 It is believed that the Chief Minister will be forced to reconsider some important decisions on the party platform
 unhen bhramit karne vaale kuch khaas salaahkaaron kii bhi chuttee ho sakati he
 But will Vijayan be ready for all these things? There are very few people who believe in this
 rajya main makapa ke ek varisht netaa ne india today ko kaha ki ''vijayan aise netaa hai jo jhukate nahin
 They will fight till the end
 ''ye nattejey congress ko rajya main phir se khadey hone kaa mauka dete hai
 All the leaders of the state Congress will be very happy with these results
 jahaan tak bhaajapa kaa sawaal he, sabarimala ke mudde par matadaataaon kaa dhruvikaran karne kii koshish bhi use kerala main seat nahin dilaa saki
 He will now have to wait a long time to make his next attempt to break into this last bastion untouched by the saffron wave that swept across the country

 is bayaan main unhone khulaasa kiya ki placement agency ne naukari dilaane kaa jhansa dekar unhen sex or nashe ke daldal main dhakel diya
 The Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday that it had written a letter to the Uganda High Commission on the issue
 mahilaon ne police upayukta (dakshin or dakshinpurv) nila mohan ke paas shikaayat darj karai he, jisamen unhone bataaya he ki is tarah kii kai placement agenciyaan dilli main or aasapaas sanchalit ho rahi hai
 These agencies push into the quagmire of drug and body trade by pretending to provide employment to African women
 videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa saiyad akbaruddin ne kaha ki unhone uganda ke ucchayog ko teenon ugandai mahilaon ko paraamarsh seva muhaiyaa karaane kaa suzav diya he
 He said, 'this morning we received a message from the Government of Delhi that on January 17, three Ugandan women who came to India requested to be sent back to Uganda because they were lured to India
 ’dilli mahila ayog ne bhi dilli ke police ayukta bi
 s
 bassi ko teenon ugandai mahilaon dwaara kiye gaye khulaase kii jaanch karne kii sifarish kii he
 Meanwhile, Delhi Women's Commission chairman Barkha Singh said that she too has demanded an inquiry into the matter
 unhone kaha, ‘maine apane patr main police ayukta se kaha he ki is maamle kii jaanch unke dwaara kii jaani chahie
 'these three women are staying in the same window extension of Malviya Nagar area, where Delhi Law Minister Somnath Bharti raided some members of' AAP 'at midnight last month against drug and body trade
 apane bayaan main mahilaon ne kaha he ki nashile padaarthon ke kaarobaar ke mafia ne unhen bandhak banaae rakhaa or unhen deh vyapaar va drugs bechney ke dhandhe main dhakel diya
 She also said that she wants protection from the government
 police ne kaha ki mahilaon ko mangalvaar ko sarkaar dwaara sanchalit pashchimi dilli ke nari niketan main bhej diya gaya
 The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government of Delhi staged a sit-in against the uncooperative attitude of the police during Somnath Bharti's raid and Ugandai women, who allegedly became victims of excesses in the raid, lodged a complaint against those who accompanied the minister in the court 
 shikaayat darj hone ke baad dilli kii ‘aap’ sarkaar or kanoon mantri somnath bharti sabhi vipakshi dalon ke nishane par rahe
 Not only this, the Delhi government also had a confrontation with the Delhi Women's Commission
 teen ugandai mahilaon ke bayaan aane ke baad somnath kii chhapemari ko sarthak bataakar ‘aap’ ek baar phir virodhiyon ko gher sakati he
 In a conversation with Aaj Tak, Anandiben said that my party will decide, no one person will decide
 anandiben ne kaha ki 2017 main patidaar bijepi ke liye koi factor nahin he
 Patidar is with me
 aaie jaanate hai anandiben ne or kya-kya kaha
 
 
 How do you see two years of your government? Whether Anandiben is successful or not, the people of Gujarat will evaluate this
 ye moolyankan main nahin karuungi kyonki koi bhi sarkaar kaam karti he to praja ke hit ke liye hi karti he
 People who raise disputes, which have not been in government for 15-20 years
 waapas sarkaar main aaenge yaa nahin aise log vivaad khadaa karte hai
 It is not that any dispute has arisen from the rest of the public and the state government has not met the demand
 isliye main jarur kahuungi rajya sarkaar ne pichley 15 saal main jitne kaam kiye hai itane kaam kisi rajya ne nahin kiya he
 Therefore, the state of Gujarat is counted as a model state
 pichley do saal main bhi kai nai yojanaaye banaain
 The Congress alleges that the promises were made but not fulfilled? anandiben-congress tell me which promise is fulfilled and which promise is not fulfilled
 congress adhyaksh bharat singh solanki kehete hai ki jo narmada baand ki yojana yaa ajukeshan institute he wo sab congress ke shashan main hue hai?anandiben-wo pahele dekhen ki narmada baandh ki hit aapke vakt main 95 metre tak pahunchi thi, isi ke baad jo hit banaai puraa kaam kiya, narmada ki canal ke liye jo jameen kaa sampadan kiya ye puraa kambijapi sarkaar nekia he
 Bharat Singh does not know because he is not in the government
 aapke samay main 95 metre se badhaane ke liye narendra bhai ko 72 ghanto kaa upwas par baithna padaa tha
 What did this forget, when the high BJP government completed it, we were making efforts since 2008 to install the Lab Gate, but still did not get the approval
 agar manjuuri milti to 2012 main get kaa kaam puraa kar dete or puure rajya main aaj jo pani kii kami mahasoos karte hai wo nahin hoti
 Those people did not work Narendra Bhai became Prime Minister and he signed the file in 17 days
 aapaki sarkaar par aarope lagata he ki aap log aisi yojana karte hai jisamen bhrashtachar hota he?anandiben-wo apane bhrashtachar ki baat pehle mujhe bataaen ki kahaan bhrashtachar hua
 Talking and proving corruption is another matter
 uske saboot dena alag baat he
 Gujarat is seen on the basis of a model state, but the figures that are kept in the Legislative Assembly
 
 
 ?anandiben-mana ye hamaari sarkaar ke aankaden hai main bataati hum ki hamane ek saal pehle chintan shivi kiya tha
 The UNICEF figures were showing, i asked what year these figures were from 2003-04
 chintan shivi 2015 main tha, letest aakanden aane chahie
 Figures come only after 10 years
 aaj gujarat ki sthiti alag he
 Two years ago, a report was presented to the BJP High Command, which was not happy with your work in Gujarat? Anandiben - Did you see the report? If you have a report let me know
 naa meri party ke paas report he, log charchaa karte honge ki report de di he or aapke saamne prashn khadaa hota he
 When i go to Delhi, the media starts immediately that i have called because of this
 vastav main hammeeting ke liejate hai
 Nor were we called for such a program
 aisi kya baat he ki log aapke liye aisi baaten karte hai?anandiben-aap hi prashn uthaate hai ore aap hi prashn kaa jawaab dete ho
 i also went to Delhi for a meeting of the Schercity
 pradhanmantri ne bulaayaa tha
 Nitin Bhai went there for Neet
 nitin bhai ki neet ke bare main, duusari ore pradhanmantri ne skeresity ki meeting bulaai thi
 Nitin Bhai met the Prime Minister? anandiben-nitin Bhai did not meet the Prime Minister
 sawaal meeting main pradhanmantri se kya baatcheet hui?anandiben-skeresity ke bare main meri baat hui
 Then again and again why is it that you are becoming Governor of Haryana or Punjab? Anandiben - i do not raise it
 naa mere kaaryakarta uthaate hai or media main aa jaataa he ki iske liye anandiban ko bulaayaa he
 Let us assume that you will remain in Gujarat as the Chief Minister? Anandiben - i will not go anywhere
 main gujarat main hi rahane vaali hum
 The way the dispute has been? Let the Anandiben dispute be in dispute
 vivaad vivaad hi hota he
 Afwa is Afwa
 isamen koi satyata nahin hoti he
 This is a pity
 phir afvaah koun failaata he?anandiben-mujhe nahin maaloom
 There was a dispute with you about giving government land to your daughter? Anandiben - then forgive me the same question
 jis main kuch nahin he sab kuch bataa diya he, phir bhi aap vahi prashn puch rahe hai
 i feel sad congress ye aarope laga rahi he ki aapaki sarkaar aapke betaa-beti chalaa rahe hai?anandiben-mere bete-beti ne meraa offis tak nahin dekha he
 There is a lot of talk in your opposition in BJP, have you ever talked to Narendra Bhai in this matter? Anandiben - This is my case
 main kyon bataaun aapako
 Whatever i talk about, why should i tell you about the policy of the state government? sanghathan kaa maamla main kyon bataaun
 The Patidar community that you come from has revolted against you for demanding reservation? Anandiben - she was not a rebel, she should not call it a rebellion
 wo ek maang thi
 All the people in the society, whether they are teachers, farmers or doctors, they put demands before the government
 ek 21 saal ke ladke hardik patel ne aapako aarakshan par sochane par majaboor kar diya?anandiben-aaj kya sthiti he, patidaar samaaj bhi samaj gaya ki ham logon ne galat kiya
 Hardik is hurting you by staying inside the jail, if he was outside, he would have done less harm? Anandiben - No harm
 churaasi ki seat ham jeet gaye
 We won the seat of Talala too after 14 years
 vahaan par bhi patel the
 We won 27 municipalities
 jisamen patel samudaay tha, 2017 main is kaa asar hoga aise nahin he, ye samajhadaar log hai
 They also understand the party and the work of the government
 to ye aane vaale samay main hamen koi nuksaan nahin hoga
 Meaning there will not be a Patidar factor in 2017? Anandiben - if it is not in the by-election, then where will it be in 2017? aapke liye political threat koun he?anandiben-meraa kaam sirf gujarat ki praja kaa kaam karne kaa he
 i do that work quietly, whether it is a leader or any of their work, i continue to serve the people
 main nahin maanati ki mere saamne congress threat he, yaa samaaj threat he
 Can you be considered a contender for the post of Chief Minister in 2017? Anandiben - i will not answer this, because only my party or my organization can answer this
 jis ki umr 70 ke paar ho jaati he unhen maardarshak mandal main rakhaa jaataa he?anandiben-acha he ki maardarshak mandal main rakhaa he
 So will you go to the guide board? Anandiben - i have no such quality that keep me in the guide board
 2017 main mukhyamantri pad ke daavedaar koun?anandiben-wo chintaa aap naa karen samay aayega sab tay ho jaayegaa
 Anandiben- Narendra Modi had won the elections in Gujarat till now with an overwhelming majority
 kya 2017 main aap jeet paaengi?anandiben-bilkulakya patidaar fact kaa asar hoga?anandiben-patidaar factor kaa koi asar nahin hoga, wo hamaare saath hi rahane vaali hai
 In 2017, you will be seen as the Chief Minister, as the Governor of a state, or in the organization? Anandiben - i will again give the same answer that the party has to give
 jo jinmedaari mujhe saunpi gai he wo jinmedaari main nibhaaoongi
 i have never demanded that i make him an educationist, keep me in the organization
 2017 ke chunaav main ranneeti kya rahegi?anandiben-hamaari ranneeti kisi ko bataane ke liye nahin hoti he
 Our work goes on
 aaj bhi dekhie hamaare kai kaarykram chalate rahete hai
 It is not that elections came, do the work of organization, do the work of government
 hamaara kaam ye karo wo karo aisa nahin he
 Whether our job is election or not, work continues
 aapaki or amit shah ki nahin banati he?anandiben-wo baar-baar gujarat thodi naa aate hai
 We meet whenever they come
 meeting karte hai
 Conversation takes place
 wo jo bataate hai ham wo kaam karte hai
 Despite all the instructions not to use the army's name for electoral gains, the leaders are not taking the name of reform

 Sadhvi Pragya has said that Congress does injustice
 unhone kaha ki narendra modi jab gujarat main mukhyamantri the us samay unpar itane aarope lagaae or wo baad main ve nirdosh sabit hue
 Similarly, Congress has tortured him for 9 years

 isse samaaj main vikrutiyaan bad rahi hai, khaskar rape jaisi ghatnaon main vruddhi ho rahi he
 According to Vinay Bihari, such a practice should be stopped, otherwise the society will collapse

 Former Finance Minister P
 chidambaram ne kaha he ki loksabhaa chunaav main upie kii haar mahangaai kii vajah se hui
 He said that the people troubled by inflation taught the UPA government a lesson in elections
 chidambaram ne kaha ki saal 2009 or 2011 ke bich diya gaya rajkoshiya protsaahan package, sarkaar kaa ek samuhik nirnay tha, jisase rajkoshiya va rajasav ghaataa zyada aage nikal gaya
 Due to this, inflation increased, due to which the UPA government had to face defeat

 It was not successful even on the test of increasing inequality
 haalanki, isamen kuch achche pahalu hai
 In his speech at the Loyla Institute of Business Administration (liba) in Chennai, Chidambaram, however, did not name President Pranab Mukherjee, who was then Finance Minister and at the same time, after the 2008 economic crisis, the central government brought an incentive package
 Decided to chidambaram ne kaha ki unhone protsaahan package kaa zikr sarsari taur par kiya tha, jisaki vajah se kendra sarkaar kaa rajkoshiya, rajasav tathaa chaalu khaataa ghate ke lakshya gadabada gaye or uskaa nateeja oonchi mahangaai ke rup main dikhaa tathaa logon ne chunaavon main sarkaar ko dandit kiya

 Chidambaram said that keeping the fiscal deficit somewhat higher than the fixed plan, the NDA government has planned to borrow an additional Rs 42,500 crore
 is raashi ko sarkaar yojana vyay nahin, balki gaiyr-yojana vyay ke taur par kharch karegi
 In response to a question, Chidambaram said that there is a need to create a fourth slab in the rates of personal income tax
 unhone yaad dilaayaa ki 1997 main pesh kiye bajet main unhone kar ke teen slab pesh kiye the, lekin udaarikaran ke baad se kuch logon kii aay main baari vruddhi ko dekhte hue unhen lagata he ki chauthaa slab rakhaa janaa jaruri he
 The former finance minister said that the state's share of central taxes has increased from 32 percent to 42 percent with the government accepting the 14th Finance Commission report, but that does not mean that the states are going to get more money
 unhone kaha, ‘is par ek lambii bahes karaae jane kii jarurat he
 He also defended the minimum alternative tax (MAT)

 dilli ke chaar bade aspataalon main khun ke kaarobaar ko lekar aaj tak ke khulaase kaa bada asar hua he
 According to information received from sources, after this sting, the health department of Delhi government is preparing to raid different hospitals
 aaj tak ne buudhvaar ko sting kar bada khulaasa kiya tha
 There is a panic of Chikungunya everywhere in the capital Delhi
 dengue or malaria ke marij bhi mil rahe hai
 Hospitals are full of patients
 dilli main AAP kii sarkaar he lekin teenon emsidi main bijepi kaa varchasv he
 While the political party is busy with allegations and counter-allegations, the patients are suffering
 is saal chikangunia kaa dengue ke mukaable zyada prakope he
 But still the dengue patients are being found
 dengue main platelets kii kami jaanaleva sabit ho sakati he
 In such a situation, brokers who sell black blood in big hospitals of Delhi are cheating silver
 jitna zyada bukhaar kaa khauf utani hi jaldimrij or timaardarin khun ke saudagaron kii giraft main funs rahe hai
 To expose these, the special investigative team of 'aaj Tak / India Today' has four big hospitals in Delhi - Loknayak Jayaprakash Hospital (LNJP), All India Institute of Medical Sciences Hospital (AIIMS), Guru Tegh Bahadur Hospital (GTB) and Ram Attended Manohar Lohia Hospital (RML)
 alengepi aspatalaelengepi aspataal main marijon kii bharmaar ke saath yahaan khun kii kalabazari karne vaale dalal dhadlle se apana kaam karte dikhe
 Here a bag was seen demanding up to Rs 3,500 for blood
 dengue ke marijon ko platelets muhaiyaa karaane ke liye 12,000 rupye unit ke hisaab se maange ja rahe hai
 Aajtak's camera captures an LNJP hospital employee
 ye emergency ward ke paas mila
 The under cover reporter told this employee that the patient is admitted in a private hospital and needs urgent blood
 ye sunate hi karmchaaree ne apane ek saathi dalal ko bula liya
 The broker said that blood will be given from the blood bank of LNJP Hospital but will not be returned in any case
 under cover reporter ke bharosa dilaane par ki khun waapas nahin karenge, aspataal ke karmchaaree or dalal ne aage baat karnaa kabool kiya
 When the reporter asked how much the money would cost, the broker said that i would ask the doctor and tell him
 phir kuch logon se phone par baat karne ke baad dalal ne ek unitkhun ke liye3,500 rupye tak kii maang kii
 Asked by the reporter that if there is blood, the broker replied, "it will be fine, don't take tension
" ' saath hi aspataal kaa karmchaaree bhi bolaa- 'ye mat socho tumhen aise hi ulta sidhaa pakadaa denge, kaam kar rahe hai yahaan, thik he, jo loge wo doge, jo doge wo loge
 'the rule of taking blood from hospitals is that the timbers have to donate blood in lieu of it
 under cover reporter ne jab kaha ki khun donnet karne kaa to koi panga nahin hoga, to dalal kaa jawaab tha- 'nahin aapako donnet nahin karnaa hoga, ham aapako aath bottle de denge lekin unhen yahaan se kaise le janaa he wo aapaki jimmedaari hogi
 'under cover reporter asked to know how far the blood merchant has access, if the platelets will be found for the dengue patient, then the broker agreed to that too
 dalal ne kaha, platelets mil to jaaenge lekin usamen time lagegaa
 The broker then asked - 'what is the patient group group?' On stating that the reporter is o positive, the broker said, "if the platelets of o positive are given to the patient, then he will benefit quickly
" 'khun kii kalabazari karne vaale kaise shaatir andaaj se network bana kar kaam karte hai, iskaa bhi 'ajtak / india today' ko pataa chalaa
 It was about platelets, the work was risky
 aspataal ke andar ho paanaa mushkil tha, aise main dalal ne apane network ke duusare sadsy se under cover reporter ko milwaaya
 He also assured that if blood is not available in the hospital, it will be provided from elsewhere
 in dallalon kaa daawa tha ki wo 12 saal se is kaam main lage hai or kisi khaas blad group ke platelets yahaan nahin mili to usee group ke blad donor muhaiyaa kara denge
 Obviously, these donors will not be the ones who voluntarily donate blood, but only the people who sell their blood
 dallalon ne 8 unit khun ke liye 28,000 rupye or teen unit blad ke platelets ke liye 36,000 rupye kii maang kii
 It is evident that the business of these blood merchants shines as much as the fear of dengue disease spreads
 amlengepi aspataal ke baad 'ajtak / india today' ne desh ke sabase bade aspataal ames kaa rukh kiya
 To know how far the roots of the black market are spread
 ames main sakhti zyada he isliye yahaan blad bank se khun tabhi miltaa he jab pehle marij kaa koi timaardaar khun donnet kare
 Despite this strictness, the blood merchants appeared fearless here too
 yahaan mahesh punjabi naam ke dalal se under cover reporter ne marij kii haalat najuk bataate hue 5 unit khun kahin se bhi jutaney ke liye kaha
 On this, the broker said that 5 to 10 or 15 units, as much as you wish, you will get blood
 jab dalal se poocha gaya ki donor kahaan se jutaoge to usne kaha ki college se ladke mangavaayenge jo khun dene kaa paisa lenge
 When the reporter asked how much money would be charged, the broker said that three thousand rupees will be taken from the unit but you will take 2800 rupees from you
 is dalal se jab o positive group ke marij ke lieplatelets uplabdhakarane ke liye kaha to usne iske liye 6000 rupye unit ke hisaab se maang kii
 When the broker was referred to the emergency, he said that the crowd at AIIMS is more, it will take more than a day to call the boys here, from blood checking, and from donating blood to taking out platelets
 jab under cover reporter ne kaha ki itnaa vakt nahin he to dalal (mahesh punjabi) ne ek or dalal ko bulaayaa
 This second broker said that the work will be done, two hours will have to be given, but it will cost more
 jab under cover reporter ne paise kam karne kii baat kii to dalal khun main white blad cells kii ahmiyat samajhane laga
 It started telling that blood is formed from platelets
 dalal se jab ye jaananaa chaha ki is tarah khun lenaa surakshit to hoga, kahin kisi drug edict kaa khun to nahin de diya jayega
 The broker said that no college boys take blood
 in dallalon ne ye bhi bataaya ki wo aise college students se khun lete hai jinke kharche zyada hote hai or wo unhen puraa karne ke liye ye rasta apanaate hai
 According to the claims of the brokers, not only Delhi, Noida, Greater Noida and Ghaziabad boys are also involved in the black marketing of blood
 iske baad dalal boni kii baat karne lage
 Said give one thousand rupees now after the rest of the work is done
 aakhir dalal boni ke taur par 200 rupye lene par hi raji ho gaya
 Blood merchants are also unaware of the raid on the brokers in hospitals
 dalal mahesh punjabi ne ek din pehle safadarajang aspataal main red padane kii baat khud hi bataai
 GTB Hospital In the sequel to expose the people involved in the crime of blood, 'aaj Tak / India Today' reached GTB Hospital, the view there was no different
 ajtak kii team ko jitibi aspataal ke get number 7 kii parking ke baahar hi khun kaa saudagar mil gaya
 Seeing the face, he said that he has come from outside? Reporter- 'yes, B-ve
 'dalal- 'wo to group yahaan hoga tabhi denge
 
 
 Its money will be deposited
 'reporter- 'koi nahin, donor nahin he hamaare paas
 "dalal" - You don't have a donor
 'reporter- 'kya lagegaa donor kaa?'dalal - 'ek donor kaa 3500 rupee
 The 'reporter-' donor should be clean
 'dalal – 'donor to ham apana bhejegein saaf-suthra bhejegein
 We send a little like this
 sab kuch check-ap hota he andar
 'reporter -' get it done
 'ye sab jaanane ke baad aapako samaj aa gaya hoga ki khun ke saudagar kis tarah rate set kar is gorakhdhandhe ko anjaam dene main lage hai
 RML Hospital As part of the campaign to expose the network of blood black marketers spread over large hospitals in Delhi, the situation did not get any different there when the Aaj Tak / India Today team reached RML Hospital
 under cover reporter ne yahaan blad bank karmchaaree sachin se khun kii jarurat jataate hue sampark kiya
 Reporter - 'how can we get blood?' Sachin - 'whatever happens donate
 'reporter - 'kitna paisa lagegaa
 'sachin -' 10,000 Rupees
 'reporter - '10,000 rupee prati unit'sachin - 'haa
 'reporter-' for platelets? 'sachin-' Brother will have to ask
 'sachin - 'do unit edjust kar denge, baaki do baad main arange hongi
 'reporter -' Anil ji
 
 
 
 From Red Cross? 'sachin -' You know them
 'reporter - 'aap hi ne bataaya
 'sachin -' Anil ji has said that he has a relative there
 wo manage kar lenge
 'reporter -' how much will it cost
 'sachin - 'ankal ne pehle hi bataa diya he, 30,000 rupee
 'reporter -' How? 'sachin -' You need platelets too, don't you? 'reporter -' Platelets too
 
 
 15,000 rupee?'sachin - 'prati unit
 'reporter -' this is too much
 'sachin - 'zyada? kyon? ham platelets bhi de rahe hai
 You will not find these anywhere and you are still searching for money
 aapako ye kahin nahin milenge
 See you here and there
 aapkaa kaam ho jayega
 'reporter -' from Red Cross only

 AAP MP Bhagwant Mann was suspended for the remaining term of the current winter session, based on the recommendation of a committee of the Lok Sabha investigating the matter of videography of the Parliament House complex
 sadan ne maan maamle kii jaanch samiti kii sifarish ko manjuur karne ke prastaav ko dhvanimat se sweekaar kiya
 a committee headed by BJP member Kirit Somaiya, probing the improper conduct of AAP member, in its report tabled in Lok Sabha yesterday, said that the conduct of Member of Parliament Bhagwant Mann is highly objectionable which shows that basic knowledge, etiquette and the position he holds Are clueless, ignorant of his responsibilities
 report main kaha gaya he, ‘‘apane galat aacharan se bhagwant maan ne sansad bhawan or usase jude logon kii suraksha ko khatre main daalaa he
 Further, Mann did not adopt a coherent and balanced view in his reply to the committee
 unke uttaron main antarnihit virodhabhaason ko spasht karne ke liye die gaye anek avasaron ke pashchaat hi unhone swayan main sudhaar kiya or 28 november ko samiti ko bataaya ki vah apane purvavarti patron ko aanshik rup se waapas le rahe hai or iske liye bina shart maafee maang rahe hai
 The committee said that in its e-mail message on December 6, 2016, Bhagwant Mann again repeated the same paragraph, saying, "I categorically deny that there has been any mistake on my part in the security system of Parliament
" 
 ’’ The report said that Mann also denied that he had videographed the Parliament House property and its installations and any security arrangements in the Parliament House complex or as it is alleged to have uploaded some important footage
 report ke mutabik samiti mahasoos karti he ki maan ke patr main baar-baar vahi virodhabhas dikhaai detaa he or isliye is tarah se samiti se maafee maangane ko bina shart maafee maangana nahin kaha ja saktaa he

 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has once again advocated reservation for women in Parliament
 unhone kaha ki mahilaon ko agar aarakshan miltaa he to acchhee baat he or iskaa mudda loksabhaa main laana chahie, rajyasabha main sanshodhit ho gaya he
 Please tell that Nitish Kumar and his party have always been in support of 33 percent women reservation, but his party MP and former party president Sharad Yadav has been opposing women reservation
 ab sharad yadav bhi party ke baagi netaa ban chuke hai or jediu se unhen nikaalane kii puri taiyaari bhi ho chuki he
 In such a situation, Nitish Kumar and his party are now completely in favor of women reservation
 nitish kumaar hameshaa se mahila aarakshan ke paksh main rahe hai iskaa pramaan he ki bihar main sthaneey niyakon ko chunaavon main mahilaon ke liye 50 pratishat kaa aarakshan pehle se hi lagu he
 Also, there is 33 percent reservation for their jobs in various government departments
 police main to aarakshan badhkar 36 pratishat tak chalaa gaya he
 Therefore, they believe that the Women's Reservation Bill passed by Rajya Sabha should be introduced in Lok Sabha also so that 33 percent seats for women can be reserved in Parliament and Legislatures as well
 nitish kumaar ne haal hi main sarkari vibhaagon main outsorcing ke madhyam se contract amplise main bhi aarakshan lagu kar diya he
 According to the decision of the cabinet, now the rules of reservation will also apply to outsourcing personnel
 nitish kumaar kaa kahana he ki jin sarkari sevaaon main sarkari paise se vetan diya jaataa he un par aarakshan kaa niyam lagu hona chahie or isi aadhaar par ise lagu kiya gaya he
 The BJP in the government has also supported Nitish Kumar's decision

 html karnataka ke saanskrithik nagar mysuru main kuch logon ke liye devtaa kaa samay thodaa jaldi shuru ho gaya
 On September 18, just a day before the departure of Goddess Durga, about a hundred people embarked on a mythological journey to descend on Earth
 chamundi paharipoon par sthit mahisasur kii vishalkay murti par phulon kii varsha karne ke liye ashokapuram kii dalit colony se motorcykilon kaa jhund nikal padaa
 The 12-foot-tall idol, painted in bright colors and with a scary mustache, was founded by Jayakamrajendra Wadiyar, the last Maharaja of Mysuru
 iske ek haath main talwaar he or duusare haath main saanp
 This idol is built in the 1940s at the entrance of the ancient Chamundeshwari temple of Goddess Durga
 lekin yah pehali baar tha jab mahisasur ko pratishtha mili
 His devotees chanted, "we are the original inhabitants of here, the original inhabitants of Mysuru
" '' unke bhakton kaa kahana he, ''ve koi rakshas nahin, balki ek nek raja the, jinhone misuru ko uskaa naam diya
 He is God to us
 '' durga puja kii dhoomdhaam se shuruyaat ke saath hi das haathon main hathiyaaron se las virangana durga ke chirshatru, jinka devi ne buraai ke viruddh achchhai ke yuddh main sanhaar kiya tha, ab hinduon ke 33 karod devi-devataaon kii suchi main sthaan paane lage hai
 And in this case they are not alone
 dhire-dhire kai nae devi-devtaa pratishtha paakar puuje jane lage hai
 Who are the deities, what do they get by pleasing them and why are they coming out? Who are these deities? No, Nathuram Godse, who killed Mahatma Gandhi on January 30, 1948, is currently the deity
 The place has not been found, but they too may find it, as the All India Hindu Mahasabha is trying to install their idol in temples across the country
 kya naarad muni kabhi devtaa the? lekin ab hai
 The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, in its mouthpiece Organizer, has described this muni known as the one who delivers it here
 duniya bhale hi may maheene main vishwa press diwas manaati ho lekin sangh parivaar ke liye yah maheenaa naarad jayanti kaa tha, jisamen kuch patrakaron ko naarad sammaan se sammanit kiya gaya, puja kii gai, vrath rakhaa gaya, bauddhik sabhaayen kii gayi, prarthanaayen or goshtiyaan vagairah yojit kii gayi
 Now take the Khodiyar mother of the Patidars of Gujarat
 rajkot ke paas khodldham main unka bhavy mandir banane se pehle hi devi khodiar maa ko giness book of valrd recodrs main sthaan mil gaya
 In January, more than 300,000 Patidars called each other to organize in his name and secure their interests
 ve ek magaramchh kii sawari karti hai, unki filmein or mujeec album hai, internet par bhi unhen sthaan hasil he, puure gujarat, rajasthan or mumbai main unke chote-chote mandir hai
 Apart from this, there is also a Shadsha Matya i

 Many films have been made on him and music albums have also been made in his name
 unki puja mul rup se rajasthan or gujarat kii adivasee or choti samajhi jane vaali jatiyaan karti thim, lekin unki mahima ab maharashtra main bhi pahunch gai he
 The wishes of her devotees that she fulfills include the desire to buy a car

 a six-foot-tall statue of sage Valmiki made of gold sheet was installed at the site where he is believed to have composed the Ramayana and where Sita gave birth to lav-kush

 He also said that before this no one in Punjab has done such work for Dalits, whereas this state has the highest population of Dalits
 ek daivi pratikahar nai devi yaa nayaa devtaa ek pratik he jo pahchaan or raajnneeti ke sawaal se judaa he
 Pratap Bhanu Mehta, president of the Center for Policy Research in Delhi, says, "symbols have no objective truth about themselves
 '' pratik main arthon kii bahulata hoti he yani usamen kai arth nihit hote hai
 He adds, "it is used as a means of propaganda, publicity, collective understanding or display of status and power

 It is possible that there is someone around you who is weaving this trap
 to dekhie or bachie
 What got entangled in this web, he went through work and also by name
 kyonki ye wo jaal he jo ab tak naa maaloom kaiyon ke ji kaa janjaal ban chukaa he
 Surprisingly, the person trapped in this trap does not seem to get the slightest idea that he is going to get entangled in such a trap of beauty and deceit that the more he tries to get out, the more he will get entangled in it
 
 jaal bunane vaale sirf teen logaye puraa jaal ek band kamare me buna jaataa he
 There are only three people who weave nets
 or inhen teenon ke haath main jaal kaa puraa sira he
 These three have gathered in this room for a special mission at this time
 mishan oparation jaal main shikaar fansna or inhen itanjar he to bas ek adad shikaar kii
 After some special preparation in the room, the trio are desperate to carry out their plot
 kamare ke andar kaa kaam puraa ho chukaa tha
 Now the issue is outside the room
 lihaaja teenon hotel se baahar nikalate hai or phir uski talash shuru ho jaati he jise inke jaal main funsana he
 After a short wait, this quest is also completed

 There are many eyes in this room right now staring at them both

 Obviously you will understand this game a little bit now
 aapako ehsaas ho rahaa hoga ki band kamare main aakhir koun sa jaal buna ja rahaa he? ek khubasurat ladki
 Camera play in the room
 
 
 or inke jaal main ek shikaar funs bhi chukaa he or use is baat kaa zaraa bhi ilm nahin ki jaise hi wo is kamare ke baahar kadam rakhega to uske saath bhi blakemeling kaa wo khel shuru ho jayega

 ashleel video banane ke baad maangate the phirotien ferbiyon kii website kii tagaline thi nae logon se milane kii jagah
 By putting her beautiful pictures on this site, she befriends people and then starts a very funny and funny game of hers
 dosti karne ke baad monica apane shikaar ko milane ke ke liye bulaati
 Being trapped in Husn's web, his victim would get trapped in his trap
 monica pehle to apane shikaar ko kidanap karti or phir unka ashleel video banaati
 And then the ransom game begins
 husn ke is jaal main uskaa saath dete the uske do videshi dost

 But during this time the Delhi Police was continuously trapping Monika's phone and the police arrested Monica and her two companions from a CR Park house

 The largest data breach has been done in the history of Facebook
 havers ne lagbhag 5 karodfesabuscounts ko prabhavit kiya he
 The company's hackers have tampered with the code of the social network
 fasebuk ke mutabik jis khaamiyon kaa sahaara lekar havers ne aisa kiya he use thik karne ke liye ptch jari kiya gaya he
 The question of users is that the accounts which have been affected, are they being used wrongly? However, Facebook has made it clear that password and payment system are not affected by this hacking
 fasebuk ke siio mark jakarberg ne ek statement main kaha he, ‘hamaari shuruaati jaanch main ab tak aisa nahin dikhaa he jisase pataa chale kii token ko yuj karte hue havers ne kisi ke privet massej yaa post acces kiya he’tokens ke jariye hui hekkingkya he token?gauratlab he ki havers ne acces tokens ke jariye fasebuk acounts ko prabhavit hue he
 Through Access Token, users can stay online on Facebook continuously for a long time and for this they do not have to enter the password again
 fasebuk ne kaha he ki company 50 million tokens ko riset kiya he or duusare 40 million yugers ke token bhi jaanch kiye gaye hai
 Facebook is under investigation and more turning points may come
 kya aapkaa acount isekkingse prabhavit heis hekking kaa asar jin yugers par padaa he wo khud se log out ho gaye hai
 If this has happened to you too, then log in again with your password
 news feed ke sabase upar fasebuk An Important security update kaa binar degaa
 Here you will find information about data breech
 agar aap 90 million main se nahin he phir bhi fasebuk pricoshan ke taur par aapako acount log out karne ko kahata he
 Doing this will reset all the tokens
 mobile se hi nahin, balki desktop se bhi aap aisa kar sakate hai
 Change the password
 haalanki fasebuk kaa kahana he ki havers ne acces token hack kiye hai password sef hai
 But cyber security experts believe that you should change the password
 tu factor othentication ko on kar len
 Check the app login and remove the non-essential apps facebook is removing the affected apps by itself, but you should check with yourself whether the apps that you have logged in with Facebook, have given them access to your Facebook
 Can you trust them? If not, then remove those apps from these app logins
 kyonki wo ap hi aise token kaa istemaal karte hai jisase bina password enter kiye he lambey samay tak fasebuk par logd in rah sakate hai
 People who do not belong to economics often refer to this topic as a frustrating science

" unhone kaha ki bhavishya main jalwaayu parivartan par padane vaale prabhaav ke bare main bhavishyavaanee atyant niraashajanak kii shrenee main aayega
 "despite this, this type of analysis is a very essential task," he said
 ye chijen buniyadi samasyaon ke prati dhyaan akshirt karti hai
 If these problems are not resolved in time, then they will reach a critical situation which will be difficult to deal with
 ’’manmohan singh ne kaha ki hamaare aalochakon ko yah yaad rakhana chahie ki ham arthshaastri samasyaon par dhyaan kendrit karte hai
 Its purpose is to attract people's attention to these problems and find possible solutions
 ham yah maanate hai ki samasya ke prati dhyaan akshirt karne se uskaa hal nikalegaa
 The Prime Minister said that these things are clearly reflected in our experience in developing concepts on various issues related to socio-economic goals in India

 agar aapako gajiabad se noida janaa ho to auto sabase suvidhajanak saadhan he lekin singla-agarwal ke jugnu ap ke aane se pehle yah kaaphi mushkil kaam tha
 Auto people used to ask for arbitrary money, but using the Firefly app makes the auto appear in minutes and it is pleasant to travel on a fixed fare
 amuman gajiabad-noida ke bich chalane vaale auto driver chetaraam jugnu ap aadhaarit auto seva se jude hue hai
 If they believe, now there is no waiting for the passengers
 din bhar main 20-25 savaariyaan aasaani se mil jaati hai
 When the drivers associated with the auto aggregator service Jugnoo deliver food from restaurants to homes and offices when they are not carrying the passengers
 or aisa jugnu ke seva vistaar kii vajah se sambhav ho sakaa he
 The story of Jugnu started from Chandigarh in November 2014
 ap aadhaarit auto seva jugnu iity, dilli ke do aalaa dimaagon, samar singla or chinmay agarwal kii upaj he
 This start-up started in a very interesting way
 samar or chinmay iity dilli ke robotics club main saath padhate the
 Together, they created the food delivery app Click Labs
 punjab ejineering college 2014 ke apane salanaa fest main clic labs ko praayojak bananaa chahta tha
 Chinmay released an app as an experiment for Fest students and teachers here, which could be called an auto rickshaw
 pehle din is ap ko 90 savaariyaan mili thim
 From the second day onwards it became popular
 phir chandigarh main ap aadhaarit is autoricshaw seva kii vidhivat shuruyaat ho gai
 "within three-four months, it has rode more than 1,000 times," recalls Chinmay
 hamen laga ki isamen apaar sambhaavnaaen hai
 “there are around 50 lakh autorickshaws in the country, which daily cost Rs 46 crore
 kaa kaarobaar karte hai
 Samar, who is associated with Europe's famous CERN lab, says, "according to the company's research, only 30 per cent of the capacity of these autos was being utilized in the country
 jugnu ne is dohan kshamta ko 70 fisadi tak pahunchaa diya he
 "the second and third tier cities had a problem with the basic principle of demand and supply of autorickshaws," recalls Chinmay
 is baat ne hamen mauka diya
 We resorted to technology, acting as a bridge between drivers and riders
 "nae kaam ko lekar donon ke pariwaron ne bhi bahut samarthan diya
 Samar recalls that his father had ordered food through this app and he reached him in a very short time
 isse samar ko bahut khushi mili thi
 He gives the details of the journey ahead, "we wanted to capture the big market, so we made the app available on both Android and IOS platforms
" "nivesh ke sambandh main chinmay kaa apana akalan rahaa, ''shuruaati daur main chunautiyaan kam nahin thim
 But then there were investors who wanted to keep the company's idea alive
 jugnu ko pehali baar bahari puunji 2015 ke april maheene main hasil hui
 That capital was used for its expansion and technology upgrades across the country
 teen daur kii funding ke baad company ne ab tak 90 karod ru
 Has raised more than Rs

 Today, Jugnu's app has more than 85,000 autorickshaws in 39 cities of the country
 inamen se kareeb 15,000 saptahik rup se sakriy hote hai
 He has more than 43 lakh riders, who have so far 1
 5 karod se zyada baar safar kiya he
 Summer attributes this to the company's technological advancement
 isaki vajah se jugnu ''behad sthaneey bahuuddeshy" ap ban gaya he, jiskaa istemaal saamaanya safar se lekar online khaane ke order dene tak kahin bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 "we cater to the immediate needs of the consumers," says Chinmay and Samar
 berokatoke sanchaalan ke liye shashakt management plateform kii in-house takanic viksit kii gai
 We also added features such as route optimization, geo-analytics and auto-allocation to the app for timely delivery challenges
 "jugnu kii upyogita 10 fisadi masik kii dar se bad rahi he
 At this stage it should be considered better
 jugnu ke vistaar kii hi yojanaon main ek seva ''fatafat" bhi he, jo on-demand concidar sarvice he
 It is a chat based interface in which the user can send their request, share the details of pick and drop
 is sarvice kaa istemaal har tarah kii delivery ke liye kiya ja saktaa he, chaahe bekri se kek yaa chocolate mangavani ho yaa nayaa mobile khareednaa ho yaa phir ghar main kisi plumber yaa bijli mistari ko bulaanaa ho—''fatafat" har seva ke liye uplabdh he
 Jugnu's business model is very simple
 company apni seva se jude autowalon se 10 fisadi kaa kamishan vasuulati he
 That is, a company commission is made with every ride
 aisa hi saamaan yaa online order pahunchane par bhi hota he
 Jugnu's biggest competitor Ola has 1
5 lakh autos in 80 cities of the country
 ola or ubar ko chunauti dene ke liye jugnu ab cab bhi uplabdh kara rahaa he
 "we have also provided cab service as an experiment in Gurgaon," says Chinmay
 jab duusare cab agrigater cab kii hadtaal jhel rahe the to hamen laga, yahi sahi mauka he or tab hamane apane system main 1,000 kaaren uplabdh karain
 Nevertheless, our basic service remains as an auto aggregator

 How strange that September 4 was his birthday, and he passed away on this day
 khabar milte hi aadesh kaa 35 saal pehle kaa vah cheharaa saamne aa gaya, jo jabalpur ke polidor orcestra ke sho main najar aata tha
 Mandir Srivastava, filled with the immense energy of music practice, started to listen to the audience with his skill on stage in the 80s
 vah jaiz or anya ridamik vaadya bajaate the
 The audience found him immersed in rhythm with the music wave
 unke bhai chithresh shrivastav bhi is band kaa hissaa the
 Apart from Adesh Polydor in the 80s and 90s, another band of Jabalpur city also kept their talent in the huge orchestra
 samay ke saath jabalpur ke yah vaadya vrund (orcestra) band hote gaye or aadesh shrivastav ne bhi madhyapradesh ke is shahar se bollywood kii ore rukh kar liya
 After a long time, Nine met Srivastava in 2006 in Jabalpur, nine years ago
 vah apane shahar main unke skool government model skool ke vaarshik sammelan main aae the
 When i brought back memories of the days of Jabalpur and Orchestra with him, he said that if he had not gone to Mumbai then he would never have gone
 aapako yah bataata chaluun ki aadesh shrivastav ek madhyamvargeey parivaar se the or unke pita railway main sevarat the
 The comments aise kareeb sabhi pariwaron main santan se yahi apeksha kii jaati he ki vah jald pard likhakar kisi naukari par lagakar aatmanirbhar ho jaae
 The order was on such a different way that he could get complacency but it was impossible to go through the orchestra
 aaj bhi chote shaharon main chhutput sanchalit kiye ja rahe band ameor hi hai
 The order said that there was no way out
 jabalpur na chodta to kya karata? pehle kai din tak sangeet main bhavishya ko lekar uhapoh main fansaa rahaa or phir tay kiya ki ab mumbai jaakar sangharsh karne ke alaava koi vikalp nahin he
 Reached Mumbai, wandered there in search of work for a long time
 chote-chote maukey milte rahe or phir 1994 main aakhirkaar film 'aao pyaar karen' main bataur sangeet nirdeshak avasar mil hi gaya
 Aadesh Srivastava married Vijeta Pandit, sister of noted singer, actress Sulakshana Pandit and music director jatin-lalit
 vijeyata ne san 1980 main film 'lav story' se bataur abhinetri filmi duniya main kadam rakhaa tha
 She then appeared in a few films
 'aao pyaar karen' ke baad aadesh shrivastav ne lagaataar kai filmon main sangeet diya
 He gave music in more than a hundred films which became quite popular
 inamen 'chalate-chalate', 'bagwan', 'babul', 'rifuji', 'kabhi khushi kabhi gam' or 'raajnneeti' jaisi kai filmon kaa samdhur sangeet logon ko lambey samay tak yaad rahegaa
 Aadesh Srivastava made his own identity in the Bollywood music world
 90 ke dashak ke baad film sangeet main ek khaas badlaav dikhaai dene laga jisamen gayak vaadya sangeet ke peeche jaataa dikhaai detaa he
 But the order always gave the singer a lead
 film kii maang ke mutabik tadak-bhadak hone ke baavjood unke sangeet main madhurata he
 Aadesh went from Jabalpur to Mumbai
 
 
 vahaan tumne apni swaron kii duniya basaai
 
 
 You got everything you wanted there
 
 
 lekin yah kya, ab duniya se hi vidaa ho gaye
 i had high hopes for you right now
 
 
 tumhaare sangeet kii abhi or jarurat thi
 Goodbye order Srivastava
 
 You will always be alive with your music
 80 or 90 ke dashak main aadesh polidor ke alaava jabalpur shahar ke ek anya band vishaal orcestra main bhi apni pratibha kaa loha manavaate rahe
 Over time, this instrumental Vrind (orchestra) of Jabalpur stopped and Aadesh Srivastava also turned to Bollywood from this city of Madhya Pradesh
 lambey arase ke baad nau saal pehle 2006 main aadesh shrivastav se jabalpur main hi mulaakaat hui
 He came to the annual conference of his school Government Model School in his city
 maine unke saath jab jabalpur or orcestra ke dinon kii yaaden taaja kin to unhone kaha ki yadi tab mumbai na jaataa to kabhi na ja paata
 Let me tell you that Adesh Srivastava was from a middle class family and his father was serving in the railways
 tippaniyan In almost all such families, it is expected from the child that soon after studying and writing, he should become self-sufficient on some job
 aadesh isse juda aisi raah par the jisase vah aatmasantosh to paa sakate the lekin orcestra se guzaara chalaanaa naammumkin tha
 Even today, there are only bands amateur operated in small cities
 aadesh ne bataaya tha ki rasta to koi bhi nahin tha
 What would he have done if he had not left Jabalpur? For the first several days, there was a lot of anxiety about the future in music and then decided that now there is no option but to go to Mumbai and fight
 mumbai pahunchaa, vahaan lambey samay tak kaam kii talash main bhatka
 Small opportunities continued and then in 1994 finally the opportunity came as a music director in the film 'aao Pyaar Karen'
 aadesh shrivastav ne janimani gayika, abhinetri sulakshana pandit or sangeet nirdeshak jatin-lalit kii bahan vijeyata pandit se shaadi kii
 In 1980, Vijeta entered the film world as an actress from the film 'love Story'
 iske baad vah kuch filmon main or ain
 After ‘aao Pyaar Kareen’, Aadesh Srivastava gave music in several consecutive films
 sau se adhik filmon main unhone sangeet diya jo ki kaaphi lokapriy hua
 Among them, the melodious music of many films like 'chalte Chalte', 'bagwan', 'babul', 'refugee', 'kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham' and 'rajneeti' will be remembered by people for a long time
 aadesh shrivastav ne bollywood kii sangeet kii duniya main apni alag pahchaan banaai
 After the 90s, a significant change was seen in film music, in which the singer appears to be following the instrumental music
 lekin aadesh ne gayak ko hameshaa lead di
 The film has a melody in spite of being flamboyant as per the demand
 aadesh tum jabalpur se mumbai gaye
 
 
 You settled your vowel world there
 
 
 tumhen vahaan vah sab mila, jo tumne chaha
 
 
 But what this, now departed from the world itself
 abhi tumse bahut ummid thi
 
 
 Your music was still needed

 Amid speculation of alliance with Congress in Delhi, Aam Aadmi Party has become an attacker on Rahul Gandhi
 AAP netaa gopal raay ne congress par bijepi ko majboot karne or vipaksh ko kamjor karne kaa aarope lagaaya he
 The Aam Aadmi Party also questioned Rahul's strategy in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections
 gopal raay ne ek press conference ke dauraan rahul gandhi ke kerala se chunaav ladane kaa mudda uthaaya
 He said that in the current environment of politics, when the whole country is fighting unitedly against the dictator government of PM Narendra Modi, in such a situation, to announce on behalf of the Congress party that Rahul Gandhi will contest from Kerala too, to surprise a lot
 Going to do
 congress kar rahi voton kaa bantwaraaf netaa ne kaha ki aaj puure desh main sabhi vipakshi partiyon evam desh kii janata ke bich yahi he charchaa he, ki aakhir aisi kya vajah he ki rahul gandhi ne piem modi kii taanaashaahee ke khilaaf ladane kii bajaae puure desh main vipaksh ke mukhya kendron ko nishaanaa bana rahe hai
 Questioning the Congress for not allocating seats for the Lok Sabha elections, AAP leader Gopal Rai said that even within Uttar Pradesh, the Congress is trying its best to divide the votes there, inside West Bengal, the Congress is doing its best It has been that there will be a division of votes there, even within Andhra Pradesh, the Congress is trying to get the votes divided there
 bijepi ke madadgaar, vynad se ummidavaarmaaf netaa gopal raay kaa kahana he ki kerala jahaan par left wing kaa ek majboot janaadhar he, vahaan se chunaav ladane kaa elaan karnaa is baat ko darshata he ki congress party or rahul gandhi kii praathamikta bijepi or piem modi kii taanaashaahee se mukti dilaane kii jagah, kahin na kahin bijepi ko madad pahunchane kii he
 Question 3 to Rahul Gandhi of AAP- If Rahul Gandhi wants to contest from South, why not Kerala or Karnataka or Tamil Nadu? 2- Is the Congress under any kind of pressure from the present Modi government, what is the helplessness? Due to which the Congress has to take such decisions? 3- Rahul Gandhi explain why he is engaged in weakening the opposition instead of saving the country? Gopal Rai further said that recently The by-election results in Jind to Riana also showed that if the opposition is united in Haryana could be defeated BJP Haryana's 10 seats
 haryana ke congress ke netaa bhi yahi chaahate hai ki haryana main vipaksh ekajute hokar chunaav lade
 But Rahul Gandhi has not yet given any thought to that
 AAP ne gathbandhan par congress ko gheram aadmi party ne dilli main gathbandhan par faisla na karne ko lekar rahul gandhi par nishaanaa saadhaa
 Gopal Rai said that for the last 3 months the Congress has been in a strange dilemma
 puri dilli kii janata chaahati he ki dilli main vipaksh ekajute hokar chunaav lade or dilli or desh ko piem modi kii taanaashaahee se chhutkaaraa dilaae
 But in the last 3 months, Congress Party and Rahul Gandhi could not take a small decision whether to do coalition or not
 gathbandhan par gol-mol AAP ke boldilli main gathbandhan ko lekar congress ke saath sahmati na banane ke sawaal par gopal raay gol mol jawaab dete najar aae
 He said that despite the Aam Aadmi Party having a thousand differences with the Congress, we are standing with the opposition
 prastaav kii baat puraani ho chuki he
 The Congress decision is only strengthening the BJP
 iske baad sawaal poocha gaya ki kya congress se seat shering ko lekar maamla atak rahaa he? gopal raay ne jawaab dete hue kaha ki abhi to congress ne gathbandhan ko lekar hi hami nahin bhari, seat tak to baat pahunchi hi nahin

 com / cu0685c1gp— Lyca Productions (@lycaproductions)december 3, 2018 Can consider Citizenship Bill differently - Sanjay Rautmodi government's number game in Rajya Sabha may be spoiled Shiv Sena, which supports the Citizenship Amendment bill in Lok Sabha, has taken a big decision
 shivasena netaa sanjay raut ne kaha ki loksabhaa main bill kaa samarthan karne ke baavjood bhi rajyasabha main naagarikta sanshodhan vidheyak par ham alag vichaar kar sakate hai
 Shiv Sena has three members in the Rajya Sabha
 agar shivasena naagarikta sanshodhan bill ke khilaaf vot karti he to modi sarkaar kaa rajyasabha main number game bighad saktaa he
 Currently, there are 119 members in support of the Modi government, while the opposition has 100 members
 shivasena ko jod le to yah aankada 103 ho jaataa he
 The stance of 19 Rajya Sabha members is not clear
 rajyasabha main kya he ganitabta den kinaagarikta sanshodhan vidheyacaloksabhaa main aasaani se paas ho gaya he or ab modi sarkaar buudhvaar ko ise rajyasabha main pesh karegi
 The government had no problem in passing this bill because of the JDU, Shiv Sena, BJD and some parties from the Northeast coming in favor of the Citizenship Amendment Bill
 loksabhaamein is bill ke paksh main 311 vot pade
 Whereas, 80 votes in opposition
 ab modi sarkaar kii rajyasabha main bhi raah aasaan maani ja rahi he
 The Citizenship Amendment Bill proposes granting Indian citizenship to the Hindu, Jain, Christian, Sikh, Buddhist and Parsi communities of Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan
 is vidheyak se muslim samudaay ko baahar rakhaa gaya he
 The central government had to withdraw from discussing the Citizenship Amendment Bill in Rajya Sabha due to opposition from these parties
 congress sahit kai vipakshi dal naagarikta sanshodhan vidheyak ko lekar kaaphi aakraamak he
 But the Modi government, along with the JDU and the BJD, did the arithmetic of the House in its favor

 He comes in the dark of night and the head of any person who is alone in the deserted places disappears in the darkness crushed by stones
 is tarah ye shaks pichley dedh maheene main teen logon kii jaan le chukaa he
 But after every murder he does not forget to challenge the police
 kyonki har katl ke baad wo apane shikaar ke mobile se hi phone kar unke gharavaalon ko katl kii soochna bhi detaa he
 After all, who is this stone murderer? What else is the secret of this stone man? In the city of Rajkot, Gujarat, on the morning of Wednesday, April 20, the police found a corpse in the railway area of the city
 laash kaa sir kisi baari pathar se buree tarah kuchlaa gaya he
 And there is also a stone stained with blood nearby
 jise dekh lagata he kimarne vaale kii jaanapathar se kuchal kar hi lee gai he
 But before the police advance their investigation, he learns a shocking thing
 wo ye ki kaatil ne marane vaale shaks ke ghar usee ke mobile se ek kol kiya tha
 And he had said 'I have dripped it
 jo kar sakate ho, kar lo
 'five days after the incident happened again, exactly five days after the incident i
e
 on the morning of Tuesday, April 25, another such incident comes up
 is baar laash shahar ke gandhigram ilaake se mili he
 But this time also the head of the corpse is crushed with a heavy stone
 abhi police paanch din pehle hue us katl ke saath is nai vaardaat ko jod kar dekh hi rahi hoti he ki use ek ajeeb si baat pataa chalati he ki uske hosh ud jate hai
 Because this time also, the killer has called the deceased's mobile phone to his family members
 or phir vahi baat kahi he 'maine isko tapakaa diya he
 Whatever you can do, do it! ”now the police seems to think that the same person or gang is behind these two incidents
 jo naa sirf pattharon se kuchal kar logon kii jaan le rahaa he, balki marane vaale ke gharavaalon ko phone kar ek hi tarah se daraa bhi rahaa he or chunauti bhi de rahaa he
 On finding the third corpse, the police now intensify their investigation
 wo har haal main maamle kii tah tak jald se jald pahunchnaa chaahati he
 But after passing several days neither the motive of the murder nor the murderer is revealed
 udhar, dhire-dhire logon kii yaaddaasht se donon hi vaakye dhundhalane lagate hai
 But exactly 38 days later
 guuruuvaar, 2 june ko ek or aisi vaardaat saamne aati he, jisase pulisavaalon ke saath-saath aam shahriyon ke pairon tale bhi jameen khisak jaati he
 And this time the third corpse found by stones is found in the city
 chunki is baar bhi laash subah hi mili he, shaq he ki pehle do katl kii tarah is baar bhi vaardaat raat ke andhere main hi anjaam di gai he
 And look at the story that this time also the murderer has called the family of the deceased
 or is baar bhi phone par vahi do panktiyaan kahin
 Obviously, it is now clear that all three cases have not only a very close relationship with each other, but all three are the only culprits of murder, who are killing not only one people
 balki unheen ke mobile se unke gharavaalon ko phone kar unhen daraane or rulaane kii koshish kar rahaa he
 But the question is, who is this person? And why is he killing people one by one? All the police know about the murderer
 
 
 stone main ke khauf ne rajkot shahar kii raaton kii neend haraam kar di he
 People who are lonely in secluded places want to return home early
 kya pataa
 When, where the stone man comes from
 or sir kuchal kar aage nikal jaae
 But how vicious this stone man is, it can be gauged from the fact that he loots his victim's mobile phone after the murder, but never makes the mobile again after making a call to his family members
 shahar main stone main kaatil khulaa gum rahaa he
 And despite the passing of forty days that started this murder, the hands of the police are empty
 police agar is rahasyamayi kaatil ke bare main le de kar kuch jaanati he, to sirf itnaa ki pichley chalis dinon main isgumanaam kaatilne naa sirf ek-ek kar teen logon ko maut ke ghat utaara he, balki har baar pathar se sir kuchal kar logon kii jaan lene ke baad unke gharavaalon ko ek hi tareeke se phone kar katl kii khabar bhi di he
 What is the real motive behind the murder? During the investigation, the police came to know that with each murder, the murderer looted the money and money of the deceased, as well as their mobile phone
 aise main ab police ko philhal ye samaj main nahin aa rahaa he aakhir in katl ke peeche kaa asli makasad kya he? agar makasad lut kaa he, to phir kaatil ek hi tarah se pattharon se kuchal kar apane shikaar kii jaan kyon le rahaa he or kyon har baar wo phone kar vaardaat kaa shikaar hue logon ke gharavaalon ko dukhi karata he? or agar katl ke peeche koi or vajah he, to wo kya he? kya ye kisi psico killer kii karatuut he? yaa phir police se khaar khaae kisi aise gunahagar kii harakat, jo use chalange karne ke liye yun ek-ek kar begunaahon kii jaan le rahaa he
 There are many questions and at present, the Rajkot police do not have any answer
 saat saal pehle bhi aayaa tha stone manrajkot ke itihaas main ye pehla mauka nahin he
 Rather, just seven years before today, an anonymous murderer crushed three people to death one by one and killed them
 ek wo din tha
 And one today
 is pathar maar kaatil kii vaapasi ne logon ko unheen puraane dinon kii yaad dilaa di he
 Experts say that in the same way in the year 2009, three people were crushed to death by stones
 iske baad police ne do logon ko giraftaar kiya tha
 But when these people told the story behind the murder, the policemen were also shocked
 sirf record ke liye katl!saal 2009 main do kaatilon ne sirf record banane ke liye teen logon kaa katl kiya tha
 He wanted to break the record of Mumbai serial killer Raghav Raman's murder
 raghav raman ke bare main kaha jaataa he ki usne apane daur main 55 logon kii jaan lee thi
 However, the murderer of Rajkot seven years ago was acquitted for lack of evidence
 lekin ahm baat ye thi ki donon kii giraftaar ke baad un dinon katl kaa silsilaa ruk gaya tha
 Now once again the same challenge is faced by Rajkot police
 chunauti is nae stone main urf patharmar kaatil urf serial killer ko dabochne kii
 And it is also a coincidence that here Rajkot is afraid of this new serial killer
 udhar, baliwood main apane daur se khaufnak serial killer raghav raman par bhi ek film ban kar takreeban taiyaar he

 tamilnadu main sattadhari dal ol india anna dravid munetra kadgam (AIADMK) ne rajya kii sabhi siton par akele chunaav ladane kaa elaan kiya he
 In fact, after the demise of former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa, the BJP was looking for an alliance in the Lok Sabha elections, taking advantage of the scattered AIADMK weakness
 AIADMK dwaara buudhvaar ko ek vijyapti jari kar loksabhaa chunaav ladane main dilchaspee rakhane vaale netaaon ko 25000 rupee nunatam shulk ke saath 4 farvari se 10 farvari tak aavedan dene ko kaha tha

 In which one section stood with the current Chief Minister EK Palaniswami, the other faction stood with the current Deputy Chief Minister o Panneerselvam
 mana jaataa he ki bijepi kii madhyastata ke baad ye dono kheme ek saath aae or AIADMK ke vighatan kaa khatra tal gaya

 However, the Speaker declared him a rebel and canceled his membership

 Raje's message to his officers was straightforward: Clean the administration

 Particular attention was paid to the defunct anti-corruption Bureau (ACB) and flamboyant officers were sent to it

 This was the first appointment in the police department for Dinesh, who was released last year after spending seven years in jail in Sohrabuddin's alleged fake encounter case
 iske baad se 27 sitambar tak 100 se zyada giraftaaryaan ho chuki hai
 But critics say that most of these arrests have been made in the case of minor offenses

 This led to a perception among the people that ACB is targeting small fish only

 It succeeded in catching a big fish for the first time on 16 September

 55 karod ru
 Accused of taking bribe , which was stopped shortly before by order of the department
 us din dopaher tak rajya bhar se chah anya logon ko bhi giraftaar kiya gaya
 Then Navdeep Singh and Dinesh went to Raje and told that they were going to arrest Ashok Singhvi, Principal Secretary, Mines Department
 sutron ke mutabik, raaje ne jawaab diya ki agar unke paas paryaapt saboot hai to unhen isaki ijaajat he
 Dinesh had convinced them that Singhvi would definitely be declared 'guilty'
 phir duusare sandigdhon se 1
 63 crores Rs

 According to ACB officials, Dinesh was instrumental in the investigation

 He intensified the investigation in july-august when he came to know that six other mines were also going to be closed and then allowed to be reopened

 Had to be transacted
 aakhirkaar jab ek badi khadaan ke liye rishwat ke saude ko anjaam diya gaya to singhvi ko giraftaar kar liya gaya
 Singhvi's lawyers say that no bribe case is made against him, because he was neither caught red-handed nor was he caught with any money
 vahiin pradesh congress pramukh sachin payalat ne daawa kiya ki centre ne singhvi ke khilaaf saboot jutaaye the, taaki raaje unhen bachaa na paaen
 He says, "no IAS officer can do corruption on such a level without the support of the top
" hamane singhvi kii ore se jari aavantnon kii sibiai jaanch kii maang kii he
 However, it may be difficult for the Congress to take political advantage from this alleged mining and licensing business, as the Raje government was following the Gehlot government's policy in mine allocation
 is saal janvari main centre kii ore se adhyadesh jari hone se pehle singhvi 1,400 se zyada khadaanon kaa aavanton aadesh jari kar chuke the
 Raje is now hoping to create a 'clean image' of his government before the 'rajasthan Uday', a series of international investors in November through this anti-corruption campaign
 apane ek varisht adhikari ko raaje kah chuki hai, ''hamen niveshkon ko bataanaa hoga ki vasuuli kaa jamaana chalaa gaya or ve nirbhik hokar kaarobaar kar sakate hai
 Incidentally, this major action was taken during Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat's state visit
 raaje ke liye sangh ko sahi sanket dena jaruri he kyonki lalit prakaran main sangh ne unka saath diya he

 If this is true, then there is another aspect of this incident, before which justice has been done before it comes
 is puure ghatnakram par gaur karen to kai sawaal khadey hote hai
 1
 sabase bada sawaal to ye he ki bheed aaropee tak pahunchi kaise? agar us police afasar kii baat par yakeen kar bhi len to kya schuli chaatraon ke liye jail kaa darwaja tod kar ghusna itnaa aasaan kaam he? kya jail kii suraksha itani kamjor he? dimapur central jail ke suraksha intjaam ardh sainik balon ke hawaale he
 Were school students so capable that they broke through the strong doors of the prison? So broke this security circle with just a few schoolgirls or did they have anti-social elements in the crowd? 2
 bataate hai ki bheed ke paas aaropee kii tasviir thi
 This picture was in the hands of some and on the mobiles of some people
 maan lete hai logon ke paas tasviir thi jisaki madad se unhone aaropee kii pahchaan kii hogi
 But who told them that the accused Syed Sharif Khan is in which cell? If the schoolgirls were walking ahead in the crowd, then how do they know which way is there to reach the cell in which Sharif is kept? 3
 agar suraksha itani majboot nahin thi ki bheed ko roka ja sake to atirikt intjaam kyon nahin kiye gaye? choti choti baton par police saream logon ko peetate dekhi ja sakati he
 Often videos of such an incident can be seen on social media? Then how did the police administration remain so lethargic in the case? Who was the accused? Second-hand car and scrap dealer Syed Sharif Khan, hailing from Karimganj, Assam, was first described as Bangladeshi
 sharif ke bhai jamaluddin khan kaa kahana he ki unka puraa parivaar sena main he

 unke ek or bhai, imamuddin khan bhi sena main tha jo 1999 kii kargil ladaai main shahid ho gaya
 Father Syed Hussain Khan retired from the Indian Air Force
 
 
 
 And politics, Assam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi also suspects that this is not a case of rape
 media main aae unke bayaan to yahi ishaara kar rahe hai
 However, he is particularly concerned about the accused Syed Sharif Khan being a resident of Assam
 is maamle menshivsena ke adhyaksh uddhav thakreka bhi bayaan aayaa he jisamen unhone dimapur kii ghatana ko niyati kaa nyaay qaraar diya he
 In the Sena mouthpiece Saamana, Thackeray says that what could not happen in Delhi happened in Nagaland and people should learn from the people of Nagaland
 aakhri sawaal
 
 
 The natural principle of justice is that even if the culprit is released, no innocent is punished

 Nevertheless he was given the opportunity to go through the judicial process

 But there was no debate in Dimapur, nor justice directly? And what kind of justice when it was not proved that the accused was the culprit
 vaise dimapur kii bheed main koun log the? kya ve mahaj rape ke ek aaropee ko maarna chaahate the yaa khaastaur par us shaks saiyad sharif khan ko, jis par rape kaa aarope tha? is sawaal kaa jawaab milanaa jaruri he
