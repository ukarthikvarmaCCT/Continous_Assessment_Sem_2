 But, here it is not about ordinary citizens but Uttarakhand state born in 2000 as the 27th state
 jo ab kuch hi ghanton ke baad 18wein varsh main pravesh kar jayega or 'balig' bhi ho jayega
 What was lost and what was found in the journey from birth to 17 years, it is just that every citizen who dreamed of 'birth' of this state is engaged in this uproar

 Whether it is a struggle for state formation or after the formation of the state, there is political upheaval, change or disaster of the mountains, but even today the same question arises in the minds of the residents here, how much the fate and picture of the mountain has changed in these 17 years

 Migration became a problem, closed room contemplation, during 18 years, the most serious problem that Uttarakhand is most affected by is migration
 
 
 par 17 varsh bitate-bitate palaayan kii chintaa kin filon main gum ho gai pataa hi nahin chalaa
 Meditation and contemplation continues in closed rooms
 phir chaahe wo congress kii sarkaar rahi ho yaa phir bijepi kii
 Recently, Uttarakhand government had to call out the guests who have migrated from Uttarakhand long ago and those who have left their homes for a serious issue like migration to a plush hall in the state's Chief Minister's residence in Dehradun

 This person, who has been a four-time MP, once used to speak in eastern Bihar
 bahubali rajesh ranjan urf pappu yadav ab puri tarah se badale hue insaan najar aate hai
 He is pursuing his MA in Sociology from Nalanda Open University and is the only inmate to take his MA examination from Beur Jail in 2012
 pappu yadav kii in dinon pratham varsh kii pariksha chal rahi he
 They are taking exams from their cell in jail itself
 pariksha dete samay, ek invigilator kii maujuudagi main pappu yadav uttar pustika ke saare panne bharne kii ji-tod koshish karte hai
 When Pappu represented Purnia and Madhepura seats four times in the Lok Sabha, he used to pass only intermediate
 baad main, tihaad jail main rahete hue unhone maanav adhikaar or aapadaa prabandhan main degree hasil kii
 Now his dream is to do phd later
 agast, 2010 main jamaanat radd hone or phir gudgaanv ke ek aspataal se giraftaar kiye jane ke baad se yah 46 varshiya bahubali patna kii beur central jail main band he
 Pappu Yadav was sentenced to life imprisonment in February 2008 for plotting the murder of CPI-M MLA Ajit Sarkar in June 1998
 is sajaa ke chalate ve chunaav ladane ke adhikaar se pehle hi vanchit ho chuke hai
 Pappu Yadav, first arrested in May 1999, has spent more than a decade behind bars
 ab aisa lagata he ki unki antaratma kii aawaaj us pappu yadav par haaavee ho chuki he, jo ek daur main bekhauf or betaj badshaah hua karata tha
 Pappu Yadav is writing his autobiography, whose title is yet to be decided
 jisane bhi unhen diary likhte hue dekha he, uskaa yahi kahana he ki yah aatmakatha kaaphi baari-bharkam hogi
 The question is, when did Pappu realize that his pen was more powerful than his sword? One of his colleagues in jail says, "writing an autobiography is to regain his reputation because Pappu thinks that now he has only his Due to writing and educational qualifications one can get respect in the society
 '' beur jail main sajaa kaat rahe pappu adhyayan, paroapkaar, web stambh lekhan or kai anya sakaaratmak chizon main shaamil hai, jo aam taur par unki pahchaan nahin rahi hai
 He first became an independent MLA in 1990 at the age of 25
 june, 2011 main jab patna police ne beur central jail pahunch kar pappu yadav kii kothri par achaanak chapa maaraa tha, to yah purv saansad kuch likhata hua mila tha
 This was a very unusual thing for a person with Pappu Yadav's image and even while he is in jail
 ho saktaa he pappu yadav ko apni lekhan style main kuch sudhaar karne kii jarurat ho lekin vah apni chhavi ke saath chaspaan daag ko chhudaane kii purajor koshishon main lage hai or apni aatmakatha kaa ek-chauthai hissaa pehle hi khatm kar chuke hai
 His previous journey in jails was different
 sitambar 2004 main, pappu ne apni jamaanat kaa jashn manaane ke liye beur jail main kaidiyon ko ek bhavy party di thi
 In the same year, he had called some 670 times from jails and some of these numbers were also from Bihar ministers
 disambar, 2004 main pappu jail main samarthakon kaa darbar lagaate hue pakade gaye the, jis par supreme court ne unhen dilli kii tihaad jail bhejne kaa aadesh diya tha
 So far, his presence in Beur Jail has not been particularly eventful
 khud ko apane ateet se baahar laane kii pappu kii is kavayad ne unhen dusron kii bhalaai karne ke liye bhi prerit kiya he
 Last year, activists of her organization Yuva Shakti paid Rs 6 lakh for the transplant of a talented singer Anshumala for a kidney
 jutaaye the
 Anshumala was abandoned by her in-laws
 musiibat main fanse logon kii madad karne ke pappu yadav ke kai udaahranon main se yah sirf ek he
 Apart from the contributions of activists, Pappu's former MP wife Ranjitha Ranjan and five sisters continue to spend their resources to fulfill their wishes to do well for others
 pappu or unki patni ne kuch skool or vyavsaayik prashikshan centre bhi sthapit kiye hai, jahaan garibon ko riyayati daron par shiksha milti he
 Pappu studies all the newspapers that are asked for in the library of Beur Jail
 ve garibon ke halaat bayaan karne vaale samaacharon ke nots banaate hai
 Every week, the personal courier delivers these Sifarshi notes to Ranjita Ranjan
 pappu ne patni ko jail aane kii manaahi kar rakhi he
 This is obviously a big change for the man who used to be a dangerous don in the past
 pappu ke naam kaa ek samay bihar main baari dabadabaa tha
 In the nineties, when the image of criminal to leader was skyrocketed, Pappu Yadav was showing great bullying easily and bending people towards his will
 is ateet kii ekmaatr khaas baat unka khud ko robinhood kii chhavi main dhaalnaa tha
 Due to his dominance, Pappu was successful in forcing the administration to adopt populist policies
 un dinon unke nirvachan kshetra main shaayad hi kabhi bijli katautee hui ho
 In his heyday, Pappu used to get doctors to treat the poor for free, with corrupt bureaucrats trembling with their fear
 ve un khantee jatigat mathadhishon ke liye bhi ek maanak the, jinhen bihar ke khandit samaaj ne raajnneeti ke centre par pahunchaa diya tha
 It was often his final decision on issues related to his constituency
 sipii-em ke vidhayak ajit sarkaar kii hatya ke silsile main may, 1999 main giraftaar kiye jane ke baad se pappu lagbhag jail main hi rahe hai
 He was granted bail thrice and the Supreme Court canceled it thrice and sent him back to jail
 sipii-em ke chaar baar vidhayak rahe sarkaar kaa purniya main acha-khaasaa janaadhar tha, pappu yadav ko bhi rajnatik khyaati kii bulandiyon tak le jane vaala purniya hi tha
 The CBI charge sheet filed in a special court said that Ajit Sarkar was eliminated because he ensured Pappu Yadav's election defeat in the 1998 Lok Sabha elections
 pappu ko sajaa sibiai kii isi chargeshit ne dilwaai thi
 However, Pappu has appealed against this punishment
 pappu kaa kharaab samay farvari 2008 main tab shuru hua, jab sibiai kii vishesh adaalat ne unhen umrakaid kii sajaa sunai
 The friends of fun days left Pappu
 jald hi, vah gahare aatmamanthan kii haalat main pahunch gaye or unhen ehsaas ho gaya ki unke jivan main sudhaar kii sakht jarurat he
 Pappu claims that the more sins he has committed, the more sins he has committed against him; But now they hardly have any complaint against anyone
 jail main apane lambey daur main pappu baahar se vinamr or mridubhashi bane rahe
 This is the quality that has been with them since their time
 lekin is saare aatmamanthan ke baavjood kuch baton ne ab bhi pappu yadav kaa peechha nahin choda he
 Black shadows of the past still haunt her
 jinke chalate ve baichaiyn rahete hai or neend na aane kii beemaari se grast ho chuke hai
 They hardly sleep more than four hours a day
 pichley do saal se ve beur jail main hai or itnaa hi samay unhen apane bade hote bacchon se mili hue ho gaya he
 They do not want their children to see them in jail
 unki chah saal kii beti ko yah tak nahin pataa ki ve jail main hai
 Pappu says this much, "may God never show this day even to the enemy"

 iske baad aage kii katof jari karne ke bare main faisla kiya jayega
 Not taking the name of ending the bad phase for Asaram, now the administration's eyes are also curtailed at Haridwar Ashram
 haridwar vikaas praadhikaran ne haridwar sthit asaram ke ashram ko avaidh nirmaan ko lekar notice jari kar diya he
 The authority has also issued notice to the multi-storeyed apartments built in the name of Asaram in Haridwar itself
 praadhikaran ne chetavanee di he ki yadi ashram kii or se santoshjanak jawaab nahin miltaa he to ashram or apartments donon ko giraane kii karwai kii jaaegi
 On the other hand, the operators of Asaram's ashram have also occupied several bigha land of Rajaji Park adjacent to their ashram
 haridwar main bhi asaram jameenon par avaidh kabjon or avaidh nirmaan ke maamalon main ghirte najar aa rahe hai
 Baba in the ashram located at Haripurkalaan in Haridwar, without any permission from Haridwar Development Authority, made a huge illegal construction
 haridwar kaa ye puraa ashram hi bina anumati ke bana diya gaya
 As long as Asaram's status was there, the administration did not see illegal construction anywhere, but now Asaram's troubles increased, Haridwar Development Authority also remembered to take action
 haridwar vikaas praadhikaran ke upaadhyaksh ranjit sinha ne kaha ki unke ashram ke bare main bataa diya gaya tha, uskaa map sweekrut nahin he
 When he was created, his land use was also agricultural
 bina lang yuj change kiye unhone ashram kaa nirmaan kiya he
 If it is not compoundable, then the process of demolishing the construction will be done as per rules
 yahi nahin haridwar main asaram ke naam par hi ek bahumanjila apartment bhi bana kar khadaa kar diya gaya
 Permission was not obtained from the authority to construct this apartment as well
 ab praadhikaran ne is apartment ke avaidh nirmaan par bhi sakht ravaiya apanaate hue notice jari kar nirmaankartaaon se jabaab maanga he
 Ranjit Sinha says it has an ashram of Asaram
 unheen ke logon dwaara ek apartment bhi banaaya gaya
 Neither of the two maps is nearby

 The Rajaji Park administration is still blind in this matter
 isko lekar yanha ke gramin acroshit hai or unka kahana he ki yah gambhir masalaa he or is par jaanch honi chahie
 Ashram, who occupied Gundagardi in Rishikesh, may be caught in Haridwar in case of illegal possession of the ashram, but in Rishikesh, Asaram is accused of illegally occupying the ashram of a saint on the strength of Gundagardi
 balpurvak kabja karne ke aaropon ko lekar rishikesh ke hanuman vatika main sthit asaram kaa ashram bhi vivaad main he

 is sambandh main jab police main report karai gayi to vahaan bhi asaram ke aage ashram ke vaastavik sanchaalak manhat harisevak das kii ek naa chali
 It is alleged that the goons of Asaram broke the idol of Guru Tyagi Laxman Das of Harisevak about 5 years ago and threw it into the Ganges
 aarope he ki ashram ke hi ek manhat lakshmana das kii jehar dekar hatya kar di gayi
 In 2007, the ashram was forcibly captured by the goons of Asaram along with the policemen of Uttar Pradesh
 ashram main jamkar in logon ne lutpaat kii or ashram ke dastavej jala die
 Sage Harisevak Das, the victim of Rishikesh, says the ashram is ours

 — taran adarsh (@taran_adarsh)june 16, 2018 Delhi Congress President Ajay Maken has targeted the BJP at the Center and the Aam Aadmi Party of Delhi (AAP) over the rising prices of petrol and diesel
 unhone petrol or dijal kii aasmaan chhuti keemton ke liye bijepi or AAP ko jimmedaar tehraaya he
 Delhi Congress President Ajay Maken said that when BJP and Aam Aadmi Party governments have to take care of each other's interests, the two join hands
 unhone kaha ki donon hi partiyaan petrol-dijal ke bade hue daamon ke liye jimmedaar hai
 Ajay Maken said that if the excise duty on petrol and diesel was increased nine times by the central government of BJP and VAT was increased twice by the Aam Aadmi Party's Delhi government, the price of petrol and diesel in the national capital Delhi would be 40
 -45 per liter
 unhone kaha ki petrol or dijal kii keemten badhaakar piem modi apane doston dwaara chalaai ja rahi rifinary ko sidhe laabh pahunchaana chaahate hai
 The pockets of Modi's friends are being filled with the earning of blood and sweat of the people of the country
 maakan ne kaha ki dilli vailu aded tex main duusare sanshodhan ko lekar aap party dwaara dilli vidhansabha main 30 june 2015 ko bill paas hua tha, jisko dilli ke up rajyapal ne 10 july 2015 ko apni manjuuri bhi de di thi yani 10 dinon main is sanshodhan ko manjuuri bhi mil gai thi
 He said that in the fourth schedule of this amendment, the rate of VAT on petroleum products was increased from 20 percent to 30 percent
 aam aadmi party or bijepi donon kii mileebhagat se dilli main tel kii keemton par waite kii daren badhaai gayi, jiske kaaran bhi petrol or dijal ke daam bade hai
 This is not the first time Ajay Maken has attacked the Aam Aadmi Party of Delhi and the BJP government at the Center
 isse pehle wo petrol or dijal ke bade daamon ko lekar modi sarkaar ke khilaaf cycle raily bhi nikaal chuke hai
 Congress leaders, councilors and activists took part in this rally in large numbers
 is dauraan modi sarkaar ke khilaaf jamkar narebaaji kii gai thi
 However, despite all the opposition from Congress, petrol and diesel prices are not being named yet
 haalanki modi sarkaar jald hi raahat dene kii baat kah rahi he
 SC-ST Act will not be misused in MP, it will not be arrested without investigation
 dengue chikangunia ke is mausam main dawaaiyon kii kami, aspataalon main jagah na hone or mantriyon-netaaon ke dilli se baahar daure kii khabaren to aapane khub padhin lekin iskaa doosraa pahalu bhi he
 Let me tell you about some doctors who are ill themselves but have sidelined their disease to cure the sick
 makasad sirf ek ki marijon ko raahat kaise pahunchaaen
 Babu Jagjivan Ram Hospital's HOD Doctor Avinash is busy caring for the patients, regardless of duty hours
 apni tamaam pareshaaniyaan bhuulakar
 Dr
 avinaash ko khud bhi bukhaar he lekin dawaai lekar apane peshents ko bukhaar se durust karne ke liye duty owers kii bhi parvaah nahin karte
 The big thing is that like private doctors, the season of dengue-malaria-chikungunya is not the earning season for government doctors like these, for them, there is only one motivation to fix your patient
 dow avinaash kaa kahana he ki 'privet aspataalon ke kai ofer aae, aate bhi rahete hai, lekin yahaan rahakar un logon, jo sansadhano ke abhaav main yahaan aate hai, kii seva karne main jo santosh he wo kahin or nahin
 We are doing our duty
 'sarkaar ke aadesh se pehle hi cancil thim chhuttiyambabu jagjivan ram aspataal ke dipti emsdoctorsies bhogal ne bataaya ki chhuttiyaan cancil karne kaa aadesh to dilli sarkaar ne ek din pehle hi bheja he lekin uske pehle se hi tamaam staff apni chhuttiyaan cancil kar marijon kii timaardaari main laga he
 Let me tell you that apart from doctors, all the paramedical staff holidays have also been canceled by the Delhi government till further orders
 dilli ke tamaamsarkari aspatalonka bura haal he or ek-ek bed par do-do marijon ko jagah dene jaisi sthiti bani hui he
 The special thing is that in this situation of medical disaster, such doctors are standing with Delhi who do not understand their suffering in front of the suffering of the patients

 bhartiya captain mahendra singh dhoni ne sweekaar kiya he ki videshi dharti par lagaataar paanchavin haar se unki team kaa aatmavishvaas thodaa dagamagaa jarur gaya he, lekin ve hataash nahin hai
 He said that Team India is ready to make a strong comeback in the second Test against Australia in Sydney starting on Tuesday
 england main pichley saal garmiyon main 0-4 se sharmnaak haar jhelane ke baad bharat ko australia ke haathon melbern main pehle test match main bhi 122 ran se haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 Dhoni said on the eve of the Sydney match, it has affected (confidence) a bit, but we are not broken, because we all know what really happened and you learn from mistakes
 ham sakaaratmak pahaluon par dhyaan de rahe hai
 In the last five matches we lost on foreign soil, there were many positive things for us
 unhone kaha, hamen keval ballebaaji or gendbaaji main sudhaar ke bajaay ikai ke taur par sudhaar karne kii jarurat he
 Like England, we do not have to deal with injuries here, which is a positive aspect for us
 australian team hamaari ballebaaji line-ap par dabaav banaae rakhane kii koshish karegi or yahi baat gendbaajon par bhi lagu hoti he
 When Dhoni was asked if Sachin Tendulkar's much-awaited 100th international century was diverting the team's attention, he said, "this has created media attention, which is good for us
" ham jahaan bhi jate hai, log isi ke bare main baat karte hai
 As a team, they want to achieve it as soon as possible
 sachai yahi he ki yah bahut badi uplabdhi he or ham iskaa hissaa bananaa or iskaa lutf uthaanaa chahenge
 The Indian captain said that Sachin can achieve this feat at any time and it does not appear that he is affected in any way due to the delay
 dhoni ne kaha, ham sabhi jaanate hai ki yah shatak jarur lagegaa
 This can happen in this Test match or in the next match or this series
 aap ise hone se roak nahin sakate
 i don't think he is thinking much about it
 unhone kaha, nishchit taur par vah jitani jaldi ise hasil karenge, un par se tathakthith dabaav kam hoga, kyonki dabaav asafalataa or pradarshan kaa hota he
 There may be pressure of performance, but he does not really talk about it and never feels that he is under pressure of 100th century
 dhoni ne kaha ki toss jeetne kii dasha main ballebaaji yaa gendbaaji karne kaa faisla match se pehle pich ko dekhakar hi karenge
 "it will depend on what the wicket looks like before the match," he said
 yadi wicket par nami rahati he or aasmaan main badal rahete hai or lagata he ki pehle satr ke baad bhi aisi sthiti rahegi to ham gendbaaji kaa faisla karenge, lekin faisla karne se pehle ham subah kaa wicket dekhnaa chahenge
 He said, there are signs of green grass on the wicket
 shuru main isse tej gendbaajon ko madad mil sakati he
 After that it will be favorable for batting
 main pakke taur par nahin kah saktaa, lekin baad main isse turn mil saktaa he, lekin yah is par nirbhar karegaa ki wicket par kitna roller chalaaya jaataa he
 Dhoni said that India has also made strategies for Australian batsmen
 aisa hi daawa australian captain maaikel clark ne bhartiya ballebaajon ke liye kiya tha
 Dhoni was also asked if he was missing Harbhajan Singh
 unase slip main surakshit maane jane vaale rahul dravid ke kaich chhodane ke bare main bhi sawaal kiya gaya
 The Indian captain said, "we are happy with his (dravid's) performance
" vah hamaare sarvshereshth kachar main se ek he
 In cricket, you sometimes miss a few catches, but if you consistently do well, then there should be no reason to keep you out of slip
 bharat ke liye chathe number kaa sthaan kaaphi pareshaani vaala rahaa he tathaa dhoni ko viraat kohli or rohit sharma main se kisi ek kaa chayan is number ke liye karnaa hoga
 He said, he is a good batsman and he has prepared well
 use lay hasil karne kii jarurat he, isliye kuch bhi galat nahin he
 Hopefully he runs
 dhoni ne mana ki unke ballebaajon ko shuru main 15 se 20 over tak baahar jaati gendon kaa chhodana hoga
 He said, Kookaburra ball can give a lot of guts in the initial 15 to 20 overs, so dropping the balls that go out of the off stump can help, but you cannot say that to Virender Sehwag, who needs to be blown away by such balls
 It's fun
 dhoni ne kaha, lekin salaami ballebaaj ke liye gend chhodana hameshaa acha rahata he or hamen is par kaam karnaa hoga, lekin main phir kahuunga ki aap nahin chaahoge ki sahvaag bahut adhik gend chode, jo cat shot par kaaphi nirbhar he
 Opening is important to us and we want them to score big

 The Unlawful Activities (prevention) Amendment Bill 2019 introduced by Home Minister Amit Shah in the second term of Narendra Modi government has passed from Lok Sabha
 ab ise rajyasabha main charchaa ke liye bheja jayega
 After passing from here, in the event of law being made, the terrorists will be able to rein in more, as well as the strength of NIA will also increase
 loksabhaa main buudhvaar ko vidhi-viruddh kriyalap (nivaaran) sanshodhan vidheyak unlawful activities prevention amendment act (UAPA) ko voting ke baad paas kar diya gaya
 There were 287 votes in favor of this bill and only 8 votes in opposition
 bill ke paksh me bolte hue grih mantri amit shah ne kaha ki hamen aatank ke khilaaf kade kanoon kii jarurat he
 On the other hand, Congress MP Adhir Ranjan Chaudhary demanded that the UAPA Bill be referred to the Standing Committee, while AIMIM MP Asaduddin Owaisi said that the Bill gives the right to violate constitutional rights, declare anyone suspicious or terrorists can not be done
 haalanki biju janata dal ne is bill kaa samarthan kiya
 Where the government stands with the UAPA bill, Owaisi is strongly opposed to it
 aakhir yuapie main wo koun se ahm praavdhaan kiye ja rahe hai, jiskaa vipaksh virodh kar rahaa he
 And the rules will be tightened Amit Shah introduced the UAPA bill in Lok Sabha on 8 July
 bill ke jariye badhate aatankwaad par lagaam kasne kii yah kavayad mana ja rahaa he
 Under the UAPA bill, the central government can declare any organization a terrorist organization if it is found to be involved in any of the following 4
 1
 In any case related to terror, his involvement or any kind of commitment is found
 2
 Preparation of terrorism 3
 aatankwaad ko badhaava dena4
 Apart from any other kind of involvement in terrorist activities, this bill also gives the government the right to declare anyone as a terrorist on the basis of it
 enie kii takat badhegividheyak rashtriya jaanch agency (NIA) ko bhi aseemit adhikaar detaa he
 Till now, according to the rule, an investigating officer had to get permission from the Director General of Police (DGP) to seize property in any terrorism related case, but now this bill allows that if any case related to terrorism If an officer of the NIA is investigated, he will only have to get permission from the Director General of NIA for this
 nae prastaavit sanshodhano ke baad ab enie ke mahanideshak ko aisi sampattiyon ko kabje main lene or unki kurki karne kaa adhikaar mil jayega jinka aatanki gatividhiyon main istemaal kiya gaya
 Now for this, the NIA will not have to take permission from the Director General of Police of the state
 inspector bhi kar sakegaa jaanchajaanch ke sambandh main bhi enie (NIA) ke paas ab takat or bad gai he
 According to the rule so far, any such case could be investigated by an officer of the rank of Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) or Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP)
 lekin ab nae niyam ke mutabik enie ke afasaron ko zyada adhikaar die gaye hai
 Now any such case can be investigated by the rank of Inspector or above
 grih mantri amit shah ne sanshodhan bill kaa samarthan karte hue kaha ki aatankwaad par karaara prahaar karne ke liye kade or behad kade kanoon kii jarurat he
 Today the Congress is opposing the amendment in the law, whereas in 1967 it was Indira Gandhi's government that brought this law
 yuapie main nae badlaav ke tahat enie ke paas aseemit adhikaar aa jaaenge
 It will be able to raise people on the basis of suspicion in terrorist activities, as well as declare organizations as terrorist organizations and take action on them
 saath hi jaanch ke liye enie ko pehle sambandhit rajya kii police se anumati lenaa padati thi, lekin ab isaki jarurat nahin padegi, aise main dharpakad bad sakati he or vipaksh ko dar he ki isse enie kii manamaani bad jaaegi or alpsankhyak samudaay ke logon ko dikkaton kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he
 The Pakistan government, its security agencies, ISI, the biggest mastermind of the terrorist conspiracy in India, is bent on calling a person named Sub Kulbhushan Jadhav a spy of India, while the reality is different
 pakistani sena or sarkaar ne ek din pehle press conference kii or is shaks ko ro kaa agent bataate hae kaboolname kaa video jari kiya, lekin 'aaj tak' kii padtaal se pakistan ke safed jhuuthon kii paraten khul gayi
 Pakistan's first lie - the first and biggest lie Pakistan has spoken about the arrest of Nakul Bhushan
 baluchistan ke grih mantri sarfaraj bugti kaa daawa he ki kulbhushan ko chaman se giraftaar kiya gaya, jabaki pakistani army kaa daawa he ki use saravan se giraftaar kiya
 Chaman borders Iran, Pakistan, and Afghanistan, while Saravanan in Iran
 donon shaharon ke bich faasla bhi chota-motaa nahin balki 873 kilometre kaa he
 The question is, if Kulbhushan was arrested, from where? There are two types of statements on the arrest that there is some black in the lentils
 giraftaar ke do lokation bataae gaye or donon main saikadon kilometre kaa fark he
 In the same way as the arrest is in Patna and it is said that the arrest has been made in Delhi
 pakistan kaa doosraa jhooth-video ko gaur se dekhen to saaf pataa chalata he ki is video ke saath chhedchhad hui he
 It is not difficult to understand how easy it is to force someone to confess anything to them if they are under arrest

 Even on the date of the arrest of Kulbhushan Jadhav, the whole falsehood of Pakistan's lies was revealed
 pakistan kaa daawaahe ki kulbhushan ko 3 march ko giraftaar kiya to phir pakistan ko is sawaal kaa bhi jawaab dena hoga ki aakhir uski giraftaar kaa khulaasa 24 march ko kyon kiya? teen hafte kulbhushan kii giraftaar par chuppi kii kundali maare kyon baitha rahaa?pakistan kaa chauthaa jhooth-pakistan kaa yah bhi daawa he ki bluechistan or karachi main kulbhushan kisi satyaprakash naam ke shaks ke sampark main tha, lekin suraksha agenciyaan uske bare main puri jaankaree dene se anakani kyon kar rahi he?pakistan kaa paanchvaan jhooth-pakistan kii badaniyati or farebi fitrat kaa isse bada saboot kya ho saktaa he ki bhartiya duutavas ke adhikariyon ko kulbhushan se milane nahin diya ja rahaa he
 It is clear that Pakistan is defaming India and does not want to let the truth come out

 The story of 45-year-old Rajendra Singh Rajput, an RTI activist from Bhopal in Madhya Pradesh proved to be similar
 unhone artiai ke jariye farji anusuchit jati pramaan patr banavaa sarkari naukari kar rahe adhikariyon kaa khulaasa kya kiya, unki museebataan bad gayi
 The officers allegedly harassed him so much that he committed suicide on October 15 in front of the office of the Chief Secretary of the state, Antony Diesa
 maamle kii shuruyaat saal 2006 main hui jab rajendra ne kathith taur par farji jati pramaan patr par sarkari naukari kar rahe kareeb 300 logon kii jaankaree artiai ke tahat nikalwai thi
 In RTI, he found that all of them are doing government jobs, claiming that they belong to Od Beldar caste
 lekin kathith taur par inamen se zyaadaatar od rajput jati ke hai
 Odd Rajput caste belongs to OBC in the state while Od Beldar caste belongs to Scheduled Caste
 rajendra khud isi od rajput jati ke hai
 The officials whose names were received from RTI had allegedly got fake SC certificates and are taking advantage of the SC quota in every way
 hycourt main bhi isaki shikaayat karte hue unhone 2009 main ek yachika daayar kii thi
 Rajendra also complained to the top officials of the government and presented the necessary evidence for this
 lekin shivaraj singh chouhan sarkaar or unke prashasnic adhikariyon ne is par koi dhyaan nahin diya
 Instead of taking action against those officers, Rajendra's troubles increased
 unhen dhamkiyaan milane lageen or marpet kii gai
 Out of those who allegedly got jobs through fake certificates, 33 officers started threatening them

 unki(rajendra kii) jaan ko khatra tha or is bare main kai baar adhikariyon ko bataaya gaya tha
 But no action was taken

 Rajni blames the government's indifferent attitude for her death
 ve kahati hai, ''shashan farji jati pramaan patr ke aadhaar par naukari kar rahe logon ke khilaaf samay rahete karrwai kar letaa to mere pati ko aatmahatya nahin kerani padati
 "the officers rescued the culprits and because of this, my husband consumed the poison in front of the room of the Chief Secretary in the Ministry of State
 ''rajendra ne marane se pehle 23 pej kaa ek suicide note likhaa he
 In it, he mentions the names of the officers who were constantly harassing him
 ve mukhya sachiv ko ek aavedan dene gaye the, jo unke paas se baraamad hua he
 In this application, Rajendra has told those responsible for suicide against whom he had filed a petition in the High Court in 2009
 police ne jaankaree di ki is aavedan main rajendra ne likhaa he ki yachika daayar karne ke baad se hi unhen or unke parivaar ko lagaataar jhuthe maamalon main fansaane kii dhamkee di ja rahi he
 City Superintendent of Police (CSP) Salim Khan, who arrived on the spot after consuming Rajendra's poison, said, "before Rajendra's death, every effort was made to record his statement, but he was not in a position to make a statement
" is vajah se bayaan darj nahin kiya ja sakaa
 "IG Sanjay Kumar Jha has formed a four-member Special Investigation Team which is investigating the matter
" police un sabhi adhikariyon se poochtacha kar rahi he jinka naam rajendra ne apane patr main liya he
 Some officers are posted outside the state, they are also being questioned

 The police have not made all those 33 accused
 uskaa kahana he ki jaanch main jaise-jaise naam saamne aaenge, unke khilaaf mukadmaa darj kiya jayega

 Nirmala Sitharaman made this statement on the allegations made by former PM Manmohan Singh in which he said that the government always tries to blame its rivals instead of finding a solution

 lekin agar aap neerav modi ke maamle ko dekhen to vah bhaag gaya, lekin sarkaar dusron par hi aarope madh rahi he

 BJP Vice President and former Information and Broadcasting Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi has sent a financial assistance of Rs 1 lakh for the treatment of noted film and theater artist AK Hangal and has demanded the entire cost of treatment from the Maharashtra government
 nakvi ne yahaan jari ek press vijyapti main kaha ki puure jivan apni kala se logon ke dilon par raaj karne vaala kalakaar jivan ke kamjor lamhon main aarthik tangi ke chalate apana ilaaj bhi nahin kara paa rahaa he
 The BJP vice president has demanded from the Prime Minister that a central fund should be set up with the aim of assisting artists photographers and technicians in such difficult times
 deshbhar main gathbandhanon kaa daur chal rahaa he
 To get to the top of power, the NDA and UPA are putting all their strength, as well as regional parties are trying their own bets
 zyaadaatar rajyon main partiyon kii bich hone vaale gathbandhan par muhar lag chuki he or unke bich siton kaa bantwaaraa bhi ho chukaa he, lekin bihar main upie ke ghatak dalon ke bich seat bantwaare ko lekar uhapoh kii sthiti bani hui he
 'as long as the potatoes in the samosas will remain in Lalu in Bihar', the slogan of the nineties began to fade with the results of the 2009 and 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 agar sirf 2014 ke aankadon ko hi aadhaar maane to 2019 main endie gathbandhan ek baar phir upie gathbandhan par baari padataa najar aa rahaa he
 In addition to BJP and LJP in the current NDA, Nitish Kumar's JD (U), based on the vote received in 2014, seems to go much further than UPA
 2014 loksabhaa chunaav main mili vot ke aadhaar par bihar kii vartmaan endie (bijepi+algepi+jad(you) or upie (congress+argedy+ left+rlsp+ensipi) kaa vot pratishtaunote: All figures are in percent; Data source: ECI_2014; Left: CPI+CPI (M) +CPI (ML)2014 ke chunaav main jahaan muqabla trikoniya tha, is baar halaat badale-badale se hai
 Last time, JDU, BJP and RJD alliance contested separately
 iskaa sidhaa phayda bijepi ko mila, modi lahar main bijepi ne algepi or araspi ke saath milakar 40 main se 31 siten jeet lee thim
 This time too, the NDA is benefiting the most by coming with the JDU, but it is important to mention here that even before the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Nitish Kumar had opposed Narendra Modi's name for the post of Prime Minister and shunned the NDA
 And BJP contested in the name of Nitish protests
 agar 2014 ke aankadon ke aadhaar par aankalan karen or maujuuda gathbandhan ke voton ko jod den to 2019 main endie gathbandhan bijepi kii 22 main se 21, algepi kii chah or jediu kii do siten bachaa saktaa he balki lalu yadav kii argedy (rashtriya janata dal) kii jiti arriya, baankaa, bhagalpur or madhepura siton par bhi khatra ban sakate hai
 In 2014, RJD won only 4 of these 40 seats
 2014 main janata dal united ne akele chunaav ladate hue do siton par jeet darj kii thi, jabaki chaar siton par wo duusare number par or 29 siton par tisare paaydaan par rahi
 With the JDU joining the NDA, one of the two Supaul seats in Congress and Upendra Kushwaha's rksp's Karakat seat can also be fielded by the NDA
 2014 kii loksabhaa main araspi ne do siten jiti thim
 The Data Intelligence Unit (DIU) of India Today examined the votes cast in the last elections on 40 seats in Bihar
 hamane aankadon ko nae gathbandhan ke sameekaran ke hisaab se vot sheyaron main sambhavit badlaav ko aadhaar banaaya he
 After this investigation, it can be inferred that the coming of JDU is going to give a lot of strength to the NDA alliance in Bihar
 haalanki agar mahagathbandhan main communist partiyaan yaa bispi shaamil hoti he to kuch siton par ulatpher dikh saktaa he
 In terms of votes, there can be a slight change in two seats due to Jitan Manjhi's new party 'hum' and Upendra Kushwaha's party in the grand alliance
 in sab samikarnon ke baavjood agar nitish kumaar or bijepi ek-duusare ko apane vot transfar karwaane main kaamyaab rahe to endie ko 40 main se 35 siton par kamyaabi mil sakati he, haalanki inamen se das siton par maamla kaaphi najdiki he
 Ethnic equations and selection of candidates can also play a big role here
 algepi kii maujuuda seat samastipur, jediu kii nalanda or bijepi kii begusarai, madhubani, saaran, jhanjharpur, sasaram, aurangabad, khagadiya or ujiyarpur seat par kade mukaable ke asaar hai
 However, the party can get a direct advantage with JDU in seats like Bhagalpur, Darbhanga, Gaya, Gopalganj, Hajipur, Jamui and Jhanjharpur where the bjp's margin of victory was less
 ye bhi sach he ki nitish kumaar ke saath anti inakambency kaa factor bhi judaa he
 BJP may have advantages as well as losses with Nitish Kumar
 bihar ke chunaav kii sabase khaas baat he ki pichley chunaavon main jeet hasil karne vaali takreeban sabhi partiyaan chaahe wo bijepi ho, argedy, janata dal united yaa congress, sabhi kaa vot share 30 fisadi se zyada tha
 The BJP had contested the elections with Ram Vilas Paswan's LJP, winning 22 seats, while the LJP won 7 while contesting 7 seats
 argedy 27 siton par duusare number par thi, lekin jediu jo 2014 kaa chunaav akele ladi thi wo keval 2 seat jeet pai thi
 Every election is different and every election is different
 aaj argedy supremeo chaara ghotaale main ranchi kii jail or aspataalon main sajaa kaat rahe hai, kaman bete tejasvi ke haath main he
 Tejashwi and Congress President Rahul Gandhi are supporting each other, but the seat-sharing has not been found till the news is written
 donon netaaon ne pradhanmantri modi or siem nitish kumaar ke khilaaf morcha khol rakhaa he or upachunaav main jeet se unke hausale bhi bade hue hai
 The biggest challenge for the BJP is to save Buxar seat of Bihar adjoining Uttar Pradesh
 jahaan lalu yadav kii rashtriya janata dal pichley chunaavon main duusare number par thi or vot share main kareeb chaudaa fisadi kaa antar tha, lekin tisare number par bispi kaa ummidavaar tha jiskaa vot share bees fisadi tha, yani argedy se thodaa sa kam
 If the BSP forms an alliance with the RJD, it may be difficult for the BJP to save this seat
 baxur ke alaava jahanabad, katihaar, kishanganj, sitamarhi jaisi siten upie ke khate main bani rah sakati hai
 Two of these five seats - Jehanabad and Sitamarhi Upendra Kushwaha's party are with RLSP
 araspi ne 2014 kaa chunaav endie ke saath milakar ladaa tha
 Now Upendra Kushwaha is included in the grand alliance led by Lalu Yadav
 ye bhi sach he ki 2014 main endie main aane se pehle upendra kushvaha ek kshetreey netaa jinaki koi khaas pahchaan nahin thi, lekin modi lahar par savaar hokar wo na sirf sansad pahunche balki unhen kendriya mantri banaaya gaya or mantri ke taur par unki acchhee khaasi pahchaan ban gai
 Now Kushwaha is against Modi and there is a challenge before him that he can keep his vote bank intact
 endie ke teenon pramukh dalon ne 2019 ke liye ummidavaaron ke naam ghoshit kar die hai
 BJP and Janata Dal United will contest 17-17 seats while Paswan's party will contest 6 seats
 bihar main kul saat charnon main chunaav hone ja rahe hai
 In the first phase, votes will be cast on 11 April and in the final phase on 19 May

 team india ke captandhoni ne murali vijay kii jagahrohit sharmaako jagah diya he jabaki abhyaas maichon main shandaar pradarshan ke liye dinesh karthik bhi team main shaamil kiye gaye hai
 Team India has won both of their warm-up matches and due to this, their pan is considered heavy
 team ne pehle warsop match main bade score kaa peechha kar srilanka ko patkhni di, to duusare match main australia ke khilaaf shuruaati jhatkon ke baavjood bada score banaaya or phir kangaaroon ko behad kam main samet diya
 On the other hand, Africa's team has lost in practice matches, their concern is also increased by the injury of star bowler Dale Steyn
 abhi tak sten kaa khelnaa nishchit nahin he
 Whom to choose Dhoni, Raina or rohitmatch Before the start, all the discussion is on what will be the team combination of captain Dhoni
 dhoni ne baar baar kaha he ki england ke halaat dekhte hue paanch bowler khilaae jane tay hai
 Three of them will be Bhuvaneshwar Kumar, Umesh Yadav and Ishant Sharma
 spinner ke taur par aar aswin or amit mishra donon jabardast form main hai, magar dhoni aswin par hi daanv lagaayenge
 Dhoni's favorite IPL Met Sir Ravindra Jadeja will act as the fifth bowler
 unke shaamil hone ko lekar olerounder factor vaala tark he
 Now talk about batting order
 dhoni specialist par bahut jor dete hai or aise main sambhaavna he ki murali vijay or shikhar dhawan hi pari kii shuruyaat karen

 In such a situation, only one place left after Dhoni, whose contenders are two, Raina and Rohit
 ipel main donon kaa hi form acha rahaa or warsop maichon main donon hi flop rahe
 In such a situation, Dhoni is in a dilemma
 fielding bhi donon kii hi umdaa he
 It is expected that Dhoni will keep his CSK Met Raina in the team and Rohit will have to sit on the bench

 Over the past few days, Pakistani drones have been spotted in the Indian border several times

 These drones entered the Indian border area several times
 husainivaala sector se sate kai gaanv ke logon ne bhi drone dekhe jane kii pushti kii thi

 drone ke jariye bharat main hathiyaar bhej rahaa pakpichley maheene 25 taarikh ko tarantaaran police ne jhabbal naamak jagah se ek nasht kiye gaye drone ko baraamad kiya tha
 Investigation revealed that Khalistan Zindabad Force and Khalistan Liberation Force militants used at least 4 drones to send arms consignments to India which penetrated the Indian border 7 to 8 times
 jaanch main yah baat bhi saamne ai ki pakistan main baithe khalistaan libration force or khalistaan jindabad force ke aatankwaadi ab tak drone ke jariye bharat main (12 sitambar se 24 sitambar) 12 dinon main 16 asolt rifles bhej chuke hai jinamein 4 AK-56, 5 AK-47 or 5 AK-74 rifl shaamil hai

 Let me tell you that in the past days, Aaj Tak had shown exclusive news that the students who topped 12th in the Bihar Board do not even have the basic knowledge of their subjects, after which the Bihar Government and the Bihar Board got into action and the results were canceled
 
 kya he bihar toppers ghotaalaa?bihar toppers ghotaalaa is saal may main us vakt saamne aayaa tha jab bihar board main arts kii topper rubi raay or science ke topper saurabh shreshth kaa intervyuu lene kuch patrkaar unke ghar pahunch gaye

 Australia's nine wickets had fallen to just 21 runs and were in danger of being dismissed for the lowest score in Test cricket, but Peter Siddle (12) and Nathan Lyon (14) added 26 runs for the last wicket
 The embarrassing record did not allow his team's name to be added
 test cricket main nunatam score kaa ricard newjiland ke naam par he jisaki puri team 1955 main england ke khilaaf aaisland main 26 ran banaakar out ho gayi thi
 This is the fourth lowest score by the Australian team, but this is the first time since 1902 when his entire team could not reach even 50 runs
 yah test cricket main kul milakar 18waan mauka he jabaki koi puri team ardhashatak bhi nahin bana paayi
 Australia, once the number one team in the world, has a minimum score of 36 runs, which he scored against England in 1902 in Birmingham
 isse pehle england ke khilaaf hi 1888 main uski team 42 ran jabaki isse do saal pehle 1886 main 44 ran par dher ho gayi thi
 This is the second occasion in the 21st century when a team has been dismissed for less than 50 in Test matches
 westeindies kii team bhi 2004 main england ke khilaaf kingston main 47 ran banaakar out ho gayi thi
 Not only this, the Australian team was reduced to only 18 overs
 ab vah sabase kam overon main out hone kii suchi main chauthe number par kabiz ho gayi
 The record is named after South Africa, whose team played 12–3 overs against England in 1924 in Birmingham

 tamilnadu kii hawa udhaas he
 The restlessness of the evening there, for 20 years, half of the four and a quarter states of North India can not feel your anchor reporting here incomplete
 raajnneeti ko jivan se bhi zyaada jeene vaale uttar bharat ke darshakon ke liye jayalalita bhale hi kisi myth kii tarah lagati hongi lekin tamilnadu kii public ke liye wo sirf myth nahin hai
 There is a reality which has grown silently away from the eyes of the North in its pillar, in front of which the greatest magnate of North India seems to be a minor
 isaki vajah ye rahi he ki uttar bharat kaa mahanayak pashchim se purab kaa mahanayake to ban jaataa he magar dakshin ke is rajya uski niyati sahaayak banane kii hi hoti he
 Every picture coming from Chennai is showing that someone rules their hearts
 yah mahaz kori bhavukta nahin he
 We all may feel emotional but emotionality is transitory
 raajnneeti main thodi lambii ho jaati he magar jab bhavukta itani lambii ho jaae ki chalis pantalis saal se bhi zyaada kaa lamhaa guzar jaae to use sirf bhavukta ke chashme se nahin dekhnaa chahie
 Crying faces outside of Apollo Hospital are not just evidences of sentimentality
 filmi parde kii nayika ko raajnneeti main ammaa kaa kitaab sirf bhavukta se nahin mil jaataa hoga
 Many came to politics from the curtain in the south but no Jayalalithaa could be made
 mjiaar, antiaar kaa apana mukaam he lekin jayalalita kaa mukaam kai myanon main unase bhi bada he
 Jayalalithaa also here, like the political magnates of North India, defeats the film superstars of the north
 mumbai ke bade star filmon se raajnneeti main to aae magar kabhi ji huzuri or salaam bajaane se zyaada kii haisiyat hasil nahin kar sake
 The superiors of the north are cursed to go ahead of the leaders
 wo sarkari yojanaon ke brands ambesadkar to ban sakate hai lekin apni filmi karishma ko kabhi raajnneetik puunji main nahin badal sake
 Perhaps they do not have that much capability
 ve zyada se zyada chatukaarita hi kar sakate hai
 Jayalalithaa of the South moves ahead in politics by coming from films
 raajnneeti ko badal detii he
 She makes Delhi government fall by sitting in Chennai
 jaise dilli kii gaddi par baithe netaa apni shekhi main madamast ho, jayalalita ne chupake se aakar uski kaan marod di ho
 Go see Jayalalithaa with feelings
 varna unke siyaasi yogadan ke saath aap insaaf nahin karenge
 She has been struggling in the hospital since 22 September
 jaise kisi diarector ko ansuna kar screept ko apane hisaab se badalakar tech dene kii zid savaar ho
 Today, when South India is busy with fears related to the most important leaders of its time, the political group of North India, who is going to India, is tinkling like an empty vessel to say what to say
 sune to kya sunen
 The year of 1982 was Jayalalithaa's first political speech in Cuddalore
 aaayeidiemke main sab kuch hasil kiya
 She fought with opponents, being a woman, fought with shameless allegations, even fought opponents
 34 saal tak 235 vidhansabhaon vaali tamilnadu kii raajnneeti main paanch baar chunaav jeetna aasaan nahin rahaa hoga
 In 2014, when the North Indian media was announcing the all-india Modi wave, Jaya was in awe of 39 mps from Tamil Nadu, a state bordering the Arabian Sea
 39 main 37 siton par ediemke jeet hasil karti he
 We can understand the difficulties of Apollo Hospital
 jayalalita kii sthiti karaab he
 AKMO uses machines only when the situation is extremely critical
 duaen apane charam par hai
 Doctors are taking all kinds of caution
 ilaaj ko lekar bhi or jayalalita ko lekar kis tarah se samvaad kiya jaae, soochna kisi ho ise lekar bhi jujh rahe honge
 Talked to a London doctor
 dilli se doctor ravaanaa hue hai
 We can understand how difficult it is for everyone at this time
 jazbaaton ke bavandar ke saamne khadey hokar medical duty puraa karnaa, use us rup main rakh dena, apni simaaon ke saath unke saamne apradhi kii tarah baahar aane kaa dar kitna bhayaavah hoga
 Imagine what would be going on with the doctors deposited around Jayalalithaa
 unase aaj bhagwaan hone kii ummid kii ja rahi he magar unhen yahi padhaayaa jaataa he ki doctor bhagwaan nahin he
 He just cures, someone else saves
 ham khabaranvison ke liye bhi chunauti he ki sahi khabar kya ho
 When are you thodi ruk kar khabar di jaae yaa pehle dene kii hode main ham un lakhon logon ke jazbaaton ko kured den jo pehle se hi baichaiyn hai
 Are not in their control hona to yahi chahie ki khabar pesh karne or use sunne ke bich bhaawanaaon kii koi seemaa na ho magar kai baar aapako khyaal karnaa padataa he
 How would the audience of Ratlam, Sikar, Jalaun, Banaras, Bhagalpur, Rewari, Chamba, Kullu feel the pessary sadness in the districts of Tamil Nadu today
 unka ankar to kabhi jayalalita se mila tak nahin he
 Never even touched Tamil politics
 paidaa hoti hai karnataka main lekin tamilnadu aakar kah detii hai ki main kannadiga nahin tamil hum
 The Ammu name of childhood changes to Amma
 vakil, doctor bananaa chaahati hai, maa filmon main le jaati hai
 Movies become invincible in politics
 jayalalita
 Do not always view politics with dry criticisms and slogans
 jayalalita ke liye yah lagaav harvard se dilli aakar raajnneetik dalon ke mukhyalayon ke peeche ke hisse main bane kamaron main twitor sambhaal rahe manageron kii dein nahin he
 The tweeter handle of his party was made only in February 2014
 39 main se 37 siten jiti
 You will see the analysis of all the newspapers coming out of Delhi at that time, two lines about Jayalalithaa and Naveen Patnaik will not be found properly
 naveen patnayak ne 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main 21 main se 20 siton par jeet hasil kii thi
 The comments ab ek sawaal uthta he ki jayalalita or naveen patnayak se apane garh main rashtriya dalon kaa vacharsv to tod diya lekin ve dilli ko pashchim or uttar bharat ke raajnneetik dabadabe se kyon nahin mukt kar sake
 Why could not all the talented leaders of South claim their claim among North India
 1984 main jayalalita rajyasabha kii sadsy banakar dilli to ain thim
 Why did Jayalalitha not choose any Mayawati like Kanshi Ram
 kya unhone ediemke kii niyati ko uske sahare chhodana thik samajha
 Even MGR did not hand over the legacy to any Jayalalithaa
 jayalalita kii raajnneetik kamyaabi or mukhyamantri ke rup main unke kaarykaal ko kaise yaad kiya jaae
 How should the people of North India know how this politician from Tamil Nadu changed the state after coming to power and made his position in the political party
 1989 main tamilnadu vidhansabha main jayalalita ke saath marpet hoti he
 She comes out wearing a torn sari and declares that she will return to the House only after becoming the Chief Minister
 paanch baar mukhyamantri banati hai
 In 1991, Jayalalithaa joins Congress to win 225 out of 234 seats
 thik chaar saal baad 2 june 1995 ko uttar pradesh kii rajdhani lakhanu ke guest house main mayawati ke saath marpet kii ghatana hoti he
 UP made Mayawati chief minister four times
 hamalaa mamata banerjee par bhi hota he
 Bengal ceded power to Mamata for the second time
 uttar bharat ke log bhakt ke bare main jaanate hai
 Devotee is that element of the politics of North India whose name is devotee but the rites are not of devotee
 uski bhashaa gaaliyon kii he
 Blind support
 maarane peetane kii he
 Is foolish
 bhakt hona siyasat main netaa kaa bahubali bananaa ho gaya he
 But how to understand this devotion of leaders in South India
 kya tasveeron main dikh rahe rote bilakhte log sirf samarthak kahe ja sakate hai
 Who are the people behind the pro
 kya ham jaan sakenge
 Jayalalithaa made her a Kora devotee with the help of social media or changed her life and she became devoted to Jaya
 chennai se aane vaali har tasviir yahi bataa rahi he ki koi unke dilon par raaj karata he
 This is not just emotional sentiment
 ham sab ko bhavukta lag sakati he lekin bhavukta kshanik hoti he
 In politics, it gets a little long, but when the sentiment becomes so long that more than forty-five years pass, it should not be seen only through the spectacles of sentimentality
 apollo aspataal ke baahar rote chehre sirf bhavukta ke pramaan nahin hai
 The heroine of the film screen would not have met Amma's title in politics only with emotion
 dakshin main parde se raajnneeti main to bahut aae lekin koi jayalalita nahin ban paaya
 MGR is ntr's own place but Jayalalithaa's position is bigger than hers in many ways
 jayalalita yahaan bhi uttar bharat ke siyaasi mahanayakon kii tarah uttar ke filmi mahanayakon ko maat de detii hai
 The big stars of Mumbai came into politics from films but could never achieve the status of more than playing Hazari and Salaam
 uttar ke mahanayake netaaon ke aage aage chalane ke liye abhishpt hai
 They may become brand ambassadors of government schemes but could never convert their film charisma into political capital
 shaayad unamem itani kshamta hi nahin he
 They can only do more sycophancy
 dakshin kii jayalalita filmon se aakar raajnneeti main aage aage chalati hai
 Changes politics
 wo chennai main baithkar dilli kii sarkaar gira detii hai
 Just as the leader sitting on the throne of Delhi is drunk in his boast, Jayalalithaa has come in secret and twisted her ear
 jayalalita ko bhaawanaaon se aage jaakar dekhiye
 Otherwise you will not be judged with his political contributions
 22 sitambar se ve aspataal main sangharsh kar rahi hai
 For example, insisting a director is insisting on changing the script according to his own ability
 aaj dakshin bharat jab apane samay ke sabase mahatvapurn netaa se judi ashankaon ko lekar ratjaga kar rahaa he, bharat bharat karne vaale uttar bharat kii raajnneetik jamaat khaali bartan kii tarah jhanjhna rahi he ki kahen to kya kahen
 Listen, listen
 1982 kaa saal tha, kaddlur main pehla siyaasi bhaashan diya tha jayalalita ne
 Achieved everything at AAAEDMK
 virodhiyon se ladiin, aurat hone ke naate naahak aaropon se ladati raheen, virodhiyon se to ladi hin
 It would not have been easy to win elections five times in Tamil Nadu politics with 235 assemblies for 34 years
 2014 main jab uttar bharat kaa media akhil bhartiya modi lahar kaa udghosh kar rahaa tha tab arab sagar ke kinare vaale rajya tamilnadu kii 39 saansadon par jaya kii bayaar chal rahi thi
 AIADMK wins 37 of 39 seats
 ham apollo aspataal kii mushkilon ko samaj sakate hai
 Jayalalithaa's condition is bad
 ekmo mashiinon kaa istamaal tabhi karte hai jab sthiti behad najuk hoti he
 Prayers are at their peak
 doctor har tarah kii satarkta barat rahe hai
 Regarding treatment and how to communicate with Jayalalithaa, how should the information be battling
 landan ke doctor se baat kii gai he
 The doctors have left Delhi
 ham samaj sakate hai ki is vakt sabake liye kitna mushkil he
 How frightening it would be to stand in front of a whirlwind of emotions and complete medical duty, keeping it in that form, fearing to come out like a criminal in front of them with their limitations
 aap kalpana kiijie jayalalita ke aas paas jamaa doctoron par kya guzar rahi hogi
 He is expected to be God today but he is taught that doctor is not God
 wo to bas ilaaj karata he, bachaata koi or he
 We also have a challenge for newsmen as to what is the right news
 kab ho
 In the race to give the news a little pause, or in the race to give first, let us crush the feelings of millions of people who are already restless
 apane kaabo main nahin hai
 It should be that there is no limit to the emotions between presenting the news and listening to it, but sometimes you have to take care
 ratlam, sikar, jalon, banaras, bhagalpur, rewadi, chamba, kullu ke darshak aaj tamilnadu ke zilon main pasri udaasi ko kaise mahasoos karenge
 His anchor has never even met Jayalalithaa
 tamil raajnneeti ko kabhi chhukar dekha bhi nahin
 Born in Karnataka, but Tamil Nadu comes and says that i am not Tamil, not Kannadiga
 bachapan kaa ammu naam ammaa main badal jaataa he
 Lawyer wants to become a doctor, mother takes him to films
 filmon se raajnneeti main ajey ban jaati hai
 Jayalalithaa
 raajnneeti ko hameshaa sukhi aalochanaon or naaron se mat dekhiye
 For Jayalalithaa, this attachment is not the result of managers handling the tweeters in the rooms in the back of the headquarters of political parties coming from Delhi to Delhi
 unki party kaa twitor handle to farvari 2014 main hi bana
 Won 37 seats out of 39
 aap us vakt ke dilli se nikalne vaale tamaam akhabaaron kaa vishleshan dekhiyegaa, jayalalita or naveen patnayak ke bare main do line bhi thik se nahin milegi
 Naveen Patnaik won 20 out of 21 seats in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 tippaniyan Now a question arises that Jayalalithaa and Naveen Patnaik broke the clout of national parties in their stronghold, but why they could not liberate Delhi from the political dominance of West and North India
 dakshin ke tamaam pratibhashali netaa apni daavedaari uttar bharat ke bich kyon nahin kar sake
 Jayalalithaa came to Delhi in 1984 as a member of Rajya Sabha
 jayalalita ne kanshiram kii tarah kisi mayawati kaa chunaav kyon nahin kiya
 Did they think it was right to abandon the aiadmk's destiny? mjiaar bhi to kisi jayalalita ko viraasat saunp kar nahin gaye the
 How to remember Jayalalithaa's political success and her tenure as Chief Minister
 uttar bharat ke log kaise jaane ki tamilnadu kii is rajaneta ne satta main aakar rajya ko kaise badla or raajnneetik dal main apni haisiyat kaise banaai
 Jayalalithaa is assaulted in the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly in 1989
 ve fatty sari pahanakar baahar aati hai or elaan karti hai ki mukhyamantri banakar hi sadan main lautengi
 Becomes Chief Minister five times
 1991 main jayalalita congress se milakar 234 main se 225 siten jeet jaati hai
 Exactly four years later, on June 2, 1995, an incident of assault with Mayawati takes place in a guest house in Lucknow, the capital of Uttar Pradesh
 upi ne mayawati ko chaar baar mukhyamantri banaaya
 The attack also takes place on Mamta Banerjee
 bengal ne duusari baar ke liye mamata ko satta saunp di
 People of North India know about the devotee
 bhakt uttar bharat kii raajnneeti kaa wo tatv he jiskaa naam to bhakt he magar sanskaar bhakt ke nahin hai
 His language is abusive
 andh samarthan kii he
 To beat morrkhtaa kii he
 Being a devotee has become the leader's muscle in politics
 lekin dakshin bharat main netaaon kii is bhakthi ko kaise samajha jaae
 Can the crying people seen in the photos be called just supporters? samarthak ke peeche ke log koun hai
 Can we know jayalalita ne soshal media ke sahare inhen kora bhakt banaaya yaa inaki zindagi badal di or ye jaya ko samarpit ho gaye
 Many came to politics from the curtain in the south but no Jayalalithaa could be made
 mjiaar, antiaar kaa apana mukaam he lekin jayalalita kaa mukaam kai myanon main unase bhi bada he
 Jayalalithaa also here, like the political magnates of North India, defeats the film superstars of the north

 wo to bas ilaaj karata he, bachaata koi or he
 We also have a challenge for newsmen as to what is the right news
 kab ho
 In the race to give the news a little pause, or in the race to give first, let us crush the feelings of millions of people who are already restless
 apane kaabo main nahin hai
 It should be that there is no limit to the emotions between presenting the news and listening to it, but sometimes you have to take care
 ratlam, sikar, jalon, banaras, bhagalpur, rewadi, chamba, kullu ke darshak aaj tamilnadu ke zilon main pasri udaasi ko kaise mahasoos karenge
 His anchor has never even met Jayalalithaa
 tamil raajnneeti ko kabhi chhukar dekha bhi nahin
 Born in Karnataka, but Tamil Nadu comes and says that i am not Tamil, not Kannadiga
 bachapan kaa ammu naam ammaa main badal jaataa he
 Lawyer wants to become a doctor, mother takes him to films
 filmon se raajnneeti main ajey ban jaati hai
 Jayalalithaa
 raajnneeti ko hameshaa sukhi aalochanaon or naaron se mat dekhiye
 For Jayalalithaa, this attachment is not the result of managers handling the tweeters in the rooms in the back of the headquarters of political parties coming from Delhi to Delhi
 unki party kaa twitor handle to farvari 2014 main hi bana
 Won 37 seats out of 39
 aap us vakt ke dilli se nikalne vaale tamaam akhabaaron kaa vishleshan dekhiyegaa, jayalalita or naveen patnayak ke bare main do line bhi thik se nahin milegi
 Naveen Patnaik won 20 out of 21 seats in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 tippaniyan Now a question arises that Jayalalithaa and Naveen Patnaik broke the clout of national parties in their stronghold, but why they could not liberate Delhi from the political dominance of West and North India
 dakshin ke tamaam pratibhashali netaa apni daavedaari uttar bharat ke bich kyon nahin kar sake
 Jayalalithaa came to Delhi in 1984 as a member of Rajya Sabha
 jayalalita ne kanshiram kii tarah kisi mayawati kaa chunaav kyon nahin kiya
 Did they think it was right to abandon the aiadmk's destiny? mjiaar bhi to kisi jayalalita ko viraasat saunp kar nahin gaye the
 How to remember Jayalalithaa's political success and her tenure as Chief Minister
 uttar bharat ke log kaise jaane ki tamilnadu kii is rajaneta ne satta main aakar rajya ko kaise badla or raajnneetik dal main apni haisiyat kaise banaai
 Jayalalithaa is assaulted in the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly in 1989
 ve fatty sari pahanakar baahar aati hai or elaan karti hai ki mukhyamantri banakar hi sadan main lautengi
 Becomes Chief Minister five times
 1991 main jayalalita congress se milakar 234 main se 225 siten jeet jaati hai
 Exactly four years later, on June 2, 1995, an incident of assault with Mayawati takes place in a guest house in Lucknow, the capital of Uttar Pradesh
 upi ne mayawati ko chaar baar mukhyamantri banaaya
 The attack also takes place on Mamta Banerjee
 bengal ne duusari baar ke liye mamata ko satta saunp di
 People of North India know about the devotee
 bhakt uttar bharat kii raajnneeti kaa wo tatv he jiskaa naam to bhakt he magar sanskaar bhakt ke nahin hai
 His language is abusive
 andh samarthan kii he
 To beat morrkhtaa kii he
 Being a devotee has become the leader's muscle in politics
 lekin dakshin bharat main netaaon kii is bhakthi ko kaise samajha jaae
 Can the crying people seen in the photos be called just supporters? samarthak ke peeche ke log koun hai
 Can we know jayalalita ne soshal media ke sahare inhen kora bhakt banaaya yaa inaki zindagi badal di or ye jaya ko samarpit ho gaye
 We can understand the difficulties of Apollo Hospital
 jayalalita kii sthiti karaab he
 AKMO uses machines only when the situation is extremely critical
 duaen apane charam par hai
 Doctors are taking all kinds of caution
 ilaaj ko lekar bhi or jayalalita ko lekar kis tarah se samvaad kiya jaae, soochna kisi ho ise lekar bhi jujh rahe honge
 Talked to a London doctor
 dilli se doctor ravaanaa hue hai
 We can understand how difficult it is for everyone at this time
 jazbaaton ke bavandar ke saamne khadey hokar medical duty puraa karnaa, use us rup main rakh dena, apni simaaon ke saath unke saamne apradhi kii tarah baahar aane kaa dar kitna bhayaavah hoga
 Imagine what would be going on with the doctors deposited around Jayalalithaa
 unase aaj bhagwaan hone kii ummid kii ja rahi he magar unhen yahi padhaayaa jaataa he ki doctor bhagwaan nahin he
 He just cures, someone else saves
 ham khabaranvison ke liye bhi chunauti he ki sahi khabar kya ho
 When are you thodi ruk kar khabar di jaae yaa pehle dene kii hode main ham un lakhon logon ke jazbaaton ko kured den jo pehle se hi baichaiyn hai
 Are not in their control hona to yahi chahie ki khabar pesh karne or use sunne ke bich bhaawanaaon kii koi seemaa na ho magar kai baar aapako khyaal karnaa padataa he
 How would the audience of Ratlam, Sikar, Jalaun, Banaras, Bhagalpur, Rewari, Chamba, Kullu feel the pessary sadness in the districts of Tamil Nadu today
 unka ankar to kabhi jayalalita se mila tak nahin he
 Never even touched Tamil politics
 paidaa hoti hai karnataka main lekin tamilnadu aakar kah detii hai ki main kannadiga nahin tamil hum
 The Ammu name of childhood changes to Amma
 vakil, doctor bananaa chaahati hai, maa filmon main le jaati hai
 Movies become invincible in politics
 jayalalita
 Do not always view politics with dry criticisms and slogans
 jayalalita ke liye yah lagaav harvard se dilli aakar raajnneetik dalon ke mukhyalayon ke peeche ke hisse main bane kamaron main twitor sambhaal rahe manageron kii dein nahin he
 The tweeter handle of his party was made only in February 2014
 39 main se 37 siten jiti
 You will see the analysis of all the newspapers coming out of Delhi at that time, two lines about Jayalalithaa and Naveen Patnaik will not be found properly
 naveen patnayak ne 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main 21 main se 20 siton par jeet hasil kii thi
 The comments ab ek sawaal uthta he ki jayalalita or naveen patnayak se apane garh main rashtriya dalon kaa vacharsv to tod diya lekin ve dilli ko pashchim or uttar bharat ke raajnneetik dabadabe se kyon nahin mukt kar sake
 Why could not all the talented leaders of South claim their claim among North India
 1984 main jayalalita rajyasabha kii sadsy banakar dilli to ain thim
 Why did Jayalalitha not choose any Mayawati like Kanshi Ram
 kya unhone ediemke kii niyati ko uske sahare chhodana thik samajha
 Even MGR did not hand over the legacy to any Jayalalithaa
 jayalalita kii raajnneetik kamyaabi or mukhyamantri ke rup main unke kaarykaal ko kaise yaad kiya jaae
 How should the people of North India know how this politician from Tamil Nadu changed the state after coming to power and made his position in the political party
 1989 main tamilnadu vidhansabha main jayalalita ke saath marpet hoti he
 She comes out wearing a torn sari and declares that she will return to the House only after becoming the Chief Minister
 paanch baar mukhyamantri banati hai
 In 1991, Jayalalithaa joins Congress to win 225 out of 234 seats
 thik chaar saal baad 2 june 1995 ko uttar pradesh kii rajdhani lakhanu ke guest house main mayawati ke saath marpet kii ghatana hoti he
 UP made Mayawati chief minister four times
 hamalaa mamata banerjee par bhi hota he

 uttar bharat ke log bhakt ke bare main jaanate hai
 Devotee is that element of the politics of North India whose name is devotee but the rites are not of devotee
 uski bhashaa gaaliyon kii he
 Blind support

 Is foolish

 But how to understand this devotion of leaders in South India
 kya tasveeron main dikh rahe rote bilakhte log sirf samarthak kahe ja sakate hai
 Who are the people behind the pro
 kya ham jaan sakenge
 Jayalalithaa made her a Kora devotee with the help of social media or changed her life and she became devoted to Jaya

 Hardik told that when he was feeling the pressure against Australia in his debut match, then Mahendra Singh Dhoni came and explained something to him, after which he was calm and able to make changes inside himself
 aapako bataa den ki pandya ne apane antarrashtriya kariyar ke pehle hi over main 21 ran die the, or kris lin ke saath budtamiji ko lekar isisi code of conduct kii bhi chetavanee bhi mili thi
 Pandya recalled that he was like a nightmare, after giving 21 runs in his very first over, i was feeling completely under pressure
 main bilkul blank mahasoos kar rahaa tha, kuch bhi samaj nahin aa rahaa tha
 But then Mahi Bhai came to me and he said, "will put another over"
 apane 1
 i gave away 28 runs after 1 over, but gave only 7-8 runs in subsequent overs
 uske baad bhi maahi bhai ne mujhe kuch nahin kaha
 Hardik said that Dhoni simply said that i knew that after the first over, you will bowl well

 South African President Jacob Zuma resigned from his post on Wednesday
 juma par pichley kuch samay se african neshnal congress (eensi) kii ore se pad chhodane kaa dabaav badhata ja rahaa tha
 With this, the 9-year rule of Zuma, which was in controversy over corruption and scams, came to an end

 haalanki sattadhari party kaa kahana tha ki guuruuvaar ko hone vaali baithak main voting ke jariye juma ko raashtrapati pad se hataa diya jaataa
 Let us tell you that Zuma resigned from his post only a few hours after the police raided the plush house of Gupta family of Africa
 bhartiya mul ke gupta parivaar ke saath jaikab juma kii saajhedaari hameshaa vivaadon main rahi he

 Who are the Gupta Brothers? Three brothers Ajay, Atul and Rajesh Gupta reached South Africa in the 1990s from Saharanpur

 ' There are 11 people of the same family of Delhi, whose death is being talked all over the country
 in 11 logon ke bich main wo lalit bhi he jise in samuhik maut kaa jimmedaar mana ja rahaa he
 It was Lalit who wrote the script of death
 wo lalit hi tha jiskaa daawa tha ki das saal pehle mar chuke uske pita naa sirf usase milane aate hai, balki wo unase baaten bhi karata tha
 It was Lalit who promised to introduce the entire family to his dead father and then to God
 wo lalit hi tha jisane purepariwarako fande par chadha kar ye bharosa dilaayaa tha ki tum log maroge nahin
 You would rather achieve something big
 magar aisa hua nahin
 The family of the dead body was hanging all over the house, it was said, 'at the last moment, there will be a shock, the sky will move, the earth will move
 lekin tum ghabraana mat, mantra jaap tej kar dena, main tumhe bachaa luungaa
 Getting down when the water changes color, helping each other down
 tum maroge nahin, balki kuch bada hasil karoge
 But regrettably no one came to save them and the house became a crematorium in a jolt, playing with 11 corpses
 50 saal pehle
 Narayan Devi was so much brother to Bhabha Singh, Chittorgarh, Rajasthan, that he decided to marry her
 
 Fearing that his father would not believe, Bhopal Singh left Haryana and went to Haryana

 Despite being strong with the family, Bhopal Singh did not take the help of his father and started plywood work in the city of Delhi himself
 kaam chal niklaa or kuch saalon main santnagar main khud kii ye imaarat khadi lee
 10 years ago
 santnagar, buraadi, dillibhopal singh kaa puraa parivaar dilli settle ho chukaa tha
 But then suddenly Bhopal Singh died
 bhopal singh kii maut ke baad chota betaa dinesh rajasthan laut gaya or ravatbhata main rahane laga
 Whereas, 11 people of the family now survived in this house in Santnagar, Delhi

 Father was pampered because Lalit was a small son, Lalit was dear to his father from the beginning
 baap kii maut kaa sabase zyaada sadma bhi use hi laga tha
 a few years after the death of Bhopal Singh, Lalit's voice also lost in an accident
 pita kii maut or awaz ke chale jane se lalit puri tarah se tut chukaa tha
 His voice did not return even after considerable treatment
 parivaar ke karibiyon ke mutabik isi dauraan lalit ne ghar waalon ko bachaana shuru kiya ki use uske pita bhopal singh dikhaai dete hai
 They also talk to them
 shared psycotic disorder se grasit tha lalitmedical science main ise shared psycotic disorder yaa diluzan bhi kehete hai
 This is a kind of disease in which someone starts to see and hear even after his death
 or aise log phir apane karibiyon ko bhi vahi mahasoos karwaanaa chahta he
 This type of disease is known to many people in the world and it is also treated in medical science

 He was joined by his wife Tina in this superstition
 jo pehle se hi behad dharmik thi
 Time passed and Lalit started seeing his father now

 Even now he started to take out his father's exact voice

 'there will be a shock at the last moment, the sky will move, the earth will move

 Getting down when the water changes color, helping each other down
 
 
 tum maroge nahin, balki kuch bada hasil karoge
 'it is recorded in the register that things like meeting God were written in the register which the police have recovered from this house
 isi register main pita bhopal singh kaa hawaale dete hue likhaa gaya he, 'main kal yaa parason aauungaa, nahin aa paaya to phir baad main aauungaa
 Every thing written in the register was written by Lalit
 kahani yaheen khatm nahin hui
 After meeting Lalit's father, he started talking about meeting God in this register
 jo is tarah likhi gayi jaise ye lalit nahin uske pita bhopal singh likh rahe hon
 It was further written in the register, 'you know that God can come to our house at any time, so be fully prepared
 'bachaane nahin aayaa koibakaul police wo lalit hi tha jo pita ke adeshon ko naa sirf register main likh rahaa tha
 But he was also completing it identically
 magar jis awaz ne lalit se sabko bachaa lene kaa vaada kiya tha
 He did not save
 asal main aisi koi awaz thi hi nahin
 This was just the gift of Lalit

 'big bos' ke ghar main 79wein din kii shuruyaat manu, manavir or mona kii baatcheet se hui, teenon nitibha ke bare main baat kar rahe the ki vah bani ke nakshekadam par chal rahi he or use lagata he ki vah akeli aage bad sakati he
 On the other hand Rohan tells Bani that Lopa does not understand things, he does not want Lopa to look wrong on TV
 rohan ne kaha ki unke maafee maangane ke baad bhi lopa kaa bihaviour vaisaa hi he
 Later, 'bigg Boss' gives the family a chance to increase the prize money of the show to 50 lakhs
 nitibha or swami om do-do hafton kii immunityiske liye vah malgadee task introdeus karte hai
 For this, 'bigg Boss' calls Rohan and Monalisa in the confession room and asks them to fix the price of the family
 rohan or mona lopa kii keemat sabase adhik or swami om kii keemat sabase kam lagaate hai
 For the goods train task, the garden area of the house was given the shape of a railway track, where an engine of the train and a jailed bogie were placed behind it
 mona or rohan ko jailer banaaya gaya jabaki ghar ke baaki sadasyon ko kaidi banaakar us jelnuma bogi main baithaaya gaya tha
 As per the rules of the game, Rohan and Mona were to release a prison inmate on each siren and hand it to the 'big Boss'
 reeha hone vaale kaidi kii keemat sho ke prise mani main judati jaaegi
 a twist in this task was that the prisoner who released himself from the bogey would become a contender for the captaincy of the house but his price would not be included in the prize money
 rohan or mona ko ingine main lage liver ko lagaataar ghumana tha
 The comments task shuru hone ke kuch der baad hi bani yah kahati hui baahar nikal gayi ki vah captency kaa task karnaa chaahati hai, haalanki lopamudra, nitibha or manavir ne unke is faisle kaa samarthan nahin kiya
 Shortly after Bani's exit, Swami Om returned to the house, yesterday's episode showed that he was forced to move out of the house due to circumstances created in the outside world
 aate hi unhone apni vicitra harakatein shuru kar deen
 As soon as Swami Om came to know that he would become the captaincy contender on leaving the bogey, he started trying to get out
 manu-manavir ne unhen samajhaayaa ki syran bajane ke baad hi vah baahar nikal sakate hai tab vah thodi der ke liye ruke
 After this, he exited as soon as the siren rang
 baad main 'big bos' ne unhen chetavanee di ki vah jail main waapas nahin jaaenge to unhen captaini kii daavedaari nahin milegi
 He then went back to jail
 rohan or mona ne sabase pehle lopamudra ko jail se reeha kiya
 Shortly thereafter, Swami Om got out of jail
 iske baad 'big bos' ne raat bhar ke liye task roak diya
 All of them appeared against Bani's decision to leave early
 der raat manu or nitibha manavir kii captaini or dosti par baat karne lage
 Manu said that Manveer always supports Swami Om and does not behave like the captain of the house
 vah nitibha se yah bhi kehete hai ki unhone hameshaa manavir ko saport kiya lekin vah aisa nahin karte
 Talking about the task, Manu said that as a friend Manveer should have told him or Nitibha that you guys go become captain, i sit here
 lekin unhone aisa nahin kaha
 At the same time, Lopamudra tells Rohan that Bani's friendship with Rohan is part of his strategy and Rohan should take care of him
 is par rohan ne kaha ki aisa kuch nahin he, bani kaa sabase acha dost ghar se chalaa gaya he or unhen cervive karne ke liye kisi na kisi se to baat kerani padegi
 She therefore talks to him
 baad main 'big bos' gharavaalon ko mauka dete hai sho kii prise mani badhaakar 50 lakh karne kaa
 Nitibha and Swami Om, for two-two weeks immunity, they introduce the goods train task 
 iske liye 'big bos' rohan or monalisa ko kanfeshan room main bulaate hai or unase gharavaalon kii keemat tay karne ke liye kehete hai
 Rohan and Mona charge Lopa the highest and Swami Om the lowest
 malgadee task ke liye ghar ke garden aria ko railway patari kaa rup diya gaya tha, jahaan train kaa ek ingine or uske peeche ek jelnuma bogi rakhi gai thi
 Mona and Rohan were made jailers while the rest of the members of the house were taken as prisoners and were seated in that jailed bogie
 khel ki niyamon ke anusaar har syran par rohan or mona ko jail main band ek kaidi ko reeha kar 'big bos' ko saunpna tha
 The price of the released prisoner will be added to the show's prize money
 is task main ek twist yah tha ki jo kaidi khud ko reeha kar bogi se nikalegaa vah ghar kii captaini kaa daavedaar ban jayega lekin uski keemat prise mani main nahin judegi
 Rohan and Mona had to rotate the engine-mounted liver continuously
 tippaniyan Shortly after the task started, Bani walked out, stating that she wanted to do the task of captivity, although Lopamudra, Nitibha and Manveer did not support her decision
 bani ke baahar nikalne ke kuch der baad hi swami om ghar main waapas aae, kal ke episod main dikhaaya gaya tha ki bahari duniya main bani paristhitiyon kii vajah se unhen ghar se baahar janaa pad rahaa he
 As soon as he came, he started his strange acts
 jaise hi swami om ko pataa chalaa ki bogi se nikalne par vah captaini ke daavedaar ban jaaenge, vah baahar nikalne kii koshish karne lage
 manu-manveer explained to him that he could come out only after the siren sounded, then he stopped for a while
 iske baad jaise hi syran baja vah baahar nikal gaye
 Later 'bigg Boss' warned him that if he does not go back to jail, he will not get the captaincy claim
 iske baad vah jail main waapas gaye
 Rohan and Mona first release Lopamudra from jail
 iske kuch der baad swami om jail se baahar nikal gaye
 After this, 'bigg Boss' stopped the task for the night
 jail se jaldi nikalne ke bani ke faisle par sabhi unke khilaaf najar aae
 Late in the night, Manu and Nitibha started talking about Manveer's captaincy and friendship
 manu ne kaha ki manavir hameshaa swami om kaa saath dete hai or ghar ke captain kii tarah bartaav nahin karte
 He also tells Nitibha that he always supported Manveer but he does not do so
 task ke bare main baat karte hue manu ne kaha ki dost hone ke naate manavir ko unase yaa nitibha se kahana chahie tha ki tum log jaao captain bano main yahaan baithta hum
 But he did not say so
 vahiin der raat lopamudra rohan se kahati hai ki bani kaa rohan se dosti badhanaa unki stritegi kaa hissaa he or rohan ko unase sanbhalkar rahanaa chahie
 On this, Rohan said that there is nothing like this, Bani's best friend has gone away from home and they will have to talk to someone or other to get help
 vah isliye unase baat karti hai

 Congress President Rahul Gandhi has instructed his party workers and leaders to learn from BJP and RSS
 rahul gandhi kaa yah bayaan ravivaar ko congress kaary samiti (CWC) kii baithak ke dauraan saamne aayaa he
 Meanwhile, Rahul Gandhi also emphasized on a strategy to defeat the BJP in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections
 unhone kaha ki sabhi vipakshi dal milakar loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ko haraayenge, lekin is bich congress adhyaksh ne apane bhaashan main bijepi or aresas kii karypranali kii baat kar party ke netaaon ko inase seekhney kii naseehat bhi de daali
 Interestingly, Rahul's nearly 17-minute speech delivered at the CWC meeting was uploaded to youtube by the party, but was removed within minutes
 iske baad se sawaal uth rahe hai ki party ne rahul kaa bhaashan utyub se kyon hataa liya? aakhir rahul gandhi ne apane bhaashan main kya kah diya, jo video ko utyub se hataanaa padaa? baharhaal, ham aapako bataate hai ki rahul ne CWC kii baithak main bijepi-aresas ko lekar kya kaha?bijepi or aresas se seekhen kathin parishram karnaah rahul gandhisutron ke mutabikrahulne CWC kii baithak main aae 200 se zyada party netaaon se kaha ki ham kathin morche par kaam karne se kataraate hai
 Giving the example of tribal community, Rahul said that this community was a Congress voter till a decade ago, but BJP and RSS people went among the tribals, worked with them, explained them and today they vote for BJP
 darasal, is udhaaharan ke jariye rahul kaa uddeshy bijepi va aresas dwaara kiye jane vaale parishram ko ujagar karnaa tha or congress netaaon ko bataanaa tha ki wo bhi isi tarah kathin parishram karne se na hichkichaayen
 Rahul Gandhi said that if the people of Congress are filled only with the tribals, then this community can again return to the Congress
 bijepi kii sarkaar banati he, to apane kaaryakartaaon ko detii he incentiveek anya party sutara ne bataaya ki samaapan bhaashan main rahul gandhi ne congress main kaaryakartaaon kii upeksha kaa mudda bhi uthaaya
 He said that when the BJP government is formed, it gives an 'incentive' to its workers, whereas there is no question of the Congress worker in his government
 lihaaja wo (rahul gandhi) jahaan bhi jate hai, congress kaaryakarta unase upeksha kii shikaayat karte hai
 This was the second point in the CWC meeting when Rahul ceded the Congress leaders by giving an example of the BJP and the Sangh
 bijepi itihaas main le janaa chaahati he or congress bhavishya main: rahul gandhicongress kaary samiti kii baithak main rahul gandhi kaha ki bijepi kii sarkaar banane par wo aresas se judi sansthaaon jaise - saraswati shishu mandir aadi kii madad karti he
 He said that the challenge is not just to change the government, but also to repair the way the institutions have been damaged in the BJP government
 rahul gandhi ne kaha ki bijepi hajaaron saal pehle ke itihaas kii baat karti he, jabaki congress bhavishya kii baat karti he

 The District Police and Crime Branch investigated both the sites
 team ne aise log chhante jinaki umr 18 se 40 varsh ke bich kii thi
 The police feared the involvement of the nearby residents as there was not much distance in both the places

 He said, "my biggest concern is whether we are able to provide justice to all?" Along with this, he also talked about the cost of justice being expensive
 rajasthan ucch nyaayalay (rajasthan High Court)ke naye bhawan ke udghaatan kaarykram ko sambodhit karte hue kovind ne kaha, ‘‘puraane samay main, rajmahalon main nyaay kii guhaar lagane ke liye latakaai gai ghantiyon kaa ullekh hota rahaa he
 Any person could ring the bell and pray to the king to get justice
 kya aaj koi garib yaa vanchit varg kaa vyakti apni shikaayat lekar yahaan aa saktaa he?''unhone kaha, ‘‘yah sawaal sarvaadhik mahatvapurn he, kyonki samvidhan kii prastaavna main hi ham sab ne, sabhi ke liye nyaay sulabh karaane kaa daayitv sweekaar kiya he
 "he said," My biggest concern is whether we are able to provide justice for all? "the President said that he wants to repeat his words as stated on Constitution Day
 unhone kaha, ‘‘samvidhan diwas ke din maine jo baaten ucchtam nyaayalay main saajha kii thim unamem se kuch pramukh baton ko main yahaan doharaana chahta hum
 "he said," Father of the Nation Mahatma Gandhi was also very concerned about the expenditure incurred in the process of justice
 unke liye hameshaa daridranarayan kaa kalyaan hi sarvopari tha
 Following them, all of us should ask ourselves this question: Has justice been accessible to every citizen? ”kovind also mentioned in his address the cost of justice
 unhone kaha, ‘‘main bhaleebhanti yah samajhataa hum ki anek kaarnon se nyaay-prakriya kharchili hui he, yahaan tak ki jan-saamaanya kii pahunch ke baahar ho gai he
 Especially in the High Court and the Supreme Court, it has become impossible for the common complainant
 ''unhone kaha, ‘‘lekin agar ham gandhiji kii prasiddh ‘kasuti' ko dhyaan main rakhte hai, agar ham sabase garib or kamjor vyakti kaa cheharaa yaad karte hai to hamen sahi raah nazar aa jaaegi
 For example, we can help the needy by providing free legal aid

 unhone kaha, ‘‘nyaay vyavastha se judi meri baaten yahaan ke logon tak aasaani se pahunch saken, isiilie maine yah sambodhan hindi main kiya he
 '' rafel deal par vivaad thamane kaa naam nahin le rahaa
 In India, the Supreme Court is going to start hearing the case again about this deal, while the local media in France reported that the French authorities had helped Anil Ambani in repaying the debt
 haalanki is reports se france or bharat donon ne hi inkaar kiya he
 India has termed it as partisan news
 france ne shanivaar ko safai dete hue kaha ki vahaan ke kar vibhaag or reliance kii sahyogi company ke bich kar chhot ko lekar vaishvik sahmati bani thi or isamen kisi bhi tarah kaa raajnneetik hastkshep nahin kiya gaya he
 This clarification has been given by the French media after the news that Anil Ambani's French company has been told to get huge tax exemption
 raajnneetik hastkshep nahinfrance ke charchit akhbaar laa monde ne 36 rafel vimaanon kii kharid kii bharat kii ghoshnaa ke baad anil ambani kii aguwai vaali reliance communications kii ek sahyogi company kaa 14

 The dispute was resolved through a common process of administration, following legislative and thorough rules
 ’ french duutavas kii ore se kaha gaya ki vivaad kaa samaadhaan karne main kisi bhi tarah kaa raajnneetik hastkshep nahin kiya gaya
 Biased news
 On the other hand, the Ministry of Defense of India denied the reports in the French media, calling it an inference-based report
 raksha mantralay ne rafel deal or tex masale ko ek saath jodakar dekhne sambandhi report par kaha ki hamane ek privet company ko tex main mili chhot or bharat sarkaar kii ore se rafel saude ke bich sambandhon ko jodne vaaleen khabaren dekhi he
 The tax exemption period and the content of the exemption have no relation to the Rafale deal made by the present government
 tex se jude masale or rafel maamle ko ek saath jodakar dekhnaa puri tarah galat or pakshpatpurna he
 On April 10, 2015, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the purchase of 36 Rafale aircraft in Paris with the then President of France, François Hollande
 haalanki is saude ke baad congress lagaataar centre kii mohi sarkaar par bhrashtachar karne kaa aarope lagaati rahi he
 The Congress alleges that the Modi government is procuring an aircraft at a rate of Rs 1,670 crore, while the then UPA government confirmed the deal at the rate of Rs 526 crore per aircraft
 congress or party adhyaksh rahul gandhi anil ambani kii aguwai vaali reliance dephence ko daso avinshan kaa ofaset saajheedaar banane ko lekar bhi centre sarkaar ko nishaanaa bana rahi he
 Apart from the allegations, the government has been rejecting these allegations
 samachar patr ne kaha ki france ke adhikariyon ne reliance flag atlantic france kii jaanch kii or paaya ki 2007-10 ke bich use chah karod euro ke kar kaa bhugtan karnaa tha
 Although Reliance offered 76 million euros to settle the case, the French authorities refused to accept the amount

 All the highways of the country will now be equipped with smart technology
 sarkaar ne haive koor zyada surakshit banane ke liye satellite ke jariye projects kii deepiar taiyaar karne kaa man bana liya he

 In this conference, many companies that make and sell such equipment in the country and abroad also participated and gave their suggestions
 chaalak or parivahan par hogi paini nigahek chota sa upkaran naa sirf parivahan ko aasaan bana degaa, balki chaalak or vaahan par paini nigaah bhi rakhega
 That is, with only one chip fitted in the car, both the driver and the transport will be under control
 jeepies system se lasis upkaran ke jariye desh bhar ke dhaai lakh se zyada motor yatayaat police ke javaanon or adhikariyon ke kaam kaa boj kam kiya ja saktaa he
 According to experts, there will be no need to check documents like insurance, pollution certificate after installing these equipment
 sara kaam automatic hoga
 If someone violates a traffic light or drives at a higher speed than the prescribed limit, then this device will automatically report it
 kisi agle toll naake par pahunchane par vahaan vaahan maalik ke acount sejurmaane kii rakamkat jaaegi
 If the toll is not obstructed, then any petrol pump will be refueled, then there will be an automatic arrangement to collect the fine from it
 yatayaat pulicekarmiyon kaa ghatega bojhamantralay ke iti task force ke sadsy vineet goyanka ne bataaya ki iske jariye kai tarah se yatayaat ko niyantrit kiya ja saktaa he
 Also, lakhs of police personnel can get free time from this work and they can be used in law and order
 iske alaava haive nirmaan main bhi satellite ke jariye nigaah rakhi jaaegi
 The new equipment will also increase the lifespan of the highway
 He said that it will also monitor things like highway alignment, the condition of trees and the quality of highway construction
 visheshgyon kii team haive ke aasapaas kii mitti main hi rasinic pratikriya se aisa asar paidaa karegi ki vahaan kii mitti pathar se bhi sakht or haive ke upyukt ho jaaegi
 Due to which there will not be accidents like road sinking as well as the age of the highway will also increase

 Virat Kohliraj is the captain of Team India's Test team and you will be surprised to know the reason of displeasure
 australian daure par test siries main unka balla jamkar chalaa lekin tri siries main viraat kaa balla khamosh ho gaya he
 The resentment behind this silence is that he has not been given the captaincy of the ODI team and Anushka Sharma is not allowed to be with him during the World Cup
 viraat kohli ke naam khulaa khat
 
 
 If you are angry now, then it will come out too, so sir is drawing this anger through his batting
 gupt sutron ne bataaya he ki bisisiai ne jabase cricketron kii patniyon or garlfrends ko world cap ke dauraan saath nahin rahane kaa farmaan sunaaya he viraat munh phulaakar baithe hai
 Seeing Anushka in the spectator gallery during the Test series, Virat hit a lot of fours and sixes, but now if Anushka can not see him playing LIVE, then for whom will she score, who will fly to Pachasa and Century? While Virat was dismissed in the series, it was proving to be a crook for the Australian bowlers, while in the two matches of the Tri-series, Virat in 9 innings And 4 returned to the pavilion runs
 australian gendbaaj james foconor or angarej gendbaaj steven fin ko unhen out karne main koi mashkkat bhi nahin kerani padi
 In both matches, Virat returned to the pavilion with his wicket gift
 unhen lag rahaa he ab world cap main to anoushka unke saath hongi nahin to usase pehle tri siries ke dauraan maidan kii bajaay apni garlfriend ke saath hi time paas kar liya jaae
 Now if anger is only one thing, then Virat's displeasure is also on the fact that he was not given the command of the ODI team
 team diarector ravi shastri kaa sir par haath he baavjood iske vanade team ke captain abhi bhi captain kool em es dhoni hi hai
 If the BCCI wants Virat's bat to run like butter and keep on scoring runs, then he will have to overcome Virat's displeasure
 gupt sutron ne to yahaan tak bataaya he ki viraat kii naaraazgi dur karne ke liye dhoni ko world cap se pehle vanade captaini se hatane ke liye manaa liya gaya he or anoushka ko bhi bharat ke har match main mistar india vaali ghadi pahanakar darshak ddeergha main baitaane kaa intjaam kar liya liya gaya he

 Modi wrote in his blog that there is something special in the soil of India that makes it Jagadguru
 unhone ek majboot, viksit or samaveshi bharat banane kaa aahvaan kiya jo ek baar phir duniya kaa maardarshak bane
 The Prime Ministerial BJP candidate thanked the people of the country for supporting him and assured that he will lay the foundation of a strong India with unprecedented growth
 apane lambey prachaar abhiyaan ko saghan, nae taur-tareeke vaala or santoshjanak qaraar dete hue modi ne kaha, 'hamaare prachaar abhiyaan ke dauraan bhaajapa ne vikaas or sushasan ke agenda ko bharat ke har kone main pahunchaaya

 himachal pradesh ke vidhansabha chunaav kii tarikhon kaa elaan aaj ho saktaa he
 While the Congress is struggling to save its power, the BJP on the other hand hopes to return to power with Modi
 pichley kuch vidhansabha chunaav ke nateezon ko dekhen to saaf he ki ek baar congress or ek baar bijepi rajya kii satta ke singhaasana par kabiz hoti rahi he
 There are a total of 68 assembly seats in Himachal Pradesh
 pichley vidhansabha chunaav main rajya kii 68 siton main se congress ko 36, bijepi ko 26 to anya ko 6 siten mili thim
 The Congress had gained 13 seats in the 2012 assembly elections compared to 2007, while the BJP had lost 16 seats in 2012 compared to 2007
 congress ke vot bade, bijepi ke ghate2012 vidhansabha chunaav main mili voton par najar daalen to congress ko 43 fisadi or bijepi ko 39 fisadi vot mili the
 Compared to 2007, the Congress vote increased by 5 per cent while the BJP lost 5 per cent of the vote
 bijepi mahaj 4 fisadi voton se congress se peeche rahi lekin congress kii tulana main use 10 siten kam milin
 It is clear from the results of Himachal Assembly Elections 2012 that the people of the state changed the power and handed over the reins of the Congress
 himachal kii satta ke singhaasana par 2012 main congress ke virbhadra singh kii tajposhi hui, lekin paanch saalon main unhen kai mushkilon kaa saamana karnaa padaa he
 The conflict between Virbhadra Singh and Himachal Pradesh Congress Committee President Sukhwinder Singh Sukhu came to the fore
 himachal ke 21 vidhayakon ne virbhadra singh ke netritv main chunaav ladane se manaa kar diya he
 BJP will ask for votes in the name of Modi
 BJP is with the support of Modi to return to power
 maujuuda samay membijapi himachal main kisi chehreko aage nahin badha rahi he
 The BJP is following in the footsteps of UP, Uttarakhand, Haryana, Maharashtra and Jharkhand
 yani yahaan bhi chunaav jeetne ke baad mukhyamantri kaa cheharaa pesh kar sakati he
 Let us tell you that as many assembly elections have been held in Himachal Pradesh since 1985
 inamen ek baar congress to ek baar bijepi satta ke singhaasana par kabiz hui he
 Himachal Legislative Assembly was formed in 1962
 isse pehle himachal punjab kaa hissaa hua karata tha
 Assembly elections have been held in Himachal Pradesh 12 times
 inamen se 8 baar congress, 3 baar bijepi or 1 baar janata party satta ke singhaasana par kabiz hui he
 The first setback for the Congress in Himachal was in 1977, when it was badly defeated by the Janata Party
 1977 main janata party kii sarkaar bani to shanta kumaar himachal ke mukhyamantri bane
 After this, in the 1982 assembly elections, the Janata Party lost to the Congress
 1985 main hue vidhansabha chunaav main congress phir satta par kabiz hui
 But after this, in the 1990 assembly elections, BJP came back to power with a strong majority and Shanta Kumar became the Chief Minister
 par teen saal baad 1993 main jab vidhansabha chunaav hue to bijepi ko haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa or congress kii satta main vaapasi hui
 History will be repeated or miracle Five years later, in the 1998 assembly elections, the Congress faced defeat and the BJP returned to power and Prem Kumar Dhumal became the Chief Minister
 iske baad jab 2003 main vidhansabha chunaav hue to bijepi ko congress ne shikast dete hue satta main vaapasi kii
 Similarly, in the 2007 assembly elections, the Congress was ousted from power and the BJP returned
 himachal ne 2012 main phir apane itihaas ko doharaaya or congress kii vaapasi hui or bijepi satta se out ho gai
 If we look at this political tradition, then this time the BJP is assuming its victory confidently
 duusari ore congress jis antarkalah se jujh rahi he or virbhadra singh jis tarah ke aaropon main fanse hai use dekhte hue party ko apni satta bachaane ke liye kisi chamatkaar kii hi ummid rakhni hogi

 in shabdon ke saath akadate or hawa main mutthiyaan laharaate hue donald jon trump ne june 2015 main duniya kii sabase taqatvar kursi ko hasil karne ke liye jab apana chunaav prachaar shuru kiya to shaayad hi kisi ne unhen gambhirtha se liya tha
 At that time he was just president of the Trump Organization, a property called Kubera, which built middle-class houses, large resorts and golf courses
 or unhone jo kuch banwaaya, us par apana upnaam bade or sunahare aksharon main ankit karvaa diya
 Trump was dismissed as an old-fashioned reality TV star who frantically flaunted his status as Dhankuber ("i'm really, really rich"), and made big claims about his achievements in business
 Used to live lekin jab usase uske tex ritern ke bare main poocha jaataa to vah daaen-baayen jhaankne lagata tha
 The way Trump spoke about women and made derogatory accusations against all of his opponents, including US President Barack Obama, it seems that he has no control over his own tongue
 ve obama ke bare main kah gaye ki unka janm america main nahin hua tha or ve ek gupachup-musalmaan hai
 Even when Trump won the candidacy from the Republican Party, everyone was stunned
 unki apni party ko hi ummid nahin thi ki ve raashtrapati kaa chunaav jeet jaaenge
 On the other hand, his anti-democratic Hillary Clinton exemplifies the great personality
 unki uplabdhiyon ko dekha jaae to ve apane desh main post-graduate degree rakhane vaali pehali pratham mahila rah chuki thim, pehali aisi pratham mahila thim, jo ek chune hue pad par asin rah chuki thim or videsh mantri rahi thim or ek badi rajnatik party kii ore se raashtrapati pad kii pehali mahila ummidavaar thim
 If she had won the presidential election, she would have become the first woman president of the US and thus the rightful successor of America's first black President Obama
 matdaan ke ain pehle tak zyaadaatar chunaav panditon ne trump ke haarane kii bhavishyavaanee kii thi
 Earlier, more than 150 leading newspapers of America had predicted the victory of Hillary Clinton
 phir bhi trump yah kehete hue date rahe ki ''main har ek ko galat sabit kar duungaa, har ek ko
 "in his election rallies, he told the people," America no longer needs only leaders who do only rhetoric and work
 " use kushalta se kaam karne vaale logon kii jarurat he, jo samajhate hai ki kaam kaise kiya jaataa he
 We do not need political juggles — we need common sense
 america dub chukaa he
 We should stop talking about this and solve this problem
 main jaanata hum ki yah kaise ho ja saktaa he
 When Trump's results were announced on the morning of 9 November, Trump not only defeated Hillary Clinton, but also silenced his critics by defeating the majority
 ab ve 20 janvari, 2017 ko america ke 45wein raashtrapati ke rup main shapath lene ja rahe hai
 Donald Trump managed to win the hearts of frustrated middle-class Americans — mainly whites and Christians — who went on to gain his support
 unka samarthan karne vaale madhyavargeey americanyon kaa maananaa tha ki saal dar saal ve aarthik rup se behad kamjor ho gaye hai or satta-tantra—washington disi, ke raajnneetikon kaa kuleen samooh, jisamen hillari clinton bhi shaamil hai, is haalat ke liye jimmedaar he
 Former National Security Advisor and currently distinguished thinker at the American think tank Brookings Institution sees the triumph of Shivshankar Menon Trump as part of the worldwide loosening of the elite and the collapse of the world's older establishments and their ideologies
 inamen udaarvaad kaa patan bhi shaamil he
 He believes that by the day most countries are turning to "authoritarianism, conservatism, conservatism and a strong leadership"
 unki raay he ki britain sahit kai deshon main apravasiyon ke khilaaf naaraazgi ke kaaran kumparasti badi he
 This is the reason why the people of Britain supported Brexit to break away from Europe this year
 janvari main jab trump ovel offis main baithenge to unhen buree tarah bante america kaa saamana karnaa padegaa—jiske liye kuch had tak ve khud bhi jimmedaar hai
 They have deepened this division on the basis of gender, race, religion and class with their poisonous and unbridled electoral propaganda
 is chunaav main hillari clinton ke kul milakar popular vot jeetne se saaf he ki ab america do hisson main bant gaya he
 Trump's America is full of fierce nationalism, he is opposed to globalism, and he has a feeling of fear towards foreigners
 uskaa maananaa he ki america ko sampann or zyada america hona chahie
 On the other hand, Hillary's America is more inclusive and multi-cultural, because she believes that America's good faith has made her great
 phir, raashtrapati ke rup main trump kaa kaam or unki kaaryastylee kya hogi? haal ke itihaas main trump aise pehle america raashtrapati hai, jo isse pehle kisi bhi sarkari pad par nahin rahe hai
 Nor is he known as a person who has a deep opinion of himself on big issues
 washington sthit ek thinkatank stimson centre ke sansthaapak adhyaksh maaikel crepan raashtrapati trump kii sambhaavnaaon ke bare main apni ashanka ko chhipate nahin hai
 He says, "the first thing we know about them is that they love themselves
" duusari cheez yah he ki unhen bilkul bhi pataa nahin he ki duniya kaise kaam karti he or unke irdagird aise log jamaa hai, jinke paas bhi is bare main simit jaankaree he
 "in Trump's limited dictionary, nations or people are either good and beautiful or are evil and wicked (he said to Hillary," "how ill-tempered a woman is
" '') or ghatnaayen or sthitiyaan 'mahaan' yaa 'badahaal' hoti hai
 During his election campaign Trump constantly changed his opinion and appeared to be standing on both sides on major issues (although Hillary did the same)
 trump shuru main to garbhpaat ke paksh main the or baad main 'jivan ke liye' ho gaye
 He first talked about stopping immigrants and later softened his stand
 isi tarah ve vyapaar ke pakshdhar or virdohi hone ke bich atake rahe
 Expressing his opinion about governance in his book Crippled America, Trump writes, "we need a leader who can overcome our troubles and start working out practical solutions to the problems
" '' ve aage likhte haih ''meraa lakshya dusron kii tarah sarkari kanoonon ke hajaaron panne taiyaar karnaa nahin he
 We need policies with practical intelligence and we should strictly implement them if needed
 ''unke chunavi bhaashanon se yah saaf ho jaataa he ki unke shashan kaa mukhya siddhant rashtrawaad, sangrakshanvaad or algaavvaad par aadhaarit hoga
 Ashley J
, Senior Associate of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace
 telis, jo republican or democratic donon hi sarkaron main kaam kar chuke hai, maanate hai ki pehle din se hi trump ''mul americanyon kaa hity dekhnaa shuru karenge, kyonki jin logon ne unhen vot diya he, unka maananaa he ki pichley do dashakon main arthvyavastha ke vaishvikaran ke kaaran unka ahit hua he
 Therefore, the issues that Trump will first focus on are domestic economic and social priorities, such as creating more jobs, increasing income, providing better healthcare, improving infrastructure and reducing crime in cities
 apana lakshya hasil karne ke prayaas main trump akele hi sab kuch durust karne vaale daste kii tarah kaam karnaa chaah rahe hai
 On the very first day of his appointment, he plans to cancel the Affordable Care Act
 is kanoon ko 'obamakare' ke naam se zyada janaa jaataa he
 The legislation is considered by the current president to be a major task of increasing the quality of healthcare and making it affordable
 logon kii jeb main zyada paise daalane ke liye tex main katautee karne ke alaava trump yah bhi vaada kar rahe hai ki ve america ke charmarate buniyadi dhaanche ko phir se majboot karnaa chaahate hai, jinamein airport or railway stesan shaamil hai
 Other issues of Trump will be how to control large power centers in the US, as they serve to curb and balance presidential rights — including the Senate and Supreme Court
 trump kii kismat acchhee he ki chunaavon ke maujuuda chakramen seenet main republican bahumat main hai or house of riprogentatius main bhi unhen bahumat mila hua he
 This would not lead them to confrontation, as Obama had to do in both houses of Congress during his tenure
 isliye trump ek laabhadaayak sthiti ke saath daftar main kadam rakh rahe hai
 They are also not bound by the party's instructions as they have won a shocking victory at a time when the Republican Party felt divided and weakened
 ashanka bas ek hi he ki trump ke apane shabdon main ve 'akele sipaahi' hai
 Therefore, if the newly elected President wants to advance his revolutionary agenda, he will have to learn the tricks of building bridges to connect both directions
 ab tak yah aalochana hoti rahi he ki trump ke paas pratibhashali logon kii kami he or unki team ke zyaadaatar salaahkaaron ke paas anubhav kii bahut kami he, khaskar jab shashan chalaane or videsh niti kaa maamla ho
 Responding to his critics, Trump said, "look at the state of the world at this time
 vah bahut kharaab sthiti main he
 Never before had a more dangerous time come
 washington ke sattadhari varg ke bheetar tathakthith andruni log ve hai, jinhone hamen musiibat main daal diya he
 So why should we pay attention to them
 ''ab jis baat par gaharaai se najar hogi, vah yah he ki ve videsh, raksha, tregeri, grih suraksha or siie jaise mahatvapurn padon par kise rakhte hai
 Looking at his revolutionary and sometimes provocative speeches during the elections, Trump's foreign policy will be closely watched by experts and governments everywhere
 unke chunavi vaadon kii kuch bangiah apravas par (america kii dakshini seemaa par oonchi deevaaren bana do or duusare deshon ke utpaadakon par baari jurmaana lagaao), videsh vyapaar (nafata par phir se baat karo or china ke liye shulk badhaao), dablutio (ham kadaa molbhav karenge), antarrashtriya gathjodon (nato ke sadasyon ko suraksha ke liye apni dendariyaan bharani hongi), rus (putin ek tej vyakti hai), iran (raashtrapati banate hi main newclear sauda radd kar duungaa), jalwaayu parivartan sandhi (global varming sirf ek hauva he) or islamic aatankwaad (ham iageies par itnaa joardaar or teji se hamalaa karenge ki kisi ke liye bhi khatra nahin rahegaa)
 Former Indian Ambassador to the US Meera Shankar says, "whether the trumps will prove to be a threat to the world or not, we will have to wait
" lekin unke ravaiye se puri duniya main anishchay kii sthiti he
 "trump's theory" in the matter of foreign policy was formulated with great prudence early in his election campaign: "we will work with strength
" iskaa matlab he ki hamen duniya main ab tak kii sabase majboot sena banaae rakhni hogi
 We have to show that the countries that work together with us, will have to be rewarded with their economic strength and those who are not together, will have to be punished
 hamen apane sahyogiyon ke saath aisa gathjod bananaa hoga, jinase aapasi phayda ho
 If we remain watchmen for the whole world, then we should get its price
 ''apravas par trump ke kattar vichaaron kaa asar america ke padosi deshon or sankat se ghire pashchim asia par pad saktaa he
 During his election campaign, he attacked the illegal infiltration fiercely and his words were very passionate: "the countries of our south are not sending their best people
 sirf mexico se hi nahin, balki duusare deshon se bhi bure log hamaare desh main ghuse aa rahe hai
 i will build a high wall and no one can build a good wall from me
 or mere shabdon ko dhyaan main rakho, mexico ko is diwaar ke liye paise dene honge
 "and Syria Parru", giving refuge to thousands of people in Syria will certainly cause many problems
 ham nahin jaanate ki ve kitni vikat hongi, kyonki hamaare paas koi suraksha nahin he or na hi hamaare paas waisi yogyata he
 It has to be stopped and stopped early
 ''videsh niti ke maamle main asli chintaa he vaishvik vyapaar, suraksha gathjod or aarthik gutbaji ke prati trump kaa ravaiya
 Tallis says that Trump, as president, will have the right to cancel treaties signed by the United States
 lekin in sawaalon par america bijness kii ore se unhen kadi raay kaa saamana karnaa padegaa
 He warns against indiscriminately canceling treaties and threatening NATO members for security money, "the US may lose its benefits on changing policy in West Eurasia
" puri europea vyavastha us vaade par nirbhar karti he ki bahya suraksha chunautiyon kii jimmedaari america ke netritv vaale gathjod par hogi
 If you eliminate it, you will give the Russians and anyone a leeway to peel Europe like layers of onions
 yah vishwayuddh ke 65 varshon baad america kii puri us niti ko bigaadia hoga, jo hamaare hit main rahi he
 "menon predicts Trump may not be as much an interfering president as his predecessors
 america kii dakhsandaji kam hone se rus, china or bharat jaise majhole takat vaale deshon kii ore se antarrashtriya maamalon main dakhal dene kii sambhaavna bad jaaegi
 If Trump trumps the world order as promised, India has to be vigilant

 Whether he did it intentionally or in Nadani, but in a meeting of his election campaign, he was seen only joining with the Hindus and he had made some telling remarks about how the 'hindu community has brought about world consciousness and American culture

 or ham swatantra udhyamshiltaa, kadi mehnat, paariwarik mulyon or ek majboot america videsh niti ke hamaare saajha mulyon kaa jashn manaane kii ummid karte he
 However, the relationship with Hindustan does not appear above his priorities
 magar unhone americanyon ke liye zyada naukariyaan muhaiyaa karwaane kii khatir hunarmandon ko die jane vaale skild vija kii taadaad ghataane kii maang kii thi or america companiyon se kaha tha ki ve khuli naukariyon ke liye america kamgaaron ko tavajjo den, isane bhartiya ity companiyon or pravaasiyon ko chintaa main daal diya he
 Nevertheless, experts overall feel that the relationship between India and the US has reached a stage in the last decade where changing the government is unlikely to affect their speed
 videsh mantralay ke ek bade afasar kehete hai, ''chunaav koun jitegaa yah sochakar ham raaton kii neend kharaab nahin karte
 During the last decade, we have collected so many resources that we can reach anyone on our own
 or america se hamaara rishta itnaa pakkaa ho chukaa he ki kisi bhi desh main netritv badalane se dhakka nahin lagata
 "but there are definitely concerns about how they will deal with China
" obama prashasan ne china ko gherne ke makasad se ek asian dhuree ke liye jor lagaaya tha or is ilaake main america ke ranneetik guna-bhaag main bharat ek bada khilaadi tha
 Trump's policy regarding China is unclear, except that he can be strict about business relationships
 lekin dakhsandaji kii america niti par unke sandehon or etraajon ko dekhte hue dakshin china sagar main china ke aakraamak vistaaravaadi iraadon ko lekar unka prashasan banisbatan kam sakht ho saktaa he
 Nor is there any possibility that they will pressurize China to prevent the entry of India's entry into the Nuclear Suppliers Group
 yah bharat ke liye acchhee khabar nahin he
 As far as Pakistan is concerned, it is unlikely that Trump will make any radical change in US policy towards it
 yues institute of pis ke asia centre ke associat vaais president or pakistan ke saath america rishton ke visheshgy moid yusuf maanate hai ki trump islamabad ke saath rishte tode bagaiyr us par lagaam kasne kii vyapak sarvanumati jari rakhenge
 They believe that America will take care not to associate Pakistan with India and will deal strictly with the issue of terror
 aisi koi sambhaavna nahin he ki trump pakistan ko antarrashtriya birdari main alag-thalag karne ke pradhanmantri narendra modi ke mansoobon kaa saath denge
 Pakistan's balance will hardly deteriorate
 yusuf yah bhi kehete hai ki america pakistan se uski afgaan niti ko lekar zyada naakhush he
 Trump has not yet revealed his intentions about Afghanistan
 ek visheshgy ne majaak kiya ki unki najaron kaa dayera china tak jaakar thahar jaataa he
 However, given their stated intention to wipe out ISIS, they cannot refuse to leave Afghanistan and let it go into Islamic militant hands again
 unka asli imtihaan tab hoga, jab bharat or pakistan ke bich tanaav bad jaae or ek bade hamale ke baad donon paksh simit jang main ulajh jaaen
 In such a situation, will Trump support India or not, especially when both sides are armed with nuclear weapons? This is an important question because Trump's attitude towards nuclear weapons has been negligent
 unhone japan or dakshin korea ko parmaanu hathiyaar banane dene kii baat kahi he, taaki america ko or zyada parmaanu hathiyaar banane kii jarurat na rahe
 Others argue that Trump will be reluctant to use military power unless he sees any direct benefit for America
 aise main ve takaraav ke kshetron or rishton main or zyada sulah-safai par jor denge
 If this happens, then the apprehensions and doubts about his childhood will be dispelled and his hopes will be replaced
 trump ke liye jindagi main jeetna sabase ahm cheez he
 This will have to be kept in mind even more when dealing with people not only American but also around the world

 Shiv Sena has said that no tree will be allowed to be cut in the saw

 Citing a media report on Thursday, 'shivaasna is about to cut 1000 trees', Amrita Fadnavis, wife of Devendra Fadnavis, strongly attacked the Shiv Sena and said that the Shiv Sena can cut the tree at its convenience, or if the tree gets cut when it gets commissioned
