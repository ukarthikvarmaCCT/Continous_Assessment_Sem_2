 On October 10 this year, the court warned of punitive action for not providing the original documents to the land office if the office was ignored
 agle hi din yani 11 aktubar ko yah aadesh bhoomi karyaalay main risive ho gaya jisaki copy india today ke paas he
 On November 27, a month and a half after the court order reached the office, India Today asked the land teaching officer Sribanta about not sending the documents, his reply was, "I have been posted in Faizabad for the last one year

 Twice Acquisition of One Land On March 20, 1992, the Tourism Department leased 43 acres of land acquired as Ram Katha Park to Ramjanma Bhoomi Nyas for 99 years at the rate of Re 1 per annum
 iske baad vibhaag ne sabhi bhumidhar pariwaron ko patr bhejkar suchit kiya ki ab vibhaag ke paas koi jameen nahin he
 On 6 December this year, the Babri Masjid was demolished and a month later, on 7 January 1993, the Central Government issued an ordinance called "certain Areas of Ayodhya Act-1993" and acquired a total of 67 acres of land including Ramkatha Park
 ek peedit rajitram bataate hai, ‘‘ek hi jameen kaa duusari baar adhigrahan hone ke baad hamaare saamne duvidha aa padi ki ham muaavja rajya sarkaar se len ki centre sarkaar se
 After the claim for compensation was made, the Central Government set up a Commissioner's Court to decide the ownership of the land
 janvari, 1997 ko ayukta court ne kaha ki centre sarkaar ne adhigrahit jameen rajya sarkaar se lee he na ki kisi parivaar se
 In this case, the central government is not responsible for compensation

 shaayad netaaon ko bharosa ho gaya he ki inke vot se unka kuch bigadgaye vaala nahin
 The launch of Chandrayaan-2, the second moon mission of the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), has been halted due to technical reasons
 launch se 56
 The countdown to Chandrayaan-2 was stopped 24 minutes earlier
 15 july ko tadake 2
 At 51, Chandrayaan-2 was to be launched with GSLV-MK3, the country's most powerful Bahubali rocket
 isro ke vishwast sutron ke mutabik jis samay countdown roka gaya, use dekhte hue lagata he ki cryogenic ingine or chandrayan-2 ko jodne vaale launch whical main launch ke liye sahi dabaav nahin ban rahaa tha
 Hence the launch was postponed
 launch rokane ke baad isro vaigyanik ye pataa karne kii koshish kar rahe hai ki launch se pehle ye takneekee khami kahaan se ai
 ISRO scientists are making every effort to launch Chandrayaan-2 within four days or else it will be delayed for three months
 chand abhi dur he
 
 
 This is the reason behind the postponement of Chandrayaan-2 at the last minute
 The technical flaw was in the launch vehicle, not in the GSLV-MK3 rocket or Chandrayaan
 isro's trusted source said that the flaw is not in the rocket or Chandrayaan-2
 jo khami ai he vah jieselvi-emke3 ke cryogenic ingine or chandrayan-2 ko jodne vaale launch whical main ai
 a preliminary investigation found a lack of pressure leaks in the launch vehicle
 isliye ab rocket ke sabhi hisson ko alag-alag karke jaanch kii jaaegi
 Chandrayaan-2 will be kept in the same condition as it is now
 rocket ko alag karke jaanch karne main kaaphi samay lagegaa
 Those 11 big occasions when ISRO surprised the whole world with its strength
 
 
 jaanate hai ki lonching rokane ke baad kis tarah kii jaanch prakriya se gujaregaa isro1
 First the fuel will be emptied from the rocket
 Now the scientists will start the process of extracting fuel from all phases of GSLV rocket
 ise difuling kehete hai
 This process is complex and dangerous, but ISRO scientists have done it before
 isliye koi dikkat nahin aegi
 This includes boosters, first stage, second stage and cryogenic engines
 in sabhi main bharaa gaya eendhan nikaala jayega
 The most important of these is liquid oxygen and hydrogen extracted from cryogenic engines
 kyonki inhen mines 156 degree celsius par rakhana hota he
 Since the rocket is under open skies, the temperature keeps fluctuating, so such flammable fuels will soon be evacuated
 2
 The rocket will be separated from Chandrayaan-2, the first GSLV-MK3 rocket will be separated from Chandrayaan-2 after fuel extraction
 is prakriya ko rocket distacking kehete hai
 So that the entire moon mission can be properly investigated
 kya chand par maanav basti ban paaegi? Chandrayaan-2 se kya he ummid3
 Then an analysis committee will be formed, which will find technical flaws, an analysis team of scientists from different centers of ISRO will be formed to check the technical flaws of Chandrayaan-2
 yah team puure jieselvi rocket or launch whical kii jaanch karegi
 When the computer stopped the launch process, the scheduled automated launch schedule would be seen just before that time
 phir us khami kii physical jaanch hogi
 It will be improved
 iske baad rocket, launch whical or chandrayan-2 se sambandhit sabhi jaruri test waapas se kiye jaaenge
 4
 waapas agali taarikh kaa elaan hoga, rocket or chandrayan-2 kii essembling hogisabhi jaruri test karne ke baad lonching kii agali taarikh ghoshit kii jaaegi
 Subsequently, ISRO scientists will re-assemble the GSLV-MK3 rocket and Chandrayaan-2
 computer main dobaaraa launch shedul daalaa jayega
 So that the entire system of launching will come to the computer before re-launch
 20 se 24 ghante yaa usase zyada kaa countdown phir se shuru kiya jayega
 After the countdown starts, the computer will again check the entire automated launch schedule process
 sab thik rahaa to launch hoga nahin to ise phir roka ja saktaa he
 From the soldier of the border to the farmer of the farm, how ISRO is helpful for everyone
 ISRO may launch in October
 It will take a lot of time to separately test the GSLV-MK3 and improve the technical flaws
 agar vaigyanik puraa prayaas karne ke baad bhi chaar dinon ke andar launch nahin kar pate to agle kuch hafte chandrayan kii lonching sambhav nahin he
 The next launch window will come in October
 launch windo vah upyukt samay hota he jab prithvi se chand kii duuri kam hoti he or prithvi ke chaaron taraf chakkar lagane vaale upgrahon se takaraane kii sambhaavna behad kam hoti he
 Chandrayaan-2, know-why and how important isro's mission will be done in October, the launching mission window of Moon mission will be decided by isro's Space Physics Lab at Trivandrum
 aglaa launch windo 10 oktober se 26 oktober ke bich ho saktaa he
 Because during this time the distance of the moon from the Earth averaged 3
 61 lakh kimi hoti he
 If the launch of Chandrayaan-2 was successful on July 15, it would be around 3
 84 lakh kimi kii yatra kerani padati
 That is, about 23 thousand km more distance had to be traveled

 jahaan janvari 2015 main kaccha tel 48 dollar prati bairal par thi, janvari 2016 aate-aate yah 30 dollar ke neeche pahunch gai
 It is believed that the day is not far when crude oil will become cheaper than a bottle of mineral water and prices will break down to $ 20 per barrel

 Now once again, crude oil is showing a strong trend in the international market

 Market experts believe that there is a possibility of some consensus in the oil producing countries, so the prices will get stronger in the coming days

 By the end of 2016, the Organization of Crude Producing Countries OPEC has decided to reduce production from next month
 isse antarrashtriya bazaar main crude ke daam 5 din main 18 fisadi tak uchhal gaye hai
 It is believed that the phase of cheap petrol and diesel in major crude oil importing countries around the world, including India, is now over
 lihaaja 2017 ke pehle chah maheene main gharelu bazaar main petrol ke daam 80 rupye tak pahunch sakate hai

 Now after the mutual agreement between these countries, this trend of decline has stopped

 kuch media reports main is baat kaa bhi zikr kiya gaya he ki is jhadap main kuch log ghayal bhi hue hai
 However, the local administration and police have not confirmed this
 kisi ke hataahat hone kii koi khabar abhi tak saamne nahin ai he
 The dispute within the jail increased so much that even the deputy commissioner of Srinagar, the SP of the area and other officials were asked to intervene
 central jail main maahaul ko shant karaane ke liye kai varisht police adhikariyon or siarpief kii atirikt companiyon ko tainaat kiya gaya he
 Officials say that circumstances are now under control
 kuch media reports main yah bhi kaha ja rahaa he ki is hai security central jail main kaidiyon or jail prashasan main bhi marpet hui he
 During this time, the prisoners have also tried to escape from the jail
 kuch media reports main yah bhi kaha gaya he ki jail ke bheetar marpet kii khabar isliye ai kyonki jail main puraane barrack system ko lagu kiya ja rahaa he
 The Srinagar Central Jail is one of the most susceptible jails in the country

 The Maratha Reservation Movement in Maharashtra has become the neck of the government of Devendra Fadnavis
 agle saal hone vaale loksabhaa or vidhansabha chunaav se pehle rajya main uthi maratha aarakshan kii maang ne bijepi ke liye bhi musiibat khadi kar di he
 Even if the Fadnavis government wishes to implement it, then the resentment of the OBC community will have to be raised, while other states ruled by the BJP may also raise such a demand
 isi ke maddenjar party is maamle par puri tarah se khamoshi akhriyaar kiye hue he
 Let us know that Maratha society has been demanding 16 percent reservation in education and government jobs for a long time
 rajya sarkaar ne haal hi main 72 hajaar padon par bahaali kaa vigyaapan nikaala he, jinamenmaratha samudaay apane liye aarakshanki maang ko lekar sadak par utarkar andolan kar rahaa he
 The Maratha Kranti Morcha has commanded the movement
 mumbai main najar aa rahe binar or poster maratha kranti morcha dwaara hi lagaae gaye hai
 It clearly states that the BJP could not complete the century in Gujarat
 ishaara saaf he, agar maharashtra main maraathon ko aarakshan nahin diya gaya to agle chunaav main rajya main 50 kaa aankada bhi cross nahin hoga
 The BJP currently has 122 seats out of the total 288 seats in the state
 maratha aarakshan andolan kii chetavanee kaa matlab saaf he kifadenvis sarkatiogar inaki maangon ko puraa nahin karti he to aagaamee loksabhaa or vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi ke khilaaf voting ho sakati he
 Marathas constitute 28 to 33 percent of the population in the state
 maharashtra kii 48 loksabhaa siton main se 20 se 22 siten or vidhansabha kii 288 siton main se 80 se 85 siton par maratha vot nirnaayak mana jaataa he
 However, BJP understands that Marathas are not its traditional voters
 marathaon kii pehali pasand ensipi he, uske baad shivasena or tisare number par congress aati he
 While the original vote of BJP is OBC community
 aise main fadanvis sarkaar maratha aarakshan kii maang ko maanakar obisi samudaay ko naaraaz nahin karnaa chaahati he
 Because if the Marathas were given reservation, then they would have to give it from the OBC quota
 rajya kii aabaadi main obisi 52 fisadi he
 It is difficult for Fadnavis government to give reservation beyond the 50 per cent prescribed by the Supreme Court
 aise main agar sarkaar ne obisi ke liye tay 27 fisadi cote main hi maraathon ko shaamil kiya, to rajya main ek alag obisi andolan shuru ho jayega
 The OBC community is against any change in the reservation
 aise main raajnneetik taur par maraathon ke saath puri tarah khadaa hona bijepi ko apane liye mufeed nahin dikhataa he
 This is exactly the same situation as the BJP had on the demand for Patel reservation in Gujarat, where too the BJP got caught in the Patel vs OBC affair
 gauratlab he ki maharashtra main pichhali congress sarkaar ne maraathon ko aarakshan se judaa bill vidhansabha main paas kar diya tha, lekin court ne is par roak laga di thi
 The court had sought a report from the Backward Classes Commission on the economic and social status of the Maratha society
 pichley saal bhi maratha samudaay aarakshan kii maang ko lekar andolan ke liye sadak par utraa tha
 After this, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis did not directly accept the demand for reservation, but had said to take important steps to move forward in that direction
 siem fadanvis ne vidhansabha main kaha ki maratha aarakshan kii maang ko pichhadaa varg ayog ko refer kar diya gaya he, jo marathaon ko aarakshan dene ke aadhaar or sambhaavnaaon kaa adhyayan karegaa
 However, the commission has not yet submitted its report
 aarakshan kii maang ko lekar ensipi or congress khulkar marathaon ke saath hai
 The Shiv Sena accompanies the movement behind the curtain

 The Gujarat government will now issue identity cards to Dalits who remove leather from dead animals
 rajya sarkaar ke saamaajik nyaay or adhikaar vibhaag ne ye faisla kiya he
 After the beating of Dalits in Una Tehsil last year, the Dalits of the state announced that they will no longer work to raise dead animals
 aise charmkaaron kii raksha ke liye sarkaar ne ye idi-card jari karne kaa elaan kiya he
 In order to protect the Dalits, I-CARD Gujarat's Social Justice Rights Minister Atmaram Parmar says that the task of raising dead animals is a question of livelihood for thousands of Dalits
 ye log swatchta banaae rakhane main ahm yogadan dete hai
 Therefore identity cards will help these people to carry out this work without any problem

 In the case of intimate scenes, 'dedh Ishqiya' has overtaken the first film 'ishqiya'
 aisa kaha ja rahaa he ki abhinayta arshad varsi ne apni sayebhinetri huma kuraishi ke saath kuch behad antarang drishy filmaae hai
 Even Madhuri Dixit has shown great immunity in such scenes with Naseeruddin Shah
 jinhone teen saal pehle abhishek choudhary kii ishkia dekhi he unki yaadon main abhi bhi arshad or vidya baalan ke bich filmaae gaye vaastavik se lagate antarang drishy taaja honge
 But according to a source related to the film, Huma and Arshad have crossed all limits while filming intimate scenes for 'dedh Ishqiya'
 itnaa hi nahin, 'dedh ishkia' se filmon main vaapasi karne vaali maadhuri ne bhi nasiruddin ke saath kuch antarang drishy filmaayen hai
 Director Abhishek Chaubey said, "at the beginning of the film, we shot romantic and intimacy scenes
 ve drishy bahut hi khubasurat ban pade hai, lekin main kahana chaahunga ki isamen maadhuri kaa charitra 'ishkia' main vidya dwaara nibhaae gaye kirdaar se bahut alag he
 Abhishek further added, Madhuri plays the role of a begum living in a palace in Lucknow
 chunki yah film bhi 'ishkia' ke bare main he to hamane ek baar phir se prem evam romance ke vibhinn pahaluon kii padtaal kii he
 The relationship between Madhuriji and Naseer Saab in this film is completely different from the relationship between Vidya and Arshad in Ishqiya
 abhishek aage bataate hai, vidya dwaara nibhaae gaye antarang drishy jahaan behad vaastavik or moulik the, vahiin naseer saab ke saath pranay drishyon ko maadhuri ne bahut hi garimapurna tareeke se nibhaayaa he

 unhone bataaya ki ek duniya arshad or naseer saab kii he, jo pehali film main nibhaae gaye unke charitron kii hi aage kii kahani he

 nirdeshak abhishek choube ne bataaya, film kii shuruyaat main hi hamane romantic evam antarangta vaale drishyon ko filma liya
 Those scenes have become very beautiful, but i would like to say that Madhuri's character in this is very different from Vidya's character in 'ishqiya'
 abhishek ne aage bataaya, film main maadhuri ne lakhanu ke ek mahal main rahane vaali ek begum kii bhoomika nibhaai he
 Since this film is also about Ishqiya, we have once again examined various aspects of love and romance
 is film main maadhuriji or naseer saab ke bich jo sambandh he, wo 'ishkia' main vidya or arshad ke bich ke sambandh se bilkul alag he
 Abhishek further adds that while the intimate scenes played by Vidya were very real and original, Prannoy scenes with Naseer Saab are played by Madhuri in a very dignified manner
 abhishek ne bataaya ki unhone 'dedh ishkia' main do tarah kii duniya or bhashaa kii rachana kii he
 He told that one world is of Arshad and Naseer Saab, which is the story of his characters played in the first film
 film main rachi gai duusari duniya maadhuri kii kuleen gharaane vaali vaibhavshaalee duniya he
 Shayari and Mushayars are used in the film
 lekin film main arshad dwaara nibhaayaa gaya ganvaar charitra bhi he
 Huma Qureshi plays Madhuri's friend and confidant in this film
 abhishek ne bataaya, huma, maadhuri ke saath kaam karne ke liye bahut utsahit thim
 He played the role of Kannis, a confidant of Madhuri
 film main maadhuri ke saath nibhaae gaye unke drishy bahut khaas hai
 Ever since Kangana Ranaut was chosen for the character Huma, i was in a dilemma ever since
 mujhe ekadam nahin pataa tha ki kya hone vaala he
 The comments abhishek ne aage bataaya, main huma ko 'ek thi dian' kii shooting ke samay se jaanata hum
 Eventually Huma became my right choice and i could not stop myself from admiring her for choosing me
 is film main huma kaa kirdaar kai tarah se sabase jatil he
 Now only the last scene of 'dedh Ishqiya' is yet to be filmed
 film ke janvari, 2014 main relies hone kii sambhaavna he

 bihar board ne intermediat pariksha main top karne vaale chaatro kii parikshafal kii jaanch ke aadesh de die gaye hai
 On Monday, Aaj Tak showed the reality of the students topping the Intermediate, how they do not even have basic knowledge of their subject
 is khabar ke baad shiksha vibhaag main hadakamp much gaya he ki aakhir itani nigaraanee ke baavjood aise bachche kaise top kar gaye
 At the same time, former professor of Vishundev Rai College of Vaishali has made many important revelations
 chaatro kii maujuudagi main phir se copy kii hogi jaanchbihar intermediat ke top karne vaali rubi kumari ko apane vishay tak kii jaankaree na hona 'political' sinans ko 'prodical' science kahana yaa phir political science main khaanaa banane ke bare main padhaaye jane jaisi jaankaree rakhane vaali chaatra par sankat ke badal chaane lage hai
 The board has started the process of checking the copy of that student again in front of her
 is dauraan uske handriting kii jaanch bhi kii jaaegi
 The same process will also be adopted on students who have topped in science
 copy jaanch kii prakriya isliye chaatro ke saamne ho rahi he kyonki ashanka he ki inaki copy kisi or ne likhaa he
 The first copy was examined in Patna, Amarendra Kumar Singh, who worked as a professor in Vishunadev Rai College, says that the copy of this college was brought here again from the evaluation center
 yah kaam board kii mileebhagat ke bina nahin ho saktaa he
 According to the professor, a copy of all intermediate schools and colleges in Vaishali district was sent to the evaluation centers in Kaimur district, only the copy of Vishundev Rai College was sent to the school at Rajendra Nagar in Patna
 haalanki board kii daleel he ki is college ke pehle ke itihaas ko dekhte hue is par vishesh najar rakhane ke liye isko patna main hi rakhaa gaya
 But Amarendra Kumar Singh says that the people associated with this college in Patna got everything done behind the scenes in their own right
 college ke purv professor ne khole kai rajvishundev raay college kii sthapana se 2011 tak usee college main professor rahane vaale amarendra kumaar singh ne kaha ki college main padhai likhaai kii koi suvidha nahin he, balki paise ke hisaab se grading hoti he jitna paisa do utana number paao
 For this, grades A, B, c are maintained in the college
 is college main adhiktar baahar ke chaatr padhate hai
 Many students do coaching at Kota or elsewhere and take exams from here
 vahiin number ke aadhaar par niojit shikshak ke taur par naukari bhi mil jaati he isliye yahaan chaataadhik se adhik paisadhene ke liye taiyaar hote hai
 At the same time, this college also attracts students with good board penetration
 pichley saal is college ke 215 chaatro kii copy ek hi handriting se likhi gai thi
 The matter was investigated by the Bihar Board
 jaanch main maamla sahi paaya gaya tha
 There was also a proposal to blacklist this college, but the college not only managed the case but also made its college top again
 sisitivi kii nigaraanee main hui thi parikshahalanki is baar kii pariksha main is college par prashasan kii vishesh najar thi
 The examination center was heavily monitored, CCTV cameras were installed to check the cheating
 patna kemulyankankendra par bhi sisitivi camera tha
 The sealed mark table from the evaluation center was opened in the presence of senior officers of the board
 phir gadabadi kahaan hui ye jaanch kaa vishay he
 The college premier kid Rai is sure about the matter
 unka kahana he ki bacchon kii pratibha par bekaar shaq kiya ja rahaa he
 BJP demanded action in the meantime, the opposition is very serious about this matter
 bijepi ke senior netaa susheel kumaar modi ne kaha ki pehle bhi is college par aarope lage, uski jaanch hui lekin karrwai kuch nahin hui, is baar is maamle ko gambhirtha se lekar jaanch ke saath-saath karrwai bhi honi chahie

 Pakistan is considered to be a team in world cricket whose performance lacks consistency
 kisi khaas din yah duniya kii sheersh tiimon ko bhi aasaani se haraa detii he to kabhi doum darje kii team se haar jaati he
 In terms of bowling, this team is considered very good but batting has been its big weakness
 haal ke maichon main zyaadaatar baar ballebaajon ke kamjor pradarshan ke kaaran hi ise haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa he
 Two young batsmen of the Pakistan team, Umar Akmal and Ahmed Shehzad, are rated highly but their lack of discipline and lack of consistency in performance is considered to be their weakness
 is kaaran in donon ko prashansakon kii aalochana kaa bhi shikaar bananaa padataa he
 At one time both these batsmen were compared with India's Virat Kohli but today Virat is one of the top batsmen in the world in every format while Omar and Shehzad are in and out of the Pakistan team
 vaise, umr akmal ne unki tulana viraat kohli se karne vaale logon ko aade haath liya he
 He said that my comparison with Virat Kohli is not fair because the captain of Team India batting at number 3
 umr ne vijaden india se kaha, 'log meri tulana viraat kohli se karte hai lekin yah kisi tarah se thik nahin nahin he
 It is a matter of batting order
 apane kariyar kii shuruyaat se hi viraat number 3 par batting karte hai jabaki main number 6 par ballebaaji karata hum
 Let me bat at number 3 and compare Kohli to number 6 again
 ' 26 saal ke is pakistani ballebaaj ne kaha ki kohli or pakistani ballebaaj babar ajam kii tulana ko adhik tarksangat mana ja saktaa he kyonki ye donon ek hi batting pojishan (number 3) par aate hai
 Omar said, 'compare Virat to Babar Azam, who is consistently doing well at number 3
 ve achche form hai or aap viraat kii babar se tulana kar sakate hai
 It is worth noting that Omar Akmal, younger brother of Pakistani wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal, has scored only two centuries in 116 odis while Virat has scored 27 centuries in 179 matches
 tii20 main bhi viraat kaa record umr se bahut behatar he
 In Pakistan's test team, Omar has been constantly in and out
 unhone ab tak mahaj 16 test match hi khele hai or isamen keval ek shatak banaaya he
 By the way, Omar Akmal has slammed people comparing him to Virat Kohli
 unhone kaha ki viraat kohli se meri tulana uchit nahin he kyonki team india ke captain number 3 par batting karte hai
 Omar told Wisden India, 'people compare me to Virat Kohli but it is not good in any way
 yah batting kram kaa maamla he
 From the very beginning of his career, Virat is batting at number 3 while i bat at number 6
 mujhe number 3 par batting karne dijie or kohli ko number 6 par phir hamaari tulana kiijie
 The 26-year-old Pakistani batsman said that the comparison of Kohli and Pakistani batsman Babar Azam can be considered more rational as they both fall on the same batting position (number 3)
 umr ne kaha, 'viraat kii babar ajam se tulana kiijie jo number 3 par lagaataar acha kar rahe hai
 They are good form and you can compare Virat to Babur
 ' gauratlab he ki pakistani wicketiper kamran akmal ke chote bhai umr akmal ne 116 vanade main keval do shatak banaae hai jabaki viraat 179 maichon main 27 shatak jamaa chuke hai
 Virat's record in T20 is much better than Omar
 pakistan kii test team main umr lagaataar andar-baahar hote rahe hai
 He has played only 16 Test matches so far and has scored only one century in it

 (input bhashaa se) (from input language) chhapra mid-de mile haadase ko lekar centre sarkaar kii ore se jari ek report ne mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ke daavon kii kalai khul gai he
 It clearly states that if the state government was conscious, then the lives of the nine-year-old would not go
 centre kii is report main saaf-saaf likhaa he ki ghatana vaale din bacchon ke manaa karne ke baavjood unhen khaanaa khaane ke liye majaboor kiya gaya
 In the report on the claim of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, who has claimed good governance in Bihar, so many questions have been raised that Nitish may find it difficult to answer
 centre ke jwoint secretary amarjit singh ne apni report main nitish ke sushasan kii pole khol di he
 Highlights of the report- The children were given smelly and bitter food on the day of the incident
 - bacchon ne pehle cor ke baad hi khaanaa khaane se manaa kar diya tha
 - The children were forcibly scolded and fed
 - prisimple minaa devi ne apane pati kii dukaan se hi saamaan kharida tha
 Despite being compulsory, Meena Devi did not take the food test
 report main ye sawaal uthaaya gaya he ki ye kaise hota rahaa ki prisimple apane pati kii dukaan se hi saamaan leti rahi or kisi sarkari afasar ne sawaal tak nahin uthaaya
 Why was no step taken for reform even when the Center had already warned? The law of Principal Meena Devi will decide the law but Nitish government also cannot escape its responsibility
 centre kii report aage ye kahati he ki ghatana ke baad sthaneey prashasan or afasaron ne ghanton tak kuch nahin kiya
 According to the report, when the children started getting sick immediately after eating, the principal ran away
 biimaar bacchon ko dekhne vaala koi nahin tha
 Government officials sat hand in hand
 sthaneey dispenceri main doctor bhi nahin tha
 If the administration had acted, the lives of the children could have been saved
 report saaf kahati he
 This incident is the result of sheer negligence
 yojana ke amal main kai kamiyaan he
 There are 70 thousand schools in Bihar but not even a school building in 18 thousand
 mid-de mile khule main or gandi jagahon par banataa he
 In most places there is no arrangement for keeping grains
 centre kii report se saaf he ki agar nitish sarkaar mid-de mile yojana sahi tareeke se lagu karti to ye haadasa nahin hota
 And even after the accident, if the government officials had taken some steps, then precious lives could have been saved? salmaan khan kii aane vaali film 'tubalite' ke tiger kaa logon ko bahut dinon se intjaar tha

 Waheeda feels that it is not right to make a film on someone's life as it reveals a lot of personal life of an artist, amid reports of films made on the life of actor-filmmaker Gurudutt and singer-actor Kishore Kumar
 wahidaa ne ek saakshaatkaar main kaha, ‘‘gurudutt or kishor kumaar ke jivan main bahut se utaar-chadhaav aae
 There was a lot of grief in his life
 mujhe lagata he ki yah film traasadee sabit ho sakati he
 It will be as if we are providing their personal information
 mujhe nahin lagata ki yah ek acha vichaar he
 '' bollywood main ek anya chalan he puraani charchit filmon ko aaj ke andaaj main banane kaa
 The basic sense of the story remains the same in such films, but Waheeda is also not in favor of it
 wahidaa ne kaha, ‘‘main rimek filmon main yakeen nahin rakhti
 i think the original films are somewhat different and no one can make a film like the original
 agar ve aisa karte bhi hai to phir donon main tulanaayen hoti rahengi jo ki acha vichaar nahin he

 Waheeda agrees on this
 wahidaa ne kaha, ‘‘mujhe nishchit taur par yah lagata he ki film industry main hone ke liye yah sabase acha samay he
 Earlier films were made on the fixed format of love story, family drama
 lekin aaj alag-alag tarah kii filmein banaai ja rahi hai or darshakon dwaara inhen sweekaar kiya ja rahaa he

 '' wahidaa dakshin africa bhartiya film va televijan puraskaar (safta) kii vaishvik doot hai

 wahidaa ne kaha, ‘‘puraskaar apana aakarshan kho chuke hai
 Today prizes are distributed for anything
 hamaare samay main vijeta ke naam kii ghoshnaa sunne se log ghabrahat main nakhun chabane lag jate the
 We were always eager to know whether we would be winners or not
 puraskaar milane kaa vah anubhav ab puri tarah kho gaya he
 '' Comments safta se judaav ke kaaran wahidaa pradarshit hui filmon or unamem di gai prastutiyon ke prati sajag rahati hai

 Waheeda said in an interview, "there were many ups and downs in the lives of Gurudutt and Kishore Kumar
 unke jivan main kaaphi dukh tha
 i think this film can prove to be a tragedy
 yah aisa hoga ki maano ham unki nijee jaankariyaan uplabdh karvaa rahe hai

 ab itane ghumaavdaar maamle ko turant samaj janaa yaa kisi ko chor bataakar pakad lenaa na to aasaan he na hi uchit he
 Now here is another question which i understand and which i want to put before you
 jaise mosac phonseka naam kii kanoonee salaah dene vaali company ke sabhi graahak kaise ho sakate hai
 The wealthy industrialist following the rules also seeks Fonseca's help in building or buying the company
 drug mafia bhi apane kaale paise ko jamaa karne ke liye usee company kii madad letaa he
 The bank robbery gang also helps Fonseca to find the money
 aisa prathit hota he ki phonseka ek ghat he jahaan pani pine ke liye bakrii bhi aati he, hiran bhi aata he or baagh bhi aata he
 Where the crocodile also lives is cool
 kya phonseka jaisi company kaa astitv aatank or tarah-tarah ke bhrashtachar se jujh rahi duniya ke liye chunauti nahin he
 If no leader's name has come up, why is there no restlessness about the existence of companies like Fonseca
 phir to ye 370 patrakaron kaa saal bhar tak ek karod dastavezon kaa padhanaa ek bekaar abhyaas ghoshit kar dena chahie
 But if it was so useless, then when the Government of India enacted a law, then how did 2000 crore rupees come back for fear of it kaash ye bhi pataa hota ki ye paisa panama se hi aayaa he yaa mokama se aayaa he
 Mokama is in Bihar and the law i am referring to relates to the property that exists abroad
 indian express ne syria ke sandarbh main ek khabar chhaapi he jisase is masale ko samajhane main shaayad kuch madad mil sakati he
 There has been a civil war in Syria for six years, but this civil war is also a kind of small world war because it is a unique civil war of its own in which Russia is also dropping bombs, America, France, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Australia all together
 Dropping bombs
 samaadhaan hona to dur duniya ko ek or nae aatanki sanghathan iesas kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he or bataaya jaataa he ki is laghu vishwayuddh sah grihayuddh main dhai lakh se adhik log maare gaye hai or lakhon log syria se visthapit ho gaye hai
 If you remember, in November 2015, Russia's President Putin alleged that he has the names of 40 countries from which the terrorist organization ISIS receives money
 vaise putin kaa bhi naam panama papers main aayaa he ki ve kathith rup se apane paise ko chhipaane ke liye mozaaq phonseka kii madad le rahe the
 Now remember the speeches of fighting the war against terror and see the reality of the network of companies helping the militant organization from banned terrorist countries
 aatank se ladane ke naam par aapako jo jhansa diya ja rahaa he wo khel kuch kuch samaj aa saktaa he
 The President of Syria has also been accused in this war and his government has imposed many kinds of restrictions on his government
 iske baad bhi kai companiyaan siria ko tel or gas kii supplai kar rahi hai jisase uske ladaaku vimaan ud rahe hai
 The Panama Papers show that many companies have continued to supply Syria even after the ban by creating a network of their own
 aisi teen companiyon par america ke tregeri department ke offis of fahrren asets control (oefasi) ne pabandi bhi lagaai
 Law firm Mossack Fonseca also worked for one of these companies
 mosac phonseka ke ek pravaktaa ne international concortium of invastegative jarnlists (ICIJ) ko bataaya ki unki form bainkon or duusari lau ferms jaise bichauliyon ke zarie hi un graahakon kii samiksha karti he or unka becoground check karti he jinhen wo mosac phonseka ke paas bhejtaa he
 Mossack Fonseca has worked with close to 334 people and companies under the restrictions of the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US Treasury Department
 record kehete hai ki pashchim asia main sakriy aatankwaadiyon or yuddh aparaadhiyon ke sandigdh financers ke liye farzi companiyaan banaakar mosac phonseka ne paisa kamaaya he
 In addition, Mossack Fonseca also played a role in building shell companies for drug mafia in Mexico, Guatemala and Eastern Europe, atom bomb makers in Iran and North Korea and arms dealers in South Africa
 agar ye baat sahi he to kya aap mosac phonseka jaisi company ke hone or usase sabake rishte yaa usase suvidha lene kaa khatra samajhane main dikkat nahin honi chahie
 What kind of honest and gentle company is this that makes the company open even for terrorist organization and gives clarification for the drug mafia and on the basis of rules that we are nothing
 bank ko apane graahakon kii samiksha kerani hoti he wo jane kis kis ke liye company khulwaane main hame clin chit dete hai
 Wow ray world
 to aapako kya ye samaj aa rahaa he ki bank or vakil milakar kya gul khilaa rahe hai
 This disclosure showed that Swiss banking company UBS and Panama's Mossack Fonseca had been in a profitable partnership with each other for years
 UBS main aise graahak the jinhen apane paise chhupaae rakhane ke liye duusare deshon main farzi companiyaan yani shell companiyaan chahie thim
 Mossack Fonseca was an expert in creating such companies
 lekin 2010 main UBS ko dar ho gaya ki america main us par tex chori or hawala ke maamle chal sakate hai
 The directors of UBS Bank then followed up with the idea of shell going out of business
 28 sitambar 2010 ko switsraland ke jurikh main ek baithak main kaaphi tanaav ho gaya jisamen UBS ne kaha ki sikret accounts ke peeche shell companiyon ke maalikon kii pahchaan ke liye mosac phonseka zimmedaar he, bank nahin
 Remember what Mossack Fonseca is saying right now
 wo kah rahi he ki khatarnaak graahakon kii pahchaan ke liye bank zimmedaar hai wo nahin
 So both seem to be playing football
 mosac phonseka ke karmchaaree Dieter Buchholz ne kaha ki unki form ko nahin pataa ki UBS ke graahakon ke liye banaai gai kuch companiyon ke asli maalik koun hai kyonki bank ne isaki jaankaree nahin di
 The comments 500 se zyaada bainkon, unki sahyogi companiyon or unki shakhaon ne mosac phonseka ke saath qareeb 15,600 shell companiyaan register kii thim
 Ubis Bank later dropped out of the game, changing its policies
 ham or aap bainkon par kitna bharosa karte hai
 Mossack Fonseca opened fake companies ranging from terrorist organizations to drug mafia
 amiron ke paise thikaane lagane main madad kii
 500 banks had links with that Fonseca
 kya isliye hangaamaa nahin he ki chand haathon main puunji jamaa hone ke is khel ko koi kharaab nahin karnaa chahta
 Is this the game that causes one percent people to own 90 percent of their property? poonjeevaad main agar sabko baraabar kaa chance miltaa he to sara palada ek pratisht kii taraf hi kyon hai
 Isn't this whole game against the basic principle of capitalism
 vaise mul siddhant kya he ye main bhi thik se nahin jaanata magar samajhane or aapse baat karne ke liye kah rahaa hum
 Is there peace in India because of the fact that no major leader or party has been named yet or because of the names of industrialists and no one wants to speak against them
 is baat ke baavjood bharat sarkaar ne khabaron ke chhapate hi jaanch ke aadesh de diye, congress ne tamaam kaagazaat ko supreme court ke hawaale karne ke bayaan de diye magar iske baad or kya ho saktaa tha
 However, among the names published by the Indian Express newspaper, Amitabh Bachchan and lawyer Harish Salve have come clean
 somvaar ko india bulls, dlef or aishwarya raay bachchan ne bhi safai de di thi
 Amitabh Bachchan said in the cleanliness, 'I do not know of any companies the media has named
 main in companiyon main kabhi nideshak nahin rahaa
 My name may have been misused
 maine apane saare tex diye hai
 What i have earned outside, i have earned within the purview of law and have also given tax as per Indian law
 indian express kii report bhi nahin bataati he ki maine kya gaiyrkanoonee kaam kiya he
 Eminent lawyer Harish Salve said that 'I formed a holding company in 2012 named Crestbright but the company has no assets, its income is zero
 main kanoon ke anusaar 2003 se paisa baahar bhej rahaa hum
 i have invested some money in companies in England and in a US patent
 2014 ke baad se main do jagah tex de rahaa hum, england or bharat main
 i never put money in Crestbait
 ' The same thing is coming out in the cleaning of most people that they opened such companies and invested money under the rules
 par kya ye sawaal ho saktaa he ki duniya main panama yaa british varjin island jaise tex adde kyon hai
 Can we say with a claim that countries like Panama are not denominations of black money around the world
 vahaan par har koi apane apane desh ke niyam ke anusaar hi company kholta he or paise lagaataa he
 According to an estimate, there are 80 such countries and 12 thousand trillion rupees have been kept here
 jo chipa kar rakhe gaye hai or jo duniya bhar main ghoomte rahete hai
 Now it is neither easy nor appropriate to immediately understand such a curved case or catch someone as a thief
 ab yahaan ek or sawaal jo mujhe samaj main aa rahaa he or jo main aapke saamne rakhana chahta hum
 For example, how can a company named Mossack Fonseca have all its customers
 niyamon kaa paalan karne vaala amir udyogpati bhi company banane yaa kareedne main phonseka kii madad letaa he
 The drug mafia also seeks the help of the same company to deposit its black money
 bank luutane vaala giroh bhi paise ko thikaane lagane ke liye phonseka kii madad karata he
 It seems that Fonseca is a ghat where a goat comes to drink water, a deer comes and a tiger
 jahaan magaramchh bhi sustaata rahata he
 Is not the existence of a company like Fonseca a challenge to the world battling terror and various types of corruption
 agar kisi netaa kaa naam nahin aayaa he to phonseka jaisi companiyon ke astitv ko lekar hi bechaini kyon nahin he
 Then these 370 journalists should declare reading one crore documents for a year a useless practice
 par itnaa bekaar hota to bharat sarkaar ne jab ek kanoon banaaya to uske dar se 2000 karod rupaya kaise waapas aa gaya
 i wish i had known that this money came from Panama or from Mokama
 mokama bihar main he or main jis kanoon kii baat kar rahaa hum uskaa sambandh videshon main maujuud sampatti se he
 The Indian Express has published a news report about Syria, which may help to understand this issue
 chah saal se syria main grih yuddh he lekin yah grih yuddh ek tarah se laghu vishwayuddh bhi he kyonki yah apni tarah kaa anokhaa grihayuddh he jisamen rus bhi bam gira rahaa he, america, france, jordan, saudi arab, turki, australia ye sab milakar bam gira rahe hai
 Far from being the solution, the world is facing another new terrorist organization ISIS and it is said that more than two and a half million people have been killed and millions displaced from Syria in this mini world war cum civil war
 aapako yaad ho to november 2015 main rus ke raashtrapati putin ne aarope lagaaya tha ki unke paas 40 deshon ke naam hai jinase aatanki sanghathan iesas ko paisa miltaa he
 Putin has also been named in the Panama Papers for allegedly using the help of Mozak Fonseca to hide his money
 ab aap aatank ke khilaaf yuddh ladane ke bhaashanon ko yaad kiijie or aatanki sanghathan se lekar pratibandhit mulk siria kii madad karne vaali companiyon ke network kii hakeekat ko dekhiye
 The game you are being lied to in the name of fighting terror can make some sense
 is yuddh main siria ke raashtrapati ko bhi aaropee mana gaya he or unki sarkaar par america ne kai prakaar kii pabandi lagaai he
 Even after this, many companies are supplying oil and gas to Syria, which its fighter planes are flying
 panama papers se pataa chalata he ki kai companiyon ne apana ek network banaakar siria ko pambadi ke baad bhi supplai jari rakhi he
 Three such companies were also banned by the US Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)
 inamen se ek company ke liye lau form mosac phonseka ne bhi kaam kiya
 a spokesperson for Mossack Fonseca told the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) that his firm reviews and background checks those clients through intermediaries such as banks and other law firms that it sends to Mossack Fonseca
 america ke tregeri department ke offis of fahrren asets control (oefasi) kii paabandiyon ke daayre main aane vaale qareeb 334 logon or companiyon ke saath mosac phonseka ne kaam kiya he
 The records say that Mossack Fonseca has made money by creating fake companies for suspected financiers of terrorists and war criminals operating in West Asia
 iske alaava mexico, guatemala or purvi europe ke drug maffia, iran or uttar korea main atom bam banane se judi jaankariyaan failaane waalon or dakshin africa ke arms dilers ke liye bhi shell companiyaan banane main mosac phonseka kaa role rahaa
 If this is true, then you should not have any difficulty in understanding the danger of having a company like Mossack Fonseca and relationship with it or taking convenience from it
 ye kisi eemaandaar or sajjan company he jo aatankwaadi sanghathan ke liye bhi company khulavaa detii he or drug mafia ke liye or niyamon ke aadhaar par safai de detii he ki ham to kuch hai hi nahin
 The bank has to review its customers and they give us a clean chit in opening the company for whom
 vaah re duniya
 So do you understand what the banks and lawyers are feeding together? is khulaase se pataa chalaa he ki varshon tak swiss banking company UBS or panama kii mosac phonseka ek duusare ke saath munaafe vaali saajhedaari main raheen
 UBS had customers who needed fake companies, ie shell companies, in other countries to hide their money
 mosac phonseka aisi companiyon ko banane main maahir thi
 But in 2010, UBS feared that it might face tax evasion and hawala cases in the US
 UBS bank ke diarector iske baad shell company ke is kaarobaar se baahar hone kii firaaq main lag gaye
 On 28 September 2010, in a meeting in Zurich, Switzerland, there was considerable tension in which UBS said that Mossack Fonseca is responsible for identifying the owners of shell companies behind the secret accounts, not the bank
 yaad kiijie abhi mosac phonseka kya kah rahi he
 She is saying that banks are not responsible for identifying dangerous customers
 to donon footbal khel rahe hai lagata he
 Dieter Buchholz, an employee of Mossack Fonseca, said his firm did not know who the real owners of some companies created for UBS customers were because the bank did not disclose it
 tippaniyan More than 500 banks, their subsidiaries and their branches had registered about 15,600 shell companies with Mossack Fonseca
 baad main ubis bank is khel se baahar ho gaya, apni nitiyaan badal lee
 How much we and you trust banks
 mosac phonseka ne aatankwaadi sanghathanon se lekar drug mafia ke liye farzi companiyaan khulawaain
 Helped to locate the money of the rich
 us phonseka se 500 bainkon ke rishte rahe
 Is it not a ruckus that no one wants to spoil this game of accumulation of capital in hands? kya yahi wo khel he jiske kaaran ek pratishat logon ke paas 90 fisadi sampatti par kabza he
 If everyone gets an equal chance in capitalism, then why is the whole pan on the side? kya ye sara khel poonjeevaad ke mul siddhant ke khilaaf nahin he
 By the way, i do not even know what the basic principle is, but i am asking you to understand and talk to you
 amitabh bachchan ne safai main kaha, 'media ne jin companiyon kaa naam liya he main kisi ke bare main nahin jaanata
 i have never been a director in these companies
 ho saktaa he ki mere naam kaa galat istemaal hua ho
 i have paid all my taxes
 maine baahar jo kamaaya he wo kanoon ke daayre main hi kamaaya he or bhartiya kanoon ke anusaar tex bhi diya he
 Even the report of Indian Express does not tell what illegal work i have done
 mashhoor vakil harish salve ne kaha ki 'maine 2012 main crestbrit naam se ek holding company banaai thi lekin company ke paas koi sampatti nahin he, isaki aay shunya he
 i have been sending money out of law since 2003
 maine kuch paise england kii companiyon or america ke ek patent main lagaae hai
 Since 2014, i have been paying tax in two places, in England and India
 maine crestbite main kabhi paisa nahin rakhaa
 ' zyaadaatar logon kii safai main yahi baat nikal kar aa rahi he ki unhone niyamon ke tahat aisi companiyaan kholin or paison kaa nivesh kiya
 But can there be a question as to why there are taxports like Panama or British Virgin Islands in the world
 kya ham daawey ke saath kah sakate hai ki panama jaise desh duniya bhar ke kaale dhan ko chhipaane ke adde nahin hai
 Everyone there opens the company and puts money according to the rules of their own country
 ek anumaan ke tahat aise 80 desh hai or yahaan hazaar baarah sau kharab rupee rakhe gaye hai
 Those who are hidden and who roam around the world
 ab itane ghumaavdaar maamle ko turant samaj janaa yaa kisi ko chor bataakar pakad lenaa na to aasaan he na hi uchit he
 Now here is another question which i understand and which i want to put before you
 jaise mosac phonseka naam kii kanoonee salaah dene vaali company ke sabhi graahak kaise ho sakate hai

 to donon footbal khel rahe hai lagata he
 Dieter Buchholz, an employee of Mossack Fonseca, said his firm did not know who the real owners of some companies created for UBS customers were because the bank did not disclose it
 tippaniyan More than 500 banks, their subsidiaries and their branches had registered about 15,600 shell companies with Mossack Fonseca
 baad main ubis bank is khel se baahar ho gaya, apni nitiyaan badal lee
 How much we and you trust banks
 mosac phonseka ne aatankwaadi sanghathanon se lekar drug mafia ke liye farzi companiyaan khulawaain
 Made the money in the whereabouts of the rich 
 us phonseka se 500 bainkon ke rishte rahe
 Is it not a ruckus that no one wants to spoil this game of accumulation of capital in hands? kya yahi wo khel he jiske kaaran ek pratishat logon ke paas 90 fisadi sampatti par kabza he
 If everyone gets an equal chance in capitalism, then why is the whole pan on the side? kya ye sara khel poonjeevaad ke mul siddhant ke khilaaf nahin he
 By the way, i do not even know what the basic principle is, but i am asking you to understand and talk to you
 zyaadaatar logon kii safai main yahi baat nikal kar aa rahi he ki unhone niyamon ke tahat aisi companiyaan kholin or paison kaa nivesh kiya
 But can there be a question as to why there are taxports like Panama or British Virgin Islands in the world
 kya ham daawey ke saath kah sakate hai ki panama jaise desh duniya bhar ke kaale dhan ko chhipaane ke adde nahin hai
 Everyone there opens the company and puts money according to the rules of their own country
 ek anumaan ke tahat aise 80 desh hai or yahaan hazaar baarah sau kharab rupee rakhe gaye hai
 Those who are hidden and who roam around the world
 ab itane ghumaavdaar maamle ko turant samaj janaa yaa kisi ko chor bataakar pakad lenaa na to aasaan he na hi uchit he
 Now here is another question which i understand and which i want to put before you
 jaise mosac phonseka naam kii kanoonee salaah dene vaali company ke sabhi graahak kaise ho sakate hai
 The wealthy industrialist following the rules also seeks Fonseca's help in building or buying the company
 drug mafia bhi apane kaale paise ko jamaa karne ke liye usee company kii madad letaa he
 The bank robbery gang also helps Fonseca to find the money
 aisa prathit hota he ki phonseka ek ghat he jahaan pani pine ke liye bakrii bhi aati he, hiran bhi aata he or baagh bhi aata he
 Where the crocodile also lives is cool
 kya phonseka jaisi company kaa astitv aatank or tarah-tarah ke bhrashtachar se jujh rahi duniya ke liye chunauti nahin he
 If no leader's name has come up, why is there no restlessness about the existence of companies like Fonseca
 phir to ye 370 patrakaron kaa saal bhar tak ek karod dastavezon kaa padhanaa ek bekaar abhyaas ghoshit kar dena chahie
 But if it was so useless, then when the Government of India enacted a law, then how did 2000 crore rupees come back for fear of it kaash ye bhi pataa hota ki ye paisa panama se hi aayaa he yaa mokama se aayaa he
 Mokama is in Bihar and the law i am referring to relates to the property that exists abroad
 indian express ne syria ke sandarbh main ek khabar chhaapi he jisase is masale ko samajhane main shaayad kuch madad mil sakati he
 There has been a civil war in Syria for six years, but this civil war is also a kind of small world war because it is a unique civil war of its own in which Russia is also dropping bombs, America, France, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Australia all together
 Dropping bombs
 samaadhaan hona to dur duniya ko ek or nae aatanki sanghathan iesas kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he or bataaya jaataa he ki is laghu vishwayuddh sah grihayuddh main dhai lakh se adhik log maare gaye hai or lakhon log syria se visthapit ho gaye hai
 If you remember, in November 2015, Russia's President Putin alleged that he has the names of 40 countries from which the terrorist organization ISIS receives money
 vaise putin kaa bhi naam panama papers main aayaa he ki ve kathith rup se apane paise ko chhipaane ke liye mozaaq phonseka kii madad le rahe the
 Now remember the speeches of fighting the war against terror and see the reality of the network of companies helping the militant organization from banned terrorist countries
 aatank se ladane ke naam par aapako jo jhansa diya ja rahaa he wo khel kuch kuch samaj aa saktaa he
 The President of Syria has also been accused in this war and his government has imposed many kinds of restrictions on his government
 iske baad bhi kai companiyaan siria ko tel or gas kii supplai kar rahi hai jisase uske ladaaku vimaan ud rahe hai
 The Panama Papers show that many companies have continued to supply Syria even after the ban by creating a network of their own
 aisi teen companiyon par america ke tregeri department ke offis of fahrren asets control (oefasi) ne pabandi bhi lagaai
 Law firm Mossack Fonseca also worked for one of these companies
 mosac phonseka ke ek pravaktaa ne international concortium of invastegative jarnlists (ICIJ) ko bataaya ki unki form bainkon or duusari lau ferms jaise bichauliyon ke zarie hi un graahakon kii samiksha karti he or unka becoground check karti he jinhen wo mosac phonseka ke paas bhejtaa he
 Mossack Fonseca has worked with close to 334 people and companies under the restrictions of the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US Treasury Department
 record kehete hai ki pashchim asia main sakriy aatankwaadiyon or yuddh aparaadhiyon ke sandigdh financers ke liye farzi companiyaan banaakar mosac phonseka ne paisa kamaaya he
 In addition, Mossack Fonseca also played a role in building shell companies for drug mafia in Mexico, Guatemala and Eastern Europe, atom bomb makers in Iran and North Korea and arms dealers in South Africa
 agar ye baat sahi he to kya aap mosac phonseka jaisi company ke hone or usase sabake rishte yaa usase suvidha lene kaa khatra samajhane main dikkat nahin honi chahie
 What kind of honest and gentle company is this that makes the company open even for terrorist organization and gives clarification for the drug mafia and on the basis of rules that we are nothing
 bank ko apane graahakon kii samiksha kerani hoti he wo jane kis kis ke liye company khulwaane main hame clin chit dete hai
 Wow ray world
 to aapako kya ye samaj aa rahaa he ki bank or vakil milakar kya gul khilaa rahe hai
 This disclosure showed that Swiss banking company UBS and Panama's Mossack Fonseca had been in a profitable partnership with each other for years
 UBS main aise graahak the jinhen apane paise chhupaae rakhane ke liye duusare deshon main farzi companiyaan yani shell companiyaan chahie thim
 Mossack Fonseca was an expert in creating such companies
 lekin 2010 main UBS ko dar ho gaya ki america main us par tex chori or hawala ke maamle chal sakate hai
 The directors of UBS Bank then followed up with the idea of shell going out of business
 28 sitambar 2010 ko switsraland ke jurikh main ek baithak main kaaphi tanaav ho gaya jisamen UBS ne kaha ki sikret accounts ke peeche shell companiyon ke maalikon kii pahchaan ke liye mosac phonseka zimmedaar he, bank nahin
 Remember what Mossack Fonseca is saying right now
 wo kah rahi he ki khatarnaak graahakon kii pahchaan ke liye bank zimmedaar hai wo nahin
 So both seem to be playing football
 mosac phonseka ke karmchaaree Dieter Buchholz ne kaha ki unki form ko nahin pataa ki UBS ke graahakon ke liye banaai gai kuch companiyon ke asli maalik koun hai kyonki bank ne isaki jaankaree nahin di
 The comments 500 se zyaada bainkon, unki sahyogi companiyon or unki shakhaon ne mosac phonseka ke saath qareeb 15,600 shell companiyaan register kii thim
 Ubis Bank later dropped out of the game, changing its policies
 ham or aap bainkon par kitna bharosa karte hai
 Mossack Fonseca opened fake companies ranging from terrorist organizations to drug mafia
 amiron ke paise thikaane lagane main madad kii
 500 banks had links with that Fonseca
 kya isliye hangaamaa nahin he ki chand haathon main puunji jamaa hone ke is khel ko koi kharaab nahin karnaa chahta
 Is this the game that causes one percent people to own 90 percent of their property? poonjeevaad main agar sabko baraabar kaa chance miltaa he to sara palada ek pratisht kii taraf hi kyon hai
 Isn't this whole game against the basic principle of capitalism
 vaise mul siddhant kya he ye main bhi thik se nahin jaanata magar samajhane or aapse baat karne ke liye kah rahaa hum
 It seems that Fonseca is a ghat where a goat comes to drink water, a deer comes and a tiger
 jahaan magaramchh bhi sustaata rahata he
 Is not the existence of a company like Fonseca a challenge to the world battling terror and various types of corruption
 agar kisi netaa kaa naam nahin aayaa he to phonseka jaisi companiyon ke astitv ko lekar hi bechaini kyon nahin he
 Then these 370 journalists should declare reading one crore documents for a year a useless practice
 par itnaa bekaar hota to bharat sarkaar ne jab ek kanoon banaaya to uske dar se 2000 karod rupaya kaise waapas aa gaya
 i wish i had known that this money came from Panama or from Mokama
 mokama bihar main he or main jis kanoon kii baat kar rahaa hum uskaa sambandh videshon main maujuud sampatti se he
 The Indian Express has published a news report about Syria, which may help to understand this issue
 chah saal se syria main grih yuddh he lekin yah grih yuddh ek tarah se laghu vishwayuddh bhi he kyonki yah apni tarah kaa anokhaa grihayuddh he jisamen rus bhi bam gira rahaa he, america, france, jordan, saudi arab, turki, australia ye sab milakar bam gira rahe hai
 Far from being the solution, the world is facing another new terrorist organization ISIS and it is said that more than two and a half million people have been killed and millions displaced from Syria in this mini world war cum civil war
 aapako yaad ho to november 2015 main rus ke raashtrapati putin ne aarope lagaaya tha ki unke paas 40 deshon ke naam hai jinase aatanki sanghathan iesas ko paisa miltaa he
 Putin has also been named in the Panama Papers for allegedly using the help of Mozak Fonseca to hide his money
 ab aap aatank ke khilaaf yuddh ladane ke bhaashanon ko yaad kiijie or aatanki sanghathan se lekar pratibandhit mulk siria kii madad karne vaali companiyon ke network kii hakeekat ko dekhiye
 The game you are being lied to in the name of fighting terror can make some sense
 is yuddh main siria ke raashtrapati ko bhi aaropee mana gaya he or unki sarkaar par america ne kai prakaar kii pabandi lagaai he
 Even after this, many companies are supplying oil and gas to Syria, which its fighter planes are flying
 panama papers se pataa chalata he ki kai companiyon ne apana ek network banaakar siria ko pambadi ke baad bhi supplai jari rakhi he
 Three such companies were also banned by the US Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)
 inamen se ek company ke liye lau form mosac phonseka ne bhi kaam kiya
 a spokesperson for Mossack Fonseca told the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) that his firm reviews and background checks those clients through intermediaries such as banks and other law firms that it sends to Mossack Fonseca
 america ke tregeri department ke offis of fahrren asets control (oefasi) kii paabandiyon ke daayre main aane vaale qareeb 334 logon or companiyon ke saath mosac phonseka ne kaam kiya he
 The records say that Mossack Fonseca has made money by creating fake companies for suspected financiers of terrorists and war criminals operating in West Asia
 iske alaava mexico, guatemala or purvi europe ke drug maffia, iran or uttar korea main atom bam banane se judi jaankariyaan failaane waalon or dakshin africa ke arms dilers ke liye bhi shell companiyaan banane main mosac phonseka kaa role rahaa
 If this is true, then you should not have any difficulty in understanding the danger of having a company like Mossack Fonseca and relationship with it or taking convenience from it
 ye kisi eemaandaar or sajjan company he jo aatankwaadi sanghathan ke liye bhi company khulavaa detii he or drug mafia ke liye or niyamon ke aadhaar par safai de detii he ki ham to kuch hai hi nahin
 The bank has to review its customers and they give us a clean chit in opening the company for whom
 vaah re duniya
 So do you understand what the banks and lawyers are feeding together? is khulaase se pataa chalaa he ki varshon tak swiss banking company UBS or panama kii mosac phonseka ek duusare ke saath munaafe vaali saajhedaari main raheen
 UBS had customers who needed fake companies, ie shell companies, in other countries to hide their money
 mosac phonseka aisi companiyon ko banane main maahir thi
 But in 2010, UBS feared that it might face tax evasion and hawala cases in the US
 UBS bank ke diarector iske baad shell company ke is kaarobaar se baahar hone kii firaaq main lag gaye
 On 28 September 2010, in a meeting in Zurich, Switzerland, there was considerable tension in which UBS said that Mossack Fonseca is responsible for identifying the owners of shell companies behind the secret accounts, not the bank
 yaad kiijie abhi mosac phonseka kya kah rahi he
 She is saying that banks are not responsible for identifying dangerous customers

 500 banks had links with that Fonseca
 kya isliye hangaamaa nahin he ki chand haathon main puunji jamaa hone ke is khel ko koi kharaab nahin karnaa chahta
 Is this the game that causes one percent people to own 90 percent of their property? poonjeevaad main agar sabko baraabar kaa chance miltaa he to sara palada ek pratisht kii taraf hi kyon hai
 Isn't this whole game against the basic principle of capitalism

 Helped to locate the money of the rich
 us phonseka se 500 bainkon ke rishte rahe
 Is it not a ruckus that no one wants to spoil this game of accumulation of capital in hands? kya yahi wo khel he jiske kaaran ek pratishat logon ke paas 90 fisadi sampatti par kabza he
 If everyone gets an equal chance in capitalism, then why is the whole pan on the side? kya ye sara khel poonjeevaad ke mul siddhant ke khilaaf nahin he

 bjp's huge rise in UP has once again confirmed the dominance of PM Narendra Modi and party president Amit Shah in politics
 upi main bijepi kii visphotak badhat ne amit shah ko jahaan raajnneeti kaa 'chanakya' sabit kar diya he vahiin narendra modi 'sapanom kaa saudagar' banakar ubhare hai
 These elections have sealed strict decisions like demonetisation and surgical strikes of PM Modi
 iske saath hi yah sabit ho gaya he ki bhartiya raajnneeti kaa haalia daur modi or shah kaa he or vakt guzarane ke saath is daur ko modi-shah yug ke naam se hi janaa jayega
 The result of this pair's aggressive style has been that states like UP and Uttarakhand have become dusky in color
 amit shah isliye chanakya banakar ubhare hai kyonki unhone upi main apane dabadabe ko barkaraar rakhaa he
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, BJP had won 71 seats in UP and this time too Amit Shah contested the election in his own style especially in UP
 chote-chote dalon ke saath gathbandhan kiya
 He expressed confidence in the candidates coming from other parties to the party to bring backward class and Dalit vote bank
 isse tikat bantwaare main party ke bheetar asantosh jarur panpa lekin bijepi ne usko samay rahete hi tham liya
 His booth management, known closely to Amit Shah, is convincing in his ability to assess ethnic mathematics in elections and turn prospects into votes
 unki ranneetiyaan isiilie paramparaagat lihaaj se ekadam alag hoti he lekin uske apratyaashit nattejey bhi milte hai
 It is worth mentioning that the way Akhilesh emerged in the wake of the feud in the ruling SP family in the last few days, Akhilesh emerged as the most preferred leader in the opinion polls in october-november
 uske baad congress ke saath gathbandhan ko unka 'master stroke' qaraar diya gaya
 On the other hand, BJP had not declared any Chief Minister
 tikat bantwaare ko lekar bhi sabase zyada party main asantosh dikhaa or chunaav shuru hone se ain pehle yah mana jane laga ki akhilesh sabase par baari pad sakate hai
 But with the start of UP elections, the whole atmosphere started to change as PM Modi started campaigning
 chunaav prachaar kaa jimmaa unhone khud uthaaya
 Recorded rallies started, and by firing new arrows from their quiver, they started attacking the opponents
 vipakshi piem modi kii gati, urja ko dekhakar hairaan rah gaye
 In fact, the SP and the BSP felt that the BJP might not have fielded them in UP in the same way, taking lessons from Bihar, but to surprise the opponents, PM Modi took the election command into his own hands and started leading 
 dekhte hi dekhte tisare charan ke chunaav se maahaul badalane laga or antim charan se pehle to purvanchal kii dhuree banaras main teen din tak road sho or reliyaan kar unhone virodhiyon ko haankene par majaboor kar diya
 The comments piem modi ne jis tarah se unhone party adhyaksh amit shah ke saath is baar kaa upi chunaav ladaa he, usase media main bhi yah kaha jane laga ki aisa lag rahaa he ki yah bhartiya raajnneeti kaa antim chunaav he
 Such an election has never been fought in the state politics
 darasal piem modi ke bare main raajnneetik vishleshkon kaa maananaa he ki vah puri tarah se jan bhaavana ko samajhate hai or uske anuroop hi faisle lete hai
 Due to this, he has completely dominated this time in the mind of the public
 shaayad yahi kaaran he ki notebandi jaise sakht faisle lene ke baad bhi logon kaa apaar samarthan unako hasil ho jaataa he or seemapar sargical strike jaise faisle lekar janata kaa dil jeet lete hai

 The way PM Modi has contested the UP election this time with party president Amit Shah, it has been said in the media that it seems that this is the last election in Indian politics
 aisa chunaav pradesh kii raajnneeti main pehle kabhi nahin ladaa gaya
 Actually, about PM Modi political analysts believe that he fully understands the public sentiment and takes decisions accordingly
 iske chalate janata ke jehan main is daur main vah puri tarah se haaavee ho chuke hai
 Perhaps this is the reason that even after taking tough decisions like demonetisation, people get immense support and win the hearts of the people by taking decisions like cross-border surgical strikes

 modi sarkaar ke khilaaf tidipi kii ore se laae gaye avishvaas prastaav ko manjuur kar liya gaya he
 The Lok Sabha Speaker has set the date for Friday to discuss and vote on the no-confidence motion
 loksabhaa main avishvaas prastaav ke bahaane politics kaa wo twanti-twanti match hone vaala he, jisamen satta or vipaksh donon ko 2019 se thik pehle batting karne kaa bharpoor mauka mila he
 Most opposition parties, including the Congress, are united, but the Modi government does not appear to be much apprehensive about it
 modi ke paas paryaapt number he, aise main sarkaar sadan main avishvaas prastaav kii agnipariksha ko aasaani se paar kar legi
 In such a situation, the opposition has got stuck in PM Modi's bet by bringing a no confidence motion against the NDA government
 bataa den ki congress dwaara modi sarkaar kii vifaltaaon ke mudde par avishvaas prastaav ko loksabhaa adhyaksh sumitra mahajan ne manjuur nahin kiya, balki unhone tidipi dwaara andhra pradesh ko special stats kaa darja die ke mudde par avishvaas prastaav ko manjuuri di
 TDP has been a one-time partner in bjp-led NDA
 andhra pradesh ko special package ke mudde par naata todakar tidipi alag ho gai he
 Since then, he has been continuously demanding a no-confidence motion, which was supported by other parties including the Congress
 monsoon satr ke pehle din hi tidipi, congress, ensipi jaisi partiyon ne phir se avishvaas prastaav diya
 On this, Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan accepted the no-confidence motion moved by TDP
 iske baad charchaa or voting kaa din bhi tay kar diya
 However, the Modi government has been avoiding the no-confidence motion brought by the opposition for the last two sessions
 bajet satr main congress or wiesar congress kii kai koshishon ke baavjood loksabhaa adhyaksh ne avishvaas prastaav ko manjuur nahin kiya tha
 In such a situation, the opposition got caught in PM Modi's 'trap' by taking notice of the no-confidence motion on the first day of the monsoon session and fixing the day for discussion and voting
 545 sadasyon vaali loksabhaamein maujuuda samay main 535 saansad hai
 That is, the BJP needs only 268 mps to get a majority
 loksabhaa adhyaksh ko hataakar bijepi ke paas abhi 273 sadsy hai
 Apart from this, bjp's allies have 18 members from Shiv Sena, 6 from LJP, 4 from Akali Dal, 3 from RLSP, 2 from JDU, 2 from Apna Dal
 is tarah se kul sankhya 314 pahunch rahi he
 In such a situation, the BJP will have no problem in dropping the no confidence motion and saving the government
 avishvaas prastaav modi sarkaar ke liye agnipariksha kii tarah he
 The BJP currently has 273 mps in the Lok Sabha alone
 jabaki bahumat ke liye use 272 saansadon kaa aankada chahie
 In this case, the BJP has more than one member
 lekin maujuuda samay main bijepi ke kai saansad baagi rukh akhriyaar kiye hue hai
 These include Shatrughan Sinha, Kirti Azad and Savitri Bai Phule
 aise main teen siten kam kar di jaaen to bijepi ke paas 270 kaa aankada bachataa he, jabaki use bahumat ke liye sirf 268 vot chahie
 That is, the Modi government does not even need allies to drop the motion of no confidence
 vipakshi dalon kii baat karen to maujuuda samay main loksabhaa main sabase zyada 48 siten congress ke paas hai
 The TDP, which has moved the no-confidence motion, has 16 seats, while JDS 1, NCP 7, RJD 4, TMC 34, CPIM 9, SP have 7 members
 iske alaava aam aadmi ke 4, tiares ke 11, wiesar congress ke 4,eudief ke 3 or bijedy ke 20 sadsy hai
 They mix it up yet they are not able to touch the figure of 268
 is tarah saaf he ki sadan main avishvaas prastaav kaa aundhe munh girnaa tay he
 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar again raised the matter of giving special status to his state in the meeting of NITI Aayog
 ravivaar ko raashtrapati bhawan main hui niti ayog ke gavarning council kii chauthi baithak main nitish kumaar ne bihar ko vishesh rajya kaa darja die jane ke paksh main joardaar tark die
 During this, he also gave many suggestions and said that with the mid-day meal scheme, the schools have now become Bhojshala
 lihaaja yah behatar hoga ki poshaahar ke liye bacchon ko raashi uplabdh karai jaae, taaki vidyalayon main padhane kaa maahaul ban sake
 CM Nitish Kumar also raised the issue of National Crop Insurance and said that most of the premium in the insurance scheme goes to the insurance companies, hence the Bihar State Crop Assistance Scheme has been introduced
 unhone kaha ki bihar main sharabbandi, bal vivaah or dahej virdohi abhiyaan jari he
 For this, special support of NITI Aayog should be provided and additional resources should be made available
 nitish kumaarane sabase pehle bihar ko vishesh rajya kaa darja dene kii maang kii or kaha ki agar antar-kshetreey or antarraji vikaas ke str bhinnata se sambandhit aankadon kii samiksha kii jaae, to paaya jayega ki kai rajya vikaas ke vibhinn maapdandon par rashtriya ausat se kaaphi neeche hai
 These parameters include per capita income, education, health, energy, human development index etc
 unhone kaha ki tarksangat aarthik ranneeti vahi hogi, jo aise nivesh or antaran paddati ko protsaahit kare, jisase pichhade rajyon ko ek nirdhaarit samay seemaa main vikaas ke rashtriya ausat tak pahunchane main madad mili
 The demand for our special state status is based on this concept
 ham lagaataar centre sarkaar se bihar ko vishesh rajya kaa darja die jane kii maang kar rahe hai
 Bihar will get all-round development after attaining special state status
 rajya ko apane sansadhano kaa upyog anya vikaas or kalyankari yojanaon main karne kaa avasar milegaa
 On the other hand, private investment will be encouraged due to the anticipated GST reimbursement in the Central GST as per the states having special status
 soobe main kaarkaane lagenge, rojgaar ke nae avasar srujit honge or logon ke jivan str main sudhaar aayega

 congress mahasachiv priyanka gandhi ne desh kii arthvyavastha main susti ko lekar ek baar phir modi sarkaar par hamalaa bolaa he
 On Tuesday, he (priyanka Gandhi) said that the BJP government only wants to avoid its responsibility
 priyanka gandhi ne ise lekar ek twit bhi kiya
 He (priyanka Gandhi) wrote in the tweet that all that is to be told from the BJP government is that it would be difficult for those of you who want to avoid the responsibility of letting the caravan be looted from here and there
 log dekh rahe hai
 The recession hit another company and people will be unemployed
 priyanka gandhi ne apane twit ke saath ek khabar kii saajha kii he jisamen mahindra and mahindra ke sanyantr main 17 dinon tak kisi bhi tarah kaa vinirmaan nahin hoga
 In such a situation, many more people are being told to be laid off
 bataa den ki yah koi pehla mauka nahin he jab priyanka gandhi ne centre sarkaar par sust arthvyavastha or berogari ko lekar hamalaa bolaa ho
 Earlier, Priyanka Gandhi had reacted strongly to the statement made by Union Minister Santosh Gangwar about unemployed youth
 unhone kaha tha kimantriji, 5 saal se zyada aapaki sarkaar he
 Jobs were not created
 jo naukariyaan thim wo sarkaar dwaara laai aarthik mandi ke chalate chhin rahi hai

 desh main yogyata (skill) kii kami he or sarkaar ne iske liye kaushal vikaas mantralay bhi kholaa he
 The job of this ministry is to educate children according to jobs
 bataa den ki santosh gangavar ne shanivaar ko bareli main samvaadadaataaon se baatcheet main kaha tha, 'desh main rojgaar kii kami nahin he lekin uttar bharat main jo recruitment karne aate hai, is baat kaa sawaal karte hai ki jis pad ke liye ham (karmchaaree) rakh rahe hai uski quality kaa vyakti hamen kam miltaa he
 'he had said that nowadays there is talk of employment in newspapers

 However, when Nitish came in front of the media citing the reasons for his resignation, he did not forget to target his arch rival Narendra Modi
 nitish ne kaha ki narendra modi kii aguwai main sampradayik dhruvikaran hua or logon ke bich bhram failaayaa gaya
 In a conversation with reporters today after the JD (U) Legislature Party meeting, Nitish did not say who he was going to make his successor
 lekin modi par nishaanaa jarur saadhaa
 He said, 'this time the kind of mandate has come
 is tarah kaa vicitra maahaul kabhi nahin dekha gaya
 As the vote pattern is seen right now, it is clear that there is talk of communal polarization on a very large scale
 logon ke bich bhram failaayaa gaya
 One-sided talk was made using the publicity system, others did not come forward
 'nitish ne saaf kiya ki unhone bhavuk hokar siem pad chhodane kaa faisla nahin liya he
 Taking the moral responsibility of defeat in the Lok Sabha elections, he left the cm's chair

 The caretaker CM said, 'we accepted the responsibility
 yah bhavavesh main nahin hai
 We believe in ideals and moral values
 uske aadhaar par yah antarman se faisla liya
 Indicating that there was no split within the party, Nitish said that after taking the decision, he consulted some key party colleagues
 party adhyaksh se bhi baat kii
 But no partner was initially ready
 unhone kaha, 'jis din nattejey aa rahe the, logon ko lag rahaa tha ki main bhaavana ke pravaah main kah rahaa hum
 Waited for one day
 saathiyon se baat kii
 Opinions expressed
 saathiyon ko laga ki naitik mulyon par aadhaarit faisla he
 They said you can take this decision
 tab tyaagptr diya
 On the political uproar after the resignation, Nitish said, "convened a meeting of the legislature party
 maahaul aisa tha
 Nobody was willing to listen
 sarvasammati se faisla kiya ki ham aapako dobaaraa chunate hai
 i explained the whole thing
 phir bhi ve date rahe
 i said give me time to think
 phir baithak bulaai
 Yesterday, in the meeting, one thing was revealed
 uske baad hamane vidhayak saathiyon se alag alag or samooh main baat kii
 People were satisfied
 aaj vidhayak dal kii baithak hui to un logon kaa 'moraal' ooncha hua
 He said that we are proud of this decision
 ye saadhaaran faisla nahin he
 We have extraordinary circumstances
 unase ladane ke liye asaadhaaran faisle karne padate hai
 The JD (U) leader said, 'we struggled in student life, being in the JP movement
 jab janpratinidhi bane, jan samasyaon ko uthaaya
 Got a chance to work as a minister in the center too
 bihar kii janata ne janadesh diya
 As a CM, he spent eight and a half years in Bihar
 aaj bihar main koi nahin kah saktaa ki kaam nahin hua
 Or i was not able to work
 ab party main sabhi saathiyon se vimarsh karte hue baithenge
 Will review aage ke bare main kaaryayojna banaaenge
 But the mlas have accepted my decision

 com / svydcmedrs The movement of workers at the car company General Motors (GM )'s Halol plant in India entered its second week on Wednesday
 shramikon ke andolan se jiem ko rojaanaa 100 ikai utpaadan kaa nuksaan ho rahaa he
 Workers at gm's Halol plant went on strike on 16 March
 ye shramik kuch karmchaariyon ko dilarship outlet main sthanantarit kiye jane kaa virodh kar rahe the
 Also, the employees are opposing the long-term pay agreement signed last December
 jiem india ke upaadhyaksh pi balendran ne kaha, 900 shramikon main se 550 kaam par laut aae hai
 350 are still absent
 philhal ham sirf ek paali main kaam kar rahe hai
 The Halol plant has a capacity of 85,000 units annually
 balendran ne kaha ki philhal company ke is sanyantr main rojaanaa 70 kaaren ban rahi hai, jabaki ausatan 190 ikaiyaan taiyaar hoti hai
 Thus far 600 units of production have been lost due to labor discontent
 paanch maah main halol sanyantr main duusari baar hadtaal hui he
 Earlier, on October 29, 2010, 900 workers went on a four-day strike demanding wage hike
 bhrashtachar ke khilayenna hajaareka anshan jari he or sarkaar sakate main he
 As a result, half a dozen ministers of the government are engaged in rhetoric together
 sarkaar kah rahi he ki hajaare thodaa vakt den to ham janalokapal bilpar joint cameti par vichaar kar sakate hai
 But Anna says that the government's intention is not right, it is misleading people
 virappa moili, kapil sibbal, ambika soni, prithviraj chouhan, sahit sarkaar ke kai mantri or congress ke kai netaa anna hajaare par bayaan dene main jute hai
 Anna Hazare demands that the people of the public participate in the drafting of the Jan Lokpal Bill
 sarkari jioem se kaam nahin chalegaa
 The government says that the doors are open for Anna's demand but there is a time problem
 lokapal par bani jioem ke mantri abhi chunaav main vyast hai
 The Prime Minister's Office has also once again appealed to Anna Hazare
 pradhanmantri karyaalay dukhi he ki prasiddh samajasevi anna hajaare ab bhi bhukh hadtaal jari kiye hue hai
 In a meeting with Anna Hazare on 7 March, the Prime Minister praised Hazare's stand on corruption
 pradhanmantri ne ek sabakmeti bana unke prastaavit draft par vichaar kii baat kahi
 The committee headed by AK Antony met Anna Hazare, but the meeting remained inconclusive
 hajaare sarkaar par apana puraa bill sweekaar karne kaa dabaav bana rahe hai
 The Prime Minister respects the idea and mission of Anna Hazare
 is tarah sarkaar ne anna par aarope jadaa ki wo sarkaar par dabaav bana apni maange manwaane kii jid par ade hai jise hajaare ne sire se khaarij kar diya
 Anna said that show the way out to Sharad Pawar involved in the gom on Lokpal and bring our people
 is par sarkaar chup rahi lekin sharad pavaar ne kaha mujhe har jioem se hataa do
 But troubled by this slow movement of the leaders, Anna made it clear that no leader should come to his event
 uma bharti or omprakash chautaala ko dharne se lautaa diya gaya
 However, all these are reaching him only in support of Anna

 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne 3 disambar ko uttar pradesh ke muradabad kii chunavi jansabha main ek bhikhaari ke swip mashin istemaal karne vaale whatsap video kaa zikr kar chaunkaane kii koshish kii
 They were appealing for digital transactions through it
 haalanki ve shaayad jaan-boojhkar un tathyon par rajnatik lep chadhaane kii koshish kar rahe the, jo isaki raah main baadhak hai
 After demonetisation, the way the debate was diverted from black money to cashless and then to the cash economy, the government's frustration was expressed
 sarkaar ko ehsaas ho gaya ki raturaat itane bade badlaav ke liye desh kaa dhaancha abhi taiyaar nahin he
 With the inadequate infrastructure for cash transactions in terms of population, the result of half-hearted preparations by the Reserve Bank and the government was that the entire system of atms, which had become part of the lifestyle like tap water, came to a standstill
 isaki badi vajah thi ki 8 november se pehle tak atm kareeb-kareeb nakadi nikasi kaa ekmaatr madhyam ho chukaa tha
 Most people will hardly remember when they visited the bank branch before 8 November
 lekin notebandi ke ek maheene baad bhi atm ke baahar antaheen kataren or bainkon ke daravaaje par no-cash (note nahin) ke board surkhiyon main chhaae hue hai
 In such a situation, the question and management of the government and RBI are bound to remain
 badintjami se bikharaa prabandhanpradhanmantri modi ke raashtra ke naam sambodhan ke mahaj dedh ghante baad 8 november kii raat 10 baje pehali soochna atm network se jude tantron ko di jaati he ki 9 november ko arabiai governor urjit patel ne baithak bulaai he
 Representatives of four major banks — SBI, Axis Bank, ICICI, HDFC, NCR Corporation, Diebold and Cash Logistics, two major ATM networks, were invited to the meeting
 is baithak main pehali baar nae note dikhaae gaye
 According to sources, in this meeting Urjit Patel gave instructions to do three tasks immediately
 ek, jitne 1000-500 ru
 'S old notes are in the ATM network, bringing them back in 48 hours
 ise unhone oechdi (old haai-dinomination karency ivacuation) naam diya
 Secondly, start the work of ATM recalibration (changing the tray according to the size of the new note) on a war footing
 tisare, jab tak puri prakriya chal rahi he, cash logisticks companiyaan atm main 100-100 ru
 Let's fill the note
 lekin is atirikt kaam ke liye bhugtan kii raashi tay nahin ho pai or samanvay ke liye koi ek tantra nahin ban paaya
 Therefore, the cash logistics company withdrew the old currency but the ATM recalibration work could not be started
 sutron ke mutabik, pradhanmantri ke japan daure se lautne ke baad 13 november ko notebandi kii samasya se nipatane kaa ek note taiyaar kar vitt mantri arun jetali or urja mantri piyush goyal ne pradhanmantri ke saamne rakhaa
 On November 14, a large task force was set up by the RBI on the basis of recalibration to prepare the ATM according to the size of the new note
 phir, pehali baar kaaman acshan plan (cap) taiyaar hua
 In Mumbai, Vikhroli outlined a call for a team of 50 people involved in coordination - withdrawal, recalibration, filling of money with fixed timelines
 atm ko durust karne kaa kaam 15 november yani notebandi ke ek hafte baad shuru ho paaya
 Difficulties of ATM and Cash System The entire ATM system is outsourced
 kis atm main kitni nakadi daalana, bainkon se nakadi uthaanaa or atm ke hisaab se cash processing karne kaa puraa network banking pranali se alag he
 Currently, there are around 2,25,000 atms in the country, of which 25,000 are for cash deposits
 baaki alag-alag companiyon ke paas he (dekhen box)
 The bank operates these atms on two models - the capex and the opex model
 capex main bank kii apni capital vaali mashin hoti he, jabaki opex main baahar kii mashine hoti hai or companiyaan uskaa rakh-rakhaav karti hai
 The companies have around 25,000 ATM engineers, who carried out this work
 cash logisticks companiyaan isamen last mil connactivity kii bhoomika nibhaati hai
 SBI, Axis, HDFC and ICICE account for 65 per cent of the ATM network
 cash logisticks main esaies-procigore, siemes, brinks, riter sefguard, logicash jaisi agrani companiyaan hai
 According to the data, Cash Management has 10,000 cash vans, with 8,800 registered
 300 cash walt or kul 48,000 karmchaaree hai, jisamen driver, surakshakarmi, cash castodian, walt officer, cash processing karmi aadi shaamil hai
 But after demonetisation it was not possible to carry out this operation with so little manpower
 cash logisticks association ke president ruturaj sinha kehete hai, ''notebandi ke baad abhootpurv kaam hua he
 The initial four nights could not sleep
 hamane apane karmchaariyon se kaha ki kaale dhan ke khilaaf muhim main jisase jo ban padataa he, kare
 Those who want to contribute in this fight, bring two pairs of cloth and toothbrush
 hamaare karmiyon ne isamen saraahneey yogadan diya
 "while Navroz Dastur, MD of NCR Corporation, a pioneer in ATM management, said that the engineer had to go and change components in cassettes at every ATM, which was done on a war footing
 haalanki is puure oparation main hue kharch ko lekar abhi maathapai jari he
 Dastur says that this work will have to be paid extra
 philhal arabiai ne in companiyon ke atirikt bhugtan ke liye esbiai ke sioo prashanth kumaar kii aguwai main alag cameti bana di he
 But why are atms stalled? Says Dastur, "atms are stalled not because of malfunction but because of lack of cash
" "nakadi kii kami puri karnaa dur kii kaudisarkaar or arabiai chaahe lakh daawey kar le, lekin note kii chapai or use bank-atm tak pahunchane kii raftaar kii vajah se koi yah kehane kii sthiti main nahin he ki halaat kab saamaanya honge
 The lack of currency is the reason for long queues in front of atms that become the lifeline of people
 sutron ke mutabik, 8 november se pehle atm vetan-pension ke samay 1 se 10 taarikh tak rojaanaa 10-12 hajaar karod ru
 7–8 thousand crores was spent on the remaining days
 lekin notebandi ke baad kii sthiti behad dayaneey he
 According to the sources, less than one-third of the total cash is being made available to cash logistics companies for filling in atms
 ek adhikari bataate hai ki vetan ke samay bhi atm main bharne ke liye mahaj 2800-4000 karod ru
 The amount is being available
 haalanki is maamle main dastur or sinha kii daleel alag he
 He says this is half-true because earlier cash used to be withdrawn through atms, but today the burden on bank and POS medium has also increased due to which the share of cash is divided, hence cash logistics is getting less
 digital dhaanche main phiseddi sarkarbharat main 98 fisadi lenden nakadi main hota he
 Statistics show that in the last five years, currency circulation has increased at the rate of 15% per annum
 aabaadi, dukaane badaae or zyada bank-atm kii vajah se cash velocity bhi badi he
 But the government and RBI did not take concrete steps towards increasing the structure of money transactions in proportion to the pace with which the economy has grown
 pradhanmantri modi kii apil ke baad bijepi or sarkaar lagaataar digital lenden ko badhaava dene kii muhim main jute gai he
 But in this case the government is seen to be hiding from the facts
 lagaataar yah prachaar kiya ja rahaa he ki bharat main nakadi-jidipi kaa anupaat kaaphi adhik he
 This is almost double that of Japan in India
 bharat jaise anya deshon ke mukaable bhi yah bhram failaane kii koshish sach se pare he
 There are 108 bank branches, 149 atms and 889 POS machines per 10 lakhs in India
 (dekhen baaki deshon ke tulanaatmak graphic) rupai card ho yaa debit card, zyaadaatar istemaal atm se nakad nikasi ke liye hota he
 The Modi government may call it a historic step, but according to experts, it will not increase digital transactions by more than 2-3 per cent
 aise main samasyaon ke jhanjhaavat se jujh rahi janata kitna badalegi, shaayad modi bakhubi samaj chuke hai
 The conflict between the Supreme Court and the government has increased in Maldives
 halaat ye ho gaye hai ki supreme court ne raashtrapati abdulla yamin kii giraftaar kaa aadesh diya he
 Whereas the President has refused to accept the court order
 maldive kii sena ne ravivaar ko sansad parisar ko gher liya
 Amid this political storm, the Supreme Court has requested help from other democratic countries including India
 kyon hua vivadadrasal, maldive ke supreme court ne guuruuvaar ko nirvasit purv raashtrapati mohammad nashid samet jail main band anya kaidiyon ko turant reeha karne kaa aadesh diya tha
 However, President Abdulla Yameen refused to accept the court order
 court ne nashid samet 9 raajnneetik bandiyon ko reeha karne or 12 sansad sadasyon ko behaal karne kaa aadesh diya tha
 The court said that the dissidents must be released as the case against them was politically motivated and wrong
 court ne kya kahacort ne kaha he, 'aadesh kaa paalan ho jane or kaidiyon ko reeha kar die jane ke baad unke khilaaf dobaaraa mukadmaa chalaane se mahabhiyojak ko kuch bhi nahin roktaa he
 The Supreme Court's order to reinstate 12 mps will put the current President Abdulla Yameen's party in a minority, as Yameen's chair is threatened
 jiske baad unpar mahabhiyog kaa khatra mandara saktaa he
 This is because these mps separated from the ruling party and joined the opposition
 do saansad giraftaaris bich, police ne do vipakshi saansadon ko giraftaar kar liya he
 These mps returned home on Sunday itself
 vipaksh kaa bayanmukhya vipakshi maldivian democratic party (amdipi) ne kaha he ki unhen baithak tak nahin karne di gai
 The government did not allow them to hold meetings using security forces
 sansad ke andar force tainaatmaldive main lambey samay se takaraav kii sthiti he
 Armed forces have been stationed inside the People's Majlis, the parliament here since March last year, when Yameen ordered them to expel the disgruntled mps
 kya he sarkaar kaa pakshasarkaar kii taraf se kaha gaya he ki, 'raashtrapati ko giraftaar karne kaa supreme court kaa koi bhi faisla asanvaidhanik or avaidh hoga
 Therefore, police and army have been asked not to comply with any unconstitutional order
 'purana he vivadmaujuuda vipakshi netaa mohammad nashid maldive ke pehle nirvaachit raashtrapati bane the
 In March 2015, he was sentenced to 13 years in prison on terror charges
 jiske baad abdulla yamin raashtrapati ban gaye
 On Thursday, the Supreme Court called the case against Nasheed politically motivated and ordered his release
 saath hi yamin kii party se alag hokar vipaksh ke kheme main jane vaale 12 saansadon kii bahaali ke aadesh bhi supreme court ne de die
 If the order of the Supreme Court comes into force then the chair of the incumbent President can go
 yahi vajah he ki wo aadesh maanane se inkaar kar rahe hai, jiske chalate supreme court ne bharat se loktantr or samvidhan ko bachaane main madad kii guhaar lagaai he
