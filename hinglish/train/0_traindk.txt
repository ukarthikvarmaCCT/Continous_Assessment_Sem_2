 sonia gandhi kii congress rahul kii to pehle hi ho chuki thi
 Slowly the organization's changes were also visible, but the biggest change happened on Friday, which was also to be removed from his pen, the most powerful post after the party president
 ji haa, ham baat kar rahe hainjanardan dvivediki, jo kareeb dedh dashak se party ke sanghathan mahasachiv the
 His signature led to a press release of the formation or removal of someone in the Heparti organization, but today was a strange political day, when the press release of the signature of General Secretary Janardan Dwivedi came as an organization
 press relies memshok gahalotake nae sanghathan mahasachiv banane kii ghoshnaa thi, to duusari taraf janardan dvivedi ke hatane kaa elaan
 As usual, this release too was signed by Janardan Dwivedi
 ye bataur sanghathan mahasachiv unki aakhri relies sabit hui
 Influenced by Janardan Dwivedi Indira Gandhi, the student came to the Congress at the time of politics
 indira gandhi se milakar samaajawaadee vichaaron vaale janardan dvivedi kai dashakon se congress sanghathan kaa hissaa rahe
 Janardhan never left the party
 bebaaki se raay dete rahe hai dvivediindira ke baad rajeev gandhi ke saath bhi kaam kiya
 In the party organization, he is still known as 'pandit ji'
 sonia ke bhaashan likhane main bhi pandit ji kii ahm bhoomika rahi
 Pandit is known in the party as a law-abiding, scholar, poet and litterateur
 wo rajyasabha se saansad bhi rahe
 Recently his term was over
 sutron kii maane to janardan dvivedi ne khud hi rahul se sanghathan main badlaav ke liye hatane kaa prastaav pehle hi de diya tha
 By the way, it is also believed that Janardan's political opinion, known for his unassuming opinion, was less in line with Rahul
 kai maukon par to party ke faislon par wo apana virodh jataate rahe
 However, Janardan took great care to keep his point in the right place
 haalanki, ek do baar unke stand ko lekar kaaphi bavaal bhi hua

 rahul ke karibiyon ke mutabik, unako kaaphi pehle sanghathan se hataaya janaa tha, lekin sonia ke hastkshep ke chalate wo bane rahe
 But when Sonia returned, Rahul came, then that is what has to happen
 vaise janardan kii bebaak salaah or unke anubhav ko dekhte hue ye bhi kaha ja rahaa he ki, rahul unako kisi or tareeke se istemaal karte rahenge
 Gehlot away from cm's race! However, in this latest change, the experts are seeing another hidden message
 wo ye ki bhale hi rahul ne saaf kiya ho ki rajasthan main koi siem kaa cheharaa nahin hoga
 But by giving important responsibility to Gehlot in the central organization, the way of becoming chief minister has probably been further removed
 isse pehle aahista aahista rahul sanghathan main lagaataar badlaav karte aaye hai
 The charge of another general secretary BK Hariprasad was given to Jitendra Singh, close to Rahul

 Earlier too, Rahul has gradually appointed several new state Congress presidents and in-charge of the state himself and this process will continue to go on slowly
 aakhir rahul jatke se badlaav karke tamaam netaaon ko ek saath jhatka nahin dena chaahate, jisase bagawati tevar kaa khatra rahe

 Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner has also come under the scanner of the FBI investigating Russia's interference in the US presidential election
 maamle main white house ke senior adwiser jaired kushanar kii bhoomika ko lekar jaanch kii ja rahi he
 Actually, there was a meeting between Kushner and the Russian authorities, due to which their alliance with Russia is being talked about
 iske alaava FBI ke adhikariyon kaa maananaa he ki kushanar se america raashtrapati chunaav menrusidakhal ke ahm saboot mil sakate hai
 Now the US investigative agency is investigating documents related to Trump's election campaign, keeping ties with former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn from Kushner and Kushner's contact with Russia
 haal hi main trump ne flin ko rus ke saath gathjod ke aarope main pad se hataa diya tha
 However, FBI officials say that Kushner has not been named in the case at present
 disambar 2016 main kushanar ne america main rus ke rajdoot sargey kislyak or roosi banker sargey gorvok ke saath mulaakaat kii thi
 Also supervised the data analysis operation of Trump's election campaign
 haalanki abhi tak yah spasht nahin ho paaya he ki FBI maamle ko lekar kushanar se poochtacha karegi yaa nahin? is babat kushanar ke pravaktaa kaa kahana he ki abhi unako is babat koi jaankaree nahin he
 At the same time, Kushner's attorney Jamie Gorelick said he would cooperate if the FBI contacted his client in the case
 america raashtrapati chunaav menrusi dakhlandaji kii FBI kealawa congress kii kai samitiyaan jaanch kar rahi hai
 Kushner is the husband of Ivanka Trump, the daughter of US President Donald Trump
 isse pehle trump ne maamle kii jaanch kar rahe james komi ko epabiai pramukh ke pad se hataa diya tha, jiske baad se buree tarah ghire hue hai
 The final decision is likely to be held soon in the assembly elections of Maharashtra, Haryana and Jharkhand along with the Lok Sabha elections
 bijepi sutron ke anusaar party alaakaman rajya ikaayiyon se baatcheet kar is bare main faisla karegaa
 Significantly, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been advocating for holding all elections simultaneously
 aise main april may main aam chunaavon ke saath in rajyon ke chunaav karaane kii charchaa bhi shuru ho gai he
 As it is, elections are to be held in Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim along with general elections
 sambhaavna he ki jammu kashmir ke vidhansabha chunaav bhi saath main hi hon
 However, BJP units in bjp-ruled Maharashtra, Jharkhand and Haryana are not in favor of early elections
 unka maananaa he ki abhi rajya sarkaron ke kai mahatvapurn kaam hai jinhen puraa karnaa jaruri he
 The term of the Haryana Legislative Assembly is till 2 November 2019
 jharkhand kaa paanch janvari 2020 tak
 While the term of Maharashtra Legislative Assembly is till 9 November 2019
 ek saath chunaav karaane ke bare main niti ayog ne apni report main kaha he ki isaki shuruyaat is saal loksabhaa chunaav ke saath hi ho sakati he
 For this, the assembly elections of Jharkhand, Maharashtra and Haryana should be held along with the Lok Sabha elections
 iske liye maharashtra or haryana vidhansabha ke kaarykalon main paanch-paanch maheene kii katautee or jharkhand vidhansabha ke kaarykaal main saat maheene kii katautee kii ja sakati he
 In Maharashtra, the situation with the alliance with Shiv Sena is changing rapidly
 pehle shivasena alag chunaav ladane kaa elaan kar chuki thi
 But now there is a possibility that both the parties will contest simultaneously
 shivasena chaahati he ki loksabhaa ke saath hi vidhansabha ko lekar bhi siton kaa bantwaaraa ho jaae
 The last time both parties fought the Lok Sabha elections together but the Assembly elections separately
 aise main mana ja rahaa he ki maharashtra main bhi loksabhaa ke saath hi vidhansabha chunaav karaane kaa faisla ho saktaa he
 On the other hand, everyone's eyes are on the Jind assembly by-election in Haryana
 bijepi netaaon kaa kahana he ki vaise to vidhansabha chunaav samay par hi hone chahie
 But if the BJP wins Jind's assembly by-election, then the party high command can suggest to conduct assembly elections along with Lok Sabha
 isaki ek badi vajah sthaneey nikaayon ke chunaavon main bijepi ko mili kamyaabi or bikharaa vipaksh he
 In Jharkhand, the state unit believes that early elections will be of no benefit
 unke mutabik abhi rajya sarkaar kii kareeb chah maheene kii badi yojanaon par kaam hona baaki he
 In such a situation, it would be better to conduct Jharkhand elections on time
 unhone kaha ki kuch samay tak unki suraksha badi rahegi
 The officer said, '
 
 
 koi vishisht alert nahin he lekin faisle ke baad se hi unke ghar ke aasapaas suraksha badi hui he
 The officer did not say how many policemen have been deployed under his protection

 kaarykram ke 'maid in india parfect for da world' seshan main araku coffee ke nideshak manoj kumaar ne apni coffee ke bare main bataaya, 'jo abhi paris main milti he or jald hibharatamen bhi bikne lagegi
 We started our work in the hills where no one used to go and the tribals living there did not grow anything
 british ne saal 1900 main coffee ugaana shuru kiya tha
 During that time we faced many difficulties
 darasal, hamaare liye jis coffee kii laagat 500 rupee prati kilo thi, uski baahar bazaar main keemat 160 rupee thi
 So we were suffering a lot
 'unhone bataaya, 'hamaare saamne ek chalange tha ki aisi coffee banaai jaae, jo 1000 rupee kilo main bik sake or ab ham aisa kar rahe hai
 There are about 10 thousand farmers doing this work right now and we have 20 million food and 10 million coffee plants
 bataa den, ki aadhe acre jameen se 3 lakh rupee kamaaye ja sakate hai, jiske baad log isaki tarah aakarshith ho rahe hai
 Designer Raghavendra said about luxury, and luxury is different for everyone
 unhone bataaya, 'mere liye lagjri dukaanon par nahin he or mere liye baahar janaa or ghar waalon dost ke saath ek jangal main time bitaana lagjri he
 My team also does this and luxury is for a short time
 'amrapali ke creative diarector tarang aroda ne bataaya ki ab graahakon keepnsadka dhyaan rakhana hota he
 If a product is made in India, then you cannot put elephant horses in it for the trade
 isliye ise creative tareeke se bechnaa hota he
 They believe that people of India see Indian brands abroad and then come to India and trust them
 vahiin samay ke parivartan ke saath hi log bhi nayaa chaahate hai
 Seren said, now the approach to buying a house has changed
 ab aisa nahin he ki log isliye ghar nahin kharidte hai, jahaan aaraam kar sake
 He does not want any place where he can go and rest
 darasal wo aisi jagah chaahate hai jahaan jindagi kaa har ek hissaa ek anubhav ho
 Manan said, "it takes time to popularize any one luxury brand and many efforts and different decisions have to be made, including lowering the price
 unka maananaa he kiindiamein or bhi zyada mushkil he or graahak bhi smart ho gaye or ab speshfic item maangate hai or wo jaanate hai unhen kya khareednaa he

 Obviously, Confusion is reasonable when the market is awash with all kinds of attractive goods
 ham aapaki uljhan sulajhaate hai or bataate hai ki is shubh din par kya khareednaa uchit rahegaa
 First of all, it is religious that one should buy metal in Diwali
 isi baat ko lekar agar ham aage badhen to dekh sakate hai ki log is avasar par pehle bartan vagairah to kharidte the saath hi chaandi ke saamaan bhi kharidte the
 Due to the glut of electronic goods in the market, it decreased slightly
 lekin behatar hoga ki dhaatu ke saamaan hi kharide jaaen
 This time, gold prices are falling and there is a lot of uncertainty on its future
 aisa nahin lagata ki ab iske daam badhenge
 The interest of both speculators and investors is declining
 isliye isamen nivesh karnaa sahi nahin hoga
 If you are still interested in it, then you can buy gold coins and that too from any government institution like MMTC or any bank etc
 somvaar ko dilli ke thok bazaar main sone ke sikke (aath gram) 24,300 rupye prati ke bhav se bole ja rahe the
 But the best purchase in this Dhanteras will be silver goods
 chaandi is samay dharti ko chhu rahi he
 Its prices had increased slightly to Rs 38,850 per kg on Monday
 is rate par bhi yah kaaphi acha sauda he
 You may remember that silver prices went up to Rs 76,000 per kg a few months ago
 jaahir he ki yah bhav bahut hi badhiya he
 Bullion Merchants Association General Secretary Srikrishna Goyal Chandiwala said that this may not be a good opportunity to buy silver as this Diwali silver is at its lowest level
 isaki kharidari har drushti se behatar he
 There is nothing better than this for investment
 unhone salaah di ki chaandi kii jewelri yaa vishwasaneey dukaan se sikke bhi kharide ja sakate hai
 Their shopping is a profitable deal
 chaandi kaa upyog audyogic saamaanon ke nirmaan tathaa kuch electronic saamaanon main bhi hota he
 Therefore, there are chances of increasing its prices
 unhone bataaya ki chaandi ke sikke dilli ke thok bazaar main somvaar ko 1,000 rupye prati sau sikke bad gaye the
 These had increased to Rs 70,000 per hundred
 in bhaavon par bhi isaki kharidari main budhimaani he
 Apart from this, if you buy something you need but it will not be appropriate to buy goods indiscriminately
 jyotishacharya praveen mishra kaa kahana he ki agar aap chaandi kharidte hai to yah sahi he kyonki dhanteras par dhaatu khareednaa tark sammat he
 He said that clay lamps and idols of Lakshmi and Ganesh should also be purchased today
 80 saal ke itihaas main pehali baar, ranjai trophy group e ke match main jammu-kashmir ne mumbai par aitihaasik jeet darj kii he
 jammu-kashmir defeated Mumbai by four wickets under the captaincy of Pervez Rasool at the Wankhede Stadium
 is shandaar jeet se rajya ke mukhyamantri umr abdulla khaase khush hai or unhone twitor par team ko jeet ke liye badhai bhi di
 The Jammu and Kashmir cricket team also suffered a lot due to the flood just before the Ranji season
 khilaadi vyaktigat taur par to pareshaan the hi, unka stadium bhi talab main tabdeel ho chukaa tha, or aise main unhone nagpur or duusari jagahon par camp lagaakar apni dhar paini kii
 Worked so hard that the 40-time Ranji Trophy champion beat Mumbai in his home, that is, the Wankhede Stadium
 is jeet ke baad jammu-kashmir ke captain parvaiz rasul ne kaha, ''mumbai ko mumbai main haraana badi uplabdhi he
 
 
 Our graph has grown rapidly in the last two-three years, we were told that playing in the elite division after the plate is different, but we have shown that we have the ability
 
 
 '' Mumbai scored 236 runs in the first innings thanks to the half-century captained by Surya Kumar Yadav, in response, Jammu and Kashmir team was all out for 254, giving them an 18-run lead
 mumbai ne duusari pari main captain surya kumaar yadav ke shatak kii badaulat 254 ran banaae, or ab rasul kii sena ko jeetne ke liye 237 ran banane the
 Chasing the target necessary for victory, Jammu and Kashmir were supposed to score 179 runs on the last day of this match played at Wankhede Stadium, with nine wickets left, reaching the target 73 minutes after lunch
 vaise, jammu-kashmir kii shuruyaat acchhee nahin rahi thi, tisare din ke naabad ballebaaj bandeep singh jaldi out ho gaye, iske baad haalanki ian singh or pehali pari ke shatakaveer shubham khajuriya ne tisare wicket ke liye 52 ran jode
 Ian Singh was sent to the pavilion by Vishal Dabholkar on a score of 30
 vahiin pehali pari main 107 ran banane vaale khajuriya 140 gend main 10 chaukon or ek chakke kii madad se 78 ran banaakar ikbaal abdulla ko ritern kaich dekar pavilion laute
 Khajuria then shared a 53-run partnership for the fourth wicket with captain Parvez Rasool
 rasul bhi 38 gend main 32 ran banaakar dabholkar kaa doosraa shikaar bane
 Both wickets fell to a score of 171, but Hardeep Singh scored an unbeaten 44 to take Jammu and Kashmir to victory
 jeet main ramadayal jaise gendbaaj kaa bhi khaasaa yogadan rahaa, jinhone match main aath wicket apane naam kiye
 On the performance of his bowlers, coach Sunil Joshi said, "it is a big thing to bowl like this on this pitch, these players have worked really hard
" yah jeet jammu-kashmir ke liye ek saugat he

 He will live for eternity

 On Tuesday , the Bihar BJP not only came out in support of Arun Jaitley but also demanded Darbhanga to take action against party parliamentarian Kirti Azad and all those leaders who are publicly criticizing the party with their statements
 bihar bijepi ke varisht netaa or vidhaan mandal dal ke netaa susheel modi ne twit kar kaha ki ye sansad apane bayanon se vipakshi dalon ke haath main khel rahe hai
 The comments nishchit rup se is bayaan se jetali khush honge
 Sushil Modi has been close to him and Jaitley has played the role of a political mentor after Govindacharya in his political life
 aane vaale dinon main kirti ke khilaaf party karwaai bhi kar degi, lekin sawaal he ki susheel modi ne party ke anya saansadon ke khilaaf bhi karwaai kii maang kii hai, usase lag rahaa hai ki unhen andaja hai ki kirti ke khilaaf karwaai hone par kendriya netritv or susheel modi ke ravaiye se naaraaz bihar se bijepi saansadon kaa naaraaz gut mukhar ho saktaa hai or unhen bhi muh kholane ke liye abhi se chetavanee de di gai he
 Party experts believe that a parliament like Rajkumar Singh can come out in support of him when he gets an action against Kirti Azad, which can further exacerbate the leadership
 lekin, party main jitna uthaa pathak hoga uskaa sidhaa laabh bhi aane vaale dinon main unke virodhiyon nitish or lalu ko mil saktaa he
 Jaitley would certainly be happy with this statement
 susheel modi unke kareebi rahe hai or unke raajnneetik jivan main govindacharya ke baad jetali ne raajnneetik guru kii bhoomika adaa kii hai
 In the coming days, the party will also take action against Kirti, but the question is whether Sushil Modi has demanded action against other mps of the party as well, it seems that he is aware that the central leadership if the action is taken against Kirti And angry with the attitude of Sushil Modi, the angry faction of BJP mps from Bihar may be outspoken and they too have been warned from now on
 party ke jaankaron kaa manana he ki kirti aaazaad ke khilaaf karwaai hone par rajkumaar singh jaise sansad unke samarthan main khul kar aa sakate hai jisase netritv kii parashani or bad sakati he
 But, there will be a direct benefit for the rise in the party, in the coming days, their opponents Nitish and Lalu can also get it

 In the last one month, the government has firmly maintained its answer that this decision is going to lay the foundation of running in a new way by erasing what had been going on for 70 years

 The Finance Minister says that the Prime Minister could have chosen the easy path like other Prime Ministers, but he chose the difficult path

 This will give banks more funds to lend
 aatankwaad se ladane kii baat kii jagah ab cashles, les cash or bainkon ke paas fund kii baton ne le lee he
 But banks have funds but even after a month, people in queues in front of banks are asking where their funds are
 kataron tasviren notebandi kii pratik tasviir bani hui hai
 There is a claim of supply of notes but atms are closed at various places
 bhartiya reserve bank ne bataaya he ki 10 november se 5 disambar ke bich abhi tak 3 lakh 81 hajaar karod mulya ke nae noton kii supplai kii ja chuki he
 The daily currency of demonetisation of November 8 was worth 15 lakh crore
 bhartiya rigerv bank kaa kahana he ki pichley teen saal main jitne noton kii supplai hui he usase zyada tees din se kam samay main kii gai he
 Even taking an average at this pace, it may take four to five months for the government to exchange new notes in exchange for old ones
 media report main atm mashin se sambandhit ek company ne daawa kiya gaya he ki 95 pratishat atm mashin ko 500 or 2000 rupee ke nae noton ke vitaran ke yogya bana diya gaya he phir bhi 35 fisadi atm main hi cash he
 In most places banks maintained the system with the help of local police, yet reports of people dying due to the emergence of health problems due to the line kept coming

 One side is saying that everyone is in support of the decision, while the other side is saying that people are very upset
 unka paisa unheen ko nahin mil rahaa he
 In Ludhiana, the woman who went to the bank to get money for her daughter's wedding, died of a heart attack

 ritred faujee cash lene ke liye atm ke baahar khadey the
 When they started going inside, the soldier was enraged and misbehaved with them
 aaropee sipaahi ko suspend kar diya gaya he
 By the way, people generally maintained order in front of banks
 police ne bhi kaaphi mushkilon kaa saamana kiya hoga
 It was alleged that the government took this decision without preparation, many people were saying that the decision was fine but there was no preparation to implement it but on Wednesday the Reserve Bank of India said that the decision of demonetization was not in haste Was taken rather after discussing every aspect in detail
 is bich sarkaar cashles system ko lekar kaaphi sakriy ho gai he
 People have also become active on their behalf
 mahanagaron se lekar kasbon tak main logon ne mobile wolet downlod kiya he
 Their demand has increased significantly
 state bank aaf india ko hi har din 50,000 swip mashin kaa order aa rahaa he
 Demand is high and supply is now complaining
 buudhvaar ke iconomik times main khabar chhapi thi ki 8 november ke pehle swip mashin se har din teen lakh len-dein hota tha, ab 15 lakh ho gaya he
 The number of swipes has increased but the average value per swipe transaction has fallen considerably
 pehle jab kam log debit card kaa istamaal karte the to prati len-dein 2700 rupee kharch karte the
 Now people are buying 2000 per swipe
 agar yah aankada sahi he to log card kaa istamaal to kar rahe hai lekin kharch nahin kar rahe hai
 Credit cards and debit cards also have a spending limit
 upabhokta kii aarthik haisiyat se vah seemaa tay hoti he
 The words of the finance minister are that it is an economic cast to deal with cash and this is why the government and banks try to use digital currency more and more
 digital karency matlab debit card credit card
 Finance Minister has said that 0 on buying petrol and diesel from card, e-wallet
 75 pratishat kaa discount milegaa
 The government will provide two point of sale machines free of cost to every village with a population of 10,000
 isse 75 karod log is mashin ke daayre main aa jaaenge
 0 for purchasing tickets through digital mode to train passengers from suburbs from 1 January
 5 pratishat kii chhot milegi
 Rail passengers buying tickets online will get 10 lakh insurance
 aan line rail tikat kharidne par katering or railway ritearing room ke kiraaye main 5 pratishat kii chhot milegi
 There will be no service charge if you purchase 2000 from the card
 aanaline ke jariye saarvajanik kshetra kii beemaa companiyon kaa premium dene waalon ko 8 se 10 pratishat kii chhot milegi
 Those who make digital payments at the toll plaza will get a rebate of 10 percent
 in riyaayaton ke bagaiyr hi digital bhugtan ke madhyamon main oochaal kii khabaren aa rahi thim
 Then why has the government given a rebate of up to 10 per cent at some point
 hotel sector bhi swip mashin ko lekar chintit hai ki apni kamai se do pratishat kyon den
 Will the government give them a discount too? yah bhi saaf nahin he ki yah chhot kab tak ke liye he
 Is for a few days or permanently
 vitt mantri ne kaha ki aap roj 1800 rupee kaa petrol dijal kharidte hai
 After demonetisation, 360 million purchases are being made through digital medium
 agar yahi kharidari 540 karod kii rose hone lage to ek saal main petrol dijal kii kharidari main hi do lakh karod cash kii maang ghat jaaegi
 The comments ham nahin jaanate ki baaki sector main kitne sau karod kaa len-dein digital hua he or uske aadhaar par saal main kitne lakh karod cash kii kami aa jaaegi
 We have to see in which sector the increase in digital payment has taken place
 matlab agar 100 nae logon ne card kaa istemaal kiya he to inamen se zyaadaatar petrol bharaa rahe hai yaa or bhi chijen kharid rahe hai
 In which account will be shown the losses that have been lost to small to medium and large industries during this period, how will all these sectors compensate
 ham yah bhi samajhane kaa prayaas karen ki notebandi ke roj agar saadhe 15 lakh ke aasapaas karency chalan main thi, agar inamen se ab tak saadhe gyaarah lakh karod mulya kii karency bainkon main aa gai he to iske kya myne hai
 If all the money comes to the banks then why is it believed that the government's campaign will not be successful
 kya hamen yah bhi maananaa hoga ki bainkon main jo paisa aayaa vah safed hi tha
 The government says that the accounts will be strictly investigated
 kuch khaaton kii to ho rahi he lekin kya iskar vibhaagon main itane karmchaaree hai jo in karodon khaaton kii jaanch kar sakenge
 How many days will you do it
 doosraa sawaal he ki vitt mantri do lakh karod cash ke chalan ko kam karke kya hasil karnaa chaahate hai, saadhe 15 lakh karod kii karency main se agar do lakh karod kii karency digital ho jaae to sarkaar kaa koun sa makasad puraa hota he
 Media is writing cashless but keep in mind that the government is talking about lace cash
 baad main mat kahiega ki sarkaar ne cashles kaha tha
 We or you can see a figure and how the digital payment that was happening before 8 November was worth lakhs of crores
 usase cash kii jarurat main kitni kami aa rahi thi
 These are all questions
 vitt mantri kaa kahana he ki pradhanmantri anya pradhanmantriyon kii tarah aasaan rasta chun sakate the, magar unhone mushkil rasta chunaa
 There is regret about the suffering that has taken place in this transition period, but this step will lead to a clean economy and better GDP
 isse bainkon ko paas karj dene ke liye adhik fund honge
 The talk of fighting terrorism has now been replaced by cashless, less cash and funds with banks
 magar bainkon ke paas fund to he lekin ek maheene baad bhi bainkon ke aage kataron main lage log puch rahe hai ki unka fund kahaan hai
 The queue photos remain the symbol of demonetisation
 noton kii supplai kaa daawa he lekin jagah-jagah atm band pade hai
 The Reserve Bank of India has stated that between 10 November and 5 December, so far new notes worth 3 lakh 81 thousand crore have been supplied
 aath november kii notebandi ke roj saadhe 15 lakh karod mulya kii karency chalan main thi
 The Reserve Bank of India says that more notes have been supplied in less than thirty days in the last three years
 is raftaar se bhi ausat nikaalen to sarkaar ko puraane noton ke badale nae note utaarne main chaar se paanch maheene lag sakate hai
 In media reports, a company related to the ATM machine has claimed that 95 percent of the ATM machines have been made eligible for distribution of new notes of 500 and 2000 rupees, yet 35 percent of the atms have cash only
 zyaadaatar jagahon par bainkon ne sthaneey police kii madad se vyavastha banaae rakhi phir bhi line main lagane se swasthya samasyaon ke ubhar aane se marane waalon kii khabaren bhi aati hi raheen
 There was also news of a child being born in the line itself
 isko lekar ek paksh kah rahaa he ki sab faisle ke samarthan main he to doosraa paksh kah rahaa he ki log kaaphi pareshaan hai
 They are not getting their money

 Retired soldiers were standing outside the ATM to collect cash
 jab ve andar jane lage to sipaahi bhadak gaya or unke saath badasluki kii
 The accused soldier has been suspended
 vaise aamtaur par bainkon ke aage logon ne vyavastha banaae rakhi
 The police may have faced a lot of difficulties
 notebandi ko lekar yah aarope lag rahaa tha ki sarkaar ne bina taiyaari ke yah faisla le liya, kai log kah rahe the ki faisla thik tha magar lagu karne kii taiyaari nahin thi lekin buudhvaar ko bhartiya rigerv bank ne kaha ki notebandi kaa faisla jaldibaji main nahin liya gaya tha balki vistaar se har pahalu par vichaar vimarsh ke baad liya gaya tha
 Meanwhile, the government has become very active about the cashless system
 log bhi apni taraf se sakriy ho gaye hai
 People have downloaded mobile wallets from metros to towns
 inaki maang main kaaphi teji ai he
 The State Bank of India is receiving orders for 50,000 swipe machines every day
 maang adhik he or ab aapurti kii shikaayat he
 In the Economic Times of Wednesday, there was a news that before 8 November swipe machine used to have three lakh transactions every day, now it has become 1
5 million
 swip kii sankhya to bad gai he magar prati swip len-dein kaa ausat mulya kaaphi gir gaya he
 Earlier, when fewer people used debit cards, they used to spend Rs 2700 per transaction
 ab log prati swip 2000 kii hi kharidari kar rahe hai
 If this figure is correct then people are using the card but are not spending it
 credit card or debit card se kharch kii bhi seemaa hoti he
 That limit is determined by the economic status of the consumer
 vitt mantri ke hi shabd hai ki cash ke saath-saath deal karnaa iskaa ek iconomik cast bhi he isliye sarkaar or bank prayaas karte hai ki digital karency kaa zyada se zyada istemaal kiya jaae
 Digital currency means debit card credit card
 vitt mantri ne kaha he ki card, i-wolet se petrol or dijal kharidne par 0
 There will be a 75 percent discount
 sarkaar 1 xxrep 4 0 kii aabaadi vaale har gaanv ko do point aaf cell mashin muft degi
 This will bring 75 crore people under this machine
 ek janvari se upnagaron ke railyatriyon ko digital madhyam se tikat kharidne par 0
 5 percent discount will be available
 aanaline tikat kharidne vaale rail yatriyon ko 10 lakh kaa beemaa milegaa
 There will be a discount of 5 percent in the fare of catering and railway retiring rooms for purchasing online train tickets
 agar card se 2000 kii kharidari karenge to koi seva shulk nahin lagegaa
 Through online, the premiums of public sector insurance companies will get 8 to 10 percent discount
 toll plaza par digital pement karne waalon ko 10 pratishat kii chhot milegi
 Without these concessions, there were reports of a surge in digital payment channels
 phir sarkaar ne kahin maamuli to kahin 10 pratishat tak kii chhot kyon di he
 The hotel sector is also concerned about the swipe machine as to why give two percent of its earnings
 kya sarkaar unhen bhi chhot degi
 It is also not clear how long this exemption is for
 kuch dinon ke liye he yaa sthai rup se
 The Finance Minister said that you buy petrol diesel worth Rs 1800 per day
 notebandi ke baad 360 karod kii kharidari digital madhyam se ho rahi he
 If this purchase starts daily of 540 crores, then the demand of two lakh crores cash will be reduced in the purchase of petrol diesel in a year
 tippaniyan We do not know how many hundred crore transactions have gone digital in the rest of the sector and based on that, how many lakh crores of cash will be reduced in a year
 hamen dekhnaa hoga ki digital pement main jo vruddhi hui he, vah kis sector main hui he
 Meaning if 100 new people have used the card, then most of them are filling petrol or buying more things
 laghu se lekar madhyam or bade udyogon ko jo is dauraan ghaataa hua he, vah kis khate main hisaab dikhaaya jayega, uski bharpai yah tamaam sector kaise karenge
 Let us also try to understand that if the currency of demonetisation was in circulation around 15 lakhs and a half, if it has come to the banks worth eleven and a half lakhs of rupees, then what does it mean? agar sara paisa bainkon main aa gaya to kyon mana ja rahaa he ki sarkaar kaa abhiyaan safal nahin hoga
 Do we also have to believe that the money that came into the banks was white
 sarkaar kahati he ki khaaton kii sakhti se jaanch hogi
 Some accounts are being done, but are there so many employees in income tax departments who will be able to check these crores of accounts
 kitne dinon main kar lenge
 The second question is what the Finance Minister wants to achieve by reducing the circulation of two lakh crores of cash, out of the Rs
 1
5 lakh crores, if two lakh crores of currency becomes digital, then what is the purpose of the government
 media cashles likh rahaa he lekin dhyaan rakhiegaa sarkaar les cash kii baat kar rahi he
 Do not later say that the government was called cashless
 ham yaa aap ek aankada or dekh sakate hai ki 8 november se pehle jo digital bhugtan ho rahaa tha vah kitne lakh karod kaa tha
 There was a decrease in cash requirement from him
 yah sab sawaal hai
 In media reports, a company related to the ATM machine has claimed that 95 percent of the ATM machines have been made eligible for distribution of new notes of 500 and 2000 rupees, yet 35 percent of the atms have cash only

 The comments ham nahin jaanate ki baaki sector main kitne sau karod kaa len-dein digital hua he or uske aadhaar par saal main kitne lakh karod cash kii kami aa jaaegi
 We have to see in which sector the increase in digital payment has taken place
 matlab agar 100 nae logon ne card kaa istemaal kiya he to inamen se zyaadaatar petrol bharaa rahe hai yaa or bhi chijen kharid rahe hai
 In which account will be shown the losses that have been lost to small to medium and large industries during this period, how will all these sectors compensate
 ham yah bhi samajhane kaa prayaas karen ki notebandi ke roj agar saadhe 15 lakh ke aasapaas karency chalan main thi, agar inamen se ab tak saadhe gyaarah lakh karod mulya kii karency bainkon main aa gai he to iske kya myne hai
 If all the money comes to the banks then why is it believed that the government's campaign will not be successful
 kya hamen yah bhi maananaa hoga ki bainkon main jo paisa aayaa vah safed hi tha
 The government says that the accounts will be strictly investigated
 kuch khaaton kii to ho rahi he lekin kya iskar vibhaagon main itane karmchaaree hai jo in karodon khaaton kii jaanch kar sakenge
 How many days will you do it
 doosraa sawaal he ki vitt mantri do lakh karod cash ke chalan ko kam karke kya hasil karnaa chaahate hai, saadhe 15 lakh karod kii karency main se agar do lakh karod kii karency digital ho jaae to sarkaar kaa koun sa makasad puraa hota he
 Media is writing cashless but keep in mind that the government is talking about lace cash
 baad main mat kahiega ki sarkaar ne cashles kaha tha
 We or you can see a figure and how the digital payment that was happening before 8 November was worth lakhs of crores
 usase cash kii jarurat main kitni kami aa rahi thi
 These are all questions
 karnataka ke bagalkot jile ke ek bank ke atm ke baahar buudhvaar ko sipaahi ne ritred faujee 55 saal ke nandappa ko dhakka diya or marpet kii
 Retired soldiers were standing outside the ATM to collect cash
 jab ve andar jane lage to sipaahi bhadak gaya or unke saath badasluki kii
 The accused soldier has been suspended
 vaise aamtaur par bainkon ke aage logon ne vyavastha banaae rakhi
 The police may have faced a lot of difficulties
 notebandi ko lekar yah aarope lag rahaa tha ki sarkaar ne bina taiyaari ke yah faisla le liya, kai log kah rahe the ki faisla thik tha magar lagu karne kii taiyaari nahin thi lekin buudhvaar ko bhartiya rigerv bank ne kaha ki notebandi kaa faisla jaldibaji main nahin liya gaya tha balki vistaar se har pahalu par vichaar vimarsh ke baad liya gaya tha
 Meanwhile, the government has become very active about the cashless system
 log bhi apni taraf se sakriy ho gaye hai
 People have downloaded mobile wallets from metros to towns
 inaki maang main kaaphi teji ai he
 The State Bank of India is receiving orders for 50,000 swipe machines every day
 maang adhik he or ab aapurti kii shikaayat he
 In the Economic Times of Wednesday, there was a news that before 8 November swipe machine used to have three lakh transactions every day, now it has become 1
5 million
 swip kii sankhya to bad gai he magar prati swip len-dein kaa ausat mulya kaaphi gir gaya he
 Earlier, when fewer people used debit cards, they used to spend Rs 2700 per transaction
 ab log prati swip 2000 kii hi kharidari kar rahe hai
 If this figure is correct then people are using the card but are not spending it
 credit card or debit card se kharch kii bhi seemaa hoti he
 That limit is determined by the economic status of the consumer
 vitt mantri ke hi shabd hai ki cash ke saath-saath deal karnaa iskaa ek iconomik cast bhi he isliye sarkaar or bank prayaas karte hai ki digital karency kaa zyada se zyada istemaal kiya jaae
 Digital currency means debit card credit card
 vitt mantri ne kaha he ki card, i-wolet se petrol or dijal kharidne par 0
 There will be a 75 percent discount
 sarkaar 1 xxrep 4 0 kii aabaadi vaale har gaanv ko do point aaf cell mashin muft degi
 This will bring 75 crore people under this machine
 ek janvari se upnagaron ke railyatriyon ko digital madhyam se tikat kharidne par 0
 5 percent discount will be available
 aanaline tikat kharidne vaale rail yatriyon ko 10 lakh kaa beemaa milegaa
 There will be a discount of 5 percent in the fare of catering and railway retiring rooms for purchasing online train tickets
 agar card se 2000 kii kharidari karenge to koi seva shulk nahin lagegaa
 Through online, the premiums of public sector insurance companies will get 8 to 10 percent discount
 toll plaza par digital pement karne waalon ko 10 pratishat kii chhot milegi
 Without these concessions, there were reports of a surge in digital payment channels
 phir sarkaar ne kahin maamuli to kahin 10 pratishat tak kii chhot kyon di he
 The hotel sector is also concerned about the swipe machine as to why give two percent of its earnings
 kya sarkaar unhen bhi chhot degi
 It is also not clear how long this exemption is for
 kuch dinon ke liye he yaa sthai rup se
 The Finance Minister said that you buy petrol diesel worth Rs 1800 per day
 notebandi ke baad 360 karod kii kharidari digital madhyam se ho rahi he
 If this purchase starts daily of 540 crores, then the demand of two lakh crores cash will be reduced in the purchase of petrol diesel in a year
 tippaniyan We do not know how many hundred crore transactions have gone digital in the rest of the sector and based on that, how many lakh crores of cash will be reduced in a year
 hamen dekhnaa hoga ki digital pement main jo vruddhi hui he, vah kis sector main hui he
 Meaning if 100 new people have used the card, then most of them are filling petrol or buying more things
 laghu se lekar madhyam or bade udyogon ko jo is dauraan ghaataa hua he, vah kis khate main hisaab dikhaaya jayega, uski bharpai yah tamaam sector kaise karenge
 Let us also try to understand that if the currency of demonetisation was in circulation around 15 lakhs and a half, if it has come to the banks worth eleven and a half lakhs of rupees, then what does it mean? agar sara paisa bainkon main aa gaya to kyon mana ja rahaa he ki sarkaar kaa abhiyaan safal nahin hoga
 Do we also have to believe that the money that came into the banks was white
 sarkaar kahati he ki khaaton kii sakhti se jaanch hogi
 Some accounts are being done, but are there so many employees in income tax departments who will be able to check these crores of accounts
 kitne dinon main kar lenge
 The second question is what the Finance Minister wants to achieve by reducing the circulation of two lakh crores of cash, out of the Rs
 1
5 lakh crores, if two lakh crores of currency becomes digital, then what is the purpose of the government
 media cashles likh rahaa he lekin dhyaan rakhiegaa sarkaar les cash kii baat kar rahi he
 Do not later say that the government was called cashless
 ham yaa aap ek aankada or dekh sakate hai ki 8 november se pehle jo digital bhugtan ho rahaa tha vah kitne lakh karod kaa tha
 There was a decrease in cash requirement from him
 yah sab sawaal hai
 By the way, people generally maintained order in front of banks
 police ne bhi kaaphi mushkilon kaa saamana kiya hoga
 It was alleged that the government took this decision without preparation, many people were saying that the decision was fine but there was no preparation to implement it but on Wednesday the Reserve Bank of India said that the decision of demonetization was not in haste Was taken rather after discussing every aspect in detail
 is bich sarkaar cashles system ko lekar kaaphi sakriy ho gai he
 People have also become active on their behalf
 mahanagaron se lekar kasbon tak main logon ne mobile wolet downlod kiya he
 Their demand has increased significantly
 state bank aaf india ko hi har din 50,000 swip mashin kaa order aa rahaa he
 Demand is high and supply is now complaining
 buudhvaar ke iconomik times main khabar chhapi thi ki 8 november ke pehle swip mashin se har din teen lakh len-dein hota tha, ab 15 lakh ho gaya he
 The number of swipes has increased but the average value per swipe transaction has fallen considerably
 pehle jab kam log debit card kaa istamaal karte the to prati len-dein 2700 rupee kharch karte the
 Now people are buying 2000 per swipe
 agar yah aankada sahi he to log card kaa istamaal to kar rahe hai lekin kharch nahin kar rahe hai
 Credit cards and debit cards also have a spending limit
 upabhokta kii aarthik haisiyat se vah seemaa tay hoti he
 The words of the finance minister are that it is an economic cast to deal with cash and this is why the government and banks try to use digital currency more and more
 digital karency matlab debit card credit card
 Finance Minister has said that 0 on buying petrol and diesel from card, e-wallet

 'S Raut on being asked 'why it's taking time to form govt despite pre-poll alliance with BJP': There is no Dushyant here whose father is in jail

 The Samajwadi Party continued to see a decline in seats from vote to vote percentage and the Lok Sabha results on Thursday pushed the Samajwadi Party to the third position
 mayawati kii party bispi jo pichley loksabhaa chunaav or vidhansabha chunaav main safaaye kii sthiti main aa gai thi, wo is baar loksabhaa chunaav main kuch had tak apni vaapasi karaane main safal rahi
 With more than 20% votes and 10 seats, Mayawati managed to save both the party and the credibility
 loksabhaa chunaav ke nateezon se yah sawaal lajimi ho gaya ki kya akhilesh yadav apni chamak or pita kii raajnneetik viraasat lagaataar khote ja rahe hai
 This is rarely the case in politics when one puts one's entire political earnings at stake and creates future politics
 akhilesh yadav ne ye jokhim liya or vidhansabha chunaav main haar ke baad mayawati se gathbandhan kaa jo daanv khelaa wo bhi ulta hi padaa
 Once again everyone flew in the Modi wave
 2014 main akele ladakar samaajawaadee party ne 5 siten jiti thim or is baar mayawati ke saath lard kar bhi sirf 5 siten hi jeetin, pichhali baar paanchon parivaar ke log apni siten bachaa paae the is baar 5 main se akhilesh kii patni dimpal yadav sahit teenon sadasyon ne apni seat bhi gavaan di
 Akhilesh was in loss but it benefited Mayawati, BSP reached minus 10
 mayawati vipaksh kii iklauti aisi netaa hai jinhone loksabhaa chunaav ke nateezon ke baad press se baat kii
 Although Mayawati did not wish Prime Minister Modi the victory, but did share the pain of Akhilesh
 akhilesh yadav apane party ke sarvesarva hai
 Those who have opinions in the party against Akhilesh have now left the party
 bhale hi akhilesh yadav par is haar ke baad bhi party ke bheetar se koi sawaal nahin uthenge lekin yah haar samaajawaadee party ko andar tak hilaa chuki he
 Two large regional forces in the same state across the country had not done such an alliance against Modi
 puure desh main modi kaa vijay rath rokane kii ummid bhi isi gathbandhan par tiki thi
 Uttar Pradesh was the same in the entire country where the transfer of votes was also visible on the ground
 itnaa hone ke baavjood agar samaajawaadee party apane kad ko badhaane main safal nahin rahi to sawaal akhilesh yadav ke gathbandhan ke faisle par uthne laazmi he
 Questions will also arise as to how far it was right for the alliance to bend itself and where the political settlement was right
 is gathbandhan ke mul main yah bhaavana kaam kar rahi thi ki is gathbandhan ke baad mayawati dilli kaa rukh karengi or akhilesh yadav ke liye uttar pradesh main raah banaayengi
 But now that Mayawati has once again emerged as strong with double strength, the alliance of Muslim Dalits was the most successful
 aise main akhilesh yadav ke liye 2022 main gathbandhan kii taraf se daavedaari karnaa aasaan nahin hoga
 The voice will also be vocal within the Mulayam Singh family
 or party main bhi
 But in this post-mortem of defeat, it will be interesting to see how much importance Akhilesh gives to him if the modalities of the alliance are questioned
 congress main apana puraa raajnneetik jivan guzarkar putr moh ke kaaran bijepi main shaamil hue narayan dutt tiwari ko bijepi ne jhatka de diya
 The 91-year-old ND Tiwari, who was the chief minister of UP and Uttarakhand, was left with a hand in the hope of getting his son Rohit Shekhar a ticket in the assembly elections
 unhone shaayad sochaa hoga ki jivan kii is sandhya vela main bete ko bhartiya raajnneeti main sthapit kar jaaen
 However, call it a coincidence or a thoughtful strategy that the BJP put an end to the dreams of Tiwari and his son by announcing the remaining 6 tickets at the last minute
 raajnneeti ke dronacharya hi kha gaye maatatin baar uttar pradesh or ek baar uttarakhand ke mukhyamantri rah chuke narayan dutt tiwari ne yun to bahuton ko raajnneeti kaa paath sikhaaya- padhaayaa, lekin is baar lagata he vah khud raajnneeti kaa shikaar ho gaye
 They themselves would never have thought so
 putr prem ke hi kaaran tiwari kabhi apane hi mukhyamantri ke khilaaf maunvrat par baithe, to kabhi bhukh hadtaal par
 
 
 Every step his son was trying to achieve right political position, but the BJP cut his son's ticket and gave a clear indication that now the politics has changed, there is something more visible and something more
 
 
 bharat or srilanka ke bich samandar main pul jaisaa dikhne vaala dhaancha kisne or kab banaaya yaa yah prakritik rup se bana yah rahasy bahut purana he, jisko lekar kai tarah kii baaten kahi jaati rahi hai
 Many people believe that this bridge, known as Ram Sethu, was built by Lord Rama when he was going to war in Sri Lanka
 lekin thik gujarat chunaav kii gahamagahami ke bich bahut puraane is rahasy ko lekar ek baar phir nae sire se bahes chhid gai he
 The reason for the fresh debate is that a science channel of America has said in its report that the stones found in Ram Sethu are actually older than the sand in the sea there
 is report ke aane ke baad bijepi netaaon main khushi kii lahar daud gai he or unhen congress party par hamalaa karne kaa ek or mauka mil gaya he
 The issue of Ram Sethu has also been hot because Rahul Gandhi is constantly visiting temples in Gujarat elections and describing himself as a Shiva devotee
 kanoon mantri ravishankar prasad ne buudhvaar ko ajtak se khaas baatcheet main kaha ki bharat kii aasthaa vigyaan se alag nahin he
 For thousands of years, if the people of the country have believed the story of Rama, they have accepted the affection of Krishna
 ab to vigyaan ne bhi isaki pushti kar di he
 He said that we never had any doubt about it
 aaj to cambodia, sumatra or malaysia main bhi ram katha kahi jaati he
 But there are some people who were questioning the existence of Ram Sethu
 upie sarkaar kaa zikr karte hue ravishankar prasad ne yaad dilaayaa ki pichhali sarkaar ne court main halafanama diya tha ki ramsetu kaa koi astitv nahin he
 He had demanded that now the Congress party should reply in this regard
 rahul gandhi kemandiron menjakar darshan karne par sawaal uthaate hue ravishankar prasad ne poocha ki rahul gandhi gujarat main shiv bhakthi kii baat kar rahe hai, lekin unki rambhakti kyon dolati he
 When asked about going to temples in a press conference, Rahul Gandhi said that there is a ban on going to the temple? After this Ravi Shankar Prasad asked him if he ever went to see Ram Lala in Uttar Pradesh? Ever went to see Krishna's birthplace? While expressing happiness over the report about Ram Sethu, Ravi Shankar Prasad said that it is a matter of pleasure for us that scientists of America today have tested the test of science and said that this stone is also from the sand of the sea
 Are old
 unhone kaha he ki ramsetu prakritik nahin he balki vahaan pathar insaanon ne rakhaa he unhone kaha ki hamaare liye bahut badi jeet he hamaare liye bahut badi baat he
 Forget the Burj Khalifa, the world's largest skyscraper located in Dubai
 ab nai sansani yah he ki china main ek aisi lift banaai ja rahi he jo aapako 95veen manzil tak sirf 43 second main pahunchaa degi
 In the 111-floor skyscraper in Quangcho, China, the Japanese company Hitachi is building two elevators that will take the 95th floor in 43 seconds of dawn
 bibisi kii report ke mutabik yah lift duniya kii sabase tej gati vaali lift hogi
 It will have a speed of 72 kilometers per hour

 Currently the fastest speed lift is in Taipei 101 (formerly named - Taipei World Financial Center)
 yahaan lift 60 kilometre prati ghante kii raftaar se chalati he

 After this, the young man escaped from the spot after admitting the student to a private hospital near Dev Colony

 ek taraf loksabhaa chunaav 2019 ke liye uttar pradesh main buaa, babua or choudhary kii tikdi milakar bijepi ko chunauti dene kii taiyaari kar rahi hai, jahaan congress ko saath lene yaa nahin lene par abhi tasviir saaf nahin he
 In such a situation, the Congress is on a high pitch for UP
 haalanki, sutron ke mutabik, bade netaa is masale ko abhi jaldbaaji bharaa maanate hai
 It is time for the Lok Sabha elections
 13 farvari ko jab antarim bajet vaala satr khatm hoga, uske baad hi sahi tasviir saamne aegi
 Political sources say that after that the name of the government will be just a formality and the investigating agencies are merely mute spectators
 iske baavjood congress ke bheetar mahagathbandhan ko lekar doraay bani hui he
 The first opinion is of the big leaders of Delhi and the big contenders for the Lok Sabha elections, who want the Congress to be part of the grand alliance in any case
 isse bijepi ke khilaaf voton kaa bikharaav nahin hoga
 At the same time, the Congress will also be able to give a message to the opposition parties to take along
 haalia ghatnakramon par is dhade kaa kahana he ki yah siyasat he or ek-duusare par dabaav bananaa or aakhri pattey ko dil ke kareeb rakhana, phir mauka padane par kholana iskaa mul siddhant he
 Anyway, recently the elections of the three big states of the Hindi belt and after the elections, the sp-bsp's rivalry with the Congress has been well known
 isliye jaldbaaji main kisi nattejey par nahin pahunchnaa chahie
 At the same time, there is another camp which is preparing to give its new argument to Congress President Rahul Gandhi and soon he will also present his side in front of the party president
 is kheme kii apni daleelein hai
 1
 2017 main sapa ke saath khulaa talmail nuksaandeh rahaa
 2
 ek taraf bijepi or duusari taraf baaki hone kii surat main bijepi dhruvikaran kaa daanv bhi khel sakati he
 3
 upi main shahari ilaako main kai siten aisi hai, jahaan ek tabaka rashtriya chunaav main rashtriya partiyon ko vot karata aayaa he
 In such a situation, in the absence of a Congress candidate in front of the BJP, the Congress vote can go to the BJP instead of the Grand Alliance
 4
 If the Congress or SP candidate does not become a Dalit in the event of a Mahagathbandhan, then he can turn to the BJP, in the same way, if the Yadav is not a candidate from the BSP or the Congress, this SP vote can go to the BJP
 aakhir is chunaav main modi kaa cheharaa bhi hoga
 5
 saath hi 1971 kii tarj par vipaksh ke indira hataao ke naare kii tarah modi hataao ke naare kii hawa nikal sakati he
 6
 loksabhaa chunaav main agar congress ummidavaar majboot hota he to alpsankhyak matadaataaon kii pehali pasand congress hoti he, jiskaa udhaaharan 2009 kaa chunaav he
 7
 2009 kii tarj par sapa-basapa se congress siton ke lihaaj se ranneetik talmail kare yani jahaan sapa-basapa gathjod bijepi ko haraane kii haalat main ho, vahaan congress bijepi ke vot kaatane vaala ummidavaar de de
 At the same time, where the Congress candidate is in a position to defeat the BJP, the SP-BSP should give the candidate who will cut the bjp's vote
 aise main philhal congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ke saamne do main se ek rasta chunane kii chunauti he, lekin unke kareebi maanate hai ki, pehla to wo nahin chaahate ki gathbandhan nahin hone kaa thikra congress par phute or doosraa yah ki abhi ganga main bahut pani bahna baaki he
 Also, he also believes that in politics, there is not only Plan A, Plan b and c too

 'it is written in the Gita that the body dies, the souls are always alive, but nowadays it is turning upside down, souls are dying due to which the sensations are also becoming zero
 agar atmaaen naa mar rahi hotin to doctors par koi jaldi ungali nahin uthaata
 Earlier it was not like this, people considered doctor as God
 'maiks healthkar ke doctor durgtosh pandey se milakar ghar laut rahaa tha to unki kahi ye line baraabar main man main goonjati raheen
 i was sitting in the front seat in the car
 chota bhai ajay gaadi chalaa rahaa tha
 i had my mother lying on the back seat with the help of several pillows and my father was holding them
 aaj maa ke taanke hataa die gaye the or unhone 15 din main pehali baar munh ke jariye chaay pi kyonki isse pehle pani kii ek boond bhi pipe ke zarie unke sharir main jaati thi
 This was probably the first day in the last 6 months when we were happy, very happy
 ham aapas main ek duusare ko bas dekhte or khidki ke shishe se baahar dekhne lagate taaki koi kisi ke aansu naa pard le
 One thing was clear in the minds of the three of us that there are still doctors like Dr
 Durgatosh Pandey, for whom being a doctor is not only a profession but also a responsibility
 pita kii ichha ko puraa kiyadoctor durgtosh ke pita dhanbad, jharkhand main kol india main kaam karte the or ye unki ichha thi ki unka betaa doctor bane
 Taking the father's wish as the objective, Durgatosh also decided that he would become a doctor
 dasvin kii padhai devgarh ke ramakrishna viapeeth se kii to jivan par aadhyatm kaa prabhaav padane laga
 Dr
 Durgatosh believes that the biggest effect of studying from this school of Deoghar was that he always took honesty with his profession

 Everything was fine then one day it was found out that his father had cancer
 doctor durgtosh khud cancer ke doctor the do baar oparation karnaa padaa lekin pita ko bachaaya nahin ja sakaa
 After the death of his father from cancer, Dr
 Durgatosh decided to fight against the disease itself
 jisaki jhalak maine tab dekhi jab main apni maa ko lekar unase opidi main mila karata tha
 They meet the patient's relatives in a very natural way
 marij ko ye abhas karaate hai ki cancer se ladaa ja saktaa he or ham ladenge
 The highest number of lung cancer among men, Doctor Durgatosh told that 90 percent of the deaths due to cancer at this time are due to lung cancer due to which the attitude of some doctors is also responsible
 unke mutabik jab bhi koi spot kisi ke fefdon main dekhtaa he zyaadaatar doctors use tivi maanakar uskaa ilaaj shuru kar dete hai
 And by the time it is revealed that it is cancer, not TV, it is late
 jabaki aisi kisi bhi sthiti main bina biopsy yaa thook kii jaanch ke kisi bhi nattejey par pahunchnaa ghaatak hota he
 Therefore, there is a need for great awareness about cancer
 unhone ye bhi kaha ki langs cancer ko lekar bhram bhi bahut he ki iskaailaaj lagbhag naammumkin he, jabaki aisa nahin he
 If vigilance is taken, this cancer can also be fought

 ) China, the world's largest economic power, is going through a period of lethargy
 lagaataar 30 saal tak 10 fisadi kii vikaas dar darj karne vaale china ko aarthik shakti banane main uske kuch provinces kii ahm bhoomika rahi he
 These states also contribute the most to the country's GDP
 khaas baat yah he ki aarthik aankadon ko dekhakar saaf he ki ye provins china kii sabase ghani aabaadi vaale kshetra hai or is ghani aabaadi ke sahare hi china duniya kii sabase badi arthvyavastha banane main safal hua he
 Uttar Pradesh is the most populous state in India by population
 lihajacheen jaisi arthvyavastaako pakadaney or use pachhaadne ke liye jaruri he ki bharat main bhi aarthik vikaas ke kendra main uttar pradesh rahe
 See in China's statistics why it is necessary for UP to become Gujarat
 china ke aarthik nakshe ke mutabik do pramukh kshetra east china or south central china main desh kii kul jansankhya kii 61 fisadi se adhik aabaadi he (38 karod jansankhya donon kshetra main)
 There are 6 important states of China in this region, which are the largest provinces (states) in the country by population
 2
 For the past 30 years (1978–2008), these provisions have given China double digit growth (over 10%), making it the world's largest economic power
 is kshetra main ahm 6 ahm provins guangdong, jiyangsu, shandong, jhenziyang, henon or sichuaan he
 3
 china ne baari jansankhya vaale in 6 provinces ko lagaataar 30 saal tak apni aarthik gatividhiyon ke kendra main rakhaa
 Factories in these states made China the manufacturing hub of the world
 china kii export aadhaarit arthvyavastha inhen provinces se sanchalit hoti rahi
 4
 2008 main vaishvik mandi ke baad se lagaataar china ke vikaas dar main giravat darj ho rahi he
 China's economic growth rate currently 6
 5 fisadi par pahunch chuki he or china sarkaar kaa daawa he ki uske dwaara chalaae ja rahe bade aarthik sudhaaron ke chalate agle 5 saal tak china kii aarthik vikaas dar 6 fisadi se adhik or 7 fisadi se kam rahegi
 5
 iske bajwood china kii ghani aabaadi vaale ye 6 provins abhi bhi 8 fisadi se adhik kii vikaas dar ke saath aage bad rahe hai
 Significantly, China is still the largest player in global development
 akele china kii arthvyavastha se duniya kii arthvyavastha kaa 40 fisadi hissaa aata he
 6
 vaishvik arthvyavastha main china ko pakadaney athwa pichhaadne ke liye jaruri he ki bharat main ghani aawaadi vaale rajyon koaarthik vikaas kii mukhyadharaamein rakhaa jaae
 For more than a decade, if Gujarat has become an economy growing at more than 10 percent pace, then it is necessary to become a world power to get the speed of Gujarat to those states where the population is dense

 Bariatric surgery for obese young men may make them attractive from the outside, but they may face many major risks later
 swasthya visheshgyon kaa kahana he ki sateek dekharekh ke abhaav main surgery ke baad kai saalon tak marijon ko kuposhan or anya kai sari shaareerik dikkatein aa sakati hai
 Bariatric surgery refers to an operation to lose weight
 akasar lambey samay se motaape kaa saamana karne vaale yaa motaape se sambandhit swasthya samasyaayein jaise ki madhumeh, ucch raktchaap, ucch cholestrol str or sleep epaniya se peedit log yah surgery karavaate hai
 Although bariatric surgery is of many types, surgeons commonly use three - roux-en-y gastric bypass, vertical sleeve gastrectomy and laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding
 surgery se jathrantra kshetra kii sanrachana main parivartan laayaa jaataa he, jisamen pet or pachanatantr bhi shaamil rahata he
 After this surgery the appetite starts to decrease due to which people use less amount of food, due to which the weight starts to decrease gradually
 aise main santulit jivan, poshak tatwon kaa seven or vyaayaam ke saath hi baat ban sakati he
 There are many side-effects of doing so now including infections, bone deformities, anemia, diarrhea, nutritional deficiency, stones, hernia, pregnancy trouble for women and premature baby birth
 dilli ke indraprastha apollo aspataal main minimali invesive surgery vibhaag ke varisht salaahkaar faijal mumtaj ke mutabik, barietric surgery yaa metabolic surgery mul rup se vajan kam karne vaali ek surgery he or diabetes ko thik karne main bhi yah madadgaar he
 Mumtaz told IANS, "these can be either a combination of a destructive or restrictive and a small amount of nutritional absorption
 pratibandhit barietric surgery pet ke aakaar ko kam kar detii he jisase upyog kii jane vaali bhojan kii maatra kam ho jaati he or kam khaane se hi pet bharne lag jaataa he
 "mumtaz further added," After bariatric surgery, it becomes very important to make lifestyle changes
 isamen swasthyavardhak bhojan kaa seven kiya janaa chahie or ek santulit jeevanstyli apanaai jaani chahie
 There is no need to take any special care, but just one thing needs to be kept in mind and that is to make exercise and healthy living a part of your daily routine
 " Nature also does something to some people that we cry out as soon as we see them

 The name of this teenager is Bhupinder Singh and people get scared either by seeing him or they are making ugly comments
 aakhir kya he is kishor kii dikkat?bhupinder ko janm ke saath hi daahine aankh ke paas ek tumor tha
 This tumor is sometimes due to genetic disorder, while sometimes due to unintentional reasons

 There is nowhere except for the village and the neighborhood
 
 
 bhupinder bataate hai ki unke aas-pados ke log unhen is sthiti main dekhte-dekhte aadi ho gaye hai
 People outside his village are scared to see them and say that they are melting
 isi vajah se ve apana muhalla or gaanv chhod kar kahin nahin aate-jate
 However, despite all these troubles, Bhupinder is happy and with the help of his family and friends is living life well

 During the last two days, more than two leaders of Bihar BJP have raised a melody that Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has now been in the power of the state for fifteen years, so he is now in charge of the throne of Bihar by handing over BJP leader especially Sushil Modi to Delhi

 He said, "enough Nitish Kumar

 janata dal united ke mukhya pravaktaa sanjay singh ne iske jawaab main kaha ki jab janata ne nitish kumaar ko janadesh diya hai tab is maang kii kya zarurat hai
 @nitishkumar is the Captain of NDA in Bihar & will remain its Captain in next assembly elections in 2020 also
 When Captain is hitting 4 & 6 & defeating rivals by inning where is the q of any change
 After this, senior BJP leader Dr CP Thakur said that NDA should contest the next assembly elections in the name of Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 unka kahana hai ki narendra modi kaa qad nitish kumaar se kaafii bada hai or haal ke samay main jaisi lokapriyata badi hai vaise main unke naam or chehre par ladane main zyaada faaydaa hoga
 Janta Dal United national spokesperson KC Tyagi, who came out to answer this, clearly said that even the bjp's statements should be avoided by the leaders and they make party officials but the leaders always make the public
 tyaagi ne yah tak kah diya ki bhaajapa ke netaaon ko samaj lenaa chahie ki nitish kumaar kisi ke raham-o-karam par nahin he balki janata ke janadesh par mukhyamantri bane hai, isliye pataa nahin unke haashiye par khare netaaon ke bich nitish kumaar ko lekar baicheni kyon ho jaati he
 But experts believe that even though Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi made it clear that there is no dispute about leadership in the NDA, yet leaders like Dr
 Thakur and Sanjay Paswan are making such statements
 darasal bhaajapa ke netaa apane nijee bayanon ke aad main yah tatolane kii koshish kar rahe hai ki unke bayanon kaa kya asar hota he
 At the same time, the bjp's strategy is to put forward Prime Minister Narendra Modi and bring Janata Dal United on the back foot, so that the seats do not weigh too much
 haalanki bhaajapa nitish kumaar ko lekar ek baat saaf hai ki inke saath zyaada chhedchhad naa kiya jaye to behatar hai

 kejariwal koi nai baat nahin kar rahe hai
 His gifts went to those who were to show and tell others apart
 isse aam aadmi party kii chhavi kharaab ho rahi he
 On the other hand, like the rest of the AAP leaders, Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain praised Arvind Kejriwal for prompt action when the CD case came to light
 unhone kaha hamane maamla saamne aate hi sandip kumaar ke khilaaf turant karrwai kii, jabaki baaki partiyaan koi karrwai nahin karti hai

 Out of the state congress-jds coalition government, 13 mlas have resigned, who are currently staying in a hotel in Mumbai
 inamen se 10 vidhayak congress or 3 janata dal united (jedies) ke hai
 The resignation of these mlas has increased the risk of the HD Kumaraswamy government falling
 haalanki, ab tak in vidhayakon ke istife manjuur nahin hue hai
 Assembly Speaker Ramesh Kumar said, Sunday is a holiday
 somvaar ko vah bengalooru main nahin hai
 So, we will look into this issue on Tuesday
 13 vidhayakon ke istife ke baad kya hoga or philhal vidhansabha kaa ganit kya he, aaie aapako bataate hai
 Who had how many seats in the Karnataka Legislative Assembly, in the 225-member Karnataka Assembly, there were 118 mlas in favor of the coalition government
 yah sankhya bahumat ke liye jaruri 113 se paanch zyada thi
 This includes 79 mlas of Congress (including the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly), 37 of JDS and three other mlas
 teen anya vidhayakon main ek bahujan samaaj party (basapa) se, ek karnataka pragnyavantha janata party (kepijepi) se or ek nirdaleey vidhayak he
 The opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has 105 mlas
 jedies ke 37 vidhayak hai or uske 3 vidhayakon ne istipha diya he
 Now its number of members has gone up to 34
 vahiin congress ke kul 80 vidhayak ho gaye the, jinamein se 10 ne istipha diya he (jisamen anand singh kaa istipha bhi shaamil he) to uske vidhayak 70 ho gaye hai, jisamen spikar bhi shaamil hai
 The BSP and Independents have one MLA each
 congress or jedies ke milakar ab 106 vidhayak hai, jinamein basapa or nirdaleey vidhayak bhi shaamil he
 Currently, the BSP and Independent mlas say they are with the coalition government
 224 vidhayakon (spikar ke bina) vaali karnataka vidhansabha main 13 vidhayakon ke istife ke baad sadasyon kii sankhya 211 ho gai he
 But the speaker may take time to approve his resignation
 agar spikar istipha manjuur karte hai to kumaraswami sarkaar alpamat main aa jaaegi or floor test paas nahin kar paaegi

 But according to the criteria, it should be approved as soon as possible
 uttar pradesh vidhansabha upachunaav main bijepi kii karaari haar ke baad har koi yahi sawaal puch rahaa he ki ab party netritv kya karegaa? ek suzav kendriya mantri or pilibhit se saansad menka gandhi kii ore se aayaa he
 She wants Varun Gandhi to get a bigger responsibility in UP
 ek nijee channel ne jab menka se bijepi kii haar se judaa sawaal poocha, to unhone jhat hi apane bete kaa naam aage kar diya
 At first, Maneka refused to say anything about the party's defeat
 haalanki jab unase chunaav prachaar ke dauraan bade netaaon kii anupasthiti ke bare main poocha gaya to unhone kaha ki shaayad hamen unhen (varun gandhi) waapas laana chahie
 Significantly, Maneka had last month made an appeal to make son Varun Gandhi the next Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh
 ek bhaashan main unhone kaha tha, 'agar pradesh sarkaar varun gandhi chalaa rahe hote, to pilibhit kii chaandi hi chaandi hoti
 However, the local leadership of the party shied away from Maneka's statement
 aapako bataa den ki upi main 11 vidhansabha siton ke liye hue upachunaav main samaajawaadee party ne bijepi ko karaari shikast di
 The SP won 8 seats, while the BJP had to settle for only 3 seats
 sapa ne jo 8 siten jeetin, ve isse pehle bijepi ke hi paas thim
 When Sonia Gandhi decided to become Congress President for the fourth consecutive time, the BJP said that just as she had 'sacrificed' for the post of Prime Minister, she had put someone outside the Gandhi family to that position, similarly the party's top post But they should also
 bhaajapa ke mukhya pravaktaa ravi shankar prasad ne kaha, ‘sonia chauthi baar congress adhyaksh banane ja rahi hai
 Naturally there will be no opposition to them
 congress party ke vidhaan ke anuchhed-6 ke anusaar koi bhi padaadhikari kisi blaak, jile yaa rajya ikai ke adhyaksh pad par do saal se adhik samay nahin rah saktaa
 Sonia is expected to be elected unopposed on Friday as the Congress president
 is prakaar vah sabase adhik samay tak adhyaksh pad par bane rahane vaali ban jaaengi
 Prasad said that if the Congress is a democratic party, as it claims, then it is time that it will be given to a person for two years on the post of national president, like the president of the district, block and state unit in the spirit of his own legislation
 Should not sit for more than a period
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki sonia apni party kii ‘sabase unche kad kii netaa hai’ or unki koi saarvajanik javabdehi nahin he
 Prasad said that Congress leaders always claim that Sonia has 'sacrificed' for the post of Prime Minister
 aisi sthiti main sonia ke liye yah or bhi zyada jaruri he ki vah loktantric parpanra apnaane ke apane daavon or party ke vidhaan kii bhaavana ke anuroop congress adhyaksh kaa pad gandhi parivaar se baahar ke kisi vyakti ko saunp den
 He said that the BJP believes that there are many eminent leaders outside the Gandhi family who can become Congress presidents
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki bhaajapa main padaadhikariyon ke nirvachan kii loktantric prakriya he
 Prasad said, 'I want to inform the Congress party that according to the bjp's legislation, whether at the block, district, state or national level, the chairman gets this post for only three years

 ‘piku’star ne apane prashansakon kii prarthanaaon ke liye unka aabhaar jataayaa or durghatana ke baad ke apane jivan ko ‘punarjanm’ bataaya
 Let us accept this honestly
 peshawar katleam par bharat main baari pratikriya hui he
 There is sympathy for Pakistan here, but it has a glowing gild that it has got the right lesson, something that i have already said and see that happened: Will you still keep your backyard snakes in the hope? That they will only bury your neighbors? a similar complex reaction can be expected from the relationship between the two Ranjishjada brothers of this subcontinent
 do bhaaiyon jaisaa, balki kahen ki pitrutulya bhav hamaare bheetar hota he jo apane bachche ko ulaahna detaa he or nicha dikhaanaa chahta he
 Goya, we are asking that you know me so well, we are brothers, then why don't you ever listen to me? Writer Suketu Mehta (author of Maximum City) wrote in one of his articles in Granta that our reaction is because we love each other a lot
 jaise, main tumhen chahta hum, tum mujhe chaahate ho, ham donon bhai hai, phir tum mujhase asahmat hone kii jurrat kaise kar sakate ho? yah bhaavana donon ore baraabar he or kai pakistaniyon kii us sadichha ke thik ulat, jinaki raay main hamane agar kashmir kaa masalaa hal kar liya to america-canada kii tarah shanti se yaa do bhaaiyon ke bich ke prem or jhagadon se mukt hokar ji sakate hai kyonki saanskrithik or aitihaasik rup se ham jude hue hai
 This week, some similar expressions have been seen
 katleam ke 24 ghante ke bheetar, jabaki baaki jagahon par schuli bacchon ko do minute kaa maun rakhe zyada vakt bhi nahin beetaa hoga, ham ‘saamaanya’ sthiti main lautne lage the
 In Pakistan, the blame was being laid on India as expected
 isaki kaman sir par 1 karod dollar kii vaishvik inami raashi lekar gum rahe aatanki ke haath main thi jisaki saarvajanik manch par maujuudagi bharat kii ore hameshaa uthi ungali jaisi hoti he
 No matter how low we fall, we cannot match Hafiz Saeed and Pervez Musharraf
 haa, gaali-galouj kii hode main ham jarur barabari kar sakate hai
 i have often written that our media, especially news TV channels, can no longer be liberal intermediaries on both sides of the border
 is baar phir apni usee bhoomika main ladaake ankaron ne bahes ko donon taraf ke ‘atithiyon’ ke bich bhidnt main badal diya
 Last week i also got entangled, when two anchors of Dawn TV attacked me on the phone line asking if i could ever think of defending the Indian reaction to the finger gestures of Pakistani hockey players
 phir, unhone kaha ki us din kaansya padak vaale match ke baad (australia ke saath) “aapke bhartiya khilaadi australia se ulajh rahe the
 "obviously, any Pakistani sympathy for the Australian team can be an entertaining thing for any sports enthusiast in the region, both in cricket and hockey
 maine bhi bilkul waisi hi pratikriya di jaise vaadi paksh kaa vakil palat gaye gavaah ke saath bartaav karata he or phone kaat diya
 Then what is the surprise that the families of the victims of Peshawar were not finished yet that we buried the pegs and started asking how long they would continue to feed Hafiz Saeed and Lashkar, in response to which they started to blame us and our Raw Ka began to show his hand in this attack
 ek-duusare ke khilaaf bayaanbajiyon kaa yah dhandha koi khel nahin he
 In our reaction and attitude, such old prejudices are full
 katleam kii bhayavahata dekh meri bhi fori pratikriya yahi thi ki ab shaayad nirnaayak mode aa gaya he
 Only a very suicidal terrorist group can target the children of the army of our country
 puraane dinon kaa mafia bhi pulisavaalon ko nishaanaa banane se bachataa tha or unke pariwaron ko to takreeban nahin hi choota tha
 i felt that in a moment, the attitudes of good and bad terrorists will be over
 ab yah baat nahin rah jaaegi ki hamaare (pakistan ke) pashchim ke ladaake dushman hai jabaki purab ke aatanki hamaari takat ko badhaate hai
 i felt that the eyes of the Pakistani power establishment would now open a little, perhaps to realize that all terrorists are equally bad and it is not possible that you can keep popping one while fighting the other
 lekin mahaj 24 ghante main hi mere vichaar badal gaye
 There were many talks about ending terror, it was also said that no Taliban is good or bad, but not a single sentence was said which put Lashkar in this category
 shaayad pakistan ke satta pratishthan kii hi chhot thi ki said khulkar saamne aa gaya or usne bharat ke khilaaf dhamkee de daali
 Clearly, Saeed could not do this without the exemptions of his masters
 aakhir, kisi bhi pakistani hukmran ne aisa nahin kaha kih hamaari dharti par kisi bhi gaiyr-sarkari sashastr takat ke liye koi jagah nahin he, chaahe ve taliban hon yaa lashkar, pathan hon yaa punjabi, videshi hon yaa desi
 The Taliban were blamed for all the attacks, even expressing sympathy for Afghanistan and praising the President Ashraf Ghani's promise of cooperation
 yah aise kaha ja rahaa tha ki vishwaas nahin hota ki yahi desh abhi sabase badi aatanki traasadee se guzar rahaa he jabaki kuch hafte pehle hi wagha seemaa par aisa hi hamalaa hua tha
 Despite this, the rulers there are not going to change the way they define their friends and enemies, nor will they ask Sayeed to remain silent
 isamen koi shaq nahin ki taliban ke khilaaf pakistani fouj kaa abhiyaan vaastavik he
 This is a military operation like never seen in this subcontinent
 isamen khulkar hawaii hamalon kaa istemaal kiya ja rahaa he jisamen hamalavar helicopteron kii bhi madad lee ja rahi he
 The Pakistani military does not always make public its own losses, but if you look at its military blogs and debates, you will find evidence of serious damage in which many young officers have been killed
 yah jang asli he; or fouj taliban par baari kahar barapa rahi he, isiilie taliban ne is baar uske bacchon ko shikaar banaaya he
 You can conditionally say that if there is any turning point in the path of organized armed challenge to any armed rebellion i
e
 the state
 yahaan tak ki hamaare yahaan bhi punjab main yah nirnaayak mode 1992 main aayaa tha jab sikh aatankiyon ne bade paimaane par pulisavaalon ke pariwaron kii hatya kerani shuru kar di
 Only after this did the Punjab Police decide that this war was their own and within a few months achieved what the army and paramilitary forces could not do even in a decade
 pakistani fouj ke liye peshawar main unke bacchon kii hatya aisa hi ek nirnaayak mode honi chahie
 If i feel that i am presenting the argument with some ease, then i understand that i am an advocate of peace and want to be politically correct as another Indian
 mere dost tathaa pichley 30 saal se sakriy behad samajhadaar pakistani samrik visheshgy hossain hakkaani ke liye koi aisi seemaa nahin he
 Read his article in the cover story of this issue, then you will understand why i do not want to accept the argument that this will be a turning point to change the future
 pakistani satta pratishthan raashtra-nirmaan kii islamic vichaardhaara se judaa he or ab to apni neenv rakhane vaale netaaon se bhi aage nikal chukaa he
 It has its roots in the dreaded insecurity and suspicion that appears in Pakistan
 agar pakistan ko pachaas ke dashak ke madhya ke baad se dobaaraa paribhaashit kiya jaae to use bharat ke khilaaf sthaayee vidwesh kii jagah kisi na kisi kism ke yakeen ko jagah deni hogi
 Then you compare ground realities: Look at the size of India's economy, the army, the strength and stability of its society
 ek sidhe or ranneetik faujee mastishk main yaheen aakar donon ke bich vishmata paidaa ho jaati he
 Obviously, there is no other way to fight it except to start an odd battle
 isi tareeke se bharat virdohi jehadi pakistan kii takat ko badhaate hai or uski ranneetik takat ban jate hai
 i am sorry to say that this is not going to change 
 ise palatney kaa ek hi tarika he ki pakistani janata ko yah sach swikaarne ko raji kiya jaae ki uske vajood ko bharat se paidaa jis khatre kaa naam le-lekar paala-posa gaya he, vah ek nirashaavadi or aatmghaatee myth he jiskaa uddeshy sirf uski fouj ke prabhutv ko vahaan kii satta sanrachana main kaayam rakhana he
 This ignores their economy and makes them a headache for the world
 iske badale vah sabase zyada muslim aabaadi vaala aadhunik loktantr or baaki ke islamic jagat ke liye model ban saktaa tha
 Indonesia has reached that destination long ago and now Bangladesh is running there
 pakistan khud apane hi abhishaap main fansaa hua he
 Iraq and Afghanistan were invaded and Palestinians were taken away, yet the world's most angry Muslims live in Pakistan
 yahi vajah he ki vah aaj aatankwaad kaa doosraa sabase bada shikaar bana hua he, or yah sara aatankwaad ghar main posa hua he
 American leaders are expert in making statements
 madleen albrit ne kabhi pakistan ko vaishvik sirdard qaraar dekar ise apana trademark hi bana liya tha or bill clinton ne islamabad par apni ungali phiraate hue kaha tha ki is upmahadweep kaa nakshaa ab khun se nahin ranga jayega
 The latest statement came from Hillary
 america videsh mantri ke taur par unki yah chetavanee ki aap apane pichhawaade sanpon ko is ummid main nahin paal sakate ki ve sirf aapke padosiyon ko kaatenge, peshawar kii ghatana ke baad khub doharaaya gaya
 However, there is a problem in his argument
 pakistani hukmaranon kaa pichhawada hi nahin, ek angan bhi he
 He looks across the two
 vah angan main jin sanpon ko paalataa he, ve sirf uske padosi ko hi daste hai
 The slaughter of Peshawar will not be able to overcome this deceit

 dilli main pyaaj 40 rupye kilo ho gaya he
 In a few days, the price of onion has increased from Rs 20 per kg to Rs 40 per kg, due to which people are very upset
 lekin khaas baat ye he ki jab tak nai fasal nahin aati pyaaj ke daamon main kami kii koi ummid najar nahin aa rahi he
 The reason for the sudden rise in onion prices is that the market is delaying the arrival of new crop and due to high demand in the market, onion prices are not being named
 mandi kaa sasta maal vaise bhi khudara main mahangaa hi bikta he
 In such a situation, the public will not get relief until the government intervenes in this matter

 kendriya grahamantri rajnath singh ke ghar aaj dopaher kashmir ke maamle par ucch stareey baithak kii gai
 According to sources, it was discussed in this meeting whether to end the ceasefire in Kashmir or continue it after Eid
 haalanki abhi is par antim nirnay nahin liya gaya he
 For the purpose of peace in Jammu and Kashmir, the Home Ministry had stopped the operation against terrorists till Eid
 ise ramadan sizafire kaha gaya tha
 The security of the Amarnath Yatra was also discussed in the meeting
 45 minute chali is baithak mengrih mantri rajnath singhke saath saath enese ajit dobhaal, army chif, ibi chif, siarpief ke diji, biguef ke diji jammu kashmir police ke dijipi ke alaava grih sachiv rajeev gauba sahit grih mantralay ke duusari adhikari bhi maujuud the
 Just before this meeting, BJP general secretary and in-charge of Jammu and Kashmir Ram Madhav met Home Secretary Rajiv Gaba

 In this meeting, different security agency gave a detailed account of the entire incidents of violence, along with the Home Minister Rajnath Singh, along with attacks on security forces during Ramadan
 sutron ke mutabiq 16 june ko id ke baad agar sarkaar suspension of oparation ko nahin badhaati he to vah technikali apane aap khatm ho jayega
 Let me tell you that recently, Rajnath Singh had visited Jammu and Kashmir for two days, where he took stock of the situation

 How successful, or not so successful, the ceasefire was in Ramadan? The effort by the government was not to disturb the civilians who are in trouble during the military operation against the terrorists
 isliye sizafire lagu kiya gaya
 But the terrorists had no effect on this, on the very first day of the ceasefire, the terrorists attacked the police force near the house of Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti
 iske alaava bhi puure maheene lagaataar aatankiyon ne jagah-jagah police or sena kii tukadiyon par hamale kiye

 After the Air India employee was beaten, politics has now come to a head with Air India banning Shiv Sena MP Ravindra Gaikwad and filing a case
 aaj sansad main shivasena dwaara apni maangon ko lekar is mudde par hangaamaa kiye jane ke baad bhi party aakraamak rukh apanaae hue he
 Party MP Sanjay Raut told the media on Thursday that 'the real culprit in this case is Air India, due to which it is happening and all other airline companies targeted the MP
 unhen kyon target kiya, kiske dabaav main target kiya or iske peeche koun he, uskaa bhi jaldi pardaafash ho jayega
 Sanjay Raut said that 'our MP Ravindra Gaikwad told the whole story in Lok Sabha about what happened in Air India, what happened and how it happened
 gaekwad ne jo kaha vah sachai he'
 He said, is this passenger (ravindra Gaikwad) a terrorist? Has this passenger committed a big crime? Today, many mps have cases ranging from murder to other serious crimes
 
 
 to kya sabhi ko vimaan main chadhane nahin diya jayega
 And decide who the airline companies are
 in sabhi airlines ke maalikon kii agar jaanch kii jaae to inamen ek par anderworld don daud ibrahim ke saath sidhe-sidhe santhganth karne kaa aarope he
 The party MP further said that these airline companies drove Vijay Mallya out of the country with his flight
 vah apane aap ko udakar nahin gaye naa? desh ko luutane vaale ko aap bhagaate ho
 He said that 'delhi Police is investigating this matter
 kanoon apana kaam karegaa
 So far the truth has not been revealed who did what and what they did
 ek saansad ke upar aap sidhaa bain lagaakar unhen flite main nahin chadhane denge
 This is unfair
 lagbhag 8 din se ham sarkaar, mantri ke paas or sansad main yah mudda uthaa rahe hai, lekin jab hamen laga ki yah sab karne ke baavjood bhi jab kisi dabaav main kuch nahin ho rahaa he to shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ne ek baithak main ham sabhi se kaha ki phir thik he, aap nyaay ke liye shivasena kaa akraman kar dijie
 i believe that this is an injustice and we have raised this issue in Parliament, which has hampered Parliament proceedings'
 tippaniyan He raised the question that 'your flight can fly big criminals, separatists from Kashmir who broke the country, artists coming from Pakistan, but Ravindra Gaikwad cannot fly
 
 Therefore, today we raised our voice and it was assured from the government that this entire matter will be resolved soon
 unhone chetavanee dete hue kaha ki agar 10 april tak yah maamla nahin sulajhaa to ham (shivasena) endie kii meeting main nahin jaaenge or main shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare se baat karne ke baad kah rahaa hum
 This is not the statement of the party chief
 party saansad sanjay raut ne guuruuvaar ko media se kaha ki 'is maamle main asli gunahagaar air india he, jisaki vajah se yah ho rahaa he or anya sabhi airline companiyon ne saansad ko target kiya
 Why they were targeted, under whose pressure and who is behind it, will also be exposed soon
 sanjay raut ne kaha ki 'air india main jo haadasa hua, vah kya or kaise hua, is bare main aaj hamaare saansad rabindra gaekwad ne loksabhaa main puri kahani bataai
 What Gaikwad said is true '
 unhone kaha ki kya yah yatri (rabindra gaekwad) aatankwaadi he? kya is yatri ne bahut bada gunaah kiya he? aaj bahut se saansadon par hatya se lekar anya sangeen aparaadhon main mukademe darj hai
 
 
 So won't everyone be allowed to board the plane? or yah tay karne vaali vimaan companiyaan koun hai
 If the owners of these airlines are investigated, one of them is accused of directly colluding with the underworld don Dawood Ibrahim
 party saansad ne aage kaha ki inhen airline companiyon ne vijay maalya ko apni flite se desh se bhagaaya
 He did not fly himself, did he? You drive the person who looted the country
 unka kahana tha ki 'dilli police is maamle kii jaanch kar rahi he
 The law will do its job
 ab tak sach saamne nahin aayaa ki kisne kiya or kya kiya
 You will not allow them to board a flight by placing a direct ban on an MP
 yah ninsaphi he
 For almost 8 days, we have been raising this issue with the government, the minister and in Parliament, but when we felt that despite doing all this, when nothing is happening under any pressure, Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray in a meeting Told you then that you are okay, attack the Shiv Sena for justice
 main maanata hum ki yah anyaay he or hamen sansad main yah mudda uthaaya, jisase sansad kaarywahi main baadha utpann hui'
 The comments unhone sawaal uthaate hue kaha ki 'aapaki flite se bade-bade gunahagaar, desh todane vaale kashmir ke algaavvaadi, pakistan se aane vaale kalakaar to ud sakate hai, lekin rabindra gaekwad udaan nahin bhar sakate
 
 lihaaja, aaj hamane aawaaj uthaai or sarkaar kii taraf se aashwast kiya gaya ki is puure maamle par jald hi hal nikaala jayega'
 He warned that if the matter is not resolved by April 10, we (shiv Sena) will not attend the NDA meeting and i am saying after talking to Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray
 yah meraa nahin party chif kaa hi bayaan he

 unhone chetavanee dete hue kaha ki agar 10 april tak yah maamla nahin sulajhaa to ham (shivasena) endie kii meeting main nahin jaaenge or main shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare se baat karne ke baad kah rahaa hum
 This is not the statement of the party chief
 unka kahana tha ki 'dilli police is maamle kii jaanch kar rahi he
 The law will do its job
 ab tak sach saamne nahin aayaa ki kisne kiya or kya kiya
 You will not allow them to board a flight by placing a direct ban on an MP
 yah ninsaphi he
 For almost 8 days, we have been raising this issue with the government, the minister and in Parliament, but when we felt that despite doing all this, when nothing is happening under any pressure, Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray in a meeting Told you then that you are okay, attack the Shiv Sena for justice
 main maanata hum ki yah anyaay he or hamen sansad main yah mudda uthaaya, jisase sansad kaarywahi main baadha utpann hui'
 The comments unhone sawaal uthaate hue kaha ki 'aapaki flite se bade-bade gunahagaar, desh todane vaale kashmir ke algaavvaadi, pakistan se aane vaale kalakaar to ud sakate hai, lekin rabindra gaekwad udaan nahin bhar sakate
 
 lihaaja, aaj hamane aawaaj uthaai or sarkaar kii taraf se aashwast kiya gaya ki is puure maamle par jald hi hal nikaala jayega'
 He warned that if the matter is not resolved by April 10, we (shiv Sena) will not attend the NDA meeting and i am saying after talking to Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray
 yah meraa nahin party chif kaa hi bayaan he
 He raised the question that 'your flight can fly big criminals, separatists from Kashmir who broke the country, artists coming from Pakistan, but Ravindra Gaikwad cannot fly

 narendra modi ne shapath grahan samaaroh ko desh ke naam sandesh kaa ek jariya bana diya
 He gave many messages from this
 ek compact mantrimandal banaakar unhone sabase bada sandesh yah diya ki ve bahut bade sarkari amale yaa tamzam main vishwaas nahin karte hai
 His view is simple that a big cabinet is not as effective as a group of tight and dedicated politicians
 upie sarkaar main 70 mantri the or hamane unka kaam-kaaj dekha or ab ham dekhenge 45 mantriyon ke kaam-kaaj ko
 Bureaucracy is India's biggest problem
 sachivalayon kii bhulbhulaiya main filein gum ho jaati hai yaa pratiksha suchi main rah jaati hai or kai to thande baste main daal di jaati hai
 To tighten this bureaucracy, dedicated ministers are needed, not many ministers
 narendra modi ne yah ek bada prayaas kiya he
 By giving important portfolios to his trusted colleagues, he has decided that he will not face any kind of contradiction in the coming time, that is, his colleagues will have the same opinion
 is tarah kaa talmail upie sarkaar main bahut kam dikhaa
 Narendra has given many important ministries to ministers of state for independent charge, but his intention is clear that he himself will continue to monitor the progress of his work
 inamen petroleum or gas ke alaava bijli or commers mantralay bhi he jo bahut mahatvapurn hai or zaahir he ki pradhanmantri unke progress par nazar rakhenge kyonki ye desh kii tarakkee se sidhe jude mantralay hai
 Another thing is that he took care that the very old leaders should not be in the cabinet and the younger people get proper representation
 chunaav prachaar ke dauraan rahul gandhi ko lagaataar shahzaade shabd se sambodhit karke narendra modi ne raajnneeti main vanshavaad ko puri tarah se nakaara tha
 Taking this forward, he made only two ministers in his cabinet whose family members are big figures in politics
 ye hai piyush goyal or harsimrat cor
 Piyush Goyal is the son of former minister Vedprakash Goyal but he has been involved in politics for 27 years
 isi tarah harsimrat cor punjab ke siem prakaash singh badal kii putravadhu hai or akali dal ke cote se mantri bani hai
 This is a big deal because dynasty was at its peak in the UPA government
 is shapath grahan samaaroh main narendra modi ne nawaz sharif sahit saarc ke tamaam netaaon ko bulaakar desh kii videsh niti bhi tay kar di
 It was being said by critics that if the BJP government came, it would have a malicious policy towards its neighbors especially Pakistan and Bangladesh
 lekin narendra modi ne ek jatke main yah myth tod diya
 He laid the foundation for a sound foreign policy that would have far-reaching effects
 unhone jataa diya ki unke paas moulik vichaardhaara or purvaagrah rahit soch he jis par chalakar vah desh ko antarrashtriya rangamanch par phir se sthapit kar sakate hai
 He knows that only by keeping friendly relations with neighbors, he can promote development in the country
 nawaz sharif se sidhe samvaad karke unhone dosti kii apni manshaa saaf kar di he
 Narendra Modi has given many such messages and now in the coming time we will see how he executes his election declarations
 narendra modi jaanate hai ki is sarkaar se ummiden bahut hai or isliye unhone pehle din se hi use puraa karne kii shuruuaat kar di he
 In the capital Delhi, the criminals are getting progressively stronger day by day
 haalia maamla uttar purvi dilli ke jyoti nagar ilaake kaa he
 Where fearless miscreants shot and killed a businessman outside his house
 police hatya kii vajah lutpaat ko bataa rahi he
 The deceased businessman has been identified as 44-year-old Rajul Singhal
 police ke ek varisht adhikari ne bataaya ki abhi tak kii jaanch main pataa chalaa he ki ghatana somvaar raat kii he
 Shortly before the incident, Rajul was returning home after closing his electronics showroom near the house
 isi dauraan bike par aae aropiyon ne unpar firing shuru kar di
 After firing a few rounds, the accused fled from the spot
 ghatana kii soochna milane ke baad police ne rajul ko paas ke aspatal main bhartee karaayaa
 Everyone felt that Rajul had come to heartattack
 kisi ko is baat kaa andeshaa hi nahin tha ki use goli lagi he
 Because even after the bullet on the back, there was very little blood
 der raat aspataal main ilaaj ke dauraan rajul kii maut ho gai
 Police is currently investigating the entire case
 saath hi ilaake main lage sisitivi camere kii footage ke aadhaar par aropiyon kii pahchaan karne kii koshish kii ja rahi he

 uttar pradesh main congress ke satta main aane par muslimon ko aarakshan dene kaa vaada karne par kendriya ispaat mantri benny prasad verma ko nirvachan ayog dwaara notice die jane ke baad kendriya kanoon mantri salmaan khurshid ne kaha ki sabhi mantri ayog ke disha-nirdesh ke anusaar hi bolenge
 The Commission reprimanded Khurshid for making such a promise
 khurshid ne ek samachar channel se kaha, "nirvachan ayog ne disha-nirdesh diya he
 i am sure that all ministers will follow the guidelines and speak accordingly
 " unhone haalanki yah bhi kaha, "disha-nirdesh sambhavat: or bhi spasht kiye jane kii jarurat he
 " khurshid ne kaha, "kai bindu hai, koun sa bindu kis par lagu hota he, yah samooche aadesh ko padhane ke baad hi spasht ho paaegaa
 " kanoon mantri ne kaha, "niti ke anusaar, yah spasht he ki party ke ghoshnaptr main jo kuch he, use doharaaya ja saktaa he
 "comments khurshid ne kaha, "aap ghoshnaptr kii baton se thodaa zyada yaa kam bol sakate hai
 You cannot make any announcement during the election for the first time
 " It is noteworthy that the Election Commission has sought an explanation from Verma till Monday and asked why action should not be taken against him for speaking 'knowingly' about giving reservation to Muslims
 aisa hi vaada karne par ayog ne khurshid ko fatkaar lagaai thi
 Khurshid told a news channel, "the Election Commission has given guidelines
 mujhe yakeen he ki sabhi mantri disha-nirdesh dekhenge or unke mutabik hi bolenge
 "he, however, also said," The guidelines probably need to be clarified even more
 " Khurshid said, "there are many points, which point applies to whom, it will be clear only after reading the entire order
" " The Law Minister said, "as per policy, it is clear that what is in the party's manifesto can be repeated

 aajkal baba kaa naam jubaan par aata nahin ki bas ajeeb-ajeeb tasviren jehan main kaundh jaati hai
 Now do what too
 apane baba log aisi-aisi harakatein kar rahe he ki bhakthi kii bhaavana to jagane se rahi
 That's why about a dozen Baba are on a jail visit
 ab unheen baabaaon kii jamaat main apane ye apmarket baba ne bhi apana naam judwa liya
 These most recent Baba, who is fond of bathing with girls in the sea, is accused of rape
 badal gaye he aajkal ke babage wo daur jab baabaaon kaa ek khaas huliya yaa chola hua karata tha or jinase unki pahchaan hua karti thi
 Now today's babas have been upmarket and uptodate
 satsang se uth kar baahar nikal aaen to pahchaanana mushkil he ki ye baba hai, majanuun, balaatkaari, blackmailer yaa phir saudagar?plai kii dukaan chalaata tha babaaye baba satsang karenge to sirf farm house main
 If you recite satsang, only women will fulfill their vow, but only girls, but they have the condition of getting the desired fruit, if not abroad, then roam together in the country
 apane desh ke tamaam chote-bade, achche-bure, jail ke andar-baahar vaale baabaaon kii jamaat ke ye sabase nae sabase modern, sabase apmarket baba hai
 The name of these venerable Baba is Lord Rajneesh Grover aka Ashok Plywale
 ji bhagwaan banane se pehle inaki plai kii dukaan thi dilli main
 If the Delhi shop did not work, then opened the shop of religion
 police se bhaag rahaa babine baba ne bhi wo gul khilaayaa ki inaki satsang kii jagah aaj hamen aapako khud inke bare main is vaardaat main bolnaa pad rahaa he
 After Asaram, Narayan Sai, Ichchadhari Baba, Baba with serpent dance, it is his turn now
 balaatkaar ke iljaam main jail kii hawa khaane kii
 However, Baba is currently running away leaving all the fascination and his devotees including satsang
 par kab tak bhaagenge? hai to bhagwaan hi
 Sooner or later, the police will definitely see them
 in baba kii kya tarif karen
 There was once a small shopkeeper from Delhi
 plai kii dukaane thim
 Also sold rot
 phir ek roj achaanak hi bhagwaan ban baithe
 In the name of vows, he started extracting his desire
 shauk bada tha lihaaja satsang ke liye bhi badi jagah chuni
 He would probably be the first Baba of the country to perform satsangs only in his farmhouse
 farm house main chalaaya satsang kaa dhandhadharm kii dukaan par savaar hokar samandar kii laharon par utre baba ke ye achche din haal hi main aae the
 Their condition was bad earlier
 dhandha chal nahin rahaa tha lihaaja ashok kumaar ne sochaa ki kyon naa koi or dhandha kiya jaae
 Then he felt that there is such a business of a religion in which it is possible to earn without investing capital
 phir kya tha ashok kumaar ne chhatarpur main ek farm house liya or laga lee dharm kii dukaan
 Before the inauguration of the shop, he made himself proclaim that he is the form of God and whoever he wants can not only give him the desired fruit but can also fulfill all his vow
 andhe vishwaas ke logon kii vaise bhi kami nahin he
 So the trick worked
 dekhte hi dekhte baba kaa satsang hit
 Baba used to exploit women only on Monday
 or baba ke log is baat kaa khyaal rakhte ki satsang main purush kam hi aaen to behatar he
 Baba had a special interest in women and girls
 khaas kar aisi amir mahilaayein or ladkiyaan jinke pati yaa pita naa hon yaa alag rahete hon
 Once the shop started running, Baba's devotees also became
 ab mannath puri karne ke naam par baba mahilaon or ladakiyon ke shoshan par utaaru ho gaye
 In the name of Prasad, Baba used to add intoxicants in biscuits and oranges and then play with the senses of lost women and girls
 itnaa hi nahin uski tasviren bhi utaar lete or phir use blackmel karte
 One such female devotee of Forced Baba lived in Jaipur with mother and daughter
 dukaan kaa udghaatan tha to usne baba ko jaipur bulavaa liya
 Baba stayed in his house
 magar ghar par rukne ke dauraan baba ne pehle mahila or phir baad main uski beti ke saath jabardastee kii
 Not only this, they also made a video of both of them
 phir unhen blakemen karne laga
 But the daughter showed courage and somehow she took a video or video of Baba's sea bath and went to the police from Baba's mobile and told the whole story
 isi ke baad jaipur ke jawahar cirkil thana main baba ke khilaaf rape kaa maamla darj hua
 Police suspect that Baba has targeted many more women and girls as well by blackmailing them
 philhal jaipur police baba ko dabochne ke liye dilli ravaanaa ho chuki he
 However, the news is also coming that Baba has been trying to run out of Malaysia since his own handgun broke out
