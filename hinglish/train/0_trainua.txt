 The budget which makes or disturbs the budget (spending) of the common people is now formed in the GST Council outside the Parliament
 darasal, bajet ko lekar agar kisi ko chintit hone kii jarurat he to vah swayan sansad he
 The highest institution of democracy should be deeply concerned about how India's role in determining the economic and financial policies of India is shrinking
 The government has just averted in the US
 sarkari kharch ko congress kii manjuuri na milane se puure mulk kii saans adhar main tang gai
 In both versions of democracy (parliamentary and presidential) the rules of control of the supreme institutions (parliament-assemblies) of the people's representatives are sufficiently clear on the financial and economic functioning of the government
 sarkaar ke vittiya vyavhaar par sansad-vidhansabhaon kaa niyantran do siddhanton par aadhaarit haih ek—pratinidhitiv ke bina tex nahin or doosraa—sarkaar ke batue yani kharch par janata ke numaayindon kaa niyantran
 Therefore, governments (center and state) in India cannot impose any tax nor exempt expenditure without the approval of Parliament
 bajet (rajasav va kharch) kii sansad se manjuuri—viniyog vidheyak, anudaan maangon, vitt vidheyak, consolidated fund (samekit nidhi)—ke jariye lee jaati he
 Government in India without the approval of Parliament only Rs 500 crore
 kharch kar sakati he or vah bhi aakasmikta nidhi se, jiskaa aakaar 2005 main 50 karod ru
 500 crores from Rs
 kiya gaya tha
 In the last decade, with the changing of the expenditure and revenue structure of the government, the control of Parliament and legislatures on government finances has been reduced
 jiesti sabase taaja namoona he
 Prior to GST, indirect taxes were part of the Finance Bill, after the debate in Parliament, these changes were approved
 khapat par tex kii puri prakriya, ab sansad-vidhansabhaon ke niyantran se baahar he
 After the GST Act was approved, the elected representatives of the public lost control of the indirect tax
 jiesti council sansad nahin he
 Here two dozen ministers change the tax rates every month
 in badlaavon kaa kya tark he? isse kise phayda he? jiesti council main hone vaali charchaa saarvajanik kyon nahin hoti? tex lagane ke liye pratinidhitiv kii shart jiesti council par kitni khari utarati he? jiesti ke sadanrbh main sansad or sieji kii kya bhoomika hogi? sansad or vidhansabhaon ko in sawaalon par charchaa kerani chahie
 The spending bravery of governments in India is unmatched
 karj par nirbharta badhane se byaaj bhugtan har saal nayaa record banaate hai
 The repayment of interest on debt is 18 per cent of the budget expenditure, which is not taken by Parliament's approval (charged Expenditure)
 rajya sarkaron, panchayat raaj sansthaaon or anya agenciyon ke die jane vaale anudaan bajet kharch main 28 fisadi kaa hissaa rakhte hai
 Several previous CAG reports have stated that about 20 per cent of the grants are not voted in the Parliament, that is, about 38 per cent (interest and grant) expenditure is outside the control of Parliament
 rail bajet ke aam bajet main vilay (2017) se railway kaa to koi bhala najar nahin aayaa lekin railway bajet par bhi sansad kaa sidhaa niyantran khatm ho gaya
 Rail expenses and revenue are a part of the budget like any other department
 pichley teen saal main vittiya faislon par, rajyasabha se kanni kaatane ke liye mani bill (sirf loksabhaa) kaa istemaal khub hua he
 The entire parliament is no longer involved in serious financial decisions
 udaarikaran ke baad aarthik faislon main paardarshita ke liye sansad kii bhoomika baxi chahie thi lekin
 
 
 Will the people who raise the sky with respect to Swadeshi ever want to ask what is the role of Parliament in the decisions of liberalization of foreign investment, why the Parliament never examines these decisions
 antarrashtriya nivesh, vyapaar or tex riyaayat sandhiyaan to sansad kaa munh bhi nahin dekhti
 In many countries of the world, Parliament's approval is taken on these
 jab aarthik faislon main sansad kii bhoomika kaa yah haal he to vidhansabhaon kii sthiti kya hogi? kendriya bajet ke kareeb ek-tihaai se zyada kharch ke liye jab sarkaar ko sansad se poochne kii jarurat na pade or ek tihaai rajasav jutaney ke liye tex lagane yaa badalane kaa kaam sansad ke baahar hota ho to chintaa unhen kerani chahie jo loktantr main sansad ke sarvashaktimaan hone kii kasame khate hai

 on 11 October
 haalanki,ek ore afvaah he ki rahul chunaav prachaar nahin kar sakate hai, kyonki beeti raat vah videsh ravaanaa hue hai
 BJP leader and former chairman of Haryana Housing Board Jawahar Yadav had claimed on Twitter that Rahul Gandhi left for Bangkok just 10 days before the election
 daawey ke mutabik, rahul gandhi shanivaar kii shaam bangkok ke liye ravaanaa hue hai
 However, there has been no official reaction from the Congress to the bjp's allegation
 star prachaarkon kii list main rahulhaal main rahul gandhi ne party adhyaksh kaa pad chhod diya he
 Despite this, he is included in the list of Congress's star campaigner
 party kaa maananaa he ki vah adhik se adhik matadaataaon ko apni ore khinch paaenge or congress kii vichaardhaara ko janata ke bich pahunchane main safal sabit honge
 The Congress will take up this issue, it is news that in Maharashtra and Haryana, the Congress will raise the issue of unemployment and crises
 rafel vimaanon kii kharid kaa mudda congress nahin uthaaegi
 Apart from raising the issue of economic crisis, the Congress is also planning to field former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in the election campaign to target the Modi government
 congress upaadhyaksh ke kareebi ek party netaa ne kaha he ki rahul gandhi ko loksabhaa chunaav main avaanchhneeya lakshya kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Because UPA-2 was not a good product that could be marketed to voters
 party ke bheetar hi kuch log 'team rahul' kii aalochana kar rahe hai
 He says that this team failed to live up to the expectations and it tarnished the electoral prospects of the Congress, but the party leader said that the attacks on Team Rahul were misconceptions and faulty UPA-2 government led by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh
 Estimates were based on
 naam jaahir nahin karne kii shart par is netaa ne kaha ki kai kaarnon se upie-2 sarkaar ek ke baad ek vivaadon main fansati gai
 Action taken on the lines of hatred and hatred made public among some senior cabinet ministers
 uske baad nira radia tepe saamne aae or phir 2 ji ghotaalaa
 He said that on December 9, 2009, the then Home Minister p Chidambaram announced the decision on the formation of a separate Telangana state
 ittaphacan pranab mukherjee, jo us samay varisht mantri the or jo chote rajyon par upie kii upasmiti ke adhyaksh rah chuke the, us samay dilli main nahin the, jab yah faisla liya gaya
 Denying the attack of some leaders on Gandhi's advisors, the leader said that the aim is to convert some people from key positions, so that the leaders who had gone ashore earlier can come to the decision-making positions
 unhone kaha ki lokapal mudde par bhi anna hajaare or unke samarthakon ne jis tarah abhiyaan chalaaya, maamla sarkaar ke haath se nikal gaya
 Later the issue of yoga guru Ramdev was not dealt with properly
 isi tarah lokapal vidheyak jise 2011 main pesh kiya ja saktaa tha, disambar 2013 tak lataka rahaa
 He said that it is wrong to say that Rahul Gandhi made the UPA-2 agenda
 agar aisa hota to vah press club main ek press conference ke dauraan achaanak nahin aate or daagi saansadon or vidhayakon par sarkaar ke vivaadaaspad adhyadesh ko na faadte

 Tomorrow is Holi
 ham sabhi rangon ke is tyohaar ko khub mouj masti se manaanaa chaahate hai
 Children are very excited about this festival
 bacchon kaa tyohaar to ek hafte pehle hi shuru ho jaataa he
 Children like to play in water with friends and color each other
 lekin holi ek aisa tyohaar he jisamen josh main hosh bahut jaldi kho diya jaataa he
 This causes some or the other untoward
 har saal holi par kai aisi ghatnaayen saamne aati hai jiske chalate mood kirkira ho jaataa he
 If you do not want the fun of your Holi to fade then keep these things in mind
 bacchon par nigaraanee rakhenholi ke samay apane chote bachche par nigaraanee rakhana bahut aavashyak he
 Children sometimes bow in a tank to fill water in the pitcher and fall into it
 isliye aap bacchon ko khud pichakaari main pani bhar kar den, jisase unhen khud pani ke tanks ke paas jane kii jarurat na pade
 Use Herbal Color: You cannot stop children from applying color to each other, there are dangerous chemicals in the veins of the market, so always use herbal color
 aisa karne se aapke bacchon kii skin par koi said effect bhi nahin hoga or rang aasaani se chhot bhi jaaenge
 Let me tell you, through different flowers and vegetables, you can make herbal colors yourself at home
 pichakaari kaa saavdhaanee se prayog karempichakaari vaise to ek bahut hi saral sa khilonaa he lekin usase nikalne vaala pani agar sidhe kisi ke munh par phenkaa jaae to kuch bhi ho saktaa he
 It should always be avoided
 bacchon ko samajhaayen ki aisa na karen
 If you too are playing Holi with the child then keep this in mind
 pani ke gubaare na phenkempani ke gubaare vaise to holi par bahut aam hote hai lekin iske chalate har saal kai durghatnaayen saamne aati hai
 The weight of the balloon increases greatly when it is filled with water and it can hurt when thrown at someone
 bike savaar vyakti par to gubaare kabhi mat phenkiye kyonki isse vaahan kaa niyantran bighad saktaa he
 Do not go in the mouth in any way, many children have a bad habit of putting everything in the mouth
 agar koi baccha holi kaa rang apane munh main daal letaa he to isse poijaning kaa khatra kaaphi bad jayega
 In fact, there are dangerous chemicals found in the colors of Holi, if it goes into the mouth, then it does not take long for the health to deteriorate
 puri baaju ke kapade pahanaaenbche jis josh ke saath holi khelte hai unako puri baaju ke kapade pahananaa jaruri he kyonki aisa na karne se unki skin rangon ke sidhe sanrpak main aa jaati he
 If children wear full-sleeved clothes, the side effects of the colors on their skin will be less and they will be easily missed
 duusare ke nirnay kaa sammaan karenye sach he ki ham holi par kehete hai ki ' bura naa maano holi he', lekin iskaa ye matlab bilkul nahin hota ki aap kisi ke virodh main bhi use rang lagaaein yaa holi khilne ke liye majaboor karen
 Teach your children to respect other people's decisions
 iske alaava holi khelte samay kabhi bhi mitti yaa andon kaa prayog na karen

 Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath is in trend these days

 In such a situation, Rajiv Kumar Srivastava claims that he decided to adopt this village, inspired by Deendayal Upadhyay's Antyodaya Mission and Yogi Adityanath's steps to make the people self-reliant

 If there is development in the village itself, they will stop here and work and become partners in prosperity
 dekhnaa hoga kiyogi adityanathka naam gaanv se judane se isaki takadir badalati he yaa nahin
 The reality of Purnia is that in many areas here, the light of development has not yet reached the way it should have reached

 On the fifth date of Magh Shukla, Mother Saraswati, the goddess of learning and wisdom, is worshiped, the festival of this worship is called Vasant Panchami

 vasant panchami ke din sangeet kala or aadhyatm kaa aashirwad bhi liya ja saktaa he
 If the knowledge in the horoscope is not the sum of wisdom or the hindrance of education, then it can be corrected by doing special worship on this day
 jo log mook athwa badhir hai, unke liye bhi aaj maa sharada kii upasna laabhakaari hogi
 How to worship Mother Saraswati? What to take care of? - Wear yellow or white clothes on this day, not black or red clothes - Then start the puja by facing towards east or north direction - This puja is two and a half hours after sunrise or two and a half hours after sunset Please do- Offer white sandalwood and yellow and white flowers to Maa Saraswati- Dedicate Mishri, Curd and Lava to Prasad- Seed Mantra "om Aam Namah" or "om Saraswat" Chant "namah" - Take the prasad after chanting the mantra, get the house painted in this way, people will say wow! What to do if there is a problem of concentration? - Offer white flowers to Maa Saraswati on Wednesday if you have problems of hearing or speaking- You can wear the mantra by writing the seed mantra of Maa Saraswati on a square piece of gold or brass- Seed Mant The "ey" - Do not use meat liqueur when wearing it
 Law in this country is more legal than women
 If you want success in the field of music or art - Today, you should invite saffron and write "A" on the tongue, - It is good to write to a religious person or mother
 What would be very good to do in the day normally? - Offer a pen to Maa Saraswati, and use the same pen throughout the year - yellow or white clothes Wear black, protect from black color - eat only satvik and be happy, stay healthy - Wearing topaz, and pearl on this day is extremely beneficial - Wearing a garland of rhinestones on this day, wearing it also will give the best results
 To stay, take a light and simple diet from the day of Vasant Panchami

 For many, this was a surprise when Smriti Irani was made a cabinet minister
 jabase narendra modi pradhanmantri bane hai or bijepi satta main ai he, tabhi se kai virodhabhas dekhne ko mil rahe hai, lekin is samay smriti irani kii shiksha soshal media par logon ke liye bahes kaa mudda bani hui he
 Both the opposers and those who say in favor are resorting to misdeeds in their words
 kya yah tark paryaapt he ki kuch mahaan log padhe-likhe nahin the, lekin unhone mahaan kaary kiye? or agar unhone mahaan kaary kiye, to isiilie bhale hi aap padhe-likhe nahin hai, to bhi chalegaa
 Put an end to all literacy campaigns, on this logic
 is hisaab se aap apni shiksha sambandhit halafanama kahin bhi jamaa nahin karwaaie, isaki zarurat kya he, college main admician lene ke liye bhi? lekin aisa isliye kiya jaataa he, kyonki yah ek filter kii tarah kaam karata he
 The drawback of India's education system is that you cannot judge someone's intellectual level, his understanding, his degree, his numbers
 dekhte hai, smriti irani is paddatti main kya antar laa paaengi
 Smriti Irani was never considered fit to become an MP by the public, but the Prime Minister has selected her as the Human Resource Minister of the whole of India
 lekin mujhe kahin bhi loktantr kaa, bahumat ke faisle kaa hawala dene vaale logon kii awaazen nahin sunai de raheen
 It reminds me of what my friend Nitin has said that this is a democracy, not a democracy, because we did not choose Manmohan Singh, he was chosen by Sonia Gandhi
 hamane sonia gandhi ko bhi congress kii adhyaksh ke rup main nahin chunaa tha, jo sarkaar ke faislon par muhar lagaati raheen
 The same trend continues, even in the changed government
 smriti irani ko hi kyon gheraa ja rahaa he shiksha ke masale par
 Are there no more such examples in India's politics? There are so many mps, whom the people have chosen, without looking at their level of education and even tameez
 kya iskaa kaaran yah he ki vah mahila hai? ho saktaa he isliye, kyonki unki prishthbhumi ek model kii he, or isiilie sidhe taur par mahila virdohi bayaan se bachakar yah rukh apanaaya gaya he
 In the past, Congress leader Sanjay Nirupam has made lewd remarks about Smriti Irani's background during a channel debate
 bijepi netaa subramanyam swami bhi congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi par unki degree ko lekar sawaal khadey karte rahe hai
 Even her background and what she used to do, the issue has been thrown up time and again
 lekin kya yah logon ke tarkon kaa hi masalaa he? ediaar sanstha kii website par loksabhaa chunaav 2004 ke data ko aap khangaalenge to paaenge ki smriti irani graduate hai
 He has given this affidavit
 lekin varsh 2014 ke chunaav ke halafname ke anusaar smriti irani graduate nahin hai
 He has read Bachelor of Commerce Part-1, which is not a degree and did not even need to be written there
 kya yah farjivada nahin he? kya mantri ke policy chunaav ko aap is baat kaa sangyaan lekar nahin dekhenge? There was a time when Smriti Irani was sitting on a dharna and was asking for Modi ji's resignation, but later the party woke up due to pressure
 tab tak court kaa koi faisla nahin aayaa tha
 He had taken as much footage as he wanted, but then rallied to preserve the political future
 aaj ke samay main ise 'drama' kaha jaataa he, tab ise 'dharna' kaha jaataa tha
 For the political future, you will not take cognizance of this policy election of a minister who comes under pressure from the party? middle class is mudde ko uchhaalata rahaa he ki nirakshar log, kam padhe-likhe log kyon hamaare desh ko chalaa rahe hai
 i no longer believed in the thinking of the public, because if Modi had made Sachin Tendulkar a minister, he would not have been asked about his education
 kis mantralay ke laayak hai yaa nahin, yah bhi nahin poocha jaataa
 Do not divide attitudes into the category of good and bad, because attitude is not just good or bad, it is good for someone, and bad for someone
 yah to aap dekh hi rahe honge

 BJP MP Ashwini Choubey spewed poison in nawada
before, bjp's bigwigs in Bihar, Ashwini Choubey made a very objectionable statement while attacking the Congress leadership
 navada main unhone sari hadein paar karte hue congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ko 'jehar kii pudiya' or 'putana' (rakshasi) kah daalaa or upaadhyaksh rahul ko 'videshi garbh se paidaa hua tota' kaha
 Today, india-bangladesh match in Rajkot, this match is also under the shadow of bad weather, the first T20 played between India and Bangladesh in New Delhi was in constant danger due to air pollution

 Little Master Sunil Gavaskar has said many big things about this match
 sunil gavaskar ne 'ajtak' se kaha ki pehle tii-20 match ko bhartiya team ko bhoolanaa nahin chahie
 The team should learn from this match
 mujhe lagata he ki pehle match main dot ball zyada huin thi
 This needs attention
 pehle ballebaaji karte hue bhartiya team kii ore se dot ball zyada kheli gai thim
 According to me, there were 55 balls in 120 balls which is not good
 maine dekha ki pehle match main shuruaati ballebaaj 6 overon main kuch khaas nahin kar paa rahe the
 The situation was the same with the bowlers
 hamen shuru ke 6 overon par dhyaan dene kii jarurat he
 Also, wickets will have to be drawn in the early overs
 gharelu cricket khilne se lay bani rahati haishikhar dhawan or dhoni ke gharelu cricket kam khilne par gavaskar ne kaha ki gharelu cricket khelnaa jaruri he
 This keeps the rhythm
 is toornament se pehle test match ho rahe the
 Domestic cricket was not happening much
 agar dhawan agle match main nahin khel paae to sawaal uthenge
 Rhythm is not possible because of not playing domestic cricket
 agar shikhar dhawan yaa koi bhi 25 gendon par 45 ran banaata he to chalegaa, lekin tii-20 main 40 gendon main 45 ran banane par sawaal khadey honge
 Sanju Samson may get a chance about the T20 World Cup, Gavaskar said that the Indians are in 5th position if they see the ICC rankings, which is correct
 agar rekking main 2 yaa 3 par janaa he to badi jeet darj kerani hogi
 For the T20 World Cup, Team India will have to improve their rankings and register a big win
 vahiin, sanju samson ko maukey milane par gavaskar ne kaha ki unhen westeindies tour par mauka mil saktaa he
 If Pant could not do anything or Shikhar flopped in the next two matches, then Sanju Samson could get a place in the team as a wicketkeeper

 There were reports that PM Modi and BJP chief Amit Shah supported junior telecom minister Manoj Sinha's name
 sawaal kisi dalit ke ghar nai chamakati thali main lowki kaa kofta khaane kaa nahin he
 It is not even a question that once Rahul Gandhi had eaten like this, then Prime Minister Narendra Modi had mocked the saying tourism and today when Amit Shah is eating at the house of some backward Girijabind, the Congress is making fun
 congress ko khud se ek sawaal karnaa chahie
 Has this attack of BJP left Rahul Gandhi to stay and eat in village houses? The BJP should ask itself a question, why does it want to copy a failed idea of rahul Gandhi? But this question will be asked when it is proved that Rahul Gandhi and Amit Shah have started the movement to eat dalit backward houses
 vaise bhaajapa kii taraf se media ko bheje gaye aamantran patr main girijabind ko dalit bataaya gaya he jabaki bind ati pichde hai
 Our colleague Ajay Singh from Banaras told that Bind and Rajbhar have been demanding inclusion in the Scheduled Castes for many years
 bind matsay paalan se jude hote hai or khanpan main maansaahaari hote hai
 When Dr
 Ajay Krishna Chaturvedi of Patrika
com asked the state president Maurya ji, he also admitted that Girijabind is not a Dalit
 hamaare sahyogi ajay singh ne bataaya ki girijabind pehle apana dal main the
 Then joined Samajwadi Party and now with BJP but BJP leaders say they are supporters of the party
 sahabhojita or antarjaatiy vivaah bhartiya saamaajik andolan kaa sthapit kaarykram he
 In the Indian independence movement, the influence of Dr
 Ambedkar and social reformers started increasing, then such programs started happening
 pine ke pani kaa adhikaar or mandir pravesh ke andolan kii buniyaad doctor ambedkar ne hi daali
 Later, the early socialist movements also saw a phase of breaking up Janeu and removing Singh Sharma and keeping Kumar
 in sabakaa kuch to prabhaav rahaa hoga lekin jatigat dhaanche main inase koi bahut badi daraar nahin padi
 Because the way to eat and change the name was the easiest
 darasal khaane se koi fark nahin padataa kyonki ise ek kaarykram ke tahat khaaya jaataa he
 The food of Dalits should be considered food when the people of that village started eating without Rahul Gandhi and Amit Shah
 donon kuch logon ke saath baahar se us gaanv ke ek ghar main gaye or khaae
 Did the people of the village eat their house after all this? He may not know that the younger leader of his party does this job every day
 kuch saansad or vidhayak bhi karte hai
 One has to go to the wedding procession and have to eat
 media ko jogiyapur ke savarnon se poochna chahie tha ki kya aapasi khanpan kaa silsilaa shuru hua he, kya ve bilkul nahin khate, kya ve amit shah ke jane ko baad girijabind ke ghar khaanaa pasand karenge
 But the journalist and the camera walked around the big leaders
 isamen bade netaaon kii koi galati nahin he
 a Dalit sarpanch from Gujarat has said that there is a separate cup and glass for him in the panchayat
 duusari jati ke log unamem nahin pite
 Amit Shah speaking about such untouchability in Gujarat, i really have no idea but both Rahul Gandhi and Amit Shah should also go to the villages of Gujarat and all the upper castes should line up and say that such and such Dalit Sarpanch of their home Giving water from old glass and you should drink all the water and they themselves should also drink water in front of everyone
 iske baavjood ab khanpan kaa masalaa utana bada nahin he
 People eat anywhere
 mandir pravesh or dalit ke ghar khaanaa khaanaa in donon kaa khel dekhiye
 If the priest prohibits the arrival of Dalits in the temple, the Dalits enter the temple and break this tradition
 jaise haal hi main bhaajapa saansad tarun vijay ne jokhim uthaaya
 Dalits did not refuse to feed anyone, then why is this kitchen entry movement going on in their house? These poor rites were decided by the Savarnas
 lihaaza amit shah or rahul gandhi ko yah kahana chahie ki daliton ko lekar aa rahe hai ab savarna ji apni rozmarra kii thali main (alag vaali thali nahin) pilav rasiyaav khilaaiye
 But the opposite is happening
 samarasata bhojan kaa maqasad kya he? sirf khaanaa khaanaa yaa saamaajik badlaav ke liye jokhim uthaanaa
 Those who have banned untouchability in their homes should have homogeneous food or go to the homes of those who are banned
 simpal baat he
 If the criminal is going to ban, then this tradition should be broken by going to his house
 he ki nahin
 i wonder why leaders who become social reformers in an election year do not advocate inter-caste marriages? Can they do that? What is the opinion of Rahul Gandhi, Amit Shah and Mayawati on breaking caste? Can they publicly advocate interracial marriage to end caste? Then what will happen to love jihad? Love jihad is against inter-caste marriage
 raajnneetik dalon kaa yah abhiyaan jatiyon ke bich chand masalon par vyaavhaarik talmail bithaane ke liye he yaa is shoshit saamaajik vyavastha ko samaapt karne ke liye
 Therefore, such programs have no importance
 tippaniyan Change needs to be done in politics, not on the plate
 vakt aa gaya he ki dalit raksha mantri, vitt mantri or shiksha mantri bane
 In the next expansion of the cabinet, BJP President Amit Shah should seat any Dalit MP in these positions
 samaaj kalyaan mantralay ko ghoshit aghoshit rup se dalit saansadon ke liye reserve mantralay maan liya gaya he
 It should be changed

 Why can't people like Udit Raj, who are revenue officials, become the minister of industries or the revenue minister? Now Udit Raj has left his path of Dalit struggle and has chosen the path of Hindutva of BJP, yet he is still capable

 ye donon dalit netaa angreji hindi acha bolte hai
 Why are they not assigned to the Ministry of Personnel? aise netaa hameshaa samaaj kalyaan mantri hi kyon banate hai
 Why do not such talented Dalit leaders of political parties contest on their behalf? samarasata or sahabhojita in jagahon par dikhni chahie
 The day has not yet come in the democracy of our country that any political party should put a Muslim or Dalit from the General seat
 isliye har koi sankethik sawaalon kii talash main he, kranti koi nahin karnaa chahta
 Some are making the most backward in the backward, some in the backward, making some a Dalit, and some making the Dalits a great Dalit
 vot kii raajnneeti nae sameekaran maangati he
 Does not always bring social change
 satta badal jaati he magar samaaj nahin badalata
 However, in the invitation letter sent to the media by the BJP, Girijabind has been described as Dalit while Bind is very backward
 banaras se hamaare sahyogi ajay singh ne bataaya ki bind or rajbhar kai saal se anusuchit jati main shaamil kiye jane kii maang kar rahe hai
 Binds are associated with fisheries and are carnivorous in catering
 patrika dot com ke dow ajay krishna chaturvedi ne jab pradesh adhyaksh maurya ji se poocha to unhone bhi sweekaar kiya ki girijabind dalit nahin he
 Our colleague Ajay Singh told that Girijabind was earlier in the Apna Dal
 phir samaajawaadee party se jude or ab bhaajapa se jude hai lekin bhaajapa ke netaa kehete hai ki ve party ke samarthak hai
 Cohabitation and inter-caste marriage is an established program of the Indian social movement
 bhartiya swatantraaa andolan main doctor ambedkar or samaaj sudhaarkon kaa prabhaav badhane laga to is tarah ke kaarykram hone lage
 Dr Ambedkar laid the foundation for the right to drinking water and the movement of temple entry
 baad main shuruaati samaajawaadee andolanon ne janeu todane se lekar singh sharma hataa kar kumaar rakhane kaa bhi daur dikhaa
 All these may have had some effect but there was no major rift in the caste structure
 kyonki khaane or naam badalane kaa rasta sabase aasaan tha
 Actually eating does not matter because it is eaten under a schedule
 daliton ke ghar khaanaa tab khaanaa mana jaae jab us gaanv ke log bina rahul gandhi or amit shah ke khaane lage
 Both of them along with some people went to a house in that village and ate
 kya gaanv ke logon ne unke ghar in sabake jane ke baad khaaya? unhen shaayad nahin maaloom ho ki unki party kaa chota netaa rose ye kaam karata he
 Some mps and mlas also do
 shaadi baraat main janaa padataa he or khaanaa padataa he
 The media should have asked the upper castes of Jogiyapur whether the process of mutual catering has started, do they not eat at all, would they like to eat Girijabind's house after Amit Shah's departure
 magar patrkaar or camera bade netaaon kii parikrama karke chalaa aayaa
 There is no mistake of big leaders in this
 gujarat ke ek dalit sarpanch ne kaha he ki panchayat main unke liye alag cap or glass he
 People of other caste do not drink in them
 amit shah gujarat main aisi chhooaachhut ke bare main bolte hon, mujhe vaaqai jaankaree nahin he lekin rahul gandhi or amit shah donon ko gujarat ke gaanvon main bhi janaa chahie or vahaan sabhi savarnon ko line se khadaa kar kahana chahie ki falaan dalit sarpanch apane ghar ke puraane glass se pani de rahe hai or aap sab pani pi lo or unhen khud bhi sabake saamne pani pi lenaa chahie
 Despite this, the issue of catering is not as big now
 log kahin bhi kha lete hai
 Watch these two games to enter the temple and eat food for the Dalit
 mandir main pujari daliton ke aane par roak lagaataa he to dalit mandir pravesh kar is parampara ko todate hai
 Like recently BJP MP Tarun Vijay took a risk
 daliton ne to kisi ko khilaane se manaa nahin kiya phir unke ghar main ye rasoi pravesh andolan kyon chal rahaa he? yah ghatiya sanskaar savarnon ne tay kiye the
 Therefore, Amit Shah and Rahul Gandhi should say that now the Savarnas are bringing Dalits in their daily plate (not a separate plate)
 magar ho rahaa ulta he
 What is the goal of harmony food? Just eating food or taking risks for social change
 jin logon ne apane gharon main chhooaachhut kii bandish lagaai he unke ghar samarasata bhojan hona chahie yaa jin par ye bandish lagi he unke ghar jaakar
 It is a simple matter
 apradhi agar bandish lagane vaala he to uske ghar jaakar ye parampara todani chahie
 Yes or no? mujhe hairaani hoti he ki chunavi saal main samaaj sudhaarak ban jane vaale netaa antarjaatiy vivaah kii vakaalat kyon nahin karte hai? kya ve aisa kar sakate hai? jati todane ko lekar rahul gandhi, amit shah or mayawati kii kya raay he? kya ve jati ko samaapt karne ke liye antarjaatiy vivaah kii saarvajanik vakaalat kar sakate hai? phir lav jihad kaa kya hoga? lav jihad to antarjaatiy vivaah ke kilaaf he
 This campaign of political parties is to establish practical synergy between castes on a few issues or to end this exploited social system
 isliye aise kaaryakramon kaa koi mahatv nahin he
 The comments badlaav thali main nahin raajnneeti main karne kii zarurat he
 The time has come for the Dalit to become the defense minister, finance minister and education minister
 mantrimandal ke agle vistaar main bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah ko in padon par kisi dalit saansad ko bithaana chahie
 The Ministry of Social Welfare has been declared as the Ministry of Reserve for unannounced dalit mps
 ise badalanaa chahie
 Some non-dalit ministers became there
 rajasav adhikari rahe udit raaj jaise log udyog mantri yaa rajasav mantri kyon nahin ban sakate hai? ab to udit raaj ne dalit sangharsh kaa apana rasta chhod bhaajapa ke hindutv kaa rasta chun liya he phir bhi ve qaabil to he hin
 BJP MP Arjun Meghwal elected from Bikaner reserved seat has been an IAS officer
 philippinos vishvavidhyalay se emb kiya he
 Both these Dalit leaders speak English Hindi well
 inhen kyon nahin carmik mantralay saunpa jaataa he
 Why do such leaders always become social welfare ministers
 raajnneetik dalon ke aise pratibhavan dalit netaa apni taraf se daavedaari kyon nahin karte hai? Harmony and cohabitation should be seen in these places
 hamaare desh ke loktantr main abhi wo din nahin aayaa he ki koi raajnneetik dal kisi musalmaan yaa dalit ko general seat se khadaa kar de
 So everyone is looking for indicative questions, nobody wants to do revolution
 koi pichde main ati pichhadaa bana rahaa he, koi ati pichde main kuch ko dalit bana rahaa he to koi daliton main mahadalit
 The politics of vote demands new equations
 hameshaa saamaajik badlaav nahin laati he
 Power changes but society does not change
 sahabhojita or antarjaatiy vivaah bhartiya saamaajik andolan kaa sthapit kaarykram he
 In the Indian independence movement, the influence of Dr
 Ambedkar and social reformers started increasing, then such programs started happening
 pine ke pani kaa adhikaar or mandir pravesh ke andolan kii buniyaad doctor ambedkar ne hi daali
 Later, the early socialist movements also saw a phase of breaking up Janeu and removing Singh Sharma and keeping Kumar
 in sabakaa kuch to prabhaav rahaa hoga lekin jatigat dhaanche main inase koi bahut badi daraar nahin padi
 Because the way to eat and change the name was the easiest
 darasal khaane se koi fark nahin padataa kyonki ise ek kaarykram ke tahat khaaya jaataa he
 The food of Dalits should be considered food when the people of that village started eating without Rahul Gandhi and Amit Shah
 donon kuch logon ke saath baahar se us gaanv ke ek ghar main gaye or khaae
 Did the people of the village eat their house after all this? He may not know that the younger leader of his party does this job every day
 kuch saansad or vidhayak bhi karte hai
 One has to go to the wedding procession and have to eat
 media ko jogiyapur ke savarnon se poochna chahie tha ki kya aapasi khanpan kaa silsilaa shuru hua he, kya ve bilkul nahin khate, kya ve amit shah ke jane ko baad girijabind ke ghar khaanaa pasand karenge
 But the journalist and the camera walked around the big leaders
 isamen bade netaaon kii koi galati nahin he
 a Dalit sarpanch from Gujarat has said that there is a separate cup and glass for him in the panchayat
 duusari jati ke log unamem nahin pite
 Amit Shah speaking about such untouchability in Gujarat, i really have no idea but both Rahul Gandhi and Amit Shah should also go to the villages of Gujarat and all the upper castes should line up and say that such and such Dalit Sarpanch of their home Giving water from old glass and you should drink all the water and they themselves should also drink water in front of everyone
 iske baavjood ab khanpan kaa masalaa utana bada nahin he
 People eat anywhere
 mandir pravesh or dalit ke ghar khaanaa khaanaa in donon kaa khel dekhiye
 If the priest prohibits the arrival of Dalits in the temple, the Dalits enter the temple and break this tradition
 jaise haal hi main bhaajapa saansad tarun vijay ne jokhim uthaaya
 Dalits did not refuse to feed anyone, then why is this kitchen entry movement going on in their house? These poor rites were decided by the Savarnas
 lihaaza amit shah or rahul gandhi ko yah kahana chahie ki daliton ko lekar aa rahe hai ab savarna ji apni rozmarra kii thali main (alag vaali thali nahin) pilav rasiyaav khilaaiye
 But the opposite is happening
 samarasata bhojan kaa maqasad kya he? sirf khaanaa khaanaa yaa saamaajik badlaav ke liye jokhim uthaanaa
 Those who have banned untouchability in their homes should have homogeneous food or go to the homes of those who are banned
 simpal baat he
 If the criminal is going to ban, then this tradition should be broken by going to his house
 he ki nahin
 i wonder why leaders who become social reformers in an election year do not advocate inter-caste marriages? Can they do that? What is the opinion of Rahul Gandhi, Amit Shah and Mayawati on breaking caste? Can they publicly advocate interracial marriage to end caste? Then what will happen to love jihad? Love jihad is against inter-caste marriage
 raajnneetik dalon kaa yah abhiyaan jatiyon ke bich chand masalon par vyaavhaarik talmail bithaane ke liye he yaa is shoshit saamaajik vyavastha ko samaapt karne ke liye
 Therefore, such programs have no importance
 tippaniyan Change needs to be done in politics, not on the plate
 vakt aa gaya he ki dalit raksha mantri, vitt mantri or shiksha mantri bane
 In the next expansion of the cabinet, BJP President Amit Shah should seat any Dalit MP in these positions
 samaaj kalyaan mantralay ko ghoshit aghoshit rup se dalit saansadon ke liye reserve mantralay maan liya gaya he
 It should be changed
 vahaan koi gair dalit mantri bane
 Why can't people like Udit Raj, who are revenue officials, become the minister of industries or the revenue minister? Now Udit Raj has left his path of Dalit struggle and has chosen the path of Hindutva of BJP, yet he is still capable

 The commission had declared the November 9 election date for Himachal Pradesh, but did not declare the Gujarat assembly election date
 himachal pradesh ke chunavi kaarykram kaa elaan karte vakt mukhya chunaav ayukta eke joti ne kaha tha ki gujarat ke chunaav kii taarikh bhi jald ghoshit hongi
 The questions raised on the delay in the Gujarat Assembly elections have reached the Supreme Court in Gujarat over the delay in the announcement of election dates
 congress party ne apni yachika main sawaal uthaae hai ki kyon gujarat chunaav kii adhisuchana jari nahin kii gai
 Also, there has been a demand to increase the VVPAT slip time limit from 8 seconds to 15 seconds
 apni maang ke liye mukhyamantriyon kaa aandolan nae-nae rangon main saamne aa rahaa he
 Kejriwal spent the night on the road for his demand, Kiran Reddy staged a sit-in in Delhi, now it is Nitish Kumar who started his movement in a unique way
 shanivaar kii raat nitish kumaar ne vishesh rajya ke darje ke liye pehle thali piti, phir saathiyon ke saath narebaaji kii or ab ravivaar ko paidal march kar gandhi murti par dharna bhi denge
 Hardly anyone has seen beating a Thali to a Chief Minister for his demands, but on Saturday evening, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar kept beating the Thali with his colleagues for 5 minutes continuously so that the echo of his Thali could be heard till Delhi
 chunaav kii bela main, dilli ko ye gunj bhale naa sunai de par koshish he ki unke votaron tak thali kii aawaaj jarur pahunch jaae
 By beating the plate, Nitish said that the echo of this plate will be heard till Delhi and the central government will have to listen to the demand of his special state status
 thali peetane ke baad nitish ne kaha ki iskaa uddeshy yahi he isaki gunj dilli tak jaae, har jagah se thali piti gai he to isaki gunj sunai degi or iskaa asar paidaa hona chahie
 During the Emergency, jp's followers had beaten the plate and aroused against Indira, so Nitish is adopting the same hit formula once again
 yun to vishesh rajya ke darje kii maang par andolan thodaa thanda pad chukaa tha
 But after the status given to Seemandhra, Nitish Kumar got oxygen like that
 nitish kumaar ne sawaal uthaaya, jab seemandhra ko 24 ghante main mil saktaa he to bihar ko kyon nahin
 After sloganeering, Nitish Kumar lashed out at the center
 unhone kaha, 'jab aap 24 ghante main de sakate hai, agle 24 ghante main hamen bhi de sakate hai
 You gave it to Seemandhra in 24 hours, we have no objection but we have such an old demand, then you cannot do this injustice
 kisi ko 24 ghante main dete hai, hamaari is maang ko taarkik tareeke se rakhane or lambey sangharsh ke baavjood aapane isko thande baste main daal diya
 'till now the status of the special state was seen as being associated with the electoral alliance with the Congress
 haalanki kal tak vishesh rajya kaa darja milane par congress ke saath bhi haath milaane ko taiyaar nitish kumaar ne saaf kar diya ki ab rajnatik gathbandhan ke raste band ho chuke hai, par kendra sarkaar ko vishesh rajya ke darje par unki sunani hi hogi
 On this issue, Nitish Kumar will march 4 kilometers from his bungalow on Sunday morning to Gandhi Maidan where Gandhi will sit on a dharna under the statue till evening to create an atmosphere in Bihar on the demand of his special state status
 uttar pradesh ke nikaay chunaav main bijepi ne jabardast jeet darj kii he, lekin bijepi kii jeet se zyada ye congress kii haar he, kyonki bijepi pratyaashiyon ne un ilaakon main bhi jeet darj kii he, jo congress ke garh the
 Since the victory in the civic elections, the BJP is steeped in celebrations, while the Congress is in despair
 isse bhi dilachasp baat yah he kibijapi kii jitse zyada congress kii haar ke charche hai, kyonki is baar ke nikaay chunaav main congress ke garh buree tarah dhah gaye hai
 At the same time, the BJP is claiming that after the defeat in the UP municipal elections, the Congress will also have to face defeat in Gujarat
 haalanki yah vakt hi batayega ki gujarat main congress apana paracham laharaa paaegi yaa nahin?rahul gandhi ke sansadeey kshetra amethi main bhi congress kii hayemethi nagar panchayat main bijepi pratyaashee chandramaa devi jeetin hai
 He defeated the Congress candidate by 1,035 votes
 mauka bhi he or dastur bhi he
 That is why Yogi Adityanath is taking a sarcasm on Rahul, because in the civic elections, the BJP has won the victory in every area which was the Congress stronghold
 jaais nagar palika ke adhyaksh pad par bijepi pratyaashee mahesh sonkar ne jeet darj kii he
 He defeated Congress candidate Haji Ishrat Hussain by 632 votes
 iske alaava sultanpur nagarpalika parishad main bijepi kii babitha jaiswal jeetin
 Even in the lucky draw, the Congress is saying that when there is no time, luck also does not support
 mathura ke ward number 56 par congress or bijepi ke pratyaashiyon ke bich kaante kii takkar main yahi dekhne ko mila
 Here both the candidates got equal votes
 faisla lucky drow se hua
 In this, the Congress was unlucky and BJP won
 bijepijith kaa jashn manaa rahi he, kyonki vidhansabha chunaav ke baad nikaay chunaav main congress kaa supada saaf he or is jeet ko bijepi gujarat kii lakeer maan rahi he
 He feels that a similar victory will also be found in Gujarat
 har saal ganesh chaturthi se shuru hokar 10 din tak chalane vaale ganeshotsav kii shuruyaat shri bal gangadhar tilak ne aaj se 100 se adhik varsh purv kii thi
 The main motive behind celebrating this festival was to unite the Indians against the British which is gradually being celebrated all over the nation
 ganesh pratimaa kii visarjan kathadharmik granthon ke anusaar shri veda vyas ne ganesh chaturthi se mahabharat katha shri ganesh ko lagaataar 10 din tak sunai thi jise shri ganesh ji ne aksharsh: likhaa tha
 After 10 days, when Ved Vyas ji opened his eyes, he found that after 10 days of relentless hard work, the temperature of Ganesh ji has increased a lot
 turant veda vyas ji ne ganesh ji ko nikat ke sarovar main le jaakar thande pani se snaan karaayaa tha
 Therefore, Chaturdashi is cooled by installing Ganesha
 isi katha main yah bhi varnit he ki shri ganpati ji ke sharir kaa taapmaana naa bade isliye veda vyas ji ne unke sharir par sugandhit saundhi maati kaa lep kiya
 Ganesha's body got stiff after drying this paste
 maati jharne bhi lagi
 Then took them to a cold lake and lowered them into the water
 is bich vedavyas ji ne 10 dinon tak shri ganesh ko manapsand aahaar arpit kiye tabhi se pratikatmak rup se shri ganesh pratimaa kaa sthaapan or visarjan kiya jaataa he or 10 dinon tak unhen suswaadu aahaar chadhaane kii bhi pratha he
 According to the second belief, there is recognition that during the Ganapati festival, people wish to fulfill their wish, they say in the ears of Lord Ganapati
 ganesh sthapana ke baad se 10 dinontak bhagwaan ganpati logon kii icchhaaen sun-sunakar itnaa garm ho jate hai ki chaturdashi ko behate jal main visarjeet kar unhen sheethal kiya jaataa he
 The name Morya associated with Ganapati Bappa is believed to be the Mayureshwar form of Ganapati
 ganesh-puraana ke anusaar sindhu naamak daanav ke atyaachaar se bachane ke liye devganon ne ganpati ji kaa aahvaan kiya
 To kill Sindhu, Ganesha chose Mayur as the vehicle and took the incarnation of six arms
 is avatar kii puja bhakt ganpati bappa morya ke jayakaare ke saath karte hai

 aaie jaanate hai ki notebandi par purv pradhanmantri ne kya-kya kaha
 Also, after hearing the arguments of economists on the situation arising out of demonetisation in the country, what is the common man asking? modi kii aitihaasik bhul?manmohan singh: modi sarkaar kaa aatankwaad or kaledhan kaa hawala dete hue notebandi ke kadam par sahmati nahin jataai
 Said that the implementation of the ban on demonetisation caused huge chaos
 purv pradhanmantri ne sarkaar ke is kadam ko aitihaasik bhul kii sangya di
 Said that this step could see a 2 percent drop in national income, so the Prime Minister needs to give a constructive draft
 manmohan singh ne daawa kiya ki lambey antaraal main ham gart main ja rahe hai
 Experts and the common man, there is no doubt that there is an atmosphere of chaos in the country after this decision
 global reating agency mudies kaa daawa he ki notebandi ke faisle se shuruaati dinon main jidipi par dabaav kii sthiti rahegi
 There may be a decline in the government's earnings in the first few years
 lekin mudies ne daawa kiya he ki lambey antaraal main is kadam se sarkaar ke rajasav main bada ijapha sambhav he
 Some experts are also hoping that the direct impact of increased government earnings will be seen in the pace of development in the country
 vahiin jidipi ko lekar kai arthshaastriyon kaa anumaan 3
 5 percent to 0
 3 fisadi tak giravat darj hone kaa he
 However, Moody's has denied the impact of demonetisation

 Death of common man fixed? Manmohan Singh: Today there are two opinions in the country on demonetisation
 aam aadmi ko hui dikkaton kaa khaas dhyaan rakhane kii jarurat thi
 No one knows what the impact of demonetisation will be
 modi ji ke liye 50 din kaa intjaar karnaa badi baat nahin, lekin aam aadmi se kaise 50 din intjaar karne kii baat kahi ja sakati he kyonki pehle 15 din main hi 65 se adhik logon kii maut ho chuki he
 Expert and common man is the biggest problem of the common man that in the past years he has been handing over his entire capital to the bank
 vah is ummid main tha ki use jab bhi jarurat padegi vah apana paisa nikaal sakegaa
 But the reality is saying that after the decision of the government today, the common man is unable to withdraw his money kept in the bank
 vahiin arthshaastriyon kii daleel he ki notebandi kaa yah faisla tab tak afra-tafari banaae rakhega jabtakarigerv bank paryaapt maatra main nai karency ko sancharmen nahin le aata
 This decision is directly impacting the expenses of the family and small businessmen
 abhi tak vah puri tarah se cash par nirbhar tha or aaj uske paas padaa cash bekaar kar diya gaya he or nayaa cash usatak pahunchane main vakt lag rahaa he
 Consumption in the country is entirely dependent on cash
 lihaaja aam aadmi ko digital pement kaa istemaal shuru karne or cash par nirbharta kam karne kaa kaam dhire-dhire aage badhegaa
 However, the global financial agencies are claiming that this move of the government will only provide initial hardship to the legal earning population and will benefit from it in the long run
 vahiin daleel yah he ki is kadam se gaiyrkanoonee kamai karne waalon ke liye buree khabar he
 Illegally acquired property with families may be sunk
 lekin in daavon se ulat aaj har vah aam aadmi jisane 500 or 1000 kii note main apane liye suraksha kii guarantee rakhi thi asurakshit mahasoos kar rahaa he
 Now, instead of 65 in hospitals, only 45 people have died due to currency problem, but this 45 is also the one who had the money to get treatment in 500 and 1000 currency
 3
 Death of trust on banks? Manmohan Singh: With this decision of demonetisation, people will lose faith in Indian rupee and banking system forever
 kya pradhanmantri ek bhi aise desh kaa hawala de sakate hai jahaan aadmi apana paisa to jamaa kar saktaa he lekin use nikaal nahin saktaa
 After the decision of Expert and General Adminotbandi, the flood of digital means of payment is sure to benefit banks
 ye sabhi madhyam bank kii madhyasthata main kaam karte hai
 Financial experts claim that deposits in banks will increase by 1-2% since demonetisation
 is ijaphe se bainkon ko byajdar ghataane kaa mauka mil jayega jisase unki kamai badhane ke puure asaar hai
 At the same time, some agencies like Standard & Poor (S&P) believe that this step has increased the risk of increasing npas of banks
 lekin sawaal us aadmi ke paksh ko jaanane kaa he jo abhitak bank main apana paisa isliye rakhata tha ki vah surakshit rahe
 After this move of the government, his biggest fear is that now his earnings in banks are not safe
 aaj is faisle ne aam aadmi ke man main bank ke prati ek dar paidaa kar diya he
 Most transactions (86 per cent) in the country were through cash and now the government is preferring cashless over cash
 ab aam aadmi ko nae niyamon ke mutabik khud ko taiyaar karne kii majaburi saamne he
 Even if he is illiterate, he will now have to sit in trust with the technology from which he is still untouched

 Garima Mahanmohan Singh of the Reserve Bank decreased: The move has opened the way for severe criticism which is completely justified
 vahiin bainkon ke liye nae-nae nirdeshon ko pradhanmantri karyaalay kaa hastkshep mana jayega or sawaal uski bhoomika par bhi uthegaa
 Experts and common manglobal financial institutions are believing that banks may face difficulties in recovery of their old home loans and car loans after this move
 yah badha hua enpie notebandi kii dein hogi
 The Reserve Bank will be held responsible for this NPA
 haalanki rigerv bank kaa yah kadam lambey antaraal main behatar sabit hoga
 There will be less currency communication in the economy
 zyaadaatar tranjaction virtual hoga or nakli karency par lagaam lagi rahegi
 This will make the work of the central bank easier and facilitate the domestic and foreign banks to operate in the country
 lekin aam aadmi ke liye kya rigerv bank or kya sarkaar
 The biggest question for him is that the relevance of his own bank is over and politics is happening with his financial security
 yah aanm aadmi vahi he jiske paas kaledhan kaa ek ansh bhi nahin he
 When there was more communication of black money in the economy, it was also crushing and today when it is claimed to try to end this communication, it has remained the same
 sarkaar ke is kadam par desh or duniya kaa koi arthshaastri yah guarantee nahin de rahaa he ki desh se kalaadhan khatm ho jayega or nayaa kalaadhan isaki jagah nahin le paaegaa
 His only question is whether all the black money kept in this country has come out and otherwise why is he going to have to go through this trouble? kerala aane-jane vaale rail yatriyon ko ab tikat kharid par zyada kiraaya dena hoga
 From July 1, Kerala Flood Cess of 1% will be charged on AC tickets for all trains to and from Kerala
 isi tarah se kerala main aane-jane vaali maal gadiyon main dhoe jane vaale maal par 0
 Kerala flood cess of 25 percent will be charged
 rail mantralay ne is bare main circular jari kar diya he
 According to the circular of the Railway Ministry, one percent of AC tickets for Kerala will not be refunded in case of cancellation of Kerala Flood Cess tickets
 kerala flud ses (keeffsi) tikat par alag se print kiya jayega
 Railways have also given examples to explain the way KFC is collected

 Both Nirerenu Kushwaha and Vijay Kumar Singh are in the BJP when it came to the conference
 yahaan tak to thik he lekin najaara tab dilachasp ho gaya janata darbar ke dauransusheel modi nesamvaadadaataaon ko sambodhit karnaa shuru kiya
 For about 30 minutes, Sushil Kumar Modi held a press conference and kept answering the questions of journalists and during this, Renu Kushwaha and her husband Vijay Kumar Singh slept fiercely
 pehle soe vijay kumaar singhcmare main jo tasviren kaid hui hai usase saaf he ki vijay kumaar singh ne to neend ke saamne ghutane pehle hi tech die magar unki mantri rahi patni neend ke saath do-do haath karte hue najar ai
 Sushil Kumar Modi kept speaking and Renu Kushwaha kept sleeping, sometimes she yawned
 nitish sarkaar main mantri thim renu kushvahagauratlab he ki renu kushvaha 2010 main janata dal united se vidhayak chuni gai thi, jiske baadanitish kumarasarkaar main unako udyog evam aapadaa prabandhan mantri banaaya gaya tha
 Renu Kushwaha's husband Vijay Kumar Singh joined the BJP during the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, due to which Renu Kushwaha also had to leave Janata Dal United and join BJP
 2015 ke vidhansabha chunaav main renu kushvaha bhaajapa ke tikat par samastipur sechunaavhaar chuki hai
 Vijay Kumar Singh has also contested the 2014 Lok Sabha elections from Madhepura on a BJP ticket and lost

 The Chief Electoral Officer of Madhya Pradesh has issued an order banning the broadcast of the Congress by canceling the 'chowkidar Chor Hai' advertisement of the Congress
 sanyukt mukhya nirvachan padaadhikari rajesh kaul dwaara rajya ke sabhi jiladhikariyon se buudhvaar ko ek aadesh jari kar kaha gaya he ki, loksabhaa chunaav ke liye bhartiya rashtriya congress dwaara prasaarit kiye ja rahe vigyaapan 'chaukeedaar chor he' ko rajya media pramann tathaa anuvikshan samiti dwaara nirast kiya gaya he
 Therefore, its broadcast should be banned
 pehle bhi supreme court ne bhi 'chaukeedaar chor he' vigyaapan par rahul gandhi se jawaab talab kiya tha
 It may be noted that an appeal was made in the office of the Chief Electoral Officer on behalf of Bharatiya Janata Party MP Meenakshi Lekhi, objecting to the Congress 'chowkidar Chor Hai' advertisement
 is shikaayat main kaha gaya tha ki yah vigyaapan apmanjanak, badnaam karne vaala or aapattijanak he
 It is broadcasting without any permission from the Media Certification and Monitoring Committee of experts constituted by the Election Commission of India

 saath hi congress se kaha gaya he ki vah is vigyaapan ko kisi bhi madhyam se prasaarit na karaae or in vigyapanon kii prati karyaalay main jamaa karaaen

 According to reports, Deepika Padukone's character in the film will be titled Malati

 With the results of Gorakhpur and Phulpur by-elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party is in a hurry
 mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne nateezon ke baad iskaa kaaran atiaatmavishvaas bataaya tha
 However, now they will have to get Amit Shah aware of this drastic defeat
 sutron se khabar he ki bijepi alaakaman ne mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ko dilli bulaayaa he
 BJP president Amit Shah is expected to meet him on Saturday evening
 is baithak main gorakhpur or phulpur upachunaav ke vipareet nateezon par bhi charchaa ho sakati he
 This meeting will be held between Amit Shah and Yogi Adityanath at 5 pm on Saturday evening
 vahiin aapako bataa den ki isse pehle yogi adityanath ne haar ke baad apane kai kaarykram radd kar die the
 The UP CM canceled all his political programs to be held on Thursday
 purv main tay kaarykram ke mutabik yogi adityanath ko gonda janaa tha, vahaan par yogi ko 4 divasiy lok kala mahotsav main hissaa lenaa tha
 But now he will be replaced by Deputy Chief Minister Dinesh Sharma at the festival
 kaarykram main yogi ko nanaaji deshmukh kii murti kaa anaavaran karnaa tha
 Let us tell you that in the results of the by-elections in gorakhpur-phulpur Lok Sabha seats on Wednesday, the candidates of the Bharatiya Janata Party have been defeated badly
 gorakhpur upi siem yogi adityanath or phulpur dipti siem keshav prasad maury kii seat thi
 Let me tell you that till now Gorakhpur seat of Purvanchal has been considered as the strongest fort of BJP, but in the by-election this safe fort has been broken
 pichley 30 saal se bijepi ke liye ajey rahe gorakhpur loksabhaa seat par hue upachunaav main basapa ke samarthan se sapa ne jeet kaa paracham laharaa diya he
 The BJP candidate not only lost from the Gorakhpur parliamentary seat, but the Gorakhnath monastery of which Yogi Adityanath Mahant is, also got less than 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 gorakhnath math vaale booth (booth sankhya 250) par bijepi ummidavaar upendra shukla ko mahaj 182 vot mili
 While Yogi Adityanath got 233 votes in the 2014 election
 haalanki yogi or gorakhpur kii siyasat kaa sabase bada centre gorakhnath math pichley teen dashak se he
 At the same time, Yogi Adityanath had said on the defeat that we failed to understand this (BSP-SP) alliance, which is also a reason for overconfidence
 donon chunaav hamaare liye ek sabak he, isaki samiksha kii kaaphi jarurat he
 Yogi said that he accepts this decision
 upi siem bole ki antim samay main sapa-basapa ek saath ai, donon partiyaan rajyasabha chunaavon kii vajah se ek saath ai
 We failed to understand this alliance, one of the reasons for this is overconfidence
 unhone kaha, 'ham apni kamiyon ko dur karne kii puri koshish karenge, ham bhavishya kii behatar yojana par kaam karenge
 He told the media and the public the reason for the defeat, but at the same time it remains to be seen what he tells Amit Shah the reason for the defeat
 ' Yuvraj Singh, the hero of the victory in the first match of the T20 series after the defeat in Test cricket, said that he hoped that his team would follow this rhythm not only in the second T20 match against England but in the upcoming series against Pakistan
 Will also continue
 bharat ko pune main paanch wicket se mili jeet ke baad yuvaraj ne kaha, tii-20 or van-de cricket main hamane unke khilaaf acha pradarshan kiya he
 Hopefully, this rhythm will be maintained, as there is an important series to play against Pakistan ahead
 yuvaraj ne harfanmaulaa kii bhoomika bakhubi nibhaate hue 19 ran dekar teen wicket liye
 After this, he scored 38 runs in 21 balls with the help of three sixes and two fours
 bharat or pakistan ke bich do tii-20 match 25 or 28 disambar ko kramash: bengalooru or ahmedabad main khele jaaenge
 After this, there will be a series of three odis from 30 December to 6 January
 iske baad bharat 11 se 27 janvari tak england se best of five van-de shrunkhlaa khelegaa
 Yuvraj said it was disappointing to lose the series last year to England and then 2-1 here
 england ne acchhee cricket kheli lekin hamane unhen pichley saal vanade main 5-0 se haraaya tha
 He said that the fielding of the team has improved due to the presence of young players
 yuvaraj ne kaha, pehla match jitkar acchhee shuruyaat jaruri he
 Fielding of the team has improved a lot due to the arrival of youngsters and this win will boost confidence
 tii-20 or vanade cricket vaale form ko test main nahin dikhaa sake yuvaraj ne kaha ki chote praaroop main unhen khulkar khilne kaa mauka miltaa he
 He said, i play openly in T20
 mujhe apni ballebaaji main majaa aata he or gendbaaji bhi prabhavi rahati he
 The champion cricketer, who returned to the field after recovering from cancer, said that the spinners did not let England get off to a good start in the first T20
 tippaniyan He said, when the openers play fast, there is a worry
 ham 180-190 ran bhi bana lete lekin hamaare spinneron ne behtareen pradarshan karke unhen vahaan tak pahunchane hi nahin diya
 Yuvraj said that the youth will have to give more space in the team to take the Indian team forward
 unhone kaha, yuvaaon kaa team main aana acchhee baat he
 We have great players like Parvinder Awana and Bhuvneshwar Kumar
 raina, kohli or rohit team ke sadsy hai or main senior ho gaya hum
 Giving youngsters a chance is a good thing for the team

 The question is also why the knowledgeable medical team and doctors were not sent at altitudes of 9,000 to 12,000 feet

 The Congress, which is trying to oust the Bharatiya Janata Party from power in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections by bringing together non-bjp parties across the country, now appears ready to unite in Delhi as well
 congress kii varisht netaa or dilli kii purv mukhyamantri shila dikshit ne aam aadmi party se gathbandhan ke sawaal par kaha he ki agar party haikaman aisa koi faisla karata he to vah ise sweekaar karenge
 Sheila Dikshit's statement to the news agency ANI is considered to be very important, because till now Ajay Maken, who has commanded the Delhi Pradesh Congress, has been dismissive of the questions and prospects of the alliance with AAP
 ajtak se shila dikshit kii baatcheetpurv siem shila dikshit ne ajtak se exclusive baatcheet main kaha ki jab gathbandhan hoga tab uske koi kaaran honge, uski koi vajah hogi, us par main abhi koi tippanee nahin karnaa chaahati
 He said that preparations are made under the requirements which are being done by the same party
 purv siem ne aage ye bhi kaha ki gathbandhan ke liye naa mujhe kisi ne poocha he or naa mujhe is bare main maaloom he
 But if you ask my opinion, it is the Congress that can do everything by itself
 'main nahin, haikaman tay karegaa'gathbandhan hoga to kya swaroop hoga is sawaal par shila dikshit ne kaha, 'abhi gathbandhan nahin hua to kaise bataa duun, jab hoga tab tay hoga ki koun kahaan ladega, kaise ladega, koun si seat koun ladega
 Can't answer right now, the party will decide, the high command will decide
 'unhone ye bhi kaha ki upi kii paristhiti alag he or yahaan kii alag he
 Talk of coalition is going on all over the country, so what to say until it happens now
 purv siem ne ye bhi kaha ki kaaryakarta or aam netaa gathbandhan tay nahin kar rahe he, ye faisla haikaman karegaa
 However, he definitely said that the alliance is definitely discussed but it has not happened yet
 rahul gandhi par badi shraddhashila dikshit ne rahul gandhi par kaha ki wo puri tarah taiyaar hai or agar taiyaar nahin hote to haal ke chunaav nahin jite hote

 At the same time, he also said that no decision has been taken on my contesting elections and nothing is difficult for me, i will do whatever the party decides
 bataa den ki aam aadmi party kii raajnneeti kaa aagaaj congress ke bhrashtachar par prahaar se hi shuru hua tha
 Both parties are considered anti-delhi in terms of Delhi's politics

 GST gives increased confidence in business and customers: mangalvaar shaam ko main aam aadmi party ke siem ummidavaar arvind kejariwal kii ek jansabha cover karne ke liye patpadganj vidhansabha kshetra main gaya
 The last time aap's elder leader Manish Sisodia won the election from here and this time also he is in the election field from here
 lekin is jansabha main arvind kejariwal or manish sisodiya tay vakt se let pahunche or unke aane ke baad vahaan par kuch avyavashtha dikhi
 Actually it was chaos that caused the mob's management and i was feeling that at any moment the tents might fall and a stampede could happen
 lekin phir maine chaaron taraf ghumaai or mahasoos kiya ki asal main ho kya rahaa he
 
 
 This situation came for the first time in Kejriwal's public meeting, it was difficult to control the crowd
 khayr kisi tarah sabakuch thikthak nipat gaya lekin phir mere man main jo baat ai vah main bataane ke liye yah sab likh rahaa hum
 Although i have already covered many public meetings of the Aam Aadmi Party, but this time i have been covering the public meeting of Kejriwal since December
 kisi ek jansabha ko dekhakar yaa usamen maujuud janata kii sankhya ko dekhakar main koi dharna nahin bananaa chahta or naa kuch maanakar baith janaa chahta hum, lekin do maheene main kejariwal kaa prachaar cover karne ke baad jo lag rahaa he vah bataa rahaa hum
 The crowd in Kejriwal's public meeting is not only constantly standing, but it is seen increasing
 keval loar class ilaake main hi nahin, balki middle or apper middle class ilaake main bhi sankhya acchhee khaasi dikh rahi he
 But when the public meeting takes place in the countryside and lower class areas, the number increases a lot
 khaas baat yah bhi he ki bheed keval sunati hi nahin, balki kejariwal ke bolne par bich-bich main naare lagaati he
 a large number of such people are seen who come only to see Kejriwal, which reflects the popularity of Kejriwal on the ground
 ek udhaaharan dekar baat karata hum
 It was last Friday 23 January
 chhatarpur vidhansabha ke andar mujhe bhaati mins ilaake main arvind kejariwal kii jansabha cover karne ke liye bheja gaya
 i arrived a little earlier than scheduled
 maine vahaan jaakar jo dekha usko dekhakar mujhe aayojakon or party ke logon se phone karke ye poochne kii zarurat pad gai ki kya vaaki jansabha ho rahi he yaa hogi? mujhe jawaab mila ki hogi hi
 i went into deep thinking
 asal main vahaan sara keechad hi keechad tha, kyonki usase pehle din vahaan khub barish hui thi or maine aasmaan dekha to lag rahaa tha ki badal ab bas kabhi bhi baras sakate hai
 Arrangements for the meeting could not be made there and i was afraid that my coming so far might not be in vain, because when we have come, at least see something
 aise hi aakar aise hi chale to samay kaa itnaa nuksaan bahut dukhega dil ko
 Well then i thought it would be okay that would happen
 lekin mere dekhte hi dekhte vahaan par saare intazaam ho gaye or ek samay jahaan par sabha hona bhi mushkil lag rahaa tha, sabha bhi hui or tasviren dekhie or andaaza laga lijie
 
 
 
 
 (there was so much mud that today, even while writing this, that mud was not completely gone from my shoes) lekin kya in tasveeron se yaa phir lagaataar jansabhaon main badhati bheed se ye sidhaa maan lenaa chahie ki aam aadmi party chunaav jeet hi jaaegi? i remember that during the Lok Sabha elections, there used to be a lot of crowd to listen to Kejriwal, especially in Delhi meetings
 loksabhaa chunaav main party ko vidhansabha chunaav se zyaada vot mili lekin party bijepi ke mukaable dilli main sabhi siton par duusare number rahi
 But then at the same time, during the Lok Sabha elections, the crowd of PM Modi's rally is missed
 bheed bhi hui or 30 saal baad pehali baar kisi ek party ne apane dam par bahumat paa liya
 This means that winning the election cannot be considered as a direct meaning of the crowd, but yes there is a rough sense of the atmosphere
 aaj dilli main yah baat har koi kah rahaa he ki bijepi or aam aadmi party main kaante kii ladaai he, lekin kuch maheenon pehle har koi ye kah rahaa tha ki kal chunaav ho jaaen, to 70 siton kii vidhansabha main bijepi 50-60 siten le aegi yani yah baat saaf he ki dharna main or jansabha main bheed se ye trade dikh rahaa he ki lagaataar aam aadmi party aage badhati ja rahi he
 Not only this, the Aam Aadmi Party is still ahead of the BJP in the ground level campaign, while the days of counting are now left for the election
 yah ehsaas shaayad ab bijepi ko bhi he, isliye agle kuch dinon main bijepi puraa mantrimandal dilli main utaarne ja rahi he
 The Prime Minister will hold four rallies, 13 ministers will see different legislatures, 70 mps will hold different responsibilities, campaigners will come from the Union and ministers will come from Madhya Pradesh
 jaahir he, kejariwal kii behad majboot hoti chunauti bijepi ko daraa rahi he

 Rahul tweeted- "prime Minister, i laid the foundation of Amethi's Ordinance Factory in 2010 itself
 pichley kai saalon se vahaan chote hathiyaaron kaa utpaadan chal rahaa he
 Yesterday you went to Amethi and forced by your habit, you lied again

 com / idzyz6ks2o — Smriti z Irani (@smritiirani) March 4, 2019 India Today anti-fake News War Room (AFWA) found that Rahul Gandhi's claim is false
 rahul gandhi ne 2010 main nahin balki 2007 main korwa sthit is hathiyaar kaarkaane kaa shilanyas kiya tha
 Production was started long after the foundation stone
 piem modi ne bhi is baat kaa zikr apane bhaashan main kiya tha
 The PM said in the speech- “amethi MP laid the foundation of this factory in 2007
 us samay yah kaha gaya tha ki factory main nirmaan 2010 tak shuru ho jayega
 But friends, even after three years of foundation stone, the government could not decide what kind of weapons would be manufactured here, where this factory would be made
 yahaan tak ki is pariyojna ke liye jameen bhi uplabdh nahin karai gai thi
 Friends, the factory in which construction should have started in 2010, the building of that factory was hanging until 2013
 building banane ke baad kisi tarah yahaan nirmaan shuru hua lekin phir bhi, aadhunik riflon kaa utpaadan shuru nahin hua
 "this excerpt of the Prime Minister's speech can be heard in the video after 21 minutes

 is baat kaa zikr indian ordinance factory sanghathan ke 2007 kii ek patrikamein bhi kiya gaya he

 CAG ne sarkaar kii aalochana karte hue kaha tha ki factory ke liye chuni gai jameen anuchit he or ho saktaa he isko puraa hone main bahut samay lag jaae
 The Times of India also published the news in August 2010 on this CAG report
 raksha mantralay ne 2007 main korwa ordinance factory ko sweekruti de di thi
 It was to be built at a cost of Rs 408 crore and it was to produce 45000 carbines annually
 shuruyaat main is project ko puraa karne kii ded line oktober 2010 tay kii gai thi, haalanki baad main ise badal kar march 2017 kar diya gaya tha
 a CAG report released in 2017 confirms this
 aisa kaha gaya thaki march 2016 tak is pariyojna par 276 karod rupye kharch kiye ja chuke the, lekin iskaa ordinance board ko koi phayda nahin ho paaya tha
 Inaugurating the AK 203 unit on Sunday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in his speech that despite being the foundation stone in 2007, the factory could not start production of modern rifles for so many years
