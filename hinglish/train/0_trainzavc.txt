 Sharad Pawar, the vicious architect of Maharashtra's coalition government, has set a new agenda for the opposition - open up the bjp's double standards, don't let the Prime Minister have the opportunity to live on moral heights, and be aggressive round the clock
 so ab, BJP or unke mukhya sanchaalkon - pradhanmantri narendra modi or grahamantri amit shah - ko chintit hona chahie
 Sharad Pawar is one of the most vicious and clever politicians in our country, and speaks every word very carefully
 modi kii ore se 'milakar kaam karne' ke liye kathith rup se pichley maah kii gai peshkash ko lekar saarvajanik rup se TV intervyuu main unka bolnaa sochi-samajhi ranneeti thi
 In an interview given to abp-majha, Sharad Pawar had said that Modi had also offered his daughter Supriya Sule a place in the central government, provided she joined the BJP to form the government in Maharashtra
 sharad pavaar ko yah 'abhadra peshkash' unki or unki party rashtravaadi congress party (NCP) kii saarvajanik rup se sansad main tarifon ke pul baandhne ke baad kii gai thi
 According to Pawar, he said, "thank you, but don't want to
" 
 
 " yah kathith peshkash 20 november ko modi or pavaar ke bich hui mulaakaat main kii gai thi, jab BJP or unke pratidwandviyon ke bich maharashtra main sarkaar gathan ko lekar rassakashi jari thi, or gathan sirf isliye atka hua tha, kyonki bjp-virdohi partiyon ke bich avishvaas tha or unki vichaardhaaraein bhi ek duusare se katai vipareet thim
 Pawar's public offer to highlight the bjp's claim of power in Maharashtra was made public when Prime Minister's critics criticized him for his image and credibility in the early hours of lifting President's rule to allow Devendra Fadnavis to become the Chief Minister
 Allegations of compromise
 rajya main chunaav prachaar ke dauraan modi NCP ko lagaataar 'nechurali karpt party' kehete rahe the
 His party's 72-hour alliance with Sharad Pawar's nephew Ajit Pawar broke down when Sharad Pawar took his nephew back to his court, and then the Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress alliance led Uddhav Thackeray to the forefront Taking over power of Maharashtra
 ab tak modi khud ko bhrashtachar-virdohi andolankaaree ke rup main safaltaapurvak pesh karte rahe hai, jo kahata he - 'na khaauungaa, na khaane duungaa
 
 
 The aftermath of Maharashtra's 'misadventure', a period of ongoing criticism for the BJP, was fueled by Pawar's claim, which pierced Modi's public claims, and completely exposed the bjp's claim to power
 sharad pavaar ne sunishchit kar diya ki modi or BJP ab naitikta kii oonchaaiyon par rahane kaa daawa na kar paaen
 But by bringing Modi's offer to the public, Pawar also ended his chances of joining with him
 yah kuch alag tha, kyonki pavaar isi baat ke liye jane jate he ki unke dost har kheme main hai
 Modi is known for his strong memory and not forgetting complaints
 pavaar dwaara saamne laae gaye is kisse main modi dohare maandand rakhane vaale aise shaks ke rup main saamne aae, jiskaa koi usul nahin he, or jise pavaar katai bardaasht nahin karenge
 Then why did Pawar take this threat, while he could get a chance to target his rivals in many strict ways, including the use of investigative agencies, due to his proximity to the central government
 
 
 ? vah maharashtra main apane gathbandhan sahyogiyon - uddhav thakare or congress - ko yah sanket dena chaahate the ki vah nishchit rup se milakar chalane vaale saathi hai, or badalte mausam ke saath nishtha badalane vaale shaks ke taur par unki chhavi sach nahin he
 Pawar, who has the image of an unstable ally, has tried to reassure Uddhav Thackeray that he is determined to sustain the partnership in Maharashtra for a long time, and is not looking for any other alternative
 congress pramukh sonia gandhi ke salaahkaaron ne bhi unhen kaaphi samay tak yahi samajhane kii koshish kii thi ki pavaar par bharosa nahin kiya janaa chahie
 Pawar went public and forced him to remain silent
 congress ke sutron ke anusaar, vyaavhaarik raajnneeti karne vaali sonia gandhi maharashtra main sarkaar gathan ke khel main puri tarah pavaar ke mutabik chalin, or ab lagata he, unki sarkaar ke gathan ke baad pavaar kii har baat sach sabit ho gai
 a senior Congress leader told me, "the condition of the Congress and the Opposition is that Sonia Gandhi has publicly returned to the Congress party's umbrella from leaders such as Pawar and Mamta Banerjee (chief Minister of West Bengal) She says
 
 
 vaise, jadon se jude hue kshetreey netaaon ko waapas laana hi ekmaatr tarika he, jisase vipaksh modi kii BJP ko chunauti de sakegaa
 
 
 But the Congress is unfortunate that Rahul Gandhi is strongly against any such move
 
 
 "mukhyamantri ke rup main padbhaar sanbhaalane ke baad uddhav thakare ne samay ganvaae bina purvavarti devendra fadanvis ke bade faislon ko palat diya, jinamein vivaadaaspad car shed project (mumbai metro project kaa hissaa) bhi shaamil he, jiske liye hazaron kii taadaad main pedo ko kaata gaya, or yah bhi saaf kar diya ki vah mumbai se ahmedabad ke bich bullate train chalaane ke modi ke dream project ko bhi radd kar sakate hai
 By the way, Pawar has not just targeted Modi
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki vah jaj bi
 H
 loya kii achaanak hui maut kii nae sire se jaanch chaahate hai, jo soharabuddin shaikh muthbhed kii sunwaayee kar rahe the, jisamen amit shah bhi aaropee the (unhen us jaj ne discharge kar diya tha, jo jaj loya ke sthaan par niyukt hue the)
 Pawar's demand for fresh investigation is clearly a move against Shah
 NCP ke varisht netaaon kaa kahana he ki shah or BJP ko chetavanee he ki maharashtra sarkaar ko asthir nahin kiya janaa chahie
 With the success achieved in Maharashtra, Pawar is now emerging as a possible basis for opposition unity
 12 disambar ko sharad pavaar 80 varsh ke ho jaaenge, or uskaa jashn vipakshi shakti ke naam hoga
 Work has been fixed for Sharad Pawar

 The Bombay High Court has said that if Govinda is arrested, immediate bail will be accepted on the basis of his personal bond of Rs 25,000 and one surety
 govinda ne 20 saal puraane maamle main agrim jamaanat ke liye bombai hoicourt kaa darwaja khatkhataya tha

 Pakud used to be in Bihar at the time this case was filed
 nayaa rajya jharkhand banane ke baad pakur usamen aa gaya
 Govinda said in his application that he only acted in the film and he did not write that song
 govinda ne ye bhi kaha ki gane ke bol naa to ashleel hai or naa hi kisi kii manahani karne vaale
 There was no intention of defaming any community, caste, region, class or society regarding singing
 bataa den ki pakur kii magistrate court ne geetkaar, sangeetkaar ke alaava parshvagayakon udit narayan or alka yaajik ko bhi 6 march ko pesh hone ke liye kaha he
 After getting relief from the Bombay High Court, Govinda no longer needs to appear in the court in Pakud on 6 March
 govinda ke vakil ne bombai hoicourt ko bataaya ki unke muvakkil ko ye jaankaree tak nahin thi ki jharkhand main kya ho rahaa he
 When the Jharkhand Police reached Govinda's house on 27 February, they came to know about it

 Islamic expert Akhtarul Vase says, 'every issue and subject affecting the country has an equal impact on the Muslim society
 meraa maananaa he ki yah saal kul milakar desh ke liye acha rahaa he or aise main muslim samaaj ke liye bhi acha tha
 There was no significant result on reservation or some issues, but in democracy, hope should always be kept
 ’ saal 2012 kii shuruyaat main obisi cote main alpsankhyakon ke liye saadhe chaar fisadi aarakshan kaa praavdhaan karne sambandhi centre sarkaar ke faisle ko lekar khub bahes hui
 The decision of the Center, which came before the assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh and some other states, was seen as an attempt to gain political advantage
 yah baat digar he ki iskaa uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaav main congress ko koi phayda nahin hua
 When the BJP strongly opposed the reservation, the SP and BSP called it a sham
 isi bich may main andhra pradesh ucchnyaayalay ne saadhe chaar fisadi aarakshan ko radd kar diya
 Now the central government is saying that it will put its side in the Supreme Court broadly

 Since 2000, the statue was present at the Ort Gallery of South Australia (AGSA) in Adelaide
 bhagwaan nataraj kii panchalok murti ko 1982 main thirunelaveli jile ke kalidaikurichi se churaayaa gaya tha

 But the Aam Aadmi Party is not ready to back down from this
 3
 Rhetoric in public: The Congress also has reservations about the fact that Arvind Kejriwal is continuously making statements in the media about the alliance

 But the discussion of the film increased from last few days when posters of Kareena and Arjun kissing came out

" vah bhi kuch behtareen kaam kar rahe hai
 " jab film 'kii and kaa' kaa pehla trailor jari karne film kii team ai tab sabase pehle is chumban vaale poster ke bare main sawaal puche gaye
 Kareena also seems to be in a good mood, so Kareena accused the film director r Balki of breaking the house and said, "balki sir, i think you will get me divorced
" " Since the theme of the film is on Working Women, whose husband handles the house, the question was also asked who wears flower pants? Kareena said "what do you think? Saif looks very good in jeans
 karina ne aage kaha ki "main shaadishuda hum or kaam karti hum or yah bahut kuch kahata he hamaare or saf ke rishton ke bare main
 He is also doing some great work

After the latest Maoist attack, a wave of thoughts and thoughts are on the rise once again within the country
 desh kii aantarik suraksha ke liye sabase bada khatra kahe jane vaale naksalwad ne ek baar phir sir uthaaya he
 Like every time, this time, apart from 'crushing' the Maoists, there is talk of deploying more security forces and getting the help of army from 'outside', but in this inter-war between India, many untold and unresolved Stories are being written every day, which are neither reporting nor they excite us as much as we are all seeing
 chhattisgarh ke bastar kaa kareeb ek lakh varg kilometre kaa ilaaka pichley paanch saalon se is ghamaasan kii chapet main he
 With the commencement of Operation Green Hunt, in November 2009, i went to the camp of Maoists and talked to one of their top leaders, Kadarya Satyanna Reddy aka Kosa
 kosa ne intervyuu khatm hone ke baad kaha ki bharat sarkaar ne is ladaai main ek badi galati kii he
 When i asked about this mistake, Kosa said that the details given by the government before starting the operation against us is enough to outline our defense and guerrilla attacks
 kosa kaa ishaara saaf tha - jab sarkaar maowad virdohi abhiyaan ke bare main bayaanbaji kar rahi thi to naksali us ilaake main jagah-jagah barudi surangen lagane ke saath-saath apane kader ko taiyaar kar rahe the or mukhabiron kaa network failaa rahe the
 The same mistake is still pursuing the government
 usee daure main die gaye intervyuu main kosa ne kaha tha ki aap dekhnaa agle chah maheenon main ham kya karte hai
 Due to the heavy presence of security forces, we thought that this statement on camera would be nothing more than a boasting, but in April 2010, 76 soldiers were surrounded by Naxalites and then killed more than 100 soldiers within three months
 sarkaar pichley paanch saal se vahaan suraksha balon kii sankhya badha rahi he or aaj bastar main 15 hajaar se adhik ardhsainik bal hai, But has the presence of security forces changed the situation for a common tribal in Bastar? Has this reduced Maoist attacks? Has the government's development policies been able to get a foothold in Bastar
 sabhi sawaalon kaa jawaab na nahin to kam se kam koi vishwaas bharaa haa bhi nahin he
 The biggest reason for this is that the honesty of the police system in Bastar and the credibility of the leaders is highly doubtful
 police ne aam adivaasiyon ke khilaaf jyadatiyon kaa jo silsilaa jari rakhaa he or jo farji mukademe kiye hai ve naksaliyon ke prachaar tantra ko oxigen dene ke liye kaaphi he
 In the light of day, the leaders who call Maoists bad, join hands with the same Naxalites for their benefit during the elections
 jab maovadi kisi colector yaa duusare adhikari ko agava kar lete hai to sarkaar maovadiyon ke saath kya samjhauta karti he kisi ko pataa nahin chalata
 The tribals of Sukma, Dantewada and Bijapur areas may be getting in trouble for a thousand times, but in these areas you will see the Timber Mafia with the most expensive Android phones
 inhen ilaakon main aapako sabase chamakdaar esayuvi ke maalik bhi milenge jo bataaenge ki naksalwad se nibatane main chal rahi yojanaon kaa kitna ‘phayda’ he
 a few years ago a forest officer transferred from Bastar to Korba told me that there is so much money in Bastar that anyone who goes there never wants to come back
 2010 main dantewada ke asipi amaresh mishra ne baatcheet main kaha ki police ke alaava yahaan har koi mouj kar rahaa he
 The question is whether Naxalism will be fought on paper or will be fought only by pushing the soldiers to death
 sarkaar ne apane javaanon se kaha he ki adivasee ilaakon main sirf goli na chalaaen balki vahaan jaakar logon kaa dilon-dimag bhi jeeten
 If winning the hearts of the people is also the job of the jawans, what will the leaders do? Does the government want the youth to do the work of the leaders' part as well? pehali baar chhattisgarh main netaaon par hamalaa hua he, lekin sari bahes naksalwad par simit ho gai he
 Shouldn't this question arise why the government could not provide security to the representatives of a political party even on the national highway? maowad par hone vaali bahes sarkaar ke liye phydemand he kyonki vah mukhya mudde se dhyaan bhatkaati he
 The government has been fighting against Maoism for the last several years, but if the Maoists come out of the far flung areas and start such a big attack on the National Highway, where there are two police stations within a radius of 10 km, will this fight against Naxalism Does not question the intention of ek sawaal naksalwad kii kawarej ko lekar bhi he
 Especially on TV coverage, after any Naxalite attack, experts get collected on all the channels and it becomes a big media event, but in these tribal areas people who are fighting against government policies in peaceful ways How much does the media cover them
 tippaniyan Is the story of tribals standing against Korean company Posco in Jagatsinghpur in Odisha not important for TV? The Naxalites are bloodshed, but why did the story of the eight tribals killed in the hands of CRPF cobra jawans at Edsametta in Bijapur on May 17 not shake the TV screen? dakshin bastar maovadiyon kaa garh he lekin adivaasiyon ke adhikaron kii baat karne vaale maovadi uttari chhattisgarh main apana ‘andolan’ kyon nahin failaa rahe jahaan khanijon kii lut sabase adhik ho rahi he? ye sawaal kisi akhbaar yaa tivi channel main kyon nahin uthte yaa rashtriya str kaa koi netaa yaa export is par kyon nahin bolta? After the interview ended, Kosa said that the Indian government had made a big mistake in this fight
 jab maine is galati ke bare main poocha to kosa kaa kahana tha ki hamaare khilaaf oparation shuru karne se pehle uskaa jitna vivaran sarkaar ne de diya he vah hamaari pratiraksha or chhapamar hamalon kii ruparekha banane ke liye kaaphi he
 Kosa's gesture was clear - when the government was making a statement about the anti-maoist campaign, the Naxalites were preparing their cadres and spreading the network of informers along with the landmines in that area
 yahi bhul ab tak sarkaar kaa peechha kar rahi he
 In the interview given in the same tour, Kosa said that you will see what we do in the next six months
 suraksha balon kii baari maujuudagi kii vajah se hamane sochaa ki camere par ye bayaan ek shekhi baghaarne se adhik kuch nahin hoga, lekin april 2010 main 76 javaanon ko naksaliyon ne gher kar maaraa or phir teen maheenon ke bheetar 100 se adhik javaanon kii hatya kii
 The government has been increasing the number of security forces there for the last five years and today there are more than 15 thousand paramilitary forces in Bastar, lekin kya suraksha balon kii maujuudagi ne bastar main ek aam adivasee ke liye halaat badale hai? kya isse maovadiyon ke hamale kam hue hai? kya sarkaar kii vikaas kii nitiyaan bastar main jor pakad pai hai
 There is no answer to all the questions, at least there is no faith yes
 isaki sabase badi vajah he ki bastar main police tantra kii eemaandaaree or netaaon kii vishwasaneeyata behad sandigdh he
 The continuation of excesses against the common tribals and the fake cases that the police have done are enough to give oxygen to the propaganda system of the Naxalites
 din ke ujaale main maovadiyon ko bhala bura kehane vaale netaa chunaav ke vakt apane phaayde ke liye unheen naksaliyon se haath milaate hai
 When the Maoists kidnap a collector or other officer, no one knows what agreement the government makes with the Maoists
 sukama, dantewada or bijapur ke ilaake ke adivasee bhale hi hajaar mushkilon se dochaar ho rahe hon, lekin inhen ilaakon main aapako timber mafia sabase mahange endride phone ke saath dikh jaaenge
 In these areas, you will also find owners of the brightest suvs who will tell how much 'benefit' is there in the schemes being done to tackle Naxalism
 kuch saal pehle bastar se korba main tabadalaa paae hue ek van adhikari ne mujhe kaha tha ki bastar main itnaa paisa he ki jo bhi vahaan jaataa he vah kabhi waapas aana nahin chahta
 In 2010, Dantewada ACP Amresh Mishra said in a conversation that apart from the police, everyone is having fun here
 sawaal yah he ki naksalwad ko kya kaagajon main ladaa jayega yaa sirf javaanon ko maut ke munh main dhakel kar ladaa jayega
 The government has told its jawans not to shoot only in the tribal areas, but also to win the hearts and minds of the people there
 agar logon kaa dil jeetna bhi javaanon kaa kaam he to netaa kya karenge? kya sarkaar chaahati he ki netaaon ke hisse kaa kaam bhi jawan hi karen? For the first time, leaders have been attacked in Chhattisgarh, but the whole debate has been limited to Naxalism
 kya ye sawaal nahin uthanaa chahie ki ek raajnneetik party ke numaayindon ko sarkaar neshnal hive par bhi suraksha kyon nahin de pai? The debate on Maoism is beneficial for the government as it diverts attention from the main issue
 maowad ke khilaaf to sarkaar pichley kai saal se lard rahi he, lekin agar maovadi dur daraaj ke ilaakon se baahar aakar neshnal hive par hi itnaa bada hamalaa karne lage, jahaan 10 kilometre ke daayre main do thane hon, to kya ye naksalwad ke khilaaf ladaai kii niyat par sawaal nahin uthaata? There is also a question about the coverage of Naxalism
 khaastaur se tivi par hone vaali kawarej ko lekar, kisi bhi naksali hamale ke baad tamaam channelon par export icttha ho jate hai or ye ek badi media event banati he, lekin inhen adivasee ilaakon main jo log shantipurna tareekon se sarkaar kii nitiyon ke khilaaf lard rahe hai unhen media kitna cover karata he
 The comments urisa ke jagatsinghpur main korian company posco ke khilaaf khadey adivaasiyon kii kahani kya tivi ke liye mahatvapurn nahin he? naksali khun kharaba kar rahe hai, lekin pichhali 17 may ko bijapur ke adsametta main siarpief ke cobra javaanon ke haath maare gaye aath adivaasiyon kii kahani ne tivi screen ko kyon nahin jhakzora? South Bastar is the stronghold of the Maoists but why are the Maoists not talking about the rights of the tribals spreading their 'agitation' in northern Chhattisgarh where the looting of minerals is happening the most? Why do these questions not arise in any newspaper or TV channel or why no national level leader or expert speaks on this? kosa kaa ishaara saaf tha - jab sarkaar maowad virdohi abhiyaan ke bare main bayaanbaji kar rahi thi to naksali us ilaake main jagah-jagah barudi surangen lagane ke saath-saath apane kader ko taiyaar kar rahe the or mukhabiron kaa network failaa rahe the

 a few years ago a forest officer transferred from Bastar to Korba told me that there is so much money in Bastar that anyone who goes there never wants to come back
 2010 main dantewada ke asipi amaresh mishra ne baatcheet main kaha ki police ke alaava yahaan har koi mouj kar rahaa he
 The question is whether Naxalism will be fought on paper or will be fought only by pushing the soldiers to death
 sarkaar ne apane javaanon se kaha he ki adivasee ilaakon main sirf goli na chalaaen balki vahaan jaakar logon kaa dilon-dimag bhi jeeten
 If winning the hearts of the people is also the job of the jawans, what will the leaders do? Does the government want the youth to do the work of the leaders' part as well? pehali baar chhattisgarh main netaaon par hamalaa hua he, lekin sari bahes naksalwad par simit ho gai he
 Shouldn't this question arise why the government could not provide security to the representatives of a political party even on the national highway? maowad par hone vaali bahes sarkaar ke liye phydemand he kyonki vah mukhya mudde se dhyaan bhatkaati he
 The government has been fighting against Maoism for the last several years, but if the Maoists come out of the far flung areas and start such a big attack on the National Highway, where there are two police stations within a radius of 10 km, will this fight against Naxalism Does not question the intention of ek sawaal naksalwad kii kawarej ko lekar bhi he
 Especially on TV coverage, after any Naxalite attack, experts get collected on all the channels and it becomes a big media event, but in these tribal areas people who are fighting against government policies in peaceful ways How much does the media cover them
 tippaniyan Is the story of tribals standing against Korean company Posco in Jagatsinghpur in Odisha not important for TV? The Naxalites are bloodshed, but why did the story of the eight tribals killed in the hands of CRPF cobra jawans at Edsametta in Bijapur on May 17 not shake the TV screen? dakshin bastar maovadiyon kaa garh he lekin adivaasiyon ke adhikaron kii baat karne vaale maovadi uttari chhattisgarh main apana ‘andolan’ kyon nahin failaa rahe jahaan khanijon kii lut sabase adhik ho rahi he? ye sawaal kisi akhbaar yaa tivi channel main kyon nahin uthte yaa rashtriya str kaa koi netaa yaa export is par kyon nahin bolta? Due to the heavy presence of security forces, we thought that this statement on camera would be nothing more than a boasting, but in April 2010, 76 soldiers were surrounded by Naxalites and then killed more than 100 soldiers within three months
 sarkaar pichley paanch saal se vahaan suraksha balon kii sankhya badha rahi he or aaj bastar main 15 hajaar se adhik ardhsainik bal hai, But has the presence of security forces changed the situation for a common tribal in Bastar? Has this reduced Maoist attacks? Has the government's development policies been able to get a foothold in Bastar

The government has been increasing the number of security forces there for the last five years and today there are more than 15 thousand paramilitary forces in Bastar, lekin kya suraksha balon kii maujuudagi ne bastar main ek aam adivasee ke liye halaat badale hai? kya isse maovadiyon ke hamale kam hue hai? kya sarkaar kii vikaas kii nitiyaan bastar main jor pakad pai hai
 There is no answer to all the questions, at least there is no faith yes
 isaki sabase badi vajah he ki bastar main police tantra kii eemaandaaree or netaaon kii vishwasaneeyata behad sandigdh he
 The continuation of excesses against the common tribals and the fake cases that the police have done are enough to give oxygen to the propaganda system of the Naxalites

 sawaal yah he ki naksalwad ko kya kaagajon main ladaa jayega yaa sirf javaanon ko maut ke munh main dhakel kar ladaa jayega
 The government has told its jawans not to shoot only in the tribal areas, but also to win the hearts and minds of the people there
 agar logon kaa dil jeetna bhi javaanon kaa kaam he to netaa kya karenge? kya sarkaar chaahati he ki netaaon ke hisse kaa kaam bhi jawan hi karen? For the first time, leaders have been attacked in Chhattisgarh, but the whole debate has been limited to Naxalism

 ) Then shake Himalaya
 phir kanpi kashmir kii dharti
 On the night of 5 September, there was such a shock in Doda and Kishtwar of Jammu and Kashmir that people escaped from their homes in panic
 sitambar main kishtwar ko kudarat kaa ye doosraa jhatka laga he
 So, should it be considered an ultimatum of nature, people are really scared of the constant stir in the Himalayas
 bhugarbheey kampan ne phir se khadaa kar diya he ek bada sawaal
 Are recurring shocks a warning of a major destructive earthquake in the future
 taaja maamle main jammu kashmir ke doda or kishtwar jile main 5 sitambar kii raat 11
 41 On earth, the people moved out of their homes in panic
 richter scale par isaki tivrata 4
 5 measured
 bukamp kaa centre kishtwar main dharti main 10 kilometre neeche tha
 Though there has been no news of loss of life or property in the area yet, people are badly scared
 agast se lekar abtak kishtwar main ye aathvaan bukamp he
 In the month of August alone, Kishtwar of Kashmir has trembled 6 times
 jammu kashmir hi nahin balki paas ke uttarakhand ke uttarkashi jile main bhi 6 sitambar kii subah 3
 a 5-scale earthquake was recorded
 yani uttar bharat main himachal kaa ek bada ilaaka lagaataar kaanp rahaa he
 The movement in the mountains of the Himalayas is increasing the beating of people all over the country because this part of India is very sensitive to earthquake
 uttar bharat or purvottar bharat kaa zyaadaatar hissaa bukamp ke maamle main kaaphi khatarnaak mana jaataa he or yahaan bukamp aane kii vajah himalay main chal rahi bhugarbheey halchal he
 According to plate tectonic theory, there is a collision between the Indian plate and the Eurasian plate in the Himalayan region
 bhartiya plate urasian plate ke neeche ghus rahi he or is vajah se is ilaake main bukamp aate rahete hai
 Every year, 40 to 50 millimeters of water are swept under the Eurasian Plate, and that is why the Himalayas are one of the most active regions of the world in terms of earthquakes
 baar baar lagaataar
 Yes, perhaps this is a warning of a big danger in the future
 haalanki vaigyanik is kudarti aapadaa se nipatane ke liye dinaraat koshish kar rahe hai lekin prakruti apane par aa jaae to phir kiski kya bisaat
 According to geologists, Kashmir is not shivering like this again and again
 bhuvigyaan main ek aisi theory saamne aa rahi he jo dehshat kii vajah ban rahi he
 It is believed that a devastating earthquake occurs in every region once in 100 years
 or ashanka he ki is baar baari kashmir kii bhi ho sakati he
 Earthquake
 
 
 ek aisa shabd jise sunakar achche acchon kii bolti band ho jaati he
 a terrible mood of nature that no one in the world wishes to see and meet, but the people of India, especially Jammu and Kashmir, have been facing this form of nature again and again in the last few months
 bhuvaigyanikon kii maane to himalay nateeja he dharti kii do badi tectonic platon ke bich ho rahi takkar kaa
 The collision between tectonic plants started about five million years ago continues to this day
 yahi vajah he ki himalay main bade bukamp aana koi nai baat nahin he
 But a theory is coming out that is causing panic
 wo theory he sismik gap theory
 According to this theory, there is a possibility of devastating earthquakes in areas where there have not been major earthquakes for the last 100 years
 jammu kashmir kaa ilaaka bhi bhugarbha ke isi theory kaa hissaa he
 7 in 1905 in Kangra, Himachal, in the Himalayas
 5 tivrata kaa khatarnaak bukamp aayaa tha jisame hajaaron logon kii maut hui thi
 After studying the major and minor earthquakes in the last years, geologists agree on the conclusion that a major earthquake can occur in the Himalayas
 jaankaron kii maane to bade bukamp yani 8 yaa isse zyada kii tivrata kaa bukamp jin ilaakon main aane kii ashanka he wo ilaake hai jammu kashmir, himachal pradesh, uttarakhand, nepal, bihar kaa tarai vaala ilaaka or assam
 It will be difficult for you to believe but in July 2013 only 19 earthquake tremors have been felt in India
 agast main to jalajle ke 21 jhatkon se dar gaye the log jabaki sitambar main abtak 5 baar hindustan kii dharti hill chuki he
 The gesture of nature is clear
 ab saavdhaan hamen rahanaa hoga
 Scientists are still trying to prevent earthquake in India
 uttarakhand ke tehri main ek ek aisi prayogshaala banaai gai he jahaan dharti ke kampan kii ek ek baariki ko parkhaa ja rahaa he jisase bhavishya main hindustan ko zyada mahfuj banaaya ja sake
 Scientists have reached the conclusion that there is a very dangerous earthquake in the Himalayas
 jiske aane par dharti kaanp uthegi, pahaad tharthara uthenge
 But everyone is silent on the question of when the earthquake is expected
 himalay main bade bukamp ke khatre ke maddenjar vaigyanikon ne obserwetary lagaai he
 Scientists are trying to catch any movement before a big earthquake and provide accurate information in time
 isi koshish ke tahat kedarnath dham se takreeban 50 kilometre kii duuri par tehri ke guttu ilaake main ek bukamp obserwetary banaai gai he
 Many things change during an earthquake that takes place inside the earth
 vaigyanikon ke mutabik guttu bukamp obserwetary main 11 jeeophysical paramitaron par najar rakhi ja rahi he
 Earth's gravity changes before a major earthquake and a change in the electromagnetic field is observed
 iske alaava groundwater main bhi badlaav hota he
 The presence of radon gas increases before the earthquake
 iske alaava bukamp jone main chattaanon main tut-foot bad jaati he
 All these changes can usually be seen two to 15 days before
 bhu vaigyanikon kaa maananaa he ki jab bhi kedarnath ke ilaake main bada bukamp aayega to usase pehle unako sanket milane chahie
 11 types of equipment have been installed in Guttu which can catch any major movement in the Himalayas in a blink of an eye
 jameen main aa rahi halchal jaanane ke liye jeepies sensor bhi yahaan par lagaae gaye hai
 With this, the tension around the fault and any change in the ground will be easily known
 jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki himalay ke is ilaake main bade bukamp kii ashanka bahut dinon se he
 Recently, there is a mild earthquake in all areas of Uttarakhand
 aise main kisi bade bukamp kii vajah se hone vaale nuksaan se bachane ke liye ye bahut jaruri he ki is bukamp kaa andaja aane se pehle lagaaya ja sake
 The Geophysical Lab of Wadia Institute in Guttu is trying to predict its arrival before a major earthquake
 agar aisa hua to ye bahut badi kamyaabi hogi or kisibade nuksaan se logon ko bachaaya ja sakegaa
 Scientists try to know whenever a major earthquake strikes
 lihaaja yahaan par maujuud sabhi upkarnon ko lagaataar on rakhaa ja rahaa he

 vot ke liye note maamle main kathith sanliptata ke aaropee samaajawaadee party (sapa) ke purv mahasachiv amar singh kii jamaanat yachika par bahes ke dauraan bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ke saansad or varisht vakil ram jethmalani ne kaha ki 2008 main hue vishwaas prastaav ke dauraan saansadon ke ghoose dene ke liye dhan unke muvakkil kii ore se nahin aayaa balki yah 'sambhavat: bhaajapa ke strot se aayaa'
 Jethmalani said in the court of Special Judge Sangeeta Dhingra Sehgal, "there is no charge against Amar Singh for raising money and giving money to anyone
" ’jethmalani ne apni daleel main kaha, ‘haal hi main loksabhaa main laalkrishna adwani ne kaha tha ki yah sting bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) dwaara pryojit tha
 The money came from some BJP source, Singh did not provide this money
 sting bhrashtachar ko ujagar karne ke liye kiya gaya tha
 This makes it clear that whatever they did was not illegal
 ’unhone kaha ki is maamle main sting aaparishan ek nijee channel dwaara kiya gaya or iskaa uddeshy bhrashtachar ko ujagar karnaa tha aise main saansadon dwaara jo kiya gaya usamen kuch bhi gaiyrkanoonee nahi tha
 Jethmalani told the court, "co-accused and alleged mediator Sanjeev Saxena (amar Singh's associate) in his earlier statement in the court has said that he gave money to BJP mps
 or aise main jab bhaajapa daawa kar rahi he ki yah uskaa sting aaparishan tha to dhan bhi party ke kosh se hi aayaa hoga
 'it is noteworthy that Amar Singh (55) was arrested on September 6 in the note-for-vote case and the court sent him to judicial custody till September 19
 bharat kaa abhinn ang he
 India's internal matter
 to phir bharat ke abhinn or aantarik kashmir main bahari deshon ke saansadon ke daure ko suvidhaayen kyon uplabdh karai ja rahi hai
 It is not yet clear why government arrangements were made for private visits of these mps when the Indian line was integral and internal
 srinagar ke ek hotel se baahar aa rahaa yah kafila ghati kii raajnneeti ke itihaas main ek ajeebogareeb dastak he
 The convoy of black cars is related to the sorting or darkening of dark clouds hovering over Kashmir
 bharat ab tak isi niti par chalata rahaa he ki kashmir aantarik maamla he lekin jis tarah se is darvaaze se videshi saansadon ko lekar kaali kaaron kaa kafila nikal rahaa he vah kashmir kii aatanrikta ko antarrashtriya rang de rahaa he
 Whether or not it will be debated, but this picture is also the first picture in the disturbed history of Kashmir which has never been seen before
 kashmir masale kii aantarikta bharat ke swabhimaan kaa bhi masalaa rahi he lekin uski zamin par videshi saansadon kaa yun guzaranaa kisi kaa dil dhadkaa rahaa hoga yaa kisi kii raajnneetik chetana shunya ho rahi hogi? is yatra kaa jo bhi makasad rahaa hoga lekin kafile kii yah tasviir un hindi pradeshon ke netaaon ke bich kis tarah se dekhi jaaegi, kya netaa is tasviir kaa bhi swaagat karenge ki kashmir kii dharti par third party yani tisare gut ko chalane kii ijazat di gai he
 Keep looking at this picture, this picture is a milestone in the history of Kashmir that starts with Sardar Patel and ends at Sardar Patel
 kya aisa nehru ke vakt hua tha
 If it was, what Sardar Patel would have said, it is the same question as if Sardar Patel would have been the first Prime Minister of India
 bada sawaal to yah he ki in saansadon ko bulaayaa kisne he? aakhir inke bulaane ke peeche homework kiskaa tha? is baat ko rahasy rakhaa ja rahaa tha magar rahasy se pardaa uth gaya he
 You would be surprised that on an sensitive issue like Kashmir, an NGO was taking initiative, sending emails and calling mps, which is India's policy on Kashmir that no third will interfere
 is email kii bhashaa bataa rahi he ki inke bulaane kii taiyaari main bharat utana bhi anjaan nahin tha, varna koi enjio yah email nahin bhej paata ki aap bharat aaen 28 aktubar ko pradhanmantri modi se mulaakaat hogi or 29 aktubar ko kashmir kaa daura hoga
 Think in Hindi or Bhojpuri, can you visit without the knowledge of the Prime Minister? Think about Avadhi and Maithili and see if the Ministry of External Affairs knew about this visit? Actually we may not know about this NGO, do not recognize their faces, but these people are not so anonymous
 aap is tasviir main dekhie
 The woman who is with the Prime Minister is Madi Sharma
 bharat ke sabase taqatvar netaa ke saath sahajata ke saath khadi maadi sharma ko twitor par maatr 2,427 log follow karte hai
 Madi Sharma describes herself as a social capitalist
 khud ko international bijness brokar kahati hai
 Education entrepreneur says
 spikar kahati hai
 They also have a website
 maadi kaa matlab mek e diference idiaz
 In her website, Madi Sharma writes that the parents of Ethnic Minority support their parents alone
 lekin maadi sharma un dalon ko kashmir ke liye nyauta bhejti hai jinaki raajnneeti ethnic minurity ke khilaaf he
 So is it a case of creating an image by using the help of the weak or is there a curtain behind which is something else
 khud ko international bijness brokar kehane vaali mahila kaa kashmir ke maamle main itnaa dakhal kaise ho saktaa he
 Who are these people who can promise to meet the Prime Minister with the European Union mps
 aakhir maadi sharma kii itane samvedansheel maamle main itani pahunch yaa bhoomika kaise bani
 Did this Madi Sharma NGO send an email to the mps of the European Union in the information of the Foreign Ministry of India
 hamaare sahyogi sanket upaadhyaay ko yah email mila he jisaki bhashaa bataa rahi he ki jis daure ko nijee bataaya ja rahaa he vah utana bhi nijee nahin he
 The caller must have already agreed with Prime Minister Modi that if these mps come, they will meet
 aakhir aisi kya zarurat pad gai ki bharat sarkaar ko kashmir jaise maamle main ek enjio kii madad leni padati he, ek mahila kii madad leni padati he jo khud ko international bijness brokar kahati hai
 Are brokers also dealing with Kashmir? Madi Sharma emails European Union MP Chris Davis on October 7
 davis ko likh rahi hai ki main is viipi daure kaa aayojan kar rahi hum taaki pradhanmantri modi se mulaakaat ho sake
 i consider myself fortunate to invite you; Modi wants to meet influential leaders of the European Union
 kya aap pradhanmantri modi se milanaa chahenge jo 28 aktubar ko hogi
 There will be a visit to Kashmir on October 29 and a press conference on October 30
 is pratinidhimandal main europe bhar se alag alag dal ke netaa honge
 There will be a tour for three days
 jahaaz or thaharne kaa prabandh intnereshnal institute of non ellite studies kii taraf se kiya jayega
 On October 8, Madi Sharma again emails Chris Davis and thanks him that it is nice that you have expressed a desire to join the tour
 main kuch viipi ke daure ko cordinate kar rahi hum
 i know that the purpose of this visit is to meet the Prime Minister, go to Kashmir and meet people freely there
 iske baad 10 aktubar ko maadi sharma kris davis ko phir email karti hai
 The subject says, an invitation to India, to meet Prime Minister Modi
 patr main maadi sharma ne likhaa he ki dear davis, aapane pradhanmantri modi se milane ke mishan main shaamil hone kii ichha jataai he, uske liye shukriya
 i would like to apologize that no more mps can be included in this tour, hence canceling the meeting scheduled for Thursday
 jab main bharat se aa jaaoongi tab aapke daftar se sampark kar milane kaa prayaas karuungi
 Chris Davis is a Member of Parliament in the European Union from North West, UK
 inhen do baar shreshth saansad kaa puraskaar mil chukaa he
 Chris Davis is a member of the Liberal Democratic Party
 kris davis ne daawa kiya he ki jab unhone bagair suraksha dalon kii gheraabandi ke mukt rup se ghoomane or kisi se bhi baat karne kii anumati maangi to unhen srinagar nahin jane diya gaya
 MP from North West England, Chris Davis, said he received the invitation on October 7, and he responded the very next day, but on October 10 it was said that the offer to summon him had been rejected
 lekin davis kii party ke duusare sahyogi srinagar gaye hai
 Davis has said in his statement that 'I am not ready to be part of any public relations campaign of the Modi government to show that all is well
 yah bahut saaf he ki kashmir main loktantric siddhanton se chhedchhad kii gai he or duniya ko chahie ki is baat kaa sangyaan le
 Davis said that many people from the region from which he is an MP have relations with Jammu and Kashmir, who wanted to talk to their relatives, listen to their voice which was not allowed to happen
 davis ne bataaya ki Women's Economic and Social Think Tank ne unhen bulaayaa tha ki 28 aktubar ko pradhanmantri modi se milanaa he
 To go to Jammu and Kashmir on October 29
 30 aktubar ko press conference hogi
 International institute for non-aligned Studies' has been paid for their arrival
 to is aayojan main do do sansthaaen lagi hai
 This whole event which was being described as private is not as private as it is written in the email on which date the Prime Minister will meet i
e
 the Prime Minister's consent must have been taken in advance, otherwise the date of meeting with them is not fixed
 to bhale hi yah daura european sangh kii taraf se aadhikarik na ho lekin bharat kii taraf se aadhikarik hi lagata he
 Would you like to know about the Women's Economic and Social Think Tank, which is capable of interfering with India's foreign policy and Kashmir too? ab jab yah baat saamne aa chuki he ki ek enjio ke zarie kashmir main third party kaa daura hua he, iske kya raajnneetik parinaam honge yah is baat par nirbhar karegaa ki hindi akhabaaron se yah sab soochnaaon ko kaise gaayab kar diya jayega
 How will this information be prevented from reaching millions of readers? lekin aisa kya hua ki bharat ko yah sab karnaa padaa? abhi tak bharat kii yah pratikriya hoti thi ki aantarik maamla he or aisi choti moti hulchalon se fark nahin padataa he
 India was not impressed by the discussion on Kashmir in the United Nations General Assembly held in New York
 kya bharat kashmir ko lekar abhinnata or aantarikta se antarrashtriyakaran kii taraf khud hi le ja rahaa he yaa kashmir kaa masalaa bharat ke nahin chaahate hue bhi antarrashtriya hota ja rahaa he? aaj aapane apane hindi akhbaaron main is daure kii khabar padhi hogi, ek baar phir se us khabar ko dekhie ki kya us khabar main in saansadon or inaki raajnneeti ke bare main vistaar se koi jaankaree di gai he?european sangh main 751 siten hai
 Of these, 73 mps have recently formed a group of extreme right parties
 haalanki inke bich rus se nazadiiki ko lekar do raay he magar yah gut 751 saansadon kii sansad main paanchavaa bada samooh he
 Parties and mps belonging to this group have come to India
 27 saansadon main se 22 dhur dakshinpanthi party ke hai
 Two mps belong to the center left parties
 france se aae 6 saansad neshlan raily ke hai jinaki netaa marine laa pe hai
 a group of six mps from Poland belongs to the Law and Justice Party
 britain ke paanch main se chaar saansad dhur dakshinpanthi party brexit party ke hai
 Three mps from the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Italy are from Center Right and two are from Center Left
 ek saansad germany kaa he
 alternative for Germany
 germany kii samachar agency doyache vela kii site par is party ke bare main detail pard rahaa tha
 In a way, this party believes in the bigotry of Christianity
 maanati he ki garbhpaat nahin hona chahie
 Must be single family
 inaki press conference main press ko aane kii ijazat nahin he
 If a reporter calls, a previously recorded message is received as a reply
 iske alaava alternative for Germany islam ko lekar hauvva khadaa karti he
 It spreads a variety of fears called Islamophobia
 maanati he ki yuddh kii tabaahi se or apane shaskaon kii yatnaa se batch kar aane vaale sharnaarthiyon ko germany main rahane kii ijazat nahin di jaani chahie
 Migrants should not be given any rights
 jo party is tarah kii raay rakhti ho uske saansad bharat aae hai or srinagar kaa daura karne gaye hai
 Similarly, it is important to know what is the policy of parties like Britain's party Brexit and France's National Rally
 iske pehle amareeki sinetter kris vaan holen ko bharat sarkaar ne jammu kashmir jane kii ijazat nahin di thi
 Chris wanted to see what was happening in the valley
 neshnal conference or pidipi ne ise piaar stant bataaya he
 Well today is World Internet Day and there is internet shutdown in Kashmir from 5th August
 14 lakh bachche teen maheene se skool nahin gaye hai
 Tenth examination was also held in Jammu and Kashmir on 29th
 bharat ke raajnneetik dal european sangh ke saansadon ko srinagar jane kii anumati par sawaal uthaa rahe hai
 When CPM leader Sitaram Yechury wanted to see his party's ailing leader Yusuf Tarigami, the Solicitor General of the Government of India Tushar Mehta protested in the court
 kaha tha ki jammu kashmir kii sthiti narmal he, lekin seetaram yechuri ke daure se shanti par asar padegaa
 His tour is political
 supreme court ne sharton ke saath seetaram yechuri or congress netaa gulam nabi azaad ko jane kii anumati di thi
 Now the Leader of the Opposition is asking on what basis European Union mps are being visited when they are not allowed to go
 congress netaa priyanka gandhi ne twit kiya he ki 'kashmir main european saansadon ko saiyr-sapata or hastkshep kii ijazat lekin bhartiya saansadon or netaaon ko pahunchate hi hawaii adde se waapas bheja gaya
 This is a very unique nationalism
 'satyapal malik to ab goa ke rajyapal ho gaye hai lekin jab jammu kashmir ke rajyapal the tab unhone rahul gandhi ko twit kiya tha ki aap kashmir aakar halaat dekh sakate hai lekin jab rahul gandhi srinagar pahunche to airport se hi waapas kar die gaye
 This incident is on 24 August
 sirf rahul gandhi hi nahin balki vipaksh ke 11 netaaon ko waapas kar diya gaya tha
 23 mps from European Union have gone to Srinagar
 phir kendiy mantri mukhtaar abbaas nakvi chaahate hai ki bharat kaa vipaksh kashmir kaa daura karne aae european sangh ke saansadon kaa swaagat bhi kare
 The way the European Union is separating from this tour is also interesting
 jisaki sansad main kashmir par charchaa hui thi aakhir vah apane saansadon ke daure se khud ko alag karne ko lekar utsuk kyon he
 Today, Theresa Griffin, MP in the European Union from North West Britain, tweeted that "it should be very clear that a group of far-right mps visiting Kashmir is not an official delegation"
 ve european sangh kaa pratinidhitiv nahin karte hai
 The shutdown in Kashmir should end and constitutional rule should be restored
 ham bhartiya prashasit kashmir kii aabaadi ko lekar behad chintit hai jinhen kai prakaar ke maanavadhikaar se vanchit kiya ja rahaa he
 We request the Government of India to fully restore human rights that are not being given to them
 'unhumanrights ke is twit main bhartiya prashasit kashmir kaa istamaal kiya gaya he
 After all, what did the Government of India achieve by granting permission to these mps, or else this move of the Government made the matter of Kashmir internationally more vocal
 haal hi amareeki sansad ke videsh maamalon kii samiti dakshin asia main maanavadhikaar ke sawaalon par poochtacha kar rahi thi
 Many people appeared before this committee

 The question is whether the visit of EU mps is an invitation from India to a third party in the issue of Kashmir
 bihar main mukhyamantri nitish kumaar or lalu prasad kii partiyon ke bich gathbandhan kaa maamla kis raste par bad rahaa he? kahin usee raste par to nahin jis par janata parivaar kii gaadi kaaphi dinon tak raftaar pakadi rahi?paswan kii bhavishyavaaneekendriya mantriramvilas pasvanaki ek tippanee jo kahin se bhadra nahin kahi ja sakati, par sahi bhavishyavaanee sabit hui he

 Two things were discussed in the Central Hall amidst heated up in Parliament
 pehali ye ki sushamaa swaraj ne apane twitor handle se videsh mantri kaa zikr kyon hataa diya
 People were whispering about whether they were getting discharged or whether they themselves resigned

 duusari baat jo central haul main charchaa main rahi wo tha shashi tharur ko sonia gandhi kii daant
 Actually, a statement by Shashi Tharoor had come that Congress should be allowed to run the Parliament, disrupting Parliament will affect the image of the party
 sonia gandhi ne tharur ko party kii ek andruni meeting jo sadan shuru hone se pehle ho rahi thi, main sabake saamne danta ki aap aisa na kiya karen, aap pehle bhi aisa kar chuke hai
 Sonia was furious as some mps complained to Sonia about Tharoor that they go against party discipline
 is daant ke baad rahul gandhi ne halaat ko sambhala or saansadon ko lekar lok sabha main chale gaye
 The second thing that was discussed in the Central Hall was the scolding of Sonia Gandhi to Shashi Tharoor
 darasal, shashi tharur kaa ek bayaan aa gaya tha ki congress ko sansad chalane dena chahie, sansad baadhit karne se party kii chhavi par asar padegaa
 Sonia Gandhi rebuked Tharoor in an internal meeting of the party which was taking place before the House began, that you should not do this, you have already done this
 sonia gusse main thi kyonki kuch saansadon ne sonia ko tharur ke bare main shikaayat kii thi ki wo party anushaasan ke khilaaf chale jate hai
 After this scolding, Rahul Gandhi handled the situation and went to the Lok Sabha with the mps

 In fact Sophie has two uterus at birth

 This pain starts from the day of their menstruation and lasts for 72 hours

 Sophie has had two wombs since birth

 However Sophie has also once felt a labor pen and is the mother of a child

 But if the trailer, which is releasing on April 5, will be an extension of the trailer, then there is a strong possibility that the film should be used to make fun of Modi more than he is promoting
 aisa ghatnaon kii atinaatakeey prastuti kii vajah se ho saktaa he

 modi ne apatkaal ke dauraan akhil bhartiya vidhyaarthee parishad ke netaa ke rup main ullekhneey kaary kiya tha
 But during the emergency in front of Indira in the trailer, Modi is framed in such a way that he is seen as a very big leader who leads the opposition in emergency
 trailor se saaf pataa chalata he ki jamkar modi kii chhavi gadhane kii koshish hui he
 In this, Modi has been shown as a leader for whom the country matters more than religion
 trailor main modi ke bachapan kaa bhi ek prasang he
 At one place, Modi is seen saluting the tricolor
 jab modi ke saath maujuud doosraa baccha sawaal karata he ki wo aisa kyon karte hai, modi kaa jawaab he "tu mandir ko dekhakar aisa kyon karata he
 "based on the trailer, one can say that the entire journey of Modi will be shown in the film

 isi dauraan unhone kaha ki modiji ne fasebuk, watsap or twitor ko logon ke bich prachlit kiya he
 Even now the Chief Ministers of the states are using social media platforms

 garmi shuru ho chuki he or anil das ke kehane kaa matlab yah he ki saadhaaran bikri 25 fisadi ghat gai he yani, 75 fisadi rah gai he or aane vaale kuch dinon main jab garmi or bad jaaegi, to yah ghat kar 50 fisadi rah jaaegi
 Almost all of India starts the summer season from March onwards and sales of cold drinks increase during this period
 lihaaja isi anupaat main chaay kii bikri ghat jaati he
 Therefore, the profit for tea related companies is less in this season
 lekin barish or uske baad thand kii shuruyaat ke saath sahaj andaja lagaaya ja saktaa he ki bazaar main phir se ek baar chaay garm hone lagati he
 That is, when the weather is hot, the tea and coffee industry remains cold and these stocks are also likely to remain at a low level
 iske vipareet mausam thanda ho to chaay-coffee udyog garm hota he or iske anuroop hi in sheyaron main teji kii sambhaavna rahati he
 So, in the summer, if you have patience with a target of about 6 months by investing in some good fundamentals related to tea and coffee, then the fruit can get sweet
 assam company (india) limited, bombay burma trading karporation limited, harrisans malayalam limited, jayshri tii and industry limited, macleod rasel (india limited) or tata global bevarej stock exange main sachibaddh chaay udyog kii pramukh companiyaan hai, jinke sheyaron kii keemat in dinon kaaphi kam he
 Data from the Tea Board shows that tea plants in the eastern and northeastern region are in dormancy during the winter season and hence the production in January, February and March decreases significantly
 isliye desh main chaay kii kul nilaamee bhi ghat jaati he
 Kala, an advisor to the Tea Board, said that keeping the tea safe for auction in a period of short production is not beneficial for the business as it deteriorates its quality
 isliye ise utpaadan ke baad turant bechnaa hota he
 Kala said that tea is produced in the normal rainy days
 isliye isaki nilaamee bhi barish ke dinon main adhik hoti he
 According to Tea Board data, tea production is generally the lowest in the country during the period from January to April
 board kii website ke mutabik bharat main assam ghati or kachaar tathaa pashchim bengal main duers, tarai or darjeeling chaay ke baganon ke pramukh kshetra hai
 While Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Karnataka are the major areas of tea production in South India
 jahaan tak niryaat kii baat he to board ke website par maujuud aankadon ke mutabik uttar or dakshin bharat main july se disambar yani kaarobaari saal kii duusari or teesri timahi main desh se chaay kaa sarvaadhik niryaat hota he
 Even on the tea price front, according to the board data, the price is lowest in the month of January to March in the auction in both North and South India
 jabaki april se disambar yani pehali, duusari or teesri timahi main keemat aam taur adhik rahati he
 It is the highest, especially in the second quarter
 samgr taur par dekha jaae, to kaarobaari saal kii chauthi timahi chaay utpaadakon ke liye sust kaarobaar kaa maheenaa hota he
 For companies selling tea to consumers, however, the first quarter (april – June) of the business year is a sluggish period
 desh kii pramukh chaay company tata global beverejes limited ke tetali kanjumar care ke adhikari rajesh sharma ne is baat kii pushti karte hue kaha ki garmiyon ke maheene april se june main chaay kii bikri ghat jaati he
 He said, 'due to heat consumption of soft drinks among customers increases and tea consumption decreases, whereas tea consumption increases during the winter months
 ' garmiyon or thand main bikri ke antar ke bare main unhone kaha ki thand ke mausam main garmiyon kii apeksha bikri 20 fisadi bad jaati he
 So if small businessmen invest in the shares of tea producing companies between January and March and in the shares of companies selling tea to consumers between April and June and be patient for about six months, then they should eat sweet fruits as a better profit

 imran ne mana- kashmir par phayda nahin hogatoun main mudda uthaane se nahin hoga phydamerica press ke saamne sweekaari batpakistan ke pradhanmantri imran khan ko aaj sanyukt raashtra main sambodhan dena he
 Prior to his address, he once again has the rant of Kashmir and said that he has come here only to raise the issue of Jammu and Kashmir
 lekin sambodhan se pehle hi imran ne hathiyaar daal die hai or kaha ki vah jaanate hai isse koi phayda nahin hone vaala he
 Speaking to New York Times editors, the Pakistani Prime Minister said, 'I know that my speech at the UN will not have a major impact on Jammu and Kashmir, especially in the coming days
 
 
 lekin vah chaahate hai ki jammu-kashmir kaa masalaa duniya sune
 It is clear from Imran Khan's statement that he will certainly raise the issue of Kashmir on the United Nations platform, but he does not see any hope from it
 gauratlab he ki isse pehle bhi imran khan ne jahaan bhi jammu-kashmir kaa masalaa uthaaya he unhen vahaan par maat hi mili he
 Imran Khan said here that the decision India has taken for Jammu and Kashmir is against the rules and he had no idea that it could be opposed
 agar sanyukt raashtra is maamle main dakhal nahin detaa he to phir koun degaa?aapako bataa den ki pakistan ke pradhanmantri ne isse pehle america raashtrapati donald trump ke saamne bhi is masale ko uthaaya tha, lekin koi phayda nahin hua tha
 Donald Trump has spoken about mediation on the Kashmir issue, but has also said that this can happen only when India agrees to it
 lekin bharat bhi saaf kar chukaa he ki ye dwipaksheeya masalaa he or pakistan se tabhi baat hogi jab vah aatankwaad par baat karnaa chahega
 When is Imran's speech at the United Nations? India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address the United Nations General Assembly at 8 pm tonight
 piem modi ke bhaashan ke baad hi imran khan kaa sambodhan he, agar imran kashmir kaa masalaa uthaate hai or bharat par aarope lagaate hai to bharat kii ore se pratinidhi aaropon kaa jawaab denge

 Before the MCD elections in Delhi BJP, everything did not look right
 aisa isliye he kyonki nayaa pradesh adhyaksh banane ke baad se hi alag alag gut ke netaa party main apana varchasv kaayam karne kii hode main uljhe hue hai
 The competition started only after Manoj Tiwari became the president
 aisa mana jaataa he ki ve sanghathan ke lihaaj se dilli main nae nae hai or party kii andruni raajnneeti se bhi waakif nahin he
 The latest case is in the absence of Tiwari to set up a separate core committee to interview MCD election candidates
 jiske baad naaraaz tiwari ne ab party kii kor cameti kii meeting bula lee he
 The first meeting to be held on 26 February has now been called on 22 February in Anan Phanan
 sutron ke mutabik tiwari samanaantar kor cameti banane ko lekar naaraaz hai or upi chunaav prachaar ke bich main dilli aakar is meeting ke jariye wo party ke bheetar apni takat kaa ehsaas karaane kii koshish main hai
 The appointment was made after the defeat in the assembly elections; the BJP High Command made Manoj Tiwari the president of Delhi so that after the debacle in the assembly, the party could be revived
 alag-alag khemon main banty bijepi ko ekanutral netritvmil sake
 Whereas after Manoj Tiwari became the president, new equations have started forming within the Delhi BJP
 manoj to kuch or hi kehete hanmanoj tiwari kaa kahana he ki party kii kor cameti pehle se hi tay he
 This includes all mps and former presidents
 saath hi emsidi chunaav ke liye koi alag se cameti nahin banane kii baat bhi manoj tiwari ne kahi he
 After this, there are speculations that Tiwari is angry with the interference of Shyam Jaju, in-charge of Delhi BJP
 party ke andruni sutron ke mutabik shyaam jaju unki gairmaujuudagi main na sirf party netaaon kii baithak le rahe hai balkiamsidi chunaavamein tikaton ko lekar bhi khaasi dilchaspee dikhaa rahe hai
 In today's meeting, bjp's top leaders and public representatives will be called Budhwar (today), along with all the mps of Delhi, three General Ministers of Delhi BJP and Leader of Opposition in Delhi Assembly have been called
 mana ja rahaa he ki tiwari is baithak ke jariye party ke bheetar hi ye sandesh dena chaahate hai ki ve dami adhyaksh nahin he
 In such a situation, even though Tiwari may be able to deliver the message, the trouble started within the BJP before an MCD election does not overwhelm the party's electoral mood
 bangladesh daure par team india ne vanade siries 2-1 se ganvaa di
 The victory of the last match gave some satisfaction to the cricket fans but left some big questions in the mind which may get answers in the coming days
 team main sab thik nahin he or iskaa najaara vanade siries ke dauraan dekhne ko mila
 There is no doubt that Bangladesh played excellent cricket but it cannot be denied that Team India lost the series due to their mistakes
 team india kii haar ke paanch bade kaaran the-1- team main foot-siries ke pehle match se khilaadiyon ke bich talmail kii kami najar ai
 Team India captains Cool Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Virat Kohli both said that the dressing room environment was not correct in the gestures
 kohli ne tisare vanade se pehle kaha kivishwaas ke saath kuch faisle nahin liye gaye jiske chalate team ko nuksaan pahunchaa
 Dhoni said after the second ODI that my problem is not the captaincy but the atmosphere of the dressing room
 2- viraat kohli kii gairjimmedaarana ballebaaji-puri siries main viraat kohli kaa balla dhang se nahin chalaa
 Virat was very much discussed during this series
 pehle, duusare or aakhri vanade main viraat ke out hone main gendbaaj se zyada unka khud kaa yogadan tha
 Apart from this, in the second ODI, Virat was seen playing defensive shot on a free hit ball
 aise main viraat kaa role is haar main kaaphi bada najar aayaa
 3- Team combination-dhoni is a captain who likes to tamper with playing XI
 is siries main har match main plaing ilevan main badlaav najar aayaa
 Ajinkya Rahane was in the first match and Ambati Rayudu replaced him in the second
 tisare or aakhri match main bhi plaing ilevan main do badlaav kiye gaye
 In the last match, Ravindra Jadeja and Bhuvneshwar Kumar were removed from the playing eleven
 4- tej gendbaaji par 'maathapai'-puri siries ke dauraan team india apane tej gendbaajon se pareshaan rahi
 Mohit Sharma, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Umesh Yadav and Stuart Binny all raised Dhoni's headache
 dhaval kulkarni kuch had tak safal rahe lekin wo bhi bahut kuch khaas nahin kar sake
 Fast bowling has become such a big headache for Dhoni that after the last match, he said that now is the time to decide whether we want a fast bowler or good
 tej gendbaaj puri siries main kaaphi mahange sabit hue
 5 - Batless batting - Except for the last match, the batting of Team India has also gone through average in both the earlier matches
 dhoni or shikhar dhawan ko chhodkar koi bhi ballebaaj kuch khaas pradarshan nahin kar sakaa
 The partnership against Bangladesh was crumbling as soon as it was formed
 ek ballebaaj ne agar chor sanbhale rakhaa to duusare chor se wicket girte ja rahe the
 Now with this breathless batting, defeat against Bangladesh was certain
 dilli ke pahadganj ilaake main ek vivaahita kii sandigdh halaat main jal jane se maut ho gai
 The family alleges that their daughter has been burnt to death by her in-laws
 haalanki police ise aatmahatya kaa maamla bataa rahi he
 The incident happened in street number 10 of Paharganj
 jahaan 40 varshiya mahila bubbly ghar ke bathroom main buree tarah sejalihui haalat main mili
 When he was rushed to the hospital, doctors declared him dead, police say, adding that he set himself on fire in the bathroom with kerosene oil
 kyonki vah apni beemaari se pareshaan thim
 Their operations were also scheduled to take place
 jabaki vivaahita ke maayke paksh kaa aarope he ki unki beti kihatyaki gai he
 He was being tortured at his in-laws' house
 lekin police unka paksh nahin sun rahi he
 Attacking Narendra Modi, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Sunday said that even though the people of Gujarat have created the Gujarat model, bjp's prime ministerial candidate Modi is getting credit for it
 rahul ne mumbai ke upnagareey kshetra bandra main ravivaar shaam ek chunavi raily ko sambodhit karte hue kaha, 'vikaas kaa gujarat model rajya ke liye logon ne taiyaar kiya he
 Before Modi, people were sleeping and doing nothing
 ' unhone kaha, 'kya aisa he ki gujarat 60 saal tak so rahaa tha or modi aae tathaa unhone sara paridrishy badal diya
 The textile and diamond artisans were working hard
 lekin nahin, har cheez modi ne kii he
 This is his thinking
 'rahul kii raily nirdhaarit samay se kareeb chaar ghante der se shuru hui kyonki rahul raily sthal par shaam paune saat baje pahunche
 NCP chief Sharad Pawar was also scheduled to attend the rally but his absence raised many questions
 unki jagah ensipi ke mantri jayant patil stage par maujuud the
 Patil said that Pawar could not reach the rally site due to a mess in the helicopter
 party sutron ne bataaya ki mul kaarykram ke anusaar congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ko bhaag lenaa tha lekin unhone swasthya kaarnon se apana maharashtra daura radd kar diya
 Sachin Tendulkar, who has been called the 'god' of cricket in India, has landed at Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium to play his 200th and last Test
 bharat ne toss jitkar pehle gendbaaji kaa faisla liya he
 Now Sachin will probably get a chance to bat tomorrow

 bharat main cricket kii lokapriyata se takkar le paanaa sambhav nahin dikhataa lekin agar ham south india, north-east, goa or kolkata kii baat karen to footbal ke aage cricket kahin nahin tikta
 India's National Football League, i-league has completed eight years, on this occasion, we thought why not give you a little information about the National Football League of India
 ai-lig ko south, north-east, goa or kolkata se nikaalkar puure bharat tak pahunchaaya jaae
 So read about the short introduction of i-league as well as the battle for its existence, when the big twist in Indian football, the major turning point in Indian football, which was suffering from identity crisis at the international level from the years, came when All India Football in 1996 The Federation (AIFF) established the National Football League
 bharat kii is pehali neshnal domestic lig kaa pehla khitaab jesiti club ne jeeta
 However, the league did not achieve much success, and only after 10 years, announcing the reorganization of its i-league in 2006-07, from the 2007–08 season, it was divided into two divisions (i-league, i-league- 2) divided into
 dempo bane tha pehla vinarais lig ke niyamon ke mutabik ai-lig ke har sijan kii samaapti par ankon ke aadhaar par sabase neeche rahane vaali do timen religat hokar ai-lig-2 main chali jaati hai
 While two teams performing poorly in the i-league are relegated every year, two teams performing well in the i-league-2 get promoted to the i-league
 24 sitambar 2008 ko ai-lig kaa pehla match goa ke do klbon, dempo sporting club or saalganvkar epasi ke bich khelaa gaya
 Goa's Dempo Sporting Club, which won the first i-league, has won the i-league title the most times
 duniya ke sabase puraane klbon main shaamil hai mohan bagan or east bengaldiggaj team east bengal ke naam is lig main sabase zyada 194 maichon main jeet ke saath hi lagaataar 22 maichon tak ajey rahane kaa bhi record he
 The i-league, which has some of the oldest teams in the world like East Bengal and Mohun Bagan, has not been very popular since its inception
 darasal bharat main footbal ke kaamyaab naa hone ke peeche iskaa ek vishesh kshetra tak simit ho janaa jimmedaar he
 If we talk about football in India, it is limited to north-east, Kolkata, Goa and now Maharashtra and Bangalore
 koi bhi khel agar kisi aria vishesh main simit ho jaataa he to phir uske liye neshnal level par impact bana paanaa lagbhag asambhav ho jaataa he
 The football governing body of our country, All India Football Federation, is defeated in this matter
 nahin mil paa rahi apekshit lokapriyatahalanki AIFF ne footbal kii lokapriyata badhaane ke liye apane str par koi kami nahin chhod rakhi lekin uski koshishon kaa koi khaas phayda hota nahin dikh rahaa he
 There has been no season in the i-league when teams have not fluctuated
 gauratlab he ki ai-lig kii sthapana se ab tak ke aath saalon main bahut si tiimon ne vibhinn kaarnon se ai-lig main khilne se manaa kar diya he
 Most of the teams have been shut down due to economic reasons
 haalanki aarthik halaaton main to utaar-chadhaav aata hi rahata he lekin iske chalate lagaataar klbon kaa band hona jarur chintajanak hai
 The ongoing merger of ISL and i-league is going to tell you that three teams have decided to close their teams, refusing to participate in i-league this year
 tiimon kii pareshaaniyon ko dekhte hue AIFF ne aagaamee kuch saalon main ai-lig or iesail ke vilay kaa man banaaya he lekin dekhne vaali baat yah hogi ki ye kab tak ho paata he
 Along with this, it will also be seen how much this step benefits Indian football

 For the monsoon session of Delhi Legislative Assembly starting on Tuesday, the Delhi government has made strict rules for the media

 Former Indian cricketer and Navjot Singh Sidhu, who started a new innings as a Hindi commentator on Star Cricket, termed the role of Sachin Tendulkar as very important for the Indian team going through a change, saying that the master blaster has the bat Sudarshan Not a cycle that gets success all the time
 ’tendulkar pichhali das pariyon main keval 153 ran bana paye hai jisase yah sawaal uthne lage hai ki kya unhen team main bane rahanaa chahie
 Sidhu, however, dismissed Tendulkar's criticisms and said that in the current era the country cannot even think about his retirement
 siddhu ne kaha, ‘hamaare paas madhyakram vivies lakshmana, rahul dravid or saurav ganguli nahin hai
 We are in dire need of experience and should not even think about Tendulkar's retirement till we get a choice
 tendulkar ke lagaataar asafal rahane ke sawaal par siddhu ne kaha, ‘sachin bhagwaan nahin he, vah bhi insaan he
 He does not have a Sudarshan Chakra bat and bats occasionally misses
 jab unki aalochana hoti he to dukh hota he kyonki sachin shakhsiyat nahin sanstha hai
 He is a Kohinoor and cannot be made of glass
 hira hameshaa hira rahegaa or mujhe puri ummid he ki agle do maichon main vah vaapasi karenge
 Sidhu, who has played 51 Tests and 136 odis for India, feels there is no other option but to turn wickets in the current series against England but he feels that it is necessary to have a leg-spinner in the Indian team
 unhone kaha, ‘ham yahaan tej yaa sapaat wicket nahin bana sakate
 Therefore, we have no option but to make turning wickets
 itnaa jarur he ki team leg spinner rakhana jaruri tha
 History is also witness that England batsmen were in trouble in front of leg-spinners like Sivaramakrishnan, Shane Warne, Anil Kumble, Amit Mishra
 ’siddhu ne iske saath hi khulaasa kiya ki unki chayansmiti ke adhyaksh sandip patil se bhi is bare main baat hui thi
 According to him, Mishra and Piyush Chawla are still recovering from injuries and hence their names were not considered
 unhone kaha, ‘maine sandip bhai se baat kii thi
 He told that Amit and Chawla are still recovering from injury
 matlab ye he ki chayansmiti chaahati he ki ve chot se ubarne ke baad kam se do-teen match khel le
 About the introduction of Hindi commentary on Star cricket for the first time in India, Sidhu said, 'star cricket has made history
 yah itihaas main darj hoga kyonki is desh main 90 pratishat log yah chaahate hai

 tripuraamen chunaav hone se takreeban chah maheene pehle indigenus piples front of tripura (ipift) ke ek varisht netaa ek nijee sankat se guzar rahe the—unke putr ko dil kii beemaari thi or ilaaj ke liye unhen kaaphi dhan chahie tha
 Assam Finance Minister Hemant Biswa Sarma was then on a state visit to prepare for the bjp's campaign
 unhen ipift netaa ke sankat ke bare main pataa chalaa
 Although he did not know the leader personally, Sarma had known well-known cardiologist Dr
 devi shetty ko phone kiya or guwahati ke narayan hridayalay main bachche ke muft ilaaj kii vyavastha kara di
 The child is successfully treated and Sarma finds a friend for life
 is saal janvari main jab sarama bhaajapa or ipift ke bich gathjod kaa taana-bana bun rahe the (donon pakshon ke varisht netaaon ke virodh ke baavjood), to ipift main unke nae dost ne ise amali jama pehanaane main ahm bhoomika nibhaai
 By that time it seemed like an impossible task
 ipift janajatiyon ke liye alag ''switzraland" rajya kii maang kar rahaa tha jabaki bhaajapa rajya ke kisi bhi vibhaajan ke khilaaf he
 Sarma says, "it is politics to manage the contradictions
 " sarama ne chunaavon se pehle ipift ko apni yah maang chhodie ke liye taiyaar kar liya
 After the results of the elections, the IPFT resumed this demand, although Sarma is not at all distracted by it
 ve kehete hai, ''assam main hamaara do saal se bodoland piples front (bipief) se gathbandhan he
 They too have been demanding a separate Bodoland state
 aise saare masalon ko baatcheet se suljhaayaa ja saktaa he
 "the BJP-IPFT alliance was very important in 20 tribal-dominated seats in the state
 ipift ne vahaan nau siten ladiin or aath jeetin or bhaajapa ne das
 In this way, they eliminated the left parties from their stronghold itself
 guwahati univasti main professor nani gopal mahant kaa kahana he, ''purvottar main bhaajapa kii ''kshetriyakaran" kii raajnneeti ke jhandabardaar sarama hi hai, jisamen ve sahakaari or pratispardhaatmak dhaanche ke saath kshetreey partiyon se milakar bahurange gathbandhan kaayam kar rahi he
 This model was first effective in Assam
 unke nijee network se ab yah model nai oonchaaiyaan chhu rahaa he
 "the special thing about Sarma's electoral politics is to anticipate and stop the hurdles beforehand
 18 farvari ko hue tripura chunaav se ek saal pehle hi sarama ne is baat ko mahasoos kar liya tha ki makapa virdohi mat bante hue hai
 Several Congress leaders were already in touch with him, including those who had joined the Trinamool Congress in Tripura
 haalanki bhaajapa ke tripura ke prabharee sunil devdhar or rajya adhyaksh biplav deb unhen party main shaamil kiye jane ke khilaaf the
 Sarma waited for a while and then got his chance before the presidential election in July 2017
 sanyukt vipaksh se milane vaali chunauti kaa saamana karne ke liye bhaajapa ummidavaar ram nath kovid ko tripura main tiemasi ke sadasyon ke samarthan kii darkaar thi
 An agreement was reached in Guwahati with the consent of party chief Amit Shah that they would support Kovid in the elections and later the BJP would join him in the party
 agast main tiemasi ke chah vidhayak—sudeep roy burman, ashish saaha, pranjit es
 Roy, Diba Chandra Harnakwal, Dilip Sarkar and Biswa Bandhu Sen joined the BJP
 sarama kaa anumaan sahi sabit hua jab ye chhahon bade antar se chunaav jite
 But the great war in Tripura was to gain the support of tribes
 makapa 20 arakshit janajaatiy siton se saalon se jitati aa rahi thi
 The reason for this was the division of anti-left votes into Congress and other tribal parties
 congress main apane ateet ke chalate sarama party ke kai netaaon ko jaanate the or unke liye parade ke peeche se samarthan jutaney kaa vaada unhone kar diya tha
 But the challenge was to form coalitions with tribal parties
 tripura vidhansabha kii 60 siton main se 36 siton (inamen 20 arakshit siten bhi shaamil hai) par janajatiyon kaa prabhaav he
 Also, the pair of Deodhar and Deb were also against an alliance with tribal parties as they feared losing the dominant Bengali vote
 phir bhi sarama ne ipift ke saath gathbandhan taiyaar kar liya
 To make it work, he held two overnight meetings with the IPFT leaders at Taj Vivanta in Guwahati
 uske baad ve ipift ke mukhiya en
 C
 debabrahma ko lekar pradhanmantri narendra modi or grih mantri rajnath singh se milane gaye
 Apart from this, he also convinced the IPFT faction led by Rajeshwar Debbrahma to merge with BJP
 sattadhari tikdisarma kaa kaam gathbandhan banane tak hi nahin rukaa
 BJP President Amit Shah (after an internal survey) handed him a list of 10 "important" constituencies
 tab sarama ne apane das khaas logon ko—inamen mantri, vidhayak or party kaaryakarta, sab shaamil the—assam se in chunaav kshetron main bheja or unhen matdaan ke din tak vahaan jamaaye rakhaa
 The party has always kept a chartered aircraft ready in Guwahati so that they can come and go anywhere immediately if they need it
 khaasaa napa-tula jamini kaam or bhaajapa kii baari-bharkam chunavi mashinari, ye donon hi matdaan ke din sarama ke bharose kii badi vajah the
 He told India Today that morning, "our first target is 34 seats
 phir yah badhkar 45 tak ja saktaa he
 "as a result, BJP got 35 seats and IPFT eight
 nijee rishton or chunavi ganit ke prabandhan kii is raajnneeti kii hi badaulat is purv congress netaa ne (ve bhaajapa main july 2015 main hi shaamil hue the) lagbhag akele dam par teen saal se bhi kam samay main samooche purvottar ko kesaria rang main rang diya he
 As Mathemasrama of Meghalaya was enjoying the taste of Tripura's victory on March 3, he received a nervous call from party chief Amit Shah
 congress ne party ke diggaj netaaon kamalnath or ahamed patel ko meghalaya bheja tha taaki ve rajya main congress ke netritv main gathbandhan sarkaar bana saken
 The Congress became the single largest party with 21 seats in the results of the 60-member assembly
 bhaajapa kii saathi neshnal piples party ne 19 siten jiti thim or bhaajapa ne keval do, haalanki inke bich chunaav se pehle koi samjhauta nahin hua tha
 He needed the support of the United Democratic Party (UDP), the Hills State People's Democratic Party (HSPDP), the People's Democratic Front (PDF) and the independents to form the government and all these could go in any corner
 chartered flite kii taraf jate vakt sarama ke chehre par tanaav ke koi nishaan nahin the
 He was whistling to the tune of an Assamese film song in which he acted as a child actor — Ek Dui Tini Chari, Juti Dilu Garu Gari (ek Do Teen Char, Meri Baalgaadi ki Baat)
 ve jaanate the ki ve sahi raste par the kyonki yah jang to ve kai maheenon pehle hi jeet chuke the jab ve endie ke saathi dalon—udipi, echespidipi or peedief ke netaaon ke saath baithe the
 In the Christian-dominated Meghalaya, it was difficult for the BJP to find pre-election partners as there was strong opposition against the party's Hindutva agenda and "beef" politics
 lekin tamaam partiyaan ek anadhikarik samjhaute ke liye raji thim, kyonki ek aise rajya ke liye centre main sattarudh party se haath milakar chalanaa zyada vyaavhaarik ravaiya najar aata he jo apane rajasav ke liye mote taur par centre ke anudaan par nirbhar rahata he
 Sarma was helped by a common gesture against Congress Chief Minister Mukul Sangma

 "on the other hand, the BJP leadership was pressurizing NPP President Konrad Sangma to enter into a pre-poll alliance
 conrad jaanate the ki aisa koi gathbandhan unki party ke liye aatmghaatee ho saktaa he
 An NPP leader said, "had the pre-election alliance been in place, the Congress would have eliminated everything in the election
 "conrad kehete hai, ''hamane manipur or nagaland main bhi chunaav se pehle koi gathbandhan nahin kiya tha

 The Supreme Court in the order reinstated the Congress government and the party almost resolved its internal crisis by replacing the then chief minister Nabam Tuki with Pema Khandu, the leader of the rebel faction
 iske baad shah ek baar phir sarama ke paas gaye or unase kaha ki ve khandu ko bhaajapa main shaamil hone ke liye raji karen
 Sarma has had a longstanding relationship with Khandu as both stayed in the same party
 itanagar or guwahati main khandu ke saath kai baithkon ke baad sarama ne unhen ek samjhaute ke liye raji kar liya—16 sitambar, 2016 ko khandu ne congress chhod di or 43 vidhayakon ke saath ek choti party pipuls party of arunachal (pipie) main shaamil ho gaye jo enidie kaa hissaa thi
 With this, it was decided that if there is a disturbance, the BJP will not be accused
 par sankat khadaa ho gaya kyonki congress khandu ko phir se waapas laane ke liye unhen manaane main lagbhag safal ho gai
 On December 29, Khandu and six other mlas were dismissed from the PPA for anti-party activities

 Mission Manipur Congress was the largest party with 28 seats in the 60-member Assembly of Manipur on March 11, 2017, while the BJP got only 21 seats

 But Sarma wanted to make sure that in the long run, there would be no problem for a looser ally government like NPF, so they continued to force Congress mlas
 aakhirkaar july, 2017 main congress ke 10 vidhayak bhaajapa main aa gaye or party ko akele hi purna bahumat hasil ho gaya

 ek mashhoor qawwali ke bol hai, 'chadhataa suraj dhire-dhire dhalataa he dhal jayega
 
 
 'has this line now begun to fit Team India's explosive batsman Virender Sehwag? Are the doors of Veeru's return to Team India closed forever? These questions are troubling Veeru as much as his fans
 apni aatishi or saahsee pariyon ke liye duniya bhar main lakhon cricket premiyon kii dil kii dhadkan bane najafagarh ke nawab virendra sahvaag kaa kariyar ab haashiye par jaataa dikhaai dene laga he
 Veeru's name is once again not included in the squad announced for the t-twentyth and first three odis against Australia
 haalanki sawaal ye bhi uthta he ki agar sahvaag kaa chayan hota bhi to kis buniyaad par? 2012 se lagaataar unke form main giravat hi darj kii gai he, viru ne 2012 main das vanade maichon main mahaj 21
 Scored 217 runs at a modest average of 70, including a half-century
 vahiin agar baat 2013 kii karen to, unhone sirf ek vanade khelaa or pari ko 31 ranon se aage nahin le ja sake
 In the recently concluded Challenger Trophy, Sehwag decided to bat in the middle order, but Veeru failed there too and managed to score only 72 runs in three matches, which was insufficient to impress the selectors
 vaise bhi captain em es dhoni tii-twanti or vanade main ab shikhar dhawan ke saath rohit sharma se pari kii shuruyaat karaane ke paksh main hai, jabaki middle order main viraat kohli, suresh raina, yuvaraj singh, dhoni or jadeja ke rahete sahvaag kii jagah nahin banati
 So is the return of Sehwag, who played the greatest innings in ODI cricket, impossible now? However, Sehwag has a chance to return to the Test team
 westeindies e ke khilaaf hone vaale do anofitial test maichon main ve bharat-e kii taraf se khelenge or agar yahaan par ve damdaar pradarshan kar paane main kaamyaab rahete hai to chayankartaaon par dabaav jarur banegaa, lekin ise vidmbana nahin to or kya kahenge ki baavjood iske bhi viru kii raah asana nahin rahegi, kyonki jab australia ke viruddh bharat ne apni antim test siries kheli thi, us samay salaami ballebaaj shikhar dhawan or murali vijay donon shandaar form main the or unako peeche dhakelkar team main jagah bananaa viru ke liye aasaan nahin hoga
 So shall we assume that Sehwag, for whom the bowlers around the world trembled with fear, was the Sehwag for whom Sir Vivian Richards had said that he was willing to spend even money to watch Sehwag's game
 At one time, the glow of veterans like Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly was blurred, the Sehwag who gave a new dimension to Indian cricket, have their stars now gone to greed? pichley saal safal pyaaj yojana (anian deal) ke baad i-commers company gruphon india ne ab spice safar ke saath milakar rail deal kii peshkash kii he jiske tahat upabhoktaaon ko rail tikaton par 100 rupee kii chhot milegi
 Under this scheme, starting on Thursday, groupon India will offer 1,000 coupons for Rs 9 everyday
 is coupon ke jariye upabhokta spice safar aplication ke jariye tikat kharidne par 100 rupee kii chhot praapt kar sakate hai
 Groupon Chief Executive Ankur Wariku said, “last year we sold 23,000 kg of onions under the onion scheme
 ham aisi yojana pesh karnaa chaahate the jo sabakaa dil jeet le
 We all travel by rail but there is no concession on it
 ’unhone kaha ki aaj kii is yojana se upabhoktaaon ko yah phayda bhi milegaa
 He said that both companies will bear the cost of the concession as the Railways does not give any concession
 haalanki unhone iskaa koi byoraa nahin diya
