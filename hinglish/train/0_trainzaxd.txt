 However, Governor ESL Narasimhan has said that Naidu should continue in office till the process of formation of the next government begins
 2014 ke chunaavon main wiesar congress ko 67 or tidipi ko 103 siten mili thim
 In such a situation, the question arises as to what was the reason that YSR made a spectacular comeback and TDP lost power
 2013 se 2017 tak tidipi or endie gathbandhan main the lekin chandrababu naidu kaaphi samay se andhra pradesh ke liye modi sarkaar se vishesh rajya ke darje kii maang kar rahe the
 The Center turned down the demand for their special state status
 jiske baad tidipi adhyaksh or andhra pradesh ke mukhyamantri chandrababu naidu ne modi sarkaar ko jhatka dete hue endie se apana naata tod liya tha
 The TDP minister resigned from the central government and the BJP minister resigned from the state government in Andhra Pradesh
 lekin endie se alag hone par tidipi ko nuksaan hi uthaanaa padaa
 The general public opinion in Andhra was that Narendra Modi is the right leader for the Center and Chandrababu Naidu is right for the state
 lekin endie se alag hone ke baad naidu ne piem modi par hamalaa karnaa sharu kar diya or jis samay desh main sargical strike hui or bijepi ke paksh main hawa bani, tab naidu ne piem par sawaal uthaae
 Naidu also had to bear the brunt of this and the people of Andhra were angry with him
 naidu ke man kii mahatvakanksha ne bhi unhen haar dilaai
 Naidu continued to meet many opposition leaders across the country to form a coalition government at the center, due to which the people of Andhra were very confused as to what Naidu wanted? Because he has been a part of manipulating many coalitions before
 unki badhati hui mahatvakanksha ko log pachaa nahin sake or aakhir main naidu haar gaye

 apane pichley lekh 'kya ab sanbhalegaa pakistan
 
 
 ? i had mentioned about how Pakistan has adopted duplicity policy on terrorism
 kis tarah 'acha aatankwaad' or 'bura aatankwaad' main fark kar rakhaa he
 Pakistan has always been calling and giving protection to terrorists who have created unrest and instability in India and killed innocent Indians by bomb blasts everywhere
 ek kadava sach yah bhi he ki pakistan kaa astitv hi bharat virdohi niti ke kaaran bachaa hua he, varanaa yah kab kaa tuutakar bikhar jaataa
 After the suicide terror attack in the school of Peshawar on Tuesday, the world felt that Pakistan would now improve
 pakistani pradhanmantri nawaz sharif ne bhi ol party meeting main jab faisla liya ki ab pakistan achche or bure taliban main fark nahin karegaa or jab tak aakhri aatankwaadi ko khatm nahin kar degaa, chaiyn se nahin baithegaa, to har 'tivi-nirmit' dephence export kehane laga ki pakistan ke nawaz sharif sahi disha main kadam uthaa rahe hai, lekin jald hi un export mahanubhaavon kii galatfahami dur ho gai
 Common people in Pakistan are being told that India has carried out these attacks
 aaj bharat ke vishwaas ko us samay gaharaa dhakka laga, jab pakistan kii ek court ne mumbai hamale ke aaropee or hafiz said ke daahine haath zaki-ur-rahamaan lakhvi ko jamaanat par reeha kar diya
 It was argued that there is no strong evidence against Lakhvi
 lakhvi ne hi ajmal kasaab samet nau logon ko training dilwaai thi or unhen hathiyaar muhaiyaa karwaae the or unhen samudr ke raste mumbai pahunchane main madad kii thi
 Earlier, in the year 2009, the Lahore High Court had dismissed and released Hafiz Saeed for all the charges of the Mumbai attack, and keep in mind, it is the same Hafiz Saeed, who has been declared the 'most Wanted Terrorist' by the whole world
 And on which America has a reward of about 60 crores
 vah hafiz said bhi pakistan ke liye begunaah he
 Poor India continued to send dossiers on the dossier, but they might not have been enough for the court of Pakistan
 usee hafiz said ke bharat ke khilaaf propaganda karne ke liye pakistan sarkaar special train chalaati he
 And now the same Hafiz Saeed is blaming India for the Peshawar attack
 khaybar pakhtoonkhwaah ke peshawar ilaake main schuli hamale par bharat ne kathor shabdon main ninda kii thi
 Every person here was involved in the grief of the suffering parents of Pakistan
 menstream media se lekar soshal media main bharatiyon ne hamale kii bhartsana kii, lekin pakistan main kuch or hi nazaaraa he
 Intellectuals like Zaid Hamid there were doubting India's intelligence agency 'RAW' regarding this attack
 hafiz said baar-baar tivi par aakar bharat or bharat ke pradhanmantri ko hamale kaa doshi tehra rahaa tha, kah rahaa tha, "hukumat, fouz or avam sab is baat par ikattha ho jaaen ki in sajishon se hamane badla lenaa he, or india, jo is khel kaa asal zimmedaar he, usase badla lenaa he
 
 
 We fully understand that India is behind these intrigues
 
 
 aaj magarmach ke aansu bahaane vaala modi, nawaz sharif ko phone karne vaala, yah asal muzarim he
 
 
 We have to introduce its crime
 
 
 " Poor tehreek-e-taliban
 
 
 hafiz said jaise janata ke rahanuma unhen credit hi nahin de rahe, so, unhone pehle ek pravaktaa se kahalwaya ki taliban ne yah hamalaa uttari wajiristaan main chal rahe faujee oparation 'zarb-e-azb' ke badale main kiya he, jisamen 1,800 se zyaada aatankwaadiyon ko pakistani fouj ne maar giraaya, or phir harkar becharon ne buudhvaar ko hamalaa karne waalon kii tasviren bhi release kar deen
 Hafiz Saeed is not such a big man that India should answer him, but some people living in India, who hope for peace from Pakistan, feel that the perception about India is changing in Pakistan now
 ab vahaan kii janata bharat ke saath he
 Only those in power, ISI, army and terrorist organizations are against India
 bhai, bachaa kya he
 
 
 The If the public is considered close to India, then the next line is enough to change your mind
 51 fisadi pakistani janata bharat ko sabase bada khatra samajhati he
 This was revealed by a May 2014 survey by Pew Research Center of America
 71 fisadi pakistaniyon kii raay bharat ke bare main acchhee nahin he
 The most noticeable thing has come out from this survey that 80 percent people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa region consider India as the biggest threat
 yah vahi ilaaka he, jahaan mangalvaar ko 150 se zyaada schuli bacchon kii jaan le lee gai
 Now if Hafiz Saeed is telling the people there that India is behind this attack, then why not the people of Peshawar will consider India's sympathy as hypocrisy
 
 
 ? There will be few Pakistanis who do not consider India as their enemy, who can be counted on fingers
 ye ve log honge, jinke yaa to paariwarik rishte bharatiyon se jude hai yaa jinke aarthik hit bharat se jude hai
 If all the four provinces of Pakistan - Punjab, Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan - are combined, then it is anti-india policy, otherwise there are so many differences in language, ideas and leadership in all the four provinces that they are still Would have been separated and Pakistan would have been divided into four small countries

 mantri manish sisodiya ne dhamkee bhare andaaj main kaha, ''ham chune hue pratinidhi hai or police ko sudharkar dikhaaenge
 "if the demand to suspend the concerned police officers is not met, then the Iqbal government may fall
 dilli ke laksminagar se party vidhayak vinod kumaar binni ne 15 janvari ko ek baar phir vivaadee sur ched die
 Binny, who was denied the first minister and later the MP in the Lok Sabha, alleged, "arvind Kejriwal runs dictatorship in the party
" ” unhone agle din press conference kar or gambhir aaropon kaa khulaasa karne kaa daawa kiya
 These allegations began on the day when it was believed that the last date for applying for tickets was in AAP
 agle din binni ne samvaadadaataaon ke saamne tafasil se apane aarope rakhe, lekin unke aarope naitik or bhaavnaatmak zyada or tathyaatmak kam najar aae
 "everything in the party is decided by a quartet of old friends i
e
 Kejriwal, (manish) Sisodia, (kumar) Vishwas and Sanjay Singh," says Binny
 virdohi vichaaron ko suna hi nahin jaataa he
 Binny also cemented allegations of nexus between the congress-aap by saying Kejriwal and Sheila Dixit's MP son Sandeep Dixit's close friendship since the time of the NGO
 ve tikat bantwaare main bhi bhrashtachar kii baat karte hai or unke mutabik, janata se raay lekar tikat dene kii baat puri tarah sahi nahin he, kyonki bahut se ummidavaar pehle hi tay kar liye jate hai
 Arrogance in the clan: The allegations of dictatorship by his own people, although the allegations made by Binny were weak but gave a poor signal for the health of AAP running Delhi government with a very small majority
 pehle party netaa sanjay singh or yogendra yadav ne in aaropon ko khaarij kiya or baad main kejariwal ne kaha, ''party main vichaaron kii asahmati ho sakati he, lekin kisi ko anushaasanheenata nahin karne di jaaegi
 Action will be taken on Binny
 ” lekin mushkil yah he ki binni kii tarah kai vidhayak party kii kaaryastylee se naaraaz hai
 Another AAP MLA Surendra Singh, however, disagreed with Binny's manner but justified his "issue"
 lekin yah iklauta maamla nahin he, jab kejariwal ko rajkaaj kii bajaae apni party se jude kisi mudde par safai dene aage aana padaa
 Earlier, his friend, young poet Kumar Vishwas's old acts and new conceit have put the party in disarray
 jab se vishwaas ko rahul gandhi ke khilaaf amethi se loksabhaa pratyaashee ke taur par project kiya gaya he, tab se unke sur main badbolapan khub sunai detaa he
 In such a situation, the opposing parties are also engaged in uprooting the issues against them
 vishwaas kaa ek video utyub par daalaa gaya, jisamen ve kathith taur par muslim or sikh samaaj par aapattijanak tippanee kar rahe hai
 An alleged statement given from the stage in praise of Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi is adding to the party's troubles
 2009 ke is video main ve khule taur par modi ke dilli ke takht par baithne kii kaamana kar rahe hai
 Though Faith clarifies this, "if someone goes to recite poetry as a poet on his birthday, he cannot be abused
" ”varisht kavi ashok chakradhar ne dilli sahitya academy se jo istipha diya, uski vajah vishwaas ko mana ja rahaa he
 In the same atmosphere, social worker Mallika Sarabhai, who joined the party, termed Vishwas as immature
 jawaab main vishwaas ne talkhi se kaha, ''koun hai ye mallika sarabhai? main kisi mallika sarabhai ko nahin jaanata
 "how coincidental is the conviction that the statement of Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dixit matches with the historical sentence in which the Congress leader had said in a similar vein," Who is this Kejriwal? " Not only this, Vishwas has even said in a TV interview, "I am a bigger star than Arvind, Kejriwal and Manish Sisodia connected me to the movement because i can connect the youth with me
" iity-iiem main jab arvind mere saath jate the to yuvaaon kii bheed mere autograph ke liye mujhe gher leti thi or arvind peeche akele chhot jate the, lekin aaj log arvind ko gher lete hai or bheed main mujhe kohni lagati he
 "however, the beliefs also add that it does not matter
 jab kejariwal sarkaar ne 20,000 litre pani prati maah muft dene kaa faisla kiya tha to jal board ke siio ke saath press conference main vishwaas kii maujuudagi thik usee tarah samvidhanettar shakti kaa ehsaas kara rahi thi, jiske liye congress kii aalochana hoti he
 Dispute box: The hysteria created by the law is 'political slime' and this dirt can be cleared only by entering it
 ” isi jid ke saath jab kejariwal ne anna hajaare ke saamne janalokapal andolan se aage badaae kaa prastaav rakhaa to anna ne inkaar kar diya, lekin kejariwal apane faisle par ade rahe
 Ultimately, Kejriwal's insistence created history in the Delhi Assembly elections, but he is beginning to understand the difference between the movement and running the government
 dilli main aap sarkaar banaakar mahaj 20 din main haanfati dikh rahi he
 Law Minister Somnath Bharti of Kejriwal government has imposed a hat-trick of disputes within a fortnight
 dilli main jajon kii baithak bulaane ke mudde par apane sachiv se takaraav to bhrashtachar ke ek maamle main gavaah ko prabhavit karne ke maamle main adalati tippanee saamne aane se unke istife kii maang shuru ho gai
 Bharti made public the name of the Danish rape victim in Delhi, for which she had to apologize
 swasthya mantri satyendra jain kii samvedanheenata ek nijee aspataal main navjaat bachche kii laash ko koodaydaan main phenkane ke mudde par jaahir ho chuki he jab unhone ise nijee aspataal kaa maamla bataakar dakhal dene se inkaar kar diya tha
 Later Kejriwal intervened
 ab bharti kii vajah se dilli police ke saath sarkaar kaa takaraav itnaa bad gaya he ki kejariwal grih mantralay ke baahar dharna dene kii ranneeti bana rahi he
 If this happens, the state versus center fight would be extremely dangerous for the federal system
 mahila or bal vikaas mantri raakhi birla ne car ke kaanch chatakane ko apane upar hamale ke taur par badha-chadhaakar pesh kiya, jabaki is maamle main bachche or uski maa ne birla se usee vakt maafee maang lee thi
 Despite this, due to Rakhi's behavior, the frightened child and family left their home
 yahaan bhi mukhyamantri ko dakhal dena padaa or parivaar waapas apane ghar lautaa
 If AAP leader Prashant Bhushan created a ruckus by talking about the referendum on Kashmir, AAP had to distance itself from Bhushan's statement
 lekin yah maamla us vakt tool pakad gaya jab ek gumnaam hindu sanghathan 'hindu raksha dal’ ke kaaryakartaaon ne party ke gajiabad karyaalay par hamalaa bol diya
 After that Kejriwal gave an emotional statement, "if killing me and Prashant resolves the Kashmir issue, then wherever you say, we will come to die
" ”shapath ke liye metro kii sawari kar team kejariwal ne surkhiyaan batorin to agle din kai mantri saarvajanik parivahan auto, metro se sachivalay pahunche
 But within 24 hours, the minister started using the Innova vehicle with VIP numbers
 jabaki aap ne apane ghoshnaptr main viypi culture khatm karne kii baat kahi thi
 Betasha in every hand: In the circle of politics, the biggest challenge for the party promoting freebies is the swift steps taken to fulfill the promises
 muft pani or sasti bijli dene ke faisle ne sawaal uthaaya ki kya aap desh ko phir se sabsidi ke yug main le ja rahi he
 What is even more important is that in areas where there is no water supply, or where there is no available clean water, what will those areas get from such decisions? No intention was disclosed so far, while the party's manifesto talked about such a fundamental change
 muft kii yah raajnneeti aise samay par ho rahi he, jab donon kendriya partiyaan udaarikaran or sabsidi ghataane par sahamat hai, tab aise faisle karne se pehle is eemaandaar party ko apni aarthik niti ghoshit kar deni chahie
 The party will also get a policy challenge on the issue of FDI as these are no longer domestic issues
 desh in vishyon par kai tarah ke antarrashtriya qaraar karata rahaa he
 AAP, which dreams of emerging as the third national party in the country, will now have to open its policy cards
 bhale hi uske netaa khud ko sanbhaalane, dilli ko saadhane or loksabhaa kaa ran ladgaye main kitne hi vyast hon
 If there is more confusion on such issues, then it is very possible that the support of the party will start to fall in the middle class, which is crazy about the party at this time
 is bich arvind kejariwal ke sarkaar chalaane ke taur-tareekon par bhi sawaal uthne lage hai
 After swearing in Ramlila Maidan on December 28, he had promised a helpline number to fight corruption within two days, but it took more than a week to execute it
 iske baad bhi jab helpline jari hui to dilli kii janata khud ko thaga mahasoos karne lagi or kanoonvidon kii najar main yah aisa hathiyaar he jisase aam aadmi ko adalati pachadon main ulajhna pad jayega
 That is, to avoid the trouble, people were forced to pay bribe, now to avoid that bribe, more legal hurdles will have to be faced
 party ne janata darbar lagane kaa faisla bhi jor-shor se prachaarit kiya, lekin pehle din hi janata darbar main baari avyavashtha much gai
 The very next day, the Kejriwal government's sweat was extinguished and it was announced that now the government would not hold any public court
 isse aap ke aalochakon ko phir mauka mil gaya
 Congress general secretary Digvijay Singh quipped, "when i was the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh in 1994, i used to meet the common people six hours a day, two hours a week
" shila dikshit bhi dilli ke mukhyamantri ke rup main 15 saal tak yahi vyavastha apanaae raheen
 Arvind Kejriwal should take a lesson from Sheila Dixit
 ”mahatvakankshaon kaa boj:itane oonche vaade kar die ki nibhaana mushkilsarkaar banane ke baad bhi aap ke netaa yah baat samajhane ko raji nahin hai ki sangharsh kaa lomaharshak daur peeche chhot chukaa he or satta kaa aisa taj sir par he, jiske kaante dusron ko najar nahin aate, lekin pahanane vaale ko chubte jarur hai
 Kejriwal and his ministers are expressing helplessness and helplessness on many issues, as if they did not know in advance that Delhi is like this
 ve apane vibhaagon ko durust karne se zyada centre sarkaar ke vibhaagon main unki sunwaayee na hone ko lekar aahat hai
 He wants the entire government department of Delhi to work with passion like his party workers
 lekin yah badlaav kab hoga iskaa kisi ko nahin pataa or upar se loksabhaa chunaav sir par hai
 Therefore, Kejriwal wants to run the government on the strength of party organization instead of government machinery
 unki ek bhi ghoshnaa dilli sarkaar ke jansampark vibhaag se logon tak pahunchane kii bajaae party ke jansampark vibhaag se saarvajanik hui
 Even the number of the corruption complaint helpline does not appear prominently on the official website of the government
 unki bhalee icchhaaen, logon kii paaramparik soch or lalaphitaashahee ke nizaam ko apane saath kadamtal nahin kara sakin
 The AAP chief who beheaded Delhi on the issue of rape victim Nirbhaya, cannot understand that he is sitting on the throne of Delhi but cannot stop this misconduct
 is par congress netaa arvinder singh lavali ne kaha, ''aise hi maamle main hamaari sarkaar ke khilaaf aasmaan sir par uthaane vaali aam aadmi party ab chup kyon baithi he?” ab team kejariwal police ke dilli sarkaar ke maatahat nahin hone kii daleel dekar laachaari jataa rahi he
 The metro from which he went to Ramlila Maidan to take the oath, the employees of the same metro reached his house and started agitating for the job and they could not do anything
 unke vaadon kaa pahaad ab jan sailaab banakar dilli sachivalay par hiloren maar rahaa he
 If the first fortnight of the government was sacrificed on the ludicrous announcements, then the second week would have looked for clarification on the disputes
 unke liye ek makaan kii khoj apane aap main dilachasp kissa ban gaya he
 Riding expectations is dangerous
 sher kii sawari kii tarah khatarnaak
 When you are riding on the wave of expectations, you feel like being Mahabali but you cannot get off the back of the lion or from the wave of expectations
 yah maarak ho saktaa he
 AAP and its leader Kejriwal must have understood this thing within two weeks
 agar ve janata kii ummiido par khare utarate hai, jo mumkin he, to ve 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav nateezon ko prabhavit kar sakate hai
 If they fail, the result will prove to be bad for you as well as Indian politics because nothing is worse than the death of hopes and dreams
 diemke ne aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav main congress ke saath gathbandhan kii sambhaavna se saaf inkaar kiya he
 The DMK clarified that it had only sought the support of the Congress for the Rajya Sabha elections
 diemke ke varisht netaa or party ke koshadhyaksh emke stallin ne beeti raat kaha, ‘rajyasabha sadsy pad ke liye party kaa samarthan maangane matlab yah nahin he ki ham unke saath phir se aa gaye hai
 We will not have any alliance with the Congress for the next Lok Sabha election
 ’stallin ne kaha, ‘ham srilankai tamilon ke mudde par matbhed ke kaaran upie se baahar aae
 This disagreement still persists
 ’ unhone loksabhaa chunaav yaa vidhansabha chunaav main bhi congress ke saath gathbandhan kii sambhaavna se inkaar kiya
 After the ninth Lok Sabha at the Center (1989), for the first time in 2014, a party won more than a single majority and the Bharatiya Janata Party came to power
 iskaa asar sarkaar kii tamaam nitiyon ke saath videsh niti main bhi dekhne ko mila
 The head of the central government, PM Narendra Modi, emerged as the main determinant of India's foreign policy
 unhone duniya bhar ke rashtradhyakshon ke saath vyaktigat sambandh bhi viksit kiye
 During this time, India's foreign policy was in building a strong China in the neighborhood, maintaining peace in the South Asian region and bringing countries with shared cultural heritage
 bharat ko chote padosi deshon kaa saubhaahgya mila he, haalanki uske samaksh china kii pratispardhaa bhi rahi he
 As soon as PM Modi assumed the throne, the SAARC heads of state were called in his swearing-in, visited almost all the neighboring countries and gave the slogan 'neighborhood First'
 piem modi satta main chaar saal puure kar chuke hai or unke saamne purvavarti sarkaron jaisi gathbandhan kii majaburiyaan bhi nahin rahi hai
 In such a situation, we know how India has developed relations with its neighbors in these four years - 1- Maldives
 It is the only neighboring country of India where Modi did not go
 2015 main modi ko yahaan se hokar janaa tha, lekin raajnneetik uthal-puthal ke chalate unka daura tal gaya
 External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj visited here in 2014 and 2015
 2016 main maldives ke raashtrapati abdulla yameen bharat aae or donon deshon ke bich raksha, karadhaan, paryaton or spes research ke kshetra main samjhaute hue
 In the last few years, Chinese interference in the Maldives has increased
 2011 main maale main china ne apana duutavas kholaa
 In December 2017, the Maldives passed a disputed 'free Trade Agreement' (FTA) with China at midnight without the presence of opposition mps
 china kaa dakshin asia main maldives ke alaava keval pakistan ke saath hi FTA he
 From here Maldives went closer to China than to India
 bharat ne is ghatnakram par chintaa jaahir kii
 After this, relations between the two countries worsened
 maldives ne bina purv anumati ke bhartiya rajdoot se milane vaale apane teen sthaneey councilors ko suspend bhi kar diya
 This was seen for the first time in the relationship between the two countries
 2- bhutanbharat ne apane is himalayan padosi raashtra kii kaaphi madad kii he
 In Bhutan, one of the least resourceful countries, India has helped build telecommunications and hydro-electric projects as well as hospitals, roads and bridges
 is desh se bharat ko koi sirdard nahin mila he
 Narendra Modi made his first visit to Bhutan after becoming PM
 iske baad bhutan ke piem shering togbe janvari 2015 main bharat aae
 However, India's relations with this country came to a major turning point in 2017 when a dispute broke out between the three forces at Doklam on the india-china-bhutan border
 is vivaad main pehle bhutan ne bharat ko nazarandaaj kiya, jabaki bharat ne kaha tha ki uske sainik bhutani sainikon kii madad karne doklam main gaye the
 This was a statement consistent with China, because China has been saying that India does not have a role in Doklam
 haalanki, kareeb teen maheenon baad duusare bayaan main bhutan ne bharat ko is vivaad kaa hissaa mana tha
 This was a diplomatic relief for India
 3- myanmarmyanmar kii dosti ke liye bharat or china ke bich kheenchaatan dekhne ko milti rahi he
 Myanmar has 5 million Chinese and about 4 lakh people of Indian origin
 sainya shashan ke dauraan duniya bhar main china hi myanmar kaa akelaa dost rahaa
 China accounts for one-third of the total foreign investment in Myanmar
 iske alaava myanmar-china kaa vyapaar myanmar-bharat ke vyapaar se teen guna zyada he
 Myanmar has been trying to maintain good relations with both countries
 haal hi main myanmar or bangladesh ke bich rohingya sharnaarthiyon kaa vivaad dekhne ko mila
 There was an aggressive campaign against the Rohingya Muslims settled in Myanmar, which was condemned all over the world and there were restrictions on this country
 is vivaad ko sulajhane main china ne baaji maar lee or ek teen sutreey sulah kaa formula diya
 Modi visited Myanmar in September 2017 and India had a chance to become a leader by resolving the dispute
 lekin myanmar ke naaraaz hone ke dar se bharat chuppi saadhe rahaa
 On the other hand, the NDA government also gave it religious color
 bangladesh ne bharat ke is rukh par niraashaa jaahir kii to bharat ne in sharnaarthiyon ke liye madad kii muhim 'oparation insaaniyat' chalaai, lekin tab tak der ho chuki thi
 India could neither find Bangladesh nor Myanmar
 4- bangladeshjulai 2014 main bharat or bangladesh ne 'international tribunel of da lau of da si' ke faisle ko mana or jal vivaad suljhaayaa
 In June 2015, Modi went to Bangladesh and a land border agreement was reached between the two countries and both countries also agreed to start bus services
 april 2017 main bangladeshi piem shaikh hasina bharat ain or bharat ne bangladesh ko raksha upkarnon kii kharid ke liye atirikt 50 karod dollar ke saath vikaas kaaryon ke liye 4
 Announced a $ 5 billion new credit line
 bangladesh main beete samay main iesas or duusare aatanki sanghathanon kaa khatra badha he
 This has made both countries stand together on counter-terrorism tactics
 bangladesh is ilaake main bharat ke 'be of bengal initiative for multi-sectoral technical and iconomic kooparation' (BIMSTEC) or 'bangladesh-bhutan-india-nepal' (BBIN) jaise abhiyaanon kaa bhi madhyam bana he
 Despite all this, the Teesta Water Agreement has not been reached between the two countries
 donon desh is par raji hai, lekin pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee ko is par aapatti hai
 General elections are due in Bangladesh by the end of this year and Sheikh Hasina would like to implement it
 bangladesh ne rohingya sharnaarthiyon ke mudde par myanmar ke khilaaf khadey nahin hone par bharat se naaraazgi jaahir kii
 However, India later provided help to the refugees
 5- srilankasrilanka dakshin asia main bharat kaa sabase bada vyapaarik saajhedaar he
 However, this neighbor of India has also intensified relations with China recently
 isaki vajah he ki jab pashchimi deshon ne srilanka ke purv raashtrapati mahinda rajpakshe par littey ke saath antim sangharsh main maanavadhikaron ke ulanghan kaa aarope lagaaya, china ne use arabon dollar kaa lone dekar vahaan nirmaan kiya or srilanka ko vittiya mushkilon se ubaara
 However, this country has come close to India after Maithripala Sirisena became the President in Sri Lanka
 sirisena gaddi sanbhaalane ke turant baad 2015 main bharat aae
 In March 2015 itself, the Indian PM became PM going to Sri Lanka after 28 years and also addressed the Parliament there
 may 2017 main modi phir srilanka gaye
 In May 2017 Sri Lankan PM Ranil Wickremesinghe arrived in China to attend the 'belt and Road Initiative' (BRI) conference and his country received an additional $ 24 billion loan
 iske baad disambar 2017 main srilanka ne hambantota bandargah ko 99 saal ke liye china ko lij par de diya
 This port may have an important role in BRI
 bharat kii chintaaon ke baad 2018 main srilanka ne aashwaasan diya ki is port kaa sainya gatividhiyon main istemaal nahin hoga
 Apart from this, Indians were also invited by Sri Lanka to invest in Hambantota
 aisa hua to isse bharat ko china par najar rakhane main aasaani hogi

 India's relations with nepalnepal have been good
 piem modi 2014 main nepal gaye or hydropavar or infrastracchar ke liye credit line 1 arab dollar kii
 During his visit, agreements were made in the field of tourism, medicine and agreement was reached on janakpur-ayodhya bus service which started on Modi's recent tour in 2018
 2015 main bukamp ke baad bharat ne nepal kii madad kii or 75 karod dollar kii credit line kii ghoshnaa kii
 Thus, after Modi's arrival, the initial relations between the two countries were good
 nepal main nae samvidhan nirmaan ke baad tarai kshetra main madheshiyon kii upeksha ke baad se donon deshon ke sambandhon main khatas ai
 The protesting Madheshis closed the trade route from India to Nepal
 nepal ne bharat par aghoshit aarthik nakebandi kaa aarope lagaaya
 In May 2016, Nepal canceled its visit to President Bidyadevi Bhandari and called back its ambassador
 yahaan donon deshon ke sambandh nimnatar str par pahunch gaye the
 After this, Modi went to Nepal this month and worshiped in the temple there
 vaise nepal main left front kii jeet ke baad bharat ke saamne chunauti he ki vah nepal ko china ke kareeb jane se kaise roke
 India also has to work for young politicians in Nepal's politics
 china is maukey kaa phayda uthaane kii koshish main he
 Nepal is also included in China's 'belt and Road Initiative' (BRI) plan
 7- afghanistafghanistan se sambandh sudhaarney ke maamle main bharat ko safalataa mili he
 He came to India in April 2015 after Ashraf Ghani became President in September 2014
 iske baad modi disambar 2015 main afghanistan gaye
 India gave Chital helicopters to Afghanistan to deal with the Taliban, helped to build the parliament there, created a $ 5 million relief fund for Afghan children suffering from heart disease and 'indian Council for Cultural Relations' (ICCR) scholarship Also extended to 2020
 june 2016 main modi phir afghanistan gaye, is dauranbharat ne padosi desh kepurniman ke liye 2 arab dollar kaa lone diya
 This is the highest on behalf of neighboring countries in Afghanistan
 donon deshon ne iran ke chabahaar port se transport connactivity sudhaarney kii koshish kii
 Pakistan has been refusing to give way to its trade
 chabahaar ke baad iran se bhi sampark kii sthiti behatar hogi
 Afghanistan also threatened Pakistan that it would cut off Pakistan's contact with Central Asia if it was not allowed to do business with India from wagah-attari
 afghanistan ke jariebharat central asia mensadak or railmarg tak pahunch banaakar china-paak ke gathjod ke prabhaav ko kam karne kii koshish main he
 India also transported a consignment of wheat to Afghanistan through Chabahar in October 2017
 iske alaava, bharat-afghanistan ne june 2017 main 'air fret coridor' launch kiya or disambar tak doosraa coridor bhi launch kar diya
 Apart from trade between the two countries, it will also become a medium of movement of people
 bharat lagaataar america ke saath milakar afghanistan main shanti laane ko bhi prayasarat he
 8- pakistan-pakistan relations have deteriorated since the 2008 Mumbai attacks
 haalanki piem modi ne in sambandhon ko sudhaarney kii bharpoor koshish kii
 Pak PM Nawaz Sharif came to India at the swearing in of Modi
 iske baad disambar 2015 main modi afghanistan se lautate samay achaanak lahore jaakar piem navaj sharif se mili
 However, the terror attack on the Pathankot airbase in January 2016 and the ISI being called into the country to investigate it, the Modi government was mired in controversy
 sitambar 2016 main jammu-kashmir ke udi sector main sena ke base par hue aatanki hamale ke baad sambandh or kharaab ho gaye
 Negotiations between the two countries at the level of the National Security Advisor also ceased
 donon desh ek-duusare par sijafire ulanghan kaa aarope lagaate rahe hai
 In September 2016, immediately after the Uri attack, India also carried out a surgical strike on the militant camps in Pakistan's land
 isamen bharat ne kareeb 40 aatankiyon ko maarane kaa daawa kiya
 However, Pakistan continues to deny this
 is dauraan bharat kii pakistan ko alag karne kii ranneeti kuch had tak safal rahi
 If the US stopped military aid to Pakistan, India's opposition to Hafiz Saeed's entry into politics could not bring color
 pakistan ko is dauraan china, rus or iran kaa saath mila
 Pakistan meanwhile succeeded in pulling India's friend Russia to its side
 kai masalon par donon saath aae
 The Russian Army also practiced with the Pakistani Army for the first time
 donon deshon ke bich sambandh ab bhi kharaab hai
 India has been consistently opposing the intervention of other countries
 donon deshon ke bich cricket sambandh behaal nahin ho sake
 9 - Apart from China and Pakistan, China has been the major determinant of India's foreign policy
 china se hi bharat ko pados or duniya bhar main chunauti milti rahi he
 China, through its 'belt and Road Initiative' (BRI), is making significant inroads in India's neighboring countries
 bharat ne china ke 'van belt van road' se judana sweekaar nahin kiya, kyonki 'china-pakistan iconomic coridor' naamak yah project pioke se hokar ja rahaa he
 India is worried about China being isolated from this effort and being surrounded by China from allied countries
 china kaa pakistan ke kareeb janaa bhi bharat ke liye chintaa kii baat he
 China is trying to establish its presence in Pakistan, Nepal and Maldives and is trying to improve relations with Bhutan
 in chaar saalon ke dauraan shi jinnping ne bharat kaa daura kiya, modi ne haal hi main china kaa anaupchaarik daura kiya
 There was tension between the two countries in Doklam over the border dispute
 dalai lamas ko lekar bharat or china ke rishte banate-bigadate rahe
 Recently, India shifted a program of the Dalai Lama to Himachal Pradesh on the objection of China and important ministers of the central government did not participate in it
 haalanki, sanyukt raashtra membharat ko phir sechin ke saamne majaboor hona padaa
 In December 2016, India wanted to declare Pakistan-based jaish-e-mohammed chief Masood Azhar a global terrorist
 yuan main china ke vito se yah nahin ho sakaa
 Their economy plays an important role in the rivalry between China and India
 china kii arthvyavastha bharat ke mukaable paanch guni he, isliye padosi deshon kii aarthik madad karne ke maamle main bharat uski barabari nahin kar saktaa he
 In such a situation, he will have to find better diplomatic routes

 The Bajrang Dal says that the Pakistan-sponsored terrorists, the stonemasons who covered them and their supporters and the alleged human rights activists are all found

 Bajrangdal sees any person or organization attacking our security forces with the same vision

 There is anger in the whole country and there is a lot of uneasiness in the public of India

 Along with these stonemasons of the valley, the army should be given a tough hand in dealing with them against their supporters so that they do not incur further sedition in the valley

 The comments lekin rajya ke iees afasaron kaa kahana he ki nitish kumaar kaa adhikariyon ke prati doharaa ravaiya hota he
 If Sudhir Kumar was arrested on suspicion, then spare the action against the then Education Department Principal Secretary Dharmendra Singh Gangwar in last year's famous merit scam, Patna Police did not even dare to inquire
 jabaki vaishali ke jiladhikari ne file main likhaa he ki gangavar ke aadesh par hi pariksha centre badla gaya
 Sudhir Kumar's Icon officers argue that his image is of a clean officer and action has been taken against him in retaliation

 Apart from this, there were two accidents in Patna during the time of Manu Maharaj, the head of Special Investigation Team constituted by Patna Police, but Nitish Kumar never took action against him

 Earlier, an emergency meeting of the State IAS Association was held in Patna on Sunday and after that IAS officers made a human chain in front of the Raj Bhavan
 ye haal ke varshon main pehali baar tha ki rajya ke iees adhikari rajya sarkaar yaa kahen police ke khilaaf sadakon par utre the
 Earlier, after the arrest of Sudhir Kumar, a delegation had also met Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and told him in two words that if officers are sent to jail for conducting the examination then no officer should refrain from conducting the examination in the coming days Would like isse shaayad hi rajya main koi niyukti ho paaegi
 According to experts, Nitish Kumar was also shocked to see the attitude of the IAS officers and he had also hijacked an officer to get very excited later
 tippaniyan But state IAS officers say that Nitish Kumar has a double attitude towards officers
 agar shankaa hone par sudhir kumaar ko giraftaar kar liya gaya, to pichley saal ke bahucharchit medha ghotaale main tatkaaleen shiksha vibhaag ke pradhan sachiv dharmendra singh gangavar ke khilaaf karrwai to chhodie, patna police ne poochtacha karne kii himmat tak nahin jutai
 While the District Magistrate of Vaishali has written in the file that the examination center was changed on the orders of Gangwar
 sudhir kumaar ke bachaab main iees adhikariyon kii daleel he ki unki chhavi saaf-suthere afasar kii rahi he or unke khilaaf badale kii bhaavana ke tahat karrwai kii gai he
 Former Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi has alleged that Sudhir Kumar, the father-in-law of Nitish Kumar's Principal Secretary Chanchal Kumar was sent to jail earlier, is being avenged
 iske alaava patna police dwaara gathit vishesh jaanch dal ke mukhiya manu maharaj ke samay main patna main do haadase hue, lekin nitish kumaar ne kabhi unke khilaaf karrwai nahin kii
 Apart from this, the Leader of Opposition Sushil Modi has also alleged about the investigator of the case, Rakesh Dubey, that Nitish Kumar never gave any important post till the time he was in BJP government due to his controversial background
 haalanki patna police kaa kahana he ki sudhir kumaar ke khilaaf karrwai khaskar giraftaar ke pehle pukhta saboot ikattha hone ke baad hi itnaa bada kadam uthaaya gaya he or rajya iees association bina matlab kaa til kaa taar bana rahaa he
 Sudhir never cooperated during the interrogation, but the family left Patna without informing after the involvement of the followers
 vahiin nitish kumaar ke kareebi log bataate hai ki unke shasankaal main na kisi ko bachaaya gaya he, na kisi ko fansaaya gaya hai
 But of course, this whole development is a big shock for Nitish Kumar during his more than 11 years of rule
 lekin rajya ke iees afasaron kaa kahana he ki nitish kumaar kaa adhikariyon ke prati doharaa ravaiya hota he
 If Sudhir Kumar was arrested on suspicion, then spare the action against the then Education Department Principal Secretary Dharmendra Singh Gangwar in last year's famous merit scam, Patna Police did not even dare to inquire
 jabaki vaishali ke jiladhikari ne file main likhaa he ki gangavar ke aadesh par hi pariksha centre badla gaya

 sarkaar ke is kadam kii shivasena or bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ne aalochana kii he
 This reduction in electricity rates will not apply in Mumbai, as the power distribution there is not in the hands of Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB)

 MSEB spokesperson said that its 2 in Maharashtra

 maharashtra main 36 lakh krishi upabhokta hai, 16 lakh vanijyik upabhokta hai, teen lakh audyogic upabhokta hai or ek lakh vidyut kargha hai
 The spokesman said that special consumers like railways are not covered by the decision
 is 20 fisadi katautee kaa matlab he ki emesaibi ko har maah 706 karod rupye kaa nuksaan hoga
 The government, however, will provide a subsidy of Rs 606 crore or Rs 7,272 crore annually to the MSEB
 baaki ke 100 karod rupye prati maah yaa 1,200 karod rupye salanaa nuksaan emesaibi ko uthaanaa hoga
 Earlier, Congress mps in Mumbai, Sanjay Nirupam and Priya Dutt had demonstrated against their own government demanding a reduction in electricity prices

 The controversy that arose after Anil Kumble resigned as the coach of Team India is not taking the name of calm
 kumble ne ek twit karke apane istife kaa kaaran bataate hue kohli se manmutav hone kii baat sweekaar kii thi
 On the other hand, after the resignation of Anil Kumble, the debate about the height and role of the coach and captain in Team India has intensified
 vaise bhartiya cricket ke liye ye mudda nayaa nahin he
 Earlier, apart from Greg chappell-ganguly, memories of disputes between John Wright and the team (players like Virender Sehwag and Zaheer Khan) are also fresh
 NDTV se khaas baat karte hue purv captain sunil gavaskar ne kaha ki shaayad yah bhi ho saktaa he ki anil kumble ne jis tarah se match fees badhaane ke lekar apana rukh dikhaaya, usase ho saktaa he ki board usase naaraaz ho
 But the point is that if the Cricket Advisory Committee has told Kumble that the captain has problems with you then it is very disappointing
 board ko agar lagata he ki captain hi bos he to coach kii jarurat nahin he
 He questioned the importance of the suggestions of the Advisory Committee
 unhone kaha ki team ko taiyaar karne kaa shrey coach ko jaataa he
 In such a situation, one cannot complain about Kumble's work
 unhone kaha ki agar kumble se judi samasya ko viraat vistaar se bataaen to team india or cricket ke liye behatar rahegaa taaki aane vaale bhavishya main in galatiyon ko na doharaaya ja sake
 The comments videshi coach ke sawaal par unhone kaha ki khilaadi kam khilne vaala coach chaahate hai
 Players want to see players with less experience as coaches
 kumble ke istife ko apmaan qaraar dete hue purv captain gavaskar ne kaha ki agar yahi haal rahaa to koi bhi varisht khilaadi team india kaa coach nahin bananaa chahega
 Talking exclusively to NDTV, former captain Sunil Gavaskar said that maybe it could also be that the way Anil Kumble showed his attitude towards raising match fees, the board may be angry with him
 lekin mudda yahi he ki cricket salaahkaar samiti ne agar kumble se kaha he ki captain ko aapse samasya to yah bahut hi niraashajanak he
 If the board feels that the captain is the boss then the coach is not needed
 unhone sawaal uthaaya ki salaahkaar samiti ke sujhaavon kii kya ahmiyat he
 He said that the credit for preparing the team goes to the coach
 aise main kumble ke kaam kii shikaayat nahin kii ja sakati
 He said that if the problem related to Kumble is detailed, it will be better for Team India and cricket so that these mistakes cannot be repeated in the future
 tippaniyan On the question of the foreign coach, he said that the players want the coach to play less
 khilaadi kam anubhav vaale khilaadiyon ko coach ke rup main dekhnaa chaahate hai
 Describing Kumble's resignation as an insult, former captain Gavaskar said that if this is the case then no senior player would want to become the coach of Team India
 unhone kaha ki team ko taiyaar karne kaa shrey coach ko jaataa he
 In such a situation, one cannot complain about Kumble's work
 unhone kaha ki agar kumble se judi samasya ko viraat vistaar se bataaen to team india or cricket ke liye behatar rahegaa taaki aane vaale bhavishya main in galatiyon ko na doharaaya ja sake

 We are talking about Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu here
 railway aajkal apni letlatifi ke kaaran charchaa main he, shaayad hi koi train time par chal rahi ho, par jab baat kisi bhi imargency kii aati he, to prabhu peeche nahi hatate, turant karrwai karte hai
 Many such incidents happened earlier, but the latest case is related to the request of a bride
 
 
 train kii deree kii vajah se shaadi kaa muhoort niklaa ja rahaa tha
 In this difficult situation, the groom remembered Prabhu through a tweet
 phir kya tha prabhu ection main aae or train ko muhoort se pehle pahunchaa kar duulhe-dulhan ko milane kaa avasar pradaan kiya
 The Baratamala that went from Bhojpur to Delhi belongs to Sushil Kumar of Bhojpur in Bihar who left for Delhi to marry the Magadh Express with 86 Baratis as a groom
 susheel kumaar ne maheenon pehle train main rigerveshan book karaayaa tha, lekin magadh express lagaataar let chal rahi thi, kabhi 6 ghante to kabhi 10 ghante
 There was already a knock in the mind of the people that it is not known whether the procession will reach Delhi in time
 baraat ravivaar ko aara se magadh express se dilli ke liye ravaanaa hui
 Train arrival time 11
 50 subah nirdhaarit he, lekin yah train ravivaar ko aara main hi thodi let raat 10:33 pahunchi
 Accordingly, the possibility of the train getting late began to increase
 duulhe ne hisaab lagaaya ki agar train 6 ghanta bhi let dilli pahunchi, to shaadi kaa somvaar ko shaam 6 baje kaa muhoort nikal jayega or yah ashanka sach bhi hone lagi, kyonki elahabaad pahunchate-pahunchate yah train 5:05 ghanta let ho gai
 The bridegroom asked the railway minister, the groom requested Prabhu
 duulhe ne railmantri ke twitor account or unke portal par shikaayat kii
 The groom wrote that the Magadh Express has been running 6 to 10 hours late for the past several days
 agar yah somvaar yani 15 may ko let hui to uske vivaah kaa shaam 6 baje kaa muhoort nikal jayega
 Only after this message, Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu immediately came into action
 do jodon ke is milan main rail baadha na bane, isliye unhone turant karrwai shuru kii
 As the train passes through Allahabad Railway Division of North Central Railway after Mughalsarai and Varanasi Division of North Eastern Railway, the Twitter complaint was referred to Lucknow by the Railway Ministry
 lakhanu se shikaayat ko elahabaad refer kiya gaya
 The Railway Minister alleviated the groom's troubles somewhat
 train elahabaad pahunchane tak 5:05 ghanta let ho gai thi, jabaki kanpur aane tak yah 5:45 ghanta pichad gai thi
 When the train reached Firozabad, it was 6:39 hours late
 udhar vadhoo paksh bhi train kii sust chaal se pareshaan ho rahaa tha
 Hence, the bridegroom was being repeatedly called from there and his location was being taken
 pareshaan duulhaa rail mantri ke twitor par baar-baar train ko tej chalaane kii guhaar lagaataa rahaa
 On the order of the Railway Minister, there was some relief and the train covered its time for two hours
 train nai dilli 4:55 ghante kii deree se shaam 4:45 baje pahunchi to duulhe ne raahat kii saans lee

 This is published directly from Syndicate Feed) (NDTV team has not edited this news
 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he) Gurmeet Chaudhary, after playing the role of Lord Ram in the popular television serial Ramayana, has reached the pinnacle of popularity, but he no longer wants to play a mythological role again on the small screen
 gauratlab he ki is pratibhashali abhinayta ko do bade puranic serial ke nirmaataaon dwaara do alag-alag kirdaaron ke liye poocha gaya tha lekingurmitne yah donon shoj ke ophers ko thukraa diya
 Sources say that Gurmeet was recently asked for the famous mythological character of Ramayana, because it is a new serial in which Vali has an important character
 saath hi,gurmitko mahabharat ke arjuna ke kirdaar ke liye bhi approach kiya gaya tha
 Because of the character of Lord Ram, Gurmeet has reached from house to house and people still know him because of the same character, but then later people are stuck in the same type of character, so Gurmeet has to reject these characters
 Do not regret it
 gurmeet kehete hanki main apane aapako bhaagyashaalee samajhataa hum ki mujhe bhagwaan ram kaa kirdaar nibhaane kaa mauka mila
 Even today, wherever i go, people know me because of this character
 mujhe khushi hai ki aaj bhi meri vah bhoomika logon ne yaad rakhi hai jahaan maine sabase kida puranic kirdaar nibhaayaa hai
 It would be very difficult for people to accept me in another mythological role

 On Monday, the Cabinet of Delhi Government gave the green signal for introduction in the Legislative Assembly, crpc Amendment Bill, Delhi School Education Amendment Bill, Working Journalist Provision Amendment Bill, Delhi Right to Citizens Time Bound Service Delivery Law Amendment and Minimum Wage amendment bill included

 Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal says that his government's hundred days and the Modi government's one-year work should be compared
 kejariwal ne party kaaryakartaaon ke saath google hangout main yah baat kahi
 Kejriwal said, 'on May 24, our government is completing 100 days and on May 26, one year of the Modi government is being completed, then i think the performance of both should be compared to how much we have Worked and how much they did
 ' This thing of the Chief Minister of Delhi is interesting because just before the Delhi elections, when the media talked about Modi vs Kejriwal, Kejriwal and his party people used to say that Modi is the PM, so compare Arvind Kejriwal with bjp's CM candidate Do, because elections are for Delhi and not for the country to jaahir he, ab sawaal ye uthta he ki jab us samay kejariwal piem modi ke saath tulana se manaa karte the to aaj keval dilli main sau din ke kaam kii tulana vah modi ke desh main ek saal ke kaam se kyon karne ko aatur hai? tippaniyan Remember that the Aam Aadmi Party had strongly promoted the 'modi in Kejriwal Desh in Delhi' line in Delhi elections
 beshak, us samay media or bijepi donon hi modi banaam kejariwal muqabla maanakar chal rahi thim, lekin kejariwal or unki party isko nakaarti thi
 In such a situation, what a victory has given Arvind Kejriwal the power to compare the hundred days work of a state government with the work of one year of the central government
 kejariwal ne kaha, '24 may ko hamaari sarkaar ke 100 din puure ho rahe hai or 26 may ko centre kii modi sarkaar kaa ek saal puraa ho rahaa he to mujhe lagata he ki donon ke kaam or is pradarshan kii tulana honi chahie ki hamane kitna kaam kiya or unhone kitna kiya
 ' dilli ke mukhyamantri kii yah baat dilachasp isliye he, kyonki dilli chunaav se thik pehle jab media modi banaam kejariwal kii baat karata tha tab kejariwal or unki party ke log kehete the ki modi piem hai, isliye arvind kejariwal kii tulana bijepi ke siem candidet ke saath karen, kyonki chunaav dilli kaa he desh kaa nahin
 So obviously, now the question arises that when Kejriwal used to refuse comparison with PM Modi at that time, then why is he eager to compare hundred days of work in Delhi only with one year's work in Modi's country? The comments yaad rahe ki aam aadmi party ne dilli chunaav main 'dilli main kejariwal desh main modi' line ko jamkar prachaarit kiya tha
 Of course, at that time both the media and the BJP were following the Modi versus Kejriwal contest, but Kejriwal and his party denied it
 aise main kya ek jeet ne arvind kejariwal ko ek rajya sarkaar ke sau din ke kaam kii tulana centre sarkaar ke ek saal ke kaam se karne kii takat de di he

 The police is investigating the case from different angles
 indore or patna ke rajendra nagar terminal ke bich chalane vaali patna express pukhraayaan ke paas patari se utar gai
 About one hundred and fifty people have died in this accident
 patari se railgadee utarane kii kisi durghatana main itane logon kii maut ho janaa nishchit taur par sabko chaukaata he
 Now the question arises that what happened after that so many people lost their lives in the railway accident
 is rail haadase ke bare main or kuch bataane se pehle ham bataa den ki rail mantri suresh prabhu ne sansad main is par die gaye apane bayaan main kya kaha
 Suresh Prabhu has said to investigate this incident and punish the culprits
 lekin apane bayaan main rail mantri ne is rail haadase main itnaa zyada nuksaan hone ke peeche jo vajah bataai he vah he puraani takanic ke isief coach
 By the way, ICF coaches are based on technology, it is a thing of the past
 railway ko sefti or security ke maamle main suzav dene ke liye bani anil kakodakar cameti kii report main isief coach ko bhartiya railway se puri tarah se hataane kii sifarish kii gai thi
 It has been 4 years since this recommendation, but most of the coaches in the railway are still of ICF technology
 is tarah ke dibbon main bogi ke upar dibba rakhaa hota he
 The connection between the bogie and the compartment is not very strong
 aise main jab aise dibbon se bani hui train patari se utarati he to yah dibbe bogi se alag ho jate hai
 This simply means that the lower part, including the wheels, is separated in the train compartment
 is vajah se in dibbon ke palatney kaa khatra zyada hota he
 In addition to the German technology coaches on many trains, another drawback of these old technology coaches is that their coupling is screw coupling
 is vajah se jab yah dibbe patari se utarate hai to ek duusare ke upar chadh jate hai
 In this process, any two bins rip each other and penetrate to the inside
 aisi sthiti main dibbon main baithe hue yatriyon kaa kachumar nikal jaataa he
 Due to this, the death toll in the accident is very high
 shaayad yahi vajah he kii kakodakar cameti ne in dibbon ko bhartiya railway se puri tarah se hataane kii sifarish kii thi
 But due to lack of budget, only the old technology ICF coaches are being used in most trains in Indian Railways
 is samay deshbhar main takreeban 53 hajaar isief dibbe daud rahe hai
 Indian Railways has started running LHB coaches built on German technology
 deshbhar kii kai trainon main inako lagaaya ja chukaa he
 But there is still a lot of work to do
 
 
 
 This is how the incident happened
 Now we take you to the train accident on Sunday
 jaankaron ke mutabik is rail haadase main 14 dibbe patari se utre, jinamein se kai dibbe ulat-pulat ho gaye or chakanachur ho gaye
 According to Arunendra Kumar, former chairman of the railway board, this incident seems to be due to derailment
 unke mutabik agar aap gaur se puure haadase par najar daudaayen to aap paaenge patari main kisi kharabi kii vajah se railgadee ulti he
 As it appears, the engine of the train is safe
 patari main crek hone kii sthiti main ingine or usase lagi hui kochej teji se aage nikal sakate hai or pichley dibbe is vajah se patariyon se utar sakate hai
 When the engine and the next compartment had overtaken the broken track, the previous compartment derailed
 rail haadase kii tasviren dekhakar sthiti or zyada saaf hoti hai
 It clearly shows that the bogie of the ICF coach was separated and the upper box was separated
 saath hi saath tej gati se chalati hui train main lage hue pichley dibbe jab patari se utre to in dibbon main laga hua air pressure kaa pipe bhi tut gaya, isse dabaav kam hone kii vajah se ingine main automatic brake lag gaye
 According to the railway data, the speed of the train was 107 kilometers per hour at the time when the train accident occurred
 itani speed main achaanak brake lagane se peeche ke kai dibbe uchhalkar aage kii taraf chal die
 In such a case, one box entered
 is vajah se in dibbon main baithe hue logon kaa namonishaan mit gaya
 According to them, according to the driver of Patna Express, there was a noise in running the train and in such a situation, the driver informed about it at Jhansi station but that driver was told that this malfunction would be rectified at some station further
 in sthitiyon main aisa mana ja rahaa he ho saktaa he chalati train kaa excel hi jam ho gaya ho
 If this had happened, then it would come out clearly in the investigation
 lekin jaankaron kaa kahana he ki agar aisa hua bhi to jis tarah kii rail durghatana ho gai he to vah nahin ho paati
 Conspiracy can be behind the accident On the other hand, it is being said that the weather is changing at this time and due to this there is a great difference in the temperature of night and day
 jab aisi sthiti banati he to rail kii patariyon main fracture kii sambhaavna bad jaati he
 To avoid this kind of situation, the railway runs on its gangman tracks so that a fracture can be easily caught in time
 prathamdrishtya aisa dekhne par nahin hua
 a Conspiracy Theory is also under discussion among all of them
 kuch logon kaa maananaa he ki ho naa ho yah kuch logon kii sharaarat kaa nateeja he
 But according to experts, he says that it is too early to reach any conclusion
 rail mantralay ne is maamle kii tah tak jane ke liye ek swatantra jaanch kii ghoshnaa kar di he
 This railway accident will be investigated under the chairmanship of Commissioner Railway Safety

 isamen koi do raay nahin ki 'shamitabh' main unhone ek mjedaar topic ko uthaaya tha
 But it was made a very routine type of film
 is baar bhi aisa hi hua he
 He created the role of role reversal and raised the topic like gender equality
 vishay acha, soch acchhee thi lekin kamjor kahani, kharaab treetment or vishay kaa patari se utar jane ne puri film ke jaayke or uddeshy ko hi bigaad kar rakh diya
 He brought the matter of today's world, but remained entangled in the spider of Bollywood and sat down with a good topic
 film dekhakar aisa laga ki balki ke andar kaa vigyaapan diarector yahaan haaavee rahaa kyonki unhone 30 second ke vigyaapan ke liye to sahi concept chunaa lekin use do ghante kii film main sahi se tabdeel nahin kar sake

 Misunderstandings arise

 Kareena is good
 film kaa mujeec bhi oke he
 The budget of the film is about 30 crores

 The story is also youthful, and also attracts a female audience

Explaining this, senior Congress leader Pramod Tiwari said that the SP had not fielded its candidates in Amethi and Rae Bareli in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections and the Congress had not fielded any candidates from Mainpuri and Kannauj
 tiwari ke mutabik, ''congress ne loksabhaa ke puure paanch saal ke kaarykaal ke dauraan kannauj se ummidavaar na utaarne kaa nirnay kiya tha, jo is upachunaav main bhi lagu he
 a senior party leader, on the condition of anonymity, says that the area of kannauj and Farrukhabad is an area under the influence of senior Congress leader Salman Khurshid and the Congress's influence in the region in the last assembly elections was such that Khurshid's Wife Louise Khurshid also could not save her bail
 congress kaa rajnatik ganit bhi is upachunaav main pratyaashee nahin khadaa karne ko baadhya karata he or aisa kar congress ne mulaayam singh se apni dosti kaa sanket diya he
 The Congress wants to keep Mulayam along with the West Bengal Chief Minister and Trinamool Congress leader Mamata Banerjee from protecting the central government
 yahi nahin, mulaayam ke saath se congress ko aane vaale dinon main hone vaale raashtrapati chunaav main bhi laabh paane kii aas he
 Kannauj is the sp's stronghold for the last 20 years
 akhilesh yadav yahaan se lagaataar teen baar saansad rahe hai or haalia vidhansabha chunaav main kannauj kii sabhi paanch siton par sapa ne apana paracham laharaaya he
 bjp's problem was much heavier than Congress
 usne 5 june ko ghoshnaa kii ki pratyaashee nahin utaara jayega, lekin agle din 6 june ko vah palati maar gai or subah 11 baje jagadev singh yadav kii ummidavaari kii ghoshnaa kar di gai
 But for him, the office of the Kannauj collector proved so far away that he could reach there only an hour after the nomination period was over
 namakan daakhil na kar paane ke peeche jagadev ne sapa ko jimmedaar bataaya
 He said that the SP workers kept him entangled in the matter by stopping him on the way from Lucknow to Kannauj, due to which he could not reach on time
 party ke ek netaa ke mutabik, bhaajapa ke paas kannauj se ladane ke liye pratyaashee hi nahin tha
 a BJP leader from Kannauj says that the party was asked not to provide any financial help to the candidate who went to the by-election
 is vajah se kannauj kaa koi bhi netaa upachunaav ladane kaa icchhuk nahin tha tabhi bhaajapa ko aanan-fanan main bahari ummidavaar kii ghoshnaa kerani padi
 sp's state spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary calls the bjp's nomination of candidates a well thought out strategy
 ve kehete hai, ''namakan khatm hone ke kareeb teen ghante pehle ek ummidavaar parchaa daakhil karne ke liye lakhanu se kannauj ravaanaa hota he
 The nomination form requires many types of information, affidavit and proposer
 itane kam samay main in jaruraton ko puraa kar paanaa sambhav nahin tha
 "the lack of candidates to contest SP in this by-election was not only biting the BJP but also the BSP, the main opposition party in the state
" kannauj upachunaav kii ghoshnaa hone ke baad kisi bhi basapa netaa ne yah chunaav ladane ke liye party ko aavedan nahin kiya tha
 The BSP also decided not to contest the election on the last day of nomination due to the discouragement of local activists towards the election
 basapa ke pradesh adhyaksh swami prasad maury bataate hai ki sapa kii sarkaar banane ke baad se hi puure pradesh main araajaktaa kaa maahaul he
 He says, "sp's national president Mulayam Singh Yadav had said that Akhilesh government should be given six months before evaluating it
 isi samaysima kaa khyaal rakhte hue basapa ne chunaav na ladane kaa faisla kiya he
 "well, even though the major parties have not fielded their candidates against Dimple Yadav, two independent candidates are still in the election after the last date of nomination has passed
" shaayad is ummid main ki sattarudh dal se 'deal' ho jaae or naam waapas lekar raajnneeti na sahi, par kismat chamak jaae
 However, the manner in which the major opposition parties have given Dimple Yadav a walkover by not dropping their candidates in this by-election, Dimple himself would not have foreseen that his second political innings would be launched without any opposition

 At that time, the pair of de Villiers and Stuart Binny was under double pressure
 in donon kaa na sirf tufaani gati se score ko badhanaa tha balki wicket ko bhi bachaakar rakhana tha
 Shane Watson's team's condition was that after 15 overs its score was 71 for 4 wickets

 Cyclone Hudhud passed through the Visakhapatnam coast, uprooting trees and toppling electric poles, while three people died in rain-related incidents
 andhra pradesh ke mukhya sachiv iviar krishna raav ne kaha, hudahud ke prabhaav se teen logon kii maut kii khabar he
 He said that during the cyclone, there are reports of uprooting of trees from 195 to 200 km per hour
 bijli ke khambhe or mobile tower bhi ukhd gaye
 This has affected the power and communication network in the area
 raav ne kaha ki vishakhapattanam, shrikakulam or vijiangaram jilon main logon se gharon main hi rahane ko kaha gaya he or yadi unke makaanon kii deevaaren kamjor hai, to ve chakravaat raahat kendron main ja sakate hai
 Officials said the cyclone which has passed off the Visakhapatnam coast seems to be slowing in the first hour, but people should follow the advisory, as it can be very severe later on
 mukhya sachiv ne bataaya ki prabhavit kshetron main andiaref kii timen tainaat kii gai hai
 On the occasion of the celebration of Vijayadashami, in the address of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat said in his address that a law should be made for the Kiram temple
 bhagwat ke is bayaan par sawaal uthaate hue antarrashtriya hindu parishad ke adhyakshapraveen togadiyane kaha he ki 4 rajyon main or jald hi centre main chunaav najadik aae tab hinduon kii bhavanaaen or bhagwaan ram kii yaad ai
 Why have you kept quiet till now? Pravin Togadia has issued a statement saying that in 1989, the BJP national executive had said that a grand Ram temple would be built by enacting a law when the government comes to Parliament with an absolute majority
 is vaade ke bharose main saikadon hinduon ne praan die, hajaaron jail gaye
 And when the government came to the absolute majority at the Center, the last 4
 5 saal se rambhakton kii aawaaj ko dabaaya gaya
 Togadia claimed that by calling a meeting in Bhopal in 2017, the RSS said that stop talking about the Ram temple law in Parliament
 udupi main november 2017 dharmasansad main anekon santon kii maang ke baavjood ram mandir par kanoon kaa prastaav nahin laayaa gaya, jo pichhali 14 dharmasansadon kii maang ke vipareet tha
 Togadia questioned that when the UP police dragged Sant Paramhansadas, who is fasting for the demand of law on the Ram temple, where were the intellectual intellectuals of today? Togadia has demanded that 4 bring the law to the Ram temple
 5 saalon kii akshamya deree ke liye centre sarkaar, bijepi or unki matrusanghathan aresas ko hinduon se maafee maangani chahie
 At the same time, Togadia has given an ultimatum that before 21 October, the central government enacted an ordinance on the Ram temple in Ayodhya and called a special session of Parliament to enact its law
 gauratlab he ki sangh pramukh mohan bhagwat ne apane sambodhan main kaha tha ki kisi bhi raste se ram mandir kaa nirmaan jarur hona chahie, iske liye sarkaar ko kanoon laana chahie
 He said that people say that they have power, yet why the temple is not built, the voter remains the king of only one day
 And it's a wrap! Goodbye Alauddin
 1 year and a few weeks later, i bid you farewell
 May your restless soul find its peace

 That the Congress is not allowing the Modi government to work against black money

 On Sahitya Aaj Tak, we are presenting an excerpt of his play 'dreams of Tipu Sultan' written in English
 ‘drims of tipu sultan’ vishwa-bhar main charchit hua or anek deshon main rangamanch par ise khelaa gaya
 What to say about India and Pakistan? This drama is particularly popular here
 is naatak main tipu sultan ke jivan ke antim dinon kaa chithran kiya gaya he
 Tipu was the Sultan of Mysore
 use bhartiya itihaas ke pramukh vyaktitvon main sthaan praapt he
 He strongly opposed the British rule in India
 is naatak main uske jivan or bharat ke itihaas kii kuch pramukh ghatnaon ko saakaar kiya gaya he
 Tipu Sultan was born in 1753
 apane pita haidar ali kii mrityu ke baad 7 disambar, 1782 ko vah mysore kaa shaasha bana
 He was well educated, educated, well-known Persian and a writer
 uske patr or tippaniyan aaj bhi uplabdh hai
 The importance of the books included in his self-study can be gauged from the fact that after his death in the war on 4 May 1799, his vast library was taken to England, which is still a part of the Cambridge, Oxford and India Office Library of London 
 tipu sultan ne apane jivan kaa zyaadaatar samay jang ke maidan main ghode kii peeth par bitaayaa
 But during this time, very few people know about Tipu that he used to dream a lot, which few people around him knew about
 puure jivan uske sapanom ke bare main kisi ko pataa nahin chalaa, par uske aakhri dinon main is raaj se pardaa uth gaya
 Tipu was not just a warrior, he was also a visionary politician, which we get an idea from this inspiring drama

 It has been claimed in a study

 40% of these women believed that they treated their children like their mother
 ve is umr main apane saathi ke saath isi lahaze main baatcheet karne kii baat sweekaar karti hai

 pichley kuch maheenon se lagaataar desh main privesi ko lekar dibet hoti rahi hai
 Privacy was not a fundamental right in the court on behalf of the government
 ab supreme court ne is maamle par apana faisla suna diya he or ab yah Article 21 ke tahat moulik adhikaar ke andar hi mana jayega
 After this decision, the government may have some difficulty, because the experts have been considering Aadhaar as a breach of privacy
 aadhaar ke khilaaf yachika daayar kii jaati rahi he
 It was argued by the government that in the digital world people give their information to third party websites such as Facebook and Google
 supreme court ke is faisle ke baad ab kai maamle or bhi hanginepar dhyaan diya janaa behad jaruri he
 Privacy is not fully defined as an example
 isse pehle kai faisle aae hai jinamein privesi ko paribhaashit karnaa mushkil mana gaya he
 So even after this decision, what will be the difference between Section 377, Section 66A and Aadhaar, it is difficult to say at the moment
 purv grih mantri pi
 Chidambaram has said, 'it is not a big issue to give information to build the base
 kyonki idantity ke liye sarkaar aisi jaankariyaan rakh sakati he
 The biggest issue was that Aadhaar is being made mandatory for other essential services
 yahaan tak kii aane vaale samay main mobile number lene yaa railway tikat ke liye bhi aadhaar kii jarut hogi
 This is the biggest problem why Aadhaar details should be given to a private company
 'aadhaar ke alaava kai duusare maamle bhi hai jisase sarkaar mushkil main aa sakati he
 Among them is Article 377 under which homosexuality is considered a crime
 iske alaava IT act kaa Section 66A he jiske tahat agar koi shaks apane soshal media acount se apni soch rakhata he or sarkaar ko usamen kuch galat dikhataa he to us shaks ke khilaaf acshan liya ja saktaa he
 Article 377 and IT Act Section 66A will also have an impact In addition to the basis, Article 377 and Section 66A are two such Acts which may have an impact on the decision of the Supreme Court
 chunki ab niztaa moulik adhikaar he isliye sarkaar kisi shaks ke personal acount se jaankariyaan nahin le sakati he
 Generally, the government and government agencies have the right to breach a person's personal account
 philhal supreme court ke faisle main aadhaar par koi tippanee nahin kii gai he, lekin aane vaale samay main sarkaar ke ruukh ke baad hi saaf hoga ki aadhaar ko anivaary kahaan kiya jayega
 Recently there have been reports of data leakage of the cost base
 lekin logon ke man main sawaal the ki wo data li hone par kya karen? mukadmaa kiske khilaaf karen? kisase shikayaat karen? ab supreme court ke is faisle ke baad jawaab mil gaya he
 Since the information given to form Aadhaar is private and after this decision of the Supreme Court, privacy is a fundamental right
 aise main data li ho gaya to is par sarkaar kii javabdehi badhati he jinka data li hua he wo iske khilaaf le sakate hai
 Although there were laws before this, but now they will become experimental
 sarkaar par security badhaane kaa dabaaghbhi tak to sarkari websites se aadhaar ke data likaote rahe or iske khilaaf na to kai mukademahua or na hi koi samaj paaya ki karnaa kya he
 But after this decision of the Supreme Court, if there is any kind of user date leaked, not only Aadhaar, then it can become a problem for the government
 isliye sarkari websites ko majboot karne kii kii jarurat he
 Difficulties of whatsapp and Facebook can be reduced before this, information has been sought from whatsapp and Facebook
 har saal sarkaar fasebuk se neshnal security ke liye yujar data maangati he
 Not only this, there have been constant questions on whatsapp that people can avoid doing wrong due to its privacy policy
 kyonki whatsap kii and tu and ancripshan kisi bhi sarkari agency ko iskaa data lene se rokatii he
 In such a situation, after this decision, pressure can not be made to give user data on platforms like whatsapp and Facebook

 The Uttarakhand government has received a setback from the Supreme Court over the decision to disqualify nomination of candidates with more than two children in the panchayat elections
 uttarakhand sarkaar ke faisle par uttarakhand hai court ke ste aadesh par roak lagane se supreme court ne inkaar kar diya
 The court said that the court will not interfere in the election to be held on October 5
 iske saath hi supreme court ne hoicourt main yachikakarta rahe pakshakaron ko bhi notice jari kiya
 In the case of the High Court quashing the Panchayati Raj Amendment Act disqualifying candidates with more than two children in the panchayat elections, the Uttarakhand government said that it would not be in the national interest that candidates having more than two children contest the election
 sarkaar ne uttarakhand hai court ke faisle ko supreme court main chunauti di thi
 The Uttarakhand High Court had clarified that the cut off date for implementing this amendment would be 25 July 2019
 matlab is taarikh ke baad do se adhik bachche vaale pratyaashee panchayat chunaav ladane ke ayogy maane jaaenge, jabaki 25 july 2019 se pehle jiske teen bachche hai, vah chunaav lard sakate hai

 1 date usually means salary, filled with pocket notes
 lekin 1 june yani somvaar ko aapaki jeb baari nahin halki hogi
 This is because you are going to get a shock of inflation
 1 june se sarvice tex 12
 Will increase from 36 percent to 14 percent
 yani har sarvice par aapkaa bill lagbhag 1
 Will increase by 6 percent
 sunne main dedh fisadi kii ye badhotaree maamuli lag sakati he lekin mushkil yah he kiservice tex kaa yah dimkajagah-jagah aapke gharelu bajet ko chat karata rahegaa
 Let us know where your pocket is going to be light: - If you hire a travel agent for the holiday program, then you have to pay more money to him
 - chuttee kaa kaarykram banane ke liye agar aap doston se phone par baat karte hai to phone ke bill par bhibadha hua tex lagegaa
 - Whether traveling by airplane or in the AC coach compartment, you will not be able to avoid the service tax
 - hotel main ruknaa ho yaa restraan main khaanaa khaanaa, sab kuch mahangaa hoga
 However, it is also a matter of knowing that after 14% service tax, now you do not have to pay education cess or any other cess on it
 ganimat yah he ki skool ajukeshan fees, aspataal main ilaaj jaisi kuch chuninda sevaayen is daayre se baahar hai
 You can estimate how much the service tax will hit, in this way: - After the exemption of abatement, in some services, service tax is levied on only a part of the entire bill
 yani aapako puure bill par sarvice tex nahin dena he
 For example, on the food bill in the restaurant, you have not 14 but 5
 6 fisadi sarvice taxdena hoga
 - On telephone bill of 100 rupees, you have to pay 106 rupees, while the society charges two thousand, then you have to pay 2032 rupees
 - first class yaa asi class main safar karne vaale rail yatriyon ko sarvice tex kii garmi lagegi
 Here also the total passenger fare 4
 2 fisadi kaa ijapha hoga
 But already 3
 7 fisadi sarvice tex lagata aa rahaa he, lihaaja hajaar rupee ke tikat par lagbhag paanch rupee zyada adaa karne honge
 The common people may be troubled by the weight of this service tax, but in the eyes of economists, this arrangement will have far-reaching consequences
 saath hi guds and sarvice tex yani jiesti kii ore yah bada kadam hoga
 Because the GST shock will be strong, this arrangement will cause a loud shock

 bihar chunaav se ain pehle shatrughna sinha ne endie ke sahyogi lojpa ke pramukh ramvilas paswan ko bihar ke CM pad kaa sabase yogya ummidavaar bataa daalaa he
 Let's look at five possible reasons that Shatrughan Sinha threw out Ram Vilas Paswan's name: -1
 jatigat sameekaranbihar vidhaan parishad chunaavon main jeet se utsahit bhaajapa jatigat samikarnon ko saadh kar vidhansabha chunaav main utarana chaahati he
 The biggest emphasis is on 29 percent EBC voters, which have been the strongest base of lalu-nitish
 bhaajapa kii ranneeti paswan ko aage kar vipaksh ke isi aadhaar ko dhwast karne kii he
 2
 party kaa cheharaabihar main rajya str par bhaajapa ke paas susheel modi ke alaava koi bada cheharaa nahin he or susheel modi sabhi virgon main sweekaarya nahin lag rahe hai
 In such a situation, the BJP can also bet on any leader of the allies
 is sthiti main ramvilas paswan se behatar vikalp uske paas shaayad hi koi or ho
 3
 lalu-nitish ko chunautinithish-lalu-congress or vamadalon ke mahagathbandhan ke jariye pichhadon kii raajnneeti karne kii koshish main hai
 In such a situation, the forwarding of Ram Vilas by the NDA can be a part of the bjp's big strategy to unite the backward and backward
 4
 The trump card can prove to be a trump card for the NDA, Ram Vilas Paswan coming from the backward caste
 ramkripal yadav ko apane paale main laa chuki bhaajapa ko lalu yadav ke front par nahin rahane kaa phayda ho saktaa he
 In such a situation, Ram Vilas can be a guarantee of Dalit votes
 5
 Lagamsatrughna Sinha's statement on Jitan Ram Manjhi may also be part of the party's strategy to project Paswan as a big Dalit leader in front of nda-linked Jitan Ram Manjhi
 pichley kuch samay se maanjhi dalit voton ke apane paksh main hone kaa daawa karte rahe hai

 rajdhani main ye vahi mudda he jis par congress ko kejariwal ne gherkar dilli kii satta hasil kii lekin ab congress kejariwal ko isi mudde par gharene lagi he
 According to Delhi Congress President Sheila Dixit, the fixed charge of electricity, which was increased by the Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission (DERC) in March last year, benefited the power companies by about 7 thousand crores
 congress maang kar rahi he ki dilli sarkaar ne jo bijli companiyon ko phayda pahunchaaya he, usko dilli kii janata ko rifund kiya jaae
 Kejriwal did not give the time to meet on Monday, on the matter of power, Sheila Dikshit, who was the Chief Minister of Delhi for 15 years, demanded the time to meet Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday
 jiske liye baqayda dilli congress kii ore se ravivaar ko kol kiya gaya, lekin mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne somvaar ko milane kaa vakt nahin diya
 According to Aaron Yusuf, working president of Delhi Congress, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal is misleading the people of Delhi on the issue of electricity
 kejariwal par bijli companiyon ko phayda pahunchane kaa aaropaarun yusuf ne kaha ki bijli ke mudde par congress mukhyamantri kejariwal se mulaakaat karnaa chaahati he, lekin dilli ke mukhyamantri baatcheet se bachate najar aa rahe hai
 Although Congress Working President Aaron Yusuf said that time was sought on Monday but Arvind Kejriwal has given time to meet on Wednesday
 congress kaa maananaa he ki somvaar nahin to buudhvaar sahi dilli kii janata ke hit main mukhyamantri se mulaakaat karenge
 Also, the power companies which have been benefited under the cover of fix charge in Delhi, will demand a refund
 congress netaa haaron yusuf kaa kahana he ki ek saal biit jane ke baad dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ko bade hue phixd charge kam karne kii yaad ai he
 When elections have come to the fore in Delhi
 haaron yusuf kaa kahana he jo 7000 karod kaa phayda bijli companiyon kaa hua he us par dilli kii janata kaa agle 6 maheene tak kaa bijli kaa bill maaf kiya jaae
 On the other hand, power expert VS Vohra says that the price of electricity raised by DERC in Delhi last year has hit 3 to 4 times of Delhi's 48 lakh consumers
 vahiin bijli companiyon ko lagbhag 5 se 7 hajaar karod kaa phayda hua he
 On the other hand, the companies providing electricity in Delhi say that they are losing money
 bijli companiyon kii report ke mutabik bijli company bisies ko 64 karod, biwipiel ko 100 karod ore andipiel ko 124 karod kaa nuksaan ho rahaa he
 Let me tell you that last year DERC which fixes electricity rates in Delhi
 usne dilli main fiks charge kaa ijapha kiya tha
 The fixed charge rates in Delhi are now 0 to 2 kw 20 Rs 125 Rs 2 to 5 kw 35 Rs 140 Rs 5 to 15 kw 45 Rs 175 Rs 15 to 25 kw 60 Rs 200 Rs 25 kw 100 Rs 250 These are the fixed charges of electricity which were increased by DERC last year
 jisko lekar ke dilli kii janata ne sawaal uthaae the ki dilli main bijli kii dar logon kii jeb par asar daal rahi he
 But the Delhi government was seen repeatedly saying that electricity prices are the lowest in Delhi
 barhaal, bijli ke mudde par congress or aam aadmi party ab aamane-saamne hai
 Now it has to be seen whether the Congress is really able to get the Aam Aadmi Party worried about the issue of electricity in the coming elections
