 Voting for the third phase of the assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh has been completed
 chauthe charan ke liye chunavi maidan main utrin partiyaan jor-shor se prachaar juty hai
 While the BJP is not leaving any chance for an attack on the sp-congress alliance, rahul-akhilesh is also not delaying the decision
 lekin chunaav se pehle bijepi ke khilaaf or akhilesh kaa saath dene kaa dam bharne vaali partiyaan najar nahin aa rahi hai
 Although it is reported that Lalu will campaign for the sp-congress alliance on Tuesday and Wednesday, but why the initial three phases did not appear is a big question
 notebandi ke vakt centre ke khilaaf morchadarasal 8 november 2016 kii raat 8 baje jaise hi desh ko sambodhit karte hue pradhanmantri narendra modi ne notebandi ke faisle kaa elaan kiya, vipaksh ekajute ho gaya
 All parties except JDU opened a front against the central government and PM Modi
 partiyon ne notebandi ke faisle ko galat bataate hue sarkaar ke khilaaf sadak se lekar sansad tak apana virodh jataayaa
 West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav were at the forefront
 
 
 
 What happened to your promise? These people had decided to teach BJP a lesson in UP elections at that time
 mamata or lalu ne yahaan tak kah diya tha ki wo upi chunaav main bijepi ke khilaaf or akhilesh ke samarthan main prachaar karenge, jabaki kejariwal kehete the ki wo sabhaayen kar bijepi kii haar sunishchit karenge, or centre sarkaar kii tamamgalat nitiyonke bare main upi kii janata ko bataaenge
 Perhaps, the BJP was also intimidated by his threat
 lekin upi main teen charan ke matdaan ho chuke hai
 BJP is trying to justify the decision of demonetisation in every assembly
 lekin akhilesh ko saath dene kaa vaada karne vaale ye chehre upi main kahin bhi chunavi manch par najar nahin aa rahe hai
 Had promised to ask for votes in support of Akhilesh, if talking about Mamata Banerjee, he had added the decision of demonetisation against the people and said that the poor people are troubled by this, and the talk about black money is only air
 unhone is faisle ke liye kolkata se lekar patna, lakhanu or dilli main sabhaayen kii thim
 In all the meetings, Mamata said in a threatening manner, 'she will appeal to the voters in UP to vote against the BJP and Modi ji in favor of Akhilesh'
 upi main kahin najar nahin aa rahi hai didigauratlab he ki notebandi ke khilaaf lakhanu sabha main mamata ne akhilesh ko shaamil hone ke liye aamantrit kiya tha
 Although Akhilesh Khud himself did not reach, but a minister of the party was definitely sent
 lekin ab jab upi main chunavi sargarmi charam par he, teen charnon kii voting bhi ho chuki he, lekin didi kahin bhi akhilesh ke saath manch par najar nahin aa rahi hai, or shaayad aage bhi nahin aane vaali hai
 Because as of now there is no news about his presence in the UP election campaign
 ab isaki vajah kya he ye to didi yaa phir akhilesh hi bataa sakate hai
 When will Lalu play the relationship? During demonetisation, Lalu had also opened a strong front against the Center, and also promised to seek votes for Akhilesh in UP
 vaisellaluto mulaayam ke rishtedaar bhi hai, logon kii ummid thi ki lalu jarur akhilesh or haath ke paksh main maahaul banane ke liye chunavi manch par najar aaenge
 Let me tell you that when there was a war in the Mulayam family about 'bicycle', Lalu had also tried a lot for reconciliation
 unhone mulaayam ko yahaan tak salaah di thi ki wo akhilesh ko 'cycle' saunp den
 Election stage without Lalu, now when Akhilesh has got a bicycle and is convincing him to run again in UP, then Lalu is not seen with him
 vaise to lalu ke bete congress ke saath milakar bihar main sarkaar chalaa rahe hai
 But so far Lalu is missing from the electoral stage of UP
 upi main chunaav kii tarikhon kaa elaan hote hi khud lalu ne akhilesh ke liye prachaar karne kii baat kahi thi
 However, there are reports that Lalu will seek votes for the sp-congress alliance on Tuesday and Wednesday
 kejariwal bhi bhuule gaye vaadenotbandi ke khilaaf raajnneeti main teesraa sabase bada cheharaa arvind kejariwal kaa tha
 Even now there is talk of increasing black money from vagotabandi
 unhone punjab-goa main to bijepi se khub loha liya
 But the Aam Aadmi Party as well as their leaders are far from the politics of UP
 notebandi ke dauraan kejariwal-mamata ne to dilli ke ajadpur main ek sabha ke dauraan kaha tha ki wo donon upi main piem modi ke khilaaf prachaar karenge
 He had told that my only agenda to hold public meeting would be to tell the conspiracy behind demonetisation
 kejariwal ne yahaan tak kaha tha ki wo jagah-jagah sabhaayen karke logon se bijepi ko vot nahin karne kii apil karenge
 But despite being in Delhi, Kejriwal does not appear to be in the fray against BJP anywhere in UP
 haalanki soshal media par wo bijepi ke khilaaf lagaataar caments kar rahe hai
 Was there a front against BJP? The way Mamata, Lalu and Kejriwal have distanced themselves from the UP election campaign
 isse to yahi lagata he ki notebandi ko lekar bijepi ke khilaaf inkaa naaraa keval dikhaava tha, kyonki agar ye sabhi raajnneeti ke bade khilaadi upi ke manch par akhilesh ke saath yaa phir piem modi ke khilaaf khadey hote to shaayad bijepi ko mukaable ke liye ranneeti badalani padati
 Or it may be that these leaders have now put the decision in abeyance at the time of demonetisation
 yani chunavi maidan par akhilesh ko aage bhi akele hi bijepi ke khilaaf ladaai ladani hogi

 afjal guru ko achaanak faansee par latakaae jane se sadame main aayaa uskaa parivaar supreme court main dastak dene kii yojana bana rahaa he taaki koi or parivaar apane ajij kii maut se pehle usase mulaakaat se maharoom na rahe
 Aizaz Guru, elder brother of Afzal Guru, who was convicted for the attack on the Parliament that was hanged on February 9, says, "we cannot bring Afzal back, who has got such a heartless death
" adhikari bedard the or unhone aakhri vakt bhi afjal ko uske parivaar se milane kii ijaajat nahin di, lekin ham shaayad yah bandobast kar sakate hai ki koi or parivaar is sadame se na gujarey
 Afzal's wife, son and the rest of the family were not informed in advance about his execution
 unhen khabar ke saarvajanik hone par is bare main pataa chalaa
 The letter sent by the officials of Delhi's Tihar Jail to inform him reached Afzal about 51 hours after he was hanged
 isse kashmir ghati main gusse kii lahar daud gai
 The comments parivaar ne bharat ke mukhya nyaayadhish altamas kabir kii us tippanee se is disha main aage badhane kaa faisla kiya, jisamen unhone kaha tha ki maut kii sajaa paae logon ke parijan ko unki faansee ke bare main pehle se suchit kiya janaa chahie
 He said
 
 The principle is that the family should always be informed at that time when things are going to happen
 ’’ afjal ko faansee die jane ke tareeke par jab vivaad apane charam par tha to pataa chalaa he ki pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne grih mantri susheel kumaar scindia ko bulaayaa or faansee ke bare main parivaar ko suchit karne main hui deree par nakhushi jaahir kii
 Afzal's family wants the Supreme Court to take suo motu cognizance of the matter and make a rule that the families of those who are to be hanged should be informed in advance and allowed to meet before hanging
 9 farvari ko faansee par latakaae gaye sansad par hamale ke doshi afjal guru ke bade bhai aijaj guru kehete hai, ham afjal ko to waapas nahin laa sakate, jise is kadar beraham maut mili
 The officers were unrelenting and did not allow Afzal to meet his family even at the last moment, but we can probably make sure that no other family goes through this shock
 afjal kii patni, putr or parivaar ke baaki logon ko uski faansee ke bare main pehle se suchit nahin kiya gaya
 He came to know about this when the news was made public
 dilli ke tihaad jail ke adhikariyon ne unhen suchit karne ke liye jo patr bheja tha vah afjal ko faansee par latakaae jane ke kareeb 51 ghante ke baad un tak pahunchaa
 This triggered a wave of anger in the Kashmir Valley
 tippaniyan The family decided to move in this direction with the remarks of Chief Justice of India Altamas Kabir, in which he said that the family of those sentenced to death should be informed in advance about their execution

 desh menyon utpeedanke khilaaf chal rahi soshal media campan # metoo ke tahat videsh rajyamantriemje akbarpar kai mahila patrakaron ne aarope lagaae hai
 The women say that while being a journalist, MJ Akbar has harassed them
 haalanki lambey intjaar ke baad in aaropon par akbar ne safai di he or sabhi aaropon kaa bebuniyaad or jhootha bataaya he
 The Minister of State for External Affairs, who was earlier an editor in several media houses, has not only rejected the allegations of women journalists but has even threatened legal action against the women who made the allegations
 videsh daure se lautate hi akbar ne bayaan jari kar kaha ki in aaropon se meri chhavi kharaab karne kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 Why women were silent till now MJ Akbar has also questioned the allegations after 20 years
 unhone kaha ki kai mahilaon ne to 20 saal puraani baton kaa zikr kiya he wo mahilaayein ab tak kyon chup thim
 i have worked with many women even after the allegations of harassment have been made, why no one has said anything
 kisi ne abtak shikaayat kyon nahin karai, uski ek hi vajah he ki maine aisa kuch bhi nahin kiya he
 Akbar said why all these allegations are being made even before the 2019 elections
 kya ye koi agenda he, yah aapako tay karnaa he
 These allegations are trying to tarnish my image before the election
 congress ne aaropon kii timming par akbar kii ore se uthaae gaye sawaalon par kaha ki akbar koun se janaadhar vaale netaa hai or ek rajaneta ke taur par unki chhavi kuch bhi nahin he
 Congress spokesperson Tom Vadakkan said that there is no political conspiracy behind the allegations against Akbar and it would be costly if the BJP does not exclude from the same cabinet
 party pravaktaa ne kaha ki akbar par lage aaropon se kisi bhi raajnneetik dal ko kya phayda ho saktaa he
 This is the issue of women and they have raised their voice
 akbar par aaropon kii jadeebataa den ki videsh se lautne par videsh rajyamantri emje akbar ne kaha tha ki apane upar lage aaropon par ve baad main bolenge
 Apart from this, on October 12, when Amit Shah was asked a question on this issue, he had said that it would have to be seen whether these allegations were true or false
 amit shah ne kaha tha ki post kii satyata jaanch bhi jaruri he, jinaki ore se ye aarope lagaaye gayi hai
 MJ Akbar, a famous journalist and writer, has been the editor of many newspapers
 unke upar ab tak 11 mahila patrakaron ne # metoo campan ke tahat aarope lagaae hai
 Akbar was first accused by a senior journalist named Priya Ramani in which he told his story during an interview in a hotel room
 ramani ke aaropon ke baad akbar ke khilaaf aaropon kii baadh aa gai or ek ke baad ek kai anya mahila patrakaron ne un par sangeen aarope laga rahi hai

 Shocking the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Supreme Court refused to allow the party's rath yatra in West Bengal
 mangalvaar ko court ne kaha he ki is rathyatra ko lekar rajya sarkaar kii taraf se khadey kiye gaye sawaal niraadhaar nahin hai
 Therefore, BJP should send a proposal of a fresh program for its meetings and rallies to the state government
 vahiin court ne rajya sarkaar ko kaha he ki bijepi ke nae prastaav par sanvaidhanik praavdhaan ko dhyaan main rakhte hue faisla le taaki raajnneetik dal kaa moulik adhikaar prabhavit na ho
 The apex court said on behalf of the West Bengal government that according to the police and intelligence information, the law and order could be a problem due to the bjp's rath yatra in the state
 lekin sarkaar ko party kii choti-badi sabha se koi pareshaani nahin he
 The BJP on the other hand said that a 40-day program was proposed in the rath yatra, but the party has cut it in view of the state government's stand
 gauratlab he ki disambar main bijepi kii pradesh ikai pashchim bengal main rathyatra nikaalane vaali thi, is yatra main party ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ke shaamil hone ke saath-saath uttar pradesh mukhyamantri yogi adityanath bhi shaamil hone vaale the
 But the state government banned the visit citing law and order
 jiske baad bijepi ne rajya sarkaar ke faisle ke khilaaf hoicourt main apil kii
 The single bench of the High Court approved the rath yatra to the BJP, but the division bench stayed the rath yatra
 iske baad bijepi ne hoicourt ke faisle ko supreme court main chunauti di
 But now the Supreme Court has also refused to give relief to the BJP, keeping the High Court's decision

 lekin rajya sarkaar or hoicourt se ijaajat na milane ke kaaran rathyatra nahin nikal pai

 a post shared by xxrep 12 ⠀ Ram Charan (@ramcharan_) on Jan 15, 2018 at 6:46am PST It may seem strange to hear this, but even today, there is a village in the National Capital Region (NCR) from where the polling booth is 90 km away
 gaanv main kareeb 50-60 ghar hai or aabaadi kareeb 300 kii, jinamein se 160 voter hai
 The way to Dalelpur of Greater Noida is via Faridabad
 dilli ke kalindi kunj se kareeb 50 kilometre dur
 If the people of this village go to vote, then first they have to go through Faridabad
 
 Then Delhi, followed by Noida and then Greater Noida as the last stop
 dalelpur gaanv kaa poling booth gulavali main he, jo yamuna express-ve se sata he
 There is another way to reach the polling booth, which is risky
 iske liye gaanv ke logon ko yamuna nadi langhni padati he
 This may be a shortcut route, but to reach the Yamuna coast, the villagers first have to march three kilometers on foot, then the boat is supported and after crossing it, they have to walk five kilometers once again
 gaanv kaa vajood desh ke pehle aam chunaav yani 1952 ke samay se he
 Earlier this village was in Faridabad
 1982 ke baad se greater noida kaa hissaa he
 In 1982, the district Gautam Budh Nagar and Haryana were demarcated, after which this village was included in Gautam Budh Nagar
 ab tak vikaas ko tarasate is gaanv kii bijli faridabad ke hi bharose he
 Roads are in bad shape and for basic needs like health and education, these people have to see the face of Faridabad
 gaanv vaale bataate hai ki chunaav ke samay bhi ummidavaar nahin, bas unke numaayinde hi yahaan pahunchate hai
 Nevertheless, their courage to vote is worth watching
 jokhim hone ke baavjood ye matdaan karnaa nahin bhoolatey

 The third ODI of the series is being played between India and New Zealand at the JSCA International Stadium in Ranchi
 ranchi main pehali baar ye donon timen aapas main bhid rahi hai
 Earlier, both these teams have played three matches in this series, in which India is ahead 2-1
 donon tiimon ke bich is ahm mukaable ko jeet kar jahaan newjiland siries main barabari karnaa chahega vahiin team india aaj kii jeet ke saath hi siries ko sil karnaa chaahegi
 Let us tell you what are the five reasons despite the efforts of the Kiwi team, due to which Team India is a strong contender to win in Ranchi
 1
 Team India has been invincible in Ranchi Till now, three international odis have been played at JSCA International Stadium in Ranchi and Team India has never lost here
 england ke khilaaf 19 janvari 2013 ko dhoni kii captaini main 7 wicket se to 16 november 2014 ko viraat kii captaini main srilanka ke khilaaf teen wicket se jeet mili
 Whereas the ODI played against Australia on 23 October 2013 was inconclusive due to rain
 2
 Kohli is the lion of Dhoni's den, home of Ranchi ODI captain Dhoni, but here he has scored only 10 runs
 jabaki test captain viraat kohli yahaan shatak ke saath hi ardhashatak bhi jad chuke hai
 In one of the three matches before today, Virat did not get a chance to bat and in two he scored 77 and 139
 viraat ke naam ab tak ranchi main 216 ran hai or yahaan unase zyada ran banane vaala koi cricketer nahin hai
 The special thing is that in both these innings, Virat was not out
 ek baar phir viraat apane shandaar form main hai or unase phir ek badi pari kii ummid bhi he
 3
 pehali baar garajega dhoni kaa ballaranchi main do saal baad vanade khelaa ja rahaa he or sambhawatah mahendra singh dhoni apni captaini main yahaan aakhri baar khel rahe hai
 In the last match, captain Dhoni came to bat first, taking responsibility on his shoulders and after a long time his fans got to see Dhoni's great innings
 ek saal ke baad dhoni ke balle se ardhashatak niklaa
 During his 80 runs, Dhoni surpassed Sachin Tendulkar in odis and became the most sixes Indian cricketer
 is siries ke pehle teen vanade maichon main dhoni 21, 39 or 80 ranon kii paariyaan khel chuke hai
 In such a situation, it is not meaningless to expect his bat to roar once again on his own land
 4
 It will be known at the time of the landing of batting that Team India has chased the total of the opposition team so far in Target
 yani ballebaaji baad main kii he
 In today's match against New Zealand, India is also fielding first
 matlab saaf he, baad main fielding ke dauraan newjiland ke liye bowling aasaan nahin hogi kyonki os apana karaamaat jarur dikhaaegi or yah baat bhartiya team ko bakhubi pataa he
 New Zealand descending to bat first after winning the toss can prove to be a Diwali gift as Team India will know the target of victory and Ranchi has the winning record of the team batting later
 pehle batting karne vaali team ab tak yahaan ek bhi muqabla nahin jeet saki he
 5
 23 jeet ke saath bharat kaa palada he baarikotla main bharat ko haraane ke baavjood bharat main newjiland kii team kaa vanade record kuch khaas nahin rahaa he
 While the overall score in the overall ODI record between these two teams is heavy with a difference of very few matches, these records show the Kiwi team on Indian soil very weak
 in donon tiimon ke bich jahaan ab tak kul 96 vanade match khele gaye hai
 The Indian team has a record of 48 wins and 42 defeats in these matches
 overol maamla behad kareebi he lekin bharat main khele gaye 30 muqablon main se kiwi team keval 6 jeet saki he jabaki bharat 23 jeet ke saath koson aage he
 That is, all five factors are advocating for the victory of Team India today, but in such a situation, it should not be forgotten that any one mistake made by Dhoni's army can once again give Kiwis an unexpected victory like Kotla

 kala ke kshetra main 2010 main padam bhushan or 1972 main padmashri sammaanon se navaaje ja chuke ramkumar kii teen beshkeemtee paintings unke hi ghar se chori chali gayi
 Ramkumar's son says that these paintings belong to the Sad Town series, which were made between 1955 and 1960
 preet vihaar ilaake kii artist colony main rahane vaale ramkumar ke mutabik ghar ke basament main rakhi ye paintings kareeb 10 karod rupee kii thim
 He has also received the Lalit Kala Akademi Award and a painting of the same series was sold in London for around four crores
 vahiin, desh ke bade chitrakaaron kaa maananaa he ki kuch khaas maapdand paintings kii keemat tay karte hai or ramkumar kaa isamen koi jabaab nahin he
 Mumbai painter Kamalakant says that the historical value of any painting is valued by its depth in art, its age and the painter's rank
 yadi kalakaar kii maut ho gai ho to uski painting kii keemat or bad jaati he
 Delhi Police has registered an FIR for theft at Preet Vihar police station on Ramkumar's complaint and investigation is on
 lekin, sawaal sirf paise yaa paintings kaa nahin kisi kalakaar kii puunji kaa he
 The government in Pakistan may belong to anyone, but its chief guest does not change
 sarkaar main aane se pehle naepakistanki baat karne vaale imran khan bhi apane mulk kii ravaayat ke mutabik ab usee dharre par chal pade hai
 The world is looking for the ten million dollar terrorist terrorist Hafiz Saeed, he is mocking the world by becoming the Chief Guest of the Government of Pakistan
 jo sudhar jaae wo paak nahinjo sudhar jaae use haafiz said nahin kehete
 The one who bowed down to the army and the ISI is not called a captain
 or jo badal jaae use pakistan nahin kehete
 Just two months
 faqat do maheene lage or iske saath hi pakistan kii nai sarkaar or nae captain kaa cheharaa aam ho gaya
 It became clear that no matter who the government is in Pakistan, whoever is the head of the government, the terrorists will get hold of the power chair
 aatanki kii aav-bhagatapuri duniya jaanati he ki ye das milian america dollar kaa inami aatankwaadi he
 The world is looking for it
 par ye he ki pakistan main baqayada chif guest ban kar saream naa sirf manch par maujuud he, balki isaki aav-bhagat ke liye pakistan sarkaar bhi bichhi ja rahi he
 Seeing this view, Imran Khan could not believe that he had said something similar recently
 imran khan ne chunaav se pehle aatank se ladane kii baat kahi thi
 See the difference in Pakistan's statement of words, with whom is Imran Khan's minister claiming to fight terrorism
 aap sun sakate hai or aap dekh sakate hai
 There is nothing new in that
 pakistan hameshaa se hi wo mulk rahaa he, jo kahata kuch or karata kuch he
 Look at the way the new Pakistan captain talking about terrorism is walking shoulder to shoulder with terrorism
 bharat ke saath ek nai shuruuaat ke liye kadam se kadam milaane kaa dikhaava karne vaale imran khan ke mantri hindustan ke bare main juda raay rakhte hai
 Imran's trick or helplessness, Imran used to say that we will build a new Pakistan
 bharat-paak ke rishton main garmaahat laaenge
 But they did not come even for eight days and they have started showing their colors
 hafiz said ke saath imran sarkaar ke cabinet mantri kaa ek manch par aana imran kii chaal he yaa majaburi
 After being silenced for a few months due to poisoning against the PM, Hafiz Saeedne, the mastermind of the Mumbai attacks, opened fire when he opened fire against Prime Minister Modi besides India
 usne kaha ki acha hua modi bhrashtachar ke maamle main funs gaye
 Imran's minister made this meeting of politics and terror in Kosapakistan in Islamabad
 jahaan avam ko bharat ke khilaaf ekajute karne ke liye ek sarvadaleey baithak hui
 Due to which, besides the minister of the government, other party leaders and terrorists were also involved
 ye jaanate hue ki hafiz said ko america ne global terrarist ghoshit kar rakhaa he
 Despite this, these meetings were not open but intelligence
 isamen imran sarkaar main dharmik maamalon ke mantri nur-ul-haq kadri naa sirf shariq hue balki hafiz said ke bagal main baithkar usase bhi ek kadam aage nikal gaye or hindustan ko koste nazar aae
 On the stage with the terrorist, the minister of the Imran government attended the event, not only did Hafiz Saeed attend it, but he was the chief guest in the program
 magar sawaal ye ki ek taraf to imran khan party kii saaf suthri image pesh karte hai to vahiin duusari taraf unke mantri hafiz said jaise aatanki ke saath manch saajha kyon kar rahe hai
 So the answer to this question is related to elections
 sab jaanate hai ki imran ko pradhanmantri banane main sena ke saath saath aatank ke is aakaa kaa bhi utana hi role rahaa he
 Now that Imran Khan has become the Prime Minister, he is paying the debt of Hafiz
 aatanki ke sanghathan ko sarkari madadbaat sirf manch saajha karne tak mahadood nahin he balki pakistan kii satta sanbhaalane ke baad imran khan ne aatanki hafiz said ke sanghathan kimdadkarani bhi shuru kar di he
 Pakistan's Supreme Court has ruled a major relief for Hafiz Saeed's organization jamaat-ud-dawa and its affiliate organization Falahi Insaniyat Foundation
 ab ye sanghathan desh main kaam kar sakegaa
 This decision, taken after Hafiz's self-help or terrorist! Imran Khan became Prime Minister, is considered very important in view of both the country's politics and international politics
 ise pehle janvari 2018 main pakistan sarkaar ne haafiz said or uske sanghathan par pabandi laga di thi
 Let us tell you that Hafiz Saeed runs many organizations in Pakistan
 uski is sanstha main kareeb 50 hajaar aatanki hai jinhe wo swayan sevak kah kar bulaata he
 The revelation of the Pak government, however, is that the reality is that what Hafiz Saeed calls himself a volunteer is actually his terrorist
 jo naa sirf kashmir main balki mulk main hone vaali aatanki ghatnaon ke jimmedaar hai
 The reality of the world chemically wanted was already well known
 ab pakistan kii nai sarkaar kii bhi pole pattee khul gai he
 Rebel Congress MLA MTB Nagraj has reached Mumbai on Sunday morning to celebrate his fellow rebel MLA Sudhakar
 congress-jedies gathbandhan ne shanivaar ko nagaraj se baatcheet kii thi taaki karnataka kii echdi kumaraswami netritv vaali sarkaar ko bachaane ke liye unhen manaaya ja sake

 However, it has not been officially announced
 sudhakar se naa mil paane ke sawaal par nagaraj ne kaha, 'tab, meraa nirnay kya hoga, main is par kal subah faisla karuunga'
 On the question of not agreeing to withdraw Sudhakar's resignation, Nagraj said, 'I will consider it and take a decision again
 ' kumaraswami ke vidhansabha main vishwaas mat hasil karne kii achaanak kii gai ghoshnaa ke ek din baad gathbandhan ke netaa ek ke baad ek baithak kar rahe hai
 The meeting with Nagraj is also a part of these meetings
 nagaraj un paanch baagi congress vidhayakon main shaamil hai, jinhone vidhansabha adhyaksh keaar ramesh kumaar par unka istipha sweekaar naa karne kaa aarope lagaate hue supreme court kaa rukh kiya he

 do nirdaleey vidhayakon ke samarthan ke saath 224 sadasyeey sadan main bhaajapa ke vidhayakon kii sankhya 107 he
 The congress-jds coalition government is under threat due to fear of accepting the resignation of rebel mlas
 16 vidhayakon ke istife manjuur kiye jate hai to gathbandhan kii sankhya ghatakar 100 rah jaaegi

 Union Women and Child Development Minister Maneka Gandhi has said that she has written several times to every MP to inspect the childhouses of her constituency, but none of the public representatives reached the homes even once
 chaunkaane vaali baat yah he ki zyaadaatar saansadon ko aise kisi patr kii jaankaree nahin he
 In this regard, the team till date contacted many mps from Uttar Pradesh, but most of them expressed ignorance about this letter
 haalanki kuch nechittheemilne kii baat to sweekaar kii, lekin unhone use zyada tavajjo nahin di kyonki unhen yahi pataa hi nahin tha ki chitthee main kya likhaa he
 Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP Raghavan Lakhan Pal of Saharanpur has admitted that he has received the letter, but after the death of Atal Bihari Vajpayee, he was unable to visit the shelter home in his area due to the busy Kalash Yatra
 fursat milte hi vah is kaam ko anjaam de paaenge
 Chitrakoot MP Bhairo Prasad Mishra said that he had received the letter but he does not know what is written in it and he does not even know when the letter was received

 Badaun MP Dharmendra Yadav said that thanks to Maneka Gandhi for doing this, but no such letter has been received from his office so far

 What Maneka Gandhi did was Dawamenka said, 'I have been writing to all mps for the last four years that they should monitor the child houses in their areas because the government cannot always inspect
 maine unako unke kshetron ke sabhi baalagrihon kii suchi saunpi

 Noted film and television star Bobby Darling has sought divorce from her husband
 mumbai ke family court main unhone talaak ke liye ghasita he
 But Bobby's husband has declared the marriage illegal under the Hindu Marriage Act
 bataa den, bobi darling kaa asli naam pakanj sharma hai
 He has kept his name Pakhi after undergoing gender sex surgery
 ye maamla 2016 kaa he jab paakhi urf bobi darling ne bhopal main shaadi kii thi
 Soon after the marriage, their relationship soured
 bobi ne dilli main apane pati ke khilaaf aapraadhik maamla darj karvaa diya
 Now, after three years of marriage, Bobby is seeking a divorce of 2 crore rupees from her husband
 sirf yaheen nahin, unhone court se apil kii he ki ve unke pati se oshivara vaala flats bhi waapas len
 Let me tell you, Bobby gave this flat to his husband as a gift
 iske alaava ve bhopal ke flats par bhi apana haq jamaa raheen hai
 According to him, the flat is the result of her hard work, but her husband forcefully got her joint registry done
 bataa den ki ye to maamle kaa sirf ek pahalu he
 Bobby's husband Ramnik Sharma has brought a twist in this case
 court main unki taraf se vakil jije ramchandani or hitesh ramchandani ne daleel di he ki ye shaadi hindu marij act ke tahat vaid nahin he
 He even said that it was not written anywhere in the law that if a man changes his sex and becomes a woman, then he will be seen as a woman
 bataa den, hindu marij act ke tahat sirf purush or mahila kii shaadi ko hi vaid bataaya gaya he
 In an interview to the news website, Ramnik's lawyer has revealed that Pakhi aka Bobby had not told the marriage registrar about his sex change
 lekin is daleel ko bobi kii vakil bhaavana jadhav ye kahkar galat tehra rahi hai ki shaadi se pehle unki clanit ne marij register ko apane sabhi dastavej die the jisamen unako mahila bataaya gaya he
 He emphasized that when Ramnik found that flat in the gift, Pakhi Sharma wrote on the paper of that flat
 unhone kaha kii ramanik kii niyat thik nahin he kyonki unhone gift lete samay unhen mahila ke rup main sweekaar kiya lekin bobi ab jab apni haq kii baat kar raheen hai to wo unke liye mahila nahin hai
 For information, Bobby Darling has been seen in many serials such as 'because Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi', 'sasural Simar Ka', 'kasauti Zindagi Ke'
 iske alaava wo rielti sho big bos ke sisan 1 kaa bhi hissaa thi

 The opposition party BJP walked out of the House before the Maha Vikas Aghadi government's trust vote led by Uddhav Thackeray
 shivasena-ensipi-congress gathbandhan sarkaar ne sadan main hue matdaan main 169 maton ke saath vishwaas mat (maharashtra Floor Test) hasil kiya
 105 BJP mlas walked out before voting in the 288-member House

 Chief spokesperson of NCP Nawab Malik said that with the approval of Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari, Valse Patil was appointed as the acting president
 rajyapal kii manjuuri ke baad hi satr yojit kiya gaya
 Twist can come again in Maharashtra because of a rule? BJP said- can be told by the Supreme Court, "they wanted some excuse to run away from the house, so this uproar
 devendra ji (bhaajapa netaa devendra fadanvis) ko varisht bhaajapa netaa ekanath khadse se sikh leni chahie ki ek vipakshi netaa ko kaise kaam karnaa chahie
 NCP MP Supriya Sule also said that the BJP ran away with a vote of confidence
 unhone kaha, ‘‘ham puri tarah loktantric hai
 We will not suppress the voice of opposition
 hamaare liye yah nijee ladaai nahin he
 We will win their hearts with love
 ''sule ne kaha, ‘‘maharashtra main kabhi pratishodh kii bhaavana nahin dekhi gai
 Our government will not work with a vengeance spirit
 
 
 jab vishwaas mat chal rahaa tha tab ve (bhaajapa) bhaag gaye
 Congress leader and former Chief Minister Ashok Chavan said that Fadnavis should have welcomed Uddhav Thackeray with an open heart
 chavaan ne kaha, ‘‘lekin iske bajaay unhone maamuli takneekee mudda uthaaya
 this is not right
 '' Congress National Vice President Rahal Gandhi said that the Congress government is going to be formed in Madhya Pradesh, this government will be for the poor, dalit, tribal and common man
 yah sarkaar kamjor varg ke liye kaam karegi
 Rahul Gandhi, who came to campaign in support of Congress candidates in Madhya Pradesh, said in Malhargarh, Mandsaur, that only roads, airports and railway stations will do nothing, it will not fill the stomach of the poor, there is a need to make the poor strong
 yahi kaaran he ki congress lagaataar in virgo ke liye yojanaayen banaakar rajya sarkaron ko dhanrashi de rahi he
 Gandhi further said that the central government has launched several schemes to make the poor, Dalits, tribals and the common people strong
 congress in virgon kaa haath pakadakar vah diwaar giraanaa chaahate hai jo unhen aage badhane se rokatii he, vahiin bhartiya janata party he jo kahati he ki in virgo ke liye paisa kahaan se aayega
 This is the difference between Congress and BJP
 unhone aage kaha ki ham chaahate hai ki desh main koi garib bhookha nahin rahe, koi baccha bhookha nahin rahe
 Plans have been made for this
 congress vaade karne ke baad unhen puraa karti he, vahiin bhaajapa marketing karti he, kai camaron ke jariye apana prachaar karti he, magar camere sachai ko nahin chupa sakate
 Attacking the Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh governments of the Bharatiya Janata Party, he said that the world championship of corruption is going on between these two governments
 is bakawaas ko khatm hona chahie, chhattisgarh kii janata ne unhen baahar karne kaa faisla kar liya he, ab aap bhi inhen baahar karo
 Earlier, National Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi, while addressing the public meeting of Lanji of Balaghat, said that BJP does not see corruption in their states
 yahi kaaran he ki madhya pradesh ke jin mantriyon ke khilaaf bhrashtachar ke lokayukta main maamle darj hai, unke khilaaf karrwai nahin kii
 Gandhi said that the ministers of the Central Government who were accused of corruption were removed, but no action has been taken against one of the ministers involved in corruption in Madhya Pradesh
 yahi fark he congress or bhaajapa main
 Gandhi further said that Congress believes that the poor and weaker sections have to be strengthened, that is why laws like Land Acquisition Bill, Food Security Bill, Right to Information have been implemented
 ham aam aadmi ko taqatvar bananaa chaahate hai
 In Madhya Pradesh, the land of the poor is taken away and given to the rich
 yahaan mahilaon par atyaachaar bade, navjaat shishuon kii maut hui
 Referring to the Women Startup India at the 'shakti' program, Chairperson of the National Commission for Women, Mrs

 Under Women Startup India, we are trying to make women empowered and self-reliant
 isse or duusari mahilaon par bhi acha prabhaav padegaa
 'women have to come to the fore, while speaking on International Women's Day, Lalita Kumarmangalam admitted that the status of the women has improved from the first, but there is a lot of work to do now
 unhone kaha
 'women of the country will have to increase more participation in business
 desh kii arthvyavastha ko behatar karne ke liye mahilaon ko saamne aana hoga or isamen khud ko shaamil karnaa hoga
 If this happens, then surely the situation of women in the country will be completely different in the next five years
 'lalita kumarmangalam ne ‘shakti’ kaarykram main shirkat karte hue ye mana ki mahilaayein hameshaa se khub mehnat karne vaali hoti hai
 Women can work in harmony from home to outside
 bas hota yah he ki mahilaayein apane bare main bataati nahin hai
 There is no shortage of opportunity
 Kumarmangalam clearly said, 'we women have to tell the world about ourselves
 khud ko lekar aawaaj uthaane kii sakht jarurat he
 If women start doing this, then they will also start getting money for business
 jarurat he ki mahilaayein sarkari kaarykram ke bare main jaane
 Learn about how those plans can be used
 aaj kii taarikh main avasar kii kami nahin he
 'supporting women Halilita Kumaramangalam said in her statement,' The work of the National Commission for Women is to support women

 (from input language) ye aankde china se aane vaale maal or bharat se china jane vaale prodctus ke hai
 But if you look at the situation of the figures, then you will understand that in the last 6-7 years, the goods going from India to China decreased and the products of China increased in the Indian market
 or phir 2010 se 2017 ke bich teen guna antar badhkar chah guna ho gaya
 As an Indian, seeing the movements of Chinese soldiers in Doklam and Barahati in Uttarakhand can open the blood of countrymen
 lekin jis tarah chini maal kii gulaami bhartiya maansikta kar rahi he
 What is its solution, as the statistics of the Ministry of Commerce say that Chinese goods have penetrated in every sector in the Indian market
 masalan--cellphone, laptop, solar cell, kii-board, communication equipment, yearphone, ghadiyaan, alsidi-elidi, router, tivi remote or set top box-taale, tibi-kusht rog kii dawaaen, antibiotic dawaaen, khilone, audyogic springs, ball bering se lekar fertiligers tak-furnitures, chini maanjha, bhagwaan kii murtiyon or rakhiyaan tak china kii he
 In fact, this goods of China is cheaper than the goods of India that it is difficult to ignore it as a customer, that is, slavery of Chinese product
 magar seemaa par sena ke jariye deshbhakti ke naare to phir rasta kya he? kyonki bharat china ke jameen kabje se dar rahaa he, lekin bhartiya bazaar par china kabja kiye hue hai to koi ghabrahat nahin he
 At the same time, China makes its market worldwide through the threat of war on the border
 khanij sansadhano kii lut ke jariye china apni iconomi majboot karata he
 The great difficulty of India is that a large population adopts Chinese goods because the boundaries in the field of economy are over and this is our economic policy
 aam graahak ke liye rashtrawaad kaa naaraa saste chini maal ke aage feekaa pad jaataa he or doklam main chini sena ko rokane ke liye mashkkat khub ho rahi he lekin isi daur main chini maal kaa aayaat bad rahaa he
 Chinese companies are unabated in India
 alam ye ki china kii alibaba group ke founder jaikama ne petm main kareeb 68 karod dollar nivesh kiya he to chini travel company si-trip ne mekamitrip main 18 karod dollar kaa nivesh kiya he
 On the other hand, Indian companies are not able to compete with China in the matter of cheap manufacturing and the result is that all the industries from handloom industry to solar panel industry are under the dominance of China
 to khud ko majboot kiye bina china ko parrast kaise kiya ja saktaa he or seemaa par sena se pehle desh ke bheetar se chini maal ko kaise hataaya ja saktaa he
 Its roadmap has not been with any government, then who will end this mentality from cheap goods to stomach for more goods in less rupees and how will slavery of Chinese goods end before the war of Doklam? There is a crisis of 27 crore BPL families in Muflisi, on the other hand, that middle class of 25 crore who want cheap goods who have money to buy and, incidentally, startups Chinese companies have also entered p forbs ke mutabik, chini companiyon ne 2000 se march 2016 ke bich bhartiya starpeps main 1

" ’ Ever since Narendra Modi became the Prime Minister, everyone is seeing the winds of change
 mantralayon or sachivalay ke afasaron ke kaamkaaj kaa tarika badal gaya he
 This change is visible in central government offices, not only in the country but also in foreign countries
 rashtrabhasha kii gaurav ke liye shuru kiya kaam26 may kii shaam narendra modi rashtrabhasha hindi main pradhanmantri pad kii shapath le rahe the or sari duniya televijan par ye najaara dekh rahi thi
 At that time, no one had the idea that for the glory of his national language, Narendra Modi will change the entire history
 khabaron kii maane to pradhanmantri narendra modi ab duniya main jahaan kahin bhi jaaenge sirf hindi main baat karenge
 In September, if Narendra Modi goes to America, then he will talk to President Barack Obama in Hindi
 apni rashtrabhasha ke gaurav se jude modi ke is faisle par to unke virdohi bhi mugdh ho gaye
 We will not leave abroad, it is the time of its Hindi language globalization, in the atmosphere where the emphasis is on maintaining English as a contact language, Narendra Modi is determined to bring glory to his national language
 modi na sirf videsh main jaakar hindi bolenge, balki videshi mehmaan bharat aae to unase bhi baatcheet hindi main hi karenge
 The interpreter will do the work of communicating the language to each other
 narendra modi ne jab saarc rashtradhyakshon se mulaakaat kii to unase bhi baatcheet hindi main hi kii
 Sri Lankan President Mahindra Rajapaksa was speaking in English when he met Modi, but Modi gave his answers in Hindi, which the interpreter explained to Rajapaksa
 oman ke sultan ke vishesh doot ke liye bhi unhone yahi protocol apanaaya
 Now Narendra Modi has started taking this tradition forward
 pradhanmantri kii kursi par baithne ke saath hi narendra modi ne hindi ke liye wo kuch karnaa shuru kar diya, jiske bare main kabhi kisi ne sochaa bhi nahin tha
 Hindi fonts are available in computer
 ird-gird sab kuch hindimay hone laga
 Atal Bihari Vajpayee also gave importance to Hindi
 Let us tell you that Atal Bihari Vajpayee also did something similar
 1977 main janata party kii sarkaar ke dauraan atal bihari vaajapeyi jab videsh mantri the to unhone sanyukt rashtrasang main hindi main bhaashan dekar sari duniya ko chaunkaa diya tha
 In September 2000, Vajpayee visited the US as Prime Minister and once again addressed the United Nations in Hindi
 ab ye karishma bharat ke pradhanmantri narendra modi karne vaale hai
 Modi will visit America in September
 november 2010 main america ke raashtrapati baraak obama jab bharat pahunche the to sansad main unhone joardaar tareeke se jaihind bolaa tha
 Obama knew at least one Hindi word
 ab sitambar main jab pradhanmantri narendra modi se unki mulaakaat hogi, tab baraak obama bhi hindi or hindustan ke rishte se acchhee tarah rou-ba-rou honge
 Opposition to Narendra Modi's Hindi love also influenced Mugdhan Narendra Modi's love for Hindi
 unke mantrimandal ke mantriyon ne hindi ko apanaaya to asar vipaksh par bhi padaa
 This is the reason why Congress President Sonia Gandhi took oath in Hindi
 loksabhaa main congress ke netaa mallikarjun khadge ne bhi hindi main hi shapath lee
 The campaign to change the work culture, apart from this change, everyone is looking at the model and model like Modi's Gujarat model
 desh ko gujarat model narendra modi pehle hi dikhaa chuke hai or ab baari puure desh kii he
 After becoming Prime Minister, Modi launched a campaign to change the work culture
 mantriyon ko sau din kaa agenda banane or us par amal karne kaa kaam saunp diya
 Modi also took the reins of bureaucracy in his hands
 afasaron se kah diya ki mehnat kiijie, idia lie, jab ji chaahe miliye, baat kiijie
 The doors are open
 pradhanmantri banane ke baad modi ne apane pehle bhaashan main kaha tha, 'acha karne kii manshaa se, nishtha se prayaas kiya to desh kabhi naakaam nahin rakhega
 The faith of the people of India should not be lost
 congress se to janata 1967 main hi vimukh hone lagi thi, lekin dusron ne or bhi zyada niraash kiya
 We have to take care of it
 'bhai bhatijawad nahin chalegaaye badalte bharat ke badalte itihaas kii baangi thi
 Along with becoming Prime Minister, Narendra Modi made it clear that he is engaged in the work of creating a new path for himself and the party
 wo pity-pitayee li par chalane vaale nahin hai
 Will draw a new line himself
 or isi disha main unhone saansadon se kah diya ki bhai bhatijawad nahin chalegaa
 An mp-minister will neither give contracts or get contracts to his relatives
 balki saansad pratinidhi rakhte hue bhi dhyaan de ki wo unka rishtedaar na ho
 Modi also told the ministers who took the bureaucracy under their control that they should work on a hundred-day agenda
 to apane bare main bhi kaha ki paanch saal baat wo janata ko apni report saunpenge
 Modi knows that without taking the bureaucracy in trust, it will not be done
 lihaaja unhone tamaam vibhaagon ke sachiv str ke 77 adhikariyon ke saath baithak kii
 In this meeting that lasted for two and a half hours, Modi listened to the officers and gave them the mantra to work in a changed environment
 narendra modi ne na sirf beuroperesi ko apane control main liya he, balki 17 mantralayon ko saat mantralayon main milakar anokhaa karishma dikhaaya he
 Modi linked the Ministry of External Affairs as well as the Ministry of Overseas Indians and entrusted the responsibility to Sushma Swaraj
 vitt mantralay ke saath company mantralay ko jodakar jimmedaari arun jetali ko saunpi
 Modi combined Road Transport, Highways and Shipping together and assigned it to Nitin Gadkari
 urja-koyala-akshay urja ko ek saath laakar swatantra prabhaar vaale piyush goyal ko iskaa bhaar saunpa gaya he
 Modi brought m Venkaiah Naidu as its minister by bringing the Ministry of Urban Development, Housing and Poverty Alleviation under one roof
 modi ne chunaav prachaar ke dauraan vikaas or good gavarnence kaa apana agenda rakhaa tha
 After becoming Prime Minister, he is following the same
 unka mantra hi he- maximum gavarnence, minimum government

 Former Maharashtra Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan recently said in a statement to the reporter that there is a need for an alliance between the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) in the state

 Let me tell you, on the question of bitterness in bjp-shiv Sena alliance, Chavan said that this is just a drama because BJP will not leave the Shiv Sena and take it along at some point during the election to prevent the sharing of Hindutva votes
 
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki bhaajapa sarkaar ko kisaanon or berogari ke muddon par gherna hoga
 On the alliance between the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) in the state, he said that there are hurdles between the two parties regarding the coordination of seats, but to overcome them, the leadership of both have to show maturity
 congress ke 84wein mahadhiveshan se itar party ke varisht netaa chavaan ne 'bhashaa' ke saath baatcheet main kaha, 'donon (congress or rakanpa) ke saath aae bina kaam nahin chalegaa
 If they fight separately, the BJP will probably go ahead because it is doing politics of Hindutva
 voton kaa bantwaaraa rokane ke liye samaan vichaar vaale dalon ko saath aana hoga'
 He further said in his talk, 'there is no choice between the two in Maharashtra
 donon ko saath aana hoga
 If not come together then both will lose and become irrelevant
 sabase zyada choti partiyaan apraasangik ho jaaengi' 
 The former Union Minister said, "when elections are to be held, how will the seats be divided, i am convinced about this
 donon taraf ke netritv ko paripakvata dikhaani hogi'
 He also said that both parties should give up in terms of seat coordination

 We pay taxes so as not to drink poison: India has also started the system of paying cleanliness tax
 haalanki kai deshon main bahut pehle se hi is tarah ke kar adaa kiye jate rahe hai
 a look at these taxes: 1-clean energy cess- This is a type of carbon tax
 jo koyala, lignite or peet (yani ek prakaar kii ghaas jo sukha kar jalaane ke kaam aati he) par lagaaya jaataa he
 The proceeds from this tax payment are used in financial support and research to promote a clean environment

 As of October 2016 through Swachh Bharat Cess, Rs

 But the UK became cautious after the incident

 Under this act, "smog Control Areas" were created and the sources of domestic pollution were identified and banned

 During a football match in Italy, a teenage player gave a loud ruckus to the female referee by giving lewd gestures
 20 saal kii giulia nishatro italy ke shahar mestri main ladakon ke match main referi kii bhoomika nibhaa rahi thi

 uske baad wo hua, jisaki kisi ne kalpana nahin kii hogi
 The player reached the match referee Giulia Nishatro and committed an offensive act
 itnaa nahin, usne kaha ki dam he to maidan se baahar bhejkar dikhaae yaa phir uske saath yon sambandh banaae

 Hi
 
 
 main raveesh kumaar
 The name is Manjhi, but he has trapped many in the mind
 maanjhi jo paar lagaae vaala amar prem kaa gaanaa bihar kii raajnneeti main bahut log ga rahe hai
 The politics of Jitan Ram Manjhi reminds us of the era of Kanshi Ram, when he used to shake hands to get the master key of power and sometimes used to walk
 70 ke dashak ke aakhri saal main karpuri thakur ko kin logon ne apamaanit kiya bihar kii raajnneeti jaanati he
 a Dalit face was discovered by removing Karpoori from his chair, that of Ramsunder Das
 jinhen savarna netaaon ke samooh or jansangh ne samarthan diya tha
 The problem is that you cannot separate Jitan Ram Manjhi from the symbol of social justice, but also do not close the eyes from the politics which is being played in the name of this symbol from Delhi to Patna
 naitikta or nyaay siyasat main kab paakhand he or kab pratik yah is baat par nirbhar karata he ki aap nitish ko pasand karte hai yaa narendra modi ko yaa phir maanjhi ko
 He has been the first of the three parties who removed Manjhi from the post
 congress, argedy or jediu
 But Manjhi will not be able to recover from the setbacks which are not there
 jediu se barkhaast maanjhi istipha nahin de rahe hai or duusari taraf vidhayak dal kaa netaa chune jane ke baad bhi nitish kumaar shapath nahin le paa rahe hai
 The fate of Governor Kesharinath Tripathi is such that wherever he goes, the state of UP assembly is created
 nitish kumaar rajyapal se milakar daawa kar aae hai ki vidhayakon kaa bahumat unke saath he
 Manjhi says it is illegal for Nitish to be elected the leader
 netaa ve hai or sadan main bahumat sabit kar denge
 BJP has not said anything openly
 maanjhi samarthak narendra singh kehete hai ki bijepi kaa saport hasil he
 Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan is talking about working together with Manjhi
 susheel modi chunaav kii baat kar rahe hai
 The BJP will also have to think what will be said at the time of getting rid of Manjhi's support and beaten the social justice
 kahin bijepi kii haalat bhi nitish jaisi na ho jaae
 To support Manjhi means to take all the failures of Nitish and Manjhi government
 or ye saath kab tak kaa he
 The tragedy of Manjhi is that no one wants to make them the boatman of their own boat, but rather all want to make Manjhi a boatman
 maanjhi hai ki tufaan kaa mazaa lenaa chaahate hai
 After all, why is BJP supporting Manjhi? Mahadalit was worried why the BJP did not welcome Manjhi to become CM
 kyon kaha ki ye kathputli mukhyamantri he
 Manjhi was attacked every day
 par is bich maanjhi kaise bijepi ke kareeb pahunch gaye
 Do you want to understand this politics in the class of chemistry or commerce
 ravivaar ko maanjhi dilli main pradhanmantri se 50 minute kii mulaakaat karte hai, baahar aakar istife se inkaar karte hai or nitish ko satta ke bhukhe bataate hai
 a few days ago, Nitish was saying that whenever Nitish would say he would relinquish power
 ab kyon kah rahe hai ki nahin chodenge
 When Manjhi appointed his son-in-law and nephew in November last year, Sushil Kumar Modi sought his resignation
 ab kya susheel kumaar modi maanjhi ko samarthan dekar khud istipha denge
 Is Manjhi not a puppet of BJP? If Nitish was running Manjhi's government through remote, is the BJP not running Manjhi through remote
 ramvilas paswan ke baad maanjhi kaa bijepi kii taraf aana uske saamaajik aadhaar kaa vistaar to karegaa, lekin isse maanjhi yaa dalit raajnneeti ko kya milegaa
 Will the post of chief minister be found after the election? nitish ke kheme main bhi raajnneeti kam ghumaavdaar nahin he
 First came the news that Lalu has taken Manjhi under his influence
 ab lalu nitish ke saath hai
 Nitish had left for Delhi for socialist unity, but now that project is hanging in the balance
 kya loktantr main party or uski sarkaar vaaki itane alag ho sakate hai jahaan donon kaa ek duusare par koi adhikaar na ho
 When has this happened and where has it happened
 apni sarkaar ko kisi duusare ke haath main jate dekh nitish ko kya karnaa chahie tha
 The discarded blanket should have been worn around or should have been removed and come into the arena
 aakhir bijepi ne khud ko is khel se khuleam alag kyon nahin kiya he
 Will she now do politics of inner-state as well
 maanjhi ne piem se milakar kaha ki nitish kaa cheharaa expos ho gaya he
 They are greedy for power, but how does Manjhi remain a monk of power
 sirf isliye ki unke paas ek aisa pratik he jisaki kaat kisi ke paas nahin
 Is BJP doing all this for social justice in Bihar
 to kya bihar vidhaan sabha chunaav main bijepi ramvilas paswan ko mukhyamantri kaa cheharaa banaaegi, maanjhi ko banaaegi
 Amidst all this, you cannot directly reject Manjhi's claims as a leader
 wo apni baat sadhe tareeke se kar rahe hai
 They are neither innocent nor pawn
 par is khel kaa badshaah koun he pataa nahin
 If BJP and Manjhi have exposed Nitish, then the politics of Bihar is seeing which face of these two
 bihar vidhansabha main 9 vidhayak nishkasit hone or ek vidhayak ke nidhan ke baad sadan kii sankhya is vakt 233 he
 117 is needed to prove a majority
 nitish ne 130 vidhayakon ke samarthan kaa daawa kiya he
 JDU has 111, RJD 24, Congress five, one CPI and 5 Independents
 lekin agar sadan ke patal par maanjhi bijepi ke 87 vidhayakon ke dam par jediu or rajd ke baagiyon ke sahare samarthan hasil karnaa chahen to unhen 30 or vidhayak chahie
 Once you see yourself keeping Nitish's place, sometimes you see Manjhi's place and sometimes in Delhi instead of the Prime Minister sitting
 sab ek duusare kii peeth ke peeche chura lekar khadey hai
 The fact is that all this is happening for development
 vah vikaas jo har chunaav se pehle hota he magar chunaav ke baad hote hote rah jaataa he
 The bail plea of former Karnataka Chief Minister BS Yeddyurappa is scheduled to be heard in the High Court on Friday

 Sundararajan was the architect of the recent incident of opening the secret cellars of this temple with huge treasures
 unki maut chatha or antim tahkhaana khole jane ke pehle hui, jabaki iske pehle paanch tahkhaanon se sone, heere or anya beshkeemtee ratnon, or sone ke aitihaasik sikkon kaa beshumaar khajaana niklaa tha, jise gaiyr-sarkari taur par ek lakh karod ru
 Has been judged dilachasp he ki purvavarti travnakor riyasat ke rajpariwaar ke ek sadsy dwaara supreme court ko die halafname main mandir ke tahkhaane khole jane se 'ishwar ke coup' kaa saamana karne kii chetavanee die jane ke maatr do din baad hi hridayaghat ke kaaran sundarrajan kaa dehanth ho gaya
 According to the affidavit filed by Ram Verma, the opening of the remaining cellars would invite destruction, and therefore they should not be opened in any condition, unless the 'devprashanam' process of Jyotish's knowledge of Prabhu Padmanabha's wish or 'devhitam' Not done
 tahkhaane khole jane ke viruddh shraddhaluon kaa kahana he ki sundarrajan kii anpekshit mrityu se unka dar sahi sabit hua he
 The state unit of Shiv Sena, which is opposing the opening of the cellar, says Sundararajan has been punished by God
 shivasena ke rajya pramukh ji
 According to Bhuvanendran, whoever tried to open these cellars in the past has died prematurely
 1970 main samay purv sevanivritti lene ke pehle guptchar beuro main sahaayak nideshak rahe ipies adhikari sundarrajan kii mrityu mandir se sate unke ghar main hi hridayaghat ke kaaran 16 july kii aadhi raat ko ho gai thi
 That original petition in the state high court was filed by Sundararajan in 2009, challenging the royalty's right to operate the temple and consequently on May 2, the Supreme Court directed that the cellars be opened

 swarget police ne maamla darj kar liya he or aaropee kii talash shuru kar di he
 Monday is the day of Lord Shankar
 is din bholenath kii puja karne vaale jaatakon ke man kii muraad puri hoti he
 Lord Shiva is called by his devotees by many names
 koi unhen bholenath kahata he to koi mahadev or mahesh kahkar pukaarata he
 Shiva is also called naive because he does not distinguish between his devotees and does not have to offer expensive or rare things like other goddesses to please them
 
 
 
 So that's why Lord Shiva is loved, according to Vinod Mishra, the month of Savan, Neelkanth is one of the countless names of Lord Shiva
 bholenath ko unke bhakt nilkanth ke naam se bhi jaanate hai
 But do you know why Lord Shankar is called by the name of Neelkanth
 
 
 aaj ham aapako yahi bataane vaale hai
 Know why Lord Shankar is called Neelkanth
 
 
 shiv chalisa kaa paath karnaa he mangalakarisamudr manthan ke baad samudr se kai acchhee chijen nikaleen or saath main vish bhi niklaa
 Both Asura and Sur were ready to take good things, but no one was ready to take poison
 sabase khatarnaak baat yah thi ki agar vish kaa ek bhi boond dharti par gir jaati to tabaahi much jaati
 In such a situation, Lord Shankar drank the poison coming out of the sea to protect the people
 mahesh yaa mahadev, har naam se dukh harte hai shivamaa parvati yah dekh samaj gayi ki bhagwaan shankar ke liye vish ghaatak sabit ho saktaa he isliye unhone apane haathon se bhagwaan shankar kaa galaa pakad liya or vish gale main hi roak liya
 Lord Shiva's throat became blue due to poison and hence he came to be called Neelkanth

 Who was working day and night for this mission
 team me nil armastrang, edwin baj elderin or maaikel colins ko is mishan ke liye chunaa gaya tha
 On July 16, 1969, Saturn v rocket was launched at 08:32 am at Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39A
 nasa ke is mishan ke liye maaikel colins ahm bhoomika nibhaa rahe the jo cmand modul ko chand tak lekar gaye the
 At the same time Neil Armstrong and Edwin Buzz Aldrin stepped on the moon's surface
 duniya kai hajaaron vaigyanikon ke liye ye ek uplabdhi thi
 Let me tell you, Mike Collins's voice starts coming after rocket lift off in the video of Google Doodle
 google doodle par share kiya gaya yah video 4 minute 37 second kaa he
 Learn how the beginning of the space journey took place
 After orbiting the moon, the lunar module, known as the "eagle", separated for a 13-minute journey to the lunar surface
 ye gambhir samasyaayein thim, jo antariksh yatriyon ke liye vinaashkari parinaam ho sakati thim, lekin kismat acchhee thi or kisi bhi prakaar kii anhoni nahin hui
 The astronaut had to face two serious problems
 pehali samasya thi ki nil armastrang or baz elderin ne prithvi ke saath radio sampark kho diya tha
 The other problem was the lack of fuel
 nil armastrang or baz elderin donon ne 20 july, 1969 ko chandramaa ke ek gadde ko aitihaasik rup se aitihaasik chandramaa landing kii shuruyaat karte hue safaltaapurvak 'si of trenquility' ke liye modul diya tha
 On July 25, 1969, the three astronauts returned to Earth and became historical figures not only because of the moon's landing but also because of many scientific breakthroughs
 nil armastrang chandramaa par kadam rakhane vaale prithvi ke pehle vyakti ban gaye the
 He returned and said that "this is a small step for a man, but a giant leap for mankind
" "is din ke liye nil armastrang, edwin "baz" elderin, maaikel colins or 400,000 antariksh team kii khun, paseene or mehnat se hi apollo 11 mishan kaamyaab ho paaya
 That day became memorable for the whole world

 kadru apane putr nagavrind ko amar karne hetu devloak main rakhe amritaghat laane kii maang karti he
 Garuda goes to Devlok to bring his mother to Amritghat for liberation and walks away with Amritghat

 In both there is a fierce war, the place where the nectar is kept during the war is known as Kumbhasthali
