 The Narendra Modi government has always made big claims regarding the Hindi language

 The first line of the smoking prohibition advertisement being aired by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, has a mistake in quantity

 Millions of people see it daily, this is the advertising advertising tag line - 'smoking will be expensive', there is a mistake in quantity in the last word

 On the one hand, while the Modi government talks about the preservation of Hindi, on the other hand, the advertisements being shown to millions of people every day are being stripped of the Hindi language
 piem modi ne guuruuvaar ko bhopal main kaha ki hindi un teen bhashaaon main shaamil he jo aage chalakar digital world main apni dhak jamaayegi
 But this negligence by the government is blowing the air of its claims about enriching the Hindi language

 unhone yah bhi kaha ki jyotish or puranic manyataayen apni jagah hai or ye logon kii aasthaaon se judi ho sakati hai, lekin vigyaan ko inase alag rakhaa janaa chahie, jo prayogon ke aadhaar par siddh hota he

 The reason for the decrease in numbers is not just the fare, however, in response, Hardeep Puri has said that the reason for the decrease in the number of passengers is not only to increase the rent but also other reasons like weather, holidays and festivals
 ek anya sawaal ke jawaab main hardip puri ne kaha ki philhal metro ke kiraye main varisht nagarikon, chaatro or divyangon ke liye riyaayat dene kii koi sifarish kiraaya nirdhaaran samiti ne nahin kii he
 The fare was increased last year
 Hardeep Puri had said in the past that his understanding should give relief to senior citizens and students in the increased rent
 pichley saal dilli metro ke kiraye main do baar badhotaree kii gai thi or kuch duuri ke bich tak to kiraaya doguna ho gaya tha
 3 lakh decrease in number of passengers There was strong opposition to the increase in fare on the 10th of October, and Kejriwal government blamed the Central Government for this
 pichley dinon ek artiai ke jawaab main dilli metro ne bataaya tha ki kiraaya badhane kii vajah se pratidin teen lakh tak yatri kam ho hai

 com / sgergzu0ny Jogram, a former sarpanch of Jabeli village in Dantewada district of south Chhattisgarh, does not remember when the last time a candidate came to campaign in his village
 2013 main jabeli un chah gaanvon main ek tha jahaan ek bhi vot nahin padaa or 21 anya boothon par 10 pratishat se bhi kam matdaan hua tha
 The reason was that the Maoists called for a boycott of the election
 jabeli un tamaam gaanvon main he jo bijapur, narayanpur, sukama, jagadalpur, kondagaanv, kanker or rajanandgaanv jilon main naksaliyon or suraksha balon ke bich jang main fanse hue hai
 Successfully conducting elections to prove whose rule runs here — of the Maoists or the government, would be like a litmus test
 yahi vajah he ki sarkaar or maovadiyon donon ne apni-apni talavaarein khinch lee hai
 There is no noise of demands and promises regarding roads, electricity or tubewells
 na hi in gaanvon main kahin jhande, poster, binar, laudspikar najar aate hai
 No one knows right here that Chhattisgarh is going to hold elections in the first phase on November 12
 maovadiyon ne chunaav bahishkaar kaa aahvaan kar rakhaa he
 District magistrates of Bijapur and Sukma have made a strange request to the Election Commission not to put ink marks on the fingers of voters
 kathith taur par naksaliyon ne dhamkee di he ki jin ungaliyon par matdaan kii syaahi ke nishaan honge, ve kaat di jaaengi
 Chhattisgarh Chief Electoral Officer Subrata Sahu says, Naxal Naxal Election Commission is considering
 koi tarika nikaala ja saktaa he lekin samay kam he
 "as the elections are getting closer, the war is getting intense
" 30 aktubar ko dantewada jile ke aranpur-nilveya road par doordarshan kii ek team par hamalaa hua
 Cameraman Achudanand Sahu and two policemen were killed in the clash
 26 aktubar ko dantewada ke najadik bailadila khadaanon ke paas bacheli main khadey kiye gaye kai vaahanon par chunaav bahishkaar ke naare likhe paae gaye
 On 27 October, a CRPF vehicle was blown up by explosives in Murdanda, Bijapur, killing four soldiers
 28 aktubar ko dantewada ke palnar main bhaajapa ke panchayat sadsy nandlaal madami ko unke ghar main hi raat ke bhojan ke vakt dhardaar hathiyaaron se ghayal kar diya gaya
 If anyone asks in these Naxalite affected villages, he does not give a direct answer about the voting
 potali gaanv ke situ kehete hai, ''ham vot daalenge lekin koi yahaan vot maangane hi nahin aata he
 "there were only 22 votes in 2013 out of a total of 1,100 votes
" inamen zyaadaatar vot aranpur police thane waalon ke the (us samay matdaan centre ko hataakar is police stesan ke paas bana diya gaya tha)
 "no one asked me not to cast a vote but moved 5 km from the polling station here," says Deva of Jabeli village, standing near a water tanker burned by Naxalites a few days ago
 dur sameli main bana diya gaya
 Who will go so far to cast a vote
 '' chunaav ayog kaa nirdesh he ki matdaan centre rihaaish se 2 kimi se zyada dur nahin hona chahie
 But for safety reasons this instruction is not followed here
 to, 2018 main zyada matdaan karaane ke liye rajya sarkaar kii kya yojana he? 2013 main iske liye ek ranneeti apanaai gai thi ki naksaliyon ke niyantran vaale kshetron main matdaan kendron ko surakshit sthanon par bana diya jaae
 This meant that polling stations should be built in residential places located on the roadside, where it was easy for people to reach
 jin jagahon par yah sambhav na ho, vahaan chunaav tiimon ko helicopter se bheja jayega
 Despite this, there are many booths, which can be reached on foot
 rajya sarkaar kii puri koshish he ki is baar 2013 kii sthiti na paidaa na hone paae, jab bahut se gaanvon main vot nahin daale ja sake the
 In 2013, a total of 167 booths in these districts had to be removed and moved to other places
 lekin aisi sthiti se bachane ke liye bade kshetra ko niyantran main lene kaa daawa kiya gaya he
 The plan is that this time fewer booths have to be moved
 udhaaharan ke liye dantewada main jila prashasan kii yojana potali or jabeli main matdaan centre banane kii he
 "in Bastar district, 12 polling stations had to be shifted in 2013, while in 2018 the number has come down to two," says DM Ayyaz Tamboli
 '' dantewada ke dm saurabh kumaar kehete hai, ''jile main yah sankhya ghatakar 18 ho jaaegi, jabaki 2013 main yah 26 thi
 In 2013, 55 polling stations had to be shifted to the neighboring Bijapur district
 is baar yah sankhya kam ho sakati he
 However, what is the reality of political activity on the ground
 nishchit rup se yah acchhee nahin he
 Roads are the lifeline of any election
 lekin surakshakarmiyon or rajnatik kaaryakartaaon kii awajahi mukhya sadakon tak hi simit he
 Election officials who have been allowed to visit villages in the interior have been given the task of updating the voting list
 lekin yah kisi se chupa nahin he ki matdaan soochiyon ko apadet nahin kiya gaya he kyonki koi bhi in gaanvon main nahin janaa chahta
 About one third of the villages in the district in Bijapur are untouched by the activities of political activists and administration
 raipur main ek adhikari kaa kahana he ki kareeb 40 pratishat kshetra ''din main hamaare niyantran main hota he or raat main maovadiyon ke, jabaki ek-tihaai ilaaka hamaare niyantran main he
 The administration has no control in Konta, a southern area in Sukma
 dantewada ke espi dow
 "the situation is much better in 2018 than in 2013," says Abhishek Pallava
 is baar matdaan kaa pratishat badhegaa
 We are providing security to the election machinery
 ''rajnatik partiyon ke liye chunaav main hissaa lenaa sabase khatarnaak kaam he
 Worry does not end even after the voting is completed
 maovadi iviem ko bhi nasht karne kii koshish karte hai
 Polling here usually starts one hour earlier and ends at 3 o'clock in the third hour so that the people associated with the elections reach the streets during the day
 duusari taraf naksaliyon ne bhi kuch hi jagahon par chunaav bahishkaar kaa aahvaan kiya he
 Narayan Vishwakarma, former BJP district president in Dantewada, says, "we won't go to about 60 of the 271 booths in Dantewada
 maovadiyon ne kah diya he ki bhaajapa ko aane kii manaahi he
 Sometimes they give some leeway to others and allow a Jan Adalat
 ''rajya sarkaar koi kasar nahin chhod rahi he
 All 2,700 booths in Bastar Division have been declared as very sensitive
 centre sarkaar kendriya ardhsainik bal (siarpief) kii 600 companiyaan yaa kareeb 72,000 suraksha karmiyon ko yahaan bhej rahi he
 The level of security arrangements can be gauged from the fact that a total of 10,000 security personnel have been deployed in 271 booths in the district, that is, about 40 security personnel at each booth
 is tarah har booth ko kisi kile main tabdeel kar diya jayega
 *** uttarakhand ke itihaas main 18 march 2016 kaa din jisane puure rajya kii raajnneeti main bhuuchaal sa laa diya tha
 Congress-ruled Harish Rawat's government collapsed and the entire 9 Congress, who called themselves Congress soldiers, revolted from their own people, the date which made 9 people rebel is still going on today
 uttarakhand main raajnneetik tufaan he ki thamane kaa naam hi nahin le rahaa he, nau ke baad dhire-dhire kar ab ye ginati 15 tak pahunch gayi he, maano puure 'haath' main sabhi congressi 'camel' khilaane ko betaab ho gaye hai
 From Satpal Maharaj to Narayan Dutt Tiwari, this political war began with Satpal Maharaj, a once staunch Congressman, leaving the party when he quit the party due to differences with Harish Rawat, and shortly thereafter, Chief Minister Harish Rawat took over the Maharaj
 Amrita Rawat, wife of Raman and MLA from Ramnagar in Pauri, was dismissed from her cabinet and indicated that now Uttarakhand Congress The party will have what Harish Rawat would like
 ye sirf ek shuruyaat thi or iske baad maano bargad ke ped kii tarah majboot jadon ke saath khadi congress ke pattey hawa main bikharane lage
 Whether Harak Singh Rawat, the strongman of Garhwal or Kunwar Pranav Singh of Khadar, or Pavije Bahuguna, all said goodbye to the Congress
 narayan dutt tiwari kaa naam kisi bhi pahchaan kaa mohataaj nahin he
 This is the politician whose finger and many leaders including Harish Rawat walked
 lekin 91 varsh kii umr main bete kaa moh hi he jisane itane bade bargad kii jaden umr ke antim padaav main hilaa kar rakh di
 Eventually, the son got the bjp's lotus and went to the lotus of the lotus to offer his blessings
 itane samay se congress se alag-thalag pade tiwari shaayad congress main apni upeksha se dukhi or apane jaivik putr ke bhavishya ke prati chintit the
 The blessings of the elderly Congress leader finally came to the BJP and the 'lotus' also blossomed in Tiwari's 'hand'
 harish or vijay kaa chitthee waar2012 kaa chunaav jitkar aayi congress ke mukhiya kii gaddi par harish ko darkinar kar vijay bahuguna ko baitha diya gaya
 What punishment did Bahuguna have on the head of the Congress in Uttarakhand, a fire broke out inside the party
 chalis saal se bhi zyada ke raajnneetik jivan main kai baar mushkilon kaa saamana kar chuke harish ravat is baar isko bardaasht nahin kar paae or lagaataar apane hi mukhyamantri ke virodh main chitthiyaan likh kar bahuguna kii raah main kaante bichaane main lag gaye 
 Ultimately, due to negligence in the 2013 disaster in the state, Vijay Bahuguna had to leave the Chief Minister's chair and crowned the Chief Minister on the head of Harish Rawat
 virodh ke buland hote sur, baghawat kii shuruatkuch to mukhyamantri banane ke baad harish ravat ke tevar badale or rahi-sahi kasar party alaakaman ne puri kar di
 According to the senior ministers of the party, there was no one to listen to them in the big court even after keeping them in line for two-two months and this was probably the main reason for starting the rebellion
 party main 40 saal tak dalit netritv kii kaman sanbhaalane vaale pradesh ke kaddavar dalit chehre or mantri rahe yashpal aryaa kii maane to congress party ne unhen bahut kuch diya tha lekin baad main sabakuch badalata chalaa gaya
 Yashpal Arya said that there was a time when everything was fine but what happened to the political changes in Uttarakhand, both the party and the government started getting suffocated
 jahaan ek taraf satta main badlaav ke baad harish ravat ke aane ke baad chizein badalane lagi to baaki kasar party ke nae dhurandhar bane prashanth kishor ne puri kar di
 Whenever i tried to ask for time to meet senior party leaders or high command, the answer was that i meet Prashant Kishore
 ye apmaan shaayad 40 saal tak congress ke sipaahi rahe yashpal arya bilkul sahan nahin kar paae or aakhirkaar unhone bhi 'haath' kaa saath chhod 'camel' ke saamne apni shraddha ke haath jod liye
 There is no such name in Uttarakhand Congress other than Harish Rawat, which can be called an organization
 pure sanghathan kii ganth khul gayi or chunaav ke is vakt khud harish bhi nahin samaj paa rahe hai ki ye unki kami kii vajah se he yaa phir ye bijepi kii shatranji chaal he
 However, at this time all the great maharathis have reached BJP and the top of the BJP is eager to win power by winning these elections
 lekin congress ke sabhi mahaarathiyon ke aane se khud bijepi ke kunbe main bhi halchal he, kai bade bhaajapa netaaon ke tikat katane ke baad vidroh kii aag kahin khud bijepi ko hi naa jala de
 Robert Vadra, the husband and businessman of Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, has targeted Finance Minister Arun Jaitley through a Facebook post
 arun jetali ne robert wadra ke congress ke liye prachaar karne kii baat par tippanee kii thi, jisapar fasebuk post ke jariye jawaab diya he
 He wrote that a person should maintain respect and courtesy in every kind of situation
 robert wadra ne apane post main likhaa, ‘’sammaan or shishtachar banaae rakhana hi, vyakti kaa kairactor dikhaata he yahi maine apane abhibhavakon or khel ke jariye jivan main siikhaa he
 Through healthy competition, only a good character of a person will be revealed to people, on which people will decide
 har kisi ko unke bhavishya ke liye shubhakamanaayen’’
 Let me tell you that the news came in the past that Robert Vadra will campaign for the Congress Party in the Lok Sabha elections in Uttar Pradesh
 jisapar vitt mantri arun jetali kii tippanee ai thi
 Jaitley had said that i do not think it will give any benefit to the Congress in campaigning
 media se baat karte hue robert wadra ne prachaar karne kii baat kahi thi, saath hi ye bhi bataaya tha ki vah sonia gandhi or rahul gandhi ke namakan ke dauraan bhi maujuud rahenge
 Significantly, he has already been present during the nomination, but in this way he will come for publicity on the public stage for the first time
 robert isse pehle bhi fasebuk ke jariye bhartiya janata party ke netaaon or nitiyon par sawaal uthaa chuke hai
 Recently, he targeted senior BJP leader LK Advani for cutting the ticket
 wadra ne tab likhaa tha ki agar ham apane varishton kii salaah ko nahin maanate hai to ye sharmnaak he
 The most important pillar of the party has long been forgotten
 gauratlab he ki robert wadra isse pehle bhi tippanee kar chuke hai ki aam kaaryakartaaon kii maang he ki vah bhi loksabhaa chunaav laden

 Only one phase of the Lok Sabha elections (election 2019) is left
 aakiri daur main zubaani hamalon kii raftaar or tej hoti ja rahi he
 Senior Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar has raised the heat once again by justifying his statement that two years ago was vile to PM Modi
 'da print' main chape apane lekh main manishankar ne rajeev gandhi or balakot air strike par piem modi ke bayaan kaa hawala dete hue kaha he ki do saal pehle vah apni tippanee main bhavishyavaanee kar rahe the
 Iyer has also accused PM Modi of lying about his education
 ayyar yaheen nahin ruke unhone piem modi ko deshadrohi or gandi jubaan vaale pradhanmantri tak kaha
 Following the statement of Sam Pitroda about 84 violence between Rahul Gandhi's claim of love politics, this statement of Mani Shankar Aiyar has increased the trouble of Congress
 pitroda ke bayaan kii rahul saarvajanik ninda kar chuke hai, ab dekhnaa hoga manishankar ke is bayaan se congress kaise nikalati he, kyonki chunavi mausam main bijepi is mauqe ko bhunaane kii bharpoor koshish karegi
 Significantly, during the Gujarat elections, Mani Shankar Aiyar used the word 'low' for PM Modi
 haalanki chunaav ke bich main hi rahul gandhi ne manishankar ayyar ko party se nilambit kar diya tha or ayyar ne bhi apni safai main kaha tha ki unki hindi kamjor he unhone angreji ke (low) ke shabd kaa istemaal 'neech' kar diya
 However, PM Modi had made this an election issue and by mentioning it in every rally, the Congress caused considerable damage
 darasal aisa pehali baar nahin hua tha
 In the 2014 elections, Mani Shankar used the word 'chaiwala' for Narendra Modi, and Iyer's statement made PM Modi a part of the election campaign
 isi chunaav main amethi main priyanka gandhi ne bhi 'nichi raajnneeti' kaa shabd kaa istemaal kiya or piem modi ne amethi main hi iskaa zikr raily main kiya ki vah 'neech' jati se aate hai isliye unako nishaanaa banaaya ja rahaa he
 The Congress also suffered a significant loss
 congress abhi sikh dangon par sam pitroda ke bayaan 'hua to hua' se ubar nahin pai he
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi has asked Pitroda to apologize and also said that Pitroda should be ashamed of his statement
 aise main manishankar kaa yah bayaan rahul gandhi ke liye badi musiibat banakar aayaa he
 At the same time, BJP has not taken any time to retaliate on Mani Shankar Iyer's statement
 bijepi pravaktaa sambit paatra ne kaha, 'akhirkaar
 
 
 The 'mani' of the Gandhi family has contributed to the politics of love of Rahul Gandhi in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections by saying his statement 'low' for Modi ji as true

 aipal iphone launch karata he or ye trend duusari smartphone companiyaan pholo karti hai
 Apple has also sued big companies like Samsung for patents and has also recovered huge amount
 is baar aipal ne kaaphi samay ke baad ek nae tarah ke dizin ke saath iphone x launch kiya he
 Gradually some companies have started preparing to bring smartphones that look like iphone X
 is daud main sirf doum darje kii companiyaan nahin hai, balki aisi bhi companiyaan hai jo kaaphi badi hai or duniya bhar main alag pahchaan rakhti hai
 After the OPO, Vivo and ASUS, the One Plus is also seen in this race
 jald hi One Plus 6 launch hone vaala he or report ke mutabik isamen bhi iphone x jaisaa noch diya jayega
 Its picture has also been leaked, in which clearly the same Nokia x can be seen
 kya he nochaaipal ne is baar oled bejal les disple ke saath iphone x launch kiya he
 An empty space in the center at the top of the display that is not part of the display
 isamen front camera or phase idi ke liye kai tarah ke sensors die gaye hai or yaheen par yearpys bhi he
 Now other companies are also bringing smartphones with Bezel Lace Display and giving a notch like iphone x in it
 One Plus ke siio karl pei ne kaha he ki One Plus 6 main diya jane vaala noch iphone x ke mukaable chota hoga
 But it will be bigger than Essential Phone
 karl ne yah bhi kaha he ki One Plus 6 main chin (neeche bejal) bhi diya jayega, kyonki android phone mekar ke liye chin dena jaruri he
 Regarding the iphone X-like notch in the One Plus 6, the company's CEO Carl Pei says that if Apple had not brought it now, then other companies would have brought the feature themselves because it would have been a trend
 da varj se baat karte hue unhone yah bhi mana he ki aipal puri industry ko kuch chizon main teji se aage badhaane main madad karata he
 Asus also said during the Mobile World Congress that it is important to give a notch like the iphone X, because now it has become a trend
 chaahe baad glass metal body kii ho yaphul metal body kii yaa phir antena line kii
 There are many things that other companies have copied continuously
 yahaan tak kii ios jaise fitures or bilkul aisa hi dikhne vaala oes bhi he market main
 The question arises, why do companies do this? The simple answer is that since Apple is a big company and sets the iphone trend, other companies rob the market by giving it cheaply
 lekin kya aipal ko isse nuksaan hota he? jawaab he nahin
 It is worth noting that in this Android P, Google will support Nokia x like Notch
 dene kaa makasad he ye he ki ab aane vaale samay main na sirf kuch android smartphone balki zyaadaatar mid range android smartphone main iphone x jaisaa noch diya jayega
 Now it will be interesting to see which feature Apple sets the trend this year

 Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi, who was the victim of criticism for not going there during the Uttarakhand disaster, is going to visit this state today

 yogi adityanath ne hindu yuva vahini ke kaaryakartaaon ko kadaa sandesh diya he
 While meeting the activists and representatives of the Hindu Yuva Vahini at the Gorakhnath temple, Yogi bluntly said, 'saffron is a symbol of decency
 hamen yah shaleenta barkaraar rakhni hogi
 Strict action will be taken against those who abuse saffron
 'gauratlab he ki iske pehle uttar pradesh sarkaar ke mantriyon ko mukhyamantri yogi adityanath siyasat kaa moolmantra bataa chuke hai, ravivaar ko baari thi hindu yuva vahini kii
 Yogi Adityanath faced the media's questions on the exploits of the saffron brigade as soon as the BJP took over the government
 zaahir he aae din jis tarah bhagava brigade surkhiyon main thi, use dekhte hue yogi ko kesaria kaa phayda uthaane waalon ko chetavanee deni padi
 Agriculture Minister Surya Pratap Shahi said, 'bharatiya Janata Party believes in law and we want to bring rule of law
 koi mantri bhi he to usko kanoon ke hisaab se hi chalanaa padegaa
 The Chief Minister has said the same to his workers
 unhone kaha he ki logon ko hamase apeksha he ki ham kanoon ke hisaab se chalenge
 We are cautioning our workers that public aspiration is with us
 janata kii ummiido par khara utarane ke liye ham ko basapa, sapa se alag vyavhaar karnaa hoga
 'even though the BJP ministers are understanding the meaning of the words of Yogi, the workers feel that this sign of Yogi ji is for the opponents
 hindu yuva vahini ke mahaamantri ne kaha, 'maharaj ji ne un logon ke liye kaha he jo log kesaria kaa gamchaa daal ke daftaron main ja rahe hai or dabaav bana rahe hai, kuch log galat dhang se iskaa istemaal kar rahe hai, un par karrwai bhi hui he
 'some activists said,' This message is actually for the opponents, nowadays even the leaders of the other party are wearing bullying by wearing saffron color
 'darasal go raksha, lav jihad, islamic aatankwaad se lekardharm parivartan parayogi adityanath ke vichaar jagajaahir hai
 When Yogi took charge as chief minister, his critics said that it would be difficult to maintain peace and peace in Uttar Pradesh because of his staunch image
 par pichley dedh maheene main yogi ne apane ishaaron or apane bayanon se yah spasht kar diya ki kanoon sabake liye baraabar he
 Yogis also know that if the message of good governance is to be delivered on the basis of law and order, then the biggest challenge is from our own
 yahi vajah he ki shashan kii shuruyaat main hi yogi ke do took vachan
 
 
 The gesture is enough for the discerning
 kendriya shahari vikaas mantri hardip puri ne dilli ke siem arvind kejariwal kii chitthee kaa turki ba turki jawaab dekar dilli metro ke kiraaya vruddhi yuddh ko ek kadam or aage badha diya he
 In his latest letter to Kejriwal, Puri has questioned Kejriwal's information and told him far from the facts
 bataa den ki pichley chaar dinon se kejariwal or puri ke bich metro kiraaya badhaane ko lekar chitthee likhane ke daur chal rahe hai
 While Kejriwal blamed the central government for blaming the Centre's indifferent attitude in curbing the fare hike, Puri cited sections 86 and 37 of the Metro Railway (operation and Maintenance) Act, saying Kejriwal should know that the fare It is not in the court of the Delhi Metro Rail Board to withhold the recommendations of the FFC
 centre sarkaar bhi kiraaya nirdhaaran ke kshetra main FFC ke kaam main koi dakhal nahin detii
 Ignoring this truth, you are constantly applying the rhetoric of your own talk
 mujhe is par hairat he
 The Minister of Urban Development has also responded to Kejriwal's three suggestions
 dilli metro dilli sarkaar ko chalaane ke liye saunpe jane kii peshkash par centre ne saaf kaha he ki dmarsi kii niti ke mutabik ye mumkin nahin he
 As per the policy, the joint venture of Metro is in the ratio of 50:50 with DMRC
 aise main kisi rajya ko ise saunpa nahin ja saktaa
 dmrc's metro capacity and efficiency has now become a brand in the world
 ise kisi or ko dene kaa sawaal hi nahin
 Puri has also taken a dig at Kejriwal saying that maybe your officers did not brief you in a proper manner, so let me tell you that while making the metro policy, i had sought suggestions and advice from states and union territories
 lekin ab aap metro main kuch karnaa chaahate hai to phej 4 main apana yogadan kar sakate hai
 It is already running two and a half years late
 ise puraa kar den
 Through this, 40 lakh people of Delhi will connect with the cities of NCR
 puri ne ye bhi joda ki aapako ditisi kaa anubhav bhi isamen aapke kaam aayega
 And my best wishes are with you
 iske baad puri nekejariwal kii chittheemen diye gaye aankadon kii dhajjiyaan udayi hai
 - The FFC recommends a 91% fare increase to 7% per annum
 aapkaa aankada satya se pare he
 - Metro project is not for short distance
 - kolkata metro kii aapane duhai di he to aapako maaloom hona chahie ki kolkata metro na to dmarsi kii tarah swatantra he naa hi 50:50 model par he or na hi aise kisi formule par
 It is a part of Indian Railways
 isi ke financiel saport par rahati he or wo bhi baari ghate main
 Now let's see when CM Kejriwal writes the next letter stung with answers and how
 
 
 baapu ke naam par sarkaar sachai se munh chipa rahi he
 Tourism Minister Ambika Soni says that it was the government that asked Vijay Mallya to participate in the auction of Bapu's heritage
 jabaki maalya kehete hai ki aisa kuch hua hi nahin
 Despite all the claims of the Government of India, the personal belongings of the Father of the Nation went up for auction
 bas shukr he to itnaa ki sabase oonchi boli lagane vaala shaks ek bhartiya hi tha
 UB Group owner Vijay Mallya bought all the things auctioned by Gandhiji, but the government was busy declaring Vijay Mallya's highest bid as his success
 paryaton mantri ambika soni ne kaha ki bharat sarkaar ne vijay maalya ko nilaamee main shaamil hone ke liye aadhikarik rup se chunaa tha
 Vijay Mallya did not like this about Ambika Soni
 unhone is baat ko saraasar galat qaraar diya
 Mallya said that the government had not approached Gandhiji to buy things
 vijay maalya ne kaha ki unhone rashtrapita kii chizon ko nilaamee main apane boote kharida he or sarkaar kaa isse koi lenadena nahin he
 Yes, they definitely want to hand over these things to the government
 maalya ne isse pehle bhi nilaamee main rashtriya dharoharon ko duusare mulk ke haath lagane se roka he
 a few days ago he had also bought Tipu Sultan's sword at auction
 lekin is baar maalya kii jeet kaa sehara sarkaar apane sir par baandhne ko utaavali dikhaai de rahi he or ye baat maalya ko manjuur nahin
 Polluted air is a major problem in the country's capital, Delhi
 is bich south dilli ilaake main hajaaron ped kaatane ke maamle ne aam logon kii chintaa ko kaaphi badha diya he
 After the matter reached the High Court and stopped the felling of the trees till 4 July, the team of 'aaj Tak' checked the reality of the ongoing NBCC project in Netaji Nagar
 'ajtak' kii team ne south dilli ke netaji nagar se pedo ko kaatane ke evaj main lagaae jane vaale paudhon kii khoj shuru kii
 Many years old trees have been pruned throughout the region, including neem trees
 netaji nagar ke park or anya jagahon par ab bhi kaate hue ped ke hisse dekhe ja sakate hai
 However, in the area where we were present, the plants planted before or after cutting trees were not seen anywhere
 aapako bataa den ki netaji nagar main kul 2294 hareped kaatane kii anumatidi gayi thi
 As per permission, 856 trees were to be cut in the first phase, but only 202 trees were cut
 anumati kaa notification 23 april 2018 ko jari kiya gaya tha
 Also, the NGT had ordered that 10 saplings should be planted in lieu of cutting 1 tree
 is bich NBCC ne apane oficial twitor handle se ek bayaan jari kar apane hi thekedaaron ko hidaayat di he
 "have instructed all contractors carrying out redevelopment of 3 colonies in Delhi by NBCC, not to cut any trees
 In the event of any breach, they will be held responsible for all consequential damages arising there from"- Dr
 AK Mittal, CMD, NBCC # nbccbuildsindia @ mohua_india — officialnbcc (@officialnbcc) June 26, 2018 a large number of old houses are being demolished in the NBCC project along with tree cutting
 hairaani kii baat yah he ki makaan todane ke baad malwe ko khule main rakhaa gaya he
 While the NGT has ordered Malwa to be covered green
 itane bade project menniyamon kii andekheeki ja rahi he
 Meenakshi Nath, associated with the My Right To Breathe team, toured the area with Aaj Tak's team
 minakshi paryaavaran kii jaankaar bhi hai
 Meenakshi Nath said that after cutting the trees, the remaining houses will be demolished, which will increase the level of PM 10 in the air and in the surrounding areas

 Bumrah gave 42 runs in 4 overs, while Ashwin was given 20 runs in 2 overs so expensive that Dhoni was not bowled the rest of the overs
 jadeja 4 overon main 48 ran to pandya ne 4 over main 43 ran die
 West Indies batsmen beat Indian bowlers around the field
 windies ke ballebaajon ne match main 11 chakke or 20 chauke barasaaye
 But it would not be right to blame the bowlers alone only because the hero of the match, Simmons, was caught twice

 What kind of new office of the Prime Minister will be reached to the extent of madness towards work? However, the work of restructuring Narendra Modi's PMO is still going on
 lekin chaar baar gujarat ke mukhyamantri rahe modi ke gandhinagar sthit karyaalay par ek najar daalen to kaaphi had tak is sawaal kaa jawaab mil saktaa he
 Starts from here
 sabase pehle ucch str par teen niyuktiyaan to bilkul tay hai- 1967 batch ke uttar pradesh cader ke sevanivrutt iees adhikari nripendra mishra pradhanmantri ke nae pradhan sachiv honge
 Former Director of Intelligence Bureau A
 ke
 Doval will become National Security Advisor
 modi ke sabase bharosemand 1988 batch ke iees adhikari e
 K
 sharma unke vishesh kaary adhikari (oesady) honge
 Sharma was the additional principal secretary to Modi in Gujarat
 modi ke do nijee sahaayak om prakaash singh chandel or dinesh thakur ab piemo main pahunch gaye hai
 Both of them have been associated with Modi for the first time since he became the Chief Minister in 2001
 iske alaava gujarat main modi ke purv jansampark adhikari (piaaro) jagadish thakkar, ko mukhya jansampark adhikari banaae jane kii bhi ummid he
 Thakkar specializes in preparing Modi's press note
 do purv mukhya sachivon samet kai varisht naukarshahon kaa yah maananaa he ki pradhanmantri piemo main fatafat niyuktiyaan karne kii hadabadi main bilkul nahin hai
 Both these senior officials have closely observed Modi's way of working in Gujarat since 2001
 unka maananaa he ki pehle ve dilli main naukarshahi or uski kaaryastylee ko samajhane kii koshish karenge
 Modi will then identify the officials whom he would like to take to the PMO
 gujarat cader ke ek iees adhikari kehete hai, ‘‘modi ke kaam karne ke khaas andaaj ko dekhte hue yah saaf jaahir he ki ve piemo main sahi niyuktiyaan karenge
 Even if this work takes them some time
 modi kii kaaryastylee kuch aisi he ki ve chaahate hai ki naukarshahi unki soch ko samajhe or phir use prabhavi dhang se lagu kare
 Soon the work of giving presentations of their respective departments is about to begin
 ve is maukey kaa istemaal sahi aadmi ko chunane ke liye kar sakate hai
 '' Former Chief Secretary of Gujarat D
 rajagopalan wibrant gujarat, nivesh sammelan or kanya shiksha tathaa i-gram jaise kai mahatvapurn kaaryakramon par kaam kar chuke hai
 Rajagopalan says that the new Prime Minister would like his office to maintain complete coordination with all the states
 khaas taur par agar unhen desh bhar main apane gujarat model kii nakal kerani he to iske liye yah talmail or bhi jaruri he
 Rajagopalan says they can also keep in mind their employment generation model and areas like education and health for appointments in pmos
 ve kehete hai, ‘‘nivesh ko aakarshith karne or buniyadi dhaancha khadaa karne ke liye ve vyavastha banaaenge or phir use apane aap kaam karne ke liye mukt kar denge
 But for creating new jobs and key areas like health and education, they will need officers who can read their minds
 aise adhikari, jo mantralayon ke kaamkaaj par niyamit rup se najar rakhte hue unhen lakshya ko hasil karne main madad kar saken
 "when we looked at Modi's old Chief Minister's office in Gandhinagar, there were different types of officers
" ab piemo main bhi yahi mishran dekha ja saktaa he
 His old office in Gandhinagar was a symbol of hard work
 chaturth shrenee ke karmchaaree se lekar iees adhikari tak sabhi subah 10 baje se lekar raat 8 baje tak kaam karte the
 The departments in the CMO have four IAS officers — K
 kailashnathan, ji
 C
 murmu, e
 K
 sharma or vijay nehra-ke bich baanta gaya tha
 Every officer used to make the secretary of the concerned department acquainted with the Chief Minister's thinking and his goals and kept an eye on their functioning
 dilli kii naukarshahi main ek baat nai hogi or vah he vibhaagon ke bich talmail ke liye hone vaali baithken
 Rajagopalan recalls that during Modi's time in 2003, these meetings used to run for more than three months for mutual coordination in the Gujarat administration
 in baithkon ke kaaran vibhaagon kaa kaamkaaj sahaj dhang se chalata tha
 Another chief secretary, who has worked with Modi in Gujarat, says, "every step of his is very thoughtful
 har kadam kaa makasad behtareen nateeja hasil karnaa hota he
 They never do any work in haste and haste
 ’’pradhan sachiv ke rup main nripendra mishra kaa chunaav karne main bijepi ke kuch varisht netaa, adhikari or modi ke nikat sahyogi amit shah kii bhoomika kaaphi ahm thi
 Modi wanted to make an honest, capable and physically fit person as Principal Secretary
 is pad ke liye ritair ho chuke teen pratishthit adhikariyon ke naamon par vichaar kiya gaya tha-purv grih sachiv anil baijal, deepak bhattacharya or nripendra mishra
 Most people believed that Baijal should be rejected despite his intelligence, honesty and experience of working in various fields as he was once very close to senior BJP leader LK Advani
 bhattacharya kaa naam unke swasthya ke kaaran khaarij kar diya gaya
 Modi is considered a man of hard work
 pichley saal unke ek kareebi sahyogi ke pittashay main pathari ho gai, kyonki unhen der raat tak kaam karnaa padataa tha
 He had worked in Modi's CMO since 2001
 unhen turant oparation karana padaa or uske baad se unhen halkaa kaam de diya gaya he
 It was important in Mishra's favor that he did not show any longing for himself after retiring
 telecom, vitt, rasayan or urvarak jaise mantralayon main unka kaam bhi bahut acha mana gaya
 Modi's ability to work professionally and to employ subordinate officers very efficiently impressed Modi
 dobhaal kii niyukti 16 may ko chunaav nattejey aane se pehle hi apekshit thi kyonki bijepi or sangh parivaar main unki acchhee pahunch he
 Though he is yet to be formally appointed, the government has issued an ordinance to appoint Mishra
 rashtriya suraksha par dobhaal ke vichaar na sirf modi, balki puure sangh parivaar se mail khate hai
 As a director of the rss-backed think tank Vivekananda Foundation, he has been providing information to the Sangh Parivar on national and internal security issues
 dobhaal aresas ke us vistaarit kaarykram kii dein hai, jise sangh ne 15 saal pehle mohan bhagwat ke aresas ke sar kaarywah banane ke baad shuru kiya tha
 This program works to connect people in high positions with the Sangh and tries to tell them that the ASS wants to rise from the ranks of caste and sect and develop the nation
 ab is kaarykram ke pramukh or aresas ke pravaktaa ram madhav ne dobhaal ko sangh parivaar ke nikat laane main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai thi
 Although the full face of Modi's PMO will be known only after some time, but there is no doubt that it will be completely different from the past

 ’ This story is about Pappu studying in a government school
 baat 1990 ke dashak kii shuruyaat kii he
 Right now the liberalization was knocking and everything was very limited
 pappu ne abhi 14wein saal main kadam rakhaa tha or uske andar baaki kishoron kii tarah jigyaasaaen hiloren maarane lagi thim
 Often he wandered in Hindi films to find the meaning of falling flowers and the meaning of extinguishing a lamp
 ek din use apane in saaron kaa jawaab mil gaya or yah jawaab se mila apane dost se mili mastaram or debonaire kii fatty-puraani copy se
 Now he had become a part of that jolly group of school boys
 is toli ke sabhi saathi apni-apni pocket mani ek jagah ekatra karte or phir bas adde yaa railway stesan jate
 They brought books with yellow foil from there
 jisamen 84 rangeen asana sahit porn saamagree parose jane kii baat hoti
 Of course, only the perfect black-and-white pictures would be found inside, but there were enough to calm the curiosity of Pappu and his friends
 debonaire kaa centerfoldunakaa pasandida panna hua karata tha
 Pappu had climbed first
 uski jigyaasa khatm hone kaa naam nahin le rahi thi, or is tarj par bad rahi thi ki ek baar dekha he, baar-baar dekhnaa he
 He climbed up the next rung
 usne apane doston kii toli ke saath morning sho kaa rukh kiya
 He would enjoy the hot posters outside the cinema hall and would get money from a few scenes inside
 pappu bataate hai ki unka yaadgaar film maay tutor rahi, jiske morning sho house phul chalate the
 Then time turned
 baat 2001 kii he
 Technology had progressed
 sidi bazaar main aa gai thim
 In the Palika Bazar and Lajpat Rai Market, he got his job and Pappu had passed the college and started working
 chori-chhipe masala filmein yahaan sekhridta or apanecomputer par dekhtaa or is tarah raaten katati
 By that time, this inward CD had ended the morning show and closed the yellow foil bookstore
 ab bas adde par bori main ashleel kitaaben chhipaakar bechney vaale bhi khatm ho gaye the
 Time was galloping
 nai sadi kii sabase badi dein internet or mobile rahaa
 In the initial phase internet was expensive but by 2004-05 it was becoming cheaper and Pappu also got a connection in his house
 akasar samay mast chating yaa phir porn site dekhne par gujarata
 If Pappu spent 100 percent of the time on the Internet, then he would spend 60-70 percent of his time on pornographic sites
 saal 2010 aa gaya tha
 Technology was continuing and then the smartphone arrived
 is samay tak vaai-fi bhi ghar-ghar main lag chuke the or pappu bhi isse las the
 Pappu had started sleeping on the phone through wi-fi, getting up and enjoying porn whenever he wanted
 mobile ke alaava vah hard discs kaa istemaal karnaa sikh gaya tha
 He had become an expert on torrent sites, and most of the permanent doses of porn, if viewed from a smartphone, loaded a lot of movies from the torrent site
 baat vartmaan kii karte hai
 Now that porn sites have been banned in the country, Pappu says, "this decision is somewhat strange
" lekin kya kar sakate hai
 This ban will again heat the palace market and Lajpat Rai stalled business
 un becharon kaa kaarobaar chal nikalegaa
 Clip loader in mobile memory card for 10 rupees will capture the movement and thrust
 ho saktaa he hamaare jamaane vaali kitaaben phir se bikne lagen
 By the way, those who are knowledgeable of torrents, their world is still in the grasp
 ve to apane paanv par khadey hai, chaliye sidhe clip na sahi downlod karke hi, ve to jugad kar hi lenge
 Some people can also connect through a proxy server
 haalanki aaj technology he, sab kuch he, lekin ham bharatiyon kii ek gadabad he, ham ek kadam aage badhate hai to chaar kadam peeche chale jate hai
 Is Pappu right? (pappu is a fictional character

 Several other members in the House also stressed the need to make children aware of good and bad motive touch (good Touch and Bed Touch)
 bryan ne kaha ki samaaj main ab purushon ko bhi is tarah kii ghatnaon kaa ullekh karne main sankoch nahin karnaa chahie
 He said that instead of hiding the experience like this, children should be encouraged to talk about it openly
 unhone kaha ki is vidheyak main child pornography ko paribhaashit kiya gaya he taaki aise aparaadhon ko rokane main madad mil sake
 He has supported the proposal to include capital punishment in the POSCO Amendment Bill for sexual harassment of children
 vahiin bryan ke is anubhav par khulkar sabake saamne rakhane ke liye mahila evam bal kalyaan mantri smriti irani ne unki himmat kii prashansa kii

 Irani said that the government has prepared a national database of sexual offenses
 aise 6,20,000 apradhi hai
 If someone hires such people, it will help to get information about the person concerned

 • If there are questions, do not share them with other groups
 • sawaal agar samuhik bhi hon to ve keval itihaas se puche jaaen, vartmaan ko keval dhanya bhav se suna jaae

 Statistics vs
 experience 'first of its kind', 'biggest yet', 'first time in the history of the country' —now, the speeches of the leaders are not without them

 Now, there is no bonding without raw, solid, hollow figures

 The trouble is that people's experiences are more powerful than statistics

 So when people's private and authorized senses move forward sitting on collective social networks, the credibility of government data becomes a waste

 It would not be wrong to say that for the next few matches, this Karnataka player has captured one end
 mayank agarwal ne khele donon test maichon main dikhaaya ki vah test ke saath-saath vanade kii batting karnaa bhi bakhubi jaanate hai
 By the way, if Mayank Agarwal can develop such a style of batting, then the reason behind this is Team India's veteran opener Virender Sehwag Happy birthday to the most beautiful, Caring, Understanding person in my life whom i will always love and Respect Wishing you lots of Happiness , Health and Laughter Aashi # happybirthday # ashkaromayankpic

 com / sopdzpmfvnmayamka kehete hai ki agar vah apane kariyar main sahvaag kaa aadha bhi hasil kar sake, to yah unke liye badi uplabdhi hogi
 Well, call it a coincidence or something that Irfan Sait, the personal coach of Sanjay Manjrekar and Mayank, are from people who have seen a little Sehwag inside Mayank Agarwal
 australia main do test khilne ke baad hi unki style kii charchaa virendra sahvaag se hone lagi
 By the way, let me tell you that Mayank considers his ideal Virender Sehwag and likes to bat in his style
 Also, what a learning curve to be at the non-strikers end with @cheteshwar1 in this series! Controlled aggression with soldiered discipline
 Here's to many, many more

 cheteshwar pujaara or viraat kohli se bhi zyada
 Pujara's strike rate of 41
 41 tha, to kohli ne 41
 Runs at the rate of 22
 lekin isamen bhi agar mayank ke swabhaav ko samajhane to aap isse samajhie ki unhone pant ke baraabar hi 5 chakke lagaae
 Pant hit these sixes in 4 Tests, then Pant took two Tests for this
 yahi kaaran he ki mayank kii style kii tulana sahvaag ke andaaj se honi lagi he
 Mayank played 77, 76 and 42 runs in Australia
 unki yah paariyaan bharat ke liye bahut hi ahm samay par ain
 Mayank says that to be honest, i do not trust in comparison
 sahvaag bharat ke mahanatam khilaadiyon main se ek rahe hai
 As far as my playing style is concerned, i look forward to playing in the field in my best style and the result
 agar main sahvaag kii uplabdhiyon kaa aadha bhi hasil kar sakaa, to main khush rahoonga
 There was no sticker on Mayank's bat during all three innings played in Australia, but now he is expected to get a sponsor soon

 The election campaign of Karnataka is in full swing
 bijepi kii taraf se pradhanmantri narendra modi to congress kii taraf se rahul gandhi apane dalon kii kaman sanbhale hue hai
 On Thursday, the two addressed several rallies in the hyderabad-karnataka region
 yah karnataka kaa purvottar ilaaka he jo 23 fisadi kshetra main failaa he or isamen 40 vidhansabha siten aati hai
 The two leaders are leaving no stone unturned to shoot at each other
 rahul gandhi ne guuruuvaar ko karnataka main chaar reliyon ko sambodhit kiya
 In Aurad, Bhalki, Humnabad and Bidar
 sabhi hyderabad karnataka ilaake ke bidar jile main aate hai
 PM Modi addressed three rallies in Kalbargi, Ballari (both in Hyderabad Karnataka) and North Bangalore in Gulbarga
 hyderabad-karnataka naam purvottar karnataka ke un ilaakon ko diya gaya he jisamen purvavarti hyderabad rajya ke kannada bhashi log rahete the
 Let us know what the two leaders said about each other and who, how successful they were
 
 
 vichaardhaara banaam pradarshanrahul gandhi:yah chunaav do vichaardhaaraon ke bich kii ladaai he
 On one side is the Congress whose ideology is of unity, compassion and inclusive Karnataka, on the other hand, there is BJP-RSS whose ideology is of hatred and division
 bijepi-aresas ko karnataka kii janata kii aakanksha kii parvaah nahin he, yah keval karnataka ke logon kii aakankshaon kaa vibhaajan karnaa jaanati he, yah keval chunaav jinate ke liye logon kaa dhuvikaran karnaa jaanati he
 Narendra Modi: The Karnataka government has slept for the past five years and the state is being affected by their inertia
 kisaan pareshaan hai, kapadaa, emsamai sector ko sahyog nahin mil rahaa or bhrashtachar charam par he
 So it is not surprising that people are ready to reject the Congress
 hamaari raay:rahul gandhi ne din kii shuruyaat bijepi par yah aarope lagaate hue ki vah dhruvikaran kii raajnneeti kar rahi he
 This is an old accusation of Congress leaders on BJP
 narendra modi ne iske jawaab main congress sarkaar ke karnataka main pradarshan par sawaal khadaa kiya
 Personal Attack vs
 Honor Rahul Gandhi: When PM Modi becomes impatient, he comes down to personal attack and character abuses
 main kabhi vyaktigat hamale nahin karata
 Instead, i ask questions, PM Modi never answers these questions
 piem modi karnataka ke bare main kuch nahin kehete or rajya ke logon ke liye unke paas koi yojana nahin he
 Narendra Modi: The Congress does not even respect our sacrificial soldiers
 jab hamaare sainikon ne sargical strike kiya, to besharm congress party ne sargical strike par sawaal uthaae
 He asked for proof of this
 kya congress chaahati he ki hamaare jawan camera or bandook lekar jaaen!hamaari raay:rahul gandhi jab apane ko raajnneeti kaa 'acha ladkaa' dikhaate hue piem modi ke prachaar style par sidhe hamalaa kar rahe hote hai, tab vah apni sarvshereshth vaak kala kaa pradarshan karte hai
 In response to this, Narendra Modi reveals the phantom of the surgical strike that our soldiers had done across the Line of Control in 2016
 bhrashtachar kaa indradhanushrahul gandhi:film sholay main gabbar singh tha
 You brought Gabbar Singh Tax (GST joke), but this time you have surpassed it
 aapnegabbar singh ke puure gangko laga diya
 There was Gabbar's gang, then here is the Reddy Brothers gang, which was in jail
 aap unako vidhansabha main laane kii taiyaari kar rahe hai, or aap desh ko bataa rahe hai ki aap bhrashtachar ke khilaaf lard rahe hai
 PM Modi sits on the stage with Yeddyurappa and speaks against corruption
 narendra modi:ballari (purv naam bellari) kii janata ko un logon ko sabak sikhaanaa chahie jo ki ballari kii chhavi ko kharaab kar rahe hai (khanan ghotaale ke aaropee bijepi ke reddy bandhu isi ilaake main rahete hai)
 Ballari disrespected the Congress due to its political selfishness
 hamaari raay:desh ke do diggaj dalon ke do sheersh netaa jab ek-duusare par bhrashtachar ke masale par hamalaa karte hai to tivi kaa vah purana vigyaapan yaad aata he, jisamen ek vyakti, duusare se kahata he, 'teri kameez meri kameez se safed kaise?'vaade tere vaderahul gandhi:apni kalyankari yojanaon kii vajah se karnataka duusare rajyon ke liye udhaaharan pesh kar rahaa he
 We have fulfilled more than 90% of the promises made in the year 2013
 ham basavanna ke siddhant kaa paalan karte hai
 Whatever promises will be made on this platform, everything will be fulfilled
 congress apane vaadon ko puraa karti he, jabaki piem modi isaki credit le rahe hai
 Narendra Modi: In the last election, the Congress had promised to make Nellikarjun Kharge the Chief Minister
 unhone dalit samudaay ko gumraah kiya he
 He sidelined Kharge
 congress aisi hi raajnneeti karti he
 Kalaburgi area is known for its pulse yield
 yahaan ke kisaanon ko centre kii yojanaon kaa phayda mil rahaa he, lekin karnataka sarkaar unke halaat ko lekar asamvedansheel he
 Our opinion: No party has fulfilled all its promises in the manifesto
 isliye piem modi or rahul gandhi donon karnataka sarkaar ke pradarshan ke maamle main apni suvidha ke mutabik sach bol rahe hai
 The people of Karnataka will take a final decision on this on 12 May
 mahila suraksharahul gandhi:'beti bachaao, beti padhaao' pahal kaa naam badalakar 'beti bachaao bijepi ke emele se' kar dena chahie
 Do not just give a speech, say something that has weight
 narendra modi:yah chunaav karnataka kaa bhavishya tay karegaa
 Do not think that this is just for the election of mlas
 yah mahilaon kii suraksha or kisaanon kii bhalaai ke liye he
 Our opinion: The issue of women safety is a matter of concern for the whole country
 bijepi shasit rajyon se lekar vampanth shasit kerala or congress shasit karnataka tak har jagah ladakiyon, mahilaon ke saath aparaadh hote hai
 All political parties have to work for it

 Hamid has never been out of Delhi before, so he was a little afraid to go to Paris, because he would have problems in understanding the language there, but his wife has increased his self-belief that there are no such occasions in life
 Meet and Hamid must go

 The shadow mystery about the life of Subhash Chandra Bose, the great hero of the Indian freedom struggle, has not been solved even after 68 years
 itnaa hi nahin aazaadee kii ladaai ke liye videshon main based bharatiyon se unhen daan main mili karodon rupee kii dhan sampatti kaa bhi koi ata pataa nahin he
 Born on 23 January 1897, Subhash Chandra Bose is said to have died in an alleged plane crash on 18 August 1945 in Taiwan's airplane, but this claim also has several contradictions
 subhash chandra bose ke jivan par pustak likhane vaale anuj dhar kaa kahana he ki sirf netaji ke bare main hi nahin, balki aazaadee kii ladaai ke liye unhen videshon main rahane vaale bharatiyon se daan main mili karodon rupee kii sampatti kaa bhi koi pataa nahin he
 Dhar in his book 'india's Biggest Cover Up' has alleged that some of the biggest people of the country 'looted' this wealth of Netaji and the Indian government took no action
 unhone likhaa he ki tokio main bhartiya mishan ke tatkaaleen pramukh or baad main lambey samay tak bhartiya rigerv bank ke governor rahe sar benegal rama raav ne is bare main chaar disambar 1947 ko bharat sarkaar ko suchit kiya tha, lekin unhen koi utsahjanak uttar nahin mila
 The book cites highly confidential documents from the Ministry of External Affairs, claiming that another mission chief KK Chettur was also instrumental in bringing the property matter to light
 netaji subhash chandra bose ke aahvaan par aazaadee kii ladaai ke liye videshon main based bharatiyon ne unhen karodon rupee kii sampatti daan main di thi
 It included diamond gems, gold, silver and cash
 dhar ne kai gopneey dastavejon or tasveeron ke hawaale se daawa kiya he ki netaji 1985 tak jivit the
 There are many stories about Netaji
 kai sadhu santon ne khud ke netaji hone kaa daawa kiya, lekin sachai kabhi sabit nahin ho pai
 The Taiwan government has revealed its record that on 18 August 1945, there was no plane crash over Taiwan
 netaji ke bare main hui jaanchon se bhi koi sachaai saamne nahin ai
 Colonel Habibur Rahman, who was accompanying Netaji at the time of the alleged plane crash in Taiwan, gave separate statements to SAI Nair, the information minister of the Azad Hind government, to Russian and American spies
 rahamaan ne kabhi kaha ki unhone netaji ke jalte hue kapade unke badan se utaare the to kabhi apane bare main kaha ki vah to khud is hawaii durghatana main behosh ho gaye the or unhen taipai ke ek aspataal main hosh aayaa
 Sometimes he gave the date of Netaji's funeral on 20 August and sometimes 22 August 1945
 rahasy se pardaa uthaane ke uddeshy se desh ke pratham pradhanmantri jawaharlal nehru dwaara shahanvaj khan ke netritv main april 1956 main banaai gai jaanch samiti ne vimaan haadase kii baat ko sach bataaya tha, lekin samiti main shaamil rahe netaji ke bade bhai suresh chandra bose ne is report ko maanane se inkaar kar diya or aarope lagaaya ki sachaai jaanboojhkar chhipaai ja rahi he
 The Justice GD Khosla Commission set up in July 1970 also gave a similar report as the Shahnawaz Committee
 iske baad netaji ke rahasy ke bare main jaanch ke liye teesraa ayog 1999 main gathit kiya gaya
 This Mukherjee Commission, in its report, completely rejected Netaji's death in the plane crash and stated the need for further investigation in the case
 aath navambar 2005 ko bharat sarkaar ko saunpi gai mukherjee ayog kii report 17 may 2006 ko sansad main pesh kii gai, lekin sarkaar ne is report ko maanane se inkaar kar diya
 In Pakistan, the two factions have always been face to face with Bhagat Singh

 Samina, a resident of Chalk, says that Bhagat Singh seems to be very influential and charismatic in the fight against the British
 che guaara kii tarah
 But in Pakistan such characters remained buried due to communal history
 5
 According to Lakht Pasha, Bhagat Singh should be called a martyr not only in India but also in Pakistan
 kyonki unki shahadat kisi nijee phaayde yaa dharm vishesh ke liye nahin thi
 Rather, they were hanged for the sake of backward and marginalized people

 In Noida, a Noida Sector-58 policeman has been arrested near Sector-63 by making fake tomato-chilli sauce in Delhi

 Foreign Ministry spokesman Ravish Kumar said, "india is disappointed by Pakistan's response to our detailed document about jaish-e-mohammed's involvement in the cross-border terror attack in Pulwama
" ''unhone kaha, ‘‘afsos kii baat he ki pakistan inkaar kiye ja rahaa he or yahaan tak ki pulavama (hamale) ko aatanki hamalaa maananaa se inkaar kar rahaa he

 Kumar said India was examining the documents handed over by Pakistan on the Pulwama attack
 unhone kaha ki islamabad ne apni sarajameen se sanchalit hone vaale aatankwaadiyon yaa aatanki sanghathanon ke khilaaf yadi kuch kiya bhi he, to vishwasaneey karrwai kaa byora saajha nahin kiya he
 "it is a known fact that the United Nations-declared terrorist organization jaish-e-mohammed and its leader Masood Azhar are in Pakistan," he said
 is baat ko haal hi main paak videsh mantri ne antarrashtriya media ke samaksh sweekaar kiya
 The spokesman said that Pakistan should take prompt, credible and authentic action against the terrorists and terrorist organizations operating from its land
 kumaar ne kaha ki pakistan ko 2004 main kiye us vaade kaa paalan karnaa chahie ki vah apni sarajameen kaa istemaal bharat ke khilaaf aatankwaad ke liye kisi bhi tarah nahin karne degaa

 BJP MLA from Indore Usha Thakur has given a big statement in the Fir JNU case on Tuesday
 vidhayak ne mahila diwas ke maukey par yojit ek kaarykram main kaha ki koi vyakti yadi aatankwaadi, naksalwadi or deshadrohi banataa he to uske liye uski maa jimmedaar he
 He said that his mother is also responsible for people like jnu's Kanhaiya who raised anti-national slogans
 kanhaiya kii maa ne use lori main deshbhakti nahin sikhaai

 haal hi main jiesti parishad ne nirmaanadhin afordable houseing properties par jiesti dar ko 8 fisadi se ghataakar 1 pratishat kar diya or anya under-construction properties gaiyr-afordable segment ke liye ise 12 fisadi se 5 fisadi kar diya gaya he
 However the new rates mean that developers can no longer avail input tax credit
 isamen aise project shaamil hai jinaki booking 1 april, 2019 se pehle ho gai ho
 The new rates will inevitably apply for the new project starting from April 1, 2019
 beete hafte vitt mantri arun jetali kii adhyakshata main council kii meeting main yah faisla liya gaya he
 This reduction in GST rates is a big gift for home buyers
 isse developers or kharidaar donon ko khushi manaane kaa mauka mila he
 At a time when there is a pressure situation in this sector, both on the demand and supply front
 developers ne makaan banakar taiyaar kar die hai, lekin bazaar main kharidaar nahin hai
 That is, there is a supply of houses, but there is a softening in its demand
 aise main sarkaar kaa yah kadam makaan kharidaaron ke saath-saath developers liye raahat bharaa he
 The meeting also changed the definition of affordable housing
 jiesti parishad ne ek property ko afordable houseing ke antargat shaamil hone ke liye isaki keemat adhiktam 45 lakh tak tay kii he
 Also, a 60 sq m (646 sq ft) carpet area has been earmarked in metro cities (delhi NCR, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, Bengaluru, Hyderabad) and 90 sq m (969 sq ft) elsewhere
 pehle yah dayera metro shaharon 50 varg meter tha
 Earlier the high GST rate on under-construction property meant that people preferred priority to ready-to-move in properties
 haalanki kam samay main agar ise dekhen to isse bikri or collection baadhit ho jayega, kyonki yah jiesti ke shuruaati dinon ke dauraan hua tha jo july, 2017 main lagu kiya gaya tha
 Pradeep Aggarwal, founder and chairman of real estate company Signature Global as well as chairman of the National Council on Affordable Housing, Assocham, says, "apart from the reduction in GST rates, when the definition of affordable housing was raised to Rs 45 lakh, this sector
 Has been proven to be a booster for
 kyonki ab is shrenee ke antargat adhik se adhik sampattiyaan shaamil hongi or is tarah badi sankhya main kharidaaron ko laabh degaa
 "some estimates say that there are around 6 lakh units under construction in the top seven cities, of which a large portion falls in the price range of Rs 40-45 lakh
 yah anumaan he ki graahakon ko un jagahon par adhik laabh hoga jahaan keemten lagbhag 6,000 rupe prati vargafoot hai
 (if the construction cost is between 2000-2300 rupees per square foot)
 saath hi kul kharid par kharidaaron ke bhugtan main lagbhag 7 pratishat kii kami hogi
 Deepak Kapoor, director of Gulshan Homz, states that, "many real estate companies have inventory that falls into this category and will attract the attention of buyers
 is kadam se nishchit rup se maang main tezi aayega
 Now we are expecting that the new GST rates coming into force from April 1, 2019 will increase the demand in the sector
 developers yah sunishchit karne ke liye teji se kaam karen ki ve project kii laagat or bikri mulya ko tay karne baad nai dar ko lagu karne ke liye taiyaar hai
 However, the biggest challenge will be to make customers aware of the revised pricing and explain the situation
 market kii maujuuda sthiti dekhte hue hamen nahin lagata ki gharon ke daam main baari badlaav aayega or ham yah apeksha karte hai ki yah badlaav puure real estate sector ke centiments par sakaaratmak prabhaav daalega
 "most developers have already bought raw material for projects started before April 1, 2019 and they are a little confused about GST charges to the buyer," says Rajesh Goyal, MD and CREDI NCR Vice President, RG Group
 Were
 ab developers raahat kii saans le sakate hai
 Now we are looking at a better market as the rates for new projects will be 5 percent and 1 percent
 iskaa matlab hoga ki adhik sankhya main log ab ghar kharidne kii koshish karenge
 "asr Delhi Delhi (NCR, Delhi, Noida, Greater Noida, Ghaziabad, Gurgaon, Faridabad) falls under Affordable Housing so sales will be seen here
" propatiger ke anusaar real estate developers chaalu vitt varsh kii antim timahi main noida main 30,000 se adhik ghar deliver karenge
 More than 94000 units are expected to be delivered in Yamuna Expressway and Noida Expressway areas in FY 2020
 isi tarah, gurugram main developers march ke ant main timahi ke dauraan lagbhag 24,000 houseing unit deliver kar sakate hai
 Of these, 12,300 units are at Dwarka Expressway and Sohna Market
 propatiger ke chif investment officer ankur dhawan kehete hai, 'haal ke dinon main ek trend dekha gaya ki nirmaanadhin projects bikri ke dhime daur se guzar rahe the
 With the new decision coming soon, we will see a boom in the real estate sector
 yah faisla realti sector ko ek nae daur kii ore le jaaenga jahaan projects kii ghoshnaa ke kuch dinon ke bheetar hi isko bechaa ja sakegaa
 Of course this will depend on the credibility of the developer and the location of the projects
 ”gaiyr-metro shaharon ke liye labhin shaharon main pehle se hi keemten pratispardhi maani jaati hai or jiesti main kami ke baad yahaan bikri badhane vaali he
 However, GST is not the only reason behind the success of the project in these cities as connectivity has increased and better infrastructure is also playing its role
 jiesti main kami se in jagahon par bazaar ko or badhaava milegaa
 The latest decision of the GST Council will force more and more buyers to buy their home in these cities
 khaskar dilli-ensiaar main jinka kharidaaron kaa bajet paryaapt nahin hai, ve in shaharon kii ore adhik aakarshith honge
 Kamal Taneja, MD, TDI Infracorp, says, "areas near Delhi such as Panipat, Bhiwadi and Kundli are already witnessing change
 “hamaare paas kundali main TDI city he jo pehle se hi dilli ke bahut kareeb he or dilli ke kai kharidaaron ne yahaan ghar kharide hai
 Recently the work of KMP has been completed and we are taking full advantage of it
 ab jiesti parishad kaa faisla bhi aa chukaa he
 This is definitely a good sign for the real estate sector
 ”ferewaylth group ke senior veepi, nipun gaba kehete hai, “ham hameshaa se bhiwadi se jude rahe hai jo dilli ke saath enech 8 ke madhyam se acchhee tarah connected he or yahaan daren bhi afordable hai
 When the Council's decision on GST reduction on affordable housing came, we were most happy because it would mean more savings for our respected buyers and more business for us
 hamen yakeen he ki bhiwadi main property ab tej gati se bikegi or kharidaaron ke saath-saath dilli ensiaar ke log yahan nivesh karenge, jo rashtriya rajdhani kshetra main ghar nahin bana sakate hai
 “the real estate sector feels that this decision will improve the sentiments of the customers as they will now show greater inclination towards the properties under construction resulting in improved sales in the coming years

 kii sahaayta dene ke liye isamen se 150 karod rupye kaa istemaal pehle hi kiya ja chukaa he
 But since the amount is still left, he says that the scheme will continue for the entire 2017-18 financial year

 Only 10 per cent of the funds of the fund has been utilized
 rajya vidhansabha main vipaksh ke netaa abdul mannaan kehete hai, ''makasad yah tha ki rajya vidhansabha main is baat kaa record rakhaa jayega ki bengal ke kuch logon ne is kadar ankahi mushkilen jheli thim ki unhen nakad sahaayta ke jariye raahat die jane kii jarurat thi
 It was nothing but dust in the eyes
 '' ve jor dekar kehete hai ki unke nirvachan kshetra main kisi ko bhi ek dhela nahin mila he
 Viswanath Chakraborty, professor of political science at Ravindra Bharti University, agrees, "the plan failed so much that legislators had to ask party workers to distribute money (to show the large number of beneficiaries)
" ''naam na chhapane kii shart ke saath trinmul congress ke ek vidhayak kehete hai ki rajya sarkaar kai prabhavit mazdooron se shaayad isliye haath dho baithi kyonki ve itane zyada dur chale gaye ki unase sampark bhi nahin kiya ja sakaa
 However, the farmers' scheme worked better
 krishi mantri poornendu bose kehete hai ki buree tarah prabhavit koi 10 lakh kisaanon ko sahaayta di gai taaki ve apni fasal ke karj or laagat ke kharch chukaa saken
 They point out that the aim was to save the farmers from getting caught in the debt trap
 ve yah bhi bataate hai ki pashchim bengal akelaa rajya tha jisane notebandi ke liye vishesh package kaa elaan kiya tha
 And now the Trinamool Congress, which is gearing up to fight the BJP in the panchayat elections, is hoping to use it to shine its 'pro-poor' and 'pro-farmer' image

 Interestingly, many of these folk artists are among those who take advantage of the government's public extension project scheme
 yahi nahin, mukhyamantri kaa iraadaa kuch or yojanaayen laane kaa bhi he

 Has reached dalit asmita ke sabase pavitra din yani buddha poornima par bahujan samaaj party pramukh mayawati ne party ke sabase puraane or bharosemand muslim chehre nasimuddin siddiki or unke bete afjal siddiki ko party se baahar kar diya
 Obviously, if Behenji has taken this difficult decision, then there will be some deep reasons, which Siddiqui and Mayawati would have known better
 jo vajahen donon pakshon ne saarvajanik bayanon main bataai hai, ve to bataai hi jaati hai
 After Siddiqui's ouster from the BSP, the first question that will arise is, what next political step will Nasimuddin take and how will his exit affect the politics of the BSP? But one more question arises from this eviction that Mayawati has removed her trusted soldier at a time when the soldiers of Indian politics, Napoleon Narendra Modi, are wandering all over the Shahdash to welcome the leaders of other parties to the BJP
 bhaajapa ne is kadar duusare netaaon ke liye party ke daravaaje khole hai ki kuch pradeshon main puri kii puri sarkaar hi bhaajapa main samaa gai
 On the other side is the Congress, which is not taking out the leaders in spite of thousands of troubles, even though its leaders are kissing the bjp's muscle one by one
 aise main agar mayawati bhi siddiki ko nikaalane ke bajaay ek asantusht netaa kii tarah party main bana rahane deteen to kya party ko apekshaakrit kam nuksaan nahin hota
 Those who say this may say that the bsp's vote is sustainable and the arrival of the leaders does not matter
 lekin ab pehle jaisi baat nahin rahi
 The BSP has been steadily eroding since its strong performance in the 2007 assembly elections and reaching the helm of power
 yaad kiijie 2012 ke vidhansabha chunaav se thik pehle mayawati apane kareeb ek darjan mantriyon ko party se nikaal chuki thim
 Some of these ministers were also accused of corruption
 in nikaale jane waalon main babu singh kushvaha bhi shaamil the
 There were some ministers who are now proudly ministers in the bjp's UP government
 us chunaav main basapa ne satta ganvaai or siten aadhi se kam rah gayi
 By 2017, he also removed Swami Prasad Maurya from the party
 maury ko bhi bijepi ne haathon-haath liya or ab ve bhi yogi sarkaar main mantri hai
 Dara Singh Chauhan, who was the leader of the BSP in the Lok Sabha in 2009, is now a minister in the Yogi government
 mayawati ke khaas maane jane vaale brajesh pathak bhi basapa chhodkar bhaajapa main aae or ab yogi sarkaar main mantri hai
 From Babu Singh Kushwaha to Maurya's farewell, there was a long queue of leaders drawn from the party and the direct effect of this was that the extremely backward class who had been associated with the BSP for three decades in Uttar Pradesh went to the BJP
 daliton kaa ek varg bhi bhaajapa main gaya
 Mayawati continues to empty her bundle of leaders in a particular kind of stubbornness, while her party is unable to produce new leaders
 abansimuddingaye hai to party ke saath jo musalmaan judaa tha, uskaa man kasaiyla ho gaya he
 The BSP can still say that they were not grassroots leaders and could not win the assembly elections on their own, but will the BSP be able to tell who is the Muslim face in the party that gave tickets to 100 Muslims in the 2017 assembly elections? If the bsp's 'bhima' mim ie 'M' has fallen from it, where will the party stand
 siddiki kii barkhaastagi ke saath hi party ke kai muslim netaaon ne party chhod di he
 Siddiqui has been taken out by the BSP at a time when on one hand the sp-congress is trying to bring Muslims fully with them, the BJP has put all its strength in bringing the Dalit voters with them
 agar mayawati ko lagata he ki bhaajapa uskaa dalit vot nahin tod paaegi, to yah unka mugalata he
 Mayawati should recall the phase of the rise of the BSP when three parties snatched Congress voters from three sides in one jolt and brought her 40-year-old power to UP
 tab bijepi ne agade, sapa ne pichde or musalmaan or basapa ne dalit vot khinchakar congress ko hatprabh kar diya tha
 By continuously weakening the BSP, Mayawati is pushing the party born of the silent revolution of Dalits into the politics of politics
 unhen yaad rakhana chahie ki ve daliton kii kitni bhi laadli kyon na hon, lekin is samay hinduon ke dil par modi kaa raaj he
 If Modi is opening the arms of the party to Dalits with love and respect, then a class can go there
 kyonki is varg ko bhi pataa he ki chunavi jeet ke liye kam se kam do virgon kii jarurat hoti he
 In such a situation, instead of being associated with the BSP, joining the BJP with respect is a guarantee of power
 mayawati ko ab yah jaan lenaa chahie ki ve netaaon ko nahin voter samoohon ko party se nikaal rahi hai
 He should also remember that during the assembly elections, there was a lot of rumor that BJP-BSP alliance would be formed after the election
 yah afvaah ateet main bhaajapa-basapa ke gathbandhanon ke tajurbe ke kaaran kuch zyada hi faili thi
 Now after the departure of Nasimuddin, the BSP leadership should not be surprised if rumors of BSP coming close to BJP again
 ummid karte hai ki agar buddha poornima par mayawati ne yah kadaa faisla kiya he to in sab andeshon par pehle hi vichaar kar liya hoga

 loksabhaa chunaav ke maddenjar upi main mayawati or akhilesh yadav ke netritv main sapa-basapa gathbandhan ne congress party ko bada jhatka diya he
 The bua-babua duo has not only shocked the Congress in the grand alliance exercise but also separated it from the SP-BSP alliance
 haalanki, is nae gathbandhan ne congress kii donon paramparaagat siton par apane ummidavaar nahin utaarne kaa elaan kiya he
 Mayawati and Akhilesh Yadav announced in a joint press conference that the SP and BSP will contest 38-38 seats in the Lok Sabha elections
 sapa-basapa gathbandhan ne chaar siten chhod di hai, jisamen do siten sahyogiyon ke khate main jaaegi vahiin, do siten congress ke liye chhod di gai hai, amethi or raibareli he
 Mayawati attacked both BJP and Congress fiercely during a shared press conference
 sapa-basapa gathbandhan main congress ko saath na rakhane par mayawati ne kaha ki bijepi kii tarah hi congress kii nitiyaan bhi bhrasht hai
 Corruption took place during the reigns of both BJP and Congress
 congress or bijepi donon kii niti ek jaisi hi bhrasht he or kagress ke saath jane par basapa ko vot share main nuksaan hota he
 The SP-BSP is not going to benefit much from going with the Congress
 hamanen apane anubhav ko hi tarjeeh di he
 With the Congress joining, our vote share has a bad effect
 agar ham inke saath nahin jate hai to hamaare paas vot kaa share zyada rahata he
 So we have kept the Congress out of the coalition for this reason
 haalanki hamaari party ne yah faisla liya he ki puure desh main congress party yaa is tarah kii kisi bhi anya party se gathbandhan karke chunaav nahin ladegi jisase hamaara vot hi cat jaae
 He said that there is an undeclared emergency in bjp's rule today
 bijepi ko is baar congress ko hui 1977 main hue chunaav kii tarah hi bada nuksaan hone vaala he
 Mayawati said that Congress government had gone because of Bofors, now BJP government will go because of Rafale
 rafel bijepi ko le duubegi
 Mayawati said that BJP has gained power in the state by dishonesty
 hamane gathbandhan main congress ko nahin rakhaa
 Whether Congress or BJP came, both have the same thing
 congress or bijepi kii nitiyaan ek jaisi he
 The condition of both governments has been the same
 agar ham congress se gathbandhan karte hai to hamen ghaataa hoga
 Because corruption happened during the Congress time also
 mayawati ne kaha ki upi main bijepi ne beimaani se sarkaar banaai he
 Will prevent anti-people from coming to power
 bijepi kii ahamkaari sarkaar se log pareshaan he
 Just like we have defeated the BJP in the by-elections, similarly we will defeat the BJP in the Lok Sabha elections
 isse pehle mayawati ne kaha kipiem modi or amit shah donon guru chele kii neend udaane vaali ati mahatvapurn or aitihaasik press conference hone ja rahi he
 Our party BSP has given momentum to Ambedkar's caravan after his death
 hamanen us kaaravaan ko aitihaasik safalataa bhi dilaai he
 We are working to honor the victims of the casteist system
 ham pehle bhi saath aae the or aaj phir chunaav ke liye saath aa rahe hai
 We had success in elections during that time also
 is baar bhi ham safal honge
 Our motive is only to keep communal parties like BJP out of power

 jab se nityanand desh chhodkar bhaaga he, tabhi se uski talash ho rahi he lekin ab pataa laga he ki usne ek desh bana liya he
 Nityananda has named this country 'kailasa', although it is not yet known in which corner of the world it is
 gujarat police ne 22 november ko hi nityanand kaa ahmedabad kaa ashram khangala tha, lekin vahaan kuch saamaan hi mila or kuch pataa nahin laga
 The Kailasa country created by Nityananda also has a website called Kailaasa

 It is written on the website that Kailasha is a country, which has been made for Hindus without any limitations
 ye unke liye he jo apane desh main hindu hone kaa adhikaar kho chuke hai’

 ise sanathan hindu dharm kii raksha karne ke liye banaaya gaya he
 This country of Nityananda has its own government, which has many departments whether it is home department or finance department
 nityanand ke desh 'kailasa' kii websitewebsite par likhaa gaya he ki unka mishan hindu dharm kii raksha karnaa or maanavtaa ke prati logon ko jaagruk karnaa he

 gujaratpulice kii ore se nityanandko dhundne kii koshish to kii ja rahi he, lekin sutron kii maane to abhi tak interpol se sampark nahin kiya gaya he
 Nityananda has made this Hindu nation by running away from the country

 Along with this, Hindu nation, Hinduism and many related things have been launched on the website

 lekin Exit Poll ke nateezon ko dekhakar vipakshi partiyon main khalabali much gai he
 On Tuesday, the leaders of 22 opposition parties met with the Election Commission on the issue of EVM and VVPAT
 in partiyon kii maang he ki 23 may ko voton kii ginati shuru hone se pehle matdaan kendron par VVPAT parchiyon kii jaanch kii jaae
 But the Election Commission brushed aside complaints of tampering with evms in the Strong Room
 partiyon kaa kahana he ki agar kisi booth par vivipieti parchiyon kaa milan sahi nahin miltaa to us vidhansabha kshetra ke sabhi matdaan kendron kii vivipieti parchiyon kii ginati kii jaae or unka milan iviem ke nateezon se kiya jaae
 Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad said after the meeting with the Election Commission that there is a possibility of EVM disturbances
 haalanki in sabhi khabaron par chunaav ayog ne viraam laga diya he
 The Election Commission said that evms and VVPAT machines in the Strong Room are completely safe
 chunaav main istemaal hone vaali mashiinon ko 23 may ko voton kii ginati se pehle nai mashiinon se badalane ke aaropon ko bhi chunaav ayog ne khaarij kar diya
 Taking notice of the complaints of machines being taken to polling booths and disturbances in their care, the Election Commission immediately sought an inquiry report from the district election officials of the states
 jaanch main saamne aayaa ki jin mashiinon kii shikaayat kii gai, unka voting ke dauraan istemaal kiya hi nahin gaya
 They were reserve machines
 agar matdaan ke dauraan mashiinon main dikkat aati he to rigerv mashiinon kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 The Election Commission has ruled out any possible disturbances after voting on complaints of misuse of evms after voting in Saran in Bihar, Dumariaganj, Chandauli, Ghazipur and Jhansi in UP
 chunaav ayog ne tivi or soshal media par chal rahe video ko galat bataaya or kaha ki inamen jo mashine dikhaai gai hai, unka istemaal chunaav main nahin kiya gaya
 The Election Commission said that evms and VVPAT machines are sealed after voting and they are kept under surveillance of CCTV cameras in the Strong Room
 ummidavaar or unke pratinidhi strong room ko kabhi bhi dekh sakate hai

 Hello, Ravish Kumar
 ek or kitaab aa rahi he isliye ek or vivaad aa gaya he
 After Sanjay Baru, Natwar Singh, PC Parikh, now the book of former Accountant General Vinod Rai is coming
 times naao ke arnab goswami se baat karte hue purv mahalekhaakaar yani sieji ne kaha he ki manmohan singh chaahate to 2-ji ghotaalaa roak sakate the tab upie−2 kaa itihaas hi kuch or hota
 Vinod Rai has told Arnab that during the meal meeting of the Public Accounts Committee of Parliament, the Congress mps told me that the Prime Minister's name should be excluded
 unka naam to yaad nahin aa rahaa, lekin 3−4 congress saansad the
 Then Vinod Rai takes the names of three mps that Sanjay Nirupam, Sandeep Dixit, Ashwini Kumar were present in the Public Accounts Committee meeting
 phir yah bhi kehete hai ki bhojan ke samay kisne kaha ki piem kaa naam na ho yaad nahin aa rahaa
 When who said no remember the name, was it appropriate to take someone's name? sanjay or sandip donon ne kaha he ki ve piesi ke sadsy tab bane jab sieji kii report aa chuki thi, lihaaza raay sahab jhooth bol rahe hai
 Vinod Rai is also saying that the report had come by then, then why were these mps saying that pm's name should not come
 ve aage kehete hai ki vinod raay ne kaha ki piemo se kisi ne nahin pradhanmantri kaa naam hataane yaa asar daalane ke liye dabaav nahin daalaa jabaki piemo main kai adhikari unke mitra or sahyogi the or ghar par aana janaa hota tha
