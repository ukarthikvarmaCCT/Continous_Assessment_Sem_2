 The IPL final was held in Kolkata on 25 May

 There was speculation that BCCI chief n Srinivasan would resign
 magar us shaam bengal cricket association ke chif or is handi ke sabase puraane chaaval jagmohan daalamia ke dinar main kuch aisa hua ki sari chaalen ulti pad gayi
 Jin Arun Jaitley and Rajiv Shukla were given the responsibility of persuading Srinivasan to resign
 vahi bhavar main funs gaye
 Srinivasan said that if i have a moral responsibility, then both of you
 istipha denge, to sab denge
 Not only this, Srinivasan even talked about holding fresh elections
 iske baad hawa kaa rukh ulat gaya
 Meanwhile, some members also asked Dalmiya to help revolt
 magar unhone health kharaab hone kaa hawala dekar philhal is mahabharat main parde ke peeche rahanaa hi tay kiya he
 Only after this meeting, Srinivasan, who was convinced afresh, said in the press conference that i will not let anyone forcibly take away my post
 kya hua daalamia ke dinar menkolkata ke ek paanch sitara hotel main hue is dinar main board ke aalaa adhikari or 27 member bulaae gaye the
 But many active members like bjp's Yuva Morcha president Anurag Thakur stayed away from it
 tab tak agle president ke taur par bijepi netaa or board main dilli kii numaaindgi karne vaale arun jetali kaa naam bhi chalane laga tha
 a plan was made to overcome the trouble with the help of his grip on the law and the capital of prestige gathered as the leader of the opposition in the state
 magar jetali lig se jude logon par lage karpshan ke aaropon or is par party ke stand ke chalate khulkar saamne nahin aa rahe the
 Shashank Manohar, the previous head of the board, was also named for some time
 magar tark aayaa ki pichley do saal se vah board or cricket se dur hai
 In such a situation, it felt far-fetched
 baharhaal, dinar main kul 17 state unit ke member pahunche
 In the initial conversation, everyone made it clear that neither cricket nor the institution is in the interest of the current events and the allegations that led to it
 sanket sabhi kii taraf se saaf the ki shrinivasana ko naitik jimmedaari lete hue istipha de dena chahie
 But the question arose as to who should ring the bell around Billoute's neck
 yahaan par virodh ke liye netritv kii talash shuru hui
 It also reached the IPL Chairman, Union Minister Rajiv Shukla and BJP leader Arun Jaitley
 jetali ipel kii gavarning council ke sadsy hai
 Both sparked debate and explained to Srinivasan that things would go well with his resignation
 khije shrinivasana ne tab kaha, ki thik he, main pad chhod detaa hum
 But both of you also have moral responsibility
 to aap donon ko bhi istipha dena hoga
 According to the sources, Srinivasan, who came in a rage, even said that if such cleanliness and clean image is being talked about, why not mass resignation and fresh elections
 ye sunate hi board ke zyaadaatar members sakate main aa gaye
 If the leader is not found, then Srinivasan is still left, even after the revolt stopped, it is also due to lack of leadership for the rebellion in the board full of leaders
 agar shrinivasana istipha nahin dete, to board ke samvidhan ke mutabik ek or vikalp tha unhen hataane kaa
 For this, 10 board members were to be signed and petitioned to call an urgent meeting of the board in view of the prevailing situation
 uskaa agenda bhi saaf hona tha ki is meeting kaa makasad board president ko hataanaa he
 If two-thirds of the members approved it in the meeting, Srinivasan's stand was fixed
 magar sawaal phir vahiin atka tha
 Who will be those 10 heroes? koi bura nahin bananaa chahta tha
 Everyone had their own strategic and economic arithmetic
 jetali or shukla maan manuval tak to aage dikhe, magar is tareeke ke apnaane par unki bhi sahmati nahin hui
 The biggest drawback to this strategy was the lack of alternative leadership
 mana ja rahaa tha ki shrinivasana ke jane ke baad purv cricketer shivlal yadav kaman sanbhaalenge
 But in the current situation, his coronation was not considered a right bet
 iske baad hi tay hua ki philhal intjaar kiya jaae or board kam se kam bahari taur par ekajute najar aae
 BCCI Secretary Ajay Shirke has responded to the letters of the Lodha Committee saying that the governing body of Indian cricket cannot prevent state units from conducting their elections
 bengal cricket sangh (cab) or karnataka rajya cricket sangh (keessie) ke chunaav nirdhaarit taarikh par nahin ho paae kyonki ucchtam nyaayalay dwaara niyukt panel ne patr bhejkar bisisiai ko sanghon ko suchit karne ke liye kaha ki sabhi rajya ikaayiyon ke chunaav roak die jaaen
 This came after the Supreme Court ruling on 18 July as the reformist steps would be implemented in the next six months

" saath hi lodha samiti kii siforishein bisisiai ko adhikrut nahin karti ki vah un nagarikon ke vaidhanik or moolbhoot adhikaron main hastkshep karen jo aise sanghon ke sadsy hai

 The source said, "yes, Ajay Shirke has replied to the letter sent to the BCCI officials
 shirke ne apane jawaab main kaha he ki bisisiai sanghon ko chunaav karaane se nahin roak saktaa lekin kisi ne bhi bisisiai ko sanghon ko chunaav karaane se rokane ko nahin kaha

 It is clear that all the decisions of Bihar Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi are going to harm Nitish Kumar

 There is only benefit
 maanjhi jediu or nitish ko jitna zyada nuksaan pahunchaayenge, sidhaa phayda bijepi ko hi hona he
 Manjhi is constantly hoping for help from the BJP, but the BJP is compelled that she is unable to support Manjhi openly due to her upper caste vote bank
 paswanon ko mahadaliton main shaamil kar maanjhi kii koshish nitish ko sabase zyada nuksaan pahunchane kii he
 Due to his Mahadalit agenda, Nitish created new equations in Bihar and this social engineering was considered to be the iron
 ab isse maanjhi kii jholii main jo bhi aayega uskaa phayda bijepi ko milanaa to tay he
 The loss of Nitish from Manjhi's footsteps is a direct benefit of the BJP
 ab maanjhi alag party banaakar yaa ram vilaas paswan kii lok janashakti party main shaamil hokar [agar aisa sambhav hua to] endie kaa hissaa ban sakate hai

 The bill, which provides for reservation in promotion to Scheduled Castes and Tribes people doing government jobs, could not be passed in Lok Sabha due to strong opposition from SP and BJP members for different reasons
 rajyasabha is vidheyak ko paarit kar chuki he
 While SP members, who have been opposing reservation in promotion since the beginning, shouted slogans against the bill, the BJP fiercely protested in the name of lack of order in the House and not giving its senior leader LK Advani an opportunity to speak
 Shouted slogans
 hangaame ke kaaran sadan kii baithak 6 baar ke sthagan ke baad antat: anischitkaal ke liye sthagit kar di gayi
 Soon after the Question Hour, Speaker Meira Kumar asked Minister of State for Personnel v Narayanasamy to present the Constitution 117th Amendment Bill 2012 for consideration
 lekin narayansami jaise hi bolne ke liye khadey hue, sapa sadsy asana ke saamne aakar vidheyak ke khilaaf narebaaji karne lage
 They were shouting slogans, 'reservation will not work in promotion
 ' is dauraan sapa pramukh mulaayam singh yadav bhi apane sthaan par khadey hokar virodh jataate najar aae
 The BJP voted in favor of the bill in the Rajya Sabha
 lekin baad main is vidheyak ko lekar party main kuch matbhed najar aae
 Party mps Maneka Gandhi and Yogi Adityanath made open comments against the bill outside Parliament
 menka ne daawa kiya ki uttar pradesh se bijepi kaa koi bhi saansad is vidheyak ke paksh main nahin hai
 Narayanasamy read nothing from the copy of the bill on Thursday but went on speaking fluently
 buudhvaar ko vidheyak pesh karte samay unase espi sadsy yashavir singh ne vidheyak chin liya tha
 Narayanasamy stood in the second row while the bill was being snatched, but on Thursday he began to speak about the bill from the sixth line and the members of the ruling party were sitting next to him
 jis samay espi sadsy asana ke saamne narebaaji kar rahe the, bijepi sadasyon ne khadey hokar asana se kaha ki jab sadan main vyavastha nahin he to samvidhan sanshodhan pesh nahin kiya ja saktaa
 BJP members told Asan, 'you are following the wrong tradition
 yah sansadeey niyamon kaa ulanghan he
 When the uproar did not stop, BJP Parliamentary Party chief LK Advani stood up to speak, but the slogans of the SP members continued
 narebaaji ke bich hi adhyaksh ne vidheyak par pehle vaktaa ke rup main congress ke piel puniya kaa naam pukaara
 Amidst the uproar, Punia continued to speak, but BJP members resented that it was not right to discuss important legislation like constitution amendment if there was no system in the house
 is bare main adwani kuch kahana chaahate the lekin unhen mauka nahin mila
 When the meeting of the House started at two o'clock in the afternoon after two brief adjournments due to the uproar, the SP as well as the BJP members came in front of the seat and shouted, 'such insult to the opposition will not go on, it will not do
 ’ espi sadsy padonnati main aarakshan ke khilaaf narebaaji karte rahe
 Meanwhile, Congress members also came in the front lines and started shouting 'we want reservation'
 rajyasabha main vidheyak kaa samarthan karne vaali bijepi vidheyak par vichaar ke liye samay chaahati thi
 He argued that this is not a real bill because it has been amended
 hangaamaa thamata na dekh adhyaksh ne sadan kii baithak dopaher do baje tak ke liye sthagit kar di
 Earlier, when the House was adjourned, Science Technology Minister s Jaipal Reddy was seen talking to Advani and Leader of Opposition Sushma Swaraj
 donon ne mulaayam se bhi baat kii
 After this, Congress President Sonia Gandhi went and informed about the conversation
 duusari ore sansadeey kaary mantri kamalnath, doorsanchaar mantri kapil sibbal or congress kii girija vyas bhi mulaayam se baat karte dekhe gayi
 BJP members were also seen urging Mulayam to control his members so that Advani could make his point
 jab bijepi kii baat mulaayam ne ansuni kii, to bijepi ke anant kumaar unhen yah kehete sune gaye ki agali baar jab vah (mulaayam) bolne ke liye khadey honge, to unhen bolne nahin diya jayega
 The slogans and uproar of the SP and BJP members continued when the meeting started at 2 pm and the house was adjourned till 2:30 pm
 dhai baje sadan kii baithak shuru hone par bhi espi sadasyon kaa hangaamaa or narebaaji jari rahi
 On the other hand, BJP members also started shouting slogans in front of the seat, protesting that senior BJP leader LK Advani was not given an opportunity to speak
 iske chalate baithak kuch hi minute baad teen baje tak ke liye sthagit kar di gayi
 Former India off-spinner Ramesh Powar has been made the interim coach of the national women's cricket team
 bisisiai jab tak tushaar arothe kaa upyukt vikalp nahin dhundh letaa, tab tak vah team ke saath jude rahenge
 Arothe was forced to resign after differences with senior players
 senior khilaadi baroda ke is purv olerounder ke koching ke tareekon se khush nahin thi
 Powar will join the women's team camp, which starts in Bengaluru from July 25
 bisisiai pehle hi purnakalik coach ke liye aavedan aamantrit kar chukaa he, jisaki antim taarikh 20 july he
 "I am not good at removing the coach at the behest of the players," Arothe said
 ’chalis saal ke powar ne bharat kii ore se do test main chah, jabaki 31 ekadivasiy antarrashtriya maichon main 34 wicket hasil kiye
 He took 470 wickets in 148 matches in first-class cricket
 pataa chalaa he ki powar ko apni antarim niyukti kii jaankaree cricket board se ravivaar ko mili
 Last week itself, Powar lost to former Mumbai wicketkeeper batsman Vinayak Samant in the race for the coach of Mumbai's senior Ranji team

 Every river has a story
 swarnarekha nadi ke paas bhi he
 This river of Jharkhand is called Jeevandayini in the same way as every other river is called in every area
 par jharkhand kii yah nadi, apane naam ke mutabik hi sach main sona ugalati he
 This story is so deeply rooted in the locality of Ranichuan near Nagadi, the village near the origin of the Swarnarekha, that the Pandavas were coming here at the time of their unknown, hence the name of the village is Pandu
 khaas baat yah he ki swarnarekha ke udgam kaa naam rani chuaan isliye padaa kyonki ekbar jab is nirjan ilaake main rani draupadi ko pyaas lagi to arjuna ne baan markar isi sthal se pani nikaala tha, jo aaj bhi maujuud he
 Over time, the river became named Swarnarekha
 vaise bhi myth sach yaa jhooth ke daayre se vah thode baahar hote hai
 It is not known how true is the story of the village of Pandu, the unknown of Pandavas and the story of Rani Chuan created from Arjuna's arrow? But it is not a myth that the Swarnarekha is like the Ganges of Jharkhand and like the Ganges, it has become more thrilling and depressing
 par swarnarekha nadi se sona nikalataa jarur he, par yah koi nahin jaanata ki isamen sona aata kahaan se he
 Due to the presence of gold coins in the Swarnarekha River, this river is of special importance to the goldsmiths of this region
 kinvadanti he ki is ilaake par raaj karne vaale nagvanshi raajaaon par jab mughal shaskaon ne akraman kiya to nagvanshi rani ne apane svarnabhushanon ko is nadi main pravaahit kar diya, jiske tej dhar se aabhushan swarnakanon main badal gaye or aaj bhi pravaahman he
 Even today, if you go, you will see women standing everywhere in the river for soup
 ilaake ke kareeb aadha darjan gaanvon ke parivaar is nadi se nikalne vaale sone par nirbhar hai
 People from villages like Kadrudih, Purananagar, Nodhi, Tulasih are extracting gold from this river for generations
 pehle yah kaam in gaanvon ke purush bhi karte the, lekin aamadani kam hone se purushon ne anya kaamon kaa rukh kar liya, jabaki mahilaayein parivaar ko aarthik madad dene ke liye aaj bhi yahi karti hai
 Those who extract gold everyday from the sand of the river should be rich? But it is not so
 halaat yahi he ki dinabhar sona chaanane waalon ke haath itane paise bhi nahin aate ki parivaar paal saken
 Every woman filtering gold from the river extracts gold equivalent to one or two grains of rice in a day
 ek maheene main kul sona kareeb ek se dedh gram hota he
 Every day a local moneylender buys a rice equivalent of 80 grams of gold from a woman
 vah bazaar main ise kareeb 300 rupye tak main bechata he
 Every woman earns up to Rs 5,000 a month by selling gold
 395 kilometre lambii yah barsaati nadi desh kii sabase choti antarraji (kai rajyon se hokar bahane vaali) nadi he jiske basin kaa kshetrafal kareeb 19 hajaar varg kimi he
 It flows through Ranchi, seraikela-kharsawan, East Singhbhum, West Medinipur (west Bengal) and Balasore (odisha)
 par jaankaron kaa kahana he ki yah nadi ab sookhne lagi he or iske udgam sthal par yah ek naala hokar rah gai he

 is nadi kii basin main kai tarah ke khanij hai
 We have already mentioned gold
 par in sabane nadi kii surat bigaad di
 Mining and metal processing industries have also started polluting the river
 ab nadi ke pani main gharelu or audyogic apshishton ke saath-saath radioskriy tatwon kii maujuudagi bhi he
 Especially, the ores flowing from open mines are holding the breath of this river
 odisha ke mayurbhanj or singhbhum jilon main desh ke tamba nikshep sabase adhik hai
 According to a study done in 2016 by Giri and other scientists, there is metallic pollution in the river Suvarna Rekha
 ab nadi or isaki sahaayak nadiyon main avaidh ret khanan teji par he
 This has endangered the ecology of the river
 is nadi basin ke madhyavarti ilaake main uranium ke nikshep he
 You must have heard the name of Jadugar, famous for uranium mines
 media reports ke mutabik, radioskriy tatv is khadaan ke teling pond se bahakar nadi main aa rahe hai
 The entire sewage of Jamshedpur city, which is the largest city in this river basin, falls directly into the river
 or ab iske pani main oxigen kii maatra ghatati ja rahi he or nadi ke pani main biological oxigen demand (biodi) tay maanak se adhik ho gaya he, jabaki biological oxigen demand maanak se kam hona chahie
 When the Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board conducted a test of the water sample of the Swarnarekha River, it was found that the quantity of oxygen in the water was found to be low in most places
 sthiti yah he ki swarnarekha nadi kaa pani jaanwaron or machhliyon ke liye surakshit nahin he
 Quantity of biological oxygen demand in water for animals and fish 1
 2 milligram se kam honi chahie, jabaki 7
 Is up to 0 mg per liter
 isaki vajah se kaaphi sankhya main machhliyaan nadi main mar rahi hai iske saath hi saath jaanwaron ko bhi kai tarah kii bimaariyaan ho rahi hai
 The confluence of the Swarnarekha and Kharkai rivers is just near Jamshedpur and here you can see the slugs from the iron ore factories
 haalanki, bhaajapa netaa (ab baagi) sarayu raay ne 2011 main ise lekar janhit yachika daayar kii thi, or tab tata steel ne jawaab main kaha ki yah slog shahar kii janata ko swarnarekha kii baadh se bachaane ke liye jamaa kiya gaya he
 The High Court had asked Tata to clean the place
 haalanki is par hui karrwai kii taaja khabar nahin he
 Small and large industrial units, iron smelting furnaces, coal washeries and mines in this area have made the river difficult
 baharhaal, kheti, paryaton or dharmik-aadhyatmik centre ke nazariye se sambhaawanaaon se bhare swarnarekha nadi main udgam se lekar muhane tak, is ilaake main pandavon se lekar chutia nagpur ke nagvanshi raajaaon se jude mithkon kaa prabhaav kam or hakeekat ke afsane zyada sunai padate hai

 Hello to all you beautiful people out there! This Monday, i want to talk to you about miracles
 At @thedivayoga and @sarvayogastudios, we truly do believe in miracles
 But miracles don't happen overnight, they take time, they take effort and they need for us to be open, but they are not impossible
 Speaking of miracles, here is a variation of the Chamatkarasana, which helps us do just this! It truly is a miracle asana, which helps in both physical and psychological benefits
 1
 It meticulously combines the back bend and single hand balance
 2
 Physically, it opens the chest, shoulders and throat
 3
 Opens the hips and hip flexors
 4
 Stretches and strengthens the back
 5
 It cultivates feelings of universal love and acceptance
 Here's my gratitude message for you today, "may all beings everywhere be happy and free, and may the thoughts, words, and actions of my own life contribute in some way to that happiness and to that freedom for all
" ”hello Universe, Hello new week! @sarvesh_shashia post shared bymalaika Arora(@malaikaaroraofficial) onsep 15, 2019 at 11:21pm pdtview this post on instagramas James Broughton said, “i’m happy to report, the child in me is still ageless” Started learning advance yoga at 42
 
 
 rather late, but better late than never
 i always wanted to do the # vrischikasana
 i believe it's never too late to learn something new
 Years may wrinkle the skin (that I’m okay with), but to give up enthusiasm will wrinkle my soul
 
 
 that i couldn't live with
 We don’t grow old with the number of years we live, we age when we stop living
 
 
 So Live it up # instafam
 Never give up

 The arrest of independent journalist Prashant Kanaujia over the alleged objectionable post against Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has been challenged by his wife Jagisha Arora
 is maamle main mangalvaar ko sunwaayee hogi
 Prashanth's wife Jagisha Kanaujia has filed a 'habeas Corpus' petition in the Supreme Court
 yachika main kaha gaya he ki prashanth kii giraftaar gaiyrkanoonee he or upi police ne is sambandh main naa to FIR ke bare main jaankaree di he naa hi giraftaar ke liye koi guideline kaa paalan kiya he
 He was also not produced before any magistrate for transit remand in Delhi
 saath main is baat kii bhi daleel di gai he ki FIR main IPC kii dhara 500 lagaai gai he jo police nahin laga sakati ye magistrate hi laga saktaa he
 Two streams are guaranteed
 aapako bataa den ki shanivaar subah dilli main uttar pradesh police dwaara mandavali sthit unke ghar se hiraasat main liya gaya tha
 Police said on Saturday that an FIR was lodged against journalist Prashant Kanaujia at Hazratganj police station on Friday night by a sub-inspector
 isamen aarope lagaaya gaya he ki aaropee ne mukhyamantri ke khilaaf ‘‘aapattijanak'' tippanee kii or unki chhavi dhoomil karne kaa prayaas kiya
 When contacted by pti-language, a senior police officer initially said that the journalist has been arrested
 haalanki adhikari ne baad main spasht kiya ki abhi tak koi giraftaar nahin kii gai he
 The officer said that the police is trying to interrogate the journalist
 kanaujia ne ek video tivetor or fasebuk par share kiya tha, jisamen ek mahila mukhyamantri karyaalay ke baahar vibhinn media sanghathanon ke samvaadadaataaon se baat karti dikh rahi he
 The woman is claiming that she has sent the marriage proposal to the Chief Minister
 kanaujia ke tivetor handle par likhaa he ki vah iiemasi or mumbai vishvavidhyalay ke chaatr rah chuke hai or kuch media sanghathanon se jude hai
 The Supreme Court has categorically warned Sahara Group chief Subrata Roy Sahara that he would be sent back to jail if he did not pay Rs 600 crore by the due date of 6 February
 court ne saaf shabdon main kah diya he ki 6 farvari, 2017 takasahaara grupako 600 karod rupee jamaa karnaa hi hoga, agar dedline tak paise nahin jamaa karte hai to phir subrat roy ko jail janaa hoga
 Subrata Roy was given six February time to deposit Rs 600 crore
 supreme court ne sebi vivaad main sahaara samooh kii yachika kii sunwaayee ke baad ye faisla sunaaya
 Last week, a fresh plea was filed by the Sahara Group requesting an early hearing, which the court gave today
 darasal sahaara samooh ne court main yachika daayar kar maang kii thi ki paisa jamaa karaane ke liye use or vakt diya jaae, kyonki notebandi kii vajah se paisa jutaney main dikkatein aa rahi hai
 However, if the news is to be believed, the court has refused to accept any such argument of Sahara
 gauratlab he ki 28 november, 2016 ko supreme court ne sahaara pramukh subrat roy ko jail se baahar rahane ke liye 6 farvari, 2017 tak 600 karod rupee jamaa karaane kaa nirdesh diya tha
 Earlier on 25 October, the Supreme Court extended Subrata Roy Keparolco till 28 November, when Sahara deposited Rs 200 crore with Sebi
 vahiin tihaad jail main kareeb 2 saal bitaane ke baad subrat roy saal 2016 ke may maheene main baahar aa the, jab unki maa kaa nidhan ho gaya tha
 Later his parole was extended on the condition that he would keep depositing funds with SEBI from time to time to return the money to investors
 pashchim bengal ke veerbhum jile main guuruuvaar ko ek bas main kathith taur par bina tikat yatra karne par pakade gaye ek yuvak ko police ne hiraasat main le liya

 tippaniyan Police said Sheikh Yasin, a resident of Nannur in Virbhum district, was taken into custody in the afternoon

 thakare ne kaha, 'iske baavjood agar sthaneey bijepi netaa madhyavadhi chunaav ke bare main charchaa karte rahe, to unhen ek baar aisa karnaa chahie
 They may not have been aware of their party president's stand on the issue
 ' thakare ne kaha, 'agar mukhyamantri (devendra fadanvis) kehete hai ki agar shivasena samarthan waapas leti he to bijepi kaa samarthan karne ke liye anek adrishy haath honge to unhen is baat ko dhyaan main rakhana chahie ki afvaah failaana or andhvishwaas maharashtra main aparaadh he
 ' (input agency se) Thackeray said, 'even if the local BJP leaders continue to discuss the mid-term elections, they should do it once
 ho saktaa he ki ve is mudde par apane party adhyaksh ke rukh ke bare main nahin jaanate hon
 Thackeray said, "if the Chief Minister (devendra Fadnavis) says that if Shiv Sena withdraws support then there will be many invisible hands to support BJP, then they should keep in mind that spreading rumors and superstition is a crime in Maharashtra 
 ' (from input agency) jammu-kashmir main amarnath yatra par buree najar rakhane vaale aatanki pichley 17 saalon main jo nahin kar paae wo unhone 10 july ko kar diya
 Not only did he fearlessly target the pilgrims' bus but also escaped after the attack
 or sirf bas ko nahin, police javaanon par bhi hamalaa kiya
 The entire country including the Prime Minister condemned this cowardly act
 atake ke peeche jahaan yatriyon kii laaparvaahee ko jimmedaar tehraaya gaya, vahiin sarkaar ne is karatuut ko aatankiyon kii hataasha qaraar diya
 But the reality is that weeds have been lost in many homes
 kisi ke sir se maa kaa saaya uth gaya to kisi ne apane bete, bhai or pita ko ganvaa diya
 So, should this attack be considered the frustration of the terrorists? darasal, is daawey ke peeche daleel ye he ki kashmir main aatank ke khilaaf modi sarkaar sakhti se pesh aa rahi he
 The worsening situation in the valley is also being seen as a reaction to this
 magar pichley kuch vakt main aatankiyon kii karatuut par najar daalen, to darasal aisa lagata he ki wo hataash nahin hai, unke hausale bade hai
 They are constantly being able to execute their nefarious plans
 surakshabalon se sidhi muthbhed to kar rahe hai, unke base campon main bhi ghuskar waar karne kii jurrat kar rahe hai
 Pathankot Airbase Attack On January 2, 2016, at 3:30 am, terrorists attacked the Airforce base in Pathankot, Punjab
 muthbhed main 7 jawan shahid ho gaye or 37 log ghayal ho gaye
 However, all the attacking terrorists were also killed
 magar aatankiyon ke paas baari maatra main asalha barood maujuud tha
 Even terrorists brought weapons like An-47
 jisase sawaal uthta he ki kya seemaa paar se hathiyaaron kii supplai par sarkaar roak lagane main naakaam rahi he
 Uri attack On September 19, 2016, there was a suicide attack on the army base camp at Uri in Jammu and Kashmir
 is hamale main sena ke 17 jawan shahid ho gaye
 However, the army also killed the four terrorists who came to attack
 in aatankiyon ke paas se pakistan kii marking vaala saamaan baraamad hua
 Four ak-47s and grenades were recovered from the militants
 itnaa hi nahin unke paas aag lagane vaale hathiyaar bhi maujuud the
 That is, it was once again proved that the terrorists came from across the border, brought weapons from there, brought medicines and other goods from there and managed to target the army base camp by entering into the Indian border
 pulavama-sopor main silsilewar hamalejammu-kashmir ke pulavama or sopor main isi saal 13 june kii raat aatankiyon ne surakshabalon ke campon ko nishaanaa banaaya
 Attacked 6 camps, not just one or two
 pehla hamalaa-pulavama jile ke traal main siarpief camp ke andar grenade phenkaa gaya
 Nine soldiers and an officer were injured in the attack
 doosraa hamalaa-pulavama jile ke padagampora main siarpief camp par grenade se hamalaa hua
 Third attack - Grenade was thrown at police station in Pulwama at 9 pm
 is dauraan kareeb 15 minute tak police or aatankiyon ke bich firing hoti rahi
 Fourth attack - CRPF camp at Sarnal in Pahalgam was attacked with grenades
 haalanki is hamale main koi nuksaan nahin hua
 Fifth Attack - Grenade attack on army camp at Pajalpura, Sopore
 is hamale main kisi ke hataahat hone kii koi khabar saamne nahin ai he
 That is, the terrorists targeted 6 camps of security forces on the same night
 unke paas na sirf aadhunik hathiyaar the, balki unki sankhya bhi itani thi ki silsilewar tareeke se 6 hamalon ko anjaam diya
 This shows that terrorists funding and infiltration could not be curbed somewhere
 haalanki, ajtak ke sting oparation ke baad enie ne funding ke aarope main kai algaavvaadi netaaon par shikanja ksaa he
 Talking about the recent attack on Amarnath pilgrims, it has been learned from government sources that the terrorists had left their informants, who were following the pilgrims' vehicles with which the convoy of security forces is not present
 yani aatankiyon ne is hamale ke liye apane over ground network kaa istemaal kiya
 Because the terrorists attacked the bus within 50 minutes of the removal of the security cover, it is evident that the communication network of the terrorists is also very strong in the valley
 is sabake bich sena ne haal hi main ghati main maujuud aatankiyon kii ek list taiyaar kii he
 On the basis of the list, the army has started 'operation Clean Sweep' to eliminate terrorists
 bhartiya sena lagaataar is disha main kaam kar rahi he or sabjar bhatta jaise aatank ke bade chehron ko jameendoj kiya ja chukaa he
 However, the issues on which the leaders of the current government used to call the first government a failure, such as terrorist funding, infiltration and arms supply, are seen to be moving forward in increasing their nefarious plans

 'gupta claimed,' a client should give all the information, right or wrong, good or bad, to the lawyer, but i was kept in the dark and i got all the details related to the case from outside (media)
 ' When he was asked whether he changed his mind after a case was registered against Rahul? He then replied, 'the FIR has nothing to do with this decision
 ek vakil hameshaa aisi chizon ke liye taiyaar rahata he
 ' gauratlab he ki rahul abhi aspataal main bhartee hai

 There is no way back in the election campaign that candidates are adopting unique methods for campaigning and among these methods the recommendations of Lyngdoh are being openly violated
 koi pataakhon kii ladiyon ke shor ke bich vot maang rahaa he, to koi hammer or lamborgini jaisi lakjri kaaron ko shokes kar chaatro ko aakarshith kar rahaa he
 Somewhere there is an era of sloganeering, and somewhere activists are campaigning in the campus by plying with cars
 koi sarkas se lambey vishalkay kartab dikhaane vaala laayaa he, to koi alag-alag karactor ke cartoon
 This is the electoral color of Dusu, who is speaking with the heads of student organizations

 Nobody wants to be behind anyone in campaigning
 yahi vajah he ki campus kii deevaaron se lekar khambe tak ummidavaaron or chaatr sanghathanon ke binar-poster se pate hue he

 lekin abivipi ke ummidavaaron ke mutabik ye virdohi dalon kii sajeesh he, to vahiin enesayuai ise samarthakon kaa josh bataa kar pallaa jhaad rahi he
 The way of publicity is not available to the students, the method of campaigning of the Dusu candidates is not too much for the students, so some students are also thinking of not voting

 com / kbyjprktjz kathmandu ke tribhuvan airport par bahut hi bheed bhaad kaa alam he
 Relief workers from all over the world including India are reaching here
 ve apane saath badi maatra main khanepine kii chizein, dawaaen, tent, kambal aadi lekar aa rahe hai
 All this is different from government aid coming from different countries
 lekin inamen se bhi zyaadaatar raahat saamagree airport par hi jamaa kara lee jaati he
 That is because the government wants to distribute it through its government system
 tark ye he ki isse raahat saamagree sahi main zaruuratmand logon tak pahonchegi
 It will not remain confined in a few hands
 is sarkari niyam ke apane phaayde hai to nuksaan bhi
 The government system is not big enough and agile to reach every remote area devastated by earthquake
 lihaaza airport or sarkari godaamon main raahat saamagree kaa ambara lagane laga he jabaki sudoorvarti ilaaqon ke bukamp peedit raahat kii raah dekh rahe hai
 Some foreign relief workers who are bringing relief material as their registered baggage are able to carry it out with them
 kathmandu ke sthaneey logon ne helping hand naam se ek swayamsevi sanstha banaayi he jo is tarah sidhe pahunche raahat saamagree ko doordaraj ke ilaaqon main pahunchane main jute hai
 The need is greater and direct support from outside is not reaching such institutions
 lihaaza inhone khud saamagree ikattha karnaa shuru kiya he
 a large number of people are coming forward to help
 khaastaur par nepal ke vyapaariyon kaa tabaka isamen dil khol kar jute gaya he
 The comments aisi koshishon kii khabar jaise-jaise fail rahi he, log khud bhi gadiyon main saamaan lad kar sanstha tak pahunchaa rahe hai
 a volunteer associated with the organization does not want to give his name but says that the government should seek our help
 ham harek daan or saamaan kaa record rakh rahe hai
 The full picture of the relief material coming and to reach the needy is also being uploaded
 sarkaar chaahe to apane kuch niyam tay kar de lekin raahat saamagree baantne main hamaari madad le
 We are also providing help in areas where it is not possible to go by trains
 ham paidal chal kar vahaan pahunch rahe hai
 It is to be seen whether the government of Nepal accepts their request or takes their help or works in its own way
 lekin inamen se bhi zyaadaatar raahat saamagree airport par hi jamaa kara lee jaati he

 It is to be seen whether the government of Nepal accepts their request or takes their help or works in its own way
 sarkari tantra itnaa bada or chust nahin ki bukamp se tabah har sudoorvarti ilaake tak pahunch sake
 Therefore, relief material has started coming up in the airport and government warehouses, while the earthquake victims of remote areas are looking for relief

 We are reaching there on foot

 Shatrughan Sinha is the Congress candidate from Patna Sahib
 isse pehle do baar is seat se shatrughna sinha jeet darj kar chuke hai, lekin is baar unka muqabla thodaa alag he kyonki is baar vah congress ke tikat par chunaav lard rahe hai
 Shatrughan Sinha has been targeting Prime Minister Modi and BJP for the past several days
 shatrughna sinha kaa janm 9 disambar 1945 ko patna main hua tha
 He gained recognition as an actor
 unhone patna science college se apni shuruaati padhai kii

 This year he was elected to the Rajya Sabha
 iske baad 2002 main bhi vah rajyasabha ke liye chune gaye

 This time Shatrughan Sinha's party is new and the challenge is big because Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad is contesting on Patna Sahib seat from BJP

 But the matter reached the Supreme Court and the court asked the Maharashtra government to immediately stop the felling of trees, and also sought a record of how many trees have been cut so far

 Our anchors and channels have not forgotten to discuss it completely
 pakistan ko lekar bhartiya media ne kawarej kaa jo paimaana kaayam kiya he wo paimaana lagata he china ke sandarbh main out of silebus ho gaya he
 Recently, a book by Praveen Sauhni and Ghazala Wahab was reading Dragon on our doorstep
 is kitaab se ek chini khel kaa prasang mila
 It is called Go
 patrkaar praveen ko chini sena piele ke adhikari ne is khel ke bare main bataaya tha ki ham shatranj nahin pasand karte hai, go hi pasand karte hai
 In today's world it has become difficult to hide our potential
 yah khel hamen sikhaata he ki chaal chalate vakt kisi bhi tarah iraade kaa pataa na chale
 Everyone knows but intention is not known in any way
 yah khel china main do dhai hazaar saal se khelaa ja rahaa he
 In this game, the first person who fills the board with white or black band is considered victorious
 praveen sohani ne likhaa he ki is baatcheet ke agle din jab ve bazaar main gum rahe the to har jagah go jise chini bhashaa main vei kii kehete hai, bikate dekha
 Not chess
 unhen ek or sena adhikari ne bataaya tha ki china tabhi ladata he jab uskaa hit prabhavit hota he
 Nothing new has happened in the Doklam area since what happened on 18 June
 lekin alag-alag str par rose bayaan zarur aa rahe hai
 Sometimes from Beijing or sometimes from the Chinese Embassy in Delhi
 6 july ko dilli sthit chini duutavas ke raajnneetik counslar lee yaa ne ek video bayaan jari kiya he
 The statement is in English
 iskaa anuwaad main pard rahaa hum
 In this video statement, Lee is saying that during earlier disputes, Indian officials have been urging China to withdraw its army, citing public sentiment within India
 isliye chini kootneeti ke liye yah kaaphi mahatvapurn ho jaataa he ki ham sidhe bhartiya janata se hi baat karen
 Chinese Embassy officials in India do not come in very much media
 18 june ko bharat china seemaa se lage sikkim sector ke paas donon mulkon kii tukadiyon main hathapayee jaisi hui
 In 1890, Britain and China reached an agreement on Tibet and Sikkim, under which Britain gave up its claim to the sector for China
 bharat daawa kar rahaa he ki doklam bhutan kaa he
 India is concerned about its security
 jahaan tak meri jaankaree he, bharat kaa yah daawa galat he
 We have evidence that Doklam is from China
 doklam, chini seemaa ke paas rahane waalon ke liye paaramparik rup se charaagaah kaa kshetra rahaa he
 There is also a receipt of grass tax i
e
 grass tax given to Bhutanese shepherds in the Archive of Xi Zhang Autonomous Region
 yah kisi bhi samprabhu raashtra ko manzur nahin hoga
 The solution is that India should remove its troops
 bina kisi shart ke or wo bhi jaldi
 Without this, there can be no negotiated dialogue between India and China
 isse pehle buudhvaar ko beijing se bhi videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa ne isi tarah kaa bayaan diya, usase pehle dilli sthit china ke rajdoot ne bhi yahi baat doharaate hue kaha ki bharat ne antarrashtriya sandhi kaa ulanghan kiya he
 China is constantly making its statement and propaganda
 abhi tak bharat kii taraf ek hi aupchaarik bayaan aayaa he
 India believes that it has said what it had to say
 raksha mantri or senadhyaksh kaa bhi ek hi baar bayaan aayaa
 Meanwhile, on Thursday morning, PTI was quoted as saying that there would be no bilateral talks between the Prime Minister of India and the President of China arriving in Germany for the G20
 china ne baatcheet se manaa kar diya he kyonki baatcheet kaa maahaul nahin he
 PTI had issued this news citing officials of the Chinese Foreign Ministry
 is khabar ke baad bharat ke videsh mantralay ne turant pratikriya di or kaha ki bharat kii dwipaksheeya baithak argentina, canada, italy, japan, mexico, dakshin korea, britain or vietnam ke saath tay he
 With this, Prime Minister Modi will participate in the meeting of BRICS leaders, in which there is no change
 ek tarah se videsh mantralay ne ishaare se bataa diya ki pradhanmantri modi or china ke raashtrapati ke bich baatcheet tay hi nahin thi to radd kahaan se hogi
 a separate meeting of BRICS countries is scheduled in which the heads of nations of India, Brazil, Russia, South Africa and China will also be in one room
 aamane saamne to honge
 a new controversy erupted over what the Chinese Foreign Ministry officials told Indian reporters in Beijing did not get into the transcription of the official statement because it was not officially stated
 ek jaankaree yah bhi kahati he
 PTI later issued a revised copy stating that it was said by quoting unknown sources
 tanaav doklam main hua he or tivi par jhule vaali tasviir jhul rahi he
 Prime Minister Modi did nothing to welcome the Chinese President Xi Chin Fing who came to India in 2014
 tab bharat ke pradhanmantri modi ne is yatra ko ek naam bhi diya
 Inch Tuards Miles
 eench inch matlab india or china
 Like in Israel he said i for i means India for Israel
 ham eench kaa kuch or matlab samaj rahe the or china kuch or samaj gaya
 That year, a Chinese contingent moved two km inside Chumar near Ladakh
 sadak banane
 India objected strongly and deployed its troops
 demchowk main chini naagarik apana jhanda lekar khadaa ho gaya to saamne se bhartiya naagarik bhi tirangaa lekar khadaa ho gaya
 Even amid these controversies, the Prime Minister and the President kept swinging on the banks of the Sabarmati
 china ko hi apni sthiti se waapas janaa padaa
 When Prime Minister Modi also visited China in 2015, he was also given a grand welcome
 iske baad 2016 main raashatrapati shi chin fing goa bhi aae the bricks kii baithak main hissaa lene
 The comments 2014 main raashtrapati shi chin fing ne hindu akhbaar main pradhanmantri modi kii ek baat kaa samarthan kiya tha ki modi kaa kahana sahi he ki bharat or china do jism ek jaan hai
 Why are two bodies visible at this time? sab to thik hi chal rahaa tha par ab ye kyon ho rahaa he
 The editor of the newspaper Global Times is teasing
 yah akhbaar sarkari tip kaa he isliye akhbaar kaa kam sarkaar kaa mat zyaada lagata he
 It has written that because India has control over Bhutan, Bhutan has not established diplomatic relations with China
 bharat ne apane suraksha hiton ke kaaran asasmaan sandhiyon ke zariye bhutan kii kootnithik samprabhutaa ko nuksaan pahunchaaya he
 India has also imposed its policies on Sikkam
 bharat is baar bhutan kii madad kaa sahaara lekar seemaa par apane kshetreey prabhutv kaa pradarshan kar rahaa he
 India should teach a lesson for this
 duniya ko gaur karnaa chahie ki bharat kisi tarah himalayan deshon ko dabaa rahaa he
 The international community should understand Bhutan's troubles and stop India from suppressing small states
 china chahta kya he, uskaa iraadaa us go khel kii tarah he jiskaa siddhant hi is par tikaa he ki kuch ho jaae, iraade kaa pataa nahin chalanaa chahie
 Does China want propaganda from the dispute against India
 wo pakistan ke liye yah sab kar rahaa he yaa apane liye
 Bhutan is with India but why China is crying for Bhutan
 ise go kehete hai
 Journalist Praveen was told by the officer of the Chinese Army PLA about the game that we do not like chess, we like Go
 aaj kii duniya main apni kshamta ko chhipaana mushkil ho gaya he
 This game teaches us that intention is not known in any way while walking
 sab pataa chal jaae magar kisi tarah manshaa kaa pataa na chale
 This game has been played in China for two and a half thousand years
 is khel main jo sabase pehle safed yaa kaali goti se board ko bhar detaa he vahi vijayi mana jaataa he
 Praveen Sauhni has written that on the next day of this conversation while he was roaming in the market, everywhere he saw Go, which is called Wei Ki in Chinese language
 shatranj nahin
 He was told by another army officer that China fights only when its interests are affected
 doklam kshetra main 18 june ko jo hua he uske baad se kuch nayaa nahin hua he
 But daily statements are coming at different levels
 kabhi beijing se to kabhi dilli ke chini duutavas se
 On July 6, Chinese Counselor of Chinese Embassy in Delhi, Li Ya has released a video statement
 bayaan agrezi main he
 i am reading this translation
 is video bayaan main lee yaa kah rahe hai ki pehle ke vivaadon ke samay bhartiya adhikari bharat ke bheetar jan bhaavana kaa hawala dete hue china se aagrah karte rahe hai ki vah apni sena ko peeche hataa le
 Therefore, it becomes very important for Chinese diplomacy to speak directly to the Indian public
 bharat main chini duutavas ke adhikari bahut zyaada media main nahin aate hai
 On June 18, there was a scuffle between the two countries on the indo-china border along the Sikkim sector
 1890 main britain or china ke bich tibet or sikkim ko lekar ek samjhauta hua tha, jiske tahat britain ne china ke liye is sector par apni daavedaari chhod di thi
 India is claiming that Doklam is from Bhutan
 bharat apni suraksha ko lekar chintit he
 As far as i know, this claim of India is wrong
 hamaare paas pramaan hai ki doklam china kaa he
 Doklam has traditionally been a pasture area for those living near the Chinese border
 shi jang swytt kshetra ke archive main bhutani charavaahon ke die grass tex yani ghaas kar kii raseed bhi he
 This will not be accepted by any sovereign nation
 samaadhaan yahi he ki bharat apni tukdi hataa le
 Unconditionally and that too quickly
 iske bagair bharat or china ke bich koi bhi manikez baatcheet nahin ho sakati he
 Earlier on Wednesday, a Foreign Ministry spokesman from Beijing made a similar statement, before that the Chinese Ambassador to Delhi also reiterated the same thing, saying that India has violated the international treaty
 china lagaataar apana bayaan de rahaa he or propeganda kar rahaa he
 So far only one formal statement has come from India
 bharat kaa maananaa he ki jo kahana tha kah diya
 The defense minister and the army chief also came up with a statement
 is bich guuruuvaar subah pitiai ke hawaale se khabar ai ki ji-20 ke liye germany pahunch rahe bharat ke pradhanmantri or china ke raashtrapati ke bich dwipaksheeya vaarta nahin hogi
 China has refused to negotiate because there is no atmosphere of dialogue
 pitiai ne yah khabar chini videsh mantralay ke adhikariyon ke hawaale se yah jari kii thi
 Following this news, India's Foreign Ministry immediately responded and said that India's bilateral meeting is scheduled with Argentina, Canada, Italy, Japan, Mexico, South Korea, Britain and Vietnam
 iske saath hi pradhanmantri modi bricks netaaon kii baithak main hissaa lenge, jisamen koi badlaav nahin hua he
 In a way, the Ministry of External Affairs has indicated that if the talks between Prime Minister Modi and the President of China were not fixed, then from where will be canceled
 bricks deshon kii alag se baithak tay he usamen bharat, brazil, rus, dakshin africa or china ke raashtra pramukh bhi ek kamare main honge
 Will be face to face is par ek nayaa vivaad chhid gaya ki beijing main chini videsh mantralay ke adhikariyon ne bhartiya reportron se jo kaha use aadhikarik bayaan ke transcripshan main isliye nahin aayaa kyonki wo aadhikarik rup se nahin kaha gaya tha
 One information also says this
 pitiai ne baad main ek sanshodhit copy jari ki jisamen kaha ki agyaat sutron ke hawaale se aisa kaha gaya tha
 The tension is in Doklam and the swinging picture is swinging on TV
 2014 main bharat aae china ke raashtrapati shi chin fing ke swaagat main pradhanmantri modi ne koi kami nahin kii thi
 Then Prime Minister of India, Modi also gave this trip a name
 eench tuards miles
 Inch inch means India and China
 jaise israel main unhone kaha ki ai for ai matlab india for israel
 We understood the meaning of the inch more and China understood something else
 us saal ladakh ke paas chumaar main chini tukdi do kimi andar aa gai
 Road making
 bharat ne sakht etraz kiya or apni tukdi tainaat kar di
 When a Chinese citizen stood up with his flag in Demchauk, an Indian citizen also stood with a tricolor in front
 in vivaadon ke bich bhi sabarmati ke tat par pradhanmantri or raashtrapati jhula jhulate rahe
 China had to return from its position
 2015 main pradhanmantri modi ne bhi china kii yatra kii to unka bhi bhavy swaagat kiya gaya
 After this, President Xi Chin Fing came to Goa in 2016 to participate in the BRICS meeting
 tippaniyan In 2014, President Xi Chin Fing supported Prime Minister Modi's statement in a Hindu newspaper that Modi is right to say that India and China are two lives
 is vakt do jism do jaan kyon nazar aa rahe hai
 Everything was going well, but why is this happening now? vahaan ke akhbaar global times kaa sampadakeey chidhaane vaala hi he
 This newspaper is of the government type, so the government's opinion of the newspaper is less
 isane likhaa he ki bharat kaa bhutan par niyantran he isliye bhutan ne china se rajanyik sambandh kaayam nahin kiya he
 India has damaged Bhutan's diplomatic sovereignty through disparate treaties because of its security interests
 bharat ne sikkam par bhi apni nitiyon ko thopa he
 India is demonstrating its territorial dominance over the border by resorting to Bhutan's help this time
 bharat ko iske liye sabak sikhaanaa chahie
 The world should think that India is somehow suppressing the Himalayan countries
 antarrashtriya samudaay ko bhutan kii pareshaani samajni chahie or chote rajyon ke daman se bharat ko rokna chahie
 What China wants, its intention is like a Go game whose principle rests on it that something should happen, the intention should not be known
 kya china bharat ke khilaaf vivaad se propeganda karnaa chahta he
 He is doing all this for Pakistan or for himself
 bhutan to bharat ke saath he magar china bhutan ke liye kyon ro rahaa he
 Nothing new has happened in the Doklam area since what happened on 18 June

 maharashtra kii bandra east or tasgaanv-kavthe mahankaal seat par shanivaar ko vidhansabha upachunaav ke liye matdaan hua
 Former state Chief Minister and Congress leader Narayan Rane is in the fray from Bandra East, where he faces Trupti, wife of late Shiv Sena MLA Bala Sawant and mim's Rahbar Siraj Khan
 tasgaanv-kavthe mahankaal seat par rajya ke purv grahamantri aaraar patil kii patni suman patil or bijepi ke baagi ummidavaar swapanil patil ke bich muqabla he
 Bandra East is the Shiv Sena stronghold and the Thackeray family lives here in Matoshree
 is seat se shivasena ke bala saavant lagaataar do baar se vidhayak the
 After his death, the party fielded his wife Trupti Sawant in the by-election
 2014 vidhansabha chunaavon main is seat se bijepi duusare number par rahi thi, lekin is baar usne apana koi ummidavaar maidan main nahin utaara
 Narayan Rane, rebel years before Shiv Sena, came to challenge the Thackeray family in his stronghold
 halaat aise bane ki itihaas main kabhi kisi upachunaav main prachaar nahin karne vaale sharad pavaar ne bhi morcha sambhala, kyonki rane jite to vipaksh ko vidhansabha main nai urja milegi or haare to raajnneetik vanvaas lanbaa ho jayega
 The seat also includes mim's Siraj Khan, who finished third in 2014
 khan ke prachaar main ovaisi bhaaiyon ne bhi puri taaqat jhonk di thi
 Around 2 in Bandra East
 5 lakh matadaata hai, jisamen 80,000 matadaata muslim hai or 50,000 dalit
 In such a situation, the performance of MIM can determine the fate of Rane

 The NCP had requested all political parties not to field anyone against Suman, this would be a true tribute to Aaba, the rest of the parties did not give tickets to any candidate by obeying him
 lekin swapanil patil ne party ke khilaaf morcha kholkar parchaa bharaa
 After the vote, Suman Patil said, "I am confident that people will give me full support and i will win by a huge margin, these elections are not just a wave of sympathy, but the love and trust of the people for the work of RR Patil, This is his wave
 "vahiin swapanil patil ne kaha ki aaraar patil achche insaan the, lekin unhone kai kaam adhure chhod die
 There is no water in the farmers' fields here

 desh or duniya ke itihaas main 26 june ke din ye mahatvapurn ghatnaayen shaamil hai:1906 main pehali graan pre kaa aayojan hua tha
 This competition lasted 12 hours
 1919 main neuyork daily news kaa prakaashan shuru hua
 On June 26, 1963, American President John F
 Kennedy addressed a large crowd in the Berlin city of West Germany
 unhone berlin ko sheet yuddh ke dauraan vishwa main swatantraaa kaa pratik bataaya tha
 In 2004, famous film producer Yash Johar died on this day
 sahitya ke nobel puraskaar kii ghoshnaa hote hi deshbhar main khushi kii lahar daud gai
 First, people were relieved that Chetan Bhagat did not get this award even after a great composition like 'half Girlfriend'
 usase bhi zyada khush narendra modi ke samarthak the jinhone khushi ke maare vijeta kaa naam thik se nahin suna
 However, upon hearing Patrick 'modiyano's full name and nationality, his happiness was extinguished
 saath hi shanti ke nobel puraskaron kii ghoshnaa bhi hui, jo bharat ke kailash satyaarthee or pakistan kii malala usufji ko sanyukt rup se mila
 In such a turbulent environment, when the forces of India and Pakistan are fighting each other on the border, then the two people of India and Pakistan jointly hear the Nobel Prize for 'peace' listening to my laughter
 Missed
 koi kuch bhi kahe, videshiyon kaa cens of humar hota bada tagada he
 Some people sitting in Pakistan are feeling sorry even after Malala got Nobel
 wo is baat par kudhe ja rahe hai ki kashmir to haath nahin laga, le-dekar jo nobel haath aayaa use bhi aadha hindustan ne hadap liya
 Politics got heated when Bilawal Bhutto, who was slaughtered, again announced that he would take back an inch of Nobel from India
 udhar hafiz said ne bhi nobel vaapis laane ke liye qamar kas lee or apane ‘utsaahi shantidooton ’ ko poun-poun kilo kaashew-chuaare-baadaam kii thili or dilli kaa nakshaa dekar motorbot main baithaate najar aae
 As soon as Kailash Satyarthi got Nobel, people in India also swung into action
 unamem se zyaadaatar google par ‘hu ij kailash satyaarthee’ likhte paae gaye
 Although Kailash Satyarthi has been fighting for child rights for a long time but regrettably he did not get that much fame in India
 isaki mul vajah hamaare samaaj main babbti hui samvedanheenata bhi he
 See the extent of insensitivity, while Kailash Satyarthi was getting the Nobel Prize for raising voice against child labor, on the other hand Sonia Gandhi herself was sending her child to dangerous work like campaigning in Maharashtra and Haryana
 wo bhi tab, jab pichley chunaavon main rahul gandhi kii chunavi reliyon ke chalate haare hue unke pratyaashiyon ne haath jodakar vinati kii thi ki ham bina fund lard lenge lekin aap rahul ji ko chunaav prachaar par dobaaraa mat bhejiega
 This time, after the announcement of the Nobel Prize, a number of concerns are also emerging in front of the jury, which may be a matter of great pride for us that an Indian got the Nobel Prize but the jury is now facing this fear
 It is that Mayawati, like Bharat Ratna yesterday, self
 kanshiram ke liye bhi nobel puraskaar na maang baithen
 Many people resented Manmohan Singh for not getting the Nobel for Peace even after remaining sober for ten years, which the jury postponed saying that he had already received the 'no-bol' ten years ago
 had to tab ho gai jab rahul gandhi ne ‘shanti’ ke liye mandira bedi ko nobel na milane par sawaal khadey kar die
 The Nobel Committee has found that every year before the announcement of Bharat Ratna, there is a competition to ask for Bharat Ratna in India
