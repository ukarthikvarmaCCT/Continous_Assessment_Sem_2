 He said that this section takes more time than most all sections but students can save time in it by solving questions in practice and shortcut manner and for this it is necessary to remember the formulas
 ganit kii pariksha ke liye kam se kam 25 tak pahaade, 50 tak ke vargamul, 15 tak ke ghan, 15 tak ke ghan mul or buniyadi alzebra ke formule yaad kar len

 You will also be able to know the difficulty level of each subject
 france kii rajdhani paris iesas or bagdadi ke aatank se aaj bhi karaah rahi he
 But the pain of Paris raised the question of how IS became a headache for the whole world
 or uske baad sabase bada sawaal rus ke raashtrapati bladimir putin ne uthaaya ki aakhir aies ko duniya ke 40 desh kyon madad kar rahe hai
 So who are the 40 Clementes who made Baghdadi such a great devil? ji-20 sammelan kaa vishay badlavaise to duniyabar ke bade netaa apane deshon ko vikaas kii patari par sarapat daudane ke liye turki ke antalya main ji-20 sammelan main pahunche the
 But the terror attack on Paris changed the course of the debate
 ab sawaal ye tha ki aies ke aatanki panje se duniya ko bachaaya kaise jaae
 But an even bigger question arose as to who is helping IS and Baghdadi
 putin ne kiya saaf isharasammelan ke dauraan roosi raashtrapati bladimir putin ne ishaara karte hue kaha ki duniya ke 40 aise desh hai jo bagdadi kii madad kar rahe hai
 Giving money to IS
 putin ne ishaara to kar diya lekin ab sawaal uthta he ki aakhir wo koun se desh hai jo aies or bagdadi ke aakaa ban gaye hai
 Why are those countries helping this terrorist organization? putin ne un ji-20 deshon par bhi ungali uthaai, jinaki baithkon main aatank par hangaamaa machaa tha
 ALSO READ: The result of isis's wrath was the Paris attack, even in IS-20, according to Russian President Vladimir Putin, who shared his intelligence on ISIS with G-20 countries
 unhone udhaaharan ke saath bataaya ki kaise IS tak kareeb 40 mulkon se paisa pahunch rahaa he
 It also includes fellow G-20 countries
 IS tel kaa gaiyrkanoonee kaarobaar karata he
 Putin stressed the need to end it with immediate effect
 kai desh hai bagdadi ke aakaaatank ke masale par bade or amir deshon ke paakhandee ravaiye ko putin ne benakaab kar diya
 But first it is necessary to know which are those countries, which also cry the cry of terror and also help the IS immensely
 is suchi main sabase upar to america kaa hi naam he
 Apart from the US, IS, which has suffered fresh attacks from France, Britain, Australia, Mexico, Canada, Israel, Argentina, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, UAE, Kuwait, Bahrain, Tunisia, Libya also help Baghdadi with money
 
 zarur padhemblack frideh aise paris par barapa aatank or maut kaa kaharaur bhi

 Actually, only countries like America, Australia, France, Britain, Mexico, Canada, Saudi Arabia, Turkey are included in these countries
 jin par roosi raashtrapati putin ne ungali uthaai he
 Despite the double reality, the US is making a hue and cry to destroy IS
 turki kii rajdhani main baithkar ji-20 deshon ke jin bees shikhar netaaon ne aies ke khilaaf jang kaa elaan kiya, un deshon main duniya kii do tihaai aabaadi rahati he or duniya kii sakal gharelu utpaada ke 85 fisadi hisse par inkaa hi kabja he
 In the same way, 75 per cent of the world's business is done by twenty countries
 to kya duniya bhar main faile bagdadi ke 'wo' chalis aakaa apni galatiyon se sabak lenge or bagdadi ke aatank kaa khaatmaa karenge
 This in itself is a big question

 He played the lead role in a TV program called Yeh Jo Hai Zindagi
 ye program kaaphi hit rahaa
 Apart from this, he was also seen playing an important role in Gulzar's serial Ghalib
 13 march, 1996 ko 50 saal kii umr main unka nidhan ho gaya
 There are protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and NRC (NRC) across the country
 kai jagahon par ye pradarshan hinsa main badal gaye
 In such a situation, many state governments have implemented section 144 in many cities
 police ne shanti vyavastha banaae rakhane ke liye dhara-144 lagaai he
 Actually, Section-144 is imposed anywhere in any city due to the possibility of law and order deterioration or due to any event
 aaie jaanate hai ki aakhir dhara-144 he kya or iskaa paalan na karne par kya sajaa ho sakati he
 What Happens Section -144 comes under the crpc to establish peace system
 is dhara ko lagu karne ke liye jila magistrate yani jiladhikari ek notification jari karata he
 And wherever this stream is applied, four or more people cannot gather there
 is dhara ko lagu kiye jane ke baad us sthaan par hathiyaaron ke laane le jane par bhi roak laga di jaati he
 What is the provision of punishment? Police can arrest a person who violates section-144 or does not follow this section
 us vyakti kii giraftaar dhara-107 yaa phir dhara-151 ke tahat kii ja sakati he
 Those who violate this section or are not complied with can also be sentenced to one year of imprisonment
 vaise yah ek jamaanti aparaadh he, isamen jamaanat ho jaati he
 What is the Code of Criminal Procedure (CRPC) The Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 is the main law for the implementation of criminal law in India
 yah san 1973 main paarit hua tha
 It was implemented in the country on 1 April 1974
 dand prakriya samhita kaa sankshipt naam 'siarpisi' he
 When a crime is committed, there are always two procedures, which the police follow in investigating the crime
 ek prakriya peedit ke sambandh main or duusari aaropee ke sambandh main hoti he
 These procedures are described in CRPC
 kharaab vyavhaar kii ijaajat nahin detaa kanoonkuch prakaar ke maanav vyavhaar aise hote hai jisaki kanoon ijaajat nahin detaa
 a person has to bear the consequences of such behavior
 kharaab vyavhaar ko aparaadh yaa gunaah kehete hai
 And its consequences are called punishments
 vivek agnihotri ke nirdesan main bani film 'da taashkand files' bharat ke purv pradhanmantri laal bahadur shastri kii rahasyamay maut ke peeche kii sachai ko ujagar karne kii koshish karti he
 But the film seems to tell a different story of its own
 laal bahadur shastri kaa nidhan 11 janvari 1966 ko taashkand main shanti samjhaute par sin karne ke kuch ghanton baad ho gaya tha
 Why were there scars on Shastri's body in the film? Why was the post-mortem not done? As the question arises
 aaie jaanate hai kisi bani he da taashkand files
 
 
 The story of the film begins with a journalist Ragini Phule (shweta Basu Prasad), who has been given a 15-day ultimatum by her boss
 raagini ko sansanikhej news kaa intjaar he
 Meanwhile, Ragini gets the Tashkent files on hand
 or raagini bharat ke duusare pradhanmantri laal bahadur shastri kii rahasyamayi maut se judi ek khabar akhbaar main chhapava detii he
 After this news, the government has to open the case of death of Lal Bahadur Shastri and then there are many ups and downs in the film
 film main kis tarah ke terns aate hai? kaise raagini sachai ko ujagar karne kii koshish karti he? laal bahadur shastri kii deth mistry sulajh paati he yaa nahin in tamaam sawaalon ke liye film dekhni hogi
 It is needless to say that Shastri's death has been seen as a conspiracy in the film, but the facts presented in the film about it seem unilaterally till the climax
 film main shweta basu prasad apane kairactor main ghusane ke chalate kai baar over acting karti najar aati hai
 She also appears hyper in some scenes in the film
 nasiruddin shah, pallavi joshi, mandira bedi or pankaj treepathi samet kai kalakaaron kaa abhinay film main damdaar najar nahin aata he
 Actors do not appear to do justice to their character
 haalanki, mithun chakravarti kii acting thik thaak kah sakate hai
 The cinematography of the film is good
 film kaa bekagranud mujeec bhi acha nahin he
 The film looks like a pause
 bich-bich main to movie bojhil ho jaati he
 Which is not impressive at all
 damdaar subject hone ke baavjood vivek agnihetri film main kamaal nahin dikhaa paae
 a good film could be made on this subject
 bharat ko kai baar apane sanyam se mushkil halaat se baahar nikaalane vaale captain mahendra singh dhoni ne kaha he ki anya logon kii tarah unhen bhi dabaav mahasoos hota he, lekin vah is sthiti se baahar nikal jate hai kyonki unhen pataa he ki sambhavit mushkil halaat se kaise nipatna he
 With the help of Dhoni's unbeaten 45, India were successful in defeating the West Indies by four wickets in the World Cup pool match at Waka yesterday
 dhoni ne media se baat karte hue kaha, ‘‘sabhi ko lagata he ki mujhe dabaav mahasoos nahin hota
 i feel pressurized like no other
 baat sirf itani si he ki main kai baar aisi sthiti kaa saamana kar chukaa hum isliye mujhe pataa he ki is sthiti se baahar kaise nikalnaa he
 But it is not that i always succeed
 lekin jab aapako isse nipatane kaa tarika pataa hota he to yah aasaan ho jaataa he
 '' aakraamak ballebaaj ke rup main shuruyaat karne vaale dhoni ke khel main pichley ek dashak main kaaphi sudhaar aayaa he or vah simit over ke cricket main sarvshereshth finishr main shaamil hai
 He said, "my batting improved a lot after the 2006 Pakistan tour
 iske baad maine lagaataar nichle kram main ballebaaji kii
 My place is after 30 overs
 mujhe samay kii maang ke anusaar khelnaa hota he
 Sometimes it happens that we bat first and i have to play big shots
 jabaki lakshya kaa peechha karte hue meri bhoomika teji se ran banane yaa phir pari ko sthirataa dene kii hoti he
 '' lambey samay ke baad dhoni ne apni ballebaaji par baat kii or kal sheersh kram ke puri tarah se vifal rahane ke baad team ko jis mushkil sthiti kaa saamana karnaa padaa us par bhi charchaa kii
 Dhoni said, "it is good for us that the lower middle order got a chance to bat because you want to keep scoring
 kaisaa bhi mauka mili aap hameshaa sochate ho ki kuch or ran bane to behatar rahegaa
 It was a good opportunity because there was some pressure
 ’’ The Indian captain said, "the place where i bat is usually the pressure
" pehle ballebaaji karte hue yaa to antim paanch se saat over bache hote hai yaa westeindies match jaisi sthiti hoti he, lakshya kaa peechha karne kaa dabaav
 This is the real situation, in any case i have to partner with the lower order
 ’’ Dhoni said, "I (ravichandran) partnered with Ashwin
 nateeja acha rahaa
 The good thing is that the sixth and seventh place usually have two special roles
 sheersh kram ne acchhee shuruyaat di he to maidan par utarkar teji se ran batoro yaa phir sheersh kram ke out hone ke baad pari ko sanbhaalo
 '' bharat kii senior mahila cricketer mitali raaj or ramesh powar ke bich vivaad prashaskon ke dakhal ke bina shuukravaar ko coach kaa teen maheene kaa kaarykaal samaapt hone ke saath khatm ho jayega
 After the completion of Powar's term, the BCCI will call for fresh applications for the post
 aisi sambhaavna he ki aavedan karne par bhi ab powar ke naam par vichaar nahin kiya jayega
 a top BCCI official said, "their contract is ending today and there is little chance of their return
" ’westeindies main isisi tii-20 vishwa cap ke dauraan england ke khilaaf semifinal main mitali ko baahar rakhane ke kaaran vivaad paidaa hua tha
 India beat England by eight wickets in that match
 bharat is baar nahin jeeta to australia main kabhi nahin jeet sakegaa: dean jonshmitali ne aarope lagaaya ki powar unhen barbaad karnaa chaahate hai jabaki coach ne unke ravaie par sawaal uthaae the
 Powar was appointed in August when Tushar Arothe stepped down due to differences with senior players
 powar ke jane ke baad dekhnaa yah he ki tii-20 captain harmanpreet cor or vanade captain mitali apane aapasi matbhed kaise dur karti hai
 India now have to tour New Zealand in January and the team will hope to stay away from controversies with the new coach
 board ke ek anya adhikari ne kaha, ‘yah dekhnaa hoga ki westeindies main jo kuch hua, uske baad harmanpreet or mitali kaise saamanjasy bithaati hai
 This has to be done for the betterment of the team or else there will be more issues in the dressing room
 ’kohli ko lekar ponting kaa mindgem, is kangaroo khilaadi ko bataaya behatarharmanpreet ne abhi tak is masale par koi bayaan nahin diya he, lekin semifinal main mitali ko baahar rakhane ke faisle kaa samarthan kiya tha
 Mithali has already said that she wants to resolve differences with Harmanpreet
 unhone kaha, ‘ham donon senior khilaadi hai or agar masale honge bhi to mil baithkar sulajhaa lenge
 She is one of our best players and i would always like both of us to give our best for India

 actress ne kaha, kya aap jaanate hai, jis jagah se aaj main shooting kar waapas lauti hum, vahaan jiro network tha
 It was a world where there is no network, no message or phone
 aapako pataa hi nahin hota ki duniya main chal kya rahaa he
 i was in a similar place for some time
 yah mumbai ke paas hi he
 i was very happy
 maine sochaa, yah bhi ek jindagi kaa experions he
 When Anushka Sharma met Deepika's boyfriend, Anushka looked like this, so i do not know what has been released today
 main kuch bhi nahin dekha he
 Next time i meet you guys, i will definitely answer your question
 khayr, anoushka ne to apana jawaab de diya
 But the funny thing is that the day this statement was made, he posted a picture on social media
 isliye anoushka kaa jiro network kii baat kahana samaj se pare he
 Why did Anushka, who called Deepika her friend, gave such an answer
 kahi donon ke bich kisi tarah kaa manmutav to nahin he
 a few days ago during the GQ Awards, Anushka and Ranveer Singh saw a good bond

 Deepika's Unibro also remains a topic of discussion in social media
 kya he rani padmavati kii kahanefilm kii kahani rani padmavati kii jindagi par aadhaarit he
 Ranveer Singh Alauddin Khilji is in the role
 aisa pehali baar he, jab ranvir negative role main najar aaenge
 The passage of Alauddin Khilji and Padmavati was written by Sufi poet Mallik Muhammad Jaisi in 1540 under Sher Shah Suri

 However, he did not manage to do so during the Queen's life

 It is to be noted that since the coastal plant was hit by a tsunami on March 11, the refrigerant systems of the reactors have stalled, due to which the temperature and pressure in the reactors increased
 is kaaran sanyantr main riektaron ke pighalane kaa khatra paidaa ho gaya
 Earlier, according to Kyodo News Agency, Tapco has stated that power has been reached through a diesel generator at reactor number-5 and reactor number-6, and cables are being laid from reactor number-2 to a temporary sub-station, where Friday Electricity had reached only

 The government has decided to hand over the investigation to the murder to the CBI
 is baat elaan khud haryana ke mukhyamantri manohar laal khatter ne pradhyumna ke mata-pita se mulaakaat karne ke baad kiya
 Not only this, Ryan International School in Gurgaon will also be under the government for three months
 pradhyumna hatyakantaki jaanch ko lekar pehle din se hi uske mata-pita sibiai jaanch kii maang kar rahe the
 During this period, there were frequent new revelations in this matter
 do din pehle hi is cese kii jaanch ke liye gathit kii gai esaiti ne skool saare staff se poochtacha kii thi
 After this, inquiries continued again yesterday
 is dauraan shuukravaar ko pradhyumna ke mata-pita ne mukhyamantri khatter se mulaakaat kar phir se sibiai jaanch kii maang ko doharaaya
 Just after that, the Chief Minister announced a CBI inquiry into the matter
 unhone bataaya ki agle teen maah ke liye gudgaanv kaa reyaan international skool sarkaar ke adheen rahegaa
 Let us tell you that on Friday, the lawyer of Pradyuman murder accused Conductor Ashok claimed that Ashok is being implicated in this murder case
 isse pehle bhi ashok kii bhoomika ko lekar sawaal uthte rahe hai
 However, it can also be said that Ashok's lawyer is doing what the defense counsel should do
 pradhyumna kii hatya ke baad bas conductor ashok ne police ke saamne apana gunaah kabool kiya tha
 Even on the camera of Aaj Tak, he confessed to the murder
 lekin is maamle main ab nayaa mode aa gaya he
 Actually, Ashok's lawyer Mohit Verma has claimed that Ashok is innocent
 bas conductor ashok ke vakil mohit verma kaa kahana he ki ashok ko is maamle main fansaaya gaya he
 The police and the school management pressurized Ashoka and badly tortured him by the police to confess the charge

 Playing for the country is not 'a favor to anyone' and that is perhaps why the Indian captain Virat Kohli does not consider Kohlikhud as 'deserving of something special' despite spending ten years in international cricket

 They believe that nothing should be accepted as fixed

 He told TV, 'it is a great honor for me to represent the country and even after playing for ten years, i do not feel that i am entitled to anything special
 aapako tab bhi antarrashtriya str par prayek ran ke liye kadi mehnat kerani hogi
 He said, 'there are many people who want to play for India
 jab aap khud ko us sthiti main rakhte ho to aapke andar bhi ranon kii vahi bhukh honi chahie or chizon ko tayshuda nahin maananaa chahie
 Do not consider it easy on any level

 cyna nahin to padak kii koi ummid nahin
 Indian badminton empress Saina Nehwal was repulsed when she recovered from injury and went to the Glasgow Commonwealth Games to prepare for the World Cup starting on 25 August and the Asian Games starting in September
 kuch saal pehle cricket ko chhodkar duusare khelon main kisi sthapit khilaadi kaa vikalp khojane kii baat bemaani maaloom hoti thi
 Now the times have changed, especially in the sport of Indian badminton
 glassgo main cyna nehwal ke saathiyon ne yah dikhaa diya ki ve unki gaiyr-maujuudagi main viraasat barkaraar rakhane kaa madda rakhte hai
 P
 ve
 Sindhu is just 19 years old, but her confidence continues to grow and there is consistency in her performance as well
 sindhu ne glassgo main apana pehla kaansya padak jeet liya
 The women's doubles pair of Jwala Gatta and Ashwini Ponnappa won the silver medal
 24 varshiya aaremavi gurusidatt ne semi-final main jabardast muqabla kiya or purushon ke ekal mukaable main kaansya padak hasil kiya
 And the miracle happened when Parupalli Kashyap surprised everyone by winning the gold medal in the men's singles match
 isse pehle saiyad modi ne bristben main 1982 ke khelon main swarna padak hasil kiya tha
 In a thump against Singapore's Derek Wong, Kashyap leapt into the air several times and defeated his opponent by striking a strong shot and took off his shirt like a football player
 unhone apni mutithyaan hawa main laharaayin, jaise ki cricket main shatak lagane ke baad ballebaaj akasar kiya karte hai
 Bouncing happily, Kashyap took the tricolor from the hands of an Indian fan and circled the field like a champion runner
 kade mukaable vaale match main jeet ke baad kashyap ne kaha, “yah pehla mauka tha, jab kisi bade mukaable main maine swarna padak hasil kiya he
 That is why i was so happy
 
 
 main valrd championships, olympic or ol england open main quarter final tak pahunch chukaa hum
 i know that winning gold in CWG is different
 ”haalanki 2010 main dilli khelon main unhone kaansya padak jeeta tha, lekin kashyap ke liye swarna padak sapana hi bana hua tha
 This gold medal was also contributed by Gurusaidutt, who defeated Malaysia's highest seeded player Chong Wei Feng in the quarter-finals
 chot ke kaaran nehwal kii tarah purv champion or vishwa ke number ek khilaadi lee chong ve ke mukaable se baahar rahane se kashyap ke liye yah sunaharaa mauka tha
 The 27-year-old Kashyap has been overcoming obstacles since the beginning of his career
 badminton se gahare lagaav ke chalate ejineering college kii seat thukaraane ke baad kashyap ke liye khel kaa kariyar us samay khatm hota dikhaa jab 19 saal kii umr main pataa chalaa ki unhen dama kii beemaari he
 But he did not give up and decided to enroll in the Badminton Academy of All England champions Pullela Gopichand in Hyderabad
 nehwal or sindhu bhi yaheen se prashikshan leti hai
 Kashyap kept busy despite his lungs suffering in the ordinary hall with old air conditioners
 antat gopichand ke sahare kashyap ne sikh liya ki is beemaari ke saath kaise khel jari rakhaa jaae
 The SWOT analysis of strong opponents in Glasgow, which Gopichand had already done, helped Kashyap strategize
 gopichand ne kashyap ko rang or gurusaindutt ke mukaable ko dhyaan se dekhne ke liye kaha or unhen kuch behad upyogi salaah di
 During the final match, he sat on the sidelines and whispered continuously to Kashyap that he should keep calm and play a natural game
 kashyap kehete hai, “unhone mujhase kaha ki main match ke nattejey par dhyaan na dekar bas agle ank par dhyaan duun
 i trusted myself and took my natural shots
 agar aaj main duniya ke 20 bade khiladinnon main hum to iskaa shrey gopi sar ko jaataa he
 They understand me more than anyone else
 ”gopichand kii raay main buniyadi siddhant saral or spasht hai
 He says, "to play well, full dedication is the first requirement
 main sabhi khiladinnon se kahata hum ki ve subah se raat tak ek nishchit dincharya kaa paalan karen or har seshan main hameshaa maujuud rahen
 This brings firmness
 tabhi koi khilaadi tej va furtila banataa he
 It is very important to prepare with strategy for every match
 ”unki academy ke duusare khilaadi bhi unke is darshan kaa paalan karte hai
 One of them, Sindhu, made a slight mistake in the semi-finals and had to pay for it
 unhen kaansya padak par santosh karnaa padaa
 Sindhu says, "achieving the highest win depends on how you play on that day, apart from your game
 mujhe apane drop shot or hit par dhyaan dena he
 “world number 10 Sindhu is a rising star in the world of badminton
 unhen do grand pri swarna or 2013 kii beadbluef valrd championships main ek kaansya padak mil chukaa he

 No other pair is available after the jwala-ashwini pairing
 ” lekin gopichand ko puri ummid he ki jo maujuud pratibhaaen aage chalakar acchhee jodissan taiyaar hongi

 sibiai ke special jaj biech loya kii maut ke maamle main supreme court ne swatantra jaanch karaane kii yachika khaarij kar di or kaha ki maamle kaa koi aadhaar nahin he, isliye isamen jaanch nahin hogi
 The court clearly stated that there is no reason to doubt the statement given by the judges on the death of Judge Loya
 unke bayaan par andeh karnaa santhaan par andeh karnaa jaisaa hoga
 The lawyers, seeking an independent investigation into Loya's death, made several arguments in support of their demand, but the Supreme Court did not consider them weighty and dismissed them outright
 maaloom ho kisoharabuddin shaikh encountermaamle kii sibiai kii vishesh adaalat main sunwaayee kar rahe jaj loya kii maut 1 disambar 2014 ko nagpur main hui thi, jisaki vajah dil kaa daura padana bataaya gaya tha
 He was in Nagpur for the wedding of his associate judge Swapna Joshi's daughter
 unki maut par andeh karte hue latur baar association ke purv adhyaksh udai gavaare ne jaj loya kii maut ko sandigdh bataaya or kaha ki unhen yakeen he ki yah purvaniyojit hatya he
 He told that on the day Loya died, many people including many judges told him that Loya had been cheated
 yah maamla itnaa samvedansheel tha ki koi bhi shikaayat darj karne kii himmat nahin karata
 At the same time, former Justice of Bombay High Court BG Kolse Patil had called the investigation into Loya's death a matter of prestige of the entire judiciary
 unhone kaha tha ki nyaaypalika kii izzat daanv par lagi he jise sabhi ko or adaalat ko milakar bachaana he
 Kolse Patil said that there is an atmosphere of fear in the country even today
 yah maamla bahut kuch khol saktaa he
 In the Supreme Court, lawyer Indira Jaising also raised doubts over the death of Judge Loya
 unhone kaha tha ki gujarat ke purv grih mantri haren pandya kii maut kaise hui kisi ko pataa nahin
 How can a state that does not save its home minister save the common people
 isliye loya kii maut kaa maamla mahatvapurn or samvedansheel tha
 As a result, the case was asked to run out of Gujarat in Mumbai
 unhone kaha, 'loya ke parivaar main kisi ko dil sambandhi beemaari kaa koi record nahin he, unke 80 saal ke pita yaa mata ko bhi bladpressure yaa sugar jaisi koi beemaari nahin he, jabaki loya 48 saal ke the or unako bhi dil se judi koi beemaari nahin thi
 Indira Jaising told about his health that he used to exercise for two hours daily
 sharaab or dhumrapaan se bhi dur rahete the
 Indira Jaising said that Justice Loya himself climbed the stairs in the hospital himself despite pain
 ye bhi saaf nahin he ki unki ECG hui thi yaa nahin, or agar hui to kis aspataal main hui or kisne kii
 He said, 'the police also acted in the investigation
 siarpisi 174 ke tahat karrwai bhi puri taur par nahin kii gai
 Also no FIR was registered
 police ko isaki cese diary banaakar sambandhit magistrate ko bhejni chahie thi, iske baad magistrate aage kii karrwai karne kaa nirdesh dete
 Senior journalist Pallav Sisodia, who appeared in the Loya case on behalf of Maharashtra journalist BS Lonkey, had asked the court to have an independent inquiry into the matter
 unhone do paraspar virdohi khabaron kaa hawala dete hue kaha ki isaki vajah se 'hamaari nyaayik pranali kii nishtha par akshep lage hai
 Referring to the four-judge press conference, he said that this also provided an opportunity for some judges of this court to object to the hearing of the case
 aisi sthiti main swatantra jaanch ekatarfa nahin ho sakati
 At the same time, senior advocate Prashant Bhushan had demanded a judicial inquiry or a special investigation team to investigate Judge BH Loya's death
 unhone daawa kiya ki loya kii maut dil kaa daura padane se nahin hui he jaisaa ki sarkari adhikari daawa kar rahe hai
 He demanded that it should be investigated
 unka kahana tha ki sibiai yah jaanch nahin kar sakati he kyonki us par dher sara sarkari dabaav hota he
 The government wants the matter to be dismissed immediately

 ) The election of Rajya Sabha Deputy Chairman before the Lok Sabha elections is considered to be the biggest test of opposition unity against Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 is pad ke liye endie se jediu ke harivansh narayan singh ummidavaar hai, vahiin, vipaksh kii ore se congress ke bike hariprasad maidan main hai
 The ruling NDA is far from the majority figure in the Rajya Sabha, while all the opposition parties are getting enough seats for the majority
 baavjood iske bike hariprasad haarate hai to modi ke khilaaf bani kathith vipakshi ekta kii pole khul jaaegi
 Let us know that the tenure of the recently retired Deputy Chairman PJ Kurien ended in last month i
e
 July
 245 sadasyeey rajyasabha main is samay 244 sadsy hai jabaki 1 seat khaali he
 In the current 244-member Upper House, 123 votes would be required to win the Deputy Speaker election
 aise main endie or upie donon paksh bahumat ke aankade se dur hai
 The ruling NDA has 100 mps in the Rajya Sabha
 inmembijapi ke 73, shivasena ke 3, bodo pipuls front ke paas 1, jediu ke 6, arpiai (e) ke 1, shiromani akali dal ke 3, sikkim democratic front ke 1, namankit sadsy 4, 3 anya or nirdaleey 6 sadsy shaamil hai
 Looking at the number of all parties of the opposition, this figure reaches 144
 inamen congress ke 50, bispi ke 4, tiemasi ke 13, sipiai ke 2, sipiem ke 5, diemke ke 4, indian muslim lig ke 1, jedies ke 1, kerala congress ke 1, ensipi ke 4, argedy ke 5, espi ke 13, tidipi ke 6, ediemke ke 13, biju janata dal ke 9, indian neshnal lokdal ke 1, pidipi ke 2, tiares ke 6, wiesar congress ke 2 or aam aadmi party ke 3 sadsy shaamil hai
 In fact, Congress has tried to field BK Hariprasad and perform a litmus test of opposition unity
 is chunaav ke baad vipaksh kii tasviir saaf ho jaaegi ki koun-koun se dal piem modi ke khilaaf congress ke saath khadey rahete hai or koun se nahin
 In this case, manipulations have started from both NDA and UPA parties
 endie apana kunbasanbhalane ke saath-saath vipaksh ke dalon se bhi samarthan jutaney main laga he
 As of now, all the NDA allies stand with full support in support of Harivansh Singh
 iske alaava endie vipaksh kii ekta main send lagane main bhi kaamyaab hota dikh rahaa he
 The opposition is stronger than the ruling party, but not all parties are seen standing in favor of the Congress candidate
 tidipi ne congress ko samarthan karne kaa elaan kar diya he
 But for kcr's party TRS and Naveen Patnaik's party BJD, it seems difficult to support the Congress candidate
 isi tarah se ediemke kaa bhi congress ke saath aana mushkil he
 The Aam Aadmi Party has three Rajya Sabha members
 party netaa or rajyasabha sadsy sanjay singh ne kaha ki upasabhapati chunaav main congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ko samarthan ke liye hamaari party ke rashtriya sanyojak arvind kejariwal se baat kerani chahie, kyonki unhen hi isapar faisla karnaa he
 However, the Congress has also started talks for support from opposition parties
 bike hariprasad khud or congress ke gulam nabi aaazaad se lekar ashok gahalot tak vipaksh dalon se samarthan jutaney main lage hai
 Despite this, parties like BJD, TRS are seen standing in favor of NDA candidate
 vipakshi dalon main is tarah send lagati rahi to congress ke bike hariprasad kaa jeet paanaa kaaphi mushkil ho jayega
 With the defeat of BK Hariprasad, the talk of opposition unity which is being continuously done, will also open its pole

 raashtrapati chunaav ke khatm hone ke baad jameen ke mudde par jharkhand kii raajnneeti ek baar phir se garmane vaali he
 In fact, on the lines of Bihar, Shibu Soren family in Jharkhand has been accused of acquiring illegal assets worth crores

 arvind kejariwal ne 2012 main sandigdh bhrashtachar ko lekar desh ke sarvaadhik taqatvar logon main kuch par aaropon ke bam phenk kar bhartiya raajnneeti main dastak se pehle apni damdaar maujuudagi kaa ahsaas karaayaa
 But this year it seems that the wheel of Kaal has started turning around
 india today ke paas aise dastavej maujuud hai jinase dilli kii aam aadmi party sarkaar main sambhavit duraachaar ke sanket milte hai
 The same government, whose command is in the hands of a person who was once considered the face of the anti-corruption movement
 jaanch ke adheen aise akatya saboot dikhte hai jo ishaara karte hai ki kis tarah mukhyamantri ke kareebi rishtedaaron ne peedbludi department kii ore se kamishan kiye gaye ek civik project ke liye farji bill jamaa kiye gaye
 The PWD department now falls under Delhi government minister Satyendar Jain
 kejariwal ke divangat sadhu surendra kumaar bansal ke pasrenu construction companika swaamitv tha
 The document shows that Renu Construction Company got the responsibility of a drainage project in 2015 at Bakli village near National Highway 44 in North West Delhi
 sarkari records ke mutabik renu construction ko sabase kam boli dene kii vajah se project kaa contract diya gaya
 In a special conversation with Kejriwal today, Delhi BJP President Manoj Tiwari said that Arvind Kejriwal has been exposed, Kejriwal's brother-in-law has been paid a fake bill
 manoj tiwari bole ki ab samaj main aata he ki satyendra jain arvind kejariwal ko 2 karod kyon de rahe the
 This issue should be investigated, because it is directly the responsibility of Kejriwal
 manoj tiwari ne aarope lagaaya ki dilli main tex dene vaale logon ke paison ko lutaa ja rahaa he
 But now there are indications that the ruling Aam Aadmi Party has done something in the past that it did not want to come out in public
 dastavej se aise chhalpurna tareekon kaa sanket miltaa he jo mukhyamantri ke rishtedaar kii ore se sarkari khajaane ko chuunaa lagane ke liye sambhavat: apanaae gaye
 Bansal, who is no longer in this world, according to the document, Mahadev was seen collecting construction materials for the drainage system from Impex
 lekin jab india today kii team sonipat main is company ke die gaye pate- bi-22 industrial aria par pahunchi to is naam kii company kaa namonnishaan tak nahin dikhaa
 The non-profit organization Road Anti Corruption Organization (RACO) obtained government documents through an RTI petition
 in dastavej ke mutabik gaiyr astitv vaali mahadev impex kii or se do karod rupye jitani moti rakam tak ke bill die gaye, jise dilli ke peedbludi department ne hari jhandi de di jabaki project kaa puraa hona baaki tha
 According to the petitioner Viplav Awasthi, the Chief Minister is suspected of violating rules to benefit his brother-in-law Bansal
 avasthi kaa kahana he, ‘hamane peedbludi ke kaamkaaj kii samuchit jaanch kii maang kii he
 The Chief Minister should not be outside its purview
 unhen bhi apane rishtedaar se jude jaalsaji ke cese kii jaanch kaa vishay mana janaa chahie
 India Today also has a copy of the FIR that was recently filed by the Anti Corruption Bureau of Delhi to investigate the alleged scam
 kejariwal ke vistrut parivaar ke ahm sadsy kii or ishaara karne vaala ye ghotaalaa aise vakt main aayaa he jab aam aadmi party khud barkhaast kiye gaye mantri kapil mishra kii or se aaropon kii bambaari kaa saamana kar rahi he
 Kapil Mishra has targeted Kejriwal, his government's minister Satyendar Jain and even Bansal for the allegations
 haalanki mukhyamantri ke parivaar ne baagi tevar apnaane vaale mishra ke sabhi aaropon ko khaarij kiya he
 It is also said that its script has been written by political opponents
 kejariwal kii patni sunita kejariwal ne mishra ke aaropon ke jawaab main twits kii jhadi laga di
 Sunita Kejriwal wrote in the tweet- 'my brother-in-law is not in this world and this stupid person is reading the script written without using his mind
 ’is bich dilli sarkaar ne peedbludi dren ghotaale main kisi tarah kii bhi sanliptata se inkaar kiya he
 Public Works Minister Satyendar Jain said, 'this contract (to Bansal) was given in January 2015 after a competitive bid before the Aam Aadmi Party government came to power
 ham satta main farvari 2015 main aae
 Jain said that the minister is not involved in the payment of every company

 Pending litigation in courts in the country is hurting economic growth
 2017-18 ke aarthik survey main kaha gaya tha ki railway, road, power project ke court main atake maamalon kii vajah se inaki laagat main 60 fisadi se zyada kii badhotaree ho gai
 Various studies show that several lakh crores of lawsuits related to taxes in the country are stuck in courts and most of them have been appealed in the government
 lekin lambit mukademon kii samasya neeche se shuru hoti he
 According to the Economic Survey of 2018-19, 87 of the total pending cases in the country
 54 fisadi cese nichali adaalaton main lambit hai
 The lower courts in Odisha, Bihar, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat have the highest number of cases pending for more than four years
 odisha, bihar or pashchim bengal main civil or aapraadhik donon tarah ke maamalon ke nibatare main lagane vaala samay rashtriya ausat se kahin adhik he
 The government states that 74 in the District and Subordinate Courts in 2018
 7 fisadi civil or 86
 5% of criminal cases were resolved within three years
 2017 main 2
 87 crore cases were pending
 janvari se disambar 2018 ke bich 1
 5 crore new cases have come
 2018 main 1
 33 cases were settled but number of pending cases3
 04 karod ho gai
 As of October 2018, there were more than 56 thousand cases pending in the Supreme Court while the number of cases pending in various High Courts was more than 44 lakhs till June 2018
 nichali adaalaton main lambit maamalon kii tulana main aapraadhik maamle dhai guna zyada hai
 America and Europe have a very good record in settling the case with India
 council of europe ke sadsy deshon se tulana kii jaae to bharat main cese nipataane main chaar se chah guna zyada vakt lagata he
 The reason behind the pending litigation lies in the infrastructure
 desh main jajon kii sankhya jarurat se kam he
 As of December 2018, the total working judges were only 17891 (79 per cent) against the sanctioned strength of 22750 judges in lower courts
 2018 ke sabhi maamle nipataane ke liye 2279 atirikt nyaayadhishon kii jarurat thi
 In the next five years, more than 8 thousand judges will be required to settle all the cases
 hoicourt kaa ek jaj 2348 mukademen saal bhar main nipataata he
 By the end of 2018, 671 (62 per cent) judges were working against the sanctioned strength of 1079 judges in the High Courts
 nae jaj agar bhartee ho bhi gaye to unki adaalat ke liye kamaron kaa nirmaan karaane ke liye bhi sarkaar ke acha khaasaa paisa kharch karnaa hoga
 Expensive justice is the main reason for the pending litigation
 log jelon main band rahete hai kyonki unke paas vakil kii seva lene ke liye paise nahin hote hai

 Those born in small districts in the nineties will remember when an announcer used to promote films while sitting on a rickshaw in his locality
 logon ko chhavigrih yani ki cinema haul tak bulaane kaa jo andaaj hota tha wo logon ko behad aakarshith karata tha
 Many young children used to run far behind the rickshaw and the informer kept giving information about the film, the actors working in it, show time etc
 dialog ke bich-bich main film kaa gaanaa chalata tha
 Children used to run around singing and singing along with the song
 upi ke khakhareru gaanv kaa najaara bhi un dinon kii yaad dilaataa he
 Especially the manner of speaking of the narrator and shayari gets pulled in the old days
 anounsar pehle upipisiel kaa sandesh bolte hue logon se bill jamaa karne kii apil karata he
 He says that if someone does not submit the bill, then his connection can be cut, legal action can be taken against him
 phir purana gaanaa chalane lagata he or phir shaayari
 
 bilkul puraane dinon vaale style main
 
 upar vaale kii marzi ke bina ek patta hill nahin saktaa, bijli kii bakaayaa bill jamaa karaane kaa isse acha mauqaa mil nahin saktaa
 
 
 The melody of the song plays in the middle
 phir kalakaar bolta he- neend aane se pehle insaan so nahin saktaa, jiskaa bill jamaa he uske ghar main andhera ho nahin saktaa
 
 
 Man has come alone in this world, he will go alone, who will not deposit electricity bill, his house will be dark
 
 
 
 Then a song from the film 'pyaar Ki Jeet' starts playing - today let my love be won

 music chalane lagata he
 
 phir anounsar bolta he- ye acha or sunaharaa mauqaa he aap sab ke liye
 
 
 Then the song starts playing on the loudspeaker
 
 Let me make the name of the Wafa common
 
 
 
 
 phir uske baad jiuun yaa mar jaaun main
 
 
 The Announcer then speaks the next verse - Siri is on one side and Pan is on the other side, this is the life of the power house Khakherru
 
 
 thodaa music chalata he
 Then the artist speaks the next shayari - death cannot come before the time, the light of this power house can never go out
 
 
 gaanaa chalata he- jism ko mere aaj nilaam ho jane do
 
 
 The Announcer says- All of you are advised to submit your bills immediately in installments
 
 
 wo aage kahata he- ek baat bilkul saafe he sarkaar kii taraf se byaaz maaf he
 Interest will not be charged
 aaf kahenge kyon nahin lagegaa? to bhai nahin lagegaa eemaandaaree se

 Who would remember the names of weapons? upar se goli or aansu gas ke gole kii expagori date kab nikal gai yaad hi nahin
 Now what would you expect from the UP police in such a situation? You can only say that Yogi ji's police is really amazing
 ab koi bura naa maan jaae to lage haath ye bhi bataa duun ki upi police kii itani sari kabalidat kii pole-pattee koi or nahin balki khud upi police hi khol rahi he
 Actually, one of the officers of UP police felt that let's take a test of our team
 ab us test main kya-kya hota he ye dekhne laayak he
 Yogi ji was saying that he will make the police of Uttar Pradesh so that the police department of New York itself will come and ask how brothers are doing
 to ab upi police ke is sikret formule par se pardaa hatane vaala he
 Because we are now going to show you how the UP police does
 sabase pehle pashchimi upi ke bijanour zile ke nazibabad thane kii training kii jhalak dekhie
 Where Bijnor's CO Arun Kumar had said that long before coming, he was coming to inspect
 nirikshan kii shuruuaat upi ke in daroga ji se hui
 Daroga ji was given a palette gun and told to drive
 are ye kya ye miss ho gai
 CO Sabah shouted
 ek arse se sarkaar ne ye pallate gan thane ko di hui he
 The Divan Saheb of the police station also kept it safe
 par naa dewan sahab se matlab
 No means to inspector sir
 chal rahi he naukari
 Let it go
 thanedaar ne chalaai, lekin ye kya sahab phir kah rahe hai ki oh maai god
 
 phir miss ho gai
 But now how to fire next
 goli kahaan lagegi
 Please tell someone
 sahab thanedaar se bole, ab bandook neeche karo
 Change the bullet vahaan khadey hokar ye sab dekh rahe dewan sahab kii to jaise izzat par ban ai
 He snatched the gun from the Thanedar and started aiming himself
 magar ye kya dewan ne goli to chalaai lekin phuss ho gai
 Now the Inspecting Officer finally said, "let it be done
" chaliye ab duusari bandook tri karte hai
 No one will speak
 ek to sio sahab sir par khadey hai
 There is insult to other colleagues from above
 chaliye kam se kam inspector sahab ko ye to pataa hoga hi ki ye bandook chalati kaise he
 Sir asked - tell me how to run it
 or is bandook ko kehete kya hai
 Today Sardar ji is stuck in difficulty
 kyonki sio sahab ke kisi bhi sawaal kaa jawaab inspector sahab ke paas nahin he
 Sahab asked furiously, what do the first work do
 dewan sahab baar-baar inspector sahab kii madad karne kii koshish kar rahe hai
 But the Seo Sahab silenced him
 kareeb 15 se 20 minute ke test ke baad ye tay hua ki inspector sahab ko to naa bandook chalaanaa aata he auki naa hi uske bare main unhen kuch pataa he
 Sahab told his staff "write about all this
 
 
 shunya jaankaree he
 "well now the information of Inspector Sahab is zero
 lihaaza esao sahab ne nirikshan karne ke bajaae hathiyaaron kii jaankaree deni shuru kar di
 But even after explaining and telling SO sir, Inspector Saheb could not fire the gun
 kul milakar ek kambal par bichhe asalhe or barood ne upi police ke in javaanon ke zamir kii dhajjiyaan uda di
 The CO had to say in compulsion - if you do not practice, you will be dismissed
 aisa nahin he ki sio sahab thane main kisi khaas inspector kaa inspection karne aae ho
 Rather, his proper inspection was for the preparation of police stations and policemen
 lihaaza ab baari thi thane ke duusare police waalon ke saamaanya or practil gyaan kaa
 He asked the same inspector of the police station, what is the name of this person
 lijie sahab inspector sahab to bandook kaa naam tak nahin jaanate
 So how will they run it? haathon main tear gas chalaane vaali bandook lekar bhi inspector sahab ye nahin bataa paae ki use kehete kya hai
 CO sir again fell away and said - Leave it, you will not be able to do it
 ab baari thi thane ke duusare inspector kii
 In whose hands tear gas shells were given
 poocha gaya ki sahab ise chalaate kaise hai
 So see what the inspector said
 unhone kaha ki aansu gas chalaayenge or sahab let jaaenge
 CO sir fired the question- will you lie down after firing tear gas? Then CO sir started everyone's class
 hathiyaaron ke saamaanya gyaan main upi police ke javaanon kaa str kya he
 Except the two policemen of the police station, the other policemen could not open the pistol and other rifles and close them again
 or naa hi unhen hathiyaaron ke naam tak pataa the
 After inspecting the soldiers, the officer proceeded
 hathiyaaron kaa nirikshan kiya gaya to kya saamne aayaa
 It turned out that many guns and grenades are around four years old
 kaartoos kharaab ho chuke hai
 Tear gas shells were also cheated
 ab to sio arun kumaar buree tarah jhalla uthe or bole- ye saare expire ho chuke hai
 Actually, this visit was to inspect Arun Kumar, a CO of Bijnor who had reached Najibabad police station
 ab sochie bhala thane main agar kisi immergency se nipatane ke liye jawan hi taiyaar naa hon or unke hathiyaar bhi expyri date ke hon to bulandshahr or gajipur jaisi ghatnaayen agar huin to usamen hairaani kisi
 Perhaps the result of this half-completed preparation was the death of Inspector Subodh Kumar in Bulandshahr
 or gajipur main sipaahi suresh vatsa kii maut ho gai
 Overall, there is just such a problem in the police stations and jawans of UP police
 baaki sab thik he

 narendra modi sarkaar ke beete teen saal kii uplabdhiyon main pradhanmantri ujjwala yojana behad ahm rahi
 After the formation of the BJP government at the Center, the initiative to transfer subsidy directly to the account started, through which the campaign to prevent fake connections was launched and the government saved Rs 21,000 crore
 dhire-dhire petroleum mantri dharmendra pradhan kii pahal par shuru hui yah yojana kendra sarkaar kii flagship yojana ban gai
 In March 2015, Prime Minister Narendra Modi appealed to 'give it up' at the Energy Sangam program of the Ministry of Petroleum
 unhone sampann logon se alpiji kii sabsidi chhodie kii apil kii, lekin pradhan ke mutabik, pradhanmantri ne us kaarykram main jo kaha ki ''give it ap se jo paisa bachegaa vah sarkaar kii tijori main nahin balki garibon ko duungaa,'' or yaheen se ujjwala yojana kaa dhaancha taiyaar hua
 The falling prices of petrol and gas in the international market became a big gift for the Modi government
 modi sarkaar ne indhan bill main hui is bachat kaa istemaal garibon ko rasoi gas conection dene ke liye kiya
 This includes Rs 1,000 crore from CSR funds of oil companies
 pool kiya gaya or kareeb 65 lakh nae conection baante gaye
 After seeing enthusiasm in the BPL families, the government devised a strategy to pursue it as a concrete plan
 ise bhi padhein: iconomi ke front par kahin jorge bush jaise maat na kha jaaen narendra modipetroleum mantri ujjwala yojana se kisi bhi rajnatik laabh se inkaar karte hai
 They believe that this plan will be a vision of socio-political change
 isse mahila shashaktikaran or paryaavaran kii suraksha ke alaava swasthya kharch main kami aegi
 Due to the time spent in cooking, it can be used for other productive activities
 modi sarkaar kii yah pehali aisi yojana he jo upie sarkaar kii manaregaa kii tarah pratyaksh rup se ghar tak pahunchane vaali he
 Therefore, the government has set a target of reaching 50 million BPL families before the 2019 general elections
 vahiin is yojana se modi sarkaar ko sabase bada phayda kerosene sabsidi main katautee karne main mila he
 Significantly, according to Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan, no two subsidies can be given to anyone in the country simultaneously
 lihaaja, jaise-jaise ujjwala ke tahat desh main alpiji silendar kaa vistaar hoga, vaise-vaise kerosene par di jane vaali badi sabsidi se kendra sarkaar ko chhutkaaraa mil jayega
 However, the Modi government claims that the scheme does not have a political side
 lekin yah bhi hakeekat he ki ujjwala yojana kii safalataa ke chalate hi modi sarkaar ise 2019 ke aam chunaavon main garib votaron ko rijhaane se nahin chukenge
 Therefore, due to this success of this Dharmendra Pradhan, he got the status of a successful minister in the Modi cabinet, while his promotion was also decided
 kendriya sadak evam rashtriya rajmarg mantri nitin gadakari ne is baat se inkaar kiya ki i-rickshaw nirmaan kshetra se unke kisi tarah ke vanijyik hit jude hai

 li se koi rishta he, jiske bare main media ke varg main kaha gaya he ki usne bydaree chaalit rickshaw ke nirmaan main ruchi dikhaai he
 According to a statement issued by the BJP headquarters on behalf of its former president, battery-powered e-rickshaws have been in operation in many parts of the country for many years and are extensively manufactured in many states
 dilli rashtriya rajdhani kshetra or desh ke vibhinn hisson main do lakh se zyada i-rickshaw chal rahe hai
 According to the statement, the task of manufacturing e-rickshaws has been given only to the manufacturers who have got the license from the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR)
 isamen kaha gaya ki i-rickshaw nirmaan ke liye license dene kaa kaam siesaiaar kaa he or agar koi form iskaa utpaadan karnaa chaahati he to vah license ke liye siesaiaar se aavedan kar sakati he
 According to the statement, neither Gadkari nor any member of his family is associated with any e-rickshaw manufacturing firm

 Businessmen may have to wait longer for a cut in corporate tax
 apane chunavi vaade ko puraa karne ke liye pradhanmantri narendra modi ke paas kaaphi kam gunjaaish he
 The reason for this is that the Modi government has to face the problem of revenue reduction
 aise main uski taraf se corporate tex ko 30 fisadi se ghataakar 25 fisadi karne kii gunjaaish naa ke baraabar he
 This is the last full budget of the government before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 bajet ke baad kai rajyon main chunaav or agle saal loksabhaa chunaavon ko dekhakar ye ummid jataai ja rahi he ki yah bajet loklubhaavan hoga
 However, it will not be easy for the government to do so in view of the sluggish economy of the economy and the reduction in revenue of the government
 bloomberg ne apni ek report main kaha he kiindustries ko corporate taxmen katautee ke liye abhi or intjaar karnaa pad saktaa he
 PM Modi promised corporate tax cuts in 2015, 4 years ago
 haalanki pichley 4 saal ke dauraan vah is morche par koi rodmap bhi taiyaar nahin kar paae hai
 Constant new reforms are being done by the government to do business in the country
 laal fitaashahee main kami laane ke saath hi bed lone recovery kii raftaar bhi badi he
 This has given India very good news on the rating front from international institutions
 lekin ghar main arthvyavastha kii kai chunautiyaan modi sarkaar ke saamne khadi hai
 Necessary government to increase investment Government is engaged in increasing foreign investment in the country
 piem narendra modi ne daavos main bhi videshi companiyon ko bharat main nivesh karne ke liye nyauta diya he
 Its emphasis is on removing other barriers of business including corporate tax to increase investment, but the lack of revenue has made this task quite difficult
 2019 caloksabhaa chunaavako dekhte hue yah tay mana ja rahaa he ki is bajet main sarkaar kaa focus krishi kshetra par rahegaa
 Economic survey also emphasizes on improving the condition of agriculture
 vitt mantri arun jetali bhi is taraf sanket de chuke hai
 In such a budget, the allocation for agriculture sector can increase
 bharat ke saamne duusare desh bhi chunauti banakar ubhar rahe hai
 Other countries are constantly working to improve the environment for business by reducing corporate tax
 agar bharat duniya kii badi-badi companiyon ko apane desh main bulaanaa chahta he
 If it wants to increase investment, it will also have to take steps like corporate tax exemption
 haalanki philhal ye hota nahin dikh rahaa he

 chunavi jang main baaji apane naam karne ke liye rahul gandhi ne duniya kii sabase badinunatam aay guarantee yojana (the minimum income guarantee scheme) kaa vaada kiya or kaha ki agar unki sarkaar satta main aati he to garib pariwaron ko salanaa 72 hajaar rupee milenge

 12000 per month
" congress guarantee detii he ki vah desh main 20 fisadi sabase garib pariwaron main se prayek ko har saal 72000 rupee degi
 This money will be put directly into their bank account

 Gandhi said that the entire assessment had been done
 sab kuch tay kar liya gaya
 He said that this would benefit five crore families i

 25 crore people
 rahul ne kaha ki hindustan main agar miniman inakam se kam aamadani he to yah aay badhaane kii koshish hogi
 Which can be removed from poverty

 We will show this plan by bringing it forward

 One for the Anil Ambani flag and the other for poverty
 21veen sadi main hindustan main is desh main garibi ko hataanaa he
 This is not a scheme, it is now the last stop on poverty
 ham do hindustan nahin banane denge, yah amiron or garibon donon kaa hi desh hoga
 i do not want to become a Mahatma, i will not let two Hindustan become
 garibon ko bhi izzat dilaanaa chahta hum

 In fact, after the alliance between the SP and the BSP was fixed and the seat-sharing data was leaked, there was a sudden political boom on the alliance
 samaajawaadee party ne philhal is maamle par viraam lagane kii koshish kii he, lakhanu main party pravaktaa sunil saajan ne kaha ki congress gathbandhan kaa hissaa hogi yaa nahin hogi, abhi is par kuch bhi tay nahin hua he or iskaa aakhri faisla akhilesh yadav hi lenge
 On the other hand, in Delhi too, Samajwadi Party leader Ram Gopal Yadav also denied the news of keeping Congress out of the alliance and said that nothing has been decided yet
 bataa de ki uttar pradesh main espi or bispi donon hi congress ko alag ladate dekhnaa chaahate hai, taaki bijepi ke voton kaa bantwaaraa ho sake
 After the alliance, both these parties have got the benefit of separate fighting of the Congress in Gorakhpur and Phulpur
 aise main party ke sutara yah bataate hai ki donon partiyaan congress ke liye amethi or raibareli seat chhod dena chaahati hai, jabaki baaki siton par espi, bispi or areldi kaa gathbandhan banaae rakhana chaahati hai
 When BSP supremo Mayawati decided not to ally with Congress in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, Akhilesh Yadav had also decided not to ally with Congress in Madhya Pradesh
 haalanki jeet ke baad dono dalon ne congress ko bina maange apana samarthan diya
 Neither reached himself nor sent any big leader in the swearing in of the three chief ministers of Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati Congress
 aise main gathbandhan par bada sawaal khadaa ho gaya
 UP Congress leader and spokesperson Akhilesh Pratap Singh says that the news of keeping the Congress separate from the alliance is a conspiracy while the truth is that there is no final conversation about the alliance between the three parties

 Amla, who has always been successful against India, is playing 116 runs, which is the 12th century of his career
 unhone ab tak 180 gend kaa saamana karke nau chauke or ek chakka jamaaya he
 Kallis then played in his evergreen style and scored an unbeaten 102 to complete his 38th century
 unki 144 gend kii pari main nau chauke or teen chakke shaamil hai
 The duo put together a fine start from captain Graeme Smith (62) and Elviro Peterson (77) to form an unbroken 200-run partnership for the third wicket, leaving South Africa 366 for two at the end of the second day's play
 Make a big move towards it
 bhartiya team subah 136 ran par dher ho gayi thi or is tarah se dakshin africa ko 230 ran kii badhat hasil ho gayi he
 Like the batsmen, India were also disappointed by the bowlers and failed to make an impact like Morne Morkel or Dale Steyn
 bharat ko donon safaltaaen harbhajan singh ne dilaayi lekin vah ballebaajon par dabaav nahin bana paye
 South Africa needed only three balls to cover the Indian innings

 Stan took three wickets for 34 runs yesterday

 Harbhajan got India's first success by dismissing Smith in the last over before lunch
 dakshin africa captain ne turn leti gend ko cat karne kaa prayaas kiya, lekin vah unke balle kaa kinaaraa lekar dhoni ke dastaanon main chali gayi
 He faced 87 balls in his innings and hit 11 fours
 shuru main satark hokar khilne vaale petersan ne ishanth sharma par hook karke pehla aakraamak shaat khelaa
 After this, his confidence gradually increased and he played some reliable shots
 unhone harbhajan ko vishesh rup se nishaanaa banaaya or is aaf spinner par chakka bhi jadaa
 Pietersen and Amla shared a 55-run partnership for the second wicket after tea
 is saajhedaari ko todane kaa shrey bhi harbhajan ko hi mila, jinaki middle or leg stump par flite leti gend ko dephend karne ke liye petersan thodaa aage bade, lekin vah unke balle or pad se lagakar farward short leg par gambhir ke haathon main chali gayi
 He played 114 balls in his innings and hit nine fours and a six
 kallis ne srisanth par chaukaa jadkar aakraamak ravaiya apanaaya
 When Dhoni handed the ball to Suresh Raina, he welcomed this improvised spinner with two sixes
 kallis ne 30 ran puure karte hi 2010 main apane 1000 ran bhi puure kiye
 He soon left his fellow batsman Amla behind after Ishant hit two fours in one over
 bharat ne 80wein over ke baad nayi gend lee, lekin ballebaajon par iskaa asar nahin padaa tathaa kallis ne agle over main srisanth kii gend par cover main do ran lekar bharat ke khilaaf chauthaa shatak puraa kiya

 Kallis had achieved this feat before him
 unhone bhi kallis ke turant baad agle over main hi apane karier kaa 12waan or bharat ke khilaaf paanchvaan shatak puraa kar diya

 Within just 30 days, two incidents of communal and ethnic violence here have riddled the social fabric of this normally quiet district
 pehle sadak doodhli gaanv main sampradayik hinsa kii ghatana saamne ai, phir iske baad 5 may ko yahaan shabbirpur gaanv main jaateey hinsa hui
 After this, arson, sabotage and stone pelting occurred in Saharanpur in the name of Mahapanchayat of Dalits
 saharanpur main hui 9 may ko hui is ghatana ke peeche bhim army kaa naam saamne aayaa he
 Several firs of the organization have been registered in the FIR lodged by Saharanpur Police, including the founder of Bhima Army, Chandrashekhar and District President of Bhima Army
 aarope he ki 5 may ko shabbirpur main daliton ke ghar kii aagjanee ke virodh main bhim army ne 9 may ko saharanpur ke ravidaas chatravaas main daliton kii mahapanchayat bulaai thi
 This Mahapanchayat was not allowed to administer, due to which the Bhim Army activists and their Dalit supporters who were reaching the hostel were chased by the police
 police dwaara bhagaae jane ke baad bhim army ke kaaryakarta or kai dalit samarthak saharanpur ke gandhi maidan gaye
 The incident, which took place between the police and the Bhima Army at Gandhi Maidan, reached lathi charge and stone pelting
 saharanpur police dwaara darj FIR ke mutabik, lathicharge se bidke bhim army ke kaaryakartaaon or unke dalit samarthakon ne ilaake main kai motorcykilon main aag laga di or eent pathar giraakar kai raaston ko jam kar diya
 After this incident, the Saharanpur police registered an FIR, after which the Bhim Army founder Chandrashekhar and many of its leaders and activists are absconding, whom the police are still looking for
 aaj tak isse pehle aapkobhim army ke bare main bataa chukaahe, jo khud ko daliton kaa sangrakshak kahata he
 After the violence in Kabirpur village and its impact in Saharanpur, Aaj Tak team reached the national president of Bhima Army Unity Mission Vinay Ratna
 bhim army kaa sansthaapak chandrashekhar faraar hai, lekin uske kuch netaa or kaaryakarta saharanpur shahar main abhi bhi maujuud hai
 When the Aaj Tak correspondent asked questions on the May 9 incident, Vinay Ratna flatly denied the Bhima Army being behind the violence
 itnaa hi nahin bhim army kaa aarope he ki police uske sansthaapak chandrashekhar ko muthbhed main maar dena chaahati he
 At the same time, Vinay was asked about the convening of Mahapanchayat of Bhima Army, he said, 'we had called Mahapanchayat at Ravidas Hostel on 9 May, for which an application was given to SDM'
 haalanki vinay ratna ne yah bhi kabool kiya ki us mahapanchayat ke liye unhen prashasnic anumati nahin mili thi or is par sawaal puche jane par vinay ne 5 may ko shabbirpur main hui hinsa kaa hawala dete hue kaha ki vahaan par bhi yatra nikaalane or daliton kaa ghar jalaane ke liye kisi ne prashasnic anumati nahin lee thi
 Bhim Army national president Vinay Ratan said that the police first lathi-charged his workers reaching the hostel and on being driven from there, Gandhi also lathi-charged the people reaching the ground
 vahiin bhim army ke kaaryakarta dwaara is tarah kanoon apane haath main lene ke sawaal par vinay ratna kehete hai ki unhone kanoon ko apane haath main nahin liya, balki police ne unke saath jyaadati kii
 He said that outsiders crowded among the students pelted stones and acted to discredit the Bhima Army
 vinay kaa daawa he ki bhim army shabbirpur gaanv main jin daliton ke ghar jalaae gaye, unke liye muaavje kii maang kar rahi thi
 Whatever Vinay's claim is, the Saharanpur police are currently looking for big leaders and activists of the Bhima Army in the incident on May 9
 haalanki is maamle main police ab tak kai giraftaaryaan kar chuki he
 There have been serious revelations in the initial investigation of the Mathura case, about which the police department of UP can directly come under the scanner
 sutron se mili jaankaree ke mutabik, jaanch adhikariyon ne paaya he ki hinsa bhadakne or isse nipatane ke kram main police kii yojana main gambhir kamiyaan thim
 Not only this, the officer has also reached the conclusion that when the SP and SOR were attacked, the other officers present there fled their responsibility
 bataaya jaataa he ki jawaharbagh pahunchane se pehle police ko vahaan maujuudakabjaayiyonke bare main acchhee tarah se intelligence input bhi nahin di gai
 The police did not even know exactly how many people are present there, what and how many weapons they have
 haalanki aligarh ke police kamishnar kii dekharekh main jaanch abhi jari he
 He will submit his report in a few days
 jab espi ko peeta ja rahaa tha, sirf esao bachaane aebataya jaataa he ki jab jawaharbagh main hinsa bhadki, tab vahaan espi city mukud dvivedi ke saath aath varisht pulicekarmi maujuud the
 But when the miscreants started beating the SP, only SO Santosh Yadav tried to save them
 haalanki is kram menupadraviyone unki bhi hatya kar di
 Investigating officers are also going to question those police officers in the case and it is very likely that action will be taken soon

 They also tortured and punished the prisoners for breaking their rules
 yahi nahin, in atikaramanakariyon ne bharat kaa samvidhan or kanoon maanane se inkaar kar diya tha
 The miscreants had set up settlements, used to sell goods at low prices, said Durga Charan Mishra, Inspector General of Police (IG) of Agra Zone, "they had settled their colonies and the food items were provided there at a very low cost

 He gave a 'double meaning' speech in front of hundreds of students and teachers at Jhabua's program
 haalanki netaa ji ne maafee maang lee or kaha ki unke bhaashan ko tod marod kar pesh kiya gaya
 Vijay Shah allegedly put the BJP government in the state in an uncomfortable position by giving a 'double meaning' speech at an event attended by hundreds of teachers and girl students in Jhabua
 apane vivaadaaspad bhaashan ke baad shah ne kaha, ‘agar mere bhaashan se kisi ko thodaa sa bhi dukh hua ho, to main iske liye 10 baar maafee maangata hum

 ’pradesh ke aadim jati or anusuchit jati kalyaan mantri ne daawa kiya ki unke bhaashan ko media ke ek hisse main ‘tod-marodakar’ pesh kiya gaya
 But when asked what he had actually said during his speech, he said, 'I don't want to get into this affair anymore

 The Captain said that it is for this reason that he wants the investigation of the case to be with the State Police and not be handed over to the CBI
 raajnneetik dabaav kii vajah se kisi ko bhi is maamle main raahat na mili
 Captain Amarinder has said that he will continue to oppose the case being given to the CBI in court as well

 Amarinder had already given the clarification, he said in a statement, 'I never said that Prakash Singh Badal or his son Sukhbir were not involved in disharmony
 maine bas ye kaha he ki badal ne khud jaakar pavitra guru granth sahib ko nahin phada tha, lekin yah maamle main unki sanliptata ko nahin nakaarta
 The Chief Minister said, "they (badal) were as responsible as the people who were actually involved in the disharmony, after which the state and its people had to face serious incidents
" 'unhone kaha ki badal parivaar na keval apni nigaraanee main bade paimaane par hui brudabi ke maamalon ko rokane main naakaam rahaa balki doshiyon ko bhi bina kisi sajaa ke chhod diya gaya
 The Chief Minister said that due to being in power at that time, the Badal family was fully responsible for this
 singh ne kaha ki badal parivaar isse pallaa nahin jhaad saktaa

 Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has made up his mind to give 80% reservation to the students of the national capital in all the government-run universities and colleges and has also ordered the Education Minister of Delhi to find a way out
 is pahal se jahaan dilli ke chaatro main khushi he, vahiin desh ke anya rajyon ke chaatr maayoos hai

 uskaa kahana he ki vah unke saath aisa kaise kar sakate hai? ham achche anko ke liye din raat mehnat karte hai or rajdhani ke college main daakhila merit ke aadhaar par hota he
 Students of Delhi should also work hard and take admission
 agar sabhi rajyon ke college main aarakshan ho jayega, to desh kaa koi bhi chaatr kahin or daakhil nahin le paaegaa

 President of Delhi Imam Association Sajid Rashid said that innocent children are raised in the name of terrorism
 phir saalon cese chalane ke baad ve nirdosh sabit hote hai, lekin unki jindagi kharaab ho jaati he

 The Shiv Sena has suddenly opposed the unanimously approved proposal at the NDA meeting
 party pramukh uddhav thakare ne mumbai main yojit party kaaryakartaaon ke sammelan main apni bhoomika rakhi
 The NDA meeting was called in New Delhi in the second week of April
 is baithak main kendriya mantri or lokjanshkti party ke adhyaksh ramvilas paswan kii aguwai main yah prastaav sarvasammat hua ki NDA 2019 main bhi narendra modi ke netritv main chunaav ladegi
 Uddhav Thackeray, who arrived in New Delhi to attend this meeting, then accepted this proposal
 
 But, 22 days after this meeting of the NDA, Uddhav is finding this proposal to be a force
 buudhvaar ko mumbai main unhone kaha, ramvilas paswan ne jabaran likhvaya ki 2019 main modi ke netritv main ladenge
 Why so hasty? The support that has been received today should come in the work of the country
 vaise chunaav main abhi 2 saal baaki hai
 Why such a hurry to impose his leadership? Such decisions were never accepted by the Shiv Sena
 tippaniyan Uddhav expressed concern about the current situation in his speech
 unhone kaha, chunaav se pehle chaay par charchaa or chunaav ke baad gaay par charchaa
 By the way, if the country is saved, will we all survive? aaj bijepi ko log chunakar de rahe hai
 If the expectations from the BJP are not fulfilled, remember the farmer will flare up
 kaaryakarta prashikshan shivi kaa samarope buudhvaar ko uddhav thakare ke bhaashan se hua
 Earlier in his inauguration speech on Tuesday, Uddhav had said that Narendra Modi should leave his mind and talk to Pakistan with guns
 april maheene ke duusare hafte main nai dilli main NDA kii baithak bulaai gai thi
 In this meeting, the proposal led by Union Minister and Lok Janshakti Party President Ram Vilas Paswan was unanimous that the NDA will contest elections under the leadership of Narendra Modi in 2019 also
 is baithak main shariq hone nai dilli pahunche uddhav thakare ne tab is prastaav ko sweekaar kiya tha
 
 lekin, NDA kii is baithak ke 22 din ke baad uddhav ko yah prastaav jabardastee kaa prastaav lag rahaa he
 In Mumbai on Wednesday, he said, Ram Vilas Paswan forcibly wrote that he will fight under Modi's leadership in 2019
 itani jaldbaaji kyon? aaj jo samarthan mila he wo desh ke kaam main aana chahie
 Well, there are 2 years left in the election
 apane netritv ko thopane kii itani jaldbaazi kyon? aise faisle shivasena ko kadaapi manjuur nahin
 The comments uddhav ne apane bhaashan main maujuuda halaat ko lekar chintaa jaahir kii
 He said, discuss tea before the election and a discussion on the cow after the election
 vaise, desh bachegaa to gaay kya ham sab bachenge
 Today people are giving it to the BJP by electing it
 agar bijepi se ummiden puri na hui to yaad rakhie kisaan bhadak uthegaa
 Worker training camp was concluded on Wednesday with Uddhav Thackeray's speech

 pradooshan se behaal dilli ko bachaane ko lekar jitani koshishen ho rahi hai, usase kahin zyada tej siyaasi jang ho rahi he
 BJP is trying to corner the Kejriwal government on the issue of not using environmental tax money and failing to stop pollution
 ab bijepi ne elaan kiya he ki wo somvaar ko supreme court main yachika daayar karegi, jisamen bataaegi ki kaise dilli sarkaar paryaaran tex ke naam par vasule gaye 700 karod rupee ko apni tijori main band karke baithi rahi or dilli main pradooshan ko rokane ke koi upaay nahin kiye
 Delhi BJP President Manoj Tiwari said that when the Supreme Court imposed environment cess on commercial vehicles entering Delhi, then it was clear that the money recovered was used to improve Delhi's air and improve public transport
 Will be spent saath hi court nedilli sarkaarase ye bhi kaha tha ki har teen maheene main sarkaar is fund or iske istemaal ko lekar court ko jaankaree bhi de
 Manoj Tiwari alleges that the government has spent only 93 crores out of the over 700 crores recovered, so that it is clear that the government was sitting on its hands and Delhi took control
 manoj tiwari ne kaha ki kejariwal dilli kii janata se emsidi chunaav main mili haar kaa badla le rahe hai
 Leader of the Opposition in Delhi Legislative Assembly Vijendra Gupta also held a press conference, accusing the Delhi government of misleading Delhiites on the matter of public transport
 vijendra gupta ne kaha ki sarkaar apni naakaami chupaane ke liye kahati he ki uske paas ditisi kii bason ko park karne ke liye jagah nahin he or alji 132 acre jameen nahin de rahe hai, jabaki hakeekat ye he ki khuddilli sarkaarake paas 260 acre jameen maujuud he, jis par 7000 se zyada basen park ho sakati hai
 Vijender Gupta said that Kejriwal's intention is not to facilitate the people of Delhi, to strengthen public transporters but to shine his politics by taking sympathy from the people of Delhi

 It is clear that before the elections in Gujarat, both the BJP and the Congress are trying to forget the issue of unemployed, poor and development of Gujarat and save their vote bank
