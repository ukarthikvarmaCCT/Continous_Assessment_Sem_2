 Jio ne samar sarprise ofer ko waapas lene kaa elaan kiya he
 That is, the free service of Jio, which has been running for 200 days, has now officially ended
 haalanki colling free milti rahegi kuch samay tak
 There are many conditions in this too, we will explain further
 haalaaki abhi bhi aap is ofer kaa laabh le sakate hai, isliye abhi ke liye yah khatm nahin hua he, sirf elaan bhar hua he
 After this 'surprise' spread of Jio, many questions are arising in Jio users Cayman
 sawaal ye he ki kya ab prime member nahin ban sakate? kya pehle 303 rupee kaa richarge karaayaa tha to bhi samar sarprise ofai nahin milegaa?aise hi sawaalon ke jawaab ek ek karke ham aapako dete hansarprise ofer ab nahin31 march ko jeeyo prime sarvice sabsakripshan kii aakhri taarikh tay kii gai thi
 But just before that, the company increased it to 15 April
 iske saath hi sarprise ofer pesh kiya gaya jisaki avadhi 3 maheene kii thi
 That is, anyone who recharges Rs 99 and Rs 303 by April 15 will get 1 GB of data and free calls every day for the next three months
 kyon khatm hua Jio Summer Surprise ofer?telecom regaulatory othurity of india (TRAI) ne Reliance Jio se sarprise ofer waapas lene ko kaha
 In response, the company said that it would listen to TRAI and withdraw this off
 iske baad jeeyo ne tatkaal statement jari karke ise waapas lene kaa elaan kar diya
 Still Jio Summer Surprise offer will be available, but Jio has withdrawn Summer Surprise, but people who have already subscribed to Prime Membership will get it
 haalanki prime member banane ke baad jinhone 303 kaa richarge karaayaa he unhen hi agle teen maheene tak ye ofai milegaa
 Those who had recharged for only 99 rupees or 99 + 149 rupees will not get this offer
 kya ab prime member ban sakate hai yugersojhio ne prime member banane kii aakhri taarikh 15 april kar di thi
 But after this decision, whether Jio users can now become prime members or not is not clear
 haalanki company ne apane statement main kaha he ki ise jaldi khatm kiya jayega
 According to reports, the company has not reduced the last date for taking prime membership
 isliye sambhav he ek yaa do din tak log prime membership ke liye register kara sakate hai
 If not, then obviously you have to be satisfied with the simple tariff of Jio
 aapke man main abhi koi sawaal he to coment box main hamen bataaen

 According to Ramalingam, even if a PPF account holder is in need of money, it is better to withdraw money from the bank's FD, because you are getting less interest than PPF

 Even if your income is not taxable, ie taxable, it is beneficial to pursue a PPF account
 
 
 " It is worth noting that the interest earned on fds or recurring deposits (RD or Recurring Deposit) made in banks or post offices is fully taxable, ie, income tax is to be paid on it
 
 
 gauratlab he ki bainkon yaa post offison main karai jane vaali epady yaa aavarti jamaa (RD yaa rikring dipoggit) par hasil byaaj puri tarah texable hota he, yani us par inakam tex dena padataa he

 According to the Aam Aadmi Party, it cannot be a part of any such front whose leaders are involved in corruption
 isse pehle party ke varisht netaa gopal raay ne ek samachar agency se baatcheet main kaha tha ki aam aadmi party chunaav ke nateezon ke baad bijepi ko rokane ke liye tisare morche kaa samarthan kar sakati he

" pichley kuch dinon main bijepi ko satta main aane se rokane ke liye dharmanirpeksh kahalaane vaali takaton ke saath main aane kii sambhaavna par baatcheet tej hui he
 SP President Mulayam Singh Yadav and many other leaders had expressed such a possibility

 When Health Minister Vishwajit Rane left the Congress to join the BJP in 2017, he said he respected Manohar Parrikar like a father
 par biimaar mukhyamantri ke liye rane pareshaani kaa sabab hi sabit hue hai
 In November last year, he had troubled the BJP by discussing Parrikar's pancreatic cancer
 ab, unhone yah daawa karke hadakamp machaa diya ki parrikar ne kaha tha ki unhen pad chhodie ke liye nahin kaha ja saktaa kyonki rafel vimaanon kii kharid se judi filein unke kabje main hai
 The Congress released an audio clip on 3 January in which Rane was allegedly discussing with a local journalist about the meeting of the state cabinet held about two months ago
 isamen rane ko yah kehete suna ja saktaa he, ''mukhyamantri ne bahut dilachasp baat kahi
 He claimed that Parrikar had said that all the files of Rafael were in his bedroom
 rane ne patrkaar se kaha, ''aap is par khabar bana sakate hai
 
 
 Cross-check with your source in the cabinet
 '' rane ko yah kehete suna ja saktaa he, ''iskaa matlab he ki ve (bhaajapa) unke (parrikar ke) dabaav main he
 
 
 He said that he has one document each of Rafael
 mujhe nahin pataa ki kya ve chaahate hai ki yah baat koi dilli tak pahunchaae
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi raised this matter in the Lok Sabha on the same day
 vahiin parrikar ne kaha ki us baithak main rafel par koi charchaa nahin hui thi jabaki rane ne daawa kiya ki unhen fansaane ke liye audio clip ke saath chhedchhad kii gai he
 City Planning Minister Vijay Sardesai, who was present at the meeting, refused to comment on it
 par kuch bhaajapa netaaon kaa maananaa he ki sambhav he ki parrikar ne baithak shuru hone se pehle anaupchaarik baatcheet main rafel par kuch kaha ho
 This was the first meeting of his cabinet after he returned from the US in June
 is 'anaupchaarik baatcheet' ko yaad karte hue, in netaaon ne daawa kiya ki kisi ne parrikar se poocha tha ki jab sarkaar mushkil main he to ve rafel par baat kyon nahin kar rahe hai
 According to him, the Chief Minister replied, "modiji is handling this issue properly
 mujhe hastkshep karne kii jarurat nahin he
 "another BJP leader, on the condition of anonymity, said he was not surprised at Rane's statement," Parrikar is accustomed to making big claims
 apana mahatv dikhaane ke liye ho saktaa he, unhone kuch kaha ho
 On January 3, Parrikar had spoken about conducting forensic tests to check the audio clip
 lekin us din aisa koi aadesh aayaa nahin
 Former Chief Minister Laxmikant Parsekar, who has been angry since his rival Dilip Sopte was inducted into the BJP, says the clip is a matter of concern and should be thoroughly investigated
 vahiin, dipti spikar maaikel lobo ne rane par chutki lete hue kaha ki girte paryaton or swasthya sevaaon par gambhirtha se dhyaan dene kii jarurat he, jabaki congress ke pradesh adhyaksh, girish chodankar ne vyangy karte hue parrikar ke liye zyada suraksha kii maang kii
 According to political observers, after this incident there is no possibility of Rane reaching the top post of Goa
 lekin chaar vidhansabha kshetron—valpoi, mouem, sankhaalee or dicholim—main unke prabhaav ke maddenjar uttari goa loksabhaa seat bachaae rakhane ke liye party ko unki jarurat hogi
 At the same time, troubled Rane tried to meet BJP President Amit Shah in Delhi on 5 January, but he could only meet with Union Minister for Women and Child Development Maneka Gandhi
 audio clip masalaa shiroda or mandrem main aagaamee vidhansabha upachunaavon main bhi bhaajapa ko nuksaan pahunchaa saktaa he
 Any possibility of Vishwajit Rane for the post of Chief Minister of Goa is now almost gone
 ve manohar parrikar ke vikalp kii daud main shaamil the

 ' vaishno devi yatra ko lekar congress ne modi sarkaar par hamalaa kya bolaa, chand ghante ke bheetar sarkaar ko us par apni safai pesh kerani padi
 Counting the difference between the words and actions of the Modi government, Congress spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi cited Jammu and Kashmir
 kaha ki baadh ke baad pradhanmantri modi ne 44 hazaar karod rupee kii madad kaa bharosa diya tha
 But in fact the help is very little reached
 isi kram main singhvi ne zikr kiya ki helicopter se vaishno devi kii yatra karne par kashmir kii bijepi-pidipi sarkaar ne 12
 Has imposed service tax of 5%
 singhvi ne poocha ki kya ye jazia kar he jo vaishno devi kii tirthayatra par jane vaale un tirth yatriyon ko dena padegaa jo kamazor or laachaar hai or paidal chal kar vahaan tak pahunch nahin sakate
 The comments gyaat ho ki mughal badshaah aurangzeb ne tirth yatra par jane vaale hindooon par jazia lagaaya tha
 The Congress used the word jaziya to strike two targets with one stone
 ek to hindu hit kii baat karne vaali bijepi par hindu hit ke viruddh kaam karne kaa aarope laga diya
 The second also took a step towards breaking the image of persistence in Muslim appeasement
 congress kii taraf se aae is bayaan ke baad sarkaar turant harakat main aayi
 a statement was first issued by Jitendra Singh, Minister of State for the Prime Minister's Office and then by BJP General Secretary Ram Madhav, that he was asked to review the matter by talking to the Deputy Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir
 zaahir he kendra sarkaar ne ise waapas karaane kii disha main koshish shuru kar di he
 It remains to be seen what the fellow PDP in the government shows in this direction
 modi sarkaar kii kathani or kerani main antar ginate hue congress pravaktaa abhishek manu singhvi ne jammu or kashmir kaa hawala diya
 It is said that after the flood, Prime Minister Modi had assured the help of 44 thousand crores rupees
 lekin vastav main madad bahut kam pahunchi he
 In the same sequence, Singhvi mentioned that the BJP-PDP government of Kashmir on the journey of Vaishno Devi by helicopter 12
 5% kaa sarvice tex laga diya he
 Singhvi asked if this is the Jiziya tax that would have to be paid to those pilgrims going on a pilgrimage to Vaishno Devi who are weak and helpless and cannot reach it on foot
 tippaniyan It is known that the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb imposed jizya on the Hindus going on pilgrimage

 2002 dangon ke baad modi ko vaajapeyi dwaara di gai 'rajdharm' vaali naseehat kaa zikr karte hue congress ne modi ke khilaaf ek artical apni website par daalaa he
 The title of this article is, 'no Buddy to Remind BJP of its Rajdharma'
 is lekh main vaajapeyi kii tasviir kaa bhi istemaal kiya gaya he
 The Congress has said, 'mr
 Modi did not follow Rajdharma
 purv pradhanmantri shri atal bihari vaajapeyi jis vyakti ko mukhyamantri pad ke yogya nahin samajhate the, kya aap desh kaa bhavishya us vyakti ke haathon main de sakate hai?'is lekh main kaha gaya he, 'bijepi main koi bhi netaa atal bihari vaajapeyi kii kad kaa nahin ho saktaa
 This founding president of the party held the reins of the country for 6 years
 2004 main congress ke haathon mili haar ke baad vaajapeyi ne khud mana tha ki modi ke kaarykaal main dangon kii vajah se unki haar hui
 He wanted to take action against Modi
 isaki pushti endie sarkaar main mantri rahe jaswant singh ne bhi kii thi
 Vajpayee even threatened to resign in the event of no action against Modi
 'lekh main aage likhaa he, 'vaajapeyi kii pidaa kii vajah thi ki modi kaa rajdharm kaa paalan na karnaa
 He did not perform his duties as Chief Minister
 vaajapeyi ne modi ko rajdharm ke paalan karne kii naseehat thi
 He was told not to divide people on the basis of caste, religion and color
 isse saaf he ki gujarat ke mukhyamantri dange rokane main to naakaam rahe hi saath main gujaratiyon ke saath bhedbhaav bhi kiya
 'at the end of this article it is written,' After knowing all this, the same question arises that when the biggest leaders of BJP wanted to remove that person from the post of Chief Minister, then how can he be the PM candidate of the party?

 samay ke saath-saath is network main phone kol se whatsapp yaa instagram massej kaa daur bhi aa gaya lekin taur-tarika mote taur par vahi he
 After the decade of terror and sonanbay, the matter became complicated due to the addition of gold smuggling and the mechanism of sending money to terrorist networks
 hawala aaj aatanki networkon kaa pasandida jariya he kyonki isamen koi electronic pahchaan nahin bachi rahati or isamen mul strot kaa pataa laga paanaa bhi mushkil he
 In this way, it is an ideal vehicle for terror-prone countries like Pakistan
 antarrashtriya hawala sampark tantra ke alaava iske gharelu channel bhi vistrut hai jisase aantarik lenden aasaan ho jaati he
 Nearly a decade ago in 2007, then-intelligence chief of the state Jacob Punnoose warned the Home Secretary in his five-page confidential report about racket of fake notes, hawala business and a National Development Front (NDF) front among fundamentalist Islamic groups
 Was
 endief popular front of india kaa mul sanghathan he
 He cited several case studies of hawala traders' close ties to the NDF
 us report par koi karrwai nahin hui
 Even in the recent case of 21 missing youths joining the Islamic State (IS) in Afghanistan, the NIA suspects that the amount of their visit was provided through hawala
 kuch police afasaron kaa kahana he ki jevaraat kaa dhandha bhi hawala kaarobaar or usase judi sone kii taskari kii madad letaa he
 Smuggling of gold helps hawala traders double their profits
 koduvalli ke ek hawala kaarobaari anwar ke mutabik, ''hawala network ko sone kii taskari ke liye ek karod ru
 Seven lakhs from planting
 kii kamai ho jaati he
 One Crore Rs
 se aapako dubai main ek-ek kilo ke teen baar mil jaaenge
 Gold can be landed at Kerala or Mumbai airports with the help of custom and airline crew
 " paanch saal main dubai or kerala ke bich sone kii taskari main ijapha hua he
 These couriers come in all cost
 23 janvari 2017 ko kochi ke custom vibhaag ne ek catholic padri francis ijac kijhakaparambil ko 300 gram sone kii baar ke saath pakadaa
 It was wrapped in a chocolate bar in her bag
 notebandi ke baad yah network 30 fisadi premium par puraane noton ko badalane laga
 One crore in old notes Rs
 dene par hawala kaarobaari 70 lakh ru
 Used to give in new notes
 yah rakam bainkon ke jariye badali jaati thi
 Of these, 10 per cent was given to bank employees and 20 per cent to hawala business
 anwar bataata he, ''ab jokhim ke mukaable hawala lenden adhik munaafedaar nahin rah gaya
 But with this there is good advantage in trades like gold smuggling, money laundering, real estate and fake notes
 "koduvalli main hawala or sone kii taskari ke sambandh khulkar dikhte hai
 Crazy for gold, it is strange to have 89 jewelery retail shops just 400 meters away on National Highway 766 in Kerala
 khufia reporton ke mutabik, kai hawala kaarobaari sone kii taskari ke network ke saath bhi kaam karte hai or paise real estate main bhi khapa rahe hai
 Abdul Naseer, the owner of Arabia Jewelers, proudly says, "it has the highest number of jewelery shops in the state
" " in dukaanon main kareeb 1,400 parivaar naukari kar rahe hai
 However, Nasir denies any connection in jewelery and hawala business and says that the villages here belong to sonars
 koduvalli main har roj takreeban 140 gram sone kii bikri to ho hi jaati thi lekin notebandi ke baad bikri shunya par aa giri (kyonki zyaadaatar lenden nakadi main hota he), lekin ab phir samanya kaarobaar lautne laga he
 But hawala is considered a white-collar crime despite its dark world, which does not cause any law and order problem in the state
 uski madad kamjor kanoon or bhrasht adhikari karte hai
 "we have a limited role in catching hawala traders," says a senior police officer
 jab bhi kisi badi rakam kii jabti hoti he, ham maamle ko pravartan nideshaalay ko supurd kar dete hai
 Due to loopholes in FEMA law, most hawala traders are exempted from paying some fines
 " amuman hawala kaarobaari koi statement pesh kar dete hai jisase aamadani ke strot kaa pataa chalata he yaa kuch jurmaana bhar kar chhot jate hai
 In this way, the black business of Kerala's "money tunnel" goes on unabated
 pakistan main juthi shaan ke liye hatya (honor kiling) kii haalia ghatnaon ke maddenjar republican party kii ore se raashtrapati pad ke ummidavaar donald trump ne kaha he ki agar vah nirvaachat hue to unka prashasan sabhi udaaravaadi muslim sudhaarkon kaa mitra hoga tathaa unki awaajon ko vistaar degaa

 In northern parts of the country, tomato prices have risen to Rs 60-70 per kg due to supply disruptions due to rain
 pyaaj kaa khudara bhav bhi 40 rupee kilo tak bolaa ja rahaa he
 Tomatoes are being sold at Rs 55 per kg and onions at Rs 29 per kg at successful Mother Dairy shops
 vahiin, khudara sabji bechney vaale tamaato 60 se 70 rupee kilo tathaa pyaaj 40 rupee kilo ke bhav bech rahe hai
 According to the data of the Department of Consumer Affairs, tomato is the most expensive in Bhopal where it has reached Rs 85 kg
 uske baad kanpur tathaa portblair kaa sthaan rahaa jahaan 80 rupee kilo bika
 According to traders, the wholesale price of tomatoes in Azadpur mandi is 45 to 50 rupees per kg, while the price of onion is slightly reduced from 20 to 25 rupees per kg

 After the Loksabha Election Results 2019 and the BJP (BJP) got immense success in this, new political equations have started to be formed
 kya maujuuda halaat main karnataka main satta parivartan hoga? kya jedies (JDS) netaa or mukhyamantri kumaraswami (kumaraswamy) congress (congress) kaa saath chhodkar bijepi ke saath milakar sarkaar banaaenge? is sawaal kaa jawaab talashne kii koshish karnataka ke siyaasi galiyare main bhi chal rahi he
 Will the political picture of Karnataka change? Will the JDS Congress continue or will it break? This question is arising because the Deve Gowda family considers Congress leader Siddaramaiah as the reason for the defeat of JDS supremo Deve Gowda and his grandson Nikhil Kumaraswamy
 kumaraswami mantrimandal kii anaupchaarik baithak main congress (congress) or jedies donon taraf se yah dikhaane kii koshish kii gai ki sab kuch thik thaak he or karnataka kii sarkaar main philhal koi badlaav nahin hone ja rahaa
 Deputy Chief Minister Parmeshwara said that the results of the elections have come from the Lok Sabha and not the Legislative Assembly
 aise main kuch bhi nahin badalane vaala
 JDS spokesman m Arivalgn said that Kumaraswamy wrote a letter to Rahul Gandhi saying that you form the government, we will support him
 lekin rahul gandhi ne kaha ki aap mukhyamantri agle chaar saalon tak bane rahenge
 Actually, BJP has its limits in Karnataka
 bijepi kaa kendriya netritv lingayat netaa yediurppa kii naaraazgi lene kii haalat main nahin he
 In Karnataka, BJP now has 105 mlas in the assembly and two independents are with it
 yediurppa ko jedies se haath milaane main koi parhez nahin he
 The condition is that he will become the chief minister
 kumaraswami (kumaraswamy) up mukhyamantri bane is par yediurppa ko aitaraaz nahin he
 The JDS, along with its 37 mlas and an MLA of the BSP, has kept the 38-seat party's Aupne Kunbe from manipulations
 congress ke aadha darjan vidhayak bhale hi palada badalane ko taiyaar hon lekin isse bijepi kaa sarkaar banane ke jaadui aankade tak pahunchnaa naammumkin he
 If the BJP breaks at least 13 mlas, then the number in the house will be 212
 yani bijepi 107 sadasyon ke saath bahumat sabit kar sakati he
 But it is not easy
 bijepi ke liye yediurppa ko mukhyamantri pad kii kursi chhodane ke liye manaanaa bhi aasaan nahin he
 That is, the BJP feels that President's rule can be a good choice either by falling the government or by somehow falling
 jedies congress gathbandhan main talmail kii kami lagaataar badhati ja rahi he
 The central leadership of the BJP wants it to adopt a policy of weight and watch for now so that the government itself falls and mid-term elections can be held here at the end of the year with the West Bengal Legislative Assembly

 He told the police that they were married 6 months ago
 lekin shaadi ke kuch dinon baad hi use puja par avaidh sambandh kaa shaq hone laga tha

 Twenty-six-year-old Zafar Iqbal and his less than half-year-old 26-year-old Sandeep Singh belong to two different phases of the game that have seen huge improvements in infrastructure and other facilities, but the results have fallen dramatically
 ikbaal 1980 main moscow olympic main gold medal jeetne vaali bhartiya hockey team kaa hissaa rahe hai, jabaki sandip singh ko landan olympic 2012 main sabase nichle paaydaan par rahane kii badanaami jhelni padi
 Associate Editor es
 In conversation with Vivek, both these hockey stars shed light on the condition of the national game, its past and present
 bhartiya hockey main lagaataar giravat aati ja rahi he
 Why? Zafar Iqbal: Long ago we were superpowers
 ham ab sudhaar ke liye kathor prayaas kar rahe hai, lekin duusare desh hamaare mukaable bahut teji se sudhaar kar rahe hai
 Now they have as many great players as we have had before
 hamaare paas kai aise umdaa khilaadi hai jo ek jagah par hi fite kar rahe hai
 Take the example of Sandeep himself
 vah vishwa stareey draig flikar he, lekin durbhaagya se aapako is desh main uski jagah lene vaala koi doosraa vyakti nahin mil rahaa
 We have 4-5 world class players, the rest are just average players
 aapako yadi olympic jeetna he to 11-12 vishwastareey khilaadi hone chahie jinke paas tej dimag, bharpoor stemina or raftaar ho
 Sandeep Singh: Many good players are coming, but we should have a back-up system
 jab tak ham kisi sambhavit back-ap khilaadi ko taiyaar karte hai, vah team se baahar ho jaataa he
 This is a big problem of our team
 team ke sadasyon ke prashikshan or kaam ke boj par acchhee tarah se najar rakhni chahie
 After the London Olympics, many people were hopeful of the medal after seeing several good performances
 lekin antim sthaan par rahakar team ne apni lokapriyata par batta laga diya
 Sandeep: The players worked hard to do well
 olympic kii taiyaari ke dauraan bhi hamaara prashikshan bahut acha chal rahaa tha or hamane kai match khele the
 Unfortunately we overcame it before the game and it went against us
 khilaadi ke taur par hamane apana sarvshereshth karne kaa prayaas kiya, lekin hamaari taiyaari kaa akalan galat sabit hua or ham thak gaye
 Zafar: i remember that India won the bronze medal in the 1968 Olympics
 un dinon bronj medal jeetne kii baat pachaana bahut mushkil hota tha
 Now any medal is seen as a bonus
 un dinon bronj medal jeetne ke baad hamen apana cheharaa chhupaakar ghoomana padataa tha
 We never used to walk with a hockey stick in our hands because people would know that we are hockey players and someone could have misbehaved with us
 log hockey main gold ke alaava or kisi medal ko tavajjo nahin dete the
 In the old days, the Prime Minister also used to go to club matches
 ab to hockey maichon main mushkil se hi darshak milte hai
 The youth are also unable to join hockey
 aakhir kyon?jafar:yah khel apni lokapriyata kho rahaa he kyonki yuva aise khelon ko tarjeeh de rahe hai jisamen zyada paisa ho
 Hockey India is going to start a league (HIL) so that hockey players can also earn some money
 aisi chijen bahut mahatvapurn hai
 Ranji Trophy cricketers are also getting more money from the players playing hockey from the country
 sandip, yah sawaal aapse he
 HIL is considered to be a big change
 aapke hisaab se aisi profeshnal lig se kis had tak paisa jute saktaa he or darshakon kii ruchi kaayam ho sakati he?sandip:log zyaadaatar vibhinn deshon ke bich match dekhne jate hai
 It will be a different experience for them to see good players from all over the world playing together
 hamaare khilaadi antarrashtriya sitaron se kaaphi kuch sikh paaenge or apni pratibha kaa pradarshan kar paaenge
 In India, fans' response is usually close to extreme
 sandip:jab aap haarate hai, to ve aapke paas aate hai or yah ummid karte hai ki aap haar kii vajah bataaen
 Sometimes they get angry, but mostly their attitude and their way of looking at you is changed
 olympic ke baad unka kahana tha ki unke paas aisi team he jo sabhi match haar gai
 But when you win, as we saw in the Commonwealth Games, people go crazy
 hockey is maamle main bhaagyashaalee rahi he ki ise ek bade varg kaa puraa samarthan mil rahaa he
 In fact, we were quite surprised to see the 2010 Commonwealth Games and even London 2012 full of stadiums
 mujhe ummid he ki hamen achche nattejey hasil honge or isaki khushi manaane vaale kattar samarthak bhi milenge
 Zafar: i think there is a huge change in the audience's thinking now compared to before
 mujhe bhi yah dekhakar tajjub hua ki ab bahut se darshak team kaa samarthan karne ke liye aate hai
 This is a big change compared to our era
 tab to log bahut naaraaz ho jate the
 When we lost, we had to listen to a lot of public abuse
 khilaadi aksar suvidhaon kii kami kaa ronaa rote hai
 This used to be very common in the seventies
 jafar:1982 ke asian khelon ke dauraan hamen usee neshnal stadium main hi tehraaya gaya tha, jahaan ham khelte the or hamen farsh par sona padataa tha
 No cots or coolers were available and the name of AC was not heard
 vishwa cap ke dauraan bhi ham stadium kii dormitary main thaharte the or saaf kahuun, hamen isse koi pareshaani mahasoos nahin hoti thi
 People around us used to get angry and raised the fact that the facilities we are entitled to are not being given
 hamaare paas kabhi koi video nahin tha
 We would go to the stadium to watch the games of the opposing teams and study their games
 us jamaane main training kai baar thakaa dene vaali hoti thi
 We were asked to make 40 rounds of a football field
 hamen baaluu main daudia padataa
 We had no psychologist or physiotherapist
 hamaare team ke coach baalakishan akele hi in sabaki jimmedaari sambhalate the
 Sandeep: Luckily a lot of things have got better now (smiles)
 hamen acchhee jagahon par tehraaya jaataa he
 We have a specialist trainer, a specialist dietician and a video analyst
 haa, hamaare paas bhi koi psychologist nahin he
 We really need it now so that we can become mentally strong
 jafar, desh main paidaa hue behtareen forward khiladinnon main se aap kisi bhi peedi kii team main feet ho sakate hai, lekin kya sandip bhi ek sarvakalik team main jagah paa sakate hai?jafar:jab ham europea tiimon se khelte the to hamen aksar 7-8 penalty corner milte, lekin ham mushkil se hi kisi ko gol main badal pate
 Then in the 70-minute game, we would have remained in the half of the opposing team for about 50 minutes, but could not take advantage of the short corner
 iske vipareet ve kabhi-kabhi aage jate hai or apane short corner ke maukey kaa phayda uthaate hai
 So yes, if Sandeep had been with us, we would have done much better
 sandip:dhanyavad, jafar bhai

 kohli ke kandhe par dohari jimmedaaridhoni ke anfit hone ke kaaran viraat kohli pehali baar test maichon main team india kii captaini karenge
 Wriddhiman Saha will be included in the team in place of Dhoni

 During the last tour, Kohli scored his first century of his Test career at this ground
 kohli se achche pradarshan kii ummid to rahegi hi, inke saath saath anya ballebaajon ko bhi acha pradarshan karnaa hoga
 Especially if the opener manages to give India a good start, then the series will be very interesting
 kya clark ke pradarshan par dikhegaa huge kii maut kaa asar?yah baat kisi se chuphi nahin he ki maaikel clark is samay australia ke sabase bharosemand cricketer hai
 His record against India has also been excellent

 This question is in the mind of every cricket lover
 agar edilade kii baat karen to is maidan par clark kaa balla khub chalaa he
 Clarke scored 98 in 9 Tests here
 38 kii shandaar everej se 1279 ran banaae hai
 Which includes 6 centuries
 ek baar phir bhartiya team ke liye sabase badi chunauti clark se paar paane kii rahagi
 Also, it would be extremely important to rein in David Warner, Steven Smith and Shane Watson

 As soon as this statement has come, there has been some heat in the series
 australian team ke paas mishael johnson, peter sidle or rain haris jaise gendaaj hai jo team india ke liye sabase badi chunauti hai
 Apart from playing these bowlers successfully, another challenge is facing Team India
 aksar aisa hota he ki jab tej gendbaajon ke khilaaf ran nahin banate to ran gati tej karne ke chakkar main ballebaaj spinner ke jhaanse main funs jate hai, aise main isse bachane kii chunauti bhi team ke saamne he
 There is no seat in Australia
 Whenever the Indian team has visited Australia, their path has not been easy
 yah paanchvaan mauka he jab border-gavaskar trophy khilne ke liye team india australia main he
 Prior to this, the dream of winning the series in four rounds has been a dream, India has won only 2 matches on Australian soil

 Initially, a little help will be for the fast bowlers but after this the pitch will become very favorable for batting

 15 agast ke maukey par laal kile main daakhil hone se pehle kai paabandiyaan hoti hai kai tarah kii suraksha jaanch se guzarana hota he
 What to take inside, what not to carry, this police tells through advertisements in newspapers and such guidelines are also in the invitation card
 purvi dilli ke rohan ne bhi yah sab padhaa or dekha tha
 He says he came to the Red Fort with his friend early in the morning as he was to watch the Independence Day program, but was stopped as soon as he passed through the security check outside the Red Fort as he was wearing a black shirt
 rohan ke mutabik, kaali shart pahanakar aane par pabandi he, aisa to na kahin suna he or na pataa he
 He was told not to go inside wearing a black hat and black shirt
 rohan ke mutabik, usne tay kar liya tha ki use kaarykram to dekhnaa he chaahe shart utarkar janaa pade
 According to Rohan, some women and girls were also hearing noises from security personnel
 isi bich ek ladki ne apana dupatta rohan ko de diya or phir rohan dupattey ko odhakar laal kile main daakhil ho paaya
 The comments rohan kii tarah yah pareshaani kai logon ko hui
 Last time also when i was at the Red Fort on the occasion of August 15, many people were disheartened, because they came wearing black clothes and the security personnel did not let them in
 maine is bare main kai surakshakarmiyon se baat kii
 No one speaks openly about the secret of black clothes, but most of the security personnel said that no one would enter and protest against the Prime Minister by waving his black shirt or hat in the air, so wearing black clothes or carrying black flag is prohibited
 kai pulicekarmi hansate hue kehete hai bhai sahab shubh kaam main to vaise bhi kaale kapade nahin pahanane chahie
 Rohan of East Delhi had also read and watched all this
 unka kahana he ki vah apane dost ke saath subah-subah laal kile par aa gaya kyonki use swatantraaa diwas kaa kaarykram dekhnaa tha, lekin jaise hi lalakile ke baahar lagi suraksha jaanch se guzara use roak liya gaya kyonki usne kaali shart pahani hui thi
 According to Rohan, wearing black shirt is prohibited, neither has heard of it nor know it
 use kaha gaya kaali topi or kaali shart pahanakar andar ja nahin ja sakate
 According to Rohan, he had decided that he had to watch the program even if he had to take off his shirt
 rohan ke mutabik, surakshakarmiyon se nokajhonk kii baaten kuch mahilaayein or ladkiyaan bhi sun rahi thim
 Meanwhile, a girl gave her scarf to Rohan and then was able to cover Rohan's scarf and enter the Red Fort
 tippaniyan Many people had this problem like Rohan
 pichhali baar bhi main jab 15 agast ke maukey par laal kile par tha to kai log maayoos ho gaye the, kyonki vah kaale kapade pahanakar aae the or surakshakarmiyon ne unhen andar nahin jane diya tha
 i talked to several security personnel about this
 kaale kapade ke rahasy par koi khulkar to nahin bolta lekin adhiktar surakshakarmiyon ne yah kaha ki koi andar ghuskar apni kaali shart yaa topi hawa main laharaakar pradhanmantri kaa virodh na karne lage isliye kaale kapade pahanakar yaa kaale jhande lekar aane par pabandi he
 Many policemen laugh and say that brother should not wear black clothes in good work anyway
 rohan ke mutabik, kaali shart pahanakar aane par pabandi he, aisa to na kahin suna he or na pataa he

 For the first time after independence, anti-india and Pakistan are going to military exercises
 yah sainya abhyaas is saal sitambar main rus main yojit hoga, jisamen bharat, pakistan or china ke saath shanghai sahyog sanghathan (SCO) ke sabhi desh hissaa lenge
 The SCO is a Chinese-dominated security group that is now seen as an nato-friendly organization
 is bahurashtriya (multi-nation) sainya abhyaas kaa makasad aatankwaad se nipatane ke liye kiya jayega
 Officials said that this multinational military exercise will be conducted under the framework of SCO
 unhone bataaya ki yah abhyaas rus ke uraal parvat kshetra par yojit kiya jayega or SCO ke kareeb sabhi sadsy iskaa hissaa banenge
 According to officials, the main objective of this exercise of peace mission is to increase cooperation among the eight member countries of SCO to combat terrorism
 unhone bataaya ki pichley hafte beijing main SCO sadsy deshon ke raksha mantriyon kii baithak main rakshaamantri nirmala sitaraman ne bharat ke is abhyaas main bhaag lene kii pushti kii
 He said that for the first time after independence, India and Pakistan would both be part of the same military exercise
 haalanki donon deshon kii senaaon ne sanyukt raashtra (UN) ke shanti raksha mishan main saath kaam kiya he
 The Presidents of Russia, China, Kyrgyz Republic, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan established the SCO at a summit in Shanghai in 2001
 bharat or pakistanko saal 2005 main is samooh ke paryvekshakon ke taur par shaamil kiya gaya tha
 Last year, both countries were made full members of this security group
 bharat ko sadsy banane ke liye rus or pakistan ko sadsy banane ke liye china ne majbootee se paksh rakhaa tha
 This military exercise comes at a time when there is a tense atmosphere between India and Pakistan
 seemaa paar se pakistan lagaataar sijafire kaa ulanghan kar rahaa he or aatanki ghuspaith kii koshishon ko anjaam de rahaa he
 At the same time, Pakistan is also being given a befitting reply from India
 haal hi main pakistan ne simavarti bhartiya graavon ko bhi nishaanaa banaaya tha, jisamen kai logon kii jaan chali gai thi or kai log jakhmi ho gaye the
 There is again tension on the Line of Control between India and Pakistan
 somvaar ko pakistan kii border ection team ne mendhar main mortar daage or shahid hue 2 bhartiya javaanon ke shav ke saath barbarta kii
 Pakistan's Border Action Team penetrated 250 meters into the Indian border and mutilated the bodies of the jawans
 iske baad indian army ko sarkaar kii ore se khuli chhot di gai or bhartiya sena ne karaara jawaab dete hue pakistan kii do seemaa chaukiyon ko dhwast kar diya or 7 pakistani sainikon ko dher kar diya
 Earlier there was a terrorist attack in Kulgam, this week there was a terrorist attack on the army base in Kupwara
 kashmir main paak-pryojit patharbaji kii ghatnaon main teji aati dikhi or aatankiyon ke nae video se kashmir main dehshat failaane kii koshish tej hoti dikhi
 Amid growing demand in India for revenge from Pakistan, the question here is that what is Pakistan wanting? After all, why is Pakistan still inciting India? 1
 navaj sarkaar mushkil mempakistan ke saath bharat ke rishton kii mushkil ye rahi he ki jab bhi vahaan kii sarkaar andruni mushkilon kaa saamana nahin kar paati to bharat ke saath border par tanaav badhaane main lag jaati he
 Right now the Nawaz government is in trouble in the Panama paper leak case
 vipakshi dal istife kaa dabaav bana rahe hai, court main sarkaar baikfoot par he
 In such a situation, it is clearly visible to divert attention from internal crisis and to increase the tension on the border of India
 2
 Crisis in front of the PAK Army on the Afghan border Seeing the failure of action against terrorist groups on the Afghanistan border, the efforts of the Pakistan Army have also gone towards increasing tension on the India border
 afgaan border par america ne bhi pakistani aatanki samoohon ke khilaaf sakhti dikhaai he
 In such a situation, the Pakistani military rulers are resorting to cowardly antics to increase the tension on the Indian border to avoid their disrespect
 mendhar main hui kyrana karrwai usee ilaake main pakistani sainya pramukh qamar javed bajva ke daure or bharat ke khilaaf jehar ugalane ke ek din baad hui he
 3
 baluchistan-gilgit-pok main aazaadee kii aawaaj tejahaal ke dinon main pakistan ke andar baluchistan-gilgit or pok main aazaadee kii aawaaj tej hui he
 In gilgit-baltistan, local leaders have even started saying that if a referendum is held, they will join with India
 paak-adhikrut kashmir main bhi pakistan ke khilaaf sur buland hue hai
 Pakistan has come down on repression to suppress the demand for independence in Balochistan
 bharat ne baluchistan main aazaadee kii maang ko khule samarthan kaa elaan bhi kiya he aise main pakistan kashmir border par tanaav badhaakar bharat ko uljhaana chahta he
 4
 china kii shalmerica kheme se nikalakar china ke saath gathjod banane kii koshish main lage pakistan ko china kii shah bhi bharat ke saath badhati talkhi kaa ek kaaran ho saktaa he
 China is building an economic corridor through Pakistan at a huge cost of $ 46 billion
 jiske khilaaf bharat ne aawaaj buland kiya he
 Local people in many parts of Pakistan are also calling this project of China an imperialist step
 pakistani aatankiyon ke khilaaf bain lagavane kii bharat kii koshishon ko yuan main china roktaa rahaa he
 It may be that Pakistan wants to confuse China with India by raising a tussle with India at the instigation of China in Arunachal and Ladakh on the back of a befitting reply from India and an escalation of the border issue
 5
 Pakistan has been constantly trying to internationalize the Kashmir issue
 is baar kashmir main patharbaji ko badhaava dekar phir pakistan ne ise aage badhaayaa he
 At the same time, by increasing tension on the border, Pakistan wants to hoist it on the international stage
 do din pehle hi pakistani sena pramukh ne elosi kaa daura kiya or kaha ki kashmiriyon ke sangharsh main pakistan apni madad jari rakhega
 Obviously, Pakistan's conspiracy along the Line of Control is to spark the Kashmir issue

 The father lovingly named his goddess Shakti as Gauri
 sard mausam main apane usee pita kii phikr main vah jacket dryklinar ko dene ghar se nikali thi, lekin kya pataa tha der shaam usee pita ko apni beti kilash tukdon main milegi
 The body that Somva found in pieces on the Shaheed Path of Lucknow was of Gauri Srivastava, a first-semester student at Ambedkar Law College
 mangalvaar subah gauri ke pita shishir shrivastav ne pijiai thana pahunchakar photo or kapadon se apni beti kii shinaakht kii
 Shirir, an interior decorator, told that Gauri had left home at around 1 pm on Sunday to give his jacket to the dry cleaner
 duusari ore, laash kii shinaakht hone ke saath hi kai tukdon main banty gauri kii laash or hatya kaa rahasy ulajh gaya he
 The police suspect that a close one has brutally murdered Gauri
 postmortem main saamne aayaa he ki chaatra kii badi berahami se hatya kii gai or use kisi dhardaar mashin se kaata gaya
 Within one and a half hours of the murder, the corpse was set up
 haalanki postmortem main dushkarm kii pushti nahin hui he
 Police have detained five youths, including Gauri's Facebook friend, for questioning
 postmortem main shaamil doctoron kaa kahana he ki gauri ke hatyaron ne krurta kii simaaen tod daali thim
 He struggled to escape, but Gauri's brain was damaged due to internal injuries
 doctoron kaa maananaa he vah coma main chali gai hogi, jiske baad jatke se uske gardan par dhardaar hathiyaar se hamalaa kiya gaya
 Doctors said that according to which the parts of Gauri were cut, it is clear that some machine was used in it
 uski jaan nikalne se pehle hi uskaa baayan haath bhi kaata ja chukaa tha
 The lack of sharp cutting until the neck and left arm are cut indicates this, while the other parts of the body were cut after death because the cuts of these organs are extremely sharp
 anumaan he ki gauri kii hatya ravivaar shaam saat se aath baje ke bich kii gai

 But the BJP government or the Speaker did not suspend him, so why was the Congress MLA suspended? unhone is baat par jor dete hue kaha ki court ne unhen ucch nyaayalay main jane kaa bhi vakt diya he baavjood iske bhaajapa satta kaa galat istamaal kar rahi he
 In this case, threatening the movement against the Bharatiya Janata Party government, Dhanani said that the Congress will organize agitations and demonstrations across the state on Wednesday
 congress ke sabhi kaaryakarta iskaa virodh kar tamaam jila colector ko aavedan denge
 So at the same time Gujarat BJP President Jitu Wadhani hit back at the Congress and said that this decision has been taken following the rules of the Supreme Court
 unhone kaha ki congress is bare main kuch bhi bolne se pehle supreme court ke aadesh ko padhanaa chaahe
 It has been clearly stated in the Supreme Court that if the punishment is more than 2 years, then the MLA can be suspended
 gauratlab he ki congress ne 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav main 182 main se 77 seat jiti thi lekin ab unke paas 74 seat hi bachi he
 First of all, Congress MLA from Jasdan seat Kunwarji Bavaliya left the Congress and took hold of BJP, after which he was made a minister in the cabinet
 or na to vahiin ek maheene pehle oonja kii vidhayak dow aashaben patel ne party ke netaaon se naaraaz hokar vidhayak pad se istipha de diya tha or congress kaa saath chhod kar bijepi main shaamil ho gai thi
 At the same time, another Congress MLA has been suspended citing the Constitution

 Yuvraj said, "if India has to do well then Veeru (virender Sehwag), Sachin (tendulkar), Rahul (dravid), (VVS) Laxman will all have to do well together
 acchhee saajhedaari banani hogi or mujhe puraa bharosa he ki ve agle test match main vaapasi karenge
 The aggressive batsman away from cricket due to a tumor in the lung, credited Australia for a great performance in the first two Tests of the four-match series
 unhone vishesh taur par purv captain riki ponting or maaikel hasi kii tarif kii jo sidney main farm main laute or aalochakon ko shant kiya
 Yuvraj said, 'you have to give credit to Australia, they played very good cricket
 sabhi hasi or ponting ko chukaa hua maan rahe the, in khilaadiyon ne vaapasi kii or ran banaae or maaikel clark ke saath milakar antar paidaa kiya
 ' yuvaraj ne bharat ke vaapasi karne kii ummid jataai or saath hi austrailian media kii in report ko bhi bakawaas qaraar diya ki team main matbhed hai

 i only hope that the Test match is good for him and all rumors are cleared
 mujhe puraa bharosa he ki ve sab milakar kuch vishesh karenge
 Comparing the current series and the series in Australia led by Anil Kumble in 2008, Yuvraj said that the team showed a resurgence after the 'monkeygate' episode in Sydney four years ago
 tippaniyan The 30-year-old last played in November against the West Indies, after which he was revealed to have a tumor
 yuvaraj ne kaha ki vah test cricket khilne ke liye betaab tha lekin bigadate hue swasthya ke saath khelnaa galati tha
 Yuvraj, who played the first two Tests for India with a lung infection, said, 'I was always desperate to play Test cricket but at that time i was not 100 percent fit
 jab mujhe pataa chalaa ki meraa tumor ghaatak nahin he to maine shat pratishat feet hone ke baad cricket khilne kaa faisla kiya
 Yuvraj said that he is now working hard to regain full fitness and make a comeback to international cricket with the upcoming tri-series in Australia
 yuvaraj ne kaha, ‘agar bharat ko acha pradarshan karnaa he to viru (virendra sahvaag), sachin (tendulkar), rahul (dravid), (vivies) lakshmana sabhi ko ek saath acha pradarshan karnaa hoga
 a good partnership will have to be formed and i am confident that he will be back in the next Test match
 ’ fefde main tumor ke kaaran cricket se dur is aakraamak ballebaaj ne chaar maichon kii shrinkhalaa ke pehle do test main shandaar pradarshan ke liye australia ko shrey diya
 He particularly praised former captains Ricky Ponting and Michael Hussey who returned to form in Sydney and pacified the critics
 yuvaraj ne kaha, ‘aapako australia ko shrey dena hoga, unhone kaaphi acha cricket khelaa
 All were considering Hussey and Ponting as repaid, these players made a comeback and scored and made a difference with Michael Clarke
 ’ Yuvraj hoped to make a comeback for India and also called the Australian media's report rubbish that there were differences in the team
 unhone kaha, ‘jab team haar rahi ho to aalochana hoti hi he
 i do not agree that there are differences in the team, these issues have been raised by the media
 main sirf itani ummid karata hum ki unke liye test match acha rahe or sari afvaahen mit jaaen
 i am confident that they will all do something special together
 ’ maujuuda shrinkhalaa or 2008 main anil kumble kii aguai main austrailia main hui shrinkhalaa kii tulana karte hue yuvaraj ne kaha ki chaar saal pehle sidney main ‘mankigate’ prakaran ke baad team ne vaapasi karte hue jajba dikhaaya tha
 The comments yah 30 varshiya antim baar november main westeindies ke khilaaf november main khelaa tha jiske baad use tumor hone kaa khulaasa hua
 Yuvraj said he was desperate to play Test cricket but playing with deteriorating health was a mistake
 fefdon main sankraman ke saath bharat kii ore se pehle do test khilne vaale yuvaraj ne kaha, ‘main hameshaa se test cricket main khilne ko betaab tha lekin us samay main shat pratishat feet nahin tha
 When i came to know that my tumor is not malignant, i decided to play cricket after getting 100% fit
 ’ yuvaraj ne kaha ki ab vah purna fitness hasil karne or australia main aagaamee trikoniya shrinkhalaa ke saath antarrashtriya cricket main vaapasi karne ke liye kadi mehnat kar rahe hai
 Yuvraj said, 'you have to give credit to Australia, they played very good cricket

 supreme court ne bhima koregaanv hinsa maamle main chargeshit daakhil karne kii avadhi 90 din badhaane yaa na badhaane ke maamle kii sunwaayee puri kar lee he
 The Bombay High Court turned down the appeal of the Maharashtra government for filing the chargesheet
 iske khilaaf maharashtra sarkaar ne supreme court main apil kii he
 The Supreme Court on Thursday completed the hearing of the case
 ab court isapar faisla baad main sunayega
 The bench headed by Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi, after hearing the arguments of all the concerned parties, said that a decision on this would be given later
 sheersh adaalat ne ucch nyaayalay ke is aadesh par roak laga di thi
 The state police has filed a charge sheet in this case
 pune police ne vakil surendra gadling, nagpur vishvavidhyalay main professor shoma sen, dalit kaaryakarta sudhir dhawale, kaaryakarta mahesh raut or kerala ke ronaa wilson ko pichley saal june main maovadiyon se sambandh rakhane ke aarope main gaiyrkanoonee gatividhiyaan (rokthaam) kanoon ke tahat giraftaar kiya tha
 Like Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh in Madhya Pradesh, the anti-incumbency trend is reflected in the almost static picture of the assembly election results 2018
 rajya ke 230 sadasyon ke sadan ke liye congress or bhartiya janata party kaa sau-sau se zyada siton par aage chalane ke peeche congressiyon kii ekajutata or bhaajapaayiyon ke damege control ko vajah mana ja saktaa he
 From the haze of election campaign to the round of counting, the contest between the two parties was seen, and the credit goes to the leaders who actually worked for the Congress forgetting the differences
 shivaraj sarkaar ke khilaaf satta virdohi lahar kareeb do saalon se zyada mahasoos kii ja rahi thi
 However, it started only after the Vyapam scam surfaced
 iske baad kisaanon kii samasyaayein or badhati berogari ne bhi asantosh gaharaa diya
 When the issue of SC-ST Act also came up, Shivraj faced the anger of "mai Ke Lalas" when he made a statement of his favor but it did not show any effect on the election results as the number of votes polled by the SPX can be said to be negligible
 
 madhyapradesh kii janata ne badlaav ke liye vot kiya, thik usee tarah jaise dilli main shila dikshit ko acha kaam karne ke baavjood janata ne satta se baahar kar diya
 Issues like demonetisation and GST also went against the BJP
 notebandi ke paksh main bhaajapa aaj tak thos daleel pesh nahin kar pai or jiesti kii visangatiyaan iske lagu hone ke saal bhar baad bhi dur nahin ho sakin
 If GST increased the difficulty of traders, the Congress made the wind in its favor by promising loan waiver to the farmers who were not getting adequate rate of yield and debt
 ant tak bhaajapa ne kisaan karjamaafee kii ghoshnaa nahin kii jabaki vah aisa kar nuksaan ko kam kar sakati thi
 In contrast, the Congress continued to make sharp attacks against Modi and Shivraj
 kisaan, berogari, bhrashtachar ke mudde par congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne lagaataar bhaajapa ko gherkar baichaiyn rakhaa or baaki kaa kaam badlaav kaa mood banaakar baithe matadaata ne kar diya
 The truth of unemployment is that there was a flood of educational institutions in the state, but according to them jobs did not come in the state
 tarif shivaraj kii bhi kerani padegi jinhone congress ko ekatarfa jeet kaa mauka nahin diya or mukaable ko kaante kii takkar main tabdeel kar diya
 The end of this match is yet to be seen

' a post shared by Akshay Kumar (@akshaykumar) on Apr 23, 2019 at 7:52am pdtlokasaba chunaav 2019 kii vyasttaaon ke bich pradhanmantri narendra modi ne abhinayta akshay kumaar (akshay Kumar) ko pehla gairraajnneetik intervyuu diya
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who frequently interviewed anchors of TV channels during the Lok Sabha elections, has given a non-political interview for the first time and that too to actor Akshay Kumar
 pradhanmantri narendra modi (PM Narendra Modi) ne akshay kumaar ke saath khaas baatcheet main apane jivan se jude sabhi anubhavon ko saajha kiya or apni nijee jindagi se jude kai sawaalon kaa jawaab diya
 Recently, the pair of Ranveer and Deepika Padukone is the most talked about film industry
 donon kalakaaron kii shaadi kii charchaaen bhi joro par hai
 Apart from this, both the actors are seen escaping in front of the media about their marriage
 ranvir ne haalia intervyuu main shaadi se judi afvaahon par khulkar baat kii
 Ranveer confessed to his relationship with Deepika for the first time in an interview given to Idea Today
 ranvir ne publikali kaha ki wo or deepika kapal hai
 Even on the matter of marriage, he said that these too are included in his plan
 haalaakin ranvir ne puri tarah se kuch bhi kehane se bachane kii koshish kii or sahi vakt kaa takaza diya
 deepika-ranbir was spoiled, the fashion show was canceled! Ranveer said that rumor is just a rumor and to say something officially means to call it official
 tarikhon ko lekar unhone kaha ki bhavishya main ye kab hoga ise lekar wo shyor nahin hai
 Further, Ranveer said that at the moment both people are very busy with work
 isse alag deepika ke bare main unhone kaha ki wo abhi apni back problem se pareshaan hai or dhire-dhire isse ubarne kii koshish kar rahi hai
 ranveer-deepika's wedding 'tay', can be enjoyed this month
 Let us tell you that the love between the two actors flourished during the 2013 film 'goliyon Ki Rasleela - Ramleela'
 deepika ne ek puraane intervyuu main kaha bhi tha ki jab wo or ranvir saath-saath hote hai to unhen kisi or kii jarurat mahasoos nahin hoti
 Mamata Banerjee on Saturday called all opposition parties on a platform against the Modi government before the Lok Sabha elections 2019
 is manch par bijepi party ke netaa or saansad shatrughna sinha bhi najar aae
 BJP leader Shatrughan Sinha from the forum fired questions from his own government and asked PM Modi that as long as you keep running away from the questions, all of us will have to believe that 'chowkidar is a thief'
 shatrughna sinha ne mamata kii raily main kaha ki desh badlaav chahta he
 People tell me that i speak against the BJP, but if there is a rebellion to tell the truth, then i am also a rebel
 ho saktaa he ki is raily ke baad main bhaajapa main nahin rahun
 BJP leader Shatrughan Sinha said that till this moment i am still in BJP
 abhi yashavanth sinha kah rahe the ki is raily ke baad main party se jarur nikaal diya jaaoongaa
 Even if i am in BJP, i belong to the people of India first
 meri javabdehi or jimmedaari bharat ke janata ke prati he
 Everything i do and say is in the national interest and public interest
 unhone kaha ki deshhit se bada kuch nahin hota
 i show the party a mirror
 bataata hum ki yah loktantr he, zyada jyadatiyaan mat karo
 Shatrughan Sinha said what difference can be found between Atal Bihari Vajpayee's time and Modi's time
 main kahata hum ki atal ji ke jamaane main lokshahi thi, is jamaane main taanaashaahee he
 It will not do
 yah jyadadati he desh ke logon ke saath
 Suddenly the Tughlaqi decree was issued overnight
 aapane notebandi kii ghoshnaa kar di
 Why did you announce demonetisation
 kya kabhi sochaa ki isse kabhi rehadi, patari vaale, kisaanon, mazdooron, yuvaaon par kya asar padegaa
 You did it without consulting anyone
 main yakeenan kahata hum ki yah party kaa faisla nahin tha
 If this decision was made by the party, then Advani ji, Joshi ji, Yashwant Sinha, Shourie ji and i would also know
 magar yah faisla sidhe piemo se hua
 Attacking the Modi government over the demonetisation decision, Shatrughan Sinha said that people had to face shame to withdraw their own money
 vyapaar barbaad ho gaya
 The women of the house, the mothers and sisters, who had been pressing money with good intention for the people of the house, all of them suddenly became airborne
 aakhir notebandi kaa adhikaar kisne diya
 Still could not recover from demonetisation issued the decree of GST
 congress ke adhyaksh jo kaabil hai, jinhen ek saal main teen rajyon main congress ko jeet dilaai, unhone jiesti ko gabbar singh tex naam diya
 So far 368 amendments have been made in GST
 khud jab modi ji mukhyamantri the, tab unhone ghor virodh kiya tha
 Declared GST as if it had got second independence
 unhone kaha ki issepujari tabah hone lage
 GST was imposed on the langar in the gurudwara
 yani ek taraf notebandi, jiesti yani ise kehete hai neem par karela
 Everyone has spoken on the way farmers are suffering till date
 sabase badi or buree baat he ki rafel
 i am not even saying that you are guilty, but also i will not say that you are not guilty
 aap agar kuch nahin bolenge or chhupaayenge to desh kii janata kahegi ki vaaki desh kaa 'chaukeedaar chor' he
 He said that in Bihar it is called thaathai
 agar aap modi ji jab tak is par rafel par thethrai karenge, tab tak aap sunate rahenge chaukeedaar chor he
 He said that HAL made airplanes like Sukhoi
 HAL jo hindustan kii apni company he, use yah contract nahin diya gaya, magar jo das din pehle company ai or usne ek cycle tak nahin banaai, use aapane yah contract kyon de diya
 Modi ji should answer on Rafael, otherwise, till 'thethai' will do, you will hear that 'chowkidar is the thief' of the country
 madhumakhiyon kii rani kaa bhojan 'royal jelly' (shahi jelly) insaanon ke kai rogon ko thik karne or sharir ko ek nayaa jivan dene kii kshamta rakhata he
 Executive Member of National Beekeeping Board Devvrat Sharma said, 'royal Jelly' has the ability to cure many incurable diseases
 asthma, cancer, gathiya, madhumeh, thyroid jaise rogon main iske seven se rogi ko baari laabh miltaa he
 In addition to curing paralysis caused by spinal cord erosion, it improves the nervous system and helps to relieve arthritis by restoring fluidity in the knees

 Devvrat Sharma said that researches are being done in Pune's Bharatiya Vidya Peeth to treat many serious diseases of bee propolis, honeycomb, sting and royal jelly
 is santhaan ne ab tak deshi str par taiyaar lagbhag 1200 dawaaon kaa patent bhi karaayaa he
 Apart from this, bee products are also being used in many cancer research institutes
 unhone kaha ki sambhavat: hamaare purvajon ko madhumakhiyon ke tamaam utpaadon ke upyog kii bharpoor jaankaree thi or kai asaadhya rogon main iskaa istemaal kar ve behad lambii umr praapt karte the
 Sharma said that today people in the country are only aware of honey from beekeeping but are not aware of the use of all its products and the methods used and the structure required to obtain them were not available
 unhone kaha ki unhone madhumakhipaalan kshetra ke liye prasiddh tamaam deshon kii yatra apane kharch par kii or unke tamaam upkarnon ke bare main na sirf jaankaree lee balki desh lautakar dank, polan (paragakan), royal jelly, propolis (momi gond) nikaalane ke upkarnon ko bhartiya tareeke se banaaya or unhen nikaalane kii jaankaree kisaanon ko di or unhen prashikshan diya

 (is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he
 It is published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) He said that probably our ancestors were well aware of the use of all the products of bees and they used to get very long lifespan by using it in many incurable diseases
 sharma ne kaha ki aaj desh main logon ko keval madhumakhipaalan se shahad prapti kii jaankaree he lekin iske tamaam utpaadon ke upyog ke bare jaankaree nahin he or unke upyog main laane ke tareeke or inhen praapt karne kii jarari sanrachana uplabdh nahin thim
 He said that he traveled to all the countries famous for the beekeeping sector at his own expense and not only inquired about their equipment but also returned to the country to collect stings, pollen (pollen), royal jelly, propolis (waxy glue) extracting equipment
 Made the Indian way and gave information to the farmers to extract them and trained them
 tippaniyan Giving information about Royal Jelly, Sharma said that there are two major honey-producing cradles in the country

 The story of the india-pakistan match in the World Cup is different
 pulavama main hue hamale ke baad is match ke bahishkaar kii maang bhi uthi thi
 But it is a relief that this match is going on next week
 saare tikat bik chuke hai
 In the history of the World Cup, the Indian team has won all 6 matches played with Pakistan so far
 donon timen vishwa cap main safar kii shuruyaat kar chuki hai
 Sports journalist Shivendra Kumar Singh spoke to former Pakistan veteran Zaheer Abbas called Asian Bradman on the possibility of both
 uske kuch ansh:aap bhi romanchit hai vishwacap main bharat pakistan ke bich mukaable ko lekar?ji bilkul, sabase zyada demand isi match kii hoti he
 People are willing to take tickets for thousands of pounds
 kabhi ashes siries par cricket premiyon kii najar rahati thi lekin ab uskaa bhi craij kam ho gaya he
 While the india-pakistan match is still a 'crowded puller', the organizers also earn a substantial amount
 aap donon tiimon ko kareeb se 'follow' karte hai
 How are you expecting the match? See, no one can deny that India is a great team right now
 uski fielding or bowling bhi kaaphi acchhee ho chuki he
 The batting is very good
 lihaaja ye teenon adwantage team india ke saath he
 Even for Pakistan's team, i can say that no one could even think, this team will win the Champions Trophy
 par unhone wo karnama kar dikhaaya
 In this World Cup too, he recorded a convincing win against England
 england na sirf vishwa cap kii tagdi daavedaar he balki duniya kii number ek team he
 Actually, the point is that whatever is played well on match day is the result
 kisi jamaane main pakistan kii team aksar bhartiya team ko haraa diya karti thi
 Pakistan's team used to be very good
 ab ye din aa gaye hai ki india kii team bahut shandaar ho gai he
 He has 'improved' his performance
 to ye daur aata-jaataa rahata he
 Which players of Pakistan do you expect more against India? Especially you mentioned the match against England
 us match main to pakistan kii ballebaaji shandaar rahi
 Overall, do you think the Pakistan team has the ability to beat India? As i said earlier, no one expected that the Pakistan team would win the Champions Trophy
 par aisa hua
 You can't say anything babar ajam or fakhar jamaa ne england ke khilaaf acha pradarshan kiya
 i am not comparing these players to other batsmen of the world, but Pakistan has high hopes from them
 teenon top order ballebaajon ke paas bahut zyada anubhav nahin he lekin teenon achche ballebaaj hai
 Their maturity will also be tested in the World Cup
 yah sawaal aapse aksar poocha jaataa hoga ki vishwa cap ke itihaas main bharat ke khilaaf pakistan ko hameshaa haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa he
 This time also the Indian team will get any psychological benefit of this thing? i do not agree
 pakistani khiladinnon main yah feeling jarur hogi ki ham log vishwa cap main bharat se kabhi jite nahin
 But at the same time there will be a desire that this 'jinks' be broken
 agar puure vishwa cap kii baat karen to shuruaati maichon main jis tarah kii pichen aap dekh rahe hai, kya yah ballebaajon kii ladaai lag rahi he?bilkul sahi kaha aapane
 Fans visiting the stadium enjoyed it, so batting wickets have been prepared
 vishwa cap ke pehle pakistan or england ke bich jo vanade siries kheli gai, usamen bhi lagaataar bade score bane
 There is absolutely no grass on the wicket
 safed gend kii seem ko bhi patala kar diya gaya he
 This makes it less seam and swing than before
 adarsh sthiti main yah galat he kyonki gendbaaj bilkul bebas najar aate hai lekin phens ke lihaaj se yah acha he
 The format in this World Cup is also different
 top 4 tiimon ko semifinal khelnaa he
 What are the chances of Asian teams? India and Pakistan teams will do well in Asian teams
 pakistan kii shuruyaat acchhee nahin rahi he lekin england ko haraakar unhone apana dam-kham dikhaa diya
 She can also play the final against India
 asian tiimon ke alaava australia or england kii timen bhi top 4 main rahengi
 The New Zealand team will also be watched
 *** The Yogi government of Uttar Pradesh will consider the formation of a 'uttar Pradesh Muslim Waqf Board' by merging the Sunni and Shia Waqf Boards surrounded by allegations of corruption
 iske liye shashan se prastaav maanga gaya he
 State Minister of State for Wakf Mohsin Raza said that through letters to his department, there have been many suggestions that the Shia and Sunni Waqf Boards should be merged together, it would be lawful to do so
 nahin chahta vilay ho- ajmavahin sapa netaa ajam khan kaa kahana he ki bijepi kaa level dhire-dhire neeche ho rahaa he, sarkaar ko yah pataa nahin he ki is tarah kaa kanoon 8-10 saal pehle hi aayaa tha, lekin upi main ise lagu nahin kiya gaya tha
 Because there are small boards here
 aaj bhi main nahin chahta ki in donon bordon kaa vilay ho
 Uttar Pradesh mein maine ise laagu nahi kiya tha
 Mai aaj bhi nahi chahta ki dono ka vilaay ho: Azam Khan on shia,sunni Waqf boards— ANI UP (@aninewsup)october 22, 2017kya bole the mohsin rajamohsin raja ne kaha “uttar pradesh or bihar ko chhodkar baaki 28 rajyon main ek-ek vakf board he
 The Waqf Act-1995 also states that it is mandatory to have at least 15 percent share of any section in the total Waqf units to form separate Shia and Sunni Waqf Boards
 yani agar vakf kii kul 100 ikaiyaan hai to unamem shiya vakf kii kam se kam 15 ikaiyaan honi chaiye
 Uttar Pradesh is not meeting this rule right now
 ”raja bole ki is samay sunni vakf board ke paas ek lakh 24 hajaar vakf ikaiyaan hai jabaki shiya vakf board ke paas paanch hajaar se zyada ikaiyaan nahi hai, jo mahaj chaar pratishat hi he
 By law, it is already going wrong
 raja ne kaha ki sunni or shiya muslim vakf board ke vilay ke suzav ko gambheertha se lete hue sarkaar ne is bare main shashan se prastaav maanga he
 If the proposal comes after the law department's test, then it will be considered and made 'uttar Pradesh Muslim Waqf Board'
 unhone bataaya ki sanyukt board banane kii sthiti main usamen vakf sampattiyon ke pratishat ke hisaab se shiya or sunni sadsy namit kar diye jaaenge
 The Chairman will be made one of them
 is bich, shiya vakf board ke adhyaksh wasim rizvi ne raja ke is bayaan par pratikriya main kaha ki philhal to shiya or sunni vakf bordon kaa gathan april 2015 main ho chukaa he
 His term will be five years
 vakf kanoon main aisa koi praavdhaan nahin he ki chalate hue board ko bhang kar diya jaae
 When the board time runs out, the government should check how many Waqf's are there and what is their income
 unhone bataaya ki vakf act main yah bhi kaha gaya he ki vakf kii kul aamadani main kisi ek vakf board kaa yogadan kam se kam 15 pratishat hona chaiye
 If the Hussainabad Trust's income is included, the Shia Waqf Board's share in the total income will be more than 15 percent
 philhal yah maamla adaalat main lambit he
 Farooqui welcomed Sunni Central Waqf Board President Zufar Farooqui said that if the government wants to merge Shia and Sunni Waqf Boards, they welcome it
 haalanki unhone yah bhi kaha ki varsh 1999 main tatkaaleen kalyaan singh sarkaar ne in donon board kii alag alag sthapana kii thi
 In such a situation, the question is whether the decision of the then government of this party was not right in the eyes of the present BJP government
 raja ne kaha ki kendriya vakf parishad ke mutabik, uttar pradesh shiya vakf board ke paas maatr teen hajaar vakf ikaiyaan hai
 There is no point in having a separate Shia Waqf Board even if we consider it as five thousand
 alag-alag adhyaksh, mukhya adhishasi adhikari or anya staff rakhane se phijulkharchi hi hoti he
 This increases the burden on the government
 maaloom ho ki kendriya vakf parishad ne uttar pradesh ke shiya tathaa sunni vakf board main aniyamittaaon kii shikaayat par jaanch karaayi thi
 In the investigation report in March last, all the complaints were found correct
 vakf rajyamantri raja ne shiya or sunni board ko lekar alag-alag taiyaar kii gayi report mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ko saunpi thi
 According to Raza, the Shia and Sunni Waqf Boards of Uttar Pradesh surrounded by allegations of corruption will be dissolved soon
 mukhyamantri yogi adityanath kii manjuuri milane ke baad isaki prakriya shuru kar di gai he
 Let us tell you that the controversy arose in November 2017, when Rahul Gandhi was signed in the column of "non-hindus" in the register of visitors in a temple

 But the question still remains as to whose treasure this is

 professor laal amrendra singh kii maane to ye khajaana 16veen shatabdi main yahaan raaj karne vaale maharaj trilokchand ne jutaya tha
 The Mahakhajane may also have been hidden in the fort walls

 On Diwali, you and we enjoy the festival with our family
 lekin kya aapane kabhi sochaa he ki aap hi ke aasapaas kai aise log bhi hai jo tyohaar manaa hi nahin pate
 The reason is not the lack of money nor any matter related to religion
 dilli main rahane vaale attar singh ne pichley 25 varshon main sirf ek baar apane parivaar ke saath diwali manaai he
 The reason? He is involved in the fire brigade here and due to this he does not get a holiday on Diwali

 In this long period i have celebrated Diwali with my family only once
 'keval attar singh hi aise shaks nahin hai jo diwali nahin manaa pate

 After the uproar over 'maggi' in the past, the recently launched 'patanjali Atta Noodles' by yoga guru Ramdev is in controversy
 bhartiya khaadya suraksha evam maanak praadhikaran (FSSAI) kaa kahana he ki yoga guru kii company ne noodles launch karne se pehle jaruri manjuuri nahin lee he
 SK Tijerwala, spokesperson for Patanjali's Safai Baba Ramdev, said that Pantjali has not violated FSSAI rules in the case of flour noodles
 unhone press relies jari karke kaha ki hamen FSSAI se central category main pasta kaa license mila hua he or FSSAI kii paribhaasha ke mutabik, noodles pasta ke antargat aata he
 Interestingly, while the FSSAI officer has said that approval has not been given, the license number given by FSSAI has been printed on the packet of 'patanjali Atta Noodles'
 angreji akhbaar 'indian express' ko FSSAI ke cheirperson ashish bahuguna ne bataaya, 'patanjali aataa noodlesko hamaari ore se koi apruval nahin mila he
 i got information about this and we are working against it
 ' bahuguna FSSAI ke atirikt mukhya kaaryakari adhikari kaa bhi padbhaar sambhaal rahe hai
 Significantly, just after the ban on 'maggi' noodles, yoga guru Ramdev announced to knock in the noodles market
 beete somvaar ko hi unki company patanjali ne 'aataa noodles' ko bazaar main launch kiya he, jiske packet par FSSAI kii ore se license number 10014012000266 chapa he
 Bahuguna says, "how can a product that has not been approved get a license number?" The state government gives manufacturing license for any product, but the required approval is given by FSSAI
 lekin jab patanjali aataa noodles ko apruv hi nahin kiya gaya to license number kaise mil gaya
 i do not know how to get the license
 'kya kahana he patanjali ayurveda kadusri ore, yoga guru ramdev ke pravaktaa esake tijaarwaala is puure vivaad par kehete hai, 'FSSAI kii ore se isi saal agast main jari niyamon ke anusaar noodles ko launch karne ke liye alag se license lene par koi roak nahin he
 When we have the complete papers, we will reply further
 'FSSAI ke sutron kii maane to ramdev kii company patanjali ayurveda limited ek emmemasiji venture he or isane abhi tak noodles ke apruval ke liye koi aavedan nahin kiya he
 An FSSAI official says, 'we don't know what's in the noodles?' According to information from the FSSAI Food Licensing and Registration System, noodles are included in the food park and herbal park of Patanjali Ayurved Limited, which are allowed to be manufactured

 Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, taking cognizance of the news coming on TV about the displeasure of passengers at the Sheremetyevo and Domodedovo airports, ordered the General Prosecutor to inspect
 roosi tivi channel ke mutabik moscow uddyan centre or isse sambandhit anya sthanon par chalaae ja rahe abhiyaanon ke nirikshan ke kremlin ke aadesh ke baad yaatyaat abhiyojak sthiti kaa jayja lene hawaii addon par pahunche
 On the other hand, the Moscow Meteorological Department has warned of an icy storm
 isse adhikariyon or yatriyon kii pareshaaniyaan badhane kii ashanka he
 According to Igor Neradko, the head of Russia's Federal Air Traffic Agency, flights are expected to be normal in the next two days at Domodedovo Airport
 domodedovo pravaktaa elena gaalanova ne roosi tivi channel ko bataaya ki hawaii adde par paristhitiyon main dhire dhire sudhaar ho rahaa he
 The Supreme Court has reserved order on whether the bail of suspended RJD MLA Rajaballabh Yadav will be canceled
 buudhvaar ko sunwaayee par court ne kaha ki wo ek yaa do din main faisla sunayegi
 It is clear from the court's order that Rajaballabh Yadav will remain in jail for the time being
 supreme court ne kaha, ye maamla naaballig ke saath rape or pokso act se judaa he
 We also have to see that there is a fair trial in this case
 yadav kii ore se kaha gaya ki jab tak trial puraa nahin hota wo bihar se baahar rahane ko taiyaar hai, jamaanat radd na kii jaae
 The Bihar government should not have accused the Chief Justice of the High Court as such
 aise to sab log jajon par aarope lagaate hue supreme court aa jaaenge
 Yadav's lawyer said that all the arguments of the state government are baseless
 aaropee MLA he to isliye rajya sarkaar is tarah ke aarope nahin laga sakati
 All the allegations of rape are false and there are many lies in this charge
 vahiin, bihar sarkaar kii ore se kaha gaya ki yadav kii jamaanat radd kii jaani chahie
 Three weeks ago the High Court judge refused to grant bail, but after that the Chief Justice granted bail
 tippaniyan Even after the Supreme Court sent Yadav to jail, the statements of the victim were recorded in the court, but the statements of many important witnesses are yet to be recorded
 yadav is cese ke trial or gavaahon ko prabhavit kar saktaa he
 Even in prison, he laid down all the rules
 bataa den ki RJD ke nilambit vidhayak rajballabh yadav ko patna hoicourt se mili jamaanat radd karne kii bihar sarkaar kii yachika par supreme court sunwaayee kar rahaa he
