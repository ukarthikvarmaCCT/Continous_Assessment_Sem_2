 In fact, the body of a girl was found on the night of 17 April near the Gymkhana Club of Meerut
 use fouran aspataal le jaaya gaya, lekin tab tak der ho chuki thi
 As there was no other clue surrounding the corpse, the police decided to first identify the girl to reach the murderer

 Meanwhile, some people uploaded a post on Facebook with a picture of the girl's corpse and appealed for her identity
 apni beti kii talash main jute is ladki ke gharavaalon ko bhi fasebuk se hi is manahuus khabar kaa pataa chalaa
 He immediately reached Meerut from Ghaziabad, where his daughter, who had come out of the house two days before, had fallen prey to the murderer, saying that she was going to meet her friend
 ye ladki thi gajiabad kii neha verma
 Neha was married and had two children, but due to differences with her husband, she lived alone with her mother
 is post ke jariye police neha ke gharavaalon tak kya pahunchi, neha kaa puraa trek record saamne aa gaya
 During the investigation, it was revealed that Neha was married to a man named Vipin Verma two years ago, but Neha also had a close relationship with a young man named Wasim Elahi, who lives in Meerut
 ye baat neha ke pati ko nagavar gujri
 Vipin applied for divorce from Neha and separated from both the children with her
 idhar, neha or wasim kaa milanaa-julna or bhi zyada ho gaya

 udhar, police ke chaanbin shuru karte hi wasim or shoeb to faraar ho gaye, lekin asif pakadaa gaya
 Nehaassif had started to flirt with someone else, the story he told during interrogation was very strange
 police ko pataa chalaa ki apane pati se alag ho kar wasim ke ishk kar rahi neha in dinon kisi or ladke ke bhi kareeb aa chuki thi, jabaki wasim usase shaadi karnaa chahta tha
 In such a situation, Neha's attitude was so irksome that she conspired to kill Neha

 Since Sidhu was about to go out, Archana was called for a shoot for two episodes

 Please tell that Navjot Singh Sidhu had said after the Pulwama attack that there is no religion of terror
 iske liye puure desh ko doshi nahin mana janaa chahie
 After this, people started saying on social media that if Sidhu stays in Kapil's show then he will start opposing Kapil's show

 bhartiya shastreey or samakaleen nartak akaash odedra kii naveenatam prastuti haih 'ikoj' (pratidhwaniyaan)
 Born in Birmingham and living in Leicester, the 31-year-old Akash of Indian origin is a fast rising star of contemporary dance on the international board
 is tazatreen prastuti main ve manch par khadey hokar naanchaakuon kii tarah ghunghruon ko ghumaate hai, phir farsh par chaaron ore bikhri ghunghru kii laditon ke bich kathak pesh karte hai
 This hypothesis in dance, especially in the classical dance fraternity of India, can be stirred up
 ghunghruon ko aakhir koi sahaayak vastu yaa saadhan nahin, balki itnaa pavitra mana jaataa he ki har abhyaas or prastuti se pehle nartak inaki puja karte hai
 For conservatives, it is an insult to his holiness
 is nrity prastuti kii koreographer or kathak nrutyaangna aditi mangaladas kii bhi apane ghunghruon ke prati aisi hi bhavanaaen hai
 But she also knows to wow the audience and deal with furious reactions
 unki nrity prastutiyon ne kaiyon kaa dil jeeta he or unamem kai videshi kadradaan bhi hai
 By the way, there are some critics who are limited to India and consider their productions deviated from tradition
 mangaladas main ek bagawati tevar he, jiske chalate unhone 2012 main apni 'srujanatm / samakaleen'kriti ke liye mila sangeet naatak academy award thukraa diya tha
 She would accept it only when it was given to Kathak
 aditi ko pataa he ki 'ikoj' ko lekar kaisaa bavela much saktaa he, par unke liye ghunghruon kaa matlab us cheez se kahin zyada he jise ve dil kii gaharaaiyon se pyaar karti hai
 Mangaldas, 55, who started Kathak from the age of 5 in Ahmedabad, says, "ghungroo has been my all-time companion
 unase aapako kitna bhi gaharaa lagaav kyon na rahaa ho, aapako chhodia hi padataa he, jaise aapako apane andhvishwaas chhodie padate hai
 Gungru are the echo of your rhythm and your life
 '' ve aage bataati hai ki 'ikoj' main ghunghru diene ke anuon ke pratik hai jo shuru main nartak ko ghere rahete hai or aakhirkaar use agosh main le lete hai
 At the end of this 35-minute dance performance, Ghungroo is tied in Odedra's feet
 dilli ke sainik famrs main apane shandaar ghar main dewan par baithi mangaladas or odedra main itani saajha khubiyaan hai ki donon ko milakar kaam karne main koi dikkat pesh nahin ai
 Both have learned dance from eminent Kathak choreographer and Guru Kumudini Lakhia
 ek or mahaan guru pandit birju maharaj se shiksha lene ke liye mangaladas baad main dilli aa gayi
 On the other hand, Odedra also counts Neelima Devi and Asha Joglekar in their Kathak Gurus
 inke alaava unhone bharatnatyam nrutyaangna chitralekha bolaar or chaaya khanvte or jaij visheshgy shaamak dower se bhi siikhaa
 Both are Gujaratis and have become proud of their fraternity on the international board through their work
 sabase ahm ki donon hi kathak ko samakaleen vakt ke mutabik viksit karne main bharosa karte hai
 "kathak no longer occurs in temples and courts," says Odedra
 (darshakon main) ab maharaja nahin baithe hote
 It has come to the contemporary stage
 makasad yah he ki jo pehle se maujuud he, use uthaaen or zyada praasangik banaakar pesh karen
 "odhedra has received the prestigious Basie Dance Prize in 2014 for her brilliant work in the dance work Get on the Foot"
 duble-patale, furtile ekal nartak odedra bhartiya shastreey nrity or samakaleen nrity, donon kii lay ke bich aasaani se udaan bharte hai
 Among them, Mangaldas got a canvas that is the dream of any artist
 ve mangaladas kii movement ke khajaane ke liye hi gadhe gaye lagate hai, jo itnaa gatisheel he ki nartak ko shaareerik taur par khaskar, lagaataar pani kii tarah ghumaavdaar mudraon main bahane or pairon kii teevr gati ke liye majaboor kar detaa he
 The rhythmic artwork emphasizes clean physical lines and creations, and Mangaldas gradually raised the standards of his presentation to such an extent that he ironed his group choreography through his naïfé lighting design and masterful use of the stage
 yahi vajah thi ki odedra ne unase apane upar ek prastuti ko koreograph karne kii guzarish kii
 But they point out that it took them a few years to work together
 'ikoj' pehali prastuti he jise mangaladas ne aditi mangaladas dance company ke baahar koreograph kiya he yaa aise shaks ke liye taiyaar kiya he jo unka shishy nahin he
 "it was very challenging and interesting to see what could happen and how far it could go," she says
 '' baat 2014 main tab bani jab odedra ne mangaladas ko jane-maane reharsal diarector jose agudo or do anya pratibhashali nartakon ke saath ek samakaleen nrity kaaryshaala main aane kaa nyotaa diya
 In his seven years of acquaintance, Mangaldas was also influenced by Odedra's 'emotional intelligence'
 unase kaha gaya tha ki 'lay, gati, vichaar or sangeet kaa ek-ek tukdaa nakal yaa tarjuma hone kii bajaae puri tarah badla hua yaa roopantarit hoy or ise unhone puraa kaa puraa nibhaayaa
 Both Odedra and Mangaldas took 13 days to manipulate their busy schedules and made the presentation at their rehearsal studios located a few minutes from Mangaldas' house
 itane kam vakt main ise taiyaar karnaa badi chunauti thi, par mangaladas ab josh se bhari hai ki 'ikoj' ne kis tarah unhen apane kaam ko dur-dur tak pahunchane kaa mauka diya
 It also succeeded in 'breaking the invisible walls of the way Indian dance is introduced and seen in non-hindustani and South Asian audiences'
 odedra ne bhi isi duuradrushti ke saath tej kamyaabi hasil kii
 Ever since he founded his company in 2011, he has been gaining accolades
 odedra licester main kathak or birmigham main bharatnatyam shuru karne ke baad 2002 se 2004 ke bich mumbai aa gaye taaki khud ko puri tarah nrity main jhonk saken
 He ranged between Shamak's indo-jazz and Bollywood dance to Kathak and Bharatanatyam
 britain lautne ke baad ek kaaryshaala main lakhiya kii najar un par padi or 2009 main landan ke sadler wales main hue unke ekal nrity ne koreographer akram khan ko rijhaa liya
 Khan told him, "I see myself within you
" '' or unhone samakaleen nrity main apana haath aajamaane ke liye odedra par jor daalaa
 After that, he never looked back
 unhone khan, rasel melephant, cidi larbi charkovi or damien jalett jaise pratishthit samakaleen koreographer ke vijan ko nafasat ke saath jameen par utaarne ke liye acha-khaasaa naam kamaaya he
 Odhedra's first performance 'easing' (2011) has had more than 100 shows worldwide including India
 mangaladas ke saath kaam karnaa odedra kaa anjaane or bearaam raaston kii khoj kii disha main hi ek or kadam he
 He says, "to lose oneself it is necessary to lose oneself
 agar aapkaa talab hi aapaki duniya ban jaae to tarakkee ruk jaati he
 "they say that working with Mangaldas is like working with one's beloved
" kabhi mangaladas kii company se judye kii tamanna rakhane vaale odedra kehete hai, ''main unke kaam ko khud unase behatar jaanata hum
 i keep playing his clips one after the other
 '''ikoj' kaa premier hone main ab mahaj maheenaa bhar baaki he or agle saal ise bharat laane kii yojana bhi taiyaar he
 Mangaldas is not the only one associated with this performance in India
 jane-maane dampati shubha mudgal or anish pradhan ne iskaa sangeet rachaa he
 Digvijay Singh of Ahmedabad designed the costume
 yah darshakon ke dilon ke taar ched paaegaa yaa nahin, 'ikoj' se mangaladas ne yah to sabit kar hi diya he ki ve anjaani gaharaaiyon main utarane se ghabraati nahin hai
 After all, at the age of 55, he is so desperate to find himself anew

 punjab ke moga main shahid jaimal singh ke antim sanskaar ke dauraan punjab ke kisi bhi cabinet mantri ke na pahunchane ko lekar vivaad khadaa ho gaya
 In fact, Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh issued a press release late on Friday informing that he has imposed the duty of the cabinet ministers of Punjab during the funeral program of 4 martyred soldiers of Punjab, during the funeral
 Be present
 moga main shahid jaimal singh ke antim sanskaar ke liye punjab ke cabinet ministar navjot singh siddhu kii duty lagaai gai thi or is bare main sthaneey vidhayak ko or sthaneey disi or prashasan ko unke aane kii jaankaree bhi di gai thi, lekin navjot singh siddhu shahid jaimal singh ke antim sanskaar main nahin pahunche or moga naa aakar wo ludhiana main nagar nigam ke kaarykram main pahunche jahaan par unhone nagar nigam ke kaamon ko lekar kai grant jari kii
 During this, Navjot Singh Sidhu also spoke to the media but before going to the funeral of the martyr, he first reached the municipal corporation program
 apane bayaan par kaayam hai siddhunvjot singh siddhu ne ludhiana main press conference ke dauraan kaha ki unhone jo bayaan diya tha ki aatankwaad kaa koi majahab yaa desh nahin hota use galat tareeke se pesh kiya gaya or unke bayaan kii sirf ek hi line dikhaai ja rahi he jabaki agar unka puraa statement suna jaae to unhone kaha kuch or tha jiskaa matlab galat tareeke se dikhaaya ja rahaa he
 He said that the conversation started between the two countries and between the Prime Ministers of the two countries due to the act of 4 terrorists, the matter of development or the effort which has been started to open the Kartarpur Corridor should not be stopped
 shahid ke parijan bole- formality karne aae the siddhooludhiana ke baad navjot singh siddhu moga pahunche, lekin moga main shahid ke parivaar se mulaakaat karne se pehle navjot singh siddhu apane mahakme ke ek kaarykram main shirkat karne pahunch gaye
 About 3 hours after the funeral of the martyr, Navjot Singh Sidhu arrived at the martyr's house and met the family, but the meeting was nothing more than a ritual ceremony
 shahid jaimal singh ke parivaar main unke pita or bhai ne kaha ki navjot singh siddhu sirf ek formality karne ke liye unke paas pahunche the or navjot singh siddhu ko antim sanskaar main shaamil hona chahie tha
 The local administration and local Congress mlas, who deferred the question, admitted that Navjot Singh Sidhu was supposed to attend the event but could not reach it
 sthaneey disi ne kaha ki navjot singh siddhu kohre kii vajah se antim sanskaar main shaamil nahin ho sake, lekin jab unase poocha gaya ki navjot singh siddhu ludhiana main apane mahakme ke kaarykram main shaamil hue lekin moga pahunchane main unhen aakhirkaar kya pareshaani ho gai to moga ke disi sawaal ko taal gaye
 The Congress MLA alleged that local Congress mlas Darshan Brar and Harjot Mann said that the media was politicizing the issue and Navjot Singh was coming to meet the Sidhu family and could not attend the funeral for any reason
 haalanki unke antim sanskaar main aane kaa kaarykram tha, lekin is sawaal kaa unke paas jawaab nahin tha ki jab kendriya mantri harsimrat cor badal dilli se moga main shahid jaimal singh ke antim sanskaar main shaamil hone ke liye pahunch sakati hai to aakhirkaar chandigarh se navjot singh siddhu moga kyon nahin pahunch paae
 Aam Aadmi Party marked Sidhu and Aam Aadmi Party also advised Navjot Singh Sidhu to first decide whether his friend Imran Khan sitting in Pakistan is important for him or the country
 aam aadmi party ke punjab ke pradhan bhagwant maan ne shahid ke parivaar se mulaakaat karne ke baad kaha ki navjot singh siddhu ko ye dekhnaa chahie ki sankat kii is ghadi main puraa desh shahid pariwaron ke saath khadaa he
 Everyone is aware that only terrorists sitting in Pakistan are carrying out such terrorist attacks in India, in such a situation, Navjot Singh Sidhu is talking like he is a spokesperson of the Government of Pakistan and what Pakistan should do in its defense Should, she is going somewhere from Navjot Singh Sidhu jawaharlal nehru vishvavidhyalay chaatr sangh ne do websiton ke khilaaf guuruuvaar ko shikaayat darj karaate hue aarope lagaaya ki ve yah durbhaavnapurna khabaren failaa rahi hai ki santhaan ke chaatr sukama naksali hamale kaa mahimamandan kar rahe hai

 The Hague-based International Justice Court (ICJ) of the Netherlands on Wednesday upheld most of the issues raised in India's petition
 isije ne is maamle main pakistan ko latad bhi lagaai he
 The court said that Pakistan did not make Kulbhushan Jadhav aware of his rights and by doing so he violated the provisions of the Vienna Treaty

 Before them, Punjab farmer Sarabjit was also implicated in false allegations of terrorism in Pakistan
 vah anjaane main 30 agast 1990 ko seemapar pakistani ilaake main chale gaye the
 Sarabjit was charged with bombings in Lahore and Faisalabad and was sentenced to death in 1991 by a local court in Pakistan
 iske baad oonchi adaalaton main unki sajaa ko barkaraar rakhaa gaya
 Even the top court of Pakistan upheld his sentence
 unako apana jurm kabool karne ke liye yatnaaen di gayi jabaki bam visphot ke sambandh main unke khilaaf koi thos saboot nahin tha
 However, his death sentence was repeatedly deferred when the mercy petition was filed
 vahiin, bharat unako mukt karne kii baar-baar maang karata rahaa
 India maintained that it was not a spy
 sarbajit kaa pakistan main pakadaa janaa or unako maut kii sajaa sunaae jane kaa maamla vaisaa hi tha jaisaaki jadhav kaa maujuuda maamla he
 Pakistani authorities have accused Jadhav of being a spy and a terrorist by abducting him from Iran
 haalanki sarbajit ke maamle main bharat ne kabhi antarrashtriya adaalat kaa darwaja nahin khatkhataya lekin jadhav ke maamle main bharat ne maamle ko antarrashtriya adaalat main chunauti di he
 Sarabjit was brutally attacked and wounded on 26 April 2013 by prisoners at Kot Lakhpat Jail in Lahore
 haalanki hamale ke is maamle main adhikariyon par andeh jataayaa gaya tha
 His family members who went to visit him in the hospital said that the jail officials were involved in the attack

 The first budget of Modi Government Part-2 has arrived
 chunaav khatm ho chukaa he isliye bajet main hallaa hangaamaa kam he
 Its message is also that if the government's economic activities are to be seen, it has to be seen outside the budget
 jinhen sirf bajet main dekhne kii aadat he unke liye bajet main bhaashan bhi he
 The question is whether a detailed document like the budget should be seen from the fluctuations in soap oil prices or according to the money arrangements and money costs to implement those policies
 phir iske liye bhaashan ke alaava us hisse ko dekhnaa hoga jise vitt mantri nirmala sitaraman ne nahin padhaa
 Now those who have worked hard will read the paper according to the budget expenditure and will tell you
 vitt mantri ne kaha ki is vitt varsh main hi bharat kii arthvyavastha kaa aakaar 3 trillian dollar kaa ho jayega
 2 at the moment
 7 trillian dollars kaa he
 India's economy had grown to $ 1 trillion in 55 years
 pichley paanch saal main hi sarkaar ne iskaa aakaar 1 trillian yani ek trillian dollar badha diya he
 Trillion dollar economy
 ek nayaa sapana to he lekin kya yah nayaa paimaana bhi he
 Are we deliberately turning this scale into slogans so that the rest of the place is not seen and lost in the dream
 kya 55 saal se tulana karnaa sahi hoga, vitt mantri ne kaha ki 55 saal main 1 trilayan dollar tak bharat pahunchaa lekin ham paanch saal main hi 
 Could add $ 9 trillion
 ek trillian hi maniye ise
 With this, the Finance Minister not only dismissed the previous governments in a queue, but other governments of the world are also rejected by this statement
 vishwa bank ke aankade ke anusaar 55 saal pehle yani 1964 main duniya kii arthvyavastha kaa saise 1
 Was 8 trillion dollars
 2014 main duniya kii arthvyavastha kaa saise 79
 Was 29 trillion dollars
 is vakt duniya kii arthvyavastha kaa saise 87 trillian dollar he
 In 1964, when the size of the world economy was less than today's India, how can you suddenly say that what we could not do in 55 years, we did in the last five years
 vitt mantri ne kaha ki aaj bharat kaa sthaan duniya main chatha he
 It was 11th in the world five years ago
 phir bhi dekhie jab duniya kii iconmi kaa aakaar 2 trillian dollar nahin tha tab 1964 bharat kii arthvyavastha kaa aakaar 56
 48 billion dollars
 us saal duniya main bharat kaa sthaan 7waan tha
 That year India overtook Canada
 america, britain, france, china, japan or italy aage the bharat se
 55 years ago, India was ranked seventh
 2019 main chatha he
 Now you will feel fine, but do not tell this in detail and say that what has not happened in 55 years, it would have happened in the last 5 years that we would have been living in darkness
 vaise azaadi ke vakt bharat ek garib desh tha
 His economy was empty
 zaahir he us vakt aisa nahin hoga jaisaa aaj he
 But we should handle the slogans of 55 years and 70 years
 aaj kal prati vyakti aay kii baat kyon nahin ho rahi he
 If India did its economy 1 in 5 years
 85 trillian dollar se 2
 75 trillion dollars, then our progress in per capita income
 antarrashtriya mudra kosh ke aankade ke anusaar 187 main 2018 main bharat prati vyakti aay ke maamle main duniya main 142wein number par tha
 In 2014, India was number 169 in the world in terms of per capita income
 sudhaar to hua lekin hamaari pragati kii sachai is aankade main bhi dikhti he
 Are you being told that in 2018, countries like Ghana, Nigeria, Nicaragua, Sri Lanka were ahead of India in terms of per capita income
 ham prati vyakti aay kii baat kyon nahin karte hai jisase pataa chale ki jab iconmi kaa saise badhata he to logon kii aamadani kitni badhati he
 Is the man no more important, everything has become a size? kya america ke prophessoron ne apni class main prati vyakti aay ke bare main padhaanaa band kar diya he
 Or the trillion dollar thing is happening because it sounds new and big
 lekin isse ham apni aarthik hakeekat ko kab tak chipa sakate hai
 So do not interpret speech with slogan and do not rely on channels to understand slogan
 bajet paper khud bhi padhie
 The government says that in 5 years we will become an economy of $ 5 trillion, but many economists are asking that even if it is 8 percent GDP, it will take 9 years
 paanch saal main dabl karne ke liye 12 pratishat kii jidipi chahie
 The government says that if there is 8 percent GDP for five years, then there can be an economy of $ 5 trillion
 yah kaise hoga to sarkaar is sawaal kaa jawaab aashaa, vishwaas or aakanksha ke naare se detii he or shaayari se detii he
 'if you believe, there is a way out, even with the wind, the lamp burns
 ' is bajet main ek bada parivartan hua he corporate tex ke dhaanche main
 The government is already on track to reduce corporate tax
 pehle 250 karod tak ke turnover vaali companiyon ko 25 pratishat corporate tex dene hote the
 Now companies with turnover up to 400 crores will have to pay 25 percent corporate tax
 is tarah se bharat kii 99
 Corporate tax increased to 25 percent for 3 percent of companies
 sirf 0
 There are 7 percent companies that will have to pay 30 percent corporate tax
 vitt mantri ne kaha ki 99
 3 percent of the companies fell within the 25 percent range
 lekin 2016-17 main vitt mantri jetali ne jab 250 karod tak ke turnover vaali companiyon ko 25 pratishat ke daayre main laayaa tha to kaha tha ki 99 pratishat companiyon ko laabh milegaa
 Nirmala Sitharaman did not state that 99
 3 pratishat companiyon ko 25 pratishat ke daayre main laane se sarkaar kii rajasav vasuuli kitni kam hogi
 When Jaitley had reduced the tax for 99 percent of the companies, then he said that the government will not get 7000 crore revenue in 2018-19 from this step
 ritern file karne vaaleen 7 lakh companiyon main 7000 companiyaan hi hai jinka turnover 250 karod se adhik he
 They will be placed in a corporate tax slab of 30 percent
 us vakt vitt mantri ne kaha tha ki karporate tex ghataane se rojgaar main vruddhi hogi
 We do not know officially how much employment was created by giving tax exemption of 7000 crores
 2 karod se kam kamaane vaale logon ke tex slab main koi badlaav nahin hua he
 The government has demanded more tax from those earning more than that
 pratyaksh kar kii vasuuli 78 pratishat kii dar se badi he
 Collection of direct tax in 2013-14 6
 38 lakh karod thi
 Recovery of direct tax during 2018-19 11
 37 lakh karod ho gai he
 Make in India was the slogan for the last five years
 mek in india to nahin gaya he lekin kya usase bhi bada koi nayaa naaraa aa gaya he
 The Finance Minister has said that she is going to call global companies so that they can build mega manufacturing plants
 iske liye sarkaar ne kuch kshetra tay kiye gaye hai jinhen sunraise or advance technalji kaha jaataa he
 It is being said that due to the commercial war between the US and China, many companies want to set up their factories elsewhere than China
 bharat is maukey kaa laabh samay rahete uthaanaa chahta he
 People who already own a house, if they buy a second house up to 45 lakh, then they will get a rebate of one and a half lakh in tax
 vitt mantri ne bataaya ki 15 saal main is tarah do gharon par kisi ko saat lakh kii bachat hogi
 Since the number of seven lakhs seems to be large, the government said seven lakhs, but if you look at the month, then there will be a saving of Rs 3888 every month
 kya pehle tex didction kaa laabh is tarah se bataaya jaataa tha, abhi yaad nahin he lekin yah dilachasp laga
 Those who have spent more than 2 lakhs on foreign travel will have to file tax
 jinka saal bhar kaa bijli bill 1 lakh se adhik hoga, unhen tex file karnaa hoga
 Income tax department can file tax returns on its behalf to tax payers
 isse tex ritern kaa samay or jhanjhat bhi bachegaa, tex ritern main galati bhi nahin hogi
 Nirmala Sitharaman had said in the Lok Sabha in response to a question that cash was in circulation before demonetisation, more cash is now in the market
 shaayad isiilie praavdhaan kiya gaya he ki ek karod se adhik cash nikaalane par 2 pratishat tids lagegaa
 Will this reduce the movement of cash
 pehle ke kiye gaye tamaam upayon se cash kaa chalan kam nahin hua he
 When the Finance Minister read his speech, there was no book of expenditure in it which is called Expenditure
 vitt mantri ne apane bhaashan ke baad kaha ki expendichar ke paper rakhe ja rahe hai magar unhen padhaa nahin gaya he
 There has been a lot of controversy about this
 chennai jaisaa mahanagar sookhe se jujh rahaa he
 There is no mention of this budget for him
 is samay pani kaa sankat bharat ke har kshetra main alag alag rup main he
 It was informed in the budget that the government has formed the Ministry of Water Power, the Department of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation, drinking water and sanitation
 yah mantralay rajyon ke saath milakar har ghar jal yojana par kaam karegaa or 2024 tak gaanvon ke sabhi gharon ko pipe se pani degaa
 Nitish Kumar has implemented this scheme in Bihar
 bihar sarkaar kaa daawa he ki agle saal tak yah yojana puri ho jaaegi
 But under this, lakhs of submersible pumps are being installed in Bihar only with government money
 aaj haalat yah he ki uttar bihar jahaan pani sataha ke upar nazar aata tha, vahaan pani nahin he
 Should every household plan to provide water through a submersible pump, then it should be considered once
 sarkaar ne kaha he ki varsha jal sanchay, bhumigat jal ko richarge kaa dhaancha taiyaar kiya jayega
 One more thing is important
 vitt mantri ne kaha he ki gharon se nikalne vaale gande pani ko saaf kiya jayega or kheti main istamaal hoga
 No concrete plan of how this will be done, no budget will be known
 kya sarkaar ne is kaam ke liye paryaapt paise die hai
 When we looked into the budgeted eating menu, it was found that there was an increase of only 657 crore as compared to the previous budget
 2019-20 ke liye jalashakti mantralay kaa kul bajet 28,261 karod he
 The total budget in the 2018-19 budget was 27,604 crores
 lekin isamen rural drinking water kaa bajet 5500 karod se badhaakar 10,000 karod kiya gaya
 But the budget of this ministry has increased by only 657 crores, so will the money of other schemes now be pumped from the tap to water, then what will happen to the schemes already running
 kya ve puri ho gai hai yaa adhuraa chhod diya jayega
 This is all a question
 jaise elaan kiya gaya ki pradhanmantri matsay sampada yojana laanch hogi
 Look at the budget of the fisheries department first
 machhlipaalan mantralay kaa bajet 804 karod he lekin pichhlaa bajet kitna tha yah expendichar vaale khaane main kyon nahin bataaya gaya he
 However, the budget for dairy and animal husbandry has also reduced
 anganwari kaa bajet badha he
 Save the daughter, the budget of Beti Padhao has not increased
 vitt mantri ne bharat main padhane ke liye videshi chaatro ko protsaahit karne ke liye study in india kii shuruyaat kii baat kahi he
 But is this scheme any different from that for which Sushma Swaraj launched a website on 18 April 2018
 is website kaa naam he Study in India Portal
 This press release is available on pib's site
 yah yojana maanav sansaadhan mantralay kii he
 It was launched by Sushma Swaraj and former minister Satyapal Singh
 160 sansthaaon kii 15,000 seat videshi chaatro ke liye rakhe jane kii baat thi
 The event took place at the India Habitat Center
 jo kaarykram ek saal pehle shuru ho chukaa he use is baar ke bajet main nayaa kaarykram shuru karne kii baat kii gai he
 a video message of the then HRD minister Prakash Javadekar was also released at that event
 pichley bajet main vald class institution banane ke liye 250 karod kaa praavdhaan tha magar asal main diya gaya 128 karod
 This time it has been said that 400 crores will be given
 ise institute of eminance kaha gaya tha magar yah shabd hi nahin he
 Once the budget was presented in the evening, Vajpayee started appearing in the round at 11 o'clock
 ab parampara 11 baje kii he
 Railway budget was presented separately, now the tradition is new
 rail bajet aam bajet kaa hissaa he
 But today another change took place
 abhi tak aap jaan chuke hai ki vitt mantri nirmala sitaraman ne aaj ek paripati badali
 Earlier the Finance Minister used to present the budget in the briefcase

 The budget was wrapped in scarlet cloth instead of briefcase
 jaise vyapaaree bahikhaate ko lapet kar rakhte hai or bahikhaate kaa rang bhi laal hi hota he
 This can be debated separately but it should be taken into consideration by what Chief Economic Advisor Krishnamurthy Subramanian said
 unhone kaha ki yah bhartiya parampara he jo bataa rahaa he ki ham pashchimi vichaaron kii gulaami se nikal aae hai
 His statement has been tweeted by the Times of India
 bajet pesh karne main nai panrparaayein banati rahati hai, puraani tuutati rahati hai
 It should be seen as this
 ati utsaahi aarthik salaahkaar ne kaha ki ham pashchimi vichaaron kii gulaami se nikal aae hai
 Was it necessary to say slavery? But the same economists were telling the day before that how India's economy is inspired by the views of a professor at the University of Chicago, USA
 kya vah pashchim ke vichaaron kii gulaami kahi jaaegi, jabaki khud arthshaastri ji pashchimi vastra parampara main susajjit nazar aae
 The budget, which has all kinds of ideas, there is an idea from there, should have thought before making such a sentimental statement about that budget, that the finance minister of this government kept presenting the budget in the brief case itself
 kya paanch bajet pesh karne vaale jetali ko kabhi yaad hi nahin aayaa ki yah brifces paashchaatya vichaaron kii ghulaami he
 Did Piyush Goyal not even notice
 badlaav kaa shrey lenaa chahie lekin jhat se gulaami se jodne se pehle sochna chahie ki ye gulaami nahin he
 If it is slavery, then everything around us should be removed
 sabase pehle cell phone hataa dena chahie, digital india band kar dena chahie
 stand-up India is also a scheme of the Government of India

 After Hyderabad, the Delhi government has brought many such vehicles
 ye gaadiyaan bhi isi model kii hai
 When the Delhi government pulled out the tender for this, Dikki (dalit Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry) helped in building a business model
 or phir un pariwaron ko is bijness ke liye taiyaar kiya gaya jinke yahaan gater saaf karte hue maut hui thi
 It has 10 families

 The Finance Minister has also said that cheap houses will be built on the vacant land of public sector, which has given the common people a home

 The government has said that it will give 70,000 crore to the banks

 Import duty on gold has been increased
 bajet main yah bhi he ki railway main 2030 tak 50 lakh ke nivesh honge
 This will be done in collaboration with the private sector
 kya isse railway main bade paimaane par nijeekaran hoga
 Its call was already there, but it seems that after the new mandate, the government will now move fast in this direction
 bajet main yah bhi kaha gaya he ki kendriya mantralayon or saarvajanik kshetra kii companiyon ke paas jo zaminein hai unka bhi istamaal hoga
 By using this, you should also understand that they can be sold or infrastructure can be built on them in private sector partnership

 Monday, February 11 was an important day for the Congress, which had been out of power in Uttar Pradesh for almost three decades
 is din congress ne apane turup ke pattey ke taur par priyanka gandhi wadra ko aupchaarik taur par uttar pradesh main khastahal ho chuki party ko ubaarane ke liye maidan main utaar diya
 Around 12 in the morning
 30 baje lakhanu ke choudhary charan singh airport mode se priyanka-rahul kaa road sho shuru hua or dopaher baad pradesh congress daftar pahunchaa
 During this time, the enthusiasm of the Congress workers was visible
 ye kaaryakarta upi ke alag-alag jilon- kanpur, unnav, sitapur, lakhimpur, faijabad, sultanpur, pratapgarh, amethi, raibareli, barabanki, faijabad se swaagat ke liye pahunch the
 During the road show, Rahul and Priyanka were seen applying black spot
 rahul-priyanka ne apanaaya totaka?bhartiya samaaj main kaala tikaa or kaala dhaagaa totake or prasad ke rup main kai sthanon par prachlit he
 So did Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra use it as a trick during the road show so that they could avoid any evil eye? In Lucknow, the areas where the convoys of these two Congress leaders passed, people kept talking on this issue throughout the day
 congress ko lagi buree najar?aise main sawaal uthta he ki kya congress maanati he upi main use buree najar lag gai he or priyanka kaa raajnneeti main aana or unka kaala dhaagaa baandhna use buree najar se bachaa paaegaa? agar uttar pradesh kii raajnneeti main congress kii sthiti par najar daali jaae to saaf pataa chalata he ki use kisi kii 'najar' lagi he
 That is why the party never returned to power of the state after 1989
 is dauraan kai chunaav aae or gaye, lekin party kii sthiti main koi bada sudhaar nahin ho paaya
 In these 30 years, only 2009 election was like this, when the party got 21 Lok Sabha seats
 baaki kisi bhi chunaav main congress ko ullekhneey kamyaabi nahin mili
 This thinness of the Congress can only be gauged from the fact that in Uttar Pradesh, this party has only 2 mps and 6 mlas and 1 Legislative Council Member (MLC)
 iske alaava soobe main party kaa vot pratishat single disit main he
 Due to the emergence of mandal-kamandal politics, many reasons are believed to be responsible for the decay of the Congress in the Congress
 lekin mandal-kamandal kii raajnneeti iske liye sabase bada kaaran maani jaati he
 In the last years of the 1980s, the Ram temple movement in Ayodhya gained momentum, the bjp's political graph kept climbing
 ise hi kamandal kii raajnneeti kaha gaya
 Meanwhile, around the same time the Mandal Commission recommendations were implemented and 27 percent reservation in education and government jobs was given to the OBC class
 is mudde ko lekar desh main virodh or samarthan kaa jabardast maahaul bana to jaateey golbandi kii raajnneeti shuru ho gai
 The result of Mandal's politics was that caste and its identity became a big issue of politics
 or shaayad isi kaa nateeja tha ki upi main samaajawaadee party, bahujan samaaj party or bihar main rashtriya janata dal jaisi partiyaan majboot hoti chali gayi
 As the rival politics between Mandal and Kamandal intensified, political space for the Congress became less and less

 uttar pradesh ke noida shahar ko lekar bhi lambey samay tak yah manyata rahi ki yahaan upi kaa jo mukhyamantri aayega, uski kursi kuch samay baad chali jaaegi
 This recognition was strengthened when leaders like Narayan Dutt Tiwari, Mulayam Singh Yadav had to go to Noida and lose the chair shortly thereafter
 yahi vajah he ki rajnath singh, mayawati or akhilesh yadav upi ke siem ke rup main jab tak kaam karte rahe, kabhi noida nahin aae
 But this recognition was broken by the current CM of UP Yogi Adityanath

 sahakaarita mantri govind singh ne aresas par bam banane kii training dene kaa aarope lagaaya he

 Now he was in the government for 15 years hence the matter was buried and in it came the name of his Pragya Thakur to whom he has given all the comforts for 15 years in the name of sickness'

 Rahul Gandhi has said that he did not violate the code of conduct when in Shahdol he said that the Modi government has enacted a law in which tribals are allowed to shoot
 rahul ne chunaav ayog se yah bhi kaha he ki vah aachaar samhita ke ulanghan se judi shikayaton kaa nipataara karte vakt nishpaksh rahe or congress ke khilaaf bhedbhaavpurn ravaiya na apanaae
 On allegations of violation of the code of conduct, Rahul Gandhi said that he was trying to explain the proposed amendment to the Indian Forest Law in a simple manner in one of his speeches
 rahul gandhi kii daleel he ki van kanoon 1927 kii dhara 66 main sanshodhan ke sarkari prastaav par apane bhaashan kii rau main bol rahe the

 On this statement of Rahul, the Election Commission issued him a show cause notice
 congress adhyaksh ne ayog ko yah bhi bataaya ki bijepi ne unhen loksabhaa chunaav main prachaar karne se rokane ke liye unke khilaaf shikaayat darj karai thi kyonki vah ek raajnneetik party ke pramukh hai or uske star prachaarak bhi hai
 Rahul said that his criticism was limited to the policies, programs and actions of the Modi government
 congress adhyaksh ne kaha ki chunaav loktantr main lokapriy bhaawanaaon kii abhivyakti he or jab tak vichaaron ke swatantra prachaar-prasar kii anumit nahin di jaati he chunaav kaa uddeshy puraa nahin hoga
 He also said that it is necessary for democracy to keep the flaws and features of government policies in front of the public and ask them to take decisions on them
 nishpaksh, gaiyr-bhedbhaavpurn drushtikon rakhe chunaav yograhul gandhi ne chunaav ayog se kaha ki ayog partiyon ke khilaaf kii gai shikayaton par karrwai karte vakt nishpaksh, gaiyr-bhedbhaavpurn, gaiyr-manamaana or santulit drushtikon apanaae
 He cited several statements made by BJP leaders, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP President Amit Shah, during the election campaign, in which many leaders used the words 'objectionable'

 Bundela explains that no matter what happens, they are definitely involved in the event
 haalanki unki kamjor najar ab unka saath nahin de rahi
 During the bout, Bundela aimed the gun from the scaffold towards the target but could not see the target clearly
 isliye unhone apni rifl neeche kar di
 The crowd of the audience present praised his spirit and greeted him with applause
 bundelkhand main us din devi-devtaa ke saath-saath banduukon kii bhi puja kii jaati he
 The day after Rakshabandhan, Khajuraho, the city of temples famous for love and art, becomes as if the city is preparing for a war

 The contest is organized near the Shiv Sagar lake in the heart of the city
 is mukaable main bade bor vaali riflon se nishaanaa sadhakar mitti ke matakon ko tukade-tukade karnaa hota he
 Legend has it that on the day of Rakshabandhan in Bundelkhand, the knights of the Chandel army, Alha and Udal, retaliated against the army of Prithviraj Chauhan who came for the battle
 aalha or oodal kii veerta kii kahani loakgeet ke rup main gaakar sunai jaati he

 Then the shooting competition begins

 He is the most beloved shooter of the people present there and whenever he penetrates a pot, the crowd is filled with enthusiasm

 On the way to the goal, the participants express their respect by touching the steps of the loft
 matake ko nishaanaa banane ke baad pratibhaagi maharaj vikram singh ke sammaan main unke saamne sir jhukaakar unka abhivadan karte hai
 Vikram Singh is present with his wife Kavita

 '' alok singh enesji ke prashikshak hai or is nishanebaaji mukaable main upavijeta chune gaye
 The contest has been held for decades, but it is often complained that it is illegal and can endanger people's lives
 lekin prashasan bhi isamen kabhi hastkshep nahin karata
 Perhaps he has an idea that this tradition will also get entangled in events like Gotmar and Jallikattu in which traditions dominate security
 ujjain ke paas sthit lalgarh ke abhijatya varg se taalluk rakhane vaale hanuvant singh kehete hai, "main kareeb do dashakon se is mukaable main aa rahaa hum
 "they say that the celebration of Kshatriya traditions has been established in Bundelkhand from the beginning

 He said that recently the Jammu and Kashmir administration organized a 'back to Village' program in which the entire government machinery, not the people, had to reach the people

 Common citizens appreciated this program

 Today is the 69th death anniversary of Sardar Patel - why did not Patel become the first PM of India's freedom struggle fighter and the 69th death anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the first home minister of independent India
 1947 main bharat kii azaadi ke baad pehle teen saal up pradhanmantri, grahamantri, soochna mantri or rajya mantri rahe the
 But have you ever wondered how it was decided after India's independence, not Sardar Patel, but Jawaharlal Nehru Azad will be elected the first Prime Minister of India
 louh purush sardaar vallabhbhai patel kaa nidhan aaj hi 15 disambar, 1950, maharashtra main hua tha
 When Modi said- 'patel would have been the first Prime Minister of the country, the picture of India would have been something else'
 Addressing a forum, the current Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi said that 'till today in every Indian's mind there is a question that the country Sardar Patel did not become the first Prime Minister of India
 agar patel desh ke pehle pradhanmantri hote to bharat kii tasviir kuch or hoti
 Now the question arises here, for what reasons Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel kept on becoming Prime Minister and he had to be content with the post of Deputy Prime Minister
 mana jaataa jawahar laal nehru congress main the, tab tak to aisa nahin ho paata
 This is how India got its first Prime Minister on 15 August 1947, the country got independence
 1946 main british sarkaar ne cabinet mishan plan banaaya, jiske tahat kuch angrej adhikariyon ko ye jimmedaari mili ki ve bharat kii aazaadee ke liye bhartiya netaaon se baat karen
 It was decided that an interim government will be formed in India
 us samay bharat ke pehle shiksha mantri moulana abul kalam aaazaad congress party ke adhyaksh the
 1946 meeting The Congress Working Committee meeting was convened in April 1946 to search for the Prime Minister
 is baithak main mahatma gandhi, jawahar laal nehru, sardaar patel, acharya kriplani, rajendra prasad, khan abdul gaffaar khan sahit kai bade congressi netaa shaamil the
 Let me tell you, Maulana Abdul Kalam did not want to leave the post of the President of the Congress Party, but he had to leave this post at the behest of Mahatma Gandhi, after which Mahatma Gandhi wanted Pandit Nehru to be the President of the Congress
 kyonki us daur main vah ek lokapriy netaa the
 At that time, the provincial Congress committees used to elect the post of Congress President
 aise main kisi bhi prantiy congress cameti ne jawahar laal nehru kaa naam adhyaksh pad ke liye prastaavit nahin kiya tha
 Of the 15, 12 Provincial Congress Committees, Sardar Patel's name and 3 remaining committees were proposed in the meeting, the names of then party General Secretary Acharya JB Kripalani and Pattabhi Sitaramaiya
 aise main ye tay tha ki congress ke adhyaksh ke rup main sardaar patel ke paas zyada logon kii sahmati he
 At the same time, Jawahar Lal Nehru's name was not far and wide
 mahatma gandhi ke dabaav main aayaa nehru kaa namamahatma gandhi hi the jo nehru ko bharat kaa pehla pradhanmantri banate hue dekhnaa chaahate the
 After this Acharya Kripalani had to say, 'I offer the name of Jawaharlal for the post of President, while respecting Bapu's feelings
 ' yah kehete hue acharya kriplani ne ek kaagaj par jawahar laal nehru kaa naam khud se prastaavit kar diya tha
 Due to the pressure of Mahatma Gandhi, Patel had also agreed that Nehru would become the next Prime Minister
 bataa den, gandhi ne adhyaksh pad ke liye sardaar patel ke naam kaa prastaav nahin diya tha
 Mahatma Gandhi had stated the reason "jawaharlal Nehru as Congress president could negotiate a settlement better than the British rule"
 vahiin 2 oktober, 1950 ko indore main ek mahila centre kaa udghaatan karne gayi patel ne apane bhaashan main kaha tha ki 'ab mahatma hamaare bich nahin rahe hai nehru hi hamaare netaa hai
 Bapu appointed him as his successor and announced it
 ab yah baapu ke sipaahiyon kaa kartavya he ki ve unke nirdesh kaa paalan karen or main ek gaiyr-vafaadaar sipaahi nahin hum
 All this evidence is based on the book 'after Bharat Gandhi' by author Ramachandra Guha and some other sources
 sukhiryon main rahane vaali pop gayika ladi gaaga or unke purv bwyfriend lack karl ek baar phir ek ho gaye hai or donon ne apane sambandhon ko phir se tarotaaja karne kii koshish karne kaa faisla kiya he
 In May this year, Gaga (25) announced her separation with Karl (30)
 yues online patrika ne khabar di he ki donon ne phir se ek hone kaa faisla kiya he
 a source said, 'there was a minor quarrel between the two, i think it has been a couple of weeks of separation between the two but now both are together

 a 19-year-old man was allegedly shot and killed by his friend in the national capital
 yah vaardaat us vakt hui jab ve pistaul ke saath mobile ap tiktaoc par ek video bana rahe the
 The police gave this information on Sunday

 On returning, Sohail, sitting next to Salman driving the car, took out a country-made pistol
 unhone video banane kii koshish ke dauraan salmaan par nishaanaa saadhaa, lekin pistaul se nikali goli uske baayen gaal par lagi
 Police said that Aamir Creta was sitting on the back seat of the car

 The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) has introduced a cleanliness in gestures amidst the growing debate over intolerance in the country
 aresas pramukh mohan bhagwat ne kaha he kai baar jaankaree ke abhaav main bhram kii sthiti paidaa ho jaati he
 He also made it clear that RSS is neither a political organization, nor has any political ideology
 'jaisaa dekhnaa chaahate hai, vaisaa najar aata he'mohan bhagwatne apane fasebuk pej par ek lanbaa-chaudaa post daalaa he
 In it, he wrote, 'my own face looks scary in the mirror in low light at night
 aksar jaankaree ke abhaav main, ham kisi bhi vishay ko vaisaa hi dekhte hai, jaisaa dekhnaa chaahate hai
 Whatever scene we see is not necessarily a reality
 jaankaree ke abhaav main kai baar ham apni maansikta ke drushtikon par hi vaastaviktaa kaa drishy nirdhaarit kar lete hai
 
 
 "not aspiring to be the architect of governance", Mohan Bhagwat wrote that it is necessary to clarify some things about the Sangh, so that there is no possibility of doubt
 unhone likhaa he, 'sangh koi raajnneetik nahin, balki ek saamaajik or saanskrithik sanghathan he, jisaki nijee koi vichaardhaara hi nahin he
 The idea of india is its reality
 na hi dainik raajnneeti main sangh kii ruchi he, or na hi ise shashan tantra kaa sutaradhar banane kii koi aakanksha he
 'the RSSRSS chief has dedicated in the service for the last 90 years, further wrote,' The person who has shown the way to rebuild the nation through the process of construction by Swami Vivekananda ji, the Sangh is devoted to the same work for the last 90 years
 ''rajaneta bananaa sangh kaa kaam nahin'fasebuk par mohan bhagwat ne sangh ke bare main bhram dur karne kii koshish karte hue likhaa, 'sangh kaa kaam rajaneta bananaa nahin, balki samaaj main aisi peedi kaa nirmaan karnaa he, jinka vivek satya or asaty main antar karne main sakasham ho, unhen dharm-adharm, nyaay-anyaay kaa gyaan ho
 Whatever field such a generation will choose for itself, it is natural that they will be leading there

 In fact, on Monday, a meeting was convened by the All India Jat Reservation Sangharsh Samiti at Ramlila Maidan in Delhi

 4 lakh crore rupees
 ye sari deal aakhri din shanghai main china kii companiyon ke saath piem kii baithak main huin
 22 billion dollars will not come at a time, it is not that the entire 22 billion dollars will come to India in the next few months
 jo deal hui hai wo darasal nivesh kaa iraadaa hai, jise takneekee turm main expressant of intent kehete hai
 It cannot be said with certainty that this investment is going to come in India
 ye sarkaar kii jimmedaari he ki wo in companiyon ke liye aisa maahaul paidaa kare ki unhen apane iraade par amal main koi dikkat na ho
 Perhaps this is the reason why PM Modi in the meeting with the companies did not hesitate to say that he would directly supervise his projects
 kul 21 samjhaute hue jinamein se sabase zyada 8 companiyaan power sector kii hai
 Whenever these agreements come into force, they can be expected to help a lot in solving the power problem of the country

 Focus on Power Crisis: The real focus of PM Modi's trip abroad to three countries is electricity crisis

 Voting day is a chance to show solidarity
 lekin 8 farvari ko matdaan ke pehle charan ke din uttar pradesh ke congressi diggaj ek-duusare par pil pade
 The beginning was made by Union Steel Minister Beni Prasad Verma, 71 years old
 unhone barabanki ke saansad or rashtriya anusuchit jati ayog ke adhyaksh pi
 L
 punia par hamalaa bolte hue unhen bahari qaraar diya
 The new and old stalwarts of the Congress expressed their displeasure over the injury caused by the sting
 1 farvari ko congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne benny prasad verma ke nirvachan kshetra gonda se uttar pradesh main chunaav prachaar kii shuruyaat kii
 But when Benny Babu took over the mic, slogans started against him
 isse stabdh sonia ne unhen peeche hat jane kaa ishaara kiya
 On 25 November, Beni was present at the public meeting of Congress General Secretary Rahul Gandhi in Utraula area of gonda
 rahul ke kehane par benny ne jaise hi mike sambhala, sabha main upasthit log 'benny verma waapas jaao' ke naare lagane lage
 Even after Rahul's explanation, the public was not ready to listen to Beni
 is tarah kaa drishy aksar cartoon filmon main dekhne ko mil saktaa haih ranbheri baj gai he, maidan main fouj ne morcha sambhaal liya he or rajkumaar jaise hi dushman par hamale kaa 'km detaa he, uske senapati or sainik aage badhkar hamalaa karne kii bajaae aapas main hi markat shuru kar dete hai
 This is the position of the Congress in the area of beni Prasad Verma 'beni Babu', Union Steel Minister in the Terai region of Uttar Pradesh
 is bich duusari sabhaaon main bhi kurmiyon ke swayambhu netaa benny babu kaa jamkar virodh hua
 They are not opposed by the SP, BSP or BJP workers, but the Congress workers and officials who are protesting against the apathetic and arbitrary attitude of the high command
 pehle charan main matdaan ke din 8 farvari ko benny prasad verma ne apana kaaphi samay bete rakesh verma kii chunaav seat dariyabad (jila barabanki) main bitaayaa
 It is not considered good in politics to focus on a particular constituency of a big leader
 is seat ko jeetne ke liye verma parivaar ne kitna jor lagaaya he iskaa andaja is baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki yahaan congress mahasachiv rahul gandhi, digvijay singh, salmaan khurshid or raaj babbar kii sabhaayen huin
 In fact, the Congress, which had been away from power in the state for nearly two decades, felt that Rahul's UP mission could not be achieved without the support of 54 per cent OBC voters
 party ko gaiyr-yadav obisi matadaataaon ko rijhaane ke liye benny babu se behatar koi vikalp nahin soojha or mantrimandal ke july, 2011 ke pherbadal main unhen rajyamantri se cabinet mantri kaa darja de diya gaya
 The party high command quickly forgot that Beni, who made a political career due to opposition from the Congress, may have entered his camp due to political compulsion but he cannot be taught the culture and tradition of the Congress
 kabhi samaajawaadee party (sapa) pramukh mulaayam singh yadav ke behad kareebi rahe benny ke bare main ek varisht congressi netaa bataate hai ki pichhlaa loksabhaa chunaav gonda se jeetne ke baad benny ginati ke maukon par hi gonda aae hai
 Gonda will probably be the only parliamentary constituency in the state where the MP has no office
 log apane saansad ke udasin ravaie se pehle hi naaraaz ho chuke the or rahi-sahi kasar benny ne pratyaashiyon kaa chayan karke puraa kar diya
 Out of the 55 seats in the first phase, at least 30 seats were nominated as candidates for the Union Steel Minister and old Congress contenders were ignored
 gonda jile main kul saat vidhansabha kshetra hai-katra bazaar, tarbganj, manakaapur (surakshit), gaura, mahanun or gonda sadar
 In Gonda Sadar and Mankapur (reserved) assembly constituencies, Kurmi voters are between 5000-10,000 while in the rest of the assembly constituencies it is between 30,000 and 60,000
 yahaan par tikat bantwaare main puri tarah se benny kii chali
 Madan Mohan Chaudhary was given ticket from Kurna dominated area Mahanoun while Congress state secretary Satyadev Singh was preparing to contest from here
 tarbganj se congress pratyaashee pehle sapa se tikat maang rahe the
 When SP rejected their claim, they became rebellious and Beni got them a Congress ticket
 gonda main logon kii naaraazgi kii ek vajah benny prasad verma kaa jile ke vikaas main ruchi na lenaa he
 At a dozen places in the steel minister's constituency, people are forced to use wooden bridges while the government has banned the Pile Setu (wooden bridge) across the state
 gonda ko lakhanu se jodne vaale mukhya maarg par balpur pul beete ek saal se kshatigrast he
 Supporters of Beni have also cracked down on Kurmi-dominated settlements Murhidiya, Mullari, Pipra, Bihrua, Sohsa, Sisaur, Andhupur on Ghata to Utraula road
 murhidia gaanv main chaay kaa thela lagane vaale ramdarsh verma bataate hai, 'hamaare vot lekar benny loksabhaa chunaav jite, mantri bane lekin gaanv kii dasha nahin badali
 Before the election, Beni had promised to provide electricity, roads in the village within a year but nothing has happened so far
 ' kurmi bahulya ilaake ke salpur bazaar or iske aasapaas rahane vaale log benny se khaase naaraaz hai
 Singh Raj Verma, a resident of Panivallabh Gram Sabha here, says that his fraternity voted for Beni that he would develop the same way as he did while being a member of Barabanki but after the elections, Beni did not take any notice of the area
 
 congress bhale hi benny ko pichde varg kaa netaa maan rahi he lekin hakeekat yah he ki benny swayan jeet ke liye keval kurmi voton par hi bharosa karte hai
 This was the reason that in the last Lok Sabha elections, he broke away from his traditional Kaiserganj seat because the Kurmi votes were reduced there due to delimitation
 is baar vidhansabha chunaav main apane bete rakesh verma ko jitaane ke liye benny ne phir kurmi voton kaa guna bhaag kiya
 He fielded Rakesh from Daryabad assembly seat where Kurmi caste has a significant number of votes
 haalanki is seat par puraane congressi netaa shivashankar shukla chunaav ladane kii taiyaari kar rahe the
 This decision was strongly opposed and Shukla got a scuffle with his supporters in the presence of Beni and Rakesh at an event in November
 benny or unke bete par hatya ke prayaas kaa mukadmaa bhi darj hua
 Beni did not allow other obcs or Dalit leaders to run within the Congress
 barabanki kii loksabhaa seat jitkar bhale hi pi
 L
 punia ne yahaan par arase baad congress kaa paracham laharaaya ho lekin yahaan kii chah vidhansabha siton par ummidavaaron ke chayan main benny kii hi chali
 Like Gonda, in Barabanki, apart from the old Congress workers, Beni gave him a Congress ticket as a gift from the opposition
 chunaav main apane bete kii raah aasaan karne ke liye benny ne dariyabad kii bagal kii seat jaidpur par bhaajapa ke purv saansad baijnath ravat ko congress kaa tikat dilvaaya taaki paasi birdari ke maton ko saadhaa ja sake
 In Barabanki assembly constituency, the Congress ticket was won by Chhote Lal Yadav in SP, while Deepak Singh, a supporter of Poonia, was preparing for the election for a long time
 yadav ko tikat dene ke peeche bhi benny kaa makasad dariyabad vidhansabha kshetra main yadav matadaataaon ko rakesh verma ke paksh main lamaband karnaa tha
 Similarly, in the Ramnagar assembly constituency, the old Congress leaders kept staring and got Ramvir Singh who came from the SP
 vahiin kursi vidhansabha kshetra par punia ne do varsh pehle hi ejeeniyar adarsh patel kii ummidavaari ghoshit kar di thi lekin yahaan bhi benny kii hi chali or tikat mila sapa se congress main aae nizamuddin ko
 The ticket dissatisfaction was not limited to Barabanki, Gonda
 gussa baharich, lakhimpur, sitapur, balrampur, shravasti, faijabad or sultanpur jilon main bhi najar aayaa
 In most of the seats here, Beni's supporters have got tickets and two thirds of these have come to Congress from another party
 barabanki ke puraane congressi netaa shukla kehete hai ki benny ne jis tarah se duusari party ke logon ko congress kaa tikat dilaayaa he usase party kii sthiti kaaphi haasyaaspad ho gai he
 Rajnath Sharma, once a senior associate of Beni, says that the Steel Authority of India (SAIL) should spend its money where there are iron mines but most of the money is being spent in Daryabad
 rajnath ke mutabik akele dariyabad ilaake main solar liten, handpump lagane samet kai anya kaaryon main karodon ru
 Have been spent rajnath kehete hai, 'benny ne apni puri takat keval apane bete ko vidhansabha pahunchane main jhunk di he
 People of other areas are very angry with this, which may overwhelm the Congress in the elections
 'tamaam virodhiyon ke bich benny ke samarthak bhi hai
 State General Secretary Anil Dubey of Rashtriya Lok Dal, an ally of Congress, says that Beni Prasad Verma has done politics of farmers
 is tarah se unhone choudhary charan singh ke agenda ko hi aage badhaane kaa kaam kiya he
 His presence in the Congress will strengthen the alliance
 congress ke media chunaav abhiyaan samiti ke sadsy surendra rajput kehete hai ki benny ko keval pichhadon kaa netaa banaakar ham unhen keval choti hadon main nahin rakh sakate
 Beni's personality is much bigger than this and the Congress will benefit from this in the assembly elections
 benny kii rajnatik kadalathi ko majbootee dene ke peeche barabanki, gonda, baharich or aasapaas ke jilon kii kurmi birdari kaa hi haath he
 Beni's stature was increased in the Congress to attract these Kurmi votes
 uttar pradesh main satta sukh bhogane ke liye congress ne muslim-kurmi sameekaran kaa sahaara liya he
 The Congress has identified 105 seats of muslim-kurmi population with more than 50,000 population, on which Beni's choice was preferred in the selection of candidates
 vaise, 2006 main masauli dange main benny or unke bete kaa naam aane se musalamaanon, khaskar ansaariyon kaa ek varg unase khaasaa naaraaz he
 Shakira Khatoon, the victim of that riot, sent an open letter to Rahul against the Steel Minister last month and has not received any reply yet
 chunaav ke nateezon se congress ko is khamoshi kaa jawaab mil saktaa he
 It is also not that the inclination of Kurmi voters always remained towards Beni Prasad Verma
 samaajawaadee party se alag hone ke baad benny prasad verma ne 2007 kaa vidhansabha chunaav apni party samaajawaadee kranti dal se ayodhya se ladaa lekin apni jamaanat bhi na bachaa sake
 Senior Samajwadi Party leader and state spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary, who was once an associate of Beni, says that Beni has never been a leader of Kurmis
 inhone kabhi sangharsh nahin kiya or na hi apatkaal main ye jail gaye
 Rajendra Chaudhary says, "mulayam Singh Yadav only pushed Beni forward and now his politics is limited only on Mulayam's opposition
 'benny par tanj kasate hue bhaajapa ke rashtriya upaadhyaksh or chunaav abhiyaan samiti ke adhyaksh calraj mishra kehete hai, 'congress khud ko pradesh main sabase majboot dal hone kaa daawa kar rahi he lekin inke netaaon ko hi sabase zyada virodh kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 Rahul is claiming development in the state, but his minister is not letting the people of his constituency speak before him
 jab benny jaise str ke mantri honge to vah kaise vikaas karenge or rahul kaa vaada kaise puraa karenge
 'uttar Pradesh assembly elections are not only important for Rahul Gandhi but it is going to affect many decisions of the UPA government
 yahi nahin, chunaav ke baad pradesh main banane vaala rajnatik sameekaran bhi congress main benny kaa kad tay karegaa
 If SP and Congress came closer, Benny's cabinet ministry would also be at stake
 safalataa kaa shrey rahul ke sir jayega or vifaltaa ke liye benny doshi honge
 Benny, who has been stunned now, may be disappointed
 bahumat mere saath he: benny prasad vermis chunaav main kendriya ispaat mantri or congress ke varisht netaa benny prasad verma kii saakh daanv par lagi he
 Excerpts from his conversation with key correspondent Ashish Mishra: - Congress first pushed you forward to get the support of OBC voters and now Sam Pitroda has come

 There is only one face here and that is Rahul Gandhi
 - congress ke paas pichde varg ke logon ke liye kya he?congress pichde varg ke logon ke vikaas or unhen uchit pratinidhitiv dene kii baat karti he
 For these reasons, voters from backward classes are getting attracted towards Congress
 - aapke sansadeey kshetra gonda main rahul or sonia kii sabhaaon main aapke virodh kii vajah kya he?virodh hameshaa taqatvar kaa hi hota he
 Some people are getting angry after not getting tickets
 aise logon ko chinhit kar liya gaya he
 These people will have to apologize or else they will not be able to remain in the Congress
 - aapane apane chaheton ko duusari partiyon se congress main laakar unhen tikat dilaayaa
 Is there a reason for protest? When the old leaders of Congress could not win the party for a long time, then it was necessary to bring new people
 duusari partiyon se aae keval 30 fisadi logon ko hi tikat diya gaya he
 Some people of the party have suffered since my joining the Congress, but the majority is with me
 naaraaz logon ko manaane ke liye ek team bana di gai he
 Such people believe it or else leave the party

 In a conversation with a news channel, Shourie also said that the Food Security Bill will ruin the country's economy as it will have serious consequences

 aapke kai saathiyon ko dilli se lekar tamaam rajyon main kamishnar banane ke baad rajyapal se lekar saansad or aayogon ke sadsy banane kii chaah main girte dekha hoon
 Do not teach me any multiplication that political systems give you this reward in return for your skills and experience
 aap sab is vyavastha ke anusaar ho gaye hai jo darasal kisi ke anusaar nahin he
 You have all surrendered everywhere and now the condition is that you cannot even express your sorrow
 garmi he isliye pataa bhi nahin chalata hoga ki vardi paseene se bhigi yaa dost ke gam ke ansu se
 Do not teach me lessons of duty and devotion
 is nishtha kaa peda banaakar aapke bich ke do chaar afasar kha rahe hai or baaki log khaane ke maukey kii talash kar rahe hai
 From minor incidents to the false accusations of terrorism in the name of terrorism, the stories of the youth reveal that the ruins of the Indian Police Service are now collapsing
 dangon se lekar balvon main yaa to aap chup rahe, jaanch adhuri kii or kisi ko bhi fasaa diya
 You must have seen how many ips went to jail in Gujarat
 ek to jail se baahar aakar nrity kar rahaa tha
 The scene was telling that the Iqbal of the Indian Police Service has collapsed
 bhartiya police seva kii wo tasviir frem karakar apane apane rajyon ke aficers mess main laga dijiye
 There is also joy in the fall
 us tasviir ko dekh aapako kabhi kabhi anand bhi aayega
 i had read about Ribeiro Saheb and since then i have been reading about him and his writings
 baaki bhi likhane vaale aae lekin wo aapke naam par likhte likhte uski qeemat vasuulne lage
 Some people have run a shop in the name of police reform
 is intazaar main ki kab koi pad milegaa
 Shall i take the name? In the middle elections in a state, i was stunned to hear the story of caste and religious allegiance of the people among you
 bataaun kya? kya aapako pataa nahin? abhi hi dekhiye kuch ritair log mukul kii maut ke bahaane police sudhaar kaa sawaal uthaate uthaate setting main lag gaye hai
 As if he was in a job himself, he improved a lot
 aapaki simaayen samajhataa hoon
 i also know that you have some wonderful people among you
 kuch ke bich adarshavaad ab bhi bachaa he
 i am just writing these letters for those types and also for those who will become routine after reading
 in bache khuche adarsh or saamaan se ek nai imaarat bana lijiye or phir se ek lok vibhaag baniye jisaki pahchaan bas itani ho ki koi peshewar or nishapksh hone par sawaal na uthaa sake
 Regain your lost land
 akele bolne main dar lagata he to ek duusare kaa haath pakad kar boliye
 For this it is necessary that you first ask the District Magistrate of Mathura and the SSP in friendship with you, why did they come there
 kiske kehane par ham aise sanakee logon ko do se do hazaar hone diye
 They kept collecting weapons and why we kept quiet
 kya mukul vyavastha or raajnneeti ke kisi khataranaak mansoobon ke kaaran maaraa gaya? kya kal hamamen se bhi koi maaraa ja saktaa he? mukul kyon maaraa gaya? kuch jawaab unke honton par dekhiye or kuch unki aankhon main dhundhiye
 Is this death the result of your failure? Ask the District Magistrate of Mathura, SSP, whenever you meet, from Officer Mess to Hazratganj ice cream parlor
 khud se bhi poochhate rahiye
 Find out how far the strings of this event go
 nazar daudaiye ki aisi kitni sambhavit ghatnaon ke taar yahan vahaan bikhare hai
 Get back the land of a poor person who is troubled by political occupation
 santosh yadav or mukul dvivedi ke ghar jaaiye
 Face their families and say that we have become so accustomed to playing a veil on the agreements of past, present and future governments, from the Honor to the orderly, that we should all be considered dead
 ham sabko jite ji muawza mil janaa chahie
 Get out of the helplessness of saying no, sir
 ritair log ke bharose mat rahiye
 Make a place for speaking
 aapaki naukari hamaari tarah nahin he ki do minute main chalata kar diye gaye
 Many of us still speak a lot for everyone
 aap sarkaron ke ishaaron par hamaare kilaaf epa ai aar karte hai phir bhi ham bol dete hai
 Gujarat files of Rana Job not of Mangai
 aap kam se kam bhartiya police seva ke bhartiya hone kaa farj to adaa karen
 You are acting at the behest of governments everywhere
 kabhi kabhi apane zamir kaa ishaara bhi dekh lijiye
 Do not pay such a big price in exchange for transfer and promotion
 ham sahi main kuch rajyon ke rajyapalon kaa naam nahin jaanate hai
 The names of the members of some commissions are not known
 in padon ke liye chup mat rahiye
 Fight while in service
 boliye
 Speak against these agreements
 apane mahakme kii saakh ke liye boliye ki mathura main kya hua, kyon hua
 Talk about on what basis people are divided among you
 diary hi likhiye ki aapke bich kaa koi eemaandaaree se lard rahaa tha to aap sab chup the 
 You left it alone bhartiya prashasnic seva ho yaa police seva sabaki yahi kahani he
 The comments varanaa ek din kisi park main jab aap ruler lekar walk kar rahe honge or kahin mukul dvivedi takaraa gaye to aap unka saamana kaise karenge ? yaar hamane tumhaari maut ke baad bhi jaisaa chal rahaa tha vaisaa hi chalane diya
 Will they answer Did we dream of becoming a policeman for this day, that we will all get involved in our jugaad? main maaraa jaaounga or tum jite jite ji mar jaaoge
 Somewhere Mukul said this! aap sabhi kii kairiyat chaahane vaala magar iske badale rajyapal yaa saansad banane kii chaah na rakhane vaala raveesh kumaar is patr kaa lekhak hai
 The postman has gone to fetch Ganga water, so i am posting it on my blog town
 amin ! Hopefully, some part of the silence of Mukul Dwivedi's death will also be spread around all of you
 unki yaaden rah rahakar aa ja rahi hongi
 Some old thing must be missing, something must be missing
 training ke samay academy kii chotii se hyderabad dekhnaa yaad aa rahaa hoga
 After seeing Mathura, one must remember the hospitality there
 kuch adarsh yaad aate honge
 Must have missed a lot of compromises
 main yah patr isliye nahin likh rahaa ki ek ai pi es adhikari mukul dvivedi kii maut hui he
 i am equally saddened by the death of Sub Inspector Santosh Yadav
 utana hi dukh jioul haq kii hatya par hua tha
 Equally sad was when IPS Narendra Kumar was crushed by the mining mafia in Madhya Pradesh
 darasal kehane ke liye kuch khaas he nahin lekin aapaki chuppi ke kaaran likhnaa pad rahaa he
 The silence of Gharat and Zameer bothers me
 isi vajah se likh rahaa hoon ki aap logon ko apane maatahaton kii maut par chup hote to dekha he magar yaqiin nahin ho rahaa he ki aap apane varisht, samakaksh yaa kanishtha kii maut par bhi chup rah jaayenge
 i just want to feel what you guys are thinking right now
 kya vahi soch rahe hai jo main soch rahaa hoon ? kya kuch aisa soch rahe hai jisase aapke sochane se kuch ho yaa aisa soch rahe hai ki kya kiya ja saktaa he
 Whatever is going on will go on
 main yah isliye puch rahaa hoon ki aapke saathi mukul dvivedi kaa muskuraataa cheharaa mujhe pareshaan kar rahaa he
 i did not know them at all
 kabhi mila bhi nahin
 But listening to his friends, he wants to ask what the people of his department think
 maine kabhi upiessi kii pariksha nahin di
 Was not a very good student so there was no confusion
 jab padhanaa samaj main aayaa tab tak main jivan main ratane kii aadat se tang aa gaya tha
 GS had no patience to rote that thick book
 iskaa matlab ye nahin ki lok jivan main locasevak kii bhoomika ko kabhi kam samajha ho
 Your work is very important and even today millions of people see the dream of reaching that point
 darasal khwaabon kaa taalluq avasaron kii uplabdhta se hota he
 The soldiers of our country, who have never been proud of me, spend their time in getting numbers and dreaming of meeting
 baaki hissaa wo is khwaab ko dekhne kii qeemat vasuulne main khapa detii hai
 From what we call dowry to bribery and political loyalty
 main is vakt aap logon ke bich apvadswarup afasaron kii baat nahin kar rahaa hum
 i am talking about that department which has been falling in every state full of years
 jo khandhar ho chukaa he
 In the ruins, i am talking of beautiful young men dressed in uniforms and law and old officers wearing uniforms, whose roses are spread on the pages of newspapers in reception as soon as they are posted in the district
 jinke ipies banane par ham log unke gaanv gharon tak camera lekar jate hai
 Perhaps the dream of doing something for the common people is left, which would have made your success a success of the people
 isliye ham har saal aapke aadarshon ko ricard karte hai
 Every year you also see those ideals beating you
 kya aap bhartiya police seva naam ke khandhar ko dekh paa rahe hai? kya aapaki vardi kabhi khandhar kii deevaaron se chipki safed papadiyon se takaraati he? rang jaati he? aapke bich behatar,nishpaksh or tatpar police banane ke khwaab mar gaye hai
 Therefore, you do not see the color of the walls of the depressed offices of SSP
 mujhe aapke khwaabon ko maarane vaale kaa naam pataa he magar main marane or maare jane waalon se poochna chahta hoon
 i have seen many of your colleagues from Delhi, after becoming commissioners in all the states, falling from the Governor to the mps and the desire to become members of Commissions
 mujhe koi pahaada na padhaaye ki raajnneetik vyavasthaayen aapako ye inaam aapke hunar or anubhav ke badale detii hai
 You all have become according to this system which is not according to anyone
 aap sabane har jagah samarpan kiya he or ab haalat ye ho gai ki aap apane gam kaa bhi izhaar nahin kar sakate
 It is summer, so it will not be known whether the uniform is wet with sweat or tears of friend's sorrow
 mujhe katarvy nishtha or parayanata kaa paath mat padhaaiye
 By making the peda of this loyalty, two or four officers among you are eating and the rest are looking for a chance to eat
 maamuli ghatnaon se lekar aatankwaad ke naam par jhuthe aaropon main phasaaye gaye naujavaanon ke kisse bataate hai ki bhartiya police seva ke khandhar ab dhahne lage hai
 From the riots to the rebellion, either you remained silent, made the inquiry incomplete and trapped anyone
 aapane dekha hoga ki gujarat main kitne ai pi es jail gaye
 One came out of jail and was dancing
 wo drishy bataa rahaa tha ki bhartiya police seva kaa iqbaal dhwast ho chukaa he
 Put that picture frame of the Indian Police Service and put it in the officers' mess of your states
 patan main bhi anand hota he
 You will sometimes enjoy seeing that picture
 ribero sahab ke bare main padhaa tha tab se unheen ke bare main or unka hi likhaa pard rahaa hoon
 The rest of the writers came but they started writing in your name and started charging for it
 police sudhaar ke naam par kuch logon ne dukaan chalaa rakhi he
 Awaiting when a position will be found
 main naam luun kya ? ek rajya main bich chunaavon main aapke bich ke logon kii jatigat or dharmik nishthaaon kii kahani sun kar sann rah gaya tha
 Should i tell? Don't you know See now, some retirees have started setting up raising questions of police reform on the pretext of Mukul's death
 khud jaise naukari main the to bahut sudhaar kar gaye 
 i understand your limitations yah bhi jaanata hoon ki aapke bich kuch shandaar log hai
 Idealism is still left among some
 bas ye patr unheen jaison ke liye likh rahaa hoon or un jaison ke liye bhi jo pard kar routine ho jaayenge
 Build a new building with these remaining ideals and stuff and then become a public department, whose identity is enough that no one can question being professional and unbiased
 apni khoi hui zamin ko hasil kijiye
 If you are afraid to speak alone, then speak with one hand
 iske liye jaruri he ki aap pehle mathura ke ziladhikari or es es pi se yaari dosti main hi puch lijiye ki aakhir vahaan ye naubat kyon ai
 On whose orders, we let such crazy people be two to two thousand
 ve hathiyaar jamaa karte rahe or ham kyon chup rahe
 Was Mukul killed due to any dangerous plans and system? Can any of us be killed tomorrow? Why was Mukul killed? Look for some answers on their lips and find some in their eyes
 kya ye maut aap sabaki naakaami kaa parinaam he? mathura ke ziladhikari, es es pi jab bhi mili, jahaan bhi mili, aafisar mess se lekar hazaratganj ke icecream parlor tak, puuchhiye
 Keep asking yourself too
 pataa kijiye ki is ghatana ke taar kahan tak jate hai
 Take a look at how many such possible incidents are scattered here and there
 raajnneetik qabzon se pareshaan kisi garib kii zamin waapas dilaaiye
 Go to the house of Santosh Yadav and Mukul Dwivedi
 unke pariwaron kaa saamana kijiye or kahiye ki darasal sahab se lekar ardli tak ham ateet, vartmaan or bhavi sarkaron ke samjhauton par pardaa daalane ke khel main itane abhyast ho gaye hai ki ham sabhi ko mara hua maan liya janaa chahie
 We all should get compensation while we live
 nahin kehane kii laachaari se nikliye sahab log
 Do not trust the retirees
 bolne kii jagah banaaiye
 Your job is not like ours, it was done in two minutes
 hamamen se kai phir bhi bahut kuch sabake liye bol dete hai
 You do an FIR against us at the behest of the governments, yet we speak
 rana ayyub kii gujarat files mangaai kii nahin
 You should at least pay the Indian Police Service to be Indian
 aap har jagah sarkaron ke ishaaron par kaam kar rahe hai
 Sometimes see the gesture of your conscience
 tabadalaa or padonnati ke badale itani badi qeemat mat chukaayiye
 We do not know the names of the governors of some states
 kuch aayogon ke sadasyon kaa naam nahin jaanate hai
 Do not be silent for these posts
 seva main rahete hue ladiye
 Say it in samjhauton ke kilaaf boliye
 For the credibility of your department, say what happened in Mathura, why it happened
 baat kijiye ki aapke bich log kis kis aadhaar par bant gaye hai
 Write a diary that if someone among you was fighting honestly, then you were all silent
 aapane akelaa chhod diya
 This is the story of everyone, be it Indian Administrative Service or Police Service
 tippaniyan Otherwise, one day when you are walking in a park with a ruler and somewhere Mukul Dwivedi collides, how will you face them? Dude, we allowed you to walk the same way after your death
 kya ye jawaab denge? kya yaar hamane isi din ke liye police banane kaa sapana dekha tha ki ham sab apane apane jugad main lag jaayenge
 i will be killed and you will die while living
 kahin mukul ne ye kah diya to ! Ravish Kumar, who wants the benefit of all of you but does not want to become Governor or MP in its place, is the author of this paper
 daakiya gangaajal laane gaya he isliye main ise apane blog kasbaa par post kar rahaa hoon

 Amen ! main bas mahasoos karnaa chahta hoon ki aap log is vakt kya soch rahe hai
 Are you thinking what I'm thinking? Are you thinking of something that may be doing something to your thinking or thinking about what can be done? jo chal rahaa he chalata rahegaa
 i am asking this because the smiling face of your partner Mukul Dwivedi is bothering me
 main unhen bilkul nahin jaanata tha
 Never even got lekin apane doston se unki tarif sunakar poochne kaa man kar rahaa he ki unke vibhaag ke log kya sochate hai
 i never took UPSC exam
 bahut acha vidhyaarthee nahin tha isliye kisi prakaar kaa bhram bhi nahin tha
 By the time i understood reading, i was fed up with the habit of rote life
 jies kii us moti kitaab ko ratane kaa dhiraj nahin bachaa tha
 This does not mean that the role of public servant in public life is ever underestimated
 aapkaa kaam bahut ahm he or aaj bhi lakhon log us muqaam par pahunchne kaa khwaab dekhte hai
 Actually dreams come from the availability of opportunities
 hamaare desh kii javaaniyaan,jis par mujhe kabhi naaz nahin rahaa,number laane or mulaazamat ke sapane dekhne main hi khap jaati hai
 She spends the rest of the price to see this dream
 jise ham dahez se lekar rishwat or raajnneetik nishtha kya kya nahin kehete hai
 i am not talking about you exceptions officers at this time
 us vibhaag kii baat kar rahaa hoon jo har rajya main varshon se bharbhara kar girtaa ja rahaa he
 Which has been ruins
 main un khandhiron main vardi or kanoon se las khubasurat noujvaan or vardi pahante hi vruddh ho chuke afasaron kii baat kar rahaa hoon jinaki zile main posting hote hi swaagat main akhbaaron ke pannon par gulab ke phool bikher diye jate hai
 After whose IPS, we take cameras to their villages
 shaayad aam logon ke liye kuch kar dene kaa khawaab kahin bachaa rah gaya he jo aapaki safalataa ko logon kii safalataa bana detaa hoga
 Therefore, we record your ideals every year
 har saal aapako apane un aadarshon ko maarthe hue bhi dekhte hai
 Can you see the ruins named Indian Police Service? Does your uniform ever hit white crusts sticking to the ruins walls? Does the color go away? The dreams of becoming a better, fair and ready police among you are dead
 isliye aapako es es pi ke udhaas daftaron kii deevaaron kaa rang nahin dikhataa
 i know the name of the person who killed your dreams, but i want to ask those who died and were killed
 aapke kai saathiyon ko dilli se lekar tamaam rajyon main kamishnar banane ke baad rajyapal se lekar saansad or aayogon ke sadsy banane kii chaah main girte dekha hoon
 Do not teach me any multiplication that political systems give you this reward in return for your skills and experience
 aap sab is vyavastha ke anusaar ho gaye hai jo darasal kisi ke anusaar nahin he
 You have all surrendered everywhere and now the condition is that you cannot even express your sorrow
 garmi he isliye pataa bhi nahin chalata hoga ki vardi paseene se bhigi yaa dost ke gam ke ansu se
 Do not teach me lessons of duty and devotion
 is nishtha kaa peda banaakar aapke bich ke do chaar afasar kha rahe hai or baaki log khaane ke maukey kii talash kar rahe hai
 From minor incidents to the false accusations of terrorism in the name of terrorism, the stories of the youth reveal that the ruins of the Indian Police Service are now collapsing
 dangon se lekar balvon main yaa to aap chup rahe, jaanch adhuri kii or kisi ko bhi fasaa diya
 You must have seen how many ips went to jail in Gujarat
 ek to jail se baahar aakar nrity kar rahaa tha
 The scene was telling that the Iqbal of the Indian Police Service has collapsed
 bhartiya police seva kii wo tasviir frem karakar apane apane rajyon ke aficers mess main laga dijiye
 There is also joy in the fall
 us tasviir ko dekh aapako kabhi kabhi anand bhi aayega
 i had read about Ribeiro Saheb and since then i have been reading about him and his writings
 baaki bhi likhane vaale aae lekin wo aapke naam par likhte likhte uski qeemat vasuulne lage
 Some people have run a shop in the name of police reform
 is intazaar main ki kab koi pad milegaa
 Shall i take the name? In the middle elections in a state, i was stunned to hear the story of caste and religious allegiance of the people among you
 bataaun kya? kya aapako pataa nahin? abhi hi dekhiye kuch ritair log mukul kii maut ke bahaane police sudhaar kaa sawaal uthaate uthaate setting main lag gaye hai
 As if he was in a job himself, he improved a lot
 aapaki simaayen samajhataa hoon
 i also know that you have some wonderful people among you
 kuch ke bich adarshavaad ab bhi bachaa he
 i am just writing these letters for those types and also for those who will become routine after reading
 in bache khuche adarsh or saamaan se ek nai imaarat bana lijiye or phir se ek lok vibhaag baniye jisaki pahchaan bas itani ho ki koi peshewar or nishapksh hone par sawaal na uthaa sake
 Regain your lost land
 akele bolne main dar lagata he to ek duusare kaa haath pakad kar boliye
 For this it is necessary that you first ask the District Magistrate of Mathura and the SSP in friendship with you, why did they come there
 kiske kehane par ham aise sanakee logon ko do se do hazaar hone diye
 They kept collecting weapons and why we kept quiet
 kya mukul vyavastha or raajnneeti ke kisi khataranaak mansoobon ke kaaran maaraa gaya? kya kal hamamen se bhi koi maaraa ja saktaa he? mukul kyon maaraa gaya? kuch jawaab unke honton par dekhiye or kuch unki aankhon main dhundhiye
 Is this death the result of your failure? Ask the District Magistrate of Mathura, SSP, whenever you meet, from Officer Mess to Hazratganj ice cream parlor
 khud se bhi poochhate rahiye
 Find out how far the strings of this event go
 nazar daudaiye ki aisi kitni sambhavit ghatnaon ke taar yahan vahaan bikhare hai
 Get back the land of a poor person who is troubled by political occupation
 santosh yadav or mukul dvivedi ke ghar jaaiye
 Face their families and say that we have become so accustomed to playing a veil on the agreements of past, present and future governments, from the Honor to the orderly, that we should all be considered dead
 ham sabko jite ji muawza mil janaa chahie
 Get out of the helplessness of saying no, sir
 ritair log ke bharose mat rahiye
 Make a place for speaking
 aapaki naukari hamaari tarah nahin he ki do minute main chalata kar diye gaye
 Many of us still speak a lot for everyone
 aap sarkaron ke ishaaron par hamaare kilaaf epa ai aar karte hai phir bhi ham bol dete hai

 aap kam se kam bhartiya police seva ke bhartiya hone kaa farj to adaa karen
 You are acting at the behest of governments everywhere
 kabhi kabhi apane zamir kaa ishaara bhi dekh lijiye
 Do not pay such a big price in exchange for transfer and promotion
 ham sahi main kuch rajyon ke rajyapalon kaa naam nahin jaanate hai
 The names of the members of some commissions are not known
 in padon ke liye chup mat rahiye
 Fight while in service
 boliye
 Speak against these agreements
 apane mahakme kii saakh ke liye boliye ki mathura main kya hua, kyon hua
 Talk about on what basis people are divided among you
 diary hi likhiye ki aapke bich kaa koi eemaandaaree se lard rahaa tha to aap sab chup the 
 You left it alone bhartiya prashasnic seva ho yaa police seva sabaki yahi kahani he
 The comments varanaa ek din kisi park main jab aap ruler lekar walk kar rahe honge or kahin mukul dvivedi takaraa gaye to aap unka saamana kaise karenge ? yaar hamane tumhaari maut ke baad bhi jaisaa chal rahaa tha vaisaa hi chalane diya
 Will they answer Did we dream of becoming a policeman for this day, that we will all get involved in our jugaad? main maaraa jaaounga or tum jite jite ji mar jaaoge
 Somewhere Mukul said this! aap sabhi kii kairiyat chaahane vaala magar iske badale rajyapal yaa saansad banane kii chaah na rakhane vaala raveesh kumaar is patr kaa lekhak hai
 The postman has gone to fetch Ganga water, so i am posting it on my blog town
 amin ! i never took UPSC exam
 bahut acha vidhyaarthee nahin tha isliye kisi prakaar kaa bhram bhi nahin tha
 By the time i understood reading, i was fed up with the habit of rote life
 jies kii us moti kitaab ko ratane kaa dhiraj nahin bachaa tha
 This does not mean that the role of public servant in public life is ever underestimated
 aapkaa kaam bahut ahm he or aaj bhi lakhon log us muqaam par pahunchne kaa khwaab dekhte hai
 Actually dreams come from the availability of opportunities
 hamaare desh kii javaaniyaan,jis par mujhe kabhi naaz nahin rahaa,number laane or mulaazamat ke sapane dekhne main hi khap jaati hai
 She spends the rest of the price to see this dream
 jise ham dahez se lekar rishwat or raajnneetik nishtha kya kya nahin kehete hai
 i am not talking about you exceptions officers at this time
 us vibhaag kii baat kar rahaa hoon jo har rajya main varshon se bharbhara kar girtaa ja rahaa he
 Which has been ruins
 main un khandhiron main vardi or kanoon se las khubasurat noujvaan or vardi pahante hi vruddh ho chuke afasaron kii baat kar rahaa hoon jinaki zile main posting hote hi swaagat main akhbaaron ke pannon par gulab ke phool bikher diye jate hai
 After whose IPS, we take cameras to their villages
 shaayad aam logon ke liye kuch kar dene kaa khawaab kahin bachaa rah gaya he jo aapaki safalataa ko logon kii safalataa bana detaa hoga
 Therefore, we record your ideals every year
 har saal aapako apane un aadarshon ko maarthe hue bhi dekhte hai
 Can you see the ruins named Indian Police Service? Does your uniform ever hit white crusts sticking to the ruins walls? Does the color go away? The dreams of becoming a better, fair and ready police among you are dead
 isliye aapako es es pi ke udhaas daftaron kii deevaaron kaa rang nahin dikhataa
 i know the name of the person who killed your dreams, but i want to ask those who died and were killed
 aapke kai saathiyon ko dilli se lekar tamaam rajyon main kamishnar banane ke baad rajyapal se lekar saansad or aayogon ke sadsy banane kii chaah main girte dekha hoon
 Do not teach me any multiplication that political systems give you this reward in return for your skills and experience
 aap sab is vyavastha ke anusaar ho gaye hai jo darasal kisi ke anusaar nahin he
 You have all surrendered everywhere and now the condition is that you cannot even express your sorrow
 garmi he isliye pataa bhi nahin chalata hoga ki vardi paseene se bhigi yaa dost ke gam ke ansu se
 Do not teach me lessons of duty and devotion
 is nishtha kaa peda banaakar aapke bich ke do chaar afasar kha rahe hai or baaki log khaane ke maukey kii talash kar rahe hai
 From minor incidents to the false accusations of terrorism in the name of terrorism, the stories of the youth reveal that the ruins of the Indian Police Service are now collapsing
 dangon se lekar balvon main yaa to aap chup rahe, jaanch adhuri kii or kisi ko bhi fasaa diya
 You must have seen how many ips went to jail in Gujarat
 ek to jail se baahar aakar nrity kar rahaa tha
 The scene was telling that the Iqbal of the Indian Police Service has collapsed
 bhartiya police seva kii wo tasviir frem karakar apane apane rajyon ke aficers mess main laga dijiye
 There is also joy in the fall
 us tasviir ko dekh aapako kabhi kabhi anand bhi aayega
 i had read about Ribeiro Saheb and since then i have been reading about him and his writings
 baaki bhi likhane vaale aae lekin wo aapke naam par likhte likhte uski qeemat vasuulne lage
 Some people have run a shop in the name of police reform
 is intazaar main ki kab koi pad milegaa
 Shall i take the name? In the middle elections in a state, i was stunned to hear the story of caste and religious allegiance of the people among you
 bataaun kya? kya aapako pataa nahin? abhi hi dekhiye kuch ritair log mukul kii maut ke bahaane police sudhaar kaa sawaal uthaate uthaate setting main lag gaye hai
 As if he was in a job himself, he improved a lot
 aapaki simaayen samajhataa hoon
 i also know that you have some wonderful people among you
 kuch ke bich adarshavaad ab bhi bachaa he
 i am just writing these letters for those types and also for those who will become routine after reading
 in bache khuche adarsh or saamaan se ek nai imaarat bana lijiye or phir se ek lok vibhaag baniye jisaki pahchaan bas itani ho ki koi peshewar or nishapksh hone par sawaal na uthaa sake
 Regain your lost land
 akele bolne main dar lagata he to ek duusare kaa haath pakad kar boliye
 For this it is necessary that you first ask the District Magistrate of Mathura and the SSP in friendship with you, why did they come there
 kiske kehane par ham aise sanakee logon ko do se do hazaar hone diye
 They kept collecting weapons and why we kept quiet
 kya mukul vyavastha or raajnneeti ke kisi khataranaak mansoobon ke kaaran maaraa gaya? kya kal hamamen se bhi koi maaraa ja saktaa he? mukul kyon maaraa gaya? kuch jawaab unke honton par dekhiye or kuch unki aankhon main dhundhiye
 Is this death the result of your failure? Ask the District Magistrate of Mathura, SSP, whenever you meet, from Officer Mess to Hazratganj ice cream parlor
 khud se bhi poochhate rahiye
 Find out how far the strings of this event go
 nazar daudaiye ki aisi kitni sambhavit ghatnaon ke taar yahan vahaan bikhare hai
 Get back the land of a poor person who is troubled by political occupation
 santosh yadav or mukul dvivedi ke ghar jaaiye
 Face their families and say that we have become so accustomed to playing a veil on the agreements of past, present and future governments, from the Honor to the orderly, that we should all be considered dead
 ham sabko jite ji muawza mil janaa chahie
 Get out of the helplessness of saying no, sir
 ritair log ke bharose mat rahiye
 Make a place for speaking
 aapaki naukari hamaari tarah nahin he ki do minute main chalata kar diye gaye
 Many of us still speak a lot for everyone
 aap sarkaron ke ishaaron par hamaare kilaaf epa ai aar karte hai phir bhi ham bol dete hai
