vahaan jaanch main wo dengue positive paaya gaya
 After this Aman was admitted to Safdarjung Hospital
 parivaar kaa aarope he ki safadarajang ne dengue kii pushti hone par bhi sirf dawa likhakar ghar le jane ko kah diya
 But as health worsened, Aman was admitted to Jeevan Hospital
 vahaan teen din bhartee rahane ke baad aspataal ne uchit ilaaj main asamarthta jataai
 Her parents then spoke at Moolchand Hospital, Batra Hospital and Max Hospital
 in sabhi aspataalon ne bed kii kami kii vajah se bhartee karne se inkaar kar diya
 Aman was then admitted to Holy Family Hospital, where he died after nearly 12 hours of treatment
 guuruuvaar se lekar ravivaar ke bich parivaar is aspataal se us aspataal tak bhaagta hi rahaa
 If you could count then i have named seven hospitals in this news
 ek zimmedaar naagarik samaaj kaa farz banataa he ki ghatana ke kaarnon ko thik thik jane
 Maybe there are some other causes of death and there is some other side as well, but if you have to go round seven hospitals with a child, then understand that rather understand, fear not
 dariye ki aapke saath aisa ho gaya to
 The hospitals whose names are heard from Aman's parents are as follows
 - aspataal number ek he godarez aspataal shrinivasapuri, jahaan dengue kii pushti hui
 The hospital said take Aman to a big hospital where there are treatment facilities
 - aspataal number do he safadarajang aspataal
 - Hospital number three Jeevan Hospital where Aman's condition worsens and the hospital says that he is incapable
 - aspataal number chaar moolchand aspataal jisase maa baap ne sampark kiya, magar bed nahin mila
 - Hospital number five Batra Hospital, which parents also contacted for recruitment
 - aspataal number chah maiks aspataal jisase bhi sampark kiya lekin bed kii kami bataai gai
 - Hospital number seven Holi family where admitted, it was late and Aman lost his life

 But you remember what our news channels were doing for the last few weeks
 ek hi netaa kii raily ko din main do baar dikhaa rahe the
 Lalu Yadav's channel-by-channel interview was going on
 ek bhi seat na jeetne vaale ovaisi ko bihar chunaav ke bahaane bijepi ke baraabar kawarez diya ja rahaa tha
 Radhe Maa and Indrani Mukherjee were playing with news in prime time
 ek channel par radhe maa kii samarthika or ek lalaranga mahatma ke bich live thappad chale to kai channelon ne footage manga liye
 It is called playing in the world language of our channels
 channelon ne is footage ko lekar khub khelaa
 You also played audience with him
 ab aap aman or avinaash kii maut ke baad kisi bhi channel ke ankar kii bhashaa dekhiye
 It would seem that to avenge Aman and Avinash's death, they have taken off in the same way as they were taking the lead to liberate you from the love trap of Radhe Maa
 hamaari duniya ke log aapke bare main bataate hai ki aap log ghar laut kar kuch intertaning dekhnaa chaahate hai
 i myself am involved in this criticism
 aadhi duniya dengue failaane vaale machharon kii giraft main he
 Latin American countries like Argentina, Mexico, Chile and Asian countries like India Pakistan
 machhar ke kaatane par uski laar main maujuud dengue ke virus insaan ke jism main chale jate hai
 The dengue virus in the body infects the immune cells present in the skin, ie immune cells
 iske baad virus sharir ke ahm limphatic system main pravesh kar jaataa he is dauraan virus se sankramit mariz ko tej bukhaar aata he
 It has a local effect in the initial phase ie the incubation period
 phir ye khun kii nalikaaon se hokar mariz ke puure sharir main fail jaataa he ise veremia kehete hai
 Some patients and especially children have very high fever at times
 jise dengue hemoragic (hemorrhagic) fever kehete hai
 It starts to leak from blood vessels and leaks plasma
 agar machhar kisi dengue ke marij ko katata he to uske khun main maujuud virus apane saath lekar duusare swasth logon main failaane kaa kaam karata he
 There has been a dengue panic in Delhi since 1996
 dengue ko lekar jo karnaa chahie use lekar bahes hone lagi he, honi chahie kyonki agar ham ye kar pate to itane logon ko degun nahin hota
 Another aspect of this debate is the capacity, responsibility and accountability of hospitals
 aap kisi bhi bahes ko dekhiye

 So far 3365 notices have been sent to government buildings
 raashtrapati bhawan ko saal bhar main 90 notice bheje ja chuke hai
 Mosquitoes have been found to thrive in the coolers there
 ames ko bhi 22 notice bheje gaye hai
 There have been 9 invoices
 safadarajang ko bhi 12 notice bheje gaye hai
 When notices are being given to hospitals, then understand what will happen to other places
 jab koi kaam kar rahaa tha tab bhi kisi ko kuch fark nahin pad rahaa tha
 This is what is shown by invoices and notices

 Looking at it carefully, we came to know that MCD has such a pencil which glows in the same way as written in January
 laga ki kisi ne ek hi baar main nau maheene ke kaam kaa hisaab likh diya he
 Seeing the same type of signature, there was a fellow who fogged here for nine months and signed on the wall
 iske kaam se prabhavit hokar pacil kii likhaawat ne bhi mitane se inkaar kar diya he
 Just did not show people that fogging occurred before death and suicide
 lipapoti ke naam par nae poster laga die gaye or lage ki safai ke prati kitni satarkta he
 The villagers told that as soon as the news of Avinash's death was published, toilets started coming out of the village
 system main itnaa power he ki 24 ghante main shahar basaakar sabit kar de ki yahaan sadiyon se ek shahar tha
 So far 1872 cases of dengue have been reported in Delhi

 - Hospital number one is Godrez Hospital Srinivaspuri, where dengue has been confirmed
 aspataal ne kaha aman ko kisi bade aspataal main le jaao jahaan ilaaj kii suvidhaayen hon
 - Hospital number two is Safdarjung Hospital
 - aspataal number teen jivan aspataal jahaan aman kii haalat bigadati he or aspataal kahata he ki wo asamarth he
 - Hospital number four Moolchand Hospital with which parents contacted, but did not get beds
 - aspataal number paanch batra aspataal jisase bhi maa baap ne bhartee ke liye sampark kiya
 - Hospital number six Max Hospital whoever contacted but was told the lack of beds
 - aspataal number saat holi family jahaan bhartee hui, der ho gai or aman kii jaan chali gai
 Since when is dengue in Delhi lekin aap yaad kiijie to hamaare news channel pichley kuch hafton se kya kar rahe the
 They were showing the same leader's rally twice a day
 lalu yadav kaa channel dar channel intervyuu chal rahaa tha
 Owaisi, who did not win a single seat, was being given equal coverage to the BJP on the pretext of Bihar elections
 prime timon main radhe maa or indrani mukherjee kii khabar se khel rahe the
 On one channel, a live slap between Radhe Maa's Samarthika and a Lalaranga Mahatma went on, and many channels asked for footage
 hamaare channelon kii duniya kii bhashaa main ise khelnaa kehete hai
 The channels played a lot about this footage
 unke saath aap darshak bhi khele
 Now after the death of Aman and Avinash, see the language of the anchor of any channel
 lagegaa ki aman or avinaash kii maut kaa badla lene ke liye usee tarah se utaaru ho gaye hai jaise ve radhe maa ke moh jaal se aapako azaad karne kaa bidaa uthaae hue the
 People of our world tell about you that you want to return home and see some entertainment
 is aalochana main main khud bhi shaamil hum
 Half the world is in the grip of mosquitoes that spread dengue
 latin america desh jaise argentina, maxico, chile or asian desh jaise bharat pakistan
 After mosquito bite, the dengue virus present in its saliva goes into human body
 jism main pahunchaa dengue virus twachaa main maujuud pratirodhi koshikaayen yani immune cells ko sankramit karata he
 After this, the virus enters the vital lymphatic system of the body, during which the virus infected patient has high fever
 shuruaati daur yani incubation period main iskaa sthaneey asar hota he
 Then it spreads through the blood vessels throughout the patient's body, it is called Veremia
 kuch marizon or khaskar bacchon main kai baar bahut tej bukhaar ho jaataa he
 Which is called dengue hemorrhagic fever
 isamen khun kii naliyon se risaav shuru ho jaataa he or usase plasma kii licage shuru ho jaati he
 If a mosquito bites a dengue patient, then the virus present in its blood carries with it the function of spreading to other healthy people
 1996 se dilli main dengue kaa aatank he
 There has been a debate about what should be done about dengue, because if we could have done this, then not many people would have been deified
 is bahes kaa doosraa pahalu he aspataalon kii kshamta, zimmedaari or javabdehi kaa
 Look at any debate
 mul sawaal se bhatak kar emsidi banaam dilli sarkaar main badal gai he
 It should be the matter of the Astpals, the cost of hoarding being talked about
 baat safai kii honi chahie to baat ho rahi he ki koun hamase kharaab he
 Aman and Avinash would not have died if the MCD and the government and civil society had been aware
 kaam kar rahaa hota
 If everyone was doing their own work then Aman and Avinash would not have died
 kai baar sansthaaen kaam bhi karti hai to koi notice nahin letaa
 Now NDMC has challaned 193 buildings, including Rashtrapati Bhavan, on mosquito breeding
 sarkari imaaraton ko ab tak 3365 notice bheje hai
 90 notices have been sent to Rashtrapati Bhavan in a year
 vahaan ke culeron main machharon ko panpate paaya gaya he
 AIIMS has also sent 22 notices
 9 chaalaan hue hai
 12 notices have also been sent to Safdarjung
 jab aspataalon ko notice diye ja rahe hai to samajhiye ki baaki jagahon kaa kya hota hoga
 Even when one was working, no one was making any difference
 chaalaan or notice se yahi pataa chalata he
 Our system has another method
 jab kaam na karte hue pakade jaaen to aisa kuch kiya jaae jisase lage ki kaam kiya ja chukaa he
 The comments jab ham somvaar ko lado sarai gaye to vahaan kii diwaar par janvari se lekar sitambar tak kii taarikh likhi hui thi
 Fogging took place here on these dates
 gaur se dekha to pataa chalaa ki emsidi ke paas koi aisi pencil he jiskaa janvari main likhaa vaise hi chamakta he jaise sitambar kaa likhaa hua
 It seemed that someone had written the account of nine months of work at once
 ek hi tarah ke dastakhat dekh kar laga ki koi to banda he jo nau maheene se yahaan foging kar diwaar par sin karata he
 Impressed by its work, the handwriting of the pencil has also declined
 bas logon ko nahin dikhaa ki maut or khudakushi se pehle foging hui thi
 In the name of daub, new posters were put up and it seemed that there is a lot of caution about cleanliness
 gaanv waalon ne bataaya ki avinaash kii maut kii khabar chhapate hi gaanv ke baahar shauchalay banane laga
 There is so much power in the system that in 24 hours the city can prove that it was a city for centuries
 dilli main abhi tak dengue ke 1872 maamle aa chuke hai
 When such a big city does not have this small number of beds, or beds for 500 thousand patients, then imagine what would happen in the rest of the country
 dilli main dengue kab se he
 But you remember what our news channels were doing for the last few weeks
 ek hi netaa kii raily ko din main do baar dikhaa rahe the
 Lalu Yadav's channel-by-channel interview was going on
 ek bhi seat na jeetne vaale ovaisi ko bihar chunaav ke bahaane bijepi ke baraabar kawarez diya ja rahaa tha
 Radhe Maa and Indrani Mukherjee were playing with news in prime time
 ek channel par radhe maa kii samarthika or ek lalaranga mahatma ke bich live thappad chale to kai channelon ne footage manga liye
 It is called playing in the world language of our channels
 channelon ne is footage ko lekar khub khelaa
 You also played audience with him
 ab aap aman or avinaash kii maut ke baad kisi bhi channel ke ankar kii bhashaa dekhiye
 It would seem that to avenge Aman and Avinash's death, they have taken off in the same way as they were taking the lead to liberate you from the love trap of Radhe Maa
 hamaari duniya ke log aapke bare main bataate hai ki aap log ghar laut kar kuch intertaning dekhnaa chaahate hai
 i myself am involved in this criticism
 aadhi duniya dengue failaane vaale machharon kii giraft main he
 Latin American countries like Argentina, Mexico, Chile and Asian countries like India Pakistan
 machhar ke kaatane par uski laar main maujuud dengue ke virus insaan ke jism main chale jate hai
 The dengue virus in the body infects the immune cells present in the skin, ie immune cells
 iske baad virus sharir ke ahm limphatic system main pravesh kar jaataa he is dauraan virus se sankramit mariz ko tej bukhaar aata he
 It has a local effect in the initial phase ie the incubation period
 phir ye khun kii nalikaaon se hokar mariz ke puure sharir main fail jaataa he ise veremia kehete hai
 Some patients and especially children have very high fever at times
 jise dengue hemoragic (hemorrhagic) fever kehete hai
 It starts to leak from blood vessels and leaks plasma
 agar machhar kisi dengue ke marij ko katata he to uske khun main maujuud virus apane saath lekar duusare swasth logon main failaane kaa kaam karata he
 There has been a dengue panic in Delhi since 1996
 dengue ko lekar jo karnaa chahie use lekar bahes hone lagi he, honi chahie kyonki agar ham ye kar pate to itane logon ko degun nahin hota
 Another aspect of this debate is the capacity, responsibility and accountability of hospitals
 aap kisi bhi bahes ko dekhiye
 Wandering from the original question has changed to MCD v
 Government of Delhi
 baat astapaalon kii honi chahie, baat ho rahi hording ke kharche kii
 If it is to be clarified, then it is being said that who is worse than us
 aman or avinaash marate nahin agar emsidi or sarkaar or naagarik samaaj jaagruk hota
 Would have been working agar sab apana apana kaam kar hi rahe hote to aman or avinaash kii maut nahin hoti
 Sometimes even if the institutions work, no one takes notice

 raashtrapati bhawan ko saal bhar main 90 notice bheje ja chuke hai
 Mosquitoes have been found to thrive in the coolers there
 ames ko bhi 22 notice bheje gaye hai
 There have been 9 invoices
 safadarajang ko bhi 12 notice bheje gaye hai
 When notices are being given to hospitals, then understand what will happen to other places
 jab koi kaam kar rahaa tha tab bhi kisi ko kuch fark nahin pad rahaa tha
 This is what is shown by invoices and notices
 hamaare system ke paas ek or tarika he
 When you are caught not working, then do something that looks like work has been done
 tippaniyan When we went to Lado Sarai on Monday, there was a date written from January to September on the wall there
 in in taarikh ko yahaan foging hui
 Looking at it carefully, we came to know that MCD has such a pencil which glows in the same way as written in January
 laga ki kisi ne ek hi baar main nau maheene ke kaam kaa hisaab likh diya he
 Seeing the same type of signature, there was a fellow who fogged here for nine months and signed on the wall
 iske kaam se prabhavit hokar pacil kii likhaawat ne bhi mitane se inkaar kar diya he
 Just did not show people that fogging occurred before death and suicide
 lipapoti ke naam par nae poster laga die gaye or lage ki safai ke prati kitni satarkta he
 The villagers told that as soon as the news of Avinash's death was published, toilets started coming out of the village
 system main itnaa power he ki 24 ghante main shahar basaakar sabit kar de ki yahaan sadiyon se ek shahar tha
 So far 1872 cases of dengue have been reported in Delhi
 jab itane bade shahar main is choti si sankhya ke laayak bed nahin he, yaa paanch sau hazaar marizon ke liye bed nahin he to sochiye ki desh ke baaki hisson main kya hota hoga
 On one channel, a live slap between Radhe Maa's Samarthika and a Lalaranga Mahatma went on, and many channels asked for footage
 hamaare channelon kii duniya kii bhashaa main ise khelnaa kehete hai
 The channels played a lot about this footage
 unke saath aap darshak bhi khele
 Now after the death of Aman and Avinash, see the language of the anchor of any channel
 lagegaa ki aman or avinaash kii maut kaa badla lene ke liye usee tarah se utaaru ho gaye hai jaise ve radhe maa ke moh jaal se aapako azaad karne kaa bidaa uthaae hue the
 People of our world tell about you that you want to return home and see some entertainment
 is aalochana main main khud bhi shaamil hum
 Half the world is in the grip of mosquitoes that spread dengue
 latin america desh jaise argentina, maxico, chile or asian desh jaise bharat pakistan
 After mosquito bite, the dengue virus present in its saliva goes into human body
 jism main pahunchaa dengue virus twachaa main maujuud pratirodhi koshikaayen yani immune cells ko sankramit karata he
 After this, the virus enters the vital lymphatic system of the body, during which the virus infected patient has high fever
 shuruaati daur yani incubation period main iskaa sthaneey asar hota he
 Then it spreads through the blood vessels throughout the patient's body, it is called Veremia
 kuch marizon or khaskar bacchon main kai baar bahut tej bukhaar ho jaataa he
 Which is called dengue hemorrhagic fever
 isamen khun kii naliyon se risaav shuru ho jaataa he or usase plasma kii licage shuru ho jaati he
 If a mosquito bites a dengue patient, then the virus present in its blood carries with it the function of spreading to other healthy people
 1996 se dilli main dengue kaa aatank he
 There has been a debate about what should be done about dengue, because if we could have done this, then not many people would have been deified
 is bahes kaa doosraa pahalu he aspataalon kii kshamta, zimmedaari or javabdehi kaa
 Look at any debate
 mul sawaal se bhatak kar emsidi banaam dilli sarkaar main badal gai he
 It should be the matter of the Astpals, the cost of hoarding being talked about
 baat safai kii honi chahie to baat ho rahi he ki koun hamase kharaab he
 Aman and Avinash would not have died if the MCD and the government and civil society had been aware
 kaam kar rahaa hota
 If everyone was doing their own work then Aman and Avinash would not have died

 Also read: On the first day of Sahitya Aaj Tak, Vijay Trivedi, in a session organized by Hansraj Hans and Nizami Brothers, said that accepting a good thing is a sign of a powerful personality
 desh main aarthik riform kii shuruyaat bhale narsinha raav ne kiya lekin use aage badhaane kii takat purv piem atal bihari vaajapeyi ne dikhaai
 Vijay Trivedi said that during Vajpayee's tenure there came a time when the leadership of the Sangh should sit at his house and Vajpayee should leave the post of Prime Minister and become the President of the country
 trivedi ke mutabik is daur main vaajapeyi sangh se bade ho chuke the
 Uday Mahurkar said that along with his personality, the Sangh is also responsible for the way in which Prime Minister Modi's height has increased in the present times
 mahurkar ne kaha ki desh se garibi hataane kaa sabase kargar prayaas maujuuda pradhanmantri modi ne kiya he
 After all, during the three-year tenure of the Modi government, Robert Vadra was forgotten
 mahurkar ne kaha ki piem modi taqatvar hone ke saath-saath ek shaatir raajnneetijna bhi hai
 PM Modi knows that if he falls behind a Congress leader or a person of the Gandhi family, it can have the opposite consequences
 ise bhi padhein: sahitya ajtak ke duusare din jane maane kaviyon ne baandha samansanjay baru ne kaha desh main udaarvaad kii nitiyon ko 1991 ke baad badhaayaa gaya
 According to Baru, today when the country is being claimed that it is the second most important country in the world, all this was the result of Narasimha Rao's tenure
 aakhir kyon vaajapeyi ji gaiyr-congress vaad kaa naaraa buland nahin kar paae
 Vijay said that when Atal Bihari's 13-day government came to power again in 1998, the first glimpse of non-congressism was seen during his tenure
 vijay ne kaha ki itihaas main vaajapeyi doctrin kaa zikr hota he
 This is because Vajpayee as PM knew to keep connected with everyone
 vah jitna party ke andar bane khemon ke sampark main rahete hue sabase milte the vahiin vah vipaksh main bhi sabase milane or conect rakhane main vishwaas rakhte the
 This work cannot be done by PM Modi, so it can also be said that Atal ji was more powerful than the current PM Modi
 haalanki mahurkar ne kaha ki jis tarah se prashasan main piem modi ne transperency ke kshetra main kaam kiya he vah unhen desh kaa sabase taqatvar piem banane ke liye paryaapt he

 bharat main shiksha se jude masalon par pandrah saal se kaam karte-karte main sabar rakhana sikh gaya hum
 There is a plethora of experts in this field
 apane kaam main inaki gahari nishtha he, ye jaankaar hai, iraade nek hai or puure adhikaar ke saath apni baat kehete hai
 All of these experts become a little impatient with the newcomers who talk about statistics and evidence and sometimes interfere deeply, while these people have not spent decades on the principles of education
 aise hi ek visheshgy ne kuchhek saal pehle ek din aise hi ek nae-navele se kaha tha ki jo padhai kii baat karte hai, unhen khud padhuya nahin aata
 "did you understand? Patience is important because experts have a lot of influence on education policy
 unhone hi har bachche ko behad umdaa kism kii talim dene kaa apana sapana sach karne ke liye shiksha kaa adhikaar (artii) vidheyak taiyaar kiya
 The dream is ours too, but we were not invited to discuss it
 asal main aaj hamen jo 'adhikaar’ mila he, usamen shiksha kii gunvattta ke maamle main ek khaas nazariye ko tarjeeh di gai he
 This seems more practical for urban Delhi than for villages in Bihar, Rajasthan or Uttar Pradesh
 ham un gaanvon main kaam karte hai
 Have we really accepted that poor Indian parents want schools that have playgrounds and teachers have authentic degrees? Then why are the children of government schools escaping for the last decade, when there are both such teachers and playgrounds? Private schools in the same children, they are often walking in someone's empty rooms and it is not necessary to get all the necessary certificates with the teacher
 par maa-baap yahi doharaate rahete hai ki vah kam-se-kam padhaane to aata he or kuch to mehnat karata he
 We do not believe that only private schools will solve all our problems of education, but how will the parents feel if the children's schools are closed due to non-fulfillment of this law? Perhaps the time has come to lose patience
 pratham ne haal hi main shiksha kii vaarshik dasha-disha kii report jari kii he
 This confirms the worrisome trend seen for the first time last year
 lagbhag samooche bharat main 567 jilon main faile 16,166 gaanvon ke (5 se 16 varsh aayu ke) 4,48,545 bacchon kii pariksha se mili aankadon se ek baat saaf ho jaati he: bharat main buniyadi jod-ghataav kar paane or sidhe-sade paragraph pard paane vaale bacchon kaa anupaat teji se gir rahaa he
 There are few examples of success, but the overall picture is blurred
 phir bhi visheshgyon ne (jaisaa ki artii ke shilpiyon main se ek vinod raina ne india today ke ek ank main likhaa bhi he) haroonges dhang se sara dosha test par daal diya he
 Rainbow's bottom line is that if the child has fever, break the thermometer
 tharmametre bachche main tanaav paidaa karata he or isi vajah se use bukhaar aata hoga
 In Raina's comment, there is a strong confusion about incentives based on test and test numbers
 shiksha kii dasha-disha vaali vaarshik report yah jaanane kaa ek mauka detii he ki yah desh khadaa kahaan he
 His message is that the children are not failing but the country is failing in the ordeal for children
 sidhi-si baat he ki aisi pariksha kaa vastav main bahut maamuli asar hota he, isse itnaa bhar ho saktaa he ki sabko, sabhi staron par zyada koshish or behatar karne kii prerana mili
 Since the real problem is testing, there is no crisis in Raina's world
 kam-se-kam nayaa sankat to nahin hi he
 Things were bad in 1986 and are still bad today
 usee silsile main raina kii siforishein to aisi lagati hai ki pichley teen dashak main shiksha mahakme kaa koi bhi karinda kabhi bhi unhen taiyaar kar saktaa tha (or asal main kai baar aisa hua bhi): sarkari skulon main zyada paisa lagaao; zyada shikshak rakho (par theke vaale nahin); shikshakon ko zyada training do or privet skulon ko haaavee mat hone do
 Looking at all the things, it becomes clear where its roots are: Vinod Raina's original concern is the teacher, not the student
 ve aisi har cheez se ladgaye ko taiyaar hai, jisase adhyapakon ke rasookh or unki tankhwaah par asar padataa ho
 That is why he and many other eminent experts have always been restless with the annual report on the state of education and overall public examinations
 shiksha ke adhikaar main yah pataa lagane kaa adhikaar aakhir kyon nahin diya gaya he ki shiksha vastav main di ja rahi he yaa nahin? pariksha shikshakon kii pole khol detii he
 Illiterate parents find out that their children are failing
 lagaataar or vyapak moolyankan se yah samasya dur ho jaaegi kyonki inamen se adhiktar mata-pita uskaa koi matlab nahin samaj paaenge
 Teachers have their own importance
 shiksha sambandhi kisi bhi pahal kii kamyaabi kii kunjee unheen ke haath main he
 But the school system should be designed according to the children and not according to the teachers, not even for those who teach the teachers and not for those who make the syllabus, write the text books
 praathamikta use milani chahie jo padhgaye main bacchon kii madad kare

 So here is Rahul Gandhi, full of renewed vigor for the future

 The microphone smiles as it unfolds and answers questions
 ab to dadhi bhi banane lage hai
 His dreams for India are now not just a collection of ideas that change the system, but also plan for the future as the Congress is trying hard to minimize the loss in the next election
 unhone vaada kiya he ki congress ke chunaav ghoshnaptr main na sirf shiksha or sehat ke liye jaruri sudhaaron kaa zikr hoga, balki yah bhi bataaya jayega ki zyada rojgaar jutaney or vikaas ke liye upie sarkaar kya karegi
 In the 16-17 January meeting of the Congress Working Committee and the All India Congress Committee, Congressmen saw the Rahul whom they had been wishing for a long time
 ab ve aakraamak hai or kuch kar guzarane ke mood main hai
 Until recently this was not so
 rahul lambii ladaai ke liye kaam karke khush the
 Till now, Rahul has rarely given a speech without citing the three Prime Ministers of the country from the nehru-gandhi family
 unke kandhon par purvajon ke itihaas kaa boj bahut baari tha
 But he took too long to understand that the mood of the country is not only against the UPA government, but he has also turned his back on this family
 congress ke netritv main sarkaar ek taraf nitigat str par pakshpaat or duusari ore bhrashtachar kaa paryaay ban gai he
 India's popular development saga seems to have become a fairytale of history, which exacerbated Rahul and his party
 saath hi narendra modi kii lokapriyata ko bhi hawa de di
 The thunderous failure of the Gujarat model, spread over a huge publicity system, became a direct challenge to the UPA government
 ek ke baad ek ghotaalon kii vajah se arvind kejariwal vah jagah hathiyaane main kaamyaab ho gaye, jo satta pratishthan virdohi ke rup main rahul kabjana chaahate the
 The rise of Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) convenor Kejriwal and the Delhi Assembly elections in December 2013 added fuel to the problem
 party ke bheetar kranti ke vaade karne vaale yuvaraj ke haath se vakt nikalataa ja rahaa he
 Energetic Rahullekin But at the All India Congress Committee meeting at Talkatora Stadium in Delhi, Rahul surprised everyone by delivering new energy in the party beyond his speech
 bhartiya janata party ke piem ummidavaar narendra modi kii ore se ‘‘congress mukt bharat’’ kaa naaraa buland karne kaa rahul ne karaara jawaab diyah ‘‘vipaksh ke log itihaas nahin jaanate
 Congress is not an organization, but a thought that is in our heart
 yah bhaichaare, prem, izzat kii soch he
 This was the thinking of (emperor) Ashoka, Guru Nanak, (emperor) Akbar, Gandhiji also had the same thinking
 yahi soch aap main bhi he, ham main bhi he
 This thinking has been going on in India for 3000 years
 ’’ rahul ne chunauteepurn lahaze main jab kaha, ‘‘ye soch hindustan se koi nahin mitaa saktaa or jisane mitaane kii koshish kii he vah khud mit gaya’’ to vahaan maujuud congressi netaaon kaa utsaah chhalak rahaa tha
 Congress President Sonia Gandhi concluded the session and said, "for a few days we had put ourselves in worry
 lekin aaj spasht ho gaya ki agar ham tay kar len to koi bhi takat congress ko parajeet nahin kar sakati
 "in her initial address, Sonia cheered the workers," "we have seen victory, we have also suffered defeat
" raajnneeti main isse bachaa nahin ja saktaa, lekin hamen khud ko jeevant banaae rakhana he or badali paristhatiyon main bhi aage baduya he
 "suddenly, his speeches are referring to the common man, a much-feared character of Indian politics, rather than family
" talkatoraa stadium main unhone kaha, ‘‘main aapkaa sipaahi hum
 i am willing to do what you say
 ’’ bilkul badale or nae andaaj main rahul ne 2014 ke aam chunaav se pehle hue adhiveshan main dil kii baat kii or ek lakeer khinchate hue tay kar diya ki 21veen sadi kii nai congress ab saamne ai he jahaan aantarik loktantr majboot hoga or yuvaaon kii baat suni jaaegi
 Rahul told industry chiefs at FICCI annual general meeting on December 21, "today the biggest issue is corruption
 ye jonk kii tarah desh kaa khun chus rahaa he
 The UPA government has been criticized a lot, but it has done more work than any other government to curb corruption
 hamen puri takat or majboot iraade se bhrashtachar se laduya hoga
 Earlier on April 4, 2013, Rahul addressed prominent industrialists at a CII meeting in New Delhi
 us samay unhone bharat kii tulana madhumakhi ke chhatey se kii thi, jiskaa twitor par khub majaak bana
 He had said, "people of India keep complaining about something or the other
 unki shikayaton kii vajah yah he ki unke saamne behad jatil halaat hai
 India is a complex country, while China is simple
 isiilie bharat pashchimi or anya inwestors ke sawaalon ke aasaan jawaab nahin de saktaa
 The reality came to light after one election defeat between CII and FICCI speeches
 fikki main rahul kaa najariya ab tak sabase saaf dikhaai diya
 He said on December 21, "our dream for India is of a country whose economy is the largest in the world
" kisi se kam nahin he
 We stand at the gate of the second Green Revolution
 khaane-pine kii chizon ke oonche daam or mahangaai chintaa badha rahe hai
 "rahul's Four C's - Confidence, Communicator, Dedication (consistency) and Consistency in Ideas can not only give a new leader to the country, but also create a new Congress
" samvaad kaa tarika badlakal tak jo vyakti aatmamanthan se samasyaayein pahchaan kar santusht tha, aaj samaadhaan dene laga he
 Rahul is now doing solid work
 alag-alag focus samoohon, anusuchit jati, janajati, alpsankhyak or yuvaaon se sampark kar rahe hai
 The results of the assembly elections on 8 December proved that the Congress is licking the dust in the election grounds
 uske baad se party ne apane ghoshnaptr par teen baithken kii hai
 "there will be two more such meetings in this month," says Ajay Maken, the party's general secretary and head of the communications cell
 ’’ in baithkon main rahul ke sandesh adhik spasht hote hai
 On January 17 at the Talkatora Stadium, a confident Rahul said, "now what the AAP (public) will say, the manifesto will be included by it and the government will show what is included in the manifesto
 ’’rahul ko andaja he ki congressi apni uplabdhiyon ko nahin bhunaa pate
 He said, "opposition's marketing is very good
 ye (bijepi) ganjon ko bhi kangha bech daalate hai
 Now new people (AAP) have come among them who are giving haircuts to Ganj
 ’’ is tarah unhone ek saath narendra modi or arvind kejariwal par nishaanaa saadhaa
 Caught between the action hero Modi and the common man Kejriwal, Rahul is presenting himself as a doer and a ready to talk
 pichley chah hafton main rahul pehle se zyada samvaad karne lage hai
 He survived the press for nine years
 ab ve intervyuu de rahe hai
 Expressing hobbies like swimming and akido
 unhone haal hi main ek hindi akhbaar se kaha, ‘‘meri jindagi main anakani jaisaa koi shabd nahin he
 "they have been advised to speak more on such things that have a good debate," a source familiar with the new PR strategy told India Today
 har roj unhen din kaa news agenda tay karte dikhnaa chahie
 It should not be targeted
 ’’ab rahul kaa rang-dhang puri tarah se badal gaya he
 They talk spontaneously
 raajnneeti ke engri yangamain ab kejariwal ho gaye hai isliye rahul zyada sahaj or sunne ke liye pehle se zyada utsuk dikhne lage hai
 Be it Ficci's speech on 21 December or a press conference with Congress chief ministers on 27 December, he smiled more than before
 kurte-pajame kii jagah kurte or genes ne le lee he
 For the last several elections, Rahul has been claiming that the Congress candidates will be announced soon, but the party could not do so
 ab pehali baar unhone alag-alag rajyon main ummidavaar chunane ke liye screening cameti bana di hai jisamen 10 panel hai
 Among them are his trusted people (see box), so that tickets are given only to those whom he wants to hold the reins of Congress in future
 samiti ke ek sadsy ke anusaar, ‘‘yah pehali baar hoga jab jila congress or block samitiyaan jamini str par lokapriyata ke aadhaar par ummidavaaron kii sifarish karengi
 "rahul has plans to connect with the public
" unhone talkatoraa stadium main kaha ki 15 sansadeey kshetron main log pilot pariyojna ke tahat candidet kaa chunaav karenge, padaadhikari or kaaryakarta vot daalkar chunenge
 Rahul called the first meeting of the committee on 10 January
 congress mukhyalay 24, akbar road ko us shaam unke aane se pehle hi espiji ne gher liya tha, sirf photographers or camerawaalon ko hi baithak kii jagah tak aane kii ijaajat di gai, lekin rahul ne aate hi camaron ke paas jaakar kah diya, ‘‘pehali baar yah kaam aupchaarik rup se or samay-seemaa ke saath ho rahaa he
 We have adopted a system and process within the political party and we will gradually bring the voice of the public within our party
 ’’kar dikhaane kaa samayrahul samaj gaye hai ki vakt kam he
 Must stop dreaming
 kuch karke dikhaane vaale ko ab karke dikhaanaa hoga
 This spanking within them has now reached the bottom
 congress kii rajya ikaayiyon main, pradesh congress samitiyon main peedigat badlaav shuru ho gaya he
 Now some of his key colleagues have become the chairman of the committees
 13 janvari ko 36 varshiya sachin payalat rajasthan pradesh congress ke adhyaksh bana die gaye or congress sachiv rah chuke 39 varshiya arun yadav madhya pradesh bheje gaye
 Only last month, Delhi and Chhattisgarh got Youth Pradesh President
 punjab, kerala or gujarat main nai samitiyaan niyukt kii gayi
 Rahul wants many general secretaries of the party to quit their jobs and contest Lok Sabha elections
 aise hi ek congress netaa ne bataaya, ‘‘ham ravaanagi aadesh kaa intjaar kar rahe hai
 "A Congress leader says that he is now taking more rounds of his Lok Sabha constituency
 party ke ek varisht netaa ke anusaar rahul ne sanghathan main haal ke dinon main kai or badlaav kiye
 Since becoming Vice President last year, he has started quarterly review of State Presidents and Legislature Party leaders
 samiksha baithkon kii karrwai darj hoti he, lakshya tay hote hai or un par najar rakhi jaati he
 The Congress-ruled states have manifesto implementation committees, which monitor the performance of the state government
 sirf vaade karnaa kaaphi nahin he, un par amal jaruri he
 Giving credit to Rahul for every right thing in the Congress is an old party habit, which has never been successful, because half-hearted measures are being adopted
 usase se bhi bura yah hua ki har baar pahal karke rahul maukey se gaayab ho jate the
 In July 2011, when the farmers opposed the government land acquisition, Rahul walked for three days on foot in western Uttar Pradesh but failed to capitalize on this post tour
 jab anna hajaare ke lokapal andolan main noujvaan sadakon par utar aae to rahul lambey samay tak gaayab rahe
 On the 11th day of Hazare's fast on August 26, 2011, he suddenly spoke in Parliament on the subject that the Lokpal be made a constitutional body and passing a bill will not change anything
 us din sansad se baahar nikalate samay unhone patrakaron se kaha ki unka bhaashan ‘‘sara khel badal degaa
 "very few people outside the party agreed with Rahul's self-praise
" ab yah bill kanoon ban chukaa he or party jor-shor se daawa kar rahi he ki rahul ke jor dene par hi yah sambhav hua
 The Parliament session in February will again consider the bills which Rahul has described as his weapon against corruption and which the UPA government is trying to pass
 inamen visal blor sangrakshan vidheyak, nyaayik maanak or uttardaayitv vidheyak, bhrashtachar nirodhak kanoon sanshodhan vidheyak, citijan charter or sarkari kharid vidheyak shaamil hai
 Rahul is showing that he will stand in the political arena and calling the ordinance rubbish was part of his long game
 (saal kii shuruyaat main kerala ke kaaymkulam main youth congress kii raily ke dauraan rahul gandhi)lo, aakhir main aa gaya!lokapal vidheyak par charchaa ke dauraan rahul ne kuch mudde jarur uthaae the, jinka samaadhaan in vidheyakon main hona he, lekin pichley do saal main unhone vidheyak paas karaane kii koi khaas koshish nahin kii
 Now that elections are on the head, according to sources in the advertising industry, the Congress will spend 500 million
 kaa vigyaapan kaa khel khilne ke bare main soch rahi he, jisaki jimmedaari dentsu india ko di gai he
 With the upa's achievements in the advertisements, Rahul will be elevated as a warrior for the anti-corruption system
 piaar companiyon ke pregentation ke aadhaar par rahul ne chunaav main party ke soshal media abhiyaan kii jimmedaari jenesis barsan-marslar ko saunpi he
 Maken has been discussing major issues of publicity with these two agencies day and night for the last few days
 bataaya jaataa he ki inhen priyanka gandhi kii manjuuri mil chuki he
 On 14 January, Maken posted two advertisements on Twitter which the party would release in newspapers and on social media
 ek vigyaapan kaa naaraa he-rahulji ke nau hathiyaar, dur karenge bhrashtachar
 It contains a list of bills that the UPA government has passed or will pass
 duusare vigyaapan main bhrashtachar mukt bharat ke rahul gandhi ke sapane kaa zikr he
 In Congress advertisements, the Right to Information Act (RTI), enacted in 2005, is credited to Rahul, who entered politics at the same time
 pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne nae saal kii shuruyaat 3 janvari ko apane samvaadadaata sammelan main bhrashtachar or berogari ke maamle main sarkaar kii asafalataa sweekaar karne se kii, to rahul ne upie kii tamaam safaltaaon kaa shrey liya or jo kuch galat hua usase kinaaraa kar liya
 Talking about change is easier than bringing it
 duniya kii sabase badi loktantric party congress ko chalaane vaale khandaan ko hameshaa aisi gond kii tarah bataaya gaya he, jo party ko baandhe rakhti he
 Today the situation is that the family needs to keep the party united
 desh kaa mood gandhi parivaar ke khilaaf aisa kabhi nahin rahaa
 Never since when Sonia Gandhi took over the reins of the party more than 15 years ago and the party was once again occupied by the dynasty
 pichley do saal ke chunavi nateezon ko dekhte hue lagata he ki party ko haar kii aadat pad chuki he
 The Congress has lost 12 of the 16 assembly elections and won only 583 seats since 1974

 "rahul vision" for new India: In UPA-2, the Congress was not yet able to breathe due to allegations of corruption and breathless governance
 sarkaar ke kaamkaaj kii charchaa bhi nahin ho rahi thi
 Rahul Gandhi is now aggressive about taking the achievements of the government to the public
 ve chaahate hai ki party ke netaa or kaaryakarta janata ko bataaen ki congress ne bharat main adhikaron ke yug kii shuruyaat kii he jisamen soochna kaa adhikaar, shiksha kaa adhikaar or bhukh se mukti ke liye bhojan kaa adhikaar shaamil he
 As the leader of election campaign, it is Rahul's responsibility to convey the message of the party to the people
 rahul ne us vot bank ko rokane kii koshish kii jo aap or bijepi kii ore khisak rahaa he
 When Rahul spoke of expelling 14 crore people from BPL, he also said that there is a population of 70 crore in the country which is above the poverty line but below the middle class
 nimna madhyam varg ko rahul ne bharosa dilaayaa ki agle paanch saal main congress is tabake ko madhyam varg kii qatari main laakar khadi karegi
 Rahul was not officially made the Prime Ministerial candidate from the Congress, but he indicated that he would take over the reins the next time the party formed the government
 pradhanmantri manmohan singh ko ummid he, ‘‘rahul ke netritv main nai urja aegi
 i do not doubt that we will get full success in the Rahul-led election campaign in 2014
 ’’bilkul badale or nae andaaj main rahul ne 2014 ke aam chunaav se pehle hue adhiveshan main dil kii baat kii or ek lakeer khinchate hue tay kar diya ki 21veen sadi kii nai congress ab saamne ai he jahaan aantarik loktantr majboot hoga or yuvaaon kii baat suni jaaegi
 Rahul Gandhi is changing, but will he be able to change the 128-year-old party that gave up the desire to win
 desh kii janata kaa dil jeetne se pehle rahul ko apni party ke logon kaa man jeetna hoga

 com / jrmin7hnrs — Shreya Ghoshal (@shreyaghoshal) February 6, 2015 duniya kii do badi companiyaan aipal or samsung ek duusare kii pratidwandi hai
 Apple has also recently launched iphone x and iphone 8 Plus credentials iphone X
 ye smartphone ek tarah se samsung ke flagship smartfones Galaxy Note 8 or Galaxy S8 ke rivel he
 But Samsung will also benefit from the sale of iphoen X
 teardown report ke mutabik iphone x main samsung ke kuch parts lagaae gaye hai
 There are two parts of Samsung - battery and OLED display
 yani oled disple or bydaree se samsung kii kamai acchhee khaasi hogi
 The more the iphone x is sold, the more Samsung will benefit
 reports main daawa kiya gaya he ki iphone x main lagaae gaye ye samsung ke in do componants se samsung har iphone x par lagbhag 110 dollar ( 7,220 rupee) kamayega
 Apparently, this is a special smartphone of Apple and that is why the introduction of iphone 8 and iphone 8 Plus has faded in India
 matlab ye ki duniya bhar main iphone x kaa intjaar ho rahaa he or isaki bikri bhi zyada hone kii ummid he
 According to Apple's estimates, 130 million units of the iphone x can be sold
 gauratlab he ki samsung kaaphi pehle se apane flagship smartfones main OLED disple de rahi he
 But Apple has used OLED panel in iphone x for the first time
 haalanki aipal ne iphone 8 or 8 Plus main abhi bhi alsidi disple kaa hi istemaal kiya gaya he
 Because of this technology, the iphone x has a bezel-less edge to edge display
 da wal street jarnal ke mutabik har iphone x kii bikri par samsung ko 110 dollar kaa phayda hoga
 Let us tell you that this benefit will not be given to Samsung Electronics, which manufactures Galaxy smartphones, while this advantage will be given to Samsung's second arm
 kyonki samsung ke kai bijness he jisamen se ek samsung electronics he jo handset main deal karti he
 The Wall Street Journal estimates that earnings from the iphone x could be more than $ 4 billion, more than producing parts for the Galaxy S8
 chunki philhal OLED disple sirf samsung hi banaati he, isliye aipal ke paas koi doosraa opshan bhi nahin he
 Apart from this, Samsung also manufactures DRAM chip and NAND flash which Apple needs for its iphone

 This merger will dominate leeco's smartphone industry

 In Bihar, the RJD-LJP and the Congress's grand alliance are expected to disintegrate
 jis argedy-algepi or congress kii mahagathbandhan kii baat bihar main chal rahi he usamen ramvilas paswan kii upeksha, party ko nagavar guzar rahi he
 Paswan is not even approved of Lalu's formula on seat sharing, as well as the words of Lalu and his leaders are also passing on to Paswan now, then the question is whether Paswan will be separated from this alliance
 aara se rama singh, navada se surajbhaan singh ye wo do siten hai jinhen is baar lalu kisi bhi surat main chhodane ko taiyaar nahin hai
 Lalu's gesture to Paswan was enough
 haalanki, paswan ne abtak khulkar gathbandhan ke khilaaf nahin bolaa he lekin unki naaraazgi saaf hoti ja rahi he
 Lalu Yadav said that this time from here he will not give the seat to the criminal and it pierced Ram Vilas Paswan
 jis criminal ko tikat naa dene kii baat lalu kar rahe the darasal wo paswan ke un siton (aara or navada) par daawa chhodane kaa ishaara tha jise pichhali baar paswan ne lalu yadav se liya tha
 LJP supremo Ram Vilas Paswan said, `` There is no clear picture, the statement of Laluji and all the leaders is coming that all the secular forces should come together but the conversation that should be on it has not started
 
 jab hamaari or argedy kii hi baatcheet nahin ho paa rahi he to congress se kaise hogi
 As soon as he came out of jail, Lalu Yadav first told Ram Vilas Paswan that he would not listen to him this time, talking about not giving tickets to tainters and criminals
 saath hi party ke duusare netaaon ne saaf kar diya ki chaahe jo bhi party ho, use uski aukaat ke hisaab se tikat milegaa
 Despite Paswan's displeasure, RJD leaders are not in the mood to give preference to LJP
 party ke bade netaa raghuvansh prasad singh ne kaha, ‘pehle apana apana ummidavaar dikhaaen or jiske jo ummidavaar ladane laayak honge use ladaaya jayega
 It will not be that they will search for candidates by taking seats
 unke paas ladane vaale honge, utane pahalwaan dikhaaen or seat len
 But this time it will not work if a man will find a seat
 ’pichhali loksabhaa chunaav main lalu ne congress ko darkinar kar paswan ko 12 siten di thi or wo sabhi siten algepi haar gai thi
 According to news reports, Paswan was expecting the same number of seats this time, but Lalu is not agreeing to give Paswan more than four seats this time talking about forming a grand alliance
 aise main paswan ne gathbandhan par sawaal uthaa diya he
 Now it will have to be seen whether Paswan stays in this alliance or holds on to Nitish

 dies group ke vaais chairman rajeev kumaar yun hi ek baithki main doston ke saath gapshap kar rahe the
 Then an acquaintance came to him and said, "rajiv bhai, a toffee named Pulse has arrived in the market, eating and watching is very tasty
 " apni hi company ke utpaada pulse se judaa yah vakya bataate hue rajeev hans padate hai
 In fact, most of the hard boiled candies in the Indian market were being made with the same orange and mango flavor keeping in mind the children
 desh ke hard candi bazaar ke 50 fisadi hisse par aam kaa flavor haaavee he
 Caramel and Orange are followed by numbers
 international market main orange number van he
 Rajeev says, "we wanted to bring totally different candy
 kachche aam ko sidhe nahin khaaya jaataa, namak ke saath khaaya jaataa he
 Keeping this habit in mind, Pulse was launched after six years of hard work
 swaad munh main khulne-ghulne ke pattern par shodh karke yah sunishchit kiya gaya ki 4 gram kii pulse jeebh par rakhane ke 30 se 50 second tak kachche aam kaa swaad de or namakeen-chatapataapan jeebh par faile
 If someone chewed instead of sucking, it tastes different
 saadhaaran candi 50 second main khatm ho jaati he lekin pulse kaa masala uske baad ghulkar ek alag anand detaa he
 Those who prepared it had such a directive that the eye of the eater should be closed when the piquancy comes
 ek rupye kii yah pehali candi thi
 Earlier, all candies were sold for 50 paise
 dies group ne apane bharosemand utpaadon ke jariye isi tarah se upabhoktaaon kii nabj lambey samay se pakad rakhi he
 Rajeev, 55, a commerce graduate from Ramjas College, entered the family business in 1986
 unke purakhe haryana ke karnal se dilli aae the
 In 1929, Lala Dharmapala started the business from a shop in Chandni Check
 pushtaini kaarobaar itr or sugandhit tambaakoo kaa tha
 Dharmapala's son Satyapal began to adapt the company to modern packing and a new market
 rajnigandha jaise product unhone hi launch kiye
 Today DS Group also produces a range of beverages, confectionery, deodorant, and milk products, along with tobacco and pan spices, a salt-spice catch kitchen range, catch spring water and mango delights
 dilli main lutian jone kii kai imaaraton main kaich spring water kii supplai he
 8,000 crore with a restaurant named Manu Maharani
 kii ye company hospitality sarvice main bhi aa gai he
 The history of this company suggests that it has a keen sense of taste and aroma
 rajeev use kuch yun bayaan karte haih ''bantwaare ke baad desh main log yatraaen zyada karne lage or paan khaane waalon ke liye har baar paan lekar chalanaa mumkin na tha
 Hence, there was a need for something which could satisfy the need of betel water is vajah se kanpur main paan masala banane kii kutir udyog ke taur par shuruyaat hui
 In the same episode, in 1976 we also launched a brand of pan masala called Tansen
 diferent tone or test kaa he lekin harek ko uskaa swaad pasand nahin aata
 He was not very successful
 uske baad 5-6 saal tak kai formule banaae or parakhe gaye
 People were tasted and their opinions taken and suggestions were noted
 1983 main jaakar rajnigandha kaa janm hua
 The launching was also done by Mansukhbhai Kothari, the then owner of Paan Parag and a good friend of Papa
 papa nae-navele naam bhi dhundha karte the
 He also had a deep understanding of flowers and their fragrance
 unhen sugandhi kaa tital mila hua tha
 He named his company's pan masala after Rajnigandha Phool
 "rajeev ke pita satyapal kii ghranshakti itani teevr thi ki ve itr soonghkar bataa dete the, kitne saal purana he
 It is also how much the flower has grown at how much weight
 haalanki ab yah sab kaam mashine karti hai
 Rajeev proudly states that Rajinigandha is being eaten and accepted by his business rival himself
 company kii research unit or production line main sau se zyada utpaadon par kaam chal rahaa he
 "we keep making our products better," explains Rajiv, who is a reserve
 kai products 15-15 saal se research teble par hai
 "it is possible to introduce some of them in the market in 2018
 company ne tulsi zarda 1979 main utaara
 In 1985 the machine was brought from Germany and a half gram pack of basil was taken out
 taaki logon ko pack main kam tambaakoo na mili
 Initially the machine would run on a few days in a month
 1987 main rajnigandha kaa chota pack aayaa or logon ne jodi bana lee
 The company then launched a "double fun" market, which has been shut down due to a new law related to tobacco products
 tulsi ke dabl jiro se lekar paanch jiro tak vairient hai
 Zero increases with increasing quality and Essence, but double Zero is the highest
 ''baba" company kaa premium brand he jo kareeb 55 saal purana he
 Its debut, name and logo are all inspired by Laughing Buddha
 ab baat dies group ke kichan products kii
 Its catch was prepared as a hobby
 rajeev bataate hai, ''ham log khaanaa khate the to namak aksar nami se jam jaaya karata tha
 Ravinder Kumar, the elder brother and chairman, came to mind that why not prepare such a salt which comes out of the box easily
 " bas kaich salt taiyaar
 Salt is specially processed for this
 isaki technology videsh se laai gai or ise rotary top packing main diya gaya
 Table top packs of chaat masala and black pepper with salt were prepared
 phir dealron se demand ai ki graahak company ke chanaa masala or garam masala jaise duusare products ke bare main bhi poochhate hai
 They also need a kitchen product
 us par bhi kaam shuru ho gaya
 The kitchen range of catches came in 2000
 group ke kul kaarobaar main kichan masaalon kii hissedari kareeb 12 fisadi he
 Spices are grounded with cold grinding technique, which keeps their taste and aroma intact
 company 1999 ke aasapaas bacchon-mahilaon ke liye bina supaari vaala mouth freshnar nikaalnaa chaahati thi par uske peeche soch yah bhi thi ki usamen supaari vaala karaaraapan bhi ho
 Rajeev says, "we have introduced a natural sweetener like fennel with fennel, cardamom, brahmi to the market
" haalanki iskaa formulation food sefti ke lihaaj se kai baar badla bhi gaya
 There are more than a hundred copies of this in the market, but our product is still unmatched on the basis of quality
 hamaare product istemaal karne waalon ko duusare main vah santushti nahin milti
 This is the reason why we do not get any special challenge in the market
 " company kii cells main paan masaale or tambaakoo utpaadon kii badi hissedari he
 For every product to be topped, Rajiv is sitting like a passion for it
 iskaa namoona unke noida ke sector 67 main satyapal sugandhi maarg par bane aaleeshaan korporate daftar main dekha ja saktaa he, jahaan aadhunik dizin or kalatmak murtiyon-paintings kaa laajawab najaara dikhataa he
 Above all, there is a corporate museum built in this office, where automation and drama, the film has a unique pattern
 forest section main jis paudhe kaa zikr shishe ke board par aap padhenge, vahaan aapako usee kii khushboo bhi aa rahi hogi
 At the same time, a 360-degree theater running with 17 projectors imported takes the experience of 4D to a new level
 par khatakane vaali baat yahi he ki is bhavy museum ko company ke aamantran par hi dekha ja saktaa he
 It takes an hour for the technician to activate the system of the museum so that the software-hardware synergy is resolved
 rajeev halki muskaan ke saath kehete hai, ''sab kuch ham paison ke liye nahin karte
 Some have passion too
 8 march, 2014 ko hamane papa ke naam se korporate museum shuru kiya
 It was the happiest moment for us
 lekin 1995 main dukh kii vah ghadi bhi ai jab mummy-papa donon kaa saath hamase chhot gaya
 They did not give us a chance to serve
 " rajeev kii patni sunita gupta ne is puure safar main har kadam par unka puraa saath diya he
 The DS Group's focus has never been on exports
 company kaa maananaa rahaa ki uske utpaadon ke liye bharat main hi bahut bada kanjumar base maujuud he
 But now there is also being noticed
 rajeev bataate hai, ''ab ham ranneetik taur par niryaat par dhyaan kendrit kar rahe hai
 We will pay special attention to exports in the coming days
 " company ko paneer or ghi ke niryaat main kaaphi sambhaavna najar aa rahi he
 It has received extremely positive response
 company nivesh kii apni jaruraton ko 99 fisadi apane sansadhano se hi puraa karti he
 Sometimes a very small loan is repaid
 dies group kii kamyaabi kaa raaj uski upabhoktaaon kii pulse (nabj) pakadaaey kii kaabiliyat he

 vyapaariyon ko sochna chahie ki unhen dar kyon lag rahaa tha? ve ro rahe the magar kyon bol nahin paa rahe the? aisa isile hua kyonki ve samarthak or bhakthi main khud ko dhaal kar apni shakti ganvaa chuke the
 They were also involved in this game for a long time, whoever questions the government, abuse it
 unhen pataa nahin tha ki ve kya kar rahe hai
 He was joining the abuses and ending the space to raise voice in democracy, which he had to suffer first and foremost
 chah maheene main kitna nuksaan hua hoga
 They were finding that the dock media would not support them
 aayega to sarkaar kii agenciyon ke dar se ve bolne ke laayak bhi nahin rahe
 The lesson is that you must like a party, vote again or again, even if you do, you preserve the voter's status
 gujarat chunaav kaa bhay nahin hota to unki maangen kabhi nahin maani jaatin
 They have the power to speak as long as they are voters, citizens
 jaise hi ve bhakt or samarthak main badalte hai, shaktiviheen ho jate hai
 Then, on expressing dissatisfaction, they will be called rebels
 loktantr main asantosh zaahir karne kaa adhikaar har kisi ke paas hona chahie
 If the business class had already behaved like a voter, then your business would not have lost lakhs
 tippaniyan The second lesson for businessmen is that when someone questions the government, they support him
 aaj ke daur main sawaal karnaa aasaan nahin he
 The job is even at stake
 koi sawaal kiske liye karata he
 What if two or four people like us do not write on GST? Therefore, protect those who question
 varanaa ek din jab fansenge to aapaki baat kehane vaala koi nahin hoga
 You know that the listener does not care what you are saying by reaching power
 vipaksh kii awaz, sawaal karne kii parampara kaa saath dijie, uskaa bachaav kiijie varanaa maukey kaa laabh uthaa kar rakshak hi bhakshak ban jayega
 It was already made
 godi media ne vyapaariyon kii awaz ko dabaaya
 Traders too started to feel this
 isliye un sabhi patrakaron ko badhai jinaki jiesti kii barbaadi kii khabar bhale hi andar ke panne par or kahin kone main chhapi
 The government was also unheard of for several months
 chote mote badlaavon ko lagu karti rahi magar mukhya maangon kii taraf dhyaan nahin diya
 Everyone has accepted that bjp's victory in Gujarat is certain
 usamen koi agar magar nahin he
 i also agree
 phir aisa kya hua ki jo sarkaar desh bhar ke vyapaariyon ko nahin sun rahi thi wo achaanak sunne lagi? gujarat chunaav ke bahaane hi sahi, dare sahame or barbaad ho rahe vyapaariyon ko phayda hua he
 By the way, the Election Commission's code of conduct has become a pickle
 ab is sanstha ko bhul hi janaa chahie
 Rates have been cut on such a large scale
 pehle aap chunaavon ke dauraan petrol ke daam kam nahin kar sakate the
 Anyway, we are seeing all the institutions collapsing
 ek din isaki keemat aap hi chukaayenge
 Traders should wonder why they felt scared? They were crying but why were they unable to speak? This happened because they had lost their power by molding themselves into supporters and devotion
 ve bhi lambey samay tak is khel main shaamil the ki jo bhi sarkaar par sawaal kare, use gaali do
 They had no idea what they were doing
 ve gaaliyon main shaamil hokar loktantr main awaz uthaane ke spes ko khatm kar rahe the jiskaa sabase pehle or sabase zyaada nuksaan unheen ko uthaanaa padaa
 What a loss it must have been in six months
 unhen pataa chal rahaa tha ki godi media unka saath nahin degaa
 They will not be able to speak due to fear of government agencies
 sabak yahi he ki aap zarur ek party ko pasand karen, baar-baar vot karen yaa kisi ko ek baar bhi karen to bhi aap matadaata kii haisiyat ko bachaae rakhie
 If the Gujarat election was not feared, their demands would never have been met
 jab tak ve matadaata hai, naagarik hai tabhi tak unke paas bolne kii shakti he
 As they turn into devotees and supporters, they become powerless
 tab asantosh zaahir karne par baagi qaraar die jaaenge
 Everyone should have the right to express dissatisfaction in democracy
 agar vyapaaree varg pehle se hi voter kii tarah vyavhaar karte to aapke bijness ko lakhon kaa ghaataa na hota
 The comments vyapaariyon ke liye doosraa sabak yah he ki jab koi sarkaar se sawaal kare, to uskaa saath den
 Today's question is not easy to question
 naukari tak daanv par lag jaati he
 Whom does anyone question
 agar jiesti par hamaare jaise do chaar das log nahin likhte to kya hota? isliye sawaal karne waalon kaa bachaav kiijie
 Otherwise, when you are trapped one day, there will be no one to talk to you
 aap jaanate hi hai ki sunne vaale ko satta main pahunch kar fark nahin padataa ki aap kya kah rahe hai
 Support the voice of the opposition, question the tradition, defend it or else the savior will become a glutton by taking advantage of the opportunity
 ban hi gaya tha
 The dock media suppressed the voices of the traders
 vyapaaree bhi ye mahasoos karne lage the

 prakaashak hind yugma ke saujany sepustak anshah 'oktober jankshan'das saal pehle
 October 2010, the city of Banarasbanaras resides somewhere in between the dream and the dream
 banaras main koi samaj nahin saktaa ki sach kya he or sapana kya
 If someone comes here to find the truth, then some forget the dream, but Banaras is a petty city
 yah logon ke sach ko sapane main badal detaa he or sapane ko sach kii tarah dikhaane lagata he
 In the intersections of Benares, the meaning of life keeps going round and round, if someone catches it, then someone returns empty handed
 shahar thodaa mudi he, har kisi par khulata nahin or har kisi se khulata nahin
 The matter is a little deeper, if someone understands it or not, Jai Bhole Nath! Now, in any story, a boy and a girl meet somewhere
 duniya main jahaan-jahaan koi ladkaa-ladki mil sakate hai wo sab kuch likhaa ja chukaa he
 From college to office, by train to airplane
 chunki chitra or sudeep donon ko kahin-na-kahin to milanaa hi tha
 Hence Sudeep and Chitra meet at Assi Ghat
 ve donon kabhi mili nahin hote agar us samay pizgeria cafe main bahut zyada bheed nahin hoti
 The crowd was so large that the waiter of the pizzeria made the two sit together
 haalanki, donon hi me-time chaahate the
 Both wanted to sit alone but it was difficult to get a separate table in such a crowd
 to donon ko saath main baithna padaa
 Both did not want to stand
 yah kahani shuru hi na hui hoti agar us waiter ne apana bijness badhaane ke chakkar main in donon ko saath nahin baitha diya hota
 The work of the waiter was so much in this story
 ab vah inkaa order lene kaa baad kabhi vaapis nahin aayega
 Have you ever thought, every day people start such stories who never realize how important part of the story they are
 sudeep kii umr he kareeb 25 saal
 She is wearing a casual black T-shirt and blue jeans
 chitra kii umr he 26-27 saal
 Chitra is wearing a short kurta and blue jeans
 ye donon koun hai kya karte hai dhire-dhire aapako pataa chal jayega
 It is worth knowing that the two are together at the cafe table
 donon ne ek ek pizza or neembu shahad pani order kiya he
 "why do people come to Benaras?" Why not know but know when they come
 ''kab aate hai?''jab aage koi rasta nahin dikhataa
 'sudeep and Chitra could also answer these questions to each other
 lekin ye sawaal sudeep or chitra ke thik peeche vaali teble par baithe kinhin do logon ne kiya
 Both of them heard their voice
 in do logon ne agar us din yah sawaal na poocha hota to shaayad yah kahani shuru hi nahin hui hoti
 Listening to those two strangers sitting at the back table, Chitra said, "how true!" Where are you stuck! Sorry, maybe i shouldn't ask
 ' sudeep ne kaha
 'it's okay, i am stuck at one place in my book' Story is not moving forward 'here was a poetry event at BHU
 vahaan se invitesan aayaa to sochaa shaayad banaras main moksh to sabko miltaa he shaayad mujhe kahani mil jaae
 Why have you come to Benares? ' Chitra asked, trying unsuccessfully to listen to the people sitting at the back table
 'mere ek dost kii shaadi thi or banaras ke bare main bahut kuch sun rakhaa tha' kai saalon se yahan aane kaa man tha
 
 ''kaisaa laga banaras?''jaisaa suna tha vaisaa to nahin laga abhi tak
 "how long have you been?" kal hi friend kii shaadi thi
 "it takes time to climb Benares
" ' chitra ne kaha
 Sorry, i don't get it
 ''do din ke liye aaoge to banaras kabhi acha nahin lagegaa
 Come to Benares and come leisurely
 banaras aate bahut log hai lekin pahunch kam log pate hai
 "this last line of yours passed over me, but tell me one thing, Banaras will change a bit because of staying longer?" Well, i will just say this, wait more than two days and then you will not ask these questions
 'itane main pizza aa gaya
 Both started eating their own pizza
 sudeep pizza khate hue ghat ke paas baithe college ke bacchon ko dekhne laga
 Those children were probably from Arts College of Banaras Hindu University
 ve ghat par baithkar ghat kaa sketch bana rahe the
 Some people were not even aware that a part of him has been captured in a sketch of an unknown boy
 hamaare kitne hisse duniya main kahan-kahan kaid hai ye ham kabhi nahin jaan paayenge
 Both did not say anything until they ate half a pizza
 chunki, bheed bahut thi to waiter ne sudeep or chitra kii teble par ek-do logon ko or feet karne kii koshish kii
 Chitra told the waiter that one or two people were coming
 waiter ko bhi pataa tha chitra jhooth bol rahi he
 Chitra wanted to sit comfortably
 'dekho, pizza aadha bachaa he
 If i ate early, the waiter would say to go
 mujhe thodi der yahan baithne kaa man he
 Till then, why don't you tell something about yourself for the time pass? ”sudeep laughed on hearing this
 'kamaal he! mujhase koi aise baat nahin karata
 By the way, why don't you tell something about yourself for the time pass? ”ask
 ''shahar?''shahar matlab, jahaan kii main hoon yaa jahaan main rahati hoon
 Mostly there are two cities
 ek jahaan ke ham hote hai or ek jahaan ham rahete hai
 "where you live"
 ''dilli
 And yours? ”mumbai
 or tum rahane vaali kahan kii ho?''bhopal
 and you
 ''lakhanu
 "by the way these city questions, do you seem to be an mba-type employee doing boring jobs?" "are you judging me?" "yes, i am
 ab kuch acha bataao chaahe jhooth bataao, majaa aana chahie bas
 "I did not study after 12th
 ''what! are you serious?''100% syrius
 "this is not the case, what are you doing then?" i don't do anything special
 maine karne ke liye log rakhe hue hai
 "you have given relaxation, you have started throwing it
" lekin chalo kam-se-kam ye boring to nahin he
 Now you ask
 ''tum kitaab kyon likhnaa chaahati ho?''phir se boring sawaal, kisi ko nahin pataa hota ki wo kitaab kyon likhnaa chahta he
 "still there must be a reason?" i don't know why i want to write
 shaayad nem-fame ke liye
 next me
 ''pucho
 "what's your name?" Now you started asking boring questions
 ''ek boring sawaal to puch hi sakati hoon
 '' Sudeep Yadav
 ''ek minute, ek minute
 Sudeep Yadav is a heard name
 ''tumhaari company kaa naam kya he?''phir boring sawaal
 "hey, tell me
 ''book maai trip
 "so you are the" Sudeep Yadav! "" Yes, i am Sudeep Yadav
 naam ke pehle da lag gaya he mujhe nahin pataa tha
 Especially when someone is eating such a good pizza, then i should not talk at all
 ' sudeep ne pizza kaa ek pis apni plate main rakhte hue kaha
 'I read about you in the paper
 lekin ye starop vagairah mujhe zyada samaj nahin aata
 "I don't read the newspaper
 itnaa time hi nahin rahata
 "so how do you know what is going on around?" Chitra asked while eating the last piece of his pizza
 'meri assistant mujhe sab akhabaaron main se mere kaam kii khabaron kii ek report banaakar bhej detii he
 "so Sudeep Yadav who does not have any time at all, is sitting here in Benaras and is eating pizza comfortably and i am talking to him a little boring
" ''bataaya na, main ek dost kii shaadi main aayaa tha or phir maine teen din kaa brake bhi le liya
 "break for what?" My doctor also presscreated leave with medicine
 banaras kaa plan bana to sochaa yahan rukkar dekhte hai
 "what happened to you?" You are not getting much personal! When did Writer start asking Journalist type questions? Sudeep finished his pizza 'the waiter was now ambush on his table
 'sori, lekin sudeep yadav aise hi kisi teble par takaraa jaae to thodaa excitement to banataa he
 ''I was lying
 main sudeep yadav nahin hoon
 Nor do i have any company
 maine emb kiya he or main narmal-si naukari karata hoon
 Had ever read an article about Sudeep Yadav, just today, seeing the opportunity, threw it away
 'chitra ko kuch samaj nahin aayaa ki saamne baitha hua ladkaa sach bol rahaa he yaa jhooth
 'aarti is about to begin
 acha laga aapse milakar miss riter
 "chitra Pathak's name is mine and yours?" What difference does it make, believe it is Sudeep Yadav
 apni kitaab puri kar lenaa to bhejnaa mujhe
 My address is on the company's website
 'sudeep aarti dekhne chalaa gaya
 There he became part of the sketch of those children
 chitra ne apana bill adaa kiya
 She also sat down to watch the aarti at the ghat
 usko sudeep dikh rahaa tha lekin vah jis taraf baithi thi vahaan se sudeep usko nahin dekh saktaa tha
 In the middle of Aarti, Chitra was looking towards Sudeep
 thodi der baad sudeep jahaan baitha tha vahaan se uthakar ja chukaa tha
 Chitra tried to look at him nearby for a minute or two but he did not show up
 har adhuri mulaaqaat ek puri mulaaqaat kii ummid lekar aati he
 Every complete meeting is left as an incomplete meeting before the next meeting
 ek adhuri ummid hi to he jiske sahare ham buudhe hokar bhi buudhe nahin hote
 Just before dying, an old lover had said that if a sister-in-law can live on such a big world for one hour, then after dying, i can die by tying her hopes in another world
 boodhon kii ummid bhari baaten sunani chahie
 Looks good, just don't believe them
 lekin ye sab baaten ek umr main samaj kahan aati hai! chitra ko ummid na hoti to usne vah sab thode kiya hota jo usne kiya
 Chitra went and sat where Sudeep was sitting
 usne apane mobile par sudeep yadav naam google kiya
 This was the same Sudeep Yadav about whom Chitra had heard little
 chitra ne ek baar phir chaaron or najar daudai lekin vah kahin dikhaa nahin
 After finishing Aarti, she comes to her room
 usne apana laptop kholkar ek panna likhaa
 After a while, i closed the laptop and started writing something in my small notebook
 thodi der main vah usase bhi bor ho gai
 He turned on the hotel room TV
 tivi par ishkia film kaa gaanaa 'dil to baccha he ji' chal rahaa tha
 She went to take a bath after turning off the light
 jab vah nahaakar lauti tab tivi par 'munni badnaam hui' chal rahaa tha
 He switched off the TV and started trying to sleep
 udhar sudeep ne taj hotel main entry karte hi resepshan par apane liye apadet poocha
 The girl standing at the reception told him with great respect that the call of aristocrat sir was received
 unhone kaha he ki offis main sab narmal he
 May you be comfortable on your vacation

 Sudeep asks the reception girl to give a wake up call at 5 am

 He did not notice the volume of the TV was very high and the song 'munni Badnaam Hui' started playing as soon as the TV was turned on
 usne turant tivi band kar diya

 No one knows where the price of petrol, diesel and cooking gas will go
 kai maheenon se janata petrol deazal or rasoi gas ke daam die ja rahi thi or yah maan liya gaya tha ki janata is baar uff tak nahin kar rahi he kyonki vah sarkaar ke kilaaf naare nahin laga rahi he
 The international situation regarding oil remains as it was before
 sab kuch antarrashtriya nahin he
 There are some problems within India
 dekhte dekhte desh ke kai shaharon main 90 rupee litre se adhik daam par petrol bikne laga tha
 The government has taken some steps today, which will bring some relief, no one knows how long the relief will be
 antarrashtriya bazaar main kachche tel kaa bhav 85 dollar pahunch gaya he jo november 2014 ke baad sabase adhik he
 Finance Minister Jaitley himself came to press conference and said that the government has reduced one and a half rupees on petrol and diesel
 tel companiyaan apni taraf se ek rupaya prati litre daam kam karengi
 Overall, the central government and the oil companies have reduced the price by Rs 2
5 per liter
 arun jetali ne kaha, 'aaj hamane interministerial discshan main tay kiya or pradhanmantri ko prastaav bheja or unhone sweekaar kiya
 We will reduce excise duty by one and a half rupees
 oil marketing company ek rupee kii katautee apni prising main karenge, centre kii ore se ham log dhai rupye turant kanzumors ko relif denge, petrol or deazal donon main revenue department vil ebjorb 1
 50 rupees which is the revenue fixed by the center, the price of crude oil is fixed
 rajya sarkaron kaa jo waite he, wo aid valorem he, percentage main he, kuch kaa 31 percent he kuch kaa kam he
 States have 29%
 crude kaa daam badhata he to centre kaa revenue utana hi rahata he
 States' revenue increases as the price of crude oil increases
 sabhi rajya sarkaron ko likh rahaa hum ki jaise dhai rupee centre sarkaar ebjorb kar rahi he usee tarah rajya sarkarein bhi logon ko raahat den
 Absorbs two and a half rupees from VAT
 ' The Finance Minister said two things in this press conference
 pehla ki jab kachche tel ke daam badhate hai to centre kaa rajasav utana hi rahata he
 States' earnings grow
 aisa kyon hota he
 Because the excise duty imposed by the center is fixed at 19 rupees 48 paise since October last year
 rajyon kii kamai isliye badhati he kyonki dealer ko jis daam par tel companiyaan detii hai us par waite lagaati hai
 The more expensive the oil companies pay to the oil dealer, the more the revenue from VAT will increase to the state governments
 ham aapako bataa den ki modi sarkaar ke kaarykaal ke pehle chaar saal main petroleum sector se kul kamai kitni hui
 18 lakh 23 thousand 760 crores have been earned from various types of tax including custom, excise, VAT, crude oil cess
 isamen se bharat sarkaar kii kamai 11 lakh 4 hazaar 72 karod, rajyon kii kul kamai 7 lakh 19,688 karod rahi
 These figures are as of March 2018
 march se lekar ab tak kitni kamai hui hogi, pichley saal kii kamai ke aadhaar par anumaan lagaaein to isamen aap dhai lakh karod se zyada kii raashi or jod dijie
 That is, in four years, the Center and the states have earned more than 21 lakh crores by taxing petroleum products
 ye saare aankade petroleum mantralay ke hai
 Our colleague Himanshu Shekhar Mishra has said on the basis of Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan's statement in the Rajya Sabha that in April 2014 the excise duty of the Center on petrol was 9 rupees 48 paise
 4 aktubar ko dhai rupee kii katautee ke baad bhi 16 rupee 98 paise he
 As per April 2014, there has been an increase of about 70 percent tax on petrol
 jabaki april 2014 main deazal par excise duty 3 rupee 65 paise litre thi jo aaj kii katautee ke baad bhi 12 rupee 83 paise litre he
 Today, compared to April 2014, the central government is levying about 300 per cent more tax on diesel
 1 janvari 2018 se ab tak dilli or mumbai main petrol kareeb 14 rupaya mahangaa hua he
 After today's deduction, Rs 5 will be cheaper then what a relief
 1 janvari 2018 ko mumbai main petrol 77
 87 was a liter
 31 agast ko mumbai main petrol 85 rupaya 93 paise litre tha
 Petrol 91 in Mumbai on 4 October
 34 paise litre he
 The Center, the oil companies and Maharashtra together have reduced Rs 5
 5 aktubar se mumbai main petrol 86 rupee 34 paise ho jayega
 Is 86 rupees 34 paise a liter of relief? manoranjan bharti ne ek sawaal kiya ki jab tel ke daam badhate hai tab sarkaar press conference nahin karti he
 Press conference to tell when prices will be low
 2017 se petrol deazal ke daam rose ghatane badhane lage the
 In September, many states had reduced the price of petrol diesel, but it did not benefit much
 rajasthan ne dhai rupee litre, karnataka or aandh pradesh ne 2 rupee prati litre, kerala or pashchim bengal ne 1 rupee prati litre daam ghataae the
 Then Maharashtra refused to reduce the tax and said that petrol diesel should be brought under GST
 lekin 4 aktubar ko vitt mantri ke press conference ke baad deven fadanvis ne ghoshnaa karne main deree nahin kii
 Bihar has not shown haste
 up mukhyamantri ne kaha he ki vitt mantri kaa patr milane par vichaar karenge
 Will think of other parties
 madhya pradesh, gujarat, upi, chhattisgarh, assam or tripura ne bhi dhai rupee kam kar die hai
 While Jharkhand reduced the prices of diesel by two and a half rupees but it has not reduced the prices of petrol
 kya sarkaar itnaa hi kar sakati thi, aane vaale dinon main jab daam badhenge to tab kya karegi
 There was some decision on the prices of LPG
 daam vahaan bhi bad rahe hai

 19 kilogram vaala commercial silendar bhi 7 maheenon main 336 rupaya mahangaa ho chukaa he
 a 5 kg cylinder has also become costlier by Rs 80 between April and October

 agra ke paas 910 kaa or lakhanu main 917 kaa he
 Whatever the government wants, petrol becomes 5 rupees cheaper
 sarkaar ne tel companiyon ke taraf se bhi elaan kiya ki ve ek rupee kii kami karengi
 At the time when the Finance Minister was announcing it, the stock market Sensex started falling again, which had fallen more than 800 points since morning
 dopaher teen baje hindustan petroleum, bharat petroleum, indian oil or oengisi ke share bahut tezi se gir gaye
 As soon as Finance Minister Arun Jaitley announced that the oil marketing companies would reduce the price by one and a half rupees per liter, Hindustan Petroleum's share fell from Rs 248 to Rs 194
 bharat petroleum kaa share 368 rupye se girakar 306 rupye par aa gaya
 Indian Oil shares fell from Rs 155 to Rs 129
 oengisi kaa share 180 se 163 rupye par aa gaya
 India's economic challenges have not subsided yet
 lephes company samooh kii khasta haalat ke kaaran bazaar main abhi bhi ashanka bani hui he
 Even today, the Sensex has dropped more than 870 points
 dollars ke mukaable rupaya aaj vahaan pahunchaa jahaan kabhi nahin pahunchaa tha
 One dollar was never 73 rupees 77 paise
 aaj wo bhi ho gaya
 On October 4, the rupee has weakened by 44 paise
 ek samay to 73 rupee 81 paisa tak ja pahunchaa tha
 In early August, the experts were talking about going up to Rs 74 by December, but now it is being said that the rupee can go up to 75 against a dollar at any time
 november main iran par amareeki pratibandh shuru ho rahaa he
 Then more challenges will increase
 lekin saudi arab ne kaha he ki jitna tel iran se liya jaataa he uski bharpai kar degaa
 If the Reserve Bank raises rates on Friday, then more catastrophe will occur
 home lone or mahangaa hone ja rahaa he
 The comments abhi bhi crude aayal 90 dollar prati bairal nahin hua he
 86 dollars per barrel
 2012 main petrol deazal ke daam bade jiske khilaaf bijepi ke ek pradarshan main arun jetali ne kaha tha ki jab kaccha tel 90 dollars prati bairal he to petrol 50 rupee se zyada nahin hona chahie
 The same Jaitley is now the Finance Minister
 91 rupee litre petrol ho gaya he
 The relief of Rs 5 is said to be a big relief
 puraani baton ko isliye yaad dilaanaa zaruri he taaki yaad rahe ki janata ke bich jo bolaa jaataa he wo janata yaad rakhti he
 How easy it is to say while in opposition that if the price is 90 dollars a barrel, then petrol should be 50 rupees a liter, but the price of petrol in the government did not come down even after 50 rupees when the price of crude oil fell below $ 50 a barrel
 
 sochie kitna tex diya he janata ne
 Not only this, the kind of politics related to money should also be remembered
 kis tarah se use aarthik sandarbhon se katkar sammaan or swabhimaan se jod diya gaya
 Not only did it happen before the elections and during the elections, but even after coming to the government, the Prime Minister kept linking the strengths of the rupee with respect and self-respect
 sawaal he ki ab kisase jodna chahenge
 Arun Jaitley said, 'today we decided in the interministerial discussion and sent the proposal to the Prime Minister and he accepted
 exise duty ham log dedh rupaya kam karenge
 Oil marketing company will cut one rupee in its pricing, from the center, we will give relief to the consumers immediately for two and a half rupees, the revenue department will absorb 1 in both petrol and diesel
 50 ru centre kaa jo revenue fiks hota he, crude oil kaa price fiks hota he
 The VAT of the state governments is Ed Valorim, it is in percentage, some have 31 percent and some have less
 stats kaa 29 percent he
 If the price of crude increases, the revenue of the center remains the same
 crude oil kaa daam badhane se stats kaa revenue badhata jaataa he
 i am writing to all the State Governments that the State Governments should also give relief to the people, just as Rs 2
5 lakh is being spent by the Central Government
 dhai rupye wo waite se ebzorb karen
 ' vitt mantri ne is press conference main do baat kahi
 The first is that when crude oil prices rise, the center's revenue remains the same
 rajyon kii kamai badhati he
 Why does this happen
 kyonki centre jo excise duty lagaati he vah pichley saal aktubar se abtak 19 rupee 48 paise par fiks hi he
 The earnings of the states increase because the oil companies pay VAT to the dealer at the price
 tel companiyaan jitna mahangaa tel dealer ko dengi, waite se utani hi kamai rajya sarkaron kii badhati jaaegi
 Let us tell you how much the total revenue from the petroleum sector was in the first four years of the Modi government's tenure
 custom, exise, waite, crude oil ses sahit kai prakaar ke tex se 18 lakh 23, hazaar 760 karod kama chuke hai
 Out of this, the Government of India earned 11 lakh 4 thousand 72 crore, the total income of the states was 7 lakh 19,688 crore
 ye aankade march 2018 tak ke hai
 How much would have been earned since March, based on last year's earnings, if you estimate, then you add more than 2
5 million rupees
 yani chaar saal main centre or rajyon ne petroleum padaarthon par tex lagaakar kareeb 21 lakh karod se zyada kamai he
 All these figures are from the Ministry of Petroleum
 hamaare sahyogi himanshu shekhar mishra ne petroleum mantri dharmendra pradhan ke rajyasabha main die gaye bayaan ke aadhaar par bataaya he ki april 2014 main petrol par centre kaa utpaada shulk 9 rupee 48 paise tha
 On October 4, 16 rupees is 98 paise even after deduction of two and a half rupees
 april 2014 ke hisaab se dekhen to petrol par kareeb 70 percent tex badha he
 While the excise duty on diesel in April 2014 was 3 rupees 65 paisa liter, which is 12 rupees 83 paise liter even after today's deduction

 centre, tel companiyaan or maharashtra ne milakar 5 rupee kam kiye hai
 From October 5, petrol in Mumbai will be 86 rupees 34 paise
 kya 86 rupee 34 paise litre raahat he? Manoranjan Bharti raised a question that the government does not hold press conferences when oil prices rise
 jab daam kam honge yah bataane ke liye press conference karti he
 From 2017, the prices of petrol diesel started increasing every day
 sitambar maheene main kai rajyon ne petrol deazal ke daam ghataae the magar uskaa khaas laabh nahin hua
 Rajasthan had reduced the price by Rs 2
5 per liter, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh by Rs 2 per liter, Kerala and West Bengal by Rs 1 per liter
 tab maharashtra ne tex ghataane se manaa kar diya tha or kaha tha ki petrol deazal ko jiesti ke andar laana chahie
 But Devan Fadnavis did not delay in making the announcement after the Finance Minister's press conference on 4 October
 bihar ne jaldbaazi nahin dikhaai he
 The Deputy Chief Minister has said that he would consider getting the Finance Minister's letter
 anya pakshon ke bare main sochenge
 Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, UP, Chhattisgarh, Assam and Tripura have also reduced rupees two and a half
 jabaki jharkhand ne deazal kii keemton main dhai rupee kii kami to kii magar petrol ke daam nahin ghataae hai
 Could the government have done so much, what will it do when prices rise in the coming days
 rasoi gas kii keemton ke bare main kuch faisla hua
 Prices are increasing there too

 The question is who would you like to add now
 1 janvari 2018 se ab tak dilli or mumbai main petrol kareeb 14 rupaya mahangaa hua he
 After today's deduction, Rs 5 will be cheaper then what a relief
 1 janvari 2018 ko mumbai main petrol 77
 87 was a liter
 31 agast ko mumbai main petrol 85 rupaya 93 paise litre tha
 Petrol 91 in Mumbai on 4 October
 34 paise litre he
 The Center, the oil companies and Maharashtra together have reduced Rs 5
 5 aktubar se mumbai main petrol 86 rupee 34 paise ho jayega
 Is 86 rupees 34 paise a liter of relief? manoranjan bharti ne ek sawaal kiya ki jab tel ke daam badhate hai tab sarkaar press conference nahin karti he
 Press conference to tell when prices will be low
 2017 se petrol deazal ke daam rose ghatane badhane lage the
 In September, many states had reduced the price of petrol diesel, but it did not benefit much
 rajasthan ne dhai rupee litre, karnataka or aandh pradesh ne 2 rupee prati litre, kerala or pashchim bengal ne 1 rupee prati litre daam ghataae the
 Then Maharashtra refused to reduce the tax and said that petrol diesel should be brought under GST
 lekin 4 aktubar ko vitt mantri ke press conference ke baad deven fadanvis ne ghoshnaa karne main deree nahin kii
 Bihar has not shown haste
 up mukhyamantri ne kaha he ki vitt mantri kaa patr milane par vichaar karenge
 Will think of other parties
 madhya pradesh, gujarat, upi, chhattisgarh, assam or tripura ne bhi dhai rupee kam kar die hai
 While Jharkhand reduced the prices of diesel by two and a half rupees but it has not reduced the prices of petrol
 kya sarkaar itnaa hi kar sakati thi, aane vaale dinon main jab daam badhenge to tab kya karegi
 There was some decision on the prices of LPG
 daam vahaan bhi bad rahe hai

 At the time when the Finance Minister was announcing it, the stock market Sensex started falling again, which had fallen more than 800 points since morning
 dopaher teen baje hindustan petroleum, bharat petroleum, indian oil or oengisi ke share bahut tezi se gir gaye

 bharat petroleum kaa share 368 rupye se girakar 306 rupye par aa gaya
 Indian Oil shares fell from Rs 155 to Rs 129

 India's economic challenges have not subsided yet
 lephes company samooh kii khasta haalat ke kaaran bazaar main abhi bhi ashanka bani hui he
 Even today, the Sensex has dropped more than 870 points

 The relief of Rs 5 is said to be a big relief
 puraani baton ko isliye yaad dilaanaa zaruri he taaki yaad rahe ki janata ke bich jo bolaa jaataa he wo janata yaad rakhti he
 How easy it is to say while in opposition that if the price is 90 dollars a barrel, then petrol should be 50 rupees a liter, but the price of petrol in the government did not come down even after 50 rupees when the price of crude oil fell below $ 50 a barrel
 
 sochie kitna tex diya he janata ne

 Not only did it happen before the elections and during the elections, but even after coming to the government, the Prime Minister kept linking the strengths of the rupee with respect and self-respect
 sawaal he ki ab kisase jodna chahenge
 Manoranjan Bharti raised a question that the government does not hold press conferences when oil prices rise
 jab daam kam honge yah bataane ke liye press conference karti he
 From 2017, the prices of petrol diesel started increasing every day
 sitambar maheene main kai rajyon ne petrol deazal ke daam ghataae the magar uskaa khaas laabh nahin hua
 Rajasthan had reduced the price by Rs 2
5 per liter, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh by Rs 2 per liter, Kerala and West Bengal by Rs 1 per liter
 tab maharashtra ne tex ghataane se manaa kar diya tha or kaha tha ki petrol deazal ko jiesti ke andar laana chahie
 But Devan Fadnavis did not delay in making the announcement after the Finance Minister's press conference on 4 October

 86 dollars prati bairal he
 In 2012, petrol diesel prices went up against which in a BJP demonstration, Arun Jaitley said that when crude oil is $ 90 per barrel, petrol should not be more than Rs 50
 vahi jetali ab vitt mantri hai
 91 rupees a liter of petrol
 5 rupee kii raahat ko badi raahat bataai ja rahi he
 It is important to remind the old people so that the public remembers what is spoken among the public
 kitna aasaan hota he vipaksh main rahete hue bol dena ki 90 dollars prati bairal he to petrol 50 rupee litre hona chahie magar sarkaar main aane ke petrol ke daam tab bhi 50 rupee nahin hue jab kachche tel kii keemat 50 dollars prati bairal se kam ho gai
 Think how much tax has been paid by the public
 yahi nahin rupee ko lekar jis tarah kii raajnneeti hui use bhi yaad rakhana chahie
 How he was cut off from economic contexts and connected with respect and self-respect
 chunaav se pehle or chunaav ke dauraan hi nahin hua balki sarkaar main aane ke baad bhi pradhanmantri ne rupee kii majbooton ko sammaan or swabhimaan se jodate rahe
 The question is who would you like to add now
 bharat kii aarthik chunautiyaan abhi kam nahin hui hai
 There is still apprehension in the market due to the poor condition of ILFS Company Group
 aaj bhi sensex 870 se adhik ank neeche gira he
 The rupee today reached where it had never reached against the dollar
 ek dollars kabhi bhi 73 rupee 77 paise kaa nahin hua tha
 Today that too has happened
 4 aktubar ke din rupaya 44 paise kamazor hua ha
 At one time, 73 rupees and 81 paise was reached
 agast ke shuru main jaankaar disambar tak 74 rupee tak jane kii baat kar rahe the lekin ab baat hone lagi he ki kabhi bhi ek dollars ke mukaable rupaya 75 tak ja saktaa he
 US sanctions on Iran begin in November
 tab or chunautiyaan badhengi
 But Saudi Arabia has said that the amount of oil taken from Iran will make up for it
 shuukravaar ko agar reserve bank ne rate badha die tab or tabaahi machegi

 The question is who would you like to add now
 abhi bhi crude aayal 90 dollar prati bairal nahin hua he
 86 dollars per barrel
 2012 main petrol deazal ke daam bade jiske khilaaf bijepi ke ek pradarshan main arun jetali ne kaha tha ki jab kaccha tel 90 dollars prati bairal he to petrol 50 rupee se zyada nahin hona chahie
 The same Jaitley is now the Finance Minister
 91 rupee litre petrol ho gaya he
 The relief of Rs 5 is said to be a big relief
 puraani baton ko isliye yaad dilaanaa zaruri he taaki yaad rahe ki janata ke bich jo bolaa jaataa he wo janata yaad rakhti he
 How easy it is to say while in opposition that if the price is 90 dollars a barrel, then petrol should be 50 rupees a liter, but the price of petrol in the government did not come down even after 50 rupees when the price of crude oil fell below $ 50 a barrel
 
 sochie kitna tex diya he janata ne
 Not only this, the kind of politics related to money should also be remembered
 kis tarah se use aarthik sandarbhon se katkar sammaan or swabhimaan se jod diya gaya
 Not only did it happen before the elections and during the elections, but even after coming to the government, the Prime Minister kept linking the strengths of the rupee with respect and self-respect
 sawaal he ki ab kisase jodna chahenge

 jab-tab wo hamalaa karte hai or ham, shaheedon kii ginati karte hai
 They bomb and bomb everywhere and we cover the corpses
 desh ke kai konon se khabar aati he ki unhone phir ghaat laga kar hamalaa kiya or ham bas bechaargi se afsos jataate rah jate hai
 The growing Naxalite attack in the country is the biggest threat to India in the coming times
 naksal kyon desh ke liye sabase bada khatra banataa ja rahaa he? kyon naksali hamale ko roak paanaa itnaa mushkil he? haal hi main chhattisgarh kii darabha ghati main hue naksali hamale ne beshak puure desh ko hilaa diya ho, lekin bihar, jharkhand, chhattisgarh or andhra pradesh jaise rajyon ke log aise hamalon kii aanch saalon-saal jhelte rahe hai
 In fact, the Naxals filmed a video themselves after the Naxalite attack on 21 January 2012 at the border in Palamu and Garhwa districts of Jharkhand
 is hamale main bhandaria ke thana prabharee samet police ke kul 13 jawan shahid hue the
 Everyday the villagers blocked the road by occupying the health workers in that area and the SDO, BDO, District Council President and the policemen of the area went to talk to the villagers, but during this time the Naxalites ambushed and attacked the police The vehicle became a victim of this land mine explosion
 khaas baat yah thi ki yah landmine ek pakki sadak par is baariki se lagaaya gai thi ki ise khuli nigahon se dekhnaa bhi naammumkin tha, lekin jaise hi iske upar se police kii gaadi guzari, ek joardaar dhamaake se gaadi ke parakhche ud gaye
 Similarly, people still tremble today remembering this Naxalite attack in Garhwa district of Jharkhand
 is hamale main naa sirf 13 pulisavaalon ko apni jaan se haath dhonaa padaa, balki jis khatarnaak tareeke se is vaardaat ko anjaam diya gaya, naksali hamalon kii baat chalate hi aaj bhi is land mine blast kaa zikr jarur hota he
 In this video, if you believe the voice of the record Naxalite commander, then he used full 65 kg explosive in this attack and this ammo was applied in large quantity, as soon as the police car passed over the landmine, it was in the air
 Bouncing off the top of the trees fell 25 feet away
 is dhamaake main jahaan gaadi ke purje-purje bikhar gaye, vahiin itani oonchai se neeche girane kii vajah se hi zyaadaatar pulisavaalon kii maut ho gai, lekin jo pulisavaale jakhmi hone ke baavjood batch gaye, naksaliyon ne unhen gaadi se khinch kar baahar nikaalane ke baad jangal main hi marane ke liye chhod diya
 The special thing is that the Naxalites took double advantage from this land mine attack
 awwal to unhone pulisavaalon kii jaan lekar badla lene kii baat kahi, doosraa hamale main shikaar hue javaanon ke hathiyaar bator liye
 For this, not only were the policemen and their corpses searched, but the slaves inside the car were also collected and then it came to destroy the remaining policemen's car
 is iraade se sabase ant main naksaliyon ne police kii kabad main tabdeel ho chuki gaadi ko bhi aag ke hawaale kar diya
 Now a pile of corpses had accumulated
 lihaaja, naksaliyon ne shashan tak sandesh pahunchane ke liye in laashon ko phir se sadak ke kinare tak pahunchane kaa faisla kiya
 After this, all the corpses of each one were brought to the main road, because they knew that the news of this land mine blast would reach the city quickly and its impact on governance would be doubled
 yaheen par naksaliyon ke maut kaa tandav khatm nahin hua, naksaliyon ne jharkhand main 13 police waalon kii laashen bichaane ke baad raat ke andhere main jashn manaaya

 Joe tells Bultu why she can't see him naked
 ye bilkul alag tha
 From traditional writing, so-called Tamizh and Tehzeeb
 khalis aadim, attahas se bharaa, jangal sa behad or isi vajah se behad asal artical
 The writer's name was Srimoi Piyu Kundu
 utsukata jaagi, to jaankaree jutai
 Then it was found out that these very lovers wrote Sita's curse as well
 najar ke pher se kuchhek baar gujri thi ye kitaab
 Jehan was also stuck due to the name
 magar phir baat ai gai ho gai thi
 But thanks to the article Bultu, it was a coincidence to read the book
 baharhaal, ab baat kitaab par
 Its beginnings are sensational in Indian contexts
 fifty shades of grey kii yaad dilaati
 In the morning, a woman from a lower middle class family is masturbating in her bedroom
 ek kaash si yaad se chotil ho khud ko sahalaati
 And then the hurt and sound of her husband and mother-in-law at the door
 is prastaavna ke baadapathak mira kii kahani ke behad main ghusane ko aatur ho jaataa he
 Meera, a girl from a traditional family of Gujarat
 pita se darati
 She used to cling to her mother and find her friend in brother
 magar paaramparikta ke taar tab ulajhane lagate hai, jab yahi mira apane bhai karthik ke saath deh kii shuruaati paheliyaan sulajhane kii koshish karti he
 But then an accident happens and Karthik becomes a tearful memory and clings to his sexuality, his experiences
 jab tab jonk kii tarah apane hisse kaa khun chusata
 Meera once again starts caressing life
 phir uski shaadi ho jaati he mumbai main rahane vaale ek yuvak mohan ke saath
 But even after marriage, the hiccups of Meera's world do not end
 mohan apni mahadharmik maa, bhai bansi or uski patni vrinda ke saath mumbai main rahata he
 Meera tries to make her place among these people
 lekin uskaa pati mohan to ek vicitra kism kii yon granthi kaa shikaar he
 He is ready for his physical needs
 magar mira ko vah hameshaa adhuraa atrupt hi chhod detaa he
 Physically as well as mentally
 inhen sabake bich mira ko uski saas apane guru ke hawaale kar detii he
 Here Meera gets to see a different world
 in sabake baadajab mira kii jindagi kuch patari par aati dikhti he, tabhi phir ek haadasa ho jaataa he or sab kuch ulat palat
 After this, Meera also sets out to find her happiness
 sitaj kars sirf ek aurat kii yon aakankshaon kii abhivyakti bhar nahin he
 This is the beginning of the double stance of our society
 yah kitaab kai jagah behad himmat ke saath hamaari chhadam naitikta ko ankhen tarer bayaan detii he, sawaal puuchhati he, thahaake maarthi he
 And that's why it is named Sitaj Kurs

 To get hurt apni kaamanaayon kii laash par baith jivan kii shavsaadhana karnaa
 Writer Srimoi Piyu Kundu maintains an invisible tension throughout the novel
 kendriya kirdaaron ke naam mira or mohan bhi isi kaa nateeja hai
 Apart from this, he has also succeeded in making the scene in front of the eyes physically through fine details
 pehle upanyaas ke hisaab se ye sari koshishen bilashak jabar tarif kii hakdaar hai
 Novell's language is also simple
 hindi ke pathak bhi is upanyaas ko bina hichak uthaa sakate hai
 The Asaram episode and the Mumbai floods have been put to good use in the story
 kitaab main kuch chigenour bhi behatar ho sakati thim
 For example, its length could be shortened
 uttarardh main pathak ant tak pahunchane ke liye kuch adheer ho saktaa he
 All things like contact with the guru or sex chat are part of the storyline, but sometimes they seem to be prolonged like Fifty Shades
 sitaj kars kii mira se aapako jarur milanaa chahie
 Meera, the girl around us
 paaramparik dhang se paali posi gai
 The body, love, marriage, and relationship became pensive with all the wishes and fears

 Now son, what will happen to you? '' Shiv Sena holds the yavatmal-washim Lok Sabha seat in Maharashtra
 yahaan bhaavana gavali saansad hai
 Bhavna Gawli, elected from yavatmal-washim Lok Sabha seat, is the only woman MP in Yavatmal district and has won four consecutive elections, twice from Washim Lok Sabha seat and twice from yavatmal-washim Lok Sabha seat
 is baar bhi bhaajapa-sena unhen maidan main dobaaraa utaar sakati he
 It is known that after the delimitation in 2009, Yavatmal Lok Sabha seat was divided into three parts, one part was connected with Washim district, the other from Chandrapur district and third from Hingoli district of Marathwada
 do baar washim loksabhaa seat se saansad rah chuki gavali ne parisemen ke baad washim nirvachan kshetra se yavatmal jud jane ke baavjood jeet hasil kii
 In the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, Bhavna Gawli defeated strong candidate Haribhau Rathod of Congress by 53 thousand votes
 kya rahaa he yavatmal loksabhaa seat kaa itihaas
 
 
 If we see the history of Yavatmal Lok Sabha seat, then it has been a Congress stronghold
 lekin aaj tak kendriya mantrimandal main kisi ko sthaan nahin mila
 Looking at the figures, Sahadev Bharti, who was the first MP from Yavatmal Lok Sabha seat in 1952, won the first election in 1952 and reached Parliament
 unke baad 1957 main di
 why
 gohokar (congress), 1962-1967 main devrao patil (congress), 1971 main sadashiv thakare (congress), 1977 main shridharrav jaavade chunaav jite
 After this, Uttamdada Patil (1980 to 1991) reached the Lok Sabha by winning Congress ticket continuously
 jab tutaa congress ke jeet kaa record
 
 
 Rajabhau Thackeray won the BJP for the first time in Yavatmal Lok Sabha seat
 wo 1996 main chunakar aae
 But in the next election, in 1998-1999, Uttamada Patil won
 phir 2004 main yahaan harisingh rathod ne congress ko waapas jeet dilaai
 What is the condition of Washim Lok Sabha? 
 
 yahaan 1977 main pehla loksabhaa chunaav hua
 Vasantrao Naik became MP on Congress ticket
 unke baad 1980 or 1984 main congress ke gulam nabi aaazaad, 1989-1991 main congress ke deshmukh anant raav, 1996 main pundalikar raav shivasena se, 1998 main congress ke sudhakar raav nik, phir 1999 or 2004 main shivasena kii tikat par bhaavana gavali chunaav jiti
 What is the status of assembly seats
 
 
 yavatmal-washim loksabhaa seat ke antargat 6 vidhansabha seat aati he
 These include bjp's holdings in Yavatmal, Washim, Karanja, Ralegaon
 jabaki digras main shivasena, pusad main rashtravaadi congress party kaa kabja he
 Since demonetisation, the process of recovery of new and old notes is continuing

 The police is also in a position to recover the note from an unclaimed bag
 philhal police aasapaas main lage sisitivi footage khangaal rahi he
 While people are not able to get notes even after standing in line for hours, people are shocked by the neonotmilion of 2000 from an unclaimed bag
 police ke anusaar, kavinagar sthit vivekanand nagar ilaake main ek daftar ke baahar do laavaaris bag pade hone kii soochna mili thi
 The police searched the bags reaching there
 jiske baad ek bag se police ne 2000 ke 100 note baraamad kiye

 a post shared by Voompla (@voompla) on Apr 27, 2018 at 5:53 am PDT kolkata ke vivekanand road fliover haadase main 25 logon kii maut ho gai he
 This bridge was being constructed since 2008 on the Ganesh Talkies crossing of Greater Bada Bazaar on Thursday afternoon
 6 saal main bhi yah fliover puraa nahin ho sakaa he
 It should have been built in 2012 itself, but fell before it was made in 2016
 jis bada bazaar main yah fliover ban rahaa he vahaan aam dinon main paanv rakhane kii jagah nahin hoti he
 How easy it is for a bridge to fall, it is difficult to know why it fell
 Somewhere a bridge falls like this
 ek sthaneey naagarik ne bataaya ki is pul ke neeche koi trek na ghuse isliye bairicade laga he
 Twice a month ago, the truck broke into the barricade and entered inside
 ek trek to pandrah bees foot tak andar aa gaya or ek khambhe se takaraa gaya
 Pole damaged
 usee jagah par trephic police kaa post bhi he
 So, didn't the company and administration see that the bridge could collapse
 sthaneey naagarik ne bataaya ki jahaan par pul gira he vahaan ek ajeeb sa mode banataa he
 Seeing that the design is not correct
 isliye jaruri he ki vishwasaneey tareeke se pataa lagaaya jaae ki pul kin kaarnon se gira
 Drop because of Act of Contractor or because of 'act of God'
 bachaav dal ne to kah diya ki 25 log mare hai lekin marane vaala koun tha? jo mara he ab uske parivaar kaa kya hoga? sanjay malhotra, tapan datta, aashaa joshi, edi ramjaani, gajendra sethiya, nirmal kumaar, sonia yadav, sunil vishwakarma, ranjit sahay yah naam hai un logon ke jo pul ke neeche dab kar mar gaye
 The Kolkata newspaper Sanmarg has featured about Mahadev Adak
 mahadev bada bazaar kii ek company main kaisier the
 As we left to take cash in the morning, the bridge fell
 haavda ke jagaachha thana ke baksaada ilaake ke rahane vaale the
 Who will see the arrangement of their house
 iske liye koi act aaf god hota he
 The legal language is 'act of God' but we have forgotten when and how to speak
 kolkata ke akhabaaron ke anusaar marane waalon main 3 rickshaw chaalak bhi hai
 Some are still reported missing
 shabana bano apane bachche ko skool se laane nikali thi, pul ke neeche dab gayi
 At the last moment, he also called home twice to save
 shuukravaar ko subah unka shav baahar nikaala gaya
 Kolkata Municipal Corporation and the state government get a lot of revenue from Bada Bazaar, but when you come here, you will feel that no government came here after the British left
 aam taur par aise paaramparik bazaaron kaa yahi haal hota he
 Every party's office and flag will be seen in this market
 har jagah kii tarah vyapaarik varg kaa har dal main upar tak sampark he magar ve apane hi market kaa haal thik nahin kar pate hai
 The construction and fall of this bridge are both proof of the failure of the political system
 yah pul ward number 23, 24, 25 main aata he
 23 is BJP from ward
 24 or 25 number ward se trinmul congress he
 Both the MLA and MP are from Trinamool Congress
 rabindranath tagore kaa ghar thik sau meter kii duuri par he, jahaan pul kaa hissaa gira tha
 The assembly is named after his house
 vahaan se trinmul kii vidhayak hai
 Today, Congress and BJP have alleged that one of their relatives had labor and material supply contracts for the construction of the bridge
 yah pul rajya sarkaar kii nigaraanee main jawaharlal urban mishan ke tahat ban rahaa tha
 Trinamool MP from North Kolkata, Sudeep Bandhopadhyay, has said that he had complained to the state government about the design of the bridge but by then 60 per cent had been formed
 shilanyas hua tha iskaa 2001 main, kaam shuru hua 2008 main
 Did not even make and fell in March 2016
 60 meter lanbaa pul gir jaae, jiskaa vajan 140 ton ho to sochie malbe ko hataane main kitni mashkkat kerani padi hogi
 Five thousand people including Kolkata Police, Army Jawans, NDRF, Department of Mines and Geology, Corporation Engineers have gathered
 trinmul congress ke netaa sipiem par aarope laga rahe hai
 CPM people are accusing Trinamool
 thik se jaanch ho jaae to pataa chalegaa ki pul banane vaali company ke sabase rishte hai
 The Trinamool government was in power for five years from 2011 to 2016
 koi saaf-saaf kyon nahin bataata ki kyon nahin bana? kyon nahin khatre kii ashanka ke bare main suna gaya? trinmul sarkaar ne apane hi saansad kii baat par dhyaan kyon nahin diya? If you look at this flyover properly, it will be understood that even if it were built, it would not have caused any havoc
 fliover ne tamaam shaharon ko badsoorat kar diya he
 The exact way this flyover is going through is an example of understanding what we are doing with our cities
 kisi sookhe naale kii tarah donon taraf ke makaanon se sate yah fliover bahata chalaa aa rahaa he, badrang, benur or beong
 Looking at design, it seems that engineering and design studies have stopped in India
 na samaj, na kalpana dikhti he
 Before constructing this bridge, it was not even thought about how it would affect the lives of the surrounding houses and people
 yah saare makaan saath se sattar saal puraane hai
 The thought of which great scientist to pass a two kilometer long bridge between them should be present
 pul yahaan ke makaanon ko chhukar guzar rahaa he
 So close that you can scale
 ek foot kaa bhi antar nahin he
 Even if there is an engineering failure, we will not make such a design
 kam se paanch se chah foot kaa antar to rakhega
 The houses here are passing so close that even the windows cannot open
 ab aap bataaie yah pul ban jaataa to yahaan ke makaanon par kya asar padataa
 How would the vibration of the bridge affect the houses
 duniya ke kis ejineering kalege main aisi dizine padhai jaati he ki ghar kii khidki se sataakar pul yaa haive bana do
 Can this happen only in India? Can this happen only in Kolkata? If the bridge did not fall, then the houses adjacent to it would fall on this bridge
 logon ne mukadmaa bhi kiya hua he
 Traders have also opposed this
 vampanth se lekar trinmul sarkaar ko is pul kii vicitra or khatarnaak dizine kii to jimmedaari leni hi chahie
 This flyover was not being built in any corner or side of Kolkata but is a very important place
 aasapaas aspataal hai, koching santhaan hai, fal or phool kii mandi he
 It was to end in Pushta where there is a very big house
 vahaan ke logon kaa bhi imtahaan he ki ve kaise sangathit hokar apni ladaai ladate hai
 Actually people fight but the systems beat them
 mukhyamantri mamata banerjee guuruuvaar ko dopaher se lekar raat ke ek baje tak ghatnasthal par baithkar bachaav kaary kii nigaraanee karti raheen
 All officers were present
 ghatana ke baad kii najar se dekhen to saraahneey he ki mamata banerjee sadak par baithkar sara kaam dekh rahi hai lekin yahi sakriyata pul girane se pehle ve isse judi shikayaton ke prati dikhaatin to kya yah haadasa tal nahin jaataa
 Was Mamata Banerjee or the bridge-making department fully confident of its design
 unhone to vaada kiya tha ki pul jaldi banegaa lekin kya unhone dhyaan diya tha ki pul ko lekar unke hi saansad or sthaneey log kya shikaayat kar rahe the? Now come to company inkaa naam he IVRCL
 The company is headquartered in Hyderabad
 iske paas 3000 ejeeniyar hai
 It has such a large army of engineers
 company ne apni site par likhaa he ki yah JNNURM kaa yah sabase mushkil project he
 The structure is entirely steel
 25 saal puraani yah company kai tarah ke kaarobaar se judi he
 It has many businesses including water and environment, irrigation, transportation, building and industrial structures, power supply, mining maintenance
 company neshnal stock exange or bisai main listed bhi he
 The company has contracts in Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra to Karnataka
 pul kyon gira isaki jaanch shuru ho gai he or kolkata kii police hyderabad pahunch gai he
 Even after being associated with such a big business, after the accident, the statement of this company comes that it is 'act of God'
 pul ke girane se khud god kaa mandir dhwast ho gaya he
 Not God but the verandah of Goddess Kali's temple has also fallen due to the fall of this nominal bridge
 company ke is bayaan kii insaanon kii duniya main kaaphi aalochana hui he
 God did not come clean on his act, but the company that wrapped God in this act gave a clarification in Hyderabad that there may have been a blast
 shishe toote hai
 The company was given the first deadline of 18 months to build this bridge
 67 maheene biit gaye
 While the IVRCL company blames the Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority for not delaying the delay for the delay, the Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority alleges that the company is working too slowly
 lekin abhi aarope kya he
 The allegation is not why the bridge took so long to be built
 aarope yah he ki pul kaa saath meter kaa hissaa kaise gir gaya
 How did that new part fall? darasal 2002 main hyderabad neshnal games ke liye sports village banane vaali IVRCL karzon or nuksaan se buree tarah ghiri hui he
 The company has a debt of about 10,000 crores
 2015 disambar main iskaa ghaataa 2000 karod kaa ho gaya he
 The company wanted to increase the cost of construction of the bridge
 kiskaa daawa sahi-sahi or kiskaa galat yah kahana mushkil he lekin pul girane se 25 logon ko apni jaan jarur ganvaani padi he
 8 people of the company have been arrested in Kolkata, but they should not be spared if there is a government authority responsible for delay in construction of the bridge
 tippaniyan Now come to today's question
 kya fliover itane jaruri hai ki ham kahin bhi kaise bhi bana dete hai
 If you look at flyovers across the country, then you will get many such flyovers, if made of style
 chote shaharon main kuch fliowaron ko dekhakar to ji ghabara hi jaataa he
 The problem of traffic jams is increasing everywhere
 netaa bhi logon ko aashwast karne ke liye pliover kii aadharshila rakh dete hai
 In Delhi, in the last ten-fifteen years, close to a hundred flyovers would have been built
 is shahar ke anubhav se bataa saktaa hum ki kuch fliover to kaamyaab lagate hai lekin zyaadaatar fliover ke banane ke baad bhi jam kii samasya samaapt nahin hoti he
 Talk of building 50 flyovers in Mumbai has been going on for two decades
 bengalooru main 40 fliover ban gaye hai
 There are also plenty of flyovers in Chennai
 aae din akhabaaron main fliover ke shilanyas or udghaatan kii tasviren aap dekhte rahete hai lekin kya kabhi dekha he ki inase trephic kii samasya dur hoti bhi he yaa nahin
 Apart from traffic, it is also said that the flyover also affects the surrounding social system
 paryaavaran par bhi asar hota hi hoga
 Do you also think that the traffic jam problem has ended since the flyover came
 mere khud ke anubhav main to donon hi baaten hai
 If traffic has not been resolved from Sarai Kale Khan in Delhi, then the Ghazipur flyover has solved a lot
 ek pul kaa girnaa kitna aasaan he, mushkil he to yah jaananaa ki kyon gira? kahin is tarah se koi pul girtaa he
 a local citizen reported that this barricades have been put under bridge so no truck has entered
 maheenaa bhar pehle do baar trek bairicade todakar andar ghus aayaa
 a truck then came inside for fifteen to twenty feet and crashed into a pole
 khambha kshatigrast hua
 There is also a traffic police post at the same place
 to kya company or prashasan ko yah najar nahin aayaa ki pul gir saktaa he
 The local citizen told that a strange twist takes place where the bridge has fallen
 dekhakar lagata he ki dizin sahi nahin he
 It is therefore necessary to ascertain reliably what causes the bridge to collapse
 act aaf thekedaar kii vajah se gira yaa 'act aaf god' kii vajah se
 Rescuers said that 25 people were dead, but who was to die? What will happen to the family that has died now? Sanjay Malhotra, Tapan Dutta, Asha Joshi, AD Ramjani, Gajendra Sethia, Nirmal Kumar, Sonia Yadav, Sunil Vishwakarma, Ranjit Sahai are the names of those who died under the bridge
 kolkata ke akhbaar sanhmaarg main mahadev adak ke bare main chapa he
 Mahadev was a cashier in a company of Bada Bazaar
 subah cash lene ke liye nikle hi the, pul gir gaya
 He was a resident of Baksada area of jagacha police station of Howrah
 unke ghar kaa intjaam koun dekhegaa
 There is an act of God for this
 kanoonee bhashaa he 'act aaf god' lekin ham bhul gaye hai kab kya or kaise bolnaa he
 According to Kolkata newspapers, there are 3 rickshaw drivers among those who died
 kuch abhi bhi laapata bataae ja rahe hai
 Shabana Bano had come to fetch her child from school, was buried under the bridge
 aakhri vakt main do baar ghar phone bhi kiya ki bachaa lo
 His body was taken out on Friday morning
 bada bazaar se kolkata nagar nigam or rajya sarkaar ko khub rajasav miltaa he lekin jab aap yahaan aaenge to lagegaa ki angrejon ke jane ke baad yahaan koi sarkaar ai hi nahin
 Generally, this is the case for such traditional markets
 is bazaar main har dal kaa daftar or jhanda dikhegaa
 Like everywhere, the business class has the highest contact in every party, but they are not able to fix the condition of their own market
 is pul kaa bananaa or girnaa donon hi raajnneetik vyavastha kii naakaami kaa pramaan he
 This bridge comes in ward number 23, 24, 25
 23 number ward se bijepi he
 24 and 25 are Trinamool Congress from the ward
 vidhayak or saansad donon trinmul congress se hai
 Rabindranath Tagore's house is exactly one hundred meters from where part of the bridge fell
 unheen ke ghar ke naam par vidhansabha kaa naam he
 There are Trinamool mlas
 aaj congress or bijepi ne aarope lagaaya he ki inke ek rishtedaar ke paas pul nirmaan ke liye lebar or material supplai kaa theka tha
 The bridge was being built under the Jawaharlal Urban Mission under the supervision of the state government
 uttar kolkata ke trinmul saansad sudeep bandhopadhyaay ne kaha he ki unhone rajya sarkaar se pul kii dizin kii shikaayat kii thi lekin tab tak 60 fisadi hissaa ban chukaa tha
 The foundation stone was laid in 2001, work started in 2008
 march 2016 main bhi nahin bana or gir hi gaya
 If a 60-meter-long bridge falls, weighing 140 tons, imagine how much effort it would have taken to remove debris
 kolkata police, sena ke jawan, andiaref, department aaf mins and jiyology, nigam ke ejeeniyar sahit paanch hajaar log jute hai
 Trinamool Congress leaders are accusing CPM
 sipiem vaale trinmul par aarope laga rahe hai
 If properly investigated, it will be known that the company building the bridge has the most relationships
 2011 se 2016 paanch saal tak trinmul kii sarkaar rahi
 Why doesn't anyone clearly explain why it was not made? Why has not the threat of danger been heard? Why did the Trinamool government not pay attention to its own MP? aap is fliover ko thik se dekhen to samaj main aa jayega ki yah ban bhi jaataa to kisi kahar se kam nahin hota
 The flyover has made all cities ugly
 yah fliover jis tarah se guzar rahaa he vah sateek udhaaharan he, yah samajhane kaa ki ham apane shaharon ke saath kya kar rahe hai
 Like a dry drain, this flyover adjoining the houses on both sides is flowing, Badrang, Benur and Bedrang
 dizine dekhakar lagata he bharat main ejineering or dizine kii padhai band ho gai he
 Neither understanding nor imagination can be seen
 is pul ko banane se pehle yah tak nahin sochaa gaya ki aasapaas ke makaanon or logon ke jivan par kya asar padegaa
 All these houses are sixty to seventy years old
 inke bich se do kilometre lanbaa pul gujaarne kaa khyaal kis mahaan vaigyanik kaa tha use hajir kiya janaa chahie
 The bridge is passing by touching the houses here
 itane kareeb se ki aap scale se naap sakate hai
 There is not even a foot difference
 koi ejineering fail hoga tab bhi aisi dizine nahin banayega
 Will keep a difference of at least five to six feet
 yahaan ke makaanon ke itane kareeb se guzar rahaa he ki khidkiyaan bhi nahin khul sakati hai
 Now tell me, if this bridge were built, what would be the impact on the houses here
 pul ke kampan se makaanon par kya asar padataa
 Which engineering college in the world is taught such a design that make a bridge or highway close to the window of the house
 kya yah sirf hindustan main ho saktaa he? kya yah sirf kolkata main ho saktaa he? pul nahin bhi girtaa to banane ke baad is pul par isse sate makaan gir jate
 People have also been sued
 vyapaariyon ne bhi iskaa virodh hi kiya he
 From the Left to the Trinamool Government, it must take responsibility for the bizarre and dangerous design of this bridge
 yah fliover kolkata ke kisi kone yaa kinare main nahin ban rahaa tha balki behad mahatvapurn jagah he
 There are hospitals around, coaching institutes, fruit and flower markets
 pushta main ise khatm hona tha jahaan kaaphi bada makaan he
 People there also have to test how they organize and fight their battles
 darasal log ladate hai magar vyavasthaaen unhen haraa hi detii hai
 Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee sat on the scene from noon to one o'clock on Thursday, monitoring the rescue work
 tamaam afasar maujuud the
 It is commendable to look at the aftermath of the incident that Mamata Banerjee is sitting on the road watching all the work but if she showed the same activity to the complaints related to it before the bridge collapsed, then this incident would not have been averted
 kya mamata banerjee yaa pul banane vaala vibhaag isaki dizine ko lekar puri tarah aashwast tha
 He had promised that the bridge would be built soon, but did he pay attention to what his own mps and local people were complaining about the bridge? ab aate hai company ji par
 Their name is IVRCL
 company ji kaa mukhyalay he hyderabad main
 It has 3000 engineers
 itani badi fouj he ejiniyaron kii iske paas
 The company has written on its site that this is the most difficult project of JNNURM
 puri tarah se steel kaa dhaancha he
 The 25-year-old company is involved in a variety of businesses
 jal or paryaavaran, sinchai, transportesan, building or industrial strecchar, bijli kii supplai, mining mentanence sahit kai kaarobaar hai iske
 The company is also listed on the National Stock Exchange and BSE
 andhrapradesh, madhyapradesh, maharashtra se lekar karnataka tak main is company ke paas theke hai
 An investigation into why the bridge fell has started and Kolkata Police has reached Hyderabad
 itane bade-bade kaarobaaron se jude rahane ke baad bhi haadase ke baad is company kaa bayaan aata he ki yah 'act aaf god' he
 The bridge itself has destroyed the temple of God
 god to nahin magar godes kaali ke mandir kaa baramada bhi gir gaya he is naamuraad pul ke girane se
 This statement of the company has drawn much criticism in the human world
 god kii taraf se apane act par safai to nahin ai magar god ko is act main lapetane vaali company ne hyderabad main safai di ki ho saktaa he ki dhamaakaa hua ho
 Mirrors are broken
 company ko is pul ko banane ke liye pehali dedline 18 maheene kii di gai thi
 67 months passed
 IVRCL company jahaan deree ke liye kolkata metropolitan deveopment athurity ko samay par jagah nahin dene kaa jimmedaar tehraati he vahiin kolkata metropolitan deveopment athurity kaa aarope he ki company bahut dhire kaam kar rahi he
 But what is the charge right now
 aarope yah nahin he ki pul banane main itnaa samay kyon laga
 The allegation is how the sixty meter section of the bridge collapsed
 wo bhi nayaa vaala hissaa kaise gira
 In fact, IVRCL, which formed the sports village for the Hyderabad National Games in 2002, is badly hit by debts and losses
 company par kareeb 10,000 karod kaa qarj he
 In 2015 December, its loss has been 2000 crores
 company pul ke nirmaan kii lagaat badhwaana chaahati thi
 It is difficult to say whose claims are right and what is wrong, but 25 people have lost their lives due to the fall of the bridge
 kolkata main company ke 8 logon ko giraftaar kiya gaya he, lekin agar pul banane main deree kii jimmedaar sarkari athurity hai to unhen bhi baksha nahin janaa chahie
 The comments ab aate hai aaj ke sawaal par
 Are flyovers so important that we make them anywhere
 desh bhar main fliover ko dekhenge to aapako aise bahut se fliover milenge to dhang ke bane hon
 Seeing some flyovers in small towns makes one nervous
 har jagah trephic jam kii samasya badhati ja rahi he
 Leaders also lay the foundation of the plyover to reassure the people
 dilli main jahaan pichley das-pandrah saalon main sau ke kareeb fliover to bane hi honge
 i can tell from the experience of this city that some flyovers seem successful but even after the formation of most flyovers, the problem of jam does not end
 mumbai main 50 fliover banane kii baat do dashak se chal rahi he
 There are 40 flyovers in Bengaluru
 chennai main bhi khub fliover bane hai
 You keep looking at the photographs of the foundation and inauguration of the flyover in newspapers every day, but have you ever seen whether they will solve the problem of traffic or not
 trephic ke alaava yah bhi kaha jaataa he ki fliover kii vajah se aasapaas kii saamaajik vyavastha bhi prabhavit hoti he
 The environment will also be affected
 kya aapako bhi lagata he ki fliover aane ke baad se trephic jam kii samasya samaapt ho gai he
 In my own experience both these things are there
 agar dilli ke sarai kaale khan se trephic kaa hal nahin hua he to gajipur fliover banane se kaaphi kuch hal hua he
 Rescuers said that 25 people were dead, but who was to die? What will happen to the family that has died now? Sanjay Malhotra, Tapan Dutta, Asha Joshi, AD Ramjani, Gajendra Sethia, Nirmal Kumar, Sonia Yadav, Sunil Vishwakarma, Ranjit Sahai are the names of those who died under the bridge

 Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee sat on the scene from noon to one o'clock on Thursday, monitoring the rescue work
 tamaam afasar maujuud the
 It is commendable to look at the aftermath of the incident that Mamata Banerjee is sitting on the road watching all the work but if she showed the same activity to the complaints related to it before the bridge collapsed, then this incident would not have been averted
 kya mamata banerjee yaa pul banane vaala vibhaag isaki dizine ko lekar puri tarah aashwast tha
 He had promised that the bridge would be built soon, but did he pay attention to what his own mps and local people were complaining about the bridge? ab aate hai company ji par
 Their name is IVRCL
 company ji kaa mukhyalay he hyderabad main
 It has 3000 engineers
 itani badi fouj he ejiniyaron kii iske paas
 The company has written on its site that this is the most difficult project of JNNURM
 puri tarah se steel kaa dhaancha he
 The 25-year-old company is involved in a variety of businesses
 jal or paryaavaran, sinchai, transportesan, building or industrial strecchar, bijli kii supplai, mining mentanence sahit kai kaarobaar hai iske
 The company is also listed on the National Stock Exchange and BSE
 andhrapradesh, madhyapradesh, maharashtra se lekar karnataka tak main is company ke paas theke hai
 An investigation into why the bridge fell has started and Kolkata Police has reached Hyderabad
 itane bade-bade kaarobaaron se jude rahane ke baad bhi haadase ke baad is company kaa bayaan aata he ki yah 'act aaf god' he
 The bridge itself has destroyed the temple of God
 god to nahin magar godes kaali ke mandir kaa baramada bhi gir gaya he is naamuraad pul ke girane se
 This statement of the company has drawn much criticism in the human world
 god kii taraf se apane act par safai to nahin ai magar god ko is act main lapetane vaali company ne hyderabad main safai di ki ho saktaa he ki dhamaakaa hua ho
 Mirrors are broken
 company ko is pul ko banane ke liye pehali dedline 18 maheene kii di gai thi
 67 months passed
 IVRCL company jahaan deree ke liye kolkata metropolitan deveopment athurity ko samay par jagah nahin dene kaa jimmedaar tehraati he vahiin kolkata metropolitan deveopment athurity kaa aarope he ki company bahut dhire kaam kar rahi he
 But what is the charge right now
 aarope yah nahin he ki pul banane main itnaa samay kyon laga
 The allegation is how the sixty meter section of the bridge collapsed
 wo bhi nayaa vaala hissaa kaise gira
 In fact, IVRCL, which formed the sports village for the Hyderabad National Games in 2002, is badly hit by debts and losses
 company par kareeb 10,000 karod kaa qarj he
 In 2015 December, its loss has been 2000 crores
 company pul ke nirmaan kii lagaat badhwaana chaahati thi
 It is difficult to say whose claims are right and what is wrong, but 25 people have lost their lives due to the fall of the bridge
 kolkata main company ke 8 logon ko giraftaar kiya gaya he, lekin agar pul banane main deree kii jimmedaar sarkari athurity hai to unhen bhi baksha nahin janaa chahie
 The comments ab aate hai aaj ke sawaal par
 Are flyovers so important that we make them anywhere
 desh bhar main fliover ko dekhenge to aapako aise bahut se fliover milenge to dhang ke bane hon
 Seeing some flyovers in small towns makes one nervous
 har jagah trephic jam kii samasya badhati ja rahi he
 Leaders also lay the foundation of the plyover to reassure the people
 dilli main jahaan pichley das-pandrah saalon main sau ke kareeb fliover to bane hi honge
 i can tell from the experience of this city that some flyovers seem successful but even after the formation of most flyovers, the problem of jam does not end
 mumbai main 50 fliover banane kii baat do dashak se chal rahi he
 There are 40 flyovers in Bengaluru
 chennai main bhi khub fliover bane hai
 You keep looking at the photographs of the foundation and inauguration of the flyover in newspapers every day, but have you ever seen whether they will solve the problem of traffic or not
 trephic ke alaava yah bhi kaha jaataa he ki fliover kii vajah se aasapaas kii saamaajik vyavastha bhi prabhavit hoti he
 The environment will also be affected
 kya aapako bhi lagata he ki fliover aane ke baad se trephic jam kii samasya samaapt ho gai he
 In my own experience both these things are there
 agar dilli ke sarai kaale khan se trephic kaa hal nahin hua he to gajipur fliover banane se kaaphi kuch hal hua he
 The Kolkata newspaper Sanmarg has featured about Mahadev Adak
 mahadev bada bazaar kii ek company main kaisier the
 As we left to take cash in the morning, the bridge fell
 haavda ke jagaachha thana ke baksaada ilaake ke rahane vaale the
 Who will see the arrangement of their house
 iske liye koi act aaf god hota he
 The legal language is 'act of God' but we have forgotten when and how to speak
 kolkata ke akhabaaron ke anusaar marane waalon main 3 rickshaw chaalak bhi hai
 Some are still reported missing
 shabana bano apane bachche ko skool se laane nikali thi, pul ke neeche dab gayi
 At the last moment, he also called home twice to save
 shuukravaar ko subah unka shav baahar nikaala gaya
 Kolkata Municipal Corporation and the state government get a lot of revenue from Bada Bazaar, but when you come here, you will feel that no government came here after the British left
 aam taur par aise paaramparik bazaaron kaa yahi haal hota he
 Every party's office and flag will be seen in this market
 har jagah kii tarah vyapaarik varg kaa har dal main upar tak sampark he magar ve apane hi market kaa haal thik nahin kar pate hai
 The construction and fall of this bridge are both proof of the failure of the political system
 yah pul ward number 23, 24, 25 main aata he
 23 is BJP from ward
 24 or 25 number ward se trinmul congress he
 Both the MLA and MP are from Trinamool Congress
 rabindranath tagore kaa ghar thik sau meter kii duuri par he, jahaan pul kaa hissaa gira tha
 The assembly is named after his house
 vahaan se trinmul kii vidhayak hai
 Today, Congress and BJP have alleged that one of their relatives had labor and material supply contracts for the construction of the bridge
 yah pul rajya sarkaar kii nigaraanee main jawaharlal urban mishan ke tahat ban rahaa tha
 Trinamool MP from North Kolkata, Sudeep Bandhopadhyay, has said that he had complained to the state government about the design of the bridge but by then 60 per cent had been formed
 shilanyas hua tha iskaa 2001 main, kaam shuru hua 2008 main
 Did not even make and fell in March 2016
 60 meter lanbaa pul gir jaae, jiskaa vajan 140 ton ho to sochie malbe ko hataane main kitni mashkkat kerani padi hogi
 Five thousand people including Kolkata Police, Army Jawans, NDRF, Department of Mines and Geology, Corporation Engineers have gathered
 trinmul congress ke netaa sipiem par aarope laga rahe hai
 CPM people are accusing Trinamool
 thik se jaanch ho jaae to pataa chalegaa ki pul banane vaali company ke sabase rishte hai
 The Trinamool government was in power for five years from 2011 to 2016
 koi saaf-saaf kyon nahin bataata ki kyon nahin bana? kyon nahin khatre kii ashanka ke bare main suna gaya? trinmul sarkaar ne apane hi saansad kii baat par dhyaan kyon nahin diya? If you look at this flyover properly, it will be understood that even if it were built, it would not have caused any havoc
 fliover ne tamaam shaharon ko badsoorat kar diya he
 The exact way this flyover is going through is an example of understanding what we are doing with our cities
 kisi sookhe naale kii tarah donon taraf ke makaanon se sate yah fliover bahata chalaa aa rahaa he, badrang, benur or beong
 Looking at design, it seems that engineering and design studies have stopped in India
 na samaj, na kalpana dikhti he
 Before constructing this bridge, it was not even thought about how it would affect the lives of the surrounding houses and people
 yah saare makaan saath se sattar saal puraane hai
 The thought of which great scientist to pass a two kilometer long bridge between them should be present
 pul yahaan ke makaanon ko chhukar guzar rahaa he
 So close that you can scale
 ek foot kaa bhi antar nahin he
 Even if there is an engineering failure, we will not make such a design
 kam se paanch se chah foot kaa antar to rakhega
 The houses here are passing so close that even the windows cannot open
 ab aap bataaie yah pul ban jaataa to yahaan ke makaanon par kya asar padataa
 How would the vibration of the bridge affect the houses
 duniya ke kis ejineering kalege main aisi dizine padhai jaati he ki ghar kii khidki se sataakar pul yaa haive bana do
 Can this happen only in India? Can this happen only in Kolkata? If the bridge did not fall, then the houses adjacent to it would fall on this bridge
 logon ne mukadmaa bhi kiya hua he
 Traders have also opposed this
 vampanth se lekar trinmul sarkaar ko is pul kii vicitra or khatarnaak dizine kii to jimmedaari leni hi chahie
 This flyover was not being built in any corner or side of Kolkata but is a very important place
 aasapaas aspataal hai, koching santhaan hai, fal or phool kii mandi he
 It was to end in Pushta where there is a very big house
 vahaan ke logon kaa bhi imtahaan he ki ve kaise sangathit hokar apni ladaai ladate hai
 Actually people fight but the systems beat them
 mukhyamantri mamata banerjee guuruuvaar ko dopaher se lekar raat ke ek baje tak ghatnasthal par baithkar bachaav kaary kii nigaraanee karti raheen
 All officers were present
 ghatana ke baad kii najar se dekhen to saraahneey he ki mamata banerjee sadak par baithkar sara kaam dekh rahi hai lekin yahi sakriyata pul girane se pehle ve isse judi shikayaton ke prati dikhaatin to kya yah haadasa tal nahin jaataa
 Was Mamata Banerjee or the bridge-making department fully confident of its design
 unhone to vaada kiya tha ki pul jaldi banegaa lekin kya unhone dhyaan diya tha ki pul ko lekar unke hi saansad or sthaneey log kya shikaayat kar rahe the? Now come to company inkaa naam he IVRCL
 The company is headquartered in Hyderabad
 iske paas 3000 ejeeniyar hai
 It has such a large army of engineers
 company ne apni site par likhaa he ki yah JNNURM kaa yah sabase mushkil project he
 The structure is entirely steel
 25 saal puraani yah company kai tarah ke kaarobaar se judi he
 It has many businesses including water and environment, irrigation, transportation, building and industrial structures, power supply, mining maintenance
 company neshnal stock exange or bisai main listed bhi he
 The company has contracts in Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra to Karnataka
 pul kyon gira isaki jaanch shuru ho gai he or kolkata kii police hyderabad pahunch gai he
 Even after being associated with such a big business, after the accident, the statement of this company comes that it is 'act of God'
 pul ke girane se khud god kaa mandir dhwast ho gaya he
 Not God but the verandah of Goddess Kali's temple has also fallen due to the fall of this nominal bridge
 company ke is bayaan kii insaanon kii duniya main kaaphi aalochana hui he
 God did not come clean on his act, but the company that wrapped God in this act gave a clarification in Hyderabad that there may have been a blast
 shishe toote hai
 The company was given the first deadline of 18 months to build this bridge
 67 maheene biit gaye
 While the IVRCL company blames the Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority for not delaying the delay for the delay, the Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority alleges that the company is working too slowly
 lekin abhi aarope kya he
 The allegation is not why the bridge took so long to be built
 aarope yah he ki pul kaa saath meter kaa hissaa kaise gir gaya
 How did that new part fall? darasal 2002 main hyderabad neshnal games ke liye sports village banane vaali IVRCL karzon or nuksaan se buree tarah ghiri hui he
 The company has a debt of about 10,000 crores
 2015 disambar main iskaa ghaataa 2000 karod kaa ho gaya he
 The company wanted to increase the cost of construction of the bridge
 kiskaa daawa sahi-sahi or kiskaa galat yah kahana mushkil he lekin pul girane se 25 logon ko apni jaan jarur ganvaani padi he
 8 people of the company have been arrested in Kolkata, but they should not be spared if there is a government authority responsible for delay in construction of the bridge
 tippaniyan Now come to today's question
 kya fliover itane jaruri hai ki ham kahin bhi kaise bhi bana dete hai
 If you look at flyovers across the country, then you will get many such flyovers, if made of style
 chote shaharon main kuch fliowaron ko dekhakar to ji ghabara hi jaataa he
 The problem of traffic jams is increasing everywhere
 netaa bhi logon ko aashwast karne ke liye pliover kii aadharshila rakh dete hai
 In Delhi, in the last ten-fifteen years, close to a hundred flyovers would have been built
 is shahar ke anubhav se bataa saktaa hum ki kuch fliover to kaamyaab lagate hai lekin zyaadaatar fliover ke banane ke baad bhi jam kii samasya samaapt nahin hoti he
 Talk of building 50 flyovers in Mumbai has been going on for two decades
 bengalooru main 40 fliover ban gaye hai
 There are also plenty of flyovers in Chennai
 aae din akhabaaron main fliover ke shilanyas or udghaatan kii tasviren aap dekhte rahete hai lekin kya kabhi dekha he ki inase trephic kii samasya dur hoti bhi he yaa nahin
 Apart from traffic, it is also said that the flyover also affects the surrounding social system
 paryaavaran par bhi asar hota hi hoga
 Do you also think that the traffic jam problem has ended since the flyover came
 mere khud ke anubhav main to donon hi baaten hai
 If traffic has not been resolved from Sarai Kale Khan in Delhi, then the Ghazipur flyover has solved a lot
 shabana bano apane bachche ko skool se laane nikali thi, pul ke neeche dab gayi
 At the last moment, he also called home twice to save
 shuukravaar ko subah unka shav baahar nikaala gaya

 If traffic has not been resolved from Sarai Kale Khan in Delhi, then the Ghazipur flyover has solved a lot
 bada bazaar se kolkata nagar nigam or rajya sarkaar ko khub rajasav miltaa he lekin jab aap yahaan aaenge to lagegaa ki angrejon ke jane ke baad yahaan koi sarkaar ai hi nahin
 Generally, this is the case for such traditional markets
 is bazaar main har dal kaa daftar or jhanda dikhegaa
 Like everywhere, the business class has the highest contact in every party, but they are not able to fix the condition of their own market
 is pul kaa bananaa or girnaa donon hi raajnneetik vyavastha kii naakaami kaa pramaan he
 This bridge comes in ward number 23, 24, 25
 23 number ward se bijepi he
 24 and 25 are Trinamool Congress from the ward
 vidhayak or saansad donon trinmul congress se hai
 Rabindranath Tagore's house is exactly one hundred meters from where part of the bridge fell
 unheen ke ghar ke naam par vidhansabha kaa naam he
 There are Trinamool mlas
 aaj congress or bijepi ne aarope lagaaya he ki inke ek rishtedaar ke paas pul nirmaan ke liye lebar or material supplai kaa theka tha
 The bridge was being built under the Jawaharlal Urban Mission under the supervision of the state government
 uttar kolkata ke trinmul saansad sudeep bandhopadhyaay ne kaha he ki unhone rajya sarkaar se pul kii dizin kii shikaayat kii thi lekin tab tak 60 fisadi hissaa ban chukaa tha
 The foundation stone was laid in 2001, work started in 2008
 march 2016 main bhi nahin bana or gir hi gaya
 If a 60-meter-long bridge falls, weighing 140 tons, imagine how much effort it would have taken to remove debris
 kolkata police, sena ke jawan, andiaref, department aaf mins and jiyology, nigam ke ejeeniyar sahit paanch hajaar log jute hai
 Trinamool Congress leaders are accusing CPM
 sipiem vaale trinmul par aarope laga rahe hai
 If properly investigated, it will be known that the company building the bridge has the most relationships
 2011 se 2016 paanch saal tak trinmul kii sarkaar rahi
 Why doesn't anyone clearly explain why it was not made? Why has not the threat of danger been heard? Why did the Trinamool government not pay attention to its own MP? aap is fliover ko thik se dekhen to samaj main aa jayega ki yah ban bhi jaataa to kisi kahar se kam nahin hota
 The flyover has made all cities ugly
 yah fliover jis tarah se guzar rahaa he vah sateek udhaaharan he, yah samajhane kaa ki ham apane shaharon ke saath kya kar rahe hai
 Like a dry drain, this flyover adjoining the houses on both sides is flowing, Badrang, Benur and Bedrang
 dizine dekhakar lagata he bharat main ejineering or dizine kii padhai band ho gai he
 Neither understanding nor imagination can be seen
 is pul ko banane se pehle yah tak nahin sochaa gaya ki aasapaas ke makaanon or logon ke jivan par kya asar padegaa
 All these houses are sixty to seventy years old
 inke bich se do kilometre lanbaa pul gujaarne kaa khyaal kis mahaan vaigyanik kaa tha use hajir kiya janaa chahie
 The bridge is passing by touching the houses here
 itane kareeb se ki aap scale se naap sakate hai
 There is not even a foot difference
 koi ejineering fail hoga tab bhi aisi dizine nahin banayega
 Will keep a difference of at least five to six feet
 yahaan ke makaanon ke itane kareeb se guzar rahaa he ki khidkiyaan bhi nahin khul sakati hai
 Now tell me, if this bridge were built, what would be the impact on the houses here
 pul ke kampan se makaanon par kya asar padataa
 Which engineering college in the world is taught such a design that make a bridge or highway close to the window of the house
 kya yah sirf hindustan main ho saktaa he? kya yah sirf kolkata main ho saktaa he? pul nahin bhi girtaa to banane ke baad is pul par isse sate makaan gir jate
 People have also been sued
 vyapaariyon ne bhi iskaa virodh hi kiya he
 From the Left to the Trinamool Government, it must take responsibility for the bizarre and dangerous design of this bridge
 yah fliover kolkata ke kisi kone yaa kinare main nahin ban rahaa tha balki behad mahatvapurn jagah he
 There are hospitals around, coaching institutes, fruit and flower markets
 pushta main ise khatm hona tha jahaan kaaphi bada makaan he
 People there also have to test how they organize and fight their battles
 darasal log ladate hai magar vyavasthaaen unhen haraa hi detii hai
 Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee sat on the scene from noon to one o'clock on Thursday, monitoring the rescue work
 tamaam afasar maujuud the
 It is commendable to look at the aftermath of the incident that Mamata Banerjee is sitting on the road watching all the work but if she showed the same activity to the complaints related to it before the bridge collapsed, then this incident would not have been averted
 kya mamata banerjee yaa pul banane vaala vibhaag isaki dizine ko lekar puri tarah aashwast tha
 He had promised that the bridge would be built soon, but did he pay attention to what his own mps and local people were complaining about the bridge? ab aate hai company ji par
 Their name is IVRCL
 company ji kaa mukhyalay he hyderabad main
 It has 3000 engineers
 itani badi fouj he ejiniyaron kii iske paas
 The company has written on its site that this is the most difficult project of JNNURM
 puri tarah se steel kaa dhaancha he
 The 25-year-old company is involved in a variety of businesses
 jal or paryaavaran, sinchai, transportesan, building or industrial strecchar, bijli kii supplai, mining mentanence sahit kai kaarobaar hai iske
 The company is also listed on the National Stock Exchange and BSE
 andhrapradesh, madhyapradesh, maharashtra se lekar karnataka tak main is company ke paas theke hai
 An investigation into why the bridge fell has started and Kolkata Police has reached Hyderabad
 itane bade-bade kaarobaaron se jude rahane ke baad bhi haadase ke baad is company kaa bayaan aata he ki yah 'act aaf god' he
 The bridge itself has destroyed the temple of God
 god to nahin magar godes kaali ke mandir kaa baramada bhi gir gaya he is naamuraad pul ke girane se
 This statement of the company has drawn much criticism in the human world
 god kii taraf se apane act par safai to nahin ai magar god ko is act main lapetane vaali company ne hyderabad main safai di ki ho saktaa he ki dhamaakaa hua ho
 Mirrors are broken
 company ko is pul ko banane ke liye pehali dedline 18 maheene kii di gai thi
 67 months passed
 IVRCL company jahaan deree ke liye kolkata metropolitan deveopment athurity ko samay par jagah nahin dene kaa jimmedaar tehraati he vahiin kolkata metropolitan deveopment athurity kaa aarope he ki company bahut dhire kaam kar rahi he
 But what is the charge right now
 aarope yah nahin he ki pul banane main itnaa samay kyon laga
 The allegation is how the sixty meter section of the bridge collapsed
 wo bhi nayaa vaala hissaa kaise gira
 In fact, IVRCL, which formed the sports village for the Hyderabad National Games in 2002, is badly hit by debts and losses
 company par kareeb 10,000 karod kaa qarj he
 In 2015 December, its loss has been 2000 crores
 company pul ke nirmaan kii lagaat badhwaana chaahati thi
 It is difficult to say whose claims are right and what is wrong, but 25 people have lost their lives due to the fall of the bridge
 kolkata main company ke 8 logon ko giraftaar kiya gaya he, lekin agar pul banane main deree kii jimmedaar sarkari athurity hai to unhen bhi baksha nahin janaa chahie
 The comments ab aate hai aaj ke sawaal par
 Are flyovers so important that we make them anywhere
 desh bhar main fliover ko dekhenge to aapako aise bahut se fliover milenge to dhang ke bane hon
 Seeing some flyovers in small towns makes one nervous
 har jagah trephic jam kii samasya badhati ja rahi he
 Leaders also lay the foundation of the plyover to reassure the people
 dilli main jahaan pichley das-pandrah saalon main sau ke kareeb fliover to bane hi honge
 i can tell from the experience of this city that some flyovers seem successful but even after the formation of most flyovers, the problem of jam does not end
 mumbai main 50 fliover banane kii baat do dashak se chal rahi he
 There are 40 flyovers in Bengaluru
 chennai main bhi khub fliover bane hai
 You keep looking at the photographs of the foundation and inauguration of the flyover in newspapers every day, but have you ever seen whether they will solve the problem of traffic or not
 trephic ke alaava yah bhi kaha jaataa he ki fliover kii vajah se aasapaas kii saamaajik vyavastha bhi prabhavit hoti he
 The environment will also be affected
 kya aapako bhi lagata he ki fliover aane ke baad se trephic jam kii samasya samaapt ho gai he
 In my own experience both these things are there
 agar dilli ke sarai kaale khan se trephic kaa hal nahin hua he to gajipur fliover banane se kaaphi kuch hal hua he
 This bridge comes in ward number 23, 24, 25
 23 number ward se bijepi he
 24 and 25 are Trinamool Congress from the ward
 vidhayak or saansad donon trinmul congress se hai
 Rabindranath Tagore's house is exactly one hundred meters from where part of the bridge fell
 unheen ke ghar ke naam par vidhansabha kaa naam he
 There are Trinamool mlas
 aaj congress or bijepi ne aarope lagaaya he ki inke ek rishtedaar ke paas pul nirmaan ke liye lebar or material supplai kaa theka tha
 The bridge was being built under the Jawaharlal Urban Mission under the supervision of the state government
 uttar kolkata ke trinmul saansad sudeep bandhopadhyaay ne kaha he ki unhone rajya sarkaar se pul kii dizin kii shikaayat kii thi lekin tab tak 60 fisadi hissaa ban chukaa tha
 The foundation stone was laid in 2001, work started in 2008
 march 2016 main bhi nahin bana or gir hi gaya
 If a 60-meter-long bridge falls, weighing 140 tons, imagine how much effort it would have taken to remove debris
 kolkata police, sena ke jawan, andiaref, department aaf mins and jiyology, nigam ke ejeeniyar sahit paanch hajaar log jute hai
 Trinamool Congress leaders are accusing CPM
 sipiem vaale trinmul par aarope laga rahe hai
 If properly investigated, it will be known that the company building the bridge has the most relationships
 2011 se 2016 paanch saal tak trinmul kii sarkaar rahi
 Why doesn't anyone clearly explain why it was not made? Why has not the threat of danger been heard? Why did the Trinamool government not pay attention to its own MP? aap is fliover ko thik se dekhen to samaj main aa jayega ki yah ban bhi jaataa to kisi kahar se kam nahin hota
 The flyover has made all cities ugly
 yah fliover jis tarah se guzar rahaa he vah sateek udhaaharan he, yah samajhane kaa ki ham apane shaharon ke saath kya kar rahe hai
 Like a dry drain, this flyover adjoining the houses on both sides is flowing, Badrang, Benur and Bedrang
 dizine dekhakar lagata he bharat main ejineering or dizine kii padhai band ho gai he
 Neither understanding nor imagination can be seen
 is pul ko banane se pehle yah tak nahin sochaa gaya ki aasapaas ke makaanon or logon ke jivan par kya asar padegaa
 All these houses are sixty to seventy years old
 inke bich se do kilometre lanbaa pul gujaarne kaa khyaal kis mahaan vaigyanik kaa tha use hajir kiya janaa chahie
 The bridge is passing by touching the houses here
 itane kareeb se ki aap scale se naap sakate hai
 There is not even a foot difference
 koi ejineering fail hoga tab bhi aisi dizine nahin banayega
 Will keep a difference of at least five to six feet
 yahaan ke makaanon ke itane kareeb se guzar rahaa he ki khidkiyaan bhi nahin khul sakati hai
 Now tell me, if this bridge were built, what would be the impact on the houses here
 pul ke kampan se makaanon par kya asar padataa
 Which engineering college in the world is taught such a design that make a bridge or highway close to the window of the house
 kya yah sirf hindustan main ho saktaa he? kya yah sirf kolkata main ho saktaa he? pul nahin bhi girtaa to banane ke baad is pul par isse sate makaan gir jate
 People have also been sued
 vyapaariyon ne bhi iskaa virodh hi kiya he
 From the Left to the Trinamool Government, it must take responsibility for the bizarre and dangerous design of this bridge
 yah fliover kolkata ke kisi kone yaa kinare main nahin ban rahaa tha balki behad mahatvapurn jagah he
 There are hospitals around, coaching institutes, fruit and flower markets
 pushta main ise khatm hona tha jahaan kaaphi bada makaan he
 People there also have to test how they organize and fight their battles
 darasal log ladate hai magar vyavasthaaen unhen haraa hi detii hai
 Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee sat on the scene from noon to one o'clock on Thursday, monitoring the rescue work
 tamaam afasar maujuud the
 It is commendable to look at the aftermath of the incident that Mamata Banerjee is sitting on the road watching all the work but if she showed the same activity to the complaints related to it before the bridge collapsed, then this incident would not have been averted
 kya mamata banerjee yaa pul banane vaala vibhaag isaki dizine ko lekar puri tarah aashwast tha
 He had promised that the bridge would be built soon, but did he pay attention to what his own mps and local people were complaining about the bridge? ab aate hai company ji par
 Their name is IVRCL

 It has 3000 engineers
 itani badi fouj he ejiniyaron kii iske paas
 The company has written on its site that this is the most difficult project of JNNURM

 The 25-year-old company is involved in a variety of businesses
 jal or paryaavaran, sinchai, transportesan, building or industrial strecchar, bijli kii supplai, mining mentanence sahit kai kaarobaar hai iske
 The company is also listed on the National Stock Exchange and BSE
 andhrapradesh, madhyapradesh, maharashtra se lekar karnataka tak main is company ke paas theke hai
 An investigation into why the bridge fell has started and Kolkata Police has reached Hyderabad
 itane bade-bade kaarobaaron se jude rahane ke baad bhi haadase ke baad is company kaa bayaan aata he ki yah 'act aaf god' he
 The bridge itself has destroyed the temple of God
 god to nahin magar godes kaali ke mandir kaa baramada bhi gir gaya he is naamuraad pul ke girane se
 This statement of the company has drawn much criticism in the human world
 god kii taraf se apane act par safai to nahin ai magar god ko is act main lapetane vaali company ne hyderabad main safai di ki ho saktaa he ki dhamaakaa hua ho
 Mirrors are broken
 company ko is pul ko banane ke liye pehali dedline 18 maheene kii di gai thi

 IVRCL company jahaan deree ke liye kolkata metropolitan deveopment athurity ko samay par jagah nahin dene kaa jimmedaar tehraati he vahiin kolkata metropolitan deveopment athurity kaa aarope he ki company bahut dhire kaam kar rahi he

 There are 40 flyovers in Bengaluru
 chennai main bhi khub fliover bane hai
 You keep looking at the photographs of the foundation and inauguration of the flyover in newspapers every day, but have you ever seen whether they will solve the problem of traffic or not
 trephic ke alaava yah bhi kaha jaataa he ki fliover kii vajah se aasapaas kii saamaajik vyavastha bhi prabhavit hoti he
 The environment will also be affected
 kya aapako bhi lagata he ki fliover aane ke baad se trephic jam kii samasya samaapt ho gai he
 In my own experience both these things are there
 agar dilli ke sarai kaale khan se trephic kaa hal nahin hua he to gajipur fliover banane se kaaphi kuch hal hua he
 If you look at this flyover properly, it will be understood that even if it were built, it would not have caused any havoc
 fliover ne tamaam shaharon ko badsoorat kar diya he
 The exact way this flyover is going through is an example of understanding what we are doing with our cities
 kisi sookhe naale kii tarah donon taraf ke makaanon se sate yah fliover bahata chalaa aa rahaa he, badrang, benur or beong
 Looking at design, it seems that engineering and design studies have stopped in India
 na samaj, na kalpana dikhti he
 Before constructing this bridge, it was not even thought about how it would affect the lives of the surrounding houses and people
 yah saare makaan saath se sattar saal puraane hai
 The thought of which great scientist to pass a two kilometer long bridge between them should be present
 pul yahaan ke makaanon ko chhukar guzar rahaa he
 So close that you can scale
 ek foot kaa bhi antar nahin he
 Even if there is an engineering failure, we will not make such a design
 kam se paanch se chah foot kaa antar to rakhega
 The houses here are passing so close that even the windows cannot open
 ab aap bataaie yah pul ban jaataa to yahaan ke makaanon par kya asar padataa
 How would the vibration of the bridge affect the houses
 duniya ke kis ejineering kalege main aisi dizine padhai jaati he ki ghar kii khidki se sataakar pul yaa haive bana do
 Can this happen only in India? Can this happen only in Kolkata? If the bridge did not fall, then the houses adjacent to it would fall on this bridge
 logon ne mukadmaa bhi kiya hua he
 Traders have also opposed this
 vampanth se lekar trinmul sarkaar ko is pul kii vicitra or khatarnaak dizine kii to jimmedaari leni hi chahie
 This flyover was not being built in any corner or side of Kolkata but is a very important place
 aasapaas aspataal hai, koching santhaan hai, fal or phool kii mandi he
 It was to end in Pushta where there is a very big house
 vahaan ke logon kaa bhi imtahaan he ki ve kaise sangathit hokar apni ladaai ladate hai
 Actually people fight but the systems beat them
 mukhyamantri mamata banerjee guuruuvaar ko dopaher se lekar raat ke ek baje tak ghatnasthal par baithkar bachaav kaary kii nigaraanee karti raheen
 All officers were present
 ghatana ke baad kii najar se dekhen to saraahneey he ki mamata banerjee sadak par baithkar sara kaam dekh rahi hai lekin yahi sakriyata pul girane se pehle ve isse judi shikayaton ke prati dikhaatin to kya yah haadasa tal nahin jaataa
 Was Mamata Banerjee or the bridge-making department fully confident of its design
 unhone to vaada kiya tha ki pul jaldi banegaa lekin kya unhone dhyaan diya tha ki pul ko lekar unke hi saansad or sthaneey log kya shikaayat kar rahe the? Now come to company inkaa naam he IVRCL
 The company is headquartered in Hyderabad
 iske paas 3000 ejeeniyar hai
 It has such a large army of engineers
 company ne apni site par likhaa he ki yah JNNURM kaa yah sabase mushkil project he
 The structure is entirely steel
 25 saal puraani yah company kai tarah ke kaarobaar se judi he
 It has many businesses including water and environment, irrigation, transportation, building and industrial structures, power supply, mining maintenance
 company neshnal stock exange or bisai main listed bhi he
 The company has contracts in Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra to Karnataka
 pul kyon gira isaki jaanch shuru ho gai he or kolkata kii police hyderabad pahunch gai he
 Even after being associated with such a big business, after the accident, the statement of this company comes that it is 'act of God'
 pul ke girane se khud god kaa mandir dhwast ho gaya he
 Not God but the verandah of Goddess Kali's temple has also fallen due to the fall of this nominal bridge
 company ke is bayaan kii insaanon kii duniya main kaaphi aalochana hui he
 God did not come clean on his act, but the company that wrapped God in this act gave a clarification in Hyderabad that there may have been a blast
 shishe toote hai
 The company was given the first deadline of 18 months to build this bridge
 67 maheene biit gaye
 While the IVRCL company blames the Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority for not delaying the delay for the delay, the Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority alleges that the company is working too slowly
 lekin abhi aarope kya he
 The allegation is not why the bridge took so long to be built
 aarope yah he ki pul kaa saath meter kaa hissaa kaise gir gaya
 How did that new part fall?
