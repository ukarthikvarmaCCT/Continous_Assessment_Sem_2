 At a rally in Chhattisgarh by Narendra Modi, the Congress complained to the controversial remarks about 'bloody paw' and demanded strict action against them
 mukhya chunaav ayukta vies sanpat ko bheje patr main congress ne 'asanyamit, durbhaavnapurna or apmanjanak' tippanee karne ke liye modi ko aade haath liya
 It said that by describing the Congress hand election symbol as 'bloody paw' and 'bloodthirsty', Modi has also used derogatory language for the commission, because it contains the election symbol allotted by the commission
 party ne kaha, 'khooni panja' shabd kaa istemaal atyadhik mahatvapurn or nidanneey he tathaa iskaa prabhaav logon ko bade paimaane par congress ke khilaaf aatankit karne ke liye he
 The Congress has also sent a DVD of the speech of Modi's speech delivered at the Dongargarh rally on Thursday and a newspaper news clip to the Election Commission
 party ke bayaan main kaha gaya, unke (modi ke) dwaara prayukt bhashaa evam lahaza paroksh rup se yah dikhaata he ki unhone jaanboojhkar anuchit shabdon evam tippaniyon kaa upyog kiya
 The criticism of the Code of Conduct to which other political parties allow it is limited to the record of their policies and programs, their past actions, but their statement is not a criticism under this section
 vah anuchit bhashaa kaa istemaal kar rahe hai, jo durbhaavnapurna or apmanjanak he
 a few days before this complaint of the Congress, a complaint was made by the BJP to the Election Commission of Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi
 gauratlab he ki dilli nagar nigam chunaav main aam aadmi party apni khoi hui pratishtha ko phir hasil karne ke liye jugat laga rahi he
 Not only this, bad news is also continuously coming for the Aam Aadmi Party
 aap ke bavana vidhayak veda prakaash bijepi main shaamil ho gaye hai or alji anil baijal ne kejariwal sarkaar dwaara supreme court ke disha-nirdeshon kaa ulanghan karne par vigyaapan kaa 97 karod rupee kaa kharchaa aam aadmi party se vasuulne kaa aadesh diya he
 The Congress has finalized the names of candidates in all the seven seats between yes and no, in alliance with the Aam Aadmi Party in Delhi
 jiskaa elaan kuch der main kar diya jayega
 With this, the possibilities of an alliance between the Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party are over
 dilli congress prabharee pisi chaako ne shuukravaar ko bayaan jari kar bataaya ki congress saaton siton par akele chunaav ladegi, jisamen se chaar siten final kar di hai
 He also informed that there will be no alliance with the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)
 agar dilli main AAP aaj bhi gathbandhan ke liye taiyaar he to ham taiyaar hai, lekin baaki rajyon kii sthiti alag he
 According to the state Congress in-charge, Congress had sought 3 seats in the talks with AAP MP Sanjay Singh
 ham samjhauta chaahate the, lekin AAP peeche hat gai
 He blamed the AAP for not having an alliance between the Aam Aadmi Party and the Congress in the Lok Sabha elections
 chaako ke mutabik, AAP ne gathbandhan par practical faisla nahin liya, isliye ab congress saaton siton par chunaav ladegi
 PC Chacko, Congress: AAP wanted to have an alliance in other states also which is not practical
 Every state is different; we will announce the seats tomorrow or day after tomorrow
 If they are ready for an alliance in Delhi with Congress, we are ready even today

 qayaamat kii raat29 march, 1999 kaa din tha or yah maheene kaa aakhri brihaspativaar tha
 The heat was knocking
 yah is sijan kii aakhri party thi
 This Thursday night at the Tamerind Court Cafe was Delhi's most colorful night
 yah party do myanon main ferewel party bhi thi
 We were going to close the cafe before the four month recession season and (my husband) Georges (melhaut) had a Farewell party
 ve agali subah teen maheene ke liye canada ke liye nikalne vaale the
 Their bags were packed and the driver was about to leave at three o'clock in the morning — but it could not happen
 hamaare restaraan main duniyabar ke jane-pahachaane log aate the, kyonki yah dilli ke pehle shopping mal jaisaa bhi tha
 Anyway, it was surrounded by 2,000 years old history and is one of the oldest and attractive buildings in Delhi
 gyaarah aadhunik butiques is ilaake kii shaan main chaar chand lagaate the
 They also included an art gallery
 yahaan dilli kii behtareen kalakritiyaan thim
 And there was also the modern Temerind Court Cafe
 yahaan mehmaanon ke liye jaiz mujic se lekar behtareen videshi sangeet sunne ko miltaa or kuch mehmaan medicrenian vyanjanon kaa swaad chakhte to kuch apana hunar dikhaate
 Malini (my daughter) started the theme 'thursday Night Private Party' six or seven weeks ago at the behest of her friends
 unhone malini se jor dekar kaha tha ki vah hafte main ek din unke liye rakhe or ve sab privet party kaa majaa le saken taaki ve rasukhdaar pariwaron ke yuvaaon vaale bheed bhare klbon se nijaat paa saken
 They agreed on Thursday
 yah vah raat hua karti thi jab yuva akasar hayaat hotel ke gins nitaclub jate the
 Those people could not afford the expense of going to the commodity every week, so they decided to form their own small club of best friends
 har brihaspativaar ek nayaa theme diya jaataa tha
 Everyone was forbidden to call
 xxrep 4 * us samay tak hamen sharaab kaa license nahin mila tha
 Although we received notice a few days ago that even the last hurdle has been overcome, there is 'no problem' in getting the license
 yani lambii pareshaani kaa ek daur khatm hone ja rahaa tha
 Raising the popularity of parties on Thursday night was a danger bell for us, as it was now losing the concept of 'private party'
 get par ‘privet party’ likhaa hota tha lekin is party kii charchaa hone lagi thi or is sin ko bahut hi kam log tavajjo dete the
 We also did not have much control over the entrance - only one guard lived there
 ***raat do baje se thodaa pehle, main sidhippon se neeche utarkar restaraan ke ahaate main ja rahi thi
 By the time i could get there, Malini came running, she was shivering and said, "mummy, some men have entered the restaurant and they are using abusive language
" ” usne puri baat to nahin bataai lekin thodi pareshaan jarur najar aa rahi thi
 i comforted her and said, "I am going there
" main abhi sabko baahar nikaalati hum
 Malini later said in her statement to the police that a man (later identified as Siddharth Vashisht alias Manu Sharma) had barged in with his friends and demanded alcohol
 sharma ne ek drink ke liye 1,000 ru
 Offered up to malini ne kaha ki restaraan ab band ho chukaa he, kuch bhi bachaa nahin he or unhen 1,000 ru
 i cannot get even a sip
 usne jawaab diya ki vah uski ek chuskee ke 1,000 ru
 Will give
 jhallai, malini restaraan se aa gai, or phir main usase mili
 (bima Ramani) These nights, Malini's designer and model friends used to work as 'celebrity bartenders'
 jesica laal unheen main se ek thi, jo us raat vahaan maujuud thi or haath banta rahi thi
 By that time, his work was over and the bar was covered
 vah malini or shayan munshi se baat kar rahi thi
 He was also present in the restaurant as a 'celebrity bartender'
 ve log kamyaabi bhari is raat par batiyaa rahe the or frij se kuch khaane ke liye dhund rahe the ki tabhi ye log aa dhamke
 i started climbing the four steps leading to the restaurant entrance
 jaise hi maine teesri seedhi par kadam rakhaa, mujhe fataak kii aawaaj sunai di
 It was like a balloon burst, i heard the sound of another burst
 is baar maine jesica ko dekha jo tab un aadamiyon se ghiri hui thi, or ab ve log baahar aa chuke the, mujhase 15 foot kii duuri par the, jesica jameen par giri hui thi
 Immediately the blue door of the kitchen near the counter opened and light-colored, short-legged young man entered the restaurant behind the counter, and came in front of me
 mujhe laga ki maine use kuch chamakili cheez jeb main daalate hue dekha he, vah pistaul ho sakati thi
 But i could not see it clearly
 maine dekha ki uske dost jaldi vahaan se nikalne kii koshish kar rahe hai, darwaja mere peeche tha, to maine baahar jane ke raste ko roak liya
 At the same time, Shayan and my electrician Shiv Das pointed to the man of that short height (manu Sharma) and said, "this is what he killed!" Everything was done in a few seconds
 main baahar jane ke pramukh daravaaje par khadi thi or meri ankhen usee par lagi thim
 i shouted to Shion, "go out and ask anyone who has a cellphone to call the police, ambulance and close hospital
 ” vah baahar bhaaga or vahaan maujuud kuch mehmaanon se bolaa, “kisi ne jesica ko goli maar di he!”***shaam ko paanch baje ham jesica kii antyeshti main shaamil hue, yah hamaare jivan ke sabase dukhad lamhon me se ek tha
 When we were returning from the cremation, someone told us that it is rumored that the killer is Manu Sharma
 ham use jaanate nahin the lekin yuvaaon main se kuch log use jaanate the
 He was the son of a powerful leader
 meraa dhyaan phir se subah kii ghatana kii ore chalaa gaya
 Manu Sharma - i had heard his name
 maine beeti raat dekha uskaa cheharaa yaad karne kii koshish kii or uskaa naam usase jodgaye kii koshish bhi kii
 From the very beginning, i understood his rude attitude, including carrying a gun
 jaahir he aisa vah netaa yaa bade kaarobaari kaa betaa hone kii vajah se kiya karata tha
 i understood that if i get a chance, i will recognize him and blame him
 use apane aparaadh kii sajaa milani hi chahie
 Georges, Malini and i had seen him clearly and also his behavior
 police ko die hamaare bayaan or sunwaayee ke samay jo hamane kaha, vah puri tarah se jo hamane dekha tha, uskaa samarthan karata tha
 Then my thoughts came back to poor Jessica
 na hi malini or na hi main uske kareebi dost the
 But we liked it
 maine echkevi main apni dukaan ke neeche uskaa chota-sa boutique shuru karne main madad kii thi
 She came to me requesting that i introduce her to the landlord
 yah pehla mauka tha, jab maine usase baat kii
 She immediately liked me
 vah bahut hi pyaari thi, or khud ko lekar kaaphi eemaandaar bhi thi
 She smiled a little and looked like she would have many friends
 hamaare bich zyada baat nahin hui, lekin uske milansaar andaaj ne mujh par gahari chhap chodi
 In the coming days, statements of several witnesses including Malini were recorded
 inamen yah jaanane kii koshish kii gai thi ki manu sharma ke chaar doston ke saath vahaan aane ke baad kya hua tha
 Manu Sharma spoke the most
 jesica, malini or shayan baat kar rahe the
 Manu and his friends entered inside at 1:50 pm
 manu drink chahta tha
 When he saw that there was nothing there, he brazenly spoke to Malini
 vah baahar chali gai or unke bare main mujhe bataane ai
 After that Manu entered through the blue door of the counter and began to rinse the fridge - it was empty, no alcohol
 vah shayan ke saath counter ke duusari ore khadaa rahaa, jahaan se usne jesica ko bulaayaa
 He said something to calm Manu
 lekin usne apni pistaul nikaal lee or is tarah kuch kaha, “ab tum mere tareeke se maanogi
 "he fired towards the ceiling, then he shot another shot very close to Jessica's forehead
 vah apane hathiyaar ko chhipate hue nile daravaaje se baahar kii ore niklaa
 During this time i stepped into the restaurant
 or jesica kii hatya karne kii vajah thi—usne use sharaab dene se inkaar kiya kyonki sharaab thi hi nahin

 jaanch-padtaal
 
 
 Eight days after the incident, the SHO came to our house at nine in the morning to take us with him to the police station
 unhone hamen bharosa dilaayaa ki kuch aupchaariktaaon ke baad hamen ghar waapas jane diya jayega
 Malini was unwell and under stress, and i was also tired of police inquiries and media investigations
 lekin esechao or unki team ne yah kehete hue vahaan se jane se inkaar diya ki ve hamen liye bina nahin jaaenge
 After reaching the police station, we were taken to a small dusty room
 usamen ek mej or do kursiyaan thim
 We were asked to sit there without saying anything
 ghante bhar baad, police afasar ek kaagaj lekar pahunchaa
 It had two paragraphs written in Hindi
 usne mujhase unke neeche dastakhat karne ke liye kaha
 i asked him to translate them
 usne kaha ki vah nahin kar saktaa
 So i refused to sign him
 usne phir se darwaja band kar diya
 Hours later, Malini's cellphone received a call from her Kolkata friend Preeti Paul
 priti televijan par ‘branking news’ item dekh rahi thi jisamen hamaare giraftaar hone kii baat kahi ja rahi thi
 Suddenly, everything cleared up
 ve hamen shuukravaar dopaher tak yaheen rakhana chaahate the taaki hamen jamaanat na mil sake or hamen weekend jail main hi gujaarna pade! ham turant harakat main aa gaye
 We called friends and asked for help
 meri vakil dost rani jethmalani mujhe bachaane ke liye aage ain or unhone apane junior vakil baldev malik ko meri madad ke liye bheja
 They came to the court, where we were taken in an open jeep
 hamaare khaas dost or rishtedaar vahaan jaruri kagajaat ke saath maujuud the
 Media cameras and reporters were also present there to report the incident
 ham courtroom kii ore gaye or ghante bhar main hamen 25,000 ru
 Everyone got bail on bond
 hamen apane passport bhi sarender karne the
 We were free to go home, but this deteriorated the taste of media and police
 badakismati se is bahucharchit ghatana kii vajah se ham log janata kii nigahon main shaq ke daayre main aa gaye the
 Our reputation as a witness was discounted, and our honesty was being doubted
 aisa lag rahaa tha ki jaise koi badi sajeesh rachi ja rahi he
 Later we were told by our lawyer that in the Hindi document we were being asked to sign, we were asked to confess some crime, we could be imprisoned after signing them

 Hearing in lower court
 
 
 maine himmat jutate hue prosicuter ke sawaalon ke jawaab die, vah police ko die bayaan se baaten nikaal rahe the
 i explained the whole incident in detail
 uske baad mujhe manu sharma ko pahchaanane or uski ore jaakar use chune ke liye kaha gaya
 As soon as i went to the defense people, i could not see Manu's face
 tabhi mujhe jaj kii aawaaj sunai di, “peeche se aage aao or apana cheharaa dikhaao
 "I just saw Manu
 in logon main sabase nate kad kaa tha, or ek lambey aadmi ke peeche se aage aayaa tha
 Now he was in the front row
 us raat jab maine pehali baar use dekha tha to vah usase ekadam alag lag rahaa tha—thodaa gaharaa rang or choti dadhi tathaa chashma bhi pahan rakhaa tha
 But it was only Manu
 bhaawanaaon se ot-prot main uski ore gai or bina hichkichaae maine use chuaa or uske baad vikaas yadav ko, jo is maamle kaa doosraa aaropee tha
 i murmured a bit but Naseem, the leading defense counsel, caught it
 bachaav paksh harakat main aa gaya or kehane laga ki mujhe pakkaa yakeen nahin he
 i protested and said that i am sure, that was it
 maine khud se sirf itnaa hi kaha tha ki iskaa luk ab kuch badal chukaa he
 However, my request to be heard was turned down
 prosicuter (lekin hycourt main uski aalochana kii gai) se safai dene ke liye nahin kaha gaya
 Instead, i was told that my testimony was complete
 iske saath hi bachaav paksh ko us raat kya hua tha, use apane dhang se bayaan karne kaa mauka haath lag gaya
 xxrep 4 * On 25 January 2002, Manu Sharma got interim bail from the High Court
 ram jethmalani unke vakil the
 a month later, the co-accused Vikas Yadav and his cousin released on bail were taken on remand for the murder of Nitish Katara, Vikas's sister's boyfriend
 11 november, 2002 ko manu kii antarim jamaanat ko hycourt ne khaarij kar diya
 Which states: “A long chain of circumstantial evidence is found, which indicates not to be innocent but to be guilty

 L
 bhayana ne bari kar diya he
 His verdict states that there is clearly a hint of George being guilty, as two witnesses have given statements that he was not in that party and is therefore found guilty of lying; Deepak Bhojwani, who identified the accused as a fake witness, was not named in the list of guests that George had prepared
 manu ko police ne fansaaya tha
 The two-pistol theory was reliable
 police ghatnaon ko vishwasaneey dhang se jodgaye main safal nahin ho saki
 Surprisingly our mouths remained open

 aarope kaa aadhaar yah tha ki number sahi nahin tha
 We were among the thousands of people who mistakenly had a fake ration book at the time (which the police call a minor offense), if that was the case, we were not the perpetrators of the crime but the victims
 doosraa aarope restaraan ke license ke liye farji dastavej dene se judaa tha
 He was on the assumption that we are the tenants of the property, but not the owner

 At the same time, actress Swara Bhaskar also made many allegations in strong words after watching the film director, Sanjay Leela Bhansali's film Padmavat
 swara ke open letters kaa jawaab raasalila ke ko-riter ne An open letter to all Vaginas tital ke saath open letters likh kar diya he
 An open letter to all the angry vaginas

 co / nwr2xtv0l1 — siddharth-garima (@kuttikalam) January 28, 2018 Bhansali's swagger, written - women don't walk around Vajaina, where Swara said, 'bhansali ji has glorified the practice of Sati and Jauhar
 swara film ke jariye striyon kii pesh hui chhavi se bahut naaraaz hai
 Women are not movable
 haa mahilaon ke paas yah ang hota he lekin unke paas or bhi bahut kuch he
 Therefore, the entire life of the people should not be spent focusing on Vajina, controlling it, protecting it, keeping its purity
 'vahiin raasalila ke ko-riter ne apane letters main jawaab dete hue sabase pehle feminism kii paribhaasha swara bhaskar ko samajhaaii he
 He then wrote that women have vagina
 yah jivan kaa rasta he kyonki vah jivan de sakati he
 a man cannot do this despite a million attempts
 aise main donon gender kii samanta ke sawaal kaa sahi jawaab mil jaataa he
 He further wrote that many actors, filmmakers and artists feel that they will show the way to the people, giving a new definition of Feminism in modern cinema
 aise main wo haal hi ke cinema main dikhaae gaye drishyon ko yadakar sach or jhooth kaa fark samaj len
 The scene of the film shows a woman wandering the streets listening to songs from an old film in the background with alcohol in hand after being cheated by her husband / boyfriend
 ye najaara vaisaa he jaisaa ki pyaar main dhokhaa khaane ke paas purush karte hai
 So do women get the right to equality by doing so? In a recent film, the daughter shares a cigarette with her father
 aisa ab tak sirf ladke hi filmon main karte najar aate hai
 This scene of the film shows Feminism
 ab baat karte hai un logon ki jo padmavat jo sochate hai padmavat ne feminism ko chalange kar diya
 Did she not find that watching the film that Rani Padmavati ordered her husband to deport him after the mistaken intentions of the Rajguru
 unhen vajaina kaa ehsaas tab hua jab rani padmavati khud apana cheharaa shishe main khilji ko dikhaane kaa nirnay leti he?unhen vajaina kaa ehsaas tab hua jab rani padmavati apane pati ko khilji ke kile se puure system ke khilaaf jaakar chhudaati he?unhen vajaina kaa ehsaas tab hua jab rani rape kii jagah aag ko chunati he
 It was his own decision despite being self-conscious
 sahi, galat strang, kamjor sab aap par he ki ab kis tarah vajaina or pennish kii paribhaasha ko gadhati hai
 Swara trolled on a letter to Bhansali, said - 3, when writing on divorce, the word "good" Feminism was sometimes misinterpreted
 iskaa galat istemaal bhi kiya gaya
 But do not forget that equalizing men, trying to be like them, is not the definition of Feminism
 ek mahila ne khud ko gulaami kii jindagi dene se zyada khud ko aag ke hawaale kar diya
 This was his own wish
 is baat ko vajaina or feminism ke naam par galat samajhnaa kahaan kii bahaduree he? is tarah to kisi mahila ke tyaag ko bhi aap apni soch se kharaab kar rahe hai
 The biggest thing is that the film tells the incident that happened during the 13th century, how can it be compared to the present? 700 years ago women chose death rather than rape
 is itihaas ko ham sabhi jaanate hai
 Even after this, if you have objections then stop watching historical films
 tathyon par aadhaarit sabase badi baat yah he ki sati pratha ek aisi parampara thi, jisamen auraton ko zyaadaatar pati ke marane ke baad jabardastee khud ko chita ke hawaale karnaa hota tha
 This has happened very rarely when a woman has accepted sati at will
 vahiin johar ek aisi pratha he jo swechha se mahilaayein chunati he
 There is no mention of coercion of Jauhar anywhere in history
 in sabake baad bhi padmavat dekhene ke baad logon ko vajaina yaad rahe to acha hoga wo iskaa power samajhen
 By writing an open letter, you have shown yourself to be an obstacle in the path of Feminism

 In a new twist in the ongoing deadlock between the opposition and the government, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Monday wrote a letter to the Public Accounts Committee of Parliament, offering that he was ready to appear before him on the 2-G spectrum allocation issue, while the BJP The committee, headed by senior leader Murali Manohar Joshi, has not ruled out the possibility of accepting the offer
 manmohan singh ne pichley saptaah congress ke mahadhiveshan ke samay yah saarvajanik ghoshnaa kii thi ki vah piesi ke samaksh pesh hone ko taiyaar hai
 Taking forward his offer, Singh wrote a letter to PAC chairman Joshi saying that if the committee decides to seek clarification from the Prime Minister, he is ready to appear before the PAC
 singh ne kaha ki haalanki unka maananaa he ki pradhanmantri ke piesi ke samaksh pesh hone kaa koi purv udhaaharan nahin rahaa he
 Senior BJP leader Joshi does not seem to be excited over the opposition's demand to set up a joint parliamentary committee on the issue
 vah pradhanmantri kii peshkash ko sweekaar karne ke prati anicchhuk prathit nahin hue
 If the PAC accepts this offer, it will be the first time that a Prime Minister will appear before this committee
 sattarudh or vipakshi dalon ke donon sadanon ke sadsy is samiti ke sadsy hai
 In this 22-member PAC, 10 mps are from Congress and DMK
 vahiin, anya sadsy anya dalon se hai jinamein sapa or basapa ke sadsy bhi shaamil hai
 It is said that in today's meeting, the Congress members insisted that the PAC should accept the Prime Minister's proposal and call him for 'consultation'
 lekin mana jaataa he ki yashavanth sinha (bhaajapa) or enke singh (jadyu) jaise gaiyr-samprag sadasyon ne niyamavali kaa hawala dete hue daawa kiya ki niyam is baat kii ijaajat nahin dete ki pradhanmantri ko samiti ke samaksh pesh hone ko kaha jaye
 While pursuing the pac's investigation, Joshi sought to know from the Comptroller and Auditor General Vinod Rai about his 2G spectrum allocation
 unhone kaha, ‘piesi ko kisi mantri ko talab karne kaa koi adhikaar nahin he
 But this case is different because the Prime Minister has offered to appear in it
 yah maamla saman karne kaa nahin he
 'joshi said that the Prime Minister has made this offer voluntarily
 unhen ab tak talab nahin kiya gaya he
 The committee will take the appropriate decision at the appropriate time to accept his offer
 is sambandh main ek niyamavali he jiskaa adhyayan kiya jaayegaa
 Singh said in his letter that he is writing this letter in view of this recent propaganda that the Prime Minister is not willing to appear before a parliamentary committee
 loksabhaa niyamavali kii niyam sankhya 99 ke anusaar, loksabhaa adhyaksh ke nirdesh ke antargat pieesi yaa prakkalan samiti kisi mantri ko nahin bula sakati
 However, the chairman of the committee can hold informal talks with a minister
 sansad ke sutron kaa kahana he ki kareeb 40 varsh pehle kendriya mantri si
 Subramaniam was asked to appear before the PAC
 iske baad niyamon main sanshodhan kar yah anivaary kar diya gaya ki kisi sansadeey samiti ke samaksh hajir hone ke liye kisi mantri ko bulaane se pehle loksabhaa adhyaksh se manjuuri lenaa jaruri hoga
 If the PAC accepts the Prime Minister's offer, then the committee head may have to consult the Lok Sabha Speaker before calling the Prime Minister
 joshi spectrum aavanton par piesi kii jaanch ko aage badhaane ke mood main najar aa rahe hai
 He, however, denied that the PAC was 'speeding up' the investigation
 ’unhone kaha, ‘ham koi jaldbaaji nahin kar rahe hai
 We are working as per schedule
 ’ jepisi kii maang par joshi ne kaha ki sarkaar kya kar sakati he or kya nahin, is par piesi tippanee nahin kar sakati
 Murali Manohar Joshi, while advancing his investigation on spectrum allocation, learned the views of the Comptroller and Auditor General Vinod Rai
 joshi ne jepisi ke mudde ke sambandh main bhaajapa kii aguwai vaale vipaksh kii ranneeti yaa sarkaar ke rukh par koi tippanee karne se saaf taur par inkaar kar diya or kaha, ‘piesi apana kaam kar rahi he
 We have nothing to do with what the opposition says and what the government maintains
 ’ek sawaal ke jawaab main joshi ne kaha ki ham kaig kii report se bandhe nahin hai
 If needed, the PAC can extend the scope of its investigation beyond the CAG report
 unhone bataaya ki samiti philhal varsh 2003 se lekar 2010 tak kii avadhi main 2-ji spectrum aavanton sambandhi nitiyon ke karyanvayan kii jaanch kar rahi he or is jaanch main keval 2009-10 kaa hi audit shaamil he
 But he clarified in response to a question that if the committee feels during the investigation, then the period from 2001 to now can also be brought under scrutiny
 gauratlab he ki varsh 2001 main centre main bhaajapa nit rajg kii sarkaar thi
 Joshi said that the PAC examines the expenditure of funds to be given to the departments of the government with the approval of Parliament
 piesi yah dekhati he ki nitigat nirnyon par amal thik tarah se hua he yaa nahin
 It is not within the scope of the PAC to investigate how the policy is framed

 uttarakhandamen ek baar phir baari barish kaa anumaan he
 The Meteorological Department has predicted severe rains across the state on July 5 and 6
 mausam vibhaag ke mutabik rajya main 7 se 13 centimetre tak barish ho sakati he
 Not only this, there is a danger of slipping of rock
 aise main mausam vibhaag ne logon ko 5 or july ko saavdhaan rahane kii salaah di he
 At the same time, due to rain, relief operations in Uttarakhand can be interrupted
 udhar, uttarakhand ke baadh se tabah kshetron se somvaar ko 200 se zyada tirthayatriyon or sthaneey logon ko bachaaya gaya jahaan 680 log abhi bhi fanse hue hai, jabaki mukhyamantri vijay bahuguna ne ghoshnaa kii ki raahat or bachaav kaary kii dekharekh karne ke liye ek vaidhanik sanstha kaa gathan kiya jayega
 Amidst conflicting numbers of people killed in the disaster, the Chief Minister said, "there is no scope for speculation on the number of casualties
" yah bade paimaane par hone vaali aapadaa he lekin meri soochna ke mutabik najar main aane vaale shavon kii sankhya 500 se 600 he
 Many bodies are buried in debris and about 3000 people are missing

 But this time the story is different and the injury is a little deeper
 pakistan main paidaa hue or paley-bade ek pakistani musalmaan kii kahani he ye
 a Pakistani Muslim who in recent times was the biggest messiah of Hindus living in Pakistan
 wo pakistan main rahane vaale hinduon or isaayiyon ko bhi insaan or insaaniyat ke chashme se dekhne laga tha
 Just because of this mistake he got such a punishment that just don't ask
 sarhad kii lakeer ke is paar bhi insaan
 Humans on the other side of the border
 insaan wo bhi karodon kii ginati main
 But do not know why and where most of the humans suddenly disappeared
 rah gaye to bas hindu or musalmaan
 But from the same hindu-muslim, a man who came back to find those missing humans again lost his own address
 julfikar shah insaaniyat ko dhundne nikle the ek aise mulk main jahaan use barason pehle gaddha khodakar dafna diya gaya
 Work was difficult and path dangerous
 julfikar dare yaa haare nahin
 Rather, while living in Pakistan, he started a jihad for minority Hindus and Christians
 jihadiyon ke mulk main ye aisa jihad tha jisamen shaamil hone waalon ko jananath kii huuron kaa laalach nahin diya gaya
 He himself came and came in such a number that even those who own the copyright of Jihad shivered
 nafrat kii buniyaad par khichi gai hindustaan or pakistan kii katili taron se nikalakar ek aisi kahani saamne ai he jo na sirf aapako hilaa kar rakh degi, balki pakistan kaa ek aisa cheharaa bhi aapako dikhaaegi
 The world has so far told you the story of the atrocities on Baloch in Pakistan
 magar aaj ham sunaayenge sindh kii wo daastaan jo khun main sani he
 It is wrapped in fear
 jinna ke mullak main jab talibaniyon ne kabza kiya to unhone sabase pehle sindh main based sindhi hinduon or isai par zulm dhaae
 Refusal to change the religion, men were shot at
 auraton kii izzat ko taar taar kiya
 The land was captured
 pakistan main jab koi inkaa purasane haal nahin tha
 Then this Pakistani Muslim supported him
 2009 se lekar 2012 tak zulfi ne sindhi hinduon or isai ko bachaane ke liye apni puri zindagi jhonk di
 He became the messiah of destitute Hindus and Christians in Pakistan by doing more than a thousand rallies in 3 years
 sindhiyon ke haq ke liye hyderabad se karachi tak raily nikaali to usamen shaamil 50 hazaar logon main se 30 hazaar hindu or 15 isai inke kadamon se kadam milaane ke liye gharon se baahar nikal aae
 The fetters of fear began to break
 is andolan kaa nateeja aana abhi baaki tha
 The Pakistani army and Hukmaran could not suppress this movement
 unhone zulfi kii awaz ko dabaa diya
 Zulfikar Shah had to bear the brunt of bolstering the voice of Pakistani Hindus and Christians
 pakistan se jabaran inhen nikaal diya gaya
 When these courtiers were staying after their death
 tab bade shaatiranaa tareeke se iesai ne inaki ragon main wo zehar ghol diya jo kabhi bhi inaki saanson ko band kar saktaa he
 People were massacred together
 ladakiyon or auraton kii izzat luti gai
 Forcible religions were converted
 jameen par kabje hue
 All this because they were all Pakistani minorities
 pakistan main hindu hona gunaah he
 Despite being a Muslim, Zulfiqar Shah is the biggest culprit of that country today
 kyonki alpsankhyakon kii awaz uthaakar inhone pakistani sena se bair liya tha
 The brunt of which they are suffering till date
 iesai ne inhen kahin kaa nahin choda he
 Even after being evicted from the country, Zulfi followed the intelligence steps where he went
 mauka milte hi inhen wo dard diya gaya jisaki koi dawa nahin he
 At the age of 40, Zulfi saw a lot
 ab maut kaa khauf bhi unhen daraata nahin he
 Their desire is that they should see the freedom of Sindh in their life
 pakistaniyon se kattarpathiyon se
 The only purpose of Zulfiqar's life is to create a Sindh that is neither Hindu nor Muslim
 usamen sirf sindhi hon
 The Sindhis living in Sindh never weighed in Hindu or Muslim scales
 unki har takalif har mushkil main sabase pehle khadey rahane waalon main the zulfi
 He was the largest leader of the Sindhis a few years ago
 jab sadak par utarate to ek awaz par hujum hota tha
 According to the Pakistani constitution, people of every religion can live in Pakistan
 rahete bhi hai
 But the rest is not known
 lekin agar in 113 pakistani hinduon kii maane to ye log vahaan har roj marate hue jite hai
 It is more or less the same for the other Hindus living there
 sindh or karachi main rahane vaale hinduon kii haalat sabase buree he
 According to the Karachi Hindu Panchayat, every month such cases arise in which girls are forcibly converted after getting robbed of their honor and married
 pakistani maanavadhikaar ayog khulaasa kar chukaa he
 Hindu girls are kidnapped
 unke saath rape kiya jaataa he or baad main kanoon se bachane ke liye yah daleel de di jaati he ki ladkee ne islam dharm kabool kar liya he
 This automatically ends the case of rape
 kyonki jis par iljaam hota he wo ladki se jabaran shaadi kar chukaa hota he
 If these 113 people are to be believed then even the courts of Pakistan do not judge with the Hindu girl or her family members
 12 yaa 13 saal kii ladki ko bhi adaalatein gharavaalon ke sangrakshan main nahin chhodtin
 The courts are also afraid of opposition from fundamentalists

 Talking to reporters in Patna, Nitish said that the Centre's decision to form NCTC is one-sided, neglecting the state government
 rajya sarkaron se salaah bhi nahin lee gai
 This is a hasty decision
 unhone kaha ki ensitisi ke gathan se iske paas aisi takatein aa jaaengi, jisase rajya sarkaar ke kaamkaaj main iskaa dakhal badhegaa
 Meanwhile, Patnaik said in a letter to the Prime Minister that his intention is not to politicize the matter, as some ministers of the central government have said
 balki unka iraadaa sirf ensitisi kaa virodh karnaa he
 He asked the Prime Minister to start talks with the states on this issue

 pradhanmantri ujjwala yojana (PMUY) modi sarkaar kii sabase mahatvakankshi or kargar yojana maani jaati he
 This scheme has changed the lives of millions of poor women of the country and they have got freedom from smokeless stove
 badale main piem modi ko garibon kaa jabardast samarthan mila he or bijepi ke duusari baar banpar siton se jeet kar satta main aane kii ek badi vajah aisi yojanaayen bhi hai
 So now everyone's eye is on this budget, especially on what gamechanger plan the poor government brings for the poor this time
 ujjwala ko vistaar dene ke liye kya kiya jayega? kya aisi koi or yojana aegi?'bajet 2019 kii vistrut kawarej ke liye yahaan clic karen'kya he ujjwala yojanapradhanmantri ujjwala yojana yani PMUY ke tahat sarkaar garibi rekha se neeche jivan yaapan karne vaale pariwaron kii mahilaon ko gharelu rasoi gas (LPG) kaa muft conection detii he
 The scheme was launched on 1 May 2016
 PMUY ke tahat 8 karod gas conection dene kaa lakshya he or ab tak kareeb 7 karod muft alpiji conection die ja chuke hai
 What can change in Ujjwala: The Ujjwala scheme of the central government has brought a lot of relief to the families of weaker sections, especially women
 ise 1 may 2016 ko uttar pradesh ke baliya main launch kiya gaya tha
 It remains to be seen what else the Finance Minister does in this? How can its scope be extended? pichley saal ke bajet main iskaa lakshya 8 karod conection kaa kiya gaya tha, is baar lakshya or badhaayaa ja saktaa he
 One complaint of this scheme is that there is a problem in getting the cylinders refilled
 ho saktaa he ki iske liye vitt mantri koi ghoshnaa karen
 In fact, under the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana, families living below the poverty line are given a support of Rs 1600 for every connection
 gas conection parivaar kii mahila sadsy ke naam par hota he
 But these poor people do not have money to fill cylinders further
 isliye kai pariwaron main gas chuulhe or silinder aise hi pade rah jate hai
 An additional provision of Rs two to three thousand crores can be made in the budget for gas connections to 100 per cent BPL families
 iske alaava sarkaar, paanch kilo ke chote silendar bhi dene kii yojana bana rahi he taaki riphiling bad sake
 The study of the Ministry of Petroleum also states that 14
 2 kilo kaa gas silendar bharwanaa garib pariwaron ke liye mahangaa pad rahaa isliye paanch kilo ke gas silendar dene kii yojana banaai ja rahi he
 It will be cheaper to fill it
 garibon ke rojgaar par dena hoga jormodi sarkaar mahilaon or khaskar garib mahilaon kii jivan sthiti sudhaarney par jor detii rahi he
 In the year 2018, the Economic Survey came out with a pink cover, which was seen as Modi government being gender sensitive
 jandhan yojana, ujjwala yojana aadi sabhi kaa sabase zyada phayda garib mahilaon ko hi mila he
 Now it is interesting to see what big scheme for poor women is brought in the budget
 yah bhi ho saktaa he ki is baar modi sarkaar garib nahin balki madhyam vargeey mahilaon, housewif ko lekar kisi badi yojana kaa elaan kare
 Or a big scheme may be announced for poor men to improve their employment and standard of living
 garibon ke rojgaar saadhan par jor dena isliye bhi jaruri he, kyonki mudra aadi yojanaon kaa laabh madhyam vargeey yuvaaon ko mil rahaa he

 Last year, Jahnavi Kapoor and Ishaan Khattar worked together in Dhadak
 marathi movie sarat kii rimek main jahnavi or ishan kii chemistry ko kaaphi pasand kiya gaya tha
 Dhadak was Jahnavi Kapoor's first film and Ishaan Khattar's second
 film hit hui or isi ke saath ishan or jahnavi kii chemistry bhi hit ho gai
 Since the release of Dhadak, the news of dating of Jahnavi Kapoor and Ishaan Khattar has hit the Bollywood corridors
 haalanki donon ek-duusare ko sirf acha dost hi bataate rahe hai
 Ishaan is often reported in media reports to visit Jahnavi Kapoor's house
 ye bhi kaha ja rahaa he ki boni kapur, ishan ko kaaphi pasand karte hai or ghar main garmjoshi se actor kaa swaagat karte hai
 Now Boney Kapoor has called all these reports wrong
 spotboy se baatcheet main boni kapur ne kaha- ''haa, jahnavi kapur or ishan khatter ne saath main ek film kii thi
 During this time both of them became good friends
 main apni beti or uski ishan se dosti kii izzat karata hum
 '' View this post on instagram❤️a post shared byishaan (@ishaankhatter) onjul 19, 2018 at 8:02 pm PDT a close aide of the Kapoor family revealed that after the release of Dhadak, Ishan Khattar never visited Jahnavi Kapoor at home did
 donon stars ke bich dosti se zyada badhkar koi doosraa rishta nahin he
 Recently it was also discussed that Karan Johar will cast the pair of Jahnavi and Ishaan in the Hindi remake of Dear Comrade
 haalanki baad main karan johar ne aisi khabaron ko galat bataaya
 On the workfront, Jahnavi Kapoor will be seen in Takht, Dostana 2, Kargil Girl and ruhi-afza
 sarkaar ne nae bhartiya passport ke bare main ghoshnaa karke vivaad ko janm de diya he
 The Ministry of External Affairs recently announced that the passport will no longer contain the last page, which contained the passport's address, the names of its parents and spouse
 jin aavedakon ke liye avrajan jaanch jaruri he yani jo dasvin kaksha paas nahin hai, unke passport kaa cover naarangi rang kaa hoga
 Apart from these, except for diplomats and officials, passports of other ordinary citizens will be blue covered
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ko is faisle ko 'pakshpatpurna maansikta' vaala bataane main do din lag gaye
 Party spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said the move has exposed the bjp's 'saffron love' and reiterated Rahul's discriminatory charge
 tel samrudh arab ke khadi deshon ko jane vaale pravasi shramik varg ke liye avrajan manjuuri aavashyak hoti he
 Former Kerala Chief Minister Oman Chandy sharply criticized the decision, saying that orange passport holders would 'meet Hikrat' along with their host
 chandi kii aalochana main koi hairaani nahin kyonki kerala kii arthvyavastha main kaaphi hissaa khadi se aae dhan kaa hota he
 Issuing orange passports is as if the government has approved foreign officials to discriminate against Indian citizens
 kerala ke mukhyamantri pinarai vijayan ne sarkaar se apane faisle ko 'durust' karne kaa aagrah karte hue kaha, ''do rang hone kii vajah se aisi sthiti paidaa ho jaaegi jisamen dasvin se kam kii shiksha waalon ko duusare darje kaa naagarik samajha jayega
 Removing the last page means that the passport will not be used as proof of address
 isaki sifarish videsh mantralay or mahila evam bal vikaas mantralay ke adhikariyon kii teen sadasyeey team ne kii thi
 Foreign Ministry officials say that according to international regulation, only machine-readable travel documents are considered authentic and all the necessary information related to international travel is on the first page
 adhikariyon ke mutabik ekal abhibhavakon, god liye bacchon or passport main apane pati kaa naam darj na karwaane kii icchhuk mahilaon ke saath bhedbhaav na ho, iske liye yah kadam uthaaya gaya he
 But there was no official response to the allegation of discrimination on the basis of the color of the passport
 videsh mantralay ke ek adhikari ne kaha ki jinke liye avrajan jaanch jaruri he, color koding se unke liye passport bananaa or use amal main laana bhi aasaan ho jayega
 However, no fixed date for issuing new passports has been announced
 par visheshgyon ko passport prakriya ko aasaan banane kaa sarkari daawa gale nahin utar rahaa
 At the same time, groups of non-resident Indians have expressed panic over the decision to remove the last page
 unhone tark diya ki videsh main bhartiya apane ghar kaa pataa jaise byore ke liye sabase vishwasaneey pramaan ke bataur passport par hi nirbhar rahete hai
 Many wondered whether the Aadhaar card would get the same official status? It is also surprising that the police investigation will be necessary to confirm the address given in the application, then why the last page cannot be continued or why it is not made optional so that the passport can be used for proof of address To be continued? However, the big concern is about the orange passport
 bhartiya gharelu naukaron or shramikon ke maanavadhikaar ke maamalon main khadi ke deshon kaa record acha nahin he
 It is being told that immigration checks and orange passports will stop human trafficking and protect workers from exploitation
 par avrajan jaanch se maanav taskari par koi asar nahin padataa
 At the same time, orange passport will convert large population of Indians going abroad into second class citizens

 (hedline ke alaava, is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he, yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he
 ) (except for the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it is published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) Sorry
 
 
 ham aapke bachche ko nahin bachaa paae, ye kehane kii himmat na to BRD medical college ke doctoron main hogi, naa hi wo ise apni jimmedaari maanate honge? 48 ghante main 30 se zyada masuumon ne dam tod diya, or mahaj 6 dinon main ye aankada 63 tak pahunch gaya
 But even now the government is engaged in lip-granddaughter, there can be no more embarrassing incident for any government
 haa
 
 
 Now, probably many officials will take measures, investigations will be set up, committees will be formed, resignations will also be done
 sambhav he, sadak par virodh se lekar candal march bhi nikaala jayega
 But what about those mothers who had brought their lamp to this murderous hospital in Gorakhpur with the hope that in a few hours, its red voice will rise, and then their lives will be illuminated
 par afsos, un maanon kii god main us bejaan maasoom ko saunp diya gaya, jis chehre ko dekhakar maa kaa kalejaa kaanp uthaa
 But what should the government do with this? Anyway, the death of the poor always remains entangled in the figures
 darasal aansuon kii pehle hi koi keemat nahin thi, or jab ye kisi garib kaa ho tab to koi dekhtaa bhi nahin, poochta bhi nahin
 Parents, uncle, tau of 63 children in Gorakhpur government hospital in last 6 days
 
 You are writing well
 lekin sach maniye unhen apane aansuon ko khud pochhna hoga, khud is dukh se nikalnaa hoga
 Because there was a lot of expectations from the government of this state, but now he is busy burying the case
 jis aspataal main lagaataar maasoom dam tod rahe the, parijan bilakh rahe the, kaiyon kii duniya hi ujaad gai, unke liye to ab BRD aspataal bas ek maut kii building banakar rah gai
 Strict action should be taken against those responsible
 lekin is laaparvaahee se yogi sarkaar apana peechha nahin chhudaa sakati he
 Even though the government now distributes Rs 69 lakh to the families of the deceased by giving a compensation of Rs 2 lakh each
 lekin oxigen supplai karne vaali company kii 69 lakh rupee vakt par naa dekar masuumon kii jindagi chin lee gai
 Perhaps, the patients' breath was still on credit in the hospital
 is ghatana ko ham laaparvaahee nahin kah sakate
 This is a heinous crime, committed intentionally, regardless of the consequences
 yahi soch dilli main ames or safadarajang aspataal ke prashasano aa jaae to kya hoga? ye sawaal bhar he, kyonki jitne bade aspataal hote hai marijon ko usase utani hi jindagi kii ummiden hoti hai
 Therefore, this will never happen in AIIMS and Safdarjung, they know their responsibility
 lekin gorakhpur ke is aspataal ne oxigen company kaa udhaar chukaane ke bajaay bacchon kii jindagi hi daanv par laga di
 In the last 6 months, the Yogi government took swift decisions to fix the system
 boojadkhaane band karne se lekar 'vande maataram' jabardasti ganvaane par puri takat jhonk di
 But this Gorakhpur incident proved that issuing a decree does not change the system
 badlaav ke liye ranneeti or use lagu karne ke liye har kadi ko behatar karne kii jarurat hoti he
 This incident is less condemned
 jimmedaari sarkari kii bhi banati he or use bina laag-lapet sweekaar bhi karnaa chahie, taaki un maanon ko pataa chale ki uske maasoom ne oxigen kii kami se nahin, sarkari system kii vajah se dam tod diya
 At the same time, the government should take such steps so that such incidents do not happen further, and this will be a true tribute to those innocent innocents

 He said that when Behenji has said that win SP, then you cannot sit at home
 unhone kaha ki ham akele ye kaam nahin kar rahe hai, balki basapa ke sabhi kaaryakarta sapa ke liye prachaar main jute hai
 Moe in Soraon area of phulpur
 anis apni motorcycle main nila jhanda lagaae hue sapa ummidavaar nagendra patel ke liye vot maang rahe hai
 They say why put sp's flag, it is their party's mark and flag
 ham to basapa kii pahchaan ke saath sapa ke liye vot maangenge
 Gorakhupar is considered a strong stronghold of the BJP
 iske baavjood sapa ummidavaar nishad patel ne bijepi pratyaashee upendra patel kii neend uda di he
 With the support of the BSP, the SP candidate is expected to penetrate the BJP fort
 kyonki sthaneey basapa netaa sapa pratyaashee ke chunaav prachaar main ghoomte hue najar aa rahe hai
 According to the Indian Express, Sanjay Pandey, president of bsp's Gorakhpur metropolis said that SP leaders had invited us to Akhilesh Yadav's rally, but we did not go there
 hamaari party pramukh ne nirdesh diya he ki ve manch ko saajha na karen balki iske bajaay jamini aadhaar par utarkar basapa kaa vot ko sapa ummidavaar ko sthanantarit kiya jaae, taaki bijepi haar sake
 He said that BSP leaders are working in different groups
 party ke kaaryakarta matadaataaon ko sapa ko samarthan dene or voton ko hastantarit karne ke liye daravaaje-daravaaje ja rahe hai
 Rajendra Kumar of Gorakhpur says that he had voted for the BSP in the last election, but this time he will vote for the SP
 kyonki mayawati ne sapa ko apana samarthan karne kaa elaan kiya he
 Explain that if Yadav, Muslim and Dalit voters are able to unite the SP on the gorakhpur-phulpur Lok Sabha seat, it will be difficult for BJP to repeat the victory

 Ever since the launch of Reliance Jio in India, big telecom companies like Airtel, Vodafone, Idea and Aircel have been continuously reducing their data and call rates
 nae packs or plan launch kiye ja rahe hai jisamen saste data or free colling kaa daawa kiya ja rahaa he
 Many of these plans are for 1 month and some for just one or two days
 kai companiyaan yugers banaae rakhane ke liye logon ko lubhaane vaale plan to launch kar rahi hai, lekin agar patal par dekhen to aapako aise koi plan nahin dikhte jo reliance jeeyo kii barabari karte hon
 Reliance Jio is failing in front of other companies
 As of 31 December, all the services of Reliance Jio are free, but currently there is no such telecom company that has given any service free to the users for at least one month
 duusari companiyon ne kehane ko to apane data rates kam kar die hai, lekin jab aap unhen yuj karenge to pehali dfa aapako baari bharkam keemat adaa karke plan lenaa hota he
 Unlimited to say but the truth is something else
 a fresh example of this is Airtel
 airtel ne ek 148 rupee kaa ek plan launch kiya he
 Under this, there will be internet based free calling for one month
 duusari taraf reliance jeeyo hajisane 149 rupee main analimitedcoling milegi jo internet besd nahin hogi
 You can guess yourself how companies are intent on fooling people in the name of unlimited calling
 data kii keemten to ghati hai, lekin isse kisko phayda ho rahaa haiske alaava vodaphone yaa airsel ke data plan le lijie
 These companies claim that the data will be given at the rate of 25 to 50 rupees per GB, but in reality it is not so
 aap jab plan lenge to pehle aapako 500 rupee 1499 rupee tak paise dene hote hai or iske baad aapako sasti keemat par data miltaa he
 If you look at this according to the annual savings, it is there, but there are many users who cannot buy the plan by paying so much money at one go
 jaahir aise plan se sirf un yugers ko phayda hota he jopahale se hi zyada paise de kar postapedplan yuj karte hai yaa mobile par maheene main 1,000 rupee se zyada kharch karte hai
 Except delhi-ncr or metro city, even in small towns and villages, people still recharge 10 and 20 rupees
 chaahe wo data ke liye ho yaa phir colling ke liye
 Separate plans according to the cities, but one of Jio's most surprising plans is that many telecom companies have launched their plans in only a few circles
 lekin jeeyo ke saath aisa nahin he
 The company has announced to bring a plan across the country
 aise main yah samaj paanaa mushkil he ki ye companiyaan sabhi yugers ke liye reliance jeeyo se muqabla karne kaa daawa kar rahi hai yaa sirf chuninda yugers ke liye

 On behalf of the central government in the demonetization case, Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi said in the Supreme Court that the central government is fully monitoring the matter
 notebandi ko lekar halaat kisi tarah bigade nahin hai
 Even no milkman or farmer has come to the Supreme Court against it
 ye sab maamla raajnneeti se prerit he
 The PM had asked for the situation to be normal by 31 December, in which there is still time
 10-15 dinon main sarkaar halaat or saamaanya karegi
 a new currency will also be added in these days
 lekin ye sari karency ek saath nahin chhaapi jaaegi jitani puraani karency band kii gai he
 So far, the old currency of about 12 lakh crores has been deposited, while the new currency of three lakh crores has been brought
 supreme court ye bhi dekhe ki kya wo sarkaar kii aarthik niti main dakhal de saktaa he yaa nahin
 The Supreme Court has prepared a list of questions after talking to everyone and said that it can start hearing in this case from January
 jarurat padi to iske liye paanch jajon kii samvidhan peeth kaa gathan kiya ja saktaa he
 Also, during the hearing on demonetisation, the Supreme Court asked the Center whether there was any record in this case? Before demonetisation, it was thought that how much currency will it return? How will a new currency be printed? Was there a plan for this? What did the government expect from the demonetization decision? sunwaayee ke dauraan supreme court ne centre se poocha tha ki kya court bank se paisa nikaalane kii koi nunatam seemaa tay kare jo puure desh main lagu ho or koi bhedbhaav naa rahe
 The government fixed a limit of 24 thousand but banks are not able to give this much to the people
 aise main limit tay kii jaae jise bank inkaar naa kar saken
 The court asked that the promise made to the people should be fulfilled
 is par atorni general (AG) se sarkaar se puch kar jawaab maanga he
 With this, the Supreme Court prepared the issues for hearing in the demonetization case, the court said that these questions will be heard only: 1
 Is the decision on demonetisation a violation of RBI Act 26 (2)? In which it is said that this can be done with the approval of the Central Board and the notes of any series can be closed
 2
 Are demonetization notifications on November 8 and beyond unconstitutional? 3
 Is the violation of fundamental rights such as Article 14 of the Constitution not given to the right to equality, and Article 19 related to freedom of doing business? 4
 The decision of demonetisation was implemented with no preparation, while neither the new currency was properly arranged nor the cash was circulated across the country? 5
 Is the right to withdraw money from banks and atms a violation of people's rights? 6 jila sahakaari bainko main puraane note jamaa karne or nae rupee nikaalane par roak sahi nahin he? 7
 koi raajnneetik party janhit ke yachika ke tahat supreme court main daakhil kar sakati he ? During the hearing, on behalf of the central government, AG Mukul Rohatgi raised the question that how can a political party like CPM file a PIL? Chief Justice Thakur said that he would also hear the case
 centre ne supreme court ko bataaya ab tak 12 lakh karod kii puraani karency jamaa ho chuki he
 p Chidambaram said that the way the arrangements are made, it is clear that it will take five months for the government to print a new currency
 supreme court notebandi maamle main ahm sunwaayee kar rahaa he
 During the last hearing, the Supreme Court had asked the government to consider the demand for cooperative banks, stating that they have not been allowed to conduct banking operations
 kooparative bainkon kii ore se kaha gaya he ki unhen banking transction kii ijaajat nahin di gai he is kaaran graahakon ko mushkil ho rahi he or jo bhi khatadharak hai unhen pareshaani kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he wo na to paise nikaal paa rahe hai or na hi jamaa kar paa rahe hai
 During the hearing, co-operative banks in Kerala and Maharashtra were told that they were unable to make payments to the account holders and were not able to pay pensions due to the lack of permission for banking operations after demonetisation
 8 se 14 november ke bich jo paise jamaa kiye gaye unke bare main kya upaay kiya jaae
 The economy related to the village has reached a high point
 is par supreme court ne atorni general se kaha he ki aap bataaen ki inhen kyon nahin dekh rahe hai
 Then the Attorney General said that his case is also being looked at but the difficulty is that the infrastructure of cooperative banks is not good
 inke paas niyamit bainkon kii tarah computerigeshan se lekar anya suvidhaayen nahin he ki jaali noton kii pahchaan ho sake or blike mani se bachaav ho sake
 In such a situation, these banks have been kept away from banking transactions for the same reason
 tippaniyan At the same time, Senior Advocate P
 presented on behalf of the petitioners
 chidambaram ne kaha ki desh bhar main 371 kooparative bank hai or is kaaran arthvyavastha par asar ho rahaa he
 Meanwhile, the Attorney General raised the issue of transfer of all the cases and said that the petitionation file is being filed in the daily demonetisation case across the country
 desh bhar main aise 70 arji daakhil ho chuke hai, supreme court main 15 argiyaan daakhil kii gai he
 In such a case, all the cases should be transferred to a High Court
 is par chif justise ties thakur ne kaha ki adaalatein hongi or maamle honge to court main log aaenge hi

 is par chif justise ties thakur ne kaha ki adaalatein hongi or maamle honge to court main log aaenge hi
 During the hearing, the Supreme Court had asked the Center whether the court should set a minimum limit for withdrawing money from the bank which is applicable across the country and there is no discrimination
 sarkaar ne 24 hajaar kii limit tay kii lekin bank logon ko itnaa bhi nahin de paa rahe
 In such a case, the limit should be set which banks cannot refuse
 court ne poocha ki logon se kiya vaayada puraa hona chahie
 On this, the Attorney General (AG) has been asked by the government and asked for the answer

 The Bombay High Court on Monday granted bail to Suraj Pancholi in the actress Zia Khanki suicide case
 jiya kii hatya ke aarope main pancholi ko pichley maheene giraftaar kiya gaya tha
 Earlier, the Sessions Court and the Magistrate Court had dismissed the bail plea of nsuraj Pancholi
 pancholi ne is faisle ko bombai hoicourt main chunauti di thi
 Significantly, 25-year-old Jia Khan committed suicide by hanging herself from a fan in her flat in the Sagar Sangeet Building of Juhu area on the night of June 3

 But the reality is that now this TV has started giving ideas to criminals
 idia bhi aise aise ki koi kabr par dance karata he, to koi mayyat par letkar saas bahu ke serial dekhtaa he
 Under the land, no one wanted to become a janaza
 zamin ke upar usee kii maut kaa jashn manaaya gaya
 Just understand that he used to give it the name of love
 maarane ke baad bhi uske janaaze se lipte rahe
 Yes, it is different that he put these people in front of his eyes
 ghar main hi kabr banaai
 He put smooth stones on it and kept talking about the heart from love in the tomb for a long time

 Swami Shraddhanand had celebrated his tomb by killing only his love
 magar wo to apni mohabbat ko hasil karne ke liye hi apane maa-baap kaa galaa dabaakar unhen 6 feet zamin ke neeche gaad aayaa tha
 Udayan broke down with love
 magar jab adaavat kii, to bas adaavat hi kii
 When killed, i realized that she was the one who died

 Put marble stones

 agar itani hi mohabbat thi to maaraa kyon
 When love comes in love, even Hakim Lukman could not cure it
 rahi sahi kasar angrezi philam or serial ne puri kar di
 It was here that Udayan came up with the idea of how to take revenge from aspiration and betray the law
 jab udayan mahaz 4 saal kaa tha
 Then Swami Shraddhanand had killed the Shakre Khalili and built his grave
 jise wo dilo jaan se chahta tha
 Who came for her leaving her four daughters and husband
 udayan ko shaq ne magar swami ko laalach ne gheraa tha
 He was more in love with Shakre Khalili than his wealth
 yadi police kii tafteesh par bharosa karen or khud uddyan ke shuruuaati bayaan ko sahi maane to chah saal pehle hi usne apane maa-baap ko maar kar unhen ghar ke bagiche main dafna diya tha
 But for the world, he was keeping both of them alive till now
 wo bhi soshal media kii madad se
 Many such posts have been found on Udayan's Facebook, in which he was still talking to his parents

 He is Shah Jahan who killed his Mumtaz and was buried in the room

 Entertainment is also a kind of genre in which you entertain people by telling a fake story

 It depends who is making the film and what are its perceptions

 After this everything is in our hands whether we want to see that film based on our perceptions or not

 sabhi padak vijeta khilaadi sonia ke ghar das janpath pahunche
 At that time Rahul Gandhi was also present, but if there was no one, then he was Suresh Kalmadi

 The BRICS (brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) member countries of the international organization have undoubtedly kept pace with the growing stature of China, but to be honest, there is a fundamental contradiction in the way of thinking of this organization
 china or rus nahin chaahate ki duniya main raajnneeti ke sansthagat dhaanche main kisi tarah kaa badlaav ho
 Their advantage is in maintaining the status quo
 duusari ore sanghathan ke baaki teen desh bharat, brazil or dakshin africa abhi us taqatvar siyaasi akhaade main ghusane ke liye sangharsh kar rahe hai
 This conflict is clearly seen in the debate about being made a permanent member of the UN Security Council
 bricks ne sanyukt raashtra ko 'zyada prabhavi, kushal or zyada pratinidhitivpurn banane ke liye’ isamen 'vyapak sudhaar’ kii baat kahi he
 However, China remains the biggest obstacle in changing the structure of the permanent membership of the Security Council
 china or rus apane vito power ke boote global nitiyon par aisa asar daal sakate hai, jiskaa brazil, bharat yaa dakshin africa sirf mansuba hi paal sakate hai
 Not surprisingly, not Jintao or Vladimir Putin, but US President Barack Obama, during his visit to New Delhi in 2010, promised India that he would help in moving towards this goal
 bricks jahaan aarthik muddon par zyada-se-zyaadajimmedaari chahta he, vahiin rajnatik or suraksha ke maamalon main koi bojh nahin lenaa chahta
 As a permanent member of the United Nations, China has failed to give a common response in any of its roles to international challenges
 vaishvik vittiya saansthanik dhaanche se asantusht hone ke baavjood bricks sadsy antarrashtriya mudra kosh or vishwa bank ke pashchimi prabhutv ko samuhik rup se chunauti dene main vifal rahe
 During the leadership transition of these institutions, no one stood out against Christine Lagarde of France and missed out on presenting a common candidate for the post of President of BRICS World Bank
 bricks jab tak vaishvik muddon par apana najariya nahin jaahir karata, vah vaishvik agenda tay karne kii raah nahin bana saktaa
 The BRICS perception of the global system is fundamentally different from the liberal view of Western countries
 vigyaan ke professor jaki laidi kii daleel ke mutabik bricks kii chintaa ''aarthik or saamaajik taur par teji se paraspar nirbhar ho rahi duniya main apane rashtriya kaary or faisle kii aazaadee banaae rakhane se judi he
 "the result is that BRICS is satisfied by speaking crudely on sensitive global issues rather than giving serious strategic options
 vaishvik netritv se pare hatakar dekhen to bricks desh apane pados main bhi leader nahin maane jate
 All countries, including China, continue to face significant challenges in their own region
 apane padosi desh ke saath china kii aakraamakata palatakar usee par waar kar rahi he, jaisaa ki purv or dakshin-purv asia main ubhar rahe china virdohi gathbandhan se jaahir ho rahaa he
 India's dominance in the South Asian landscape instills a natural resentment in the minds of its smaller neighbors
 dakshin america main brazil kaa netritv us kshetra ke anya deshon ko manjuur nahin, jaisaa ki sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad kii sthaayee sadsyta ke liye brazil kii ummidavaari ko argentina ke naamanzoor karne se saaf he
 Russia's neighboring countries still remember the behavior of the Soviets shown during the Cold War, while South Africa is lagging behind in the challenges surrounding it (such as the Libyan crisis)
 bricks ke saamne ubharta nayaa lubhaavna najaara kaaphi had tak 'post-american’ vishwa se judi charchaa se janma he, jisamen kai tippaneekaron kii daleel ke mutabik ek bahudhrurviy maanak dhaanche ke ubharne kii sambhaavna he
 Yet even if it is believed that the economy of BRICS countries will move towards development and it will be transformed into a political notion taking birth from the beginning, it is not entirely clear that it will emerge as a force on the world stage
 yah nahin kaha ja saktaa ki vaishvik vyavastha main iskaa yogadan acha hoga yaa bura
 The BRICS countries have not yet been able to create such institutions to help them strengthen and take advantage of their influence on the global stage
 agar bricks desh apni arthvyavasthaaon ko ekajute hokar chalaaen, tab bhi yah samooh us takat kii badaulat ek ekikrut rajnatik shakti nahin taiyaar kar saktaa
 In addition, China's dominance will stagger most of the BRICS countries' goals
 is gathbandhan kaa uddeshy yah dikhaanaa tha ki shakti kaa palada pashchim ke aitihaasik prabhutv se pare nae ubharate deshon kii ore jhuk rahaa he, lekin ek bahudhruviya vishwa vaisaa nahin ban rahaa jaisaa sochaa gaya tha, kyonki china takat ke palade ko apni mutthi main bharne kii koshish kar rahaa he
 The story of the rise of BRICS and the collapse of America is being exaggerated
 vaishvik raajnneeti kii jamini gaharaaiyon main uthal-puthal ke sanket dikh to rahe hai, lekin pasa kis taraf palatega, koun jane
 The result may be that BRICS remains a gimmicky structure or a name given to an investment banking analyst
 or kuch nahin

 Mannan's hostel room was also searched from where the police recovered a large number of literature (literature) which are being investigated
 aligarh muslim uniwarsitike procter mohsin khan ne bataaya ki mannaan vaani ko tatkaal prabhaav se uniwarsity se suspend kar diya gaya he
 According to Rajesh Pandey, SSP, Aligarh, who is investigating the case, the police has sent the literature recovered from Mannan's room for analysis
 police or uniwarsity ke sutron kii maane to mannaan kisi bhi sandehaaspad gatividhi main lipt nahin paaya gaya tha naa hi kisi ghatana kram main uske shaamil hone kii jaankaree thi

 iske saath hi mannaan kaa twitor acount bhi khangala ja rahaa he or un logon ke saath mannaan kii soshal media par charchaa ke hisson ko bhi baariki se dekha ja rahaa he
 The police have high hopes from those empty boxes of mobile phones recovered from Mannan Wani's room in which the phone is no longer present
 police ko ummid he ki in khaali dabbon se bada suraag haath lag saktaa he
 Troubled by the coming of the Mannan Wani case, the Aligarh police do not understand how an AK-47 reached the hands of a student studying in a higher institution like Aligarh Muslim University

 world cap semifinal main australia ko haraane kaa sahi samay he, ye kahana he team india ke visphotak ballebaaz viraat kohli kaa
 Virat Kohli has said in an interview to 'cricket Australia' before the crucial semi-final that the right time to defeat Australia has come
 darasal, world cap se pehle bhartiya team australia ke khilaaf test or vanade maichon main ek jeet ke liye taras gai thi, lekin iske baad team india ne world cap main joardaar vaapasi karte hue ab tak apane lagaataar saat match jeet liye hai
 Explaining the reason for this change in the team, Kohli says, "our bowlers have done well in World Cup matches
 hamane saat maichon main kul 70 wicket chatkaaye hai
 " kohli ne yah bhi kaha he ki agar hamaare gendbaazon kaa aisa hi pradarshan rahaa, to sidney ke semifinal main team india jeet hasil karegi
 According to Virat Kohli, a world class team like Australia can be defeated only when the bowlers of the team are in rhythm
 tej gendbaazon kii tikdi kii kamyaabi ke bare main viraat kohli ne kaha, "hamaare tej gendbaazon kaa compoger, parformens or agreshan, teenon main hamaare gendbaazon ne world cap main kamaal kiya he
 " kohli ne ye bhi kaha ki australia daure par team india ne jis tarah kaa pradarshan kiya he, use dekhte hue australian team par ek jeet banati he or semifinal muqaabala uske liye sahi vakt he
 Although Team India should win in the semi-finals, it is important for Virat Kohli to score runs with the bat as well
 pakistan ke khilaaf world cap ke pehle match main shatak banane ke baad viraat kohli world cap ke maichon main koi khaas asar nahin daal paae hai
 In such a situation, he will have to show his bat in Sydney
 kulbhushan jadhav ko pakistan konsular acces dene kii baat kahi he
 But sources are quoting from the news that two conditions have also been kept from Pakistan
 pehali ki kulbhushan jadhav se mulaakaat ke dauraan sisitivi camera laga hoga or saath hi suraksha personal bhi taiyaar honge
 While India has already made it clear that it wants to have access to the conduit and Kulbhushan Jadhav in an environment free of any kind of obstruction, that is why Pakistan did not take access when Pakistan offered the consular access last month
 Because the presence of physical touch diplomats to Pakistan glass wall, Kulbhushan Jadhav was adamant on their number etc
 konsular acces dene kii baat pakistan ke videsh mantralay kii ore se twitor par di gai thi
 Explain that this is the first time Kulbhushan Jadhav (kulbhushan Jadhav) will be given consular access after being sentenced to death by a military court in Pakistan in 2017
 pakistan ke videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa mohammad faisal ne kaha ki jadhav (49) ko 'rajanyik sambandhon par vienna kanvension, antarrashtriya nyaay adaalat (ICJ) ke faisle or pakistan ke kanoonon ke anuroop' rajanyik pahunch uplabdh karai ja rahi he
 It is worth noting that the International Court of Justice (ICJ) recently gave its verdict in the case related to Kulbhushan Jadhav, an Indian citizen
 he
 His execution was banned by the International Court of Justice
 bharat ke haq main faisla sunaate hue international court ne jadhav ko konsular acces dene kaa aadesh bhi diya tha
 Pakistan objected to this decision of the court, but the ICJ rejected it
 mek in india ke tahat semi hai speed trainon ko badhaava dene ke liye train set desh main hi banane kii railway kii koshishon ko jhatka laga he
 In order to bring a train set costing Rs 2500 crore, the Railways has taken out tenders twice in the last 2 years, but foreign companies have pulled back due to the condition of Make in India attached to this tender
 darasal railway ko raftaar dene ke iraade semodi sarkaarne videshi train sets ko daudane kii yojana banaai thi, iske liye 2015 main request for kotesan yani refcue maange gaye the
 But Japanese and American companies did not show interest in view of the terms of the tender, according to the top officials of the railway, the request for quotation has been sought twice by amending the terms but foreign companies have not taken any interest in the matter yet
 is
 lihaaja train set kaa maamla thande baste main ja chukaa he
 Actually train sets are trains that can run on both sides and can be easily run on existing rail tracks at speeds ranging from 160 kmph to 180 kmph
 rajdhani kii tarj par train set dilli-mumbai, dilli-kolakata ke bich chalaae jane kii yojana thi, yah train set 20 coach ke banane the
 While the chaircar train set was planned to run on the delhi-chandigarh, delhi-amritsar, mumbai-ahmedabad route
 yah train set 15 coach ke hone the, iske prayek coach main mini pentry car hogi
 The condition in this was that for the company which will receive the tender for train sets, it will be necessary to set up a manufacturing unit in the country so that the Make in India vision of the Modi government will also be strengthened
 gauratlab he ki train sets ke supplai agreement main inke mentinence ko 7 saal tak die jane kaa praavdhaan bhi rakhaa gaya tha
 For this, Railways had planned to buy 15 train sets through open bidding, for this, RFQ i
e
 REQUEST FOR QUALIFICATION was opened on 21 August 2015
 RFQ se pehle pre biding seshan main 25 domestic or videshi companiyon ne is tender ke liye registration karaayaa tha
 These companies include big companies like Alstom, Hitachi India Pvt Ltd, Bombadier Transportation India Pvt Ltd, Siemens, Hyundai Rotam
 RFQ kii sharton ko dekhte hue videshi companiyon ne is main koi dilchaspee nahin dikhaai
 In 2016, the Railways tried once again but despite negotiating with different companies, no one agreed to it
 videshi companiyon ne tender main dilchaspee isliye nahin dikhaai he kyonki tender kii sharton main ek shart yah bhi he ki 15 train set main se 10 train set bharat main hi banaae jane hai or iske liye yahaan par kaarkaana sthapit karnaa hoga
 The argument of foreign companies is that the condition and direction of Indian Railways is not fixed, they cannot set up a factory in India just to produce some train sets
 bhartiya railway ko iske liye zyada train set lene honge or aage ke liye bhi unako bharosa dilaanaa hoga
 Akash Saxena, son of former minister and BJP leader, has filed a lawsuit against former Uttar Pradesh minister Azam Khan for allegedly breaking the Indian Army's morale

 In Kashmir, Jharkhand, Assam, women killed the army and women were taken away by terrorists
 yah itnaa bada sandesh he jisapar puure hindustan ko sharminda hona chahie or sochna chahie ki ham puri duniya ko kya munh dikhaaenge

 yahi nahin kanoon main is tarah ke badlaav se dhandha band nahin hoga balki yah gaiyrkanoonee tareeke se chalata rahegaa
 Bharti Dey, head of All India Network of Sex Workers, says, "currently sex workers insist on condom use on their customers, but if you start punishing the customers only then it will increase our dependence on our brokers
