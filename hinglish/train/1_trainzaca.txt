 On the question of BJP leaders giving up their seats, BJP state spokesperson Satish Lakhera says that due to delimitation, leaders have to contest from other seats

 Lalit of Burari in Delhi was supposed to meet his father and meet God
 isliye wo puure parivaar ko faansee ke fande tak le gaya
 Just like this, Kanchan Singh of Sawai Madhopur was to meet Lord Shiva
 par shiv usase milane nahin aa rahe the
 That is why he decided to go to Lord Shiva himself
 or iske liye apane parivaar ke aath sadasyon ko bhi taiyaar kar liya

 usamen parivaar kaa mukhiya kanchan singh un sabhi ko bhagwaan shiv se milane kii baat kah rahaa tha
 At the same time, other members of his family also say their own things
 shiv ke upaask is parivaar kaa maananaa tha ki puja archana ke baad bhi bhagwaan ne unhen darshan nahin die
 So now they are going to meet God themselves
 iske baad ant main kanchan singh puja karata he
 And addressing Lord Shiva, he says that we are coming
 iske baad wo ek se teen ginati karata he
 And his whole family eats poisonous laddus together
 khaane ke baad pani bhi peetaa he
 The effect of poison starts to appear after some time
 ek ek kar parivaar ke saare sadsy girane lagate hai
 Meanwhile, a woman eating poison herself runs out of the house to see the dead of the family
 padosiyon ko bulaati he
 In the meantime, some die

 unhone kaha ki antarrashtriya bazaar main kachche tel ke daam kaaphi oonche str par hai

 In order to win the political bets of the Lok Sabha elections to be held in 2019, the Modi government is busy removing the anger of the farmers
 centre sarkaar ne dhan, bajra, makka, arhar, mung or raagi sahit kharif kii sabhi 14 fasalon kaa nunatam samarthan mulya (MSP ) main acha-khaasaa ijapha karke desh ke kisaanon ko bada tohfa diya he
 While this decision of PM Modi will benefit the farmers, for the BJP too, along with the Lok Sabha elections, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Tamil Nadu
 haryana, bihar, karnataka, gujarat or chhattisgarh jaise rajyon main kisaan matadaataaon ko lubhaana aasaan hoga
 Explain that farmers across the country are agitating against Modi and the state governments of the Center for their demands
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi sahit kai vipakshi netaa modi sarkaar ko kisaan virdohi sabit karne main jute hai
 Through the issue of farmers, Rahul was continuously surrounding the Modi government
 aise main modi sarkaar ke aaj ke faisle se vipaksh ke aaropon kii dhar kund hogi or party va sarkaar raahat kii saans le sakenge
 On 29 June, Prime Minister Narendra Modi met sugarcane farmers of Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Maharashtra and Karnataka
 is dauraan unhone kisaanon kii samasyaon ko dur karne kaa aashwaasan diya tha
 He had said that the minimum support price would be increased to 150 per cent on the cost of kharif crops
 isse thik ek hafte pehle unhone namo ap ke jariye kisaanon se sidhi baat kii thi
 In the cabinet meeting held today by the Modi government, the MSP of paddy farmers has been increased by Rs 200 under the MSP increase on kharif crops
 iske pehle dhan kii emspi main ek saal main record badhat 155 rupee prati quintal kii hui thi jo ek dashak pehle 2008-09 main upie sarkaar dwaara kii gai thi
 That is, the increase of Rs 200 by the Modi government will be the biggest increase so far
 khaas baat ye he ki manmohan sarkaar ne bhi upie-1 ke apane pehle kaarykaal ke aakhri saal main hi emspi main badhotaree kii or agle saal chunaav main jamkar vot batore, modi sarkaar ne bhi kam se kam time ke hisaab se vahi formula apanaaya he
 When the Congress managed to save its government in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, the votes of the farmers were considered important in it
 manaregaa se lekarkisaanon kii karjamaafee kaa phayda manmohan singhke netritv vaale upie ko mila tha
 Today's decision of Modi government has made it clear that bjp-led NDA is also on the same path
 gujarat main bijepi or karnataka main congress kisaanon kii naaraazgi kaa khamiyaja bhugat chuki he
 In the Gujarat elections, the BJP suffered a major loss in the rural areas
 iskaa nateeja tha ki bijepi rajya main 100 kaa kaa aankada bhi nahin chhu pai thi
 At the same time, Congress seats in rural areas have come down significantly in Karnataka assembly elections
 kairana loksabhaa upachunaav main bijepi ko ganna kisaanon kii naaraazgi kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 By increasing the MSP, the Modi government has started an exercise to break the anti-farmer image a year before the Lok Sabha elections
 piem modi 14 july ko upi ke azamgarh ja rahe he, mana ja rahaa he ki ve vahaan purvanchal ke kisaanon se mulaakaat karenge
 Before the increase in MSP, the Modi government has announced a package of Rs 8,500 crore to provide relief to sugarcane farmers
 aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav or isi saal teen rajyon main hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav ko dekhte hue ye faisla masterstroke ke taur par dekha ja rahaa he
 West Bengal is number one in paddy production
 bijepi rajya main apni jaden jamaane ke liye betaab he
 In such a situation, this decision of the government can benefit him
 chhattisgarh ko dhan kaa katoraa kaha jaataa he, jahaan isi saal vidhansabha chunaav hone hai
 In such a situation, the BJP can use it as a trump card to retain its power
 rajasthan or madhya pradesh main bhi isi saal vidhansabha chunaav hone hai
 Both of these states have BJP governments, but due to the anti-incumbency environment, the party is in danger of big loss
 aise main sarkaar ne is kadam se jariye kisaanon kii naaraazgi ko dur karne kii kuch had tak koshish kii he
 Especially in Madhya Pradesh, where farmers are being told against the government after the Mandsaur scandal
 mumbai plane krash main jaan ganvaane vaali engineyar surabhi gupta ke baad payalat maaria juberi ke parijanon ne bhi haadase par sawaal uthaae or jaanch kii maang karte hue haadase ke jimmedaar logon ko saamne laane kii guhaar lagaai
 Family of pilot Maria Zuberi said that she had assured us that she would be back home soon
 unhen ummid thi ki kharaab mausam ke kaaran chote udaan nahin bhare jaaenge or unhen jald chuttee mil jaaegi
 According to Maria's family, she was convinced that the commission would not use the aircraft for flight and would not have to fly on Thursday
 haadase se ek din pehle hemariyane apane parivaar se baat kii thi
 Her daughter had won the gold medal in the quiz competition, but now her happiness was lost
 maaria ke pati kaa kahana he ki company ne laaparvaahee dikhaai jo haadase kii vajah bani
 Family members say that we knew that the aircraft's time was over, it was a 20-year-old aircraft
 upi sarkaar ne bhi iske repering par kharch karne kii jagah bechnaa behatar samajha
 The aircraft repairing company also could not detect the flaws at the technical level due to which the accident occurred
 maaria ke parivaaravaalon kii shikaayat he ki yuai aviation ke maalik bhi haadase ke liye jimmedaar hai, kyonki unhone apni jimmedaari nahin nibhaai
 Surabhi's father raised questions
 Earlier, the family of engineer Surabhi Gupta, who was a victim of the accident, also raised questions and asked why the company allowed the chartered chartered aircraft to fly? They demand that strict action should be taken against the culprits after the investigation of the case
 surabhi ke pita ne apana dard bayaan karte hue bataaya ki haadase se pehle phone par surabhi se unki baatcheet hui thi, jisamen unhone zikr kiya tha ki unki team ek plane kii test drive par kaam kar rahi he jo kaaphi purana or khastahal he
 Surabhi's father has demanded that the entire case should be investigated and strict action should be taken against those guilty of the accident
 maaria ke gharavaalon kaa kahana he ki dijisie ke niyamon ke mutabik barish ke sijan main chote vimaanon ko test udaan kii ijaajat nahin he
 Is the agency responsible? Or the officer who allowed the flight
 ham jaananaa chaahate hai ki vimaan udaane kaa faisla kiskaa tha, or dijisie kii ore se vimaan ko udaan bharne ke liye anumati kis adhikari ke hastakshar se di gai
 Pilot Maria Zuberi and her senior Delhi pilot PS Rajput were killed on Thursday by a private company plane, but due to technical reasons, she died in Mumbai in which 5 people were killed
 12 siton vaale vimaan ke haadase kii khabar aate hi maaria kaa parivaar gam main dub gaya
 The family says that Maria was the first Muslim female pilot in the country
 jald hi sara parivaar milane vaala tha, lekin ab ye puraa milan adhuraa hi rah gaya
 Maria Zuberi was from the narrow streets of Rani Mandi area of allahabad
 bachapan se unka sapana tha ki payalat banakar hawa se baaten karnaa
 After marriage, when she reached Mumbai, the hopes got wings and there she started measuring success in the job of pilot
 pregnancy ke dauraan aapako bahut sari saavdhaaniyaan baratane kii salaah di jaati hai taaki aap or aapaki kokh main pal rahaa baccha donon surakshit rahen
 You also need to keep in mind that what you eat and what not to eat during pregnancy period, exercise, and keep taking the necessary supplements
 haalanki in sabake alaava kuch aisi bhi chijen hai jisamen laaparvaahee baratna nuksaandaayak sabit ho saktaa he

 agar ghar ke kisi hisse main putai ho rahi ho to us jagah se dur rahen
 Some substances emitted from paint are harmful for pregnant women
 unhen saans ke saath andar lene se bachein
 2- Bathing with warm water - not good for your child - If you feel relieved by taking a bath with hot water, then stop a bit
 haalanki garm pani se nahaane main koi darane kii baat nahin he lekin sambhav he ki sharir kaa taapmaana 101 degree tak pahunch jaae or aapkaa blad pressure gir saktaa he
 When this happens, your child may lack essential nutrients and oxygen
 organigeshan of terratology information sarvice (OTIS) kaa suzav he ki garbhvatee mahilaon ko apane sharir kaa taapmaana 101 degree se neeche hi rakhane kii koshish kerani chahie
 3 - Excessive intake of fruit juice - Even if you are surprised to hear this, fruit juice is not good for pregnant women because it contains a lot of sugar
 falon ke zeus se behatar he ki aap fal khaaen kyonki zeus main sugar kii maatra adhik or fibre kam hota he
 This increases the level of blood sugar
 zyada maatra main falon ke zeus ke seven se garbhaavadhi madhumeh (jestational diabetes) ho saktaa he
 4- Sleeping on the back - The most right position to sleep during pregnancy is the left side gold
 haalanki yah aapke liye thodaa mushkil bharaa ho saktaa he or aap apni pojishan badalanaa chahen to aap aisa kar sakati hai
 But keep in mind one thing to avoid sleeping on your back
 jab garbhvatee mahila peeth ke bal letati he to garbhashay kaa puraa bhaar sharir ke duusare angon par padataa he
 This can also cause blood circulation
 peeth ke bal sone se saans sambandhi samasyaayein bhi ho sakati hai
 5- Skin Care Products - Whatever you apply on your skin, it is absorbed by the body and also has an effect on your child
 pregnancy ke dauraan in chemicals se khaastaur par bachaav karnaa chahie- salicilak acid, retinoid or benzil peroxide
 Before buying your beauty product, check the ingredients once

 Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat, who arrived at an event in Mumbai on Thursday, kept silence when he was asked questions on the violence on Padmavat
 ajtak samvaadadaata ne jab is mudde sawaal poocha to jawaab dene kii bajaay mohan bhagwat ne apane munh par ungali rakhi or chuppi sadhi
 Let us tell you that Bhagwat came to the Bombay Stock Exchange in Mumbai to address nationalism and ethics in the business sector

 bijepi padmavat par doglaapan dikhaa rahi he
 He surrounded Smriti Irani that the Censor Board comes under the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting
 jo ki centre main bijepi sarkaar ke adheen he

 mohan bhagwat ne yahaan kaha ki ham pichley kai saalon se dushmano se ladate hue aa rahe hai, jiske chakkar main jan-dhan kii haani hoti he
 Mohan Bhagwat said that even today we read foreign texts to understand ourselves, we do not read our own texts
 bhagwat ne kaha ki pratispardhaa sahi he, lekin gusse main galat faisle uthaakar bharat ko mahashakti nahin bana sakate
 He said that in the last 500-700 years, the glory of our country has not decreased even while fighting aggressive Islam

 What is our right direction? ham videshiyon kii aakhon se duniya ko dekhne lage hai
 He said that it has not been so far that what has gone on will move in the same direction
 bhagwat bole ki jo vyapaar chal rahaa he usase videshiyon ke sanskaar aaenge
 And wrong disease will come
 isse hamen darana nahin chahie, videshon ke kaarobaari lihaaj se aadan-pradaan karnaa hoga
 We have to adopt everyone without fear, we must go fearless
 guwahati main bhi kiya tha sambodhitapako bataa den ki isse pehle bhi beete saptaah guwahati main mohan bhagwat ne pakistan par nishaanaa saadhaa tha
 In this meeting, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat had targeted the neighboring country, saying that India had forgotten all its enmity with Pakistan, but Pakistan did not do so
 unhone kaha ki jab tak hindutv fale-phoolegaa, tab tak hi bharat kaa astitv bana rahegaa
 The union chief addressed the meeting in Guwahati just days before the elections in the three northeastern states of Tripura, Meghalaya and Nagaland
 unhone kaha ki sangharsh hua, pakistan kaa janm hua
 India forgot enmity with Pakistan since August 15, 1947, but Pakistan has not forgotten it yet
 hindu swabhaav or duusare ke swabhaav main yahi antar he

 612:05 AM modi shandaar shaks hai: shatrughna sinha12:01 AM ham rail bajet main nai trainon kii ghoshnaa kii parampara band kar rahe hai: manoj sinha The second part of the autobiography of the famous crime fiction writer Surendra Mohan Pathak of our era, 'hum Nahi Change, Bura Na Koy' has just been published from Rajkamal Publications
 sahitya ajtak par padhie uskaa ek rochak ansh, aakhir maut se itnaa kyon darate hai surendra mohan pathak***sitambar 1970 ke 'lokapriy lekhak’ main meraa sunil siries kaa upanyaas 'pakistan kii hasina’ chapa tha, jiskaa maine naam 'aaparishan pakistan’ rakhaa tha
 But publisher Mahendra Sharma had a craze that he changed the name of the novel to 'pakistan Ki Hasina' without telling me, while there was no Hasina in the novel to make the name meaningful
 san 1970 main james band kaa nayaa- paanchavaan-upanyaas 'aaparishan bainkak’ bhi chapa tha, jo maine meerut ke ek prakaashak kalpana pocket books ke liye likhaa tha or ek tarah se ek script hi kharaab kii thi
 After that, i never had any connection with that publisher
 aaj mujhe ye tak yaad nahin wo koun tha, uskaa naam kya tha yaa uskaa meerut main aphis kahan tha
 As i returned, in 1970, in the month of October, my father suffered a heart attack for the third time
 tatkaal unhen itio par sthit doctor sen ke nursing home main pahunchaaya gaya
 In those days of such woes, there were no fancy treatments like angioplasty, bypass surgery, open heart surgery today
 angeography kaa bhi chalan abhi nahin hua tha
 The empty ECG was then a test, which the heart specialist says today does not reveal anything special, and the cure was to eat a blood thinner pill, avoid food and drink, take an injection of pathadin and rest
 yani tab kisi ko heart atake hota tha to uskaa ainda anjaam uski takadir ke hi hawaale hota tha jo ki acha-bura kaisaa bhi nateeja nikaal sakati thi
 On the evening of 23 October, my father was talking to my mother in her room at the nursing home that fused like a bulb
 baat kaa aadha fikaraa ucharaa tha or aadha abhi munh main hi tha ki paralok sidhaar gaye the
 Later it was found that what was spent on them was not called a heart attack, it was called heart failure, in the language of medical science, it was called myocardial infarction
 ghar kaa maalik chalaa gaya, kuch poshaaken or do jodi juute peeche chhodkar
 He did not have the mood of 'four loaves one longi', then there was not even so much material that there would be a bed in the house, where he would see his eyes
 unki poshaakon, juuton kaa darja to bakaul gaalib jaise 'chand tasaveerebutaan chand haseenon ke khatut’ jaisaa tha
 Contrary to the above, when farajand-e-pannalal will reach that end, it will become difficult to maintain the frills left behind by the family
 baharhaal maut se wo meri pehali rubaru mulaakaat thi
 i spent a whole year in madness
 har ghadi mere ko lagata tha ki main abhi mara, abhi meraa pita sareekha anjaam hua
 Hunger and thirst flew away, sleep stopped at night
 tab tak ghunt kaa main baqayada rasiyaa ban gaya tha phir bhi hviski ke kareeb fatakane kii himmat nahin hoti thi
 As soon as i used to go to the office, it seemed that i would die in the bus
 kai baar aisi bad haalat hui ki bich raste utar gaya, footpath par hi baith gaya, kisi kaabil khud ko mahasoos kiya to ghar vaapis lautakar doctor ke paas gaya, jo meri alamat se waakif tha, kyonki pehle bhi main uske paas jaataa tha
 He would give me a bullet and explain that everything was psychological, nothing had happened to me
 main samajhataa tha, aphis jaataa tha, jaise-taise kaam karata tha lekin shaam ko ghar lautataa tha to phir dehshat sataane lagati thi, doctor kaa samajhaayaa sab mithyaa lagane lagata tha
 The family members, especially my mother, were very concerned about me
 doctor pita kaa waakif tha, wo meri babat usase daryaft karne jaati thi to wo use bhi vahi jawaab detaa tha ki sab cycolagical tha, apane aap thik ho jayega
 But it was not right
 kai baar raat ko do baje maine aisi ghabrahat or tadpan mahasoos kii jaise ki agali saans nahin aane vaali thi
 The doctor used to stay close, two blocks away
 badi mushkil se wo sote se uthta tha or bhunbhunaata hua, pita kii dosti ke mulahje main, ghar aata tha or morphine kaa injection de ke chalaa jaataa tha
 At the same time, i used to go with strict instructions that i was just a victim of illusion, Ainda should never be called at night
 us doctor ke us mizaaj kaa ek tajurba mujhe pehle bhi ho chukaa tha
 The wife of our tenant's mother, four children, had a migraine-like headache, due to which she would always feel a sudden pain
 wo doctor kirayedar kaa waakif tha kyonki uske liye accounts likhata tha or uski inakam tex ritern bharta tha
 In this visit, he used to come to see his wife and some emergency treatment
 aisa daura ek baar bivi ko shaam aath baje ke kareeb padaa
 The tenant ran his elder boy to the doctor, who returned him with the assurance that i will come in a while
 lekin na aayaa
 Then the tenant himself ran
 usne usko bhi vahi jawaab dekar lautaaya ki thodi der main aata hoon
 The entire area was the only MBBS doctor, so the tenant did not want to go to another doctor
 aakhir jab doctor aayaa, bivi brain hemarej se mar chuki thi
 Except five-month-old Dudhumahi-fourth child
 kirayedar kaa maine ye haal dekha ki lagata tha ki bivi ke saath hi mar jayega
 Wept in roaring, hitting the wall and mourning - "hi, i was robbed, loco!" "darun was the scene, the heart was shaken seeing
 patni kii chita kii raakh thandi nahin hui thi ki saali byaah laayaa tha- wo bhi chupchaap nahin, baqayada sehre baandhakar, qamar main talwaar baandhakar gaya tha!kitna kshanbhangur tha chaar bacchon kii maan patni se bichhudane kaa dukh, avsaad, matam, gam!aaj kii tarah un dinon privet nursing homes kii bharmaar nahin hoti thi isliye raat ko koi madical immergency aan khadi ho to use atend karne ke liye doctor talash karnaa nihaayat mushkil hota tha
 The nearest government hospital was Irvine which was at Delhi Gate but there was no way to get the patient there at midnight
 lihaaja subah hone kaa intjaar karne ke alaava koi chaara nahin hota tha
 i stayed up all night and woke up all the members of the house
 din main maan waakif doctor ke paas jaati thi to doctor use samajhaata tha ki wo raat ke do baje sote se uthakar home visit ke liye baar-baar nahin aa saktaa tha
 Then what did he have to do? Only one injection had to be given! Someone at home learns to inject, there will be no need to call it
 unheen dinon ek baar shaam ko chaar baje, chuttee hone se ek ghanta pehle mujhe aphis main hi aisa mahasoos hone laga ki mujhe dil kaa daura padane laga tha
 Seeing my senses flew, one of my mechanic got me on his scooter and took me to Irwin Hospital
 vahaan meraa wo haal dekha gaya to mujhe abjarveshan ke liye bhartee kar liya gaya
 i told the mechanic to inform my house that i will not come home at night, but do not tell me that i was admitted in the hospital
 ''pathak sahab," mechanic ne josh se mujhe aashwaasan diya- ''aap ghabraana nahin
 You will give as much blood as you need here
 "''thankyuu
 Go now, call
 ''wo nigahon se abhi bhi mujhe aashwaasan detaa chalaa gaya
 He was illiterate, even if i could explain it to him, he was not going to understand that my case - if that case turns out to be - was not going to require blood
 usne pataa nahin kaise wo khabar phone par doharaai ki ghar main kisi ko uski baat kaa yakeen na aayaa
 When he was asked stubbornly, he said that i was admitted in Irvine Hospital
 raat ko meraa ek saalaa hospital pahunch gaya
 When he met the doctor, it was found that the ECG was done which was found to be quite right, it did not appear that i had any problem
 raat main hospital ke ward main soya or sabere chuttee paakar ghar lautaa
 My mother and sisters met me as if i had returned to life from a war cry
 maan roti thi
 The grief of my husband's death had not subsided yet, i had created a new misfortune
 bivi garbhvatee thi, abhi do bahanen gaiyr-shaadishuda thim, aise main mujhe kuch ho jaataa to peeche kya bitati!baharhaal sadame se main to sata hua tha hi, gharavaale bhi khub sataae gaye
 Then as soon as that calamity was broken on me, so suddenly left the chase
 kya hua, kaise hua, chamatkaar se kam nahin tha
 Just then, the doer did, 'mitty Dhund Jag Chanan Hoya', i was about to die as suddenly as i had felt, so suddenly i felt that nothing had happened, i was completely healthy
 us daur kii ek baat mujhe bada hairaan karti he
 How could i keep writing Navel in that bad situation? My one-year mindset must have hindered my novel writing, but my record suggests that i wrote Badastur even during that time, between October 1970 to October 1971
 i had eight new novels printed in a year's time! i was always a victim of health - i still am - it is my habit to look at the small things related to health
 Had went
 pet main jaraa kharabi ho, wo jaraa dard kare, mujhe lagata tha ulcer tha, jaraa khaansi thik na ho, mujhe lagata tha tapedic thi, jaraa saans ukhde, mujhe lagata tha dama tha, jaraa vajan ghate, main soch letaa tha cancer sir uthaa rahaa tha
 i was wandering from doctor to doctor, i did not knowingly go to the doctor knowing that the news would reach home
 kai nawakif doctoron ne mere bebuniyaad khauf ko apane haq main cash kiya, gairajaruri test karaae, gairajaruri davaaiyaan khilaayin
 a doctor was a bit psyched, he said bluntly- “pathak sir, if you think of yourself as a victim of diseases, one of them was really you, then when you would have been walking
 aap salaamat ho, chaukas mere saamne baithe ho, yahi safeeshent saboot he ki aapako koi beemaari nahin
 "in AIIMS, there was an internal exchange of thousands of lines of ITI, which i used to visit there frequently
 ek baar main vahaan us section main gaya jahaan isiji hota tha
 The operator knew me as a technician of ITI so when i asked him to do his ECG, he gave it to ECG without any permission
 maine nattejey ke bare main poocha to wo bolaa ki thodaa nuks tha
 If i had worked wisely, i would have requested a consultation with the doctor, who would tell me in detail what was wrong and whether he could harm me
 aisa karne kii jagah, itiai vaapis lautne kii jagah, main baaraa tuuti chalaa gaya jahaan ki tab meri bivi gai hui thi
 i told the wife about the ECG and Nidhal fell on Dewan
 bivi ne maan se baat kii to maan ne fouran ek waakif doctor ko-jiskaa naam pannalaal tha-ghar bula liya
 He was a famous doctor of the area, aged, himself, Omprakash Sharma used to say that if half of his children were alive today, it was because of Dr
 Pannalal - he saw the ECG, inspected me and said shrieking - "get up and sit
" tuje kuch nahin hua
 "I got up in a hurry
 ''are, padhaa-likhaa ladkaa he, itnaa bhi nahin samajhataa ki agar tere isiji main koi gambheer nuks hota to itnaa bada hospital kya tuje ghar chalaa jane detaa? xxrep 4 ' lekin,''’ main dabe swar main bolaa, ''isiji oparator kahata tha
 
 
 '' '' Who used to say? '' '' ECG operator
 xxrep 4 ' jo doctor se upar hota he, thik? heart kii babat jisko doctor se zyada gyaan hota he, thik?''mere munh se bol na phuta
 He was an Idiot operator
 uskaa kaam mashin oparate karnaa tha, isiji ke rigelt kii babat apni raay dena nahin tha
 It was the doctor's job to study the ECG and also to give his qualified opinion
 xxrep 4 ' isiji main koi kharabi nahin?'' main budbudaya
 '' There is a minor fault, but it is within asymptomatic parameters that can be seen in someone's ECG if the ECG is not done in ideal conditions
 teri saas ke bulaave par main dauda-dauda yahan aayaa hoon, abhi meraa isiji kiya jaae to tere vaale se zyada kharabi dikhayega jabaki mujhe dil kii koi alamat nahin, ghode kii tarah majboot he meraa dil
 Got something? ”I nodded in agreement
 ''naahak sabakaa dam nikaal diya
 Now get up and run again
 ''tab jaakar meri jaan main jaan ai

 adhikari ne kaha ki pehle kaa niyam tarksangat tha, kyonki kai sansthaanon main sevanivritti kii aayu 55 yaa 56 saal hoti thi
 In today's scenario, the retirement age is 58 years and now this provision of this scheme is no longer logical

 Some of such people include Pandit Badri Narayan Pandey, a 78-year-old teacher living in Chhapra, Bihar

 The funny thing is that these five languages have been provided to you in a single book

 badri narayan ne bataaya ki bhashaa kii samaj or jaankaree ke liye behatar shabdaawalee kaa hona behad jaruri he
 a comparative study of the language should be done to know the diversity of the language
 pandey ne bataaya ki shikshan kaary ke dauraan hi unhen ye baat pataa chali ki duniya kii kai bhashaaen ek duusare se milti hai or tab se hi wo is dictionari par kaam kar rahe the
 Pandey said that during his MA studies, he had read a book of 'bloomfield' in which he saw that Arabic, Persian, German and French, all languages are meeting each other
 pandey ne bataaya ki percian or sanskrit bhashaa ek duusare se bahut milte hai isliye unhen isaki vividhta ko samajhane main zyada pareshaani nahin hui
 He also read many books for knowledge of German language
 badri narayan ne bataaya ki is dictionari kii pariklpana to unhone bahut pehle kar lee thi lekin isko mul rup main laane kaa kaam sevanivritti ke baad hi de paae
 Pandey was born in a very simple family in the village of Hulesra in Siwan district, Bihar
 badri narayan ke pita kaa naam pandit raas bihari pandey tha jo peshey se chhapra court main mukhtaar the
 Pandey topped the studies since childhood
 saal 1955 main metric, saal 1957 main chhapra ke rajendra college se intermediat, or saal 1959 main isi college se snaatak kii degree lee thi
 After taking education, the work of teaching started from the year 1960, which is still going on

 This effort by Badri Narayan Pandey is truly praise-worthy and it is hoped that this dictionary created by him will help the students a lot

 The minimum qualification for the illegal occupation of land and houses of Jharkhand public enterprises is that you should be an influential leader, official or something like that

 Not only this, if we go a little further, it will be seen that his own cabinet colleague and AJSU leader Chandraprakash Chaudhary has been occupying the quarters of the Central Coal Limited (CCL), a public undertaking of the Government of India for the last several years

 When the advocate of the Ministry of Heavy Industries informed the court that the State Government of Jharkhand had been written to provide suitable force to remove these encroachments, the court gently shouted, "empty correspondence does nothing is

 a member of the family stands near the stairs outside the temple and the female bear enters the temple with her two children

 This phase of devotion of bears has been going on since last year
 mandir ke pujari bataate hai ki is dauraan na to ye bhaaluu kabhi hinsak hue hai or na hi kisi duusare bhakt ko aaj tak koi nuksaan pahunchaaya he
 However, if someone bothers them in the midst of their devotion, tries to drive them away or stops eating prasad, then they are definitely expressing their anger
 gramin jahaan bhaaluon kii is bhakthi ko maa kii krupa maan rahe hai, vahiin vanyajeev visheshgy iske peeche jangalon main bhaaluon ke liye khaane kii kami ko mukhya vajah maanate hai
 Whatever be the reason, this Devi temple of Bagbahara is becoming famous due to these bears

 unhone kaha ki ‘mujhe congress ke vichaarrahit abhiyaan kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Amarinder Singh adopted the same method of dealing with me which he has been adopting in his career in dealing with the Akali Dal
 akkhad, abhadra or managasaint aarope
 Either of them will work
 jetali ne apane blog par likhaa ki durbhaagya se unke liye unhen ek alag tarah ke abhiyaan se nipatna padaa
 My campaign focused on both national and Amritsar region levels
 main unhen vinamrata se, lekin kadai se jawaab dene main sakasham tha
 Along with Amarinder, Jaitley also accused Congress leaders like p Chidambaram, Kapil Sibal, Manish Tiwari, Jairam Ramesh, Anand Sharma and Beni Prasad Verma of arrogance and indecency in their efforts to end Modi's popularity among the people of the country

 shailendra pandeya - jyotishi Where is our society going, where a father is raping a daughter and a son is a mother? Women are shown as an object in society, why all the questions to women? Remembering Nirbhaya, Minister of State in Modi government Anupriya Patel said that in any kind of rape case, there is no time-bound investigation and they are not able to get justice within the time period
 nirbhaya ke mata-pita kii jo bhi shikaayatein hai wo inhen vajahon se hai
 They have been wandering for justice for seven years
 ham sansad ke andar bhi mahilaon ke muddon ko lekar aawaaj uthaate hai
 Women are from any political party, they always exaggerate on these issues
 ham sab ne charchaa kii hai tabhi desh main kade kanoon bane hai
 Made in 2014, made after 2012 and also made in 2019
 ye samaaj, jab koi mudda uthaata he to usapar vimarsh hota he or phir agar isamen koi kami rah jaati he to ham usapar kaam bhi karte hai
 The result of today's discourse is that the judicial process should be completed within the scope of the time period
 desh ke sabhi rajyon main rape jaise jaghanya aparaadh ho rahe hai lekin sabhi maamalon main doshi qaraar die jane kii prakriya main lanbaa samay lag jaataa he
 There is a shortage of judges in courts, so it takes time to settle cases
 sabase pehle hamen is system kii kamiyon par kaam karnaa hoga
 Police will have to take their responsibility
 system ko majboot bananaa lagaataar chalane vaali prakriya he
 We have not been able to do it all at once
 sabhi sarkarein thodaa-thodaa koshish karti hai
 But my own opinion is that we are missing the priority with which women issues need attention
 sadan ke andar humlog is disha main kaaphi prayaas kar rahe hai jisase peediton ko jald insaaf mili
 There is also a social aspect to this problem
 saamaajik mulyon main giravat bhi is tarah ke maamalon main badhotaree ke liye jimmedaar he
 i come across Sharma saying that a son is raping his mother
 pita betiyon ko chen main baandhakar unka rape kar rahaa he
 How are we moving towards society? Where have our family values gone? These are India where women are worshiped but one son, mother and father is raping daughter
 kis tarah ke samaaj kii ore bad rahe hai?in sabaki shuruyaat ghar se kerani hogi
 Why all the restrictions are from women? In society, women are shown as an object
 ye puraa vishay kisi rajya yaa desh kaa nahin he balki antarrashtriya mudda he
 Equality of women is being talked about everywhere but it will be possible only when the issue of their safety is in priority

 nayaa janata parivaar bana he bijepi ko takkar dene ke liye
 Mulayam, Lalu, Nitish, Chautala, Deve Gowda are all united and will be led by Mulayam Singh Yadav
 dekha jaay to yah pichhadon kii numaaindgi karne waalon kii party he magar is parivaar kaa ek saath rahanaa hi inaki chunauti he
 These gather only to disintegrate
 ab dekhte hai iskaa asar bihar main kya hoga
 Lalu and Nitish's meeting looks strong on paper, but if you look at it in terms of votes, it is not a reality
 lalu kaa pichley dinon jithan ram maanjhi ko lagaataar shah dete rahanaa kisi se chupa nahin he
 Manjhi is also accompanied by RJD MP Pappu Yadav
 maanjhi bijepi ke netaaon se mil rahe hai magar baat nahin ban rahi he
 Because of Manjhi's controversial statements, BJP does not want to touch them, instead BJP wants Manjhi to form a new party which includes Pappu Yadav and help his party from behind the BJP so that Manjhi can campaign all over Bihar and make a dent in Mahadalit vote bank Began udhar lalu yadav kii chintaa he ki is nae janata parivaar main unke parivaar ke liye kya he
 Cannot contest elections on his own, but the future of Rabri, Misa and both sons is a question
 siton kaa gathbandhan kaise hoga
 Currently JDU has 115 seats and RJD has only 22 seats
 aise main siton ke bantwaare main matbhed hona laazmi he
 Till now JDU used to contest 141 and BJP 102 seats
 congress bhi isamen apana hissaa maangegi
 JDU also has a group of disgruntled leaders who are looking to join the BJP at the time of elections
 bijepi ke paas bhi 141 siton par utane majboot ummidavaar nahin hai kyonki unhone in siton par kabhi chunaav nahin ladaa
 JDU used to fight these seats
 nitish kii majaburi he ki maanjhi ko mukhyamantri bana kar unhone jo raajnneetik daanv khelaa wo ulta pad gaya
 The damage that Manjhi has done to Nitish's image is taking time to compensate and it may have affected Nitish Kumar's confidence as well
 saath hi loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi kaa 22 siten jeet le janaa bhi unki majaburi he
 This is the reason why Nitish Kumar wants to strengthen his fort by joining hands with Lalu
 bihar main 15 fisadi yadav, 17 fisadi muslim or 7 fisadi kurmi ek majboot vot bank hai
 23 per cent of it may be an extremely backward alliance in which it will be difficult to make a dent
 yahi vajah he ki bijepi 16 fisadi dalit voton par najar garaae hue he
 Overall, everyone has their own helplessness in Bihar, due to which they have come together
 raajnneeti main koi kisi kaa sthai dost yaa dushman nahin hota
 However, once Nitish Kumar had said that people of Lalu ji and our party go to each other party, then they are immediately set up because till now we all have worked together at some time from the JP movement
 ummid rahegi ki ye formula is baar kaam kar jaae or yah nayaa janata parivaar thode dinon tak tik jaae kam se kam bihar chunaav tak

 Although the state leadership of Congress in Rajasthan is not in favor of alliance with BSP, but Rahul is willing to give up some seats in the state for BSP
 madhya pradesh main basapa 2013ke vidhansabha chunaav main 4 siten jiti thi or kareeb ek darjan siton par duusare sthaan par thi

 das saal ke bheetar karodon haathon main mobile dene vaale telecom udyog kii pratispardhaa (do companiyaan bachiin) mrityu shaiya par he
 Ganga water is being pumped into the mouths of the remaining government companies, networks are incurable and mobile services are becoming expensive
 desh kii sabase chamakdaar kranti ediyaan ragad rahi he
 This may have happened less in a country like India when within a decade the policy blindness of the governments has decimated the country's biggest success
 sabase pehle sabase taaja udhaaharan
 
 
 If the telecom companies were to be given relief, then why was the Department of Telecom fighting since 2005 to implement a new definition of new license fees under which the country's major private telecom (especially Air Tail and vodafone-idea) companies have a close Lakh Crore Rs
 kii dendaree nikali he
 Now a committee of top officers has been set up to save the companies drowning from this burden, which will bring a new relief package
 march, 2015 main modi sarkaar ne bharat ke itihaas kii tathakthith sabase safal spectrum nilaamee kii thi
 In front of the cameras, the minister was claiming that 1 from this auction
 10 lakh karod ru
 Will meet; And the government has made up for the alleged loss of the 2G scam
 lekin march 2018 aate-aate, oonchi keemat par spectrum kharidne vaali telecom companiyaan 7
 7 lakh crore Rs
 ke karj main dab gayi
 Melted by the companies' cheering (mobilization), the government decided that now they will pay spectrum fees in 16 years instead of ten years
 yani march 2015 kii mahaan ‘uplabdhi’ teen saal ke bheetar companiyon par 550 arab ru
 Changed to kindness aap phir puch sakate hai ki agar maafee hi deni thi to itnaa mahangaa spectrum bechney kii jarurat kya thi
 The government did not get anything, nothing of the companies was lost, just the banks (savings of common people) were cut, which were giving loans to companies in exchange for spectrum
 galatiyon se na seekhney kii jid is udyog se judi sarkari nitiyon kaa sthaayee bhav ban chuki he
 Since the release of telecom companies from the clutches of huge license fees in 1999, till date the government has not been able to decide whether it wants to let the companies thrive or squeeze them
 supreme court ke faisle ke baad ek baar phir sarkaar kaa ek haath companiyon ko nichod lenaa chahta he jabaki doosraa uske liye uddhaar package gadhane main laga he
 The policy haze that strangled the telecom sector started with a 2G scam that was never proved in court
 sabhi aaropee bari ho gaye
 Investigative agencies did not bother to go to a higher court against the High Court's decision, but the decision of the accused resulted in the cancellation of licenses of 122 companies in five years
 arabon kaa nivesh duba, hajaaron kii naukariyaan gayi or doorsanchaar bazaar kaa cheharaa badal gaya
 Competition in the industry was over
 cartil or ekadhikaar ubharne lage
 Engaged in the mobilization of private companies, the government forgot to make their enterprises (BSNL-MTNL) competitive
 aaj donon sarkari companiyaan itihaas banane kii taraf agrasar hai
 First hefty license fees or expensive spectrum and then bail out
 
 
 bharat ke telecom sector main yah itani baar hua he ki bhavar main funs kar puraa kaa puraa udyog tabah ho gaya
 It is difficult to say whether the scam happened in or after 2G allocation, but today we are standing here: • The entire market is confined in the hands of two companies
 usamen bhi ek (airtel) buree haalat main he or duusari (vodaphone-idia) ab gai ki tab
 • New npas of banks are rising in the telecom sector • Mobile networks have gone from bad to worse • Implementation of 5G is difficult
 isamen ab ekadhikaar kaa khatra he
 Because spectrum rentals are only in Reliance Jio • Now the plight of expensive telecom service Hatelicom revolution has been due to confusion in the policy of sharing natural resources in the market
 rajasav ko badhata hua dikhaane ke liye sarkaar ne oonchi keemat par spectrum kii nilaamee (yaa fees) kii or karodon upabhoktaaon ke bazaar ko rajnatik rasookh vaali do-teen companiyon ko saunp diya
 These companies took loans (depositors' money) from banks and kept them in the government's account and then later took the payment of fees
 yahi supreme court ke taaja nirnay ke baad hone vaala he
 The need was that the resources be properly evaluated
 unhen sasta rakhaa jaae taaki unke istemaal se nivesh, maang, naukariyaan or pratispardhaa bade or upabhokta ke liye daren kam rahen
 We are now close to the mourning of the telecom revolution, where more than one lakh jobs have been lost since 2015
