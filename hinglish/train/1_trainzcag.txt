 fasebuk ke siio mark jakarberg ne america congress ke saamne cambridge analitica data li ko lekar tikhe sawaalon ke jawaab die
 During this time, 44 senators asked him alternately questions
 sabhi ko 5 minute die gaye
 While answering these questions, at times Zuckerberg was also very nervous
 padhein, 5 ghante lambii is sunwaayee main kaise sawaal puche gaye or jakarberg ne kya die jawaab
 UPDATE: Senator - Do you know how many Facebook users read the privacy policy completely? Zuckerberg - No, i do not know
 zyaadaatar log privesi policy ko puraa nahin padhate
 UPDATE: Senator - Facebook has changed a lot from the dorm room
 fasebuk ne timeline feechar launch kiya or tab se elgoridm bhi badla he
 New questions have arisen since Cambridge Analytica
 kya yugers un chizon par bharosa kar sakate hai jo news feed par dekhte hai, kyonki fasebuk se trust kam ho rahaa he logon kaa
 Does Facebook use mobile device audio? How do you look at artificial intelligence when it comes to consumer security
 
 Zuckerberg - You are talking about the Conspiracy Theory, we do not take or record audio from mobile
 AI system faisla lete hai jo kai baar yugers ko samaj nahin aata ki wo faisla kis aadhaar par lete hai
 In the coming time it will be decided what is their decision making principle
 UPDATE: senetter - kal fasebuk ne 87 million yugers ko notification bhejnaa shuru kiya jisamen se meri beti bhi he jise ye notification mila he
 How many state users are there? How long does it take for data to be deleted
 kya kol or massej record kiye hai?jakarberg - is bare main jaankaree nahin he
 Yes, data is deleted after deleting the account
 iske bare main mere paas abhi jawaab nahin he ki data delit hone main kitna vakt lagata he
 (in response to this question, Zuckerberg stuttered and said that i can't say how long it takes) Not calling and not recording text, but there is a feature in Messenger that imports messages into text Can go and there are similar text stores, this feature is in Android smartphones
 UPDATE: senetter - discrimination ko lekar is desh kaa itihaas kharaab rahaa he
 Platforms like Facebook are being used to promote decriminalization
 vigyaapan dene vaale bhi fasebuk yugers main discriminete kar rahe hai jo fedral kanoon kaa ulanghan bhi he
 Investigation revealed that Facebook is still not able to control ads that contain advertisements with disclaimers
 haal hi main ek mukadmaa daayar kiya gaya tha jisame aise vigyaapan ke bare main kaha gaya jo discrimination vaala tha
 Zuckerberg - This is the important question
 AI tul se aise contant par kaabo paaya jaataa he
 It is difficult to review all kinds of things one by one
 is tarah ke kshetra main hamen zyada rivyuu karne kii jarurat he
 (mark Zuckerberg seems to be answering round about this question too) UPDATE: Senator - about the bug bounty program - you have promoted bug bounty on Facebook
 aap bag bounty program ko is tarah kii samasyaon kaa samdhaan karne ko lekar kaise dekhte hai
 Zuckerberg - i do not understand your question
 iskaa jawaab meri team aapako de sakati he baad main
 UPDATE: Senator - Amazing story even from the dorm room
 kya aapako lagata he aap zyada powerful hai? jab companiyaan badi ho jaati hai to yaa to wo regaullett karti hai yaa brake kar jaati hai, aisa itihaas rahaa he, aap ise kaise dekhte hai
 What is Facebook actually? People think that you are the largest publisher in the world, because the content is read only on Facebook
 aap tech company hai duniya ke sabase bade publisher hanjacrbarg: 2 billian yugers hai hamaare paas jo duniya bhar main faile hai or iske liye america ko garv hona chahie
 i am not this kind of person, i cannot regulate
 mujhe lagata he ham tech company he
 We are responsible for the content, but we do not make content, so we are not a content company and we should be called a tech company and we make products
 UPDATE: senetter - kya rus or china kii sarkaar ke paas fasebuk kaa data he? jaise cambridge analitica ke cese main dekhne ko mila he?jakarberg - eps ke paas kis tarah kaa data he isaki jaanch kar rahe hai
 We cannot say how much data someone has
 UPDATE : senetter: kya fasebuk ko yujar kii parmishan kii jarurat nahin he jab wo unka data bech rahaa he? kya aap opt injakarbarg- hamen parmishan kii jarurat hoti he
 But we do not sell information at all
 UPDATE: senetter - kya aap het spich ko diphine kar sakate hai? aap ek pita ke taur par kya aap soshal media se pareshaan hai ?jakarberg - yah kaaphi mushkil sawaal he
 But any kind of violence should not be done on Facebook and we are constantly trying to stop it
 kisi bhi tul kaa acha or bura istemaal kiya jaataa he vaise hi fasebuk bhi he
 UPDATE: Senator - How much data does Facebook store? Facebook stores data of 96 categories of 2 billion users? what is this ? What kind of data are you storing on your server? Do you also store text history, activity and device location? Zuckerberg - We don't know what you're talking about
 do katigari hai jo mujhe lagata he- contant jo yujar khud detaa he or doosraa wo he jo vigyaapan ke liye ham lete hai
 You have control over both these types of data
 fasebuk in donon tarah ke data ko store karata he
 We store people's data
 text history, activity or divaais lokation yugers kii marji se store karte hai
 UPDATE: Senator - You make money from users' data and say that you own the user data? How is this possible? Zuckerberg - Your data is yours
 This means that you want to share the data with yourself on Facebook
 UPDATE: senetter -yugers ko chintaa hoti he ki aap uski browjing history trek karte hai, yujar ke us tarah ke data kaa aap kya karte hai? udhaaharan ke taur par main whatsap ke jariye kisi se baat kar rahaa hum kya wo kisi vigyapandaata ko pataa chalegaa?jakarberg - main ise thik se nahin samaj paa rahaa hum aap kya kahana chaahate hai
 The advertiser does not know about the message of whatsapp
 
 UPDATE: Senator - Data is the center point of your business model and earn money from data itself
 aap kyon nahin yugers ko bataate hai ki unka data aap kaise yuj karenge or kis tarah kaa data colect karte hai jinke bare main unhen nahin pataa hejakerbarg - aam taur par do tarah ke data fasebuk ke paas hote hai
 The first is that users give themselves to Facebook and share it on Facebook
 doosraa data wo he jo ham vigyaapan ke liye colect karte hai or wo yujar ke bihaviour ko lekar he taaki unhen sahi vigyaapan die ja saken
 If you want, you can turn it off so that Facebook does not take your data
 jakarberg - log khud chunate hai ki koun si jaankaree ap develpar ke saath share karenge
 UPDATE: Senator - Facebook manipulates trending news and deliberately deletes many pages for its own benefit? Why is this so? Does Facebook support anyone? Do you know the political leanings of 15 thousand people? Zuckerberg - We do not ask about the political view of anyone nor does it set jobs in Facebook
 UPDATE: senetter - kya aapako nahin lagata ki yugers ko safataur par jaankaree milani chahie ki unka data kahaan bechaa ja rahaa he or kaise yuj kiya ja rahaa he?jakarberg : aapaki baat sahi he or main isse sahamat hum
 We have a download your data tool from which users can download their data
 UPDATE: Senator - Alexander Kogan's Terms of Service wrote that he could sell data? Who is responsible for this? Were you aware of this? Has anyone been fired from the company for this? Zuckerberg - The App Review Team is responsible for this, but no one has been fired yet
 mujhe is bare main zyada jaankaree nahin he
 i do not know about the terms of the app
 UPDATE: Senator - If we want to delete Facebook account, can we delete the shared data first? What about the data that you have already sold for advertising
 jakarberg - haa aap aisa kar sakate hai
 We do not sell data for advertising
 This is a misconception
 UPDATE : senetter - kis tarah kii jaankariyaan fasebuk colect kar rahaa he or kise bhej rahaa he? haal hi main massenger kids aayaa he jo 6-12 saal ke bacchon ke liye he
 What is the guarantee that you are not sharing children's data? Zuckerberg - Users have control over what they want to share with whom
 bacchon kaa massenger kam se kam data yuj kiya jaataa he or ise kisi bhi third party ap ke saath share nahin kiya jayega
 UPDATE -senator - Do you track a device connected to Facebook
 kya fasebuk divaais ko bhi trek karata he? cross divaais trekking
 Zuckerberg - i do not have an answer to this question yet
 baad main iskaa jawaab diya ja saktaa he
 i do not have information about this
 fasebuk duusare ap kaa data colect nahin karata he
 If you are using Google or text app then Facebook does not see these data
 UPDATE -senetter - kya soshal media par fasebuk kaa ekadhikaarwaad hejakerbarg - mujhe aisa nahin lagata he
 UDPATE - Senator - Due to Facebook, anyone can even die, has this been said by a Facebook official? What do you have to say on this? Who are your competitors Do you have monopolyism on social media? Zuckerberg - i do not agree with this, he wrote in an internal note
 google, aipal or amejon hamaare pratidwandi hai
 We do not have monopolyism on social media
 
 UPDATE - SENATOR - Hundred speeches have been killed in Myanmar, including Facebook's role in Hackerberg - we are working for it and hiring people who know the language there to stop it
 UPDATE- kya log of hone ke baad bhi fasebuk browjing history trek karata he?mark jakarberg - iskaa jawaab detel or sateek dene ko kah kar taal diya he
 That is, they did not answer
 UPDATE - mark jakarberg - main 2015 main cambridge analitica ke saath kaam nahin kar rahaa tha isliye tab ise bain karne kaa koi sawaal hi nahin tha
 UPDATE - Mark Zuckerberg - i was not aware that Cambridge is campaigning for the Analytica Trump
 UPDATE - How will Facebook overcome other countries' influence and propaganda in elections? We have done well in the French election, the German election
 hamane nayaa AI tul shuru kiya he jo galat jaankariyon ko hataata he or farji akanunt ko bhi delit karata he
 UPDATE: Mark Zuckerberg - AI will be fully developed in 5 to 10 years and this will control fake news
 UPDATE: seenetter : fasebuk kaa itihaas rahaa he data li kaa or 14 saal se aap lagaataar maafee bhi maang rahe hai
 Mark Zuckerberg: We made a lot of mistakes
 isamen kai galtiyaan logon ko conect karne ko lekar kii gai hanyamufdhaathai: mark jakarberg: fasebuk kaa data aap control kar sakate handufdhaathai: cambridge analitica ke mutabik unhone fasebuk hack nahin kiya he na hi koi kanoon todaa he
 
 We did not hack Facebook or break any laws – SCL Elections licensed data from a research company called GSR which obtained the data via a tool provided by Facebook, a common practice at the time
 - Cambridge Analytica (@camanalytica) April 10, 2018UPDATE: Cambridge Analytica has hit the head on Facebook, tweeting several attacks

 NDA convenor and JDU president Sharad Yadav said that he does not agree with LK Advani, the working president of the opposition alliance and BJP leader, that there will be a non-bjp and non-congress prime minister in the next Lok Sabha elections
 yadav ne kaha, ‘laalkrishna adwani rajg ke kaaryakari adhyaksh hai
 But what he said above is based on fantasies and i do not follow fantasies
 chunaav baad samprag jayega or rajg kadaa muqabla degaa
 Advani has said in his blog released on Sunday that in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, a non-congress, non-bjp party will be the Prime Minister, although in such a system he will get the support of either of these two parties
 yadav ne kaha, ‘adwani varisht rajaneta hai or kai avasaron par tippaniyan karte hue vah party line se upar uth jate hai
 But i do not agree with his speculation
 ’adwani ne apane blog main gaiyr-congress, gaiyr-bhaajapa pradhanmantri kii baat aise samay kahi he jab rajg ke pramukh netaa or bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne bhaajapa se yah aashwaasan maanga he ki 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi ko rajg kii ore se pradhanmantri ke ummidavaar ke rup main pesh nahin kiya jayega
 Advani's statement is also seen as his Modi opposition
 kaha jaataa he ek samay tak modi ke pakke samarthak adwani ke in dinon unase achche rishte nahin hai
 Modi was being projected as the Prime Minister's contender for the last few days and it would certainly be a setback by Advani's said statement

 15 april 1917 ke din gandhi motihaari pahunche the
 Before coming to Motihari, neither knew the name of the district properly nor knew the way to reach there
 na unhone kabhi nil kaa paudha dekha tha
 On April 18, when Gandhi was going towards Motihari Court to tell him that he would not obey the order to leave the district, he would hear the agony of the farmers, then at that time two thousand farmers were walking with him
 do din ke bheetar do hazaar logon kii bheed bina whatsap ke, email ke or news channel kii madad ke, aap us vakt kii kalpana karenge to yakeen nahin hoga
 Gandhi neither knew Bhojpuri nor Hindi exactly
 ham is saal or is maheene champaran satyagrah kaa shatabdi varsh manaa rahe hai
 Every centenary of Gandhi's program, book and travels, has been celebrated for half a century, has been celebrated
 shaayad ham thik thik nahin jaanate ki gandhi ko kyon yaad karte hai or gandhi hone kaa matlab kya he
 There is only one meaning of being Gandhi
 bina hinsa kaa sahaara liye, bina kisi se madad kii ummid kiye, apane vakt kii sabase taqatvar sanstha or vyakti ke saamne tan kar khadey ho janaa gandhi hona he
 One who scares others while in power, who is afraid of power, both of these can only misuse Gandhi, not use it
 jabaki inhen donon ko sabase adhik gandhi kii zarurat he
 Gandhi reached Champaran and taught the most exploited peasants of that time to stand in front of the British rule without any violence
 unke aane ke pehle tak kisaan nil ke gore vyapaariyon se loha rahe the magar usamen hinsa thi
 There was not a single violence till Gandhi lived
 kahin bhi bhagdad nahin machi
 The discipline of non-violence was established
 jail kaa bhay samaapt ho gaya
 Gandhi put an end to the fear of jail from the hearts of millions of farmers
 champaran ke sau saal kii kamai yahi he ki aaj kaa kisaan phir se daraa hua he
 Is frightened and weakened against the bank's loan
 kisaanon kii aatmahatya kii khabaren ab na to kisi sampadak ko vichlit karti hai na ab koi pir mohammad munish he jo naukari khatare main daalkar kanpur se nikalne vaale pratap akhbaar ke liye champaran main kisaanon ke shoshan kii kahani bhej rahaa tha
 Nor is there any Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi student who can afford to call the story by printing the story of Champaran, form for the farmers there
 aaj kii patrakarita champaran satyagrah par kaise baat karegi
 Can she do it aaj ke kisaanon ko gandhi kaa intazaar nahin he
 He is waiting to be hanged
 nirvastr hokar kisaanon ko pradarshan karnaa padaa us jagah jahaan azaad bharat ke sabase taqatvar pradhanmantri kaa karyaalay he
 The police took them to the office to get the memorandum
 vahaan se lautate hue in kisaanon ne apane kapade utaar diye
 i can say with confidence that neither Delhi nor Hindustan has made a difference
 ye kisaan teen hafton se dilli main hai
 Suffering from drought and demanding relief
 kabhi ye chuha munh main dabaa lete hai to kabhi saanp
 How much farmers have to do to get the government's attention
 sarkaar ne tamilnadu ko 2014 karod rupee kii madad raashi bhi dene kaa elaan kiya he
 These farmers say that this amount is a drop in the bucket
 tamilnadu sarkaar ken se 39,000 karod kii madad maang rahi he
 When Gandhi reached Champaran in 1917, the farmers there were also undressed
 ek baar gandhi ne kasturba se kisi mahila kii taraf ishaara kar kaha ki unase puuchhiye ki unki sari itani maili kyon he
 The woman told Ba that i have only one sari
 nahaane ke liye koi duusari sari nahin he
 With two saris, you can clean the dirty sari
 champaran ke kisaan raaj kumaar shukla, shaikh ghulaam or sheethal raay ke netritv main ladaai lard rahe the magar unhen kisi aise kaa intazaar tha jo unki ladaai ko bada kar de
 Today, every fight of the farmers is shortened
 isliye champaran satyagrah motihaari main nahin tamilnadu, maharashtra or punjab main kisaanon ke bich manaaya janaa chahie tha
 But well 18 april se 16 july ke bich gandhi ke netritv main champaran ke 10,000 kisaanon ke bayaan liye gaye
 This will be the first public hearing in the history of India
 2015 main bharat ke 12,615 kisaanon ne aatmahatya kar lee, unki koi sunwaayee nahin ho paati he
 The peasants of Champaran were made slaves
 400 gore kisaan the magar 19 lakh kisaanon ko gulam bana liya tha
 To earn profits, farmers were asked to grow indigo on their own land as well
 wo apni marji se kuch uga nahin sakate the
 You will not be distracted by hearing the kind of taxes imposed on them
 fark nahin padataa he ke is jamaane main bataa dena chahie ki champaran ke kisaanon ko goli maar di jaati thi
 Had pierced the body with a spear
 ghar tod diye jate the taaki us zamin par nil kii kheti ho sake
 Tax was imposed, farmers should not irrigate their land, tax had to be paid
 prayek rupee par ek aana kaa lagaan tay tha
 Bentmafi tax had to be paid to keep the solution
 jab koi kisaan mar jaataa tha tab uski santan se maa baap ke naam par tex liya jaataa tha jise bapahi putahi tex kehete the
 The farmer who made the marwa for his daughter's wedding was also taxed for a quarter of a rupee
 holi or ramanavami kaa tyohaar manaane ke liye bhi use tex dena hota tha
 Such taxes were being collected from farmers, which you do not imagine, even today you continue to pay such taxes, you do not even know
 gulaami thi champaran main
 The farmers there were enslaved
 shoshan kaa itnaa bhayankar asar hua ki aaj bhi kai gharon main jashn nahin manata he
 Even if you celebrate happiness, be careful
 ham champaran satyagrah ke naam par na to gandhi ko jaanate hai or na hi vahaan or kahin ke kisaanon ko jaanate hai
 The magistrate of Faridpur EWH Tower had said that not a single box of indigo reaches England which is not stained with the blood of man
 us samay kii patrakarita bhi aaj ke samay kii patrakarita se milti he
 Many people were cheering the government, supporting the companies doing business of Neil, today's media is the partner of every company
 phir bhi kuch patrkaar the jo champaran kii gaatha logon tak pahunchaa rahe the
 There were some newspapers even then
 kanpur ke pratap akhbaar kii copy to champaran ke har ghar main honi chahie thi
 The interest of emanating from Nagpur also featured the story of Champaran's exploitation
 bihar se dainik bihari nikalataa tha jiske sampadak maheshwar prasad ne kitna jokhim liya
 Harvansha Sahay and Pir Mohammad Munish changed the name to Pratap
 pratap ne to champaran ke logon se apil karne ke liye ek parchaa chapa jiskaa naam tha prarthana
 Appeal was made to tell your story, give proof of it
 kai or akhbaar hai jinka naam lenaa sambhav nahin he
 Today's leader also visits someone and tweets his picture so that he can be seen working
 gandhi ne jab champaran ke kisaanon kii vyathaa sunani shuru ki akhabaaron ke sampadakon ko patr likhaa ki ve apane samvaadadaata na bhejein
 They will give whatever information they have
 gandhi ne likhaa ki champaran main sthiti itani najuk thi ki kinchit utsaahpurn aalochana yaa atiranjit khabaron se sahaj hi kaam main baari nuksaan pahunch saktaa he
 Today's journalism is openly spreading communalism, you think they are doing justice with some religion
 akhbaar tab bhi sampradayikta failaa rahe the
 Otherwise Bhagat Singh would not have to say
 phir bhi gandhi ne bina prachaar ke yah sab kiya or iskaa itnaa prachaar ho gaya ki yah aaj bhi communication ke lihaaz se ek dilachasp gaatha he
 Our acquaintance Arvind Mohan has written a good article in the Tadbhav magazine about communication and Gandhi during the Champaran Satyagraha, you can read
 april se november tak aate aate champaran ke kisaanon ko shoshan se mukti mil chuki thi
 But the leaders who went to Champaran with Gandhi were also freed from all kinds of fears
 tippaniyan Mazharul Haq sold every item of Aisho comfort from his house Alexander Manzil
 rajendra prasad, braj kishor prasad, sachchidanand sinha ye sab jo bade naam hai us vakt apane saamanti saz samanon ke saath gandhi kii madad karne gaye the
 While living in Champaran, he too became like Gandhi
 apana kaam karne lage
 Even started washing clothes
 champaran satyagrah kii kahani sirf sau saal puure hone kii kahani nahin he
 How can one forget Acharya GB Kripalani, Anugrah Babu
 gandhi ko champaran bulaane vaale rajkumaar shukla azaad bharat kaa suraj nahin dekh sake, gandhi azaad bharat main saadhe paanch maheene hi zindaa rah sake
 Were killed
 aaj unhen maarane vaale kii kuch log jayanti manaate hai
 We are joking in the name of Champaran Satyagraha
 manaa nahin rahe hai
 Through this, governments are promoting their programs but the farmer of Champaran is missing
 bharat kaa kisaan aatmahatya kar rahaa he yaa dilli main nirvastr hokar pradarshan kar rahaa he
 Even then the talk should continue
 maarane waalon kii bhi or maar diye jane vaale kii bhi
 The hundred years of the Champaran Satyagraha is the hundred years of our possibilities or the return of those fears
 gandhi hone kaa ek hi matlab he
 It is Gandhi to stand up in front of the most powerful institution and person of his time, without resorting to violence, without expecting help from anyone
 jo satta main rahakar dusron ko daraata he, jo satta se darataa he ye donon gandhi kaa durupyog hi kar sakate hai, upyog nahin
 Whereas both of them need Gandhi the most
 gandhi ne champaran pahunch kar bagair kisi hinsa ke us vakt ke sabase shoshit kisaanon ko british hukumat ke aage khadaa hona sikhaa diya
 Till his arrival, the farmers were fighting with the white traders of Neil, but there was violence in it
 gandhi jab tak rahe ek bhi hinsa nahin hui
 There was no stampede anywhere
 ahimsa kaa anushaasan kaayam ho gaya
 The fear of prison ended
 gandhi ne lakhon kisaanon ke man se jail kaa bhay samaapt kar diya
 The hundred years of Champaran's earnings is that today's farmer is scared again
 bhaybheet he or bank ke lone ke aage kamazor ho chukaa he
 The news of farmers' suicides now neither distracts any editor nor is there any Pir Mohammad Munish who was sending the story of exploitation of farmers in Champaran for the Pratap newspaper, which came out of Kanpur, putting the job in danger
 na hi koi ganesh shankar vidhyaarthee he jo champaran kii kahani chhap kar, vahaan ke kisaanon ke liye parchaa chhapakar kahani mangane kaa jokhim uthaa saktaa he
 How will today's journalism speak on Champaran Satyagraha
 kya wo kar sakati he
 Today's farmers are not waiting for Gandhi
 unhen faansee kaa intazaar rahata he
 Nudely, the peasants had to demonstrate at the place where the office of the most powerful Prime Minister of independent India is
 police inhen gyaapan dilwane ke liye karyaalay le gai thi
 Returning from there, these farmers took off their clothes
 yakeen se kah saktaa hum ki na dilli ko fark padaa na hindustan ko
 These farmers have been in Delhi for three weeks
 sookhe se peedit hai or raahat kii maang kar rahe hai
 Sometimes these mice press into the mouth and sometimes snakes
 kisaanon ko sarkaar kaa dhyaan khinchne ke liye kitna kuch karnaa padataa he
 The government has also announced a grant of Rs 2014 crore to Tamil Nadu
 in kisaanon kaa kahana he ki ye raashi baaltee main ek boond he
 The Government of Tamil Nadu is seeking help of 39,000 crores
 1917 main gandhi jab champaran pahunche to vahaan ke kisaan bhi vastraheen the
 Once Gandhi pointed to a woman from Kasturba and asked her why her sari is so dirty
 mahila ne ba ko bataaya ki mere paas ek hi sari he
 There is no other sari for bathing
 do sari hokar to maili sari saaf kar sakegi
 The farmers of Champaran were fighting a battle under the leadership of Raj Kumar Shukla, Sheikh Ghulam and Sheetal Rai, but they were waiting for someone who would make their fight bigger
 aaj kisaanon kii har ladaai choti kar di jaati he
 Hence the Champaran Satyagraha should have been celebrated among farmers in Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and Punjab, not in Motihari
 par kair
 Statements of 10,000 farmers of Champaran were taken from April 18 to July 16 under Gandhi's leadership
 bharat ke itihaas kii ye pehali jansunwaayee hogi
 In 2015, 12,615 farmers in India committed suicide, there is no hearing
 champaran ke kisaan gulam bana liye gaye the
 There were 400 white peasants but 19 lakh farmers were enslaved
 munafa kamaane ke liye kisaanon se unki apni zamin par bhi nil ugaakar dene ke liye kaha gaya
 They could not grow anything of their own accord
 un par jis tarah ke tex laade gaye wo sunakar bhi aap vichlit nahin honge
 It does not matter that at this time it should be said that the farmers of Champaran used to be shot
 barchhi se badan main chhed kar diya tha
 The houses were demolished so that indigo could be cultivated on that land
 pain tex laga, kisaan apni zamin kii sinchai kare na karen, tex dena padataa tha
 One rupee was fixed for every rupee
 hal rakhane ke liye bhi bentmaafee tex dena padataa tha
 When a farmer died, his child was taxed in the name of his parents, which was called Baphi Puthi Tax
 kisaan apni beti kii shaadi ke liye jo madva banavaata tha us par bhi sava rupee kaa tex lagata tha
 He was also required to pay tax to celebrate the festival of Holi and Ram Navami
 kisaanon se aise aise tex liye ja rahe the jisaki aap kalpana nahin karte, aaj bhi aap aise aise tex dete chalate hai, aapako pataa bhi nahin chalata he
 Slavery was in Champaran
 vahaan ke kisaanon ko das bana liya gaya tha
 Exploitation had such a terrible effect that even today many families do not celebrate
 khushi manaate bhi hai to sanbhal sanbhal kar
 In the name of Champaran Satyagraha, we neither know Gandhi nor do we know the farmers there and elsewhere
 faridpur ke majitrate i dablyoo ech tower ne kaha tha ki nil kaa ek bhi baksaa england nahin pahunchataa he jo aadmi ke koon se sanaa hua nahin he
 Journalism of that time also resembles the journalism of today
 bahut log sarkaar kii khushaamad kar rahe the, nil kaa kaarobaar karne vaali companiyon kaa saath de rahe the, aaj kaa media har company kaa saathi he
 Still there were some journalists who were bringing the saga of Champaran to the people
 kuch akhbaar tab bhi thi
 The copy of Pratap newspaper of Kanpur should have been in every house in Champaran
 nagpur se nikalne vaale hitwaad main bhi champaran ke shoshan kii kahani chapa karti thi
 The daily Bihari used to come out of Bihar, whose editor Maheshwar Prasad took so much risk
 harvansh sahay or pir mohammad munish ne naam badal kar pratap main likhaa
 Pratap even printed a pamphlet called Prayer to appeal to the people of Champaran
 apil kii gai thi ki apni kahani bataayen, uskaa pramaan den
 There are many other newspapers whose name is not possible
 aaj kaa netaa kisi se mulaakaat bhi karata he to uski tasviir twit kar detaa he taaki wo kaam karata hue dikhe
 When Gandhi started hearing the agony of the farmers of Champaran, he wrote letters to the editors of newspapers not to send their correspondents
 jo bhi soochna hogi ve swayan de denge
 Gandhi wrote that the situation in Champaran was so critical that a small amount of enthusiastic criticism or exaggerated news could easily result in a huge loss of work
 aaj kii patrakarita khuleam sampradayikta failaa rahi he, aap samajhate hai ki ve kisi mazahab ke saath insaaf kar rahe hai
 Newspapers were still spreading communalism
 varna bhagat singh ko kahana na padataa
 Yet Gandhi did all this without publicity and it got so much publicity that even today it is an interesting saga in terms of communication
 hamaare parichit arvind mohan ne tadbhav patrika main champaran satyagrah ke vakt communication or gandhi ko lekar acha lekh likhaa he, aap pard sakate hai
 Coming from April to November, Champaran farmers had got rid of exploitation
 lekin gandhi ke saath champaran gaye netaaon ko bhi tarah tarah ke dar se mukti mil gai thi
 The comments mazaharul haq ne apane ghar sikandar manzil se aisho aaraam ke har saamaan ko bech diya
 Rajendra Prasad, Braj Kishore Prasad, Sachchidanand Sinha, all of whom are big names, had gone to help Gandhi with his feudal Saaz Samanas at that time
 champaran main rahete rahete ve bhi gandhi kii tarah ho gaye
 Started doing his work
 kapade tak dhone lage
 The story of Champaran Satyagraha is not just the story of completing a hundred years
 acharya ji bi kriplani, anugrah babu ko kaise bhuulaa ja saktaa he
 Rajkumar Shukla Azad, who called Gandhi to Champaran, could not see the sun of India, Gandhi Azad could live in India for only five and a half months
 maar die gaye
 Today some people celebrate their birth anniversary
 ham champaran satyagrah ke naam par mazaaq kar rahe hai
 Are not celebrating iske zariye sarkarein apane kaaryakramon kaa prachaar kar rahi hai magar champaran kaa kisaan gaayab he
 The farmer of India is committing suicide or performing nakedly in Delhi
 phir bhi baat hoti rahani chahie
 Also those who kill and those who kill
 champaran satyagrah kaa sau saal hamaari sambhaavnaaon kaa sau saal he yaa unheen ashankaon kii vaapasi kaa saal he
 Gandhi reached Champaran and taught the most exploited peasants of that time to stand in front of the British rule without any violence
 unke aane ke pehle tak kisaan nil ke gore vyapaariyon se loha rahe the magar usamen hinsa thi
 There was not a single violence till Gandhi lived
 kahin bhi bhagdad nahin machi
 The discipline of non-violence was established
 jail kaa bhay samaapt ho gaya
 Gandhi put an end to the fear of jail from the hearts of millions of farmers
 champaran ke sau saal kii kamai yahi he ki aaj kaa kisaan phir se daraa hua he
 Is frightened and weakened against the bank's loan
 kisaanon kii aatmahatya kii khabaren ab na to kisi sampadak ko vichlit karti hai na ab koi pir mohammad munish he jo naukari khatare main daalkar kanpur se nikalne vaale pratap akhbaar ke liye champaran main kisaanon ke shoshan kii kahani bhej rahaa tha
 Nor is there any Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi student who can afford to call the story by printing the story of Champaran, form for the farmers there
 aaj kii patrakarita champaran satyagrah par kaise baat karegi
 Can she do it aaj ke kisaanon ko gandhi kaa intazaar nahin he
 He is waiting to be hanged
 nirvastr hokar kisaanon ko pradarshan karnaa padaa us jagah jahaan azaad bharat ke sabase taqatvar pradhanmantri kaa karyaalay he
 The police took them to the office to get the memorandum
 vahaan se lautate hue in kisaanon ne apane kapade utaar diye
 i can say with confidence that neither Delhi nor Hindustan has made a difference
 ye kisaan teen hafton se dilli main hai
 Suffering from drought and demanding relief
 kabhi ye chuha munh main dabaa lete hai to kabhi saanp
 How much farmers have to do to get the government's attention
 sarkaar ne tamilnadu ko 2014 karod rupee kii madad raashi bhi dene kaa elaan kiya he
 These farmers say that this amount is a drop in the bucket
 tamilnadu sarkaar ken se 39,000 karod kii madad maang rahi he
 When Gandhi reached Champaran in 1917, the farmers there were also undressed
 ek baar gandhi ne kasturba se kisi mahila kii taraf ishaara kar kaha ki unase puuchhiye ki unki sari itani maili kyon he
 The woman told Ba that i have only one sari
 nahaane ke liye koi duusari sari nahin he
 With two saris, you can clean the dirty sari
 champaran ke kisaan raaj kumaar shukla, shaikh ghulaam or sheethal raay ke netritv main ladaai lard rahe the magar unhen kisi aise kaa intazaar tha jo unki ladaai ko bada kar de
 Today, every fight of the farmers is shortened
 isliye champaran satyagrah motihaari main nahin tamilnadu, maharashtra or punjab main kisaanon ke bich manaaya janaa chahie tha
 But well 18 april se 16 july ke bich gandhi ke netritv main champaran ke 10,000 kisaanon ke bayaan liye gaye
 This will be the first public hearing in the history of India
 2015 main bharat ke 12,615 kisaanon ne aatmahatya kar lee, unki koi sunwaayee nahin ho paati he
 The peasants of Champaran were made slaves
 400 gore kisaan the magar 19 lakh kisaanon ko gulam bana liya tha
 To earn profits, farmers were asked to grow indigo on their own land as well
 wo apni marji se kuch uga nahin sakate the
 You will not be distracted by hearing the kind of taxes imposed on them
 fark nahin padataa he ke is jamaane main bataa dena chahie ki champaran ke kisaanon ko goli maar di jaati thi
 Had pierced the body with a spear
 ghar tod diye jate the taaki us zamin par nil kii kheti ho sake
 Tax was imposed, farmers should not irrigate their land, tax had to be paid
 prayek rupee par ek aana kaa lagaan tay tha
 Bentmafi tax had to be paid to keep the solution
 jab koi kisaan mar jaataa tha tab uski santan se maa baap ke naam par tex liya jaataa tha jise bapahi putahi tex kehete the
 The farmer who made the marwa for his daughter's wedding was also taxed for a quarter of a rupee
 holi or ramanavami kaa tyohaar manaane ke liye bhi use tex dena hota tha
 Such taxes were being collected from farmers, which you do not imagine, even today you continue to pay such taxes, you do not even know
 gulaami thi champaran main
 The farmers there were enslaved
 shoshan kaa itnaa bhayankar asar hua ki aaj bhi kai gharon main jashn nahin manata he
 Even if you celebrate happiness, be careful
 ham champaran satyagrah ke naam par na to gandhi ko jaanate hai or na hi vahaan or kahin ke kisaanon ko jaanate hai
 The magistrate of Faridpur EWH Tower had said that not a single box of indigo reaches England which is not stained with the blood of man
 us samay kii patrakarita bhi aaj ke samay kii patrakarita se milti he
 Many people were cheering the government, supporting the companies doing business of Neil, today's media is the partner of every company
 phir bhi kuch patrkaar the jo champaran kii gaatha logon tak pahunchaa rahe the
 There were some newspapers even then
 kanpur ke pratap akhbaar kii copy to champaran ke har ghar main honi chahie thi
 The interest of emanating from Nagpur also featured the story of Champaran's exploitation
 bihar se dainik bihari nikalataa tha jiske sampadak maheshwar prasad ne kitna jokhim liya
 Harvansha Sahay and Pir Mohammad Munish changed the name to Pratap
 pratap ne to champaran ke logon se apil karne ke liye ek parchaa chapa jiskaa naam tha prarthana
 Appeal was made to tell your story, give proof of it
 kai or akhbaar hai jinka naam lenaa sambhav nahin he
 Today's leader also visits someone and tweets his picture so that he can be seen working
 gandhi ne jab champaran ke kisaanon kii vyathaa sunani shuru ki akhabaaron ke sampadakon ko patr likhaa ki ve apane samvaadadaata na bhejein
 They will give whatever information they have
 gandhi ne likhaa ki champaran main sthiti itani najuk thi ki kinchit utsaahpurn aalochana yaa atiranjit khabaron se sahaj hi kaam main baari nuksaan pahunch saktaa he
 Today's journalism is openly spreading communalism, you think they are doing justice with some religion
 akhbaar tab bhi sampradayikta failaa rahe the
 Otherwise Bhagat Singh would not have to say
 phir bhi gandhi ne bina prachaar ke yah sab kiya or iskaa itnaa prachaar ho gaya ki yah aaj bhi communication ke lihaaz se ek dilachasp gaatha he
 Our acquaintance Arvind Mohan has written a good article in the Tadbhav magazine about communication and Gandhi during the Champaran Satyagraha, you can read
 april se november tak aate aate champaran ke kisaanon ko shoshan se mukti mil chuki thi
 But the leaders who went to Champaran with Gandhi were also freed from all kinds of fears
 tippaniyan Mazharul Haq sold every item of Aisho comfort from his house Alexander Manzil
 rajendra prasad, braj kishor prasad, sachchidanand sinha ye sab jo bade naam hai us vakt apane saamanti saz samanon ke saath gandhi kii madad karne gaye the
 While living in Champaran, he too became like Gandhi
 apana kaam karne lage
 Even started washing clothes
 champaran satyagrah kii kahani sirf sau saal puure hone kii kahani nahin he
 How can one forget Acharya GB Kripalani, Anugrah Babu
 gandhi ko champaran bulaane vaale rajkumaar shukla azaad bharat kaa suraj nahin dekh sake, gandhi azaad bharat main saadhe paanch maheene hi zindaa rah sake
 Were killed
 aaj unhen maarane vaale kii kuch log jayanti manaate hai
 We are joking in the name of Champaran Satyagraha
 manaa nahin rahe hai
 Through this, governments are promoting their programs but the farmer of Champaran is missing
 bharat kaa kisaan aatmahatya kar rahaa he yaa dilli main nirvastr hokar pradarshan kar rahaa he
 Even then the talk should continue
 maarane waalon kii bhi or maar diye jane vaale kii bhi
 The hundred years of the Champaran Satyagraha is the hundred years of our possibilities or the return of those fears

 gandhi ko champaran bulaane vaale rajkumaar shukla azaad bharat kaa suraj nahin dekh sake, gandhi azaad bharat main saadhe paanch maheene hi zindaa rah sake
 Were killed
 aaj unhen maarane vaale kii kuch log jayanti manaate hai
 We are joking in the name of Champaran Satyagraha
 manaa nahin rahe hai
 Through this, governments are promoting their programs but the farmer of Champaran is missing
 bharat kaa kisaan aatmahatya kar rahaa he yaa dilli main nirvastr hokar pradarshan kar rahaa he
 Even then the talk should continue
 maarane waalon kii bhi or maar diye jane vaale kii bhi
 The hundred years of the Champaran Satyagraha is the hundred years of our possibilities or the return of those fears
 1917 main gandhi jab champaran pahunche to vahaan ke kisaan bhi vastraheen the
 Once Gandhi pointed to a woman from Kasturba and asked her why her sari is so dirty
 mahila ne ba ko bataaya ki mere paas ek hi sari he
 There is no other sari for bathing
 do sari hokar to maili sari saaf kar sakegi
 The farmers of Champaran were fighting a battle under the leadership of Raj Kumar Shukla, Sheikh Ghulam and Sheetal Rai, but they were waiting for someone who would make their fight bigger
 aaj kisaanon kii har ladaai choti kar di jaati he
 Hence the Champaran Satyagraha should have been celebrated among farmers in Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and Punjab, not in Motihari
 par kair
 Statements of 10,000 farmers of Champaran were taken from April 18 to July 16 under Gandhi's leadership
 bharat ke itihaas kii ye pehali jansunwaayee hogi
 In 2015, 12,615 farmers in India committed suicide, there is no hearing
 champaran ke kisaan gulam bana liye gaye the
 There were 400 white peasants but 19 lakh farmers were enslaved
 munafa kamaane ke liye kisaanon se unki apni zamin par bhi nil ugaakar dene ke liye kaha gaya
 They could not grow anything of their own accord
 un par jis tarah ke tex laade gaye wo sunakar bhi aap vichlit nahin honge
 It does not matter that at this time it should be said that the farmers of Champaran used to be shot
 barchhi se badan main chhed kar diya tha
 The houses were demolished so that indigo could be cultivated on that land
 pain tex laga, kisaan apni zamin kii sinchai kare na karen, tex dena padataa tha
 One rupee was fixed for every rupee
 hal rakhane ke liye bhi bentmaafee tex dena padataa tha
 When a farmer died, his child was taxed in the name of his parents, which was called Baphi Puthi Tax
 kisaan apni beti kii shaadi ke liye jo madva banavaata tha us par bhi sava rupee kaa tex lagata tha
 He was also required to pay tax to celebrate the festival of Holi and Ram Navami
 kisaanon se aise aise tex liye ja rahe the jisaki aap kalpana nahin karte, aaj bhi aap aise aise tex dete chalate hai, aapako pataa bhi nahin chalata he
 Slavery was in Champaran
 vahaan ke kisaanon ko das bana liya gaya tha
 Exploitation had such a terrible effect that even today many families do not celebrate
 khushi manaate bhi hai to sanbhal sanbhal kar
 In the name of Champaran Satyagraha, we neither know Gandhi nor do we know the farmers there and elsewhere
 faridpur ke majitrate i dablyoo ech tower ne kaha tha ki nil kaa ek bhi baksaa england nahin pahunchataa he jo aadmi ke koon se sanaa hua nahin he
 Journalism of that time also resembles the journalism of today
 bahut log sarkaar kii khushaamad kar rahe the, nil kaa kaarobaar karne vaali companiyon kaa saath de rahe the, aaj kaa media har company kaa saathi he
 Still there were some journalists who were bringing the saga of Champaran to the people
 kuch akhbaar tab bhi thi
 The copy of Pratap newspaper of Kanpur should have been in every house in Champaran
 nagpur se nikalne vaale hitwaad main bhi champaran ke shoshan kii kahani chapa karti thi
 The daily Bihari used to come out of Bihar, whose editor Maheshwar Prasad took so much risk
 harvansh sahay or pir mohammad munish ne naam badal kar pratap main likhaa
 Pratap even printed a pamphlet called Prayer to appeal to the people of Champaran
 apil kii gai thi ki apni kahani bataayen, uskaa pramaan den
 There are many other newspapers whose name is not possible
 aaj kaa netaa kisi se mulaakaat bhi karata he to uski tasviir twit kar detaa he taaki wo kaam karata hue dikhe
 When Gandhi started hearing the agony of the farmers of Champaran, he wrote letters to the editors of newspapers not to send their correspondents
 jo bhi soochna hogi ve swayan de denge
 Gandhi wrote that the situation in Champaran was so critical that a small amount of enthusiastic criticism or exaggerated news could easily result in a huge loss of work
 aaj kii patrakarita khuleam sampradayikta failaa rahi he, aap samajhate hai ki ve kisi mazahab ke saath insaaf kar rahe hai
 Newspapers were still spreading communalism
 varna bhagat singh ko kahana na padataa
 Yet Gandhi did all this without publicity and it got so much publicity that even today it is an interesting saga in terms of communication
 hamaare parichit arvind mohan ne tadbhav patrika main champaran satyagrah ke vakt communication or gandhi ko lekar acha lekh likhaa he, aap pard sakate hai
 Coming from April to November, Champaran farmers had got rid of exploitation
 lekin gandhi ke saath champaran gaye netaaon ko bhi tarah tarah ke dar se mukti mil gai thi
 The comments mazaharul haq ne apane ghar sikandar manzil se aisho aaraam ke har saamaan ko bech diya
 Rajendra Prasad, Braj Kishore Prasad, Sachchidanand Sinha, all of whom are big names, had gone to help Gandhi with his feudal Saaz Samanas at that time
 champaran main rahete rahete ve bhi gandhi kii tarah ho gaye
 Started doing his work
 kapade tak dhone lage
 The story of Champaran Satyagraha is not just the story of completing a hundred years
 acharya ji bi kriplani, anugrah babu ko kaise bhuulaa ja saktaa he
 Rajkumar Shukla Azad, who called Gandhi to Champaran, could not see the sun of India, Gandhi Azad could live in India for only five and a half months
 maar die gaye
 Today some people celebrate their birth anniversary
 ham champaran satyagrah ke naam par mazaaq kar rahe hai
 Are not celebrating iske zariye sarkarein apane kaaryakramon kaa prachaar kar rahi hai magar champaran kaa kisaan gaayab he
 The farmer of India is committing suicide or performing nakedly in Delhi
 phir bhi baat hoti rahani chahie
 Also those who kill and those who kill
 champaran satyagrah kaa sau saal hamaari sambhaavnaaon kaa sau saal he yaa unheen ashankaon kii vaapasi kaa saal he

 Also those who kill and those who kill
 champaran satyagrah kaa sau saal hamaari sambhaavnaaon kaa sau saal he yaa unheen ashankaon kii vaapasi kaa saal he
 Tax was imposed, farmers should not irrigate their land, tax had to be paid
 prayek rupee par ek aana kaa lagaan tay tha
 Bentmafi tax had to be paid to keep the solution
 jab koi kisaan mar jaataa tha tab uski santan se maa baap ke naam par tex liya jaataa tha jise bapahi putahi tex kehete the
 The farmer who made the marwa for his daughter's wedding was also taxed for a quarter of a rupee
 holi or ramanavami kaa tyohaar manaane ke liye bhi use tex dena hota tha
 Such taxes were being collected from farmers, which you do not imagine, even today you continue to pay such taxes, you do not even know
 gulaami thi champaran main
 The farmers there were enslaved
 shoshan kaa itnaa bhayankar asar hua ki aaj bhi kai gharon main jashn nahin manata he
 Even if you celebrate happiness, be careful
 ham champaran satyagrah ke naam par na to gandhi ko jaanate hai or na hi vahaan or kahin ke kisaanon ko jaanate hai
 The magistrate of Faridpur EWH Tower had said that not a single box of indigo reaches England which is not stained with the blood of man
 us samay kii patrakarita bhi aaj ke samay kii patrakarita se milti he
 Many people were cheering the government, supporting the companies doing business of Neil, today's media is the partner of every company
 phir bhi kuch patrkaar the jo champaran kii gaatha logon tak pahunchaa rahe the
 There were some newspapers even then
 kanpur ke pratap akhbaar kii copy to champaran ke har ghar main honi chahie thi
 The interest of emanating from Nagpur also featured the story of Champaran's exploitation
 bihar se dainik bihari nikalataa tha jiske sampadak maheshwar prasad ne kitna jokhim liya
 Harvansha Sahay and Pir Mohammad Munish changed the name to Pratap
 pratap ne to champaran ke logon se apil karne ke liye ek parchaa chapa jiskaa naam tha prarthana
 Appeal was made to tell your story, give proof of it
 kai or akhbaar hai jinka naam lenaa sambhav nahin he
 Today's leader also visits someone and tweets his picture so that he can be seen working
 gandhi ne jab champaran ke kisaanon kii vyathaa sunani shuru ki akhabaaron ke sampadakon ko patr likhaa ki ve apane samvaadadaata na bhejein
 They will give whatever information they have
 gandhi ne likhaa ki champaran main sthiti itani najuk thi ki kinchit utsaahpurn aalochana yaa atiranjit khabaron se sahaj hi kaam main baari nuksaan pahunch saktaa he
 Today's journalism is openly spreading communalism, you think they are doing justice with some religion
 akhbaar tab bhi sampradayikta failaa rahe the
 Otherwise Bhagat Singh would not have to say
 phir bhi gandhi ne bina prachaar ke yah sab kiya or iskaa itnaa prachaar ho gaya ki yah aaj bhi communication ke lihaaz se ek dilachasp gaatha he
 Our acquaintance Arvind Mohan has written a good article in the Tadbhav magazine about communication and Gandhi during the Champaran Satyagraha, you can read
 april se november tak aate aate champaran ke kisaanon ko shoshan se mukti mil chuki thi
 But the leaders who went to Champaran with Gandhi were also freed from all kinds of fears
 tippaniyan Mazharul Haq sold every item of Aisho comfort from his house Alexander Manzil
 rajendra prasad, braj kishor prasad, sachchidanand sinha ye sab jo bade naam hai us vakt apane saamanti saz samanon ke saath gandhi kii madad karne gaye the
 While living in Champaran, he too became like Gandhi
 apana kaam karne lage
 Even started washing clothes
 champaran satyagrah kii kahani sirf sau saal puure hone kii kahani nahin he
 How can one forget Acharya GB Kripalani, Anugrah Babu

 bharat main televijan ke itihaas kii kahani doordarshan ke itihaas se hi shuru hoti he

 He said that the Bharatiya Janata Party made an OBC caste of chai wala prime minister

 Notorious for copying, this time there is a different atmosphere in UP
 board parikshaon main nakal rokane ke liye sakhti itani zyaada he ki lakhon chaatr jahaan pariksha shuru hone ke pehle hafte main hi pariksha chhod chuke hai, vahiin aise chaatro kii bhi kami nahin he ki jinhen imtehaan dene main saansen phool rahi hai
 In fact, this time the UP board has installed CCTV cameras in every examination center, while accountability has been fixed from teacher and principal to DM and police captain of the district
 aise hatkande apana rahe hai nakalchi chaatrapariksha ke dauraan jab jaanch shuru hui to kahin tabeez main chipa microphone
 Somewhere, Guruji was found distributing fennel among the students
 kahin bluetooth ke sahare nakal kaa jugad saamne aayaa to kahin tamaam paabandiyon ke baavjood nakal kii koshish karte chaatr najar aae
 Overall, there was a lot of trouble for imitators
 sarkari kii sakhti se darkar bhaage nakalchiuttar pradesh ke skulon main ab tak padhai kisi hoti thi, ye to har kisi ko pataa he
 But this time the government is going to do such a strong action to stop cheating in the board exams, it was probably not known to everyone
 tabhi to parikshaon kii shuruyaat hote hi ek taraf jahaan nakal maffia kii hawa kharaab ho chuki he, vahiin daal naa galati dekh kar pariksha shuru hote hi 5 lakh 90 hazaar 830 se zyaada chaatr parikshaon se hi bhaag gaye
 You can call it a yogi effect on up's education system or something else, but this time the government has shown strictness to stop cheating in the board exams, rarely before
 nakal rokane ke kade intjamnakal rokane ke liye sarkaar kii taiyaari kisi he, ye jaanane ke liye is baar board parikshaon se jude intazaamon par ek nigaah daalana hi kaafii he
 Uttar Pradesh Secondary Education Council, one of the largest education boards in the country, claims to have a copy-free examination every year, but they know how complete this claim is
 lekin is baar maamla thodaa alag he
 Decreased the number of examination centers, 66 lakh 37 thousand 18 students are appearing in the state this time, but this time the centers of examinations have been reduced to 8 thousand 549 as compared to last year's 11 thousand 415, so that the full capacity of all centers Can be used and monitoring of examinations is easily possible
 lekin is koshish main upi board kaa sabase bada kadam he, sabhi pariksha kendron main vakt rahete laga liye gaye sisitivi camere
 Needless to say that a person can be tricked into catching a rigged person, but the camera cannot cheat
 8549 pariksha kendron par CCTV camereis baar board kii metric parikshaon main kul 36 lakh 55 hazaar 691 chaatr bhaag rahe hai
 While a total of 29 lakh 81 thousand 327 students in intermediate examinations
 yani is saal imtehaan main bhaag lene vaale kul chaatro kii taadaad 66 lakh 37 hazaar 18 he
 But this time CCTV cameras are installed in all 8,549 examination centers
 har zile ko super zone, zone or sectors main baanta gaya he
 The deployment of heavy police force at the examination centers has been fixed with accountability ranging from DM to SSP and from SH to constable
 har cirkil mukhyalay par kuarti kii tainaati kii gai he
 Each center has the duty of one constable and three policemen ie 34,196 policemen

 Sonu, who hails from Rohtak, has a long-standing relationship with crime

 aise main rahul camp kaa baichaiyn hona laazmi tha
 Also, on December 27, Rahul had to face the media, in which the question was bound to arise
 
 In the meantime, any step or statement of Sheila could have hurt Rahul's credibility

 Then on 26 December Kanishka Singh went to Sheela's house and met her

 After that, Auntie Sheila agreed and ended up, what was the concern of Rahul? Sheila, who was loyal to the Gandhi family, agreed, for Rahul's sake
 vaise bhi rahul, priyanka se lekar kanishka tak shila ko antee pukaarte rahe hai, to antee ne bhi apane bacchon ko niraash nahin kiya
 By tweeting the matter of the investigation, the way was opened for Rahul, and on December 28, he announced through Twitter that he was going to the political program of UP and tried to show that everything is fine

 iske teen minute baad germany ke mesut ojil kii carnor kik par arne federick kaa header cross baar se takaraakar mular ke paas pahunchaa jinka shaat urugway ke dephender martin kaseres ne roak diya

 12 agast 2011 main dilli hai court ke aadesh par abhibhavakon ko privet skulon se badhaakar vasuuli gai fees ko waapas karne ke liye anil dev singh cameti gathit kii gai thi
 Nearly 8 years are nearing completion, but parents still have not received the additional fees recovered from the schools in 2011
 anil dev singh cameti ne apni report main court ko bataaya he ki vasuul kiye jane vaali ye rakam kareeb 750 karod rupye hai
 Now the committee has applied in the Delhi High Court, saying that it needs more time till December this year to complete its investigation
 hai court ne is par dilli sarkaar ko notice bhejkar 22 april tak jawaab dene ko kaha he
 Since 2011, the Anil Dev Singh Committee has presented 13 interim reports in the court
 in reports main cameti ne jo chijen ujagar kii hai ve chaunkaane vaali to hai hi saath hi system or sarkaar par sawaal khadey karne vaali bhi hai
 The committee has told in its report in the court that it has inspected about 1100 private schools
 isamen 604 privet skool aise hai jinako 750 karod rupye abhibhavakon ko lautaane hai jo ki unase badi hui fees ke naam par vasule gaye the
 Every school has to refund the increased fees from about one million rupees to 20 crores to the parents, but the schools constantly want to avoid giving money by dragging the matter in court
 in 604 schools main se bamushkil 3 se 4 schoolo ne hi kuch paise abhibhavakon ko waapas kiye hai
 Most of the big and famous schools have challenged the High Court order in double bench instead of returning this money
 is yachika par agali sunwaayee 12 july ko honi he
 The committee has also told in its report that during the investigation of about 200 schools, he found such whose records were bogus
 in skulon main abhibhavakon se liye gaye paise kaa record rakhane ke liye register tak nahin banaae gaye hai
 The most surprising thing is that these 200 schools do not even have their own bank accounts
 jabaki bina bank acount khulawaayen privet skulon ko manyata hi nahin di ja sakati he
 Apart from this, it is also mandatory for schools to keep 3 months advance salary of teachers in bank account
 aise main adhikari or sarkaar se jude logon kii mileebhagat ke bagaiyr yah skool naa to chal sakate the or naa hi ne manyata di ja sakati thi
 The first petition was filed in Delhi High Court on 8 September 1997 by senior advocate Ashok Aggarwal to challenge the increased fees of private schools in India
 do dashak se upar kaa samay bitne ke baad bhi abhibhavakon ke haath khaali hai
 The hand of Justice Santosh Duggal Committee, formed at that time, could not find anything special against private schools
 lihaaja abhibhavakon kaa 400 karod rupaya privet skool hadap kar gaye
 Anil Dev Singh Committee, which has been working for 8 years, now has to get 750 crore rupees to parents
 lekin philhal ke halaat dekhakar yah hota hua bhi aasaan najar nahin aa rahaa he
 When Anil Dev Singh Committee was constituted 8 years ago, 3 members were placed in it, in addition to Justice Anil Dev, CA GS Kochhar and educationist RK Sharma were included
 iske alaava 10 logon ko offis staff ke taur par niyukt kiya gaya tha
 In these 8 years, crores of rupees have been spent on this committee itself
 cameti ke kharche dilli sarkaar privet skulon se hi vasuul rahi he or yah bataane kii jarurat nahin ki privet skool yah rakam fees kii shakl main abhibhavakon se hi vasuul rahe hai
 But the parents are still awaiting their refund of the increased fees

 ' unhone aage kaha, 'mehnat karne vaale or madhyam vargeey logon kii sefti net par tex lagaana naitik rup se galat he or sarkaar kii janvirohi maansikta ko darshata he
 BJP made fun of this statement by the BJP

 Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav has played a big bet before the assembly elections
 akhilesh cabinet ne obisi ke daayre main aane vaali 17 jatiyon ko anusuchit jati yani dalit cote main shaamil kiye jane par muhar laga di he
 Political pundits are surprised by the ruling Samajwadi Party's move in the state
 piem narendra modi or congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi upi main sabhaayen kar rahe hai or notebandi ke masale par donon ke bich siyaasi shabdabaan chal rahe hai
 In the meantime, trying to make himself an image as a 'development man', CM Akhilesh Yadav's 'caste card' comes as a surprise
 akhilesh sarkaar ne aisa kyon kiya?soobe main agle saal chunaav hone hai
 In such a situation, this step of Akhilesh government is being considered as a decision to woo these castes in the wake of elections
 in jatiyon ko dalit cote main shaamil kiye jane se inhen sarkari naukariyon main aarakshan kaa phayda hoga
 The vote bank of these 17 castes in UP is 14 percent
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main inamen se zyaadaatar ne bijepi ke samarthan main vot diya tha
 Samajwadi Party wants to drag them into its court in the assembly elections
 kyonki ye jatiyaan soobe main kareeb 250 vidhansabha siton ke nateezon par asar daalati hai

 But now they have started talking about 'cast' i
e

 upi vidhansabha ke monsoon satr ke aakhri din yani ek sitambar 2016 ko akhilesh yadav ne kaha tha, ‘yah sach he ki jati or dharm ke sameekaran kaam karte hai, lekin apane sameekaran thik karne ke bajaay aapako vikaas ke bare main baat kerani chahie
 People should choose people who talk about development
 ’vahiin 21 disambar ko bhi siem akhilesh ne kuch aisa hi kaha tha, 'jati ke aadhaar par raajnneeti ke din ab puure ho gaye hai
 Now only two 'D' matters and that is development and demonetization (development and demonetisation)
 koi bhi vyakti partiyon ke bheetar gutbaji yaa cabinet main hue pherbadal kii baaten nahin kar rahaa
 People will vote for us after seeing the work of the last five years
 notebandi ke kaaran logon ko jis tarah kii dikkaton kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he, wo bhi hamen jeet dilaane main madad karegaa
 The long lines in front of banks and atms will be the voters of the Samajwadi Party tomorrow

 It will be decided that Alpesh's future, both the candidates of Radhanpur in the state, Alpesh Thakor and Radhu Desai, could not vote here, because both are not local and their vote does not come in this region
 radhanpur seat isliye bhi ahm he kyonki vidhansabha chunaav main congress kii tikat par jitkar aae alpesh thakor ab puraani party chhod bijepi se chunaav lard rahe hai

 The top teams in the world like Germany, Australia and the Netherlands are very strong in the fundamental skills of the game
 
 
 " On the Indian players' inclination towards the Australian coach, Dwyer said in a funny tone that it seems that he is extremely attracted to it
 haal hi main bhartiya hockey team ke australian coach maaikel nobs ko hataakar australia ke hi terry walsh ko nayaa coach niyukt kiya gaya he
 Dwyer said, "seriously, Terry is a very good coach, and i hope that under his guidance the Indian team will be able to learn the appropriate system of the game

 Before forming the government of BJP and PDP in Jammu and Kashmir, the Central Government has made it clear that it has no intention of tampering Article 370

 This is also important because soon Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Mufti Mohammad Sayeed are about to meet the intricacies of the state before forming the government

 Whatever the name, it is to see how much one party bends before the other and to what extent it is able to give a stable government to the people of Jammu and Kashmir

 Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar gave cash as a reward to those informing about such incidents, amidst appeals to stop the burning of stubble in the neighboring states of Delhi which turned into a 'gas chamber' due to air pollution
 Announced on Friday
 unhone adhikariyon ko nirdesh diya ki ve kisaanon ko anya vikalp apnaane ke liye protsaahit karen
 According to an official release issued here, Khattar met officials to review the crop residue management (CRM) scheme in his state
 vijyapti main kaha gaya ki khatter ne krishi evam kisaan kalyaan vibhaag ke adhikariyon se un 10 gaanvon kaa daura karne ko kaha jahaan paraali jalaane kii sarvaadhik ghatnaayen hui he

 isamen kaha gaya ki apane ilaake main is prakaar kii ghatnaon kii soochna dene vaale ko 1000 rupye inaam diya jayega or unki pahchaan gupt rakhi jaaegi
 It is noteworthy that a thick sheet of stagnant haze enveloped the sky in Delhi and adjoining areas on Friday and the air quality reached a dangerous "severe" category
 iske baad ipisie ne ‘saarvajanik swasthya apaat sthiti' ghoshit kar di
 In Andhra Pradesh, he held the post longer than any other Chief Minister - more than nine years and, to say the right, 3,378 days
 lekin en
 Chandrababu Naidu's opponents never let him forget that he had not earned the post
 unhone yah pad apane sasur or telegu desham party (tidipi) ke sansthaapak en
 T
 ramarao ko apdasth karke liya tha
 His critics called him a "stabber in the back"
 isliye yah uchit hi jaan padaa ki votaron ne may, 2004 main unhen pradesh ke 13wein mukhyamantri ke rup main pad se hataa diya
 Since then, in the last ten years, Chandrababu Naidu spent time wandering in the politics of opposition
 ab unhen apni vaapasi kii puri ummid he
 Conditions are not favorable to him, but Naidu, a 63-year-old astute strategist, has pursued his prospect with great caution
 unhone ek dashak ke baad bijepi se phir gathbandhan kiya he
 They are hoping that the resources of the NDA and the Modi wave will overwhelm their fleet
 unki tidipi pehali aisi party thi, jisane telegu navvarsh ke din 31 march ko ugadee ke maukey par kshetra-vishesh ke vaadon ke saath ek saamaajik telugana or swarna andhra pradesh ke liye alag-alag ghoshnaa-patr jari kiya
 He has been trying all these years to keep his supporters united, to stay connected with the voters and to target his political rivals
 naidu kehete hai, “satta kii raajnneeti shatranj ke khel kii tarah he
 You play tricks and counter-moves, winning in some and losing in some
 ” unhen yakeen he ki unki sabase nai chaal unhen jitaane vaali he
 He says, “the TDP-BJP alliance will strengthen which will form stable governments at the Center as well as at the states
 yah dharna ban rahi he ki modi vikaas ke paksh main hai or ve gujarat main apane pradarshan ko rashtriya str par doharaaenge
 "if his strategy fits well, Naidu will come very close to power
 lekin unhen pehle se chote or is tarah rajnatik rup se kam mahatvapurn rajya se santosh karnaa hoga
 But they cannot complain
 yah sab unki party kaa kiya-dharaa he
 He lost the advantage of 1999 by not taking decisive steps on the Telangana issue, when the TDP-BJP alliance won 36 out of 42 Lok Sabha seats in the undivided state
 iske baad jab ve satta se baahar ho gaye to rajya ke vibhaajan kii congress kii yojana kii thaah lene main asafal rahe
 He took a two-pronged approach to the issue, so that neither Telangana or Seemandhra sent a good message to the public
 jab upie ne antim rup se andhra ke vibhaajan kaa faisla kar liya or simandhra main isaki pratikriya shuru ho gai, uske baad hi tidipi harakat main ai
 It also received some help from others, including their main rival Vai

 But it would not be fair to attribute the rise of Naidu to his opponents completely
 unhone bhi athak, anwarat prayaas kiye hai, khaas kar beete do saal main
 He undertook a marathon tour of rural Andhra from October 2, 2012 to April 27, 2013, targeting his main rival Jagan and presenting TDP as the only option for voters
 is puure daure main media-sajag naidu ne antiaar se mili sikh par amal karte hue saamaanya peshewaron kii vibhinn bhoomikaaon main khud ko prastut kiya—kabhi kisaan to kabhi mochi, nai, auto rikhshachaalak, dhol bajaane vaale, dukandaar, bunakar vagairah, jinaki tasviren surkhiyaan baniin
 He then took a bus tour
 haal ke hafton main unhone rajya bhar main “praja garjana” reliyaan kin
 In these meetings, he emphasized that “TDP victory is a historical necessity
 ” ab ve vikaas ke raste talashne par khaas jor de rahe hai
 But even if all these things will have any effect, only in Andhra
 telugana unke liye dur kii kaudi he, haalanki naidu ne ghoshit kiya he ki agar tidipi-bijepi gathbandhan satta main aayaa to ve pichde varg ke kisi netaa ko pehla mukhyamantri banaaenge
 Naidu knows that there is no possibility of TDP in Telangana as there has been a perception of it being against the new state
 isiilie samajha ja saktaa he ki kyon unhone telugana main loksabhaa kii 17 siton main se aath or vidhansabha kii 119 siton main se 47 bijepi ko de deen
 On the other hand, in Andhra, he has given only four out of 25 Lok Sabha seats and only 17 out of 175 assembly seats
 iske baad bhi ve ummiden jataate hai
 He said about the promise of the Chief Minister's post in Telangana, "I have left this arrow and it can have big results
" ” or vaaki isane congress or uski sahyogi telugana raashtra samiti (tiares) ko asahaj bana diya he
 The two parties have partnered on most of the 17 Lok Sabha seats, but neither of them is confident about crossing the majority figure in the assembly
 naidu ko andhra main svarnim nattejey milane kii ummid he
 But here too tdp's prospects depend on how strong Modi's wave is
 naidu ne modi ke saath kai sanyukt reliyon kaa prastaav rakhaa tha, lekin bijepi ne yah kahkar unka prastaav thukraa diya ki uski ranneeti modi kii reliyon main pradhanmantri pad ke pratyaashee par hi sara dhyaan banaae rakhane kii he
 Naidu had to be content with his two rallies in Mahbubnagar and Hyderabad on 22 April
 naidu ne votaron se apil kii he ki ve modi kaa aglaa pradhanmantri bananaa sunishchit karen
 But in response to this Modi could not appeal to the people to vote to make Naidu the chief minister as both these rallies were in Telangana
 magar unhone antiaar card khelaa or rajya ke do hisson main bant jane ke baad bhi telegu gaurav banaae rakhane kaa vaada kiya
 If Modi's influence is removed, Naidu has many big problems
 congress se aae logon kii vajah se tidipi ke vafaadaar logon kaa man khatta he
 Many such people have protested against the change of party and changing the elections and giving the seats to the BJP for the last 10 years
 naidu ko antiaar parivaar ko bhi khush karnaa he, jisane ab tak unhen apane sasur ko apdasth karne ke liye maaf nahin kiya he
 However he took his brother-in-law and ntr's actor son N
 baalkrishna ko hindoopur vidhansabha seat se tikat diya he
 At one time, the TDP founder called him his political heir
 lekin unki saali di
 Purandeswari is the bjp's Lok Sabha candidate
 is tarah chunaav abhiyaan ke pramukh ne sunishchit kiya he ki yah parivaar vibhajit rahe
 After this there is danger from Jagan
 naidu ne apni party se ke
 Public interest litigation has been filed against Jagan through Yaran Naidu and Ashok Gajapathi Raju, alleging that Jagan was his father late Yai
 es
 During Rajasekhara Reddy's rule, he was involved in corruption on a large scale
 in yachikaaon ke baad sibiai or pravartan nideshaalay ne jagan ko mani landring or anya aparaadhon ke aarope main giraftaar kar jail main daal diya tha
 But now they are out and their stars are climbing
 ve jamkar prachaar kar rahe hai or apana jalawaa dikhaa rahe hai
 The TDP chief knows that the election defeat for the third time in a row will be disastrous and will not be good for his political career at all
 isliye ve vikaas ke naam par janata se vot maang rahe hai
 They are telling the voters, "the name of Andhra Pradesh will be beneficial for this new state because it holds special recognition for its strength in IT and other areas
" ” naidu kehete hai ki aage ve simandhra ke 13 jilon kii bhugolic sthiti or prakritik sansadhano ke kaaran kaaphi acchhee sambhaavnaaen dekh rahe hai
 But whether his appeal will outweigh the young and strong Jagan's hopeful expectations depends on how much trust he wins
 unhone kuch pragati kii he
 But Jagan completely dismisses his opponent's prospects
 ve jor dete hai, “tidipi duusare sthaan par kaaphi peeche rahegi
 "whatever the opponents may say, but Chandrababu Naidu is gearing up for a tremendous fight on the strength of the TDP activists and his supporters

 Apart from this, free broadband of Rs 1700 will also be provided for their parliamentary constituency accommodation
 purv saansadon ke liye masik pension 20,000 rupee se badhkar 35,000 rupee ho jaaegi
 The mps will get Rs 2,80,000 instead of 1,90,000 (including salary, parliamentary constituency allowance and office staff allowances) including salary and allowances
 bhartiya saansadon kaa vetan punarikshan chah saal pehle hua tha
 However, some mps agree with the argument of critics that mps should not have the right to increase their own salary
 tippaniyan Trinamool Congress MP Prasun Banerjee said, "I am against this increase
" ham yahaan logon kii seva karne ke liye hai, or hamen jo kuch mil rahaa he, vah paryaapt he
 At the same time, CPM leader m Rajesh said, we clearly believe that the salary hike should not be decided by us, but there should be an independent body for it

 Will say aaj ke berthde bvoy ne apni jindagi main is doylog ko sutara-vaakya bana liya lekin thode badlaav ke saath
 Sajid Khankah gives
 sajid khan aaj hi ke din apni lambii jabaan ke saath is duniya main avatarit hue the
 Sajid had the qualities to become an excellent chef since childhood
 logon kaa bheja frai karne ke alaava tivi par sajid apane sho ke dauraan bade-bade stars kii izzat kii jam kar bhajiya talate the
 Old people have said that the camel comes under the mountain
 sabakaa majaak udaate-udaate sajid khan aaj khud hi majaak ban gaye hai
 People do not laugh at their words
 sajid khan ke janmdin par ek najar unkebadbolepanke kuch namoonon par
 
 
 1
 sajid ne kaha tha ki unki film kabhi flop ho hi nahin sakati
 He had also claimed that his film 'himmatwala' would prove to be the biggest film of Ajay Devgan's career
 or hua bhi kuch aisa hi yah film ajay devgan ke kariyar kii 'sabase badi vaali' sabit hui
 Fifty parts of 'singham' will not be able to wash the stains of a Himmatwala from Ajay's career
 2
 Speaking loudly, Sajid said that Akshay Kumar was sacked by two of his films
 housephul 1 or housephul 2 ne is dauraan akshay kii bahut madad kii
 This earnest game of Sajid to Khiladi Kumar went through a lot
 vah din or aaj kaa din he sajid khan kaa jo bura daur shuru hua vah khatm hota hi nahin dikh rahaa
 3
 kehete he insaan ko apni baniyaan main rahanaa chahie lekin pathaani suut pahanane vaale sajid ne is muhaavarey kaa matlab nahin janaa
 That is why once he made a statement about Naseeruddin Shah that Naseer Saheb has worked only in most grade grade films
 bataate hai ki si grad filme banane vaale kanti shah ne sajid kii filmein dekhne ke baad daawa kiya ki ab unki filmon ko clasik filmon main shumaar kiya janaa chahie
 4
 sajid khan ye nahin jaanate the ki aadmi kii jabaan kitni bhi lambii ho is maamle main mahila shakti kaa vah muqabla nahin kar sakati
 Sajid once tweeted that his email has been hacked
 iske baad unke acount se kai hiroinon ko neude photo kii 'nirdosh maang' karti hui mail mili
 Sherlyn, who had done a nude photo shoot for 'playboy', biffed and reprimanded Sajid, in which after six abuses, she wrote, 'I thought about you as soon as you read the mail
 ham kehake nahin lete ham to bas le lete hai
 'sherlyn sent a lot of love in the end with the advice to apply itching medicine next to it
 5
 It is said that if you forget the morning, when you come home in the evening, then you do not say that you have forgotten, what those who say this did not say
 chahunor majaak kaa paatr banane ke baad sajid ne pehali baar ek vaazib baat kii
 Like the Hindi dubbing of foreign advertisements on TV, Sajid said, 'at first i was too fat and too arrogant
 ab main bilkul badal gaya hum
 i will be 43 years old soon
 ab main samajhadaar ho gaya hum' haalanki iske kuch hi dinon baad unhone apni purv garlfriend jaclin ke khilaaf bayaan de diya
 Apparently the Sajid tale continues
 sajid khan ko bhavishya kii shubhakamanaayon ke saath happy berthde! In Fatehpur, UP, a bully beat a minor badly after failing the rape and throwing him into the forest and escaped
 uski harakat par najar padane par logon ne usko pakadakar police ke hawaale kar diya

 hindustan ke lagbhag har hisse main buudhvaar der raat holi jalaai gai, magar bundelkhand ke sagar jile kaa hathkhoh ek aisa gaanv he, jahaan holi kaa zikr aate hi log dar jate hai
 People here do not just burn Holika
 is gaanv main holikaa dahan ko lekar na to koi utsaah dikhataa he or na hi kisi tarah kii umang najar aati he
 In Hathkoha village of Deori block, Holi night stays like normal nights
 is gaanv main holi nahin jalaane ke peeche ek kivdanti he
 News agency IANS quoted Veer Bhan, the sarpanch of the village, as saying that several huts caught fire during Holika Dahan in the village decades ago
 tab gaanv ke logon ne jharkhandan devi kii aradhana kii or aag bujh gai
 Locals believe that this fire was extinguished by the grace of Jharkhandan Devi
 lihaaja holikaa kaa dahan nahin kiya janaa chahie
 This is the reason why Holika Dahan does not happen in Hathkhoh village for many generations
 gaanv ke ek bujurg dhanu sen kii maane to unki umr 85 varsh ho gai he, magar unhone gaanv main kabhi holikaa dahan hote nahin dekha
 They say that the people here fear that Jharkhandan Devi might not get upset by burning Holi
 unka kahana he ki is gaanv main holikaa dahan bhale nahin hi hota he, lekin holi khub kheli jaati he
 According to Balaram Thakur, a priest of the Jharkhandan Mata Temple, there is a discussion among the people of Hathkoh village that the Goddess had given darshan and asked people not to burn Holi, since then this tradition has been going on
 dashakon pehle yahaan holi jalaai gai thi, to kai makaan jal gaye the or logon ne jab jharkhandan devi kii aradhana kii, tab aag buji thi

 However, now neither the chaupalas are left nor the Bundeli Fagua singers and singers are seen

 The dispute between the Chief Secretary and the Kejriwal government in the capital Delhi is yet to end
 is maamle main dilli police kii ore se karrwai lagaataar jari he
 On Thursday, the police sent notice to two other Aam Aadmi Party mlas and asked them to join the inquiry
 is baar police ne aap vidhayak nitin tyaagi or rajesh rishi ko notice bheja he
 Significantly, even before this, two mlas are in jail in this case
 aap vidhayak prakaash jarwal or amanatulla khan ko zamaanat dene se tees hajaari court ne manaa kar diya tha

 devli se vidhayak jarwal ko 20 farvari or vahiin amanatulla ko 21 farvari kii shaam ko hiraasat main liya gaya tha
 Prior to the cabinet meeting on Tuesday, Chief Secretary Anshu Prakash wrote a letter to Arvind Kejriwal
 unhone kejariwal se kaha tha, 'main apane sahakarmiyon ke saath baithak main to aa rahe hum, par marpet se bachaa lenaa
 'it was written on behalf of the Secretary in Chitti,' i hope the CM will ensure that there is no physical attack on the officers in this meeting
 yah bhi ummid kii ja rahi he ki is baithak main avyavashtha nahin hogi or adhikariyon kii garima kaa sammaan kiya jayega
 On the other hand, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leaders have approached the Tis Hazari Court in Delhi, alleging

 a meeting was chaired by Finance Minister Arun Gelati on the bill punishing or punishing celebrities and brand ambassadors making false or misleading claims regarding a product
 is mantri samooh kii baithak (gom) main kanoon mantri ravishankar prasad, ram vilaas paswan or jepi nadda bhi shaamil hue
 No decision could be taken in this meeting held on Tuesday
 mantri samooh kii agali baithak main duusare deshon main vigyaapan karne vaale celibrities ko lekar niyam or kanoonon or sajaa ke praavdhaanon par bhi gaur karne ke baad hi koi faisla hoga
 In fact, the Parliamentary Standing Committee to review the provisions of the Consumer Protection Amendment Bill recommended punishment and fine for celebrities and brand ambassadors making misleading and false claims about a product
 samiti kii sifarish ke mutabik agar kisi utpaada kaa vigyaapan pehali baar galat yaa gumraah karne vaala paaya jaataa he to brands ambesder yaa celibrity ko 10 lakh kaa jurmaana yaa 2 saal tak kii kaid yaa donon kaa praavdhaan he
 The second time the same mistake can be punishable by Rs 50 lakh and a punishment of up to 5 years
 haalanki cameti ne gumraah karne vaale yaa galat vigyapanon ko saaf saaf taur par paribhaashit karne kii bhi sifarish sansadeey samiti se kii thi
 The Parliamentary Committee had made this recommendation
 The Parliamentary Committee had also made some recommendations regarding the adulteration of food items
 jo is prakaar hai agar koi vyapaaree pehali baar milawat kaa doshi paaya jaataa he to 2 saal kii kaid or 10 lakh rupye ke jurmaane ke saath-saath uskaa license bhi 2 saal tak ke liye nirast karne or agar duusari baar doshi paae jane par jurmaana 50 lakh or 5 saal kaid ke saath-saath license sthai taur par khatm kar die jane kii sifarish bhi sansadeey samiti ne kii thi
 Way of the bill not easy The committee had also recommended the government to reconsider the provision of the bill in which the consumer was proposed to pay up to Rs 50,000 for making a wrong complaint
 daramil upabhokta sangrakshan sanshodhan vidheyak ko pichley saal 10 agast ko loksabhaa main pesh kiya gaya tha jise kai saansadon kii aapatti ke baad sarkaar ne bill ko sansad kii sthai samiti ke paas bhej diya gaya tha
 One thing is clear, if this bill is passed by Parliament, then this bill will be included in the big achievement of the Modi government, which will directly benefit the consumers

 The film 'ek Villain' is a romantic thriller in which one has a passion for love and revenge, and one has a passion to brutally kill women who speak loudly to him, that is, psycho killer

 Can any Brahmachari also rape? Can a Brahmachari ever take pornographic photos? And can any celibate blackmail someone? Obviously, the answer to all these questions is in 'no'
 lekin bhopal police ne ek aise brahmacharee ko giraftaar kiya he, jin par kuch aise hi iljaam hai
 This Brahmachari is also no ordinary human, but heir to the wealth of Arabs and owns hundreds of school-colleges
 maharishi mahesh yogi uniwarsities ke chancelar girish chandra verma kaa nayaa sach chaunkaane vaala he
 The movements of a brahmachari roaming in a beard-mustache and white dress make up the color
 kya aap yakeen karenge ki koi brahmacharee apane brahmacharya dharm se is kadar dur ho jaae ki wo ladakiyon kaa balaatkaar karne lage, unki ashleel tasviren utaare or phir unheen tasveeron ke jariye unhen blackmel kare? lekin girish chandra verma par jo iljaam lage hai, wo aise hi hai
 Girish Chandra Verma, identified as the chairman and educationist of many schools, has been accused of raping himself by a teacher working under him, which anyone can hear
 kiya videshi condom kaa istemaal or banaai filmbhopal kii rahanevaali is teacher kii maane to verma naa sirf unke saath saalon-saal balaatkaar kiya, balki apane hi skool main kaam karanevaali duusari chaatraon or ladi teachers ko bhi apane saamne pesh karne ke liye dabaav banaate rahe
 
 
 According to the complaint given to the police, this teacher was raped by Girish Chandra Verma for a full 16 years and during this time he used foreign condoms every time and if fond of photography, Verma used his skill in doing porn photography
 Stayed
 usne balaatkaar ke dauraan hi is teacher kii ashleel tasviren utaarin or phir baad main inhen tasveeron kii badaulat wo is teacher or apane pie rahe uske pati ko blackmel karata rahaa
 In its complaint for 16 years, the rape teacher has said that Girish Chandra Verma was trying to torture her since 1996, but after two years i
e
 1998, she raped her for the first time and then in 2013 i
e
 16 years raped her Kept doing is dauraan unhone uske pati se uske bank account or i-mail kii idi or password bhi hasil kar liye or tranjaction karte rahe
 Later she came to know that with this ID and password she mailed several emails from her husband's account to her e-mail ID, so that she could protect herself and blackmail them if needed
 duusari chaatraon or teacheron ko apane saamne pesh karne kaa dabaav banayaor isi blakemeling kii badaulat 1 janvari 2013 ko verma ne is teacher ko apni audi car se uske ghar se agava kar ek baar phir uske saath balaatkaar kiya
 But she may have endured all these things quietly, but when Verma started pressuring her to present other girls and teachers in front of her, she decided to go before the police
 maharishi shikshan santhaan kii ek teacher ne girish chandra verma par jo iljaam lagaae hai, wo hairaan karne vaale hai
 The teacher has said that Verma started her rape in 1998 when she lived in Noida with her husband
 takreeban do saal pehle verma ne use skulon kii sanchaalak sosayadi kaa member bana diya tha or iske baad ek roj verma ne use noida main hi apane ghar bula kar uske saath jyaadati kii
 During this time, Verma got her husband to sign several blank papers and started threatening to kill and kill her when she told anyone about rape
 iske baad to balaatkaar ke jis silsile kii shuruyaat hui, wo saalon-saal chalati rahi
 In 2001, she moved from Noida to Bhopal with her husband, but here too Girish Chandra Verma did not leave her pursuit
 kabhi wo khud unke ghar aa kar uske saath jyaadati karata, to kabhi use apane paas bulavaa letaa
 But in the meantime, Girish Chandra Verma once took down pornographic images of him and said that if he made a mistake of opening his mouth in front of someone in connection with this rape incident, then he would ruin his life by putting all these pictures on the internet
 
 ab tak chunki ye teacher girish chandra verma kii jaal main buree tarah funs chuki thi, uske saamne chup-chaap verma kii baaten maanane ke sivaay koi chaara nahin tha, lekin iske baad verma ne uske saamne ek aisi maang rakhi, jise sun kar uske hosh ud gaye or bas isi din usne verma ke changul se chhootane kaa faisla kar liya
 Girishchandra Varma's wealth of wealth 
 
 ki paimaaish mushkil ho
 
 
 Cars so much
 
 To count
 
 
 or naukar-chaakar itane
 
 ki pahchaan naammumkin ho
 
 
 Chancellor Girishchandra Varma of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi University, who is going to jail in the rape charges, is just like this
 -148 skool- do uniwarsity- hazaron acre kii zamin- anginat beshkeemtee gaadiyaan- darjanon mahal or ashram- 60 hazaar karod kii daulataye jhalak he us shaks ke daulat kii jo ab balaatkaar ke iljaam main jail main band he
 The Chancellor of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi University, Girishchandra Verma inherited billions of wealth, but Varma expanded the scope of this wealth even further
 aaj haalat ye he ki itane skool collejon ke alaava is santhaan ke paas noida jaise khaas ilaake main takreeban 12 sau acre kii jameen he
 Whereas in many places abroad, other movable and immovable property of crores
 bhopal main verma khud jis mahal main rahete hai, uski chakachaundh dekhte hi banati he
 There are more than 40 servants engaged in his service round the clock and Varma's fleet of trains is so large that even the people close to him do not have a proper fathom
 is bede main marcides, bmdablyoo or audi samet anigat hai and kaaren shaamil hai
 Girish Chandra's successor Mahesh Yogi's property worth about 60 thousand crores, Girish Chandra's journey started from Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh
 lekin dekhte hi dekhte unhone mahesh yogi ke is samrajya ko verma ne itnaa bada kar diya ki dekhanevaale dekhte rahe
 When Mahesh Yogi died in 2008, Verma became the owner of all schools, colleges, universities and educational institutions of Yogi in one stroke and he inherited this legacy well
 aaj haalat ye he ki verma hindustan ke 16 rajyon main maujuud 148 skulon kaa sanchaalan khud karte hai or kai ashramon ke maalik hai
 But now the same Girishchandra Verma has been booked under IPC Section 376 ie rape and 506 ie threatening to kill and is currently in jail
 exiaar darj karne main deree kyon hui?kya balaatkaar jaise sangeen maamle main bhi kisi shaks ke rasookh or jalwe ke aage kanoon kamjor pad jaataa he? ye sawaal isliye
 
 kyonki maharishi mahesh yogi shikshan santhaan ke mukhiya girish chandra verma ke khilaaf exiaar darj karne main bhopal police ko puure nau maheene lag gaye
 Why was it delayed? Nobody currently answers this
 apane hi skool main kaam karanevaali ek teacher ke saath solah saalon tak balaatkaar karne ke iljaam main bhopal police ne aakhirkaar girish chandra verma ko giraftaar kar jail to bhej diya, lekin ye sawaal ab bhi apni jagah par qaayam he ki aakhir ye karrwai karne main use nau maheene se bhi zyaada kyon lag gaye?or ye sawaal isliye kyonki jis bhopal police ne verma ko ab jaakar giraftaar kiya, us bhopal police ko peedit mahila ne pichley saal ke march maheene main bhi apni shikaayat likhit taur par di thi
 But since then, the police has been sitting on the horoscope on this complaint and now the police have no firm answer to this delay
 police kii di gai shikaayat kii maane to girish chandra verma par ilzaam lagaanevaale pati-patni saalon se unke yahaan kaam kar rahe the, lekin ek roj achaanak unhen istemaal karne ke baad verma ne unhen baahar kaa rasta dikhaa diya
 However, despite all this and despite being arrested for sexual exploitation and going to jail, the statement issued by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi Institute in favor of Girish Chandra Verma has not only described him as innocent but also It has been said that these allegations of rape are nothing but the conspiracy of his enemies

 He said that capital investment should come from other countries of the world in Uttar Pradesh but that is not happening

 Today the ownership of urban land is changing rapidly
 is badlaav ke bainks ham dekh rahe hai ki aise bade shaharon kii sankhya bhi badhati ja rahi he, jo nae kism kii shahari raajnneeti ke vaahak ban rahe hai
 Of the changes that are taking place, most of the small and public land is going to corporate and privately owned account
 is prakriya ko samajhane ke liye zyada aasaan shabdon main ham yah kah sakate hai ki yahaan imaaraten kharidi ja rahi hai, lekin main kahana chaahuungi ki isaki tah main zyada buniyadi baat yah he ki shahari jameen kharidi ja rahi he
 The level at which the acquisition is taking place is causing a planned change in the pattern of land ownership in the cities
 iskaa asar samanta, loktantr or adhikaron par pad rahaa he
 So far, whatever was small or public, it is turning into huge and private and often with the support of local government
 kahin-kahin to 'site assembly' kaa behad ajeebogareeb vikaas is rup main hota he, jab koi ek vyakti ek yaa do shahari blokon ko hi kharid letaa he or suraksha badhaane ke naam par sadakon, galiyon ko khatm karne kii uski maang ke aage shahari prashasan bhi ghutane tech detaa he
 The trend is to move from those small structures in urban geography to projects that swallow the streets, streets and squares of the city
 shahari spes kaa nijeekaran hota he or shaharikaran kii prakriya hi ulat jaati he
 The policies of privatization and regulation introduced in the nineties have given further impetus to this urban grandeur and these policies continue to this day
 kul milakar iskaa nateeja yah hua he ki saarvajanik bhawanon kii sankhya ghati he or nijee swaamitv main ijapha hua he
 This has led to a decrease in the nature and level of places previously accessible to ordinary people
 pehle jahaan kahin sarkari imaarat thi, aaj sambhav he ki vahaan korporate mukhyalay, lagjri apartment yaa mal khadaa ho
 The real issue is not of foreign ownership, but of the change in the nature of ownership - the conversion of affordable or small to large and expensive, the conversion of affordable public property into expensive private property
 haal hi main kathith 'super prime' real estate market kii shuruyaat hui he
 It is an artificially constructed or developed market where property is affixed to a minimum price — in cities such as New York, London, and Hong Kong — up to 80 million, 20 million, or outright US $ 100 million
 jahaan tak meri samaj he, ye parisampattiyaan vastav main itani mahangi hoti nahin
 To seal the minimum price is to set a scale and secure them
 inke chaaron ore ek kalpit diwaar khadi kar dena he
 The fact is that all these methods are a means of making huge profits
 iske alaava yah simaaon ke paar jaakar ek aisa bhugol nirmit karne kii kavayad he, jisamen duniya ke ahm shaharon ke kuch vishisht spes aapas main jud jate hai
 Where a new geography of wealth and influence is strengthened by replacing the old historical division of north and south, east and west
 aap neuyork main iskaa udhaaharan dekh sakate hai, jahaan kazakhstan or china ke graahak adhigrahan kii nai lahar par savaar hai

 Whether in the southern hemisphere of the world or northern, large cities have emerged as strategic frontiers of global corporate capital today
 mejabaan sarkaron par nijeekaran or nai rajkoshiya or maudrik nitiyon ko thope jane kaa sidhaa sambandh darasal puraane sainya 'kilon' kaa ek nayaa aadhunik sanskaran taiyaar karne or vah karne ke liye puunji kaa aujaar muhaiyaa karaane se he
 These frontier spaces emerging in the midst of important big cities are arising in the backdrop of the divisions spreading within and between these cities themselves
 in vibhaajanon or simaaon kii sabase saaf abhivyakti gated communities (charadivari se ghiri colony) main hoti he
 The global corporate capital that 'our' cities use is actually part of these concrete divisions
 saamanyat: logon ko yah kehete hue suna jaataa he ki aaj se 30 saal pehle ham kahin zyada simaaon main bandhi duniya main rahete the
 It is not so now
 yah baat tabhi sach ho sakati he, jab ham simaaon ko rashtron ke bich kii paaramparik simaaon ke rup main dekhte hon or seemaa paar pravaah ke daayre main sirf puunji, soochna or kuch aabaadi samoohon ko rakhte hon
 Even if we remove the barriers present in some areas of our economy and society, we see that instead of moving towards a borderless world, we are creating new boundaries
 in nai simaaon main pravesh asambhav he
 In this way a global city with its entire complexities actually takes the shape of a frontier region, which has deep political implications because this is the space where even powerless people can make history, create their politics and culture

 BJP leader Sudhir Mungantiwar even claimed that the BJP has also sent a proposal to the Shiv Sena
 lekin prastaav kya he or formula kya hoga, ye pattey kholane se unhone inkaar kar diya
 Mungantiwar on Tuesday hinted at possible success in the ongoing standoff with the Shiv Sena over the formation of the government and said that "good news" could come at any moment
 unhone patrakaron se kaha, ‘‘kisi bhi samay sarkaar gathan ko lekar acchhee khabar aa sakati he
 State BJP president Chandrakant Patil, who attended the meeting, said that they are now waiting for a proposal from the Shiv Sena
 unhone kaha, ‘‘hamane maharashtra main party ke vidhayak dal ke netaa ke rup main fadanvis ko puraa samarthan diya he
 BJP leader Girish Mahajan said on Tuesday that his party was not ready to hold talks with its ally Shiv Sena to share the chief minister's post and that Devendra Fadnavis would become the next chief minister

 On the Shiv Sena's demand for 'written assurance', the BJP leader said, "we are indo-pakistan or we cannot negotiate
 donon dalon ke netaa milakar satta saajha karne ke formule par baat kar sakate hai
 There is no point in demanding such things in writing
 "bijepi daawa to kar rahi he ki sarkaar mahayuti kii banegi or devendra fadanvis ke netritv main hi banegi lekin kaise, iskaa jawaab dene se batch rahi he
 The question is, will the Shiv Sena accept the Chief Minister's post and at what cost? Meanwhile, the Congress and NCP leaders met the Governor together

 Today is the birthday of the player who won the World Cup under the leadership of Team India in the year 2011
 
 
 
 We are talking about Mahendra Singh Dhoni
 dhoni maane ek aisa khilaadi jiske bare main unke phans kehete hai ki agar vah pathar par hi haath rakh de to vah sona ho jaataa he
 His style of playing was very different when Dhoni, known as Captain Cool, started his international career by joining Team India
 vah bahut zyada aakraamak ballebaaji karte the or chaukon-chhakkon kii barsaat kar dete the
 Dhoni's batting is completely different from the traditional batsmen and he uses the techniques he has devised for the shots written in the cricket book
 srilanka ke khilaaf jab unhone 183 ranon kii pari kheli to aisa laga ki is ballebaaj ke aage duniya kii sarvshereshth gendbaaji bhi bekaar he
 He had beaten a bowler like Chaminda Vaas in this match
 unki kshamta ko dekhte hue saurav ganguli ke baad unhen team india kii captaini saunp di gai or unki aguwai main team ne 2007 kaa tii-20 vishwacap chir pratidwandi pakistan ko haraakar jeet liya
 After this, Dhoni went on to become the biggest star in the cricket world
 haalanki captaini ke baad unki ballebaaji main badlaav aa gaya or vah dhuandhar khilne ke bajaae sanbhalkar match jitau paariyaan khilne lage
 Whatever decision he took as captain would have proved right in the field
 dhoni ek ke baad ek toornament jitate chale gaye
 Then in 2011, the Cricket World Cup came
 team india sachin tendulkar, virendra sahvaag, yuvaraj singh, harbhajan singh, jahir khan, ashish nehra jaise sitaron se saji thi or uske captain the mahendra singh dhoni
 Team India went on to play the final against Sri Lanka after beating Australia in the semi-finals
 pehle ballebaaji karte hue srilanka ne 274 ran kaa bada score khadaa kar diya tha jisamen mahela jayavardhane naabad shatak lagaaya
 Chasing the target, Team India first lost the wicket of Virender Sehwag and then Sachin to Tendulkar
 
 
 
 There was silence all over the stadium
 
 
 aisa laga 28 saalon baad vishwacap jeetne kaa sapana adhuraa rah jayega
 
 
 
 isi bich gautam gambhir or viraat kohli maidan main the
 
 
 Both were facing Sri Lankan bowlers
 
 
 
 Millions of people across the world were glued to television
 
 
 tabhi ek or wicket gir gaya
 
 
 
 viraat kohli out ho gaye
 
 
 
 
 After this, Mahendra Singh Dhoni made a shocking decision, instead of sending Yuvraj, Mahendra Singh Dhoni himself took the bat and landed in the field
 
 
 
 Once it seemed that Dhoni made this wrong decision because Yuvraj Singh was in fullform and had won many matches in the tournament
 lekin dhoni ne faisle ko galat nahin sabit hone diya or 91ranon kii pari kheli
 After this, Team India won the World Cup by hitting a six
 is match main gautam gambhir ne bhi 97 ranon kii pari kheli thi
 After the match, many people had the same question in their mind as to who was Dhoni's decision to land at number four or was he advised by someone
 is baat kaa khulaasa virendra sahvaag ne shanivaar ko team india or srilanka ke antim lig match kii camentry dauraan kiya
 He told that this advice was given by Sachin Tendulkar
 tendulkar unase kaha ki agar left hand ballebaaj ho to uski left hand vaala yaa rhite hand ballebaaj out ho to uski jagah rhite hand vaala ballebaaj jaae
 Sehwag said that i told Tendulkar that you speak it
 
 
 phir maine unako kehane par coach gauri custorn ko yah bataai or phir dhoni bhi yah baat maan gaye
 The result was in front of everyone

 Assembly elections in Karnataka have reached the final stages
 donon partiyon ke sheersh str ke netaaon ne rajya main chunaav prachaar main puri takat jhonk di he
 During the campaign, India Today held special talks with BJP national president Amit Shah and hoped that the party would form the government with a large majority in the state
 shah ke saath khaas baatcheet ke 10 mukhya ansh
 
 
 On going into the last phase of election campaign in Karnataka and the party's prospects, BJP President Amit Shah said that the election has taken shape
 bhartiya janata partiadhe se zyada siton par aage nikal gai he
 We are going to form a government with a good majority
 kya bijepi jedies ke saath aapasi ranneeti banakarchunavalad rahi he, is sawaal parashahne kaha ki aisa isliye dikhataa he kyonki donon partiyaan sarkaar kii satta virdohi lahar kaa phayda uthaane kii koshish kar rahi hai, lekin hamaara kisi ke saath koi samjhauta nahin
 There is no question of going with the support of Owaisi

 Publicly praising one's seniority or one's good quality does not mean that there is an agreement
 saarvajanik jivan kaa matlab yah nahin ki kisi kii acchhee chizon kii tarif hi na kii jaae
 In Old Mysore in the state, where bjp's performance has been poor, on the question of taking support from JDS after counting on May 15, Shah said that BJP is winning at least 15 out of 29 seats in Old Mysore this time
 aatankwaadiyon ke khilaaf ladate rahengekarnataka main hindu-muslim vibhaajan kii koshish or chunaav ko sampradayik rang main dhaalane ke prayaas ke bare main shah ne kaha ki bhatkal or jihadiyon par atake karnaa bijepi kaa daayitv he
 It is our priority to fight the fight against terrorists in public life
 popular front of india (piefai) ke mudde par shah ne jawaab dete hue kaha ki yah baat puri tarah se galat he
 The constitution of India is of federal level, there is no BJP government in the 2 states in which the case of PFI is connected
 karnataka ne bain karne sambandhi koi darkhwaast nahin bheji jabaki kerala ne mahaj aupchaarikta nibhaai
 When the BJP government comes to Karnataka, it will send the request to the center with complete facts and action will be seen immediately
 rajya main jihadiyon ke jariye bijepi ke maare gaye kaaryakartaaon kii suchi main sabase upar shaamil ashok pujari ke jinda hone kii khabar par shah ne kaha ki unhen is sambandh main koi jaankaree nahin he
 24 of our workers were killed
 ho saktaa he ki typing erar ke kaaran ghayal logon kaa naam mritak kii suchi main daal diya gaya ho, lekin iske baavjood ghatana ko kam karke nahin aanka ja saktaa
 The extremists are behind these killings, and the Congress is in agreement with them, the Congress will have to answer all these things in this election
 rajya main congress sarkaar ke satta virdohi lahar ke alaava chunaav or kya ishyu he, ke sawaal par shah ne kaha ki hamane 22 karod pariwaron ko chuaa he, 9 karod logon ko mudra yojana main shaamil kiya he
 There have been attempts to raise the standard of living of poor people
 rajya main ab log sochane lage hai ki koi sarkaar he jo garibon ke bare main sochati he
 Law and order in the state has deteriorated

 The Congress understands that these people are contesting from 3 seats whereas the reality is that these three people are contesting the entire 224 seats

 ) On the one hand, the government is facing allegations that it is taking credit for the surgical strike on the loc without reason, while Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar has said that there is no doubt that 100 percent of the credit for this surgical strike goes to the army but this The government should also be praised for its fearless decision
 isse thodi der pehle ek kaarykram main parrikar ne yah bhi kaha tha ki is oparation kaa shrey pradhanmantri ko janaa chahie
 Talking about his role, he had said that 'I have just done the work of' decision making and planning '
 'tippaniyan Significantly, many opposition leaders including Rahul Gandhi have said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and many of his senior ministers are exaggerating the role of the government in the military proceedings held on 29 September
 haalanki piem modi ne apane mantriyon se is maamle main saavdhaanee baratane or sargical strike ke liye khud kii peeth thapthapaane se bachane ke liye kaha tha
 On Tuesday, Home Minister Rajnath Singh said that the PM has proved that India is not a weak country
 udhar bijepi adhyaksh amit shah kaa bayaan tha ki sena kii himmat kii daad deni hogi lekin piem kii raajnneetik ichhashakti kaa us strike kii safalataa ke peeche bahut bada haath he jo ki '100 percent parfect' sabit hui
 The Congress has claimed that the raids were carried out across the border even when she was in power, but the party did not make this military operation public because the government did not want the differences with Pakistan to escalate
 saath hi sena ko bhi is tarah ke samvedansheel oparation karne ke liye jaruri gopneeyata mil sake
 On the other hand, Pakistan has denied the claim of any kind of surgical strike
 arvind kejariwal samet vipaksh main baithi partiyon ne sarkaar se sargical strike ke saboot pesh karne ke liye kaha he taaki pakistan ke jhooth ko saamne laayaa ja sake
 However, many ministers have described this demand for evidence as unison in Pakistan
 gauratlab he ki rahul gandhi samet vipaksh ke kai netaaon ne kaha he ki pradhanmantri narendra modi or unke kai varisht mantri 29 sitambar ko hui sainya kaarywahi main sarkaar ke role ko badha chadhaakar prastut kar rahe hai
 However, PM Modi asked his ministers to be cautious in this matter and to avoid patting themselves on the back for surgical strikes
 mangalvaar ko grahamantri rajnath singh ne kaha tha ki piem ne sabit kar diya he ki bharat kamazor desh nahin he
 On the other hand, BJP President Amit Shah's statement was that the courage of the army will have to be appreciated but the political will of the PM has a huge hand behind the success of that strike which proved to be '100 percent perfect'
 congress ne daawa kiya he ki jab vah satta main thi tab bhi seemaa paar chaape maare gaye te lekin party ne is sainya kaarywahi ko saarvajanik isliye nahin kiya kyonki tab kii sarkaar nahin chaahati thi ki pakistan ke saath matbhed badhen
 Also, the army can also get the necessary secrecy to carry out such sensitive operations
 udhar pakistan ne kisi bhi tarah kii sargical strike ke hone ke daawey ko nakaara he
 The parties in the opposition, including Arvind Kejriwal, have asked the government to present evidence of surgical strikes so that the lies of Pakistan can be exposed
 haalanki kai mantriyon ne saboot kii is maang ko pakistan ke sur main sur milaane jaisaa bataaya he
 The Congress has claimed that the raids were carried out across the border even when she was in power, but the party did not make this military operation public because the government did not want the differences with Pakistan to escalate

 Just a few months before the assembly elections, the BJP made a move to make its strongman Sushma Swaraj the chief minister

 Instead of ending the fast, the deadlock deepened when the government issued a letter written by a close friend of the yoga teacher, which said that Ramdev would end his fast in the middle
 baatcheet vifal rahane ke baad donon pakshon ke bich vaadon ko todane ke aarope-pratyarope kaa daur chalaa
 Ramdev accused the government of 'betrayal and deceit'
 kendriya mantri kapil sibbal ne samvaadadaataaon ke samaksh ramdev ke kareebi acharya baalkrishna kaa likhaa ek patr jari kiya
 After this, the yoga teacher took a dig at the government and said that she was committing 'betrayal and fraud'
 ramdev ne kaha ki vah ab sirf pradhanmantri kii hi baat par yakeen karenge, jinka vah ab bhi sammaan karte hai
 a few moments before this, Baba Ramdev announced that the government would accept his demands in the evening and said that he would break the fast if written assurance came from the government
 anshan sthal kaa maahaul is ghatnakram ko dekhte hue vijayi utsaah se sarabor hone laga or shanivaar ko hi anshan samaapt hone kii sambhaavnaaen saamne aane lageen
 a few moments later, when the media revealed the script written earlier with the consent of the government to end this satyagraha, suddenly the talk got worse
 is patr par ramdev ke vishwast sahyogi acharya baalkrishna ke hastakshar hai
 As soon as the letter was revealed, everything started to appear in the title of the title
 ramdev samvaadadaataaon dwaara baar-baar kiye gayi is sawaal kaa jawaab nahin de paye ki jab sarkaar ke saath unka likhit samjhauta ho chukaa tha, to unhone anshan kaa ‘naatak’ kyon kiya or samjhaute kii baat ko janata se or apane samarthakon se kyon chhipaakar rakhaa
 In his press conference, Sibal gave a 'soft-warm' message to Baba and said that the government has fulfilled all its commitments
 ramdev ko galatfahami thi ki videshon main jamaa kaledhan ko rashtriya sampatti ghoshit karne ke bare main faisla sarkaar dwaara gathit samiti karegi, jabaki is samiti ko is bare main kanoon banane kaa taur-tarika tay karnaa tha
 Sibal said that the government has accepted this
 is mudde par koi adhyadesh jari karne kii sambhaavna se inkaar karte hue mantri ne vastut: chetavanee dete hue kaha ki sarkaar kii narmi ko koi kamajori nahin samajhe
 Sibal said that if we can listen, we can also be tough
 unhone kaha ki baatcheet ko kamajori nahin samajha janaa chaiye
 After the issue of Sibal's release letter came to light, Baba Ramdev was badly surrounded by the questions of the reporters and did not make him answer about the script he had already written that when everything was already decided, he made people all over the country Why was he called for fast and satyagraha? ramdev ke kehane kaa aashay tha ki sarkaar ne agle do din ke bheetar unki sabhi maangen puraa karne kaa likhit vaada karne kii baat kahi thi or yah patr anshan samaapt karne kaa hamaari ore se aashwaasan tha
 However, Ramdev, who is seated at the top of morality, appeared to be shining under the pressure of these questions and he suddenly hardened his tone, saying that he was not afraid to go to jail and he started talking to his supporters
 gave
 sarkaar kii mudra se ramdev sakate main aa gayi or unhone apni teenon maangen puri hone tak satyagrah jari rakhane kaa phir elaan kiya
 Three demands ie declaring black money as national property, enacting a law to seize black money and severe punishment and keep an eye on those who go to the shelters of tax evasion
 kapil sibbal ke patr saarvajanik kar dene se sakapakaaye ramdev ne kaha, ‘‘kapil sibbal jhuthe hai
 i will never talk to him in life
 ’’ haalanki, unhone kaha ki pradhanmantri or unke nirnyon par unhen ab bhi vishwaas he
 In response to questions, Ramdev clarified that the letter was given after the ministers' insistence
 unke anusaar, mantri is patr ke jariye pradhanmantri ko yah bataanaa chaahate the ki ramdev kaa anshan anischitkaaleen nahin chalegaa or na hi is andolan kaa makasad sarkaar ko asthir karnaa he
 Baba Ramdev said that the government was feeling disheartened by the arrival of four ministers from the airport to receive them and that is why this letter was written
 sibbal ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha ki unhone ramdev se phone par baatcheet kar unhen aashwaasan diya tha ki sarkaar ek kanoon banane or samiti gathit karne ke liye patibaddh he or is disha main prayaas aage bad rahe hai
 However, the minister made it clear that there is no possibility of issuing ordinances in this regard
 sibbal ne kaha ki sarkaar ramdev ko samiti gathit hone ke aashwaasan sambandhi patr bhejegi
 Defending Ramdev's decision to open the kalyan, government sources said that the yoga guru was constantly changing his stance
 sutron ne kaha ki ramdev ne aparaahn chaar baje tak anshan khatm karne kaa vaada kiya tha or jab aisa nahin hua to unhen yah saaf taur par bataanaa padaa ki sarkaar patr ko jari karne ja rahi he
 Earlier, sitting on a fast against corruption, Baba Ramdev took an aggressive stance and said that efforts were being made to intimidate him and warned that if he was attacked, he would not sit silent
 dopaher main do ghante ke viraam ke baad manch par phir lautne par unhone sambhavat: congress ke aaropon kaa jawaab dete hue kaha, ‘‘kuch log gaiyr-jimmedaarana tippaniyan kar rahe hai ki main asthirataa paidaa karnaa chahta hum
 i have not divided caste or region based on Hindus and Muslims
 ’’baba ramdev ne kaha, ‘‘sachaai kii is ladaai main main pehla prahaar nahin karuunga, lekin agar mujh par hamalaa hua to chup bhi nahin baithunga
 On the Congress's allegation of RSA and BJP being operated by remote control, Ramdev said, "I am not an agent of BJP or RSS
" main kisaanon or shramikon kaa agent hum
 We are not against any party or person
 ’’subah anshan par baithne par unhone aarope lagaaya tha ki vah apana andolan nahin chalaa paaen iske liye ‘shadyantr’ ho rahe hai, lekin is arope ke bare main unhone adhik kuch kehane se inkaar kar diya
 The yoga guru said that he neither wants any political post nor wants to contest elections
 unhone kaha, ‘‘agar mujhe pradhanmantri yaa raashtrapati banane kii peshkash kii jaati he to bhi main nahin banuunga
 Describing Prime Minister Manmohan Singh as an "honest man", he said that if the government takes up his issues with due diligence and accepts their demand, then he will give credit to the government only
 unhone kaha ki ve yahaan koi naukari yaa aarakshan paane ke liye nahin aae hai
 Baba Ramdev said, "I have not come to beg
 main us baat kii maang kar rahaa hum jo desh ke liye sahi he
 Asked whether it was a mistake to accept Anna Hazare to set up a joint committee to draft the Lokpal Bill, Ramdev said he would not comment on the Gandhian activist
 unhone kaha ki hajaare unke saath hai
