 The color shift on the Redmi Y3 looks great, especially when it is illuminated with different angles
 lekin jin yuzars ko anderstated dizine pasand he, unke liye prime blike verient he
 Even though its look is tempting, the Redmi Y3 easily gets fingerprints
 is par dust or ghabbe bhi aasaani se chipakate hai
 Now it will be interesting to see how the device handles scratches

 Like the Redmi 7, the Redmi Y3 has three slots

 He bluntly told a faction protesting for electricity in his constituency that he made a difference whether those people voted for him or not

 desh kii rajdhani dilli kii 7 loksabhaa siten desh ke siyaasi mizaaj kii jhalak de jaati hai
 In the last 22 years, the power of Hindustan has been ruled by the same party which has won the trust of the people of Delhi in the Lok Sabha elections
 is avadhi main dilli kii janata ne kabhi bhartiya janata party to kabhi congress ko satta kii jimmedaari saunpi he
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, BJP won all the seven Lok Sabha seats of Delhi and Modi government was formed at the center, then in 2009 the people of Delhi expressed their confidence in the Congress and gave seven seats to the party's bag
 itihaas ke aaine main dilli kaa chunaav1998 se dilli kaa saath usee party ko mila he jisane centre main apni sarkaar banaai he
 In 1998, BJP got 6 out of 7 seats in Delhi
 tab atal bihari vaajapeyi ke netritv main bijepi ne kai dalon ke sahyog se endie banaai or centre main gathbandhan kii sarkaar banaai
 This coalition government lasted only 13 months and in 1999, Lok Sabha elections were held once again
 1999 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ne dilli kii sabhi saaton siton par fatah hasil kii
 This time too, although the party did not get an absolute majority at the center, the BJP formed a coalition government at the center
 atal bihari vaajapeyi teesri baar desh ke pradhanmantri bane
 Earlier in 1996, Vajpayee also became the Prime Minister of the country for 13 days
 tab bhi bijepi ne dilli kii saat main se 6 loksabhaa siten jiti thim
 Congress got power in the 2004 Lok Sabha election, the circle of power turned, the lotus sign disillusioned the people of Delhi and BJP got only 1 seat here
 congress ne dilli main 6 siten hasil kii
 Senior Congress leader Dr
 Manmohan Singh became the Prime Minister of the country
 2009 main bhi dilli main voting kaa yahi pattern rahaa
 This time the Congress strengthened its hold in Delhi and won all the seven seats
 dow manmohan singh duusari baar desh ke pradhanmantri bane
 By giving zero seats to the BJP and keeping away from the power of the Center, the Delhiites have once again proved that their mood, the country also follows the same path
 2014 ke baad badali dilli kii raajnneetiloksabhaa chunaav kii baat karen to dilli ke matadaataaon ne apana purana pattern barkaraar rakhaa
 Like the country in 2014, there was a Modi wave in Delhi
 dilli kii sabhi saaton siten congress ke kabje se chali gayi or bijepi ke khate main ain
 Narendra Modi became the Prime Minister of the country
 haalanki, saal 2013 main hi dilli kii raajnneeti main aam aadmi party dastak de chuki thi, lekin 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main AAP koi bhi chhap chhodane main naakaam rahi
 It is also interesting to note here that the pattern of assembly elections in Delhi is different from the Lok Sabha voting
 dilli main 1998 se lekar 2013 tak lagaataar congress satta main rahi
 Despite this, the party had to face defeat in the 1998 and 99 Lok Sabha elections in Delhi
 2019 ke loksabhaa main dilli main congress, bijepi or aam aadmi party teenon hi partiyaan puri takat ke saath chunaav lard rahi hai

 Both sides expressed the hope that the Border Defense Cooperation Agreement (BDCA) which is being discussed at the present time will come in handy to deal with such incidents
 antni ne kaha, ‘bidisie par vastav main pragati hui he tathaa ummid he ki ise uchit samay main antim rup pradaan kar diya jayega
 The purpose of the BDCA is to create an arrangement that will provide dialogue for dialogue so that both sides can improve border management

 Now you removed from your manifesto? This is a fraud with the people of Delhi
 iskaa matlab aap apane menifesto main jhooth bolte ho
 Then how can the public believe your remaining promises? In another tweet, Arvind Kejriwal had described bjp's Manifesto as a book of jumals
 unhone (arvind Kejriwal) kaha tha ki bijepi ne abhi tak yah nahin bataaya he ki 2014 main jo jumale menifesto ke rup main janata ke saamne rakhe gaye the

 unhone kaha tha ki jab vah vot maangane ke liye aaen to unhen apane gharon se baahar nikaal dijie kyonki ab vah kah rahe hai ki rashtriya rajdhani ko purna rajya kaa darja nahin diya ja saktaa

 ’’‘south asia centre da atlantic council of united stats’ ke nideshak or pakistani vidwaan shuja navaj ne kaha ‘‘kashmir samasya ke samaadhaan se khatra nahin mitane ja rahaa kyonki in samoohon kaa uddeshy pakistan ke bheetar satta hathiyanna tathaa uskaa niyantran hasil karnaa he
 At the hearing, Nawaz and Telis were responding to concerns by US lawmakers that if the Kashmir problem is resolved, will lashkar-e-taiba abandon terrorism
 telis ne kaha ‘‘mujhe yah baat hameshaa salti he ki kashmir ghati main hatyaein karne vaale or utpaat machaane vaale aaj kashmiri nahin hai
 Those who were actually denied political rights are not involved in the murders and the uprising
 ’’ unhone kaha ‘‘ghati main katleam or utpaat aise logon dwaara machaaya ja rahaa he jinka kashmir se koi sambandh nahin he
 The thing in my mind is that this is a group operating in 21 countries, its ideology is completely anti-western, it is against generosity and secularism and the values we adopt
 yah samooh (lashkar) kashmir mudde ke samaadhaan se santusht nahin hone ja rahaa
 Lisa Curtis of the Heritage Foundation referred to the formula suggested by former Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf for resolution of the Kashmir dispute about which he made a statement in 2006
 unhone kaha ki musharraf ne disambar 2006 main bahut mahatvapurn bayaan diya tha ki yadi chaar chijen ho jaati hai to pakistan kashmir par apana daawa chhodana chahega

 When Narendra Modi was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, he used to show a unique understanding of what kind of training the people of the state need
 unhone 'gunotsav' yani gunon kaa utsav shuru kiya tha, jo is baat par dhyaan dene vaali abhinav pahal thi ki bachche aakhir kitna or kya sikh rahe hai
 This was also the time when due to the Right to Education (RTE), the attention of the people was going on issues like classrooms and playgrounds in schools
 isse kam bajet ke nijee skulon kaa vajood khatre main pad gaya tha
 The controversial rule of 25 per cent reservation was being enforced (the outline of which was not set to be implemented)
 'gunotsav' ke dauraan mukhyamantri or unke tamaam mantri, iees or anya varisht adhikari har saal bagaiyr elaan kiye teen dinon tak rajya ke ek-chauthai skulon kaa daura karte, unke halaat kaa muyna karte or yah bhi dekhte ki bacchon ko jo padhaayaa ja rahaa he, uskaa kya nateeja niklaa
 When Modi noticed that the seventh grade students in a village of Kutch were not able to read properly, he also gave a slight rebuke to his parents that he himself was not interested in the education of the children and asked the teachers Set high expectations
 takreeban 10 rajyon ne talim ke nateezon par dhyaan dene ke liye 'gunotsav' kaarykram kii pramukh baton ko apanaaya tha
 This is when there was no talk of Modi becoming Prime Minister
 isi tarah bacchon main padhgaye kii aadat daalane ke liye 'vaanche gujarat' naamak kaarykram shuru kiya gaya tha, jabaki pratispardhaatmak khelon main pratibhaaon ko badhaava dene ke liye khel mahotsav kii shuruyaat kii gai thi
 Some of these initiatives were undoubtedly not fundamental, but due to the quality of implementation and focus on the results, they looked different from the general schemes of the state
 ucch shiksha vibhaag ne collejon main tej raftaar internet pahunchane or anusandhan ke nateezon kii behatari par dhyaan diya tha
 Few leaders have the foresight to see what can be achieved through education
 aise main modi kii shuru kii gai nitiyaan bilkul alag najar aati thim
 Is it any wonder then that there were too many expectations when he became Prime Minister? a year ago i wrote in this magazine that the government should make an HRD minister who understands the importance of the results of the training
 jo dusron ke saath milakar badlaav kaa nakshaa bana sake
 Also, pay attention to the quality of education and innovations
 aaj jab main peeche mudakar dekhtaa hum to paata hum ki ye kaam nahin kiye gaye hai
 At least not yet been done
 jo netaa yojanaon par bahut teji se amal karwaane kii apni dhun ke liye janaa jaataa ho, uske shashan main shiksha ke kshetra main aage badaae kii raftaar durbhaagya se bahut dhimi he
 Some people may say that it is better to be careful in the case of training
 purv shiksha mantri kapil sibbal ne upie-2 ke 100 dinon ke bheetar shiksha kaa adhikaar kanoon paarit karvaa diya tha or sibiesai kii 10veen board kii pariksha ko aichhik bana diya tha
 Both decisions were not only controversial, but are now considered useless and counterproductive
 so ho saktaa he ki dhire chalanaa hi sahi ho
 Inactivity in the first year of Modi government in education sector cannot be evaluated more generously than inactivity
 duusari safai yah he ki aarthik muddon par apane shuruaati focus ke baad jab modi shiksha par dhyaan denge, tab sarkaar ko kuch thos kadam uthaate dekha jayega
 So what has the government done in terms of education? Come, let us examine some of the successes of the government as well as some of the biggest lapses
 shiksha par kharch main rajyon kaa hissashiksha kii chunautiyon kaa muqabla karnaa ek pechida masalaa he or iskaa hameshaa do-took jawaab nahin miltaa
 The government took a good step, which is not well understood
 shiksha par kharch kaa zyada bada vittiya hissaa rajyon ko saunp diya gaya he
 This is a good step because in the case of training, it is the responsibility of the states to implement the major schemes of the government
 aksar yah ashanka jataai jaati he ki rajnatik ichhashakti or amal kii kshamta, donon ke kamjor hone kii vajah se rajyon ko centre ke dabaav kii jarurat hoti he
 But the permanent solution is to make the states strong and hold them responsible for the implementation of the schemes
 rajya kii kshamtaayen viksit karne kaa yah ekmaatr tarika bhi he
 In the case of training, the biggest initiative that the government refers to today is the new education policy
 lagata he jamini str par rajnatik jaagrukta paidaa karne kii or logon ko zyada bade paimaane par shaamil karne kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 But in a country with such a large young population, where training can really make or break the future of the country, i would like to listen to Modi's proverb 18 months ago: "the country needs actions, not laws
" '' nai shiksha niti kaa swaagat tabhi kiya jayega, jab uske saath use lagu karne ke liye kadam bhi uthaae jaaenge
 Without him the policy alone will not do anything
 kuch chote-chote kadamaladakiyon ke liye aarthik protsaahan, svachh vidhyalay abhiyaan, beti bachaao beti padhaao, skool moolyankan kaa dhaancha, shaala darpan, ishan vikaas or vidwaanon ke saath vidhyaarthiyon kaa samvaad aadi sarkaar kii kuch nai pahal hai
 Their aim is to improve girls' education, promote mathematics, science and innovation among students, make schools accountable and give parents an opportunity to take stock of the child's training through mobile means
 jaahir he ki doorgaami asar daalane vaale bade buniyadi kadam uthaane kii bajaae is sarkaar ne pratikwaad ko tarjeeh di he
 Symbolism is not bad in itself, but if concrete steps are not taken with it, it remains largely ineffective
 shikshak diwas par pradhanmantri kaa skulon or shikshakon se judsa ek acha kadam tha
 It should be noted that some of these were initiatives of the previous government, which have only been continued
 inamen se kaiyon kaa vaisaa asar nahin hua tha, jaisi ummid kii gai thi (misaal ke liye: purvottar ke rajyon main skulon ko behatar tareeke se jodgaye or viksit karne ke liye ishan vikaas pahal)
 The new government also decided to discontinue central government assistance to 6,000 model schools originally announced during UPA-1
 main ise acha kadam maanata hum kyonki is baat kaa koi saboot nahin he ki vikaskhand mukhyalay par vibhedak fees ke saath privet-public partnership kaa model acchhee tarah kaam kar paata
 Unreasonable controversies: The controversy over replacing Sanskrit with German language in central schools, issues involving the heads of Indian Institutes of Technology (iits) and the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) and allegations of saffronisation of textbooks — all of this government's image Had a bad effect on bhale hi media ne inhen kuch zyada hi badha-chadhaakar pesh kiya ho
 The government's list of omissions is much bigger than misfortune
 shiksha ke kshetra main kadam badhaane ke liye ek saaf nakshe kii jarurat he, magar vah nahin banaaya gaya
 Secondly, it seems that the Education Department has not been able to understand that the 'make in India' initiative has as much to do with other things as it is with education and skill development
 ye svarnim maukey ho sakate the, jinhen sambhavat: gavaan diya gaya
 Strengthening Institutions: The post of Director of NCERT has been lying vacant for several months, but the process of filling it has not started
 saikadon- hajaaron naujavaanon kaa bhavishya tay karne vaali kendriya madhyamik shiksha board (sibiesai) sareekhee sansthaaen gunvattta or kshamta ke gambhir sankat se jujh rahi hai
 a new education policy is needed to resolve these issues and change the situation
 har baar jitne shikshak adhyaaapak paatrata pariksha dete hai, unamem se keval 1-10 fisadi hi isamen paas ho pate hai
 This clearly shows the serious gap between our education system and this exam
 in muddon ko academik or prashasnic upayon se hal kiya ja saktaa he
 This work needs to be done very fast
 sarkaar kaa ek sabase bada yogadan yah ho saktaa he ki vah bharat kii vishaltam shaikshik chunautiyon kaa jawaab khojane ke liye (iity, iiem, ekwas or ensiiarti isi kaam ke liye banaai gai hai) kendriya adhyayan anusandhan santhaan sareekhee sansthaaon ke gathan main madad kare
 There will be no dispute on this nor will it cost much more
 ahm nitigat badlaav jo hue hi nahiharek ghar se ek kilometre ke daayre main skool kholane kii puraani niti kaa nateeja charam vighatan ke rup main saamne aayaa he
 There is a need to change this policy so that schools can be strengthened with free transport facility where needed
 isse mata-pita ke liye bacchon ko skool bhejnaa anivaary banane main aasaani hogi
 India should take part in international evaluations like PISA to "make the problem visible"
 piiese 2010 main jab shanghai duniya bhar main shikhar par tha, ham 74 deshon main 73veen paaydaan par the
 We answered this with the decision that in future we will not take part in it
 artii main bhi sanshodhano or spashtataa kii bahut jarurat he, lekin vahaan bhi koi pragati nahin hui he
 Another major drawback is that information and communication technology (ICT) is not being emphasized too strongly
 yahaan paanch badi pahalon kaa zikr kiya ja rahaa he, jin par abhi koi shuruyaat bhi nahin hui he :(1) prayek skool ke databes (jila shiksha soochna pranali) ko naveenatam bananaa taaki prayek chaatr, shikshak or unke shikshan str par nigaah rakhi ja sake or har vakt iskaa naveenatam aankada uplabdh karavaaya ja sake
 (2) Focus on creating effective software for education through participation
 (3) isiti aadhaarit pranaaliyon par shodh taaki bharat main adhyayan or moolbhoot ganit sareekhee shikshan kii buniyadi kamiyon ko dur kiya ja sake
 (4) Develop a high quality online teacher support system for teachers to use, including videos and other resources
 (5) saste (akaash kii tarah) lekin ucch gunvattta vaale (akaash kii tarah nahin) tablet kaa vikaas karnaa, lekin saath hi iske software ko skulon ke liye upyogi bananaa
 On the whole, instead of merely beating up small programs and schemes, the government should focus on taking concrete steps in those areas which will really make a difference
 shiksha ko badalanaa pechida masalaa he, magar sarkaar is disha main aage badhegi to duusare bhi is prakriya main hissedari ke liye aage aaenge

 Samajwadi Party (SP) president and cousin of former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav and SP MP from Badaun, Dheminder Yadav, termed the appointment of two Deputy Chief Ministers in the Uttar Pradesh BJP government as unconstitutional

 He met the Prime Minister in this regard on Tuesday
 vah pakistan pipuls party (pipipi) ke bhi vakil hai

 grih mantralay kii forenurs division CBI kii jaanch ke ghere main he kyonki kai filein mil nahin raheen
 Earlier, Ishrat's file had disappeared from the internal security division
 udhar anand joshi apni patni ko chitthee likhakar apane ghar se gaayab ho gaye hai
 But this news of this under-secretary is not with the Ministry of Home Affairs
 grih rajya mantri kiren rijiju ne kaha, "hamen abhi pataa nahin he lekin iske bare main jaankaree hiku karenge
 " lekin maamla gambhir he isliye grih mantralay ke forenurs division main sabhi filon kaa audit chal rahaa he
 It is feared that secret notes are missing from many files
 mana ja rahaa he kii ngos se judi samvedansheel janakariyaan jo mantralay ne ikattha kii thi wo un ngos tak pahunch chuki he
 According to information received by NDTV India, the administrative department of the Ministry of Home Affairs is also making new rules regarding how files are routed
 udhar FCRA ke sabhi afasar CBI kii jaanch ke dayare main aa chuke hai
 According to the Home Ministry, Joshi had sent notices to about 60 ngos in November 2015
 in noticeon ke zarie un sabhi ngos se safaai maangi ja rahi thi
 These are all foreign-funded ngos who used to get money from outside
 lekin sawaal he ki kya under secreteri apane aap se is tarah kii karwaai kar saktaa he
 Because to send the notice, approval of senior officer is required
 CBI ab FCRA main kaam karne vaale sabhi afasaron se poochtacha karegi
 The comments anand joshi kii patni bhi aarope sidhe adishnal secreteri bike prasad par laga rahi he
 On the other hand, BK Prasad told NDTV in his cleaning, because he had given a complaint to the CBI and his name is in the FIR, hence he is being targeted
 vaise ye pehali baar nahin jab FCRA division main gadabadi saamne aayi ho
 Earlier, on the issue of visa to Chinese leaders, India has also been very bad, due to this department
 aise main sawaal laazmi he ki akhir chal kya rahaa he grih mantralay main
 On the other hand, Anand Joshi has gone missing from his house by writing a letter to his wife
 lekin apane is under secretary kii ye khabar grih mantralay ke paas nahin he
 Minister of State for Home Kiren Rijiju said, "we do not know right now but haiku will know about it
 " But the matter is serious, so all the files are under audit in the Ministry of Home Affairs' Division
 ashanka he ki kai filon se sikret nots gaayab hai
 It is believed that the sensitive public bodies associated with the ngos have been gathered by the ministry
 enditivi india ko mili jaankaree ke mutabiq grih mantralay kaa prashasnic vibhaag filon to kaise root kiya jaataa he, unke mutlik nae niyam bhi bana rahaa he

 Through these notices, cleanliness was being sought from all those ngos
 ye sabhi videshi madad se chalane vaale ngos hai jinhen baahar se paisa aata tha
 But the question is whether the under-secretary can get such an action done by himself
 kyonki notice bhejne ke liye varisht adhikari kii manjuuri zaruri hoti he
 The CBI will now interrogate all the officers working in FCRA
 tippaniyan Anand Joshi's wife is also directly blaming Additional Secretary BK Prasad
 udhar bike prasad ne apni safaai main enditivi ko bataaya, kyonki unhone CBI ko shikaayat di thi or exiaar main unka naam he isliye unhen nishaanaa banaaya ja rahaa he

 karnataka ke siyaasi galiyare main ek baar phir mukhyamantri siddaramaiya ke thappad kii gunj sunai di he
 CM Sahab, who once slapped an MLA, is in the news this time for slapping a government officer
 bataaya jaataa he ki bheed se pareshaan mukhyamantri ji ko rasta khaali nahin mil rahaa tha to unhone municipal kamishnar ko hi thappad maar diya
 According to the information, the CM of Karnataka was asking the maiyaburokrat to clear the way, when the crowd was enough, he raised his hand in distress
 haalanki siem ke karibiyon kii ore se spashtikaran diya ja rahaa he ki siem ko is baat kii jaankaree nahin thi ki vah shaks jisapar unhone apane bal kaa pradarshan kiya he, bellari ke municipal kamishnar hai
 The crowd and slap incident of innocent people belonged to Bellary on Saturday morning, where CM had come to attend a meeting
 dekhte hi dekhte vahaan mukhyamantri ke samarthakon kii bheed ikattha ho gai
 Everyone wanted to meet their favorite Chief Minister and proceeded to present the bouquet to him
 lekin nadaan janata ko kya pataa ki chunaav ke samay bheed kii chahat rakhane vaale netaji ko ab bheed hi pareshaan karne lagi he
 It is said that during this time, the CM of Bellary came forward, after which CM directly slapped his cheeks
 mukhyamantri se jude logon kaa kahana he ki yah sab bheed main dhakkamukki ke dauraan hui ghatana he
 The argument is also being made that Kisiddaramaiah was not aware that he was the Municipal Commissioner of the person Bellary
 vajah jo bhi ho, bheed se nipatane ke liye thappad kaa istemaal galat hi mana jayega, phir chaahe gaal adhikari kaa ho yaa aam aadmi kaa
 However, from the world of news, pictures and videos of Netaji's 'bahubal' have come up for discussion on social media
 pehle bhi 'pyaar se' maar chuke hai thappadkarnataka ke siem siddaramaiya pehle bhi saarvajanik jagahon par thappad maarane ke dauraan camere main kaid ho chuke hai
 Earlier, he has been seen slapping MLA Shivamurthy, but in response he said that he had killed her with love

 od-evan par aaj guuruuvaar ko hone vaali engiti kii sunwaayee par dilli sarkaar ke saath saath chaar or rajyon kii sarkaron kii nigahen bhi rahegi
 In its review petition, the Delhi government has asked the NGT to order the implementation of aud-even in the rest of the states
 isamen dilli se lage rajya punjab, haryana, uttar pradesh or rajasthan shaamil hai
 In such a situation, what is the NGT that orders the Delhi government to implement the odd-even conditions and will order the states to implement the odd-even? This is a big question
 NGT has already refused to give exemption
 phir bhi apane rivyuu pitishan main dilli sarkaar ne kuch aankade dete hue bataaya he ki kareeb 68 lakh tu whilers dilli main he
 Out of this, around 25 lakh two wheelers will be on the streets of Delhi during odd-even
 agar inako od-ivan se nahin hataaya jaae to dilli ko kareeb 2500 nai bason kii jarurat he, jo abhi philhal sarkaar ke paas nahin he
 Apart from this, the Delhi Government, while giving exemption to women in aud-even, has said that public transport is already congested during aud-even
 aise main agar mahilaon ko bhi shaamil kiya jaae to ye safar unke liye behad takalifdeh safar sabit hoga
 In its review petition, the Delhi government has also told the NGT that women and two wheelers should be kept away till the time the Delhi government arranges 2000 new buses and for this the government needs about 1 year time
 is
 dekhnaa hoga ki pehle hi tu whilers or mahilaon ko lekar kisi bhi riyaayat ko manaa kar chuki engiti dilli sarkaar kii is rivyuu pitishan par koi raahat detii he yaa nahin? Elections in Maharashtra are still far away but political mathematics is taking new colors

 do maheenon ke dauraan chachaa bhattije kii ye teesri mulaakaat he
 Talked for an hour and a half
 kaha to ye gaya ki sehat ko lekar chintit bhattije ne chachaa kaa haal chaal poocha
 With this, for a long time, both of them talked about a book which Bal Thackeray has written
 lekin siyasat par najar rakhane vaale jaanate he ki netaaon main yun hi mulaakaaten nahin hoti or kitabon par itani lambii baat nahin hoti
 Let us tell you that two days ago, in his video message at Shivaji Park in Mumbai, Bal Thackeray cited his growing age and declining health
 udvav or aditya kaa haath majboot karne kii haath jodkar vinati kii thi
 Bal Thackeray did not name Raj anywhere in this entire speech, but he definitely said that we need to think why Shiv Sena was broken
 aaj marathi marathi aamane saamne kyon he
 On the one hand, the uncle's passionate appeal to his nephew, on the other hand, clearly indicates that there will be a lot of change in the picture before the Maharashtra elections

 How much fertilizer is there in the country? 3 in the country
 2 karod ton uria kii jarurat he
 Our domestic production 2
 3 karod ton tak he or baaki 90 lakh ton ham aayaat karte hai
 But in the last 10 years, there was not a single plant in the country, but those which were also closed

 Phulpur plant has been closed recently, how will the country achieve self-sufficiency in urea? See, we can increase production capacity even without setting up a plant
 aayaat kam hoga or adhik utpaadan ke liye ham madad denge
 If the factory accepts this, the production will increase to 2 million tonnes
 is disha main cabinet note banaaya gaya he
 Right now the overall fertilizer policy is under discussion with states and experts

 dhoni ne westeindies kii pehali pari main praveen kumaar kii gend par derren braavo kaa kaich lapakkar yah karnama kiya
 Apart from Dhoni, only Syed Kirmani (160 catches and 38 stumpings) has taken more than 150 catches in Test cricket from India
 apane 55wein test main khel rahe bhartiya captain ne 151 kaich or 25 stamping ke saath 176 shikaar banaaye hai
 Kirmani is India's most successful wicketkeeper with 198 matches in 88 matches

 Opposition parties believe that the Grand Alliance is the need of the hour to face the challenge of the BJP led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 lekin vipakshi kheme main antarvirodhon ke chalate mahagathbandhan ko jamini hakeekat banane kaa rasta philhal aasaan najar nahin aa rahaa
 Two types of thought process can be seen emerging in the opposition camp
 pehali raay ye he ki centre main congress kii ore se gathbandhan banaaya jaae
 In the second opinion, emphasis is being laid on creating a third front of the parties that want to remain separate from both Congress and BJP
 sutron ke mutabik rahul gandhi kii iftaar party main samaajawaadee party kii ore se koi pratinidhi nahin bheje jane se congress khush nahin hai
 That too in such a situation that Samajwadi Party President Akhilesh Yadav himself attended the Eid Milan ceremony of jamiat-e-ulama Hind Chief Arshad Madani
 is samaaroh main dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal bhi maujuud rahe
 Congress sources say that on behalf of the party president Rahul Gandhi, his warlords and state in-charge have already been directed to strengthen the organization at all levels
 khaas taur par booth str par prabandhan ko dhar dene par jor diya gaya he
 In charge of Congress for Chhattisgarh, PL Punia told India Today, "until the grand alliance comes, we are working to strengthen the party organization at the grassroots level
" ham ise lekar chintit nahin he ki mahagathbandhan banataa he yaa nahin
 Rahul Gandhi is watching the situation in every state
 gathbandhan is baat par nirbhar karegaa ki kisi rajya vishesh kii kya sthiti he
 'segmentation of seats is also a big issue in the way of the Grand Alliance
 haal main samaajawaadee party ke netaaon kii ore se sanket diya gaya ki party uttar pradesh main congress ke liye do siten hi chhodane ke paksh main he
 Left parties and Congress have also been targeted on several occasions in the past by Trinamool Congress supremo Mamata Banerjee
 haal main dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal or uparajyapal ke bich takaraav ke dauraan jis tarah mamata banerjee or karnataka ke mukhyamantri echdi kumaraswami ne dilli main aakar kejariwal kaa samarthan kiya wo bhi mukhya vipakshi party congress ko raas nahin aayaa
 The Congress believes that this indicated that the opposition is not united
 sipiai netaa or rajyasabha sadsy di raja kaa kahana he, 'har party apane hisaab se pojishning kar rahi he or har ek kii koshish adhik se adhik siton par chunaav ladane kii he
 But we are working on this strategy so that the opposing parties do not forget their original objective and that is to defeat the BJP
 isliye sabhi dalon ko vyaavhaarik drushti se kaam karnaa chahie or ek duusare ke liye zyada udaartaa baratani chahie
 However, the leaders of opposing parties are also saying that it is too early to talk about the grand alliance
 saath hi unka ye bhi kahana he ki philhal ve aisi ranneeti par jor de rahe hai jisase sabhi ko ek chhatari ke neeche laayaa ja sake
 Congress leader Pramod Tiwari says, 'the Congress president has already said that we will unite all like-minded parties and defeat the BJP
 'congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne party kii ore se ‘samvidhan bachaao’ campagne kii shuruyaat par kaha tha ki mahagathbandhan ne aakaar lenaa shuru kar diya he or chah maheene main ye astitv main aa jayega
 US President Barack Obama said that al-qaeda leader Osama bin Laden and his assistant have gone to a very safe place due to the ongoing anti-terrorism campaign in the Af Pak region
 lekin unhone yah bhi aagaah kiya ki america ko satark rahane kii jarurat he
 On the eve of the ninth anniversary of the September 11 attack on the World Trade Tower, Obama said, "in the last two years we have been very successful in that we have increased the pressure on al Qaeda and its key leaders
" ’unhone kaha, ‘‘parinamswaroop unke liye aise halaat paidaa ho gayi hai ki unhen kaam karnaa behad kathin mahasoos ho rahaa he
 "obama said," Because of what happened, bin Laden went into a deep cave
 yahaan tak ki baar baar baahar aane vaala jawahiri bhi ab zyada sartak ho gaya he
 ' kai kitaaben ghatnaon kii tarah hoti hai
 Some major decisive incidents happen in life
 aap kitaab padhate nahin, kitaab khud ko padhwa leti he or aapaki smritiyon main apni jagah bana leti he
 The Borunda Diary of Malchand Tiwari: Vida Geet of Unmatched Bijji is one such book
 kitaab nahin, balki unke jivan ke antim dinon kaa dastavej he
 There are some random vignettes
 padhate hue lagata he maano bijji saamne baithe hai or likhaa hua sabakuch darasal ghat rahaa he ankhon ke saamne
 Like a cinema is going on
 tiwadi rajasthani lekhak vijaydaan detha yani bijji ke antim dinon main kaaphi samay tak unke gaanv main unke saath rahe
 While living there, he was translating his book Bataan Phulwari written in Rajasthani in Hindi
 borunda diary bijji ke unheen antim dinon kii diary he, jisamen unki rosemara kii baaten darj hai
 Bijji is turning books, magazines with his misty eyes
 budhi ankhon main ab na pard paane kii pidaa he
 They hear the sound of water dripping into the room
 pani darasal tapak nahin rahaa, phir bhi sunai de rahaa he
 He is remembering his wife, counting the bowls in the food plate of Tiwari, if she is healthy, she is eating with great taste, she is taking a bath in the winter, cannot read, and is asking to read it
 Are, doing Tagada, wrote the diary last night or not
 ghabara rahe hai kabhi bachche kii tarah to kabhi khush hai duulhe kii tarah
 Only sat for one day
 bole, ''tu lekhak kii maut par itnaa acha likhata he to mujh par likhakar mujhe padhwa de
 After death, only others will study
 main kaise padhuunga? " yahi to hai bijji
 We all love in life
 lekin kabhi aise mahasoos karnaa ki kisi kaa hona hi pyaar ho jaae
 Throughout Bijji's presence there was all the emotion, tenderness and truth that one has in love
 bijji kii smritiyon se chhanakar vah sara pyaar is kitaab main bhi umad aayaa he
 Those who know, after reading this diary, they would like to know more
 jo nahin jaanate, unke likhe kii talash main bhatakenge
 He will study Bijji by searching
 rosemara kii jindagi ke sab kaarobaar ke bich vakt chura laaenge taaki unhen or-or jaan saken
 It would be a great strength and appreciation of a book that it should meet the reader's head
 jise padhane vaala darasal use jeene lage
 This is the strength of this book
 jaise tulsidas ne kaha tha ki main to kuch nahin
 a minor person
 koi gyaata, koi vidwaan nahin
 If that story was of Rama, it was written and became great
 tiwadi bhi kuch usee andaaj main kehete hai, ''main bhala koun? wo to katha bijji kii thi to kitaab badi ho gai

 bacchee uski harakatein dekhakar ghabara gai or shor machaane lagi
 During this time, a passer-by passing by heard the voice of the girl and ran towards the forest
 usne maukey par jaakar dekha ki aaropee yuvak bacchee ke sathrapaki koshish kar rahaa tha
 The passerby made noise and called people

 Much has been written about Sasikala, the leader of the AIDMK Legislature Party in Tamil Nadu
 ab vah rajya kii mukhyamantri ban sakati hai
 So, in view of some recent events, let's see which 5 film roles Sasikala can fit into
 amaidhi padai kii amaavasai ke role main1
 In the role of Amavasai in the Tamil film Amaidhi Padai, Shashikala is very fit
 donon main samanta ye he ki ek vakt main amavasaai or shashikala powerful rajaneta ke kareeb rah chuki hai
 Apart from this, Amavasai himself had attained the position till he removed his own leader from the throne
 2
 The way things related to Sasikala have changed after Chandramukhi's Ganga Jayalalithaa's death, in such a way, she also fits into Chandramukhi's Ganga's role
 film main ganga khud kii kalpana chandramukhi ke taur par karti hai
 The film also has a famous dialogue in which it is said - Ganga poses like Chandramukhi
 
 
 or phir ganga chandramukhi ban jaati hai
 3
 pudhupettai kii kocki kumaar kii tarahatamil cinema kii behtareen filmon main se ek pudhupettai main ek gangster kocki kumaar kii kahani he
 However, you may wonder what its relation to Sasikala's character
 lekin film dekhne par aapako maaloom chalegaa ki donon kairactor ke dimag main ek si hi chijen chal rahi hoti hai
 4
 sathuranga wettai main gadhi babu kii tarahshashikala ek chote shahar se aati hai
 Many of Sasikala's relatives hold key positions in the AIADMK
 un par aay se adhik sampatti ke aarope bhi lage hai
 In such a situation, Sasikala can also be very perfect in the role of Gandhi Babu of the film
 5
 In the role of Katappa of Bahubali, there are many controversial allegations against Sasikala
 jayalalita kii maut par bhi kai sawaal uth rahe hai
 The question is whether Sasikala killed Jayalalithaa? In such a situation, Sasikala can also fit in the role of Katappa of Bahubali film

 Although terrorist groups continue to carry out attacks in Pakistan, most Pakistani citizens see India as a major threat, see America as an enemy and they are not particularly worried about the Taliban and al-qaeda

 Howrah Bridge has been the hallmark of Calcutta (now Kolkata), Howrah and Hooghly River for a long time
 brij kii khubsuurati nadi main or nadi kii khubsuurati brij main he
 You can call the river Hooghly river Ganges the lifeline of both Kolkata and Howrah
 lekin kooday or naalon kii gandagi se is ‘lifline’ kaa khud hi jeena muhaal ho gaya he
 The Ganges enters West Bengal from the Sundarbans delta before being absorbed into the Bay of Bengal in its last stop
 yahi vajah he ki yahaan nadi main gandagi kaa str sabase zyada he
 In West Bengal, 222 big and small drains carry all the dirt with them into the Ganges
 visheshgy bataate hai ki kis tarah kooda karkat, rasayan or kitnashak ganga ko pradooshit kar rahe hai
 Even after crores of rupees have been spent by the Government of India and the municipal bodies, the situation on ground zero does not seem to be getting better
 is reporter kii ore se nadi ke ghat par durga puja utsav ko 2005 se hi cover kiya ja rahaa he
 The situation has changed a lot since then
 ab sirf saanskrithik aasthaa ke chalate hi pratimaaon kaa visarjan kiya jaataa he
 But while immersing the idol, all the material along with it is removed first
 lekin ye sirf durga puja utsav ke dauraan kiya jaataa he jab donon shaharon main kareeb 5000 pratimaaon ko visarjeet kiya jaataa he
 But the rules are not followed due to the lack of strictness on the small puja festivals that run throughout the year

 According to Dutta, the solution is to prevent the sewage water from falling everywhere in the Ganges without treating it
 iske liye bade paimaane par sivej drenez system banaae jane kii jarurat he
 The solution cannot be limited to Bengal alone

 There are 80 small and big cities, about 1000 villages inhabited by Ganga
 drenez sivej system ganga ke donon kinaaron par banaae jane kii jarurat he
 Industrial waste should be controlled
 ganga ke kinare kooda nahin jamaa hone dena chahie
 These are issues that need immediate attention

 India Today reporter was seen in a place of filth
 puure ghat par punaruddhar kaa kaam beshak chal rahaa ho lekin yahaan kooday ke pahaad kisi kii najar se batch nahin sakate

 There are more than 160,000 fecal coliform bacteria per liter here
 har din badi maatra main bina treet kiya hua sivej kaa pani ganga main miltaa he
 In such a situation, it is not empty of danger to use the water of the Ganges for even a bath
 ye bengal or shahar ke logon ke liye gambhir baat he
 Pesticides and chemicals should be prevented from falling into the Ganges at all costs along with control over industrial waste

 wo nadi, jise rajya kii lifline kaha jaataa he, usamenpradooshan kiwajah se rajya kaa bhavishya andhkaar main najar aata he
 Kolkata, which is called the 'city of Joy', but considering the plight of the Ganges here, it is not a big deal in future to be known as 'city of Stink'
 ganga kii kul lambaai 2500 kilometre he
 The last 250–260 km of this falls in West Bengal
 kolkata ek pracheen shahar he
 The human population has been inhabited here for centuries
 udyog-dhandhon kii neenv bhi yahaan bahut pehle pad gai thi
 Therefore, pollution of Ganga is also highest here
 pradooshan badhane kii vajah se hi 1984 main ganga ection plan shuru hua
 The West Bengal government on December 17 last year allocated Rs 34 crore to develop 7 ghats, including Dakshineswar and Belur
 187 varsh puraane babughat kaa saundaryikaran bhi isi project kaa hissaa tha
 Funds are also needed for strengthening the banks of the ghats as well as for landscaping and proper lighting on the pier
 babughat par har din badi sankhya main shraddhaluon kaa aana hota he
 Money is being spent in the name of cleanliness, but to make Ganga again 'holy', Bhagiratha works are definitely needed

 pashchim bengal main sibiai or kolkata police main takaraar jari he
 Kolkata Police prevented the CBI from interrogating Commissioner Rajiv Kumar and also surrounded the CBI office
 police kaa aarope he ki sibiai kii team ke paas poochtacha sambandhi koi dastavej nahin the
 In such a situation, it may be interesting for you to know that West Bengal is one of the states where there is a 'ban' on CBI entry
 darasal pichley saal november main pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee ne rajya main sibiai kii entry par bain laga di thi
 During that time Mamata Banerjee had alleged that these days the Central Government is using the CBI and other agencies for its political interests
 iske baad ab sibiai ko kisi bhi prakaar kii jaanch karne ke liye rajya sarkaron kii anumati leni hogi
 However, if the court orders in a case, permission will not have to be obtained
 haalanki pashchim bengal nahin, desh main kai aise or rajya bhi hai, jahaan sibiai kii entry par roak he
 Explain that to ban the entry of CBI, the state governments withdraw the general consent given to the CBI for the use of powers under the law in the state, after which an order is to be taken for action
 haalanki kuch paristhitiyon main niyam alag hote hai
 Which states have CBI ban? Let us tell you that before West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu had banned CBI entry
 chandrababu naidu ke faisle kaa hi mamata banerjee ne samarthan kiya tha
 Andhra Pradesh had earlier passed an order granting the CBI a 'general', which was withdrawn
 vahiin is list main chhattisgarh kaa bhi naam he
 The Chhattisgarh government had recently banned the entry of CBI in January

 ucch nyaayalay kii fatkaar ke baad aakhirkaar mahipal maderna kii barkhaastagi ko majaboor hui rajasthan congress kii ab rojaanaa fajihat kaa adhyay shuru ho gaya he
 As soon as Maderna's appearance in Rajasthan is like that of Madhumita scandal convict Amarmani Tripathi, Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot may have shied away from him at the behest of the high command, but the long list of tainted ministers in his cabinet will not let him sit still
 gahalot mantrimandal main darjan bhar aise mantri hai, jin par yaa to sidhe mukademe darj ho chuke hai yaa jo aaropon ke ghere main hai
 Gehlot himself, who has prepared to change the department of Home Minister Shanti Dhariwal in the Gopalgarh case to save his chair, but Gehlot's failure is clearly seen from the confidential internal note sent by Dhariwal to the Chief Minister before the riots
 18 agast ko bheje note main grih mantri ne sthaneey str par hui baithkon ke baad mukhyamantri ko aagaah kiya tha ki police adheekshak hinglaj daan maamle ko sanbhaalane main sakasham nahin hai, lekin tainaati or tabadale main sthaneey vidhayak ke prabhaav ko dhyaan main rakh gahalot ne chuppi saadh lee
 This note of the Home Ministry also opens the account of the report of the Rashid Alvi team sent by the Congress high command, in which only Dhariwal has been blown
 india today se baatcheet main rajya ke grih mantri shanti dhariwal apane is note kii pushti karte hai
 He says, "I don't remember the date, but around August 18, i submitted my report to the Chief Minister

 However, his ministers have been instrumental in tainting Gehlot's image

 But despite the accusations of the big ministers of the Gehlot government, the silence of the Chief Minister and the harsh rebukes of the High Court in the Bhanwari case have put the Congress in a defensive position

 The High Court strongly commented, 'never seen such a weak government

 After this harsh remark, Gehlot knocked in the Delhi court and got the green signal to sack Maderna

 Former Team India player Yuvraj Singh announced his retirement from cricket on Monday
 is maukey par tamaam diggajon ne unhen nai pari ke liye shubhakamanaayen di
 In this episode, Suvvinder Bawa, who was the coach of Yuvraj Singh, opened many secrets about this former player of Team India
 vaise to yuvaraj ke pita yograj singh ne unhen cricket se rubaru karaayaa or aage lekar aae lekin yuvaraj 15-16 saal kii umr main sukhwinder ke paas pahunche the or tab se yuvaraj ko nikhaarane main sukhwinder kaa bada haath he
 On the retirement of this disciple, Sukhwinder said, 'for me he will always be a legend
 uske liye yah faisla lene kaa sahi vakt tha
 i think he was the biggest comeback in cricket history, so he is a legend
 ''jab maine poocha wicket kyon phenkaa, yuvi bolaa- team ko meri jarurat thi'sukhwinder ne bharat ke liye 400 se adhik match khilne vaale yuvaraj ke liye kaha, 'aap logon ne tivi par uskaa agreshan
 Have seen his passion
 asal jindagi main vah bilkul aisa nahin he
 He is alive vah jo kuch karata he, desh ke liye karata he
 He did not play a single innings for himself
 maine kai baar tokaa ki apana wicket kyon phenk diya to kahata tha- sar vahaan team ko meri jarurat thi
 So, i made this decision for the country
 'galat ke khilaaf hameshaa bolne vaala tha yuvarajbawa ke mutabik jo insaan galat dekhakar uske khilaaf aawaaj uthaanaa jaanata ho, uske andar agreshan to hona hi chahie or yuvaraj bhi aisa hi he
 Bawa, he cannot close his eyes to see what is wrong
 vah uske khilaaf aawaaj uthaata he or halaat sudhaarney kii koshish karata he
 It is necessary to be aggressive
 agar aisa na ho to insaan laash ho jaataa he
 Yuvraj mentally strong Yuvraj's career has been exciting and inspiring
 2011 world cap ke dauraan hi cancer ke lakshan dikhne lage the lekin yuvi ne haar nahin maani or desh ko 28 saal baad sirmaur banaaya
 After this, the country came to know that Yuvi has cancer
 sabakaa bura haal tha or coach isse alag nahin the
 Bava believes that a person who can beat cancer on the strength of his will, no need to explain how strong he is mentally
 wo hameshaa poochta tha ki main team india ke liye kab kheloongaa?coach ne kaha, vah cancer ke khilaaf jang jitkar aayaa he
 Think about how strong he will be mentally
 beemaari ke kaaran sharir thodaa kamjor hua or vah khel kii jaruraton ke hisaab se khud ko dhaal nahin paaya
 In this order, those who were competing with him went ahead
 sukhwinder kehete hai ki yuvaraj bachapan main lagaataar unase poochta rahata ki wo india kab khelegaa or jabaav main coach apane shishy ke liye taregat set kar dete the
 Similarly, while referring to a sentence, Sukhwinder said, he used to repeatedly say when i will play India
 aise main main uske liye target set karata tha
 i used to say that you play Ranji first
 usne jab ranjai khelaa to maine kaha tu saikadaa laga to main tujhse 5000 rupee kaa ribok kaa juuta luungaa
 Yuvi had sent a shoe after the first century as a gift
 He also sent me a shoe when he made the first 100 in the Ranji Trophy against Haryana
 usamen pratibha to thi, lekin mujhe andar se bahut strong feeling aati thi ki vah bharat ke liye khelegaa
 i even thought that it would also captain the Indian team in the World Cup and i would sit in the dressing room and watch the match
 sukhwinder ne yuvaraj kii maa shabnam ke yogadan ko bhi unke kariyar main ahm bataaya he, jo balldor par hameshaa apane bete ke saath jindagi ke har utaar-chadhaav main khadi raheen
 Yuvraj also said in his last address Monday that his mother has given birth to him twice and has been a source of strength for him

 lekin abhi ummidavaaron ke naamon kaa elaan nahin ho paaya he
 LJP leader Chirag Paswan said that we have selected our candidates but due to the internal infighting in the Grand Alliance, the situation has not been finalized yet
 sutron se mili jaankaree ke anusaar algepi ne samastipur se ramchandra paswan ko tikat diya he
 Pashupati Kumar Paras from Hajipur has been given the responsibility of the party
 jamui se chiraag paswan khud chunaav ladenge
 On the other hand, Veena Singh, wife of MLC Dinesh Singh has been given ticket from Vaishali Lok Sabha seat and Veena Devi, wife of Surajbhan Singh from Nawada seat
 bataa den ki ramvilaasapaaswan hajipur loksabhaa seat se chunaav ladate rahe hai lekin is baar unhone chunaav nahin ladane kaa faisla kiya he
 Paswan will probably go to Rajya Sabha
 chiraag paswan jamui se chunaav ladane kaa elaan kar chuke the, patni chunaav ladanaa nahin chaahati hai, bhai pashupati bihar sarkaar main mantri he
 Therefore, there was a lot of speculation on who would replace Ram Vilas Pass
 aapako bataa den ki ravivaar ko vashishtha narayan singh ne press conference karke siton ke bantwaare kii jaankaree di thi
 In terms of seat sharing, JDU will contest most seats in Seemanchal
 jisamen kishanganj or bhagalpur bhi shaamil he
 Ram Vilas Paswan's Rashtriya Lok Janashakti Party (LJP) has got six seats
 bihar kii kul 40 loksabhaa siton main se is baar bijepi or jediu 17-17 siton par chunaav lard raheen hai
 Whereas the Lok Janshakti Party has got six seats
 dilli main smog or pradooshan ke kahar bich ab is par raajnneeti bhi tej ho gai he
 Delhi BJP President Manoj Tiwari reached among the people on Thursday and distributed a pollution mask to the people
 is dauraan unhone dilli ke siem arvind kejariwal par bhi nishaanaa saadhaa
 Manoj Tiwari arrived in Connaught Place on Thursday morning and wore masks to the people with his hands
 unhone yahaan tainaat police waalon ko bhi mask baante or unsepolushnake dinon main duty ke saath sehat kaa bhi dhyaan rakhane ko kaha
 He then blamed Delhi CM for the spread of pollution in Delhi
 unhone kaha ki kejariwal ab khud ko victim dikhaa rahe hai, jab pradooshan is had tak bad gaya
 But why did he not take any step towards this earlier? tiwari ne kejariwal par aarope lagaate hue kaha ki unhone haryana ke siem manohar laal khatter se abhi tak koi meeting nahin kii, jabaki wo jaanate the ki dilli main is mausam mempradooshan kii samasyahoti hi he
 Tiwari said that he himself has spoken to Haryana CM Khattar over the phone and Khattar told him that he was paying attention to the problem of burning Palali
 manoj tiwari ke mutabik khatter ne unako aashwaasan diya he ki sarkaar kisaanon se 500 rupee prati ton kii dar se palaali kharidegi or uskaa istemaal west tu energy plant main karegi
 Kejriwal Sarkar Distributed maskdelhi BJP President Manoj Tiwari has urged Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal to distribute pollution masks free of cost to his government in Mohalla clinics or in government offices
 tiwari ne kaha ki bijepi kaaryakarta bhi ek hafte main 10 hajaar polyushan mask puri dilli main baantenge
 He said that whoever gets the support of mps can become the Prime Minister
 yah puche jane par ki kya unke putr or lojpa sansadeey board ke adhyaksh chiraag paswan ke notebandi ke dauraan logon ko hui kathinaayee ko lekar vitt mantri arun jetali ko likhe gaye patr kaa koi jawaab unhen mila yaa nahin, ramvilas ne kaha ki vah patr unhone notebandi ke shuruaati daur main logon kii kathinaayeeyon ke maddenjar likhaa tha par (media or vipaksh ne) ise seat saajha se jodakar pesh kiya
 He said, 'the NDA has finalized seat sharing for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections in Bihar, but the grand alliance of opposition parties is yet to take shape and the seats shared between the constituents and the parties in its alliance in Bihar are far away
 The team involved is also unclear
 ' ramvilas ne kaha ki congress bihar main mahagathbandhan main shaamil he par uttar pradesh main sapa-basapa ke gathbandhan se use baahar rakhaa gaya
 On the other hand, Lok Janshakti Party (lajpa) MP Chirag Paswan once again refused to consider Ram Mandir as an election issue and said that development should be the issue in the election
 unhone kaha, 'ayodhya main ram mandir ke mudde par adaalat kaa jo faisla hoga, hamsab ko sweekaar hoga
 He said that 10 percent reservation to the poor of the general class will help in bridging the gap between rich and poor in the society
 unhone ram mandir vivaad kii charchaa karte hue kaha ki pradhanmantri narendra modi bhi kah chuke hai vah is maamle main adaalat ke faisle kaa intjaar karenge or adhyadesh nahin laaenge
 The Maharashtra government has refused to make Aamir Khan the brand ambassador of the Jalyukt Shivar campaign

 aaj vah record kaayam rahaa, jo shikhar dhawan ke naam he
 Shikhar, known as 'gabbar', has won the match whenever he has scored a century
 aaj phir vahi hua
 Shikhar Dhawan scored a brilliant 137 runs and India won the match against South Africa by 130 runs
 yah shikhar dhawan ke ekadivasiy kariyar kaa saatvaan shatak tha or dakshin africa ke khilaaf doosraa
 Shikhar also scored the first century of his ODI career against South Africa
 ekadivasiy match main yah shikhar dhawan kaa sarvocch score he, lekin aaj vah record tut gaya, jo dakshin africa ke naam tha
 In the World Cup, South Africa had won the match chasing victory after losing the toss three times against India
 aaj bhi dakshin africa toss haara or 307 ran kii jeet kii peechha karte hue yah match haar gaya
 If seen, winning the toss proved to be a boon for India
 mahendra singh dhoni ne aaj shandaar captaini kii
 It seemed that due to weak bowling, Dhoni would decide to win the toss, but Dhoni expressed confidence in his bowlers and the bowlers did not let the confidence break
 dhoni ne sahi samay par apane bolors kaa istemaal kiya
 Today, all the bowlers of India, bowling brilliantly, did not let the South African batsmen dominate
 aaj ke match main mohammad shami, mohit sharma or umesh yadav jahaan bowling power play main ran rate rokane main safal rahe, vahiin ravichandran aswin or rabindra jadeja ne wicket lene main kamyaabi hasil kii
 For India, whenever the spinners took two wickets between 11 and 41 overs, India won that match
 lekin aaj spinners ne shandaar bowling karte hue 11 se 41 over ke bich chaar wicket jatke, jisamen teen wicket aswin or ek wicket jadeja ko mila
 But from a statistics standpoint, South Africa's winning percentage of chasing victories since 2011 has been close to just 34, while batting first, its win percentage is close to 75
 aaj bharat kii fielding bhi shandaar rahi
 AB de Villiers' run out was the turning point of the match
 shandaar form main chal rahe divilliars ko mohit sharma ne 30 ran ke nijee score par ran out kiya
 David Miller, the most dangerous batsman in South Africa, was also run out
 is vajah se dakshin africa ke upar dabaab badhata gaya or uski puri team sirf 170 ran par ol out ho gai
 It seems that number 7 proved auspicious for India
 pehle ballebaaji karte hue ne bharat 307 ran banaae, shikaar dhawan ne 137 ran kii pari kheli, ajinkya rahane ne 79 ran kii shandaar pari kheli, jisamen 7 chaukaa shaamil tha or dakshin africa kii team 177 ran par ol out ho gai

 madhya pradesh main vande maataram nahin gane par shivaraj singh chouhan ne congress par hamalaa bolaa to iske turant baad kamalnath ne bhi palatwaar kar diya
 In fact, earlier in the BJP government, the national anthem was sung in the secretariat on the first working day of the month
 magar is baar kamalnath sarkaar main saal ke pehle din hi iskaa paalan nahin ho sakaa or is tarah se 13 saal puraani parampara tut gai
 Attacking this, Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan said that if the Congress feels ashamed to sing the national anthem, then he himself will sing Vande Mataram in the Secretariat

 i demand that the song of Vande Mataram should always be in the courtyard of Vallabh Bhavan before every cabinet meeting and on the first date of every month
 'congress shaayad yah bhul gai he ki sarkarein aati he, jaati he lekin desh or deshbhakti se upar kuch nahin he
 i demand that the anthem of Vande Mataram be in the courtyard of Vallabh Bhavan as always before every cabinet meeting and on the first date of every month
 unhone aage kaha ki 'vande maataram ke kaaran logon ke hriday main prajvalit deshbhakti kii bhaawanaaon main nayi urja kaa sanchaar hota tha
 It is very unfortunate that the Congress government broke this tradition today
 aaj pehali tarikh ko vande maataram nahin gaaya gaya!'ek anya twit main shivaraj singh chouhan ne kaha ki 'agar kagress ko raashtra geet ke shabd nahin aate hai yaa phir raashtra geet ke gayan main shame aati he, to mujhe bataa den! har maheene kii pehali taarikh ko vallabh bhawan ke praangan main janata ke saath vand maataram main gaaungaa
