 a very shocking case of human death has come to light in the capital Delhi
 yahaan ek pati apni patni kii laash lekar paanch ghante tak sadakon par bhatakta rahaa
 He appealed to the people for help on the way, but the humanity in the society was dead
 ghatana dilli ke anand vihaar ilaake kii he
 Actually on Monday evening, a woman named Anju died while undergoing treatment
 mahila kii laash ko uske pati chhotelal ke hawaale kiya gaya
 From private ambulance, Chhotalal took the wife's body from the hospital to the house
 magar julm dekhie, makanamalik ne chhotelal ko patni ke shav ko ghar main rakhane se saaf inkaar kar diya
 The dead body was lying in an ambulance
 bebas chhotelal patni kilashlekar phir se aspataal pahunchaa, magar samaaj ke thekedaaron ne use yahaan bhi raahat nahin di
 The bloodthirsty guards of the hospital ordered him to leave the hospital after some time
 laash ko ambulance main liye teen ghante biit chuke the
 Then the ambulance driver also demanded money, but Chhotalal did not have much money to give to the ambulance driver
 jis kaaran ambulance chaalak bhi chhotelal se laash ambulance se nikaalane ke liye baar-baar kahata rahaa
 Eventually the ambulance driver too left the corpse and left it
 vakt bitta gaya or bebas chhotelal maanavtaa ke asli farebi chehron se waakif hota rahaa
 After which, for five hours, Chhotalal roamed the streets carrying his wife's body
 tabhi vahaan gasht kar rahi ekapulisteam kii us par najar padi
 The policemen arranged for the wife's body to be kept in a house
 chhotelal ne apane makanamalik par uske saath jyaadati karne kaa aarope lagaaya
 At the same time, the landlord said in his cleaning that he had helped Chhotalal
 saath hi uski patni ke antim sanskaar kaa kharch uthaane kii bhi baat kahi thi
 However, this incident has not only taught Chhotlal a lesson, but has also exposed his real face by keeping a mirror in front of the society

 ) What were the days when gallant songs were written in the pride of Team India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni
 koi chalisa paath karata to koi 'maahi katha' vaachan
 Captain Sir was like this
 jis par haath rakh diya vahi ban jaae sitara
 The one who decided was called the master stroke
 par har cricketer kii jindagi utaar-chadhaav bhari hoti he
 You saw the picture above
 darasal, ye najaara newjiland ke saath aaj hi khatm hue wellington test kaa he
 Brendon mccullum stood at the crease
 pareshaan dhoni ne part time of spinner rohit sharma ko gendbaaji ke liye bulaayaa
 He also applied slip
 par uski pojishan dekhakar har koi dang ho gaya
 The slip fielder stood where the slip fielder is usually for the fast bowler
 dhoni ne yah fielder maikulam ke kis shot ke liye lagaaya tha ye shodh kaa vishay he
 But this strategy of Dhoni is bound to be questioned? As soon as Team India won the World Cup in 2011, Dhoni came in the list of greatest captains of the country
 phir aayaa england daura
 Where everything changed
 hamane haarana sikh liya
 Continued to lose
 is nashe ke aadi ho gaye
 Since June 2011, India has played a total of 15 Tests on foreign soil
 10 main haar, 4 dra or sirf ek jeet
 Only Zimbabwe's record in world cricket is so bad
 shaayad maahi kii mahanata ko darshane ke liye ye kaaphi he
 It is not that India did not get a chance to win in the last three years
 par captain sahab ke rahasyamayi faisle or defensive soch ne har maukey ko ganvaaya
 In June 2011, the team was likely to win in the Lord's Test
 trentbrij test ke pehle do din bharat kii pakad majboot thi
 We started well on the first day of the Melbourne Test in Australia
 johanisburg or wellington test to hamaara jeetna tay tha
 But we took the 'draw from the mouth of victory'
 in sabhi maichon main ek baat samaan he, dhoni ne ahm maukey ganvaae
 England's score was 5 wickets for 72 runs till lunch on the fourth day of the Lord's Test
 gend 31 over puraani
 But after 40 minutes Dhoni starts bowling with Suresh Raina and Harbhajan
 trentbrij test main england kaa score 8 wicket par 124 ran
 But Dhoni sets up a defensive field in front of Steward Broad and Tim Bresnan
 wellington test match ke chauthe din
 If the edge was removed, New Zealand's score was 6 for 5 wickets
 din kaa pehla seshan
 Ball just 19 overs old
 tej gendbaajon ko mila tha puri raat kaa aaraam
 Adopting an aggressive strategy was the only solution here
 lekin sirf 7 over, or dhoni par defensive soch haaavee ho gaya
 The team returned to a run-saving strategy
 kabhi-kabhi lagata he ki dhoni akasar ye bhul jate hai wicket lene se ran apane aap ruk jate hai
 But his strategy is different from others
 pehle ran roko, wicket to kabhi na kabhi mil hi jayega
 Perhaps, this planning goes on Indian pitches, but it fails on foreign soil
 mana dhoni ke paas del sten or mishael johnson nahin he
 But teams choose the same
 kya plaing ilevan main paanch gendbaaj nahin khel sakate
 The question is trustworthy
 kya maahi ko apane ballebaajon par nahin gendbaajon par zyada bharosa he?ranneeti bananaa captaini kaa hissaa he
 If you fail on this issue then you will be surrounded by questions
 aaj kii taarikh main aam sawaal ye he ki kya dhoni ko test captaini chhodani chahie? par ahm sawaal yah he ki kya dhoni test team kii captaini karnaa chaahate hai? sawaal ravaiye kaa he
 The responsibility is to enjoy
 dhoni ko dekhakar aisa nahin lagata
 In January 2012, Dhoni indicated that by the end of 2013, he would say goodbye to one of the formats of cricket
 ye 2014 ke farvari kaa maheenaa he
 Well! i don't know about Test cricket, but i should leave the captaincy
 isamen koi shaq nahin dhoni aaj kii taarikh main bharat ke sabase behtareen wicketiper ballebaaj hai
 But how can the captain, Dhoni only answer this
 record sudhaar kar
 The tour of England and Australia is due this year
 yaa phir bahut der ho chuki he
 Nowadays there is no season for change of system
 kya pataa lahar main dhoni raaj rahe, na rahe
 Maharashtra Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan has urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to convene a meeting of Chief Ministers to discuss the deepening power crisis
 bijli sankat kii vajah se kam se kam paanch rajyon par bura prabhaav padaa he
 In a letter to the Prime Minister, Chavan said that some serious issues regarding fuel availability have emerged after the bids were finalized on the basis of competition for power supply from the private sector

 These tunes of the national anthem are ripping the strong morning breeze flowing from the courtyard of Pullela Gopichand Badminton Academy in Gachibowli area of hyderabad
 raashtragan gane waalon main bharat ke behtareen badminton khiladiah sina nehwal, parupalli kashyap, pi
 V
 sindhu, aaremavi gurusain dutt or kam se kam 20 duusare khilaadi shaamil hai
 Twice a week they take inspiration from the national anthem
 academy ke bheetar kadam rakhane se pehle bahut-se khilaadi sheesh nava kar farsh ko pehle haath se or phir maathe se sparsh karte hai
 With this one sentiment you can understand how important this Gurukul is for each of them
 agar ve 10 saal pehle ke bharat main badminton khilaadi rahe hote to is tarah kii academy kii kalpana bhi nahin kar sakate the
 Today this dream has come true and all the credit goes to only one person and they are National Badminton Coach Pullela Gopichand
 aaj is academy main 150 yuva badminton khilaadi prashikshan le rahe hai, jinamein se 40 rahete bhi vahiin hai
 There are eight coaches and six support staff for training
 aath yonnex cotrce ke saath ek swimming pool, health club, rihaib or welnes centre, ek footbal kaa maidan, daudaahe ke liye trek, barf or bhaap main nahaane kii suvidha, jakuji or ek cafeteria he
 Gopichand says, “when i used to play, i went abroad in search of a better place to train
 kabhi-kabhi mujhe daakhila dene se hi inkaar kar diya jaataa tha
 The reason: The coaches there did not want the outsiders to know how their system works
 main sochaa karata tha ki kaash! hamaare yahaan koi aisi jagah hoti to hamen unke saamne haath nahin failaane padate
 Gopichand won the All England title in 2001
 uske baad andhra pradesh sarkaar ne 2003 main yah academy banane ke liye gopichand ko paanch acre jameen di
 But the Rs 13 crore needed to build it
 jutanaa unke liye sachmuch tedi kheer thi
 Gopichand remembers that even today, when he used to go to big companies and said that we have world class players, he used to laugh and said that come tomorrow
 or vah kal kabhi nahin aata tha
 Gopichand paid three crores
 jutaney ke liye apana makaan girvee rakh diya
 Five Crores Rs
 kaa chanda udyogpati or media maalik nimmagarhda prasad ne diya
 He had also placed a condition for this? An Olympic medal
 gopichand ne apana vaada puraa kiya or pichley saal sina nehwal ne landan olympic main kaansya padak jitkar dikhaaya
 During his playing days, Gopichand himself struggled with lack of good quality shuttle cock
 us jamaane main rihaib yaa vishwastar kii training kii koi soch hi nahin thi, praayojak bhi naa ke baraabar hua karte the
 There were not too many coaches who have the ability to get rid of the dominance of Chinese players
 khilaadi ke rup main samay puraa hone ke baad 2003 kii garmiyon main gopichand ne kuch bacchon ko sikhaanaa shuru kiya
 Saina, then 14, was one of them
 sina main gopichand ko apana aks najar aayaa—unheen ke jaisaa jujharupan or badminton ke bade-bade dhurandharon se aatankit hone se inkaar
 Gopi fully engaged in teaching Saina
 is lagan or mehnat kii parinti pichley saal agast main us vakt khushi ke pal main badal gai jab sina kii gardan main olympic kaansya padak pahanaaya gaya
 The Guru and the disciple saw the tricolor being waved at Wembley Arena in London with moist eyes
 haryana main janmi sina aaj na sirf bhartiya badminton kii dhwajvahak hai balki unka kad isliye bhi bada he kyonki unhone chini badminton kii oonchi diwaar ko sabase gambhir chunauti pesh kii he
 Saina says, "he (gopichand) knows how to train you, where you are weak and what you have to do to win the tournament
" ” isi main guru apni baat jodate hai, “pichley nau saal main mujhe har minute kii khabar rahi he ki vah kab or kya karti he
 You can say that i have monitored his actions with great vigor
 ”sina kii kamyaabi ne ek tarah kii kranti kaa kaam kiya
 Parents of children flocked to the academy
 gopi kaa to jaise naam hi ban gaya guru pulela ‘focus’ gopichand
 This focus is reflected when he flatly refuses to make any child who is a full-time scholar, who will be studying full-time as well as playing badminton, will go to the party at weekends, who will eat and eat in America
 Will celebrate holidays
 apane makasad ke prati unki vyaktigat nishtha main bhi vahi focus jhalkata he
 Gopichand is the first person to step into the academy at four in the morning at four in the morning and his day ends at seven in the evening
 39 saal kii umr main ve puri tarah feet hai
 They are also combative partners and keep an eye like an eagle on every player in each of the eight categories
 net smash kii practice kar rahe 20 khiladinnon ko sikhaate samay ve sakhti se aadesh dete haih “apane ghutane modo
 "from Saina, who is now 23 years old, to the academy's most junior player, everyone knows that every word coming out of Gopichand's mouth is law
 18 saal kii sindhu bataati hai, ‘ve jo bhi kehete hai, ham aankh mundakar uskaa paalan karte hai
 Sindhu has threatened the world of badminton by winning a bronze medal at the World Championships in Guangzhou in China this August
 abhi se sina ke saath unki tulana shuru ho gai he
 Gopichand makes it clear that it is unfair to compare Saina to Sindhu
 sina 16 pramukh antarrashtriya khitaab jeet chuki he
 “I do not want Saina vs Sindhu or Saina and Sindhu to have the same situation
 main to yahi chaahunga ki sina or sindhu vishwa str par saath-saath mukaable karne ke liye utren
 "the biggest advantage of being the current stars of Indian badminton and the best players of the next generation under one roof is that there is always an atmosphere of inspiration in the academy
 ubharate khiladinnon ko har samay apane aadarshon ko dekhne or unase seekhney kaa mauka miltaa he
 These new faces include 17-year-old Sayyam from Chhattisgarh
 gopichand ek hi court par sindhu or sayyam donon ko saath-saath sikhaate hai
 The challenge before Gopi now is to create such a group of gurus who can find and talent them even outside Hyderabad
 philhal is academy main kerala, madhya pradesh or chhattisgarh ke khilaadi hai
 In Europe academies have to pay 65 euros for every hour of practice but here in India, the best academy in India has a player for just Rs 2,000 a month
 detaa he
 5,000 every month staying in hostels
 dete hai
 Gopichand allows his players to jump higher only when a smash hit is required
 anyathaa har shishy ko jameen par tike rahane kaa gur ghutti main pilaayaa jaataa he
 So despite returning to Hyderabad late at night after a showdown in Guangzhou, Sindhu was present in the big court the next morning
 gopichand bhi vahaan maujuud the
 As if both of them have yet to complete an incomplete work
 jab ‘gopi sar’ court par hon to game jari hi samajhie

 This means that this is happening with the support of elements from across the border, but i am sure nothing happens without the support, cooperation and knowledge of the Pakistani Army
 yah hamaare liye chintaa kaa vishay he
 The defense minister wondered how such efforts could take place without the knowledge or support of Pakistan's armed forces, as the Indian Army and the Border Security Force on the one hand protect the international border and the Rangers on the other
 rakshaamantri ne kaha, seemaa ke donon ore sashastr balon kii purna paharedaari hoti he, isliye kaise aatankwaadi pakistan ke sashastr balon kii jaankaree yaa samarthan ke bina bhartiya seemaa main ghuspaith kar sakate hai? unhone kaha, yah ek sawaal he, jo hamen pareshaan kar rahaa he
 Antony said that India has been consistently saying that it is honest in improving relations with Pakistan, but the question is, when it is intruding, how can it be possible? film industry ke handsam hank karthik aryan (kartik Aaryan) yun to sara ali khan (sara Ali Khan) ke saath apni relationships ko lekar charchaa main rahete hai

 police kii poochtacha ke dauraan khulaasa hua ki uske nishane par kul saat bacchiyaan thim or ye sab usne ek tantric ke kehane par kiya
 This was revealed when a mob named Lalua Valmiki was beaten to death by a mob on Thursday on charges of raping and killing 12-year-old Kebchi

 In the SN Hospital in Agra, Ilajrat Sonu made several shocking revelations in the police interrogation
 usne bataaya ki dost lalua ke saath milakar usne chaar naaballig ladakiyon kii hatya kii sajeesh rachi
 Sonu said that the first murder was in 2010 when a 14-year-old girl came from another village to attend a family function
 duusari hatya saal 2012 main chaar saal kii bacchee kii hui
 At the same time, the third girl murdered was 9 years old
 lekan jab lalua or sonu ne chauthi hatya kii tab bheed ne police stesan se khinchakar ek ko maar daalaa, duusare ko adhamra kar diya
 Sonu also told the police that she did not kill herself but Lalua did the girls Karep

 Kumar taunted that Najeeb Jung's tenure was not memorable but we wish him all the best and hope that the central government will reward him for his service and he will definitely get a democratic estate
 udhar congress netaa or rajyasabha ke sadsy rah chuke jepi agarwal ne enditivi se kaha ki najeeb jang ko dilli waalon ke haq main kaam karnaa chahie tha jo unhone nahin kiya
 Constitutionally, the status he got, there were many subjects in which he could take tough decisions but he did not take them
 gauratlab he ki najeeb jang kii niyukti congress ke kaarykaal ke dauraan hui thi lekin iske baavjood unka jhukaav bijepi kii ore dekha gaya
 On this, Agarwal said that it depends on the person sitting on that post whether he wants to work impartially or not
 jang ko bijepi ke mutabik kaam karnaa munasib laga so unhone kiya
 The comments vahiin alji najeeb jang ke kaarykaal ko lekar bhi sawaal uth rahe the lekin grahamantralay ne saaf kiya he ki alji ke kaarykaal kaa samay tay nahin hota he
 Tejinder Khanna has the longest tenure as LG in Delhi so far, while most lgs have worked less than three years on average
 jahaan tak najeeb jang kaa sawaal he to vah july 2013 main dilli ke alji bane the or unhone is pad par bane teen saal chah maheene ho gaye the
 The Ministry of Home Affairs has made it clear that Najeeb Jung has resigned on his own terms
 najeeb jang ke istife ke baad dilli ke up-rajyapal ke liye 1969 batch ke IAS anil baijal kaa naam sabase aage chal rahaa tha, lekin is res main ek or naam jud gaya he ke je alfons kaa
 There has also been a meeting between the PM and the Home Minister last night regarding which name will be stamped
 dilli main bhale hi chuni hui sarkaar ho, lekin prashasnic kaman alji ke haath main rahati he
 In such a situation, this position becomes very important
 anil baijal vaajapeyi sarkaar main grih sachiv rahe hai
 DDA has been the Vice Chairman of Delhi
 iske alaava prasar bharti main siio bhi rahe hai
 On the other hand, Congress leader and Rajya Sabha member JP Aggarwal told NDTV that Najeeb Jung should have acted in favor of Delhi people which he did not do
 sanvaidhanik taur par unhen jo darja mila hua tha, us lihaaz se aise kai vishay the jisamen vah kade faisle le sakate the lekin unhone nahin liye
 Significantly, Najeeb Jung was appointed during the tenure of Congress but despite this his inclination was seen towards BJP
 is par agarwal ne kaha ki yah to us post par baithe vyakti par nirbhar karata he ki vah nishpakshta se kaam karnaa chahta he yaa nahin
 Jung found it appropriate to work according to the BJP, so he did
 tippaniyan At the same time, questions were also being raised about the tenure of LG Najeeb Jung, but the Home Ministry has made it clear that the time of lg's tenure is not fixed
 dilli main abhi tak bataur alji sabase lanbaa kaarykaal tejinder khanna kaa rahaa he, vahiin zyaadaatar alji ne ausatan teen saal se kam hi kaam kiya he
 As far as Najeeb Jung is concerned, he became the LG of Delhi in July 2013 and he had been in the post for three years and six months
 grahamantralay ne saaf kiya he ki najeeb jang ne apni marji se istipha diya he
 After the resignation of Najeeb Jung, the 1969 batch IAS Anil Baijal was the frontrunner for the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi, but another name has been added to the race that of j Alphons
 kis naam par muhar lagegi ise lekar beeti raat piem or grih mantri ke bich mulaaqaat bhi hui he
 Delhi may have an elected government, but the administrative command remains in the hands of LG
 aise main yah pad behad ahm ho jaataa he
 Anil Baijal has been the Home Secretary in the Vajpayee government
 dilli main didie ke vaais chayaraman rah chuke hai
 Apart from this, Prasar Bharati has also been CEO

 Akhilesh could not give any challenge to the politics of Kadam Gandhi, kept in politics in the 90s, political politics of bullying, politics and domination in Haramarai Bareilly, Akhilesh Singh, who has been a bad king for the last three decades, made every kind of wave, stakes and politics Proved himself to be a dwarf
 mangalvaar kii subah akhilesh singh kaa lakhanu ke pijiai main nidhan ho gaya
 He was suffering from cancer for a long time
 bataa den ki ek samay tha jab garib aadmi ko akhilesh singh se panaah main raham or raahat milti dikhti thi to duusari taraf shahar ke sabhy, shikshit or paise vaale is naam se khauf khate the
 He considered Subhash Chandra Bose as his ideal
 ye maanate the ki subhash chandra bose kii maut vimaan durghatana main nahin hui thi vah ab bhi jinda hai
 For this, he raised his voice in the assembly
 subah hote hi log unke paas madad ke liye pahunchane lagate the, akhilesh singh khule dil se sabaki madad karte the
 Akhilesh Singh does not lag behind helping the poor not only in his constituency but also in other areas of Rae Bareli
 isi ke chalate puure raibareli main untii tuuti bolti thi
 In the politics of Akhilesh Singh, many people who tried to break into the names were buried in history
 akhilesh singh ne paisa, takat or raajnneeti ko apana gulam banaakar rakhaa
 This is the reason why the Gandhi family also could not beat the politics of Akhilesh Singh in Rae Bareli
 akhilesh ko nahin de sakaa koi chunautiuttar pradesh kii siyasat main ramajanm bhoomi andolan kaa daur rahaa ho yaa raibareli main gandhi parivaar kii lahar yaa phir samaajwaad or bahujan hitay ke naaron kaa, akhilesh singh sirf apane dam par ek lambey arase se sadar vidhayak rahe
 Not only this, when the lotus was blooming in the Modi wave from the country to the state, then in Rae Bareli, Akhilesh Singh demolished the whole equation by putting his daughter Aditi Singh in the electoral fray and sent the assembly with record votes
 90 ke dashak main siyasat main rakhaa kadankhilesh singh ne 90 ke dashak main apana siyaasi safar congress se shuru kiya tha
 He was an MLA from Rae Bareli Sadar seat for nearly 24 years
 congress main rahete hue bhi akhilesh ne sabhi diggaj netaaon ko apane se bouna rakhaa
 Akhilesh Singh stayed away from the Congress for 13 years
 is dauraan vah gandhi parivaar ko jamkar koste the
 In 1999, when Captain Satish Sharma came to contest from Rae Bareli seat, Akhilesh Singh was sleepy due to his opposition

 In 2004, when Priyanka Gandhi passed through Akhilesh Singh's area for her mother Sonia Gandhi's election campaign, the roads were deserted and there was no visible distance
 iske baad priyanka gandhi ne raibareli main deraa jamaa diya tha, jiske baad kahin jaakar sonia jeet pain
 Akhilesh Singh's fear was that the Congressmen could not even put up posters for fear of him
 raibareli kii sadar seat se akhilesh singh ko maat dene ke liye gandhi parivaar ne kai moharon kaa istemaal kiya, lekin ek bhi kaamyaab nahin rahaa
 Congress leaders used power and money to defeat Akhilesh, but Akhilesh Singh won the election as an independent candidate even while in jail
 kshetra main gahari paithrybareli kii siyasat main akhilesh kii jaden itani jam chuki thim ki virodhiyon ke liye unhen ukhaadnaa aasaan nahin rahaa tha
 He was known as a Bahubali leader
 aparaadh kii duniya main unka naam tab aayaa jab 1985 main anand mishra kii hatya hui
 He was also named in the 1987 murder of Manoj Trivedi alias Badshah
 is ghatana ke baad se to puure jile par unka ecchhatra raaj kaayam ho gaya
 Whoever tried to raise his head in the district was made history
 23 july, 1988 ko batminton khilaadi saiyad modi kii hatya hui
 Akhilesh Singh's name was also mentioned in this murder case, but after this incident, he also started speaking outside the district
 haalanki jaisaa ki hota aayaa he, majboot se majboot ispaat ke khambhe ko bhi ek umr ke baad jang khaane lagata he akhilesh singh kaa bhi haal kuch aisa hi ho gaya tha
 He was suffering from cancer for a long time, due to which his political domination was also reduced

 One day when the king was sitting in his meeting, Maharishi Narada descended from the sky route and came to his meeting
 raja unhen dekhte hi haath jodakar khadaa ho gaya or unka pujan kiya
 He asked Devarshi Narada the reason for his arrival
 tab naarad muni ne kaha ki- he rajan! aap mere vachanon ko dhyaan se suno
 i once went from Brahmalok to Yamlok, where i reverently worshiped Dharmasheel and Satyavan Dharmaraja, worshiped by Yamraj
 usee yamraj kii sabha main mahaan gyani or dharmatma tumhaare pita koekadashi kaa vratabhang hone ke kaaran dekha
 He gave the message, i tell you
 unhone kaha ki purv janm main koi vighn ho jane ke kaaran main yamraj ke nikat rah rahaa hum
 Therefore, o son, if you fast for Ashwin Krishna Indira Ekadashi for me, i can get heaven
 naradji kii baat sunakar raja ne apane baandhvon tathaa daason sahit vrath kiya, jiske punya prabhaav se raja ke pita garud par chadhakar vishnulok ko gaye
 King Indrasen also ruled the kingdom with the effect of fasting on Ekadashi and finally went to heaven with his son sitting on the throne
 kya he is vrath kii vidhi- padam puraana ke anusaar ekadshi vrath ke niyamon kaa paalan dashami tithi se kiya jaataa he, jisamen ek baar bhojan, brahmacharya kaa paalan karnaa hota he

 - The food given to the fathers should be fed to the cow
 phir dhoop, phool, mithai, fal aadi se bhagwaan vishnu kaa pujan karne kaa vidhaan he

 TRAILER 11th June Ko 😎📹📸A post shared bydiljit Dosanjh (@diljitdosanjh) onjun 1, 2018 at 9:43 am PDT rus ne internet par bal pornography ke khilaaf chalaae ja rahe ek abhiyaan main 50 se zyada deshon kii police ko jode jane kii maang kii he
 According to sources, the Ministry of Internal Affairs made this demand on Tuesday
 aantarik maamalon ke mantri vladimir colocoltsev ne 'blike si iconomik ko-oparation' (bisiisi) kii baithak main shuukravaar ko kaha ki 'oparation sorneyak' kaa lakshya us vyakti ke bare main jaankaree ikkattha karnaa he jo bal pornography kii saamagree kaa prasar internet par kar rahaa he
 He said, "criminal activities on the Internet have increased and moral and material losses from such crime have increased
 ham aae din desh se baahar ke aparaadhik sanghathanon kii gatividhiyon kaa saamana karte hai
 According to the minister, 1,500 consumers from 64 countries have been caught in the crime of spreading pornography content on the Internet
 andhra pradesh ko vishesh rajya kaa darja dene se inkaar karte hue vitt mantri arun jetali ne kaha ki andhra pradesh ko special states ke aadhaar par hi special package diya jayega
 Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said that the main thing about giving special status to Andhra Pradesh is why special status is given to a state? Jaitley said that according to the Finance Commission, there is a provision of special status only for the states of north-east as they have very limited resources of their own
 jetali ne kaha ki kendra sarkaar deshbhar main kai skim kaa sanchaalan karti he
 Generally, both the Center and the State have to invest their funds on these schemes of the Center
 jahaan aam sthiti main kendra ko 60 fisadi kharch uthaane kaa praavdhaan he vahiin rajyon ko 40 fisadi kharch uthaanaa padataa he
 Now there is no provision of special status for the states, so this provision is only for the North East where the central government bears 90 percent of the expenditure for the central scheme and only 10 percent of the state government has to spend
 ise padhein: andhra pradesh kar rahaa jis vishesh shrenee kii maang, jaane kya hai iske phaaydagauratlab he ki jetali ne kaha ki chaudaaven vitt ayog ne rajyon ke liye special states ke praavdhaan ko hataa diya
 Hence, Andhra cannot be given special status status on this basis
 lihaaja kendra sarkaar or rajya sarkaar ne faisla kiya ki 5 saal tak 90-10 fisadi ke formule ke aadhaar par andhra pradesh ko special package diya jayega
 But Andhra can no longer be granted special status
 vahiin andhra sarkaar ke rukh par jetali ne kaha ki raajnneetik aadhaar par kisi rajya ko fund nahin diya ja saktaa he kyonki kendra sarkaar ko anya rajyon kii maang ko bhi dekhnaa he
 Significantly, the TDP government of Andhra Pradesh has asked to come out of the NDA alliance in the event of not being granted special status

 Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav is ready to try all the tricks to deal with the atmosphere created by one after another riots in Uttar Pradesh against the Samajwadi Party (SP) government of the state
 ab vah muslim mahilaon ko sarkaar kii ore se banti jane vaali free sadiiyon kii jagah salwar suut dene kii taiyaari kar rahe hai
 The Chief Minister was given this advice by a group of Muslim leaders from Amroha last week
 is bare main mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav kaa sakaaratmak rukh dekhakar panchayat raaj vibhaag garib muslim mahilaon ko salwar suut dene ke liye sarkari kaagajon ko phir se taiyaar karne main jute gaya he
 Read: Akhileshpa had promised to give two saris to poor women for free in a year in his election manifesto, which was supposed to heal the riots after first distributing free saris
 sarkaar banane ke baad panchayat raaj vibhaag ko hi free sari baantne kaa jimmaa saunpa gaya he
 After making a provision of Rs 800 crore in this year's budget, the Panchayati Raj Department has started finalizing the plan to give free saris to poor women
 225 rupee kaa hoga sootis vibhaag ke ek bade adhikari bataate hai ki garib mahilaon ko banti jane vaali free sari kii keemat 225 rupye tay kii gai he
 Now a provision will be made to give salwar suits of this price to poor Muslim women for free
 haalanki sarkaar ke liye salwar suut baantnaa itnaa aasaan nahin hoga
 But how will we manage the measurement? The biggest problem will be the measurement
 kis naap kaa salwar suut mahilaon ko baanta jayega
 Panchayati Raj Department officials are also considering a scheme to give free salwar suit cloth to poor Muslim women, which the beneficiary women will be able to sew according to their size but who will pay for the sewage? Departmental officers are not thinking of any solution on this
 haalanki vibhageeya adhikariyon ke muslim mahilaon ko free salwar suut dene ke nirnay ke baad is puri yojana ke praaroop ko nae sire se taiyaar karnaa hoga
 There is also a possibility that instead of giving free sari or salwar suit, 225 rupees fixed for it should be distributed to the poor women from whom they can buy the saree or salwar suit of their choice

 maano kal kii hi to baat he ki mejabaan brazil ne vishwa cap ke shuruaati match main kroeshia ko buree tarah se haraaya tha or ab germany ke haathon nihaayat sharmnaak shikast khaakar nistej ho gaya
 In that first match, while Brazil's barrels were beating themselves up after beating a mediocre team, in front of Germany's throngs, they looked like trees, which were crushing them like thunderstorms

 donon hi is spardhaa ko jeetne kii kshamta rakhte hai
 i am the person who has watched all the matches, whether they are the matches being played at the same time in the final round of the group stage - one on his laptop and the other on TV
 main pathakon ko kuch baaten bataanaa chahta hum jinamein se chand mere bete ke nazariye se kaaphi prabhavit hai jiske saath maine match dekhe or jo apni 14 saal kii umr main footbal ke bare main sambhavat: kuch zyada hi jaankaree rakhata he
 Let's start with two things: first, the end of an era for Spain; Second, the end of Brazilian magic
 footbal kii duniya main spain ke varchasv kii avadhi choti rahi or khel ke lambey itihaas main kaaphi der se ai thi
 This was the time of the year 2008–14 during which a World Cup was held (in 2010 in South Africa) in addition to two European Championships
 jab duniya main spain kii tuuti bol rahi thi, europea club str par barsilona kaa jalawaa tha
 Barcelona's threat was such that Newsweek raised a question in the June 2011 issue of whether it was the best team yet
 (this article was written by Jimmy Bunners, a Barcelona football historian
 isliye unke sawaal kaa sahaj jawaab 'haa’ hi tha
 ) On the second day of this World Cup, on 13 June, Spain's dominance ended with a 5–1 defeat to Holland
 score vishaal tha or mahasoos hua ki hamane ek mahabali ko peedi ke sabase kade mukaable main duusare se post hote dekha (tab yah andaja nahin tha ki aane vaale pehle semi final main ek haroonges ghatana hamaara intjaar kar rahi he)
 Spain also lost to Chile in the second match and after two matches, the last time world winner was bowing out of competition
 yah koi aam paraajay nahin thi
 It was the end of a round
 pichhali baar barsilona ne apni chamak ganvaai thi or is baar catalan club se liye khiladinnon or usee ke gur se sadhe andaaj par khilne ke baavjood spain buree tarah parajeet hua
 i have no hope of reaching the pinnacle of football back in Spain
 spain ke dhul-dhoosarit hone se bhi badtar patan brazil kaa hua, kuch aisa ki aane vaale kai saal tak footbal ke maidan par brazil ko haraane ke baad bhi koi team khud ko gauravanvit nahin mahasoos kar paaegi
 The invincible fort collapsed and the ink on the emperor's aura is restored
 shaayad brazil ke vishwa cap kii niyati yahi thi
 But the imagination of the Brazilians had set the tone of the law differently that they would host a spectacular tournament, which culminated in Rio's Maracana Stadium with an unbeaten display of scores and goals of the game and their captain Thiago Silva's trophy It will take place on a full night with a raised hand
 khel ke tatasth darshakon or nishpaksh prashansakon ko shuru se hi lag rahaa tha ki is ibaarat main sab gaddamdd hone vaala he
 Brazil had defeated Croatia, but it featured the role of the Japanese referee darting towards them, with Mexico only running for 90 minutes and not scoring a goal
 pre quarter daur main jab isane saahsee chile ko shikast di to uske peeche penlti shoot out kii bhoomika rahi vah bhi tab jabaki chile use kadam-dar-kadam barabari kii takkar de rahaa tha
 As if the planets had a bad eye in the quarter-finals against Colombia
 brazil ke sabase achche khilaadi nemaar ko is barbar match main virdohi team ne chotil kar diya jisamen brazil josh bhare cofirs (colombia kii footbal team ke liye pukaar kaa naam) ko haraane ke liye qamar kas kar khadaa tha
 Neymar was forced to pull out of the semi-finals due to a broken spine and captain Silva's numerous yellow cards
 gol daagne vaale nemaar or majboot dephender silva ke bagaiyr brazil germany ko kaise haraa saktaa tha? brazil main kisi kaa dhyaan is taraf nahin gaya, na hi kisi ne koshish kii
 Prior to the match with Germany, everyone's focus was on Neymar and the emotions were overflowing
 desh ghayal nemaar ke liye chintit ho uthaa
 The foul Colombian defender was being cursed as a coward
 biimaar nemaar ke liye faile rashtravyapee matam main kisi ne germany ke saath hone vaale khel ko jeetne kii ranneeti tay karne par dhyaan nahin diya or us raat ke khel main yahi sabase bada dosha dikhaa
 Brazilian coach Louis Felipe Scolari will have to bear more responsibility for this mistake
 unke pasandida khiladinnon se bani is team main unke shagird ek ausat darje kii ghatiya team kii tarah khele
 Fred, who played on the front, marched the entire country
 unke paas na takanic thi, na buddhi, na hunar, na hi kaushal
 Nevertheless they were included in every game and were never removed
 fred brazil kii pichley vishwa cap tiimon ke kisi bhi khilaadi ke pair kii dhul ke baraabar bhi nahin
 His presence in this team was a proof of the team's weakness and powerlessness
 quarter or semi final main dikh chukaa tha ki vishwa main footbal kii mahashaktiyaan europe or latin america (or khaskar spain, germany, france, holland or england kii neshnal lig) hai
 The United States showed courage in reaching the last 16, and Costa Rica's skill and maturity in making the jump to the quarter-finals also showed great, but the World Cup is the competition of established power centers
 main or mere bete ne udghaatan match ke kai din pehle vishwa cap kii fehrist par gaur kar quarter final main pahunchane vaali sambhavit tiimon kii bhavishyavaanee kii thi
 Our assessment was correct except for one: we chose Italy rather than Costa Rica
 semi final main vahi timen pahunchin jo lagaataar acha karti rahi hai: germany (teen baar vijeta) banaam brazil (paanch baar vijeta); argentina (do baar vijeta) banaam netherland (teen baar final tak pahunchaa)
 These teams, along with Italy, are a permanent part of the group of football's 'superpowers'
 lekin kisi ko fark nahin padataa
 There is no noise about the representation of such teams from other countries
 aakhir kyon ho? asia or africa kii tiimon ko is vishwa cap main apane hisse kaa vahi anand mila he jo unhen zyaadaatar vishwa cap spardhaon main miltaa he; par ve sirf romaanchak pal hi nahin the, ye aisi kshanbhangur yaaden thim jinamein abhaagi team 'mahashaktiyon’ ke saamne ghutane techne ke pehle sammaan bhare chand palon ko samet lenaa chaahati he
 The countdown to the finals has begun
 argentina teesri baar germany ke saath vishwa cap ke final mukaable main pahunchaa he
 Those who want to say that Germany should win, i will warn them with one word: Messi
 unhone bahut acha pradarshan kiya he or hamen shandaar golon ke jalwe dikhaae
 Initially, their performance was affected due to the lack of team support, but they have the ability to reverse the game
 argentina kii team belgium ke khilaaf quarter final match se lay main ai
 But in the semi-final match, Argentina missed their rivals, Angel de Maria
 di maaria behad chatur or aakarshak khilaadi hai or yadi ve final tak apni chot se ubar gaye to aasamaani neeli or safed jersey vaali yah dakshin america team germany ko jabardast takkar dene kii sthiti main hogi
 Argentina's defense is the raid
 semi final main holland or uske pehle duusare tiimon ne bhi iskaa ehsaas kiya he
 Their defense line is such that there is no chance for Arjen Robben, Wesley Snyder and Robben van Persie, despite their considerable success
 kisi or team ke liye robin jaise khilaadi ko is tarah nazarandaaj karne kii baat kalpana se bhi pare he
 Robben gets a chance to hit the goal post by going somewhere in the 9th minute of extra time in the 99th minute of the match
 duusari ore, germany kii apni khaasiyaten hai or yah team is vishwa cap kii sabase mukammal team he
 Thomas Müller and Miroslav Kloss attack like a leopard, with mid-fielder Sami Khederia not responding and Philip Lam getting the right-back in his natural place
 is team main group maichon ke dauraan ek tarah kii susti chai hui thi jab coach joakim lo ne lam ko mid field main hi banaae rakhane kaa ajeebogareeb faisla kar rakhaa tha
 i would like to conclude this article with a prayer — have a nice June 13 night for the referee
 vah nyaay kar paae
 He will be able to leave the game
 girte khiladinnon or unke tikadamon ke jhaanse main na aae, khaas taur par penalty box main
 Even after deliberately acting against foul players, they do not have to remove cards from their pockets quickly

 If they are equally clean, then answer these allegations in public domain in a point-wise manner

 gat champion vidarbha ke 200 ranon tak saat wicket jhatak liye
 The toss proved to be good for Saurashtra, who managed to get the wickets of Vidarbha's most important batsman Jaffer (23) and captain Faiz Fazal (16) cheaply
 saurashtra ke gendbaajon visheshkar unadakat (20 ran dekar 2 wicket) or unke tej gendbaaj jodidar chetan sakaaria (13 ran dekar 1 wicket) ne kasi gendbaaji kar vipakshi ballebaajon ko pareshaan rakhaa
 Unadkat was perfectly accurate in his line and length, while Sakaria kept the batsmen in trouble by swinging the ball and moving
 gat champion team saajhedaari hasil karne main juujhati dikhi or agar akshay wadkar (45) or akshay karnevar (naabad 31 ran) ke bich saatven wicket ke liye 57 ranon kii saajheedaari nahin hoti, to ve or mushkil main hote
