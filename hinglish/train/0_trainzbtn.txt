 Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray has advised his party leader Manohar Joshi to remind him of Geeta, that he should keep doing karma, not wishing for the fruit
 maharashtra ke purv mukhyamantri or purv loksabhaa spikar manohar joshi ne ek kaarykram ke dauraan kaha tha ki uddhav thakare or manase pramukh raaj thakare ko ek ho janaa chahie

 After this, it has been the first reaction from Uddhav
 uddhav ne 'saamana' main apane lekh main yah baat kahi

 ( input bhashaa se) It was a historic hearing in the Supreme Court on the Ram temple
 desh kii sabase badi adaalat main sambandhit pakshakaron ne ayodhya cese main madhyasthon ke naam likh kar de die hai
 This morning the court asked the parties to name the arbitrators
 hindu mahasabha ne purv sijeai deepak mishra, purv sijeai jees khehar or supreme court ke purv jaj eke patnayak ke naam madhyasthata ke liye die hai
 The General Assembly is ready for mutual talks
 sijeai ke khilaaf press conference karne vaale chaar jajon main justise courian joseph bhi shaamil the
 Before retiring, he targeted the government several times
 justise courian ne jajon kii niyukti main deree par bhi sarkaar ko lapeta tha
 Nirmohi Akhara has also given three names for arbitration
 inamen supreme court ke ritred jaj courian joseph, eke patnayak or jies singhvi shaamil hai
 At the same time, retired judge Anil Dave can be named on behalf of Hindu petitioners
 ahm baat ye bhi he ki supreme court ne mana he ki ye sirf jameen vivaad nahin he, balki logon kii bhaawanaaon se judaa mudda he
 The Supreme Court wants the Ayodhya dispute to be resolved only through negotiation, but whether this will be possible, there are doubts about it
 ayodhya vivaad par pehle bhi kai baar madhyasthata kii koshishen ho chuki hai, lekin har baar nateeja nahin niklaa
 This time the Supreme Court has taken command, it is expected that the way to Ayodhya will come out through mediation
 desh kii sabase badi adaalat ye chaahati he ayodhya cese kaa hal baatcheet se nikle
 Today, the Supreme Court held a long hearing in the Ayodhya case
 is dauraan ye badi baaten raheen-pehali badi batsupreme court chahta he ki cese kaa hal baatcheet se nikle, isliye court ne aaj hi pakshakaron se naam maange hai
 The court had set the time for the nomination till four o'clock
 duusari badi baatcheef justise ranjan gogoi ne kaha ki ham jald is maamle par faisla dena chaahate hai
 It is believed that the decision on arbitration will come in two to three days
 teesri badi baatbabari masjid pakshakaar kii taraf se madhyasthata kaa virodh nahin kiya gaya, jabaki hindu mahasabha, nirmohi akhaada or ram lalaa paksh kii ore se madhyasthata kaa virodh kiya gaya
 What happened during the hearing in the court today, now let you tell you - The Hindu Mahasabha made its stand as soon as the court hearing began
 hindu mahasabha kii ore se kaha gaya ki bhale hi pakshakaar madhyasthata ke liye maan jaae, lekin logon ko ye manjuur nahin hoga
 The Hindu Mahasabha argued that public notice would have to be taken out for arbitration
 is tarah is prakriya main saalon lag jaaenge
 On this, Justice Bhushan said that what is the need of public notice for this
 sunwaayee ke dauraan justise es e bobade ne kaha ki ye sirf jameen kaa maamla nahin he, balki bhaawanaaon se judaa maamla bhi he
 That is why the court wants a solution out of mutual negotiations
 justise es e bobade ne isse aage badhate hue kaha ki ham babar kii ghuspaith ko to nahin badal sake, lekin ham maujuuda halaat ko dekh sakate hai
 What Hindu Mahasabha said: Hindu Mahasabha said that Hindus are not ready to mediate, because this is the land of their God
 wo ise jane nahin de sakate
 Justice Bobde said that this is your side
 aap madhyasthata shuru karne se pehle hi isaki asafalataa maan rahe hai
 this is not right
 ham kisi ko kuch chhodane ke liye nahin kah rahe
 We understand the impact of this dispute and its political impact on the country
 justise bobade ne kaha ki madhyasthata ko gopneey rakhaa janaa chahie
 On what the Babri Masjid party said, it was said by the Babri Masjid party that an order has to be passed so that no talk about arbitration comes out
 saath hi sunni vakf board ke vakil rajeev dhawan kii taraf se ye bhi kaha gaya ki madhyasthata ke liye sabhi partiyon kii sahmati jaruri nahin he
 What Justice Chandrachud said Justice Chandrachud said that this dispute is not just between two parties, but between two communities
 muslim pakshakaron kii tarah se kaha gaya ki madhyasthata kaa suzav court kii taraf se aayaa he
 The court has to decide how the negotiations will take place
 muslim pakshakaar or nirmohi akhaada baatcheet ke paksh main he, lekin sahmati kaise banegi, sunwaayee ke dauraan maujuud subramanmay swami ne kaha jameen ko lekar koi samjhauta nahin ho saktaa
 It can only be said that compensation should be given to the land that has been taken
 ram lalaa pakshakaar kii ore se kaha gaya ki ayodhya ram janm bhoomi he
 There can be no agreement on this
 nirmohi akhaada ne kya kahanirmohi akhaada pakshakaar kii ore se kaha gaya ki jameen par hamaara adhikaar he
 We have the right to worship
 sabhi daleelon ko sunne ke baad supreme court ne faisla philhal surakshit rakh liya he

 ek taaja adhyayan main khulaasa hua he ki dhumrapaan karne vaale 60 fisadi log matdaan main hissaa nahin lete, jisase aise logon ke haashiye par jane vaali dharna ko bal mila he
 According to the study's author and assistant professor at the University of Colorado, Karen Elbright, 'through earlier studies we know that people who smoke or consume tobacco are increasingly marginalized and are less involved in organizational and other activities Occur
 iske alaava dhumrapan na karne vaale logon kii apeksha aise logon main aatmavishvaas bhi kam hota he
 ' elbrit ne kaha, 'lekin hamaare shodh main saamne aayaa he ki haashiye par jane kii yah sthiti vaiyaktik str se kahin adhik badi he tathaa raajnneetik pranali or raajnneetik sansthaanon se bhi ve dur ja rahe hai
 ' yah adhyayan phone par kareeb 11,626 logon se baatcheet ke jariye kiya gaya
 People were asked demographic, social and practical questions
 surveykshan main pratibhaagiyon se puche gaye sawaal main dhumrapaan se jude vyavhaar ke bare main bhi sawaal tha or unase yah bhi poocha gaya ki kya unhone haal main hue matdaan main hissaa liya tha
 The comments anusandhankartaaon ne paaya ki pratidin dhumrapaan karne vaale 60 fisadi pratibhaagiyon ne dhumrapaan na karne waalon kii apeksha matdaan main hissaa nahin liya
 However, the study has not clarified why people who smoke have this disinterest in voting? iske peeche ek vajah yah ho sakati he ki dhumrapaan karne vaale log tambaakoo par tamaam tarah ke kar lagane or anya pratibandhon ke kaaran raajnneetik sansthaaon ko damankaaree ke rup main dekhte hon
 The study has been published in the latest issue of the research journal 'nicotine and Tobacco'
 adhyayan ke lekhak evam colorado vishvavidhyalay main sahaayak praadhyaapak karen elbrit ke anusaar, 'isse pehle hue adhyayanon ke jariye hamen pataa he ki dhumrapaan yaa tambaakoo kaa seven karne vaale log teji se haashiye par ja rahe hai tathaa ve santhnik evam anya gatividhiyon main kam hi shaamil hote hai
 Apart from this, such people are also less confident than those who do not smoke
 ' Elbright said, "but our research has shown that this marginalized situation is much larger than the individual level and they are moving away from the political system and political institutions as well
" ' The study was conducted through a conversation with about 11,626 people over the phone
 logon se janasankhyikee, saamaajik evam vyaavhaarik sawaal puche gaye
 The question asked of the survey participants was also about the behavior related to smoking and they were also asked whether they had participated in the recent polling
 tippaniyan Researchers found that 60 percent of smokers per day did not participate in voting, compared to non-smokers
 haalanki adhyayan main yah spasht nahin kiya gaya he ki dhumrapaan karne vaale logon main matdaan ko lekar yah aruchi kyon hoti he? One reason for this may be that smokers view political institutions as oppressive due to all kinds of taxes on tobacco and other restrictions

 ab rani mukherjee kii film ko lekar bollywood ke mistar parfectionist aamir khan (aamir Khan) ne ek twit kiya he, jo soshal media par khub viral ho rahaa he
 Rani !!! Hearing great things about Mardaani 2! Can't wait to see it
 Congratulations and all the very best! Love a
 Aamir Khan wrote from his Twitter handle about Rani Mukherjee's film 'mardaani 2', "rani !!! i am listening very well to 'mardaani 2'
 film ko dekhne kaa or intjaar nahin kar saktaa
 Best wishes 
 
 " aamir khan ke is twit par log khub coment kar rahe hai or apni pratikriya bhi de rahe hai
 Panipat Box Office Collection Day 9: Arjun Kapoor's film exploded on day 9 Which brings young girls to their target in the city, it has been said that it is inspired by the true incident
 rani mukherjee (rani Mukherjee) film main police afasar shivani roy kii apni bhoomika ko doharaa rahi hai, jo us apradhi ko do dinon main pakadaney kii baat thaan leti hai
 Well, there is no harm in Aamir Khan's ability! We all know how much life he can burn in that dialogue
 lekin baavjood iske kuch to aisa bhi he jahaan vah bhatak jate hai, atak jate hai yaa phir yun kahie ki yahi atakana-bhatakana hi seen kii jarurat ho jaataa hoga! ham baat kar rahe hai, us aid kii, jisamen aamir khan king khan ke fesus doylog ko bolte hai
 But this dialogue worked for Shahrukh in the film but it did not work for Aamir
 
 
 film 'dilavaale dulhaniya le jaaenge' main shahrukh khan stesan par ek doylog he jise vah dur jaati hui kaajol ko dekhakar bolte hai- palat palat palat
 
 
 And Kajol turns around and sees
 
 Not only in this film but in the same way, the charisma of this dialogue was very popular
 
 Even after 20 years, this dialogue is life-threatening
 
 The comments shahrukh ke is doylog kaa asar bhi hota he lekin jab is doylog ko aamir ek vigyaapan main bolte hai to kuch nahin hota
 
 
 
 ab aamir ne yah doylog kyon bolaa
 
 kab bolaa or iskaa vahi asar kyon nahin jaisaa ki shahrukh ke cese main hua tha yah jaanane ke liye to aapako yah video dekhnaa hoga
 
 
 The film 'dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge' has a dialogue at Shah Rukh Khan station which he speaks on seeing Kajol going away - in a hurry
 
 
 or kaajol palat kar dekh leti hai
 
 is film main hi nahin balki vaise bhi is doylog kaa karishma khub dhooma machaa gaya tha
 
 20 saal baad bhi yah doylog jaandaar he
 
 tippaniyan This dialogue of Shahrukh also has an effect, but when Aamir speaks this dialogue in an advertisement, nothing happens
 
 
 
 Now why did Aamir speak this dialogue
 
 When you spoke and why it did not have the same effect as it did in Shahrukh's case, then you have to watch this video

 An exciting match is expected between the two teams
 dairedevills ke liye yah match nau tiimon kii talika main sheersh par apana sthaan majboot karne kaa madhyam hoga jabaki plaof kii daud main bane rahane ke liye royal chalangers ko yah match har haal main jeetna hoga
 Royal Challengers have scored 15 points from 14 matches and are ranked fifth in the table
 guuruuvaar ko hi dharmashala main agar superkings kii kings ilevan punjab ke haathon haar milti he to chalangers kotla main dairedevills ko har haal main haraakar plaof kii daud main bane rahanaa chahega
 For this, he will have to improve his net runrate slightly
 royal chalangers ke liye dairedevills ko usee ke ghar main haraana aasaan kaam nahin hoga
 Daredevils, with their expert batsmen such as David Warner, Virender Sehwag, Ross Taylor, Mahela Jayawardene and Naman Ojha, can pose a big challenge to the challengers as well as overcome any of their challenges
 gendbaaji main haalanki dairedevills kaa palada chalangers se thodaa kamjor he lekin morne morkal ke rup main uske paas ek aisa gendbaaj he, jo kisi bhi pal khel kaa rukh badal saktaa he
 Royal Challengers also have great batsmen like Chris Gayle, Virat Kohli, Mayank Agarwal and Abraham de Villiers
 gendbaaji main chalangers ke paas jahir khan, aar vinay kumaar or muthaiya muralidharan anbhavi hai
 In such a situation, a strong fight can be expected between the Dabangs of Sehwag and the workers of Kohli in Kotla on Thursday

 Even the land-mafia dead in Madhya Pradesh did not desist from snatching their two yards of land
 taaja maamla gwalior ke upnagar muraar kaa he, jahaan ek shmashaan kii jameen par bhu-mafia ne kabja kar liya or us par bhukhand kaat kar bech die
 Of the eight bighas of cremation ground, five bighas are in illegal possession
 muraar ke jaderua kalam ilaake main aath bigha kshetra main bane shmashaan kaa istemaal sau saal se hota aayaa he
 Ever since Jaderua Kalan, a village, has come within the limits of the municipal corporation, the price of land here has increased wildly
 aise main bhu-mafia ko shmashaan kii jameen kabjana mufeed laga, jiskaa koi daavedaar saamne nahin aa saktaa tha
 Since the crematorium does not have a boundary wall, it started occupying it from all sides
 yahaan bhukhand kharidne vaale log jab jameen kii registry karwaane colectrate pahunche to yah jaanakar unke pairon tale se jameen khisak gai ki jahaan ve makaan banane kaa sapana dekh rahe the, vah to shmashaan kii jameen he
 Former councilor of the area Hariom Yadav complained to the administration about this, yet the action of the land mafia increased even more if no action was taken
 yadav bataate hai, ''sarkari dastavejon main teen survey number par kareeb aath bigha jameen shmashaan ke naam arakshit he
 The municipal corporation also built an overhead tank near this land, but did not build a boundary wall to protect the crematorium from illegal occupation
 ''yadav daawa karte hai ki paanch saal pehle shmashaan kii chahardivari banane ke liye unhone nagar nigam se 14 lakh ru
 Approved also, but due to the influence of the land mafia, the wall could not be built
 sthaneey logon ke dekhte hi dekhte shmashaan simatata gaya or isaki jameen par ghar khadey hote gaye
 Local resident Naresh Dandolia says, "there used to be 8 tin sheds for cremation at this crematorium, but now only two of these are left
 yahaan bacchon ke antim sanskaar ke liye bhi alag se jameen thi, lekin us jameen par bhi kabja ho chukaa he
 According to Hindu custom, the last rites of the children are performed by burying them
 aise main andaja mushkil nahin he ki jis jameen par atikaraman kar makaan banaae ja chuke hai, uske neeche kai logon ke kaleje ke tukade gahari neend soe hue hon
 When people arrived to get the registry of the plot built on the crematorium in their name, the administration lost sleep
 muraar ke esadm anuraag saxena kehete hai, ''pataa chalaa he ki shmashaan kii jameen par bhukhand kaate gaye hai
 Now we have demarcated this land
 hamaari jaankaree main yah baat bhi ai he ki kuch log sasti keemat ke bhukhand kaa laalach dekar janata ko gumraah kar rahe hai
 "administrative investigations have revealed that most of the plots have been sold by notary
 19 farvari ko prashasan ne shmashaan kii 3
 5 Bigha removed encroachment from the land but a person named Umaid Singh, who claimed ownership of the land, has given an application for re-planting of the land
 prashasan bhi phir se simakan ke liye taiyaar ho gaya he
 Here, victims who are trapped by purchasing the plot are not ready to come forward
 yahaan par bhukhand kharidne vaale ek vyakti kehete hai, ''rajasav mahakme kii naap-jokh par hamen zyada vishwaas nahin he
 The land is being demarcated by the same employees who have developed plots on the cremation ground along with the land mafia
 ''gwalior main shahar se sate tees gaanvon ko haal hi main nagar nigam seemaa main shaamil kiya gaya tha
 Due to which the land prices here have increased overnight
 jaderua kalam gaanv par bhu-mafia kii khaastaur se najar he kyonki is gaanv se mukhya maarg kii duuri mahaj ek kilometre he
 Those who have seen the cremation ground shrink, they fear that its existence will end soon
 england main chal rahe cricket world cap ke liye wicketiper ballebaaj rishabh pant ko england bula liya gaya he
 He has been called in as cover for injured opener Shikhar Dhawan
 hairaan karne vaali baat yah he ki shikhar dhawan ke world cap se puri tarah baahar nahin hone tak pant ko indian dressing room main jane kaa mauka nahin milegaa
 The world of cricket was divided into two sections after Pant was not found in Team India selected for the World Cup
 ek varg kaa kahana tha ki pant ko team main rakhana chahie tha, vahiin kuch diggaj khilaadiyon kaa maananaa tha ki chayankartaaon kaa faisla sahi he
 Pant will join the team in Manchester ahead of the high voltage match with Pakistan on 16 June
 england daure par aae bisisiai ke ek adhikari ne pitiai se kaha, 'team prabandhan ke aagrah par rishabh pant ko cover ke taur par bharat se bulaayaa gaya he
 "he will not be included as an option until the team management makes a final decision on Dhawan's availability in the rest of the tournament
" pant ne pichley ek saal main prabhaavshaalee pradarshan kiya
 He also scored centuries in Tests in England and Australia and was in good form during the IPL last month
 bisisiai sutron se pataa chalaa he ki 2015 vishwa cap main dhaval kulkarni kii tarah pant aupchaarik rup se team kaa hissaa nahin honge or match ke din unhen dressing room main jane kaa mauka nahin milegaa
 a source told PTI, 'he will arrive in Manchester ahead of the match against Pakistan
 isliye vah yahaan nahin aa paaenge lekin vah manchester main honge
 He will not be part of the team so Khalil will travel separately with Ahmed
 'unhone kaha, 'match ke din use dressing room main aane kaa mauka nahin milegaa
 According to the icc's anti-corruption rules, only selected players can travel with the team and go to the dressing room
 'sunil gavaskar sahit kai purv khilaadiyon ne dhawan ke feet nahin ho paane par unki jagah pant ko team main shaamil karne kii vakaalat kii thi
 Dhawan has been ruled out of 3 matches due to an injury to his left thumb
 vah australia ke khilaaf shatkeey pari ke dauraan chotil ho gaye the
 However, the team's fielding coach Sanjay Bangar said on Wednesday that Dhawan can return to the team in 10 to 12 days
 bharat ne buudhvaar ko kaha ki vah huji or alqaida ke farmaanon ke hisaab se nahin chalegaa or unke netaa eliyas kashmiri kii dhamkiyon se nahin digega
 Union Home Minister P
 chidambaram ne patrakaron se kaha, ‘eliyas kashmiri hamaari kaaryadisha tay nahin kar saktaa

 abhi har taraf admician kaa maahaul he
 People are running from one city to another for college admission

 Calcutta University is one of the well-known universities in the country
 yahaan desh bhar se students padhane ke liye aate hai
 north-east has the highest number of students
 jharkhand-bihar se bhi kai students apana sapana puraa karne yahaan aate hai
 New people come here to experience new experiences
 jab kisi duusare rajya kaa koi koi student yahaan pehali baar padhane aate he to use kuch is tarah kaa maahaul miltaa he
 (1) Language problem: Most of the students in the university are from Bengal, in which Bengali is the most spoken language here
 aisa nahin he ki yahaan calocal studentsko hindi nahin aati he lekin phir bhi bengali main hi baat karnaa unhen zyada bhaataa he
 In such a situation, when an outside student comes here, he feels like strangers
 use lagata he ki har koi use ignor kar rahaa he
 However, he slowly acquires a tantrum and then wants to stay there
 2) apane main hi mast rahete hai students:apni jindagi main khush rahanaa yahaan ke students kii khubi he lekin baahar se aae bacchon ke liye ye pareshaani kaa sabab ban jaati he
 In the new environment, there is a need for a partner who can help you in the new city
 lekin yahaan castudentuepane main hi itane mast hote hai ki baahar se aayaa koi shaks unase madad bhi nahin maang paata he
 3) Abundance of art lovers: Kolkata is known for its art culture
 yahaan ke logon ko sangeet se bahut pyaar hota he
 You will also get to listen to Ravindra music on campus
 aae-din yahaan compatishan hote rahete hai
 This can be a good platform for students from outside who are interested in folk dance and music
 4) kurte se pyaar:uniwarsity ke fishan kii baat kii jaae to yahaan castudents ko kurtepahananaa kuch zyada hi pasand he
 Kurta above and jeans below is street-smart fashion there
 yahaan ladkiyaan bhi purushon kii tarah lambey or deele kurte pahananaa pasand karti hai
 This can be a little awkward for students from outside and many people do not like this fashion
 kalakatta uniwarsity fishan sens ke maamle main dilli uniwarsity jitani hapening or advance nahin he
 5) Street Food: The city of Kolkata is very famous for its food
 uniwarsity ke jitne bhi college hai unke aas-paas dheron food jwoints or thele hai
 Here Phucke ie Golgappa is the first choice of the students
 agar aapane ek baar yahaan kii jhaal-moodi or aalu chaap kha liya to use aap bhul nahin paaenge
 There are also many sweet shops around the campus whose rasgulla and sandesh are famous all over the country
 baahar se aane vaale students ke liye yahaan kaa zaayakedaar khaanaa kisi tohfe se kam nahin
 The coffee house near the University of Calcutta is of the British era, people who drink coffee come from far and wide
 6) dada ke khilaaf kuch mat kahana:ji haa ! agar aap kalakatta uniwarsity main padhane aae hai to dada yani ki saurav ganguli ke bare main soch-samaj ke hi bolnaa
 If you say something against Dada, then you can also fight
 7) cricket ke saath-saath footbal bhi he pasand:nabbe ke dashak se jo bharat par cricket kii khumaari chadhi he wo yahaan bhi students par tari he lekin yahaan footbal ko bhi shiddat se follow kiya jaataa he
 After all, the best football clubs of the country like Mohan Bagan, etc
 are also the pride of Bengal

 robert wadra or dlef ke bich kii santhganth kaa pulinda lekar wo media ke saamne hajir hue
 All the evidence tried to prove that the Haryana government helped DLF get hundreds of acres of land at the cost of a lot of money and in return DLF benefited Robert Vadra immensely
 unhone yah bhi aarope lagaae ki haryana sarkaar ne dlef ko phayda pahunchane ke liye niyamon ko bhi taak par rakh diya
 Arvind Kejriwal said, 'DLF provided many benefits to Robert Vadra
 pichley press conference ke baad hamalogon se poocha gaya ki haryana sarkaar ne kis tarah se dlef ko phayda pahunchaaya
 We are not an investigative agency
 par is desh ke aam aadmi ne hamen kai saboot bheje hai
 He said that a hospital was to be built on 350 acres of land in Gurgaon
 par haryana sarkaar 09 march 2007 main dlef ko SEZ banane kii anumati de di
 Subsequently, the people from whom it was acquired went to court after which the court stayed the SEZ
 arvind kejariwal ne kaha, haryana sarkaar ne 1700 karod keemat kii gudgaanv kii jameen dlef ko de di
 The same land was purchased from farmers at a price of Rs 20 lakh per acre and was given to DLF at a cost of Rs 5 crore
 unhone kaha ki robert wadra ne dlef ke 25000 share kharide
 Which was sold to DLF within a year
 is dauraan dlef ko kis tarah ke phaayde pahunchaae gaye isaki jaanch honi chahie
 He said that DLF had given a total of 85 crore rupees, not 65, without interest
 kejariwal ke aaropon ke mutabik haryana sarkaar lagaataar DLF ke liye kisi agent kii tarah kaam kar rahi thi
 If the truth of Kejriwal is true, then the Haryana government also gave 350 acres of forest land to DLF
 wo bhi bina centre or sambandhit vibhaagon kii ijaajat liye bina
 Kejriwal has accused the Haryana government of forcing farmers to sell their land to DLF
 kejariwal ke mutabik haryana kii hooda sarkaar ne adhigrahan kaa notice dekar kisaanon ko itnaa majaboor kar diya ki wo apni jameen dlef ko saste main bechney ke liye taiyaar ho gaye
 Kejriwal once again targeted Robert Vadra
 arvind ne kaha ki dlef ne aakhir kyon do saalon tak naa to wadra se 50 karod rupee waapas liye or naa hi jameen lee
 Also, Arvind Kejriwal showed the papers saying that Vadra was sold the flat cheaply but crores of rupees were shown separately when the matter was heated
 robert wadra, hooda sarkaar or dlef kii mileebhagat kii pole kholte hue kejariwal ne haryana sarkaar se white paper laane kii maang kii he
 Kejriwal has also pointed fingers at the clean chit of Congress ministers to Sonia Gandhi's son-in-law Robert Vadra
 khaskar vitt mantri pi chidambaram rahe kejariwal ke nishane par the
 On the matter of giving Chidambaram a clean chit to Vadra, Kejriwal has asked whether Chidambaram is Vadra's income tax officer? Kejriwal said, "DLF said that it did not give any risky loan to Vadra
 lekin companyj of register se mili kaagaj kuch or kahani kah rahe hai
 DLF gave a risky loan of Rs 85 crore and not Rs 65 crore

 ’ haalanki, unhone doharaaya ki mukherjee ko lekar team anna kaa rukh yah he ki ve ‘daagi’ hai

 During a special conversation with Aaj Tak, Naqvi rejected the election commissioner's statement and said that elections within India are fair and free
 chunaav ayukta opi ravat ke chunaavon ko lekar die gaye bayaan par kendriya mantri mukhtaar abbaas nakvi kaa kahana he ki bharat ke andar chunaav saaf-suthere or nishpaksh hote hai
 Political parties contest elections, they fight only to win elections

 There should be talk of good governance
 aakhri paaydaan par khadey vyakti uske vikaas kii baat honi chahie

 Other countries also study and write our electoral process
 gauratlab he ki chunaav ayukta opi ravat ne ek bayaan main kaha he ki aajkal raajnneetik partiyon kaa uddeshy har haal main chunaav jeetna ban gaya he
 It has become a practice to win elections in one way or the other
 lekin loktantr tabhi acha lagata he jab chunaav nishpaksh or sahi tareeke se ho
 BJP should understand the Election Commission's gesture: Congress leader Ajay Maken said that the BJP should understand the Election Commission's gesture
 chunaav ayog ne jo kaha vah behad gambhir he
 If the Chief Election Commission has said this, it will have to be thought of somewhere
 is tarah se dhan bal kaa upyog karnaa kahaan tak sahi he?unhone aage kaha ki abhi adani ke bare main ham log ne aapako bataaya ki lagaataar kis tarah se bhrashtachar ho rahaa he

 After Vidarbha, Bundelkhand of Uttar Pradesh is now becoming a stronghold of farmers 'suicides, but the government is manipulating the data to show farmers' suicides
 jalon jile ke doordaraj ke tikar gaanv main tilak chand kii maut ko ek haftaa ho gaya he
 Havan is going on at home for peace
 bemausam barish main unki gehun kii aadhi fasal barabaad ho gai
 Tilak Chand borrowed 35 thousand rupees from a local money lender and that too at a very high interest
 tilak chand ke pita kapil singh bataate hai, meri potee daudti hui ai ki chachaa ne khud ko faansee laga lee he, main daudta hua aayaa to use ghar main mrit paaya
 But the district administration is arguing differently
 prashasan kaa kahana he ki tilak chand sharaabi tha or ghar main kalah ke chalate usne jaan de di
 Tilak Chand is not alone
 prashasan ne khudakushi ke 24 maamle darj kiye hai, lekin march ke maheene main jo bhi mautein hui hai, unhen yaa to prakritik maut qaraar diya gaya he yaa phir pariwarik kalah se maut
 Social workers say that the figures are being manipulated to reduce farmers' suicides
 'parmarth' enjio ke sanjay singh kehete hai, aksar sarkarein kahati hai ki unke rajya main khudakushi kii ghatnaayen nahin ho rahi hai, kyonki ve isi pratishtha se jodakar dekhati hai, lekin hakeekat isse alag he
 In 2013, 750 cases of farmer suicides were reported in UP and this figure is double the number of unemployed suicides and second only to the suicides of the women taking care of the house
 fasal chaupat hone ke baad hui mauton ko dekhakar mukhyamantri ne raahat kaa elaan to kiya, lekin sabase badi samasya yah he ki duusare rajyon kii tarah upi main khudakushi karne vaale kisaanon ke pariwaron ke liye na to muaavze kii koi spasht niti he or na hi unke punarvaas kii
 UP Planning Commission member Sudhir Panwar says that if we formulate a policy of relief for such cases, it would mean that we expect suicide by the people
 isse saamaajik samasyaayein paidaa hongi
 There may be different arguments about the reason for farmers' suicides, but there can be no two opinions about the plight of farmers dependent on farming, which is a big question on our system
 bhartiya vayusena sukhoi-30 ladaaku vimaanon ko or zyada maarak banane kii taiyaari main he
 Within two years from now, the Indian Air Force is planning to equip Sukhoi-30 fighter jets with Israeli derby missiles
 aisa 27 farvari ko pakistani vayusena ke saath hui bhidnt ke baad kiya ja rahaa he, jisamen F-16 kaa muqabla karne main rus main bani aar-77 se las hamaare ladaaku vimaan peeche rah gaye the
 Airforce sources told NDTV that we already have that missile under the Spider (ground-to-air) system
 sukhoi-30 se uskaa integration aglaa kadam hoga
 On 26 February, the Pakistani Air Force deployed 24 fighter jets along the Line of Control (loc) while responding to an Indian Air Force air strike at jaish-e-mohammed's training camp in Balakot
 inamen se kuch vimaanon ne rajouri sector main bhartiya sainya thikaanon or sena kii pojishans ko nishaanaa banane ke liye elosi paar kar aae the
 As soon as India came to know that the us-built AIM-120 C5 Advanced Medium Range air-to-air Missiles (AMRAAM) has been launched from Pakistan, 8 fighter aircraft including two Sukhoi-30 mkis were sent to chase
 Gone
 AMRAAM ne bharat kii air-tu-air mixilon ko peeche chhod diya
 Sameer Joshi, who fought the Kargil war, said that the Pakistani Air Force surprised the Indian Air Force by launching air-to-air missiles inside Pakistan-occupied Kashmir
 unhone kaha ki AMRAAM ne prabhavi rup se aieef kii hawa se hawa main maar karne vaali missile ko peeche chhod diya, jise launch karne kaa koi nirdesh nahin diya gaya tha
 Two of the fighter jets of the Indian Air Force that were targeted were the Sukhoi-30, which managed to evade the amraams
 inhen unki adhiktam 100 kilometre kii seemaa se fire kiya gaya tha
 These amraams escaped the Indian ayf's Sukhoi-30 being shot down but were unable to respond to the F-16 aircraft as they were out of position and did not have the range of R-77 Russian missiles that they could muster in Pakistani combat
 Aim planes
 bhartiya vaayu sena ke sutron ne NDTV ko bataaya ki roosi misile 80 kilometre se adhik dur ke lakshyon ko nishaanaa nahin bana paatin
 To meet its requirements, the Indian Air Force is looking forward to the i-derby version of the Israeli missile, which was unveiled at the 2015 Paris Air Show
 missile ko roosi ladaaku vimaanon ke saath jodna ek chunauti hogi
 Also, according to sources, this would require Israeli expertise in developing a data-link, especially between the Sukhoi-30 and the missile
 fiter jet data link ke madhyam se missile ke saath communicket karata he or ladaaku vimaan ke apadated vactor (sthaan) se gujarata he, jise nishaanaa banaaya janaa he
 The Indian Navy had paired the old variant of the Derby missile with the retired Sea Harrier fighters for the first time
 yah missile swadeshi tejas fiter kaa praathmik air-tu-air hathiyaar bhi he, jo bhartiya sena main shaamil ho chukaa he
 The derby is also a part of the Air Force surface-to-air SPYDER missile batteries
 ai-darbi missile, jis par ab vichaar kiya ja rahaa he vah vartmaan main seva main shaamil mixilon se bahut adhik advance he
 According to an article in Aviation Week, the new missile is lighter and more compact than its predecessor
 yahi vajah he ki ai-darbi iaar missile kii range 100 kimi se adhik bad jaati he
 The i-derby is not the only missile the Air Force is considering to modernize its Sukhoi-30 fleet
 europea MBDA dwaara banaai gai advance short range air-tu-air missile (ASRAAM) pehali missile he, jiskaa 2014 main air force ke jaguaar bede ke liye adhigrahan kiya gaya tha
 It was part of a £ 250 million deal
 iskaa pareekshan bengaluru sthit rashtriya airospes prayogshaalaon main sukhoi 30 ke model ke saath wind tanals main kiya gaya tha
 Once fully integrated, it will replace the R-73 short range air-to-air missile currently in use in the Sukhoi-30 fleet
 iske saath hi, bhartiya vaayu sena sukhoi -30 ke liye swadeshi estra air-tu-air missile kaa moolyankan kar rahaa he
 Air Force sources told NDTV that the Astra is still being worked on
 philhal simit siries utpaadan ke tahat philhal in 50 mixilon kaa order de diya gaya he
 This is to say that the Air Force wants missiles with extended range variants
 lekin philhal sutron kii maane to estra em ke 2 ko abhi hamaare paas aane main das saal lag jaaenge yahi vajah he ki ai-darbi kii ore praathmik taur par dekha ja rahaa he

 Micah often helps people
 is baar bhi unhone savi kii aise maukey par madad kii jab unako jarurat thi
 This should not be taken lightly
 sochaa janaa chahie or poocha janaa chahie ki wo koun si shaktiyaan hai, wo koun se log hai or wo log kis raajnneetik kheme ke saath nazar aate hai jo baar-baar gandhi ke hatyare ko avatar bataane chale aate hai
 This is not the first time Godse has been described as a patriot
 bhopal se bijepi kii ummidavaar pragna thakur ne kaha he ki nathuram godse deshbhakt he
 Is not a terrorist
 2014 main bijepi ke saansad sakshi maharaj ne maharashtra ke ek kaarykram main kaha tha ki godse rashtravaadi tha
 Godse's birthday was being celebrated as Shaurya Divas in Maharashtra
 tab bijepi ne sakshi maharaj ke bayaan se kinaaraa kar liya tha
 Sakshi Maharaj is again in the election field from Unnao in UP
 iske baad bhi bijepi ke bheetar se godse ke samarthak nikal aate hai
 Pragya Thakur is not an ordinary candidate
 maalegaanv bam dhamaake main aaropee hone ke baad bhi bijepi se lekar pradhanmantri modi ne pragna thakur kii ummidavaari kaa bachaav kiya tha
 When questions were raised about Pragya's candidature, Prime Minister Modi said in an interview that the decision to remove Pragya was a befitting reply to those who linked religion and culture to terrorism
 congress ne bina saboot ke duniya main paanch hazaar saal tak, jis mahaan samskruti or parampara ne vasudaiv kutunbakam kaa sandesh diya, survey bhavantu sukhin kaa sandesh diya, aisi samskruti ko aatankwaadi kah diya, un sabko jawaab dene ke liye ye ek pratik hai jo congress ko mahangaa padane vaala he
 That is, Pragya Thakur was not the usual candidate for Prime Minister Modi
 is pragna thakur ne yahaan tak kah diya ki mumbai hamalon main aatankwaadiyon se ladate hue shahid hone vaale hemanth karkare kii maut unke shaap ke kaaran hui thi
 Then there was an uproar as to whether the terror attack was caused by Pragya Thakur's curse, Pragya Thakur did not curse Kasab, why cursed Hemant Karkare
 sawaal uthaa to pragna thakur ko bayaan waapas lenaa padaa tha
 The statement was criticized by Maharashtra leaders
 mukhyamantri devend fadanvis ne pragna thakur ke bayaan kii aalochana kii thi
 Hemant Karkare was described as a Jabanz police officer
 magar devendra fadanvis ke bayaan se alag sumitra mahajan kaa bayaan tha
 He said that Hemant Karkare is a martyr but his role as ATS chief is questionable
 zaahir he hemanth karkare ko lekar maharashtra main kuch sochaa ja rahaa he, madhya pradesh main kuch sochaa ja rahaa he
 Even after this statement, Pragya Thakur is describing Godse as a patriot
 achaanak niklaa hua bayaan to nahin ho saktaa he
 Those who are in thinking ideology, the same thinking comes down in statements
 camel hasan ke bayaan kii aalochana ke naam par godse ko deshbhakt bataanaa saamaanya ghatana nahin he
 Even after 71 years of Gandhi's assassination, Godse's idol is being built, jubilee is feeling, being described as patriot
 gandhi ke hatyare ko deshbhakt bataane kii jaldi kya he
 Congress party spokesperson Randeep Surjewala has strongly criticized Pragya Thakur's statement and sought a response from Amit Shah and Prime Minister Modi
 pichley saal abhinav bharat ke pankaj fadanis supreme court pahunch jate hai ki godse kii sazaa par phir se sunwaayee ho
 The Supreme Court refused to hear the case
 lekin iske baad bhi godse ke samarthakon kii kami nahin he
 There is no dearth of people celebrating Godse Jayanti
 meerut main 2 aktubar 2016 ke din jis din mahatma gandhi kaa janmdin hota he, usee din godse kii murti kaa anaavaran kiya gaya tha
 The people of the All India Hindu Mahasabha celebrated Gandhi Day as Dhikkar Day
 wo chaahate the ki meerut kaa naam badalakar godse ke naam par rakh diya janaa chahie
 In 2017, the people of Hindu Mahasabha wanted to build a temple for Godse in Gwalior, the administration did not give permission
 hamaare bich aise tatv hai jo gandhi kii hatya ko phir se jeena chaahate hai
 Want to turn the murder craze into patriotism
 akhil bhartiya hindu mahasabha kii rashtriya sachiv he puja shakun pandey
 This is the video of 30 January 2019
 isamen puja shakun pandey gandhi kii tasviir par goli chalaa rahi hai or koon nikal rahaa he
 Some people want to live the assassination of Gandhi
 uskaa sukh lenaa chaahate hai
 It is not the staging of Gandhi's assassination, but the practice of producing murderers in society who feel that it is permissible to kill anyone from Gandhi
 hatya ke baad mithai banti gai thi
 Pooja Shakun Pandey is not alone in this video
 unke saath kai log hai
 These are the people who are acting to justify Gandhi's assassination
 ji rahe hai
 You may think that the statements and acting of Pragya Thakur to Pooja Shakun Pandey are normal, but they are not so low
 aae din godse ko mahaan bataane vaala koi hamaare saamne aa jaataa he
 Pooja Shakun Pandey was arrested
 philhal puja shakun pandey jail se baahar hai
 There are elements that keep Godse alive
 gandhi kii hatya par jashn manaane vaale ye koun log hai
 Why do they always come out of the bjp's court
 camel hasan ke bayaan kaa sahaara lekar pragna thakur godse ko deshbhakt bataa rahi hai
 Whether or not someone can be called a terrorist can be debated, but with his support, what is your point of calling Godse a patriot? camel hasan ke bayaan par bijepi chunaav ayog gai shikaayat lekar, pragna thakur ke bayaan ko lekar bhi kya bijepi chunaav ayog jaaegi
 Pragya Thakur's statement that Hemant Karkare's martyrdom was the result of his curse may not have come out suddenly
 unki soch bataa rahi he ki ve godse ke bare main kya sochati hai, hemanth karkare ke bare me kya soch rahi hai
 Is there any confusion in the ideology camp about Gandhi's assassination? gandhi kii hatya ko jaays tehraane kii jaldi he
 One should be alert to the statements of Pragya Thakur and Sakshi Maharaj
 gandhi kii hatya puri maanavtaa par ek daag he
 Those waiting to justify his assassination on the basis of political power do not know that it is the power of Gandhi whose picture the Prime Minister has to keep in his office
 dikhaai dena padataa he gandhi ke saath
 Now come to Bengal
 yahaan vidyasagar kii murti tode jane kii ghatana ne donon raajnneetik dalon ko bhida diya he
 Some more videos of the Kolkata incident have surfaced
 ek video hamen whats ap se mila he
 The video shows BJP workers attacking Vidyasagar Gate
 dhai minute kaa yah video he aap puraa dekhie
 It has also been submitted to the Election Commission
 trinmul netaa derek o bryan ne kai video twit kiye hai or chunaav ayog ko bhi jamaa karaayaa he
 Even today Derek o'brien has tweeted a video to prove that BJP leaders are committing violence
 ham jo video dikhaa rahe hai usase lagata to he ki bijepi ne hinsa kii he magar ek baat kaa dhyaan rakhiegaa
 We do not have a video of what happened from within the college
 jarur police or chunaav ayog ke cameraman ke paas hona chahie
 We saw in many videos that BJP people were attacking the college and were also making videos from their mobiles
 iske baad hamane bengal bijepi ke chif dilip ghosh ke twitor acount par jaakar dekha ki kya unke paksh ko sabit karne vaala video he
 In which Trinamool workers are showing hooliganism or stone is running from inside the college
 hamane bengal bijepi ke prabharee kailash vijayawargeey ke twitor hander par jaakar check kiya
 There is a video of a news channel in which some people are attacking the college gate but in the same video Derek o'brien showed that BJP workers are breaking
 kailash vijayawargeey ke twitor handle main ek video aplod kiya he
 This video is about his party's promotion
 yah video bangla main he
 Religious symbols have been used in it
 pataa chalata he ki amit shah ke road sho main dharmik jhaanki nikaali gai
 Rama and Lakshmana remain, have gone to the road show with a large statue of Rama
 jai shri ram ke naare lag rahe hai
 Mamta Banerjee has been shown to be a supporter of a particular religious community
 unhen hinduon ko maarane vaala bataaya he
 This video is completely communal
 agar vaaki chunaav ayog hota to karrwai karata
 The video also shows activists battling police attacking Vidyasagar College
 isamen hindu voter kii baat kii gai he or ant main jai shri ram kaa naaraa lagata he or amit shah kaa cheharaa aakraamak rup se laal ho jaataa he
 If such a video was made for the promotion of another party, the Election Commission would have remembered its rules, but the way religious symbols and slogans have been used in this BJP promotional video, it seems that the Election Commission should choose its work carefully Used to be
 yah video kailash vijayawargeey ke twitor handle par maujuud hai
 Today Mamta Banerjee has released a video of one person Rakesh Singh
 is video main rakesh singh bijepi ke tishart main he or hinsa kii baat kar rahaa he
 Talking about being prepared for violence
 mamata banerjee yah dikhaa kar aarope laga rahi hai ki bijepi ke netaa hinsa kii taiyaari kar rahe the
 BJP Chief of Bengal Dilip Ghosh has defended Rakesh Singh's statement
 kaha he ki agar koi party kaaryakarta apni suraksha kii baat kar rahaa he to isamen koi harj nahin he
 Rakesh Singh has said in a statement to Boom Live
 rakesh singh par kai aapraadhik maamle darj hai
 Rakesh Singh has been the first Congress candidate
 vidhansabha chunaav ke baad rakesh singh bijepi main aa gaya
 Krishnchand Vairagi appeared on the road of Kolkata as Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar
 bijepi ke samarthak hai
 Krishnchand Vairagi says that for thirty years he has been wearing the guise of different great men of Bengal
 bijepi kaa ummidavaar ab krishnachand vairaagi ko vidyasagar banaakar kolkata main ghuma rahe hai ki unki party vidyasagar kaa kam sammaan nahin karti he
 Vairagi ji said that last night i
e
 on the night of May 15, he has been caught by BJP
 kiraaye par vidyasagar bijepi to le ai magar maamla murti tode jane ko lekar he
 This also had an impact on the Prime Minister's meeting today
 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki unki party vidyasagar kii oonchi pratimaa banavaayegi
 At the same place
 mamata banerjee ne to 15 may ko hi vidyasagar ke sammaan main march kar diya tha
 In his march, activists brought photographs of the great men of Bengal
 mamata kahati hai ki pradhanmantri ko samarpit ek kaali pratimaa honi chahie jo apatkaal kii yaad dilaae
 Mamta did not say that the statue of the Prime Minister should be installed, but watch the language game here
 kahati hai ki pradhanmantri ko samarpit ek kaali murti honi chahie
 Mamta Banerjee had a rally in Diamond Harbor
 jahaan ek din pehle pradhanmantri kii raily thi
 At the Diamond Harbor rally, Mamta filled her entire speech with the pride of Bengal
 mamata ne kaha ki jab bharat ko azaadi mili tab gandhi bengal main the
 The national anthem is the gift of Bengal
 jai hind or vandemataram bengal kii dein he
 Netaji formed the Indian National Army
 ishwarchandra vidyasagar gyaan ke sagar the
 Mamta said that Trinamool has not broken the idol
 trinmul aisa kaam nahin karti he
 Mamta's speech was offensive
 hadein bhi tut rahi thim
 Said how much Narendra Modi you know Mamata Banerjee
 uskaa sara jivan goli or bandook se ladate hue guzaaraa he
 Prime Minister Modi had a rally in Kolkata
 damdam main raily karte hue unhone dharmik mudda uthaa diya
 Now the election is coming to an end
 chunaav ayog kya sangyaan legaa
 Bengal is an election, so there was talk of an intruder
 phir bijepi or pradhanmantri ko bataanaa chahie ki citijan amendament bill paas kyon nahin karaayaa
 Although the interpretation of citizenship on communal grounds was criticized regarding this bill, the government did not pass it from the Rajya Sabha in view of the violence against the bill in Assam and the North East
 kya ek samudaay vishesh ko target karne ke liye ghuspaithiyon kaa mudda banaaya ja rahaa he
 Then why the Ministry of Home Affairs of the Government of India and the Government of Assam had to hear rebuke for not completing the work of the National Register
 supreme court kii fatkaar ke bare main internet search kiijie
 In this election, an election is also being held with the Election Commission
 kolakata main amit shah ke road sho ke dauraan hui hinsa ke baad chunaav ayog ne 9 siton ke liye prachaar 20 ghante pehle roak diya
 The quarrel took place between the BJP and the Trinamool, but the Congress was also punished, the CPM also got and the independents who had nothing to do with the incident
 aakhir chunaav ayog ne sabhi kaa prachaar 20 ghante pehle kyon roka
 The BJP is also accusing the Election Commission of Bengal
 bijepi kaa kahana he ki bengal ke maamle main chunaav ayog nishpaksh nahin he
 The BJP should tell and also to the Election Commission who gave permission to raise religious slogans in its meetings
 jai shri ram kaa naaraa kya dharmik naaraa nahin tha
 If there is an Election Commission, should the Election Commission not tell whether Amit Shah's roadshow is a religious roadshow or a political roadshow
 kya chunaav ke samay main dharmik jhaankiyon ke saath road sho nikaalane kii ijazat di ja sakati he
 Did the Chief Election Commissioner ask the Bengal supervisor, with whose permission, this religious visit was going out? kya amit shah ke road sho kaa koi or makasad tha
 Can any other party be allowed to take out such roadshow
 supreme court ne kaha he ki dharmik bhaavana or pratikon kaa istemaal nahin hona chahie tha
 When the court asked the commission, Azam Khan and Yogi Adityanath were banned from campaigning on Maneka Gandhi for making religious statements
 kya ayog bharat kii janata ko aguket kar saktaa he bataa saktaa he ki ye dharmik raily kiski ijazat se nikal rahi he
 Can the Supreme Court take cognizance
 baat he ki is par baat kyon nahin ho rahi he
 We are in election or in Ramlila Maidan

 Google's decree will not talk on politics
 employeedonald Trump had accused of bias In this era of communication revolution, people google for any kind of information and they get answers to their questions
 lekin kya aapako pataa he search ingine company google ne apane karmchaariyon ke liye nayaa farmaan jari kiya he or wo ye he ki ab wo daftar main kisi bhi tarah kii raajnneetik baaten nahin kar sakate hai
 Action will be taken against the employees who do so or they may go to their jobs

 The managers of different departments and the people who lead the forum have been asked to ensure this and have also been cautioned to take disciplinary action against the violator
 nae disha nirdesh ko america chunaav main raashtrapati trump ke hera-pheri ke aarope se jodakar dekha ja rahaa he

 aisa hone par logon ke bich hamaari company se bharosa kam hoga
 Let us tell you that based on the statement of an engineer fired from Google, US President Donald Trump alleged that Google manipulated 16 million votes in favor of Democratic Party presidential candidate Hillary Clinton
 haalanki google ne raashtrapati trump ke bayaan ko puri tarah bebuniyaad bataaya tha or kaha tha ki company kisi bhi tarah kaa raajnneetik jhukaav nahin rakhti he

 68-year-old Srikrishna Kalgaonkar, a retired professor of pure mathematics in Kolhapur, Maharashtra, went to a friend's 'vada' (a huge traditional house) in Kasba Bawda village to get some old gramophone records about 15 years ago
 unka iraadaa apane collection ke aankade ko 4,500 tak pahunchaana tha
 In these dust-burning records, he found a record of the speeches of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose
 indian neshnal army (iene) ke mukhiya kaa yah bhaashan yang india company ne us samay record kiya tha, jab ve bhartiya rashtriya congress (ienci) main hi sakriy the
 With a pledge to acquaint the youth with the legacy of this great nationalist leader, Kalgaonkar has planned to play this record in public places during the 10-day Ganesh Utsav which is going to begin on September 19 in his city
 hindi main die apane paanch minute ke bhaashan main netaji ne bhartiya yuvaaon se aahvaan kiya he ki ve ekajute ho jaaen or british shashan ke khilaaf sangharsh karen
 The record also bears the signature of Netaji in green, but does not mention the date on which it was recorded
 yah andaja lagaaya ja saktaa he ki yah iene ke gathan ke pehle kaa bhaashan he kyonki isamen bose yuvaaon se congress main shaamil hone kii apil kar rahe hai
 Bose's voice is still loud and clear in this record of 72 rpm (minutes on rotation)
 kalgamvakar kehete hai, ''mujhe puraa bharosa he ki netaji kii aawaaj yuvaaon ko romanchit kar degi
 "he admits that after getting a rare audio clip of Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak in Pune in August, he was inspired to play Netaji's record in public places
 kalgamvakar ne india today se kaha, ''haalanki, maine netaji ko bahut zyada nahin padhaa he, lekin unke bhaashan ke is record kii mere dil main khaas jagah he
 i keep cleaning it every day and spend a lot of time in it
 ”unhen is baat kii pukhta jaankaree nahin he ki yah record durlabh he yaa nahin

" shantaram kii company) kai dashak pehle hi band ho chuki he

 ”ek utsaahi sangrahakarta kalgamvakar ke paas 61 gramophone player hai
 He is a huge fan of music director Naushad
 unhone bataaya ki naushaad ne kul 64 filmon main hi mujic diya he or ''mere paas naushaad kii 58 filmon ke discs hai
 To prove his point, he cites the quote of nuclear scientist Morris Eddington that contrary to our belief, human effort is not as important in an event

 BSNL ke pehle plan STV 35 kii baat karen to company isamen pehle 200MB data detii thi
 However, now BSNL has made a big change in this and now the company will give 5GB of data to its customers with a validity of 5 days in it

 haalanki data 25 guna zyada diya ja rahaa he
 This information has been received from telecomtalk
 duusare plan kii baat karen to ye plan 53 rupee vaala he
 In this plan too, earlier 250MB data was given with a validity of 21 days
 haalanki ab is plan main graahakon ko pehle se kahin zyada 8GB data milegaa
 But the company has reduced the validity from 7 days to 14 days
 company dwaara is kadam ko sahi mana ja saktaa he, kyonki maujuuda trend ke hisaab se 8GB data ko 21 dinon tak ekstand kar paanaa kaaphi mushkil he
 Finally, talking about STV 395, now customers will get the benefit of unlimited calling and national roaming (except Delhi and Mumbai) in this plan
 saath hi graahakon ko yahaan roj 2GB data bhi milegaa
 After 2GB of data, the internet speed will be 80 Kbps
 is plan kii validity 71 dinon kii hogi
 Earlier, in this plan of BSNL, customers were given the benefits of 3000 minutes on net calls and 1800 off net voice calls with 2GB data daily
 in sabake alaava aapako bataa den company ne haal hi main apane 999 rupee or 2099 rupee vaale do plance ko band kiya he
 Both these plans used to get 365 days validity
 saath hi beasenel ne BSNL Sixer 666 kii validity ko bhi badhaayaa he
 Earlier, customers used to get 122 days validity in this plan, now the company has increased the validity of this plan to 134 days

 (from input language) maa bananaa duniya ke sabase sukhad anubhav main se ek he or yahi vajah he ki pregnancy ke dauraan mahilaon ko bahut sari saavdhaaniyaan baraten kii salaah di jaati he
 But at the same time, due to lack of correct information, many times pregnant women also have to face trouble
 pregnancy ke dauraan hells na pahananaa, aaraam karnaa or zyada kaam na karne jaisi bhrantiyaan sadiyon se chali aa rahi hai
 Recently, Bollywood actress Shreekrina Kapoor Khan's pregnancy is very much in the news
 aisa isliye he kyonki karina pregnancy ke saare myth todakar ek nayaa aayam bana rahi hai
 From their looks to their work style, they are becoming a motive factor for pregnant women
 saf ke liye ek baar phir dulhan bani pregnent karinie jaane, ye 5 baaten jo karina kapur khan ko pregnancy queen banaati hai
 
 
 1
 pregnancy main zyada kaam maa or bachche ko pahunchaata he nuksonstress lenaa yun to kisi kii bhi sehat ke liye acha nahin hota he, khaastaur par pregnancy ke dauraan
 Therefore, try to stay away from stress, not from your work
 agar aap biji or active rahengi to yah aapke or bachche donon ke liye acha rahegaa
 Kareena is also trying to tell the same thing
 2
 Pregnant ladies should not wear heels; High heels have nothing to do with pregnancy
 iskaa fact ye he ki doctor balance bigadane, pair slip hone yaa mudane yaa girane ke dar se inhen na pahanane kii salaah dete hai
 But keeping health in mind, wearing heels in the first quarter of pregnancy does not hurt
 karina pregnancy ke dauraan or bhi active or fashneble najar aa rahi hai
 These looks of Kareena Kapoor Khan will also make you a fashionable in pregnancy
 
 
 3

 What to tell, how to experience, of this rare life! How have passed friends! These eight decades of life
 kabhi jab nai kavita or geet main phonk na thim, nai kavita ke saath geet kii sangat chalati thi
 Many new poets wrote songs, poets of Saptvak tradition are proof that there was a hatred of new songs with new poetry
 navgiton par sooryakanth treepathi niraala kii chand parampara kaa varadahast rahaa to prayogvaadi kavita ke pravartak kavi sachchidanand hiranand vatsyayan agyeya ke man main bhi geeton ko lekar ek sakaaratmak bhav vidyaman tha
 But gradually after the octave, the lyricists felt that we should choose a different path
 nai kavita main hamaari samaai nahin he
 The agnostic who once said that the verse has no power in me, some new lyricists searched their way with the same sentiment
 jin dinon vanshi or madal ke kathyon or rup kii charchaa ho rahi thi, adivaasiyon or santhali lok se uske rishte khangale ja rahe the, geet ko anayas yah raah mil gayi
 While moving on this path, among the newly used poets were Thakur Prasad Singh on one side, Om Prabhakar and Umakant Malaviya, on the other hand, poets like Maheshwarkar Tiwari, Naeem and Kumar Ravindra came forward
 gitangini or paanch jod bansuri jaise sankalnon ne is disha main aitihaasik neenv kaa kaam kiya
 Later, the new song movement was commanded by able poets like Shambhunath Singh, in which Maheshwar Tiwari has his place
 unhone geet ko nae bimbon, nae pratikon or yathartwaadee agrahon ke saath joda or uske bhitari laalitya kii bhi raksha kii
 The new song has so far traveled a long way, but today when looking at its tradition, one remembers the poets who prepared the song's land with the feeling of 'anjuri Anjuri khoon hai main bhi mein this Taj Mahal'
 is ujjwal parampara main thakurprasad singh, kishan saroj, maheshwar tiwari, satyajanarayan, devendra kumaar, vijay kishor maanav se lekar yash malviya or nai peedi main chitransh baaghmare jaise kavi shaamil hai
 Years ago, when it was the golden age of commercial family magazines like Dharmayuga, the weekly Hindustatan, Maheshwar Tiwari's songs were printed, reading it as if the mood of the mind would change
 jivan kii ub kahin kho jaati
 Needless to say, the songs were published brilliantly by popular magazines like Hindustan and Dharmyug
 aaj ke sampadakon kii tarah unki pasand jadibhoot na thi
 a poet capable of new poetry like Dharamvir Bharti recognized the power of the songs
 maheshwar tiwari ke tamaam geet in patrikaon main chape
 Maheshwar Tiwari tried to tie the song to the new architectural structure through a sensitive song like 'dhoop Mein Jale Hain Paon Ghar Ki Yaad Aayi'
 lakhanu main rahete hue maine unka navagit sangrah 'harsingaar koi to ho' padhaa tha or us par ek sudeergh samiksha tab ke navajivan main likhi thi, jo sanyog se ab file main nahin he

 uske baad 'sach kii koi shart nahin' va 'phool aae hai coneron main' jaise sangrah aae jo unke rachanaatmak satatya kaa parichaayak hai
 Maheshwar Tiwari, born on 22 July 1939 in Basti, Uttar Pradesh, has turned 80 today
 ek sudeergh yatra main unhone jivan ko jaise geet-sangeet kii tarah saadhaa he
 Even in the songs of Chhoti Bahr, they kill
 unka ek aisa hi geet achaanak samaran ho aayaa he jo unke mizaaj kii gavaahi detaa he
 Today i want to sing songs, i want to be wowed, i want to live in my shadow, i want to live in the flowers, i want to live in the shadows
 uskaa har antara jaise dil kii bhitari satahon ko choota hua rachaa gaya he
 Remember someone like you, fill a pitcher
 jaise koi kiran akeliparvat paar kare
 The returning cows of kesang-sangyad would come to you and dust would touch my forehead and in the shadow, their own shadow emerged, like a swan landed in lonely

 Moradabad, which has been known due to brass for centuries, is now known for their songs
 un goshtiyon ke liye pahachaanaa jaataa he jo aksar unki adhyalata va saannnidhya main hoti hai
 Often, his house is full of songwriters
 geet sangeet kii raagini bajati rahati he
 Now the house is full of tweet of children
 unhen jivan main anek puraskaar mili
 But he never made the award a standard
 unako chaahane vaale beshumaar log hai
 They remain creatively active even in the future of life
 pichley ek saal pehle unase gambhir samachar ke liye kuch nae geet maange to unhone bade prem se mujhe whatssop par bheja
 His hand written songs are still a legacy for me
 maheshver tiwari un chand logon main hai jinka adhyayan vipul he
 His songs are short but he looks like a flower like a flower of Kumudini
 'lagata jaise is pal koi geeton bhari sadi soi he' kehane vaale maheshwar tiwari ke geet pard kar lagata he inamen unhone bansuri kii phunk bhar di he
 Maheshwar Tiwari's post structure is undoubtedly romantic, he sees a new and untouched leak of images which is not seen in his other contemporaries
 aaj bhi ve jab kisi baat par vihval hote hai, koi nai anuthi cheez padhate hai, ve logon se samvaad karte hai
 Bless them
 unka man itnaa paardarshee or ragaatmak he ki vah apane bheetar jaise ek vrundavanataa kaa bhavasansar sanjoye rahata he
 That is why even today, he is looked forward to for Vrindavan for which he always feels indebted
 
 
 man kaa vrindavan ho janakitna acha he,tumme hi milakar kho janakitna acha he
 There is no hesitation in saying that there is no other Maheshwar Tiwari in the world of song-navigat-jagat

 petrol pump par aksar nakli dijal petrol beche jane kii khabaren aati rahati hai
 Government officials often arrive to check on the petrol pump
 lekin aajkal ek aisa video viral ho rahaa he jisamen petrol pump par jaanch karne ke liye koi afasar nahin, balki ekbandarpahunch gaya
 So now, no one will give petrol pump oil any less? So, will no one now be able to adulterate the petrol pump? So now, no one will be able to rig a petrol pump? In which era the price of petrol and diesel has come down
 aise main ye bandar petrol kii quality se lekar quantity bhi check kar rahaa he
 Yes, this monkey is going viral on social media
 is bandar ke bare main daawa kiya ja rahaa he ki ye bandar tank main jhankkar or soonghkar bataa detaa he ki petrol pump vaale ne tel sahi daalaa he yaa nahin
 As soon as a bike comes to put petrol, it jumps and sits on the bike tank
 pehle celsman ko bike main petrol daalane detaa he, jaise hi celsman petrol daalkar hatataa he, bandar tank main haath daal detaa he, petrol ko chakhkar dekhtaa he, is tarah ye 6 dfa karata he, iske baad 2 baar apane munh ko petrol tank ke najadik le jaataa he or petrol ko soonghta he
 People are saying that this monkey has the ability to check the quality of petrol, can it really happen, so we have its viral test
 sabase pehle to hamane ye jaanane kii koshish ki aakhir ye video he kahaan kaa
 
 
 
 kya is petrol pump par hameshaa ye bandar tainaat rahata he
 a closer look at the video reveals that the number of motorcycles at the petrol pump is UK 06 AA 6435, this tells us that this video is from a petrol pump in Uttarakhand
 hamane uttarakhand main padtaal shuru kii to hamaara andaja sahi niklaa
 This video is of Bajpur city of Udham Singh Nagar in Uttarakhand
 ye hindustan petroleum company kaa petrol pump he
 We contacted the staff of the petrol pump
 petrol pump ke karmchaaree or pump ke maalik ne kaha ki haa, yah video isi petrol pump kaa he or yah koi ek din kaa maamla nahin he balki yah bandar aksar yahaan aata-jaataa rahata he
 He only tastes petrol here, sniffs and then jumps off! This monkey does no harm to anyone
 hamen ye to pataa chal gaya ki petrol pump par ye bandar tainaat rahata he, lekin ye bandar petrol kyon chakhtaa he, tank ke andar munh daalkar petrol kyon soonghta he? is bandar kii sachai ham aapako bataaen usase pehle ye viral video bhi dekh lijie
 In October last year, a monkey in Panipat, Haryana was drinking petrol after taking out a pipe from a motorcycle parked in the parking lot, people used to get worried about where the petrol of their bike disappears, after the video surfaced of the monkey drinking the petrol was revealed
 kaha jaataa he ki is bandar ko petrol kii is kadar lat lag gai ki use acchhee se acchhee cheez bhi khaane ko do to nahin khaataa tha
 Now we wanted to know what is the connection between monkey and petrol
 kya petrol pump par bandar vaaki petrol kii gunvattta check karata he, hamane iske bare main gajiabad ke mukhya pashu chikitsa adhikari vijendra kumaar tyaagi se baat kii to unhone bataaya ki petrol hydro carbon se banataa he, isamen aromatic hydro carbon bhi hote he
 They vaporize
 video dekhne se spasht he ki is bandar ko aromatic hydro carbon ke veppurs kii lat padi hui he or usee ke liye baar-baar aata he, usko soonghney aata he
 Now the public is thinking that the monkey is coming to check the quality of petrol, which is not the case and there is no doubt that monkeys have a lot of sense of power, habit of cheating
 to vaise dekha jaae to yah ek ediction kaa cese he
 So in this way the news of monkey testing the quality of petrol failed in the viral test

 is maheene 21, 22 or 23 janvari ko sahaayak loko payalat or technitian ke 64,317 padon ke liye duusare charan kii pariksha honi he
 a list of student centers has been released 10 days ago
 chaatro ke centre 1,500 se 2,000 kilometre dur die gaye hai
 The railway minister busy re-tweeting the Prime Minister's tweet should note and resolve many such messages coming on his own timeline
 bahut se saadhaaran or kisaan pariwaron ke chaatro ke saamne sankat aa gaya he ki imtihaan dene ke liye ve 10,000-20,000 rupee kahaan se karch karen
 Last year, Railways had vacated 64,317 posts, whose first examination was held in August 2018
 31 march tak farm bhare gaye the
 More than 47 lakh students had filled the forms
 in sabakaa centre achaanak 1,500-2,000 kilometre dur de diya gaya
 No one got reservation in the train, then nobody had ticket money
 kisi tarah imtihaan dene pahunche, to raat platform par guzaari
 Many students were tested because their train was late
 chaatr chillaate rahe, rote rahe, railmantri ko twit karte rahe, magar kisi ko kuch fark nahin padaa
 In August 2018, Railway Minister Piyush Goyal himself tweeted that 74 percent students appeared for the exam
 yani 47
 Out of 56 lakh students, 26 percent were deprived of taking the exam
 is tarah bina imtihaan die hi 12 lakh se adhik chaatr baahar ho gaye
 When the results of the first phase examination came, only 1
2 million students were selected for the second phase
 ab jab sankhya choti ho gai, to inke centre to rajya ke bheetar die ja sakate the
 It is absurd if there is an argument to protect against duplicate gangs, because nowadays such gangs are operating on an all-india level, the government should better monitor its center and not harass students by sending them 2,000 kilometers away
 railmantri ko agar yah hisaab tab bhi samaj nahin aata he, to ek chaatr ne jo hisaab bheja he, vah de detaa hum
 There is only one train from Bikaner to Nagpur, Anubhavrat Express, which runs only one to two days a week
 ek taraf se 26 ghante kaa safar he
 On both sides, the ticket will cost only Rs 3,240
 23 janvari ko pahunchane ke liye use 20 janvari ko nikalnaa padegaa, vaapasi kii train 23 or 24 kii nahin he, to nagpur main do din ruknaa bhi padegaa
 In this way it will take seven days to take an exam
 10,000 se adhik rupee kharch ho jaaenge
 Tell the Railway Minister, what is the point of sending a student from Prayagraj to Hubli in Karnataka
 32 ghante kaa safar tay karnaa padegaa
 That too when your train runs on time, which does not run
 rajasthan ke ganganagar se kisi ko kerala ke kochi main bhejne kaa kya matlab he
 Is this what is called online examination? 
 
 ?gwalior ke ek chaatr ko assam ke tejpur main centre diya gaya he
 a student from Khagaria, Bihar, has been given a center at Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, 1,700 km away
 khagadiya se ek bhi train vahaan nahin jaati he
 a student from Jodhpur has been sent to Rourkela in Odisha, 2,000 km away
 35 ghante kii yatra he or duuri 2,000 kilometre kii
 This student has tweeted to the Railway Minister that there is no ticket in any train
 bengal ke chaatr ko tamilnadu ke thirunelveli centre diya gaya he
 The train does not have a ticket
 pashchim bengal ke chaatr kaa centre mumbai diya gaya he
 Students from Jhansi go to Hyderabad and Pune to West Bengal

 Recently the Railway Minister released a promotional video related to employment on his Twitter handle, whose language suggests that the Railways has already given employment to one lakh people
 sahaayak loko payalat or technitian ke liye form bharne kii antim taarikh 31 march, 2018 thi
 Four months later, the first examination takes place between 9 to 13 August 2018
 is pariksha kaa riselt nikalataa he 20 disambar, 2018 ko, yani saadhe teen maheene baad
 Now the second phase examination will be held on 21, 22, 23 January, 2019
 agar saadhe teen maheene kaa ausat nikaalen, to riselt aate-aate may, 2019 ho jayega
 At that time, Lok Sabha elections will be taking place in the country
 may 2019 main riselt aa bhi jayega, to abhi manovaigyanik or medical jaanch baaki he
 After that the document will be verified
 kul milakar agast, 2019 se pehle antim riselt aane kii sambhaavna nahin he
 Only the Railway Minister should know when they will join
 basharte, unhen yahi pataa ho ki agali baar bhi vahi railmantri banenge yaa nahin
 So my reasoning is that the railway minister should focus less on campaigning and more on work
 rail board se puuchhen ki garib or saadhaaran parivaar ke chaatro ko 2,000 kilometre bhejne kaa kya tuk he
 In what way is it an online exam, for which one has to travel for 35 hours, then one has to travel for 40 hours
 beparwahee kii bhi had hoti he
 The Railway Minister, who has tweeted on the birth anniversary and death anniversary of countless great men, should tweet the problem of these students and find a solution

 According to Nitish, the blame goes to the previous Congress government at the Center, who cut the appointment
 jiske kaaran har rajya main sachiv str ke adhikariyon ke zimme ek se adhik vibhaag hai
 The comments doosraa nitish ne kaha ki adhikariyon kii kami ke kaaran chaahakar bhi naye jile yaa anumandal nahin bana sakate

 The way Anna Hazare and Arvind Kejriwal sparked a controversy and the way he was given a wind in the media, all of us should be worried

 But how much misunderstanding was the letter that Anna wrote about the amount of donations? He could have asked Kejriwal this matter anytime
 aam aadmi party ke kisi bhi padaadhikari ko bulaakar vah poochtacha karvaa sakate the lekin unhone aisa karne kii bajaay ek chitthee likhi jo media main aa gai
 Now the damage is done, political parties have raised questions on Kejriwal's intention and honesty
 ab tak unhen kuch thos nahin mil paa rahaa tha lekin is baar ek mauka mil hi gaya
 Now whatever Anna says, the thing has gone wrong
 bhartiya loktantr ke liye yah hataasha kaa vishay he
 The public wants a change in politics and wants to see some people who are clean
 naitikta or eemaandaaree raajnneeti ke durlabh shabdon main shumaar hote ja rahe hai
 In such a situation, the Aam Aadmi Party has its own importance and people have expectations from it
 bhrashtachar ke samudr main duubate-utaraate desh ke liye yah choti si naiya bhavishya kaa rasta dikhaa rahi he
 This party may not be able to do anything in the elections but it can only show the door of expectations for the future
 isse eemaandaar log raajnneeti main aane se to kataraaenge nahin

 In France and Greece elections this month, people have rejected the strict economic policies of governments
 or udaaravaadi aarthik nitiyon par apni muhar lagaai he
 In the spring of 1931, British economist John Maynard Keynes, confronting his hard-core arch rival Frederick Hayek, argued that when the economy was going through a recession, it was the government's duty to restore growth and create jobs
 Intervene to promote
 unhone maang badhaane ke liye byaaj daron or karon main baari katautee kaa suzav diya tha
 He said that people should be encouraged to spend even if the government takes a loan to pay
 iske jawaab main austria ke arthshaastri haayak kaa kahana tha ki is tarah ke upayon se mukt bazaar kaa 'swaabhaavik' sanchaalan bighad jayega or adhik-se-adhik yah hoga ki log mushkil dinon ko aage ke liye taal denge
 Despite months of intense debate, the deep differences between the two economic thinkers never ended
 cambridge main arthshaastra ke jane-maane profvsar albert pigau ke anusaar, un donon ke bich ''bahut joardaar'' bahes-mubaahisa hua
 Political economists and finance ministers around the world have been arguing on this issue ever since
 kines-haayak vivaad america, europea sangh or britain ke rajnatik vimarsh par haaavee rahe hai
 The reason for this is that the governments there were fighting against the economic crisis created by the collapse of the stock market in 2008 and the subsequent closure of financial institutions
 shuru main to kines samarthakon ko badhat milti dikhi kyonki america raashtrapati jorge dablyoo bush or phir baraak obama ne bainkon ko charmarane se rokane ke liye saarvajanik paise ko bainkon main jhenk diya
 This was followed by a spate of tax relief, aid to the needy, rescue of the crumbling motor industry and bankrupt state governments, and smooth over major infrastructure projects
 lekin kinsvaadi kadam uthaae hi gaye the ki kharidaaron main niraashaa fail gai
 In America, angry taxpayers formed the Tea Party (american People's Political Movement)
 ve karj ke boj se dabe hue the or rojgarahinta kii ashanka se pareshaan the
 In his memorandum to lawmakers, he demanded not only a ban on government borrowing, but also various tax cuts
 obama ko jaldi hi ehsaas ho gaya ki 500 arab dollar ke ek or packwj ke liye ve congress main haikwadiyon ko raji nahin kar sakate
 However, he emphasized that it was necessary to provide employment to Americans
 udhar, republican sadasyon ne madhyavadhi chunaav jeetne ke baad samajhaita karne se inkaar kar diya or america sangheey sarkaar kaa kaamkaaj thap pad gaya
 Similar arguments were made in the UK on the need for government intervention

 The alliance promised that it would balance the national budget within five years by cutting £ 130 billion in government spending and the dismissal of 500,000 public sector workers
 german chancelar angela mercel ne jor diya ki europe main ekal karency euro ke mulya kii raksha ke liye sarkaron ko apane karj kaa bhugtan avilamb karnaa chahie or britain kii tarah kharch main baari katautee or shramikon kii chantni ke liye kathor kadam uthaane chahie
 The result of these drastic measures resulted in crisis in countries like Spain, Italy, Portugal, Ireland and Greece
 in deshon par dashakon se sarkari karj kaa vishaal boj tha
 People revolted after one strict policy was implemented
 aarthik sakhti ke khilaaf baghawat se ab tak 11 europea sarkarein gir chuki hai
 Just last week, the government of Nicolas Sarkozy in France and Lucas Papademos in Greece fell
 francisi samaajawaadee francwa holan jaise log satta main aane ke baad maang kar rahe hai ki mercel ko sakht nitiyon par punarvichaar karnaa chahie or unki jagah udaar kinsvaadi upaay apnaane chahie
 So, after the collapse of the Keynesian Renaissance and then the Hayekist 'frugal Economics', are the Keynesians once again heading for power? It seems like that only
 holan apni pehali videsh yatra ke tahat berlin jaaenge
 His high priority there would be to encourage Merkel not to insist on financial restraint throughout Europe
 unka tark hoga ki nae rojgaar ke srijan ke liye europea sangh ko kinsvaadi kaarykram par jor dena chahie
 The French President would also suggest to Merkel that her good financial position, along with the anti-inflationary option, should not be a problem
 ve britain ke anubhav kii misaal bhi de sakate hai ki jab usne apane hisaab-kitaab ko santulit karnaa shuru kiya to patari par aa rahi arthvyavastha ek baar phir mandi kaa shikaar ho gai
 They could turn to Ireland, whose 14 per cent reduction in the public sector has pushed the country towards negative growth (or a decrease in the production of goods and services)

 The growing discontent against spending cuts in Europe is closely watched by Wall Street and the White House in the US, as it could signal a presidential election stance in November
 obama ko chunauti dene vaale republican party ke mit romani bhi mercel kii tarah sarkari ghate or rin ke khilaaf kade kadam uthaane ke liye patibaddh hai
 But the experience of Europe shows that this kind of financial policy works in the long run and it has to pay a huge political price
 obama ab ummid kar sakate hai ki matadaataaon ko yah sandesh mil gaya he ki tii party kaa vikalp bahut kshtdaayak he
 Economic conservatives are now looking suspiciously at Holan and his Keynesian friends
 unka maananaa he ki sankat kaa saamana karne kii bajaae bazaar kii andekhi karne kii koshish kii koi tuk nahin he
 The money markets will decide whether a government is financially restrained by the interest rate on government debt
 bazaar kii andekhi karne ke liye holan ko mercel se yah kahana hoga ki european central bank ko is baat kii ijaajat di jaae ki vah europe ke khastahal bainkon ko musiibat se ubaare or vaazib daam par sarkari karj kii kharidari kare
 But Merkel has her own electoral problems
 agle saal unhen german matadaataaon ko yakeen dilaanaa hoga ki unhone europea samudaay or euro, donon kii raksha kii he
 Both of these are important for maintaining Germany's prosperity
 mercel ko german matadaataaon ko yah vishwaas bhi dilaanaa hoga ki unhone unke karj se laden dakshin europea padosiyon ko phijulkharch or asanyamee vyavhaar se bachaaya he
 Since the time of the Second World War, Germany has been ready to provide financial assistance to the rest of Europe
 lekin ab vahaan yuva germanon kii nai peedi aa gai he jise apane desh ke naaji ateet kaa koi aparadhbodh nahin he
 There is growing discontent among them that their country is engaged in reviving such countries which do not work as hard as they did
 baharhaal, antim nirnay kines ke paksh main jaataa he
 In his Economic Consequences of the Peace, he predicted that after the First World War, if the victorious Allied nations were pauperized with heavy compensation from the defeated Germans, extremist politics would be born that would lead to the Second World War
 yah bhavishyavaanee bilkul sahi sabit hui
 Now the Germans have been demanding economies for at least a decade from their European partners
 vahaan charampanthi partiyon kii haal kii chunavi jeet ke saath ham us khatarnaak ruzan ke sakshya dekh rahe hai jisaki bhavishyavaanee kines ne 90 saal se bhi pehle kii thi

 Before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar is making a lot of efforts to get people belonging to scheduled castes and scheduled tribes in his court
 isi kram main nitish kumaar ne shanivaar ko 12 jatiyon ko anusuchit janajati main shaamil karne ko lekar centre sarkaar se anushansa kii
 According to the information, on the instruction of Nitish Kumar, the recommendation of the inclusion of Mallah, Nishad, Bind, Beldar, Chauaye, Partar, Khulwat, Surhiya, Godhi, Vanpar, Kewat and Nonia caste in Scheduled Tribes in the state government along with Ethnography Study Report The office has been sent to the Ministry, Central Government
 nitish kumaar ne in jatiyon ko jab anusuchit janajati main shaamil karne kii centre se baat kii thi to centre sarkaar ne unase in jatiyon kii ethnography adhyayan report ke saath apni anushansa bhejne ke liye kaha tha
 On the demand of the central government, the Bihar government recently conducted an ethnographic study in relation to all these castes from Anugraha Narayan Singh Institute of Social Studies, Patna
 gauratlab he, pichley dinon nitish sarkaar main anusuchit jati or anusuchit janajati ke chaatr jo UPSC yaa phir BPSC kii praarambhik pariksha paas karte hai unako protsaahit karne ke liye 1 lakh rupee or 50 hajaar rupee kii protsaahan raashi dene kaa bhi elaan kiya he
 The Bihar government's move is also being seen by Nitish Kumar as an attempt to woo SC and ST voters
 isi bich anusuchit jati or anusuchit janajati karmchaariyon ke liye pramotion main aarakshan ko lekar bihar sarkaar somvaar ko supreme court main yachika daayar karne ja rahi he
 Significantly, Nitish Kumar is in favor of giving reservation to scheduled caste and scheduled tribe employees in promotion
 5 june kosupreme courtne jis tareeke se centre sarkaar ko raahat dete hue kaha tha ki anusuchit jati or anusuchit janajati ke karmchaariyon ko pramotion main aarakshan dene ke maamle main jab tak antim faisla samvidhan peeth dwaara nahin sunaaya jaataa he tab tak vah chaahe to in karmchaariyon ko pramotion main aarakshan de sakati he
 In the light of this decision of the Supreme Court, the Government of Bihar has also decided to file a petition in the Supreme Court to provide reservation in promotion to scheduled caste and scheduled tribe employees in Bihar
 agar data nae daur kaa tel he to haal ke dinon main bharat main is tel kaa upyog petrol bam kii tarah hua he
 Believing rumors circulating on popular messaging app whatsapp about child-stealers, the crowd broke down armed with sticks, sticks, brick and stones and took the lives of more than 30 people across the country
 maare gaye logon main samaaj ke haashie par khadey log, samaaj kaa sabase kamjor tabaka, pravasi majdoor or bhikhaari the to kuch aam rahgeer bhi jo rasta poochne ko ruke the
 Between the two events, you will get to see thousands of kilometers of distance, but the tendency of the crowd will look the same
 har ghatana main bahari logon par shaq kiya gaya or hamale hue jisamen kai logon kii jaan chali gai or kai darjan log to maut se bal-bal bache
 People showing vandalism like medieval era terrorists are equipped with modern technology smartphones of this era
 isse zyada virodhabhas or kya ho saktaa he
 End-to-end encryption of whatsapp is a powerful tool to ensure the confidentiality of communication
 plateform kaa daawa he ki yah massej ko apane paas surakshit karke nahin rakhata
 This simply means that there will not be a problem of profile for whatsapp users like it did with its parent company Facebook earlier this year
 durbhagyavash is plateform main maujuud video ke aasaani se share karne kii suvidha, aapattijanak saamagree banane yaa share karne vaale vyakti kii gopneeyata jaise feechar updraviyon ke liye vardaan sabit ho rahe hai or ve sampradayik nafrat failaane ke liye iskaa istemaal kar rahe hai
 The distorted photographs of 'muslims' in the post demanding the release of the accused of rape victim in Mandsaur or the statement of the newly elected MP of Kairana in Uttar Pradesh in the name of propaganda, are all direct examples of this
 gumnami ke is gun ne whotsap ko ek khatarnaak hathiyaar main badal diya he
 a weapon which in military language can be called a weapon of information warfare
 jaahir he iskaa istemaal samaaj main araajaktaa failaane ke liye hoga
 These covert issues are outlined in the cover story prepared by executive editor Sandeep Unnithan with input from the bureau
 whotsap itani aasaani se apni jimmedaariyon se pallaa nahin jhaad saktaa
 More than 200 million Indians are using it and it is its largest consumer category but surprisingly it does not even have a representative of the company in India
 hinsa kii ghatana ko kareeb ek maheenaa hone ko he par afvaahon ko rokane se jude un suraksha ficharon kii abhi pratiksha hi he jiske bare main whotsap ne khud kaha tha ki ve lekar aa rahe hai
 Speaking at the recent Global Editors Network Summit in Lisbon, i would like to reiterate what i said while speaking on the subject of rumors, that big players like technology like Facebook and Google are also big to prevent the misinformation from being disseminated
 Responsibilities have to be taken
 ve khud ko mahaj ek plateform maanate hai
 They are not just a platform, they are publishers
 agar main kisi apmanjanak saamagree ko doharaata hum, to main bhi utana hi javabdeh hum jitna us saamagree ko taiyaar karne vaala vyakti
 The government too has slammed whatsapp recently, but can any state shirk its responsibility to maintain law and order which is their responsibility established by law? These incidents of violence have exposed our policing , Especially in semi-urban areas where the highest incidence of mob violence has occurred
 bharat duniya ke un deshon main he jahaan jansankhya ke anupaat main sabase kam polisbal maujuud he
 The UN says that at least 220 police personnel should be available for a population of one lakh, whereas in India there are only 137 policemen per one lakh population
 pashavik pravriti vaale log police kii isi kami or bheed kii aad main bharat main hatyaein kar rahe hai or kanoon ab tak is bheedtantr kii krurta ko ek alag aparaadh ke rup main dekhne ko raji nahin he
 We also raised these issues a year ago in our cover story (bloodthirsty orgy, 26 July 2017) when at least 50 cases of mob violence came to light within three years, most of them beef and Swayambhu watchmen carried out against cattle traders
 yah kitni niraashajanak baat he ki ek saal baad bhi us mudde kii padtaal kii jarurat jas kii tas he
 We, smartphone users, are also part of this problem
 hamane kitni baar kisi apmanjanak saamagree ko bina uski vishwasaneeyata kii jaanch-parakh kiye aage bhej diya hoga
 We wondered what could be the effect of this action of ours? People would start trusting trusted brands for news, not any unproven information dripping into their smartphones
 yaad rakhen har sandesh jo aapako miltaa he vah samachar nahin he or agali baar koi aisi jaankaree mili jis par sahaj vishwaas na hota he to samajhie ki aapaki ashanka thik he
 Let us prevent a facility from becoming a weapon
