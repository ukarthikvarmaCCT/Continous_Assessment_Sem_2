 Returns again to Vasundhara Raje's affidavit
 lalit modi khuleam twit kar rahe hai ki unke handle par dastauez hai
 This affidavit is signed by Vasundhara Raje
 isamen vasundhara raaje ne jo likhaa he wo na sirf vasundhara balki ab pradhanmantri kii chuppi par or bhi gaharaa sawaal karata he
 The comments vasundhara ne likhaa he ki 2008 ke vidhansabha chunaav main congress party ne mere or lalit ke kilaaf kaaphi kuprachaar chalaaya tha
 He made many unwarranted allegations of corruption on both of us during my Chief Minister's term
 lekin tab tak lalit modi kaa naam bharat ke ghar ghar main mashhoor ho chukaa tha balki duniya kaa khel jagat jaanane laga tha
 After the great success of IPL, Lalit's success was not digested by the old people of the cricket world and the leaders of the Congress Party
 tab tak lalit ko anti congress or pro bijepi ke rup main bataaya jane laga tha
 Lalit Modi is tweeting from outside that a trio of Arun Jaitley, Ahmed Patel and Rajeev Shukla have gathered against me
 lalit modi ne ek or twit kiya he ki aisa lagata he ki ek channel ne paise dekar dacument nikalwaaye hai
 Vasundhara gave this affidavit to Lalit Modi for taking up the residency in London
 tab jab bharat kaa pravartan nideshaalay lalit modi kii talash kar rahaa tha
 Will the BJP or Modi government still defend Vasundhara Raje
 congress ne bhi deree nahin kii
 He did exactly the same as in the coal and commonwealth scams
 bijepi raat biraat press conference karti thi
 Now Congress is doing it and asking for resignation
 istipha demand main he
 Rajnath says that it is not UPA, it is NDA
 istipha nahin hota he
 Today, a Delhi court accepted the plea regarding information about the degree of HRD Minister Smriti Irani in the affidavit
 yachika hi sweekaar kii lekin aam aadmi party or congress ne turant smriti irani se istipha maang diya
 The controversy over the degree of Union Human Resource Minister Smriti Irani precedes the arrest of Aam Aadmi Party MLA Jitendra Singh Tomar, who is roaming the jail
 lekin jis tarah se jitendra singh tomars kii giraftaar hui, farzi degree yaa vivaadit degree ke maamle kaa sandarbh badalata ja rahaa he
 The degree of a minister from Maharashtra is also in dispute
 2004 main loksabhaa kaa chunaav ladate vakt smriti irani ne apane halafname main bataaya ki unhone 1996 main dilli vishvavidhyalay ke patrachaar vidhyalay se bie paas kiya he, 2011 main rajyasabha kaa chunaav ladiin to bie commers part van bataaya
 The 2014 affidavit stated that he has done b
com Part One from the School of Open Learning of Delhi University
 dilli kii patiala house adaalat ne is maamle par sunwaayee kii manzuri de di he
 There will be a hearing on August 28, the hearing may go on for several days, do not think that the decision will come on that day
 mahatvapurn baat yah he ki 2004 kaa maamla hone ke baad bhi adaalat ne ise purana nahin mana or sunwaayee ke liye sweekaar kar liya
 Therefore, before the summons, there will be a hearing in which only the accused has to prove it by bringing all the evidence
 uske baad smriti irani ko trial main pesh hona padegaa
 Keep in mind the court has only asked the accused to prove it by bringing evidence
 kisi tarah kaa koi faisla nahin diya he
 On May 26, 16 days before he was sworn in as Union Minister, the Supreme Court gave a verdict in the Maharashtra case
 thane zile ke vidhayak kishan shankar kathore ne oktober 2004 ke apane halfmane main bakaayaa bijli bill, patni ke naam bangala or share kii jaankaree nahin di
 Mr
 Kathore lost first in the High Court and then in the Supreme Court
 unki sadsyta chali gai
 The verdict exists on the Internet in the name of Kishal Shankar Kathore vs Dattatreya Sawant
 supreme court ne kaha ki aise maamalon main jab yah sabit ho jaataa he ki jaankaree nahin di gai yaa galat jaankaree di gai yaa puri jaankaree nahin di to mana jayega ki namakan sahi tareeke se sweekaar nahin kiya gaya
 While arguing on behalf of the Election Commission, Meenakshi Arora has rightly said that such an inquiry can only be done later
 agar pehle pataa chal jaataa he ki halafname main galat jaankaree di he to wo chunaav nahin lard saktaa is lihaaz se agar baad main pataa chalata he to uskaa chunaav radd ho saktaa he
 Even at the time of filing nomination, there is a decision of the Supreme Court about not giving information in the affidavit and leaving a blank space
 2013 ke risergence india banaam chunaav ayog maamle main faisla diya gaya tha ki khaali sthaan chhodane par sadsyta ja sakati he
 The same allegation about Prime Minister Narendra Modi's affidavit in the 2012 Assembly was that the married column was not filled there
 2014 ke halafname main vivaahit likhaa gaya tha
 This case is going on in the Gujarat High Court

 There is no resignation
 aaj dilli kii ek adaalat ne halafname main maanav sansaadhan mantri smriti irani kii degree kii jaankaree ke bare main yachika sweekaar kar lee
 The petition was accepted but the Aam Aadmi Party and Congress immediately demanded the resignation of Smriti Irani
 kendriya maanav sansaadhan mantri smriti irani kii degree kaa vivaad jail jail gum rahe aam aadmi party ke vidhayak jitendra singh tomars ke pakade jane se pehle kaa he
 But the way Jitendra Singh Tomar was arrested, the reference to the case of fake degree or disputed degree is changing
 maharashtra se bhi ek mantri kii degree vivaadon main he
 Smriti Irani, while contesting the Lok Sabha elections in 2004, stated in her affidavit that she passed her BA from the correspondence school of Delhi University in 1996, contested the Rajya Sabha elections in 2011 and said BA Commerce Part One
 2014 ke halafname main kaha ki dilli vishvavidhyalay ke skool of open larning se bikom part van kiya he
 The Patiala House court of Delhi has approved the hearing on this matter
 28 agast ko sunwaayee hogi, sunwaayee kai din chal sakati he, yah na samajhiye ki us din faisla aane vaala he
 Importantly, even after the 2004 case, the court did not consider it outdated and accepted for hearing
 isliye ab saman dene ke pehle kii sunwaayee hogi jisamen aarope lagane vaale ko hi saare saboot laakar sabit karnaa hoga
 After that Smriti Irani will have to appear in the trial
 dhyaan rahe adaalat ne sirf aaropee ko saboot laakar sabit karne ke liye kaha he
 Has not given any decision
 26 may ko kendriya mantri ke rup main shapath lene se 16 din pehle supreme court ne maharashtra ke maamle main ek faisla diya tha
 Thane district MLA Kishan Shankar Kathore, in his October 2004 affidavit, did not provide details of the outstanding electricity bill, bungalow and share in wife's name
 kathore sahab pehle hoicourt main haare phir supreme court main
 His membership was gone

 The Supreme Court said that in such cases, when it is proved that information was not given or incorrect information was given or complete information was not given, it would be presumed that the nomination was not accepted correctly
 chunaav ayog kii taraf se bahes karte hue minakshi aroda ne sahi kaha he ki aisi jaanch to baad main hi sakati he
 If it is found out earlier that the wrong information is given in the affidavit, then he cannot contest the election, so if he finds out later, his election can be canceled
 yahaan tak ki namakan bharte samay halafname main jaankaree nahin dene or khaali sthaan chhod dene ke bare main supreme court kaa ek faisla he
 In the 2013 case of Resurgence India v
 Election Commission, a decision was given that membership could be allowed if left vacant

 The Supreme Court dismissed Subramanian Swamy's petition
 unki maang thi ki chunaav ayog sonia gandhi ke khilaaf shikaayat darj kare
 According to Swamy, in 2004, Sonia Gandhi misinformed about her educational qualification
 do jajon kii bench ne kaha tha ki sonia gandhi ne jaankaree nahin chhipaai ki unhone cambries vishvavidyadalay ke lenaaks kook skool se angreji main certificate course kiya tha
 Swamy claimed that Sonia Gandhi University had never registered in that institution
 laut kar aate hai phir se vasundhara raaje ke halafname kii ore
 Lalit Modi is openly tweeting that he has documents on his handle
 is halafname main vasundhara raaje ke dastakhat hai
 In this, what Vasundhara Raje has written, not only Vasundhara but now also questions the Prime Minister's silence even deeper
 tippaniyan Vasundhara has written that in the 2008 assembly elections, the Congress party had run a lot of misinformation against me and Lalit
 unhone mere mukhyamantri kaal ke dauraan ham donon par bhrashtachar ke kai bebuniyaad aarope lagaae
 But by then Lalit Modi's name had become famous in the house of India, but rather the world of the world had come to know
 ipel kii shandaar kamyaabi ke baad lalit kii safalataa ko cricket jagat ke puraane log or congress party ke netaa pachaa nahin paae
 By then Lalit was being touted as anti-congress and pro-bjp

 According to Swamy, in 2004, Sonia Gandhi misinformed about her educational qualification
 do jajon kii bench ne kaha tha ki sonia gandhi ne jaankaree nahin chhipaai ki unhone cambries vishvavidyadalay ke lenaaks kook skool se angreji main certificate course kiya tha

 Lalit Modi is openly tweeting that he has documents on his handle

 In this, what Vasundhara Raje has written, not only Vasundhara but now also questions the Prime Minister's silence even deeper
 tippaniyan Vasundhara has written that in the 2008 assembly elections, the Congress party had run a lot of misinformation against me and Lalit
 unhone mere mukhyamantri kaal ke dauraan ham donon par bhrashtachar ke kai bebuniyaad aarope lagaae
 But by then Lalit Modi's name had become famous in the house of India, but rather the world of the world had come to know

 By then Lalit was being touted as anti-congress and pro-bjp

 Lalit Modi has tweeted another that it seems that a channel has released documents by paying money

 In the 2013 case of Resurgence India v

 His demand was that the Election Commission should file a complaint against Sonia Gandhi
 swami ke anusaar 2004 main sonia gandhi ne apni shaikshanik yogyata ke bare main galat jaankaree di thi
 The two-judge bench had said that Sonia Gandhi did not hide information that she had done a certificate course in English from the Lenox Cook School of Cambridges University

 The heated debate in Parliament reached the streets of West Bengal just hours after the full draft of the National Citizenship Register (NRC) was released on 30 July in Assam
 rajnatik partiyaan supreme court kii nigaraanee main chale is kaam ko turant rajnatik rang dene main lag gayi
 The legal objective of the NRC was, of course, to exclude illegal Bangladeshi migrants from the state's voter list
 bhaajapa sarkaar kaa daawa he ki ek vot bank ko baahar karne ke liye rajnatik ichhashakti kaa abhaav tha
 On the other hand, the Congress and other opposition parties say that the draft NRC that excludes 40 lakh people has flaws
 pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee kaa maananaa he ki yah bhaajapa kii sajeesh he
 He warned of partition and a situation of 'civil war and bloodshed', saying, "it is a plan to expel Bangladeshi people and Biharis
" ’’ unhone draft enarasi se baahar hue 40 lakh logon ko apane rajya main sharan lene kaa nyauta diya
 The BJP responded by saying that crores of intruders would be driven out in Bengal in the same way
 2005 main banerjee ne khud loksabhaa main avaidh bangladeshi pravaasiyon kaa mudda uthaae jane kii anumati na die jane se naaraaz hokar apane kagajaat loksabhaa adhyaksh kii taraf phenk die the
 However, contrary to his claims of religious and linguistic revenge, there are a lot of reports from many areas of Assam in which the original inhabitants and tribals have been excluded from the NRC
 unamem se bahut-se log hindu hai
 "in Muslim-majority districts like Dhubri and Hailakandi, only five per cent people have been excluded from the NRC," says an official involved in the process
 
 
 lekin dibrugarh jaise asamiya bahul jilon, yaa carbi anglong jaise adivasee bahul jilon main baahar kiye gaye logon kaa pratishat kahin zyada he

 Meanwhile, former Assam Chief Minister and veteran Congress leader Tarun Gogoi says that nrc's idea was his while party president Rahul Gandhi says that "upa's initiative of NRC to fulfill promises of Assam Accord (1985) Had
 lekin bhaajapa sarkaar ne jis tarah ise anjaam diya he, vah asantoshjanak he
 "but very few people believe this thing of Congress in Assam
 zyaadaatar logon kaa kahana he ki congress kii ‘tushtikaran kii raajnneeti’ ke kaaran hi sthiti kaabo se baahar ho gai thi
 Guilahati political analyst Dilip Chandan says, "during the Emergency, Congress President Devakant Barua adopted the policy of 'ali (muslim), Kuli (tea tribal) and Bengali' for votes and helped millions of Bangladeshi infiltrators settle in Assam

 However, contrary to its own views on the issue of illegal migrants, the BJP wants to ease the path of granting citizenship to Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian migrants from Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Pakistan and living in India
 2016 main bhaajapa in avaidh pravaasiyon ko naagarikta dilaane ke liye naagarikta kanoon, 1955 main sanshodhan karana chaahati thi
 If these amendments are passed, illegal migrants from Bangladesh who have settled in Assam, who have not found a place in the NRC, will get citizenship
 bhaajapa kahati he ki ye sanshodhan assam kii hindu pahchaan kii raksha karenge, lekin vah shaayad asamiya pahchaan ke asli mudde ko bhul gai
 There is a fear among the people of Assam about the domination of the culture of Bengali Hindus

 After the Narendra Modi government came to power, several steps were taken to simplify the process of granting long-term visas (ltvs) and citizenship for Hindu minorities from neighboring countries
 sarkaar ne altivi par rah rahe logon ke liye niyamon main chhot de di he, jisase ve yahaan sampatti kharid sakate hai, bainkon main khaataa khol sakate hai or pan card or aadhaar card bhi hasil kar sakate hai
 The biggest uncertainty among this entire politics is that what will happen to the 40 lakh people who are excluded from the draft NRC? On 31 July, the Supreme Court made it clear that no action can be taken against the people on the basis of NRC
 jo log baahar ho gaye hai ve 30 agast se 28 sitambar ke bich apana daawa or apni aapattiyaan dobaaraa daakhil kar sakate hai
 What will happen to illegal migrants who are also excluded from the final NRC list? It is impossible to send them back
 phir in naagariktavihin logon ke kya adhikaar honge? kya unhen sampatti kharidne kii ijaajat hogi? agar unhone pehle hi sampattiyaan kharid rakhi hai to uskaa kya hoga? kya unhen sarkaar kii kalyankari yojanaon kaa laabh mil paaegaa?enarasi ke prakaashan ke baad unke paidaa hone vaale bacchon kaa kya hoga? jahaan tak matdaan ke adhikaar kaa maamla he, grih mantralay kah chukaa he ki iskaa faisla chunaav ayog karegaa
 But the Chief Election Commissioner o

 Rawat says that the Election Commission is not to decide whether the people who are out of NRC will be included in the voter list
 chunaav ayog ne assam ke mukhya chunaav adhikari ko enarasi ke rajya koordinator ke saath milakar kaam karne ke liye kaha he taaki koi bhi sahi voter matadaata suchi se baahar na rah jaae
 In this process, the District Revenue Department prepares the list of voters first and the Election Commission has no role in it
 maujuuda enarasi ne march, 1971 ko apana katof banaaya he
 Thus, amnesty has been granted to the 'illegal' migrants who came to Assam before that year

 ) Targeting bjp's Chief Ministerial candidate Kiran Bedi in Delhi, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Kumar Vishwas today alleged that she (kiran Bedi) was against the attack on BJP during the Lokpal movement
 vishwaas ke is aarope par congress ne ‘aap’ kii kadi aalochana karte hue party par aarope lagaaya ki centre kii sattadhari party se uske 'kareebi rishte' hai
 Vishwas claimed that Bedi tried to influence many AAP leaders, including Kejriwal, to ensure that the alleged corruption in bjp-ruled states is not exposed
 aap netaa ne kaha, 'bhrashtachar virdohi andolan ke dauraan kuch log aise bhi the, jinaki raay thi ki bhaajapa par hamalaa nahin kiya janaa chahie
 Even after the Lokpal movement has ended, you must have heard Kiran Bedi often saying that less bad is chosen in politics
 ' Vishwas told reporters, "when AAP was not even formed, Kejriwal said in his first interview in 2012 that we had spoken to Bedi ji and he was against any attack on BJP
" ’ unhone kaha, 'koyala ghotaalaa saamne aane ke baad hamane pradhanmantri manmohan singh, congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ji ke awaas ke baahar pradarshan kiye or nitin gadakari ke ghar ke baahar bhi pradarshan kiya

 bedi se jab yah poocha gaya ki kya unhone team anna ko prabhavit karne kii koshish kii thi, is par bhaajapa netaa ne koi jawaab nahin diya
 On her praise by Shanti Bhushan, Bedi said that she has thanked him through SMS and she will meet him if possible

 Senior BJP leader Tarun Vijay has said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has proved his critics wrong in the foreign policy case
 khaskar un logon ko jinhen is mahatvapurn rashtriya suraksha ke morche par modi kii anubhavheenata ko lekar ashanka thi
 BJP leader Tarun Vijay said in Washington yesterday that in less than a year, Prime Minister Modi improved relations with India's neighbors, rapidly strengthened relations between India and the United States, established contacts with the countries of the Indian Ocean, Developed the new policy of ACT East Asia and won the hearts and minds of global leaders
 imef or vishwa bank kii vaarshik vasant baithak main bhaag lene america gaye vijay ne kaha ki modi kii videsh niti sambandhi sabhi ashankaayen evam andeh galat sabit hue hai
 Rajya Sabha member Vijay said that for the first time under the leadership of Modi, foreign policy has served the needs of domestic policy, national strategic and security interests
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar ne bahut uksaae jane ke baavjood pakistan ke saath baatcheet jari rakhi he
 Relations with other neighboring countries Bhutan, Nepal and Sri Lanka have also improved
 vijay ne ummid jataai ki modi kii china kii aagaamee yatra bhi kaaphi safal rahegeeinput: bhashaa His 'guru' examination will begin on 25 July with Pranab Mukherjee's presidential oath
 saalon se charchaa main rahe afjal guru kaa maamla raashtrapati banate hi pranab mukherjee kii mej par hoga
 The special thing is that Bal Thackeray and Pranab da's son Abhijeet Mukherjee have appealed to Pranab to take a decision in this matter
 afjal guru ko sansad hamale main supreme court se faansee kii sajaa mili he
 But his hanging case is still hanging
 haalanki pranab mukherjee ke raashtrapati chune jate hi afjal guru kaa maamla phir surkhiyon main hai
 His son Abhijeet, who came to congratulate Pranab Mukherjee, said in a special conversation with Aaj Tak that a decision should be taken on Afzal's execution soon
 isse pehle pranab ko raashtrapati pad ke liye samarthan dene vaale shivasena pramukh bal thakare ne pehla bam phoda
 Bal Thackeray has congratulated Pranab Mukherjee for victory in the Sena mouthpiece Saamana
 lekin saath hi afjal guru ko faansee dene kii maang doharaa di he
 In the confrontation, Bal Thackeray wrote that Pranab Mukherjee should reject Afzal Guru's mercy petition and sentence Afzal Guru to death
 shivasena ne pehle bhi afjal guru ko faansee die jane kii maang kii thi
 But this time the pressure is high as Pranab da is supported
 khaas baat ye he ki khud pranab mukherjee ke bete ne bhi kaha he ki afjal guru kii faansee kaa faisla latakaaya nahin janaa chahie
 That is, even before Pranab Mukherjee became the President, the question of hanging of Afzal Guru stands
 jabaki congress ne pehle hi is maamle par apana rukh saaf kar diya he
 That is why the Ministry of Home Affairs has appealed to the President to waive the execution sentence of Afzal Guru for the Parliament attack
 jaahir he ki shapath lene se pehle hi sarkaar ke sankatmochak rahe pranab da ke saamne sankat khadaa he
 That too, a crisis that saved two presidents
 ab pranab mukherjee is sankat se nipatane ke liye koun si sanjivani booti laaenge is par puure desh kii nigaah rahegi
 The Kejriwal government is training to protect the sanitation workers from sewer deaths in Delhi
 siem kejariwal ne har sarkari or privet safai karmchaaree ko sarkaar dwaara suraksha kit dene kaa elaan kiya he
 The pledge to use the safety kit has also been administered to the cleaning staff at the training program held at Talkatora Stadium on Monday
 training ke liye talkatoraa stadium main hajaaron kii sankhya main safai karmchaariyon maujuud rahe
 a video was also shown to the sanitation workers about how to use the equipment before landing in the sewer
 kaarykram ke dauraan mukhyamantri kejariwal ne dilli kii badhati aabaadi kaa zikr bhi kiya
 He said, 'people come to Delhi for many reasons, and settle here
 lekin dilli kii aabaadi tezi se bad rahi he
 Roads, sewers and blockades were not constructed with the increasing population
 hamaari pehali praathamikta he ki har ghar ko nal main pani mili
 There are many areas where 1 hour of water comes in 2 days
 hamaari koshish he ki 24 ghante nal main pine kaa pani mili or RO ke bina log pani pi saken
 'further Kejriwal said,' Today, after 4 and a half years, 80% of Delhi's sewer line has been laid
 aane vaale 2 saal main dilli ke 100% gharon siver kii vyavastha karne kaa plan he
 When the city grows, that city is unable to care for the poor
 hamaari sarkaar chaahati he ki sabakaa ek saath vikaas ho
 If there is death in the sewer, there is sorrow, it has to end
 dilli jal board puri koshish kar rahaa he
 Apart from this, Arvind Kejriwal said that the poor are the big reason behind the Aam Aadmi Party getting the maximum seats in Delhi
 unhone kaha ki garibon kii vajah se hamen 70 main se 67 seat mili thi
 After this, we increased the wages of the poor, but now the workers have to protect themselves
 safai karmchaariyon kii zimmedaari thekedaar kii to rahegi lekin ab dilli sarkaar ek sefti kit safai karmchaaree ko muft main degi
 At times, the cleaning workers are negligent
 aaj safai karmchaaree kasam khaaen ki bina sefti kit ke siver main nahi utrenge
 Let us tell you that the Kejriwal government of Delhi has also launched machines for sewer cleaning, so that the employees can be saved from death in the sewer
 aise main safai karmchaariyon ko kit baantne ke makasad par bhi sawaal khadey hote hai
 However, Delhi Jal Board believes that it is difficult to reach machines in many places, in such a situation it is necessary to train government and private employees

 mumbai aatankwaadi hamalon kii pehali barsi se purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne kaha he ki unhen har din khufia report mil rahi hai jinamein sanket miltaa he ki pakistan sthit aatankwaadi sanghathan mumbai kii tarj par bharat par or hamalon kii yojana bana rahe hai
 Describing Pakistan's move to use terrorism as a state policy "tragic", Singh has said that India is ready to deal with all the pending issues with it on the condition that it is engaged in terrorist activities against its neighbor
 Will not let us use our land
 pakistan pryojit aatankwaad se peedit rahaa he bharalmerica yatra se pehle washington post ke saath saakshaatkaar main singh ne kaha ki pakistan pryojit aatakamvaad se bharat peedit rahaa he or khufia report ab bhi sanket detii hai ki pakistan sthit aatankwaadi sanghathan beete saal mumbai hamalon ke jaise hamale dobaaraa karne kii yojana bana rahe hai
 In it Singh has said, "every day i get intelligence reports that Pakistan-based terrorist organizations are planning to carry out attacks similar to Mumbai attacks
 ’’ singh ne is baat par jor diya ki pakistan ko bharat se ‘darane kii jarurat nahin hai’ or yah ‘‘dukhad’’ he ki aisi naubat aa gai he ki ‘‘rajkeey niti ke saadhan’’ ke rup main pakistan aatankwaad kaa istemaal kar rahaa he
 "we are committed to resolve all pending matters with Pakistan through bilateral negotiations," he said
 hamaari ekmaatr shart yah he ki bharat ke khilaaf aatankwaadi gatividhiyon ke liye pakistan ko apni sarajameen kaa istemaal karne kii aatankwaadiyon ko ijaajat nahin deni chahie
 "using its influence on Pakistan, America said," If Pakistan truly respects this commitment, then we can return to the negotiating table and resolve all the pending issues between us
 ’’ singh ne is tathy kaa ullekh kiya ki ‘‘pakistan pryojit aatankwaad’’ se bharat lagbhag 25 varshon se peedit rahaa he
 Singh will arrive in Washington next Tuesday and this interview will be published in the Sunday edition of the Washington Post of the same day
 singh ne kaha ki bharat chahta he ki america apane tamaam prabhaavon kaa istemaal karte hue pakistan se is raste ko chhodane ke liye kahe
 Asked about the steps taken by Pakistan to arrest those involved in the Mumbai attacks, Singh said he had not taken enough steps
 singh ne kaha, ‘‘jahaan tak mumbai narsanhaar kii sajeesh rachane waalon kaa sawaal he, pakistan ne kuch kadam uthaae hai lekin yah paryaapt nahin hai
 Singh also expressed concern over the rising terrorism in Pakistan and said that terrorists are strengthening their hold on many parts of Pakistan which is also a threat to India's security
 afghanistan main america-paak ke makasad main farkaunhone kaha, ‘‘ateet main pakistan ke phata kshetra main simit rahe taliban or alqaida jaise aatankwaadi sanghathan ab yadi pakistan kii mukhya bhoomi par aate hai to mujhe lagata he ki hamaari suraksha par iskaa gambhir asar padataa he
 "singh said," We would not like terrorism to create a situation in which a civilian government remains a nominal government
 ’’ washington post ke saath saakshaatkaar main singh ne kaha ki afghanistan main america or pakistan ke makasad main fark prathit hote hai or unhen nahin lagata he ki aatankwaad ke khilaaf yuddh main pakistan puri tarah se samarpit he
 Singh said, "as far as Afghanistan is concerned, i cannot say for sure that the objectives of America and Pakistan are the same
" ’’afaganistan ko niyantran main rakhana chahta he pakistanunhone kaha ki pakistan chahega ki america afghanistan se jald chalaa jaae, vahiin america kaa makasad yah he ki pakistan taliban se nipatane par apana dhyaan kendrit kare
 Singh said, "pakistan would like Afghanistan to be under its control, i do not think that Pakistan is wholeheartedly supporting the action against Taliban in Afghanistan
" ’’ unhone kaha, ‘‘beshak pakistan taliban ke khilaaf karrwai kar rahaa he, lekin yah karrwai tabhi hoti he jab sena kii sarvocchata ke liye taliban khatra banataa he
 Hoping to continue the involvement of the US and the world community in Afghanistan, Singh said that the Taliban victory would have "disastrous consequences" on the world, especially for South Asia and West Asia
 singh ne kaha, ‘‘hamaari chintaaen ni:andeh zyada apaat hai
 We have suffered from terrorism and the extreme ideologies that the Taliban represent
 yadi ise roka nahin gaya to yah hamaare desh ko asthir kar saktaa he
 Reacting to a question about the Al Qaeda and the Taliban being in the same bag, Singh said that Al Qaeda and the Taliban are the same things
 singh is baat par sahamat hue ki afghanistan ke raashtrapati hamid karaji kaa shasankaal ‘parfect’ nahin he
 Singh told the international community that he followed Karzai as he was re-elected president
 unhone kaha, ‘‘raashtrapati karaji kaa shasankaal ‘parfect’ nahin he
 But you cannot rejuvenate Afghanistan overnight
 isamen lanbaa samay lagegaa
 The way the West perceives democracy, it cannot begin in the short term in Afghanistan
 ’’ singh ne kaha, ‘‘lekin bada tathy yah he ki afghanistan ke lakhon bachche or ladkiyaan ab skool ja rahe hai
 When no one went to school, the Taliban was powerful
 isse maanav kii swatantraaa najar aati he
 Everyone needs to form a balanced opinion
 ’’ Housefull 4 Movie Review: Akshay Kumar, Bobby Deol, Ritesh Deshmukh, Kriti Sanon, Kriti Kharbanda, Pooja Hegde, Chunky Pandey and 'housefull 4' 'big Packet Chhota Dhamaal' comes out despite a lot of stars
 'housephul 4' kii kahani 1419 ke sitamgarh kii he, jahaan akshay, bobi, ritesh, kriti, puja or kriti ek duusare se pyaar karte hai, lekin kuch vajahon se donon juda ho jate hai
 Six hundred years later, the three reincarnate, and then resume, houseful type confusions
 couples kaa miss match or ek ke baad ek dher saare chemiyo
 Overall, Housefull 4 has been tried on the lines of the first three parts
 kahani behad kamjor he
 The jokes of force are punched, and in many places even laughter does not come
 dialogs bahut hi fike hai
 Talking about acting in 'housefull 4', the film has a lot of actors and many are so absurd that they don't understand why they have been cast
 akshay kumaar hameshaa kii tarah acting main kuch zyada hi laud najar aate hai
 Ritesh Deshmukh has also been seen in such a character
 film ke baaki actor bhi kuch khaas karishma nahin kar pate hai
 Overall, an army of stars has been created on the basis of a weak and nonsensical story, due to which the foundation of the film seems to be creaking
 film kaa koi bhi actor aisa nahin he jo dil yaa dimag par apni chhap chhodkar jaataa he
 Talking about the direction of 'housefull 4', Farhad Samji has tried to make the film very weak and stand on the old concept
 film main kahani ke naam par kuch bhi nahin he
 The 'bala' song of 'housefull 4' is definitely good, but the rest of the songs are average
 diwaali ke maukey par akasar kamedi filmon ko relies kiya jaataa he, is baar "housephul 4' ai he, lekin kamedi, kahani or acting teenon hi morche par film diwaali sareekhee roshni failaane main fail rahati he
 The budget of the film is said to be around 75 crores, but due to the weekend of Diwali, 'housefull 4' can get a good opening, but the rest of its journey can be a struggle
 gujarat ke nadiad main do rais jaadon kii sharmnaak karatuut se sansani fail gai he
 Both these nobles made a girl's MMS and sent her to the whole of central Gujarat
 ab bade baap kii donon aulaaden police kii giraft main hai
 MMS accused Vishal aka Bunty Vasudev, created after sexually assaulting him, belongs to a family known for spice products
 aarope he ki vishaal apane dost annu ke saath milakar ek ladki ko bahala phusalaakar hotel main le gaya auki uskaa yon utpeedan karne ke baad ms bana daalaa
 When the police got a glimpse of this incident, they themselves took the initiative in the whole case and arrested both the accused
 khaas baat ye he ki vishaal kii maa nadiad munispality kii up pramukh rah chuki hai jabaki vishaal ke pita kaa kaarobaar 150 karod se bhi zyada kaa he
 Currently, the court has handed Vishal and his friend on police remand
 a post shared by Sapna Choudhary (@isapnachaudhary) on Aug 4, 2018 at 10:34pm PDT The price of gold in the country has recently set a new record
 philhal sone kii keemat 40,000 rupee ke paar chali gai he
 The increased price has also affected the sale of gold
 lekin kya isaki vajah se kisi jewelery shop ke karmchaaree itane khush ho sakate hai ki ve khushi se dance karne lagen, kyonki dukaan main koi graahak nahin he?kya he daavasoshal media par ek video viral ho rahaa he
 In which employees are dancing in a jewelery shop
 is video ke saath daawa kiya ja rahaa he ki sone ke daam badhane kii vajah se dukaan main koi graahak nahin he, isliye dukaan ke karmchaaree is tarah se time paas kar rahe hai
 Many face book users like "different Things" and "rama Kulkarni" etc
 have posted this video
 video ke saath capshan main likhaa he, “sone kii keemat 40,000 rupee, koi graahak nahin
 So employees are passing the time ”
 kya he sachaiindia today ke anti phek news war room (AFWA) ne apni padtaal main paaya ki yah daawa galat he
 The employees in the jewelery shop are not dancing because gold is expensive and there are no customers and they are passing time
 yah video ek saal purana he or dilli kii ek jewelery shop kaa he
 It is a regular practice in this jewelery shop that the employees here start the day every day with songs and dance to make their day happy
 hamen kaise pataa chalaa sachyah video fasebuk ke saath whatsap ortviterper bhi viral he
 In this two-minute video, it can be seen that some men and women are dancing to a song in an office uniform in a jewelery shop and the song is not in Hindi
 twitor par kai logon ne becoground main baj rahe gane ko lekar jigyaasa prakat kii he
 Some wrote that it is a famous "pahadi" song with the lyrics "chaita ki chaitwal" and it is especially popular in Uttarakhand
 hamane paaya ki yah gaanaa vaaki main “chaita ki chaitwal” hi he jo ki gadhwali bhashaa main he orutubaper maujuud he
 Some others have commented and written that this could be a store of Tanishq Jewelery
 kii-verde “chaiti ki Chaitwal Uttarakhand Tanishq” ke jariye hamane search kiya to hamen you tub to aise hi do video mili
 KISS Jewelery Shop belongs to the video "uttarakhand Pahari Video online" and "garwal villager Praveen Singh Panwar" uploaded this video on youtube on 18 September 2018
 donon ne hi video ke capshan main daawa kiya he ki yah video dilli ke conot place sthit tanishk ke showrooms kaa he
 We approached Tanishq's showroom at Connaught Place
 unhone is daawey ko khaarij kar diya ki yah video tanishk ke showrooms kaa he
 He said that “the uniform worn by the employees in the video is not from Tanishq
 ” isliye yah video tanishk ke kisi showrooms kaa nahin ho saktaa
 He hinted to us that this video may be from another famous jewelery brand "manohar Lal Jewelers"
 hamen manohar laal jewalers ke fasebuk par vahi video mila
 He recently posted this video on his Facebook page and explained in detail about the "morning routine" of his employees
 manohar laal jewalers ke offis ne hamen phone par bataaya ki viral ho rahaa video unheen kii shop main shoot kiya gaya tha
 But this claim is completely wrong that due to increase in the price of gold, customers are not coming to buy gold, so the employees are dancing for the time pass
 manohan laal jewalers ke mutabik, hamaari har shop main yah har din kaa niyamit rivaaj he ki ham din kaa kaarobaar gane or dance ke saath khushhaal dhang se shuru karte hai
 The video was shot at Manohar Lal Jewelers' store in Preet Vihar, Delhi in September last year
 nishkarshmedia kireportke mutabik, pichley 12 maheenon main sone kii keemat 30,000 se badhkar 40,000 ho gai he
 This increase in the price of gold has affected the sale of gold
 lekin viral video ke saath jo daawa kiya ja rahaa he vah puri tarah se galat he
 The video of the employees dancing in the jewelery store is old and has nothing to do with the increased gold prices

 At that time, the Sarvajan Khap Reservation Committee had threatened to launch a movement to stop the roads leading to Delhi, but the Haryana government had taken that decision before that
 haryana sarkaar pehle hi anya pichhadi jatiyon ko 27 fisadi or daliton ko 20 fisadi aarakshan de rahi thi
 After this, by giving ten percent reservation to five more communities, this reservation increased to 57 percent overall

 sankhya ke hisaab se bahut fark to nahin padaa he magar zyaadaatar jat vipaksh main aa gaye hai
 Perhaps the pain of going to power is being felt more in this segment
 yah bhi kaha jaataa he ki bijepi ke jo jat vidhayak hai ve gaiyr jaaton ke samarthan se jite hai
 But both Jat ministers of BJP are quite powerful
 captain abhimanyu ke paas 12 vibhaag hai jinamein vitt, rajasav, yojana paryaavaran or udyog shaamil hai
 Om Prakash Dhankad has 4 divisions
 krishi, pashupaalan, sinchai shaamil hai
 Abhimanyu and Dhankad hold a very important place in the Khattar cabinet
 phir bhi inke gharon par hamalaa kiya gaya
 Just as the Patel ministers' house was attacked during the Patel Reservation in Gujarat
 ab ye kaha gaya ki rohtak ko jala diya gaya kyonki jat raajnneeti kii rajdhani ke rup main uski pahchaan thi
 Let's once again look at Rohtak's political equation
 rohtak main vidhansabha kii 9 siten hai
 Maham, garhi-sampla-kiloi, Rohtak, Kalanaur, Bahadurgarh, Badli, Jhajjar, Beri, Kosli
 inamen se chaar bijepi ke paas hai or 5 congress ke paas
 Four of the current 9 mlas are Jats
 ek brahman, ek punjabi or do dalit hai, ek yadav hai
 In 2009 there were four Jats in Rohtak district
 2009 main 9 kii 9 siten congress ke paas thim
 Rohtak Lok Sabha seat is held by Deepender Hooda, who is a Jat
 kya zamin par koi gaiyr jat banaam jat kaa dhruvikaran banane kaa prayaas kar rahaa he
 What happened in Haryana was related only to the demand for reservation or to demonstrate Jat power
 jat banaam gaiyr jat ke bich dhruvikaran ko majboot karnaa tha
 There was a lot of agitation by the Patels to demand reservation, but within a few weeks the police took control
 hardik patel par police ke khilaaf logon ko uksaane or sampattiyon ko nuksaan pahunchane ke aarope main rajdroh kaa mukadmaa daayar kar diya gaya or wo kaaphi samay se jail main he
 But the Jat community's tendency towards extremism is considered different
 jat andolan kii tivrata ko dekhte hi bijepi or centre sarkaar harakat main aa gai
 The houses and shops of Punjabi and Saini Samaj have been severely attacked in Haryana
 isse donon samudaayon ke bich kii jo raajnneetik duuri badhegi uskaa laabh kis kis ko hoga is par bhi sochaa janaa chahie
 Is the Congress looking for a comeback from this or is the BJP strengthening its base, but why would the BJP do all this in its own state
 bijepi ke saansad rajkumaar saini ke bare main kaha jaataa he ki ve lagaataar jat birdari par hamale kar rahe the
 Many people are accustomed to seeing Jats as a political community
 jabaki aisa nahin he
 Due to the politics of polarization in western Uttar Pradesh, Jats joined the BJP in large numbers, and in Haryana, there has been talk of non-jat polarization against Jats
 haryana ke jat aarakshan ko dekhte hue rajasthan or pashchimi upi se bhi awaazen aane lagi hai
 If there is a mobilization in its name, it may be difficult for the BJP
 shaayad isiilie bijepi ne jat aarakshan ko lekar aashwaasan se lekar cameti banane main koi deree nahin kii
 The BJP promised that Jats would be given reservation in the very next session of the assembly
 bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne bhi venkaya naidu kii adhyakshata main ek cameti bana di he jo supreme court se khaarij na ho sake iskaa rasta nikaalegi
 Jats were given OBC status by the Congress government but the court rejected it
 yah bhi kaha ja rahaa he ki bijepi obisi ke 27 fisadi aarakshan se baahar diya ja saktaa he
 The Chief Minister of Haryana has said that Jats can be given reservation on economic grounds, but the Jat leaders rejected the proposal
 grahamantri rajnath singh ne bhi kai rajyon ke jat netaaon ko bulaakar baat kii or sabase shanti kii apil kii he
 Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu has said that this is a complex issue that we will resolve by negotiation
 hamane cameti banaai hai
 Most will discuss only then they can decide
 aaj us cameti kii pehali baithak bhi hui
 Our colleague Akhilesh Sharma has reported that the government is considering several options
 saidhantik rup se aarakshan dene ko taiyaar ho gai he lekin kaise diya jayega us par baat ho rahi he
 The first option is to give them reservation under BC (B) category which is for the farming communities
 iske tahat 11 fisadi aarakshan kaa praavdhaan he
 Another option is to give 3 percent vacant quota to Jats in Haryana
 iske liye sabhi dalon kii sahmati hasil kii jaaegi
 Till the Jats do not get reservation in the state, they will not get it at the center
 isliye march ke tisare hafte main haryana vidhansabha main bill laayaa jayega
 The comments march 2015 main jat pratinidhimandal pradhanmantri se mila tha
 It consisted of 70 representatives from different states
 piemo ne ek bayaan bhi jari kiya tha jisamen kaha tha ki pradhanmantri ne unke muddon ko dhyaan se suna he
 The government is currently reading the decision of the Supreme Court and will try to find a solution under the legal framework
 farvari 2016 main itani hinsa ke baad ek cameti bani he
 Meanwhile, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat today said that a committee of non-political people should be formed to decide the eligibility for reservation

 The goods train was set on fire near Sonipat on Monday
 rail sampattiyon ko kaaphi nuksaan pahunchaaya gaya he
 More than 800 trains have been affected
 6 railway steshnon ko nuksaan pahunchaa he
 The railway has suffered a financial loss of 200 crores in this violence
 2 mantriyon ke ghar main todphod hui he
 The house of Geeta Bhukkal, the MLA of Jhajjar, was also burnt
 jhajjar main sinchai vibhaag main bhi aag lagaai gai
 Government dispensaries and bus depots in Jind, Hisar, Sonepat have also been attacked
 sonipat main congress vidhayak jagabir singh malik ke ghar par patharav, unki teen dukaanon ko bhi jalaayaa gaya
 All this continued when the army was called
 sena ke 49 kollam tainaat kiye gaye
 52 companies of paramilitary forces were launched
 sadaken band thim to sabko helicopter ke zariye jagah jagah utaara gaya
 Hundreds of laborers working in Sonipat, Rohtak and Panipat somehow managed to escape from there

 march 2014 main upie sarkaar ne aam chunaavon se thik pehle ek notification jari kar jaaton ko obisi darja dene kaa faisla kiya
 Under this, the people of Jat community of nine states of North India were to benefit
 17 march, 2015 ko supreme court ne jaaton ko obisi darja dene se judaa notification khaarij kar diya
 On February 16 of the same month, the Supreme Court also dismissed a petition for reconsideration of its decision to dismiss the notification
 26 march, 2015 yani pichley saal pradhanmantri narendra modi khap panchayaton ke pratinidhiyon or jat netaaon se mili or obisi aarakshan kii unki maang kaa samarthan kiya
 But when no action was taken on this assurance, the All India Jat Reservation Struggle Committee (AIJASS) resumed its agitation for reservation
 haryana main lagaataar 18 saal tak jat hi mukhyamantri rahaa
 For the first time after 18 years, a non-jat has become the Chief Minister
 manohar laal khatter
 The percentage of Jats in the state is 27-28
 haryana kii 90 vidhansabha siton main se is vakt 47 bijepi ke paas, 19 inelo ke paas or congress ke paas 15 vidhayak hai
 There are two Jat ministers in the Khattar cabinet
 captain abhimanyu or om prakaash dhanakad
 bjp's state president is also a Jat
 Subhash Barwala
 bijepi ke paas chah jat vidhayak hai
 Haryana Congress state president Ashok Tanwar is a Dalit
 congress ke paas 11 jat vidhayak hai
 That is, the Congress has more Jat mlas
 haryana main yah pehali baar hua he ki vipaksh main jat vidhayak zyada he varna vahaan sattadhari dal main hi jat vidhayak zyada hua karte the
 BJP has 6 Jat mlas and Congress has 11

 This is the first time in Haryana that Jat mlas are more in opposition or else there were more Jat mlas in the ruling party

 At the time when Om Prakash Chautala was the Chief Minister, the number of Jat mlas increased to 30
 devilal ke samay 24 hi thi
 The previous assembly had 27–28 Jats

 There has not been much difference in terms of numbers, but most Jats have come in opposition

 Nevertheless their houses were attacked

 It was now said that Rohtak was burnt because it was identified as the capital of Jat politics
 ek baar phir se rohtak ke raajnneetik sameekaran ko dekh lete hai
 There are 9 assembly seats in Rohtak

 Is anyone trying to create a polarization of non-jat versus Jat on the ground
 haryana main jo kuch hua kya uskaa sambandh sirf aarakshan kii maang se tha yaa jat shakti kaa pradarshan karnaa bhi tha
 The polarization between Jat vs non Jat was to be strengthened

 BJP MP Rajkumar Saini is said to have been continuously attacking the Jat fraternity

 In view of Haryana's Jat reservation, voices have also started coming from Rajasthan and western UP
 agar iske naam par golbandi hui to bijepi ke liye mushkil ho sakati he
 Perhaps that is why the BJP did not delay the formation of a committee from assurance on Jat reservation
 bijepi ne vaada kar diya ki vidhansabha ke agle hi satr main jaaton ko aarakshan de diya jayega
 BJP President Amit Shah has also formed a committee under the chairmanship of Venkaya Naidu which will find its way out of the Supreme Court

 It is also being said that 27 per cent of the BJP OBC reservation can be given out
 haryana ke mukhyamantri ne kaha he ki jaaton ko aarthik aadhaar par aarakshan diya ja saktaa he lekin jat netaaon ne is prastaav ko thukraa diya
 Home Minister Rajnath Singh also called and talked to Jat leaders of many states and appealed for the most peace
 kendriya mantri venkaiya naidu ne kaha he ki yah ek jatil masalaa he ham baatcheet se hal karenge

 Under this, there is a provision of 11 percent reservation
 doosraa vikalp he haryana main 3 pratishat khaali kota jaaton ko diya jaae
 For this the consent of all parties will be obtained
 jab tak jaaton ko rajya main aarakshan nahin milegaa, centre main nahin milegaa

 That is, the Congress has more Jat mlas
 haryana main yah pehali baar hua he ki vipaksh main jat vidhayak zyada he varna vahaan sattadhari dal main hi jat vidhayak zyada hua karte the
 BJP has 6 Jat mlas and Congress has 11

 She was only 24 at the time of Devi Lal
 pichhali vidhansabha main 27-28 jat the
 This time there are close to 26 in the assembly
 sankhya ke hisaab se bahut fark to nahin padaa he magar zyaadaatar jat vipaksh main aa gaye hai
 Perhaps the pain of going to power is being felt more in this segment
 yah bhi kaha jaataa he ki bijepi ke jo jat vidhayak hai ve gaiyr jaaton ke samarthan se jite hai
 But both Jat ministers of BJP are quite powerful

 Maham, garhi-sampla-kiloi, Rohtak, Kalanaur, Bahadurgarh, Badli, Jhajjar, Beri, Kosli
 inamen se chaar bijepi ke paas hai or 5 congress ke paas
 Four of the current 9 mlas are Jats

 There was a lot of agitation by the Patels to demand reservation, but within a few weeks the police took control
 hardik patel par police ke khilaaf logon ko uksaane or sampattiyon ko nuksaan pahunchane ke aarope main rajdroh kaa mukadmaa daayar kar diya gaya or wo kaaphi samay se jail main he

 saidhantik rup se aarakshan dene ko taiyaar ho gai he lekin kaise diya jayega us par baat ho rahi he
 The first option is to give them reservation under BC (B) category which is for the farming communities
 iske tahat 11 fisadi aarakshan kaa praavdhaan he
 Another option is to give 3 percent vacant quota to Jats in Haryana
 iske liye sabhi dalon kii sahmati hasil kii jaaegi

 Nevertheless their houses were attacked
 thik usee tarah jaise gujarat main patel aarakshan ke samay patel mantriyon ke ghar par hamalaa kiya gaya tha
 It was now said that Rohtak was burnt because it was identified as the capital of Jat politics
 ek baar phir se rohtak ke raajnneetik sameekaran ko dekh lete hai
 There are 9 assembly seats in Rohtak
 maham, gadhi-saanpala-kiloi, rohtak, kalanur, bahadurgard, badali, jhajjar, beri, kosli
 Four of these are with BJP and 5 with Congress
 maujuuda 9 main se chaar vidhayak jat hai
 There are one Brahmin, one Punjabi and two Dalits, one Yadav
 2009 main rohtak zile main chaar jat the
 In 2009, the Congress had 9 seats out of 9
 rohtak loksabhaa kii seat deependra hooda ke paas he jo jat hai
 Is anyone trying to create a polarization of non-jat versus Jat on the ground
 haryana main jo kuch hua kya uskaa sambandh sirf aarakshan kii maang se tha yaa jat shakti kaa pradarshan karnaa bhi tha
 The polarization between Jat vs non Jat was to be strengthened
 aarakshan kii maang ko lekar patelon ne bhi khub andolan kiya lekin vahaan chand hafton main police ne kaabo kar liya
 Hardik Patel has been charged with sedition against the police for inciting people and causing damage to properties and has been in jail for a long time
 lekin jat samudaay kii ugrata kii pravriti alag maani jaati he
 Seeing the intensity of the Jat movement, the BJP and the central government swung into action
 haryana main punjabi or saini samaaj ke gharon or dukaanon par kaaphi hamalaa hua he
 The political distance between the two communities will increase, who will benefit from this, it should also be considered
 kya congress isse apni vaapasi kaa rasta dekh rahi he yaa bijepi apane aadhaar ko majboot kar rahi he lekin bijepi apni hi sarkaar vaale rajya main ye sab kyon karegi
 BJP MP Rajkumar Saini is said to have been continuously attacking the Jat fraternity
 kai log jaaton ko ek raajnneetik samudaay ke rup main dekhne ke aadi hai
 However, it is not like that
 pashchimi uttar pradesh main dhruvikaran kii raajnneeti ke kaaran jat badi sankhya main bijepi ke saath aae to haryana main jaaton ke kilaaf gair jat dhruvikaran kii baat hone lagi he
 In view of Haryana's Jat reservation, voices have also started coming from Rajasthan and western UP
 agar iske naam par golbandi hui to bijepi ke liye mushkil ho sakati he
 Perhaps that is why the BJP did not delay the formation of a committee from assurance on Jat reservation
 bijepi ne vaada kar diya ki vidhansabha ke agle hi satr main jaaton ko aarakshan de diya jayega
 BJP President Amit Shah has also formed a committee under the chairmanship of Venkaya Naidu which will find its way out of the Supreme Court
 congress sarkaar ne jaaton ko obisi kaa darja diya tha magar court ne use khaarij kar diya
 It is also being said that 27 per cent of the BJP OBC reservation can be given out
 haryana ke mukhyamantri ne kaha he ki jaaton ko aarthik aadhaar par aarakshan diya ja saktaa he lekin jat netaaon ne is prastaav ko thukraa diya
 Home Minister Rajnath Singh also called and talked to Jat leaders of many states and appealed for the most peace
 kendriya mantri venkaiya naidu ne kaha he ki yah ek jatil masalaa he ham baatcheet se hal karenge
 We have formed committees
 sabase charchaa karenge uske baad hi faisla le sakate hai
 Today the first meeting of that committee was also held
 hamaare sahyogi akhilesh sharma ne khabar di he ki sarkaar kai vikalpon par vichaar kar rahi he
 Theoretically, reservation has been agreed, but how it will be given is being discussed
 pehla vikalp he ki unhen BC(B) catagori ke tahat aarakshan diya jaae jo krishak samudaayon ke liye he
 Under this, there is a provision of 11 percent reservation
 doosraa vikalp he haryana main 3 pratishat khaali kota jaaton ko diya jaae
 For this the consent of all parties will be obtained
 jab tak jaaton ko rajya main aarakshan nahin milegaa, centre main nahin milegaa
 Therefore, the bill will be introduced in the Haryana Legislative Assembly in the third week of March

 After the campaign to boycott The Kapil Sharma Show and sonytv, there is now a demand for Boycott of Kapil Sharma on social media
 soshal media par # boycottkapilsharmashow or # unsubscribesonytv ke baad # boycottkapilsharma trend kar rahaa he
 The reason for this trend is Kapil's support to Navjot Singh Sidhu
 darasal, kapil sharma ne ek intervyuu main siddhu ko sho se nikaal jane vaali khabaron par kaha ki mujhe lagata he ki kisi ko bain karnaa or siddhu ko sho se hataanaa hal nahin he
 We have to look at the permanent solution
 kapil ne siddhu ko hataae jane ke sawaal par kaha- ''siddhu apane kaam main biji hai isliye archana puuran singh ne hamaare saath shooting kii
 Speaking on the controversy, Kapil said- "these are very small things and they can also be part of a propaganda
 mujhe lagata he ki kisi ko bain karnaa or siddhu ko sho se hataanaa hal nahin he
 We have to look at the permanent solution
 ''pulavama atake par kapil ne kaha- ''ham sarkaar ke saath hai, lekin hamen sthaayee hal kii jarurat he
 Our soldiers have been martyred in the cowardly attack in Pulwama, which should not be forgotten
 doshiyon ko kadi sajaa milani chahie
 After this statement of Kapil, users are looking very angry on social media
 kai logon kaa kahana he ki hamane kapil sharma ko doosraa mauka diya, lekin wo isamen fail ho gaye
 Someone wrote, Kapil's love for Pakistan is clearly visible

 Navjot Singh Sidhu is engulfed in controversies because of his statement on the Pulwama attack

 Reports came that he was removed and Archana Puran Singh was included in the show as a judge
 lekin is badlaav ke bare main soni channel ne koi oficial statement nahin diya
 This led to a demand for # unsubscribesonytv on social media
 is bare main jab siddhu se poocha gaya ki aap sho se kyon baahar hue to unka kahana tha, "main apane raajnneetik kamitments ko puraa karne kii vajah se 'da kapil sharma' ke kuch shoots kaa hissaa nahin rahaa tha
 i was to attend the proceedings of the Legislative Assembly

 The tussle between BJP and Shiv Sena in Maharashtra over seat sharing has attracted the attention of the entire nation
 yah isliye hairaan karne vaali baat he ki donon partiyaan dukh-sukh main hameshaa saath raheen
 The Shiv Sena always supported the BJP because of its Hindu ideology
 shivasena ke sansthaapak bala sahab thakare ne kai aise mudde uthaae jo bijepi ko pansad nahin aae lekin iske baavjood donon ke bich gathbandhan bana rahaa
 But at present, this alliance of several decades is on the verge of breakdown because the decision on seat sharing is not being done
 bijepi jitani siten maang rahi he, shivasena utani dene ko taiyaar nahin he
 It says that Shiv Sena has always been a senior partner in Maharashtra
 lekin lok sabha chunaav main apni apaar safalataa ke kaaran bijepi kaa rukh badal gaya he
 It won a total of 23 seats in the Lok Sabha elections while the Shiv Sena won only 18 seats
 isliye ab bijepi kaa kahana he ki donon partiyaan baraabar kii sthiti main hai or donon ko baraabar siten milani chahie jabaki shivasena 150 siton par adi hui he
 Due to the confrontation of these two parties, their allies are in doldrums and they are unable to say anything
 lekin kuch aisi bhi baaten hai jo shivasena ko pasand nahin aa rahi hai
 For example, bjp's claim on Mumbai's Dadar seat
 dadar kabhi shivasena kaa garh rahaa he
 In the Marathi-dominated area, she has hoisted her fame for years but lost Shiv Sena in the 2009 assembly elections
 ab bijepi chaahati he ki shiv sena yah seat unhen de de
 Apart from this, Shivsena is also angry that BJP has made fewer of its mps at the center as ministers while the promise was more
 udhar bijepi loksabhaa chunaav kii duhai de rahi he
 Apart from this, BJP is also not liking that Shiv Sena should be a contender for the post of Chief Minister
 yah uski yojana ke vipareet he
 Every big leader of the party is running according to his own
 gopinath munde ke baad party ke paas koi taqatvar netaa bhi nahin he
 However, the situation is quite tense
 ho saktaa he ki donon main aakhri kshanon main koi samjhauta ho jaae or ve milakar chunaav laden
 But the BJP has to understand a few things
 loksabhaa chunaav main apaar safalataa ko vidhansabha se nahin joda ja saktaa he
 The issues are always different in the assembly and the voters have different thinking
 bijepi ko yah kadavi sachai kaa pataa pichley dinon hue upachunaavon main chal gaya hoga
 But despite this, he has decided to contest the elections on his own by breaking the agreement with his ally in Haryana
 yah jokhim bharaa faisla he
 Both parties will suffer from this
 haryana janhit congress bhale hi rajya main ek badi takat na ho lekin uske saath milakar vah kam se kam voton ke bantwaare ko roak sakati he
 If there is no bjp-shiv Sena agreement in Maharashtra then it will be impossible for the party to form government there
 yah sahi he ki vahaan congress or ensipi main takaraar ho rahi he
 Both parties are fighting for more and more seats
 lekin un donon partiyon main kai dhurandhar raajnneetijna hai or ve janata kii nabj ko jaanate hai
 In such a situation, the BJP may get a big blow
 behatar hoga party jamini sachai ko samajhakar samjhauta kar le
 Their stubbornness can cost them dearly and shatter dreams of gaining power
 public kaa mizaaj kab badal jaae, koi nahin jaanata

 iesasahathiyaar ke dam par khun-kharaba karata he or betaar ko hathiyaar bana kar apni fouj taiyaar karata he
 This is the real game of ISIS
 or isi khel kii badaulat wo iraq or syria ke kuch shaharon main baith kar duniya ke 80 se zyada mulkon main ab tak apni paith or pahunch bana chukaa he
 ISIS has been using several apps directly from some small and big cities of Iraq and Syria in almost 80 countries of the world, if the ISIS has made its reach, the reason is Telegram, Kick, justpest
 in, naser
 Me, Manbar
 me, twitor, fasebuk, whats app, you tub, instagram ye saare eps, plateform or internet ke betaar taar hai
 This is the trap that has made ISIS the largest ji of the world
 ye wo betaar hathiyaar hai jisase duniya ko sabase zyada khatra he kyonki internet se jude inhen hathiyaaron ke jariye aies naa sirf duniya bhar ke muslim naujavaanon ko gumraah kar rahaa he balki apane tamaam aatankwaadi hamalon kii planning se lekar use amal main laane ke liye bhi istemaal kar rahaa he
 Most of these are the same apps and communication systems that are used by the whole world
 twitor se lekar fasebuk, whats app, you tub or instagram sab shaamil hai
 Actually, apart from these common computer apps, there are some social networking sites, apps and platforms on the Internet which are very difficult to get hold of
 inamen khaas taur par telegram, kik, jastapast
 Inn, Nasser
 me or maanbar
 Apps and platforms such as Me are included
 aise eps or plateform par honevaali baatcheet encripted hoti he yani pakad main nahin aati kyonki ye communication hameshaa code language main hota he
 For example, if a terrorist sitting in Syria sends a message to one of his comrades in Brussels through such apps, then the world will see this number or just a picture
 iske peeche kaa asli sandesh sirf bhejne or risive karne vaale ko hi pataa hota he
 According to experts, the terrorists of IS now have some such Android phones from which it is not possible to locate any video message on the Internet
 do roosi bhaaiyon ne banaaya app telegramsiria ke aasmaan se ye roosi bambaari aies ke thikaanon par ho rahi he
 Russia has announced the complete elimination of IS
 ittefaq dekhie ki aies jis app telegram kaa sabase zyada istemaal kar rahaa he, wo eps do roosi bhaaiyon nikolai or pavel durov kaa hi banaaya hua he
 At present, more than 62 million users of Telegram are present in the world and many ISIS terrorists are also involved
 iskaa privet chatteroom apane sabsakribers ko naa sirf duniya kii nigahon se batch kar baat karne kii aazaadee detaa he, balki isamen aap apana mobile number chipa kar bhi rakh sakate hai
 And this is what suits ISIS terrorists the most
 communication ap telegram kaa aies sabase zyada istemaal kar rahaa he
 Most of his media rallies or threats he reaches the world through this app
 iesas ne baqayda apana tele communication or madia centre bana rakhaa he
 In which IT experts from many countries of the world work
 khabaron ke mutabikbagdadike is betaar hathiyaar kaa sara kaamkaaj france main paidaa hua syrian mul kaa iti export ahamed abu samara dekhtaa he
 Propaganda Channel Launched According to the public, the way IS has launched its Propaganda channel on the social networking site in recent times, it seems like part of a disciplined army
 haal hi main aies ke ek propeganda channel ne telegram main aatankwaadiyon ke marshall art seekhney or hathiyaar chalaane kii jo tasviren or video post kii, unhen dekh kar duniya hairaan rah gai
 Actually, these things were so far ahead in terms of quality, such as this work should not be done by any terrorist organization but corporate media house
 ye darasal aies kii wo media ikai he, jo naa sirf video clips soshal cites par apadet karti he, balki arabi or angreji jaisi bhashaaon main megsine bhi chhapati he or inkaa sirf or sirf ek hi makasad he, inke jariye naujavaanon ko barglaana or unhen aies main shaamil hone ke liye uksaana
 While this company has been blocked by the increasing presence of IS on Telegram, many such platforms have been blocked, but as soon as one platform is blocked, IS terrorists create another platform under a new name
 tivetor samet duusare soshal netwarking cites par bhi aies aise hi kaam kar rahaa he
 How uncontrolled the situation has been, it can only be gauged that the remaining platforms of IS have now openly declared war in the telegram
 soshal media par 40 second kaa ek video share kiya ja rahaa he
 According to the claim, this video shows how the army officers went to the terrace of a house and carried out the brave act of snatching AK 47 from 'terrorist'
 video main dekha ja saktaa he ki ek shaks bandook haath main liye duusare terres par khadey pulisavaale se baat kar rahaa he
 Looking at the video, it seems that the policeman is trying to confuse the gunman with the things
 tabhi sada kapadon main ek shaks peeche se dabe paanv aata he or bandook vaale se bandook pakad letaa he
 Bullets run from AK 47 in Chinjhapatty
 isi bich kuch or pulisavaale bheen vahaan pahunch jate hai or bandook vaale shaks par kaabo paa lete hai
 The video has been shared in large numbers on Twitter and Facebook
 hamane jab daawey kii sachai jaanane ke liye fasebuk par search kiya to kai nattejey saamne aae
 The India Today Fact Check team found the video claim false in its investigation
 naa to bandook haath main liye khadaa shaksatankvaditha or naa hi usase bandook chhinane vaale bhartiya sena se the
 Investigation revealed that the video was from March 2012
 log uthaa rahe hai sawalvideo ke daawey kii sachai ko lekar kai net yugers ne shaq jataate hue sawaal bhi kiye
 Facebook user Arjun Majhi frz said in his comment that the video has a tail and the AK47 in his hand is not a terrorist
 hamane padtaal main paaya ki video main jo dikh rahaa he, us ghatana par times of india samet kai media houseon ne march 2012 main reporting bhi kii thi
 When we contacted our correspondent in Srinagar regarding this video, he told that this incident is six years old and belongs to Poonch district of Jammu and Kashmir
 bandook liye khadey shaks kii pahchaan sena ke jawan taahir khan ke taur par hui or jin logon ne uski pitayee kii wo sthaneey pulicekarmi the
 What the police told the police, "khan suspected his wife that he had an illicit relationship with someone
" khan gusse main aapa itnaa kho baitha tha ki apni patni ko jaan se maarna chahta tha
 He came to Poonch with a rifle and was looking for his wife
 patni to us vakt bhaagane main kaamyaab rahi thi
 But two people were killed and two others were injured in the indiscriminate firing by Khan
 sabhi tathyon ko jodne se is nattejey par pahunchaa gaya ki video main kiya gaya daawa naa sirf jhootha tha balki ye ghatana bhi chah saal puraani thi

 In teenagers, 'sexting', that is, the exchange of indecent photos and messages via phone, continues unabated
 
 
 or sirf itnaa hi nahin, ek naye adhyayan ke anusaar ye kishor pakade jane ke baad hone vaali kanoonee karravaayiyon ke bare main jaanane ke baavjood gandi, ashleel saamagree bhejne se baaj nahin aate
 
 
 Researchers at the University of Utah found in their study that about 20 percent of adolescents admitted that they had 'sexting'
 
 
 aamtaur par phone main tip kar esemes yaa text sandesh bhejne ko 'texting' kaha jaataa he, jiske aadhaar par hi yah nayaa shabd 'sexting' chalaa he
 
 
 In a study published in the journal 'archives of Sexual Behavior', the head of the research team, Donald Straussberg, said that his team surveyed 606 students from a private high school in Southwestern America and about their experiences of 'sexting' Asked
 tippaniyan He was also asked if he knew what could happen to him if caught
 
 
 is par lagbhag 20 pratishat chaatro, jinamein ladke or ladkiyaan donon hi shaamil the, ne sweekaar kiya ki vah 'sexting' karte hai
 
 
 Apart from these, on an average, 40 percent students have received such pictures on their cell phones (mobile phones) at some time
 
 
 ladakon main jahaan aisi tasviren risive karne vaale 50 pratishat the, vahiin 31 pratishat ladakiyon ne bhi ise sweekaara

 One fact of the study is very notable that about one-third of the students are aware of the legal action taken after the arrest, but still do not falter
 
 
 rajasthan ke purv mukhyamantri ashok gahalot ko congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne 26 april ko gujarat kaa prabharee mahasachiv niyukt kar diya jahaan saal ke ant main vidhansabha chunaav hone hai
 Gehlot himself could not save his kingdom four years ago, so the verdict seems unconstitutional
 unhone gurdas kaamat kii jagah lee he jo apane grih rajya maharashtra main kinare lagaae jane ko lekar naaraaz hai
 Gehlot himself is facing problems in front of Sachin Pilot who is much younger than him, who has been given the command of Rajasthan for the 2018 assembly elections
 gahalot ne bhale hi us screening cameti kii aguai kii ho jisane punjab chunaav ke liye ummidavaaron kii chantai kii thi or natijatan dashak bhar baad party vahaan kii satta main dobaaraa lauti he, lekin yah yogadan gahalot ko unki puraani haisiyat lautaane main kaam nahin aayaa
 This decision, which looks routine from above, is actually part of the new organizational strategy of Vice President Rahul Gandhi
 gahalot ahamed patel ke vafaadaar maane jate hai
 Patel, the political secretary of Sonia Gandhi, who hails from Gujarat, has a strong hold on the state's politics, hence her activism is of importance to the party
 party ke ek mahasachiv kehete hai, ''gahalot ko gujarat kaa prabharee banaakar rahul ne patel ko rajya ke liye javabdeh bana diya he
 Contrary to popular belief, Rahul is not in confrontation with the old faces of the party or close to his mother, but is taking them along
 "iske alaava pichley ek hafte main rahul ne jo niyuktiyaan kii hai, vah sanket he ki ve saal ke ant main hone vaale santhnik chunaav se pehle apni team khadi kar lenaa chaahate hai
 There is no place for old faces who do not work in this scheme
 vidambnaa yah he ki 2016 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main congress kii haar ke baad jis shaks ne sabase pehle sanghathan main ''ahm surgery" kii maang kii thi, vahi is surgery kaa shikaar ban gaya he
 Party general secretary Digvijay Singh, who was in charge of Karnataka and Goa, has been freed from both states
 karnataka main congress kii sarkaar he jahaan agle saal chunaav hone hai jabaki goa main party march main 40 main se 17 siten laakar bhi sarkaar banane se chook gai
 Digvijay may have been punished for Goa, but his removal from Karnataka is considered a surprising decision, especially because the party won the two by-elections held last month
 rahul ke kareebi sutara bataate hai ki digvijay kii bali isliye di gai taaki vidhansabha chunaav main congress ekajute hokar bhaajapa ko takkar de sake, jo bi
 s
 yediurppa kii vaapasi se utsahit he
 In the Karnataka Congress, which is battling bigotry, it was believed that Digvijay is with Chief Minister Siddaramaiah
 bhrashtachar or kharaab pradarshan ke aaropon se pehle hi ghire siddharamaiya ne pichley saal cabinet main pherbadal karke 14 mantriyon ko hataaya or 13 nae mantriyon ko jo rakhaa, vah kuprabandhan or kharaab niyojan kaa udhaaharan tha
 Digvijay had given his support to this move, so the complaints within the party came out in the open
 rahul ke kareebi ek sachiv bataate hai, ''unke khilaaf kai shikaayatein ai hai
 He did the same thing in Assam where he pitted Hemant Biswa Sarma against Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi
 "karnataka main party sanghathan ko durust karne kaa kaam ab 54 saal ke kerala se saansad ke

 All of them have previously worked with Rahul and will now support Gehlot
 congress ke sanchaar pramukh randeep ngkshasah surajevaala kehete hai, ''ve congress ke liye nai ranneeti tay kar rahe hai
 Today, Congressmen running in the age group of 30 and 40 are being given leadership roles outside their states to reinvigorate the party's policies and programs
 unhen jamini str par or kam umr ke congressi netaaon ko khojane ko kaha gaya he taaki ve block, jile or rajya str kii jimmedaariyaan sambhaal saken
 a close aide of Rahul believes that the recent appointments are indicating the emergence of new generation leaders in Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh
 agle kuch hafton main un rajyon main kuch or badlaav honge jahaan chunaav hone ko hai
 These include Madhya Pradesh where the party is divided between two potential chief ministers, Kamal Nath and Jyotiraditya Scindia
 party ne is sambandh main rajya ke prabharee mahasachiv mohan prakaash ko badalane kaa man banaaya he jo maharashtra or mumbai kaa kaam bhi dekhte hai
 If this happens, the farewell to Prakash, Digvijay and Madhusudan Mistry, who were once convinced by Rahul, are certain

 The focus of social engineering in 4-ticket distribution, trying to reach the upper castes

 vajan kam karnaa ek lambii or thakaa dene vaali prakriya he
 What people do is nothing to lose weight
 kuch dieting kaa sahaara lete hai to kuch ghanton daudte hai
 Some do yoga
 par kya aap jaanate hai bina daude-bhaage or bina dieting kiye bhi aap vajan kam kar sakate hai
 You can lose weight by taking a bath with cold water

 There are two types of fat in our body
 white fat or brown fat
 White fat is the fat that is not required
 ye fat tab jamaa ho jaataa he jab ham aavashyaktaa se adhik calories intech karte hai or ye fat bern nahin ho paata
 This white fat gets deposited on the waist, lower back, neck and thighs
 vahiin brown fat sharir ke liye acha hota he
 It works to generate heat, which keeps our body warm
 jab bhi hamen thand lagati he, brown fat sakriy ho jaataa he
 Fat starts melting when we take a bath with cold water
 jiskaa sidhaa matlab he ki aapaki badi hui charbi kam ho rahi he
 Advantages of bathing with cold water: 1
 thande pani se nahaane par blad cirkulation bad jaataa he
 Which is the fat mistake
 iske saath hi thande pani se nahaane se immune system bhi behatar hota he
 2
 thande pani se nahaane se tanaav bhi kam hota he
 3

 There were 37,58,574 voters in this election, out of which 18 lakh are women voters
 chunaav main kareeb 10,000 se zyada ummidavaar khadey hue
 These elections are important in themselves because the BJP is trying to maintain the gains in the Assembly and Lok Sabha
 udhar, dedh saal se congress ko punerjeevit karne main jute sachin payalat kii koshish he ki in chunaavon main congress khoe hue samarthan ko waapas hasil kare
 The comments ye chunaav isliye bhi dilachasp he, kyonki desh main pehali baar ummidavaaron ko shapath patr dena padaa tha ki unke ghar main shauchalay he or unke parivaar kaa koi bhi sadsy khule main shouch karne nahin jaataa he

 This election is also interesting because for the first time in the country, the candidates had to give an affidavit that there is a toilet in their house and no member of their family goes to defecate in the open
 chunaav ladane ke liye shauchalay kaa hona jaruri shart tha or chunaav ke pehle rajasthan sarkaar ne is bare main ek adhyadesh bhi jari kiya tha
 It is also necessary to have 10th pass of all the candidates
 kisi chunaav ke liye ye sab desh main pehali baar hua he
 Even in the Panchayat elections held in January, the Rajasthan government had laid down that educational qualification would be necessary to contest the elections

 The Parikrama Yatra bus of 84 Kos became a ruckus of 84 minutes
 yatra ko lekar naa viechpi kii koi taiyaari dikhti thi or naa hi upi kii sarkaar is yatra ko lekar bahut pareshaan thi
 What was shown was just an uproar
 matlab parikrama flop hui or isapar politics pehle se hi fiks thi
 When the 2014 general election came to a close, the political train in the name of Ram started running once again
 bijepi ko ram mandir yaad aa gaya to samaajawaadee party ko bijepi kaa virodh yaad aa gaya
 Ayodhya has become an arena once again
 lekin is nurakushti ko match phixing kaa naam dekar sara siyaasi khel bigaadane main jute gaye hai digvijay singh
 
 or bijepi baukhalaai hui he
 Neither was anyone surprised by the leaders of Vishwa Hindu Parishad going out on 84 Kosi Parikrama, nor seeing the batch of saintly Mahatmas running towards Ayodhya
 viechpi ke netaaon or sant mahatmaon ne vahi kiya, jo pehle se elaan kar rakhaa tha
 And the Akhilesh Yadav government of Uttar Pradesh also did what it had already announced
 ayodhya kii ore rukh karne waalon kii dhadadhad giraftaar shuru ho gai
 And as the day progressed, politics also started to heat up
 lekin tabhi congress ke netaa digvijay singh ne siyaasi chidiya uda di
 Digvijay Singh raised the question on Twitter - Is Ayodhya's match fixed? It is obvious that a few pictures were formed behind the political arrow from the Congress
 ye tasviren hai viechpi netaaon, sant mahatmaon ke saath mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav or samaajawaadee party ke mukhiya mulaayam singh yadav ke mulaakaat kii
 It has Ashok Singhal present with Mulayam and Akhilesh
 ye mulaakaat dilli main 17 agast ko hui thi
 84 Kosi parikrama were talked about in the meeting
 mulaakaat main mulaayam ne 84 kosi parikrama ko lekar koi aashwaasan nahin diya tha
 But even the intention of stopping was not expressed
 congress ne siyaasi match main phixing kaa aarope kya lagaaya
 BJP erupted
 bijepi netaa kirti aaazaad bole ki digvijay singh sathia gaye hai
 By the way, loss in political mathematics is also beneficial
 ye baat bijepi, samaajawaadee party donon hi bakhubi jaanati hai
 But in this fixing, Digvijay Singh came on the field as an umpire
 
 So the party also opened its front
 2014 chunaav kareeb he
 The bird has started flying
 siyaasi maahaul banane-bigadane lage hai
 The commotion is in full swing and the public is watching silently
 phixing bhi or chidiya bhi
 Which is sure to have an impact on democracy

 You will remember the name of nude yoga guru Vivek Mishra
 vahi vivek jo pichhali baar big bos main bhi najar aae the
 These days, he is preparing to shift to his new home in Delhi
 yah khud kaa kharida hua unka apana pehla makaan he, to is vajah se ve khaase excited bhi hai
 But let us tell you that he has not left the rented house in which he lived a few days ago
 uske peeche daraavnee kahani he
 Many strange stories were happening with him in the house of the ghost of the ghost
 vivek bataate hai, “kuch maheene pehle main ek kiraye ke flats main shift hua tha
 But there have been some incidents which have disturbed me
 ek din meri ek model dost mere saath rahane ke liye ai
 But she started behaving strangely
 uske baad meri kamwali or driver donon biimaar ho gaye
 i used to feel strange in some parts of that house
 ”vivek apane nae ghar main jald se jald janaa chaahate the lekin har baar koi baadha paidaa ho jaati thi
 Vivek explains, “I was delayed in moving to a new place due to the delay in registration with the court
 lekin mujhe is baat kaa puraa bharosa tha ki yah jo bhi takat he jo puraane ghar main mere khilaaf kaam kar rahi thi, vah chaahati thi ki main yahaan se chalaa jaaun
 "let Vivek have whatever power, but if life is saved, we get millions
" bahujan samaaj party kii adhyaksh mayawati ne chand din pehle tak apane gathbandhan sahyogi rahe samaajawaadee party ke adhyaksh akhilesh yadav par musalamaanon ko tikat dene se manaa karne kaa aarope lagaaya he
 Mayawati has said that Akhilesh sent me a message not to give too many tickets to Muslims
 iske peeche dharmik aadhaar par voton kaa dhruvikaran hone kaa tark diya gaya
 Although i did not listen to them
 mayawati ke is bayaan se desh ke sabase bade soobe uttar pradesh kii siyasat main musalmaan siyaasi vimarsh ke centre main aa gaye hai
 The Samajwadi Party, which has been calling itself Muslim friendly, has come under the scanner
 sawaal uthne lage hai ki kya sapa vastav main desh kii loktantric vyavastha main musalamaanon kii bhagidaari kii virdohi he? sapa ke adhyaksh ne aakhir mayawati se musalamaanon ko zyada tikat na dene ke liye kyon kaha, siyaasi galiyaaron main ise lekar charchaa shuru ho gai he
 Along with the people associated with politics, political knowledge and non-political persons are also interpreting this statement of the BSP supremo according to their own
 koi akhilesh ko kathghare main khadaa kar rahaa he to koi ise mayawati kii siyaasi maaya bataa rahaa he
 Everyone has their own arguments
 akhilesh ko sata rahaa tha voton ke dhruvikaran kaa bhayspa supremeo akhilesh yadav 2014 or 2017 kaa chunaav parinaam nahin bhul paae honge
 Political analyst Amitabh Tiwari says that Narendra Modi, the then prime ministerial candidate (now Prime Minister) leading the bjp's campaign campaign in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, used to openly say that defeat in the election is acceptable, but politics of appeasement Will not do tab modi kii lahar main aisa pehali baar hua jab loksabhaa main pradesh ke musalamaanon kaa pratinidhitiv shunya tha
 Tiwari said that even in the 2017 assembly elections, Akhilesh's slogan 'kama bolta hai', if the BJP gets electricity in Ramadan, even on Diwali, the issues of cemeteries and cremation were overshadowed
 aise main akhilesh kaa voton ke dhruvikaran se bhaybheet hona laazmi bhi he
 Mayamayawati has been trying to woo Muslims by trying to prove herself as Muslim friendly by claiming that the SP chief refused to give more tickets to Muslims and refused to accept it, on the other hand, the figures are telling a different story
 
 loksabhaa chunaavon ke hi pichley aankadon par najar daalen to yah spasht ho jaataa he ki soshal ejineering kii maahir maani jane vaali mayawati musalamaanon ko lubhaa dalit-muslim sameekaran banane kii koshish pehle se hi karti rahi hai
 In the recently concluded 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the SP-BSP alliance gave tickets to 10 Muslim candidates
 basapa se chah or sapa se chaar muslim chehre chunavi ranbhumi main taal thok rahe the
 Three, three candidates from both of these parties managed to reach the Parliament by winning the election
 aisa pehali baar nahin hua, jab basapa ne sapa se adhik musalamaanon ko tikat diya
 The BSP placed bets on 19 Muslims in 2014, 14 in 2009 and 20 Muslims in 2004, while the SP gave tickets to 14, 11 and 12 Muslims only
 gathbandhan ke peeche kya thi manshaamayawati kii akhilesh ke saath dosti karne ke peeche sabase badi vajah muslim matadaata rahe
 The Muslim voters of the state have been paying more attention to the SP than the BSP
 mayawati ne muslimon ko apane paale main laane ke liye kai tarah kaa prayog kiya
 Even after this, Muslim voters continued to give more importance to SP than BSP
 aise main loksabhaa chunaav main donon ke bich gathbandhan hua to basapa ne seat batwaarein main un siton ko liya jo muslim or dalit sameekaran se jiti ja sakati hai
 There were 24 seats out of 38 seats which had seen the influence of Dalit Muslims and BSP cadre in the previous elections
 iskaa phayda bhi mayawati ko mila or 38 siton main 10 siten jeetne main safal raheen
 Maya is not able to leave the politics of UP, according to the experts of politics, Mayawati, who was the chief minister of the country's largest state for four times, could not give up the temptation of politics in Uttar Pradesh
 chunaav se purv gathbandhan ke samay yah tay hua tha ki maaya centre kii raajnneeti main sakriy rahengi, vahiin akhilesh pradesh kii raajnneeti main
 Maya is confident that if her base voters combine with the Muslims, she can become the Chief Minister for the fifth time
 thik vaise hi, jaise 2007 main vah bramhan-dalit sameekaran ke sahare purna bahumat kii sarkaar banaakar kar bhi chuki hai

 On one hand, Pakistan Deputy High Commissioner was summoned by the Ministry of External Affairs, while the Indian Deputy High Commissioner went to Pakistan Foreign Office in Islamabad and lodged a similar protest

 The Delhi High Court has rejected the plea of the investigating agency CBI in which the court was requested for early hearing in the 2G case
 mangalvaar kii sunwaayee ke dauraan sibiai ne court ko kaha yah bahut gambhir maamla he is maamle main oktober main hone vaali agali sunwaayee tak ke liye intjaar nahin kiya ja saktaa
 The hearing in this case is continuously delayed

 He said that no information has been given to him yet by the CBI on the cbi's application for early hearing

 All the accused, including A
 Raja, Kanimozhi, were acquitted in the 2G case of 2017 by Delhi's Patiala House Court
 jiske khilaaf sibiai ne hai court main apil kii thi
 But even after passing the time of more than a year, there has been no special hearing on the appeal in the Delhi High Court in this case
 sibiai kii apil daakhil hone ke baad court se jari kiye gaye notice par apana jawaab daakhil karne main bhi e raja samet baaki logon ne maheenon kaa samay laga diya
 Due to repeated demands, the court was so angry that many times fine was also imposed
 8 saal puraane is maamle main court sibiai chaahati he ki dilli hai court se faisla samay par aae
 The trial in the lower court also lasted for about seven years
 lekin court ne na sirf sabhi hai profile aropiyon ko bari kar diya balki apane aadesh main likhvaya ki jaanch agency court main aropiyon ke khilaaf pukhta saboot hi pesh nahin kar pai or sabooton ke abhaav main court ko sabko bari karnaa padaa
 Following this order from the court, investigating agency like ED along with CBI also faced criticism at the national level

 But the CBI, instead of giving up in the case, moved the High Court against the trial court's decision

 Manmohan Singh's remarks target his enemies within the Congress or questions Rahul Gandhi's claim to the Prime Minister
" ’’ prasad ne kaha, baharhaal ye baaten puri tarah congress party kaa andruni maamla he
 But Dr
 Singh, "whose government is involved in many big scams and some of them are directly related to them, does not want people with crippling, anti-people, ineffective leadership and that too for the third innings
" ’’ He said, what is Singh's personal ambition or desire, it is only for him or his party to decide
 ‘‘lekin pradhanmantri ke rup main singh kaa gat lagbhag nau saal kaa kaarykaal nishchit rup se logon ke liye saarvajanik chintaa kaa vishay he
 Hence, the idea of giving him five more years as Prime Minister cannot be expected at all
 ’’ The party's chief spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad, while taking a sarcasm at Singh, said, "prime Minister Manmohan Singh has not ruled out the possibility of a third innings as Prime Minister if given an opportunity
" spasht rup se dow singh, jo ek anicchhuk rajaneta hai, ne holi ke kuch dinon baad hi apana asli rang dikhaa diya he

 After this, the police arrested both the accused on the basis of call detail

 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne jab shi jinping ke saath shiyaan main 14 may ko seemaa vivaad par charchaa kii thi, to chini raashtrapati ko dene ke liye unke paas mahaj ek sandesh tha
 However, this was something that no Indian leader had said to China in the last several years
 modi ne kaha tha ki bharat or china agar aapasi meljol ko gaharaa karnaa chaahate hai to rishton main aane vaale “raah ke rodon” kii ve or zyada upeksha nahin kar sakate
 Among the obstacles that Modi counted, the first place was the Line of Actual Control (LAC) & the obscure line that separates India and China
 adhikariyon kii maane to modi darasal seemaa vaarta ke centre main us prakriya ko dobaaraa laane kii koshish main the jo kareeb do dashak se gatirodh kii shikaar he
 The effort was to clarify the different perception of the two sides on the LAC, which was recognized by the two countries as the central element of the negotiation of the border dispute some 20 years ago and to be discussed separately for permanent resolution
 was
 yah prakriya 2002 ke baad se gatirodh main funs gai thi jab maanchitron ke aadan-pradaan kii koshishon ke bich china vaarta kii mej se uthakar chalaa gaya tha kyonki is baat kii naaraazgi thi ki bharat ne karakoram darre ke pashchim main sthit ilaake kaa zikr kyon kar diya? modi ne shi se sidhe kaha ki elesi par bhram kii sthiti gambhir chintaa kaa vishay he
 He said that this shadow of ambiguity was seen during Xi's visit to India last September when troops of the two countries came face-to-face for three weeks as both claimed that the land they stood on is part of their country
 
 china ke raashtrapati ne pradhanmantri kii baat to dhyaan se suni lekin apni ore se koi vachanabaddhata jaahir nahin kii
 It was three weeks after Modi returned from China to Delhi that the Chinese government showed its color
 barason se rukii padi elesi kii prakriya par china ke pehle saarvajanik bayaan main videsh mantralay ke ek sheersh adhikari huang shilian ne kah diya ki is prakriya ko dobaaraa shuru karne kaa beijing virdohi he
 He is the Deputy Director General in the Asia Department of China and is the central representative of China in engagement with India
 huang ne yahaan tak kah daalaa ki aisa karnaa seemaa vivaad ke samaadhaan main “avarodhya hoga or yah chetavanee jari kii ki elesi ko spasht karne kii prakriya ne seemaa vivaad par matbhedon ko sankara karne kii bajaae use or jatil bana diya he
 He told a group of Indian scholars who went to China, "A few years ago we tried to clean it up, but there were some problems that made the situation more complicated
 ” aakhir dikkatein kya thim? yah sawaal puche jane par unhone kaha, “iskaa vivaran dena mere adhikaar kshetra se baahar kii cheez he
 "the line of dispute: LAC is perhaps the only important element that ensures that the two countries across the Himalayas do not go back to war again
" iske baavjood is par kaaphi bhram bana hua he
 As is often said in the media during "chinese incursions across the line", this is an agreed line from both sides, this is wrong
 is par na to aaj tak koi sahmati bani he or na hi yah koi antim simarekha he
 As is clear from the name, it is a division that represents the areas which are currently under the control of both parties, on which a decision is pending until the boundary dispute is resolved
 seemaa par bharat or china ke bich pehla samjhauta 1962 kii jang ke baad hua tha jise teen dashak se zyada samay ho gaya
 The 1993 agreement to "maintain peace and peace" accepted the distinction between the two sides' perceptions, stating that "whenever necessary, the two sides will jointly examine and decide the parts of the LAC where There are differences between them
 ” vishwaas bahaali ke upayon (sibiem) ke tahat doosraa seemaa samjhauta 1996 main hua jo ek kadam aage badhate hue is sankalp ke saath sampann hua ki donon paksh “elesi par ek samaan samajhadaari” par pahunchane kii jarurat ko mahasoos karte hai or “jald se jald elesi par apni dharanaon ke mutabik maanchitron kaa aadan-pradaan karenge
 The exchange of maps began four years later when the two sides started working on the least disputed part & it was the middle part of the LAC
 bhartiya or chini adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki june 2000 or 2001 main hui vinimay kii yah prakriya kaaphi madadgaar rahi thi, bhale hi elesi ke chithran par kuch matbhed rahe hon, jinamein sabase zyada ahm hissaa uttarakhand main barahoti ke paas kaa tha
 a year later however, the picture began to deteriorate when the two sides began negotiations on the decisive western sector, where according to India, China occupies at least 38,000 square kilometers of territory in Aksai Chin
 seemaa vaarta main shaamil rahe china ke ek purv adhikari ne bataaya ki china kaa virodh is baat par tha ki bharat ne vaarta main pakistan adhikrut kashmir (pioke) kaa mudda kyon uthaaya, bhale hi bharat pioke ko apane parikshetra ke anivaary hisse ke taur par maanata ho
 The official said, “initially our differences were about the middle sector but we resolved it
 hamane jab pashchimi hisse par samjhaute kii koshish kii to bharat ne kaha, “aapako pehle china-pakistan seemaa ko tay karnaa hoga, uske baad china-bharat seemaa par aap faisla kar sakate hai
 “it is difficult for China to do this, so we cannot continue it
 ”taaja gatirodhagenda ke centre main elesi ko dobaaraa laakar bharat ne yah sandesh diya he ki donon desh ladakh ke depasang or chumaar sectoron main senaaon ke aamane-saamne aa jane kii sthiti kaa doharaaya janaa gavaara nahin kar sakate
 Such a situation created a tense relationship between Prime Minister Li Keqiang in 2013 and President Xi's visit to India in 2014
 modi ne 15 may ko beijing kii shinghua uniwarsity main die apane sambodhan main saaf shabdon main yah sandesh de diya tha&bharat ke kisi bhi netaa ne aisa pehali baar saarvajanik taur par or vah bhi china main jaakar kiya he
 The Prime Minister said, “there is always a sword of uncertainty hanging over sensitive areas of the border area
 aisa isliye he kyonki donon pakshon ko yah nahin maaloom ki in ilaakon main elesi kahaan he
 That is why i propose to restart the process to make it clear
 ” kab ke bhulaae ja chuke 1993 ke samjhaute kaa aahvaan karte hue modi ne kaha ki “seemaa ke sawaal par apni sthitiyon kii vajah se kisi purvaagrah se mukt hokar” aisa kiya ja saktaa he
 Experts say that the risk involved in prioritizing the process of clarifying the LAC is creating a new deadlock that will require both sides to come back to the negotiating table
 bhartiya adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki elesi ko spasht karne kii maang koi shart nahin thi jo ki sambandhon ke duusare ayaamon main aadchan paidaa kar sake
 It is not clear that China would have seen it this way
 ab china ke taaja “aachaar samhita” vaale prastaav par adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki shaayad yah bharat ke buniyadi dhaanche ko adhyatan karne kii lambit prakriya ko rokane kii manshaa se laayaa gaya ho
 Overall, the situation is that both countries are once again in the midst of a new deadlock in finding a solution to the border dispute
 jyotish ke jaankaron or shastron ke anusaar mana jaataa he ki hanumanji amar hai isliye vah kalyug main sabase sakriy devataaon main se ek hai
 According to Shri Ramcharit Manas composed by Goswami Tulsidas, Pawanputra Hanumanji was given the boon of immortality by Mata Sita

 dilli ke ek kaarykram main sangh pramukh mohan bhagwat ne phir se dharmantaran kaa mudda uthaaya
 He said that it is wrong to convert due to lack and inconvenience
 dilli main sangh se jude ek sanghathan ke kaarykram main bhagwat ne kaha ki abhaav main rahane vaale logon kaa dharm parivartan karana bahut galat he
 Even on Saturday, Mohan Bhagwat had called the homecoming program right
 unka kahana tha ki jo log bhuule bhatke hindu dharm se baahar chale gaye hai unki vaapasi karaane main kuch bhi buraai nahin he
 The furore over the conversion has not stopped
 mohan bhagwat ke baad ab vishwa hindu parishad ne bhi dharm yuddh ched diya he
 Vishwa Hindu Parishad leader Ashok Singhal said that we have come to win hearts, not for conversion
 ashok singhl yaheen nahin ruke
 He also showed fear of the Third World War
 unhone kaha ki islamic aatankwaad se tisare vishwa yuddh kii ore bad rahi he duniya
 World War is bound to happen due to Muslims, Christians and Communists
 kendriya mantri venkaiya naidu bhi maanate hai ki swechha se kiya gaya dharmantaran thik he, lekin agar ye jabaran hota he, to galat he
 The Congress has strongly opposed this view of the Union and the Government
 congress netaa raashid alvi ne kaha ki jo bayanaat singhl de rahe hai, usase dilon ko todaa to ja saktaa he, jeeta nahin ja saktaa
 In the war on religion, there is government and union on one side, and on the other side, total opposition
 rajyasabha main vipaksh sarkaar ko aankh dikhaa rahaa he, to pradhanmantri kaa maun rup chingaari ko or hawa de rahaa he
 It is to be seen whether the government wins the opposition's heart or the opposition's government on conversion

 Taking a stand against Governor Hansraj Bhardwaj on the recommendation of President's rule in Karnataka, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) has decided to meet Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to demand his sacking and his chief ministers from Chief Minister BS Yeddyurappa to the President's Have asked to parade before
 bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ke varisht netaa arun jetali ne kaha, rajg centre sarakar ko report bhejne ke karnataka ke rajyapal ke kadam kii kadi ninda karata he
 The Governor's conduct is biased
 yah sabhi sanvaidhanik niyam kaayadon or siddhanton kaa ulanghan karata he
 There is little doubt that the Yeddyurappa government has an absolute majority in the assembly
 unhone kaha ki ucchtam nyaayalay ke faisle ke falswaroop 11 nilambit sadsy bhaajapa ke sadsy samajhe gaye or ve uske vip se bandhe hue hai
 He said that the NDA has decided to meet the Prime Minister and raise the issue and demand that the Governor be called back
 jetali ne kaha, hamaara iraadaa pradhanmantri ke samaksh do khaas mudde uthaanaa he
 Firstly, this report is unconstitutional and should be rejected by the central government and secondly, the Governor of Karnataka is repeatedly taking unconstitutional steps and hence he should be recalled for violating the constitution
 rajg netritv ne yediurppa se apane sabhi samarthak vidhayakon ko dilli laane or raashtrapati ke samaksh parade karaane ko bhi kaha he taaki vah apana sankhyabal sabit kar saken
 Jaitley said, "we will take all the mlas supporting the government to the President and demonstrate our strength in Rashtrapati Bhavan as there is no need to test the power in the House
" bharadwaj kii report se uthe mudde par vichaar karne ke liye rajg kii apaat baithak gathbandhan ke kaaryakari adhyaksh laal krishna adwani ke awaas par hui
 Bhardwaj is said to have recommended imposition of President's rule in Karnataka
 jetali ne kaha ki in 11 vidhayakon ne yediurppa sarkaar se samarthan waapas lene ke sambandh main chah aktubar, 2010 ko likhe patr waapas le liye hai
 He said, the legislators themselves have said that they support the government
 rajg kaa kahana he ki 121 vidhayak yediurppa kii aguwai vaali kinartak kii bhaajapa sarkaar kaa samarthan kar rahe hai or 225 sadasyeey vidhansabha main vipaksh ke paas mahaj 97 siten hi hai
 The BJP is also angry that the Governor is not heeding the Chief Minister's advice to call a special session
 jetali ne kaha, taarkik prakriya yah hoti ki sadan main shakti pareekshan karaayaa jaataa
 As long as the government is in majority, the governor is obliged to act on his advice under the constitution
 bharadwaj ne mantriparishad kii salaah ke anusaar kaam nahin kar ke asanvaidhanik krity kiya he
 Punjab Chief Minister Prakash Singh Badal has categorically denied any confrontation between his party Shiromani Akali Dal and its ally BJP
 badal ne kaha ki donon dalon ke bich gatirodh kaa shaayad hi koi mudda ho
 However, he also said that the breakdown of relations between the two parties could threaten the peace of the state
 badal ne guru nanak dev kii jayanti ke maukey par yojit ek khel pratiyogita ke baad kaha, 'bijepi kaa rashtriya netritv apane sabase puraane saathi akali dal ke saath sambandh kabhi nahin todega
 Talking about Navjot Singh Sidhu's recent statements, he said, "there is hardly an issue of deadlock between the two parties as there is an inherent mechanism to resolve all issues of the alliance's constituents by mutual consent
" ' siddhu sahit kai bijepi netaaon ne kaha tha ki akali dal ne haryana main inelo ke saath rishta jodakar gathbandhan dharm kaa ulanghan kiya he
 However, Badal also said that if the BJP breaks the alliance, the peace of Punjab will be in danger
 unhone kaha, 'agar bijepi yah gathbandhan todatii he to punjab main shanti khatre main pad jaaegi
 Our relationship with BJP is 30 years old
 yah sachcha rishta he or bijepi ko yah samajhnaa chahie
 He said that the Akali dal-bjp alliance is in the interest of the nation and Punjab
 badal ne daawa kiya ki unhone bijepi adhyaksh amit shah or kendriya vitt mantri arun jetali se mulaakaat kii or un donon ne akali dal-bijepi gathbandhan kaa samarthan kiya he
 With this, both the leaders have said that they are unable to understand why some BJP leaders are against this alliance

 The special thing about this film is that the story of this film has been written by Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M
 Karunanidhi
 film kaa naam he, ni indri naan illai
 Apart from the story of the film, the screenplay and dialogue are also written by Karunanidhi
 ye film karunanidhi kii hi ek kitaab, sulli malae par aadhaarit he
 According to him, this is the story of a man who fights for the rights of women
 raajnneeti main aane se pehle karunanidhi ne sirf bees saal kii umr main, tamil film rajkumaari, kii script likhi thi
 People still remember the dialogue of the Tamil film Parasakthi
 karunanidhi ab 80 saal se bhi zyaada ke ho chuke hai auki raajnneeti kii duniya main kaafii vyast rahete hai, lekin likhane kaa shauk badastoor jari he
 Recently, intelligence agencies had issued an alert, during the elections in different states and towns of the country, cross-border terrorists can target big leaders
 ab aatanki sanghathan jaish-e-mohammad ke sargana moulana abdul rauf asagar ne pakistan ke karachi main ek raily main khufia vibhaag kii ashanka kii tasdik kar di he ki agle saal 5 farvari aate-aate dilli dahala denge
 Maulana Masood Azhar's younger brother and jaish-e-mohammad's leader Maulana Rauf Asghar, while addressing a rally of new recruits and relatives of terrorists killed in Jaish in Karachi, Pakistan, declared war in the hills of Kashmir and other parts of India
 have make
 karanchi main mangalvaar ko hui is raily ko sambodhit karte hue moulana rauf asagar kah rahaa he ki agle 5 farvari ko jab ham ek baar phir kashmir soliderity de manaayenge tab tak dilli dahal chuki hogi
 According to sources, 7 teams of jaish-e-muhammad's Fidayin from this rally have been sent to various cities of India on Tuesday
 disambar 2018, jaish kaa top trainer commander abdul rashid gaji jammu-kashmir main ghusane main kaamyaab rahaa
 Intelligence agencies have already alerted security agencies about the infiltration of Ghazi and the increased terrorist incidents in the Valley in the last two months are being described as part of Abdul Rashid Ghazi's plan
 aapako bataa den ki jaish commander abdul rashid gaji afghanistan main talibaniyon ke saath milakar lard chukaa he
 And before entering Jammu and Kashmir, Pakistan has been the Chief Instructor in Jaish's training camp in occupied Kashmir
 gaji jaise durdaant aatanki ke kashmir main daakhil hone ke baad se ghati main aatanki ghatnaon main badhotaree hui he or desh main uski maujuudagi surakshabalon ke liye pareshaani kaa sabab ban sakati he
 Significantly, a few months ago, intelligence agencies issued an alert that the terrorists of jaish-e-mohammed and Hizbul Mujahideen are leaving the valley and are planning to carry out major terrorist incidents in the plains of the country
 agenciyon ne apane alert main kaha tha ki seemaa se aae aatanki chunaav ke samay main reliyon or bade netaaon ko nishaanaa bana sakate hai
 In such a situation, the departure of 7 teams of Fidayin to India from this rally in Karachi may be part of the larger plan
 sibiai kah rahi he ki rail mantri pawan bansal ke bhaanje vijay singla ne paise liye, lekin is sawaal kaa philhal koi jawaab nahin he ki kya singla hi ghuscand kii aakhri kadi he? yaa phir singla ne ghoose kii rakam kisi or ko pahunchaai?aise kai sawaal hai jinka jaanch agency jawaab dhundne kii koshish kar rahi he
 Therefore, the CBI can also interrogate Railway Minister Pawan Bansal if necessary
 darasal, sutara bataate hai ki vijay singla ne ghuscand main badi sajeesh kaa ishaara kiya he
 At the moment it is not clear when Pawan Bansal will be questioned
 lekin ham aapako bataate hai ki aakhir kyon ho sakati he pawan bansal se poochtacha?darasal, puraa maamla railway bord ke bade adhikari kii niyukti se judaa he
 At the same time, questions are also being raised whether the appointment of an officer of the Railway Board is possible without the signature of the Railway Minister
 The questioning of the Railway Minister is also possible because the bribe is taken by the nephew who used to collect funds for the election of the Railway Minister
 rail mantri se poochtacha isliye bhi ho sakati he kyonki puraa kaa puraa ghuscand rail mantri kii naak ke neeche hua he
 Actually, CBI is trying to find out who is the driver of the bribe train? The CBI is trying to find out whether Vijay Singla kept the bribe money himself or took it even further? In the investigation so far it is clear that Vijay Singla and Sandeep Goyal took the bribe
 rail mantri ke bhaanje vijay singla or uske dost sandip goyal ko ghoose mahesh kumaar ke pramotion ke liye di gai or ghoose kii rakam manjunath ne ikattha kii, jo is puure khel kaa mastermind tha
 Rahul Yadav and Sameer Sandhir collected money for Manjunath
 ab dekhne vaali baat hogi ki sibiai ye pataa laga paati he yaa nahin ki ghoose kii rakam vijay singla tak hi rahi yaa phir aage bhi kisi ke paas pahunchi or agar pahunchi to kahaan tak? Although almost every artist wants to enter Bollywood, but after coming to Mumbai, the journey to the silver screen is not so easy

 On the issue of working soldiers, the department believes that they will continue to get the exemption of drinking liquor in the camp premises
 cantonment se baahar yaa ghar laakar ve sharaab nahin pi sakenge
 In many districts of the state, liquor is being sold outside the cantonment area in the name of CSD, such licenses will be canceled

 India has sold some part of the game to private interests, and the conflict of interest of some of its administrators has made it difficult to adapt to the spirit of the game

 unhone kaha, cricket par bisisiai kaa niyantran adhik he, kyonki iske paas isisi kii baithkon main kisi bhi prastaav kaa virodh karne ke liye paryaapt vot hote hai
 The reason for this is that the survival of some countries cannot go on without financial help from India
