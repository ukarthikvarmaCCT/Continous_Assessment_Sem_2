 nursery admician ke liye rajdhani ke skool is baar pehle aao, pehle paao kii shart rakh rahe hai
 For the admission of children, many schools have placed a condition that the one who comes first will become the candidate for admission by getting higher number

 There are also attractive offers such as parents' first 'first serve' for nursery admission in private schools
 pehle to abhibhavakon ko number system kii maathapai se do-chaar hona padataa tha
 But now some private schools in Delhi have decided the admission process on first come first serve basis
 pashchimi dilli ke bharti model skool ne to puure 100 point sirf isi niyam ke aadhaar par hi fiks kar die hai
 Delhi International Happy School is also included in this race

 In Uttar Pradesh, the Yogi government has discovered the SP-BSP alliance
 soobe main pichhadon ko milane vaale 27 fisadi aarakshan ke bheetar aarakshan kaa formula tay ho gaya he
 According to the report of Raghavendra Committee, 7 percent of the affluent backward will get 27 percent reservation for OBC castes
 baaki 20 fisadi ati pichhadi jatiyon ke cote main jayega
 The four-member social justice committee has said in its report that out of the total 27 percent quota reserved for obcs, only seven percent reservation can be given to Yadav and Kurmi
 uttar pradesh kii yogi sarkaar ne obisi ke bheetar up-jatiyon ke vargeekaran ke liye is samiti kaa gathan kiya tha
 The committee headed by Justice Raghavendra Kumar has identified 79 sub-castes of the obcs
 raghavendra cameti kii report abhi saarvajanik nahin hui he, lekin kuch hisse saamne aae hai
 Under this, obcs have been given three classifications under Quota with In Quota
 report ke mutabik sampann pichhadi jatiyon main yadav, ahir, jat, kurmi, sonar or chaurasia sareekhee jatiyaan shaamil hai
 They will get 7 percent reservation
 jabaki duusari anya pichhadi jatiyon ko 20 fisadi aarakshan main shaamil kiya gaya he
 In the report, 7 percent reservation has been proposed to 9 castes including yadav-kurmi
 ati pichhadaa varg main giri, gurjar, gonsai, lodh, kushvaha, kumhaar, mali, lohaar samet 65 jatiyon ko 11 pratishat or mallaah, kevat, nishad, rai, gaddi, ghosi, rajbhar jaisi 95 jatiyon ko 9 pratishat aarakshan kii shifarish kii gai he
 However, the final decision on this report is to be taken by the Yogi government
 is report ke mutabik aarakshan ke bheetar aarakshan tay hoga yaa phir sarkaar isamen kuch sanshodhan karegi, yah tay hona philhal baaki he
 According to the ongoing discussions within the government, 27 percent reservation of obcs is in favor of giving 9-9 percent reservation to the three classes
 yogi sarkaar bhi bavaal ko dekhte hue philhal ise taalane ke mood main he
 This report is extremely unlikely to be laid on the Table of the House in the current winter session
 sapa adhyaksh akhilesh yadav ne kaha unki party kaa stand saaf he
 There should be reservation according to the population
 desh main jatiyon ke aadhaar par janaganana ho or uske baad tab aarakshan kaa formula tay kiya janaa chahie
 According to the report of the Raghavendra Committee, 27% of OBC reservation has been the biggest beneficiary
 aise main cote ke bheetar kota tay hona chahie, kyonki obisi kii baaki 70 fisadi jatiyaan ab bhi aarakshan ke phaayde se vanchit he

 ’unhone haalanki gendbaajon ko bhi aade haathon lete hue kaha, ‘score kam tha to gendbaaji acchhee hona jaruri tha
 It was necessary to avoid throwing short balls
 ’ravinder jadeja ko aakhri over dene ke faisle kaa bachaav karte hue unhone kaha, ‘hamane teen yaa chaar over pehle hi tej gendbaajon kaa kota puraa kara liya tha
 At that time Pakistan was scoring very fast and we had to play that gamble

 Sanjay Leela Bhansali's film Padmavat continues to protest
 sutron kii maane to shahid kapur, deepika padukon or ranvir singh jaise sitare film kaa pramotion nahin karenge

 Sources say that the film's promotion will be kept weak due to controversy and threats
 padmavat ke saath hi akshay kumaar kii film pedman bhi 25 janvari ko relies ho rahi he
 Is this a big reason Bhansali wants to be released only on January 25, organizations like 'padmavat' Karankarini Sena are still opposing the film
 relies hone par cinemagharon main hinsa or aagjanee kii dhamkiyaan bhi di gai hai
 It is believed that the producers are scared of threats and want to save the film very much

 It was clarified on behalf of the producers about those points, about which the film has been in dispute for the last few days

 The BJP is seeking votes in the names of PM Modi and CM Yogi to win the Bawana by-election
 bavana gaanv main piem narendra modi or siem yogi ke bade-bade binar or poster lagaae gaye hai
 On Sunday, during the Mahapanchayat in Bawana, the BJP exerted full power to vote in its favor
 kendriya mantri birendra singh, haryana sarkaar main mantri ramvilas sharma ne mahapanchayat ke manch se bavana kii janata se vot maangen

 Bawana by-election will be held against Kejriwal government, while talking to 'ajatak', Manoj Tiwari said that "the issue is not Ved Prakash, the issue that Kejriwal is pushing Delhi back 5 years
" jhuggi main pani nahi, dilli main sisitivi nahi, jahaan jhuggi vahaan makaan nahi, isliye bavana kaa upachunaav kejariwal sarkaar ke khilaaf jayega
 This is the reason why PM Narendra Modi has a hope
 veda prakaash ke bijepi main aane kaa koi kanfusion nahin hoga
 Ved Prakash resigned from the Aam Aadmi Party against misrule
 janata samajhati he ki veda prakaash unke hit main he
 On the question of seeking more votes in the name of PM than the candidate for a by-election, Tiwari said that "arvind Kejriwal is roaming from house to house as there is no crowd in the gathering
" mukhyamantri jab khud gum rahe hai to bavana ke chunaav ko halke main nahi le sakate hai
 "BJP MP blamed Kejriwal and Sheila Dixit while delivering speech from the platform of BJP Mahapanchayat in Khilibwana, MP Pravesh Verma ridiculed Arvind Kejriwal
 saath hi purv siem shila ko bhi nishane par liya
 He said neither Sheila Dixit remembered Outer Delhi nor Kejriwal

 At the same time, he said that PM Modi showed the work that doctors from the country or abroad could not do
 unhone kejariwal kii khaansee khatm kar di he
 Has anyone heard Kejriwal's cough ever since MCD and Rajouri were elected? The rest of Kejriwal's illnesses will end after the Bawana election "

 adhikari ne kaha, "yadi pakistani sena hakkaani ke khilaaf karrwai karti he to isse use koi phayda nahin hona he

 pradhanmantri narendra modi 14 april ko jab madhya pradesh main gram udai se bharat udai abhiyaan kii shuruyaat kar rahe the, us samay unki sarkaar sookhe par supreme court ke liye jawaab taiyaar kar rahi thi, jo use adaalat kii fatkaar ke baad daakhil karnaa tha
 In the third week of April, when the government told the court that one-fourth of the country's population was in the grip of drought, the party was handing over the program to its farmers and mps to organize Kisan Melas in the villages
 natijatan, pani kii kami, kheti kii badahaali or sookhe ke bich gram udai janata to kya, bijepi ke saansadon ke gale bhi nahin utraa jo sarkari skiimon kaa bharpoor prachaar na karne ko lekar aajkal pradhanmantri se aksar jhidkiyaan or naseehaten sun rahe hai
 It is surprising to find mps in a government with a strong majority led by a charismatic leadership in two years
 khaastaur par aisi party ke saansad jo lambey arase baad satta main lauti ho or jisaki sarkaar lagbhag har maheene koi nayaa mishan yaa skim upja rahi ho
 The cold stance of its own mps on the government's campaigns and schemes is telling a truth, which the government is not ready to understand
 sirf gramoday hi nahin, behatar manshaa ke baavjood pichley do saal main sarkaar ke kai abhiyaan or mishan jamini hakeekat se gahari asangati ke namoonay ban gaye hai
 This is the reason why such changes were not seen, about which the mps could get the eye of the people full of expectations
 modi sarkaar ne gavarnence or saamaajik-aarthik kshetron kii kai dukhati ragon par ungali rakhane kii koshish kii he lekin adhiktar prayog jaden nahin pakad sake
 If some missions were not able to start in due course, then some schemes were not ready to run, so within two years almost all the major missions and schemes of Modi government have started a necessary restructuring
 misaal ke taur par mek in india ko hi len, jo aarthik vaastaviktaa se kataa hone ke kaaran jahaan kaa tahaan thahar gaya
 There is no doubt that investment in manufacturing is necessary, but when the Modi government came to power, the industrial sector was in the grip of a recession in which companies have huge production capacities ready but demand is not there
 jab karj main dabi companiyaan bainkon kii musiibat bani hai to nivesh kya hoga
 The foreign investment that came in two years went to the service sector which was not the focus of the government, while manufacturing units were shutting down or reducing production

 chhattisgarh main vidhansabha chunaav se pehle hi congress main mukhyamantri kii ummidavaari ko lekar ghamaasan shuru ho gaya he
 The number of Chief Ministerial contenders in the Chhattisgarh Congress has been steadily increasing
 abhi tak congress ke aadha darjan netaa mukhyamantri pad kii daavedaari pesh kar chuke hai
 With full activism, Congress leaders are claiming the chief minister's post
 haalanki beete 15 varshon se soobe main bijepi kii sarkaar he, jiske chalate congress kii qamar tuuti hui he, lekin is baar satta virdohi lahar kaa ahsaas hone ke andeshe ke chalate congressiyon kii rajnatik mahatvakanksha sir chadhakar bol rahi he
 This can be gauged from the fact that more than a dozen leaders are trying to beat each other in the race for the chair, while Raman Singh is the chief minister's face in the BJP
 vah vartmaan main bhi soobe ke mukhyamantri hai
 The BJP has made it clear that the fourth assembly election will also be fought under the leadership of Chief Minister Raman Singh
 haalanki congress main "siem in vatting" kii lambii qatari se party ke bheetar gutbaji or antarkalah ufaan par he
 The BJP is considering this as a good sign for itself
 congress main ye hai mukhyamantri pad ke daavedabhi tak congress main jin netaaon ne khud ko bataur mukhyamantri pesh karnaa shuru kar diya he, uname netaa pratipaksh ties singhdev, pradesh congress adhyaksh bhupesh baghel, purv kendriya mantri charan das mahant, kaaryakari pradesh adhyaksh ramadayal uike va doctor shiv dahariya or purv netaa pratipaksh ravindra choube awwal hai
 Apart from this, many other leaders of tribal, scheduled caste and general class are also claiming themselves as the contenders for the Chief Minister
 congress alaakaman tay karegaa aagaamee CM kaa namamukhyamantri banane ke sapane sajone vaale netaaon kii badhati fehrist ko dekhakar pradesh congress adhyaksh bhupesh baghel ko kahana pad rahaa he ki siem koun banegaa, yah to party alaakaman tay karegaa
 Right now his priority is to oust the BJP government from power
 duusari ore mukhyamantri ke daavedaaron ke rukh or vyavhaar se netaaon ke bich aapasi ghamaasan or pratispardhaa shuru ho gai he
 Its direct impact is on the Congress's anti-bjp programs
 rajya kii bijepi sarkaar ke khilaaf yojit dharna pradarshnon main gutbaji safataur par dikhaai pad rahi he
 For the fourth time for the post of CM, BJP has imposed a bet on Raman Singh, assembly elections will be held in Chhattisgarh in october-november this year
 lihaaja jahaan bijepi ne chauthi baar bhi mukhyamantri pad ke liye raman singh par daanv lagaaya he, vahiin congress ne abhi tak yah saaf nahin kiya he ki wo kiske netritv main janata ke bich jaaegi
 Congress leader TS Singhdev said - i want to be the CM Leader of Opposition TS Singhdev issued a statement saying that he wants to become the Chief Minister, but he will become the Chief Minister only if the party gives consent, not by backing anyone
 iske baad sirf sarguja hi nahin, balki puure chhattisgarh kaa wo vikaas karenge
 After this statement by Singhdev, there has been an uproar within the Congress
 har ek chhatrap khud ko mukhyamantri kaa daavedaar ghoshit karne main juta he
 Competition within the party has increased so much that TS Singhdev has to give clarification inside and outside the party on the statement that he is a contender for the post of Chief Minister
 party ke bheetar bane nae samikarnon se ties singhdev ko apni safai main yah tak kahana padaa ki party main mukhyamantri banane ke yogya 13 se adhik chehre hai
 BJP took a pinch, said- Congress is cooking up the casserole, while state Congress in-charge PL Punia has kept a close watch on all the leaders who are claiming the Chief Minister
 mukhyamantri ko lekar jis teji se party ke bheetar ghamaasan machaa he, use dekhakar wo bhi pashopesh main hai
 He is explaining to his leaders that CM project is never done in Congress
 vahiin, bijepi ne congress main mache ghamaasan ko lekar chutki lee he
 BJP President Dharam Lal Kaushik has said that the Congress is cooking only rich casserole
 unhone daawa kiya ki chauthi baar bhi bijepi satta main aegi
 Chief Minister Raman Singh also attacked the Congress and said that this time the Congress will not find its mlas
 unka daawa he ki chhattisgarh ab congress mukt hone ja rahaa he
 In the current political equation, the Congress is likely to face stiff competition between the BJP and Congress in the assembly elections, but with the active participation of former Chief Minister Ajit Jogi, the Congress is in danger of division of votes
 darasal, pichley vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi or congress ke bich maton kaa antar ek fisadi se bhi kam rahaa he
 As a result, out of the total 90 assembly seats in the state, BJP managed to capture 49 seats and Congress 39 seats, while only one seat went to BSP
 haalanki vot pratishat ke behad kam antar ke khatre ko bhaanpate hue is baar bijepi ne sabhi 90 vidhansabha siton par apni badhat banane ke liye koi kasar baaki nahin chhodana chaahati he
 All its genetic organizations are determined to maintain the party's strength at the booth level
 isaki tulana main congress samet duusare virdohi dalon kii utani sakriyata dikhaai nahin de rahi he
 At present, the arrogance within the Congress and the eagerness of the leaders about the Chief Minister's post have increased the party's troubles

 mahaan vaigyanik stephen hawking kii baat chalegi to big baing, blike hole, god spot, god theory jaisi baari bharkam bahasein kaanon main gunjane lagengi
 But a funny, mischievous, and spotty answer hidden within this sharp and logical mind is when you meet Stephen Hawking when you hear and read some of his interview responses
 hawking ke bebaak javaabon ne kai baar gudgudaya to kai baar hairaan kar diya
 And sometimes, their answers came from pushing logic and calling sensitivity great
 udhar unke shararti swabhaav kaa andaja tab lagata he jab ve hansate hue kehete hai, auraten unke liye brahmand se bhi zyada rahasyamayi hai
 However, he was not the first to give such opinions on women
 inase pehle duusari mashhoor hastiyon jaise manovaigyanik frid, english poit or plarieter wiliam shakespeare ne bhi auraton ko ek rahasy qaraar diya tha
 Here are some of the questions asked in their special interviews and their answers: In the year 2015 of the website 'reddit MA', she was asked, which is the mystery which is the most difficult to solve? 
 2010 main stephen hawkings ne abisis 'world new tunite' ke intervyuu ke dauraan jab unase poocha gaya ki aap bacchon ko kya khaas salaah dena chahenge?jawaab-unhone kaha, main apane bacchon ko yahaan teen ahm salahen dena chaahunga
 First, remember to always look up at the stars, not at the feet
 duusari, kaam karnaa kabhi mat chhodana kyonki kaam tumhen jindagi kaa arth or uddeshy detaa he
 Life is empty without work
 teesri, agar kismat se tumhen tumhaara pyaar mil jaae to use kabhi mat chhodana
 He gave many funny answers in John Oliver's famous interview
 oliver ne mazaakia andaaj main poocha, stephen hawkings aapane samanaantar brahmand ke siddhant par kaam kiya, kya aisa koi brahmand hoga jahaan main aapse zyada smart ho saktaa hum?jawaab- stephen hawkings ne chutki lete hue kaha, haa bilkul
 And yes there can be a universe where you are much more fun than me
 
 
 darasal stephen khud ko behad phani maanate the
 Stephen believed that life would be very sad if we would not be funny
 oliver ne poocha, robot se ham lard sakate hai?jawaab- haar jaaoge
 Oliver asked, if i removed the robot plug? Answer - Stephen Hawking answered it in a fictional manner
 vaigyanikon ne ek budhimaan computer banaaya phir isse pehla sawaal poocha, kya yahaan bhagwaan he? jawaab mila, 'ab he'
 And the spark came out of the plug and then the computer could not be turned off
 jab bhagwaan ke astitv par uthaa diye the sawaal
 In John C
 Linox's book 'god and Stephen Hawking', he considered the basis of the creation of the universe not on God but on physical science
 unhone kaha, brahmand ke peeche bhautik vigyaan ke niyam hai na ki bhagwaan
 However he also said, i do not claim that God does not exist
 is par duniyabar main bahes shuru ho gai
 Stephen Hawking gave an answer when asked about the death in an article in The Gargion
 jawaab-maut se main darataa nahin
 Yes, but in no hurry
 marane se pehle mere paas bahut kuch he karne ke liye jo main karnaa chahta hum
 In this article, he also dismantled the concept of heaven and said, according to me, mind is like a computer
 jiskaa jivan khatm hone ke baad uske orgen fail ho jate hai
 There is no life after death, heaven is just a fantasy of humans

 The eye will remain on social media! BJP is resorting to social media to implement this plan

 chunaav se pehle prachaar main bijepi, jedies or congress ne apni puri takat jhonk rakhi he
 The Congress on Wednesday lashed out at the Narendra Modi government, saying that as the prime ministerial candidate of the BJP, Modi had made inflation the biggest issue in the election, but surprisingly, in his first budget, there was no way to deal with it
 Not even mentioning
 loksabhaa main aaj aam bajet par charchaa kii shuruyaat karte hue congress ke jyotiraditya sindhiya ne kaha ki nai sarkaar banane ke baad sansad ke pehle satr main raashtrapati ke abhibhaashan ke jariye pradhanmantri narendra modi ne kaha tha ki mahangaai par kaabo paanaa unki sarkaar kii pehali praathamikta hogi
 But in reality this government increased the prices of rail fares, petrol and diesel and did not take any action against hoarders and black marketers to curb inflation
 sindhiya ne sarkaar se sawaal kiya ki mahangaai badhaane vaale kitne jamaakhoron or kalabazriyon ke khilaaf karrwai kii yaa unhen giraftaar kiya
 He said, 'it is easy to dream dreams and awaken hope, but it is very difficult to fulfill them
 ' sarkaar par sidhaa nishaanaa sadhate hue unhone kaha ki pradhanmantri ne raashtrapati ke abhibhaashan ke jariye yah bhi kaha tha ki bharat kii pahchaan 'scam india' kii ho gai he jise todna jaruri he
 Scindia said, but large amounts of gold and silver have been recovered from the house of the ruling party MP Giriraj Singh with cash of Rs one crore 14 lakh
 unhone jaananaa chaha ki kya is sadsy ke khilaaf karrwai hogi? unhone kaha ki agar ghar saaf nahin hoga to desh saaf kaise ho saktaa he? unhone kaha ki barason baad apane boote koi party bahumat kii sarkaar banane main safal hui, lekin iske baavjood uske bajet main saahasik nirnyon or lakshyon kaa purnataya: abhaav he
 Taking a dig at the slogans given by Narendra Modi and the BJP in the election, Scindia said, "for a year, we have been hearing what miracles the BJP will do when it comes to power
" mahangaai kam kar degi, achche din laaegi, garibi mitaa degi, sabakaa saath lekar sabakaa vikaas karegi
 He claimed that since the coming of this government, the burden on the common man has been reduced by Rs 416 per family, but at the same time the load of Rs 1200 has increased due to inflation etc
 unhone kaha ki beemaa kshetra kii epadiai ko is sarkaar ne 26 se badhaakar 49 fisadi karne kaa faisla kiya he, lekin yahaan ye yaad dilaanaa jaruri he ki jab yahi prastaav samprag sarkaar ne kiya tha to aaj ke pradhanmantri or gujarat ke tatkaaleen mukhyamantri narendra modi ne twit kiya tha ki 'bharat ko videshiyon ko bechaa ja rahaa he, hamen iskaa virodh karnaa chahie

 Speaking to the press at the Press Club of India, Pakistan High Commissioner Abdul Basit while answering various questions said that it was a mutual meeting of two people
 basit ne kaha, hamaari sarkaar ko or bharat sarkaar ko bhi is mulaakaat ke bare main nahin pataa tha
 It was a mutual meeting of two people and nothing else
 yah puche jane par ki kya pakistani khufia agency iesai ko mulaakaat ke bare main nahin pataa tha, unhone keval itnaa kaha ki pakistan sarkaar kaa isse kuch lenaa-dena nahin he
 Asked why the jud chief's alleged involvement in terrorist activities was not acted upon, the Pakistani High Commissioner said there was no 'evidence' to prosecute Saeed
 unhone kaha ki said ko jail main pahunchane ke liye pakistan sarkaar ko majboot sakshya kii jarurat hogi

 Rahul Gandhi today once again reiterated that if he is allowed to speak in the House, then he will not be able to stand there for a minute
 aaj dilli ke talkatoraa stadium main congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne videsh niti se lekar desh kii arthvyavastha or mahila suraksha tak par baat kii
 These are the 8 major issues of his speech through which he attacked PM Modi and BJP
 1
 Save daughter, but BJP and its mlas Serahul Gandhi said - 8-year-old girl is raped, Unnao is raped, but Modi does not say anything for his MLA
 2014 main 2 karod rojgaar, 15 lakh, beti bachaao kii baat kii gai thi
 Now their new slogan is "save daughter", but save from BJP, save from BJP MLA
 choti se bacchee kaa rape hota he, lekin bijepi ke vidhayak ke bare main pradhanmantri ne kuch nahin kaha
 Today the IMF Chief has also spoken about women's safety
 2
 Constitutional institutions to be suppressed Raharahul said that whatever constitutional bodies are in the country, they are being suppressed
 supreme court ke chaar jaj janata ke saamne insaaf ke liye guhaar lagane aae the
 But his voice was also suppressed
 desh ke sabhi sansthaanon ko hamaare samvidhan ne diya he
 iits, iims to Supreme Court
 lekin aaj sabhi sansthaaon par aresas kii vichaardhaara vaale logon ko daalaa ja rahaa he
 Whatever the BJP does, we will not let them touch the Constitution
 3
 If i speak on rafael-nirav, i will not be able to stand, pmrahul said that the government stopped him from speaking in Parliament
 agar rafel or neerav modi ke mudde par main 15 minute sansad main boluun to narendra modi ji khadey nahin ho paaenge
 The whole country knows that there was a theft in Rafael
 neerav modi 30 hajaar karod lekar bhaag jaataa he, lekin unke mitra chup rahete hai
 For the first time, the government is not allowing Parliament to run
 modi ji ne apane saansadon or vidhayakon se kaha ki tum log media ko masala dete ho
 Now the country will only listen to the Prime Minister's mind
 4
 Congress is the atrocities on Dalit Dalits, rape with girls and false assurance of employment to youth
 gabbar singh tex se vyapaaree or kisaanon ko barbaad kar diya
 The question of how the Congress will protect education, health, employment, women is in front of us, and only Congress will give solution to it
 samvidhan bachaao abhiyaan, daliton or kamjor logon kii raksha kaa abhiyaan congress joro se chalaaegi
 i will also join
 jahaan bhi bijepi daliton par atyaachaar karegi, vahaan congress kaa jhanda dikhaai degaa
 They have also come to know about our strength
 2019 main ham unhen satta se baahar kar denge
 5
 modi ko sirf modi se matlabamodi piem kaise bane? modi ko keval modi main intrest he
 Whether the Dalits die or atrocities with women, it does not matter to them
 keval piem banane main intrest he
 Modi ji only means to Modi
 6
 Atrocities happening with Dalits, Rahul said that the ideology of Modi should be understood by everyone in the country
 modi kehete hai ki daliton ke khilaaf atyaachaar bad rahaa he, lekin hakeekat ye he ki modi ke dil main daliton ke liye koi jagah nahin he
 pm's ideology is not supportive of Dalits
 daliton ke khilaaf atyaachaar bad rahaa he, lekin modi ji lagaataar chup rahe hai
 Cases like UP, Una are coming up
 congress ne gujarat main awaz uthaai tab teen din baad stage par modi ji aate hai or aansu nikal aate hai
 7
 modi ne duniya main kiya desh kaa naam badanampahle duniya kahati thi ki bharat main alag-alag log milakar rahete hai
 Used to say that the Constitution of India, Supreme Court, Parliament has some meaning
 baaki desh hamaari ore dekhte the, lekin duniya main desh kii izzat modi ji ne khatm kar di he
 Today, there is talk of rape of women, invasion of minority, oppression of Dalits in the world
 70 saalon main congress ne desh kii izzat banaai, lekin modi ji ne 4 saalon main modi ne isko nuksaan pahunchaaya he
 It has to be saved
 8
 With 'karmayogi-narendra Modi', Nisharahaul Gandhi started his speech with the words of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's book 'karmayogi-narendra Modi'
 rahul ne kaha ki jo toilet ko saaf karata he, jo gandagi uthaata he, uskaa kya aadhyatm nahin hota, jo valmiki samaaj karata he
 The person of Valmiki society does not do this work to fill his stomach, but he does this work because he does this work for spirituality
 uske mata-pita aasaani se ye kaam chhod sakate the, lekin unhone nahin choda

 Dengue and chikungunya witnessed a macabre appearance this year in Delhi
 pichley hafte dilli sarkaar ne is mahamari ke liye kuch afasaron par dosha madh kar apni jimmedaari se pallaa jhaadne kii tarkeeb nikaali
 But when the Supreme Court asked for the names of those officers, the Delhi government was helpless to file an affidavit in the country's top court
 is par supreme court ne dilli ke swasthya mantri satyendra jain par 25 hajaar rupee kaa jurmaana thonk diya
 Although this amount of fine is not very big, but it is a big slap for the Kejriwal government sitting on the chair of Delhi, claiming to be the primate of the common man
 desh kii rajdhani main dengue or chikangunia kaa aisa kahar kareeb 10 saal pehle dikhaa tha
 However, this problem has become common in the last few years in delhi-ncr
 har saal barish kaa mausam khatm hote hi dengue or chikangunia ke maamle saamne aane lagate hai
 Obviously, the Kejriwal government, which is ruling in Delhi, will also be accused of this
 lekin pichley maheene to ek samay aisi haalat ho gai thi ki aspataalon main dengue or chikangunia ke marijon kii taadaad badhati ja rahi thi or dilli sarkaar ke siem sahit puraa amala rajdhani se baahar tha
 Epidemic in Delhi, Government outing In the second week of September, when the epidemic was at its peak, there was no one to take care of the people of Delhi
 siem arvind kejariwal pehle punjab chunaav ke liye prachaar main nikle, phir apana ilaaj karwaane bengalooru chale gaye
 Deputy CM Manish Sisodia was on a tour of Finland while Health Minister Satyendar Jain was in Goa for election campaigning
 kejariwal cabinet ke kuch or mantri bhi anya vajahon se rajdhani se baahar the
 Delhi's Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung was on a tour of the US, Health Secretary of the Delhi government Chandrakar Bharti had gone on a 15-day leave
 swasthya mantri kaa gyaan or gussakhaiyr, dilli main mahamari kaa masalaa media kii surkhiyaan bana to dilli sarkaar ke swasthya mantri apni party ke liye chunaav prachaar kar dilli laute
 When journalists here asked him questions about the health of Delhi, they started explaining to science that there has not been a single death in the world due to chikungunya
 wo is dauraan patrakaron par bhi bhadak uthe
 In anger, he also threw away the mobile of a journalist
 chaar din baad jain ne apni baat doharaai or google kaa hawala dete hue kaha ki google bhi kahata he ki chikangunia se kisi marij kii maut nahin hoti
 However, the health minister proved to be a failure when his 'google Knowledge' functionality was checked
 aaropon-pratyaropon kaa daurrajdhani main mahamari ke daur main aaropon-pratyaropon kaa bhi daur jamkar chalaa
 The Delhi government continued to blame the central government and LG for this, citing lack of beds in hospitals, while on the other hand, MCD kept the responsibility of cleaning and fogging
 dilli ke swasthya sachiv kii chuttee ko bhi kejariwal sarkaar ne mudda banaaya
 They said that the LG removed the health secretary previously kept by the Kejriwal government and deliberately sent the health secretary he had created on leave
 dilli sarkaar main mantri kapil mishra ne twit kar kaha, 'alji sahab aap jahaan kahin bhi ho ek baat yaad rakhana, dilli kii janata ke khilaaf aisi napak or criminal sajeesh karne ke liye bhagwaan aapako kabhi maaf nahin karegaa
 'what happened to the Mohalla clinic? After the Supreme Court rebuke, when Health Minister Satendra Jain filed his affidavit, this time also blamed the Health Secretary
 jain ne aarope lagaaya ki chandrakar bharti ne mohalla clinics ko sthapit karne main kabhi dilchaspee nahin dikhaai
 Not only this, the Health Secretary did not consider it necessary to meet me before going on leave and did not attend any meeting even after returning
 ye vahiin satyendra jain hai, jinhone kuch din pehle elaan kiya tha ki mohalla clinics bhi fever clinics kii tarah kaam karenge
 But in the era of dengue and chikungunya, when these mohalla clinics were reality checked, it was found that these clinics are proving inadequate in fighting dengue and chikungunya
 aam aadmi party ne dilli main chunaav se pehle rajdhani main ek hajaar mohalla clinics sthapit karne kaa vaada kiya tha
 Before the election, the broom is the election symbol of the Aam Aadmi Party
 dilli main chunaav se pehle aam aadmi party ke kaaryakarta is chunaav chinh vaali topi pahane haathon main jhaadu liye dilli bhar main ghoomte dikhte rahete the
 They were also seen sweeping from place to place
 lekin ye kaaryakarta agar dengue or chikangunia ke daur main bhi gali-mohallon jhaadu laga dete to shaayad dengue or chikangunia ke machhar fail hi nahin pate
 And today the situation is not so serious
 lekin kejariwal sarkaar ko us dilli kii janata kii kahaan chintaa thi jisane yah sochakar aam aadmi party ko dil kholkar vot diya ki nai sarkaar bani to aam janata ko uske saamne aane vaali musiibat se ab do-chaar nahin hona padegaa
 The Government of Delhi is now dreaming of 'expansion' and the elections in Punjab and Goa are eyeing

 Even though the real estate regulatory bill ie RERA has been implemented from May 1, all the builders and flat buyers of Uttar Pradesh are still confused
 flats byrs association or builder donon hi draft policy naa aane ko lekar kanphyus hai kyonki ab rajya ke paas mahaj 3 maheene kaa vakt he jisamen use tribunel niyukt karne ke saath-saath apni niti nirdhaarit karnaa hoga
 Anu Khan, president of the Flat Buyers Association, says that as of now he does not even know what will come in the draft policy of the state
 khan ko dar he ki kahin draft policy main builder ke paksh main badlaav na kar diya

 The builders are also avoiding saying anything because of no draft policy
 saaya developers ke diarector manoj jain kaa kahana he ki yah act jarur builder or kharidaaron ke bich bharosa kaayam karegaa lekin is act main kya kuch pherbadal ho saktaa he ise lekar logon main dar punap rahaa he

 iske alaava noida or gajiabad main apane flats book kara chuke logon kaa maananaa he ki ek baar yah act puri tarah se lagu ho jayega to graahakon ko pataa hoga ki bilders ke khilaaf koi shikaayat lekar unhen kiske paas janaa hoga
