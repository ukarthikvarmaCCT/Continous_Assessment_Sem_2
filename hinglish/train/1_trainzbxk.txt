 Rahul Gandhi, who was on a two-day visit to his parliamentary constituency Amethi, said in an event that Prime Minister Modi himself took Ambani with him to the delegation and helped him get a contract worth Rs 30,000 crore
 unhone daawa kiya ki pradhanmantri ne 526 karod rupee kaa rafel vimaan 1600 karod main kharidne kaa sauda kiya
 The former French President said that the French company had not given the contract to Ambani, rather the Prime Minister of India had told us that if the Rafale aircraft was to be given, then give the contract to Ambani
 yah nirnay kisi or ne nahin balki khud pradhanmantri ne liya

 So she will meet senior BJP leaders Yashwant Sinha, Arun Shourie, Shatrughan Sinha and other leaders on Wednesday
 isse bijepi kii mushkilen bad sakati hai
 Mamta Banerjee, on a four-day visit to Delhi on the possibility of a Third Front, attacked the BJP fiercely on Tuesday
 unhone kaha ki bijepi sabase zyada sampradayik party he
 Earlier on Tuesday, on the invitation of Mamata Banerjee, the leaders of opposition parties as well as allies of NDA government came to meet
 sansad bhawan main trinmul congress pramukh aurpashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjeene NCP chif sharad pavaar, shivasena ke netaa sanjay raut, samaajawaadee party ke netaa ram gopal yadav, bijedy saansad pinaki mishra, diemke netaa kanimojhi, TDP ke netaa wies choudhary or ram mohan naidu ke alaava rashtriya janata dal kii netaa misa bharti or jepi yadav se mulaakaat kii
 During this, they discussed about creating a third front
 gaiyr-bijepi or gaiyr-congressi raajnneetik dalon se mulaakaat karne ke baad ek sawaal ke jawaab main mamata banerjee ne kaha ki jab raajnneeti se jude log mulaakaat karte hai, to nishchit rup se raajnneeti par charchaa hogi
 Nothing is hidden here
 saal 2019 kaa loksabhaa chunaav behad dilachasp hoga
 TDP MP, Raju Shetty of the Swabhiman Shetkari organization, who was separated from the NDA and BJD MP in Rajya Sabha Anubhav Mohanty, also met Mamata Banerjee along with his wife

 It remains to be seen as to how far the united parties succeed in their objective to counter the BJP in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections
 maharashtra main bijepi-shivasena gathbandhan par aar-paar kii than gai he
 The Shiv Sena has given the final formula to the BJP regarding seat sharing for the assembly elections
 shivasena adhyaksh uddhav thakare ne bijepi par nishaanaa sadhate hue ye bhi kaha, 'hamako baar-baar nicha dikhaane kii koshish naa kii jaae or agar ye khinchataan yun hi jari rahegi to sena ke sher taiyaar hai
 However, the BJP has rejected the Shiv Sena's proposal
 bijepi ne kaha he ki ye faisla avyavhaarik he
 Today is the day of crossing the seat on the sharing of seats between BJP and Shiv Sena in Maharashtra
 bijepi or shivasena ne alag-alag baithak bulaai
 BJP leaders arrived at the party headquarters in New Delhi to meet national president Amit Shah
 baithak main rajeev pratap rudi, om maathur, vinod taavade or devendra fadanvis kii baithak hui
 BJP election committee meeting is also to be held in Delhi in the evening
 isse pehle mumbai ke rang sharada auditorium main shivasena kaarysmiti kii baithak hui
 In this, Uddhav bluntly told the BJP not to try to embarrass Shiv Sena
 uddhav ne kaha, 'loksabhaa chunaav ke vakt hamane bijepi kii baat maani
 During the crisis, Bala Saheb supported the BJP
 ye hamaare astitv kii ladaai he
 In the working committee meeting, Uddhav gave a new formula according to which Shiv Sena will contest on 151 seats and BJP has been asked to contest on 119 seats
 baaki 18 siton ko 4 anya sahyogi dalon ko dene kaa formula sujhaayaa gaya he
 On offering the new formula, Uddhav said that this is his last attempt to save the alliance
 uddhav ne baithak main divangat bijepi netaa gopinath munde ko bhi yaad kiya
 He said that all things were normal in the alliance during Munde
 uddhav thakare kaa bayaan aane ke baad maharashtra bijepi ke netaaon ne dilli main press conference kii
 It is said that there is no last resolution in the coalition
 siton ko lekar tivi channelon ke jariye nahin, balki aamane-saamne honi chahie
 The BJP also said that the 25-year-old alliance should not be broken
 lekin yah bhi kaha ki zyada siten jeetne vaali party kaa siem hona chahie
 The BJP had earlier rejected Shiv Sena's formula, but before this, the efforts of reconciliation have not been successful
 maharashtra bijepi adhyaksh devendra fadanvis or shivasena mukhiya udghav thakare kii baithak benatija rahi
 The BJP rejected the Shiv Sena formula and the Maharashtra BJP president met Uddhav late in the night and expressed his displeasure
 maharashtra bijepi adhyaksh ne uddhav ko bijepi kor cameti kaa faisla sunaaya or shivasena ke prastaav ko khaarij kar diya
 In the new formula, Shiv Sena proposed to reduce its 14 seats
 yani 169 siton ke bajaae 155 siton par chunaav ladane kii peshkash kii thi
 While BJP was given 126 seats
 shivasena kii chodi gai 14 siton main se 7 siten bijepi ke khate main jaaengi jabaki baaki 7 siten swabhimani shetakari sanghathan ko milegaa
 BJP will give its quota seats to RPI
 aisa karne par bijepi kii apni seat 119 se bhi ghat jaaegi
 Significantly, the BJP contested 119 seats in 2009
 yahi vajah he ki bijepi ne shivasena ke formule ko maanane se inkaar kar diya he
 It is believed that now BJP President Amit Shah will speak to Uddhav Thackeray and the seat-sharing deadlock will be removed
 aaj dilli main bijepi sansadeey dal kii baithak bhi honi he jiske baad koi antim faisla hoga

 Jain interpreted this rule differently in the case of Dravid, in which the order that a person belonging to the BCCI occupy only one position is not sufficient to come to the conclusion of a 'conflict of interest'

 Who will be your prime ministerial candidate Rahul Gandhi or Mayawati in the event of hung parliament? In response to this question, Tejashwi Yadav said that i am happy that at least the hung Lok Sabha is being talked about, otherwise people used to talk unilaterally
 lekin aisa kuch nahin hone vaala he
 All the people are angry with Modi ji
 khaastaur par sabhi kshetreey partiyaan apaset hai
 Stunning, when it was asked that six rounds of elections have been held, do you think the BJP has an upper hand? On this, the RJD leader said that we are saying from the beginning that we will not talk about Modi, we will talk about the issue
 unhone kaha ki mudda kya he kisaanon kaa aay doguna hua ki nahin hua? rojgaar ke bare main baat karo, garibi ke bare main baat karo, sanvaidhanik sansthaaen ko jis tarah se modi ji ne hijank kar rakhaa he, main kahata hum ki sabhi sanvaidhanik sansthaaen bijepi ke cell kii tarah kaam kar rahi he

 25 kii ausat se kul 589 ran banaakar test cricket main dhamaakedaar vaapasi kii he
 Former Australian bowler Shane Warne also believes that Smith is the best batsman in the world in Tests
 haalanki bhartiya captain viraat kohli sabhi praroopon main smith par baari padate hai
 Smith was banned for a year due to involvement in the sand paper controversy, but now he has made a strong comeback in Test cricket and has become the number-1 batsman in this format, beating Virat Kohli
 worne kaa maananaa he ki smith test main best hai, lekin khel ke sabhi praroopon ko dekha jaae, to kohli aage najar aate hai or vah mahaan ballebaaj sachin tendulkar ke 100 shatakon kaa record bhi tod denge
 "as far as Test cricket is concerned, i would say that there is a very close match between Virat and Smith," Warne told IANS
 lekin agar mujhe test cricket main ek ballebaaj chunanaa hoga, to vah smith honge
 But even if i go wrong, i will be happy, because Virat is a legend
 'worne ne kaha, 'mujhe lagata he ki viraat duniya ke sarvshereshth ballebaaj hai
 i understand that if i have to choose one batsman in all formats, it will be great
 viv richards vanade cricket main or shaayad sabhi praroopon main duniya ke sabase mahaan ballebaaj the, lekin viraat ab sabase mahaan vanade khilaadi hai
 He has surpassed Viv for me
 'viraat ne antarrashtriya cricket main abtak 68 shatak lagaae hai or won bhi maanate hai ki vah sachin ke record ko tod sakate hai
 Warne said, "yes, i think Sachin's records are in danger
" 708 test wicket hone ke baad mujhe yah sawaal poocha gaya tha ki kya mujhe lagata he ki nathan leone meraa record tod sakate hai
 i hope he is able to do it, as it would mean that he has played good cricket for a long time
 sachin ke saath bhi aisa hi he
 i believe if you ask him if he wants Virat to break his record, he will say yes
 yah dekhnaa bahut mjedaar hoga
 Sachin stay alert Virat is coming to break your record
 'worne ne kaha, 'mujhe lagata he ki vah saare record tod denge or vah jis tarah se apana kaam karte hai uskaa main bahut bada prashansak hum or maine saarvajanik rup se bhi aisa kaha he
 i think Virat is the best batsman in the world in all forms of sports

 When and how our small eyes see big dreams, it is never known
 in sapanom ko dekhne ke baad dil or dimag main shuru hoti he jaddojahad
 One such dream was to make my eyes a fashion designer
 meraa naam komal pandey he or yah baat us samay kii he jab main mumbai shahar main apni padhai kar rahi thi
 It was while studying that i had a heartfelt intention to make a place in the fashion world
 is sapane ko puraa karne kaa vakt bhi aayaa, lekin tabhi papa kaa transfar dilawaalon ke shahar dilli main ho gaya
 Of course i loved this city but the street of my dreams did not pass through here
 phir shuru hui maa-papa ko manaane kii jugat, lekin isamen kaamyaab main nahin ho saki
 Eventually i had to come to Delhi but the dream i had dreamed of came with me from Mumbai to Delhi
 yahaan aakar jab maine papa se baat kii to jawaab yahi mila ki kya jarurat he fishan kii duniya main mukaam banane kii, agar bahut zyada ichha he to koi ghar baithe course kar lo
 i was saddened by this answer, but the intentions became stronger than before
 maine apni job shuru kii or puure saal kii selary se bachat karte hue maine fishan digining ke course main apana admician liya
 My parents were surprised, but this time they could not stop me
 duusari cheez jo mere dimag main thi ki jahaan admician liya, yah wo jagah nahin thi jahaan se training lene ke maine sapane dekhe the
 But to get the land, we need land, then it was just that land
 maine ab pehle semester kii padhai puri kar lee he or apane sapane ko puraa karne main lagi hum
 Not only this, the intention in the heart is also fulfilled that one day the city of dreams that did not stop me going, one day he will call me and my mother and father will also see the colors of my skills on the ramp

 kaash, main ananyaa se milakar unhen bataa saktaa ki unhone kitni khubsuurati se cancer se ladaai kii kahani is kitaab main likhi he
 "read this excerpt from his book 'stop the breathless breath' on Ananya Mukherjee's birth anniversary today: Book excerpt: 'from the head of the living breath' How can a cancer patient dream? It would be dramatic if i saw the terrible faces of fellow cancer patients in my dreams
 main sapane main tarah-tarah ke najaare dekhne kii aadi thi or mujhe kai varshon tak lagaataar train, bas plane chhot jane ke sapane aayaa karte the
 Whatever was happening in them was always a mess
 main ek train par chadhane kii hadabadi main hum par tikat par likhe coach nambar vaala coach kahin nahin he yaa phir main paseene main lathpath plateform par bhaag rahi hum or udhar train plateform se baahar nikal chuki he
 i was not Kareena Kapoor, nor did someone like Shah Rukh Khan move forward with love
 yah to meraa aatmavishvaas tha
 Many times i used to dream of a plane, leaving my restless, my suitcase was not closed
 yaa meraa dost bathroom chalaa gaya he or saath main meraa boarding paas bhi le gaya he or vah waapas nahin aata
 He may have used my boarding pass as toilet paper and he felt ashamed
 par vastav main aisa kuch bhi kabhi nahin hua
 When i am awake, i am always like those boring Bengali travelers who reach the station or airport in a mid-afternoon for a night trip
 apana tikat baar-baar check karte hai
 Lock clothes and accessories one night before
 boarding paas ko aise seene se lagaae rahete hai jaise vah purvajon kaa khajaana ho
 Here Patidev bin Maangi comments that these people roam around in monkey temperatures even with monkey caps
 khayr, aage baat karte hai
 After a year of treatment for my cancer, i started dreaming of travel again
 par is baar mujhe kareeb-kareeb anjaane se lakshya kii ore janaa hota tha, jahaan mujhe kaalikh bhare pani se guzarana hota tha
 In these dreams, i had to find unintentional paths or walk on an uprooted and carved mud road, where the soil was mud
 upar se aksar yah bhi nahin pataa hota tha ki janaa kahaan he
 If i woke up with such dreams, i used to get confused
 iske alaava in sapanom main mere kuch priyajan bhi shaamil hote the, to phir kya chintaa karnaa
 At least i am cool and again for the relief of pain the doctors started giving me morphine tablets
 haalanki is bare main likhit main koi pramaan to nahin hai par kehete hai ki narcotic drugs se ajeeb yaa mayavi se sapane aate hai
 i dreamed that i was crossing several feet high dark green silk-like waves rising in the backdrop of the gleaming sky, going down thirty feet, cruising through a dark escalator and a well-known family held my hand
 brahmad jaise vistrut ghaas ke maidan main cycle chalaa rahi hum, jahaan peeche se kisi kii tej khushnuma awaz aa rahi he - kya tumhen sonic awaajen sunai de rahi hai?main ek charmarati bas kii said main lataki hui hum , andheri raat main chamagadad kii tarah
 On some unknown path among strangers, where the driver unloads us in the middle of the road, some passengers come to the voice, which if you cross this green sea, you will reach Pakistan and i think you will reach hell
 isi tarah ke paagalpan bhare sapane
 But not all dreams are of such dark, so crazy and so unknown places
 ab dekho, us raat maine dekha ki mere bos mere kaam ke bare main feed back de rahe hai ki mere kaam kii gunvattta or gati donon hi turant behatar honi chahie
 i woke up feeling quite right
 kai achche duusare sapanom main main pyaari-si mehfil main bade khushnuma, garmjoshi se bhare glamras logon ke saath chandani raat main badhiya quality kii whisky yaa bear pite hue rabindra sangeet gunagunaati hui dikhti hum
 Where there are waving words, veneers and waving hairs
 mere sapanom main to mere bhi bal hote hai
 Last night i saw Nikita, a very lovely, beautiful and very rich friend of mine
 vah jab bhi dilli se jaipur aati thi, aadha amrapali jewelers kharid leti thi
 i noticed that we are both shopping together and i get a second piece of what she buys
 bas ek galati ho ki is sapane kaa zikr maine kisi din apane pati se kar diya
 He said that he liked the dreams of Pakistan beyond my green sea
 unke vichaar se nikita ko amrapali ke alaava anya chizon ke liye jaipur aana chahie

 Facing accusations of not being face to face in Delhi, the BJP has played a big bet by joining the Kiran Bedico party
 party ne bedi ko laakar ek tir se do nishane saadhe hai
 First- Now Arvind Kejriwal BJP got a face in Delhi
 doosraa- kejariwal aurkiran bedidonon anna andolan se nikle hai, aise main aam aadmi party ke liye unhen nishane par lenaa aasaan nahin rahegaa
 (an open letter to BJP leader Kiran Bedi) In the presence of Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, his inclusion in the party gives many clues in itself
 patrakaron ke saath kiran bedi kaa baatcheet kaa andaaj bhi bhavi siem vaala tha
 There is no doubt that the BJP workers have been excited by his arrival
 to aaie jaanate hai kiran bedi ko party main shaamil karne se bijepi ho sakate hai koun se 5 phaayde?1- desh kii pehali mahila ipies chune jane ke baad se ab tak mahilaon main unki alag chhavi rahi he
 Women safety is also a big issue in Delhi and their image with supercop will definitely work in this way
 vaise kiran bedi kai saal se mahilaon ke liye kaary bhi kar rahi hai
 (these 5 losses will happen to BJP due to Bedi's arrival) 2- Kiran Bedi, like Arvind Kejriwal, has come out of Anna movement and her image is also impeccable
 aise main karpshan ke naam par kejariwal ke liye vot batorna aasaan nahin rahegaa
 In the last assembly election, Kejriwal got the most benefit from the corrupt image of the Congress
 3- aam aadmi party or congress kaaphi samay se bijepi ke paas dilli main cheharaa na hone kaa aarope lagaate aa rahe the
 Kejriwal vs Jagdish Mukhi was being presented in the AAP posters
 yahi kaaran rahaa ki bijepi ne kiran ko party main shaamil karte hi sanket de die ki modi ke baad vahi dilli main party kaa cheharaa hai
 4- At present, issues like love jihad and conversion are dominating in the country, which can cause major damage to BJP in Delhi elections
 kiran bedi raajnneeti main fresh phase hai or vah sangh se bhi judi nahin rahi hai
 In such a situation, the chances of acceptance of Kiran Bedi are more than any other BJP leader
 5- kiran bedi ne party main shaamil hote hi piem modi ke development agenda kii baat kii
 Till now the issue was missing in Delhi, but now Bedi will be able to present herself as an honest representative of PM Modi
 aise main centre or rajya ke bich samanvay kii baat par bharosa bhi kiya ja sakegaa
 For PM Modi, asking for votes from Bedi will be more
