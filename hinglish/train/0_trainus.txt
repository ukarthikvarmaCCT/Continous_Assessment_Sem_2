 What was the disputed statement? Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur, who made objectionable remarks on the martyr Hemant Karkare in the Mumbai terror attack, made a disputed statement about the Babri Masjid
 sadhvi pragna ne kaha tha ki babari masjid kaa dhaancha giraane par unhen afsos nahin, balki garv hota he
 On the question of demolishing the structure of Babri Masjid, Sadhvi Pragya had said, 'why would we regret to demolish the structure, we are proud of it
 ram ke mandir par apshisht padaarth the, unhen hamane hataa diya
 This has awakened the pride of our country and we will celebrate the grand Ram temple '
 unhone khud ye daawa kiya he ki wo babari masjid kaa dhaancha giraane main shaamil thim
 After this, while answering the question of why the Ram temple could not be built, Sadhvi Pragya had said, 'look at the time, it has been 70 years, what have they done and our devasthan too could not be safe
 hinduon ne ikatthe hokar swabhimaan ko jaagrit kiya he dhaancha todakar or bhavy mandir bana karke aradhana karenge'
 Sadhvi Pragya said that if for some reason anyone takes advantage of this medium and it hurts the country, democracy is endangered or security is in danger then such traditions should be relaxed a bit

 BJP withdraws Speaker's candidate; bjp's deal with Uddhav government; Maharashtra's leader Pratipaksham Maharashtra government has passed two tests of stability one after the other
 shanivaar ko uddhav sarkaar ne 169 vidhayakon ke samarthan ke saath bahumat pareekshan hasil kiya, ravivaar ko is sarkaar ne aasaani se apni pasand ke spikar kii niyukti kar lee
 Senior Congress leader Nana Patole was elected Speaker of the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly unopposed on Sunday
 naanaa patoleka nirvirodh chunaav is vajah se sambhav ho sakaa kyonki maharashtra kii pramukh vipakshi party bhartiya janata party ne apane ummidavaar kishan cathore kaa naam waapas le le liya
 Till Sunday morning, there were reports that the BJP would not give a walkover to the Shiv sena-ncp and the Congress for the Speaker's post, but it was suddenly revealed that the BJP was withdrawing the name of its candidate for the Speaker's post
 sawaal ye he ki shanivaar ko vidhansabha main aakraamak rahane vaali bijepi ravivaar ko sarkaar ke prati naram kyon ho gai or apane spikar ummidavaar ko waapas kyon le liya?spikar pad nirvirodh chaahati thi uddhav sarkaardarasal,bijepike is faisle ke bich bijepi kii ek choti si deal he jo party ne maharashtra main satta paksh ke saath kii he
 After passing the majority test, the Maharashtra government wanted the Speaker's election to be uncontested as per Maharashtra tradition
 iske peeche makasad ye tha ki logon kii najaron main sarkaar ko majbootee hasil hoti
 However, the Uddhav government had to convince the BJP for this
 kyonki vidhansabha main bijepi ke 105 sadsy hai, agar gopneey paddati se spikar kaa chunaav hota to voton main jaraa sa her pher bhi uddhav sarkaar ke liye mushkil paidaa ho sakati thi
 Therefore, the Maharashtra government unanimously wanted to elect the speaker
 uddhav sarkaar ke ranneetikaron ne pichhali raat se hi iske liye ranneeti banani shuru kar di
 Contact with BJP was made and his mood was tried
 sarvadaleey baithak main khule rasteravivaar ko spikar chunaav se pehle ek sarvadaleey baithak hui
 Several party leaders including former CM Devendra Fadnavis were present in this meeting
 uddhav sarkaar ne jab bijepi se apane spikar ummidavaar ko saport karne ko kaha to bijepi ne netaa pratipaksh kaa mudda uthaaya
 According to sources, today (december 1), the Leader of the Opposition was not an issue in the Order of the day
 bijepi ne satta paksh se kaha ki agar unhen spikar pad ke liye bijepi kaa samarthan chahie to sadan kii aaj kii kaarywahi main netaa vipaksh kii niyukti ke mudde ko shaamil karen
 According to sources, the government accepted the bjp's demand and agreed to support Congress leader Nana Patole for the post of speaker
 bijepi ke liye kyon jaruri thi netaa vipaksh kii niyuktimaharashtra ke purv siem devendra fadanvis ab maharashtra ke netaa pratipaksh ban gaye hai
 Please tell that today is the last day of the proceedings of the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly
 agar ravivaar ko netaa vipaksh kii niyukti nahin hoti to vidhansabha kaa aglaa seshan shuru hone tak bijepi ko netaa pratipaksh ke pad se dur rahanaa padataa
 The next session of the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly is scheduled to begin in Nagpur

 The BJP leader did not want to give up his rightful title to the opposition in the fragile state of the state
 is vajah se spikar pad ke liye bijepi ne apana ummidavaar waapas lekar sattapaksh ke liye spikar pad kii raah aasaan kar di or ab fadanvis netaa pratipaksh ban gaye hai
 The BJP was weak on the ruling side in terms of strength in the assembly, so it was not possible to become their speaker

 The All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) and the Jamiat ulama-e-hind Review Petition will be pitted against the Supreme Court's decision on the Ayodhya temple-mosque dispute
 iskaa draft taiyaar ho chukaa he
 And it will be filed in the Supreme Court before December 9
 eiempielbi ke edwocket jafarayab jilani sahib kaa kahana he ki rivyuu petishan kaa aadhaar unheen tathyon ko banaaya gaya he jinhen khud supreme court ne mana he
 The biggest ground is that when the Supreme Court believes that in 1949 it was illegal to place the idol at the disputed site, then how did the one-sided decision come? On the other hand, according to Jamiat ulama-e-hind chairperson Arsad Madani, he has only exercised his constitutional right
 madani kehete hai, faisle ke baad mananeey court ne khud kaha tha ki agar koi shankaa ho to is par rivyuu petishan daali ja sakati he
 We have some doubts, just want to finish it
 supreme court is petishan kii sunwaayee kare yaa naa kare yah supreme court kaa faisla he
 When asked that before the verdict came, Jamiat and AIMPLB had said that whatever the court decides we will accept
 lekin ab rivyuu petishan se lagata he ki faisla sweekaar nahin he
 Madani responds, "we (I am talking about jamiyat)
 ) kaha tha ham faisle kaa sammaan karenge
 And putting a review does not mean that we insult the verdict
 ''is rivyuu petishan par supreme court ke vakil or ayodhyaaj ram temple in corts kitaab ke lekhak viraag gupta kehete hai, ''darasal yah rivyuu ke bahaane apil kii ja rahi he jisaki samvidhan ke anuchhed 137 ke tahat ijaajat nahin he

 The US has praised Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's meeting with his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif and senior administration officials have said that they are holding 'cautious' expectations about improving relations between the two South Asian neighbors
 naam jaahir na karne ke anurodh par obama prashasan ke ek varisht adhikari ne kaha, ham saavdhaneepurvak ummid baandhe hue hai ki yah (modi-sharif kii mulaakaat) ek sakaaratmak sanket ho saktaa he, lekin yah baat bhi hamaare dhyaan main hai ki behatar tareeke se aage badhane ke liye yah bahut mahatvapurn hoga
 The official said the administration hopes that the initial signal between Islamabad and New Delhi is positive
 unhone kaha, shapath grahan samaaroh main shaamil hone sambandhi aamantran ko sharif ne sweekaar kiya or kai saal main yah aisi pehali yatra thi
 Speaking of old times, when the BJP came to power in the late 90s during Nawaz Sharif's previous tenure as Prime Minister, there was a remarkable progress in the relationship between the two countries
 adhikari tatkaaleen pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi dwaara kii gai kai shanti pahalon kaa zikr kar rahe the, jinamein se ek dilli-lahore bas seva bhi thi
 He saw further that he is opening the paint and toileting it in the pot of the suit
 The Paper kii khabar ke mutabik, local police ne kaha jaanch ke baad pataa chalaa ki apradhi paas kaa hi dukanvaala he jo unke bijness ko badhata dekh jal gaya tha
 After which he did such a disgusting thing
 uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav dwaara shuru kiya gaya bahupratikshit ‘janata darshan’ kaarykram ab praathamiktaaon se dur ho gaya lagata he
 It has been more than a quarter of a year since the Chief Minister last heard the problems of the public in public
 soochna ke adhikaar (RTI) kanoon ke tahat di gai jaankaree main kaha gaya he ki mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav kaa ‘janata darshan’ kaarykram aakhri baar pichley saal paanch farvari ko hua tha
 In a recent reply to the RTI application filed by RTI activist Sanjay Sharma on 20 February, Yashovardhan Tiwari, in-charge of the Chief Minister's Information Complex, has said that from March 15, 2012 to February 20, 2015, 10 'janta Darshan' programs of the Chief Minister were organized
 soochna ke mutabik pehla janata darshan 18 april 2012 ko hua tha
 There were four more such programs in the same year
 saal 2013 main bhi itane hi kaarykram hue, jabaki varsh 2014 main mukhyamantri keval ek baar hi janata se mili
 It is worth noting that even after three months of response to this RTI, no Janata Darshan program of the Chief Minister has taken place
 akhilesh yadav dwaara khud tay kiye gaye niyamon ke hisaab se dekhen to saal 2012 main unke aise 16 kaarykram yojit hone the, jabaki 2013 or 2014 main 24-24 tathaa is saal ab tak do kaarykram yojit hone chahie the
 But out of these 66, only 10 Janata Darshan programs were organized
 prachand bahumat ke saath 15 march 2012 ko pradesh kii satta sambhalate hi mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ne janata kii samasyaayein sunne ke liye apane pitaamulaayam singh yadavadwara shuru kii gai ‘janata darshan’ kaarykram kii parampara ko dobaaraa jivant kiya tha
 In these programs, the Chief Minister himself met the general public, listened to his grief and pain and instructed the officials concerned to take action on the applications
 aavedak artiai kaaryakarta sanjay sharma ne kaha ki janata darshan kaaryakramon ko lekar aam logon main khaasaa utsaah tha
 Initially this program used to be held on every Wednesday, in which people from all over the state used to come, but later these programs started cutting and it was ordered to be held on the first and third Wednesdays of the month
 haalanki ve kaarykram bhi aksar ‘aprihaary’ kaarnon se talate rahe
 He said that in the shocking reply given by the Chief Minister's Office on the application of RTI activist Urvashi in September 2013, only 26 percent of the applications received in the Janata Darshan program were disposed off
 yah to niraashajanak tha hi lekin baad main mukhyamantri ke ‘janata darshan’ kaarykram hi band ho gaye
 input language gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi ne ‘maataaon or bahanon’ kii suraksha ko bhartiya samaaj ke samaksh ek bada mudda bataate hue kaha ki yadi mahilaayein apane ko asurakshit mahasoos karti hai to bhartiya purushon ko swayan ko ‘mard’ kehane kaa koi adhikaar nahin he
 Addressing a rally in the newly formed district Chhota Udaipur, Modi said, 'the safety of mothers and daughters in Sita and Savitri's country is a big question in Indian society
 ’ unhone navgathit jile ke liye swayan ko sammanit karne ke liye yojit ek kaarykram main kaha, ‘main koi raajnneetik tippanee nahin karnaa chahta lekin main purushon se poochna chahta hum ki hamaari maujuudagi ke baavjood hamaari bahanen shantipurna jivan kyon nahin ji paa rahi hai
 
 : aisa kyon he: hamaari bahanen ghar main akeli kyon nahin rah paatin
 'they said,' If so, we have no right to call ourselves men
 hamen apane ko mard kehane kaa bhi koi adhikaar nahin he
 We should die drowned in shame
 ’ bhaajapa ke chunaav abhiyaan samiti ke adhyaksh modi ne yadhyapi haal kii ghatnaon jaise mumbai gangrape or asaram ke khilaaf lage yon utpeedan ke aaropon ke bare main koi ullekh nahin kiya
 Modi, however, ridiculed those who blame women for these incidents
 unhone kaha, ‘dooshit maansikta vaale kuch purush aise krityon ke liye mahilaon ko jimmedaar tehraate hai
 There is no fault of women
 
 The blame lies in the corrupted minds of men
 samaaj ko aisi dooshit maansikta ke khilaaf ladanaa hoga
 Modi said, "the oppression of women and daughters is a blot on society against which society must fight
" samaaj ko is dhabbe se chhutkaaraa paanaa chahie
 We should take a collective responsibility to get rid of this stain
 ’ unhone saath hi kaha ki yah desh kabhi bhi aisa nahin tha
 These corrupt mindsets are not those with which India is associated
 ’ modi ne is maukey par upie sarkaar par hamalaa bolte hue kaha ki gat 60 varshon se jhuthe vaade karne waalon ke vipareet unki sarkaar ne apane vaade puure kiye
 The small Udaipur district has been carved out of Vadodara
 unhone is maukey par kaha, ‘rajya kaa puraa mahakama aapaki seva ke liye aa gaya he
 The poor and marginalized people will benefit greatly from this
 ’ unhone sthaneey kisaanon ko agle maheene yojit hone vaale wibrant gujarat vaishvik krishi mela main shaamil hone ke liye aamantrit karte hue kaha ki krishi main naveenatam khoj, upkaran or sarvshereshth karypranali kaa pradarshan kiya jayega
 He said, 'farmers would have to travel to Israel for such a fair but Gujarat Sakar decided to organize it in Gujarat so that farmers would not have to travel so far

 Dhoni: The Untold Story is also accompanied by
 vah film main dhoni se gaanaa gavaa rahe hai, naach karvaa rahe hai or unke shauk kaa istemaal apane liye kar rahe hai
 Neeraj, who has made decent films like 'A Wednesday' and 'special 26', seems to miss here and his focus is more on looking into Dhoni's career than in his personal life
 film main dhoni ke sangharsh vaala hissaa bahut hi rochak he
 The film can be said to be a good effort which Sushant Singh has refined from his acting and the events inspired by Dhoni have tried to strengthen the film
 kahani main kitna damafilmaki shuruyaat jharkhand ke ranchi se hoti he
 Where there is a family, headed by Anupam Kher
 unka ek betaa sushant singh rajput yani maahi bhi he jo khel main dilchaspee rakhata he
 But the father wants him to settle down with a government job
 chote shahar ke is ladke ke bade sapane hai
 In this way, all things happening between middle-class families are seen in the father-son
 film kaa yahi part bahut acha bhi he
 Subsequently, Dhoni's journey to cricket is shown
 kaise ek sitare kaa udai hota he
 But here comes his personal life in the film
 diarector itane lambey samay kaa istemaal us tarah se nahin kar sake, jisase yah film yaadgaar ban paati
 Anyway, the specialty of Dhoni has been the team game and this thing seems to be missing somewhere
 ummid thi ki niraj dressing room ke rochakar kisson ko lekar aaenge lekin unhone isko zyada tavajjo nahin di he
 The cricketing scenes in the film are well filmed
 lekin second half thakaata he
 Star Appeal Sushant Singh Rajput has worked hard for Dhoni's character and has also tried his hand at cricket
 unhone dhoni ke kairactor or uski baarikiyon ko achche se samajha he
 His style of speaking is very amazing
 yah unka ab tak kaa behtareen role kaha ja saktaa he
 Anupam Kher has done well in the role of Dhoni's father
 bhoomika chawla ne apane role ko achche se nibhaayaa he
 Kiara and Disha have done exactly what they got
 yuvaraj ke role main harry tangdi achche lage hai
 Mahendra Singh Dhoni is the most successful captain of Indian cricket team and his fan following is tremendous
 unki kahani har ubharate khilaadi or yuva ke liye prerana kaa strot he
 In this way, there is a way to bring the audience, including Dhoni fans, to the cinema once
 film kii laagat lagbhag 110 karod ru
 It is said
 aise main film ko box offis par daud lagaani padegi or film puri tarah se dhoni ke naam par hi tiki he kyonki sushant singh rajput itani bade res ke khilaadi nahin hai
 The music of the film is good, Dhoni's life is fantastic, but the focus on his personal life and the length of the film can definitely tease the audience
 kul milakar niraj pandeya kaa yah 'helicopter short' chakka lagane vaala to najar nahin aata he

 ‘oxford english dictionari’ ke varisht sahaayak sampadak je
 Dent said that every new and revised entry is painstakingly researched
 isse pehle bhi kai bhartiya shabdon ko oxford english dictionari main shaamil kiya gaya he
 Different words such as 'good', 'abba' along with 'anna' of Indian languages have been recognized globally in the Oxford Dictionary
 vahiin hindi bhashaa ke shabd 'acha', 'baapu', 'bada din', 'surya namaskara' aadi ko bhi dictionari main shaamil kiya gaya tha
 Whereas Gulab Jamun, Chilli Masala, Gosht, Keema
 vaise shabdon ko is dictionari main shaamil kiye gaye hai
 This word was created by the Word of the Year Oxford Dictionary, in the year 2018, the word 'TOXIC (toxic)' was declared as Word of the Year
 toxic kaa matlab 'jaharila' hota he
 According to the dictionary, the word refers to the situation, mood and emotion etc
 that emerged in 2018
 bataa den ki saal 2018 main paryaavaran or raajnneetik maahaul ko dekhte hue ye shabd chunaa gaya he

 iskaa arth 'jehar' yaa 'jehar se bharaa' hota he
 Clouds of green gulls, loud thunder of the conch shells, the rain water flowing from the sky, the white saris glowed with lightning, and the water soaked sweetly, the people singing and dancing lost
 guuruuvaar ko chunaav nateezon aane ke baad kolkata main mamata banerjee ke ghar par najaara kuch aisa hi tha
 The exit poll was predicted by the weather in Bengal after the election, but the Trinamool flower will blossom in Bengal in such a way that there will be such a torrential rain of votes for Mamta Dee, maybe the leaders of Trinamool Party Would not have even thought
 aakhir narda-sharada ke naaron kaa shor is tarah kaise gum ho gaya? trinmul ke khilaaf bhrashtachar ke jin aaropon kaa jaalaleft or congresane mil kar buna tha, use mamata banerjee ne itani aasaani se kaise kaat diya? ham aapako bataate hai mamata banerjee ke tarkash ke wo paanch tir, jinase bengal main vipaksh ke is jaal ko unhone taar-taar kar diya

 chaaval do rupee kiloho saktaa he ki bengal ke baahar ke zyaadaatar logon ne rajya sarkaar kii 'khaadya saathi skim' ke bare main suna bhi nahin ho
 But the truth is that if there was any biggest reason behind the victory of Mamta Banerjee, then it was this scheme
 is skim ke tahat bengal main zyaadaatar pariwaron ko do rupee kilo se hisaab se har maheene pachchis kilo chaaval diya jaataa he
 The scheme was introduced just six months before the election, but was implemented so vigorously that people from villages took advantage of it
 bengal garib rajya he or yahaan logon kaa mukhya aahaar hi chaaval he
 When people accustomed to being in the line of ration saw that two rupees a kilo of rice was being found so easily, then they forgot about narada-sharda and became happy with Mamta

 Electricity from house to house, when Buddev Bhattacharya of didcpm was the Chief Minister of West Bengal, his Chief Secretary was Manish Gupta
 mamata banerjee ne unke hunar ko pahachaanaa or 2011 main unhen apni party kaa tikat dekar jadhavpur se buddadev ke khilaaf hi chunaav lada diya
 Mamta's bet was right
 wo jeet kar vidhansabha pahunche to bijli vibhaag kii kaman unhen saunp di
 Manish Gupta did such a great job of sending electricity to every village of Bengal that Didi's water supply was sustained
 is baar manish gupta khud to chunaav haar gaye, lekin har koi maanata he ki unhone gaanv-gaanv bijli ke khambhe is tarah gaad die the, jis par aaj trinmul kaa jhanda laharaa rahaa he

 narda-sharada banaam shandaar sadakentuti-phooti or gadde vaali sadak ke aadi ho chuke bengal ke logon ne sochaa bhi nahin tha ki wo farrata bharti gadiyon main safar kar sakenge
 There was an uproar when a bridge fell in Kolkata
 lekin bengal ke dur daraaj ke ilaakon main pichley paanch saalon main itani sadaken baniin, pul bane ki logon ko bharosa ho gaya ki or paanch saal mila to bachi khuchi sadaken bhi ban jaaengi
 Congress leaders also believe that there has been a lot of improvement in the last five years in terms of roads in Bengal
 jahaan tak rahi mamata sarkaar ke mantriyon par lage lage bhrashtachar kii baat, bengal ke ek varisht patrkaar bataate hai ki yahaan log iske aadi ho chuke hai
 People feel that 34 years left leaders did the same, then the Mamta government has only five years
 sipiem ke netaa sooryakanth mishra kehete hai ki sharada narda kaa mudda bekaar nahin tha
 But why it did not work, the party will consider it

 Didi Vs Who? The militant image of Mamata Banerjee on one side, the ability to do politics by going down the street, from village to house, and on the other side, silence in the anti-faction camp in the name of the Chief Minister
 na koi joardaar naam, na koi lubhaavna cheharaa
 Left leaders believe that if they had a face like Jyoti Basu against Mamta, the matter would have been different
 lekin wo karte bhi to kya karte, left-congress ke paas koi aisa cheharaa tha hi nahin jise mamata ke mukaable utaara ja sake
 Even if the alliance of the Left Congress was not done, saying that neither the people of both the parties could come together in the end, then what would the public have come together
 congress ke pradesh adhyaksh adheer ranjan choudhary maanate hai ki ham bengal main congress ke saath lard rahe the or kerala main unheen ke khilaaf
 In such a situation, our compulsion alliance could not win the trust of the people

 Mahaleftamata Banerjee understood the secret that everyone likes the free thing compared to the Left
 isliye skulon main bacchon ko muft juute die gaye
 The school children were given free bicycles under the Sognath Sathi Scheme
 kanyashri skim ke tahat ladakiyon ko scolership banti gayi
 To win the hearts of the youth, a lot of money was distributed to the clubs of the locality
 or sab par baari do rupye kilo chaaval kii skim
 In the matter of winning the heart by directly benefiting the poor, Mamta adopted the policy of not only the left, but also four steps ahead of them
 left ne kai naaron ko mamata jameen par utaarne main kaamyaab rahi
 Not only this, in making his cadre aggressive in every village, from police and contracting to turning the entire system for his own benefit, in many cases like Malda for the sake of vote, Mamata went more left than left
 adheer ranjan choudhary kehete hai ki bengal kii raajnneeti main main power or masal power kaa jor to hameshaa se tha, is baar mani power kaa aisa tandav hua jo bengal main ajtak kabhi nahin hua
 But the verdict of the people of Bengal says that Mamta is reaping the crop that the Left had sown
 afsos karne ke liye congress or left ke netaaon ke paas ab puure paanch saal hai
 Till then, in Bengal, cool, cool, cool, house to house, Trinamool

 yaadon kii chamakili pattiyaan jharti hai
 Gogoi's mother has printed a book called Hovoronit Rongin Pat in Assamese
 iskaa arth he—yaadon kii chamakili pattiyaan
 That pleasant evening of September 15 was filled with excitement and thrill when 84-year-old Shanti Gogoi, glowing in a white and golden mekhela-chadar, released her autobiography at the Garden Treat Hotel in Dibrugarh, Assam
 kamare main maujuud logon ne kohniyon se ek duusare ko ishaara kiya or fusfusaate hue kaha, "ve vahaan hai
 "he is the person who sat in the front row with unwavering patience and restraint
" fusfusaahaten jari raheen, "ve apni maa ke book launch ke liye itani dur se aae hai;'' "bharat ke pradhan nyaayadhish banane ke mahaj do din baad;'' "uttar-purv ke pehle pradhan nyaayadhish
 The mother proudly looked at the son and called him "his Lordship" with some mockery and some seriousness
 unke paanch bacchon main duusare number ke ranjan gogoi ne unki jindagi kii kitaab main beshak ek rang-birangaa panna joda he
 No matter how heavy the rights and powers are in their hands, judges do not live a colorful life
 ve chakachaundh se dur khamoshi se apana kaam karte hai or keval apane faislon kii jabaan main bolte hai
 Yet on October 3, when he takes over the chair of the 46th head of the "world's most powerful court", then there is every chance that Chief Justice Gogoi will be a judge of a different kind
 bhala koun 12 janvari kii vah taarikh bhul saktaa he, jab sheersh adaalat ke teen anya sabase bade jajon ke saath unhone ek abhootpurv press conference kii thi or supreme court ke andruni kaamkaaj ko lekar saarvajanik virodh darj kiya tha
 No one can deny the apprehensions that gripped the entire nation after this press conference — will they become the next CJI, or not? The question is — with the 64-year-old CJI taking over, will the Supreme Court be able to live as it was? The court's view says to young lawyers, "expect fireworks in the court
" '' nyaayamurti gogoi abujh shaks kii tarah baithte hai, unka cheharaa bhavashunya hota he
 But his calm gestures and stubborn questions are particularly intimidating to lawyers

 s
 karnan ke khilaaf avmaananaa ke adhikaron kaa istemaal kiya tha
 Still, when he leans a little further and goes deeper into the facts of the case closely, his shrill tone also kills the court's often patient debates
 bade vakil sijei ko kai sari tarifon se navajte hai—doordarshee, bedaag nyaayik record, swatantra, khulaa dimag, asaadhaaran or saahsee
 Their intention is this: There is every possibility that Justice Gogoi will retain full control over his court
 vah bhi is chunavi saal main or rajnatik rup se mahatvapurn kai pechida maamalon ke bich—ayodhya kii jameen kii milkiyat lekar assam main naagarikta register or kai anya maamalon tak—jo supreme court ko siyaasi chinagaari bhadkaa sakate hai
 It is said that the balance and order are the most important for CJI Gogoi
 unhen chizon ko jyamitiya samarupata yaa santulan main vyavasthit karnaa pasand he—chaahe ve filein hon, kaam kii jagah, yaa furniture
 It is not too surprising
 samarupata kanoonee vyavhaar main jitani ahm avadharana he, management ke siddhanton main bhi utana hi prabal vichaar he
 It may have been the obsession of symmetry that made him a top-class chess player, because a balanced position in expert hands can be the antidote in this game

 In the last 40 years, some of the most difficult and tedious battles of the nation have been fought between its two pillars, the judiciary and the executive, who can "judge the judges"
 2015 se, jab supreme court ne jajon kii niyukti kii collegium pranali ko badalakar uski jagah modi sarkaar ke prastaavit rashtriya nyaayik niyukti ayog (engeesi) ko khatm kar diya tha, ek sanvaidhanik sankat bheetar hi bheetar khadbadata rahaa he
 At the same time, the collegium system is also not complete
 engeesi par faisla sunaane vaali peeth ke sadsy rahe nyaayamurti (sevanivrutt) je
 According to Chelameswar, the collegium lacks "transparency, accountability and objectivity"

 For the past 4 days, the reason of emergency-like situation is being told to be jammed on 31st and 1st date

 Because of this, pollution persists for a long time

 lekin railway board or iske adhikari pradhanmantri ko is baat kaa bharosa nahin dilaa paae ki itane mahange signling system se railway ko kitna phayda hoga or aam aadmi ko iskaa kya phayda mil paaegaa
 According to Railway Board officials, the signaling system across the country needs to be upgraded

 This will increase automation in signaling and minimize human interference
 gauratlab he europe main hai speed ke liye signal system puri tareeke se automatic he
 Many European countries have proposed to bring such systems to India

 janata dal (you) ke rashtriya sachiv virendra singh bidhudi ko dilli kii ek adaalat ne chori ke maamle main ek saal ke karawas kii sajaa sunai he
 The court said he was not entitled to be released on probation as he failed to learn a lesson despite being convicted in other criminal cases
 atirikt satr nyaayadhish rajendra kumaar shastri ne aadesh diya ki virendra ko jail kii sajaa kaatane ke liye hiraasat main liya jaae

" ’ virendra haal main dakshin dilli se nirvaachit bhaajapa ke saansad ramesh bidhudi ke bhai hai
 The court said, 'in modern civilized society, the aspect of reform is being given more importance
 zyada naram or zyada kathor donon sajaaen apni prabhavakaarita kho detii hai
 One does not stop crime and the other disappoints, which makes the culprit a felony
 ’ nyaayadhish ne kaha, ‘meri raay main prativaadee sankhya 2, aaropee (virendra) ne kam se kam do aapraadhik maamalon main doshi tehraae jane ke baavjood koi sabak nahin siikhaa

 madhya pradesh ke mana gaanv main ek dalit kii beti kii dhoomdhaam se hui shaadi ko bamushkil haftaa bhar hi hua he, lekin yahaan ke dalit pariwaron ko baari pareshaani se rou-ba-rou hona pad rahaa he
 Kisan oil was suddenly found in the well from which 500 Dalits used to fill water
 daliton ne prashasan ko tatkaal isaki soochna di, jiske baad kuen se pump ke jariye kiraasana tel mila pani nikaala gaya
 It appears that kerosene oil was deliberately poured into the well
 daliton kaa kahana he ki chunki chander meghavaal naamak shaks ne daliton kii dhamkee ko nazarandaaj kar apni beti kii shaadi khub dhoomdhaam se kii thi, isi ke badale ke taur par dabangon ne kuen ke pani ko kharaab karne kii sajeesh kii
 It is worth mentioning that for the first time after independence in the Mana village of Agar Malwa area on April 23, a marriage procession was taken out with a band baje at the wedding of a couple of Dalit society, but for this the government had to deploy armed police force
 jila mukhyalay se lagbhag 40 kilometre dur susner tehsil antargat is gaanv main aazaadee ke baad se lekar aaj tak kabhi bhi dalit samaaj ke vivaah kaarykram main band baaje evam dhol-dhamaake nahin baj paae the, jabaki 2,000 aabaadi vaale is gaanv main lagbhag 55 dalit parivaar nivas karte hai
 Chander Meghwal's daughter Mamta was married to Dinesh of Rajgarh and was supposed to attend the wedding on 23 April 2017
 lekin gaanv ke dabangon ne chander ko chetavanee di ki gaanv main baraat bina band baaje ke nikalni chahie or naa hi kisi prakaar kii sajaavat-roshni honi chahie
 Chander appealed to the administration for protection, after which Mamata's baraat came to the village at the scheduled time, and with the band Baje, Barat Chander reached Meghwal's house and with great pomp, Mamta was married to Dinesh
 is dauraan teen thanon ke police bal puri mustaidi ke saath vahaan par maujuud rahe
 The comments shaadi se pehle chander meghavaal ko dabangon dwaara chetavanee di gai thi ki agar usne 'niyamon' ko todaa to uske parivaar ko kuen se pani nahin bharne diya jayega or na hi sthaneey mandir main pravesh karne diya jayega
 Meghwal said that since the rest of the Dalit families had also openly supported his daughter's marriage with pomp, the entire Dalit community has been targeted
 usne kaha, ham sab pani ke liye isi kuen par ashrith hai
 
 
 They put kerosene oil in it
 kuen kaa pani kharaab ho jane ke chalate dalit pariwaron kii mahilaon ko pichley chah dinon se do kilometre dur jaakar nadi se pani laana padataa he
 Although a senior administrative officer has assured that two hand pumps will be installed in the Dalit area, it will take some time
 ek varisht adhikari durvijay singh ne kaha ki kuen main kiraasana tel daalana 'koi bahut bada mudda' nahin he, kyonki is gaanv main vibhinn samudaay ke log kaaphi meljol se rahete hai
 Certainly someone deliberately did such an act
 jo bhi iske liye jimmedaar he, uski pahchaan jald saamne aa jaaegi
 Dalits say that since a man named Chander Meghwal ignored the threat of Dalits and married his daughter with great pomp, the Dabangs conspired to spoil the well's water
 ullekhneey he ki 23 april ko agar malwa kshetra ke mana gaanv main aazaadee ke baad pehali baar dalit samaaj ke ek yugal kii shaadi main band baaje ke saath dhoomdhaam se baraat nikaali gai, lekin iske liye sarkaar ko sashastr police bal tainaat kerani padi
 In the village under Susner Tehsil, about 40 km from the district headquarters, since independence, till date, the band had not been able to play the band and drumming in the marriage program of the Dalit society, while in this village of 2,000 population, about 55 Dalit families Reside in chander meghavaal kii beti mamata kaa vivaah rajgad ke dinesh ke saath tay hua tha or 23 april 2017 ko var paksh baraat lekar mana aane vaala tha
 But the domineering of the village warned Chander that the procession in the village should go out without a band and no decoration or lights of any kind
 chander ne prashasan se suraksha kii guhaar lagaai jiske baad nirdhaarit samay par mamata kii baraat gaanv main ai or band baaje ke saath baraat chander meghavaal ke ghar pahunchi or dhoomdhaam se mamata kaa vivaah dinesh ke saath sampann hua
 During this time, police forces of three police stations were present there with full vigor
 tippaniyan Before the wedding, Chander Meghwal was warned by the overbearing that if he broke the 'rules', his family would not be allowed to fill water from the well nor enter the local temple
 meghavaal ne kaha ki chunki uski beti kii shaadi dhoomdhaam se karne main baaki dalit pariwaron ne bhi khulkar samarthan diya tha, isliye puure dalit samudaay ko nishaanaa banaaya gaya he
 He said, we all depend on this well for water
 
 
 unhone isamen kiraasana tel daal diya
 Due to the water in the well, the women of Dalit families have to go two kilometers away from the river and bring water from the river for the last six days
 haalanki ek varisht prashasnic adhikari ne aashwaasan diya he ki dalit ilaake main do handpump lagaae jaaenge, lekin isamen thodaa vakt lagegaa
 a senior official Durvijay Singh said that pouring kerosene oil in the well is not a 'very big issue' as people from different communities live in this village very closely
 nishchit rup se kisi ne jaanboojhkar aisi harakat kii he
 Whoever is responsible for this, his identity will be revealed soon

 Trump has hoped for an 'extraordinary' relationship before he starts meeting Putin
 america or china ke bich vivaadon se khadey hue trade war ke bich yah mulaakaat behad ahm maani ja rahi he or vaishvik maamalon ke jaankaron kaa daawa he ki is mulaakaat ke parinaam kaa asar duniya ke kai kshetron par padane kaa asaar he
 When asked about his meeting with Putin, Trump said it was a very good start

 During this meeting, translator was present in the room besides these two
 vahiin roosi raashtrapati putin ne kaha ki rus ne kabhi bhi america chunaavon main hastkshep nahin kiya
 The meeting between the two presidents took place at the Rashtrapati Bhavan in Helsinki, the capital of Finland
 roosi media ne putin ke saath baithak se pehle trump kii tarif karte hue kaha he ki is kavayad se donon desh ek duusare ke najadik aaenge or ek saath kaam kar sakenge
 The meeting of the two leaders was kept full confidentiality

 Trump during this time addressed Chinese President Xi Jinping as a friend of America and Russia
 trump ne daawa kiya ki is mulaakaat se pehle vah puri tarah se aashwast hai ki puri duniya america or rus ko ek saath dekhnaa chahta he
 Trump said that America and Russia have 90 percent of the world's nuclear weapons and that is a good thing but a very unfortunate fact
 lihaaja, trump ne sanket diya ki putin ke saath mulaakaat main vah is vishay main kuch ahm faisla karne kii koshish karenge
 However, in the media discussion before the meeting began, Trump said nothing about Russia's interference in the US election and Russia's favor on the issue of Syria, North Korea and Ukraine
 isse saaf he ki is mulaakaat se pehle trump ne puri saavdhaanee barti he jisase donon netaaon ke bich vaarta se pehle kisi tarah kaa vivaad na hone paae

 Jagdale said, 'I cannot comment on legal things
 rajasthan royles ke bhagya par faisla karnaa sanchaalan parishad or kaaryakari samiti par nirbhar karata he
 He said that now the time has come that BCCI should take a lesson from these disputes and clean the system rapidly

 He said, "there are people who are able to take decisions in BCCI
" aise faislon ko jald hi liya janaa chahie
 Former BCCI secretary Jaywant Lele said that despite being a wealthy businessman, Raj Kundra's involvement in betting was 'stupid'
 unhone kaha, ‘jab tak bharat sattebaaji ko vaid nahin karata, yah aparaadh he

 buudhvaar ko pradhanmantri narendra modi ne morabi main raily ke dauraan machhu dam haadase ke baad tatkaaleen pradhanmantri indira gandhi ke daure ko lekar jabardast hamal bolaa
 She said that when Indira visited Morbi, she came with a handkerchief on her nose
 piem modike is bayaan ke baad morabi haadase kii yaaden phir se taaji ho gai hai
 On 11 August 1979, due to the heavy rains, the Machhu Dam located in Morbi district of Gujarat was broken
 iske baad dekhte hi dekhte puraa shahar pani main dub gaya or tabaahi much gai thi
 According to Wikipedia, it killed about 25,000 people
 is haadase main puraa shahar malbe main tabdeel ho chukaa tha or chaaro ore sirf laashe najar aa rahi thim
 a few days after this horrific accident, when Indira Gandhi visited Morbi, the smell of corpses was so much that she had to put a napkin in her nose
 insaanon or pashuon kii laashen sad chuki thim
 At that time, the leaders who visited Morbi and those engaged in relief and rescue work also succumbed to the disease
 shavon ke sadane se halaat badtar ho chuke the or mahamari fail rahi thi
 Leaders visiting the area and those engaged in relief work had made various complaints, including headache
 shavon kaa ek saath antim sanskaar kiya ja rahaa tha
 The city of Morbi was transformed into a crematorium
 us samay gujarat ke mukhyamantri babu bhai patel the
 Prior to 2005, according to the Guinness Book of Records, the accident was considered to be the most disturbed due to the breaking of the dam
 sarkari aankadon ke mutabik machhu dam haadase ke baad insaanon ke 1,137 shav or jaanwaron ke 2,919 shav baraamad hue the
 Also, there was a loss of about 100 crores at that time
 jin logon ne tabaahi ke is manjar ko dekha tha, wo aaj bhi isko yaad karke sihar uthte hai
 However, today Morbi is again in the race for development
 gujarat vidhansabha chunaav ko lekar siyaasi rassakasi bhi jari he
 In this context, by referring to the Morbi incident, PM Modi has not only targeted Indira Gandhi, but has also tried to put the Congress in the dock

 Senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader LK Advani said on Saturday that the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) will participate in the all-party meeting convened by the Prime Minister on June 3 to discuss the Lokpal Bill
 vidheyak par charchaa ke liye hui rajg netaaon kii baithak ke baad patrakaron se baatcheet main adwani ne kaha, "pradhanmantri dwaara teen june ko bulaai gai sarvadaleey baithak main rajg shaamil hoga or vah vidheyak par apni baat rakhega
 "he said whatever the NDA had to say about the bill would say during the meeting
 adwani ne kaha ki rajg kaa sahyogi ghatak shivasena sarvadaleey baithak main shaamil nahin hoga
 It is to be known that this meeting of the NDA took place a day before the all-party meeting called by the Prime Minister

 According to analysts, it is India's diplomatic move to favor BIMSTEC in place of SAARC countries in Modi's swearing-in ceremony
 bharat bimsetak ke sadasyon ko nyotaa dekar yah sandesh dena chahta he ki uske liye padosi desh pehali praathamikta he
 It is believed that the leaders of SAARC countries have not been invited to keep Pakistan away from the swearing-in ceremony
 pakistan ko nyotaa nahin dekar bharat ne jataa diya he ki modi ke duusare kaarykaal main bharat usase duuri banaae rakhega, jabaki anya padosi deshon se acha sambandh bana rahegaa
 Significantly, after the Pulwama attack, relations between India and Pakistan started to get bitter
 bharat ne pulavama hamale ke baad sargical strike ke jariye pakistan ke balakot main jaish-e-mohammad ke aatanki thikaanon ko tabah kar diya tha
 Since then, India has repeatedly warned Pakistan that India will keep its distance until it stops sheltering terrorists on its land
 saath hi apni ranneeti se use duniya main alag-thalag bhi karata rahegaa
 These three countries are not included in BIMSTEC, Maldives, Afghanistan and Pakistan
 piem modi ne maldive ko pehle videsh daure ke liye chunaa he
 Whereas India has an old relationship with Afghanistan which will continue
 bharat ne shapath grahan ke liye morishas ko bhi nyotaa bheja he
 Diplomatic analysts believe that this has given a strong message to Pakistan

 Even though the fundamentalist groups and terrorist bosses have not got a single seat in this general election this time in Pakistan, the terrorists are once again making great preparations to execute their plans against India

 According to the information, there were around 400 casualties on the launch pad before the election in Pakistan, but as the elections were over, the number of terrorists to infiltrate has increased
 ab in aatankiyon kii sankhya 600 ke aasapaas ho gai he
 According to sources, this time the number of terrorists of terrorist organizations like Al Badar is being increased on the launching pad
 al badar ke aatankiyon ko pioke main maujuud lashkar, jaish or hijbul mujahiddeen ke aatanki campon main trend kiya gaya he
 According to the information, during the elections in Pakistan, there were about four radicals who had some form of connection with terrorist organizations
 in aatanki sanghathanon main pioke main maujuud apane aatankiyon ko chunaav ke dauraan kai jagahon par kaam par laga liya tha
 According to sources, the parties which had links with the terrorists included organizations like Allah Hu Akbar Tehreek, Ahle Sunnat Vall Jamaat, Tehreek Labbak Pakistan and Madhita majlis-e-amal

 Sources reveal that the maximum number of jaish-e-mohammed militants in this area has been gathered by the Pakistan intelligence agency ISI

 sutron ke mutabik pakistan kii khufia agency iesai kii madad se paak adhikrut kashmir ke lonching pad par bhi al -badar ke aatankiyon ko bhejne kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 This is the reason that during the infiltration, in the month of June, Indian security forces had piled up two terrorists on the Line of Control who were terrorists of Al Badr

 Who is the master of fixing? This big question has emerged from the new revelations
 vindu daara singh kii giraftaar ke baad isscandle main kai nae hai profile namaubhre hai
 Former Bollywood actress, two actresses
 
 a former cricketer who is now a commentator
 
 
 lekin, sabase bada khulaasa hua he vindu daara singh se bisisiai ke adhyaksh shrinivasana ke damaad gurunath mayppan ke conection ko lekar
 The connection is such that Mumbai Crime Branch is about to interrogate Meiyappan
 to kya abhi or gade murde baahar aaenge?vindu daara singh kii giraftaar se pehle tak kisi ko bhi gumaan nahin tha ki team india ke captain mahendra singh dhoni kii patni sakshi ke saath vindu kii maujuudagi spot phixing scandle main hadakamp machaa degi
 On April 6, when people saw these pictures during the telecast of the match, it was felt that as a celebrity, Vindoo must have reached the VIP box
 kahin cricket se uth naa jaae darshakon kaa bharosaalekin ab is tasviir kaa ek badrang pahalu saamne he, jiske bare main shaq jataayaa ja rahaa he kahin ye spot phixing scandle kii jaanch ko us mukaam tak naa pahunchaa de, jahaan cricket kii sachai se phans kaa bharosa hi darak jaae
 Investigation till now has revealed that
 
 
 - vindu daara singh chennai super kings ke siio gurunath mayppan ke kareebi logon main hai
 - Another great thing about Gurunath Meiyappan is that he is the son-in-law of BCCI President n Srinivasan
 - vindu ne ek akhbaar ko khud hi bataaya tha ki gurunath ke bulaave par hi wo viipi box main pahunche the
 According to sources, Vindu has admitted that he has known Gurunath Meiyappan for the last two years and often talks on the phone between the two
 vindu-gurunath ke rishte par police ko shakyaha tak to thik he ki gurunath mayppan ke saath vindu kii najdiki thi, is naate wo match dekhne pahunche or donon ke bich baatcheet hoti thi
 However, when Mumbai Crime Branch explored the pattern of their conversation, their senses were blown away and according to sources, the Mumbai Police is aware of the betting racket in this life
 - krime branch ke sutron ke mutabik vindu match ke dauraan mayppan ko lagaataar kol karte the
 - Not only this, after talking to Meiyappan, Vindoo used to call Ramesh Vyas in one of the big bookies in Mumbai
 - sawaal uthta he ki aakhir aisi kya baat hoti thi ki mayppan se baat karne ke baad vindu turant buki ramesh vyas se baat karte the?- kya iskaa rishta sattebaaji yaa phixing se he?kya bisisiai pramukh ke damaad bhi hai doshi?mumbai krime branch ko mayppan-vindu-ramesh vyas ke kol ricard kaa pattern pareshaan kar rahaa he
 According to police sources, this is not just an issue of a conversation but they have enough evidence to establish Gurunath's role in the racket
 yahi vajah he ki is bare main saman bhejkar sidhe gurunath mayppan se poochtacha kii taiyaari ho rahi he
 On the other hand, regarding Saman, Meiyappan says that he is busy now and will come next week
 philhal kisi nattejey par pahunchnaa jaldbaaji hoga, lekin agar mumbai police kaa shaq sahi sabit hota he to phixing scandle kaa aisa khulaasa hoga, jiske chhinte bade-bade logon ko daagdar kar sakate hai
 Suspicious sources of Ajit Chandila helping the bookies abroad on the expensive hobbyists said that Vindu Dara Singh was in touch with the bookies even after the spot-fixing scandal
 vindu ke pawan jaipur or sanjay jaipur naam ke sattebaajon se sampark hone kii baat saamne ai he
 Who have now fled to Dubai
 police ko shaq he ki sattebaajon ko dubai bhagane main vindu daara singh ne madad kii thi
 On Tuesday night, Mumbai Police's Crime Branch raided Vindu Dara Singh's Juhu home, in view of the investigation into fixing of raids at Vindu Dara Singh's house
 is dauraan vindu ke ghar se ek leptop or mobile jabt kiya gaya
 Sakshi Dhoni may be interrogated? After the arrest of Bollywood actor Vindu Dara Singh, it is reported that the Crime Branch of Mumbai Police can also interrogate Sakshi Dhoni, wife of Mahendra Singh Dhoni, the captain of Indian cricket team

 Earlier, Himanshu has also topped Chemistry and Astronomy Olympiad
 ab ve antarrashtriya str par hone vaale is olympiad main desh kaa pratinidhitiv karenge jiske liye unhen homi bhabha research centre main baqayda training di jaaegi
 In a conversation with NDTV, Himanshu said that he continued to study for 6-7 hours regularly
 beshak unhone FIITJEE se taiyaari kii he lekin unka maananaa he ki koching karne yaa nahin karne kaa faisla chaatr ko apni kshamta or koching se milane vaale phaayde ke vishleshan ke baad hi lenaa chahie
 Sometimes it happens that in the name of coaching, the benefit is less and time is more wasted
 JEE ko lekar apni stritegi kii charchaa karte hue himanshu bataate hai ki physics kii taiyaari ke liye ech si verma kii kitaab ko aadhaar bana sakate hai
 Also NCERT and coaching materials can be used
 chemistry kii taiyaari ko lekar unka kahana he ki aapako chemistry ke liye NCERT par nirbhar rahanaa chahie lekin in-organic chemistry main riection ko samajhane ke liye kisi achche teacher kii jarurat ho sakati he
 If you have time, you can also read the books of foreign writers
 lekin aapke liye NCERT hi sabase ahm honi chahie 
 Talking about Mathematics, he said that practice matters more than theory here
 algebra, calculas sahit sabhi chapter ke liye kisi ek reference book se hi practice kerani chahie saath hi agar koching kar rahe hon to santhaan kii taraf se die gaye material se bhi practice kerani chahie
 Himanshu, who came to All India Rank 2, says that students in Mathematics usually ignore NCERT
 lekin kam se kam ek baar iske saare sawaal hal jarur karne chahie
 Sharing his experience, he said that to solve the question in Mathematics, one should practice by writing instead of speaking
 bhale hi isamen samay thodaa zyada lagegaa lekin galatiyon kii sambhaavna kam ho jaaegi
 Regarding the preparation of the board and preparing for the JEE, Himanshu believes that if you are preparing for the JEE, then the preparation of your physics, chemistry and maths will be done simultaneously for the board
 angreji or duusare vishyon kii taiyaari aap chhuttiyon ke alaava parikshaon ke bich ke dinon main bhi kar sakate hai
 Regarding his success, Himanshu says that after a good performance in JEE Main, he was confident that success will definitely be found
 ve maanate hai ki unhen parivaar, koching santhaan or doston kaa bhi unhen puraa sahyog mila
 He considers his x factor to be the reason behind coming at number two in the national level examination

 The controversy over the Rajya Sabha elections in JDU does not seem to stop at present
 nitish kumaar ne un netaaon ko saaf-saaf kah diya he ki jinhen rajyasabha nahi bheja gaya, unhen lok sabha chunaav ladane kaa ofer diya gaya he par ye ofer, khulaa ofer nahin he or party lambey samay tak unke jabaab kaa intjaar nahin kar sakati

 baharhaal mana ja rahaa he ki ye netaa agar chunaav nahin ladane kaa faisla karenge to nitish ke khilaaf morcha kholenge
 Sensing this, JDU has given an ultimatum of sorts

 Whereas JDU state president Vashistha Narayan Singh said that you cannot wait long

 Prior to this decision of the President, the BJP also requested that the President postpone the Bihar tour, because on October 27, there is a Narendra Modi's Hunar rally in Patna and it will get stuck due to the President's visit
 aaj hi bijepi ke do netaaon shahanvaj hossain or rajeev pratap rudi ne raashtrapati se mulaakaat kii thi
 BJP leader Shahnawaz Hussain said, "the President told us that he will attend the convocation on the 26th, but will return to Delhi on the same day
" modi kii 27 aktubar ko patna main hone vaali raily ke din hi shahar main raashtrapati kaa kaarykram rakhe jane ko lekar bhaajapa or uske purv sahyogi jadyu ke bich tikhi takaraar hui
 The BJP alleged that the Nitish Kumar government deliberately put up the President's program to disrupt Modi's rally
 rudi ne kaha, bhaajapa ke netaa 26 aktubar ko patna main raashtrapati pranab mukherjee kaa swaagat karenge
 It is an honor for the BJP to welcome the President of India one day in Bihar and the next day the future Prime Minister of India
 bhaajapa ne kaha ki modi kii raily kii taarikh 20 march ko hi ghoshit kar di gai thi or aise main nitish sarkaar kaa kartavya tha ki raashtrapati kaa kaarykram tay kiye jate samay unhen is tathy se avgat karaayaa jaataa, jo usne nahin kiya

 '' The fast-unto-death of ex-servicemen at Jantar Mantar in Delhi on One Rank One Pension has now entered in the second week and none of the government representatives have come even to meet the ex-servicemen
 jabaki congress kii ore se purv raksha rajya mantri jitendra singh or phir haryana ke mukhyamantri bhupinder singh hooda apana samarthan de gaye
 In such a situation, the anger of the ex-servicemen is increasing and now they have announced that they will boycott any government program from the future, it does not include army programs
 modi sarkaar kii ore se ek baar nahin kai baar bharosa diya gaya ki sarkaar van rank van pension ke vaayade se peeche nahin hategi
 But the ex-servicemen sitting on the dharna say that till the government does not announce any deadline regarding this, their fast will go on
 har saal sena se kareeb 50 se 60 hajaar jawan ritair ho jate hai
 There are around 25 lakh ex-servicemen in the country
 purv sainikon ko van rank van pension mili- is baat kaa virodh shaayad hi koi kare lekin ab paramiletry forcej ke jawan bhi sarkaar se maang kar rahe hai ki unke saath sautela vyavhaar kab tak chalata rahegaa
 It is also necessary to make it clear here that the people of Paramilitary Forces are also not opposing the One Rank One Pension of ex-servicemen, but they believe that there should be proper rights
 lekin unki shikaayat yah he ki ek bhedbhaav unke saath bhi hota he
 Be it Naxalites or terrorists - be it border or inside forests, paramilitary forces fight in the same way as the army men
 lekin paramiletry forcej ke jawan suvidhaon main peeche rah jate hai
 For example, if the ITBP personnel guard the border with the army personnel at 18,000 feet, the BSF is standing on the outskirts even in the hot summer desert
 itnaa hi nahin kashmir main aatankiyon or chhatisgarh va madhya pradesh jaise rajyon main naksaliyon se apni jaan kii parvaah na kar logon kii hifaazat karti he
 Despite this, when paramilitary forces forces are recruited, they get only 18 to 20 thousand salary, while army personnel start from 23 to 24 thousand only
 sena main 15 saal kii naukari ke baad pension or paramiletry forcej ke jawan ko 20 saal kii naukari ke baad hi pension kaa sahaara miltaa he
 This difference is clearly visible in the salary of the officers of Army and Paramilitary Forces
 tippaniyan Yes, most army personnel retire at the age of 35 to 37 while paramilitary forces personnel work for around 57 years
 yahi nahin sena se ritair javaanon ko na sirf purv sainik kaa darja miltaa he balki duusari jagah naukari ke saath kai suvidhaayen bhi milti hai
 Every year, about 20 to 25 thousand paramilitary forces retire, but more than half of the people voluntarily leave the force after 20 years of service
 vahiin desh bhar main kareeb 10 lakh paramiletry se ritaller hue jawan hai
 The Paramilitary Forces have also submitted a memorandum to the Seventh Central Pay Commission for their just demands
 inkaa kahana he ki jab sena or inke kaam karne ke halaat ek hai to inhen bhi barabari kaa darja milanaa chahie
 Actually, this whole case points to a strange irony
 jo log desh ke paharedaar hai, ve apane adhikaar ke liye barason se ek vaazib maang ke liye andolan kar rahe hai
 They are getting only assurances from the leaders
 yahi nahin, jane-anjaane hamaari vyavastha ne desh ke liye ladane waalon ko bhi baant diya he- kuch viypi paharedaar hai, kuch kam viypi paharedaar hai
 Like the one who dies on the outskirts, he is a much larger martyr and the one who is killed in a Naxalite attack in Chhattisgarh is a minor martyr

 Not once, many times the Modi government was assured that the government will not back down on the promise of One Rank One Pension
 lekin dharne par baithe purv sainikon kaa kahana he ki jab tak sarkaar isko lekar kisi dedline kaa elaan nahin karti he, unka anshan chalata rahegaa
 Every year about 50 to 60 thousand soldiers retire from the army
 deshbhar main purv sainikon kii taadaad kareeb 25 lakh he
 Ex-servicemen get One Rank One Pension - Hardly anyone should protest against this, but now the soldiers of Paramilitary Forces are also demanding from the government that how long the step-motherly treatment will continue
 yahaan par ye bhi saaf kar dena jaruri he ki paramiletry forcej ke log bhi purv sainikon ke van rank van pension kaa virodh nahin kar rahe balki unka maananaa he ki vaazib haq to milanaa hi chahie
 But their complaint is that a discrimination also happens to them
 naksalwadi hon yaa aatankwaadi- sarhad ho yaa andar ke jangal, ardhsainik bal thik usee tarah ladate hai jaise sena ke log
 But paramilitary forces personnel are left behind in the facilities
 misaal ke taur par agar itibipi ke jawan 18 hajaar foot par sena ke javaanon ke saath sarhad kii rakhwali karte hai to garmiyon main tapate registan main bhi biguef sarhad par dati rahati he
 Not only this, terrorists in Kashmir and Naxalites in states like Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh protect people by not caring about their lives
 baavjood iske jab paramiletry forcej ke jawan bhartee hote hai to unhen maatr 18 se 20 hajaar hi selary milti he jabaki sena ke jawan kii shuruyaat hi 23 se 24 hajaar se hoti he
 After 15 years of service in the army, pension and paramilitary forces personnel get pension only after 20 years of service
 ye fark sena or paramiletry forcej ke afasaron kii selary main saaf najar aata he
 The comments haa, sena ke zyaadaatar jawan 35 se 37 saal kii umr main ritair ho jate hai jabaki paramiletry forcej ke jawan kareeb 57 saal tak naukari karte hai
 Not only this, retired soldiers from the army not only get the status of ex-servicemen but also get many facilities along with jobs in other places
 har saal kareeb 20 se 25 hajaar paramiletry forcej ke jawan ritair ho jate hai lekin aadhe se zyada log 20 saal kii sarvice hone ke baad svaichhik taur par force ko chhod dete hai
 At the same time, there are about 10 lakh paramilitary soldiers retired across the country
 apni vaazib maang ke liye paramiletry forcej ne saatven kendriya vetan ayog ko gyaapan bhi diya he
 They say that when the army and their working conditions are same, then they should also get equal status

 jaise jo sarhad par marataa he, vah zyaada bada shahid he or jo chhattisgarh main naksali hamale main maaraa jaataa he, vah maamuli shahid he
 Whereas the truth is that both of their jobs, both of their lives, and their martyrdom should get exactly the same status - which they are not achieving

 ' bhrashtachar ke khilaaf muhim main jute anna hajaare dilli kii tihaad jail main hi jame hue hai
 Anna Hazare says that he will not go out of jail unless he is allowed unconditional fast
 haalanki der raat tak anna hajaare or unki team ko manaane kii koshishen jari raheen, lekin anna anshan ko lekar koi shart maanane ko taiyaar nahin hai
 According to sources, Delhi Police had agreed to allow Anna Hazare to Ramlila Maidan for the fast, but only for seven days, but Anna Hazare is not ready at this time
 is bich, tihaad jail ke baahar din bhar or der raat tak janata kaa sailaab umada rahaa
 People kept raising slogans in support of Anna Hazare with tricolor and banners in their hands and demanded eradication of corruption and strong Lokpal bill from the country
 anna hajaare ke samarthak buudhvaar ko shaam chaar baje se dilli ke india get par jamaa hone shuru ho gaye
 Team Anna member Prashant Bhushan had announced to the people to gather here in support of the Jan Lokpal bill
 shaam chaar baje se yahaan juty bheed der raat tak india get par hi tiki hui thi
 a candle and torch procession was taken out here at night
 logon ne india get se jantar-mantar or waapas india get tak virodh march kiya
 People of all sections participated in this rally
 anna kii aanch puure desh main mahasoos kii ja rahi he
 In all the cities of Delhi, Bangalore, Guwahati, Chandigarh, Patna, Bhopal, the movement in favor of Anna continued
 kahin mashaal liye log the, kahin vakil, kahi autowale, to kahin mil majdoor
 Thousands of people became part of the rally at Delhi's India Gate
 anna ke badhate jan samarthan ne din bhar sarkaar par dabaav banaae rakhaa
 Once the government agreed to a seven-day hunger strike, Team Anna refused to accept any deadline
 ramlila maidan kii safai shuru kar di gai
 However, the government has accepted all the conditions of Anna
 wo bhi jo anna ne nahin rakhi thi
 She agreed to give Ramlila grounds to Anna instead of JP Park
 na logon kii taadaad par pabandi rahi, na gadiyon kii taadaad par shart chali
 But the matter got stuck on the fast
 darasal sarkaar buree tarah funs gai he
 On one side, the main roads across the country are lying with the agitators, on the other hand it is facing an attack in Parliament
 sansad main pradhanmantri ne bayaan diya, to vipaksh ne unki jamkar khabar lee
 However, the government has succumbed and now Team Anna is preparing for a hunger strike at Delhi's Ramlila Maidan
 lekin isse sarkaar kii chunauti khatm nahin shuru hoti he
 Now the question is, what will the government do? She cannot withdraw the Lokpal Bill introduced in Parliament and replace it with the Jan Lokpal Bill
 vah zyada se zyada ye koshish kar sakati he ki baaki raajnneetik dalon ko apane saath jode or samajhaae ki anna kii maang sansadeey paramparaon ke khilaaf he
 The truth is that in the intervening times, it seemed almost a consensus among the government and the opposition that Anna could not be allowed to appear bigger than Parliament, but after the personal attacks of Congress against Anna and then his arrest, the government Isolated
 ab use nae sire se team anna ko bhi samajhaana hoga or vipaksh ko bhi sadhana hoga taaki anna anshan choden or sansad lokapal bill main kuch nae suzav jode
 But NDTV has come to know that in fact the government was under so much pressure over Anna's fast that it could not believe even his agencies
 sutron se mili jaankaree ke mutabik ibi kii report thi ki anna ko anshan kii ijaajat na dena zyada nuksaandeh hoga
 They will get much bigger support
 police ne bhi kaha tha ki kuch din ke liye anna ko anshan karne dene main koi harj nahin
 When his health worsens, he will be picked up
 lekin sarkaar ne donon reporton ko nazarandaaj kar diya
 Anna Hazare is currently in Tihar Jail
 vah jail se nikalne ke liye taiyaar nahin hai
 After exiting, talks are going on about where they will go on hunger strike
 team anna kii ek sadsy kiran bedi kaa kahana he ki ramlila maidan ko lekar prashasan se baatcheet chal rahi he
 But there is still a difference of opinion between the police and Anna Hazare over the duration of the fast
 kiran bedi kaa kahana he ki unhone 30 din kii ijaajat maangi he, jabaki afasar kam din kii parmishan dena chaahate hai
 Special Commissioner (law and Order) of Delhi Police Dharmendra Kumar and Joint CP New Delhi Range Sudhir Yadav continued to explain Anna's team for a long time
 lekin jab baat nahin bani, to ve baahar chale aae
 Meanwhile, the cleaning work has started in Ramlila Maidan
 anna hajaare ke saamne tarah−tarah kii sharten rakhane vaali sarkaar ke saamne tihaad se nikalne ke liye anna hajaare apni sharten rakhte rahe
 Meanwhile, the news is that the jail officials are upset with Anna's insistence on staying in jail
 unka kahana he ki ve aakhir kis kanoon ke tahat anna ko jail main rakhen
 Anna has been on hunger strike since Tuesday, he is drinking only water
 unke saath 4 or log anshan kar rahe hai, lekin tihaad jail main unke hi saath bheje gaye arvind kejariwal khaanaa kha rahe hai
 Sri Sri Ravi Shankar and Baba Ramdev went to Tihar Jail to meet them
 isse pehle, anna ne rihaai ke baad bhi mangalvaar kii raat jail main hi kaati or vah jid par ade rahe ki unki rihaai bina kisi shart kii jaae
 Late in the night, Anna was given a room to rest in the Tihar Administrative Block and top police officials were busy persuading him and his team
 udhar, india get se jantar-mantar tak raily nikalne ke baad hajaare ke samarthakon ko sambodhit karte hue swami agnivesh ne kaha ki hamane police se kaha he ki agar vah jaiprakash narayan park par anshan kii anumati detii he, to pradarshnakariyon kii sambhavit sankhya ke lihaaj se vah sthaan chota padegaa
 Therefore, we have asked to allow hunger strike at Ramlila Maidan
 agnivesh ne kaha ki puri sambhaavna he ki ramlila maidan par baithkar hi hajaare anshan karenge
 The police have initially offered to allow a seven-day fast, but we want a month's permission
 sutron ne kaha ki dilli police ke nae prastaav main anshan sthal par park hone vaale vaahanon kii sankhya simit rakhane or kisi sarkari chikitsak dwaara hi anshankariyon kaa chikitsakeey pareekshan karne kii shart ko hataa liya gaya he
 Now, along with the government doctor, any private doctor of Hazare side will also be allowed to test the fast
 sutron ke mutabik, police virodh pradarshan ko saat din kii avadhi baad bhi jari rakhane kii ijaajat de sakati he
 He said that there would be no restriction on limiting the number of protesters and that the protesters would be allowed to gather there as per the capacity of Ramlila Maidan

 2ji spectrum aavanton main kathith aniyamitata kii jaanch kar rahi sansad kii lok lekha samiti ne ratan tata auranira radiyaase poochtacha kii
 Committee chairman Murali Manohar Joshi said that while the top industrialist admitted to having his voice in the taped phone, the corporate lobbyist's stance on questions was evasive
 nira se kareeb do ghante or tata se teen ghante lambii poochtacha ke baad joshi ne samvaadadaataaon ko bataaya ki vaishnavi corporate communications kii adhyaksh nira adhiktar sawaalon ke jawaab dene main hichak rahi thim, jabaki udyog samooh tata sans ke adhyaksh ratan tata ne sabhi sawaalon ke jawaab khulkar diye or sweekaar kiya ki jin tepon kii baat ho rahi he, unamem aawaaj unheen kii he
 Joshi said that when Neera was asked whether the voice in the tapped phone was her voice, her answers were such that 'it is difficult for me to say in which context the conversation took place', 'I don't i know 'and' i don't remember
 ’ piesi adhyaksh ne kaha ki haalanki, nira ne sweekaar kiya ki vah 2ji spectrum aavanton ghotaale kii sibiai jaanch ke maamle main gavaah hai or jaanch agency ne unhen kuch tepe bhi sunaaye the
 Joshi said, 'we have asked Neera Radia to provide a list of tapes which were narrated to him by the CBI
 in tepon ke vivaranon par gaur karne ke baad hi samiti yah faisla karegi ki kya nira radia ko dobaaraa bulaane kii jarurat he
 'neera was questioned for two hours in the morning session in this meeting focused on the allocation of 2G spectrum in the presence of 12 PAC members
 unhen 11 baje kaa samay diya gaya tha lekin sadasyon ke bich aapasi charchaa ke kaaran vaishnavi corporate communications kii pramukh se dopaher 12 baje se poochtacha shuru hui jo do ghante chali
 Meanwhile, the questioning began with the chairman of Tata Sons at 3 pm which lasted longer than the scheduled time and ended at around 6 pm
 iske chalate joshi dwaara shaam paanch baje bulaaye gayi samvaadadaata sammelan kaa samay aage badhanaa padaa
 Joshi said, 'there was ambiguity and hesitation in Radia's responses
 ’ tata se kiye gayi sawaalon par unhone kaha, ‘tata ne sawaalon ke saaf-saaf or khulkar jawaab diye or sweekaar kiya ki jin tepon kii baat ho rahi he, unamem aawaaj unheen kii he
 When asked about Tata's response to the tape, the PAC chairman said that when Tata did not deny the sound of the tape, further questions were not asked to him
 is sawaal par ki kya sheersh udyogpati ne sweekaar kiya ki unhone tamilnaadu ke mukhyamantri ko patr likhaa tha, joshi ne kaha, ‘tata ne yah baat sweekaar kii he ki jis patr ke bare main media main khabaren aayi hai, vah unheen ne likhaa tha
 'when asked whether Tata believed that the letter he had given the then Telecom Minister A
K
 raja ke bare main likhaa tha, joshi ne kaha, ‘jo jawaab diye gayi hai, unke vivaran piesi kii report main honge
 Information about this cannot be shared with the media
 ’ joshi ne kaha ki tata ne savalat ke baad yah kaha ki unhen piesi ke samaksh aane se pehle kuch ashankaayen thim lekin sawaalon ke jawaab dene ke baad unhone paaya ki samiti kii kaarywahi garimamay dhang se or peshewar tareeke se chali
 On whether PAC is satisfied with Tata's attitude and dissatisfied with Neera's stance, Joshi said, "no one's personal satisfaction or dissatisfaction is within the scope of pac's objectives
" ’ nira radia kii vibhinn netaaon, udyogpatiyon, naukarshahon or patrakaron ke saath baatcheet ke tepe 2ji spectrum aavanton ghotaale kii jaanch kaa ahm hissaa hai
 Vaishnavi Corporate Communications chairperson Neera appeared before the PAC along with her two senior aides Manoj Warrier and Yatish Wahal

 On the question whether the PAC will also call other people whose names are listed in the charge sheet filed by the CBI in this case, Joshi said, "wherever there is misuse of public funds or loss of treasury, people related to such cases Only PAC will ask questions
 kis vyakti ke khilaaf kis aarope main aarope-patr daakhil hua he, yah ekadam alag mudda he
 ' congress netaa digvijay singh ne team anna ke khilaaf hamalaa tej karte hue kaha ki apane bhrashtachar virdohi andolan main aresas se mili kathith samarthan ke baavjood anna hajaare uskaa aabhaar nahin jataa rahe hai
 Singh wrote on micro-blogging site Twitter, that Baba Ramdev is far more honest about rss's support for his campaign
 samaj main nahin aata ki anna inkaar kyon kar rahe hai, kritagn
 Significantly, the Congress General Secretary criticized the spiritual guru Sri Sri Ravi Shankar for releasing a book by BJP President Nitin Gadkari
 vahiin, kuch din pehle unhone kaha tha ki bhaajapa swami agnivesh ke saath vivaad main arvind kejariwal ke samarthan main utar rahi he, jisase unka daawa sahi thahartaa he ki bhaajapa or aresas kejariwal kaa samarthan kar rahe hai
 Singh had earlier warned Ravi Shankar that the RSS and BJP are trying to use him as their Plan c after Plan a (baba Ramdev) and Plan b (anna Hazare)
 india against karpshan ko mili kosh kejariwal ke trust ko kathith taur par hastantarit hone se paidaa hue vivaad ke baad digvijay ne twitor par likhaa tha, bhaajapa kejariwal ke samarthan main utar gai he
 Does this not prove me right? There is a complete nexus between the RSS-BJP and Kejriwal

 Swami Agnivesh criticized Kejriwal on this issue, but later the BJP came to his rescue
 desh bhar main bhagwaan surya ke kai prasiddh mandir he or sabhi kaa apana alag mahatv he
 Dev Sun Temple located in Aurangabad district of Bihar has its own history
 chhath parv ke dauraan is mandir kii khaasiyat or bad jaati he
 The festival is also held here every year on Surya Achala Saptami
 yahaan chhath par suryakund talab kaa bhi vishesh mahatv he
 The Dev Temple and Chhath are said to be said that when the deity was defeated by the Asuras in the Devasur Sangram, Dev Mata Aditi worshiped the sixth Maiya in Devarnya for the attainment of the glorious son
 tab prasann hokar chhathi maiyaa ne unhen sarvagun sampann tejasvi putr hone kaa vardaan diya tha
 After this, Aditi's son Tridev Roop Aditya became God, who gave victory to the gods over the Asuras
 kehete hai ki usee samay se dev sena shashthee devi ke naam par is dham kaa naam dev ho gaya or chhath kaa chalan bhi shuru ho gaya
 The importance of doing Chhath in the Dev Sun Temple has a different significance of doing Chhath in this temple
 kaha jaataa he ki yahaan bhagwaan surya teen swaroopon main virajman hai
 This is the only Sun Temple in the whole country which is not west facing and west facing
 mandir ke garbh grih main bhagwaan surya, brahma, vishnu or mahesh ke rup main virajman hai
 At the main entrance of the sanctum sanctorum, there is a statue of Lord Surya on the left and on the right is a statue sitting in the lap of Lord Shankar
 aisi pratimaa surya ke anya mandiron main dekhne ko nahin milti he
 a grand fair is held here during the Chhath festival
 har saal puure desh se lakhon shraddhalu yahaan chhath karne aate hai
 It is believed that the devotees who worship Lord Surya in this temple with their heart have their wishes fulfilled
 chhath ke dauraan is mandir ke prati logon kii aasthaa or bad jaati he
 According to the validity of the temple, this temple was constructed by Lord Vishwakarma himself in just one night
 is mandir ke baahar paali lipi main likhit abhilekh se pataa chalata ki is mandir kaa nirmaan aathvin-nauveen sadi ke bich hua tha
 Its craftsmanship shows a mixture of all three styles of Nagar, Dravidian and Besar
 mandir kaa shilp urisa ke konark surya mandir se miltaa he
 The Goods and Services Excise Tax (GST) came into force on 1 July, completing one year
 ek saal puraa kar chuki yah vyavastha aam aadmi ke liye kai morchon par raahat lekar ai, lekin isaki vajah se use or kaarobaariyon ko kuch dikkaton kaa saamana bhi karnaa padaa
 Apart from GST, the Modi government has taken many such steps, due to which the burden on the common man's pocket has increased
 GST ko lekar kanfusion:jiesti ne bhale hi kai saamaan ke daam kam karne main madad kii ho, lekin isko lekar aaj bhi aam aadmi ke man main kanfusion he
 During this one year of GST, many such cases were reported where people complained about unethical collection of GST
 logon ne kai aisi shikaayatein kin, jinamein bataaya gaya ki jahaan 5 fisadi jiesti laganaa tha, vahaan 12 fisadi tex vasula ja rahaa he
 Because of this, GST became a little right for the common man, but definitely painful
 bachat karne kaa phayda hua kam:aam aadmi ke liye public provident fund (PPF), neshnal sevings skim (NSC) or sukanya samruddhi yojana samet anya choti bachat kii yojanaayen paise bachaane kaa ek bada jariya hai
 But the central government has also cut the interest rates on these
 pichley saal disambar main modi sarkaar ne choti bachat yojanaon par milane vaali byaaj daron main 20 basis points kii katautee kii he
 These interest rates are notified every quarter
 april-june timahi main bhi inamen koi badlaav nahin kiya gaya he
 Because of this, investing money in these schemes is proving less beneficial for the people
 PF par byaaj dar 5 saal main sabase kam:modi sarkaar ne ek or jhatka provident fund (PF) par milane vaali byaaj dar main katautee kar diya
 For the financial year ended March 31, the EPFO has paid 8 per cent interest on the PF account
 55 fisadi kar diya he
 This is the lowest in the last 5 years
 isse pehle ke saal main yah dar 8
 65 percent
 lebar ministar santosh gangavar ne bataaya tha ki ipiefo ko ye daren ghataani pad rahi hai kyonki date instrument se ritern kam aayaa he
 This decision of the government has affected the pocket of the common man
 tex ke morche par raahat nahin:is saal ke aam bajet main ummid jataai ja rahi thi ki modi sarkaar 5 lakh rupee tak kii aay ko tex chhot ke daayre main laa sakati he
 However, nothing like this happened
 balki sarkaar ne transport alouns or medical alouns hataakar standard didction kii vaapasi kar di
