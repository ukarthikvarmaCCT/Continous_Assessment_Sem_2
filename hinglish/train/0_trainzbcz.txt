 Macron told Malcolm Turnbull, "I would like to thank you and your Delicious wife for this welcome and hospitality
" '' maikron kii lusi ko ‘delicious’ bataane vaali tippanee ko lekar sidney main logon kii bhaunhen tan gai
 Some are calling it a spontaneous comment of the French President, while others are calling it a joke on France's cooking
 yahaan tak ki kuch ne ise maikron kii patni ke bare main raashtrapati donald kii tippanee kii parody bataaya
 Macro thanked Turnbull for his hospitality while concluding the joint press conference during a brief visit to Australia
 unhone kaha- ‘main aapke swaagat ke liye aapkaa shukriya adaa karata hum
 Thank you and your delightful wife for the great welcome
 ’unki is tippanee ke turant baad soshal media par halki phulki pratikriya aane lagi
 Some people also believe that Macron's language may have slipped in the use of English and he may have wanted to say the French word 'delicia' which means 'delightful'

 unhone kaha ki kejariwal ab benakaab ho chuke hai or janata unki asaliyat jaan chuki he
 According to Bhadana, his aim is to make Kejriwal realize that no one should be accused of wrongdoing and no matter how much fine and punishment Kejriwal gets
 iske alaava bhadaana ne ye bhi kaha ki ab vah sabhi chijen khulengi jo kejariwal ne kiya he, jo galat tareeke se kuch logon ko phayda pahunchaaya he, janata ke bich vah baaten bhi khulengi

 17veen loksabhaa ke pehle satr main sadan main do darjan se adhik bill pesh kiye gaye or unamem se zyaadaatar ko sarkaar paas karaane main kaamyaab rahi
 In the last 15 years, it was the best performance of any government in the initial and budget sessions
 lekin saath hi vipaksh kaa ye aarope rahaa ki endie sarkaar bilon ko kisi bhi tarah paas karne ke liye sadan ko baadhya kar rahi he
 After a landslide victory in the general election, the government is taking the pace of functioning in the first session of the 17th Lok Sabha as a victory
 india today kii ore se ekatra kiye gaye data se pataa chalata he ki vastav main shuruaati satr sarkaar ke liye kamyaabi vaala rahaa he
 As of 26 July, the Modi government introduced 30 bills in the Lok Sabha
 inamen se sadan ne 20 bill paas kiye
 As far as both houses are concerned, 14 bills were passed
 2004 ke baad loksabhaa ke pehle yaa bajet satr main sabase zyada bill paas hue hai
 According to data compiled by PRS Legislative, there was no legislative functioning in the first sessions from the 14th Lok Sabha in 2004 to the 16th Lok Sabha in 2014
 2004 main 5 july se 26 agast tak chale bajet satr main keval 6 bill paas karaae ja sake the
 Similarly, in the budget session of the 15th Lok Sabha (2 July to 7 August) in 2009, only 8 bills could be passed
 2014 main 16veen loksabhaa ke bajet satr main 7 july se 14 agast ke bich 12 bill hi paas karaae ja sake
 At the same time, the opposition alleges that the government is throwing bills in a hurry and these are being done without any scrutiny
 yahaan tak ki is mudde par endie sahyogi janata dal united ne bhi sarkaar ko aagaah kiya he
 Congress MP Pradeep Bhattacharya said, "the way the government is presenting the bill in the House and the way they are being passed in a hurry is not in anyone's interest
" jis tarah kii chaanbin un par honi chahie wo hone kii anumati nahin di ja rahi he
 JDU spokesperson KC Tyagi also questioned the way the bills are being introduced
 tyaagi ne kaha, 'chaahe upie ho yaa endie, unki nishpakshta par vipaksh kii ore se sawaal kiya jaataa he
 It is true that every party has a chance to consider the bill
 saansad ke naate meraa vichaar he ki agar kisi bill ko khaasi sankhya main saansad nirdhaarit samaysima main samiti ko bhejnaa chaahate hai to aisa kiya janaa chahie
 The government rejected the allegations of opposition that due to majority in the Lok Sabha, the government is trying to pass the bills in a hurry
 bijepi saansad vinay sahastrabuddhe ne india today tivi se kaha, 'ye kahana sahi nahi he ki bilon ko bulldos kiya ja rahaa he
 We are always ready to send bills to committees if the House wishes, but often there is no qualitative change in the bills being discussed in the House and the bills considered in the Select / Standing Committees
 'jab abhi sansad kii sthaayee samitiyon ko sampark kiya janaa he to bilon kii baariki se jaanch kaa mauka nahin he
 That is why the opposition parties are demanding that the bills be sent to the Select Committee
 vistaarit satr kii vajah se 7 agast tak or bilon ko pesh kiye jane kii puri sambhaavna he

 The Delhi Jan Lokpal Bill will be introduced in the Assembly on 30 November
 up-mukhyamantri manish sisodiya bill ko sadan ke saamne rakhenge
 Till date, Kejriwal government has an exclusive copy of the Jan Lokpal bill, whose draft is to be presented in the coming days
 bill main janalokapal koek taraf to bhrashtachar ke maamalon main umrakaid tak kii sajaa se lekar aise maamalon main jaanch ke liye kai adhikaar die gaye hai
 At the same time, among the four members of the selection committee of Janlokpal, the Chief Minister has been made the member of the Delhi Assembly
 saath hi uparajyapal ko chayan prakriya se baahar kar diya gaya he
 The most important issue of Kejriwal government has been the biggest issue of Kejriwal government
 dilli vidhansabha kaa satr ek hafte sirf isliye badhaayaa gaya, taaki is bill ko vidhansabha se paas karavaaya ja sake
 Under the ambit of the new Jan Lokpal bill, Jan Lokpal will investigate cases related to corruption of all departments working inside the capital, including the central government departments like Delhi Police, DDA and MCD
 janalokapal ko sajaa dene kaa adhikarabhrashtachar ke maamalon main 6 maheene se lekar umrakaid tak kii sajaa dene kaa adhikaar janalokapal ko diya gaya he
 There is also a provision to recover up to five times the amount of economic loss due to corruption
 lekin vivaad is baat par hone kii ashanka he ki lokapal jaanch cameti ke chaar sadasyon main dilli hoicourt ke mukhya nyaayadhish ke alaava baaki teen netaaon ko rakhaa gaya he
 These three include the Chief Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and the Speaker of the Assembly
 uparajyapal chayan prakriya main shaamil nahin honge or chayan cameti ke faisle ko 30 dinon main maanane ke liye bhi baadhya honge
 There is no mention anywhere in the question that Prashant Bhushan raised, how the Jan Lokpal will investigate the Chief Minister or the members of the Cabinet
 isi ko lekar pehle lokapal andolan kii ahm dhuree rahe prashanth bhushan ne sawaal bhi khadey kiye hai
 Delhi Lokpal bill trashes all principles of an Ind Janlokpal that we had drafted: Appt & removal not under govt; Ind Inv agency under Lokpal — Prashant Bhushan (@ pbhushan1) November 27, 2015 If sources are to be believed, Janlokpal will be a committee of three, consisting of two members and one chairman
 adhyaksh supreme court yaa hoicourt ke jaj rahe hone chahie
 The tenure of the Lokpal will be five years and they can be removed with the permission of the Lieutenant Governor on the proposal of two-thirds of the members in the Delhi Legislative Assembly
 janalokapal, jaanch ke liye janalokapal jaanch adhikari niyukt kar paaenge, jinke paas police ke paas maujuud jaanch ke tamaam adhikaar honge
 The verdict cannot be challenged
 Lokpal will also be free to seek the help of any central agency for investigation and investigation agency of any other state or union territory
 bill main ye bhi kaha gaya he ki lokapal ke kisi bhi faisle ko aage kisi anya adaalat main chunauti nahin di ja sakegi
 The Kejriwal government has decided to introduce the Jan Lokpal bill in the Assembly in a hurry
 lekin virdohi sarkaar par nishaanaa saadhane ke liye kamiyaan jarur dhundhenge, jinka jawaab sarkaar ko bill paas karaane se pehle dena to padegaa hi
 No formula has yet been decided on the sharing of Lok Sabha seats between the bjp-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) allies in Bihar
 kendriya mantri or algepi adhyaksh ramvilas paswan or chiraag paswan ne isi mudde par shuukravaar ko kendriya mantri arun jetali ke saath sansad bhawan main mulaakaat kii
 It is believed that Jaitley has finalized the seat sharing formula between BJP, JDU and LJP along with removing the deadlock of NDA
 chiraag paswan ne kaha ki baatcheet jari he, jald hi seat shering tay kar lee jaaegi
 At the same time, Ram Vilas Paswan's brother Pashupati Paras, a minister in the Bihar government, said that the talks were held in a very cordial atmosphere
 seat shering ko lekar jaldi hi ghoshnaa kii jaaegi or aapasi naaraazgi bhi dur ho jaaegi
 According to BJP sources, talks with Ram Vilas Paswan are in the right direction
 seat shering ko lekar koi vivaad nahin he, aapasi sahmati ban gai he
 It is believed that BJP, JDU and Paswan can jointly announce it on Saturday
 bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar shuukravaar ko dilli aa rahe he
 Nitish will meet BJP president Amit Shah and central Arun Jaitley
 mana ja rahaa he ki bihar ke seat shering ko lekar aapasi baat hogi
 Seats will be announced only after this
 sutron kii maane to bihar main bijepi or jediu ko 17-17 siten or algepi ko 6 siten milengi
 Let me tell you that Ram Vilas Paswan had a meeting with Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) President Amit Shah on Thursday
 is dauraan bihar ke bijepi prabharee bhupendra yadav or algepi saansad chiraag paswan bhi maujuud the
 Actually, there has been a churn among NDA for seat sharing in Bihar for the last several days
 algepi ne bijepi netritv ke saamne ye formula rakhaa tha ki bihar main unhen 5 loksabhaa kii siten or ramvilas paswan ke liye assam se rajyasabha kii ek seat bijepi apane khate se de
 Instead of giving Rajya Sabha seat to LJP, it will leave one seat for BJP in Bihar, but BJP was not agreeing to it
 agar algepi formule par bhi sahmati banati hai, to bijepi 18 siton par, jediu 17 siton or algepi 5 siton par chunaav ladegi

 guuruuvaar ko hi supreme court ne varun gandhi ko do hafte ke liye perol par rihaai kaa aadesh sunaaya tha
 Varun Eta released from prison and came to his house
 is dauraan varun ne media se koi baat nahin kii
 It is reported that as soon as Varun's car arrived at 14, Ashok Road in Delhi, flowers were showered as soon as the gate door opened
 varun gandhi media se baatcheet kiye bina hi nikal gaye
 Regardless of the reason for which Varun Gandhi has kept silence, the BJP has once again ruled it wrong to file a case against Varun under the National Security Act
 varun kii rihaai ko lekar guruuvar ko jahaan dilli main raajnneetik bayaanbaji hoti rahi, vahiin eta main hangaamedaar din rahaa
 The Supreme Court order came at about quarter to eleven
 khabar pahunchate hi eta jail ke baahar kaaryakartaaon kii bheed juteni shuru ho gayi
 Maneka Gandhi herself was keeping an eye on all the formalities, who sat in the jail premises for about 4 hours
 shaam 6 bajkar 26 minute par varun eta jail se nikalakar gambhir mudra main samarthakon kaa shukriya adaa karne aage bade
 Varun did not talk to the media here either
 supreme court ne varun gandhi ko 2 hafte ke liye perol par chhodane kaa aadesh diya
 He will have to give affidavit to Etah Jail Superintendent and ordered to fill a personal bond of Rs 50,000
 itnaa hi nahin, varun gandhi ko apni har movement kii jaankaree pilibhit ke dm ko deni hogi
 Significantly, Varun is accused of making inflammatory speech
 is bich varun ne chunaav ayog jawaab bheja ki bhaashan kii sidi main unki awaz nahin he
 On the other hand, the application that Varun gave to end this case was rejected
 jab zamaanat par lagi roak kii miyaad khatm ho gai, to 29 march ko puure laav-lashkar ke saath pahunche pilibhit kii adaalat main sarender karne
 The uproar of his supporters made Varun in trouble
 uttar pradesh sarkaar ne varun par enese laga diya
 The NSA meant Varun's release for 2 years was difficult
 varun ne supreme court se guhaar lagaai, jahaan court ne varun ke saamne ye shart rakhi ki ve jubaan par lagaam rakhane kaa shapath patr denge
 Probably this is why he did not open his face to the media or he would face the media only after getting instructions from the party
 gujarat main satta kii jameen talash rahi aam aadmi party ne pradhanmantri narendra modi ke janmdin par siyasat karne kaa koi mauka nahin choda he
 AAP leader Ashutosh has accused BJP that Dalits are being tortured in Gujarat and Dalit leaders were fed jail air for not disrupting the birthday celebrations of King Narendra Modi

 Ashutosh, who is handling the responsibility of Gujarat, further said that 'amit Shah had to face the anger of the Kopatidars and gave a speech from behind the cage
 bijepi ke gujarat ke andar gine chune din rah gaye hai

 zyaadaatar kaamyaab logon main ek baat kaaman hoti he ki sabhi log bahut kam sote hai
 There is a huge difference between their working hours and sleeping hours
 kaamyaab log itnaa kam kyon sote hai? is baat kaa jawaab khojna ab mushkil nahin rahaa
 We have extracted diamonds from the treasury of past and present, which have very short sleep hours, but their work is so large that it is difficult to touch their height
 Last Mauryan Emperor Ashoka 41 / 2 hours Ashram before sleeping, eating and then reading something
 They used to go to sleep with the sweet melody of music
 subah jaagane par ve rajkaaj se jude maamalon par vichaar-vimarsh karte or jasuson ko kaam dekar ravaanaa karte
 Before sunset, he used to meet priests, vaidyas, chief cooks and astrologers

 Emperor Jahangir once said of his father: 'he uses every moment of his time very carefully

 Shahrukh is known as 3-4 Ghantesharukh Nishachar

 In Bihar, Jeetan Ram Manjhi is now openly appealing to the mlas that if they want to become ministers, then come with us, that is, openly appeals to the party
 bihar main aisa kam hi dekhne ko miltaa he
 The mlas of Bihar are silver
 unke donon haath main laddu hai, kyonki nitish or maanjhi donon camp se unke paas mantri pad kaa ofer he
 But the biggest question is why BJP is pouring ghee in this fire? Does the BJP not know that to add their numbers, despite that the majority figure is not being completed
 bijepi ko lagata he ki maanjhi 30 se adhik vidhayakon ko tod lenge, to baat ban sakati he
 There are a total of 38 such seats in Bihar, which are reserved for Dalits
 yadi saare dalit vidhayak or kuch aise vidhayak, jinhen lagata he ki nitish kumaar unhen tikat nahin denge, saath aa jaaen, to maanjhi kii naiya paar laga sakate hai
 At present, JDU has 19, BJP has 18 and RJD has one Dalit MLA, i
e
 even if all the jdu's Dalit mlas go with Manjhi, Manjhi needs the support of 15 non-dalit mlas
 bijepi se maanjhi kii nazdikiyaan 1991 se he
 Manjhi Gaya Lok Sabha by-election in 1991 was contested on Congress ticket
 us vakt bijepi ke kaaryakartaaon ne maanjhi ko samarthan diya tha or bijepi kaa ummidavaar haar gaya tha
 Not only this, Manjhi has donated her eldest son to the Sangh Parivar
 ye sab baaten bihar ke log jaanate hai
 When Manjhi met the Prime Minister as the Chief Minister in Delhi, he said, "I have become the Chief Minister only because of you"
 is prishthbhumi main maanjhi kaa bijepi ke daaman main baithna koi tajjub kii baat nahin he
 The BJP does not want Nitish Kumar to sit in the Chief Minister's chair under any circumstances, because if Nitish did a good job and handled the situation, there could be a lot of problems for the BJP
 dilli vidhansabha chunaav haarane ke baad bijepi kii sari takat bihar main hi lagane vaali he
 Now a lot will depend on the speaker during the confidence vote on Friday, because the speaker has given JDU the status of an opposition party, ie Manjhi's Naiya crosses the BJP or Manjhi dips his Naiya himself

 lekin 4 or 5 agast kii darmyaani raat ko marcelo ke dimaag main jane kya fitur savaar hua ki usne ek-ek kar apane pita ke sarvice revolver se apane mata or pita donon ko goli maar di
 After this, he also shot dead two of his nuns from the Point Blanc range
 lekin raat to kya, agle din subah bhi kisi ko uski is karatuut kaa ahsaas nahin hua, kyonki chaar-chaar logon kii jaan lene ke baad agle din subah wo rose kii tarah bade aaraam se apane ghar se niklaa or skool chalaa gaya
 There was neither a wrinkle on his face nor any fear of being caught, but Marcello returned home from school on August 5 after disposing of all classes as usual
 lekin yahaan ek or badi vaardaat uskaa intazaar kar rahi thi, kyonki chaar-chaar qatl ke baad ab is ghar main paanchavin goli chalane vaali thi
 This time, this shot was fired on Marcelo himself
 wo dher ho chukaa tha
 After all, what was the truth of this story of Marcelo? Who killed Marcelo, who killed four people? Innocent Marcelo had a head on his head that made him the youngest serial killer
 lekin apane hi haathon apane maa-baap kii jaan lene ke baad wo khud ko maaf nahin kar sakaa or tab usne aakiri goli khud apane hi sir par maar lee
 In the mind of the 13-year-old schoolboy Marcelo who was riding the Fitoor that night, it is still an enigma to the policemen, because on the intervening night of August 4 and 5, the next day after killing four people, including his own parents Marcello also killed himself when he returned from school
 saao-pawalo police ko jab ilaake ke ek parivaar main mache is qatleam kaa pataa chalaa, to usne sachai pataa karne ke liye puri taaqat jhonk di
 In fact, the police had previously suspected that a gang had entered the house and killed the entire family of Marcello
 Because anyway, Marcelo's parents, both of them were in the police, and their miscreants could cause old enmity
 lekin police ne jab uske ghar or aasapaas ke ilaake kaa muyna kiya, to puri kahani saafe ho gai
 First, there were no traces of forced entry into Marcello's house, nor was any such picture captured in the CCTV camera outside the house, while in the middle of the night someone quietly entered the house and killed four people
 Was not possible vaise bhi agar koi kaatil baahar se hi aayaa hota, to wo marcelo ko kyon baksh detaa, jabaki vaardaat kii agali subah marcelo apane ghar se baahar niklaa tha
 On the other hand, the police were not only seen in the CCTV cameras installed outside Marcello's house, Marcelo exited the house, but it was clear that he was also attending his class at school
 alabatta marcelo ke maasoom doston ne uske bare main jo khulaasa kiya, use jaan kar police waalon ke kaan zarur khadey ho gaye
 Marcelo's closest friend told the police that Marcelo often aspired to grow up to become a hitman, a supari killer
 usne is dost se ek baar yahaan tak kaha tha ki wo sabase pehle apane hi maa-baap ko goli se udayega or phir ghar se bhagkar jurm kii duniya main shaamil ho jayega
 The statement of this child proved to be an important evidence for the police
 lekin paanch-paanch mauton ke is maamle kii tafteesh main abhi kai or aisi chaunkaanewaali baton kaa pataa chalaa, jisane maasoom marcelo ke hi apane maa-baap ke qaatil hone kii baat se shaq kii sari gunjaaish khatm kar di
 Police found that Marcelo had updated a status on his Facebook on December 21, which matched his actions
 marcelo ne 31 november 1974 ke america ke kukhyat ametivile murder cese kii ek charchit tasviir aplod kii thi
 This picture, known worldwide as the Amateville Ghost Boy, claims to have seen the face of a child who died in the Amateville Massacre two years ago
 ametivile narsanhaar main ek hi parivaar ke chah logon kaa qatl usee parivaar ke ek bete ne kar diya tha, jo ab bhi jail main he
 Now the way Marcello has committed suicide by wiping out his entire family, it is also very similar to Amateville's incident
 zaahir he, supaari killer banane ke fitur ne hi marcelo ko pehle to puure parivaar kaa qaatil banaaya or phir hataasha main usne khud bhi apni jaan de di

 The matter of the proposal of marriage of former Deputy Chief Minister of Bihar Tejashwi Yadav is now taking political color
 path nirmaan mantri nandakishor yadav ne vidhansabha main kaha ki path nirmaan mantri rahete tejasvi yadav ko vibhageeya watsap number par shaadi kaa koi prastaav nahin aayaa tha

 He said that with the aim of creating image of Tejashwi on behalf of RJD by resorting to lies in October 2016, it was said that 40,000 marriage proposals were received for him on these phone numbers
 unhone kaha ki vibhaag se jaankaree lene par yah pataa chalaa ki unhen aisa ek bhi prastaav praapt nahin mila tha

 Rajiv Gandhi was made Prime Minister after the assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in the year 1984
 rajeev gandhi ke kaarykaal ko kai ahm faislon ke liye yaad kiya jaataa he
 One of the most important decisions among them was to give the right to vote to the youth of 18 years
 20 disambar, 1988 ko matdaan kii umr 21 se ghataakar 18 saal karne ke liye sansad main kanoon ko manjuuri di gai thi
 That is why the 20th day of the last month of the year is considered special for the youth
 20 disambar ko yun to desh or duniya main kai aisi badi ghatnaayen huin jo itihaas ke pannon main darj ho gayi, lekin bharat ke lihaaj se yuvaaon ke liye yah din behad khaas rahaa
 In 1988, through the 62nd Constitutional Amendment, Parliament approved a bill on December 20 to reduce the voting age from 21 to 18 years
 pehle matadaata ke registrikaran ke liye aayu 21 saal thi
 The 61st Amendment Act of 1988, with the Act 21 of 1989 amending the Representation of the People Act, 1950, reduced the minimum age of voter registration to 18 years by the Constitution
 ise 28 march, 1989 se lagu kiya gaya he
 Increased youth participation
 Rajiv Gandhi's decision to reduce the voting age limit from 21 to 18 years in 1989 increased to 5 crore youth voters
 is faisle kaa virodh bhi hua
 But Rajiv was convinced that youth power is necessary for nation building
 haalanki isse chunaav ke nateezon par koi buniyadi fark nahin padataa
 It is said that Rajiv Gandhi reduced the age of the voter and thought that the voters would give opportunities to the young leader, but this did not happen
 rajeev gandhi ko satta se haath dhonaa padaa
 It is not that young and old people vote for different parties
 haalanki kuch bujurg puraani partiyon ko zyada tarjeeh dete hai
 But it is true that this increased the interest of the youth in parliamentary politics and helped to make the country more inclusive
 2019 main ahm honge yuva voters2011 kii janaganana ke mutabik har varsh kareeb 2 karod yuva 18 varsh kii umr ko paar kar rahe hai
 In such a situation, this young voter is very important for every political party
 siyaasi dalon ko in yuvaaon ko nazarandaaj karnaa sambhav nahin he
 During the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, there will be around 10 crore voters who will vote for the first time
 chunaav ayog ke aankade bataate hai ki 18-20 varsh kii aayu ke matadaataaon ko badi sankhya main pehle hi register kiya ja chukaa he
 This number is about 1 as of 10 February 2018
 38 karod he
 Let us know that in the 2014 general election, there were 81
5 million voters

 isse teen hafton se chalaa aa rahaa gatirodh khatm ho saktaa he
 NC acting president Omar Abdullah tweeted, 'NC has written a letter to Governor Vohra Saheb reiterating his offer to support the PDP and asked them to call us before taking any decision regarding the assembly
 'party ne ek bayaan main kaha he ki abdulla ne vohara se maujuuda vidhansabha ke bhavishya ke bare main or sarkaar gathan main isaki vyavhaaryata ke bare main koi aakhri faisla karne se pehle party netritv se paraamarsh karne kaa anurodh kiya he
 Jammu Provincial President Devendra Singh Rana handed over the letter to Vohra this afternoon
 ensi kor group kii srinagar main kal hui baithak ke baad yah faisla liya gaya
 The letter said, however, the political impasse arising in the state due to the PDP not coming to any decision, the imposition of Governor's rule and the state assembly in suspended state, despite the people of Jammu and Kashmir taking an active part in the election process

 87 siton vaali rajya vidhansabha main pidipi 28 siton ke saath sabase bade dal ke rup main ubhari jabaki bijepi ko 25, ensi ko 15 or congress ko 12 siten mili
 Negotiations between PDP and BJP went on, but no agreement could be reached even three weeks after the election results, which led to the imposition of Governor's rule in the state
 isse pehle aaj din main umr ne kaha ki haalia vidhansabha chunaav ke liye kashmir se party ke sabhi ummidavaaron ne sarkaar gathan ko lekar bijepi se haath nahin milaane ke party ke ruukh se sahmati jataai he
 Now your dream of putting a pillow of notes can come true
 ahmedabad ke neshnal institute of dizin (NID) ke chaatro ne apni creativity se 500 or 1000 ke noton ke kabad se ghar main istemaal hone vaali kai anuthi chijen banaai hai
 After PM Modi suddenly closed 500 and 1000 notes, many people got such old notes deposited in banks and from there these notes reached the Reserve Bank
 bataaya jaataa he ki 500 or 1000 rupee ke kareeb 14 lakh karod mulya ke note bainkon ke jariye rigerv bank ke paas pahunche hai
 After demonetisation, this question was in everyone's mind, what will happen to these notes now? The RBI has now sought help from the NID of Ahmedabad for the use of their junk after destroying these old notes
 darasal enaidi ke chaatr apni creativity ke liye jane jate hai
 The scraps of 500 and 1000 notes that have come to these students are in fine pieces

 kisi ne to isse kushan pilo (takiya) hi bana diya he
 Every student is making different things according to his idea and planning
 'west se best' kaise banaaya jaae yah koi in chaatro se siikhe
 
 
 Students say that these notes are of no use after demonetisation, so we are trying to give them the value that increases their value
 enaidi caprofessor praveen singh solanki kaa kahana he ki is scrap ke istemaal ke jariye studentpradhanmantri ke svachh bharatbhiyaan ko bhi apana samarthan de rahe hai, kyonki itani badi taadaad main jo note radd hue hai, unase ghar main istemaal hone vaali chijen ban raheen hai
 The interesting thing is that these notes are prepared from such material that neither dissolves quickly in the water nor leaves its color
 aise main inase lambey vakt tak chalane vaali chijen aasaani se banaai ja sakati hai
 NID is also going to organize a competition for these scrap notes, so that students can find new ways to use them

 MLA from Greater Kailash, Delhi, Saurabh Bhardwaj is blaming the MCD while waving paper in the air that despite giving the MLA fund, the MCD has not worked in many areas for the last one and a half years
 jaise parkon main open gym, jhule, sadak bananaa, dark spot pe lite lagavaana
 According to Saurabh, there are 2 ways to use MLA funds and one of the two methods is adopted as per the requirement
 saurabh ne kaha ki vidhayak kshetra main vikaas kaary ke liye dilli sarkaar apane vibhaagon se kahe, jisamen emsidi se enosi(no objection certificate) lenaa hota he yaa phir ilaake main vikaas kaary ke liye vidhayak fund sidhe emsidi ko de diya jaae
 MCD commissioner did not provide information
 Aam Aadmi Party claims that when MCD did not work despite taking funds, Deputy CM Manish Sisodia called a meeting of all the commissioners of MCD but the commissioner refused to give any information
 iske baad vidhayak ne jaankaree vidhansabha sadan main rakhi or maamle ko vidhansabha kii Question & Reference cameti ko saunp diya gaya
 If the MLA is to be believed, then all the mayors of MCD kept the wrong information about non-work and fund use in front of the House
 aam aadmi party kaa aarope he ki emsidi ne ek aisa prastaav paas kiya jisamen vidhayak fund se kaam na hone dene or enosi na dene kii baat likhi he
 Aam Aadmi Party MLA from Jangjpura, Praveen Kumar alleged that the MCD does not get a response even after writing several letters
 unke vidhansabha kshetra ke bhogal ilaake main 5 jagah sadak banani thi lekin emsidi se enosi na milane kii vajah se 1 karod kaa kaam ruk gaya or sara fund vidhayak fund main vaapis bhej diya gaya
 According to Praveen, the reason for not getting NOC is the collusion of Congress and BJP councilors
 filhal sabhi vidhayak apane ilaake kii RWA ko chitthee likhakar emsidi ke galat ravaiye kii jaankaree denge kii aakhir unke ilaake main sadak, naalee na banane kii vajah kya he
 Apart from this, the Question & Reference Committee of the Legislative Assembly has sent a notice to all the Mayors, Commissioners and Engineers who have done the construction work of the MCD, to give a false report and appear before the Committee

 The Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Jan Aushadhi Project (PMBJP) was launched to provide affordable and quality medicines to the people, but on paper, this scheme which looks very luxurious and welfare seems to be slowly succumbing to the government system
 upie raaj main shuru hui is yojana kii kismat modi raaj main bhi nahin badali or logon ko bhi isse koi raahat nahin mili
 The Prime Minister's Bharatiya Jan Aushadhi Project (PMBJP) aimed to deliver quality medicines to the people at affordable prices, but this Jan Aushadhi Kendra, which struggles with supply, expired medicines, staff, budget shortage and GST on it, has to deliver medicines to the people
 Has yet failed in its objective
 bharat sarkaar ne 2008 main pradhanmantri jan aushadhi yojana sharu kii thi or 2016 main iskaa naam badalakar pradhanmantri bhartiya jan aushadhi pariyojna (piembijapi) kar diya gaya
 Under this, more than 5,000 Jan Aushadhi Kendras were opened across the country, but its condition is a witness to how public welfare policies and systems are ruined or taxed
 is baar to is sambandh main bajet main bhi katautee kar di gai
 Due to lack of information among the people, the drug buyers are not reaching the Jan Aushadhi centers, even if some people reach out to the forgotten people, most of them return empty handed if there is no supply of medicines
 kuchhek store band ho chuke hai to kuchhek bandi ke kagaar par hai
 The owners of these centers, starting as a primary source of livelihood, are disillusioned
 kai centre maalikon ne aapurti kii samasya se nipatane ke liye ab branded davaaiyaan bechni shuru kar di he
 Patients arriving at the Jan Aushadhi Kendra in the hope of getting medicines that are deficient in supply of medicines are disappointed to see that not all prescription medicines are available
 majaburi main unhen branded davaaiyaan leni padati hai
 41-year-old Guddu Pal of Jhansi district has been taking diabetes medicines for the last three years
 unhen har maheene kareeb 900 rupee kharch karne padate hai
 Guddu says, 'when i came to know about this center six months ago, asked the doctor about it
 doctor ne saaf-saaf kuch kehane kii bajaae yah kahkar man main sanshay kaa beej daal diya ki aap chahen to jan aushadhi centre se davaaiyaan le sakate hai lekin asar kitna hoga, isaki guarantee main nahin le saktaa
 When he asked other doctors with courage, he advised him to take medicines from Jan Aushadhi Kendra
 guddu ne davaaiyaan leni shuru kar deen
 If one month of medicine was taken in May, then medicines worth Rs 900 were just Rs 423

 But even after a three-month cycle, he did not receive the three prescription drugs (tendia M, Cybelex M60XR and Rosade-10) simultaneously
 centre maalik ne bataaya ki unke paas do davaaiyaan pichley kuch samay se nahin aa raheen
 Similarly, 63-year-old Sunita Devi of Unnao district has to take one tablet of Taumur atenolol and amlodipine salt daily for high blood pressure

 Branded dominating generics Jai Ram Singh, owner of Jan Aushadhi store in Kalibari, New Ashok Nagar, Delhi, says, "not only in my store, you will find branded medicines in every store in Delhi

 'SP Sharma also questions the incentive received for opening the center,' i opened the store about three years ago, so far it is just Rs 30,000
 incentive hi mujhe mila he
 'actually, the government provides Rs 2,50,000 to help in opening the store, but this assistance is available in the form of a rebate of 15 per cent on every month purchase of Jan Aushadhi, not outright
 espi sharma bataate hai, 'ab tak main 10,00,000 rupee kii davaaiyaan kharid chukaa hum lekin kharid ke mukaable incentive ek-tihaai hi mila

 It is being told that during that time Aurangzeb was the only one who did not follow the standard operating procedure implemented by the army
 14 june kii shaam ko aurangzeb kaa shav pulavama jile ke gusso gaanv main baraamad hua tha
 It was about 30 km from Kalampora village, where they were kidnapped

 But at some distance, the terrorists surrounded the car and kidnapped them
 gaadi ke driver faruk ne bataaya ki sena ke jawan use camp main laae or mughal road tak ke liye lift maangi
 It is about 6 km from their camp
 dur thi, isliye vah manaa nahin kar sakate the
 He told that when we were about 1 km from the camp
 dur the, tab ek maaruti car main teen bandookdhaari log aae or us jawan ko jabardastee lekar chale gaye

 The army has started an investigation to find out where the omissions in Aurangzeb's case are and the necessary changes in sop are also being talked about

 "the principle of Ayurveda is that if you get signs before you get sick, then it should be treated properly
 khaastaur par nai peedi ko welnes or health ke solution die jane chahie
 Therefore drugs have been made available in capsule and tablet form instead of traditional churan-chutney
 "chhaparwaal kaa kahana he ki kuch arsa pehle ayurvedic chikitsa paddati allopathy ke mukaable kaaphi pichad gai thi
 The reason was that people considered Ayurvedic product as churan-chutney and treatment was called quack
 unki company ne product ko aakarshith banane par jor diya
 Now instead of churan-chutney, they introduce Ayurvedic medicines in the form of syrup, capsules, tablets and granules

 "apart from this, he had 250 years of experience of many generations
 aaj unki company 600 prakaar ke ayurvedic product bana rahi he

 dinadayal aushadhi ke product international market main tik saken, iske liye company ne ticues audit karaayaa he
 Chhaparwal claims that the company's products have met the criteria of this audit and Deendayal Pharmaceutical is now ready to become multinational
 ''company ne ve sabhi certificate hasil kiye hai, jinase aushadhiyon ko har bazaar main manyata milti he
 "challenges too no less

 He explains, "as the market share of Indian companies is increasing, due to this, now many multinational companies are getting ready to enter this field
 "aisi companiyon ke market main aane se compitishan baduya tay he, kyonki unki marketing bahut majboot hoti he or ve puunji bahut zyada lagaati hai
 Deendayal Aushadhi Limited is also ready for this

 The workforce is being increased from 170 to 250 in both these sectors

 Apart from this, Ayurvedic product stores will also be opened in metro cities
 dinadayal aushadhi hriday or diabetes kii bimariyon kii dawa banane ke baad ab liver kii hepatitis bi or duusari bimariyon kii aushadhiyon par dhyaan de rahi he

 Chhaparwal explains that "special treatment of diabetes patients is done with the help of Jiwaji University

 bhartiya vayusena dwaara pakistan ke aatanki addon par hamale ke baad netaaon kaa saboot maangane kaa silsilaa chaalu ho gaya he
 In the list of leaders seeking evidence, MP from Patna Sahib and BJP leader Shatrughan Sinha have also joined
 bihari babu ke naam se mashhoor shatrughna sinha ne bhi apni sarkaar ko katghare main khadaa kar pakistan main hue air strike ke saboot maange hai
 How Shatrughan Sinha, who has been continuously attacking his party and government, would remain silent on this occasion, so as soon as he reached Patna, he raised his rebellion and said that different representations of the government on different channels are saying that 300 terrorists were killed
 So someone is saying 500 terrorists were killed
 aisi paristhiti main desh kii janata ke saath-saath puraa vipaksh bhi jaananaa chahta he ki kitne aatanki maare gaye
 He said that the country wants to know the extent to which the strike was carried out with the story of the military's might
 unhone aage kaha ki agar centre sarkaar ye aankada bataa degi to main samajhataa hum ki desh kii janata kii bhi hausala afjai hogi
 If the truth comes out, the government will be applauded
 haalanki unhone yah bhi kaha he ki sena ke parakram par unhen koi shaq nahin he
 The work of the army is praiseworthy and exemplary, but along with it, the people of the country want to know some things, so what is the harm in this? shatrughna sinha yaheen nahin ruke
 He also defended Congress leader Digvijay Singh
 jinhone pulavama ke hamale ko durghatana bataa diya tha
 Reacting to this, Bihari Babu said that i would say that Digvijay Singh is a very mature man
 aisa lag rahaa he wo kahana kuch chaahate the or shabd kuch or nikal gaye
 On the other hand, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has said that there should be no politics regarding air strikes
 nitish kumaar ne kaha ki sena ne pakistan main jaakar jo air strike kii he
 This has increased the respect of the people of the country for the army

 Ironically, during the campaigning for the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party slammed Manmohan Singh's Congress government on economic policies
 prachaar ke dauraan bhartiya janata party ne vikalp ke taur par congress se ulat aarthik niti kii peshkash kii or satta par kabiz hui
 Ironically, this party, formed in 1980, did not have a clear economic policy and now after giving power for almost four years, it can be said that there is a difference between the economic policy of both Bharatiya Janata Party and Congress Party
 Is not
 bhartiya janata party ne congress kii saamaajik or aarthik nitiyon kaa virodh karte hue use kamjor vikaas dar or bhrashtachar ke liye jimmedaar tehraane kaa kaam kiya he
 Where the economic policies of the Congress were to promote the socialist structure in the country, keeping the public sector at the center
 vahiin satta main aane ke baad bhartiya janata party bade aarthik sudhaaron ko kendra main rakhte hue arthvyavastha ko majboot karne kii pahal par aadhaarit rahi
 Hence, the Congress accuses the Bharatiya Janata Party of inconsistent privatization during its tenure
 ab vipaksh vaali bhartiya janata party or satta vaali bhartiya janata party kii aarthik nitiyon kaa aankalan karen to dekhne ko miltaa he ki party kii aarthik niti main bada pherbadal darj hua he
 The policies of the Bharatiya Janata Party sitting in opposition continued to resist the policies of the Congress, and after coming to power, it did not hesitate to follow those policies
 darasal, bhartiya janata party ke andar bhi aarthik nitiyon kii kai dharaaen prachlit he
 Read this: These 10 decisions of the Modi government have increased the challenges of the Yogi government
 At the time of the establishment of the Bharatiya Janata Party in 1980, the party's economic policy was like the previous Jana Sangh where the policies of the National self-service Association and other affiliated organizations were adopted
 is dauraan party ne swadeshi kaa naaraa buland karte hue gharelu utpaadan par jor diya or niryaat main ek sangrakshanvaadi niti kaa paksh liya
 At the same time, the party opposed the industrial policy of the Congress, in which government companies were placed at the center
 lekin 1996 ke chunaavon ke dauraan party ne apana rukh puri tarah badla or sangrakshanvaad kii jagah vaishvikaran par jor dena shuru kar diya
 The party's election manifesto spoke of large foreign investment in primary sectors
 phir 1998 main satta par kabiz hote hi party ne vaishvikaran ke paksh main apni nitiyon ko or pukhta kar liya
 This led to the arrival of a large number of foreign companies in India during the tenure of the first NDA government led by the Bharatiya Janata Party
 khaas baat yah he ki jahaan aresas or anya sambhddha sanghathan (swadeshi jaagran manch) in nitiyon ke virodh main rahe, bhartiya janata party kii sarkaar banane ke baad inkaa virodh shant ho gaya
 After this change in economic policies, the opposition parties and especially the Left parties accused the Bharatiya Janata Party that its policies were set to please the US and the World Bank
 haalanki is daur main aresas ne bhi bhartiya janata party par swadeshi ke mudde se mukarne kaa aarope lagaaya
 During the tenure of the two governments led by the Bharatiya Janata Party from 1998 to 2004, there was large-scale privatization of government companies and deregulation in many areas
 is dauraan party ne videshi companiyon kaa bharat main aane kaa rasta bhi saaf karne kii mahatvapurn pahal kii
 However, these decisions of the Bharatiya Janata Party were made in 1991 keeping the decision of the Congress Party to follow the policies of economic liberalization
 is faisla kaa nateeja bhartiya janata party ko dekhne ko mila or uske kaarykaal ke dauraan jidipi vikaas dar main acchhee raftaar darj hui
 Read this: After the stock market, petrol prices also left the Modi government's support
 Based on this result, the Bharatiya Janata Party kept the Shining India draft before the 2004 Lok Sabha elections
 is masaude ke saath party ne apni niti bhi spasht kii ki mukt vyapaar ke jariye hi samaaj ke sabhi kshetra unnat kar sakenge
 This change in economic policy was not seen only at the national level
 bhartiya janata party shashit pramukh rajyon main bhi is niti par pahal hui or iskaa bhi nateeja rahaa ki party dwaara shashit rajyon main vikaas dar main acchhee badhat dekhne ko mili
 After this, from 2004 to 2014, the Bharatiya Janata Party once again sat in the opposition
 is dauraan ek baar phir party ne congress kii aarthik nitiyon kaa virodh shuru kiya
 When it comes to implementing a tax system in the country, the party completely rejected the Congress draft
 yaa phir congress sarkaar dwaara inakam tex main ijaphe kii pehle ho to inakam tex kii vyavastha ko puri tarah se khatm karne kii daleel di gai
 But when the party returned to power in 2014, the same GST was implemented as the biggest reform
 vahiin beete chaar saal ke kaarykaal ke dauraan inakam tex ko khatm karne kii daleel to dur sarkaar kii kamai badhaane ke liye lagaataar tex daayre ko badhaane kaa kaam kiya gaya
 Therefore, it should be said that there is no difference between the economic policy of Congress and BJP sitting in power, then the government has presented strong arguments in its favor during its tenure
 bharat ke swatantraaa diwas ke maukey par puri duniya se badhaaiyon kaa tantaa laga hua he

 It is said that the wife can tolerate everything, the husband cannot tolerate the infidelity
 or jo shuhar ghar main sautan laane kii taiyaari kar rahaa ho, uski bivi kii haalat samajhi ja sakati he
 Then whether that wife is a socialite or a model? When a model Bauhar of a model wife in Delhi did something similar, then all the modeling of Shouhar was lost in front of Rauvra form of BV
 lekin isse pehle ki ham is pati ke is durgati kii kahani aapakon tafsil se sunaaen, aaie sabase pehle is kisse ke ahm kirdaaron yani donon pati-patni se aapkaa tarurf karaae dete hai
 The name of the person who got beaten up is Arjun S
 Khan whereas the name of the broken girl is Salina Wali
 afagaan mul ke noujvaan arjuna or salina donon hi model hai or ye modelling hi he, jisane donon ko pati-patni kaa darja bhi diya he lekin ab yahi darja arjuna ko baari pad rahaa he
 This relationship is at such a strange point at the moment, the story of its reaching this turn is equally shocking
 salina ke sabar kaa paimaana yun hi nahin chhalkaa
 Arjun had already prepared the reason for this
 ek to shuhar par bewafaai kaa shaq tha, doosraa jab bivi usase milane pahunchi, to usne sidhe apni hi bivi ko baahar kaa rasta dikhaa diya
 What was it then, Biwi also brought the husband outside the house and then the whole world saw what happened
 salina or arjuna kii zindagi pehle aisi nahin thi
 a world full of dazzling modeling, page three parties with celebrities
 kai baar donon ramp par bhi ek-duusare kii baanh thame kadamtal karte rahe lekin ramp se aage bad kar hakiqat kii duniya main ek duusare kii bahen thaamna ab donon ko baari pad rahaa he
 In Ishq, both of them got married, but soon after the wedding Arjun realized that he did not do it right
 salina kii maane to shaadi ke baad usne kariyar kaa vaasta dekar is rishte ko chhipaae rakhane kii salaah di lekin uske dil main kuch or hi chal rahaa tha
 At first, Salina also came into her talks and then kept telling herself single as Arjun said, but soon she came to know that Arjun's reality is something else
 
 
 balki wo sirf salina se hi nahin, balki or bhi kai ladakiyon se behad qareeb he
 Salina was already suspicious, but when she came to know that her husband is living like a bachelor in Dwarka area of delhi by making excuses for the same reasons, her patience was spoiled but when Salina reached here for the first time So he had to face his mouth
 darasal, salina ko ye khabar mili thi ki arjuna uski nigahon se batch kar duusari shaadi karne ja rahaa he lekin jab salina ne usase aamane-saamne baat karne kii koshish ko arjuna us par baari pad gaya
 Salina had to return, but when Salina returned the next time with full preparation
 salina kaa raudra rup dekh kar ab arjuna ke hosh fakhta ho chuke the
 But Salina's anger was on the seventh sky
 pehle to usne cheekh-chilla kar padosiyon ko bulaayaa or phir kisi bhukhi sherni kii tarah arjuna par tut padi
 What was it then, what was the common battle at home, everyone started waving Arjun's hand
 jise jaisaa mauka laga, arjuna ko peet gaya
 However, the quarrel of model Mian Biwi ended only after reaching the police station
 dhigamushti kii khabar milane police maukey par pahunchi or arjuna ko ilaaj ke liye aspataal main bhartee karvaa diya lekin ye ilaaj bas ab doctoron tak mahadood rahata he yaa phir salina kii shikaayat police nae sire se arjuna kaa ilaaj karti he, ye dekhnaa baaki he
