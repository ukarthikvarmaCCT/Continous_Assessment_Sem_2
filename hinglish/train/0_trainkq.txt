 ) jab steve jobs ne yphone pehali baar launch kiya tha to kaha tha, ab aapako ghadi pahanane kii jarurat nahin rahegi
 Because the iphone has a watch
 jobs sahib swarg sidhaar gaye
 His successor, Tim Cook, has just lifted the curtain from the iphone 6 and says that all we need is a clock
 vah ghadi appal kii he
 Technology has become a matter of mere wear, not of use
 or ye nai baat nahin he
 Samsung, LG and Bhatre Chinese counterfeiters started launching new watches in the market two years ago
 ye ghadiyaan mobile phone kii tarah kaam karti hai
 Also tells you your heart rate and blood pressure
 par abhi tak duniya pagalaai nahin thi
 Even if some people bought, they did not look very impressed
 par ab chunki appal ne appal watch banaaya to logon par nayaa bukhaar chaa gaya he
 Suddenly a new need has arisen
 aisa lagata he is ghadi ke bina jindagi adhuri thi
 This watch does all that the iphone does
 par agar aap ye soch rahe hai ki yphone na lekar ye ghadi le lenge to aap galat hai
 This watch works only if you have an iphone
 chunki samay sabase bada dhan he isliye is ghadi main samay dekhne ke liye aapako bahut sara dhan dena padegaa
 The new iphone also serves as a wallet
 basharte aap apane batue ko tilanjali de den
 Or kidney
 gurde kii baat isliye kar rahaa hum ki har nae yphone kii khabar ke baad ye khabaren aati hai ki falaan desh ke falaan shahar main ek aadmi ne yphone kharidne ke liye apane gurde bech die
 Reading these news, we always used to think how daring the world is
 ek phone ke liye gurde kaa sauda karne par utar ai he
 But thought carefully that it is a bargain for profit
 android phone bhale yphone par bees paden par unki aukaat unniis kii hi rahegi
 The matter is simple
 yphone states simbel he
 God gave us two kidneys, while work only works
 agar bhagwaan ko hamen gurde bechney se rokna tha to vah ek hi dete
 Why did the captors come in the midst of Allah’s will
 yphone 6 ke liye gurda bechney ke 6 kaaran ye rahe:1
 The kidneys are few in appearance
 lathpath or lurlure
 If you take it in your hands, then vomiting
 duusari taraf yphone aaha aaha! maasha allaah! metal body, charhara badan or maddham-maddham sugam sangeet kaa ringtone
 2
 koun jaanata he ki apan ke paas do gurde hai yaa ek
 Everyone knows if you have an iphone
 jeb main bhi ho to chehre kaa aatmavishvaas bataata he
 If you do not get caught then do not worry because the owner of the iphone stares out of pocket once every minute
 3
 Kidney work is to clean the blood
 bas ek hi kaam
 From the iphone you can listen to songs, take photos, play candy crushes
 yani multi-tasking kar sakate hai
 With the new iphone you can also pay while shopping
 haalanki gurde se bhi bhugtan hota he par zyaadaatar pratishthan credit card prefr karte hai
 4
 aapke do kidney hai, jaise sabake hoti hai
 Even if you remove one, you have a fully functional kidney and an iphone comes
 5
 Kidney techniques are centuries old
 bhagwaan ne jab banaaya tab ke baad usamen koi apgrade bhi nahin aayaa he
 The iphone was also created by Mr
 Steve Jobs, the God of modern technology and design
 usamen har saal software apgrade bhi hota he
 Even if it is one or two years behind Nexus, it is better than kidney

 Now, if you want to adopt this mantra, then what can be better than khichdi in plain eating
 bhartiya khan-paan main shaakaahaari vyanjanon main ahm sthaan rakhane vaali khichdi in dinon soshal media par chai hui he
 There is also a lot of discussion about Khichdi being introduced as India's superfood
 kya sachmuch khichdi itani sarvagun sampann he ki use super food kahaan ja saktaa he? haridwar sthit patanjali yogapith ke acharya baalkrishna kii maane to sachmuch khichdi main gun kuta- kuta kar bhare hai
 According to Acharya it is a matter of pleasure that Khichdi is going to get his respect soon
 acharya kehete hai ki khichdi sahi myne membharat kapratinidhitiv karti he kyonki yah hamaare desh kii tarah ‘anekta main ekta’ko dikhaati he
 Khichdi is eaten in some form in every state of India, but everywhere its taste varies in its color form and the way of making it
 khichdi kii sabase badi khaasiyat bhi yahi he ki usamen apni pasand ke anusaar se manachaaha badlaav kiya ja saktaa he
 Despite all the changes in the way of making khichdi, both its basic properties and taste remain
 acharya bal krishna ke mutabik ayurveda ke hisaab se bhi khichdi behad uttam aahaar maani gai he
 It is easy to digest
 swasthya thik naa hone par halke khaane ke taur par khichdi ke seven kii hi salaah di jaati he
 When the babies also start eating food, then the slang is put on their mouths
 khichdi ko pakaane main chaaval,chhilake vaali daal,bahut halke masaale or subjiyon kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 It is also very easy to cook
 banane kii isi aasaani ke kaaran ‘khichdi pakaana’ek muhaavarey ke taur par bhi istemaal hota he
 Acharya says that the identity and respect that Khichdi is getting now should have been found long ago

 People do not do anything to get relief from depression
 kuch log tarah-tarah kii dawaaiyon kaa seven karte hai, to kuch log apni puri diet badal dete hai
 But when there is no rest, people come in more trouble than before and thus people get trapped in depression
 lekin ek nai study ke anusaar davaaiyaan khaane se aapkaa depressant thik nahin ho saktaa he
 According to the report published in the Journal of American Medical Association, nutritional supplementation is not effective in curing your depression
 bataa den, is study main euke, netherland, germany or spain ke un logon ko shaamil kiya gaya, jinhen depressant to nahin he lekin hone kii kagaar par hai
 a sample of 1000 people has been taken for this study
 ek saal tak chali is study main kuch logon ko nutrishanal supplement diya gaya
 While some were given placebo and some were given lifestyle coaching
 study ke parinaam vaise to kisi bhi pahalu par zyada sakaaratmak nahin he, phir bhi ye kaha gaya he ki diet main parivartan or bihavioral therapy depressant ko kuch had tak kam karne main sakasham he
 Professor ED Watkin, researcher of this study, says, 'depression has become a very common problem, which is engulfing many people, it is necessary to find a solution
 is study ke baad ham ye to kah sakate hai ki nutrishanal supplement lene se depressant kam nahin hota he
 But changing the diet can reduce depression to some extent
 isaki puri tarah se pushti karne ke liye abhi or study karne kii jarurat he
 After this study, it can be said that if you include fruits, vegetables, fish, lentils and dairy products in your diet, then you will be healthy and the risk of depression will be less
 vahiin agar aap motaape ke shikaar hai to apana vajan kam karnaa shuru kar den, isse aapkaa depressant bhi kam ho jayega

 bihar chhath puja sampann ho gai he lekin is lok parv ke bahaane rajya main bijepi ne kuch hafte pehle dashahra ke vaqt raajnneetik tanaav ko kam karne kii koshish kii he
 All the ministers, especially Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Modi and Minister Nand Kishore Yadav were attentive in the Nitish cabinet
 isliye mukhyamantri ke saath ghat nirikshan ho yaa chhath ke din shaam ke arghya ke dauraan sabhi saath-saath dikhe
 However, according to Bihar BJP leaders, Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, who is now an MP from Patna Sahib and also alone inspected the ghats a day before Kharna
 unhone chhath ke shaam ghoomane ke liye ek jahaaz bhi mangaya tha
 But leaders like Sushil Modi and Nand Kishore Yadav advised him to abstain from it and proposed that he should also accompany the Chief Minister and the Governor
 susheel modi or nand kishor yadav ko is baat kaa dar tha ki ravishankar agar jate to phir bijepi vidhayakon ko bhi unke saath janaa padataa
 Which the media would analyze on its own
 haalanki jahaaz par shanivaar shaam sabhi netaa jab gum rahe the
 This time, seeing the management on the ghats, slogans of 'nitish Kumar Zindabad' were also heard from the ghats
 gauratlab he ki dashahra ke dauraan patna ke gandhi maidan main yojit kaarykram main jab mukhyamantri nitish kumaar bhaag lene pahunche tab BJP ke mantri hon yaa rajyapal yaa vidhayak kisi ko vahaan na dekhakar unako kaafii hairaani hui thi
 Even if they asked the organizers in this regard, they were told that they had agreed and opted out of the event with some excuse at the last minute, after which a lot of questions were raised about the future of the alliance
 lekin baad main bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh or kendriya grih mantri amit shah ne sabhi atakalon par yah kahkar viraam lagaaya ki agle saal bihar vidhansabha chunaav main BJP nitish kumaar ke netritv main hi ladegi
 There are some relationships that start but do not reach the end
 vahiin kuch aise bhi hote hai jo shuru tak nahin ho pate
 Many times it happens that both sides have feelings towards each other equally but still the matter is not made
 par kya aap jaanate hai aakhir kyon kuch relationships aage nahin bad pate hai? haalanki aisa hone kii kai vajahen ho sakati hai lekinap khud aisi kisi paristhiti main fanse hue hai to aapako sochane kii jarurat heki aapke relation main aisa hone kii kya vajah ho sakati he
 Here are some reasons why the relationship is not complete: 1
 ladki kabhi bhi pratikriya nahin detiho saktaa he ki jis ladki ko aap pasand karte hai, wo aapaki padosi yaa phir college-met ho
 You see him from a distance every day and try hard to show your interest
 ladki bhi aapaki baton or harkaton par khush to hoti he lekin khud apni taraf se koi pratikriya nahin detii
 In such a situation, the love story never progresses
 aapke paas bhi itani himmat nahin hoti he ki aap use saamne se jaakar prapoj kar den or ladki khud bhi kabhi pahal nahin karti
 Such relationships end before they move forward
 2
 In a situation of instability, there are many women who are unable to take quick decisions and have a wavering attitude
 aisi mahilaayein asthirataa liye hue hoti hai
 When approached, she talks, smiles and shows her interest, but even then nothing is made
 aisi ladkiyaan faisla lene main kaaphi vakt leti hai or asthir hoti hai3
 There is also a reason to fear, you love you very much but never get enough courage to talk about your house in your context
 aap use har tarah se samajhane kii koshish karte hai lekin aapke lakh prayaason ke baavjood wo aapako koi na koi bahaanaa hi detii he
 Such stories start but end in a few days
 4
 Arrogance is also the reason that sometimes due to the ego, some relationships do not progress
 aap donon hi ek-duusare ko pyaar karte hai lekin intjaar hi karte rah jate hai ki saamne se pehle us shaks ko prapoj karnaa chahie
 In such a situation, both of them are buried in their ego and the love story ends
 yahaan jo baaten ladakiyon ke sandarbh main kahi gai hai wo ladakon ke sandarbh main bhi ho sakati hai
 Sometimes some boys react in their lives to be void, unstable and timid
 aise main ek paksh kii lakh koshishon ke baavjood unki prem kahani shuru hone ke saath hi samaapt bhi ho jaati hai
 What happened in the country, the world, metropolitan sports, economic and Bollywood

 India and the United States are set to begin their most important two-way summit on September 6 when US Secretary of State Mike Poquipayo and Defense Minister Jim Mattis make their first "two Plus to Dialogue" with their Indian counterparts, Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj and Defense Minister Nirmala Sitharaman

 Former Indian Foreign Secretary Kanwal Sibal says, "the 2 + 2 dialogue is taking place at a time when President Trump's policies have created uncertainty in international affairs, America's allies and adversaries, in the comfort zone of both countries as well as India

 Two key agreements with the US are also likely to be launched — one of which is the COMCASA or Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement that will allow India's us-made military platforms to communicate with the US and NATO platforms after the installation of specialized communications devices; The second is the BACA or Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement, which will allow the exchange of such information

 Avoid those 'knowledgeable' men who espouse some permanent beliefs about girls and then get involved in propagating those shagoofs
 ladkiyaan kya sochati hai, kya chaahati hai, kaise hansatii hai, kya khaati-piti hai, sab kaa theka inhen gyaniyon ke jimme he
 Regarding girls, boys and girls themselves take this 'stereotype' in mind and begin to think of it as a line of stone
 premiyon ke premi baba tintin kaa maananaa he ki nae daur main is bagez ko peeche chode jane kii jarurat he
 These 16 misconceptions about girls are 1
 bolti bahut he yaar:agar aapako lagata he ki har ladki bolne vaali hoti he to iskaa ek hi matlab he ki chup rahane vaali yaa santulit maatra main bolne vaali kanyaon se aapkaa paala nahin padaa he
 There are also girls who know when, where and how much they have to speak
 2
 Replay of makeup: Girls are teased even after seeing their moon-like appearance repeatedly
 lekin aisi bhi bahut si ladki hai, jo bina mechap apni maasoom muskaan se kadi dhoop main bhi barish jaisi thandak dene kaa boota rakhti hai
 3
 aao bahan chugali karen:gharon kii balakani se latakate hue yaa phir bich class main akasar ladkiyaan samaajik muddon par charchaa karti hui dekhi jaati hai, jise duniya ne chugali kaa naam diya he
 In such a situation, we should not forget even those girls who keep their sorrows in mind
 4
 Hands tight in politics: After Alia Bhatt's immense success of not being able to name the president, before and even before, girls are considered tight in politics
 lekin aise vakt main ham malala yusafajai kii samaj or sanyukt raashtra main lakhanu ke skool kii yugaratna shrivastav kaa green climet par diya bhaashan bhul jate hai

 shopping, shopping, shopping:tension kam karne se lekar bwoyfriend ke saath ladakiyon kii sabase badi jarurat shopping ko samajha jaataa he
 Shopping bags are attached to their identities, hanging like rattan bags in the hands of girls
 par dil par haath rakhkar ladakon ko ye bhi yaad karnaa hoga ki unke liye sabase pyaari shart, jeens kisi ladki ne hi kharidi hogi
 6
 driving main lup-lup:dhooma filmon se prerana lene vaale log ladakiyon ko driving main behatar nahin maanate hai
 But in such a situation, we forget the space travel of Sunita Williams and Kalpana Chawla
 7
 Time to set up: The entire moon is also seen after 30 days
 lekin ladakiyon ke taiyaar hone main lagane vaale maamuli teen-chaar ghanton ko jaalim duniya sajane main zyada vakt se jodakar dekhati he
 But due to the beauty of those girls, no one adds their friends to their family
 8
 It is important for a girl to be a cook: the way of the man's heart passes through the stomach and if the girl has to do the work to reach the heart, then it is necessary to cook
 agar ladki khaanaa nahin bananaa jaanati he to ise uski bachapan kii galatiyon main shumaar kar liya jaataa he
 But the boys do not think if they know how to make anything apart from Maggie

 Pink means girl: Those who associate pink cheeks with pink dress believe that the favorite color of girls is pink
 hindi filmon or archies gailaree kaa isamen khaasaa yogadan he
 But in pink color, you see your sweetie in a beautiful black dress and also drool
 10
 Weeping is enough: beauty and sentimentality are concerned
 shaayad isiilie zyaadaatar ladakiyon ke bare main kaha jaataa he ki ladkiyaan roti bahut hai
 And if the same crying girl says to break the relationship, then the boys themselves shed tears like Nirupa Roy
 11
 Poor to propose: Boys are responsible for expressing love
 ladakiyon kaa aamtaur par kaha jane vaala katu kathan ki ladkiyaan prapoj kaise kar sakati hai
 One should also pay attention to the fact that once you propose, the girls do the work of running the relationship for a long time and facing persistence like a child
 12
 Golgappa, chatter-patter: The fun of life is in sour and in this way most girls are seen enjoying life with sourness
 ye maanane vaale khud kii jubaan ke us swaad ko bhul jate hai, jab shaadi ke pandal main ghuste hi wo golgappas, bhalle kaa patta uthaa lete hai

 ai lav dis tadi, chocolate:gale se chipkaakar, sirahaane nani maa kii tarah tadi rakhana har ladki ko pasand he
 Now, the boy is starting to say that tadis and chocolate are the way to please a girl
 lekin khud cigarette pine ke baad khai jane vaali centrefresh ko bhul jate hai
 14
 aaj nakad kal udhaar:ladkiyaan hotel, restaurent main bill kaa bhugtan karne se bachati hai
 Because of which the entire weight falls on the male side, if you think so too, then move towards your house, when you ask for money from your sister or best friend
 ladkiyaan paise bachaati hai to aapako hi detii hai
 15
 pyaar nahin paisa:mujhe pyaar nahin paisa chahie
 It is said about girls that all girls have to marry a boy with money
 aise main bipiel se neeche vaale ladakon se meraa bas ek sawaal he ki kya aap bhi ek achche package main naukari nahin chaahate hai
 16
 nonvej jokes:ladakiyon ko nonvej jokes pasand nahin hai or bahut se ladke nonvej jokes ko apni property samajhane lagate hai or maanate hai ki ladkiyaan bahut najuk hoti hai
 But know that boys are not only entitled to non jokes, some girls also like non veg jokes

 hema malini ke saath ye thi aakhri filmrajmata vijayaraaje sindhiya ke jivan par bani film 'ek thi rani aisi bhi' main hema malini ke saath vinod khanna kii aakhri film thi
 The film released nationwide on 21 April

 Apart from him, Vinod Khanna, Sachin Khedekar and Rajesh Shringarpure will also be seen in this film

 vinod khanna ke bare main kuch khaas baaten Sachin Tendulkar broke the record for the most runs in Test cricket against Australia in Mohali on 17th of October 2008 and became the first cricketer to cross 12,000 runs
 is aitihaasik maukey ke uplakshya main sachin ne mujhe ek intervyuu dene kaa vaada kiya tha
 We also contacted Gavaskar for expert comment on this series
 is tarah mohali test ke dauraan ek shaam main cricket nirvana hasil karne ke kareeb pahunchaa jab gavaskar or tendulkar cricket par baat karne ke liye ek saath baithe
 Gavaskar came in a traditional collared shirt, while Tendulkar was in a more casual polo-neck shirt
 unke pahanaave ke is antar se donon ke bich peedi kaa fark jhalkata tha
 Gavaskar and Tendulkar, the two grand achievers, both scored 85 Test centuries and scored more than 26,000 Test runs
 ve hindustani cricket kii do minaaren hai, ek shastreey style ke cricket main rache-based, duusare kahin zyada dhuandhar, donon sadabahaar mahanayake
 More than the tremendous number of runs, what sets them apart is the fact that they represent two generations of Indian cricket
 gavaskar ne hindustani cricket ko agar garima or atmasamman diya, to tendulkar apane saath urja or romaanch laae
 When Gavaskar first saw Tendulkar batting, he called his wife at the same time and said that he had seen something very "special"
 jab tendulkar bade ho rahe the, tab westeindies ke sar vivian richards ke saath gavaskar unke liye role model the
 "I was a tremendous fan of Sir Viv," says Tendulkar, but Gavaskar's 10,000 runs and 34 centuries were always a test of greatness in cricket
 yah koi jaanate-boojhte tay kiya gaya lakshya nahin tha, par mujhe lagata he ki ye mere jehan main kahin na kahin hameshaa se tha
 "tendulkar eventually surpasses Gavaskar's records, yet comparing the absolute figures between the two is not easy
 donon ne test cricket main 50 se zyada ke ausat se ran banaae, par gavaskar opening ballebaaj the, jabaki tendulkar ne number chaar par ballebaaji kii
 One made up for the first round with a helmet, while the other had the advantage of wearing a helmet
 gavaskar lambey vakt tak is ehsaas ke saath khelte rahe ki bhartiya ballebaaji kaa puraa daaromadar unke upar he, jabaki tendulkar ko kariyar ke duusare aadhe hisse main sahvaag, dravid or lakshmana sahit hindustani ballebaaji ke sitaron ke durlabh jamaavade kaa hissaa hone kaa phayda mila
 Gavaskar rose high in a period when defensive batting used to be beneficial, while Tendulkar's phase witnessed a move towards more aggressive batting in cricket
 gavaskar ne simit overon ke cricket main keval ek antarrashtriya saikadaa jadaa, jabaki tendulkar ne avishwasaneey 49 van-de shatak lagaae
 Like all great players, they could adapt themselves to any situation
 tendulkar ne ek baar 2004 main australia ke khilaaf sidney main bheeshan jeevat ke saath 600 se zyada minute ballebaaji kii or gusse main ek bhi gend of-drive maare bagaiyr naabad doharaa shatak banaaya
 Meanwhile, Gavaskar changed his pace and attacked the English bowling, scoring a double century at the Oval in 1979 and bringing India to an incredible victory on the last day
 donon kii ballebaaji kii style ekadam alahada thi
 Gavaskar, playing with a more precise posture, used a relatively lighter bat and kept the two legs closer to each other with a slight shuffle before the bowler missed the ball
 vahiin, tendulkar kahin zyada baari balle or gaiyrparamparaagat bottm hand grip ke saath thodaa zyada jhukate the or pairon ko kaaphi kholkar chaudaa rakhte the
 Gavaskar might have made a better cut, while Tendulkar was more effective in the pull shot
 tendulkar kii pahchaan ban gaya unka back foot cover drive dekhnaa utana hi shandaar hota tha jitna gavaskar kaa let cat shot dekhnaa
 Both were masters of their own straight drive, leg-side click and single
 alabatta, jo dhaagaa unamem saajha tha, vah tha bilkul sahi vakt par unki sadhi hui hulchale, unke shantchitt or sthir sir, unke ballon kii stretanus or tamaam duusari chizon se badhkar unka jabardast jeevat or ranon kii bhukh
 Gavaskar handed over the legacy to Tendulkar just as the previous generation handed him the torch
 tendulkar yaad karte hai, ''mujhe yaad he jab gavaskar ne apane pad mujhe tohfe main die the, main unhen lekar yah soya tha kyonki yah mere liye anmol khajaane kii tarah tha
 "tendulkar received his most valuable accolades during the turn of the century when the legendary Australian batsman Sir Don Bradman, considered the greatest batsman of all time, said that Tendulkar's tight, aggressive batting style and his own style are very similar
 don breadman kii tarif ke kuch maheenon baad maine sachin tendulkar kaa intervyuu kiya tha or saaf taur par is tulana se ve foole nahin samaa rahe the
 He proudly said, "I don't think as a batsman i could want anything more than this, what could i want?" Sachin Tendulkar was the only Indian player in Don Bradman's team of eleven greatest cricketers of all time, But Bradman's inclusion of a full seven Australian players in that team suggests that parochialism often dominated cricket's selection
 unki ballebaaji kii zyada baarik parakh ke liye main milind rege ke paas gaya jo mumbai ke diggaj cricketer hai or theth unke skool ke dinon se hi gavaskar ke saath cricket khele the or vahi un bilkul pehle shaks main se bhi the jinaki tendulkar kii pratibha par najar padi thi
 He says, "it is very difficult to compare the greats of two different generations
 lekin main itnaa jarur kahuunga ki tendulkar vilakshan pratibha ke dhani the jabaki sunil nahin the
 Gavaskar worked on his game and with his amazing ability to concentrate he became an all-time great player while Tendulkar was a fully prepared and flourished player by the age of 15
 gavaskar ek baar set hone ke baad aapako koi mauka nahin dete the, jabaki sachin hameshaa hamale kii taak main rahaa karte the or isliye unke galati karne kii zyada sambhaavna thi
 In a sense, Sachin was more like Viv Richards in his desire to dominate the bowling while Gavaskar was a traditional mistakeless opener batsman
 " to, maine rege se poocha, aap apni team main kise lenaa chaahoge
 "can't i take both?" He said blinking
 phir ve aage bole, ''chalo main ise is tarah kahata hum, mujhe sachin ko apni team main lenaa bahut acha lagegaa, par mujhe gavaskar ko saamne vaali team main jane dena bahut kharaab lagegaa
 "kapil Dev, who has bowled for both, points out that Gavaskar was very difficult to dismiss, but Tendulkar was more talented
 kapil bataate hai, ''gavaskar hameshaa kharaab ball par chaukaa lagaate the, lekin sachin acchhee gend ko bhi boundry ke baahar pahunchaa sakate the
 "A top all-rounder from India believes that Sachin should have scored more runs than he actually scored
 ve tark dete hue kehete hai, ''apane kaushal ke saath unhen test cricket main vastav main tihara or chauharaa shatak bananaa chahie tha, sachin itnaa acha khilaadi tha
 "tendulkar's highest score in Test cricket is an unbeaten 248 against Bangladesh, which probably seems statistically a bit low, especially when you think that contemporary players like Virender Sehwag scored two triple centuries in Tests
 yah sambhawatah ek maansikta kaa sanket karti he, jo jokhim na lene vaali hoti he, khaskar tab, jab vipakshi gendbaaj thakaa or murajhaayaa hua tha
 When i asked Tendulkar about this, he smiled and said, "you can't get everything in life, but around 16,000 runs in Test cricket is not too bad either, is it?" Gavaskar's captaincy record is better , But one could argue that Tendulkar did not get enough opportunity to lead the team in very favorable domestic conditions
 unhone ek baar mujhe bataaya tha, ''haa, ek safal captaini nahin kar paane kaa mujhe afsos he
 "gavaskar, who is very vocal and sharp-minded, has spoken more publicly on cricket issues than often the introverted and diplomatic Tendulkar
 tendulkar ne kabhi match phixing vivaad par majbootee se apana paksh nahin rakhaa
 He told me, "I speak only when the need is felt, but i do not believe in speaking lightly on the basis of allegations
" "mohali main ek sanyukt intervyuu ke dauraan jab maine gavaskar or tendulkar se poocha ki donon main koun behatar khilaadi he, to donon ne turant ek-duusare kii taraf ishaara kiya
 Gavaskar said, "I will go for miles to see Tendulkar's batting, but i am not sure that i will be able to say so on my occasion
" " unhone kaha ki tendulkar kaa santulan unki safalataa ko maapne kaa sahi upaay tha
 "balance in the field, balance in life
" " tendulkar ne kaha ki gavaskar kii peshewar naitikta unki peedi ke liye preranadayak tha
 This mutual respect is in a way reflective of Maharashtra's middle-class background, which is part of the shared heritage of Mumbai cricket
 ye cricket shahar ke maidaanon main poshit hua or jise match dekhne ke liye bheed bhari bason or train kii yatra ne majboot banaaya
 Gavaskar started the game from a narrow lane in a crowded colony in south-central Mumbai, where instead of high shots, the ball had to be placed adjacent to the ground so that no window panes were broken
 upnagareey mumbai kii ghani basti sahitya sahavaas colony main khilne vaale tendulkar ko thodi swatantraaa thiah jahaan aap lofted shot maar sakate the, kisi ped par prahaar kar sakate the, phir bhi out hone kaa dar nahin tha, jo unke joshilay khel kaa vishleshan kar saktaa he
 Perhaps the difference between Gavaskar and Tendulkar can be seen as pre-liberalization and post-cricket heroes
 1960 ke dashak main jab gavaskar kaa ubhaar hua, to bharat vishwa main apane sthaan ko lekar aashwast nahin tha
 When he played the first series in 1971, it was a year of success that raised hopes for the future of Indian cricket
 lekin gavaskar ke kariyar ke dauraan bharat kaa vikaas bahut dhimi gati se ho rahaa tha, jise ''hindu" vikaas dar kaha jaataa he or cricket ko zyaadaatar nazarandaaj kiya gaya-yah vah samay tha, jab cricket par bahut zyada kharch karne kii ijaajat nahin thi
 But when Tendulkar made his mark, India had become a moving nation: The open economy in 1991 was seen as a liberation from the shackles for Indian entrepreneurship
 tendulkar kii ballebaaji vyapak swatantraaa or jokhim lene kii bhaavana kaa pratik ban gaya
 Both of them come from Mumbai, it only shows how the city has been at the center of Indian batting in the sixty years after independence
 haalanki pichley ek dashak main alag sanket saamne aae hai, jo dikhaate hai ki mumbai cricket ke gaurav ke din khatm ho gaye hai, kyonki desh ke anya kshetron ne bhi apane nayak bhartiya cricket ko die hai
 (in 2016, when the first Test match was played after Tendulkar retired at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai, there was no Mumbai player in it
 ) lekin gavaskar-tendulkar kii ballebaaji kii viraasat ke prati sammaan bhartiya cricket kii mul rajdhani main kaayam he
 Gavaskar was the God of cricket in our generation
 nauven dashak kii peedi ke liye tendulkar cricket ke bhagwaan ban gaye
 The Siddhivinayak Temple in the heart of Mumbai attracts millions of devotees, just like the Haji Ali Dargah
 alag-alag dharmik samoohon ke log yahaan ibaadat karne aate hai
 But there is no religious bond in cricket when we honor our gods Gavaskar and Tendulkar with equal enthusiasm in Mumbai

 The effect of this is that to make a dent in Lalu Prasad's Yadav vote bank, BJP has so far given place to 22 Yadav candidates in the shade of 'kamal'
 ravivaar ko bijepi ne teen yadav ummidavaaron ko tarjeeh di he
 Under this, Phula Devi has got Govindpur, Ramsunder Yadav from Phulparas and Birendra Gop have got Islampur Settlement, while an English newspaper has quoted sources as saying that the NDA coalition is preparing to field three more Yadav candidates
 rajya kii kul jansankhya main 14
 6 percent are Yadavs
 badale-badale se tevaryah aankade dilachasp hai, kyonki abhi tak bijepi ko savarnon kii party ke taur par dekha jaataa rahaa he
 Not only this, the party has never given ticket to the Yadavas in double digits in the state so far, but this time, obviously the attitude has changed
 bijepi ke liye is baar mauka bhi he or dastur bhi
 In the event of an alliance with JDU, the BJP always had to be content with double digit numbers in terms of seats, but this time the party is contesting 160 seats
 bijepi kii pehali koshish yadav vot bank main send lagaana he, kyonki rajya main yadav or musalmaan kii jodi ke bal par hi argedy-jediu bijepi ke khilaaf sampradayawad kii kathith ladaai lard rahi he
 In such a situation, if she manages to break the Yadavas, then it will be a big blow to the grand alliance
 yahi nahin, lalu prasad kii party 101 siton par hi chunaav lard rahi he, jabaki 101 siten nitish ke khate main he or samajha ja rahaa he ki jediu yadav ummidavaaron ko kam tarjeeh degi
 What the figures say is 16% of the total population of Mathemabihar is Muslim
 yani yadav or musalmaan milakar kul 30 fisadi kii aabaadi ho jaati he
 Whether it is the bjp-led NDAKI or the jdu-rjd-congress grand alliance, everyone's eyes are on this vote bank
 haalanki, in sab ke bich rajya main is baar asadauddin ovaisi kii party eimm bhi chunaav ke maidan main he or isse muslim vot ke bikharane kii sambhaavna he
 Similarly, the SP and NCP, who have entered the fray by creating a third front, are also preparing to find their land against the Grand Alliance

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi will resolve the bjp's quarrel in Rajasthan
 rajasthan kii dausa loksabhaa seat ko lekar bijepi main mache ghamaasan kaa faisla shuukravaar ko dilli main kiya jayega
 In fact, the BJP has announced candidates for its 23 seats in the state and one seat has been given to Hanuman Beniwal as an alliance
 baavjood iske party 11 dinon se ek seat par faisla nahin kar paa rahi he
 The Congress has fielded Savita Meena, the wife of MLA Murari Lal Meena, 15 days ago as its candidate for the Dausa seat
 bijepi kaa jhagada yahaan itnaa zyada he ki ummidavaaron ke naam par faisla nahin ho paa rahaa he, lihaaja kirodi laal meena ko bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ne dilli bulaayaa he or kaha ja rahaa he ki pradhanmantri narendra modi bhi meena se mulaakaat karenge
 Kirori Lal Meena and Vasundhara Raje have a figure of thirty-six
 vasundhara raaje se naaraaz hokar hi kirodi laal meena ne bijepi ko chhod kar rashtriya janatantric party banaai thi
 At the behest of Rashtriya Swayam Sangh and Amit Shah, Meena joined BJP just before the assembly elections
 bijepi ke paas kirodi se bada meena netaa kabhi nahin rahaa he
 It is also true that Meena's vote bank has always been Congress
 kirodi laal meena kii vajah se meena bijepi se jude rahe hai
 In the last election, under the pressure of central leaders, Vasundhara Raje included Meena in the party but was never formed between the two
 ab jabaki vasundhara ke dhur virdohi hanuman beniwal ko nagaur seat de di gai he, vahiin vasundhara ke virodh ke baavjood rajsamand loksabhaa seat se jaipur kii rajkumaari diya singh ko tikat de diya gaya he
 In such a situation, now Vasundhara has put her veto against Kirodi Lal Meena's candidate of choice in Dausa seat
 vahiin vasundhara raaje chaahati hai ki vahaan par kirodi laal meena ke khilaaf gut ke jascor meena ko dausa se bijepi ke ummidavaar ke rup main utaara jaae, jabaki dausa seat shuru se kirodi laal meena ke liye khaas rahi he
 He does not want it to go to someone else just from him
 dausa se kirodi laal meena naa keval rajesh payalat ke khilaaf bijepi ke tikat par chunaav lard chuke hai balki nirdaleey bhi yahaan se saansad rah chuke hai
 Vasundhara Raje has brought local Meena leader Om Prakash Hoodla of the place since Kirori Lal Meena left the BJP and Om Prakash Hoodla won the Mahua Assembly seat
 haalanki kirodi laal meena ke aane ke baad bijepi ke nae meena netaa omprakash hudla kaa tikat kaat diya gaya or unki jagah kirodi laal meena ke bhattije rajendra meena ko tikat diya gaya
 In the last assembly elections, Rajendra Meena, nephew of Kirori Lal Meena, was defeated by Omprakash Hoodla in the independent election and defeated Rajendra Meena
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki is baar ke loksabhaa chunaav main vasundhara chaah raheen thi ki hudla kii patni yaa phir hulla ko dausa seat se ladaaya jaae
 When it did not happen, Kirori Lal has exposed Jaskaur Meena from Meena's other rival camp and it is being said that Vasundhara Raje is so upset this time that she has not yet gone out on election campaign
 mana ja rahaa he ki aaj amit shah or narendra modi ke hastkshep ke baad dausa seat par bijepi ke ummidavaar kaa elaan kar diya jayega
 The BJP high command has decided to convince Jasunda Meena to contest from Dausa seat to convince Vasundhara
 magar kirodi laal meena kii naaraazgi kii vajah se ye sambhav nahin ho paa rahaa he
 The trouble for the BJP is that if Kirodi Lal Meena is not the candidate of choice, he can make it difficult for the bjp's Dausa seat, as well as it can affect the 12 Meena-dominated seats around Dausa

 dakshin dilli ke kushak naale kii safai na hone ke mudde par dilli hycourt ne sakht rukh apanaaya he
 The court has ordered the secretary of the Union Urban Development Ministry to appear in the court on December 11 along with the officials of Delhi
 court ne iske alaava dilli jal board, dakshin dilli emsidi or peedblyoody ke sambandhit adhikariyon ko bhi pesh hone ke aadesh die hai
 Actually, the pictures of Kushak Nalla had reached the court through the petitioner
 isamen jagah-jagah kooday or malbe ke dher dikhaai de rahe hai
 But misleading government officials kept telling the court that everything seems clean here
 unhen safai kii jarurat hi mahasoos nahin hoti
 But when the petitioner Manjit Chughne showed these pictures of the Kushak drain to the Delhi High Court, the court officials became angry
 iske court ne centre or rajya sarkaron ke alag alag vibhaagon ke adhikariyon ko 11 disambar ko pesh hone ke aadesh de die
 The court said that when we talk about appointing a commissioner in this case, the officials say that they will complete the work quickly
 lekin safai kaa kaam kushak naale main kabhi bhi puraa kyon nahin hota
 It is worth noting that this is not the first time that the authorities have been summoned in the court due to the increasing dirt in the Kushak drain
 darasal peedblyoody ne pichhali sunwaayee par court se vaada kiya tha ki safai kaa kaam jald puraa kar liya jayega, lekin naalon kii safai kaa koi kaam puraa nahin hua
 Especially the cleaning work of the Kushak drain

 court main yachikakarta ne jab tasviir dikhaate hue kaha ki abhi tak naale kii safai hui hi nahin he
 Whereas everything from the authorities in the High Court is told in the status report that the cleaning work is almost complete
 iene se yamuna nadi tak ja rahe kushak naale kii safai ko lekar ab 11 disambar kii hai court main hone vaali sunwaayee kaafii ahm hogi
 Delhi High Court has been hearing the petition related to the cleaning of Kushak drain for the last 6 years

 He has also strongly criticized the BCCI for opposing DRS
 lords par emsisi spirit aaf cricket coudre vyaakhyaan dete hue greg ne kaha ki indian premier lig or chanmpiens lig kii kamyaabi se karodon dollars kamaane par amada bisisiai ke ravaiye ke kaaran test cricket kii upeksha ho rahi he
 He said that India should abandon its selfish attitude towards the problems of the game and emulate the 'spirit of cricket'
 unhone kaha, ‘bharat ke liye ipel or champiens lig antarrashtriya kaarykram se adhik ahm ho gaye hai
 India has sold some part of the game to private interests and due to the conflict of interest of some of its administrators, it has become difficult to work with the spirit of the game
 ’greg ne kaha, ‘test cricket ke prati bharat ke pakshpatpurna ravaiye or kuch khaas masalon par uske ruukh, isisi bhrashtachar jaanch ko lekar ravaiye, doping nirodhak niyamon ko lagu karne kii shighrata par udasin ravaiye, ipel par bhrashtachar ke kathith saaye or austrailia ke purv pradhanmantri jaanau harvard ko isisi kaa upaadhyaksh banane se rokane kii prakriya ke abhaav main isaki bhoomika kuch udhaaharan hai
 Greg also accused the BCCI of grabbing their votes in ICC meetings by threatening small countries
 unhone kaha, ‘cricket par bisisiai kaa niyantran adhik he kyonki iske paas isisi kii baithkon main kisi bhi prastaav kaa virodh karne ke liye paryaapt vot hote hai
 The reason for this is that the survival of some countries cannot go on without financial help from India
 ’greg ne kaha, ‘isisi kii kai samasyayen sulajh jaayegi yadi bharat sweekaar kar le ki karodo dollars kamaane or cricketron ko dhankuber banane se adhik mahatvapurn cricket kii bhaavana he
 He also slammed the BCCI for not accepting DRS
 unhone kaha, ‘yah khel ke liye acha nahin he jab media kii sukhiryon main kharaab faisle hon jinase khel ke nattejey par asar padaa ho
 DRS is not 100 per cent correct but it can overcome the shortcomings of the decisions of the umpires
 ’greg ne kaha, ‘ise thukaraane ke bharat ke paas do kaaran he
 The first is that its superstars did not have a good experience with DRS in the initial days and secondly BCCI believes that this is not entirely correct
 bhartiya superstar cricketron ko chaiye ki bahumat ke faisle ko maane or diares ko sweekaar karen

 1983 world cap jeetne ke baad jab bharat 1987 ke world cap ke semifinal tak kaa safar jo tay kiya tha or lagaataar duusari baar world cap jeetne kaa sapana dekh rahaa tha, tab england ne bharat se yah mauka chin liya tha
 Today, Australia has snatched this opportunity from India on the magnificent grounds of Sydney once again
 us vaqt captain kapil dev the, aaj mahendra singh dhoni
 Dhoni, who happened to be untouched, has failed today
 aaj kismat ne bhi bharat kaa saath nahin diya, lagaataar saat baar toss jeetne ke baad aaj mahendra singh dhoni toss haar gaye
 Bowling first, India also got quick success
 david warner apane nijee score sirf 12 ran par umesh yadav ke shikaar bane, tab australia kaa score sirf 15 ran tha
 But India could not take advantage of this opportunity
 aron finch or steve smith ke bich duusare wicket ke liye 181 ran kii jo shandaar saajhedaari hui or is saajhedaari bharat se match chin liya
 Finch, who scored just 64 runs in the last five matches, played a superb 81 against India and Steve Smith had no answer
 ek baar phir bharat ke khilaaf smith ne shandaar shatak jadaa
 India lost the match when Steve Smith was dismissed for 105 as the second wicket
 ab australia ko rokna mushkil tha
 After Steve Smith's dismissal, the Indian bowlers did manage to take a few wickets but failed to stop Mitchell Johnson
 johnson ne sirf 9 gendon kaa saamana karte hue tej 27 ran banaaye or australia ke score ko 328 ran par pahunchaa diya
 Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja did little to stop the Australian batsmen but Mohammed Shami, Umesh Yadav and Mohit Sharma were hit a lot
 teenon ne milakar kul milakar 29 over main 215 ran die
 India never seemed to dominate during batting
 haa ek vaqt jab rohit sharma or shikhar dhawan ke bich pehle wicket ke liye 76 ranon kii shandaar saajhedaari hui thi tab jeet kii ek kiran nazar ai thi
 Even today, in the history of the World Cup, no team has won, chasing more than 300 runs during a semi-final match
 world cap ke semifinal ke dauraan sabase zyada 298 ran kaa peechha karte hue newzealand ne 2015 ke world cap ke pehle semifinal ke dauraan south africa ko haraaya tha
 Talking about India, India defeated England in the semi-finals of 1983 World Cup chasing the highest score of 213 runs
 aise bhi bharat ne world cap ke semifinal main chaahe pehle ballebaaji kii ho yaa ranon kaa peechha kiya ho, kabhi bhi 300 se zyada ran nahin banaae hai
 India's highest score in the World Cup semi-finals has been 270 runs and this score was made by India during the first World Cup semi-final of the 2003 World Cup against Kenya
 bharat ke ballebaajon ne aaj niraash kiya
 Despite losing well, India lost the match
 australia ne apane bowling power play yani pehle das over main ek wicket par 56 ran banaae the jabaki bharat ne bina wicket khoe 55 ran bana liye the or match bharat ke haath main tha
 From 15 to 30 overs, where Australia saved wickets and managed to hold on to the match, the Indian batsmen lost their wickets and lost the match, playing bad shots
 wicket haath main hone kii vajah se australia ne apane batting powerple yani paanch over main 64 ran banaae jabaki bharat sirf 26 ran bana sakaa
 Dhoni scored the highest 65 runs for India but could not bring India closer to victory
 jab bharat ke saamne australia ne 329 ran kaa lakshya rakhaa tha tab match bharat ke haath se nikal gaya tha
 The source of victory is also not with India today
 shikhar dhawan ne jab bhi 50 se zyada ran banaae hai tab bharat ne apane sabhi match jite hai
 But Dhawan was able to score only 45 runs today
 bharat ne 30 over tak jab-jab 3 se kam wicket khoe hai tab bharat ko 70 pratishat se bhi zyada maichon main jeet mili he
 But today India had lost four wickets for 130 runs by 30 overs
 michel stark ne jab bhi bharat ke khilaaf do yaa zyada wicket liye hai tab australia ko 92 pratishat maichon main jeet mili he or aaj stark ko do wicket bhi mili
