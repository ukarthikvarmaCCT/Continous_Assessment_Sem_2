i am neither an opponent, nor an avatar nor the divine self
 is abhiyog ko asweekaar karne ke liye aaie tathyon par gaur karen
 According to these friends of mine, due to the unnecessary fame i got during the Delhi Bomb Case and Lahore Conspiracy Case, i have probably become old-fashioned
 meraa naastikatawaad koi abhi haal kii utpatti nahin he
 i had stopped believing in God when i was a young man
 kam se kam ek kalege kaa vidhyaarthee to aise kisi anuchit ahankaar ko nahin paal-pos saktaa, jo use naastikta kii ore le jaye
 Although i was a favorite of some teachers and some others i did not like
 par main kabhi bhi bahut mehnatee athwa padhaaku vidhyaarthee nahin rahaa
 There was no chance to get caught in the ego-like feeling
 main to ek bahut lajjalu swabhaav kaa ladkaa tha, jisaki bhavishya ke bare main kuch nirashaavadi prakruti thi
 My Baba, under whose influence i grew up, is a conservative Arya Samaj
 ek arya samaji or kuch bhi ho, naastik nahin hota
 After completing my primary education, i d
 e
 V
 skool, lahore main pravesh liya or puure ek saal uske chatravaas main rahaa
 Apart from morning and evening prayers, i used to chant Gayatri Mantra for hours
 un dinon main puraa bhakt tha
 Later i started living with my father
 jahaan tak dharmik roodhiwaadita kaa prashn he, vah ek udaaravaadi vyakti hai
 His education inspired me to dedicate my life to the cause of freedom
 kintu ve naastik nahin hai
 He has a strong belief in God
 ve mujhe pratidin puja-prarthana ke liye protsaahit karte rahete the
 This is how i was raised
 asahyog aandolan ke dinon main rashtriya kalege main pravesh liya
 It was only here that i began to think, think, and criticize liberally about all religious problems - even the existence of God
 par abhi bhi main pakkaa aastik tha
 Till that time i had long hair
 yadhyapi mujhe kabhi-bhi sikh yaa anya dharmon kii puranikta or siddhanton main vishwaas na ho sakaa tha
 But i had strong faith in the existence of God
 baad main main krantikari party se judaa
 The first leader i met there could not have dared to deny the existence of God even though he had no firm faith
 ishwar ke bare main mere hath purvak poochhate rahane par ve kehete, 'jab ichha ho, tab puja kar liya karo
 'this is atheism, which lacks courage
 duusare netaa, jinke main sampark main aayaa, pakke shraddhalu aadarneey kamred shacheendra nath sanyaal aajkal kakori shadyantra cese ke silsile main aaajeevan kaarvaas bhoga rahe hai
 His book 'bandi Jeevan' is a loud anthem of the glory of God
 unhone usamen ishwar ke upar prashansa ke pushp rahasyatmak veydant ke kaaran barasaaye hai
 The 'revolutionary' (revolutionary) form that was distributed across India on January 28, 1925, is the result of his intellectual labor
 usamen sarvashaktimaan or uski lila or kaaryon kii prashansa kii gai he
 My mistrust of God did not even arise in the revolutionary party
 kakori ke sabhi chaar shaheedon ne apane antim din bhajan-prarthana main gujaarey the
 Ram Prasad 'bismil' was an orthodox Arya Samaji
 samaajwaad or samyawad main apane vrihad adhyayan ke baavjood rajen lahadi upanishad evam gita ke shlokon ke uccharan kii apni abhilaashaa ko dabaa na sake
 i saw only one person among them who never prayed and said, "philosophy arises due to the weakness of man or limited knowledge
" vah bhi aaajeevan nirvaasan kii sajaa bhoga rahaa he
 But he too never dared to deny the existence of God
 is samay tak main keval ek romantic adarshavaadi krantikari tha
 Till now we used to follow others
 ab apane kandhon par zimmedaari uthaane kaa samay aayaa tha
 This was a defining point in my revolutionary life
 ‘adhyayan’ kii pukaar mere man ke galiyaaron main gunj rahi thi– virodhiyon dwaara rakhe gayi tarkon kaa saamana karne yogya banane ke liye adhyayan karo
 Read to be able to argue in favor of your opinion
 maine padhanaa shuru kar diya
 This refined my old thoughts and beliefs wonderfully
 romance kii jagah gambheer vichaaron ne le lee, na or adhik rahasyavaad, na hi andhvishwaas
 Realism became our basis
 mujhe vishvakranti ke anek aadarshon ke bare main padhane kaa khub mauka mila
 i read Buchanin, the anarchist leader, Marx, the father of communism, but more Lenin, Tratsky, and others who successfully brought revolution in their country
 ye sabhi naastik the
 Later i got the book 'sahaj Gyan' by Niralamb Swami
 isamen rahasywaadee naastikta thi
 By the end of 1926, i was convinced that the talk of an almighty supreme soul, who created, guided and operated the universe, is a blatant nonsense
 maine apane is avishvaas ko pradarshit kiya
 i debated this topic with my friends
 main ek ghoshit naastik ho chukaa tha
 In May 1927 i was arrested in Lahore
 railway police hawalat main mujhe ek maheenaa kaatna padaa
 The police officers told me that i was in Lucknow when the Kakori team was under trial, that i had talked about some plan to get them released, that we had obtained some bombs after getting their consent, that in 1927 Dussehra On the occasion of one of those bombs was thrown at the crowd for testing, that if i make a statement highlighting the activities of the revolutionary party, i will not be arrested and To the contrary will be i will be released without presenting the informant in court and reward
 main is prastaav par hansaa
 It was all useless
 ham logon kii bhaanti vichaar rakhane vaale apni nirdosh janata par bam nahin phenkaa karte
 One day in the morning c

 ke varisht adheekshak shri newman ne kaha ki yadi maine vaisaa vaktavy nahin diya, to mujh par kakori cese se sambandhit vidroh chhedane ke shadyantra or dashahra updrav main krur hatyaon ke liye mukadmaa chalaane par baadhya honge or ki unke paas mujhe sajaa dilaane or faansee par latakavane ke liye uchit pramaan hai
 From the same day, some police officers started luring me to praise God both times by the rule
 par ab main ek naastik tha
 i wanted to decide for myself whether in the days of peace and joy, i boast of being an atheist or even in such difficult times, i can stick to those principles
 bahut sochane ke baad maine nishchay kiya ki kisi bhi tarah ishwar par vishwaas or prarthana main nahin kar saktaa
 No, i did not do it even for a moment
 yahi asli pareekshan tha or main safal rahaa
 Now i was a firm believer and have been consistent ever since
 is pareekshan par khara utarana aasaan kaam na tha
 'faith' lightens the sufferings
 yahaan tak ki unhen sukhkar bana saktaa he
 In God, a base can be found that is extremely comforting to man
 uske bina manushya ko apane upar nirbhar karnaa padataa he
 Standing on your feet between the storm and the storm is not a child's play
 pariksha kii in ghadiyon main ahankaar yadi he, to bhaap ban kar ud jaataa he or manushya apane vishwaas ko thukaraane kaa saahas nahin kar paata
 If it does, then it leads to the conclusion that it has no other power but just ego
 aaj bilkul waisi hi sthiti he
 The full address of the decision is
 ek saptaah ke andar hi yah ghoshit ho jaayegaa ki main apana jivan ek dhyey par nyochaavar karne ja rahaa hum
 Apart from this idea, what else could be the consolation? ishwar main vishwaas rakhane vaala hindu punarjanm par raja hone kii aashaa kar saktaa he
 a Muslim or Christian can imagine the joy of prosperity in heaven and the rewards for their sufferings and sacrifices
 kintu main kya aashaa karun? main jaanata hum ki jis kshan rassi kaa fanda meri gardan par lagegaa or mere pairon ke neeche se takhta hatega, vah purna viraam hoga– vah antim kshan hoga
 i or my soul will all end there
 aage kuch na rahegaa
 a small battling life, which has no such glorious culmination, will be an award in itself - if i have the courage to see it from this point of view
 bina kisi swaarth ke yahaan yaa yahaan ke baad puraskaar kii ichha ke bina, maine anasakt bhav se apane jivan ko swatantrata ke dhyey par samarpit kar diya he, kyonki main or kuch kar hi nahin saktaa tha
 The day we will find many men and women of this mentality, who cannot devote their lives to anything other than the service of man and the salvation of the suffering humanity, the same day will be the beginning of the era of liberation
 ve shoshakon, utpeedakon or atyaachaariyon ko chunauti dene ke liye utprerit honge
 Not because he has to become king or get any other award here or in next life or after death in heaven
 unhen to maanavtaa kii gardan se daastaa kaa jua utaar phenkane or mukti evam shaanti sthapit karne ke liye is maarg ko apnaanaa hoga
 Will they walk the path that is dangerous for them but the only imaginable path for their great soul
 kya is mahaan dhyey ke prati unke garv ko ahankaar kahkar uskaa galat arth lagaaya jaayegaa? koun is prakaar ke ghrunit visheshan bolne kaa saahas karegaa? yaa to vah murkh he yaa dhoort
 We need to forgive him, because he cannot feel the high thoughts, feelings, impulses and their depths that are instilled in that heart
 uskaa hriday maance ke ek tukade kii tarah mrit he
 Her eyes are weakened by the shadow of the phantoms of other interests
 swayan par bharosa rakhane ke gun ko sadaiv ahankaar kii sangya di ja sakati he
 It is painful and annoying, but what is the choice? aalochana or swatantra vichaar ek krantikari ke donon anivaary gun hai
 Because our ancestors had built faith in some supreme soul
 atah koi bhi vyakti jo us vishwaas ko satyata yaa us param aatma ke astitv ko hi chunauti de, usko vidharmee, vishwasghaatee kaha jaayegaa
 If his arguments are so irrefutable that he cannot be rebutted by reason and his faith is so strong that he cannot be suppressed by showing fear of the plagues caused by the wrath of God, then he will be reprimanded by saying that he is boisterous
 yah meraa ahankaar nahin tha, jo mujhe naastikta kii ore le gaya
 The way my reasoning proves to be satisfactory is to be decided by my readers, not me
 main jaanata hum ki ishwar par vishwaas ne aaj meraa jivan aasaan or meraa boj halakaa kar diya hota
 My mistrust of him has made the whole atmosphere very dry
 thodaa-sa rahasyavaad ise kavitvamay bana saktaa he
 But my fate does not need any frenzy
 main yathartwaadee hum
 i want victory over inner nature with the help of conscience
 is dhyey main main sadaiv safal nahin hua hum
 It is man's duty to try
 safalataa to sanyog or vaataavaran par nirbhar he
 Someone who is a bit rational, would try to understand their environment logically
 jahaan sidhaa pramaan nahin he, vahaan darshan shaastra kaa mahatv he
 When our ancestors tried to understand the mystery of the world, its past, present and future, its why and where at the time of leisure, every person in the difficult lack of direct results solved these questions in their own way
 yahi kaaran he ki vibhinn dharmik maton main hamako itnaa antar miltaa he, jo kabhi-kabhi vaimnasy or jhagade kaa rup le letaa he
 Not only are there differences in views of East and West, but each hemisphere has differences among its different views
 purv ke dharmon main, islam or hindu dharm main zaraa bhi anurupata nahin he
 In India itself, Buddhism and Jainism are very different from Brahmanism, in which opposing opinions like Arya Samaj and Sanatan Dharma are found
 puraane samay kaa ek swatantra vichaarak charvak he
 He challenged God in the old times itself
 har vyakti apane ko sahi maanata he
 It is unfortunate that instead of the old thinkers' experiences and ideas as the basis of the fight against ignorance in the future, we, like slackers, continue to shout the unwavering and unshakeable faith in the statement of what we have proved and The types are guilty of rooting the development of humanity
 sirf vishwaas or andh vishwaas khataranaak he
 It makes the brain dumb and human reactionary
 jo manushya apane ko yathartwaadee hone kaa daawa karata he, use samast pracheen rudhigat vishwaason ko chunauti deni hogi
 The prevailing opinion has to be tested on the basis of logic
 yadi ve tark kaa prahaar na sah sake, to tukade-tukade hokar gir padegaa
 Then to establish the new philosophy, to make them completely dashed, to clear the place and to reconstruct using some things of the old beliefs
 main pracheen vishwaason ke thospan par prashn karne ke sambandh main aashwast hum
 i firmly believe that a conscious supreme soul, who guides and guides the movement of nature, has no existence
 ham prakruti main vishwaas karte hai or samast pragatisheel aandolan kaa dhyey manushya dwaara apni seva ke liye prakruti par vijay praapt karnaa maanate hai
 There is no conscious power behind this direction
 yahi hamaara darshan he
 We want to ask the believers some questions
 yadi aapkaa vishwaas he ki ek sarvashaktimaan, sarvavyaapak or sarvagyani ishwar he, jisane vishwa kii rachana kii, to krupa karke mujhe yah bataayen ki usne yah rachana kyon kii? kashton or santapon se purna duniya – asankhya dukhon ke shaashvat anant gathbandhanon se grasit! ek bhi vyakti to puri tarah santrusht nahi he
 Please do not say that this is his rule
 yadi vah kisi niyam se bandhaa he to vah sarvashaktimaan nahin he
 He is also a slave to rules like us
 krupa karke yah bhi na kahen ki yah uskaa manoranjan he
 Nero had just lit a romp
 usne bahut thodi sankhya main logon kii hatya kii thi
 He caused very little sorrow for his complete entertainment
 or uskaa itihaas main kya sthaan he? use itihaaskaar kis naam se bulaate hai? sabhi vifaille visheshan us par barasaaye jate hai
 The pages are blackened by his blasphemous sentences, denouncing - Nero a heartless, merciless, wicked
 ek changez khan ne apane anand ke liye kuch hajaar jaane le leen or aaj ham uske naam se ghrinaa karte hai
 Then how do you justify your god? To the eternal Nero, who has been, and still continues to give, every day, every hour, and every minute, innumerable miseries
 phir tum kaise uske dushkarmon kaa paksh lene kii sochate ho, jo changez khan se prayek kshan adhik he? kya yah sab baad main in nirdosh ksht sahane waalon ko puraskaar or galati karne waalon ko dand dene ke liye ho rahaa he? thik he, thik he
 How long will you justify the person, who dares to inflict wounds on our body, because later, he will apply soft and comfortable ointments? gladator sanstha ke vyavasthaapak kahaan tak uchit karte the ki ek bhukhe khoonkhaar sher ke saamne manushya ko phenk do ki, yadi vah usase jaan bachaa letaa he, to uski khub dekhbhaal kii jaayegi? isaliye main poochta hum ki us chetan param aatma ne is vishwa or usamen manushyon kii rachana kyon kii? anand luutane ke liye? tab usamen or nero main kya fark he? You Muslims and Christians! You do not believe in past lives
 tum to hinduon kii tarah yah tark pesh nahin kar sakate ki pratyakshtah nirdosh vyaktiyon ke ksht unke purvajanmon ke karmon kaa fal he
 i ask you, why did that Almighty work for six days for the creation of the world by word? And why does he say every day that everything is fine? Call him today
 use pichhlaa itihaas dikhaao
 Let him study today's conditions
 ham dekhenge ki kya vah kehane kaa saahas karata he ki sab thik he
 From imprisonment to slums to slum settlements to millions of starving humans, to exploited laborers who are patiently watching bloodshed by capitalist vampires patiently and watching the waste of manpower that anyone sees Even the person, who has little knowledge, will tremble with fear, and instead of distributing more production to the needy people in the sea To throw it better, to the palaces of the kings whose foundations lay on the bones of human beings - let him see it all and then say - everything is fine! Why and from where? This is my question
 tum chup ho
 Okay, then i go ahead
 or tum hinduon, tum kehete ho ki aaj jo ksht bhoga rahe hai, ye purvajanm ke paapi hai or aaj ke utpeedak pichley janmon main sadhu purush the, atah ve satta kaa anand lut rahe hai
 i have to admit that your ancestors were very clever people
 unhone aise siddhanth gadhe, jinamein tark or avishvaas ke sabhi prayaason ko vifal karne kii kaafii takat he
 According to jurisprudence, punishment can be justified for only three reasons depending on the effect it has on the offender
 ve hai – pratikaar, bhay or sudhaar
 Today the theory of retaliation is condemned by all progressive thinkers
 bhaybheet karne ke siddhanth kaa bhi ant vahiin he
 The principle of reform is only necessary and is essential for the progress of humanity
 iskaa dhyey apradhi ko yogya or shantipriy naagarik ke rup main samaaj ko lautaanaa he
 But even if we consider human beings to be criminals, what is the nature of punishment given to them by God? You say that he produces them by making cows, cats, trees, herbs or animals
 tum aise 84 lakh dandon ko ginate ho
 i ask what effect he has on humans as reformers? How many people have you met who say that they were born as donkeys in a past life due to some sin? not even one? Do not give examples from your Puranas
 mere paas tumhaari puranic kathaon ke liye koi sthaan nahin he
 And then do you know that the biggest sin in the world is to be poor
 garibi ek abhishaap he
 This is a punishment
 main poochta hum ki dand prakriya kii kahaan tak prashansa karen, jo anivarytah manushya ko or adhik aparaadh karne ko baadhya kare? kya tumhaare ishwar ne yah nahin sochaa tha yaa usko bhi ye sari baaten maanavtaa dwaara akathaneey kashton ke jhelane kii keemat par anubhav se seekhni thim? tum kya sochate ho, kisi garib yaa anpadh parivaar, jaise ek chamaar yaa mehtar ke yahaan paidaa hone par insaan kaa kya bhagya hoga? chunki vah garib he, isaliye padhai nahin kar saktaa
 He remains despised and abandoned by his peers, who consider themselves elevated due to being born into an upper caste
 uskaa agyaan, uski garibi or usase kiya gaya vyavhaar uske hriday ko samaaj ke prati nishthur bana dete hai
 If he commits a sin, who will bear the consequences? Ishwar, he himself or the saint of society? And what about the punishments of those whom the arrogant Brahmins deliberately kept ignorant and who had to bear the punishment of having to bear a stream of melted lead in their ears because of listening to some sentences of your sacred books of knowledge - the Vedas? If they commit a crime, who will be responsible for it? And who will bear their blow? mere priy doston! ye siddhanth visheshadhikaar yukt logon ke avishkaar hai
 They justify their captured power, capital and highness on the basis of these principles
 aptaan singhlair ne likhaa tha ki manushya ko bas amartv main vishwaas dilaa do or uske baad uski sari sampatti lut lo
 He will help you in this task without raving
 dharm ke upadeshkon or satta ke swaamiyon ke gathbandhan se hi jail, faansee, kode or ye siddhanth upajte hai
 i ask, why doesn't your all-powerful God stop every person when he is committing a sin or a crime? He can do this very easily
 usne kyon nahin ladaaku raajaaon kii ladane kii ugrata ko samaapt kiya or is prakaar vishwayuddh dwaara maanavtaa par padane vaali vipattiyon se use bachaaya? usne angrejon ke mastishk main bharat ko mukt kar dene kii bhaavana kyon nahin paidaa kii? vah kyon nahin puunjipatiyon ke hriday main yah paropkaaree utsaah bhar detaa ki ve utpaadan ke sadhano par apana vyaktigat sampatti kaa adhikaar tyaag den or is prakaar keval sampoorn shramik samudaay, varan samast maanav samaaj ko poonjivadi bediyon se mukt karen? aap samaajwaad kii vyaavhaarikta par tark karnaa chaahate hai
 i leave it to your almighty to enforce it
 jahaan tak saamaanya bhalaai kii baat he, log samaajwaad ke gunon ko maanate hai
 They oppose it with an excuse of not being practical
 paramatma ko aane do or vah cheez ko sahi tareeke se kar de
 The British rule here is not because God wants but because he has power and we do not have the courage to oppose him
 ve hamako apane prabhutv main ishwar kii madad se nahin rakhe hai, balki banduukon, riflon, bam or goliyon, police or sena ke sahare
 It is our apathy that they are successfully committing the most disgraceful crime against society - complete exploitation of one nation by another
 kahaan he ishwar? kya vah manushya jati ke in kashton kaa mazaa le rahaa he? ek nero, ek changez, uskaa naash ho! Do you ask me how do i explain the origin of this world and the origin of man? Ok let me tell you
 chalrs darvin ne is vishay par kuch prakaash daalane kii koshish kii he
 Read it yah ek prakruti kii ghatana he
 Earth formed by accidental mixing of various substances, in the shape of a nebula
 kab? itihaas dekho
 Animals were born from this type of phenomenon and humans in a long period
 darwin kii ‘jeev kii utpatti’ padho
 And then all the development was done by man's constant opposition to nature and the desire to conquer it
 yah is ghatana kii sambhavtah sabase sookshm vyakhya he
 Your second argument could be why a child is born blind or lame? Is it not the result of the work done in his previous birth? Biologists have found a scientific solution to this problem
 avashya hi tum ek or bachakaana prashn puch sakate ho
 If there is no God, then why did people believe in him? My answer is subtle and clear
 jis prakaar ve preton or dusht atmaaon main vishwaas karne lage
 The only difference is that belief in God is universal and philosophy is highly developed
 isaki utpatti kaa shrey un shoshakon kii pratibha ko he, jo paramatma ke astitv kaa upadesh dekar logon ko apane prabhutv main rakhana chaahate the or unase apni vishisht sthiti kaa adhikaar evam anumodan chaahate the
 All religions, sects, sects and other such institutions eventually become the supporters of ruthless and exploitative institutions, individuals and classes
 raja ke viruddh har vidroh har dharm main sadaiv hi paap rahaa he
 After recognizing man's limitations, understanding his weaknesses and demerits, he is tempted to face bravely at the time of examination, to face all the dangers with masculinity and to tie his eruption into prosperity and majesty
 Fantasy existence was created
 apane vyaktigat niyamon or abhibhavakeey udaartaa se purna ishwar kii badha-chadha kar kalpana evam chithran kiya gaya
 He is used as a fear-monger when he discusses his rage and personal rules
 taaki koi manushya samaaj ke liye khatara na ban jaye
 When his guardian qualities are explained, he is used as a father, mother, brother, sister, friend and helper
 jab manushya apane sabhi doston dwaara vishwasghaat or tyaag dene se atyant klesh main ho, tab use is vichaar se santvana mil sakati he ki ek sadaa sachcha dost uski sahaayta karne ko he, usko sahaara degaa or vah sarvashaktimaan he or kuch bhi kar saktaa he
 In fact it was useful for the society in the primitive period
 pidaa main pade manushya ke liye ishwar kii kalpana upyogi hoti he
 Society has to fight against this belief
 manushya jab apane pairon par khadaa hone kaa prayaas karata he or yathartwaadee ban jaataa he, tab use shraddha ko ek ore phenk dena chahie or un sabhi kashton, pareshaaniyon kaa purushatv ke saath saamana karnaa chahie, jinamein paristhitiyaan use patake sakati hai
 This is my position today
 yah meraa ahankaar nahin he, mere dost! yah mere sochane kaa tarika he, jisane mujhe naastik banaaya he
 The comments ishwar main vishwaas or rose-ba-rose kii prarthana ko main manushya ke liye sabase swaarthee or gira hua kaam maanata hum
 i have read about the atheists who bravely faced all the calamities
 atah main bhi ek purush kii bhaanti faansee ke phande kii antim ghadi tak sir ooncha kiye khadaa rahanaa chahta hum
 We have to see how i manage
 mere ek dost ne mujhe prarthana karne ko kaha
 When i told him about being an atheist, he said, "in your last days you will start believing
" '’ maine kaha, ‘'nahin, pyaare dost, aisa nahin hoga
 i explain this to myself as degrading and corrupt
 swaarthee kaarnon se main prarthana nahin karuunga
 "readers and friends, is this arrogance?" If it is, i accept it
 main aisi koi shekhi nahin bagharta ki main maanviya kamazoriyon se bahut upar hum
 i am a human being, and nothing more
 koi bhi isse adhik hone kaa daawa nahin kar saktaa
 This weakness is also within me
 ahankaar bhi mere swabhaav kaa ang he
 i was called autocratic among my comrades
 yahaan tak ki mere dost shri batukeshwar kumaar dutt bhi mujhe kabhi-kabhi aisa kehete the
 i have also been condemned on many occasions as an arbiter
 kuch doston ko shikaayat he, or gambheer rup se he ki main anachaahe hi apane vichaar, un par thopata hum or apane prastaavon ko manavaa letaa hum
 This is true to some extent
 isse main inkaar nahin karata
 It can be called ego
 jahaan tak anya prachlit maton ke mukaable hamaare apane mat kaa sawaal he
 i am definitely proud of my opinion
 lekin yah vyaktigat nahin he
 It may happen that it is justified pride in its faith and it cannot be called arrogant
 ghamand to swayan ke prati anuchit garv kii adhikta he
 Is it unreasonable pride that led me to atheism? Or did i disbelieve God after studying this subject very carefully and considering it very carefully? main yah samajhane main puri tarah se asafal rahaa hum ki anuchit garv yaa vruthabhimaan kis tarah kisi vyakti ke ishwar main vishwaas karne ke raste main roda ban saktaa he? kisi vastav main mahaan vyakti kii mahanata ko main manyata na duun– yah tabhi ho saktaa he, jab mujhe bhi thodaa aisa yash praapt ho gaya ho jiske yaa to main yogya nahin hum yaa mere andar ve gun nahin hai, jo iske liye aavashyak hai
 Even it makes sense
 lekin yah kaise ho saktaa he ki ek vyakti, jo ishwar main vishwaas rakhata ho, sahasaa apane vyaktigat ahankaar ke kaaran usamen vishwaas karnaa band kar de? do hi raste sambhav hai
 Either man starts thinking of himself as a rival of God or he starts thinking of himself as God
 in donon hi avasthaaon main vah sachcha naastik nahin ban saktaa
 In the first stage, he does not deny the existence of his rival
 duusari avasthaa main bhi vah ek aisi chetana ke astitv ko maanata he, jo parde ke peeche se prakruti kii sabhi gatividhiyon kaa sanchaalan karti he
 i only deny the existence of that almighty supreme soul
 yah ahankaar nahin he, jisane mujhe naastikta ke siddhanth ko grahan karne ke liye prerit kiya
 i am neither an opponent, nor an avatar nor the divine self
 is abhiyog ko asweekaar karne ke liye aaie tathyon par gaur karen
 According to these friends of mine, due to the unnecessary fame i got during the Delhi Bomb Case and Lahore Conspiracy Case, i have probably become old-fashioned
 meraa naastikatawaad koi abhi haal kii utpatti nahin he
 i had stopped believing in God when i was a young man
 kam se kam ek kalege kaa vidhyaarthee to aise kisi anuchit ahankaar ko nahin paal-pos saktaa, jo use naastikta kii ore le jaye
 Although i was a favorite of some teachers and some others i did not like
 par main kabhi bhi bahut mehnatee athwa padhaaku vidhyaarthee nahin rahaa
 There was no chance to get caught in the ego-like feeling
 main to ek bahut lajjalu swabhaav kaa ladkaa tha, jisaki bhavishya ke bare main kuch nirashaavadi prakruti thi
 My Baba, under whose influence i grew up, is a conservative Arya Samaj
 ek arya samaji or kuch bhi ho, naastik nahin hota
 After completing my primary education, i d
 e
 V
 skool, lahore main pravesh liya or puure ek saal uske chatravaas main rahaa
 Apart from morning and evening prayers, i used to chant Gayatri Mantra for hours
 un dinon main puraa bhakt tha
 Later i started living with my father
 jahaan tak dharmik roodhiwaadita kaa prashn he, vah ek udaaravaadi vyakti hai
 His education inspired me to dedicate my life to the cause of freedom
 kintu ve naastik nahin hai
 He has a strong belief in God
 ve mujhe pratidin puja-prarthana ke liye protsaahit karte rahete the
 This is how i was raised
 asahyog aandolan ke dinon main rashtriya kalege main pravesh liya
 It was only here that i began to think, think, and criticize liberally about all religious problems - even the existence of God
 par abhi bhi main pakkaa aastik tha
 Till that time i had long hair
 yadhyapi mujhe kabhi-bhi sikh yaa anya dharmon kii puranikta or siddhanton main vishwaas na ho sakaa tha
 But i had strong faith in the existence of God
 baad main main krantikari party se judaa
 The first leader i met there could not have dared to deny the existence of God even though he had no firm faith
 ishwar ke bare main mere hath purvak poochhate rahane par ve kehete, 'jab ichha ho, tab puja kar liya karo
 'this is atheism, which lacks courage
 duusare netaa, jinke main sampark main aayaa, pakke shraddhalu aadarneey kamred shacheendra nath sanyaal aajkal kakori shadyantra cese ke silsile main aaajeevan kaarvaas bhoga rahe hai
 His book 'bandi Jeevan' is a loud anthem of the glory of God
 unhone usamen ishwar ke upar prashansa ke pushp rahasyatmak veydant ke kaaran barasaaye hai
 The 'revolutionary' (revolutionary) form that was distributed across India on January 28, 1925, is the result of his intellectual labor
 usamen sarvashaktimaan or uski lila or kaaryon kii prashansa kii gai he
 My mistrust of God did not even arise in the revolutionary party
 kakori ke sabhi chaar shaheedon ne apane antim din bhajan-prarthana main gujaarey the
 Ram Prasad 'bismil' was an orthodox Arya Samaji
 samaajwaad or samyawad main apane vrihad adhyayan ke baavjood rajen lahadi upanishad evam gita ke shlokon ke uccharan kii apni abhilaashaa ko dabaa na sake
 i saw only one person among them who never prayed and said, "philosophy arises due to the weakness of man or limited knowledge
" vah bhi aaajeevan nirvaasan kii sajaa bhoga rahaa he
 But he too never dared to deny the existence of God
 is samay tak main keval ek romantic adarshavaadi krantikari tha
 Till now we used to follow others
 ab apane kandhon par zimmedaari uthaane kaa samay aayaa tha
 This was a defining point in my revolutionary life
 ‘adhyayan’ kii pukaar mere man ke galiyaaron main gunj rahi thi– virodhiyon dwaara rakhe gayi tarkon kaa saamana karne yogya banane ke liye adhyayan karo
 Read to be able to argue in favor of your opinion
 maine padhanaa shuru kar diya
 This refined my old thoughts and beliefs wonderfully
 romance kii jagah gambheer vichaaron ne le lee, na or adhik rahasyavaad, na hi andhvishwaas
 Realism became our basis
 mujhe vishvakranti ke anek aadarshon ke bare main padhane kaa khub mauka mila
 i read Buchanin, the anarchist leader, Marx, the father of communism, but more Lenin, Tratsky, and others who successfully brought revolution in their country
 ye sabhi naastik the
 Later i got the book 'sahaj Gyan' by Niralamb Swami
 isamen rahasywaadee naastikta thi
 By the end of 1926, i was convinced that the talk of an almighty supreme soul, who created, guided and operated the universe, is a blatant nonsense
 maine apane is avishvaas ko pradarshit kiya
 i debated this topic with my friends
 main ek ghoshit naastik ho chukaa tha
 In May 1927 i was arrested in Lahore
 railway police hawalat main mujhe ek maheenaa kaatna padaa
 The police officers told me that i was in Lucknow when the Kakori team was under trial, that i had talked about some plan to get them released, that we had obtained some bombs after getting their consent, that in 1927 Dussehra On the occasion of one of those bombs was thrown at the crowd for testing, that if i make a statement highlighting the activities of the revolutionary party, i will not be arrested and To the contrary will be i will be released without presenting the informant in court and reward
 main is prastaav par hansaa
 It was all useless
 ham logon kii bhaanti vichaar rakhane vaale apni nirdosh janata par bam nahin phenkaa karte
 One day in the morning c
 ai
 D
 ke varisht adheekshak shri newman ne kaha ki yadi maine vaisaa vaktavy nahin diya, to mujh par kakori cese se sambandhit vidroh chhedane ke shadyantra or dashahra updrav main krur hatyaon ke liye mukadmaa chalaane par baadhya honge or ki unke paas mujhe sajaa dilaane or faansee par latakavane ke liye uchit pramaan hai
 From the same day, some police officers started luring me to praise God both times by the rule
 par ab main ek naastik tha
 i wanted to decide for myself whether in the days of peace and joy, i boast of being an atheist or even in such difficult times, i can stick to those principles
 bahut sochane ke baad maine nishchay kiya ki kisi bhi tarah ishwar par vishwaas or prarthana main nahin kar saktaa
 No, i did not do it even for a moment
 yahi asli pareekshan tha or main safal rahaa
 Now i was a firm believer and have been consistent ever since
 is pareekshan par khara utarana aasaan kaam na tha
 'faith' lightens the sufferings
 yahaan tak ki unhen sukhkar bana saktaa he
 In God, a base can be found that is extremely comforting to man
 uske bina manushya ko apane upar nirbhar karnaa padataa he
 Standing on your feet between the storm and the storm is not a child's play
 pariksha kii in ghadiyon main ahankaar yadi he, to bhaap ban kar ud jaataa he or manushya apane vishwaas ko thukaraane kaa saahas nahin kar paata
 If it does, then it leads to the conclusion that it has no other power but just ego
 aaj bilkul waisi hi sthiti he
 The full address of the decision is
 ek saptaah ke andar hi yah ghoshit ho jaayegaa ki main apana jivan ek dhyey par nyochaavar karne ja rahaa hum
 Apart from this idea, what else could be the consolation? ishwar main vishwaas rakhane vaala hindu punarjanm par raja hone kii aashaa kar saktaa he
 a Muslim or Christian can imagine the joy of prosperity in heaven and the rewards for their sufferings and sacrifices
 kintu main kya aashaa karun? main jaanata hum ki jis kshan rassi kaa fanda meri gardan par lagegaa or mere pairon ke neeche se takhta hatega, vah purna viraam hoga– vah antim kshan hoga
 i or my soul will all end there
 aage kuch na rahegaa
 a small battling life, which has no such glorious culmination, will be an award in itself - if i have the courage to see it from this point of view
 bina kisi swaarth ke yahaan yaa yahaan ke baad puraskaar kii ichha ke bina, maine anasakt bhav se apane jivan ko swatantrata ke dhyey par samarpit kar diya he, kyonki main or kuch kar hi nahin saktaa tha
 The day we will find many men and women of this mentality, who cannot devote their lives to anything other than the service of man and the salvation of the suffering humanity, the same day will be the beginning of the era of liberation
 ve shoshakon, utpeedakon or atyaachaariyon ko chunauti dene ke liye utprerit honge
 Not because he has to become king or get any other award here or in next life or after death in heaven
 unhen to maanavtaa kii gardan se daastaa kaa jua utaar phenkane or mukti evam shaanti sthapit karne ke liye is maarg ko apnaanaa hoga
 Will they walk the path that is dangerous for them but the only imaginable path for their great soul
 kya is mahaan dhyey ke prati unke garv ko ahankaar kahkar uskaa galat arth lagaaya jaayegaa? koun is prakaar ke ghrunit visheshan bolne kaa saahas karegaa? yaa to vah murkh he yaa dhoort
 We need to forgive him, because he cannot feel the high thoughts, feelings, impulses and their depths that are instilled in that heart
 uskaa hriday maance ke ek tukade kii tarah mrit he
 Her eyes are weakened by the shadow of the phantoms of other interests
 swayan par bharosa rakhane ke gun ko sadaiv ahankaar kii sangya di ja sakati he
 It is painful and annoying, but what is the choice? aalochana or swatantra vichaar ek krantikari ke donon anivaary gun hai
 Because our ancestors had built faith in some supreme soul
 atah koi bhi vyakti jo us vishwaas ko satyata yaa us param aatma ke astitv ko hi chunauti de, usko vidharmee, vishwasghaatee kaha jaayegaa
 If his arguments are so irrefutable that he cannot be rebutted by reason and his faith is so strong that he cannot be suppressed by showing fear of the plagues caused by the wrath of God, then he will be reprimanded by saying that he is boisterous
 yah meraa ahankaar nahin tha, jo mujhe naastikta kii ore le gaya
 The way my reasoning proves to be satisfactory is to be decided by my readers, not me
 main jaanata hum ki ishwar par vishwaas ne aaj meraa jivan aasaan or meraa boj halakaa kar diya hota
 My mistrust of him has made the whole atmosphere very dry
 thodaa-sa rahasyavaad ise kavitvamay bana saktaa he
 But my fate does not need any frenzy
 main yathartwaadee hum
 i want victory over inner nature with the help of conscience
 is dhyey main main sadaiv safal nahin hua hum
 It is man's duty to try
 safalataa to sanyog or vaataavaran par nirbhar he
 Someone who is a bit rational, would try to understand their environment logically
 jahaan sidhaa pramaan nahin he, vahaan darshan shaastra kaa mahatv he
 When our ancestors tried to understand the mystery of the world, its past, present and future, its why and where at the time of leisure, every person in the difficult lack of direct results solved these questions in their own way
 yahi kaaran he ki vibhinn dharmik maton main hamako itnaa antar miltaa he, jo kabhi-kabhi vaimnasy or jhagade kaa rup le letaa he
 Not only are there differences in views of East and West, but each hemisphere has differences among its different views
 purv ke dharmon main, islam or hindu dharm main zaraa bhi anurupata nahin he
 In India itself, Buddhism and Jainism are very different from Brahmanism, in which opposing opinions like Arya Samaj and Sanatan Dharma are found
 puraane samay kaa ek swatantra vichaarak charvak he
 He challenged God in the old times itself
 har vyakti apane ko sahi maanata he
 It is unfortunate that instead of the old thinkers' experiences and ideas as the basis of the fight against ignorance in the future, we, like slackers, continue to shout the unwavering and unshakeable faith in the statement of what we have proved and The types are guilty of rooting the development of humanity
 sirf vishwaas or andh vishwaas khataranaak he
 It makes the brain dumb and human reactionary
 jo manushya apane ko yathartwaadee hone kaa daawa karata he, use samast pracheen rudhigat vishwaason ko chunauti deni hogi
 The prevailing opinion has to be tested on the basis of logic
 yadi ve tark kaa prahaar na sah sake, to tukade-tukade hokar gir padegaa
 Then to establish the new philosophy, to make them completely dashed, to clear the place and to reconstruct using some things of the old beliefs
 main pracheen vishwaason ke thospan par prashn karne ke sambandh main aashwast hum
 i firmly believe that a conscious supreme soul, who guides and guides the movement of nature, has no existence
 ham prakruti main vishwaas karte hai or samast pragatisheel aandolan kaa dhyey manushya dwaara apni seva ke liye prakruti par vijay praapt karnaa maanate hai
 There is no conscious power behind this direction
 yahi hamaara darshan he
 We want to ask the believers some questions
 yadi aapkaa vishwaas he ki ek sarvashaktimaan, sarvavyaapak or sarvagyani ishwar he, jisane vishwa kii rachana kii, to krupa karke mujhe yah bataayen ki usne yah rachana kyon kii? kashton or santapon se purna duniya – asankhya dukhon ke shaashvat anant gathbandhanon se grasit! ek bhi vyakti to puri tarah santrusht nahi he
 Please do not say that this is his rule
 yadi vah kisi niyam se bandhaa he to vah sarvashaktimaan nahin he
 He is also a slave to rules like us
 krupa karke yah bhi na kahen ki yah uskaa manoranjan he
 Nero had just lit a romp
 usne bahut thodi sankhya main logon kii hatya kii thi
 He caused very little sorrow for his complete entertainment
 or uskaa itihaas main kya sthaan he? use itihaaskaar kis naam se bulaate hai? sabhi vifaille visheshan us par barasaaye jate hai
 The pages are blackened by his blasphemous sentences, denouncing - Nero a heartless, merciless, wicked
 ek changez khan ne apane anand ke liye kuch hajaar jaane le leen or aaj ham uske naam se ghrinaa karte hai
 Then how do you justify your god? To the eternal Nero, who has been, and still continues to give, every day, every hour, and every minute, innumerable miseries
 phir tum kaise uske dushkarmon kaa paksh lene kii sochate ho, jo changez khan se prayek kshan adhik he? kya yah sab baad main in nirdosh ksht sahane waalon ko puraskaar or galati karne waalon ko dand dene ke liye ho rahaa he? thik he, thik he
 How long will you justify the person, who dares to inflict wounds on our body, because later, he will apply soft and comfortable ointments? gladator sanstha ke vyavasthaapak kahaan tak uchit karte the ki ek bhukhe khoonkhaar sher ke saamne manushya ko phenk do ki, yadi vah usase jaan bachaa letaa he, to uski khub dekhbhaal kii jaayegi? isaliye main poochta hum ki us chetan param aatma ne is vishwa or usamen manushyon kii rachana kyon kii? anand luutane ke liye? tab usamen or nero main kya fark he? You Muslims and Christians! You do not believe in past lives
 tum to hinduon kii tarah yah tark pesh nahin kar sakate ki pratyakshtah nirdosh vyaktiyon ke ksht unke purvajanmon ke karmon kaa fal he
 i ask you, why did that Almighty work for six days for the creation of the world by word? And why does he say every day that everything is fine? Call him today
 use pichhlaa itihaas dikhaao
 Let him study today's conditions
 ham dekhenge ki kya vah kehane kaa saahas karata he ki sab thik he
 From imprisonment to slums to slum settlements to millions of starving humans, to exploited laborers who are patiently watching bloodshed by capitalist vampires patiently and watching the waste of manpower that anyone sees Even the person, who has little knowledge, will tremble with fear, and instead of distributing more production to the needy people in the sea To throw it better, to the palaces of the kings whose foundations lay on the bones of human beings - let him see it all and then say - everything is fine! Why and from where? This is my question
 tum chup ho
 Okay, then i go ahead
 or tum hinduon, tum kehete ho ki aaj jo ksht bhoga rahe hai, ye purvajanm ke paapi hai or aaj ke utpeedak pichley janmon main sadhu purush the, atah ve satta kaa anand lut rahe hai
 i have to admit that your ancestors were very clever people
 unhone aise siddhanth gadhe, jinamein tark or avishvaas ke sabhi prayaason ko vifal karne kii kaafii takat he
 According to jurisprudence, punishment can be justified for only three reasons depending on the effect it has on the offender
 ve hai – pratikaar, bhay or sudhaar
 Today the theory of retaliation is condemned by all progressive thinkers
 bhaybheet karne ke siddhanth kaa bhi ant vahiin he
 The principle of reform is only necessary and is essential for the progress of humanity
 iskaa dhyey apradhi ko yogya or shantipriy naagarik ke rup main samaaj ko lautaanaa he
 But even if we consider human beings to be criminals, what is the nature of punishment given to them by God? You say that he produces them by making cows, cats, trees, herbs or animals
 tum aise 84 lakh dandon ko ginate ho
 i ask what effect he has on humans as reformers? How many people have you met who say that they were born as donkeys in a past life due to some sin? not even one? Do not give examples from your Puranas
 mere paas tumhaari puranic kathaon ke liye koi sthaan nahin he
 And then do you know that the biggest sin in the world is to be poor
 garibi ek abhishaap he
 This is a punishment
 main poochta hum ki dand prakriya kii kahaan tak prashansa karen, jo anivarytah manushya ko or adhik aparaadh karne ko baadhya kare? kya tumhaare ishwar ne yah nahin sochaa tha yaa usko bhi ye sari baaten maanavtaa dwaara akathaneey kashton ke jhelane kii keemat par anubhav se seekhni thim? tum kya sochate ho, kisi garib yaa anpadh parivaar, jaise ek chamaar yaa mehtar ke yahaan paidaa hone par insaan kaa kya bhagya hoga? chunki vah garib he, isaliye padhai nahin kar saktaa
 He remains despised and abandoned by his peers, who consider themselves elevated due to being born into an upper caste
 uskaa agyaan, uski garibi or usase kiya gaya vyavhaar uske hriday ko samaaj ke prati nishthur bana dete hai
 If he commits a sin, who will bear the consequences? Ishwar, he himself or the saint of society? And what about the punishments of those whom the arrogant Brahmins deliberately kept ignorant and who had to bear the punishment of having to bear a stream of melted lead in their ears because of listening to some sentences of your sacred books of knowledge - the Vedas? If they commit a crime, who will be responsible for it? And who will bear their blow? mere priy doston! ye siddhanth visheshadhikaar yukt logon ke avishkaar hai
 They justify their captured power, capital and highness on the basis of these principles
 aptaan singhlair ne likhaa tha ki manushya ko bas amartv main vishwaas dilaa do or uske baad uski sari sampatti lut lo
 He will help you in this task without raving
 dharm ke upadeshkon or satta ke swaamiyon ke gathbandhan se hi jail, faansee, kode or ye siddhanth upajte hai
 i ask, why doesn't your all-powerful God stop every person when he is committing a sin or a crime? He can do this very easily
 usne kyon nahin ladaaku raajaaon kii ladane kii ugrata ko samaapt kiya or is prakaar vishwayuddh dwaara maanavtaa par padane vaali vipattiyon se use bachaaya? usne angrejon ke mastishk main bharat ko mukt kar dene kii bhaavana kyon nahin paidaa kii? vah kyon nahin puunjipatiyon ke hriday main yah paropkaaree utsaah bhar detaa ki ve utpaadan ke sadhano par apana vyaktigat sampatti kaa adhikaar tyaag den or is prakaar keval sampoorn shramik samudaay, varan samast maanav samaaj ko poonjivadi bediyon se mukt karen? aap samaajwaad kii vyaavhaarikta par tark karnaa chaahate hai
 i leave it to your almighty to enforce it
 jahaan tak saamaanya bhalaai kii baat he, log samaajwaad ke gunon ko maanate hai
 They oppose it with an excuse of not being practical
 paramatma ko aane do or vah cheez ko sahi tareeke se kar de
 The British rule here is not because God wants but because he has power and we do not have the courage to oppose him
 ve hamako apane prabhutv main ishwar kii madad se nahin rakhe hai, balki banduukon, riflon, bam or goliyon, police or sena ke sahare
 It is our apathy that they are successfully committing the most disgraceful crime against society - complete exploitation of one nation by another
 kahaan he ishwar? kya vah manushya jati ke in kashton kaa mazaa le rahaa he? ek nero, ek changez, uskaa naash ho! Do you ask me how do i explain the origin of this world and the origin of man? Ok let me tell you
 chalrs darvin ne is vishay par kuch prakaash daalane kii koshish kii he
 Read it yah ek prakruti kii ghatana he
 Earth formed by accidental mixing of various substances, in the shape of a nebula
 kab? itihaas dekho
 Animals were born from this type of phenomenon and humans in a long period
 darwin kii ‘jeev kii utpatti’ padho
 And then all the development was done by man's constant opposition to nature and the desire to conquer it
 yah is ghatana kii sambhavtah sabase sookshm vyakhya he
 Your second argument could be why a child is born blind or lame? Is it not the result of the work done in his previous birth? Biologists have found a scientific solution to this problem
 avashya hi tum ek or bachakaana prashn puch sakate ho
 If there is no God, then why did people believe in him? My answer is subtle and clear
 jis prakaar ve preton or dusht atmaaon main vishwaas karne lage
 The only difference is that belief in God is universal and philosophy is highly developed
 isaki utpatti kaa shrey un shoshakon kii pratibha ko he, jo paramatma ke astitv kaa upadesh dekar logon ko apane prabhutv main rakhana chaahate the or unase apni vishisht sthiti kaa adhikaar evam anumodan chaahate the
 All religions, sects, sects and other such institutions eventually become the supporters of ruthless and exploitative institutions, individuals and classes
 raja ke viruddh har vidroh har dharm main sadaiv hi paap rahaa he
 After recognizing man's limitations, understanding his weaknesses and demerits, he is tempted to face bravely at the time of examination, to face all the dangers with masculinity and to tie his eruption into prosperity and majesty
 Fantasy existence was created
 apane vyaktigat niyamon or abhibhavakeey udaartaa se purna ishwar kii badha-chadha kar kalpana evam chithran kiya gaya
 He is used as a fear-monger when he discusses his rage and personal rules
 taaki koi manushya samaaj ke liye khatara na ban jaye
 When his guardian qualities are explained, he is used as a father, mother, brother, sister, friend and helper
 jab manushya apane sabhi doston dwaara vishwasghaat or tyaag dene se atyant klesh main ho, tab use is vichaar se santvana mil sakati he ki ek sadaa sachcha dost uski sahaayta karne ko he, usko sahaara degaa or vah sarvashaktimaan he or kuch bhi kar saktaa he
 In fact it was useful for the society in the primitive period
 pidaa main pade manushya ke liye ishwar kii kalpana upyogi hoti he
 Society has to fight against this belief
 manushya jab apane pairon par khadaa hone kaa prayaas karata he or yathartwaadee ban jaataa he, tab use shraddha ko ek ore phenk dena chahie or un sabhi kashton, pareshaaniyon kaa purushatv ke saath saamana karnaa chahie, jinamein paristhitiyaan use patake sakati hai
 This is my position today
 yah meraa ahankaar nahin he, mere dost! yah mere sochane kaa tarika he, jisane mujhe naastik banaaya he
 The comments ishwar main vishwaas or rose-ba-rose kii prarthana ko main manushya ke liye sabase swaarthee or gira hua kaam maanata hum
 i have read about the atheists who bravely faced all the calamities
 atah main bhi ek purush kii bhaanti faansee ke phande kii antim ghadi tak sir ooncha kiye khadaa rahanaa chahta hum
 We have to see how i manage
 mere ek dost ne mujhe prarthana karne ko kaha
 When i told him about being an atheist, he said, "in your last days you will start believing
" '’ maine kaha, ‘'nahin, pyaare dost, aisa nahin hoga
 i explain this to myself as degrading and corrupt
 swaarthee kaarnon se main prarthana nahin karuunga
 "readers and friends, is this arrogance?" If it is, i accept it
 aisa ho saktaa he ki yah keval apane vishwaas ke prati nyyochit garv ho or isko ghamand nahin kaha ja saktaa
 Boasting is an excess of undue pride towards oneself
 kya yah anuchit garv he, jo mujhe naastikta kii ore le gaya? athwa is vishay kaa khub saavdhaanee se adhyayan karne or us par khub vichaar karne ke baad maine ishwar par avishvaas kiya? i have completely failed to understand how unreasonable pride or boast can become an obstacle in a person's way of believing in God? i do not recognize the greatness of a truly great person - this can only happen when i too have received a little fame which i either do not deserve or i do not have the qualities that are necessary for it
 yahaan tak to samaj main aata he
 But how can it be that a person, who believes in God, suddenly stops believing in him because of his personal ego? Only two ways are possible
 yaa to manushya apane ko ishwar kaa pratidwandvi samajhane lage yaa vah swayan ko hi ishwar maananaa shuru kar de
 In both these situations he cannot become a true atheist
 pehali avasthaa main to vah apane pratidwandvi ke astitv ko nakaarta hi nahin he
 Even in the second stage, he assumes the existence of a consciousness that conducts all the activities of nature from behind the curtain
 main to us sarvashaktimaan param aatma ke astitv se hi inkaar karata hum
 It is not arrogance that motivated me to accept the doctrine of atheism
 main na to ek pratidwandvi hum, na hi ek avatar or na hi swayan paramatma
 To disprove this allegation, let us consider the facts
 mere in doston ke anusaar, dilli bam cese or lahore shadyantra cese ke dauraan mujhe jo anaavashyak yash mila, shaayad us kaaran main vruthabhimani ho gaya hum
 My atheism is not of recent origin
 maine to ishwar par vishwaas karnaa tab chhod diya tha, jab main ek aprasiddh noujvaan tha
 At least one college student cannot cultivate any undue ego that leads him to atheism
 yadhyapi main kuch adhyapakon kaa chaheta tha or kuch anya ko main acha nahin lagata tha
 But i have never been a hardworking or educated student
 ahankaar jaisi bhaavana main funsane kaa koi mauka hi na mil sakaa
 i was a very shy boy who had some pessimistic nature about the future
 mere baba, jinke prabhaav main main bada hua, ek roodhiwaadee arya samaji hai

 Entered school in Lahore and stayed in his hostel for a whole year
 vahaan subah or shaam kii prarthana ke atirikt main ghanton gayatri mantra japa karata tha
 i was a devotee in those days
 baad main maine apane pita ke saath rahanaa shuru kiya
 He is a liberal as far as religious orthodoxy is concerned
 unheen kii shiksha se mujhe swatantrata ke dhyey ke liye apane jivan ko samarpit karne kii prerana mili
 But they are not atheists
 unka ishwar main drudh vishwaas he
 They used to encourage me to pray and pray every day
 is prakaar se meraa paalan-poshan hua
 Entered the National College in the days of non-cooperation Movement
 yahaan aakar hi maine sari dharmik samasyaon– yahaan tak ki ishwar ke astitv ke bare main udaartaapurvak sochna, vichaarna or uski aalochana karnaa shuru kiya
 But i was still a firm believer
 us samay tak main apane lambe bal rakhata tha
 Although i could never believe in the mythology and principles of Sikhs or other religions
 kintu meri ishwar ke astitv main drudh nishtha thi
 Later i joined the revolutionary party
 vahaan jis pehle netaa se meraa sampark hua ve to pakkaa vishwaas na hote hue bhi ishwar ke astitv ko nakaarne kaa saahas hi nahin kar sakate the
 On my persistent inquiries about God, he would say, 'when you want, then do worship
 ' yah naastikta he, jisamen saahas kaa abhaav he
 The other leader, whom i came in contact with, is a firm devotee, respected comrade Shachindra Nath Sanyal, currently serving life imprisonment in connection with the Kakori Conspiracy Case
 unki pustak ‘bandi jivan’ ishwar kii mahima kaa jor-shor se gaan he
 They have showered him with flowers on God because of the mystic Vedanta
 28 janvari, 1925 ko puure bharat main jo ‘di revolutionari’ (krantikari) parchaa baanta gaya tha, vah unheen ke bauddhik shram kaa parinaam he
 It praises the Almighty and his actions and actions
 meraa ishwar ke prati avishvaas kaa bhav krantikari dal main bhi prasphutit nahin hua tha
 All the four martyrs of Kakori spent their last days in hymns and prayers
 ram prasad ‘bismil’ ek roodhiwaadee arya samaji the
 Despite his extensive studies in socialism and communism, Rajen Lahiri could not suppress his desire to pronounce the verses of the Upanishads and the Gita
 maine un sab main sirf ek hi vyakti ko dekha, jo kabhi prarthana nahin karata tha or kahata tha, ‘'darshan shaastra manushya kii durbalata athwa gyaan ke simit hone ke kaaran utpann hota he
 He is also serving a life-long banishment sentence
 parantu usne bhi ishwar ke astitv ko nakaarne kii kabhi himmat nahin kii
 By this time i was only a romantic idealist revolutionary
 ab tak ham dusron kaa anusaran karte the
 Now the time had come to take responsibility on his shoulders
 yah mere krantikari jivan kaa ek nirnaayak bindu tha
 The call of 'study' was echoing in the corridors of my mind - study to be able to face the arguments put forward by the opponents
 apane mat ke paksh main tark dene ke liye sakasham hone ke vaaste padho
 i started studying
 isse mere puraane vichaar or vishwaas adbhut rup se parishkrut hue
 Romance was replaced by serious ideas, no more mysticism, nor superstition
 yatharthwaad hamaara aadhaar bana
 i got a lot of opportunity to read about many ideals of world revolution
 maine araajaktaavaadi netaa bukanin ko padhaa, kuch samyawad ke pita marks ko, kintu adhik lenin, tratski, va anya logon ko padhaa, jo apane desh main safaltaapurvak kranti laaye the
 They were all atheists
 baad main mujhe niralamb swami kii pustak ‘sahaj gyaan’ mili
 It had mystic atheism
 1926 ke ant tak mujhe is baat kaa vishwaas ho gaya ki ek sarvashaktimaan param aatma kii baat, jisane brahmand kaa srijan, digdarshan or sanchaalan kiya, ek kori bakawaas he
 i showed my disbelief
 maine is vishay par apane doston se bahes kii
 i was a declared atheist
 may 1927 main main lahore main giraftaar hua
 i had to spend a month in the railway police lockup
 police afasaron ne mujhe bataaya ki main lakhanu main tha, jab vahaan kakori dal kaa mukadmaa chal rahaa tha, ki maine unhen chhudaane kii kisi yojana par baat kii thi, ki unki sahmati paane ke baad hamane kuch bam praapt kiye the, ki 1927 main dashahra ke avasar par un bamon main se ek pareekshan ke liye bheed par phenkaa gaya, ki yadi main krantikari dal kii gatividhiyon par prakaash daalane vaala ek vaktavy de duun, to mujhe giraftaar nahin kiya jaayegaa or iske vipareet mujhe adaalat main mubir kii tarah pesh kiye bagaiyr reeha kar diya jaayegaa or inaam diya jaayegaa
 i laughed at the proposal
 yah sab bekaar kii baat thi

 Neuman said that if i did not make such a statement, i would be forced to prosecute for conspiracy to wage a rebellion related to the Kakori case and for brutal murders in the Dussehra nuisance and that i would have the punishment and execution to hang me There is proper evidence for usee din se kuch police afasaron ne mujhe niyam se donon samay ishwar kii stuti karne ke liye phuslaana shuru kiya
 But now i was an atheist
 main swayan ke liye yah baat tay karnaa chahta tha ki kya shaanti or anand ke dinon main hi main naastik hone kaa dambh bharta hum yaa aise kathin samay main bhi main un siddhanton par adig rah saktaa hum
 After much thought, i decided that i could not believe and pray to God in any way
 nahin, maine ek kshan ke liye bhi nahin kii
 This was the real test and i was successful
 ab main ek pakkaa avishvasi tha or tab se lagaataar hum
 Passing this test was not an easy task
 ‘vishwaas’ kashton ko halakaa kar detaa he
 You can even make them pleasantly
 ishwar main manushya ko atyadhik santvana dene vaala ek aadhaar mil saktaa he
 Without that a man has to depend on himself
 toofaan or jhanjhaavat ke bich apane paanvon par khadaa rahanaa koi bacchon kaa khel nahin he
 If there is arrogance in these watches of examination, then steam evaporates and a man is not able to dare to reject his faith
 yadi aisa karata he, to isse yah nishkarsh nikalataa he ki uske paas sirf ahankaar nahin varan koi anya shakti he
 Today is exactly the same situation
 nirnay kaa puraa-puraa pataa he
 Within a week it will be announced that i am going to give up my life on one goal
 is vichaar ke atirikt or kya santvana ho sakati he? a Hindu who believes in God can hope to be a king on rebirth
 ek musalmaan yaa isai swarg main vyaapt samruddhi ke anand kii or apane kashton or balidaan ke liye puraskaar kii kalpana kar saktaa he
 But what can i expect? i know that the moment the loop of the rope falls on my neck and the bottom of my foot falls, it will be a complete stop - that will be the last moment
 main yaa meri aatma sab vahiin samaapt ho jaayegi
 Nothing will be ahead
 ek choti si juujhati hui zindagi, jisaki koi aisi gauravshaalee parinti nahin he, apane main swayan ek puraskaar hogi– yadi mujhamen is drushti se dekhne kaa saahas ho
 Without any selfishness here or without a desire for rewards here and there, i have surrendered my life to the goal of freedom, because i could not do anything else
 jis din hamen is manovriti ke bahut-se purush or mahilaayein mil jaayenge, jo apane jivan ko manushya kii seva or peedit maanavtaa ke uddhaar ke atirikt kahin samarpit kar hi nahin sakate, usee din mukti ke yug kaa shubharambh hoga
 They will be motivated to challenge exploiters, oppressors and oppressors
 is liye nahin ki unhen raja bananaa he yaa koi anya puraskaar praapt karnaa he yahaan yaa agle janm main yaa mrityoparant swarg main
 They will have to adopt this path to take the slavery gamble from the neck of humanity and establish liberation and peace
 kya ve us raste par chalenge jo unke apane liye khataranaak kintu unki mahaan aatma ke liye ek maatr kalpaneey rasta he
 Will his pride be misinterpreted as arrogance towards this noble cause? Who would dare to speak such a disgusting adjective? Either he is stupid or sly
 hamen chahie ki use kshamaa kar den, kyonki vah us hriday main udwelit ucch vichaaron, bhaawanaaon, aavegon or unki gaharaai ko mahasoos nahin kar saktaa
 His heart is dead like a piece of flesh
 uski ankhon par anya swaarthon ke preton kii chaaya padane se ve kamazor ho gayi hai
 The virtue of trusting oneself can always be termed as ego
 yah dukhapurna or kshtprad he, par chaara hi kya he? Criticism and free thought are both essential qualities of a revolutionary
 kyonki hamaare purvajon ne kisi param aatma ke prati vishwaas bana liya tha
 Therefore, any person who challenges that faith to the truth or the existence of that supreme soul will be called heretical, treacherous
 yadi uske tark itane akatya hai ki unka khandan vitark dwaara nahin ho saktaa or uski aasthaa itani prabal he ki use ishwar ke prakope se hone vaali vipattiyon kaa bhay dikhaa kar dabaaya nahin ja saktaa to uski yah kah kar ninda kii jaayegi ki vah vruthabhimani he
 It was not my ego that led me to atheism
 mere tark kaa tarika santoshprad siddh hota he yaa nahin iskaa nirnay mere pathakon ko karnaa he, mujhe nahin
 i know that faith in God would have made my life easier and my burden lighter today
 us par mere avishvaas ne saare vaataavaran ko atyant shushk bana diya he
 a little mysticism can make it poetic
 kintu mere bhagya ko kisi unmaad kaa sahaara nahin chahie
 i am realistic
 main antah prakruti par vivek kii sahaayta se vijay chahta hum
 i have not always succeeded in this cause
 prayaas karnaa manushya kaa kartavya he
 Success depends on coincidence and environment
 koi bhi manushya, jisamen tanik bhi vivek shakti he, vah apane vaataavaran ko taarkik rup se samajhnaa chahega
 Where there is no direct evidence, philosophy is important
 jab hamaare purvajon ne fursat ke samay vishwa ke rahasy ko, iske bhoot, vartmaan evam bhavishya ko, iske kyon or kahaan se ko samajhane kaa prayaas kiya to sidhe parinaamon ke kathin abhaav main har vyakti ne in prashnon ko apane bhang se hal kiya
 This is the reason why we find such a difference in different religious views, which sometimes takes the form of disharmony and quarrels
 na keval purv or pashchim ke darshanon main matbhed he, balki prayek golardh ke apane vibhinn maton main aapas main antar he
 In the earlier religions, there is no conformity between Islam and Hinduism
 bharat main hi buddha or jain dharm us brahmanwad se bahut alag he, jisamen swayan aryasamaj va sanathan dharm jaise virdohi mat paye jate hai
 Charwak is an old-time independent thinker
 usne ishwar ko puraane samay main hi chunauti di thi
 Everyone believes himself to be right
 durbhaagya kii baat he ki bajaay puraane vichaarkon ke anubhavon or vichaaron ko bhavishya main agyanta ke viruddh ladaai kaa aadhaar banane ke ham aalasiyon kii tarah, jo ham siddh ho chuke hai, unke kathan main avichal evam sanshayheen vishwaas kii cheekh pukaar karte rahete hai or is prakaar maanavtaa ke vikaas ko jad banane ke doshi hai
 Only faith and blind faith are dangerous
 yah mastishk ko mudh or manushya ko pratikriyaavaadi bana detaa he
 a man who claims to be realistic must challenge all ancient orthodox beliefs
 prachlit maton ko tark kii kasuti par kasnaa hoga
 If they could not bear the brunt of the argument, they would fall to pieces
 tab naye darshan kii sthapana ke liye unako puraa dharashayi karke jagah saaf karnaa or puraane vishwaason kii kuch baton kaa prayog karke punarniman karnaa
 i am confident about questioning the constancy of ancient beliefs
 mujhe puraa vishwaas he ki ek chetan param aatma kaa, jo prakruti kii gati kaa digdarshan evam sanchaalan karata he, koi astitv nahin he
 We believe in nature and the aim of the entire progressive movement is for man to conquer nature for his service
 isko disha dene ke peeche koi chetan shakti nahin he
 This is our philosophy
 ham aastikon se kuch prashn karnaa chaahate hai
 If you believe that there is an omnipotent, omniscient and omniscient God who created the world, then please tell me why he created it
 a world full of sorrows and sorrows - afflicted by eternal eternal alliances of innumerable sufferings! Not a single person is completely saturated
 kripaya yah na kahen ki yahi uskaa niyam he
 If he is bound by a rule he is not omnipotent
 vah bhi hamaari hi tarah niyamon kaa das he
 Please do not even say that this is his entertainment
 nero ne bas ek rome jalaayaa tha
 He killed a small number of people
 usne to bahut thodaa dukh paidaa kiya, apane purna manoranjan ke liye
 And what is its place in history? By what name are historians called him? All the poisonous adjectives are showered on him
 panne uski ninda ke vaakyon se kaale pute hai, bhartsana karte hai – nero ek hridayaheen, nirdayee, dusht
 a Genghis Khan took a few thousand lives for his joy and today we hate his name
 tab kis prakaar tum apane ishwar ko nyyochit tehraate ho? us shaashvat nero ko, jo har din, har ghante ore har minute asankhya dukh detaa rahaa, or abhi bhi de rahaa he
 Then how do you think of taking the side of his misdeeds, which is more every moment than Genghis Khan? Is all this happening later to reward these innocent victims and punish those who commit mistakes? OK OK
 tum kab tak us vyakti ko uchit tehraate rahoge, jo hamaare sharir par ghaav karne kaa saahas isaliye karata he ki baad main mulaayam or aaramdaayak malaham lagaayegaa? To what extent did the administrators of the Gladiator organization justify throwing a man in front of a hungry bloodless lion, that if he saves his life, he will be looked after? That is why i ask why that conscious supreme soul created this world and humans in it? To rob you of joy? Then what is the difference between him and Nero? tum musalamaanon or isaayiyon! tum to purvajanm main vishwaas nahin karte
 You, like Hindus, cannot argue that the suffering of innocent people is the result of the deeds of their past lives
 main tumse poochta hum ki us sarvashaktishaalee ne shabd dwaara vishwa ke utpatti ke liye chah din tak kyon parishram kiya? or prayek din vah kyon kahata he ki sab thik he? bulaao use aaj
 Show him past history
 use aaj kii paristhitiyon kaa adhyayan karne do
 We will see if he dares to say that all is well
 karawas kii kaal-kothriyon se lekar jhopadiyon kii bastiyon tak bhukh se tadapate lakhon insaanon se lekar un shoshit mazaduron se lekar jo poonjivadi pishaach dwaara khun chusane kii kriya ko dhairyapurvak nirutsaah se dekh rahe hai or us maanavshakti kii barbaadi dekh rahe hai, jise dekhakar koi bhi vyakti, jise tanik bhi sahaj gyaan he, bhay se sihar uthegaa, or adhik utpaadan ko zaruratmand logon main baantne ke bajaay samudr main phenk dena behatar samajhane se lekar raajaaon ke un mehalon tak jinaki neenv maanav kii haddiyon par padi he- usko yah sab dekhne do or phir kahe – sab kuch thik he! kyon or kahaan se? yahi meraa prashn he
 You are silent thik he, to main aage chalata hum
 And you Hindus, you say that those who are suffering today, they are sinners of previous lives and today's tyrants were saintly men in past lives, so they are robbing the joy of power
 mujhe yah maananaa padataa he ki aapke purvaj bahut chaalaak vyakti the
 He created theories that have the power to thwart all attempts of reason and mistrust
 nyaayashastra ke anusaar dand ko apradhi par padane vaale asar ke aadhaar par keval teen kaarnon se uchit tehraaya ja saktaa he
 They are retaliation, fear and correction
 aaj sabhi pragatisheel vichaarkon dwaara pratikaar ke siddhanth kii ninda kii jaati he
 The end of the principle of fear is also there
 sudhaar karne kaa siddhanth hi keval aavashyak he or maanavtaa kii pragati ke liye anivaary he
 Its mission is to return the offender to society as a qualified and peaceful citizen
 kintu yadi ham manushyon ko apradhi maan bhi len, to ishwar dwaara unhen diye gayi dand kii kya prakruti he? tum kehete ho vah unhen gaay, billi, ped, jadi-booti yaa jaanavar banaakar paidaa karata he
 You count 84 lakh such punishments
 main poochta hum ki manushya par inkaa sudhaarak ke rup main kya asar he? tum aise kitne vyaktiyon se mili ho, jo yah kehete hai ki ve kisi paap ke kaaran purvajanm main gadhaa ke rup main paidaa hue the? ek bhi nahin? apane puraanon se udhaaharan na do
 i have no place for your mythology
 or phir kya tumhen pataa he ki duniya main sabase bada paap garib hona he
 Poverty is a curse
 yah ek dand he
 To what extent should i praise the punishment process, which inevitably compels a man to commit more crimes? Did not your God think this or did he have to learn all these things from the experience of humanity at the cost of suffering inexplicable sufferings? What do you think, what will be the fate of a human being when a poor or illiterate family, like a chamar or a scavenger is born here? Since he is poor, he cannot study
 vah apane saathiyon se tiraskrit evam parityakt rahata he, jo oonchi jati main paidaa hone ke kaaran apane ko ooncha samajhate hai
 His ignorance, his poverty and his treatment make his heart callous to society
 yadi vah koi paap karata he to uskaa fal koun bhogega? ishvar, vah swayan yaa samaaj ke manishi? or un logon ke dand ke bare main kya hoga, jinhen dambhi brahmanon ne jaanboojh kar agyani banaaye rakhaa or jinako tumhaari gyaan kii pavitra pustakon – vedon ke kuch vaakya sun lene ke kaaran kaan main pighale sise kii dhara sahan karne kii sajaa bhugatni padati thi? yadi ve koi aparaadh karte hai, to uske liye koun zimmedaar hoga? or unka prahaar koun sahegaa? My dear friends These principles are inventions of privileged people
 ye apni hathiyaan hui shakti, puunji or ucchata ko in siddhanton ke aadhaar par sahi tehraate hai
 Uptan Sinclair wrote that just make a man believe in immortality and then rob all his property
 vah bagaiyr badbadaaye is kaary main tumhaari sahaayta karegaa
 Prisons, hangings, whips and these doctrines arise only from the alliance of preachers of religion and the masters of power
 main poochta hum tumhaara sarvashaktishaalee ishwar har vyakti ko kyon nahin us samay roktaa he jab vah koi paap yaa aparaadh kar rahaa hota he? yah to vah bahut aasaani se kar saktaa he
 Why didn't he end the fighting rage of the fighting kings and thus save him from the plagues of humanity by the world war? Why did he not evoke the feeling of liberating India in the British mind? Why wouldn't it fill the benevolent zeal in the hearts of the capitalists to relinquish their right to personal property over the means of production and thus only liberate the entire working community, but the entire human society, from the capitalist fetters? You want to argue the practicality of socialism
 main ise aapke sarvashaktimaan par chhod detaa hum ki vah lagu kare
 As far as general good is concerned, people regard the virtues of socialism
 ve iske vyaavhaarik na hone kaa bahaanaa lekar iskaa virodh karte hai
 Let the divine come and do that thing in the right way
 angrejon kii hukumat yahaan isaliye nahin he ki ishwar chahta he balki isaliye ki unke paas takat he or hamamen unka virodh karne kii himmat nahin
 They have not placed us in their dominion with the help of God, but with the help of guns, rifles, bombs and bullets, police and army
 yah hamaari udaseenta he ki ve samaaj ke viruddh sabase nindaneey aparaadh – ek raashtra kaa duusare raashtra dwaara atyaachaar purna shoshan – safaltaapurvak kar rahe hai
 Where is God? Is he enjoying these sufferings of mankind? One Nero, one Genghis, perish! kya tum mujhase poochhate ho ki main is vishwa kii utpatti or maanav kii utpatti kii vyakhya kaise karata hum? thik he, main tumhen bataata hum
 Charles Darwin has tried to throw some light on the subject
 use padho
 It is a phenomenon of nature
 vibhinn padaarthon ke, niharika ke aakaar main, aakasmik mishran se prithvi bani
 When? Look at the history
 isi prakaar kii ghatana se jantu paidaa hue or ek lambe daur main maanav
 Read Darwin's 'origin of Fauna'
 or taduparant sara vikaas manushya dwaara prakruti ke lagaataar virodh or us par vijay praapt karne kii cheshtaa se hua
 This is probably the most nuanced explanation of this incident
 tumhaara doosraa tark yah ho saktaa he ki kyon ek baccha andhaa yaa langadaa paidaa hota he? kya yah uske purvajanm main kiye gayi kaaryon kaa fal nahin he? jeevigyaan vettaon ne is samasya kaa vaigyanik samaadhaan nikaal liya he
 Of course you can ask another childish question
 yadi ishwar nahin he, to log usamen vishwaas kyon karne lage? meraa uttar sookshm or spasht he
 Just as they started believing in phantoms and evil spirits
 antar keval itnaa he ki ishwar main vishwaas vishwavyaapee he or darshan atyant viksit
 Its genesis is attributed to the genius of the exploiters, who preached the existence of God and wanted to keep the people in their dominion and asked for the right and approval of their specific position
 sabhi dharm, sampradaay, panth or aisi anya sansthaaen ant main nirdayee or shoshak sansthaaon, vyaktiyon or virgon kii samarthak ho jaati hai
 Every rebellion against the king has always been a sin in every religion
 manushya kii simaaon ko pahchaanane par, uski durbalata va dosha ko samajhane ke baad pariksha kii ghadiyon main manushya ko bahaduree se saamana karne ke liye utsahit karne, sabhi khataron ko purushatv ke saath jhelane or sampannataa evam aishwarya main uske visphot ko baandhne ke liye ishwar ke kaalpanik astitv kii rachana hui
 The full God was conceived and depicted by his personal rules and parental generosity
 jab uski ugrata or vyaktigat niyamon kii charchaa hoti he, to uskaa upyog ek bhay dikhaane vaale ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 So that no man becomes a threat to society
 jab uske abhibhavak gunon kii vyakhya hoti he, to uskaa upyog ek pita, mata, bhai, bahan, dost or sahaayak kii tarah kiya jaataa he
 When a man is in great distress at betrayal and abandonment by all his friends, he can be comforted by the idea that a true friend is always there to help him, support him and he is almighty and can do anything
 vastav main aadim kaal main yah samaaj ke liye upyogi tha
 Imagination of God is useful for a person suffering
 samaaj ko is vishwaas ke viruddh ladanaa hoga
 When a man tries to stand on his feet and becomes realistic, then he should throw reverence aside and face all the sufferings, troubles in manhood in which circumstances may strike him
 yahi aaj meri sthiti he
 This is not my ego, my friend! This is my way of thinking, which has made me an atheist
 tippaniyan i consider faith in God and daily prayer to be the most selfish and fallen work for man
 maine un naastikon ke bare main padhaa he, jinhone sabhi vipadaaon kaa bahaduree se saamana kiya
 Therefore, i also want to stand with my head raised till the last moment of the hanging loop like a man
 hamen dekhnaa he ki main kaise nibhaa paata hum
 a friend of mine asked me to pray
 jab maine use naastik hone kii baat bataayi to usne kaha, ‘'apane antim dinon main tum vishwaas karne lagoge
 "I said," No, dear friend, that will not happen
 main ise apane liye apmanjanak or bhrasht hone kii baat samajhaata hum
 i will not pray for selfish reasons
 '’ pathakon or doston, kya yah ahankaar he? agar he to main sweekaar karata hum
 i have completely failed to understand how unreasonable pride or boast can become an obstacle in a person's way of believing in God? i do not recognize the greatness of a truly great person - this can only happen when i too have received a little fame which i either do not deserve or i do not have the qualities that are necessary for it
 yahaan tak to samaj main aata he
 But how can it be that a person, who believes in God, suddenly stops believing in him because of his personal ego? Only two ways are possible
 yaa to manushya apane ko ishwar kaa pratidwandvi samajhane lage yaa vah swayan ko hi ishwar maananaa shuru kar de
 In both these situations he cannot become a true atheist
 pehali avasthaa main to vah apane pratidwandvi ke astitv ko nakaarta hi nahin he
 Even in the second stage, he assumes the existence of a consciousness that conducts all the activities of nature from behind the curtain
 main to us sarvashaktimaan param aatma ke astitv se hi inkaar karata hum
 It is not arrogance that motivated me to accept the doctrine of atheism
 main na to ek pratidwandvi hum, na hi ek avatar or na hi swayan paramatma
 To disprove this allegation, let us consider the facts
 mere in doston ke anusaar, dilli bam cese or lahore shadyantra cese ke dauraan mujhe jo anaavashyak yash mila, shaayad us kaaran main vruthabhimani ho gaya hum
 My atheism is not of recent origin
 maine to ishwar par vishwaas karnaa tab chhod diya tha, jab main ek aprasiddh noujvaan tha
 At least one college student cannot cultivate any undue ego that leads him to atheism
 yadhyapi main kuch adhyapakon kaa chaheta tha or kuch anya ko main acha nahin lagata tha
 But i have never been a hardworking or educated student
 ahankaar jaisi bhaavana main funsane kaa koi mauka hi na mil sakaa
 i was a very shy boy who had some pessimistic nature about the future
 mere baba, jinke prabhaav main main bada hua, ek roodhiwaadee arya samaji hai
 An Arya Samaj is anything but an atheist
 apni praathmik shiksha puri karne ke baad maine di
 a
 ve
 Entered school in Lahore and stayed in his hostel for a whole year
 vahaan subah or shaam kii prarthana ke atirikt main ghanton gayatri mantra japa karata tha
 i was a devotee in those days
 baad main maine apane pita ke saath rahanaa shuru kiya
 He is a liberal as far as religious orthodoxy is concerned
 unheen kii shiksha se mujhe swatantrata ke dhyey ke liye apane jivan ko samarpit karne kii prerana mili
 But they are not atheists
 unka ishwar main drudh vishwaas he
 They used to encourage me to pray and pray every day
 is prakaar se meraa paalan-poshan hua
 Entered the National College in the days of non-cooperation Movement
 yahaan aakar hi maine sari dharmik samasyaon– yahaan tak ki ishwar ke astitv ke bare main udaartaapurvak sochna, vichaarna or uski aalochana karnaa shuru kiya
 But i was still a firm believer
 us samay tak main apane lambe bal rakhata tha
 Although i could never believe in the mythology and principles of Sikhs or other religions
 kintu meri ishwar ke astitv main drudh nishtha thi
 Later i joined the revolutionary party
 vahaan jis pehle netaa se meraa sampark hua ve to pakkaa vishwaas na hote hue bhi ishwar ke astitv ko nakaarne kaa saahas hi nahin kar sakate the
 On my persistent inquiries about God, he would say, 'when you want, then do worship
 ' yah naastikta he, jisamen saahas kaa abhaav he
 The other leader, whom i came in contact with, is a firm devotee, respected comrade Shachindra Nath Sanyal, currently serving life imprisonment in connection with the Kakori Conspiracy Case
 unki pustak ‘bandi jivan’ ishwar kii mahima kaa jor-shor se gaan he
 They have showered him with flowers on God because of the mystic Vedanta
 28 janvari, 1925 ko puure bharat main jo ‘di revolutionari’ (krantikari) parchaa baanta gaya tha, vah unheen ke bauddhik shram kaa parinaam he
 It praises the Almighty and his actions and actions
 meraa ishwar ke prati avishvaas kaa bhav krantikari dal main bhi prasphutit nahin hua tha
 All the four martyrs of Kakori spent their last days in hymns and prayers
 ram prasad ‘bismil’ ek roodhiwaadee arya samaji the
 Despite his extensive studies in socialism and communism, Rajen Lahiri could not suppress his desire to pronounce the verses of the Upanishads and the Gita
 maine un sab main sirf ek hi vyakti ko dekha, jo kabhi prarthana nahin karata tha or kahata tha, ‘'darshan shaastra manushya kii durbalata athwa gyaan ke simit hone ke kaaran utpann hota he
 He is also serving a life-long banishment sentence
 parantu usne bhi ishwar ke astitv ko nakaarne kii kabhi himmat nahin kii
 By this time i was only a romantic idealist revolutionary
 ab tak ham dusron kaa anusaran karte the
 Now the time had come to take responsibility on his shoulders
 yah mere krantikari jivan kaa ek nirnaayak bindu tha
 The call of 'study' was echoing in the corridors of my mind - study to be able to face the arguments put forward by the opponents
 apane mat ke paksh main tark dene ke liye sakasham hone ke vaaste padho
 i started studying
 isse mere puraane vichaar or vishwaas adbhut rup se parishkrut hue
 Romance was replaced by serious ideas, no more mysticism, nor superstition
 yatharthwaad hamaara aadhaar bana
 i got a lot of opportunity to read about many ideals of world revolution
 maine araajaktaavaadi netaa bukanin ko padhaa, kuch samyawad ke pita marks ko, kintu adhik lenin, tratski, va anya logon ko padhaa, jo apane desh main safaltaapurvak kranti laaye the
 They were all atheists
 baad main mujhe niralamb swami kii pustak ‘sahaj gyaan’ mili
 It had mystic atheism
 1926 ke ant tak mujhe is baat kaa vishwaas ho gaya ki ek sarvashaktimaan param aatma kii baat, jisane brahmand kaa srijan, digdarshan or sanchaalan kiya, ek kori bakawaas he
 i showed my disbelief
 maine is vishay par apane doston se bahes kii
 i was a declared atheist
 may 1927 main main lahore main giraftaar hua
 i had to spend a month in the railway police lockup
 police afasaron ne mujhe bataaya ki main lakhanu main tha, jab vahaan kakori dal kaa mukadmaa chal rahaa tha, ki maine unhen chhudaane kii kisi yojana par baat kii thi, ki unki sahmati paane ke baad hamane kuch bam praapt kiye the, ki 1927 main dashahra ke avasar par un bamon main se ek pareekshan ke liye bheed par phenkaa gaya, ki yadi main krantikari dal kii gatividhiyon par prakaash daalane vaala ek vaktavy de duun, to mujhe giraftaar nahin kiya jaayegaa or iske vipareet mujhe adaalat main mubir kii tarah pesh kiye bagaiyr reeha kar diya jaayegaa or inaam diya jaayegaa
 i laughed at the proposal
 yah sab bekaar kii baat thi
 We, like people, do not throw bombs on our innocent people
 ek din subah si
 I
 di
 Senior Superintendent of India Mr
 Neuman said that if i did not make such a statement, i would be forced to prosecute for conspiracy to wage a rebellion related to the Kakori case and for brutal murders in the Dussehra nuisance and that i would have the punishment and execution to hang me There is proper evidence for usee din se kuch police afasaron ne mujhe niyam se donon samay ishwar kii stuti karne ke liye phuslaana shuru kiya
 But now i was an atheist
 main swayan ke liye yah baat tay karnaa chahta tha ki kya shaanti or anand ke dinon main hi main naastik hone kaa dambh bharta hum yaa aise kathin samay main bhi main un siddhanton par adig rah saktaa hum
 After much thought, i decided that i could not believe and pray to God in any way
 nahin, maine ek kshan ke liye bhi nahin kii
 This was the real test and i was successful
 ab main ek pakkaa avishvasi tha or tab se lagaataar hum
 Passing this test was not an easy task
 ‘vishwaas’ kashton ko halakaa kar detaa he
 You can even make them pleasantly
 ishwar main manushya ko atyadhik santvana dene vaala ek aadhaar mil saktaa he
 Without that a man has to depend on himself
 toofaan or jhanjhaavat ke bich apane paanvon par khadaa rahanaa koi bacchon kaa khel nahin he
 If there is arrogance in these watches of examination, then steam evaporates and a man is not able to dare to reject his faith
 yadi aisa karata he, to isse yah nishkarsh nikalataa he ki uske paas sirf ahankaar nahin varan koi anya shakti he
 Today is exactly the same situation
 nirnay kaa puraa-puraa pataa he
 Within a week it will be announced that i am going to give up my life on one goal
 is vichaar ke atirikt or kya santvana ho sakati he? a Hindu who believes in God can hope to be a king on rebirth
 ek musalmaan yaa isai swarg main vyaapt samruddhi ke anand kii or apane kashton or balidaan ke liye puraskaar kii kalpana kar saktaa he
 But what can i expect? i know that the moment the loop of the rope falls on my neck and the bottom of my foot falls, it will be a complete stop - that will be the last moment
 main yaa meri aatma sab vahiin samaapt ho jaayegi
 Nothing will be ahead
 ek choti si juujhati hui zindagi, jisaki koi aisi gauravshaalee parinti nahin he, apane main swayan ek puraskaar hogi– yadi mujhamen is drushti se dekhne kaa saahas ho
 Without any selfishness here or without a desire for rewards here and there, i have surrendered my life to the goal of freedom, because i could not do anything else
 jis din hamen is manovriti ke bahut-se purush or mahilaayein mil jaayenge, jo apane jivan ko manushya kii seva or peedit maanavtaa ke uddhaar ke atirikt kahin samarpit kar hi nahin sakate, usee din mukti ke yug kaa shubharambh hoga
 They will be motivated to challenge exploiters, oppressors and oppressors
 is liye nahin ki unhen raja bananaa he yaa koi anya puraskaar praapt karnaa he yahaan yaa agle janm main yaa mrityoparant swarg main
 They will have to adopt this path to take the slavery gamble from the neck of humanity and establish liberation and peace
 kya ve us raste par chalenge jo unke apane liye khataranaak kintu unki mahaan aatma ke liye ek maatr kalpaneey rasta he
 Will his pride be misinterpreted as arrogance towards this noble cause? Who would dare to speak such a disgusting adjective? Either he is stupid or sly
 hamen chahie ki use kshamaa kar den, kyonki vah us hriday main udwelit ucch vichaaron, bhaawanaaon, aavegon or unki gaharaai ko mahasoos nahin kar saktaa
 His heart is dead like a piece of flesh
 uski ankhon par anya swaarthon ke preton kii chaaya padane se ve kamazor ho gayi hai
 The virtue of trusting oneself can always be termed as ego
 yah dukhapurna or kshtprad he, par chaara hi kya he? Criticism and free thought are both essential qualities of a revolutionary
 kyonki hamaare purvajon ne kisi param aatma ke prati vishwaas bana liya tha
 Therefore, any person who challenges that faith to the truth or the existence of that supreme soul will be called heretical, treacherous
 yadi uske tark itane akatya hai ki unka khandan vitark dwaara nahin ho saktaa or uski aasthaa itani prabal he ki use ishwar ke prakope se hone vaali vipattiyon kaa bhay dikhaa kar dabaaya nahin ja saktaa to uski yah kah kar ninda kii jaayegi ki vah vruthabhimani he
 It was not my ego that led me to atheism
 mere tark kaa tarika santoshprad siddh hota he yaa nahin iskaa nirnay mere pathakon ko karnaa he, mujhe nahin
 i know that faith in God would have made my life easier and my burden lighter today
 us par mere avishvaas ne saare vaataavaran ko atyant shushk bana diya he
 a little mysticism can make it poetic
 kintu mere bhagya ko kisi unmaad kaa sahaara nahin chahie
 i am realistic
 main antah prakruti par vivek kii sahaayta se vijay chahta hum
 i have not always succeeded in this cause
 prayaas karnaa manushya kaa kartavya he
 Success depends on coincidence and environment
 koi bhi manushya, jisamen tanik bhi vivek shakti he, vah apane vaataavaran ko taarkik rup se samajhnaa chahega
 Where there is no direct evidence, philosophy is important
 jab hamaare purvajon ne fursat ke samay vishwa ke rahasy ko, iske bhoot, vartmaan evam bhavishya ko, iske kyon or kahaan se ko samajhane kaa prayaas kiya to sidhe parinaamon ke kathin abhaav main har vyakti ne in prashnon ko apane bhang se hal kiya
 This is the reason why we find such a difference in different religious views, which sometimes takes the form of disharmony and quarrels
 na keval purv or pashchim ke darshanon main matbhed he, balki prayek golardh ke apane vibhinn maton main aapas main antar he
 In the earlier religions, there is no conformity between Islam and Hinduism
 bharat main hi buddha or jain dharm us brahmanwad se bahut alag he, jisamen swayan aryasamaj va sanathan dharm jaise virdohi mat paye jate hai
 Charwak is an old-time independent thinker
 usne ishwar ko puraane samay main hi chunauti di thi
 Everyone believes himself to be right
 durbhaagya kii baat he ki bajaay puraane vichaarkon ke anubhavon or vichaaron ko bhavishya main agyanta ke viruddh ladaai kaa aadhaar banane ke ham aalasiyon kii tarah, jo ham siddh ho chuke hai, unke kathan main avichal evam sanshayheen vishwaas kii cheekh pukaar karte rahete hai or is prakaar maanavtaa ke vikaas ko jad banane ke doshi hai
 Only faith and blind faith are dangerous
 yah mastishk ko mudh or manushya ko pratikriyaavaadi bana detaa he
 a man who claims to be realistic must challenge all ancient orthodox beliefs
 prachlit maton ko tark kii kasuti par kasnaa hoga
 If they could not bear the brunt of the argument, they would fall to pieces
 tab naye darshan kii sthapana ke liye unako puraa dharashayi karke jagah saaf karnaa or puraane vishwaason kii kuch baton kaa prayog karke punarniman karnaa
 i am confident about questioning the constancy of ancient beliefs
 mujhe puraa vishwaas he ki ek chetan param aatma kaa, jo prakruti kii gati kaa digdarshan evam sanchaalan karata he, koi astitv nahin he
 We believe in nature and the aim of the entire progressive movement is for man to conquer nature for his service
 isko disha dene ke peeche koi chetan shakti nahin he
 This is our philosophy
 ham aastikon se kuch prashn karnaa chaahate hai
 If you believe that there is an omnipotent, omniscient and omniscient God who created the world, then please tell me why he created it
 a world full of sorrows and sorrows - afflicted by eternal eternal alliances of innumerable sufferings! Not a single person is completely saturated
 kripaya yah na kahen ki yahi uskaa niyam he
 If he is bound by a rule he is not omnipotent
 vah bhi hamaari hi tarah niyamon kaa das he
 Please do not even say that this is his entertainment
 nero ne bas ek rome jalaayaa tha
 He killed a small number of people
 usne to bahut thodaa dukh paidaa kiya, apane purna manoranjan ke liye
 And what is its place in history? By what name are historians called him? All the poisonous adjectives are showered on him
 panne uski ninda ke vaakyon se kaale pute hai, bhartsana karte hai – nero ek hridayaheen, nirdayee, dusht
 a Genghis Khan took a few thousand lives for his joy and today we hate his name
 tab kis prakaar tum apane ishwar ko nyyochit tehraate ho? us shaashvat nero ko, jo har din, har ghante ore har minute asankhya dukh detaa rahaa, or abhi bhi de rahaa he
 Then how do you think of taking the side of his misdeeds, which is more every moment than Genghis Khan? Is all this happening later to reward these innocent victims and punish those who commit mistakes? OK OK
 tum kab tak us vyakti ko uchit tehraate rahoge, jo hamaare sharir par ghaav karne kaa saahas isaliye karata he ki baad main mulaayam or aaramdaayak malaham lagaayegaa? To what extent did the administrators of the Gladiator organization justify throwing a man in front of a hungry bloodless lion, that if he saves his life, he will be looked after? That is why i ask why that conscious supreme soul created this world and humans in it? To rob you of joy? Then what is the difference between him and Nero? tum musalamaanon or isaayiyon! tum to purvajanm main vishwaas nahin karte
 You, like Hindus, cannot argue that the suffering of innocent people is the result of the deeds of their past lives
 main tumse poochta hum ki us sarvashaktishaalee ne shabd dwaara vishwa ke utpatti ke liye chah din tak kyon parishram kiya? or prayek din vah kyon kahata he ki sab thik he? bulaao use aaj
 Show him past history
 use aaj kii paristhitiyon kaa adhyayan karne do
 We will see if he dares to say that all is well
 karawas kii kaal-kothriyon se lekar jhopadiyon kii bastiyon tak bhukh se tadapate lakhon insaanon se lekar un shoshit mazaduron se lekar jo poonjivadi pishaach dwaara khun chusane kii kriya ko dhairyapurvak nirutsaah se dekh rahe hai or us maanavshakti kii barbaadi dekh rahe hai, jise dekhakar koi bhi vyakti, jise tanik bhi sahaj gyaan he, bhay se sihar uthegaa, or adhik utpaadan ko zaruratmand logon main baantne ke bajaay samudr main phenk dena behatar samajhane se lekar raajaaon ke un mehalon tak jinaki neenv maanav kii haddiyon par padi he- usko yah sab dekhne do or phir kahe – sab kuch thik he! kyon or kahaan se? yahi meraa prashn he
 You are silent thik he, to main aage chalata hum
 And you Hindus, you say that those who are suffering today, they are sinners of previous lives and today's tyrants were saintly men in past lives, so they are robbing the joy of power
 mujhe yah maananaa padataa he ki aapke purvaj bahut chaalaak vyakti the
 He created theories that have the power to thwart all attempts of reason and mistrust
 nyaayashastra ke anusaar dand ko apradhi par padane vaale asar ke aadhaar par keval teen kaarnon se uchit tehraaya ja saktaa he
 They are retaliation, fear and correction
 aaj sabhi pragatisheel vichaarkon dwaara pratikaar ke siddhanth kii ninda kii jaati he
 The end of the principle of fear is also there
 sudhaar karne kaa siddhanth hi keval aavashyak he or maanavtaa kii pragati ke liye anivaary he
 Its mission is to return the offender to society as a qualified and peaceful citizen
 kintu yadi ham manushyon ko apradhi maan bhi len, to ishwar dwaara unhen diye gayi dand kii kya prakruti he? tum kehete ho vah unhen gaay, billi, ped, jadi-booti yaa jaanavar banaakar paidaa karata he
 You count 84 lakh such punishments
 main poochta hum ki manushya par inkaa sudhaarak ke rup main kya asar he? tum aise kitne vyaktiyon se mili ho, jo yah kehete hai ki ve kisi paap ke kaaran purvajanm main gadhaa ke rup main paidaa hue the? ek bhi nahin? apane puraanon se udhaaharan na do
 i have no place for your mythology
 or phir kya tumhen pataa he ki duniya main sabase bada paap garib hona he
 Poverty is a curse
 yah ek dand he
 To what extent should i praise the punishment process, which inevitably compels a man to commit more crimes? Did not your God think this or did he have to learn all these things from the experience of humanity at the cost of suffering inexplicable sufferings? What do you think, what will be the fate of a human being when a poor or illiterate family, like a chamar or a scavenger is born here? Since he is poor, he cannot study
 vah apane saathiyon se tiraskrit evam parityakt rahata he, jo oonchi jati main paidaa hone ke kaaran apane ko ooncha samajhate hai
 His ignorance, his poverty and his treatment make his heart callous to society
 yadi vah koi paap karata he to uskaa fal koun bhogega? ishvar, vah swayan yaa samaaj ke manishi? or un logon ke dand ke bare main kya hoga, jinhen dambhi brahmanon ne jaanboojh kar agyani banaaye rakhaa or jinako tumhaari gyaan kii pavitra pustakon – vedon ke kuch vaakya sun lene ke kaaran kaan main pighale sise kii dhara sahan karne kii sajaa bhugatni padati thi? yadi ve koi aparaadh karte hai, to uske liye koun zimmedaar hoga? or unka prahaar koun sahegaa? My dear friends These principles are inventions of privileged people
 ye apni hathiyaan hui shakti, puunji or ucchata ko in siddhanton ke aadhaar par sahi tehraate hai
 Uptan Sinclair wrote that just make a man believe in immortality and then rob all his property
 vah bagaiyr badbadaaye is kaary main tumhaari sahaayta karegaa
 Prisons, hangings, whips and these doctrines arise only from the alliance of preachers of religion and the masters of power
 main poochta hum tumhaara sarvashaktishaalee ishwar har vyakti ko kyon nahin us samay roktaa he jab vah koi paap yaa aparaadh kar rahaa hota he? yah to vah bahut aasaani se kar saktaa he
 Why didn't he end the fighting rage of the fighting kings and thus save him from the plagues of humanity by the world war? Why did he not evoke the feeling of liberating India in the British mind? Why wouldn't it fill the benevolent zeal in the hearts of the capitalists to relinquish their right to personal property over the means of production and thus only liberate the entire working community, but the entire human society, from the capitalist fetters? You want to argue the practicality of socialism
 main ise aapke sarvashaktimaan par chhod detaa hum ki vah lagu kare
 As far as general good is concerned, people regard the virtues of socialism
 ve iske vyaavhaarik na hone kaa bahaanaa lekar iskaa virodh karte hai
 Let the divine come and do that thing in the right way
 angrejon kii hukumat yahaan isaliye nahin he ki ishwar chahta he balki isaliye ki unke paas takat he or hamamen unka virodh karne kii himmat nahin
 They have not placed us in their dominion with the help of God, but with the help of guns, rifles, bombs and bullets, police and army
 yah hamaari udaseenta he ki ve samaaj ke viruddh sabase nindaneey aparaadh – ek raashtra kaa duusare raashtra dwaara atyaachaar purna shoshan – safaltaapurvak kar rahe hai
 Where is God? Is he enjoying these sufferings of mankind? One Nero, one Genghis, perish! kya tum mujhase poochhate ho ki main is vishwa kii utpatti or maanav kii utpatti kii vyakhya kaise karata hum? thik he, main tumhen bataata hum
 Charles Darwin has tried to throw some light on the subject
 use padho
 It is a phenomenon of nature
 vibhinn padaarthon ke, niharika ke aakaar main, aakasmik mishran se prithvi bani
 When? Look at the history
 isi prakaar kii ghatana se jantu paidaa hue or ek lambe daur main maanav
 Read Darwin's 'origin of Fauna'
 or taduparant sara vikaas manushya dwaara prakruti ke lagaataar virodh or us par vijay praapt karne kii cheshtaa se hua
 This is probably the most nuanced explanation of this incident
 tumhaara doosraa tark yah ho saktaa he ki kyon ek baccha andhaa yaa langadaa paidaa hota he? kya yah uske purvajanm main kiye gayi kaaryon kaa fal nahin he? jeevigyaan vettaon ne is samasya kaa vaigyanik samaadhaan nikaal liya he
 Of course you can ask another childish question
 yadi ishwar nahin he, to log usamen vishwaas kyon karne lage? meraa uttar sookshm or spasht he
 Just as they started believing in phantoms and evil spirits
 antar keval itnaa he ki ishwar main vishwaas vishwavyaapee he or darshan atyant viksit
 Its genesis is attributed to the genius of the exploiters, who preached the existence of God and wanted to keep the people in their dominion and asked for the right and approval of their specific position
 sabhi dharm, sampradaay, panth or aisi anya sansthaaen ant main nirdayee or shoshak sansthaaon, vyaktiyon or virgon kii samarthak ho jaati hai
 Every rebellion against the king has always been a sin in every religion
 manushya kii simaaon ko pahchaanane par, uski durbalata va dosha ko samajhane ke baad pariksha kii ghadiyon main manushya ko bahaduree se saamana karne ke liye utsahit karne, sabhi khataron ko purushatv ke saath jhelane or sampannataa evam aishwarya main uske visphot ko baandhne ke liye ishwar ke kaalpanik astitv kii rachana hui
 The full God was conceived and depicted by his personal rules and parental generosity
 jab uski ugrata or vyaktigat niyamon kii charchaa hoti he, to uskaa upyog ek bhay dikhaane vaale ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 So that no man becomes a threat to society
 jab uske abhibhavak gunon kii vyakhya hoti he, to uskaa upyog ek pita, mata, bhai, bahan, dost or sahaayak kii tarah kiya jaataa he
 When a man is in great distress at betrayal and abandonment by all his friends, he can be comforted by the idea that a true friend is always there to help him, support him and he is almighty and can do anything
 vastav main aadim kaal main yah samaaj ke liye upyogi tha
 Imagination of God is useful for a person suffering
 samaaj ko is vishwaas ke viruddh ladanaa hoga
 When a man tries to stand on his feet and becomes realistic, then he should throw reverence aside and face all the sufferings, troubles in manhood in which circumstances may strike him
 yahi aaj meri sthiti he
 This is not my ego, my friend! This is my way of thinking, which has made me an atheist
 tippaniyan i consider faith in God and daily prayer to be the most selfish and fallen work for man
 maine un naastikon ke bare main padhaa he, jinhone sabhi vipadaaon kaa bahaduree se saamana kiya
 Therefore, i also want to stand with my head raised till the last moment of the hanging loop like a man
 hamen dekhnaa he ki main kaise nibhaa paata hum
 a friend of mine asked me to pray
 jab maine use naastik hone kii baat bataayi to usne kaha, ‘'apane antim dinon main tum vishwaas karne lagoge
 "I said," No, dear friend, that will not happen
 main ise apane liye apmanjanak or bhrasht hone kii baat samajhaata hum
 i will not pray for selfish reasons
 '’ pathakon or doston, kya yah ahankaar he? agar he to main sweekaar karata hum
 In both these situations he cannot become a true atheist
 pehali avasthaa main to vah apane pratidwandvi ke astitv ko nakaarta hi nahin he
 Even in the second stage, he assumes the existence of a consciousness that conducts all the activities of nature from behind the curtain
 main to us sarvashaktimaan param aatma ke astitv se hi inkaar karata hum
 It is not arrogance that motivated me to accept the doctrine of atheism
 main na to ek pratidwandvi hum, na hi ek avatar or na hi swayan paramatma
 To disprove this allegation, let us consider the facts
 mere in doston ke anusaar, dilli bam cese or lahore shadyantra cese ke dauraan mujhe jo anaavashyak yash mila, shaayad us kaaran main vruthabhimani ho gaya hum
 My atheism is not of recent origin
 maine to ishwar par vishwaas karnaa tab chhod diya tha, jab main ek aprasiddh noujvaan tha
 At least one college student cannot cultivate any undue ego that leads him to atheism
 yadhyapi main kuch adhyapakon kaa chaheta tha or kuch anya ko main acha nahin lagata tha
 But i have never been a hardworking or educated student
 ahankaar jaisi bhaavana main funsane kaa koi mauka hi na mil sakaa
 i was a very shy boy who had some pessimistic nature about the future
 mere baba, jinke prabhaav main main bada hua, ek roodhiwaadee arya samaji hai
 An Arya Samaj is anything but an atheist
 apni praathmik shiksha puri karne ke baad maine di
 a
 ve
 Entered school in Lahore and stayed in his hostel for a whole year
 vahaan subah or shaam kii prarthana ke atirikt main ghanton gayatri mantra japa karata tha
 i was a devotee in those days
 baad main maine apane pita ke saath rahanaa shuru kiya
 He is a liberal as far as religious orthodoxy is concerned
 unheen kii shiksha se mujhe swatantrata ke dhyey ke liye apane jivan ko samarpit karne kii prerana mili
 But they are not atheists
 unka ishwar main drudh vishwaas he
 They used to encourage me to pray and pray every day
 is prakaar se meraa paalan-poshan hua
 Entered the National College in the days of non-cooperation Movement
 yahaan aakar hi maine sari dharmik samasyaon– yahaan tak ki ishwar ke astitv ke bare main udaartaapurvak sochna, vichaarna or uski aalochana karnaa shuru kiya
 But i was still a firm believer
 us samay tak main apane lambe bal rakhata tha
 Although i could never believe in the mythology and principles of Sikhs or other religions
 kintu meri ishwar ke astitv main drudh nishtha thi
 Later i joined the revolutionary party
 vahaan jis pehle netaa se meraa sampark hua ve to pakkaa vishwaas na hote hue bhi ishwar ke astitv ko nakaarne kaa saahas hi nahin kar sakate the
 On my persistent inquiries about God, he would say, 'when you want, then do worship
 ' yah naastikta he, jisamen saahas kaa abhaav he
 The other leader, whom i came in contact with, is a firm devotee, respected comrade Shachindra Nath Sanyal, currently serving life imprisonment in connection with the Kakori Conspiracy Case
 unki pustak ‘bandi jivan’ ishwar kii mahima kaa jor-shor se gaan he
 They have showered him with flowers on God because of the mystic Vedanta
 28 janvari, 1925 ko puure bharat main jo ‘di revolutionari’ (krantikari) parchaa baanta gaya tha, vah unheen ke bauddhik shram kaa parinaam he
 It praises the Almighty and his actions and actions
 meraa ishwar ke prati avishvaas kaa bhav krantikari dal main bhi prasphutit nahin hua tha
 All the four martyrs of Kakori spent their last days in hymns and prayers
 ram prasad ‘bismil’ ek roodhiwaadee arya samaji the
 Despite his extensive studies in socialism and communism, Rajen Lahiri could not suppress his desire to pronounce the verses of the Upanishads and the Gita
 maine un sab main sirf ek hi vyakti ko dekha, jo kabhi prarthana nahin karata tha or kahata tha, ‘'darshan shaastra manushya kii durbalata athwa gyaan ke simit hone ke kaaran utpann hota he
 He is also serving a life-long banishment sentence
 parantu usne bhi ishwar ke astitv ko nakaarne kii kabhi himmat nahin kii
 By this time i was only a romantic idealist revolutionary
 ab tak ham dusron kaa anusaran karte the
 Now the time had come to take responsibility on his shoulders
 yah mere krantikari jivan kaa ek nirnaayak bindu tha
 The call of 'study' was echoing in the corridors of my mind - study to be able to face the arguments put forward by the opponents
 apane mat ke paksh main tark dene ke liye sakasham hone ke vaaste padho
 i started studying
 isse mere puraane vichaar or vishwaas adbhut rup se parishkrut hue
 Romance was replaced by serious ideas, no more mysticism, nor superstition
 yatharthwaad hamaara aadhaar bana
 i got a lot of opportunity to read about many ideals of world revolution
 maine araajaktaavaadi netaa bukanin ko padhaa, kuch samyawad ke pita marks ko, kintu adhik lenin, tratski, va anya logon ko padhaa, jo apane desh main safaltaapurvak kranti laaye the
 They were all atheists
 baad main mujhe niralamb swami kii pustak ‘sahaj gyaan’ mili
 It had mystic atheism
 1926 ke ant tak mujhe is baat kaa vishwaas ho gaya ki ek sarvashaktimaan param aatma kii baat, jisane brahmand kaa srijan, digdarshan or sanchaalan kiya, ek kori bakawaas he
 i showed my disbelief
 maine is vishay par apane doston se bahes kii
 i was a declared atheist
 may 1927 main main lahore main giraftaar hua
 i had to spend a month in the railway police lockup
 police afasaron ne mujhe bataaya ki main lakhanu main tha, jab vahaan kakori dal kaa mukadmaa chal rahaa tha, ki maine unhen chhudaane kii kisi yojana par baat kii thi, ki unki sahmati paane ke baad hamane kuch bam praapt kiye the, ki 1927 main dashahra ke avasar par un bamon main se ek pareekshan ke liye bheed par phenkaa gaya, ki yadi main krantikari dal kii gatividhiyon par prakaash daalane vaala ek vaktavy de duun, to mujhe giraftaar nahin kiya jaayegaa or iske vipareet mujhe adaalat main mubir kii tarah pesh kiye bagaiyr reeha kar diya jaayegaa or inaam diya jaayegaa
 i laughed at the proposal
 yah sab bekaar kii baat thi
 We, like people, do not throw bombs on our innocent people
 ek din subah si
 I
 di
 Senior Superintendent of India Mr
 Neuman said that if i did not make such a statement, i would be forced to prosecute for conspiracy to wage a rebellion related to the Kakori case and for brutal murders in the Dussehra nuisance and that i would have the punishment and execution to hang me There is proper evidence for usee din se kuch police afasaron ne mujhe niyam se donon samay ishwar kii stuti karne ke liye phuslaana shuru kiya
 But now i was an atheist
 main swayan ke liye yah baat tay karnaa chahta tha ki kya shaanti or anand ke dinon main hi main naastik hone kaa dambh bharta hum yaa aise kathin samay main bhi main un siddhanton par adig rah saktaa hum
 After much thought, i decided that i could not believe and pray to God in any way
 nahin, maine ek kshan ke liye bhi nahin kii
 This was the real test and i was successful
 ab main ek pakkaa avishvasi tha or tab se lagaataar hum
 Passing this test was not an easy task
 ‘vishwaas’ kashton ko halakaa kar detaa he
 You can even make them pleasantly
 ishwar main manushya ko atyadhik santvana dene vaala ek aadhaar mil saktaa he
 Without that a man has to depend on himself
 toofaan or jhanjhaavat ke bich apane paanvon par khadaa rahanaa koi bacchon kaa khel nahin he
 If there is arrogance in these watches of examination, then steam evaporates and a man is not able to dare to reject his faith
 yadi aisa karata he, to isse yah nishkarsh nikalataa he ki uske paas sirf ahankaar nahin varan koi anya shakti he
 Today is exactly the same situation
 nirnay kaa puraa-puraa pataa he
 Within a week it will be announced that i am going to give up my life on one goal
 is vichaar ke atirikt or kya santvana ho sakati he? a Hindu who believes in God can hope to be a king on rebirth
 ek musalmaan yaa isai swarg main vyaapt samruddhi ke anand kii or apane kashton or balidaan ke liye puraskaar kii kalpana kar saktaa he
 But what can i expect? i know that the moment the loop of the rope falls on my neck and the bottom of my foot falls, it will be a complete stop - that will be the last moment
 main yaa meri aatma sab vahiin samaapt ho jaayegi
 Nothing will be ahead
 ek choti si juujhati hui zindagi, jisaki koi aisi gauravshaalee parinti nahin he, apane main swayan ek puraskaar hogi– yadi mujhamen is drushti se dekhne kaa saahas ho
 Without any selfishness here or without a desire for rewards here and there, i have surrendered my life to the goal of freedom, because i could not do anything else
 jis din hamen is manovriti ke bahut-se purush or mahilaayein mil jaayenge, jo apane jivan ko manushya kii seva or peedit maanavtaa ke uddhaar ke atirikt kahin samarpit kar hi nahin sakate, usee din mukti ke yug kaa shubharambh hoga
 They will be motivated to challenge exploiters, oppressors and oppressors
 is liye nahin ki unhen raja bananaa he yaa koi anya puraskaar praapt karnaa he yahaan yaa agle janm main yaa mrityoparant swarg main
 They will have to adopt this path to take the slavery gamble from the neck of humanity and establish liberation and peace
 kya ve us raste par chalenge jo unke apane liye khataranaak kintu unki mahaan aatma ke liye ek maatr kalpaneey rasta he
 Will his pride be misinterpreted as arrogance towards this noble cause? Who would dare to speak such a disgusting adjective? Either he is stupid or sly
 hamen chahie ki use kshamaa kar den, kyonki vah us hriday main udwelit ucch vichaaron, bhaawanaaon, aavegon or unki gaharaai ko mahasoos nahin kar saktaa
 His heart is dead like a piece of flesh
 uski ankhon par anya swaarthon ke preton kii chaaya padane se ve kamazor ho gayi hai
 The virtue of trusting oneself can always be termed as ego
 yah dukhapurna or kshtprad he, par chaara hi kya he? Criticism and free thought are both essential qualities of a revolutionary
 kyonki hamaare purvajon ne kisi param aatma ke prati vishwaas bana liya tha
 Therefore, any person who challenges that faith to the truth or the existence of that supreme soul will be called heretical, treacherous
 yadi uske tark itane akatya hai ki unka khandan vitark dwaara nahin ho saktaa or uski aasthaa itani prabal he ki use ishwar ke prakope se hone vaali vipattiyon kaa bhay dikhaa kar dabaaya nahin ja saktaa to uski yah kah kar ninda kii jaayegi ki vah vruthabhimani he
 It was not my ego that led me to atheism
 mere tark kaa tarika santoshprad siddh hota he yaa nahin iskaa nirnay mere pathakon ko karnaa he, mujhe nahin
 i know that faith in God would have made my life easier and my burden lighter today
 us par mere avishvaas ne saare vaataavaran ko atyant shushk bana diya he
 a little mysticism can make it poetic
 kintu mere bhagya ko kisi unmaad kaa sahaara nahin chahie
 i am realistic
 main antah prakruti par vivek kii sahaayta se vijay chahta hum
 i have not always succeeded in this cause
 prayaas karnaa manushya kaa kartavya he
 Success depends on coincidence and environment
 koi bhi manushya, jisamen tanik bhi vivek shakti he, vah apane vaataavaran ko taarkik rup se samajhnaa chahega
 Where there is no direct evidence, philosophy is important
 jab hamaare purvajon ne fursat ke samay vishwa ke rahasy ko, iske bhoot, vartmaan evam bhavishya ko, iske kyon or kahaan se ko samajhane kaa prayaas kiya to sidhe parinaamon ke kathin abhaav main har vyakti ne in prashnon ko apane bhang se hal kiya
 This is the reason why we find such a difference in different religious views, which sometimes takes the form of disharmony and quarrels
 na keval purv or pashchim ke darshanon main matbhed he, balki prayek golardh ke apane vibhinn maton main aapas main antar he
 In the earlier religions, there is no conformity between Islam and Hinduism
 bharat main hi buddha or jain dharm us brahmanwad se bahut alag he, jisamen swayan aryasamaj va sanathan dharm jaise virdohi mat paye jate hai
 Charwak is an old-time independent thinker
 usne ishwar ko puraane samay main hi chunauti di thi
 Everyone believes himself to be right
 durbhaagya kii baat he ki bajaay puraane vichaarkon ke anubhavon or vichaaron ko bhavishya main agyanta ke viruddh ladaai kaa aadhaar banane ke ham aalasiyon kii tarah, jo ham siddh ho chuke hai, unke kathan main avichal evam sanshayheen vishwaas kii cheekh pukaar karte rahete hai or is prakaar maanavtaa ke vikaas ko jad banane ke doshi hai
 Only faith and blind faith are dangerous
 yah mastishk ko mudh or manushya ko pratikriyaavaadi bana detaa he
 a man who claims to be realistic must challenge all ancient orthodox beliefs
 prachlit maton ko tark kii kasuti par kasnaa hoga
 If they could not bear the brunt of the argument, they would fall to pieces
 tab naye darshan kii sthapana ke liye unako puraa dharashayi karke jagah saaf karnaa or puraane vishwaason kii kuch baton kaa prayog karke punarniman karnaa
 i am confident about questioning the constancy of ancient beliefs
 mujhe puraa vishwaas he ki ek chetan param aatma kaa, jo prakruti kii gati kaa digdarshan evam sanchaalan karata he, koi astitv nahin he
 We believe in nature and the aim of the entire progressive movement is for man to conquer nature for his service
 isko disha dene ke peeche koi chetan shakti nahin he
 This is our philosophy
 ham aastikon se kuch prashn karnaa chaahate hai
 If you believe that there is an omnipotent, omniscient and omniscient God who created the world, then please tell me why he created it
 a world full of sorrows and sorrows - afflicted by eternal eternal alliances of innumerable sufferings! Not a single person is completely saturated
 kripaya yah na kahen ki yahi uskaa niyam he
 If he is bound by a rule he is not omnipotent
 vah bhi hamaari hi tarah niyamon kaa das he
 Please do not even say that this is his entertainment
 nero ne bas ek rome jalaayaa tha
 He killed a small number of people
 usne to bahut thodaa dukh paidaa kiya, apane purna manoranjan ke liye
 And what is its place in history? By what name are historians called him? All the poisonous adjectives are showered on him
 panne uski ninda ke vaakyon se kaale pute hai, bhartsana karte hai – nero ek hridayaheen, nirdayee, dusht
 a Genghis Khan took a few thousand lives for his joy and today we hate his name
 tab kis prakaar tum apane ishwar ko nyyochit tehraate ho? us shaashvat nero ko, jo har din, har ghante ore har minute asankhya dukh detaa rahaa, or abhi bhi de rahaa he
 Then how do you think of taking the side of his misdeeds, which is more every moment than Genghis Khan? Is all this happening later to reward these innocent victims and punish those who commit mistakes? OK OK
 tum kab tak us vyakti ko uchit tehraate rahoge, jo hamaare sharir par ghaav karne kaa saahas isaliye karata he ki baad main mulaayam or aaramdaayak malaham lagaayegaa? To what extent did the administrators of the Gladiator organization justify throwing a man in front of a hungry bloodless lion, that if he saves his life, he will be looked after? That is why i ask why that conscious supreme soul created this world and humans in it? To rob you of joy? Then what is the difference between him and Nero? tum musalamaanon or isaayiyon! tum to purvajanm main vishwaas nahin karte
 You, like Hindus, cannot argue that the suffering of innocent people is the result of the deeds of their past lives
 main tumse poochta hum ki us sarvashaktishaalee ne shabd dwaara vishwa ke utpatti ke liye chah din tak kyon parishram kiya? or prayek din vah kyon kahata he ki sab thik he? bulaao use aaj
 Show him past history
 use aaj kii paristhitiyon kaa adhyayan karne do
 We will see if he dares to say that all is well
 karawas kii kaal-kothriyon se lekar jhopadiyon kii bastiyon tak bhukh se tadapate lakhon insaanon se lekar un shoshit mazaduron se lekar jo poonjivadi pishaach dwaara khun chusane kii kriya ko dhairyapurvak nirutsaah se dekh rahe hai or us maanavshakti kii barbaadi dekh rahe hai, jise dekhakar koi bhi vyakti, jise tanik bhi sahaj gyaan he, bhay se sihar uthegaa, or adhik utpaadan ko zaruratmand logon main baantne ke bajaay samudr main phenk dena behatar samajhane se lekar raajaaon ke un mehalon tak jinaki neenv maanav kii haddiyon par padi he- usko yah sab dekhne do or phir kahe – sab kuch thik he! kyon or kahaan se? yahi meraa prashn he
 You are silent thik he, to main aage chalata hum
 And you Hindus, you say that those who are suffering today, they are sinners of previous lives and today's tyrants were saintly men in past lives, so they are robbing the joy of power
 mujhe yah maananaa padataa he ki aapke purvaj bahut chaalaak vyakti the
 He created theories that have the power to thwart all attempts of reason and mistrust
 nyaayashastra ke anusaar dand ko apradhi par padane vaale asar ke aadhaar par keval teen kaarnon se uchit tehraaya ja saktaa he
 They are retaliation, fear and correction
 aaj sabhi pragatisheel vichaarkon dwaara pratikaar ke siddhanth kii ninda kii jaati he
 The end of the principle of fear is also there
 sudhaar karne kaa siddhanth hi keval aavashyak he or maanavtaa kii pragati ke liye anivaary he
 Its mission is to return the offender to society as a qualified and peaceful citizen
 kintu yadi ham manushyon ko apradhi maan bhi len, to ishwar dwaara unhen diye gayi dand kii kya prakruti he? tum kehete ho vah unhen gaay, billi, ped, jadi-booti yaa jaanavar banaakar paidaa karata he
 You count 84 lakh such punishments
 main poochta hum ki manushya par inkaa sudhaarak ke rup main kya asar he? tum aise kitne vyaktiyon se mili ho, jo yah kehete hai ki ve kisi paap ke kaaran purvajanm main gadhaa ke rup main paidaa hue the? ek bhi nahin? apane puraanon se udhaaharan na do
 i have no place for your mythology
 or phir kya tumhen pataa he ki duniya main sabase bada paap garib hona he
 Poverty is a curse
 yah ek dand he
 To what extent should i praise the punishment process, which inevitably compels a man to commit more crimes? Did not your God think this or did he have to learn all these things from the experience of humanity at the cost of suffering inexplicable sufferings? What do you think, what will be the fate of a human being when a poor or illiterate family, like a chamar or a scavenger is born here? Since he is poor, he cannot study
 vah apane saathiyon se tiraskrit evam parityakt rahata he, jo oonchi jati main paidaa hone ke kaaran apane ko ooncha samajhate hai
 His ignorance, his poverty and his treatment make his heart callous to society
 yadi vah koi paap karata he to uskaa fal koun bhogega? ishvar, vah swayan yaa samaaj ke manishi? or un logon ke dand ke bare main kya hoga, jinhen dambhi brahmanon ne jaanboojh kar agyani banaaye rakhaa or jinako tumhaari gyaan kii pavitra pustakon – vedon ke kuch vaakya sun lene ke kaaran kaan main pighale sise kii dhara sahan karne kii sajaa bhugatni padati thi? yadi ve koi aparaadh karte hai, to uske liye koun zimmedaar hoga? or unka prahaar koun sahegaa? My dear friends These principles are inventions of privileged people
 ye apni hathiyaan hui shakti, puunji or ucchata ko in siddhanton ke aadhaar par sahi tehraate hai
 Uptan Sinclair wrote that just make a man believe in immortality and then rob all his property
 vah bagaiyr badbadaaye is kaary main tumhaari sahaayta karegaa
 Prisons, hangings, whips and these doctrines arise only from the alliance of preachers of religion and the masters of power
 main poochta hum tumhaara sarvashaktishaalee ishwar har vyakti ko kyon nahin us samay roktaa he jab vah koi paap yaa aparaadh kar rahaa hota he? yah to vah bahut aasaani se kar saktaa he
 Why didn't he end the fighting rage of the fighting kings and thus save him from the plagues of humanity by the world war? Why did he not evoke the feeling of liberating India in the British mind? Why wouldn't it fill the benevolent zeal in the hearts of the capitalists to relinquish their right to personal property over the means of production and thus only liberate the entire working community, but the entire human society, from the capitalist fetters? You want to argue the practicality of socialism
 main ise aapke sarvashaktimaan par chhod detaa hum ki vah lagu kare
 As far as general good is concerned, people regard the virtues of socialism
 ve iske vyaavhaarik na hone kaa bahaanaa lekar iskaa virodh karte hai
 Let the divine come and do that thing in the right way
 angrejon kii hukumat yahaan isaliye nahin he ki ishwar chahta he balki isaliye ki unke paas takat he or hamamen unka virodh karne kii himmat nahin
 They have not placed us in their dominion with the help of God, but with the help of guns, rifles, bombs and bullets, police and army
 yah hamaari udaseenta he ki ve samaaj ke viruddh sabase nindaneey aparaadh – ek raashtra kaa duusare raashtra dwaara atyaachaar purna shoshan – safaltaapurvak kar rahe hai
 Where is God? Is he enjoying these sufferings of mankind? One Nero, one Genghis, perish! kya tum mujhase poochhate ho ki main is vishwa kii utpatti or maanav kii utpatti kii vyakhya kaise karata hum? thik he, main tumhen bataata hum
 Charles Darwin has tried to throw some light on the subject
 use padho
 It is a phenomenon of nature
 vibhinn padaarthon ke, niharika ke aakaar main, aakasmik mishran se prithvi bani
 When? Look at the history
 isi prakaar kii ghatana se jantu paidaa hue or ek lambe daur main maanav
 Read Darwin's 'origin of Fauna'
 or taduparant sara vikaas manushya dwaara prakruti ke lagaataar virodh or us par vijay praapt karne kii cheshtaa se hua
 This is probably the most nuanced explanation of this incident
 tumhaara doosraa tark yah ho saktaa he ki kyon ek baccha andhaa yaa langadaa paidaa hota he? kya yah uske purvajanm main kiye gayi kaaryon kaa fal nahin he? jeevigyaan vettaon ne is samasya kaa vaigyanik samaadhaan nikaal liya he
 Of course you can ask another childish question
 yadi ishwar nahin he, to log usamen vishwaas kyon karne lage? meraa uttar sookshm or spasht he
 Just as they started believing in phantoms and evil spirits
 antar keval itnaa he ki ishwar main vishwaas vishwavyaapee he or darshan atyant viksit
 Its genesis is attributed to the genius of the exploiters, who preached the existence of God and wanted to keep the people in their dominion and asked for the right and approval of their specific position
 sabhi dharm, sampradaay, panth or aisi anya sansthaaen ant main nirdayee or shoshak sansthaaon, vyaktiyon or virgon kii samarthak ho jaati hai
 Every rebellion against the king has always been a sin in every religion
 manushya kii simaaon ko pahchaanane par, uski durbalata va dosha ko samajhane ke baad pariksha kii ghadiyon main manushya ko bahaduree se saamana karne ke liye utsahit karne, sabhi khataron ko purushatv ke saath jhelane or sampannataa evam aishwarya main uske visphot ko baandhne ke liye ishwar ke kaalpanik astitv kii rachana hui
 The full God was conceived and depicted by his personal rules and parental generosity
 jab uski ugrata or vyaktigat niyamon kii charchaa hoti he, to uskaa upyog ek bhay dikhaane vaale ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 So that no man becomes a threat to society
 jab uske abhibhavak gunon kii vyakhya hoti he, to uskaa upyog ek pita, mata, bhai, bahan, dost or sahaayak kii tarah kiya jaataa he
 When a man is in great distress at betrayal and abandonment by all his friends, he can be comforted by the idea that a true friend is always there to help him, support him and he is almighty and can do anything
 vastav main aadim kaal main yah samaaj ke liye upyogi tha
 Imagination of God is useful for a person suffering
 samaaj ko is vishwaas ke viruddh ladanaa hoga
 When a man tries to stand on his feet and becomes realistic, then he should throw reverence aside and face all the sufferings, troubles in manhood in which circumstances may strike him
 yahi aaj meri sthiti he
 This is not my ego, my friend! This is my way of thinking, which has made me an atheist
 tippaniyan i consider faith in God and daily prayer to be the most selfish and fallen work for man
 maine un naastikon ke bare main padhaa he, jinhone sabhi vipadaaon kaa bahaduree se saamana kiya
 Therefore, i also want to stand with my head raised till the last moment of the hanging loop like a man
 hamen dekhnaa he ki main kaise nibhaa paata hum
 a friend of mine asked me to pray
 jab maine use naastik hone kii baat bataayi to usne kaha, ‘'apane antim dinon main tum vishwaas karne lagoge
 "I said," No, dear friend, that will not happen
 main ise apane liye apmanjanak or bhrasht hone kii baat samajhaata hum
 i will not pray for selfish reasons
 '’ pathakon or doston, kya yah ahankaar he? agar he to main sweekaar karata hum
 My atheism is not of recent origin
 maine to ishwar par vishwaas karnaa tab chhod diya tha, jab main ek aprasiddh noujvaan tha
 At least one college student cannot cultivate any undue ego that leads him to atheism
 yadhyapi main kuch adhyapakon kaa chaheta tha or kuch anya ko main acha nahin lagata tha
 But i have never been a hardworking or educated student
 ahankaar jaisi bhaavana main funsane kaa koi mauka hi na mil sakaa
 i was a very shy boy who had some pessimistic nature about the future
 mere baba, jinke prabhaav main main bada hua, ek roodhiwaadee arya samaji hai
 An Arya Samaj is anything but an atheist
 apni praathmik shiksha puri karne ke baad maine di
 a
 ve
 Entered school in Lahore and stayed in his hostel for a whole year
 vahaan subah or shaam kii prarthana ke atirikt main ghanton gayatri mantra japa karata tha
 i was a devotee in those days
 baad main maine apane pita ke saath rahanaa shuru kiya
 He is a liberal as far as religious orthodoxy is concerned
 unheen kii shiksha se mujhe swatantrata ke dhyey ke liye apane jivan ko samarpit karne kii prerana mili
 But they are not atheists
 unka ishwar main drudh vishwaas he
 They used to encourage me to pray and pray every day
 is prakaar se meraa paalan-poshan hua
 Entered the National College in the days of non-cooperation Movement
 yahaan aakar hi maine sari dharmik samasyaon– yahaan tak ki ishwar ke astitv ke bare main udaartaapurvak sochna, vichaarna or uski aalochana karnaa shuru kiya
 But i was still a firm believer
 us samay tak main apane lambe bal rakhata tha
 Although i could never believe in the mythology and principles of Sikhs or other religions
 kintu meri ishwar ke astitv main drudh nishtha thi
 Later i joined the revolutionary party
 vahaan jis pehle netaa se meraa sampark hua ve to pakkaa vishwaas na hote hue bhi ishwar ke astitv ko nakaarne kaa saahas hi nahin kar sakate the
 On my persistent inquiries about God, he would say, 'when you want, then do worship
 ' yah naastikta he, jisamen saahas kaa abhaav he
 The other leader, whom i came in contact with, is a firm devotee, respected comrade Shachindra Nath Sanyal, currently serving life imprisonment in connection with the Kakori Conspiracy Case
 unki pustak ‘bandi jivan’ ishwar kii mahima kaa jor-shor se gaan he
 They have showered him with flowers on God because of the mystic Vedanta
 28 janvari, 1925 ko puure bharat main jo ‘di revolutionari’ (krantikari) parchaa baanta gaya tha, vah unheen ke bauddhik shram kaa parinaam he
 It praises the Almighty and his actions and actions
 meraa ishwar ke prati avishvaas kaa bhav krantikari dal main bhi prasphutit nahin hua tha
 All the four martyrs of Kakori spent their last days in hymns and prayers
 ram prasad ‘bismil’ ek roodhiwaadee arya samaji the
 Despite his extensive studies in socialism and communism, Rajen Lahiri could not suppress his desire to pronounce the verses of the Upanishads and the Gita
 maine un sab main sirf ek hi vyakti ko dekha, jo kabhi prarthana nahin karata tha or kahata tha, ‘'darshan shaastra manushya kii durbalata athwa gyaan ke simit hone ke kaaran utpann hota he
 He is also serving a life-long banishment sentence
 parantu usne bhi ishwar ke astitv ko nakaarne kii kabhi himmat nahin kii
 By this time i was only a romantic idealist revolutionary
 ab tak ham dusron kaa anusaran karte the
 Now the time had come to take responsibility on his shoulders
 yah mere krantikari jivan kaa ek nirnaayak bindu tha
 The call of 'study' was echoing in the corridors of my mind - study to be able to face the arguments put forward by the opponents
 apane mat ke paksh main tark dene ke liye sakasham hone ke vaaste padho
 i started studying
 isse mere puraane vichaar or vishwaas adbhut rup se parishkrut hue
 Romance was replaced by serious ideas, no more mysticism, nor superstition
 yatharthwaad hamaara aadhaar bana
 i got a lot of opportunity to read about many ideals of world revolution
 maine araajaktaavaadi netaa bukanin ko padhaa, kuch samyawad ke pita marks ko, kintu adhik lenin, tratski, va anya logon ko padhaa, jo apane desh main safaltaapurvak kranti laaye the
 They were all atheists
 baad main mujhe niralamb swami kii pustak ‘sahaj gyaan’ mili
 It had mystic atheism
 1926 ke ant tak mujhe is baat kaa vishwaas ho gaya ki ek sarvashaktimaan param aatma kii baat, jisane brahmand kaa srijan, digdarshan or sanchaalan kiya, ek kori bakawaas he
 i showed my disbelief
 maine is vishay par apane doston se bahes kii
 i was a declared atheist
 may 1927 main main lahore main giraftaar hua
 i had to spend a month in the railway police lockup
 police afasaron ne mujhe bataaya ki main lakhanu main tha, jab vahaan kakori dal kaa mukadmaa chal rahaa tha, ki maine unhen chhudaane kii kisi yojana par baat kii thi, ki unki sahmati paane ke baad hamane kuch bam praapt kiye the, ki 1927 main dashahra ke avasar par un bamon main se ek pareekshan ke liye bheed par phenkaa gaya, ki yadi main krantikari dal kii gatividhiyon par prakaash daalane vaala ek vaktavy de duun, to mujhe giraftaar nahin kiya jaayegaa or iske vipareet mujhe adaalat main mubir kii tarah pesh kiye bagaiyr reeha kar diya jaayegaa or inaam diya jaayegaa
 i laughed at the proposal
 yah sab bekaar kii baat thi
 We, like people, do not throw bombs on our innocent people
 ek din subah si
 I
 di
 Senior Superintendent of India Mr
 Neuman said that if i did not make such a statement, i would be forced to prosecute for conspiracy to wage a rebellion related to the Kakori case and for brutal murders in the Dussehra nuisance and that i would have the punishment and execution to hang me There is proper evidence for usee din se kuch police afasaron ne mujhe niyam se donon samay ishwar kii stuti karne ke liye phuslaana shuru kiya
 But now i was an atheist
 main swayan ke liye yah baat tay karnaa chahta tha ki kya shaanti or anand ke dinon main hi main naastik hone kaa dambh bharta hum yaa aise kathin samay main bhi main un siddhanton par adig rah saktaa hum
 After much thought, i decided that i could not believe and pray to God in any way
 nahin, maine ek kshan ke liye bhi nahin kii
 This was the real test and i was successful
 ab main ek pakkaa avishvasi tha or tab se lagaataar hum
 Passing this test was not an easy task
 ‘vishwaas’ kashton ko halakaa kar detaa he
 You can even make them pleasantly
 ishwar main manushya ko atyadhik santvana dene vaala ek aadhaar mil saktaa he
 Without that a man has to depend on himself
 toofaan or jhanjhaavat ke bich apane paanvon par khadaa rahanaa koi bacchon kaa khel nahin he
 If there is arrogance in these watches of examination, then steam evaporates and a man is not able to dare to reject his faith
 yadi aisa karata he, to isse yah nishkarsh nikalataa he ki uske paas sirf ahankaar nahin varan koi anya shakti he
 Today is exactly the same situation
 nirnay kaa puraa-puraa pataa he
 Within a week it will be announced that i am going to give up my life on one goal
 is vichaar ke atirikt or kya santvana ho sakati he? a Hindu who believes in God can hope to be a king on rebirth
 ek musalmaan yaa isai swarg main vyaapt samruddhi ke anand kii or apane kashton or balidaan ke liye puraskaar kii kalpana kar saktaa he
 But what can i expect? i know that the moment the loop of the rope falls on my neck and the bottom of my foot falls, it will be a complete stop - that will be the last moment
 main yaa meri aatma sab vahiin samaapt ho jaayegi
 Nothing will be ahead
 ek choti si juujhati hui zindagi, jisaki koi aisi gauravshaalee parinti nahin he, apane main swayan ek puraskaar hogi– yadi mujhamen is drushti se dekhne kaa saahas ho
 Without any selfishness here or without a desire for rewards here and there, i have surrendered my life to the goal of freedom, because i could not do anything else
 jis din hamen is manovriti ke bahut-se purush or mahilaayein mil jaayenge, jo apane jivan ko manushya kii seva or peedit maanavtaa ke uddhaar ke atirikt kahin samarpit kar hi nahin sakate, usee din mukti ke yug kaa shubharambh hoga
 They will be motivated to challenge exploiters, oppressors and oppressors
 is liye nahin ki unhen raja bananaa he yaa koi anya puraskaar praapt karnaa he yahaan yaa agle janm main yaa mrityoparant swarg main
 They will have to adopt this path to take the slavery gamble from the neck of humanity and establish liberation and peace
 kya ve us raste par chalenge jo unke apane liye khataranaak kintu unki mahaan aatma ke liye ek maatr kalpaneey rasta he
 Will his pride be misinterpreted as arrogance towards this noble cause? Who would dare to speak such a disgusting adjective? Either he is stupid or sly
 hamen chahie ki use kshamaa kar den, kyonki vah us hriday main udwelit ucch vichaaron, bhaawanaaon, aavegon or unki gaharaai ko mahasoos nahin kar saktaa
 His heart is dead like a piece of flesh
 uski ankhon par anya swaarthon ke preton kii chaaya padane se ve kamazor ho gayi hai
 The virtue of trusting oneself can always be termed as ego
 yah dukhapurna or kshtprad he, par chaara hi kya he? Criticism and free thought are both essential qualities of a revolutionary
 kyonki hamaare purvajon ne kisi param aatma ke prati vishwaas bana liya tha
 Therefore, any person who challenges that faith to the truth or the existence of that supreme soul will be called heretical, treacherous
 yadi uske tark itane akatya hai ki unka khandan vitark dwaara nahin ho saktaa or uski aasthaa itani prabal he ki use ishwar ke prakope se hone vaali vipattiyon kaa bhay dikhaa kar dabaaya nahin ja saktaa to uski yah kah kar ninda kii jaayegi ki vah vruthabhimani he
 It was not my ego that led me to atheism
 mere tark kaa tarika santoshprad siddh hota he yaa nahin iskaa nirnay mere pathakon ko karnaa he, mujhe nahin
 i know that faith in God would have made my life easier and my burden lighter today
 us par mere avishvaas ne saare vaataavaran ko atyant shushk bana diya he
 a little mysticism can make it poetic
 kintu mere bhagya ko kisi unmaad kaa sahaara nahin chahie
 i am realistic
 main antah prakruti par vivek kii sahaayta se vijay chahta hum
 i have not always succeeded in this cause
 prayaas karnaa manushya kaa kartavya he
 Success depends on coincidence and environment
 koi bhi manushya, jisamen tanik bhi vivek shakti he, vah apane vaataavaran ko taarkik rup se samajhnaa chahega
 Where there is no direct evidence, philosophy is important
 jab hamaare purvajon ne fursat ke samay vishwa ke rahasy ko, iske bhoot, vartmaan evam bhavishya ko, iske kyon or kahaan se ko samajhane kaa prayaas kiya to sidhe parinaamon ke kathin abhaav main har vyakti ne in prashnon ko apane bhang se hal kiya
 This is the reason why we find such a difference in different religious views, which sometimes takes the form of disharmony and quarrels
 na keval purv or pashchim ke darshanon main matbhed he, balki prayek golardh ke apane vibhinn maton main aapas main antar he
 In the earlier religions, there is no conformity between Islam and Hinduism
 bharat main hi buddha or jain dharm us brahmanwad se bahut alag he, jisamen swayan aryasamaj va sanathan dharm jaise virdohi mat paye jate hai
 Charwak is an old-time independent thinker
 usne ishwar ko puraane samay main hi chunauti di thi
 Everyone believes himself to be right
 durbhaagya kii baat he ki bajaay puraane vichaarkon ke anubhavon or vichaaron ko bhavishya main agyanta ke viruddh ladaai kaa aadhaar banane ke ham aalasiyon kii tarah, jo ham siddh ho chuke hai, unke kathan main avichal evam sanshayheen vishwaas kii cheekh pukaar karte rahete hai or is prakaar maanavtaa ke vikaas ko jad banane ke doshi hai
 Only faith and blind faith are dangerous
 yah mastishk ko mudh or manushya ko pratikriyaavaadi bana detaa he
 a man who claims to be realistic must challenge all ancient orthodox beliefs
 prachlit maton ko tark kii kasuti par kasnaa hoga
 If they could not bear the brunt of the argument, they would fall to pieces
 tab naye darshan kii sthapana ke liye unako puraa dharashayi karke jagah saaf karnaa or puraane vishwaason kii kuch baton kaa prayog karke punarniman karnaa
 i am confident about questioning the constancy of ancient beliefs
 mujhe puraa vishwaas he ki ek chetan param aatma kaa, jo prakruti kii gati kaa digdarshan evam sanchaalan karata he, koi astitv nahin he
 We believe in nature and the aim of the entire progressive movement is for man to conquer nature for his service
 isko disha dene ke peeche koi chetan shakti nahin he
 This is our philosophy
 ham aastikon se kuch prashn karnaa chaahate hai
 If you believe that there is an omnipotent, omniscient and omniscient God who created the world, then please tell me why he created it
 a world full of sorrows and sorrows - afflicted by eternal eternal alliances of innumerable sufferings! Not a single person is completely saturated
 kripaya yah na kahen ki yahi uskaa niyam he
 If he is bound by a rule he is not omnipotent
 vah bhi hamaari hi tarah niyamon kaa das he
 Please do not even say that this is his entertainment
 nero ne bas ek rome jalaayaa tha
 He killed a small number of people
 usne to bahut thodaa dukh paidaa kiya, apane purna manoranjan ke liye
 And what is its place in history? By what name are historians called him? All the poisonous adjectives are showered on him
 panne uski ninda ke vaakyon se kaale pute hai, bhartsana karte hai – nero ek hridayaheen, nirdayee, dusht
 a Genghis Khan took a few thousand lives for his joy and today we hate his name
 tab kis prakaar tum apane ishwar ko nyyochit tehraate ho? us shaashvat nero ko, jo har din, har ghante ore har minute asankhya dukh detaa rahaa, or abhi bhi de rahaa he
 Then how do you think of taking the side of his misdeeds, which is more every moment than Genghis Khan? Is all this happening later to reward these innocent victims and punish those who commit mistakes? OK OK
 tum kab tak us vyakti ko uchit tehraate rahoge, jo hamaare sharir par ghaav karne kaa saahas isaliye karata he ki baad main mulaayam or aaramdaayak malaham lagaayegaa? To what extent did the administrators of the Gladiator organization justify throwing a man in front of a hungry bloodless lion, that if he saves his life, he will be looked after? That is why i ask why that conscious supreme soul created this world and humans in it? To rob you of joy? Then what is the difference between him and Nero? tum musalamaanon or isaayiyon! tum to purvajanm main vishwaas nahin karte
 You, like Hindus, cannot argue that the suffering of innocent people is the result of the deeds of their past lives
 main tumse poochta hum ki us sarvashaktishaalee ne shabd dwaara vishwa ke utpatti ke liye chah din tak kyon parishram kiya? or prayek din vah kyon kahata he ki sab thik he? bulaao use aaj
 Show him past history
 use aaj kii paristhitiyon kaa adhyayan karne do
 We will see if he dares to say that all is well
 karawas kii kaal-kothriyon se lekar jhopadiyon kii bastiyon tak bhukh se tadapate lakhon insaanon se lekar un shoshit mazaduron se lekar jo poonjivadi pishaach dwaara khun chusane kii kriya ko dhairyapurvak nirutsaah se dekh rahe hai or us maanavshakti kii barbaadi dekh rahe hai, jise dekhakar koi bhi vyakti, jise tanik bhi sahaj gyaan he, bhay se sihar uthegaa, or adhik utpaadan ko zaruratmand logon main baantne ke bajaay samudr main phenk dena behatar samajhane se lekar raajaaon ke un mehalon tak jinaki neenv maanav kii haddiyon par padi he- usko yah sab dekhne do or phir kahe – sab kuch thik he! kyon or kahaan se? yahi meraa prashn he
 You are silent thik he, to main aage chalata hum
 And you Hindus, you say that those who are suffering today, they are sinners of previous lives and today's tyrants were saintly men in past lives, so they are robbing the joy of power
 mujhe yah maananaa padataa he ki aapke purvaj bahut chaalaak vyakti the
 He created theories that have the power to thwart all attempts of reason and mistrust
 nyaayashastra ke anusaar dand ko apradhi par padane vaale asar ke aadhaar par keval teen kaarnon se uchit tehraaya ja saktaa he
 They are retaliation, fear and correction
 aaj sabhi pragatisheel vichaarkon dwaara pratikaar ke siddhanth kii ninda kii jaati he
 The end of the principle of fear is also there
 sudhaar karne kaa siddhanth hi keval aavashyak he or maanavtaa kii pragati ke liye anivaary he
 Its mission is to return the offender to society as a qualified and peaceful citizen
 kintu yadi ham manushyon ko apradhi maan bhi len, to ishwar dwaara unhen diye gayi dand kii kya prakruti he? tum kehete ho vah unhen gaay, billi, ped, jadi-booti yaa jaanavar banaakar paidaa karata he
 You count 84 lakh such punishments
 main poochta hum ki manushya par inkaa sudhaarak ke rup main kya asar he? tum aise kitne vyaktiyon se mili ho, jo yah kehete hai ki ve kisi paap ke kaaran purvajanm main gadhaa ke rup main paidaa hue the? ek bhi nahin? apane puraanon se udhaaharan na do
 i have no place for your mythology
 or phir kya tumhen pataa he ki duniya main sabase bada paap garib hona he
 Poverty is a curse
 yah ek dand he
 To what extent should i praise the punishment process, which inevitably compels a man to commit more crimes? Did not your God think this or did he have to learn all these things from the experience of humanity at the cost of suffering inexplicable sufferings? What do you think, what will be the fate of a human being when a poor or illiterate family, like a chamar or a scavenger is born here? Since he is poor, he cannot study
 vah apane saathiyon se tiraskrit evam parityakt rahata he, jo oonchi jati main paidaa hone ke kaaran apane ko ooncha samajhate hai
 His ignorance, his poverty and his treatment make his heart callous to society
 yadi vah koi paap karata he to uskaa fal koun bhogega? ishvar, vah swayan yaa samaaj ke manishi? or un logon ke dand ke bare main kya hoga, jinhen dambhi brahmanon ne jaanboojh kar agyani banaaye rakhaa or jinako tumhaari gyaan kii pavitra pustakon – vedon ke kuch vaakya sun lene ke kaaran kaan main pighale sise kii dhara sahan karne kii sajaa bhugatni padati thi? yadi ve koi aparaadh karte hai, to uske liye koun zimmedaar hoga? or unka prahaar koun sahegaa? My dear friends These principles are inventions of privileged people
 ye apni hathiyaan hui shakti, puunji or ucchata ko in siddhanton ke aadhaar par sahi tehraate hai
 Uptan Sinclair wrote that just make a man believe in immortality and then rob all his property
 vah bagaiyr badbadaaye is kaary main tumhaari sahaayta karegaa
 Prisons, hangings, whips and these doctrines arise only from the alliance of preachers of religion and the masters of power
 main poochta hum tumhaara sarvashaktishaalee ishwar har vyakti ko kyon nahin us samay roktaa he jab vah koi paap yaa aparaadh kar rahaa hota he? yah to vah bahut aasaani se kar saktaa he
 Why didn't he end the fighting rage of the fighting kings and thus save him from the plagues of humanity by the world war? Why did he not evoke the feeling of liberating India in the British mind? Why wouldn't it fill the benevolent zeal in the hearts of the capitalists to relinquish their right to personal property over the means of production and thus only liberate the entire working community, but the entire human society, from the capitalist fetters? You want to argue the practicality of socialism
 main ise aapke sarvashaktimaan par chhod detaa hum ki vah lagu kare
 As far as general good is concerned, people regard the virtues of socialism
 ve iske vyaavhaarik na hone kaa bahaanaa lekar iskaa virodh karte hai
 Let the divine come and do that thing in the right way
 angrejon kii hukumat yahaan isaliye nahin he ki ishwar chahta he balki isaliye ki unke paas takat he or hamamen unka virodh karne kii himmat nahin
 They have not placed us in their dominion with the help of God, but with the help of guns, rifles, bombs and bullets, police and army
 yah hamaari udaseenta he ki ve samaaj ke viruddh sabase nindaneey aparaadh – ek raashtra kaa duusare raashtra dwaara atyaachaar purna shoshan – safaltaapurvak kar rahe hai
 Where is God? Is he enjoying these sufferings of mankind? One Nero, one Genghis, perish! kya tum mujhase poochhate ho ki main is vishwa kii utpatti or maanav kii utpatti kii vyakhya kaise karata hum? thik he, main tumhen bataata hum
 Charles Darwin has tried to throw some light on the subject
 use padho
 It is a phenomenon of nature
 vibhinn padaarthon ke, niharika ke aakaar main, aakasmik mishran se prithvi bani
 When? Look at the history
 isi prakaar kii ghatana se jantu paidaa hue or ek lambe daur main maanav
 Read Darwin's 'origin of Fauna'
 or taduparant sara vikaas manushya dwaara prakruti ke lagaataar virodh or us par vijay praapt karne kii cheshtaa se hua
 This is probably the most nuanced explanation of this incident
 tumhaara doosraa tark yah ho saktaa he ki kyon ek baccha andhaa yaa langadaa paidaa hota he? kya yah uske purvajanm main kiye gayi kaaryon kaa fal nahin he? jeevigyaan vettaon ne is samasya kaa vaigyanik samaadhaan nikaal liya he
 Of course you can ask another childish question
 yadi ishwar nahin he, to log usamen vishwaas kyon karne lage? meraa uttar sookshm or spasht he
 Just as they started believing in phantoms and evil spirits
 antar keval itnaa he ki ishwar main vishwaas vishwavyaapee he or darshan atyant viksit
 Its genesis is attributed to the genius of the exploiters, who preached the existence of God and wanted to keep the people in their dominion and asked for the right and approval of their specific position
 sabhi dharm, sampradaay, panth or aisi anya sansthaaen ant main nirdayee or shoshak sansthaaon, vyaktiyon or virgon kii samarthak ho jaati hai
 Every rebellion against the king has always been a sin in every religion
 manushya kii simaaon ko pahchaanane par, uski durbalata va dosha ko samajhane ke baad pariksha kii ghadiyon main manushya ko bahaduree se saamana karne ke liye utsahit karne, sabhi khataron ko purushatv ke saath jhelane or sampannataa evam aishwarya main uske visphot ko baandhne ke liye ishwar ke kaalpanik astitv kii rachana hui
 The full God was conceived and depicted by his personal rules and parental generosity
 jab uski ugrata or vyaktigat niyamon kii charchaa hoti he, to uskaa upyog ek bhay dikhaane vaale ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 So that no man becomes a threat to society
 jab uske abhibhavak gunon kii vyakhya hoti he, to uskaa upyog ek pita, mata, bhai, bahan, dost or sahaayak kii tarah kiya jaataa he
 When a man is in great distress at betrayal and abandonment by all his friends, he can be comforted by the idea that a true friend is always there to help him, support him and he is almighty and can do anything
 vastav main aadim kaal main yah samaaj ke liye upyogi tha
 Imagination of God is useful for a person suffering
 samaaj ko is vishwaas ke viruddh ladanaa hoga
 When a man tries to stand on his feet and becomes realistic, then he should throw reverence aside and face all the sufferings, troubles in manhood in which circumstances may strike him
 yahi aaj meri sthiti he
 This is not my ego, my friend! This is my way of thinking, which has made me an atheist
 tippaniyan i consider faith in God and daily prayer to be the most selfish and fallen work for man
 maine un naastikon ke bare main padhaa he, jinhone sabhi vipadaaon kaa bahaduree se saamana kiya
 Therefore, i also want to stand with my head raised till the last moment of the hanging loop like a man
 hamen dekhnaa he ki main kaise nibhaa paata hum
 a friend of mine asked me to pray
 jab maine use naastik hone kii baat bataayi to usne kaha, ‘'apane antim dinon main tum vishwaas karne lagoge
 "I said," No, dear friend, that will not happen
 main ise apane liye apmanjanak or bhrasht hone kii baat samajhaata hum
 i will not pray for selfish reasons

 skool, lahore main pravesh liya or puure ek saal uske chatravaas main rahaa
 Apart from morning and evening prayers, i used to chant Gayatri Mantra for hours
 un dinon main puraa bhakt tha
 Later i started living with my father
 jahaan tak dharmik roodhiwaadita kaa prashn he, vah ek udaaravaadi vyakti hai
 His education inspired me to dedicate my life to the cause of freedom
 kintu ve naastik nahin hai
 He has a strong belief in God
 ve mujhe pratidin puja-prarthana ke liye protsaahit karte rahete the
 This is how i was raised
 asahyog aandolan ke dinon main rashtriya kalege main pravesh liya
 It was only here that i began to think, think, and criticize liberally about all religious problems - even the existence of God
 par abhi bhi main pakkaa aastik tha
 Till that time i had long hair
 yadhyapi mujhe kabhi-bhi sikh yaa anya dharmon kii puranikta or siddhanton main vishwaas na ho sakaa tha
 But i had strong faith in the existence of God
 baad main main krantikari party se judaa
 The first leader i met there could not have dared to deny the existence of God even though he had no firm faith
 ishwar ke bare main mere hath purvak poochhate rahane par ve kehete, 'jab ichha ho, tab puja kar liya karo
 'this is atheism, which lacks courage
 duusare netaa, jinke main sampark main aayaa, pakke shraddhalu aadarneey kamred shacheendra nath sanyaal aajkal kakori shadyantra cese ke silsile main aaajeevan kaarvaas bhoga rahe hai
 His book 'bandi Jeevan' is a loud anthem of the glory of God
 unhone usamen ishwar ke upar prashansa ke pushp rahasyatmak veydant ke kaaran barasaaye hai
 The 'revolutionary' (revolutionary) form that was distributed across India on January 28, 1925, is the result of his intellectual labor
 usamen sarvashaktimaan or uski lila or kaaryon kii prashansa kii gai he
 My mistrust of God did not even arise in the revolutionary party

 i saw only one person among them who never prayed and said, "philosophy arises due to the weakness of man or limited knowledge
" vah bhi aaajeevan nirvaasan kii sajaa bhoga rahaa he
 But he too never dared to deny the existence of God
 is samay tak main keval ek romantic adarshavaadi krantikari tha
 Till now we used to follow others
 ab apane kandhon par zimmedaari uthaane kaa samay aayaa tha
 This was a defining point in my revolutionary life
 ‘adhyayan’ kii pukaar mere man ke galiyaaron main gunj rahi thi– virodhiyon dwaara rakhe gayi tarkon kaa saamana karne yogya banane ke liye adhyayan karo
 Read to be able to argue in favor of your opinion
 maine padhanaa shuru kar diya
 This refined my old thoughts and beliefs wonderfully
 romance kii jagah gambheer vichaaron ne le lee, na or adhik rahasyavaad, na hi andhvishwaas
 Realism became our basis
 mujhe vishvakranti ke anek aadarshon ke bare main padhane kaa khub mauka mila
 i read Buchanin, the anarchist leader, Marx, the father of communism, but more Lenin, Tratsky, and others who successfully brought revolution in their country
 ye sabhi naastik the
 Later i got the book 'sahaj Gyan' by Niralamb Swami
 isamen rahasywaadee naastikta thi
 By the end of 1926, i was convinced that the talk of an almighty supreme soul, who created, guided and operated the universe, is a blatant nonsense
 maine apane is avishvaas ko pradarshit kiya
 i debated this topic with my friends
 main ek ghoshit naastik ho chukaa tha
 In May 1927 i was arrested in Lahore
 railway police hawalat main mujhe ek maheenaa kaatna padaa
 The police officers told me that i was in Lucknow when the Kakori team was under trial, that i had talked about some plan to get them released, that we had obtained some bombs after getting their consent, that in 1927 Dussehra On the occasion of one of those bombs was thrown at the crowd for testing, that if i make a statement highlighting the activities of the revolutionary party, i will not be arrested and To the contrary will be i will be released without presenting the informant in court and reward

 From the same day, some police officers started luring me to praise God both times by the rule
 par ab main ek naastik tha
 i wanted to decide for myself whether in the days of peace and joy, i boast of being an atheist or even in such difficult times, i can stick to those principles
 bahut sochane ke baad maine nishchay kiya ki kisi bhi tarah ishwar par vishwaas or prarthana main nahin kar saktaa
 No, i did not do it even for a moment
 yahi asli pareekshan tha or main safal rahaa
 Now i was a firm believer and have been consistent ever since
 is pareekshan par khara utarana aasaan kaam na tha
 'faith' lightens the sufferings
 yahaan tak ki unhen sukhkar bana saktaa he
 In God, a base can be found that is extremely comforting to man
 uske bina manushya ko apane upar nirbhar karnaa padataa he
 Standing on your feet between the storm and the storm is not a child's play
 pariksha kii in ghadiyon main ahankaar yadi he, to bhaap ban kar ud jaataa he or manushya apane vishwaas ko thukaraane kaa saahas nahin kar paata
 If it does, then it leads to the conclusion that it has no other power but just ego
 aaj bilkul waisi hi sthiti he
 The full address of the decision is
 ek saptaah ke andar hi yah ghoshit ho jaayegaa ki main apana jivan ek dhyey par nyochaavar karne ja rahaa hum
 Apart from this idea, what else could be the consolation? ishwar main vishwaas rakhane vaala hindu punarjanm par raja hone kii aashaa kar saktaa he
 a Muslim or Christian can imagine the joy of prosperity in heaven and the rewards for their sufferings and sacrifices
 kintu main kya aashaa karun? main jaanata hum ki jis kshan rassi kaa fanda meri gardan par lagegaa or mere pairon ke neeche se takhta hatega, vah purna viraam hoga– vah antim kshan hoga
 i or my soul will all end there
 aage kuch na rahegaa
 a small battling life, which has no such glorious culmination, will be an award in itself - if i have the courage to see it from this point of view
 bina kisi swaarth ke yahaan yaa yahaan ke baad puraskaar kii ichha ke bina, maine anasakt bhav se apane jivan ko swatantrata ke dhyey par samarpit kar diya he, kyonki main or kuch kar hi nahin saktaa tha
 The day we will find many men and women of this mentality, who cannot devote their lives to anything other than the service of man and the salvation of the suffering humanity, the same day will be the beginning of the era of liberation
 ve shoshakon, utpeedakon or atyaachaariyon ko chunauti dene ke liye utprerit honge
 Not because he has to become king or get any other award here or in next life or after death in heaven
 unhen to maanavtaa kii gardan se daastaa kaa jua utaar phenkane or mukti evam shaanti sthapit karne ke liye is maarg ko apnaanaa hoga
 Will they walk the path that is dangerous for them but the only imaginable path for their great soul
 kya is mahaan dhyey ke prati unke garv ko ahankaar kahkar uskaa galat arth lagaaya jaayegaa? koun is prakaar ke ghrunit visheshan bolne kaa saahas karegaa? yaa to vah murkh he yaa dhoort
 We need to forgive him, because he cannot feel the high thoughts, feelings, impulses and their depths that are instilled in that heart
 uskaa hriday maance ke ek tukade kii tarah mrit he
 Her eyes are weakened by the shadow of the phantoms of other interests
 swayan par bharosa rakhane ke gun ko sadaiv ahankaar kii sangya di ja sakati he
 It is painful and annoying, but what is the choice? aalochana or swatantra vichaar ek krantikari ke donon anivaary gun hai
 Because our ancestors had built faith in some supreme soul
 atah koi bhi vyakti jo us vishwaas ko satyata yaa us param aatma ke astitv ko hi chunauti de, usko vidharmee, vishwasghaatee kaha jaayegaa
 If his arguments are so irrefutable that he cannot be rebutted by reason and his faith is so strong that he cannot be suppressed by showing fear of the plagues caused by the wrath of God, then he will be reprimanded by saying that he is boisterous
 yah meraa ahankaar nahin tha, jo mujhe naastikta kii ore le gaya
 The way my reasoning proves to be satisfactory is to be decided by my readers, not me
 main jaanata hum ki ishwar par vishwaas ne aaj meraa jivan aasaan or meraa boj halakaa kar diya hota
 My mistrust of him has made the whole atmosphere very dry
 thodaa-sa rahasyavaad ise kavitvamay bana saktaa he
 But my fate does not need any frenzy
 main yathartwaadee hum
 i want victory over inner nature with the help of conscience
 is dhyey main main sadaiv safal nahin hua hum
 It is man's duty to try
 safalataa to sanyog or vaataavaran par nirbhar he
 Someone who is a bit rational, would try to understand their environment logically
 jahaan sidhaa pramaan nahin he, vahaan darshan shaastra kaa mahatv he
 When our ancestors tried to understand the mystery of the world, its past, present and future, its why and where at the time of leisure, every person in the difficult lack of direct results solved these questions in their own way
 yahi kaaran he ki vibhinn dharmik maton main hamako itnaa antar miltaa he, jo kabhi-kabhi vaimnasy or jhagade kaa rup le letaa he
 Not only are there differences in views of East and West, but each hemisphere has differences among its different views
 purv ke dharmon main, islam or hindu dharm main zaraa bhi anurupata nahin he
 In India itself, Buddhism and Jainism are very different from Brahmanism, in which opposing opinions like Arya Samaj and Sanatan Dharma are found
 puraane samay kaa ek swatantra vichaarak charvak he
 He challenged God in the old times itself
 har vyakti apane ko sahi maanata he
 It is unfortunate that instead of the old thinkers' experiences and ideas as the basis of the fight against ignorance in the future, we, like slackers, continue to shout the unwavering and unshakeable faith in the statement of what we have proved and The types are guilty of rooting the development of humanity
 sirf vishwaas or andh vishwaas khataranaak he
 It makes the brain dumb and human reactionary
 jo manushya apane ko yathartwaadee hone kaa daawa karata he, use samast pracheen rudhigat vishwaason ko chunauti deni hogi
 The prevailing opinion has to be tested on the basis of logic
 yadi ve tark kaa prahaar na sah sake, to tukade-tukade hokar gir padegaa
 Then to establish the new philosophy, to make them completely dashed, to clear the place and to reconstruct using some things of the old beliefs
 main pracheen vishwaason ke thospan par prashn karne ke sambandh main aashwast hum
 i firmly believe that a conscious supreme soul, who guides and guides the movement of nature, has no existence
 ham prakruti main vishwaas karte hai or samast pragatisheel aandolan kaa dhyey manushya dwaara apni seva ke liye prakruti par vijay praapt karnaa maanate hai
 There is no conscious power behind this direction
 yahi hamaara darshan he
 We want to ask the believers some questions
 yadi aapkaa vishwaas he ki ek sarvashaktimaan, sarvavyaapak or sarvagyani ishwar he, jisane vishwa kii rachana kii, to krupa karke mujhe yah bataayen ki usne yah rachana kyon kii? kashton or santapon se purna duniya – asankhya dukhon ke shaashvat anant gathbandhanon se grasit! ek bhi vyakti to puri tarah santrusht nahi he
 Please do not say that this is his rule
 yadi vah kisi niyam se bandhaa he to vah sarvashaktimaan nahin he
 He is also a slave to rules like us
 krupa karke yah bhi na kahen ki yah uskaa manoranjan he
 Nero had just lit a romp
 usne bahut thodi sankhya main logon kii hatya kii thi
 He caused very little sorrow for his complete entertainment
 or uskaa itihaas main kya sthaan he? use itihaaskaar kis naam se bulaate hai? sabhi vifaille visheshan us par barasaaye jate hai
 The pages are blackened by his blasphemous sentences, condemning Nero as a heartless, fearless, wicked
 ek changez khan ne apane anand ke liye kuch hajaar jaane le leen or aaj ham uske naam se ghrinaa karte hai
 Then how do you justify your god? To the eternal Nero, who has been, and still continues to give, every day, every hour, and every minute, innumerable miseries
 phir tum kaise uske dushkarmon kaa paksh lene kii sochate ho, jo changez khan se prayek kshan adhik he? kya yah sab baad main in nirdosh ksht sahane waalon ko puraskaar or galati karne waalon ko dand dene ke liye ho rahaa he? thik he, thik he
 How long will you justify the person, who dares to inflict wounds on our body, because later, he will apply soft and comfortable ointments? gladator sanstha ke vyavasthaapak kahaan tak uchit karte the ki ek bhukhe khoonkhaar sher ke saamne manushya ko phenk do ki, yadi vah usase jaan bachaa letaa he, to uski khub dekhbhaal kii jaayegi? isaliye main poochta hum ki us chetan param aatma ne is vishwa or usamen manushyon kii rachana kyon kii? anand luutane ke liye? tab usamen or nero main kya fark he? You Muslims and Christians! You do not believe in past lives
 tum to hinduon kii tarah yah tark pesh nahin kar sakate ki pratyakshtah nirdosh vyaktiyon ke ksht unke purvajanmon ke karmon kaa fal he
 i ask you, why did that Almighty work for six days for the creation of the world by word? And why does he say every day that everything is fine? Call him today
 use pichhlaa itihaas dikhaao
 Let him study today's conditions
 ham dekhenge ki kya vah kehane kaa saahas karata he ki sab thik he
 From imprisonment to slums to slum settlements to millions of starving humans, to exploited laborers who are patiently watching bloodshed by capitalist vampires patiently and watching the waste of manpower that anyone sees Even the person, who has little knowledge, will tremble with fear, and instead of distributing more production to the needy people in the sea To throw it better, to the palaces of the kings whose foundations lay on the bones of human beings - let him see it all and then say - everything is fine! Why and from where? This is my question
 tum chup ho
 Okay, then i go ahead
 or tum hinduon, tum kehete ho ki aaj jo ksht bhoga rahe hai, ye purvajanm ke paapi hai or aaj ke utpeedak pichley janmon main sadhu purush the, atah ve satta kaa anand lut rahe hai
 i have to admit that your ancestors were very clever people
 unhone aise siddhanth gadhe, jinamein tark or avishvaas ke sabhi prayaason ko vifal karne kii kaafii takat he
 According to jurisprudence, punishment can be justified for only three reasons depending on the effect it has on the offender
 ve hai – pratikaar, bhay or sudhaar
 Today the theory of retaliation is condemned by all progressive thinkers
 bhaybheet karne ke siddhanth kaa bhi ant vahiin he
 The principle of reform is only necessary and is essential for the progress of humanity
 iskaa dhyey apradhi ko yogya or shantipriy naagarik ke rup main samaaj ko lautaanaa he
 But even if we consider human beings to be criminals, what is the nature of punishment given to them by God? You say that he produces them by making cows, cats, trees, herbs or animals
 tum aise 84 lakh dandon ko ginate ho
 i ask what effect he has on humans as reformers? How many people have you met who say that they were born as donkeys in a past life due to some sin? not even one? Do not give examples from your Puranas
 mere paas tumhaari puranic kathaon ke liye koi sthaan nahin he
 And then do you know that the biggest sin in the world is to be poor
 garibi ek abhishaap he
 This is a punishment
 main poochta hum ki dand prakriya kii kahaan tak prashansa karen, jo anivarytah manushya ko or adhik aparaadh karne ko baadhya kare? kya tumhaare ishwar ne yah nahin sochaa tha yaa usko bhi ye sari baaten maanavtaa dwaara akathaneey kashton ke jhelane kii keemat par anubhav se seekhni thim? tum kya sochate ho, kisi garib yaa anpadh parivaar, jaise ek chamaar yaa mehtar ke yahaan paidaa hone par insaan kaa kya bhagya hoga? chunki vah garib he, isaliye padhai nahin kar saktaa
 He remains despised and abandoned by his peers, who consider themselves elevated due to being born into an upper caste
 uskaa agyaan, uski garibi or usase kiya gaya vyavhaar uske hriday ko samaaj ke prati nishthur bana dete hai
 If he commits a sin, who will bear the consequences? Ishwar, he himself or the saint of society? And what about the punishments of those whom the arrogant Brahmins deliberately kept ignorant and who had to bear the punishment of having to bear a stream of melted lead in their ears because of listening to some sentences of your sacred books of knowledge - the Vedas? If they commit a crime, who will be responsible for it? And who will bear their blow? mere priy doston! ye siddhanth visheshadhikaar yukt logon ke avishkaar hai
 They justify their captured power, capital and highness on the basis of these principles
 aptaan singhlair ne likhaa tha ki manushya ko bas amartv main vishwaas dilaa do or uske baad uski sari sampatti lut lo
 He will help you in this task without raving
 dharm ke upadeshkon or satta ke swaamiyon ke gathbandhan se hi jail, faansee, kode or ye siddhanth upajte hai
 i ask, why doesn't your all-powerful God stop every person when he is committing a sin or a crime? He can do this very easily
 usne kyon nahin ladaaku raajaaon kii ladane kii ugrata ko samaapt kiya or is prakaar vishwayuddh dwaara maanavtaa par padane vaali vipattiyon se use bachaaya? usne angrejon ke mastishk main bharat ko mukt kar dene kii bhaavana kyon nahin paidaa kii? vah kyon nahin puunjipatiyon ke hriday main yah paropkaaree utsaah bhar detaa ki ve utpaadan ke sadhano par apana vyaktigat sampatti kaa adhikaar tyaag den or is prakaar keval sampoorn shramik samudaay, varan samast maanav samaaj ko poonjivadi bediyon se mukt karen? aap samaajwaad kii vyaavhaarikta par tark karnaa chaahate hai
 i leave it to your almighty to enforce it
 jahaan tak saamaanya bhalaai kii baat he, log samaajwaad ke gunon ko maanate hai
 They oppose it with an excuse of not being practical
 paramatma ko aane do or vah cheez ko sahi tareeke se kar de
 The British rule here is not because God wants but because he has power and we do not have the courage to oppose him
 ve hamako apane prabhutv main ishwar kii madad se nahin rakhe hai, balki banduukon, riflon, bam or goliyon, police or sena ke sahare
 It is our apathy that they are successfully committing the most disgraceful crime against society - complete exploitation of one nation by another
 kahaan he ishwar? kya vah manushya jati ke in kashton kaa mazaa le rahaa he? ek nero, ek changez, uskaa naash ho! Do you ask me how do i explain the origin of this world and the origin of man? Ok let me tell you
 chalrs darvin ne is vishay par kuch prakaash daalane kii koshish kii he
 Read it yah ek prakruti kii ghatana he
 Earth formed by accidental mixing of various substances, in the shape of a nebula
 kab? itihaas dekho
 Animals were born from this type of phenomenon and humans in a long period
 darwin kii ‘jeev kii utpatti’ padho
 And then all the development was done by man's constant opposition to nature and the desire to conquer it
 yah is ghatana kii sambhavtah sabase sookshm vyakhya he
 Your second argument could be why a child is born blind or lame? Is it not the result of the work done in his previous birth? Biologists have found a scientific solution to this problem
 avashya hi tum ek or bachakaana prashn puch sakate ho
 If there is no God, then why did people believe in him? My answer is subtle and clear
 jis prakaar ve preton or dusht atmaaon main vishwaas karne lage
 The only difference is that belief in God is universal and philosophy is highly developed
 isaki utpatti kaa shrey un shoshakon kii pratibha ko he, jo paramatma ke astitv kaa upadesh dekar logon ko apane prabhutv main rakhana chaahate the or unase apni vishisht sthiti kaa adhikaar evam anumodan chaahate the
 All religions, sects, sects and other such institutions eventually become the supporters of ruthless and exploitative institutions, individuals and classes
 raja ke viruddh har vidroh har dharm main sadaiv hi paap rahaa he
 After recognizing man's limitations, understanding his weaknesses and demerits, he is tempted to face bravely at the time of examination, to face all the dangers with masculinity and to tie his eruption into prosperity and majesty
 Fantasy existence was created
 apane vyaktigat niyamon or abhibhavakeey udaartaa se purna ishwar kii badha-chadha kar kalpana evam chithran kiya gaya

 ai
 D
 ke varisht adheekshak shri newman ne kaha ki yadi maine vaisaa vaktavy nahin diya, to mujh par kakori cese se sambandhit vidroh chhedane ke shadyantra or dashahra updrav main krur hatyaon ke liye mukadmaa chalaane par baadhya honge or ki unke paas mujhe sajaa dilaane or faansee par latakavane ke liye uchit pramaan hai
 From the same day, some police officers started luring me to praise God both times by the rule
 par ab main ek naastik tha
 i wanted to decide for myself whether in the days of peace and joy, i boast of being an atheist or even in such difficult times, i can stick to those principles
 bahut sochane ke baad maine nishchay kiya ki kisi bhi tarah ishwar par vishwaas or prarthana main nahin kar saktaa
 No, i did not do it even for a moment
 yahi asli pareekshan tha or main safal rahaa
 Now i was a firm believer and have been consistent ever since
 is pareekshan par khara utarana aasaan kaam na tha
 'faith' lightens the sufferings
 yahaan tak ki unhen sukhkar bana saktaa he
 In God, a base can be found that is extremely comforting to man
 uske bina manushya ko apane upar nirbhar karnaa padataa he
 Standing on your feet between the storm and the storm is not a child's play
 pariksha kii in ghadiyon main ahankaar yadi he, to bhaap ban kar ud jaataa he or manushya apane vishwaas ko thukaraane kaa saahas nahin kar paata
 If it does, then it leads to the conclusion that it has no other power but just ego
 aaj bilkul waisi hi sthiti he
 The full address of the decision is
 ek saptaah ke andar hi yah ghoshit ho jaayegaa ki main apana jivan ek dhyey par nyochaavar karne ja rahaa hum
 Apart from this idea, what else could be the consolation? ishwar main vishwaas rakhane vaala hindu punarjanm par raja hone kii aashaa kar saktaa he
 a Muslim or Christian can imagine the joy of prosperity in heaven and the rewards for their sufferings and sacrifices
 kintu main kya aashaa karun? main jaanata hum ki jis kshan rassi kaa fanda meri gardan par lagegaa or mere pairon ke neeche se takhta hatega, vah purna viraam hoga– vah antim kshan hoga
 i or my soul will all end there
 aage kuch na rahegaa
 a small battling life, which has no such glorious culmination, will be an award in itself - if i have the courage to see it from this point of view
 bina kisi swaarth ke yahaan yaa yahaan ke baad puraskaar kii ichha ke bina, maine anasakt bhav se apane jivan ko swatantrata ke dhyey par samarpit kar diya he, kyonki main or kuch kar hi nahin saktaa tha
 The day we will find many men and women of this mentality, who cannot devote their lives to anything other than the service of man and the salvation of the suffering humanity, the same day will be the beginning of the era of liberation
 ve shoshakon, utpeedakon or atyaachaariyon ko chunauti dene ke liye utprerit honge
 Not because he has to become king or get any other award here or in next life or after death in heaven
 unhen to maanavtaa kii gardan se daastaa kaa jua utaar phenkane or mukti evam shaanti sthapit karne ke liye is maarg ko apnaanaa hoga
 Will they walk the path that is dangerous for them but the only imaginable path for their great soul
 kya is mahaan dhyey ke prati unke garv ko ahankaar kahkar uskaa galat arth lagaaya jaayegaa? koun is prakaar ke ghrunit visheshan bolne kaa saahas karegaa? yaa to vah murkh he yaa dhoort
 We need to forgive him, because he cannot feel the high thoughts, feelings, impulses and their depths that are instilled in that heart
 uskaa hriday maance ke ek tukade kii tarah mrit he
 Her eyes are weakened by the shadow of the phantoms of other interests
 swayan par bharosa rakhane ke gun ko sadaiv ahankaar kii sangya di ja sakati he
 It is painful and annoying, but what is the choice? aalochana or swatantra vichaar ek krantikari ke donon anivaary gun hai
 Because our ancestors had built faith in some supreme soul
 atah koi bhi vyakti jo us vishwaas ko satyata yaa us param aatma ke astitv ko hi chunauti de, usko vidharmee, vishwasghaatee kaha jaayegaa
 If his arguments are so irrefutable that he cannot be rebutted by reason and his faith is so strong that he cannot be suppressed by showing fear of the plagues caused by the wrath of God, then he will be reprimanded by saying that he is boisterous
 yah meraa ahankaar nahin tha, jo mujhe naastikta kii ore le gaya
 The way my reasoning proves to be satisfactory is to be decided by my readers, not me
 main jaanata hum ki ishwar par vishwaas ne aaj meraa jivan aasaan or meraa boj halakaa kar diya hota
 My mistrust of him has made the whole atmosphere very dry
 thodaa-sa rahasyavaad ise kavitvamay bana saktaa he
 But my fate does not need any frenzy
 main yathartwaadee hum
 i want victory over inner nature with the help of conscience
 is dhyey main main sadaiv safal nahin hua hum
 It is man's duty to try
 safalataa to sanyog or vaataavaran par nirbhar he
 Someone who is a bit rational, would try to understand their environment logically
 jahaan sidhaa pramaan nahin he, vahaan darshan shaastra kaa mahatv he
 When our ancestors tried to understand the mystery of the world, its past, present and future, its why and where at the time of leisure, every person in the difficult lack of direct results solved these questions in their own way
 yahi kaaran he ki vibhinn dharmik maton main hamako itnaa antar miltaa he, jo kabhi-kabhi vaimnasy or jhagade kaa rup le letaa he
 Not only are there differences in views of East and West, but each hemisphere has differences among its different views
 purv ke dharmon main, islam or hindu dharm main zaraa bhi anurupata nahin he
 In India itself, Buddhism and Jainism are very different from Brahmanism, in which opposing opinions like Arya Samaj and Sanatan Dharma are found
 puraane samay kaa ek swatantra vichaarak charvak he
 He challenged God in the old times itself
 har vyakti apane ko sahi maanata he
 It is unfortunate that instead of the old thinkers' experiences and ideas as the basis of the fight against ignorance in the future, we, like slackers, continue to shout the unwavering and unshakeable faith in the statement of what we have proved and The types are guilty of rooting the development of humanity
 sirf vishwaas or andh vishwaas khataranaak he
 It makes the brain dumb and human reactionary
 jo manushya apane ko yathartwaadee hone kaa daawa karata he, use samast pracheen rudhigat vishwaason ko chunauti deni hogi
 The prevailing opinion has to be tested on the basis of logic
 yadi ve tark kaa prahaar na sah sake, to tukade-tukade hokar gir padegaa
 Then to establish the new philosophy, to make them completely dashed, to clear the place and to reconstruct using some things of the old beliefs
 main pracheen vishwaason ke thospan par prashn karne ke sambandh main aashwast hum
 i firmly believe that a conscious supreme soul, who guides and guides the movement of nature, has no existence
 ham prakruti main vishwaas karte hai or samast pragatisheel aandolan kaa dhyey manushya dwaara apni seva ke liye prakruti par vijay praapt karnaa maanate hai
 There is no conscious power behind this direction
 yahi hamaara darshan he
 We want to ask the believers some questions
 yadi aapkaa vishwaas he ki ek sarvashaktimaan, sarvavyaapak or sarvagyani ishwar he, jisane vishwa kii rachana kii, to krupa karke mujhe yah bataayen ki usne yah rachana kyon kii? kashton or santapon se purna duniya – asankhya dukhon ke shaashvat anant gathbandhanon se grasit! ek bhi vyakti to puri tarah santrusht nahi he
 Please do not say that this is his rule
 yadi vah kisi niyam se bandhaa he to vah sarvashaktimaan nahin he
 He is also a slave to rules like us
 krupa karke yah bhi na kahen ki yah uskaa manoranjan he
 Nero had just lit a romp
 usne bahut thodi sankhya main logon kii hatya kii thi
 He caused very little sorrow for his complete entertainment
 or uskaa itihaas main kya sthaan he? use itihaaskaar kis naam se bulaate hai? sabhi vifaille visheshan us par barasaaye jate hai
 The pages are blackened by his blasphemous sentences, denouncing - Nero a heartless, merciless, wicked
 ek changez khan ne apane anand ke liye kuch hajaar jaane le leen or aaj ham uske naam se ghrinaa karte hai
 Then how do you justify your god? To the eternal Nero, who has been, and still continues to give, every day, every hour, and every minute, innumerable miseries
 phir tum kaise uske dushkarmon kaa paksh lene kii sochate ho, jo changez khan se prayek kshan adhik he? kya yah sab baad main in nirdosh ksht sahane waalon ko puraskaar or galati karne waalon ko dand dene ke liye ho rahaa he? thik he, thik he
 How long will you justify the person, who dares to inflict wounds on our body, because later, he will apply soft and comfortable ointments? gladator sanstha ke vyavasthaapak kahaan tak uchit karte the ki ek bhukhe khoonkhaar sher ke saamne manushya ko phenk do ki, yadi vah usase jaan bachaa letaa he, to uski khub dekhbhaal kii jaayegi? isaliye main poochta hum ki us chetan param aatma ne is vishwa or usamen manushyon kii rachana kyon kii? anand luutane ke liye? tab usamen or nero main kya fark he? You Muslims and Christians! You do not believe in past lives
 tum to hinduon kii tarah yah tark pesh nahin kar sakate ki pratyakshtah nirdosh vyaktiyon ke ksht unke purvajanmon ke karmon kaa fal he
 i ask you, why did that Almighty work for six days for the creation of the world by word? And why does he say every day that everything is fine? Call him today
 use pichhlaa itihaas dikhaao
 Let him study today's conditions
 ham dekhenge ki kya vah kehane kaa saahas karata he ki sab thik he
 From imprisonment to slums to slum settlements to millions of starving humans, to exploited laborers who are patiently watching bloodshed by capitalist vampires patiently and watching the waste of manpower that anyone sees Even the person, who has little knowledge, will tremble with fear, and instead of distributing more production to the needy people in the sea To throw it better, to the palaces of the kings whose foundations lay on the bones of human beings - let him see it all and then say - everything is fine! Why and from where? This is my question
 tum chup ho
 Okay, then i go ahead
 or tum hinduon, tum kehete ho ki aaj jo ksht bhoga rahe hai, ye purvajanm ke paapi hai or aaj ke utpeedak pichley janmon main sadhu purush the, atah ve satta kaa anand lut rahe hai
 i have to admit that your ancestors were very clever people
 unhone aise siddhanth gadhe, jinamein tark or avishvaas ke sabhi prayaason ko vifal karne kii kaafii takat he
 According to jurisprudence, punishment can be justified for only three reasons depending on the effect it has on the offender
 ve hai – pratikaar, bhay or sudhaar
 Today the theory of retaliation is condemned by all progressive thinkers
 bhaybheet karne ke siddhanth kaa bhi ant vahiin he
 The principle of reform is only necessary and is essential for the progress of humanity
 iskaa dhyey apradhi ko yogya or shantipriy naagarik ke rup main samaaj ko lautaanaa he
 But even if we consider human beings to be criminals, what is the nature of punishment given to them by God? You say that he produces them by making cows, cats, trees, herbs or animals
 tum aise 84 lakh dandon ko ginate ho
 i ask what effect he has on humans as reformers? How many people have you met who say that they were born as donkeys in a past life due to some sin? not even one? Do not give examples from your Puranas
 mere paas tumhaari puranic kathaon ke liye koi sthaan nahin he
 And then do you know that the biggest sin in the world is to be poor
 garibi ek abhishaap he
 This is a punishment
 main poochta hum ki dand prakriya kii kahaan tak prashansa karen, jo anivarytah manushya ko or adhik aparaadh karne ko baadhya kare? kya tumhaare ishwar ne yah nahin sochaa tha yaa usko bhi ye sari baaten maanavtaa dwaara akathaneey kashton ke jhelane kii keemat par anubhav se seekhni thim? tum kya sochate ho, kisi garib yaa anpadh parivaar, jaise ek chamaar yaa mehtar ke yahaan paidaa hone par insaan kaa kya bhagya hoga? chunki vah garib he, isaliye padhai nahin kar saktaa
 He remains despised and abandoned by his peers, who consider themselves elevated due to being born into an upper caste
 uskaa agyaan, uski garibi or usase kiya gaya vyavhaar uske hriday ko samaaj ke prati nishthur bana dete hai
 If he commits a sin, who will bear the consequences? Ishwar, he himself or the saint of society? And what about the punishments of those whom the arrogant Brahmins deliberately kept ignorant and who had to bear the punishment of having to bear a stream of melted lead in their ears because of listening to some sentences of your sacred books of knowledge - the Vedas? If they commit a crime, who will be responsible for it? And who will bear their blow? mere priy doston! ye siddhanth visheshadhikaar yukt logon ke avishkaar hai
 They justify their captured power, capital and highness on the basis of these principles
 aptaan singhlair ne likhaa tha ki manushya ko bas amartv main vishwaas dilaa do or uske baad uski sari sampatti lut lo
 He will help you in this task without raving
 dharm ke upadeshkon or satta ke swaamiyon ke gathbandhan se hi jail, faansee, kode or ye siddhanth upajte hai
 i ask, why doesn't your all-powerful God stop every person when he is committing a sin or a crime? He can do this very easily
 usne kyon nahin ladaaku raajaaon kii ladane kii ugrata ko samaapt kiya or is prakaar vishwayuddh dwaara maanavtaa par padane vaali vipattiyon se use bachaaya? usne angrejon ke mastishk main bharat ko mukt kar dene kii bhaavana kyon nahin paidaa kii? vah kyon nahin puunjipatiyon ke hriday main yah paropkaaree utsaah bhar detaa ki ve utpaadan ke sadhano par apana vyaktigat sampatti kaa adhikaar tyaag den or is prakaar keval sampoorn shramik samudaay, varan samast maanav samaaj ko poonjivadi bediyon se mukt karen? aap samaajwaad kii vyaavhaarikta par tark karnaa chaahate hai
 i leave it to your almighty to enforce it
 jahaan tak saamaanya bhalaai kii baat he, log samaajwaad ke gunon ko maanate hai
 They oppose it with an excuse of not being practical
 paramatma ko aane do or vah cheez ko sahi tareeke se kar de
 The British rule here is not because God wants but because he has power and we do not have the courage to oppose him
 ve hamako apane prabhutv main ishwar kii madad se nahin rakhe hai, balki banduukon, riflon, bam or goliyon, police or sena ke sahare
 It is our apathy that they are successfully committing the most disgraceful crime against society - complete exploitation of one nation by another
 kahaan he ishwar? kya vah manushya jati ke in kashton kaa mazaa le rahaa he? ek nero, ek changez, uskaa naash ho! Do you ask me how do i explain the origin of this world and the origin of man? Ok let me tell you
 chalrs darvin ne is vishay par kuch prakaash daalane kii koshish kii he
 Read it yah ek prakruti kii ghatana he
 Earth formed by accidental mixing of various substances, in the shape of a nebula
 kab? itihaas dekho
 Animals were born from this type of phenomenon and humans in a long period
 darwin kii ‘jeev kii utpatti’ padho
 And then all the development was done by man's constant opposition to nature and the desire to conquer it
 yah is ghatana kii sambhavtah sabase sookshm vyakhya he
 Your second argument could be why a child is born blind or lame? Is it not the result of the work done in his previous birth? Biologists have found a scientific solution to this problem
 avashya hi tum ek or bachakaana prashn puch sakate ho
 If there is no God, then why did people believe in him? My answer is subtle and clear
 jis prakaar ve preton or dusht atmaaon main vishwaas karne lage
 The only difference is that belief in God is universal and philosophy is highly developed
 isaki utpatti kaa shrey un shoshakon kii pratibha ko he, jo paramatma ke astitv kaa upadesh dekar logon ko apane prabhutv main rakhana chaahate the or unase apni vishisht sthiti kaa adhikaar evam anumodan chaahate the
 All religions, sects, sects and other such institutions eventually become the supporters of ruthless and exploitative institutions, individuals and classes
 raja ke viruddh har vidroh har dharm main sadaiv hi paap rahaa he
 After recognizing man's limitations, understanding his weaknesses and demerits, he is tempted to face bravely at the time of examination, to face all the dangers with masculinity and to tie his eruption into prosperity and majesty
 Fantasy existence was created
 apane vyaktigat niyamon or abhibhavakeey udaartaa se purna ishwar kii badha-chadha kar kalpana evam chithran kiya gaya
 He is used as a fear-monger when he discusses his rage and personal rules
 taaki koi manushya samaaj ke liye khatara na ban jaye
 When his guardian qualities are explained, he is used as a father, mother, brother, sister, friend and helper
 jab manushya apane sabhi doston dwaara vishwasghaat or tyaag dene se atyant klesh main ho, tab use is vichaar se santvana mil sakati he ki ek sadaa sachcha dost uski sahaayta karne ko he, usko sahaara degaa or vah sarvashaktimaan he or kuch bhi kar saktaa he
 In fact it was useful for the society in the primitive period
 pidaa main pade manushya ke liye ishwar kii kalpana upyogi hoti he
 Society has to fight against this belief
 manushya jab apane pairon par khadaa hone kaa prayaas karata he or yathartwaadee ban jaataa he, tab use shraddha ko ek ore phenk dena chahie or un sabhi kashton, pareshaaniyon kaa purushatv ke saath saamana karnaa chahie, jinamein paristhitiyaan use patake sakati hai
 This is my position today

 Let him study today's conditions
 ham dekhenge ki kya vah kehane kaa saahas karata he ki sab thik he
 From imprisonment to slums to slum settlements to millions of starving humans, to exploited laborers who are patiently watching bloodshed by capitalist vampires patiently and watching the waste of manpower that anyone sees Even the person, who has little knowledge, will tremble with fear, and instead of distributing more production to the needy people in the sea To throw it better, to the palaces of the kings whose foundations lay on the bones of human beings - let him see it all and then say - everything is fine! Why and from where? This is my question
 tum chup ho
 Okay, then i go ahead

 i have to admit that your ancestors were very clever people
 unhone aise siddhanth gadhe, jinamein tark or avishvaas ke sabhi prayaason ko vifal karne kii kaafii takat he
 According to jurisprudence, punishment can be justified for only three reasons depending on the effect it has on the offender
 ve hai – pratikaar, bhay or sudhaar
 Today the theory of retaliation is condemned by all progressive thinkers
 bhaybheet karne ke siddhanth kaa bhi ant vahiin he
 The principle of reform is only necessary and is essential for the progress of humanity
 iskaa dhyey apradhi ko yogya or shantipriy naagarik ke rup main samaaj ko lautaanaa he
 But even if we consider human beings to be criminals, what is the nature of punishment given to them by God? You say that he produces them by making cows, cats, trees, herbs or animals
 tum aise 84 lakh dandon ko ginate ho
 i ask what effect he has on humans as reformers? How many people have you met who say that they were born as donkeys in a past life due to some sin? not even one? Do not give examples from your Puranas

 This is a punishment
 main poochta hum ki dand prakriya kii kahaan tak prashansa karen, jo anivarytah manushya ko or adhik aparaadh karne ko baadhya kare? kya tumhaare ishwar ne yah nahin sochaa tha yaa usko bhi ye sari baaten maanavtaa dwaara akathaneey kashton ke jhelane kii keemat par anubhav se seekhni thim? tum kya sochate ho, kisi garib yaa anpadh parivaar, jaise ek chamaar yaa mehtar ke yahaan paidaa hone par insaan kaa kya bhagya hoga? chunki vah garib he, isaliye padhai nahin kar saktaa
 He remains despised and abandoned by his peers, who consider themselves elevated due to being born into an upper caste
 uskaa agyaan, uski garibi or usase kiya gaya vyavhaar uske hriday ko samaaj ke prati nishthur bana dete hai
 If he commits a sin, who will bear the consequences? Ishwar, he himself or the saint of society? And what about the punishments of those whom the arrogant Brahmins deliberately kept ignorant and who had to bear the punishment of having to bear a stream of melted lead in their ears because of listening to some sentences of your sacred books of knowledge - the Vedas? If they commit a crime, who will be responsible for it? And who will bear their blow? mere priy doston! ye siddhanth visheshadhikaar yukt logon ke avishkaar hai
 They justify their captured power, capital and highness on the basis of these principles
 aptaan singhlair ne likhaa tha ki manushya ko bas amartv main vishwaas dilaa do or uske baad uski sari sampatti lut lo
 He will help you in this task without raving
 dharm ke upadeshkon or satta ke swaamiyon ke gathbandhan se hi jail, faansee, kode or ye siddhanth upajte hai
 i ask, why doesn't your all-powerful God stop every person when he is committing a sin or a crime? He can do this very easily
 usne kyon nahin ladaaku raajaaon kii ladane kii ugrata ko samaapt kiya or is prakaar vishwayuddh dwaara maanavtaa par padane vaali vipattiyon se use bachaaya? usne angrejon ke mastishk main bharat ko mukt kar dene kii bhaavana kyon nahin paidaa kii? vah kyon nahin puunjipatiyon ke hriday main yah paropkaaree utsaah bhar detaa ki ve utpaadan ke sadhano par apana vyaktigat sampatti kaa adhikaar tyaag den or is prakaar keval sampoorn shramik samudaay, varan samast maanav samaaj ko poonjivadi bediyon se mukt karen? aap samaajwaad kii vyaavhaarikta par tark karnaa chaahate hai
 i leave it to your almighty to enforce it
 jahaan tak saamaanya bhalaai kii baat he, log samaajwaad ke gunon ko maanate hai
 They oppose it with an excuse of not being practical
 paramatma ko aane do or vah cheez ko sahi tareeke se kar de
 The British rule here is not because God wants but because he has power and we do not have the courage to oppose him
 ve hamako apane prabhutv main ishwar kii madad se nahin rakhe hai, balki banduukon, riflon, bam or goliyon, police or sena ke sahare
 It is our apathy that they are successfully committing the most disgraceful crime against society - complete exploitation of one nation by another
 kahaan he ishwar? kya vah manushya jati ke in kashton kaa mazaa le rahaa he? ek nero, ek changez, uskaa naash ho! Do you ask me how do i explain the origin of this world and the origin of man? Ok let me tell you
 chalrs darvin ne is vishay par kuch prakaash daalane kii koshish kii he
 Read it yah ek prakruti kii ghatana he
 Earth formed by accidental mixing of various substances, in the shape of a nebula
 kab? itihaas dekho
 Animals were born from this type of phenomenon and humans in a long period
 darwin kii ‘jeev kii utpatti’ padho
 And then all the development was done by man's constant opposition to nature and the desire to conquer it
 yah is ghatana kii sambhavtah sabase sookshm vyakhya he
 Your second argument could be why a child is born blind or lame? Is it not the result of the work done in his previous birth? Biologists have found a scientific solution to this problem
 avashya hi tum ek or bachakaana prashn puch sakate ho
 If there is no God, then why did people believe in him? My answer is subtle and clear
 jis prakaar ve preton or dusht atmaaon main vishwaas karne lage
 The only difference is that belief in God is universal and philosophy is highly developed
 isaki utpatti kaa shrey un shoshakon kii pratibha ko he, jo paramatma ke astitv kaa upadesh dekar logon ko apane prabhutv main rakhana chaahate the or unase apni vishisht sthiti kaa adhikaar evam anumodan chaahate the
 All religions, sects, sects and other such institutions eventually become the supporters of ruthless and exploitative institutions, individuals and classes
 raja ke viruddh har vidroh har dharm main sadaiv hi paap rahaa he
 After recognizing man's limitations, understanding his weaknesses and demerits, he is tempted to face bravely at the time of examination, to face all the dangers with masculinity and to tie his eruption into prosperity and majesty
 Fantasy existence was created
 apane vyaktigat niyamon or abhibhavakeey udaartaa se purna ishwar kii badha-chadha kar kalpana evam chithran kiya gaya
 He is used as a fear-monger when he discusses his rage and personal rules
 taaki koi manushya samaaj ke liye khatara na ban jaye
 When his guardian qualities are explained, he is used as a father, mother, brother, sister, friend and helper
 jab manushya apane sabhi doston dwaara vishwasghaat or tyaag dene se atyant klesh main ho, tab use is vichaar se santvana mil sakati he ki ek sadaa sachcha dost uski sahaayta karne ko he, usko sahaara degaa or vah sarvashaktimaan he or kuch bhi kar saktaa he
 In fact it was useful for the society in the primitive period
 pidaa main pade manushya ke liye ishwar kii kalpana upyogi hoti he
 Society has to fight against this belief
 manushya jab apane pairon par khadaa hone kaa prayaas karata he or yathartwaadee ban jaataa he, tab use shraddha ko ek ore phenk dena chahie or un sabhi kashton, pareshaaniyon kaa purushatv ke saath saamana karnaa chahie, jinamein paristhitiyaan use patake sakati hai
 This is my position today

 The police officers told me that i was in Lucknow when the Kakori team was under trial, that i had talked about some plan to get them released, that we had obtained some bombs after getting their consent, that in 1927 Dussehra On the occasion of one of those bombs was thrown at the crowd for testing, that if i make a statement highlighting the activities of the revolutionary party, i will not be arrested and To the contrary will be i will be released without presenting the informant in court and reward

 From the same day, some police officers started luring me to praise God both times by the rule

 tum to hinduon kii tarah yah tark pesh nahin kar sakate ki pratyakshtah nirdosh vyaktiyon ke ksht unke purvajanmon ke karmon kaa fal he
 i ask you, why did that Almighty work for six days for the creation of the world by word? And why does he say every day that everything is fine? Call him today
 use pichhlaa itihaas dikhaao
 Let him study today's conditions
 ham dekhenge ki kya vah kehane kaa saahas karata he ki sab thik he
 From imprisonment to slums to slum settlements to millions of starving humans, to exploited laborers who are patiently watching bloodshed by capitalist vampires patiently and watching the waste of manpower that anyone sees Even the person, who has little knowledge, will tremble with fear, and instead of distributing more production to the needy people in the sea To throw it better, to the palaces of the kings whose foundations lay on the bones of human beings - let him see it all and then say - everything is fine! Why and from where? This is my question
 tum chup ho
 Okay, then i go ahead
 or tum hinduon, tum kehete ho ki aaj jo ksht bhoga rahe hai, ye purvajanm ke paapi hai or aaj ke utpeedak pichley janmon main sadhu purush the, atah ve satta kaa anand lut rahe hai
 i have to admit that your ancestors were very clever people
 unhone aise siddhanth gadhe, jinamein tark or avishvaas ke sabhi prayaason ko vifal karne kii kaafii takat he
 According to jurisprudence, punishment can be justified for only three reasons depending on the effect it has on the offender
 ve hai – pratikaar, bhay or sudhaar
 Today the theory of retaliation is condemned by all progressive thinkers
 bhaybheet karne ke siddhanth kaa bhi ant vahiin he
 The principle of reform is only necessary and is essential for the progress of humanity
 iskaa dhyey apradhi ko yogya or shantipriy naagarik ke rup main samaaj ko lautaanaa he
 But even if we consider human beings to be criminals, what is the nature of punishment given to them by God? You say that he produces them by making cows, cats, trees, herbs or animals
 tum aise 84 lakh dandon ko ginate ho
 i ask what effect he has on humans as reformers? How many people have you met who say that they were born as donkeys in a past life due to some sin? not even one? Do not give examples from your Puranas
 mere paas tumhaari puranic kathaon ke liye koi sthaan nahin he
 And then do you know that the biggest sin in the world is to be poor
 garibi ek abhishaap he
 This is a punishment
 main poochta hum ki dand prakriya kii kahaan tak prashansa karen, jo anivarytah manushya ko or adhik aparaadh karne ko baadhya kare? kya tumhaare ishwar ne yah nahin sochaa tha yaa usko bhi ye sari baaten maanavtaa dwaara akathaneey kashton ke jhelane kii keemat par anubhav se seekhni thim? tum kya sochate ho, kisi garib yaa anpadh parivaar, jaise ek chamaar yaa mehtar ke yahaan paidaa hone par insaan kaa kya bhagya hoga? chunki vah garib he, isaliye padhai nahin kar saktaa
 He remains despised and abandoned by his peers, who consider themselves elevated due to being born into an upper caste
 uskaa agyaan, uski garibi or usase kiya gaya vyavhaar uske hriday ko samaaj ke prati nishthur bana dete hai
 If he commits a sin, who will bear the consequences? Ishwar, he himself or the saint of society? And what about the punishments of those whom the arrogant Brahmins deliberately kept ignorant and who had to bear the punishment of having to bear a stream of melted lead in their ears because of listening to some sentences of your sacred books of knowledge - the Vedas? If they commit a crime, who will be responsible for it? And who will bear their blow? mere priy doston! ye siddhanth visheshadhikaar yukt logon ke avishkaar hai
 They justify their captured power, capital and highness on the basis of these principles
 aptaan singhlair ne likhaa tha ki manushya ko bas amartv main vishwaas dilaa do or uske baad uski sari sampatti lut lo
 He will help you in this task without raving
 dharm ke upadeshkon or satta ke swaamiyon ke gathbandhan se hi jail, faansee, kode or ye siddhanth upajte hai
 i ask, why doesn't your all-powerful God stop every person when he is committing a sin or a crime? He can do this very easily
 usne kyon nahin ladaaku raajaaon kii ladane kii ugrata ko samaapt kiya or is prakaar vishwayuddh dwaara maanavtaa par padane vaali vipattiyon se use bachaaya? usne angrejon ke mastishk main bharat ko mukt kar dene kii bhaavana kyon nahin paidaa kii? vah kyon nahin puunjipatiyon ke hriday main yah paropkaaree utsaah bhar detaa ki ve utpaadan ke sadhano par apana vyaktigat sampatti kaa adhikaar tyaag den or is prakaar keval sampoorn shramik samudaay, varan samast maanav samaaj ko poonjivadi bediyon se mukt karen? aap samaajwaad kii vyaavhaarikta par tark karnaa chaahate hai
 i leave it to your almighty to enforce it
 jahaan tak saamaanya bhalaai kii baat he, log samaajwaad ke gunon ko maanate hai
 They oppose it with an excuse of not being practical
 paramatma ko aane do or vah cheez ko sahi tareeke se kar de
 The British rule here is not because God wants but because he has power and we do not have the courage to oppose him
 ve hamako apane prabhutv main ishwar kii madad se nahin rakhe hai, balki banduukon, riflon, bam or goliyon, police or sena ke sahare
 It is our apathy that they are successfully committing the most disgraceful crime against society - complete exploitation of one nation by another
 kahaan he ishwar? kya vah manushya jati ke in kashton kaa mazaa le rahaa he? ek nero, ek changez, uskaa naash ho! Do you ask me how do i explain the origin of this world and the origin of man? Ok let me tell you
 chalrs darvin ne is vishay par kuch prakaash daalane kii koshish kii he
 Read it yah ek prakruti kii ghatana he
 Earth formed by accidental mixing of various substances, in the shape of a nebula
 kab? itihaas dekho
 Animals were born from this type of phenomenon and humans in a long period
 darwin kii ‘jeev kii utpatti’ padho
 And then all the development was done by man's constant opposition to nature and the desire to conquer it
 yah is ghatana kii sambhavtah sabase sookshm vyakhya he
 Your second argument could be why a child is born blind or lame? Is it not the result of the work done in his previous birth? Biologists have found a scientific solution to this problem
 avashya hi tum ek or bachakaana prashn puch sakate ho
 If there is no God, then why did people believe in him? My answer is subtle and clear
 jis prakaar ve preton or dusht atmaaon main vishwaas karne lage
 The only difference is that belief in God is universal and philosophy is highly developed
 isaki utpatti kaa shrey un shoshakon kii pratibha ko he, jo paramatma ke astitv kaa upadesh dekar logon ko apane prabhutv main rakhana chaahate the or unase apni vishisht sthiti kaa adhikaar evam anumodan chaahate the
 All religions, sects, sects and other such institutions eventually become the supporters of ruthless and exploitative institutions, individuals and classes
 raja ke viruddh har vidroh har dharm main sadaiv hi paap rahaa he
 After recognizing man's limitations, understanding his weaknesses and demerits, he is tempted to face bravely at the time of examination, to face all the dangers with masculinity and to tie his eruption into prosperity and majesty
 Fantasy existence was created
 apane vyaktigat niyamon or abhibhavakeey udaartaa se purna ishwar kii badha-chadha kar kalpana evam chithran kiya gaya
 He is used as a fear-monger when he discusses his rage and personal rules
 taaki koi manushya samaaj ke liye khatara na ban jaye
 When his guardian qualities are explained, he is used as a father, mother, brother, sister, friend and helper
 jab manushya apane sabhi doston dwaara vishwasghaat or tyaag dene se atyant klesh main ho, tab use is vichaar se santvana mil sakati he ki ek sadaa sachcha dost uski sahaayta karne ko he, usko sahaara degaa or vah sarvashaktimaan he or kuch bhi kar saktaa he
 In fact it was useful for the society in the primitive period
 pidaa main pade manushya ke liye ishwar kii kalpana upyogi hoti he
 Society has to fight against this belief
 manushya jab apane pairon par khadaa hone kaa prayaas karata he or yathartwaadee ban jaataa he, tab use shraddha ko ek ore phenk dena chahie or un sabhi kashton, pareshaaniyon kaa purushatv ke saath saamana karnaa chahie, jinamein paristhitiyaan use patake sakati hai
 This is my position today
 yah meraa ahankaar nahin he, mere dost! yah mere sochane kaa tarika he, jisane mujhe naastik banaaya he
 The comments ishwar main vishwaas or rose-ba-rose kii prarthana ko main manushya ke liye sabase swaarthee or gira hua kaam maanata hum
 i have read about the atheists who bravely faced all the calamities
 atah main bhi ek purush kii bhaanti faansee ke phande kii antim ghadi tak sir ooncha kiye khadaa rahanaa chahta hum
 We have to see how i manage
 mere ek dost ne mujhe prarthana karne ko kaha
 When i told him about being an atheist, he said, "in your last days you will start believing
" '’ maine kaha, ‘'nahin, pyaare dost, aisa nahin hoga
 i explain this to myself as degrading and corrupt
 swaarthee kaarnon se main prarthana nahin karuunga
 "readers and friends, is this arrogance?" If it is, i accept it
 is samay tak main keval ek romantic adarshavaadi krantikari tha
 Till now we used to follow others
 ab apane kandhon par zimmedaari uthaane kaa samay aayaa tha
 This was a defining point in my revolutionary life
 ‘adhyayan’ kii pukaar mere man ke galiyaaron main gunj rahi thi– virodhiyon dwaara rakhe gayi tarkon kaa saamana karne yogya banane ke liye adhyayan karo
 Read to be able to argue in favor of your opinion
 maine padhanaa shuru kar diya
 This refined my old thoughts and beliefs wonderfully
 romance kii jagah gambheer vichaaron ne le lee, na or adhik rahasyavaad, na hi andhvishwaas
 Realism became our basis
 mujhe vishvakranti ke anek aadarshon ke bare main padhane kaa khub mauka mila
 i read Buchanin, the anarchist leader, Marx, the father of communism, but more Lenin, Tratsky, and others who successfully brought revolution in their country
 ye sabhi naastik the
 Later i got the book 'sahaj Gyan' by Niralamb Swami
 isamen rahasywaadee naastikta thi
 By the end of 1926, i was convinced that the talk of an almighty supreme soul, who created, guided and operated the universe, is a blatant nonsense
 maine apane is avishvaas ko pradarshit kiya
 i debated this topic with my friends
 main ek ghoshit naastik ho chukaa tha
 In May 1927 i was arrested in Lahore
 railway police hawalat main mujhe ek maheenaa kaatna padaa
 The police officers told me that i was in Lucknow when the Kakori team was under trial, that i had talked about some plan to get them released, that we had obtained some bombs after getting their consent, that in 1927 Dussehra On the occasion of one of those bombs was thrown at the crowd for testing, that if i make a statement highlighting the activities of the revolutionary party, i will not be arrested and To the contrary will be i will be released without presenting the informant in court and reward
 main is prastaav par hansaa
 It was all useless
 ham logon kii bhaanti vichaar rakhane vaale apni nirdosh janata par bam nahin phenkaa karte
 One day in the morning c
 ai
 D
 ke varisht adheekshak shri newman ne kaha ki yadi maine vaisaa vaktavy nahin diya, to mujh par kakori cese se sambandhit vidroh chhedane ke shadyantra or dashahra updrav main krur hatyaon ke liye mukadmaa chalaane par baadhya honge or ki unke paas mujhe sajaa dilaane or faansee par latakavane ke liye uchit pramaan hai
 From the same day, some police officers started luring me to praise God both times by the rule
 par ab main ek naastik tha
 i wanted to decide for myself whether in the days of peace and joy, i boast of being an atheist or even in such difficult times, i can stick to those principles
 bahut sochane ke baad maine nishchay kiya ki kisi bhi tarah ishwar par vishwaas or prarthana main nahin kar saktaa
 No, i did not do it even for a moment
 yahi asli pareekshan tha or main safal rahaa
 Now i was a firm believer and have been consistent ever since
 is pareekshan par khara utarana aasaan kaam na tha
 'faith' lightens the sufferings
 yahaan tak ki unhen sukhkar bana saktaa he
 In God, a base can be found that is extremely comforting to man
 uske bina manushya ko apane upar nirbhar karnaa padataa he
 Standing on your feet between the storm and the storm is not a child's play
 pariksha kii in ghadiyon main ahankaar yadi he, to bhaap ban kar ud jaataa he or manushya apane vishwaas ko thukaraane kaa saahas nahin kar paata
 If it does, then it leads to the conclusion that it has no other power but just ego
 aaj bilkul waisi hi sthiti he
 The full address of the decision is
 ek saptaah ke andar hi yah ghoshit ho jaayegaa ki main apana jivan ek dhyey par nyochaavar karne ja rahaa hum
 Apart from this idea, what else could be the consolation? ishwar main vishwaas rakhane vaala hindu punarjanm par raja hone kii aashaa kar saktaa he
 a Muslim or Christian can imagine the joy of prosperity in heaven and the rewards for their sufferings and sacrifices
 kintu main kya aashaa karun? main jaanata hum ki jis kshan rassi kaa fanda meri gardan par lagegaa or mere pairon ke neeche se takhta hatega, vah purna viraam hoga– vah antim kshan hoga
 i or my soul will all end there
 aage kuch na rahegaa
 a small battling life, which has no such glorious culmination, will be an award in itself - if i have the courage to see it from this point of view
 bina kisi swaarth ke yahaan yaa yahaan ke baad puraskaar kii ichha ke bina, maine anasakt bhav se apane jivan ko swatantrata ke dhyey par samarpit kar diya he, kyonki main or kuch kar hi nahin saktaa tha
 The day we will find many men and women of this mentality, who cannot devote their lives to anything other than the service of man and the salvation of the suffering humanity, the same day will be the beginning of the era of liberation
 ve shoshakon, utpeedakon or atyaachaariyon ko chunauti dene ke liye utprerit honge
 Not because he has to become king or get any other award here or in next life or after death in heaven
 unhen to maanavtaa kii gardan se daastaa kaa jua utaar phenkane or mukti evam shaanti sthapit karne ke liye is maarg ko apnaanaa hoga
 Will they walk the path that is dangerous for them but the only imaginable path for their great soul
 kya is mahaan dhyey ke prati unke garv ko ahankaar kahkar uskaa galat arth lagaaya jaayegaa? koun is prakaar ke ghrunit visheshan bolne kaa saahas karegaa? yaa to vah murkh he yaa dhoort
 We need to forgive him, because he cannot feel the high thoughts, feelings, impulses and their depths that are instilled in that heart
 uskaa hriday maance ke ek tukade kii tarah mrit he
 Her eyes are weakened by the shadow of the phantoms of other interests
 swayan par bharosa rakhane ke gun ko sadaiv ahankaar kii sangya di ja sakati he
 It is painful and annoying, but what is the choice? aalochana or swatantra vichaar ek krantikari ke donon anivaary gun hai
 Because our ancestors had built faith in some supreme soul
 atah koi bhi vyakti jo us vishwaas ko satyata yaa us param aatma ke astitv ko hi chunauti de, usko vidharmee, vishwasghaatee kaha jaayegaa
 If his arguments are so irrefutable that he cannot be rebutted by reason and his faith is so strong that he cannot be suppressed by showing fear of the plagues caused by the wrath of God, then he will be reprimanded by saying that he is boisterous
 yah meraa ahankaar nahin tha, jo mujhe naastikta kii ore le gaya
 The way my reasoning proves to be satisfactory is to be decided by my readers, not me
 main jaanata hum ki ishwar par vishwaas ne aaj meraa jivan aasaan or meraa boj halakaa kar diya hota
 My mistrust of him has made the whole atmosphere very dry
 thodaa-sa rahasyavaad ise kavitvamay bana saktaa he
 But my fate does not need any frenzy
 main yathartwaadee hum
 i want victory over inner nature with the help of conscience
 is dhyey main main sadaiv safal nahin hua hum
 It is man's duty to try
 safalataa to sanyog or vaataavaran par nirbhar he
 Someone who is a bit rational, would try to understand their environment logically
 jahaan sidhaa pramaan nahin he, vahaan darshan shaastra kaa mahatv he
 When our ancestors tried to understand the mystery of the world, its past, present and future, its why and where at the time of leisure, every person in the difficult lack of direct results solved these questions in their own way
 yahi kaaran he ki vibhinn dharmik maton main hamako itnaa antar miltaa he, jo kabhi-kabhi vaimnasy or jhagade kaa rup le letaa he
 Not only are there differences in views of East and West, but each hemisphere has differences among its different views
 purv ke dharmon main, islam or hindu dharm main zaraa bhi anurupata nahin he
 In India itself, Buddhism and Jainism are very different from Brahmanism, in which opposing opinions like Arya Samaj and Sanatan Dharma are found
 puraane samay kaa ek swatantra vichaarak charvak he
 He challenged God in the old times itself
 har vyakti apane ko sahi maanata he
 It is unfortunate that instead of the old thinkers' experiences and ideas as the basis of the fight against ignorance in the future, we, like slackers, continue to shout the unwavering and unshakeable faith in the statement of what we have proved and The types are guilty of rooting the development of humanity
 sirf vishwaas or andh vishwaas khataranaak he
 It makes the brain dumb and human reactionary
 jo manushya apane ko yathartwaadee hone kaa daawa karata he, use samast pracheen rudhigat vishwaason ko chunauti deni hogi
 The prevailing opinion has to be tested on the basis of logic
 yadi ve tark kaa prahaar na sah sake, to tukade-tukade hokar gir padegaa
 Then to establish the new philosophy, to make them completely dashed, to clear the place and to reconstruct using some things of the old beliefs
 main pracheen vishwaason ke thospan par prashn karne ke sambandh main aashwast hum
 i firmly believe that a conscious supreme soul, who guides and guides the movement of nature, has no existence
 ham prakruti main vishwaas karte hai or samast pragatisheel aandolan kaa dhyey manushya dwaara apni seva ke liye prakruti par vijay praapt karnaa maanate hai
 There is no conscious power behind this direction
 yahi hamaara darshan he
 We want to ask the believers some questions
 yadi aapkaa vishwaas he ki ek sarvashaktimaan, sarvavyaapak or sarvagyani ishwar he, jisane vishwa kii rachana kii, to krupa karke mujhe yah bataayen ki usne yah rachana kyon kii? kashton or santapon se purna duniya – asankhya dukhon ke shaashvat anant gathbandhanon se grasit! ek bhi vyakti to puri tarah santrusht nahi he
 Please do not say that this is his rule
 yadi vah kisi niyam se bandhaa he to vah sarvashaktimaan nahin he
 He is also a slave to rules like us
 krupa karke yah bhi na kahen ki yah uskaa manoranjan he
 Nero had just lit a romp
 usne bahut thodi sankhya main logon kii hatya kii thi
 He caused very little sorrow for his complete entertainment
 or uskaa itihaas main kya sthaan he? use itihaaskaar kis naam se bulaate hai? sabhi vifaille visheshan us par barasaaye jate hai
 The pages are blackened by his blasphemous sentences, denouncing - Nero a heartless, merciless, wicked
 ek changez khan ne apane anand ke liye kuch hajaar jaane le leen or aaj ham uske naam se ghrinaa karte hai
 Then how do you justify your god? To the eternal Nero, who has been, and still continues to give, every day, every hour, and every minute, innumerable miseries
 phir tum kaise uske dushkarmon kaa paksh lene kii sochate ho, jo changez khan se prayek kshan adhik he? kya yah sab baad main in nirdosh ksht sahane waalon ko puraskaar or galati karne waalon ko dand dene ke liye ho rahaa he? thik he, thik he
 How long will you justify the person, who dares to inflict wounds on our body, because later, he will apply soft and comfortable ointments? gladator sanstha ke vyavasthaapak kahaan tak uchit karte the ki ek bhukhe khoonkhaar sher ke saamne manushya ko phenk do ki, yadi vah usase jaan bachaa letaa he, to uski khub dekhbhaal kii jaayegi? isaliye main poochta hum ki us chetan param aatma ne is vishwa or usamen manushyon kii rachana kyon kii? anand luutane ke liye? tab usamen or nero main kya fark he? You Muslims and Christians! You do not believe in past lives
 tum to hinduon kii tarah yah tark pesh nahin kar sakate ki pratyakshtah nirdosh vyaktiyon ke ksht unke purvajanmon ke karmon kaa fal he
 i ask you, why did that Almighty work for six days for the creation of the world by word? And why does he say every day that everything is fine? Call him today
 use pichhlaa itihaas dikhaao
 Let him study today's conditions
 ham dekhenge ki kya vah kehane kaa saahas karata he ki sab thik he
 From imprisonment to slums to slum settlements to millions of starving humans, to exploited laborers who are patiently watching bloodshed by capitalist vampires patiently and watching the waste of manpower that anyone sees Even the person, who has little knowledge, will tremble with fear, and instead of distributing more production to the needy people in the sea To throw it better, to the palaces of the kings whose foundations lay on the bones of human beings - let him see it all and then say - everything is fine!

 i ask what effect he has on humans as reformers? How many people have you met who say that they were born as donkeys in a past life due to some sin? not even one? Do not give examples from your Puranas
 mere paas tumhaari puranic kathaon ke liye koi sthaan nahin he
 And then do you know that the biggest sin in the world is to be poor

 main poochta hum ki dand prakriya kii kahaan tak prashansa karen, jo anivarytah manushya ko or adhik aparaadh karne ko baadhya kare? kya tumhaare ishwar ne yah nahin sochaa tha yaa usko bhi ye sari baaten maanavtaa dwaara akathaneey kashton ke jhelane kii keemat par anubhav se seekhni thim? tum kya sochate ho, kisi garib yaa anpadh parivaar, jaise ek chamaar yaa mehtar ke yahaan paidaa hone par insaan kaa kya bhagya hoga? chunki vah garib he, isaliye padhai nahin kar saktaa
 He remains despised and abandoned by his peers, who consider themselves elevated due to being born into an upper caste
 uskaa agyaan, uski garibi or usase kiya gaya vyavhaar uske hriday ko samaaj ke prati nishthur bana dete hai
 If he commits a sin, who will bear the consequences? Ishwar, he himself or the saint of society?

If they commit a crime, who will be responsible for it? And who will bear their blow? mere priy doston! ye siddhanth visheshadhikaar yukt logon ke avishkaar hai

 manushya jab apane pairon par khadaa hone kaa prayaas karata he or yathartwaadee ban jaataa he, tab use shraddha ko ek ore phenk dena chahie or un sabhi kashton, pareshaaniyon kaa purushatv ke saath saamana karnaa chahie, jinamein paristhitiyaan use patake sakati hai
 This is my position today
 yah meraa ahankaar nahin he, mere dost! yah mere sochane kaa tarika he, jisane mujhe naastik banaaya he
 The comments ishwar main vishwaas or rose-ba-rose kii prarthana ko main manushya ke liye sabase swaarthee or gira hua kaam maanata hum
 i have read about the atheists who bravely faced all the calamities
 atah main bhi ek purush kii bhaanti faansee ke phande kii antim ghadi tak sir ooncha kiye khadaa rahanaa chahta hum
 We have to see how i manage
 mere ek dost ne mujhe prarthana karne ko kaha
 When i told him about being an atheist, he said, "in your last days you will start believing
" '’ maine kaha, ‘'nahin, pyaare dost, aisa nahin hoga
 i explain this to myself as degrading and corrupt
 swaarthee kaarnon se main prarthana nahin karuunga
 "readers and friends, is this arrogance?" If it is, i accept it
 romance kii jagah gambheer vichaaron ne le lee, na or adhik rahasyavaad, na hi andhvishwaas
 Realism became our basis
 mujhe vishvakranti ke anek aadarshon ke bare main padhane kaa khub mauka mila
 i read Buchanin, the anarchist leader, Marx, the father of communism, but more Lenin, Tratsky, and others who successfully brought revolution in their country
 ye sabhi naastik the
 Later i got the book 'sahaj Gyan' by Niralamb Swami
 isamen rahasywaadee naastikta thi
 By the end of 1926, i was convinced that the talk of an almighty supreme soul, who created, guided and operated the universe, is a blatant nonsense
 maine apane is avishvaas ko pradarshit kiya
 i debated this topic with my friends
 main ek ghoshit naastik ho chukaa tha
 In May 1927 i was arrested in Lahore
 railway police hawalat main mujhe ek maheenaa kaatna padaa
 The police officers told me that i was in Lucknow when the Kakori team was under trial, that i had talked about some plan to get them released, that we had obtained some bombs after getting their consent, that in 1927 Dussehra On the occasion of one of those bombs was thrown at the crowd for testing, that if i make a statement highlighting the activities of the revolutionary party, i will not be arrested and To the contrary will be i will be released without presenting the informant in court and reward
 main is prastaav par hansaa
 It was all useless
 ham logon kii bhaanti vichaar rakhane vaale apni nirdosh janata par bam nahin phenkaa karte
 One day in the morning c
 ai
 D
 ke varisht adheekshak shri newman ne kaha ki yadi maine vaisaa vaktavy nahin diya, to mujh par kakori cese se sambandhit vidroh chhedane ke shadyantra or dashahra updrav main krur hatyaon ke liye mukadmaa chalaane par baadhya honge or ki unke paas mujhe sajaa dilaane or faansee par latakavane ke liye uchit pramaan hai
 From the same day, some police officers started luring me to praise God both times by the rule
 par ab main ek naastik tha
 i wanted to decide for myself whether in the days of peace and joy, i boast of being an atheist or even in such difficult times, i can stick to those principles
 bahut sochane ke baad maine nishchay kiya ki kisi bhi tarah ishwar par vishwaas or prarthana main nahin kar saktaa
 No, i did not do it even for a moment
 yahi asli pareekshan tha or main safal rahaa
 Now i was a firm believer and have been consistent ever since
 is pareekshan par khara utarana aasaan kaam na tha
 'faith' lightens the sufferings
 yahaan tak ki unhen sukhkar bana saktaa he
 In God, a base can be found that is extremely comforting to man
 uske bina manushya ko apane upar nirbhar karnaa padataa he
 Standing on your feet between the storm and the storm is not a child's play
 pariksha kii in ghadiyon main ahankaar yadi he, to bhaap ban kar ud jaataa he or manushya apane vishwaas ko thukaraane kaa saahas nahin kar paata
 If it does, then it leads to the conclusion that it has no other power but just ego
 aaj bilkul waisi hi sthiti he
 The full address of the decision is
 ek saptaah ke andar hi yah ghoshit ho jaayegaa ki main apana jivan ek dhyey par nyochaavar karne ja rahaa hum
 Apart from this idea, what else could be the consolation? ishwar main vishwaas rakhane vaala hindu punarjanm par raja hone kii aashaa kar saktaa he
 a Muslim or Christian can imagine the joy of prosperity in heaven and the rewards for their sufferings and sacrifices
 kintu main kya aashaa karun? main jaanata hum ki jis kshan rassi kaa fanda meri gardan par lagegaa or mere pairon ke neeche se takhta hatega, vah purna viraam hoga– vah antim kshan hoga
 i or my soul will all end there
 aage kuch na rahegaa
 a small battling life, which has no such glorious culmination, will be an award in itself - if i have the courage to see it from this point of view
 bina kisi swaarth ke yahaan yaa yahaan ke baad puraskaar kii ichha ke bina, maine anasakt bhav se apane jivan ko swatantrata ke dhyey par samarpit kar diya he, kyonki main or kuch kar hi nahin saktaa tha
 The day we will find many men and women of this mentality, who cannot devote their lives to anything other than the service of man and the salvation of the suffering humanity, the same day will be the beginning of the era of liberation
 ve shoshakon, utpeedakon or atyaachaariyon ko chunauti dene ke liye utprerit honge
 Not because he has to become king or get any other award here or in next life or after death in heaven
 unhen to maanavtaa kii gardan se daastaa kaa jua utaar phenkane or mukti evam shaanti sthapit karne ke liye is maarg ko apnaanaa hoga
 Will they walk the path that is dangerous for them but the only imaginable path for their great soul
 kya is mahaan dhyey ke prati unke garv ko ahankaar kahkar uskaa galat arth lagaaya jaayegaa? koun is prakaar ke ghrunit visheshan bolne kaa saahas karegaa? yaa to vah murkh he yaa dhoort
 We need to forgive him, because he cannot feel the high thoughts, feelings, impulses and their depths that are instilled in that heart
 uskaa hriday maance ke ek tukade kii tarah mrit he
 Her eyes are weakened by the shadow of the phantoms of other interests
 swayan par bharosa rakhane ke gun ko sadaiv ahankaar kii sangya di ja sakati he
 It is painful and annoying, but what is the choice? aalochana or swatantra vichaar ek krantikari ke donon anivaary gun hai
 Because our ancestors had built faith in some supreme soul
 atah koi bhi vyakti jo us vishwaas ko satyata yaa us param aatma ke astitv ko hi chunauti de, usko vidharmee, vishwasghaatee kaha jaayegaa
 If his arguments are so irrefutable that he cannot be rebutted by reason and his faith is so strong that he cannot be suppressed by showing fear of the plagues caused by the wrath of God, then he will be reprimanded by saying that he is boisterous
 yah meraa ahankaar nahin tha, jo mujhe naastikta kii ore le gaya
 The way my reasoning proves to be satisfactory is to be decided by my readers, not me
 main jaanata hum ki ishwar par vishwaas ne aaj meraa jivan aasaan or meraa boj halakaa kar diya hota
 My mistrust of him has made the whole atmosphere very dry
 thodaa-sa rahasyavaad ise kavitvamay bana saktaa he
 But my fate does not need any frenzy
 main yathartwaadee hum
 i want victory over inner nature with the help of conscience
 is dhyey main main sadaiv safal nahin hua hum
 It is man's duty to try
 safalataa to sanyog or vaataavaran par nirbhar he
 Someone who is a bit rational, would try to understand their environment logically
 jahaan sidhaa pramaan nahin he, vahaan darshan shaastra kaa mahatv he
 When our ancestors tried to understand the mystery of the world, its past, present and future, its why and where at the time of leisure, every person in the difficult lack of direct results solved these questions in their own way
 yahi kaaran he ki vibhinn dharmik maton main hamako itnaa antar miltaa he, jo kabhi-kabhi vaimnasy or jhagade kaa rup le letaa he
 Not only are there differences in views of East and West, but each hemisphere has differences among its different views
 purv ke dharmon main, islam or hindu dharm main zaraa bhi anurupata nahin he
 In India itself, Buddhism and Jainism are very different from Brahmanism, in which opposing opinions like Arya Samaj and Sanatan Dharma are found
 puraane samay kaa ek swatantra vichaarak charvak he
 He challenged God in the old times itself
 har vyakti apane ko sahi maanata he
 It is unfortunate that instead of the old thinkers' experiences and ideas as the basis of the fight against ignorance in the future, we, like slackers, continue to shout the unwavering and unshakeable faith in the statement of what we have proved and The types are guilty of rooting the development of humanity
 sirf vishwaas or andh vishwaas khataranaak he
 It makes the brain dumb and human reactionary
 jo manushya apane ko yathartwaadee hone kaa daawa karata he, use samast pracheen rudhigat vishwaason ko chunauti deni hogi
 The prevailing opinion has to be tested on the basis of logic
 yadi ve tark kaa prahaar na sah sake, to tukade-tukade hokar gir padegaa
 Then to establish the new philosophy, to make them completely dashed, to clear the place and to reconstruct using some things of the old beliefs
 main pracheen vishwaason ke thospan par prashn karne ke sambandh main aashwast hum
 i firmly believe that a conscious supreme soul, who guides and guides the movement of nature, has no existence
 ham prakruti main vishwaas karte hai or samast pragatisheel aandolan kaa dhyey manushya dwaara apni seva ke liye prakruti par vijay praapt karnaa maanate hai
 There is no conscious power behind this direction
 yahi hamaara darshan he
 We want to ask the believers some questions
 yadi aapkaa vishwaas he ki ek sarvashaktimaan, sarvavyaapak or sarvagyani ishwar he, jisane vishwa kii rachana kii, to krupa karke mujhe yah bataayen ki usne yah rachana kyon kii? kashton or santapon se purna duniya – asankhya dukhon ke shaashvat anant gathbandhanon se grasit! ek bhi vyakti to puri tarah santrusht nahi he
 Please do not say that this is his rule
 yadi vah kisi niyam se bandhaa he to vah sarvashaktimaan nahin he
 He is also a slave to rules like us
 krupa karke yah bhi na kahen ki yah uskaa manoranjan he
 Nero had just lit a romp
 usne bahut thodi sankhya main logon kii hatya kii thi
 He caused very little sorrow for his complete entertainment
 or uskaa itihaas main kya sthaan he? use itihaaskaar kis naam se bulaate hai? sabhi vifaille visheshan us par barasaaye jate hai
 The pages are blackened by his blasphemous sentences, denouncing - Nero a heartless, merciless, wicked
 ek changez khan ne apane anand ke liye kuch hajaar jaane le leen or aaj ham uske naam se ghrinaa karte hai
 Then how do you justify your god? To the eternal Nero, who has been, and still continues to give, every day, every hour, and every minute, innumerable miseries
 phir tum kaise uske dushkarmon kaa paksh lene kii sochate ho, jo changez khan se prayek kshan adhik he? kya yah sab baad main in nirdosh ksht sahane waalon ko puraskaar or galati karne waalon ko dand dene ke liye ho rahaa he? thik he, thik he
 How long will you justify the person, who dares to inflict wounds on our body, because later, he will apply soft and comfortable ointments? gladator sanstha ke vyavasthaapak kahaan tak uchit karte the ki ek bhukhe khoonkhaar sher ke saamne manushya ko phenk do ki, yadi vah usase jaan bachaa letaa he, to uski khub dekhbhaal kii jaayegi? isaliye main poochta hum ki us chetan param aatma ne is vishwa or usamen manushyon kii rachana kyon kii? anand luutane ke liye? tab usamen or nero main kya fark he? You Muslims and Christians! You do not believe in past lives
 tum to hinduon kii tarah yah tark pesh nahin kar sakate ki pratyakshtah nirdosh vyaktiyon ke ksht unke purvajanmon ke karmon kaa fal he
 i ask you, why did that Almighty work for six days for the creation of the world by word? And why does he say every day that everything is fine? Call him today
 use pichhlaa itihaas dikhaao
 Let him study today's conditions
 ham dekhenge ki kya vah kehane kaa saahas karata he ki sab thik he
 From imprisonment to slums to slum settlements to millions of starving humans, to exploited laborers who are patiently watching bloodshed by capitalist vampires patiently and watching the waste of manpower that anyone sees Even the person, who has little knowledge, will tremble with fear, and instead of distributing more production to the needy people in the sea To throw it better, to the palaces of the kings whose foundations lay on the bones of human beings - let him see it all and then say - everything is fine! Why and from where? This is my question
 tum chup ho
 Okay, then i go ahead
 or tum hinduon, tum kehete ho ki aaj jo ksht bhoga rahe hai, ye purvajanm ke paapi hai or aaj ke utpeedak pichley janmon main sadhu purush the, atah ve satta kaa anand lut rahe hai
 i have to admit that your ancestors were very clever people
 unhone aise siddhanth gadhe, jinamein tark or avishvaas ke sabhi prayaason ko vifal karne kii kaafii takat he
 According to jurisprudence, punishment can be justified for only three reasons depending on the effect it has on the offender
 ve hai – pratikaar, bhay or sudhaar
 Today the theory of retaliation is condemned by all progressive thinkers
 bhaybheet karne ke siddhanth kaa bhi ant vahiin he
 The principle of reform is only necessary and is essential for the progress of humanity
 iskaa dhyey apradhi ko yogya or shantipriy naagarik ke rup main samaaj ko lautaanaa he
 But even if we consider human beings to be criminals, what is the nature of punishment given to them by God? You say that he produces them by making cows, cats, trees, herbs or animals
 tum aise 84 lakh dandon ko ginate ho
 i ask what effect he has on humans as reformers? How many people have you met who say that they were born as donkeys in a past life due to some sin? not even one? Do not give examples from your Puranas
 mere paas tumhaari puranic kathaon ke liye koi sthaan nahin he
 And then do you know that the biggest sin in the world is to be poor
 garibi ek abhishaap he
 This is a punishment
 main poochta hum ki dand prakriya kii kahaan tak prashansa karen, jo anivarytah manushya ko or adhik aparaadh karne ko baadhya kare? kya tumhaare ishwar ne yah nahin sochaa tha yaa usko bhi ye sari baaten maanavtaa dwaara akathaneey kashton ke jhelane kii keemat par anubhav se seekhni thim? tum kya sochate ho, kisi garib yaa anpadh parivaar, jaise ek chamaar yaa mehtar ke yahaan paidaa hone par insaan kaa kya bhagya hoga? chunki vah garib he, isaliye padhai nahin kar saktaa
 He remains despised and abandoned by his peers, who consider themselves elevated due to being born into an upper caste
 uskaa agyaan, uski garibi or usase kiya gaya vyavhaar uske hriday ko samaaj ke prati nishthur bana dete hai
 If he commits a sin, who will bear the consequences? Ishwar, he himself or the saint of society? And what about the punishments of those whom the arrogant Brahmins deliberately kept ignorant and who had to bear the punishment of having to bear a stream of melted lead in their ears because of listening to some sentences of your sacred books of knowledge - the Vedas? If they commit a crime, who will be responsible for it? And who will bear their blow? mere priy doston! ye siddhanth visheshadhikaar yukt logon ke avishkaar hai
 They justify their captured power, capital and highness on the basis of these principles
 aptaan singhlair ne likhaa tha ki manushya ko bas amartv main vishwaas dilaa do or uske baad uski sari sampatti lut lo
 He will help you in this task without raving
 dharm ke upadeshkon or satta ke swaamiyon ke gathbandhan se hi jail, faansee, kode or ye siddhanth upajte hai
 i ask, why doesn't your all-powerful God stop every person when he is committing a sin or a crime? He can do this very easily
 usne kyon nahin ladaaku raajaaon kii ladane kii ugrata ko samaapt kiya or is prakaar vishwayuddh dwaara maanavtaa par padane vaali vipattiyon se use bachaaya? usne angrejon ke mastishk main bharat ko mukt kar dene kii bhaavana kyon nahin paidaa kii? vah kyon nahin puunjipatiyon ke hriday main yah paropkaaree utsaah bhar detaa ki ve utpaadan ke sadhano par apana vyaktigat sampatti kaa adhikaar tyaag den or is prakaar keval sampoorn shramik samudaay, varan samast maanav samaaj ko poonjivadi bediyon se mukt karen? aap samaajwaad kii vyaavhaarikta par tark karnaa chaahate hai
 i leave it to your almighty to enforce it
 jahaan tak saamaanya bhalaai kii baat he, log samaajwaad ke gunon ko maanate hai
 They oppose it with an excuse of not being practical
 paramatma ko aane do or vah cheez ko sahi tareeke se kar de
 The British rule here is not because God wants but because he has power and we do not have the courage to oppose him
 ve hamako apane prabhutv main ishwar kii madad se nahin rakhe hai, balki banduukon, riflon, bam or goliyon, police or sena ke sahare
 It is our apathy that they are successfully committing the most disgraceful crime against society - complete exploitation of one nation by another
 kahaan he ishwar? kya vah manushya jati ke in kashton kaa mazaa le rahaa he? ek nero, ek changez, uskaa naash ho! Do you ask me how do i explain the origin of this world and the origin of man? Ok let me tell you
 chalrs darvin ne is vishay par kuch prakaash daalane kii koshish kii he
 Read it yah ek prakruti kii ghatana he
 Earth formed by accidental mixing of various substances, in the shape of a nebula
 kab? itihaas dekho
 Animals were born from this type of phenomenon and humans in a long period
 darwin kii ‘jeev kii utpatti’ padho
 And then all the development was done by man's constant opposition to nature and the desire to conquer it
 yah is ghatana kii sambhavtah sabase sookshm vyakhya he
 Your second argument could be why a child is born blind or lame? Is it not the result of the work done in his previous birth? Biologists have found a scientific solution to this problem
 avashya hi tum ek or bachakaana prashn puch sakate ho
 If there is no God, then why did people believe in him? My answer is subtle and clear
 jis prakaar ve preton or dusht atmaaon main vishwaas karne lage
 The only difference is that belief in God is universal and philosophy is highly developed
 isaki utpatti kaa shrey un shoshakon kii pratibha ko he, jo paramatma ke astitv kaa upadesh dekar logon ko apane prabhutv main rakhana chaahate the or unase apni vishisht sthiti kaa adhikaar evam anumodan chaahate the
 All religions, sects, sects and other such institutions eventually become the supporters of ruthless and exploitative institutions, individuals and classes
 raja ke viruddh har vidroh har dharm main sadaiv hi paap rahaa he
 After recognizing man's limitations, understanding his weaknesses and demerits, he is tempted to face bravely at the time of examination, to face all the dangers with masculinity and to tie his eruption into prosperity and majesty
 Fantasy existence was created
 apane vyaktigat niyamon or abhibhavakeey udaartaa se purna ishwar kii badha-chadha kar kalpana evam chithran kiya gaya
 He is used as a fear-monger when he discusses his rage and personal rules
 taaki koi manushya samaaj ke liye khatara na ban jaye
 When his guardian qualities are explained, he is used as a father, mother, brother, sister, friend and helper
 jab manushya apane sabhi doston dwaara vishwasghaat or tyaag dene se atyant klesh main ho, tab use is vichaar se santvana mil sakati he ki ek sadaa sachcha dost uski sahaayta karne ko he, usko sahaara degaa or vah sarvashaktimaan he or kuch bhi kar saktaa he
 In fact it was useful for the society in the primitive period
 pidaa main pade manushya ke liye ishwar kii kalpana upyogi hoti he
 Society has to fight against this belief
 manushya jab apane pairon par khadaa hone kaa prayaas karata he or yathartwaadee ban jaataa he, tab use shraddha ko ek ore phenk dena chahie or un sabhi kashton, pareshaaniyon kaa purushatv ke saath saamana karnaa chahie, jinamein paristhitiyaan use patake sakati hai
 This is my position today
 yah meraa ahankaar nahin he, mere dost! yah mere sochane kaa tarika he, jisane mujhe naastik banaaya he
 The comments ishwar main vishwaas or rose-ba-rose kii prarthana ko main manushya ke liye sabase swaarthee or gira hua kaam maanata hum
 i have read about the atheists who bravely faced all the calamities
 atah main bhi ek purush kii bhaanti faansee ke phande kii antim ghadi tak sir ooncha kiye khadaa rahanaa chahta hum
 We have to see how i manage
 mere ek dost ne mujhe prarthana karne ko kaha
 When i told him about being an atheist, he said, "in your last days you will start believing
" '’ maine kaha, ‘'nahin, pyaare dost, aisa nahin hoga
 i explain this to myself as degrading and corrupt
 swaarthee kaarnon se main prarthana nahin karuunga
 "readers and friends, is this arrogance?" If it is, i accept it
 may 1927 main main lahore main giraftaar hua
 i had to spend a month in the railway police lockup
 police afasaron ne mujhe bataaya ki main lakhanu main tha, jab vahaan kakori dal kaa mukadmaa chal rahaa tha, ki maine unhen chhudaane kii kisi yojana par baat kii thi, ki unki sahmati paane ke baad hamane kuch bam praapt kiye the, ki 1927 main dashahra ke avasar par un bamon main se ek pareekshan ke liye bheed par phenkaa gaya, ki yadi main krantikari dal kii gatividhiyon par prakaash daalane vaala ek vaktavy de duun, to mujhe giraftaar nahin kiya jaayegaa or iske vipareet mujhe adaalat main mubir kii tarah pesh kiye bagaiyr reeha kar diya jaayegaa or inaam diya jaayegaa
 i laughed at the proposal
 yah sab bekaar kii baat thi
 We, like people, do not throw bombs on our innocent people
 ek din subah si
 I
 di
 Senior Superintendent of India Mr
 Neuman said that if i did not make such a statement, i would be forced to prosecute for conspiracy to wage a rebellion related to the Kakori case and for brutal murders in the Dussehra nuisance and that i would have the punishment and execution to hang me There is proper evidence for usee din se kuch police afasaron ne mujhe niyam se donon samay ishwar kii stuti karne ke liye phuslaana shuru kiya
 But now i was an atheist
 main swayan ke liye yah baat tay karnaa chahta tha ki kya shaanti or anand ke dinon main hi main naastik hone kaa dambh bharta hum yaa aise kathin samay main bhi main un siddhanton par adig rah saktaa hum
 After much thought, i decided that i could not believe and pray to God in any way
 nahin, maine ek kshan ke liye bhi nahin kii
 This was the real test and i was successful
 ab main ek pakkaa avishvasi tha or tab se lagaataar hum
 Passing this test was not an easy task
 ‘vishwaas’ kashton ko halakaa kar detaa he
 You can even make them pleasantly
 ishwar main manushya ko atyadhik santvana dene vaala ek aadhaar mil saktaa he
 Without that a man has to depend on himself
 toofaan or jhanjhaavat ke bich apane paanvon par khadaa rahanaa koi bacchon kaa khel nahin he
 If there is arrogance in these watches of examination, then steam evaporates and a man is not able to dare to reject his faith
 yadi aisa karata he, to isse yah nishkarsh nikalataa he ki uske paas sirf ahankaar nahin varan koi anya shakti he
 Today is exactly the same situation
 nirnay kaa puraa-puraa pataa he
 Within a week it will be announced that i am going to give up my life on one goal
 is vichaar ke atirikt or kya santvana ho sakati he? a Hindu who believes in God can hope to be a king on rebirth
 ek musalmaan yaa isai swarg main vyaapt samruddhi ke anand kii or apane kashton or balidaan ke liye puraskaar kii kalpana kar saktaa he
 But what can i expect? i know that the moment the loop of the rope falls on my neck and the bottom of my foot falls, it will be a complete stop - that will be the last moment
 main yaa meri aatma sab vahiin samaapt ho jaayegi
 Nothing will be ahead
 ek choti si juujhati hui zindagi, jisaki koi aisi gauravshaalee parinti nahin he, apane main swayan ek puraskaar hogi– yadi mujhamen is drushti se dekhne kaa saahas ho
 Without any selfishness here or without a desire for rewards here and there, i have surrendered my life to the goal of freedom, because i could not do anything else
 jis din hamen is manovriti ke bahut-se purush or mahilaayein mil jaayenge, jo apane jivan ko manushya kii seva or peedit maanavtaa ke uddhaar ke atirikt kahin samarpit kar hi nahin sakate, usee din mukti ke yug kaa shubharambh hoga
 They will be motivated to challenge exploiters, oppressors and oppressors
 is liye nahin ki unhen raja bananaa he yaa koi anya puraskaar praapt karnaa he yahaan yaa agle janm main yaa mrityoparant swarg main
 They will have to adopt this path to take the slavery gamble from the neck of humanity and establish liberation and peace
 kya ve us raste par chalenge jo unke apane liye khataranaak kintu unki mahaan aatma ke liye ek maatr kalpaneey rasta he
 Will his pride be misinterpreted as arrogance towards this noble cause? Who would dare to speak such a disgusting adjective? Either he is stupid or sly
 hamen chahie ki use kshamaa kar den, kyonki vah us hriday main udwelit ucch vichaaron, bhaawanaaon, aavegon or unki gaharaai ko mahasoos nahin kar saktaa
 His heart is dead like a piece of flesh
 uski ankhon par anya swaarthon ke preton kii chaaya padane se ve kamazor ho gayi hai
 The virtue of trusting oneself can always be termed as ego
 yah dukhapurna or kshtprad he, par chaara hi kya he? Criticism and free thought are both essential qualities of a revolutionary
 kyonki hamaare purvajon ne kisi param aatma ke prati vishwaas bana liya tha
 Therefore, any person who challenges that faith to the truth or the existence of that supreme soul will be called heretical, treacherous
 yadi uske tark itane akatya hai ki unka khandan vitark dwaara nahin ho saktaa or uski aasthaa itani prabal he ki use ishwar ke prakope se hone vaali vipattiyon kaa bhay dikhaa kar dabaaya nahin ja saktaa to uski yah kah kar ninda kii jaayegi ki vah vruthabhimani he
 It was not my ego that led me to atheism
 mere tark kaa tarika santoshprad siddh hota he yaa nahin iskaa nirnay mere pathakon ko karnaa he, mujhe nahin
 i know that faith in God would have made my life easier and my burden lighter today
 us par mere avishvaas ne saare vaataavaran ko atyant shushk bana diya he
 a little mysticism can make it poetic
 kintu mere bhagya ko kisi unmaad kaa sahaara nahin chahie
 i am realistic
 main antah prakruti par vivek kii sahaayta se vijay chahta hum
 i have not always succeeded in this cause
 prayaas karnaa manushya kaa kartavya he
 Success depends on coincidence and environment
 koi bhi manushya, jisamen tanik bhi vivek shakti he, vah apane vaataavaran ko taarkik rup se samajhnaa chahega
 Where there is no direct evidence, philosophy is important
 jab hamaare purvajon ne fursat ke samay vishwa ke rahasy ko, iske bhoot, vartmaan evam bhavishya ko, iske kyon or kahaan se ko samajhane kaa prayaas kiya to sidhe parinaamon ke kathin abhaav main har vyakti ne in prashnon ko apane bhang se hal kiya
 This is the reason why we find such a difference in different religious views, which sometimes takes the form of disharmony and quarrels
 na keval purv or pashchim ke darshanon main matbhed he, balki prayek golardh ke apane vibhinn maton main aapas main antar he
 In the earlier religions, there is no conformity between Islam and Hinduism
 bharat main hi buddha or jain dharm us brahmanwad se bahut alag he, jisamen swayan aryasamaj va sanathan dharm jaise virdohi mat paye jate hai
 Charwak is an old-time independent thinker
 usne ishwar ko puraane samay main hi chunauti di thi
 Everyone believes himself to be right
 durbhaagya kii baat he ki bajaay puraane vichaarkon ke anubhavon or vichaaron ko bhavishya main agyanta ke viruddh ladaai kaa aadhaar banane ke ham aalasiyon kii tarah, jo ham siddh ho chuke hai, unke kathan main avichal evam sanshayheen vishwaas kii cheekh pukaar karte rahete hai or is prakaar maanavtaa ke vikaas ko jad banane ke doshi hai
 Only faith and blind faith are dangerous
 yah mastishk ko mudh or manushya ko pratikriyaavaadi bana detaa he
 a man who claims to be realistic must challenge all ancient orthodox beliefs
 prachlit maton ko tark kii kasuti par kasnaa hoga
 If they could not bear the brunt of the argument, they would fall to pieces
 tab naye darshan kii sthapana ke liye unako puraa dharashayi karke jagah saaf karnaa or puraane vishwaason kii kuch baton kaa prayog karke punarniman karnaa
 i am confident about questioning the constancy of ancient beliefs
 mujhe puraa vishwaas he ki ek chetan param aatma kaa, jo prakruti kii gati kaa digdarshan evam sanchaalan karata he, koi astitv nahin he
 We believe in nature and the aim of the entire progressive movement is for man to conquer nature for his service
 isko disha dene ke peeche koi chetan shakti nahin he
 This is our philosophy
 ham aastikon se kuch prashn karnaa chaahate hai
 If you believe that there is an omnipotent, omniscient and omniscient God who created the world, then please tell me why he created it
 a world full of sorrows and sorrows - afflicted by eternal eternal alliances of innumerable sufferings! Not a single person is completely saturated
 kripaya yah na kahen ki yahi uskaa niyam he
 If he is bound by a rule he is not omnipotent
 vah bhi hamaari hi tarah niyamon kaa das he
 Please do not even say that this is his entertainment
 nero ne bas ek rome jalaayaa tha
 He killed a small number of people
 usne to bahut thodaa dukh paidaa kiya, apane purna manoranjan ke liye
 And what is its place in history? By what name are historians called him? All the poisonous adjectives are showered on him
 panne uski ninda ke vaakyon se kaale pute hai, bhartsana karte hai – nero ek hridayaheen, nirdayee, dusht
 a Genghis Khan took a few thousand lives for his joy and today we hate his name
 tab kis prakaar tum apane ishwar ko nyyochit tehraate ho? us shaashvat nero ko, jo har din, har ghante ore har minute asankhya dukh detaa rahaa, or abhi bhi de rahaa he
 Then how do you think of taking the side of his misdeeds, which is more every moment than Genghis Khan? Is all this happening later to reward these innocent victims and punish those who commit mistakes? OK OK
 tum kab tak us vyakti ko uchit tehraate rahoge, jo hamaare sharir par ghaav karne kaa saahas isaliye karata he ki baad main mulaayam or aaramdaayak malaham lagaayegaa? To what extent did the administrators of the Gladiator organization justify throwing a man in front of a hungry bloodless lion, that if he saves his life, he will be looked after? That is why i ask why that conscious supreme soul created this world and humans in it? To rob you of joy? Then what is the difference between him and Nero? tum musalamaanon or isaayiyon! tum to purvajanm main vishwaas nahin karte
 You, like Hindus, cannot argue that the suffering of innocent people is the result of the deeds of their past lives
 main tumse poochta hum ki us sarvashaktishaalee ne shabd dwaara vishwa ke utpatti ke liye chah din tak kyon parishram kiya? or prayek din vah kyon kahata he ki sab thik he? bulaao use aaj
 Show him past history
 use aaj kii paristhitiyon kaa adhyayan karne do
 We will see if he dares to say that all is well
 karawas kii kaal-kothriyon se lekar jhopadiyon kii bastiyon tak bhukh se tadapate lakhon insaanon se lekar un shoshit mazaduron se lekar jo poonjivadi pishaach dwaara khun chusane kii kriya ko dhairyapurvak nirutsaah se dekh rahe hai or us maanavshakti kii barbaadi dekh rahe hai, jise dekhakar koi bhi vyakti, jise tanik bhi sahaj gyaan he, bhay se sihar uthegaa, or adhik utpaadan ko zaruratmand logon main baantne ke bajaay samudr main phenk dena behatar samajhane se lekar raajaaon ke un mehalon tak jinaki neenv maanav kii haddiyon par padi he- usko yah sab dekhne do or phir kahe – sab kuch thik he! kyon or kahaan se? yahi meraa prashn he
 You are silent thik he, to main aage chalata hum
 And you Hindus, you say that those who are suffering today, they are sinners of previous lives and today's tyrants were saintly men in past lives, so they are robbing the joy of power
 mujhe yah maananaa padataa he ki aapke purvaj bahut chaalaak vyakti the
 He created theories that have the power to thwart all attempts of reason and mistrust
 nyaayashastra ke anusaar dand ko apradhi par padane vaale asar ke aadhaar par keval teen kaarnon se uchit tehraaya ja saktaa he
 They are retaliation, fear and correction
 aaj sabhi pragatisheel vichaarkon dwaara pratikaar ke siddhanth kii ninda kii jaati he
 The end of the principle of fear is also there
 sudhaar karne kaa siddhanth hi keval aavashyak he or maanavtaa kii pragati ke liye anivaary he
 Its mission is to return the offender to society as a qualified and peaceful citizen
 kintu yadi ham manushyon ko apradhi maan bhi len, to ishwar dwaara unhen diye gayi dand kii kya prakruti he? tum kehete ho vah unhen gaay, billi, ped, jadi-booti yaa jaanavar banaakar paidaa karata he
 You count 84 lakh such punishments
 main poochta hum ki manushya par inkaa sudhaarak ke rup main kya asar he? tum aise kitne vyaktiyon se mili ho, jo yah kehete hai ki ve kisi paap ke kaaran purvajanm main gadhaa ke rup main paidaa hue the? ek bhi nahin? apane puraanon se udhaaharan na do
 i have no place for your mythology
 or phir kya tumhen pataa he ki duniya main sabase bada paap garib hona he
 Poverty is a curse
 yah ek dand he
 To what extent should i praise the punishment process, which inevitably compels a man to commit more crimes? Did not your God think this or did he have to learn all these things from the experience of humanity at the cost of suffering inexplicable sufferings? What do you think, what will be the fate of a human being when a poor or illiterate family, like a chamar or a scavenger is born here? Since he is poor, he cannot study
 vah apane saathiyon se tiraskrit evam parityakt rahata he, jo oonchi jati main paidaa hone ke kaaran apane ko ooncha samajhate hai
 His ignorance, his poverty and his treatment make his heart callous to society
 yadi vah koi paap karata he to uskaa fal koun bhogega? ishvar, vah swayan yaa samaaj ke manishi? or un logon ke dand ke bare main kya hoga, jinhen dambhi brahmanon ne jaanboojh kar agyani banaaye rakhaa or jinako tumhaari gyaan kii pavitra pustakon – vedon ke kuch vaakya sun lene ke kaaran kaan main pighale sise kii dhara sahan karne kii sajaa bhugatni padati thi? yadi ve koi aparaadh karte hai, to uske liye koun zimmedaar hoga? or unka prahaar koun sahegaa? My dear friends These principles are inventions of privileged people
 ye apni hathiyaan hui shakti, puunji or ucchata ko in siddhanton ke aadhaar par sahi tehraate hai
 Uptan Sinclair wrote that just make a man believe in immortality and then rob all his property
 vah bagaiyr badbadaaye is kaary main tumhaari sahaayta karegaa
 Prisons, hangings, whips and these doctrines arise only from the alliance of preachers of religion and the masters of power
 main poochta hum tumhaara sarvashaktishaalee ishwar har vyakti ko kyon nahin us samay roktaa he jab vah koi paap yaa aparaadh kar rahaa hota he? yah to vah bahut aasaani se kar saktaa he
 Why didn't he end the fighting rage of the fighting kings and thus save him from the plagues of humanity by the world war? Why did he not evoke the feeling of liberating India in the British mind? Why wouldn't it fill the benevolent zeal in the hearts of the capitalists to relinquish their right to personal property over the means of production and thus only liberate the entire working community, but the entire human society, from the capitalist fetters? You want to argue the practicality of socialism
 main ise aapke sarvashaktimaan par chhod detaa hum ki vah lagu kare
 As far as general good is concerned, people regard the virtues of socialism
 ve iske vyaavhaarik na hone kaa bahaanaa lekar iskaa virodh karte hai
 Let the divine come and do that thing in the right way
 angrejon kii hukumat yahaan isaliye nahin he ki ishwar chahta he balki isaliye ki unke paas takat he or hamamen unka virodh karne kii himmat nahin
 They have not placed us in their dominion with the help of God, but with the help of guns, rifles, bombs and bullets, police and army
 yah hamaari udaseenta he ki ve samaaj ke viruddh sabase nindaneey aparaadh – ek raashtra kaa duusare raashtra dwaara atyaachaar purna shoshan – safaltaapurvak kar rahe hai
 Where is God? Is he enjoying these sufferings of mankind? One Nero, one Genghis, perish! kya tum mujhase poochhate ho ki main is vishwa kii utpatti or maanav kii utpatti kii vyakhya kaise karata hum? thik he, main tumhen bataata hum
 Charles Darwin has tried to throw some light on the subject
 use padho
 It is a phenomenon of nature
 vibhinn padaarthon ke, niharika ke aakaar main, aakasmik mishran se prithvi bani
 When? Look at the history
 isi prakaar kii ghatana se jantu paidaa hue or ek lambe daur main maanav
 Read Darwin's 'origin of Fauna'
 or taduparant sara vikaas manushya dwaara prakruti ke lagaataar virodh or us par vijay praapt karne kii cheshtaa se hua
 This is probably the most nuanced explanation of this incident
 tumhaara doosraa tark yah ho saktaa he ki kyon ek baccha andhaa yaa langadaa paidaa hota he? kya yah uske purvajanm main kiye gayi kaaryon kaa fal nahin he? jeevigyaan vettaon ne is samasya kaa vaigyanik samaadhaan nikaal liya he
 Of course you can ask another childish question
 yadi ishwar nahin he, to log usamen vishwaas kyon karne lage? meraa uttar sookshm or spasht he
 Just as they started believing in phantoms and evil spirits
 antar keval itnaa he ki ishwar main vishwaas vishwavyaapee he or darshan atyant viksit
 Its genesis is attributed to the genius of the exploiters, who preached the existence of God and wanted to keep the people in their dominion and asked for the right and approval of their specific position
 sabhi dharm, sampradaay, panth or aisi anya sansthaaen ant main nirdayee or shoshak sansthaaon, vyaktiyon or virgon kii samarthak ho jaati hai
 Every rebellion against the king has always been a sin in every religion
 manushya kii simaaon ko pahchaanane par, uski durbalata va dosha ko samajhane ke baad pariksha kii ghadiyon main manushya ko bahaduree se saamana karne ke liye utsahit karne, sabhi khataron ko purushatv ke saath jhelane or sampannataa evam aishwarya main uske visphot ko baandhne ke liye ishwar ke kaalpanik astitv kii rachana hui
 The full God was conceived and depicted by his personal rules and parental generosity
 jab uski ugrata or vyaktigat niyamon kii charchaa hoti he, to uskaa upyog ek bhay dikhaane vaale ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 So that no man becomes a threat to society
 jab uske abhibhavak gunon kii vyakhya hoti he, to uskaa upyog ek pita, mata, bhai, bahan, dost or sahaayak kii tarah kiya jaataa he
 When a man is in great distress at betrayal and abandonment by all his friends, he can be comforted by the idea that a true friend is always there to help him, support him and he is almighty and can do anything
 vastav main aadim kaal main yah samaaj ke liye upyogi tha
 Imagination of God is useful for a person suffering
 samaaj ko is vishwaas ke viruddh ladanaa hoga
 When a man tries to stand on his feet and becomes realistic, then he should throw reverence aside and face all the sufferings, troubles in manhood in which circumstances may strike him
 yahi aaj meri sthiti he
 This is not my ego, my friend! This is my way of thinking, which has made me an atheist
 tippaniyan i consider faith in God and daily prayer to be the most selfish and fallen work for man
 maine un naastikon ke bare main padhaa he, jinhone sabhi vipadaaon kaa bahaduree se saamana kiya
 Therefore, i also want to stand with my head raised till the last moment of the hanging loop like a man
 hamen dekhnaa he ki main kaise nibhaa paata hum
 a friend of mine asked me to pray
 jab maine use naastik hone kii baat bataayi to usne kaha, ‘'apane antim dinon main tum vishwaas karne lagoge
 "I said," No, dear friend, that will not happen
 main ise apane liye apmanjanak or bhrasht hone kii baat samajhaata hum
 i will not pray for selfish reasons
 '’ pathakon or doston, kya yah ahankaar he? agar he to main sweekaar karata hum
 From the same day, some police officers started luring me to praise God both times by the rule
 par ab main ek naastik tha
 i wanted to decide for myself whether in the days of peace and joy, i boast of being an atheist or even in such difficult times, i can stick to those principles
 bahut sochane ke baad maine nishchay kiya ki kisi bhi tarah ishwar par vishwaas or prarthana main nahin kar saktaa
 No, i did not do it even for a moment
 yahi asli pareekshan tha or main safal rahaa
 Now i was a firm believer and have been consistent ever since
 is pareekshan par khara utarana aasaan kaam na tha
 'faith' lightens the sufferings
 yahaan tak ki unhen sukhkar bana saktaa he
 In God, a base can be found that is extremely comforting to man
 uske bina manushya ko apane upar nirbhar karnaa padataa he
 Standing on your feet between the storm and the storm is not a child's play
 pariksha kii in ghadiyon main ahankaar yadi he, to bhaap ban kar ud jaataa he or manushya apane vishwaas ko thukaraane kaa saahas nahin kar paata
 If it does, then it leads to the conclusion that it has no other power but just ego
 aaj bilkul waisi hi sthiti he
 The full address of the decision is
 ek saptaah ke andar hi yah ghoshit ho jaayegaa ki main apana jivan ek dhyey par nyochaavar karne ja rahaa hum
 Apart from this idea, what else could be the consolation? ishwar main vishwaas rakhane vaala hindu punarjanm par raja hone kii aashaa kar saktaa he
 a Muslim or Christian can imagine the joy of prosperity in heaven and the rewards for their sufferings and sacrifices
 kintu main kya aashaa karun? main jaanata hum ki jis kshan rassi kaa fanda meri gardan par lagegaa or mere pairon ke neeche se takhta hatega, vah purna viraam hoga– vah antim kshan hoga
 i or my soul will all end there
 aage kuch na rahegaa
 a small battling life, which has no such glorious culmination, will be an award in itself - if i have the courage to see it from this point of view
 bina kisi swaarth ke yahaan yaa yahaan ke baad puraskaar kii ichha ke bina, maine anasakt bhav se apane jivan ko swatantrata ke dhyey par samarpit kar diya he, kyonki main or kuch kar hi nahin saktaa tha
 The day we will find many men and women of this mentality, who cannot devote their lives to anything other than the service of man and the salvation of the suffering humanity, the same day will be the beginning of the era of liberation
 ve shoshakon, utpeedakon or atyaachaariyon ko chunauti dene ke liye utprerit honge
 Not because he has to become king or get any other award here or in next life or after death in heaven
 unhen to maanavtaa kii gardan se daastaa kaa jua utaar phenkane or mukti evam shaanti sthapit karne ke liye is maarg ko apnaanaa hoga
 Will they walk the path that is dangerous for them but the only imaginable path for their great soul
 kya is mahaan dhyey ke prati unke garv ko ahankaar kahkar uskaa galat arth lagaaya jaayegaa? koun is prakaar ke ghrunit visheshan bolne kaa saahas karegaa? yaa to vah murkh he yaa dhoort
 We need to forgive him, because he cannot feel the high thoughts, feelings, impulses and their depths that are instilled in that heart
 uskaa hriday maance ke ek tukade kii tarah mrit he
 Her eyes are weakened by the shadow of the phantoms of other interests
 swayan par bharosa rakhane ke gun ko sadaiv ahankaar kii sangya di ja sakati he
 It is painful and annoying, but what is the choice? aalochana or swatantra vichaar ek krantikari ke donon anivaary gun hai
 Because our ancestors had built faith in some supreme soul
 atah koi bhi vyakti jo us vishwaas ko satyata yaa us param aatma ke astitv ko hi chunauti de, usko vidharmee, vishwasghaatee kaha jaayegaa
 If his arguments are so irrefutable that he cannot be rebutted by reason and his faith is so strong that he cannot be suppressed by showing fear of the plagues caused by the wrath of God, then he will be reprimanded by saying that he is boisterous
 yah meraa ahankaar nahin tha, jo mujhe naastikta kii ore le gaya
 The way my reasoning proves to be satisfactory is to be decided by my readers, not me
 main jaanata hum ki ishwar par vishwaas ne aaj meraa jivan aasaan or meraa boj halakaa kar diya hota
 My mistrust of him has made the whole atmosphere very dry
 thodaa-sa rahasyavaad ise kavitvamay bana saktaa he
 But my fate does not need any frenzy
 main yathartwaadee hum
 i want victory over inner nature with the help of conscience
 is dhyey main main sadaiv safal nahin hua hum
 It is man's duty to try
 safalataa to sanyog or vaataavaran par nirbhar he
 Someone who is a bit rational, would try to understand their environment logically
 jahaan sidhaa pramaan nahin he, vahaan darshan shaastra kaa mahatv he
 When our ancestors tried to understand the mystery of the world, its past, present and future, its why and where at the time of leisure, every person in the difficult lack of direct results solved these questions in their own way
 yahi kaaran he ki vibhinn dharmik maton main hamako itnaa antar miltaa he, jo kabhi-kabhi vaimnasy or jhagade kaa rup le letaa he
 Not only are there differences in views of East and West, but each hemisphere has differences among its different views
 purv ke dharmon main, islam or hindu dharm main zaraa bhi anurupata nahin he
 In India itself, Buddhism and Jainism are very different from Brahmanism, in which opposing opinions like Arya Samaj and Sanatan Dharma are found
 puraane samay kaa ek swatantra vichaarak charvak he
 He challenged God in the old times itself
 har vyakti apane ko sahi maanata he
 It is unfortunate that instead of the old thinkers' experiences and ideas as the basis of the fight against ignorance in the future, we, like slackers, continue to shout the unwavering and unshakeable faith in the statement of what we have proved and The types are guilty of rooting the development of humanity
 sirf vishwaas or andh vishwaas khataranaak he
 It makes the brain dumb and human reactionary
 jo manushya apane ko yathartwaadee hone kaa daawa karata he, use samast pracheen rudhigat vishwaason ko chunauti deni hogi
 The prevailing opinion has to be tested on the basis of logic
 yadi ve tark kaa prahaar na sah sake, to tukade-tukade hokar gir padegaa
 Then to establish the new philosophy, to make them completely dashed, to clear the place and to reconstruct using some things of the old beliefs
 main pracheen vishwaason ke thospan par prashn karne ke sambandh main aashwast hum
 i firmly believe that a conscious supreme soul, who guides and guides the movement of nature, has no existence
 ham prakruti main vishwaas karte hai or samast pragatisheel aandolan kaa dhyey manushya dwaara apni seva ke liye prakruti par vijay praapt karnaa maanate hai
 There is no conscious power behind this direction
 yahi hamaara darshan he
 We want to ask the believers some questions
 yadi aapkaa vishwaas he ki ek sarvashaktimaan, sarvavyaapak or sarvagyani ishwar he, jisane vishwa kii rachana kii, to krupa karke mujhe yah bataayen ki usne yah rachana kyon kii? kashton or santapon se purna duniya – asankhya dukhon ke shaashvat anant gathbandhanon se grasit! ek bhi vyakti to puri tarah santrusht nahi he
 Please do not say that this is his rule
 yadi vah kisi niyam se bandhaa he to vah sarvashaktimaan nahin he
 He is also a slave to rules like us
 krupa karke yah bhi na kahen ki yah uskaa manoranjan he
 Nero had just lit a romp
 usne bahut thodi sankhya main logon kii hatya kii thi
 He caused very little sorrow for his complete entertainment
 or uskaa itihaas main kya sthaan he? use itihaaskaar kis naam se bulaate hai? sabhi vifaille visheshan us par barasaaye jate hai
 The pages are blackened by his blasphemous sentences, denouncing - Nero a heartless, merciless, wicked
 ek changez khan ne apane anand ke liye kuch hajaar jaane le leen or aaj ham uske naam se ghrinaa karte hai
 Then how do you justify your god? To the eternal Nero, who has been, and still continues to give, every day, every hour, and every minute, innumerable miseries
 phir tum kaise uske dushkarmon kaa paksh lene kii sochate ho, jo changez khan se prayek kshan adhik he? kya yah sab baad main in nirdosh ksht sahane waalon ko puraskaar or galati karne waalon ko dand dene ke liye ho rahaa he? thik he, thik he
 How long will you justify the person, who dares to inflict wounds on our body, because later, he will apply soft and comfortable ointments? gladator sanstha ke vyavasthaapak kahaan tak uchit karte the ki ek bhukhe khoonkhaar sher ke saamne manushya ko phenk do ki, yadi vah usase jaan bachaa letaa he, to uski khub dekhbhaal kii jaayegi? isaliye main poochta hum ki us chetan param aatma ne is vishwa or usamen manushyon kii rachana kyon kii? anand luutane ke liye? tab usamen or nero main kya fark he? You Muslims and Christians! You do not believe in past lives
 tum to hinduon kii tarah yah tark pesh nahin kar sakate ki pratyakshtah nirdosh vyaktiyon ke ksht unke purvajanmon ke karmon kaa fal he
 i ask you, why did that Almighty work for six days for the creation of the world by word? And why does he say every day that everything is fine? Call him today
 use pichhlaa itihaas dikhaao
 Let him study today's conditions
 ham dekhenge ki kya vah kehane kaa saahas karata he ki sab thik he
 From imprisonment to slums to slum settlements to millions of starving humans, to exploited laborers who are patiently watching bloodshed by capitalist vampires patiently and watching the waste of manpower that anyone sees Even the person, who has little knowledge, will tremble with fear, and instead of distributing more production to the needy people in the sea To throw it better, to the palaces of the kings whose foundations lay on the bones of human beings - let him see it all and then say - everything is fine! Why and from where? This is my question
 tum chup ho
 Okay, then i go ahead
 or tum hinduon, tum kehete ho ki aaj jo ksht bhoga rahe hai, ye purvajanm ke paapi hai or aaj ke utpeedak pichley janmon main sadhu purush the, atah ve satta kaa anand lut rahe hai
 i have to admit that your ancestors were very clever people
 unhone aise siddhanth gadhe, jinamein tark or avishvaas ke sabhi prayaason ko vifal karne kii kaafii takat he
 According to jurisprudence, punishment can be justified for only three reasons depending on the effect it has on the offender
 ve hai – pratikaar, bhay or sudhaar
 Today the theory of retaliation is condemned by all progressive thinkers
 bhaybheet karne ke siddhanth kaa bhi ant vahiin he
 The principle of reform is only necessary and is essential for the progress of humanity
 iskaa dhyey apradhi ko yogya or shantipriy naagarik ke rup main samaaj ko lautaanaa he
 But even if we consider human beings to be criminals, what is the nature of punishment given to them by God? You say that he produces them by making cows, cats, trees, herbs or animals
 tum aise 84 lakh dandon ko ginate ho
 i ask what effect he has on humans as reformers? How many people have you met who say that they were born as donkeys in a past life due to some sin? not even one? Do not give examples from your Puranas
 mere paas tumhaari puranic kathaon ke liye koi sthaan nahin he
 And then do you know that the biggest sin in the world is to be poor
 garibi ek abhishaap he
 This is a punishment
 main poochta hum ki dand prakriya kii kahaan tak prashansa karen, jo anivarytah manushya ko or adhik aparaadh karne ko baadhya kare? kya tumhaare ishwar ne yah nahin sochaa tha yaa usko bhi ye sari baaten maanavtaa dwaara akathaneey kashton ke jhelane kii keemat par anubhav se seekhni thim? tum kya sochate ho, kisi garib yaa anpadh parivaar, jaise ek chamaar yaa mehtar ke yahaan paidaa hone par insaan kaa kya bhagya hoga? chunki vah garib he, isaliye padhai nahin kar saktaa
 He remains despised and abandoned by his peers, who consider themselves elevated due to being born into an upper caste
 uskaa agyaan, uski garibi or usase kiya gaya vyavhaar uske hriday ko samaaj ke prati nishthur bana dete hai
 If he commits a sin, who will bear the consequences? Ishwar, he himself or the saint of society? And what about the punishments of those whom the arrogant Brahmins deliberately kept ignorant and who had to bear the punishment of having to bear a stream of melted lead in their ears because of listening to some sentences of your sacred books of knowledge - the Vedas? If they commit a crime, who will be responsible for it? And who will bear their blow? mere priy doston! ye siddhanth visheshadhikaar yukt logon ke avishkaar hai
 They justify their captured power, capital and highness on the basis of these principles
 aptaan singhlair ne likhaa tha ki manushya ko bas amartv main vishwaas dilaa do or uske baad uski sari sampatti lut lo
 He will help you in this task without raving
 dharm ke upadeshkon or satta ke swaamiyon ke gathbandhan se hi jail, faansee, kode or ye siddhanth upajte hai
 i ask, why doesn't your all-powerful God stop every person when he is committing a sin or a crime? He can do this very easily
 usne kyon nahin ladaaku raajaaon kii ladane kii ugrata ko samaapt kiya or is prakaar vishwayuddh dwaara maanavtaa par padane vaali vipattiyon se use bachaaya? usne angrejon ke mastishk main bharat ko mukt kar dene kii bhaavana kyon nahin paidaa kii? vah kyon nahin puunjipatiyon ke hriday main yah paropkaaree utsaah bhar detaa ki ve utpaadan ke sadhano par apana vyaktigat sampatti kaa adhikaar tyaag den or is prakaar keval sampoorn shramik samudaay, varan samast maanav samaaj ko poonjivadi bediyon se mukt karen? aap samaajwaad kii vyaavhaarikta par tark karnaa chaahate hai
 i leave it to your almighty to enforce it
 jahaan tak saamaanya bhalaai kii baat he, log samaajwaad ke gunon ko maanate hai
 They oppose it with an excuse of not being practical
 paramatma ko aane do or vah cheez ko sahi tareeke se kar de
 The British rule here is not because God wants but because he has power and we do not have the courage to oppose him
 ve hamako apane prabhutv main ishwar kii madad se nahin rakhe hai, balki banduukon, riflon, bam or goliyon, police or sena ke sahare
 It is our apathy that they are successfully committing the most disgraceful crime against society - complete exploitation of one nation by another
 kahaan he ishwar? kya vah manushya jati ke in kashton kaa mazaa le rahaa he? ek nero, ek changez, uskaa naash ho! Do you ask me how do i explain the origin of this world and the origin of man? Ok let me tell you
 chalrs darvin ne is vishay par kuch prakaash daalane kii koshish kii he
 Read it yah ek prakruti kii ghatana he
 Earth formed by accidental mixing of various substances, in the shape of a nebula
 kab? itihaas dekho
 Animals were born from this type of phenomenon and humans in a long period
 darwin kii ‘jeev kii utpatti’ padho
 And then all the development was done by man's constant opposition to nature and the desire to conquer it
 yah is ghatana kii sambhavtah sabase sookshm vyakhya he
 Your second argument could be why a child is born blind or lame? Is it not the result of the work done in his previous birth? Biologists have found a scientific solution to this problem
 avashya hi tum ek or bachakaana prashn puch sakate ho
 If there is no God, then why did people believe in him? My answer is subtle and clear
 jis prakaar ve preton or dusht atmaaon main vishwaas karne lage
 The only difference is that belief in God is universal and philosophy is highly developed
 isaki utpatti kaa shrey un shoshakon kii pratibha ko he, jo paramatma ke astitv kaa upadesh dekar logon ko apane prabhutv main rakhana chaahate the or unase apni vishisht sthiti kaa adhikaar evam anumodan chaahate the
 All religions, sects, sects and other such institutions eventually become the supporters of ruthless and exploitative institutions, individuals and classes
 raja ke viruddh har vidroh har dharm main sadaiv hi paap rahaa he
 After recognizing man's limitations, understanding his weaknesses and demerits, he is tempted to face bravely at the time of examination, to face all the dangers with masculinity and to tie his eruption into prosperity and majesty
 Fantasy existence was created
 apane vyaktigat niyamon or abhibhavakeey udaartaa se purna ishwar kii badha-chadha kar kalpana evam chithran kiya gaya
 He is used as a fear-monger when he discusses his rage and personal rules
 taaki koi manushya samaaj ke liye khatara na ban jaye
 When his guardian qualities are explained, he is used as a father, mother, brother, sister, friend and helper
 jab manushya apane sabhi doston dwaara vishwasghaat or tyaag dene se atyant klesh main ho, tab use is vichaar se santvana mil sakati he ki ek sadaa sachcha dost uski sahaayta karne ko he, usko sahaara degaa or vah sarvashaktimaan he or kuch bhi kar saktaa he
 In fact it was useful for the society in the primitive period
 pidaa main pade manushya ke liye ishwar kii kalpana upyogi hoti he
 Society has to fight against this belief
 manushya jab apane pairon par khadaa hone kaa prayaas karata he or yathartwaadee ban jaataa he, tab use shraddha ko ek ore phenk dena chahie or un sabhi kashton, pareshaaniyon kaa purushatv ke saath saamana karnaa chahie, jinamein paristhitiyaan use patake sakati hai
 This is my position today
 yah meraa ahankaar nahin he, mere dost! yah mere sochane kaa tarika he, jisane mujhe naastik banaaya he
 The comments ishwar main vishwaas or rose-ba-rose kii prarthana ko main manushya ke liye sabase swaarthee or gira hua kaam maanata hum
 i have read about the atheists who bravely faced all the calamities
 atah main bhi ek purush kii bhaanti faansee ke phande kii antim ghadi tak sir ooncha kiye khadaa rahanaa chahta hum
 We have to see how i manage
 mere ek dost ne mujhe prarthana karne ko kaha
 When i told him about being an atheist, he said, "in your last days you will start believing
" '’ maine kaha, ‘'nahin, pyaare dost, aisa nahin hoga
 i explain this to myself as degrading and corrupt
 swaarthee kaarnon se main prarthana nahin karuunga
 "readers and friends, is this arrogance?" If it is, i accept it
 ishwar main manushya ko atyadhik santvana dene vaala ek aadhaar mil saktaa he
 Without that a man has to depend on himself
 toofaan or jhanjhaavat ke bich apane paanvon par khadaa rahanaa koi bacchon kaa khel nahin he
 If there is arrogance in these watches of examination, then steam evaporates and a man is not able to dare to reject his faith
 yadi aisa karata he, to isse yah nishkarsh nikalataa he ki uske paas sirf ahankaar nahin varan koi anya shakti he
 Today is exactly the same situation
 nirnay kaa puraa-puraa pataa he
 Within a week it will be announced that i am going to give up my life on one goal
 is vichaar ke atirikt or kya santvana ho sakati he? a Hindu who believes in God can hope to be a king on rebirth
 ek musalmaan yaa isai swarg main vyaapt samruddhi ke anand kii or apane kashton or balidaan ke liye puraskaar kii kalpana kar saktaa he
 But what can i expect? i know that the moment the loop of the rope falls on my neck and the bottom of my foot falls, it will be a complete stop - that will be the last moment
 main yaa meri aatma sab vahiin samaapt ho jaayegi
 Nothing will be ahead
 ek choti si juujhati hui zindagi, jisaki koi aisi gauravshaalee parinti nahin he, apane main swayan ek puraskaar hogi– yadi mujhamen is drushti se dekhne kaa saahas ho
 Without any selfishness here or without a desire for rewards here and there, i have surrendered my life to the goal of freedom, because i could not do anything else
 jis din hamen is manovriti ke bahut-se purush or mahilaayein mil jaayenge, jo apane jivan ko manushya kii seva or peedit maanavtaa ke uddhaar ke atirikt kahin samarpit kar hi nahin sakate, usee din mukti ke yug kaa shubharambh hoga
 They will be motivated to challenge exploiters, oppressors and oppressors
 is liye nahin ki unhen raja bananaa he yaa koi anya puraskaar praapt karnaa he yahaan yaa agle janm main yaa mrityoparant swarg main
 They will have to adopt this path to take the slavery gamble from the neck of humanity and establish liberation and peace
 kya ve us raste par chalenge jo unke apane liye khataranaak kintu unki mahaan aatma ke liye ek maatr kalpaneey rasta he
 Will his pride be misinterpreted as arrogance towards this noble cause? Who would dare to speak such a disgusting adjective? Either he is stupid or sly
 hamen chahie ki use kshamaa kar den, kyonki vah us hriday main udwelit ucch vichaaron, bhaawanaaon, aavegon or unki gaharaai ko mahasoos nahin kar saktaa
 His heart is dead like a piece of flesh
 uski ankhon par anya swaarthon ke preton kii chaaya padane se ve kamazor ho gayi hai
 The virtue of trusting oneself can always be termed as ego
 yah dukhapurna or kshtprad he, par chaara hi kya he? Criticism and free thought are both essential qualities of a revolutionary
 kyonki hamaare purvajon ne kisi param aatma ke prati vishwaas bana liya tha
 Therefore, any person who challenges that faith to the truth or the existence of that supreme soul will be called heretical, treacherous
 yadi uske tark itane akatya hai ki unka khandan vitark dwaara nahin ho saktaa or uski aasthaa itani prabal he ki use ishwar ke prakope se hone vaali vipattiyon kaa bhay dikhaa kar dabaaya nahin ja saktaa to uski yah kah kar ninda kii jaayegi ki vah vruthabhimani he
 It was not my ego that led me to atheism
 mere tark kaa tarika santoshprad siddh hota he yaa nahin iskaa nirnay mere pathakon ko karnaa he, mujhe nahin
 i know that faith in God would have made my life easier and my burden lighter today
 us par mere avishvaas ne saare vaataavaran ko atyant shushk bana diya he
 a little mysticism can make it poetic
 kintu mere bhagya ko kisi unmaad kaa sahaara nahin chahie
 i am realistic
 main antah prakruti par vivek kii sahaayta se vijay chahta hum
 i have not always succeeded in this cause
 prayaas karnaa manushya kaa kartavya he
 Success depends on coincidence and environment
 koi bhi manushya, jisamen tanik bhi vivek shakti he, vah apane vaataavaran ko taarkik rup se samajhnaa chahega
 Where there is no direct evidence, philosophy is important
 jab hamaare purvajon ne fursat ke samay vishwa ke rahasy ko, iske bhoot, vartmaan evam bhavishya ko, iske kyon or kahaan se ko samajhane kaa prayaas kiya to sidhe parinaamon ke kathin abhaav main har vyakti ne in prashnon ko apane bhang se hal kiya
 This is the reason why we find such a difference in different religious views, which sometimes takes the form of disharmony and quarrels
 na keval purv or pashchim ke darshanon main matbhed he, balki prayek golardh ke apane vibhinn maton main aapas main antar he
 In the earlier religions, there is no conformity between Islam and Hinduism
 bharat main hi buddha or jain dharm us brahmanwad se bahut alag he, jisamen swayan aryasamaj va sanathan dharm jaise virdohi mat paye jate hai
 Charwak is an old-time independent thinker
 usne ishwar ko puraane samay main hi chunauti di thi
 Everyone believes himself to be right
 durbhaagya kii baat he ki bajaay puraane vichaarkon ke anubhavon or vichaaron ko bhavishya main agyanta ke viruddh ladaai kaa aadhaar banane ke ham aalasiyon kii tarah, jo ham siddh ho chuke hai, unke kathan main avichal evam sanshayheen vishwaas kii cheekh pukaar karte rahete hai or is prakaar maanavtaa ke vikaas ko jad banane ke doshi hai
 Only faith and blind faith are dangerous
 yah mastishk ko mudh or manushya ko pratikriyaavaadi bana detaa he
 a man who claims to be realistic must challenge all ancient orthodox beliefs
 prachlit maton ko tark kii kasuti par kasnaa hoga
 If they could not bear the brunt of the argument, they would fall to pieces
 tab naye darshan kii sthapana ke liye unako puraa dharashayi karke jagah saaf karnaa or puraane vishwaason kii kuch baton kaa prayog karke punarniman karnaa
 i am confident about questioning the constancy of ancient beliefs
 mujhe puraa vishwaas he ki ek chetan param aatma kaa, jo prakruti kii gati kaa digdarshan evam sanchaalan karata he, koi astitv nahin he
 We believe in nature and the aim of the entire progressive movement is for man to conquer nature for his service
 isko disha dene ke peeche koi chetan shakti nahin he
 This is our philosophy
 ham aastikon se kuch prashn karnaa chaahate hai
 If you believe that there is an omnipotent, omniscient and omniscient God who created the world, then please tell me why he created it
 a world full of sorrows and sorrows - afflicted by eternal eternal alliances of innumerable sufferings! Not a single person is completely saturated
 kripaya yah na kahen ki yahi uskaa niyam he
 If he is bound by a rule he is not omnipotent
 vah bhi hamaari hi tarah niyamon kaa das he
 Please do not even say that this is his entertainment
 nero ne bas ek rome jalaayaa tha
 He killed a small number of people
 usne to bahut thodaa dukh paidaa kiya, apane purna manoranjan ke liye
 And what is its place in history? By what name are historians called him? All the poisonous adjectives are showered on him
 panne uski ninda ke vaakyon se kaale pute hai, bhartsana karte hai – nero ek hridayaheen, nirdayee, dusht
 a Genghis Khan took a few thousand lives for his joy and today we hate his name
 tab kis prakaar tum apane ishwar ko nyyochit tehraate ho? us shaashvat nero ko, jo har din, har ghante ore har minute asankhya dukh detaa rahaa, or abhi bhi de rahaa he
 Then how do you think of taking the side of his misdeeds, which is more every moment than Genghis Khan? Is all this happening later to reward these innocent victims and punish those who commit mistakes? OK OK
 tum kab tak us vyakti ko uchit tehraate rahoge, jo hamaare sharir par ghaav karne kaa saahas isaliye karata he ki baad main mulaayam or aaramdaayak malaham lagaayegaa? To what extent did the administrators of the Gladiator organization justify throwing a man in front of a hungry bloodless lion, that if he saves his life, he will be looked after? That is why i ask why that conscious supreme soul created this world and humans in it? To rob you of joy? Then what is the difference between him and Nero? tum musalamaanon or isaayiyon! tum to purvajanm main vishwaas nahin karte
 You, like Hindus, cannot argue that the suffering of innocent people is the result of the deeds of their past lives
 main tumse poochta hum ki us sarvashaktishaalee ne shabd dwaara vishwa ke utpatti ke liye chah din tak kyon parishram kiya? or prayek din vah kyon kahata he ki sab thik he? bulaao use aaj
 Show him past history
 use aaj kii paristhitiyon kaa adhyayan karne do
 We will see if he dares to say that all is well
 karawas kii kaal-kothriyon se lekar jhopadiyon kii bastiyon tak bhukh se tadapate lakhon insaanon se lekar un shoshit mazaduron se lekar jo poonjivadi pishaach dwaara khun chusane kii kriya ko dhairyapurvak nirutsaah se dekh rahe hai or us maanavshakti kii barbaadi dekh rahe hai, jise dekhakar koi bhi vyakti, jise tanik bhi sahaj gyaan he, bhay se sihar uthegaa, or adhik utpaadan ko zaruratmand logon main baantne ke bajaay samudr main phenk dena behatar samajhane se lekar raajaaon ke un mehalon tak jinaki neenv maanav kii haddiyon par padi he- usko yah sab dekhne do or phir kahe – sab kuch thik he! kyon or kahaan se? yahi meraa prashn he
 You are silent thik he, to main aage chalata hum
 And you Hindus, you say that those who are suffering today, they are sinners of previous lives and today's tyrants were saintly men in past lives, so they are robbing the joy of power
 mujhe yah maananaa padataa he ki aapke purvaj bahut chaalaak vyakti the
 He created theories that have the power to thwart all attempts of reason and mistrust
 nyaayashastra ke anusaar dand ko apradhi par padane vaale asar ke aadhaar par keval teen kaarnon se uchit tehraaya ja saktaa he
 They are retaliation, fear and correction
 aaj sabhi pragatisheel vichaarkon dwaara pratikaar ke siddhanth kii ninda kii jaati he
 The end of the principle of fear is also there
 sudhaar karne kaa siddhanth hi keval aavashyak he or maanavtaa kii pragati ke liye anivaary he
 Its mission is to return the offender to society as a qualified and peaceful citizen
 kintu yadi ham manushyon ko apradhi maan bhi len, to ishwar dwaara unhen diye gayi dand kii kya prakruti he? tum kehete ho vah unhen gaay, billi, ped, jadi-booti yaa jaanavar banaakar paidaa karata he
 You count 84 lakh such punishments
 main poochta hum ki manushya par inkaa sudhaarak ke rup main kya asar he? tum aise kitne vyaktiyon se mili ho, jo yah kehete hai ki ve kisi paap ke kaaran purvajanm main gadhaa ke rup main paidaa hue the? ek bhi nahin? apane puraanon se udhaaharan na do
 i have no place for your mythology
 or phir kya tumhen pataa he ki duniya main sabase bada paap garib hona he
 Poverty is a curse
 yah ek dand he
 To what extent should i praise the punishment process, which inevitably compels a man to commit more crimes? Did not your God think this or did he have to learn all these things from the experience of humanity at the cost of suffering inexplicable sufferings? What do you think, what will be the fate of a human being when a poor or illiterate family, like a chamar or a scavenger is born here? Since he is poor, he cannot study
 vah apane saathiyon se tiraskrit evam parityakt rahata he, jo oonchi jati main paidaa hone ke kaaran apane ko ooncha samajhate hai
 His ignorance, his poverty and his treatment make his heart callous to society
 yadi vah koi paap karata he to uskaa fal koun bhogega? ishvar, vah swayan yaa samaaj ke manishi? or un logon ke dand ke bare main kya hoga, jinhen dambhi brahmanon ne jaanboojh kar agyani banaaye rakhaa or jinako tumhaari gyaan kii pavitra pustakon – vedon ke kuch vaakya sun lene ke kaaran kaan main pighale sise kii dhara sahan karne kii sajaa bhugatni padati thi? yadi ve koi aparaadh karte hai, to uske liye koun zimmedaar hoga? or unka prahaar koun sahegaa? My dear friends These principles are inventions of privileged people
 ye apni hathiyaan hui shakti, puunji or ucchata ko in siddhanton ke aadhaar par sahi tehraate hai
 Uptan Sinclair wrote that just make a man believe in immortality and then rob all his property
 vah bagaiyr badbadaaye is kaary main tumhaari sahaayta karegaa
 Prisons, hangings, whips and these doctrines arise only from the alliance of preachers of religion and the masters of power
 main poochta hum tumhaara sarvashaktishaalee ishwar har vyakti ko kyon nahin us samay roktaa he jab vah koi paap yaa aparaadh kar rahaa hota he? yah to vah bahut aasaani se kar saktaa he
 Why didn't he end the fighting rage of the fighting kings and thus save him from the plagues of humanity by the world war? Why did he not evoke the feeling of liberating India in the British mind? Why wouldn't it fill the benevolent zeal in the hearts of the capitalists to relinquish their right to personal property over the means of production and thus only liberate the entire working community, but the entire human society, from the capitalist fetters? You want to argue the practicality of socialism
 main ise aapke sarvashaktimaan par chhod detaa hum ki vah lagu kare
 As far as general good is concerned, people regard the virtues of socialism
 ve iske vyaavhaarik na hone kaa bahaanaa lekar iskaa virodh karte hai
 Let the divine come and do that thing in the right way
 angrejon kii hukumat yahaan isaliye nahin he ki ishwar chahta he balki isaliye ki unke paas takat he or hamamen unka virodh karne kii himmat nahin
 They have not placed us in their dominion with the help of God, but with the help of guns, rifles, bombs and bullets, police and army
 yah hamaari udaseenta he ki ve samaaj ke viruddh sabase nindaneey aparaadh – ek raashtra kaa duusare raashtra dwaara atyaachaar purna shoshan – safaltaapurvak kar rahe hai
 Where is God? Is he enjoying these sufferings of mankind? One Nero, one Genghis, perish! kya tum mujhase poochhate ho ki main is vishwa kii utpatti or maanav kii utpatti kii vyakhya kaise karata hum? thik he, main tumhen bataata hum
 Charles Darwin has tried to throw some light on the subject
 use padho
 It is a phenomenon of nature
 vibhinn padaarthon ke, niharika ke aakaar main, aakasmik mishran se prithvi bani
 When? Look at the history
 isi prakaar kii ghatana se jantu paidaa hue or ek lambe daur main maanav
 Read Darwin's 'origin of Fauna'
 or taduparant sara vikaas manushya dwaara prakruti ke lagaataar virodh or us par vijay praapt karne kii cheshtaa se hua
 This is probably the most nuanced explanation of this incident
 tumhaara doosraa tark yah ho saktaa he ki kyon ek baccha andhaa yaa langadaa paidaa hota he? kya yah uske purvajanm main kiye gayi kaaryon kaa fal nahin he? jeevigyaan vettaon ne is samasya kaa vaigyanik samaadhaan nikaal liya he
 Of course you can ask another childish question
 yadi ishwar nahin he, to log usamen vishwaas kyon karne lage? meraa uttar sookshm or spasht he
 Just as they started believing in phantoms and evil spirits
 antar keval itnaa he ki ishwar main vishwaas vishwavyaapee he or darshan atyant viksit
 Its genesis is attributed to the genius of the exploiters, who preached the existence of God and wanted to keep the people in their dominion and asked for the right and approval of their specific position
 sabhi dharm, sampradaay, panth or aisi anya sansthaaen ant main nirdayee or shoshak sansthaaon, vyaktiyon or virgon kii samarthak ho jaati hai
 Every rebellion against the king has always been a sin in every religion
 manushya kii simaaon ko pahchaanane par, uski durbalata va dosha ko samajhane ke baad pariksha kii ghadiyon main manushya ko bahaduree se saamana karne ke liye utsahit karne, sabhi khataron ko purushatv ke saath jhelane or sampannataa evam aishwarya main uske visphot ko baandhne ke liye ishwar ke kaalpanik astitv kii rachana hui
 The full God was conceived and depicted by his personal rules and parental generosity
 jab uski ugrata or vyaktigat niyamon kii charchaa hoti he, to uskaa upyog ek bhay dikhaane vaale ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 So that no man becomes a threat to society
 jab uske abhibhavak gunon kii vyakhya hoti he, to uskaa upyog ek pita, mata, bhai, bahan, dost or sahaayak kii tarah kiya jaataa he
 When a man is in great distress at betrayal and abandonment by all his friends, he can be comforted by the idea that a true friend is always there to help him, support him and he is almighty and can do anything
 vastav main aadim kaal main yah samaaj ke liye upyogi tha
 Imagination of God is useful for a person suffering
 samaaj ko is vishwaas ke viruddh ladanaa hoga
 When a man tries to stand on his feet and becomes realistic, then he should throw reverence aside and face all the sufferings, troubles in manhood in which circumstances may strike him
 yahi aaj meri sthiti he
 This is not my ego, my friend! This is my way of thinking, which has made me an atheist
 tippaniyan i consider faith in God and daily prayer to be the most selfish and fallen work for man
 maine un naastikon ke bare main padhaa he, jinhone sabhi vipadaaon kaa bahaduree se saamana kiya
 Therefore, i also want to stand with my head raised till the last moment of the hanging loop like a man
 hamen dekhnaa he ki main kaise nibhaa paata hum
 a friend of mine asked me to pray
 jab maine use naastik hone kii baat bataayi to usne kaha, ‘'apane antim dinon main tum vishwaas karne lagoge
 "I said," No, dear friend, that will not happen
 main ise apane liye apmanjanak or bhrasht hone kii baat samajhaata hum
 i will not pray for selfish reasons
 '’ pathakon or doston, kya yah ahankaar he? agar he to main sweekaar karata hum
 a Hindu who believes in God can hope to be a king on rebirth

 i have no place for your mythology
 or phir kya tumhen pataa he ki duniya main sabase bada paap garib hona he
 Poverty is a curse
 yah ek dand he
 To what extent should i praise the punishment process, which inevitably compels a man to commit more crimes? Did not your God think this or did he have to learn all these things from the experience of humanity at the cost of suffering inexplicable sufferings? What do you think, what will be the fate of a human being when a poor or illiterate family, like a chamar or a scavenger is born here? Since he is poor, he cannot study
 vah apane saathiyon se tiraskrit evam parityakt rahata he, jo oonchi jati main paidaa hone ke kaaran apane ko ooncha samajhate hai
 His ignorance, his poverty and his treatment make his heart callous to society
 yadi vah koi paap karata he to uskaa fal koun bhogega? ishvar, vah swayan yaa samaaj ke manishi? or un logon ke dand ke bare main kya hoga, jinhen dambhi brahmanon ne jaanboojh kar agyani banaaye rakhaa or jinako tumhaari gyaan kii pavitra pustakon – vedon ke kuch vaakya sun lene ke kaaran kaan main pighale sise kii dhara sahan karne kii sajaa bhugatni padati thi? yadi ve koi aparaadh karte hai, to uske liye koun zimmedaar hoga? or unka prahaar koun sahegaa?

 Why didn't he end the fighting rage of the fighting kings and thus save him from the plagues of humanity by the world war? Why did he not evoke the feeling of liberating India in the British mind? Why wouldn't it fill the benevolent zeal in the hearts of the capitalists to relinquish their right to personal property over the means of production and thus only liberate the entire working community, but the entire human society, from the capitalist fetters? You want to argue the practicality of socialism
 main ise aapke sarvashaktimaan par chhod detaa hum ki vah lagu kare
 As far as general good is concerned, people regard the virtues of socialism

 Let the divine come and do that thing in the right way
 angrejon kii hukumat yahaan isaliye nahin he ki ishwar chahta he balki isaliye ki unke paas takat he or hamamen unka virodh karne kii himmat nahin
 They have not placed us in their dominion with the help of God, but with the help of guns, rifles, bombs and bullets, police and army

 Where is God? Is he enjoying these sufferings of mankind? One Nero, one Genghis, perish! kya tum mujhase poochhate ho ki main is vishwa kii utpatti or maanav kii utpatti kii vyakhya kaise karata hum? thik he, main tumhen bataata hum
 Charles Darwin has tried to throw some light on the subject
 use padho
 It is a phenomenon of nature
 vibhinn padaarthon ke, niharika ke aakaar main, aakasmik mishran se prithvi bani
 When? Look at the history
 isi prakaar kii ghatana se jantu paidaa hue or ek lambe daur main maanav
 Read Darwin's 'origin of Fauna'
 or taduparant sara vikaas manushya dwaara prakruti ke lagaataar virodh or us par vijay praapt karne kii cheshtaa se hua
 This is probably the most nuanced explanation of this incident
 tumhaara doosraa tark yah ho saktaa he ki kyon ek baccha andhaa yaa langadaa paidaa hota he? kya yah uske purvajanm main kiye gayi kaaryon kaa fal nahin he? jeevigyaan vettaon ne is samasya kaa vaigyanik samaadhaan nikaal liya he
 Of course you can ask another childish question
 yadi ishwar nahin he, to log usamen vishwaas kyon karne lage? meraa uttar sookshm or spasht he
 Just as they started believing in phantoms and evil spirits
 antar keval itnaa he ki ishwar main vishwaas vishwavyaapee he or darshan atyant viksit
 Its genesis is attributed to the genius of the exploiters, who preached the existence of God and wanted to keep the people in their dominion and asked for the right and approval of their specific position

 The full God was conceived and depicted by his personal rules and parental generosity
 jab uski ugrata or vyaktigat niyamon kii charchaa hoti he, to uskaa upyog ek bhay dikhaane vaale ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 So that no man becomes a threat to society
 jab uske abhibhavak gunon kii vyakhya hoti he, to uskaa upyog ek pita, mata, bhai, bahan, dost or sahaayak kii tarah kiya jaataa he
 When a man is in great distress at betrayal and abandonment by all his friends, he can be comforted by the idea that a true friend is always there to help him, support him and he is almighty and can do anything
 vastav main aadim kaal main yah samaaj ke liye upyogi tha
 Imagination of God is useful for a person suffering
 samaaj ko is vishwaas ke viruddh ladanaa hoga
 When a man tries to stand on his feet and becomes realistic, then he should throw reverence aside and face all the sufferings, troubles in manhood in which circumstances may strike him
 yahi aaj meri sthiti he
 This is not my ego, my friend! This is my way of thinking, which has made me an atheist
 tippaniyan i consider faith in God and daily prayer to be the most selfish and fallen work for man
 maine un naastikon ke bare main padhaa he, jinhone sabhi vipadaaon kaa bahaduree se saamana kiya
 Therefore, i also want to stand with my head raised till the last moment of the hanging loop like a man
 hamen dekhnaa he ki main kaise nibhaa paata hum
 a friend of mine asked me to pray
 jab maine use naastik hone kii baat bataayi to usne kaha, ‘'apane antim dinon main tum vishwaas karne lagoge
 "I said," No, dear friend, that will not happen
 main ise apane liye apmanjanak or bhrasht hone kii baat samajhaata hum
 i will not pray for selfish reasons
 '’ pathakon or doston, kya yah ahankaar he? agar he to main sweekaar karata hum
 Without any selfishness here or without a desire for rewards here and there, i have surrendered my life to the goal of freedom, because i could not do anything else
 jis din hamen is manovriti ke bahut-se purush or mahilaayein mil jaayenge, jo apane jivan ko manushya kii seva or peedit maanavtaa ke uddhaar ke atirikt kahin samarpit kar hi nahin sakate, usee din mukti ke yug kaa shubharambh hoga
 They will be motivated to challenge exploiters, oppressors and oppressors
 is liye nahin ki unhen raja bananaa he yaa koi anya puraskaar praapt karnaa he yahaan yaa agle janm main yaa mrityoparant swarg main
 They will have to adopt this path to take the slavery gamble from the neck of humanity and establish liberation and peace
 kya ve us raste par chalenge jo unke apane liye khataranaak kintu unki mahaan aatma ke liye ek maatr kalpaneey rasta he
 Will his pride be misinterpreted as arrogance towards this noble cause? Who would dare to speak such a disgusting adjective? Either he is stupid or sly
 hamen chahie ki use kshamaa kar den, kyonki vah us hriday main udwelit ucch vichaaron, bhaawanaaon, aavegon or unki gaharaai ko mahasoos nahin kar saktaa
 His heart is dead like a piece of flesh
 uski ankhon par anya swaarthon ke preton kii chaaya padane se ve kamazor ho gayi hai
 The virtue of trusting oneself can always be termed as ego
 yah dukhapurna or kshtprad he, par chaara hi kya he? Criticism and free thought are both essential qualities of a revolutionary
 kyonki hamaare purvajon ne kisi param aatma ke prati vishwaas bana liya tha
 Therefore, any person who challenges that faith to the truth or the existence of that supreme soul will be called heretical, treacherous
 yadi uske tark itane akatya hai ki unka khandan vitark dwaara nahin ho saktaa or uski aasthaa itani prabal he ki use ishwar ke prakope se hone vaali vipattiyon kaa bhay dikhaa kar dabaaya nahin ja saktaa to uski yah kah kar ninda kii jaayegi ki vah vruthabhimani he
 It was not my ego that led me to atheism

 Success depends on coincidence and environment

 If you believe that there is an omnipotent, omniscient and omniscient God who created the world, then please tell me why he created it
 a world full of sorrows and sorrows - afflicted by eternal eternal alliances of innumerable sufferings! Not a single person is completely saturated

 nero ne bas ek rome jalaayaa tha
 He killed a small number of people
 usne to bahut thodaa dukh paidaa kiya, apane purna manoranjan ke liye
 And what is its place in history? By what name are historians called him? All the poisonous adjectives are showered on him
 panne uski ninda ke vaakyon se kaale pute hai, bhartsana karte hai – nero ek hridayaheen, nirdayee, dusht
 a Genghis Khan took a few thousand lives for his joy and today we hate his name
 tab kis prakaar tum apane ishwar ko nyyochit tehraate ho? us shaashvat nero ko, jo har din, har ghante ore har minute asankhya dukh detaa rahaa, or abhi bhi de rahaa he
 Then how do you think of taking the side of his misdeeds, which is more every moment than Genghis Khan? Is all this happening later to reward these innocent victims and punish those who commit mistakes? OK OK
 tum kab tak us vyakti ko uchit tehraate rahoge, jo hamaare sharir par ghaav karne kaa saahas isaliye karata he ki baad main mulaayam or aaramdaayak malaham lagaayegaa? To what extent did the administrators of the Gladiator organization justify throwing a man in front of a hungry bloodless lion, that if he saves his life, he will be looked after? That is why i ask why that conscious supreme soul created this world and humans in it? To rob you of joy? Then what is the difference between him and Nero? tum musalamaanon or isaayiyon! tum to purvajanm main vishwaas nahin karte
 You, like Hindus, cannot argue that the suffering of innocent people is the result of the deeds of their past lives
 main tumse poochta hum ki us sarvashaktishaalee ne shabd dwaara vishwa ke utpatti ke liye chah din tak kyon parishram kiya? or prayek din vah kyon kahata he ki sab thik he? bulaao use aaj
 Show him past history
 use aaj kii paristhitiyon kaa adhyayan karne do
 We will see if he dares to say that all is well
 karawas kii kaal-kothriyon se lekar jhopadiyon kii bastiyon tak bhukh se tadapate lakhon insaanon se lekar un shoshit mazaduron se lekar jo poonjivadi pishaach dwaara khun chusane kii kriya ko dhairyapurvak nirutsaah se dekh rahe hai or us maanavshakti kii barbaadi dekh rahe hai, jise dekhakar koi bhi vyakti, jise tanik bhi sahaj gyaan he, bhay se sihar uthegaa, or adhik utpaadan ko zaruratmand logon main baantne ke bajaay samudr main phenk dena behatar samajhane se lekar raajaaon ke un mehalon tak jinaki neenv maanav kii haddiyon par padi he- usko yah sab dekhne do or phir kahe – sab kuch thik he! kyon or kahaan se? yahi meraa prashn he
 You are silent thik he, to main aage chalata hum
 And you Hindus, you say that those who are suffering today, they are sinners of previous lives and today's tyrants were saintly men in past lives, so they are robbing the joy of power
 mujhe yah maananaa padataa he ki aapke purvaj bahut chaalaak vyakti the
 He created theories that have the power to thwart all attempts of reason and mistrust
 nyaayashastra ke anusaar dand ko apradhi par padane vaale asar ke aadhaar par keval teen kaarnon se uchit tehraaya ja saktaa he
 They are retaliation, fear and correction

 yahi aaj meri sthiti he
 This is not my ego, my friend! This is my way of thinking, which has made me an atheist
 tippaniyan i consider faith in God and daily prayer to be the most selfish and fallen work for man
 maine un naastikon ke bare main padhaa he, jinhone sabhi vipadaaon kaa bahaduree se saamana kiya
 Therefore, i also want to stand with my head raised till the last moment of the hanging loop like a man
 hamen dekhnaa he ki main kaise nibhaa paata hum
 a friend of mine asked me to pray
 jab maine use naastik hone kii baat bataayi to usne kaha, ‘'apane antim dinon main tum vishwaas karne lagoge
 "I said," No, dear friend, that will not happen
 main ise apane liye apmanjanak or bhrasht hone kii baat samajhaata hum
 i will not pray for selfish reasons
 '’ pathakon or doston, kya yah ahankaar he? agar he to main sweekaar karata hum
 Criticism and free thought are both essential qualities of a revolutionary
 kyonki hamaare purvajon ne kisi param aatma ke prati vishwaas bana liya tha
 Therefore, any person who challenges that faith to the truth or the existence of that supreme soul will be called heretical, treacherous
 yadi uske tark itane akatya hai ki unka khandan vitark dwaara nahin ho saktaa or uski aasthaa itani prabal he ki use ishwar ke prakope se hone vaali vipattiyon kaa bhay dikhaa kar dabaaya nahin ja saktaa to uski yah kah kar ninda kii jaayegi ki vah vruthabhimani he
 It was not my ego that led me to atheism

 i know that faith in God would have made my life easier and my burden lighter today

 Success depends on coincidence and environment
 koi bhi manushya, jisamen tanik bhi vivek shakti he, vah apane vaataavaran ko taarkik rup se samajhnaa chahega
 Where there is no direct evidence, philosophy is important
 jab hamaare purvajon ne fursat ke samay vishwa ke rahasy ko, iske bhoot, vartmaan evam bhavishya ko, iske kyon or kahaan se ko samajhane kaa prayaas kiya to sidhe parinaamon ke kathin abhaav main har vyakti ne in prashnon ko apane bhang se hal kiya

 To what extent should i praise the punishment process, which inevitably compels a man to commit more crimes? Did not your God think this or did he have to learn all these things from the experience of humanity at the cost of suffering inexplicable sufferings?

 Charles Darwin has tried to throw some light on the subject
 use padho
 It is a phenomenon of nature
 vibhinn padaarthon ke, niharika ke aakaar main, aakasmik mishran se prithvi bani
 When? Look at the history
 isi prakaar kii ghatana se jantu paidaa hue or ek lambe daur main maanav
 Read Darwin's 'origin of Fauna'
 or taduparant sara vikaas manushya dwaara prakruti ke lagaataar virodh or us par vijay praapt karne kii cheshtaa se hua
 This is probably the most nuanced explanation of this incident
 tumhaara doosraa tark yah ho saktaa he ki kyon ek baccha andhaa yaa langadaa paidaa hota he? kya yah uske purvajanm main kiye gayi kaaryon kaa fal nahin he? jeevigyaan vettaon ne is samasya kaa vaigyanik samaadhaan nikaal liya he
 Of course you can ask another childish question
 yadi ishwar nahin he, to log usamen vishwaas kyon karne lage? meraa uttar sookshm or spasht he
 Just as they started believing in phantoms and evil spirits
 antar keval itnaa he ki ishwar main vishwaas vishwavyaapee he or darshan atyant viksit

 The full God was conceived and depicted by his personal rules and parental generosity
 jab uski ugrata or vyaktigat niyamon kii charchaa hoti he, to uskaa upyog ek bhay dikhaane vaale ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 So that no man becomes a threat to society
 jab uske abhibhavak gunon kii vyakhya hoti he, to uskaa upyog ek pita, mata, bhai, bahan, dost or sahaayak kii tarah kiya jaataa he
 When a man is in great distress at betrayal and abandonment by all his friends, he can be comforted by the idea that a true friend is always there to help him, support him and he is almighty and can do anything
 vastav main aadim kaal main yah samaaj ke liye upyogi tha
 Imagination of God is useful for a person suffering
 samaaj ko is vishwaas ke viruddh ladanaa hoga
 When a man tries to stand on his feet and becomes realistic, then he should throw reverence aside and face all the sufferings, troubles in manhood in which circumstances may strike him
 yahi aaj meri sthiti he
 This is not my ego, my friend! This is my way of thinking, which has made me an atheist
 tippaniyan i consider faith in God and daily prayer to be the most selfish and fallen work for man
 maine un naastikon ke bare main padhaa he, jinhone sabhi vipadaaon kaa bahaduree se saamana kiya
 Therefore, i also want to stand with my head raised till the last moment of the hanging loop like a man
 hamen dekhnaa he ki main kaise nibhaa paata hum
 a friend of mine asked me to pray
 jab maine use naastik hone kii baat bataayi to usne kaha, ‘'apane antim dinon main tum vishwaas karne lagoge
 "I said," No, dear friend, that will not happen
 main ise apane liye apmanjanak or bhrasht hone kii baat samajhaata hum
 i will not pray for selfish reasons
 '’ pathakon or doston, kya yah ahankaar he? agar he to main sweekaar karata hum
 This is the reason why we find such a difference in different religious views, which sometimes takes the form of disharmony and quarrels
 na keval purv or pashchim ke darshanon main matbhed he, balki prayek golardh ke apane vibhinn maton main aapas main antar he
 In the earlier religions, there is no conformity between Islam and Hinduism
 bharat main hi buddha or jain dharm us brahmanwad se bahut alag he, jisamen swayan aryasamaj va sanathan dharm jaise virdohi mat paye jate hai
 Charwak is an old-time independent thinker
 usne ishwar ko puraane samay main hi chunauti di thi
 Everyone believes himself to be right
 durbhaagya kii baat he ki bajaay puraane vichaarkon ke anubhavon or vichaaron ko bhavishya main agyanta ke viruddh ladaai kaa aadhaar banane ke ham aalasiyon kii tarah, jo ham siddh ho chuke hai, unke kathan main avichal evam sanshayheen vishwaas kii cheekh pukaar karte rahete hai or is prakaar maanavtaa ke vikaas ko jad banane ke doshi hai
 Only faith and blind faith are dangerous
 yah mastishk ko mudh or manushya ko pratikriyaavaadi bana detaa he
 a man who claims to be realistic must challenge all ancient orthodox beliefs
 prachlit maton ko tark kii kasuti par kasnaa hoga
 If they could not bear the brunt of the argument, they would fall to pieces
 tab naye darshan kii sthapana ke liye unako puraa dharashayi karke jagah saaf karnaa or puraane vishwaason kii kuch baton kaa prayog karke punarniman karnaa
 i am confident about questioning the constancy of ancient beliefs
 mujhe puraa vishwaas he ki ek chetan param aatma kaa, jo prakruti kii gati kaa digdarshan evam sanchaalan karata he, koi astitv nahin he
 We believe in nature and the aim of the entire progressive movement is for man to conquer nature for his service

 He created theories that have the power to thwart all attempts of reason and mistrust

 You count 84 lakh such punishments
 main poochta hum ki manushya par inkaa sudhaarak ke rup main kya asar he? tum aise kitne vyaktiyon se mili ho, jo yah kehete hai ki ve kisi paap ke kaaran purvajanm main gadhaa ke rup main paidaa hue the? ek bhi nahin? apane puraanon se udhaaharan na do
 i have no place for your mythology
 or phir kya tumhen pataa he ki duniya main sabase bada paap garib hona he
 Poverty is a curse
 yah ek dand he
 To what extent should i praise the punishment process, which inevitably compels a man to commit more crimes? Did not your God think this or did he have to learn all these things from the experience of humanity at the cost of suffering inexplicable sufferings? What do you think, what will be the fate of a human being when a poor or illiterate family, like a chamar or a scavenger is born here? Since he is poor, he cannot study
 vah apane saathiyon se tiraskrit evam parityakt rahata he, jo oonchi jati main paidaa hone ke kaaran apane ko ooncha samajhate hai
 His ignorance, his poverty and his treatment make his heart callous to society
 yadi vah koi paap karata he to uskaa fal koun bhogega? ishvar, vah swayan yaa samaaj ke manishi? or un logon ke dand ke bare main kya hoga, jinhen dambhi brahmanon ne jaanboojh kar agyani banaaye rakhaa or jinako tumhaari gyaan kii pavitra pustakon – vedon ke kuch vaakya sun lene ke kaaran kaan main pighale sise kii dhara sahan karne kii sajaa bhugatni padati thi? yadi ve koi aparaadh karte hai, to uske liye koun zimmedaar hoga? or unka prahaar koun sahegaa?

 Why didn't he end the fighting rage of the fighting kings and thus save him from the plagues of humanity by the world war? Why did he not evoke the feeling of liberating India in the British mind? Why wouldn't it fill the benevolent zeal in the hearts of the capitalists to relinquish their right to personal property over the means of production and thus only liberate the entire working community, but the entire human society, from the capitalist fetters? You want to argue the practicality of socialism

 Charles Darwin has tried to throw some light on the subject

 Of course you can ask another childish question

 Just as they started believing in phantoms and evil spirits

 So that no man becomes a threat to society
 jab uske abhibhavak gunon kii vyakhya hoti he, to uskaa upyog ek pita, mata, bhai, bahan, dost or sahaayak kii tarah kiya jaataa he
 When a man is in great distress at betrayal and abandonment by all his friends, he can be comforted by the idea that a true friend is always there to help him, support him and he is almighty and can do anything
 vastav main aadim kaal main yah samaaj ke liye upyogi tha
 Imagination of God is useful for a person suffering
 samaaj ko is vishwaas ke viruddh ladanaa hoga
 When a man tries to stand on his feet and becomes realistic, then he should throw reverence aside and face all the sufferings, troubles in manhood in which circumstances may strike him
 yahi aaj meri sthiti he
 This is not my ego, my friend! This is my way of thinking, which has made me an atheist
 tippaniyan i consider faith in God and daily prayer to be the most selfish and fallen work for man
 maine un naastikon ke bare main padhaa he, jinhone sabhi vipadaaon kaa bahaduree se saamana kiya
 Therefore, i also want to stand with my head raised till the last moment of the hanging loop like a man
 hamen dekhnaa he ki main kaise nibhaa paata hum
 a friend of mine asked me to pray
 jab maine use naastik hone kii baat bataayi to usne kaha, ‘'apane antim dinon main tum vishwaas karne lagoge
 "I said," No, dear friend, that will not happen
 main ise apane liye apmanjanak or bhrasht hone kii baat samajhaata hum
 i will not pray for selfish reasons
 '’ pathakon or doston, kya yah ahankaar he? agar he to main sweekaar karata hum
 If you believe that there is an omnipotent, omniscient and omniscient God who created the world, then please tell me why he created it
 a world full of sorrows and sorrows - afflicted by eternal eternal alliances of innumerable sufferings! Not a single person is completely saturated
 kripaya yah na kahen ki yahi uskaa niyam he
 If he is bound by a rule he is not omnipotent
 vah bhi hamaari hi tarah niyamon kaa das he
 Please do not even say that this is his entertainment
 nero ne bas ek rome jalaayaa tha
 He killed a small number of people
 usne to bahut thodaa dukh paidaa kiya, apane purna manoranjan ke liye
 And what is its place in history? By what name are historians called him? All the poisonous adjectives are showered on him
 panne uski ninda ke vaakyon se kaale pute hai, bhartsana karte hai – nero ek hridayaheen, nirdayee, dusht
 a Genghis Khan took a few thousand lives for his joy and today we hate his name
 tab kis prakaar tum apane ishwar ko nyyochit tehraate ho? us shaashvat nero ko, jo har din, har ghante ore har minute asankhya dukh detaa rahaa, or abhi bhi de rahaa he
 Then how do you think of taking the side of his misdeeds, which is more every moment than Genghis Khan? Is all this happening later to reward these innocent victims and punish those who commit mistakes? OK OK
 tum kab tak us vyakti ko uchit tehraate rahoge, jo hamaare sharir par ghaav karne kaa saahas isaliye karata he ki baad main mulaayam or aaramdaayak malaham lagaayegaa? To what extent did the administrators of the Gladiator organization justify throwing a man in front of a hungry bloodless lion, that if he saves his life, he will be looked after? That is why i ask why that conscious supreme soul created this world and humans in it? To rob you of joy? Then what is the difference between him and Nero? tum musalamaanon or isaayiyon! tum to purvajanm main vishwaas nahin karte
 You, like Hindus, cannot argue that the suffering of innocent people is the result of the deeds of their past lives
 main tumse poochta hum ki us sarvashaktishaalee ne shabd dwaara vishwa ke utpatti ke liye chah din tak kyon parishram kiya? or prayek din vah kyon kahata he ki sab thik he? bulaao use aaj
 Show him past history

 He caused very little sorrow for his complete entertainment
 or uskaa itihaas main kya sthaan he? use itihaaskaar kis naam se bulaate hai? sabhi vifaille visheshan us par barasaaye jate hai
 The pages are blackened by his blasphemous sentences, denouncing - Nero a heartless, merciless, wicked
 ek changez khan ne apane anand ke liye kuch hajaar jaane le leen or aaj ham uske naam se ghrinaa karte hai
 Then how do you justify your god? To the eternal Nero, who has been, and still continues to give, every day, every hour, and every minute, innumerable miseries
 phir tum kaise uske dushkarmon kaa paksh lene kii sochate ho, jo changez khan se prayek kshan adhik he? kya yah sab baad main in nirdosh ksht sahane waalon ko puraskaar or galati karne waalon ko dand dene ke liye ho rahaa he? thik he, thik he
 How long will you justify the person, who dares to inflict wounds on our body, because later, he will apply soft and comfortable ointments? gladator sanstha ke vyavasthaapak kahaan tak uchit karte the ki ek bhukhe khoonkhaar sher ke saamne manushya ko phenk do ki, yadi vah usase jaan bachaa letaa he, to uski khub dekhbhaal kii jaayegi? isaliye main poochta hum ki us chetan param aatma ne is vishwa or usamen manushyon kii rachana kyon kii? anand luutane ke liye? tab usamen or nero main kya fark he? You Muslims and Christians! You do not believe in past lives
 tum to hinduon kii tarah yah tark pesh nahin kar sakate ki pratyakshtah nirdosh vyaktiyon ke ksht unke purvajanmon ke karmon kaa fal he
 i ask you, why did that Almighty work for six days for the creation of the world by word? And why does he say every day that everything is fine? Call him today
 use pichhlaa itihaas dikhaao
 Let him study today's conditions
 ham dekhenge ki kya vah kehane kaa saahas karata he ki sab thik he
 From imprisonment to slums to slum settlements to millions of starving humans, to exploited laborers who are patiently watching bloodshed by capitalist vampires patiently and watching the waste of manpower that anyone sees Even the person, who has little knowledge, will tremble with fear, and instead of distributing more production to the needy people in the sea To throw it better, to the palaces of the kings whose foundations lay on the bones of human beings - let him see it all and then say - everything is fine! Why and from where? This is my question
 tum chup ho
 Okay, then i go ahead
 or tum hinduon, tum kehete ho ki aaj jo ksht bhoga rahe hai, ye purvajanm ke paapi hai or aaj ke utpeedak pichley janmon main sadhu purush the, atah ve satta kaa anand lut rahe hai
 i have to admit that your ancestors were very clever people
 unhone aise siddhanth gadhe, jinamein tark or avishvaas ke sabhi prayaason ko vifal karne kii kaafii takat he
 According to jurisprudence, punishment can be justified for only three reasons depending on the effect it has on the offender
 ve hai – pratikaar, bhay or sudhaar
 Today the theory of retaliation is condemned by all progressive thinkers
 bhaybheet karne ke siddhanth kaa bhi ant vahiin he
 The principle of reform is only necessary and is essential for the progress of humanity
 iskaa dhyey apradhi ko yogya or shantipriy naagarik ke rup main samaaj ko lautaanaa he
 But even if we consider human beings to be criminals, what is the nature of punishment given to them by God? You say that he produces them by making cows, cats, trees, herbs or animals
 tum aise 84 lakh dandon ko ginate ho
 i ask what effect he has on humans as reformers? How many people have you met who say that they were born as donkeys in a past life due to some sin? not even one? Do not give examples from your Puranas
 mere paas tumhaari puranic kathaon ke liye koi sthaan nahin he
 And then do you know that the biggest sin in the world is to be poor
 garibi ek abhishaap he
 This is a punishment
 main poochta hum ki dand prakriya kii kahaan tak prashansa karen, jo anivarytah manushya ko or adhik aparaadh karne ko baadhya kare? kya tumhaare ishwar ne yah nahin sochaa tha yaa usko bhi ye sari baaten maanavtaa dwaara akathaneey kashton ke jhelane kii keemat par anubhav se seekhni thim? tum kya sochate ho, kisi garib yaa anpadh parivaar, jaise ek chamaar yaa mehtar ke yahaan paidaa hone par insaan kaa kya bhagya hoga? chunki vah garib he, isaliye padhai nahin kar saktaa
 He remains despised and abandoned by his peers, who consider themselves elevated due to being born into an upper caste
 uskaa agyaan, uski garibi or usase kiya gaya vyavhaar uske hriday ko samaaj ke prati nishthur bana dete hai
 If he commits a sin, who will bear the consequences? Ishwar, he himself or the saint of society? And what about the punishments of those whom the arrogant Brahmins deliberately kept ignorant and who had to bear the punishment of having to bear a stream of melted lead in their ears because of listening to some sentences of your sacred books of knowledge - the Vedas? If they commit a crime, who will be responsible for it? And who will bear their blow? mere priy doston! ye siddhanth visheshadhikaar yukt logon ke avishkaar hai
 They justify their captured power, capital and highness on the basis of these principles
 aptaan singhlair ne likhaa tha ki manushya ko bas amartv main vishwaas dilaa do or uske baad uski sari sampatti lut lo
 He will help you in this task without raving
 dharm ke upadeshkon or satta ke swaamiyon ke gathbandhan se hi jail, faansee, kode or ye siddhanth upajte hai
 i ask, why doesn't your all-powerful God stop every person when he is committing a sin or a crime? He can do this very easily
 usne kyon nahin ladaaku raajaaon kii ladane kii ugrata ko samaapt kiya or is prakaar vishwayuddh dwaara maanavtaa par padane vaali vipattiyon se use bachaaya? usne angrejon ke mastishk main bharat ko mukt kar dene kii bhaavana kyon nahin paidaa kii? vah kyon nahin puunjipatiyon ke hriday main yah paropkaaree utsaah bhar detaa ki ve utpaadan ke sadhano par apana vyaktigat sampatti kaa adhikaar tyaag den or is prakaar keval sampoorn shramik samudaay, varan samast maanav samaaj ko poonjivadi bediyon se mukt karen? aap samaajwaad kii vyaavhaarikta par tark karnaa chaahate hai
 i leave it to your almighty to enforce it
 jahaan tak saamaanya bhalaai kii baat he, log samaajwaad ke gunon ko maanate hai
 They oppose it with an excuse of not being practical
 paramatma ko aane do or vah cheez ko sahi tareeke se kar de
 The British rule here is not because God wants but because he has power and we do not have the courage to oppose him
 ve hamako apane prabhutv main ishwar kii madad se nahin rakhe hai, balki banduukon, riflon, bam or goliyon, police or sena ke sahare
 It is our apathy that they are successfully committing the most disgraceful crime against society - complete exploitation of one nation by another
 kahaan he ishwar? kya vah manushya jati ke in kashton kaa mazaa le rahaa he? ek nero, ek changez, uskaa naash ho! Do you ask me how do i explain the origin of this world and the origin of man? Ok let me tell you
 chalrs darvin ne is vishay par kuch prakaash daalane kii koshish kii he
 Read it yah ek prakruti kii ghatana he
 Earth formed by accidental mixing of various substances, in the shape of a nebula
 kab? itihaas dekho
 Animals were born from this type of phenomenon and humans in a long period
 darwin kii ‘jeev kii utpatti’ padho
 And then all the development was done by man's constant opposition to nature and the desire to conquer it
 yah is ghatana kii sambhavtah sabase sookshm vyakhya he
 Your second argument could be why a child is born blind or lame? Is it not the result of the work done in his previous birth? Biologists have found a scientific solution to this problem
 avashya hi tum ek or bachakaana prashn puch sakate ho
 If there is no God, then why did people believe in him? My answer is subtle and clear
 jis prakaar ve preton or dusht atmaaon main vishwaas karne lage
 The only difference is that belief in God is universal and philosophy is highly developed
 isaki utpatti kaa shrey un shoshakon kii pratibha ko he, jo paramatma ke astitv kaa upadesh dekar logon ko apane prabhutv main rakhana chaahate the or unase apni vishisht sthiti kaa adhikaar evam anumodan chaahate the
 All religions, sects, sects and other such institutions eventually become the supporters of ruthless and exploitative institutions, individuals and classes
 raja ke viruddh har vidroh har dharm main sadaiv hi paap rahaa he
 After recognizing man's limitations, understanding his weaknesses and demerits, he is tempted to face bravely at the time of examination, to face all the dangers with masculinity and to tie his eruption into prosperity and majesty
 Fantasy existence was created
 apane vyaktigat niyamon or abhibhavakeey udaartaa se purna ishwar kii badha-chadha kar kalpana evam chithran kiya gaya
 He is used as a fear-monger when he discusses his rage and personal rules
 taaki koi manushya samaaj ke liye khatara na ban jaye
 When his guardian qualities are explained, he is used as a father, mother, brother, sister, friend and helper
 jab manushya apane sabhi doston dwaara vishwasghaat or tyaag dene se atyant klesh main ho, tab use is vichaar se santvana mil sakati he ki ek sadaa sachcha dost uski sahaayta karne ko he, usko sahaara degaa or vah sarvashaktimaan he or kuch bhi kar saktaa he
 In fact it was useful for the society in the primitive period
 pidaa main pade manushya ke liye ishwar kii kalpana upyogi hoti he
 Society has to fight against this belief
 manushya jab apane pairon par khadaa hone kaa prayaas karata he or yathartwaadee ban jaataa he, tab use shraddha ko ek ore phenk dena chahie or un sabhi kashton, pareshaaniyon kaa purushatv ke saath saamana karnaa chahie, jinamein paristhitiyaan use patake sakati hai
 This is my position today
 yah meraa ahankaar nahin he, mere dost! yah mere sochane kaa tarika he, jisane mujhe naastik banaaya he
 The comments ishwar main vishwaas or rose-ba-rose kii prarthana ko main manushya ke liye sabase swaarthee or gira hua kaam maanata hum
 i have read about the atheists who bravely faced all the calamities
 atah main bhi ek purush kii bhaanti faansee ke phande kii antim ghadi tak sir ooncha kiye khadaa rahanaa chahta hum
 We have to see how i manage
 mere ek dost ne mujhe prarthana karne ko kaha
 When i told him about being an atheist, he said, "in your last days you will start believing
" '’ maine kaha, ‘'nahin, pyaare dost, aisa nahin hoga
 i explain this to myself as degrading and corrupt
 swaarthee kaarnon se main prarthana nahin karuunga
 "readers and friends, is this arrogance?" If it is, i accept it
 gladator sanstha ke vyavasthaapak kahaan tak uchit karte the ki ek bhukhe khoonkhaar sher ke saamne manushya ko phenk do ki, yadi vah usase jaan bachaa letaa he, to uski khub dekhbhaal kii jaayegi? isaliye main poochta hum ki us chetan param aatma ne is vishwa or usamen manushyon kii rachana kyon kii? anand luutane ke liye? tab usamen or nero main kya fark he? You Muslims and Christians! You do not believe in past lives
 tum to hinduon kii tarah yah tark pesh nahin kar sakate ki pratyakshtah nirdosh vyaktiyon ke ksht unke purvajanmon ke karmon kaa fal he
 i ask you, why did that Almighty work for six days for the creation of the world by word? And why does he say every day that everything is fine? Call him today
 use pichhlaa itihaas dikhaao
 Let him study today's conditions
 ham dekhenge ki kya vah kehane kaa saahas karata he ki sab thik he
 From imprisonment to slums to slum settlements to millions of starving humans, to exploited laborers who are patiently watching bloodshed by capitalist vampires patiently and watching the waste of manpower that anyone sees Even the person, who has little knowledge, will tremble with fear, and instead of distributing more production to the needy people in the sea To throw it better, to the palaces of the kings whose foundations lay on the bones of human beings - let him see it all and then say - everything is fine! Why and from where? This is my question
 tum chup ho
 Okay, then i go ahead
 or tum hinduon, tum kehete ho ki aaj jo ksht bhoga rahe hai, ye purvajanm ke paapi hai or aaj ke utpeedak pichley janmon main sadhu purush the, atah ve satta kaa anand lut rahe hai
 i have to admit that your ancestors were very clever people
 unhone aise siddhanth gadhe, jinamein tark or avishvaas ke sabhi prayaason ko vifal karne kii kaafii takat he
 According to jurisprudence, punishment can be justified for only three reasons depending on the effect it has on the offender
 ve hai – pratikaar, bhay or sudhaar
 Today the theory of retaliation is condemned by all progressive thinkers
 bhaybheet karne ke siddhanth kaa bhi ant vahiin he
 The principle of reform is only necessary and is essential for the progress of humanity
 iskaa dhyey apradhi ko yogya or shantipriy naagarik ke rup main samaaj ko lautaanaa he
 But even if we consider human beings to be criminals, what is the nature of punishment given to them by God? You say that he produces them by making cows, cats, trees, herbs or animals
 tum aise 84 lakh dandon ko ginate ho
 i ask what effect he has on humans as reformers? How many people have you met who say that they were born as donkeys in a past life due to some sin? not even one? Do not give examples from your Puranas
 mere paas tumhaari puranic kathaon ke liye koi sthaan nahin he
 And then do you know that the biggest sin in the world is to be poor
 garibi ek abhishaap he
 This is a punishment
 main poochta hum ki dand prakriya kii kahaan tak prashansa karen, jo anivarytah manushya ko or adhik aparaadh karne ko baadhya kare? kya tumhaare ishwar ne yah nahin sochaa tha yaa usko bhi ye sari baaten maanavtaa dwaara akathaneey kashton ke jhelane kii keemat par anubhav se seekhni thim? tum kya sochate ho, kisi garib yaa anpadh parivaar, jaise ek chamaar yaa mehtar ke yahaan paidaa hone par insaan kaa kya bhagya hoga? chunki vah garib he, isaliye padhai nahin kar saktaa
 He remains despised and abandoned by his peers, who consider themselves elevated due to being born into an upper caste
 uskaa agyaan, uski garibi or usase kiya gaya vyavhaar uske hriday ko samaaj ke prati nishthur bana dete hai
 If he commits a sin, who will bear the consequences? Ishwar, he himself or the saint of society? And what about the punishments of those whom the arrogant Brahmins deliberately kept ignorant and who had to bear the punishment of having to bear a stream of melted lead in their ears because of listening to some sentences of your sacred books of knowledge - the Vedas? If they commit a crime, who will be responsible for it? And who will bear their blow? mere priy doston! ye siddhanth visheshadhikaar yukt logon ke avishkaar hai
 They justify their captured power, capital and highness on the basis of these principles
 aptaan singhlair ne likhaa tha ki manushya ko bas amartv main vishwaas dilaa do or uske baad uski sari sampatti lut lo
 He will help you in this task without raving
 dharm ke upadeshkon or satta ke swaamiyon ke gathbandhan se hi jail, faansee, kode or ye siddhanth upajte hai
 i ask, why doesn't your all-powerful God stop every person when he is committing a sin or a crime? He can do this very easily

 i leave it to your almighty to enforce it
 jahaan tak saamaanya bhalaai kii baat he, log samaajwaad ke gunon ko maanate hai
 They oppose it with an excuse of not being practical
 paramatma ko aane do or vah cheez ko sahi tareeke se kar de
 The British rule here is not because God wants but because he has power and we do not have the courage to oppose him
 ve hamako apane prabhutv main ishwar kii madad se nahin rakhe hai, balki banduukon, riflon, bam or goliyon, police or sena ke sahare
 It is our apathy that they are successfully committing the most disgraceful crime against society - complete exploitation of one nation by another
 kahaan he ishwar? kya vah manushya jati ke in kashton kaa mazaa le rahaa he? ek nero, ek changez, uskaa naash ho! Do you ask me how do i explain the origin of this world and the origin of man? Ok let me tell you
 chalrs darvin ne is vishay par kuch prakaash daalane kii koshish kii he
 Read it yah ek prakruti kii ghatana he
 Earth formed by accidental mixing of various substances, in the shape of a nebula
 kab? itihaas dekho
 Animals were born from this type of phenomenon and humans in a long period
 darwin kii ‘jeev kii utpatti’ padho
 And then all the development was done by man's constant opposition to nature and the desire to conquer it
 yah is ghatana kii sambhavtah sabase sookshm vyakhya he
 Your second argument could be why a child is born blind or lame? Is it not the result of the work done in his previous birth? Biologists have found a scientific solution to this problem
 avashya hi tum ek or bachakaana prashn puch sakate ho
 If there is no God, then why did people believe in him? My answer is subtle and clear
 jis prakaar ve preton or dusht atmaaon main vishwaas karne lage
 The only difference is that belief in God is universal and philosophy is highly developed
 isaki utpatti kaa shrey un shoshakon kii pratibha ko he, jo paramatma ke astitv kaa upadesh dekar logon ko apane prabhutv main rakhana chaahate the or unase apni vishisht sthiti kaa adhikaar evam anumodan chaahate the
 All religions, sects, sects and other such institutions eventually become the supporters of ruthless and exploitative institutions, individuals and classes
 raja ke viruddh har vidroh har dharm main sadaiv hi paap rahaa he
 After recognizing man's limitations, understanding his weaknesses and demerits, he is tempted to face bravely at the time of examination, to face all the dangers with masculinity and to tie his eruption into prosperity and majesty
 Fantasy existence was created
 apane vyaktigat niyamon or abhibhavakeey udaartaa se purna ishwar kii badha-chadha kar kalpana evam chithran kiya gaya

 "readers and friends, is this arrogance?" If it is, i accept it
 tum musalamaanon or isaayiyon! tum to purvajanm main vishwaas nahin karte
 You, like Hindus, cannot argue that the suffering of innocent people is the result of the deeds of their past lives
 main tumse poochta hum ki us sarvashaktishaalee ne shabd dwaara vishwa ke utpatti ke liye chah din tak kyon parishram kiya? or prayek din vah kyon kahata he ki sab thik he? bulaao use aaj
 Show him past history
 use aaj kii paristhitiyon kaa adhyayan karne do
 We will see if he dares to say that all is well
 karawas kii kaal-kothriyon se lekar jhopadiyon kii bastiyon tak bhukh se tadapate lakhon insaanon se lekar un shoshit mazaduron se lekar jo poonjivadi pishaach dwaara khun chusane kii kriya ko dhairyapurvak nirutsaah se dekh rahe hai or us maanavshakti kii barbaadi dekh rahe hai, jise dekhakar koi bhi vyakti, jise tanik bhi sahaj gyaan he, bhay se sihar uthegaa, or adhik utpaadan ko zaruratmand logon main baantne ke bajaay samudr main phenk dena behatar samajhane se lekar raajaaon ke un mehalon tak jinaki neenv maanav kii haddiyon par padi he- usko yah sab dekhne do or phir kahe – sab kuch thik he! kyon or kahaan se? yahi meraa prashn he
 You are silent thik he, to main aage chalata hum
 And you Hindus, you say that those who are suffering today, they are sinners of previous lives and today's tyrants were saintly men in past lives, so they are robbing the joy of power
 mujhe yah maananaa padataa he ki aapke purvaj bahut chaalaak vyakti the
 He created theories that have the power to thwart all attempts of reason and mistrust
 nyaayashastra ke anusaar dand ko apradhi par padane vaale asar ke aadhaar par keval teen kaarnon se uchit tehraaya ja saktaa he
 They are retaliation, fear and correction
 aaj sabhi pragatisheel vichaarkon dwaara pratikaar ke siddhanth kii ninda kii jaati he
 The end of the principle of fear is also there
 sudhaar karne kaa siddhanth hi keval aavashyak he or maanavtaa kii pragati ke liye anivaary he
 Its mission is to return the offender to society as a qualified and peaceful citizen
 kintu yadi ham manushyon ko apradhi maan bhi len, to ishwar dwaara unhen diye gayi dand kii kya prakruti he? tum kehete ho vah unhen gaay, billi, ped, jadi-booti yaa jaanavar banaakar paidaa karata he
 You count 84 lakh such punishments
 main poochta hum ki manushya par inkaa sudhaarak ke rup main kya asar he? tum aise kitne vyaktiyon se mili ho, jo yah kehete hai ki ve kisi paap ke kaaran purvajanm main gadhaa ke rup main paidaa hue the? ek bhi nahin? apane puraanon se udhaaharan na do
 i have no place for your mythology
 or phir kya tumhen pataa he ki duniya main sabase bada paap garib hona he
 Poverty is a curse
 yah ek dand he
 To what extent should i praise the punishment process, which inevitably compels a man to commit more crimes? Did not your God think this or did he have to learn all these things from the experience of humanity at the cost of suffering inexplicable sufferings? What do you think, what will be the fate of a human being when a poor or illiterate family, like a chamar or a scavenger is born here? Since he is poor, he cannot study
 vah apane saathiyon se tiraskrit evam parityakt rahata he, jo oonchi jati main paidaa hone ke kaaran apane ko ooncha samajhate hai
 His ignorance, his poverty and his treatment make his heart callous to society
 yadi vah koi paap karata he to uskaa fal koun bhogega? ishvar, vah swayan yaa samaaj ke manishi? or un logon ke dand ke bare main kya hoga, jinhen dambhi brahmanon ne jaanboojh kar agyani banaaye rakhaa or jinako tumhaari gyaan kii pavitra pustakon – vedon ke kuch vaakya sun lene ke kaaran kaan main pighale sise kii dhara sahan karne kii sajaa bhugatni padati thi? yadi ve koi aparaadh karte hai, to uske liye koun zimmedaar hoga? or unka prahaar koun sahegaa? My dear friends These principles are inventions of privileged people
 ye apni hathiyaan hui shakti, puunji or ucchata ko in siddhanton ke aadhaar par sahi tehraate hai
 Uptan Sinclair wrote that just make a man believe in immortality and then rob all his property
 vah bagaiyr badbadaaye is kaary main tumhaari sahaayta karegaa
 Prisons, hangings, whips and these doctrines arise only from the alliance of preachers of religion and the masters of power
 main poochta hum tumhaara sarvashaktishaalee ishwar har vyakti ko kyon nahin us samay roktaa he jab vah koi paap yaa aparaadh kar rahaa hota he? yah to vah bahut aasaani se kar saktaa he
 Why didn't he end the fighting rage of the fighting kings and thus save him from the plagues of humanity by the world war? Why did he not evoke the feeling of liberating India in the British mind? Why wouldn't it fill the benevolent zeal in the hearts of the capitalists to relinquish their right to personal property over the means of production and thus only liberate the entire working community, but the entire human society, from the capitalist fetters? You want to argue the practicality of socialism
 main ise aapke sarvashaktimaan par chhod detaa hum ki vah lagu kare
 As far as general good is concerned, people regard the virtues of socialism
 ve iske vyaavhaarik na hone kaa bahaanaa lekar iskaa virodh karte hai
 Let the divine come and do that thing in the right way
 angrejon kii hukumat yahaan isaliye nahin he ki ishwar chahta he balki isaliye ki unke paas takat he or hamamen unka virodh karne kii himmat nahin
 They have not placed us in their dominion with the help of God, but with the help of guns, rifles, bombs and bullets, police and army
 yah hamaari udaseenta he ki ve samaaj ke viruddh sabase nindaneey aparaadh – ek raashtra kaa duusare raashtra dwaara atyaachaar purna shoshan – safaltaapurvak kar rahe hai
 Where is God? Is he enjoying these sufferings of mankind? One Nero, one Genghis, perish! kya tum mujhase poochhate ho ki main is vishwa kii utpatti or maanav kii utpatti kii vyakhya kaise karata hum? thik he, main tumhen bataata hum
 Charles Darwin has tried to throw some light on the subject
 use padho
 It is a phenomenon of nature
 vibhinn padaarthon ke, niharika ke aakaar main, aakasmik mishran se prithvi bani
 When? Look at the history
 isi prakaar kii ghatana se jantu paidaa hue or ek lambe daur main maanav
 Read Darwin's 'origin of Fauna'
 or taduparant sara vikaas manushya dwaara prakruti ke lagaataar virodh or us par vijay praapt karne kii cheshtaa se hua
 This is probably the most nuanced explanation of this incident
 tumhaara doosraa tark yah ho saktaa he ki kyon ek baccha andhaa yaa langadaa paidaa hota he? kya yah uske purvajanm main kiye gayi kaaryon kaa fal nahin he? jeevigyaan vettaon ne is samasya kaa vaigyanik samaadhaan nikaal liya he
 Of course you can ask another childish question
 yadi ishwar nahin he, to log usamen vishwaas kyon karne lage? meraa uttar sookshm or spasht he
 Just as they started believing in phantoms and evil spirits
 antar keval itnaa he ki ishwar main vishwaas vishwavyaapee he or darshan atyant viksit
 Its genesis is attributed to the genius of the exploiters, who preached the existence of God and wanted to keep the people in their dominion and asked for the right and approval of their specific position
 sabhi dharm, sampradaay, panth or aisi anya sansthaaen ant main nirdayee or shoshak sansthaaon, vyaktiyon or virgon kii samarthak ho jaati hai
 Every rebellion against the king has always been a sin in every religion
 manushya kii simaaon ko pahchaanane par, uski durbalata va dosha ko samajhane ke baad pariksha kii ghadiyon main manushya ko bahaduree se saamana karne ke liye utsahit karne, sabhi khataron ko purushatv ke saath jhelane or sampannataa evam aishwarya main uske visphot ko baandhne ke liye ishwar ke kaalpanik astitv kii rachana hui
 The full God was conceived and depicted by his personal rules and parental generosity
 jab uski ugrata or vyaktigat niyamon kii charchaa hoti he, to uskaa upyog ek bhay dikhaane vaale ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 So that no man becomes a threat to society
 jab uske abhibhavak gunon kii vyakhya hoti he, to uskaa upyog ek pita, mata, bhai, bahan, dost or sahaayak kii tarah kiya jaataa he
 When a man is in great distress at betrayal and abandonment by all his friends, he can be comforted by the idea that a true friend is always there to help him, support him and he is almighty and can do anything
 vastav main aadim kaal main yah samaaj ke liye upyogi tha
 Imagination of God is useful for a person suffering
 samaaj ko is vishwaas ke viruddh ladanaa hoga
 When a man tries to stand on his feet and becomes realistic, then he should throw reverence aside and face all the sufferings, troubles in manhood in which circumstances may strike him
 yahi aaj meri sthiti he
 This is not my ego, my friend! This is my way of thinking, which has made me an atheist
 tippaniyan i consider faith in God and daily prayer to be the most selfish and fallen work for man
 maine un naastikon ke bare main padhaa he, jinhone sabhi vipadaaon kaa bahaduree se saamana kiya
 Therefore, i also want to stand with my head raised till the last moment of the hanging loop like a man
 hamen dekhnaa he ki main kaise nibhaa paata hum
 a friend of mine asked me to pray
 jab maine use naastik hone kii baat bataayi to usne kaha, ‘'apane antim dinon main tum vishwaas karne lagoge
 "I said," No, dear friend, that will not happen
 main ise apane liye apmanjanak or bhrasht hone kii baat samajhaata hum
 i will not pray for selfish reasons
 '’ pathakon or doston, kya yah ahankaar he? agar he to main sweekaar karata hum

 manushya jab apane pairon par khadaa hone kaa prayaas karata he or yathartwaadee ban jaataa he, tab use shraddha ko ek ore phenk dena chahie or un sabhi kashton, pareshaaniyon kaa purushatv ke saath saamana karnaa chahie, jinamein paristhitiyaan use patake sakati hai
 This is my position today
 yah meraa ahankaar nahin he, mere dost! yah mere sochane kaa tarika he, jisane mujhe naastik banaaya he
 The comments ishwar main vishwaas or rose-ba-rose kii prarthana ko main manushya ke liye sabase swaarthee or gira hua kaam maanata hum
 i have read about the atheists who bravely faced all the calamities
 atah main bhi ek purush kii bhaanti faansee ke phande kii antim ghadi tak sir ooncha kiye khadaa rahanaa chahta hum
 We have to see how i manage
 mere ek dost ne mujhe prarthana karne ko kaha
 When i told him about being an atheist, he said, "in your last days you will start believing
" '’ maine kaha, ‘'nahin, pyaare dost, aisa nahin hoga
 i explain this to myself as degrading and corrupt
 swaarthee kaarnon se main prarthana nahin karuunga
 "readers and friends, is this arrogance?" If it is, i accept it
 or tum hinduon, tum kehete ho ki aaj jo ksht bhoga rahe hai, ye purvajanm ke paapi hai or aaj ke utpeedak pichley janmon main sadhu purush the, atah ve satta kaa anand lut rahe hai
 i have to admit that your ancestors were very clever people
 unhone aise siddhanth gadhe, jinamein tark or avishvaas ke sabhi prayaason ko vifal karne kii kaafii takat he
 According to jurisprudence, punishment can be justified for only three reasons depending on the effect it has on the offender
 ve hai – pratikaar, bhay or sudhaar
 Today the theory of retaliation is condemned by all progressive thinkers
 bhaybheet karne ke siddhanth kaa bhi ant vahiin he
 The principle of reform is only necessary and is essential for the progress of humanity
 iskaa dhyey apradhi ko yogya or shantipriy naagarik ke rup main samaaj ko lautaanaa he
 But even if we consider human beings to be criminals, what is the nature of punishment given to them by God? You say that he produces them by making cows, cats, trees, herbs or animals
 tum aise 84 lakh dandon ko ginate ho
 i ask what effect he has on humans as reformers? How many people have you met who say that they were born as donkeys in a past life due to some sin? not even one? Do not give examples from your Puranas
 mere paas tumhaari puranic kathaon ke liye koi sthaan nahin he
 And then do you know that the greatest power in the world is to be poor
 garibi ek abhishaap he
 This is a punishment
 main poochta hum ki dand prakriya kii kahaan tak prashansa karen, jo anivarytah manushya ko or adhik aparaadh karne ko baadhya kare? kya tumhaare ishwar ne yah nahin sochaa tha yaa usko bhi ye sari baaten maanavtaa dwaara akathaneey kashton ke jhelane kii keemat par anubhav se seekhni thim? tum kya sochate ho, kisi garib yaa anpadh parivaar, jaise ek chamaar yaa mehtar ke yahaan paidaa hone par insaan kaa kya bhagya hoga? chunki vah garib he, isaliye padhai nahin kar saktaa
 He remains despised and abandoned by his peers, who consider themselves elevated due to being born into an upper caste
 uskaa agyaan, uski garibi or usase kiya gaya vyavhaar uske hriday ko samaaj ke prati nishthur bana dete hai
 If he commits a sin, who will bear the consequences? Ishwar, he himself or the saint of society? And what about the punishments of those whom the arrogant Brahmins deliberately kept ignorant and who had to bear the punishment of having to bear a stream of melted lead in their ears because of listening to some sentences of your sacred books of knowledge - the Vedas? If they commit a crime, who will be responsible for it? And who will bear their blow? mere priy doston! ye siddhanth visheshadhikaar yukt logon ke avishkaar hai
 They justify their captured power, capital and highness on the basis of these principles
 aptaan singhlair ne likhaa tha ki manushya ko bas amartv main vishwaas dilaa do or uske baad uski sari sampatti lut lo
 He will help you in this task without raving
 dharm ke upadeshkon or satta ke swaamiyon ke gathbandhan se hi jail, faansee, kode or ye siddhanth upajte hai
 i ask, why doesn't your all-powerful God stop every person when he is committing a sin or a crime? He can do this very easily
 usne kyon nahin ladaaku raajaaon kii ladane kii ugrata ko samaapt kiya or is prakaar vishwayuddh dwaara maanavtaa par padane vaali vipattiyon se use bachaaya? usne angrejon ke mastishk main bharat ko mukt kar dene kii bhaavana kyon nahin paidaa kii? vah kyon nahin puunjipatiyon ke hriday main yah paropkaaree utsaah bhar detaa ki ve utpaadan ke sadhano par apana vyaktigat sampatti kaa adhikaar tyaag den or is prakaar keval sampoorn shramik samudaay, varan samast maanav samaaj ko poonjivadi bediyon se mukt karen? aap samaajwaad kii vyaavhaarikta par tark karnaa chaahate hai
 i leave it to your almighty to enforce it
 jahaan tak saamaanya bhalaai kii baat he, log samaajwaad ke gunon ko maanate hai
 They oppose it with an excuse of not being practical
 paramatma ko aane do or vah cheez ko sahi tareeke se kar de
 The British rule here is not because God wants but because he has power and we do not have the courage to oppose him
 ve hamako apane prabhutv main ishwar kii madad se nahin rakhe hai, balki banduukon, riflon, bam or goliyon, police or sena ke sahare
 It is our apathy that they are successfully committing the most disgraceful crime against society - complete exploitation of one nation by another
 kahaan he ishwar? kya vah manushya jati ke in kashton kaa mazaa le rahaa he? ek nero, ek changez, uskaa naash ho! Do you ask me how do i explain the origin of this world and the origin of man? Ok let me tell you
 chalrs darvin ne is vishay par kuch prakaash daalane kii koshish kii he
 Read it yah ek prakruti kii ghatana he
 Earth formed by accidental mixing of various substances, in the shape of a nebula
 kab? itihaas dekho
 Animals were born from this type of phenomenon and humans in a long period
 darwin kii ‘jeev kii utpatti’ padho
 And then all the development was done by man's constant opposition to nature and the desire to conquer it
 yah is ghatana kii sambhavtah sabase sookshm vyakhya he
 Your second argument could be why a child is born blind or lame? Is it not the result of the work done in his previous birth? Biologists have found a scientific solution to this problem
 avashya hi tum ek or bachakaana prashn puch sakate ho
 If there is no God, then why did people believe in him? My answer is subtle and clear
 jis prakaar ve preton or dusht atmaaon main vishwaas karne lage
 The only difference is that belief in God is universal and philosophy is highly developed
 isaki utpatti kaa shrey un shoshakon kii pratibha ko he, jo paramatma ke astitv kaa upadesh dekar logon ko apane prabhutv main rakhana chaahate the or unase apni vishisht sthiti kaa adhikaar evam anumodan chaahate the
 All religions, sects, sects and other such institutions eventually become the supporters of ruthless and exploitative institutions, individuals and classes
 raja ke viruddh har vidroh har dharm main sadaiv hi paap rahaa he
 After recognizing man's limitations, understanding his weaknesses and demerits, he is tempted to face bravely at the time of examination, to face all the dangers with masculinity and to tie his eruption into prosperity and majesty
 Fantasy existence was created
 apane vyaktigat niyamon or abhibhavakeey udaartaa se purna ishwar kii badha-chadha kar kalpana evam chithran kiya gaya
 He is used as a fear-monger when he discusses his rage and personal rules
 taaki koi manushya samaaj ke liye khatara na ban jaye
 When his guardian qualities are explained, he is used as a father, mother, brother, sister, friend and helper
 jab manushya apane sabhi doston dwaara vishwasghaat or tyaag dene se atyant klesh main ho, tab use is vichaar se santvana mil sakati he ki ek sadaa sachcha dost uski sahaayta karne ko he, usko sahaara degaa or vah sarvashaktimaan he or kuch bhi kar saktaa he
 In fact it was useful for the society in the primitive period

 main poochta hum tumhaara sarvashaktishaalee ishwar har vyakti ko kyon nahin us samay roktaa he jab vah koi paap yaa aparaadh kar rahaa hota he? yah to vah bahut aasaani se kar saktaa he
 Why didn't he end the fighting rage of the fighting kings and thus save him from the plagues of humanity by the world war? Why did he not evoke the feeling of liberating India in the British mind? Why wouldn't it fill the benevolent zeal in the hearts of the capitalists to relinquish their right to personal property over the means of production and thus only liberate the entire working community, but the entire human society, from the capitalist fetters? You want to argue the practicality of socialism
 main ise aapke sarvashaktimaan par chhod detaa hum ki vah lagu kare
 As far as general good is concerned, people regard the virtues of socialism

 chalrs darvin ne is vishay par kuch prakaash daalane kii koshish kii he
 Read it yah ek prakruti kii ghatana he
 Earth formed by accidental mixing of various substances, in the shape of a nebula
 kab? itihaas dekho
 Animals were born from this type of phenomenon and humans in a long period
 darwin kii ‘jeev kii utpatti’ padho
 And then all the development was done by man's constant opposition to nature and the desire to conquer it
 yah is ghatana kii sambhavtah sabase sookshm vyakhya he
 Your second argument could be why a child is born blind or lame? Is it not the result of the work done in his previous birth? Biologists have found a scientific solution to this problem
 avashya hi tum ek or bachakaana prashn puch sakate ho
 If there is no God, then why did people believe in him? My answer is subtle and clear
 jis prakaar ve preton or dusht atmaaon main vishwaas karne lage
 The only difference is that belief in God is universal and philosophy is highly developed
 isaki utpatti kaa shrey un shoshakon kii pratibha ko he, jo paramatma ke astitv kaa upadesh dekar logon ko apane prabhutv main rakhana chaahate the or unase apni vishisht sthiti kaa adhikaar evam anumodan chaahate the
