 The festive season is going on and you have taken railway tickets to go to your home, but the passengers who have received waiting tickets are not sure whether it will be confirmed or not
 lekin ab bhartiya rail ek aisa plan lekar ai he jisase aapke vatting tikat ke conform hone kii sambhaavna bad gai he
 In fact, the railways, which is facing increasing number of passengers, has decided to increase the capacity of its large trains including prestigious trains like Rajdhani, Shatabdi and Duronto
 uttar railway ke ek adhikari ne bataaya ki bheed kam karne ke liye trivendrum, chennai or guwahati jane vaali rajdhani trainon main atirikt dibbe jode gaye hai
 Not only this, Bhopal and Lucknow Shatabdi services have also been enhanced by adding more chair coaches

 Apart from this, the plan also is that additional coaches will be added in trains like delhi-udhampur Express, Amritsar Saharsa Express and Ambala Muzaffarnagar Express
 adhikari ke anusaar tyohaar ke is sijan main bheed kam karne ke liye dilli elahabaad express, chandigarh katihaar express jaisi vishesh trainen chalaayi ja rahi hai
 The special thing is that the railways has been putting extra bogies to confirm instant waiting tickets but this is the first time that the railways have planned to add extra coaches in almost all major trains
 petrol ke daam aasmaan chune par bahes jaise-jaise tikhi hoti ja rahi he, vaise hi logon kii raay bhi banty najar aati he ki iske liye koun jimmedaar he? purv vitt mantri pi chidambaram kaa daawa he ki centre sarkaar chaahati to petrol ke daam 25 rupye prati litre tak kam kar sakati thi agar ye crude oil kii kam keemton kaa laabh aam aadmi ko dena chaahati
 BJP supporters retorted that in reality it was the UPA government, which in its ten-year rule, set fire to people's pockets with petrol prices

 BJP supporters want to say through the picture that during the UPA, petrol prices had increased much faster
 ye sandesh kahata he- ‘asuvidhajanak tathy’- 2014-18 ke bich petrol ke daam har saal 90 paise hi bade
 Whereas, during the 10 years of UPA, petrol increased by an average of 4 rupees every year

 com / gwq9c3tacs— Amit Malviya (@amitmalviya)may 22, 2018pehali najar me dekhen to data bada aasaan or asardaar lagata he
 But when it was analyzed in depth, it came out that the claim is not only misleading but only half true
 petrol kii keemten alag-alag rajyon main alag-alag hoti hai lekin bijepi ke sandesh main petrol kii keemten dete hue kisi shahar kaa hawala nahin diya gaya he
 For comparison, we analyzed the fluctuations of petrol prices in Delhi in the last 14 years
 petroleum mantralay se jude petroleum planning and analysis cell se crude oil kii keemten or petrol kii retail keemton kaa data liya gaya
 In May 2004, when UPA 1 came to power and Manmohan Singh became Prime Minister, the price of petrol in Delhi was 33
 71 rupee prati litre thi
 On the other hand, when Narendra Modi took power in May 2014, Petrol 71 in Delhi
 41 rupee prati litre bik rahaa tha
 That is, the price of petrol had increased by Rs 38 in a span of ten years
 iskaa matlab upie ke kaarykaal main petrol kii keemat har saal ausatan 3
 80 rupees per liter
 yahaan tak to amit malviya kaa daawa sahi lagata he
 But looking at the retail prices of petrol separately, the discrepancy in itself is two things important in deciding the prices of petrol and diesel - crude oil (crude oil) prices and taxes of the central and state governments
 agar taxon ko naa badla jaae to petrol or dijal kii keemten sidhe sidhe crude oil kii keemton main hone vaale utaar-chadhaav kii tarah hi upar-neeche hongi
 While taxes are decided by the central and state governments, the prices of crude oil depend on the international market and the exchange rate of the currency over which the government has little control
 aise main kisi vakt main petrol kii retail keemton kaa sahi akalan tabhi kiya ja saktaa he jab us vakt kii crude oil kii keemton ko bhi dhyaan main rakhaa jaae
 For this, we also studied the prices of crude oil in the last 14 years
 isamen upie ke donon kaarykaal or modi sarkaar kaa chaar saal kaa kaarykaal bhi shaamil he
 Crude oil prices were derived based on the average of daily prices for the entire financial year
 saath hi america dollar kii tulana main bhartiya rupee kii exange dar kaa bhi dhyaan rakhaa gaya
 Similarly, retail prices of petrol in Delhi were also averaged for the whole year
 in do inputs ke aadhaar par taiyaar kiye gaye graph kii tulana se sahi tasviir saamne aati he ki kis tarah upie or modi sarkaar ne petrol kii keemton ko handle kiya
 If two graphs are seen then the first white graph shows crude oil prices and the second gray graph shows the retail prices of petrol
 agar tex ek samaan hote to aapako graph kii do line bhi ek jaise hi pattern main dikhti
 
 
 
 beete 14 saal main crude oil kii keemten 2004 main sabase kam thim jab upie satta main aayaa tha lekin upie 2 ke kaarykaal main ye 112 dollar prati bairal ke oonche str par bhi gaya
 (here is talking about the average price for the whole year
 jab crude kii keemat 112 dollar prati bairal ke oonche str tak bhi gai to bhi petrol kii retail keemat 65
 76 per liter
 petrol keemat ab 77 rupee ke sabase oonche str ko chhu rahi he jab crude oil kii keemat 86 dollar prati bairal ke aasapaas chal rahi he
 This is still the highest average price of crude at $ 112 to $ 25
 crude kii sabase zyada keemat kaa manmohan singh sarkaar ko 2011-12 main saamana karnaa padaa tha
 It is clear from the graph that crude oil prices (white line) started falling down after the start of the Modi government's term
 2015-16 main ye 46 dollar prati bairal ke str tak neeche aa gai thi
 But the Modi government decided to keep the petrol retail prices at the same level
 iske liye petrol par kendriya utpaada shulk lagaataar badhaayaa jaataa rahaa
 9
 48 rupye prati litre se ye badhkar janvari 2016 main 21
 48 reached the highest level of Rs per liter
 jab crude oil kii keemton ne phir badhanaa shuru kiya to utpaada shulk ko 4 oktober 2017 ko do rupee prati litre gata diya gaya
 These 19 since then
 48 rupee prati litre ke str par bana hua he
 Talking of the last four years after the end of UPA 2 term, the excise duty in petrol has increased by 126% and on diesel by 330%
 haalanki petrol par tex lagaakar kamai karne ke maamle main rajya sarkarein bhi centre sarkaar se peeche bilkul nahin raheen
 Talking about Delhi, the condition is that VAT 12 in March 2010
 5 pratishat tha wo ab badhata-badhata 27 fisadi tak pahunch chukaa he
 Delhi is one of the states that not only collect VAT on petrol, but also earn commission by levying VAT separately on the commission received by the dealer
 aise main jo koi bhi aapse ye kahata he ki beete chaar saal main petrol kii keemten 90 paise prati varsh kii dar se badi hai to wo aapako ardhsaty hi bataata he
 The inconvenient fact is that if the Modi government did not change the central excise duty much after coming to power, then according to the current prices of crude oil, people in Delhi still have to loose only Rs 65 per liter for petrol

 Before the announcement of Lok Sabha election dates, Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the Kisan Samman Nidhi scheme in Gorakhpur on Sunday in which 2 thousand rupees of the first installment of 6 thousand rupees annually to 13 crore farmers of the country
 Issued
 akele uttar pradesh main kareeb paune do karod kisaanon ke khate main yah raashi aegi jisamen se kaiyon ke khate main 2 hajaar kii pehali kisht pahunch bhi chuki he or baakiyon ko apane khate main paise kaa intjaar bhi he
 What is the opinion of the farmers in Uttar Pradesh on this Samman Nidhi Yojana of the Central Government and how the farmers see this direct to transfer issue of the Prime Minister, about the mood of the farmers in Uttar Pradesh capital Lucknow and its adjoining city of Barabanki
 And there was an attempt to understand the mood
 barabanki main paise nahin pahunchane se kisaanon kii naarazgikisaanon kii raay jaananeajatkaki team barabanki ke shuklai gaanv pahunchi
 Dozens of farmers of this village have received the first installment of ₹ 2,000 from Prime Minister Modi, although there are still many people who have not yet received this amount
 is gaanv ke kheton main jab ajtak ne in kisaanon se baat kii to zyaadaatar kisaan is baat se santusht najar aae ki pradhanmantri modi ne ek pahal kii he lekin kai is baat se dukhi bhi the ki ab tak na to unke paas paise pahunche hai or naa hi kaiyon ke form bhare gaye hai
 Some farmers in the village near Shuklai village have also been given certificates of the Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana by the government stating that ₹ 6,000 is being given to them under this scheme
 kai kisaanon ne apane mobile par aae esemes bhi hamen dikhaaen
 Most people are waiting for the money to come into their account
 haalanki kai is baat se naaraaz dikhe ki yah yojana mahaj vot for cash jaisi he, or to or rakam itani kam he ki iskaa koi phayda kisaanon ko nahin hone vaala
 Many elderly farmers said that this scheme is much better than the loan waiver scheme and they can use it to buy seeds, patching or fertilizers, but many farmers were angry that such a small amount was of no use
 Because fertilizer and seeds have become so expensive that they will not be able to compensate for this amount
 is dauraan kai kisaanon ne vah form dikhaae jis form ko bhare jane ke baad unka naam is labhaarthi kii list main aayega
 In this form, the farmer has to write the name, caste, Aadhaar number, mobile number and his land records
 jis kisaan ke paas 2 hectare yani 20 bigha se kam jameen hogi unhen iskaa laabh milegaa
 Right now money has started reaching the people's account and now most of the farmers are hoping that their forms should be filled at the earliest and money will also come in their accounts
 pradhanmantri modi ne gorakhpur ke apane bhaashan main yah kaha tha ki 13 karod logon ko pehali kist ke ₹2,000 die jane hai or shuruyaat hone ke saath hi agle teen se chaar hafton ke bich pehali kist sabhi kisaanon ke khate main pahunch jaaegi
 Not happy with Lucknow's Kisan Yojana, farmers in Barabanki looked satisfied, but some farmers in the capital Lucknow, especially those associated with farmers' politics, are trying to surround the government on this issue
 lakhanu ke naubasta gaanv main kareeb ek darjan kisaanon se ajtak ne baat kii isamen kai bade kisaan hai to kai chote or majhole kaashtkaar bhi the
 The farmers of Lucknow were not happy with this plan of the government, according to them, the initiative may be good, but the government is advancing anti-farmer policies, according to these farmers, if the government arranges for the purchase of farmers, which they made for the farmers one and a half times Support price promised
 khaad or uria kii keemton ko kam kar de to is ₹6,000 kii sahaayta raashi kii koi jarurat hi nahin padegi or agar sarkaar ko sahaayta raashi deni he to kam se kam 20 se 25,000 dena chahie taaki kisaanon kaa kuch bhala ho sake
 However, Prime Minister Modi has a mixed reaction among farmers about this scheme
 zyaadaatar kisaan apane khate main paise kaa intjaar kar rahe hai, lekin raajnneetik taur par kai dalon se jude kisaan iskaa virodh bhi kar rahe hai
 According to him, this is a matter of vote for cash and after the elections, the government will also stop it

 purv bispi netaa swami prasad maury somvaar ko amit shah kii maujuudagi main bhartiya janata party main shapath lekar shaamil ho gaye
 On 22 June, Maurya resigned from the BSP after accusing Mayawati of selling tickets
 istife ke baad mayawati ne maury ke aaropon kaa jawaab dete unhen party se nishkashit kar diya tha
 Keshav Maurya was not in favor of including Swamy in the party
 In the last month and a half, UP BJP in-charge Om Prakash Mathur Neswami Prasad Mauryaki twice met BJP President Amit Shah
 maury bijepi main aaen iskaa puraa taana bana om maathur ne buna he
 Om Mathur is well aware that UP BJP President Keshav Prasad Maurya did not want Swami Prasad Maurya to join BJP at all
 kurmi vot par swami kaa prabhavasutron kii maane to upi bijepi adhyaksh ne swami ko lekar apni naaraazgi kendriya netritv ko bataa di he
 Even after Keshav Maurya's displeasure, the party is betting on the former BSP leader because the party leadership feels that Swami Prasad Maurya is a bigger leader of his Kurmi caste than Keshav Maurya and has more influence on Kurmi voters
 om maathur ye baat achche se jaanate he ki upi main kurmi jati ke lagbhag 6 pratishat vot bank he, jiskaa purvi uttar pradesh kii 100 se zyada siton par acha khaasaa prabhaav he
 Swami had no way left After leaving the BSP, Swami Prasad Maurya first considered forming his own party, and planned to go to UP Vidhan Sabha elections like his own party in alliance with the BJP
 lekin swami ke is plan ko amit shah or om maathur ne manjuuri nahin di
 Maurya had also approached the Congress and the Samajwadi, but the matter did not materialize
 uske baad unhone araspi adhyaksh upendra kushvaha ke saath upi chunaav main jane kaa man banaaya tha, lekin upendra kushvaha ne bijepi ke dabaav main apana haath waapas khinch liya
 After this, Swami Prasad Maurya had the only option left to join the BJP
 bijepi ne lakh koshishon ke baad ek bada kaich pakadaa he
 But one thing the BJP leadership must keep in mind is that before the Bihar elections, a similar match was won by the Jitau catch BJP, as Jeetan Ram Manjhi
 jiskaa chunaav main phayda kam nuksaan zyada hua tha

 bihar main jediu or bijepi kii sarkaar banane ke baad pradesh congress main asantosh kaa maahaul he or party main tut lagbhag tay he
 According to sources, most of the 27 Congress mlas are preparing to leave the party and join the JDU
 guuruuvaar ko congress kaa siyaasi sankat us vakt or gaharaa gaya jab jediu ne baagi congressi vidhayakon ko party chhodkar jediu main shaamil hone kaa nyotaa de diya
 Significantly, there is still 3 years left in elections in Bihar and most of the 27 Congress mlas do not want to play the role of opposition in the Congress, but their intention is to taste the power by joining JDU
 baagi congressi netaaon ko jediu main shaamil hone kaa nyotaa dete hue jediu pravaktaa sanjay kumaar singh ne kaha ki nitish kumaar kii party aise baagi congressiyon ko apane party main shaamil karaane ke liye bilkul taiyaar he
 It is important to know here that since the formation of the new government in Bihar, there has been a fierce situation in the state Congress
 pradesh congress main mache ghamaasan ko shant karne ke liye party upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ne sabhi vidhayakon se mulaakaat bhi kii magar iske baavjood sankat tala nahin
 The Congress mlas are angry that their party's alliance with the RJD in Bihar has proved to be harmful for the Congress over the years
 congress vidhayak ajit kumaar sharma or parshad dilip kumaar choudhary ne saaf taur par rahul gandhi se kah diya he ki bihar main lalu prasad kii party ke saath gathbandhan tode bina 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke liye congress ko majboot nahin kiya ja saktaa
 The resentment of the state Congress leaders is also due to the fact that at that time there was instability in Bihar on the allegations of corruption against former Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi
 us vakt bhi kendriya congress ke kisi netaa ne patna aakar mahagathbandhan ko bachaane kii koshish nahin kii
 On the other hand, Bihar Pradesh Congress President Ashok Chaudhary is also angry with the party high command and has alleged that some big leaders of the Congress are conspiring to remove him from his post

 4 years have passed since the Nirbhaya incident in Delhi, but it is still alive in all our hearts
 nirbhaya gangrape cese ne sadak se sansad tak or desh se duniya tak, har jagah tahalaka machaa diya
 At the completion of its four years, Aaj Tak had a special conversation with Nirbhaya's parents
 pesh he unase hui baatcheet ke khaas ansh
 
 
 Question- When the movement took place four years ago, thousands of people from all over the country were standing with you, but today there are not even 200 people on Nirbhaya Chetna Day? - Both regret and regret that people are no longer together
 jo 4 saal pehle thea, kyonki unhen pataa he ki 4 saal pehle jo danda khaae the
 It did not yield any results, but we have not been able to find it yet
 sawaal- lekin kuch badla kyon nahin samaaj main aaj bhi?-5 saal mesarkarbdal jaati he, lekin 4 saal me nirbhaya ko abhi tak nyaay nahin mila
 Society does not need to change and improve the judicial system right now
 shame or dar samaaj se khatm ho gaye hai
 That is why change is not coming
 sawaal- kisi bhi aaropee ko faansee nahin hui ab tak, jabaki ye kaaphi bade media main cover kiya gaya maamla he?-har baar court main ramayana or mahabharat kii tarah puure cese ko bataaya jaataa he, lekin sach to ye he ki aaj bhi aropiyon main se kisi ko faansee nahin hui he
 Due to this the other criminals also get encouragement that one or two years will remain in jail, some one will save and then come out and commit the same crime
 sawaal- 4 saal baad nirbhaya ko kaise yaad kar rahe he aaj aap?-nirbhayako hamane aaj bhi photo par phool maala nahin pahanaai he, kyonki wo samaaj or hamaare dil main jinda he or hameshaa rahegi
 There is resentment that society remembers our memory on December 16 itself
 ye bhi badalane kii jarurat he
 Question- Even after Nirbhaya there has been no change in the attitude of the society nor in the cases of rape? - Whenever such incidents happen, only the children are questioned
 ham log to phir bhi lard rahe hai, lekin kya sarkaar ne apni jimmedaari nibhaai? kya nyaay vyavastaane apana kaam jimmedaari se kiya? jab tak ye nahin hoga kuch nahin badalane vaala, lekin ham phir bhi ladate rahenge

 Nigeria, the country of the continent of Africa, has once again been the victim of violence
 uttari nigeria main bandookdhaariyon ke hamale main 32 logon ke maare jane kii khabar he
 Apart from this, many people are injured, who are being treated in a nearby hospital
 abhi yah saaf nahin ho paaya he ki is hamale main kis sanghathan kaa haath he
 It is being told that some unidentified motorcycle-riding gunmen fired indiscriminately near Kwara village in Shinkafi district of Jamfara State
 jisamen kai logon kii jaan chali gai
 Local sources say that we have found the bodies of 32 people of a monitoring group after the criminal gang attack
 aage unhone kaha ki marane vaale kii taadaad badhane kii ashanka he kyonki kai log ab bhi laapata hai
 Jamfara State Police spokesman Mohammed Shehu has confirmed the attack
 vahiin, kware nivasee alu vaadatau ne bataaya ki is hamale main maare gaye log milisha bal ke sadsy hai jo ilaake main kaarobaariyon ko suraksha muhaiyaa karaata he
 According to the villagers, the attacking gunmen were in full military uniform, but members of the Milisha force lost their lives due to the large number of attackers and shelling
 yahaan par kai saal se vidrohi sanghathan sakriy hai, jise lekar aksar golabari or hamalon kii ashanka bani rahati he
 It is not yet known which extremist organization these attackers are from because the Jamfara State Police spokesperson has refused to provide more information
 bataa den ki abhi kuch hi din pehle kshetra ke chaar gaanvon main hue aatanki hamale main 27 logon kii maut ho gai thi
 Which was attacked by about 400 armed rebels
 asaram kii sabase badi raajadaar, asaram ke liye ladakiyon ko samparn karaane vaali sabase badi hathiyaar, shilpi aakhir maheene bhar kii luka-chuphi ke baad khud hi saamne aa gai or adaalat ke saamne samarpan kar diya
 Now obviously with the dedication of Shilpi, the truth of all the girls who surrender to Asaram will start coming out one by one
 yani yah tay he ki aane vaale din asaram ke liye or bhi musiibat bhare hai
 Asaram was jailed and Shilpi escaped before that
 shilpi kii talash main police behad shiddat ke saath jute gai lekin shilpi kis bill main jaakar chup gai police bhi iskaa pataa nahin laga pai lekin ab maheene bhar baad shilpi khud hajir hui or jodhpur kii jila adaalat main sarender kar diya
 Within 10 minutes of the advance bail being rejected by the High Court, Shilpi surrendered in the court: At two and a half hours, the bail petition of Shilpi was rejected from the High Court and at 3
40 minutes, Shilpi surrendered herself to the police
 18 sitambar ko shilpi ne hoicourt main jamaanat yachika daayar kii thi jabaki usase pehle seshan court se shilpi kii jamaanat yachika khaarij ho chuki thi
 Asaram has been accused of sexual exploitation since the day, every day there is a big disclosure
 aasthaa kaa safed chola odhane vaale asaram ko kalank kaa keechad har roj or zyaada kaala kar rahaa he
 Now every person has come under the control of the police who used to be around Baba twenty four hours
 pehle sevadaar shiva, phir rasoiyaa prakaash or chhindwara ashram kaa diarector sharat chandra or ab asaram kii kareebi shilpi bhi police kii giraft main he
 Apparently, the episodes of Asaram's case will be reunited
 asaram ke ird gird saae kii tarah rahanewaalon kaa aamanaa-saamana hoga
 Then the king will also open big
 yani asaram kii museebaton kaa nayaa countdown ab shuru hua he
 Asaram is in judicial custody till 1 October
 police chargeshit taiyaar karne main juty he
 Now Asaram will survive or go to jail, everyone's eyes are on it
 agar peedit ladki kaa aarope sahi he or jodhpur police kii tafteesh sach to yakeen maniye shilpi hi wo ladki he jo asaram ke gurukul main padhane vaali ladakiyon ko asaram ke saamne samarpan karne ke liye taiyaar karti thi
 According to the Jodhpur Police Asaram, Shilpi was made the warden of his Gurukal for this purpose
 shilpi kaa pehle faraar hona, phir loar court main jamaanat kii arji dena or tab arzi khaarij hone par hai court ke darvaaze par dastak dena kaaphi kuch kahata he
 After all, what is the reason that Shilpi was still avoiding facing the police and the law in that case, in which case her master Asaram himself got into a big house
 police kii maane to shilpi hi wo ladki he, jisane naa sirf is ladki ko asaram ke saamne pesh karne kii puri zamin taiyaar kii thi, balki or bhi ladakiyon kaa asaram ke saamne samarpan ke liye taiyaar kiya tha or asaram ne shilpi ko sirf isi iraade se haridwar ke ashram se nikaal kar chhindwara ke apane gurukul main warden bana kar bheja tha
 Shilpi went, she even talked to the girl but when the girl was not ready to go in front of Asaram, she prepared a new story to present the girl to Asaram
 police ke mutabik ye kahani thi bhoot pret or beemaari kii
 Actually, it was Shilpi who prepared a plan to introduce her alone to Asaram by saying that the girl was possessed by a ghost ghost and when the girl stepped back, she took the girl's parents in a lurch
 chunki ladki ke maa-baap pehle hi asaram ke bhakt the, wo is prastaav ko thukraa nahin sake or is ek hami ne puure parivaar kii zindagi badal lee
 But according to the police, this is not the first and only handiwork of a craftsman, but instead of this girl, the craftsman has woven a lot of fabric to present several girls to Baba in the same way
 itnaa hi nahin wo asaram kii tathakthith beemaari, nashe kii aadat or duusare sahi-galat dhandhon se bhi pardaa ho hataa sakati he or ab der se hi sahi, shilpi police or kaanoon ke paas pahunch chuki he
 In such a situation, it is to be seen how many and how the police can get the black secret of his master from the craftsman
 sanchita gupta urf shilpi kuch saal pehle tak ek maamuli ladki thi lekin wo asaram ke sampark main kya ai dekhte hi dekhte usne farsh se arsh tak kaa safar puraa kar liya lekin ab takadir kaa pahiyaa ek baar phir se ghumaa he or baba ke saath ab shilpi ke sitare bhi gardish main hai
 Although Shilpi was the warden of the girls' hostel of Asaram's Chidwara ashram school, but it is said that she was the architect of Asaram's worldly bliss
 ek aisi saheli jo baba asaram kii kunthaon kii kahaniyon kii saajheedaar thi, jo asaram kii giraftaar ke baad se na jane kahaan gaayab ho gai thi
 Sanchita Gupta aka Shilpi, who not only implicated girls for Asaram, but also enticed them to surrender themselves to Asaram
 asaram par yon shoshan kaa aarope lagane vaali naaballig ladki ko bhi shilpi ne hi sabase pehle bahakaaya or bharamaaya tha
 It was Shilpi who caused a sickness in the mind of the girl who accused Asaram of sexual harassment
 asaram kii sadhika, saheli or saajheedaar, usee ne bacchee ke man main thuns-thuns kar ye samajhaayaa tha ki tumhaari dimagi haalat thik nahin he or is beemaari kaa upachaar sirf asaram ke paas he
 As soon as the entire case was revealed and Asaram went to jail, his friend, the Rajdar Shilpi, who knew the truth of his many crimes, suddenly disappeared, while the Jodhpur police had taken out a warrant for Shilpi before Asaram
 use 29 agast tak peshi kii mohalat di gai thi lekin police asaram ke dhyaan main aisi magan hui ki shilpi kabutar kii tarah furr ho gai thi or ab jab wo police ke haath lagi he to jaahir he kai or hairaan karne vaale raaj khulenge
 First private servant Siva, then director of Chhindwara Ashram Sharat Chand, followed by cook Prakash and now most importantly Mohra artisan
 ye sab sirf naam nahin hai balki hakeekat main ye sab asaram kii musiibat hai kyonki yahi wo raajadaar hai jo jaise-jaise raaj ugalenge asaram kii jail yatra lambii hoti jaaegi
 Asaram and his son Narayan Sai had said that the victim girl was mentally ill but in a statement to the police, her Chhindwara Gurukul director Sharat Chandra said that the victim had no illness
 wo ladki ashram kii warden shilpi ke sampark main thi or vahi jaanati he ki kya beemaari thi
 It was only after Asaram received instructions from the Ahmedabad ashram that he hired Shilpi aka Sanchita Gupta
 sharatchand ke bayanon kii pushti or isse jude subooton ko ikattha karne ke liye jodhpur police sharatchand ko lekar chhindwara gurukul pahunchi
 On the other hand, Asaram's cook Prakash also revealed in question that i used to keep Asaram's mobile phone
 peedita ko jodhpur madi kutiyaa main laane ke liye shilpi, sharat chandra or shiva kaa phone aayaa tha
 Asaram himself knew in advance that the victim was coming to Madai Kutia and arrangements were made for this
 asaram kisi ladki yaa mahila ko choote the to koi virodh nahin karata tha balki sari ladkiyaan samarpan ke liye hi aati thim
 Food security bill is expected to be uproar in Parliament on Tuesday
 upie sarkaar ne food bill samet kai muddon par sahmati banane karne ke liye sarvadaleey baithak bulaai he
 On one hand, BJP has announced its support for this bill, on the other hand, Gujarat CM Narendra Modi has expressed reservations on some points in the current draft of the food bill
 modi chaahate hai ki is mudde par sabhi mukhyamantriyon kii baithak bulaai jaae
 For this, he has also written a letter to the Prime Minister
 modi ne manmohan singh ko patr main likhaa he ki yah ek aisa mudda he ki jisase centre or rajya sarkaron donon kaa vaasta he
 Modi has alleged in the letter that poor families have been made a 'food reserve' through an ordinance which does not fulfill the basic objectives of food security
 ’ unhone saat agast kii tithi vaale patr main aarope lagaaya he ki adhyadesh ke tahat ‘avyavhaarya vaidhanik jimmedaariyaan centre or rajya sarkaron ko di gai hai’ or ‘labhaarthiyon kii sankhya paatrata ke maandand or vyaktigat adhikaar tay kiye bina tay kar di gai he
 There can be wide regional disparities between different states
 ’modi ke anusaar sansad kii sthaayee samiti ne janvari 2013 main sifarish kii thi ki sarkaar ko rajya sarkaar se salaah mashvira karke paatrata maandand tay karne chahie
 He said that the ordinance proposed reducing the entitlement of families living below the poverty line from 35 kg per family to 25 kg for an average five-person family
 unhone kaha, ‘yah khaadya suraksha vidheyak kaa uddeshy nahin ho saktaa jo un logon kaa haq ghataata he jinaki pahchaan garibi rekha ke neeche rahane vaale ke rup main hui he
 He said that on the other hand the Planning Commission is claiming that the number of BPL families has decreased but under the ordinance there is a matter of providing food assistance to two-thirds of the population
 is par rajyon se charchaa honi chahie

 Priyanka's aggressive mode against Yogi can also be gauged from the fact that he has made 4 against Yogi Sarkar in his total 12 tweets so far
 uttar pradesh ke shikshamitron kii mehnat kaa rose apmaan hota he, saikadon peediton nen aatmahatya kar daali

 com / ebeynst3va — Priyanka Gandhi Vadra (@priyankagandhi) March 25, 2019 On January 23, 2019, Priyanka Gandhi knocked on Twitter in February after being appointed as Congress General Secretary
 iske baad unhone newjiland main hamalaa, manohar parrikar kii maut or holi ke maukey par twit kiye
 So far she has not said anything against PM Narendra Modi in a single tweet, but since Sunday morning she has been continuously tweeting back-to-back against Yogi Adityanath
 ravivaar subah ganna kisaanon ke bakaayaa bhugtan kaa mudda uthaane ke baad unhone raat ke vakt anganbari kaaryakarta or sahayikaon kaa mudda uthaaya
 He wrote that the Anganwadi workers and assistants of UP are demanding the status of the state employee, but instead of listening to their suffering, the BJP government used sticks on them
 meri bahanon kaa sangharsh, meraa sangharsh he
 Soon after, she shared a picture with the hopefuls and wrote that those who take care of the health of pregnant women get Rs 600
 lekin bhaajapa sarkaar ne kabhi unki sud nahin lee
 After this aggressiveness of Priyanka, CM Yogi Adityanath also had to come into the fray
 unhone bhi twit ke jariye priyanka ko jawaab die
 After tweeting the payment of sugarcane farmers with Priyanka to Priyanka Gandhi on Sunday, Yogi Adityanath has now given a direct reply to Priyanka Gandhi on the issue of Asha workers
 yogi ne likhaa he ki congress kii duubati naiyya kii nai khiwaiya bhraamak prachaar se janata ko bargalane main lagi hai
 Where were the well wishers of the Asha sisters till now
 neend khul gayi? yogi ne bataaya ki haal hi main sarkaar ne inke maandey main 750 rupayon kii vruddhi kii ghoshnaa kii he
 Earlier, on the payment of sugarcane farmers, Yogi, while replying to Priyanka Gandhi, had called him 'so-called' friendly
 yogi ne ganna kisaanon kii badahaali ke liye sapa-basapa kii puraani sarkaron ko jimmedaar tehraate hue kaha tha ki jab 2012 se 2017 tak kisaan bhukhmaree kii kagaar par tha, tab ye hitaishi kahaan the, inaki neend ab kyon khuli he? yogi ne kisaanon ko khushhaal bataaya tha, to somvaar kii subah priyanka gandhi ne sabase pehle yogi adityanath ko hi nishane par le liya or ye naye mudde par unhen gher liya
 Taking up the issue of education friends, Priyanka Gandhi tweeted and wrote that the hard work of Shikshamitras is insulted everyday, hundreds of victims committed suicide
 jo sadakon par utre sarkaar ne unpar laathiyaan chalaai, rasuka darj kiya
 BJP leaders are busy marketing T-shirts
 kaash ve apana dhyaan dardamandon kii ore bhi daalate
 In this way he bombarded another issue on the Yogi government and within 24 hours from Sunday morning to Monday morning, he took up four big issues and surrounded the Yogi government
 chunavi drushtikon se priyanka ke is stand ko kaaphi mahatvapurn mana ja rahaa he, kyonki unhen jis purvi upi kaa prabhaar mila he, wo siem yogi kaa garh mana jaataa he
 In such a situation, Priyanka wants to connect herself with the people of the state and their issues by directly targeting them

 Medicines have become so expensive in the country that it has become extremely difficult to buy for poor patients
 lekin ab mumbaivasiyon ko isaki chintaa nahin sataayegi
 a drug bank has opened in Mumbai, where medicines are given free of cost to the needy
 lekin iske liye mumbaivasiyon ko apane ghar rakhi atirikt dawa kaa daan karnaa hoga
 If such medicines are kept in your house too, which are waiting for the expiry date, then you can put it in the donation box of this medicine bank
 yah dawaai bank mumbai ke tata memorial hospital ke thik saamne subah 11 baje se shaam 7 baje tak rakhi hoti he
 If you cannot reach there, call the NGO 'jeevan Jyot', he will send an ambulance-like vehicle to your house and take medicines from your home

 The information about this free service called Medicine Bank, started from January 1, 2014, has so far been limited to the residents of Mumbai
 enjio kii maane, to yahaan na sirf tata memorial hospital ke marij, balki wadiya, nair, keiem or kai nijee aspataal ke marij aate hai
 Now many patients want to avail this service
 khaas baat yah he ki aasapaas maujuud medical dukaane bhi is muft dawaai seva kaa saath de rahi hai
 These shopkeepers believe that medicines and treatment have become so expensive that patients do not even have the money to buy medicines
 gauratlab he ki yah enjio na sirf marijon ko muft davaaiyaan detaa he, balki marijon or unke parivaar ko dopaher or raat kaa muft khaanaa bhi parosata he
 When the Indian Cricket Association (BCCI) decided to conduct the first leg of IPL-7 in the UAE, many questions arose
 khaaskar sharajah cricket stadium main iske aayojan ke baad ipel−7 ko lekar sawaalon kaa daur shuru ho gaya he
 On hearing the name of Sharjah, Javed Miyanadad flashes a six over the last ball in the cricket fans, which has kept the rest of the cricket team and the cricket lovers restless for many years and is still remembered with tees
 bhartiya cricket fans wo match bhi bhul nahin pate jab asia cap ke final main srilanka kii ore se sanath jayasoorya ne 189 Chasing the target of 300 to score and win, the Indian team was all out by scoring 54 runs in the 27th over itself
 match main bharat kii ore se sabase zyada robin singh ne 11 ran banaae
 The Indian team lost by 245 runs
 cricket bollywood or bazaar ko ek saath laane main sharajah ne zarur ahm role adaa kiya, lekin iske saath hi sattebaazi anderworld or match fixing ke saaye main yahaan cricket kii badanaami bhi hui
 The match fixing scandal in the year 2000 tarnished Sharjah's image
 is vivaad ke baad bhartiya sarkaar ne faisalaa lekar team india ke sharajah main khilne par pabandi laga di
 BBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Ague even said that he had been witness to at least a dozen matches there which were fixed
 wo iske liye shapath lene ko taiyaar the, haalanki isisi kii anti karpshan unit kuch sabit nahin kar pai
 The cloud of suspicion about Sharjah always remained
 yahi vajah he ki kirti azaad jaise cricketer ab bhi bisisiai ke is faisale par sawaal uthaane se nahin chook rahe hai
 Kirti Azad said that despite the Mudgal Committee's investigation, she was surprised by the bcci's decision that IPL-7 ke kuch match sanyukt arab emirate main yojit honge
 Kirti says that UAE is a good option, it is a pavilion for fixing
 mujhe puri ummid he ki bisisiai ke kuch adhikari isse behad khush honge
 The Indian team also got permission to play matches in the UAE in 2006, then in recent times apart from other countries under-19 bhartiya team ko bhi yahaan khilne kii ijazat di gai
 Indian team defeated Pakistan in the final of Asia Cup while under 19 world cap main team india paanchaven number par rahi
 Although IPL and BCCI officials are claiming that they will not allow the mistakes of the past year to be repeated in Sharjah, but the UAE and especially in Sharjah will continue to raise questions about the match
 sharajah kii yaaden cricket fans ke liye sirf kadavi nahin hai
 Perhaps the bitterness of Javed Miandad's sixes diminished after 12 years in 1998 when Sachin Tendulkar carried out Operation 'desert Storm' in Sharjah against Australia
 sachin ne us toornament main australia ke kilaaf lagaataar do shatkeey pari kheli or apane 25wein janmdin par apane fans Gave a unique gift to match ke dauraan aae toofaan ne sachin kaa dhyaan nahin bantane diya
 He was also wearing a helmet during the storm
 sachin kii do pariyon ne sachin ko duniya kaa behtareen ballebaaz bana diya
 Shane Warne later admitted that Sachin was his sapanom main aakar daraate rahe
 This innings of Sachin Tendulkar in Operation Desert Storm is definitely a sweet memory of Indian fans, but sharajah main cricket ko aise hi toofaan se guzaranaa hoga
 The players and officials have to remember this
 loksabhaa chunaav main rashtriya janatantric gathbandhan (rajg) kii haar bakawaasabaajon or dhandhebaajon ke kaaran hui
 This assessment is not of anyone but NDA convenor George Fernandes
 jorge ne kaha jo log idhar udhar chil-pil karte rahete hai or raajnneeti ko dhandha banaate hai usee ke kaaran rajg kii haar hui or samprag aage nikal gaya
 George, one of the country's senior leaders, agrees that the bjp's negative publicity, personal attacks on Manmohan Singh and the Varun Gandhi episode have contributed to the defeat of the NDA
 is bare main sawaal par unhone kaha aisa nahin hona chahie tha
 George Fernandes rebelled against the Janata Dal (U) and contested the Lok Sabha elections from Muzaffarpur and lost his bail
 ise ve apane akalan kii galati maanate hai
 At the same time, JD (U) President Sharad Yadav and Chief Minister Nitish Kumar are not ready to get excited due to their party's tremendous success in Bihar
 bihar kii 40 main se 20 siton par jad (you) or 12 par bhaajapa jiti he
 His response to this victory was i have nothing to say
 yahaan tak ki jorge apane hi sarkaar kii peeth bhi thapthapaane ko taiyaar nahin hai
 On the functioning of Nitish Kumar-led government in Bihar, he said, "people come to me and say that their problems and troubles are not going away
" jis acchhee disha main sarkaar ko janaa chahie tha aisa dikhaai nahin de rahaa he
 Bihar Chief Ministers Nitish Kumar and Sharad Yadav had offered to make George Fernandes a Rajya Sabha member, refusing to contest the Lok Sabha elections due to his age and health
 parantu jorge nahin maane
 With reference to this, when asked whether he was advised not to contest elections even by family members and benefactors
 tab furnandis ne kaha ki rajya sabha main kabhi nahin jaaoongaa, marate dam tak nahin jaaoongaa
 George, who once stirred people up with his speeches, is no longer able to speak his words fluently
 jab unase poocha gaya ki aisi khabaren hai ki kuch logon ne aapako chunaav ladane kii salaah dekar apni nijee swaarth siddhi kii he to jorge furnandis ne kaha kuch logon ne aisa kiya he
 This is perfectly fine
 unhone kaha raajnneeti main jo bhi vyakti aata he vah marate dam tak usase alag nahin hota he
 Many people are running a business in the name of politics
 For me, this country is a medium of service
 jab unase poocha gaya ki chunavi haar ke baad jivan kii sandhya vela main jorge furnandis kya karenge to unhone kaha ladate rahenge, desh ke liye
 People are watching where the people in power have taken the country
 log jald hi iskaa jawaab denge

 How will the solution come out? Rajnath Singh said that no one is ready to talk or tell solution in the wave of protest in the country

 rahul ne kaha ki desh ke sabase amir 15-20 logon kaa karja piem maaf karenge, lekin garib kisaanon kaa karja maaf nahin karenge
 Rahul said that when the common man was standing in line at the time of demonetisation, these rich people took all the money from the back door in the bank

 Apart from this, efforts will be made to give a message against the 'atmosphere of fear, hatred and violence' in the country

 The deceased student was playing in his house at the time of the incident
 ghatana ke baad chaatr ke ghar main koharaam machaa hua he
 The police have conducted the post-mortem by taking the dead body
 ab aage kii jaanch kii ja rahi he
 The case is from Nandanagari area of delhi
 jahaan mithai kii dukaan chalaane vaale purushottam apni patni, putr or do betiyon ke saath rahete hai
 His 14-year-old son was a Class VII student in a school
 beeti shaam kareeb 4 baje vah tution se lautakar ghar aayaa tha
 At that time his mother and both sisters were on the second floor of the house
 jabaki vah ghar ke ground floor par khel rahaa tha
 After some time, when his mother and sister came down, the ground slipped from under his feet
 unhone dekha ki baccha pankhe par faansee par lataka hua tha
 He had a stool lying around
 mana ja rahaa he ki vah ghar main khel rahaa tha
 Then he stood on the stool and put a scarf in the ceiling fan and at the same time he fell from the stool and hanged himself
 soochna milte hi mritak ke pita or police maukey par pahunch gaye
 The police took the child Keshav and sent him for post-mortem
 postmortem ho jane ke baad uskaa shav gharavaalon ko saunp diya gaya
 However, the police is still investigating the case
 bharat main aaj bhi immergency kaa andeshaa bachaa hua he or maujuuda raajnneetik maahaul main aise kavach nahin dikh rahe jo ise roak saken
 In an interview to the Indian Express, senior BJP leader LK Advani said this when an uproar started in the political corridors
 bijepi ne fouran safai di ki ye kisi netaa ke khilaaf ishaara nahin he
 However, in this rhetoric like Advani's talk started to be confirmed
 subrahmanyam swami ne yahaan tak kah diya ki advini ek buddhijivi netaa hai or unki baat par vichaar karne ke liye bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ko party ke 25-30 netaaon kii baithak bulani chaiye
 In fact, just before the completion of thirty years of Emergency, Advani said in an interview published in the Indian Express - Despite the constitutional and legal safeguards, the forces which can crush democracy are currently strong; There does not appear to be any assurance that the civil rights will not be dismissed or dismissed again; i do not say that political leadership is not mature, but weaknesses do not lead to trust; In Indian politics, i do not find marks that give credence to any specific aspect of leadership
 ' Experts believe that Lal Krishna Advani has raised questions about the bjp's current leadership capability and its functioning in gestures
 haalanki wo ye maanate hai ki pichley chalis saal main halaat badale hai or maujuuda halaat main kisi bhi political leadership ke liye media ko niyantrit karnaa sambhav nahin hoga
 The comments adwani ke is bayaan se bijepi ke virodhiyon ko sidhe sarkaar par hamalaa bolne kaa mauqaa mil gaya he
 When Congress leader Ajay Maken questioned the working style of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Nitish Kumar said that Advani is the most senior leader and his statement should be taken very seriously
 jabaki sipiem mahasachiv seetaram yechuri ne kaha ki unki party pehle se sarkaar ke taanaashaahee rukh par sawaal uthaati rahi he
 Amidst all this, Arvind Kejriwal has tweeted that it is feared that the first use of Emergency will be done in Delhi
 Of course, Advani has waged a big debate and is also surrounded by his own government, which is accused of weakening the institutions
 bijepi ne fouran safai di ki ye kisi netaa ke khilaaf ishaara nahin he
 However, in this rhetoric like Advani's talk started to be confirmed
 subrahmanyam swami ne yahaan tak kah diya ki advini ek buddhijivi netaa hai or unki baat par vichaar karne ke liye bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ko party ke 25-30 netaaon kii baithak bulani chaiye
 In fact, just before the completion of thirty years of Emergency, Advani said in an interview published in the Indian Express - Despite the constitutional and legal safeguards, the forces which can crush democracy are currently strong; There does not appear to be any assurance that the civil rights will not be dismissed or dismissed again; i do not say that political leadership is not mature, but weaknesses do not lead to trust; In Indian politics, i do not find marks that give credence to any specific aspect of leadership
 ' Experts believe that Lal Krishna Advani has raised questions about the bjp's current leadership capability and its functioning in gestures
 haalanki wo ye maanate hai ki pichley chalis saal main halaat badale hai or maujuuda halaat main kisi bhi political leadership ke liye media ko niyantrit karnaa sambhav nahin hoga
 The comments adwani ke is bayaan se bijepi ke virodhiyon ko sidhe sarkaar par hamalaa bolne kaa mauqaa mil gaya he

 Of course, Advani has waged a big debate and is also surrounded by his own government, which is accused of weakening the institutions
 darasal immergency ke tees saal puure hone se thik pehle indian express main chape ek intervyuu main adwani ne kaha he - sanvaidhanik or kanoonee suraksha kavchon ke baavjood loktantr ko kuchal sakane vaali taaqatein philhal majboot hai; ye bharosa dilaane vaala koi qadam nahin dikhataa ki phir se naagarik adhikaar kaarij yaa muattal nahin kiye jaaenge; main nahin kahata ki raajnneetik netritv paripakv nahin he, lekin kamazoriyon ke kaaran bharosa nahin hota; bhartiya raajnneeti main mujhe netritv ke kisi vishisht pahalu kaa bharosa dilaane vaale nishaan nahin milte
 ' jaankaar maanate hai ki laal krishna adwani ne ishaaron main bijepi kii maujuuda leadership kii kshamta or uske kaamkaaj ke tareeke par sawaal uthaae hai
 However, he believes that the situation has changed in the last forty years and in the current situation it will not be possible for any political leadership to control the media
 tippaniyan Advani's statement has given the bjp's opponents a chance to attack the government directly
 congress netaa ajay maakan ne pradhanmantri narendra modi kii kaaryastylee par sawaal uthaaai to niteesha kumaar ne kaha ki adwani sabase varisht netaa hai or unke bayaan ko behad gambhirtha se liya janaa chaiye
 While CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury said that his party had been questioning the dictatorial attitude of the government before
 in sabake bich arvind kejariwal ne twit kar ye andeshaa jataayaa he ki immergency kaa pehla prayog kahin dilli main to nahin ho jayega? beshak, adwani ne ek badi bahes chhedi he or iske ghere main unki apni sarkaar bhi he jis par sansthaaon ko kamazor karne kaa ilzaam he

 ) There has been widespread anger on Facebook and Twitter over the statement of an official of the Travancore Devasam Board, the organization that manages the famous Sabarimala temple in Kerala, where hundreds of women are saying they are proud of their bodies
 darasal yuva mahilaon ko sabarimala mandir main jane kii anumati nahin hoti
 Some people say that women are not allowed because they are considered unclean during menstruation
 haalanki kuch duusare vidwaanon kaa kahana he ki bhagwaan ayappa, jinhen yah mandir samarpit he, ko ek brahmacharee yogi mana jaataa he or isi vajah se mandir main mahilaon ke pravesh par roak he
 In support of this practice, Sabarimala Devasam Board head Prayar Gopalakrishnan said that the women will be allowed to enter the temple only when a machine comes in to check that the woman's menstruation is not working
 khabaron ke mutabik, gopalkrishnan ne kaha, 'jis din mandir main mahilaon ke pravesh kaa 'sahi samay' jaanchane vaali mashin ijad ho jaaegi, us din se unhen sabarimala main pravesh kii anumati mil jaaegi
 ' gopalkrishnan kii is tippanee ke khilaaf twitor or fasebuk par coment kii jhadi lag gai, jahaan purush or mahilaayein # happytobleed hashtag ke saath coment kar rahe hai

 kuch logon kaa kahana he ki mahilaon ko isliye anumati nahin he, kyonki masik dharm ke dauraan unhen ashuddh mana jaataa he
 However some other scholars say that Lord Ayyappa, to whom this temple is dedicated, is considered a Brahmachari Yogi and that is why the entry of women into the temple is prohibited

 a case of cheating with about 400 unemployed youths has come to light in Indore through misuse of the name of the Centre's ambitious Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana
 berozegaar yuvaaon ko chuunaa lagane ke aarope main police ne mangalvaar ko 50 varshiya thag ko giraftaar kar liya he
 Additional Superintendent of Police (ASP) Bittu Sehgal told reporters that Janak Mehta (50), who was arrested in the case, is accused of opening a training center here and tricked unemployed youth into believing that his center is affiliated to the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana
 usne kareeb 400 yuvaaon se maheene bhar ke kaushal vikaas prashikshan ke naam par 2000-2000 rupee vasule
 Sehgal said that Mehta implicated the youth in the trap and said that after the completion of the training, they would be given a certificate from the National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) and their fees of Rs 2,000 would be refunded
 lekin is training ke baad yuvaaon ko na to enesdisi kii ore se koi praaanpatr diya gaya, na hi unki jamaa karai fees lautaai gai
 He said that when police investigated on the complaint of some youths who were cheating, it was found that Mehta's training center is not related to the Prime Minister's Skill Development Scheme or NSDC in any way
 is khulaase ke baad mehta ko giraftaar kar liya gaya
 The comments eespi ne bataaya ki mehta mulat: gujarat ke bhavnagar kaa rahane vaala he
 He has been cheated in the name of imparting skill development training to unemployed youth in tribal-dominated Jhabua district of Madhya Pradesh last year
 is maamle main use giraftaar bhi kiya gaya tha
 He was later released on bail
 (is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he

 He collected Rs 2000-2000 in the name of skill development training for a month from 400 youth
 sahagal ne bataaya ki mehta ne yuvaaon ko jaal main fansaate hue kaha ki prashikshan puraa hone ke baad unhen rashtriya kaushal vikaas nigam (enesdisi) kii ore se pramaan patr diya jayega or unki 2,000 rupee kii fees waapas kar di jaaegi
 But after this training, the youth were neither given any certificate from NSDC, nor were their fees deposited
 unhone bataaya ki thagi ke shikaar kuch yuvakon kii shikaayat par jab police ne jaanch kii, to pataa chalaa ki mehta kaa training centre pradhanmantri kaushal vikaas yojana yaa enesdisi se kisi tarah sambaddh hi nahin he

" Used to do ’ullekhneey he ki purv diggaj spin gendbaaj bishan singh bedi ne bhi dilli sarkaar ke aaropon kaa samarthan kiya he, lekin gambhir kaa kahana he ki jetali ne apane kaarykaal ke dauraan cricket ke vikaas ke liye kaaphi kuch kiya he

 He said, "I don't know if there was any kind of corruption or not, i just believe that the present officers should not be there because they never thought of cricket
" pehle sthiti bahut acchhee thi
 Never before has DDCA been as bad as the last two years
 vahaan koi bhi aisa nahin he jiske paas jaakar apni baat rakh sakate ho
 "the rebel tweet was not against Jaitley" Gambhir, Virender Sehwag and some other senior players, unhappy with the sports committee of Delhi and District Cricket Association, had adopted rebel stance against the administration in 2009
 us baghawat ke bare main gambhir ne kaha, ‘hamaara virodh jetali ji ke liye nahin tha, yah didisie anya adhikariyon ke liye tha
 We never took his name
 hamane hameshaa kaha ki jab bhi hamen kisi tarah kii pareshaani hui to ham har cheez ke liye jetali ji ke paas gaye jabaki aisa nahin hona chahie tha
 If you had to go to Jaitley ji for everything, then what was the work of other officers and administrators

 My heart beats for delhi maine dilli ke saath apana kariyar shuru kiya or main dilli ke saath rahakar apana kariyar samaapt karnaa chahta hum kyonki mujhe lagata he ki yah meri gharelu team he or isse mujhe bharat kii taraf se khilne kaa mauka mila
 Whatever the chaos there is or is, it gave me a chance
 ’bharat or pakistan ke bich prastaavit dwipaksheeya siries kaa hona anishchit he or gambhir ne kaha ki is par faisla donon deshon kii sarkaron ko karnaa he
 He said, 'this is a political decision
 bharat or pakistan ke bich siries ke bare main faisla hameshaa sarkarein karti hai or ve hi ise manjuuri detii hai

 Robert Vadra, the son-in-law of the Gandhi family, seems quite active these days
 kabhi wo garibon ko lungar khilaate dikhte hai, hanuman jayanti par hanuman mandir main puja karte hai
 Take time to go to blind school and meet the Divyang
 apane janmdin se pehle balmiki mandir jaakar aashirwad lete hai
 Now on Tuesday, on his birthday, he was seen taking blessings outside his office by cutting cake with poor elderly women and feeding them with an anchor
 in sabhi maukon par robert media ke sawaalon se dur rahane kii koshish karte hai
 But the pictures themselves are posted on social media
 robert ke janmdin se pehle supreme court menshungalu cametiki report saunp di gai
 It was natural that if Robert would come among the poor elderly women, the media questions would also have to be discussed
 haalanki, robert ne apana kaarykram nahin taala, wo aaye kareeb aadha ghanta ruke
 Later remained silent on media questions, but on removing the camera clearly said, "today is my birthday, on this day i do not want to talk to you any more, yes eat cake, thank you for being with me in birthday
 "lekin, robert ke taaja kadam or soshal media par unke dwaara post kii ja rahi tasveeron ke saath hi tamamsamaajik or rajnatik muddonpar lagaataar post ho rahe unke vichaar ek ishaara jarur dete hai
 Is Robert the beginning of a move to politics through social service? After all, Robert had already done a fierce attack on Tarun Vijay regarding the South Indians before the matter arose in Parliament
 aise main janmdin par wo bhale hi apni samajasevi kii chhavi main hi kaid rahanaa chaahate hon, lekin desh ke 12 rajyon main unke vyaktigat or congressi samarthakon ne janmdin ke naam par bade-bade poster lagava die
 Most of the posters posted in 12 states like Punjab, Gujarat, UP, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana, mostly wrote congratulations to Robert as a leader and Robert did not write anything on his Facebook and Twitter
 kahawat yun hi nahin he ki, bina aag ke dhuaan nahin nikalataa
 Overall, Robert turned 48 today on 18 April 2017
 tamaam vivaadon ke bich wo is saal apni chhavi samajasevi ke rup banane kii koshish main lage, haal kii tamaam gatividhiyaan unki siyasat main dilchaspee kii ore sanket to de hi rahi he
 But it is certain that Robert must first overcome the controversies
 aakhir wo hameshaa khud ko bekasoor bataate rahe hai, wo kehete rahe hai ki, kisi adaalat ne unako doshi nahin kaha
 But due to the serious accusations of the opponents, the demand of the time is that they should come forward and openly answer each and every allegation against themselves
 haalanki, unke kareebi kehete hai ki, sirf chunaavon main siyaasi phaayde ke liye un par aarope lagaakar unki or congress kii chhavi par chot kii jaati he varanaa 3 saalon se haryana, rajasthan se lekar centre main bijepi kii sarkaar he, kyon robert ke khilaaf ection lekar unako doshi nahin tehraaya ja sakaa
 Well, this is a political thing
 philhal aaj janmdin ke din to robert kii hamaari taraf se bhi happy berth de! What happened on Monday 9 September 2013 in the country, world, metropolis, sports, economic and Bollywood world

 Now the experts there are claiming that the courage that India is showing against China is actually the result of Modi's growing close proximity with Trump

 This approach contrasts the india-pakistan dispute with the Afghan issue, which may cause further trouble
