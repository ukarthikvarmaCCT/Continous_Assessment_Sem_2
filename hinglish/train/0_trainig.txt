 While working for 35 years, these postal service packers get only 7-8000 salary
 agar aisa he to kya yah dukhad nahin he
 After 35 years of job, 7000 is not LA
 inkaa kahana he ki chaar saal paanch saal kaam karne ke baad haath main chah hazaar miltaa he, isse inkaa guzaaraa nahin chal rahaa he
 The government should also pay them the salary of the Seventh Pay Commission
 inhen pension tak nahin milti he
 The Kamlesh Chanda Committee was formed at the time of the Modi government, it also talked about increasing salary, but it is not being increased
 lihaaza desh ke alag-alag jagahon par gramin dak sevak hadtaal par hai
 i do not understand how he would have spent on salary of 5000
 shaayad yahi wo bharat he jo 99 pratishat aata he jiske paas kuch nahin he
 1 percent of Indians have as much property as 70 percent of Indians have
 tippaniyan It is not that the people do not struggle, they are doing but what is happening
 koi nateeja nikal rahaa he, shaayad nahin
 There have been many videos of Gramin Dak Sevaks
 in video main ek trend dekh rahaa hum
 a video of Surat's textile traders also came when they were agitating
 us video main ve geet ga rahe hai, anunay vinay kar rahe hai jaise koi apni premika se karata ho, un gaanon main aakrosh nahin he, zindaabad murdaabaad nahin he, usee tarah kaa ek video mila he, aap dekhie or samajhie ki gramin dak sevak kya kahana chaahate hai
 We spoke to the rural post servant of Muzaffpur
 unhone bataaya ki ve britash jamaane se gaanvon main dak le ja rahe hai
 Work under Postal Department but the Department does not consider them as their employees
 in logon ne apni ladaai supreme court or cat se jeet lee he magar abhi tak inhen karmchaaree ke rup main manyata nahin mili he
 Whereas they distribute cycles by cycling in every village
 is bich 16 dinon tak lagaataar petrol ke daam badhane ke baad aaj kamaal hi ho gaya
 1 paise became cheaper, while in the international market, the price of crude oil has come down by four and a half dollars
 1 paise kii kami ko kam na samajhen
 After the break we will see an important report on Mandsaur and cancer
 kya yah kam nahin he jabaki ve kaam kitna karte hai
 All government banks are going through a historical deficit
 unki haalat lagaataar bighad rahi he
 There are different reasons for this, but the effect of all this is that in 2017-19, the loss of banks is now starting to be several thousand crores
 ham kuch bainkon kaa ghaataa bataane ja rahe hai
 Losses of Punjab National Bank - 12, 282 crores, idbi's losses 8,237 crores, sbi's losses 6547 crores, Bank of India's losses 6043 crores, Oriental Bank of Commerce's losses 5871 crores, Union Bank of India's losses are 5247 crores
 ek sawaal khud se kiijie kya har bank main itane nithlle or nakaare banker baithe hai ki unheen kii vajah se kareeb 80,000 karod tak kaa ghaataa ho gaya yaa koi or jimmedaar hoga iske liye
 Such as government, management, industrialists
 aaj ke bijness standard main ek report he ki jo laghu vitt bank kaa enpie bhi 5-6 pratishat ho gaya he, jo notebandi ke pehle ke saal main 1 pratishat tha
 NPA means loan but could not repay
 bijness standard ne hi chapa he ki 2017-18 kii chauthi timahi main 37 bainkon ke enpie main 1 lakh 40 hazaar karod or jud gaye hai
 Is the common banker responsible for this as well
 dharna banane ke pehle tathyon ko thik se dekh lenaa chahie
 Therefore, bankers have included in their demand letter that often staff are forced to work late, their time is recorded
 maukhik aadesh se kaam band ho, kaam ke samay main badlaav kaa aadesh likhit aae
 No staff should be forced to work more than seven consecutive days
 aath ghante se zyada ve kaam na karen, saptaah main 40 ghante hi kaam karne ko kaha jaae
 All Saturdays are a holiday that is rarely met now
 zaahir he bankeron ko isse zyada karnaa padataa he
 Then these things have been mentioned in their demand letter
 ek maang yah bhi he ki dhamkaane or dabaav daalane ke liye tabadale kaa istamaal band kar diya janaa chahie
 Looking at the demand letter, it seems that the bankers want salary but there is a serious decline in working conditions
 isamen pension kii bhi maang he jiske bare main ab koi baat nahin karnaa chahta
 Legislative mps themselves take pension but make policies to ensure that others do not get pension
 aap is vakt screen par gramin dak sevakon ke alag-alag jagahon se bheji gai tasviren dekh rahe, pichley 17 dinon se bharat bhar ke gramin dak sevak hadtaal par hai
 These pictures are of the rural postal servants, who are surprised that their strike is not getting coverage even after having two lakh two hundred postal servants
 jab das lakh banker par koi charchaa nahin he to paune do lakh vaale ko bhi samajhnaa chahie ki media ke loktantr main asli log nahin aate hai
 These postal servants should also ask what they were seeing in newspapers and channels before the strike, what they were reading, whether they have seen the voice of the common people, except for the exception, how their voice would appear when not seen
 gramin daksevakon ne sab karke dekh liya
 Sold the vegetables, took off clothes, there were various problems, but his heart was broken
 unhen laga tha ki desh kii baaki samasyaon kii tarah unke halaat par bhi dibet hoga
 This is a picture of the post office of Faridabad
 hadtaal ke kaaran chitthiyaan padi hai
 How many important papers of people must not be reaching
 magar gramin dak sevakon kii sun to lijie taaki unhen ye na lage ki koi sunne vaahsaab se selary deni chahie

 chaara ghotaale ke tisare maamle main 5 saal kii sajaa or or 10 lakh rupye ke jurmaana hone ke baad lalu yadav or unki party kii museebataan or bad gai hai
 Without Lalu Yadav, the path ahead for the RJD will be extremely difficult, as there is no other person in his party like Lalu Yadav, who can campaign effectively for the party and win the election
 yah kahana he jediu ke varisht netaa kasee tyaagi kaa he
 After Lalu Yadav was decorated, he said that given the manner in which Lalu Yadav is being convicted in one case after another, it seems that Nitish Kumar decided to break his ties with him at the right time
 kasee tyaagi ne kaha ki agar hamane us samay lalu yadav kaa saath nahin choda hota to ab hamen yah faisla lenaa hota lekin samay rahete faisla lene kii vajah se hamaari party durgati hone se batch gai
 However, Kikeji Tyagi denied that his party would benefit from sympathy due to Lalu Yadav going to jail and being convicted in consecutive cases
 unhone kaha ki lalu yadav bhrashtachar or ghotaale ke silsile main jail ja rahe hai naa kii kisi raajnneetik andolan kii vajah se isliye unki party ko sahanubhuti milane kaa koi sawaal paidaa nahin hota
 The case in which Lalu Yadav was convicted on Wednesday belongs to the time when Lalu Yadav was the Chief Minister of Bihar and 30 crore rupees were extracted from Chaibasa through fake letters
 lalu yadav pehle se hi jail main hai or abhi 4 maamalon main faisla aana baaki he
 Casey Tyagi said that at this time the whole family of Laloo Yadav has been badly trapped in the affair of who has made a mess
 unhone kaha rashtriya janata dal ke yah bhi mushkil hogi ki ab chunaav ke samay gathbandhan karte vakt congress party dabaav banaakar unase zyada siton kii maang karegi
 Tyagi said that "despite political opposition i would say that Lalu Yadav has no answer in the campaign and he specializes in polarization of votes
" vaisaa netaa argedy main doosraa koi nahin he isliye unke bina argedy ke liye bahut mushkil hogi " 
 After the verdict, Lalu Yadav's son Tejashwi Yadav attributed the complicity of Nitish Kumar and BJP to Lalu Yadav's conviction
 is bare main puche jane par kasee tyaagi ne kaha kiisse pehle bhi lalu yadav ke bete par adaalat kii avmaananaa kaa maamla chalaa tha kyonki unhone jaj ke upar jatigat aarope lagaae the
 Even today his son's statement is not dignified
 unhone kaha ki adaalat raajnneetik partiyon ke hisaab se yaa jati ke hisaab se faisle nahin karti or adaalat ke faisle kaa sabko sammaan karnaa chahie
 The country is celebrating the birth anniversary of 'iron man' Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel today
 is maukey par deshbhar main centre sarkaar kii ore se 'ran for unity' kaa aayojan karavaaya ja rahaa he
 In Delhi, Prime Minister Narendra Modi flagged off 'run for Unity'
 saath hi apane sambodhan main kaha ki yuva peedi ko sardaar patel ke yogadan ko bhoolanaa nahin chahie
 Although Sardar Patel was the leader of the Congress, at that time his role was very important in getting freedom with Jawaharlal Nehru and Mahatma Gandhi
 lekin pichley kuch varshon main narendra modi ne patel ko lekar is tarah maahaul banaaya he ki maano vah bhartiya janata party ke netaa hi rahe hon
 Modi constantly says that great men do not belong to any party, they belong to the country
 modi kaa 'sardaar prem' desh ke saamne jab ujagar hua, jab unhone 2013 main sardaar sahab kii sabase oonchi murti 'stachu of unity' ke liye deshbhar ke kisaanon se loha maangana shuru kiya
 At that time Modi was the Chief Minister of Gujarat and was trying to present himself in national politics
 stachu of unity kaa kaam chal rahaa he or jald hi puraa bhi hone vaala he
 After this, when Modi became Prime Minister, he started Run for Unity
 or is din ko rashtriya ekta diwas ke rup main manaane kii shuruyaat kii
 Apart from this, Modi inaugurated the Sardar Sarovar Dam in Gujarat recently
 modi ne kaha ki is dam kaa sapana sardaar sahab ne hi dekha tha, jise aaj ham puraa kar rahe hai
 
 
 
 to nehru nahin sardaar patel hote desh ke pehle pmmoxi ne isko lekar lagaataar congress par nishaanaa saadhaa he
 Modi says that the Congress tried to forget Sardar Saheb's contribution
 modi kai maukon par kah chuke hai ki agar sardaar patel desh ke pehle pradhanmantri hote to shaayad desh kii tasviir alag hoti
 The way the Prime Minister Narendra Modi has created an atmosphere about Mahatma Gandhi and Sardar Patel in the past, the Congress has also targeted him
 piem modi ne lagaataar aarope lagaaya he kicongress party ne itihasase sardaar patel ke naam ko mitaane kii koshish kii
 The younger generation of the country was not told anything about them
 sardaar patel ne sam-daam-dand-bhed, kootneeti or ranneeti ke jariye desh ko ek sutara main baandha
 Sardar Patel was not introduced to the younger generation of our country, an attempt was made to erase the name of this great man from the window of history
 aakhir patel modi kii jarurat kyon?sardaar patel ko aakraamak netaa mana jaataa tha, unhone puure desh ko ek sutara main pirone kaa kaam kiya
 For this, he explained to the princely states, the Nawabs and taught strictly lessons to those who do not understand with love
 sardaar patel gujarat se aate hai, isliye modi gujarati asmita ko saath jodate hue apana naam lagaataar unke saath jodate hai
 PM Modi has pointed out on the Congress many times that if the Kashmir issue was also entrusted to Sardar Patel, then there would have been no dispute now
 kuch dinon main gujarat main chunaav bhi hai, ummid kii ja sakati he ki gujarati asmita kaa mudda abhi prachaar ke dauraan or bhi jor pakadega

 These reports caught fire again today when Madhya Pradesh CM Shivraj Singh Chauhan returned to Gujarat before Vijay Rupani was sworn in
 aise kayaas lagaae ja rahe hai ki shivaraj is badlaav ke paksh main nahin hai or shapath grahan samaaroh se pehle aisa kuch hua jisase naaraaz hokar shivaraj madhya pradesh laut aae
 Let me tell you, Shivraj Singh reached Gujarat on a state plane to join the eclipse Tuesday
 shivaraj kaarykram sthal bhi gaye or vahaan vijay roopaani se mulaakaat kar unhen guladasta bhent kiya, lekin wo shapath grahan tak nahin ruke or madhya pradesh laut gaye
 Chauhan reached Guna from Madhya Pradesh from Gujarat
 yahaan jab patrakaron ne unase shapath grahan main shaamil na hone par sawaal kiya to unhone kaha, 'mere 2 mahatvapurn kaarykram the
 One in Kolaras and the other in Mungavali, so i returned with permission from National President Amit Shah
 ' gauratlab he ki mungawali or kolaras vidhansabha main upachunaav hone hai
 Shivraj is working hard to win the by-election
 kyonki abhi haal hi main chitrakoot upachunaav main congress ne jeet darj kii thi
 At the same time, if the official program of Shivraj Singh Chauhan is seen, then it has been said to be involved in swearing
 chouhan ke kaarykram ke mutabik, unhen bhopal se subah 8 baje rajkeey vimaan seahmadabadke liye nikalnaa tha
 From where Chauhan would reach the venue in Gandhinagar by road
 yahaan ve shapath grahan kaarykram main shaamil hote or 12
 50 would have been taken out of Madhya Pradesh
 sab kuch shivaraj ke tay kaarykram ke tahat hi hua, bas wo shapath grahan tak nahin ruke or pehle hi madhya pradesh laut aae
 According to sources, Chauhan's return before the swearing-in shows that everything is not right
 isse pehle bhi wo kai baar apni reliyon main let pahunche hai
 Even today, there would not have been much impact
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki siem shivaraj singh chouhan madhya pradesh ke bhaajapa adhyaksh nand kumaar singh ko hataane kii charchaaon se naaraaz hai
 Actually, there have been allegations on Nand Kumar Singh that he remains more dedicated to Shivraj Singh than the organization
 saath hi madhya pradesh main wo sanghathan se zyada shivaraj singh ke samarpit logon ke liye kaam karte rahete hai
 It has also been alleged on several occasions that Nand Kumar is present everywhere as a spokesman for Shivraj
 is vajah se aisi charchaa he ki madhya pradesh main hone vaale chunaav se pehle unki kursi khatre main he
 The senior high command of the BJP is planning to remove him
 in khabaron kii vajah se shivaraj pareshaan hai
 However, Shivraj's departure from the program has raised many questions
 saath hi unki naaraazgi kii charchaaen bhi aam ho gai hai

 rakanpa ke varisht netaa prafull patel ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha, 'maharashtra kii janata ne kisi ek party ko janadesh nahin diya he
 No party is in a position to form a stable government on its own
 maharashtra ke logon ke hiton ko dhyaan main rakhte hue ham mahasoos karte hai ki hamen aisi party ko samarthan dena chahie jo sarkaar bana sakati ho
 Maharashtra needs a stable government
 ' Patel said, 'BJP has emerged as the largest party and we feel that we should support it from outside so that they can form government in the interest of stability and development in the state
 ' On 25 March, Kapil Sharma started his second innings on TV
 soni tivi par unhone nae sho 'family time vid kapil sharma' ke saath vaapasi kii
 But Comedy King's fans were disappointed with the show's first episode
 unhen kapil kii kamedi or sho kaa concept impressive nahin laga
 On social media, fans are trolling Kapil and taking out heartbreak
 twitor par dheron aise twit dekhne ko mil rahe hai jo kamedi king ke nae sho kii aalochana karte hai
 Many mimes, funny oneliners and photos are being posted
 kuch log sho ko boring to kuch flop bataa rahe hai
 Sunil Grover, who was seen selling vegetables, fans did trollship Kapil Sharma would not expect that the reaction of people will be seen
 siddhu, chandan prabhakar or kiku sharada kii tikdi bhi kapil ke sho ko bachaa nahin pai
 This time it would not be right to call Kapil's show a comedy show because this time it has appeared in the flavor of the game show
 lekin logon ko ye concept pasand nahin aayaa
 Some users requested him to return to the old format

 ) kanoon mantralay main kaamkaaj sanbhaalane ke pehle hi din kapil sibbal ne purv kanoonmantri ashvini kumaar ke vodaphone par kar dendaree ke maamle main unke faisle ko palat diya he
 In his decision, he has cleared the way for the government's agreement with the company
 isse pehle kumaar ne atorni general kii raay ke baad kar jamaa karne kaa rasta hi vikalp ke taur par bataaya tha, jabaki samjhaute kii baat ko kanoon mantralay or atorni general donon ne khaarij kar diya tha
 Please tell that the British company Vodafone is accused of evasion of tax of about 11 thousand crores in India and has to pay this tax
 is varsh ke aarambh main vittamantralay ke us prastaav ko kanoonmantri kumaar ne khaarij kar diya tha jisamen samjhaute ke raste ko apnaane kaa aagrah kiya gaya tha
 At that time the Law Ministry had declared it illegal
 kanoonmantralay ke alaava atorni general ne bhi samjhaute ke khilaaf apni salaah di thi or kaha ki vodaphone ko pehle apane dendaree chukaani chahie
 But, the special thing is that soon after Sibal took over, the Attorney General gave a fresh opinion that the agreement with Vodafone is legally rational
 kanoonmantralay ke hami ke baad ab yah maamla cabinet main jayega
 Asked about the change in opinion, Attorney General GE Vahanvati said that no attempt has been made to circumvent the law
 saath hi unhone kaha ki bina sansad kii manjuuri ke kuch bhi kiya nahin ja saktaa he
 The change in agi's opinion is said to have come at a meeting of Finance Minister p Chidambaram in the presence of Revenue Secretary and Chairman of Central Direct Taxes after the clarification in which Chidambaram said that the resolution of the agreement neither violated the law nor It makes any change in tax liability under the Income Tax Act
 chidambaram ne yah bhi kaha tha ki vodaphone ke saath muddon par vichaar karne ke liye cabinet se ijaajat ke liye prastaav rakhaa gaya tha
 Apart from this, the Finance Minister said that an agreement with Vodafone will be done within the scope of the law
 kanoonmantralay kaa kaamkaaj sanbhaalane ke saath hi sibbal ne is baat par jor diya tha ki kanoonee prakriya ko aarthik vruddhi main avarohak kaa kaam nahin karnaa chahie, balki use aage badhaane vaali honi chahie
 The comments bataa den ki britani company ne supreme court main isi kar maamle main cese jeeta tha or usee aadesh kaa asar samaapt karne ke liye kanoon main sanshodhan kiya gaya tha
 After this change, the Income Tax Department had sent a notice to Vodafone saying that the company had to pay tax interest of Rs 11,217 crore
 vahiin, iske jawaab main company ne kaha ki un par bharat sarkaar kii kuch bhi dendaree nahin banati he
 Earlier, Vodafone wanted to take the Indian government to the international court on this issue, but later on the path of compromise
 vodaphone par yah kar dendaree honkong kii company hachisan vampoa ko kharidne ke baad bani thi
 The purchase was made by the company in 2007
 bataa den ki britani company vodaphone par bharat main kareeb 11 hajaar karod rupee ke kar apvanchan kaa aarope he or is kar ko use chukaana he
 Earlier this year, the Finance Ministry's proposal was rejected by Law Minister Kumar, urging him to adopt the path of compromise
 us vakt kanoonmantralay ne ise gaiyr-kanoonee qaraar diya tha
 Apart from the Law Ministry, the Attorney General had also given his advice against the agreement and said that Vodafone should pay its dues first
 lekin, khaas baat yah he ki sibbal ke kaamkaaj sanbhaalane ke turant baad atorni general ne taaja raay dete hue kaha ki vodaphone se samjhauta kanoonee rup se tarksangat he
 After the approval of the Law Ministry, the matter will now go to the Cabinet
 apni raay main badlaav ke sawaal par atorni general jeei vaahnavati ne kaha ki kanoon ko darkinar karne kii koi koshish nahin kii gai he
 He also said that nothing can be done without the approval of Parliament
 kaha ja rahaa he ki agiai kii raay main parivartan vittamantri pi chidambaram kii ek baithak main rajasav sachiv or kendriya pratyaksh kar ke adhyaksh kii maujuudagi main us safai ke baad aayaa, jisamen chidambaram ne kaha ki samjhaute kaa prastaav na hi kanoon kaa ulanghan karata or na hi iskar kanoon ke tahat kar dendaree main koi badlaav karata he
 Chidambaram also said that there was a proposal for permission from the cabinet to consider issues with Vodafone
 iske alaava vittamantri ne kaha ki vodaphone ke saath kanoon ke daayre main rahakar hi samjhauta kiya jayega
 Along with the functioning of the Law Ministry, Sibal had emphasized that the legal process should not act as a hindrance to economic growth, but should be pursuing it
 tippaniyan Explain that the British company won the case in the same tax case in the Supreme Court and the law was amended to eliminate the effect of the same order
 is badlaav ke baad iskar vibhaag ne vodaphone ko notice bhejkar kaha tha ki company ko 11,217 karod rupee kaa kar may byaaj dena he
 At the same time, in response to this, the company said that the Government of India does not owe anything to them
 isse pehle vodaphone is mudde par bharat sarkaar ko antarrashtriya court main le janaa chaahati thi, lekin baad main samjhaute kii raah par chalane lagi
 This tax liability on Vodafone was created after the purchase of Hong Kong company Hutchison Wampoa

 There are two phases of voting scheduled for the Lok Sabha elections in the 40 parliamentary constituencies of Bihar in six phases, but the leaders of the ruling Janata Dal (united) have already come face to face
 aise main yah kayaas lagaaya jane laga he ki jediu ke liye kharaab din aane vaale hai
 The results of the Lok Sabha elections will be announced on May 16, but before that the JDU has started appearing in two camps
 dal ke rashtriya adhyaksh or madhepura se pratyaashee sharad yadav ne shuukravaar ko saarvajanik manch se rashtriya janata dal (argedy) ke adhyaksh lalu prasad yadav or bihar ke mukhyamantri or jediu ke 'senapati' maane jane vaale nitish kumaar par jaat-paat ke naam par raajnneeti karne kaa aarope laga diya
 Sharad Yadav has made this allegation when the voting in Madhepura has been completed
 vah khud madhya pradesh se bihar aakar yadav bahul kshetra madhepura se chunaav ladate rahe hai
 In an election meeting held in Muzaffarpur in support of JDU candidate Vijendra Chaudhary, Sharad openly said, "we first made Lalu the chief minister, then Nitish Kumar
" donon ne jati kii raajnneeti ko badhaava diya
 It is unfortunate that both believe in caste-based politics
 isse bihar ko nuksaan hua he
 Here, after this statement, the opposition got a chance to attack the sit-in JDU
 bijepi ke rashtriya pravaktaa shahanvaj hossain kehete hai, sharad ji puraane netaa hai or unka yah kahana swaagat yogya he
 BJP has always opposed doing politics in the name of caste
 bijepi ke bihar ikai ke adhyaksh mangal pandeya bhi kehete hai ki jediu ke rashtriya adhyaksh ke bayaan se yah saaf ho gaya he ki donon dalon kaa congress ke saath andruni talmail he
 They say that both leaders have ruined Bihar and the people will work to get Bihar out of this loss
 is bich, uttar pradesh kii varanasi seat par aam aadmi party (aap) ke ummidavaar arvind kejariwal ko samarthan dene ke sawaal par bhi jediu do dhadon main banta najar aayaa
 Bihar Pradesh JDU President Vashisht Narayan Singh said on Saturday clearly, no leader of Bihar JDU will go to Varanasi to campaign in favor of Kejriwal
 rashtriya mahasachiv kasee tyaagi ke bayaan kii ore dhyaan dilaane par unhone kaha, kejariwal ke samarthan ke vishay main diya gaya bayaan kaaphi jaldbaaji main liya gaya
 He said that there is now two-phase voting in Bihar and the battle here is more important than Kejriwal
 ullekhneey he ki party ke rashtriya pravaktaa tyaagi ne guuruuvaar ko nai dilli main narendra modi ko varanasi main haraane ke liye vahaan aap ke ummidavaar kejariwal ko samarthan dene kii baat kahi thi
 He had said that on 5 May, National President Sharad Yadav would go to campaign in favor of Kejriwal
 jediu ke ek varisht netaa kii maane, to sharad is maamle ko lekar pehle hi aitraaj jataa chuke hai
 Significantly, voting has been held in the parliamentary constituency of Sharad Yadav, former convenor of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA)
 sharad yadav ko madhepura se rashtriya janata dal (argedy) ke ummidavaar pappu yadav se kadi takkar mil rahi he
 At the same time, BJP candidate Vijay Singh Kushwaha's position is considered good due to the splitting of Yadav votes
 sutron kaa kahana he ki sharad jediu ke endie se baahar hone ke bhi khilaaf the, haalanki baad main party ke faisle ke saamne unhen jhukna padaa tha

 The Supreme Court and the Governor of Maharashtra may have rejected the plea of yakub Memon, the culprit of the Mumbai serial blasts, but Yakub still has one last chance to escape the execution
 darasal, 1993 main mumbai main hue bam dhamaakon ke doshi yaqub memon ne faansee kii sajaa se ek din pehle phir se raashtrapati ko dayaa yachika bheji he
 Yakub has stated that he is a patient of schizophrenia, so his mercy petition should be accepted
 2014 main yaqub ke bhai ne bhi dayaa yachika di thi, jise raashtrapati ne khaarij kar diya tha
 The Home Ministry is currently considering the mercy petition of Kayamak Memon on his old stand

 Yakub also sent a mercy petition to the President, on which a decision is yet to come
 raashtrapati ke nirnay ke baad yaqub kii faansee par muhar lag jaaegi
 The Supreme Court rejected the petition
 Meanwhile, the Supreme Court has rejected Yakub's application to postpone the execution on 30 July
 agar raashtrapati bhi yaqub kii dayaa yachika khaarij kar dete hai, to use 30 july ko subah 7 baje faansee de di jaaegi
 The rationale of not following the rules is that the petition has said not to follow the rules in issuing death warrants for hanging

 It is being tried to use this as an argument to avoid hanging

 The curative petition was delivered by Yakub, which was rejected by the court on 21 July 2015

 This left-arm spinner showed that he also enjoys taking wickets of top batsmen
 or isse inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa he ki australia kii haalat patali karne main jadeja ne bhi acha-khaasaa yogadan diya
 Jadeja could have got more wickets, but on two occasions, Pant left a catch on his balls behind the wicket

 So Jadeja overtook him, leaving behind some more left-handed bowlers including Mitchell Johnson
 darasal aapako bataa den ki jadeja ne irapalli prasanna ke 189 wicket chatakaane kii barabari kar lee he
 But the difference is that while Prasanna took 189 wickets in 49 Tests, Jadeja did this task in just 40 Tests
 matlab jadeja ne prasanna ko ek tarah se nau test ke antar se peeche chhod diya
 Along with this feat, after 40 Tests, Jadeja left the rest of the world left-arm bowlers far behind the number of wickets
 jaliye jaan lijie ki chalis test maichon ke baad kis banyahattha gendbaaj ke kitne wicket rahe
 Hopefully, Jadeja's adventures will not end here
 or jaise-jaise jadeja aage or match khelenge, vah gend ke saath or bhi kai record apni jholii main daalenge

 hameshaa se maine yahi siikhaa or mana he ki nai peedi jab aage aati he to kuch badlaav khud-ba-khud mahasoos hone lagate hai
 This is applicable in any area from home
 sangeet kii duniya ke liye yah kudarti kanoon bhala alag kaise ho saktaa he
 Especially when i look at the world of film music, i feel the biggest difference
 hamaare vakt main gayakon ko kuch khone kaa dar nahin rahata tha or sangeetkaaron kaa ham bhagwaan kii tarah sammaan karte the
 In this new generation of singers, there is a fear that someone else may find their song
 saath main yah bhi kahana chaahuungi ki yahi dar unako aage badhane kaa rasta bhi detaa he kyonki apana gaanaa pakkaa karne ke liye ve bahut zyada mehnat karte hai
 Not that there was any lack of hard work among the earlier singers
 par hamaari peedi ne jis tarah se apane gaanon ko anjvaay kiya, uski kami is peedi main jarur mahasoos hoti he
 However, he was not less than anyone in talent
 nae gayakon main mohit chouhan or javed ali se main bahut prabhavit hum
 Both have a great voice and both sing all kinds of songs very well
 unki aawaaj main variety he
 Mohit's voice adds more fun songs
 javed imotional geeton ko dil se gaate hai or samaa baandh dete hai
 Shweta Pandit and Shivani sing very well in the new singers
 lekin shreya ghoshaal or sunidhi chouhan ko agar main bahut senior na maanu to kahana changi ki ab bhi unki barabari karne vaala koi nahin he
 Shreya and Sunidhi have stood up to the likes of the new era in every way
 mujhe to isamen andeh nahin he ki ve abhi bahut lambey samay tak apni gayikee ko kaayam rakhengi
 Yes, one thing in particular for Kailash Kher will be that his Sufi singing is amazing
 lekin meri apni nijee raay he ki unhen sangeetkaar banane kii jaldbaaji nahin kerani chahie
 They should pay more attention to singing, so that they get the best songs
 kher ke sangharsh or unki kaabiliyat ko main mahasoos kar sakati hum
 It will be a big deal for me to say something to Rahat Ali Sahab
 main raajnneeti nahin karti
 But his songs are nothing short of a gift to the world of music
 main us daur ko yaad karti hum, jab hamaare sangeet main bijness sab kuch nahin hota tha
 How often it used to happen that our name was recommended by the singer who was called to sing
 sangeetkaar hamen yah fakhr se bataate the or aisa lagbhag sabhi karte the
 Sometimes i felt that this song Kavita ji (krishnamurthy) could sing better, so i put her name forward, sometimes she or some other singer put forward my name
 is nai peedi main aisi baaten ab sunne ko nahin milteen
 Everything is becoming professional
 isamen bazaar, keemat or kamyaabi ko dhyaan main rakhaa jaataa he
 But the world of notes is ahead of these things and will remain
 nai peedi spardhaa ke mahatv ko samajhe, yah bhi yaad rakhe ki mukaable se zyada sangeet ko tavajjo di jaae
 i hope this happens

 The differences in the ruling JDU in Bihar on the issue of Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha have come to the fore
 party ne kuch maheenon pehle tak pravaktaa rahe shivanand tiwari ko kaarykaal puraa hone ke baad dobaaraa rajyasabha nahin bhejne kaa faisla kiya
 Then Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar said clearly that whether Tiwari, Sabir Ali, he will have to contest the Lok Sabha elections and will have to give his decision on this within two days
 ab shivanand ne nitish kumaar par palatwaar karte hue kaha ki main loksabhaa kaa chunaav nahin laduunga
 Explaining the reason for this, Tiwari said that Nitish Kumar wants me to lose the election
 gauratlab he ki party ne unhen baxur se loksabhaa chunaav ladane kaa faisla kiya tha
 On writing Nitish to the state president, Tohmatashivanand Tiwari has written a letter to the state president of the party Vasishtha Narayan Singh saying that the man (nitish Kumar) dislikes me to the extent of hatred
 jo mujhe kaatane ke liye do nirdosho kaa nishthurtaapurvak vadh kar saktaa he, uski taraf se main chunaav ladane kii morrkhtaa kaise kar saktaa hum
 Sabir Ali was ready to contest the election that along with Shivanand Tiwari, Nitish Kumar also cut NK Singh and Sabir Ali from the Rajya Sabha
 inamen se sirf sabir ali hi loksabhaa chunaav ladgaye ko taiyaar hai
 The party wants NK Singh to contest from Banka and Sabir Ali from Shivhar
 dilli chunaav main ali kaa dohan kar chhod diyanithish kumaar par apana hamalaa tej karte hue shivanand ne un par party ke muslim chehre sabir ali kaa istemaal kar phenk dene kaa aarope lagaaya
 Tiwari has written in his letter that the extent happened in the case of Sabir Ali
 dilli ke chunaav main uskaa dohan hua or jab nitish kumaar dilli gaye the tab unhone sabake saamne kaha tha ki sabir ali dobaaraa rajyasabha jaaenge
 He has further written that he can behave in such a manner in which there will be some human pride
 nitish ne koun se tevar or manch apanaayeshivanand tiwari ne aage patr main likhaa he ki mai acchhee tarah jaanata hum ki nitish jitaane ke liye nahin mujhe haraane ke liye chunaav ladne ko kah rahe hai
 At the same time when we came out of the NDA, i told Nitish that i wanted to contest the election
 aap ladiye, yah kehane main us samay kya dikkat thi
 Why was the platform of Srikrishna Memorial chosen to declare his decision to contest elections
 mukhyamantri par tanj kasate hue tiwari likhte hai ki faisla sunaane kaa jo andaaj or tevar tha vah chunaav jitaane vaala tha yaa haraane vaala
 Lalu was also written to Shivanand Tiwari, who gave the message of not criticizing Modi on the Khataparti Forum, is a great writer in writing letters
 jab unhone argedy mukhiya lalu prasad yadav kaa saath choda tha, tab bhi khub patr likhaa tha
 Now that the JDU has not given the ticket, its exercise is considered to be carried out

 At the same time, Shivraj told the people from the stage that he has been working for the people of the state continuously for 11 years
 din raat ghoomane ke kaaran siem banane ke baad unke gaal or cheharaa pichak gaya he
 During this, he said that the cheeks of the Chief Minister who had been the chief minister before him in the state used to become 'red-pink' and become thick
 shivaraj kaa ishaara kis taraf?apane bhaashan ke dauraan shivaraj ne kaha ki aap logon ne kaise kaise mukhyamantri dekhe honge, jinke gaal laal ho jate the, mote ho jate the, magar khud wo ek aise mukhyamantri hai, jinke gaal or cheharaa pichak gaya he
 Now the question arises as to which direction Shivraj was referring to
 kyonki unki apni hi party ke kai mukhyamantri hai jo shaareerik rup se mote hai
 Although Shivraj did not name anyone during his speech, people laughed a lot at the cm's statement
 vahiin kuch logon ne shivaraj ke bayaan ko padosi rajyon ke mukhyamantriyon se jod diya

 The only thing was that in the end, seeing the stage empty, he took one or two photos and put it on Facebook saying that he has given the lecture
 yahaan tak to sab thik chal rahaa tha par harvard vaale itane thalue baithe the ki mail bhej-bhej bataane lage lalu putree yahaan sirf sunne ai thim na ki sunaane

 is ghatana se bina driver ke metro ko trek par utaarne kii yojana ko bada jhatka mana ja rahaa he
 In the statement issued by the Delhi Metro after pictures of the two colliding with the media surfaced, it said that this was not a major incident and the incident happened due to the negligence of the staff of Rotem, the commissioning company

 While starting the trial run, DMRC MD Mangu Singh had said that he would have to mentally prepare the passengers of the metro to travel in a driverless train and this could be done only by trusting the technology of the metro, but after this incident The trust of DMRC engineers themselves has been badly shaken
 aise main philhal driverles train chalaane kii yojana khatai main pad sakati he
 Although DMRC says that she was earlier going to run these trains along with the driver for a couple of years, despite that this train can be run without an automatic system even without a driver
 philhal dmarsi ne driverles train haadase ke liye aantarik jaanch shuru kar di he or saath hi kaha he ki commercial oparation main chalane vaali train atipi yani automatic train protection or ateo yani automatic train aaparishan ke zarie chalaai jaati he, jisamen do trainon ke ek hi treks par hone kii koi sambhaavna nahin rahati or saath hi do trainon ke bich ek nishchit antar bana rahata he
 In the board meeting to be held on Monday, the circumstances after this accident can be discussed and after that the scope of investigation can also be extended

 Constitutional expert Fali Nariman, one of the country's top jurists, has opposed the National Judicial Appointments Commission Bill
 hedlins today se khaas baatcheet main unhone kaha ki bill kaa maujuuda swaroop unhen sweekaar nahin he or ise vah supreme court main chunauti denge
