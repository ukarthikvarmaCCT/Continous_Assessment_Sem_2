 There is a traveller's story but it does not tell about the platform

 Revenue Secretary Hasmukh Adhia has said that the government is not manipulating the tax exemption received by political parties
 raajnneetik dal 500 or 1,000 rupee ke note apane khaaton main jamaa karaane ke liye mukt hai, lekin is prakaar kii jamaa par shart hogi ki isamen nakad main liya gaya vyaktigat chanda 20,000 rupee se adhik nahin hona chahie or iske puure dastavej hone chahie, jisamen daandaata kii puri pahchaan honi chahie
 He said that if any one person donates more than Rs 20,000 to the party, under the existing law, it should be done through check or bank draft
 sarkaar ne yah bhi kaha he kisaanon kii krishi aay kar mukt he, haalanki, is maamle main kisaanon ko ek ghoshnaa patr dena hoga jisamen yah kahana hoga ki unki salanaa aay 2
 5 lakhs is less than Rs
 aisi ghoshnaa se unhen bank jamaa ke liye pan kii aavashyaktaa nahin hogi
 Adhia said that farmers who are unable to submit declaration forms will have to provide a permanent account number ie PAN
 unhone kaha ki raajnneetik dalon kii bank jamaa raashi par tex nahin lagaaya jayega
 He said, 'if this amount is deposited in the account of a political party, then it is exempt, but if this amount is lying in a personal account, information about it will come in our radar
 yadi koi vyakti apane khate main paisa rakh rahaa he to iske bare main hamen soochna mil jaaegi

 ) unhone kaha ki yadi koi ek vyakti 20,000 rupee se adhik kaa daan party ko detaa he to maujuuda kanoon ke tahat yah check yaa bank draft ke jariye hona chahie
 The government has also said that the agricultural income of the farmers is tax free, however, in this case the farmers will have to give a declaration stating that their annual income is 2
 5 lakh rupee se kam he
 Such an announcement would not require them to have PAN for bank deposits
 adhiya ne kaha ki jo kisaan ghoshnaa patr jamaa nahin kar paaege, unhen sthaayee khaataa sankhya yani pan dena hoga
 He said that bank deposits of political parties will not be taxed
 unhone kaha, 'yadi yah raashi raajnneetik dal ke khate main jamaa he to us par chhot he, lekin yadi yah raashi kisi vyaktigat khate main padi he to uske bare main soochna hamaare radar main aa jaaegi

 officiala post shared byvivek Oberoi (@vivekoberoi) onapr 5, 2019 at 7:15 am PDT Significantly, Vivek Oberoi's film 'PM Modi' is in controversy for several reasons
 film ke content ko lekar vivaad to he hi, is film kii release date bhi kaaphi khinchataan ke baad final ho pai he
 First the film was to be released on 12 April, then its date was 5 April but finally the film is going to release on 11 April

 The sword of the CBI continues to hang on Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh
 maamla ab sabase badi adaalat kii choukhat par he
 The matter is scheduled to be heard on Monday, in such a situation, the Congress, standing with Virbhadra Singh, has also prepared Plan B
 darasal abhi tak congress or khud virbhadra singh sibiai ke ection ko centre sarkaar kii badale kii bhaavana se prerit bataa rahe the
 But the matter of disproportionate assets is now heard in the Supreme Court on Monday, in such a situation, the Congress high command is afraid that, if the court has made a sharp comment and does not give relief to Virbhadra, then the pressure of morality will increase considerably
 aise main virbhadra singh ke saath khadey alaakaman ne plan bi bhi banaaya he
 Under Plan B, if the CM has to change under any circumstances, there are two names
 pehla naam he punjab kii prabharee aashaa kumari, jinke sir punjab kii safalataa kaa taj bhi he or wo paanch baar kii vidhayak hai
 Also, another name is that of senior leader Kaul Singh Thakur
 lekin philhal res main sabase aage aashaa kumari hi hai
 On the other hand, realizing the seriousness of the matter, Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh has suggested to the high command that, elections are scheduled in November 2017, April is going on, in such a situation, they should go to the public by holding early elections and seek justice in the people's court
 darasal, virbhadra singh ko lagata he ki, ek baar chunaav kii ghoshnaa ho gayi, to wo janata ke bich khud ko bijepi kii saazish kaa shikaar bataakar siyaasi phayda le paaenge
 In such a situation, now a lot will be decided on a court hearing, but the next few days can prove to be important for Virbhadra Singh, who is going to be 83 years old in June
 philhal is maamle par congress kaa koi netaa is plan bi ke bare main bolne ko taiyaar nahin he
 After all, it is the case of Veerabhadra Singh and the party wants to stand with Virbhadra till the end and also realize that Virbhadra Singh, so that if the party is forced to make any decision, then Veerabhadra should accept that decision, not rebellion

 In contrast to its earlier stance, the government has decided to explore the possibility of taking the case to international courts and seeking permission from the Supreme Court in this regard
 pehle sarkaar ne is mudde pacentararashtriya court main apil karne se inkaar kar diya tha
 But the issue remained a topic of discussion in political circles and social media throughout the day after the news of our affiliate newspaper 'mail Today'
 baikfoot par ai centre sarkaar kii ore se khud videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ko is par bayaan dene aana padaa
 He told the media that the central government will take permission from the Supreme Court in this regard and if the apex court gives its permission then the issue will be raised in the international court

 pakistan ne inke upar khub atyaachaar kiya or in par hue amanviya saluk ke kaaran kuch samay baad inaki maut ho gai thi
 When his body was sent to India by Pakistan, the family and the country was shocked to see the condition of the dead body
 tab se lekar aaj tak parivaar pakistani sainikon ke khilaaf karrwai kii maang kar rahaa he
 The government was not going to go to the international court earlier, when the issue was raised in Parliament recently whether the murder case will be placed before the International Court of Justice (ICJ), so that Pakistani soldiers can be punished? In response, the government said, 'this matter has been conveyed during the New York session on 22 September 1999 and the Human Rights Commission in April 2000 itself
 antarrashtriya court ke jariye kanoonee karrwai ke bare main bhi saare pahaluon par vichaar kiya gaya, lekin yah sambhav nahin lagata
 'about a year ago, a video on youtube also went viral, in which a Pakistani soldier admits that a 32-year-old army officer was severely tortured and held hostage during the Kargil war

 bihar main mahagathbandhan kii sarkaar mushkil main he
 Hardly because the constituents of the Grand Alliance have split in two parts regarding the presidential election
 ek taraf bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar kii party janata dal you bihar ke rajyapal rahe ramnath kovind kaa samarthan kar rahi he, to duusari taraf congress ne apana ummidavaar mira kumaar ko banaaya he, jiskaa samarthan argedy kar rahi he
 In the grand alliance, leaders of Janata Dal u and RJD are targeting each other
 par congress is sabase dur he
 He is silent
 congress ko ek taraf ummid he ki nitish kumaar apane faisle par punarvichaar karenge, to duusari taraf khamoshi bataa rahi he ki raashtrapati chunaav ke faisle ke baad congress bihar main bada kadam uthaane par bhi vichaar kar sakati he
 According to sources, this decision could also be a withdrawal of support from the Grand Alliance government
 halaki nitish kumaar ke ravaiye par somvaar ko congress ke varisht netaa gulam nabi aaazaad ne unhen khub khari-khoti sunai, lekin iskaa koi asar janata dal you par nahi dikhaa
 Bihar Chief Minister and National President of Janata Dal u Nitish Kumar has already explained why his party is supporting NDA candidate Ramnath Kovind and the opposition is fielding him to defeat Bihar's daughter Meera Kumar
 agar aisa hi tha to jab congress ke paas bahumat tha tab usne kyon nahimira kumaar komaidan main utaara
 The party will continue to maintain the same even today
 janata dal you ke pravaktaa ajay alok kaa kahana he ki raashtrapati kisi dal yaa jamaat kaa nahi hota
 We still stand on our decision
 bihar congress se mil rahi andruni khabaron ke mutabik congress ke kai vidhayak endie ke paksh main matdaan kar sakate hai
 The claim is also being made from the other side that the Janata Dal will come in support of U
 MLA Meera Kumar
 lekin abhi is par kuch bhi kahana he jaldibaji hi hogi
 But it is certain that according to statistics, the victory of NDA candidate Ramnath Kovind is certain
 janata dal you or argedy ke bich nokzok main thodi kami ai he
 The RJD supremo summoned MLA Bhai Virendra, who commented on Nitish Kumar, and tried to rein in his statement, then acted on the spokesperson and removed him
 jediu philhal to santusht he lekin ise viraam nahi manaa ja saktaa he
 However, even though the leaders of the grand alliance are saying that everything is alright, the fire is burning inside
 congress bhi isliye chup he ki raashtrapati chunaav main haar ke baad wo kisi na kisi par thikra phodega hi, aise main mahagathbandhan se uchit avasar or kahaan milegaa
 However, behind all this, the statement of senior Congress leader CP Joshi is being accepted in which he said that the Grand Alliance only exists in Bihar and not outside Bihar
 aise main janata dal you kaa maananaa he kiraashtrapati kaa chunaavdesh kaa chunaav he, bihar kaa nahin

 ek intervyuu main saf ne nepotism ke vishay par 'anuvanshiki' or 'yujanix' kii baat kii thi, jis par unhen aalochana kaa shikaar hona padaa tha
 Seeing the escalation of the controversy, Saif has written an open letter accusing the media of fueling the case
 saf ne kaha ki mujhe maaf karen ki aapane 'yujanix' shabd kaa galat matlab nikaala
 i think people should remove their minds from the clothes of actresses and focus on improving their language
 saf ne dikhaaya badppan, maangi kangana se mafisaf ne diene main prakashit open letters main likhaa, ifa ke dauraan nepotism par kii gai baaten majaak thim
 There was no need to increase this much
 maine kangana se persenalee maafee maang lee thi
 So that thing should have ended there
 ab saf ke open letters kaa jawaab dete hue kangana ne bhi ek open letters likhaa he
 In this open letter published in Mid Day, Kangana wrote- Saif, you wrote in your letter that 'I have apologized to Kangana and now i do not need to give any explanation to anyone
 yah mudda ab khatm ho chukaa he
 'but this issue is not mine alone
 kangana par laga nepotism kaa aarope, twitor par bhadakin bahan rangoliparivaarwaad kai staron par nishpakshthawaad or tark ko samaj nahin paata
 i have learned my life values from people who have been very successful in their lives

 is aword function ko karan johar or saf host kar rahe the or tabhi ek maukey par jab varun dhawan stage par best actor comic role kaa aword lene ki liye pahunche tabhi saf ali khan ne kaha nepotism yani bhai bhatija kii baat chhedate hue kaha, 'aaj tum jo bhi ho sirf apane pita kii vajah se ho'
 Varun Dhawan responded to Saif and whatever you are is because of his mother Sharmila Tagore
 'baat yaheen nahin thami, phir karan johar ne kaha, 'main is industry main apane pita kii badaulat hum' or phir teenon ne jor se kaha 'nepotism rox'
 Saif and Varun sang a song from Karan Johar's film Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham and said, "bole Banguri Bole Kangna", on which Karan Johar said to Tapak "kangna is neither spoken nor good
" ' lekin ab saf ali khan ne maafee maang lee he or varun dhawan ne twit ke jariye maafee maangi

 26 janvari ko deshbhar main 69waan ganatantr diwas manaaya jayega
 The Constitution of our country was implemented on this day
 lekin aapako jaanakar hairaani hogi ki 26 janvari ko manaae jane vaale ganatantr diwas ko 'swatantraaa diwas' ke rup main manaaya jaataa tha
 Let's know what the whole story is
 
 
 bharat ko aazaadee bhale hi 15 agast 1947 ko mili lekin 26 janvari 1950 ko bharat purna ganraajya bana
 On this day, the whole of India celebrates as Republic Day
 samvidhan 26 november 1949 main puri tarah taiyaar ho chukaa tha lekin do maheene intjaar karne ke baad ise 26 janvari 1950 ko lagu kiya tha
 The date of January 26 was chosen to implement the constitution because on January 26 in 1930, the Indian National Congress under the leadership of Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of the country, declared 'purna Swaraj' against the British rule
 bharat ke ganatantr kii yatra kai saalon puraani he, jo 1930 main shuru hui thi
 After which, from 1930 to 15 August 1947, Swatantra Day was celebrated on Purna Swaraj Day i
e
 26 January
 jab ganatantric raashtra kaa hua elaanganatantr raashtra ke bare main 31 disambar 1929 ko raat main bhartiya rashtriya congress ke lahore satr main vichaar kiya gaya tha
 For which a meeting was held
 yah baithak pandit jawaharlal nehru kii adhyakshata main yojit kii gai thi
 Those who attended the same meeting had earlier pledged to celebrate January 26 as "independence Day", so that the dream of complete independence from the British Raj could be realized
 iske baad lahore satr main naagarik avagya andolan kii ruparekha taiyaar hui or yah faisla liya gaya ki 26 janvari 1930 ko 'purna swaraj diwas' ke rup main manaaya jayega
 On the same day, the country's flag was hoisted and on 26 January, an oath was taken to celebrate Independence Day
 iske liye sabhi krantikariyon or partiyon ne ekajutata dikhaai thi
 Dr
 rajendra prasad ne kii 26 janvari ko ganatantr diwas manaane kii ghoshnajaha bharat desh angrejon kii gulaami se 15 agast 1947 ko aaazaad ho gaya tha
 But when the Indian Constitution came into existence on 26 January 1950, India realized its power
 desh kaa samvidhan 2 saal, 11 maheene or 17 din main taiyaar kiya gaya tha
 It would not be wrong to say that India got independence in the true sense only on 26 January
 jiske baad desh ke pehle raashtrapati dow
 Rajendra Prasad announced to celebrate Republic Day nationwide on 26 January
 rajya main ekmaatr charan main nau november ko matdaan hoga or matganana 18 disambar ko hogi

 Justice Markandey Katju had the habit of spewing such truths from the Bhagavad Gita in the midst of the daily engagements of the Supreme Court - "infinite, unbroken, untouched, impenetrable"
 aise vachan bolkar ve kuch pal thaharte, goyaa unke bheetar kuch aakaar le rahaa ho
 Everyone within the court stared at them in the hope of understanding their words

 His written blog, 'how a corrupt judge continued in the Madras High Court' has become quite popular
 nyaaypalika ke maanakon, javabdehi or niyuktiyon se judaa karypalika kaa 28 saal purana agenda ab shaayad apekshit anjaam tak pahunch paaegaa
 The good news for the government is that it does not like outspoken judges who can make their place in the hearts of the people by speaking out against scams
 justise katju ke 20 july ko kiye gaye rahasyodghatan ke baad aisa lagata he ki ek nayaa or dilachasp adhyay khul chukaa he
 Justice Katju, a 68-year-old scholar who is the bearer of the dynastic legacy of the judiciary, has been campaigning continuously on television since then
 unhone bharat ke teen purv mukhya nyaayadhishon par upie sarkaar ke saath milakar ek bhrasht atirikt jaj es
 Accused of restoring Ashok Kumar
 iske peeche unhone upie ke ek gathbandhan sahyogi diemke kaa haath bataaya he, jiske ek netaa ko ukt jaj ne jamaanat di thi
 This happened when the judge was made the Chief Justice of the Madras High Court in 2004
 2005 main katju dilli ucch nyaayalay chale aae or 2006 main supreme court ke jaj ban gaye
 Why does Justice Katju get so angry? Probably no one knows, but during his tenure between April 2006 and September 2011, there was no more than one living room and no more than his court number six in the Supreme Court premises
 aktubar, 2011 main unhen press parishad kaa adhyaksh banaaya gaya tha
 Since then, during the last three years, it seems that he has accepted the entire country as his court
 bharatiyon ke ikyuu str se lekar salmaan rushdi ke gadhy or pakistan par mamata banerjee kii tippanee tak takreeban har maamle par apni thos raay vyakt karne ke alaava tulsidas, shakespeare or gaalib ko uddhrut karne kii hazirajvaabi ne unhen is desh kii sabase pasandida jigyaasa main badal daalaa he
 In the first post of his blog 'satyam Bruyat', he wrote on December 31, 2012, "I find many people arrogant, cynical, chaotic, propaganda lovers, rude, blunt and even such a dog (by a Chief Minister) Is also said, which comments on 'every thing'
 ”jigyaasa main aadmi sawaal bhi karata he
 There are many questions on Justice Katju in this case
 pehla sawaal to yahi he ki nau saal tak bhrashtachar ko saamne laane main katju kyon asamarth rahe (jabaki doshi jaj jinda tha)? ek sanvaidhanik pad par baithe kisi shaks ke liye yah pardaafash karnaa kya badhyakaari kartavya nahin tha? is maamle main unki sanlagnta kis had tak thi?yah sawaal isliye kyonki samvidhan ke anuchhed 217(1) ke anusaar hycourt ke jajon kii niyukti raashtrapati dwaara bharat ke mukhya nyaayadhish, rajyapal or hycourt ke mukhya nyaayadhish kii raishumaari se kii jaati he
 It would be difficult for many to understand that Justice Katju, grandson of Jawaharlal Nehru's close aide Kailashnath Katju, could go so against the Congress-led government
 salbhar pehle hi farvari, 2013 main bijepi ke sheersh netaa arun jetali ne katju se press parishad kii adhyakshata chhodie ko kaha tha, jab unhone gaiyr-congressi sarkaron ko aade haathon liya tha (iske alaava katju ne yah tippanee bhi kii thi ki ''main nahin maanata ki shri modi kii 2002 ke dangon main koi bhoomika nahin thi
 ) According to Jaitley, such statements were "like a thank you note to those who gave Katju a job after his retirement
 ” justise katju akele nahin hai, jinhen upie sarkaar ne sevanivritti ke baad kaam diya
 Dozens of such retired judges are sitting in commissions and tribunals
 baharhaal, desh main lokapal kaa pad abhi bharaa janaa baaki he or dilli main ise lekar roj nai-nai atakalein lag rahi hai
 Maybe something more interesting will be seen in the coming days

 After spending more than five thousand crores on advertisement of the government's work in five years and continuing rallies continuously, the Prime Minister wants to do 100 rallies from the government expenditure
 aachaar samhita se pehle unhone 100 reliyaan karne kii thaanee he
 In this context, preparations for their rally in 100 districts will be going on
 ek raily par kitna sarkari karch aata he is lihaaz se unke kaarykaal main hui sabhi reliyon kaa hisaab mil jaataa to ham jaan pate ki pradhanmantri ne sirf reliyaan karne main kai hazaar karod phoonk daale hai
 It is the right of the Prime Minister to rally
 lekin ve ise kaam samaj kar karne lage hai
 The list of things to be counted initially from their foundation stone to inauguration could be done by their ministers and mps
 lekin jab pradhanmantri mandir ke navinikaran ke kaam kaa shubharambh karne odisha chale ja rahe hai to swadesh darshan yojana kii pattica lagane kerala chale jaaen to phir in reliyon kii praasangikta par sawaal uthanaa chahie
 These are all government rallies
 isliye tarah tarah kii yojanaayen shaamil kii ja rahi hai taaki janata ko lage ki pradhanmantri kaam se uske shahar aa rahe hai
 If you read the press releases of Prime Minister Modi's programs in the last one month, you will know that the Prime Minister is inaugurating the post office to the bypass at this time
 patr soochna karyaalay PIB ne website par sari vijyaptiyaan prakashit kii hai
 Of course there are big plans in many places, but there are many that have been mentioned recently
 agra kii raily main gangaajal kii yojana kaa shilanyas to samaj aata he lekin puure agra shahar main sisitivi lagaae jane kii yojana kii aadharshila pradhanmantri rakhenge yah samaj nahin aata he
 This work should have come from the local MP
 bhaashan main pradhanmantri kehete hai ki sisitivi lagane se agra ko vishwastareey smart city banane main madad milegi! sachhee! sisitivi se koi shahar smart city ho saktaa he to har khilone or kapade kii dukaan ko smart shop ghoshit kar dena chahie kyonki vahaan sisitivi laga he
 The ATM should be declared a smart ATM because there is CCTV installed! The foundation stone and the list of inauguration are being extended so that it can be covered by the government program
 magar baarik detail dekhne se lagata he ki prashasan kisi tarah unki raily ko sarkari banane ke liye yojanaayen juta rahaa he
 Because at this time these rallies are being organized only through government expenditure
 pradhanmantri 20 rajyon kii 122 sansadeey siton par 100 reliyaan karenge
 According to one news, we will finish 50 rallies by February
 aisa lagata he ki kisi doctor ne dawa kii tarah reliyon kii sankhya likh kar de diya he
 Have a rally in the morning and a rally in the evening, you will feel better
 lagegaa ki aapke paas kaam he
 People will also feel that you have work
 isiilie pradhanmantri kabhi agra hote hai to kabhi bolangir to kabhi silvasa to kabhi kollam
 After the code of conduct, he will have no less than 100 rallies
 haal ke vidhansabha chunaavon main bhi pachis tees reliyaan ho chuki hongi
 He seems to have left the Prime Minister's Office
 unke liye piemo bas adde ke samaan rah gaya he
 They come to PMO to change bus or change clothes from one rally to another
 vahaan pahunch kar kisi videshi mehmaan se milakar agali raily ke liye nikal jate hai
 It would have taken at least five hours for the Prime Minister to hold a rally
 aana-janaa, bhaashan kii taiyaari karnaa bahut baaten hoti hai
 You should calculate this average yourself
 100 reliyaan karne main 500 ghante lagenge
 That is twenty days
 to hisaab kahata he ki nae saal ke pehle teen chaar maheene ke bees din ve koi kaam nahin karenge
 Government employee's leave is also 28 days
 phir bhi ye baat pradhanmantri hi kah sakate hai ki ve din-raat kaam karte hai
 More than four million employees, around seventy ministers, many secretaries, joint secretaries, yet the Prime Minister works day and night
 sawaal he ki baaki log phir kya karte hai ki ve pradhanmantri ko godaam or checkpost ke udghaatan ke liye bhej dete hai? kya pradhanmantri ke paas itnaa samay he? yaa unhone yahi samaj liya he ki kaam kaa matlab bhaashan hota he

 com / 55p5lruc14 deepika, ranvir singh or shahid kapur starer padmavat ke aadhikarik taur par 25 janvari ko relies hone kii ghoshnaa ho chuki he
 Akshay Kumar's Padman is also being released on this date
 donon badi filmon ke box offis klesh se inke bijness par asar dekhne ko milegaa
 Producer of the film Padman and Akshay's wife Twinkle Khanna have described this clash as harmful for both films
 tvinkal khanna ne kaha ki box offis par yah klesh donon kii partiyon ke liye acha nahin he
 This clash will have an impact on both films
 lekin yah baat bhi sach he ki padmavat ke mekars ko relies date ke liye kaaphi sangharsh karnaa padaa he
 But i wished that Bhansali's film was released a week before Padman or a week later
 25 janvari ko hi 3 bhashaaon main relies hogi 'padmavat', akele nahin dekh paaenge baccheectress ne kaha, mujhe yakeen he ki padmavat ek adbhut film hogi
 But we also trust the content of our film
 isiilie ham apni relies date ke saath chhedchhad nahin karnaa chaahate
 We are happy with the January 25 release of Padman
 akshay kumaar kii film pedman saamaajik mudde par aadhaarit he
 There was earlier discussion that Padman's date will be pushed forward due to Padmavat, but the producers are ready to release the film on the already scheduled date
 haalanki padmavat ke thik ek din baad relies hone vaali film ayyaari kii dats aage badha di gai
 Neeraj Pandey's film will now be released on 9 February
 kya is ek badi vajah se bhansaali chaahate hai 25 janvari ko hi relies ho 'padmavat'bataate chalem ki padmavat ko bharat or duniyabar main 2D, 3D or Imax 3D main relies kiya jayega
 The film is made in the trademark style of Sanjay Leela Bhansali
 paramount pikchars ke saath film ko distribute karne ke liye partnership kii he
 Ever since Bhansali started shooting for the film, Karni Sena has been continuously opposing
 aarope he ki film main aitihaasik tathyon ke saath chhedchhad kii gai he
 The character of Rani Padmini is misrepresented
 kaala hiran shikaar cese main jail main band salmaan khan kii jamaanat par faisle se pehle bada twist aa gaya he
 Judge of Jodhpur Sessions Court Ravindra Kumar Joshi, who is hearing the petition, has been transferred
 rajasthan hai court ne der raat 87 jajon ke ekamusth tabadalon kaa aadesh jari kiya he, jisamen joshi kaa naam bhi shaamil he
 This transfer is important because Salman Khan's bail is to be heard in Jodhpur Sessions Court at 10:30 am today
 shuukravaar ko bel par sunwaayee karte hue jaj rabindra joshi ne faisla surakshit rakh liya tha or ab unka transfar sirohi ho gaya he
 Chandrakumar Songra, now the new judge of the Jodhpur Sessions Court, will replace Chandrakumar Joshi
 aise main is baat par suspence bana he ki maujuuda jaj kaa tabadalaa hone ke baad bel par sunwaayee koun karegaa
 However, according to the information it is coming out that Chandrakumar will not handle the charge today
 agar aisi sthiti banati he or joshi bhi sunwaayee nahin karte hai to mumkin he ki bel yachika kisi or court ko transfar kar di jaae
 This has been happening in the routine
 transfar se kya badlaaye transfar isliye ahm he kyonki shuukravaar ko jaj rabindra joshi ne jamaanat par bahes ke dauraan ye tippanee kii thi, wo court order ko tafsil se dekhenge or unhone salmaan ke vakil kii tamaam daleel sunne ke baad bel par faisla aaj tak ke liye taal diya tha
 In such a case, instead of Ravindra Joshi, the new judge Chandra Kumar is heard on Bell or if the bail petition goes to some other court, then there is also the possibility that Salman may not get relief even today
 vakeelon kii ryhalanki, varisht vakil keke manan kaa kahana he ki chunki jaj joshi ne kal (shuukravaar) faisla surakshit rakh liya tha, isliye zyada sambhaavna is baat kii he ki vahi aaj salmaan kii jamaanat par faisla sunaaen
 At the same time, Maishpal Bishnoi, advocate of Bishnoi society in the black deer hunting case, says that such routine transfers have been done before in the month of April, so it is not fair to see it in any way
 baharhaal, abhi tak salmaan kii jamaanat par suspence kaayam he
 If Salman does not get bail today, he will have to spend at least two more days behind bars
 kal ravivaar hone kii vajah se sunwaayee nahin ho paaegi
 Hence today is a very important day for Salman and his family

 verma ne kaha, ‘vah ladki nirdosh he
 If it is not restored with respect, the state government will have to bear the consequences
 ’ yadav ke khilaaf aay se adhik sampatti maamle ke sandarbh main congress netaa ne kaha ki maamle kii jaanch sahi dhang se honi chahie
 He, however, said that Mulayam should not be sent to jail as i want to contest against him in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections

 The story of Rubaru Roshni should be kept separate from any kind of review

 It shows the time from 1984 to 2009 through three major events

 varshon se, india today group kii desh ke bijness skulon kii vaarshik ranking ko bharat main prabandhan shiksha kii sthiti par pramanik dastavej ke rup main sweekaar kiya jaataa rahaa he
 The survey has expanded its scope and analysis, which now presents every perspective associated with it, from the infrastructure of the institution to the quality of education and the returns of money spent on studies there
 bhale hi bhartiya bijness skool adhikansh vaishvik sansthaanon kii tulana main adhik saste hai phir bhi desh main ek management kii degree yaa diploma lenaa kaaphi kharchila he
 Although the amount of money spent for this can be a matter of debate, there can be no compromise on the quality of education
 isi pariprekshya main, india today group ke bijness skulon ko lekar kiye jane vaale surveykshan kaa mahatv saal-dar-saal badhata ja rahaa he
 Admission to the right business school is often the most important step in a career or a career
 bharat main management (prabandhan) peshey ke liye sarvocch rashtriya sanstha ol india management association (eieme) ke aankadon ke mutabik, har saal bharat ke 4,000 bi-skulon se lagbhag 3,60,000 emb chaatr snaatak kii degree lekar nikalate hai
 However, only 60 per cent of these graduates get jobs
 isliye har saal kiya jane vaala yah surveykshan management kii padhai ke icchhuk chaatro ke liye management shiksha ke rujhaanon ko samajhane main madadgaar sabit hota he
 For example, this year's survey conducted by the market research agency MDRA analyzes the performance of business schools since 2014
 aisa moolyankan isliye bhi bahut mahatvapurn ho jaataa he kyonki iiem or kuch paramparaagat rup se pratishthit nijee skulon ko chhodkar-shesh sabhi bijness skulon ko hitdharakon or visheshgyon kii niyamit aalochana kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 For example, the 2013 report 'b-school and Engineering Colleges Shut down-big Business Struggle' by the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (assocham) gave three warnings as follows: Many private schools some management gurus
 There is a business model of making some money through investment from
 kai emb skool media main bahut zyada dikhne ko aatur rahete hai
 They advertise several pages in leading newspapers to state their achievements
 emb ko udyog main safalataa nishchit karaane vaala ek anivaary pratishtha tag na maane
 
 
 Thoroughly evaluate your current situation, your long-term goals (and perhaps even the money available to you)
 report main yah bhi daawa kiya gaya he ki bhartiya prabandhan sansthaanon ke snaatakon ko chhodkar, desh ke duusare bijness skool teji se apni chamak kho rahe hai or unke snaatakon main se keval 10 pratishat hi rojgaar ke yogya hai
 Six years later, the scenario has not changed much
 vastav main, india today ke surveykshan main paaya gaya ki 2014 kii tulana main 2019 main kam nijee bijness skulon ko sheersh 25 main jagah mili he
 According to the India Skill Report 2019, the employability of students studying for MBA, prepared by talent assessment firm Wheebox, 41 in 2014
 02 pratishat thi, vah 2019 main ghatakar 36
 44 percent is left
 is aankade kaa sabase chaunkaane vaala tathy yah rahaa ki jahaan emb main aisi giravat ai vahiin anya sabhi stream main padhai karne vaale chaatro kii rojgaar kshamta 2014 ke 34 pratishat se badhkar 2019 main 47 pratishat ho gai
 Even global surveys have felt this gradual decline in the quality of management institutes and graduates in India
 switzraland sthit ek sheersh vaishvik bijness skool iemdi kii ore se taiyaar 2019 kii 'world tallent report' main 63 deshon main se bharat kii ranking 53wein sthaan par phisal gai jo ki 2005 main 29wein sthaan par thi
 The factors behind this decline were cited as not being relevant to the needs of business in the changed phase of India's curriculum
 yah ranking kaarysthal prashikshan, shiksha or bhashaa kaushal jaise kshetron main desh kii kshamtaaon ke moolyankan par aadhaarit thi
 Indicators also included investments made to refine local talent and countries' performance in attracting and retaining talent
 management chaatro ko naukari ke yogya na paae jane kaa sabase bada kaaran, jaruraton ke anuroop unke kaushal kaa na hona paaya gaya he
 One of the biggest challenges in the current job market is the need for usable, practical skills
 2016 kii world bank kii ek report main kaha gaya tha ki automation bharat main 69 fisad naukariyon kii jagah le legaa- isse bijness skulon ko nae kaushal kaa prashikshan dene kii jaruratein paidaa hui hai
 While this certainly brings new challenges, it also brings with it opportunities for new types of jobs with different skill requirements
 bijness skulon ko isko lekar yudhstar par taiyaari karne kii jarurat he
 Experts often complain that MBA courses are far behind in terms of market realities
 iske alaava, kai bijness skulon ke paathyakramon main vyavhaarik bijness prashikshan kii jagah kaaphi had tak shaikshanik pahaluon par hi dhyaan kendrit rahata he
 AIMA Director General Rekha Sethi had publicly stated that most B-schools are laggards in terms of meaningful internship and placement opportunities
 haalanki, pichley kuch varshon main management skulon ne apane vidhyaarthiyon ko internship ke dauraan udyogon main vyavhaarik gyaan pradaan karne ke maamle main acha pradarshan kiya he
 According to the online training and internship platform Internship, management graduates from top business schools have seen an increase in the number of internships and average stipends compared to last year
 ek or utsahjanak baat yah he ki kuch aise kshetron main bhi management se judi naukariyon ke avasar khule hai, jinhen pehle rojgaar paidaa karne vaale kshetron main nahin gina jaataa tha
 For example, despite the crisis in the agricultural sector, the demand for managerial skills in agribusiness and food sector is increasing
 top bijness skulon main kariyar vikalp ke rup main krishi-vyavsaay or gramin prabandhan kaa chayan karne vaale chaatro kii badhati sankhya, iskaa pramaan he
 They have a reason for doing so
 pratishthit niyokta gramin arthvyavastha ke jokhim kaa anubhav rakhane vaale management graduate ke vetan package main lagaataar vruddhi kar rahe hai
 For example, the Institute of Rural Management, Anand (irma), which currently offers a number of programs in rural and agri-business management, is currently expanding its capacity of 360 students to 480 to meet the growing demand for this particular sector
 Is planning to do santhaan ke 2019 ke snaatak batch ke liye ausat vetan main 36 pratishat kii chalaang darj kii gai
 Where it averaged 8 in 2015
 4 lakh rupye salanaa tha, vah 2019 main badhkar 11
 5 lakhs has been made annually
 ek or sakaaratmak pravriti jiskaa chaatro ke bich ubhaar ho rahaa he vah he naukari khojane ke bajaae udhyamita par dhyaan kendrit karnaa
 With the recent boom in start-ups, B-schools are now focusing on entrepreneurship-development programs by setting up incubation centers
 india today ke surveykshan main bhi paaya gaya he ki udhyamita main ruchi dikhaane vaale chaatro kii sankhya 2014 ke baad se badi he
 However, these are still small steps and business schools in India require very big changes
 asocham kii report ne management collejon ko apane buniyadi dhaanche main sudhaar, apni faikalti ko behatar prashikshan dene, udyogon ke saath taratakhyata badhaane par kaam karne, anusandhan or gyaan srijan par paisa kharch karne, saath hi achche shikshakon ko aakarshith karne ke liye faikalti ko acha bhugtan karne kii salaah di thi
 They should do all this, and fast
 surveykshan kaa tareekaindia today group ke liye sarvshereshth bijness skulon ke vaarshik surveykshan ke 2019 sanskaran kaa aayojan dilli kii pratishthit market research form marketing and deveopment research associats (emdiare) ne kiya
 In this process, schools that had been established at least five years before and had completed at least three graduate batches were offered schools in full-time classes for PGDM diplomas or MBA degrees
 in skulon se jaankaree hasil karne ke liye ek vastunishth prashnawali is sateekta se taiyaar kii gai ki usase vibhinn chaynit maanakon tathaa up-maanakon ke bare main prayek bindu par sansthaanon se naveenatam or sarvaadhik praasangik jaankaree praapt ho sake
 This questionnaire was also published on the websites of MDRA and Business Today
 bhagidaari ke maandand puure karne vaale desh ke 2,350 se adhik bijness skulon se i-mail, telephone or patrikaon main vigyaapan ke madhyam se sampark kiya gaya or nirdhaarit samyavadhi main apane santhaan se sambandhit data dene kaa aagrah kiya gaya
 As a result of these efforts, only 285 institutes across the country provided information about themselves in the desired time frame and these were considered for ranking
 vastunishth data praapt karne ke baad vishleshan ke pehle charan main in skulon kii ore se pradaan kii gai jaankaree ke har pahalu ko emdiare ke paas uplabdh jaankaree or database se jaancha gaya
 In its second phase, MDRA researchers conducted physical verification and audit of the participating business schools to ensure the accuracy and precision of the given data
 data kii pramanikta satyapit karne ke liye shodhakarta dalon ne 40 se adhik bijness skulon kaa daura kiya tha
 In these visits, the MDRA research team team matched the data provided with the original documents and the actual infrastructure facilities available
 bhautik audit ke dauraan mili aniyamittaaon ko antim vastuparak data main sanshodhit kiya gaya tha
 The total objective score of each institution was calculated by adding the scores (see table below) on the five standards of evaluation

 The election battle of the Karnataka Legislative Assembly has become interesting with UPA President Sonia Gandhi embarking on a campaign
 rahul gandhi ko congress adhyaksh kii kaman saunpane ke baad apni pehali chunavi raily ko sambodhit karte hue sonia gandhi ne pradhanmantri narendra modi par paanch sawaal daage, jiske jawaab main piem modi ne congress ke paanch saal ke paanch 'prapanch' gina die
 Addressing a public meeting in Bijapur, Karnataka, the former Congress president said that Modi is obsessed with Congress-free India and he has become the ghost of Congress-free India
 wo ek bade orietter or abhinayta kii tarah bhaashan dete hai
 If his speech can fill the nation's stomach, then he should give more speech
 sonia gandhike hamale ke baad bengalooru main chunavi raily ko sambodhit karte hue piem modi ne kaha ki congress kaa charitra ye he ki jin logon ko aaj jail main hona chahie, wo sarkaar main baithe hai
 He said that the Congress government of Karnataka has weakened the Lokayukta
 congress ke shashan main lokayukta par hamale hote hai
 He said that the Congress should have given its five-year account in this election, but it is not being done
 modi ne kaha ki congress sirf prapanch kar rahi he
 The claws of the Congress have ruined Karnataka not only by five blows, but also the future of the next generation
 congress sarkaar ke paanch saal ke prapanch ko har karnatakavasi janata he
 The entire Congress of Karnataka is lost in the imagination world today
 sonia gandhi ne piem modi se puche ye paanch sawaal1
 Which of the promises made to the public four years ago were fulfilled? 2
 chaar saal main desh ke kisaanon, yuvaaon, madhyam varg, mahilaon, bacchiyon, daliton or pichhadon ke liye aapane kya kiya?3
 What happened to your favorite promise to erase corruption? 4
 chaar saal baad bhi aakhirkaar lokapal kyon nahin laayaa gaya?5
 Modi will adopt the model of those who live around the stage in Karnataka to eradicate corruption, or will he adopt the model of his closest partner's son? PM Modi counted these five 'pranches' of the Congress - a family from Delhiipati to Gallipati, Nothing further than that

 Government of Corruption

 Atrocities of criminals

 cricket world cap ke itihaas main jo kabhi nahin hua wo ravivaar ko england ke lords maidan par dekhne ko mila
 The England team, known as the father of cricket, defeated New Zealand and won the title for the first time, on the other hand, they never got to see this victory in the same way as in a World Cup final match
 match taai hone ke baad super over hua or super over main bhi donon tiimon kaa score barabari par atak gaya, baavjood iske england kii team super champion ban gai
 The hosts have received this crown due to ICC rules, which says that if the match is tied in a super over, then the team with more boundaries in the innings is considered the winner
 is hisaab se dekha jaae to england ne apni 50 over kii pari or super over main milakar kul 26 boundry maari, jisamen 24 chauke or do chakke shaamil hai
 While New Zealand was able to put a total of 17 boundaries in their innings including Super
 samajhen boundry kaa puraa ganitlords ke maidan main toss jitkar newjiland ke captain ken williamson ne pehle ballebaaji karne kaa faisla kiya or 50 over khelte hue 8 wicket khokar 241 ran banaae
 New Zealand hit 14 fours and 2 sixes in their innings
 is tarah usne boundry ke sahare 68 ran banaae
 At the same time, New Zealand were able to get only a boundary in the super over when Jimmy Neesham hit a six
 yani newjiland ne apni 50 over kii pari or super main milakar kul 17 (14 chauke, 3 chakke) boundry lagaayee
 In this way, New Zealand scored 74 runs on the basis of boundary
 jabaki duusari taraf england ke ballebaajon kaa aatishi andaaj hi unki jeet kaa kaaran ban gaya
 Chasing a score of 241 runs, the batsmen of England also scored fiercely in the runs scored by England
 jesan roy, ben stokes, jos butler or beresto kii shandaar ballebaaji kii badaulat england ne 50 over kii pari main kul 22 chauke or 2 chakke lagaae
 While two fours Ben Stokes and Joss Butler hit the super over
 is tarah england ne super over samet apni puri pari main kul 26 boundry (24 chauke, 2 chakke) lagaayee or inke sahare 108 ran jutaaye
 That is, by putting the boundary, the English batsmen got a total of 108 runs, while the team of New Zealand was able to make only 74 i
e
 in terms of boundary, this difference was 34 runs
 haalanki, jeet kii asli vajah isisi kaa niyam hi bana jo kahata he ki super over main bhi match taai hone ke baad vahi team vijeta ghoshit kii jaati he, jisane apni pari main sabase zyada boundry lagaai hoti hai
 In this way, England managed to win the World Cup for the first time

 If Gopal Kanda is the same person who committed suicide by a girl and his mother also committed suicide after not getting justice, the case is still pending in court, and the person is out on bail

 Whether Gopal Kanda is innocent or a criminal, this law will be decided on the basis of evidence, but winning his election does not acquit him of crimes

 kiran bedi se intervyuu main kuch baaten jo saafe taur par samaj main aa gayi wo ye ki bijepi main aane ko lekar unke paas koi thos kaaran nahin hai
 The reason for asking her again and again the concrete reason is that in many programs she said many times that she does not want to come into politics at all
 april 2014 main enditivi ke kaarykram muqaabala main unhone yahan tak kaha ki raajnneeti main aane se pehle kam se kam teen saal kii training zaruri he
 But suddenly there is no logical answer to why his heart changed and why he joined BJP
 baar-baar kahati raheen ki nai sarkaar ke kaaran, narendra modi ke kaaran utsaah kaa sanchaar hua he, lekin aath maheene main aisa kya kiya he, sarkaar ne ki unke jaise dhur-virdohi ko aisa vishwaas ho gaya iskaa koi jawaab unke paas nahin
 From this it seems that the bets that BJP has imposed on them, they have also planted the same on BJP
 aap main kyon nahin gayi, poochne par kaha, ki kabhi jane kaa nahin sochaa or iske peeche kya kaaran he, bataaungi nahin
 When asked about the allegations of the Aam Aadmi Party, he also avoids it, saying that if i did not take charge then how did he think? And also that she will not answer any allegations
 shaayad unhen ye ehsaas he ki agar aaropon kaa jawaab detii raheen to fasane kii sambhaavna zyaada he
 That is why it is good to speak only a few lines
 maine unase poocha ki wo aravind kejariwal se dibet kyon nahin kar letin? is par bhi unhone bada sef line liya ki maahaul nahin he aise dibet ke liye
 People will not debate with civilization
 tamaasha nahin bananaa
 That is to say, the Aam Aadmi Party has also been said to be rude
 ye bhi kaha ki vidhansabha main bhashaa sabhy hogi, bina saboot ke log baat nahin karenge
 What is he afraid of? baat jab dilli ko alag rajya kaa darja dene kii or dilli police ke dilli sarkaar ke paas hone kii ai to saafe kaha ki isaki koi zarurat nahin lagati
 What is now, as it is, will work
 yani dilli kii lambey samay se jo maang rahi he use unhone saaf kuch nahin kaha
 On asking, he also told that he has not talked to Anna yet
 or haa dilli bijepi main virodh ke swar se nibatane kaa kaam bijepi kii leadership kaa he

 In the last election, there was a close fight between the two parties
 is baar madhya gujarat ke siyaasi ranbhumi main bijepi or congress donon kii pratishtha daanv par lagi hui he
 This time in central Gujarat, famous for co-operative institutions and milk production, the Congress is trying to break the fort
 yahi vajah he ki bijepi jahaan madhya gujarat ke shahari votaron ke bharose hai, to vahiin rahul is ilaake kii graminon ke sahare jeet kaa khwab sanjoye hue hai
 This time in central Gujarat, the issue of Patidar Reservation Movement in central Gujarat is prominent here, the effect on unemployment-business is burning, the issue of debt waiver of farmers is overshadowed
 congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi bijepi ko gherne ke liye berogari, jiesti or notebandi jaise muddon ko pramukhataa se uthaa rahe hai
 The 2012 election results out of a total of 182 assembly seats in Gujarat, Madhya Gujarat has 40 assembly seats
 pichley chunaav 2012 main donon partiyon ke bich kaante kaa muqabla rahaa he
 The BJP won 22 of the 40 seats in central Gujarat and the Congress won 18 seats
 bijepi kaa jahaan shahari siton par dabadabaa tha to vahiin congress gramin ilaakon kii siton par jeet hasil karne main kaamyaab hui thi
 BJP went ahead on the strength of Vadodara district
 lekin is baar siyaasi maahaul badla he
 This time there is some resentment among the businessmen
 notebandi or jiesti mudda bana he
 If these districts like Vadodara and Ahmedabad show their impact on GST and demonetisation then the election results can be shocking
 bijepi kaa garh ahmedabad-vadodramadhya gujarat main ahmedabad, dahod, kheda, aanand, panchmahal, vadodara jile aate hai
 Of these, Ahmedabad and Vadodara are strong bastions of the BJP
 ye donon jile shahari kshetra main hai
 Talking about the results of the last assembly election, BJP won 17 of the total 21 assembly seats in Ahmedabad, while the Congress got just 4 seats
 vadodara kii 13 siton main se bijepi ne 10 siton par jeet darj kii to congress ko 2 or 1 seat anya ke khate main gai
 The Congress dominance in rural areas, except Ahmadabad and Vadodara, the rural areas of central Gujarat are considered as Congress dominated
 madhya gujarat ke saat jilon se main paanch jilon dahod, kheda, aanand, panchmahal main gramin aabaadi zyada he
 In the last assembly elections, either the Congress has got a heavy upper hand in these districts or the contest has been equal
 madhya gujarat ke kheda jile kii 7 vidhansabha siton main congress ko 5 siten mili, to bijepi ko mahaj 2
 In the 7 assembly seats of Anand district, Congress got 4 seats, BJP 2 and others got 1 seat
 dahod kii 6 siton main se 3 bijepi or 3 congress ko milin
 There are 7 seats in Panchmahal district, out of which BJP got 4 and Congress got 3 seats
 bijepi ke liye notebandi jiesti bana sirdardado dashakon se patelon kaa zyaadaatar samarthan bijepi ke saath rahaa he, lekin is baar patidaar aarakshan andolan ke mudde kaa yahaan ke nateezon par prabhaav dikhaai degaa
 Seeing the displeasure of the Patidars, the BJP is expecting the Thakor and Koli community from the backward caste
 congress ko gramin ilaakon main to use siten milti rahi hai, lekin satta main vaapasi ke liye uski is baar shahari matadaataaon par najar he
 The wrong layer of makeup can spoil your look
 aise main bahut jaruri he ki acha dikhne ke liye achche mechap kaa chunaav kiya jaae
 Especially the base of the face is very important
 mechap artist anaalia himomi kahati hai, 'har twachaa alag hoti he
 The foundations for Fair, Light and Medium screens are also different
 iske baad bhi inamen dry, oili or combination skin kaa foundation alag hota he
 So in all these, it is necessary to choose the right base
 'inkaa kahana he ki dry skin ke liye powder kaa istemaal karnaa thik nahin he
 He told, 'cream or liquid foundation is perfect for dry skin
 ise nam sponge kii madad se chehre par lagaaein
 With this, it will look good on the whole face
 'saamaanya twachaa vaali mahilaayein bhi kriim yaa liquid foundation laga sakati hai
 It can also be applied with moist sponges
 iske baad foundation ko sahi base dene ke liye press powder kaa istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 With this, the foundation will remain on the face for a long time
 agar aapaki oili skin he to foundation ko stipling brush ke saath chehre par lagaaein or phir powder se phinishing den

 apni pradhanacharya or kuch anya shikshikaaon ko 21 ghante se bhi adhik samay tak skool ke hi ek kamare main bandhak banaae rakhane vaali 29 chaatraon ne adhyapikaon ko ucchadhikariyon dwaara yah vaada kiye jane ke baad antat azaad kar diya he ki unki uttarpustikaayen dobaaraa janchi jaaengi
 However, the school teachers, on the condition of anonymity, said that the decision to double check the answer books of the failed girl students would set a wrong precedent, and it is quite humiliating
 samasya somvaar ko dopaher baad lagbhag teen baje shuru hui thi, jab dakshini kolkata ke rishi aravindo balika vidhyalay kii 12veen kaksha kii pre-board pariksha main fail hone vaali 29 chaatraon ne apni pradhanacharya shrimati ghosh or kuch anya shikshakon ko gherkar ek kamare main band kar taala laga diya
 The students demanded that they should be given marks worth passing the pre-board examination, and to be allowed to appear in the board examination
 yah pariksha is skool kii 105 chaatraon ne di thi, jinamein se 76 paas ho gai thim
 The students who failed failed to allege that they were given incorrect numbers, and some of their parents also supported their daughters
 iske baad pradhanacharya shrimati ghosh ne kaha tha ki in chaatraon ko skool kii ore se paas nahin kiya jayega, jab tak rajya shiksha board ke ucchadhikari unhen aisa karne kaa aadesh nahin dete
 The Principal had given complete information about the matter via phone to all the concerned officials including the State Education Minister's Office, but the Education Minister also did not interfere
 police bhi somvaar ko hi skool pahunch gai thi, or sari raat baahar khadi rahi, lekin unhone bhi chaatraon ke khilaaf koi karrwai nahin kii thi
 At 11 am on Tuesday, two officers of the West Bengal Higher Secondary Council arrived at the school and held a meeting with the Principal and the teachers, nearly an hour after Achintya Pal, Secretary of the Higher Secondary Council announced that the failed girls' answerbooks would be rechecked, and It will be decided how many of these girls can be given passable numbers
 sabhi fail hui chaatraon se buudhvaar purvahn 11:30 baje council karyaalay main pahunchane ke liye kaha gaya
 The students also agreed to this, and they liberated their teachers
 tippaniyan After dealing with the whole case, however, Achintya Pal claimed that the Principal's rights had not been curtailed in the matter, but Principal Mrs
 Ghosh and other teachers said that the Council's decision was outrageous, and would set a wrong precedent
 darasal, jaise hi 12veen kaksha kii in chaatraon ne shikshikaaon ko azaad kiya, usee vakt bataaya gaya ki 10veen kaksha kii chatraayen bhi apni uttarpustikaon kii dobaaraa jaanch karaane kii maang kar rahi hai
 This whole matter has been described by academics as completely wrong
 jaankaree mili he ki isse pehle bhi chaatr-chaatraon dwaara apni maangon ko lekar collejon ke principal aadi kaa gheraav kiya jaataa rahaa he, lekin kisi skool main aisa kiya janaa abhootpurv he
 The problem started at around three o'clock in the afternoon on Monday, when 29 girls who failed in the 12th grade pre-board examination of Rishi Arvindo Balika Vidyalaya, South Kolkata, surrounded their Principal Mrs
 Ghosh and some other teachers and locked them in a room
 Locked
 chaatraon kii maang thi ki unhen pre-board pariksha main uteern hone laayak ank die jaaen, or board kii pariksha main baithne diya jaae
 This examination was done by 105 girl students of this school, out of which 76 passed
 fail hone vaali chaatraon kaa aarope he ki unhen galat tareeke se number die gaye, or inamen se kuch ke mata-pita ne bhi apni bacchiyon kaa saath diya
 After this, Principal Mrs
 Ghosh had said that these girls will not be passed on behalf of the school, unless the higher officials of the State Board of Education order them to do so
 pradhanacharya ne rajya ke shikshaamantri karyaalay sahit sabhi sambandhit adhikariyon ko phone ke jariye maamle kii puri jaankaree de di thi, lekin shikshaamantri ne bhi hastkshep nahin kiya tha
 The police also reached the school on Monday itself, and stood outside all night, but they too had not taken any action against the girl students
 mangalvaar purvahn 11 baje pashchim bengal hair secondary council ke do adhikari skool pahunche or pradhanacharya tathaa adhyapikaon ke saath baithak kii, jiske lagbhag ek ghante baad hair secondary council ke sachiv achintya paal ne ghoshnaa kii ki fail kii gai chaatraon kii uttarpustikaayen dobaaraa janchi jaaengi, or tay kiya jayega ki inamen se kitni chaatraon ko uteern hone laayak number die ja sakate hai
 All the failed girls were asked to reach the council office on Wednesday at 11:30 am
 chatraayen bhi is par sahamat ho gayi, or unhone apni shikshikaaon ko azaad kar diya
 The comments sara maamla nipatane ke baad haalanki achintya paal ne daawa kiya ki is maamle ko pradhanacharya ke adhikaron ko kam nahin kiya gaya he, lekin pradhanacharya shrimati ghosh tathaa anya adhyapikaon ne kaha ki council kaa yah faisla apmanjanak he, tathaa isse galat udhaaharan pesh hoga
 In fact, as soon as these students of class 12 liberated the teachers, at the same time it was told that students of class 10 are also demanding a re-examination of their answer books
 is puure maamle ko shikshavidon ne katai galat bataaya he
 It has been learned that even before this, the principals of colleges etc
 have been besieged by the students for their demands, but this is unprecedented in a school
 iske baad pradhanacharya shrimati ghosh ne kaha tha ki in chaatraon ko skool kii ore se paas nahin kiya jayega, jab tak rajya shiksha board ke ucchadhikari unhen aisa karne kaa aadesh nahin dete

 maharashtra main shaikshanik satr 2019-20 main aarthik taur par pichde saamaanya varg ke chaatro ko 10 fisadi savarna kota kaa laabh nahin mil paaegaa
 This quota will not be applied this year for admissions to medical and post graduate colleges
 supreme court ne savarna vidhyaarthiyon ko 10 fisadi aarakshan dene se manaa kar diya he
 The Supreme Court has clarified in this case that the admission process in the institutes started from November and the provision related to reservation has come later
 isliye ise pehle se lagu nahin kiya jayega
 25 students are going to be affected by this decision
 maharashtra sarkaar ko bhi court ke is faisle se jhatka laga he
 This year, economically backward upper castes will not get the benefit of upper caste reservation
 supreme court ne kaha ki agar savarna aarakshan ko lagu kiya jaataa he to admician kii puri prakriya prabhavit ho jaaegi
 The Supreme Court said that to give relaxation in admission to economically backward upper castes, first the number of seats should also be increased
 supreme court ne savarna aarakshan par sunwaayee karte hue is sambandh main antarim aadesh jari kiya he
 The Maharashtra government had appealed to dismiss the petition filed against the upper caste reservation
 supreme court ne kaha ki agar aarthik taur par pichde savarnon ko aarakshan kaa laabh diya ja rahaa he to niyat samay ke bheetar siton kii sankhya bhi medical collejon samet anya post graduate collejon main bhi badhaai jaani chahie thi jo ki is satr main badhanaa sambhav nahin he
 Hence the Savarna reservation should not be implemented for this session

 Former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister and senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad said that today is a dark day in Indian history
 bijepi kii sarkaar ne satta ke nashe main or vot hasil karne ke liye ek jatke main anuchhed 370 ke saath 35A ko khatm kar diya
 They are betraying a lot by messing with it
 sansad ke baahar bolte hue congress netaa gulam nabi aaazaad ne kaha ki pichley 70 varshon main kashmir main lakhon logon ne qurbaaniyaan di
 Whenever the state was dominated by terrorism, they fought
 kashmir kii awam or mukhyadhara kii raajnneetik partiyon ne aatankwaad kaa bhi muqabla kiya
 Security forces also countered terrorism
 modi sarkaar ne 370 main jammu-kashmir ko mili visheshadhikaar khatm kiye, raashtrapati kii manzoorisatta ke nashe main bijepigulam nabi aaazaad ne kaha, 'ek jatke main bijepi kii sarkaar ne power ke nashe main vot hasil karne ke liye ek purna rajya ko jiske paas apni samskruti he, sabhyata he, bhugolic kshetra ke hisaab se alag he, raajnneetik str par alag he, itihaas ke taur par alag he, ladakh jisamen muslim or buddha rahete hai, kashmir jisamen muslim or pandit rahete hai or sikh rahete hai
 Jammu has 60 per cent Hindu population, 40 per cent Muslim population
 sikh aabaadi he
 If someone had tied people here then Article 370 had put it
 'loktantr kaa kaala adhyygulam nabi aaazaad ne kaha ki anuchhed 370 main teenon kshetron main alag upbandh tha lekin bijepi ne ek jatke main teen chaar chizon kii khatm kar diya
 It will be written as a black chapter in the history of India
 gulam nabi aaazaad ne kaha, 'anuchhed 370 ke saath-saath anuchhed 35-e bhi khatm kar diya gaya
 As with him, it was not enough to ruin the kingdom, dividing the state
 ladakh ko centre shasit pradesh bana diya
 Made Jammu and Kashmir a union territory
 jammu kashmir main rajyapal nahin hoga, ab up-rajyapal hoga
 It was never thought of in a dream
 endie sarkaar ne jammu or kashmir kaa astitv hi khatm kar diya he
 Article 370 related to Kashmir is permanent or temporary? Know the opinion of the constitution experts Nabi Azad warned that they have divided the state but they do not know that India has a long border with China from one side
 pakistan ke saath lanbaa chaudaa border he
 Jammu and Kashmir borders with POK
 bharat inase kaise nipatega
 Messing with democracy Nabi Azad expressed displeasure that said that there has been play with democracy
 rajya kii ekta or intigrity ke saath khilwaad kiya gaya he
 It is a huge betrayal with the country
 jab kabhi pakistan or china ne hamalaa kiya he, kashmir ke log hameshaa ladaai main aage rahe
 When the attack took place in 1947, the youth, women and children of Kashmir fought before the arrival of the army
 mazdooron or netaaon ne laathiyon ke saath ghuspaithiyon ko roka tha
 Ghulam Nabi Azad said that in a border state, we cannot stop an enemy with only army
 vahaan ke sthaneey logon kaa bhi samarthan jaruri he
 People were abolished at the political level
 aarthik str par khatm kar diya gaya
 The head of the country was Kashmir, which has been bitten by the Bharatiya Janata Party government
 jaaniye 35A kaa itihaas, aakhir jammu-kashmir main kyon machaa he is par bavalbina sir ke hua bharat!gulam nabi aaazaad ne kaha ki aaj sir ke bina bharat he
 Kashmir was the head of the country
 aaj desh kaa sir kaat diya gaya
 The country has been weakened
 loktantr ke saath khilwaad kiya gaya he
 Whatever secular parties are there from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, they should stand with the people of Kashmir
 gulam nabi aaazaad ne kaha ki kashmir ko tukdon main vibhajit kar diya gaya he
 He accused the central government of not baiting leaders of opposition parties in the Rajya Sabha

 adaalat in masalon se tang bhi dikhi or kai baar bahes ke dauraan chutki bhi lee, taaki tanaav zyaada na bad jaae
 The Delhi High Court got the DDCA permission from the MCD keeping in mind that there is no major loss of players or cricket-related fans and other people, but at the same time several conditions have been laid before the DDCA
 isliye 3 disambar se hone vaala test match adhikariyon ke liye ab bhi badi chunauti he
 The fourth test of the gandhi-mandela series will be held in Delhi, it was approved with some conditions, but the court also made it clear that the DDCA will come to court and play the game on the field
 Will be able to court ne kaha ki emsidi didisie ko provisional certificket de de, lekin ye bhi kaha ki match ke aayojan ke liye unhen fir department, bijli vibhaag, aapadaa prabandhan vibhaag or jal vibhaag se enosi (no objection certificket) lene kii zarurat hogi
 The court also said that DDCA will also be responsible for any accidental accident during the match
 didisie ke vakil sunil mittal court se guhaar lagaate rahe ki wo ye shart na rakhe ki didisie dobaaraa match ke liye adaalat main guhaar na lagaae
 Because, in such a situation, during the T20 World Cup to be held in Delhi next year, it can be difficult, but the court asked them to resolve the internal issue
 sunil mittal kaa maananaa he ki emsidi ke no objection certificket ke baad intertenment tex yaa duusari vajahon se match karwaane main mushkil nahin honi chahie, lekin ye maamla ab bhi adaalat main he or is par faisalaa aana baaqi he
 The court also agreed that the match will be under the supervision of retired judge Justice Mukul Mudgal
 iskaa matlab he ki match ke dauraan didisie ke adhikariyon par kadi nazar rahegi
 It was a big relief for the party which is still upset with DDCA

 He said, 'we are happy that the match will be under the supervision of Justice Mukul Mudgal and he will also keep an eye on the accounts of DDCA during this time

 If that were the case, i would have approved the MP ticket

 a month and a half after his daughter's death, the Pai family of Mumbai has once again come to Ahmedabad to plead with the police to find out the people responsible for their daughter's death
 darasal, 13 may ko 37 saal kii manjula pai subah kareeb 8
 She was going right in front of Rajpath Club in Ahmedabad at 30 pm when a vehicle hit her
 is durghatana main vah buree tarah ghayal ho gai or tabhi sadak se hi kisi ne ambulance ko bulaayaa or use aspataal le jaaya gaya
 Manjula worked as a librarian at the Center for Environment Education, Ahmedabad
 ghatana se thik ek din pehle puraa parivaar ek saath haridwar main chhuttiyaan manaa rahaa tha
 Manjula's parents and sister had got a train ticket to Mumbai, so they left the train at night
 lekin manjula ko ahmedabad kaa train kaa tikat nahin mil paaya tha, isliye vah hawaiyatra se pichhali raat hi ahmedabad pahunchi thi or subah daftar jate vakt uske saath yah haadasa ho gaya
 The family of the girl had just reached Bhopal on the way on the train that she got the news of this accident
 parivaar bhopal se hawaiyatra kar tabadatod ahmedabad pahunchaa
 His entire focus was on saving his daughter
 uske parivaar waalon ko yah ummid thi ki police is maamle kii gambhirtha se jaanch kar rahi he, isliye zimmedaar log pakade jaaenge
 But his family did not know Gujarati language, so he also had trouble with the language
 jab doctoron ne jawaab de diya ki ab unki beti kii bachane kii koi gunjaaish nahin he, tab manjula kii ichha ke mutabik parivaar ne uski ankhen or liver anya vyaktiyon ko donnet kar die taaki kisi or kii zindagi bachaai ja sake
 After his last rites, the family moved to Mumbai and waited for any news of investigation from the police, but nothing happened
 ab unhen jaankaree mili he ki police ne to bahut pehle hi yah maamla band kar diya he, yah kehete hue ki unhen is maamle main koi saboot nahin mil paaya he
 Now that family has returned to Ahmedabad again demanding justice
 parivaar kaa aarope he ki ye sambhav hi nahin he ki kisi ne dekha na ho, kyonki subah ke vakt is road par baari bheed hoti he
 It is also alleged that this incident happened right in front of the Rajpath Club, why is CCTV footage not being found
 rajpath club ahmedabad ke sabase badi klbon main se ek he, phir bhi police yah kyon kah rahi he ki unhen sisitivi footage nahin mila paaya he
 The family is also alleged to have been unable to provide CCTV footage of the same time, despite being a couch-clubbed club
 lekin police kaa kahana he ki ab tak koi bhi gavaah is maamle main saamne nahin aayaa he
 The police had also written a letter to the Rajpath club seeking CCTV footage, but the reply came from there that they did not have any CCTV footage available due to a malfunction in their server that day
 tippaniyan The family believes that if the police had investigated the matter seriously, it could have taken CCTV footage from other places as well, but it is not ready to investigate the matter
 baat sirf police kii nahin, samaaj ke logon kii bhi he ki bhari sadak par ek mahila ke saath haadasa ho jaataa he, uski maut ho jaati he, lekin gavaahi dene ke liye ek bhi vyakti saamne nahin aata he
 In fact, on May 13, 37-year-old Manjula Pai, about 8 in the morning
 30 baje ahmedabad ke rajpath club ke thik saamne se ja rahi thi, tabhi kisi vaahan ne use joardaar takkar maari
 She was badly injured in the accident and then someone from the road called an ambulance and rushed her to the hospital
 manjula ahmedabad ke centre for anvyrement ajukeshan main bataur librorian kaam karti thi
 Just a day before the incident, the entire family was holidaying together in Haridwar
 manjula ke mata-pita or bahan ko mumbai kii train kaa tikat mil gaya tha, isliye wo log raat ko train se nikle the
 But Manjula was not able to get a train ticket to Ahmedabad, so she reached Ahmedabad last night by plane and this incident happened to her while going to office in the morning
 yuvati kaa parivaar train main raste main abhi bhopal tak hi pahunchaa tha ki is durghatana kii khabar unako mili
 The family flew from Bhopal to reach Taburtad Ahmedabad
 unka puraa dhyaan apni beti ko bachaane main hi rahaa
 His family hoped that the police were investigating the matter seriously, so those responsible would be caught
 lekin uske parivaar ko gujarati bhashaa nahin aati thi, isliye bhashaa kii bhi unhen vahaan takalif hui
 When the doctors replied that there was no longer any chance for her daughter to escape, the family donated her eyes and lever to other individuals as Manjula wished so that someone else's life could be saved
 uskaa antim sanskaar kar parivaar mumbai chalaa gaya or intazaar karata rahaa ki police kii ore se jaanch kii koi khabar aegi, lekin aisa kuch nahin hua
 They have now received information that the police have closed the case long ago, saying that they have not been able to find any evidence in this case
 ab vah parivaar insaaf kii maang ko lekar dobaaraa ahmedabad pahunchaa he
 The family alleges that it is not possible that no one has seen, because in the morning there is a huge crowd on this road
 aarope ye bhi he ki ye ghatana thik rajpath club ke thik saamne hui, iske baavjood sisitivi footage kyon nahin mil rahaa he
 Rajpath Club is one of the biggest clubs in Ahmedabad, yet why are the police saying that they have not been able to find CCTV footage
 parivaar ko yah bhi aarope he ki aamtaur par sofesticated club hone ke baavjood usee vakt kaa sisitivi footage kyon muhaiyaa nahin ho paaya he
 But the police say that so far no witness has appeared in this case
 police ne rajpath club ko sisitivi footage kii maang ko lekar ek patr bhi likhaa tha, lekin vahaan se jawaab aayaa ki us din unke sarwar main kharabi ho jane kii vajah se unke paas koi sisitivi footage uplabdh nahin he
 The comments parivaar kaa maananaa he ki police agar is maamle kii gambhirtha se jaanch karti, to wo duusari jagahon se bhi sisitivi footage le sakati thi, lekin wo is maamle kii jaanch ke liye sanjeeda nahin he
 It is not just about the police, but also the people of the society that a woman gets into an accident on the road, she dies, but not a single person comes forward to testify
 ghatana se thik ek din pehle puraa parivaar ek saath haridwar main chhuttiyaan manaa rahaa tha

 The Indian government was successful in getting them released after a lot of struggle

 One day when Maruti woke up from his sleep, he started feeling hungry
 unhone kuch khaane ke liye apane aas-paas dekha
 After which, he saw a red ripe fruit on a tree
 apni bhukh mitaane ke liye maaruti us fal ko khaane ke liye nikal pade
 In fact, the red fruit which was seen on the tree of Maruti was not anyone else but Suryadev himself
 jis din yah ghatana hui vah din amavasya kaa tha or raahu surya ko grahan lagane vaale the
 But before he could do this, Hanuman ji swallowed the sun
 iske baad rahu ne is vishay par indra dev se sahaayta maangi
 Even when Indradev's repeated insistence, when Hanuman ji did not free Suryadev in Bal Hut, Indra got angry on his face with his gun
 jisaki vajah se suryadev to mukt ho gaye lekin unke prahar se maaruti moorchhit hokar akaash se dharti kii taraf gir pade
 After this, Pawan Dev becomes angry with this incident and takes Maruti to a cave and becomes angry
 jisaki vajah se prithvi par jeevon main traahi- traahi much uthati he
 To prevent this destruction, all the gods urge Pawan Dev to abandon their anger and flow life on earth
 jiske baad sabhi dev maaruti ko vardaan main kai divya shaktiyaan pradaan karte hai or saath hi vardaan dete hai ki maaruti ko unke bhakt hanuman naam se puujenge
 From that day Maruti's name became Hanuman
