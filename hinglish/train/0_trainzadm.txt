 Now the NDA government will amend the Cinematography Act, 1952 by implementing the recommendations of the Mudgal Committee which governs the film certification process in India

 Others related to certification also accuse producers of involvement in corruption

 Due to the large number of resignations from the board and its reorganization, in today's digital era, a big debate has started on the need for the censor board
 film produsar or geetkaar amit khanna ise peeche kii ore le jane vaali soch kehete hai
 "in the digital era, where more and more people have online access to a wide variety of content, censoring movies is a primal step
" ’’ ve yah bhi maanate hai ki koi bhi sarkaar niyantran kaa adhikaar apane haath se nahin jane degi
 The role of the censor board should be of film ratings, not to suggest or ban cuts, "if people find a film objectionable, they have the right to go to the appellate body, but only after the film is screened
" ’’samson ne pehle bhi suzav diya tha ki khud hi sensor karnaa yani self sensorship or produsar-diarector kii ore se svaichhik grading hi ekmaatr rasta he
 Tiwari also believes that certification is a concept that has passed and rules have to be prepared for films as per the rules that regulate television programming and advertising
 "heavy penalties for those who violate the code to prevent it Should be applied
 ’’samson kaa kaarykaal pichley saal hi khatm ho gaya tha lekin modi sarkaar ke pehle soochna or prasaaran mantri prakaash javdekar ne nae adhyaksh ke chayan tak un se pad par bane rahane kaa anurodh kiya tha
 Tiwari and Rathore refute allegations of political interference and lack of money
 tiwari kaa kahana he, ‘‘sibiefasi ke liye fund board ko jari kar diya jaataa he
 i did not have to sign any file
 ’’ rathod bhi sahamat hai, ‘‘board ke paas paryaapt bajet praavdhaan hai, lekin vah uskaa istemaal nahin kar paaya
 For example, for the second administrative expenditure, Rs 25 lakh
 tay hai lekin 31 disambar, 2014 tak koi kharch nahin kiya gaya
 Rathore also explains how the government stood with the CBFC in the case of banning two films Haider and PK
 philhal to raajnneeti sibiefasi kaa daaman chhodti najar nahin aa rahi
 The first thing is that Rathore himself believes that the country is not ready for self-certification yet, "if there is no organization to take responsibility, it will be difficult for the audience to choose

 In this journey of 50 years, Amitabh Bachchan has portrayed many types of characters
 philhal amitabh bachchan gulabo sitabo main ek alag tarah kii bhoomika ke liye charchaa main chal rahe hai
 Everyone knows that Amitabh started his career with Saat Hindustani in 1969, but few people know how much fees Amitabh Bachchan received for this film
 reports ke mutabik pehali film saat hindustani ke liye amitabh bachchan ko mahaj 5 hajaar rupee fees dene kii baat rakhi gai thi
 Despite knowing that this fee was very low, Amitabh worked in the film Saat Hindustani
 iske peeche vajah yah thi ki amitabh pehla mauka ganvaana nahin chaahate the
 Although the film flopped badly at the box office, Amitabh received the National Award for this role
 View this post on instagramamitabh Bachchan February 15, 1969
 i had signed k Abbas's film Saat Hindustani
 He was a close family friend
 During my school and college holidays, i would go to Abbas saab and beg him to give me a passing shot in his films so he would give me small parts
 But, in Saat Hindustani, he gave me one of the leading roles
 Abbas saab needed a heroine
 He saw Neena Singh, a friend of mine from Delhi, at my house and wanted to know if she would act in a film
 She agreed
 Neena asked me if i could give a picture of her friend who lived in Calcutta (as Kolkata was then known) and worked in Bird and Co, to Abbas saab
 Her friend, she said, was interested in cinema and wanted to become an actor
 The photograph showed a very tall man standing outside Victoria Memorial
 Abbas saab said the man had to come to Mumbai at his own expense for the audition
 He also said he did not know when the audition would take place so the aspiring actor would have to wait and would not be paid for it
 That is how Amitabh Bachchan landed up in Mumbai
 i was the one who took him to Abbas saab's office
 In the evening, i was given the dirty job of offering Amitabh Rs 5,000 for the entire film, whether it took one year or five to make
 Bunty (ajitabh) and Amitabh looked at each other
 They were absolutely shocked! Amitabh reluctantly agreed as he was desperate to act
 He got the role of the poet's friend in Saat Hindustani
 When my father got the letter from Satyajit Ray saying i could work with him, i had to give up Saat Hindustani
 So i left for Calcutta and Amitabh got the role of the poet that i was supposed to play
 It was a very powerful role! He made a tremendous impression on people in a sequence where his foot gets cut with a razor and he has to walk across the border from Goa to India

 Amitabh is a well-known artist, it is easy for him to do the role of Gulabo sitabo, but the prosthetic make-up required for the role is quite difficult
 is dard bhare anubhav ke bare main amitabh ne apane blog par likhaa bhi he
 Amitabh wrote, "there are certain rules in the western film making industry where as per the law the prosthetic cannot be used for more than three days
 ise dobaaraa karne se pehle chehre ke liye ek yaa do din kaa brake

 12 march 1993 kaa din tha
 Daily life was running in Mayanagari Bombay (now Mumbai)
 lekin dopaher 1 baje ke baad wo daudta shahar tham sa gaya tha
 The city was rocked by 12 consecutive blasts
 shahar main serial blast hue the
 257 people died in those blasts, while 1400 people were injured in some way or the other
 ab aap soch rahe honge ki aakhir ham mumbai blast kaa zikr aaj kyon kar rahe hai
 Actually, like Malegaon, there was a car angle in the Mumbai blast too
 rubina kaa vine conectionbombay shahar ko 2 ghante 10 minute main tabah karne ke liye kai sthanon par bam plant kiye gaye the
 The vehicle used to plant the bomb was registered in the name of a woman
 haalanki bataaya gaya tha ki wo mahila us gaadi kaa istemaal nahin karti thi
 In fact, after those serial blasts, a 150-member team of police was deployed to nab the accused
 jiskaa netritv disipi rakesh maaria kar rahe the
 While the police were trying to connect all the links related to the blasts, the police had one and a scooter in the hand during the investigation
 un donon vaahanon main hand grenade or anya hathiyaar maujuud the
 Vans and scooters were apparently a big way for police to reach the accused
 lihaaja jaanch ke dauraan police ko pataa chalaa ki wo vine ek mahila ke naam par registerd thi
 The name of the woman was Rubina Memon
 uskaa kasoor ye bhi tha ki wo mumbai dhamaakon ke sajeeshkarta tiger memon kii rishtedaar bhi thi
 He was arrested
 police ne serial blast maamle kii chargeshit main use bhi aaropee banaaya tha
 The trial in the case continued in the TADA court and in 2006, 13 years after the blasts, the TADA court of Mumbai sentenced Rubina to life imprisonment along with three other accused
 haalanki uske pati suleman ko is maamle main bari kar diya gaya tha
 Then Rubina and her lawyer told the court that even though the van was in her name, she did not use it
 use unka koi rishtedaar chalaata tha
 Subsequently, in December 2016, the Mumbai High Court had also rejected the petition seeking release of Rubina Memon on furlough
 kyonki use tada adaalat ne aatanki gatividhiyon main sanlipt rahane ke maamle main doshi qaraar diya tha
 Since then, Rubina is lodged in Yerwada Jail in Pune
 us maamle ke mukhya aropiyon ko to sajaa ho chuki he
 Some of the accused are still absconding
 16 june 2017 ko tada court ne is maamle main 7 doshiyon par faisla sunaaya tha
 Sadhvi Pragya's motorcycle connection Many important evidence was found by the investigating agencies against the accused Sadhvi Pragya Singh in the Malegaon blast case
 unamem sabase ahm saboot tha, dhamaake main istemaal kii gai motorcycle, jo pragna singh ke naam par panjikrut thi
 Apart from this, phone conversations between Sadhvi Pragya and the suspected assailant were received by some of the agencies
 jisase pataa chalaa tha ki dhamaake kii sajeesh rachane ke liye bhopal main ek baithak yojit kii gai thi
 In which Sadhvi was also present
 darasal, maharashtra aatankwaad-rodhi daste (aties) ne use maalegaanv visphot ke pramukh shadyantrkariyon main se ek bataaya tha
 On September 29, 2008, 7 people were killed and 101 were injured during the blast in Malegaon
 oktober 2008 main pragna singh ko giraftaar kiya gaya tha
 She is currently facing charges including murder, attempt to murder, criminal conspiracy, and promoting enmity between various groups based on religion, including the Unlawful Activities Act (prevention)
 maalegaanv dhamaake ke baad court ne paaya ki aaropee pragna ne aatank failaane or samaaj main sampradayik daraar paidaa karne ke uddeshy se is sajeesh kii yojana banaai thi
 The bomb was fitted into a golden colored LML Freedom motorcycle with an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) to explode
 wo motorcycle pragna singh thakur ke naam par panjikrut thi
 The ATS had earlier arrested Sadhvi on the same basis
 aties kaa kahana tha ki sadhvi ne apane kareebi sahyogi raamji kalsangra ko visphot ke liye motorcycle muhaiyaa karai thi
 He is also a wanted accused in the case
 2011 main is maamle kii jaanch aties se lekar rashtriya jaanch agency (NIA) ko saunp di gai thi
 But in 2016, when the NIA filed its first final chargesheet in the court, it gave a clean chit to Sadhvi Pragya
 enie ne kaha ki aties ne record main jis ahm saboot yani motorcycle kaa zikr kiya he, unki jaanch main paaya gaya ki vah sadhvi ke naam par panjikrut to thi, lekin uskaa prayog pragna kaa kareebi ramchandra kalsangra karata tha
 The NIA argued that for two years, Sadhvi was not involved in the incident so that the motorcycle was driven by Kalsangra
 isliye sadhvi ke khilaaf koi maamla nahin banataa tha
 On this basis, Pragya Singh got bail after 9 years
 vah ise apni ungaliyon ko naram banaae rakhane ke liye karte the, jiskaa phayda gend ke ghumaav main bhi mila tha
 Neither the ICC existed in that period nor were there strict cricket rules like today
 us samay ke halaat or niyamon kaa jamshedji ne puraa-puraa phayda uthaaya

 During the release of Boria Majumdar's book at Kolkata's Fanatic Sports Museum, "greg was writing his email and i was sitting next to him
" maine dekha ki vah bisisiai ko kuch likh rahe the or maine dada (saurav) ko jaakar iske bare main bataaya
 i said that he is writing to the BCCI and this is a very serious matter
 'greg chapel ko may 2005 main bharat kaa coach banaaya gaya tha or ek saal baad zimbabwe daure ke dauraan saurav ganguli ko captaini se hataa diya tha
 Chappell has also been written in Sachin Tendulkar's autobiography 'playing it My Way', in which Harbhajan Singh has said, 'it has caused so much damage to Indian cricket that it took at least three years to recover from it
 'jahir khan ne chapel ke bare main kaha, 'unka apana vyaktigat agenda tha
 'asked who was the most memorable moment for him as a cricketer? Sehwag said, 'my first Test century
 ' sahvaag ne 2001 main dakshin africa ke khilaaf 105 ran banaae the
 Sehwag further said, 'when i used to play odis, people used to say that i cannot play Test cricket
 isliye jab main pehla shatak lagaaya, to ganguli ko gale lagaaya, kyonki unhone mujhe test cricket main khilne kaa mauka diya
 i wanted to prove myself
 'unhone ganguli or coach jon rhite dwaara salaami ballebaaj ke rup main khilaae jane ke prashn par kaha, 'maine unase kaha sachin ne hameshaa ballebaaji kii shuruyaat kii he or saurav ne bhi salaami ballebaaj ke rup main hi khelaa he
 Let me bat in the middle order
 lekin, saurav or jon ne kaha ki aapako baahar baithna padegaa kyonki team main tumhaare liye yahi ek jagah he
 ' ajtak ke oparation dharmantaran ke baad centre sarkaar harakat main aa gai he
 Breaking silence in the case, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh said that strict action will be taken against the Popular Front of India (PFI)
 is maamle main agenciyaan jameen par kaam kar rahi hai
 In a special conversation with Aaj Tak, the Union Home Minister said that action has been taken after the revelation of conversion in Aaj Tak's sting operation
 unhone kaha ki maamle ke doshiyon ko bakhsha nahin jayega
 This is the first time such a high level of response has come from the Central Government
 mana ja rahaa he ki ab sarkaar jald hi PFI or isaki kattarpanthi charity par jald bain laga sakati he
 Earlier, Union Minister of State for Home Hansraj Ahir said that no person can perform conversions by force
 ahir ne yah bhi kaha ki ajtak ne jo sting oparation kiya he, usamen yah saaf jaahir ho rahaa he ki piefai kii ghaatak harakatein chal rahi he
 This work is being carried out with help from outside countries of the country
 isamen aatanki sanghathan bhi shaamil hai, jo dharmantaran ke is kaam main lage hue hai
 Union Minister of State for Home Aheer had come to complain
 Union Minister of State for Home Affairs Ahir said that what you have brought to the fore, when i went to Kerala in may-june, i had also received such complaint
 isamen kaha gaya tha ki ek maheene main ek hajaar se zyada logon ke dharmantaran karaae gaye
 Hansraj Ahir said that we have also sought a report from the police there, how is this nexus of conversion going on? Provide information about it
 hansraj ahir ne bataaya ki dijipi ne bhi kaha ki 3 maheene main 3000 logon ke dharmantaran kii jaankaree unke paas hai
 The NIA is investigating the matter when asked whether the Home Ministry will take action against the people or organizations involved in it
 Union Minister of State for Home Hansraj Ahir said that the revelations that Ajatak has made, it is clear that the manner in which money is also sending the Terror Organization from abroad, through which people in a state like Kerala are busy converting
 isse spasht he ki kaise dharmantaran ho rahaa he? grih rajya mantri ne kaha ki ajtak ne jo sting kiya he, jisamen PFI kii manshaa saamne aa rahi he
 Forcible conversion is a crime
 kendra sarkaar isamen roak lagane ke liye kaam kar rahi he
 The NIA is investigating this issue
 hansraj ahir ne kaha- jarur hogi karrwaikendriya grih rajyamantri hansraj ahir ne kaha ki ab is baat kaa khulaasa ajtak se saamne aa rahaa he
 We will definitely take action
 ye kaam galat he
 Whatever report NIA has to come has come
 aise main (PFI) par bain lagane kii zarurat padegi to zarur bain lagegaa
 It will also be monitored
 kendriya grih rajyamantri hansraj ahir ne bataaya ki press ke madhyam se koi bhi chiz saamne laai jaati he to usko ham dekhte hai
 MHA will study the entire operation and take action based on it
 ahir ne bataaya ki ho saktaa he oparation kaa istemaal supreme court main bhi ho jaye
 PFI has been dismissive of the allegations of conversion, publicly the Popular Front of India of Kerala (PFI) describes itself as the champion of unity and equality
 saath hi dharm parivartan, hawala funding, jaanaleva hamale or aatankwaad se judaav ke aaropon ko lagaataar khaarij karata rahaa he
 However, Aaj Tak's Special Investigative Team, in its investigation, has exposed the real face of this organization, which describes itself as charitable
 ajtak ke under cover reporters ne aise kiya tha khulaasactak ke under cover reporters ne chupe camere par PFI ke sheersh padaadhikariyon ke munh se aise khulaase kaid kiye hai jo sakate main daal dene vaale hai
 Whether it is a mass conversion, illegal funding, or the ultimate goal of making India a predominantly Islamic country
 sabake bare main inhen khud hi sab kabool karte dekha-suna ja saktaa he
 The PFI is already on the National Investigation Agency (NIA) investigation radar

 The threat of Third World War is constantly hovering over the world with the way North Korea and America are threatening to see each other every day
 khatra isliye bhi zyaada he, kyonki uttar korea ke taanashaah marshall kim jong un ke bare main kaha jaataa he ki wo kisi kii nahin sunata
 In such a situation, if a war broke out by mistake, then it will be difficult to guess what will be the result
 lekin ab south korea kii ek news agency kijangko lekar jo tazaa report taiyaar kii he, uski mahaz ek pankti hi kisi ke bhi rongte khadey kar sakati he
 According to the report, the first attack on South Korea and Japan will kill more than 2 million people in one stroke
 maare jaaenge 20 lakh logtrump or kim ke talkh lahazon ke baad ab zyaada kuch bachataa nahin he kehane sunne ko
 Just understand that the gunpowder is late
 magar apni zaati dushmani maanakar jis tarah ye donon netaa ek duusare ko bura bhala kah rahe hai
 It is certainly not auspicious sign for the world
 kyonki is garmagarmee main kahin agar jang shuru ho gai to bahut mushkil hogi
 If Kim Jong-un attacked South Korea and Japan in the midst of growing tension with the US, then in a jolt about two million people would lose their lives
 itnaa hi nahin is hamale main kuch hajaar yaa kuch lakh nahin, balki kareeb 70 lakh log ghayal bhi honge
 According to the news agency's report, the dreaded southsouth Korean news agency yonhop has produced this intimidating report
 agency ke report ke mutabik north korea kii maujuuda takat ko dekhte hue is tarah kii ashanka jataai gai he ki jang ke halaat korian peninsula ke liye bahut ghaatak honge
 The report comes at a time when the US is flying bombers from near North Korea and North Korea is firing missiles at Japan
 bhayankar hogi tabaahikun kitna taqatvar he ab is baat ke zyaada myne bache nahin hai
 Because North Korea is also equipped with nuclear bombs
 lihaaza pahal kahi se bhi ho tabaahi bhayankar hone vaali he
 In such a situation, the world is trying to mediate between these two leaders
 khud america ke purv raashtrapati jimi carter ne pahal kii apil kii he
 Jimmy Carter has expressed his desire to go to North Korea on behalf of the Trump administration to resolve the two countries
 purv raashtrapati jimi carter kaa kahana he ki yuddh ke halaat ko dekhte hue vah america prashasan kii taraf se uttar korea ja sakate hai
 He has expressed his wish to Lt
 General HR mcmaster, his friend and Trump's security adviser
 lekin abhi tak koi sakaaratmak jawaab nahin mila he
 Kim could strike first
 According to Jimmy Carter, who was President of the US from 1977 to 1981, it is difficult to guess anything about Kim Jong Un
 agar use shaq ho gaya ki america uttar korea ke khilaaf kuch bada karne ja rahe hai to wo usase pehle hi bada kadam uthaa legaa
 This attack can also be a nuclear attack
 jisase dakshin korea, japan or prashanth kshetra main sthit america thikaane barbaad ho sakate hai
 Carter has already visited Pyongyang during Bill Clinton's term
 tab unhone uttar korea ke tatkaaleen shaasha kim il sung se samjhaute kii koshish kii thi
 Who was Kim Jong Un's grandfather
 america ranneeti ho sakati he naakamahalanki is baat kii ummid kam hi he ki trump prashasan samjhaute ke liye purv america raashtrapati carter ko uttar korea bheje
 Because Kim Jong is not a direct threat to America
 lekin uski sanak kaa khamiyaaza japan or dakshin korea ko uthaanaa pad saktaa he
 The devastation of Japan and South Korea means that many American bases in East Asia will suffer and the effect that the US strategy of capturing China will fail
 hamale se peeche nahin hatega kimambzarwar research foundation ne bhi ashanka jataai he ki bhale uttar korea kii takat itani na ho ki wo puri tareeke se america tak apni mixilon se maar kar sake lekin itnaa jarur he ki vah tseol or japan ko barbaad kar degaa
 In such a situation, if there is a war, then not only Tokyo, Seoul will also be the target of North Korea
 aapako bataa den ki uttar korea se tseol mahaz 40 mile kii duuri par he
 Which will come easily in his range
 uttar korea baar-baar is baat ko kah chukaa he ki agar america koi bhi pahal karata he, to use gambhir parinaam bhugatne honge
 And it will not back down from targeting its missiles with South Korea, Japan and Guam

 Maharashtra Congress veteran Sanjay Nirupam has also threatened to leave the party

 Union Minister Giriraj Singh, while reacting to journalists on the issue of ordinance on Ram temple in Ayodhya, said that since the Mughal period not only the conversion of Hindus was done, but the caste was divided to divide Hindus
 Dirty high politics was broken into pieces as part of a conspiracy

 Now the remaining Hindus are also trying to divide them into pieces in the name of caste

 aage aaen musalamangiriraaj ne aage kaha ki ayodhya main ram ke mandir ke nirmaan ke liye musalamaanon ko aage aana chahie
 After the partition based on the religion of India, Hindus were forcibly converted to Islam in Pakistan or Hindus migrated from Pakistan
 unhone kaha ki pakistan main chun-chun kar mandiron ko todaa gaya he
 Despite the plight of Hindus in Pakistan, Hindustan kept the remaining Muslims in India with its chest
 aaj ayodhya main ram mandir nirmaan ke liye bharat ke musalamaanon ko aage aana hoga
 The Union Minister said that today Muslims have increased from 3 to 33 percent in India, yet the temple of Hindus has not been able to build a temple in Ayodhya, Mathura, Kashi even after 72 years of India's independence
 is desh kaa yah durbhaagya hi he jahaan 100 karod hindu kii aabaadi vaale desh main ek mandir banane ke liye netaaon or nyaayalay kaa munh dekhnaa pad rahaa he
 Even if the temple is not built in Ayodhya, the patience of 100 crore Hindus will break and if it happens, it will be very bad for the country

 The Nehru Gandhi family is completely responsible for the situation that the country is going through today
 giriraaj singh aage kaha ki agar desh ke pehle pradhanmantri sardaar patel hote hai to aaj desh kii yah durdasha nahin hoti
 In the time of Sardar Patel, as the temple of Somnath was built, the temple would have been built in Kashi, Mathura and Ayodhya today
 aaj desh main dharm kii aad main raajnneeti karne vaale logon ko raajnneeti karne kaa mauka nahin miltaa
 This is the plight of the country today due to Nehru's wrong policies
 unhone kaha ki musalmaan bhaaiyon ko hi aage aana hoga
 If he does not come forward to build a temple in Ayodhya, then the patience of the Hindus will be broken and if this happens, the outcome will not be good for the country

 wo log samaaj main khai bana rahe hai
 "giriraj Singh says that when the court has said that they should settle the matter together, then some one will mediate
 shri shri ravishankar aaj kii taarikh main ek saanskrithik yoga guru or aadhyatmik guru ke rup main hai
 i am confident that Sri Sri Ravi Shankar will mediate right

 He said, "there is no limit to terrorism
 aatankwaad ek vikruti he jo kalpana se pare he
 The Prime Minister regretted that many countries of the world could never understand the abominable form of terrorism

 He said that but later when i came here, he was explaining to me what terrorism is because then there was a 9-11 incident here, that is, we do not understand terrorism until the bomb falls

 Actress Priyanka Chopra, one of the two actress Baji Rao Mastani, believes that there is no need to promote a film like Baji Rao Mastani
 pichley ek maheene se 'baaji raav mastaani' kaa prachaar chal rahaa he jisamen deepika padukon or ranvir singh jute hue the
 On the other hand, Priyanka Gandhi was busy doing international TV show Quantico
 ab priyanka bhi film ko pramot karne maidan main utar chuki hai
 For the first time, when Priyanka appeared in front of the media, she looked confident
 priyanka chopra se jab poocha gaya ki ab vah prachaar se kis tarah judengi kyonki 18 disambar ko box offis par shahrukh khan kii film 'dilavaale' baaji raav mastaani' ke saamne hogi, to priyanka ne kaha, baaji raav mastaani or dilavaale alag alag filmein hai
 Both of them are different and both have different directors who are known for making different kinds of films

 Let me tell you that all are full of enthusiasm and confidence about this film

 udhar priyanka gandhi international tivi sho quontico karne men vyast thim
 Now Priyanka has also entered the field to promote the film
 pehali baar jab media ke saamne priyanka padin to vah aatmavishvaas se bhari nazar ain
 When Priyanka Chopra was asked how she would now engage in publicity because Shah Rukh Khan's film 'dilwale' will be opposite Baji Rao Mastani at the box office on December 18, Priyanka said, Baji Rao Mastani and Dilwale are different films
 
 donon kaa jonnor alag he or donon ke nirdeshak alag hai jo alag alag tarah kii filmein banane ke liye jane jate hai
 So there is no comparison between the two films "comments priyanka ne aage jodate hue kaha, lekin jab product baaji raav mastaani jaisaa ho to ise kisi kii zarurat nahin he
 Priyanka Chopra is playing Baji Rao's first wife Kashi Bai in the film 'baji Rao Mastani'
 aapako bataa den ki is film ko lekar sabhi utsaah or aatmavishvaas se bhare hue hai
 However, everyone is saying that with the coming of 2 big films, both will suffer
 priyanka chopra se jab poocha gaya ki ab vah prachaar se kis tarah judengi kyonki 18 disambar ko box offis par shahrukh khan kii film 'dilavaale' baaji raav mastaani' ke saamne hogi, to priyanka ne kaha, baaji raav mastaani or dilavaale alag alag filmein hai

 Mahant Nritya performed abusive remarks on Gopal Das police aksar insaanon ke saath hui chori, dakaiti, lut, maar-peet aadi ke maamle to darj karti he, lekin bihar ke vaishali jile main ek bada hi ajeebogareeb maamla saamne aayaa he
 In this case, the police is also in a state of misery
 darasal yahaan ek kute kii hatya ke maamle main police ne mukadmaa darj kiya he
 All were taken aback at the Sadar police station of Hajipur in Vaishali district when a woman named Chandra Devi entered the police station for the body of a dog
 thane pahunchate hi chandradevi duty par tainaat adhikari se kute kii maut kaa maamla darj karne kii maang karti he
 At first glance, the police officers present there are surprised at his demand
 chandradevi police ko bataati he ki yah unka paaltu kutta tha
 a person named Indradev Rai is responsible for the death of the dog
 chandradevi apane padosi indradev raay ke khilaaf maamla darj karwaanaa chaahati thi
 After his lakhs of pleas, the police finally register the dog killing Kamala and start an investigation

 Chandradevi told the police that his pet dog was fed by his neighbor Indradev Rai with a poisonous substance in the food, which led to his death
 esake mishra ne aage bataaya ki maamla darj hote hi police isaki jaanch main juty he
 At the same time, the body of the dog has been sent to the veterinary hospital for post-mortem

 bijepi saansad or purv grih sachiv aarake singh ne shuukravaar ko party or sarkaar ko us samay asahaj sthiti main daal diya, jab shunya kaal ke dauraan vah jammu-kashmir par bol rahe the
 Singh, in the meantime, questioned the policy of his own government and said that action was not being taken against the anti-national forces, whereas earlier action was taken against such forces
 loksabhaa main shunya kaal ke dauraan saansad aarake singh ne kashmir mudde par bolte hue sawaal kiya, 'kashmir main pakistani jhande laharaae ja rahe hai
 The situation there is not good
 rashtravirohi takatein aawaaj uthaa rahi hai
 But the Mehbooba government is not taking any action against them
 ' aarake singh kaa kahana tha ki agar rajya sarkaar kuch nahin kar rahi he to centre ko kuch karnaa chahie
 'action should be taken against the responsible forces' The former Home Secretary further demanded from his own government that the Center take strict action against those forces responsible for the situation in Kashmir, so that the morale of such forces does not increase
 aarake singh kaa kahana tha ki pehle aisi ghatana kam hoti thi, kyonki tab unke khilaaf ection hota tha
 Therefore at that time such incidents were also less
 haalanki yah pehla mauka nahin he, jab aarake singh ne apni hi sarkaar par sawaal uthaaya ho
 Even before this, he has targeted his own party and government many times
 bihar main sharabbandi par koi samjhauta nahin hoga
 This is to say of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, who was addressing a workshop related to Neera and other materials from palm tree on Saturday
 nitish ne gopalganj main haal hi main jahrili sharaab pine se 18 logon kii maut par bhi kaha ki ye tark galat he ki bihar main sharaab par pabandi lagane ke kaaran ye sab ho rahaa he, kyonki jab bihar main desi or videshi sharaab kii bikri par pratibandh nahin tha, tab bhi aisi ghatana hoti thi or uttar pradesh main pichley maheene jahrili sharaab pine se kai logon kii maut hui thi
 But Nitish claimed that the ongoing campaign against him on this issue is not going to affect him
 tippaniyan Referring to the management of the new excise bill passed by both houses of Bihar Legislature last month, Nitish said that those who are drinking, keep on criticizing them by finding some excuse, but the smile back on the face of the people of the village Has come, we cannot finish it
 filhal is nae utpaada bill ko rajyapal ne apni sahmati nahin di he
 After the liquor carnage in Gopalganj, the local administration has seized the palm trees and has put homeguard jawans under surveillance of those seized trees
 nitish ne shanivaar ko sharabbandi lagane kii prerana yaa sharaab ke prati unki dharna kyon badali, uske bare main charchaa karte hue kaha ki jab wo patna ke ejineering college main chaatr the tab shahar ke musallahpur ilaake main ek krishna loj main rahaa karte the
 In the first week of every month, after drinking liquor in the surrounding area, people used to make so much ruckus and street hawks that they hated alcohol
 lekin sharaab ko ghar ghar tak pahunchane ke liye apni aalochana par bolte hue nitish ne kaha ki unki sarkaar jab aayi tab sharaab kii puri kharid bikri ko vyavasthti kiya gaya jisase rajasav main itani vruddhi aayi
 Nitish also said on the recent death of 18 people by drinking poisonous liquor in Gopalganj, that the argument is wrong that all this is happening due to the ban on liquor in Bihar, because when the ban on sale of domestic and foreign liquor in Bihar is banned
 There was no such incident even then and in Uttar Pradesh last month many people died due to drinking poisonous liquor
 lekin nitish ne daawa kiya ki is mudde par unke khilaaf chal rahe abhiyaan se unke upar koi asar nahin hone vaala he
 The comments pichley maheene bihar vidhaan mandal ke donon sadanon se paarit nae utpaada bill ke prabandhan kii charchaa karte hue nitish ne kaha ki jo pine pilaane vaale hai wo koi na koi bahaanaa dhundhakar unki aalochana karte rahete hai, lekin gaanv ke logon ke chehre par jo muskuraahat waapas ai he, use khatm nahin kar sakate hai
 The Governor has not given his consent to this new excise bill at present
 gopalganj main sharaab cond ke baad sthaneey prashasan ne tad ke pedo ko jabt kiya he or un jabt pedo kii nigaraanee main homeguard ke jawan lagaae hai
 Nitish, while discussing about the motivation for prohibiting liquor or his perception of alcohol changed on Saturday, said that when he was a student at Patna's engineering college, he used to live in a Krishna lodge in Mussallapur area of the city
 vahaan har maheene ke pehle hafte main aas paas ke ilaake main sharaab pine ke baad log itnaa hangaamaa or gali galouj karte the ki unako sharaab ke prati nafrat ho gai
 But speaking on his criticism for bringing liquor from door to door, Nitish said that when his government came, the entire purchase and sale of liquor was arranged which increased the revenue so much

 Senior Uttar Pradesh minister Azam Khan, who has been in controversy for his statements, has now given a controversial statement about the rape victim, which is getting a lot of criticism
 ajam khan ne manch se hi peedita ko kaha, 'badanaami kii shikaayat se use shoharat to mil jaaegi lekin vah duniya ko kya munh dikhaaegi
 'azam arrived in Khankanpur to attend an event
 isi dauraan rape peedita unase milane kii koshish kar rahi thi jisase thodi avyavashtha fail gai
 Taking a dig at the victim from the stage, Azam said, "I don't know the case of this sister, it will be a serious matter, but the uproar she has made has brought her fame
 If she will bring fame from infamy then how will she show her face?" 'darasal,rape peedit mahilaek mahila vakil ke saath yahaan ai thi or ajam khan se milakar apni shikaayat karnaa chaahati thi lekin kaarykram ke aayojakon ne use roak liya
 On this, there was some ruckus in the program
 is baat se khize hue ajam ne manch se hi peedit mahila par nishaanaa saadhaa
 He said that the sisters who have spread chaos have definitely got fame from here
 yahi nahin ajam ne ye bhi kaha ki unki jo shikaayat he wo badanaami kii shikaayat he
 If she will bring this notoriety so much, then how will she show the face of the era? After Azam Khan's comment, the resentment of the rape victim increased
 peedit mahila kaa kahana he ajam khan ne unke liye apshabd kahe hai or ab wo ajam khan se kabhi nahin milengi
 The rape victim told that when she was going somewhere with her husband, the miscreants showed her a knife and forced her into the car and raped her and then escaped leaving the vegetable market
 peedita ne bataaya ki police ne is maamle main sirf chhedchhad kaa cese darj kiya he
 She approached Azam Khan, pleading for action against the culprits
 dekha jaae to desh ke siyaasi patal par 2018 main sabase zyada ubhaar congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ke raajnneetik kariyar main aayaa he
 Rahul Gandhi had many successes in 2018, after losing one successive election after another
 modi ke home pich gujarat main kadi chunauti or uske baad karnataka kaa siyaasi daanv or saal ke ant aate-aate uttar bharat ke teen bade rajya madhya pradesh, chhattisgarh or rajasthan main congress kii tajposhi se party samarthakon main ek ummid jagaai he
 But now the year is new and the challenges are bigger than that
 saal ke aagaaj ke saath hi 2019 kii ranbhumi saj chuki he, jahaan sidhe muqabla modi banaam rahul he
 The largest political Junk Congress party will enter the political battle of the Lok Sabha elections under the leadership of Rahul Gandhi for the first time
 rahul gandhi ke liye 2019 thik vaisaa hi nirnaayak saal sabit hone vaala he, jaisaa ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ke liye
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the Modi wave Congress has been completely wiped out
 congress itane bhi saansad nahin jeet pai thi ki vah pratipaksh kii kursi bhi paa sake
 For almost three decades, the Congress party has been fighting a particular kind of politics of the BJP
 haalanki congress is dauraan kai baar satta main rahi, lekin sabase ahm baat yah he ki vah ek baar apane dam par sarkaar nahin bana saki
 After Modi came to power, successive states have slipped
 1990 ke ram mandir andolan se lekar 2014 kii modi lahar or uske baad 2019 tak congress ko bijepi se hi takkar leni he
 However, after Rahul Gandhi took over the reins of the party, he has adopted the path of soft Hindutva
 baavjood iske 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main congress kii vaapasi kaa sara daaromadar rahul ke kandhon par hai
 The challenge of uniting the opposition is the biggest challenge for Congress President Rahul Gandhi to keep the opposition united
 haal hi main rahul ke netritv main congress ko teen rajyon main jeet bhi mili he, jisase unke hausale jarur buland honge
 But beating the BJP in 2019 is not so easy
 yahi vajah he ki rahul vipakshi ekta kii baat lagaataar kar rahe hai, lekin basapa, sapa tiemasi jaise dal ab bhi unke saath aane ko taiyaar nahin dikh rahe hai
 Apart from this, KCR is engaged in forming a coalition of non-congress and non-bjp parties
 in sabake bich rahul ke liye sabase badi chunauti vipaksh ko apane naam par saath laane kii he
 However, Rahul Gandhi has said openly that he is ready to become Prime Minister
 lekin mahagathbandhan main unke naam par bhi sabaki sahmati nahin he
 In such a situation, his dream of becoming PM can be fulfilled only when the Congress forms the government with an absolute majority or the Congress has so many seats that other opposition parties have no way but to support the Congress to form the government
 aise main 2019 main rahul kii siyasat kii asli pariksha hogi
 Not only will the Lok Sabha have to win the assembly elections, but not only the Lok Sabha elections in 2019, assembly elections are also going to be held in many important states
 is saal andhra pradesh, haryana, jammu- kashmir, maharashtra, jharkhand, odisha, arunachal pradesh or sikkim main vidhansabha chunaav hone hai
 Maharashtra, Jharkhand and Haryana are such states
 2014 main narendra modi ke satta main aane ke baad in teenon rajyon ko congress ko karaari maat dekar bijepi ne jeet darj kii thi
 In such a situation, it is a challenge for Rahul to get these three states back
 congress maharashtra main ensipi ke saath or jharkhand main jharkhand mukti morcha ke saath gathbandhan karke chunavi maidan ko fatah karnaa chaahati he
 At the same time, in Haryana, the Congress is struggling to fight the BJP on its own

 Rahul Gandhi's slippery tongue during campaigning in Madhya Pradesh elections seems to be causing trouble to him
 rajya ke mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ke bete kartikeya chouhan ne bhopal kii ek adaalat main rahul gandhi ke khilaaf manahani kaa daawa kar diya he
 There have been many such incidents this month, suggesting that Rahul Gandhi has been making many mistakes one after the other
 haalanki mukademe kaa saamana unhen abhi karnaa padaa he
 In fact, at a rally in Jhabua on Monday, Rahul Gandhi was accusing BJP leaders of corruption one after another
 rafaal ke alaava neerav modi, vijay maalya jaise muddon ko unhone uthaaya
 During this time, he said that the name of Kartikeya Chauhan, son of Shivraj Singh Chauhan, has come in the Panama scam
 rahul ke is bayaan ke baad hangaamaa much gaya
 Soon after, Shivraj Singh Chauhan said on the tweet that pichley kai varshon se congress mere or mere parivaar ke upar anargal aarope laga rahi hai
 We respect everyone and have dignity, but today @rahulgandhi ji has crossed the limits of my son @yuva_kartikey's name in the Panama Papers! Only yesterday we are claiming defamation on them
 — shivrajsingh Chouhan (@chouhanshivraj) October 29, 2018 Rahul Gandhi was in Indore on Tuesday morning
 unhone ek hotel main patrakaron se mulaakaat kii
 In this, he was asked about his statement and reminded that the name of Shivraj Singh Chauhan's son is not in the Panama papers
 iske baad rahul gandhi ne mana ki unase gadabadi ho gai
 googletag
 cmd
 push (function () {googletag
 display('adslotnativevideo'); }); But neither Shivraj Singh Chauhan nor his son Karthikeya are satisfied with this cleanliness
 kartikeya ne manahani kaa daawa kar diya
 His lawyer has cited newspaper cutting and TV news clipping as evidence
 3 november ko is maamle kii sunwaayee hogi
 Karthikeya said that it is okay that Rahul Gandhi gave clarification
 lekin unhone saarvajanik manch se unke or unke parivaar ke bare main galat baaten kahin
 It is therefore claimed
 idhar, shivaraj singh chouhan rajya vidhansabha main tikaton ke bantwaare par charchaa ke liye dilli pahunch gaye hai
 Here he met Amit Shah
 saath hi kaha ki rahul gandhi ne unka apmaan kiya he
 On the other hand, Rahul Gandhi's attacks on Shivraj Singh Chauhan are continuing
 unhone aaj madhya pradesh main kaha ki jitne mukademe karnaa hai kar len, vyapam ghotaale se dhyaan nahin bhatka sakate
 But this story of Rahul Gandhi's tongue slipping has definitely come up for discussion
 aisa isliye bhi he kyonki isi maheene ek ke baad ek aisi kai ghatnaayen hui hai
 One such incident happened on Monday when Rahul Gandhi wrote Mizoram to Manipur in his Facebook post
 iske baad unki jabardast aalochana hui
 This is also a problem for the Congress because elections are still going on in Mizoram and there is a Congress government there
 darasal, rahul gandhi ne mizoram ke us sainik skool ke bare main story saajha kii thi jisane pachaas saal baad apane daravaaje ladakiyon ke liye khole hai
 But accidentally wrote Manipur instead of Mizoram
 baad main us post ko hataa diya gaya
 Correct information was added to the new post
 rahul kii galatiyon kaa silsilaa yaheen nahin thama
 He alleged at an election meeting in Madhya Pradesh this month that Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had met Nirav Modi in Parliament
 iske baad neerav modi desh chhod kar bhaag gaya
 But Rahul also made a mistake here
 neerav modi na to kabhi sansad aayaa or na hi kabhi arun jetali se uski mulaakaat hui
 Rahul might have wanted to mention Vijay Mallya
 jiske bare main vitt mantri ne kaha tha ki usne apane saansad hone kaa durupyog karte hue sansad bhawan main unase milane kii koshish kii thi lekin unhone usko jhaad diya tha
 On Rahul's latest allegation, Jaitley wrote on Facebook that "I do not remember if i ever saw Nirav Modi
" sansad bhawan main usase milane kaa to sawaal hi nahin uthta
 Like Rahul is claiming that if Nirav Modi comes to Parliament, it will be mentioned in the reception record of Parliament House
 kya rahul yah maanate hai ki agar ek jhooth baar-baar bolaa jaye to khud ko uske sach hone kaa yakeen ho jaataa he
 Or is it a case of a clown prince
 rahul gandhi ne is aarope par safai nahin di he
 Another issue of Rahul Gandhi's mess is the one rank one pension for army officers and jawans
 2014 main bijepi ke ghoshnaptr main oropi kaa vaada karne kaa rahul gandhi ne zikr kiya tha
 On 19 April 2014, a tweet from the Congress party said that in the manifesto, he (BJP) has written, We will do one rank one pension
 oropi ho gaya he, hamane kar diya he: rahul gandhi
 But this Saturday, Rahul Gandhi met a delegation of ex-servicemen
 isamen unhone unhen kaha ki congress kii aguwai vaali sarkaar van rank van pension ke mudde par sabhi vaadon ko puraa karegi
 It is necessary to state here that only Rahul Gandhi does not commit such messes
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ke kai bhaashanon main bhi aitihaasik or tathyaatmak galtiyaan darj kii gai hai jinke bare main samay samay par likhaa gaya he
 PM Modi's speeches also happened many times when his tongue slipped
 aisi hi galatiyon par ek nazar daal lete hai- Before becoming PM, he said that in 1947 one rupee was worth one dollar
 jabaki hakeekat yah he ki tab rupee kii tulana pound se hoti thi or ek rupye kaa mulya tees saint tha
 - He once mistakenly called Mahatma Gandhi as Mohanlal Karamchand Gandhi instead of Mohandas
 - unke munh se laal kile kii jagah laal darwaja nikal gaya tha
 He had said that PM gives speeches through the red door on 15 August
 - prachaar ke dauraan unhone kah diya tha ki ye 14veen loksabhaa ke chunaav hai
 Then when someone interrupted, he said that there are elections to the 16th Lok Sabha
 - unhone kaha jab ham gupt vansh kii baat karte hai to chandragupta kii raajnneeti kii yaad aati he
 But Chandragupta belonged to the Maurya dynasty
 haa chandragupta dwitiya gupt vansh main jarur hue the
 - In the place of freedom fighter Shyamji Krishna Verma, PM Modi was sitting referring to Shyama Prasad Mukherjee
 - daos main unhone kah diya tha ki chah sau karod bharatiyon ne ek party kii sarkaar ko chunaa
 So these are mistakes that often occur during election campaigning
 madhya pradesh kii hi baat karen to abhi congress ke do netaaon ke bhaashanon main hui galatiyon ne surkhiyaan batori hai
 One speech is by Congress MP Kantilal Bhuria
 bhuriyaji rahul gandhi or rajeev gandhi main gadabadi kar baithe
 Well, when he was interrupted he also cured himself
 aise hi ek duusare netaa jitu patawaari bhi surkhiyaan bator chuke hai jab unhone kaha tha party gai tel lene
 But due to his slippery tongue, Rahul Gandhi has got caught in the legal bet

 pichley kai varshon se congress mere or mere parivaar ke upar anargal aarope laga rahi hai
 We respect everyone and have dignity, but today @rahulgandhi ji has crossed the limits of my son @yuva_kartikey's name in the Panama Papers! Only yesterday we are claiming defamation on them
 lekin na to shivaraj singh chouhan or na hi unke bete kartikeya is safai se santusht hai
 Karthikeya claimed defamation
 unke vakil ne saboot ke taur par akhabaaron kii kating or tivi news kii cliping kaa hawala diya he
 The case will be heard on November 3
 kartikeya ne kaha ki yah thik he ki rahul gandhi ne safai di
 But he told wrong things about him and his family from a public forum
 isliye daawa kiya he
 Here, Shivraj Singh Chauhan has reached Delhi to discuss the distribution of tickets in the state assembly
 yahaan unhone amit shah se mulaakaat kii
 He also said that Rahul Gandhi has insulted him
 udhar, rahul gandhi ke shivaraj singh chouhan par hamale jari hai
 He said in Madhya Pradesh today that as many prosecutions have to be done, one cannot divert attention from the Vyapam scam
 lekin rahul gandhi kii jubaan phisalane kaa yah kissa charchaa main jarur aa gaya he
 This is also because many such incidents have happened one after another in the same month
 aisa hi ek vakya somvaar ko hi hua jab rahul gandhi ne apane fasebuk post main mizoram ko manipur likh daalaa
 After this he received a lot of criticism
 yah congress ke liye pareshaani main daalane vaali baat bhi he kyonki mizoram main bhi abhi chunaav ho rahaa he or vahaan congress kii sarkaar he
 In fact, Rahul Gandhi shared a story about the military school in Mizoram which has opened its doors to girls after fifty years
 lekin galati se mizoram kii jagah manipur likh daalaa
 That post was later deleted
 nai post main sahi jaankaree daali gai
 The process of Rahul's mistakes did not stop here
 unhone isi maheene madhya pradesh main chunavi sabha main aarope lagaaya ki vitt mantri arun jetali ne sansad main neerav modi se mulaakaat kii thi
 After this Nirav Modi left the country and fled
 lekin rahul yahaan bhi galati kar baithe
 Nirav Modi neither came to Parliament nor did he ever meet Arun Jaitley
 rahul shaayad vijay maalya kaa zikr karnaa chaah rahe honge
 About which the Finance Minister said that he had tried to meet her in the Parliament House, abusing his MP, but he had defeated him
 rahul ke tazaa aarope ke bare main jetali ne fasebuk par likhaa ki 'mujhe nahin yaad he ki maine kabhi neerav modi ko dekha bhi ho
 There is no question of meeting him in the Parliament House
 rahul jaisaa daawa kar rahe hai ki neerav modi sansad main aae to sansad bhawan ke resepshan ke record main iskaa zikr hoga
 Does Rahul believe that if a lie is told again and again, he believes himself to be true
 yaa phir yah maamla ek masakhre rajkumaar kii masakhri kaa he
 Rahul Gandhi has not given clarification on this allegation
 rahul gandhi kii gadabadi kaa ek or mudda sena afasaron or javaanon ke liye van rank van pension yani oropi kaa he
 In the 2014 BJP manifesto, Rahul Gandhi mentioned the promise of OROP
 19 april 2014 ko congress party ke ek twit main kaha gaya ki 'menifesto main unhone (bijepi ne) likhaa he, ham van rank van pension karenge
 OROP is done, we have done it: Rahul Gandhi
 ' lekin isi shanivaar ko purv sainikkarmiyon ke ek pratinidhimandal se rahul gandhi ne mulaakaat kii
 In this, he told them that the Congress-led government would fulfill all promises on the issue of One Rank One Pension
 yahaan yah bataanaa jaruri he ki sirf rahul gandhi hi aisi gadabadiyaan nahin karte hai
 Many speeches by Prime Minister Narendra Modi have also recorded historical and factual mistakes about which have been written from time to time
 piem modi ke bhaashanon main bhi kai baar aisa hua jab unki jubaan fisali
 Let's take a look at similar mistakes- - piem banane se pehle unhone kaha ki 1947 main ek rupaya ek dollar ke baraabar tha
 Whereas the reality is that then the rupee was compared to the pound and the value of one rupee was thirty cents
 - ek baar unhone galati se mahatma gandhi ko mohandas kii jagah mohanlal karamchand gandhi kah diya tha
 - Instead of the Red Fort, the Red Door had come out of their mouths
 unhone kaha tha ki piem 15 agast ko laal daravaaje se bhaashan dete hai
 During the campaign, he had said that these are the elections to the 14th Lok Sabha
 phir kisi ko tokane par unhone kaha ki 16veen loksabhaa ke chunaav hai
 - He said that when we talk of Gupta dynasty, we remember Chandragupta's politics
 lekin chandragupta maury vansh ke the
 Yes, Chandragupta II was definitely in the Gupta dynasty
 - swatantraaa senaanee shyaamaji krishna verma kii jagah piem modi shyama prasad mukherjee kaa zikr kar baithe the
 In Daos, he had said that 600 million Indians elected a party government
 to ye aisi galatiyaan hai jo aksar chunaav prachaar ke dauraan hoti hai
 Talking about Madhya Pradesh, the mistakes made in the speeches of two Congress leaders have made headlines
 ek bhaashan congress saansad kantilal bhuriya kaa he
 Bhuriyaji got into trouble with Rahul Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi
 khayr jab unhen tokaa gaya to unhone khud ko thik bhi kar liya
 Another such leader Jitu Patwari has also made headlines when he said that the party went to take oil
 lekin rahul gandhi apni fisali jubaan ke kaaran philhal to kanoonee daanvpench main ulajh gaye hai

 lekin unhone saarvajanik manch se unke or unke parivaar ke bare main galat baaten kahin
 It is therefore claimed
 idhar, shivaraj singh chouhan rajya vidhansabha main tikaton ke bantwaare par charchaa ke liye dilli pahunch gaye hai
 Here he met Amit Shah
 saath hi kaha ki rahul gandhi ne unka apmaan kiya he
 On the other hand, Rahul Gandhi's attacks on Shivraj Singh Chauhan are continuing
 unhone aaj madhya pradesh main kaha ki jitne mukademe karnaa hai kar len, vyapam ghotaale se dhyaan nahin bhatka sakate
 But this story of Rahul Gandhi's tongue slipping has definitely come up for discussion
 aisa isliye bhi he kyonki isi maheene ek ke baad ek aisi kai ghatnaayen hui hai
 One such incident happened on Monday when Rahul Gandhi wrote Mizoram to Manipur in his Facebook post
 iske baad unki jabardast aalochana hui
 This is also a problem for the Congress because elections are still going on in Mizoram and there is a Congress government there
 darasal, rahul gandhi ne mizoram ke us sainik skool ke bare main story saajha kii thi jisane pachaas saal baad apane daravaaje ladakiyon ke liye khole hai
 But accidentally wrote Manipur instead of Mizoram
 baad main us post ko hataa diya gaya
 Correct information was added to the new post
 rahul kii galatiyon kaa silsilaa yaheen nahin thama
 He alleged at an election meeting in Madhya Pradesh this month that Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had met Nirav Modi in Parliament
 iske baad neerav modi desh chhod kar bhaag gaya
 But Rahul also made a mistake here
 neerav modi na to kabhi sansad aayaa or na hi kabhi arun jetali se uski mulaakaat hui
 Rahul might have wanted to mention Vijay Mallya
 jiske bare main vitt mantri ne kaha tha ki usne apane saansad hone kaa durupyog karte hue sansad bhawan main unase milane kii koshish kii thi lekin unhone usko jhaad diya tha
 On Rahul's latest allegation, Jaitley wrote on Facebook that "I do not remember if i ever saw Nirav Modi
" sansad bhawan main usase milane kaa to sawaal hi nahin uthta
 Like Rahul is claiming that if Nirav Modi comes to Parliament, it will be mentioned in the reception record of Parliament House
 kya rahul yah maanate hai ki agar ek jhooth baar-baar bolaa jaye to khud ko uske sach hone kaa yakeen ho jaataa he
 Or is it a case of a clown prince
 rahul gandhi ne is aarope par safai nahin di he
 Another issue of Rahul Gandhi's mess is the one rank one pension for army officers and jawans
 2014 main bijepi ke ghoshnaptr main oropi kaa vaada karne kaa rahul gandhi ne zikr kiya tha
 On 19 April 2014, a tweet from the Congress party said that in the manifesto, he (BJP) has written, We will do one rank one pension
 oropi ho gaya he, hamane kar diya he: rahul gandhi
 But this Saturday, Rahul Gandhi met a delegation of ex-servicemen
 isamen unhone unhen kaha ki congress kii aguwai vaali sarkaar van rank van pension ke mudde par sabhi vaadon ko puraa karegi
 It is necessary to state here that only Rahul Gandhi does not commit such messes
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ke kai bhaashanon main bhi aitihaasik or tathyaatmak galtiyaan darj kii gai hai jinke bare main samay samay par likhaa gaya he
 PM Modi's speeches also happened many times when his tongue slipped
 aisi hi galatiyon par ek nazar daal lete hai- Before becoming PM, he said that in 1947 one rupee was worth one dollar
 jabaki hakeekat yah he ki tab rupee kii tulana pound se hoti thi or ek rupye kaa mulya tees saint tha
 - He once mistakenly called Mahatma Gandhi as Mohanlal Karamchand Gandhi instead of Mohandas
 - unke munh se laal kile kii jagah laal darwaja nikal gaya tha
 He had said that PM gives speeches through the red door on 15 August
 - prachaar ke dauraan unhone kah diya tha ki ye 14veen loksabhaa ke chunaav hai
 Then when someone interrupted, he said that there are elections to the 16th Lok Sabha
 - unhone kaha jab ham gupt vansh kii baat karte hai to chandragupta kii raajnneeti kii yaad aati he
 But Chandragupta belonged to the Maurya dynasty
 haa chandragupta dwitiya gupt vansh main jarur hue the
 - In the place of freedom fighter Shyamji Krishna Verma, PM Modi was sitting referring to Shyama Prasad Mukherjee
 - daos main unhone kah diya tha ki chah sau karod bharatiyon ne ek party kii sarkaar ko chunaa
 So these are mistakes that often occur during election campaigning
 madhya pradesh kii hi baat karen to abhi congress ke do netaaon ke bhaashanon main hui galatiyon ne surkhiyaan batori hai
 One speech is by Congress MP Kantilal Bhuria
 bhuriyaji rahul gandhi or rajeev gandhi main gadabadi kar baithe
 Well, when he was interrupted he also cured himself
 aise hi ek duusare netaa jitu patawaari bhi surkhiyaan bator chuke hai jab unhone kaha tha party gai tel lene
 But due to his slippery tongue, Rahul Gandhi has got caught in the legal bet

 One such incident happened on Monday when Rahul Gandhi wrote Mizoram to Manipur in his Facebook post
 iske baad unki jabardast aalochana hui
 This is also a problem for the Congress because elections are still going on in Mizoram and there is a Congress government there
 darasal, rahul gandhi ne mizoram ke us sainik skool ke bare main story saajha kii thi jisane pachaas saal baad apane daravaaje ladakiyon ke liye khole hai
 But accidentally wrote Manipur instead of Mizoram
 baad main us post ko hataa diya gaya
 Correct information was added to the new post
 rahul kii galatiyon kaa silsilaa yaheen nahin thama
 He alleged at an election meeting in Madhya Pradesh this month that Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had met Nirav Modi in Parliament
 iske baad neerav modi desh chhod kar bhaag gaya
 But Rahul also made a mistake here
 neerav modi na to kabhi sansad aayaa or na hi kabhi arun jetali se uski mulaakaat hui
 Rahul might have wanted to mention Vijay Mallya
 jiske bare main vitt mantri ne kaha tha ki usne apane saansad hone kaa durupyog karte hue sansad bhawan main unase milane kii koshish kii thi lekin unhone usko jhaad diya tha
 On Rahul's latest allegation, Jaitley wrote on Facebook that "I do not remember if i ever saw Nirav Modi
" sansad bhawan main usase milane kaa to sawaal hi nahin uthta
 Like Rahul is claiming that if Nirav Modi comes to Parliament, it will be mentioned in the reception record of Parliament House
 kya rahul yah maanate hai ki agar ek jhooth baar-baar bolaa jaye to khud ko uske sach hone kaa yakeen ho jaataa he
 Or is it a case of a clown prince
 rahul gandhi ne is aarope par safai nahin di he
 Another issue of Rahul Gandhi's mess is the one rank one pension for army officers and jawans
 2014 main bijepi ke ghoshnaptr main oropi kaa vaada karne kaa rahul gandhi ne zikr kiya tha
 On 19 April 2014, a tweet from the Congress party said that in the manifesto, he (BJP) has written, We will do one rank one pension
 oropi ho gaya he, hamane kar diya he: rahul gandhi
 But this Saturday, Rahul Gandhi met a delegation of ex-servicemen
 isamen unhone unhen kaha ki congress kii aguwai vaali sarkaar van rank van pension ke mudde par sabhi vaadon ko puraa karegi
 It is necessary to state here that only Rahul Gandhi does not commit such messes
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ke kai bhaashanon main bhi aitihaasik or tathyaatmak galtiyaan darj kii gai hai jinke bare main samay samay par likhaa gaya he
 PM Modi's speeches also happened many times when his tongue slipped
 aisi hi galatiyon par ek nazar daal lete hai- Before becoming PM, he said that in 1947 one rupee was worth one dollar
 jabaki hakeekat yah he ki tab rupee kii tulana pound se hoti thi or ek rupye kaa mulya tees saint tha
 - He once mistakenly called Mahatma Gandhi as Mohanlal Karamchand Gandhi instead of Mohandas
 - unke munh se laal kile kii jagah laal darwaja nikal gaya tha
 He had said that PM gives speeches through the red door on 15 August
 - prachaar ke dauraan unhone kah diya tha ki ye 14veen loksabhaa ke chunaav hai
 Then when someone interrupted, he said that there are elections to the 16th Lok Sabha
 - unhone kaha jab ham gupt vansh kii baat karte hai to chandragupta kii raajnneeti kii yaad aati he
 But Chandragupta belonged to the Maurya dynasty
 haa chandragupta dwitiya gupt vansh main jarur hue the
 - In the place of freedom fighter Shyamji Krishna Verma, PM Modi was sitting referring to Shyama Prasad Mukherjee
 - daos main unhone kah diya tha ki chah sau karod bharatiyon ne ek party kii sarkaar ko chunaa
 So these are mistakes that often occur during election campaigning
 madhya pradesh kii hi baat karen to abhi congress ke do netaaon ke bhaashanon main hui galatiyon ne surkhiyaan batori hai
 One speech is by Congress MP Kantilal Bhuria
 bhuriyaji rahul gandhi or rajeev gandhi main gadabadi kar baithe
 Well, when he was interrupted he also cured himself
 aise hi ek duusare netaa jitu patawaari bhi surkhiyaan bator chuke hai jab unhone kaha tha party gai tel lene
 But due to his slippery tongue, Rahul Gandhi has got caught in the legal bet

 udhar, rahul gandhi ke shivaraj singh chouhan par hamale jari hai
 He said in Madhya Pradesh today that as many prosecutions have to be done, one cannot divert attention from the Vyapam scam
 lekin rahul gandhi kii jubaan phisalane kaa yah kissa charchaa main jarur aa gaya he
 This is also because many such incidents have happened one after another in the same month
 aisa hi ek vakya somvaar ko hi hua jab rahul gandhi ne apane fasebuk post main mizoram ko manipur likh daalaa
 After this he received a lot of criticism
 yah congress ke liye pareshaani main daalane vaali baat bhi he kyonki mizoram main bhi abhi chunaav ho rahaa he or vahaan congress kii sarkaar he
 In fact, Rahul Gandhi shared a story about the military school in Mizoram which has opened its doors to girls after fifty years
 lekin galati se mizoram kii jagah manipur likh daalaa
 That post was later deleted
 nai post main sahi jaankaree daali gai
 The process of Rahul's mistakes did not stop here
 unhone isi maheene madhya pradesh main chunavi sabha main aarope lagaaya ki vitt mantri arun jetali ne sansad main neerav modi se mulaakaat kii thi
 After this Nirav Modi left the country and fled
 lekin rahul yahaan bhi galati kar baithe
 Nirav Modi neither came to Parliament nor did he ever meet Arun Jaitley
 rahul shaayad vijay maalya kaa zikr karnaa chaah rahe honge
 About which the Finance Minister said that he had tried to meet her in the Parliament House, abusing his MP, but he had defeated him
 rahul ke tazaa aarope ke bare main jetali ne fasebuk par likhaa ki 'mujhe nahin yaad he ki maine kabhi neerav modi ko dekha bhi ho
 There is no question of meeting him in the Parliament House
 rahul jaisaa daawa kar rahe hai ki neerav modi sansad main aae to sansad bhawan ke resepshan ke record main iskaa zikr hoga
 Does Rahul believe that if a lie is told again and again, he believes himself to be true
 yaa phir yah maamla ek masakhre rajkumaar kii masakhri kaa he
 Rahul Gandhi has not given clarification on this allegation
 rahul gandhi kii gadabadi kaa ek or mudda sena afasaron or javaanon ke liye van rank van pension yani oropi kaa he
 In the 2014 BJP manifesto, Rahul Gandhi mentioned the promise of OROP
 19 april 2014 ko congress party ke ek twit main kaha gaya ki 'menifesto main unhone (bijepi ne) likhaa he, ham van rank van pension karenge
 OROP is done, we have done it: Rahul Gandhi
 ' lekin isi shanivaar ko purv sainikkarmiyon ke ek pratinidhimandal se rahul gandhi ne mulaakaat kii
 In this, he told them that the Congress-led government would fulfill all promises on the issue of One Rank One Pension
 yahaan yah bataanaa jaruri he ki sirf rahul gandhi hi aisi gadabadiyaan nahin karte hai
 Many speeches by Prime Minister Narendra Modi have also recorded historical and factual mistakes about which have been written from time to time
 piem modi ke bhaashanon main bhi kai baar aisa hua jab unki jubaan fisali
 Let's take a look at similar mistakes- - piem banane se pehle unhone kaha ki 1947 main ek rupaya ek dollar ke baraabar tha
 Whereas the reality is that then the rupee was compared to the pound and the value of one rupee was thirty cents
 - ek baar unhone galati se mahatma gandhi ko mohandas kii jagah mohanlal karamchand gandhi kah diya tha
 - Instead of the Red Fort, the Red Door had come out of their mouths
 unhone kaha tha ki piem 15 agast ko laal daravaaje se bhaashan dete hai
 During the campaign, he had said that these are the elections to the 14th Lok Sabha
 phir kisi ko tokane par unhone kaha ki 16veen loksabhaa ke chunaav hai
 - He said that when we talk of Gupta dynasty, we remember Chandragupta's politics
 lekin chandragupta maury vansh ke the
 Yes, Chandragupta II was definitely in the Gupta dynasty
 - swatantraaa senaanee shyaamaji krishna verma kii jagah piem modi shyama prasad mukherjee kaa zikr kar baithe the
 In Daos, he had said that 600 million Indians elected a party government
 to ye aisi galatiyaan hai jo aksar chunaav prachaar ke dauraan hoti hai
 Talking about Madhya Pradesh, the mistakes made in the speeches of two Congress leaders have made headlines
 ek bhaashan congress saansad kantilal bhuriya kaa he
 Bhuriyaji got into trouble with Rahul Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi
 khayr jab unhen tokaa gaya to unhone khud ko thik bhi kar liya
 Another such leader Jitu Patwari has also made headlines when he said that the party went to take oil
 lekin rahul gandhi apni fisali jubaan ke kaaran philhal to kanoonee daanvpench main ulajh gaye hai

You are not, i am alone, but you are you in the swing of a swinging sword Or in the cheering of the crowd, Or in the lonely cry of death, And i miss the shield, The armor is broken, i remember craving what is lost - Directions, Identification, Coil, Armor But i am still, i am in battle, your i am your own!

 in vidhayakon kaa maananaa he ki shashikala or panniraselvam donon bahumat sabit nahin kar paaenge isliye diemke ke paas sambhaavnaaen talaashi jaae
 However, sources are suggesting that Stalin is not in favor of forming the DMK government as this would lead the DMK to be held responsible for the AIADMK breakdown

 Did the Sasikala group target the Congress? The reactions of other parties are also coming out
 congress ne saaf kiya he ki vah diemke ke saath he or shashikala ko samarthan dene kaa koi sawaal nahin he
 It is also being speculated whether the Sasikala faction had approached the Congress for support
 jabaki shashikala gut kaa daawa he ki 130 se adhik vidhayak uske saath he

 a group of more than 40 US lawmakers has appealed to the International Basketball Federation to end a 'clichéd and discriminatory' policy against Sikh players over turban
 saansadon ne antarrashtriya basketbaal mahasang (fiba) ke adhyaksh horsiyo muratori ko patr main likhaa, ‘‘sikh duniya bhar main kai khelon main hissaa lete hai or ek bhi aisi ghatana nahin he jisamen pagadi ke kaaran kisi ko chot lagi ho yaa nuksaan pahunchaa ho yaa pagadi ne khel main rukawat daali ho
 More than 40 mps signed the letter sent yesterday, led by MP Joe Crowley and Indian-origin Amy Berra
 yah patr antarrashtriya mahasang ke sambhavit faisle se pehle likhaa gaya he
 Crawley and Amy said in a joint statement, "each day Fiba is postponing the decision that Sikhs cannot play
" ’’ Crawley and Amy said, "this is a policy that can be described as grossly discriminatory, totally discriminatory and contrary to the spirit of team sports, and the time for change is long past
" isliye ham karrwai ke liye jor de rahe hai jisamen hamaara naveenatam patr bhi shaamil he or ham un sabhi ko dhanyavad dena chaahate hai jinhone apni aawaaj uthaai
 Our message to Fiba is clear, let them play
 ’’tippaniyan This discriminatory policy of Fiba came to light in 2014 when two Sikh players were told by referees that they would have to remove their turban if they wanted to play in Fiba's Asia Cup
 (is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he
 It is published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) "sikhs take part in many sports across the world and there is not a single incident in which someone is hurt or damaged due to a turban," the mps wrote in a letter to International Basketball Federation (fiba) President Horacio Muratori
 The turban may have hindered the game
 ’’ saansad jo krali or bhartiya mul kii emi bera kii aguai main kal bheje gaye is patr main 40 se adhik saansadon ne hastakshar kiye hai
 This letter has been written before the possible decision of the International Federation
 krali or emi ne sanyukt bayaan main kaha, ‘‘prayek din fiba is par faisle ko agle din ke liye taal rahaa he ki sikh nahin khel sakate

 BJP leader Nalin Kohli said that those who are questioning Prime Minister Narendra Modi regarding the assassination of Gauri Lankesh should ask questions to the Karnataka government, Karnataka police and Congress
 bijepi netaa ne kaha, 'mujhe lagata he kiunhen yah bakhubi pataa he ki karnataka sarkaar or congress se sawaal poochne par wo hilite nahin honge
 He will be more highlighted by asking questions to Prime Minister Modi
 ''raajnneeti kerani he to khulkar raajnneeti karen'nalin ne kaha ki upi ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath par jo bayaan unhone diya he
 It seems to him that he wants to do politics
 agar unhen raajnneeti kerani hai, to phir aword kaa sahaara lekar kyun raajnneeti kar rahe hai
 He is insulting the award by returning the award
 ye thik nahin he
 If they have to do politics, then openly do politics
 aword kii aad main raajnneeti karnaa galat he

 The grandfather of UP Bahubali leader Mukhtar Ansari was the President of the Indian National Congress before independence
 naanaa mahavir chakra vijeta to chachaa desh ke up-raashtrapati rahe
 Mukhtar Ansari, MLA from Mau for the last five times, has a proud history
 magar khud mukhtaar jurm ke raste par chal padaa
 He has been in jail for the last 13 years, taking over 40 cases on his head
 jitne mukademe hai utane hi dushman bhi
 The story of Mau of UP over 40 serious cases against Mukhtar is also very strange
 beete 5 baar se jo unka vidhayak he
 He is in jail for the last 13 years
 murder, kidnaping or ekstorshan jaisi darjanon sangeen vaardaaton ke aarope main mukhataar ansaari ke khilaaf 40 se zyaada mukademen darj hai
 Yet the bullying is so much that even while in jail, they not only win elections but also run their gangs
 2005 menmukhtaar ansariper mau main hinsa bhadakaane ke aarope lage
 Along with this, Ansari was accused of murdering BJP leader Krishnanand Rai along with his 7 colleagues while in jail
 purvanchal main kaayam he dabadabaamau main danga bhadakaane ke maamle main mukhtaar ne gajipur police ke saamne sarender kiya tha
 And since then he is in jail
 pehle unhen gajipur jail main rakhaa gaya
 Then he was sent to Mathura jail
 phir mathura se agra jail or agra se banda jail bhej diya gaya
 Since then, Mukhtar has not had any luck coming out
 lekin phir bhi purvanchal main unka dabadabaa kaayam he
 He continued to win elections even while in jail
 garibon ke liye robinhoodthekedaari, khanan, scrap, sharaab, railway thekedaari main ansaari kaa kabza he
 Due to which he raised his sultanate
 magar ye robinhood agar amiron se luutata he, to garibon main baantta bhi he
 Such people of Mau say that not only bullying but Mukhtar Ansari as MLA has done a lot of work in his area
 sadakon, pulon, aspataalon or skool-collejon par ye robinhood apni vidhayak nidhi se 20 guna zyaada paisa kharch karata he
 The glorious history of the family is not only due to fear but also due to work, Mukhtar Ansari's family is respected among the poor gurus of the area
 magar aap main se shaayad kam logon ko hi pataa ho ki mau main ansaari parivaar kii is izzat kii ek vajah or he or wo he is khandaan kaa gauravshaalee itihaas
 The date of dynastic influence of this family is hardly of any family of Purvanchal
 bahubali mukhtaar ansaari ke dada dow mukhtaar ahamed ansaari swatantraaa sangram andolan ke dauraan 1926-27 main indian neshnal congress ke adhyaksh rahe or ve gandhi ji ke behad kareebi maane jate the
 a road in Delhi is named after him in his memory
 naanaa the navshera yuddh ke naikamukhtaar ansaari ke dada kii tarah naanaa bhi namchin hastiyon main se ek the
 Perhaps few people know that Mahavir Chakra winner was Brigadier Usman Mukhtar Ansari's maternal grandfather
 jinhone 47 kii jang main na sirf bhartiya sena kii taraf se navshera kii ladaai ladi balki hindustan ko jeet bhi dilaai
 Although he himself was martyred for India in this war
 pita the bade netaa to chachaa rahe uparashtrapatikhandaan kii isiviraasatko mukhtaar ke pita subhanullah ansaari ne aage badhaayaa
 Apart from being a communist leader, Subhanullah Ansari was elected unopposed in the 1971 municipal election due to his clean image
 itnaa hi nahin bharat ke pichley uparashtrapati hamid ansaari bhi mukhtaar ke rishte main chachaa lagate hai
 Son Abbas did the name of the country, on one side, where there is a dynastic legacy of years, on the other hand, there is a mafia don Mukhtar Ansari surrounded by many serious charges
 jinhone is shandaar viraasat par paband lagaaya he
 But it will be surprising if i meet the next generation of this family
 mukhtaar ansaari ke bete abbaas ansaari jo bhale raajnneeti ke na sahi magar shot gan shooting ke international khilaadi hai
 Abbas is not only the national champion among the top ten shooters in the world
 balki duniyabar main kai padak jitkar desh kaa naam raushan kar chuke hai
 Now it is the responsibility of Abbas Ansari to carry this legacy forward

 There is also a urinal along with the commode to defecate in these toilets built in the prime minister's model village of Jayapur
 hanth dhone ke liye nal ke saath pani aane ke liye bagal main tank bhi banaai gai he
 But if we look closely, there is a place of pipe connection in it but there is no water connection
 lihaaja pani ke bina gaanv waalon ke liye ye bekaar hi sabit ho rahi he
 When asked about these toilets from Ramjit Verma of the village, he immediately said that "this toilet which has been built has only been erected, there is no water system in it
" chote-chote bachche jate hai to pani nahin le ja pate isliye usamen badi gandagee rahati he
 There is a shortage of water in it, so people do not go
 sirf pani hi nahin isamen or bhi kai kamiyaan he
 For example, toilets have been made, but there is no lid in the pit that has been made for defecation
 or gadde bhi sirf paanch paanch foot ke banaae gaye hai
 So the villagers are not using it for defecation but the container is standing, so they are protecting their kande (uplea) from the rain by keeping it in it
 kyonki unki nigaah main ye shauchalay kisi kaam ke nahin
 This feeling of the villagers Rajkumar is very well narrated, "sir, this letrine which has been made very useless is not worth any use
 If you want to use, make one instead of two
 kuch logon ne bataaya ki fibre or tin se bane ye shauchalay jameen par bas khadey hi hai
 So many of them fell in the strong storm
 jinhen baad main khadaa kiya gaya
 The comments gaanv ke pradhan kehete hai ki kuch hi shauchalay kharaab hai or unki shikaayat kaarydaayi sanstha se kar di gai he
 And they have also assured to fix it by conducting a survey
 yahaan par kai chije acchhee bhi bani he jiname sadak, solar lit, bas stand, anganbari ke kamare, ladakiyon kaa chota skool or musaharon ke liye atal nagar jiname takreeban das makaan bane he

 jaise shauchalay to bana diya gaya par mel jane ke liye jo gaddha banaaya gaya he usame dhakkan hi nahin bana
 And the pits are also built just five by five feet
 lihaaja gaanv vaale ise shouch ke liye to nahin yuj kar rahe par dabba khadaa he lihaaja barsaat se apane conde (upale) kii hi raksha kar rahe hai usame rakh kar

 input: bhashaa In the first Test cricket match against South Africa of the Indian batting lineup, called the best in the world, flew in front of the bombardment of short pitch balls by Morne Morkel and Dale Steyn
 subah kii barish ke baad groundsman ke athak prayaas se chaar ghante baad pich khilne laayak to ban gayi, lekin morkal or sten ne use bharatiyon ke liye kabrgah banane main der nahin lagaayi
 When the game was halted due to poor lighting, India were struggling for 136 for 9 wickets
 captain mahendra singh dhoni ab bhi 33 ran banaakar krij par hai
 Apart from him, the contribution of Sachin Tendulkar (36) and Harbhajan Singh (27) was a little remarkable
 dakshin africa kii taraf se morkal ne 12
 Four for 20 runs in 1 over, while Steyn has taken three wickets for 34 runs
 dakshin africa captain greem smith ne pich kii nami ko dekhakar tas jitkar bharat ko pehle ballebaaji ke liye aamantrit karne main koi der nahin lagaayi
 After this, the world's most famous Indian batting lineup was shattered towards cards
 tendulkar kuch der vishwaas ke saath khel paye jabaki baaki ballebaajon virendra sahvaag (shunya), gautam gambhir (paanch), rahul dravid (14), vivies lakshmana (saat) or suresh raina (ek) ne dakshin africa akraman ke saamne natmastak hone main der nahin lagaayi
 India had a dreadful start and the South African bowlers showed that they have come out on the ground by preparing a good strategy for the Indian opening pair
 sahvaag or sten kii bahucharchit jang keval teen gend tak hi simit rahi
 Sehwag played the bowler with two balls from the first over of the first over, but the first ball of his second over returned him to the pavilion
 sahvaag ne aaf stump se baahar teji se uthati gend par apper cat kiya lekin gend boundry paar jane ke bajaay third main par khadey hashim amala ke haathon main chali gayi
 Had there been a referral system, Gambhir might have been out earlier but this left-handed batsman was seen struggling the whole time despite playing 43 balls
 morkal ne short pich gendon se unki acchhee pariksha lekin jab unke saamne achaanak phullength gend padi to vah drive karne ke liye teji se front foot par nahin aa paye or pehali slip main khadey paal haris ko kaich de baithe
 Dravid made a reliable start and hit two fours in one over from Steyn
 is bich 11 ran puure karte hi vah bryan lara ke 11,953 ran kii sankhya paar karke sarvaadhik ran banane vaale duniya ke tisare ballebaaj bane lekin morkal kii middle or leg stump par jaati sidhi gend par vah pagabaadha out ho gayi
 Short pitch ball did not show any effect on Tendulkar
 unhone badlaav ke rup main aaye lonawabo sotsobe ko nishane par rakhaa tathaa unke do over main do
 Put two fours
 chaay ke vishram tak bharat kaa daaromadar unheen par tha, lekin iske baad bhi dakshin africa gendbaajon kaa dabadabaa rahaa jisamen tendulkar kii nahin chali
 Tendulkar hit two fours on Steyn and then hit the same bowler in the 25th over of the innings with a beautiful cut, but could not understand the straight ball in the same over and lbw to the pavilion
 is tarah se apni 34 gend kii pari main aath chauke lagane vaale tendulkar ko 50wein shatak ke liye intjaar karnaa hoga
 Dhoni also had to contend with the bowlers but Harbhajan showed the same attitude as he showed two centuries against New Zealand
 unhone sten par chaukaa jadkar khaataa kholaa or phir kallis ko nishane par rakhaa
 The right-handed batsman hit a four off Sotsobe's consecutive ball and then hit a six over long on to take India's score beyond 100
 harbhajan kaa wicket africaiyon ko nahin mila balki unhen doosraa ran lene main thodi dhilaayi kaa khamiyaja ran out ke rup main bhugatna padaa
 Morkel sent Ishant Sharma and then s Sreesanth to the pavilion in the same over after which Dhoni showed some speed
 unhone bhi sotsobe ko hi apane nishane par rakhaa or un par do chakke lagaaye
 Sotsobe gave 50 runs in nine overs

 aam aadmi party ke netaa arvind kejariwal abhivyakti kii swatantraaa kaa puraa istemaal karte hai or wo sab bolte hai jisase vah surkhiyon main bane rahen
 Starting with an anti-corruption activist, he is now playing the role of an Intelligence Agent and his example is the possibility of violence in Varanasi
 publicity main bada nasha hota he
 Once he gets addicted, he does not stop
 har vakt media main bane rahanaa bhala kise nahin suhayega
 Seeing your name in newspapers, websites and being surrounded by TV cameras is really exciting
 kejariwal ko yah sab pasand aata he or isliye vah ab har din koi na koi aisa bayaan de dete hai jisaki chaaron ore charchaa ho
 Anyway, he knows that his anti-corruption role and his statement no longer get that much publicity, so he opened a front against Varanasi against Modi and started communalism
 jaahir he bhartiya naagarik hone ke naate yah unka haq he
 But more than that, he knows that he will get much publicity there and hence he did not go to Sonia Gandhi's area
 vah ‘sookhaa ilaaka’ he or vahaan se khadey hone vaale ko vah publicity nahin mil sakati jo varanasi kii dharti se milegi
 So Kejriwal has become Varanasi
 modi ko sampradayik bataane ke baad ab vah vahaan hinsa hone kii ashanka bhi jataa rahe hai
 Now he has the smell of conspiracy in everything from BJP
 congress unke liye ab khaas myne nahin rakh rahi he kyonki vahaan publicity factor nahin he
 He is well aware that even if there is no Modi wave in the country, the discussion is his
 aise main unke bare main har bayaan unhen publicity dilaaegaa
 It is a matter of media that it happens with him
 uskaa phayda uthaa lene ke baad kai ‘mahaan’ vyaktiyon ne ulate us par hi aarope lagaaya
 Kejriwal is one of them
 media main unke khilaaf chhapi har khabar ko vah bade audyogic gharaanon kii sajeesh qaraar dete hai
 He does not accept criticism at all
 isaki bajaay vah media par baraskar apana gussa shant karte rahete hai
 He shrugs off uncomfortable media questions and then attacks him
 darasal isi media ne unhen itani publicity de di ki vah yah maanakar chalane lage ki unki kisi bhi vishay par aalochana nahin hogi
 And now when there is criticism, they are raging
 unhen lagata he ki media unke khilaaf he
 Kejriwal believes that he is the leader and system of the entire nation, but he is not accountable to anyone
 unki yah soch bhi unhen utapataang bayaan dene ke liye prerit karti he
 Now it will continue till the elections

 There have been differences between Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot and Deputy Chief Minister Sachin Pilot over 6 Bahujan Samaj Party mlas in Thanijarajasthan in gehlot-pilot over 6 BSP mlas joining Congress
 payalat kah rahe hai ki mantrimandal main pehali praathamikta congress ke khun pasinaa bahaane vaale vidhayakon ko milanaa chahie, to vahiin gahalot chaah rahe hai ki jinhone congress ke liye party chodi he unhen inaam dena chahie
 Pilot, the state president of Congress in Rajasthan, does not know that 6 mlas of Bahujan Samaj Party have become members of Congress
 basapa vidhayakon ke congress main aane ke baad party majboot hui he yaa kamjor hui he yah kisi ko samaj main nahin aa rahaa he
 Do not ask the matter of the heart
 
 
 mukhyamantri ashok gahalot chaahate hai ki bahujan samaaj party ke jo log congress main aae hai unhen kisi na kisi pad se nawaja jaae, to vahiin up mukhyamantri sachin payalat kah rahe hai unhone naitikta kaa sabase ucch maapdand ko dikhaaya he, bina kisi laalach ke ve congress ke andar aae hai
 Gehlot is understanding this political satire of the pilot
 payalat ne kaha ki mere or prabharee mahasachiv avinaash pandey ke dil kii baat mat poochna
 Pilot is pained that someone becomes a member of Congress and does not even meet the party head once in the state
 in chah vidhayakon main se kisi ne bhi abhi tak congress ke pradesh adhyaksh sachin payalat se mulaakaat nahin kii he
 On the other hand, Congress general secretary Avinash Pandey, who came to settle the quarrel between Pilot and Gehlot, said that the cabinet will be expanded quickly and the people of Bahujan Samaj Party who have left their party will also be considered
 mantri banane kii chakvinaash pandey ne party ke andar matbhed ko yah kehete hue dhakne kii koshish kii he ki party ke andar alag-alag vichaar hote hai yah kisi bhi party ke liye acchhee baat he
 The Bahujan Samaj Party mlas are also waiting to see when the cabinet gets expanded and he becomes a minister in the Gehlot government
 pichhali baar jo bahujan samaaj party ke 6 vidhayak 2010 main congress main shaamil hue the unamem se teen mantri bane the
 This time too, he hopes something similar will happen
 maamla itnaa bhar kaa nahin he, jo 13 nirdaleey congress ke associat member bane hai
 He too has been waiting for the pleasure of the government for the last 9 months
 unamem se zyaadaatar sachin payalat ke virdohi hai
 It is believed that Pilot has trumpeted by saying respect to Congress workers and leaders, due to which Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot will have to do a lot of good work in the formation of the cabinet
 bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar lokjanshkti party ke adhyaksh ramvilas paswan ko bhale hi acha aadmi maanate ho lekin unke mantrimandal ke sahyogi ramai ram unase sahamat nahin hai unka maananaa he ki ramvilas paswan bahuroopiya hai
 He clearly says that if the JDU is aligned with the Lok Janshakti Party, then those ministers will not delay at all
 lokjanshkti party ke adhyaksh ramvilas paswan ke ghor virdohi ramai ram kaa kahana he ki wo achche aadmi nahin hai balki bahuroopiya hai
 Ramai Ram said that Ram Vilas is a fraud, he used to say that he will light a lamp in every house, he has not yet gone to light the lamp
 ramai ram ne kaha ki wo ramvilas paswan ko kabhi netaa nahin maan sakate hai or unka hajipur se chunaav ladanaa vaisaa hi nishchit he jaise maranaa
 It is worth noting that recently Nitish Kumar and Ram Vilas Paswan had praised each other a lot
 nitish kumaar ne ramvilas paswan ko acha aadmi bataaya or kaha ki bhale hi gathbandhan ho yaa nahin ho lekin wo hameshaa mere liye sammanit rahen he
 Ram Vilas Paswan also praised Nitish Kumar a lot
 ye baaten ramai ram ko raas nahi aa rahi thi halaki party ke duusare netaa bhi nahin maanate hai ki lokjanshkti party se jediu kaa gathbandhan ho saktaa he kyonki ramvilas paswan kii shart he ki jo congress kaa dost hoga wo unka bhi mitra hoga
 JDU leaders are not taking Paswan's statement as a good sign
 nitish ne gathbandhan kii gend ramvilas paswan ke paale main yah kah kar daal diya he ki gathbandhan par faisla to ramvilas paswan ko hi karnaa he
 But made it clear that the possibility of his alliance with Congress has no merit
 saaf he ki jediu lokjanshkti party ke saath gathbandhan to chaahati he lekin congress ke shart par nahin
 However, Ram Vilas Paswan has given the Congress time till January 31 to decide on the alliance

 is maukey par saikadon log maujuud rahe the
 Temple committee member Abhay Singh said that this temple is a symbol of faith and it will not be allowed to be removed at any cost
 abhaya singh ne kaha, "mananeey mukhyamantri ji isi shahar ke vyakti he ek taraf mandir banane kii baat hoti he to duusari taraf mandir todane kii baat kii ja rahi he yah kisi bhi keemat par bardaasht nahin hoga
 "abhay Singh said," Maha Aarti has just been done
 Later Maha Aarti will be organized in every square intersection across the city

 After the father left, i had to go back to my mother in Punjab

 maa kabhi nahin bulaayaa

 Penguin will print it
 unhone kaha ki thik he, aap chah maheene main is kitaab ko likh dijie
 So for five months i was in depression, weeping
 iske baad maine maa se kaha ki ise to likhnaa padegaa
 Hold hands phir pataa nahin kaise maine ye kitaab ek maheene main puri likh di

 tanavagrast hona aaj kii jindagi main jitani saamaanya baat he, usase mukt hona utana hi kathin samajha jaataa he
 Most people, however, know that being stressed is not going to get anything, and if honest efforts are made, it is not too difficult to overcome
 log phir bhi ise kabhi na utaare ja sakane vaale boj kii tarah sir par laade phirte hai
 Well it is not so difficult to overcome, for this, the need is just strong will and honest effort
 keval yah thaan lene kii ki chaahe kuch bhi ho ham tanavagrast nahin honge
 The best solution to this is that you can overcome this by learning management methods
 dhyaan jo aapako karegaa nirvichaar : tanaav prabandhan kaa sabase prabhavi tarika to yahi he ki tanaav aapke paas aane hi na paae or iskaa kargar upaay he dhyaan
 If you keep meditating regularly then stress will not come around you
 jaisaa ki aamtaur par log samajhate hai, dhyaan koi rahasyamay yaa alokik jagat kaa maamla nahin he
 Its feeling may be supernatural, but the process is absolutely mundane and easy
 pratidin aap thodaa vakt nikaalen or chupchaap baith jaaen
 Whatever thoughts are coming in your mind, come or go, keep watching them silently
 thodi der man bhatakegaa, par agar niyamit rup se karte rahen to das-bees din baad vah vakt bhi aayega jab aap nirvichaar honge
 The deeper this process, the more the fear of stress will go away from you
 aisa bhi nahin he ki iskaa prayog aap keval tanavagrast hone se pehle hi kar sakate hai
 There is nothing even if you are stressed
 baad main bhi yah prayog shuru karke aap tanaav se mukt ho sakate hai
 Let the lists flourish: Another effective way is to develop your interest and creativity
 yah ruchi mitti ke khilone banane se lekar kavitaayen likhane, nae vyanjan banane kaa prayaas, net surfig karne, puraatatv yaa vigyaan sambandhi khoj, share bazaar main haath aajamaane yaa desh-videsh ke bare main jaankariyaan praapt karne tak kuch bhi ho saktaa he
 Complete whatever interests you
 agar aapako apni book rack yaa warderob sajaane kaa shauk he to yahi karen
 The biggest advantage of this will be that you will not have to sit empty and then you will not have to face unnecessary worries
 yah aapke man ko bhatakane se bachaayegaa, jisase aapako nakaaratmak vichaar nahin gher sakenge
 When your thinking is not negative then you will not suffer from stress
 swasthya or soch : teesraa tarika yah he ki apane swasthya kaa dhyaan rakhen
 Do all that is necessary to maintain good health
 jaise khelkud main hissaa len, jogging karen, yoga karen or samay se khaaen-pien bhi
 On the one hand, your mind will be saved from negative thoughts and on the other hand your body will remain healthy
 jab bhi aapako lage ki ab tanaav aapako gher saktaa he, turant soch kii disha badal den
 If nothing happens, pay attention to cleaning the nails
 iske alaava jab kabhi man sthir ho to man kii safai par dhyaan den
 Meditation, spirituality, worship of God and pranayama can help you in this
 un sabhi vichaaron ko chun-chunakar apane maansik se baahar nikaal den jo aapke bheetar pradooshan ke kaaran ban rahe hon
 Actually, such thoughts are formed due to stress
 shanti he jaruri : tanaav se bachane kaa chauthaa upaay he pradooshamukt vaataavaran
 Everyone is compelled to spend the whole day in a crowded and noisy environment
 lekin koshish yah karen ki raaten shantipurna hon
 Do not disturb sleep jab aap parivaar ke bich hon to apano ke bich hone kaa puraa anand len
 Unwanted voices, unwanted people, dust, smoke cannot disturb you, for this it is necessary that housing always take a place which is peaceful
 sansadhano ke liye thodi asuvidha bhale ho, par bazaar or audyogic sthalon se dur ho
 Also see that there is some greenery and parks etc
 around there, here you can spend some time in the morning and evening
 tabhi aap puri neend bhi le sakenge or jivan kaa anand bhi
 If nothing like this is possible, then choose a quiet place in your house and sit calm
 paaltu pashuon ko den samay : paaltu pashu manoranjan to karte hi hai, kai baar ye aapke liye suraksha kavach bhi ban jate hai
 Therefore give adequate importance to domesticated animals
 yah tanaav se mukti kaa paanchvaan upaay he
 If there is no dog, cat or anything else, then keep colorful fish in small aquariums
 unka dhyaan rakhen or apana kuch keemtee vakt bhi unke saath bitaayen
 You can entertain your mind by this, you will not feel lonely
 neend puri karen : tanaav se ubarne kaa chatha upaay he gahari neend
 In this era of fierce competition, most people are unable to get enough sleep
 dhyaan rakhen, bistar par pade rahanaa alag baat he, lekin paryaapt neend nahin lenaa bilkul alag maamla he
 At least six hours of sleep is necessary for every person, but nowadays only three hours of sleep can be taken by less people
 iske chalate tanaav hona bilkul aam he
 So still get a chance to sleep and try to get deep sleep
 agar aapako aasaani se nahin aati he yaa bich-bich main neend tuutati he to sone se pehle thodi der dhyaan karen
 Then when you go to sleep, after lying on the bed, focus your attention on the sound of breath
 yah prayaas kuch din to aapako mushkil lag saktaa he, lekin baad main isse gahari neend aegi
 Walk far away: Everyday routine, same hi-taaba and same place - these situations create boredom within every man
 ub bhi tanaav kaa ek bada kaaran ho saktaa he
 Therefore, when you feel tension and do not find yourself recovering from other arrows, then use this seventh remedy
 lambii chuttee len or kuch dinon ke liye kahin dur chale jaaen
 Choose a place that is not a very popular tourist destination
 apekshaakrit anjaani jagah ho
 It would be best to go to a remote hill station
 koi aisa hill stesan jahaan paryaton kii vyavsaayik apadhapi na ho
 If you do not find such places in the mountains, then you can also opt for village tourism
 ghumen-phiren, mouj-masti karen, nae mitra banaaen or mauka mili to spa bhi ho aaen
 After this you will feel yourself completely new and you will be able to relieve stress
 is tarah dekhen to tanaav ko dur bhagaanaa koi kathin baat nahin he
 The only need is that no matter what happens, you do not have to be stressed
 vaise bhi samasyaayein tanaav se nahin, sahi tareeke se or sahi disha main kiye gaye prayaas se hal hoti hai
 Then why should stress be brought to rest? tiarai (telecom regaulatory athurity of india) ne downlod speed kii list jari kii he

 Bollywood superstar Salman Khan may have become a guarantee of success of films today, but not only did he have to go through a strict screen test to work in the 1989 Rajshri Production film 'maine Pyaar Kiya', but actor Kunal Goswami for that role And Deepak Tijoriwala had been shortlisted
 penguin prakaashan kii pustak ‘aise kyon hai salmaan’ main kaha gaya he ki salmaan kii kismat kaa sitara pehali baar 1989 main us vakt chamakaa jab bataur hero unki film ‘maine pyaar kiya’ relies hui
 The success of this film made him a Bollywood superstar, but this film got Salman after much effort and he had to give tough screen test beyond today's situation
 isamen bataaya gaya he ki rajshri production main nirmaataa-nirdeshak tarachand badjatya ke pote suraj badjatya un dinon apni pehali film bana rahe the
 He shortlisted Kunal Goswami and Deepak Tijoriwala for the lead roles in this film
 lekhak jasim khan pustak main salmaan ke hawaale se bataate hai, 'main suraj se milane nahin ja rahaa tha, lekin hani ankal ne kaha, jaao mil aao
 Suraj said that he has shortlisted two names
 ' The book mentions that Salman Khan's writing assistant Honey Gupta was recommended for this role of 'maine Pyaar Kiya'
 iske liye duusari sifarish karne vaali model shabana datta thim, jinhone us film main us role ke liye audishan diya tha, jise parde par baad main bhagyashri ne nibhaayaa tha
 The third recommendation for him was made by writer Qamar Naqvi, who wrote the screenplay for Bhagyashree
 pustak main kaha gaya he ki iske baavjood suraj badjatya ne unhen mumbai ke varli main rajshri film ke bangale main bulaayaa or puure din salmaan kaa screen test kiya gaya
 After this, Suraj once again called Salman and Bhagyashree to his office to shoot a scene
 darasal, ve donon kii on screen camestry dekhnaa chaahate the

 unke liye pradesh ke har jile main jald se jald gaushala banavaai jaaen, jahaan unhen surakshit rakhaa ja sake

 Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi made a tweet on the occasion of Children's Day, remembering her maternal grandfather Jawaharlal Nehru
 unhone is twit main us santarika zikr kiya jise nehru ji ne apane bistar par sota hua dekh kar, use uthaane kii jagah pehle uske upar kambal rakhaa or baad main paas hi rakhi aramkarsi par jaakar so gaye
 Remembering this simplicity of Nehru ji, Priyanka Gandhi tweeted that this is the sweetest memory i have of my great grandfather
 priyanka gandhi ne apane twit main jis santari kaa zikr kiya he unka naam swargeey maujii ram he
 NDTV spoke to Priyanka Gandhi's tweet, Mukesh Bhardwaj, grandson of the late Mauji Ram, who is currently in the Delhi Police and serving as a head constable at the Malviya Nagar police station
 unhone bataaya ki unkapariwaar teen pidhiyon se dilli police se judaa he
 He is originally from Dariapur village in Delhi
 mukesh ne apane dada ke is kisse ko hamase saajha kiya
 My favorite story about my great-grandfather is the one about when as PM, he returned from work at 3 am to find his bodyguard exhausted and asleep on his bed
 He covered him with a blanket and slept on an adjacent chair
 # jawaharlalnehrupic
 twitter
 com / hddic1hked He told that something happened during that time that Dada ji used to do duty as a sentry at Nehru ji's house
 is dauraan unka kaam duusare kaamon ke saath- saath rajeev gandhi or sanjay gandhi ke saath hi zyada vakt bitta tha
 For this reason Rajiv and Sanjay Gandhi had a special attachment to Mauji Ram
 mukesh ne kaha ki dada ji akasar kehete the ki nehru ji ko asi main sona pasand nahin tha jabaki indira gandhi asi main sonapasand karti thi
 One day, for some work, my grandfather went to Nehru's room for some work
 asi kaaphi pehle se chal rahaa tha is vajah se cameraa thanda ho chukaa tha
 Seeing so much coolness inside the room in summer, my grandfather decided to stay there for a while
 vah nehru ji ke bistar par thodi der baithne ke baad kuch der ke liye let gaye
 After this, he did not know when he fell asleep
 kuch der baad vahaan nehru ji aae
 He noticed that his sentry is already sleeping on his bed
 nehru ji ne apane santri ko uthaane kii jagah uske upar pehle kambal daalaa or akhbaar lekar paas hi aaraam kursi baith gaye
 After reading the newspaper for some time, Nehruji also fell asleep
 kuch der ke baad unke ek or santari ne dekha ki nehru ji apane kamare main aaraam kursi par so rahe hai jabaki unka santari maujii ram unke bistar par soya hua he
 It was quickly given to senior officials
 lekin kisi main itani himmat nahin ho rahi thi ki vah nehru ji ke kamare main jaakar maujii ram ko uthaae
 After a long time, Mauji Ram was somehow raised
 baad main maujii ram ko vibhageeya kaarywai karte hue terminete kar diya gaya 
 Indira Gandhi started asking about him when Mauji did not come to Ram Nehru's house for a few days
 unhone nehru ji se poocha ki kya aapane us santari (maujii ram) ko naukari se nikaal diya he
 To this Nehru replied, absolutely not
 iske baad dilli police ke varisht adhikariyon ko vishesh rup se maujii ram ko waapas bulaane ke liye unke gaanv bheja gaya
 When a Delhi Police truck arrived in the village, there was a stir among the villagers
 khud maujii ram ghar se nikal paas ke khet main bane ek jhopade main ja chhipe
 They thought that the police had come to catch them and they would be arrested and put in jail
 baad main police waalon ne gaanvon ke bujurg logon ko samajhaayaa ki nehru ji ne maujii ram ko dobaaraa naukari par bulaane ke liye bheja he
 Some of the village elders went with Mauj Ram, and came back to the village only after Mauj Ram did not join the job
