 On the indication of an alliance between the Congress and the RJD in the next Lok Sabha elections, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar said that the relationship between these two parties is old and they are trying to bring back the same dark days of misrule and bad law and order in this state
 Are engaged bihar ko vishesh rajya kaa darja dilaane ko jadyu dwaara shanivaar ko yahaan yojit sankalp raily ko sambodhit karte hue congress or rajd ke bich gathbandhan hone ke sanket par nitish ne kaha ki in donon dalon kaa rishta purana he tathaa ve is rajya main kushasan or kharaab vidhi vyavastha ke usee kaale dinon ko phir waapas laane kii koshish main lage hue hai
 He said that the alliance between these two parties is old and before the coming to power of his government, the state of Bihar was in a mixed government at that time
 chaara ghotaalaa ke ek maamle ucchtam nyaayalay se jamaanat milane main dhai maheene se adhik samay se ranchi jail main band rahe rajd supremeo lalu prasad kii rihaai kii charchaa karte hue nitish ne kaha ki ve aise vyavhaar kar rahe hai jaise swatantraaa kii ladaai ladakar andar (jail) gaye the
 Pointing to Nitish being held responsible for Lalu's jail by the RJD, he said that the Congress-led UPA government is in Delhi and the CBI that sent him to jail works under the central government
 nitish ne lalu par aisa logon kii sahanubhuti hasil karne ke liye aisa karne kaa aarope lagaate hue kaha ki ve jail gaye apni 'kerani ke kaaran' gaye
 He said that Lalu's going to jail was not a political event but a judicial decision
 unhen bhrashtachar ke aarope main sajaa hui thi, par jail se baahar aane ke baad lalu jis prakaar se apane pesh kar rahe use badhkar koi or ho hi nahin saktaa
 Nitish said that neither did he react to Lalu's going to jail nor did he come out of jail, but the people of Bihar understand why Lalu went to jail
 adaalat se sajaa milane par jail gaye or usee se jamaanat milane par baahar aae
 Nitish said pointing to the previous RJD regime, he said that during the last eight years of his derailment, the Bihar car which had derailed, worked hard day and night to get him on the right path

 aaj vaataavaran badla he bihar main shahar ho yaa gaanv kanoon kaa raaj kaayam hua he
 Nitish warned the people to remember the atmosphere that was there in Bihar during the RJD regime and then an attempt would be made to maintain that atmosphere
 unhone kaha ki koun kahata he ki rajd shasankaal ke dauraan bihar main paisa nahin tha kyonki agar rajya ke khajaane main raashi nahin thi to chaara ghotaale ke jariye khajaana ko kaise lutaa gaya
 Nitish said that this is the difference between the previous RJD regime of the state and his reign, yesterday the state treasury was looted, today it is being put into the development works of the state
 unhone kaha ki bhaajapa ke saath hamaara gathbandhan kaaryakramon ke aadhaar par aadhaarit tha jisamen na to vivaadit muddon ko ubhaara jayega or na hi vivaadit vyaktiyon (narendra modi) ko saamne laayaa jayega
 Nitish said that he walked under the leadership of Atal Bihari Vajpayee but later started trying to highlight the contentious issues
 nitish ne daawa kiya ki bhaajapa ke saath gathbandhan ke samay yah tay hua tha ki jammu-kashmir se judi dhara 370 ko akshunn rakhaa jayega, samaan aachaar samhita thopane kii baat nahin hogi tathaa ayodhya masale kaa samaadhaan aapasi baatcheet yaa adaalat ke faisle se hoga

 aise main ham logon ko laga ki ab ek saath aage chalanaa sambhav nahin he, isliye siddhant kii khatir is gathbandhan se alag hone kaa nirnay liya
 Nitish said that we knew that the government which was in Bihar had tremendous power, including the number of JDU and BJP mlas, but we did not approve of the government
 vah apane buniyadi siddhanton ke saath samjhauta nahin kar sakate
 He said that people of all religions in this country have the right to live and grow equally and there should be no discrimination against anyone

 dhaniram zyaadaatar gaadiyaan churaataa he or khud hi farji kagajaat bana kar unhen aage bech detaa he

 The Ram temple issue was in the news before the announcement of Lok Sabha elections 2019, but the terrorist agenda in Pulwama has completely changed the electoral agenda
 ram mandir ke sahare raajnneeti main jagah banane vaali bhartiya janata party bhi ab is is mudde ke bajaay rashtrawaad ke sahare siyaasi jang jeetne kii kavayad main he
 The interesting thing is that even the veteran faces of the BJP, who once used to be the heroes of the Ram temple movement, are not entering this election field
 ram mandir andolan ke sahare hi bijepi desh or pradesh kii siyasat main jagah banane main kaamyaab rahi thi
 The BJP, which won only 2 Lok Sabha seats in 1984, was successful in bringing the Hindu vote bank into its fold through the temple issue
 isi kaa nataji tha ki 1989 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi do se sidhe 85 siton par pahunch gai
 After this, the BJP continued to move forward and came to power with full majority in the 2014 elections
 atal bihari vaajapeyi, adwani, murali manohar joshi, uma bharti, vinay katiyaar, kalyaan singh, calraj mishra, sadhvi ritambhra, swami chinmayanand or ram vilaas vedanti aise netaa hai, jo bijepi ke hi nahin balki ram mandir andolan ke cheharaa bhi hua karte the
 Of these, Atal Bihari Vajpayee has passed away
 vahiin, baaki bache netaaon ko bijepi chunavi maidan main nahin utaar rahi he
 However, there are some leaders in it, who were not even made candidates in the last election
 alke adwanibijepi ne is baar party ke sansthaapak sadsy or ram mandir andolan ke nayak rahe laalkrishna adwani ko tikat nahin diya he
 Advani continues to win from Gandhinagar
 is baar party ne unki jagah amit shah ko maidan main utaara he
 Advani was the only leader who took a rath yatra from Somnath in Gujarat to Ayodhya, which gave the BJP considerable political advantage
 murali manohar joshiram mandir andolan se jude bijepi ke diggaj netaa murali manohar joshi kaa bhi party ne tikat kaat diya he
 This time the party has fielded Satyadev Pachauri in his place
 ayodhya main babari masjid ko karsevakon ne jab vidhwans kiya tha, us samay bijepi kii kaman murali manohar joshi ke haathon main thi
 The result was that Joshi had carried Uma Bharti on his shoulders after the Babri demolition
 uma bharatiram mandir andolan main ahm kirdaar nibhaane vaali uma bharti ne khud hi is baar ke loksabhaa chunaav ladane se manaa kar diya he
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Uma Bharti was elected as an MP from Jhansi seat in Uttar Pradesh
 isse pehle wo madhya pradesh ke khajuraho loksabhaa seat se chunaa maidan main utarati rahi hai
 Uma Bharti has been a veteran leader of the Ram temple
 vinay katiyaarram mandir andolan ke dauraan bijepi ke pramukh chehron main vinay katiyaar kaa naam bhi aata he
 This time the party has not fielded him
 haalanki isse pehle wo rajyasabha sadsy the
 Interestingly, Vinay Katiyar has been reaching Parliament from Faizabad Lok Sabha seat
 katiyaar teen baar faijabad se saansad chune gaye, lekin is baar bhi unhen tikat nahin diya gaya he
 Kalraj Mishrakalraj Mishra has also been one of the prominent faces of the Ram temple movement
 is baar party unhone chunavi maidan main utarane se manaa kar diya he
 Whereas in the last Lok Sabha election, he was elected from Deoria parliamentary seat and reached Parliament and became a minister in Modi government
 haalanki isse pehle tak calraj mishra centre ke bajaay upi kii raajnneeti main kismat aajamaaya karte the
 Kalyan Singh The chief face of the Ayodhya movement and Kalyan Singh, who lost his power, is currently the Governor of Rajasthan
 sanvaidhanik pad par hone ke naate wo chunavi maidan main nahin utar sakate hai
 Although in active BJP politics, Kalyan Singh was a prominent leader of the Ram Mandir movement
 unke kaarykaal main hi babari masjid vidhwans hua tha
 For this, he has also been sentenced to one day
 ram mandir andolan ke ye chehre nadaardaram mandir andolan ke in chehron ke alaava bhi kai pramukh netaaon ke naam hai
 These include the names of Sadhvi Ritambhara, Swami Chinmayananda and Ram Vilas Vedanti, who made their mark in politics through the Ram Mandir movement
 iske baad bijepi se saansad bhi chune gai the
 But the party has not given ticket in the earlier elections
 swami chinmayanad to 2014 main tikat maang rahe the, lekin bijepi ne unhen nahin diya he
 Similarly, Ram Vilas Vedanti has also become a side line in BJP and these days he is leading the movement for the construction of Ram temple

 The BJP accused the UPA government of reversing the Kashmir policy of India through proposals such as encouraging the return of Kashmiri youth from Pakistan Occupied Kashmir, while doing nothing to rehabilitate thousands of Kashmiri Pandits
 , Who have migrated from the state
 bijepi ke varisht netaa murali manohar joshi ne kaha, ‘‘yah sarkaar ab yah kah rahi he ki shastr prashikshan ke liye jo yuvak paak adhikrut kashmir gayi hai, unka ‘man’ badal gaya he or unki bharat vaapasi ko protsaahit kar rahe hai
 This is a dangerous statement and it is not in the interest of the country
 ’’ purv kendriya mantri ne sarkaar se poocha ki vah kis aadhaar par is nattejey par pahunchi he ki in yuvakon kaa hriday parivartan ho gaya he
 Joshi asked, "has any study been done to find this out or has it been done under international pressure?" What is the guarantee that after coming back they will not be involved in terrorist activities
 yadi unhone chhipakar kuch kiya, to phir kya hoga? kya is bare main koi ricard he ki kitne or koun-koun se log paak adhikrut kashmir gayi hai
 Joshi said nothing was done for the Kashmiri Pandits who were forced to leave the state during the height of terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir
 unhone kaha, ‘‘ve (kashmiri pandit) bhi bhartiya hai, lekin aapke (samprag sarkaar ke) dil main unke liye kuch bhi nahin he
 When he had to leave Kashmir, he faced cultural genocide and ethnic extermination
 ’’ joshi ne aarope lagaaya ki sarkaar kashmir mudde par alag-alag swar main bol rahi he or vah jammu kashmir kii samasyaon kii bajaay pakistan ke prati naram ruukh apana rahi he
 He said, "it shows that the government is reversing Kashmir policy
" haalanki, sansad is baat par ekamat se raji he ki samoochaa kashmir bharat kaa hissaa he or desh ne is baat ko hameshaa se mana he, lekin samprag sarkaar is niti ke saath khadi nahin he or peeche hat rahi he
 Joshi cited the joint statement of India and Pakistan recently released in Sharm el-sheikh and the plea made by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in Havana, in which he said that Pakistan is also suffering from terrorism
 party ke purv adhyaksh ne samprag sarkaar par yah aarope bhi lagaaya ki vah nyaayamurti sagir ahamed samiti kii report ke mutabik kashmir ko swaittata dene kaa vikalp talash rahi he
 Today there is a Hindi film named Rizil which is only named in English
 diarector anant mahadevan ke mutabik film 'staying elive' ke liye unhen hindi kaa koi bejod tital nahin mila
 However, this story is about an experience in the life of film writer Sujit Sen
 ek aspataal ke isiu main


agal bagal ke bistaron par do insaan maut se jujh rahe hai
 Both have had heart attacks
 ek patrkaar he doosraa nami gangster
 Fear of death brings a desire to live life, both family anxiety and the loneliness of the ICU ward bring both patients closer
 isiu ke baahar bhi ek jaise halaat marijon kii patniyon ko kareeb le aate hai jo alag-alag becoground se hai
 The idea is good but the story is short and lacks twists and turns
 zyaadaatar seens isiu ke andar yaa baahar hone ke kaaran kahin-kahin ye monotons bhi lagati he lekin flashbek khubsuurati se daale gaye hai
 There is a fear of death in background music
 navni parihaar, anant mahadevan, ranjana sasa ke achche parformens lekin saurabh shukla gangster ke role main chhap chhod gaye
 The climax is excellent when life in the shadows of death steals moments of smiles
 yahi film kii jeet he



 And my rating for this is 3 stars
 maut kaa dar jindagi jeene kii ichha parivaar kii chintaa or isiu ward kaa akelaapan donon marijon ko kareeb le aata he
 Similar situations outside the ICU also bring patients' wives closer, who are from different backgrounds
 idia acha he lekin kahani choti-si he isamen tivest or turn kii kami he
 Most of the scenes are monotonous at times due to being inside or outside the ICU, but the flashbacks are beautifully inserted
 becoground mujeec main maut kaa dar he
 Good performances by Navni Parihar, Anant Mahadevan, Ranjana Sasa but Saurabh Shukla left a mark in the role of gangster
 climex behtareen he jab maut ke saaye main jindagi muskuraahat ke pal chura leti he
 This is the victory of the film



 or iske liye meri reating he 3 star

 Colleges should have cut down from first to fifth cut off to fill these seats, but did not do so, which last year also reserved category students were denied admission
 is varsh bhi vahiin sthiti doharaai ja rahi he
 Till the third cut-off and fourth cut-off, the admission of reserved class students has been very less and colleges have not reduced their cut-off, except for a few colleges, in most colleges, 15 to 20 percent and 30 percent ST class seats

 college sweekrut siton se 10 fisadi zyada hi karte hai admician- pro
 Suman has said that colleges admit 10% of the seats from the approved seats in all subjects, but as much as they give admission to the students of general classes, the students of all classes should be given admission but colleges do not do so
 unhone bataaya he ki kuch collejon ne sweekrut siton se dabl admician kar liye magar unhone arakshit shrenee kii siton ko uski evaj main nahin bharaa
 College is violating the adjustment plan
 suman ne bataaya he ki diu main arakshit varg ke chaatro ke liye adzestment plan bhi he jiske tahat un chaatro ko saamaanya virgo ke chaatro se adhik ank paae hai unhen saamaanya shrenee main rakhaa jaataa he, baad main use arakshit varg kii suvidhaon kaa laabh yadi lenaa chaahate hai to suvidhaayen di jaati he
 Let me tell you that most of the colleges do not adopt this method (adjustment plan) to fill the blank number, they keep them in reserved category
 jabaki pichley saalon main unhen saamaanya shrenee main admician dete rahe hai
 Pro do not display data on college website
 suman ne bataaya he ki ujisi ke niyamanusaar prayek vishvavidhyalay / santhaan / college ko apane yahaan ho rahe shikshakon / karmchaariyon va chaatro ke pravesh sambandhi aankadon ko college / santhaan apni website par disple karnaa anivaary he lekin koi bhi college is niyam kaa paalan nahin karte,jabaki har saal ujisi vishvavidhyalayon / sansthaanon ko website par data disple karne ke liye circular jari karata he
 Demand for special drive to fill reserved class seats, colleges in Delhi University, undergraduate level, issued five cut-off lists for admission
 lekin in paanch cat of list jari hone ke pashchaat bhi essi, asti, obisi or peedblyoody kii collejon main 20 se 30 fisadi siten khaali padi hui he
 To fill these vacant seats, colleges first put their data on the website and for the vacant seats, seats should be filled with students by running special drives as soon as possible so that timely admission will allow these students to take classes and continue their education
 pro
 Suman has also written in his letter that the problems related to the admission of reserved class students should be resolved at the earliest so that these students can be admitted on time and these students can continue their education

 Indeed, during the Quetta Gladiators innings, in the 13th over, batsman Umar Amin played a strong shot off the ball of Karachi Kings bowler Mohammad Irfan
 aisa lag rahaa tha ki gend boundry line paar kar jaaegi
 But, despite losing his balance on the boundary line, Shahid Afridi cleverly and swiftly bounced the ball into the air and first came inside the boundary himself and then quickly came back and caught the ball
 Shahid Afridi is truly an ageless cricketer
 21 years after his debut he is still finding ways to entertain the crowd
 The catch by him today, without exaggeration, is the greatest effort by a Pakistani fielder on the boundary
 He's the real Karachi King! Pic

 It does not matter what effect it has on the health of the society especially the children
 iskaa vigyaapan karne waalon kii maansikta bhi isse upar nahin rahi
 Only keep getting money, no matter what you advertise
 in logon ko samaaj ke kaaran hi lokapriyata mili, jiske chalate inhen vigyaapan ke liye upyukt mana gaya, lekin usee samaaj ke prati inkaa daayitvabodh kya tha
 Be it Amitabh Bachchan, or Madhuri Dixit or anyone else, today these people say that they advertised on Nestle's trust
 takneekee rup se ye baaten inkaa bachaav kar sakati he
 But on the moral side, they cannot be defended
 ham maan sakate hai ki amitabh or maadhuri kaa kahana sach ho, lekin vigyaapan karte samay company ke vishwaas par nahin varan rakam par dhyaan diya jaataa he
 Otherwise, no one knows what he is not an expert on, how can he advertise it? amitabh or maadhuri ne kabhi 'khaadya-vigyaan' kaa adhyayan nahin kiya hoga
 In such a situation, how can they advertise any food item? lekin phir bhi aisa hota he
 Famous faces are immediately ready to advertise the subject which has nothing to do
 samaaj hit par nijee hit baari hone ke kaaran hi aisa hota he
 It was quite possible that if such a famous face did not advertise Maggi, it would not have gained so much popularity
 tab kisi ne isamen prayukt hone vaali saamagree par vichaar nahin kiya
 In case of dispute, if the agreement was signed with the legal condition, then there was also a feeling of personal interest in it, that means he will take the amount of the advertisement himself, the company will fight if there is a lawsuit
 bachaav kii yah daleel bhi bhraamak he
 It is now known that Maggi maker Nestlé has been accused of ignoring food safety standards
 yahaan khaadya vibhaag ke jimmedaar adhikari bhi aarope ke ghere main hai
 Maggi was popular for so many years, but not a single officer thought it necessary to pay attention to its food standards
 kya mana jaae ki is str par bhi dhan kaa prabhaav nahin rahaa hoga
 Maggi samples revealed after so many years that the amount of monosodium blutamate and lead was 17 times higher than the limit
 is maamle main koun kitna doshi he, yah to jaanch ke baad pataa chalegaa
 The matter is now in the judiciary
 lekin yah to maananaa padegaa ki kisi bhi str par samaaj ke mahatvapurn logon ne apni jimmedaari kaa nirvaah nahin kiya
 Its advertisement started in just two minutes
 matlab ise maatr do minute main pakaakar bacchon ke saamne parosa ja saktaa he
 Modern mothers are also happy, children are also happy
 is khushi main swasthya kii baat peeche chhot gai
 Maggi baking and eating became part of modernism
 bade-bujurg bhi swaad aajamaane lage
 The advantages of gram, chabena, sattu are indisputable, but they become a sign of backwardness
 hajaaron karod kii sampatti ke maalik film va khel jagat ke lokapriy chehron main kya ek baar bhi yah vichaar nahin aayaa ki vah apni taraf se in khaadya padaartho ke seven kii bacchon ko prerana na den
 He can attribute the success of his life to maggi or any oil, but cannot properly teach children proper food and drink
 kitne cricket khilaadiyon par aarope lagata rahaa he ki vah khel se zyada vigyapanon par dhyaan dete hai
 The time they should put into practice, they put in advertisements
 phir vahi baat, vigyaapan bhi un vastuon ke, jinke bare main unhen koi jaankaree nahin hoti
 Only an expert can tell about food items in particular
 lekin uske liye bhi film or cricket ke sitare taiyaar rahete hai
 Not a single thing of them is rational
 saaf lagata he ki puri uchhal-kud keval paison ke liye kii ja rahi he
 If you believe their advertisements, then fast food will have to be believed to be complete nutrition
 lekin chikitsa vigyaan isse sahamat nahin
 That is why children from rich families also suffer from malnutrition
 vigyapanon kaa ek aapattijanak pahalu yah bhi he ki adhikansh main nari ko galat rup main pesh kiya jaataa he
 It has also become a part of modernism
 pragatisheel mahilaon ko kabhi in baton ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaate nahin dekha gaya
 Wrong words and illustrations are often used for women
 megi maamla nishchit hi aankh kholane vaala sabit ho saktaa he
 Money is essential for life
 lekin ise adharm arthath asaamaajik raste se chalakar praapt karne kaa prayaas nahin hona chahie
 Profit should be auspicious
 jisase samaaj ko nuksaan ho, un vastuon kaa utpaadan na kiya jaae
 Items that do not have authentic information should not be advertised
 vahiin yah abhibhavakon kii jimmedaari he ki vah apane bacchon ko uchit khan-paan ke liye prerit karen

 The United Nations has released a report with some staggering figures and findings, stating that Dalits and especially Dalit women in India have been pushed to full margins, exemplifying the extreme state of attitudes towards this society
 Huh
 sanyukt raashtra kii ‘vishwa saamaajik sthiti report 2010’ main kaha gaya he ki bharat, nepal or pakistan ke samaaj main jati aadhaarit vyavastha ke kaaran nichali jati ke log bahishkaar ke shikaar hai
 The report of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, prepared every two years, assesses the social status of the world based on the population between 1981 and 2005
 haal hi main nayi dilli main jari hui is report main bharat ke sandarbh main kaha gaya he ki desh main rahane vaale daliton kii khaskar sehat ke maamle main sthiti kaaphi gambhir he
 According to the report, in India, 44% of the children belonging to non-dalit castes are underweight, whereas 54% of the children of Dalits are underweight due to lack of proper food
 anya jatiyon main prati hajaar shishuon main se 68 kii maut ho jaati he, jabaki iske mukaable prati hajaar daliton main se 83 shishu janm lete hi dam tod dete hai
 The UN report says that out of every one thousand of Dalits, 119 children die at the age of five or less, while in the rest of the population this figure is 92 children per thousand
 bharat main unchi jatiyon ke pariwaron main, dalit pariwaron main vastuon ke upbhog par prati parivaar hone vaale vyay ke mukaable 42 fisadi zyada kharch hota he
 Jayati Ghosh, an economist and professor in the economics department of Jawaharlal Nehru University, said, "the findings of the report are really worrying and we can overcome their problems only by providing employment opportunities to Dalits
" rashtriya rojgaar guarantee yojana ‘naregaa’ ke jariye ek shuruyaat jarur hui he
 Under this, Dalits are also among the people who are getting employment opportunities in rural areas
 lekin hamen ab bhi lambii duuri tay kerani he
 "he said," But the bigger problem is that Dalits are kept at the center of politics and we are unable to pay attention to their basic needs
 vartmaan main daliton ke liye sarkarein jo kar rahi hai, vah mahaj sankethik he
 In this report of the United Nations, the situation of Indian Dalit women has been particularly concerned
 isamen kaha gaya he ki dalit mahilaayein apane samudaay or parivaar main hi hinsa kaa shikaar hoti hai
 Violence with them includes physical harassment, sexual harassment, rape, forced prostitution, kidnapping, female murder and domestic violence
 report main kaha gaya he ki bhoomi swaamitv ke maamle main nichle tabake ke logon ko bedakhal kar diya jaataa he
 Particularly lower caste women are affected because they have fewer rights even within their already marginalized communities
 yahi kaaran he ki unka kharaab aarthik sthiti se ubarna apni hi jati ke purushon ke mukaable mushkil ho jaataa he
 "we have seen examples of micro-credit in Bangladesh to help the lower classes," says Jomo Kwame Sundaram, Assistant secretary-general of the United Nations for economic development related matters
 aisi yojanaon ke jariye nichle tabake ke logon ko asthaayee taur par to madad mil jaati he lekin ham yah nahin kah sakate ki isse unki garibi dur ho jaati he
 "in the context of the large population of lower-class people living in South Asia and sub-saharan countries, he said that we suggest that some part of the plot can be given ownership of where the poor population is living
" iske baad ve us bhukhand ko rehan (mottges) rakhkar karj le sakate hai or apana kuch kaarobaar shuru kar sakate hai
 We can improve the condition of the people of the lower classes through such small methods

 syria ke al raai tivi ne kazzaphi ke hawaale se unki yah chetavanee prasaarit kii he
 Kajafi's statement comes at a time when rebels who occupied most parts of the country have extended the deadline for the surrender of Sirte by a week

 The meeting of the Lokpal Bill drafting committee between the government and the Gandhian Anna Hazare side was 'amicable' after a period of serious differences and bitter rhetoric
 haalanki, sarkaar ne jahaan baatcheet main badi pragati hone kaa daawa kiya, vahiin hazaare paksh ne kaha ki matbhed vaale muddon par ab tak aam sahmati nahin ban paayi he
 It is important for the meeting to be held in a 'cordial' atmosphere as the negotiations between the two sides had almost reached the verge of breakdown after serious differences emerged in the previous meeting
 baharhaal, somvaar ko kareeb teen ghante chali baithak ke baad maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantri kapil sibbal ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘‘hamaare bich bina kisi katutaa ke vistrut charchaa hui
 We consider this meeting a major step in the direction of the proposed Lokpal Bill
 baatcheet main badi pragati hui he
 About 80 to 85 percent of the provisions of the proposed draft bill have been finalized
 ’’unhone kaha, ‘‘kai muddon par donon pakshon ke bich vyapak talmail he
 The differences on which will be mentioned in the draft
 masauda samiti kii kal bhi baithak hogi jisamen donon paksh masaude ke apane-apane sanskaran ekadusre ko saunpenge
 Contrary to Sibal's claim, Arvind Kejriwal and Prashant Bhushan of the Hazare side said, "there has been no consensus on the issues on which there were earlier differences between the two sides
" prastaavit lokapal kii chayan prakriya or use hataane kii prakriya jaise do naye muddon par hamaare sarkaar ke saath matbhed ubhare hai
 However, both said that this meeting was 'cordial' as compared to earlier meetings
 sibbal ne kaha, ‘‘asahmati vaale ahm muddon ke saath taiyaar hone vaale masaude ko ham july main pradhanmantri manmohan singh dwaara bulaayi jane vaali sarvadaleey baithak main rakhenge
 We have decided that such important issues with differences should be decided through political process
 ’’unhone kaha ki isi aadhaar par ek majboot lokapal vidheyak kaa masauda taiyaar kiya jaayegaa, jise sansad ke monsoon satr main pesh karne se pehle manjuuri ke liye cabinet ke paas bheja jaayegaa
 He said that the 40 basic points of the Lokpal assigned to us by the Hazare side have been divided into various sections and most of them have been agreed upon
 haalanki, kejariwal ne kaha ki 40 main se 11 chote muddon par hi sahmati ban paayi he, lekin pradhanmantri pad, ucch nyaaypalika or sansad ke andar saansadon ke aacharan ko lokapal ke daayre main laane jaise vivaadaaspad muddon par ab bhi matbhed kaayam hai
 The issue of bringing the Prime Minister under the purview of Lokpal did not arise in this meeting
 is baithak main hazaare paksh kii ore se karnataka ke lokayukta santosh hegade ne bhaag nahin liya
 According to Kejriwal, the government said that the Prime Minister, Speaker of Lok Sabha, Leader of both Houses of Parliament and Leader of Opposition, Home Minister, Cabinet Secretary, a Judge of the Supreme Court and a Chief Justice of the High Court should be placed in the Lokpal Selection Committee
 unhone kaha ki hamane yah prastaav rakhaa tha ki lokapal kaa chayan ucchtam nyaayalay ke do nyaayadhish, do ucch nyaayalayon ke mukhya nyaayadhish, niyantrak or mahalekha pareekshak tathaa kendriya satarkta ayukta kii sadsyta vaali samiti kare
 Kejriwal said that the committee that the government is suggesting will be dominated by people in political and government positions
 lokapal ko hataane kii prakriya par bhi donon pakshon ke bich matbhed hai
 The RTI activist said that we had proposed that the common citizen should also be given the right to complain against the Lokpal in the Supreme Court
 haalanki, sarkaar ne kaha he ki lokapal ke khilaaf ucchtam nyaayalay main shikaayat daakhil karne kaa adhikaar sirf usee ke paas rahanaa chaiye
 He said that after the draft versions were exchanged in the final meeting of the committee to be held on Tuesday, both sides would send comments on it through correspondence
 sarkaar dwaara july main sarvadaleey baithak bulaaye jane ke faisle par kejariwal ne kaha, ‘‘ham iske khilaaf nahin he
 There should be an all party meeting
 ham bhi jald hi raajnneetik dalon se is mudde par samvaad saadhenge
 On why the Hazare side termed the discussion as "amicable" despite differences of opinion on key issues, Bhushan and Kejriwal said that our arguments were not heard in earlier meetings and the government only gave its verdict
 is baithak main donon pakshon ne barabari se apane mudde rakhe or charchaa ‘sabhy’ tareeke se hui
 On the questions of ensuring the integrity of the Lokpal, Kejriwal said that the CVC has 236 employees, some of whom may be corrupt
 lekin dilli metro ke saat hajaar karmiyon main railway se pratiniyukti par aaye karmi shaamil rahete hai or sabhi vishwa stareey metro sevaayen dete hai
 Kejriwal said that he e-head of the Delhi Metro
 shridharan se bhi baatcheet kii thi
 He said that we gave the example of Delhi Metro to the government and said that due to good system there is honesty and excellence
 jin muddon par kaayam he vivaad:abhi lokapal ke daayre main nyaaypalika ko rakhane par vivaad bana hua he
 Whether or not the PMO should be placed under the purview of the Lokpal was not discussed
 vahiin sarkaar ke sutron se mili khabar ke mutabik sarkaar civil seva ke adhikariyon ke khilaaf karrwai ke bhi khilaaf he
 It is also not agreed to give Lokpal a higher position than CBI and CVC
 sieji or chunaav ayog ke masale par bhi vivaad kaayam he
 On the issue of corruption, where civil society is demanding the punishment of life imprisonment, the government is entitled to a sentence of ten years
 vaigyanikon ko bhi shaamil karne ko lekar matbhed he

 1
 BJP will be reduced to 5 seats, if Rahul Gandhi meets akhilesh-mayawati: The overwhelming victory that the BJP won under the leadership of Narendra Modi in the Lok Sabha elections of MOTN2014 and the way the Congress was reduced to 44 seats, then the clear message was sent to the opposition parties
 That defeating BJP is not a matter of any single party
 yaheen se mahagathbandhan shabd astitv main aayaa jisaki pehali pariksha bihar main hui or argedy-jediu gathbandhan ne vidhansabha chunaav main jeet hasil kar ise paas bhi kar liya

 Priyanka Gandhi vadra: bahan priyanka kaa saath milte hi garaje rahul gandhi, kaha- UP main banaaenge apana cmlokasaba chunaav se thik pehle congress main nai urja kaa sanchaar hua he
 As soon as sister Priyanka Vadra formally enters the party, Congress President Rahul Gandhi is starting to roar
 unhone amethi main logon se milte hue kaha ki ve centre main narendra modi kii sarkaar ko ukhaad fekenge or upi main bhi apana mukhyamantri banaaenge

 yogi adityanaath kii parformens se upi vaale khush, 57% ne kiya likeindia today or karvi incits ke saath kiye gaye survey desh kaa mizaaj (mood of da nesan) main upi kii janata ne yogi adityanath sarkaar ke kaamkaaj par santosh jaahir kiya
 According to the survey, 57 percent of the people are very satisfied and satisfied with the functioning of the Yogi Adityanath government, while only 15 percent of the voters have expressed disappointment or great disappointment to the Yogi government
 27 fisadi aabaadi aisi he jo na to yogi sarkaar se santusht he or na hi niraash

 priyanka gandhi ke mahasachiv banate hi PM modi kaa riection- kuch logon ke liye parivaar hi partyloksabhaa chunaavon ke ain pehle desh kii raajnneeti main priyanka gandhi kii dastak par tamaam siyaasi halkon se pratikriya aa rahi he
 In a gesture on the entry of Priyanka Gandhi to the post of General Secretary in the Congress, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that for some people the family is the party, whereas the party is the family here
 unhone kaha ki desh ke kuch anya raajnneetik dal congress gotra ke hai
 So when we talk of Congress-free country, then we are opposed to the same culture
 mantriyon ke samooh ne balaatkaar virdohi kanoon kaa masauda taiyaar kar diya he or guuruuvaar ko ise cabinet main rakhaa ja rahaa he lekin balaatkaar ke khilaaf sakht kanoon ke naam par jis tarah se aapasi sahmati se sambandh banane kii umr 18 se 16 kiya gaya he us par sawaal khadey ho gaye hai
 Apart from this, the type of charges which have been made non-bailable may also be difficult
 matlab ab sarkaar ne sambandh banane ke liye vivaah yogya umr kii varjana todane kii taiyaari kar lee he
 Cannot get married in 16 years but will be able to have a relationship
 shaadi kii umr ladakon ke liye 21 saal he
 Abandon marriage, in 16 years, you cannot even see an adult category film but can make a relationship, in 16 years you cannot drink alcohol but can have a physical relationship
 ab dekhie he kis zurm par kitni sajaa he mantri samooh se paas kiye gaye anti rape kanoon main
 Life imprisonment for rape, life imprisonment for throwing acid, life imprisonment for rape by a minor, but what is shocking is that most of the crimes have been made non-bailable in this law
 matlab koi purush trephic jam main funs gaya ho or ittefaq se uski car kisi mahila kii car ke peeche ho to mahila usapar peechha karne kaa aarope laga sakati he or uski jamaanat nahin hogi
 Similarly, if you are trying to identify a woman and if the woman does not like it, then she can dial 100 number and get it inside
 agar koi purush kaam karte hue kisi mahila kii taraf bich-bich main dekh letaa he to wo gaiyr jamaanti aparaadh kaa bhagidaar he or police ke liye mahila kaa bayaan aakiri hoga
 The extent is that if the woman turns out to be false then no action will be taken against her
 cabinet se paas hone ke baad anti rape kanoon sarvadaleey baithak main rakhaa jayega or vahaan se sahmati asahmati ke baad sansad main lekin sawaal he ki is kanoon main bachaav kii niyat zyaada he yaa bhay kii bhoomika

 On the other hand, radioactive radiation at the Fukushima nuclear plant, located 240 km from Tokyo, has reached the legal limit
 japan ke mukhya cabinet sachiv yokio inaado ne kaha ki phukushima parmaanu sanyantr sankhya ek main prasheetak tantra (kooling system) band hone se paidaa hui sthiti se nipatane ke liye jaruri prayaas kiye ja rahe hai
 Inado said at a press conference on Sunday that in order to reduce pressure and temperature in the plant's units, some amount of radioactive steam is being pumped out and the water supply in the units is being ensured if these measures are successfully completed
 Plants will be made safe if gone
 isse pehle sanyantr kii sanchaalak tokyo electric power company ne sarkaar ko sanyantr sankhya ek kii ikai sankhya teen main bhi apaat sthiti kii soochna di thi
 Inado stated that radioactive steam being taken out of the plant is dangerous to human health
 isliye sanyantr ke aasapaas paas ke ilaake ko khaali kara liya gaya he
 He said that there are now only 114 people in the radius of 10 km whereas the work of displacing 1,80,000 people within the radius of 10 to 20 km was started on Sunday morning
 iske alaava phukushima ke parmaanu sanyantr sankhya do ke aasapaas ke teen kilometre ke daayre ko bhi khaali kara liya gaya he or 10 se 20 kilometre ke daayre main rah rahe 30,000 se zyada logon ko visthapit karne kaa kaam ravivaar subah shuru kiya gaya

 In such a situation, a video of the jawans has appeared in which he is showing that there is so much cold that his juices, eggs and vegetables are frozen and even after breaking with a hammer, he has to struggle a lot
 yah video soshal media par viral ho gaya he
 Three army personnel are present in the video
 sabase pehle ek jawan fruit zeus kaa dabba kholkar dikhaata he joki thand kii vajah se jam gaya he or hathaudaa maarane par bhi tut nahin rahaa
 Apart from this, egg and potato are also in the same condition
 thand kii vajah se ye bhi jam gaye hai or hathode kaa prayod karne par bhi tut nahin rahe
 An army soldier is seen saying that such frozen eggs are found on the mountains
 iske baad javaanon ne jame hue tamaato, pyaaj, aalu or adarak ko bhi video main todane kii koshish kii lekin vah naakaam rahe
 a jawan told that the temperature here goes below 70
 soshal media par viral video main is baat kii jhalak dekhi ja sakati he ki duniya ke sabase oonche yuddh ke maidan main sainikon ko har roj kitni mushkilon kaa saamana karnaa hota he
 In the video, three soldiers can be seen breaking open tetra packs of fruit juice, and even after breaking it, only snow comes out
 uske baad ve bataate hai ki zeus pine ke liye unhen use ubaalana padataa he
 The video also shows that if you are in Siachen, breaking is common
 sainik bataate hai ki unhen andey todane ke liye hathode kii jarurat padati he
 One Twitter user wrote, "what a difficult season our soldiers face in Siachen
 ise tathakthith liberlon or secularon ko bhejein, jo bhartiya sena kaa manobal giraane kaa koi mauka nahin chhodte
 "another user wrote," Oh my god it's so sad
 
 Salute to our brave and capable Siachen soldiers

 "(input: IANS) party ke liye apane dwaara kiye gaye kaamon kaa zikr karte hue unhone kaha, 'varsh 1982 main main bhi ek aise antim pankti main baitha karata tha
 This is a great party that gives the poster person a chance to become the president
 ' pradhanmantri narendra modi kii ore ishaara karte hue shah ne kaha, 'garib se garib parivaar main janm lene vaale chaay vaale kaa betaa sabase bade loktantr kaa naam vishwa main roshan kar rahaa he
 This is possible only in BJP and not in any other party
 ' Referring to the work he has done for the party, he said, 'in the year 1982, i used to sit in one such last row
 yah vah mahaan party he jo poster chipkaane vaale ko bhi adhyaksh banane kaa mauka detii he
 Pointing to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Shah said, "the son of a tea-born born from the poorest of the poor is illuminating the name of the largest democracy in the world

 ' gauratlab he supreme court ne pichley saal 20 march ko die gaye faisle main essi-asti kanoon ke durupyog par chintaa jataate hue disha nirdesh jari kiye the
 The Supreme Court said that the SC-ST Prevention of Atrocities Act will not register a case immediately after receiving a complaint
 dspi pehle shikaayat kii praarambhik jaanch karke pataa lagayegaa ki maamla jhootha yaa durbhaavna se prerit to nahin he
 Apart from this, the accused will not be arrested immediately after the FIR is registered in this law
 court ne kaha tha ki sarkari karmchaaree kii giraftaar se pehle sakasham adhikari or saamaanya vyakti kii giraftaar se pehle esaspi kii manjuuri lee jaaegi
 Not only this, the court had also opened the way for anticipatory bail of the accused
 iske baad sarkaar essi-asti sanshodhan kaa nayaa kanoon 2018 main le ai
 Advocates Prithviraj Chauhan and Priya Sharma have filed a petition in the Supreme Court against this
 supreme court main daayar yachika main kaha gaya he ki supreme court ke 20 march ke aadesh ko kiya jaae lagu
 Implementation of new provision 18A in the new law 2018 added through SC-ST amendment will then lead to immediate arrest in the case of torturing Dalits and will not be able to get anticipatory bail
 yachika main nae kanoon ko asanvaidhanik ghoshit karne kii maang kii gai he
 The SC-ST Amendment Act 2018 was passed by the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha and has been notified
 raashtrapati kii manjuuri milane ke baad sanshodhan kanoon prabhavi ho gaya he
 Today's Judgment will have no effect at present as the Supreme Court's decision was nullified by passing the amended law in Parliament
 ek taraf jahaan lalu prasad yadav kii sajaa ko lekar charchaa ho rahi he
 On the other hand, the national vice president of his party Shivanand Tiwari is engaged in raising the issue of reservation in the judiciary
 unka kahana he ki unch nyaaypalika main aarakshan hona chahie
 Shivanand Tiwari says that we have raised a theoretical question, there should be reservation in the higher judicial
 kyonki raashtrapati ne bhi kaha tha ki samaaj ke har tabake kaa cheharaa hair judishiri main dikhaai nahin de rahaa he
 Which is a matter of concern for us
 iske pehle bhi keaar narayanan bhi is vishay ko uthaa chuke hai
 When Karia Munda was a member of the Lok Sabha from the Bharatiya Janata Party, a committee of the Justice Department was formed under her chairmanship
 isi baat par vichaar karne ke liye kisupreme courtor hoicourt ke jajon kii niyukti main aarakshan kaa praavdhaan hona chahie yaa nahin
 i have a copy of the report which was dedicated to the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha in the month of March 2000
 shivanand tiwari ne kaha ki unka maananaa he ki dalit adivasee or pichhadon ko aarakshan milanaa chahie
 We are also working in this matter
 is par baat karte hue unhone kaha ki ek sawaal logon ke dimag main aa rahaa he ki chaara ghotaalaa maamle main lalu yadav ko olerady 5 saal kii sajaa ho chuki he 
 It has also been debarred from contesting elections
 ab phir vahi maamle main aaj sajaa kaa elaan hone vaala he
 Tomorrow will be the second again, the day after tomorrow it will be the third, it is absolutely against the constitution
 samvidhan kii dhara 20 (2) kahata he ki kisi vyakti ko ek aparaadh ke liye to dand nahin mil saktaa
 In this case there is protection of the constitution
 isi aadhaar par ranchi hoicourt ne jajment diya tha
 Whatever the case of Larger Conspiracy, Lalu Yadav and other accused should be considered as one and they have been punished on the basis of this
 uske baad isamen aage koi dand kaa praavdhaan nahin banataa
 But now this matter has gone to court
 vahaan jaj ne kaha he ki sunwaayee alag-alag hi hogi
 On raising the issue of reservation in the judiciary of Shivanand Tiwari on the occasion of Ann Judgment, the Janata Dal has said that it is Ribd's Vibhishan
 iskaa jawaab dete hue unhone kaha ki yah to lalu yadav tay karenge
 Not Nitish Kumar or Sushil Modi
 lalu yadav ko hamaare upar vishwaas he
 Now what does it matter what someone says
 vaise bhi hamaare bolne yaa naa bolne se faisle par koi asar nahin padane vaala
 He will give the punishment that the court has to give
 shivanand tiwari ne kaha ki hamane ek bada saidhantik sawaal uthaaya he
 And with this we will go among the public
 dalit samaaj ke logon ke man main nishchit rup se yah sawaal uthaa he
 They do not know what is the technical difference in the case of Jagannath Mishra and Lalu Yadav
 log sirf yah jaanate hai ki donon ek hi maamle main abhiyukt he
 And one man is released and another is in jail
 jo dalit samaaj ke log hai vah sadiyon se yah khel dekh rahe hai
 Shivanand Tiwari further said that now you should make him technical that Lalu was the Chief Minister and Jagannath Mishra was not the Chief Minister
 humlog is sawaal ko janata ke bich lekar jaaenge
 Those who are speaking Bhasmasura also have a chance
 jo ladaai 1990 main shuru hui thi vah adhuri rah gai thi jise lekar ab ham janata ke bich main jaaenge

 It appears that Rahul has been forcibly sent on leave

 tyoharon ke maukey par upi or bihar jane vaali trainon main yatriyon ko ho rahi baari pareshaaniyon kii khabar enditivi india par lagaataar dikhaae jane ke baad railway ne aaj do atirikt trainen chalaane kaa faisla kiya he
 Both trains are unreserved and will open from Anand Vihar railway station to Patna via Kanpur, Allahabad, Mughalsarai, Buxar, Dumraon, Ara
 enditivi india ne dikhaaya tha ki conform tikat hone ke baavjood yatri kis tarah toilet main safar karne ko majaboor hai, kyonki dibbe main itani bheed he ki ve apni seat tak nahin pahunch sakate
 Despite the confirmed ticket, many of those who cannot get into the sleeper compartment, many passengers are going in the AC coaches, but allegations are also being made that the employees are forcing the people into the AC compartment with money
 shuukravaar shaam ko enditivi ke samvaadadaata ko arpeef ke karmchaariyon ne bataaya ki unako yahaan par shoot karne kii ijaajat nahin he
 It is clear that the Railways have instead raised their hands to find a solution and have left the people on their side
 tyoharon ke is mausam main train tikaton ke daam aise bad rahe hai, jaise hawaii jahaaj ke tikat hon or jis daleel ke saath kiraayon main badhotaree kii ja rahi he ki suvidhaon main behatari hogi, dallalon se mukti milegi, lekin aisa kuch najar nahin aa rahaa
 If someone is paying something for the same ticket, someone is paying something else
 aam logon kii haalat aisi ki toilet main baith kar safar karne ko majaboor hai

 '' The echo of the 84-kosi Parikrama of the World Hind Council was heard from the road to the Parliament today
 jahaan ek taraf sadakon par viechpi kaaryakartaaon ne virodh pradarshan kiya
 At the same time, there was a fierce debate in the Lok Sabha between Samajwadi Party supremo Mulayam Singh and BJP MP Yogi Adityanath
 pehle mulaayam singh ne bijepi dangon ke liye maahaul banane kaa aarope lagaaya or kaha ki bijepi vaale gundai par utar aae hai
 They neither believe the court nor the constitution
 iske jawaab main bijepi netaa yogi adityanath ne kaha ki mulaayam singh kis samaajwaad kii baat karte hai
 He is the president of the party himself, two brothers are the general secretaries, the son is the chief minister and so what socialism is this
 yah to vishuddh parivaarwaad he
 Socialism is being stripped of secularism in the name
 bijepi dange karana chaahati haih mulaayam singh yadav'ayodhya kaa vivaad aaj se nahin 1950 se bhi pehle se chalaa aa rahaa he
 Is subjudice bijepi ne 1992 main aisa maahaul banaaya ki desh bhar main dange hue
 BJP is doing the same thing again
 bijepi court ko maanati nahin, samvidhan ko nahin maanati
 The Supreme Court decided that the status quo should remain in Ayodhya
 jab tak us par koi antim faisla naa aa jaae
 But the BJP people want to be arbitrary
 kisi bhi viechpi kaaryakarta kii pitayee nahin hui
 Actually, this journey did not get the support of the public
 is yatra main ek bhi janata shaamil nahin hai
 People and saints have also condemned this visit
 hamaari sarkaar court ke aadesh kaa paalan kar rahi he
 BJP people are protesting yahaan aakar hamaare daftar main todphod kii gai
 BJP people have come on Gundai
 baat karte hai bhrashtachar kii or maanavtaa kii
 We know how to stop hooliganism
 hamane 1990 main bhi roki thi
 If you are arbitrary, you will face punishment
 upi sarkaar ne court ke nirdesh kaa paalan kiya he
 We did nothing wrong
 'iske baad jawaab main bijepi kii ore se yogi adityanath utre
 Adityanath, denying the fundamental right to religious freedom, said that the whole country is being misled on this issue
 ayodhya main teen tarah kii yatraaen hoti he
 According to the same tradition, 84 kosi circumambulation was decided in Kumbh Mela among 10 thousand saints
 yah vishuddh dharmik yatra thi
 200-250 saints were to walk in it
 lekin jis tarah dharmik swatantraaa ke moulik adhikaar kaa hanan upi sarkaar ne kiya
 It is condemnable
 desh ke 2000 santon ko giraftaar kiya
 Saints and saints were insulted
 sadhu santon dwaara mandir kii maang karnaa koi paap he kyaadityanath ke mutabik rahi baat ayodhya main bhavy mandir kii to 1994 main congress nit sarkaar ne hi supreme court main shapath patr diya tha ki agar yah siddh ho jaataa he ki vivaadit dhaancha par pehle mandir tha to hindu samaaj kii bhaawanaaon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue vahaan mandir kaa nirmaan kiya jayega

 So is it a sin to demand a temple by sage saints? mulaayam kaa samaajwaad vishuddh parivaarwaad hamulaayam singh par nishaanaa sadhate hue adityanath ne kaha ki mulaayam kis samaajwaad kii baat karte hai

 NDTV India has received some important information about the Santro car Delhi Police is looking for in connection with the blast in Delhi High Court
 yah car dhamaake se pehle kal subah paanch bajkar 35 minute par indira gandhi airport ke terminal thri par gai thi
 Meanwhile, security cameras at the airport captured pictures of the car and its driver
 enditivi idia ke paas ye tasviren hai
 Photographs by NDTV show that the driver is a 22–23 year old young man with a dark complexion, thick black hair and a mustache
 is driver ne safed rang kii shart pahan rakhi thi
 According to airport records, the car also went there on 10 and 14 July
 haalanki dilli police kaa kahana he ki car faridabad se mili he, lekin iskaa hoicourt main hue dhamaake se koi lenadena nahin he
 Can someone sleep on it by keeping the corpse under their bed? Can someone stay in the same room for hours with a corpse? Can cook Can watch tv All these questions are very strange
 lekin dilli ke ek prem trikon main katl kii kahani kuch aisi hi he
 In a love in which a couple first murders a girl and then spent the entire 36 hours with her corpse
 katl kii hairaan karne vaali kahanesva arab kii aabaadi vaale apane mulk main har roj amuman sau logon kaa katl hota he
 But such a story of murder is not usually seen
 ek aisi kahani jisamen katl ke baad katilalash ke sathek hi kamare main puure 36 ghante tak rahe
 Slept with the same corpse, woke up with the same corpse, cooked the same corpse and ate the same corpse
 bore main band mili thi ladki kii laashais rongte khadey karanevaali kahani kii shuruyaat shuukravaar 29 july ko hui
 When a corpse was thrown in a closed sack in this alley of East Delhi's Shakarpur area in the dark of night
 subah hui to gali ke bich padi is bori ko dekh kar logon ko anhoni kaa andaja lagaate der nahin lagi, phir to fouran police kaa ittila di gai or agle chand minuton main police bhimauka-e-vaardatpar maujuud thi, ye ek ladki kii laash thi
 There was a problem in identifying the corpse but since it was a case of blind murder
 police ne laash kii pahchaan pataa karne se hi tafteesh kii shuruyaat karne kaa faisla kiya
 But the problem was that the slayer had severely crushed the face of the corpse
 aise main laash kii pahchaan mumkin nahin thi
 So, till some other clue is found, the police decided to send the corpse for postmortem
 ab dilli police kii alag-alag timen ek saath kai theories par kaam karne lagi
 a team of police was engaged in identifying the girl, while the rest of the teams were tracing the murderers with the help of their intelligence sources
 lekin isi dauraan police ko us ilaake main kai aise makaanon kaa pataa chalaa, jahaan rahane vaale log is laash ke milane ke aasapaas ke dinon se hi apane-apane gharon se baahar gaye hue the
 The girl used to live in a rented house, in which the police immediately started verification of all these people
 is koshish main police ko baakiyon kaa to pataa chal gaya, lekin paas hi ek makaan main rahanevaale ek jode ke bare main kisi ko koi jaankaree nahin thi
 The couple lived in a rented house
 jo ittefaq se usee 29 july se gaayab tha, jis roj subah gali main laash padi mili thi, to kya is laash or katl ke peeche yahi joda tha? jaahir he, is sawaal kaa jawaab jaanane ke liye is kapal tak pahunchnaa jaruri tha
 The accused confessed to the crime
 Now the police questioned the landlord and soon the couple living there was identified
 ye joda firoz or uski garlfriend suman urf puja tha
 Feroz used to work in the hotel while his girlfriend Suman was a waitress and dancer
 ab police ne sari takat in donon ko dhundne main jhonk di or is koshish kaa phayda bhi hua, jald hi purvi dilli se police ne firoz or suman ko pakad liya
 But before the police interrogate the two, they both confess to having their hands in the murder
 satta ke shikhar se girnaa loktantr main ek aam baat he
 Failure of any established thing is its fate
 lekin shame or niraadar ke andhkaar main girnaa bilkul alag baat
 The Congress party lost to corruption and poor administration, but the situation became embarrassing for them as the party's heads remained submerged

 bihar ke mukhyamantri or purv railmantri nitish kumaar ne varsh 2012-13 ke rail bajet ko niraashajanak or khaali dibba samaan bataaya he
 Nitish told reporters, "there is nothing in the railway budget, everything about safety is in the 'future tense' and what will we do next?" nitish ne kaha ki rajg shasankaal ke dauraan unke rail mantritvakaal main 2003-13 kaa ek kaperarat sefti fund or ek kaperarat sefti plan banaaya gaya tha
 What has been done on that corporate safety plan has been deliberately silenced because the safety of the railways during the tenure of the UPA government has not been taken care of and the result is that the condition of the railway is bad today and accidents have started to rise again
 unhone kaha ki jab inako mauka mila railway suraksha par dhyaan nahin diya, kaarykaal kaa aakhri vakt aa rahaa he to yah ‘future tence’ main sari baat kar rahe hai jiskaa koi matlab nahin he
 He said that this will not create any hope in the mind of the rail user or the person who knows the railway
 unhone kaha ki rail mantri ko 1
 After listening for 50 hours and minutes, it felt that there is a need to speak more because there is nothing to say
 nitish ne kaha ki rail mantri kaa bhaashan sunakar unhen bahut hi niraashaa hui, hamaari apeksha thi ki vah suraksha ke masale kii thik se vyakhya karenge or railway kii jo lambit pariyojnaayen hai usapar dhyaan kendrit karenge
 He said that the slow pace at which the railway project in Bihar is being worked out suggests that there is either discrimination against this state and or if this condition is for the entire country, then it is a sign of bad situation
 nitish ne railway bajet ko niraashajanak bataate hue kaha ki isamen aam aadmi ke liye kuch nahin he or rail upyogkarta ko koi raahat nahin mili he

 "it is quite worrying that 135 patents had been done on Yogasanas in the US five years ago," Gupta says
 ab inaki sankhya 150 se adhik hogi
 There have been two thousand trademarks and 150 copyrights on Yogasan itself
 yoga vidya bharat ke paaramparik or pracheen gyaan par aadhaarit he or anya deshon main iske patent, trademark or copirite hona durbhagyapurna he
 "he said," The first mention of Yogasanas is found in the Patanjali Yoga Sutra, which was composed two thousand years ago
 ab hamaare samaksh chunauti yah he ki ham hamaare gyaan ko duusare deshon-companiyon kii ore se patent karaaye jane ke is chalan ko majbootee se roke
 "gupta said," We are now preparing videography of about 900 Yogasanas

 He said that in TKDL we have done a lot of work on Ayurveda, Unani and Siddha science
 ab hamane yoga par dhyaan kendrit kiya he taaki bhavishya main yogasana ko duusare deshon main companiyon dwaara patent karaane kii koshishon ko naakaam kar saken
 It is said that 250 claims for patenting of Yogasanas are still pending in the US and European patent offices
 tikadiel jo 900 yogasana kii videography kar unhen digital swaroop pradaan kar rahaa he, unamem do hajaar varsh puraane patanjali yoga sutara, bhagavad gita, ashtaang hriday, hath pradipika, gherand samhita, shiv samhita or sandra satkarm jaise granthon se sandarbh liye gayi hai
 Asked if India would try to revoke the already patented Yogasana after doing videography and providing access to the US and European patent offices, Gupta said, "for this we need to look at the legal and economic aspect Because it is not so easy to fight patent cases internationally
 ’’ unhone kaha ki phir bhi bharat kii ore se puri koshish hogi
 At the same time, the maximum emphasis will be focused on whether efforts should be made to patent Yogasan in future

 whatsapp ne kiya conform, kaha bhartiya patrakaron kii jasusi kar rahaa tha Pegasus
 Israeli company has prepared this spyware
 kaaphi pehle hamane aapako ek israeli agency dwaara banaae gaye Pegasus naam ke spiware ke bare main bataaya tha
 Then there was this news through which journalists and activists are targeted
 ab whatsapp ne ye conform kar diya he ki ye spiware bharat main bhi active tha or yahaan ke logon kii bhi jasusi kar rahaa tha
 whatsapp has told Indian Express that Indian journalists and human rights activists were the target of this spying, although the company has not told how many Indian people have been spied through this spyware
 chunki Pegasus kaa istemaal koi aam shaks nahin kar saktaa he or ise NSO Group ne sarkaron ke liye banaaya gaya he
 The big question is, who used it to spy on Indian journalists and human rights activists? Or who gave the green signal for its use? This spyware named Pegasus has been in India for a long time and people have been spied from time to time
 isroyal kii NSO Group ne ise saraakaaron ke liye dizin kiya he taaki jarurat padane par company kii sahaayta lekar Pegasus ke jariye jasusi kii ja sake
 Significantly, whatsapp has sued the Israeli agency NSO Group in the US Federal Court yesterday
 watsap ne iljaam ye lagaaya he ki NSO group apane Pegasus naam ke spiware ke jariye 1400 whatsapp yugers ko torget kiya he or unki jasusi kii he
 Now it is not clear how many of these Indians were there
 lekin aisa nahin he ki ye Pegasus naam kaa spiware sirf watsap yugers kii hi jasusi kar saktaa he
 This is better dangerous and it can also access your cloud accounts
 Pegasus behad khatarnaak he or delit hone ke baad bhi kaam karata he!pegasus ek Spyware he or ise isroyal kii agency ne taiyaar kiya he
 It can access data from Facebook, Google Drive and icloud
 Financial Times kii ek report ke mutabik is company kaa ye tul kisi yujar ke cloud besd acount acces karne kii kshamta rakhata he
 The NSO group has designed this tool named Pegasus in such a way that it can copy and access the data authentication key of Google Drive or icloud
 itnaa hi nahin ye tul Facebook massenger bhi acces kar saktaa he
 The way to do this is that once your smartphone is affected by this spyware, just understand that it will download your entire history from your cloud account
 history yani aapaki puri online history
 This spyware named Pegasus is so dangerous that it continues to affect user accounts despite authentication being invalidated
 aap ise duusari companiyon kii kamajori bhi kah sakate hai
 According to the report, these companies prepare for such software agencies, including government agencies
 ye software yaa tul Android or iphone donon main hi kaam karata he
 According to the report, this tool accesses cloud data uploaded from laptop, tablet or smartphone
 agar is software ko torget smartphone se hataa diya jaeg phir bhi ye kaam karnaa jari rakhata he

 Laal Kaptaan Teaser: The teaser of Bollywood actor Saif Ali Khan's upcoming film 'lal Kaptan' has exploded as soon as it is released
 'laal captain (laal Kaptaan)' ke is jabardast tiger ko dekhakar lag rahaa he ki saf ali khan ek baar phir parde par dhamal machaane vaale hai
 In the teaser of the film 'laal Kaptaan', Saif Ali Khan has adopted the look of Sadhu, as well as Saif Ali Khan's style in the video is quite different from the rest of his films
 'laal captain (laal Kaptaan)' ke tiger main sadhu bane saf ali khan (saif Ali Khan) kah rahe hai "har ram kaa apana ravan or har ram kaa apana dashahra
 "in the video, Saif Ali Khan's look with a turban on the head, ashes on his face and red eyes looks very strong
 khaas baat to yah he ki iroj nau ke you-tub channel par relies 'laal captain' ke tiger ko ab tak ek lakh se bhi zyada baar dekha ja chukaa he
 Seeing this attitude of Saif Ali Khan in the video, people are also praising him a lot
 bataa den ki saf ali khan (saif Ali Khan) kii apakaming film 'laal captain (laal Kaptaan)' kaa tiger unke janmdin ke maukey par hi relies hua tha
 His film is based on the revenge drama
 navdeep singh ke nirdesan main taiyaar ho rahi is film ko anand el raay produs kar rahe hai
 The film has been produced under the banner of Eros International
 saf ali khan kii yah film 11 oktober, 2019 ko cinemagharon main dhamal machayegi
 Rating: 2 Star Artist: Shah Rukh Khan, Kajol, Varun Dhawan, Kriti Sanon, Director: Rohit Shettiham Sharif What happened the world went rogue
 
 
 yah'dilavaale'kaa shahrukh kaa vah dialog he, jisane film ke trailor ko hit banane main ahm role adaa kiya tha
 Expectations were raised
 lekin film dekhakar yahi laga ki shahrukh aap rohit shetty ke baari-bharkam record par kya mar-mite filmon ko lekar aapaki chois hi gadabada gai
 There is also a point that when our superstars are entering the 50th year of age, they should not be trying to revive their two-three decade old avatars
 isiilie 'dar', 'baazeegar', 'chak de
 
 ' jaisi behtareen filmein dene vaale shahrukh khan ko ab apane 'raaj' avatar se nikalne kii koshish kerani chahie
 Then Rohit Shetty's overconfidence also appears in this film
 isliye kahani kii bajaay vah oonchi-lambii kaaron par zyada jor dete dikh
 The comedy side was also weak this time
 is hafte relies hui 'bajirao mastaani' ko dekhne ke baad'dilavaale'ko dekhnaa kuch aisa hi he jaise desi ghi kaa jaayakedaar khaanaa khaane ke baad kaduve tel kii mithai khaanaa
 How much Damsharukh (raj) and Kajol (meera) meet in the story and then both get tied up in Ishq's door
 vah mafia parivaar se hai
 The love of both is rising, but something happens that both of them are separated
 pandrah saal baad phir se in do diwaanon kii kahani shuru hoti he
 This time Shahrukh and Kajol's siblings Varun (veer) and Kriti (ishita) play an important role in furthering this story
 varun or kriti main pyaar hoga to bade bhai bahan kaise chhot jaaenge
 In this way, the lovers who fall apart collide again
 lekin bulgaria se kahani goa tak pahunch chuki hoti he
 The story of the film is something that it seems that after seeing many films, took ideas from them and put them in the mixie and made a new formula
 lekin yah formula yaa shaike puri tarah se beswad he
 Star appeals Shah Rukh Khan looks good, but his bearded look is more fun, and he is very much into action
 unke vanaliner mjedaar hai
 He has only a slightly stronger side of this weak story
 jahaan tak batkajolki he to vah film main bahut hi ausat lagi hai or ab vah simran jaisaa kamaal karti kahin najar nahin aati he
 Of course, Shah Rukh of fifty and Kajol's pair of 40 now no longer hold the same magic as before
 phir varun dhawan sirf chote bhai hi banakar rah gaye hai
 Varun should think before doing such a weak character
 vahiin kriti sinan kaaphi ummiden jagaati hai, film main unke karne ke liye kuch nahin he
 Sanjay Mishra tickles but Baman Irani is boring
 kamai kii batshahrukhsaal bhar baad laute hai lekin ghisi-pity kahani ke saath
 Of course he spent Rs 100 crore
 se zyada kii apni is film kii tufaani marketing kii he or film ko kaamyaab banane ke liye puri shiddat se mehnat bhi kii he
 Prior to this, his film 'happy New Year' was also very weak in terms of story, but the film did well
 dilavaale bhi kahani or anya morchon par bahut ummid nahin jagaati he
 But such films are only damaging Shahrukh's image
 yah baat saaf he ki box offis par bahut bade chamatkaar karne kii 'dilavaale' kii raah main'bajirao mastaani'sabase bada roda he
 After Rahul Gandhi, now Sonia Gandhi has attacked the Modi government
 sonia gandhi ne piem narendra modi par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki jabase bijepi kii sarkaar satta main ai he tabase desh main danga bad gaya he
 Rahul Gandhi also made the same allegations on the BJP government a few days ago
 sonia gandhi ne kaha, 'nai sarkaar banane ke 11 hafton ke andar desh main khaskar upi or maharashtra main sampradayik hinsa ke maamle teji se bade hai
 Within a very short time, 600 cases of communal violence have been reported in some other states including UP, Maharashtra
 'is bayaan ke jawaab main kendriya mantri vankeya naidu ne kaha ki sampradayik hinsa sabase zyada upi main badi he
 There is a SP government that has always supported the Congress
 sonia gandhi ne hameshaa hi sapa kaa samarthan kiya he
 The Congress itself has been involved in communal violence and is now doing politics
 vot bank kii raajnneeti kaa nateeja congress bhugat chuki he
 While there, Dr
 harshavardhan ne tippanee se manaa kar diya
 He said that there is no need to respond to feedback on every leader's statement
 raajnneeti nahin honi chahie, police ko kaam karne dena chahie, bheed dwaara na hatya ruk rahi he or na aisi ghatnaon par sawaal uthaane ke baad die jane vaale aise naitik sandesh ruk rahe hai
 It is being presented in such a way that all this is an incident outside the realm of political and hate thinking which is a problem of law and order
 agar he bhi to bhi alvar main ek saal pehle bhi pahalu khan kii hatya hui thi
 Has anyone been proved guilty
 jinhen pakadaa gaya ve sab bari ho chuke hai
 Why two people are killed in Alwar within a year
 kyon in donon ke naam pahalu khan or rakabar khan hai
 On July 17, the Supreme Court had also made a strong comment on mob violence, and had laid down the entire structure of accountability of how the police would work in such a case, the Supreme Court would not have to do so strictly if the police were working
 ek mantri hatya karne vaali bheed ke aarope main ucch adaalat se zamaanat par chhot kar aate hai or centre sarkaar ke mantri unhen maala pahanaate hai, ve nishchit rup se raajnneeti nahin kar rahe the, balki ulta police ko kaam karne de rahe the
 Politics has no shortage of logic and sophistication
 kisi ko nahin bakhsha jayega tip ke bayaan se kuch hota nahin he, balki ant main pakade gaye log bhi baksh die jate hai or ve bhi bakhshae hue maan liye jate hai jinhen pakadaa bhi nahin jaataa he
 Did Alwar's police delay Rakbar to the hospital and whether police killed Rakbar after putting him in his car, a woman reported that Rakbar was hitting Rakbar in the car
 12 baj kar 41 minute par police ko soochna milti he ki bheed ne kisi ko maaraa he
 You heard that the police station is 15-20 minutes away from the scene, yet the police takes thirty to forty minutes to reach
 naval kishor ne police ko soochna di thi, naval vishwa hindu parishad kaa kaaryakarta he or gau raksha ko lekar kaam karata he
 Police went to the scene about Naval itself
 ab aap dekhie, sava baje police ghatnasthal se rakabar ko uthaati he magar 4 kimi dur aspataal pahunchane main teen ghante lag jate hai
 The police reach Rakbar at four o'clock
 teen ghante kyon lage, yah jaananaa behad zaruri he, kyon police ko teen ghante lage
 Harsha Kumari Singh has seen both FIR copy and hospital records in which there is a considerable difference
 exiaar me likhaa he ki rakabar kaa sharir mitti se dhanka tha
 Hospital records say Rakbar's body was clean
 sharir par koon ke nishaan nahin the
 There was no soil
 kya police bheed yaa uske kisi sargana ko bachaane kaa prayaas kar rahi thi, jab rakabar mitti se sanaa tha, khun se lathpath tha to police ne turant aspataal kyon nahin pahunchaaya, use maukey par nahala kar kyon saaf kiya, jab vah aspataal pahunchaa to mitti ke nishaan nahin the
 His body was clean
 kya aisa karne se saboot nahin mite honge
 Harsha Kumari Singh spoke to Naval Kishore
 aap naval kii ek ek baat ko dhyaan se padhie
 'reached something at 1
15
 12
 It must have been 41 minutes
 ek 15 se 20 ke bich pahunch gaye
 You pulled out, there, Madan Lal Bhai of the Koli Samaj of my village is the same Dharmendra who has been accused by the police, the police have kept him as a perpetrator, bathed Permit with a bucket of water
 tasalli dilaai
 Wanted to transport the cow also
 aaf nikal gaye
 Tea is drunk before the police station
 mohan ji ne kaha tha ki gaay lekar aa rahe the
 It is dark with the police station
 wo bilkul feet tha
 There was a pain in the leg
 baat bhi achche se kar rahaa tha, puure bayaan police ko khud die hai
 Elsewhere, no pain was told
 police ne apni baaten poochin to usne sari jaankaree di he
 Both those boys were also with whom Rakbar did not tell anything
 ham aae the jane ke time tha 3 baje kaa
 Take an hour or so
 do baje thane par pahunche
 Stayed at the police station for one hour
 chaar baje ham gaye the
 Was fit waapas jab aae to mrit mila
 ' naval kishor ne aaj rakabar kii ek tasviir bhi jari kii jo usne police kii gaadi ke andar hi lee
 This picture is taken after removing mud from Naval Kishore's body and bathing him
 kya is tasviir ko dekhakar aapako lag rahaa he ki rakabar kii haalat itani karaab thi ki wo kuch der main dam tod detaa
 Rakbar died or was killed
 kya is tasviir se yah sawaal nahin uthta he
 Rakbar could have been an important witness, especially after the Supreme Court guidelines
 naval is maamle main ab ek ahm gavaah he
 Rakbar was fine when Naval Kishore goes to the cowshed with cows at three o'clock, and was having a good conversation, Rakbar is found dead when Naval returns
 is baat kii jaanch honi chahie ki jab naval gaay lekar gaushala chalaa gaya tha tab police ne uskaa intazaar kyon kiya
 Why did she not reach hospital directly with Rakbar
 naval is baat se hairaan he ki jin logon ko usne ghatnasthal par rukne ke liye bolaa, dharmendra or paramjeet unhen arest kar liya he
 Both of them were also in the jeep with Rakbar
 rakabar ne inaki pahchaan nahin kii or na hi in donon ke bare main kuch kaha
 Paramjit's brother also said that if he was involved in the killing crowd then why would he inform the police
 bheed kisi ko maar rahi he, police maukey par pahunch jaati he, bheed kaa peechha nahin karti he, ghayal ko uthaati he, tab shaayad uske man main pehali baat hogi ki ghayal kii jaan zaruri he, tab police use lekar naval ke gaanv kyon jaati he, kyonki police gaay ko gaushala bhejne ke liye gaadi ke intazaam main lagi thi
 Now his priority becomes cow instead of injured
 isi jagah par naval kii chachee ne dekha ki police jeep main kisi ko maar rahi he
 Maya, who is Naval's aunt, saw the police kicking Rakbar
 magar tab tak rakabar zindaa he uski cheekh se pataa chalata he
 Later, when Naval leaves the police car, Rakbar is still alive and talking to the police himself
 naval ke gaanv se police nikalati he do baje raat ko
 On the way, we stop for tea
 govindgarh mode par chaay vaale se chaar cap chaay banane ke liye kahati he
 Rakbar complains of pain here
 police aspataal lekar nahin jaati he, use thana lekar jaati he
 It is here that at 3 o'clock, a Naval carriage is carried to the cowshed
 15 kimi dur
 When he returns in an hour, he sees that Rakbar is dead
 jo aadmi ghayal ho, jo marane kii sthiti main ho, use police lekar ja rahi ho to kya police chaay pine ke liye rukegi
 'police goes to police station from Govindgarh, Rakbar is still moaning
 aspataal ek kimi kii duuri par he thane se
 But it is 4 o'clock on reaching and Rakbar dies
 jab pahunchataa he tab vah mara hua tha
 The police went to the hospital with Paramjeet and Dharmendra who were arrested later
 aaropee ko bhi lekar police gumti rahi
 Did the police later realize that they could be arrested
 harsha ne rakabar ke saath gaye asalam se baat kii he
 Aslam was with Rakbar who escaped from the spot
 asalam ne bataaya ki apane ghar ke liye gaay kharid kar le ja rahaa tha
 On seeing him, people also fired
 asalam ne bataaya ki bheed main shaamil kuch log baat kar rahe the ki hamaare saath emele he
 Has the police also killed Rakbar while transporting him to the hospital, is Naval's aunt right, Naval also said that Rakbar was well on the way, found dead when he returned from Gaushala
 to kya rakabar ke saath is ek ghante main aisa kuch hua, jiske bare main andaaza hi lagaaya ja saktaa he
 If he was completely fine, talking, then obviously he could become a witness, a trouble for the crowd
 ab aap hi bataaiye itnaa sawaal he
 The police will investigate or the police will investigate
 rakabar mar gaya
 Aspect Khan also died
 supreme court ne hatyari bheed ko lekar jo dishanirdesh tay kiye hai, ab uskaa imtahaan sabake saamne he
 The Supreme Court had also said that its guideline also applies to earlier events
 kya alvar police vaaki is maamle ko nishpakshta se jaanch kar sakegi, pahalu khan ke maamle main uskaa ricard aapke saamne he
 a new record is that for three hours the police kept rolling with the injured
 kya yah sab anjaane main hua hoga
 Do the police also need to tell whether the injured has to rotate for three hours or taken to the hospital, obviously the police knows this much work, but has the police done this for anyone's benefit
 tippaniyan Rakbar died maarane vaale koun the, ye tab pataa chalegaa jab koi pakadaa jayega or aarope sabit hoga
 Through the crowd, continuous testing is being done whether such hatred has reached within the society, by which people themselves gather and accuse someone, decide the punishment and kill them
 yah koi ikkaa dukka hone vaali ghatnaayen nahin hai
 Had this happened, the Supreme Court would not have to make a list of comprehensive guidelines for the police
 alvar main aisi bheed kaise ban rahi he, kin logon se ban rahi he is ek saal main vahaan police ne dhang se kaam kiya hota to phir ye ghatana nahin hoti
 We are constantly speaking in prime time, rather everyday, communalism turns human into human bomb
 aap apni ankhon se dekh bhi rahe hai
 In the name of religion, such human bombs are being prepared from within the society which can explode anytime and anywhere
 fat rahe hai
 Time is short but you should also consider this news
 bihar ke vidhaan parshad hai naval kishor yadav
 He has said that the governor of Bihar is a maternal grandfather
 maarenge ghunsa ghunsa
 So listen to the legislator who punched Governor Satyapal Malik
 naval kishor yadav bijepi ko sushobhit kar rahe hai
 Rest of you too be blessed to hear them
 kya alvar kii police ne rakabar ko aspataal le jane main deree kii or kya police ne ghayal rakabar ko apni gaadi main rakhane ke baad maaraa, ek mahila ne bataaya he ki police vaale gaadi main rakhe rakabar ko maar rahe the
 At 12
41 am, the police get information that the mob has killed someone
 aapane suna ki thana ghatnasthal se 15-20 minute kii duuri par he phir bhi police ko pahunchane main tees se chalis minute lag jate hai
 Naval Kishore had informed the police, Naval is an activist of Vishwa Hindu Parishad and works for cow protection
 police naval ko lekar hi ghatnasthal par gai
 Now you see, the police picks up Rakbar from the spot at 1
15 pm but it takes three hours to reach the hospital 4 km away
 police chaar baje rakabar ko lekar pahunchati he
 It is very important to know why it took three hours, why the police took three hours
 harsha kumari singh ne exiaar kii kapi or aspataal ke record donon dekhe hai jisamen kaaphi antar he
 It is written in the FIR that Rakbar's body was covered with mud
 aspataal ke record main likhaa he ki rakabar kaa sharir saaf tha
 There were no blood marks on the body
 mitti nahin thi
 Was the police trying to save the mob or any of its leader, when the soil was stained with mud, soaked in blood, why did the police not immediately reach the hospital, why did it bathe on the spot and clean it when it reached the hospital? There were no marks
 uskaa sharir saaf tha
 Would not the evidence be erased by doing so
 harsha kumari singh ne naval kishor se baat kii
 You should read every single thing of Naval carefully
 'sava ek baje ke samathing pahunche
 12
 41 minute kaa samay rahaa hoga
 One reached between 15 and 20
 aapane nikaala, vahiin baahar nikaal kar, mere gaanv ke coli samaaj ke madan laal bhai hai unki boring par yahi dharmendra jinhen aaropee banaaya he, police ne mujrim banaakar bitha rakhaa he, parmijat ko pani kaa backet laakar nahalaaya
 Comforted
 gaay ko bhi transport karnaa chaahate the
 You left
 thane ke pehle chaay pi he
 Mohanji said that he was bringing cows
 thane ke saath andhera he
 He was fit
 pair main dard tha
 He was also talking well, has given the entire statement to the police himself
 baaki kahin dard nahin bataaya
 When the police inquired about it, they gave all the information
 wo donon ladke bhi saath jinke bare main rakabar ne kuch nahin bataaya
 It was 3 o'clock when we came
 ek ghanta lag yaa
 Arrive at the police station at two o'clock
 ek ghante thane main rahe
 At four o'clock we went
 feet tha
 Found dead when he came back
 ' Naval Kishore also released a picture of Rakbar which he took inside the police car today
 ye tasviir naval kishor ke sharir se keechad hataane or use nahalaane ke baad kii he
 Do you see this picture that Rakbar's condition was so bad that he would die in some time? rakabar mar gaya yaa maar diya gaya
 Does not this question arise from this picture
 rakabar ek ahm gavaah ho saktaa tha, khaskar supreme court kii guideline ke baad
 Naval is now an important witness in this case
 jab naval kishor teen baje gaayon ko lekar gaushala jaataa he tab rakabar thik tha, or acchhee tarah se baatcheet kar rahaa tha, jab naval laut kar aata he to rakabar mrit paaya jaataa he
 It should be investigated why the police waited for Naval when he had gone to the cowshed
 vah sidhe rakabar ko lekar aspataal kyon nahin pahunchi
 Naval is surprised that the people whom he spoke to stop at the scene, Dharmendra and Paramjeet have been arrested
 ye donon bhi rakabar ke saath jeep main the
 Rakbar did not identify them nor say anything about these two
 paramjeet ke bhai ne bhi kaha ki agar wo hatya vaali bheed main shaamil hota to police ko soochna kyon detaa
 The mob is killing someone, the police reach the spot, do not chase the crowd, pick up the injured, then perhaps the first thing on their mind is that the injured is needed, then why would the police go with them to the village of Naval Is, because the police was engaged in arranging the car to send the cow to the cowshed
 ab uski praathamikta ghayal kii jagah gaay ho jaati he
 At this place, Naval's aunt saw that the police was killing someone in a jeep
 maaya jo ki naval kii hi chachee hai, inhone dekha ki police rakabar ko laat maar rahi he
 But till then Rakbar is alive, his scream shows
 baad main naval jab police kii gaadi se jaataa he tab bhi rakabar zindaa he or police se khud baat kar rahaa he
 Police leaves from the village of Naval at two o'clock in the night

 If the man is taking the injured, who is in a dying condition, then the police will stop to drink tea

 Aslam told that he was taking away a cow for his house

 So what happened with Rakbar in this one hour, which can only be guessed
 agar wo puri tarah se thik tha, baat kar rahaa tha to zaahir he vah ek gavaah ban saktaa tha, bheed ke liye musiibat ban saktaa tha
 Now you tell me this question
 police jaanch karegi yaa police kii jaanch hogi
 Rakbar died pahalu khan bhi mar gaya
 The Supreme Court has set guidelines for the murderous crowd, now its test is in front of everyone
 supreme court ne yah bhi kaha tha ki uskaa yah dishanirdesh pehle kii ghatnaon par bhi lagu hota he
 Will the Alwar police really be able to investigate the matter impartially, his record in the aspect of the matter is before you
 ek nayaa ricard yah he ki teen ghante tak police ghayal ko lekar ghumaati rahi
 Would it have happened inadvertently? kya police ko yah bataane kii zarurat bhi he ki ghayal ko teen ghanta ghumana he yaa aspataal le janaa he, zaahir he police ko itnaa kaam to pataa he, magar kya police ne yah kaam kisi ke phaayde ke liye kiya he
 The comments rakabar mar gaya
 Who was the killer, it will be known when someone is caught and the charge is proved

 It is written in the FIR that Rakbar's body was covered with mud
 aspataal ke record main likhaa he ki rakabar kaa sharir saaf tha
 There were no blood marks on the body
 mitti nahin thi
 Was the police trying to save the mob or any of its leader, when the soil was stained with mud, soaked in blood, why did the police not immediately reach the hospital, why did it bathe on the spot and clean it when it reached the hospital? There were no marks
 uskaa sharir saaf tha
 Would not the evidence be erased by doing so

 Elsewhere, no pain was told

 Rakbar was fine when Naval Kishore goes to the cowshed with cows at three o'clock, and was having a good conversation, Rakbar is found dead when Naval returns
 is baat kii jaanch honi chahie ki jab naval gaay lekar gaushala chalaa gaya tha tab police ne uskaa intazaar kyon kiya
 Why did she not reach hospital directly with Rakbar
 naval is baat se hairaan he ki jin logon ko usne ghatnasthal par rukne ke liye bolaa, dharmendra or paramjeet unhen arest kar liya he
 Both of them were also in the jeep with Rakbar

 bihar ke vidhaan parshad hai naval kishor yadav
 He has said that the governor of Bihar is a maternal grandfather
 maarenge ghunsa ghunsa
 So listen to the legislator who punched Governor Satyapal Malik
 naval kishor yadav bijepi ko sushobhit kar rahe hai
 Rest of you too be blessed to hear them
 bheed kisi ko maar rahi he, police maukey par pahunch jaati he, bheed kaa peechha nahin karti he, ghayal ko uthaati he, tab shaayad uske man main pehali baat hogi ki ghayal kii jaan zaruri he, tab police use lekar naval ke gaanv kyon jaati he, kyonki police gaay ko gaushala bhejne ke liye gaadi ke intazaam main lagi thi
 Now his priority becomes cow instead of injured
 isi jagah par naval kii chachee ne dekha ki police jeep main kisi ko maar rahi he
 Maya, who is Naval's aunt, saw the police kicking Rakbar
 magar tab tak rakabar zindaa he uski cheekh se pataa chalata he
 Later, when Naval leaves the police car, Rakbar is still alive and talking to the police himself
 naval ke gaanv se police nikalati he do baje raat ko
 On the way, we stop for tea
 govindgarh mode par chaay vaale se chaar cap chaay banane ke liye kahati he
 Rakbar complains of pain here
 police aspataal lekar nahin jaati he, use thana lekar jaati he
 It is here that at 3 o'clock, a Naval carriage is carried to the cowshed
 15 kimi dur
 When he returns in an hour, he sees that Rakbar is dead
 jo aadmi ghayal ho, jo marane kii sthiti main ho, use police lekar ja rahi ho to kya police chaay pine ke liye rukegi
 'police goes to police station from Govindgarh, Rakbar is still moaning
 aspataal ek kimi kii duuri par he thane se
 But it is 4 o'clock on reaching and Rakbar dies
 jab pahunchataa he tab vah mara hua tha
 The police went to the hospital with Paramjeet and Dharmendra who were arrested later
 aaropee ko bhi lekar police gumti rahi
 Did the police later realize that they could be arrested
 harsha ne rakabar ke saath gaye asalam se baat kii he
 Aslam was with Rakbar who escaped from the spot
 asalam ne bataaya ki apane ghar ke liye gaay kharid kar le ja rahaa tha
 On seeing him, people also fired
 asalam ne bataaya ki bheed main shaamil kuch log baat kar rahe the ki hamaare saath emele he
 Has the police also killed Rakbar while transporting him to the hospital, is Naval's aunt right, Naval also said that Rakbar was well on the way, found dead when he returned from Gaushala
 to kya rakabar ke saath is ek ghante main aisa kuch hua, jiske bare main andaaza hi lagaaya ja saktaa he
 If he was completely fine, talking, then obviously he could become a witness, a trouble for the crowd
 ab aap hi bataaiye itnaa sawaal he
 The police will investigate or the police will investigate
 rakabar mar gaya
 Aspect Khan also died
 supreme court ne hatyari bheed ko lekar jo dishanirdesh tay kiye hai, ab uskaa imtahaan sabake saamne he
 The Supreme Court had also said that its guideline also applies to earlier events
 kya alvar police vaaki is maamle ko nishpakshta se jaanch kar sakegi, pahalu khan ke maamle main uskaa ricard aapke saamne he
 a new record is that for three hours the police kept rolling with the injured
 kya yah sab anjaane main hua hoga
 Do the police also need to tell whether the injured has to rotate for three hours or taken to the hospital, obviously the police knows this much work, but has the police done this for anyone's benefit
 tippaniyan Rakbar died maarane vaale koun the, ye tab pataa chalegaa jab koi pakadaa jayega or aarope sabit hoga
 Through the crowd, continuous testing is being done whether such hatred has reached within the society, by which people themselves gather and accuse someone, decide the punishment and kill them

 'police govindgarh se thana jaati he, rakabar karaah rahaa he phir bhi
 The hospital is at a distance of one km from the police station
 lekin pahunchate pahunchate 4 baj jate hai or rakabar mar jaataa he
 He was dead when he arrived
 paramjeet or dharmendra ko lekar hi police aspataal gai thi jinhen baad main giraftaar kiya gaya
 The police roamed around the accused as well
 kya police ko baad main khyaal aayaa ki inhen giraftaar kiya ja saktaa he
 Harsha talks to Aslam with Rakbar
 asalam rakabar ke saath tha jo maukey se bhaag niklaa
 Aslam told that he was taking away a cow for his house
 use dekhakar logon ne firing bhi kii
 Aslam told that some people in the crowd were talking that we have MLA with us
 kya police ne bhi rakabar ko ghatnasthal se aspataal le jate vakt maaraa he, kya naval kii chachee kii baat sahi he, naval ne bhi kaha ki rakabar raste main bilkul thik tha, jab gaushala se lautaa to mara hua paaya
 So what happened with Rakbar in this one hour, which can only be guessed
 agar wo puri tarah se thik tha, baat kar rahaa tha to zaahir he vah ek gavaah ban saktaa tha, bheed ke liye musiibat ban saktaa tha
 Now you tell me this question

 gold medal jeetne ke baad rafel silva kii ankhon main aansu the, sirf rafel kyon vahaan par maujuud brazil ke har darshak kii ankhon main aansu the
 This was not a small victory, but this victory shortened many people who were commenting on Rafael
 unke rang or samudaay ko lekar mazaaq uda rahe the
 This victory is not just a gold medal, but it is a victory for the disadvantaged community of Brazil, which has been struggling for many years
 rafel silva se brazil ke liye rio olympic main judo main gold medal jeeta
 In the 57 kg women's competition, Silva won the gold medal by defeating Sumiya Dorjasuren of Mongolia
 rafel silva kaa zindagi kaaphi sangharsh main gujri he
 Silva was born in Favela, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, considered to be Rio's biggest slum
 fawel ilaaka aparaadh gatividhiyon ke liye janaa jaataa he
 The biggest drug mafia in Brazil live in this area
 rafel ke parivaar ne rafel ko drug se dur rakhane ke liye judo training centre main daalila karavaaya tha
 Rafael had no interest in Judo since childhood, rather he played football, fought with boys and was even expelled from school several times
 judo training ke dauraan rafel kai baar biimaar ho jaati thim kyonki garibi kii vajah se unhen upyukt diet nahin mil paa rahi thi
 Rafael never lived with the hope that she could become a good judo player
 2008 main rafel kii zindagi badal gai jab 19 saal ke umr main thailand main hui junior judo championships main rafel ne silver medal jeeta
 This silver medal changed Rafael's thinking, now he felt that she could become a good judo player, win the medal, do something for herself and the community
 tippaniyan The 2012 Olympics in London were the most frightening moments for Rafael
 landan olympic main avaidh pakad ke vajah se rafel ko ayogy ghoshit kiya gaya, phir kya hua soshal media main rafel kaa kaaphi mazaaq udaaya gaya
 Commented on its color and community
 unki khilaaf apshabd bole gaye
 He was also called a monkey
 yah sab dekhne ke baad rafel judo chhod dena chaahati thim
 Rafael also left training for a few days, but after convincing the coaches and family members, Rafael resumed his training
 pichley chaar saalon se rafel roj is tarah ke caments ko yaad kar karti thim
 Taking training with these memories
 bas unhen ek maukey kii jarurat thi
 She wanted to erase the spots on her at the London Olympics
 kal vah mauka aayaa jab mahaj kuch minutes ke andar rafel ne apane upar lage dhabbe ko mitaa diya
 He won the first gold medal for Brazil at the Rio Olympics
 is jeet ke saath rafel kii ankhon main aansu the
 Only his name was heard everywhere

 Rafael Silva's life has gone through a lot of struggle
 silva kaa janm brazil ke rio di janero ke favela main hua tha, jo rio kaa sabase bada slam mana jaataa he
 Fawale area is known for crime activities
 brazil ke bade se bade drug mafia is ilaake main rahete hai
 Rafael's family had admitted Rafael to Judo Training Center to keep him away from drugs
 bachapan se judo ke prati rafel kii koi dilchaspee nahin thi balki vah footbal khelti thim, ladakon se ladaai karti thim or kai baar skool se nikaali bhi ja chuki thim
 During judo training, Rafael used to get sick many times because he could not get proper diet due to poverty
 rafel kabhi is ummid ke saath nahin ji rahi thim ki vah ek acchhee judo khilaadi ban sakati hai
 Rafael's life changed in 2008 when at the age of 19, Rafael won the silver medal at the Junior Judo Championship in Thailand
 is silver medal ne rafel ke soch ko badal diya, ab unhen lagane laga ki vah ek acchhee judo khilaadi ban sakati hai, medal jeet sakati hai, apane or samudaay ke liye kuch kar sakati hai
 The comments 2012 main landan main hue olympic rafel ke liye sabase bhayaavah kshan the
 Rafael was disqualified due to illegal holdings in London Olympics, then what happened was Rafael was quite mocked on social media
 uske rang or samudaay ko lekar coment kiya gaya
 Abusive words were spoken against him
 unako bandar bhi bolaa gaya
 After seeing all this, Rafael wanted to leave Judo
 kuch din ke liye rafel ne tranning bhi chhod di, lekin coach or parivaar ke logon ke samajhane ke baad rafel ne dobaaraa apni training shuru kii
 For the last four years, Rafael Rose used to remember such comments
 in yaadon ke saath training le rahi thim
 All they needed was a chance
 landan olympic main un par lage dhabbe ko vah mitaanaa chaahati thim
 The occasion came yesterday when within a few minutes Rafael erased the spots on him
 unhone rio olympic main brazil ke liye pehla gold medal jeeta
 Rafael had tears in his eyes with this victory
 chaaron taraf sirf unka naam sunai de rahaa tha
