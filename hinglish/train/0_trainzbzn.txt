 The government's air quality monitoring center 'safar' said that pollution levels in delhi-ncr have entered the 'severe' or 'very severe' category on Wednesday

 ' loksabhaa chunaav ke chathe charan main yani 12 may ko bihar kii siwan loksabhaa seat par voting hone vaali he
 This Lok Sabha seat is being discussed all over the country
 darasal, yahaan chunavi maidan main do bahubali netaaon kii patniyaan hai
 But before voting, there has been a different debate in Siwan's politics
 yah bahes ''bhagava banaam burke'' kii he
 Why is there, as a matter of fact, Heena Shahab, the RJD candidate from Siwan Lok Sabha seat and wife of former MP Mohammad Shahabuddin, is in the election field and her dress is burqa
 vahiin jediu kii mahila pratyaashee kavita singh ke pati or jile main hindu yuva vahini ke mukhiya ajay singh kaa pahanava bhagava he
 This is the reason why "saffron versus burqa" is being debated
 is bahes kii shuruyaat ajay singh ne hina shahaab ke burke par tippanee se kii he 
 Ajay Singh is referring to Heena Shahab's burqa in campaigning
 He is referring to Heena Shahab's dress in almost every election campaign
 iske alaava ajay singh chunaav prachaar ke dauraan purv saansad mohammad shahabuddin kii aapraadhik chhavi or pakistan kii bhi baat karte hai
 Interestingly, Ajay Singh himself has several cases registered and is out on bail
 haalanki ajay singh kii patni or jediu pratyaashee kavita singh piem narendra modi or nitish kumaar ke vikaas kaaryon par vot maangati najar aa rahi hai
 In contrast, Heena wants to stay on the issue of Shahab Siwan's development
 hina shahaab khud ko siwan kii beti bataate hue logon se vot maang rahi hai
 Problems of JDU candidate Kavita Singh While JDU candidate Kavita Singh is seeking votes by talking about the development of Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and PM Narendra Modi, their difficulties are not less
 siwan kii raajnneeti par najar rakhane vaale patrkaar sudhir kumaar tiwari bataate hai ki endie ke bheetar jabardast foot dekhne ko mil rahi he
 a charge-sheet is going on between bjp's current MP Om Prakash Yadav and District President Manoj Singh
 yah foot itani zyada he ki hi donon netaa jediu pratyaashee kavita singh ke namakan ke dauraan manch par bhid gaye the
 
 iske alaava siwan seat jediu ke khate main jane or saansad omprakash yadav kaa tikat katane kii vajah se bhi unke samarthakon main naaraazgi dekhne ko mil rahi he
 According to Sudhir Tiwari, supporters of Omprakash Yadav are openly opposing Kavita Singh
 iske alaava ajay singh ke kai aapattijanak bayaan kavita singh kii mushkilen badha rahi hai
 RJD candidate Heena Shahab has been facing the last battle for Heena Shahab, who has been losing the Lok Sabha elections twice
 haar ke baavjood hina shahaab par rajd ne bharosa jataayaa he lekin unke liye har baar kii tarah ek baar phir pati mohammad shahabuddin kii aapraadhik chhavi baadhak ban rahi he
 This is the reason that during the election campaign his opponents are referring to the tenure of Shahabuddin
 yah hina shahaab ke liye asahaj karne jaisaa he
 However, local journalist Sudhir says that Heena Shahab is presenting former MP Mohammad Shahabuddin as a development man
 baharhaal, 23 may ko chunavi nateezon ke saath yah tay ho jayega ki siwan kii janata kaa kya mood he

 Earlier, the Congress party has once welcomed the decision of the government to file a review petition on the order of the Supreme Court on SAC-ST law and demanded that there should be an inquiry that in the end, the government's plea in the court Why was not done properly and the case government lost
 tippaniyan Congress spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi reacted to the Bharat Bandh called by several organizations today following the Supreme Court order
 eenai se baatcheet main singhvi ne yah baat kahi
 Let me tell you that today many Dalit organizations have called for a Bharat Bandh in protest against the Supreme Court's decision on SC-ST Act
 band ko kai raajnneetik partiyon or kai sanghathanon ne samarthan bhi diya he
 Organizations demand that the Act be withdrawn by amending the Scheduled Castes and Tribes Atrocities Prevention Act 1989 and implemented as before
 dalit sanghathanon ke virodh kaa sabase adhik asar punjab main padane kii sambhaavna he, jisaki vajah se rajya ke sabhi shikshan santhaan, saarvajanik parivahan ko aaj band rakhaa gaya he
 Due to this, the CBSE board papers to be held today in the state have been canceled

 Those who challenge this thinking suppress them with violence

 The comments congress pravaktaa abhishek manu singhvi ne supreme court ke aadesh ke baad aaj kai sanghathanon dwaara bulaae gaye bharat band par yah pratikriya di
 Singhvi said this in a conversation with ANI
 bataa den ki SC-ST act par supreme court ke faisle ke virodh main aaj kai dalit sanghathanon ne bharat band kaa aahvaan kiya he
 The bandh has also been supported by many political parties and many organizations
 sanghathanon kii maang he ki anusuchit jati-janajati atyaachaar nivaaran adhinium 1989 main sanshodhan ko waapas lekar act ko pehle kii tarah lagu kiya jaae
 Protest by Dalit organizations is most likely to fall in Punjab, due to which all the educational institutions, public transport in the state have been closed today
 is vajah se rajya main aaj hone vaale sibiesai ke board ke paper radd kar die hai

 Chief Minister Jayalalithaa in her second letter to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh after the final decision was notified by the Center on February 20, said that it was the habit of the Karnataka government to use the water flow in the summer instead of towards the reservoirs
 It almost empties its four reservoirs Krishnarajasagar, Kabini, Hemvati and Harangi

 Vishwas and Kejriwal have got different views on many issues
 chaahe wo maamla kapil mishra kaa ho yaa amanatullah khan kaa

 Kapil had the support of Kumar Vishwas and the struggle gradually increased
 baad main kapil mishra bijepi kii ore khiskate gaye or vivaad mand padataa gaya
 But the silence in the whole case proved Kejriwal to be a silent killer for Kapil Mishra

 It will be very difficult for the Bharatiya Janata Party to repeat the 2014 performance in Uttar Pradesh
 kai jaankaar maanate hai ki sapa-basapa ke mahagathbandhan main shaamil na hokar congress bijepi kii hi madad kar rahi he or use khud kaa koi phayda nahin hone ja rahaa he, lekin aankade kuch or bataate hai
 Once the staunch enemies of each other, the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and Samajwadi Party (SP) joined hands, it was decided that on the same day the good days of the Bharatiya Janata Party in the state holding the reins of power
 Difficulties have arisen in bijepi ke liye 2014 kaa pradarshan doharaana aasaan na hoga
 But many election experts believe that the Congress is only helping the BJP by not joining the grand alliance and it does not seem to have any special benefit
 lekin kya sachai yahi he
 After all, whose vote will the Congress cut
 india today data intelligence unit (diu) ne ye jaanane kii koshish kii
 We analyzed the caste profile of the candidates of these three parties in Uttar Pradesh
 india today data intelligence unit ne 80 main se 52 chunaav kshetron se mili aankadon kaa vishleshan kiya to nattejey chaunkaane vaale nikle
 According to this analysis, the Congress seems to be helping the SP-BSP alliance on 36 seats
 vahi bache hue 16 siton par bijepi virdohi vot bant sakate hai jinka phayda bijepi ko mil saktaa he
 The results of our analysis show that despite not participating in the Grand Alliance, the Congress has created candidates who will cut the bjp's vote and can help the coalition candidates
 ham aapako bataa den ki 2014 main bijepi ne upi kii 80 loksabhaa siton main se 71 par jeet darj kii thi
 diu has been analyzed on the basis of caste as caste can play a big role in these elections as always
 jati ke aadhaar par vishleshanjati kaa ganitupi main jati kaa apana ganit he, har party ke apane vafaadaar voter hai
 For example, the Jatavs are believed to support the BSP, the Yadav and the Muslim Samajwadi Party and the upper caste, non-jatav Dalit and non-yadav OBC BJP
 agar paramparaagat vot kaa aadhaar chalaa or sabhi jatiyon ne partiyon main apni nishtha jataai to congress, espi-bispi gathbandhan ko nuksaan nahin pahunchaa rahi he
 Mutual agreement in Congress-alliance on 8 seats The selection of candidates suggests that there is a mutual agreement between Congress and the alliance on 8 seats
 donon dhadon ne tay kiya he ki apane bade netaaon ke khilaaf wo koi ummidavaar nahin utaarenge
 The Congress has not fielded any candidates on 6 such seats - Muzaffarnagar and Baghpat from where Ajit Singh and his son Jayant Chaudhary are contesting
 usee tarah mulaayam kunbe ke khilaaf bhi congress ne pratyaashee nahin utaare hai jahaan mainpuri ( mulaayam singh), firozabad (mulaayam ke bhattije akshay yadav), azamgarh or kannauj jahaan se akhilesh or unki patni dimple pratyaashee hai
 The same alliance did not field its candidates from Rae Bareli and Amethi, where Sonia and Rahul are Congress candidates
 congress or gathbandhan main 28 (yaa 27 siton) par ankaha samjhautrab tak ke vishleshan main hamane 52 main se 8 siton par paaya ki congress or gathbandhan main sidhe sidhe samjhauta he ab baaki 44 siton par najar daalate hai
 In 34 of the 44 seats, Congress has given tickets to candidates whose castes are usually BJP supporters
 agar is kaa jativaar akalan karen to congress ne 17 ummidavaar aise khadey kiye hai jo brahman, rajput, vaisya, jat yaa duusari savarna jati se hai
 According to the lokniti-csds survey, in 2014, these castes supported more than 70 percent of the BJP
 jamini report bhi bataati he ki in 17 siton main se 14 siton par congress, bijepi ko nuksaan pahunchaa sakati he
 In 11 other seats, Congress has fielded non-yadav OBC candidates, including Koiri, Kurmi, Lodh Shakya and Sonar
 lokaneeti-siesds ke survey ke mutabik 2014 main 53 fisadi koiri / kurmi or duusari obisi jatiyon main se 61 fisadi matadaaton ne bijepi ko vot diya tha
 According to analysis of diu, Congress has fielded 9 such candidates who can cut bjp's vote
 congress ke gaiyr jatav dalit ummidavaar bhi 6 main 4 siton par bijepi ke vot kaat sakate hai
 According to the survey, in 2014, 45 percent of the voters of these castes directly voted for the BJP
 kul milakar congress ke ummidavaar in 52 siton main se 28 siton par bijepi ko nuksaan pahunchaa sakate hai
 These figures suggest that there are more challenges and challenges for the BJP
 sapa-basapa kaa muslim-yadav-dalit gathjod kaagaj par bahut majboot dikhataa he or ek saath ye upi main ek bahut badi takat ban jate hai
 Together they make up about half of up's population
 poling agency si-voter ke mutabik muslim-yadav-dalit gathjod kii taadaad 80 main 47 siton par 50 fisadi se zyada he
 Seeing the same figures, the Congress seems to have fielded non-muslim-yadav-dalit candidates who can harm the BJP
 congress kahaan kar rahi bijepi kii madadaankadon ke vishleshan se ye bhi pataa chalaa ki congress ne 7 musalamaanon ko bhi tikat diya he
 However, surveys show that in 2014, Muslims have mostly voted for SP-BSP, of which 58 per cent for SP and 18 per cent for BSP
 musalmaan voton main bikharaav kaa phayda bijepi ko mil saktaa he
 In three Lok Sabha constituencies, the Congress gave tickets to the Jatavs, whose 68 percent of the caste vote went to the BSP
 inamen se do gathbandhan ko to ek bijepi ko nuksaan pahunchaa sakate hai
 Overall, it can be said through this analysis that the Congress is going to harm the BJP more than the SP-BSP by fighting it alone

 Whether or not the instant messaging app whatsapp can be regulated will be known in the coming times
 lekin telecom regaulator athurity of india (TRAI) ne watsap jaisi over da top sarvice ko regaullett karne ko lekar ek paper jari kiya he
 TRAI has released a paper on Monday asking the industry for an opinion on whether services like whatsapp, Skype and Viber should be regulated
 chunki sidhe taur par inhen regaullett karnaa net neutrality ke khilaaf ho saktaa he
 Therefore it can be regulated by citing economic and security
 traixvara taiyaar kiye gaye is paper kaa tital ‘regulatory framework for over the top communication service’ he
 It has actually been brought up for discussion as to whether these services should be regulated
 isamen yah bhi kaha gaya he ki kya telecom companiyon kii tarah in kmaunication eps ko neshnal security hit main regaullett karne kii jarurat he
 Because sometimes such apps are used to spread dangerous rumors and it is difficult to find out where these rumors are being spread and it is difficult even for the security agency
 TRAI ne is paper main yah bhi poocha he ki kyatelicomcompaniyon ke liye data security, privesi kanoon in communication eps se alag hone chahie
 Significantly, the telecom companies have been demanding that communication apps like whatsapp should also be regulated, as they provide similar services without licenses and conditions
 isalke liye unhen license fee bhi nahin deni hoti he jisase unhen phayda hota he
 Those supporting net neutrality have been opposed to regulating OTT service
 unka maananaa he ki regaullett karne se yugers kii privesi main samasya hogi
 TRAI has stated, 'the purpose of this consultation paper is to analyze and consult on the growth of OTT and the problems arising from it
 isamen OTT or telecom sarvice prowiders ke sambandh bhi shaamil hai
 TRAI has asked the industry to give its opinion on this issue and deadline is till December 10
 sarkaar ne samalangikta ko ucchtam nyaayalay dwaara gaiyrkanoonee ghoshit kiye jane ke faisle ko palatney ke liye fori kadam uthaane kaa vaada kiya or sanket diya ki vah sheersh adaalat main upachaaratmak yachika daakhil kar sakati he
 Law Minister Kapil Sibal told reporters amid controversy over the decision, "we have to change the law
" yadi ucchtam nyaayalay ne is kanoon ko sahi tehraaya he, to nishchit rup se hamen majboot kadam uthaane honge
 Change has to be made fast and no delay can be made
 ham jald se jald badlaav karne ke liye sabhi uplabdh upayon kaa istemaal karenge
 Asked whether the government will bring a bill to amend section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, he said that this time is important
 hamen vayaskon ke sahmatipurna sambandhon ko aparaadh kii shrenee se nikaalnaa hoga
 When asked about the measures available with the government, Sibal said, one option is to bring it to Parliament as soon as possible
 ek anya vikalp he ki koi anya rasta nikaalane ke liye ucchtam nyaayalay se sampark kiya jaae
 We will take the path that will give us the quick results
 vittamantri pi chidambaram ne kaha ki ucchtam nyaayalay kaa faisla 'galat' he or sheersh adaalat ke faisle ko sahi karne ke liye sabhi vikalpon ko dekha jayega
 Describing the judgment as disappointing, he said that the court should have taken care of the prevailing social and moral values in the case
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar ko is maamle main samiksha yaa upachaaratmak yachika daakhil kerani chahie or maamle kii sunwaayee paanch-sadasyeey peeth dwaara kii jaani chahie
 Chidambaram said that the decision of the Delhi High Court was very thoughtful and based on research, which the Central Government accepted and did not challenge it in the Supreme Court
 unhone saath hi kaha ki ucch nyaayalay ke faisle ko ucchtam nyaayalay main chunauti nahin dene kaa sarkaar kaa faisla unki party kaa bhi vichaar he
 Chidambaram said that the bench which gave the verdict should have referred the case to a five-member bench and that there should be no inertia in the interpretation of the law
 chidambaram ne kaha, aapane kiya kya ki aap 1860 ke samay main chale gaye or isliye main isse behad pareshaan hum
 He said that the current Section 377 was created in 1860 and it reflects the society and moral values of the time and in that era there was very little knowledge of psychology, anthropology, genetics etc
 chidambaram ne kaha, lekin aaj varsh 2013 main maanviya manovigyaan, maanviya manochikitsa or maanviya genetics ke bare main itani adhik jaankaree he ki yah aaj ke saamaajik or naitik mulya hai
 This decision is completely bogus
 yah puche jane par ki sarkaar ne 16 disambar kii samuhik balaatkaar kii ghatana ke baad balaatkaar kanoonon main sanshodhan karte samay dhara 377 main sanshodhan kyon nahin kiya, chidambaram ne kaha ki ucch nyaayalay kaa dhara 377 ke sambandh main faisla keval ek simit myne main tha
 The Finance Minister said, he had only outlawed homosexuality as a crime in adults and in privacy, and therefore there was no need to amend section 377
 gujarat ke palanpur shahar main rashan card se judi badi laaparvaahee saamne ai he
 Here a family used to get cheaper ration from the government ration shop in the name of a dog for 8 years
 is baat kii khabar kii tehseeldaar karyaalay ko lagi to hadakamp much gaya
 All the top officers and employees engaged in daub
 aanan-fanan main karmchaariyon ne sthiti ko bhaanpate hue turant apni galati sudhaar lee
 Actually, the family of Mughaliben Parmar lives in Jetwas village in Palanpur
 unke ghar main ai nai bahu kaa naam rashan card main darj karaane ke liye parivaar ke sadsy tehseeldaar karyaalay ke din-raat chakkar laga rahe the, lekin unka naam rashan card main darj nahin kiya ja rahaa tha
 Fed up with the functioning of government officials, the daughter-in-law finally reached the Tehsildar office
 yahaan usne pehle karmchaariyon se uskaa namrashan cardamein likhane kaha
 But he kept avoiding it
 isse naaraaz hokar usne kaha ki rashan card main yadi kaalu kute kaa naam likh sakate ho to meraa kyon nahin likh rahe ho
 On hearing this, the Tehsildar office was stirred up
 jab karmchaariyon ne dekha to vaaki main rashan card par kaalu naam likhaa tha, jo unka paaltukuttatha
 The dog's name was renamed after the mistake was revealed
 jab is baat kii khabar media main ai to sarkari afasaron kii lipa-potee shuru ho gai
 In order to hide the mistake, the officers argued that when the government employee reached Mughaliben Parmar's house at the time of the census, he had written the name of the family member Kalu
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki parivaar ke log kaalu ke naam par aath saal tak sarkari dukaan se sasta rashan kharidte rahe
 Now the dog has also died
 haalanki, ab shikaayat milane par tehseeldaar karyaalay se parivaar kaa nayaa rashan card banaaya gaya he
 Expressing satisfaction over the 18-man squad selected for next month's Olympic qualifier, Indian hockey team head coach Michael Knobs set aside the controversy over the exclusion of some senior players and said that form and performance were the basis of selection
 major dhyanchand stadium par 18 se 26 farvari tak hone vaale kwalifire ke liye chuni gai bhartiya team main purv captain raajapaal singh or anbhavi midfilder arjuna halppa ko jagah nahin mil saki he
 When asked about this, Nobbs said, 'I am happy with the team
 khilaadiyon ke form or pradarshan ke aadhaar par hi team chuni gai he
 My job was to pick the best team without any bias and the selectors have unanimously selected the team
 ’unhone kaha, ‘chayankarta kaaphi anbhavi or purv olympian hai
 They do their job well and the team is not selected based on the credibility of the players but on the form
 ’australian coach ne kaha ki bharat ko hockey main phir sheersh par laane ke liye kade faisle lene jaruri he
 He said, 'change is difficult and this change is also necessary
 ’vahiin captain bharat chhetri ne raajapaal ko baahar rakhane or halppa ko standby main rakhane ke faisle kaa bachaav karte hue kaha, ‘ jo team chuni gai he, vah kharaab nahin he
 Now, like cricket, all-rounders are needed in hockey too
 ’upakptain sardaar singh ne kaha ki unhen yakeen he ki yah team olympic ke liye kwalifai kar legi
 He said, 'arjun and Rajpal are senior players but fitness problems can happen to anyone
 yah team bhi behtareen he or olympic ke liye kwalifai karegi
 When asked which team considered the biggest challenge for the qualifier, Nobbs said that no team can be taken lightly in international hockey
 unhone kaha, ‘hamane ek samooh banaaya he jo duusari tiimon ke pradarshan kaa vishleshan kar rahaa he
 No team can be taken lightly in international hockey, nor do i believe that we have got the easiest pool
 ’unhone kaha ki bhartiya team dephence samet khel ke har pahalu main khud ko taraashne main juty he
 "our goal is not just to qualify but also to perform well in the Olympics," said Nobbs
 hamane apni kamajoriyon or takaton ko pahachaanaa he or us par mehnat kar rahe hai
 Special efforts are being made on defense
 ’chotil midfilder gurbaj singh ke bare main coach ne kaha ki uski fitness kaa phir se akalan kiya jaayegaa or feet hone par vah agle shivi main nishchit taur par hoga
 He said, 'he is not fully fit
 uski fitness kaa phir se akalan hoga
 i don't know that he started practicing
 vah jis din shat pratishat feet hoga, shivi main shaamil hoga

 america raashtrapati chunaavon main apane pratidwandi mit romany ke khilaaf obama ke ek vigyaapan se jabardast hangaamaa machaa hua he
 The ability of Indians has been made a joke on the pretext of advertising
 apane bharat virdohi ravaiye ke liye badnaam rahe america raashtrapati baraak obama ne bharat ke khilaaf ek nayaa daanv khel diya he or is baar ye daanv aayaa he ek vigyaapan kii shakl main
 After which there has been a huge uproar from all over India to America
 bharat ko nishaanaa banaate hue obama ne ek vigyaapan jari kiya he
 However, the ad is part of Obama's presidential campaign
 lekin is vigyaapan ke bahaane bharatiyon kii kaabiliyat kaa mazaaq banaaya gaya he
 Obama has issued this advertisement against his rival Mitt Romney in the US presidential elections
 raashtrapati baraak obama ne republican pratyaashee mit romany par nishaanaa sadhate hue unki bharat samarthak niti kii aalochana kii he
 The advertisement alleged that while governor of the state of Massachusetts, Romney outsourced jobs to India
 romany ke khilaaf banaae gaye is vigyaapan ko varjeenia, ohio or iova praant main prasaarit prachaarit kiya jayega
 President Obama has also stamped this advertisement
 internet par ye video bhi jari ho chukaa he or aane vaale chunaav prachaar main is vigyaapan ko jor-shor se dikhaane kii taiyaari kii ja rahi he
 According to a report, Obama is spending about seven lakh 80 thousand dollars i
e
 about four crore rupees on this advertisement
 bhartiya samudaay main isi vigyaapan ke jari hone ke baad hangaamaa much gaya he
 Obama is once again in the fray for the presidential election in November and he has a direct contest with Republican candidate Mitt Romney
 vigyaapan ke jariye bhale hi mit romany par nishaanaa saadhaa gaya ho, lekin isaki makasad saaf he or wo he america voters ke man main bharatiyon kaa dar paidaa karne kii koshish
 What is in this advertisement? This advertisement starts with the praise of Obama
 shuruyaat main hi bataaya jaataa he ki kis tarah obama kii green energy kii nitiyon ne hajaaron america naujavaanon ko naukariyon kii saugat di
 Soon after this, the process of targeting India on the pretext of Republican candidate Mitt Romney starts
 vigyaapan kii agali line main sawaal poocha jaataa he
 What about Mitt Romney? (how about Romney) The ad tells how he, while a corporate CEO, sent American jobs to countries like Mexico and China and then directly targeted India in Obama's dirty ad bomb
 
 is vigyaapan ke jariye bharatiyon kaa dar america logon ke dil main paidaa karne kii koshish kii gai he
 The next line says how as governor he sent state services jobs to call centers in India and he is still talking about tax relief to companies that will outsource jobs
 mit romany ke bare main aid kahata he ki unhone apane swiss bank account kaa khulaasa karne se inkaar kar diya he
 That is, Romney has been directly accused of giving jobs in India and entering into secret agreements with outsourcing companies
 vigyaapan kii inhen linon ne puure bhartiya samudaay main khalabali machaa di he
 Obama, who has fallen in popularity, is finding it difficult to save his crown in the face of Ed's pro-unemployment storm
 iske alaava paanch saalon ke apane kaarykaal main osama ke khatme ke alaava obama ke paas koi badi uplabdhi nahin he jiske sahare wo apane chunaav prachaar ko dhar de saken
 Indeed, unemployment has become the biggest issue facing Barack Obama for the upcoming presidential elections
 berogari dur karne ke mudde par hi obama ne pichhlaa chunaav ladaa tha
 But in the last five years, unemployment has increased instead of ending
 kuch maheenon pehle ke aankadon ke mutabik america main berogari dar 09 fisadi thi
 In the history of America so far, no President has been able to stand so much ahead of such a high unemployment rate
 yahi vajah he ki berogari kii aandhi ke saamne obama ko apana taj bachaana mushkil lag rahaa he
 Apart from this, in his tenure of five years, Obama has no major achievement other than the elimination of Osama, with the help of which he can give edge to his election campaign
 aise halaat main obama ko dar he ki berogari kii aandhi kahin unka taj na le ude
 Because their popularity is also steadily declining
 raashtrapati chunaavon ko lekar haal hi main karaaye gayi survey main obama ko 47 fisadi logon kaa samarthan praapt hua tha jabaki romany ko 43 fisadi kaa
 That is, the distance of popularity is becoming less frequent
 iske alaava survey main 53 fisadi matadaataaon ne kaha ki unke liye berajgari or aarthik badahaali behad mahatvapurn mudde hai or yahi is baar ke chunaav kii disha tay karenge
 45 percent of voters believe Romney could outperform Obama on the issue of jobs and the economy
 inhen surveykshanon ke chalate aajkal obama america kii berogari kaa thikra bharat jaise deshon par phod rahe hai
 Obama's anti-india rant is not new
 US President Barack Obama has already been infamous for his anti-india attitude
 isse pehle bhi wo kai baar bharat virdohi bayaan dekar vivaadon main bane rahe hai
 Fear of India and opposition to India has been a chronic nature of Obama
 ye pehali baar nahin he jab obama ne bharat par nishaanaa saadhaa ho
 Obama started speaking out against India in 2008 when he was fighting for the presidential election in America
 obama ne apane chunaav main outsorcing ko sabase bada mudda banaaya
 Obama repeatedly asked for votes to win the jobs that Americans are entitled to by outsourcing to Indians
 ye wo daur tha jab mandi ke kadam america par pad chuke the, lihaaza obama ko vot mili or wo raashtrapati ban gaye
 But even after becoming President, Obama's thinking did not change
 2009 main jab america puri tarah mandi ke shikanje main aa gaya or vahaan ke karporate world ne obama kii sarkaar se aarthik sahaayta kii guhaar kii or tab obama ne rakhi ek shart
 Accordingly, the same company will be given financial assistance from the government which neither outsourcing nor will do so in future
 iske baad bhi obama baar baar america companiyon se apil karte rahe ki wo bharat se outsorcing naa karen
 Because it increases unemployment inside the US
 lekin obama ko ye baat kabhi samaj main nahin ai ki outsorcing ke zarie bhartiya noujvaan jitani tankhwaah main kaam karte hai usee kaam ke liye america noujvaan 10 guna zyada tankhwaah maangate hai
 It is obvious that in such a situation, the American company will not outsource, it will stop before time and the financial condition of America will become worse
 lekin obama is baat ko kabhi samajhane ko taiyaar nahin hue yahaan tak ki pichley saal unhone bhartiya chaatro ke bare main jalan se bharaa bayaan diya tha
 Obama said while addressing American school students
 har america chaatr ko man laga kar padhai karnaa chahie
 Otherwise the day is not far when Indian students will grab your jobs
 bhartiya chaatr bahut kaabil hote hai or aap logon ko bhi utana hi kaabil bananaa hoga, nahin to bhavishya main aapako kaaphi dikkatein hongi
 Obama's statement was opposed everywhere
 sabhi kaa kahana tha ki obama apane desh ke chaatro ke man main bharatiyon ke liye nafrat paidaa kar rahe hai
 But this protest had no effect on Obama
 unka aglaa nishaanaa tha bharat kaa medical tourism
 In fact, a large number of American citizens come to India and get their treatment
 isaki vajah ye he ki bharat main ilaaj kaaphi sasta or kai myanon main america se behatar he
 When American hospitals started suffering losses, Obama appealed that American citizens should not go to India but get treatment in America itself
 yani kul milakar obama kaa bharat virdohi cheharaa koi nai baat nahin he, or ab to chunaav sir par hai
 Obama is losing the head, in such a situation, he is once again making the same old bets by making a statement against India

 They have to follow the instructions of AICC and PCC
 ise nahin karne par unke khilaaf eisisi ko karrwai karne kaa adhikaar hoga
 In this proposal, it has also been suggested about the election process of the Congress President
 adhyaksh kaa chunaav yaa to congress ke sabhi panjikrut sadsy karenge yaa phir ek elactoral college chunegaa jisamen vidhansabha congress cameti ke adhyaksh, uske do dailygat, loksabhaa congress cameti ke adhyaksh or uske do dailygat, pradesh congress cameti ke adhyaksh or sabhi kaaryakari sadsy, sabhi zila panchayat adhyaksh, mahanagarapalikaon ke meyar or party ke sabhi saansad or vidhayak shaamil honge
 In the event of election for the Speaker, the candidates who will get more than 20 percent of the votes will become members of the committee
 lekin agar adhyaksh sarvasammati se chunaa gaya yaa kisi ko bhi 20 fisadi se zyaada vot nahin miltaa he to congress adhyaksh varking kamity ke 21 sadasyon ko manonith karegaa jisamen ek upaadhyaksh or 6 mahasachiv shaamil honge
 Under this proposal, 20 percent of the members of the committees are scheduled to be SC, ST, OBC and minorities
 itnaa hi nahin 21 sadasyon main se ek tihaai mahilaayein hongi
 It is also proposed to meet the Working Committee once in every three months

 Apart from AICC, detailed suggestions have been made about the structure of various committees, their responsibilities and duties

 Whether or not some of this proposal prepared on the organizational structure of the party has been considered, nothing is known yet

 In the nearly Rs 1,000 crore Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank scam, the Bombay High Court has ordered an FIR to be registered against around 70 people including Ajit Pawar

 After the Supreme Court verdict, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal immediately tweeted, "this is a big win for the people of Delhi and for democracy
" '' shaam hote-hote cabinet kii baithak bhi ho gai
 Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia held the verdict in Delhi and called the verdict a victory for Delhi and defeated the conspirators
 '' 4 july kaa din dilli sarkaar ke liye raahat lekar aayaa
 All departments and ministries of Delhi were issued guidelines to work as per the Supreme Court's decision
 maahaul kuch aisa bana ki laga trephic main fansi dilli ko raftaar pakadaney kaa green signal mil gaya
 Meanwhile, another tweet by Chief Minister Kejriwal said, "if the Modi government had not tried to wipe out the power of the elected government through illegal instructions, then the precious three years of the government would not have been wasted
" ''jaahir he pichley teen saalon main dilli sarkaar ke kai kaamon main centre se niyukt uparajyapal anil baijal ke adnga daalane kii baat ko lekar hangaamaa kataa
 The limelight between LG and AAP government fiercely and the disrupted development of Delhi was blamed on the Lieutenant Governor
 aise main supreme court kaa faisla vaaki dilli ke liye raahat bharaa he
 It has become clear that the intervention of the Center in Delhi will now be as much as the Constitution has given it authority
 yah tay he ki ab gaiyr kanoonee tarah se adnga daalana centre ke liye mushkil hoga
 But the general public does not understand much legal language
 so logon ke liye is faisle kaa bas itnaa matlab he ki kejariwal ab centre ke changul se mukt ho gaye
 Now they will fulfill all their promises
 auto chalaane vaale trilokapuri ke aseem supreme court ke faisle ke bare main kehete hai, '' ab dilli kii raftaar dekhiegaa, arvind kejariwal to bhale aadmi hai, par bhaajapa nahin chaahati kii ve apane kaam puraa karen or dobaaraa dilli main aaen, ab dekhnaa dilli kaa vikaas kaise hota he
 "so the fruit shop in ITO, Deepak says," Arvind Kejriwal neither had to do anything before nor will he do anything now
 ye keval hangaamaa karnaa jaanate hai, kaam nahin
 In such a situation, now Arvind Kejriwal has to choose whose criteria he meets
 ab jab dilli sarkaar or alji kii sthiti saaf ho gai he to un vaadon ko yaad karnaa jaruri he jo aap sarkaar ke mutabik alji ke adngon kii bhent chadh gaye
 LG came amid these promises of Delhi government
 
 
 to ab ghar-ghar rashan pahunchane main deree nahin karegi dilli sarkarelji ke adnge kii vajah se rukaa hua sabase taaja maamla he ghar-ghar rashan pahunchane kaa
 There was also a recent dispute with the Lieutenant Governor about this
 21 march ko kejariwal ne twit karke kaha tha, ''bahut bura hua, ghar-ghar rashan pahunchane kii yojana ko mananeey uparajyapal ne khaarij kar diya
 i constantly requested him to have a formal meeting before taking any decision, but he did not do so
 vastav main bahut dukhi hum ki itnaa mahatvapurn prastaav raajnneeti kii bhent chadh gaya
 "so now it can be expected that the Delhi government will first implement this ambitious plan
" 
 
 
 So now the whole of Delhi will be in the eyes of CCTV
 In May this year, Kejriwal, his ministers and AAP mlas staged a sit-in near the office of Lt
 Governor Anil Baijal for more than three hours
 unhone alji par aarope lagaaya ki vah puure shahar main 1
 The AAP government's ambitious project of installing 4 lakh CCTV cameras is stuck at the behest of the BJP
 haalanki alji ne is par jawaab diya ki unke paas koi file pahunchi hi nahin
 
 
 
 to bhrasht afasar ab nahin bachengesatta main aane ke baad aap sarkaar ne may 2015 main kaha ki bhrashtachar nirodhi shakha (asibi) kaa niyantran us samay ke uparajyapal najeeb jang ko de die jane kii vajah se bhrasht adhikariyon ke khilaaf sakht karrwai nahin kar paa rahi he
 The AAP government had said at the time that it was not in Sheila Dikshit's time
 dilli sarkaar ne kaha ki centre ne 2014 main dilli main raashtrapati shashan lage rahane ke dauraan ek adhisuchana jari kar asibi kaa niyantran uparajyapal ke haathon main de diya
 While clarifying the constitutional status of Delhi, the Supreme Court has limited the powers of the Lieutenant Governor to three areas, law and order, land and police
 aise main dilli sarkaar kii jeet mauka or chunauti donon lekar ai he
 The AAP government can redeem this opportunity by winning the hearts of Delhiites by fulfilling their promises in the remaining two years
 lekin agar vaade puure nahin hue to arvind kejariwal kii chhavi bakheda khadaa karne vaale mukhyamantri kii rahegi

 The royal house of Amethi is once again in the news
 surkhiyon main isliye, kyonki us gharaane kii viraasat par haq ko lekar jo sangharsh shuru hua, ab wo mahal kii chahardivari ko langhakar sadak par aa gaya he
 What a strange coincidence that the palace towards which one used to look with eyes was against the pride of the palace, today, thousands of eyes are looking towards the same palace, so that the face of the battle between the king and the prince is not known, what should be done, Because whatever happened there just two days ago, he took the life of a soldier in the quarrel of the royalty family
 raja, rani or kaalpanik kahani ke na jane kitne kisse or kahaniyaan aapane suni or sunai hongi, lekin ye kissa-ekadam asli he
 This story comes from the Raj Bhavan of Amethi, about 670 km from Delhi, whose name is Bhupathi Mahal, but who is the real Bhupathi or the owner of this Bhupathi Mahal
 is kahani kaa sara taana bana bas isi ke ird gird hi gum rahaa he
 This is the story of a king, whose queen has accused the king with serious charges
 rajkumaar ne raja ke rishton par sawaal uthaae hai, praja apane raja ke mahal ke saamne aakar khadi ho gai
 There was chaos in the palace due to chaos and then the loud voice which came around the palace could also be considered as rude
 wo mahal achaanak cheekh pukaar se dahal gaya
 This palace was always sparkling with colors
 is vakt yahaan maayusi kaa andhera chaaya hua he
 shaano-shaukat was once the maid of this palace
 ye fatehaal halaat aaj kii bebasii par aansu baha rahe hai
 People living in these palaces once used to feast 56 in silver and gold utensils
 ye pattal aaj ke halaat kii kahani khud suna rahe hai
 When the king of this palace reached himself before his subjects, the scene changed completely
 jo praja apane raja ke saamne sir uthaane kii himmat nahin rakhti thi
 She is defying her status by raising her hands in the sky
 alam ye he ki khud raja or unke mahal kii hifaazat main lagi police ko bich main aana padaa
 There was a lot of furore over the entry of Raja Sanjay Singh and Amita Singh in Amethi Palace, in such a bloodshed that a policeman had to lose his life
 amethi kaa zikr aate hi jehan main gandhi nehru parivaar kii tasviir ubharne lagati he, lekin is sangharsh kaa rishta gandhi nehru parivaar or uski raajnneeti se katai nahin he
 Rather, this conflict is related to the clan that has the status of being the king here
 darasal, amethi ke raja doctor sanjay singh or unki maujuuda patni amita singh par kisi or ne nahin khud unke hi bete anant vikram ne sawaal uthaae hai or in sawaalon kaa taalluk unke haq or hukuk se he
 There was a time when Raja ran Ranjaya Singh ruled in this princely state
 angrejon ke jane ke baad aazaadee ai or risayaton kii hukumat khatm ho gai
 But the pride of this Bhupathi Bhavan still remained the same
 raja rannjay singh ke guzar jane ke baad is mahal main raja kii haisiyat mili raja rannjay singh ke bete doctor sanjay singh ko
 Dr Sanjay Singh, who was a politician, was married in the seventies to Garima Singh, the veteran sportsman of that era and niece of Vishwanath Pratap Singh, popularly known as Raja Manda
 sanjay singh or garima singh ne bhuwan-bhawan ko teen chashmochirag die
 a prince well known for eternal victory and two princesses Shavya and Mahima
 saal 1988 tak sab kuch thikthak chalata rahaa tha tabhi achaanak mashhoor badminton khilaadi saiyad modi kaa lakhanu main katl ho gaya or amethi kaa ye raaj parivaar dushwariyon main ulajh gaya
 In fact, in the murder of Syed Modi, the names of Sanjay Singh and Amita Modi also came before the court as accused
 sanjay singh khud achche badminton khilaadi the or amita modi us vakt rashtriya str par badminton khel rahi thim
 She was also the wife of Syed Modi and Sanjay Singh had a very close relationship with this family
 ek lambii ladaai ke baad aakhirkaar koi saboot na milane kii vajah se sanjay singh or amita modi ko adaalat ne unhen bizzat bari kar diya
 However the same thing has now been challenged by the prince of this Bhupati Bhavan
 saal 1995 aate-aate sanjay singh or amita modi kii nazdikiyon ke kisse jab ujagar hone lage to sanjay singh ne apni patni garima singh ko chhod kar amita modi kaa haath tham liya
 However, this point has its claim to the eternal victory
 amita ke saath sanjay ke rishte ke is khulaase ke baad rajgaraane main rishton kii ek jang chhid gai
 Garima Singh was staying away from Sanjay Singh for the last 18 years with her three children
 haalanki sanjay singh kaa daawa he ki is dauraan unhone apni pehali patni or bacchon ko puraa khyaal rakhaa
 Contrary to Raja Sanjay Singh's claim of Bhupati Bhavan, Garima Singh and his three children have directly blamed Amita Modi for the furore in the royal family
 is rajpariwaar kii sari shanoshaukat us vakt tamaasha ban gai jab kareeb do maheene pehle anant vijay, unki maa garima singh, unki patni or bete ke alaava donon bahanen bhi apane haq kii ladaai ko ladane kii garaj se sidhe rajbhavan ja pahunchi or rajpariwaar main haq kii ladaai do maheene ke andar hi mehalon kii deevaaron se nikalakar beete shanivaar ko sadak par aa gai
 Whether the claim of eternal victory is true or not
 iskaa faisla to adaalat ko hi karnaa he, lekin amethi kii praja pehali baar apane raja ke mukaable rajkumaar ke haq main khadi nazar ai
 The Amethi in which the coin of Raja Sanjay Singh runs
 usee amethi main usee raja ke khilaaf ek shaks ne aawaaj uthaai or us shaks kii uthi hui aawaaj main vahaan ke saikadon bashindon ne bhi apni aawaaj mila di or wo shaks koi or nahin
 Rather the same king has his own blood
 rajkumaar anant vikram singh, lekin baat us vakt zyada bighad gai jab anant vikram apni shikaayat lekar thane tak ja pahunche
 Because this battle of father and son has once again become strong
 modi ke note bain karne ke faisle kaa asar chaahe wo aam aadmi ho yaa koi badi shakhsiyat sabhi par safataur se dekha ja saktaa he
 Recently, many people are trying many tricks in the world to find their black money
 lekin inakam tex ne bhi iske liye puri tarah se qamar kas lee he
 a recent example of this is income tax raid at the home of the producers of the blockbuster hit 'baahubali'
 'bahubali'ke mekars jald'bahubali' kaa sikvalka kaam puraa karne main jute hai or jaahir si baat he is badi bajet vaali film ke liye nirmaataaon ne distributors se baari rakam bhi uthaai hogi
 The Income Tax Department was too late to realize that they raided the film's producers' homes and offices without delay
 sutron ke mutabik inakam tex kii ore se 'bahubali' ke producers sobhu yarlagadda or prasad devineni ke offis or ghar par ek saath chapa maaraa gaya he
 Talking to India today, Telugu producer-director Tammaredi Bhardwaj has condemned the move by the income tax department, saying that the producer has been given the charge by the income tax department
 yahaan tak ki industry main koi bhi produsar is tarah ke gaiyr kanoonee kaaryon main shaamil nahin he
 He also said that the producers maintain all the documents
 'aapako bataa den ki box offis par film industry main kamai ke maamle main kai record bana chuki film ne duniyabar main 600 karod rupee se bhi zyada kii kamai kii thi
 Now the work of this film's sequel 'bahubali 2' is also almost complete
 'bahubali 2' agle saal 28 april ko relies hone ja rahi he
 What is your strategy for winning the Madhya Pradesh Assembly elections? This time the strategy is straightforward
 rahul ji ne sabhi pramukh netaaon se ekajute hone ko kaha he or ham sab 8-9 mukhiya milakar jamini str par prachaar main jute hai
 We have done more than 30 rallies so far and public opinion is coming everywhere in our rallies
 janata bijepi ke raaj se trast he or rajya main parivartan tay he
 But what are the issues on which you will surround the Shivraj Singh Chauhan government? Do not know, what development story of Madhya Pradesh is Shivaji selling throughout the country
 jameen par aisa kuch nahin dikhataa
 The law and order of the state has completely broken down
 bijepi kii kathani or kerani main bada fark he
 The Chief Minister has so far made more than 7,000 announcements in Madhya Pradesh and 6,000 of these announcements are in cold storage

 Talk to me about the present and the future
 lekin is baar to madhya pradesh main modi factor bhi kaam kar rahaa he?empi main narendra modi jaisaa koi factor kaam nahin kar rahaa he
 Recall that in 1998, Narendra Modi was the election in-charge of BJP in the state
 us chunaav main bijepi munh kii kha chuki he
 Madhya Pradesh has already rejected Modi 15 years ago
 rahi baat unke vikaas ke daavon kii to modi model khokhla he
 Madhya Pradesh has been placed in the list of the most backward states along with Bihar and Orissa in the latest Reserve Bank report
 kya gehun kii paidaavaar or sinchai kaa rakabaa badaae ko aap khaarij kar sakate hai?agar gehun kii paidaavaar vaaki badi hoti to kisaan zyada bijli maangate, zyada beej kharidte, zyada khaad maangate lekin inamen se kisi cheez kii khapat us anupaat main nahin badi jis anupaat main paidaavaar badaae kaa daawa kiya gaya
 The fact is that the government on the border with other states made purchases from farmers of Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Gujarat in the mandis of Madhya Pradesh and showed their produce increased
 yah madhya pradesh kaa ab tak kaa sabase bada frod he
 What did you do for your state as Union Energy Minister? Under the Rajiv Gandhi Rural Electrification Mission, my ministry spent Rs 2,800 crore
 madhya pradesh ko die
 Also Rs 2,200 crore
 84 chote-majhole kasbon kii bijli vyavastha ke liye die
 NTPC is setting up a 4,600 MW plant in Madhya Pradesh, with an investment of Rs 55,000 crore
 upie sarkaar har saal 14,000 karod ru
 Sending in the state centre jo paisa bhej rahaa he, vah bijepi netaaon kii jeb main ja rahaa he or janata pareshaan he
 This time, what strategy is the Congress planning on candidate selection? Ticket distribution is to be done on Rahul ji's formula
 jo vyakti teen baar chunaav haar chukaa he, use tikat nahin
 Those two consecutive elections have been defeated, they do not have tickets
 yuvaaon ko tarjeeh dena
 One more thing, Rahul ji has clearly said that no regional leader will bring a panel of three names
 varisht netaa ko ek naam dena hoga or jeet kii guarantee bhi khud leni hogi
 Congress will fight this election with full force

 In his blog, Amitabh questioned why there is no body in the Indian film community that stands up against those who attack freedom of expression? Big b said that bodies representing political powers would have their own ideology and manpower And they support the same things which ultimately benefit them
 lekin kalakaar ek rachaanatmak vyakti hota he uskaa raajnneeti se koi matlab nahin hota
 He said that the government has created a constitutional body Central Film Certification Board which investigates these disturbances
 ab kisi film nirmaataa ko apane kaam ko paas karaane ke liye aise kitne nikaayon ke paas janaa hoga
 Amitabh said that if the law says that permission has to be obtained from every political party, every society and every citizen, then film making will no longer be an 'art'

 If you don't like it, don't look
 film dekhne ke baad pasand nahin aaye to isaki aalochana kijiye
 But it is not in our law to attack, sabotage the film and the people involved in it
 ’unhone kaha ki ek baar sensor board ke paas kiye jane or ucch nyaayalay dwaara pradarshit kiye jane kii anumati diye jane ke baad bahut kuch kiye jane kii gunjaaish nahin thi
 The film will be screened and those who are opposing it will come to know that there is nothing in it that they are opposing

 pakistan ke jane maane political analist munir sami ne kaha he ki bharat ne sargical strike kii thi
 In an interview to a TV in Canada, Sami said that what difference does it make to those who are saying in Pakistan that a surgical strike did not happen, people say that if they believe that a surgical strike had occurred then they will How will you answer to your people that how you let the Indian Army come here, what are you? a stick is stuck in his neck, now he is trying to remove it, and is saying that there was no surgical strike
 to bhai aisa nahin he
 Whatever happened on the loc had never happened before, India had never done such an incarceration with you and if India started doing this again and again, it will keep you tired! Sami also said that we have lost the battle four times
 Huh
 agar phir jang hui to iskaa zimmedaar pakistan hi hoga
 Sami also said that both countries should avoid war because the consequences of this would be very bad for both
 sami ne yah bhi kaha ki log kehete hai bharat or pakistan bade mulk hai to main ise nahin maanata, pakistan ek chota mulk he
 By all accounts, this is the war or gambling of all Kashmir which is started by this small country and the small country who has gambled four times has lost it as a war
 san 1948 main haare, 1965 main haare, 1971 main haare or kargil main bhi peeche hatana padaa tha, or yah jua bhi jo khelte hai vah apane paise se nahin khelte hai, duusare mulkon se paise lekar jua khelte hai!sami ne yah bhi kaha ki jab hindustan kii taraf se acchhee bhalee baat shuru hoti he to chaahe vaajapeyi ji ke saath yaa modi ji-nawaz ke saath shuru hoti he to pakistan apni ladkadaati sarkaar ko bachaane ke liye ek pathar kashmir kaa daal detaa he jaise goli phenkate hai, or vah karne ke baad vah us baat ko khud hi uthaata he, or aap ghatnakram dekhen to ittefaq se har baar pakistan ne hi yah sari baat uthaai he!sami ne yah bhi kaha ki is vaqt jo bharat main udham much rahaa he vah pehle nahin hota tha vah isliye ki is baar jo modi sahab ko apane avam kii betahasha bharosa hasil he, ab se pehle bharat jo tha vah aman ke saath kaam karata tha, unke ghar main ja kar bam maar dete the, is dfa unhone sakhti shuru kii he, vah kah rahe hai ham itane aasaan nahin hai jitna aap samajhate hai, or yah hua kyon? to is vaqt jo hua vah isliye ki mumbai par, pathankot, uri par hamalaa or bharat kaa maamla nipatata nahin he, or ham ye sari kahani khud shuru karte hai or chaahate hai ki duniya vaah-vaah kare
 And unfortunately, the world is not doing Pakistan's favor! Sami also said that Pakistan's people are not being told the right thing about the partition of land after independence, if after the partition India If you are in the region, do not stay in your area, but Pakistan is forcibly gambling and thinking that maybe we will win, and this is why Pakistan has freed the jihadi groups Since it has left the country! Pervez consequences Musharraf's statement that the solution of Kashmir dispute as to Pakistan did not resolve that would be very bad
 " is baat par sami ne kaha ki ham baar baar kah rahe hai ki yah jua he or parvej musharraf ne bhi jua khelaa tha kargil main, nawaz sharif kaa takhta palat kiya tha lekin hua kya?munir sami ne bhartiya kashmir main hone vaale human ritis vylation par kaha ki "yah jo musiibat hamane khud hi khadi kii he, burhan vaani ko banane vaala koun he? or vah aapkaa shahid kaise ho gaya? nawaz sharif apni jabaan nahin bol rahe hai, unhen jo parchaa likh kar diya jaataa he use pard dete hai, or naa padhein to unki hukumat gir jaaegi, vah to is dabaav main kar rahe hai, unhen pakistan kii avam kii chintaa nahin he!"sami ne kaha ki baluchistan main jitna julm ho rahaa he ab to uski aadat ho gayi he, or aasaan ho gaya baluchistan main bam phodo or use bharat se link kar do, yah sirf duusare par gaddari kii baat kar sakate hai!sami ne bharat or pakistan ke jang kii ore badhate kadam par kaha ki "modi sahab kaarobaari hai, or vah nahin chaahate kii jang ho, modi sahab ko to majaboor kiya gaya he, lekin ab yah hoga ki jo bharat ne jo ankhamicholi kaa khel he jo bharat ne pehle nahin kiya tha vah ab rozaana karegaa

 Saudi Arabia understands India's stand on Kashmir and believes that what India is doing is doing for the betterment of its population
 yah baat buudhvaar ko yahaan ek bhartiya sutara ne kahi
 The source made the remark when Prime Minister Narendra Modi held extensive discussions with Saudi Arabia's King Salman bin Abdul Aziz and Wali Ahad Mohammed bin Salman a day earlier

 He said that Kashmir was not discussed during the bilateral talks between Modi and the top leadership of Saudi Arabia on Tuesday

 shantipurna sampann hue matdaan main sikar loksabhaa seat par64
 77 percent of the people cast their votes
 ab 23 may ko chunaav ke nattejey aaenge
 CPI-M candidate Amaram is trying his luck in this seat in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, while Bahujan Samaj Party has given the ticket to Sita Devi
 vahiin congress ke tikat par subhash mahaaria chunaav lard rahe hai
 BJP has made Sumedhanand Saraswati its candidate
 rajasthan main donon bade raajnneetik dal congress or bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ne aam chunaavon ke liye target 25 kaa mishan lekar ranneeti taiyaar kiya he
 However, the results of the recently concluded assembly elections have changed the political equation of the state
 kyonki congress ne bijepi ko satta se bedakhal kar rajasthan main sarkaar banaai he
 Talking about the Shekhawati region of Rajasthan, this area has been a Congress stronghold since the beginning
 lekin 2014 kii modi lahar main bijepi ne is myth ko todate hue congress kaa yah majboot kila dhaha diya
 By the way, the Lok Sabha in Shekhawati zone consists of three seats - Jhunjhunu, Sikar and Churu
 lekin pradesh or desh kii jat siyasat main sikar kii apni alag pahchaan he
 The Jat-dominated Sikar district of Shekhawati is known as the district of soldiers in the state
 sikar kii ek alag pahchaan isliye bhi he kyonki is kshetra kaa istemaal tamaam siyaasi dal desh kii jat siyasat main bada sandesh dene ke liye karte rahe hai
 Whether it is the announcement of Jat reservation from Sikar by former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee or why Congress leader Balram Jakhar and former Deputy Prime Minister Chaudhary Devi Lal should come from Haryana to contest from here
 sikar ke vartmaan saansad swami sumedhanand saraswati bhi sikar se na hokar padosi rajya haryana se taalluk rakhte hai or jat samudaay ke hai
 Ramrajya Party won the Sikar Lok Sabha seat in the first Lok Sabha election held in 1952 after independence
 iske baad 1957 or 1962 ke chunaav main lagaataar do baar congress ke rameshwaralal tontiyaan yahaan se saansad bane
 While Gopal Sabu won the 1967 election from the Bharatiya Jana Sangh, the Congress returned once again in 1971
 1977 kii janata lahar main congress yah seat bachaa nahin pai or bhartiya lokdal ke tikat par jagadish prasad ne baaji maari
 In the 1980 elections, Kumbharam Arya of Janata party-s won elections from here
 1984 main congress ke kaddavar netaa rahe balram jakhad ne bijepi ke bade brahman netaa dhanashyaam tiwadi ko haraakar sikar main jeet kaa paracham laharaaya
 But in the 1989 Lok Sabha elections, former Deputy Prime Minister Chaudhary Devi Lal made the contest interesting by beating on the face of Jakhar
 haalanki jakhad yah chunaa devilal se haar gaye
 But in the 1991 election, Balram Jakhar of Congress once again returned to this seat
 1996 ke chunaav main bhi congress ko is seat par jeet hasil hui
 But after this, BJP won the Sikar parliamentary seat for three consecutive times when BJP Subhash Maharia won the victory in the Lok Sabha elections of 1998,1999, 2004
 haalanki 2009 ke chunaav main mahariya, congress ke mahadev singh khandela se chunaav haar gaye
 But once again in 2014 Modi wave, BJP captured this seat
 sikar ke siyaasi sameekaran haal ke dinon main badale hai kyonki bijepi ke teen baar ke saansad rahe subhash mahariya ab apane bhai samet congress main shaamil ho gaye hai

 37% are Scheduled Tribes
 yahaan kii kul aabaadi kaa 82 fisadi hindu or 12 fisadi muslim hai
 Sikar is a Jat dominated region, so Congress and BJP have fielded mostly Jat candidates from here
 saal 2014 ke chunavi aankadon ke mutabik sikar sansadeey seat par matadaataaon kii sankhya 17,70,424 jisamen 9,44,231 purush or 8,26,193 mahila matadaata shaamil hai
 The Sikar Lok Sabha constituency consists of 8 assembly seats - Sikar, Laxmangarh, Neemkathana, Dhod, Srimadhopur, Khandela, Dantaramgarh and Chaumun
 isamen choumun vidhansabha jaipur kaa hissaa he
 Chaumu has a sizeable population of Mali community, so the Mali vote plays an important role in this area
 haal main sampann hue vidhansabha chunaav main kagress party ne sikar sansadeey seat ke tahat aane vaali 8 vidhansabha siton main se 6 seat par kabja jamaaya he, jabaki khandela vidhansabha seat par nirdaleey or choumun seat par bijepi ne jeet darj kii

 While former BJP MP Subhash Maharia, in third place, was 17 while contesting as an independent
 7 fisadi vot hasil kiye
 While Swami Sumedhanand Saraswati got 4,99,428 votes from BJP, Pratap Singh Jat from Congress secured 2,60,232 votes and remained second
 vahiin nirdaleey pratyaashee ke taur par subhash mahariya ko 1,88,841 vot mili
 Sikar MP Sumedhanand Saraswati belongs to the neighboring state of Haryana and belongs to the Jat caste
 lekin saalon se sikar ke paas piparali kasbe main apana ashram banaakar rah rahe hai
 Sumedhanand Saraswati is named as the MP with the least wealth
 2014 ke chunavi halafname main unki sampatti maatr 34,311 rupee thi
 Sumedhanand had 92 percent presence in the Lok Sabha
 is dauraan unhone kul 87 bahes main hissaa liya or 544 sawaal puche
 He spent 77 percent of his allotted MP Development Fund for the development work of his parliamentary constituency

 To stay updated with the latest news of the general election, subscribe to Aaj Tak's election special news letter bijepi kisaan morcha ke adhyaksh virendra singh mast ne kisaan andolanon kaa samarthan kiya, lekin unhone vipakshi dalon kii ore se in andolanon ko raajnneetik manch banaae jane kaa virodh kiya or kaha ki kisaanon ke andolan ke saath dhokhaa kiya gaya
 Virendra Singh Mastane said, 'any movement is a natural process of Indian democracy
 kisi andolan se main asahmat nahin hota hum, lekin meri aapatti yah he ki aise kai andolan samasya ke samaadhaan ke bajaae gumraah kar dete hai
 i object to those who cheat with the movement
 'unhone aage kaha, 'apni samasya ke samaadhaan ke liye dilli aae kisaanon or kisaan sanghathanon se nivedan kiya ki aap jahaan bhi bulaayenge main samvaad karne ke liye taiyaar hum
 i am ready to provide a solution
 sarthak suzav bhi maange lekin yah baat aage nahin badi
 Any problem encountered in the world has been solved
 'kisanmorcha ke adhyaksh ne kaha ki yahaan deshbhar ke kisaan aae
 Dialogue could solve their problem
 hamane samvaad ke liye apil bhi kii lekin kisi ne hamen aamantrit nahin kiya
 Politician Virendra Singh Mast on the stage of the movement says that the leader of opposition in the peasant movement started calling for change of power on the platform
 jo kisaan apni samasya ke liye aae the unki samasya peeche chhot gai or vipaksh ke log apni baaten karne lage
 My objection is that the opposition people misguided the peasant movement
 kisaan andolan ke saath dhokhaa kiya
 Mast says that farmers who are preparing political land in the name of farmers movement are being betrayed
 kisaan andolankisanonki samasya ke niraakaran yaa samvaad kaa jariya banane kii bajaae use upie kaa raajnneetik manch bananaa bilkul thik nahin he
 This is utterly unfair and misleading the farmers of the country
 kisaanon ke haath maayusivirendra singh mast kaa kahana he ki deshbhar se aae 200 se zyada kisaan sanghathanon or kisaanon ke andolan ke naam par kisaan ko kuch bhi hasil nahin hua
 The way political opportunism is shown in its name
 usase andolan main aae kisaanon ke haath maayusi lagi he
 He had no idea that such a deception would be done to him in the name of the peasant movement
 mast kaa yah bhi kahana he ki centre or rajya sarkarein kisaanon ko lekar agar koi andekhi kar rahi hai to use bhi andolan ke manch par samvaad ke jariye bataaya ja saktaa tha
 In such a situation, instead of making the peasant movement in the interest of farmers, it was not right to make it a political platform
 bijepi kisaan morcha ke adhyaksh ne kaha ki vah deshbhar main aise chalaave or bhulaave se bhare andolan se kisaanon ko bachaane ke liye is mudde ko uthaaenge
 Those who do not drink much water, they must read this news
 darasal, ek mahila ne daawa kiya he ki lagaataar chaar hafton tak ek din main teen litre pani pine se uski jindagi puri tarah se badal gai
 The 42-year-old woman is named Sarah, who shares her experience like this: There was a great similarity between me and the camel, i thought i could live long without water
 main pani kaa ek gilaas subah, ek lunch ke dauraan or ek dinar ke baad piti thi
 i thought it was enough, but it was not right
 kai saalon tak sir dard or apach kii shikaayat ke baad maine neurologist or nutrishanist se baat kii
 Both of them told me that i should drink three liters of water a day for the body to function properly
 iske baad maine ek experiment karne kaa faisla kiya
 i thought what happens if i drink so much water for 28 days? The results were shocking
 pehla haftamujhe sirdard kam rahane laga tha
 By drinking water again and again, the toxins inside my body were coming out through urine
 main saalon se subah uthakar yoga karti thi, lekin pichley chah maheenon se meraa sharir sakht ho gaya tha
 But drinking water made my body flexible again
 doosraa haftaab mere chehre kaa rang sudharne laga or skin tone bhi pehle se thik ho gaya tha
 Although i still had wrinkles on my face, but now they had become a bit lighter than before
 mere chehre ke dane ab kam hone lage the or ankhon ke kaale ghere dhundhale ho rahe the
 i have not had a headache for a week
 yahi nahin mere pati ne mujhase kaha ki meri jaanghon se fat kam ho gaya he
 The third week, dark circles and wrinkles under his eyes had disappeared
 meri ek dost beauty therepist he, usne mujhe bataaya ki aisa isliye ho rahaa he kyonki pani meri twachaa ko rionret karne main madad kar rahaa he
 i also notice that now after waking up in the morning, i have stopped rubbing my eyes
 pehle meri ankhen rukhi or neend se bhari hui hoti thim, lekin ab aisa nahin he
 The fourth week i could not believe the change in my face
 main bilkul alag dikh rahi thi
 The dark circles and facial pimples had completely disappeared
 meri twachaa bilkul bacchon jaisi mulaayam ho gai thi
 i was feeling thinner and more fit
 mere zyada pani pine se mere dost phikrmand rahete the
 But i was under the supervision of my doctor and following his guidelines
 isliye main unhen yakeen dilaati rahati thi ki unhen phikr karne kii koi jarurat nahin he
 Now whatever happens, i will not stop drinking three liters of water every day
 or har mahila ko bhi aisa hi karne kaa suzav detii hum (haa, doctor se salaah lene ke baad hi aisa karen)
 My husband and friend say that i am 10 years younger now
 aise main aisa koun hoga jo itane behtareen parinaam ke baad ise apnaanaa nahin chahega? a Congress leader was shot dead by unknown assailants on a motorcycle
 is hatya ke baad party ke kaaryakartaaon ne jile main hinsak pradarshan kiya jisamen chaar pulicekarmiyon samet nau log ghayal ho gayi
 Superintendent of Police Tanmay Roy Chaudhary said that three people on a motorcycle were shot dead near the bundled diesel engine factory last night when Dilip Paswan (55)

 Congress leaders are keeping an eye on the ongoing fighting in the Samajwadi Party
 shanivaar subah jab samaajawaadee party ke netaa akhilesh ke ghar pahunch kar mukhyamantri main apana vishwaas jataayaa to congress ke netaaon ne bhi akhilesh kii tarifon ke pul baandh die
 Senior Congress leader Salman Khurshid while talking to 'aaj Tak' said that despite the difficulties, Akhilesh tried to run Uttar Pradesh well
 hamako isse khushi he jis tarah se samaajawaadee party ke netaaon ne akhilesh kaa samarthan kiya he
 Khurshid said that it is clear that Akhilesh will emerge as a strong leader of the future
 mana ja rahaa he ki congress kahin na kahin akhilesh ke saath chunaav main jane kaa man bana chuki he
 At the same time, in a special conversation with 'aaj Tak', senior Congress leader PL Punia said yes to the matter of alliance
 haalanki unhone kaha ki rahul gandhi rashtriya netaa hai or vah pehle bhi akhilesh ke kaamkaaj kii tarif kar chuke hai
 On the question of why Jayant Chaudhary is to mediate, he said that if the Congress has to negotiate with Akhilesh, it will appoint a leader of its own
 haalanki unhone kaha ki ekala chalo re he kaaryakarta kii maang he
 As far as the workers are concerned, the Congress workers want the party to fight alone on every seat
 unhone kaha kii congress party har seat par akele ladane ko taiyaar he
 If there is an alliance, then it will be an alliance with the public and not with Akhilesh or any leader
 itnaa bolnaa hi kaaphi he ki donon netaa ek-duusare ko pasand karte hai
 Leave it in time to decide what the party high command decides in the interest of the party
 barsaat kaa mausam aate hi machharon kii sankhya achaanak se bad jaati he
 To avoid mosquitoes, whichever corner you hide, one mosquito pierces your body with your trunk
 musiibat ye he ki aap lakh haath chalie yaa phir mashin lagaaie ye kahin na kahin se aa hi jate hai
 They have no time
 kai baar aapane apane offis main bhi inkaa dansh saha hoga
 Even after a million cleanings, they are never completely finished
 malaria or dengue jaisi bhayanak bimariyonko failaane vaale yemchhar ghar ke har kone main maujuud hote hai
 They escape alive despite the use of mosquito nets, sprays, machines or other chemical substances
 par agar aap in gharelu upayon ko apanaayenge to yakeen kiijie machhar khud hi aapse duuri bana lenge:1
 People who use garlic more in their food than consuming garlic, mosquitoes stay away from them
 darasal, lahasun main tej gandh hoti he
 Due to which mosquitoes stay away
 aise main jo shaks apni diet main lahasun kaa adhik istemaal karata he swaabhaavik rup se machhar usase dur rahete hai
 2
 bear pine se bachenbhale hi aapako is baat par yakeen karnaa mushkil ho rahaa ho lekin ye sach he
 a 2002 study proved that mosquitoes are attracted to beer drinkers
 aise main agar aap machharon se trast aa chuke hai to apni bear ko niyantrit karnaa bhi behad jaruri he
 3
 vitamin b ke seven seagar aap pratidin 100 se 150mg vitamin B1 kaa seven karte hai to aapke sharir kii gandh badal jaaegi
 Mosquitoes do not like this smell
 haalanki ye purna rup se pramanik nahin he par aap doctor ke paraamarsh se vitamin kaa seven kar sakate hai
 4
 mombatti jalaakar yaa phir kapur jalakardhuen se machhar dur bhaagate hai
 In such a situation, if mosquitoes have camped in your room, then burn a candle there
 agar aapako citronela candal mil jaae to or bhi behatar he
 Apart from this, mosquitoes also run away from the smoke of camphor
 5
 Eucalyptus or lemon oil is the most effective way to stay away from mosquitoes
 aap eucalyptus yaa phir lemon oil ko sharir ke khule bhaag par mel len
 Mosquitoes will not burst around you due to its smell
 ye gharelu upaay machharon ko dur rakhane ke saath hi is baat kii bhi santushti dete hai ki inke istemaal se kisi prakaar kaa koi sideeffect nahin hoga

 That is, a Muslim woman now 23 compared to a Hindu woman
 8 fisadi zyada bachche paidaa karti he
 How it became possible, according to the National Family Health Survey, by increasing the age of childbearing and the difference between children, in many countries the birth rates have been reduced in many countries by increasing the age of motherhood and widening the gap between two children

 Most Muslims abstained from education because they felt that it was not their job to do a job
 yahi vajah he ki zyaadaatar musalamaanon kii pehali peedi padhai kar rahi he or ghar kii mahilaayein aisa karne ke liye prerit kar rahi hai
 Farhin Naz, the project manager of the Pragati Foundation, also believes that the tendency of keeping families small has increased among Muslims

 apni academy gairi karston india ke liye rashtravyapee pratibha khoj abhiyaan ke sandarbh main rajdhani dilli pahunche karston ne yah baat kahi
 Kirsten said he loves working with Kohli and India's upcoming England tour will be exciting

 "kirsten said," Kohli has continued to improve his game and he is getting better
 mujhe unke saath kaam karnaa pasand he, kyonki vah is khel ke bare main or bhi siikhnaa chaahate hai or har sarvshereshth khilaadi yaheen karata he
 Talking about the popularity of the Formula-20 format and its impact on traditional cricket formats, Mumbai Indians, who have become 'IPL' jugglers' team, said that this short format of cricket is more connected to the younger generation
 karston ne kaha, 'mujhe tii-20 cricket acha lagata he
 It is associated with the younger generation
 yah kaaphi manoranjak he or mere bacchon ko anya praroopon ke mukaable tii-20 cricket match dekhnaa zyada acha lagata he
 He said, 'T20 will always be there

 People who have grown up watching Test cricket will like it
 mujhe test cricket ko lekar sabase adhik chintaa is baat kii he ki england or australia ke alaava is praaroop ke liye darshakon kii sankhya adhik nahin he
 Kirsten, who is currently involved in the 11th season of the Indian Premier League (IPL), is struggling with team Royal Challengers Bangalore, refused to talk more about the poor performance of the team

 Participating in Delhi Aaj Tak's Entrepreneur Summit, Lamod MD, MD, a big name in the fashion world in delhi-ncr, says that success requires honesty and honesty
 hamane jab kaam shuru kiya to kisi din chuttee nahin lee
 Worked continuously for 365 days of the year, we also worked on the days of Diwali and Holi
 aaj kamyaabi milane ke baad bhi lagaataar nai soch ke saath kaam karte hai jisase bazaar main nayaapan bana rahe
 AK Gupta at the Entrepreneur Summit of Delhi Aaj Tak said, "we did a lot of work to name the company to start the company 3 decades ago and after doing research for months, decided that the company should be named Lamode
 yah ek french naam he or iskaa arth he da modern
 After the love marriage, the father removed, he told about the struggles of his early life that he got into a fight with the family after doing the love marriage
 mere pita jo principal the, behad kade kaayade-kanoon vaale the or unhone mujhe ghar se baahar nikaal diya
 After this, there was a lot of struggle in life
 lekin ham ruke nahin or aage sangharsh karte rahe
 AK Gupta at the Entrepreneur Summit of Delhi Aaj Tak said, 'after struggling for some time, the wife told that if i have Rs 5000 left, then we started sewing work at home
 shuruyaat bacchon ke kurta-pajame se kiya
 Used to sew and sell on his own
 phir kuch mahilaon ko bhi jod liya
 He said that 35 years ago there were usually readymade shirts in the market, but there were no pants
 to hamane pant nikaala jiskaa rispons shandaar rahaa
 After that we decided to get a name registered, then we went and gave Rs 5000 to the lawyer to get my company name registered
 tab patni ne kaha ki tumne 5 hajaar rupee sirf naam ke registration main de die
 'we never took a holiday' said AK Gupta, MD, Lamode Fashions Pvt Ltd, that we opened our first show in Roop Munirka
 iske baad aaj kii taarikh main puure dilli-ensiaar main 40 sho room chal rahe hai
 The special thing is that our show rooms are not running in a rented house, all the show rooms are in their houses
 ab bacchon kii shaadi karne ke baad eke gupta ne kaha ki mujhe kuch nayaa karnaa he
 Thinking of innovating lagaataar nayaa karte rahanaa chahta hum
 He said that in his 35 years of business, he never set up a cell in Lamode
 hamane apane saamaanon par kabhi bhi daam badhaakar nahin lagaaya
 First increase the price of something and then sell it in the name of cell by lowering the rate
 aisa hamane kabhi nahin kiya
 He further said, 'people say that now that you are 62, if you go out for a walk, my office is the biggest place for me to roam
 main landan gaya or duniya ke kai bade shaharon main bhi ghoomane gaya, lekin mujhe dilli se acha koi shahar nahin laga

 com / kvxivriu0q— Ayushmann Khurrana (@ayushmannk)october 8, 2018nina ne kaha, "maatrutiv kaa anubhav karne vaali kisi bhi mahila ke liye yah ek khaas pal hota he
 There can be no better way to celebrate this good news in the presence of my close friends and family
 "amit ravindranath sharma nirdeshit main bani is film main sanya malhotra lead actress hai
 The movie trailer is being liked a lot
 film kii dilachasp kahani shantnu shrivastav or akshat ne likhi he
 Neena Gupta is seen on screen after a long time
 badhai homen ek baar phir ayushmaan khurana kaa kamedi andaaj darshakon ko lubhaa saktaa he
 It is not possible that they have come to a stage
 abhi maah bhar pehle tak koi soch bhi nahin saktaa tha ki lalu prasad yadav, mulaayam singh yadav or ramvilas paswan milakar 'chauthaa morcha' banaaenge
 Each of these leaders, who was part of the original batch of Mandalists, thought that he was bigger than the rest in stature and status
 isliye 1990 main vishwanath pratap singh kii rashtriya morcha sarkaar ke patan ke baad in teenon ko ek-duusare se alag hona hi tha
 But since then a lot of water has flowed into Gomti and Kosi and the trio, who did not even look at each other in meetings, are hugging each other in front of TV cameras due to circumstances
 chunavi majaburiyon ne achaanak hi inhen ek saath laa khadaa kiya he
 Lalu Yadav's well-known muslim-yadav (mai) mail formula in Bihar is weakening and suddenly the nervousness of the Railway Minister against Congress can be seen clearly
 unhone congress par tamaam aaropon ke saath yah aarope bhi laga daalaa ki babari masjid vidhwans ke liye congress bhi utani hi jimmedaar he jitani bhaajapa
 It is no surprise that Lalu is doing all such rhetoric to woo Muslim voters, who account for a sizeable 16 percent of Bihar's voters
 varshon tak lalu bhaajapa netaa laalkrishna adwani par nishaanaa sadhate rahe or 1990 main unki giraftaar kaa shrey lete nahin thakte the
 Now in 2009, he has changed the target
 shaayad kuch logon ko aashcharya hua hoga, jab lalu ne ghoshnaa ki ''agar ve grih mantri hote to varun gandhi par roller chalava dete
 Lalu's attack on the Congress is a tremendous change as he has been a trusted partner of the Congress
 lekin yah badlaav akaaran nahin he
 Lalu's scathing attack on the Congress reflects his frustration, as Muslims in his home state have now found many alternatives in place of his Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD)
 iske alaava maujuuda samay bhi myne rakhata he
 Lalu has intensified his attack against the Congress after the first phase of voting, indicating that he is not benefitting more
 isiilie ve uski bharpai ke liye puri koshish kar rahe hai, kyonki bihar main ab bhi 27 siton par matdaan hona baaki he, spasht he ki lalu prasad yadav, jo hameshaa hi muslim matadaataaon ko apni rajnatik yojana kaa aadhaar samajhate rahe hai, baichaiyn ho gaye hai
 They are trying their best to draw Muslims towards themselves by adopting negative attitude against everyone
 apane puure kareer main lok janashakti party (lojpa) pramukh ramvilas paswan apni ashaavadita ke liye jane jate rahe hai-ek aisa shaks, jo avasar kaa puraa laabh uthaanaa jaanata he
 Paswan has managed to get a place in the Union Cabinet with a total of four mps gathered from him
 chunaav baad ke paridrishy main bhi ummid kii ja rahi he ki paswan lalu or mulaayam ke saath hi rahenge lekin in donon ke saath doobane kaa khatra hua to ve rajg ke saath jane se bhi shaayad parhez nahin karenge
 Though he has good relations with the leaders of the Left Front, but if the Left Front forms a government with Mayawati's Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), they will probably shy away from going with it
 is baar unki party bihar main keval 12 siton par chunaav lard rahi he, isliye pradhanmantri pad paane kii laalasaa rakhane vaale paswan chunaav ke baad sambhawatah kingmekar kii bhoomika main na aa paaen
 But in the post-election scenario, where even a party with an MP can pretend to be a kingmaker, Paswan can prove to be crucial, especially if his LJP wins three or four seats
 aisi sthiti main kendriya rasayan evam urvarak va ispaat mantri kii bhoomika ahm ho sakati he
 But for Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh, it is truly a litmus test
 haal hi main unke kareeb darjan bhar saansad unka saath chhod chuke hai or unka muslim janaadhar bhi khisak rahaa he
 His closeness, which began with the Congress during the trust vote in July last year, is also over
 bhaajapa se alag hue kalyaan singh ke saath samaajawaadee party (sapa) kii dosti unke liye mahangi sabit ho rahi he
 To strengthen his party's prospects, Mulayam fielded Sanjay Dutt but the Sukhim court rejected Dutt's candidature and Mulayam had to rethink his strategy
 ek saath chunaav ladane or do rajyon main milakar chunavi reliyon ko sambodhit karne ke daavon ke vipareet ye teenon netaa bihar or uttar pradesh main apni-apni sthiti majboot karne main lage hai
 They only show off their friendship at press conferences
 chauthe morche ke peeche lalu, paswan or mulaayam kaa iraadaa sirf chunaav baad raajnneeti main zyada se zyada hissaa paane kaa he lekin yah loksabhaa chunaavon main in teenon netaaon ke pradarshan par nirbhar karegaa
 The only meaning of this entire exercise is to create a strong platform so that the three satraps can bargain hard with the UPA or Third Front after the elections
 bihar main lalu or paswan ke bich dooriyaan khatm hone va congress ke saath katutaa badhane or udhar mulaayam kii ore se bhi congress par nishaanaa saadhane se yah baat lagbhag spasht he ki chauthaa morcha ko chunaav baad jarurat padane par teesraa morcha (basapa ko chhodkar) ke saath jane main koi hichak nahin hogi
 Mulayam has embraced his 40-year-old rival BJP leader Kalyan Singh to increase the support base among the obcs and give a tough challenge to the BSP
 lekin unhone jabase kalyaan singh, jo babari masjid vidhwans ke liye jimmedaar maane jate hai, se haath milaayaa, musalmaan unase naaraaz hone lage hai
 Many Muslim leaders of the SP have revolted against the SP and the Ulema and other religious leaders have declared their opposition to Mulayam and his candidates in all the constituencies
 mulaayam kii ore se aag bujhane ke liye baar-baar die gaye spashtikaran kaa bhi koi phayda nahin ho rahaa he, pehle ke vipareet is baar uttar pradesh ke purv mukhyamantri bachaav kii mudra main aa gaye hai
 In the 2004 elections, SP had the highest number of mps till date, of which seven were Muslims
 party ne 68 siton par apane ummidavaar khadey kiye the, jabaki basapa ne 80 ummidavaar utaare the, jinamein se 19 ko jeet mili thi
 The SP has been shocked that a dozen mps, including big leaders like Beni Prasad Verma, Raj Babbar, Salim Sherwani and Atik Ahmed, have left him
 varsh 2007 ke vidhansabha chunaav main basapa ke 31 muslim ummidavaar vijayi hue the jabaki sapa ke keval 20 muslim ummidavaar chunaav jite the, jo is baat kaa sanket tha ki party kaa muslim aadhaar khisak rahaa tha
 Seeing the displeasure of Muslims with Mulayam, Mayawati has fielded 17 Muslim candidates, taking an aggressive stand
 uttar pradesh kii mukhyamantri or basapa pramukh unhen apni ore khinchne main lagi hai
 He even called mafia don Mukhtar Ansari, the BSP candidate from Varanasi, "the messiah of the poor"
 agar chauthe morcha kaa gathan kuch darshata he to vah he samaajawaadee parivaar ke in teenon netaaon kii bechaini, jo is ummid se ek-duusare kaa haath tham rahe hai ki ek saath milakar ve desh ke do sabase bade rajyon kii 120 siton main bada hissaa hasil kar saken
 He hopes to get about 50 of these seats so that he can negotiate the formation of the next government
 ummid se kam siten milin to lalu or mulaayam ke saamne haath par haath rakhkar baithne ke sivaa koi chaara nahin rahegaa, jabaki paswan apana phayda dekhakar kisi ke bhi saath ja sakate hai
 Amitabh Srivastava with, in Patna and Subhash Mishra in Lucknow: India Today pakistan ke purv raashtrapati parvej musharraf ne pradhanmantri narendra modi par nishaanaa saadhaa he
 They have said that i cannot see Pakistan being ashamed
 modi pakistan or muslim virdohi netaahain
 Their coming to Lahore is fine, but nothing has been achieved

 The minister told reporters, "we always want Rahul Gandhi to join the government

 After removing Article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir, PM Narendra Modi addressed the country
 piem narendra modi ne ghati se anuchhed 370 hataane ke laabh bataae
 PM Narendra Modi said that such a system was in force in Jammu and Kashmir due to which our siblings of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh were deprived of many rights
 ye unke vikaas main badi baadha ban rahaa tha
 The PM said that a new era is now beginning in Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh

 In a message to the nation, PM Modi promised to create new Kashmir and new Ladakh
