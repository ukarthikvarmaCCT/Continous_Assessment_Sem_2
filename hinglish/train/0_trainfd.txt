 com / ndicrgwuph— Poonam Pandey (@ipoonampandey)june 26, 2014 If you think that dieting can help you stay fit, then pay attention to this new research which suggests that dieting can lead to cancer, diabetes and other deadly diseases by secreting toxins in the body
 america, norge or dakshin korea ke shodhakartaaon kii aguwai main ek antarrashtriya shodh dal ne paaya he ki vajan kam hone se hanikaarak or pradooshak tatv rakt main mil jate hai jo saamaanya taur par sharir kii vasa main sangrahit rahete hai
 According to research, if the secretion of toxins from the fat tissue is lost, it can be harmful to lose weight and this increases the speed of accumulation of organic pollutants
 is shodh ke liye shodhakartaaon ne 40 varsh se adhik aayu ke 1099 logon ke vajan kaa das saal tak adhyayan kiya or saat sarvaadhik khatarnaak pradooshak tatwon par nigaraanee rakhane ke liye unke kai baar rakt pareekshan kiye gaye
 Researchers found high amounts of certain chemicals in the blood of people who lost weight
 ye rasayan stan cancer, alzimer, mastishk ko kshati pahunchane vaale or snaayu tantra ko prabhavit karne vaali bimariyon ko paidaa karne vaale the

 a partial solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between the Sun and the Earth in such a way that some part of the Sun appears to be hidden under the Moon when viewed from Earth
 gupta ne bataaya ki varsh 2012 main chaar june ko aanshik chandragrahan hoga
 However, this exciting view of the sun, earth and moon will not be seen in India, because the day will be in the country at the time of this astronomical event

 At this time the sunlight falling on the moon appears to be partially cut off and the eclipse can be seen as a blurred shadow falling on the moon

 — Imran Khan (@imrankhanpti)july 24, 2018haalanki kaha ja rahaa he ki yah chunaav sirf dikhavabhar he
 Such speculations are being made that this time the election is not just going to be an election in Pakistan
 pakistan ke nae wajire ajam yani pradhanmantri kaa sellection chunaav ke jariye pakistani avam nahin, balki pakistani sena karne ja rahi he
 Imran Khan is being described as a favorite of the Pak Army
 kuch din pakistan ke ek bade angreji akhbaar ke adhikari ne ek intervyuu main aarope lagaaya he ki paak sena vahaan ke chunaavon main hastkshep kar rahi he or cricketer se rajaneta bane imran khan or unki party pitiai kaa samarthan kar rahi he

 'khalanaayak' or 'saajan' jaisi superhit filmon main saath najar aa chuki dhak-dhak girl maadhuri dikshit or sanjay dutt ke bich afaire kii khabaren 90 ke dashak main kaaphi garm rahi thim
 As such, the story ended at that time and now both Madhuri Dixit and Sanjay Dutt are moving forward in their married life
 lekin saalon puraane is kathith afaire par ek baar phir baaten ho rahi hai or uskaa kaaran he sanjay dutt par banane vaali byopic
 There are reports that the director Rajkumar Hirani, who is making this biopic, spoke to Madhuri Dixit at the time of casting
 media reports ke anusaar maadhuri dikshit ne is byopic main is saalon puraane afaire ke bare main na dikhaane kii baat kii he
 However, it is not clear whether this aspect of Sanjay Dutt's life will be discussed in the film
 tippaniyan Recently while talking to Mid Day, Madhuri Dixit said, 'these things no longer have any meaning
 in par (sanjay dutt) charchaa karnaa hi bekaar he
 When he was asked about Sanjay Dutt's coming to Biopic, he said, 'I don't know where such rumors are flying
 kisi bhi sthiti main mujhe ab aisi baton se koi fark nahin padataa
 'please tell that Rajkumar Hirani has made' Munna Bhai MBBS 'and' Lage Raho Munna Bhai 'with Sanjay Dutt earlier
 sanjay dutt kii is byopic main ranbir kapur sanjay dutt bane najar aaenge
 Their relationship is said to have ended after the arrest of Sanjay Dutt in 1993
 maadhuri dikshit unase milane jail bhi nahin gai thim
 Apart from Ranbir, Manisha Koirala and Karishma Tanna are also going to be seen in this film on the life of Sanjay Dutt
 sanjay dutt kii byopic main kuch aise najar aaenge ranbir kapur
 Please tell that Sanjay Dutt married Richa Sharma in 1987, who later moved to America and died here in 1996 from cancer
 maadhuri or sanjay dutt ne apane is rishte par kabhi muhar nahin lagaai thi lekin yah mana jaataa tha ki 'khalanaayak' ke baad yah rishta khatm ho gaya tha kyonki isi film ke baad sanjay dutt ko 1993 bombai blast ke liye giraftaar kar liya tha
 Later Sanjay Dutt was sentenced to 5 years for possessing illegal weapons
 haal hi main mid de se baat karte hue maadhuri dikshit ne kaha, 'in baton kaa ab koi matlab nahin rah jaataa he
 It is useless to discuss them (sanjay Dutt)
 ' unase jab sanjay dutt kii boyapik main aane kii baat poochi gai to unhone kaha, 'mujhe nahin pataa aisi afvaahen kahaan se ud rahi hai
 In any case, i do not mind such things now
 ' bataa den ki rajkumaar hiraani isse pehle sanjay dutt ke saath 'munna bhai embibies' or 'lage raho munna bhai' bana chuke hai
 In this biopic of Sanjay Dutt, Ranbir Kapoor will be seen as Sanjay Dutt
 kaha jaataa he ki unka rishta 1993 main sanjay dutt kii giraftaar ke baad khatm ho gaya
 Madhuri Dixit did not even go to jail to meet him
 sanjay dutt ke jivan par ban rahi is film main ranbir ke alaava, manisha koyrala or karishma tanna bhi najar aane vaali hai

 Pollution caused by straw has reduced this year
 It is wrong to blame farmers for pollution
 On the one hand, the Supreme Court on Monday showed a tough stance on increasing pollution in Delhi and said that there is no sympathy for the farmers who burn the straw
 vahiin kendriya krishi mantri narendra singh tomars ne kaha ki centre kii yojana kii vajah se is saal dilli ke aasapaas ke rajyon main paraali jalaana kam hua he
 The Agriculture Minister also claimed that the pollution caused by burning of straw is also reduced this year
 ek kaarykram main media se baat karte hue tomars ne kaha, pradooshan ke liye sirf kisaanon or paraali jalaae jane ko dosha dena galat he

 The Agriculture Minister said, 'the Centre's subsidy scheme brought good results

 Due to this, burning of straw is reduced this year
 ’ tomars ke mutabik chaaron rajya muddon kii pahchaan karke saajha taur par kaam karenge jisase paraali jalaane par puri tarah viraam lagaaya ja sake
 The Agriculture Minister termed it as unfortunate for pollution to remain a cause of stubble burning

 Tomar said that the Chief Minister of Punjab should first start it as a pilot project in the chosen area and see what it helps
 tomars ne kaha, ‘hamaare prayaas paraali jalaana ghataane par he
 This requires better management of the straw
 iske liye koi prakriya banani chahie, sabsidi dena hi kargar nahin rahegaa

 The Uttar Pradesh government has issued new instructions to the power department
 iske mutabik pradesh main ab bijli ke bill hindi main bhi die jaaenge taaki aam upabhokta ise samajhane main suvidha ho
 Not only this, if a bill of more than 20 thousand on two kilowatt connection will be sent to the consumer only after thorough investigation
 is maamle main urja mantri shrikant sharma ne vidhaan parishad main bill main gadabadi sambandhi mudde uthaae jane par yah aashwaasan diya
 In fact, the issue in the Legislative Council came when Parvez Ali, a member of Samajwadi Party, told the House citing a case that a bill of more than 100 crores was sent to a person in Hapur district
 bill dekhte hi uski tabiyat kharaab ho gai
 This kind of mess is happening in all the bills
 inhen thik karne ke naam par vibhaag ke log vasuuli kar rahe hai
 Bills are given in English
 jise padhe-likhe log bhi nahin samaj pate hai
 Responding to this objection, Energy Minister Shrikant Sharma said that there are 2 irregularities in the bill in the state

 3% shikaayatein samay se nistarit hui hai
 This is a record in itself
 @bjp4india@upgovt— Shrikant Sharma (@ptshrikant)july 24, 2019unhone kaha ki yah bhi nirnay liya gaya he ki do kilawatt ke conection par agar 20 hajaar se zyada kaa bill he to pehle vibhaag uski jaanch karegaa or iske baad hi bill upabhokta ko bheja jayega
 This system will be fully implemented by 31 July
 is maamle main vidhaan parishad ke sabhapati ramesh yadav ne bill ko hindi main die jane kii maang par vichaar karne ke bhi nirdesh die hai
 On this, the Energy Minister said that every effort will be made to prepare the bill in Hindi
 sirf takneekee baaten hi angreji main rahengi

 In its report filed on the Bombay Stock Exchange, the company said, "mistry has caused significant losses to the Tata group, TCSL and its shareholders and employees
 "report main kaha gaya he, "tata sans ke kaaryakari adhyaksh ke pad par se hataae jane ke baad bhi mistre ne kai jhuthe aarope lagaae, jisase na sirf tata sans or uske board nideshkon kii chhavi dhoomil hui, balki samooche tata samooh ko nuksaan pahunchaa, jiskaa tisles abhinn ang he

 isse pehle tisies ne mistre kii jagah ishat hossain ko company nideshak mandal kaa nayaa adhyaksh chunaa tha
 Tata Sons is the holding company of Tata group companies, which removed 48-year-old Mistry from the post of chairman last month and appointed Ratan Tata as interim chairman
 tata sans ne pehle jari ek bayaan main kaha tha ki apdasth adhyaksh ko samooh kii sabhi companiyon ke sabhi padon se istipha de dena chahie

 loksabhaa chunaav main kisi party ko bahumat nahin milegaa, 'modi lahar' kii baat karne vaali bijepi 180 kaa aankada paar nahin kar sakegi
 This is the estimate of the Congress party
 yah daawa kiya he ek angreji akhbaar ne
 Sources in the Congress party have said that the BJP will be able to win 170 to 180 seats
 sarkaar banane ke liye unhen 100 saansadon kii jarurat padegi
 Which means the regional parties will decide who will be the next PM of the country, not the BJP
 narendra modi kaa prabhaav bijepi shasit madhya pradesh, rajasthan, gujarat or chhattisgarh main dikhegaa
 He is an important factor in UP and Bihar
 haalanki, sarkaar banane ke liye bijepi ke ranneetikaron ko trinmul congress, ediemke, diemke, biju janata dal, wiesar congress or aap jaisi partiyon par nirbhar hona padegaa
 Let me tell you that BJP has a pre-poll alliance with Shiv Sena, Telugu Desam Party and Shiromani Akali Dal
 bijepi ke manager bispi supremeo mayawati ko bhi endie main laane kii koshish kar sakate hai
 He believes that after the election results, the attitude of regional parties will change
 party ke aankalan ke mutabik, gaiyr-congressi or gaiyr-bijepi partiyon ko 195 siten milane kii sambhaavna he
 But it is very difficult for all these parties to come together to form a government because there are differences on many issues
 congress kaa anumaan he ki vah 120 se 140 siten jeetne main kaamyaab hogi haalanki bijepi ke andruni survey ke mutabik vah 220 aankada chhu legi
 It is clear from these estimates that it is impossible for any one party to get an absolute majority in the election

 pakistan ke samvidhan ko taak par rakhkar apatkaal lagu karne ke aarope main musharraf par deshadroh kaa mukadmaa chal rahaa he
 The heat of the election has caught up in the entire country, with every seat having a multiplication of votes, thousands of candidates are trying their best to win their seats in Parliament
 chunaav main koun jeetta he or koun duusare nambar par rahata he, is baat ke alaava jo baat logon ko dilachasp lagati he vah he ki kitne pratyaashee apni jamaanat bachaa sake
 It is also a matter of pride for the candidates if they save their bail, while forfeiture of bail is often considered abusive
 chunaav ayog ke niyamon ke anusaar yadi pratyaashee matdaan ke kul vaid maton ke kam se kam chathe bhaag ke baraabar mat praapt karne main vifal rahata he to uski jamaanat kii raashi sarkari khajaane main jamaa ho jaati he, lekin pichley aam chunaavon ke aankadon ko dekhen to haal ke chunaavon main chunavi maidan main matadaataaon ne takreeban 90 fisadi ummidavaaron kii jamaanat jabt karvaa di
 In the first Lok Sabha election of 1951-52, about 40 per cent, out of 1874 candidates, 745 candidates lost their deposits
 tab se lagbhag sabhi loksabhaa chunaavon main jamaanat ke jabt hone kii sankhya badhati gai
 The number of forfeiters was the highest in the 11th Lok Sabha elections held in 1996
 us samay 13952 pratyaashiyon main se 12688 pratyaashiyon yani 91 pratishat ummidavaaron kii jamaanat jabt ho gai
 In this election, the number of candidates contesting the Lok Sabha elections was also the highest
 is sandarbh main 2009 main hua pichhlaa loksabhaa chunaav bhi pratyaashiyon ke liye adhik acha nahin rahaa
 In this too, the bail of 85 percent of the candidates was forfeited
 pratishat kii drushti se jamaanat jabt hone ke maamalon main 1996 ke chunaavon main 91 pratishat or 1991 ke chunaavon main 86 pratishat ke baad jamaanat jabt hone waalon kaa yah teesraa sabase bada chunaav tha
 In the first elections held in 1951-52, out of 1217 candidates of national parties, 344, ie 28 percent of the candidates lost their deposits
 1957 main hue agle chunaavon main sthiti main sudhaar hua
 At present, out of 919 candidates, only 130 candidates ie 14 per cent candidates lost their deposits
 1977 ke aam chunaavon main rashtriya dalon kaa nishpaadan sarvottam rahaa
 In these elections, out of 1060 candidates, only 100 candidates ie 9 percent of their deposits were forfeited
 tulanaatmak tareeke se 2009 kaa aam chunaav rashtriya partiyon ke pratyaashiyon ke liye utane achche nahin rahe, kyonki isamen lagbhag har duusare pratyaashee kii jamaanat jabt ho gai
 In 2009, out of 1623 candidates from national parties, 779 candidates lost their deposits
 rashtriya dalon ke pratyaashiyon kii sthiti 11veen loksabhaa ke chunaavon main sabase adhik kharaab rahi
 Here, out of 1817 candidates, 897 ie 49 percent of the candidates lost their deposits
 jamaanat bhale hi jabt ho, lekin jamaanat kaa jabt hona chunaav ladane main baadhak nahin rahaa he, kyonki chunaav ladane waalon kii sankhya har chunaav main amuman bad hi rahi he
 Experts consider it auspicious sign for democracy

 Central Home Secretary RK Singh said that the family of Afzal, living in Sopore in North Kashmir, was informed about the government's decision that his mercy petition has been rejected

 agenda ajtak ke duusare din congress netaa anand sharma ne apni baat rakhi
 Sharma attacked the Modi government and said that in the name of demonetisation, there is a spectacle in the country
 unhone kaha ki notebandi ke pehle kii taiyaari nahin hui
 The Prime Minister is not trying to handle the situation in any way
 keval naatak ho rahaa he
 The Congress leader alleged that people were forced to beg after demonetisation
 unhone kaha ki kalaadhan jarur khatm hona chahie
 But demonetisation in the name of fake note is wrong
 sarkaar ne pehle notebandi kaa elaan kiya, phir kaha gaya ki cashles tranjaction kiijie
 Black money will increase with the 2000 note
 desh main chote-chote kaarkaane band ho rahe hai
 Sharma alleged that the Modi government has tainted India in the world that our economy is dependent on black money
 kisaanon, mazdooron kii dihadi nakadi par chalati he
 It is not black
 yah aparaadh kaa paisa nahin he
 Not declaring your income is black money
 desh main duusare deshon ke rajdoot pareshaan ho rahe hai
 Our image is getting worse
 congress netaa ne kaha ki notebandi ke baad logon ko rahi pareshaani ke baad piem ko sadan main aana chahie tha
 PM speaks outside, does not speak in the House
 piem ko bolne se kisi ne nahin roka he
 The opposition is not running away from the discussion
 vipaksh ko kaha ja rahaa he ki aap aalochana mat kiijie
 The government has insulted Parliament
 sarkaar ne dhai saal main kiya kya he
 He said, 'had my name been the name of a minority in place of Anand Sharma, he would have been called a traitor
 prajatantr main vipaksh kii aawaaj nahin ho to santulan bighad jayega
 16 parties are united on demonetisation
 'anand sharma ne jor dekar kaha ki congress party ke bheetar loktantr he, maujuuda modi sarkaar main aisa nahin he
 PM Modi has no courage in his government to suggest him
 shaayad keval amit shah hi piem modi ko suzav de sakate hai
 a few days before voting for the first round of Chhattisgarh assembly elections, Guru Baldas of Satnami society joined the Congress with his son Khushwant Saheb
 yah bijepi ke liye jhatka mana ja rahaa he
 Significantly, just before voting in the last assembly election, Guru Baladas had formed a party named Satnam Sena and fielded candidates for the seats reserved for the ten Scheduled Castes
 mana jaataa he ki isse congress ko in siton par behad nuksaan uthaanaa padaa tha
 The BJP gained in the midst of a triangular situation
 bijepi ne das main se nau siton par jeet darj kii thi
 Satnami society is a major vote bank in the state
 kul voton main is samaaj kii kareeb 16 pratishat kii hissedari he
 This is the reason why political parties are in every possible effort to connect them with themselves
 june 2017 main guru baldas ne chhattisgarh pravaas par pahunche bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah se mulaakaat kii thi
 After this meeting, there were speculations that Baladas could enter BJP
 satnami samaaj ne is baar ke vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi ke sang khadey hone ke bajaay congress ke kheme main jane ko bade siyaasi ghatnakram ke taur par dekha ja rahaa he
 Guru Baldas of Satnami society says that BJP did not respect the people of the society, so they joined Congress party
 guru baldas kii congress main entry ke baad party chhattisgarh vidhansabha chunaav main ulatpher karte hue ahm chunaav main jeet kii ummid kar rahi he
 Interestingly, there is already a leader of Satnami society Rudra Guru in the Congress
 chhattisgarh main 2013 ke vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi ko congress se das siten zyada mili thim
 But BJP 0 in vote share
 77 fisadi hi congress se zyada thi
 In such a situation, the announcement of the support of the Satnami society in the Congress is expected to end the exile of 15 years of power
 darasal, chhattisgarh main jati kaa factor bhi ahm he
 With Mayawati joining, Jogi's Janata Congress hopes that Dalit voters will get the votes outright
 khaskar satnami samaaj kaha jisase jogi aate hai
 In such a situation, the Congress has given a big blow to the Ajit Jogi and BSP alliance by connecting Satnami society with them
 vot bank ke taur par satnami samaaj kii chhattisgarh main badi pakad he
 They have 20 to 35 percent of the vote in 14 state assembly seats
 pichley chunaav main daliton ko liye arakshit 10 vidhansabha siton main se 9 siten bijepi ne jiti thi or ek seat congress ke khate main gai thi
 With the Satnami society joining the Congress, the bjp's dream of coming to power for the fourth time may revolt
 IPL menhetric kaa recordbanane vaale amit mishra kaa aaj janm din he
 Amit Mishra, who threw a right arm leg break ball in odis, Tests and T20s for the Indian team, was born on 24 November 1982
 amit mishra ko pehali baar 2002 main team india main shaamil kiya gaya lekin tab unhen antim ekadash main nahin rakhaa gaya
 However, soon he got a chance to play in odis for Team India
 tivies cap (2003) main dakshin africa ke khilaaf unhone vanade main padaarpan kiya or vanade kariyar kaa pehla wicket bhi liya
 However, after that Mishra had to wait for five years to play a Test match and in 2008 he got an opportunity to play Mohali Test due to the injury of regular Indian bowler Anil Kumble
 mishra ne is maukey kaa bakhubi phayda uthaaya or test main harbhajan or jahir jaise gendbaajon kii maujuudagi ke baavjood pehali pari main shandaar 5 wicket or test main kul 7 wicket lekar jeet main ahm bhoomika nibhaai
 Despite this, then Team India coach Gary Kirsten said that with the return of Kumble Mishra will have to sit on the bench but then Mishra was lucky that he remained in the team even after Kumble's return because then Harbhajan got injured
 iske kuch samay ke baad kumble ne test se sanyas le liya lekin mishra team india main niyamit leg spinner nahin ban sake or team main andar baahar hote rahe kabhi pradarshan ke aadhaar par to kabhi team main ek spinner ko khilaane kii majaburi kii vajah se
 During this time, Mishra faced Turbanator Harbhajan and leg-spinner Pragyan Ojha to retain his place in the team
 srilanka ke khilaaf november 2009 main mishra ne 203 ran kharch kar keval ek wicket liye to iske agle hi match main unhone shandaar 7 wicket liye, yah match unhone bangladesh ke khilaaf khelaa
 Mishra played his last Test against England in August 2011, in which he did not get any wickets despite spending 170 and he was not selected for the Test so far
 mishra kul 13 test match khel chuke hai or unki jholii main 43
 He has 43 wickets at an average of 30
 vanade main pradarshnaudhar mishra ko vanade team main lagaataar shaamil kiya jaataa rahaa he
 After a strong performance in the IPL in 2013, Mishra was included in the ODI team and performed brilliantly on the tour of Zimbabwe
 is daure par unhone paanch maichon main 18 wicket lekar dwipaksheeya siries main sarvaadhik wicket lene kaa record banaaya
 In 2014, he took 8 wickets in five odis played
 vanade kariyar ke dauraan mishra ne ab tak khele gaye 27 maichon main 23
 Has taken 45 wickets at an average of 96
 IPL main hetric or shunya kaa recordtest or vanade main amit mishra ko team india kaa aniyamit player kahen to atishyokti nahin hogi lekin mishra indian premier lig main lagaataar khelte rahe hai or acha pradarshan bhi karte rahe hai
 Amit Mishra has played in all seven editions of the IPL and is named second in the ipl's highest wicket takers
 mishra ne khele gaye kul 86 maichon main 102 wicket liye hai jo is list main sirf lasith malinga (119) se peeche hai
 Not only this, there is also a record of taking hat-trick in IPL three times
 pehali baar 2008 main dilli dairedevills ke liye or duusari baar 2011 main unhone deccan chargers kii ore se khelte hue hetric lagaai
 He then scored a hat-trick in 2013, playing for Sunrisers Hyderabad in IPL-6
 haalanki IPL main unke naam sarvaadhik shunya par out hone kaa bhi record he
 They have been out 10 times without opening an account
 vaise wo is record ko gautam gambhir ke saath saajha karte hai
 There has been a political earthquake on the CBI incident
 desh kii sabase badi jaanch agency ke donon varisht adhikari ek-duusare par gambhir iljaam laga rahe hai, jiske baad yah sawaal bhi khadaa ho gaya he ki sahi or galat kaa pataa koun lagayegaa
 Although the situation has now been clarified by the Central Government on this question, but the Government has distanced itself from the investigation of this entire matter
 1
 CBI had registered an FIR against Special Director Rakesh Asthan, in which he is charged with taking bribe
 asthana ke khilaaf sibiai team ne jaanch shuru kar giraftaar bhi kii
 But Asthana retaliated and wrote a letter to the government against CBI Director Alok Verma
 maamle ne tool pakadaa to 23 oktober ko alok verma or rakesh asthana donon ko chuttee par bhejne kaa aadesh jari ho gaya
 Please tell that no case has been registered against Alok Verma, Asthana has written only a complaint letter against him, while an FIR has been registered against Asthana
 2
 On Wednesday, Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley told in a press conference on this issue that both the big CBI officials have accused each other
 isliye nishpaksh jaanch ke maddenjar donon adhikariyon ko sibiai se alag kar diya gaya he
 He cited the recommendation of the CVC behind this action
 jetali ne bataaya ki mangalvaar ko sivisi ne apni meeting main kanoon ke tahat ye sifarish kii thi ki ye donon adhikari aaropon kii jaanch nahin kar sakate ou na hi inke netritv main koi agency aaropon kii jaanch kar sakati he
 That is, the CVC recommendations have been told by the government behind sending Alok Verma and Rakesh Asthana on leave
 3
 Jaitley said that we are not taking any of the officers as guilty and they will take back their duties if their role in the investigation is not questioned
 4
 Arun Jaitley also made it clear in his statement that the Central Government cannot investigate the allegations of corruption against the CBI officers as it is not under the jurisdiction of the government
 jetali ne sibiai act kaa hawala dete hue bataaya ki agency se jude bhrashtachar ke aaropon kii jaanch kendriya satarkta ayog (CVC) hi kar saktaa he
 That is, the government has made it clear that to find out who is right and who is wrong in Asthana or Alok Verma, the CVC will constitute the SIT, the government will have no role in it
 5
 Arun Jaitley said that in the case the central government can keep an eye on its jurisdiction, it has nothing to do with the investigation
 6
 On the allegation of Congress President Rahul Gandhi, who described Rakesh Asthana as 'favorite' of PM Narendra Modi, Jaitley said that only the evidence in the investigation matters, not red or blue eye
 bijepi sarkaar ke teen saal puure karne ke baad ek baar phir piem modi duniya ke sabase shaktishaalee desh amarika chale hai
 This is the Prime Minister's fifth US visit, but he will meet the current President of America, Donald Trump
 zaahir he modi ke paas obama ke jane ke baad bharat america ke rishton main ai susti ko chust durust karne kaa bada mauka he
 If sources are to be believed, terrorism may cross the border of India and India's commendable role in Afghanistan can be mentioned in the joint statement
 26 taarikh ko duniya ke sabase puraane loktantr or sabase bade loktantr ke mukhiya aamane saamne honge
 PM Modi has spoken to US President Donald Trump three times before, but for the first time both leaders are meeting
 donon netaaon ke bebaak or milansaar andaaz ko dekhte hue rishton ke garmaahat aa sakati he
 In such a situation, this meeting is very important from a diplomatic point of view
 piem modi ke daure se thik pehle america pratinidhi sabha ke do sadasyon ne pakistan kaa gaiyr nato saajhedaar kaa darja khatm karne kaa vidheyak pesh kiya he
 Obviously, this will increase the difficulties of Pakistan and this is good news for India
 trump prashasan ne bhi pakistan main punap rahe hakkaani network or anya aatanki sanghathanon par rukh kadaa kiya he
 In such a situation, negotiations between Trump and Modi can strengthen India's fight against terrorism
 mumkin he ki kisi nae sanghathan yaa aatank ke aakaa par bain par sahmati bane
 According to the sources, terrorism originating from across the border and active role in Afghanistan of India can also be mentioned in the joint statement
 donon deshon ke bich samarik or aarthik patal par kuch nae kadam badhaane kii ghoshnaa ho sakati he
 Both have been exchanging each other in this area
 e-1bi visa ko lekar trump ke nae aadesh ko lekar bhi bharat kii chintaaen badi hui hai
 Significantly, an order has been issued to analyze the H1B visa rules under Trump's US First Policy
 modi trump se is vishay main bharat kii chintaa zaahir kar sakate hai
 At the same time, Modi is still silent about the ever increasing attacks on Indians since Trump's arrival
 haalanki is daure par paris samjhaute kaa bhi saaya mandara rahaa he
 Trump had held China and India responsible for the US walkout
 chunauti piem modi ke saamne pichley teen saal kii mitrataa ko ko or majboot karne kii he
 The Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, Yogi Adityanath, made several announcements for the state poor, with a big announcement that from this session the government will provide dress, sweaters, shoes, socks and books for all government school children
 skulon main tamaam chijen to bant gayi lekin thand shuru hone ke baad bhi bacchon ko sweater nahin mili hai
 Yogi did the promise, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had issued a decree that in addition to dress, sweaters and shoes and socks will be given to the students of all primary schools in the state
 lekin aadha disambar bitne ke baad bhi sarkari skulon main naunihaalon ko sweater nahin baante gaye hai
 Late latency of the system is overshadowing the chilling children
 aisa lagata he ki yogi adityanath kaa yahfarmaan kaagajon taksimat kar rah gaya, haalanki mantri kaa daawa he ki disambar main sweater baant die jaaenge
 The time of government schools in Dhoom children's classup is from 9 am to 3 pm and the classes of children without a sweater are to be sunlight
 banda ke skool kii padtaal karne par pataa chalaa ki yahaan bhi sarkari skool ke bachche sardi main bina sweater ke padhai kar rahe hai
 The basic education officer here told that work has started from district level and sweaters will be distributed soon here too
 yahaan se parches portal par login kii karrwai ho gayi he, thand se bachaane ke liye dhoop main class lag rahi hai, jald sweater bhi aa jaaenge
 The delay in the tender due to elections is also similar to Banda's state school of Jhansi in Bundelkhand
 yahaan ke bacchon ko padhaane vaale pradhanacharya or adhyapakon kaa kahana he bachche garib hai itnaa maa-baap nahin kama pate
 This is the reason that the children of the government were coddles and schoolmates
 iske saath hi abhi sardi main sweater or juute-mojey dene kaa bhi yogi shashan ne vaada kiya he
 Two months have passed since the winter season, but so far neither sweaters nor shoes have been given to the children
 jis kaaran bachche is thithran bhari sardi main bina sweater hi padhane ko majaboor hai, haalanki jin bacchon ke paas sweater he vah pahanakar skool aate hai
 The principal of the primary school in Jhansi says that the sweaters have not come due to the election
 abhi tender bhi nahin hue he lagata he is maah ke aakhir tak aa jaayen
 School children forced to chill, Deoria of eastern Uttar Pradesh has the same condition
 yahaan bhi kuch aisi hi tasviren dekhne ko mili jo kampa dene vaali thim
 In Deoria district, when we turned to the government primary schools, the pictures were shocking
 skulon main sweater nahin milane se garib chaatr thand main pard rahe the
 His feet did not have shoes
 in bacchon kaa kahana he ki hamen sweater nahin mila or thand kaaphi he
 We are coming to school without a sweater
 devaria main skool ke sahaayak adhyaaapak ne bataaya kii jaankaree to mili thi ki sweater or juute-mojey bacchon ko uplabdh karaane hai lekin abhi tak tender hi nahin hua he
 In Lucknow, the Basic Education Minister said that in December, children will get sweaters and socks
 baharhaal aadhi sardi to nikal gai ab dekhnaa he ki janvari main bachche sweater pahan pate hai ki nahin
 The image of the police in the minds of the people remains quite bad
 agar unhen kabhi aisi jarurat pad jaae ki unhen police stesan jane kii jarurat ho to log kai baar sochate hai
 Many times people do not even compile the police thinking that they do not know how the police will treat them, but recently a case has come out of Mumbai which can change the thinking of the police
 mumbai police puri tarah is koshish main lagi he ki logon kaa najariya unke prati badale or wo twitor par kaaphi charchaa main bhi rahati he
 Actually, Anishsakinaka police station Mumbai resident went to register FIR
 is samay main jab soshal media par police ke bare main kai tarah kii baaten kii jaati hai ki wo logon ke saath kharaab bartaav karti he or exiaar darj karne main anakani karti he in sabake bich mumbai police ne naa keval anish kii exiaar darj kii balki jab unhen pataa chalaa ki shanivaar ko (14 oktober) unka janmdin he to unhone anish ke liye kek bhi mangavaya
 When personal details in the FIR revealed it's complainant Anish's birthday, a cake followed the FIR Copy at Sakinaka Pstn 😊pic
 twitter
 com / tebnnydj3y — Mumbai Police (@mumbaipolice) October 14, 2017 Mumbai police shared this information on their Twitter handle
 unhone anish ke saath tasviir share karte hue likhaa ki jab personal ditels se yah pataa chalaa ki aaj anish kaa janmdin he to sakinaka police stesan main unke liye kek mangavaya gaya
 After seeing this face of the police, we can expect that those who are sitting wrong thinking about the police will have a change in their thinking and they will not shy away from going to the police station next time the need arises

 html bijepi ne ek baar phir sonia gandhi par hallaa bol diya he
 The outrage is over why the cabinet decided to set up a women's university in Sonia's Lok Sabha constituency Rae Bareli
 bijepi netaa ravishankar prasad ne chutki lete hue kaha ki sonia ko khush karne ke liye cabinet ne ye faisla to le liya lekin sarkaar ko ye yaad rakhana hoga ki raibareli ke baahar bhi aam aadmi rahata he
 Ravi Shankar Prasad said that if the Congress had taken care of the entire country, then their condition would not have been diluted today
 bijepi ko lagane laga he ki ab badlaav kii aandhi main congress bah jaaegi
 However, the bjp's displeasure is over the ordinance issued on the food security bill
 ravishankar prasad ne kaha ki jab mulaayam singh yadav jaise sarkaar ke sahyogi bill ko sansad main paarit karne kii maang kar rahe hai to sarkaar ne jaldbaaji kyon machaai
 The BJP feared that the ordinance was meant to show that Sonia Gandhi was behind it
 agar sansad main ise paas kiya jaataa to ye puure sansad kii jaagir hoti, yani monsoon satr ke ek baar phir hangaame kii bhent chadhane ke asaar hai kyonki sabhi dalon par chunavi rang chadhane laga he

 bharat or srilanka ke bich 12 agast se shuru ho rahi test siries main muqabla do captainon ke bich bhi hoga
 On the one hand there will be high-profile Virat Kohli, known for his aggressive temper, on the other hand, Angelo Mathews, the cool low-profile star of traditional cricket
 donon ek-duusare ko cricket ke maidan par joardaar takkar dene ke liye taiyaar hai
 This series is a new beginning for Team India captain Virat Kohli
 vah bataur captain pehali baar kisi badi siries main team kii captaini karenge, lekin unka iraadaa saaf he, ve har haal main srilanka main test jeetna chaahate hai
 There is a reason for this
 kohli bharat ke liye ab tak 3 test maichon main captaini kar chuke hai, lekin team koi bhi match nahin jeet pai he
 However, Kohli's personal performance as a captain is superb
 unhone captaini vaale 3 test maichon main 463 ran banaae hai
 Kohli has scored 3 centuries during this period and his batting average is more than 92
 unke kariyar ausat 45 ke dogune se bhi zyada
 That is, Kohli is a captain capable of carrying the burden of responsibility, but from the same perspective, Angelo Mathews also proves to be an amazing captain
 captain banane ke baad maithyuj kaa vyaktigat pradarshan bhi kaaphi shandaar hota gaya
 Matthews has scored 1794 runs in 18 Tests as captain
 is dauraan unki ballebaaji kaa ausat 71 se zyada kaa he, jo unke kariyar ausat 51 se zyada he
 He has scored 4 centuries in his 5 centuries after becoming captain
 viraat kohli kii ek badi khaasiyat yah bhi he ki vah team ke khilaadiyon ke saath kaaphi ghul-mil jate hai or aakraamak tevar se puri team ko jeet ke liye prerit kar sakate hai
 Angelo Matthews has an undermined edge in this aspect
 tippaniyan Being cool, he seems to lack aggression, but the advantage is that he listens to all teammates
 itnaa hi nahin vah ek behtareen olerounder hai
 Apart from batting, as a fast bowler, he can also increase the difficulties of Team India
 aise main agressive or kool captainon kii yah takkar dekhne laayak hogi

 More than double his career average of 45
 yani kohli jimmedaari kaa boj khud uthaane main sakasham captain hai, lekin isi nazariye se dekhen to angelo maithyuj bhi kamaal ke captain sabit hote hai
 After becoming captain, Matthews' personal performance also grew significantly

 Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) national president Amit Shah today accused Uttar Pradesh's Narendra Modi government of trying to take advantage of the chaos in the Samajwadi Party in the upcoming assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh
 The money being given will eat uncle and nephew
 saath hi daawa kiya ki purv main kalyaan singh ke netritv main bhaajapa sarkaar ke samay gunde yaa to salaakhon ke peeche the yaa phir bhumigat ho gayi the
 Shah, while holding a 'sankalp' rally in the sp's stronghold Etawah, said, 'modi government has decided to give one lakh crore more rupees to Uttar Pradesh every year but nothing will come to your (public) share
 chachaa (sapa ke pradesh adhyaksh shivpal singh yadav) khaaenge, bhatija (mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav) khayega or kuch bachaa to ajam khan (pradesh ke cabinet mantri) chatakar jaaenge
 He lashed out at Shivpal, Akhilesh and Mayawati, saying that in the past when Kalyan Singh was in power in Uttar Pradesh, the law and order situation was that the goons were either behind bars or went underground
 shah kaa nishaanaa basapa supremeo mayawati kii ore tha, jo daawa karti hai ki jab rajya main unki sarkaar thi, tab kanoon vyavastha kii sthiti durust rahi
 He said, 'sister ji (mayawati) is saying that we will fix law and order
 bahan ji, aapke samay main hi balaatkaar kii ghatnaon main 161 pratishat kii vruddhi hui thi
 In your time itself, 1100 Dalits were killed
 ’sapa sarkaar par kanoon vyavastha ko majaak banane kaa aarope madhte hue bhaajapa adhyaksh ne kaha, ‘kanoon vyavastha ko na bhatija (akhilesh) thik kar saktaa he or na hi buaa :mayawati: thik kar sakati hai
 ' uttar pradesh ke aagaamee vidhansabha chunaavon main bhaajapa ko do tihaai bahumat milane kaa daawa karte hue shah ne kaha ki ab sapa or basapa kii ‘gundai’ nahin chalegi kyonki bhaajapa main gundon kii koi jagah nahin he or uttar pradesh vikaas ke raste par badhane vaala he
 Shah said, 'BJP government is going to form in Uttar Pradesh with two-third majority
 sapa sarkaar ne pradesh main kanoon vyavastha kaa majaak banaakar rakh diya he
 ' unhone yuvaaon kaa aahvaan karte hue kaha, ‘apni takat itani prachand kar do ki gunde ghar se baahar hi naa nikalen
 BJP workers came out with a pledge that SP and bsp's hooliganism will not work
 bahut hua
 Now Uttar Pradesh is on the path of development
 ’ shah ne kaha, ‘bhaajapa main gundon kii koi jagah nahin he
 It is a party of patriots
 ’ unhone kaha ki pradesh kii sapa sarkaar ne kanoon vyavastha kii angreji ‘lau and order’ kar di or phir uski hindi ‘lo’ and ‘order’ kar di
 This government changed the meaning of law and order
 unhone kaha, ‘agar sarkaar kaa samarthan naa hota to kya ramavriksh yadav kii jameen kabja karne kii himmat hoti
 sp's goons have seized the land of the poor in the village
 main aapako bharosa dilaataa hum ki bhaajapa kaa mukhyamantri shapath lete hi choubees ghante main ye log apane aap kabja chhodkar uttar pradesh bhi chhod denge
 ' shah ne itawa ko veeron kii bhoomi bataate hue shahid nitin yadav ko yaad kiya or kaha ki itawa ke is jawan ke balidaan ko puraa desh naman karata he
 He praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi while referring to the targeted attack
 congress sarkaar ke samay shahid kaa sir katkar le jane kii ghatana kaa ullekh karte hue shah ne kaha ki ek jamaana tha, jab kendra main congress, sapa or basapa kii mili juli sarkaar thi or aaye din sarhad par hamale hote the
 Today there is a BJP government at the center, so the enemy is given a befitting reply as soon as the border is attacked
 unhone kaha ki aaj puri duniya main bhartiya senaaon kii bahaduree ke charche hai
 Crisscrossing India's borders will not be tolerated
 shah ne modi sarkaar kii uplabdhiyaan ginate hue kaha ki dhai saal ho gaya, modi sarkaar par hamaare virdohi bhi bhrashtachar kaa aarope nahin laga paye
 Not a single scandal, not a single scam is on the Modi government
 upie sarkaar ne 12 lakh karod rupee kaa ghotaalaa kiya tha
 He also accused the SP and BSP of being involved in the scam, with whose support the UPA government of Congress was running
 unhone kaha, ‘main sapa, basapa or congress ke netaaon ko poochna chahta hum ki 2017 main uttar pradesh kii janata se vot maangane kii himmat kis munh se kar rahe ho
 Will the people of Uttar Pradesh again vote for corruption
 
 
 is baar lakhanu main aisi sarkaar (bhaajapa sarkaar) hogi ki paanch saal main ek bhi ghotaalaa, bhrashtachar nahin hoga
 Shah said that if change is to be brought and development is to be done, then the BJP will have to form an absolute majority government in the state
 ham pai pai kaa hisaab pradesh kii janata ko denge
 The comments congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi par prahaar karte hue bhaajapa adhyaksh ne kaha ki beete dinon pradesh main apni yatra ke dauraan ‘rahul baba’ ne kaha tha ki rajya main aalu kii factory lagaayenge

 'aapkaa banty' un bejod upanyaason main he jinke bina na to beesvin shatabdi ke hindi upanyaas kii baat kii sakati he, na hi stri-vimarsh ko sahi dharaatal par samajha ja saktaa he
 The novel, written in the year 1970, is still as popular today despite dozens of editions and translations as it was when it was first published as a serial in Dharmayuga
 'aapkaa banty' ek kaaljayi upanyaas he
 It is seen as a valuable achievement of Hindi literature
 is upanyaas kii khaasiyat yah he ki yah ek bachche kii nigahon se ghayal hoti samvednaa kaa behad maarmik chithran karata he, jisamen madhyamvargeey parivaar main sambandh viched kii sthiti ek bachche kii duniya kaa bhayaavah duswapn ban jaati he
 Everyone is so entangled in each other that the conditions arising out of family tragedy become torture for all
 kahana mushkil he ki yah kahani balak banty kii he yaa maan shakun kii
 The truth of Shakun's life is that the legitimate ambition and self-reliance of the woman is a challenge for the man - in the result, the couple leaves her alienated from stress
 yah shakun kaa nahin, samaaj main nirantar apni jagah banaati, failaati or apana kad badhaati 'nai stri' kaa satya he
 In this duel between husband and wife, the same is most commonly brewed here, which is absolutely innocent, innocent and insecure - and that is Bunty
 bachche kii chetana main bado ke is sansar ko kathakaar mannu bhandari ne pehali baar pahachaanaa tha
 Every page in this novel, acclaimed for its deep understanding of child psychology, is touching and evocative
 sahitya ajtak ke pathakon ke liye 'aapkaa banty' kaa ek anshah xxrep 4 * shakun ke liye samay jaise ek lambey arase se thahar gaya tha
 Like this, the needle of the clock used to move
 rose savere peeche se aangan se ghuskar dhoop saare ghar ko chamkaati- damkati dopaher ko lon main fail-pasarkar baith jaati or shaam ko badi alsaayi-si dhire-dhire sarakati hui peeche kii pahadiyon main chhip jaati
 The seasons kept on pushing each other
 phir bhi shakun ko lagata tha ki samay jaise thaharkar jam gaya he or jame hue samay kii yah chattan na kahin se pighalati thi, na tuutati thi
 The bus has been breaking down, so slowly - slowly, sesame
 yon to pichley do-teen saalon se hi tehraav kaa yah ehsaas baraabar hi hota rahaa he, par idhar ek saal se to yah ehsaas tikhaa hote-hote jaise asay-sa ho gaya tha
 Long holidays standing in front and extremely long lazy and gloomy days of summer! What colleges will be closed like a good excuse to pass the time will be over
 varanaa uske nitant ghatnahin jivan main maatr college janaa bhi ek ghatana kii hi ahmiyat rakhata he
 Under the guise of college, and many problems associated with the college, she at least gets the satisfaction of being busy with someone
 varanaa uski apni zindagi main kuch bhi to aisa nahin he, jo kshan-bhar ko bhi uttejnaa paidaa kar sake
 If Bunty is standing on his head, she keeps feeling a little excited about him
 yadi usne thik se khaanaa nahin khaaya yaa ki vah kisi baat par zid karke ro diya yaa ki usne koi aisi baat puch lee, jo is umr ke bachche ko nahin poochni chahie to vah uttejit hone kii sthiti tak pareshaan ho jaaya karti he
 However inside, she also knows somewhere that none of these things make her tired by stimulating her in the true sense, but she tries to get excited in the true sense
 keval thak hi nahin jaati, ek prakaar se tut jaati he
 But yesterday the lawyer uncle proposed to him and today for which he is coming again, he shook him completely from inside
 haalaanki vah samaj nahin paa rahi he ki aakhir kal kii baat main aisa nayaa kya tha, jise lekar vah itani pareshaan yaa vichlit ho rahi he
 It is a repetition of a very old, expired story! Again ? Still there is something that she is not able to take the whole thing very smoothly
 lag rahaa he jaise use puri tarah math diya gaya he
 Whenever the lawyer uncle comes, she is completely churned
 baahar se to tab bhi kuch ghatit nahin hota, ek patta tak nahin hilta, par man ke bheetar hi bheetar use jane kitne aandhi-toofaanon ko jhelana padataa he
 He has suffered
 ajay ke kisi ke saath sambandh badhane kii soochna or phir uske saath saital ho jane kii soochna ne use kitna tilamila diya tha
 Despite being alone, the feeling of loneliness was awakened once again, very sharp and bitter
 apmaan kii bhaavana ne us dansh ko bahut zyaada badha diya tha
 And someone was above one year, the uncle had come and said, "what to tell, i don't understand anything
" banty ko lekar uske man main ek kachot he or yahi kachot kabhi-kabhi
 
 
 So she was filled with cruel satisfaction from top to bottom
 na chaahate hue bhi aashaa kii ek halaki-si kiran man main kaundhi thi
 Who knows? 
 
 chachaa ne banty ke liye khilone die to jane kyon laga tha ki ye maatr banty ke liye hi nahin hai
 Something has been sent to Bunty by making it a medium
 uske baad ajay swayan aayaa tha
 As usual he stayed apart, remained isolated and only called Bunty
 usase to mulaakaat tak nahin kii, phir bhi shakun ko lagata rahaa tha ki na milakar bhi ajay jaise kahin phir se usase jud gaya he
 On returning from Ajay that day, she continued to call Bunty for a long time, as if Bunty had not returned from there alone, had brought Ajay with him
 par dhire-dhire vah kachot bhi shaayad samaapt ho gai, kam se kam yah to spasht ho gaya ki use lekar kuch bhi aashaa karnaa ekadam vyarth he
 And since then, it seems that everything is finished, finally and decisively
 or tab se samay uske liye jam gaya tha, shila kii tarah
 The uncle said before starting the talk yesterday, "there is no hope now
" ’’ to use yahi laga tha ki ummid to use na ab he, na pehle kabhi thi
 Then what to expect? He never had any desire to be together again
 usne kai baar apane or ajay ke sambandhon ke reshe-reshe udhede hai- sari sthiti main bahut lipt hokar bhi or sari sthiti se bahut tatasth hokar bhi, par nishkarsh hameshaa ek hi niklaa he ki donon ne ek-duusare ko kabhi pyaar kiya hi nahin
 In the early days, the feeling of taking a wrong decision had emerged very clearly in the mind of both, which every day and every event had only climbed
 samjhaute kaa praytn bhi donon main ek anderstanding paidaa karne kii ichha se nahin hota tha, varan ek-duusare ko parajeet karke apane anukool bana lene kii aakanksha se
 The days went by in arguments and debates and the nights in the hope of seeing the other lying unhappy, restless and fluttering like cold corpses
 bheetar hi bheetar chalanevaali ek ajeeb hi ladaai thi vah bhi, jisamen dam sadhakar donon ne har din pratiksha kii thi ki kab samnevaale kii saans ukhd jaati he or vah ghutane tech detaa he, jisase ki phir vah badi udaartaa or kshamashiltaa ke saath uske saare gunaah maaf karke use sweekaar kar le, uske sampurna vyaktitv ko nire ek shunya main badalakar
 And to bring about this situation, all kinds of bets and punches were played - sometimes with softness, sometimes with harshness
 kabhi sabakuch lutaa denevaali udaartaa ke, to kabhi sabakuch samet lenevaali kripanata ke
 There were also dramas of love and the acting of various moments which immersed the body and mind
 pataa nahin, un kshanon main kabhi bhavukta, aavesh yaa uttejnaa rahi bhi ho, par shaayad un donon ke hi dayaalu manon ne kabhi unhen us rup main grahan hi nahin kiya
 Both were forced to consider each other's every thing, every behavior and every act as a new bet and this compulsion increased the distance between the two so much that even then Bunty did not become a bridge to bridge that gap
 Could not, saath rahane kii yantranaa bhi badi vikat thi or algaav kaa traas bhi
 That cold war did not continue for a while, but inadvertently, his chances of victory had got a new strength that by remaining isolated it would probably feel right to lose what has been lost by losing the front
 or vakil chachaa kii har khabar, har baat in sambhaavnaaon ko banaati-bigaadti rahi thi
 To defeat the frontman, as he had to live a life of peace and contention, he defeated it himself
 samnevaala vyakti to pataa nahin kab paridrishy se hat bhi gaya or vah aaj tak usee mudra main, usee sthiti main khadi he- saans roke, dam saadhe, ghuti-ghuti or kritrim !saat varshon main vibhaagadhyaksh se principal ho jane ke peeche bhi kahin apane ko badhaane se zyaada ajay ko giraane kii aakanksha hi thi
 She herself has never been her goal
 ek adrishy anjaan-si chunauti thi, jise usne har samay apane saamne hawa main latakta hua mahasoos kiya tha or jaise uskaa muqabla karte-karte, usase jujhate-jujhate hi vah aage badhati chali gai thi
 But even then, when the front was not broken, all his progress had become as fruitless as his own
 kal pehali baar man main aayaa ki yadi vah apni drushti ajay kii jagah apane hi upar rakhti to shaayad itani maansik yatnaa to nahin bhogati
 Then every step of his, every achievement of him would make him feel something
 par ab nahin ab or nahin
 The paper signed in the middle of the table is flabbed under a glass
 mez ke is ore shakun baithi he or duusari ore vakil chachaa
 After how many days she had seen Ajay's signature and there was a strange feeling, but she could not name him even after wishing
 ek adhyay tha, jise samaapt hona tha or vah ho gaya
 This married life of ten years was no different from the feeling of walking in a dark tunnel
 aaj jaise ekaek vah uske antim chor par aa gai he
 But there is not even the satisfaction of reaching, but the compulsion to be pushed is too much
 par kaisaa he yah chor ? na prakaash, na vah khulaapan
 Do not feel liberation
 lagata he jaise is surang ne use ek duusari surang ke muhane par chhod diya he- phir ek or yatra- vaisaa hi andhkaar, vaisaa hi akelaapan
 Knowing how many questions are floating in his own mind
 kya khud use ajay kaa sambandh baari nahin padane laga tha ? kya vah khud bhi usase mukt hona nahin chaahati thi ? to phir ? kaisaa he yah dansh ? kya vah aaj tak ajay se kuch apeksha rakhti ai he ?nahin, ajay se kuch na paa sakane kaa dansh yah nahin he, balki dansh shaayad is baat kaa he ki kisi or ne ajay se vah sab kuch kyon paaya, jo uskaa prapya tha
 Or was it that he would break everything and Ajay would be sad for him, he would spar
 saath nahin rah sakate the, isliye saath nahin rah rahe hai, sthiti tab bhi waisi hi rahati, par phir bhi kitna kuch badal gaya hota ! yadi ajay ke saath mira na hoti balki uske apane saath koi hota 
 
 
 Truth be told, it is not a sting of not being able to stay with Ajay, but it is a prick to not beat Ajay, who keeps on getting him up and down

 apni sufi gayaki or qawwali ke jariye duniya bhar main mohabbat or aman kaa paigaam dene vaale sabari bros ke chashmo-chiraag amjad farid sabari khud aatank kaa shikaar ho gaye
 He was shot dead on a public road near his home in Karachi
 vaardaat ke baad taliban ke ek gut ne amjad sabari ke katl kii jimmedaari lee he
 The Taliban say that Amjad Sabri was condemning God through his aunt and killed him
 pakistan ke sabase bade shahar kaa sabase bada janajimajad sabarike janaaje main maano puraa karachi umad padaa
 The city has rarely seen such a plan before
 or ho bhi kyon nahin
 When Amjad Farid Sabri settled in Liaquatabad, the whole of Karachi was settled in Liaquatabad after him
 nam aakhon se aakhri vidaayeepuri duniya main qawwali ko uski pahchaan dilaane vaale mashhoor kavvaal gulam farid sabari ke bete amjad farid sabari ko guuruuvaar ko karachi ke paposh nagar kabristaan main dafna diya gaya
 The city bid him a last farewell with moist eyes
 ek ke baad ek paanch goliyaan daagin45 saal ke amjad sabari iftaar ke dauraan ek tivi sho ke liye karachi ke privet tivi channel ke daftar ja rahe the
 He was driving a Honda City car himself
 jabaki baraabar main unka kajan baitha tha
 Traffic was high near Liaquatabad-10 and the vehicles were almost crawling
 thik usee vakt peeche se ek motorcycle aakar car ke baraabar main rukati he
 The person sitting behind comes down and takes out the pistol from the waist and Amjad shoots five bullets one after the other, targeting Sabri
 do goliyaan amaj sabari ke sir main lageen jabaki ek kaan ke kareeb
 The remaining two bullets hit his cousin sitting equal to Amjad Sabri
 goli maarane ke baad hamalavar puure itmeenaan se motorcycle par baith kar faraar ho gaya
 Amjad Sabri and his cousin were later taken to a nearby hospital
 magar vahaan pahunchane se pehle hi amjad sabari kii maut ho chuki thi
 The Taliban said - condemned Khuda so Maraamzad Sabri's death broke out of the Taliban, about three hours after the Hakimullah Mehsud faction issued a statement and claimed responsibility for the murder
 sanghathan ke pravaktaa kaari safulla mahsood kaa kahana tha ki ne amjad sabari ko isliye maaraa gaya kyonki vah khuda kii ninda kar rahaa tha
 What was the matter actually? In 2014, Amjad Sabri sang qawwali in a program for two private TV channels in Pakistan
 is qawwali ke dauraan ek nakli shaadi ko dharmik hastiyon ke saath mila kar dikhaaya gaya tha
 There was a lot of ruckus on this as well
 pakistani kanoon ke tahat kuch logon ne isapar amjad sabari ke khilaaf ish ninda ke tahat maamla darj karne kii maang kii thi
 Later in 2014, the Islamabad High Court had issued notices to both private TV channels in this matter of blasphemy
 haalanki baad main yah maamla khatm ho gaya
 If the Taliban were targeted by the Sabarimagar Karachi police, then the Taliban targeted Amjad Sabri on this issue
 sabari gharaane ke mutabik amjad sabari ko is silsile main lagaataar dhamkiyaan mil rahi thim or unhone police suraksha kii bhi maang kii thi
 But before Amjad Sabri got police protection, we shot him on the middle road in Karachi
 philhal karachi police sisitivi camere main kaid is hamalwaar ko joroshor se talash rahi he
