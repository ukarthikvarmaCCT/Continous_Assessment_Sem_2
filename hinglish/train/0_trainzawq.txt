 a retired Chief Justice of India is known for his impeccable clothes
 haal ke ek saamaajik kaarykram main ve bhadkile safed art silk jacket main pahunche the
 When i went to meet him after dinner, i noticed that his jacket had a crown of curry on it
 maine kaha, sar, daag lag gaya
 He looked directly into my eyes and brought a sparkle to his eyes and said, "sometimes it seems, but it sticks less
" jaahir he, ham donon yah samaj rahe the ki ham unke jacket kii baat nahin kar rahe
 2018 has been dreadful for the Supreme Court so far
 is saal kii shuruyaat ek press conference ke saath hui, jise un chaar jajon ne sambodhit kiya jo mukhya nyaayadhish ke saath us collegium kaa hissaa hai jo abhi nyaayik niyuktiyaan or tabadale karata he
 The judges, along with several other allegations, alleged that everything is not going well in the functioning of the courts and sensitive cases are being given to certain benches according to convenience, on which decisions are being made on the basis of their prior relationship
 is asantosh ke samaadhaan ke liye mukhya nyaayadhish se maang kii gai thi ki jajon ke liye vishay ke aadhaar par roster banane kii vyavastha ho, taaki yah sunishchit ho sake ki cese kii vishaywastu ke aadhaar par maamle soochibaddh hon, na ki kisi manamaane siddhant ke aadhaar par
 But it was also decided through another order that the Chief Justice is the head of the roster and he can hand over a case to a particular judge if he wants
 supreme court main aadhaar or ayodhya jaise mahatvapurn maamalon kii sunwaayee chal rahi thi, is bich 60 saansadon ne mahabhiyog laane or unhen hataane kaa prastaav laakar mukhya nyaayadhish ke pad ko chunauti di
 The proposal was rejected by the vice-president of India without further investigation
 prastaav ko khaarij karne ke liye supreme court main saansad pratap es
 Bajwa and Ami H
 yagnik ne ek yachika daayar kar chunauti di
 It raised a question: what should be the appropriate bench to hear such a petition, especially given that the Chief Justice and other judges of the collegium may not be considered fit for it? The general practice in the Supreme Court is that All the petitions come up for hearing before a bench of two or three judges, who refer it to a wider constitutional bench of five judges
 lekin koi yachika tabhi aage badhaai jaati he jab ek khuli adaalat main sunwaayee ke jariye ve yah tay kar lete hai ki maamle main sanvaidhanik kanoon ke ek thos sawaal par nirnay kiya janaa he
 However, the pleas of Bajwa and Yagnik were sent directly to the constitutional bench of the five most senior judges outside the collegium
 is maamle kii taatkaalik soochibaddhta or bench ke bare main vivaran 8 may, 2018 ko sunwaayee ke din kii pichhali raat main hi pataa chal paaya, jab supreme court kii website par coj list (yani agle din ke kaamkaaj kii fehrist) ko aplod kiya gaya
 Counsel Kapil Sibal, appearing for Bajwa, asked how the matter came directly before the Constitutional Bench and if the bench is constituted under an administrative order, they would like to see this administrative order
 unke tark kaa aadhaar yah tha ki mukhya nyaayadhish aise kisi maamle main prashasnic aadesh nahin de sakate, jisamen ve khud shaamil hon
 But the bench refused to give a copy of the administrative order, after which Sibal decided that he would withdraw the petition challenging the order dismissing the impeachment motion
 haalanki yah bada sawaal ab bhi bana hua he: kya kisi jaj ke khilaaf mahabhiyog prastaav kii prakriya shuru karne kii maang ko khaarij karke vidhayika kaa koi peethasin adhikari us prastaav kii bhrunahatya kar saktaa he?maujuuda kanoonee sthiti to yah he ki mukhya nyaayadhish ke khilaaf mahabhiyog prastaav ko aage na badhaane ke up-raashtrapati ke nirnay ko sanvaidhanik adaalaton main koi chunauti nahin mili he
 Chief Justice Deepak Mishra is scheduled to retire in October this year, three of the other four judges of the collegium will also retire later this year
 to baaki saal ke liye bhartiya loktantr ke shubhechhu yah ummid kar sakate hai ki adaalat kii pratishtha par ab koi nayaa daag nahin lagegaa or puraane daag isse chipke nahin rahenge

 adaalat ne shuruaati sunwaayee ke baad 11 main se 8 maamalon ko aage kii sunwaayee ke liye manzuri di thi
 One of these women was Sarah Bowdon, while the other was Meenakshi Jaffa Bodan, who accused Chaudhary of sexual harassment and defamation

 Anderson said that Chaudhary raped her once daily when she went to her house for dinner

 As soon as Rajshree went to sleep, Chaudhary tortured her
 haalanki isyon utpeedanke baavjood wo hot yoga karti rahi, kyonki tab use laga ki agar usne yoga bich main hi chhod diya, to uski zindagi khatm ho jaaegi
 But after this, Chaudhary persisted with him many times

 Review: diarector kii film he sikret superstar, dangal ke baad aamir ko dekhnaa dilachaspakamazor kadiyanyah film masala film nahin he or kaaphi gahan baton ke saath aage badhati he, jiskaa jaayaka shaayad sabhi ko pasand naa aaye, film kaaphi dhime dhime chalati he yani isaki raftaar kamjor he, jisko edit karke or crisp kiya jaataa to zyada dilachasp ban jaati 
 The story of the film is simple but if the treatment is filled with more suspense then it would probably look more interesting, although those who like this kind of cinema will definitely go to the theater

 Due to the law being caught, the criminals caught are easily missed, so there should be strict rules on snatching
 dilli hycourt ne maamle ko behad gambhirtha se liya he
 The court has asked the police why snatching is not classified as organized crime
 Is the Delhi Police waiting for an incident like Nirbhaya, will the police think of making changes only if a major incident happens

 Addressing the rally, PM Modi said, 'the result of your immense blessings and cooperation is that today India's land is ringing from land to space
 ' unhone kaha, 'mujhe bataaya gaya ki devegoda ji ke bete (kumaraswamy) ne kaha he ki centre main phir modi sarkaar ban gai to wo raajnneeti se sanyas le lenge
 Before the 2014 elections, Deve Gowda himself said the same thing
 lekin mere piem banane ke baad sanyas liya kya

 piem modi(pm Modi) ne kaha - 2019 ye chunaav rashtrawaad or parivaarwaad ke bich kaa he
 Nation is between First and Family First
 karnataka main is parivaarwaad ke pratik hai congress or jedies
 Both parties are as disconnected from the public as much as they are connected to their family
 inke liye aapaki aavashyaktaaen nahin, desh kii jaruratein nahin, balki apana swaarth mahatvapurn he
 The commission is their mission
 jab parivaar kii hi chintaa hoti he, to vahiin kwatroki or mishael mamaa jaise dallalon ko paala-posa jaataa he
 From Bofors to helicopter scams like sins are committed there
 congress kii kerani dekhie, vot kharidne ke liye ab usne bacchon or garbhvatee mahilaon ke haq kaa paisa bhi lut liya he
 He has added another scam in this Lok Sabha election

 Hundreds of crores of rupees have been sent to Delhi for elections from where the Congress government is in Madhya Pradesh
 ye paise kuposhan ke shikaar bacchon ke liye the, maasoom bacchon kii bhukh mitaane ke liye the
 But the Congress is so ruthless, that it even snatched the morsel of the poor children

 Congress and JDS are also against nationalists, those who protect the nation

 inke paas sultan ke utsav ke liye paisa he, lekin hampi ke gaurav ko yaad karne ke liye inke paas paise kam pad jate hai
 It is important to be careful with those who ask for proof of the valor of our sons in order to garner some votes only

 The Prime Minister said that his intention of corruption and fraud is the same, which the farmer of Karnataka is also suffering
 aaj kya kaaran he ki karnataka kaa ye 'bhad khanja' pani kii boond-boond ke liye taras rahaa he

 kulbhushan jadhav ke maamle ko lekar jab bharat international court of justise main gaya tha tab ise saahasik lekin chaunkaane vaala faisla kaha gaya tha
 The reason for this was that after 18 years, India approached the International Court of Justice on a matter
 aamtaur par bharat pakistan ke saath kisi bhi prakaar ke vivaad ko lekar antarrashtriya manch par jane se bachataa rahaa he kyonki uskaa kahana yah he ki bharat or pakistan ke bich vivaad main kisi tisare ke hastkshep kii koi jarurat nahin he
 But the speed that India showed in the Kulbhushan Jadhav case and the way the International Court of Justice hurriedly overcame Pakistan would be called a huge victory for India
 international court of justise ke mukhya jaj roni abraham ne naa sirf kulbhushan yadav kii faansee par roak laga di, balki pakistan kii tamaam daleelon ko sire se khaarij kar diya
 In the Kulbhushan Yadav case, there were 5 special things in India's victory
 1
 The judgment of Ronnie Abraham, the head of the International Court of Justice consisting of a 15-judge bench, was unanimous in the judgment that means that all the judges agreed with the decision
 court ne pakistan kii daleelon ko khaarij karte hue kaha ki kulbhushan jadhav kii faansee par is court kaa antim faisla aane tak puri tarah se roak lagaai jaae
 Not only this, the court also ordered Pakistan what measures are being taken by the Government of Pakistan to stop the hanging of Kulbhushan Yadav and what steps are being taken about it
 un sab kii jaankaree vistaar se is court ke saamne rakhi jaae
 2
 pakistan ne international court of justise main apni taraf se yah tark diya tha ki kulbhushan jadhav ko fouran faansee dene ko lekar ashanka bekaar he, kyonki unke paas pakistan kii oonchi adaalat main apil karne kaa or dayaa yachika daakhil karne kaa rasta abhi khulaa hua he or pakistan ke kanoon ke mutabik iske liye unhen dedh sau dinon kaa samay milegaa
 But the International Court of Justice said in its judgment that the apprehension that India has expressed that Kulbhushan Jadhav may be hanged even before the final verdict is arrived is not baseless given the circumstances
 court ne kaha ki bharat ne apni baat sabit karne ke liye jo tark die hai or jis tarah se kulbhushan jadhav ke maamle main puri nyaayik prakriya ko gupt rakhaa gaya he use dekhte hue bharat kii ashanka bebuniyaad nahin he
 3
 justise roni abraham ne vistaar se is baat kaa zikr kiya ki kis tarah bharat ke baar baar koshish ke baavjood kulbhushan jadhav ko lekar counslar acces nahin diya gaya or kis tarah se yah vienna samjhaute kaa ulanghan he jiske daayre main bharat or pakistan donon aate hai
 Under the Vienna Agreement, if a citizen of any country is arrested in another country, then that country has the right to provide judicial assistance to its citizen
 kulbhushan jadhav ke maamle main bharat ne pakistan se ab tak 16 baar counslar acces ke liye anurodh kiya he, lekin pakistan ne ise ansuna kar diya
 Pakistan tried to argue in the Hague international court that the Vienna Agreement does not provide for judicial assistance to those caught on espionage charges
 lekin pakistan kii is daleel ko puri tarah se khaarij karte hue justise roni abraham ne kaha kii vienna samjhaute main kahin aisa nahin likhaa he ki jin logon ko jasusi ke aarope main pakadaa jayega unhen yah suvidha nahin milegi
 In the matter of giving counselor access, Justice Abraham has not yet given any direct order to Pakistan, but after the way Pakistan's arguments have been canceled, there will be a lot of pressure on Pakistan that it will give India to Kulbhushan Jadhav Give counselor access to the case
 4
 The International Court of Justice said on Thursday that Kulbhushan Jadhav will not be hanged until the final verdict is arrived
 court ne kaha ki pakistan ne kulbhushan yadav ke upar jo aarope lagaae hai unke sahi yaa galat hone ke bare main court philhal koi tippanee nahin kar rahaa he, kyonki uski jaanch baad main hogi
 But here too Pakistan suffered a setback as the court made it clear in the judgment that the circumstances under which Kulbhushan Jadhav was arrested is a matter of dispute
 bharat yah lagaataar kahata rahaa he ki kulbhushan jadhav kaa apharan kiya gaya, jabaki pakistan ne aarope lagaaya he ki unhen jasusi karte hue baluchistan se giraftaar kiya gaya
 Now there will be pressure on Pakistan to put before the world all the evidence regarding the arrest of Kulbhushan Yadav
 5
 In the case of Kulbhushan Jadhav, the fast that India showed, the ground slipped under the feet of Pakistan
 kulbhushan jadhav kii faansee kii sajaa ke bare main pakistan ne 10 april ko jaankaree di thi
 Less than a month later, on 8 May, India went to the international court regarding this case
 bharat kii taraf se harish salve ne itane purajor tareeke se is maamle ko international court of justise ke saamne rakhaa kii chuttee hone ke baavjood 15 may ko is maamle kii vishesh sunwaayee hui
 Within 3 days, on May 18, India lashed out at Pakistan and got the international court's seal on almost all its demands
 ab puri duniya kii najar pakistan par hogi ki vah duniya kii sabase badi adaalat kaa faisla kis tarah se lagu karata he

 kya isa messiah kabhi bharat aae the? yah sawaal kaaphi vivaadaaspad he
 However, one fact is known that the description of 18 years of the life of Jesus Christ is not found in the 'new Testament'
 isa messiah ke jivan ke in gumnaam saalon ko 'silent iers', 'lost iers' yaa 'missing iers' bhi kaha jaataa he
 There is no mention in the Bible of the life of Jesus from age 13 to age 29
 bibisi kii ek documentry main bataaya gaya tha ki isa messiah ek buddha bhikshu the
 However, earlier in many books, Jesus had come to India
 1887 main ek roosi yuddh samvaadadaata nicholas notovich ne daawa kiya tha ki usne ladakh main hemis monastery main rakhe document 'life of saint isa, best of da sans of main' kaa adhyayan kiya tha
 Jesus is the Arabic name of Jesus in Islam
 notovich kii theory french bhashaa main 1894 main prakashit hui thi
 Russian scholar Nicholas Notovich visited India, Tibet and Afghanistan in the 19th century and is said to have spent much time in a Tibet Buddhist monastery of Leh
 daawa kiya jaataa he ki nicholas ne ek document kaa anuwaad kiya tha jisamen isa (jisas) kii kahani bataai gai thi
 According to this story, Jesus was born in a poor Israeli family in the first century
 ek lamas ne notovich ko yah bhi bataaya tha ki isa messiah ne 13 se 29 varsh kii umr main monastery main gyaan praapt kiya tha
 The Lama had said that Jesus was the great angel and the best of all the Dalai Lamas
 yahaan se shiksha lekar vah jerusalem pahunche or israel ke maseehaa yaa rakshak ban gaye
 a veteran monastery lama told Acnews Agency that Christ had initiated Buddhism in India and was deeply influenced by the Buddha's ideas and rules
 yah bhi kaha jaataa he ki jisas ne kai pavitra shaharon jaise jagannatha, rajgrih or banaras main diksha di or isaki vajah se brahman naaraaz ho gaye or unhen bahishkrut kar diya gaya
 Jesus then fled to the Himalayas and continued to take Buddhism
 german vidwaan holgar kerston ne jisas ke shuruaati jivan ke bare main likhaa tha or daawa kiya tha ki jisas sindh praant main aaryon ke saath jaakar bas gaye the
 Levi H
 doling, 19081908 main levi ech doling ne 'equarian gospel of jisas da christ' prakashit kiya jisamen usne daawa kiya tha ki use sari jaankaree supernatural takaton se mili he jo jisas kii jindagi kii sachhee kahani he
 It also described 18 years missing from the New Testament
 is kitaab ke mutabik, yuva jisas ne bharat, tibet, iran, greece or mistra deshon kaa bhraman kiya tha
 jesus-bbc, also in Kashmir, made a documentary called "jesus Was a Buddhist Monk" stating that Jesus was not crucified and went back to his favorite place when he was 30 years old
 
 documentry ke mutabik, jisas kii maut nahin hui thi or vah yahudiyon ke saath afghanistan chale gaye the
 According to the report, the locals confirmed that Jesus had spent many years in the Kashmir Valley and stayed there till the age of 80
 agar jisas ne 16 varsh kishoravastha main or jindagi ke aakhri 45 saal vyateet kiye to is hisaab se vah bharat, tibet or aas-paas ke ilaakon main kareeb 61 saal rahe
 Many locals believe that Jesus' tomb remains at the Roja Bal Shrine in Srinagar, Kashmir
 haalanki, aadhikarik taur par yah majaar ek madhyakaalin muslim upadeshak yuja asaf kaa makbara he
 It is also said that after the death of a great Buddhist, three scholars set out to search for their lama
 baudhon kii parampara main jab lamas kii mrityu hoti he to vidwaan grah-nakshatron ko dekhakar ek shishu kii khoj main ek lambii yatra par nikal padate hai
 It is believed to be the incarnation of the newborn lama
 ye vahi teen vidwaan the jo jisas ke janm kii raat ko bethleham pahunche the
 One also believes that Jesus came to India at the age of 13 with three scholars and grew up in India like a Buddhist
 osho ne bhi kahi isa messiah ke bharat aane kii batbhartiya darshanik osho ne bhi isa messiah ke bharat se sambandhit hone kii baat kahi he
 According to Osho, 'whenever someone is thirsty for truth, he gets excited in India spontaneously
 achaanak purab kii yatra par nikal padataa he or yah keval aaj kii hi baat nahin he
 2500 years ago, Pythagoras came to India in search of truth
 isa messiah bhi bharat aae the
 According to Osho, there is no mention in the Bible between the ages of 13 and 30 of Jesus Christ, and this was almost his entire life, because at the age of 33 he was crucified
 teraa se 30 tak 17 saalon kaa hisaab bible se gaayab he! itane samay ve kahaan rahe? aakhir bible main un saalon ko kyon nahin ricard kiya gaya? unhen jaanboojh kar choda gaya he, ki isayat moulik dharm nahin he, ki isa messiah jo bhi kah rahe hai ve use bharat se laae hai
 "when Jesus came to India - Buddhism was very lively, though Buddha had died
" gautam buddha ke paanch sau saal baad jisas yahaan aae the
 But Buddha had created such a huge movement, such a huge storm that even then the entire country was submerged in it
 antat: jisas kii mrityu bhi bharat main hui! or isai ricards is tathy ko nazarandaaj karte rahe hai
 The book of Fifth Gospel also supports the same claim that Jesus Christ visited India from 13 to 29 years
 19veen or 20veen shatabdi main kai theories saamne ain jisamen daawa kiya gaya ki 12 se 30 varsh kii aayu ke bich main jisas bharat aae the
 However, modern mainstream Christian scholars have rejected all these theories
 in vidwaanon ke mutabik, jisas ke jivan ke is samay ke bare main kuch bhi spasht gyaat nahin he
 Christian Scholars Reject - All scholars completely reject Jesus' claim to visit India
 scollar marcus borg kaa kahana he ki jisas ke bharat jane kaa daawa or unka buddha dharm se sambandh kaa koi bhi aitihaasik aadhaar nahin he
 There are many similarities between the teachings of Buddha and Jesus, says Leslie Holden, but these comparisons began after contact with missionaries in the 19th century
 jisas or buddha dharm kaa sambandh kaa koi bhi vishwasaneey aitihaasik sakshya maujuud nahin he
 Different scholars have given different theories on this subject

 muhalle ke tamaam gharon ko jodatii yah vishaal khuli saarvajanik jagah baar-baar bhar jaati he chachcho or lalana ke antarman ke gheron se
 This is the form of plot
 jo hamen dikhaata he chachcho / bahanji or lalana kii ichchhaaon or unke jivan kii paristhitiyon ke bich kii na pat sakane vaali duuri
 The same distance remains in the reality of these women themselves and their reality seen by the society
 nirantar tirohit hoti rahati hai ve samaaj ke dekhe jane main
 But the brothers / sisters and Lalna also face their inner conflicts and struggles 
 us apaar sidhe-sachche saahas se jo saamaanya jindagiyon kaa swabhaav ban jaataa he
 Gitanjali Shri has engraved the senses, everyday tastes, touches, smells, scenes of these women's domestic life in their entire quality
 maut ke tale chalate yaadon ke silsile main chaaya rahata he nivid dukh
 As the past does not pass, Tirohit's character 'lallana and nephew', who derives the meaning of his life through memories, becomes inseparable from the departed children
 or chachcho swayan rup leti hai inhen yaadon main
 Book excerpt: The Tirohitable Fan The one that the thief once tried to lift while walking, putting a rope in the courtyard from the roof, as if he takes a fish from the pond! After that, the uncle, Lallana, or the henchmen, put a tattoo on the courtyard
 garmi kii raat!garmi kii raaton main kya kiya jaataa he ?chat par soya jaataa he
 But the roof is of the entire locality, the crowd is crowded, the noise and the noise, like the moon
 chupake chupake sahali-sahali
 Pranks like the wind
 kahin munder par suraahi rakhi he ki raat ko uthakar sondhi mitti kii mahak kaa pani pi lo
 Somewhere there are blank sheets on the cot, the pillows have been twisted to make them tasty, they are laughing loudly
 jaraa alag kisi ne angeethee bhi jala lee he or paraat se narm loiyaan lekar bel rahaa he, garm-garm phulke senk rahaa he
 The squirrel is awake to sleep and is unable to give up hope that his name is also part of the dough, two steps forward, twenty steps back and back
 lebaranam house kii chat
 Still sometimes called the roof of bulls
 atharahavin shatee main yah sarrafon kaa mohalla tha or unke raja ne ek chat ke neeche yah rahane-bechney kii jagah kar di
 Somewhere high, low ceiling somewhere
 har mausam kii niraali chat
 Support ceilings of every relationship dabaavon se mukt chat
 Leaping from limitless to limitless
 attharah sau sattaavan main in gharon main na jane kitne baagi chhipe ki angrejon kii tukdi ai to chat kii raah ghar-dar-ghar laanghate hue mohalle neeche kud jaaen or faraar! sunate hai ki chamanji ke do pardada bhaaiyon main ek baagiyon ke saath tha, doosraa angrejon ke, or un marpet ke dinon main donon ek duusare se chhipaakar apni toliwaalon ko sharan dete
 One day a hide from here was running through the roof and one from there was coming to hide on the same path of the roof
 raah main takaraa gaye donon or upar se neeche kii chat par ja gire jisase ek ke pair main pad gai moch
 In such a situation, with the help of the other two hands, he pulled it up from the balcony and then disappeared
 gaayab hona aaj bhi aasaan he is chat par
 Somebody's house is two-storied, someone's three, some place is zina, and iron ladder is attached to the wall of the courtyard
 chat par badi ai darkhton kii daalen, khambe, chajje, tankiyaan
 One step is the oat, the second step is the oat and nine-two-eleven
 yahi jaanakar sudhirchandra 1942 main bhaage, jab police pahunch gai unke baba ko pakadaney, jo andolan main sakriy the
 Hey Bacha Bhag, his grandmother shouted
 tohaar baba te he nahin, ye jallaadan tohike bhoonj denge
 Abused abuses, then traitors, uniformed, British ponies
 majaa yah ki deshadrohi nahin to bade deshpremi bhi nahin the sudhirchandra
 Inter, BA were doing something and there was only so much aspiration to get a good job, black, white, yellow, red, under which
 oudhami baba future na bigaad den, sir par paanv rakhkar bhaage
 But this time the one who was running from there on the roof, did not indicate any such attitude that come close, i will give support
 ek taraf neem kii daal duusari taraf daaroga kii munch! kehete hai sudhirchandra neem kii tahani par lataka hi chaahate the ki peeche se daadi chilla padi, are maregaa, khud lathi thak-thak karke jeena chadhane main marane-marane ko hoti
 Sudhirchandra went into a tizzy and the cleanliness with which he got into the arms of the prisoner felt that this was his intention! Taken to the police station, the report was recorded, leave it, they give invisible mustache to them, and Daroga said, "I have been given leave but i have also attended in 1942, then in the examination of the Provincial Judicial Service, Grace When i got Marks, i saw my grandmother make me an officer
 chat kii yahi sab sifat jaanakar pankhaachor ne apana naseeb aajamaaya
 'I wonder how this fan suddenly started to daggle
 ' chachcho bataati
 "chor-chor, i screamed," Lallana would tell
 'main to uthi ki muay usee ko rassi samet khinch don neeche par tumhaari chachcho ko chadar kii padi thi
 Kill all the summer clothes that were opened! ”hearing the thief, people suddenly started running everywhere on the roof
 kitnon ne kaha, bas pakad main aake chhot gaya
 Someone said, the oil slipped out of the long-standing nappy hands
 bandar-sa tha thigana, koi or bolaa, laga gaya chalaang anant main
 The third came came from Khonsa Khons
 bahuterey kuch na bole
 Engaged in dark kisses in the stampede
 chachaa or main neeche aangan kii taraf bhaage to chachcho or lalana ek hi chadar kii kheenchaatani main kahin blouse chadha rahi thim, kahin dhoti khons rahi thim

 Delhi High Court has reprimanded the Delhi government for the pathology labs running illegally in thousands
 court ne dilli sarkaar ke principal secetry health ko talab karke 17 disambar ko pesh hone ke aadesh die he or poocha he ki dilli sarkaar ne ab tak aisi pathological labs ko band karne ke liye koi kaarywahi kyon nahin kii, khud principal secetry health aakar court ko bataae
 The High Court said during the hearing that why the Delhi government is not following the orders of the Supreme Court which is necessary to run the pathological lab
 dilli main is vaqt sirf 132 labs hi aisi he jinako chalaane kii kanoonee anumati pathology lab chalaane vaale sanchalko ke paas he
 But thousands of illegal pathological labs in Delhi are running indiscriminately
 court ne dilli sarkaar ko fatkaar lagaate hue kaha ki aakhir hamaare adeshon kaa paalan abhi tak kyon nahin kiya gaya kyon is tarah se avaidh chal rahi pathology lab par chapa daalkar un logon ko chinhit kiya kiya jo niyamon kanoonon ko taak par rakh kar naa sirf aam logon kii jaan jokhim main daal rahe hai balki gaiyr kanoonee tareeke se pathology bhi chalaa rahe hai
 The court was angered that after hearing the PIL, the Delhi government issued only one public notice, advertising it in two newspapers
 lekin is tarah kii pathology labs par lagaam lagane ke liye koi bhi adhikari apane daftar se nikal ke jamini sach jaanane ke liye pathology labs tak gaya hi nahin
 In 2010, the Clinical Establishment Act was implemented for Union Territories on behalf of the Central Government
 kai rajyon main sarkaron ne ise lagu kar liya he lekin rajdhani dilli main dilli sarkaar ise lagu karne ke bajaay ek nayaa bill lagu karnaa chaahati he
 However, it is not yet decided how long the government will be able to implement this bill and how strict will be taken in this new law to curb thousands of pathology labs running illegally

 Sisodia asked, "ma'am, where are you?" Priya was completely confused in such an environment

 NSG officers found an alternative way to reach them — this path was the grand staircase of the Heritage Wing

 Bullets and pellets were completely pierced by Sunil Jodha's body

 This was a risky move as there was no one to cover them

 They decided that they had to surprise the terrorists by attacking them suddenly

 He saw huge chairs and tables scattered in front of him
 unhone kaartoos peti ko tatola
 There was only one grenade left
 unhone grenade kaa pin ukhada or lounj main oochaal diya
 The grenade exploded with a loud noise, shattering the windows
 unni is visphot ke bich bheetar ghus gaye

 Now it was time to search for terrorists

 The corridors around the atrium were filled with mutilated bodies
 unke commando hawaldaar digharaam ne fusfusaakar kaha, ''sahabji, in laashon ko dekho
 The corpses were blooming
 aatanki hamalaa hue 36 ghante biit chuke the
 The bad smell was floating in Fiza
 sade hue khaane or sadi hui laashon kii miji-juli badboo thi
 The problem was that these corpses could not be removed because the NSG could only do this after the 'render safe procedure' was completed after cleaning up the booby trap
 iske liye jaruri tha ki imaaraton se aatankiyon kaa safaya kiya jaae
 Sheoran, however, was worried about Unni and was looking for him

 His body was lying in a pile of frozen blood

 Unni was hit by AK-47 bullets

 Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi can visit the ongoing Mahakumbh in Allahabad
 haalanki modi ke jane kii taarikh abhi tay nahin he lekin mana ja rahaa he ki modi 7 farvari ke baad hi kumbh main jaaenge
 There is a meeting of the Sant Samaj at Mahakumbh in Allahabad on 7 February
 mana ja rahaa he ki is baithak main sant samaaj koi bada faisla le saktaa he
 In view of this, Modi's visit to Kumbh is considered very important
 desh kaa antarim bajet pesh hone main ab kuch ghanton kaa samay bachaa he
 This budget presented before the Lok Sabha elections is considered to be very important economically and politically
 haalanki is baar ke bajet main thodaa badlaav hua he
 This time on 1 February, Acting Finance Minister Piyush Goyal will present the budget instead of regular Finance Minister Arun Jaitley
 lekin bajet se pehle yah jaananaa jaruri he ki beete 1 saal main aarthik morche or aam janata se judi hui chizon ke morche par desh kahaan khadaa he
 Today we will mention this in this report
 vitt mantri arun jetali ne 1 farvari 2018 ko aakhri purna bajet pesh kiya
 Before this budget, on January 31, the Sensex was at the level of 35 thousand 970
 vahiin nifti 11,020 ke str ke paar kaarobaar kar rahaa tha
 a year later on 31 January 2019, the Sensex is at a level of 35, 750
 jabaki nifti kareeb 50 ankon kii teji ke saath 10,700 ke str par he
 According to Kedia Commodity Managing Director Ajay Kedia, this budget can become the deciding factor in the stock market
 1 saal main rupayapichley saal ke bajet se pehle 31 janvari 2018 ko dollar ke mukaable rupaya 63
 Was at the level of 66
 jabaki 1 saal baad 31 janvari 2019 ko ek dollar, 71
 06 is equal to Rs
 1 saal main sona-chaandi31 janvari 2018 ko sona kii keemat 31, 230 rupee prati das gram thi to vahiin 1 saal baad iskaa bhav 34,200 rupee prati das gram par he
 Talking about silver, its price was at Rs 42,200 per kg on 31 January 2018
 vahiin 31 janvari 2019 ko yah 41,400 rupee ke str par he
 Petrol-diesel in 1 year: The price of petrol 72 in Delhi on 31 January a year ago
 92 rupee prati litre thi to vahiin 2019 main isi din yah 71
 09 is priced at Rs
 dijal kii baat karen to yah 31 janvari 2019 ko 65
 81 at the rate of Rs
 Per liter, whereas on the same day a year ago it was at Rs
 64
 1 saal main alpijijanvari 2018 main desh kii rajdhani dilli main sabsidi ke saath alpiji silendar kii keemat 495
 64 was Rs
 vahiin vartmaan main yah 494
 99 at the price of Rs
 1 saal main repo rateriserv bank of india ne janvari 2018 main repo rate ko 6 fisadi par barkaraar rakhaa tha
 Right now it is 6
 5 fisadi par barkaraar he
 If compared then 0 in 1 year
 5 fisadi repo rate bad gaya he
 Understand in easy language, increasing the repo rate increases the burden of EMI on home loan customers
 repo rate ke badhane ke baad bank bhi lone par apni byaaj daron ko badha dete hai
 Inflation rate in 1 year, the inflation data for January has not yet come, but when compared to December, this year the annual inflation rate based on wholesale prices has come down to 3 in December
 80 fisadi rahi he
 Whereas this figure 3 in December 2017 a year ago
 58 fisadi ke str par aa gai thi 
 If you talk about retail inflation, then in December it is 2
 19 rahi
 Whereas 1 year ago 2017 in December based on the Consumer Price Index 5 in December 2017
 21 fisadi par thi

 Abhishek, who started his career with half a dozen flop films, tasted success through 'yuva', 'sarkar', 'guru' and 'dostana' and did not hesitate to accept it
 Only after that his confidence has increased
 unhone kaha, ‘‘safalataa se aatmavishvaas badhata hi he

 intajaar rahegaa) ‬A post shared by Taapsee Pannu (@taapsee) on May 21, 2018 at 12:04am PDT Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Brussels next month has been postponed as the European Union has not responded to India's proposal
 sutron ne bataaya he ki pradhanmantri modi ab canada kiyatra ke saathdo europea deshon france or germany kaa daura bhi karenge
 Remember that there were also suggestions from India to the European Union on the dates of the Prime Minister's visit in the second week of April
 sutron ke mutabik, europea sangh kii ore se iske bare main jawaab nahin aane par sarkaar brusselles ke daure ke bagaiyr hi pradhanmantri ke yatra kaarykram ke saath aage bad gai he
 When asked the reason behind this unusual reaction to India's suggestion, sources did not explicitly say anything, although it said it was an internal matter of the 28-member European Union
 atakalon ke mutabik, europea sangh kii ore se bharat ke prastaav kaa jawaab nahin dene kaa ek kaaran yah bhi ho saktaa he ki bhartiya machuaaron kii hatya ke aaropee, do italvi marinon ke maamle main sunwaayee main hui deree se europea sangh pareshaan he
 Federica Mogherini, the new head of the European Union's foreign policy affairs, has made several statements on the issue that were uncomfortable to India
 doosraa kaaran yah bhi ho saktaa he ki federika ukraine sankat or isamen rus kii bhoomika ko lekar chintaa jataati rahi hai or is maamle par bharat ne pashchimi deshon kii pankti main khadaa hone se inkaar kar diya he
 At the same time, many small countries in Europe have expressed their unhappiness about the postponement of the tour, because they saw it as an opportunity to advance india-eu relations

 cabinet ministar main kisko kya mila- The Shiv Sena's defiance against the Narendra Modi government at the Center remains intact
 endie main sahyogi shivasena ne ab modi sarkaar kii mahatvakankshi mudra yojana ko lekar nishaanaa saadhaa he
 In the Shiv Sena mouthpiece 'saamana', where the dues of 'pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana', aimed at promoting self-employment, have been named, there has been mention of those who have gone abroad after dipping thousands of crores of debt
 ‘saamana’ main chape sampadakeey lekh main reserve bank kii ore se mudra yojana ke tahat baante gaye karjon ke bakaae ko lekar jataai gai chintaa kaa hawala dete hue baat shuru kii gai he
 The article notes that the Reserve Bank has expressed concern about the arrears of loans disbursed under the 'mudra' scheme
 is bakaae karj kii raashi 11 hajaar karod rupee tak pahunch gai he
 The mountain of arrears and sinking debt of government and private banks has become the subject of serious discussion over the years
 upar se hajaaron karod rupee kaa karj dubaakar kuch udyogpatiyon ke desh ke baahar bhaag jane se is vishay ko or bhi ‘baghaar’ mil gai he
 On this background, the outstanding amount of the scheme like 'mudra' has also reached a few thousand crore rupees
 isliye uski bhi ‘khabar’ media main prakashit hui he
 In the article, it has been written on behalf of the Shiv Sena that the currency scheme was beaten very harshly, but do not be surprised if the concern raised by the Reserve Bank on the outstanding amount of 'mudra' becomes a matter of discussion
 ‘saamana’ ne likhaa he- “rigerv bank kii report ke anusaar mudra yojana ke tahat 2017-18 tak 2
 Loans worth Rs 46 lakh crore have been disbursed, out of which 40 percent has been given to women entrepreneurs and 33 percent to 'stand Up India'
 kul 4
 81 crore small scale entrepreneurs have been allocated loans under the scheme last year
 isi kii bakaayaa raashi 11 hajaar karod rupee tak pahunch gai he
 This 'small' burden to our economy, already burdened with debt due to debt, is now beginning to outweigh the burden
 'lekh main aage likhaa gaya he, 'vaise bade udyojakon dwaara kai saalon se bakaayaa rakhe gaye kuch lakh karod rupee or ‘mudra’ kii chote or madhyam vyavsaayikon ke paas atake 11 hajaar karod rupee donon bhi baaten bhinn hai
 Nearly 2 under the Mudra scheme
 46 lakh karod ke karj vitarit kiye gaye he
 While the loan disbursed to large industries is worth billions of rupees
 mudra yojana ke sabhi laghu-madhyam or mahila udyojak hai
 His business turnover is very small
 unka vyavsaay sthir hone main or munafa prapti main thodaa samay lagegaa hi
 Above all, he has had to face decisions like demonetisation and GST in the initial days
 is nirnay kaa desh kii arthvyavastha par pratikul asar pad rahaa hoga to uskaa prabhaav chote-madhyam udyogon ke kaarobaar par bhi padegaa hi
 The pace of economic development of the country has decreased in the last two-and-a-half years
 uskaa bhi khamiyaja mudra yojana ke udyogon tathaa udyojakon ko uthaanaa padaa he
 The Shiv Sena has blamed the Modi government's decision to some extent for the Rs 11,000 crore outstanding arrears of the 'mudra Yojana'
 lekh main likhaa gaya he ki ‘haalanki ‘mudra’ ke sabhi bakaaedaar ‘eemaandaar’ yaa ‘halaaton se kamjor’ hai, aisa nahin he
 Apart from this, arrears are always arrears, every industry should pay the loan installment regularly
 halaat, sarkaar kii niti, vaishvik teji or mandi kii ore ungali dikhaakar har udyojak bakaayaa rakhane laga to desh kaa kya hoga?bakaayaa karj koi bhi ho uskaa bhaar arthvyavastha par or har naagarik par hi padataa he
 That is why the Reserve Bank of India, which owes arrears of 11 thousand crores to small-medium industries, should be worried and if the bank has expressed it then there is nothing wrong in this
 sirf kuch lakh karod kaa karj bakaayaa rakhanevaale or dubaanewaale bade udyogpatiyon ke liye ek niyam or nai ummid se ‘mudra’ yojana ke tahat chote karj lekar ‘start ap’ kar udyog vyavsaay main ‘stand ap’ hone kii koshish karanevaale nae udyojakon ke liye doosraa niyam nahin hona chahie
 Banks should try to reduce the debt owed to them, but the creation of new entrepreneurs may cause 'wounds', nothing should happen

 The High Court told LG that before this, the Delhi High Court in its judgment on August 4, 2016, while giving a ruling on the rights fight between Delhi Government vs Lieutenant Governor, has said that the Lieutenant Governor is the administrative head of Delhi
 dilli sarkaar alji kii marji ke bina kanoon nahin bana sakati

 dilli sarkaar kii maang he ki centre sarkaar nai dilli or endiemasi ilaake ko apane adheen rakhkar baaki dilli ko aaazaad kar de
 What are those 10 arguments of Kejriwal government: 1
 chaparasi se lekar adhikariyon kii niyukti transfar-posting or unke khilaaf kaarywahi karne kaa adhikaar nahin rah gaya isliye sarkari mulajim chuni hui sarkaar ke aadesh nahin maanate
 2

 3

 4
 anti karpshan branch ko uparajyapal ke adheen kiye jane ke baad se sarkaar bhrasht karmchaariyon or adhikariyon ke khilaaf koi kaarywahi nahin kar paa rahi jisase sarkaar main bhrashtachar badha
 The campaign was pushed against the government's corruption
 5
 Due to the Lt
 Governor being the last authority to implement the policy decisions, the elected government could not implement many schemes
 6
 Many schemes like the CCTV scheme, plans to set up new mohalla clinics, home delivery of services, home delivery plans of ration were disrupted for a long time
 7
 It is necessary to send every file to the Lieutenant Governor for approval and the Lieutenant Governor sat on the files for a long time
 8
 The appointment of advisors and experts appointed by the government was rejected by the Lieutenant Governor which affected the government's work
 9
 He did not reverse the policy decision of the government due to the cabinet's advice not binding on the Lieutenant Governor

 tabhi ek din anti karpshan branch ne dilli police ke consteble ko rishwat kar maamle main giraftaar kar liya

 The central government also came to the rescue of the jawan

 It is from here that relations between the Delhi Government and the Central Government began to sour

 Bollywood has no style of its own
 puri duniya main bahut sari nrity sheliyaan hai or hamen yah ek hi geet main dekhne ko milti hai
 Hence it is a specialty of Bollywood
 unhone kaha ki vakt ke saath nai sheliyaan aa rahi hai, jaise hip-hop ab lokapriy hota ja rahaa he, aap dekhie nartak iskaa apane nrity main mishran karte ja rahe hai

 However, 45-year-old Madhuri is also ready for her new innings in Bollywood

 darasal, shraddha ne dabbu ratanani ke calendar ke liye apane sir par america mul prajati kaa ek headress pahana tha
 Because of this, they are accused of misrepresenting the culture of North American residents
 diet sabya naam ke insta pej ke mutabik, america mul prajati ke sadsy bardaashat nahin karenge ki unki aadhikarik veshbhusha yaa headgrs kaa istemaal koi or kare
 Significantly, even before, film stars and Hollywood celebs have been accused of tampering with culture

 Apart from this, Beyoncé was also seen dancing in Indian costumes in a video by British rock band Coldplay
 ladi gaaga ne burke main parform karte hue ek video banaaya tha
 The name of this video was also Burka
 saanskrithik viniyog se jude ek artical ke mutabik, bindi lagaana yaa burka pahananaa kisi bhi myne main galat nahin he
 But using these things for music performance or publicity can be called a manipulation of culture

 Reliance Jio ne apane samar sarprise ofer ko waapas lene kaa elaan kiya he
 The reason behind this announcement is that this offer is against the regulation of the Telecom Regulatory Authority
 TRAI ke chairman aar es sharma ne kaha he ki TRAI ne Jio se complimentry sarvice ofer ko band karne kaa aadesh diya he
 The TRAI chairman has told PTI, 'we have examined this offer and found that it is against the regulatory framework
 isliye hamane isapar roak lagane ko kaha he
 After trai's order, Jio announced the withdrawal of the summer surprise offer
 haalanki zyaadaatar yugers ne prime sarvice ke liye sabsakrib kara liya he or wo ab samar sarprise ofer kaa hissaa hai
 In such a situation, how the offer was ended by simply reducing the date of summer surprise offer subscription is beyond comprehension
 Jio ne TRAI ke aadesh ke baad ek ssetment jari kiya he
 It said, 'jio is in favor of fully implementing trai's suggestion and within a few days the company announces withdrawal of the complementary offer for three months' after 24 to 48 hours
 According to the Economic Times report, close to the company has told that registration for summer surprise will be stopped within 24 to 48 hours
 haalanki khabar likhe jane tak website kai yugers ne bataaya he ki unhen abhi bhi richarge karne par samar sarprise ofer milane kaa massej aa rahaa he
 The company has also made it clear that those who have already paid for summer surprise and prime subscription will continue to receive offers for three months
 iske alaava company ne apni website par yah saaf taur par likhaa he ki agle kuch dinon tak samar sarprise ofer liya ja saktaa he
 April 15 was the last date for summer surprise and today is April 7, which means 8 days are left
 ab company agle kuch dinon tak ise jari rakhane kii baat kar rahi he
 It is possible to continue the subscription till 10 April
 samar sarprise ofer band karnaa Jio ke liye phaayde kaa sauda!trai ke is aadesh se Jio ko nuksaan nahin, balki phayda ho saktaa he
 Because people will subscribe to the prime offer as soon as possible after this announcement
 chunki yah saaf nahin he ki kab se logon ko samar sarprise ofer milane band honge, isliye log is ummid main prime sarvice lete rahenge
 According to the company, 72 million people have subscribed to Prime Membership
 ek pahalu yah bhi he ki jinhone abhi tak prime sabsakripshan nahin lee he unase ummid he ki wo age nahin hi lenge chaahe aakhri date 15 april ho yaa 30
 Continuing the subscription for a few days even after announcing the termination of the summer surprise offer, is it not against trai's order? Jio Prime offers will continue even after trai's order, users can avail Prime Subscription
 isaki aakhri taarikh ab bhi 15 april hi he
 There will not be free data for three months like the summer surprise offer, but cheaper data will definitely be available
 303 rupee main har din 1GB 4G data diya jayega
 However, this decision has seen a surge in the shares of other telecom companies Airtel, Idea and rcom
 share bazaar khulte hi mukesh ambani ke bhai anil ambani kii company Rcom ke shares main 0
 a 25 percent increase has been recorded
 iske alaava airtel or edia ke shares main oochaal darj kii gai he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has expressed deep concern over the fact that many departments of the government keep fighting against each other by suing each other
 unhone kaha ki is se court kaa keemtee samay bhi barbaad hota he or sarkaar kaa kaamkaaj bhi prabhavit hota he
 Modi said that till today he could not understand that when the government is one, what is the point of his departments fighting in court among themselves? Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday on Civil Services Day in Vigyan Bhawan, Delhi He was addressing about 600 officials who came from
 apni paathshaala main modi ne afasaron ko kai moolmantra die or unase kaha ki desh ko tarakkee ke raste par le jane ke liye unke paas abhi sabase sunaharaa mauka he kyonki unki sarkaar main amulchul badlaav ke liye jaruri raajnneetik ichhashakti he
 Modi said that people who are considered the most promising in the country come in civil services
 iske baavjood isaki kya vajah he ki aam logon ke man main afasaron ke prati 'bhav' kii jagah 'abhaav' he
 There is a need to reflect on this
 unhone kaha ki achche kaam kaa asar har jagah dikhataa he
 For example, when army personnel go to save people trapped in floods in Kashmir, they also clap at that time
 bhale hi baad main pathar phenkate hon
 Modi said in a light manner that many people reached here by coaching to go to civil services but now they have a lot of responsibility
 kareeb 45 minute ke apane bhaashan main modi ne afasaron ko hansaaya bhi or unhen gahari naseehat bhi di
 Modi said that the best advice for changing or improving the system can be given by the same officers who have worked for a long time in this system
 lekin anubhav bhi kai baar boj bhi ban jaataa he
 Many times, experienced officers start thinking that no new man should get a chance to do such work that he is applauded
 is soch ko badalane kii jarurat he kyonki desh tabhi aage badhegaa jab ek aadmi ke achche kaam ko doosraa aadmi or aage le jayega
 He said that new ideas need to be promoted because new people have new energy and new thinking
 chutile andaaj main modi ne kaha kis jile main kai baar officer aaj kal dinabhar kaaphi vyast rahete hai
 Because they are on the phone all day long
 unhone kaha ki soshal media kii takat ko vah samajhate hai lekin soshal media kaa istemaal afasaron ko samaaj ke hit ke kaam ke liye karnaa chahie naa kii samay kaatane ke liye yaa phir khud ko badhaava dene ke liye
 Giving an example, he explained that if social media is to be publicized that there will be vaccination in the entire city on this day and everybody comes to participate in it, then it was the right use of social media
 lekin usee soshal media par agar officer polio kii drops pilaate hue bachche ke saath apni photo laga kar khush hon to yah thik baat nahin he
 On the occasion of Civil Services Day, Modi also gave away prizes to selected officers of the year, whose works have brought a big change in the society

 Politics has not stopped since the Indian Army has carried out surgical strikes in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir

 rahul gandhi kaa loksabhaa main kisaanon par diya gaya bhaashan or usamen istemaal kiye gaye jumale twitor kii bhashaa kii yaad dilaate hai suut but kii sarkaar, aapkaa pradhanmantri
 Also tried to trap BJP like an MP
 bhari loksabhaa main nitin gadakari ke liye kahana ki wo dil se bolte hai or main unki tarif karata hum, jabaki gadakari loksabhaa main the bhi nahin
 With this, Rahul tried to spread suspicion in the BJP
 phir jaraa wo frem dekhie, rahul ke peeche yuva gaurav gogoi, sushmita dev, deepender huda, ravanit singh bittu or ek baaju main jyotiraditya sindhiya to duusari taraf tarik anwar or ye sab rahul gandhi ke chiyar leader bane hue the
 There was a point in Rahul's Ramlila Maidan and Lok Sabha speech that he did not deviate from the subject
 ramlila maidan main bhi unhone keval kisaanon kii baat kii, kisi ghar vaapasi yaa anya muddon ko nahin chuaa
 In the Lok Sabha also, with full preparation, he attacked the Prime Minister directly, taking chuckles equipped with figures
 aap is baat par sawaal uthaa sakate hai ki is vakt audyogic gharaanon par nishaanaa sadhana uchit he ki nahin magar kisaan or garibon ke hitaishi banane ke liye yah karnaa bhi majaburi he
 Rahul has led the government to surround the government on an issue which is the sad touch of the BJP
 central haul main bhi bijepi ke kai saansad nijee baatcheet main maanate hai ki isse sarkaar kii chhavi kharaab hui he or sarkaar kii image kisaan virdohi kii ban rahi he
 Till now those who were saying that Rahul has gone on leave during the land acquisition case would have got the answer now, but still it is not clear how strongly Rahul is ready to lead the Congress
 ramlila maidan kii raily se yah tay ho gaya he ki digvijay singh kaa kad aane vaale dinon main badhegaa kyonki wo raily kaa sanchaalan kar rahe the
 The elder generation of Congress also breathed a sigh of relief when they saw Motilal Vora and Antony on stage
 purv pradhanmantri se bhi bhaashan dilvaanaa ek sahi kadam tha
 The comments abhi tak aisa hota aayaa he ki rahul kisi mudde par bhaashan dete hai sadan main phir gaayab ho jate hai unhen is satr main apni maujuudagi kaa ahsaas karana hoga varanaa bijepi un par sansad main item number karne kaa aarope duhraane lagegi kyonki film main item number ek baar aata he or phir gaayab ho jaataa he
 If they have to bear the burden of the Congress on their shoulders, then they have to be serious about this task
 bahut ho gai chhuttiyaan, shuruuaat acchhee hui he bas is andaaj ko jari rakhen to mushkil bhi aasaan ho jaaegi
 For Nitin Gadkari in the full Lok Sabha, he says that he speaks from the heart and i praise him, even though Gadkari was not in the Lok Sabha
 isse rahul ne bijepi main andeh failaane kii koshish kii
 Then look at the frame, behind Rahul, young Gaurav Gogoi, Sushmita Dev, Deepender Hooda, Ravneet Singh Bittu and Jyotiraditya Scindia on one side, Tariq Anwar on the other and all these were the cheer leaders of Rahul Gandhi
 rahul ke ramlila maidan or loksabhaa ke bhaashan main ek baat rahi ki wo vishay se nahin bhatke
 Even at Ramlila Maidan, he only talked about farmers, did not touch any homecoming or other issues
 loksabhaa main bhi puri taiyaari ke saath aankadon se las chutkiyaan lete hue sidhe pradhanmantri par hamalaa bolaa
 You can question whether it is appropriate to target industrial houses at this time or not, but it is also compulsory to do this for the benefit of farmers and poor
 rahul ne ek aise mudde par sarkaar ko gherne kii aguwai kii he jo bijepi kii dukhati rag he
 In the Central Hall also many BJP mps believe in private conversation that this has tarnished the image of the government and the image of the government is becoming anti-farmer
 abhi tak jo yah kah rahe the ki jameen adhigrahan maamle ke dauraan rahul chuttee par chale gaye hai unhen ab jabaab mil gaya hoga magar abhi bhi yah tay nahin ho paa rahaa he ki rahul kitni shiddat se congress ko lead karne ke liye taiyaar hai
 The Ramlila Maidan rally has ensured that Digvijay Singh's stature will grow in the coming days as he was conducting the rally
 congress kii badi peedi ne bhi raahat kii saans lee jab manch par motilal vora or antony ko dekha
 Getting a speech from the former Prime Minister was a right step
 tippaniyan So far, it has been happening that Rahul gives a speech on some issue then disappears in the House, he will have to make his presence felt in this session or else BJP will repeat him accusing him of doing item number in Parliament because the item number one in the film The bar comes and then disappears
 yadi congress kaa bhaar unhen apane kandhe par sanbhaalanaa he to unhen apane ko is kaam ke bare main gambhir bananaa hoga
 Enough of the holidays, the start has been good, just continue this style and it will be easy
