 To know the condition of the pilgrims who have gone on the journey, the journey of Badrinath Dham, the team of Aaj Tak reached several places on the Yatra road and saw the condition of the ground

 Trains were immediately released from Badrinath so that somehow all the passengers could reach Joshimath
 aisa hua bhi ,magar yah khushi keval sau pachaas yatriyon ko hi naseeb ho pai
 The team of Aaj Tak somehow reached the end of Lambagad on foot, from which the road had already been closed
 tamaam aise hisse jo ek taraf alaknanda kaa raudra rup dekh rahe the to duusari taraf bhuskhalan kii maar jhel rahe the

 Some passengers were also started with the help of rope along the mountain

 Till date, the team also descended down the mountain from this dangerous path

 Whether old and young, everyone was in bad shape
 uttarakhand police ke teen sipaahi rassiyon ke sahare tirth yatriyon kii madad kar rahe the
 With the help of the same rope, Aaj Tak's team also reached restless travelers to get out of there somehow

 Vehicles were on the way that rain and landslides started again
 ek taraf kanchanganga kaa naala ufaan par tha to duusari taraf lamabgad parvat se bhuskhalan ho rahaa tha
 Those stranded in the middle can neither return to Badrinath nor visit Joshimath

 The shopkeeper said that as long as there is ration, he will not let anyone go hungry

 Manak Aggarwal, president of Congress's media department, said that the bjp's defeat in the upcoming assembly elections in Madhya Pradesh is certain
 joshi ne vahi kaha he jo party kaa haal he
 In time to come, every party worker will say that the Chief Minister's familyism has thrown the party out of power

 National Security Advisor (NSA) Ajit Doval arrived in Srinagar via an Indian Air Force (IAF) aircraft on the day the Narendra Modi government at the Center introduced the bill on Article 370 in the Rajya Sabha
 ab nau din bitne ke baad bhi vah ghati main hi deraa daale hue hai, or pradhanmantri karyaalay (PMO) ko live apadet bhej rahe hai
 The most powerful bureaucrat in the Modi government is currently operating from the State Intelligence Department's Gupakar Road office
 rajya ke ek varisht adhikari kaa kahana he, "unki (ajit dobhaal kii) maujuudagi ne balon ke bich samanvay sunishchit kar diya he

 According to one official, "it was a symbolic move, and it also ensured that all agencies work closely with each other
"

 There is something like Ajit Doval's journey from detective to becoming NSA, know 10 special things According to officials, the most important focus of NSA in his tour is on how to solve the issue of domestic terrorism

 Can there be a relationship between Bhojpuri songs and Sania Mirza? Does Sania Mirza know her own association with Bhojpuri film and music industry? They may or may not know, but it can be said with the claim that Sania has now become the icon of Bhojpuri songs
 bihar kii bhojpuri sangeet industry, hyderabad kii sania mirza ko 'tennis sansani' se kahin zyada sania kii khubsuurati or unki naak kii 'nathuni' ke liye pasand karti he, jo unhen bihar se jodatii he
 Even though searching, Sania and Bhojpuri music can not find any relationship far and wide, but there is something in Sania that connects them with Bhojpuri songs
 tabhi to ab tak darjanabhar se zyada bhojpuri gane sania par na sirf likhe gaye hai, balki kuch gaanon ne to lokapriyata ke tamaam record tod daale hai
 a Bhojpuri song is now raising people's heads and saying, 'sania Mirza Kat Nathuniya Jaan Marela'
 
 
 ' is geet ne to bhojpuri gaanon kii lokapriyata ke tamaam record dhwast kar die
 You can also see and listen to the following song: Bhojpuri lyricist and current Independent MLA Vinay Bihari wrote many songs on Sania Mirza, which was sung by Pawan Singh
 inamen ye gaanaa, 'sania mirza cat nathunia jaan marela
 
 
 The biggest hit was because it contained the word 'nathunia', which connects Sania with Bihar
 sania kii naak kii nathuni unki sundarataa ko kai guna badhaa detii he, isiilie bhojpuri sangeet ne sania ko hathonhaath lapak liya
 Famous Bhojpuri singer Pawan Singh has sung 3 songs alone on Sania Mirza, which is present on youtube
 vinay bihari kehete hai ki jis tarah kii nathuni sania mirza ne pahani or jo baad main fishan ban gaya, darasal wo bihar ke gaanv-dehaat kii ladakiyon kii naak main pahani jane vaali 'nathunia' hi he
 In Bihar, 'nathunia' is a symbol of beauty and drunkenness
 isi maadakta or soundarya ne bhojpuri geetkaaron ko sania par geet likhane ko vivash kar diya
 Many songs were written on Sania, not just one song
 bhojpuri film 'jang' main ek gaanaa tab charchaa main aayaa, jab sania ne pakistani cricketer shoeb malik se shaadi or pakistan ko sasuraal chunaa
 The lyrics of the song are still on the tongue of the people, 'sania Mirza Chali Gilli Pakistan Ho
 
 
 'bhojpuri sangeet samasamyik hota he
 Every big and small event is seen in Bhojpuri songs
 ek to sania kii sundarataa, upar se unase judi kahaniyon or vivaad ne kai gane likhwaaye
 But if we believe in the Bhojpuri film industry, Sania is not as popular in Bhojpuri-speaking areas as any superstar heroine of Bhojpuri films
 vinay bihari bataate hai ki agar bhojpuri ilaakon main koi survey ho jaae, to sania ke aage koi abhinetri nahin tik sakati
 He explains the reason for Sania's intoxicating beauty, behind which Bhojpuri film and music industry addict
 rahi-sahi kasar sania kii nathunia or unase judy kahaniyaan or vivaad puure kar dete hai
 According to Vinay Bihari, Sania's pictures in Bhojpuri areas sold so much that it made him think
 bhojpuri bhashi yuvaaon ke kamare main sabase zyada sania kii nathunia vaali tasviren milti hai
 According to Bhojpuri famous singer and actor Anand Mohan Pandey, the texture and beauty of Sania's face gives her the look of 'bihari Bala'
 rahi-sahi kasar naak kii nathuni puri kar detii he, jisase wo puri 'bhojpuria ladki' ban jaati hai, jo har yuvak kii kalpana main hoti he
 According to Anand Mohan Pandey, the beauty of Sania and the nostril on it is similar to the aroma in gold
 anand mohan pehle gayak hai, jinhone sania par pehla gaanaa gaaya tha, wo bhi tab, jab sania kii shoeb se shaadi nahin hui thi
 The lyricist then conceived Sania's wedding to Mahendra Singh Dhoni, for which Lalu Prasad and then Jharkhand Chief Minister Madhu Koda had to take initiative
 us gane ke bol logon ko aaj bhi yaad hai, 'lalu bhaiya batiyaa maan, ban ja agua baat na taal
 
 
 Madhu Koda's Manav Naa, Mahi's Jog Bari Sania Mirza hurriedly married
 
 
 ' ye gaanaa you-tub par maujuud he
 Interestingly, Sania Mirza has not come to Bihar till date, but Bhojpuri has accepted her as her own
 darasal sania mirza kaa bhojpuria luk or bhojpuria soundarya hi wo rishta he, jisane unhen bhojpuri sangeet se itnaa jod diya he ki ve bihar kii bhojpuri geeton kii industry kii ikon ban chuki hai
 As long as she stays in the headlines, Bhojpuri music industry will continue to claim her rights

 ) Shocked by a humiliating defeat at Lord's, the Indian team will descend from their intentions to secure the number one ranking in Test cricket, taking lessons from their mistakes in the second Test against England starting on Friday
 pehla test 196 ran se haarane ke baad bharat kaa manobal gira hua he
 He will now have to perform well to prevent the hosts from occupying the top rankings
 tej gendbaaj jahir khan kii chot or harbhajan singh ke kharaab form ne haalanki bharat kii mushkilen badhaa di he
 Gautam Gambhir's playing in the second Test is doubtful
 iske alaava bharat ke shisharkram ke kuch ballebaaj bhi form main nahin dikhe
 s Sreesanth or Munaf Patel will be given a place if Zaheer stays outside
 bhartiya team teen tej gendbaajon or ek spinner ke saath utarana chaahegi kyonki trent brij kii pich tej gendbaajon kii madadgaar he
 It may be reassuring for the Indian team that it has lost the first Test in five of the seven tours (excluding Bangladesh) in the last four years but has never lost a series except for the 2008 Sri Lanka tour
 pichley saal srilanka main bhi pichhadane ke baad bharat ne vaapasi kii
 This was also seen in their host against South Africa and in the series played there
 iske baavjood is tathy ko andekha nahin kiya ja saktaa ki england ne pichley 17 main se 12 test jite hai or sirf do ganvaaye hai
 The Indian batsmen did not impress at all except for Rahul Dravid's (unbeaten 103) century in the first innings of Lord's Test and the innings of VVS Laxman (56) and Suresh Raina (78) in the second innings
 apane sauven antarrashtriya shatak se ek shatak kii duuri par khadey sachin tendulkar bhi koi yogadan nahin de sake
 Zaheer, who suffered a hamstring injury in the Lord's Test, could not bowl after the first day which increased the burden on Ishant Sharma and Praveen Kumar
 vahiin england team ne andrew strans, elestare cook or eyon morgan ke yogadan ke bina bhartiya gendbaajon ko bouna sabit kar diya
 Meanwhile, Harbhajan's form is also a cause for concern
 lords par unhone 218 ran dekar sirf ek wicket liya
 Before giving Amit Mishra a chance in the next match, the team management will have to be very nervous because this leg-spinner has not played a practice match
 duusari ore england ko atmamugdhata se bachanaa hoga
 All his players appeared in form at Lord's
 kevin petersan ne doharaa shatak jamaaya
 Matt Prior scored a century in the second innings and Stuart Broad also returned to form
 bharat ko test cricket main number van kii ranking se hataane ke liye england ko shrinkhalaa 2-0 yaa 3-1 se jeetni hogi
 The Trent Bridge pitch helps fast bowlers to wreak havoc on James Anderson, Stuart Broad and Chris Tremlett
 teenon shandaar form main chal rahe hai
 Anderson took 11 wickets in the Test against Pakistan here last year
 aise main jabaki bhartiya team shrinkhalaa main bane rahane ke liye sangharsh kar rahi he, sachin tendulkar ke sauve antarrashtriya shatak par se dhyaan hat gaya he
 In such a situation, he can take advantage of this and focus on his hundredth century and the victory of the team

 This step to eradicate black money was both ethical and moral
 neem coted uria kii tarah notebandi par bhi naitikta ko kot chadha hua he
 Pratap Bhanu Mehta has written an article in the Indian Express on this
 jisamen ve naitikta vaali baat par likhte hai ki notebandi ke kadam ke peeche vyaavhaarik vaastaviktaa se bhi zyaada naitikta par ati kii had tak jor diya gaya
 The ethics do not remember that black money has no natural nature of its own
 is baat ko lekar andeh hota he ki notebandi ne paise chhipaane jatil tantron par koi chot pahunchaai ho
 Rather, there is also some evidence that new methods of money laundering have come due to demonetisation
 pratabh bhanu mehta ne yah bhi likhaa he ki paardarshita ke naam par notebandi laai gai, lekin raajnneetik dal apane chande kaa sorce nahin bataanaa chaahate hai
 Citizens are with this transparency, but why political parties do not tell the source of donations
 sarkaar notebandi ke phaayde ko lekar aakraamak he
 Many of its ministers and big leaders are touring different parts of the country, holding press conferences
 ab ham is par kuch nahin kahenge
 Time will be wasted vitt mantri jetali ne bataaya he ki dedh se paune do lakh karod ke lenden ko sandigdh ke daayre main rakhaa jaataa he
 They take great care when calling it suspicious
 yah saavdhaanee akhbaar vaale chhapate vakt nahin baratate hai sidhe likh daalate hai ki dedh lakh karod kii raashi sandigdh
 Whereas after a year, the Finance Minister is saying that it is up to the Income Tax Department and other investigative agencies to evaluate the data and take action

 Surat textile traders are worried about demonetisation and GST
 unhen koi nahin sun rahaa tha
 The situation became such that after thousands of people gathered, they performed and went on their own and went viral with each other to curse the media that Delhi channels do not show their problems
 jiesti council kii baithkon main kuch sanshodhan bhi hue magar usase unhen laabh nahin hua
 Surat's textile trade could not overcome the crisis
 chunaav aa gaya he ki bijepi ke sabhi bade netaa surat ke vyapaariyon kaa haal puch rahe hai
 Amit Shah also went to Surat and Rahul Gandhi too
 rahul gandhi bunakaron ke kaarkaane pahunchakar yarn par jiesti lagaae jane kii samasya ko samajhane kaa prayaas kiya
 In Surat, 30 million meters of cloth are made daily, whereas earlier four and a half million pieces of cloth were made
 hira vyapaaree bhi yahaan sankat main hai
 Their work has also reduced by 30-40 percent
 yahaan 5 se 6 lakh mazaduron se kaam chhin gaya he
 Rahul Gandhi later heard his problems from textile traders
 is vakt bazaar main jo sankat he wo kis had tak notebandi ke kaaran he or kis had tak jiesti ke kaaran kahana mushkil he
 The CMIE, Center for Monitoring Indian Economy, has published a new data on employment
 is saal janvari se april ke bich 15 lakh naukariyaan chali gayi hai
 The number of jobs in the stock market companies has also come down
 107 companiyon main 14,668 naukariyaan kam hui hai
 According to the CMIE, according to the Labor Bureau, between October and December last year 1 lakh 52 thousand casual and 46,000 part time jobs were lost
 wo samay notebandi kaa tha
 Thrissur is a town in Tamil Nadu
 textile sector kaa garh he, balki surat se bhi bada garh he
 We do not have access here, but with the help of a merchant brother, i asked for some pictures
 unase yah kaha ki aaj kii tasviir bhejein
 Indian Express, the English newspaper about Tirupur, is making quite a splash in Business Standard
 main bhi dekhnaa chahta tha ki tirupur kaisaa dikhataa he magar shukr he ki hindi bhashi vyapaaree mahoday ne madad ke liye haa kah di
 Don't want to tell your name, you know what the reasons are
 yah tasviir tirupur ke kadar pet bazaar kii he
 In Tamil, the street is spoken
 yah market stesan se sata hua he
 There is no place to hold sesame seeds in normal days, but you can see this picture of November 8 itself
 sadaken khaali dikh rahi hai
 Tshirts are hung inside the shop but are not purchased
 tirupur main paanch lakh logon ko kaam miltaa he magar notebandi or jiesti ke kaaran ek lakh logon se kaam chhin gaya he
 Dollar City exporters are also in trouble
 under garment ke saare bade brands kii menuphaccharing yaheen hoti hai
 Had there been a benefit of demonetisation and GST, there would have been a festive atmosphere here, but this Diwali has not sold 50 percent of the goods here
 notebandi ke kaaran jo advance par maal diya tha wo abhi tak puraa nahin lautaa he
 Earlier, payment was received from the buyer in a month, now the manufacturer here has to wait for four months
 tasviir bhejne vaale vyapaaree darshak ne bataaya ki aisa sannata to chhuttiyon main hota he, magar chuttee nahin hone par bhi bazaar band jaisaa lag rahaa he
 Few people are calling back the workers who went on Diwali holiday
 yah tasviir jisamen factory kii shater down he, ghaas ugi he, philhal band he
 In Tirupur, 50 percent of the units are closed or running at low capacity, the rest are in crisis
 is unit main aap dekh sakate hai ki kai mashiinon par kaamgaar nahin he
 The picture you are seeing now is of yarn factory which is running and fully automatic, due to which employment has also reduced
 hamen ek vyapaaree ne bataaya ki notebandi or jiesti ke kaaran usne dedh sau kamgaaron ko nikaal diya he
 The rest is not complete work for the two hundred and fifty
 tirupur main kaarobaar 40 fisadi kam ho gaya he
 a businessman told that he had prepared one million pieces for this Diwali but only four lakh pieces could be sold
 chah lakh pis godaam main pade hai, jiske kaaran nae pis kaa production band he
 Among the companies who became manager accountants, they have returned to wages

 Today, Ramdas and his wife are working in their unit and are earning only two thousand instead of 25 in a week
 kya inaki vyathaa kisi press conference main dikhi aapako
 Many people say that if something needs time to recover, should not it have been asked to do something
 yahaan ke vyapaariyon or kamgaaron kaa kya kasoor tha
 Will everything be repaid from the loss of lakhs to crores of rupees, what will be done by the work done by the workers? a businessman from Moradabad said that after demonetisation, many workers started driving e-rickshaws and migrated to Nepal for work
 kinati kahaniyaan hai, jo saamne aane se rah jaati hai jinke bare main kisi press conference main ek shabd nahin he
 Where did the Hours of work go if Demonetisation and GST did wonders
 aisa to nahin tha ki logon ke paas kaushal nahin thi
 The comments pradhanmantri kaushal vikaas yojana ke tahat july 2017 tak 30 lakh 67 hazaar ummidavaaron ko training di gai
 Out of these three lakh people also did not get work, after all where 27 lakh people went with training, what are they doing
 yah aankada bhi kaushal mantralay kaa he jo 8 november ke indian express main chapa he or pehle bhi chap chukaa he
 Is it told in a press conference that we trained 30 lakh people but only three lakh people got employment

 That is why so much is revealed after kicking hands

 The village is just 25 km from Bhopal
 saal bhar pehle is gaanv ko lekar akhabaaron main khub charchaa hui
 The story went on making the headline in TV that this village has become cashless
 aaj us gaanv kii kya haalat he
 Due to network problems, people are not able to fill GST forms, how will we become cashless, why do we forget this question
 is gaanv ko lekar kaaphi tamzam hua tha
 Bank of Baroda has come for adoption
 sabko debit card diya gaya magar zyaadaatar ne istamaal nahin kiya
 Pratab Bhanu Mehta has also written that demonetisation was brought in the name of transparency, but political parties do not want to reveal the source of their donations
 naagarik to is paardarshita ke saath he magar raajnneetik dal kyon nahin chande kaa sorce bataate hai
 The government is aggressive about the benefits of demonetisation
 uske kai mantri or bade netaa desh ke alag alag hisson main daura kar rahe hai, press conference kar rahe hai
 Now we will not say anything on this
 samay barbaad hoga
 Finance Minister Jaitley has told that transactions of one and a half to two and a quarter to two lakh crores are kept under suspicious scope
 ve ise sandigdh kehete samay kaaphi saavdhaanee baratate hai
 The newspapers do not take this caution while printing, directly write that the amount of one and a half lakh crores is doubtful
 jabaki ek saal baad vitt mantri kah rahe hai ki iskar vibhaag or anya jaanch agenciyon par nirbhar karata he ki ve data kaa moolyankan karen or kadam uthaaen
 Some steps have also been taken
 jetali ne yah bhi bataaya ki 22 lakh nae karadaata pichley saal jude the, is saal 6 lakh nae karadaata jude hai

 There were also some amendments in the GST Council meetings but they did not benefit from it

 The election has come that all the big leaders of the BJP are asking the condition of the businessmen of Surat
 amit shah bhi surat gaye or rahul gandhi bhi
 Rahul Gandhi reached the factory of the weavers and tried to understand the problem of imposing GST on yarn
 surat main 3 karod meter kapadaa rose banataa he, jabaki pehle saadhe chaar karod kapadaa banataa tha
 Diamond traders are also in crisis here
 unka bhi kaam 30-40 pratishat kam ho gaya he
 Here 5 to 6 lakh laborers have lost their work
 rahul gandhi ne baad main kapadaa vyapaariyon se unki samasyaayein suni
 The extent of the crisis in the market at this time is due to demonetisation and to what extent GST is difficult to say

 It is adjacent to the market station
 aam dinon main yahaan til dharne kii jagah nahin hoti magar 8 november kii yah tasviir aap khud dekh sakate hai
 Roads are looking empty
 dukaan ke bheetar tishart tange hai magar karidaar nahin hai
 Five lakh people get work in Tirupur but due to demonetisation and GST, work has been lost to one lakh people
 dollar city ke niryaatak bhi sankat main hai
 All the big brands of under-garment manufacturing are here
 notebandi or jiesti kaa laabh hota to yahaan bhi jashn kaa maahaul hota magar is diwali yahaan 50 fisadi maal nahin bika he
 Due to demonetisation, the goods which were delivered at the advance have not yet returned in full
 pehle ek maheene main kharidaar se pement aa jaataa tha, ab yahaan ke manyafacturer ko chaar chaar maheene intazaar karne padate hai
 The businessman who sent the picture told that such silence happens in the holidays, but even if there is no holiday, the market looks like closed
 diwali kii chuttee par gaye mazaduron ko waapas kam hi log bula rahe hai
 This picture, which has a shutter down of the factory, has grown grass, is currently closed
 tirupur main 50 pratishat unit band hai yaa kam kshamta par chal rahi hai, baaki sankat se jujh rahi hai
 In this unit you can see that many machines do not have workers
 ab aap jo tasviir dekh rahe hai wo yarn factory kii he jo chal rahi he or puri tarah se automatic he, iske kaaran bhi rojgaar kam hua he
 We were told by a businessman that he has fired 150 workers due to demonetisation and GST
 baaki jo dhai sau hai unke liye puraa kaam nahin he
 Business in Tirupur has come down by 40 per cent
 ek vyapaaree ne bataaya ki is diwali ke liye das lakh pis taiyaar kar rakhaa tha magar chaar lakh pis hi bik sakaa
 Six lakh pieces are lying in the warehouse, due to which the production of new pieces is stopped
 jo kapaniyon main manager acountint ban gaye the wo waapas mazaduri kii taraf laut gaye hai
 Thousands of laborers have migrated to Bihar, Orissa
 diwali ke baad abhi tak lebar ko bulaane kaa silsilaa shuru nahin hua he
 The hotels here are also empty
 indian express kii story padhiega
 KS Ramdas spent twenty years building a sewing unit, 15 women worked here and KS Ramdas earned 20-25 thousand a week
 aaj apni unit main ramdaas or unki patni hi kaam kar rahe hai or hafte main 25 kii jagah do hazaar hi kama paa rahe hai
 Did you see his agony in a press conference? kai log kehete hai ki kisi chiz ko thik hone main time chahie to kya us chiz ke karne main sabase nahin poocha janaa chahie tha
 What was the fault of the traders and workers here
 kya jab sab thik ho jayega to inke lakhon se lekar karodon ke ghate kii bharpai hogi, kamgaaron se jo kaam chhina uski kya bharpai hogi? muradabad se ek vyapaaree ne bataaya ki notebandi ke baad kai kaamgaar i rickshaw chalaane lage or kaam ke liye nepal kii taraf palaayan kar gaye
 There are many stories, which are kept from coming to the fore, about which there is not a word in any press conference
 kaam ke avaras kahaan gaye agar notebandi or jiesti ne kamaal hi kar diya to
 It was not that people did not have skills
 tippaniyan As of July 2017, under the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana, 30 lakh 67 thousand candidates were trained
 inamen se teen lakh logon ko bhi kaam nahin mila, aakhir 27 lakh log training lekar kahaan gaye, kya kar rahe hai
 This figure is also from the Ministry of Skills, which was published in the Indian Express on November 8 and has been published before
 kya kisi press conference main yah bataaya jaataa he ki hamane 30 lakh logon ko training di magar teen lakh logon ko hi rojgaar mili
 No
 isliye kaaphi haath paanv maarane ke baad itnaa sa pataa chalata he
 Our colleagues Anurad Dwari and Rizwan went to Badjhiri village in Madhya Pradesh
 yah gaanv bhopal se maatr 25 kimi kii duuri par he
 a year ago there was a lot of discussion in the newspapers about this village
 tivi main hedline banaakar story chali ki yah gaanv cashles ho gaya he
 What is the condition of that village today
 network kii pareshaani ke kaaran log jiesti ke form nahin bhar paa rahe hai, cashles kaise ho jaaenge ham yah sawaal kyon bhul jate hai
 There was a lot of frills about this village
 bank of baroda aa gaya god lene ke liye
 Everyone was given a debit card, but most did not use it
 ab ham is par kuch nahin kahenge
 Time will be wasted vitt mantri jetali ne bataaya he ki dedh se paune do lakh karod ke lenden ko sandigdh ke daayre main rakhaa jaataa he
 They take great care when calling it suspicious
 yah saavdhaanee akhbaar vaale chhapate vakt nahin baratate hai sidhe likh daalate hai ki dedh lakh karod kii raashi sandigdh
 Whereas after a year, the Finance Minister is saying that it is up to the Income Tax Department and other investigative agencies to evaluate the data and take action

 Surat textile traders are worried about demonetisation and GST

 The situation became such that after thousands of people gathered, they performed and went on their own and went viral with each other to curse the media that Delhi channels do not show their problems
 jiesti council kii baithkon main kuch sanshodhan bhi hue magar usase unhen laabh nahin hua
 Surat's textile trade could not overcome the crisis
 chunaav aa gaya he ki bijepi ke sabhi bade netaa surat ke vyapaariyon kaa haal puch rahe hai
 Amit Shah also went to Surat and Rahul Gandhi too
 rahul gandhi bunakaron ke kaarkaane pahunchakar yarn par jiesti lagaae jane kii samasya ko samajhane kaa prayaas kiya
 In Surat, 30 million meters of cloth are made daily, whereas earlier four and a half million pieces of cloth were made
 hira vyapaaree bhi yahaan sankat main hai
 Their work has also reduced by 30-40 percent
 yahaan 5 se 6 lakh mazaduron se kaam chhin gaya he
 Rahul Gandhi later heard his problems from textile traders

 The CMIE, Center for Monitoring Indian Economy, has published a new data on employment

 Had there been a benefit of demonetisation and GST, there would have been a festive atmosphere here, but this Diwali has not sold 50 percent of the goods here
 notebandi ke kaaran jo advance par maal diya tha wo abhi tak puraa nahin lautaa he
 Earlier, payment was received from the buyer in a month, now the manufacturer here has to wait for four months

 The rest is not complete work for the two hundred and fifty

 a year ago there was a lot of discussion in the newspapers about this village
 tivi main hedline banaakar story chali ki yah gaanv cashles ho gaya he
 What is the condition of that village today

 There was a lot of frills about this village
 bank of baroda aa gaya god lene ke liye
 Everyone was given a debit card, but most did not use it

 The CMIE, Center for Monitoring Indian Economy, has published a new data on employment
 is saal janvari se april ke bich 15 lakh naukariyaan chali gayi hai
 The number of jobs in the stock market companies has also come down
 107 companiyon main 14,668 naukariyaan kam hui hai
 According to the CMIE, according to the Labor Bureau, between October and December last year 1 lakh 52 thousand casual and 46,000 part time jobs were lost

 main bhi dekhnaa chahta tha ki tirupur kaisaa dikhataa he magar shukr he ki hindi bhashi vyapaaree mahoday ne madad ke liye haa kah di
 Don't want to tell your name, you know what the reasons are
 yah tasviir tirupur ke kadar pet bazaar kii he
 In Tamil, the street is spoken
 yah market stesan se sata hua he
 There is no place to hold sesame seeds in normal days, but you can see this picture of November 8 itself
 sadaken khaali dikh rahi hai
 Tshirts are hung inside the shop but are not purchased
 tirupur main paanch lakh logon ko kaam miltaa he magar notebandi or jiesti ke kaaran ek lakh logon se kaam chhin gaya he
 Dollar City exporters are also in trouble
 under garment ke saare bade brands kii menuphaccharing yaheen hoti hai
 Had there been a benefit of demonetisation and GST, there would have been a festive atmosphere here, but this Diwali has not sold 50 percent of the goods here
 notebandi ke kaaran jo advance par maal diya tha wo abhi tak puraa nahin lautaa he
 Earlier, payment was received from the buyer in a month, now the manufacturer here has to wait for four months
 tasviir bhejne vaale vyapaaree darshak ne bataaya ki aisa sannata to chhuttiyon main hota he, magar chuttee nahin hone par bhi bazaar band jaisaa lag rahaa he
 Few people are calling back the workers who went on Diwali holiday
 yah tasviir jisamen factory kii shater down he, ghaas ugi he, philhal band he
 In Tirupur, 50 percent of the units are closed or running at low capacity, the rest are in crisis
 is unit main aap dekh sakate hai ki kai mashiinon par kaamgaar nahin he
 The picture you are seeing now is of yarn factory which is running and fully automatic, due to which employment has also reduced
 hamen ek vyapaaree ne bataaya ki notebandi or jiesti ke kaaran usne dedh sau kamgaaron ko nikaal diya he
 The rest is not complete work for the two hundred and fifty
 tirupur main kaarobaar 40 fisadi kam ho gaya he
 a businessman told that he had prepared one million pieces for this Diwali but only four lakh pieces could be sold
 chah lakh pis godaam main pade hai, jiske kaaran nae pis kaa production band he
 Among the companies who became manager accountants, they have returned to wages

 Many people say that if something needs time to recover, should not it have been asked to do something
 yahaan ke vyapaariyon or kamgaaron kaa kya kasoor tha
 Will everything be repaid from the loss of lakhs to crores of rupees, what will be done by the work done by the workers? a businessman from Moradabad said that after demonetisation, many workers started driving e-rickshaws and migrated to Nepal for work
 kinati kahaniyaan hai, jo saamne aane se rah jaati hai jinke bare main kisi press conference main ek shabd nahin he
 Where did the Hours of work go if Demonetisation and GST did wonders
 aisa to nahin tha ki logon ke paas kaushal nahin thi
 The comments pradhanmantri kaushal vikaas yojana ke tahat july 2017 tak 30 lakh 67 hazaar ummidavaaron ko training di gai
 Out of these three lakh people also did not get work, after all where 27 lakh people went with training, what are they doing

 Bank of Baroda has come for adoption
 sabko debit card diya gaya magar zyaadaatar ne istamaal nahin kiya
 This picture is from Kadar Peta Bazaar of Tirupur
 tamil main gali ko pet bolte hai
 It is adjacent to the market station
 aam dinon main yahaan til dharne kii jagah nahin hoti magar 8 november kii yah tasviir aap khud dekh sakate hai
 Roads are looking empty
 dukaan ke bheetar tishart tange hai magar karidaar nahin hai
 Five lakh people get work in Tirupur but due to demonetisation and GST, work has been lost to one lakh people
 dollar city ke niryaatak bhi sankat main hai
 All the big brands of under-garment manufacturing are here
 notebandi or jiesti kaa laabh hota to yahaan bhi jashn kaa maahaul hota magar is diwali yahaan 50 fisadi maal nahin bika he
 Due to demonetisation, the goods which were delivered at the advance have not yet returned in full
 pehle ek maheene main kharidaar se pement aa jaataa tha, ab yahaan ke manyafacturer ko chaar chaar maheene intazaar karne padate hai
 The businessman who sent the picture told that such silence happens in the holidays, but even if there is no holiday, the market looks like closed
 diwali kii chuttee par gaye mazaduron ko waapas kam hi log bula rahe hai
 This picture, which has a shutter down of the factory, has grown grass, is currently closed
 tirupur main 50 pratishat unit band hai yaa kam kshamta par chal rahi hai, baaki sankat se jujh rahi hai
 In this unit you can see that many machines do not have workers
 ab aap jo tasviir dekh rahe hai wo yarn factory kii he jo chal rahi he or puri tarah se automatic he, iske kaaran bhi rojgaar kam hua he
 We were told by a businessman that he has fired 150 workers due to demonetisation and GST
 baaki jo dhai sau hai unke liye puraa kaam nahin he
 Business in Tirupur has come down by 40 per cent
 ek vyapaaree ne bataaya ki is diwali ke liye das lakh pis taiyaar kar rakhaa tha magar chaar lakh pis hi bik sakaa
 Six lakh pieces are lying in the warehouse, due to which the production of new pieces is stopped
 jo kapaniyon main manager acountint ban gaye the wo waapas mazaduri kii taraf laut gaye hai
 Thousands of laborers have migrated to Bihar, Orissa
 diwali ke baad abhi tak lebar ko bulaane kaa silsilaa shuru nahin hua he
 The hotels here are also empty
 indian express kii story padhiega
 KS Ramdas spent twenty years building a sewing unit, 15 women worked here and KS Ramdas earned 20-25 thousand a week
 aaj apni unit main ramdaas or unki patni hi kaam kar rahe hai or hafte main 25 kii jagah do hazaar hi kama paa rahe hai
 Did you see his agony in a press conference? kai log kehete hai ki kisi chiz ko thik hone main time chahie to kya us chiz ke karne main sabase nahin poocha janaa chahie tha
 What was the fault of the traders and workers here
 kya jab sab thik ho jayega to inke lakhon se lekar karodon ke ghate kii bharpai hogi, kamgaaron se jo kaam chhina uski kya bharpai hogi? muradabad se ek vyapaaree ne bataaya ki notebandi ke baad kai kaamgaar i rickshaw chalaane lage or kaam ke liye nepal kii taraf palaayan kar gaye
 There are many stories, which are kept from coming to the fore, about which there is not a word in any press conference
 kaam ke avaras kahaan gaye agar notebandi or jiesti ne kamaal hi kar diya to
 It was not that people did not have skills

 14 cities of India were included in the list of most polluted cities released by the World Health Organization (WHO) recently, but even more shocking is that India's pollution level is not meeting the Indian quality standards set by the organization Due to which the age of each person in the country is decreasing by one to two years and in Delhi by six years
 langs care foundation ke adhyaksh va professor dow
 Arvind Kumar said in a conversation with IANS, a few days ago the World Health Organization (WHO) published a study that said India was not meeting the air quality standards set by the Pollution Level Organization of India, due to which Everyone's age is decreasing by at least one to two years and in a polluted city like Delhi by six years
 vahiin agar ham dabluechao ke maanakon ko puraa karte hai to desh main prayek vyakti kii umr chaar se paanch saal tak bad sakati he

 5 levels
 haal hi main america ke barkale arth sanghathan ne ek study kii he, jisamen fefdon or sharir ke anya hisson ko nuksaan pahunchane vaale piem2
 a capacity of 5 was correlated with cigarette smoke, their conclusion being that 22 micrograms of cubit meter PM2
 5 ek cigarette ke baraabar he
 If you come in contact with 22 micrograms for 24 hours, then your body is suffering from a cigarette
 unhone kaha ki agar ham dilli ke ek saal kaa ausat dekhen to yah 140 se 150 microgram cubit meter rahaa, jise bhaag karne par yah chah se saat cigarette banataa he
 That is why we all Delhiites have smoked at least six to seven cigarettes every day, while in winter its number reaches 10 to 40 cigarettes

 He said, the rest of the air purifier is a waste of money, by spending too much money in it, some people get little benefit for a short time
 ek baat yah bhi ki agar aap in air purifaire ke filter ek saal main nahin badalte hai to yah dartifire ho jayega
 The same is also the case with masks, simple masks are just pretensions
 keval ek mask thodaa bahut bachaav karata he vah en95 mask he, lekin ise bhi zyada der tak nahin pahana ja saktaa kyonki yah bahut sakht hota he or ise 10 se 15 minute tak hi lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Yes, if you are coming out of a stinky place then you can use it

 Arvind Kumar said, "for me this is a national emergency, everyone should start intensive efforts immediately and if we postpone it for tomorrow, then we are making our day dangerous
" pradooshan ko rokane ke liye sarkaar dwaara kis tarah ke kadam uthaae jaae ke sawaal par professor arvind ne kaha, sarkaar ko koyale se chalane vaale 500 se zyada urja sanyantron ke utsarjan ko pashchimi deshon ke utsarjan maanakon ke baraabar bananaa chahie or unhen lagu karnaa chahie
 When the government talks about lack of money, it is nothing in front of people's lives

 He said, at the same time the problem of burning of crops is anthropogenic, no matter how strict measures should be taken, even if it has to be resolved on a war footing by involving the army, it should be done for the health of the people
 Otherwise we will have to pay a heavy price
 iskaa andaja noida police ko bhi nahin rahaa hoga ki ek vyapaaree ke apharan kii gutthi sulajhane ke kram main vah apharan karne vaale ek sangathit giroh kaa pardaafash kar degi
 The 12 gang members who have been arrested by the police so far include the engineer, the pilot, the son of a policeman and the son of a schoolteacher rewarded by the state government
 sabase badi baat yah he ki padhe-likhe shaatiron ke is gang kii mukhya sutaradhar ek ladki he
 This girl, who works in the kidnapped businessman's office, used to sit there and provide all the information about his victim to the rest of the gang members

 Had provided the amount of Rs
 And only then could Gupta be freed
 narayan ne bataaya ki police uske baad se hi in shaatir aparaadhiyon kii talash main lagi thi
 On 11 and 12 October, the police achieved great success and within two days 12 gang members were arrested

 4 out of 5 crore ransom paid by the police from the kidnappers' possession
 25 karod ru

 police ne sanket die ki is maamle main abhi or giraftaaryaan ho sakati hai
 During the police interrogation, the accused admitted that the girlfriend of one of his companions, Monu, prepared a complete plan to carry out the kidnapping
 police ko is ladki or monu sahit 4 anya apartaaon kii talash he
 According to sources, the 20-22 year old girl is educated and used to work in Gupta's company
 apharan kii sajeesh banane ke dauraan isi ladki ne apane baaki saathiyon ko gupta ke movement kii pal-pal kii jaankaree muhaiyaa karai or apharan kaa khaakaa taiyaar kiya
 The SSP said that police are investigating the girl's involvement, but she has not revealed her identity at the moment
 sutron ke mutabik, yah ladki gajiabad kii rahane vaali he
 Earlier, in February 2010, Gupta's chartered accountant Saurabh Jain was still kidnapped when the girl played a big role
 police ne giraftaar kiye gaye aropiyon kii pahchaan kapil, anshul babara, sandip kumaar, deepak, vinay kumaar, somvir, anshul putr susheel, pintu urf pushpendra kumaar, sandip, sanjeev, ajay or ish kumaar ke rup main kii he
 While Sanjeev is a resident of Gautam Buddha Nagar district, the remaining 12 accused are from Meerut district
 police ke mutabik, giroh kaa sargana anshul babara padhe-likhe parivaar se he or uske pita mahendra singh babara ko uttar pradesh sarkaar ne 2009 main rajya shikshak puraskaar se nawaja tha
 Another accused Vinay Kumar hails from Dabthua village in Meerut and is a pilot by profession
 police ne isi ke ghar se phiroti kii rakam kaa ek hissaa baraamad kiya tha
 a police officer said that the gang also included the son of a police head constable
 yah ladkaa police kii gatividhiyon ke bare main giroh ko jaankaree muhaiyaa karaane main ahm bhoomika nibhaa rahaa tha
 Apart from this, many of the accused arrested are b
tech
 haalanki police ne abhi inkaa puraa byoraa saarvajanik nahin kiya he
 He claims that the members of this gang have been involved in car theft and petty criminal incidents before and they have also been involved in kidnapping
 apharan kaa byoraa dete hue esaspi ne kaha, ''apaherta gupta ko agava karke greater noida le gaye or unhen vahaan ek makaan main rakhaa gaya
 We are also investigating the claims that the hijackers were getting information about the activities of the police
 ham yah bhi pataa lagane kii koshish kar rahe hai, ki kahin yah vahi giroh to nahin he jisane farvari 2010 main gupta ke chartered accountint saurabh jain ko agava kiya tha
 '' Jain also received Rs 25 lakh at that time
 kii phiroti dene ke baad chhudaaya ja sakaa tha
 Despite apprehending a large number of accused, the police is not disclosing which house in Greater Noida was hijacked and whose house it is
 samaj ja rahaa he ki yah makaan greater noida ke kisi netaa se judaa hua he or isiilie police khulaasa karne main ehtiyaat barat rahi he
 On getting any clue about this girl or the question of other arrests, Narayan said, "the police is busy in the search
" bahut jald maamle main kuch or giraftaaryaan or khulaase honge
 '' 5 crore given as a ransom anyway
 kii rakam main se 75 lakh ru
 They are still out of the grip of police
 aise main ummid kii ja sakati he ki is kathith sargana ladki kii giraftaar ke baad desh main punap rahe hytech apaherta giroh kii nai paraten saamne aaengi or yah bhi pataa chalegaa ki vah kaise is khatarnaak aparaadh main shaamil hui
 But a question will still remain in place that what kind of training it is that makes the pilots and engineers also kidnappers

 Devendra Fadnavis openly said when he went with Ajit Pawar, Sharad Pawar's confidence was given: Fadnavis, not us, Shiv Sena has broken alliance: Former Maharashtra CM Many political upsurge was seen after assembly elections in Maharashtra
 devendra fadanvis ne naatakeey andaaj main subah-subah mukhyamantri pad kii shapath lee lekin 80 ghante main hi istipha de diya
 After all what happened then, Devendra Fadnavis talked to Aaj Tak
 maharashtra ke purv mukhyamantri ne bataaya ki ajit pavaar ne unase kaha he ki sharad pavaar se unki baat ho gai he, tabhi vah samarthan dene ke liye taiyaar hai
 Read what Devendra Fadnavis said on the issue of Maharashtra politics
 
 
 sawaal: ajit pavaar kaa samarthan kyon liya?devendra fadanvis:aapako isaki puri jaankaree leni hogi, kyonki tab ajit pavaar ne kaha tha ki unhone sharad pavaar se baat kar lee he
 He had been talking about this for a long time, when he spoke of support, he went and handed over the letter to the Governor
 kyonki kaaphi technical dikkatein thim, isliye shapath jaldi ho gai
 Devendra Fadnavis said that i also spoke to NCP mlas and he said that Sharad Pawar is aware of this alliance
 sawaal: kya piem modi ne sharad pavaar ko cabinet vaala ofer diya?devendra fadanvis:sharad pavaar puri baat nahin bataa rahe hai, piem or pavaar ke bich kaaphi baaten hui thim jo piem modi sahi vakt par bataaenge
 Sharad Pawar is telling only what was in his favor
 hamane tab sarkaar isliye banaai kyonki number the, lekin sabhi ko pataa he ki ensipi vahi karti he jo nahin kahati he
 Question: Constantly opposed to Ajit, then why formed the government with NCP? Devendra Fadnavis: He also had problems in alliance with NCP, both have opposed each other
 lekin jab aapako kisi ne dhokhaa diya ho to aapako raajnneeti main active rahanaa padataa he
 But what NCP has done now by forming a government with Shiv sena-congress is not in our option
 devendra fandwis ne ye bhi kaha ki ajit pavaar ko jo ACB ne clin chit di he, uski jaankaree unhen nahin he
 He is against this clean chit
 sabhi ko pataa he ki wo ek ghotaalaa tha
 Question: Will relations with Shiv Sena improve? Devendra Fadnavis: This government is the auto rickshaw government, which itself will fall from the burden
 hamane koi oparation lotus nahin chalaaya, shivasena ne hi dhokhaa diya
 It never happened that Uddhav Thackeray had tried to talk to him and he refused

 a leader close to Yadav said, he (kejriwal) is unwilling to bow down and is demanding Bhushan and Yadav's resignation
 yahaan tak ki ramdaas ne hastkshep kaa prayaas kiya, lekin isse koi samaadhaan nahin niklaa
 Those supporting Bhushan and Yadav say that the two leaders will not bow down to Kejriwal's demands

 ) bollywood actor akshay kumaar pichley kuch dinon se apni naagarikta ko lekar vivaadon main hai
 Akshay Kumar, a non-political interviewee of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the founder of India's Heroic Applications Idea, is accusing him of cashing in on the sentiments of Indians
 akshay, deshbhakti vaali filmein karte hai, modi kaa intervyuu lete hai, lekin unke paas bharat kii naagarikta hi nahin he
 In this case, Rohit Shetty has now defended Akshay
 suryavanshi ke nirdesan rohit shetty ne kaha, "akshay kumaar, akshay kumaar hi rahegaa, ye sirf do teen din kii baat he
 And it is working
 sirf bharat ke vir hi nahin or bhi bahut kuch karte rahete hai
 They just have a habit that they do not do publicity
 to ye do din ke baad khatm ho jayega
 "rohit Shetty also said," i am also here, you are also here, after 48 hours you call me
 48 ghanton ke baad yahi twitor, yahi fasebuk par koi bakra ban chukaa hoga, kuch nayaa shuru hoga
 Every man is proving himself wrong on social media to show himself right
 usase kuch fark nahin padataa
 "what is the new controversy about Akshay's citizenship? Actually, during the fourth phase of voting in Lok Sabha elections, all the stars came to Mumbai to vote, but Akshay Kumar did not show up
 iske baad ek reporter ne akshay kii naagarikta ko lekar sawaal kiya
 The actor did not respond
 is bich soshal media main log akshay kumaar kii naagarikta par sawaal karne lage
 Later, Akshay Kumar issued a statement stating that he has a Canadian passport
 lekin wo saat saal se canada nahin gaye hai
 Akshay Kumar has been supported by many Bollywood celebs in the citizenship dispute
 anupam ne bhi kiya tha saport-rohit shetty se pehle anupam kher ne bhi akshay kaa saport karte hue kaha tha ki dear akshay kumaar! maine kai jagah padhaa ki aapako desh ke prati apni vafadari ko kai logon ke saamne siddh karnaa pad rahaa he
 Close this! It is the job of these people to make people who like you and me talk about the country defensive
 aap karm karne main yakeen karte hai

 jasprit bumraah
 
 
 The name itself is enough to bring fear to any batsman
 ji haa, bharat ke pes atake ke leader bumraah ne jis tezi ke saath puri duniya main apni dhak jamaai he, wo bemisaal he
 The evidence of how deadly Test cricket Bumrah has been is his 62 wickets in just 12 Tests
 ye apane aap main bataata he ki kisi bhi batsman ko bowling par saamne bumraah ko dekhnaa kyon dehshat main daal detaa he?bumraah ko test cricket main aagaaz kaa mauka 2018 ke shuru main diya gaya
 With every match for Right Orm, Unorthodox Boller Bumrah, his fans are growing in number in the country and abroad
 ipel main bumraah ke saath kaam kar chuke shen bond or riki ponting ne pehle hi bhavishyavaanee kar di thi ki wo test main bahut kaamyaab rahenge
 Irfan Pathan, who was also India's 'swing sensation' during his time, believes that the exposure of Test cricket made Bumrah more sharper
 saath hi bade muqablon ke liye taiyaar bhi
 Says Irfan, 'bumrah developed an outgoing swinger while playing international cricket
 ab unki is par puri cmand dikhti he, ye test cricket kii badaulat hua
 When you play Test cricket, you face the challenge of bowling in different circumstances
 nai gend ke saath, duusare seshan main puraani gend ke saath or final seshan main phir alag gendon ke saath
 "irfan told India Today," There are at least three to four spellings a day
 isi sab se aap apane bare main bahut kuch sikhte hai
 Yes, you have coaches to guide you, but as a bowler you have to use your mind yourself
 yahi he wo baat
 Bumrah has recently achieved excellent control over the swing
 batsman ke liye unke quick arm ection ko padhanaa mushkil hota he
 The way he removes the out-swinger from the short run up, any batsman can have trouble in playing it
 bumraah apane is hathiyaar kaa ab zyada se zyada istemaal karne lage hai
 It brought him much success in the West Indies
 irfan kehete hai ki bumraah ne pichley kuch samay se apane main kaaphi sudhaar kiya he
 According to Irfan, "when Bumrah started playing international cricket, he used to fall slightly to the left, completing his bowling run up
 ab wo sidhe rahete hai isliye unka puraa balance rahata he
 Bumrah now manages to move the ball on both sides
 isse unhen kaaphi majbootee mili he
 Despite all this, it is a good thing that Bumrah's natural bowling action remains the same
 jab aap apane ection ko baar-baar ripet karte hai to aap apni art ke master ban jate hai
 "anil Kumble has described in Bumrah the ability to become the greatest fast bowler of the country
" vahiin ol time batting great vivian richards kaa kahana he ki agar unhen phase karne ke liye kaha jaataa to wo bumraah kii jagah denis lily ko khelnaa adhik pasand karte
 This in itself is a very big supplement for Bumrah
 bumraah ke skills ke sabhi exparts kaayal najar aate hai
 According to Irfan, "bumrah has made India's bowling attack far better
 ab wo duniya ke best bowlar hai, chaahe ranking aisa kahe yaa naa kahe
 Be it the new ball or the old, white or red, Bumrah retains his edge all along
 ham bahut kismat vaale hai ki bumraah jaisaa bowlar hamaare paas he

 It reached such an extent that angry BJP workers vandalized the office of Municipality Auditorium leader Srinath Bhimale
 aapako bataa den ki pune mahanagar palika ke itihaas main pehali baar bijepi party ko puraa bahumat hasil hua he
 With the BJP party having 97 corporators in the municipality, the BJP party can appoint three out of five approved members

 The BJP office in Pune municipality was crowded to submit its request
 bijepi yuva morcha ke adhyaksh ganesh ghosh ko mukhya daavedaar mana ja rahaa tha
 However, Ganesh Bidkar was named instead of Ganesh Ghosh's name at the last moment
 ganesh bidkar ke alaava gopal chintal or raghunatha gauda ko bhi ummidavaar banaaya gaya
 In fact, Ganesh Bidkar, whose name was being discussed in the party, was named in the list of three candidates
 ye dekhakar ganesh ghosh nebijepike karyaalay main ghuskar hangaamaa khadaa kar diya
 During the uproar, the office was also vandalized, in which the glass of the table was broken

 Anna Hazare, after breaking the silence, lashed out at the central government and said that the government was bent on weakening it instead of bringing a strong Lokpal bill
 anna ne media se jo kuch kaha, dekhie uski ek jhalak:-majboot lokapal ke gathan tak unka andolan jari rahegaa
 - What his team did in Hisar was just a warning that the party which would not bring a strong Lokpal, would appeal to the people to vote against it
 -agar sansad ke sheetakaaleen satr main sarkaar majboot lokapal bill paas nahin karti he, ve aagaamee vidhansabha chunaavon main party vishesh ke khilaaf abhiyaan chalaayenge or logon se us party ko vot na dene kii apil karenge
 The government will be requested to form a strong Lokpal at the Center on the lines of the Lok Sabha bill of Uttarakhand
 -jis tareeke se uttarakhand main bill paas kiya gaya, vah kaabile tarif he
 - The intention of the Central Government is not clear, that is why it is dividing the Lokpal Bill in pieces
 -jab lokapal bill main citijan charter kaa zikr pehle se hi he, to ise agal se laane kii kya jarurat he
 -the intention of the government is flawed
 -bhrashtachariyon ke khilaaf shikaayat karne vaale goliyon ke shikaar ban rahe hai
 - The picture will change in Uttarakhand in the coming 4-5 months
 pradesh main garibon ko nyaay milane lagegaa
 - The whole matter will be put before the Parliament Standing on Lokpal Bill
 meraa maunvrat kisi vyakti yaa party ke khilaaf nahin tha
 - After a 12-day hunger strike at Ramlila Maidan, my health became weak, therefore, i had no other option but to 'silence' as told by Mahatma Gandhi
 -agar aisi sthiti aati he, to aapako maun rahanaa chahie
 - My condition has improved after the moon
 raktchaap or vajan saamaanya he
 - We have to fight for Lokpal and against corruption
 -ladaai ke liye maine nai shakti hasil kar lee he
 i am ready for battle
 loksabhaa main mangalvaar ko chali lambii bahes ke baad lokapal bill paas ho gaya he
 The bill has passed with some amendments, which are as follows - 1
 pradhanmantri ke khilaaf jaanch ke liye teen−chauthai kii bajaay ab do−tihaai bahumat jaruri
 2
 bhrashtachar kaa maamla sabit hone se pehle saansad yaa vidhayak kii sampatti jabt hone jaisi karrwai nahin
 3
 lokayukta niyukt karne yaa na karne kaa faisla rajya khud karenge
 4

 Vasudev Acharya of the Left kept an amendment to bring corporates under the purview of Lokpal, but fell through
 lekin sarkaar ke kai sanshodhan paas ho gaye
 After voting in Lok Sabha, when the turn of voting came, Bahujan Samaj Party and Samajwadi Party mps walked out of the House
 iske baad vipaksh ke saare sanshodhan girte gaye
 The government has won one round of the Lokpal battle, but this victory is considered incomplete at the moment, because the government will have a tough test on this bill in Rajya Sabha

 On the second day, 'priya Ke Bol' session on the 'halla Bol' stage of 'sahitya Aaj Tak', writing the poems of young people who communicate in their tongues and 'I am looking for 1999 in 1999'
 The raging actress Kavitri and model Priya Malik spoke in their own style
 is seshan kaa sanchaalan ajtak kii dipti editor neha batham ne kiya
 Priya said i came from Mumbai a week ago
 dilli kii jahrili hawa par baat karte hue unhone kaha ki yahaan aakar meraa galaa kharaab ho gaya he
 i saw people wearing masks, children with masks
 mujhe lagata he ki mujhe is par bhi koi kavita likhni padegi
 Priya further said that i like Delhi very much
 main dehradun main pali-badi hum lekin dilli main main badi hui hum
 In three years, i fell in love with Delhi, which is now more than Dehradun
 priya malik ne kaha meraa galaa kharaab he lekin phir bhi main aapke liye parform karuungi
 i always wanted attention
 main bachapan main bahut atarangi hua karti thi
 i was the first to fall in love at the age of 12-13
 wo sabase zyada pyor hota he
 When that happened, i started writing poetry
 us vakt titanic film ai thi
 It had the song i Heart Will Go On
 
 
 wo gaanaa maine apni diary main likhaa tha us vajah se meri maa ne mujhe bahut peeta tha
 After that i wrote a poem for my mother too
 sahitya ajtak kii puri kawarej dekhne ke liye yahaan clic karen
 
 
 Priya Malik while talking about her early days in Mumbai said that i used to live in a studio apartment
 vahaan jagah kam thi lekin pyaar bahut zyada tha
 i wrote the story there in my poem
 vah kavita bhi priya ne sahitya ajtak ke manch se sunai
 During this time, the people present in the audience gallery kept listening to his poetry in peace
 kavita ke ant main logon ne jamkar taaliyaan bajaain
 Every morning, when a small piece of sunlight is sitting in the corner in my room, like your faces, when Asmaan also starts changing his sides, there is a group chat of whatsapp, in which many residents are intruding in the whole morning, all day, all night

 Today, even after 11 years, the excitement of meeting him again was as low as the sorrow of separation from him
 naa main roi thi naa vah chillaaya tha
 We both saw our relationship dying in front of our eyes and did not even think to cremate their relationship with rituals
 aaj itane saal biit jane ke baad bhi kuch mahasoos nahin ho rahaa tha to main vakt se pehle hi coffee shop main jaakar baith gai or vahaan kaa muyna karne lagi
 
 
 "after this Priya Malik told another story of hers

 'sanju'film kaa khalanaayak koun he
 
 
 The According to Raju Hirani, the press, which according to sources or by putting a question mark, presents rumors as news
 media se is shikaayat ko film main itani ahmiyat di gai he ki film kaa ant baqayada ek gane se hota he,jisamen media kaa mazaaq banaaya gaya he
 It is true that the media has been acting irresponsibly many times
 vah kai baar apni taaqat ke nakli gumaan main rahata he
 Sometimes other powerful people are also helpful in maintaining this illusion
 kai baar yah lagata he ki in taqatvar logon ko eemaandaar nahin,ek beyimaan media hi chahie,samajhadaar nahin,sansani vaala media hi chahie
 Sanjay Dutt's complaints from this media will also be valid, but they are incomplete complaints
 sach to yah he ki puraa kaa puraa manoranjan udyog - jisamen hindi filmein or uske nayak-nayikaayen bhi shaamil hai - media ke is sansani vaale tatv kaa sabase zyaada istemaal karata he
 He also promotes her
 use apane anyathaa jaadoovihin nayakon kaa jaadu paidaa karne ke liye is media kii madad chahie
 She needs the help of this media to show the glamor of her heroines
 media uske khel main saajheedaar rahata he
 He also helps in promotion of his bad films
 sankat tab paidaa hota he,jab yah media yah khel apane dhang se karne lagata he
 It is not uncharacteristic that actors who never run after the media during their struggle - get irritated by the media the most after their star
 yah amitabh bachchan se lekar sanjay dutt tak kaa andaaz rahaa he
 But this is not a case of hide-and-seeker game between the media and the stars
 abhinayta abhinay dutt kii'byopic'hone kaa daawa karne vaali film'sanju'darasal apni suvidha se kai tathy chunati he or kai nazarandaaz kar detii he
 No one has the right to object to this too
 kisi shaks ko yah haq he ki vah apni zindagi ke jin hisson ko logon ke saamne rakhana chaahe,unhen rakhe or baaqi ko chipa le
 But for a good cinema as a medium, the crisis starts from here
 jab aap bahut saavdhaan qadamon se zindagiyon kii kataai-chantai shuru karte hai,to ve bejaan ho jaati hai - unka vah spandan jaataa rahata he,jo unki vidmbanaaen bhi banaata he or vilakshantaayen bhi
 The same has happened with Sanjay Dutt's film
 is film ke sabase achche hisse ve hai,jab vah drugs se jujhataa dikhaai padataa he,kyonki yahaan vah vaaki us yatharth se muthbhed kar rahaa he,jo usne jiya he
 But where the story of the Babri Masjid and the subsequent riots begins, where the matter of Sanju possessing weapons, getting caught and released in TADA Act, and going to jail and cutting jail, the film is somewhat macro, some dramatic and sometimes Some also become fake
 iske baad apni samagrata main yah film baap-bete ke bhavuk rishte kii kahani ho jaati he - bete kii takaleef pita ke seene main chubhti he,bete kaa ankaha prem pita ke saamne ankaha rah jaataa he
 All this has resulted in the fact that this film, which broke the record of earning due to interest in the life of Sanjay Dutt, has proved to be the strongest movie of Raju Hirani's career
 'munna bhai embibies', 'lage raho munnabhai', 'thri idiyats'yaa'pike'ke mukaable'sanju'kahin nahin tikti
 The trouble is that Raju Hirani, who has been looking for a villain in the weakest parts of 'sanju', finds the media the easiest victim - forgetting that Bollywood does not lose its share in the sports that the media does
 duusari baat yah ki jaise'sanju'ke bare main raju hiraani ne manachaahe tathy chune hai,vaise hi media ke bare main bhi chun liye hai
 While the truth is that when the media does sports, it is safe, when it reports, it is in danger
 yah anayas nahin he ki'sanju'ke release hone se kuch hi din pehle jammu-kashmir main ek patrkaar ko aatankiyon ne goli maar di or yah tippanee likhe jane se kuch pehle maharashtra police ek patrkaar ko khoj rahi he,jisane ek kaarykram ke liye press club kii booking kii thi
 This is actually Raju Hirani's biggest failure - seeing 'sanju' does not form a complete opinion about Sanjay Dutt nor a true opinion about the media

 madhya pradesh (madhay Pradesh) ke mukhyamantri kamalnath (kamal Nath) ke janmdin par madhya pradesh congress cameti (MPCC) kii taraf se ajeeb sa vigyaapan chapa gaya he
 It is difficult to decide whether a greeting is being given or tightened by reading the advertisement printed in all the newspapers
 vigyaapan main kamalnath ke bare main kuch khaas baaten bataai gai hai
 For example, in 1993, there was talk of Kamal Nath becoming the Chief Minister
 bataaya jaataa he ki tab arjuna singh ne digvijay singh kaa naam aage kar diya
 In this way, Kamal Nath missed becoming CM at that time
 ab 25 saal baad digvijay ke samarthan ke baad unhen mukhyamantri banane kaa mauka mila
 What kind of wishes? @ INCMP @ officeofknath @ ndtvindiapic

 The court sent Sanjay Gandhi to Tihar Jail in a case during the Janata Party government after the Emergency
 tab indira sanjay kii suraksha ko lekar chintit thim
 It is said that Kamal Nath then deliberately fought with a judge and the judge sent him to Tihar for seven days

 bijepi ko congress se maze lene kaa mauka mil gaya he
 However, Congress leader Kantilal Bhuria said that this is the conspiracy of the Bharatiya Janata Party
 paisa dekar wo hi chhapavate hai
 On the other hand, Madhya Pradesh Congress Secretary Chandraprabhash Shekhar said that we have not given any official advertisement on behalf of the State Congress Committee
 ham pataa lagaayenge ki wo vigyaapan kaise auki kahaan chap gaya
 BJP spokesperson Rajneesh Aggarwal said that the state Congress wishes by writing such controversial and insulting things about its own leader and Chief Minister
 shame aani chaiye
 On the occasion of Kamal Nath's birthday, the kind of politics he has done with his own leader should be ashamed
 isamen kisi sibiai jaanch kii zarurat nahin

 The monsoon is going to knock in Delhi, but before that, politics has also started to clean the drains

 Manoj Tiwari said that he should return to the national capital, as the PWD department of Delhi Government has not completed the cleaning of drains anywhere so far
 to monsoon shuru hone se pehle naalon se gaad nikaalane kaa kaam thik tarah se karavaaya jaae
 Meaning if there is a heavy rain in Delhi, this time many places will have to face the problem of water logging
 aise main dilli sarkaar kaa is ore turant dhyaan dena bahut jaruri he, taaki naalon kii saafai hon or logon ko jalairao kii samasya kaa saamana kaa nahin karnaa pade
 He has further written that he too has asked the three municipal corporations to clean their drains but the problem is that the small drains of the MCD fall into the drains of the PWD department of the Delhi government
 agar emsidi apane naalon kii safai bhi kar le tab bhi samasya jas kii tas bani rahegi
 Therefore, it is important to pay attention to this
 uske alaava manoj tiwari ne siem kejariwal ko ye bhi kaha ki dilli ke log iske alaava pani, bijli or pradooshan jaisi samasyaon se bhi jujh rahe hai isliye is par bhi dhyaan dena jaruri he

 Katie says, 'erin is just my Erin to me
 vah hamesh mujhe purush kii tarah lagata tha
 But now they have undergone the operation, so now they are more confident and comfortable in themselves
 'ab donon ek saath duusare couples kii tarah swimming, boating or sanbath ke liye jate hai
