 AITA argues that the sourness in the relationship between the players is the truth of the professional sports world, but when it comes to the country, the Sangh takes the decision that is absolutely right
 khanna ne kaha, "jab desh kii baat aati he to phir sab rishte saamaanya ho jate hai
 " bhupati ne haal hi main kaha tha ki vah landan main rohan ke saath jodi bananaa chaahate hai

 The issue of triple talaq is going on in the Supreme Court for the second day
 salmaan khurshid islam main nikaah, meher or talaak ko lekar apni daleel de rahe hai
 On this, Justice Rohington Nariman asked him that do you want to tell the difference between theory and practicality in the system of marriage and divorce in Islam? Do you want the Supreme Court to implement the system that is in Islam? Salman Khurshid said yes
 lekin court ko is maamle main koi kanoon nahin bananaa chahie balki islam main jo behatar tarika bataaya gaya he, use bataanaa chahie
 When a divorce is called for the third time, it cannot be returned, but it takes 3 months
 nijee taur par court kii madad kar rahe purv kanoon mantri or congressi netaa salmaan khurshid ne kaha ki meri nijee raay main tripal talaak paap he
 AIMPLB stands that triple divorce is disgusting but still valid
 justise courion joseph ne poocha-kya jo dharm ke mutabik hi ghinauna he wo kanoon ke tahat vaid tehraaya ja saktaa he? supreme court ne poocha ki jo paap he kya use shariat main liya ja saktaa he? On this, Salman Khurshid said that it cannot be held even if it is constitutionally valid
 log ye kahkar ki is paap ko ishwar se liya he, kanoon bana sakate hai ? agar tripal talaak ko 1 talaak kar diya jaae to 90 fisadi dikkatein ek baar main dur ho jaaengi
 The husband and wife should be given a chance to reconcile during the three-month iddat
 supreme court ne poocha ki agar bharat main tripal talaak vishisht he to duusare deshon ne kanoon banaakar tripal talaak ko khatm kar diya? khurshid ne kaha ki isi tarah kii dikkatein ain hogi to un deshon ko laga hoga ki ise khatm kar dena chahie
 CJI said on Mehr's talk - ki is par sunwaayee kii philhal jarurat nahin - If the triple divorce ends, then the results will be decided later
 - yahaan mudda ye nahin he ki kuch log baithkar faisla karne kii koshish kar rahe hai or faisla nahin hota to wo alag baat he
 - But here at the same time, a person takes a decision
 salmaan khurshid ne kaha - Terms are written in the Nikahnama which makes it difficult to divorce justise courion ne poocha - Should it be written in the nikahnama that triple divorce will not happen? The debate was completed by Khurshid
 justise rohington ne kaha - Triple divorce is the worst and undesirable way to end marriage in Islam - haalanki tripal talaak ko islam ke vibhinn skool aaf thats main vaid mana gaya he
 The comments varisht vakil ram jethmalani ne kaha - Triple divorce is disgusting because these women do not get equal rights in divorce
 CJI khehar ne kaha ki - Triple divorce is a tradition or part of Sharia - bharat ke alaava kahaan ye lagu he - Many people consider the death penalty in the country to be a sin, but it is valid by law

 is par salmaan khurshid ne kaha ki nahin tehraaya ja saktaa chaahe wo sanvaidhanik taur par vaid ho to bhi
 People can make laws by saying that they have taken this sin from God? If triple talaq is made 1 divorce then 90% problems will be resolved at once
 teen maheene ke iddatkaal main pati-patni ko sulah kaa mauka diya chahie
 The Supreme Court asked that if triple divorce is specific in India, then other countries enacted a law and abolished triple divorce? Khurshid said that if there were similar problems, then those countries would have thought that it should be abolished
 meher kii baat par CJI ne kaha - That there is no need to hear at this time - agar tripal talaak khatm hoga to uske parinaamon par baad main faisla lenge
 - The issue here is not that some people are sitting and trying to decide and if the decision is not made then it is a different matter
 - lekin yahaan to ek hi vakt par ek shaks chaahe jahaan faisla le letaa he
 Salman Khurshid said - nikaahnaame main sharten likhi rahati hai jisase talaak dena mushkil ho jaataa he Justice Curian asked - kya nikaahnaame main likhaa janaa chahie ki tripal talaak nahin hoga? khurshid kii ore se bahes puri hui

 Antony said that last year we spent 100 percent of the defense procurement budget
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki vah raksha sauda prakriya tantra ko durust karne par bhi vichaar kar rahe hai
 Leader of the Opposition Arun Jaitley, seeking clarification from the Defense Minister, said that the cases of the Army and the Ministry of Defense which have been coming up for some time, are disturbing
 unhone kaha ki in maamalon ko band daravaajon ke peeche hi sulajhaa liya janaa chahie tha
 He said that it seems that the government has turned a blind eye to many cases
 jetali ne kaha ki jab sainya pramukh ko yah maaloom tha to unhone karrwai kyon nahin kii
 bjp's SS Ahluwalia wanted to know from the government what is the scope of investigation in the orders given by the CBI probe in this case

 Taking a dig at the central government, Sonia said that it is not hidden from anyone in the country that the Modi government at the center has seen the RTI institution as a major hurdle in implementing its autocratic agenda
 unhone aage yah bhi kaha ki yah kanoon javabdehi maangata he or bhaajapa sarkaar kisi bhi tarah ke jawaab dene se saaf-saaf gurej karti ai he
 Sonia praised RTI, Sonia Gandhi said in her statement, "one of the most glorious achievements of the Congress-led UPA government was the enactment of the 'right to Information Act' in 2005
 is aitihaasik kanoon ne soochna ayog jaisi sanstha ko janm diya, jisane pichley 13 saalon main prajatantr ke myne badalakar shashan va prashasan main paardarshita laane tathaa sarkaron kii aam janata ke prati javabdehi sunishchit karne kaa kaam kiya
 upa's RTI Act was recognized as one of the best public relations laws in the world
 "bataayin artiai kii uplabdhiyanunhone aage kaha, "artiai kanoon ne sarkaar evam nagarikon ke bich uttardaayitv va jimmedaari kaa sidhaa sambandh sthapit kiya tathaa bhrashtachari aacharan par nirnaayak prahaar bhi kiya
 RTI activists from across the country used this law effectively to eradicate corruption, assess the effectiveness of government policies and highlight the shortcomings of procedures like demonetisation and elections
 "modi sarkaar par lagaaya aropamodi sarkaar par hamalaa bolte hue sonia ne kaha, "desh main yah baat kisi se chhipi nahin ki centre kii modi sarkaar artiai kii sanstha ko apane nirankush agenda ko lagu karne main ek badi aadchan ke taur par dekhati ai he
 This law demands accountability and the BJP government has been clearly shying away from giving any kind of reply
 isiilie bhaajapa sarkaar ke pehle kaarykaal main ek agenda ke tahat centre va rajyon main badi sankhya main soochna ayuktaon ke pad rikt pade rahe
 Even the post of Central Chief Information Commissioner remained vacant for ten months
 yah sab kar modi sarkaar kaa lakshya keval artiai kanoon ko prabhaavaheen evam dantavihin karnaa tha
 "accused of weakening RTI imposed", Sonia further said, "the BJP government has now taken a decisive attack on the RTI Act
 is kanoon kii prabhaavashiltaa ko or kamjor karne ke liye modi sarkaar ne aise sanshodhan paarit kiye hai, jo soochna ayuktaon kii shaktiyon ko sansthagat tareeke se kamjor karke unhen sarkaar kii anukanpa ke adheen kar denge
 The goal is clear - information commissioners cannot act as government officials to ensure accountability of the government
 "ghataae gaye soochna ayuktaon ke kaarykaal: soniounhone aage kaha, "soochna ayuktaon ke pad kaa kaarykaal centre sarkaar ke nirnay ke adheen karte hue paanch se ghataakar teen saal kar diya gaya he
 Under the 2005 law, his tenure was fixed for a full five years, so that he would be completely free from the interference and pressure of government and administration
 lekin sanshodhit kanoon main puri tarah unki swaittata kii bali de di gai he
 Any information officer issuing information against the government can now be immediately removed or dismissed from office
 isse centre va rajya ke sabhi soochna ayuktaon kaa apane kartavya kaa nirvahan karne tathaa sarkaar ko javabdeh banane kaa utsaah thanda pad jayega
 "information Commissioners Will Not Avoid Government Intervention: Sonia Continuing her case, Sonia further said," The second amendment is - the rules of salary, allowances and conditions of Central Information Commissioners, which were equal to those of Election Commissioners
 ab centre sarkaar dwaara nae sire se tay kiye jaaenge
 In other words, their salary and allowances will be reduced as per the wish of the Modi government
 in mahatvapurn padon ke kaarykaal va bhatton ko kam karne kaa adhikaar apane haath main lekar modi sarkaar ne sunishchit kar diya he ki koi bhi varisht swabhimani adhikari is tarah ke tanaavpurn va nigaraanee bhare vaataavaran main kaam karnaa sweekaar hi nahin karegaa
 After these amendments, no information commissioner will be able to escape the intervention and instructions of the Modi government
 "hogi sarkaar ke chahete adhikariyon kii niyukti: soniounhone aage kaha, "iske dwaara modi sarkaar apane ishaaron par kaam karne vaale adhikariyon ko jab tak chaahe, jaise chaahe niyukt kar sakegi
 They will work for the flattery of the government in compulsion and will take silence on the questions which the government does not want to answer
 hamane sansad main in sanshodhano kaa virodh kiya he or aage bhi inke khilaaf ladate rahenge
 We strongly condemn this scheming attack on our democratic institutions and will continue to oppose the decisions of the BJP government and the autocratic and dictatorial activities being taken against the welfare of the country

 Big level gimmick is now happening in Bigg Boss house
 somvaar ko big bos 7 ke ek pratibhaagi armaan kohli ko police ne giraftaar kiya
 Kohli was accused of assault by Sophia Hayat
 agle hi din armaan ko jamaanat mil gai
 But when he left the police station, he was showered with rotten tomatoes
 16 disambar 2013 kii raat 10 baje big bos ke ghar main jo hua, usne sabhi pratibhaagiyon ko chaunkaa diya
 On this day also, like any other day, contestants were playing their roles in Bigg Boss house
 tabhi big bos ne armaan kohli ko canfeshan room main bulaayaa or phir ghar chod dene ko kaha
 Also, as a reason, Armaan was asked to leave the house for some important work
 lekin ghar se baahar nikalate hi armaan kohli ko na to koi dost najar aayaa or na hi milane aayaa koi rishtedaar, balki lonavala kii police maujuud thi, jo armaan ko giraftaar karne ai thi
 Armaan was arrested by the police on the complaint of his fellow contestant Sophia Hayat, who lived in Bigg Boss house
 big bos kii reality sho main aisa real drama pehali baar hua he, jab ghar main hui do pratiyogiyon kii ladaai ghar kii dahleez se nikalakar sidhe thane tak ja pahunchi he
 Everyone is aware of Armaan and Sophia's relationship, from Bigg Boss contestants to viewers, but no one thought that this relationship can lead Armaan to hawala
 gaali-galouj, chhichhaledar, dekh lene kii dhamkee vagairahaa hi reality sho big-bos kii yahi euaspy he
 USP says unique selling point
 yani yahi wo baat he, jisaki vajah se lakhon log big bos shuru hote hi tivi screen se chipak jate hai
 However, this shoe show of the reality show will be so real this time, no one had thought
 sofia hayaat kii shikaayat armaan kohli giraftarbig bos ke ghar is pange kii shuruyaat tab hui thi, jab ek saptahik kaary ke dauraan armaan kohli or sofia hayaat ko do alag-alag tiimon kaa leader banaaya gaya tha
 During this toy-making work, both of them questioned not only how each other works, but also played a role in making toys
 iske baad se hi donon ke rishte lagaataar talkh hote gaye
 But the real ruckus occurred on 4 December, when Sophia was trying to clean up at a particular place in the house
 is din big bos ne ghar ke pratiyogiyon ko ek choti gaadi main zyaada der tak baithe rahane kaa kaam saunpa tha
 Sophia was kept away from this task, while Armaan was not in a position to sit in the car
 aise main donon hi gaadi ke baahar the or tabhi sofia achaanak safaai karne ke iraade se pani kii baaltee or moper lekar vahaan aa dhamkee
 Just this thing Armaan got so angry that he tried to stop Sophia and in this same snarl and rebuke, the mopper's stick started going through Sophia's cheek
 videshi mul kii ye hot model dard or apmaan se chhapatane lagi or dekhte hi dekhte usne armaan ko lekar big bos ke khilaaf bhi yalgaar kaa elaan kar diya
 Seeing the matter getting out of hand, Bigg Boss intervened and called both of them to their confession room
 sulah karaane kii koshish kii, lekin sofia jaise is baar is paar yaa us paar kii ladaai karne kii thaan chuki thi
 He ignored all the talk of Bigg Boss on this matter and remained adamant on teaching Armaan a lesson
 iske baad wo 11 disambar ko big bos ke ghar se baahar kya nikali, sidhe police ke paas ja pahunchi
 As the matter was related to a complaint received from a foreign model, the police immediately got into the act and filed a report against Armaan Kohli for the charges of assault, abuses and misbehavior
 or iske baad jo kuch hua, vaise big bos ke itihaas main pehle kabhi nahin hua tha
 It is another matter that later Armaan again got an entry in Bigg Boss house among the egg tomatoes of women
 salmaan ko armaan se zyada akhre kushalbhai, kamaal he
 On one hand, the fight broke out so much that the matter reached the police station and Armaan Kohli had to be arrested
 or duusari taraf kushal kii ladaai ghar kii parampara ke mutabik ghar kii charadivari ke bheetar hui or thandi bhi ho gai
 But it was Salman Khan, the host of Bigg Boss that Kushal was still more than Armaan
 armaan ke liye salmaan kii naramdili kaa pataa to big bos ke darshakon ko pehle hi chal chukaa tha
 But for this, no one had thought that Salman would make Kushal talk like this
 magar, is big bos kaa yahi sach he
 Why is friendship between Salman and Armaan so deep? Salman and Armaan are old friends
 bandra badies
 Armaan Na is not only the son of famous film producer Rajkumar Kohli, but also the new boyfriend of Bigg Boss contestant Tanisha Mukherjee
 ji haa, usee tanisha ke jo ajay devgan kii saali hai
 And since Ajay Devgan and Salman also have a relationship with tooth cut bread, Armaan is very close to Salman in this sense, but these closeness of personal life will dominate even small screen, it is definitely strange to see
 kyon nahin dikhaaya jaataa ghar ke andar kaa jurm?lekin yahaan baat sirf salmaan ke ravaiye kii nahin he
 It is also the matter of the company that makes Big Boss, which makes things big, but when it comes to implementation, it backfires
 ab sofia or armaan kii ladaai ko hi lijie
 On the one hand, there was such fierce fighting and fighting in the house between the two, on the other hand, Big Boss edited all those footage and covered the truth
 wo to jab sofia ne police se shikaayat kii, tab jaakar donon kii asli ladaai kii sari footage police ke haath lagi
 The question arises whether hiding the crime inside the house does not raise questions about the intentions of Bigg Boss? But the thing is even further
 ek taraf to big bos ke ghar main vaayalence yani hinsa ko galat bataaya jaataa he, vahiin duusari taraf hinsa ke aarope main giraftaar hone ke baad chhootane vaale armaan ko phir se isi ghar main jagah de di jaati he
 Now the question is that the show, from the company to the host, everyone has an inclination towards a particular cause, there are questions about the reality of the show

 This is due to the increase in the prices of fireworks by 50 to 60 per cent as compared to last year

 unhone kaha ki niyam-kanoon bhi itane sakht ho gaye hai ki tej aawaaj ke pataakhon ke alaava adhik barood vaale pataakhe banane par roak laga di gai he
 On top of this, the administration is monitoring the shopkeepers due to the rising inflation of gunpowder in inflation and Naxalite areas

 Crackers will be available at a fixed price
 chote vyapaariyon ko bhi pehle se hi bataa diya gaya he ki aapurti kii kami ke kaaran unhen bhi tay maatra main hi aatishbaajee di jaaegi
 Preference will be given to the sale of low sound and sparkling firecrackers this time over loud voice
 akhilesh gupta bataate hai ki janapad main banane vaale pataakhon se hi puri aapurti kar paanaa sambhav nahin hoga
 Apart from the district, the retail buyers of nearby districts also take firecrackers from the capital
 isliye is baar kanpur ke bane hue branded pataakhe bhi kaaphi maatra main mangaaye gaye hai
 Sugar crackers have also not come in the market yet
 pataakhon ke thok vyapaaree bataate hai ki chini pataakhon main laabh kam hone ke kaaran bhartiya vyapaariyon ne use bechney se tauba kar lee he

 Neither the black money from abroad has returned

 In view of public sentiment, the Lokpal and Lokayukta Act had to be passed in Parliament
 desh kii janata bhrashtachar ke khilaaf mahatma gandhiji ke dikhaae hue shantipurna maarg se raste par utar aayi thi
 The Gandhian leader said that at that time BJP during its election campaign should show the public the dreams of corruption free India and good days
 bhrashtachar se peedit janata ne aap kii badi badi baton par bharosa kiya or aapaki sarkaar satta main aa gai
 You must also believe that people have chosen your government only on the issue of eradicating corruption and development
 anna ne kaha ki ab teen saalon se adhik samay biit chukaa hai
 However, corruption in the country has not reduced at all but is increasing
 bhrashtachar ko rokane ke liye modi sarkaar ne badi badi baton ke sivaa kuch bhi nahin kiya he, isliye man bahut dukhi he

 Leading the way in implementing the historic tax reform system 'GST' in the country, the Lok Sabha on Wednesday approved four bills related to Goods and Services Tax and the government assured that the interests of consumers and states in the new tax system will be fulfilled Apart from keeping it safe, agriculture has not been taxed
 loksabhaa ne kendriya maal evam seva kar vidheyak 2017 (si jiesti bill), ekikrut maal evam seva kar vidheyak 2017 (ai jiesti bill), sangh rajya kshetra maal evam sevakar vidheyak 2017 (uti jiesti bill) or maal evam sevakar (rajyon ko pratikar) vidheyak 2017 ko sammilit charchaa ke baad kuch sadasyon ke sanshodhano ko naamanzoor karte hue dhvanimat se paarit kar diya
 Due to the money bill, the Rajya Sabha will now have the right to discuss these four bills
 vastu evam seva kar sambandhi vidheyakon par charchaa kaa jawaab dete hue vitt mantri ne vipaksh kii in ashankaon ko nirmul bataaya ki in vidheyakon ke jariye karadhaan ke maamle main sansad ke adhikaron ke saath samjhauta kiya ja rahaa he
 He said that the first thing is that this Parliament amended the constitution and gave the GST Council the right to recommend the rate of taxes
 jetali ne kaha ki jiesti parishad pehali sangheey nirnay karne vaali sanstha he
 The GST Council was given the authority to enact model legislation on the basis of constitutional amendment
 jahaan tak kanoon banane kii baat he to yah sangheey dhaanche ke aadhaar par hoga, vahiin sansad or rajya vidhansabhaon kii sarvocchata bani rahegi
 However, these recommendations have to be kept in mind because if different states decide different rates then chaotic situation will arise
 yah isaki sauhardrapurn vyakhya he or iskaa koi doosraa arth nahin nikaala janaa chahie
 Clarifying the situation on objections about having multiple tax rates instead of creating a uniform tax, the Finance Minister said that there are many food products which are currently taxed at zero and no tax will be levied even after the GST system is implemented
 kai chijen aisi hoti hai jin par ek samaan dar se kar nahin lagaaya ja saktaa
 For example, the rates of tobacco, alcohol, etc
 are high while the normal rate on clothes
 unhone kaha, ‘‘ab hawaii chappal or bmdablyoo car par ek samaan kar nahin lagaaya ja saktaa
 Jaitley said that during the discussion in the GST Council, it was decided that initially it would be easier to levy many taxes
 vitt mantri ne kaha ki jiesti parishad ne vichaar vimarsh ke baad jiesti vyavastha main 0, 5, 12, 18 or 28 pratishat kii daren tay kii hai
 It has also said to impose additional cess on luxury cars, bottled aerated beverages, harmful products like tobacco products and environment related materials like coal
 unhone kaha ki 28 pratishat se adhik lagane vaala upkar (ses) muaavja kosh main jaayegaa or jin rajyon ko nuksaan ho rahaa he, unhen isamen se raashi di jaayegi
 There was also a suggestion that it should be taxed
 lekin kar ke rup main lagane se upabhoktaaon par prabhaav padataa
 But no additional tax will be levied on consumers

 unhone yah bhi spasht kiya ki jiesti parishad main koi bhi faisla lene main centre kaa vot keval ek tihaai he jabaki do tihaai vot rajyon ko he
 Therefore, the Center is not in favor of imposing its opinion while making any decision

 After the implementation of GST, many other taxes including Central Excise, Service Tax and Value Added Tax (VAT) in states will be included in it
 jetali ne vidheyakon ko spasht karte hue kaha ki kendriya jiesti sambandhi vidheyak ke madhyam se utpaada, seva kar or atirikt seemaa shulk samaapt ho jane kii sthiti main centre ko kar lagane kaa adhikaar hoga

 aise main jiesti pranali ko aage badhaayaa gaya
 a tax where there is an Assessing Officer

 It was said that simple arrangements should be brought within the country

 (apart from the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it has been published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) Responding to the discussion on the Goods and Services Tax Bills, the Finance Minister stated the opposition's apprehensions that the rights of Parliament are being compromised in terms of taxation through these Bills
 unhone kaha ki pehali baat to isi sansad ne samvidhan main sanshodhan kar jiesti parishad ko karon kii dar kii sifarish karne kaa adhikaar diya he
 Jaitley said that the GST Council is the first federal decision making body
 samvidhan sanshodhan ke aadhaar par jiesti parishad ko model kanoon banane kaa adhikaar diya gaya
 As far as law making is concerned, it will be on the basis of federal structure, while the supremacy of Parliament and state legislatures will remain
 haalanki in siforeeshon par dhyaan rakhana hoga kyonki alag-alag rajya agar-alag dar tay karenge to arajak sthiti utpann ho jaayegi
 This is a cordial interpretation of it and no other meaning should be drawn from it
 ek samaan kar banane kii bajaae kai kar dar hone ke bare main aapattiyon par sthiti spasht karte hue vitt mantri ne kaha ki kai khaadya utpaada hai jinpar abhi shunya kar lagata he or jiesti pranali lagu hone ke baad bhi koi kar nahin lagegaa
 There are many things that cannot be taxed at the same rate
 jaise-tambaakoo, sharaab aadi kii daren oonchi hoti hai jabaki kapadon par saamaanya dar hoti he
 He said, "now a similar tax cannot be levied on thongs and BMW cars
 ’’ jetali ne kaha ki jiesti parishad main charchaa ke dauraan yah tay hua ki aarambh main kai kar lagaana zyada saral hoga
 The Finance Minister said that the GST Council has fixed rates of 0, 5, 12, 18 and 28 percent in the GST regime after discussions
 lakjri kaaron, bottle band vaatit peyon, tambaakoo utpaada jaisi ahitkar vastuon evam koyala jaisi paryaavaran se judi saamagree par iske upar atirikt upkar bhi lagane kii baat kahi he
 He said that the cess levied by more than 28 percent will go to the Compensation Fund and the states which are suffering losses will be given out of it
 aisa bhi suzav aayaa ki ise kar ke rup main lagaaya jaae
 But imposition of tax would have affected consumers
 lekin upabhoktaaon par atirikt kar nahin lagaaya jaayegaa
 Jaitley said that compensation will be given to those states which are suffering losses due to the implementation of GST system
 yah aarambh ke paanch vashare ke liye hoga
 He said that there was no consensus on GST during the Congress-led UPA government because there was no offer for compensation to the disadvantaged states
 jiesti main muaavje kaa praavdhaan ‘deal karne main sahaayak’ hua or rajya saath aae
 Giving clarification on the objection of many members to the real estate sector not being included in the GST, the Finance Minister said that this is an area in which states get a lot of revenue
 isamen registry tathaa anya shulkon se rajyon kii aay hoti he isliye rajyon kii raay ke aadhaar par ise jiesti main shaamil nahin kiya gaya he
 He also clarified that in taking any decision in the GST Council, the vote of the Center is only one-third while the states have two-third vote
 isliye koi bhi faisla karte samay centre apni raay thopane ke paksh main nahin he
 Terming the Goods and Services Tax as the first federal contract to be constitutionally approved, Jaitley said that through GST, the system of 'one nation, one tax' will be paved in the country by not imposing additional tax burden on consumers
 vitt mantri ne kaha ki jiesti parishad kar dhaanche ko sarvasammati se tay kar rahi he or is bare main ab tak 12 baithken ho chuki hai
 The bill is based on the principle of shared sovereignty between the central and state governments and is the first such initiative
 jiesti ke lagu hone par kendriya str par lagane vaale utpaada shulk, sevakar or rajyon main lagane vaale mulya vardhit kar (waite) sahit kai anya kar isamen samahit ho jaayenge
 Jaitley clarified the bills and said that through the Central GST Bill, the Center will have the right to levy tax in the event of excise, service tax and additional customs duty
 samanvit jiesti yaa ijiasti ke jariye vastu or sevaaon kii rajyon main awajahi par centre ko kar lagane kaa adhikaar hoga
 While clarifying the situation regarding the provision to stop earning profits in relation to tax exemption, the Finance Minister said that if 4
 5 pratishat kar chhot di jaati he tab iskaa arth yah nahin ki use nijee munafa mana jaae balki iskaa laabh upabhoktaaon ko bhi diya jaae
 This is the meaning of this provision
 vitt mantri ne kaha ki real estate kii tarah hi sthiti sharaab or petroleum utpaadon ke sambandh main bhi thi
 Petroleum products have been brought under its purview after discussions with the states but it has been kept under zero rate for now
 is par jiesti parishad vichaar karegi
 Alcohol is still outside its scope
 vitt mantri ne kaha ki pehle ek vyakti ko vyavsaay ke liye kai moolyankan agenciyon ke paas janaa padataa tha
 In order to carry on economic activities, one had to undergo excise, service tax, state VAT, Manaranjan tax, entry fee, luxury tax and many other taxes
 unhone kaha ki vastuon or sevaaon kaa desh main sugam pravaah nahin tha
 In such a situation, the GST system was pushed forward
 ek aisa kar jahaan ek moolyankan adhikari ho
 Mostly self assessment and only limited evaluation except in audit cases
 jetali ne kaha ki kar ke upar kar lagata he jisase mudrasphiti kii pravriti badhati he
 Hence the idea of making the whole country a market
 yah baat ai ki saral vyavastha desh ke andar laai jaae
 Stating that bringing agriculture under the purview of GST, the Finance Minister said that agriculture and farmers do not require registration
 dhara 23 ke tahat krishak evam krishi ko chhot mili hui he
 It is therefore placed in the definition to explain this exemption
 is bare main koi bhram nahin hona chahie
 Jaitley said that there should be no confusion about when agricultural products are zero-rate
 tippaniyan Rejecting the objections of the Congress in this regard, Jaitley said that 29 states, two Union Territories and the Center considered this, which included eight finance ministers of the Congress-ruled state
 ‘‘tab kya in sabhi ne milakar ek khaas varg ke khilaaf sajeesh kii?’’ jiesti lagu hone ke baad vastu evam jins kii keemton main vruddhi kii ashankaon ko khaarij karte hue vitt mantri ne kaha ki kar kii daren vartmaan str par rakhi jaayengi taaki iskaa mudrasphiti sambandhi prabhaav nahin pade
 Jaitley said that Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly will bring a legislation regarding GST
 (hedline ke alaava, is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he, yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he
 ) jahaan tak kanoon banane kii baat he to yah sangheey dhaanche ke aadhaar par hoga, vahiin sansad or rajya vidhansabhaon kii sarvocchata bani rahegi
 However, these recommendations have to be kept in mind because if different states decide different rates then chaotic situation will arise
 yah isaki sauhardrapurn vyakhya he or iskaa koi doosraa arth nahin nikaala janaa chahie
 Clarifying the situation on objections about having multiple tax rates instead of creating a uniform tax, the Finance Minister said that there are many food products which are currently taxed at zero and no tax will be levied even after the GST system is implemented
 kai chijen aisi hoti hai jin par ek samaan dar se kar nahin lagaaya ja saktaa
 For example, the rates of tobacco, alcohol, etc
 are high while the normal rate on clothes
 unhone kaha, ‘‘ab hawaii chappal or bmdablyoo car par ek samaan kar nahin lagaaya ja saktaa
 Jaitley said that during the discussion in the GST Council, it was decided that initially it would be easier to levy many taxes
 vitt mantri ne kaha ki jiesti parishad ne vichaar vimarsh ke baad jiesti vyavastha main 0, 5, 12, 18 or 28 pratishat kii daren tay kii hai
 It has also said to impose additional cess on luxury cars, bottled aerated beverages, harmful products like tobacco products and environment related materials like coal
 unhone kaha ki 28 pratishat se adhik lagane vaala upkar (ses) muaavja kosh main jaayegaa or jin rajyon ko nuksaan ho rahaa he, unhen isamen se raashi di jaayegi
 There was also a suggestion that it should be taxed
 lekin kar ke rup main lagane se upabhoktaaon par prabhaav padataa
 But no additional tax will be levied on consumers
 jetali ne kaha ki muaavja un rajyon ko diya jaayegaa jinhen jiesti pranali lagu hone se nuksaan ho rahaa ho
 This will be for the first five years
 unhone kaha ki congress nit samprag sarkaar ke dauraan isliye jiesti par aamasahmati nahin ban saki kyonki nuksaan vaale rajyon ko muaavje ke liye koi peshkash nahin kii gai thi

 Although other parties are protesting against this law in their own way and in their own way, but Kejriwal's sit-in or protest has a different significance because after the defeat in Lok Sabha elections, when the atmosphere in people about their sit-in is bad
 If this happens, they stop the sit-in, but in any democracy everyone has the right to protest and if something goes wrong, protesting against the strike is considered a civilized way Of opposition

 The British Prime Minister said, the government will ensure that the police have the resources to cover the cost of any valid claim
 british bimakarta sangh ne kaha he ki unhen ummid he ki yah udyog 20 karod pound tak kaa bhugtan kar sakegaa
 Cameron said, "I can declare today that we are going to give the police the right to have the right to remove clothes from their faces if there is a proper suspicion that they are associated with criminal activity
" unhone kaha ki aisi sthiti se nibatane ke liye police ko choubees ghante ke notice par pani kii bauchhaar :water canan: uplabdh karaaye jaaenge
 He said that people and companies who were targeted during the riots like a person, landlord, businessman's building or property were destroyed, even if they have not got insurance, they can still claim under the riot loss law
 camran ne kaha, vyapaar ko samarthan ke maamle main, ham prabhavit vyapaar ko phir se uth khadey hone ke liye aaj 20 karod pound kii nayi samarthan yojana shuru kar rahe hai
 He admitted that when the riot started there were fewer policemen on the streets and initially the police took it as law and order which was not a criminal case
 camran ne kaha, sachai yah he ki police nayi or anokhi chunauti se jujh rahi he kyonki ek hi samay vibhinn sthaan vibhinn log lutpaat kar rahe hai
 He said that law enforcement agencies would ensure that the image spoilers of the country are punished

 The reason is not poverty but culture

 is baat main kitni sachai he is bare main kuch nahin kaha ja saktaa
 Uttar Pradesh is one such battlefield in politics, where new political equations are formed with movements and there is no problem in standing on their head with time
 soobe kii raajnneeti main 40 saal tak brahmanon kaa dabadabaa kaayam rahanaa, 1990 ke dashak main unka haashiye par janaa or is sadi ke duusare dashak ke uttararddh main ek baar phir se king mekar banakar ubharna uttar pradesh kii isi jati aadhaarit raajnneeti ke dilachasp adhyay hai
 This script, full of thrills and climaxes like the Bombay films, is the real author - more than 8 per cent of the 62 districts of the state and more than 12 per cent of Brahmin votes in 31 of these districts
 isi kii khatir netaa pandit ji ko haath dikhaaen na dikhaaen lekin sir par brahman kaa haath jarur chaahate hai
 February 8, 2012: In the pictures, for the blessings of India Today Brahmins, the parties are engaged in presenting such Brahmin faces on their behalf, which can at least at least retail the priests
 lekin dikkat yah he ki in chehron main pandit jawaharlal nehru jaisaa viraat vyaktitv yaa atal bihari vaajapeyi jaisaa chumbakeey aakarshan to dur, khud ko sarvamaanya netaa kahalaane kaa damakham bhi najar nahin aata
 While looking at the history of the state, out of the 19 chief ministers so far, maximum 6 Chief Ministers came from the Brahmin caste and all of them belonged to the Congress
 iske baad 4 thakur, 4 pichde, 3 vaisya, 1 kysth or ek dalit mukhyamantri bana
 If we look at the total tenure, then the command of the state remained in the hands of the Brahmin chief ministers for 23 years
 1 farvari 2012: tasveeron main india todelekin pradesh ko pehla dalit mukhyamantri dene vaali basapa 2002 ke vidhansabha chunaav ke baad se hi dalit-brahman gathjod par puraa jor laga rahi he
 The party has revealed its Brahmin face as Satish Chandra Mishra
 vahiin bhartiya janata party ke paas calraj mishra or murali manohar joshi jaise brahman chehre hai
 Congress show-case Rita bahuguna-joshi, Pramod Tiwari are already there, now unheard names like Janardan Dwivedi, Sheela Dixit and Mangeram Sharma called for campaigning from Haryana
 vaise, kai congressi yahi maanate hai ki brahmanon kaa sabase bada pratinidhitiv to khud nehru-gandhi parivaar karata he
 The Samajwadi Party does not seem to be very furious about the Brahmins and Brahmin leaders like Ashok Vajpayee are sometimes seen in the party
 brahmanon ko rijhaane kii basapa kii ranneeti ko dekhen to party ne uttar pradesh main mayawati se pehle satish chandra mishra kii sabhaayen shuru karain
 In 2002, the Mishra Brahmin who joined the BSP to connect Brahmins to the head, began speeches at the fraternity conferences in such a way that 'all Brahmins touch the feet'
 jis tarah treta yug main shabari or valmiki ne milakar ramraj ko safal kiya, vaise hi pichhali baar brahman or daliton ne milakar basapa sarkaar banaai thi
 '25 January 2012: See India Today in the pictures
 He makes a strong interlace of caste figures on the manuscript of the same mythological narrative,' 15 per cent Brahmins and 23 per cent Dalits can gather and do anything
 ’ vaise, brahmanon kii 15 fisadi aabaadi kaa aankada kuch atiranjit he, lekin aadhikarik aankadon ke abhaav main sab apane aankade chalaa rahe hai
 The BSP has put 80 Brahmin candidates on the elephant in 2007 and 74 in this assembly election
 brahmanon ko tikat dene main party bhaajapa ko chunauti de rahi he
 Despite giving tickets to Pandits on such a large scale, many BSP leaders feel that the dalit-brahmin's uneasy alliance is like a wooden hand, which is difficult to replicate
 congress netaa pramod tiwari basapa ke brahman prem ko aade haathon lete hue kehete hai, ‘basapa ne brahmanon ko beizzat kar nikaala he
 Rangnath Mishra, Rakeshadhar Tripathi, Rajesh Tripathi etc
, are the entire line, of the Brahmins disrespected from the BSP
 vah party kab se brahmanon kii hitaishi ho gai
 'how is his party giving preference to Brahmins and who is the Brahmin face of Congress? On this question, Tiwari said, 'congress does not talk about caste and religion
 rahul ji party kaa cheharaa hai
 The public sees the image of Nehru ji, Indira ji and Rajiv in Rahul ji
 ’vidhansabha main congress vidhayak dal ke netaa bhale hi sidhe brahman raajnneeti yaa chehre ko saamne laane ke sawaal par kootnithik jawaab den, lekin hakeekat yah he ki party har ilaake ke liye brahman chehron kii talash main he

 The figure is up to 16 per cent in Bhole Baba's city of Benaras
 inhen ilaakon main 2007 main basapa ko bhi thok main siten mili thim
 The challenge of bringing Brahmin faces ahead of the Congress is even more because its Brahmin candidates are very few as compared to BSP, which is just 42
 party ne is baar jo tikat vitaran kiye usamen mandal raajnneeti ke mul siddhant ubharkar saamne aae or pichhadon ko khub tikat mili
 But the party does not want the Brahmins to come in the circle of the backward
 isiilie dilli se shila dikshit or haryana se maangeram sharma ko bhi chunaav prachaar ke liye bulaayaa gaya he
 On the question of the Brahmin face of the party, the party's state president Rita bahuguna-joshi says, "pramod is Tiwari, i am and the nehru-gandhi family itself is a Brahmin
" rahul ji party kaa sabase bada cheharaa hai
 In such a situation, there is no question of separate Brahmins

 He never votes outright

 mandir kii raajnneeti or sangh ke swayan sevakon ke bal par pradesh main satta ke shikhar tak pahunchane ke baad buree tarah ludhaki bhaajapa ke liye bhi brahman voter ahm hai
 The party has fielded 73 Brahmins
 lekin itane brahman utaarne ke baavjood party ko samaj nahin aa rahaa ki brahman chehre ke taur par kise pesh karen
 The BJP did not hold a direct Brahmin conference like the BSP, but through the presence of Murali Manohar Joshi at the Chanakya Sammelan in Kanpur on 1 January, the party gave indications of its aims
 party kaa doosraa brahman cheharaa calraj mishra hai
 On the question of who is the biggest Brahmin face in BJP after Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Mishra said, 'vajpayee is the top leader of the party
 ham vikaas kii raajnneeti karte hai, na ki samudaay vishesh kii
 The party has given tickets to all communities including Brahmins, Thakurs, obcs
 har samudaay ke sahyog se hi bhaajapa satta main aegi
 'but how important is the cooperation of Brahmins, this was seen by the BJP in the last Lok Sabha election, in which half of its 10 seats came from western Uttar Pradesh
 pashchimi uttar pradesh main gajiabad, bulandshahr, aligarh, mahamaya nagar, mathura or auraiya jilon main brahman matadaataaon kii sankhya 12 fisadi yaa isse adhik he
 In Mathura, 17 percent of the Brahmins are voters
 vaise mjedaar baat yah he ki bhaajapa ab bhi atal bihari vaajapeyi ke naam ko hi pradesh main apana sabase bada khewanhaar maan rahi he
 The party's election manifesto has a picture of Atal ji and hoardings are also the same
 shaayad isaki ek vajah yah he ki party brahmanon main atal ji kii apil or unki chhavi ko bhunaanaa chaahati he

 Apart from Mulayam Singh Yadav's family, Azam Khan's name appears in the list of party leaders
 party main ashok vaajapeyi jaise kuch brahman chehre hai lekin pramukhataa se ve nahin dikhaai dete
 On the other hand, Rashtriya Lok Dal president Ajit Singh, who is contesting 46 seats, was asked that you are very worried about Muslims, but the Brahmin face is somewhere? On this question, Ajit Singh said, 'we have fielded many Brahmin candidates

 28 December 2011: See India Today in pictures
 It is visible that the big Brahmin faces of the party who cannot do the work can do the work of the local candidates because Uttar Pradesh is on the point of politics where the party is bigger than the election symbol The impression will be of the candidate's name and work

 gundon, mawali or badmaash se ladane ke liye bahan-betiyon ko khud taiyaar hona padegaa
 a boy raped Nirbhaya and left him saying that he is under 18 years
 maine bharat sarkaar ko patr likhaa he ki koi baccha itnaa bada ho gaya ki wo chhedhkhani yaa rape kar saktaa he, to sajaa bhi use bado vaali hi milani chahie

 Chartered accountant Rajiv Kamal Bittu's daughter, by profession, was shocked when her neighbors in Gopalganj, Bihar, refused to go to her lap, calling them dirty
 ranchi main apane 150 vargafoot ke daftar se ho rahi thik-thaak aamadani se rajeev acchhee jindagi bitaa sakate the lekin is ghatana ke baad unhone garmi, paseene or kadi mehnat kaa rasta akhriyaar kar liya
 CA Rajiv now turned into a farmer
 desh kii kheti ko aadhuniknjariya dene ke liye yuvaaon ke judaav kii darkaar thi
 Youth are also doing this in many parts of the country
 in jigaravaalon main kuch rajeev kii tarah apane jame-jamaaye peshey se kheti main aae, to kuch ne kheti se jude sector ko kaarobaar main badal liya
 But whether it is floriculture or fisheries, dairy or vegetable, youth have made their mark in every field
 ranchi ke rajeev camel bittu kheti ke kaam ke lihaaj se nausikhua hi the
 So, he started getting information about farming from many places - Internet, interacted with Birsa Agricultural University professor and local farmers
 jharkhand main jameen hasil karnaa unke liye behad mushkil kaam tha, kyonki chotanagpur tenency act unako jameen kharidne kii ijaajat nahin detaa tha
 He then persuaded a landowner from Kuchu village near Ranchi to lease the field
 baharhaal, jhaadiyon vaali us jameen ko kheti laayak banane main rajeev ko kareeb 2
 Had to invest 5 lakh rupees
 2013 ke jaadon kii shuruyaat se pehle rajeev ne is khet main drip sinchai vagairah kii vyavastha kii or tarbooz or kharbooze kii fasal bo di
 He says, "I just took care of some basics to modernize farming
" laagat kam rakhane kii koshish kii or aisi fasal boi jisamen zyada majdoor nahin lagate
 "rajiv laughingly explains that his ca's view of costs came in handy
 unhone kabhi bhi aisi fasal nahin boi, jiskaa vajan halkaa ho
 For example, peas
 lekin vah har baar tarbooz bone se pehle matar jarur lagaate hai
 This stabilizes the nitrogen content in the soil and improves their harvest
 vaigyanik nazariye se kheti karte hue rajeev ne apane kheton main tarbooz kii belon main adhik fal aane par kuch falon ko shuru main todakar hataa diya
 He says, more fruit will affect the quality of the entire crop

 Was close to apni kamyaabi se prerit hokar rajeev ne ranchi ke ormanjhi block main anandi gaanv main 13 acre jameen lij par le lee he
 He says, "farmers benefit from my farming because i am giving them Rs 5 to 10,000 per acre
 salanaa kiraaya detaa hum or unhen apane hi khet par kaam karne kaa mehtaanaa bhi
 This makes their income higher than before
 " ab rajeev apane kheton main tarbooz or kharbooze ke alaava khire, sweet corn, or cheri tomato kii fasal bhi lagaate hai
 Instead of giving all his crop to the wholesaler for more profit, he started selling about half of it through his people
 isse bhi shuddh munafa bad gaya
 They use neem leaves and Karanja leaves as pesticides
 rajeev aage jodate hai, ''main tarbooz ke beej sidhe kheton main nahin bota
 I'd rather prepare it
 in bichadon kii ropai main ek pakhwaade kaa antar rakhane se meri fasal aane main bhi do hafte kaa antar hota he
 It benefits in marketing
 "apni kaarobaari buddhi se rajeev ne kheti ko umdaa kaarobaar main badal diya he

 aadhyatmik guruhameshaa bhartiya hi nahin hote haalanki bharat unka swaabhaavik nivas sthaan maaloom hota he
 They attract every person who has a romantic view of reality
 nirashaavadi drushti jivan ko agamya vipadaaon kaa bhandar maanati he, jahaan insaan kii kai ichchhaaon kii niyati apurna rah janaa hi hoti he or jinka ant insaan kii mrityu ke saath hi hota he
 In contrast to this view, life in a romantic perspective is not painful, but an exploration of happiness
 yah anveshan janmonjanmon tak chalata rahata he
 These Babas and spiritual masters promise to reach this "higher" reality, which is full of miracles and fundamental changes in life and consciousness
 aisa hameshaa nahin tha
 The early Vedas and Upanishads did not have the so-called God of today but were a guru or a Buddhist preacher, who was not like a miraculous Baba but a teacher, giving knowledge of spirituality and giving disciples traditional teachings from their own experiences
 Used to learn to take exams
 shikshak guru se rahasyamay guru or phir swaghoshit bhagavaanon tak jo parivartan hua he use sabase zyada gati 7veen sadi main uttar or dakshin bharat main bhakthi andolan ke pradurbhaav ke saath mili
 And 1000 AD
 ke aasapaas tantric sampradaayon ke failaav ke saath guruon ne na sirf ishwar se milaane kaa maarg dikhaanaa shuru kiya, balki ve khud bhi bhagwaan ban baithe
 The Guru now became God, who had an extraordinary personality equipped with all divine powers
 iske baad in gurubhagavaanon ke charnon kii vandana, sashtaang dandavat karnaa or bhakthibhaav ke kaaran aadar ke aise hi duusare tauratrike shuru hone lage
 The divine boon or Guru's offerings began to be distributed
 or gurushishy parampara bigadakar is badale hue rup main aa gai
 Now the key word is 'love', not 'knowledge'
 vichaar kii pechidagiyon aurtark kii pidaaon ko badi aasaani se darkinar kar diya ja saktaa tha kyonki ishwar tak pahunchane kaa jariya upanishdon kaa gyaan sunanaa, manan yaa chintan nahin rah gaya, balki iske liye in bhagavaanon kii sharan main khud ko uttar bharat ke muhaavarey main kahen to tan, man or dhan se puri tarah arpit kar dena ho gaya
 In Kabir's words - Pothi Padhapad Jag mua, Pandit bhaya na koye, two and a half akhar (alphabets) love kapade so pandit guru jab manushya se bhagwaan banane laga to isi ke sathsath shishy bhi vayask se balak main badalane laga
 Now the ideal disciple is one who never questions anything, is pure from heart and does not have the qualities of an adult, especially the quality of questioning
 guru or shishy kii is tarah kii chhaviyaan or unke aise adarsh sambandh hindu maansikta main aaj bhi paryaapt gaharaai sebse hue hai
 Some modern Indians may think that these religious leaders are the center of all anti-intellectual and authoritarian tendencies of Hindu society
 phir bhi hinduon kii badi jansankhya ke liye ye bhagwaan unke antarjagat ke liye prakaash punj bane hue hai
 The evil attraction of these Gods is not only due to the triumph of irrationality over logic, the triumph of slavery over autonomy or the contemporary blind age triumph over the ancient golden age, but more complex reasons are working behind it
 in bhagavaanon ke astitv kii ek badi vajah yah aasthaa he ki unke andar daivi shakti he jiske jariye ve daihik or maansik pidaa ko dur kar sakate hai
 The work of removing diseases can be clearly seen in these babas and goddesses
 inaki prasiddhi mukhya rup se vyaadhiyon kaa ilaaj karne kii khabaron ke kaaran hoti he, na ki kisi paaramparik granth se kuch aadhyatmik yaa darshanik vyakhya nikaalane ke kaaran
 In my conversations with the followers of many Baba's, i found that it was due to the stories of miraculous healing that these people got attracted towards them and it helped to spread the community of their followers
 kuch aise bhakt bhi the, jinke maamle main upachaar ek shant prakriya rahi, unke jivan main baba ke aane ke baad niraashaa ke kaale badal chante, shaayad naidrushti milane ke kaaran
 So some people went to Baba's or goddess's asylum to heal the wounds of a relationship with a parent in childhood, seeing her as an ideal parent
 in baabaaon yaa deviyon ne unhen apana khoyaa aatmbal waapas paane kaa doosraa avasar dekar nayaa jivan diya, vyakti ke jivan main antarangta or shakti kaa punah sanchaar kiya
 The predominance of the moment of healing in the Guru and the follower during the meeting gives the image of the Guru as the divine parent and the devotee of the child
 jo log pashchim se shuru hui samtawadi aadhunik vichaardhaara se prabhavit hai, unki najar main kisi baba ke karishme ke prati anuyaayi kaa aasaani se aakarshith hona aatmbal kii kami or maansik asahaayta ko pratibimbit karata he, jise baba yaa guru ke saath tadatmya sthapit karke yaa use adarsh maan kar nivaaran karne kii jarurat mahasoos hoti he
 Since the conquest of the path of devotion, traditional Indian thinking about this surrender is fundamentally different and far more positive
 guru ke prati aatmasamarpan kaa bhav manushya keekalpanashiltaa ke do bade moolbhoot aadhaar se paidaa hota he
 These are - treating someone as an ideal ("you are great") and realizing someone with you ("you are great but i am part of you")
 is aatmasamarpan main ek aisi maansikta banane or majboot hone lagati he, jo guru ke prati kisi bhi taarkik yaa aalochanatmak bhav par baari padati he
 Swami Muktananda, a spiritual master, writes of the experience of one of his devotees himself, "when you surrender yourself to the Guru, you become like a valley, a void, an infinite deep pit
" aapmen gaharaai aa jaati he, na ki oonchai
 This dedication can be experienced in many ways
 guru aapmen prakat hone lagata he, uski urja aapke andar pravaahit hone lagati he
 "but it would be difficult to digest this kind of dedication of Indians to Western experiences with demonic charismatic religious leaders or rulers (hitler, Stalin)
" lekin main samajhta hum ki donon hi is baat par sahamat honge ki aadhyatmik guru kaa jo aakarshan hota he vah jivan kii ekadam shuruyaat or samvadamein nihit hota he
 Asking a person why he follows a guru is akin to questioning why the boy puts his father's hat on his head or why a little girl tries to walk wearing his mother's slippers

 Now the days of Baghdadi were over
 kuch dinon pehle jis turki main ji-20 ke deshon ne ek saath haath milakar bagdadi ke aatank ke safaaye kii kasam khai thi, wo kasam das din main bikhar gai
 America and Russia stood up against each other

 Now the way America's attitude has changed while fighting Baghdadi
 turki rus ke khilaaf khadaa he, usase sawaal uthte hai ki kya duniya vishwa yuddh kii taraf bad rahi he

 But Hollande is also not allowed to get on the ground and fight against the Baghdadi terrorists in Syria
