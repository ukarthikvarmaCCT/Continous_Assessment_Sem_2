 Votes were cast on Sunday in the sixth phase of the Lok Sabha elections 2019 in Hisar seat of Haryana
 hisar main chunaav ayog ke aadhikarik aankadon ke mutabik 72
 19 percent voting was recorded
 haryana main loksabhaa chunaav 2019 main kul 70
 21 percent voting was recorded
 is seat par 26 ummidavaar maidan main hai
 The BJP has nominated Brijendra Singh, son of Bijender Singh, while the Congress has fielded the grand Bishnoi against him
 indian neshnal lok dal suresh kothi ko tikat diya he
 Dushyant Chautala is trying his luck on Jannayak Janata Party ticket
 aam aadmi party or jananaayak janata party gathbandhan main chunaav lard rahi hai
 In 2019, the Hisar Lok Sabha seat is witnessing an exciting contest
 haryana kii yah ek aisi loksabhaa seat he, jisapar bhartiya janata party ko kabhi jeet nahin mili he
 This time the results can be startling as there is no major alliance in Haryana before the elections
 raajnneeti ke alaava hisar shahar kaa apni ek alag pahchaan he
 The city is India's largest producer of galvanized iron, making it also known as the city of steel
 puure pradesh main modi lahar ke baavjood hisar seat par 2014 main bhartiya janata party kii pakad dhili pad gai thi
 In this seat, Dushyant Chautala of Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) defeated Kuldeep Bishnoi of Haryana Janhit Congress (HJC BL)
 2014 main chunaav main bijepi or (HJC BL) ke bich gathbandhan tha
 According to the alliance, BJP and Kuldeep Bishnoi's party contested 8 seats out of 10 seats
 2014 main chautaala ko kul 4,94,478 vot mili the, jabaki bishnoi ko 4,62,631 vot pade the
 In this way, young Dushyant Chautala won from Hisar Lok Sabha constituency by 31,847 votes
 2014 main INLD ko haryana main hisar or sirsa loksabhaa seat se santosh karnaa padaa tha
 What is the equation right now, the INLD has been split in the current time
 INLD par ab abhaya chautaala kaa kabja he, to dushyant chautaala se apane pita ajay singh chautaala or bhai digvijay chautaala ke saath milakar jananaayak janata party (JJP) naam se nai party khadi kar di he
 In fact, Dushyant Chautala was expelled from the Lok Dal after a quarrel in Om Prakash Chautala's family, following which he formed the Jananayak Janata Party on 9 December 2018
 pehali baar yah party jind vidhansabha kaa upachunaav ladi
 By the way, the Chautala family gets the vote of the Jat community at large
 lekin parivaar main dophaad se 2019 main donon ko nuksaan kii sambhaavna he
 In such a situation, the path of BJP and Congress can be easy
 2014 ke chunaav se pehle hisar purv mukhyamantri bhajan laal or unke putr kuldeep bishnoi kaa garh mana jaataa tha
 The constituency of Hisar Lok Sabha consists of 9 assembly constituencies
 2014 loksabhaa chunaav ke mutabik hisar main kul 11,94,689 matadaataaon ne apane matadhikaar kaa prayog kiya tha
 There were 6,53,423 male and 5,41,266 female voters
 2014 main hisar loksabhaa ke andar kul 1202 poling booth banaae gaye the
 BJP has not won the seat of Hisar till date
 1951 se ab tak yahaan par 7 par congress ko kamyaabi mili he, ek tarah se is seat par pichley kareeb 3 dashak bhajan laal or devi laal ke parivaar kaa kabja rahaa he
 In the last three decades, only in 2004, Jai Prakash of Congress won from here
 yuva dushyant chautaala sansad main puure kaarykaal ke dauraan sakriy dikhe
 He attended Parliament during the 191 debate
 jabaki wo 17 baar privet member bill lekar aae the
 Chautala's activism in Parliament can be seen from the fact that he asked a total of 582 questions during his 5-year term
 vahiin dushyant ne apane saansad nidhi kosh kaa kareeb 80 fisad fund kaa istemaal kar chuke hai
 In a way, the vicious Chautala's political journey can be called spectacular
 lekin 2014 main inke saamne chunautiyaan kaaphi thim
 For the inexperienced Dushyant Chautala at the age of 26, contesting from Hisar was a tough test
 kyonki saamne modi lahar par savaar gathbandhan ke ummidavaar kuldeep bishnoi the
 In such a situation, it was not easy to defeat Kuldeep
 lekin dushyant ko jeet mili
 Dushyant Chautala was born on 3 April 1988
 hisar kii sthapana san 1354 main tughlaq vansh ke shaasha firoz shah tughlaq ne kii thi
 At that time Tughlaq named it hisar-e-firoza
 uske baad akbar ke shashan main is shahar ke naam se firoza hataa diya gaya or phir keval hisar rah gaya
 Looking at the mirror of history, Hisar was ruled by many kingdoms
 teesri sadi i
 e main maury rajvansh, 13veen sadi main tughlaq vansh, 16veen sadi main mughal samrajya or phir 19veen sadi main british samrajya kaa is shahar par kabja rahaa tha

 tippaniyan See promo here yahaan dekhen promo- On the occasion of Rakshabandhan, the sisters in Uttar Pradesh have received a fabulous gift from Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav
 is tohfe ke paane waalon kii sankhya bhi koi choti moti nahin balki kareeb 90 hajaar hai
 Sisters of UP have received this gift in the form of Kanya Vidya Dhan, under which checks of Rs
30 thousand are being given to meritorious girls who have passed the intermediate examination in 2016
 rakshabandhan ko dhyaan main rakhkar rajya sarkaar 16 or 17 taarikh ko khaas abhiyaan chalaakar ye check baant rahi he
 Assembly elections are on the head and all the girls who get Kanya Vidyadhan are such who will vote for the first time in the elections
 islikhilesh yadavasarkaar is yojana ke peeche puri takat laga rahi he
 After distributing the check of Kanyavidya Dhan in Lucknow on Wednesday, Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav said in his speech that he needed votes from the sisters
 akhilesh yadav ne kaha ki medhaavi ladakiyon ko achche number laane par sarkaartohfade rahi he
 But he also needs a good number to come back to government again
 aatank ke khilaaf ladaai lard rahe hindustan ko badi kamyaabi mili he
 After a long debate, the Security Council of the United Nations has declared jaish-e-mohammed leader Maulana Masood Azhar as a global terrorist
 ab tak china is mudde par vito lagaataa rahaa he lekin ab antarrashtriya dabaav kii vajah se china apana vito hataane ko taiyaar ho gaya he
 Diplomatically, this victory for India is also historic because this is the first time that a terrorist has been declared as an international terrorist after being held responsible for an attack in Jammu and Kashmir
 darasal, abhi tak bharat ke jin dushmano ko global aatanki banaaya gaya he usamen lashkar-e-taiyaba ke mukhiya hafiz said shaamil he
 Hafiz Saeed is accused of attacking Mumbai, not Jammu and Kashmir
 lekin moulana masood ajahar kaa maamla isse alag hota he
 Masood Azhar, a resident of Masood Azhar, who has been associated with Kashmir, begins the whole history of Masood Azhar, whether it is the Kandahar scandal or the major terrorist attack in Pulwama
 darasal, 90 ke dashak se hi masood ajahar jammu-kashmir main active rahaa he
 He was arrested in 1994 from Srinagar
 magar, qandahar cond ke baad bharat sarkaar ko use reeha karnaa padaa tha
 Since then he has become a matter of concern for India
 bharat se reeha hone ke baad masood ajahar ne jaish-e-mohammad naam kaa sanghathan banaaya, jisane abhi tak hindustan main kai aatanki vaardaaton ko anjaam diya he
 jaish-e-mohammed's hand behind what attacks in India
 
 
 2001 main sansad par hamalaa2016 main pathankot hamalaa2019 main pulavama aatanki hamalaaye to wo aatanki hamale hai, jinka dhyaan puri duniya kii taraf gaya
 But apart from this, there are small terrorist attacks or encounters with the army every day in Kashmir
 usamen bhi jaish-e-mohammad ke aatanki shaamil rahete hai
 Why is the Factor of Kashmir important? Actually, declaring a global terrorist due to violence in Jammu and Kashmir is a big incident
 wo isliye kyonki is kshetra ko puri duniya abhi tak vivaadit maanati rahi he or har baar ye sandesh detii rahi he ki is vivaad ko pehle donon deshon ko baatcheet kar suljhaana chahie
 Not only this, Pakistan may have been asking for help to other countries, but India has been opposing the entry of any third country
 haalanki, bharat ne har baar kaha he ki jammu-kashmir main aatank failaane ke liye pakistan kii jameen kaa hi istemaal hota rahaa he
 Pakistan was also continuously opposing that if the name of jaish-e-mohammed is removed from the names of the conspirators of Pulwama, it will also support to declare it a global terrorist
 kya aap is baat par yakeen karenge ki chah maheene kaa ye baccha bal katwane ke liye salon jaataa he? aap soch rah honge ki chah maheene ke bachche ke sir par bal hi kitne hote hai jo use salon jane kii jarurat padati hogi
 But let us tell you that this child has as much hair as an adult
 Fergus Hillman kii umr mahaj chah maheene he
 He has had his hair cut twice at such a young age
 aamtaur par bacchon ko janm ke do-teen saal tak hair-cat kii jarurat nahin padati he
 But Fergus' jeans have these qualities, due to which his hair is very thick and big
 bachche kii maa Hayley Hillman joki ek nurse hai, kaa kahana he ki mere sir par bhi bahut bal hai ormere pita ke bhi khub bal the
 When you see it compared to other children, you realize how many hairs are on its head
 wo bataati hai ki Fergus se milane waalon ko yakeen nahin hota he ki uske sir par itane bal hai or wo use dekhakar hansate hai
 Fergus also has a two-month-old cousin who has minimal hair on the head
 vahiin uski apni bahanfaill ke sir par bhi janm se hi achche-khaase bal the
 Fergus's first hair-cut was when he was just four months old and recently he once again went for short hair
 Fergus kimaa kaa kahana heki duusari baar jab wo apane bete ko hair-cat ke liye le kar gai thim to jaise hi heredressor ne uske baalo main kanghee shuru kii wo so gaya
 He says that his son is very cheerful and active
 use apni bahan ke saath khelnaa bahut pasand he

 japani duutavas ke mutabik, ab vija aasaani se milegaa or zyada se zyada bhartiya logon ko milegaa
 People will also get exemption in multiple visa entry with proper documents
 multiple vija ke liye ab sirf 3 documents (passport, photo sahit vija aplikeshan form, touriston ke liye aarthik samarthy kaa pramaan,bijness ke silsilemein yatra kar rahe logon ko sambandhit company ke pramaan) kii zarurat padegi
 Indian students will also benefit from this

 haalanki ab in ilaakon ke logon ko yahaan halaat bigadane par china kaa dar nahin sataata he
 They say that our Indian troops are here to protect us
 lihaaja darane kii koi baat nahin he
 People from the border areas adjacent to China may be struggling with all the problems including electricity, water, phone and employment, but their spirits are on the seventh sky
 inkaa kahana he ki seemaa par sanyakarmiyon kii maujuudagi he, jiske chalate china se darane kii koi jarurat nahin he
 The problems of the people here become worse in bad weather

 People living here are not afraid of China today, because they are sure of their jawans

 Doklam's tension is visible everywhere on the india-china border
 lihaaja sena kii taiyaari sirf sikkim border par hi nahin, balki ladakh ke barfile ilaakon par bhi he
 Apart from this, preparations are on to give a suitable reply to the dragon in the forward post of ITBP in the border areas of Uttarakhand
 36 din baad bhi chhattis kaa aankadadoklam main china kii dadaageeri kaa chhatisvaan din he
 The dragon does not see the eagle coming from his antics
 vah rojaanaa dhamkee de rahaa he
 Thirty-six days later, the figure of thirty-six between the two countries remains intact
 ajtak kii team ne uttarakhand ke chamoli jile ke aakhri sarahadi gaanv mana pahunchi

 Before preparations for a major reshuffle in the Council of Ministers of the Narendra Modi government at the Center, the Congress targeted Prime Minister Modi, saying that he believed in 'complete centralization of power', which has completely ruined the cabinet system of the government
 congress ke varisht pravaktaa anand sharma ne kaha ki pherbadal se sarkaar main koi fark nahin aane vaala, kyonki mantriparishad main pratibha kii kami he
 Anand Sharma said that he does not see much talent in them
 yun to mantriparishad main pherbadal pradhanmantri kaa visheshadhikaar he, lekin isse koi fark nahin padane vaala
 The comments unhone yahaan patrakaron se kaha ki vah kisi ko niyukt kar sakate hai or kisi ko hataa sakate hai or kisi kaa mantralay badal sakate hai, lekin isse koi fark nahin padane vaala, kyonki yah aise pradhanmantri hai jo satta ke purna kendrikaran main vishwaas rakhte hai
 The former Union Minister said that there is a cabinet system of government in the country, but it is not known whether she is also working in that way or not
 unhone kaha ki ahm mantralayon ko teen saal se adhik samay tak cabinet mantri ke bagaiyr rakhaa gaya, jo pehle kabhi nahin hua tha
 From input language anand sharma ne kaha ki unhen unamem zyada pratibha nahin dikhti
 Although the reshuffle in the Council of Ministers is the prerogative of the Prime Minister, but it does not matter
 tippaniyan He told journalists here that he can appoint someone and remove someone and change someone's ministry, but that does not matter, because it is a prime minister who believes in complete centralization of power
 purv kendriya mantri ne kaha ki desh main sarkaar kii cabinet pranali he, lekin pataa nahin ki ab vah us tarah se kaam kar bhi rahi he ki nahin
 He said key ministries were held for more than three years without a cabinet minister, which had never happened before

 '' Kiran Bedi, a key aide of Gandhian activist Anna Hazare, reacted sharply to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's statement on the Lokpal Bill, accusing him of being insensitive to people's sensibilities
 unhone kaha ki vah ek ‘dhokhaa vidheyak’ ko desh par thope rahe hai or iske virodh main hone vaali bhukh hadtaal tathaa anshan ko galat bataa rahe hai
 Kiran Bedi, who was the first woman IPS officer of the country, wrote on micro-blogging website Twitter that the Prime Minister is imposing the cheat bill on the country and terming hunger strike and fast as wrong
 vah chaahate hai ki ham unki baat maan len
 Kiran Bedi said that if the Prime Minister was sensitive to the views of the people, he could have announced his withdrawal rather than imposing 'jokpal'
 unhone kaha ki pradhanmantri anshan ke kaarnon par nahin ja rahe hai
 It is against the imposition of the (fast) cheating bill which does not include effective things
 kiran bedi ne kaha ki aatmasamarpan kaa arth he ki sarkari lokapal ko maan lenaa jisamen aam aadmi ke liye kuch bhi nahin he
 Instead it spreads a legal illusion
 isse pehle singh ne swatantraaa diwas ke maukey par diye bhaashan main bhrashtachar par lagaam lagane ke liye ek majboot lokapal kaa vaayada kiya or mana ki centre or rajya sarkaron ke kuch logon par bhrashtachar ke aarope hai

 The names of Goa's mining businessman Radha Satish Timblu, Dabur Group Chairman Pradeep Burman and Rajkot businessman Pankaj Chamanlal were in the discussion since Monday morning
 lekin shaam dhalate-dhalate ellection kamishan watch kii ek khabar ne ise nayaa mode de diya
 The new revelation in the case is that Timblu Private Limited has only won 1 BJP in the last 9 years
 18 karod rupee chunavi chanda diya he
 The desire for donations from corporate companies is not new to political parties
 lekin ellection kamishan watch kii khabar ne kalaadhan maamle main nayaa romaanch jarur jod diya he
 Accordingly, between the financial years 2004-05 and 2011-12, Radha Timblu gave BJP 1
 18 karod, jabaki 7 varshon mencongressko 65 lakh rupee kaa chanda diya he
 Not only this, according to the report, in the financial year 2011-12, Chamanbhai Lodhiya of Rajkot has also donated 51 thousand rupees to the BJP
 gauratlab he ki desh main 13 elactoral trust hai, jinamein sirf 7 sibiditi se apruv hai
 The reason behind this is that these trusts were formed in 2013 after the CBDT Rules
 baaki chah trust sibiditi se apruv nahin hai isliye niyamon ke mutabik vah chanda dene ke kram main is babat koi janakri saajha nahin karte
 According to CBDT rules, all the 7 trusts are required to report their donations to the Election Commission
 dilachasp yah bhi he ki baaki 6 trust ne bhi vittiya varsh 2004-05 or 2011-12 ke bich 105 karod rupee kaa chanda diya he, jisaki bare main nirvachan ayog ko adhik jaankaree nahin he
 This means that due to lack of information, it is difficult to say that the contribution of the companies through the remaining 6 trusts to the parties was actually a tax exemption basis or a way to white out black money
 jaahir taur par khulaason or kaledhan ke is daur main jarurat is baat kii bhi he ki baaki 6 elactoral trust chande kii rakam ke bare main vistaar se jaankaree den taaki sahi myne main kaledhan par sthiti saaf ho sake
 These 6 trusts include General Electoral Trust, Electoral Trust, Corporate Electoral Trust, Bharti Electoral Trust and Satya Electoral Trust

 The ATS is now preparing to interrogate the celebrity

 The ATS had filed an application in the Nashik court alleging that it wanted to interrogate the leader of a Hindu organization in UP but was facing difficulties in it

 The sp's self-confidence was shattered after it was defeated in the Lok Sabha elections, but the victory in the assembly by-elections has changed the party's attitude
 bade badlaav kaa isharaamulaayam or akhileshke behad najdiki netaaon se bhi laal batti chin lee gai he
 Apart from Mulayam Singh's early companions Rajkishore Mishra, Sukhram Yadav, Madhukar Jaitley and Jaishankar Pandey, the SP has clearly indicated that leaders like Akhilesh Yadav, Rajpal Kashyap, Sunil Yadav, Naved Siddiqui, Ashu Malik were removed from the rank of ministers
 Work will be the yardstick to move forward in the party

 Perhaps this was the reason why the SP started mobilizing the extremely backward castes immediately after the election, for a by-election for a Rajya Sabha seat
 ati pichhadon main kashyap, bind, nishad jatiyon kii taadaad zyada he
 Keeping this number in mind, the SP sent Vishambhar Prasad Nishad, a former MP from the Nishad caste, to Rajya Sabha
 duusari ore yuva netaa raajapaal kashyap ko ati pichhadi jatiyon main lagaataar sabhaayen kar party kii paith badhaane kaa jimmaa saunpkar mulaayam ne apane iraade bhi jaahir kar die the
 In the Lok Sabha elections, a large part of the non-yadav backward and extremely backward classes of the state was mobilized in favor of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)

 The University of Delhi has tightened its name change rules, mandating the approval of the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) for any such request
 vishvavidhyalay main chaatrasangh chunaavon ke dauraan naam badalane kaa aksar durupyog hota he
 An official notice said that it is clarified that it is mandatory for students desirous of changing the name to first change the name from CBSE or State Board

 Uttar Pradesh Advocate General VC Mishra has received another notice of violation of election code of conduct
 un par sarkari daure ke samay sattarudh raajnneetik dal sapa ke paksh main prachaar kaa aarope he
 The Election Commission has received such reports from the District Election Officers of Mahoba, Moradabad and Banda
 notice ke mutabik ayog ko pehle bharosa diya gaya tha ki mahadhivaktaa ke sarkari daure ke samay kisi party ke paksh main matadaataaon ko prabhavit nahin jayega
 Government machinery will also not be used for election related work
 teen jilon ke nirvachan adhikariyon se mili report ke anusaar unhone sarkari daure main chunaav kaary kiya he
 The Commission has called the Advocate General's official visit a mix of election visits and sought clarification from him
 duusari ore visi mishra ne ayog par palatwaar karte hue kaha he ki chunaav ayog bijepi ke ishaare par kaam kar rahaa he
 Since he opposed the petition of Amit Shah, due to which he had to withdraw the petition, hence retaliatory action is being taken
 mahadhivaktaa ne kaha ki vah notice kaa jawaab dene ko taiyaar hai magar ayog un par lage aaropon kii sidi saunpe
 He says that before that he had visited 23 districts, the Commission did not give notice
 isse pehle jedies pramukh devgauda ne bhi enditivi se baat karte hue puure maamle par apni raay jaahir kii thi
 He called this situation worse than the Emergency
 16 vidhayakon ke istife par devgauda ne kaha tha ki bijepi kisi bhi tarah dakshin ke rajya main satta main aana chaahati he
 Deve Gowda had said, 'ever since Kumaraswamy took over the post of CM with the support of the Congress, the state BJP leader BS Yeddyurappa has been trying to break our mlas
 yediurppa 2009 se oparation camel ko khinchne kii koshish kar rahe hai
 Although the BJP does not have a majority, they resigned 10 of our mlas
 'bijepi dwaara baagi vidhayakon ko rupye die jane ke sawaal par devgauda ne kaha, 'unhone diya
 However, on the resignation of the mlas, the BJP has been saying so far that it has no hand in it and the mlas have taken this decision of their own accord
 naukari series ke 19wein ank main aapkaa swaagat he
 i used to think that unemployment is a collective term
 is shabd ke istemaal se sabhi berojgaaron ke kaan khadey ho jate hai
 But going through hundreds of messages during the job series, it seemed that the youth are divided into different groups about their jobs, their exams
 ek samooh kaa duusare samooh kii berojgaare yaa pareshaani se koi matlab nahin he
 The unemployment of the railways is different from the unemployment of the BPSC examination and the two have no meaning to each other
 yahi pattern aap har do samooh ke bheetar dekhenge
 This is the reason that even after the number is high, the youth have no political status, nor does it matter to any party or government by postponing their examinations for four years
 yuva chote chote samooh main ladate hue khud ke liye berojgaar jaise shabd kaa istamaal to karata hua samooh he
 This is why our youth are fighting their battles but their scope is so limited that the leaders do not care
 abhi bharat ke yuvaaon ko chaar paanch saal or ghatiya pariksha vyavastha ke saath jeena hi hoga
 Neither the youth recognize the reasons for their ruin nor their sensible parents
 hamaare yuvaaon kii polytical quality yaa samaj vaaki bahut karaab he
 The preliminary examination of the State Service and the Forest Service took place on 18 February in Madhya Pradesh
 chaar din baad ayog ne jab apni website par puche gaye prashnon ke uttar daale to chaatr hairaan rah gaye
 They could not understand whether the question itself was asked incorrectly or the answer was given incorrectly
 kareeb kareeb 15 aise prashn the jinhen lekar vivaad ho gaya
 Newspapers in Madhya Pradesh are full of these controversial questions
 jaise bharat chodo kaa naaraa kisne diya tha, is sawaal ke jawaab main jawahar laal nehru likhaa he jo ki galat he
 Yusuf Meher Ali gave this slogan
 yahi nahin, ab kisi chaatr ko yah bataanaa he ki jawaab galat he to iske liye use ek sawaal ke liye 100 rupee kii fees bharani hogi
 This time there is a dispute about 15 questions, then you will pay a fee of 1500 rupees, then you will be able to challenge the commission that the answer you have presented is wrong
 duniya main aisi nayab vyavastha aapako kahin nahin dikhegi
 If the mistake is of the commission then it should rectify itself but it has been happening that the commission is asking for 1500 rupees from the students who have declared their mistake
 thik vaise he jaise kal koi mukhyamantri kahe ki aapako meri galati bataani he to aapako 1500 rupee fees deni hogi
 Would you consider this arrangement rational? ayog kah saktaa he ki badi sankhya main chaatr chunauti dene lagate hai, dene hi chahie jab sawaal galat honge, jawaab galat honge to lakhon chaatro ko chunauti deni chahie lekin iske badale kya unase fees lee jaaegi
 Is it not right that the Commission would reform itself and print its answer that this is the answer, our answer is not wrong
 is pariksha ke baad chaatr pareshaan hai ki fees dekar ayog kii galati sabit karen yaa andolan karen, yah sab karenge to padhenge kab
 The students have prepared the memorandum
 ve mukhyamantri se lekar rajyapal sabhi ko de rahe hai
 The Secretary is also giving memorandum to et cetera
 nai duniya ne likhaa he ki 2010 ke saal main to 40 sawaal badalane pade the
 After eight years, there has been so much improvement that 15 questions have arisen
 aap chahen to isi ko vikaas samaj sakate hai
 It is evident that the students have lost sleep
 kya hamen ek eemaandaar or behatar pariksha vyavastha nahin chahie, yah kyon hai ki har rajya main yuva pareshaan hai magar kisi rajya main yah sawaal nahin he
 Have the youth decided that their future is just and only from a topic like Hindu Muslim Debate
 agar yuva apni-apni pariksha ko lekar rote rahenge to unke rajya main kabhi ek behatar pariksha vyavastha nahin banegi
 So do not speak for yourself but also for others
 railway aprintis ke chaatr pradarshan karen to van seva vaale bhi usamen jaaen or bipiessi ke chaatr pradarshan karen to usamen banking pariksha vaale bhi jaaen, varna kranti kaa wo gaanaa rose suna kiijie, wo javaani javaani nahin, jisaki koi kahani nahin
 If you do not understand anything, then watch TV less now
 slogan main swarg nahin hota he
 When the poor farmers affected by the Narmada Dam in Madhya Pradesh came out with this method of demonstration, very few of the youth of the state would have supported them, but now when they have passed on themselves, they are stealing the idea of the performance of those farmers
 madhya pradesh main swasthya vibhaag main sanvida yani edock par kaam karne vaale in dinon anishchit kaaleen hadtaal par hai
 They are demanding to be permanent
 kehete hai wo jitna kaam karte hai, utane hi kaam ko permanent karne waalon ko dugana paisa miltaa he
 When these young men were not allowed to set up their tents in Seoni district, they landed in the river Vanga Ganga
 subah saadhe gyaarah baje se lekar shaam chaar baje tak pani main rahete hai
 As long as everyone will fight in different groups, even after going down the river, then the system will not be affected
 ye basic baat samajni hi padegi
 Whether you watch prime time or not
 ye log 12 se 18 saal se kaam kar rahe hai, abhi tak permanent nahin hue hai
 2000 have also been removed in the name of closure of plans and review
 ye log siwani zila aspataal, civil aspataal, saamudayik swasthya seva centre main nurse hai, pharmacist hai, data entry oparator hai
 Our colleague from Uttarakhand Dinesh Mansera has told that there are many different kinds of unemployed movements taking place across the state
 jis tarah se mujhe berojgaar shabd ke bare main gyaan praapt hua usee tarah se dinesh mansera ko ek gyaan praapt hua he
 That is, the government in the state has divided many recruiters into science and art, and has clashed the unemployed among themselves
 jaise railway kii bhartee ko lekar itiai or gair itiai ke chaatr aapas main bhide hue hai
 On February 26, about 30 women performing in front of the Uttarakhand Chief Minister's house were caught and taken to the bus
 un sabake paas nursing main diploma he
 On March 15, 2016, two years before today, an advertisement for 440 female health workers in Uttarakhand was released
 300 or 600 kii fees jamaa kar 6600 se zyada eenem diploma dhari mahilaon ne aavedan kiya
 When the new government came, the category changed
 kaha gaya ki 440 padon par unheen nursing diploma waalon ko mauka milegaa jinhone 12veen main science padhaa he
 Now, with this one decision, 5500 women were dropped out who had studied 12th Arts
 jabaki in mahilaon ne uttarakhand sarkaar se manyata praapt sarkari or privet nursing college se padhane ke liye teen saal main teen se chaar lakh rupee kharch kiye hai
 At that time the government should have made a policy that women passing Arts will not be able to get a nursing degree
 sarkari nursing college main bhi arts or science donon se grajuation karne vaali mahilaon nursing kar sakati hai
 Then why this division in giving jobs
 bahaali kii prakriya ko vivaadit bana dena koi ranneeti lagati he taaki isi main cese mukadmaa hota rahe or time cat jaae
 Did not get a job, now these girls are demonstrating, fighting the case by raising money
 yahi nahin foresti guard, udyaan vibhaag, van nigam kii bhariyon main bhi science or arts kaa bantwaaraa kar diya gaya he
 The unemployed are divided in the same way, what can be better than these conditions
 tata institute of soshal sciensez main paanch dinon se chaatr pradarshan kar rahe hai
 Demonstrations are going on not only in the Mumbai campus but also in the remaining three campuses of Tissus
 prashasan ke saath baithak to hui magar samaadhaan nahin niklaa he
 Will you ever meet the students of Tis, their quality is very good, not only are they qualified in studies, these students have also done amazing work in social service
 par ye pradarshan isliye kar rahe hai kyonki anusuchit jati, janajati or obisi ke chaatro ko milane vaali chaatravrutti kii suvidha bharat sarkaar ne waapas le lee he
 TIS has issued an order that the students of the 2016-18, 2017-19 batch pay tuition fees, hostel fees and dining fees
 in chaatro ko post metric scolership kii suvidha mil rahi thi jo ab band ho gai he
 According to the media report, the Tis administration says that the scholarship has not been withheld
 indian express kii priyanka sahu se baat karne hue tis prashasan ne kaha he ki santhaan apane str par sansaadhan jutaney kaa prayaas kar rahaa he
 This is strange logic
 jab sarkaar scolership de rahi thi to wo milani chahie
 Now i will mention a problem that i do not know the solution for
 saansad se lekar chaatro ne kai baar upiessi se kaha magar inkaa samaadhaan nahin hota
 Whenever the form of UPSC comes out, these students get restless in the hope of being given a chance
 taminladu or kerala se bhi chaatro ne sampark kiya tab laga ki baat rakh dete hai
 You know that in 2011, CSAT was applied in UPSC preliminary examination
 ise lekar khub sawaal uthe or bavaal hua
 The students said that the new system is in such a way that students of science, engineering and English medium benefit
 arts ke chaatr peeche rah jaaenge or hindi madhyam ke chaatro ko nuksaan ho
 Once the movement of the CSAT had caught vigor, big leaders came in support of them
 29 janvari 2018 ko upiessi ke saamne chaatro ne pradarshan kiya tha
 In 2015, the government removed CSAT from the qualifying round
 sarkaar ne yah bhi faisla kiya ki jin chaatro ne 2011 main pehali baar upiessi kii pariksha di thi unhen ek baar or pariksha dene kaa mauka diya jayega
 But in 2012-13, 2013-14, the students who suffered loss due to CSAT want to get a chance
 unka maananaa he ki sisat jaisi vyavastha ke kaaran unka chance bhi barbaad hua he
 This year, when the students of Jammu and Kashmir were given a five-year relaxation in the age limit to appear in the UPSC Civil Service Examination, these students were again hopeful and restless
 inkaa kahana he ki jab siem mahamuba mufti ke prayaas se inhen chhot mil sakati he to hamen kyon nahin mil rahi he
 Perhaps these students are feeling cheated by the way TV presented Kashmir in the name of hindu-muslim debate and they became its customers
 ham nahin jaanate ki upiessi kya faisla legi lekin agar in chaatro ko yahi lagata he ki prime time main uthaa dene bhar se unka kaam ho jayega to yahi sahi
 These students should also ask a question to themselves when the students of other examinations perform, do they go in them, their sorrow hurts them, if the question is not answered then even in prime time, nothing will be done
 
 dua karuunga ki inhen ek chance mil jaae
 i would request that Hindu Muslims play an active role in closing the debate or else they are not young people, who will have to listen to a song with no story
 aap dekh rahe hai naukari series kaa 19waan ank
 The Central Bank of India has not yet given a joining letter to more than 700 students even though the years have passed
 aap hi bataaiye 700 se adhik chaatr pariksha paas kar chuke hai, merit list main aa jane ke baad kaiyon ne naukari chhod di, ab unhen 11 maheene se jwainig letters nahin mil rahaa he
 Don't you think that this is a bigger news than a politically fixing match
 khabaron kaa apana swaad or praathamikta badal lijie varna aapke saath bahut bada dhokhaa hone vaala he balki ho chukaa he
 Allahabad has an Uttar Pradesh Public Service Commission office, in front of which students demonstrated last Friday
 ye chaatr ejeeniyar hai
 There was a written examination in 2013 for the recruitment of Assistant Engineer and Junior Engineer
 jei ke 3222 pad the or assistant ejeeniyar ke 952 pad the
 The advertisement came out in 2013, after three years of written examination on 11-12 April 2016
 jei kii likhit pariksha hui 22-23 may 2016 ko
 Two years have passed since then, but the results have not come
 11 disambar 2017 ko ayog ke saamne in naujavaanon ne pradarshan kiya to likhit aashwaasan mila ki 15 farvari ko assitant ejeeniyar or april main junior ejeeniyar kaa riselt nikaal denge
 It has been 11 days consumed on 15 February
 yah bharat desh main hi ho saktaa he ki 2013 kii pariksha kaa parinaam farvari 2018 tak nahin aayaa he
 That is why i say that the youth of India are very exaggerated while their political quality is very poor
 karaab na hoti to is tarah kii thagi unke saath har rajya main nahin hoti
 My words may seem bad, but they check themselves, my words will be correct
 patna main hamaare sahyogi manish kumaar se shaareerik chunautiyon vaale chaatr milane aae
 You will be disturbed after listening to what they told
 2010 main ye log pariksha paas kar vibhinn padon ke liye chune gaye the
 Their number is 49
 inhone jwine to kiya magar aath maheene baad bihar karmchaaree chayan ayog ne naukari se hataa diya
 In the same way, he was removed from his job by joining the jail in Jharkhand after two years of training
 kaaran bataaya gaya ki viklaangata aarakshan kaa sahi paalan nahin hua he
 The advertisement for this examination was released in 2010, the result came on 24 August 2013 after three years
 janvari 2014 se lekar agast 2014 tak naukari par rahe magar baad main hataa die gaye
 They have expected from the prime time job series that the government might listen
 aap soch rahe honge ki is desh main adaalat he yaa nahin
 Absolutely the court is there and the Patna High Court also ordered on August 20, 2015 that these 49 handicapped be reinstated
 abhi tak bahaali nahin hui he
 He again went to the High Court and in December 2016 again the High Court said that he should be reinstated
 magar nahin hui
 Do you think that when no one is affected by two orders of the High Court, prime time will matter
 tippaniyan We started the job series with the Staff Selection Commission exam
 pichley episod main hamane zikr kiya tha ki maharashtra cirkil ke postal vibhaag se jwining ke liye 353 noujvaan chitthee kaa intazaar kar rahe the
 We had emphasized Maharashtra Circle in the 17th issue of the Prime Time Job Series
 aaj maharashtra cirkil kii website par posting kii khabar aa gai he
 353 youth have been told whose posting will be in which branch and city
 yah hamaare liye bhi khushi kii baat he
 If a show can affect the lives of 353 students, then i will do the job series by July instead of May
 kya hamaare bharat ke noujvaan ek eemaandaar pariksha vyavastha nahin hasil kar sakate hai, iraadaa kar lenge to hasil bhi kar lenge
 Staff Selection Commission exam is also a good news for the students of CGL 2016
 hamane is pariksha kaa bhi sawaal uthaaya tha ki paas kar chuke naujavaanon ko jwining letters nahin diya ja rahaa he
 The CBDT, an institution of Income Tax Department, was waiting for joining by passing the examination for 1114 posts
 pehle episod main bhi iskaa zikr kiya tha
 After eight months, you will get the letter now
 inakam tex inspector ke pad par jinaki niyukti hui he unhen nirdesh diya jaataa he ve apni pasand kii jagah paane ke liye chunaav karen or farm jamaa karen
 Let us also be asking when is Holi, when is Holi
 
 
 madhya pradesh ke akhbaar in vivaadit prashnon se bhare hai
 Just like who gave the slogan of Quit India, Jawaharlal Nehru has written in response to this question, which is wrong
 yousuf meher ali ne yah naaraa diya tha
 Not only this, now a student has to tell that if the answer is wrong, for this, he will have to pay a fee of Rs 100 for a question
 is baar 15 sawaal ko lekar vivaad he to 1500 rupee kii fees bharenge tab jaakar aap ayog ko chunauti de sakenge ki aapane jo uttar pesh kiya he wo galat he
 You will not see such a unique system in the world
 galati ayog kii he to use khud hi sudhaar karne chahie magar ho yah rahaa he ki ayog apni galati bataane vaale chaatro se 1500 rupee maang rahaa he
 It is just like if a chief minister says tomorrow that if you want to tell me my mistake, then you have to pay a fee of 1500 rupees
 kya aap is vyavastha ko tarksangat maanenge
 The Commission can say that a large number of students start challenging, when questions should be wrong, if the answers are wrong then lakhs of students should be challenged, but will they be charged a fee instead
 kya yah sahi nahin rahata ki ayog khud sudhaar karata or apni taraf se jawaab chhapata ki yahi jawaab he, hamaara jawaab galat nahin he
 After this examination, students are worried that if they prove the mistake of the commission by paying fees or agitate, they will study it when they do it
 chaatro ne gyaapan taiyaar kar liya he
 They are giving everything from Chief Minister to Governor
 sachiv vagairah ko bhi gyaapan de rahe hai
 The New World has written that in the year of 2010, 40 questions had to be changed
 aath saal baad itnaa sudhaar hua he ki 15 sawaalon par sawaal uth gaye hai
 If you want, you can understand this as development
 zaahir he chaatro kii neend ud gai he
 Should we not want an honest and better examination system, why is it that the youth are troubled in every state, but there is no question in any state
 kya yuvaaon ne yah tay kar liya he ki unka bhavishya sirf or sirf hindu muslim dibet jaise topic se he
 If the youth continue to cry for their exams then there will never be a better examination system in their state
 to apane liye nahin duusare ke liye bhi bolie
 If the railway apprentice students perform, then the Forest Service also attend it and the students of BPSC perform it, then go to the banking examinations, or listen to that song of Kranti daily, not that young man, who has no story
 kuch samaj nahin aa rahaa he to philhal tivi kam dekhie
 Slogan does not have heaven
 madhya pradesh main narmada baandh se prabhavit garib kisaanon ne jab pradarshan kaa yah tarika nikaala to rajya ke yuvaaon main se kam hi ne unka saath diya hoga lekin ab jab khud par beeti he to un kisaanon ke pradarshan kaa idia churaakar pradarshan kar rahe hai
 These days the workers working on contract in the health department in Madhya Pradesh are on indefinite strike
 ve permanent kiye jane kii maang kar rahe hai
 It is said that the more work they do, the more they receive double the money
 siwani zile main jab in naujavaanon ko apana tambu tak lagane nahin diya gaya to ye wan ganga nadi main utar gaye
 They remain in the water from eleven to half past four in the morning
 jab tak sab alag alag samooh main ladenge nadi ke baad naale main bhi utar jaaenge to bhi system ko fark nahin padegaa
 This basic thing has to be understood
 chaahe aap prime time dekhen yaa na dekhen
 These people have been working for 12 to 18 years, yet have not been cleared
 yojana band karne or kaarysamiksha ke naam par 2000 nikaal bhi die hae hai
 These people are nurses in Suture District Hospital, Civil Hospital, Community Health Service Center, are pharmacists, are data entry operators
 uttarakhand se hamaare sahyogi dinesh mansera ne bataaya he ki rajya bhar main berojgaaron ke alag alag prakaar ke kai andolan ho rahe hai
 Just as i gained knowledge about the term unemployed, in the same way Dinesh Mansera has gained a knowledge
 vah yah ki rajya main sarkaar ne kai bhartiyon ko vigyaan or kala main baant kar berojgaaron ko hi aapas main bhida diya he
 For example, ITI and non-iti students are at loggerheads over the recruitment of Railways
 26 farvari ko uttarakhand mukhyamantri awaas ke saamne pradarshan kar rahi kareeb 30 mahilaon ko pakad kar bas main le jaaya gaya
 They all have diplomas in nursing
 15 march 2016 yani aaj se do saal pehle uttarakhand main mahila swasthya kaaryakarta ke liye 440 padon kaa vigyaapan niklaa
 More than 6600 ANM diploma-holding women applied by depositing fees of 300 and 600
 nai sarkaar ai to category badal gai
 It was said that only those nursing diplomas who have studied science in 12th class will get 440 positions
 ab is ek faisle se 5500 mahilaayein baahar ho gayi jinhone 12veen arts padhaa tha
 Whereas these women have spent three to four lakh rupees in three years to study from government and private nursing colleges recognized by the government of Uttarakhand
 tabhi sarkaar ko yah niti banani chahie thi ki arts se paas hone vaali mahilaayein nursing kii degree nahin le sakati hai
 In the Government Nursing College also, women graduating from both Arts and Science can do nursing
 phir naukari dene main yah bantwaaraa kyon
 There seems to be a strategy to make the restoration process disputed so that the case will continue in the case and time is cut
 naukari mili nahin, ab ye ladkiyaan pradarshan kar rahi hai, paise jutakar cese lard rahi hai
 Not only this, science and arts have also been distributed in the fills of Forest Guard, Horticulture Department, Forest Corporation
 berojgaar vaise hi bante hue hai, in sharton se or bant jaaen isse behatar sthiti kya ho sakati he
 Students have been performing at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences for five days
 mumbai campus hi nahin, tisus ke baaki teen campus main bhi pradarshan chal rahaa he
 There was a meeting with the administration but no solution has been found
 aap kabhi tis ke chaatro se miliega, inaki quality kaaphi acchhee he, padhai main yogya to hai hi, samaaj seva main bhi in chaatro ne kamaal kiya he
 But these demonstrations are happening because the Government of India has withdrawn the scholarships for SC, ST and OBC students
 tis ne aadesh jari kiya he ki 2016-18, 2017-19 batch ke chaatr tution fees, hostel fees or dining fees kaa bhugtan karen
 These students were getting post matric scholarship facility which is now closed
 media report ke anusaar tis prashasan kaa kahana he ki chaatravrutti nahin roki gai he
 Speaking to Priyanka Sahu of Indian Express, Tis administration has said that the institute is trying to raise resources at its level
 yah ajeeb tark he
 It should be met when the government was giving scholarships
 ab ek aisi samasya kaa zikr hoga jiskaa samaadhaan mujhe pataa nahin
 Students from MP to UPSC have told UPSC many times but these are not resolved
 jab bhi upiessi kaa farm nikalataa he ye chaatr ek chance die jane kii ummid main baichaiyn ho uthte hai
 Students from Tamil Nadu and Kerala also contacted, then felt that they would keep the talk
 aap jaanate hai ki 2011 main upiessi kii praarambhik pariksha main sisat lagu kiya gaya tha
 a lot of questions arose and caused ruckus
 chaatro kaa kahana tha ki nai pranali is tarah se he ki science, ejineering or angrezi madhyam ke chaatro ko phayda ho
 Arts students will be left behind and Hindi medium students may suffer
 sisat kaa andolan ne ek baar jor pakadaa tha tab bade bade netaa inke samarthan main aae the
 The students performed in front of UPSC on 29 January 2018
 2015 main sarkaar ne sisat ko qualifing round se hataa diya
 The government also decided that the students who had appeared for the UPSC for the first time in 2011, would be given the chance to take the exam one more time
 lekin 2012-13, 2013-14 main jin chaatro ko sisat ke kaaran nuksaan hua wo chaahate hai ki unhen bhi ek chance mili
 They believe that their chance is also ruined due to a system like CSAT
 is saal jab jammu-kashmir ke chaatro ko upiessi civil sarvice pariksha main baithne ke liye umr seemaa main paanch saal kii chhot di gai to phir se ye chaatr ashanvit ho gaye or baichaiyn bhi
 They say that when CM Mahmuba Mufti's efforts can give them exemption, then why are we not getting them
 shaayad ye chaatr hindu-muslim dibet ke naam par tivi ne kashmir ko jis tarah se pesh kiya or ye uske graahak bane ab thage hue se mahasoos kar rahe hai
 We do not know what the UPSC will decide, but if these students feel that they will be done with a lift in prime time, then it is right
 in chaatro ko ek sawaal khud se bhi poochna chahie jab duusari parikshaon ke chaatr pradarshan karte hai to kya ve unamem jate hai, unke dukhon se unhen takalif hoti he, agar sawaal kaa jawaab naa main he to prime time main bhi uthaane se kuch nahin hoga
 i pray that they get a chance
 guzarish karuunga ki hindu muslim dibet band karaane main sakriy bhoomika adaa karen varna wo javaani javaani nahin jisaki koi kahani nahin vaala gaanaa sunanaa padegaa
 You are watching the 19th issue of the Job Series
 central bank aaf india ne abhi tak 700 se adhik chaatro ko jwining letters nahin diya he jabaki pariksha paas kiye hue saal biit gaye hai
 You tell me, more than 700 students have passed the exam, many have left the job after getting in the merit list, now they are not getting joining letter for 11 months
 kya aapako nahin lagata ki politicil phixing vaale match se kahin zyaada ye badi khabar he
 Change your taste and preference for news, otherwise you are going to be cheated a lot
 elahabaad main uttar pradesh lok seva ayog kaa daftar he, iske saamne chaatro ne pichley shuukravaar ko pradarshan kiya
 These students are engineers
 sahaayak ejeeniyar or junior ejeeniyar kii bhartee ke liye 2013 main likhit pariksha hui thi
 JE had 3222 posts and Assistant Engineer had 952 posts
 vigyaapan niklaa 2013 main, likhit pariksha hui teen saal baad 11-12 april 2016 ko
 The written examination of JE took place on 22-23 May 2016
 iske baad se do saal biit gaya magar riselt nahin aayaa he
 On 11 December 2017, these youths demonstrated in front of the Commission and received written assurance that on February 15, the results of Assistant Engineer and Junior Engineer will be out in April
 15 farvari ko bhasma hue 11 din ho gaye hai
 It may be in India only that the result of the 2013 examination has not come till February 2018
 tabhi main kahata hum bharat ke naujavaanon ko kaaphi badha chadha kar pesh kiya jaataa he jabaki inaki polytical quality bahut karaab he
 If it was not bad, such a fraud would not happen to them in every state
 meri baat buree lag sakati he magar ve khud se check kar len meri hi baat sahi lagegi
 Students with physical challenges came to meet our colleague Manish Kumar in Patna
 inhone jo haal bataaya wo sunakar aap behaal ho jaaenge
 In 2010, these people passed the exam and were selected for various posts
 inaki sankhya 49 he
 He joined but after eight months, the Bihar Staff Selection Commission removed him from the job
 thik usee tarah jaise jharkhand main daaroga kii do saal kii training dekar, jwining kara kar unhen naukari se hataa diya gaya
 The reason given was that the disability reservation has not been properly followed
 is pariksha kaa vigyaapan 2010 main niklaa tha, teen saal baad 24 agast 2013 ko riselt aayaa tha
 He was employed from January 2014 to August 2014 but was later removed
 inhen prime time kii naukari series se ummid ho gai he ki shaayad sarkaar sun le
 You must be wondering if there is a court in this country
 bilkul adaalat he or patna hoicourt ne 20 agast 2015 ko order bhi diya tha ki in 49 viklangon ko phir se behaal kiya jaae
 Restoration has not yet taken place
 ye dobaaraa hoicourt gaye or disambar 2016 main phir se hai court ne kaha ki inaki bahaali ho
 But it did not happen
 aapako lagata he ki hoicourt ke do do adeshon se jab kisi ko fark nahin padaa to prime time se fark padegaa
 The comments hamane naukari series kii shuruyaat staff salection kamishan kii pariksha se kii thi
 In the last episode, we mentioned that 353 youths were waiting for the letter to join the postal department of Maharashtra Circle
 hamane prime time kii naukari siries ke 17wein ank main maharashtra cirkil par jor diya tha
 Today the news of posting on the website of Maharashtra Circle has arrived
 353 naujavaanon ko bataa diya gaya he ki kiski posting kis branch or shahar main hogi
 It is also a pleasure for us
 agar ek sho se 353 chaatro ke jivan par asar pad saktaa he to naukari series may kii jagah july tak karuunga
 Can not the youth of our India achieve an honest examination system, if we intend, we will also achieve it
 staff salection kamishan kii pariksha sijiel 2016 ke chaatro ke liye bhi ek khushkhabari he
 We had also raised the question of this examination that the joining letter is not being given to the youth who have passed
 iskar vibhaag kii sanstha sibiditi ke liye 1114 padon ke liye pariksha paas kar jwining kaa intazaar kar rahe the
 It was also mentioned in the first episode
 aath maheene baad ab chitthee milegi
 Those who have been appointed to the post of Income Tax Inspector are instructed to elect their place of choice and submit the form
 chaliye ye bhi puch rahe honge ki holi kab he, kab he holi
 
 
 Should we not want an honest and better examination system, why is it that the youth are troubled in every state, but there is no question in any state
 kya yuvaaon ne yah tay kar liya he ki unka bhavishya sirf or sirf hindu muslim dibet jaise topic se he
 If the youth continue to cry for their exams then there will never be a better examination system in their state
 to apane liye nahin duusare ke liye bhi bolie
 If the railway apprentice students perform, then the Forest Service also attend it and the students of BPSC perform it, then go to the banking examinations, or listen to that song of Kranti daily, not that young man, who has no story
 kuch samaj nahin aa rahaa he to philhal tivi kam dekhie
 Slogan does not have heaven
 madhya pradesh main narmada baandh se prabhavit garib kisaanon ne jab pradarshan kaa yah tarika nikaala to rajya ke yuvaaon main se kam hi ne unka saath diya hoga lekin ab jab khud par beeti he to un kisaanon ke pradarshan kaa idia churaakar pradarshan kar rahe hai
 These days the workers working on contract in the health department in Madhya Pradesh are on indefinite strike
 ve permanent kiye jane kii maang kar rahe hai
 It is said that the more work they do, the more they receive double the money
 siwani zile main jab in naujavaanon ko apana tambu tak lagane nahin diya gaya to ye wan ganga nadi main utar gaye
 They remain in the water from eleven to half past four in the morning
 jab tak sab alag alag samooh main ladenge nadi ke baad naale main bhi utar jaaenge to bhi system ko fark nahin padegaa

 When the poor farmers affected by the Narmada Dam in Madhya Pradesh came out with this method of demonstration, very few of the youth of the state would have supported them, but now when they have passed on themselves, they are stealing the idea of the performance of those farmers
 madhya pradesh main swasthya vibhaag main sanvida yani edock par kaam karne vaale in dinon anishchit kaaleen hadtaal par hai
 They are demanding to be permanent
 kehete hai wo jitna kaam karte hai, utane hi kaam ko permanent karne waalon ko dugana paisa miltaa he
 When these young men were not allowed to set up their tents in Seoni district, they landed in the river Vanga Ganga
 subah saadhe gyaarah baje se lekar shaam chaar baje tak pani main rahete hai
 As long as everyone will fight in different groups, even after going down the river, then the system will not be affected
 ye basic baat samajni hi padegi
 Whether you watch prime time or not
 ye log 12 se 18 saal se kaam kar rahe hai, abhi tak permanent nahin hue hai
 2000 have also been removed in the name of closure of plans and review
 ye log siwani zila aspataal, civil aspataal, saamudayik swasthya seva centre main nurse hai, pharmacist hai, data entry oparator hai
 Our colleague from Uttarakhand Dinesh Mansera has told that there are many different kinds of unemployed movements taking place across the state
 jis tarah se mujhe berojgaar shabd ke bare main gyaan praapt hua usee tarah se dinesh mansera ko ek gyaan praapt hua he
 That is, the government in the state has divided many recruiters into science and art, and has clashed the unemployed among themselves
 jaise railway kii bhartee ko lekar itiai or gair itiai ke chaatr aapas main bhide hue hai
 On February 26, about 30 women performing in front of the Uttarakhand Chief Minister's house were caught and taken to the bus
 un sabake paas nursing main diploma he
 On March 15, 2016, two years before today, an advertisement for 440 female health workers in Uttarakhand was released
 300 or 600 kii fees jamaa kar 6600 se zyada eenem diploma dhari mahilaon ne aavedan kiya
 When the new government came, the category changed
 kaha gaya ki 440 padon par unheen nursing diploma waalon ko mauka milegaa jinhone 12veen main science padhaa he
 Now, with this one decision, 5500 women were dropped out who had studied 12th Arts
 jabaki in mahilaon ne uttarakhand sarkaar se manyata praapt sarkari or privet nursing college se padhane ke liye teen saal main teen se chaar lakh rupee kharch kiye hai
 At that time the government should have made a policy that women passing Arts will not be able to get a nursing degree
 sarkari nursing college main bhi arts or science donon se grajuation karne vaali mahilaon nursing kar sakati hai
 Then why this division in giving jobs
 bahaali kii prakriya ko vivaadit bana dena koi ranneeti lagati he taaki isi main cese mukadmaa hota rahe or time cat jaae
 Did not get a job, now these girls are demonstrating, fighting the case by raising money
 yahi nahin foresti guard, udyaan vibhaag, van nigam kii bhariyon main bhi science or arts kaa bantwaaraa kar diya gaya he
 The unemployed are divided in the same way, what can be better than these conditions
 tata institute of soshal sciensez main paanch dinon se chaatr pradarshan kar rahe hai
 Demonstrations are going on not only in the Mumbai campus but also in the remaining three campuses of Tissus
 prashasan ke saath baithak to hui magar samaadhaan nahin niklaa he
 Will you ever meet the students of Tis, their quality is very good, not only are they qualified in studies, these students have also done amazing work in social service
 par ye pradarshan isliye kar rahe hai kyonki anusuchit jati, janajati or obisi ke chaatro ko milane vaali chaatravrutti kii suvidha bharat sarkaar ne waapas le lee he
 TIS has issued an order that the students of the 2016-18, 2017-19 batch pay tuition fees, hostel fees and dining fees
 in chaatro ko post metric scolership kii suvidha mil rahi thi jo ab band ho gai he
 According to the media report, the Tis administration says that the scholarship has not been withheld
 indian express kii priyanka sahu se baat karne hue tis prashasan ne kaha he ki santhaan apane str par sansaadhan jutaney kaa prayaas kar rahaa he
 This is strange logic
 jab sarkaar scolership de rahi thi to wo milani chahie
 Now i will mention a problem that i do not know the solution for
 saansad se lekar chaatro ne kai baar upiessi se kaha magar inkaa samaadhaan nahin hota
 Whenever the form of UPSC comes out, these students get restless in the hope of being given a chance
 taminladu or kerala se bhi chaatro ne sampark kiya tab laga ki baat rakh dete hai
 You know that in 2011, CSAT was applied in UPSC preliminary examination
 ise lekar khub sawaal uthe or bavaal hua
 The students said that the new system is in such a way that students of science, engineering and English medium benefit
 arts ke chaatr peeche rah jaaenge or hindi madhyam ke chaatro ko nuksaan ho
 Once the movement of the CSAT had caught vigor, big leaders came in support of them
 29 janvari 2018 ko upiessi ke saamne chaatro ne pradarshan kiya tha
 In 2015, the government removed CSAT from the qualifying round
 sarkaar ne yah bhi faisla kiya ki jin chaatro ne 2011 main pehali baar upiessi kii pariksha di thi unhen ek baar or pariksha dene kaa mauka diya jayega
 But in 2012-13, 2013-14, the students who suffered loss due to CSAT want to get a chance
 unka maananaa he ki sisat jaisi vyavastha ke kaaran unka chance bhi barbaad hua he
 This year, when the students of Jammu and Kashmir were given a five-year relaxation in the age limit to appear in the UPSC Civil Service Examination, these students were again hopeful and restless
 inkaa kahana he ki jab siem mahamuba mufti ke prayaas se inhen chhot mil sakati he to hamen kyon nahin mil rahi he
 Perhaps these students are feeling cheated by the way TV presented Kashmir in the name of hindu-muslim debate and they became its customers
 ham nahin jaanate ki upiessi kya faisla legi lekin agar in chaatro ko yahi lagata he ki prime time main uthaa dene bhar se unka kaam ho jayega to yahi sahi
 These students should also ask a question to themselves when the students of other examinations perform, do they go in them, their sorrow hurts them, if the question is not answered then even in prime time, nothing will be done
 
 dua karuunga ki inhen ek chance mil jaae
 i would request that Hindu Muslims play an active role in closing the debate or else they are not young people, who will have to listen to a song with no story
 aap dekh rahe hai naukari series kaa 19waan ank
 The Central Bank of India has not yet given a joining letter to more than 700 students even though the years have passed
 aap hi bataaiye 700 se adhik chaatr pariksha paas kar chuke hai, merit list main aa jane ke baad kaiyon ne naukari chhod di, ab unhen 11 maheene se jwainig letters nahin mil rahaa he
 Don't you think that this is a bigger news than a politically fixing match
 khabaron kaa apana swaad or praathamikta badal lijie varna aapke saath bahut bada dhokhaa hone vaala he balki ho chukaa he
 Allahabad has an Uttar Pradesh Public Service Commission office, in front of which students demonstrated last Friday
 ye chaatr ejeeniyar hai
 There was a written examination in 2013 for the recruitment of Assistant Engineer and Junior Engineer
 jei ke 3222 pad the or assistant ejeeniyar ke 952 pad the
 The advertisement came out in 2013, after three years of written examination on 11-12 April 2016
 jei kii likhit pariksha hui 22-23 may 2016 ko
 Two years have passed since then, but the results have not come
 11 disambar 2017 ko ayog ke saamne in naujavaanon ne pradarshan kiya to likhit aashwaasan mila ki 15 farvari ko assitant ejeeniyar or april main junior ejeeniyar kaa riselt nikaal denge
 It has been 11 days consumed on 15 February
 yah bharat desh main hi ho saktaa he ki 2013 kii pariksha kaa parinaam farvari 2018 tak nahin aayaa he
 That is why i say that the youth of India are very exaggerated while their political quality is very poor
 karaab na hoti to is tarah kii thagi unke saath har rajya main nahin hoti
 My words may seem bad, but they check themselves, my words will be correct
 patna main hamaare sahyogi manish kumaar se shaareerik chunautiyon vaale chaatr milane aae
 You will be disturbed after listening to what they told
 2010 main ye log pariksha paas kar vibhinn padon ke liye chune gaye the
 Their number is 49
 inhone jwine to kiya magar aath maheene baad bihar karmchaaree chayan ayog ne naukari se hataa diya
 In the same way, he was removed from his job by joining the jail in Jharkhand after two years of training
 kaaran bataaya gaya ki viklaangata aarakshan kaa sahi paalan nahin hua he
 The advertisement for this examination was released in 2010, the result came on 24 August 2013 after three years
 janvari 2014 se lekar agast 2014 tak naukari par rahe magar baad main hataa die gaye
 They have expected from the prime time job series that the government might listen
 aap soch rahe honge ki is desh main adaalat he yaa nahin
 Absolutely the court is there and the Patna High Court also ordered on August 20, 2015 that these 49 handicapped be reinstated
 abhi tak bahaali nahin hui he
 He again went to the High Court and in December 2016 again the High Court said that he should be reinstated
 magar nahin hui
 Do you think that when no one is affected by two orders of the High Court, prime time will matter
 tippaniyan We started the job series with the Staff Selection Commission exam
 pichley episod main hamane zikr kiya tha ki maharashtra cirkil ke postal vibhaag se jwining ke liye 353 noujvaan chitthee kaa intazaar kar rahe the
 We had emphasized Maharashtra Circle in the 17th issue of the Prime Time Job Series
 aaj maharashtra cirkil kii website par posting kii khabar aa gai he
 353 youth have been told whose posting will be in which branch and city
 yah hamaare liye bhi khushi kii baat he
 If a show can affect the lives of 353 students, then i will do the job series by July instead of May
 kya hamaare bharat ke noujvaan ek eemaandaar pariksha vyavastha nahin hasil kar sakate hai, iraadaa kar lenge to hasil bhi kar lenge
 Staff Selection Commission exam is also a good news for the students of CGL 2016
 hamane is pariksha kaa bhi sawaal uthaaya tha ki paas kar chuke naujavaanon ko jwining letters nahin diya ja rahaa he
 The CBDT, an institution of Income Tax Department, was waiting for joining by passing the examination for 1114 posts
 pehle episod main bhi iskaa zikr kiya tha
 After eight months, you will get the letter now
 inakam tex inspector ke pad par jinaki niyukti hui he unhen nirdesh diya jaataa he ve apni pasand kii jagah paane ke liye chunaav karen or farm jamaa karen
 Let us also be asking when is Holi, when is Holi
 
 
 uttarakhand se hamaare sahyogi dinesh mansera ne bataaya he ki rajya bhar main berojgaaron ke alag alag prakaar ke kai andolan ho rahe hai
 Just as i gained knowledge about the term unemployed, in the same way Dinesh Mansera has gained a knowledge
 vah yah ki rajya main sarkaar ne kai bhartiyon ko vigyaan or kala main baant kar berojgaaron ko hi aapas main bhida diya he
 For example, ITI and non-iti students are at loggerheads over the recruitment of Railways
 26 farvari ko uttarakhand mukhyamantri awaas ke saamne pradarshan kar rahi kareeb 30 mahilaon ko pakad kar bas main le jaaya gaya
 They all have diplomas in nursing
 15 march 2016 yani aaj se do saal pehle uttarakhand main mahila swasthya kaaryakarta ke liye 440 padon kaa vigyaapan niklaa
 More than 6600 ANM diploma-holding women applied by depositing fees of 300 and 600
 nai sarkaar ai to category badal gai
 It was said that only those nursing diplomas who have studied science in 12th class will get 440 positions
 ab is ek faisle se 5500 mahilaayein baahar ho gayi jinhone 12veen arts padhaa tha
 Whereas these women have spent three to four lakh rupees in three years to study from government and private nursing colleges recognized by the government of Uttarakhand
 tabhi sarkaar ko yah niti banani chahie thi ki arts se paas hone vaali mahilaayein nursing kii degree nahin le sakati hai
 In the Government Nursing College also, women graduating from both Arts and Science can do nursing
 phir naukari dene main yah bantwaaraa kyon
 There seems to be a strategy to make the restoration process disputed so that the case will continue in the case and time is cut
 naukari mili nahin, ab ye ladkiyaan pradarshan kar rahi hai, paise jutakar cese lard rahi hai
 Not only this, science and arts have also been distributed in the fills of Forest Guard, Horticulture Department, Forest Corporation
 berojgaar vaise hi bante hue hai, in sharton se or bant jaaen isse behatar sthiti kya ho sakati he
 Students have been performing at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences for five days
 mumbai campus hi nahin, tisus ke baaki teen campus main bhi pradarshan chal rahaa he
 There was a meeting with the administration but no solution has been found
 aap kabhi tis ke chaatro se miliega, inaki quality kaaphi acchhee he, padhai main yogya to hai hi, samaaj seva main bhi in chaatro ne kamaal kiya he
 But these demonstrations are happening because the Government of India has withdrawn the scholarships for SC, ST and OBC students
 tis ne aadesh jari kiya he ki 2016-18, 2017-19 batch ke chaatr tution fees, hostel fees or dining fees kaa bhugtan karen
 These students were getting post matric scholarship facility which is now closed
 media report ke anusaar tis prashasan kaa kahana he ki chaatravrutti nahin roki gai he
 Speaking to Priyanka Sahu of Indian Express, Tis administration has said that the institute is trying to raise resources at its level
 yah ajeeb tark he
 It should be met when the government was giving scholarships
 ab ek aisi samasya kaa zikr hoga jiskaa samaadhaan mujhe pataa nahin
 Students from MP to UPSC have told UPSC many times but these are not resolved
 jab bhi upiessi kaa farm nikalataa he ye chaatr ek chance die jane kii ummid main baichaiyn ho uthte hai
 Students from Tamil Nadu and Kerala also contacted, then felt that they would keep the talk
 aap jaanate hai ki 2011 main upiessi kii praarambhik pariksha main sisat lagu kiya gaya tha
 a lot of questions arose and caused ruckus
 chaatro kaa kahana tha ki nai pranali is tarah se he ki science, ejineering or angrezi madhyam ke chaatro ko phayda ho
 Arts students will be left behind and Hindi medium students may suffer
 sisat kaa andolan ne ek baar jor pakadaa tha tab bade bade netaa inke samarthan main aae the
 The students performed in front of UPSC on 29 January 2018
 2015 main sarkaar ne sisat ko qualifing round se hataa diya
 The government also decided that the students who had appeared for the UPSC for the first time in 2011, would be given the chance to take the exam one more time
 lekin 2012-13, 2013-14 main jin chaatro ko sisat ke kaaran nuksaan hua wo chaahate hai ki unhen bhi ek chance mili
 They believe that their chance is also ruined due to a system like CSAT
 is saal jab jammu-kashmir ke chaatro ko upiessi civil sarvice pariksha main baithne ke liye umr seemaa main paanch saal kii chhot di gai to phir se ye chaatr ashanvit ho gaye or baichaiyn bhi
 They say that when CM Mahmuba Mufti's efforts can give them exemption, then why are we not getting them
 shaayad ye chaatr hindu-muslim dibet ke naam par tivi ne kashmir ko jis tarah se pesh kiya or ye uske graahak bane ab thage hue se mahasoos kar rahe hai
 We do not know what the UPSC will decide, but if these students feel that they will be done with a lift in prime time, then it is right
 in chaatro ko ek sawaal khud se bhi poochna chahie jab duusari parikshaon ke chaatr pradarshan karte hai to kya ve unamem jate hai, unke dukhon se unhen takalif hoti he, agar sawaal kaa jawaab naa main he to prime time main bhi uthaane se kuch nahin hoga
 i pray that they get a chance
 guzarish karuunga ki hindu muslim dibet band karaane main sakriy bhoomika adaa karen varna wo javaani javaani nahin jisaki koi kahani nahin vaala gaanaa sunanaa padegaa
 You are watching the 19th issue of the Job Series
 central bank aaf india ne abhi tak 700 se adhik chaatro ko jwining letters nahin diya he jabaki pariksha paas kiye hue saal biit gaye hai
 You tell me, more than 700 students have passed the exam, many have left the job after getting in the merit list, now they are not getting joining letter for 11 months
 kya aapako nahin lagata ki politicil phixing vaale match se kahin zyaada ye badi khabar he
 Change your taste and preference for news, otherwise you are going to be cheated a lot
 elahabaad main uttar pradesh lok seva ayog kaa daftar he, iske saamne chaatro ne pichley shuukravaar ko pradarshan kiya
 These students are engineers
 sahaayak ejeeniyar or junior ejeeniyar kii bhartee ke liye 2013 main likhit pariksha hui thi
 JE had 3222 posts and Assistant Engineer had 952 posts
 vigyaapan niklaa 2013 main, likhit pariksha hui teen saal baad 11-12 april 2016 ko
 The written examination of JE took place on 22-23 May 2016
 iske baad se do saal biit gaya magar riselt nahin aayaa he
 On 11 December 2017, these youths demonstrated in front of the Commission and received written assurance that on February 15, the results of Assistant Engineer and Junior Engineer will be out in April
 15 farvari ko bhasma hue 11 din ho gaye hai
 It may be in India only that the result of the 2013 examination has not come till February 2018
 tabhi main kahata hum bharat ke naujavaanon ko kaaphi badha chadha kar pesh kiya jaataa he jabaki inaki polytical quality bahut karaab he
 If it was not bad, such a fraud would not happen to them in every state
 meri baat buree lag sakati he magar ve khud se check kar len meri hi baat sahi lagegi
 Students with physical challenges came to meet our colleague Manish Kumar in Patna
 inhone jo haal bataaya wo sunakar aap behaal ho jaaenge
 In 2010, these people passed the exam and were selected for various posts
 inaki sankhya 49 he
 He joined but after eight months, the Bihar Staff Selection Commission removed him from the job
 thik usee tarah jaise jharkhand main daaroga kii do saal kii training dekar, jwining kara kar unhen naukari se hataa diya gaya
 The reason given was that the disability reservation has not been properly followed
 is pariksha kaa vigyaapan 2010 main niklaa tha, teen saal baad 24 agast 2013 ko riselt aayaa tha
 He was employed from January 2014 to August 2014 but was later removed
 inhen prime time kii naukari series se ummid ho gai he ki shaayad sarkaar sun le
 You must be wondering if there is a court in this country
 bilkul adaalat he or patna hoicourt ne 20 agast 2015 ko order bhi diya tha ki in 49 viklangon ko phir se behaal kiya jaae
 Restoration has not yet taken place
 ye dobaaraa hoicourt gaye or disambar 2016 main phir se hai court ne kaha ki inaki bahaali ho
 But it did not happen
 aapako lagata he ki hoicourt ke do do adeshon se jab kisi ko fark nahin padaa to prime time se fark padegaa
 The comments hamane naukari series kii shuruyaat staff salection kamishan kii pariksha se kii thi
 In the last episode, we mentioned that 353 youths were waiting for the letter to join the postal department of Maharashtra Circle
 hamane prime time kii naukari siries ke 17wein ank main maharashtra cirkil par jor diya tha
 Today the news of posting on the website of Maharashtra Circle has arrived
 353 naujavaanon ko bataa diya gaya he ki kiski posting kis branch or shahar main hogi
 It is also a pleasure for us
 agar ek sho se 353 chaatro ke jivan par asar pad saktaa he to naukari series may kii jagah july tak karuunga
 Can not the youth of our India achieve an honest examination system, if we intend, we will also achieve it
 staff salection kamishan kii pariksha sijiel 2016 ke chaatro ke liye bhi ek khushkhabari he
 We had also raised the question of this examination that the joining letter is not being given to the youth who have passed
 iskar vibhaag kii sanstha sibiditi ke liye 1114 padon ke liye pariksha paas kar jwining kaa intazaar kar rahe the
 It was also mentioned in the first episode
 aath maheene baad ab chitthee milegi
 Those who have been appointed to the post of Income Tax Inspector are instructed to elect their place of choice and submit the form
 chaliye ye bhi puch rahe honge ki holi kab he, kab he holi
 
 
 On February 26, about 30 women performing in front of the Uttarakhand Chief Minister's house were caught and taken to the bus
 un sabake paas nursing main diploma he
 On March 15, 2016, two years before today, an advertisement for 440 female health workers in Uttarakhand was released
 300 or 600 kii fees jamaa kar 6600 se zyada eenem diploma dhari mahilaon ne aavedan kiya
 When the new government came, the category changed
 kaha gaya ki 440 padon par unheen nursing diploma waalon ko mauka milegaa jinhone 12veen main science padhaa he
 Now, with this one decision, 5500 women were dropped out who had studied 12th Arts
 jabaki in mahilaon ne uttarakhand sarkaar se manyata praapt sarkari or privet nursing college se padhane ke liye teen saal main teen se chaar lakh rupee kharch kiye hai
 At that time the government should have made a policy that women passing Arts will not be able to get a nursing degree
 sarkari nursing college main bhi arts or science donon se grajuation karne vaali mahilaon nursing kar sakati hai
 Then why this division in giving jobs
 bahaali kii prakriya ko vivaadit bana dena koi ranneeti lagati he taaki isi main cese mukadmaa hota rahe or time cat jaae
 Did not get a job, now these girls are demonstrating, fighting the case by raising money
 yahi nahin foresti guard, udyaan vibhaag, van nigam kii bhariyon main bhi science or arts kaa bantwaaraa kar diya gaya he
 The unemployed are divided in the same way, what can be better than these conditions
 tata institute of soshal sciensez main paanch dinon se chaatr pradarshan kar rahe hai
 Demonstrations are going on not only in the Mumbai campus but also in the remaining three campuses of Tissus
 prashasan ke saath baithak to hui magar samaadhaan nahin niklaa he
 Will you ever meet the students of Tis, their quality is very good, not only are they qualified in studies, these students have also done amazing work in social service
 par ye pradarshan isliye kar rahe hai kyonki anusuchit jati, janajati or obisi ke chaatro ko milane vaali chaatravrutti kii suvidha bharat sarkaar ne waapas le lee he
 TIS has issued an order that the students of the 2016-18, 2017-19 batch pay tuition fees, hostel fees and dining fees
 in chaatro ko post metric scolership kii suvidha mil rahi thi jo ab band ho gai he
 According to the media report, the Tis administration says that the scholarship has not been withheld
 indian express kii priyanka sahu se baat karne hue tis prashasan ne kaha he ki santhaan apane str par sansaadhan jutaney kaa prayaas kar rahaa he
 This is strange logic
 jab sarkaar scolership de rahi thi to wo milani chahie
 Now i will mention a problem that i do not know the solution for
 saansad se lekar chaatro ne kai baar upiessi se kaha magar inkaa samaadhaan nahin hota
 Whenever the form of UPSC comes out, these students get restless in the hope of being given a chance
 taminladu or kerala se bhi chaatro ne sampark kiya tab laga ki baat rakh dete hai
 You know that in 2011, CSAT was applied in UPSC preliminary examination
 ise lekar khub sawaal uthe or bavaal hua
 The students said that the new system is in such a way that students of science, engineering and English medium benefit
 arts ke chaatr peeche rah jaaenge or hindi madhyam ke chaatro ko nuksaan ho
 Once the movement of the CSAT had caught vigor, big leaders came in support of them
 29 janvari 2018 ko upiessi ke saamne chaatro ne pradarshan kiya tha
 In 2015, the government removed CSAT from the qualifying round
 sarkaar ne yah bhi faisla kiya ki jin chaatro ne 2011 main pehali baar upiessi kii pariksha di thi unhen ek baar or pariksha dene kaa mauka diya jayega
 But in 2012-13, 2013-14, the students who suffered loss due to CSAT want to get a chance
 unka maananaa he ki sisat jaisi vyavastha ke kaaran unka chance bhi barbaad hua he
 This year, when the students of Jammu and Kashmir were given a five-year relaxation in the age limit to appear in the UPSC Civil Service Examination, these students were again hopeful and restless
 inkaa kahana he ki jab siem mahamuba mufti ke prayaas se inhen chhot mil sakati he to hamen kyon nahin mil rahi he
 Perhaps these students are feeling cheated by the way TV presented Kashmir in the name of hindu-muslim debate and they became its customers
 ham nahin jaanate ki upiessi kya faisla legi lekin agar in chaatro ko yahi lagata he ki prime time main uthaa dene bhar se unka kaam ho jayega to yahi sahi
 These students should also ask a question to themselves when the students of other examinations perform, do they go in them, their sorrow hurts them, if the question is not answered then even in prime time, nothing will be done
 
 dua karuunga ki inhen ek chance mil jaae
 i would request that Hindu Muslims play an active role in closing the debate or else they are not young people, who will have to listen to a song with no story
 aap dekh rahe hai naukari series kaa 19waan ank
 The Central Bank of India has not yet given a joining letter to more than 700 students even though the years have passed
 aap hi bataaiye 700 se adhik chaatr pariksha paas kar chuke hai, merit list main aa jane ke baad kaiyon ne naukari chhod di, ab unhen 11 maheene se jwainig letters nahin mil rahaa he
 Don't you think that this is a bigger news than a politically fixing match
 khabaron kaa apana swaad or praathamikta badal lijie varna aapke saath bahut bada dhokhaa hone vaala he balki ho chukaa he

 aap soch rahe honge ki is desh main adaalat he yaa nahin
 Absolutely the court is there and the Patna High Court also ordered on August 20, 2015 that these 49 handicapped be reinstated
 abhi tak bahaali nahin hui he
 He again went to the High Court and in December 2016 again the High Court said that he should be reinstated
 magar nahin hui
 Do you think that when no one is affected by two orders of the High Court, prime time will matter
 tippaniyan We started the job series with the Staff Selection Commission exam
 pichley episod main hamane zikr kiya tha ki maharashtra cirkil ke postal vibhaag se jwining ke liye 353 noujvaan chitthee kaa intazaar kar rahe the
 We had emphasized Maharashtra Circle in the 17th issue of the Prime Time Job Series
 aaj maharashtra cirkil kii website par posting kii khabar aa gai he
 353 youth have been told whose posting will be in which branch and city
 yah hamaare liye bhi khushi kii baat he
 If a show can affect the lives of 353 students, then i will do the job series by July instead of May
 kya hamaare bharat ke noujvaan ek eemaandaar pariksha vyavastha nahin hasil kar sakate hai, iraadaa kar lenge to hasil bhi kar lenge
 Staff Selection Commission exam is also a good news for the students of CGL 2016
 hamane is pariksha kaa bhi sawaal uthaaya tha ki paas kar chuke naujavaanon ko jwining letters nahin diya ja rahaa he
 The CBDT, an institution of Income Tax Department, was waiting for joining by passing the examination for 1114 posts
 pehle episod main bhi iskaa zikr kiya tha
 After eight months, you will get the letter now
 inakam tex inspector ke pad par jinaki niyukti hui he unhen nirdesh diya jaataa he ve apni pasand kii jagah paane ke liye chunaav karen or farm jamaa karen
 Let us also be asking when is Holi, when is Holi
 
 
 ab ek aisi samasya kaa zikr hoga jiskaa samaadhaan mujhe pataa nahin
 Students from MP to UPSC have told UPSC many times but these are not resolved
 jab bhi upiessi kaa farm nikalataa he ye chaatr ek chance die jane kii ummid main baichaiyn ho uthte hai
 Students from Tamil Nadu and Kerala also contacted, then felt that they would keep the talk
 aap jaanate hai ki 2011 main upiessi kii praarambhik pariksha main sisat lagu kiya gaya tha
 a lot of questions arose and caused ruckus
 chaatro kaa kahana tha ki nai pranali is tarah se he ki science, ejineering or angrezi madhyam ke chaatro ko phayda ho
 Arts students will be left behind and Hindi medium students may suffer
 sisat kaa andolan ne ek baar jor pakadaa tha tab bade bade netaa inke samarthan main aae the
 The students performed in front of UPSC on 29 January 2018
 2015 main sarkaar ne sisat ko qualifing round se hataa diya
 The government also decided that the students who had appeared for the UPSC for the first time in 2011, would be given the chance to take the exam one more time
 lekin 2012-13, 2013-14 main jin chaatro ko sisat ke kaaran nuksaan hua wo chaahate hai ki unhen bhi ek chance mili
 They believe that their chance is also ruined due to a system like CSAT
 is saal jab jammu-kashmir ke chaatro ko upiessi civil sarvice pariksha main baithne ke liye umr seemaa main paanch saal kii chhot di gai to phir se ye chaatr ashanvit ho gaye or baichaiyn bhi
 They say that when CM Mahmuba Mufti's efforts can give them exemption, then why are we not getting them
 shaayad ye chaatr hindu-muslim dibet ke naam par tivi ne kashmir ko jis tarah se pesh kiya or ye uske graahak bane ab thage hue se mahasoos kar rahe hai
 We do not know what the UPSC will decide, but if these students feel that they will be done with a lift in prime time, then it is right
 in chaatro ko ek sawaal khud se bhi poochna chahie jab duusari parikshaon ke chaatr pradarshan karte hai to kya ve unamem jate hai, unke dukhon se unhen takalif hoti he, agar sawaal kaa jawaab naa main he to prime time main bhi uthaane se kuch nahin hoga
 i pray that they get a chance
 guzarish karuunga ki hindu muslim dibet band karaane main sakriy bhoomika adaa karen varna wo javaani javaani nahin jisaki koi kahani nahin vaala gaanaa sunanaa padegaa
 You are watching the 19th issue of the Job Series
 central bank aaf india ne abhi tak 700 se adhik chaatro ko jwining letters nahin diya he jabaki pariksha paas kiye hue saal biit gaye hai
 You tell me, more than 700 students have passed the exam, many have left the job after getting in the merit list, now they are not getting joining letter for 11 months
 kya aapako nahin lagata ki politicil phixing vaale match se kahin zyaada ye badi khabar he
 Change your taste and preference for news, otherwise you are going to be cheated a lot
 elahabaad main uttar pradesh lok seva ayog kaa daftar he, iske saamne chaatro ne pichley shuukravaar ko pradarshan kiya
 These students are engineers
 sahaayak ejeeniyar or junior ejeeniyar kii bhartee ke liye 2013 main likhit pariksha hui thi
 JE had 3222 posts and Assistant Engineer had 952 posts
 vigyaapan niklaa 2013 main, likhit pariksha hui teen saal baad 11-12 april 2016 ko
 The written examination of JE took place on 22-23 May 2016
 iske baad se do saal biit gaya magar riselt nahin aayaa he
 On 11 December 2017, these youths demonstrated in front of the Commission and received written assurance that on February 15, the results of Assistant Engineer and Junior Engineer will be out in April
 15 farvari ko bhasma hue 11 din ho gaye hai
 It may be only in India that the result of the 2013 examination has not come till February 2018
 tabhi main kahata hum bharat ke naujavaanon ko kaaphi badha chadha kar pesh kiya jaataa he jabaki inaki polytical quality bahut karaab he
 If it was not bad, such a fraud would not happen to them in every state
 meri baat buree lag sakati he magar ve khud se check kar len meri hi baat sahi lagegi
 Students with physical challenges came to meet our colleague Manish Kumar in Patna
 inhone jo haal bataaya wo sunakar aap behaal ho jaaenge
 In 2010, these people passed the exam and were selected for various posts
 inaki sankhya 49 he
 He joined but after eight months, the Bihar Staff Selection Commission removed him from the job
 thik usee tarah jaise jharkhand main daaroga kii do saal kii training dekar, jwining kara kar unhen naukari se hataa diya gaya
 The reason given was that the disability reservation has not been properly followed
 is pariksha kaa vigyaapan 2010 main niklaa tha, teen saal baad 24 agast 2013 ko riselt aayaa tha
 He was employed from January 2014 to August 2014 but was later removed
 inhen prime time kii naukari series se ummid ho gai he ki shaayad sarkaar sun le
 You must be wondering if there is a court in this country
 bilkul adaalat he or patna hoicourt ne 20 agast 2015 ko order bhi diya tha ki in 49 viklangon ko phir se behaal kiya jaae
 Restoration has not yet taken place
 ye dobaaraa hoicourt gaye or disambar 2016 main phir se hai court ne kaha ki inaki bahaali ho
 But it did not happen
 aapako lagata he ki hoicourt ke do do adeshon se jab kisi ko fark nahin padaa to prime time se fark padegaa
 The comments hamane naukari series kii shuruyaat staff salection kamishan kii pariksha se kii thi
 In the last episode, we mentioned that 353 youths were waiting for the letter to join the postal department of Maharashtra Circle
 hamane prime time kii naukari siries ke 17wein ank main maharashtra cirkil par jor diya tha
 Today the news of posting on the website of Maharashtra Circle has arrived
 353 naujavaanon ko bataa diya gaya he ki kiski posting kis branch or shahar main hogi
 It is also a pleasure for us
 agar ek sho se 353 chaatro ke jivan par asar pad saktaa he to naukari series may kii jagah july tak karuunga
 Can not the youth of our India achieve an honest examination system, if we intend, we will also achieve it
 staff salection kamishan kii pariksha sijiel 2016 ke chaatro ke liye bhi ek khushkhabari he
 We had also raised the question of this examination that the joining letter is not being given to the youth who have passed
 iskar vibhaag kii sanstha sibiditi ke liye 1114 padon ke liye pariksha paas kar jwining kaa intazaar kar rahe the
 It was also mentioned in the first episode
 aath maheene baad ab chitthee milegi
 Those who have been appointed to the post of Income Tax Inspector are instructed to elect their place of choice and submit the form
 chaliye ye bhi puch rahe honge ki holi kab he, kab he holi
 
 
 Once the movement of the CSAT had caught vigor, big leaders came in support of them
 29 janvari 2018 ko upiessi ke saamne chaatro ne pradarshan kiya tha
 In 2015, the government removed CSAT from the qualifying round
 sarkaar ne yah bhi faisla kiya ki jin chaatro ne 2011 main pehali baar upiessi kii pariksha di thi unhen ek baar or pariksha dene kaa mauka diya jayega
 But in 2012-13, 2013-14, the students who suffered loss due to CSAT want to get a chance
 unka maananaa he ki sisat jaisi vyavastha ke kaaran unka chance bhi barbaad hua he
 This year, when the students of Jammu and Kashmir were given a five-year relaxation in the age limit to appear in the UPSC Civil Service Examination, these students were again hopeful and restless
 inkaa kahana he ki jab siem mahamuba mufti ke prayaas se inhen chhot mil sakati he to hamen kyon nahin mil rahi he
 Perhaps these students are feeling cheated by the way TV presented Kashmir in the name of hindu-muslim debate and they became its customers
 ham nahin jaanate ki upiessi kya faisla legi lekin agar in chaatro ko yahi lagata he ki prime time main uthaa dene bhar se unka kaam ho jayega to yahi sahi
 These students should also ask a question to themselves when the students of other examinations perform, do they go in them, their sorrow hurts them, if the question is not answered then even in prime time, nothing will be done
 
 dua karuunga ki inhen ek chance mil jaae
 i would request that Hindu Muslims play an active role in closing the debate or else they are not young people, who will have to listen to a song with no story
 aap dekh rahe hai naukari series kaa 19waan ank
 The Central Bank of India has not yet given a joining letter to more than 700 students even though the years have passed
 aap hi bataaiye 700 se adhik chaatr pariksha paas kar chuke hai, merit list main aa jane ke baad kaiyon ne naukari chhod di, ab unhen 11 maheene se jwainig letters nahin mil rahaa he
 Don't you think that this is a bigger news than a politically fixing match
 khabaron kaa apana swaad or praathamikta badal lijie varna aapke saath bahut bada dhokhaa hone vaala he balki ho chukaa he
 Allahabad has an Uttar Pradesh Public Service Commission office, in front of which students demonstrated last Friday
 ye chaatr ejeeniyar hai
 There was a written examination in 2013 for the recruitment of Assistant Engineer and Junior Engineer
 jei ke 3222 pad the or assistant ejeeniyar ke 952 pad the
 The advertisement came out in 2013, after three years of written examination on 11-12 April 2016
 jei kii likhit pariksha hui 22-23 may 2016 ko
 Two years have passed since then, but the results have not come
 11 disambar 2017 ko ayog ke saamne in naujavaanon ne pradarshan kiya to likhit aashwaasan mila ki 15 farvari ko assitant ejeeniyar or april main junior ejeeniyar kaa riselt nikaal denge
 It has been 11 days consumed on 15 February
 yah bharat desh main hi ho saktaa he ki 2013 kii pariksha kaa parinaam farvari 2018 tak nahin aayaa he
 That is why i say that the youth of India are very exaggerated while their political quality is very poor
 karaab na hoti to is tarah kii thagi unke saath har rajya main nahin hoti
 My words may seem bad, but they check themselves, my words will be correct
 patna main hamaare sahyogi manish kumaar se shaareerik chunautiyon vaale chaatr milane aae
 You will be disturbed after listening to what they told
 2010 main ye log pariksha paas kar vibhinn padon ke liye chune gaye the
 Their number is 49
 inhone jwine to kiya magar aath maheene baad bihar karmchaaree chayan ayog ne naukari se hataa diya
 In the same way, he was removed from his job by joining the jail in Jharkhand after two years of training
 kaaran bataaya gaya ki viklaangata aarakshan kaa sahi paalan nahin hua he
 The advertisement for this examination was released in 2010, the result came on 24 August 2013 after three years

 The court had on February 13 convicted the three accused
 yah maamla bhi nirbhaya cond jaisaa hi vahashiana he

 The reason is that the police of the capital did not even have a car to go out to find the miscreants
 idhar, jitna vaqt guzar rahaa tha, agava kii gai ladki ke saath jyaadati badhati ja rahi thi
 After picking up Kiran, the crook took him in a car and went from Delhi to Haryana via internal routes

 teenon main se ek muda or gaadi se lohe kaa paanaa or jaik nikaal laayaa or inhen aujaaron se unhone ladki ke sir par kai zordaar waar kiye
 From the very first girl, the girl started falling on the ground and started suffering but the boys did not feel sorry for her
 iske baad unhone ek ke baad ek us par naa sirf kai waar kiye, balki uski laash ko jala kar badashakl karne ke liye gaadi ke silencer se aujaaron ko garm kar use jagah-jagah daaga
 But that situation was still awaited
 iske baad ladakon ne bear kii bottle phodi or usase ladki ke puri jism ko tab tak katate rahe, jab tak wo bejaan nahin ho gai
 The confession of the boys themselves in front of the police says that they did many assaults for peace even after his death and then left the corpse on the spot and escaped
 lekin aakhirkaar, police ko unki car kii mek or mobile phone kii lokation kii badaulat pehle subut mili or doshiyon ko dhar dabocha gaya

 a body of former officers of forces like CRPF, BSF, ITBP, CISF and SSB staged a sit-in at Jantar Mantar in Delhi over their demands
 in ritair adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki ye log pichley ek dashak se bhi adhik samay se in maangon ke puraa hone ke intjaar main hai, lekin abat k kuch nahin hua

 Yechury said, 'we will decide on the basis of policies and programs
 
 Because simply coming together does not mean solidarity (of opposition), it is not just arithmetic
 or meraa maananaa he ki (2019 main) ek vaikalpik sarkaar, ek dharmanirpeksh sarkaar honi chahie
 He said, 'we are not saying that we will shake hands with anyone
 main jo baat uthaanaa chahta hum, vah yah he ki ham sampradayik shaktiyon kii sarkaar ke khilaaf ek vaikalpik sarkaar banane par kaam karenge
 ' makapa mahasachiv ne patrakaron ke saath baatcheet main in sawaalon kaa jawaab de rahe the ki vah 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav tak ubharate rashtriya raajnneetik paridrishy ko kis tarah dekhte hai
 Yechury, who recently met Bihar Chief Minister and JDU President Nitish Kumar, said that although there was a discussion on the grand alliance experiment that removed BJP from power in Bihar, there could be no pre-determined answer to it
 is baat par jor dete hue ki isamen vam dal apane dam par nirnaayak bhoomika nibhaayenge, yechuri ne kaha, 'isliye, hamane unase (nitish) kaha ki uttar bhi vigat main he jo ham dekh chuke hai, 1996 kii sthiti
 That is also an answer
 hamaara itihaas aapako batayega
 After the elections in the year 1996, the Janata Dal, Samajwadi Party, DMK, TDP, AGP, All India Congress (tiwari), four Left parties, Tamil Manila Congress, National Conference and Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party formed a united front government of 13 parties
 makapa netaa ne kaha, 'vimudrikaran sahit modi sarkaar kii nitiyon ko lekar pehle se hi kaaphi asantosh he
 We have to see how to take advantage of this discontent so as to ensure the emergence of an alternative secular coalition
 ' unhone rekhaankit kiya ki bhaajapa is samay keval 31 pratishat maton ke saath satta main he
 Including the votes of its coalition partners, the figure goes up slightly by 37 percent
 iskaa matlab he ki 62 se 63 pratishat logon ne unke khilaaf vot diya he
 ' bhaajapa ko baahar rakhane ke liye congress yaa trinmul congress se gathbandhan karne ke bare main puche jane par yechuri ne kaha ki chunavi raajnneeti main 'pehle se tay koi uttar' uplabdh nahin he or dalon ko chunaavon main logon dwaara die gaye parinaam ke aadhaar par jawaab dena hota he
 He said that it also depends on the policies and programs of the parties and the current situation at any particular time
 yechuri ne kaha, 'hamen dekhnaa hoga ki kis tarah kii sthiti hoti he
 
 hamen sthiti ke aadhaar par hi kaam karnaa hoga
 But by 2019, a lot of water will have flowed into the Ganges
 ' unhone modi sarkaar kii nitiyon ko 'jan virdohi' qaraar dete hue us par sansad ke mahatv ko kam karne kaa aarope lagaaya
 The comments yechuri ne sansadeey loktantr ke prati pradhanmantri kii patibaddhta par sawaal uthaaya or un par rajyasabha (jahaan rajg alpamat main he) kii andekhi karne ke liye vyavastha se 'chhedchhad' kaa aarope lagaaya
 He alleged that the government brings 'every other bill as money bill' so that it does not need approval from the upper house
 makapa netaa ko lagata he ki yah chalan sansadeey vidhiyon ke saath 'khilwaad' he
 In a conversation with reporters, the CPI (M) General Secretary was answering questions on how he sees the emerging national political scenario till the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 haal main bihar ke mukhyamantri evam jadyu adhyaksh nitish kumaar se mulaakaat karne vaale yechuri ne kaha ki haalanki bihar main bhaajapa ko satta se dur karne vaale mahagathbandhan prayog par baatcheet hui, lekin iskaa koi pehle se tay uttar nahin ho saktaa
 Emphasizing that the Left parties would play a decisive role on its own, Yechury said, 'therefore, we told him (nitish) that the answer is also in the past what we have seen, 1996 situation
 vah bhi ek uttar he
 Our history will tell you
 ' varsh 1996 main chunaavon ke baad janata dal, samaajawaadee party, dramuk, tedepa, agap, ol india congress (tiwari), chaar vam dalon, tamil manilla congress, neshnal conference or maharashtravaadi gomantak party ne 13 dalon kii sanyukt morcha sarkaar banaai thi
 The CPI (M) leader said, "there is already a lot of dissatisfaction with the policies of the Modi government, including demonetization
 hamen dekhnaa hoga ki is asantosh kaa phayda kaise uthaaya jaae jisase ki ek vaikalpik dharmanirpeksh gathbandhan kaa ubharna sunishchit ho sake
 He underlined that the BJP is currently in power with only 31 percent votes
 iske gathbandhan sahyogiyon ko mili maton ko milakar aankada 37 pratishat se thodaa upar jaataa he
 This means that 62 to 63 percent of the people have voted against him
 ' When asked about an alliance with the Congress or Trinamool Congress to keep the BJP out, Yechury said that in electoral politics 'no pre-determined answers' are available and the parties have to respond based on the results given by the people in elections Have to give
 unhone kaha ki yah dalon kii nitiyon or kaaryakramon tathaa kisi vishesh samay main maujuuda sthiti par bhi nirbhar karata he
 Yechury said, 'we have to see what kind of situation happens
 
 We have to work based on the situation
 lekin 2019 tak ganga main kaaphi pani bah chukaa hoga
 He termed the policies of the Modi government as 'anti-people' and accused him of undermining the importance of Parliament
 tippaniyan Yechury questioned the Prime Minister's commitment to parliamentary democracy and accused him of 'tampering' with the system to ignore the Rajya Sabha (where the NDA is in the minority)
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki sarkaar 'har duusare vidheyak ko dhan vidheyak' ke rup main laati he jisase use ucch sadan se manjuuri kii aavashyaktaa naa pade

 aakhirkaar kaatil kuldeep he yaa koi or? iskaa pataa aapako film dekhakar hi chalegaa
 Review: Not Khilji, the story of the might of the Rajputs is Bhansali's 'padmavat' story of a weak episode is good but the screenplay is quite messy
 baar-baar pregent or flashbek ko darshane ke chakkar main mekars aapke dhyaan ko bahut bhatkaate hai

 kahani bhatki hui najar aati he
 The story of the film could have been accurate and crispy
 film kuldeep patwaal ke naam par aadhaarit he lekin filmakan ke dauraan is kirdaar ke saath nyaay nahin ho pataa
 This character needed to be given more attention
 ek badhiya kahani, ek umdaa film main tabdeel hote-hote rah gayi
 After all, why can you watch the film, Deepak Dobriyal has played a very different character in the film
 deepak ne apane kirdaar ko behtareen tareeke se nibhaayaa he
 Rayma Sen could have acted better
 praveen dabaas, anuraag aroda, jameel khan ne bhi bahut hi sahaj abhinay kiya he
 Gulshan Devaiah has revived his character and appears to be acting very natural while talking in Punjabi
 acchhee baat ye bhi he ki film main koi bhi jabardastee ke gane nahin hai
 Direction is good

 is bare main party alaakaman ko bhi bataa diya gaya he ki, ranneetik chook ke chalate hi party ko baikfoot par aana pad gaya
 Being agreeable to a PM debate in Rajya Sabha, according to a large section of the party, a section of the party believes that the issue of Kashmir had been debated earlier in the Rajya Sabha in this session itself, so without the Prime Minister's reply for the last debate, the party Getting ready was a strategic lapse

 to nahin hoti ye halatsutron kaa kahana he ki, naaraaz netaaon ne haikaman ko bataaya ki, agar piem sansad main main baluchistan kaa zikr karte to unako vahin gheraa ja saktaa tha
 The PM could have been attacked by the Congress saying, what is new in this, during the UPA government, PM Manmohan Singh also mentioned, what concrete steps will you take in today's situation
 saath hi party ye bhi yaad dilaa sakati thi ki, upie ke vaqt jab baluchistan kaa zikr hua tab bijepi ke netaa kitne hamalavar hue the, un bayanon ko yaad dilaayaa ja saktaa tha or bijepi se poocha ja saktaa he tha ki, kya usne stand badla he
 Now what do you regret when 
 
 
 But now Congress is stuck on this issue

 If this does not happen, just think why would a monk open 800 bank accounts? How will about four thousand crore rupees come out of these accounts? Why will foreign currency transactions of more than two hundred crores? You have a little glimpse of the wealth of the father and son, otherwise the wealth figure is going up to ten thousand crores or even more
 baat ambani yaa bill gates kii nahin ho rahi he or naa hi duniya ke baaki raison kii
 Asaram Bapu and his son Narayan Sai have been showing the path of salvation to the devotees wearing Baba's cloak for years
 moh-maaya ke bare main gyaan dete aae hai, baap-bete kii is jodi ne aisa gul khilaayaa or aisa chakkar chalaaya ki daulat bhi donon ke jhaanse main aakar unheen ke ghar main barasati rahi
 As if the treasure of Kubera had come out from the same room of Asaram

 While the ashram and home of his Baba and his son are in many states and cities in the country
 jab un kamaron kaa darwaja khulegaa to ye 9-10 hajaar karod pataa nahin kahaan ja pahonchega?dhanna seth baap-bete kaa kuber kaa ye khajaana yun hi saamne nahin aayaa
 In fact, Surat police raided his ashram in Ahmedabad in October during Narayan Sai's absconding
 tab chaape ke dauraan uske ek kamare se kul 42 boriyaan kagajaat, chah computer or ek sipiu mila tha
 The papers were so much that the investigation took more than two months
 lekin ek baar jaise hi boriyon se mili kagajaat or computer main chupa raaj baahar aayaa to surat police bhi hairaan rah gai
 a monk has so much wealth? Which only takes more than two months to count and understand? And the amazing thing is that the count is not even completed
 aap soch bhi nahin sakate in logon ne paise se paise banane ke liye un paison ko kahaan-kahaan invest kiya? bas aap naam sochate jaaie, inkaa investment vahiin milegaa
 The father and son, who gave the knowledge of others to stay away from temptation, invested everywhere in order to secure their future
 itnaa hi nahin baap-bete ke bank khaaton ne ye raaj bhi kholaa ki ye logon ko lone par paise dete the
 If there was a profit in the business from that money, then apart from Sood, i would have taken part in that profit as well
 baat sirf invenstment yaa lone tak nahin he
 The papers that the sacks sprung up and the secrets that the computer opened opened the eyes of the police
 kyonki ab jo sach baahar aayaa tha wo vaaki baap-bete kii chaalaaki kii pole khol rahaa tha
 The accounts received by the father and son of the police clearly show that both were sages as well as excellent businessmen
 logon ko lone par paise dete or phir us paise par sood ke saath-saath bijness main laabh hota to usamen bhi hissaa lete the
 According to the police, after the property has been received from the father-son, now many agencies of the country will ask for accounts from both together
 baap-bete ne chah computer ke andar kareeb-kareeb puraa bank khol rakhaa tha
 These computers mentioned about eight hundred accounts of almost all banks in the country
 tamaam khate asaram or narayan sai ke kareebi rishtedaaron, sevak or saadhakon ke naam par hai
 However these accounts would have been used only for Asaram and Narayan Sai
 bank khaaton kii jaanch karne par pataa chalaa ki in khaaton se ab tak kareeb saadhe teen hajaar se chaar hajaar karod ke bich paise nikaale yaa jamaa kiye gaye hai
 The most shocking thing that the police found in checking accounts and papers was the foreign currency transactions
 bakaul police kagajaat sabit karte hai ki baap-bete ne kareeb-kareeb do sau karod kii videshi mudra kaa bhi her-pher kiya he
 According to the Surat Police, the father and son have the most property as land
 isaki keemat kaa abhi sahi andaja bhi nahin lagaaya ja saktaa
 Because these lands are in Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and unknown areas
 police ke mutabik zyaadaatar jameen yaa to benami he yaa phir jinaki jameen he unhen bhram main rakhkar unase lee gai he
 According to the police, land documents have been sent to the concerned department for investigation
 ab vahi ye pataa lagaaegi ki jis vakt jameen kharidi gai or ab uski kya keemat hogi

 It is believed that these 13 people were unfaithful and it was because of them that such a big incident happened with Lord Jesus
 is din ko lekar ek or baat he
 Which is discussed a lot
 roman catholic carch ke pope, france ke raja ke saath milakar ek mathvaasi sainya aadesh ko sajaa sunaate hai
 Who was known as the Knights Templar and their leader ordered to be crucified along with being tortured
 yahi nahin manyata he ki jisas ko shuukravaar ke din hi suuli par chadhaaya gaya tha
 Because of this, if 13th date and Friday are ever met then they create bad luck
 america ke log to is taarikh or din ke milan ko lekar kaaphi darate hai
 Even the help of many psychologists is taken
 isi tarah shuukravaar kii 13 taarikh ko dheron ghatnaayen huin hai
 However, we would say that these are all things of superstition and hence there is nothing to fear
 vaise bhi kisi bhi vyakti kii jindagi main kuch na kuch hota hi rata he, kabhi acha to kabhi bura

 modi ke bayaan ko lekar paidaa hue vivaad ke bare main puche jane par nitish kumaar ne kaha, 'devalayas se pehle shauchalay' vaale naare main kuch bhi nayaa nahin he
 We have used such slogans before
 bihar ne in muddon par aage badhkar kaam kiya he
 In fact, in a program of youth in Delhi, Narendra Modi had said that there should be toilets in the country first, then the temple
 unke is bayaan ke baad siyasatdanon ke bich bayanon kaa daur chal padaa tha
 The VHP even called it an insult to Hinduism
 haalanki unki party ab tak modi kaa bachaav karti rahi he
 At the same time, when asked about the allegations of fodder scam, Nitish said that even before that his name has been dragged into the fodder scam
 unhen nahin pataa ki aisa kab tak hota rahegaa
 Let us tell you that Nitish Kumar was accused by a fodder scam accused of giving Rs 1 crore

 In the Aaj tak-org survey, people have expressed their opinion with respect to Anna Hazare and his Jan Lokpal
 anna hajaare ne ek baar phir kar diya he bhrashtachar ke khilaaf elaan-e-jang
 Anna Hazare will again go on hunger strike from August 16 for a strong Lokpal, but is the country with this declaration
 kya desh anna ke anshan ke liye taiyaar he? sarkaar ke lokapal bill ke bare main desh kii janata kya sochati he? anna ke anshan se thik pehle ajtak ne ek ahm survey kiya he
 Aaj Tak has taken constipation from the people of the country

 Anna Hazare proclaims that he will start a fast on the issue of Lokpal
 ye anshan tab tak jari rahegaa, jab tak sarkaar unki maange nahin maanati
 The government does not give confidence to create an ombudsman, so that the country can get rid of the stigma of corruption, the country can be truly free from corruption

 Only the people of Ahmedabad and Patna gave less support to Anna's demand to place the Prime Minister under the purview of Lokpal

 Should the higher judiciary ie the higher judiciary be under the purview of the Lokpal? In response, 75 per cent of the people said yes, and 17 per cent said no and 8 per cent did not give any opinion
 haalanki is sawaal par bhi ahmedabad or patna ke logon ne haa or naa ke jawaab ko lagbhag baraabar samarthan diya, lekin dilli ke logon ne ucch nyaaypalika ko lokapal ke daayre main laane kii purajor vakaalat kii
 3
 kya saansadon or sansadeey samitiyon ko lokapal ke daayre main hona chahie?is sawaal ke jawaab main bhi anna hajaare group kii maang ko jabardast samarthan dikhaa
 80 per cent of the people answered yes, while only 9 per cent said no and 11 per cent had no opinion
 aglaa sawaal sarkari afasaron, adhikariyon main faile bhrashtachar se judaa tha
 In the government bill, big bureaucrats are placed under the ambit of Lokpal but not the entire bureaucracy
 4
 Should the entire bureaucracy be under the purview of the Lokpal? The answer to this question came in the same way, the kind of demands Anna Hazare is making in the Lokpal Bill i
e
 81 percent of the people want the entire bureaucracy to be under the Lokpal's purview
 iske vipaksh main sirf 8 fisadi log the
 In total, the people of the country stamp all four big demands of the Anna Hazare group and reject the government's Lokpal bill
 ajtak-orarji ke survey ke mutabik desh anna ke saath he, lekin sabase khaas baat ye he ki desh kii yuva takat jinke kandhon par desh kaa bhavishya he, aane vaale dinon main jo desh kii bagdor sanbhaalenge wo bhi anna ke saath hai
 In the Aaj tak-org survey on Lokpal, we also tried to know that Anna Hazare is trying to pressure the elected government of the country by showing fear of sitting on hunger strike again, but his fast is supported by the people of the country
 Also or not? Anna Hazare taunts and says that his demand for a strong Lokpal is the demand of the people of the country, but whether the people of the country also think so? 5
 kya bhrashtachar kii adhiktam sajaa umrakaid honi chahie?71 fisadi logon kii raay main haa main he
 Only 15 percent of the people opposing the maximum sentence of life imprisonment of corrupt people, while 14 percent people did not give any opinion on this issue

 6
 kya bhrasht sarkari adhikari kii sari sampatti jabt honi chahie?74 fisadi janata chaahati he ki bhrasht sarkari adhikari kii puri sampatti jabt honi chahie
 Only 14 per cent of the people answered yes to this question and 12 per cent said they did not know
 is sawaal par bhi survey main shaamil tamaam shaharon ke logon kii raay ek jaisi he
 7
 kya sarkaar kaa lokapal bill bhrashtachar se sakhti se nibat paaegaa?is sawaal ke jawaab ne sarkaar kii pole khol di he
 54 percent believe that corruption will not be eliminated by the government's Lokpal bill
 jin logon ne sarkaar ke lokapal bill ko sahi tehraaya he, wo 31 fisadi hi hai jabik 15 fisadi logon ne koi raay nahin di
 However, it is also worth noting in response to this question that those who support the government ombudsman are more than those who oppose the government ombudsman in Bhopal, Hyderabad, Lucknow and Patna
 8
 Does Anna Hazare Group's pressure on the Lokpal on the government reduces the dignity of Parliament and mps? The answer to this question is very shocking
 is sawaal ke jawaab main 60 fisadi logon ne ye kaha ki haa anna hajaare kii team lokapal bill main vishesh praavdhaan karaane ke liye jo sarkaar par dabaav daal rahe hai usase sansad or saansadon kii garima kam hoti he
 Only 21 per cent of the people justified pressuring the government
 19 fisadi logon ne is maamle main koi raay nahin di
 Chennai, Mumbai and Patna have more people who have answered yes
 kahin aisa to nahin desh kii janata anna kii maang kaa samarthan to karti he, lekin chaahati ye he ki jo kaam anna hajaare or unki team kar rahi he, wo janata ke chune hue pratinidhi yani saansad karen
 On the issue of corruption and Lokpal, mps should come out in front
 baharhaal, is ahm masale par desh kii janata ne apni raay de di he
 9
 chune gaye pratinidhi na hone ke baavjood kya anna desh kii janata ke mat kii numaaindgi karte hai?aapako sunakar hairaani hogi ki desh kii 73 fisadi janata maanati he ki haa anna hajaare desh kii janata ke vichaaron kii, janata ke maton kii puri numaaindgi karte hai
 That is, what Anna is saying is the demand of the people of the country
 sirf 13 fisadi logon ne is sawaal kaa jawaab naa main diya auki 14 fisadi logon ne koi raay nahin di
 10
 lokapal par desh kii janata kaa sahi mat anna hajaare vyakt karte hai yaa saansad?desh kii janata kaa jawaab yah he ki sirf 18 fisadi log hi maanate hai unke chune gaye pratinidhi yaani desh kii sarvocch sanstha main baithne vaale saansad desh kii janata kaa mat vyakt karte hai
 In the opinion of 67 per cent people, the demand of Anna Hazare is the demand of the public
 anna hajaare janata kii maang kii sahi numaaindgi karte hai
 11
 kya majboot lokapal ke liye anna hajaare ke anshan kaa samarthan karte hai?77 fisadi janata kii raay main majboot lokapal ke liye anna hajaare kaa anshan karnaa sahi he, 77 fisadi janata anna ke anshan ko samarthan karti he, anna ke anshan ko samarthan nahin dene vaale sirf 13 fisadi hai jabaki 10 fisadi logon ne koi raay nahin di
 In the survey of Aaj tak-org, a total of 4012 people have been consulted in 10 big cities of the country and the results of the survey show that before the storm of Anna, the government should be cautious because the people of the country are with Anna

 Delhi BJP President Manoj Tiwari has lashed out at the head of the Aam Aadmi Party and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, saying that those who do everything incomplete are demanding a full state today and Kejriwal's call to divert attention from misrule Doing political drama
 manoj tiwarine kaha ki dilli kii janata jahaan ek ore in dinompani, bijli kii killat, sarkari aspataalon kii durdasha or dilli sarkaar ke vibhaagon ke bhrashtachar se pareshaan he or usase dhyaan bhatakaane ke liye kejariwal purna rajya ke darje kaa raag alaap rahe hai
 Conspiracy to divert attention from misrule, he alleged that the demand of the Aam Aadmi Party to enter Delhi's full state is a political act of Kejriwal to divert public attention from his misrule and inaction
 dilli kii janata ke hit main sthaneey sarkaar ko kuch adhikaar milane chahie
 Manoj Tiwari alleged that the Arvind Kejriwal government has consistently hurt the federal structure by securing unethical power in 2013 or in 2015, and the intention of this government not to grant full state status to Delhi is unbridled for itself
 To gain power

 He also said that in the same federal structure on which Kejriwal is constantly declaring himself helpless, BJP and Congress have run governments and focused on the development of Delhi, whose picture can be seen as a network of metro and best flyovers
 
 haalanki dilli ko purna rajya ke darje ke liye bijepi taiyaar he yaa nahin, iskaa unhone khud sidhaa-sidhaa jawaab nahin diya or kaha ki kejariwal ko iske liye ol party meet bulani chahie jisamen isaki samiksha kii jaaegi

 Tiwari said that today the power-hungry of the frustrated Aam Aadmi Party and Congress is forcing them to repeat the alliance formed in the 2013 assembly elections but the people of Delhi will not accept them this time

 is bahes se aapako yah nahin pataa chalata ki adhyadesh ko lekar sanvaidhanik sthiti kya he
 In the Indian Express on 6 January, Faizan Mustafa, Vice Chancellor of Nalsar University of Law, wrote an article on the ordinance which, upon passing, suggests that the politics of ordinances should go beyond the Congress BJP
 faizan mustafaa se is bare main lambii baatcheet hui jisase mujhe yah lekh likhane main kaaphi madad mili
 It is true that between 1952 and 2014, the central government has issued 668 ordinances
 lekin sirf yahi ek tathy sahi nahin he
 The ordinance is against democracy
 pehle spikar se lekar supreme court tak sab kah chuke hai
 The condition of the state governments will be worse but due to lack of adequate research, no one has the right data
 agar aap is bahes main dilchaspee rakhte hai or sarkaar bhi gahebgahe adhyadesh ko lekar bhidati rahati he to ab usee ko rajyavar bataanaa chahie ki kis rajya main adhyadesh zyada jari hota he or kis rajya main nahin
 Faizan Mustafa Saheb told me that DC Badhwa of Pune was studying the land laws of Bihar
 usee dauraan unhone dekha ki badi sankhya main kanoon kii jagah adhyadesh ke zariye sarkarein hukumat kar rahi hai
 Wadhwa Sahib started researching ordinances
 unhen pataa chalaa ki 1967 se 1981 ke bich bihar main 256 adhyadesh jari hue jabaki vidhansabha ne 189 kanoon hi banaae
 This was a terrible situation
 itnaa hi nahin 18 janvari 1986 ko bihar ke rajyapal jagannatha kaushal ne ek din main 58 adhyadesh jari kiya tha
 This may be a record in itself, but for this it is important that you also know the status of the ordinances in Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh to Gujarat and Kerala
 tippaniyan Wadhwa Saheb, however, sued the Supreme Court on the basis of his research
 bahes ke baad supreme court ne 1987 main vyavastha di ki jab tak bahut apaat sthiti na ho adhyadesh dobaaraa jari nahin hona chahie
 That is, when an ordinance ends after six months, it should not be issued again
 pichley saal jab modi sarkaar bhoomi adhigrahan adhyadesh laai to uske kilaaf mashhoor vakil indira jaisingh bhi supreme court chalin gayi
 The decision is yet to come
 vaise aap padhanaa chahen to vadhava sahab ne ek kitaab bhi likhi he, Endangered constitutionalism- documents of supreme court case
 Our Constituent Assembly also expressed apprehension about the use of the ordinance
 america or england main karypalika ke paas adhyadesh ke adhikaar nahin hai
 In India, ordinances have become a means of mocking the law-making process
 iske bare main sahi jaankaree ke abhaav main yah maamla aksar centre main congress banaam bijepi kii sarkaar kaa ban kar rah jaataa he
 Whereas the actual information of the ordinance in the states can make us better aware of this serious problem
 basharte hamaare ye dal bataa den ki ve adhyadesh kaa samarthan karte hai yaa nahin

 The sudden arrest of Hurriyat leaders took a new turn in the negotiation scenario and there was speculation about how Pakistan would react

 The cause of the pitiable condition of these two is no one else but their own son and daughter-in-law

 Now sons and daughters-in-law have occupied the house of an elderly couple forcibly

 According to the victim's father, he divided his three sons separately
 kisi ko dukaan to kisi ko makaan de diya tha or apane chote bete-bahu ke saath ghar main rah rahe the
 a few days ago, his elder son Ajay and his wife forcibly entered the house and removed the rest of their sons and daughters-in-law and children and now occupied the house

 Surprisingly, in the complaint application that he has given to the officers, he has also expressed the danger of life from his own son and daughter-in-law
