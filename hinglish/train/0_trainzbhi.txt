 The BJP hit out at the Congress over Navjot Singh Sidhu's statement at the inaugural function of the Kartarpur Corridor and the response published in the National Herald to the apex court's decision in the Ram temple case and demanded an apology from Congress President Sonia Gandhi

 Patra said that Sidhu is the tallest leader of the Congress and he made India small by his statement in Pakistan
 siddhu pakistani pradhanmantri kii tulana elexgender se karte hai, jo nindaneey he
 He said that Navjot Singh Sidhu's saying that 'we are killing and he (pakistan) is saving' shows the mood of the Congress

 ’gavaskar bhi is charchaa kaa hissaa the or jab unase poocha gaya ki kya test cricket se sanyas lene ke kaaran dhoni kaa khel prabhavit hua he, ‘unhone kaha, nahin katai nahin
 The truth is that he will now play with renewed vigor
 test cricket khilne kaa matlab he ki aapako lambey samay tak viketon ke peeche khadey rahanaa hoga or isse khel ke anya pahaluon par prabhaav padataa he
 It is good for him that he has retired from the long-term format

 Uproar in Parliament: Your questions, Ashok Singhal's answer
 Now the question arises that will not the Parliament be allowed to solve the problem like corruption? Or who will be responsible for the crores of rupees that the public spends in running the Parliament and which is currently being wasted? People also do not understand why the government is afraid to accept the opposition's demand
 aisa lagata he ki vipaksh ne kasam kha lee he ki jabatak uski maang puri nahin hogi wo sansad nahin chalane degaa
 But the Congress is adamant that it will not bow down to the BJP
 kuch logon ne yah sawaal kiya ki aakhir congress jepisi ke gathan se bachanaa kyon chaah rahi he
 Will the problem of scandal be solved only with the formation of JPC
 duusari ore kuch logon ne yah jigyaasa prakat kii ki bijepi jepisi kii hi maang par kyon adi he
 Who will be benefited by the formation of JPC on 2G spectrum scam? ashok singhl ne sabhi sawaalon ke sadhe hue jawaab die
 In such a situation, it seems that no one is in power or the opposition has any meaning to the people and both are putting emphasis in getting their point

 a lot of applications are available in the mobile market
 khaansee kii dawa se lekar body maas index bataane vaale health aplications or chehre kii banaavat ke aadhaar par chashme se lekar kapade tak sujhane vaale aplicoshan har kisi ke mobile par dikh jate hai
 Understand tomorrow's 'n Apple a day'
 
 'english Application Changed Today' n Applications Everyday
 
 It's done
 phir bhi dasiyon taraf se bisiyon aplications se ghire hone ke baavjood kuch khaas eps kii jarurat hamen ab bhi mahasoos hoti he
 Know about the ten apps that everyone needs on their mobile
 
 
 1
 App for Road Safety: This app should be developed to help all those people who are involved in net surfing or chatting while walking on the road
 saamne khambe,gadde yaa gaadi ke aate hi isamen alert bajnaa shuru ho janaa chahie
 2
 rishtedaaron ke liye ap:is ap ko bhartiya samskruti or sambandhon ke gyaan ke aadhaar par taiyaar karnaa chahie taaki ye swat: pataa laga sake ki koun mirzapur vaali buaa ke bete ke saale kaa sadhu aapaki profile kii ore badha aa rahaa he
 This app should have the feature to block all such distant relatives on their own
 3
 Useful app for students: This app should have features instead of course items, which can detect the presence of parents in the room and close all the social networking sites and immediately send them to a webpage related to heavy physics or chemistry
 mobile se zyada ye aplicoshan desktop par istemaal kiya jayega kyonki maa-baap kii aankh main padhai ke vakt dhul jhonkate samay bachche duusari teb par padhai se judaa content kholana bhul jate hai
 4
 phek profile pahchaanane vaala ap:ye ap kisi bhi nai profile se friend request aane par uske asli yaa nakli hone kii sambhaavna bataa saktaa ho
 5
 paan finder:ye aplicoshan path finder kii tarah kaam kar sake
 Although many apps such as Google Map are still running, this app will reveal the address of the nearest paan shop as only the 'native Google map-bhaiya bhaiya' can tell the exact information of the remaining routes in India
 6
 Auto Liker: This application will be for Facebook users
 ise inastol karte hi ye swat: news feed par aane vaali batakhmukhi selfies or 'eating galauti kebab' sareekhee mahatvapurn posts ko like kar degaa
 It should also have these paid features to comment on those updates like 'cute pic' itself
 saath hi do-chaar thenge or ankhe chamakaane vaali smiles bhi dhar de
 7
 or sunaao? ap :yah aplicoshan raat-raat bhar jagakar gutor-gun karne vaale nae-navele premi yugalon ke liye hoga
 In this, every three and a half minutes, say 'tell more?' There should be an asking system
 kyonki aadhi raat tak chalane vaale premalap main aadhe vakt to yahi baat kahi jaati he
 Every two hours during the rest of the day, 'woke up my babu?' , 'did you drink tea', 'have you eaten?' , 'abhi mummy hai here let's talk later Shona!' As if the function of sending the message itself
 8
 Password reminder: There is another password protected application to remind you of passwords of ten accounts, fifteen devices and a dozen atms
 9
 Mood Detector: This app can be used to detect the mood of wife and boss's anger, girlfriend shopping, family lectures and teachers in the class room giving them homework that is exciting and escapes
 basharte saamne vaale ne khud bhi ye ap install na kar rakhaa ho

 aise main to yahi lagata he ki bihar main agar nitish sarkaar ne vidhayak fund band karne kii pahal kii he to isamen hairaani kii baat nahin
 At the same time, Lalu's staunch opponent and JD (U) president Sharad Yadav is MP from Madhepura who is ahead of Lalu but not so much that he is called a pass
 sharad yadav 14 karod main mahaj 65 lakh hi kharch kar sake

 It is true that the Congress has opened up all its contact lines with the BJP and all the parties remaining from the Grand Alliance
 ek baat jisaki charchaa lagaataar ho rahi he ki kya samaajawaadee party se alag hokar nai party banane vaale shivpal yadav kaa nayaa dal pragatisheel samaajawaadee party congress ke gathbandhan kaa hissaa hoga? is par congress kii chuppi kaaphi kuch kah rahi he
 Actually, the Congress party is in touch with Shivpal Yadav, both Congress and Shivpal Yadav have confirmed this, but when both are ready then where is the screw in the alliance? Fear of displeasure with Akhilesh! The alliance will not go because if the Congress and Shivpal Yadav combine then the Samajwadi Party is left in the seat of Rae Bareli and Amethi
 Your candidate can take off and if he does not get the candidate, he will leave no stone unturned to defeat him
 congress kaa netritv bhalee-bhaanti jaanata he ki shivpal yadav ko saath lene kaa matlab he ki akhilesh yadav ko sidhe taur par chunauti dena or raajnneetik virodh ko rajnatik dushmani main tabdeel kar dena, yahi vajah he ki congress party shivpal yadav ke taraf se mil rahe sakaaratmak sanketon ke baad bhi khulkar unase gathbandhan kii baat nahin kar paa rahi
 Recently, during the visit of Priyanka Gandhi to Lucknow, the whispering picture of MLC Deepak Singh and Shivpal Yadav, considered close to Priyanka, came in the headlines, but even after a week, there was no talk about the alliance
 ab dekhnaa yah he ki amethi or raibareli ke dabaav main kya congress shivpal yadav ko akelaa chhodti he yaa phir front foot par khilne kaa daawa kar rahi congress shivpal yadav ke khatre uthaakar bhi saath rakhti he

 The debate on Sharia is not taking the name of freeze
 shuruyaat musalamaanon kaa netritv karne vaali sansthaaon se hoti he or bahes siyaasi napha-nuksaan tak pahunch jaati he
 Amidst the debate on triple talaq, halala, muta and missyar (contract marriage), the All India Muslim Personal Law Board's announcement to open 'darul Qaza' i
e
 Islamic Sharia Center in all districts of the country gave rise to a new debate on Sharia Have given
 desh kaa ek varg 'daarul kaja' ko samanaantar nyaayik vyavastha or sharai court qaraar dene kii koshish kar rahaa he to board ise samvidhan main pradutt nyaayik vyavastha kii sahaayak or madhyasth pranali bataa rahaa he
 Although 'darul Kaja' is already running in the country, but the issue of polarization is being made from this issue just before the general election
 ol india muslim personal lau board ke sadsy or varisht adhivaktaa jafarayab jilani ne 8 july ko, ''desh ke prayek jile main 'daarul kaja' kholane ke prastaav'' ke bare main kaha, iske baad saamaajik or rajnatik str par inke sanvaidhanik or vidhik auchity par bahes chhid gai
 However, during the debate on the Public Interest Litigation of Vishwalochan Madan, the Central Government had stated in the Supreme Court on May 12, 2009, "article 26 of the Indian Constitution guarantees religious freedom to all religions and communities, under which they can make Darul Establish, operate and manage their charitable institutions, including the Kaja or Sharia system
 ''aise main, is janhit yachika ko 7 july, 2014 ko supreme court ne yah kehete hue khaarij kar diya tha, ''ye samanaantar nyaayik vyavastha nahin hai
 They neither have any legal authority nor are their decisions legally binding
 '' court ne aise kendron ke sanchaalan par roak kii anumati se inkaar kar diya tha
 But this system was also given, "forcible enforcement of religion-based ideas or instructions will be illegal and a violation of fundamental rights
" ''asal main, jamiyat ulema-hind dwaara mahakama-e-sharia (sharia vibhaag), muslim personal lau board dwaara daarul kaja (kaaji centre) or imaarat-e-sharia dwaara sharai panchayat ke naam se inhen chalaaya ja rahaa he, jahaan musalamaanon ke shaadi, talaak or sampatti main hissedari ke maamalon main sharia ke tahat nibatare kii salaah di jaati he
 Since 1993, 50 such Darul Kaja have been operated all over the country under the Personal Law Board
 sawaal he ki jab supreme court in par roak lagane kii piiel khaarij kar chukaa he to chunaav se pehle inaki taadaad badhaane kii baat kitni jaij he?anjuman minhaj-e-rasul ke adhyaksh moulana saiyad atahar hossain dehalavi kehete hai, ''jaruri nahin ki har baat ko saarvajanik kiya hi jaae
 Muslim leadership should avoid rhetoric in the election year
 ''islamic vidwaan khalid anwar puranvi kehete hai, ''sharai adaalat or sharai court kaa shabd aate hi samanaantar vidhik vyavastha kii kalpana ubharne lagati he, lekin aisa nahin he
 "this is a new upset for the All India Muslim Personal Law Board at the Center regarding the debate over" Darul Kaja "
 teen talaak par supreme court main haarane ke baad halaala, muta or misyar jaisi prathaon ke maamalon par faisle aane baaki hai
 One of these petitioners was Drs
 samina begum to board ke astitv ke khilaaf hi supreme court main ladaai lard rahi hai
 She says, "we have demanded from the Supreme Court that Section 2 of the Muslim Personal Law (sharia) Application Act, 1937 be declared to be in violation of Articles 14A15A21 and 25 of the Constitution
 ''ol india muslim personal lau board ke sachiv or pravaktaa moulana khalid safullah rahamaani kehete hai, ''daarul kaja samanaantar court nahin hai, balki sulah karaane vaale court ke sahaayak hai jo desh main aazaadee ke baad se vibhinn shaharon main chal rahe hai
 The board wants to expand this system in areas where there is no Darul Kaja
 '' duusari ore uttar pradesh sarkaar ke adheen upi shiya central vakf board ke adhyaksh saiyad wasim rizvi ke anusaar, sharia adaalat chalaanaa deshadroh ke antargat aata he
 According to him, "sharia is not a rule in India
 aise main board dwaara kaaji (jaj) niyukt karnaa galat he
 The Government of India should immediately ban the All India Muslim Personal Law Board
 '' lekin moulana rahamaani isse sahamat nahin hai, ve rizvi ke bayaan ko yah kahkar khaarij karte hai, ''kuch log ek behatar kaam ko badnaam kar rahe hai
 "there is no roadmap for the board's plan to open Darul Kaza in every district of the country
 is par 15 july ko nai dilli main board ke sadasyon ke bich baithak main vimarsh hona he
 Following the announcement of the board, Union Minister of State for Law P
P
 pi
 Chaudhary reacted sharply, saying, "court is constituted only through the system made under the Constitution
 jaahir he, sharia court kaa koi kanoonee vajood nahin hoga
 "on the other hand, BJP MP Meenakshi Lekhi said," This is not the Islamic Republic of India
 sharia court ke liye kisi bhi jile, gaanv yaa shahar main koi jagah nahin he
 Saira Banu, the first petitioner to question the method of triple talaq, also considers the decision to open Darul Kaja in every district as meaningless for women
 ve bataati hai, ''court main jane se pehle maine bhi apane talaak ke masale kii charchaa ek mufti se kii thi
 But he justified the divorce through letters
 mufti ne saaf kah diya tha ki ab is masale main kuch bhi nahin kiya ja saktaa, talaak ho gaya he
 "the issue is clear that Darul Kaja is the only institution where Muslims can approach the Qazi with their issues
" faisla thik na lage to court jane ke liye aaazaad hai
 Kamal Farooqui, former chairman of the Delhi Minorities Commission and a social activist who fought for Muslim rights, says, "the questions raised about the legal status of Darul Kaja are meaningless, because no one said that this institution is an alternative to a court
" Or parallel body
 yah to bas choda gaya ek siyaasi shigupha bhar he
 "the way the dispute is being raised about the legal status of Darul Kaja and the Muslim Personal Law Board moves two steps forward on any issue and goes back two steps
" vaise main yahi lagata he ki sharia ke nae mudde uthaakar vah siyaasi napha-nuksaan kii jameen taiyaar kar rahaa he
 What is Darul Kaja? Any party, woman or man, gives his application in Darul Kaja
 kaaji donon pakshon ko notice jari karata he
 According to Islamic Sharia during the hearing, a written verdict is delivered
 haalanki faisle ko jabardastee lagu karwaane kii kaaji ke paas bharat main koi shakti nahin he
 Whether to believe it or not depends on both sides
 bharat main muslim personal lobharat main muslim personal lau aplication act 1937 main paas hua tha
 The British rulers intended to rule Indians under their cultural rules
 musalamaanon ke shaadi, talaak, viraasat or paariwarik vivaadon ke faisle is act ke tahat hi hote hai or inamen sarkaar dakhal nahin de sakati
 There are other religious laws, such laws have also been made for other religious groups in India

 Despite this, places like North Campus, South Campus and Metro are littered with posters

 '(input bhashaa se) Major disclosure has been made about Mehul Choksi, the main accused in the ongoing Punjab National Bank scam
 ajtak ko jaankaree mili he ki mehul chokasee america se antiguo island jaakar sharan lee he
 According to information received by sources from Aaj Tak, Mehul Choksi was in KV on July 8 last
 si bird interneshal airport pahunchaa he
 a day later, Indian agencies discussed the possibility of extraditing Mehul Choksi from the US
 jaankaree mili he ki mehul chokasee ne america se antigua jane ke liye jet blue flite kaa istemaal kiya
 Interestingly, Mehul has not used an Indian passport for this air journey
 mehul ke paas antigua kaa passportsutron se jaankaree mili he ki mehul chokasee ne antigua kaa passport hasil kar liya he
 According to the law of Antigua, if a person buys property worth 4 lakh US dollars, then he gets citizenship there
 iske alaava agar koi kaarobaari yahaan 1
 If he invests 5 million US dollars then he can also get citizenship of Antigua
 niyamon ke mutabik, ek or badi baat ye he ki passport hasil karne ke liye vahaan maujuud hona jaruri nahin hota he
 On the basis of which it can be said that during his absconding, Mehul Choksi took the passport of Antigua, after which he has now reached there
 mehul chokasee ke antigua pahunchane ke ek din baad bhartiya jaanch agenciyon ne america se uske pratyrpan kii baat kii thi
 But American agencies claimed that Mehul was not there
 bataa den ki kareeb 11 hajaar karod ke pienbi ghotaale main neerav modi or uske mamaa mehul chokasee mukhya aaropee hai
 Both Nirav Modi and Mehul are absconding
 neerav ke khilaaf interpol ne red corner notice jari kar diya he, jabaki mehul ke khilaaf notice jari karne kii prakriya chal rahi he
 Let me tell you that Mehul Choksi has recently written a letter saying that if he comes to India to cooperate in the investigation, he may be a victim of mob lynching

 bhartiya sainikon ne unhen lalakaara
 This was followed by firing and three militants were killed
 ghuspaith kii koshish naakaam kar di gai
 He said that three AK rifles have been recovered from the scene
 chaar maheene pehle ek tasviir ai thi
 The picture was of Badaun of UP
 tasviir main do bahanon kii laashen ped par lataki najar aa rahi thi
 Then the picture and the story behind the picture shook the entire country, but now four months later, the same case has suddenly taken a U-turn
 ek aisa you-turn jiske baad puri kahani hi palatati najar aa rahi he or ye you turn aayaa he is maamle ke iklaute chashmadid ke laai detector test ke baad
 After about three and a half months, now the same issue has started appearing on the head, i
e
, upside down
 duusare lafzon main kahen, to is maamle kii jaanch main ab ek aisa you turn aayaa he, jisane maamle kii tafteesh kar rahe sibiai ke dhakad afasaron kaa sir bhi ghuma diya he
 The only reason for this is that after the families of the two girls who were victims of the crime, the only witness in the case has also failed the cbi's lie-detection test
 darasal, baburam urf najaru hi wo shaks he, jisane katl se pehle donon bahanon ko aakiri baar dekha tha yaa phir yun kahen ki najaru ne hi police ko die gaye bayaan main 26 may kii shaam ko in bahanon ko aakhri dfa dekhne kii baat kahi thi
 Nazru even went on to say that both of these sisters were taking Pappu Yadav, a young man with them to the village, and when he tried to stop Pappu, he showed him the gun and drove away Nazru from there
 jaahir he, najaru ke is bayaan se maamle main shaq kii sui sidhe-sidhe pappu par hi jaakar tik gai or jab agle din subah donon bahanon kii laash ped se latakati hui mili, to sabake nishane par pappu hi tha
 Slowly the investigation progressed and a total of five people along with Pappu were arrested in the case
 lekin jab maamle kii jaanch sibiai ke hawaale hui or usne tafteesh ko aage badhaane se pehle isaki tasdik kaa faisla kiya, to use pehla jhatka tab laga, jab ladakiyon ke gharavaale hi laai ditection test main fail ho gaye
 That is, earlier, while testifying Najru's statement, the people who were accused by the family members of killing their daughters, could not completely keep up with those things during the test
 aise main ab sibiai ke saamne baburam urf najaru ke laai ditection ke sivaay koi chaara nahin tha
 So, before deciding to pursue the case, he also decided to grope the witness whose statement was based on the entire case, but the cbi's surprise was no longer open when a report from the forensic lab cleared that the girls Like the family members of Najru, he was involved in a game of lies and truth
 laai ditection test main wo apane die gaye bayaan se naa sirf dig gaya, balki ye bhi bataa gaya ki uske paas ek mobile phone bhi he, jabaki isse pehle najaru ne apane paas mobile phone hone kii baat se inkaar kiya tha
 Apparently, there was something that Nazru was trying to hide
 aise main ab sibiai ne naa sirf uske laai ditection test ke baad maamle ke tathyon ko nae sire se khangaalane kaa faisalaa kiya he, balki uske mobile phone ko baraamad kar use forensik investigeshan ke liye bhijwa diya he
 The first turning point in this case came on the same day, when the CBI questioned the girls' families after taking over the investigation of the case
 sutron kii maane to unheen dinon sibiai ko peedit parivaar ke bayanon main kai aise virodhabhas najar aae, jisase is maamle ko lekar shaq paidaa ho gaya, lekin tab ye baat or pukhta ho gai, jab postmortem ke baad is maamle kii duusari forensik report ai
 In fact, the CBI had earlier decided to get the bodies of both the sisters carved from the tomb and get their post-mortem done again, but when the tomb of the two sisters was buried in the Ganges, the CBI decided to get the forensic exhibits collected earlier

 Later, the hair, bracelets and shoes recovered from the skeleton led to the belief that the dead were Hindustani
 lihaaza ab un sabhi laashon ke diene ko us diene se milaayaa gaya jo videsh rajya mantri iraq lekar gaye the
 The DNA of 38 corpses matched the missing Indians
 yani ye sabit ho gaya ki june 2014 se laapata un bharatiyon ko bagdadi ke aatankwaadiyon ne tabhi maar daalaa tha
 The Government of India also knew this thing for the last three years
 magar wo unki maut kaa elaan karne se batch rahi thi
 Because the government had no proof
 ab saboot mila to maut par muhar laga di gai or isi ke saath un pariwaron kii ummiden bhi dafn ho gai, jo apano ke jinda hone kii aas lagaae baithe the
 Now all those houses have weeds
 shakti ke 3 aise dham hai jinke dar par jaakar bhakton ko milti he aseem shanti or unke tamaam dukh, takalifon kaa ho jaataa he naash
 The mother takes away all the grief of the devotees at Tara's abode in Mother Bir of West Bengal
 10 mahavidhyaon main se ek maa tara ke dar se kabhi koi khaali haath nahin lautataa
 The court of the mother resonates with the sacred sound of the conch, the crowds of devotees with fierce devotion to the Darshan Darshan, the devotees chanting the songs of the mother, devotion in the mind and wishing to gaze at the mother for a moment in the eye
 maa tara ke mandir main bhakthi kaa ye alokik nazaaraa dikhataa he
 That which binds the devotees, immerses them in the juice of devotion
 maa ke chamatkaar kii kai kahaniyaan yahaan sunne ko mil jaati hai to mandir ke nirmaan ke bare main kai tarah kii kathaayen prachlit hai
 It is believed that when Lord Shiva had poisoned at the time of Samudra Manthan, his gorge turned blue due to the effect of poison and he was breastfed by mother Tara to reduce the effect of the poison
 is mandir main maujuud maa tara kii pratimaa main maa kii god main bhagwaan shiv aaj bhi virajman hai
 After the construction of the temple, the temple was completely destroyed twice due to natural reasons, but no damage to the idol of the mother was done, after which his devotees renovated the temple again
 maa tara kii puja-archana ke liye mandir main subah ke teen baje se hi mata kaa darbar sajnaa shuru ho jaataa he
 In the morning, firstly, the mother is given a bath in which oil of rose water, gangajal, honey, ghee and java safflower is used
 mana jaataa he ki maa ko snaan karana puja kaa abhinn ang he jisamen madiraa kaa prayog anivaary hota he
 After bathing, it is the turn of the mother's makeup
 maa ko rajbhusha, mukut, kesh, sindur or bindi lagaakar bhavy rup main taiyaar kiya jaataa he
 Among all these rituals of worship, the most unique thing is that after the aarti of the mother, the mother is first offered mishri water
 yun to salbhar maa ko kheer, dahi, mithai khichdi, sabji or paanch tarah ke pakwaan kaa bhoga lagaaya jaataa he lekin maa ke bhoga main mithai kaa hona behad jaruri he
 It is said that by offering sweets to the mother, the mother is pleased and gives a boon to the devotees
 sandhya aarti se pehle shaam main maa kaa phulon se shringaar hota he or raat main sheethal bhoga lagane ke baad hi mandir ke pat band kar diye jate hai
 Generally, the devotees offer prayers to the mother during the day, but tantra practitioners are seen doing mother's work at night
 kehete hai gupt vidya kii prapti ke liye yahaan sadhana karne waalon ko maa kaa aashirwad jarur miltaa he
 Near the temple, near the cremation ghat on the banks of the river, many seekers do penance for hours and get siddhis from their mother
 birbhum main hi virajati maa nalateshwari devi
 It is said that when Lord Shiva was doing Tandava with the body of Sati, Lord Vishnu cut Sati's body into pieces with his chakra
 birbhum main isi sthaan par maa ke gale kii nalee giri thi jiske kaaran maa ke is dham kaa naam nalateshwari padaa
 The temple bathed in light tells the story of the glory of a sati, the victory of faith and the breaking of the pride of a king
 ye kahani he pashchim bengal ke birbhum jile ke nalateshwari devi mandir kii
 Nalateshwari Devi
 
 
 desh kii 51 shaktipeethon main ek
 
 
 The ultimate abode of Shakti where fell Sati's neck pipe, due to which the name of this sacred court was named Nalateshwari Devi Temple
 darasal jab pita ke apmaan se tilamilaai mata parvati sati ho gayi to bhagwaan shiv ne unke sharir ke saath tandav karnaa shuru kar diya
 Fearing destruction in the universe, Vishnu resorted to his Sudarshan Chakra and cut Parvati's body into several pieces
 wo tukade jahaan-jahaan gire, wo shakti-peeth kehalaae
 Nalateshwari Devi Temple is one of the same Shaktipeeths
 kehete hai ki mata sati kii yahaan gale kii nalee giri thi
 Years later, Mata appeared to a devotee in a dream after which this magnificent temple was constructed
 mata kii pratimaa ke neeche maujuud nalee usee ghatana ko darshaati he jisamen aaj bhi 24 ghante jal bharaa rahata he
 The water level remains the same even today in this tube surrounded by stones
 manyata he ki nalateshwari devi kii agar vidhi vidhaan se puja kar lee jaae, to maa use turant fal bhi de detii hai or agar aapke daapantya sambandhon main koi daraara aa gayi he phir aap apane rishton main mithaas laana chaahate hai to maa ke darbar main sheesh nawane bhar se rishton main madhurata aati he
 To get the blessings of the mother, after bathing in the morning, a beautiful vermilion of the Goddess is done and after that the morning Mangala Aarti begins
 maa ko bhoga main machhlee, chaaval chadhaaya jaataa he
 Usually, the mother is worshiped here like this every day, but the sight of this temple on Durga Puja and Kali Puja is made
 maa ke is darbar main mahaprasad kaa aayojan kiya jaataa he
 Apart from this, Shashthi day of Jyeshtha month is also special on this day
 bagal main is din ko jamaai shashthee kaha jaataa he or is din lakhon kii sankhya main shraddhalu yahaan aakar maa kaa aashirwad lete hai 
 Now read about the glory of mother Ashtabhuja who is sitting on Vindhya mountain of Mirzapur
 maa ashtabhuja, bhay ko dur kar safalataa kaa aashirwad dene vaali, vidya, buddhi kaa vardaan dene vaali, mushkilon ko harne vaali maa
 The specialty of this Siddhapeeth is that no one ever goes empty-handed from here, no call is ever unheard of here, be it a king or a rake, the mother showering equal grace on everyone here
 maa ashtabhuja kaa ye paavan dham basaa he mirzapur main vindhya parvat par nivas karne vaali maa vindhyavaasani ke pashchimi chor par
 Hearing the name of the mother Ashtabhuja for the first time, it seems that the mother gives the form of eight arms to the devotees, but the story of the name of the mother is not related to her form but her setting on this mountain
 kehete hai dwapar yug main kansa ke badhate atyaachaar se prithvi ko mukt karaane ke liye garg rishi vindhya parvat par maa ko prasann karne ke liye kathor tapasya kii jiske baad maa ne nand baba ke ghar kanya rup main janm liya
 But Vasudeva left Gokul to Lord Krishna and took the girl with him to prison
 kansa ko jab devaki kii aathvin santan ke hone kii khabar mili to kansa ne us kanya ko maanane ke liye jaise hi pathar par phenkane kii koshish ki kanya hawa main ud gai or usne ashtabhuja devi kaa rup dhaaran kar liya
 Vindhya mountain as mother Ashtabhuja is blessed by the devotees of the mother Yogmaya, who worship the devotees in the name of mother Ashtabhuja and give proof of fingerprints on the feet of the mother
 kehete hai ye kansa ke ungaliyon ke nishaan hai
 Mother Ashtabhuja is believed to fulfill all wishes, but especially devotees worship the mother as the goddess of knowledge
 jinhen maa ke aam mandiron kii tarah nariyal or pushp ke chadhaave se kiya jaataa he prasann
 It is believed that once the mother's blessing is received, even the biggest crisis is overcome and success starts in the work
 maa ashtabhuja kaa ye bhavy rup bhakton ko unki taraf khinchataa he
 It is the reverence and belief of the Goddess that in the Navratri, the devotees do visit the mother Ashtabhuja after seeing the mother Vindhyavasini
 or khud ko dhanya maanate hai

 aajkal bacchon main baahar khilne kii jagah ghanton ek jagah baithkar tivi dekhne kii aadat bad rahi he
 While watching TV is not a bad thing, but everything is very bad
 jiske bhavishya main behad nuksaan uthaane pad sakate hai
 In a recent study, it was reported that watching TV at a young age affects the mental and physical development of children
 pediatric research jarnal main prakashit study ke mutabik bachapan main zyada tivi dekhne se bacchon ke shaareerik, maansik, saamaajik or aarthik vikaas par asar pad saktaa he
 Apart from this, this study also emphasized that due to the habit of watching TV, there is also increasing attraction towards junk food among children
 bataa den, is study ke madhyam se yah jaanane kii koshish kii gai ki agar bacchon ko choti umr main hi unka ek personal tivi de diya jaae to isse unke shaareerik, maansik or saamaajik vikaas par kya asar padegaa
 In this study, researchers took data of about 1859 children who were born between 1997 and 1998
 iske awala unhone 13 saal tak ke bacchon kii sehat kaa bhi ek adhyan kiya
 Some important aspects have been emphasized while studying these children
 udhaaharan ke liye bacchon kaa body maas check kiya gaya, unki khaane kii aadaton par gaur kiya gaya or unki teacher se unke vyavhaar ke bare main jaankaree bhi lee gai
 Please tell, the consistency of children also has a great impact on their personality, so that aspect was also made part of the study
 is vyapak study ke parinaam bilkul bhi santoshjanak nahin dikhe
 According to the study, the homes in which people had installed a personal TV for them in the bedroom of their young children, were having a wrong effect on the development of those children
 un bacchon main bhavishya main hai biemai, junk food kii taraf rujhaan, depressant aadi kii samasya dekhi gai
 According to the study's lead researcher, Linda Pagani, where you keep TV at your home, it also has a profound effect on the lives of your children
 unhone is baat par jor diya ki tivi kabhi bhi personal bedroom main naa ho or ek tay avadhi tak hi bacchon ko dekhne diya jaae

 Opposition to demonetisation, the opposition is creating uproar from Parliament to the street
 alag-alag vipakshi partiyaan notebandi kii vajah se ho rahi pareshaaniyon ko mudda banane main juty hai
 Now that the public does not get angry with the ban on demonetisation, the BJP may have made up its mind to hit the road thinking this
 shuruyaat dilli se ho rahi he, shuukravaar ko dilli membijapike hajaaron kaaryakartaaon ko sadak par utaarne kii taiyaari he, jisamen notebandi ke samarthan main maahaul banane kaa makasad hoga
 The BJP has named it the Sankalp March, in which BJP leaders and workers will garner support for demonetisation on the road with the slogan 'I support Modi'
 is raily ke jariye bijepi kaa makasad logon ko samajhane kaa hoga ki puraane noton ko band karke piem modi ne kaale dhan ke khilaaf ladaai shuru kii he, jisase na sirf desh kii arthvyavastha sudharegi, balki aane vaale vakt main aam aadmi tak bhi iskaa phayda pahonchega
 At the same time, the bjp's objective is that the opposition is opposing demonetisation, it is not for the benefit of the common people, but political parties have their own interests
 dilli bijepi ke adhyakshasatish upaadhyaayke mutabik sankalp march kaa mukhya makasad vipaksh dwaara failaai ja rahi afvaahon se logon ko saavdhaan karne kaa he
 Misleading information is being given to the people, so that people protest against demonetisation, but now the BJP workers will go out on the road and reach out to the people and speak to them and explain the benefits of demonetisation to them
 bijepi ne iske liye puraa ek campan bhi banaaya he, jisamen hording poster ke saath sankalp yatra ke liye takhtiyaan banaayi gayi he
 The benefits of demonetisation will be counted to people through different slogans
 bijepi logon ko notebandi ke baad hone vaale jin phaaydon ko ginane kii baat kar rahi he, unamem shaamil hai-aatankwaad kaa hoga khatmaaek-ek phaayde ko bade loklubhaavan andaaz main ginaya gaya he
 The first advantage in this is the militant and extremist action of the Naxalites
 poster main daawa kiya gaya he ki notebandi se aatankwaad kaa khaatmaa karne main madad milegi, kyonki kaledhan ke jariye hi desh main aatankwaad fal phool rahaa he
 Buying a house will be easy The second biggest benefit has been counted as the abolition of black money, because the money earned by corruption in this demonetization has become useless
 tisare phaayde ke taur par daawa kiya gaya he ki notebandi se real estate sector main bhav kam honge or makaan khareednaa ab aam aadmi kii jad main aa jayega
 The fake currency will end, the fourth benefit will be the elimination of fake currency, which is present in large scale in the country
 kyonki paanch sau or hajaar rupye ke nakli note pakistan se chhapakar aate hai or desh kii arthvyavastha ko kam kar rahe the
 But demonetisation will now end fake currency
 shuukravaar ko valmiki mandir se bijepi kii sankalp yatra shuru hogi, jo sansad maarg par patel chowk tak jaaegi
 For this, the party has prepared extensively to gain support for demonetisation among the common people before the opposition's Bharat Bandh i
e
 before 28 November
 bijepi is baat ko lekar bhi phikrmand he kyonki dilli main aam aadmi party pehle hi sadak par utarkar andolan kar chuki he or lagaataar notebandi ke virodh main pradarshan kar rahi he

 sarkari funds is tarah ke prapojal ko nahin diya jaataa he lekin didisie ne khud ke liye fund ikatta karne ke liye kai tarah kii ranneeti banaai kyonki firozshah kotla kaa naam badla hi nahi gaya isliye ye minutes of meeting kaa hissaa bhi nahi he
 Jethmalani: You developed the Firoz Shah Stadium with a self fund because you did not want government intervention in it
 jetali:ye puri tarah galat he
 Government funds are often not given to private associations in the country
 firozshah stadium ke nirmaan kaam ke liye bhi ek privet company ko biding ke jariye ye contract diya gaya
 Jethmalani: Political people wasted 57 crores rupees in Ferozeshah Kotla
 is par aapkaa kya kahana he?jetali:ye aarope galat he
 My knowledge and opinion is that the kind of allegations that were leveled against me were completely wrong
 media se jo jaankaree mujhe mili uske aadhaar par main kah saktaa hum ki firozshah ke stadium par jo kharch aayaa wo stadium ke modenaijeshan ke liye jaruri tha
 Therefore, the allegation of misuse of Rs 57 crore is grossly wrong
 jo bhi kharch hua uske satyaapan ke liye firozshah stadium me hue kaam ko dekha ja saktaa he
 On May 17, the High Court will hear again in this case
