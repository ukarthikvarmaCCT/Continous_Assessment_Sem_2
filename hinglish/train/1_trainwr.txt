 To kill him at any cost

 One of them shot him
 haalanki jab ye sab kuch ho rahaa tha to vahaan or bhi log maujuud the
 But everyone kept their eyes closed
 aisa laga koi kuch dekh hi nahin rahaa tha
 But there was an eyewitness who did not have her eyes closed
 wo sabakuch dekh rahaa tha
 But he too was just watching
 kyonki wo kuch kar nahin saktaa tha
 But even just watching it proved to be effective for the law
 petrol pump maalik kii goli markar hatyamrane se pehle usne bachane kii koshish bahut kii
 But when the whole of about half a dozen people fall behind the life of a human being, how can luck also save him
 kahani petrol pump ke had main bane kamare main shuru hui or isi main khatm bhi ho gai
 There were a few employees at the petrol pump during the night
 magar chah-chah camere petrol pump ke har chappe ko ricard kar rahe the
 In this office of Surya Shivam Petrol Pump in Hardia area of begusarai, the Munshi Umesh of the pump was busy in the book for a day
 kyonki kuch hi der main pump ke maalik lakshmi narayan singh urf chotu ji aane vaale the
 But Umesh's uneasiness was very much visible on this day
 pichley 18 saalon main umesh aisa kabhi nahin dikhaa tha
 As it was seen today
 wo kabhi baahar ja rahaa tha
 Was coming in once munshi kii bhoomika sandigdhtabhi lakshmi narayan singh kamare main daakhil hote hai or din bhar ke hisaab kitaab ko jaanchane lag jate hai
 Umesh stands there
 phone aata he or lakshmi narayan singh baat karne main mashgool ho jate hai
 Shortly after Umesh walks out of the room and just five minutes after he leaves the room, a person enters the room
 sir par kapadaa baandhe ye koi aisa shaks tha jise maalik lakshmi narayan singh bilkul nahin jaanate the
 As soon as he enters the room, this man lashes a pistol at Laxmi Narayan Singh's temple
 magar darane ke bajaae lakshmi narayan singh puri shiddat se us shaks kaa saamana karte hai
 Once upon a time, they push him out of the room without scaring him
 badmaash ne seene main maari golilihaaza maamla bigadate dekh ye shaks unke seene main goli maar detaa he
 Lakshmi Narayan Singh's T-shirt turns red with blood, but he does not give up and enters the room and faces the hawlwar who is withdrawing money from the counter
 yahaan tak ki wo use zamin par patake dete hai
 But in this tussle, he had lost a lot of blood and in this condition, he falls face down on the ground
 mahaz 30 second main lakshmi narayan singh zamin par ediyaan ragad rahe the or hatyara khun kar ke faraar ho chukaa tha
 The owner of the petrol pump succumbed painfully
 magar unke pump kaa koi karmchaaree unhen bachaane nahin aayaa balki ek karmchaaree kamare kii choukhat par aakar usee haalat main lakshmi narayan singh kii photo khinchakar chalaa jaataa he
 Employees were pulling instead of help
 Instead of being surprised that the crooks went out of their way by killing the owner in a petrol pump without any fear
 karmchaariyon ulta maalik kii laash kii photo khinchne main lage hue the
 But these were just pictures of a camera that recorded this sensational incident
 pump par lage baaki camere bhi hatyaron or unke saathiyon kii harkaton ko record kar rahe the
 Different cameras in the pump were recording the movements of the outside at the time of killing from their respective angles
 katl se pehle pump main bane offis se nikalakar munshi umesh bathroom jaataa he magar na to wo bathroom kii lite jalaata he or na hi uske darvaaze ko band karata he
 That's when the two criminals arrive at the pump riding a motorcycle
 thik 30 second baad shooter bhi isi camere main dikhaai detaa he
 Ishravo looks at these miscreants as the miscreant and the miscreants behind the motorcycle point at him with his hands raised
 jis vaqt hatyara offis ke andar lakshmi narayan singh kaa katl kar rahaa tha, thik usee vaqt unka karmchaaree ajibo-garib tareeke vahaan lage ek binar ko bevajaah thik karte hue nazar aayaa
 It is the police who took the picture of Lakshmi Narayan Singh after the murder
 is puri vaardaat main pump ke karmchaariyon kii harakatein shako-shubha karne vaali thi
 The owner of the petrol pump gets killed but instead of catching the accused or saving the owner, he was seen taking photographs
 bekhauf badmaash sadak kinare petrol pump ke maalik ko markar chale jate hai or uske apane hi karmchaaree use bachaane ke bajaae uske marane ke baad mobile main uski tasviren lete hue sisitivi camere main record hote hai
 Was this a well-planned conspiracy? There is something in this case that has a curtain on it
 varanaa ye kaise mumkin he ki gunde itani badi vaardaat ko itani aasaani se anjaam de kar nikal jaaen or koi unhen rokane bich main hi naa aae
 The way Surya Shivam Petrol Pump was killed in Hardia area of begusarai, the owner of the pump, Laxmi Narayan Singh, is raising many questions
 lakshmi narayan singh urf chotu bhaiyya ke gharavaalon kaa shaq he ki hatya kii ye vaardaat ek sochi samajhi saazish he
 Because the way the assassins entered the pump fearlessly and the way the employees of the pump present on the spot are recorded in the camera, they bring them into the realm of power
 camere main ricard us raat kii vaardaat main hatya ke vaqt do bike par savaar hokar paanch lutere aae the
 Seven people arrested: In this case, police has arrested seven people
 lekin bataaya ja rahaa he ki mukhya aaropee abhi bhi faraar he
 Householders are refusing to consider it a case of loot
 haalanki police ne is maamle menaropiyon ko giraftarakarne ke alaava vaardaat main istemaal kiye gaye hathiyaar or motor cycle baraamad kar lee he
 Police is also interrogating the arrested accused
 haalanki police kii daleel par gharavaalon ko yakeen nahin
 The family suspects that the police want to end the case by arresting only those people except the main accused
 jo camere main dikhaai de rahe the
 The accused Raja, who has been caught by the police, has been involved in many such incidents in the past
 sirf begusarai jile main aisi kai vaaradaaten petrol pump par ho chuki hai
 The entire incident of CCTV imprisonment may be looking at the case from the angle of robbery, but according to the pictures recorded in CCTV, the murder victims did not appear to be interested in raising money
 police ne aropiyon ke alaava pump ke karmchaaree bamabam or umesh ko hiraasat main liya tha
 But they left him after questioning
 sisitivi main kaid tasveeron main unki bhoomika kaaphi sandigdh nazar aa rahi he
 Laxmi Narayan, the petrol pump owner who was shot by miscreants, was the third of his brothers who has died
 isse pehle unke do bhai accident main maare gaye, jinamein se ek kii train se girakar maut hui
 In Begusarai, continuous criminals are committing acts without fear
 lut or hatya jaisi vaaradaaten ab yahaan aam hone lagi hai
 If you have just started your relationship, then a slight smile will always be on your face, but there will also be some concerns that will always surround you
 jaise ki aapako is baat kaa dar rahegaa ki aapkaa rishta sahi se chalegaa yaa nahin
 If you also want to know whether your life partner is right for you, then we are giving some ways to test them: 1
 uske khilaaf jaakar kuch karen:kuch mard aise hote hai jo apni garlfrand cocontrolmen rakhana chaahate hai
 In such a situation, if you do something against their wishes, they get very angry
 ho saktaa he aap apni puri jindagi aise gussell aadmi ke saath nahin bitaana chahengi
 But if they get angry after a little anger that there is nothing for them more than your happiness, then that boy is perfect for you
 ye 5 sicrates sirf best friend ko hi pataa hote hai
 
 
 2
 bahes kar ke dekhen:kisi din kisi bhi baat ko lekar bahes karnaa shuru kar den
 Then see how he is reacting to it
 agar wo apana vichaar shanti se samajha rahaa he to insaan aapke liye sahi he lekin yadi wo aapaki soch ko badalanaa chahta he to aise aadmi ke saath jindagi bitaane se pehle ek baar soch jarur len
 Whether it is single or Mingle Garba, such colors will fill your life
 
 
 3
 Test her patience: It is very important for one partner to be patient in a relationship
 yadi donon ko gussa jaldi aata he to yah rishte ke liye thik nahin he
 How soon does he get angry for his examination or how soon does he become normal after getting angry
 4
 Turn off your mobile for one day: Turn off your mobile for one day
 duusare din on kar ke dekhen ki usne kol yaa messej kiya he yaa nahin
 If he has not made a single message or call, he does not care for you at all
 yadi uke bahut se messetus yaa colls he to aap par shaq karata he or rishte main bilkul bhi spes nahin detaa
 If there are calls and messages in the limit, then you understand that this is the right partner for you
 5
 Tell them that you have spent the night at a friend's house: if they change their facial expressions as soon as they say this then they do not believe in you
 6
 Praise the other man in front of him: If he gets angry as soon as he praises the other man in front of him, then he needs to know all the things about the girls because praising someone does not mean that you like him

 aisa kar ke aap apane partner kii maansikta ko samaj paaengi

 'manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi (manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi)' has spent about 52 crores in the last five days at the box office (manikarnika Box Office collection)
 kii kamai kar lee he, or film kii heroin kangana ranut (kangana Ranaut) apni kamyaabi kaa jashn switsraland ke alps main ski karke manaa rahi hai
 a video of Kangana Ranaut is going viral in which he is skiing in Switzerland in a very spectacular style, and you will also be surprised to see this style of Kangana Ranaut
 kangana ranut bahut hi masti ke saath ski kar rahi hai
 Anyway, Kangana Ranaut is from Chamba in Himachal Pradesh, and she will love the snow
 a post shared by Kangana Ranaut (@team_kangana_ranaut) on Jan 30, 2019 at 6:44am psttima kangana ranut (kangana Ranaut) ne is video ko apane instagram pej par post kiya he or likhaa he ki 'manikarnikah da queen of jhaansi (manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi)' kii safalataa ke baad kangana ranut
 In fact, Kangana Ranaut has played the character of Rani of Jhansi in Manikarnika very resolutely
 kangana ranut kii is kirdaar ke liye khub tarif bhi ho rahi he
 After so much effort, a little rest is made
 a post shared by Kangana Ranaut (@team_kangana_ranaut) on Jan 20, 2019 at 8:26pm pstkamgana ranut (kangana Ranaut) kii 'manikarnikah da queen of jhaansi (manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi)' 25 janvari ko relies hui he
 The budget of 'manikarnika' is around 100-125 crores
 bataaya jaataa he
 But the film made 52 crores in the first five days itself
 kaa bijness kar liya he or bataaya jaataa he ki film ke satellite ritis bhi 30 karod ru
 Are sold in is hafte box offis par koi bahut badi film nahin aa rahi he, sirf sonam kapur or anil kapur kii 'ek ladki ko dekha to aisa laga' relies ho rahi he
 In such a situation, the path of Rani of Jhansi can be stronger
 karnataka main janata dal (es) or congress gathbandhan kii sarkaar banane se thik 24 ghante pehle bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah ne puure vishwaas ke saath kaha ki 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main rashtriya janatantric gathbandhan (bhaajapa kii aguwai vaali endie) ekatarfa jeet hasil karegi
 They base this belief on the performance of the Narendra Modi government and the popularity of the Prime Minister himself
 lekin yah sikke kaa ek pahalu he
 The second and perhaps more important aspect that Shah has in mind is Modi's art of turning anti-incumbency trends decisively in favor of the BJP, which he has been repeatedly referring to with BJP leaders
 2009 se lekar 2013 june tak (lagbhag chaar saal) mukhya vipakshi dal ke rup main bhaajapa tejahin najar aati thi
 In June, at the National Executive of Goa, Narendra Modi was made the head of the Election Campaign Committee for the 2014 Lok Sabha elections and later the prime ministerial candidate
 unhone 10 saal se centre kii satta main kabiz manmohan singh sarkaar ke khilaaf ekatra satta virdohi rujhaan ko bhaajapa ke paksh main is kadar modaa kii pehali baar bhaajapa loksabhaa main apane dam par purna bahumat hasil karne main kaamyaab rahi
 From here, Modi succeeded in capitalizing on the anti-incumbency against the Congress and other parties in various states
 haryana, maharashtra se shuru hue safar kaa philhal aakhri mukaam karnataka rahaa
 In most of the states where elections were held in the last four years, Modi succeeded
 jahaan kamyaabi nahin mili vahaan bhaajapa ko vot share badhaane main modi jarur kaamyaab hue
 For example, West Bengal, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Bihar etc
 modi kii yahi takat amit shah ko vah ummid detii he jiske boote ve yah daawa khuleam karte hai ki 2019 main bhaajapa ekataraf jeet hasil karegi
 Shah is assessing that the BJP will perform well in the Coromandel state (odisha-bengal-andhra Pradesh) from the Lok Sabha elections point of view
 chunki odisha, pashchim bengal, telugana or andhra pradesh main gaiyr-bhaajapa sarkaar he lihaaja bhaajapa or shah maan rahe hai ki in ilaakon main satta-virdohi rujhaan ko modi bhaajapa ke paksh main karne main safal rahenge
 Shah has said on several occasions before that in 2014, the states where the BJP had a great success may lose some seats
 lekin saath hi ve yah bhi jodate hai ki isaki bharpai un rajyon se hogi jahaan bhaajapa 2014 main seat nahin jeet saki thi yaa ikkaa-dukka seat hi jeet saki thi
 He has already started the initiative to increase the party's work in 150 such seats of Tatiya states three years ago
 coromandal rajya main loksabhaa kii kul 105 siten hai (telugana ko mila kar)
 Shah hopes that these states BJP will do wonders
 bhaajapa saansad anil baluni kehete hai ki bengal or odisha main bhaajapa ne kaaphi mehnat kii he or in donon rajyon main pramukh vipakshi dal kii bhoomika main logon ke saamne ubhari he
 The party hopes to do well in these states in 2019
 bhaajapa adhyaksh or party ke is yakeen ke bich karnataka main jis tarah se modi ke khilaaf vipaksh lamaband hua he usase bhaajapa kii raah utani aasaan bhi nahin he
 Especially when the truth is that Modi is hardly able to make pro-incumbency trends in the states ruled by his party
 masalan, gujarat or goa
 In Gujarat, the BJP government was formed with difficulty and in Goa, the BJP had become the second party
 2019 main jab loksabhaa ke chunaav honge to zyaadaatar rajyon main bhaajapa kii sarkaar hogi or modi ke saamne in rajya sarkaron ke khilaaf bolne kaa mauka nahin hoga
 *** soshal network diggaj fasebuk ne ek bada elaan kiya he
 Under this, White Nationalism and Separatism will now be banned from Facebook
 ye faisla fasebuk ne newjiland ke christchurch aatanki hamale ke baad liya he jahaan ek shooter ne masjid main ghus kar 50 logon kii hatya kar di thi
 Facebook said in a blog post, 'under the new policy, the praise, support and representation of White Nationalism and Separatism from Facebook and Instagram is being banished and will come into force from next week'
 fasebuk ne kaha he ki yah saaf he ki is tarah ke concept puri tarah se organijd het grups ke saath linkd hote hai or hamaari sarvice main inke liye koi jagah nahin he
 It is worth noting that Facebook had already banned White Supermacist content some time ago
 haalanki wggit nesanalism ko bain karnaa bada kadam bataaya ja rahaa he
 However, Facebook has not mentioned the Christchurch terror attack in New Zealand in this blog post
 fasebuk ke mutabik pichley teen maheenon main company ne civil socity ke logon se baatcheet kii he jo is maamle ke export hai or unhone ye conform kiya he ki White Nationalism or Separatism ko het White Supermacy ke het group se alag nahin rakh sakate hai
 Facebook has reviewed such organization before banning such content and termed it dangerous
 fasebuk ne kaha he ki log abhi bhi apane dharm ko lekar garv kaa pradarshan kar sakate hai, lekin shwet rashtrawaad or shwet algaavvaad ke liye prashansa yaa samarthan bardaasht nahin kiya jayega
 Facebook has said that banning such content is not the end, but that the company will connect with people who are associated with such nationalism and separatism
 fasebuk ne kaha he, ‘afosus he ki kuch log hameshaa hi hamaare system ko torget karne kii koshish karte hai taaki nafrat failaai ja sake
 Our challenge is to stay ahead of it and continuously improve our technology, improve the policy and work with the experts

 Ramdev had said on Friday that Rahul Gandhi goes on a honeymoon in a Dalit colony
 police ne shanivaar ko ramdev ke is bayaan par khud sangyaan lete hue unke khilaaf cese darj kiya
 Meanwhile, after the FIR was registered, Ramdev said that if anyone is hurt by his statement, then he expresses regret
 ramdev ne ek tasviir dikhaate hue kaha ki main dalit mahilaon ke charan chhukar sammelan karata hum
 My purpose was not to insult anyone
 isse pehle congress kii ore se krishna tirath, kumari shailaja or shobhaa ojha ne press conference kar ramdev ke khilaaf hamalaa bolaa
 Kumari Selja said that Ramdev's statement was condemnable
 isse dalit mahilaon ke prati unka najariya pataa chalata he
 Our leader's image is tarnished
 unhone sawaal uthaate hue kaha ki kya dalit mahilaayein upbhog kii hi vastu hai jiske bare main ramdev ne tippanee kii ha? modi or bijepi spasht karen ki wo ramdev ke saath he yaa nahin
 The time has come for Modi to clarify his opinion on whether he supports Ramdev's statement or not
 modi or ramdev ko daliton se maafee maangani chahie
 Tirath said that this is Ramdev's anti-dalit mentality
 unhone kahaaki ramdev bijepi or modi ke pravaktaa hai
 Tirath said that the Dalits demand rights, not begging
 unhone kaha ki garibon or daliton kii dasha dekhne or jaanane kii koshish karnaa honeymoon nahin he
 Shobha Ojha said that Ramdev is one of Modi's Chandal quartet
 exiaar darj kar ramdev ko essi act main giraftaar kiya jaae
 He said that Modi is not calling himself and calling someone else
 dalit mahilaayein jawaab chaahati hai ki mahilaon kaa sammaan aise hi hoga
 Jashoda Ben, Ramdev's statement and the snooping case are examples of this
 congress ke hamalon kaa jawaab dene ke liye bijepi ne press conference kar ramdev kaa bachaav kiya
 Shahnawaz Hussain said that Ramdev is a saintly man
 unhone angreji ke shabd kaa istemaal kiya
 Which has been interpreted incorrectly
 bijepi pravaktaa kaa kahana tha ki congress modi ke khilaaf anaap shanaap bolti rahati he
 Those people keep giving such statements
 congress ko chupchaap apni haar sweekaar kar leni chahie

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed an election rally in Fatehpur, UP on Sunday
 piem ne kaha ki shivaji ke sapane ko har hindustani seva ji banakar puraa karen
 The country is still saying today, it would have been better if Sardar Patel had been the first Prime Minister of the country
 70 saalon ke baad ham sahi nitiyaan lagu karke sardaar patel ke sapanom ko puraa kar sakate hai
 Modi said that after 14 years, the exile of development from Uttar Pradesh should also end

 i have come to seek blessings from you with the mantra of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas
 gaanv main kabristaan banataa he to shmashaan bhi bananaa chahie
 If electricity comes in Ramadan, it should also come in Diwali
 piem ne kaha ki tisare charan main bhi matadaata badlaav kaa man banaakar matdaan kar rahe hai
 The public knows this and knows everything, through publicity, people cannot throw dust in their eyes
 kuch log to saare desh main pit gaye, lekin upi main aakar apane sapanom ko saakaar karne main lage hai
 Those who were born with a spoon of gold gave the slogan of 27 years UP Behala

 The third phase is not even completed, but Akhilesh ji has lost his spirits

 The Gujarat government on Friday appointed three new parliamentary secretaries
 coli samudaay se hira solanki, dalit samudaay se punam makvana or surat ke shahari ilaake se poornesh modi
 The current government had appointed eight parliamentary secretaries in Gujarat just two days ago
 lekin is par andruni taur par virodh ke sur sunai dene lage the
 After all, the agitating Patel community got the post of state party president in addition to the post of deputy chief minister
 rashtriya str par ek hi parivaar ke do logon ko pad na dene kii duhai dene vaali bhaajapa ne gujarat main purushottam solanki ko rajyamantri banaaya tha to unke bhai hira solanki ko ab sansadeey sachiv kaa pad bhi mil gaya he
 The attempt is to save Koli, the largest voter group in the state, from resentment
 vikaas kii raajnneeti kii duhai dene vaali bhaajapa ne 25 mantriyon ke baavjood 11 sansadeey sachivon banaae hai
 This is being seen as the mathematics of generating caste equations
 yah isliye kyonki gujarat main sirf dalit hi nahin, anya samaajon ke bhi daliton se judane ke kaaran sarkaar ke khilaaf ek morcha banataa dikh rahaa he
 On the very first day of Una's Dalit Asmita Yatra from Ahmedabad, a large number of Muslims along with Dalits were also seen in it
 dalit andolan ke aguva jignesh mewaani ne saaf kar diya ki dalit asmita ke saath hi ve puure hindutv or jatvaad ke khilaaf sandesh lekar chal rahe hai
 He had said that the whole of India is in the grip of corporate groups today
 hindutvvaadi, manuaadi or jativaadee shaktiyon kii giraft main he
 To get rid of it, we will raise the question, what happened to the values of the constitution after so many years of independence? What happened to Dalits and the underprivileged in this Gujarat model, we want to put the question in front of the whole country
 tippaniyan Hardik Patel, who has been campaigning against the Gujarat government over the Patel reservation movement, has also announced the support of Dalits
 isiilie kai jagah hardik patel se jude patel netaaon ne bhi dalit yatra kaa swaagat kiya
 In the year 1985, there were caste riots in the anti-reservation riots which later became communal
 aisa dobaaraa na ho ise rokane ke liye muslim samudaay pehle se daliton ke sabhi andolanon main jud rahaa he or samarthan kii ghoshnaa ho rahaa he
 Muslim lawyer Shamshad Pathan had announced at the Dalit General Conference itself that Muslims from all over India are always standing with Dalits and will continue to stand with Dalits even further
 virodhiyon ke bad rahe is kunbe se maujuuda bhaajapa sarkaar thodi sakapakaai jarur he
 That is why within two days the caste equation forced him to make 11 parliamentary secretaries
 aise main pichley 16 saalon main pehali baar bhaajapa par jatigat sameekaran kaa dabaav haaavee hota dikh rahaa he or pradesh netritv kamjor
 At the national level, the BJP had made Purshottam Solanki the minister of state in Gujarat, who had been praying for not giving the post to two people of the same family, while his brother Heera Solanki has also got the post of parliamentary secretary
 koshish rajya main sabase bade matadaata samooh coli ko naaraazgi se bachaane kii he
 BJP has made 11 parliamentary secretaries despite 25 ministers, who have been calling for development politics
 ise jatigat sameekaran bithaane ke ganit ke taur par dekha ja rahaa he
 This is because not only Dalits in Gujarat, but other societies also join the Dalits, a front against the government seems to be forming
 ahmedabad se oona kii dalit asmita yatra ke pehle din hi isamen daliton ke saath badi sankhya main muslim bhi dikhe the
 Jignesh Mevani, the leader of the Dalit movement, made it clear that along with Dalit identity, he is carrying the message against Hindutva and casteism
 unhone kaha tha ki puraa bharat varsh aaj korporate grupon kii pakad main he
 Hindutva is under the grip of Manuwadi and casteist powers
 usase nijaat paane ke liye ham log yah sawaal khadaa karenge ki aazaadee ke itane saalon ke baad samvidhan ke mulyon kaa kya hua? is gujarat model main daliton or vanchiton kaa kya hua, yah sawaal ham puure desh ke saamne rakhana chaahate hai
 The comments patel aarakshan andolan ko lekar gujarat sarkaar ke khilaaf muhim chalaane vaale hardik patel ne bhi daliton ke samarthan kaa elaan kar diya he
 That is why Patel leaders associated with Hardik Patel in many places also welcomed the visit of Dalit
 saal 1985 main aarakshan virodh dangon main jatigat dange bhi hue the jo baad main sampradayik ho gaye the
 To prevent this from happening again, the Muslim community is already joining all the Dalit movements and a declaration of support is being made
 muslim vakil shamashaad pathan ne dalit mahasammelan main hi ghoshnaa kar di thi ki puure hindustan ke musalmaan hameshaa daliton ke saath khadey hai or aage bhi daliton ke saath khadey rahenge
 The current BJP government is definitely a bit shaky due to this growing clan of opponents
 isiilie do dinon ke bheetar hi jatigat sameekaran ne use 11 sansadeey sachiv banane ke liye majaboor kar diya
 In such a situation, for the first time in the last 16 years, the pressure of caste equations is dominating the BJP and the state leadership is weak
 vikaas kii raajnneeti kii duhai dene vaali bhaajapa ne 25 mantriyon ke baavjood 11 sansadeey sachivon banaae hai

 Kingfisher's Kangali, Air India losses and now spicejet land
 aap chaunk sakate hai ki ye sab tab ho rahaa he jab hamaara aviation sector salanaa 14% kii growth darj kar rahaa he
 Indian Aviation Industry ranks among the top-5 countries in the world
 desh kaa 30 fisadi air trephic non-metro shaharon se aa rahaa he, jiske kuch saalon main 45 fisadi tak pahunch jane kii ummid he
 200 small airports are to be built in the country
 to is laajawab growth story main kuch airline companiyaan dam kyon tod rahi hai? is saal main aisi companiyon kaa kul ghaataa 9 hajaar karod rupee tak pahunchane kii ashanka he
 There has been a lot of talk about the Kingfisher airline's reckless expenses, improper use of bank loans, conflict between management and employees
 air india kaa bedaa gark to sarkaar kii badaniyati or paison kii phijulkharchi ne kar diya
 There has been a lot of news that this government airline, which is under debt of Rs
 40 thousand crore, has incurred a loss of five thousand crore last year
 lekin is sabamein spicejet kaa maamla dilachasp he
 An airline that people considered to be economical and time-consuming
 aaie samajhate hai isaki barbaadi kii kahani
 Spice Jet exploded through its own lanes, takes an example first
 dilli se charkhi-dadri (haryana) 100 kilonmeter kii duuri par he
 Now if a bus driver can complete this journey for Rs 40, even if the transportation cost is Rs 50? However, sir, the bus will be packed in minutes

 isse company ko kareeb 500 karod rupee kii kamai hui
 But the expenditure is more than that

 If the number of passengers increased, it was expected that investors would also be attracted
 lekin aisa hua nahin
 Investors did not consider it safe to invest as the company's chief promoter Maran brothers (kalanidhi-dayanidhi) were caught in the aircel-maxis deal
 dayaanidhi ne pichley saal 200 karod lagaae, jo naakaafi rahe
 3
 aviation terbine ful
 This is the cost of 75% of any airline
 haalanki, sabhi airline companiyaan isaki mahangaai se jujh rahi hai, lekin ghate main dub rahe spicejet ke liye yah samasya tab or vikaraal ban gai jab tel companiyon ne shart rakh di ki spicejet ko cash par hi tel diya jayega

 Bully has two girls
 buli kaa pati dihadi majdoor he
 Bully's concern right now is that the orange season is coming to an end and then he will have to sit at home, so how will the living go
 aarthik tangahaali main bhi buli kaa teerandaji se lagaav kam nahin hua he
 Whenever she gets time, she teaches archery to the children at sidli-koshikotra Higher Secondary School
 chirang ke kisaan parivaar main janmi buli ko bachapan se hi teerandaji kaa shauk tha
 But due to the poor financial condition of the house, it was not possible for the bully to have access to modern archery equipment
 buli ne ghar main hi bane tir-kaman se is khel main dakshata hasil karnaa jari rakhaa
 The area where Buli was home has always been considered a disturbed area due to ethnic violence
 tamaam mushkilon ke baavjood buli ne apni sadhana jari rakhi
 He also got the result of this
 2005 main buli cosports athurity of india(sai) kii ore se yojit camp ke liye bulaava mila
 Bully did not look back when he got the right opportunity
 2004 main buli ne rajasthan ke ajmer me yojit sab junior neshnal teerandaji championships main do gold medal (30 meter, 20 meter) jite
 The following year, Bully won a gold medal at the School Games Federation of India
 isi saal amravati main yojit 51wein neshnal skool games main buli ko silver mila
 The golden opportunity came for Buli when he won the gold medal in the 50 meter event of the Senior National Archery Championship held in Jharkhand
 2008 main bhi buli ne isi championships main silver medal jeeta
 Bulli also won uncountable medals in state level competitions
 buli kii safaltaaon kaa silsilaa jari tha ki 2010 main chot kii vajah se is par viraam lag gaya
 Buli had to return to his home in Chirang from sai's training camp
 kuch maheene baad wo thik bhi ho gai lekin phir wo dobaaraa training camp main nahin laut saki
 At home too, Votirandaji's equipment could not continue training due to very expensive equipment
 phir buli kii shaadi ho gai
 Bully now has two daughters
 lekin pati ke dihadi majdoor hone kii vajah se do june kii roti jutanaa bhi mushkil ho rahaa tha
 In such a situation, the bully himself has to sell oranges on the roadside daily
 hairat kii baat he ki buli kii sarkaar yaa kisi bhi khel santhaan kii ore se ab tak sud nahin lee gai
 He did not get help from anywhere
 assam sarkaar tak buli kii kahani pahunchi to wo ab is par gaur karne kii baat kar rahi he
 If nothing else, a bully can be awarded a job as a coach

 ) krishi sankat or kisaanon kii badahaali ke mudde par lagaataar vipaksh ke hamale jhel rahi centre kii narendra modi sarkaar ne chunavi saal main apane aakhri or antarim bajet main kisaanon ke liye bada elaan kiya he
 In this budget, the government has promised to give Rs
 6000 per year to small and marginal farmers of the country
 sarkaar kaa yah daanv congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi kii ghoshnaa ke baad hindi pattee ke teen rajyon main navgathit congress sarkaron dwaara kisaanon kii karj maafee ke jawaab ke taur par dekha ja rahaa he
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi has often accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his rallies that the government forgives the debts of a few industrialists, but when it comes to loan waiver of farmers, it says that it is not our policy
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne haal hi main ek samachar agency ko die apane intervyuu main kisaanon kii karjamaafee ke mudde par kaha tha ki agar koi rajya apane sansadhano dwaara karj maafee karti he to kar sakati he
 But the government believes that the problem of farmers will not be solved by waiving debts but by strengthening them, by increasing their capacity
 desh main kisaanon kii kul aabaadi kaa 85 fisadi laghu evam seemaant kisaan hai
 These are farmers whose holdings are relatively low
 aise main sarkaar ne pradhanmantri kisaan sammaan nidhi kaa elaan kiya he, jiske liye 75,000 karod rupee kii raashi aavantit kii gai he
 At the same time, Rs 20,000 crore has been allocated for this financial year
 modi sarkaar kii is ghoshnaa ke tahat desh ke 2 hectare tak kii jot vaale kisaanon ko prativarsh 6000 rupee centre sarkaar kii taraf se sidhe unke bank khate main diya jayega
 In view of the cropped cycle, this amount will be transferred to the farmers' account in three installments
 modi sarkaar kii is yojana kaa laabh desh ke 12 karod kisaanon ko milegaa
 The scheme will be implemented from December 1, 2018, the first installment of which will be in the account of the farmers soon
 bataa den ki is tarah kii skim desh ke kuch rajyon main pehle se chal rahi he
 Of Telangana
 chandrashekhar raav sarkaar raitu bandhu yojana ke tahat krishi main nivesh-khaad, beej, kitnashak ityadi ke samarthan ke liye kisaanon ko 4000 rupee prati acre prati sijan detii he
 Apart from this, similar schemes are going on in Jharkhand and Odisha
 odisha sarkaar ne kaaliya yojana shuru kii he jiske tahat laghu evam seemaant kisaanon ko 10,000 rupee milte hai
 So at the same time, the Jharkhand government is going to give Rs 5000 per acre to 23 lakh middle and marginal farmers of the state from this financial year
 vahiin, pashchim bengal ne rajya main khetihar mazdooron or kisaanon ke liye do yojanaon kii ghoshnaa kii he jisamen kisaanon ko do kishton main 5000 rupee prati acre bhugtan kii baat kahi gai he
 The central government has also tried to hit two targets with one stone through this scheme
 gauratlab he ki congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne chhattisgarh main kisaan aabhaar raily ko sambodhit karte hue elaan kiya ki centre main congress sarkaar aane par desh ke garibon ko nunatam aamadani sunishchit karne ke liye yojana laai jaaegi
 Rahul had said that this would be the first such scheme in his kind of world
 ab modi sarkaar ne kisaanon kii bahut badi aabaadi ko ek nishchit raashi dene kaa vaayada karte hue krishi sankat par ban rahe maahaul or universal basic inakam- donon pahaluon ko chune kaa prayaas karti dikh rahi he

 Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has written a blog on Congress President Rahul Gandhi
 blog kii shuruyaat jetali ne court-kachhari main senior vakil dwaara junior vakil ko di jane vaali salaah se kii
 Jaitley said that it is explained to the junior lawyer that if you are strong in evidence then only take the evidence
 yadi kanoon main aap paarangat hai to kanoon kaa sahaara len
 At the same time, if you are weak in both, then work to beat the table
 junior vakeelon kii di jane vaali is salaah ke sahare arun jetali ne kaha ki rahul gandhi ke salaahkaar unhen sirf tisare vikalp ke liye uparyukt bana rahe hai
 Jaitley further writes that just beating the table in politics will not work, so Rahul Gandhi's advisors are creating a fictional truth for him which has nothing to do with the truth
 vitt mantri jetali likhte hai ki rahul gandhi kaa maananaa he ki aisi juthi baton ko itani baar kaha jaae ki unhen khud vah ek sachai lagane lage
 Due to this, he will remain in illusion and be happy
 iske saath hi jetali likhte hai ki rahul gandhi ne is manovriti kaa parichay apane bhaashanon or twit main diya he
 Then the Finance Minister describes 5 such occasions in favor of his argument when Rahul Gandhi was found doing so
 pehla:rahul gandhi baar-baar kah rahe hai ki privet bijness gharaanon ko 38000 karod rupee se lekar 1,30,000 karod rupee kaa phayda pahunchaa he
 Then Rahul Gandhi claims that the fighter aircraft that HAL had to build is now going to such a private sector company that has no experience in this work
 sachai:rafel kaa nirmaan bharat main nahin hone ja rahaa he
 Neither by Dasha nor by any other private company
 kharide gaye sabhi 36 vimaan puri taiyaari ke saath bharat laayaa jayega
 At the same time, under the agreement with the company, half the price of the total agreement will have to be purchased in India
 iske tahat desh main 120 ofaset saplir hai or charchaa main chal rahi company bhi unamem se ek he
 At the same time, in the current situation, the said company will get only 3 percent of the total agreement, whose estimated value will be just Rs 1000 crore
 doosraa:rahul gandhi baar-baar kehete hai ki jab kisi karj ko enpie ghoshit kar diya jaataa he tab use karjamaafee kaha jayega
 After this, Rahul claims that the Prime Minister helped 15 of his friends through debt waiver
 sachai:ye corporate karj upie kaarykaal main die gaye
 Of this, an apology of one rupee has not been given
 aisi companiyon ke pramotaron ko bankerpsi kanoon ke tahat baahar kar diya gaya he or bank inase apana duba hua paisa safaltaapurvak nikaal rahe hai
 Third: Rahul Gandhi first asks why mobile phones are not being produced in India
 sachai:unke sawaal par unhen bataaya gaya ki congress kaarykaal main mahaj 2 companiyaan mobile bana rahi thi vahiin maujuuda samay main 120 companiyaan mobile manuphaccharing main lagi hai
 After this, Rahul Gandhi is asking a new question as to why shoes and slippers are not being manufactured in the country
 chauthaa:rahul gandhi baar-baar daawa karte hai ki jiesti main khamiyaan hai
 Truth: GST has been launched very successfully in the country and the whole country has become a market
 vahiin congress shasit rajyon samet sabhi rajyon ne jiesti sudhaar ke saath chalane kaa kaam kiya he
 Click here to read Jaitley's blog in English ucchtam nyaayalay ne spasht kiya he ki aise sahjivan (liv-in relationships) se, jahaan purush or stri lambey samay tak pati-patni ke rup main saath rahen hon, janm lene vaali santan ko avaidh nahin kaha ja saktaa he
 a division bench of Justice BS Chauhan and Justice j Chelameswar gave this clarification on a plea of a lawyer against the Madras High Court verdict
 ucch nyaayalay ke nirnay main sahjivan ke bare main kuch tippaniyan kii gai thim
 Advocate Uday Gupta had said in the petition that the High Court's comment is not legally justified that a valid marriage does not necessarily mean that the married couple will have to follow all the traditional rites and then lawfully edit them
 sheersh adaalat ne yachika kaa nibatara karte hue kaha ki vah is maamle main or vichaar karnaa aavashyak nahin samajhati he
 The judges said, 'we are of the opinion that these comments have been made on the facts of the case presented
 vastav main, nyaayadhish kahana chaahate the ki yadi purush or stri lambey samay tak ek saath pati patni ke rup main rahete hai, bhale hi kabhi shaadi nahin kii ho, to ise vivaah hi mana jayega or unke paidaa hone vaali santan avaidh nahin kahi ja sakati he
 ' nyaayalay ne 2010 ke madan mohan singh banaam rajnikant prakaran kaa zikr karte hue kaha ki isi drushtikon ko kai faislon main doharaaya gaya he

 If you want to get a government job, then there are many opportunities, for more information, read JOB ALERT of November 3
 bharat electronic limited main vaikency, selary 50500 rupaeuttar pradesh power corporation limited (UPPCL) main vaikencipunjab agriculture uniwarsity main vaikencibandhai main naukari paane kaa mauka In this way no one is perfect, but in our partner, we seek all the best
 vaise to kaha jaataa he ki is maamle main ladkiyaan zyada demanding hoti hai lekin sach yah he ki ladke bhi garlfriend chunate samay bahut sari baton par dhyaan dete hai
 The image of an ideal girlfriend in the minds of boys is based on a few things
 vah chaahate hai ki unki partner dekhne main khubasurat to ho hi, vyavhaar main bhi bahut sulajhi hui or paripakv ho
 Apart from these things, they also seek more qualities in their girlfriends
 jaaniye kya hai wo 6 baaten, jo har ladkaa apni adarsh garlfriend main dekhnaa chahta he -1:adarsh garlfriend apane bwoyfriend ko bina pareshaan kiye khud shopping par jaati hai
 Boys are usually less fond of shopping
 aise main jab ladkiyaan shopping par saath chalane ko kahati hai to ladakon ko bahut pareshaani hoti he
 Especially then, when girls drill 50 shops to buy one thing according to habit or what should i do, i am irritating them with questions like what i am looking fat
 2:ladakon ko hameshaa aisi garlfriend kii khwaahish hoti he jo unke or unke parivaar ke mutabik khud ko dhaal le
 They want girls to give as much love and respect to their family as their families
 3:ladke hameshaa yah khwaahish rakhte hai ki unhen aisi garlfriend mili jo doston ke saath unke nithouts par aitraaj na kare
 Most girls are irritated by these types of boys' plans
 haalanki isaki vajah yah he ki unako lagata he ki ladke unase zyada mahatv apane doston ko de rahe hai
 4: It is always said that the path of the heart passes through the stomach and boys also follow this theory
 ve chaahate hai ki unki garlfriend ko dusron se behatar khaanaa bananaa aata ho or vah pyaar va khushi se unke liye khaanaa banaae
 5: Boys may not say this, but it is true that while eating out, sharing the bills of girls or paying them several times makes them happy
 duusare shabdon me kahen to ladke hameshaa yahi chaahate hai ki unhen aisi garlfriend mili jo unki jeb zyada dhili na kare
 6: One of the biggest fantasies that every boy makes about ideal girlfriends is that their girlfriends don't interrupt them while flirting with another girl
 is par ladakon kaa hameshaa yahi tark hota he ki kisi or ladki se thodi baat karne main kya dikkat he
 Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Wednesday, in Indore in Madhya Pradesh, the electoral state, accused the Center and the BJP government of the state of making promises
 centre sarkaar par rojgaar kaa vaada puraa nahin karne kaa aarope lagaaya
 Asked about Prime Minister Narendra Modi's aggressive tone and the dignity of the Prime Minister's post in his speech on rhetoric against opposition leaders, Manmohan Singh said that Narendra Modi is not using the Prime Minister's post properly
 vah jis tarah se bolte hai unako shobhaa nahin detaa
 Especially when he goes to Congress ruled states, he speaks a lot there which is not right
 unhen pad kii garima rakhni chahie
 Speaking on demonetisation of demonetisation loot, former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said, 'I had already said in Parliament that it is part of organized loot
 ' jabaki jiesti par unhone kaha ki ise bagaiyr puri taiyaari or khaas yojana ke saath lagu kiya gaya
 Manmohan Singh, who led the UPA government at the Center for 10 years, dismissed the claim of calling himself a remote government and said that the effort of our government was to take everyone along
 ham sabko saath lekar chale, yahi kaaran rahaa ki sarkaar or party ke bich kisi tarah kaa koi antar nahin rahaa
 Promising employment Khokhlan Mohan Singh attacked the Modi government at the Center, saying that in 2014 Modi had promised 2 crore jobs in the country every year, but today that promise could not be fulfilled
 shram vibhaag se mili jaankaree ke anusaar, har timahi main mahaj kuch hajaar hi naukari mil saki he
 The government's promise of employment turned out to be hollow
 madhya pradesh ke yuvaaon ko bhi rojgaar nahin mil rahaa
 He criticized the central government and said that Modi ji had promised to give 15 lakh rupees to everyone's bank account, but what happened about it
 modi sarkarabhrashtachar ko badhaava de rahi he
 We had demanded JPC on the Rafale deal, but nothing has happened so far

 The state government has failed to meet the farmers' problems
 rajya main vyapam jaisaa mahaghotaalaa hua
 He said that our government had never discriminated against any government
 hamane madhya pradesh ke saath kabhi bhedbhaav nahin kiya, shivaraj singh chouhan iske gavaah hai
 Regarding the Rafale deal, the former Prime Minister targeted the central government and said that the Rafale case, the dal, appears to be black
 isaki nishpaksh jaanch kii jaani chahie
 JPC should be constituted for investigation
 rafel ko lekar congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi lagaataar pradhanmantri narendra modi par hamalaa karte rahe hai

 # deepikapadukone # mychoiceone of the worst feminism video i have seen
 Makes no sense
 Complete bullshit
 Watch @ emwatsonspeech instead

 In such a situation, people are now raising the question whether any woman would like her husband to have a relationship with someone else after marriage? a man can also marry of his own accord and having a child is not a one-sided decision, rather it depends on the will of both men and women
 deepika ne video main yah bhi kaha he ki ek aurat kii marji he ki vah sies jiro hona chaahati he yaa sies 15
 Taking a dig at Deepika for this argument, people are asking why Deepika, who talks about the size of a woman, herself does weight loss ads

 As of now, no comments have been made by Deepika on these criticisms

 It is worth noting that spiritual court and narrator Asaram has been convicted by the Jodhpur court in the rape case of a minor girl
 2013 main asaram ke khilaaf upi ke shahjahanpur kii rahane vaali ek naaballig ladki ne rape kaa sansanikhej aarope lagaaya tha

 Who would say that Bhosadiyala? If you are going abroad, should you give up your culture? The boys of his house still wear a lungi and drive a scooter, watch a movie, walk around Sarnath
 rickshaw achaanak ruk gaya
 The chain had landed
 rickshawvaale ne chen chadhaayi or phir chal padaa
 The road was very bad
 jagah-jagah gittiyaan nikal aayi thim or gadde ban gayi the
 When there was a rickshaw wheel in a pit, Haji Amirulla felt that now he would reverse and he would get scared
 lekin rickshaw phir sanbhal jaataa
 They would then fade away and start thinking
 resham bahut mahanga ho gaya he
 How will the business run? Ever since Haji Amirulla has expanded his business, this is the only concern that is being fed to him how the business will run? Haji Amirulla has now reduced the loom and has replaced the powerlooms
 'sosayadi' ko sarkaar se jo sattar hajaar rupee mili the, haji sahab ne unka sadupyog powerlooms banane main hi kiya he
 Although latif-watif had a slight slap, Sharafuddinwa was so enraged that he was silenced in one stroke
 phir kisi kii himmat nahin padi
 Powerlooms are very easy to install
 yahi nahin, ab is koaparative sosayadi ke madhyam se chunki unka maal sidhe export hone laga he, isliye maal bhi zyada taiyaar karana padataa he
 Although a weaver used to prepare a sari in at least four days, now a powerloom - if there is electricity - produces four saris in a day
 haalaanki in saadiyon main waisi kaarigari or nakkashi nahin hoti, par aamadani zyada he
 There are no common buyers of 'banarasi Sarees' anymore - and everyone buys these saris exclusively
 lekin karghe puri tarah khatm nahin hue hai
 Some looms are still moving
 dukaan main har tarah kaa maal hona chahie
 Rather, he has started a new business to Sharafuddin
 vah apane khaali vakt main chaape kii saadiyaan taiyaar karwaata he or anguthiyon main laganevaale nagon kaa kaarobaar bhi ab shuru karanevaala he
 Wherever you see in Benaras, there are now powerloom-powerloom
 har chote-bade giris ne apane yahan powerloom laga rakhaa he
 The world is making rapid progress
 bunakaron kii galiyon main raat-raat-bhar powerloom chalaa karte hai
 xxwrep 5 Khatar An endless train like train is going
 haji amirulla ke yahan das powerloom lage hue hai
 Haji Matiullah, Haji Minister and Habibullah have also placed powerlooms in their respective homes
 udhar haji amirulla ke bhavi samadhi haji valiulla giris ke yahan to pehle se hi kai powerloom the, idhar or aa gayi hai or ko ve gine chune rais ansaariyon main ab apana mahatvapurn sthaan bana chuke hai
 He considers himself Lat Swaleh (a nobleman of Benaras) of Alaipura area
 haji raseed, haji samtullah, haji nazeer or boul dabba aadi ne bhi apane-apane yahan powerloom baitha liye hai
 In this way, an endless train now runs continuously in the entire area and sleeps the locals
 lekin haji amirullah ko isse kya lenaa-dena he? unki to pehali mahatvapurn chintaa yah he ki resham kaa bhav kaise neeche gire? iske liye unke sadprayaason se pichley dinon banaras, maunath bhanjan or mubarakapur ke anek bunakaron ne hadtaal bhi kar di thi or unki haalat or khasta ho gayi thi
 But there is no significant difference yet
 is hamale ko lekar sansad main sawaal uthaaya janevaala tha, pataa nahin kya hua? agar kaarobaar thik-thaak jam gaya to is saal do kaam karne hai
 Habibullah is to be sent for Haj and to marry Sharafuddin
 
 
 abhi ve kuch or bhi sochate, lekin rickshaw unke darvaaze par pahunch gaya or ve utar pade
 On landing, his lungi got stuck somewhere in the rickshaw and exploded
 koi baat nahin
 The children of the house made noise for a while upon seeing Haji Saheb getting off the rickshaw, then the Agra people were silent after eating the petha
 haji sahab pakhaana gayi
 Sitting there for some time, kept thinking
 phir baahar nikalakar unhone snaan kiya or naashtaa karke gaddi par aa baithe
 Sharafuddin kept newspapers for several days in front of him
 'aaj', 'dainik jaagran' or 'kaumi ekta'
 "where is Kamaruva Gava Bay?" "gangaji is Gawa, Nahee
 'haji sahab apane sawaal ke uttar se thodaa asantusht hue or ek-ek akhbaar uthaa-uthaakar sarsari taur par dekhne lage
 Haji Sahib knows very little Hindi, but the part-time students study
 achaanak ‘dainik jaagran’ main chape ek samachar par unki drushti keel kii tarah gad gayi
 He began to read the news with glee, 'the discussion of the weavers of silk cloth of Varanasi', New Delhi, 28 November
 kendra sarkaar ne sweekaar kiya he ki uttar pradesh main varanasi ke handloom silk udyog ko reshmi dhaagon ke mulya main hui asaadhaaran vruddhi ke parinamswaroop sankat kaa saamana karnaa padaa he
 This confession has been made by the Union Minister of State for Commerce Khurshid Alam Khan in response to the question of Janul Bashar (ghazipur) of Congress (E) in Lok Sabha yesterday
 'shri khan ne bataaya ki kachche resham kii keemat main anek kaarnon se vruddhi hui he, jaise ek ore to sookhe kii sthiti or urja sankat kii vajah se karnataka main utpaadan main kami or duusari ore hathkargha tathaa vidyut kargha kshetron main kachche resham kii maatra main vruddhi
 To cope with the present situation, the Government of India has decided to import metric tons of silk through the Central Silk Board
 iske saath hi sambandhit rajya sarkaar ke vibhinn vikaas-kaaryakramon ke antargat aane vaale maheenon main urja sankat ko kam karne tathaa utpaadan badhaane ke liye kadam uthaaye ja rahe hai
 'mr
 Khan also informed the questioner that the Central Government has decided to provide central assistance of Rs nine crore to the Government of Uttar Pradesh to encourage the development of silk industry during the Sixth Five Year Plan period
 'haji sahab kaa dil khush ho gaya
 Bashir Saheb raised this question in Parliament
 milkiyon kaa kya bharosa ? milky kahe na dil kii! phir jalaahon se to inhen dili nafrat- he
 Hey, there was a time when the village weavers used to offer chicks on their hooks and now it has come a time that if the weavers of Benaras want to keep milkmen as servants
 bhala kaise bardaasht hoga yah sab? lekin bhai haan, kahana hoga bashar sahab bahut aalaa aadmi hai
 Haji Amirullah, M
 of man-he-man Ghazipur
 pi
 Praised Zainul Bashar and started watching 'aaj' issue
 unhen 'aaj' main bhi isi tarah kii ek khabar mil gayi or ve use bhi atak-atak kar dhyanpurvak padhane lage-‘bunakaron kii dayaneey sthiti kii rajyasabha main charchaa’'nayi dilli, 2 disambar
 Shri Balraj Mishra, a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party, today drew attention to the pathetic condition of about five and a half lakh weavers in Varanasi, Mubarakpur and adjoining the special mention rule in the Rajya Sabha, requesting that the prices of silk silk yarn increase wildly Due to this, sixty thousand handlooms have been affected
 'shri mishra ne kaha ki pichley maas paanch lakh banakaron ne hadtaal kii thi, jiske kaaran unke saamne jivan-yaapan kii samasya gambhir ho gai he
 This situation occurred due to the sudden increase in the value of silk silk yarn by sixty rupees per kilogram from eight hundred fifty rupees to nine hundred rupees
 ‘unhone kaha ki karnataka rajya se reshmi silk yarn kii kharid hoti thi tathaa uskaa kray-vikray nirdhaarit depo ke madhyam se hota tha, jiske kaaran bunakaron ko kisi prakaar kii kathinaayee nahin hoti thi, kintu sarkaar ne is samay ekadhikaaravaadi manovriti se prerit hokar nilaamee-pranali ke madhyam se karnataka main resham khareednaa sharu kar diya
 'due to the highest production of silk in Karnataka, the government adopted the above method, due to which some capitalists have bought and collected silk
 parinamswaroop iske mulya main vruddhi hui he
 Haji Amirullah was pleased after reading the news
 paksh or vipaksh donon ore se sawaal uth rahe hai, jaldi hi iskaa phayda hoga- unhone sochaa, aashwast hue, phir gaddi se uthakar upar gayi or taiyaar hokar seth gajadhar prasad ke yahan jane ke liye seedhiyaan utarane lage

 28 july lagbhag 5 baje ke kareeb chandramaa puri tarah se prithvi kii viral chaaya se baahar nikal jayega
 At the time of lunar eclipse, the moon will look brighter and larger, in which the shadow of the middle region of the earth will fall on the moon
 chandra grahan puri duniya main ek saath hi shuru hota he or ek saath hi khatm hota he
 But it depends on what time of night is going on there
 kahin shaam ko chandroday ke vakt yaa uske baad dikhegaa or kahin subah chandrast ke aas-paas hoga lekin bharat kii baat karen to yahaan par chandra grahan madhya raatri main shuru ho rahaa he
 Therefore, it will start simultaneously and end simultaneously in all places of the country
 ye he sutak kaa samay (sutak timing for Chandra Grahan)yah grahan 3 ghanta 55 minute kaa he
 The eclipse touch is at night 11: 54 minutes, mid-night at 1:52 and salvation time is at 3:49 minutes
 chandra grahan kaa sutak kaal din main 2:54 par lag gaya he
 Whatever auspicious task is, it is best to do all the work before the Sutak period, because today is also Guru Purnima
 atah sabhi log guru poornima ke nimitt jo bhi dharmik kriyaayein karte hai, vah sutak kaal ke pehle arthath 2:54 minute ke andar hi dharmik kaary kerani chahie
 Difference between lunar eclipse and solar eclipse prithvi kii chaaya chandramaa kii chaaya se bahut zyada badi hoti he, jis kaaran surya grahan ke mukaable chandragrahan zyada lambey samay tak rahata he
 What is Chandra Grahan When the Earth comes between the Sun and the Moon, the entire light of the Sun does not fall on the Moon
 ise chandragrahan kehete hai
 a lunar eclipse occurs when the Sun, Earth and Moon are in a simple line
 chandragrahan hameshaa poornima kii raat main hi hota he
 a lunar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes through the shadow of the Earth maximum three times in a year
 suryagrahan kii tarah hi chandragrahan bhi aanshik or purna ho saktaa he
 Why does a lunar eclipse occur? (what Causes Chandra Grahan) The simple answer to this is that the arrival of the moon in the earth's gorge
 us sthiti main surya ek taraf, chandramaa duusari taraf or prithvi bich main hoti he
 a lunar eclipse occurs when the moon comes out of the Earth's shadow
 chandramaa purna chandra grahan ke vakt laal rang main hi kyon dikhataa he? (what is blood moon? why moon turns red)surya kii roshni jab prithvi ke vaataavaran kii vibhinn paraton se guzarati he to roshni ke saat rang alag-alag kone par bikhar jate hai
 In these, the red part of the spectrum turns slightly higher
 surya kii yahi roshni chandramaa kii sataha par sabase pehle pahunchati he, jis kaaran chandramaa purna grahan ke samay puri tarah se vilupt nahin hota, balki laal rang main hamen najar aata he
 At the time of full lunar eclipse, the brightness of the moon decreases by 500 times compared to the normal full moon
 chandragrahan kaa raashi par asar (effect on all zodiac signs)grahan kaa prabhaav lagbhag 120 din tak rahata he
 There is also a need to take special vigilance from a lunar cycle ie Gurupurnima to Shravan Purnima
 is chandragrahan kaa sabase zyada prabhaav prithvi tatv kii raashi makar par hoga kyonki isi raashi main chandragrahan hoga
 Also, the eclipses of Aries, Leo, Scorpio and Pisces will benefit
 vrish raashi, mithun, kark, kanya, tula, dhanu, makar evam kumbh raashi ke jaatakon ko grahan se nuksaan ho saktaa he
 Does lunar eclipse fall on full moon day? (chandra Grahan on full moon) Lunar eclipse falls on the full moon day but not every full moon has a lunar eclipse
 iskaa kaaran he ki prithvi kii kaksha par chandramaa kii kaksha kaa jhuke hona
 This inclination is about 5 degrees so each time the moon does not enter the Earth's shadow
 uske upar yaa neeche se nikal jaataa he
 The same is true for solar eclipse
 surya grahan hameshaa amavasya ke din hote hai kyonki chandramaa kaa aakaar prithvi ke aakaar ke mukaable lagbhag 4 guna kam he
 Its shadow is of small size on the earth, so in the state of perfection, solar eclipse can be seen only from a small part of the earth
 lekin chandra grahan kii sthiti main dharti kii chaaya chandramaa ke mukaable kaaphi badi hoti he
 So it takes more time for the moon to pass through it
 kahaan se dikhegaa chandragrahan- (when and How to Watch Chandra Grahan)bharat ke alaava yah chandragrahan africa, dakshin asia, australia or dakshin america se dikhaai degaa
 But in India, this lunar eclipse will be seen from beginning to end
 yahaan par dekhen live- (chandra Grahan live or chandra grahan video)chandragrahan garbhvatee mahilaayein ye upaay karen (pregnant women precautions for Chandra Grahan)hindu dharm ke saath-saath duusare dharmon main bhi chandragrahan ko lekar kai tarah kii puranic manyataayen he
 The lunar eclipse is considered inauspicious for pregnant women
 manyata he ki chandragrahan se garbh main pal rahe shishu ko kai tarah se nuksaan pahunch sakate hai
 Therefore, pregnant women are advised to take special precautions during eclipse
 aaie jaanate hai jyotishiya manyata ke hisaab se, chandragrahan ke bure prabhaav se bachane ke liye grahan ke dauraan garbhvatee mahilaon ko kya saavdhaanee baratani chahie
 During lunar eclipse, pregnant women are advised to stay indoors
 mana jaataa he ki chandragrahan ke samay garbh main pal rahe bachche kii jaan ko khatra rahata he
 Pregnant women should not use any sharp or edged things during lunar eclipse
 aisi manyata he ki grahan ke dauraan subjiyan or fal kaatna bachche ke liye khatarnaak sabit ho saktaa he
 Pregnant women should avoid eating anything during the lunar eclipse
 chandragrahan ke samay jitna ho sake, garbhvatee mahilaon ko aaraam karne kii salaah di jaati he
 Do not wear metal items such as sari pins, hairpin and jewelery etc
 desh ke share bazaar ke shuruaati kaarobaar main buudhvaar ko majbootee kaa rukh bana hua he

 dabaavon ke baavjood apane rukh par kaayam rahete hue bharat ne sanyukt raashtra main sadsyta paane ke philistin ke daawey samarthan kiya or iran ke saath apane sambandhon ke liye patibaddhta doharaai
 His opinion on both these issues is completely different from that of America
 america virodh ke baavjood bharat ne philistin ke anurodh kaa samarthan philistini raashtrapati mahmud abbaas dwaara shuukravaar ko sanyukt raashtra main ek swatantra raashtra ke rup main apane desh kii sadsyta kii daavedaari kiye jane ke chand ghante baad vyakt kiya
 Indian Foreign Secretary Ranjan Mathai on Friday indicated that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, during his address to the United Nations General Assembly, may support this demand for Palestine
 mathai ne pradhanmantri ke bhaashan ke prati purvavlokan karne se inkaar karne ke baavjood unhone kaha, "philistin ke bare main hamaara rukh spasht he
 It is well known that we recognized Palestine as a separate nation only in 1988
 yadi ham apana rukh doharaate hai to isamen aashcharya nahin hona chahie
 "he told that in the meeting of Abbas this historic claim a few hours after Manmohan Singh and Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the two leaders reiterated their support for Palestine's membership of the United Nations
 isi tarah, sanyukt raashtra mahasabha main iran ke raashtrapati mahmud ahmadinejad ke aakraamak bhaashan ke ek din baad pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne iran ke saath kareebi sambandhon ke liye patibaddhta doharaate hue unase bhent kii
 During Ahmadinejad's speech at the General Assembly, representatives of the us-led Western countries went out
 bharat ke videsh sachiv ranjan mathai ne shuukravaar ko samvaadadaataaon ko bataaya, "yah mulaakaat purv nirdhaarit thi or yah mukhya rup se dwipaksheeya sambandhon par kendrit thi
 "correspondents wanted to know from Mathai that India's support to Palestine and meeting Ahmadinejad would have an impact on his relationship with the US
 mathai ne kaha ki ahmadinejad se mulaakaat, philistin kaa samarthan karne tathaa america raashtrapati baraak obama se mulaakaat na karne kaa arth bharat or america ke rishton main thandapan aane kaa sanket nahin he
 Like other Indian officials, Mathai also cited the reason for Manmohan Singh and Obama not meeting, saying that the Prime Minister arrived here after Obama left from New York
 lekin somvaar ko manmohan singh ke swadesh ravaanaa ho jane ke baad usee din bharat or america ke videsh mantriyon kii vaarta ho sakati he
 In the mouthpiece 'saamana' about the formation of government in Maharashtra, the attack on BJP 'samana' wrote - Seeing the new equations forming, many people started having pain in the stomach, the way for the formation of Shiv Sena, Congress and NCP government in Maharashtra has almost cleared
 kaaman minimum program (CMP) bhi ban gaya he
 The 14-14-12 formula for ministers between the Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress has also been decided
 saath hi yah bhi tay ho gaya he ki mukhyamantri shivasena kaa hi hoga
 Meanwhile, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has once again claimed to form the government in Maharashtra
 vahiin, shivasena ke mukhpatr 'saamana' ne bijepi par nishaanaa sadhate hue ek lekh chapa he
 The mouthpiece 'saamana' has written that the new equation in Maharashtra has caused some stomach pain
 koun vaise sarkaar banaata he dekhtaa hum, is prakaar kii bhashaa bole ja rahe hai, shraap bhi die ja rahe hai ki agar sarkaar ban bhi gai to vaise or kitne din tikegi, dekhte hai
 Such a 'future' is also being told that the government will not last more than 6 months
 ye nayaa dhandha laabhadaayak bhale ho, lekin ye andhashraddha kanoon kaa ulanghan he
 'samana' dangerous to the health of 105 people, while targeting the BJP, wrote that this act is coming in front of Maharashtra to hide its weakness
 ham maharashtra ke maalik hai or desh ke baap hai, aisa kisi ko lagata hoga to ve is maansikta se baahar aaen
 This mental state is dangerous for the health of 105 people
 aisi sthiti zyada samay rahi to maansik santulan bighad jayega or paagalpan kii ore yatra shuru ho jaaegi
 We do not feel right to prove the leader who came yesterday to be mad or stupid
 ek to narendra modi jaise netaa ke naam par unka khel shuru he or isamen modi kaa hi naam kharaab ho rahaa he
 'saamana' wrote, President's rule has been imposed in Maharashtra and after the imposition of President's rule, the confidence of 105 people is emerging as foam as if the waves of the Arabian Sea off Mumbai are bouncing
 purv mukhyamantri fadanvis ne apane vidhayakon ko badi vinamrata se kaha ki bindaas raho, rajya main phir se bhaajapa kii hi sarkaar aa rahi he
 Yesterday, BJP national president Amit Shah said that the state which has a figure of 145 will come to the government and it is constitutionally correct
 '105 vaale rajyapal se milakar saaf kar chuke hai''saamana' ne aage likhaa, ab jo aisa kah rahe hai ki ab bhaajapa kii sarkaar aegi ve 105 vaale pehle hi rajyapal se milakar saaf kah chuke hai ki hamaare paas bahumat nahin he, isliye sarkaar banane main ham asamarth hai, aisa kehane vaale raashtrapati shashan lagate hi 'ab sirf hamaari sarkaar he' ye kis munh se kah rahe hai? jo bahumat unke paas pehle nahin tha wo bahumat raashtrapati shashan ke silbatte se vaise baahar nikalegaa? yah sawaal to he hi lekin ham loktantr or naitikta kaa khun kar 'aankada' jod sakate hai, jaisi bhashaa maharashtra kii parampara ko shobhaa nahin detii
 Then any party that speaks like this
 raashtrapati shashan kii aad main ghodabazar lagane kaa mansuba ab saaf ho gaya he
 Warriors like Napoleon and Alexander also came and went
 Samana wrote, this is a lie of those who promise to work clean and transparent and this is being proved again and again
 satta yaa mukhyamantri pad kaa amarpatta lekar koi janm nahin letaa
 Warriors such as Napoleon and Alexander, who called themselves World Universities, also came and went
 shriram ko bhi rajya chhodana padaa
 Aurangzeb was finally buried in the ground, so why the rhetoric of being invincible? On one hand, Fadnavis claims 'bjp-only government in the state' and on the other hand Nitin Gadkari has thrown cricket's rabri ball into politics
 cricket or raajnneeti kaa aakhri kuch nahin hota
 The decision may change at any moment
 ek samay haath se nikle mukaable main jeet mil sakati he', aisa siddhant gadakari ne jaahir kiya he
 'gadkari has no connection with cricket' Samana further wrote, Gadkari has no connection with cricket
 unka sambandh cement, ithenul or koltar aadi vastuon se he
 Sharad Pawar and cricket are concerned
 ab party ke adhyaksh amit shah ke bete jai shah bhartiya cricket board ke sachiv ban gaye hai, isliye bhaajapa kaa cricket se adhikrut sambandh joda gaya he
 Gadkari says that there is no confidence in what will happen in cricket till the end
 aajkal cricket khel kam or dhandha zyada ban gaya he or cricket ke khel main bhi raajnneeti kii tarah 'ghodabazar' shuru he
 There is speculative market thrust in politics
 aise hi cricket main bhi shuru ho jane se 'jod-tod' or 'phixing' kaa wo khel maidan main shuru ho gaya he, isliye vahaan khel kii jeet hoti he yaa phixing jitati he ise lekar sanshay rahata hi he
 Therefore, it is right to name the political game of Maharashtra as an exciting game of cricket by Gadkari
 'chillane waalon kaa maansik santulan bigadega''saamana' ne likhaa raajnneeti main jisase tatasth nirnay kii apeksha hoti he us 'panch' ke duusare se mil jane (yaa mila liye jane se) aashaa jaagrit hogi hi 'ab hamaari hi sarkaar' jaisaa aatmavishvaas isi se jaagaa hoga, lekin maidan par stump naam kaa danda he
 The public will not be there without putting it in your head
 'phir se hamaari sarkaar' jaisi chillaahat maharashtra ke kaan ke parade faad rahi he
 In this way the public will become deaf, but the mental balance of the shouters will deteriorate
 hamen chintaa he, maharashtra main paaglon kii sankhya badhane kii khabar rajya kii pratishtha main baadhak he
 We give them all loving advice again, do not apply it so heartily
 'maanav kaa putr jagat main paradheen he' jaise satya he vaise hi koi ajey nahin he ye bhi satya he
 Satya's saffron will be waved in Maharashtra

 Prime Minister of Pakistan Nawaz Sharif is not able to solve the problems of his country, but is trying to solve the issue of Kashmir
 aaj pakistan adhikrut kashmir main navaj sharif ne bharat ko khub khari khoti sunai or baad main baatcheet ke jariye is samasya kaa hal nikaalane kii baat bhi kahi
 Pakistan celebrates Kashmir Solidarity Day on 5 February and on that day there is a government holiday
 is avasar par navaj sharif paak adhikrut kashmir pahunche or unhone vahaan aaazaad jammu or kashmir vidhaan sabha main bhaashan diya
 He warned that if Kashmir issue is not resolved, then there will be similar fighting
 pakistan ke akhbaar don ne yah khabar di he
 He said that the government and the people of Pakistan are celebrating Kashmir Solidarity Day
 ham is avasar par kashmiri janata ke sangharsh ko samarthan dete hai
 He alleged that the people of Kashmir are being tortured
 unhen kuchlaa ja rahaa he or unke saath amanviya vyavhaar ho rahaa he
 He said in open words that inhuman atrocities are being committed on the people of Kashmir
 sharif ne yah bhi aarope lagaaya ki hajaaron kashmiriyon kii jaan ja chuki he or hajaaron bharat kii jelon main band hai
 He also said that the Kashmiri people want to determine their fate according to the United Nations Charter
 unhone kaha ki pakistan kashmiri janata ke sangharsh main saath detaa rahegaa
 But later Sharif cooled down a bit and asked India to have a full and fruitful dialogue with Pakistan on this issue
 unhone kaha ki donon desh shantipurna dhang se is mudde ko sulajhaayen
 Ever since the formation of Pakistan, Kashmir has been an issue for the leaders of the state, which they always use politically
 jab bhi ve apane desh kii samasyaayein sulajhane main asafal hote hai to kashmir kaa masalaa uthaa dete hai
 This is the reason why Nawaz Sharif has also taken up this matter with full force this year
 vah bhi garibi, ashiksha or aatankwaad se jujhate pakistan ke liye kuch kar paane main asamarth dikhte hai
 In such a situation, he is giving such speeches to divert public attention

 But compared to the traditional Ghoomar, his dance seems a little weak

 Dance of tribals became tradition of Rajwadas, in Padmavati, Deepika did Ghoomar's grandeur in front of 'ghoomar' set, Dabisanjaya Leela Bhansali has not been able to stop the signature style from being included in the song
 bhavy set or becoground ke liye mashhoor sanjay ne gane main bhi is factor ko shaamil kiya he
 Due to the focus on the set and the background, the ghoomar dance seems to be suppressed somewhere

 Talking about the song, Padmavati's Ghoomar song sung in the voice of Shreya Khoshal and Swaroop Khan can be called Entertaining
 is gane ko lekar soshal media par bhi mix rivyus mil rahe hai
 Some people are very appreciative of this song of the film, while some are also very disappointed with this song
 ek yujar gane ko lekar likhaa he, rajasthani hone ke naate niraashaa hui, mujhe is gane kaa badi besabri se intjaar tha lekin ab bura lag rahaa he
 Disappointed

 company ne lagaataar paanchaven din udaanon ko radd karnaa jari rakhaa or iskaa share 19 fisad girakar ab tak ke nimnatam str par pahunch gaya lekin baad main isamen kuch sudhaar hua
 Sources said the severity of the crisis is evident from the fact that Kingfisher owner Vijay Mallya has appealed to Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee and Civil Aviation Minister Vayalar Ravi to help banks through lower interest rates
 iske alaava ve sabhi riyaayaten di jaaen jo air india ko mil rahi hai
 However, no official statement has been made as to whether there has been any initiative on Mallya's appeal this week
 shuukravaar ko company ne 40 se zyada udaanen radd kii or 50 payalat or chaalak dal ke sadsy beemaari ke naam par kaam par nahin aae
 Passengers took the services of other airlines by canceling a large number of Kingfisher tickets across the country
 haalanki iske liye unhen aakhri vakt par 20 se 40 fisad zyada keemat adaa kerani padi
 Kingfisher had earlier said the flights would be arranged after October 19 but now indicated that it would take a few more weeks for the flights to return to normalcy

 It was also asked whether the airline helped passengers who were inconvenienced by the cancellation of flights
