 After all, who is going to run this high profile Twitter handle? enditivi ne jab padtaal kii pataa chalaa ki da skin doctor naam se twitor handle chalaane vaala ye shaksh asal jivan main bhi skin doctor he
 Retired from the army is a doctor of skin
 troling kii ek khabar ke silsile main maine chah maheene pehle inase baat bhi thi
 The person who speaks English and Hindi has described his name as Vishcy Singh and said that he practices in Dehradun as a doctor of skin disease but when i spoke this time he said that i do not want to reveal my identity but now i am in Chandigarh
 jab maine unase poocha ki aakhir imran khan ko hamale kii jaankaree vaala twit kaise aapane kiya kya aapako koi jaankaree yaa sanket mili the
 So the skin doctor said that a week after the Pulwama attack, he used to make such a tweet to Imran Khan every evening
 da skin doctor libral patrakaron ko trol karte hai or bijepi ke paksh main kai saare twit ye lagbhag rojaanaa karte hai
 The skin doctor said during the conversation that how can i be aware of such a secret operation of this army
 jo log ye kayaas laga rahe hai wo hansi ke paatr he
 He said that every night many Twitter handles have made such tweets to Imran Khan
 isi tarah ke sinasen naam kaa twitor handle he jahaan kaha gaya ki ek taraf se iraan or amritsar se bharat pakistan par hamalaa karne vaala he
 Currently, Vishci Singh, who runs The Skin, does not want to reveal her identity
 isi tarah kaa ek twitor account da humar, jal kukdi, maithun bhaukaal jaise kai trol account se bhi da skin doctor ko retweet kiya gaya he
 These are all troll accounts where Twitter strikes on hypophile people of another country in the digital world

 So if you are also among those who go to the beach and play with sand, then be careful

 This has been revealed in a report by the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
 samachar agency sinhua ne sidisi kii patrika morbidity and morality vikali report main mangalvaar ko jari report ke hawaale se bataaya ki kishoriyon kaa maa bananaa chintaa kaa vishay he, kyonki kanoonee rup se ve vayask nahin hai
 Being a mother to adolescent girls in America is not a matter of morality, but it is a matter of concern for them that being a mother at a young age is not only dangerous from the health point of view, but it is also dangerous at the social, economic and medical level
 sidisi ke nideshak tom freeden ne ek bayaan main kaha, haalanki hamane kishoriyon ke maa banane ke aankadon main kami laane ke prayaas main mahatvapurn uplabdhi hasil kii he, lekin ab bhi kai sari ladkiyaan kishoravastha main hi maa ban rahi hai
 The report is based on data on teenagers' health behavior from the 1991 to 2012 National Vital Statistics System and the National Survey of Family Growth
 sidisi kii report ke mutabik, kishoron ke vyavhaar main abhibhavakon or paariwarik maahaul kaa khaasaa prabhaav padataa he
 The CDC said that the effects of adolescent motherhood occur in all areas
 schuli shiksha puri karnaa ho, college main namakan karana ho yaa rojgaar talashna
 Therefore, concrete steps need to be taken to reduce the number of teenage mothers

 The area remained the bastion of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) till the last assembly elections
 2007 ke vidhansabha chunaav main yahaan 21 vidhansabha siten thim or bispi ne inamen se 14 jiti thim
 The Samajwadi Party (SP) and Congress had got four and three seats respectively, while the account of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was also not opened
 parisemen ke baad 2012 vidhansabha chunaav main yahaan 19 siten bachiin
 In this election, the stronghold of the BSP was severely hit, but the dead elephant also stood at 1
25 million
 bispi ko sabase adhik 7, sapa ko 5, congress ko 4 or bijepi ko 3 siten milin
 In the subsequent two by-elections, the SP won the BJP seats and made its seats equal to the BSP and now the BJP has only one seat left
 sapa-congress ko vikaas kaa aasraisi badhat ko or pakkaa karne main jute hai do baar se jhaansi kii garautha vidhansabha seat se sapa ke vidhayak deep narayan singh urf deepak yadav

 donon ko pichley chunaav main mili vot jod len to baaki pratyaashiyon kii jamaanat jabt dikhti he
 Apart from this, farmer leader Shiv Narayan Parihar, who is preparing to contest from Congress ticket this time, is also working shoulder to shoulder with him
 lekin, bijepi ne yahaan se lodhi jati ke kisaan netaa jawahar rajput ko maidan main utaara he
 Like the entire state, the BJP is also trying to mobilize non-yadav backward castes like Kushwaha, Pal, Kurmi and Lodhi

 what does this mean? This means that many generations ago, we all had one father and grandfather
 parivaar main kisi ko ek kaam mil gaya, to kisi ko doosraa
 The BJP is trying to break this family of ours, while the socialists have always talked about joining
 " is saamaajik tanebane ke itar yadav ne india today se kaha, ''ham akhilesh ji ke vikaas kaaryon ke bal par chunaav jeetenge
 "actually Akhilesh Yadav has done extensive work in Bundelkhand

 Farmer Brahmadatta Pandey explained this math of the ticket at the bus stand of Atra town in Banda, in this fashion, "this election is between the parties with the base and the casteist parties
 " jab unase poocha ki iskaa matlab kya hua to pyaali main chaay phunkate hue unhone kaha, ''sapa or basapa ke paas janaadhar he
 The BJP has fielded its candidates on the basis of caste equation
 lekin bina janaadhar ke sameekaran chalegaa kaise?" haalanki jhaansi se bijepi pratyaashee or ilaake main bijepi ke iklaute vidhayak ravi kumaar sharma kaa kahana he, ''bundelkhand kii janata gundaraj or bhrashtachar ke khilaaf vot karne ja rahi he

 puraane basapai choudhary pichhlaa loksabhaa chunaav congress ke tikat par lade the, lekin is baar unki ghar vaapasi ho gai he
 His supporters hope that along with the traditional Dalit vote of the party, he will also get the vote of the urban voter

 With this, the party is aiming to tilt at least 50 percent Muslim voters

 The BSP is contesting the elections with the same strength and silence in the remaining seats of Bundelkhand
 vidhansabha or vidhaan parishad, donon main vipaksh ke netaa gayacharan dinakar or nasimuddin siddiki bundelkhand kshetra se hi aate hai
 In this Dalit-dominated stunt, the BSP has solid ground equations and if the BJP makes a dent in the sp-congress votes, the BSP will get a direct advantage

 Even if you have worked so hard, take votes, but tell me what will you do for us? "this question is justified because no matter how many schemes came from the Patha Drinking Water Project started in 1973 till date, villages like Tikra Mara have to walk for miles to get drinking water

 kya sunanda pushkar ne khudakushi kii yaa phir ek galati unki maut kii vajah ban gai? jis postmortem report se sunanda kii maut kii gutthi sulajhani thi, usee report ke saamne aane ke baad ye paheli or penchida ho gai he
 The post mortem report says that Sunanda died of a drug overdose
 yani sunanda ne ek saath zyada dawa kha lee or vahi dawa pet main jaakar jehar ban gai, lekin sawaal ye he ki dawa kaa overdoj sunanda ne jaanboojh kar liya yaa phir anjaane main?kya he sunanda pushkar kii postmortem report main
 
 
 The initial report of Sunanda's post-mortem has come out
 maut kii vajah bhi lagbhag saaf ho gai
 But the puzzle of death still holds its place
 ye sawaal abhi bhi apni jagah par he ki sunanda kii maut ko khudakushi kahenge yaa phir galati se hui maut?ames ke head medical board doctor sudhir gupta ne somvaar shaam ko vasant vihaar ke esadm alok sharma ko silband lipaphe main sunanda kii postmart report saunpi

 report main kaha gaya he ki overdoj kii vajah se dawa pet main jaakar jehar ban gai or usee kii vajah se sunanda kii maut ho gai
 The post-mortem report also mentions several injury marks on Sunanda's body, but according to the report these wounds have nothing to do with Sunanda's death
 sutron kaa kahana he ki postmortem report se ye saaf ho gaya he ki sunanda ne naa to jehar khaaya tha or naa hi unka katl kiya gaya he
 But the report did not mention whether Sunanda had taken the drug overdose intentionally or inadvertently? And these things have further complicated the puzzle of death
 darasal is maut ko kis khaane main rakhenge yaa is maut par kanoon kii koun si dharaaen lagaai jaaengi ye tabhi tay hoga jab ye saaf ho jayega ki sunanda ne kin halaat main drugs kii overdoj lee thi? khudakushi karne ke iraade se yaa phir anjaane main?kya he export kii raay
 
 
 By the way, if the experts believe, the drug-addicted patients usually know which medicine should be consumed and in what quantity
 sunanda padhi-likhi thim or chunki unka ilaaj bhi chal rahaa tha lihaaja wo dawa khaane kii aadi thim
 She knew very well what is the result of taking the medicine of depression together more than the prescribed quantity

 'sahitya ajtak' ke pathakon ke liye vahi anshaduniya main pehali niyamit hawaii dak seva saint pitsvarg se 1914 main shuru kii gai
 Then in 1918 the first regular air mail service was launched from New York to Washington
 phir chicago se 1923 main pehali niyamit raatri hawaii dak seva kaa aarambh hua
 At present, air mail services are making a splash all over the world, but in the case of air mail service, India has a unique account in its account
 vah yah ki duniya kii pehali sarkari hawaii dak seva elahabaad se naini ke bich 21 farvari 1911 ko chali
 Then for the first time in India a ship was flown for the postal service
 us samay elahabaad main kumbh chal rahaa tha
 At the same time a French pilot M
 picket ne ek nayaa itihaas rachaa
 He flew with 6500 letters from Allahabad to Naini in his aircraft heavyland aircraft
 is udaan ke baad duniya main sarkari dak dhone kaa ek nayaa daur shuru hua
 However, this flight was just 6 miles
 lekin is ghatana ko lekar elahabaad main utsav sa vaataavaran tha
 Not only this, all the big newspapers of that period featured prominently
 darasal us dauraan british evam colonian eiroplen company ne janvari 1911 main is vimaan ko janata ke pradarshan ke liye bheja tha, kyonki us dauraan duniya kaa sabase bada mela yani kumbh chal rahaa tha
 It was a period when people did not even see the ship in pictures
 haa uske bare main suna jarur tha
 In such a situation, it was also natural to have a huge crowd on this historic occasion
 yun to yah pehali dak yatra kul 27 minute kii thi phir bhi isane itihaas bana diya
 For the first time, the world's largest Prayag Kumbh was also seen from the sky
 is pehali hawaii dak seva kaa vishesh shulk 6 aana rakhaa gaya tha or isse honevaali aay ko oxford and cambridge hastal elahabaad ko daan main diya gaya
 a special arrangement was made for this service in advance
 18 farvari ko dopaher tak iske liye patron kii booking hui, jiske liye oxford cambridge hostel main aisi bheed lagi thi ki uski haalat mini jipio jaisi ho gai
 The postal department also deployed 3-4 personnel here
 chand roj main hostel main hawaii seva ke liye 3000 patr pahunch gaye
 One of these letters had a stamp of Rs 25
 vaise patr bhejne waalon main elahabaad kii kai nami giraami hastiyaan to thi hin, raja-maharaja or rajkumaar bhi the

 Regular air service in India started from 1920 to Mumbai between Karachi on a pilot basis with the help of Royal Airforce
 baad main isane sthai seva kaa aakaar le liya
 Later Via Rajkot ships started going to Kolkata
 vaise tab mumbai se karachi kii duuri 100 mile prati ghanta kii raftaar par 6 ghante main tay hoti thi
 The interesting fact is that the first proposal for the use of airplanes for commercial use was also made to the Government by the Director General of post-telegram
 aar
 Clarke gave in 1919
 isi ke tahat 5 march, 1920 ko air board bana tathaa chif inspector aaf air board kaa nayaa pad bana
 It took a long time for the speed of airline service in the world
 1918 tak hawaii jahaajon kii raftaar 130 mile thi jo 1935 tak 145 mile or 1947 main 300 mile prati ghanta par aayi
 The first authorized air stamp was released in 1917
 1932 main america main hawaii liphaafon kaa upyog shuru hua or 6 november 1917 ko hawaii seva se duniya kaa pehla akhbaar kep times bheja gaya, vahiin neuyark herald tribune bhi niyamit hawaii jahaaj se bheja jane laga
 In the context of India, it is more interesting that civilian aircraft first arrived in the international arena during 1929–30
 isi dauraan bharat se britain, france, holland or portugal ke liye hawaii sevaayen shuru huin
 In the same year scheduled air service in India came into existence and the postal of Europe started to reach Kolkata and Karachi by ship
 isi naate bharat sarkaar ko kolkata-karachi ke bich rajkeey vaayu seva shuru kerani padi, jise baari ghate ke kaaran 1931 main band kar diya gaya
 After this, this work was given to Imperial Airways, but this arrangement could continue till the end of 1931
 iske baad dak le jane kaa kaam dilli flying club ke hawaale hua
 He too surrendered until mid-1932
 phir bhi 1931 main bharat airmel postcard jari karanevaala pehla desh ban gaya
 The last of the 'sahitya Aaj Tak' dedicated to Ghazals at the Book Fair was madras-karachi air service in Sambabad from October 15, 1932, by Tata and Company Company via Ahmedabad, Mumbai and Bellary

 The first ship of the karachi-madras air mail service was the director J

 He brought with him two packets of postage, one for Mumbai and one for Madras
 is udaan kii gati karachi se ahmedabad ke bich 92 mile prati ghanta thi jabaki ahmedabad se mumbai ke bich 102 mile prati ghanta thi
 When the plane reached Mumbai, a huge crowd on Juhu greeted Tata
 lekin tata ne yah kehete hue afsos jataayaa ki ve 10 minute let hai, lihaaja badhai ke paatr nahin
 Actually in 1932, the main source of income of Tata Aircraft Company was air postal service
 iskaa kiraaya haada bhartiya dak taar vibhaag vahan karata tha
 The weekly air service between Karachi to Kolkata started in 1933 via Jodhpur, Delhi, Kanpur and Allahabad
 baad main tata ko bharat se europe aanejane vaali dak kaa bhi sara kaam mila
 In 1933, a new company named Indian National Airways became another which started the postal transportation work on the karachi-lahore route
 1935 main tata ne mumbai-trivendrum or 1937 main indore-bhopal-gwalior hokar dilli-mumbai kii seva bhi shuru kar di
 However, these services were then closed during the rainy days
 bharat main 1936 main teesri hawaii bhartiya company air services of india ne mumbai-kathiyawad ke bich vayuseva shuru kii lekin baari ghate ke kaaran company ko 3 saal main hi apana kaarobaar sametanaa padaa
 Tata and Indian National Airways remained in the fray
 1938 main bharat ke vimaanan kshetra main ek nayaa mode aayaa jabaki empire airmel kii shuruuaat hui
 Under this, the london-malaya air service started picking up postage from 2 airports in India, Karachi and Kolkata, 4 days a week
 is dak ke liye alag se kshetreey aadhaar par vyavastha bani
 Foreign mail also went by sea, but the new service became very popular
 us dauraan saare rashtramandal deshon main postcard bhejne kii dar aadha aana hi thi
 Later these companies were shocked by the plane accidents
 tata sans kaa ek jahaaj 10 janvari 1939 ko durghatnagrast ho gaya, jabaki lahore main indian neshnal airways kaa vimaan 25 farvari 1939 ko
 Then the air mail service was greatly affected between 1939–45, especially during the Second World War
 sari hawaii companiyaan ladaai main apni bhoomikaaon main jute gai thim
 The air mail service was running but in limited places
 donon bhartiya companiyaan royal airforce ke sahyog se kai margon par kaam kar rahi thim, lihaaja ladaai ne inaki mali haalat bahut sudhaar di
 This Tata company became known as Air India in July 1946
 aazaadee ke pehle tak bharat main 21 panjikrut vimaanan companiyaan thim, jinke paas 115 dakota vimaan the
 But there was a lot of conflict between the operators and the government regarding the air service
 deshi airmel seva ke tahat british oversij airways, air india li

 bharat paak vibhaajan ke purv bharat kaa hawaii dak terminal karachi main tha, jiske kaaran palam hawaii adde par nayaa terminal november 1947 main bananaa padaa
 Later India's first Minister of Communications, Rafi Ahmed Kidwai, started the All Up Scheme (complete air mail) scheme from Nagpur on January 30, 1949, on the anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi
 iske pehle tak hawaii jahaaj se keval vishisht shrenee kii dak hi jaati thi or us par bhi hawaii sarcharge alag se lagata tha
 But the air mail surcharge was removed on 1 April 1949 to benefit the general public
 lekin seva dhang se chale iske liye dak vibhaag ne postcard tathaa anya patron kii daron main maamuli ijapha kiya
 The common man was very relieved
 us dauraan dak main baari badhottaree ho rahi thi or sanchaalan mushkil hota ja rahaa tha
 In an investigation conducted by the postal telegraph department before starting this service, it was found that a quarter of the postcards and other letters in the country were found in Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Madras, Lucknow, Nagpur, Allahabad, Kanpur, Patna, Bhopal and Goes to Ahmedabad
 isamen se bhi 80 fisadi dak akele chaar pramukh mahanagaron main bheji jaati thi jo desh ke chaar alag-alag kone main sthit the
 Post-telegraph department used to have a lot of first class postage and airplanes were loaded with passenger service during the day
 aise main tay kiya gaya ki raat main seva shuru ho
 But in those days there was no facility to land the planes at night
 aise main vimaanapattanon par saare suraksha upayon ko pukhta kiya gaya
 This service itself effectively started night flights on the Indian sky
 iske pehle hawaii jahaaj din main hi udate the kyonki raat ke liye unke paas jaruri upkaran nahin the
 Mumbai, Kolkata, Madras and Delhi were connected to Nagpur by air mail service at Kidwai's initiative
 in nagaron se roj chaar jahaaj nagpur pahunch kar raat main thaharte or sabere apane ilaake kii dak ke saath waapas laut aate
 But the hurdles were also considerable and the air companies were demanding minimum profit guarantee and high wages from the government for this service, for which the government was not ready
 baad main lambii bahes ke baad indian oversij airline bina guarantee is seva ke liye raji huin or janvari 1949 main seva shuru kar di
 Postal and freight were the sources of its income
 company chaahati thi ki vah raat main sawari bhi le jaae lekin sarkaar ne yatri suraksha ke maddenjar is company ko isaki anumati nahin di
 Due to this effort, a large amount of postal Dhoni started, so it helped to improve the postal system
 baad main is seva se maniorder, bimaakrit patr, panjikrut akhbaar or parcel bhi hawaii sarcharge par bheje jane lage
 With this service, mail started arriving in all the distance areas the next day
 srinagar se somvaar ko bheja gaya patr trivendrum main mangalvaar ko dopaher baad mil janaa kisi chamatkaar se kam nahin tha
 This service proved to be nothing less than a boon for the common man, who used to wait long after sending postcards and other letters
 sari dak raat main bheji jaati thi, lihaaja din ke hawaii yatriyon ko bhi koi asuvidha nahin thi
 But Indian Overseas Airlines Ltd
 ne 19 may 1949 ko seva band kar di kyonki uski mali haalat bahut khasta ho gai thi
 By the end of June 1949, Deccan Airways and Indian National Airways started service between delhi-nagpur but had to stop service during the monsoon
 monsoon baad phir se sevaayen shuru hui to hawaii companiyon ne ruchi nahin dikhaai or ve kam se kam 3 rupye prati udaan prati mile kii guarantee chaahati thim, jabaki sarkaar is shart ke liye taiyaar na thi
 Himalayan Aviation came forward to provide the service without guarantee and started work from 15 October 1949
 lekin ise vimaan main maal or yatri le jane kii vishesh anumati bhi sarkaar ko deni padi
 By then the situation of night flights had improved, so passenger safety risk was not the first
 0raat main yatra ke liye vimaan haada us samay din ke bhaade se kam karke yatriyon ko rijhaane kii koshish hui
 The fare from Kolkata to Mumbai night service was Rs 172 while the day fare was Rs 205
 madras se dilli kaa raat kaa haada 191 rupye or din kaa 220 rou
 Was
 vimaan company ko raat main acchhee sankhya main savaariyaan bhi milane lageen or yah company may 1951 tak chalati rahi
 From 1 June 1951, Ducan Airways was granted a service license
 lekin usee dauraan sari vimaanan companiyon kaa rashtriyakaran ho gaya or 1 agast 1953 ke baad is seva kaa daayitv indian airlines ne bahut sakshmata se sambhala
 Taking advantage of this service, air parcels were started for the first time and from 1951 money orders also started coming from All Up Service
 yah bhartiya dak itihaas main ek nayi kranti thi
 However, the rate of plane accidents was quite high during that time
 * pustak anshah bhartiya dak sadiyon kaa safarnama, lekhak arvind kumaar singh Anna has suffered a big blow and the army chief has given this blow
 general wike singh ke team anna main shaamil hone kii ummid jataai ja rahi thi
 But the Army Chief has now shied away from this
 army chif ve ke singh ne saaf kah diya he ki abhi unhone ye tay nahin kiya he ki ritairement ke baad unhen kya karnaa he
 In Shimla on Tuesday, when General VK Singh was asked a question about joining Team Anna after retirement, his answer came that he has not taken any decision yet
 sena pramukh ne kaha, 'ritairement ke baad mujhe kya karnaa he is bare main maine ab tak koi faisla nahin kiya he
 'let me tell you that three days ago, Anna had invited the Army Chief to join his team after retirement
 team anna ko lagata he ki agar army chif bhrashtachar ke khilaaf jang main anna ke saath aate hai to andolan ko or majbootee milegi
 It is clear that this statement of the army chief is a big shock for Anna and his team

 One such name of up's politics is Atik Ahmed
 koun he atik ahmashtik ahamed kaa janm 10 agast 1962 ko hua tha
 Originally he hails from Shravasti district of Uttar Pradesh
 padhai likhaai main unki koi khaas ruchi nahin thi
 That is why he dropped out after failing in high school
 kai mafiaon kii tarah hi atik ahamed ne bhi jurm kii duniya se siyasat kii duniya kaa rukh kiya tha
 He was named in several cases of government contracting, mining and extortion in Purvanchal and Allahabad
 17 saal kii umr main pehla mukademaajawaani kii dahalij par kadam rakhte hi atik ahamed ke khilaaf pehla maamla darj hua tha
 And that case was of murder
 baat 1979 kii he jab 17 saal kii umr main atik ahamed par katl kaa iljaam laga tha
 After that Atik did not look back
 saal dar saal unke jurm kii kitaab ke panne bharte ja rahe the
 44 cases are registered against Atik In 1992, Allahabad Police issued a raw letter of Atik Ahmed
 jisamen bataaya gaya tha ki atik ahamed ke khilaaf uttar pradesh ke lakhanu, kaushambi, chitrakoot, elahabaad hi nahin balki bihar rajya main bhi hatya, apharan, jabaran vasuuli aadi ke maamle darj hai
 The maximum number of cases against Atik were registered in Allahabad district
 uplabdh aakadon ke anusaar varsh 1986 se 2007 tak hi uske khilaaf ek darjan se zyada maamle keval gangster act ke tahat darj kiye gaye
 The first step in politics Atiq Ahmed, who has earned a name in the world of crime, had understood how important the power of power is
 iske baad atik ne raajnneeti kaa rukh kar liya
 In 1989, Atik Ahmed, who first became an MLA from Allahabad (western) Assembly seat, contested the 1991 and 1993 elections as an independent candidate and also became an MLA
 1996 main isi seat par atik kosmajawaadee party tikat diya or vah phir se vidhayak chune gaye
 Atikatik Ahmed, who kept changing the party, joined his party in 1999
 vah pratapgarh se chunaav lade par haar gaye
 And in 2002, he again became an MLA from the same party
 2003 main jab upi main sapa sarkaar bani to atik ne phir se mulaayam singh kaa haath pakad liya
 In the 2004 Lok Sabha elections, Samajwadi Party gave Atik a ticket from Phulpur parliamentary constituency and became an MP
 uttar pradesh kii satta may, 2007 main mayawati ke haath aa gai
 Atiq Ahmad's spirits started to wane

 And Raju defeated Ashraf
 upachunaav main jeet darj kar pehali baar vidhayak bane raju paal kii kuch maheene baad 25 janvari, 2005 ko dindahaade goli markar hatya kar di gai thi
 MP Atiq Ahmed and his brother Ashraf were directly accused in this murder case
 sapa ne dabaav main party se nikalabaspa vidhayak raju paal kii hatya main namjad aaropee hone ke baad bhi atik saansad bane rahe
 Mulayam Singh expelled Bahubali MP Atiq Ahmad from the party in December 2007 after being the victim of all-round criticism due to this
 atik ahamed ne raju paal hatyakand ke gavaahon ko daraane dhamaake kii koshish kii
 But he could not succeed due to Mulayam Singh leaving from power and Mayawati coming to the chair
 inami saansad ban gaye the atikagiraftaar ke dar se bahubali saansad atik faraar the
 The property of five places including his house, office were attached on the order of the court

 Circulars were issued for the arrest of MP Atiq
 lekin mayawati ke dar se atik ahamed ne dilli main samarpan karnaa behatar samajha
 The countdown to Atiq Ahmed started after Mayawati came to power in several cases in the BSP government
 police or vikaas praadhikaran ke adhikariyon ne atik ahamed kii ek khaas pariyojna alina city ko avaidh ghoshit karte hue uskaa nirmaan dhwast kar diya tha
 On July 5, 2007, as a part of Operation Atiq, Umesh Pal, witness in the Raju Pal murder case, had filed a case against Atiq for abduction and forcible deposition at Ghumanganj police station
 iske baad chaar anya gavaahon kii ore se bhi unke khilaaf maamle darj karaaye gayi the
 Within two months, one case was filed against Atik Ahmed in Allahabad, 9 each in Kaushambi and Chitrakoot
 dilli main kiya tha aatmasarmapansapa saansad atik ahamed giraftaar kaa warrant jari hone ke baad se hi faraar chal rahe the
 The reward was also declared on his head
 isi dauraan atik ne khud ko dilli main police ke hawaale kii karne kii yojana banaai
 6 months after the issuance of warrant and reward, the Delhi Police showed his arrest from Pitampura's apartment
 us vakt atik ne kaha tha ki unhen upi kii mukhyamantri mayawati se jaan kaa khatra he
 Atikasal is out on bail
 When the Samajwadi Party government came in 2013, Atiq once again rode a bicycle
 philhal vah jamaanat par baahar hai
 And working for the party in the area
 philhal unke paas party main koi pad nahin he
 His younger brother Ashraf is also out on bail and doing his business

 Now the question is arising that how much strength and status has been given to a lobbying firm in the letter being sent to these mps that they will mix them with the Prime Minister and take them to Kashmir? Not only this, the question is also arising that whose money is behind this entire frills? But what is the result of this whole exercise? The first thing is that the Indian government has created a scope for internationalization of the matter on its part
 jab aap bahari saansadon ko aise maahaul main bulaate hai to phir unako hi nahin, dusron ko bhi tippanee karne kaa haq mil jaataa he
 Then it is not necessary that all these mps speak almost the same language that you want
 inamen se ek saansad ne baaqayada yah kah bhi diya ki agar bharat or pakistan chahen to europea sangh madhyasthata kar saktaa he
 The second result is further depressing
 sarkaar ke sabase ahm mantralayon ko qareeb se dekhne vaale samvaadadaata is baat kii pushti kar rahe hai ki is puri qavaayad se videsh mantralay anjaan yaa dur khadaa he
 All these decisions are being made at the level of the Prime Minister's Office
 yah baat bhi hairaan karti he ki europe se aae in saansadon ko pradhanmantri ke alaava rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar se milaayaa gaya, videsh mantri se nahin
 So is PMO sidelining the Ministry of External Affairs even in foreign affairs? If it is - which is seen in many other cases also, it is dangerous in many respects
 pichley kuch varshon ke saare chadhaav-utaar ke baavjood bhartiya videsh niti jin logon ke haathon main rahi he, unhen antarrashtriya kootneeti kii kahin zyaada samaj rahi he or uski jatiltaaon se nibatane kaa kahin zyaada behatar anubhav
 Here, there was no attempt to take advantage of this experience, as a result of which this exercise turned into a ridiculous game
 yah bhartiya loktantr ke us sansadeey dhaanche kii bhi avhelnaa he jisamen karypalika ko mantrimandal ke taur par kaam karnaa he jiske pramukh pradhanmantri honge
 Right now it seems that all the powers have been confined only in the Prime Minister's Office and the rest of the Ministry - even the Ministry of External Affairs - has been made redundant
 yaad kar sakate hai ki rafaal saude ko lekar saamne aae kuch dastavejon main raksha mantralay kii yah shikaayat dikhi thi ki piemo saude ko lekar samamaatar baatcheet kar rahaa he or iskaa asar moltol kii bhartiya kshamta par pad rahaa he
 Return to Kashmir
 agar ham use apana abhinn hissaa maanate hai to ise sabit bhi karnaa hoga
 That wall must be demolished which prevents the rest of India in Kashmir - its political representatives from coming and going
 aap na kashmiriyon par bharosa karen or na hi duusare logon par- or iske baavjood kehete rahen ki kashmir apana he to yah bhavuk daleel nahin chalegi
 But this is not a matter of argument, it is a matter of the country - let Kashmir breathe in the open air, let it talk to the rest of the world, let it do a little politics, let it speak in anger, then it will be normal and close to us
 
 varanaa aise halaat jitne lambey khinchenge kashmir utana hi peeche khisakta jayega
 The ridiculous trips of European mps will make government efforts unbelievable
 bharat ne pakistan kii ore se kii ja rahi golabari par kadi aapatti jataai he

 duniya ke kisi bhi loktantr ke liye zaruri he ki uskaa naagarik apane adhikaron, kartavyon ko samajhe or iske liye behad zaruri he ki wo sahi soochnaaon se las ho
 False, poorly or half-baked information can be fatal to civil democracy

 Some people also carry newspapers in the toilet and some keep watching news sites on mobile phones standing in the train

 Every institution makes its claim on the basis that it shows the most correct and fair news

 Whether it is in the news or not, it can be a matter of controversy
 aap khabar padhate vakt is baat ko mahatv dete hai ki peshewar paimaanon kaa paalan kiya gaya hoga
 So now, from Twitter to the tractor, the lifestyle of the journalists is being discussed
 isliye aap jaananaa chaahate hai ki media kitna swatantra he
 Many people also tell us that you speak openly
 aap sochiyegaa ki kyon kisi patrkaar se kehete hai ki aap khulkar bolte hai
 Would you like me to say that Ravish ji you do very well, you speak fearfully

 sarkaar ne khabaron par nigaraanee ke liye ek cameti bhi banaai he jo rose subah 9 se 11 ke bich shikaayat karne laayak maamle ko chunegi or pramukh sachiv ko bhejegi
 Chief Minister Kejriwal had told the court in his case that these provisions of defamation are against freedom of expression
 magar shaayad unke dimag main do prakaar kii azaadi he ek kejariwal azaadi doosraa manahani vaali azaadi
 Kejriwal himself is accused of taking press clippings without any evidence and never giving any evidence
 manahani or kanoon ke chakkaron se har reporter darataa he or daregaa
 Defamation of defamation will continue
 vaise hamaare desh main kai baar udyogpati aise saadhaaran se notice bhejkar reporter ko daraa dete hai
 Now the government will do the same
 aapmen se kai log hamase sampark karte hai ki phalane vibhaag main ghapala chal rahaa he yaa adhikari laaparvaah he isaki khabar likhiye taaki sarkaar karrvai kare
 You citizens do the right thing
 lekin jab sarkaar apane adhikari se kahe ki kuch aapattijanak lage to hamako bataao ham reporter par hi manahani karenge to hamaare saath aap bhi mukademe main lapet liye jaaenge
 So it can be against the circular press as well as against you
 duniya main koi aisi khabar nahin hoti jo shat pratishat satya ho
 Rather, the news is closer to the fact than to the truth
 kai baar bilkul kareeb hoti he to kai baar dur hokar bhi sahi nishane par hoti he
 On the basis of all such news, governments have fallen and democracy has survived
 jis tarah se media har daur main acha yaa bura rahaa he usee tarah se har daur main sarkaron ne media ko saadhane kaa prayaas kiya he or media ne har daur main apni jagah banaai he
 i am announcing the comments of one such media round
 
 
 'koi kitna bhi chillaata rahe akhbaar vaale sudharte nahin hai
 This is the sinful way of newspaper people to earn money by increasing the sales of newspaper by provoking people in this way
 aisi juthi baton se panna bharne kii apeksha akhbaar band ho jaaen yaa sampadak aise kaam karne ke bajaay pet bharne kaa koi or dhandha khoj len to acha he
 'modi, who called the media a marketer in 2015, or Kejriwal, who threatened the media with defamation, but Mahatma Gandhi has said this
 12 farvari 1947
 Cited the example of the era when the Indian press was taking on the British
 ek udhaaharan se khush hone kii zarurat nahin he
 i am quoting Gandhi because the leader of the government which has taken out a surveillance circular for defamation, had also caught a part time Gandhi Part Two and called his fight another fight for independence
 tippaniyan At the time of the first freedom struggle, when the Bombay Chronicle newspaper had to pay a heavy fine in the case of defamation, Gandhi wrote in Young India on 7 August 1924, 'press activity has replaced the new activity called treason and defamation
 
 akhbaar kaa sampadak likhte samay sone ke taraazoo par apane shabdon ko nahin tolta he
 Might make a mistake in haste
 manahani ke ye mukademe bhartiya patrakarita kaa manobal todane ke liye hai taaki jan aalochana satark or dabbu kism kii ho jaae
 i do not like irresponsible or unfair criticism, but the habit of being cautious should come from within
 baahar se thopa nahin janaa chahie
 ' mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal media ke public trial kii baat karte hai jahaan bheed faisla karegi
 Then the decision between the circular and these two that the representative of the government or party will not go in the TV debate
 aap acha kaam kar sakate hai to kya kisi achche vyakti ko yah adhikaar de diya jaae ki wo dusron ko acha kaam na karne de
 If the journalist is shown fear of law then how will he do a good job of taking the risk and exposing some news
 ye basic kochchan he baaki to jo he so haiye he or wo paanch saal tak to haiye hi haiye he
 This is the extortion of defamation or creating fear of accountability to the media
 media kii kamiyon kii safai koun karegaa

 2013 main hamaari sansad kii standing cameti ne ped news ke sandarbh main report di he or 2011 main britain main levesan kii report ne bhi kai mahatvapurn upaay sujhaaye hai
 i often take such pictures when you are reading newspapers with a blind eye
 kya tab bhi aap in akhabaaron ko chaav se padhate ye sirf sarkari press relise se bhari hotin? mujhe nahin lagata ki aap itane boring pathak yaa darshak hai
 You must want to read different claims or opinions similar to government claims
 naukarshahi belgaum he lekin chunaav jeetne ke baad koi netaa apni naukarshahi ko yah rasta bataaye ki media par kaise lagaam lagaani he to sochiye ki iskaa asar kya hoga
 However, India ranks 136th out of 180 countries in the world in terms of media freedom
 pehle se hi kam he
 The Chief Minister of Delhi has issued a circular to the officials that if they feel that any news is not correct or objectionable, they can ask the Principal Secretary to file a criminal defamation case
 aarope sabit hua to sampadak, reporter ko do saal kii jail ho sakati he
 The government has also constituted a committee to monitor the news which will pick up a complaint and send it to the principal secretary between 9 to 11 in the morning
 mukhyamantri kejariwal ne apane maamle main adaalat se kaha tha ki ye jo manahani ke praavdhaan hai abhivyakti kii azaadi ke kilaaf hai
 But perhaps there are two types of freedom in his mind, one is Kejriwal freedom and the other is defamatory freedom
 khud kejariwal par aarope he ki bina kisi saboot ke press cliping lekar aarope laga dete hai or kabhi saboot nahin dete hai
 Every reporter is scared and intimidated by defamation and rounds of law
 manahani kaa laabehani hi karata rah jayega
 By the way, many times in our country, industrialists intimidate reporters by sending such simple notices
 ab sarkaar bhi vahi karegi
 Many of you contact us that there is a scandal in the so-called department or if the officer is careless, write the news so that the government can take action
 aap naagarik ekadam sahi kaam karte hai
 But when the government tells its officer that if something seems objectionable, tell us, we will defame the reporter only, then you will also be caught in the case with us
 lihaaza yah circular press ke saath-saath aapke khilaaf bhi ho saktaa he
 There is no news in the world which is 100 percent true
 balki khabaren satya ke nahin tathy ke kareeb hoti hai
 Sometimes it is close, and sometimes even after being away, it is on the right target
 aisi tamaam khabaron ke aadhaar par sarkarein giri hai or loktantr bachaa he
 The way the media has been good or bad in every round, in the same way, in every round, the governments have tried to help the media and the media has made its way in every round
 media ke ek aise hi daur kii tippanee suna rahaa hum
 
 
 'no matter how much someone shouts, newspapers do not improve
 logon ko bhadakaakar is prakaar akhbaar kii bikri badhaakar kamai karnaa, yah paapi tarika akhbaar waalon kaa he
 It is better to stop the newspapers than to fill the page with such false things, or if the editor finds some other business to fill the stomach instead of doing such work
 ' 2015 main media ko bazaaru kehane vaale modi yaa media ko manahani se daraane vaale kejariwal ne nahin, balki mahatma gandhi ne ye baat kahi he
 12 February 1947
 us daur kaa udhaaharan diya jab bhartiya press angrejon se loha le rahaa tha
 There is no need to be happy with an example
 gandhi ko kot isliye kar rahaa hum ki jis sarkaar ne manahani ke liye nigaraanee kaa circular nikaala he uske netaa bhi ek part time gandhi part tu pakad laae the or apni ladaai ko azaadi kii duusari ladaai bataate the
 The comments pehali azaadi kii ladaai ke time main jab bombai chronical akhbaar ko manahani ke cese main baari jurmaana dena padaa to gandhi ne 7 agast 1924 ko yang india me likhaa, 'press lau kii jagah rashtradroh or manahani ke naam kii nai gatividhi ne jagah le lee he
 While writing a newspaper editor does not break his words on the gold scales
 jaldbaazi main galati kar saktaa he
 These defamation cases are meant to break the morale of Indian journalism so that public criticism becomes cautious and submissive

 Should not be imposed from outside
 ' Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal talks about a public trial of the media where the crowd will decide

 If you can do good work then should any good person be given the right to not let others do good work

 This is the basic kochhan, the rest is what has been done and it has been for five years
 ye manahani kii rangadari he yaa media ko javabdehi kaa khoff paidaa karnaa
 Who will clean the media's shortcomings
 mukhyamantri yaa koi sanstha
 In 2013 the Standing Committee of our Parliament reported in terms of paid news and in 2011 the Leveson report in Britain also suggested several important measures
 dilli ke mukhyamantri ne adhikarikon ko ek circular jari kiya he ki agar unhen lage ki koi khabar sahi nahin he yaa aapattijanak he to pramukh sachiv se kahkar aapraadhik manahani kaa maamla darj karvaa sakate hai
 If the charge is proved, the editor, the reporter may face up to two years in prison
 sarkaar ne khabaron par nigaraanee ke liye ek cameti bhi banaai he jo rose subah 9 se 11 ke bich shikaayat karne laayak maamle ko chunegi or pramukh sachiv ko bhejegi
 Chief Minister Kejriwal had told the court in his case that these provisions of defamation are against freedom of expression
 magar shaayad unke dimag main do prakaar kii azaadi he ek kejariwal azaadi doosraa manahani vaali azaadi
 Kejriwal himself is accused of taking press clippings without any evidence and never giving any evidence
 manahani or kanoon ke chakkaron se har reporter darataa he or daregaa
 Defamation of defamation will continue
 vaise hamaare desh main kai baar udyogpati aise saadhaaran se notice bhejkar reporter ko daraa dete hai
 Now the government will do the same
 aapmen se kai log hamase sampark karte hai ki phalane vibhaag main ghapala chal rahaa he yaa adhikari laaparvaah he isaki khabar likhiye taaki sarkaar karrvai kare
 You citizens do the right thing
 lekin jab sarkaar apane adhikari se kahe ki kuch aapattijanak lage to hamako bataao ham reporter par hi manahani karenge to hamaare saath aap bhi mukademe main lapet liye jaaenge
 So it can be against the circular press as well as against you
 duniya main koi aisi khabar nahin hoti jo shat pratishat satya ho
 Rather, the news is closer to the fact than to the truth

 12:03 AM vitt mantri arun jetali mangalvaar ko sanbhaalenge raksha mantralay karyaprabhar "" Hrithik used to fly his kite in the sky of Bollywood, but 3 powerful people of Bollywood cut Hritik's kite before flying
 bollywood ke teen super khan ne milakar rithik roshan kaa sukun chin liya
 The postponed 'kites' relievers are looking for an opportunity to fly their kites in the open sky, but Khan is busy trying to show his strength
 bollywood main khabar ye he ki rithik kii film 'kits' kii relies teesri baar bhi tal gai he
 The film is no longer releasing on February 15, 2010, as the Badshah of Bollywood staked its claim on February
 shahrukh kii film bani baadhashahrukh khan kii film 'maai nem khan' relies ho rahi he
 It is said that Hrithik's father Rakesh did not want to mess with Bollywood's Don K, so he realized his goodness in taking the release of 'kites' further
 pehle aamir ne maaraa maidanakete hai ki isse pehle rithik kii film ko disambar ke maheene main relies karne kii yojana thi
 Hrithik's love story with Mexican beauty Barbara could easily have taken off on Christmas, but Aamir Khan hit the ground
 unki film 'thri idiyats' 25 disambar ko relies ho rahi he
 So the prince of cinema fell victim to Mr
 Perfectionist's perfection
 salmaan se chalaa silsilaaritik kii 'kits' ko kaatane kaa ye silsilaa shuru kiya tha salmaan ne
 Hrithik's film 'kites' was all set to release on the occasion of Diwali
 16 oktober, 2009 taarikh bhi mukarrar thi, lekin salmaan to salmaan hai
 When they come on their own, they do not even listen to themselves
 is tarah 3 baar teen khan ke door se cat chuki he rithik kii patang
 Now it is a coincidence or Khan's awe, know only Hrithik, but currently the release date of 'kites' is not fixed
 kising seen par bhi kanchisirf rithik kii patang hi nahin kati, balki rithik ke kis par bhi chal gai kanchi, lekin kis ko bachaane ke liye rithik haath-pair maar rahe hai
 Even if KISS survived, there is no use, because millions of Hrithik's fans will not be able to see his film
 'e' certificate milane kii charchasensor board ko aapatti he barbara or rithik ke sabase shandaar 'kis' seen par
 The sensor is unable to stop itself from moving the scissors
 itnaa jabardast he wo seen
 Not only this, due to the overwhelming kissing scene, the censor board has made up its mind to give the film an 'A' certificate
 agar rithik kii film kits ko 'e' certificate mil gaya, to jaahir he ki 18 saal se kam umr ke unke fain rithik ke naye avatar ko dekhne se vanchit rah jaaenge
 If there is no dream, now if the film has to be saved from the 'A' certificate of the censor, then which scene will have to be removed from the film
 aisa hua to parade par kis kaa nayaa kirtiman banane kaa rithik kaa sapana adhuraa hi jayega
 Hrithik's dream of achieving the title of the hottest hero on screen will remain the dream
 samjhauta hi ekmaatr rastaritik kii film 'kits' sirf barbara se kis ke chalate surkhiyon main nahin hai
 The film has such action and thrills, which till now people have seen only in Hollywood films
 kehete hai car accident kaa ek seen to itnaa khatarnaak tha ki rithik apana ghutana tak tudwa baithe
 Now Hrithik has no choice but to compromise
 agar kis ko parade tak lekar janaa he to 'e' certificate hasil karnaa hi hoga
 If the fans under the age of 18 have to take their risky action, then which scene will have to be removed from the film
 dekhte he rithik or unke papa koun sa rasta nikaalte hai

 com / 24ty7peqzy— Mushfiqur Fan (@naagindance)march 12, 2019khaas baat yah rahi ki indore ke holkar stadium main 24 saal ke nikhil ne maharashtra kii pari ke aakhri over main 5 chakke jadne kaa karnama kiya
 This time, Nikhil, who was waiting for a chance in the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) team in the IPL, made an over in the medium pacer Amit Mishra of the Railways
 vah chauthi gend par chook gaye, varanaa ek over kii sabhi gendon par chakke lagane main kaamyaab ho jate
 Nikhil Nayak of Maharashtra has been bought by KKR at the IPL-2019 auction for his base price of Rs 20 lakhs
 aisa nahin ki vah pehali baar ipel main utrenge
 He has previously played for Kings XI Punjab in 2016, although he was not effective then and managed to score 23 runs in two matches
 supreme court ne mangalvaar ko kaha ki vah congress-jad (es) ke ayogy ghoshit kiye gayi 17 vidhayakon ke maamle main mukhyamantri bi es yediurppa ke audio clip par vichaar karegaa jo kathith rup se is vidhayakon ke sandarbh main he
 a three-member bench of Justice NV Ramana, Justice Sanjiv Khanna and Justice Krishna Murari said that since the matter has been brought to its notice, the apex court will consider it
 haalanki, peeth ne yah spasht nahin kiya ki kya vah is audio clip ko ricard main shaamil karegi
 The apex court said that the issue raised at this time was also raised before it during the hearing of the petitions of these mlas challenging the decision of the Speaker
 bies yediurppa kaa yah kathith audio clip haal hi me hubli main party kii ek baithak kaa he jisame vah paanch disambar ko hone vaale upachunaav ke liye ayogy ghoshit kiye gayi in vidhayakon ko tikat dene kaa virodh kar rahe apane netaaon ke prati aprasannataa vyakt kar rahe hai
 This audio clip has surfaced only on Friday
 is audio main vah kathith rup se kah rahe hai ki kagress-jad (es) ke baagi vidhayaakon, jinhen baad main adhyaksh ne ayogy qaraar de diya, ko karnataka kii gathbandhan sarkaar ke antim dinon main bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah kii dekharekh main mumbai main rakhaa gaya tha
 On behalf of the Karnataka Congress, senior advocate Kapil Sibal told the bench that in the audio clip of bjp's core committee meeting in the audio clip, Yeddyurappa has said that the entire strategy was devised by BJP national president, Amit Shah, who is also home minister
 kapil sibbal ne kaha ki in baagi vidhayakon kii yachikaaon par nyaayalay 25 oktober ko sunwaayee puri kar chukaa he, isliye vah is audio clip ko ricard ke liye pesh karnaa chaahate hai
 The bench told Sibal that during the debate you have covered all the aspects in detail
 is par sibbal ne kaha ki yah audio clip sheersh adaalat me bahes puri hone ke baad saamne aayaa he
 The bench told Sibal that during the debate you had mentioned his guest Nawaji, allegedly by BJP in Mumbai to these mlas
 ayogy ghoshit kiye gayi 17 main se 15 vidhayakon kii siton par paanch disambar ko upachunaav hoga
 The congress-jd (S) coalition government led by Kumaraswamy fell due to the resignation of these mlas and the absence of the House during the trust vote and the BJP government led by Yeddyurappa came to power
 in 15 nirvachan kshetron main party ke sthaneey netaaon ke virodh ke bich yediurppa ne haal hi main yah aashwaasan diya tha ki ayogy ghoshit kiye gayi vidhayakon ko tikat diye jaayenge, yadi ve bhaajapa ke tikat par chunaav ladanaa chahenge
 Yeddyurappa had termed the victory or defeat of the BJP in the elections as a separate matter, saying that only the disqualified mlas gave the party an opportunity to come to power
 pune kaa ek aspataal aisa bhi he jahaan sabhi kanya ke janm kii khushiyaan manaate hai
 Whenever a girl child is born in this hospital, the hospital staff celebrate it and congratulate each other
 pune ke hadapsar ilaake main sthit medicare hospital ke karmchaaree ladki ke janm kii khushi main sadakon par thaliyaan petakar elaan karte hai or logon main pede baantate hai
 Under this revolutionary initiative started by the hospital's founder and Malik Ganesh Ash, Medicare Hospital does not even charge the hospital for the birth of a girl child
 raakh ne bataaya, 'hamane 2007 main yah pahal kii thi ki kanya shishu ko janm dene vaali mahilaon ke liye aspataal kaa shulk maaf kar diya jaae
 Then whether the baby is born in a normal way or by operation
 bachche ke janm ke baad maa ko di jane vaali chikitsakeey suvidha bhi muft uplabdh karai jaati he
 Since then, 270 female babies have been born here
 'raakh apni is pahal ko bharat main kanya bhrun hatya rokane or langik purvagrahon ko khatm karne ke liye chalaaya gaya ekal abhiyaan bataate hai
 He said that despite suffering losses, the hospital provides free facilities on the birth of a girl child
 unhone kaha, 'vastav main kai parivaar shulk bharne kaa prastaav bhi dete hai
 But we ask them to help the poor women with these money, so that the women who are working and working in the homes of others can also take maternity leave for at least three months
 'ek majdoor pita adinath or dusron ke gharon main kaam karne vaali maa sindu kii santan raakh kehete hai ki chaatravrutti kii sahaayta se padhai puri karne ke baad jab unhone doston or rishtedaaron se karj lekar aspataal kholaa, to shuruyaat main koi unke vichaar se sahamat nahin tha
 But later his fellow practitioners also appreciated his initiative further
 raakh ne aage kaha, 'ab samaaj se mili yogadan ko chuktaa karne kii baari he
 Initially, no one supported me
 phir varisht stri rog visheshgy ikabal shaikh ne kanya shishu janm kii jimmedaari apane haathon main le lee
 Then child surgeons Anil Chavan and Santosh Shinde also joined the initiative
 'jald aspataal ke sabhi karmchaaree raakh kii is pahal main yogadan dene ke liye aage aae, tathaa kai baar der se vetan milane ke baavjood ve isaki shikaayat nahin karte, kyonki ve jaanate hai ki ve yah sab samaaj hit main kar rahe hai

 main barahavin kaksha kaa vidhyaarthee hoon or meri board kii parikshaon main keval do maheene shesh hai
 Since the twelfth grade is the last class of the school, today the school has organized a farewell ceremony for the students of the twelfth standard
 yah keval ek pratha he; har koi vidaa nahin ho jaataa; bahut se vidhyaarthee baras-dar-baras is samaaroh kii shobhaa badhaate hai
 However, as per custom, the students of class XI and the teachers of the school conduct this function for the students of class XII
 dopaher ke baarah baj rahe hai, dhoop tej par sahneeya he
 At the same time of prayer this morning, the principal had instructed the students of class XI and XII to assemble at twelve o'clock in the field
 sabhi chaatr is samay khule maidan main panktiyaan banaae baithe hai
 Some have torn the pages from the coppies and laid them down to protect the trousers from the soil
 maine aisa nahin kiya, kyonki chaahe jitna bachaao mere kapadon par to mitti lag hi jaati he
 i am proudly sitting in that row of class XII where there are only a few students
 yah barahavin kaksha main vigyaan padhane vaale chaatro kii pankti he
 The subject of science came into our school only two years ago and i am also in the first class to study science
 vigyaan ko mere skool main ek mahaan or kathin vishay mana jaataa he
 This is why we science students have an unwritten special status
 sabhi adhyapakgana hamaari ore bahut sneh or aashaa kii drushti se dekhte hai
 We are expected that we will brighten the name of the school by bringing good results in the board exams
 is tarah ke vidaai samarohon main adhikansh chaatro kii ruchi kaa vishay ek samosa, ek barfi, ek kelaa or ek santara hote hai jo samaaroh ke baad har chaatr ko lifaafe main daalkar die jate hai
 Due to the event, most students are not interested in its importance and teachers' speeches etc
 or ye lijie
 
 
 Speeches have started
 principal mahoday or barahavin kaksha ke class-teachers chaatro ko apni-apni aashaaon ke bare main bataa rahe hai
 Most students have nothing to do with these hopes
 ve ek-duusare se dabi awaz main baatcheet karne main mashgool hai
 After about twenty minutes the speeches finally ended and now some awards are being announced to encourage the students
 aise puraskaar ke rup main aksar pen, copy yaa jeometry box diya jaataa he
 
 
 
 mujhe aaj tak kabhi koi puraskaar nahin mila
 In the last twelve years, i could never score the highest marks in the class, i could not even participate in sports and for some unknown reason i was not even among the most beloved students of teachers
 manch par ek-ek karke puraskaar vijetaon ko bulaayaa ja rahaa he
 i hear every announcement with a throbbing heart that my name may also be called; But as pen-sets, copies and geometry boxes are distributed among the other students one by one from the on-stage table, my hopes are getting weaker, i sit in the 'elite' row of students studying science
 i am feeling, but a joy, for which i have been craving for many years, i feel once again slipping away from my hands, even though i was in school Area on space and i than the roughly other students in science and English in the last two years has improved performance
 
 
 lekin puraskaar? wo to mujhe kabhi miltaa hi nahin he!''
 
 
 And this year's award for best student goes to Lalit Kumar ", said the teacher who was announcing the awards on stage
 maine jo suna us par mujhe vishwaas to nahin ho rahaa, lekin jo suna wo maine spasht suna he
 The best student award is being given to me! When i looked at the stage, the teachers were pointing me to come forward
 main betahasha dhadkate apane dil ko thaamne kii koshish main juta hoon
 In the twelve years of school, i have never been on stage till today, but today when i am at the last stage of school, i have finally proved myself
 
 
 main kisi se kam nahin hoon
 i was trying to stand on my crutches immersed in these feelings
 
 
 ''abe
 
 
 It has received this reward because it is 'langra', i heard the voice of a classmate sitting behind me
 puraskaar milane kii khushi main dhadkta meraa dil jaise achaanak ruk gaya
 
 
 Suddenly i felt the same silence and emptiness around me which takes me into my fire when i hear such things
 mujhe lag rahaa tha jaise meraa dimag sunn ho gaya ho
 
 
 As if someone wiped out my entire existence in one stroke
 ''yahan sabake saamne aao lalit'', manch se ai adhyaaapak kii awaz ne mujhe achaanak aa dhamke us sannaate se nikaala or main apane cheekhte man ko baisakhiyon par dhote hue manch kii ore badhane laga
 The students greeted me with a simple applause
 iske kuch der baad chaatro ke bich samoson ke lifaafe baant die gaye
 The teacher also went to the principal's room for tea and breakfast and all the students took things out of their envelopes and started eating
 
 
 
 But i was surrounded by that silence again
 maidan ke ek kone main baitha main man-hi-man ro rahaa tha
 Today, after twelve years of hard work, i got the title of being the best, but in the eyes of society, the title, Lalit, who won the title and the thousands of obstacles that he had, had no meaning
 samaaj kii nazar se dekhen to jo baisakhiyon par chalata he, use puraskaar keval isliye miltaa he kyonki vah viklang he
 Even a handicapped person can touch any height - my society could not imagine such a thing
 mere kisi bhi sahpaathee kaa jivan utana kshtprad nahin tha jitna meraa tha
 
 
 None of my classmates had worked as hard as i had to finish school
 
 
 mere kisi bhi sahpaathee ko apana man nahin maarna padaa tha
 
 
 i did not have to break my body for studies - but then why did my classmate taunt me? While sitting in a lonely corner of the field, i decided that i would not answer that classmate with anger, but with my achievements
 adhyaaapak maan chuke the ki main sarvshereshth hoon
 
 
 Now i had to give such an answer to my classmate whom he could not deny
 board kii pariksha nikat thi, mujhe swayan ko siddh karnaa tha
 And i did exactly that
 
 
 board kii pariksha main apni kaksha main mujhe sarvaadhik ank hasil hue
 i proved that the award i received was not sympathetic to anyone
 yah choti-si ghatana kisi bhi viklang vyakti ke jivan kii kathinaaiyon or hamaare samaaj ke viklaangata ke prati drushtikon ko rekhaankit karti he
 The fight against disability and the attitude of society can only be won on the strength of tireless hard work and will
