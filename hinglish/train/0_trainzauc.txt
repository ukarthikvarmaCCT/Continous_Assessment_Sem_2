 People have to decide whether to think according to the arguments of the IT cell or to think according to their own
 abhi kaha ja rahaa he ki jamiya ke chaatro ko bahakaaya gaya he, chaatro kaa kaam padhanaa he, pradarshan karnaa nahin he
 Do you really believe that students are performing only on seduction and provocation? No one speaks when the adhoc teachers of Delhi University demonstrate about their studies
 desh bhar ke karodon noujvaan sarkari naukari kii pariksha or uniwarsity kii pariksha ko lekar bhi andolan karte hai, laathiyaan khate hai
 Nobody pays attention
 pichley hi dinon gujarat main 11 lakh chaatro ne ek pariksha di
 In the examination, there was a big demonstration in Gandhinagar about the news of rigging, which was run with sticks
 aaj pariksha radd ho gai
 Did whatsapp University and IT Cell support him? There has been a struggle for many days in the recruitment of 69000 teachers from UP, has anyone cared? Then why this lecture to Jamia and JNU students alone? whatsapp University has done this on the strength of its strength and its spread
 uskaa har kaha ham sahi maan lete hai
 In Jamia Millia, lathi charge was also done on Friday before Sunday's police brutality
 campus main ghuskar aansu gas ke gole chode gaye
 If outsiders were instigating on Sunday, the police did not think that the students could be harmed while firing tear gas shells inside the campus
 vah bheetar jaati he or librari tak gherti he
 Last night, the DCP itself admitted that there were no issues with the students
 aap in video ko dekhie
 Keep in mind that even these videos do not tell the whole story
 agar jamiya ke chaatro ne ravivaar ko sabhi se madad nahin maangi hoti to kisi ko pataa bhi nahin chalata ki un par aisi barbarta ho rahi he
 Vice Chancellor herself uses the word vandalism
 tees hazari court ke bheetar jab police kii disipi monica bharadwaj or javaanon par hamalaa hua tha tab kai saare video saamne aae
 It is obvious that the Delhi Police must have given it to the media, quoting sources
 abhi tak police kii taraf se aise video saamne nahin aae hai jisase pataa chale ki ravivaar ko jamiya ke chaatr hinsa kar rahe hai
 Did not anyone feel ashamed that the students of the university were thrown out like criminals? If this picture was of a bjp-ruled state, would the IT cell and the dock media welcome this picture? Should this happen in a democratic country? Do you like seeing this? Delhi Police has given any clarification on this? Or was it comfortably put aside this question? Is Jamia targeted for any particular reason? No need to explain the reason
 jaanane kii zarurat he ki jamiya bhi dilli uniwarsity kii tarah he jahaan sabhi mazahabon or ilaakon ke chaatr padhate hai
 Nearly 50 percent of the students are non-muslims here

 Obviously, you will know this much

 Be it a rubber bullet or a bullet
 teenon surakshit hai
 Parimal Kumar and Sukirti of NDTV not only discovered them but also talked
 kya vaais chancelar najma akhtar ko apane is chaatr ke paas nahin hona tha? police or visi ne yah baat kyon chhipaai ki jamiya ke chaatr ko bullate lagi he? ek chaatr he ejaz or ek tameen he
 Ejaz is a student of Jamia
 uski chaati main goli lagi he magar khatre se baahar he
 Tamin has a bullet in his leg which has now been discharged
 vah chaatr nahin he
 Police said that there was no firing, then where did the bullet come from
 yah saaf nahin ki rabar bullate lagi he yaa bullate lagi he yaa aansu gas ke chharre lage hai
 The one whom Sukirti spoke to has said that he was passing
 jamiya kaa chaatr nahin he
 Whom did Najma Akhtar send messages to stop the violence when there was police on campus? Who did you talk to? They are saying that the police did not take permission from them
 yani police se unki baat nahin hui hogi phir ravivaar ko visi kaise kah rahi thim ki police bahari logon ko daudaate hue campus main aa gai? aaj wo police kii karrwai ko barbar bataa rahi thim lekin kya raat main ghayal chaatro ko dekhne gayi? hiraasat main liye gaye chaatro se milane gayi?police ke anusaar 39 chaatro kii medical legal certificate bana he yani itane ghayal hue honge jinka ilaaj hua he

 Jamia's VC did not attempt to find out
 ganimat he ki jamiya ke chaatro ne khud pahal kii or ravivaar shaam ko trahimam sandesh bhejnaa shuru kar diya
 If the internet and phone were off before the violence, you cannot imagine what would have happened there on Sunday evening
 jawahar laal nehru vishvavidhyalay ke chaatr sangh or shikshakon ne itio chalane kaa aahvaan kiya
 Students and teachers of Delhi University also reached

 The news of Jamia was not even fully reported that pictures started coming from Aligarh
 jamiya kii ghatana kii khabar pahunchate hi aligarh uniwarsity main jamiya ke samarthan main chaatr baahar nikal kar naare lagane lage
 DGP OP Singh said that the Vice Chancellor of AMU had given permission to come to the campus in writing that if needed, he can use the appropriate force inside the campus
 kya bheetar ke halaat itane bighad gaye the? eemyu ke sar syed get ke ek taraf se chaatr roak rahe the duusari taraf se police dhakka de rahi thi
 This video came before the internet was shut down, otherwise you do not see that the police comes in this way with the permission of VC
 kuch tasviren aisi bhi ain jisamen police kaa jawan girls kalege kaa get phaand rahaa he
 The students allege that the police entered the hostel and killed it
 lathi charge hua
 Tear gas shells were released
 hostel khaali karne ke liye chaatro ko do dinon kaa samay diya gaya he

 AMU is closed until 5 January
 aap is video ko dekhakar kya kahenge, dekh to rahe hi honge ki police laathiyon se bike tod rahi he
 Later this broken bike becomes the character of police stories that someone known or unknown rioted
 kisi ko andaaza nahin tha ki jamiya kii khabar sunate hi desh kii pachison uniwarsity main chaatr or shikshak march karne lagenge
 Posters will stand with banners

 They came on the road at night

 At the Delhi University too, students have raised their voice in support of Jamia
 maths departmet ke paas jamiya ke samarthakon or abivipi ke bich jhadpen bhi hui hai
 Students of Darul Uloom Nadwatul Ulema of Lucknow also came out on Sunday night to protest in support of the police violence in Jamia
 inke ugr ho jane ke kaaran uniwarsity 5 janvari tak band kar di gai he
 Students of Mumbai's Tata Institute of Social Science came out overnight and started shouting slogans

 punjab uniwarsity chandigarh, central uniwarsity aaf kerala, central uniwarsity aaf pandicheri pune ke savitri bai phule uniwarsity main bhi jamiya main hui police barbarta ke khilaaf pradarshan hue hai
 Do you really think that so many students have come under the influence of a separatist? Is it so easy to call the protesting students' movement as jihadi and separatist? Listen to the statement of Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and this statement should be heard by the Prime Minister
 pitiai ke anusaar vitt mantri ne kaha he ki hamen un jihadi, maovadi or algaavvaadiyon se saavdhaan rahanaa chahie jo chaatro ke pradarsh ko hijank kar sakate hai
 Prime Minister Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah have appealed to the students to be patient
 kya donon ko nirmala sitaraman or rakesh sinha se apil nahin kerani chahie ki aisi baat na karen
 Rajya Sabha MP Rakesh Sinha tweeted after the Jamia incident that it is not 1947 India but 2019
 diarect ection nahin chalegaa
 The language of his tweet directly threatened not criticism
 ek rajyasabha ke saansad kii yah bhashaa honi chahie? kya pradhanmantri rakesh sinha ko kuch kah paaenge ki diarect ection se tulana kar aap us jamiya ke chaatro ko muslim ligi na bataaen jisaki buniyaad mahatma gandhi ne rakhi thi? olt news ne bijepi soshal media ke pramukh amit malviya ke twit kiye gaye video kii jaanch kii he
 The video was circulated by saying that AMU students are raising slogans against Hindus
 lekin jab olt news ne usee video kii behatar quality vaale clip ko khoja to pataa chalaa ki usamen chaatr hindutv kii kabr khudegi naare laga rahe hai
 Not against Hindus
 hindutv kaa sandarbh bijepi kii raajnneeti se he
 But can the Delhi Police take action against this attempt to make them provocative by telling Hindu religion? If she is searching for a rumored video, will she see this video? Students should also avoid violence
 yah unki bhi zimmedaari he
 Do not let the agitation of the demonstration reach the point that the possibility of violence starts to appear and restraint in the language of slogans has to be maintained
 upi ke mau main jo pradarshan hua he uske ugr hone kii khabar he
 This fierceness will turn the entire protest into a fad and then there will be no point in protesting
 narendra modi ne 2002 dangon ke dauraan vaajapeyi ke rajdharm di gai naseehat ke vivaad par pehali baar bolte hue kaha ki tatkaaleen pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi ne rajdharm ke maamle main unhen kabhi nahin disha-nirdesh die
 Narendra Modi said that whatever Vajpayee Ji had said is available on youtube
 koi bhi sun saktaa he
 He was nothing of the sort
 madhya pradesh ke gwalior main ek raily ko sambodhit karte hue narendra modi ne yah baat kahi
 He said that Vajpayee Ji had said that Rajdharma should be followed, which you are doing
 narendra ne yah baat pradhanmantri manmohan singh ke ek aarope ke baad kahi

 US President Donald Trump's policy on children and guardians has been seen to be weak, with Trump's wife and America's first lady Melania Trump criticizing him
 niti america seemaa par pravasi maataaon-pitaaon or unke bacchon ko alag hone ke vishay par he
 Laura Bush, wife of former Republican President George W
 Bush, has also called the move to separate children from their parents cruel and unethical, targeting the policy of the current US president
 saath hi unhone yah bhi kaha ki isse unka man hataash hota he
 If we talk about the statistics of the Home Security Department, between April 19 and May 31, about 2,000 children have separated from their parents and guardians, who have been kept in some special centers
 yahrashtrapatitrump kii jaraa bhi bardaasht nahin karne kii avrajan niti ke kaaran hua he
 The debate in the US intensified when pictures and stories of children facing separation from their parents came to light, which was due to Trump's disputed immigration policy
 bahut kam dekha jaataa he jabamelaniise tarah ke nitigat muddon par apni raay jaahir karti he
 This policy knocked him so much that through his spokesperson he said that he hated to see children separated from their families
 melania kii sanchaar nideshak stepheni grisham ne yah bhi kaha ki hamen aisa desh banane kii jarurat he jo saare kanoonon kaa paalan karata 
 But it is also to be a country where governance runs from the heart
 khud apravasi rah chuki grisham ne melania ke madhyam se kaha ki vah ummid karti hai ki safal avrajan sudhaar ke liye donon paksh saath aaenge
 Bush has written an article in Newingtonpost saying, 'I live in a border state
 main apni antarrashtriya simaaon kii raksha kii jarurat maanati hum, lekin yah jaraa bhi bardaasht nahin karne kii niti krur he
 It is immoral
 isse meraa dil tuutata he
 At the same time, he said, "our government should not be involved in the task of keeping children in box stores nor should they put tents in the desert outside El Paso
" ye tasviren dwitiya vishwa yuddh kii japani america najarbandi shiviron kii yaad dilaati hai, jise ab america itihaas main sabase sharmnaak ghatnaon main gina jaataa he
 Under the Trump administration policy, every adult found illegally crossing the border is charged with federal crime
 jabaki pehle agar kisi vayask ko uske bacchon ke saath seemaa paar karte giraftaar kiya jaataa tha to unhen avrajan adaalaton ke hawaale kar diya jaataa tha
 The CNN report said that since the government is accusing parents under the criminal justice system, children are being separated from them, there is no clear procedure that they can reunite
 koi aisi suvidha bhi nahin he jisamen mata-pita apane bacchon kaa pataa lagane ke liye kol kar saken
 The policy to prosecute all adults was announced on May 7, but the Department of Justice announced that it would prosecute 100 percent of the cases sent to her in early April
 raashtrapati trump ne is halaat ke liye baar - baar democratic party ko jimmedaar tehraaya he jabaki unke prashasan ne niti main badlaav kiya he
 bangalorekarnataka Janata Paksha president BS Yeddyurappa termed the Congress victory in the Assembly elections on May 5 as good for the state but said it would be interesting to see how the party ruled
 unhone samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘haa, congress kii jeet karnataka ke liye acchhee he
 It is honeymoon time for the party and it will have to be seen how they (leaders) rule in future
 ’lambey samay baad karnataka main congress kii satta main vaapasi ke liye unki party ko jimmedaar tehraane sambandhi sawaal par unhone kaha logon ne yah janadesh diya he or unki party isamen kuch nahin kar sakati
 Clearly denying his return to the BJP, Yeddyurappa said it was a significant achievement that his five-month-old party KJP secured a total of 10 per cent of the votes and six seats in the assembly elections

 'india today' ke sho 'tu da point' main captain amarinder singh ne kaha siddhu ko tivi main kaam karnaa jari rakhana chahie yaa nahin is par wo edwocket general kii raay maangenge

 siddhu ne kaha, 'raajnneeti ek taraf he or rojgaar ek taraf
 They have to give one night for this show, because the show suits the night

 ' dharmik swatantraaa par ek america ayog kii ek sheersh adhikari ne kaha he ki bharat ke sheersh netritv ko ugr bayaan ke khilaaf kahin adhik prakharata se bolnaa chahie
 India's refusal to issue visas to them as a member of an independent organization has been called a huge opportunity
 antarrashtriya dharmik swatantraaa par america ayog (yuassiaiaref) kii ayukta katrina laantos sweate ne kaha ki bharat ek sau pachchis karod kii aabaadi vaala duniya kaa sabase bada loktantric desh he
 They should now be somewhat defensive in allowing the commissioners and professionals of the American Commission to look into the protection of human rights, but in my view it shows weakness and not strength
 laantos sweate ne kaha, 'main ise kuch-kuch samaj se pare or bharat kii ore se ek shandaar avasar ganvaane ke rup main paati hum
 ' saal 2001 or 2009 ke baad yah teesraa mauka he, jab bharat yuassiaiaref ke sadasyon ko vija jari karne main naakaam rahaa he
 He said that India is a great society and is included in the most important countries of the world
 unhone kaha ki kisi ko bhi yah aashaa kerani chahie ki bharat jaisaa ek loktantric or bahultavaadi samaaj ayog kii yatra kaa swaagat karegaa
 The decision taken by the Government of India is defensible
 laantos sweate ne kaha ki kuch bhartiya rajyon main bahut hi jatil kanoon hai or dharmik alpsankhyakon ke prati sampradayik hinsa badi chintaa kii baat he
 He said that he would welcome it if the top leadership was more fierce against the fiercest statements
 yah ayog ek swatantra sarkari ayog he jiske ayuktaon ko america raashtrapati congress ke donon sadanon ke netaa niyukt karte hai
 The comments haalanki, ek sawaal ke jawaab main laantos sweate ne dharmik swatantraaa sunishchit karne par pradhanmantri narendra modi dwaara die kuch bayanon kaa swaagat kiya
 He said, 'we welcome and appreciate it

 Lantos Swet said, 'I find it somewhat incomprehensible and missing a great opportunity from India
 ' This is the third time since 2001 and 2009, when India has failed to issue visas to USCIRF members
 unhone kaha ki bharat ek mahaan samaaj he or duniya ke sarvaadhik mahatvapurn deshon main shaamil he
 He said that one should also hope that a democratic and pluralistic society like India would welcome the commission's visit
 bharat sarkaar dwaara liya gaya faisla rakshaatmak he

 This commission is an independent government commission whose commissioners are appointed by the US President as the leader of both houses of Congress

 piem modi (PM Modi) ne goa main raily ke dauraan congress party par jamkar hamalaa bolaa
 He said during this time that the Congress has played such games in defense deals that it has forced the valor of the brave soldiers of the country
 congress ke raaj main aisa koi raksha sauda nahin tha, jo andeh ke daayre main nahin tha
 PM Modi said that he ate brokerage in Bofors and drove away maternal uncle Quattrocchi
 parinaam ye hua ki dashakon tak hamaari sena ko ek nai top tak nahin mil pai
 Because nobody wanted to be a part of the sin of Congress
 unhone (PM Modi) kaha ki jab rafel kii kharid kii baat sena ne rakhi, to congress ke namdaar pariwaron ke khaas dalal isamen bhi lag gaye
 The result was that the deal was stuck for years and the power of the army kept decreasing
 phir 2014 se pehle ghotaalon se bhare maahaul ke bich congress ne rafel kaa dibba band kar diya
 There was a lot of brokerage in the chopper scam
 tarika vahi tha, boforce vaala
 Congress drove brokers like Michelle Mama overseas
 inako laga tha ki kwatroki ko jaise bhagaaya tha, vaise hi maamla dab jayega
 He did not even feel that the watchman would come and would search every middleman who had driven away from him
 piem modi (PM Modi) ne kaha ki ab dhire-dhire saare ghotaalon kii sachai saamne aa rahi he
 Brokerage wires are connecting
 is dauraan unhone congress ke netaa ahamed patel par bhi hamalaa bolaa
 He said that how much material the AP and the family got, it is coming out
 apane sambodhan ke dauraan piem modi ne goa ke divangat mukhyamantri manohar parrikar ko bhi yaad kiya
 He (PM Modi) said that today i have come among you at a time when a great son of the country, dedicated to the development of Goa, my friend Manohar Parrikar, is not with us
 apane samarpan bhav se, apane shram se kaise koi vyakti eemaandaaree se janhit main kaam kar saktaa he, ye parrikar ji ne karke dikhaaya
 Parrikar showed this by working on the path of development for all sections of the society
 piem modi ne kaha ki desh kaa raksha mantri rahete hue, desh ke sainikon ke prati, raashtra raksha ke liye zaruri faislon ko lekar jis samarpan bhav se manohar parrikar ji ne kaam kiya, wo athulaneey he
 During them, the surgical strike has laid the foundation of a new policy, a new way of a new India
 unhone kaha ki mujhe garv he ki manohar ji jaise saathi ke saath milakar bharat ke dephence doctrin ko nai disha dene kaa avasar mila
 PM Modi said during this time that Atal ji's government had taken a humanitarian decision for the martyrs of the country
 aaj jo shaheedon ke shav taabut main ghar aate hai, aisa pehle nahin hota tha
 The Union Government has received approval from the Lok Sabha to spend an additional Rs 80,000 under the Mega Plan to strengthen the public sector banks
 desh kii arthvyavastha ko majboot karne ke mega plan ke tahat kendra sarkaar ne 2
 It was proposed to give 80 thousand crore rupees by March 2018 to public banks under debt of Rs 1 lakh crore
 ab is prastaav par rajyasabha main bahes ho rahi he
 Significantly, in October 2017, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley approved the recapitalization of state-run banks
 lihaaja, biimaar bainkon ko ab 80 hajaar karod rupee kaa atirikt fund dekar koshish kii jaaegi ki desh main credit growth main ijaphe ke saath-saath nai naukariyaan paidaa karne kaa kaam kiya jaae
 Through this fund, public sector banks 2 within the next two years
 1 lakh karod rupee kaa capital ekatra karnaa he
 1 in this target of banks
 35 lakh karod rupee ke ricapiteligeshan bond bhi shaamil hai
 Read this: Before the merger of psbs, their npas need to be resolved: These banks will get the biggest benefit of this fund by the Raghuram Rajankendra government
 state bank of india gros enpie(non parforming asset) 9
 8 per cent, United Bank NPA 12
 4 fisadi, euko bank enpie 19
 7 percent, Dena Bank NPA 17
 2 fisadi, ityadi
 Helping loss-making banks through this new fund has become a compulsion for the government because where NPA 2 of these banks in March 2015
 75 lakh karod rupee tha jo june 2017 tak badhkar 7
 33 lakh crores has been exceeded
 bijepi main vah parivartan ho gaya, jiskaa andaaza bahut logon ko nahin tha
 Nitin Gadkari goes back to Nagpur and Rajnath Singh is called from Ghaziabad to Delhi, but, it is not yet clear when Narendra Modi, waiting to catch a flight from Ahmedabad to Delhi, will get a 'confirmed' ticket
 
 
 pichhlaa haftaa bijepi ke liye behad mahatvapurn rahaa
 Gadkari's departure and Rajnath's coronation led to several clues
 saaf ho gaya ki bijepi sanghathan par aresas kii pakad majboot bani rahegi or usamen koi bhi dheel nahin hogi, kyonki aresas saaf kar chukaa tha ki bijepi adhyaksh yaa to gadakari hi rahenge yaa phir rajnath singh banenge
 Second, despite the desire of the RSS, LK Advani is not ready to retire, but the way Advani played a big role in Gadkari's farewell has increased his stature among party workers and well-wishers
 adwani ne gadakari ko hatwakar bijpi ko na sirf bhrashtachar ke mudde par upie par phir aakraamak hone kaa mauka de diya he, balki is mudde par party kii girti saakh ko thaamne main bhi kamyaabi hasil kii he
 But the big question is whether Rajnath Singh's coronation is good news or bad for Narendra Modi
 
 
 rajnath singh ke pichley kaarykaal main donon netaaon ke rishte thik nahin the
 Rajnath Singh removed Modi from the party's highest decision making body, the Parliamentary Board
 varsh 2007 ke gujarat chunaav se thik pehle adwani ko endie kaa pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar ghoshit karaane main bhi rajnath kii bhoomika rahi thi or modi samarthakon kaa aarope tha ki yah gujarat chunaav main modi se dhyaan hataane or jeet ke baad unke raste main rode atakane kii koshish thi
 But now, if Rajnath Singh is seen changing, then Modi too
 
 
 narendra modi ne is baar gujarat chunaav se thik pehle apni vivekanand yatra ke liye rajnath ko khaastaur se aamantrit kiya, jo rajnath ke liye sukhad aashcharya tha
 Modi was also warmly welcomed by Rajnath when he visited Gujarat
 unke adhyaksh banane ke baad phone par badhai di or twitor par yaad dilaayaa ki rajnath desh ke sabase bade kisaan netaa hai
 When Rajnath Singh was asked whether the BJP would make Narendra Modi the Prime Ministerial candidate, his reply was that the Parliamentary Board would take a decision on this in due time, but Rajnath was very appreciative of Modi
 unhone kaha ki modi rashtriya netaa hai or gujarat main unhone vikaas kaa model banaaya he
 Later he also said that he would talk to him and other party leaders to decide Modi's role at the national level
 modi ke liye rashtriya prachaar abhiyaan samiti ke adhyaksh kii bhoomika kii baat kii ja rahi he, lekin lagata nahin ki modi iske liye taiyaar honge
 
 
 Rather, unless Modi decides to make Modi a solid 'BJP face', Modi would not want to leave Gujarat
 media ke kuch hisson kii khabaron ke vipareet aresas modi ko badi bhoomika saunpane kaa man bana chukaa he
 According to sources, in an internal meeting of the Sangh in the last week of December, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat had said that no one can stop Narendra Modi from becoming the Prime Minister
 raajnneeti main bada faisla timming kaa hota he
 Formally declaring Modi as bjp's prime ministerial candidate means losing the support of Nitish Kumar in Bihar
 
 
 isiilie party netaa unhen prachaar samiti kaa pramukh banaakar bich kaa rasta nikaalnaa chaahate hai, lekin modi chaahate hai ki unhen jo bhi zimmedaari di jaae, vah bina laag−lapet ke di jaae
 This is a big test for Rajnath on how he resolves this question
 sawaal yah bhi he ki halke-phulke gadakari ke mukaable rajnath singh kaa raajnneetik vazan bahut zyada he
 His ambitions to become Prime Minister are not hidden
 haalanki ab vah kah rahe hai ki vah piem pad kii daud main nahin hai, or apni puri takat sanghathan ko majboot karne par hi lagaayenge, lekin satta or sanghathan main santulan durlabh he
 Especially when the key of the organization is with someone else (RSS)

 co / db6oi3fijd— Salman Khan (@beingsalmankhan)june 19, 2015dekhen film 'bajrangi bhaijan' kaa doosraa gaanaa 'tu chahie': Former Deputy Chief Minister of Bihar Sushil Kumar Modi has gently given a jolt to Nitish Kumar on the pretext of Prashant Kishore, a consultant to Chief Minister Nitish Kumar
 up-mukhyamantri susheel kumaar modi ne mukhyamantri ke paramarshi prashanth kishor kii bhoomika par sawaal uthaate hue unase apane pad se istipha dene kii maang kii
 Accusing Prashant Kishore on the pretext of Prashant Kishore, Nitish said that on behalf of the Bihar government 9 without making a vision document of Bihar to Citizen Alliances, which had a relationship with Prashant Kishore
 31 karod rupee kaa bhugtan prashanth kishor ke prabhaav ke kaaran kar diya gaya
 However, a statement has been issued dismissing the allegations of Prashant Kishore Sushil Modi, stating that a detailed report of about 40 thousand villages has been submitted to the Ministry of Information, in which the situation of the villages is analyzed
 unhone kaha ki paison kaa bhugtan sabhi reporton ko veriphai karne ke baad citigen elanyas company ke dwaara kiya gaya he or abhi bhi 7 yaa 8 jilon kaa bhugtan baaki he
 In the name of making Bihar's vision document, BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi attacked Nitish Kumar over Prashant Kishore and Vision Document, saying that the Bihar government gave the responsibility of creating a vision document to a company named Citizen Alliance
 is company kaa sidhaa sambandh mukhyamantri ke paramarshi prashanth kishor se he
 But in the last 8 months, this company did nothing in the name of creating a vision document and 9 from the government
 31 karod rupee kaa bhugtan bhi le liya
 He said that if the vision document of Bihar had been made, then it would have been very easy to make the 15-year vision document suggested by the central government to all the states

 Giving to the minister
 lekin pichley aath maheene main prashanth kishor maatr ek yaa do baar hi bihar aae, aise main wo kya paraamarsh mukhyamantri ko dete honge iskaa andaja lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Prashant Sushil Kumar Modi, who is not fulfilling the responsibility, said that Bihar Development Mission has met only twice
 pichhali baithak jo 21 may 2016 ko hui thi us baithak main prashanth kishor anupasthit the, pichley chaar maheene se prashanth kishor ek baar bhi bihar nahin aae hai
 The big reason for this is that together they remain the advisors of the Congress for the assembly elections to be held in states like UP and Punjab
 modi ne kaha ki jaankaree ye bhi he ki prashanth kishor ko jagmohan reddy ne bhi andhra pradesh main hone vaale chunaav ke liye salaahkaar niyukt kiya he
 Prashant Kishore is unable to discharge the responsibilities of Chief Minister's advisory due to election responsibilities in three states, so he has no fundamental right to hold his post

 Why was the payment of Rs 31 crore? He asked Chief Minister Nitish Kumar that when Prashant Kishore is unable to discharge his duties then why has he been retained in this post? Prashant Kishore has made allegations against Nakabihar Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi
 Prashant Kishore rejected outright
 mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ke paramarshi prashanth kishor ne kaha ki jhootha aarope lagane ke aarope main ve susheel kumaar modi ko kanoonee notish bhejenge
 He said that during the election campaign also he had made similar allegations on which legal notices were sent to him
 prashanth kishor ne kaha ki bihar ke 40 hajaar gaanv kii report ke kagajaat ek maah pehle hi ipiardi vibhaag ko saunpi ja chuki he
 He told Sushil Kumar Modi that you can send a cameraman and make a video of that report

 unhone kaha ki in chalis hajaar gaanvon kii report ke aadhaar par jahaan tak vijan document banane kaa sawaal he to ye jimmaa bihar ke sarkari agency ko diya gaya he naa ki citigen elanyas ko
 Prashant Kishore said that he has no relationship with a company named Citizen Alliances
 saath hi unke or citigen elanyas company ke bich kabhi bhi koi len-dein nahin hua he
 Prashant Kishore while replying to each of the allegations raised by Sushil Modi said that as far as the post of advisory is concerned, i said in writing from day one that they will not take any financial assistance

 " madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ne yah kahkar vivaad khadaa kar diya ki rajyasabha ko samaapt kar dena chahie, kyonki iske sadsy banane ke liye badi sankhya main raashi kharch kii ja rahi he, jisase sansad kaa yah upree sadan ek ‘bazaar’ kii tarah ho gaya he
 However, a few hours after making this statement Shivraj Singh Chauhan regretted that he had deep faith in constitutional bodies like Rajya Sabha
 chouhan ne kingfisher company ke maalik vijay maalya kaa paroksh rup se ullekh karte hue kaha ki ‘kingfisher’ se log rajyasabha main aa rahe hai
 Mallya has business interests in the liquor and aviation industries, among other areas, becoming a Rajya Sabha MP for the second time
 bhaajapa netaa ne vyangyatmak dhang se kaha, ‘‘jo log kharch karte hai ek tarah kaa nivesh karte hai jise ve baad main nikaal lete hai
 "he said in the regional discussion on election reforms in the Madhya Pradesh Legislative Assembly," i believe the time has come when Rajya Sabha is abolished for which the candidates spend a large amount
 iske sthaan par rajyasabha sadasyon ke liye loksabhaa main hi kota nirdhaarit kar diya janaa chahie
 "he said," Candidates are spending huge sums of money to become Rajya Sabha members
 ’’unhone kaha ki paise kii takat vaale vyakti sansad ke upari sadan main pravesh ko icchhuk hai
 Chauhan said, "what is the need of Rajya Sabha? The country already has a powerful institution like the Lok Sabha, which is run by the people's elected representatives
 rajyasabha kaa gathan aise logon ke liye kiya gaya tha jo chunaav nahin lard sakate the
 For example, scientists, artists, writers and intellectuals
 lekin ab kingfisher ke log rajyasabha main pahunch rahe hai
 However, later in a hasty night at a press conference held at his residence, he said, "I had said something in a seminar on election reform held earlier in the day
" main rajya vidhansabhaon, loksabhaa or rajyasabha kii pratishtha ko banaaye rakhane ko lekar chintit hum
 "as far as Rajya Sabha is concerned, it is a constitutional body, i have great respect for it and the members in it," he said
 mere bayaan ko yadi logon ne anyathaa le liya he to main iske liye khed jataata hum
 The Chief Minister refused to answer any question regarding this
 chouhan ne rajyasabha main maalya kii maujuudagi kii ore ishaara karte hue kaha, ‘‘kabhi kingfisher ke log rajyasabha pahunch rahe hai
 Rajya Sabha tickets are being sold openly, it has become like a market, it is a shame
 ’’ unhone vichaar vyakt karte hue kaha, ‘‘rajyasabha chunaavon ke sthaan par ek aisi vyavastha banaayi jaani chahie jisamen angl bhartiya ko sansad main namankit kiya jaye
 He said that Lok Sabha and Assembly elections should be held simultaneously in the country for five years
 ’’unhone kaha ki baar-baar chunaav karaane se vikaas gatividhiyaan prabhavit ho rahi hai, kyonki chunaav ke samay chunaav aachaar samhita lagu kerani hoti he
 He also expressed concern over the use of black money in elections and said that steps should be taken to stop it
 chouhan ne chunaav main sarkari kharch kii jarurat par jor dete hue kaha ki chunaavon main kaledhan ke istemaal par roak lagegi
 He said, "no party can run without funds
 ek aisi vyavastha banani chahie ki party ke liye aarthik madad check se hi lee jaae

 In Padmavati, we have shown more courage than physical beauty and beauty of tradition
 padmavati kaa kirdaar mere liye mastaani se kahin zyada chunauteepurn rahaa he
 How did it feel to shoot in heavy clothes and jewelry? In response to this question, Deepika said, 'when you do with Sanjay Leela Bhansali, you don't have to count the days

 i too never felt that during the Ghoomar Song i kept a three kg borla on my head or how many heavy jewels i have worn
 jab bhansaali ection bolte hai, to costum se hatakar sara dhyaan kirdaar par aa jaataa he
 After the shoot, it is known how much pain and how much it hurt

 Sanjay Leela Bhansali gave a surprise gift to Deepika for 'ghoomar'
 It was a risky decision
 On the issue of Unibrow, Deepika says that there has been a bounded definition of beauty for the audience, we have tried to make Padmavati look different from physical beauty
 , It can be called taking a risk, but the beauty of Padmavati lies in it

 padosi mulk nepal ke pokhara main rah rahe yaccin bhatkal ke kiraye ke makaan par jab intelligence beuro, bihar police or nepal ke adhikariyon kii ek sanyukt team ne 28 agast ko dhaava bolaa to aatank ke is sargana ke chehre par shikan tak nahin thi
 He insisted, "I am an engineer
 aap galat aadmi ko pakad rahe hai
 "yasin, directly responsible for the killing of more than 200 Indians, always used the same tactic to hide from the law for five consecutive years
" ankhon par pattee baandhakar yaccin ko uthaa liya gaya or ek anjaan jagah par le jaakar usase poochtacha kii gai
 He constantly hid his identity and described himself as a Pakistani passport holder
 is gatirodh kaa ant tab hua, jab pulisavaalon ne uski naak tod di
 Then he accepted all the things
 philhal neshnal investigeshan agency (enie) apni sabase badi pakad se dilli main jawaab-talab kar rahi he or unhen uski ahmiyat samaj main aane lagi he
 "we have caught only the pawns till now," says an undercover officer
 yaccin kaa maamla alag he
 He is one of the founding members of the Indian Mujahideen (IM)
 vah iem kaa commander he, jo duusare aatankiyon ko nirdeshit karata tha
 "yasin was very confident and had no regrets about his actions
" pichley paanch saal ke dauraan uski jo sanak hamane dekhi, usamen ek khaas rujhaan rahaa: chaahe ve pune kii german bekri main cold coffee kii chuskiyaan lete paryatak rahe hon, dakshin mumbai main bheedbhad ke vakt chote vyapaaree yaa phir hyderabad ke bahari ilaake dilasukhanagar main dosa khaane jate chaatr, sab uske dhamaakon kaa shikaar bane
 When asked about the innocent children who were killed in his bombings, he said, "so what happened?" People die all the time
 meraa kaam bharat sarkaar ko ek sandesh bhejnaa tha
 i have slept peacefully - from my first operation to the last i have never had a bad dream
 ''yaccin ne apane kiye ke bachaav main granthon kaa bhi hawala diya
 He gave the example of the Bhagavad Gita, saying that he was not taking anyone's life, but was getting souls to attain salvation
 usase sawaal poochne vaale ek bade ipies adhikari use maovadiyon jaisaa nirdayee bataate hai, jo logon kii hatya karke bhi kathor bane rahete hai
 He says, "in my career, i have not seen a more hardened terrorist
" ''yaccin ko pakadaaey ke baad uski madad se guptchar adhikari duusare bam hamalon ko bhi taalane main kaamyaab ho rahe hai
 For example, he had told the authorities that two terrorists - Tehsim Akhtar alias Monu of Samastipur in Bihar and Pakistani terrorist Waqas have entered India to target important targets
 usase baatcheet karke afasaron ko karachi se chalane vaale iem kii karypranali ke bare main bhi jaankaree mil rahi he
 According to Yasin, the supporters of IM present all over the world are unhappy with his 'low power bombing'
 iske chalate iem ko loksabhaa chunaav aane tak ahm thikaanon par dhamaake karne ke liye nai timen gathit karne ko majaboor hona padaa he
 Leaders are most at risk during elections
 usne bataaya ki gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi sabase bada nishaanaa the kyonki un tak pahunchane kaa matlab tha ki duniyabar ke samarthakon se paise kii aamad bad jaati
 Like lashkar-e-taiba, IM also received a lot of money after the 26 / 11 attacks
 yaccin kii giraftaar se kuch din pehle hi karachi sthit riyaj bhatkal (rishtedaar nahin) ne use hawala se do lakh ru
 Had sent iem ke bheetar asantosh or daraar sambandhi yaccin ke daavon kii jaanch ab bhi agenciyon ko kerani he, lekin ek baat gaur karne vaali he ki iem ke bheetar ek dhada asantusht or kattar he, jisane apane sansthaapakon ikbaal or riyaj bhatkal ke aadesh maanane band kar die hai or sidhe apane pakistani aakaaon ke sampark main rahata he
 In the interrogation of Yasin, other terrorist cases are also likely to be resolved, such as the July 2006 train blasts in Mumbai, in which 209 people were killed
 ho saktaa he ki poochtacha main seemaa paar se iem ko nirdeshit kar rahe tatwon ke naam bhi saamne aa jaaen
 Headley told that Pakistan's landlord was the first David Coleman Headley to give details of bomb blasts in India's cities
 hedli 26 / 11 hamale main shaamil tha
 In 2010, he highlighted the 'karachi project' in a conversation with four NIA officers in a US prison
 bhartiya agenciyon ko 2002 se chal rahi ek sajeesh kaa sirf andaja bhar tha
 The entire operation began in Pakistan's largest city, where Muslim youth were trained in bomb making to carry out light-intensity terrorist attacks in Indian cities
 jaisaa guptchar adhikari bataate hai ki in hamalon ke do makasad the
 The first objective was to attack the Indian economy with serial blasts
 saath hi is tarah hamalaa karnaa ki usamen pakistan kii sanliptata na jaahir ho
 Headley named 45-year-old Major Abdurrahman Hashim, a retired officer of the Pakistani army, who worked to bring the project closer to the ISI
 yah major enie kii most wanted suchi main 'gol chehre vaala, lahim-shaheem' bataaya gaya he, jo 'pasha' takhllus lagaataa he or bharat ke 50 most wanted bhagodon kii suchi main jamaat-ud-daawa (jeyudi) ke hafiz said or 26 / 11 hamale main shaamil rahe sajid mir ke baad tisare number par aata he
 It left the Pakistani Army in 2002, after which it worked to train Fidayeen for Lashkar
 yah kaam iesai ke ek afasar kii nigaraanee main chalata rahaa, jise hedli ne 'karnal shah' ke taur par pahachaanaa he
 Abdurrahman split from the Lashkar in 2008 and independently run the 'set up' of Karachi
 rahamaan kaa daawa tha ki vah osama bin laden kaa kareebi he
 He refused to attack al Qaeda fighters fleeing Tora Bora in 2001 while in Pakistani military
 rahamaan ne hedli ko bataaya tha ki 2006 main mumbai kii train main hue dhamaake uske 'ladakon' ne hi kiye the or bin laden ne uske sanghathan ko jund-ul-fida (fidayinon kii fouj) naam diya he

 pakistan apni napak harakat se baj aane kaa naam nahin le rahaa he
 At first he was reluctant to leave the Indian Air Force wing commander Abhinandan and tried to bargain, but when India did not agree, he left Abhinandan
 haalanki, abhinandan kii rihaai ke kuch minute pehle pakistan apni napak chalbaaji dikhaa gaya
 He forcibly made a video with Abhinandan and praised his army in it
 itnaa hi nahin, is video ko abhinandan ko bharat ko saunpane se mahaj kuch minute pehle pakistani media main chalaaya gaya
 In this video, Abhinandan was shown saying that the Pakistani Army is a professional
 usne hi unako logon se bachaaya or acha vyavhaar kiya
 One thing is clear from watching the video that what Abhinandan is saying in it was edited and presented
 unte dedh minute ke video main 15 se zyada cat dekhe gaye

 During this time the mig-21 fighter aircraft of the Indian Air Force also fell and the pilot Abhinandan reached the occupied part of Pakistan
 iske baad pakistani sena ne unako bandhak bana liya tha
 There was a lot of ruckus about this and India asked to release Wing Commander Abhinandan
 bharat kii chetavanee ke baad guuruuvaar ko pakistan ke pradhanmantri imran khan ne sansad ke sanyukt satr ko sambodhit karte hue elaan kiya ki wo shuukravaar ko wing commander abhinandan ko chhod denge

 BJP President Amit Shah on Tuesday began a statewide march till Trivandrum in Kerala's Kannur district on October 3

 kuch din pehle hi ek report ai thi ki ejineering course karne ke baavjood bhi kaaphi yuva berozegaar hai
 They are finding it difficult to get jobs
 is samasya kaa solution nikaalte hueol india council for technical ajukeshan (aicte)ne ejineering students ke behatar bhavishya ke liye ek ahm faisla liya he
 These miraculous pens are 100% guaranteed by the board to pass the exams! Students now doing engineering will not be awarded degrees until they complete the internship
 kaha ja rahaa he ki ejineering ke student ke liye ye faisla lene kaa makasad he ki unhen market main kaam karne ke laayak banaaya jaae, ve industry ko samajhen ki vahaan kaam karne kaa tarika kaisaa he

 Dance is not considered a very good career option in India
 yahi vajah he ki dance ko log apane pishan ke taur par to khub pasand karte hai, par baat jab profeshnal kariyar kii hoti he to daancing ko darkinar kar dete hai
 But these days, a change is being seen in people's thinking towards it
 desh ke mashhoor dance guru shyaamak dower ne bataaya ki kaise aap apane dance kii hobbi ko apana profshnal kariyar bana sakate hai
 This is how to handle 'work pressure' dance in a senior office without having to handle it
 It is necessary to take care of some things to achieve success in the field of dancing
 haalanki dekha jaae to kisi bhi kshetra main safalataa is baat par nirbhar karti he ki aap uske liye kitni mehnat kar rahe hai or usase kitna pasand karte hai, par daancing ke kshetra main kariyar banane ke liye yah or bhi jaruri ho jaati he ki aapane uske liye kitni mehnat kii he
 Here are some similar things, without which you probably will not be able to achieve success in the field of dancing
 
 
 - kadi mehnat or sahi trainingvikaf par bos naa de 'of' to aise karen offis main khud ko 'chiyaahp- jaiz takanic, ballat eksrasij, yogasana, dance therapy activity, theatre arts- dance expressant- dance kshetra kii jaankaree- dance main rachanaatmakataa- dance kii takneekee jaankarijab offis main haaavee ho tanaav, to ye karen janaab
 
 
 - Musical theater and stage performance- Do not be afraid of stage- In the field of self-confidence, you can make a career here: - You can teach dance to people of different ages, give them private coaching- can give stage performance- Dance in live shows and films can be stress when dominating in office, so do it sir
 
 
 - sangeet or wedding main dance- celibrity dance tener ban sakate hai- NGO main bacchon ko dance sikhaa sakate hai Nitin Ramesh Gokarn said that if any person has any oral or written evidence related to BHU incident, he can present it in his office on Monday from 9:00 am to 11:00 am

 Senator Sanders of Vermont, who was campaigning for the presidency, responded immediately to the slogan of democratic socialism
 sanders ne ek bayaan main kaha, jaisaa ki har roj hi ho rahaa he, donald trump america janata ko dikhaa rahe hai ki vah ek bimaaru kism ke jhuthe vyakti hai
 i am happy that there were people supporting us at Trump's rally in Chicago, but these protests were not organized by our campaign

 Neil Nitin Mukesh was recently seen in the film Saaho
 film main unka negative kirdaar tha
 The film has received mixed reviews but it is racking up at the box office
 film main bahubali fame superstar prabhas or shraddha kapur ne lead role nibhaayaa he
 The film has so far crossed the 100 crore mark at the Indian box office
 mahaj chaar maichon ke apane chote-se test kariyar main hi moin ali apane damakham kaa parichay de chuke the
 England were chasing 350 to save their series against Sri Lanka in Leeds this summer
 27 varshiya moin 108 ran par naabad rahe jabaki unki team ke baaki khilaadi saste main hi pavilion laut gaye, or unamem ek bhi khilaadi ardhshtak tak bhi nahin pahunch paaya tha
 Again, his team did not need their runs against India at Southampton
 team pehle hi pahaad-sa score khadaa kar chuki thi (7 wicket par 569, pari ghoshit)
 But in his 12-run innings, Ali, wearing two bands on his wrist, made the world of cricket come to terms with many questions on the combination of sports and politics as to how acceptable a display of sympathy can be on the field, and How the power of the game can be used for good
 england and wales cricket board (isibi) ne samajhadaari or sahanubhuti purna najariya apanaaya ki ali ne bhale band pahanane (seve gaja yani gaja ko bachaao or free falstin yani falstin ko aaazaad karo) kii jaankaree nahin di thi, lekin baad main unhen isse roka bhi nahin gaya
 "moeen did nothing wrong," said a spokesperson
 ”is tarah yah daleel di gai ki unhone siyaasi nahin, balki maanviya samvednaa jaahir kii thi
 (it is no coincidence that the liberation of Palestinian territories has been written in a bi-national solution to which Israel is committed, and Ali was not giving any revolutionary, provocative or any kind of separatist message
 )lekin antarrashtriya cricket parishad (isisi) is daleel se sahamat nahin hui or band pahanane par pratibandh laga diya
 In such a situation, if the ICC believes that there should be no mixing of sports and politics, then this would not be digested
 hajam ho bhi kaise sakati
 The BCCI treasury is considered the Indian Premier League, and which is why it controls the ICC
 isi lig main chennai main khele jane vaale maichon main srilanka ke khiladinnon ko maidan main na utarane dene kii dhamkee maan lee gai
 The first responsibility of the game is sportsmanship and by doing so, the game spirit was turned away
 yahaan besil di’olivera ke maamle ko halkaa karke dekhne jaisi koi baat nahin
 See more! In the auction for IPL franchises, Pakistan's talented players do not even get any buyers
 isibi ke maamle main to baat or bhi hajam nahin ho sakati, jab dashakabar pehle usne robert mugabe ke zimbabwe main world cap ke match khilne kii jimmedaari apane hi khiladinnon par chhodkar kanni kaat lee thi
 Nasir Hussain in his autobiography described him as "the most tragic period of his life"
 ye sabhi maamle bisisiai or isibi ke jimmedaari se dur bhaagane kii kahani kehete hai
 But the question is not whether the cricket ground is open to all kinds of slogans
 asal main prashaskon ko zyada sahanubhutipurna ravaiya apnaane kii jarurat he ki aakhir koi sandesh is tarah dena jaij he yaa nahin
 In fact, the playground has become the easiest place for people's interest and public view
 khiladinnon ne apane-apane akele ke str par isamen misaal banaai he
 From David Vallechinsky's collection of references on the Olympics, we know that India's champion hockey players were seen marching in the field of Berlin with the British flag in 1936 but they were waving the tricolor in the dressing room (which is the flag of Indian National Congress Was)
 1968 main mexico city main 200 meter ke teen athleton ne apana sammaan tyaag diya tha, jo kisi myne main record kaayam karne vaale mahaan athleton-maaikel johnson or usan bolt se kamatar nahin tha
 America's Tommy Smith and John Carlos (gold and bronze winners) came barefoot at the medal ceremony when they waved their black gloves in the air and saluted the black power, causing panic in the International Olympic Committee
 shuru main america cameti unke saath khadi hui lekin apane duusare athleton ke bhi baahar kar die jane ke dar se usne hathiyaar daal die
 (the support Smith and Carlos received from silver medalist Australian Peter Norman was an outstanding display of courage
 )kaha jaataa he ki khilaadi hamaare aap jaise saamaanya log nahin hote
 But they are young and extraordinary men and women
 ve apane pradarshan se darshakon ko unki roj kii duniyaadaari se kahin aage le jate hai
 When they take any progressive step, they and we should also know why we cannot do that
 or is kyon or kyon nahin ke bich seemaa rekha tabhi khinchi ja sakati he, jab prashaasak apane faislon kii pukhta daleel pesh karen
 This will help in understanding what to do and who to back off from
 agasta westland main bichauliye chrishchiyan mishael ke pratyrpan ke baad ab modi sarkaar jor-shor se kaarobaari vijay maalya ko swadesh laane main juty he
 The London court has also approved Mallya's extradition to India
 bharat ise badi jeet ke rup main dekh rahi he
 However, Mallya has options to appeal to the upper court there
 agar modi sarkaar vijay maalya ko bharat laane main kaamyaab rahati he tab yah sarkaar ke liye badi jeet maani jaaegi
 The message will go to the public that the government will not spare any accused of cheating the country
 saath hi vitt mantri arun jetali ke liye maalya kii vaapasi badi raahat kii khabar hogi
 When Mallya took Jaitley's name because Mallya himself had spoken to Arun Jaitley for settlement before leaving India and since then Jaitley has been on the target of opposition
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne to vijay maalya ko bharat se bhagane main arun jetali par kathith madad kaa aarope bhi lagaaya he
 So as soon as the court of London's Westminster Magistrate on Monday approved the extradition of Sevijay Mallyaki, Arun Jaitley himself tweeted and cheered, writing, 'today is a big day for India
 bharat se dhokhadhadi karne vaala koi bhi sajaa se nahin bachegaa
 a criminal was benefited during the UPA government
 haalanki endie sarkaar usko waapas laa rahi he
 'mallya's comeback and 2019 election? Arun Jaitley's tweet shows that the stains that have come on Mallya's return will wash away him, as well as a big weapon for the Modi government to silence the opposition
 haalanki sarkaar kii koshish rahegi kii kisi bhi tarah se 2019 loksabhaa chunaav se pehle maalya ko bharat laane main kamyaabi mil jaae
 With Mallya's return, the image of the government, which has been slightly tarnished in the public, will shine and then in the Lok Sabha elections 'mallya's return' can ease the path of 'government's return'
 deele pade vijay maalya ke tevarhaalanki kaha ja rahaa he janvari ke aakhri tak vijay maalya ko bharat waapas laayaa ja saktaa he
 The court has given Mallya 15 days to appeal in the upper court
 is bich apane upar shikanja kasata dekh maalya ke bhi tevar deele padane lage hai, ab bainkon ke paise vaapasi kii baat karne lage hai
 Speaking to the media before the court hearing, Mallya said, 'I did not steal anyone's money
 maine bainkon kaa puraa paisa chukaane kii baat kii thi
 Extradition has nothing to do with repaying the dues
 'jabaki ek twit main maalya ne kaha, 'jahaan tak bainkon ke paison kii baat he to maine ise puraa 100 pratishat lautaane kii peshkash kii he
 i humbly ask the bank and the government to take the money
 agar meri peshkash ko asweekaar kar diya gaya to kyon?'neerav modi bhi radar parbata den, vijay maalya bhartiya bainkon ke 9,000 karod rupee ke karj kii adaayagi nahin karne ke maamle kaa saamana kar rahaa he
 He fled to Britain in March 2016, taking advantage of the dilution of the cbi's lookout notice against him
 vijay maalya ke alaava hira kaarobaari neerav modi or rahul chaukasee bhi modi sarkaar ke radar par hai
 There is no relief to Mallya from the SC, but Mallya has also suffered a setback from the Supreme Court, the largest court in the country
 pravartan nideshaalay (idi) ne vijay maalya ko bhagoda aarthik apradhi ghoshit kar uski sampattiyaan jabt karne kii kaarywahi shuru kar di he
 Against which Vijay Mallya had filed a petition in the Supreme Court through his lawyer, but the court flatly refused to stay the ED proceedings
 landan kii court main maalya par sunwaayeegauratlab he ki bharat lambey vakt se maalya ke pratyrpan kii koshish kar rahaa he
 Earlier, other powers including CBI have gone to London
 yahaan tak ki landan main maalya kii giraftaar bhi ho chuki he, lekin use jamaanat mil gai thi
 Now it has to be seen how long the investigative agencies are able to bring Vijay Mallya to India like Christian Mitchell
 kanhaiya ne kaha, fees vruddhi se garib-kisaan ke bachche nahin pard paaengekanhaiya ne poocha, kya sarkaar 5 hajaar bacchon ko acchhee shiksha nahin de sakatifis badhotaree ke khilaaf pradarshan karne vaale jawaharlal nehru vishvavidhyalay (jeenyu) ke chaatro ne kendriya maanav sansaadhan mantri se aashwaasan milane ke baad dharna khatm kar diya
 After that, the delegation of students met Human Resources Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal 'nishank'
 mantri ne fees badhotaree waapas lene kaa aashwaasan diya he
 Kanhaiya Kumar, former president of JNU student organization, spoke to 'india Today' on this issue
 kanhaiya kumaar ne sarkaar ke ravaiye par sawaal uthaaya or kaha ki jeenyu main garib chaatr padhate hai isliye fees nahin badhaai jaani chahie
 On the question of refund of fee hike, she said on the question of increase in fee duty, Kanhaiya Kumar said, 'an atmosphere is being created about JNU that its students are protesting without reason, doing politics which is a lie
 jeenyu main jis tarah se fees vruddhi kii gai he usase 100 main se 40 fisadi chaatr padhai nahin kar paaenge
 These 40 per cent students are such whose monthly income of the family is 12 thousand rupees
 fees vruddhi agar lagu kii jaati he to jeenyu desh kii sabase mahangi central uniwarsity ho jaaegi
 Then students who come from poor-peasant family will not be able to study
 isiilie jeenyu ke vidhyaarthee yah andolan kar rahe hai
 With regard to the withdrawal of the fee hike, Kanhaiya Kumar said that this is a lie because it has been implemented right after making minor changes in it
 taxperes ke paise se murti nirmanjeenyu chaatro ko milane vaali sabsidi se jude ek sawaal par kanhaiya kumaar ne 'india today' se kaha, is desh ke parliament main jo saansad jate hai unke khaane par sabsidi he, unke rahane parasbsidihai
 As far as taxpayers 'money is concerned, a statue of 3 thousand crores is being made with taxpayers' money, private jet is being bought for the chief minister with taxpayers 'money, is it not a waste of taxpayers' money? 5 trillion Economy and good education, Kumar further said, when our Prime Minister says that we are going to build five trillion key economies, is there a cost of 5000 thousand in the country Taxes may not be a good education? As far as JNU is concerned, nothing is being given to any student in the bailout
 ol india level par pariksha paas kar log jeenyu main admician lete hai
 The situation of the country is that only 3 percent people come in higher education, less than 1 percent people are able to join the research program
 isliye yah bolnaa ki research main paisa barabaad kiya ja rahaa he, yah apane aap main bahut haasyaaspad he
 Good research is needed to make any country better
 jeenuekmaatr uniwarsity he jo soshal science main achche research produs karti he
 Shout out to the police-students, a massive traffic jam has arisen in central Delhi on Monday due to the protests by JNU students
 pradarshnkaree chaatro ko sansad kii taraf badhane se roak diya gaya, jis kaaran police ke saath unki nokajhonk bhi hui
 The administration closed the gates of three metro stations near Parliament House to prevent students from reaching Parliament
 police ne iske pehle sansad bhawan kii taraf juluus ke rup main bad rahe chaatro ko rokane ke liye safadarajang makbare ke paas bairicads laga die
 The Parliament has started on the weekly session of the Parliament

 The 2010 FIFA World Cup held in South Africa will be remembered for many good and bad things, but if the biggest mistake of this battle is seen, it will remain in the name of Ghana who missed the chance to enter the semi-finals to become the first African country
 Achievement was missing, while England goalkeeper Green's omission has been written in the pages of history
 maidan par or iske baahar kai badi galtiyaan hui lekin ye bhoolen aisi hai jo logon ke dimag main buree yaadon kii tarah tarotaaja rahengi, haalanki isamen refariyon ke galat faisle se hue vivaad bhi shaamil hai
 The controversy of the official ball of the World Cup 'jabulani' will also be recorded in the history of this World Cup
 kintu agar refariyon ko chhodkar maidan ke andar ke pradarshan kii baat kii jaye to ghana visheshkar asamoh gyaan ko yah dard hameshaa hi salata rahegaa ki ve pehali baar vishwa cap ke semifinal main pahunchane vaali dakshin africa team ke rup main apana naam itihaas main darj karaane se kareeb se chook gayi
 The quarterfinal match between Ghana and Uruguay was running into extra time and headed to a penalty shootout after a 1–1 draw, when Ghana would have scored the winning goal but Uruguay's Luis Suarez handed the ball from outside the goal line Stopped which showed him a red card and Ghana got a penalty
 lekin unke star striker gyaan kaa penlti shaat baahar chalaa gaya or ghana penlti shoot out main urugway se 4-2 se haar gaya 
 On the one hand, Argentina's legendary player Diego Maradona is associated with 'hand of Gad' in the 1986 World Cup, while Suarez's name has also been registered in the 'notorious' category
 suarej ko haalanki is baat kaa koi pachhtaawaa nahin tha or unhone kaha ki ab ‘hand aaf gad’ kaa tamgaa mere naam ho gaya he jabaki yah jaanboojhkar kii gayi galati bhi is vishwa cap ke liye yaad kii jaayegi
 At the same time, England's goalkeeper Robert Green's terrible mistake against America was also the reason for his exit from the tournament as the 'three Lions' got only one point from this and made sure that they would not remain at the top of their group
 The reason they faced Germany in the last 16 was that they defeated them 4–1
 france kii team ke andar hui samasya bhi aitihaasik rahi, jiske baad media ne khilaadiyon or coach donon kii kaaphi aalochana kii
 The team's star striker Nicholas Anelka has abused head coach Raymond Domenech after he lost to Mexico and refused to apologize
 enelka ko iske baad france footbal mahasang ne swadesh bhej diya gaya or isi mudde par captain patris evera kii trainer robert duvarne ke saath kahasuni ho gayi jiske virodhswaroop khilaadiyon ne training kaa bahishkaar kar diya

 a complaint filed against Aamir Khan in Delhi, Ulhas PR, who made a short film on the statement of film actor Aamir Khan, has filed a complaint against him on Tuesday
 yah shikaayat dilli ke new ashok nagar thane main darj karai gai he
 Aamir's statement is being criticized and supported at this time
 ulhas ne kaha ki hamaari kuch buniyadi jimmedaariyaan hai, jo kahati hai ki hamen rashtramen sauhardra bananaa chahie
 So when celebrities make such a statement, they should first tell which society they are talking about, where people are living in an atmosphere of fear? Ulhas had earlier lodged a complaint against Aamir even after the release of the film 'PK'
 unhone film main pulisavaalon ko 'thulla' kehane ko shikaayat kaa aadhaar banaaya tha
 He said, 'celebrities should think about their status and responsibilities before saying anything

 The accused confessed his crime and said that he was intoxicated by alcohol at midnight on Saturday
 usee dauraan use shouch ke liye janaa tha
 But due to vehicles standing on the way, he had a lot of trouble in defecating
 isi baat se naaraaz hokar aaropee ne ek bike kaa petrol nikaalkar vahaan khadey sabhi vaahanon menagalga di
 Surprisingly, a police post is also present at some distance from where the arson took place
 lekin ghatana ke bare main police waalon ko kuch pataa nahin tha
 The police reached the spot on giving information
 is ghatana se dattvadi ilaake main dehshat fail gai thi
