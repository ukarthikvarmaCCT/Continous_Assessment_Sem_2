 So London's porcelain disappears from the mind in the first half of the film

 The story of the film is based on rebirth
 film ke first half main san 1419 kii kahani dikhaai jaati he or duusare half main 2019 kii
 Coming to the story of 1419, Prince Bala (akshay Kumar) of Madhavgarh has been evicted from the kingdom by his father
 bala behad hi krur or matlabi rajkumaar he
 After which he wants to take revenge from his father by going to Sitamgarh and marry the elder princess Madhu (kriti Senan) and grab the entire kingdom
 taaki wo baad main apane pita par hamalaa kar unase badla le sake

 The electoral movement in the country is extremely fast
 har party jodtod main lagi he ki kaise sansad main apni takat badhayen
 We all know that the road to power in the country always goes through Uttar Pradesh
 jahaan satta bachaane ke liye bijepi apane saathiyon se maan manwwal main juty he, vahiin bhaajapa ko satta se bedakhal karne ke liye rajya ke do viparit dhruv sapa or basapa ek saath aa gaye
 This alliance of bua-babua sparked the strings of the BJP supporters as all the surveys show that if anyone can stop the BJP from coming to power, then it is the alliance of Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party
 bijepi se sidhaa muqabla bhi isi gathbandhan kaa he
 But there are some startling figures in the 2014 election results
 agar isi voting pattern ko sahi maan liya jaae to sirf 35 aisi siten hai jahaan donon partiyaan milakar bijepi ko rokane kii haalat main hai
 We are saying this because SP and BSP came in second and third positions in 62 seats out of the total 80 seats in UP and this figure comes out after adding their total vote percentage
 ye aankade bataate hai ki donon dalon kaa mat pratishat jodne ke baad bhi samaajawaadee party or bispi kareeb 35 siton par hi bijepi ko takkar dene kii sthiti main hai, yani in 62 siton main se 27 siten aisi hai jahaan sapa or basapa ke vot ek saath bhi ho jaaen to wo bijepi ko haraane kii haalat main nahin hai
 If the 2014 data is taken as the basis, then the alliance of Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati can snatch 35 seats from BJP to date
 isamen sapa kii jiti hui 5 siton ko jod diya jaae to ye aankada 40 tak pahunchataa he yani sapa basapa gathbandhan aaj kii taarikh main 80 main se 40 siten jeet sakati hai
 The condition of this alliance is very bad in seats like Bulandshahr, Muzaffarpur, Agra, Hathras and Faizabad
 yahaan bijepi kii jeet kaa antar donon ke sanyukt voton ke antar se zyada he
 The same SP BSP alliance can benefit in Basti, Sambhal, Hardoi, Nagina, Lalganj and Ghazipur seats where there is a difference of about 20 per cent between the combined votes of both the parties and the bjp's vote percentage, which means an increased threat to the BJP in these seats
 Is hovering congress ko gathbandhan main shaamil na karke sapa or basapa ne aapas main 75 siten baant lee hai
 At the same time, the coalition has now decided that they will not field candidates in Amethi, the seat of Congress President Rahul Gandhi and Rae Bareli seat of UPA Chairperson Sonia Gandhi
 ham aapako bataa den ki 2014 main basapa ek bhi seat jeetne main kaamyaab nahin ho pai thi jabaki 34 siton par wo number 2 par thi
 At the same time, Samajwadi Party reached second position in 31 seats and Congress in 7 seats
 2014 loksabhaa chunaav ke upi ke ye aankade dilachasp hai, sapa basapa gathbandhan ne bijepi kii mushkilen badhaai jarur hai lekin bijepi ko phir bhi haraana aasaan nahin hoga bijepi kii sabase badi chunauti in donon partiyon ko rokna hoga to samaajawaadee party or bispi donon ke liye sabase bada chalange apane voton ko ek duusare ko transfar karana hoga

 Unhappy over the cancellation of the appointment of Krishna Saini, chairman of the Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission, Arvind Kejriwal has written a letter to the Lieutenant Governor asking LG to reconsider the entire matter and withdraw this decision for the betterment of the public
 ek lambii chitthee main arvind kejariwal ne safai dete hue likhaa he ki 'chairman kii niyukti main koi gadabadi nahin kii gayi
 In the process of appointing the chairman, the constitution of the selection committee as well as the electrical rules were taken care of
 jabaki niyamon ke mutabik niyukti se pehleuparajyapalki anumati zaruri nahin he isliye alji ko aisa koi prastaav nahin bheja gaya tha
 The chairman of the selection committee was the retired judge of the High Court while the chairman of the CERC and the chief secretary were members of the committee
 jinaki sahmati se krishna saini ko niyukt kiya gaya tha
 Meanwhile, Kejriwal in his letter also cited the decision of the High Court where LG was said to be the head of Delhi
 chitthee main likhaa he ki 'uparajyapal jaanate hai ki hycourt ke faisle ko dilli sarkaar ne supreme court main chunauti di he
 The final decision of which is expected in the beginning of November, so we should wait for the Supreme Court's decision
 uparajyapal se nivedan he ki janata kii bhalaai ke liye wo apane faisle par dobaaraa vichaar karen
 According to the letter, the order for the appointment of the selection committee and the chairman was sent to the Lieutenant Governor, but the LG did not object to it nor did the entire case file be sought back

 dilli sarkaar ne apni arji main hoicourt ko yah bhi bataaya he ki is maamle main alji se manjuuri lene ke liye file bheji ja chuki he
 In fact, the Lt Governor had on 21 September canceled the appointment of DERCK chairman as invalid
 bataaya gaya tha ki dilli sarkaar ne is niyukti main na to niyamon kaa paalan kiya or na hi niyukti ko lekar alji se pehle anumati le gai thi
 At the same time, in the decision of the High Court of August 4, it was clear that the Delhi government cannot appoint the DERC chairman in the capital Delhi without any permission from LG under any circumstances

 sanjay lila bhansaali kii film padmavati vivaadon main he
 Very few people are aware that Sanjay Leela Bhansali wanted to make this film from about 18 years ago
 iske liye us vakt unhone star cast bhi final kar lee thi, haalanki tab aisa nahin ho paaya
 For some reason, the film went into cold storage
 darasal, 1999 main salmaan khan, ajay devgan or aishwarya raay ke saath 'ham dil de chuke sanam' banane ke baad se hi bhansaali ke dimag main bajirao-mastaani or 'padmavati' kii kahani thi
 Their on and offscreen chemistry was behind the salman-ash pairing in the film
 kabhi flop nahin ho sakati deepika kii padmavati, aise rakam vasuul lenge bhansalibhunanaa chaahate the aishwarya-salmaan kii jodibhansali is jodi ke saath bajirao mastaani or padmavati kaa nirmaan karnaa chaahate the
 If sources are to be believed, it was Bhansali's attempt to recreate the magic of Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam once again on the silver screen
 haalanki aisa ho nahin paaya
 According to the information, Aishwarya Rai was to play the role of Rani Padmavati while Salman Khan was being given the role of Alauddin Khilji
 baad main salmaan or aish kaa brallep ho gaya
 The relationship of the two is also not such that they do films together
 haalanki brallep ke baad bhi bhansaali ne unhen 'padmavati' approach kii, par baat nahin bani
 However, Aishwarya agreed to play Padmavati and wanted Salman Khan to play Alauddin
 darasal, aish kii koshish thi ki wo brallep ke baad salmaan ke saath screen na share karen
 But Bhansali's plan was destroyed
 salmaan, allaudin khilji ke role ke liye raji hi nahin hue
 Bhansali put his project on hold due to lack of a desired star cast
 18 saal baad kyon bhansaali ne banaai padmavati?darasal, deepika or ranvir singh ke saath 'goliyon kii raasalila ramlila' jaisi block baster film banane ke baad bhansaali ne is jodi ko lekar 2015 main aitihaasik kahani bajirao mastaani banaai
 The duo did wonders at the box office
 aitihaasik formula hit hone ke saath 18 saal baad bhansaali ko padmavati ke liye manamafik star cast mil gai thi
 He decided to make a film
 haalanki padmavati kii ghoshnaa ke saath hi unhen lagaataar vivaad bhi shuru ho gaye
 Uproar over Padmavati, 24-hour police watch outside Bhansali's office will be released in december
the film Padmavati will be released in theaters on December 1
 ab salmaan khan vaale role ko ranvir singh kar rahe hai
 While Deepika Padukone is going to be seen in the role of Rani Padmavati
 raja ratan singh ke kirdaar main shahid kapur hai

 Pakistan can be placed in the dark gray list Pakistan is about to hand over to the FATF
 The Dossier Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is to decide on Pakistan on October 18, but before that it does not see the support of any country
 jaankaree ke mutabik, pakistan ko dark grey list main rakhaa ja saktaa he
 The report says that Pakistan is about to hand over a dossier to the FATF to take action against terrorism

 bataa den, china ke jiyangmin lu kii adhyakshata main efeetief kaa yah pehla adhiveshan he
 The decision on terrorist funding is to be decided on the funding to be given to Pakistan in the name of action against terrorism soon
 agar faisla pakistan ke khilaaf gaya to imran khan kii ummiido ko sabase bada jhatka lagegaa
 If the FATF feels that Pakistan has been lax in the steps it has been asked to take by October, then it can put Pakistan in the 'black list'
 iskaa matlab yah hoga ki use imef auravishwa bankjaise antarrashtriya vittiya sansthaanon se karj or sahaayta nahin mil sakegi
 Let me tell, Pakistan is currently in the 'gray list' (watch list) and it is trying to come out of it
 efeetief ne mani londring or aatanki funding ke khilaaf karrwai puri karne ke liye use oktober tak kaa samay diya he

 is pad ke liye kai dal apni daavedaari pesh kar rahe hai jinamein sarkaar kii sahyogi shivasena se lekar wiesarsipi or bijedy jaise vipakshi dal bhi shaamil hai
 It has generally been a tradition to give this post to an opposition party and following this, the last time the AIADMK was given this post
 sutron ke mutabik jagah mohan reddy kii party ko dipti spikar kaa pad ofer kiya gaya he lekin YSRCP ne is pad ko lene se pehle ek shart laga di he
 The party says that it does not want to stand with the government by taking the post of deputy speaker
 jagan kii party ne saaf kiya he ki jab tak andhra pradesh ko vishesh rajya kaa darja nahin diya jaataa tab tak vah sattadhari dal ke saath nahin khadey honge
 However, the party has also talked about creating an equal distance from the opposition parties

 For this reason, Andhra's party TDP was ousted from the previous government

 Now if the YSRC remains adamant on this demand then there is bound to be an uproar in Parliament again

 Even though Naveen Patnaik's party seems to be standing by the decisions of the BJD central government, there is a conflict of interest of BJP-BJD in the state
 soobe main bijepi apane pair pasaarne main lagi he or bijedy ko vahaan apana kila bachaana he
 In such a situation, BJP will not want to stand with the party in Odisha and stand with them in Delhi

 khabar he ki sagaai ke maukey par jab donon ne anguuthiyaan badalin to deepika imotional ho gayi
 His eyes became moist and seeing this view all the guests present there became emotional
 donon 2 alag-alag reeti rivaajon se shaadi kar rahe hai kyonki ranvir sindhi hai or deepika konkani
 Ranveer and Deepika came close to each other in Sanjay Leela Bhansali's film Goliyon Ki Rasleela - Ramleela
 is film kii shooting ke dauraan hi donon kii dosti ek paaydaan or aage bad gai
 The two started meeting each other constantly
 kaaphi vakt tak donon is rishte ko media se chhipate rahe, lekin ek vakt ke baad donon ne iskaa khulaasa kar diya
 Festive season is underway
 diwali kaa tyohaar aa chukaa he
 Diwali is everywhere
 diwali aate hi partiyon kaa silsilaa bhi shuru ho jaataa he
 Diwali parties have started in Bollywood too
 shahrukh khan or shilpa shetty donon ne apane industry ke doston ke liye party kaa aayojan kiya
 By the way, any festival in India seems incomplete without songs
 bollywood filmon ke aise kai song hai, jo diwali ko kaaphi special banaate hai
 Let's look at the top 8 songs of Bollywood, which can be doubled by celebrating Diwali
 ham jin gaanon ko bataa rahe hai unhen internet yaa duusare tamaam maadhyam par suna ja saktaa he
 You may also have this collection
 ham jin gaanon kaa suzav de rahe hai iname se kuch theme diwali he, jabaki kai duusare gane party theme par banaae gaye hai
 Song- Sometimes Khushi Sometimes Gumfilm- Sometimes Khushi Kabhi Gumfilm: Sai Babasong of Shirdi: Diwali Celebrated suhanifilm: Devdasong: Silsila Yeh Chahta Kaafilm- Paigamsong- How Diwali celebratedaparty Songfilm: Badrinath Ki Dulhangaap Tumam : Satyamev Jayatesong: Dilberfilm: Namaste Englandsong: Proper Patola salmaan khan kii film 'tubalite' ko 21
 15 crore opening has been received
 'tubalite' ne bhartiya box offis par pehle din 21
 Have done a business of 15 crores
 haalanki yah opening kaaphi acchhee he magar salmaan khan kii pichhali film ne box offis par jis tarah kaa collection kiya tha us hisaab se ye opening kuch khaas nahin he
 Also, before the release of this film, tremendous earnings were being expected from it, but the earnings on the first day could not reach that expectation
 yaad dilaa den ki aamir khan kii film 'dangal' aise samay par relies hui thi jab desh notebndi ke daur se guzar rahaa tha
 In that period 'dangal' on the first day 29
 78 karod kaa kaarobaar kiya tha
 36 to the 'sultan' of Salman itself
 54 karod kii opening mili thi
 Sultan had the advantage that the film was released on holiday on the day of Eid
 idhar 'tubalite' bina kisi chuttee ke relies hui he phir bhi fark bada he
 The film 'tubelight' has not received a good response from critics
 yahaan tak kii salmaan khan ke phens kii pratikriya bhi is film ko lekar mili juli hi he
 Some viewers have considered this film to be slow, while some have rejected it as an emotional story
 salmaan khan bhi is film ko apni pichhali filmon se alag maanate hai
 However, Salman has not been disappointed with the mixed response to his film
 unhone apane brands beeing human or piviar ke ek event par kaha, 'mujhe samikshakon se or kam number milane kii ummid thi phir bhi kuch samikshakon ek yaa dedh number de die
 'tubelight' is not a film where you make noise or have fun with friends
 ye ek imotional karne vaali kahani he
 ' apni film ke bare main baat karte hue salmaan khan ne kaha ki 'tubalite' ek imotional drama he jo puure parivaar ke saath dekha ja saktaa he
 It is evident that when Salman himself believes that there is not much spice in the tubelight, then opening 21
 15 bhi kaaphi he or unke staradam kaa fal he kyonki darshak salmaan se masala or manoranjak film kii ummid karte hai
 The relief for 'tubelight' is that there will be a 3-day weekend as well as Eid holiday and after Eid, there will be a crowd of viewers who do not watch the film during Ramadan
 film 'tubalite' ko samikshakon se acchhee pratikriya nahin mili he
 Even the response of Salman Khan's fans is mixed with this film
 kuch darshakon ne is film ko dhimi mana he to kisi ne jajbaati kahani kahkar nakaar diya he
 Salman Khan also considers this film different from his previous films
 haalanki salmaan ko apni film ko mili is milijule rispons se niraash nahin hui he
 On an event by his brand Being Human and PVR, he said, 'I expected to get fewer numbers from critics, yet some reviewers gave one or one and a half numbers

 Apart from Mission Mangal, he is working in films like Akshay, Good News, Suryavanshi, Housefull 4
 goa main varisht patrakaron se baat karte hue manohar parrikar ne ek baar kaha tha ki ve rajya ke pehle mukhyamantri dayanand bandodkar kii tarah hona chaahate hai
 Looking back, his words sound like prophecy, as Parrikar, like Bandodkar, gave up his life while still in the post of Chief Minister
 bandodkar goa ke aise pehle siyasatdan bhi the, jinaki antyeshti main 1973 main 1,00,000 se zyada log shaamil hue the
 On March 18, people also gathered to bid farewell to Parrikar
 bhaajapa netaa kaa antim sanskaar rajya kii rajdhani panaji ke bahari chor par sthit miramar bich par bane unke idal ke smarak ke najadik kiya gaya
 But will the BJP in Goa have the same fate as Bandodkar's Maharashtra Gomantak Party (MGP) after his death? The MGP, once highly influential, ruled for more than a decade before the BJP emerged in Goa
 aaj vidhansabha main is party kii takat mahat teen vidhayakon tak simatakar rah gai he
 In Goa, the BJP has been struggling with an identity crisis for the last two-one years
 ek ke baad ek mahabhulon ke baad isaki lokapriyata or janaadhar main khaasi giravat ai he
 The infighting in the party is at its peak
 parrikar ke jane ke baad ab party main aisa koi nahin he jo use ekajute rakh sake
 How desperate and desperate the BJP is, it is also evident from the fact that Pramod Sawant got 1 on the night of March 18 and 19
 45 baje nae mukhyamantri kii shapath dilaavai gai
 Two posts of Deputy Chief Minister were also created to gain the support of Sudin Dhavalikar of MGP and Vijay Sardesai of Goa Forward Party (GFP)
 dhawalikar mukhyamantri ke ohade ke liye jid kar rahe the or tab kahin jaakar daud se hate jab emjeepi ke teen main se do vidhayakon—babu ajaganvkar or deepak pavaskar— ne gatirodh todgaye ke liye bhaajapa main shaamil hone kii peshkash kar di
 Desperate to choose a loyalist, the BJP chose Banisbatan Natjubarkar and the second time MLA Sawant
 yahaan tak ki neelesh kabraal or vishwajit rane sareekhe tape-tapaae netaaon ke upar unhen tarjeeh di gai, kyonki anbhavi hone ke baavjood in netaaon kii vafadari par haal ke dinon main sawalia nishaan lage the
 Sawant, 46, is an Ayurveda doctor by profession and was known as Parrikar's right hand
 ve sanquelim se vidhayak hai or rashtriya swayamsevak se jude rahe hai, jiskaa puraa samarthan unhen hasil he
 As the chairman of the Goa State Industrial Development Corporation, he had initiated several infrastructure projects, including the first floating jetty of Hindustan in Old Goa, which also caught Parrikar's attention, in addition to environmentally friendly government occupants
 
 pehali chunauti jo saavant ke munhabaae khadi he, vah sarkaar kaa sucharu kaamkaaj behaal karnaa or donon upmukhyamantriyon kii mahatvakanksha par lagaam lagaana hogi
 Four of the remaining nine ministers are Sardesai's confidants, which will help them get their say in the cabinet
 parrikar kii tarah saavant ko bhi saradesai ko bahut ehtiyaat se sanbhaalanaa hoga taaki sarkaar ke bheetar takaraavon se bachaa ja sake
 Sawant's second challenge is to restore iron ore excavation in the state
 7 farvari ko supreme court ne 88 khadaanon kii lij radd kar di thi
 After that, iron ore mining has been stopped since March 16, 2018
 isse na keval rajya ke rajasav par asar padaa he, balki sarkari afasaron or audyogic sanghathanon kaa kahana he ki in khadaanon par nirbhar koi 2,00,000 log berozegaar hai
 Sawant's immediate challenge on the political front will be to win two Lok Sabha and three Assembly seats in the state, for which votes will be cast on 23 April
 isaki shuruyaat ve emjeepi ko manaane kii koshish se kar sakate hai ki vah teen vidhansabha siton—mandrem, mapusa or shiroda—se bhaajapa ke khilaaf chunaav lard rahe apane ummidavaar hataa le
 Maratha Sawant by caste will also have to demonstrate inclusive leadership
 bhaajapa ke mul voter yani anya pichde darkinar kar diya gaya mahasoos kar rahe hai
 Shripad Nayak, the tallest leader of the community, was made to wait 15 minutes at the gate of the resort on 18 March, where his fellow minister Nitin Gadkari was negotiating with the alliance parties
 bhaajapa ke ek bade netaa yah bhi maanate hai ki parrikar kii maut ke baad catholic party se chhitak jaaenge
 He says, "he was the force to connect them with the party
" unki gairmaujuudagi main catholicon kaa samarthan banaae rakhana hamaare liye mushkil ho saktaa he
 However, BJP state president Vinay Tendulkar claims that there will be no impact of Catholic votes on the party
 unhone kaha, ''ham hindu voton ke dam par achche-se chunaav jitate aa rahe hai
 Parrikar's straightforward living and uninteresting conversation had created many of his wishes
 college kii duusare saal kii chaatra aarti desai antim darshan ke liye kala academy ai thim, jahaan parrikar kaa shav rakhaa gaya tha
 She says, "I always wanted to see him but could never meet him
" ab unki aakhri jhalak paane ke liye main yahaan ai hum
 Parrikar was more or less an icon
 sochakar hairaani hoti he ki bhaajapa unki viraasat ko aage le ja paaegi yaa nahin
 Shraddhanjalimnohar Parrikar1955-2019 The late Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw once expressed regret that Hindustani politics, especially the politics headed by the Ministry of Defense, cannot differentiate between mortars and motors, guerrillas and gorillas and guns and howitzers

 One of his biggest successes was to approve the same pension for One Rank, One Pension, ie retired soldiers without taking care of the date of their retirement, which is now beaten as a milestone of NDA-II
 2015 main unhone hisaab lagaaya ki is par har saal 7,000 karod ru
 And then put full emphasis on its implementation, even though the bureaucracy and many of his fellow ministers did not want to let this happen
 unhone javaanon ke liye barason se lalaphite kii jakadaaa main fanse hemelet or bullate-pruf jacket fouran kharidne par bhi jor diya or kharidwakar hi maane

 Parrikar reluctantly came to room number 104 in South Block
 2014 main peshkash ke chah maheene baad unhone yah ohada sweekaar kiya tha
 He once told his colleagues that he likes to be a big fish in a small pond
 chote-chote raksha udhyamiyon ke ek jamaavade ko unhone choti machhlee se judaa ek or kissa sunaaya tha
 In the 1990s, a contract by DRDO (defense Research and Development Organization) for a project to build tanks for the bridge went out of the hands of Parrikar's Goa-based hydraulic parts manufacturing factory, after that design was approved
 
 unhen yakeen tha ki desh ko apane urja sapanom ko puraa karnaa he to swadeshi raksha udyog ko khadaa karnaa behad jaruri he
 His tenure in the Ministry of Defense was very short — it was the second shortest term in 20 years after Pranab Mukherjee's 17-month tenure at upa-one — but he quickly struck a balance between emphasizing Swadeshi with essential defense purchases
 And insisted on changing things in the ministry
 parrikar kii uplabdhiyon main swadeshi halke ladaaku vimaan 'tejas' kii pariyojna ko jilane main madad dena bhi he
 Unhappy with its Mark 1 aircraft, he persuaded the Air Force to tentatively approve orders for 83 Mark 1A aircraft

 Under normal circumstances, according to the Ministry of Defense terminology, a 'resultant single vendor' (as a result single vendor) would have canceled the deal and had to be re-tendered, leading to many years of delay
 magar parrikar ne saude par jor diya
 He argued that 'merit cannot be punished'

 World chess champion Vishwanathan Anand said that in many difficult circumstances, only talent does not work, and luck is also needed to win big tournaments
 tippaniyan Anand said that in times of odd circumstances, he plays tricks based on his instincts and experience and he gives victory
 unhone eniaiti ke sammaan samaaroh main kaha, ‘kai baar koi choti chaal bhi badi ban jaati he
 In many circumstances my instincts and guesses are correct
 lekin yah manovaigyanik kaaryon ke niyamit abhyaas par nirbhar karata he
 ' anand ne 2000 main alexandra khalifeman ke khilaaf match kaa zikr karte hue kaha, kai baar aise toornament main bhi jabaki aap apni sarvshereshth shatranj khel rahe ho tab bhi aapako ishwar kii madad kii jarurat padati he
 You need a little luck
 unhone kaha, kai baar aapako jarurat padati he ki kuch aapke paksh main ho jaae
 Then you think that only talent is not everything but it is not something that happens often
 anand ne kaha ki kai baar visham paristhitiyon main vah apane sahaj gyaan or anubhav ke aadhaar par chaal chalate hai or vah jeet dilaa detii he
 He said at the honor ceremony of NIIT, 'sometimes even a small trick becomes big
 kai paristhitiyon main meraa sahaj gyaan or anumaan sahi ho jaataa he
 But it depends on the regular practice of psychological tasks
 ’ Referring to the match against Alexander Khalifman in 2000, Anand said, "even in such a tournament when you are playing your best chess, you still need God's help
" aapako thodaa bhagya kii jarurat hoti he
 He said, sometimes you need something to be in your favor

 Minor differences between husband and wife can also be fatal, this is a hallmark seen in the capital Delhi
 dilli main ek pati ne apni patni ko mahaj isliye balakani se neeche phenk diya kyonki wo uske aaraam main khalal paidaa kar rahi thi
 The woman died in this accident
 police ne aaropee pati ke khilaaf maamla darj kar liya
 The incident is from Khichadipur area of east Delhi
 mritak mahila kaa naam lalita tha
 In fact, on the night of 20 August, 45-year-old Lalita was at home with both her daughters
 ghatana ke samay unki donon betiyaan or damaad ghar par nahin the
 Let me tell you that Lalitha had been in conflict with her husband for a long time
 raat takreeban 8 baje lalita kaa pati dalip ghar aayaa
 Dalip wanted to rest at home but Lalita disturbed Dalip's comfort
 is baat par donon main kaaphi der takajhagadahua
 After getting angry, Dalip threw Lalita down from the 25-foot-high balcony
 mahila ko sadak par gira dekh log ikattha ho gaye
 Some people rushed Lalita to the hospital in a hurry

 The Bharatiya Janata Party had to issue a final list of candidates on the last day of nomination due to protests and rebellion over ticket distribution in the Gujarat assembly elections
 is list main 34 pratyaashiyon kii ghoshnaa kii gai, lekin purv mukhyamantri anandiben patel kaa naam kahin najar nahin aayaa
 Bhatendra Patel was given a ticket from the Ghatlodiya seat where she was an MLA
 jiske baad sawaal uth rahe hai ki bijepi ke ummidavaaron kii list se sitting vidhayak or purv siem kaa patta kyon kaata gaya?bijepi netritv ke is faisle ko samajha jaae to ek taraf gujarat ke purv mukhyamantri keshubhai patel kii yaad aati he, vahiin duusari ore bijepi kii taraf se ye sabit karne kii koshish najar aati he ki aarakshan ke liye andolnarat patidaaron ke virodh ke baavjood wo majboot sthiti main he
 When Keshubhai was not found in 2002, when the curfew was imposed on the reservation movement of ticket holders after the ruckus in Gujarat, this silence was discussed in the whole country
 patidaaron kaa andolan hinsa main badal gaya
 Firing, sabotage and arson were seen
 maut huin, log ghayal hue, noujvaan jail gaye
 All this happened when the command of the state was in the hands of Anandiben Patel
 lekin kuch vakt baad hi unhen siem kii gaddi chhodani padi
 When the earthquake hit Gujarat in 2001 , the then Chief Minister Keshubhai Patel lost his throne
 keshubhai ne sehat kaa hawala dete hue apana istipha de diya
 While allegations of failure to run the government, abuse of power and corruption were also a matter of discussion
 unki jagah narendra modi ko mukhyamantri pad kii jimmedaari di gai
 But the matter was not limited to going to the post of CM, when the assembly elections were held in 2002, BJP did not even give him a ticket
 vahiin anandiben patel ne agast 2016 main jab siem pad se istipha diya to unhone apane us faisle ke peeche umr kaa hawala diya
 After his resignation, now that assembly elections are being held in the state in 2017, he has been dismissed from electoral politics
 aisa tab hua he, jab haal hi main anandiben ne is baat ke sanket die the ki agar party kahati he to vah chunaav ladane par vichaar kar sakati hai
 Talking to Aaj Tak, Anandiben had said that if the party offers them such a proposal, they will consider it
 yahaan tak ki wo ye bhi kah chuki hai ki ghatlodia seat ho yaa koi or, is baat kaa faislaparty netritv or pratinidhimandalhi karegaa ki koun kahaan se chunaav ladega
 On Monday, from the party headquarters in Delhi's Ashoka Road, where Amit Shah decides on the politics of the entire country, the party leadership has decided whether the Anandiben Patel Ghatlodia seat will not contest any of the 182 seats
 2001 main bhi bijepi ne apane sabase kaddavar patel netaa or purv siem ko chunavi raajnneeti se bedakhal kar diya, vahiin ab 2017 main thik usee andaaj gujarat kii varisht petal netaa or purv siem ko vidhansabha chunaav na ladaane kaa faisla kiya gaya he
 The message of strength even without the Patels is that their 'patel' is also seen as a reason behind not getting tickets for Anandiben
 bhale hi anandiben ke kaarykaal main aarakshan kii maang kar rahe patelon par police ne laathiyaan barasaai hon, lekin unhen tikat na dena party kii taraf se ek bada sandesh samajha ja rahaa he
 In fact, the Patel community in Gujarat has been the bjp's traditional vote
 lekin 2015 se hardik patel ke netritv main shuru hua patidaaron kaa andolan bijepi se duuri kaa sabab banataa gaya
 The situation became such that the Patidars started speaking openly against Narendra Modi and Amit Shah
 bijepi ko haraane kii chetavanee dene lage
 Even BJP leaders started showing black flags during campaigning, throwing chairs in their meetings
 ant main ye hua ki patidaaron ne congress ko samarthan kaa elaan kar diya
 In such a situation, given the political equations in place of Gujarat, this possibility is being raised, the opposition of the Patidars, who has been in power in Gujarat for almost two decades, is taking backfoot
 congress bhi patidaar or obisi netaa alpesh thakor ke samarthan or dalit netaa jignesh mewaani ke bijepi virodh se khud ko majboot sthiti main aank rahi he
 In such a situation, the BJP has also tried to convey the message of being confident of its strong position despite its victory and opposition from the Patels by not giving tickets to the Patel leader and former Chief Minister of his party

 In the context of recent disclosure of tapes of corporate public relations officer Neera Radia's conversations with politicians and journalists, Shourie said that there is no doubt that a tape shows that someone has replaced Venkaiah Naidu In the discussion held in Parliament on the budget in the year 2009, arrangements were made to become the main speaker of the party

 He said, 'this happened because i had unfavorable remarks at a party meeting about a particular proposal
 mere kehane kaa yah matlab he ki unhen is bare main kaise maaloom chalaa
 He came to know about it in some way and it was certainly his apprehension
 main is bare main sadan main kuch kah bhi saktaa tha or nahin bhi
