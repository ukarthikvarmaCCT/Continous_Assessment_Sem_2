 At the same time, people who like to spend time alone, are given the tag of anti-social
 lekin haal hi main hui study main ek chaunkaane vaali baat saamne ai he
 According to the study report, if you give more importance to a good book by staying at your house instead of partying late at night, then it is your identity to be intelligent
 singapore management uniwarsity or landan skool of iconomics ke shodhakartaaon ke mutabik, intellegent log ghoomane ke bajaae khud ke saath time spend karne ko zyada ahmiyat dete hai
 In this study, the researchers included more than 15,000 people aged between 18 and 28
 isamen shodhakartaaon ne ye jaanane kii koshish ki aakhir ye log kitni aabaadi vaali jagahon par rahete hai or kitna apane doston ke saath ghoomte hai
 With this, researchers also found out how many people are satisfied with their lives
 nateezon main saamne aayaa ki jo log kam aabaadi vaali jagahon par rahete hai, ve duusare logon ke mukaable zyada khush hote hai
 At the same time, many of these people felt happy only when they met special people
 is study ke liye shodhakartaaon ne 'da savana theory of happines' par apane nishkarshon ko aadhaar banaaya he
 According to this theory, a person's satisfaction in life is determined not just by what is currently happening, but also by how our ancestors reacted to such a situation
 is theory ke mutabik, hamaare purvajon ko duusare logon ke saath samay bitaana kaaphi pasand tha or wo apane jivan main kisi ke saath samay bitaane ko khaas ahmiyat dete the
 In the same way in the present era too many people do not like to be alone and such people are in search of getting some company
 lekin iske vipareet psychologist kaa maananaa he ki intellegent log is baat main yakeen nahin rakhte hai
 Rather, such people are more happy in their company
 aapako bhi agar jivan main akele rahane se dar nahin lagata he or aap apni khud kii company main zyada khush rahete hai, to samaj lijie aap intellegent hai

 varisht vakil ram jethmalani ne ek baar phir daawa kiya ki wo saalon pehle landan main anderworld don daaud ibrahim se mili the
 According to Jethmalani, Dawood had told him that he wanted to return to India with some conditions, but the then Chief Minister of Maharashtra Sharad Pawar refused to accept those conditions
 ram jethmalani ne kaha he daaud ne desh lautne ke liye kuch sharten rakhi thim
 He told me "he is ready to return to the country if he is assured that a third degree will not be used against him in questioning
" sari kanoonee prakriya ke dauraan use ghar main nazarband rakhaa jayega
 i remember that i wrote a letter to Sharad Pawar in this matter
 " Jethmalani said,
 
 
 lekin tatkaaleen centre sarkaar ke alaava maharashtra sarkaar ke mukhiya sharad pavaar ne daaud kii sharton ko maanane se inkaar kar diya
 In this case, Sharad Pawar says that the proposal came, it is true, but he had laid down some conditions with dedication, we had said that this is not acceptable to us
 " tippaniyan On the other hand, the central government refused to comment on the matter
 grahamantri rajnath singh ne kaha, "bharat sarkaar ko jo karnaa he, ham kar rahe hai, ham dusron par tippanee nahin karenge"
 It is true that like any other issue in the country, every political party uses the issue of bringing Dawood back to India like an electoral jumble
 har dal daawa karata he ki sarkaar main aane ke baad wo desh ko mujrim ko desh lekar aayega, lekin har baar sivaay bhaashan ke hota kuch nahin he
 Ram Jethmalani has said that Dawood had laid some conditions for returning to the country
 usne mujhase kaha tha "wo desh lautne ke liye taiyaar he, agar use aashwast kiya jaae ki poochtacha main uske khilaaf third degree kaa istemaal nahin hoga
 He will be kept under house arrest during the entire legal process
 mujhe yaad he is maamle main maine sharad pavaar ko khat likhaa tha
 " jethmalani ne kaha, 
 
 
 But apart from the then central government, Maharashtra government chief Sharad Pawar refused to accept Dawood's terms
 is maamle main sharad pavaar kaa kahana he ki prastaav aayaa tha ye sach he, lekin usne samarpan ke saath kuch sharten rakhi thim, hamane kah diya tha ki ye hamen manzur nahin he
 "comments udhar is maamle main centre sarkaar ne koi tippanee se inkaar kar diya
 Home Minister Rajnath Singh said, "we are doing what the Government of India has to do, we will not comment on others"
 vaise ye sach he ki desh main duusare muddon kii tarah daaud ko bhi bharat waapas laane ke mudde ko har siyaasi dal chunavi jumale kii tarah istemaal karata he
 Every party claims that after coming into the government, they will bring the country to the culprit, but every time there is nothing except speech

 pichley ek hafte ke andar jammu kashmir ke elosi par pakistan kii taraf se kii gai firing main sena ke 6 jawan shahid ho chuke hai

 jammu-kashmir main raajnneetik or sainya hulchalon ke bich artical 35A ko samaapt karne kii maang ko lekar supreme court main daakhil janhit yachika par bhi charchaa tej ho gai he
 The petition filed said that Article 35A is not only the Indian Constitution but also the biggest fraud with the people of Kashmir
 supreme court main yah janhit yachika daakhil karne vaale vakil ashvini upaadhyaay kaa kahana he ki artical 35A ko samvidhan sanshodhan karne vaale anuchhed 368 main nirdhaarit prakriyaaon kaa paalan karke nahin joda gaya balki ise tab kii sarkaar ne avaidh tareeke se chipkaaya tha
 Only Parliament has the right to amend the Constitution
 artical 35A na keval artical 368 main nirdhaarit sanvaidhanik prakriyaaon kaa ulanghan karata he, balki bharat ke samvidhan kii mul sanrachana ke bhi khilaaf he
 Any article can be added or subtracted from the Constitution only as per the procedure laid down in Article 368 by the Parliament
 jabaki artical 35A ko sansad ke samaksh ajtak kabhi prastut hi nahin kiya gaya
 It is also clear from this that the constitutional amendment of Parliament under Article 368 bypassed the then Government in the case of Article 35A
 yachika main ye daleel bhi he ki artical 35A ke jariye, janm ke aadhaar par kiya gaya vargeekaran artical 14 kaa ulanghan he
 It is against the equality of every citizen before the law and the basic structure of the constitution
 artical 35A ke anusaar gaiyr-nivasee nagarikon ke paas jammu-kashmir ke sthaayee nivaasiyon ke samaan adhikaar or visheshadhikaar nahin ho sakate hai
 Article 35A violates the fundamental right of a woman by not giving her children the right to property after marrying a man of their choice
 agar koi mahila kisi aise purush se shaadi karti he jiske paas kashmir kaa sthaayee nivas pramaan patr na ho to uske bacchon ko na to sthaayee nivas pramaan patr miltaa he or na hi jayjad main hissaa
 They are not considered fit to participate in the property even if the woman has citizenship of Kashmir
 is anuchhed se un shramikon or mul nivaasiyon jaise anusuchit jati or anusuchit janajati ke logon ke moulik adhikaron ke ulanghan kii bhi khuli chhot milti he jo kai pidiyon se kashmir main nivas kar rahe hai
 Dalits and Valmikis who were brought to the state of Jammu and Kashmir between 1950-60 were given permanent residence certificates on the condition that they and their future generations can remain in the state only when they became scavengers Stay aaj rajya main chah dashak kii seva karne ke baad bhi un mailaa dhone waalon ke bachche safai karmchaaree hai or unhen koi or pesha chunane kaa adhikaar nahin he
 Due to property ownership restrictions, the industrial sector and the private sector are suffering extreme damage
 achche doctor ejeeniyar professor kashmir main nahin aate
 Children outside Kashmir do not get admission in state colleges
 yah pakistan se aae sharnaarthiyon ke adhikaron ko bhi kam karata he
 They are citizens of India but being non-permanent residents of Kashmir, they are deprived of the basic rights and privileges enjoyed by the permanent residents of Jammu and Kashmir
 yachika main upaadhyaay kii daleel he ki artical 35A rajya sarkaar ko ek anuchit aadhaar par bharat ke nagarikon ke bich bhedbhaav karne kii khuli aazaadee detaa he
 In this, preference is given to treading the rights of one and giving rights to the other
 gaiyr-nivaasiyon ko sampatti kharidne, sarkari naukari paane yaa sthaneey chunaav main vot dene se varjit kiya jaataa he
 The President of India added Article 35A to the Constitution by an executive order, although Article 370 does not provide the President with legislative powers to amend the Constitution of India
 artical 35A na keval kanoon dwaara sthapit sanvaidhanik prakriyaaon kaa ulanghan karata he, balki samvidhan ke anuchhed 14, 15, 16, 19, 21 main pradutt moulik adhikaron kaa bhi hanan karata he
 Article 35A is imposed arbitrarily
 yah samvidhan ke anuchhed 14, 15, 16, 19 or 21 main die gaye samanta, rojgaar, samaan avasar, vyapaar or vyavsaay, sanghathan banane, soochna paane, vivaah, niztaa, aashray paane, swasthya or shiksha ke mul adhikaron kaa ullaghann karata he
 It is clear from this that Article 35A is not only the Indian constitution but the biggest fraud with the people of Kashmir
 aakhir kya he artical 35a?-artical 35A se jammu kashmir sarkaar ko yah adhikaar mila he ki vah kise apana sthaayee nivasee maane or kise nahin
 Jammu and Kashmir government considers those who settled in Kashmir before 14 May 1954
 -kashmir ke sthaayee nivaasiyon ko jameen kharidne, rojgaar paane or sarkari yojanaon main vishesh adhikaar mila he
 - a resident of another state of the country cannot live as a permanent resident in Jammu and Kashmir
 -duusare rajyon ke nivasee naa kashmir main jameen kharid sakate hai, naa rajya sarkaar unhen naukari de sakati he
 If a woman from Jammu and Kashmir marries a person from another state in India, property rights of her and her children are taken away
 umr abdulla kaa nikaah gaiyr kashmiri mahila se hua he lekin unke bacchon ko saare adhikaar hasil hai
 Omar Abdullah's sister Sara Abdullah has been deprived of her right to property because she is married to a non-kashmiri
 samvidhan ke anuchhed 370 ke tahat hi joda gaya tha anuchhed 35a-anuchhed 35A kii vajah se jammu kashmir ke nagarikon ke paas dohari naagarikta he
 Article 370 causes separate flag and separate constitution in Jammu and Kashmir
 -artical 370 ke kaaran kashmir main vidhansabha kaa kaarykaal 6 saal kaa hota he, jabaki anya rajyon main 5 saal kaa hota he
 Due to Article 370, the Indian Parliament has very limited powers to make laws regarding Jammu and Kashmir
 -sansad main paas kanoon jammu kashmir main turant lagu nahin hote hai
 Right to education, right to information, anti money laundering law, anti black money law and anti corruption law are not applicable in Kashmir
 isse yahaan naa to aarakshan miltaa he, naa hi nunatam vetan kaa kanoon lagu hota he
 What is the legal aspect of this? In 2014, an NGO named We the Citizens filed an application in the Supreme Court but the Central and State governments have not filed their reply till date
 is bich chaaru khanna, ladda ram, ashvini upaadhyaay or major ramesh upaadhyaay ne bhi artical 35A ko supreme court main chailenj kiya
 a total of 6 pils are currently pending against Article 35A
 ashvini upaadhyaay ne artical 35A ke atirikt ek anya yachika daakhil kar artical 370 kii vaidhata ko bhi chunauti di he
 The petition of Vijay Laxmi Jha has also been pending in the Supreme Court since 2017 but the Central and State Government have not yet filed their reply
 sabhi yachikaaon main yah daleel di gai he ki samvidhan banaate samay kashmir ko vishesh darje kii baat nahin kii gai thi
 Even the four members of the Constituent Assembly who drafted the Constitution were from Kashmir itself
 anuchhed 370 asthaayee praavdhaan he jo halaat saamaanya hone tak ke liye banaaya gaya tha
 The framers of the Constitution never thought that Article 370 would add a provision like 35A
 artical 35A "ek vidhaan ek samvidhan ek raashtragan ek nishaan" kii bhaavana par chot karata he
 The lack of equal rights of citizens of other states in Jammu and Kashmir is against the basic spirit of the Constitution
 artical 35A kaa itihaas tasdik karata he ki ise raashtrapati ke ek aadesh se samvidhan main 1954 main joda gaya tha
 The order was issued on the advice of the then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru's cabinet
 isse do saal pehle 1952 main nehru or shaikh abdulla kaa dilli samjhauta hua tha
 Under this, there was talk of imposing Indian citizenship in the subjects of the state of Jammu and Kashmir
 lekin artical 35A ko khaas taur par kashmir ke special states ko dikhaane ke liye laayaa gaya
 It is now being argued that this Presidential Order Article 35A should be finished
 kyonki is par sansad main koi charchaa or bahes nahin hui
 Article 35A was added to the constitution by a general order without telling Parliament

 saalon baad bihar or bengal se nikalakar rail mantri kaa kaarybharpunjab ke pawan kumaar bansalko mila he

 jab bangaloru main indian premier lig (ipiel) kii boli lagane kii prakriya main ribound ke dauraan saurav ganguli kaa naam pukaara jane vaala tha, uske kuch hi kshan pehle sahaara india ke adhyaksh subrat roy ne apane bete simanto se anurodh kiya ki ve purv bhartiya captain ko pune warirs team main shaamil karne kii ek aakhri koshish kar len
 But Geoff Marsh, the coach sitting with Seemanto Roy at the table, said, 'if you do that, then spare me
 'iske kuch hi senkad baad boli lagavane vaale richard medley ne yah elaan karte hue safed cricket gend se maano ek gol daag diya ki ganguli ko koi kharidaar nahin mila, ve kolkata nite rides sahit, jise chaar saal pehle unhone filmustar shahrukh khan or baaki niveshkon ke saath bade chaav se gadha tha, das franchigiyon main se kisi kii bhi boli aakarshith kar sakane main naakaam rahe
 Ganguly, who watched the entire process on television at home, did not react to his black Sunday
 baad main unhone apni beti sanaa or uske doston ke saath basketbaal kheli or dakshin kolkata main unke ghar ke daravaaje par bheed lagaae baithe samvaadadaataaon ke baar-baar phone kol se bachane ke liye mobile band kar diya
 About 48 hours later, the discouraged Ganguly told the owner of a sports channel, 'I was not even given the formality to get me fired
 yah dukhad he, aisa nahin hona chahie tha
 this is outrageous
 ' lalit modi ne jab paise se bhari-puri lig shuru kii thi or thake-maande tavi ke liye nilaamee kaa jane-maane chehron se ladaa hua apana khaas andaaj kaa realty sho kiya tha, tab ganguli uske pratik khilaadiyon main se ek the
 And now the same Ganguly is one of the three Indian cricketers who have played at the international level, who did not find any buyers, the other two players - Wasim Jaffer and V
 aar
 V
 singh
 Worse for Ganguly was that Rahul Dravid and V
 ve
 s
 lakshmana ko chun liya gaya, jabaki ve bhi ganguli kii tarah 35 varsh se zyada ke hai
 With the completion of the two-day bidding process, it became clear that Ganguly would not play in the fourth edition of the world's richest cricket league
 12 janvari ko subrat roy ne aakhri koshish kii thi, jab unhone ganguli ko is aashay kaa prastaav fax kiya tha ki ve pune warirs team ke maalik sahaara adventure sports ke nideshak mandal main shaamil ho jaaen
 It appeared to be an attempt to get Ganguly to enter the IPL from the back door and many wondered if KKR was not making a clear promise, would it be sensible for Ganguly to accept the offer
 
 keker ke nideshak joy bhattacharya kaa kahana he, 'nirnay puri tarah peshewar tha
 Our focus is on young players
 'purv bhartiya captain bishan singh bedi isse sahamat hai, 'ganguli twanti-20 ke dabaav kaa saamana kaise kar sakate hai? ve pichley do saal se pratiyogi cricket nahin khel rahe hai
 'anil Kumble, who is playing the main decision-maker on behalf of Royal Challengers Bangalore, also supported the talk of the veteran spinner,' This is the new reality of modern cricket
 frenchiji teen saal kaa vichaar kar rahe hai
 Not a year old
 'keker ke maalik shahrukh khan ne, jo boli shuru hone ke ek din pehle hi udaan se dakshin africa ravaanaa ho gaye the, durban main patrakaron se sirf itnaa kaha ki ve lautne ke baad ganguli se mulaakaat karenge, taaki kolkata main tanaav kam kiya ja sake, jahaan ganguli ke prashansakon ne keker ke maichon kaa bahishkaar karne kii dhamkee di he
 Ganguly's supporters argue that the former Indian captain has contributed heavily to kkr's brand value, but the owners' perception of professional management contradicts this
 kya keker akelaa aisa frenchiji nahin tha, jiske maalikon main se koi bhi boli lagaate samay nahin tha?phir bhi kayaas lagaae jate rahe ki har kisi ne ganguli kii andekhi kyon kar di
 Members of some IPL teams confirm that the former Indian captain's involvement in back-to-back politics often caused serious problems, both inside and outside the field
 keker ke ek sutara kaa kahana he ki, 'dressing room main baitaane ke lihaaj se ve khatarnaak shaks hai, ve hameshaa ek khilaadi ko duusare ke khilaaf bhadakaate rahete the or aisi taangkhinchaai karnaa unke liye aam baat thi
 'they also say,' Age was never an issue behind not including them
 mudda unki aadaton, unke swabhaav kaa he
 Everyone in Indian cricket knows the habit of doing politics from their dressing room
 ' ganguli or anya khilaadiyon ke bich aise tanaav kii ghatnaayen ipiel ke pichley sanskarnon ke dauraan ho chuki hai, jab shahrukh khan ko ganguli ko hataakar newjiland ke brandan makalam ko apni team kaa captain bananaa padaa
 Apart from this, there are some reasons
 keker kaa abhinn hissaa hone ke baavjood ganguli ipiel 4 kii yojana banaae jane ke bhi kai maheene pehle se pune warirs main sambhavit palabdal ke bare main baatcheet shuru kar chuke the
 Says Bhattacharya, "kkr's actors were telling him that they would like him to play the role of a groomer and a mentor, but they would not be able to play
" ganguli ne is peshkash kaa koi jawaab nahin diya
 Soon after the weekend's bid, KKR CEO Venky Mysore said, "this is an offer that they have to consider and if they show interest in it, it would be no pleasure for me
" 
 ' ruthe ganguli ne iskaa koi uttar nahin diya
 The case for the Pune Warriors was even more complicated

 It is believed that the coach was also shocked that Ganguly suddenly increased his fees by 1
 86 karod ru
 Had done it
 keechad oochhaalane ke is yuddh main sahaara samooh bhi bilkul tatasth bana rahaa, jise ganguli abhi haal tak apana sabase surakshit ghar samajhate the
 Abhijeet Sarkar of this Lucknow-based group says, "when the head coach and the junior players are completely against him, how can we take him?" a coach is the most appropriate person to choose a team
 'sarkaar kii baat par kisi ko aitraaj nahin he
 The fourth bid cleared all confusion about the game and the business
 boli ke liye pesh hue kisi bhi jane-maane khilaadi se judaa rahaa koi bhi bhaavnaatmak bhav boli shuru hone ke baad ek ghante ke andar hi dub gaya
 The realization was growing that it was safer to put money on Indian players than foreigners

 66 crores Rs
 ) or rohit sharma 20 lakh dollar (9
 20 crores Rs
 ) honge
 The remaining three — Yuvraj Singh, Irfan Pathan and Saurabh Tiwari — are also not far from the $ 2 million mark

 What is the crime of being Kashmiri? This question may have come to the mind of those Kashmiri who sell dry fruits on the streets of Lucknow, who became victims of the bullying of two political goons
 haalanki ek shaks kii pahal par kuch logon ne dakhal dekar unhen bachaa liya
 An accused made the video of the incident viral
 to duusari taraf usee video se us shaks kaa cheharaa bhi saamne aayaa, jisaki pahal par kashmiri batch paae
 Lucknow, the capital of UP
 daliganj pul kii sadak par dry fruits bech rahe do kashmiri
 Two political goons beating them
 hameshaa kii tarah tamaasha dekhati bheed
 a few people make videos from mobile
 bhagava kurte pahane do gunde apane haanthon main danda lekar sadak par baithe kashmiriyon ko dhamka rahe the
 Were abusing danda se maar rahe the
 Was slapping
 unhen patharbaj kah rahe the
 Then a person from Lucknow reached there and stopped both the goons and asked? Why are you killing these men? gunde ne danda laharaate hue kaha- ye patharbaj hai
 That person responded - Why do you take the law in hand
 jo bhi ho police ko bulaao
 At that person's initiative, some more people started speaking
 tab jaakar kashmiri bache
 The name of that person is Zafar Rizvi
 unhen nahin maaloom tha ki peetane vaala koun he or pitane vaala koun
 He just jumped into this as a human being
 kashmiri batch gaye
 The video of the incident went viral
 ek aaropee gunda pakadaa gaya
 Who is a professional criminal
 ye wo asaamaajik tatv hai, jo hilite hone yaa bade netaaon kii najar main aane ke liye is tarah kii karatuuton ko anjaam dene main yakeen rakhte hai
 But with the same video going viral, Zafar Rizvi became a hero
 rizvi jaise aam log hi wo log hai, jo loktantr or insaaniyat ko bachaane main achaanak hero ban jate hai
 They raise their voice against the injustice done on the road not for any purpose or benefit but for humanity
 yaa raah chalate tamaasha dekhne ke bajaay julm karne vaale ko rokane kaa madda rakhte hai
 Where does that power come from such people? darasal, wo takat unhen bharat kaa samvidhan detaa he
 Our democracy gives
 jo sabko barabari kaa darja detaa he
 Allows everyone to earn a living by hard work and honesty
 jo aapako adhikaar detaa he ki aap anyaay ke khilaaf awaz uthaaen
 Question for your rights
 jati dharm ko jane bina kisi garib majaloom par hone vaale julm ko roke
 Zafar Rizvi of Lucknow did the same
 aisa bhi nahin ki is ghatana or uskaa video viral hone ke baad zafer rizvi tivi par aane kii khwaahish rakhte hon
 Or want to flash your name and photo
 maamla iske bilkul ulat he
 They themselves do not want to be highlighted about this
 isaki jhalak unke fasebuk acount se milti he
 Many people tagged him with that viral video on Facebook
 iske baad jafar ne ek post main likhaa ki jitna hero aap bana rahe hai, utana bada kaam kiya nahin he
 Earlier, he wrote a Facebook post
 jisamen unhone likhaa ki hero banaaie mat, khud banie
 Only then will something happen
 is post ko likhane se pehle unhone likhaa tha ki jin sahab ne ghatana kaa video banaaya unka puraa sarpot tha ham donon ko
 That means the victim and them too
 logon kii tanging, massej or shaayad fasebuk kol se jafar itane pareshaan bhi hue ki unhone apni duusari post share karte hue dhamkee de daali ki agar unhen zyada pareshaan kiya gaya to ve apana fasebuk acanut delit kar denge
 After the video of the incident went viral, Zafar Rizvi wrote clearly in his first post that he is not a hero
 agar zafer yaa koi or un 2 gundon ko nahin roktaa to maamla bad bhi saktaa tha
 Perhaps the news would have been different and this news would not have been written magar yahaan baat sirf ye samajhane kii he ki mob linching, choti-choti baton par jaan lene or asahansheeltaa ke is daur main zafer kii awaz or unase judi khabar raahat dene vaali he
 Like Zafar, your voice can also save someone's life
 zafer rizvi jaise log hi bhartiya loktantr ke wo asli nayak hai, jo sadak par chalane vaale har aam aadmi ke liye ek misaal ban jate hai

 Subbarao said today, perhaps there is a need to cut CRR and SLR
 isse pehle subbarao ne nakad arakshit anupaat (siaraar) or esaelaar main katautee karne kii bainkon kii maang se asahmati jataai thi
 The comments arabiai governor ne yahaan vaarshik banking sammelan ‘fibac summit’ ke dauraan kaha, main yah baat samajhataa hum ki isaki maang he or inamen (siaraar va esaelaar) or katautee karne kii jarurat he
 Subbarao will retire on September 4 after completing a five-year term and will be replaced by the new Governor Raghuram Rajan
 vartmaan main siaraar 4 pratishat par he, jabaki esaelaar 23 pratishat he
 State Bank of India President Pratip Chaudhary said sometime back that CRR is 'sound money'
 unhone kaha tha ki yadi arabiai ise kam nahin karata he to kam se kam iske tahat jamaa dhan par byaaj to diya hi janaa chahie
 "I understand that there is a demand and there is a need to cut further (CRR and SLR)," the RBI governor said during the annual banking conference 'fibac Summit' here
 paanch saal kaa kaarykaal puraa kar subbarao 4 sitambar ko sevanivrutt ho jaaenge or unki jagah nae governor raghuram rajan lenge
 The CRR currently stands at 4 percent, while the SLR is at 23 percent

 punjab ke kisaan in dinon dahakati hadabadi main hai
 They have to clear paddy straw from their fields so that they can prepare the fields for sowing of rabi crops
 is kaam main ve ab thodi bhi deree ganvaara nahin kar sakate—sardiyon ne dastak de di he or ab unhen apane kheton ko jotna hi hoga
 Their fields — which account for 3 percent of the country's total land — grow 19 percent of the country's wheat and 12 percent of the paddy
 haalanki kai log in kisaanon ke taur-tareekon kii aalochana karte hai—paraali jalaane se pradooshan beshak hota hi he or ilaake kii hawa ko dhundh or dhuen se bhar detaa he—magar isse desh kii khaadya aapurti main unka yogadan nahin badal jaataa
 Each hectare of fertile farms in Punjab contributes about 53 quintals of wheat and about 45 quintals of rice
 haalanki rajya kii kuch pattiyon main kapaas, ganna or makka sareekhee nakad fasalein ugaai jaati hai
 But these crops are only about 15 percent of the total agricultural yield of the state

 Cotton growing fields 2
 38 lakh hectare se badhkar is saal 4 lakh hectare se zyada ho gaye
 The main reason for this increase in yields was the increase in the minimum support price (MSP), which was Rs 4,220 in 2017-18

 krishi rajya hone ke naate punjab ko apane bhubhag main kai nadiyon—khaas taur par satluj, beas or ravi—or inase nikaali gai kai naharon ke bahane kaa saubhaahgya praapt he
 Yet a large part of the mainland is still dependent on underground water from which diesel and electric pumps are used for irrigation
 yaheen ek badi chunauti rajya ke saamne darpesh he
 The paddy crop requires 5,000 liters of water per kilogram, which depends on the continuous supply of electricity
 punjab un kuchhek rajyon main se he jo ab bhi kheton ko muft bijli dete hai
 This ultimately increases the cost to the state government — about 1 per hectare per state according to RBI data
 5 lakh rupye kharch karata he
 This does not include the recent announcement of giving assurance of crop and income under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana
 sarkari aankadon se alabatta yah bhi pataa chalata he ki punjab kaa ausat kisaan karj se dabaa he
 a recent NITI Aayog report states that about 2 above the state's average rural household
 12 lakh rupye kaa karj he, jo desh main sabase zyada he
 This is also evident from the fact that in 2017, Amarinder Singh's government came to power with pomp, promising loan waiver from farmers
 acchhee baat yah he ki krishi main rajya kii tarakkee ke saath agar koi kasar thi to vah buniyadi dhaanche main sudhaar ne puri kar di he
 All the villages of the state are now connected by asphalt roads and the state highways have seen tremendous improvement during the last few years
 arabiai ke aankadon ke mutabik, punjab ke kul bhubhag ke saath rajmargon ke network kii lambaai kaa anupaat 0
 1 km per sq km and about 84 vehicles pass through this area daily
 yah desh main kisi bhi rajya ke sabase behtareen aankadon main se ek he
 Also, Punjab was one of the first states to provide electricity to all its households
 vahiin, rashtriya swasthya surveykshan bataata he ki yahaan takreeban sabhi ghar-parivaar behatar peyajal pahunchane kii vyavastha se jud gaye hai
 The state already has two international airports - one in Chandigarh and the other in Amritsar
 naagarik uddyan mantralay udan yojana ke tahat iske chaar gharelu hawaii addon—bathinda, adampur, ludhiana or pathankot—se aane or jane vaali udaanon kii sankchaya badhaane par jor de rahaa he
 Certainly, six airports are particularly high for a state as large as Punjab
 baharhaal, 2020 tak buniyadi dhaanche kii do nai pariyojnaon kaa kaam soup die jane kii ummid he—rashtriya rajmarg-1 ke samanaantar chalane vaala or dilli ko amritsar se jodgaye vaala ek expresve or dilli ko ludhiana or dadri se jodgaye vaala ek samarpit dhulaai galiyara
 With these projects, the Amarinder government of the state hopes that better conditions will be created for the farmers and their debt burden will also be reduced

 elahabaad ke purab main varanasi kii ore jane vaale hive ke raste ganga nadi paar karte hi toun aria jhunsi pahunch jate hai
 After walking about five kilometers further, a road on the right leads to Chhatnag
 isi sadak par dayee ore 'jila aparaadh nirodhak samiti elahabaad' kaa ek board laga hua he or us par sookhti likhi he: 'aparaadh se ghrinaa karo, apradhi se nahin
 'on the other side of the road behind the same board is the three biswa land on which the war of supremacy for occupation has once again brought back the bloody gang war in Jhansi
 kabhi ret ke avaidh khanan ke liye kukhyat sangam se do kilametre dur ganga ke kinare basaa jhunsi ab jameen par kabje or jaateey sangharsh ke chalate varchasv kii jang kaa centre banakar ubhar rahaa he
 In the last two years, more than 100 cases have been taken in the form of cases, including small and big cases of land occupation and ethnic conflicts, which are the highest in other areas of Allahabad
 jhunsi main pichley ek dashak ke dauraan hue har gangvaar main aaropee rahe jhunsi ke chhatnag gaanv ke nivasee manoj giri urf chhuttan kii aparaadh kii duniya main ek sharpashooter apradhi ke taur par pahchaan he
 As soon as he started spreading his foot in the land business, the script of caste struggle and gang war in Jhunsi, which had been quiet for the last four years, was ready
 do saal pehle chhatnag se mahamudabad ke paasi bahulya gaanv ustapur kii teen biswa jameen par chhuttan ne apane baahubal se kabja jamaaya to 9 farvari ko varchasv or jaateey sangharsh kii chingaari bade gangvaar ke rup main foot padi
 Shukan Giri and Rishi Bharti gang come face to face
 donon taraf se hui firing main paasi birdari ke shanbhu or harishchandra bharti maare gaye
 After this, the anger erupted with the anger of the Dalits
 gharon main todfod hui, or sarkari gadipoon or bason ko aag ke hawaale kar diya gaya
 In order to control this sudden gang war and the spate of violence that followed, five police stations of Allahabad had to force
 aropiyon par motaa inaam ghoshit kiye jane ke baavjood chhuttïna giri or rishi bharti police kii pahunch se dur hai
 The possibility of unannounced curfew on Chhatnag Road in Jhunsi has arisen due to the possibility of gang war between these two again
 (jhunsi main harishchandra bharti ke maare jane ke baad unke parivaar main matam kaa maahaul)baaluu, sharaab or jameen kii jangjhunsi or gangvaar kaa rishta kareeb chaar dashak purana he
 In 1973, Jhansi's two big mining mafia, Nepali Nishad and Tulsi Nishad, collided in a sand and liquor business in which Nepali was killed
 ek saal baad uske gurgon ne tulsi nishad ko markar badla le liya
 After this, two and a half decades Jhunsi remained a battleground of domination over the sand business
 ek darjan se adhik gangvaar hue, jisamen dedh darjan log maare gaye
 Senior Advocate S
 in Allahabad High Court residing in New Jhunsi
 es
 Says Pandey, "the mining mafia being in the way of Banaras illegally mined sand in the ganga-yamuna and reached the districts of Purvanchal via Jhunsi, but as the residential colonies started to develop in Jhunsi, the sand Businessmen ventured into the land business with relatively higher profits
 ''sarkari nitiyon ne banaae halaatjhunsi main bhu-mafia gang panpane ke peeche us sarkari niti kaa bada yogadan rahaa jo shahar main nujul kii jameen par bad rahe avaidh kabjon ko rokane ke liye laai gai thi
 In the year 1998, the Government amended the Nuzool Manual to make provision for freeholding of Nuzool land in favor of the nominee by the lessee and valued the land as per the 1991 Circle Rate
 elahabaad uttari se vidhayak anugrah narayan singh bataate hai, ''nae kanoon ke baad shahar ke bichombich sasti nujul kii jameen hathiyaane kii hode much gai
 This created new land mafia in the city, who, on the basis of money, nominated the poor tenants in favor of their land and became its owner
 "in the next two-three years, when there was no land left in the city, they Turned to the outskirts
 banaras hive par padane vaale jhunsi main vikaas kii zyada sambhaavnaaon ke chalate yahaan jameen par kabje ke liye bhu-mafia ke bich jor-aajamaaish shuru hui jinhone jameen ke daam achaanak 20 se 25 guna badha die
 People belonging to castes like Pasi, Yadav, Nishad, Kashyap, Mallah, Goswami got the visions of the land mafia on the land they got for lease farming
 jameen ke is chokhe dhandhe par varchasv hi 2005 main jhunsi kii sabase sampann jati yadav ke do guton main gangvaar ke rup main saamne aayaa
 This war is now concentrated between the Yadav, Pasi and Goswami castes
 police kii naakamichhuttan giri kii ati sakriyata ke chalate ek saal pehle hi police ko jhunsi main gangvaar kii bhanak lagi thi
 For this reason, a police post was to be opened at Chhatnag on the banks of the Ganges
 na to chaowkee khuli or na hi police ne jhunsi ke teen bade gang sarganaon par gangster act taamil hone ke baad bhi unki sampatti par kabja kiya
 As a result, even after going to jail, the economic system of these leaders remained and they went out and carried out the gang war
 elahabaad ke varisht police adheekshak umesh chandra shrivastav gangvaar rokane main prashasan kii naakaami ko sweekaar karte hue kehete hai, ''police sabhi jaruri upaay karegi taaki bhavishya main gangvaar kii duusari vaardaat na ho sake
 Jhunsi, famous for its historical heritage like Samudraupa, Gangotri Shivala, is red with a bloody gang war
 paal nareshon or chandelon kii rajdhani rahi jhunsi par us bevakoof raja ne bhi raaj kiya, jiske bare main kaha jaataa he, ''andher nagari chaupat raja, taka ser bhaaji taka ser khaja

 As fingerprint scanner is now being given in almost all mid range smartphones, facial recognition feature will also become common in the coming time
 yah aisa feechar ho jae philhal jaruri to nahin he, lekin companiyaan ise apane smartphone ke marketing ke liye yuj karengi
 In addition to smartphones, the US Trump government may soon implement facial geometry scans to board international flights

 If you use social media, then you will know how Facebook gives the option to tag photos based on your friends' faces
 wo bhi ek tarah kaa facial ricognishan he, lekin ye zyada sicyor he or isse alag he
 Facial Recognition System is a computer application that can verify a person as a digital image
 facial feechar ko database main feed karke uskaa milan digitaly karaayaa jaataa he
 It is usually used in security systems

 For example, a wrong person can enter a restricted area
 itnaa hi nahin agar shakl thodi milti julati hui to bhi samasya aa sakati he
 It is also possible that if there is a mistake in identifying the right person, then what will happen? These are all possible problems that can come in facial recognition and also come from time to time
 privesi samasyasahi galat pahchaan chhod bhi den to facial ricognishan se privesi samasya bhi aa sakati he
 The government can create a database by taking facial details and fingerprints of the people
 is database ko logon ko trek karne ke liye yuj kiya ja saktaa he jo kaaphi khatarnaak sabit hoga

 hindi sahitya main rangamanch ke bare main likhane vaale rachanakaaron main purushon kaa varchasv rahaa he
 From Jagadishchandra Mathur, Nemichandra Jain and Virendra Narayan to Govind Chatak and Devendra Raj Ankur, not all theater critics focused feminism in theater in their writing
 yahi kaaran he ki lokmanch se lekar parsi theatre, ipta andolan or baad main samakaleen rangamanch main striyon ke yogadan par koi mukammal kitaab nahin milti
 There has been discussion of sporadic color reviews and female discourse in articles but there should be research work on them
 is kami ko dur karne kaa ek chota prayaas suparichit lekhika camel kumaar ne kiya he
 Rashtriya Natya Vidyalaya has recently published her book Lokmunch and Stree Discourse of Contemporary Hindi Theater
 haalanki yah koi shodhaparak pustak nahin he or na lokmanch yaa stri vimarsh kaa koi vidhivat itihaas he
 But this is the first time an account of the participation of women in the theater after independence, which gives an overview of the struggle, contribution and challenges of women in Hindi theater
 kareeb 200 prishth kii is kitaab ke teen adhyay hai
 One chapter focuses on the folk stage and the second chapter on the role of women in post-60 modern theater
 tisare adhyay main rangamanch kii 35 abhinetriyon or mahila nirdeshkon ke intervyuu bhi hai
 These include celebrities like Pratibha Agarwal, Mohini Mathur, Sudha Shivpuri, Vijaya Mehta, Uttara Bawkar, Anjala Maharishi, Kavita Nagpal, Girish Rastogi, Amal Allana, Anuradha Kapoor, Surekha Sikri, Sushma Seth, Usha Ganguly, Tripurari Sharma and Hema Singh Who have achieved a place in theater
 is suchi main shila bhaatia, shanta gandhi or neelam maansingh bhi hotin to yah or samrudh hoti
 Nevertheless, these interviews provide new information to the readers
 camel kumaar ne pustak main stri kalakaaron ke jivan sangharsh se lekar unke vyaktitv ke vikaas or unke yogadan ko rekhaankit kiya he
 They have expressed concern that women continued to participate in theater from the Natty era till today, but the dominance of men in this profession remained
 lokmanch main to stri kalakaar upekshit hi raheen or unka kaayade se koi itihaas nahin likhaa gaya
 There were many styles of folk stage in different parts of the country which gave the taste of theater to the people
 par unhen lok manoranjan ke rup main hi dekha gaya or rangamanch kii mukhyayadhara main shaamil nahin kiya gaya
 Thus the distinction between rural and urban theater persisted
 pehle adhyay main camel kumaar ne vibhinn lokasheleyon kii charchaa kii he or pandvani kii mashhoor kalakaar tijan bai or shantibai chelak kaa zikr kiya he
 There is also an interview of Shantabai
 agar tijan bai kaa bhi intervyuu hota to kitaab puri hoti
 Actually, Pandwani has many folk artists who are unknown
 hamaari puri lok kala ke kalakaar gumnami main rahe
 Several years after Gulabo Bai's death, a book came out on him, when the intellectual society came to know about his importance
 camel kumaar ne saath ke baad ke daur main stri nirdeshkon or kalakaaron ke pesh naatakon ke jariye yah bataane kii koshish kii he ki stri kalakaaron-rangakarmiyon ne kai tarah se rangamanch ke muhaavarey ko badal diya
 Around 1960-65, most of these women color workers entered the world of theater and by 1980 they reached the national level
 iske baad do-teen or peedhishaan rangamanch par ain or puraa paridrishy badal gaya
 Till 1980, there was no discussion on the discussion of female dynasty or any workshop seminar
 lekin baad main rashtriya natya vidhyalay ne bhi ise alag se rekhaankit kiya
 The book also tells the stories of the lives and struggles of women recruits and their discrimination in the world of theater
 par sabhi mahila kalakaaron main manzil paa lene kaa aatmavishvaas bhi dikhaai detaa he
 Kamal Kumar deserves congratulations that he has prepared a basis on which the debate on women's discourse can proceed

 *** centre sarkaar ne supreme court main voton kii 'totlifed counting' kaa virodh kiya he
 The Center has said in its affidavit that the issue was considered by the Group of Ministers led by the Union Home Minister
 16 sintabar 2016 ko final meeting kii gai
 In this meeting, it was decided that counting on the basis of booth is better for the party and the candidate because it helps the party or candidate to know in which area he has got more votes and in which part he should work more
 sarkaar ne yah bhi kaha he ki yah tark sahi nahin he ki jin ilaake ke logon ne vot nahin diya, vahaan jeetne ke baad kaam nahin karenge
 This is not possible in the era of media activism
 agar kisi ne aisa kiya to media or soshal madia par aise maamle turant fail jaaenge jisase janpratinidhi or party par dabaav aa jayega
 Anyway, the Election Commission has said that this step cannot be done as an experiment because complete preparations are made for the election
 tippaniyan The Center has also said that it will cost an additional Rs 100 crore to implement it

 wo kabhi ye nahin kahata ki iviem ke saath chhedchhad sambhav nahin he
 That country says that there cannot be tampering
 desh main chunaav ke baad booth ke aadhaar par matganana ke khilaaf daakhil janhit yachika par ye tippanee karte hue mukhya nyaayadhish khehar ne sunwaayee se khud ko alag kar liya he
 Now the second bench will hear the case
 darasal supreme court main daakhil yachika main kaha gaya he ki philhal matagananana ke dauraan booth ke aadhaar par voton kii ginati hoti he jisase ye pataa chal jaataa he ki kis ilaake ke logon ne kis pratyaashee ko vot diya he
 The winning candidate discriminates against the area where the people did not vote
 isliye voton kii ginati ek saath honi chahie
 In this case, the Election Commission had agreed that the proposal has been sent to the Central Government regarding this
 supreme court ne centre sarkaar par naaraazgi jaahir karte hue poocha tha ki wo is niyam ko lagu kyon nahin kar rahi he? The Center has also said that it will cost an additional Rs 100 crore to implement it

 In this case, the Election Commission had agreed that the proposal has been sent to the Central Government regarding this
 supreme court ne centre sarkaar par naaraazgi jaahir karte hue poocha tha ki wo is niyam ko lagu kyon nahin kar rahi he? In fact, in the petition filed in the Supreme Court, it is said that during the counting of votes, the votes are counted on the basis of the booth, which shows that the people of which area have voted for which candidate
 isse jeetne vaala pratyaashee us ilaake se bhedbhaav karata he jahaan ke logon ne vot nahin diya
 Therefore the votes should be counted simultaneously
 is maamle main chunaav ayog ne is par sahmati jataate hue daleel di thi ki ise lekar centre sarkaar ke paas prastaav bheja gaya he
 The Supreme Court had expressed displeasure over the central government and asked why it is not implementing this rule

 main unhen bahut hi samajhadaar aadmi samajhataa tha lekin ab vah ek bigade bachche kii tarah jid kar rahe hai
 The BJP leader said, "the person who will work against the constitution of the country, the law of the country, our party will be against him
" kejariwal and company yadi mahilaon kii suraksha ke liye vaaki kuch karnaa chaahati he to somnath bharti ko turant barkhaast karnaa chahie
 The manner in which Bharti behaved indecently with women cannot be expected
 somnath bharti kanoon mantri hai or vakil bhi hai

 After inspecting the accident site, it is clearly visible that the wheel derailed before reaching Okhla railway station
 takreeban 530 meter kii railway line par lohe ke pahie kii vajah se sleeper tut gaye hai
 The speed of the MEMU train to stop at Okhla station was low and perhaps this is the reason that there are no casualties in this accident
 ferj kiijie ki ye pahiyaa stesan se kaaphi pehle patari se utraa hota to train main savaar saikadon yatriyon ke liye ye haadasa bhayanak ho saktaa tha

 The figure of terror Abu Bakr al Baghdadi is really strange
 haal ke vakt main kisi kii maut ko lekar sabase zyada paheli buujhi gai he to wo bas yahi he
 If its life is a joke then death is a puzzle
 dedh saal se isane maut kii khamoshi akhriyaar kar rakhi thi
 Now suddenly after a year and a half, he has spoken again
 khabar he ki iraq or syria se boria-bistar baandh die jane ke baad ab iesas or uskaa sargana syria se somalia pahunch gaya he
 Somalia becomes isis's new home
 somalia main taiyaar ho rahi he aies kii nai zamin
 Baghdadi, the kingpin of IS, is hidden in Somalia
 america kii nazar bhi ab somalia par
 The genie of IS and Baghdadi has once again come out of the bottle
 duniya ke liye khatm ho chukaa bagdadi or uskaa aies achaanak phir se zindaa ho uthaa he
 According to reports, Baghdadi, after losing its land first in Iraq and then Syria, has reached the land of Somalia with its let of terror
 or ab vahiin se wo aies ke andar ek nai jaan foonkane kii koshish kar rahaa he
 The rest of the world, including America, is now beginning to know why Baghdadi chose Somalia
 darasal somalia main gurbat kaa alam ye he ki ab yahaan chori, kidnaping, samudr main jahaaj lootnaa or phir phiroti maangana sabase bada vyavsaay he
 The rule of terrorist groups prevails here more than the law
 naakaam prashasan or grihayuddh jaise halaat somalia kii sabase badi dikkat he
 And in most parts of the country, there is terror of terrorist organization Al Shabaab
 or ye saare halaat bagdadi ko aatank kii nai jameen taiyaar karne main behad madadgaar sabit ho sakate hai
 The news is that the Islamic State has begun to establish its roots in Somalia in recent times after losing control of Syria and Iraq at the end of last year
 vahaan aies ke hamale bhi bad gaye hai
 IS has claimed to have killed 14 people in the Lower Shabelle area of south Somalia recently
 janvari se july 2018 tak somalia main aies ke hamalon se jude aankade bataate hai ki is desh main aies kii gatividhiyaan bad rahi hai
 IS claims to have carried out several systematic attacks in Somalia
 kuch hamale jo din ke samay kiye gaye unhen filmaaya bhi gaya he
 Initially most of the attacks were claimed to be in the southwestern city of Afgoye
 lekin haal main zyaadaatar hamale rajdhani mogadishu ke aasapaas ke shaharon main ho rahe hai
 According to statistics, IS has carried out 39 attacks in Somalia from January to July this year
 inamen se 27 hamale sirf may, june or july main kiye gaye
 In 2017, the IS made 21 assaults in Somalia throughout the year
 iskaa matlab he ki somalia main aies ke hamalon main badhotaree ho rahi he
 IS carried out most of the ambush or shot killings, but improvised explosive devices (ieds) were also used in some
 aies ke nishane par kufia adhikari, somali police or sanyakarmi rahe
 However, despite increasing IS activities, their attacks in Somalia have been small for the time being
 somalia main aies kaa muqabla aatanki sanghathan al-shabaab ke saath he jo sena, sarkaar or africa senaaon par aksar bade or ghaatak hamale karata he
 And in fact al-shabaab's presence hinders the expansion of IS in Somalia
 somalia main aies ke hamalon kii jaankaree uski media wing amaaq de rahi he
 Most of Amaq's reports contain photographs or videos of the attack or the aftermath
 jinhen dekhakar lagata he ki inhen behad kareeb se filmaaya gaya he
 They have often been filmed with people in broad daylight and public areas
 aies ne ab tak somalia ko samarpit ek hi propeganda video banaaya
 Which was released in December 2017
 jisamen christmas or nae saal ke dauraan 'western target' ke kilaaf hamale ke liye uksaaya gaya tha
 IS has been claiming its presence in Somalia since late 2015
 isamen shaamil zyadatar log pratidwandwial-shababase laae gaye hai
 Abdikadir Mumin has been described as the leader of IS extremists in Somalia
 mumin or uske kuch ladaake al-shabaab se aae hai or aktubar 2015 main wo aies ke mukhiya abu bakar al-bagdadi ke saath ek video main pratigya lete hue dikhaae gaye
 IS was at its peak then
 is saughandh ke baad aies kaa ek media campan bhi aayaa jisamen al-shabaab ke logon se aies main shaamil hone kii apil kii gai thi
 However, due to the dominance of al-shabaab, IS fighters have to chew gnaw to make their way into Somalia
 kyonki al-shabaab desh main aies charampanthiyon kaa khuleam safaaya kar rahaa he
 Even those members who wanted to join IS or had an inclination towards it
 haalanki america kaa maananaa he ki somalia ke aies ladaake yaman se hi hathiyaar kharid rahe hai

 jo kahani 2002 main shuru hui us kahani kii asal patakatha kya 2013 main likhi jaayegi? 2002 main bijepi ke rashtriya adhiveshan main bhi sawaal narendra modi hi the or 11 baras baad 2013 main bhi goa adhiveshan main sawaal modi hi honge
 In 2002, Narendra Modi was asked to step down as Gujarat CM
 2013 main modi ko 2014 kii kaman saunpane kaa sawaal he
 In 2002, Modi's followers laid the board in such a way that Modi's throne remained intact
 or mana yahi gaya ki 2002 main rajdharm kii haar hui or modi kii jeet hui
 At the same time, in 2013, the redcarpet for Modi has been laid in Delhi, but when Modi will run on the redcarpet, Goa Adhivashavan is starting from Friday
 or sawaal ekbar phir modi hai
 The BJP was unable to digest the Gujarat riots during 2002 as the NDA government headed by the BJP was at the center
 lekin 2013 main bijepi ko modi kii aguwai isaliye chaiye kyonki vah kendra kii satta par kabiz hona chaahati he
 That is, Modi, who was a stain for the Vajpayee government in 2002, has become the trump card to bring the BJP to power in 2013
 yani modi ne 2014 ke mishan ko thama to bijepi ke saansadon kii sankhya badhegi lekin bijepi ke bheetar kaa antardvandv yahi he ki modi ke aane se seat to badhati he lekin satta phir bhi dur rahati he
 That is, the BJP should also support the allies who stood with the BJP by putting Ayodhya, Common Civil Code and Article 370 on hold
 isliye sawaal yah nahin he ki modi ke naam kaa elaan goa main ho jaataa he
 The question is that in 2002, the command was with Vajpayee, who was teaching Modi the text of Rajdharma and in 2013 the BJP is going to ride Modi, where everyone is waiting for the new script of Modi's Rajdharma from Gujarat onwards
 
 chandrababu, ajit singh, chautaala, naveen patnayak, jayalalita, mamata banerjee, ramvilas paswan, farrukh abdulla, shibu sorain or karunanidhi
 These are ten faces who were with the BJP in 2002, then the NDA government was formed and was running
 lekin 2004 ke baad se 2013 tak bijepi main bharosa nahin jaagaa he ki endie phir khadi ho or sarkaar banane kii sthiti aa jaye
 But now, as the BJP has agreed to bring Narendra Modi out of Gujarat as the Commander of the Campaign Committee, in 2014, the BJP certainly has its hopes to increase the seats but at the present time the total deposits with the BJP Has three big partners
 niteesha kumaar, uddhav thakare or prakaash singh badal
 And in this too, as soon as Nitish Kumar Modi's name comes up, he is ready to measure the way out of the alliance
 shivasena ke saamne modi kaa naam aane par apane hi vot bank main send lagane kaa khatra he
 So she never hesitates to throw Sushma Swaraj in Advani's tongue and Advani's name
 lekin bijepi modi ko lekar jis mood main he use padhein to teen baaten saaf ubhartee hai
 First- bjp's votes will increase only if Modi's popularity is redeemed
 doosraa- sahyogiyon kii majaburi ke aadhaar par bijepi apane laabh ko ganvaana nahin chaahegi
 And thirdly - if the BJP reaches the figure of 180 under Modi's leadership, then new allies can come together
 or modi ko lekar philhal rajnath goa adhiveshan main isi bisaat ko bichaana chaahate hai jisase sanket yahi jaye ki modi ke virdohi raajnneetik dalon kii apni majaburi chunaav ladane ke liye ho sakati he lekin chunaav ke baad agar bijepi satta tak pahunchane kii sthiti main aati he to sabhi bijepi ke saath khadey honge hi
 Australia's great batsman Sir Don Bradman may have got a glimpse of Sachin Tendulkar's batting style, but former England cricketer Tony Shillinglow has claimed through a study that technically there was a difference of ground between the two cricketers
 ab coach ban chuke tony ne bradmen kii takanic kii vistrut biomacenix adhyayan karke daawa kiya he ki pakistan ke purv captain injamaam ul haq kii style bradmen se milti thi
 He said the only similarity between Bradman and Inzamam was that both the balls were closely watched but Tendulkar bats in the traditional way
 tony ne sidney marning herald se kaha, yah ek myth he ki tendulkar kii ballebaaji dekhte samay bradmen kii jhalak milti he
 There is very little similarity between the two
 tendulkar paaramparik ballebaaj he jabaki bradmen gend ko peetane ke naye tareeke talashte the
 Bradman said in an interview in 1996 that he asked his wife to see Sachin's batting style and he also admitted that the two have similarities in style
 tony ne kaha, maine jitne ballebaajon ko dekha he, unamem injamaam hi bradmen ke sabase kareeb he
 Even if he is very heavy
 unki timming or footwork bradmen ke samaan tha

 Gambhir, who was part of the team that won the T20I in 2007 and the ODI World Cup in 2011, said during an event, "all this media has created an atmosphere for achieving TRP
" ‘us’ match se adhik mahatvapurn yah he ki jo bhi world cap main kheltaa he vah trophy jeetna chahta he

" bada lakshya world cap jeetna hota he
 '' gambhir ne world cap main kisi bhi team ko apni pasandida team nahin bataaya, lekin kaha he ki bhartiya team par ghar main khilne kaa dabaav hoga
 The comments unhone kaha, "jis tarah se bharat khel rahaa, usase main kaaphi khush hum
 Like i said, it is difficult to tell a single team in T20 as a winning contender, because any player can reverse the match
 " Gambhir said, "there will be a lot of pressure on India to play at home
 aap ghar main khel rahe hai, isliye har kisi ko aapse achche pradarshan kii ummid hoti he
 The group India is in is very difficult
 uske group main australia, newjiland or pakistan jaisi timen hai jinke bare main anumaan lagaana mushkil he
 " 2007 main tii-20 or 2011 main vanade world cap jeetne vaali team kaa hissaa rahe gambhir ne ek kaarykram ke dauraan kaha, ‘‘yah sab media ne tiarapy hasil karne ke liye maahaul taiyaar kiya he
 More important than 'that' match is that whoever plays in the World Cup wants to win the trophy
 bharat or pakistan ke bich match sirf ek anya match kii tarah hi he
 '' unhone kaha, ‘‘log ise lekar hip banaate hai, lekin agar aap khilaadi se puuchhen to ve ise ‘us’ match kii tarah nahin dekhte
 The big goal is to win the World Cup
 ’’ Gambhir did not mention any team in the World Cup as his favorite team, but said that the Indian team would be under pressure to play at home
 tippaniyan He said, "I am very happy with the way India is playing
 maine jaise kaha ki tii-20 main kisi ek team ko jeet kaa daavedaar bataanaa mushkil he, kyonki koi bhi khilaadi match palat saktaa he
 " gambhir ne kaha, "bharat par ghar main khilne kaa kaaphi dabaav rahegaa
 You are playing at home, so everyone expects a good performance from you
 bharat jis group main he vah kaaphi mushkil he
 His group has teams like Australia, New Zealand and Pakistan which are difficult to guess
 " He said, "people make hype about it, but if you ask the player, they don't see it like that match

 Kamal Haasan - is like a universal hero for his fans, who have been in the limelight for the past several months due to their controversial statements
 hasan, tamilnadu kii raajnneeti main aane ke sanket de rahe hai
 They are constantly meeting leaders of various political parties
 inamen kerala ke mukhyamantri pinaraayi vijayan or dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal jaise netaa bhi shaamil hai
 Now Kamal Haasan has created controversy by giving another statement of his own
 mashhoor film abhinayta ne kaha ki hindu aatankwaad kii baat kehane vaale logon ko dakshinpanthi chanlej nahin kar sakate hai, kyonki aatank hindu camp main bhi pahunch gaya he
 Following this statement by Kamal Haasan, BJP leader Subramanian Swamy and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh ideologue Rakesh Sinha have retaliated
 aakhir camel hasan ne kya kaha?dakshinpanthi raajnneeti karne waalon par sidhaa nishaanaa sadhate hue camel hasan ne kaha ki pehle dakshinpanthi hindu log hinsa main shaamil nahin hote the, ve apane virodhiyon kaa tarkon ke aadhaar par virodh karte hue shastrarth karte the
 But, this old strategy was defeated and now they use force in what they do
 hasan ne kaha, 'ab unhone hinsa failaana shuru kar diya he
 Kamal Haasan said, 'hindus cannot talk to the right-wing people who talk about terrorism, because terror has also reached the Hindu camp
 is tarah kii aatanki gatividhiyaan unhen kisi tarah kii madad nahin karne vaali
 BJP MP Subrahmanyam Swamy retaliated on the statement of Karkavarakamal, BJP leader Subrahmanyam Swamy said, 'kamal Haasan is not an honest person nor is he fair
 agar hote enie ko jaakar bataate yaa complen register karte, jo unhone nahin kiya

 He said that his three films have flopped, so now he wants to retire from cinema
 isliye is tarah ke statement de rahaa hai
 It is not going to happen, so is flattering the communists
 lenin ne kaha tha ki kai idiyat bhi yujaphul hote hai
 Swamy said that he is making baseless allegations, he has no proof
 RSS vichaarak rakesh sinha kaa bhi palatwarasang vichaarak rakesh sinha ne kaha ki camel hasan tamilnadu main piefai or al ummaa ke prabhaav main aakar hindu aatank kii baat kar rahe hai
 He should apologize for insulting and hurting feelings of Hindu civilization

 All his films are beating
 lihaaja wo is tarah ke bayaan de rahe hai
 a case should be registered against them and the government there should treat them in a good hospital
 hindu aatankwaadi nahin ho saktaa hai
 There is Islamic terrorism all over the world
 unke aatanki camp chalate hai
 They should go and see in Kashmir
 tab unako samaj main aayega ki islamic aatankwaad kya hota hai?jis tarah wo kerala ke mukhyamantri kii tarif kar rahe hai, usase lagata hai ki wo left netaaon se prabhavit hai
 Therefore, they are making such statements
 filmon main pitane ke baad ab wo raajnneeti main aana chahta hai
 That is why they want to do politics between Hindu and Muslim
 camel hasan par cese darj hona chahie
 If he does not have evidence, then he should be sent to jail and he should also feed the prison air
 camel hasan ke chaahane waalon ko he 7 november kaa intjaarhasan kaa bayaan us samay aayaa he jab unke chaahane vaale or sabhi badi partiyon ke netaa 7 november ko unke janmdin ke maukey par hone vaali badi ghoshnaa kaa intjaar kar rahe hai
