calraj mishra ke rahete hue mahendra pandey ko brahman cheharaa bataane kaa kya tuk he? kya mahendra pandey calraj mishra se bade netaa hai yaa calraj mishra ab brahman netaa nahin rahe? aresas pramukh praaia: brahman hi hote hai
 Many Brahmin leaders are also established in BJP
 kya ye sabhi upi main brahman vot nahin laa sakate
 i do not understand many times on what basis we see someone's caste bigger than politics
 agar chunaav or jati ke aadhaar par hi ye saansad banaae gaye hai to do saal baad hue is pehle vistaar se yahi lagata he ki modi hi nahin bhartiya raajnneeti ke paas koi nayaa idia nahin he
 There was a lot of discussion about the picture of two mps coming to Parliament by bicycle
 bina shaq ye saraahneey kaary he
 But before making him the representative face of the environment, at least it would be seen what the environmental policies of the government are
 unke kya asar hone vaale hai
 The bicycle is the final representative, so what is the policy? vaise meghavaal shreshth saansad chune gaye hai or prashasnic anubhav bhi he unke paas
 But when all the Dalit mps like him do not come up during the time of Dalit issues, how do they become representatives of all the Dalits from UP to India as soon as they become ministers
 he jaankaron, is lihaaz se to pradhanmantri ko ye karnaa chahie ki sabhi pramukh jatiyon ke sharma, patel, singh, sinha ko mantri banaakar so janaa chahie
 Not that i would have discussed anything differently
 main bhi hota to shaayad yahi sab baaten kar rahaa hota
 It is perhaps because of this that India's politics and its analysts have taken root
 unke paas koi nayaa paimaana nahin he
 Everything in our politics has been decided before we were born
 ham sab use paalane posane ke liye duniya main aae hai! har ankar duusare jaankaar ko sahi kah rahaa he ki aap upi ko dusron se acha jaanate hai
 You know Modi best
 nayaa kya bataa rahe ho jaankaron jo aap saare logon se behatar jaanate hai
 Tell Me No! Comments agar raajnneeti sirf chhavi or projection kaa khel he to janata ko dinabhar tivi hi dekhnaa chahie
 He should keep writing in the passbook the names of ministers of his caste instead of jobs, promotions and cheap studies and cheap hospitals
 pehle se jo mantri bane hai wo bhi umr, jati or anubhav kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai
 They were also told in this way
 un paimaanon par unka pradarshan kya rahaa he? koi bataa saktaa he? agar assam haar jate to kya pradhanmantri or shah istifa dete? kya ye pehle se hi majboot nahin hai? agar haar jeet inaki majbooti kaa paimaana he to upi haarane ke baad shah kya gujarat bhej diye jaayenge? The same thing happens at the center as well as in the states
 isse janata kaa kya bhala ho rahaa he
 Do these faces also represent any policy? Do they have any thoughts of their own? Do they all have the ability to win elections on their own? Today, all the ministers of UP are being told the face of caste and region, some one can lay hands on the heart and ask whether all these would have won the elections in 2014 without Modi wave? Did you hear the names of Krishna Raj, Mahendra Pandey during the elections? Listening for 2-3 days or years? Best wishes to all the new ministers
 bijepi ke paas sabase adhik dalit saansad hai
 Then why did the national president have to do politics of bathing in harmony in Kumbh? Did the rest of the Dalit mps also take a bath with them? Due to UP, Dalit mps have become ministers, so what was the deficiency in Udit Raj? Will he also get a big ministry due to being a Dalit? Will become Minister of State for Finance or will continue to be Minister of Social Welfare or Child Welfare
 cabinet mantri ban rahe hai ye dalit saansad yaa rajya mantri? rajya mantriyon ke paas kya kaam hota he, achaanak charchaaon se gaayab hai
 Arun Jaitley and Kalraj Mishra have been described as Brahmin faces by these TV experts

 tivi ke inhen jaankaron ke dwaara arun jetali or calraj mishra ko brahman cheharaa bataaya ja chukaa he
 What is the point of telling Mahendra Pandey a Brahmin face while Kalraj Mishra? Is Mahendra Pandey a bigger leader than Kalraj Mishra or is Kalraj Mishra no longer a Brahmin leader? RSS chiefs are usually Brahmins
 bijepi main bhi kai brahman netaa sthapit hai
 Can not all these Brahmins bring votes in UP
 mujhe kai baar samaj nahin aata ki kis aadhaar par ham kisi kii jati ko raajnneeti se bada dekhne lagate hai
 If these mps have been formed on the basis of elections and caste, then from the first expansion after two years, it seems that not only Modi but Indian politics has no new idea
 do saansadon kii cycle se sansad aane kii tasviir kii kaaphi charchaa hui
 It is a commendable work without doubt
 lekin unhen paryaavaran kaa pratinidhi cheharaa banane se pehle kam se kam yah to dekh liya jaataa ki sarkaar kii paryaavaran kii nitiyaan kya hai
 What are their effects? cycle hi antim pratinidhi he to phir niti kya he
 By the way, Meghwal has been elected the best parliamentarian and has administrative experience
 lekin unke jaise tamaam dalit saansad jab dalit muddon ke samay saamne nahin aate to mantri banate hi kaise ye upi se lekar bharat ke tamaam daliton ke pratinidhi ban jate hai
 o experts, in this context, the Prime Minister should do this, that Sharma, Patel, Singh, Sinha of all the major castes should be made to sleep by making them ministers
 aisa nahin he ki main kuch alag tareeke se charchaa karata
 i would have been doing all these things if i were
 shaayad isiilie lag rahaa he ki bharat kii raajnneeti or uske vishleshak jad ho chuke hai
 They have no new scale
 hamaari raajnneeti main sab kuch hamaare paidaa hone se pehle tay ho chukaa he
 We have all come into the world to raise him! Every anchor is telling the other person right that you know UP better than others
 aap modi ko sabase behatar jaanate hai
 What are you saying, new experts, who know you better than all the people? tail me na!tippaniyan If politics is just a game of image and projection then the public should watch TV all day long
 use naukari, taraqqi or sasti padhai or saste aspataal kii jagah apni jati ke mantriyon ke naam passbook main likhte rahanaa chahie
 The ministers who have been made earlier also represent age, caste and experience
 wo bhi isi tarah se bataaye gaye
 What has been their performance on those scales? Anyone can tell Had Assam lost, would the Prime Minister and Shah resign? Aren't they already strong? If victory is the strength of their strength, then will Shah be sent to Gujarat after losing UP? centre hi nahin rajyon main bhi yahi hota he
 What is the good of the public due to this
 kya ye chehre kisi niti kaa bhi pratinidhitiv karte hai? kya inaki apni koi soch he? kya ye sabhi apane dam par chunaav jeetne kii kshamta rakhte hai? aaj upi ke jitne mantri jati or ilaake kaa cheharaa bataaye ja rahe hai koi dil par haath rakh kar kahe ki kya ye sabhi bina modi lahar ke 2014 main chunaav jeet jate? kya aapane chunaavon ke dauraan krishna raaj, mahendra pandey kaa naam suna tha? do teen din se sun rahe hai yaa varshon se? sabhi nae mantriyon ko shubhakamanaayen

 spain ke barsilona main lashkar-e-taiyaba or alqaida jaise aatankwaadi sanghathanon ko sandigdh taur par jaali passport muhaiyaa karaane ke maamle main chah pakistani or ek africa mul ke naagarik kii giraftaar ke baad praathmik taur par in sandigdhon kaa mumbai hamale se koi sampark sutara judata nahin dikh rahaa he
 Primarily this case seems to be connected only with the supply of fake documents
 grih mantralay ke sutron ne praathmik jaanch ke baad barsilona se aa rahi soochnaaon kaa hawala dete huye bataaya ki halanki giraftaar saaton vyaktiyon ke bare main al kaayda jaise aatankwaadi sanghathanon se santh-ganth kii baat sochi ja rahi thi, lekin is bare main koi saboot nahin mil paa rahe he
 The presumption that the Spanish police were following seems to be proven wrong on the basis of the documents
 in dastavejon ko dekhakar yah kahana mushkil he ki inkaa sambandh aatankwaadiyon ke sanghathanon se ho saktaa he
 India has sought information from Spain about all these arrested civilians, who are alleged to have supplied fake passports to organizations such as Al Qaeda and lashkar-e-taiba

 There is currently suspense about AIADMK General Secretary VK Sasikala taking oath as Chief Minister
 darasal, wike shashikala ke khilaaf aay se adhik sampatti kaa cese chal rahaa he
 On which the decision of the Supreme Court can come next week
 agar shashikala doshi tehrai jaati hai to rajya main phir se raajnneetik asthirataa aa jaaegi or shashikala ke mukhyamantri banane kii khwaahish par pani phir saktaa he
 In view of this, the Governor has sought legal favor from Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi
 gauratlab he ki yah cese un yachikaaon se judaa hua he, jinamein jayalalita kii kareebi maane jane vaali shashikala ko maamle se bari kiye jane kaa virodh kiya gaya he
 The Supreme Court had reserved its judgment on the group of petitions, 66 against Sasikala and her two relatives
 65 karod rupee kii aay se adhik sampatti ke maamle main unhen bari kiye jane kii chunauti di gai thi
 a public interest litigation has also been filed in the Supreme Court on Monday, seeking to stop Sasikalako from swearing in as Chief Minister
 kyonki die maamle main doshi qaraar hone par agar unhen istipha dena padaa to kanoon vyavastha kharaab ho sakati he
 In the Legislature Party meeting, Sasikala was elected as the leader and CM Panneerselvam has also cleared the way for Sasikala by resigning as Chief Minister

 Viswanathan Anand winning the fifth World Championship in Moscow is really enjoyable
 nason ko jhanjhna dene vaale ek ti-brake ke ant main unki boris gelphand (anand se ek saal bade) par kathor, rukhi jeet hui
 Although the tie-break has been in force since the 1985 World Championships, it was first needed in 1998, when Russia's Anatoly Karpov defeated his Indian player
 anand ko '90 ke dashak main litening kid ke naam se pukaara jaataa tha
 This time it was the turn of the Lightning Kid in Moscow
 anand jab peshewar shatranj khilne ke liye taiyaar hue to unka paala soviet sangh ke vastutah un shatranj mashiinon se padaa jo kareeb chaar dashakon se sabhi virodhiyon ko dhul chataa rahe the
 In those countries of Eastern Europe, talent was often recognized at the age of six
 unhen taraasha, prashikshit kiya jaataa or use us circuit main bhej diya jaataa, jise unki janani rus kii viraasat or diggaj prashikshakon kii sena kaa samarthan hasil tha
 Each player had two or three 'seconds' (chess vocabulary for assistants, coaches, partners) behind them, who would gain information about his future opponent
 anand shatranj kii duniya main ek aise kishor ke rup main utre jiske paas apane khel ke alaava or kuch nahin tha
 He landed with such stubbornness that it was difficult to guess a humble, attractive player like him until he sat in front of the chess board at the table
 tab unke pratidwandviyon ko mahasoos hota ki is chashme, saaf patte vaale baalo, press kii hui shart or pant ke peeche ek krur pratidwandvi he (kabhi anand ne khulaasa kiya tha ki pratidwandviyon ke mood or unki soch kaa andaja sirf unki saanson kii aawaaj sunakar hi lagaaya ja saktaa he)
 Anand — and Gelfand — is the generation of players who entered the chess world just before computers began
 ve sarvaadhik vividhta vaale or lacheele vishwa shatranj champion ho sakate hai, jisane is khel kii sabhi vidhaon main khitaab jite hai-clasical, nokout or toornament
 He is also the first Asian to win the title
 2012 kii vishwa championships main ve vishwa vijeta vaali form ke saath nahin gaye the
 His ELO rating had dropped by 26 points in the last six months
 ve number van nahin the or haal main hi pita bane the
 In the midst of all this, he had to face an opponent who was running extremely unpredictable tricks of his life
 anand ke liye yah unke jivan kaa 'sabase kathin' match tha
 Not only this, the most interesting moment came in the eighth game
 anand ko saatven game main gelphand ke haathon haar jhelni padi thi lekin 17 chaalon main unhone apane pratidwandvi kaa safaya kar diya
 It was the shortest game to ever result in the final of a World Chess Championship
 shatranj coach raghunandan gokhale kehete hai, 'anand ek sampurna shatranj khilaadi hai
 If Kramnik likes cool and cool games, Anand plays a fairly esoteric game
 topalov agar gudhata se khilne lagen to anand shant ravaiya apana lete hai
 In many ways, Gelfand can also be called a complete player, but you did not make a mistake that Anand will digest you
 is final main anand ne behatar santulan banaae rakhaa he
 In the classical game, Anand found himself out of the uncomfortable situations Gelfand created
 pichley 10 varshon main pehali baar unhone khud ko itani buree tarah ghira hua paaya tha
 International chess player and columnist Devanshu Dutta says, 'huananda is a very fast-thinking player
 ''ti-brake game khatm ho saktaa tha lekin ''gelphand aisi sthiti main pahunch gaye the, jahaan unke paas sirf do second kaa samay bachaa tha or yaheen unhone gambhir galati kar di
 World titles like this and 25
 5 lakh dollar kii inami rakam kaa faisla sirf do second main ho gaya
 "when Anand returns to Chennai to spend time with his son Anand Akhil, others will be ready to challenge the world champion in 2013
" anand jaanate hai ki ti-brake se jeeta koi bhi vishwa shatranj champion (1998 main karpov, 2004 main rustam kasimajhanov or 2006 main vladimir kramnik) dobaaraa nahin jeet paaya he
 Many young players (and of course Gelfand too, trying to stand again) are waiting to win the title and pounce
 yah phir se anand ke liye sabase kathin game sabit hoga
 Has Anand ever played in extreme adversity? Just think of the teenager who landed against Soviet machines at the age of about 20, played in every format of the game at the age of 30, at the age of 40 to play the World Championship in Sofia in Volcano
 In order to avoid the ash clouds, he drove 2,000 kilometers in 40 hours through five countries of Europe
 (unhone is yatra kii thakaan ko dur karne ke liye aayojakon se toornament ko teen din taalane kii maang kii lekin unhen sirf ek din kii mohalat di gai)
 So when there is competition between Anand and adversity - age or time - do a lot of thinking in predicting the winner or the result
 shatranj main unke khilaaf badi se badi galati main sirf do second hi lagate hai

 In a special conversation with Aaj Tak, former PM Manmohan said, 'I am deeply saddened by the misleading propaganda of Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 PM modi apni urja kaa istemaal desh ke nirmaan main karen
 Attacking PM Modi, he said that he himself went to Pakistan without any invitation and today is questioning our patriotism, which is totally wrong

 According to Manmohan Singh, no dinner was held at the house of Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar
 unhone aakhir main kaha ki ummid he ki piem modi apane galat bayanon ko lekar maafee maangenge
 During this, Manmohan Singh also raised the question that after all, why did PM Modi allow the investigation agency of Pakistan to visit the spot after the terrorist attack in Pathankot in Punjab? He said that PM Modi is making such ridiculous allegations to win the Gujarat assembly elections
 maaloom ho ki ravivaar ko banaaskantha ke palanpur main ek chunavi raily ko sambodhit karte hue modi ne aarope lagaaya tha ki gujarat ke vidhansabha chunaav main congress ke varisht netaa seemaa paar se madad se le rahe hai
 With the attack on Congress, Modi had asked that why are people in Pakistan holding high positions in Army and Intelligence talking about the help of making Ahmed Patel CM in Gujarat? Modi asked what does it mean? In addition, on Wednesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi again attacked the Congress and the UPA government while addressing the 90th annual general meeting of FICCI
 unhone kaha ki upi sarkaar ke dauraan bainkon ke jariye 2ji or kaaman velth ghotaale se bhi bada ghotaalaa kiya gaya
 He claimed that it was the biggest scam in India during UPA rule
 piem modi ne kaha, ''mujhe jaankaree nahin he ki pehle kii sarkaar kii nitiyon ne jis tarah banking sector kii durdasha kii, us par fikki ne koi survey kiya he yaa nahin? ye aajkal NPA kaa jo hallaa much rahaa he, wo pehle kii sarkaar main baithe arthshaastriyon kii, is sarkaar ko di gai sabase badi Liability he

 jab ise aspataal laayaa gaya to doctor ilaaj kii bajaae ulte is ladki ko hi jhootha sabit karne main jute gai
 The rage was such that doctors beat him up
 ladki or uske parijanon kaa aarope he kii aspataal main sarkari mahila doctor ne use peeta, thappad maare or kaha kii vah naatak kar rahi he lihaaja rape kaa bayaan na de
 The police also went a step ahead of the doctors in the torture and did not show much interest in capturing the remaining accused after detaining one accused
 police pehle to balaatkaar kii baat maanane se hi inkaar kar di, phir jab mudde ne tool pakadaa to chand ghanton main sur badal gaye
 After the media reports, the police made a second arrest and the hospital administration is denying that the victim was slapped
 ladki ke haalat aise nahin ki thik se bol bhi paae, lekin phir bhi jab jubaan khuli to dil main bhari badale kii bhaavana foot padi
 Justice's plea has turned into anger
 peedita ladkadaati jubaan main kahati he, ‘agar police ne kuch nahin kiya to main khud thik hokar unhen maar daaloongi
 First misbehaving in hospital then refusal to write police report
 ye donon hi baaten ishaara karti hai ki desh bhar main mahilaon ke haq main uth rahi awaajon kaa kam se kam in par to ratti bhar bhi asar nahin hua he

 Active participation of the public is the key to bringing accountability and transparency in urban governance
 aap kisi shahar ko jinda or behtareen tabhi kah sakate hai jab vahaan har kisi ke paas rahane ko ghar ho, buniyadi suvidhaayen hon, sabake liye maukey hon
 a city should also assess whether it has achieved the minimum level of basic amenities for every occupant and whether poverty is declining
 globaligeshan ke daur ne shaharon main nai samasyaayein khadi kar di hai, jo chintaa kaa kaaran hai
 The rapid pace of urbanization in India is astonishing
 desh main shahari aabaadi ko 23 karod tak pahunchane main kareeb 40 saal (1971-2008) lage, lekin agle 25 karod jodgaye main shaayad isse aadha samay hi lagegaa
 According to the 2011 census, in 2025, the urban population is estimated to be 51 million 90 million
 pichley 60 saal main rashtriya str par prati vyakti bhoomi kshetra 0
 Less than 90 hectares to 0
 26 hectare rah gaya he
 Demand for urban land is increasing
 kasbon kii sankhya 54 pratishat badi he
 In 2001 it was 5,161 and in 2011 it was 7,935
 toun and country planning orgenigeshan ke anusaar, 7,935 kasbon main se sirf 24 pratishat ke paas master plan he
 This simply means that about 75 percent of urban settlements are spreading without any planning or planned structure
 shaharon ke badhate aakaar or pradhanta ke saath unki maang ko puraa karne ke liye aavashyak aasapaas ke kshetra bhi failte hai
 The ecological footprint means the land required for daily life in the city and the demand for vegetation needed to digest the carbon dioxide produced in the city also increases manifold
 bade shaharon main rojgaar miltaa he, lekin vastav main rojgaar se zyada, behatar rojgaar kii aas logon ko shahar khinch laati he
 Development is imbalanced due to regional imbalances arising from the primacy of a few large urban communities
 isliye jaruri he ki 12veen yojana main 55 lakh karod ru
 The infrastructure development that has been envisaged at an estimated cost of Rs, should be spread evenly to small and medium towns
 pradooshan, tanaav or asuraksha ke oonche str bade shahar main jivan kii gunvattta main giravat ke pramaan hai
 The pattern of consumption of water, electricity and other essential commodities shows a deep gap between the actual demand and availability of resources, which makes cities basically not sustainable
 aane-jane or naagarik sevaaon ke liye lambii or lalaphitaashahee main uljhi prakriyaaon jaisi anutpaadak gatividhiyon main kaaphi urja or samay barbaad hota he

 Transparency is down on their priority list
 unhen badalanaa hoga
 Urban administration needs a new and public-friendly approach
 har shahar main nishchit sankhya main aabaadi ko sahaara dene kii ek adhiktam seemaa hoti he jo uske buniyadi dhaanche kii boj uthaane kii kshamta par nirbhar he
 Despite this, settlements have spread beyond the urban limits in most metros, making the format of population density stifling
 janaganana main is prakriya ko bade mahanagaron ke aasapaas faile shahari jamaavade yaa kasbon kaa naam diya gaya he
 This increase is also partly due to inappropriate policies of land use
 ek taraf kheti kii upjau jameen shahari upyog main lee ja rahi he, duusari taraf shahari jameen par mutthibhar vikaas agenciyon ke ekadhikaar ne jameen kii keemat kaaphi badha di he
 Unplanned and short-sighted policies in the planning of towns have hindered the natural flow of drainage, causing massive flooding during rains
 jab tak aaj ke bade shahar vikaas ke model bane rahenge, tab tak bhavishya ke shaharon ko tikaoo banane kii ummid kam he
 In countries around the world that have understood the issue of sustainability a little too much, there is one thing common in the success achieved and that is to delegate responsibility to the public
 shahari prashasan main javabdehi or paardarshita laane kii kunjee janata kii sakriy bhagidaari main he
 The process of empowering panchayats at the grassroots level must be strengthened

 The decisions of the lower level should loosen the grip of the higher officials

 It is our responsibility to find solutions for our housing that can provide at least some credibility to the ideal of making our urban settlements sustainable

 mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ke khilaaf dilli police ke ek consteble ne shikaayat darj karai he
 Constable Harvinder, posted at Govindpuri police station, has accused Kejriwal of using abusive language in a complaint to Delhi Police Commissioner BS Bassi
 kejariwal ne police ke liye 'thulla' shabd kaa istemaal kiya tha
 In fact, in a special interview given to 'aaj Tak', Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal used the word 'thulla' for the police, after which Police Commissioner BS Bassi objected to this statement
 unhone kaha, 'agar mukhyamantri ne aisa kaha he to yah apmanjanak he
 They should respect the organization
 ' vahiin, dabri police stesan main bhi consteble kapur singh ne arvind kejariwal ke bayaan kaa virodh ke khilaaf shikaayat di he
 This is Kejriwal's complete statement
 Kejriwal said in the interview, 'the Delhi Government's Anti Corruption Branch (ACB) can file a case against the corrupt person
 ye kehete hai ki dilli police kaa thulla agar kisi rehadi patari vaale se paise maangata he to uske khilaaf bhi cese nahin hona chahie, yah manjuur nahin he
 'in many cases in the past too, face-to-face constables have lodged a complaint against Kejriwal objecting to the use of the same word
 bataa den ki isse pehle bhi dilli sarkaar or dilli police kai maamalon par aamane-saamne ho chuki he or haal hi main minakshi murder cese ke badakejariwal sarkarpulice par centre ke ishaare par kaam karne or laaparvaahee baratane kaa aarope bhi laga chuki he
 Afghanistan has been a laboratory of terrorists for a long time
 yahaan ek nahin balki kai aatanki sanghathan kaam kar rahe hai
 In order to maintain their dominance, they are not only spreading terror with bomb ammo but also preparing human bombs
 iske liye aatanki sanghathan baqayada training centre banaate hai
 Where its training takes place
 afghanistan main aisi hi kai aatank kii factory taliban ne bhi bana rakhi hai
 The Taliban runs a jihadi factory
 jahaan chalata he aatank kaa kaarkaana or banate hai suicide bombar
 Taliban's nefarious terrorists carry out their plans, its jihadi fighters
 jo taliban kii sabase badi takat hai
 These jihadi fighters can do anything at the command of their boss
 jaan le bhi sakate hai to jaan de bhi sakate hai
 Yes, they are jihadis
 lekin sajaase bada sawaal ye he ki aakhir in jihadiyon kii nason main nafrat kaa barud is kadar kaise bharaa jaataa hai
 After all, how are they prepared to die
 ham aapako bataaenge jihadiyon kii training kaa puraa sach
 Jihadis take death training
 These fighters are taught the lesson of terror in four parts
 jihadiyon yaa aatankiyon ko chaar hisson main training di jaati he
 These four stages are very dangerous
 pehla sabak- al radjisaki miyaad teen maheene kii hoti he
 During this period, recruits from the age of sixteen to twenty one are prepared physically and mentally
 is bich ladaakon ko shaadi karne kii ijaajat nahin hoti
 For this training, it is also necessary that the selected fighters do not have any kind of disease
 unhen padhanaa likhnaa aata ho or wo jihad ke liye puri tarah taiyaar hon
 Second lesson - guerrilla training training is six months long
 is dauraan jehad ke liye samarpit ladaakon ko hathiyaar chalaanaa sikhaaya jaataa he
 Before this training, all fighters have to prepare a will with their own hands and give it to their commander
 jisamen wo apni jindagi jihad ke naam kar dete hai
 Third lesson - Jindalaye training lasts for three months
 isamen aatankiyon ko khaastaur par bam banane kii training di jaati he
 In this part of the training, terrorists are also given training in heavy weaponry
 unhen kai tarah ke ghaatak chote or bade bam banane kii training di jaati he
 Fourth lesson - Doshkaye training lasts from a week to ten days
 is dauraan ladaakon ko haath se chalane vaale chote hathiyaaron, jaise pistaul or chaaku chalaane kii khaas training di jaati he
 They are given mastery in wielding a number of secret and small arms
 vaise to ye chaaron sabak seekhney ke baad hi jihadi training puri ho jaati he
 During this training, the dirty game of creating hatred in the name of religion in the hearts and minds of terrorists also continues
 jo jihadiyon ko sabase zyada prabhavit karata he
 After this, the jihadis are ready to kill anyone
 par asli training to abhi baaki hi rahati he
 This is how human bombs are made, in fact, these terrorists are prepared to die at any time
 or wo ban jate hai maanav bam
 Yes, human bombs, the most dangerous weapon of the Crusaders
 jisamen khud to unki jaan jaati hi he,saath hi wo apane saath kai jindagiyon ko hameshaa ke liye khamosh kar dete hai
 For this training, a special class is organized
 jisamen maanav bam kaise or kin haalat main bananaa he, is par khaas jor diya jaataa he
 After all these training, now all the fighters become Jihadis and start the business of spreading terror all over the world

 bjp's Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi accused Congress President Sonia Gandhi of spreading lies about Gujarat and challenged her to a public debate on it
 modi ne kaha ki yadi jhooth bolnaa adarsh aachaar samhita kaa ulanghan he, to chunaav ayog ko congress adhyaksh ke khilaaf karrwai kerani chahie
 He said in a public meeting, Madam Sonia has tried to mislead the people of Gujarat and the country, i challenge her to open debate on this
 modi ne kaha, sonia ne kaha he ki gujarat main bich main padhai chhod dene vaale vidhyaarthiyon kaa pratishat desh main sabase adhik he, jo satya nahin he
 He said that when he came to power, this percentage was 21 between class i to V, which has now come down to two per cent
 modi ne kaha ki kuposhan ke maamle par sonia logon ko gumraah kar rahi hai
 He said, malnutrition is also present in other parts of the country
 gujarat ne is samasya se nijaat ke liye mahati kaam kiya he or kaig ne bhi hamaare kaam kii saraahna kii he
 Nose, Ear and Throat Doctor (ENT) -based leader Dr
 harshavardhan, dilli ke iklaute saansad hai, jinhen narendra modi sarkaar kii duusari pari main bhi cabinet mantri banane kaa mauka mila he
 The special thing is that within six months of becoming a minister in 2014, the ministry which was taken away from him has succeeded in regaining it this time

 He has again received the command of this important ministry related to the health security of the people of the country

 Harshvardhan has also been a five-time MLA

 In the meantime, he was a doctor by profession, Dr

 Dr
 harshavardhan ko tab vigyaan or prodyogiki, bhuvigyaan mantralay kii jimmedaari mili thi
 However, questions were also raised about JP Nadda being made the health minister at that time
 maamla ames main satarkta adhikari ke taur par karyrat iesces afasar sanjeev chaturvedi ko hataane se judi ek chitthee likhe jane kaa tha
 There were allegations by the Aam Aadmi Party and other opposition parties about Nadda's alleged role in removing Sanjeev Chaturvedi from the post of CVO at that time
 baharhaal, is baar modi cabinet main jepi nadda ko jagah nahin mili he
 There is speculation that he has been kept out of the government to make him the new president of BJP
 kyonki bijepi main ek vyakti- ek pad siddhant lagu he

 For the first time in four and a half years of the Modi government, the opposition has brought a no-confidence motion
 sarkaar ke paas bahumat ke aankade se zyada number he, isliye wo is prastaav ke safal na hone ko lekar aashwast he
 In the history of the Parliament of the country, so far, no confidence motion has come about 26 times, but only twice the opposition has got success in it
 nehru ke khilaaf pehali baar aayaa tha avishvaas prastaavbhartiya sansad main pehali baar avishvaas prastaav 1963 main tatkaaleen pradhanmantri jawahar laal nehru ke khilaaf aayaa tha

 After this, Indira Gandhi came to power
 shastri ke bache hue kaarykaal ko indira gandhi ne puraa kiya
 During this time a motion was brought against him twice
 indira ke khilaaf sabase zyada baar aayaa avishvaas prastaavbhartiya sansadeey itihaas main sabase zyaada avishvaas prastaav kaa saamana pradhanmantri indira gandhi kii netritv vaali congress sarkaar ko karnaa padaa he

 apni haar kaa andaja lagate hi morarji desai ne mat-vibhaajan se pehle hi istipha de diya
 Narasimha Rao had to face thrice
 Like Saamlal Bahadur Shastri, Narasimha Rao's government also faced a motion of no confidence three times
 1993 main narsimha raav bahut kam antar se apni sarkaar ke khilaaf laae gaye avishvaas prastaav ko maat de paae

 nae saal ke aagaaj par uttar korea ke supreme leader kim jong un ne america ko khuleam parmaanu hamale kii dhamkee dekar tisare vishwayuddh kii ashanka ko or badha diya he
 About four and a half hundred years ago, the famous French 16th century (1503–1566) century prophet Nostradamus also predicted the start of the Third World War in 2018
 unhone kaha tha ki saal 2018 main bheeshan prakritik aapadaaen aaengi, arthvyavastha tahas-nahas ho jaaegi or teesraa vishwayuddh shuru ho jayega
 The predictions of Nostradamus have been proved right before, which is bound to increase the concern of the world
 vartmaan samay menuttar korea or americake bich jis tarah kii tanatani chal rahi he, usase to yahi lagata he ki is saal parmaanu yuddh kaa talanaa mushkil he
 If the third world war happened, it would be even more terrible than the first and second world war
 vaishvik vyavastha tahas-nahas ho jaaegi
 During his speech on the New Year, North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un threatened the US, saying, "the entire land of America is in our nuclear missiles and the button of these missiles is always on my table
" '' unhone kaha ki uttar korea sabase badi parmaanu shakti banakar duniya ke saamne aayega
 Earlier, the North Korean state media said that in 2018, his country would continue nuclear testing, thereby emerging as an 'invincible' nuclear power
 ek ajey shakti ke rup main uttari korea ke astitv ko na hi kamjor kiya ja saktaa he or na hi nakaara ja saktaa he
 Even before Nastredamus' predictions have been proved, most of the predictions Nastredamus made for the coming 20 centuries have come true
 isliye puri duniya ke log nastredamas kii bhavishyavaaniyan par kaaphi had tak yakeen karte hai
 Nostradamus's prediction about Diana's death, the rise of dictator Adolf Hitler, the atomic bomb, the Second World War, the 9 / 11 terrorist attack have proved absolutely accurate
 agar is saal parmaanu yuddh (tritiy vishwayuddh) shuru hone kii bhavishyavaanee sahi sabit hui, to maanav jivan bhi sankat main pad jayega

 He denied the allegations that the CBI in its charge sheet ignored the angle of terror in the case
 scindia ne bijepi ke is aarope ko bhi galat bataaya tha ki sibiai kendra sarkaar ke dabaav main bijepi ke netaaon ko nishaanaa bana rahi he
 In its charge sheet, the CBI has termed the Ishrat Jahan encounter as fake
 sibiai ne kaha he ki gujarat police or ibi kii rajya ikai ne mil kar is farji muthbhed ko anjaam diya
 The CBI has not said anything about whether Ishrat and the others killed in the encounter were terrorists

 During that time the picture was taken while going to see the film

 Zapper Literature Festival - typical locals say so
 baaki janata ke liye yah jaipur litarechar festival hi he
 Weekend Getaway for the elite people of Delhi, Chandigarh and surrounding cities
 janata jo volvo or ubar-ola se kahin bhi aati-jaati
 Seeing the condition of public transport, it would raise the slogan of social justice and feminism in such a watery eye
 kahin bhi jane se pehle vahaan ke hifai hotel search karti hui
 So this time we also did
 26 janvari - ganatantr diwas ke din naukari bajaane ke baad ham bhi weekend mod main the
 What is that, not a weekend job for the people working in metros? wo 5 din kaam hi isiilie karte hai ki do din kaa weekend paa saken
 Before: Before going to Gathajipur, the amazing prose of Nautanki asked a friend who went there to report, how are there sessions? The answer was okay
 hamane kaha- soch rahe chale aaen
 He said - Come away
 nahin to hamane weekend or compof jodate hue 4 din kii lambii chuttee jugadee thi
 Were to go home, but thanks to Indian Railways
 ham jane vaale the bihar or rajasthan pahunch gaye
 Well, we reached Jaipur in the morning by charging Rs 296 from Delhi
 sindhi camp bas stand
 From there, Ola reached the friend's house on the bike ride
 jaraa dur tha
 In another part of the city
 dost bhi rajya ke nami akhbaar kaa reporter he
 He also had to come there
 to uske ghar par nahaane-dhone ke baad skuti se saath hi chale aae
 According to him, the brightness of the lit fest is being worn away every time
 ham bole ki yaar hamane to pehle kabhi dekhi nahin
 Where they also work for 2 years
 vahaan ke jalson ko desk se hi cover kiya-dekha
 Such is the job
 aadmi bandamru ban jaataa he
 On the go, i had a look at the daily urban newspaper
 kuch padhaa or kuch chhot gaya
 By the time he reached there, Anurag Kashyap had launched the Hindi crime drama thriller writer Surendra Mohan Pathak's novel 'naa Baari Naa Koi Begana' from Hindi heartland (hindi belt)
 anuraag kashyap aajkal har jagah hai
 From our social media feeds to all the water
 ho saktaa he aisa unki haalia relies film kii vajah se ho, magar aisa hi he
 The sun was at its peak by the time we arrived at the prom
 jaipur main dilli jaisi thand nahin
 The sun shone too
 jalse kaa sthaan diggi pales
 On reaching the venue of the prom, it was found that in the biggest stage 'charbagh', Shashi Tharoor is involved in a panel discussion on some issue
 jitani janata siton par jami hui
 Almost as much people were engaged in trying to hear and see something from outside the pandal
 chunki suraj apane charam par tha or baaki kaa kaam vahaan kii janata kar rahi thi
 People rubbing their bodies apane pairon se dhurra udaati janata
 Anwar Jalalpuri: The one who promised that we failed to listen for long after we entered the hall of books
 haul main daakhil to badi garmjoshi se hue ki dekhen ki kya sab he, lekin yahaan to maamla doosraa tha
 English books all around, and most of the same authors whose books were launched or are going to be in the prom
 thodi der main hi kaan ke peeche or maathe par pasinaa aane laga
 Chunchunni started becoming different
 jaldi se vahaan se bhaagna chaha tabhi tamaam angreji kii kitabon ke bich surendra mohan pathak kii kitaab dikh gai
 We also stilled
 surendra mohan pathak kii kitaaben bhi to pathakon ko kuch aise hi tham leti hai
 But here the matter was different
 yahaan unki kitaab waisi nahin jaise railway plateform, railway stesan ke baahar mastaram kii porn kitabon ke saath dikhti thi
 Printed on rough copy paper
 balki, penguin or jagarnott kii kitabon se takkar leti hui
 The quality of the paper is also very shocking
 man hi man sochaa ki jis surendra mohan pathak kii kitaaben is desh main sabase adhik padhi jaati rahi hai
 How the book written in Hindi by the same author is poor among English books
 jaise raajnneeti bhale hi raaj karne kii bhashaa ban gai ho lekin naukarshahi or abhijatya janon ke bich angreji hi grahya he
 Like Razia gets caught in goons

 Once pleased with the art of both, the king gave Madhvanal a necklace of his own
 madhavanal ne iskaa shrey kaamkandala ko dete hue vah haar usko pahana diya
 This made the king feel insulted and in a fit of anger drove Madhavanal out of the kingdom
 iske baavjood kaamkandala or madhavanal chhip-chhipakar milte rahe
 Once Madhavanal went to the shelter of King Vikramaditya of Ujjain and after winning his mind asked him to free Kamakandla from King Kamsen as a reward
 raja vikramaditya ne donon ke prem kii pariksha lee or donon ko khara paakar kaamkandala kii mukti ke liye pehle raja kamsen ke paas sandesh bhijwaya
 War erupted between the two when the king refused

 Both called for their presiding deity, Mahakala on one side and Bhagwati Vimala Maa on the other hand came to help their devotees

 mobile, telephone or internet sevaayen suspend hai
 The people there are not in contact with the outside world, they are not able to go anywhere
 wo puri tarah se buniyadi aapurti se vanchit hai
 On the other hand, the corporate media and the government's PR agencies keep spreading the lie that everything is normal in Kashmir

 The mps announced on Monday that they would send a letter to Sonia Gandhi today, stating her resignation and her reasons

 There is a reason for our resignation
 yah kaaran hamaari party or uske sheersh netaa hai
 Prabhakar pointed out that he had been loyal to the party from the beginning, but now he felt that he was being completely downplayed
 unhone kaha, yadi andhra pradesh main party kii sarkaar chal rahi to vah keval telugana ke vidhayakon ke kaaran
 They remain the party's loyalists, while they are also fighting for a separate state, but now we are forced to take drastic decisions

 imran khan ne pradarshnakariyon se piem awaas ke gheraav ke liye chalane kaa aahvaan kiya or kaha ki jab tab navaj sharif istipha nahin dete, tab tak ve date rahenge
 The protesters have come very close to the Pakistani Secretariat
 police va pradarshnakariyon ke bich hinsak jhadap main ab tak 7 logon ke maare jane kii khabar he
 Late night protesters reached extremely close to Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's house
 taahir-ul-kadri or imran khan kii aguwai main pradarshnkaree navaj sharif ke ghar kii taraf bad rahe hai
 The police released Gansu gas shells on the protesters
 police ne hawaii firing bhi kii, jisamen 7 pradarshnakariyon kii maut ho gai
 More than 300 protesters were also injured in this police action

 The government has called for the army to overcome the situation
 kareeb 100 pradarshnakariyon ko hiraasat main liya gaya he
 The protesters are constantly shouting 'azadi' and 'nawaz Jao'
 is bich jeeyo tivi ke offis par pradarshnakariyon ne hamalaa bol diya yahi nahin kuch logon ne lahore main bhi kai dukaanon main lutpaat kii
 a panic situation arose late night in the VIP area of islamabad when thousands of protesters with sticks broke the security cordon and marched towards Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's residence
 iske saath pradarshnakariyon or sarkaar ke bich 17 din se jari gatirodh ne nayaa mode le liya
 The police opened fire, lathi-charged and released tear gas shells led by Imran Khan and tahir-ul-qadri
 aadhi raat ke aasapaas islamabad main halaat bigadane lage jahaan badi sankhya main pradarshnkaree pradarshan sthal se hatane ko taiyaar nahin the
 As tension increased, Sharif left for Lahore
 der raat sarkaar kii taraf se kiye gaye elaan main sharif ke istife kii baat saaf taur par khaarij kar di gai
 The protesters started shouting slogans against Sharif and his government from the National Assembly towards the Prime Minister's residence
 isse kuch hi der pehle pakistan taharik-e-insaaf ke pramukh imran khan or pakistan avami taharik ke netaa kadri ne pradarshan sthal badalane kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 Before the protesters started their march, the Ministry of Home Affairs had announced that troops would be deployed to stop them
 imran or kadri donon sharif ke istife kii maang kar rahe hai
 Imran has been accused of rigging last year's general election
 imran ne kaha, ‘main pradhanmantri awaas tak march kii aguwai karanga
 All my supporters will be with me
 ’ unhone mahilaon or bacchon se kaha ki jab tak vah nahin kahen ve log ruke rahen or unke saath nahin aaen

 Film Name: Patel's Punjabi shaadidirector: Sanjay Chailstar Cast: Rishi Kapoor, Paresh Rawal, Prem Chopra, Veer Das, Payal Ghosh Fight but Pyaar Se 'is released
 shaadi antertenment par besd is film main paresh rawal or rishi kapur kii bade parde par vaapasi hui he
 In the name of the film 'patel's Punjabi Shaadi: Fight But Pyaar Se' it is clear that this film is a story of love and wrangling between a Patel and a Punjabi family
 is film ke riter diarector sanjay chil ne ek arase baad is film ke saath vaapasi kii he
 As its first director, he has directed films like Sundar and Maan Gaye mughal-e-azam
 aaie jane unki ye haalia relies 'patel kii punjabi shaadi' kisi film he
 
 
 Shilpa Shinde, who was expelled from Bhabi Ji Ghar Par Hain, returns from this item number In the film, Hansmukh Patel (paresh Rawal) lives in a Gujarati society in Mumbai with her mother, elder daughter and younger daughter Pooja Patel (payal Ghosh)
 hansmukh kii patni kaa dehanth ho jane ke baad wo betiyon ko akele paalate hue unhen kai niyamon or kanoonon main baandhe rakhata he
 Even he keeps on instigating the society to protect his Gujarati culture, in addition to Gujaratis in the society, Hasmukh has absolutely no choice
 kahani main twist tab aata he jab uske ghar ke saamne vaale bangale ko second hand kaaron kaa dealarguggi tandon (rishi kapur)kharidkar apni patni, pita prem tandon (prem chopra) or bete monti (vir das) ke saath vahaan aa jaataa he
 On one hand, Jolly's family is full of culture and on the other hand Guggi's family is completely cool and open-mouthed
 hansmukh apni beti ko unase bachakar rahane ko kahata he par monti or puja ko pehali najar main ek duusare se pyaar ho jaataa he, isi bich puja kii badi bahan kii sagaai ke dauraan tandon parivaar main kuch aisa ho jaataa he ki vah sagaai tut jaati he jisaki vajah se hansmukh or bhi zyada gusse main aa jaataa he
 After this, Guggi and Monty start correcting their mistake, now whether Monty and Pooja's love turns into marriage, you will know that by watching the film
 kamazor kadiyanfilm kaa trailradekhane ke baad to ye lag rahaa tha ki film thik-thaak hogi lekin puri film kii kahani kaaphi hili-duli he or script level par bahut sara kaam kiya janaa chahie tha
 The casting of the film is very good but due to the hitting of the screenplay the film looks weak
 gujarati or punjabi pariwaron ke bich kahani kaa taana-bana bahut hi badhiya ho saktaa tha

 Michael Hobbs, coach of the Indian hockey team, said that the members of the team selected for the Olympics are neither proud of history nor too excited about their prospects
 ve sirf jeet hasil karnaa chaahate hai
 Nobbs believes that occasional wins against top-5 teams are good, but India will have to beat these teams regularly to make their place in the Olympics
 nobs kii dekharekh main bharat ne asian champiens trophy jeetne ke baad champiens chalange main doosraa sthaan hasil kiya
 He then finished first in the Olympic qualifiers and third in the Azlan Shah hockey
 nobs ne kaha, 'hamaare khilaadi na to bahut adhik utsahit hai ki ve apana lakshya bhul jaaen or na hi apane svarnim itihaas ko lekar kisi tarah kii duvidha main hon
 It is very difficult to say which place India will stay in the Olympics
 ''hamaari taiyaari acchhee he or lagaataar jari he
 Our players are improving every day
 ham jeetne kaa lakshya lekar chal rahe hai or isi par apni ranneeti aadhaarit karnaa chaahate hai
 Nobbs believes that playing consistently against top teams such as Australia, Germany, Netherlands, Spain and Britain will help India maintain its archaic style when India used to be a head of hockey
 nobs bole, 'hamane sheersh-5 tiimon ke khilaaf jeet hasil kii he, lekin ham niyamit taur par aisa nahin kar sake hai
 We have to play against these teams continuously and win continuously because this will improve our standard
 ' Former Tehelka editor-in-chief Tarun Tejpal, arrested on charges of rape, was arrested by Goa Police on Saturday night
 tejpal par mahila sahakarmi ne rape ke aarope lagaae hai
 Tejpal's arrest comes nearly 10 days after the allegations surfaced
 tejpal-police ke bich khatm hua chuuhe-billi kaa kheldistric and seshans jaj anuja prabhudesai ne tejpal kii agrim jamaanat kii arji ko khaarij kar diya
 90 minutes later, his cat-and-mouse game with the police came to an end
 tejpal kii agrim jamaanat arji par do dinon se bahes jari thi
 The prosecution side strongly opposed the bail application of Tejpal
 jaj ke faisle kaa byoraa aana abhi baaki he
 Tejpal was arrested from the Goa Crime Branch office after the anticipatory bail application was rejected
 giraftaar ke baad unhen medical chekup ke liye le jaaya gaya
 a three-and-a-half-hour delay in arriving at the verdict, 50-year-old Tehelka founder Tejpal was formally arrested in the Crime Branch office in Dona Paula
 krime branch ke daftar main tejpal apane parijan ke saath court ke faisle kaa intjaar kar rahe the
 The court had said that it would give its verdict on Tejpal's anticipatory bail application at 4:30 pm, however, it was delayed by about three and a half hours
 raat main 8:15 baje faisla aayaa
 Tejpaltejpal, who was escaping from Delhi and Goa police, came out of the police station after his wife, daughter, brother and his friend Sanjay Roy were arrested
 tejpal ko jaruri medical jaanch ke liye le jaaya jayega
 Tejpal, known for conducting investigative journalism through sting operations, was not coming to the Goa and Delhi police
 police ne shuukravaar tadake dilli main tejpal ke awaas par chhapemari bhi kii thi
 Tejpal came to Goa after being given interim relief by a sessions judge
 agrim jamaanat par aakhri faisla aane tak tejpal ko giraftaar nahin kiya ja saktaa tha
 The matter came to light on 20 November
 
 
 yah puraa maamla 20 november ko us vakt saamne aayaa jab tejpal ne khud sweekaar kiya ki unhone mahila patrkaar se 'rduvyavahaar' kiya tha
 Tejpal also said in his apology that he was dissociating himself from his post for six months
 maamla saamne aane ke baad tejpal ke rukh main baar-baar badlaav aata rahaa
 Tejpal later also claimed that whatever happened to the female journalist was by mutual consent
 unhone peedita kii nishtha par bhi sawaal uthaae
 The victim alleged that Tejpal tried to sexually assault her twice in a lift of a five-star hotel during a 'tehelka' program held in Goa earlier this month
 hiraasat main ghar kaa bana khaanaa kha sakenge tejpaljaj prabhudesai ne prosicution or bachaav paksh kii daleelein sunne ke baad tejpal kii agrim jamaanat arji khaarij kar di
 The prosecution opposed Tejpal's bail, saying that it was necessary to interrogate him in custody as a rape case was made against him
 baharhaal, jaj ne tejpal ko is baat kii ijaajat di ki agar unhen hiraasat main le liya jaataa he to poochtacha ke dauraan yadi vah chahen to din main ek baar kuch samay ke liye apane vakil kii madad le sakate hai
 Tejpal will also be allowed to eat homemade food
 tejpal par lageen ye dharaaen
 
 
 Tejpal's lawyer Geeta Luthra said that they would not challenge the Sessions court order yet
 court kaa faisla aane se pehle hi tejpal krime branch ke daftar main maujuud the
 The judge reserved his decision for 4:30 in the morning
 baharhaal, faisla aakhirkaar raat 8:15 baje sunaaya gaya
 The Goa police has registered a case against Tejpal for hostage raping - Section 354 (A) and hurting the dignity of a woman journalist - Section 376 (K)
 kam se kam 10 saal ke liye jail ja sakate hai tejpassagar tejpal ko is maamle main doshi qaraar diya jaataa he to unhen kam se kam 10 saal kii jail or zyada se zyada umrakaid kii sajaa sunai ja sakati he
 Government lawyer Suresh Lotlikar argued that Tejpal should be sent to police custody so that he could be properly questioned
 suresh ne kaha ki tejpal apana bayaan baar-baar badalte rahe hai or ab daawa kar rahe hai ki unka paksh suna nahin gaya
 'tejpal changes color like chameleon' Suresh Lotlikar told Judge Prabhudesai, 'the accused are changing colors like a chameleon from their different statements
 ’ suresh ne kaha ki is maheene kii shuruyaat main goa ke jis hotel main ghatana hui, vahaan kii sisitivi footage rape ke aarope kii pushti ke paryaapt sanket detii he
 'tejpal has already threatened the victim's family' The government lawyer also argued that Tejpal was not appearing before the Goa police and he appeared only after getting interim relief from the court on Friday
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki tejpal ne shikayatakarta ke parivaar par dabaav banane kii bhi koshish kii thi
 He referred to the FIR lodged in Delhi in this regard
 'apane bayanon par kaayam rahi he peedita'vakil ne kaha ki aaropee ke pehle ke aacharan se is baat ko bal miltaa he ki vah jaanch main dakhal de rahe hai
 He said that the victim has been firm in her statements
 tejpal par phenkaa kaala jhanda
 
 
 Meanwhile, a man threw a black flag at Tejpal while he was in court but he entered the car which did not hit the flag

 Do you also feel that while you are thinking about taking this relationship a step further, your partner is completely calm about this matter? Do you feel that your partner is more than you Too careless about a relationship? If yes, it is a matter of concern for you
 par ye baat sau fisadi sahi ho aisa bhi nahin kyonki aksar ladke aise maamalon main samay lete hai
 Maybe while you want to take this relationship forward, your partner does not see this relationship from that perspective
 agar aapako bhi apane partner kii manshaa par shaq he yaa phir aapako uskaa vyavhaar samaj nahin aa rahaa he to aap in chaar lakshanon se uske man main chal rahi baat kaa andaja laga sakate hai
 1
 aap donon ke alaava kisi tisare ko is baat kaa pataa na hona ki aap donon ek-duusare ko date kar rahe habgar aap donon ke bich kaa sambandh vaaki gambhir he to aapke partner ne nishchit rup se aapako apane parivaar waalon or doston se milwaaya hoga
 But if he has not done so yet, then there must be something wrong
 agar vah aapako ab bhi dost bataakar hi logon se milwataa he to aise main aapke liye jaruri he ki aap sachet ho jaaen
 2
 kya aapkaa partner bhi rahete-rahete kahin kho jaataa he or phir khud hi laut aata haijab bhi aap kahin ghoomane jane kii yojana banaate hai to kya aapkaa partner bhi aapako usamen shaamil na ho paane ke kaaran ginane lag jaataa he? kya aapke kai massej karne ke baad bhi wo aapako jawaab nahin detaa he? yaphir aapke phone kol kaa wo ek yaa do din baad hi jawaab detaa he? agar haa, to ye sthiti kisi bhi rup main sahi nahin he
 Does it also happen to you that your partner suddenly becomes very emotional towards you and someday suddenly disappears without telling you? If something similar is going on in your relationship, then it is time for you to be careful
 3
 Does your partner hesitate to meet you in a public place or does your partner immediately agree to meet you at home but when you call him at a hotel or public place, he gets annoyed? If yes, So do not be late to understand that he does not look at this relationship seriously
 4
 When talking about future plans, when two people are sincerely in a relationship and think about taking it forward, they have many things and ideas about future plans
 par agar aapkaa partner bhavishya kii yojanaon ko lekar aapse baat karne main bhi ruchi nahin rakhata he to yah samaj lijie ki usase alag ho jane main hi aapaki bhalaai he

 These two, however, cannot even enter where decisions are made as to who should be the president and who should resign
 ’unka sanket sangh parivaar ke sheersh sanghathan rashtriya swayamsevak sangh kii ore tha jisaki baat aise ahm muddon main antim maani jaati he

 shram mantralay ke prastaav ko agar sweekaar kiya gaya to desh main naukariyon ke aankadon main kaaphi tej badhat hogi
 Before the 2019 elections, the government can try to impress young voters by pinking the figures on this front

 Which is not included in the figures
 haalanki, piem modi ke is bayaan par soshal media yugers se lekar vipakshi dalon tak ne nishaanaa saadhaa tha
 According to the news of the Economic Times, the Ministry of Labor is preparing to include the employment seekers under the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) in the records of those who have got jobs
 rojgaar ke morche par aalochana kaa shikaar ho rahe sarkaar ke varisht mantri lagaataar yah kehete rahe hai ki PMMY ke tahat badi sankhya main yuvaaon ko lone or rojgaar mila he, to use bhala job ke aankadon main kyon na shaamil kiya jaae
 PM Modi himself has mentioned in an interview given to a TV channel the example of employment in the informal sector with the example of a pakoda seller
 haal main jari ek sarkari aankade main bataaya gaya tha ki is vitt varsh main 55 lakh log ipiefo ke network se judenge, jisase yah sabit hota he ki naukariyon main acchhee badhat ho rahi he

 Soon after this brief meeting, talk started on the Saraswati river
 meri nazar us khet par thi jahaan khudaai ke baad mitti ke chote se tile ban gaye the
 Someone was looking for a board, which says that excavation work is going on to explore the Saraswati river
 is ummid main ki puratatvavidon kii team chalati-phirti dikh jaaegi, jinke haathon main kuch aujaar honge or sir par topi
 Did not see anything like this
 ek baar ke liye laga ki ham kahaan aa gaye hai
 Digging to the width of the small canal and the depth to which i drowned
 professor choudhary ne bataaya ki chalis se adhik gaanvon main aisi khudaai chal rahi he
 The government has given a budget of 50 crores and this work is being done under MNREGA
 jis manaregaa ko band karne kii baat kii jaati he usee manaregaa ke tahat hamaare maanas or itihaas main ek band padi nadi kii talash ho rahi he
 My ears got tickled as soon as i heard it
 aisa pehali baar suna tha, isliye pehali baar kaanon main gudagudi hui
 Archaeological or geological excavation, of course, would not have happened in such a way that the employment guaranteed dug out and later the geologists came and took the sample
 saamaanon ke milane or khudaai ke har charan or str ko darj karne ke kuch niyam kanoon to hote hi honge
 In the past two hundred years of written history, there is a debate about whether Saraswati is present or not
 afghanistan, pakistan, rajasthan, haryana or uttar pradesh main saraswati ke milane ke daawey kiye jate rahe hai
 There is a Saraswati in the mythology from the Rigveda, but it has not been able to claim exactly where it has been flowing on the ground
 saraswati vishalkay nadi thi yaa koi choti nadi rahi hogi, is par bhi bahes he
 In this country where a river has twenty names in the same area, several rivers named Saraswati have been found in the same country
 yahi nahin saraswati naam ke bhi anek matlab milte hai
 There is no account of how many rivers have become extinct and dried up during the time we spent two hundred years in finding the Saraswati
 saraswati kitabon or qaagazon main khoji ja chuki he
 Sometimes science becomes mythology then Left vs
 Union
 kaagazon par jo vivaad he usamen saraswati ke samarthak kabhi use kuccha ke ran kii taraf baha le jate hai to kabhi elahabaad ke sangam kii taraf
 Sometimes she comes descending from the Himalayas, sometimes becomes a rainy river and goes to Pakistan joining another river
 yah bhi ek tathy he ki dilli main sarkaar badalte hi saraswati bhi badal jaati he
 It happens by not being and not by being
 isliye iske hone ke pramaan par main tippanee nahin kar rahaa hum
 i am talking about the land of Mughalwali village in Haryana on which Saraswati claims to meet
 sarpanch manaregaa ke tahat khudaai kar rahe hai or saath main bonus ke taur par ek nadi ke milane kaa pramaan bhi mil rahaa he
 All this is a claim of a department and a government
 sataha se itani kam gaharaai par nadi hone kaa pramaan mil hi saktaa he yaa nahin mil saktaa he, yah daawa to nahin kar saktaa
 But what is surprising to find water on less excavation in the area which is full of rivers
 kya ye saraswati nadi he
 Professor Chaudhary's answer was very interesting
 unhone kaha ki saraswati nadi nahin he kaa yahi jawaab he ki yah saraswati nadi he
 i did not believe Professor Chaudhary's geological claims, but due to limited ability, he kept questioning with an intuitive intelligence and he kept telling me authentically
 ab unki baat kii tasdik koi bhugarbha shastri hi kar saktaa he
 Showing the evidence of the stream of the river below the wall built by the excavation from the hoe, Professor Chaudhary said that its direction is from south of Haryana towards Kutch i
e
 west of Gujarat
 unhone dhara ke nishaan ke neeche chattaanon ke kan kii ek patali peti bhi dikhaai ki isse pataa chalata he ki yahaan nadi bahati thi
 The age of these particles remains to be evaluated
 meri ricarding hone ke baad professor choudhary kii team sample lene lagi
 The direction has been given from these streams of sand, but what will be the age of the stream which is only six feet below, is also a matter of investigation
 shaayad
 Now, if there is no confluence Saraswati, then the Allahabad existence of Ganga Jamuna Saraswati, recorded in folklore, beliefs and mythological literature, is either rejected or is under question
 yani ab sab kuch bhugarbheey pramaan se sabit hona he
 Professor Chaudhary is giving proof of the existence of Saraswati on the basis of direction but not claiming that it is Saraswati
 das foot neeche kii sataha par mili pani ko dikhaa rahe hai ki yah nadi ke hone kaa pramaan he
 How would it be known that the water is of Saraswati? It got different answers and every answer gave way to a question
 ham kaise maan len yamunagar se haryana ke pashchim kii taraf se saraswati hi bahati hogi, koi or nadi nahin
 a river originated from the Aravalli in Delhi and met the Yamuna via Khan Market
 hamaare desh main nadiyon kaa rasta sirf himalay se nahin nilakata he
 It will happen when proved, but if it is Saraswati then it is a matter of national importance
 is site kaa vishesh taur par sangrakshan to hona hi chahie
 Professor Chaudhary told that less than one kilometer from the excavation site there is a Som river, whose water will be brought into this canal so that people feel that it is Saraswati
 lekin kya isse saraswati kii dhara ke aitihaasik pramaan nasht nahin ho jaaenge, to jawaab mila ki isse paryaton kaa vikaas hoga
 Employment will increase
 hazaron saal puraani nadi jis jagah mili ho kya koi bhi shikshit samaaj aisa karegaa ki usamen kisi or nadi kaa pani bhar de
 The comments kam se kam main yojana ke is paksh par sawaal to kar hi saktaa hum
 Are our tourists so naive that mixing the water of a rainy river in a nearby dug canal would make them understand Saraswati
 phir ham saraswati kaa talash hi kyon kar rahe the, un nadiyon ko bhi to saraswati maan sakate the jinhen ab bhi saraswati pukaara jaataa he
 If everything is for tourism and marketing, then we can also move the river in shopping bags in plastic bags
 aajkal har maal ke baahar plastic kaa ek talab banaaya jaataa he jisamen bachche car kii aakaar vaali naaven chalaate hai
 Professor Chaudhary said that Som river and Saraswati are tributaries
 som nadi saraswati kii poorak bhi ho sakati he
 i did not see any river coming from the same direction and running so close together
 jabaki donon kii duuri ek kimi bhi nahin he
 Shouldn't it be proved that water is not found there due to the edge of Som where it is being connected to the direction of Saraswati after meeting
 kya yah nahin ho saktaa ki yah som nadi kaa hi ilaaka ho
 All this will be revealed when there is extensive research but it seems that everything is happening in a hurry
 sarkaar or ek vibhaag daawa kar jaldi hi us nishaan ko hameshaa ke liye mitaa denge, jise duniya saraswati ke maarg ke rup main dekhnaa chaahegi
 Is this how we want to spread scientific thinking 
 saraswati hone kii isse badi traasadee kya ho sakati he
 Digging to the width of the small canal and the depth to which i drowned
 professor choudhary ne bataaya ki chalis se adhik gaanvon main aisi khudaai chal rahi he
 The government has given a budget of 50 crores and this work is being done under MNREGA
 jis manaregaa ko band karne kii baat kii jaati he usee manaregaa ke tahat hamaare maanas or itihaas main ek band padi nadi kii talash ho rahi he
 My ears got tickled as soon as i heard it
 aisa pehali baar suna tha, isliye pehali baar kaanon main gudagudi hui
 Archaeological or geological excavation, of course, would not have happened in such a way that the employment guaranteed dug out and later the geologists came and took the sample
 saamaanon ke milane or khudaai ke har charan or str ko darj karne ke kuch niyam kanoon to hote hi honge
 In the past two hundred years of written history, there is a debate about whether Saraswati is present or not
 afghanistan, pakistan, rajasthan, haryana or uttar pradesh main saraswati ke milane ke daawey kiye jate rahe hai
 There is a Saraswati in the mythology from the Rigveda, but it has not been able to claim exactly where it has been flowing on the ground
 saraswati vishalkay nadi thi yaa koi choti nadi rahi hogi, is par bhi bahes he
 In this country where a river has twenty names in the same area, several rivers named Saraswati have been found in the same country
 yahi nahin saraswati naam ke bhi anek matlab milte hai
 There is no account of how many rivers have become extinct and dried up during the time we spent two hundred years in finding the Saraswati
 saraswati kitabon or qaagazon main khoji ja chuki he
 Sometimes science becomes mythology then Left vs
 Union
 kaagazon par jo vivaad he usamen saraswati ke samarthak kabhi use kuccha ke ran kii taraf baha le jate hai to kabhi elahabaad ke sangam kii taraf
 Sometimes she comes descending from the Himalayas, sometimes becomes a rainy river and goes to Pakistan joining another river
 yah bhi ek tathy he ki dilli main sarkaar badalte hi saraswati bhi badal jaati he
 It happens by not being and not by being
 isliye iske hone ke pramaan par main tippanee nahin kar rahaa hum
 i am talking about the land of Mughalwali village in Haryana on which Saraswati claims to meet
 sarpanch manaregaa ke tahat khudaai kar rahe hai or saath main bonus ke taur par ek nadi ke milane kaa pramaan bhi mil rahaa he
 All this is a claim of a department and a government
 sataha se itani kam gaharaai par nadi hone kaa pramaan mil hi saktaa he yaa nahin mil saktaa he, yah daawa to nahin kar saktaa
 But what is surprising to find water on less excavation in the area which is full of rivers
 kya ye saraswati nadi he
 Professor Chaudhary's answer was very interesting
 unhone kaha ki saraswati nadi nahin he kaa yahi jawaab he ki yah saraswati nadi he
 i did not believe Professor Chaudhary's geological claims, but due to limited ability, he kept questioning with an intuitive intelligence and he kept telling me authentically
 ab unki baat kii tasdik koi bhugarbha shastri hi kar saktaa he
 Showing the evidence of the stream of the river below the wall built by the excavation from the hoe, Professor Chaudhary said that its direction is from south of Haryana towards Kutch i
e
 west of Gujarat
 unhone dhara ke nishaan ke neeche chattaanon ke kan kii ek patali peti bhi dikhaai ki isse pataa chalata he ki yahaan nadi bahati thi
 The age of these particles remains to be evaluated
 meri ricarding hone ke baad professor choudhary kii team sample lene lagi
 The direction has been given from these streams of sand, but what will be the age of the stream which is only six feet below, is also a matter of investigation
 shaayad
 Now, if there is no confluence Saraswati, then the Allahabad existence of Ganga Jamuna Saraswati, recorded in folklore, beliefs and mythological literature, is either rejected or is under question
 yani ab sab kuch bhugarbheey pramaan se sabit hona he
 Professor Chaudhary is giving proof of the existence of Saraswati on the basis of direction but not claiming that it is Saraswati
 das foot neeche kii sataha par mili pani ko dikhaa rahe hai ki yah nadi ke hone kaa pramaan he
 How would it be known that the water is of Saraswati? It got different answers and every answer gave way to a question
 ham kaise maan len yamunagar se haryana ke pashchim kii taraf se saraswati hi bahati hogi, koi or nadi nahin
 a river originated from the Aravalli in Delhi and met the Yamuna via Khan Market
 hamaare desh main nadiyon kaa rasta sirf himalay se nahin nilakata he
 It will happen when proved, but if it is Saraswati then it is a matter of national importance
 is site kaa vishesh taur par sangrakshan to hona hi chahie
 Professor Chaudhary told that less than one kilometer from the excavation site there is a Som river, whose water will be brought into this canal so that people feel that it is Saraswati
 lekin kya isse saraswati kii dhara ke aitihaasik pramaan nasht nahin ho jaaenge, to jawaab mila ki isse paryaton kaa vikaas hoga
 Employment will increase
 hazaron saal puraani nadi jis jagah mili ho kya koi bhi shikshit samaaj aisa karegaa ki usamen kisi or nadi kaa pani bhar de

 Are our tourists so naive that mixing the water of a rainy river in a nearby dug canal would make them understand Saraswati
 phir ham saraswati kaa talash hi kyon kar rahe the, un nadiyon ko bhi to saraswati maan sakate the jinhen ab bhi saraswati pukaara jaataa he
 If everything is for tourism and marketing, then we can also move the river in shopping bags in plastic bags
 aajkal har maal ke baahar plastic kaa ek talab banaaya jaataa he jisamen bachche car kii aakaar vaali naaven chalaate hai
 Professor Chaudhary said that Som river and Saraswati are tributaries
 som nadi saraswati kii poorak bhi ho sakati he
 i did not see any river coming from the same direction and running so close together
 jabaki donon kii duuri ek kimi bhi nahin he
 Shouldn't it be proved that water is not found there due to the edge of Som where it is being connected to the direction of Saraswati after meeting
 kya yah nahin ho saktaa ki yah som nadi kaa hi ilaaka ho
 All this will be revealed when there is extensive research but it seems that everything is happening in a hurry
 sarkaar or ek vibhaag daawa kar jaldi hi us nishaan ko hameshaa ke liye mitaa denge, jise duniya saraswati ke maarg ke rup main dekhnaa chaahegi
 Is this how we want to spread scientific thinking
 saraswati hone kii isse badi traasadee kya ho sakati he
 Saraswati has been discovered in books and papers
 kabhi vigyaan banaam puraana ho jaataa he to vam banaam sangh
 In the controversy over the papers, Saraswati's supporters sometimes take her to the run of Kutch and sometimes to the confluence of Allahabad
 kabhi wo himalay se utarati chali aati he to kabhi barsaati nadi banakar kisi or nadi main milte hue pakistan chali jaati he
 It is also a fact that Saraswati also changes as the government changes in Delhi
 wo nahin hone se ho jaati he or hone se nahin ho jaati he
 So, i am not commenting on the proof of its existence
 haryana ke mughalawali gaanv kii jis zamin par saraswati ke milane ke daawey kiye ja rahe hai, uski baat kar rahaa hum
 The sarpanches are digging under the MNREGA and together with the evidence of the founding of a river as a bonus
 yah sab ek vibhaag or ek sarkaar kaa daawa he
 At such a depth from the surface, there is no evidence that the river can be found or can not be found
 lekin jo ilaaka nadiyon se bharaa ho vahaan kam khudaai par pani milanaa kya achraj
 Is this Saraswati river? professor choudhary kaa jawaab bahut rochak laga
 He said that there is no Saraswati river, the answer is that it is Saraswati river
 mujhe professor choudhary ke bhugarbheey daavon par yakeen to nahin hua lekin simit yogyata ke kaaran sahaj buddhi se hi sawaal karata rahaa or ve mujhe pramanik taur par bataate rahe
 Now only a geologist can confirm his point
 kudaal se hui khudaai se jo diwaar bani he uske neeche nadi kii dhara ke pramaan dikhaate hue professor choudhary ne kaha ki isaki disha haryana ke dakshin se gujarat ke kuccha yani pashchim kii taraf he
 He also showed a thin plate of rock particles under the stream that shows that the river flowed here
 in kanon kii umr kya he iskaa moolyankan hona baaki he
 After my recording, Professor Chaudhary's team started taking samples
 ret kii in dhara se disha to bataa di gai he magar maatr chah feet neeche jo dhara ke nishaan he unki umr kya hogi yah bhi jaanch kaa vishay he
 Maybe
 ab agar sangam vaali saraswati nahin he to phir lokkathaon, aasthaaon or puranic saahitiyon main darj ganga jamuna saraswati kaa elahabaadiya astitv yaa to khaarij ho jaataa he yaa sawaalon ke ghere main aa jaataa he
 That is, everything has to be proved by geological evidence now
 professor choudhary disha ke aadhaar par saraswati ke hone kaa pramaan de rahe hai magar daawey se nahin kah rahe ki yah saraswati hi he
 The water found on the surface ten feet below shows that it is a proof of the river
 pani saraswati kaa he yah kaise pataa chalegaa iskaa alag-alag jawaab mila or har jawaab se ek sawaal kii guzaaish kaa rasta nikalne laga
 How can we assume that Saraswati will flow from Yamunagar on the west side of Haryana, not any other river
 dilli main aravali se ek nadi nikalati thi jo khan market hote hue yamuna main milti thi
 The way of rivers in our country is not just through the Himalayas
 jab sabit hoga tab hoga, lekin agar yah saraswati he to yah rashtriya mahatv kaa vishay to he hi
 This site must be specially protected
 professor choudhary ne bataaya ki khudaai kii site se ek kilometre se bhi kam kii duuri par ek som nadi he, jiskaa pani is nahar main laayaa jayega taaki logon ko lage ki yah saraswati he
 But will it not destroy the historical evidence of the Saraswati stream, then the answer is that it will develop tourism
 rojgaar badhegaa
 The place where thousands of years old river has been found, will any educated society do it to fill the water of another river in it
 tippaniyan At least i can question this side of the plan
 kya hamaare paryatak itane bhole hai ki ek barsaati nadi ke pani ko paas main khodi gai nahar main mila dene se saraswati samaj baithenge
 Then why were we looking for Saraswati, even those rivers which could still be considered as Saraswati
 agar sab kuch paryaton or marcenting ke liye he to ham plastic ke bag main nadi ko lekar shoping maal main bhi to ghuma sakate hai
 Nowadays a plastic pond is made out of every cargo in which children ride car shaped boats
 professor choudhary ne kaha ki som nadi or saraswati sahaayak nadiyaan hai
 Som river can also complement Saraswati
 maine aisi koi nadi nahin dekhi jo ek hi disha se bahati hui aa rahi ho or itane paas-paas se chal rahi hon
 While the distance of both is not even one km
 kya yah sabit nahin kiya janaa chahie ki kahin som ke kinare ke hone ke kaaran hi vahaan pani to nahin mila, jahaan milane ke baad saraswati kii disha se joda ja rahaa he
 Can it not be that it is the area of the river Som? yah sab to tab saamne aayega jab vyapak shodh honge lekin aisa lagata he ki sab kuch jaldi main ho rahaa he
 The government and a department will soon clear the trail, which the world would like to see as the path of Saraswati
 kya isi tarah ham vaigyanik soch kaa prasar karnaa chaahate hai
 What could be a bigger tragedy than being a Saraswati
 isliye iske hone ke pramaan par main tippanee nahin kar rahaa hum
 i am talking about the land of Mughalwali village in Haryana on which Saraswati claims to meet
 sarpanch manaregaa ke tahat khudaai kar rahe hai or saath main bonus ke taur par ek nadi ke milane kaa pramaan bhi mil rahaa he
 All this is a claim of a department and a government

 Can it not be that it is the area of the river Som? yah sab to tab saamne aayega jab vyapak shodh honge lekin aisa lagata he ki sab kuch jaldi main ho rahaa he

 Consumption is the mainstay of the growth of the Indian economy, as it contributes the largest in GDP, but its contribution has decreased in recent years
 shahari or gramin kshetron main girti mahangaai se yah sanket miltaa he ki in donon ilaakon main maang main kami aa rahi he

 Concerns of low inflation The declining inflation in urban and rural areas indicates that demand is declining in both these areas

 In FY 2019, it has reduced to just 0

 This is clearly a sign that agricultural income and wages are declining and it has deep implications for the economy, as nearly 50 percent of the country's workforce is dependent on the agricultural sector
 lagaataar giravat kaa yah rukh is baat kaa sanket detaa he ki mahangaai par waar kuch zyada hi ho gaya
 This has been pointed out in the Economic Survey 2018-19

 Consumer confidence is also declining, according to the Reserve Bank's Bilateral Consumer Survey of July 2019, the general economic outlook and the concept of current and future spending are quite blurred
 yah is baat kaa sanket he ki aay badhane ke bare main pariwaron kaa bharosa kam ho rahaa he
 All this indicates that the economic slowdown is widespread and the need to increase income and investment is necessary to bring consumption back on track, rather than gradual measures but a holistic approach is needed

 This was especially true if a criminal incident such as a white murder or rape took place
 shwet abhiyojak, shwet jaj or juri ke shwet sadsy aksar yah sweekaar karte the ki saboot naakaafi hai, yahaan tak ki ve virodhabhasi bhi the, lekin jis bahusankhyak shwet samudaay se ve aate the, uske prati nyaay kii vyapak bhaavana kaa hawala dete hue ve apane faisle kaa bachaav kar liya karte the
 The Supreme Court of India decision regarding the disputed site of Babri Masjid seems to explain the Hindu majority sentiments in the same way
 vivaadit kshetra ke aath shatabdiyon ke upyog se jude baari-bharkam sakshya kisi spasht nishkarsh par pahunchane main madadgaar nahin hue or is lambii kahani main kai virodhabhas hai, jisamen kanoon kaa khuleam ulanghan bhi shaamil he, jisane is vivaad ko janm diya
 However, the court ruled on the basis of 'balance of probabilities' that the 'claims of Hindus' had more validity than Muslims
 puure faisle ke dauraan nyaayadhish sabhi prakaar ke sanvaidhanik siddhanton, tathyon or saakshyon kaa sookshmata se ullekh karte rahe lekin ant main is baat par aa gaye ki kis pakshakaar ne is sthaan kaa 'nirbaadh upyog' dastaveji taur par sthapit kiya
 The court said that the Muslims' uninterrupted use of the site was disrupted due to two illegal acts
 pehla, 1949 main babari masjid main ramalala kii murtiyon kii sthapana or doosraa 1992 main dhaanche ko giraaya janaa
 Nevertheless, this lapse in 70 years in 'uninterrupted use' turns into an evidence that goes against the claims of Muslims at this site
 yah mahatvapurn kadam 'peedit ko hi doshi tehraane' jaisaa he
 This means that this judgment is hardly recorded as a great judgment in the books of jurisprudence
 iske bajaae, yah adaalat ke us samudaay ke prati nyaay kii bhaavana kii alag vyakhya ke anusaar kaam karne kaa ek bada spasht udhaaharan he jisaki seva adaalat kar rahi he
 Who is this community and what is it? First of all there is a re-elected majority government and a huge army of its supporters and activists who have moved from the 1980s to the power and political majority claiming that the disputed site is actually It is the birthplace of Lord Rama and Muslims demolished the temple and built the Babri Masjid over it
 unka yah kahana he ki yah aasthaa se judaa prashn he or ise kisi bhi tarah ke saakshyon se badla nahin ja saktaa
 For example, the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) found that in the case of Babri Masjid, no evidence of demolition of a Hindu temple was built on it
 duusare, adaalat puure faisle main 'hinduon' naamak ek shrenee ko darshaati he
 It is the same as the local groups who were allowed by the British to use the outer courtyard of the complex in 1856, and those who installed the statues in the mosque in 1949, and those organizations belonging to the RSS since the 1980s
 They are hovering around the site, they actually represent a genuine and common 'hindu' interest, keep the voice of the majority aside
 jis kisi ne bhi aresas or uske sanghathanon ke vikaas ko samajha-janaa he, unhen pataa hoga ki ve har jagah hinduon ke pramanik pratinidhi ke rup main apane ko sweekaar karwaanaa chaahate hai
 Now many people will start to believe that this claim has got legal support
 aakhirkaar adaalat ne apane soch-vichaar main saaf taur par 'saarvajanik rup se aman-chaiyn' kii bahaali ko ahmiyat di
 The deployment of thousands of security personnel indicated that the government did not want to take any risk
 haalanki is lambey vivaad main saarvajanik vyavastha par vaastavik khatre kii shuruyaat kabhi alpsankhyak samudaay ke sadasyon kii ore se hoti nahin dekhi gai he
 The danger in this case has been feared by the organized militant Hindu groups which provoked controversy in 1949, destroyed the Babri Masjid and campaigned for the construction of a temple at the site
 in samoohon se hi bade paimaane par hinsa kaa vaastavik khatra rahaa he jinka is sarkaar ke saath bahut kareebi rishta rahaa he or adaalat ne puure vivaadit kshetra par un logon kaa adhikaar sweekaar kar liya he jo 'hinduon' kaa pratinidhitiv karne kaa daawa karte hai
 Defenders of the verdict will point out that in cases where political stakes are large, interpretation of public mood and assessment of political justification is unavoidable
 ve yah bhi daawa kar sakate hai ki yah ek vyaavhaarik or nishpaksh faisla he, jo jameen ke masale ko hal karke saare vivaadon kii jad ko hi khatm kar degaa, saath hi is tippanee ke jariye ki muslim samudaay ke saath kuch maamalon main jyaadati hui he, isliye faisle main sarkaar ko nirdesh bhi de diya gaya he naa ki uski evaj main musalamaanon ko ek masjid ke nirmaan ke liye vah jameen muhaiyaa kare
 However, it is a bizarre decision in favor of the majority on the lines of 'sara Haq Winner Ka', which comes with some consolation prizes (but cheaply) for them, given the hurt feelings of the Muslim community

 The Supreme Court has laid the foundation for a new but extraordinary branch with a pluralistic view of jurisprudence, in which the evidence of religious and political obsession among Hindus remains loyal to their 'orthodox truth' and the danger hovering over 'public peace and harmony' is historic
 And twenty falls on the old tradition of legal facts

 @beingsalmankhan @saqibsaleem @iambobbydeol @ jacquelinef143 @remodsouza # race3a post shared by TIPS (@tips) on Nov 9, 2017 at 12:12 am PST uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri bane yogi adityanath gorakhpur ke prasiddh gorakhnath mandir ke mahant hai
 The Gaushala in this temple complex has about 350 cows brought from Gujarat and Haryana
 is gaushala kii dekhbhaal karne ke liye 15 care tekar he, jinamein se 14 hindu or ek musalmaan he
 The name of this Muslim youth is Maan Mohammed, who has been working in this cowshed for the last 10 years
 'aaj tak' se khaas baatcheet main maan mohammad ne kaha ki vah bhale hemusalmanho magar yogi adityanath ke is gaushala main use kabhi bhi bhedbhaav kaa saamana nahin karnaa padaa
 Maan Mohammad says that political opponents have made him a staunch Hindu leader to tarnish Yogi Adityanath's image
 gorakhnath mandir main hi pichley 40 varshon se mohammad yaccin ansaari naam kaa ek vyakti bhi apni sevaayen de rahaa he
 Yasin Ansari, now 62 years old, came to Gorakhnath Temple at the age of 22 and from 1977 to 1983 he worked as the cashier of the temple and after that as the supervisor of the buildings being built in the temple itself doing work
 in 40 varshon main yaccin ansaari ne mandir main sadhana bhawan, yatri nivas, sindhu sevashram, sanskrit viapeeth, aspataal, dukaane or paanch mandiron kaa nirmaan karaayaa
 Yasin Ansari says that Kiyogi Adityanath does not hate Muslims and would not have worked in the temple premises for the last 40 years if this had happened
 ansaari kaa kahana he ki vah yogi adityanath ke kamare se lekar un tamaam jagahon par ja saktaa he jahaan par yogi adityanath jate hai
 Ansari says that many times Yogi Adityanath has participated in marriage in his family
 aise hi kahani,gorakhnath mandirparisar main ek chudiyon kii dukaan chalaane vaale mustakeem or unki patni ajijunisha kii he
 Both of them have been running bangles shop in the temple premises for the last 35 years and they say that they have not faced any kind of trouble in so many years
 mustakeem kehete hai ki unhen kabhi bhi koi pareshaani hoti he to vah yogi adityanath ke janata darbar main apni fariyaad lekar pahunch jate hai or unki mushkil kaa turant hal nikaal diya jaataa he
 All these people coming from the Muslim society work in the same Gorakhnath temple where Yogi Adityanath lives and worship the same Yogi Adityanath whose image outside the temple is that of an anti-muslim and a staunch Hindu leader
 5 march kii raat he, raat ke saadhe gyaarah baje hai
 There is a lot of activity outside the SSC office located on Lodhi Road in Delhi

 Everyone is listening carefully to Yogendra Yadav associated with Swaraj India
 yogendra yadav inhen ekajute rahane kii salaah de rahe hai or apana samarthan inke prati jataa rahe hai
 By now you must have understood that the matter is about the protesting students who have been demonstrating for the last seven days in front of the Staff Selection Commission office located on Lodhi Road, Delhi

 There was a news on Sunday that the Staff Selection Commission has accepted the demand of the protesting students but these students believe that they have been cheated and their demands have not been accepted
 kair, raat ke baarah baj gaye hai
 The day has changed according to the calendar
 yogendra yadav apni baat kahkar ja chuke hai
 The restlessness is evident in these students who have been performing for the last several days
 bechaini, avsaad or gusse kii vajah se aapas mentu-tu-main-mainvaali sthiti utpann ho gai he
 But some of these students are also coming forward to intervene
 zyaadaatar log khadey ho gaye hai, kuch idhar-udhar tahal rahe hai
 Overall, the situation is the same as that of the youth across the country
 yah bhi kahana galat naa hoga ki apane-apane ghar-parivaar se dur dilli main rahakar sarkari naukari karne vaale in chaatro ke paas pradarshan karne, dharna dene yaa narebaazi karne kaa koi anubhav nahin he or ye parinaam ko lekar thode ghabaraae hue bhi hai
 They are most afraid of police action
 raat ke ek bajane ko hai
 Walking around shows how tired students are sleeping anywhere
 koi kaagaz ke gatte par soya he, kisi ne akhbaar bichaaya he or akhbaar hi odh liya he
 Some people are sleeping in the open on the middle road, while some have gone to the shore to take a tree
 kuch gahari neend main he to kuch oongh rahe hai, vahiin kuch log apane mobile par gaanaa sun rahe hai, news dekh rahe hai
 This is his sixth night in this way
 haa kuch log paas main baithkar raat kaa khaanaa bhi kha rahe hai, menu he-aalu kii sabzi or puri
 Today both these items are hot and some people are eating and eating, saying, 'hey, today is the party
 garam sabzi, garam puri’din ke samay bread, kelaa or parleji biscuit bantata he
 These people are looking after themselves, by making donations to each other
 raat main rukne waalon main zyaadaatar ladke hi hai, ek-do ladkiyaan hai jo paas main hi so rahi hai
 On talking, it came to know that the maximum problem here is of the toilet
 khaskar ladakiyon ke liye, isliye zyaadaatar ladkiyaan raat main chali jaati hai
 For the past several days, the MCD car has not even come to collect garbage, so there is a lot of dirt around
 aaj se sansad kaa satr bhi shuru ho rahaa he or in naujavaanon ko apane saansadon se bahut ummid he
 They are talking to each other, 'some MP will raise it
 aaj se sansad shuru ho rahaa he
 It should not happen that no one raises our issue
 ’dilli ke lodhi road par sthit karmchaaree chayan ayog ke daphtar ke aage date ye noujvaan chandani raat main ek saath kai sabaq le rahe hai
 They are being immersed in the trough of despair many times and only one of their companions is bringing them out of there
 wo netaaon ke prati avishvaas jataate hai lekin duusare hi pal aaj se shuru hone vaale sansad satr ko lekar ashanvit ho ja rahe hai
 They fear that the police sitting outside will come in any night and beat them out with sticks
 lekin ye is dar ko apane upar zyaada dar tak haaavee bhi nahin hone de rahe hai
 They assure themselves that if something like this happens this night and this moon will testify to them

 Do you have any opinion about GM food, bio-cultivated crops
 nahin he to koi baat nahin, magar is vivaad ko aap kisi pariktha kii tarah na dekhen to thik rahegaa
 Where someone comes from the moon and solve the problem from farming to farming to hunger
 duniya bhar main jiem food ko lekar anant vivaad hai
 Questions have been raised about the credibility of governments, sanctioning agencies, companies making GM food seeds
 you- tub par kai documentry mil jaaegi to kai vishwasaneey website par khub saare lekh
 For the moment we will be limited to a few questions for TV
 kya ji em food hamaare swasthya ke liye sahi he? Is GM a perfect solution to the problem of food farming? kya jiem food se kheti par corporate kaa kabza ho jayega? Who will control the price of GM food seeds? kya jiem food se hamaare kheton kii jaev vividhta samaapt ho jaaegi? Broadly the question of the impact on our health and the monopoly of companies over GM seeds is important
 ekadhikaar kaa matlab he ki aap beati chane kaa beej ek hi company se kharidenge or company tay karegi ki kitna daam hoga
 New seeds have to be purchased every year
 jaise abhi koi kitnashak dawa fail ho jaati he to kisaan companiyon se ye tak nahin puch paata ki aapane aisa daawa kyon kiya tha
 It is the same about seeds
 hamaare desh main in chizon par niyantran rakhane kii koi vishwasaneey sanstha tak nahin he
 One person said that if the government is satisfied that there should be GM food then why not ask its agricultural institutions like Pusa to produce GM seeds and distribute them to the farmers
 agar yahi samaadhaan he to sarkaar kyon nahin detii
