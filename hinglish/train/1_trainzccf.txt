 The Congress, which is going to face a tough electoral battle next year in Punjab, will not allow its current mlas to change seats from normal seats and strictly implement the 'one family, one ticket' formula
 iske tahat ek hi parivaar ke do logon ko chunaav ladane kii anumati nahin di jaaegi
 Punjab Congress President Amarinder Singh said, 'there will be no discussion on these rules
 hamane faisla kiya he ki saamaanya siton se sabhi vartmaan vidhayak apni-apni siton ko bachaaen
 They will not be allowed to change their seats
 ' He said, 'change of seat will be allowed only in case of 34 reserved seats
 saath hi ek parivaar, ek tikat kaa faisla antim hoga, ise nahin badla jayega
 He said that the remaining party tickets for Punjab were likely to be finalized by early next week, when the party's central election committee headed by Congress president Sonia Gandhi would meet

 ) My first sabka from Naipaul was at the age of seventeen, when my novel a Bend in the River suddenly collapsed in the 1980s in Dhaka, while sifting through my family's bookcase
 apni umr ke lihaaj se bangla sahitya to maine acha-khaasaa pard rakhaa tha, magar vishwa sahitya se meraa taaruf tab nayaa-nayaa hi tha
 i had met the writings of some classic writers — Tolstoy, Mopasan, (somerset) Mom and Hemingway — but i had not read much of my time
 is lihaaj se naypaul ke shuruaati lafj kaanch ko todatii eent kii tarah meri taraf aaeh "duniya jo he so he, aadmi jo kuch nahin hai, jo khud ko kuch nahin banane kii ijaajat dete hai, unki isamen koi jagah nahin he
 "it was such simplicity, frankness, and beteliness that i did not know that i could have expected it from literature
" us vakt tak sahitya mere liye puri tarah duusare logon, doordaraj ke bare main hua karata tha
 i wanted it to be about me as well
 vah kisi duusare jamaane yaa jagah kaa maaloom detaa tha—19veen sadi ke europea kuleen varg yaa gaanv-dehaat kaa bengali bhadralok—iske pehle ki vah kabhi meraa ho paata
 The realities of the unsophisticated new capital like Dhaka seemed to be very minor in terms of literary approach
 magar saleem kii rosemara kii jindagi ke maamoolipan or maamuli mahatvakankshaon main, mushkilon ke achaanak foot padane main naypaul ne is tarah pesh kii jo na keval makul thi balki saahitiyik vishay ke taur par behad jaruri thi
 Even decades later, in a time full of post-colonial writings, it is difficult to fathom the startling power and newness of Naipaul's early works
 naypaul ke aalochak daawa karenge ki nae vichaaron ke baavjood unhone apane kirdaaron se sahi saluk nahin kiya
 They were too astringent, too hateful
 unhone unhen us tarah nahin dikhaaya jaise ve dikhaai dena chaahate the
 He showed them as his colonial critics showed
 yah sab ek had tak sahi ho saktaa he, magar unhone jo hasil kiya, uski viratata or ahmiyat unki najar se chook jaati haih unhone pahachaanaa or sthapit kiya ki "adhpake'' bhi saahitiyik tavajjo ke hakdaar hai
 Prior to Naipaul, the post-colonial writers were known to recapitulate folklore, narrate the story of the townsfolk, or to write back memories of the colonies
 aaj bhi un par apni khaas up-samskruti kii jaankaree dene kaa dabaav he—chaahe vah achche aakhyaan kii shakl main ho yaa achche pravasi ke taur par
 Naipaul was the first person to break out of this kind of restrictions and create new cultures
 is baat kii ahmiyat kam he ki unhone kitna "sahi-sahi'' bayaan kiya; ahm baat yah he ki unhone vishay ke taur par samoochee duniya par apana daawa kiya—or style ke khalispan or baton ke nukilepan kii badaulat yah daawa unhone is tarah kiya ki duniya kii unki barambar yatraaon ko katai nazarandaaj nahin kiya ja saktaa
 His entire literary life can also be seen as a long process of making claims — and thus in some way or another — to be added
 africa or asia kii yatraaon ke baad ve apane kisse-kahaniyon or sahitya main bhi bahut aahista-aahista ek nae ghar ke kareeb aane lage the
 There were some false steps, such as Mr
 Stone and the Knights Companion
 phir landan ke ek kadam kareeb da mimic main ke saath
 Finally, The Enigma of Arrival, a formal mystery tale with which he finally laid claim to his chosen country, England
 ek ajanabi aa chukaa tha, jo vahaan ke mul bashindon ko unki barish kii khubi, dasturon ke anokhepan or is sabake bich khud ko paane ke betukepan ke bare main bataa rahaa tha
 Naipaul was not an easy person
 2016 main unhone dhaka lit fest ko apni maujuudagi se nawaja tha or yah unki aakhri saarvajanik shirkat thi
 Being one of its hosts, i got to know them a little bit
 ve yah jaanane ko utsuk rahete the ki vakt ke saath unka lekhan kaisaa sabit hoga
 He built a beautiful palace of words, which will stand the test of time

 dilachasp he ki gurdaspur ke espi salwinder kii mahindra eksyuvi ek janvari ko subah 11 baje airbase ke paas laavaaris haalat main mili thi
 Salvinder claims that he was abducted by the terrorists on 31 December

 jaanch adhikari ab yah pataa lagane kii koshish kar rahe hai ki ye aatanki kahaan chhipe rahe or unhone hamalaa karne main aakhir itani der kis vajah se kii

 Investigation has revealed that the airbase flashlight was not working that night

 It is being told that the NIA has taken this decision because of their constantly changing statements

 Ever since Salvinder's claim of being abducted in this attack, his role has been questioned
 a post shared by Anjana Singh (@anjana_singh_) on Aug 26, 2018 at 10:39pm PDT The Union Home Ministry has rejected the mercy petitions of the five death row convicts

 After the incident took place outside Delhi's CM Arvind Kejriwal's house, on Tuesday, Delhi BJP President Manoj Tiwari has given a new challenge to CM Kejriwal
 manoj tiwari ne arvind kejariwal ko ramlila maidan main aakar khuli bahes karne kii chunauti di he
 Tiwari has said that if Kejriwal is really telling the truth on the issue of sealing, then he should come to Ramlila Maidan and debate with him in the open
 aapako bataa den ki mangalvaar ko hi siem kejariwal ne aarope lagaaya tha ki bijepi netaa media ke saamne charchaa karne se dar rahe hai or isliye bina baat kiye chale gaye
 Manoj Tiwari said that he has set the Ramlila grounds for Khulibhus and now Arvind Kejriwal just tell the date and time when he wants to argue
 manoj tiwari ne kaha ki agar iske baavjood kejariwal ramlila maidan nahin aana chaahate to wo jagah bhi khud tay karen, samay or taarikh bhi khud tay karen or bahes ke liye aaen
 Manoj Tiwari alleged that Kejriwal is also lying in this case that the MCD did not survey the roads
 tiwari ne kaha ki emsidi ne agar survey nahin kiya to kejariwal ko ye baat usee vaqt kyon yaad aayi jab bijepi netaaon kaa pratinidhimandal unase milane gaya or kyon nahin beete 3 saal se unhone is sambandh main kuch kyon nahin kiya
 The Delhi BJP president said that public will also be invited at Ramlila Maidan and then there will be milk of milk and water of water
 manoj tiwari ne kaha ki marpet kii is ghatana aurasiling par rokke maamle ko wo sansad main uthaaenge
 Talking to the Urban Development Minister, Delhi BJP President Manoj Tiwari, while talking to journalists at the Delhi BJP office Pant Marg, said that after the incident of the assault, he spoke to Union Urban Development Minister Hardeep Singh Puri
 tiwari ke mutabik unhone bharosa dilaayaa he ki jald hi wo ceiling ke masale par bada faisla kar sakate hai lekin wo faisla kya hoga ye manoj tiwari ne nahin bataaya
 Tiwari said that in the next day or two, the BJP leader and the mayor will visit the Delhi Lt
 Governor to discuss his house and discuss the ceilings
 babar sheron ke liye doosraa ashiana banane ke prastaav ne gujarat or madhya pradesh kii bhaajapa sarkaron ko ek-duusare ke khilaaf khadaa kar diya he
 Presently, the Gir Sanctuary of Gujarat is the only destination of the Babar lions
 gujarat nahin chahta ki madhya pradesh main gwalior ke paas kuno-palpur abhayaarany main gir se kuch sher bhejkar nai singhbhumi banaai jaae
 In the 1990s, on the advice of the Wildlife Institute of India (WII), the central government decided to build a new shelter for lions
 vanya jivan ke liye kaam karne vaale gaiyr sarkari sanghathan (enjio)biodiversity conjarveshan trust kii yachika par yah maamla 1 may ko supreme court main sunwaayee ke liye pesh hua
 During the hearing, the Madhya Pradesh government termed Gujarat's allegations as stating that Madhya Pradesh forest officials are not capable of taking care of lions
 madhya pradesh ke ilaake main shikaar hota rahata he or vahaan itani jagah bhi nahin he ki sher shikaar kar saken
 The debate got further air when the Madhya Pradesh Tourism Department posted information on its website that "kuno has been selected as an alternative destination for the endangered Babur lions that have yet to fall in the Gir National Sanctuary of Gujarat
" Are found only in ''gujarat sarkaar kaa daawa he ki usne sheron ke sangrakshan ke liye paryaapt upaay kiye hai or unke liye doosraa thikaana talashna gaiyr jaruri he
 The number of lions in Gir has reached 411 and the state government, under its Greater Gir concept, has been able to increase the sanctuary to 400 sq km in the meadow and 1,400 sq km in forest area
 gujarat ke van adhikariyon kaa yah bhi kahana he ki gir main sakriy shikari madhya pradesh ke katni se aate hai, jo kuno-palpur se bahut dur nahin he
 This means that the proposed second location is not safe for lions
 gujarat main wanon ke pradhan mukhya sangrakshak pradeep khanna kehete hai, ''nishchit rup se sheron ko gujarat se baahar le jane kii koi jarurat nahin he
 This endangered species is safer here than anywhere else
 ''lekin unke ulat madhya pradesh ke van mantri sartaaj singh kehete hai, ''yah kahana galat hoga ki babar sher kuno-palpur main surakshit nahin rahenge
 Madhya Pradesh has well managed other national parks with tiger presence in the state
 gujarat ko yah baat samajni chahie ki is prajati ke achche bhavishya ke liye hi doosraa ashiana bananaa jaruri he
 "another forest officer from Gujarat reminds that the recommendation of the Wildlife Institute of India to send lions to kuno-palpur was a political decision as the Madhya Pradesh authorities were dominated by the institution at that time
 unhone kaha ki duusare thikaane kaa vichaar satahi he kyonki kuno-palpur kaa kshetrafal sirf 344 varg kilometre he or sifarish sirf chah sheron ke sthanantaran kii thi
 However, a
 je
 T
 jon singh jaise prakhyat vanya jivan visheshgyon kaa maananaa he ki babar sheron ke liye gir ke alaava koi doosraa thikaana talashna jaruri he
 "no one can ignore the efforts of the Gujarat government to save lions, but there is no limit to the untoward nature," he says
 1994 main tanzania ke serengeti neshnal park main paae jane vaale 4,000 sheron kaa ek chauthai hissaa kute se faili ek mahamari kii vajah se khatm ho gaya tha
 Serengeti is spread over 30,000 square kilometers, which is several times that of Gir
 doosraa thikaana talashne main hi samajhdaari he
 “the Government of Madhya Pradesh has added 700 square kilometers in the kuno-palpur sanctuary to keep more lions there
 lekin yah gujarat main chunaav kaa varsh he or gujarati 'gaurav' daanv par laga hua he, aise main sheron ko apane nae ashiyane ke liye or intjaar karnaa pad saktaa he

 a meeting of the committee constituted by the Ministry of Home Affairs on Wednesday has been called in North Block in New Delhi to implement Section 6 of the Assam Accord
 assam bhawan main is samiti ke sadsy press conference ko bhi sambodhit karenge
 The meeting has been called at 11 am
 vahiin dopaher 2 baje press conference kii jaaegi
 In order to properly and effectively implement Section 6 of the Assam Accord (assam Accord), which took place in the tenure of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in 1985, the Modi government in its first term decided to set up a high-level committee
 yah samiti isliye banaai gai thi kyonki assam samjhauta jitna prabhavi tareeke se lagu hona chahie tha, vaisaa nahin hua
 Significantly, there were agitations in Assam in the 80s to drive Bangladeshi infiltrators out of the state
 iskaa netritv akhil assam chaatr sangh (aasu) or assam gana parishad ne kiya
 As the movement grew, in August 1985, the 'assam Accord' was signed between the then Rajiv Gandhi government at the Center and the leaders of the movement
 rajeev gandhi ne avaidh bangladeshiyon se nijaat dilaane kaa vaada kiya
 The agreement said that Bangladeshis settled in Assam would be given citizenship by 25 March 1971
 baaki logon ko rajya se nirvasit kiya jayega
 In fact, Section 6 of the Assam Accord states that the central government will protect the culture, cultural heritage, social and linguistic identity of Assam at the constitutional, statutory and administrative levels

 Then what will be the total effect of all these three changes? How much will these changes affect you? It depends on how much your income is
 agar aapako selary nahin milti hai, maan lijie aap pensiondhari hai, to medical or transport alouns main badlaavon kaa aap par koi asar nahin hoga
 You will get a profit of 40 thousand rupees directly on taxable income
 haalankiiskaa laabh us vyakti ko milegaa, jisaki salanaa aay 10 lakh rupee se uparhai
 Including taxes and cess, a man will now have to pay tax of Rs 1 lakh 15 thousand eight hundred seventy five, according to the new provisions, a woman with an annual income above 10 lakh will now have to pay tax of Rs 1 lakh 8 thousand 680
 haalanki jaise-jaise aapaki aay badhegi, didction kaa laabh kam hota jayega or oonchi dar vaale ses kaa boj badhata jayega
 But if your annual income is above 47 lakh 85 thousand, then you will be hit by tax
 is chhot kaa phayda 2
 People with an annual non-salary income of 9 lakh will get more
 aise main 2
 Those with an annual non-salary income of Rs 9 lakh will have to pay 5 per cent income tax, which is around Rs 2,060 after the cess is added
 standard didction ke taur par milane vaali chhot ke baad aapako tex dendaree main kaaphi raahat mili he
 On the other hand, things have become very difficult for salaries
 jahaan, unhen 40,000 rupee ke standard didction kaa sidhaa phayda mil rahaa he, to unhen medical alouns (15,000) or transport alouns (19,200) par tex kaa bhugtan karnaa hoga
 In this case, his total profit on taxable income is Rs 5,800, which translates into a total savings of Rs 1,740 on taxable income
 kul milakar agar dekha jaae to sammanjanak selary par mil rahaa laabh gaun hi he
 If your income is 5 lakh rupees annually, then only 194 benefits you, but there is no benefit on the annual income of 12 lakh 62 thousand 400 (more than 1 lakh income per month)
 or bhavishya main bhi ye badhata hi jayega
 Although senior citizens have received some benefits
 udhaaharan ke liye tex free dipogits kii limit badha di gai he, jis par byaaj kii dar 8 pratishat he
 Now this 7
 5 lakh se 15 lakh ho gai he
 This means that you will now be able to add more than Rs 60,000 to the annual income from interest
 jo log apane bujurg mata-pita ke liye insurance lenaa chaahate hai, unke liye bhi jashn kaa mauka he
 The government will now give you the benefit of rebate at a premium of up to 50,000
 pehle yah seemaa 30,000 rupee thi
 That is, now you will be able to save Rs 6000 annually
 agar aap sidhe taur par equity main yaa mutual fund main nivesh karte hai to long turm capital gains tex dena padegaa
 Suppose you made a profit of Rs 2 lakh by selling the shares you bought a year ago
 aise main ab aapako 1 lakh se upar kii raashi par 10 pratishat sarkaar ko dena hoga
 That is, you have to give 10 thousand to the government on the amount of 1 lakh
 ab aap jitna zyada munafa kamaayenge, sarkaar ko utana zyada dena hoga
 The government has taken a small pity that if you have made some profit till 31 January 2018, then you will not have to pay any tax
 equity vaale mutual funds ko bhi ab 10 pratishat tex sarkaar ko dena hoga, us aay par jo ve aapako dete hai
 That is another shock
 lekin indiarect tex kaa kya? kya usase aapke kharche ghatenge
 Sadly, no, it will not happen
 sarkaar ne custom duty par 10 pratishat sarcharge laga diya he, matlab aaayaatit saamaan ab zyada mahange honge
 In such a situation, the price of Apple phone can increase up to Rs 5000, then 9
 3 lakh rupee kii hundai creta kii keemton main 70,000 rupee kaa oochaal aa saktaa he, jabaki audi aar8 10 lakh rupee tak mahangi ho sakati he

 Despite the installation of ESMA by the Madhya Pradesh government on Thursday 29 September, the junior doctors at Maharaja Yashwantrao Hospital remained on strike for the fourth consecutive day
 iske saath hi, unhone dhamkee di ki agar unki maangon kii andekhi kii gayi to unke saamne samuhik istife kaa vikalp khulaa he
 Around 300 junior doctors at MYH have been on strike since September 27 to protest the arrest of their partner on the beating of a hostess
 isse pradesh ke bade sarkari aspataalon main gine jane vaale aspataal main chikitsa or swasthya sevaayen buree tarah charmarai hui hai
 Akshay Gupta, president of the Indore Junior Doctors Association, said, "our strike will continue till the police arrest the hostess, Lokesh James, accused of beating junior doctor Raja Sheetalani
" vah ab tak khulaa kyon gum rahaa he
 Gupta said, "if our demands are not met then we will finally have to take the step of collective resignation
" ’unhone kaha ki aavashyak seva rakh-rakhaav adhinium (esma) kaa istemaal junior doctoron ke khilaaf nahin kiya ja saktaa kyonki ve medical vidhyaarthee hone ke naate ‘maandey’ par kaam karte hai or pradesh sarkaar ke ‘niyamit karmchaaree’ nahin hai
 Gupta said that if the junior doctors were taken action under ESMA, they would take shelter in the court
 punarjanm main agar aapkaa bharosa nahin he to nokia kii kahani pard lijie- yakeen ho jayega
 Nokia was once counted among the most trusted brands in the world
 lekin jab din kharaab hue to haalat ye ho gaye ki company kaa deewaala nikalate nikalate bachaa
 The company fired thousands of people, all the properties were sold, and then one day it came that the whole company was sold, bought by Microsoft
 kaha ja rahaa tha ki nokia ab dafan ho chukaa he or uskaa lautnaa mushkil he
 But Nokia has returned after sitting on the boat of Windows
 ye bahes to bahut puraani he ki agar nokia ne samay rahete andrid kaa daaman tham liya hota to aaj samsung, achatisi, micromax jaise brands mobile ke bazaar main hote hi nahin
 This story is also very interesting how Microsoft ruined the Nokia company earlier under a plot to buy cheaply
 lekin aaj ham aapako nokia company kii kahani ke bajaae ye bataate hai ki nokia ke vidos phone- jo nokia lumia kehalaate hai - aapako khareednaa chahie yaa nahin
 To say that Windows Phone also manufactures some other companies like HTC and Samsung
 lekin windos phone kii duniya main ab nokia lumia kaa hi sikaa chalata he
 So, we will only talk about that
 windos phone yani nokia lumia
 Buy windows phone only if -1
 aap bheed se alag dikhnaa chaahate hanhar kisi ke haath main andrid yaa blueberi kaa phone he
 Apple also wants to dominate the market by selling outdated models like iphone 4 in India cheaply
 aise main, nokia lumia ke behad khubasurat phone aapako ek alag pahchaan dete hai
 Nokia introduced us to mobile phones
 isliye, bharose ke maamle main koi iskaa muqabla hi nahin kar saktaa he
 If you want both beautiful and solid-looking then definitely look at Nokia Lumia phone
 kya aapane gaur kiya he ki zyaadaatar nokia lumia istemaal karne vaale log ise bina phone cover ke rakhte hai
 Whereas other phone buyers, along with buying mobile, hide it within the mobile cover
 kyonki jin logon ne nokia kaa phone ek baar bhi istemaal kiya he wo jaanate hai ki khilone ke plastic jaise dikhne vaale phones, majbootee ke maamle main iske saamne nahin tik sakate
 But with the tuff, Nokia Lumia phones run smooth like butter

 Wanting the most beautiful 'magic of tiles' can be a favorite, but there is no denying that the moment-changing tiles of Windows Phone look amazing
 'live tiles' or 'hub' windos phone kii jaan hai
 Tiles are those colorful squares appearing on the home screen of Windows Phone, where all the information, photos, by themselves, are updated live
 iske liye alag-alag aplikations ko kholane kii koi jarurat hi nahin
 Whether it is a missed call, an SMS, or the weather - the tiles keep presenting everything to you immediately
 isi tarah Hub bhi isliye banaaya gaya he ki aap jo kuch chaahate hai wo sab idhar-udhar khojane ke bajaay aapako sidhe ek saath, ek jagah par mil jaae- chaahe wo cheez aapke phone ke bheetar ho yaa online
 You can guess how great the 'tiles' and 'hub' look like by the fact that millions of people have downloaded the app created on its copy in Android phones so that their phone looks like Windows
 3
 Want good battery life and camera The biggest problem with smart phones is its battery
 kitna bhi manhagaa phone kharido, betry kaa ronaa laga hi rahata he
 Nokia Lumia phones are better in this case
 darasal, windos software is tarah se banaaya gaya he ki wo duusare phones ke mukaable kisi bhi kaam ko karne main kam power kharch karata he
 Similarly, for good photos, you can blindly trust the Nokia phone's camera - even in low light
 phone camera ke maamle main nokia lumia 1020 ko agar duusare phones kaa baap kaha jaae to galat nahin hoga
 41 megapixel sensor, Carl Zeiss Lens, 6 lens camera and many such features - which other phones will start to hear after listening
 kareeb 44 hajaar kaa nokia lumia to khayr photography ke diwaanon ke liye hi he lekin lumia ke duusare phones ke camere bhi aapako niraash nahin karenge
 4
 offis kaa kaam phone par niptaana honokia lumia ko chalaane vaala windos software vahi Microsoft company banaati he jiske banaae Microsoft Office par duniya bhar main offis kaa kaam-kaaj hota he
 Obviously, you will not be able to be friends with Windows Mobile phone with all the applications of Mircrosoft running on your computer
 search ke maamle main jo jalawaa google kaa he vahi offis aplikation ke maamle main Mircrosoft kaa he
 And in the case of Nokia Lumia, now everyone owns the same company, from the software of the phone to the hardware
 isliye offis ke compauter par choda gaya adhuraa kaam windos phone par puraa karnaa sabase aasaan he
 Not only this, in terms of security, Windows phones are much better than Android
 kaha jaataa he ki phone ke virus or malware kaa sabase bada adda hi andrid kaa Play Store he
 If we talk about the map, then the 'here' map of Nokia is amazing and the biggest thing is that it works well offline even without internet

 Want to enjoy smart phones at low cost, not that Nokia Lumia phones are cheap
 lekin ye baat pakke taur par kahi ja sakati he ki agar kam keemat vaala smart phone khareednaa ho to nokia lumia se behatar kuch bhi nahin he
 There are many reasons for this
 pehali baat to ye ki kam keemat vaale andrid phones main akasar aapako software kaa purana varjan milegaa or phone kharidte hi aap apane aap ko outdated mahasoos karenge
 kitkat 4, the latest version of any low-cost Android
 4
 2 hardly found
 lekin is maamle main nokia lumia laajawab he
 The Lumia 520 of Rs 8,000 is also running the same Windows 8 as the Lumia 1020 of 44 thousand
 duusari baat ye he ki andrid naam ke ingine ko chalaane ke liye zyada takat, zyada power chahie
 Low cost Android cheap processor, the phone runs on weak battery but by hitting it
 windos ke maamle main, garibi amiri kaa faasla kam pataa chalata he
 But before buying Windows Phone, also know-1
 phone ko chalaanaa siikhnaa padegakuch logon ko is baat par gussa aa saktaa he ki nokia lumia phone main maamuli sa kaam karne ke liye bhi khaasi maathapai kerani padati he
 For example, there is neither a drop-down menu on screen nor any other shortcut for turning on wi-fi, flight mode and Bluetooth
 andar settings main jaakar khojate raho! nae aadmi ko photo khinchne ke liye de do to batan hi khojataa rah jayega
 There is only one home screen on which you cannot do much of your choice except manipulating the tiles
 lock screen ke liye bhi koi shortkat nahin he
 And why did Bill Gates uncle forget to make a file manager in the phone? To see the files of the phone, every time the phone has to be connected to the computer, where is it wise? 2
 eps kii duniya yahaan luti-pity haiyahi wo baat he jahaan windos phone buree tarah pit jaataa he
 There is no apps on Windows for the work for which one to one apps are available on other phones for free
 kehane ko to windos phone ke liye bhi hajaaron eps hai
 But compared to the iphone and Android, poverty in the world of apps in Windows Phone has increased
 candi krash or temple ran jaisi chijen agar aapako khub pasand hai to windos phone bahut acchhee pasand nahin he
 512 MB RAM is now considered a shame in the world of Android, but Nokia Lumia is running it indiscriminately, which is not enough to play many games
 hairaani kii baat he ki yahaan to you-tub ke liye bhi dhang kaa koi ap nahin he
 If you have to go to the website and watch youtube, then what is the use of smart phones? The apps that are also, their quality is not comparable to the iphone and Android

 Friendship with Windows means hate with Google, you know that Android is the child of Google
 to google bhala kyon chahega ki koi uske bachche ke mukaable khadaa ho
 So if you are crazy about Google, then you will always realize that you are being treated half-heartedly on Windows Phone
 windos phone chahega ki aap search ke liye google ke bajaae Bing kaa istemaal karen
 Bing's photos may be excellent, he cannot compete with Google in search
 phir google map ho chaahe google Now, Youtube yaa phir Gmail- google kii duniya ke diwane hai to google ke phone, kii sharan main hi janaa behatar hoga- windos phone khariden to ye soch samaj kar
 4
 koun sa massej kahaan aayaa- khojate rahobahut se logon ko windos phone main notification kaa system uljhane vaala lag saktaa he
 Updating the information in the tiles looks stylish but is not convenient
 andrid main aap har tarah kii notification- jaise Facebook updates, Twitter, Whatsapp ke liye alag notification sound chun sakate hai, taaki aawaaj se hi samaj jaaen ki massej fasebuk par aayaa he yaa twitor par
 This is not possible in Windows
 isliye kai logon ko Whatsapp jaisi har samay kaam aane vaali sarvice kaa istemaal karnaa nokia lumia par jaraa mushkil lagata he
 If the volume of the song is lowered, the ringtone will also slow down
 ye kya baat hui bhai!5
 The fun of the video is less, here videos have so many files
 ki sabko chalaanaa kisi bhi phone ke liye mushkil he
 But this problem will be most common in Windows Phone
 kai tarah kii video files chalaa paanaa windos phone ke bas kii baat nahin
 Neither Windows Phone supports Flash Player nor is there a great app available in the App Store for playing videos
 yahi nahin, windos phone main bluetooth se video share karnaa bhi mushkil he

 On the 66th birth anniversary of Rajiv Gandhi, when the Gandhi family gathered at Delhi's Veerbhoomi to pay homage, people along with Rajiv started to remember Indira
 iske peeche vajah thi priyanka gandhi wadra
 Priyanka Gandhi's changed new hairstyle looks exactly like Indira Gandhi
 hindustan ke purv pradhanmantri rajeev gandhi kii 66 veen jayanti ke maukey par kamobesh puraa gandhi parivaar veerbhumi main shradhanjali ke liye maujuud tha
 Sonia was there, Rahul was also and Rajiv's daughter was Priyanka Gandhi
 lekin priyanka gandhi kuch badali-badali si najar aa rahi thi
 There has been a change in Priyanka's hair
 badal chukaa he priyanka kaa hair style, badal chukaa he priyanka ke baalo kaa andaaj
 Seeing this new hairstyle of Priyanka, people will surely miss Indira Gandhi
 saalon pehle jaisi dikhti thim daadi indira gandhi, aaj priyanka gandhi hoobahu waisi hi dikh rahi hai
 Priyanka has already increased her hair length slightly
 priyanka gandhi ke baalo kii lambaai pehle thodi choti hua karti thi lekin ab unki hair style badal chuki he
 Anyway, how can Priyanka's style change and not compare her to Indira Gandhi
 log unhen usee rup main dekhte hai, jaise ki kabhi indira gandhi ko dekha karte the
 Whenever Priyanka Gandhi is seen on public occasion, she looks like a well-worn sari as a dress
 to udhar indira gandhi kii pasandida poshaak bhi sari hi thi
 People in power and politics always saw Indira in the same style
 chote taraashe hue bal, gale main rudraksh kii maala, safed dial vaali ghadi or sari
 At least in terms of hairstyles and saris, Priyanka seems to be following in her grandmother's footsteps
 haalanki priyanka kabhi-kabhaar pashchimi paridhaanon main bhi najar aati hai to uskaa bhi sidhaa jawaab he ki aakhir indira or priyanka ke bich puri do pidiyon kaa faaslaa bhi to he
 Although the older generation sees Indira Gandhi as their role model in Priyanka Gandhi, the new generation sees a twenty-first century face full of confidence in Priyanka
 or ab hubuhu indira jaisi hair style ke baad to log yakeenan rajeev gandhi ke saath-saath indira ko bhi jarur yaad kar rahe honge
 It is not for the first time that there is a resemblance between granddaughter Priyanka and grandmother Indira
 pehle bhi priyanka kaa cheharaa, priyanka kaa andaaj or priyanka kaa pahanava indira kii yaad dilaa gaya he
 Priyanka herself has also said that her nose looks exactly like grandmother Indira's
 logon ko priyanka ke pahanaave main hi nahin balki unke bolne or unki bhaashan dene kii style main bhi indira hi yaad aati hai
 Priyanka and Priyanka people see Indira's image in Sonia too

 Through this, you always keep the path of conversation open, which can prove to be magical for your relationship

 During the hearing on Wednesday, the court said that the floor test will no longer be held on April 29 in the assembly
 teen may ko maamle kii agali sunwaayee hogi
 The Supreme Court has also asked the Center seven questions on this matter
 court ne uthaae rajyapal ke faisle par savalcourt ne kaha ki kya rajyapal ne artical 175 (2) ke tahat floor test rokane kaa sandesh bheja tha? or kya rajyapal aisa kar sakate hai? rajya vidhansabha main 9 vidhayakon ko ayogy ghoshit kiye jane ke maamle main court ne poocha ki kya vidhansabha sadasyon ko ayogy ghoshit karnaa sahi he? or apropriation bill kis stage par he or raashtrapati kaa is par kya kahana he?floor test main deree raashtrapati shashan kaa aadhaar nahincourt ne yah sawaal bhi kiya ki floor test main deree hona, kyarashtrapati shashan lagane kaa aadharho saktaa he? atorni general mukul rohtagi ne court main kaha ki agar mani bill 18 march ko paas hua to use governor ke paas kyon nahin bheja gaya
 Why was it sent on 27 March? To this, Harish Rawat and Congress lawyer Abhishek Manu Singhvi said that the delay in sending the money bill to the governor could be the basis of President's rule? How will Delhi decide whether the bill was passed in the state or not, Singhvi said that it should be accepted Even if the sting operation is correct, it cannot be the basis of President's rule
 pehle hi esaaar bommai or rameshwar prasad ke sandarbh main die gaye faislon main supreme court kah chuki he ki kisi bhi paristhiti main floor test hi ek rasta bachataa he
 Appearing for Rawat, senior advocate Kapil Sibal argued that whether the cabinet sitting in Delhi will decide whether the money bill was passed in the state or not?

 The High Court gave the decision to abolish the President's rule
 Earlier, on the Central Government's decision to impose President's rule in Uttarakhand, the Nainital High Court ordered a restriction on the government
 21 april ko sunwaayee main court ne centre sarkaar ko fatkaar lagaate hue uttarakhand se raashtrapati shashan hataane kaa aadesh diya tha
 Also on April 29, in the Assembly, Harish Rawat was ordered to conduct floor test
 sunwaayee ke dauraan court ne sakht tippanee karte hue poocha tha ki 'kya is cese main sarkaar privet party he?hai court ke faisle par supreme court ne lagaai rodgale hi din supreme court ne is faisle par roak lagaakar 27 april ko agali sunwaayee tak raashtrapati shashan ko jari rakhane kaa aadesh diya tha

 justise deepak mishra or shiv kirti singh kii bench main atorni general ne daleel rakhi ki abhi tak hoicourt ke aadesh kii copy nahin mili he
 So stay on this decision
 unhone court ko bataaya ki hai court ke faisle kii copy 26 april tak mil paaegi
 Whose bench ruled that President's rule in Uttarakhand would remain intact till 27 April
 uttarakhand main 27 march ko laga tha raashtrapati shashanuttarakhand main jari raajnneetik sankat ke bich 27 march ko raashtrapati shashan lagu kar diya gaya tha
 The central government took this decision following the report of Governor KK Paul

 Home Minister Rajnath Singh also spoke to the DG BSF on Thursday and asked for a strict reply
 kisi bhi rishte kii niv kai baton par tiki hoti he
 The beginning of the relationship between women and men is most important
 mahilaayein aamtaur par purushon main kuch baaten khojati hai
 These things make women happy and satisfied with their relationship
 aage jaaniye purushon kii aisi baaten, jo karti hai mahilaon ko aakarshith
 1
 yakeen or swabhaav:kisi bhi rishte kii shuruyaat to bahari sundarataa yaa shuruaati baton ko dekhakar ho jaati he, lekin ek rishta lambey vakt tak tik paata he, do logon ke swabhaav or ek duusare par yakeen karne se
 The most and most important thing a woman wants among men is trust and temperament
 agar kisi purush kaa swabhaav acha nahin he yaa wo yakeen karne laayak nahin he to us rishte ke zyada dinon tak chalane ke chance hi nahin hai
 Therefore, temperament and confidence attract women the most
 2
 Look and attractive: Men's good personality means a lot to women
 purushon kaa skin color bhi mahilaon ke dil or dimag par asar chhodane main safal hote hai
 3
 muskaan:achche kapade or acchhee luk ke baad agar kuch mahilaon ko prabhavit karata he, to wo he muskaan
 a sweet and honest smile affects women the most
 4
 Humer: If you have the ability to laugh
 yani aapkaa humar acha he to yakeen maniye, aap apane aas paas kii mahilaon par apni chhap chhodane main kaamyaab ho sakate hai
 5
 shaareerik dhaancha:sies myne rakhata he
 Length and weight are the things that women pay most attention to
 ek report ke mutabik, mahilaayein zyada lambey or chote purushon ko kam pasand karti hai
 So an average height and length matters the most for women

 *** Raman Singh said that after Chhattisgarh was born in 2000, we found an area where there was no sign of development
 rajya main road, power, shiksha, swasthya jaise kshetron main 2003 tak koi kaam nahin kiya gaya
 But after this, his government laid the foundation of development in the state and today due to continuous efforts for the past 15 years, the state has stood as an ideal and modern state in front of the entire country

 Millions of people are being prepared to get jobs from these centers
 raman singh ne kaha ki sadakon ke alaava pipipi model par chalate hue rajya sarkaar ne rail network ko failaane kaa kaam kiya he
 Raman Singh said that earlier he used to travel around New Delhi for the rail line but the rail network did not increase by one kilometer
 ab rajya ke is pipipi model par chalate hue rajya sarkaar ne 1200 kilometre kaa rail network taiyaar kiya he
 Raman Singh claimed that within the next 6 months he will complete the work of providing electricity to every village and towns in the state

 However, Raman Singh said that the security agencies in the state are doing a good job, can fully protect any area of the state
 raman singh ne kaha ki chhattisgarh ne kisaanon se chaaval kharidne kii ek adarsh yojana banaakar taiyaar kar lee he

 If Aadhaar can be passed, then it should be expected that this can also be the basis of passing GST
 yahi sab kuch bindu hai jahaan bhartiya raajnneeti ke ghor pratidwandi congress or bijepi samaan lagane lagate hai
 The feud between the two begins with protests, later escalating to suggestions, then a reshuffling of the amendments leads to a reconciliation between the two
 bangladesh se zamin kii adla badali ho, jiesti ho yaa aadhaar card ho
 Aadhaar is no longer fraud for BJP
 congress bijepi ne apane tajurbon se sikh liya he
 CPM leader Sitaram Yechury questioned the introduction of the Aadhaar bill as a money bill
 kaha ki is maamle main supreme court kii paanch jajon kii bench vichaar kar rahi he
 What was the hurry to bring the bill? mani bill kaa rup dekar rajyasabha ke adhikaar ko chunauti di gai he
 The Finance Minister said that even when the matter is in court, Parliament reserves the right to make laws
 agar paisa bharat ke rajkosh se sambandhit he to wo mani bill ho saktaa he
 The question definitely arose but the question was not accepted
 bahes mani bill ke rup main hi hui
 Under the Money Bill, the Rajya Sabha can suggest amendments to a bill but cannot stop it for more than 14 days
 ise paas maan liya jayega
 But today the opposition, with its objections, surrounded the government in such a way that many amendments had to be accepted and the bill was sent to the Lok Sabha to be passed again
 yechuri ke alaava congress ke jairam ramesh ne bhi aadhaar bill par kai sawaal khadey kiye
 Jairam Ramesh also came after doing a lot of research on the money bill aspect
 unhone jo kaha wo hamen yah bhi samajhane main madad karata he ki ek saansad apni jaankaree se sadan ko kitna samrudh kar saktaa he or us jaankaree ke liye wo kitni mehnat karata he
 On March 5, Finance Minister Jaitley countered the Congress in the Lok Sabha, saying that in his government, the Juvenile Justice Bill of 1986 and the African Development Bank Bill of 1983 were introduced as Money Bill
 jairam ramesh ne bataaya ki ise check karne ke liye ve sansad kii librari main gaye
 Read the 500-page report
 donon bill se jude afasaron ke paas bhi gaye
 Asked the Rajya Sabha Secretariat whether it was a money bill or not
 donon hi mani bill nahin the
 i have received this note from the Rajya Sabha Secretariat, but i want the Leader of the House to tell what information was manufactured that both were money bills
 jetali ko jawaab dena pad gaya ki unhen ye jaankaree loksabhaa kii website se mili he
 Rajya Sabha Deputy Chairman P
 je
 Kurien said that it could be a data entry issue
 ise sadan main alag se niptaya jayega
 There may be a mistake regarding the entry of the data on which we are so trusting, that too on the website of the same house where the government is assuring that the information submitted for the Aadhar card cannot be leaked
 lekin loksabhaa ke saansadon ne jairam ramesh kii tarah mehnat kyon nahin kii
 According to the Scroll News site, when the Aadhaar bill was introduced in the Lok Sabha in 2016, only 73 out of 545 mps were present in the House when it passed it
 rajyasabha main sarkaar ke paas bahumat nahin he lekin vahaan is bill ke praavdhaanon ko lekar khub gheraa ghaari hui
 Jairam raised many questions, which he also got passed by the Rajya Sabha as amendments
 jaise biomitric jaankaree, kor biomitric jaankaree or demographic jaankaree kii bill main hi baariki se vyakhya kii jaae taaki baad main unki vyakhya niyamon kii shakl main manamaane tareeke se naa kii ja sake
 The person involved in the Aadhaar scheme should get the option to exit from it and after that all the information related to it should be destroyed
 athurity iskaa certificket bhi de
 Aadhaar should be optional, not mandatory
 jo vyakti aadhaar kaa hissaa nahin bananaa chahta use sarkari suvidhaayen or sabsidi hasil karne ke liye duusare vikalp die jane chahie
 National security is a very broad and loosely worded word, instead of the word public emergency, as in the Indian Telegraph Act
 loksabhaa main aadhaar bill bina sanshodhan ke paas hua tha
 In the Rajya Sabha, four amendments of Jairam Ramesh passed in the House as the majority here is with the opposition
 sansadeey ranneeti ke jaankaar maanate hai ki aisa hona kisi bhi sarkaar ke liye sharmindagi se kam nahin he
 Although the government is not obliged to accept the amendments passed in the Rajya Sabha, but under the rules it will have to be passed back in the Lok Sabha
 vitt mantri ne kaha he ki is bill ke tahat vyaktigat gopneeyata ke bhang hone kii ashanka sahi nahin he
 Aadhaar data will not be shared under any circumstances other than national security
 ek choti si kahani he
 i do not know whether it helps to understand the dispute of Aadhaar but can share
 is kahani kaa koi aadhaar number nahin he or na hi iskaa kisi ke paas biometric he
 In 1906, a law was introduced in South Africa that all Asian men would have to register and show an identity card on which they would have thumb prints
 jiske paas aisa nahin he to use waapas jahaaz se vahaan bhej diya jayega jahaan se aayaa he
 Gandhi called a public meeting against this and refused to accept this law as a black law
 gandhi ne puure kanoon kaa virodh karte hue anguuthe ke nishaan ko lekar bhi virodh kiya yah abhi bataane kii sthiti main nahin hum
 But the Finance Minister gave the example of America that it was only in 1935 that America made Social Security number
 ham 80 saal peeche hai
 It was challenged several times in America
 inakam tex ke liye zaruri kiya, kai nitiyon or aarthik gatividhiyon, hathiyaar rakhane ke liye ise compalsri kiya gaya
 This helped him in his National Security
 ise lagaataar chalange diya gaya or har maamle main unki adaalaton ne kaha ki neshnal security ek sahi vajah he
 a fundamental difference between the US Social Security Number and India's Aadhaar Number is that biometric identification is not used for Social Security Number
 arthath aapaki ungaliyon ke nishaan, ankhon kii putali kaa scan nahin kiya jaataa he
 a large part of the controversy over Aadhaar is also about biometric identification
 agar america main 1935 main soshal security number aa gaya tha to us desh main aadhaar kyon nahin aayaa yaa soshal security number main biometric pahchaan kyon nahin jod di gai
 Whereas in that country of dreams are also poor and the government subsidizes them
 maine ek vidhayak ji se baat kii jo aadhaar card banavaane kii prakriya se jude rahe hai
 He said that while working for many women and the utensils are worn, the knuckles are worn out
 aisi mahilaon ke biometric nishaan lene main dikkat aati he
 After becoming biometric, what will happen to the fingers when fingers are worn out later
 kya wo rashan kii dukaan se lautaa di jaaegi
 The same problem also comes with male laborers
 kai baar bujurgon kii ungaliyon kii por ke nishaan milte hi nahin hai
 Due to cataract, it is difficult to match the mark of pupils
 desh ke kai rajyon main motiyobind ke oparation ke baad ankhon kii roshni chali jaati he
 What would happen in such a situation if we would inevitably depend on Aadhaar
 kai baar mashiinon kii gunvattta main antar ke kaaran bhi kaaphi fark aa jaataa he
 The BJD MP said that many times biometric does not work properly in Parliament itself
 vaise kai jagahon par biometric mashin bich bich main kaam nahin karti he
 If due to this, a poor person does not get ration on the same day, what will happen to him
 ek sawaal he gopneeyata ke bhang hone kaa
 One question is to protect the information submitted under Aadhaar
 ye bilkul aaj kal kii khabar he ki bangladesh ke videshi mudra bhandar ko hack kar liya gaya or 10 karod dollar uda liye gaye
 The governor of the central bank there had to resign
 june 2013 main britain ke gardian akhbaar snowden ke hawaale se kai khulaase chhapane laga ki kaise america kii neshnal security agency apane or duniya ke darjanon mulkon ke ek arab se adhik nagarikon kii jasusi karti he
 Keeping an eye on their internet and telephone activities
 kuch samay pehle soni pikchar ke computer system par haikaron ne hamalaa bol diya tha
 China also hacks the site
 sibar yuddh ek hakeekat he
 In such a situation, how can we claim that such huge data is safe
 march 2015 main sarkaar ne sansad ko bataaya tha ki 2012 se lekar march 2015 ke biit 700 se adhik sarkari website ko hack kiya gaya he magar unamem koi samvedansheel soochna nahin thi
 According to the government guidelines, government computers with sensitive information are different from the rest of the system
 tippaniyan Usha Ranganathan wrote on the news site Scroll
in that heard an advertisement on the radio a few days ago
 ek company daawa kar rahi he ki wo bharat kaa pehla aadhaar par aadhaarit mobile ap he jo aapke ghar main kaam karne vaale logon jaise dryver, teacher, kiraayedaar kii pahchaan kii pushti karata he
 Usha Ranganathan is warning that if a private company can do this, then think about how companies can use your Aadhaar information in their own interest
 to ham suraksha or gopneeyata ko lekar aaj bhi bahes karenge
 In prime time
 sipiem netaa seetaram yechuri ne aadhaar bill ko mani bill ke rup main pesh karne par sawaal uthaaya
 Said that a bench of five judges of the Supreme Court is considering in this matter
 bill laane kii jaldi kya thi
 The authority of Rajya Sabha has been challenged by giving form of money bill
 vitt mantri ne kaha ki tab bhi jabaki maamla adaalat main he, sansad ke paas kanoon banane ke adhikaar surakshit hai
 If the money belongs to the treasury of India then it can be a money bill
 sawaal zarur uthe magar sawaal ko sweekaar nahin kiya gaya
 The debate took place in the form of a money bill
 mani bill ke tahat rajyasabha kisi bill main sanshodhan suza sakati he magar 14 din se zyada roak nahin sakati
 It will be considered a pass
 magar aaj vipaksh ne apane etraazon se sarkaar ko aise gheraa ki kai sanshodhano ko sweekaar karnaa pad gaya or bill ko phir se paas hone ke liye loksabhaa main bheja gaya
 Apart from Yechury, Jairam Ramesh of Congress also raised many questions on the Aadhaar bill
 jairam ramesh bhi mani bill vaale pahalu par kaaphi research karke aae the
 What he said also helps us understand how much an MP can enrich the House with his knowledge and how hard he works for that information
 vitt mantri jetali ne 5 march ko loksabhaa main congress par palatwaar karte hue kaha tha ki unki sarkaar main bhi 1986 kaa juvenil justise bill or 1983 kaa african deveopment bank bill mani bill ke rup main pesh kiya gaya tha
 Jairam Ramesh told that he went to the Library of Parliament to check it
 500 pannon kii report padhi
 Both also went to the officers associated with the bill
 rajyasabha sachivalay se poocha ki kya ye mani bill he yaa nahin
 Both were not money bills
 ye ek note mujhe rajyasabha sachivalay se mila he lekin main chahta hum ki sadan ke netaa bataayen ki ye jaankaree kya menuphacture hui ki donon mani bill the
 Jaitley had to answer that he got this information from the Lok Sabha website
 rajyasabha ke up sabhapati pi
 J

 Apart from Yechury, Jairam Ramesh of Congress also raised many questions on the Aadhaar bill
 jairam ramesh bhi mani bill vaale pahalu par kaaphi research karke aae the
 What he said also helps us understand how much an MP can enrich the House with his knowledge and how hard he works for that information
 vitt mantri jetali ne 5 march ko loksabhaa main congress par palatwaar karte hue kaha tha ki unki sarkaar main bhi 1986 kaa juvenil justise bill or 1983 kaa african deveopment bank bill mani bill ke rup main pesh kiya gaya tha
 Jairam Ramesh told that he went to the Library of Parliament to check it
 500 pannon kii report padhi
 Both also went to the officers associated with the bill
 rajyasabha sachivalay se poocha ki kya ye mani bill he yaa nahin
 Both were not money bills
i have received ye ek note mujhe rajyasabha sachivalay se mila he lekin main chahta hum ki sadan ke netaa bataayen ki ye jaankaree kya menuphacture hui ki donon mani bill the

 prime time main
 On March 5, Finance Minister Jaitley countered the Congress in the Lok Sabha, saying that in his government, the Juvenile Justice Bill of 1986 and the African Development Bank Bill of 1983 were introduced as Money Bill
 jairam ramesh ne bataaya ki ise check karne ke liye ve sansad kii librari main gaye
 Read the 500-page report
 donon bill se jude afasaron ke paas bhi gaye
 Asked the Rajya Sabha Secretariat whether it was a money bill or not
 donon hi mani bill nahin the
 i have received this note from the Rajya Sabha Secretariat, but i want the Leader of the House to tell what information was manufactured that both were money bills
 jetali ko jawaab dena pad gaya ki unhen ye jaankaree loksabhaa kii website se mili he
 Rajya Sabha Deputy Chairman P
 je
 Kurien said that it could be a data entry issue
 ise sadan main alag se niptaya jayega
 There may be a mistake regarding the entry of the data on which we are so trusting, that too on the website of the same house where the government is assuring that the information submitted for the Aadhar card cannot be leaked
 lekin loksabhaa ke saansadon ne jairam ramesh kii tarah mehnat kyon nahin kii
 According to the Scroll News site, when the Aadhaar bill was introduced in the Lok Sabha in 2016, only 73 out of 545 mps were present in the House when it passed it
 rajyasabha main sarkaar ke paas bahumat nahin he lekin vahaan is bill ke praavdhaanon ko lekar khub gheraa ghaari hui
 Jairam raised many questions, which he also got passed by the Rajya Sabha as amendments
 jaise biomitric jaankaree, kor biomitric jaankaree or demographic jaankaree kii bill main hi baariki se vyakhya kii jaae taaki baad main unki vyakhya niyamon kii shakl main manamaane tareeke se naa kii ja sake
 The person involved in the Aadhaar scheme should get the option to exit from it and after that all the information related to it should be destroyed
 athurity iskaa certificket bhi de
 Aadhaar should be optional, not mandatory
 jo vyakti aadhaar kaa hissaa nahin bananaa chahta use sarkari suvidhaayen or sabsidi hasil karne ke liye duusare vikalp die jane chahie
 National security is a very broad and loosely worded word, instead of the word public emergency, as in the Indian Telegraph Act
 loksabhaa main aadhaar bill bina sanshodhan ke paas hua tha
 In the Rajya Sabha, four amendments of Jairam Ramesh passed in the House as the majority here is with the opposition
 sansadeey ranneeti ke jaankaar maanate hai ki aisa hona kisi bhi sarkaar ke liye sharmindagi se kam nahin he
 Although the government is not obliged to accept the amendments passed in the Rajya Sabha, but under the rules it will have to be passed back in the Lok Sabha
 vitt mantri ne kaha he ki is bill ke tahat vyaktigat gopneeyata ke bhang hone kii ashanka sahi nahin he
 Aadhaar data will not be shared under any circumstances other than national security
 ek choti si kahani he
 i do not know whether it helps to understand the dispute of Aadhaar but can share
 is kahani kaa koi aadhaar number nahin he or na hi iskaa kisi ke paas biometric he
 In 1906, a law was introduced in South Africa that all Asian men would have to register and show an identity card on which they would have thumb prints
 jiske paas aisa nahin he to use waapas jahaaz se vahaan bhej diya jayega jahaan se aayaa he
 Gandhi called a public meeting against this and refused to accept this law as a black law
 gandhi ne puure kanoon kaa virodh karte hue anguuthe ke nishaan ko lekar bhi virodh kiya yah abhi bataane kii sthiti main nahin hum
 But the Finance Minister gave the example of America that it was only in 1935 that America made Social Security number
 ham 80 saal peeche hai
 It was challenged several times in America
 inakam tex ke liye zaruri kiya, kai nitiyon or aarthik gatividhiyon, hathiyaar rakhane ke liye ise compalsri kiya gaya
 This helped him in his National Security
 ise lagaataar chalange diya gaya or har maamle main unki adaalaton ne kaha ki neshnal security ek sahi vajah he
 a fundamental difference between the US Social Security Number and India's Aadhaar Number is that biometric identification is not used for Social Security Number
 arthath aapaki ungaliyon ke nishaan, ankhon kii putali kaa scan nahin kiya jaataa he
 a large part of the controversy over Aadhaar is also about biometric identification
 agar america main 1935 main soshal security number aa gaya tha to us desh main aadhaar kyon nahin aayaa yaa soshal security number main biometric pahchaan kyon nahin jod di gai
 Whereas in that country of dreams are also poor and the government subsidizes them
 maine ek vidhayak ji se baat kii jo aadhaar card banavaane kii prakriya se jude rahe hai
 He said that while working for many women and the utensils are worn, the knuckles are worn out
 aisi mahilaon ke biometric nishaan lene main dikkat aati he
 After becoming biometric, what will happen to the fingers when fingers are worn out later
 kya wo rashan kii dukaan se lautaa di jaaegi
 The same problem also comes with male laborers
 kai baar bujurgon kii ungaliyon kii por ke nishaan milte hi nahin hai
 Due to cataract, it is difficult to match the mark of pupils
 desh ke kai rajyon main motiyobind ke oparation ke baad ankhon kii roshni chali jaati he
 What would happen in such a situation if we would inevitably depend on Aadhaar
 kai baar mashiinon kii gunvattta main antar ke kaaran bhi kaaphi fark aa jaataa he
 The BJD MP said that many times biometric does not work properly in Parliament itself
 vaise kai jagahon par biometric mashin bich bich main kaam nahin karti he
 If due to this, a poor person does not get ration on the same day, what will happen to him
 ek sawaal he gopneeyata ke bhang hone kaa
 One question is to protect the information submitted under Aadhaar
 ye bilkul aaj kal kii khabar he ki bangladesh ke videshi mudra bhandar ko hack kar liya gaya or 10 karod dollar uda liye gaye
 The governor of the central bank there had to resign
 june 2013 main britain ke gardian akhbaar snowden ke hawaale se kai khulaase chhapane laga ki kaise america kii neshnal security agency apane or duniya ke darjanon mulkon ke ek arab se adhik nagarikon kii jasusi karti he
 Keeping an eye on their internet and telephone activities
 kuch samay pehle soni pikchar ke computer system par haikaron ne hamalaa bol diya tha
 China also hacks the site
 sibar yuddh ek hakeekat he
 In such a situation, how can we claim that such huge data is safe
 march 2015 main sarkaar ne sansad ko bataaya tha ki 2012 se lekar march 2015 ke biit 700 se adhik sarkari website ko hack kiya gaya he magar unamem koi samvedansheel soochna nahin thi
 According to the government guidelines, government computers with sensitive information are different from the rest of the system
 tippaniyan Usha Ranganathan wrote on the news site Scroll
in that heard an advertisement on the radio a few days ago
 ek company daawa kar rahi he ki wo bharat kaa pehla aadhaar par aadhaarit mobile ap he jo aapke ghar main kaam karne vaale logon jaise dryver, teacher, kiraayedaar kii pahchaan kii pushti karata he
 Usha Ranganathan is warning that if a private company can do this, then think about how companies can use your Aadhaar information in their own interest
 to ham suraksha or gopneeyata ko lekar aaj bhi bahes karenge
 In prime time
 jis data par ham itnaa bharosa kar rahe hai uske entry ko lekar galati ho sakati he, wo bhi usee sadan kii website par jahaan khadey hokar sarkaar aashwaasan de rahi he ki aadhaar card ke liye jamaa kii gai jaankariyaan li nahin ho saktin
 But why did the mps of Lok Sabha not work as hard as Jairam Ramesh did
 scrol news site ke anusaar loksabhaa main jab aadhaar bill 2016 main pesh kiya gaya to uske paas karne ke vakt 545 main se 73 saansad hi sadan main maujuud the
 The government does not have a majority in the Rajya Sabha, but there is a lot of confusion surrounding the provisions of this bill
 jairam ne kai sawaal uthaae jinhen sanshodhano ke taur par unhone rajyasabha se paas bhi karavaaya
 For example, biometric information, core biometric information and demographic information should be closely interpreted in the bill itself so that later they cannot be interpreted arbitrarily in the form of rules

 aadhaar ko aichhik hi hona chahie, anivaary nahin kiya janaa chahie
 The person who does not want to be a part of Aadhaar should be given other options to get government facilities and subsidies
 rashtriya suraksha bada hi vyapak or dhilaa dhaala shabd he, uski jagah public immergency shabd rakhaa jaae jaisaa ki indian telegraph act main he
 The Aadhaar bill was passed without amendment in the Lok Sabha

 Experts of parliamentary strategy believe that this is nothing short of an embarrassment for any government

 america ke soshal security number or bharat ke aadhaar number main ek buniyadi fark ye he ki soshal security number ke liye biometric pahchaan nahin lee jaati he
 That is, your fingerprints, iris is not scanned
 aadhaar ko lekar vivaad kaa bada hissaa biometric pahchaan ko lekar bhi he
 If the social security number had arrived in the US in 1935, then why did Aadhaar not come in that country or why biometric identification was not added to the social security number
 jabaki sapanom ke us mulk main bhi garib hai or sarkaar unhen sabsidi detii he
 i spoke to an MLA who has been involved in the process of making Aadhaar cards

 There is difficulty in taking biometric marks of such women
 biometric banane ke baad aage chalakar jab ungaliyon ke por ghis jate hai tab uske saath kya hoga

 An old film's song lines say, '

 On Thursday, Iran killed a US surveillance drone
 servilans drone ko maar giraaye jane ke baad america ne iran par or aarthik pratibandh lagane or sainya karrwai kii dhamkee di he
 The United States is trying to put more pressure on Iran through economic restrictions
 mana ja rahaa he ki iran par america ke naye pratibandh somvaar yani 24 june se lagu ho jaaenge
 Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia's Abha airport has been attacked
 saudi arab ke abhaa main atherport par jis yemeni vidrohi gut ne hamalaa kiya he use huti ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Saudi Arabia has been fighting this rebel faction of Yemen for more than four years
 baharhaal, huti ke pravaktaa yahia al-sari ne bataaya ki ravivaar se pehle vidrohiyon ne saudi arab ke abhaa or jijaan main saudi hawaii addon ko nishaanaa banaate hue drone se hamale kiye the
 The Yemeni rebels attempted to target Saudi Arabia on June 18 via two explosive-laden drones, one of which was killed by the army

 khachaakhach bhari bas main agar koi mahila ladies seat khaali karne ko kahati he to is baat kii 70 fisadi gunjaaish hoti he ki bahes shuru hone vaali he
 Yes, there are some animals who leave the seat before they even get sight of women
 afsos, aise purushon kii sankhya behad kam he
 But there are also some male travelers who remain stubbornly seated on the women's seat
 bason main seat naa chhodani pade iske liye iske liye nimnlikhit kinhi formule ko applai karte hai-formula-1 loha lohe ko katata he, mahila-mahila kokuch purush aise hote hai jo apni biviyon kaa sahaara lete hai
 He sits down on the side of the window and passes the order to the wife to handle the case
 phir do mahilaon kii tu-tu main-main shuru ho jaae, to koun bich bachaav kare
 Formula-2
 
 
 isi bahaane ladki chhu to legikuch purush yatri seat khaali karne ke naam par barason se seene main dafn apane acting tallent kaa parichay dene lagate hai
 They will fall ill, will act in deep sleep
 bechaari ladki ko agar taras aa gaya yaa chore se bhidane kii urchaa nahin bachi ho to wo chup ho jaati hai
 But even if a woman takes off after taking a seat and shaking the boy, the boys consider it a win win situation
 ‘bhaisahab ladki ne isi bahaane tach to kiya naa
 
 
 'formula-3 You demand a seat from me, i will threaten you
 There are some men sitting on the female seats who try to save their seats by staring at women, making dirty gestures
 ye bhi nahin chalaa to dhamkee dete hai
 They take off after quarreling
 ghar kaa daftar kaa sara gussa us bechaari mahila par utaarte hai
 Some become silent due to fear
 lekin rohtak kii bahanon ne anjaane main hi sahi baaki mahilaon kaa path pradarshit kiya he
 So there is also a chance that if the boy or the overloaded man from the super-active hormone made more lumps, then the belt or shoes will be seen on the face
 ye ladkiyaan vaise to bahut purushon kii barabari karti phirti hai
 
 
 Often male travelers complain that even though the mixes fill the ranks of the men, why do they need reserved seats in buses? Well, most of these people are those who enjoy reservation for Minority, OBC, or SC ST
 lekin mahilaon kii baari ai, to sab bhul jate hai
 Women are mentally equal to men, not physically
 25 percent seats in DTC buses are reserved for women
 35 seat vaali lo floor bason main chah siten or 42 siton vaali standard floor cluster bason main aath siten mahilaon ke liye arakshit hoti hai
 The number of seats has been increased after the Nirbhaya gangrape
 mahilaon ke liye in siton ko isliye rigerv rakhaa gaya he kyonki bheed bhaad main ladakiyon ke saath badasluki hoti he
 People will now see another park in Lucknow, the city of Nawabs, famous in the world for parks and monuments
 akhilesh yadav sarkaar dwaara divangat samaajawaadee netaa janeshwar mishra kii smriti main lakhanu main vishwastareey park banane kii ghoshnaa ko amali jama pehanaane kii kayaavad shuru ho gai he
 The Lucknow Development Authority (LDA) officials have started brainstorming about what the proposed Janeshwar Mishra Smriti Park will look like on 500 acres in Vyomkhand, Gomtinagar area of the capital
 lakhanu main ab tak gomtinagar sthit 85 acre ke kshetrafal main failaa dow
 Ram Manohar Lohia Park is the largest
 prastaavit park isse kareeb chah guna bada hoga
 The special thing is that this park will not be based on stones or concrete, rather greenery and nature will be given prominence in it
 rajya sarkaar ke ek adhikari ne bataaya, 'desh ke sabase bade parks kaa kshetrafal bhi 120 acre ke aas-paas he
 It will definitely be the largest park in the country
 prastaavit park main purvavarti sarkaar dwaara nirmit parks kii tarah badi maatra main pathar ke prayog kii jagah hariyaali par jor hoga
 The government has asked the LDA officials to consult experts to develop this park
 ld ke adhikari america, austrailia, england sahit duniya ke anya deshon ke parks ke bare main adhyayan kar jaankaree jutaney main lag gaye hai
 LDA Secretary Ashtabhuja Prasad Tiwari said, 'the park in 500 acres is a wonderful thing in itself
 itani hariyaali kisi bhi shahar ke liye ek alokik anubhav hoga
 "he said," We are studying about the parks all over the world to make this proposed park of Vyamkhand a wonderful one and people coming here have a special experience
 aane vaale dinon main park ke swaroop ko amali jama pehanaanaa shuru kar diya jayega
 An official of the authority said that according to the initial discussions that have taken place so far, the proposed park will have a wide green area along with reservoir, boating, auditorium and many such places which will entertain and enlighten people
 mana ja rahaa he ki is park kii hariyaali puure lakhanu main maujuud green belt ke lagbhag baraabar hogi or isse na sirf is shahar ke nivaasiyon ko hariyaali kaa anand milegaa balki isse lagaataar badhate taapmaana par asar padegaa
 It may be known that various parks and monuments have been constructed in Lucknow by the previous Mayawati government at a cost of thousands of crores of rupees
 haalanki in smarakon or parkon main hariyaali ke bajaay chaaron taraf pathar hi pathar dekhne ko miltaa he
 Three phases of Uttar Pradesh assembly elections have been completed
 chauthe charan ke liye bundelkhand ke saat jilon samet kul 12 jilon kii 53 vidhansabha siton par 23 farvari ko matdaan hona he
 In this stronghold of the nehru-gandhi family, this time the socialist family is also contesting elections together
 gathbandhan ke baad upi ke do ladke yani mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav or congress ke rashtriya upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi milakar chunavi jansabhaayen kar rahe hai or logon se vot kii apil kar rahe hai
 On the other hand, the third boy of UP is completely missing from the election summer
 is ladke kaa naam he varun gandhi jo sultanpur se bijepi ke saansad hai or upi main bijepi ke sabase charchit yuva netaa hai
 Varun Gandhi was included in the second list of star campaigners for the UP election by the Bharatiya Janata Party
 haalanki duusari list main bhi varun kaa naam sabase neeche aayaa
 Varun was to campaign in the third and fourth phases
 varun na to tisare charan main koi jansabha karte najar aae or na hi kahin chauthe charan ke liye unki maujuudagi saamne aa rahi he
 Even in his parliamentary constituency Sultanpur, Varun is absent
 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav main varun ne pilibhit seat se 50 fisadi voton ke saath jeet darj kii jabaki 2014 caloksabhaa chunaavamein varun sultanpur loksabhaa seat se kareeb 43 fisadi voton ke saath saansad bane
 Not only this, Varun is known for doing a lot of work from poor to youth in his constituency
 phir aakhir aisa kya hua ki virodhiyon ke khilaaf sakht lahaza rakhane vaala bijepi kaa ye firebrands yuva netaa philhal khamosh he
 Varun is silent due to these reasons, the discussion in the political corridors is that Varun's stature started in the party only after Narendra Modi became the Prime Minister and Amit Shah became the National President
 2014 main bijepi ke sabase yuva rashtriya mahasachiv ke pad se varun ko hataa diya gaya
 Apart from this, on 12 June 2016, during the BJP National Executive meeting in Allahabad, Varun Gandhi's posters were spread all over the city
 postaron menvarun gandhiko upi kaa siem phase banane kii maang uthaai gai
 At that national executive meeting, the party was busy finalizing the strategy for the UP elections and after the posters were posted on the walls of Allahabad, there was a message in the party that Varun wanted to stake his claim
 darasal varun khud bhi do darjan vaahanon kaa kafila lekar shahar main road sho karte najar aae the
 It is also related to the Gandhi family that Varun's deep connection with the Gandhi family has also led to his marginalization under Modi's leadership
 darasal iske peeche ek badi vajah bhi he
 Varun Gandhi never commented on Congress President Sonia Gandhi or Rahul Gandhi under the party line
 yahaan tak ki varun ne sonia or rahul ke sansadeey kshetra raibareli or amethi main bijepi ke liye chunaav prachaar tak karne kaa dam nahin bharaa
 Varun never fulfilled the bjp's aspirations to surround the Gandhi family in public forums
 varun kii gairmaujuudagi sirf chunavi manchon par nahin he balki soshal media se bhi chunaav main unki ghatati ruchi ke pramaan mil rahe hai
 On one hand, while the rallies of Akhilesh and Rahul from PM Modi are being broadcast live on social media, no pictures related to the UP elections are visible on Varun's Twitter and Facebook wall
 chunaav tarikhon ke elaan ke baad varun kii fasebuk wal par rajasthan or kerala main chaatro ke bich kaaryakramon kii tasviren or video hi aplod kii gai hai
 Recently, a video of Varun Gandhi in objectionable position also went viral
 charchaa he ki varun kii khamoshi or defensive mod ke peeche ye bhi ek badi vajah he
 However, the vote in Varun Gandhi's stronghold is on 23 February
 aise main varun kaa chunaav prachaar main bad-chadhakar hissaa na lenaa party main unke rutabe or bhoomika donon par sawaal khadey karata he
