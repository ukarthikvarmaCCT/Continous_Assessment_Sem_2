 fasebuk par ‘kisaan netaa-raja hair’ ne rahul gandhi kaa video daal kar kaha “durbhagyapurna, ye bhai sahab hamaare desh ke piem ke daavedaar hai dawaai banane vaali factory main fasal bikwa denge bol rahaa he, had ho gai”
 This post has been shared 72 times and seen by more than a thousand people
 vahiin twitor par “sonia he to kamishan he” naam ke twitor handle ne daawa karte hue kaha “setting ap pharma factories so det farmars can cell vegitables der”(pharma companiyon ko sthapit kiya jayega taaki kisaan vahaan sabzi bech saken)

 video main rahul gandhi kah rahe hai, “hamaari puri koshish hogi ki ham aapke local kisaanon kii samasya hal karen or dawaai banane vaali factory yahaan paas main lagaaein ki aap apana maal vahaan dawaai vaali factory main bech paao

 darasal un dinon rajasthan vidhaan sabha chunaav ke maddenzar congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi chitaudgarh main raily karne pahunche the
 What Rahul Gandhi said at that rally can be heard here
 is bhaashan main rahul gandhi ne naa sabji naa kisi fasal kaa zikr kiya he
 If the entire speech is heard then it is clear that Rahul Gandhi talks about bringing food processing units and medicine factories to the fields
 bhaashan main rahul gandhi kehete hai ki wo chitaudgarh ke bare main baat karnaa chaahate hai
 For the farmers, he talks about laying a trap for the food processing unit and then setting up a medicine factory nearby
 unke is bayaan ke baad unhen sunne ai bheed unke naam kaa naaraa lagaati he or jai jayakaar karti he
 The people of Chittorgarh did not find anything strange about Rahul Gandhi because in Chittorgarh, opium, Ajwain, Isabgol are grown which are used in making medicines
 is baat kii pushti is khabar menyaha seki ja sakati he
 On the other hand, this news of December 30 last year can be read here, which states that a delegation of the Opium Farmers Development Committee of India had reached Delhi to meet Arun Jaitley

 They hit me by opening the door

 ' ek shaadishuda yuvak or shaadishuda yuvati ke bich kaaphi lambey samay se avaidh sambandh the
 One day the young man takes his alleged girlfriend to Agra on the pretext of visiting the Taj Mahal and brutally murders him on the way
 yuvak ne apni premika kii isliye hatya kar di kyonki ab vah usase bevafaayee karne lagi thi
 The deceased's name was Mamta and she was a resident of Chhatarpur area of delhi, while accused Dharmendra Sirohi runs a security agency in Chhatarpur
 police ke mutabik, dharmendra or mamata 13 saal se ek-duusare ko jaanate the
 Both got married in different places but even after that they did not leave the meeting
 premika karne lagi thi bevafyeedharmendra kii maane to vah mamata se bahutpyaar karata thalekin kuch samay se vah usase bevafaayee kar rahi thi
 He tried to convince Mamata a lot but she did not listen
 nafrat kii aag main jal rahe dharmendra ne apni jindagi se mamata ko baahar nikaal phenkane kaa faisla kar liya
 Died by the excuse of rotating, Dharmendra told Mamata to rotate the Taj Mahal and both left by car towards the Taj Mahal
 sikanderabad pahunchane ke baad donon ne sharaab pi or phir agbabula dharmendra ne chaakuon se godakar mamata kii hatya kar di or uski laash ko paas hi sthit ek naale main phenkakar vahaan se faraar ho gaya
 Police filed a case of kidnapping for several days when Mamta did not return home, her family lodged a complaint about Mamata's abduction in the police
 maamle kii jaanch karte hue dilli police kii special staff team ko isaki bhanak lag gai or chaanbin ke dauraan police ne dharmendra ko dhar dabocha
 During interrogation, Dharmendra confessed his crime
 parijanon ko thi avaidh sambandhon kii jaankarigauratlab he ki donon pariwaron ko dharmendra or mamata ke bich avaidh sambandhon kii jaankaree thi
 They both have children
 parijanon ke virodh ke baavjood donon ne ek-duusare se milanaa nahin choda tha
 Congress has suffered a setback in West Bengal
 congress ke do vidhayakon ne buudhvaar ko trinmul congress kaa daaman thaamne ke liye party chhod di
 The names of these mlas are Shankar Singh and Arindam Bhattacharjee
 is ghatnakram se pashchim bengal main trinmul ke vidhayakon kii sankhya 221 tak pahunch gai he
 At the same time, the number of Congress mlas has come down to 36
 shankar singh pashchim bengal main congress ke khantee netaaon main maane jate rahe hai
 He won the Ranaghat West assembly seat three times
 vahiin bhattacharji nadiya jile kii santipur seat se vidhayak hai
 Bhattacharjee has been the president of the West Bengal Pradesh Youth Congress
 trinmul congressaansad abhishek banerjee ne donon vidhayakon kaa party main swaagat kiya
 According to Banerjee, more big names may join Trinamool in the coming days
 is bich, pashchim bengal pradesh congress cameti ke adhyaksh adheer ranjan choudhary ne kaha he ki jo bhi trinmul main ja rahaa he wo nijee laabh ke liye aisa kar rahaa he
 Chaudhary said, if they have the courage then first resign as Congress MLA and then join the other party
 ye nahin bhoolanaa chahie ki ye saamaanya congress kaaryakarta hai, unhenvidhayakabanane ke liye apni jaan tak jokhim main daali
 It is not easy to interview three ministers in a single day - especially when they have to ask inconvenient questions
 somvaar ko modi sarkaar ke teen mantriyon kaa maine intervyuu kiya
 But all three got annoyed with my interview
 mantri pad kii shapath lene ke agle hi din unhen kuch mushkil sawaalon se guzarana padaa
 If you ask good and good questions to them, then they have no problem but as soon as the edge of the question becomes sharp, their anger also increases
 sabase pehle maine modi sarkaar ke naye swasthya mantri jepi nadda se baat kii
 i asked him a direct question that if you will continue the anti-tobacco policies of former Health Minister Dr
 Harsh Vardhan, then at first i said that now give me time to know the Ministry
 maine nitiyon ke str par unako tarah-tarah se kureda, lekin mujhe mere sawaal kaa sidhaa jawaab nahin mila
 They kept saying that the government runs in continuity
 ames ke sivio sanjeev charthuvedi kaa sawaal poochta, usase pehle mantri ji mujhe peeche chhodte hue aage nikal gaye
 Now the matter was with another minister Giriraj Singh
 pehle to hamase baat karne ko taiyaar nahin hue phir sawaal jaise hi suna, bhadak gaye or ve aage-aage, main unke peeche-peeche
 The question was just that you have not yet got a clean chit in the matter of crores of rupees recovered from your house? And are you upholding your old statement in which you said that if someone opposes Narendra Modi, then send him to Pakistan
 jaise hi camera band hua to mantri ji ne pakadakar kareeb se kaan main bole, kya dikkat he, kyon aaplog mere peeche pade hai? udhar mantri ji ke kuch logon ne hamaare cameraman vijay patwaal ko bhi pakad liya
 Of course there was nothing wrong with us and we were released immediately, but fear is bound to happen
 iske baad pahunchaa nae rajyamantri ramshankar katheria ke paas
 There are not one but more than two dozen cases going on against Zainab, ranging from attempted murder, to forgery and to rioting
 magar mantri ji ne saaf kaha ki ye saare maamle janata kii vajah se lage hai
 All these have been imposed by the state government due to political conspiracy and some have been removed and others will also be removed
 camera of hote hi kaha, aaj to shubh shubh baaten kiijie kahaan gade murde ukhaadne lage
 Obviously, if you are behind the leaders and ministers, you are very good and big, but where you surrounded them with questions, the work will start to surround you - in this you will be able to talk about the love after the interview and get closer , Very mild accents include threatening to threaten, to complain openly, and even then if you refuse to be sensible you may be at risk
 lekin yah khatara na uthaaen to patrkaar kaise kahaayen? Taking the moral responsibility of the jdu's humiliating defeat in the Lok Sabha elections, the political feud between the ruling party JDU and the opposition party BJP continued throughout the year after Nitish Kumar resigned as Bihar Chief Minister
 gat 16 may ko loksabhaa chunaav ke rigelt aae
 In this, JDU was defeated badly by the Narendra Modi-led BJP
 pradesh kii 40 sansadeey siton main se jediu ke maatr do hi seat par vijay paane par nitish ne apni party kii haar kii naitik jimmedaari lete hue gat 17 may ko bihar ke mukhyamantri pad se istipha de diya tha
 During the two-day high voltage drama, the JDU Legislature Party at first refused to accept Nitish's resignation but later accepted the decision of his tall leader and urged him to choose his successor and on May 19 The election of Nitish's Dalit leader Jitan Ram Manjhi as his successor surprised everyone
 gat 19 may ko mukhyamantri kaa pad sanbhaalane ke baad maanjhi ne argedy or congress ke sahyog se gat 23 may ko bihar vidhansabha main aasaani se vishwasamat hasil kar liya tha
 In his political journey of more than thirty years, 70-year-old Manjhi was a former minister during the tenure of Congress and RJD and was ranked 11th among ministers in Nitish's cabinet before becoming chief minister
 maanjhi ko mukhyamantri banaae jane se unhen ‘kathputli’ kii sangya dete hue bijepi ne nitish par ‘remote ke jariye’ pradesh kaa shashan chalaane kaa aarope lagaaya or kaha ki nitish ne naitikta ke naam par mukhyamantri pad se istipha diya lekin apana uttaradhikari chunane main yogyata ke bajaae vot bank par najar rakhkar unhone kis naitikta kaa nirvaah kiya he
 RJD, Congress and CPI in the bypolls of two Rajya Sabha seats held in Bihar on June 19 last year despite the JDU government's rebellion over the resurgence of some JDU mlas upset over not getting a seat in Jitan Ram Manjhi cabinet
 With the support of both the ruling party candidates Pawan Verma and Ghulam Rasool Baliyavi were victorious
 pawan or baliyavi ne bihar main sattashin jadyu ke kuch baagi vidhayakon or bijepi samarthit do nirdaleey ummidavaaron anil sharma or sabir ali ko is upachunaav main parajeet kiya tha
 nitish-lalu's Grand Alliance: With the joining of RJD supremo Lalu Prasad and former Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, who have been opposing each other for nearly 20 years, in the by-election of ten seats of Bihar Assembly on August 21, this alliance in these ten seats The BJP won six seats while BJP won four seats
 lalu kii party argedy ke ‘jangal raaj’ kaa virodh kar varsh 2005 main mukhyamantri bane nitish ke lalu se haath mila lene par bijepi ne un par apni vichaardhaara se palatney kaa aarope lagaate hue unase poocha ki nitish ko yah spasht karnaa chahie ki unhen kis majaburi ne bihar main 15 saalon tak shashan karne vaale or ‘jangal raaj’ ke taur charchit rahe argedy or congress ke saath gathbandhan karne ke liye vivash kiya
 The BJP scoffed at Nitish's party adopting a 'zero tolerance' policy towards corruption and crime, and said how they would be able to uphold these policies by working together with the RJD to protect corruption and crime
 nitish kumaar ke gat 13 november se ‘sampark yatra’ par nikalne ko bijepi ne ise janata ko lubhaane kii unki koshish qaraar diya or is yatra ke keval pradhanmantri narendra modi kii ninda yatra banakar rah jane kaa aarope lagaaya
 Nitish started trying to unite the various parties of the Janata Parivar after his Sampark Yatra in order to materialize the success achieved by the jdu-rjd-congress alliance in the Bihar assembly by-election on August 21 In a meeting held on December 4 at the residence of Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh, JDU, RJD, SP, Indian National Lok Dal, Samajwadi Janata Part And the success of consensus about the merger of JDS
 jithan ram maanjhi ke vivaadit bol:is varsh nitish jahaan narendra modi nit bijepi ke khilaaf apane ghor virdohi lalu sahit janata parivaar ke anya dalon ko ekajute karne main lage rahe vahiin unke uttaradhikari jithan ram maanjhi ke vivaadit bayanon ke kaaran nitish unke saath kai avasaron par manch saajha karne se bachate dikhe vahiin unki party jediu ko lagaataar fajihat jhelni padi
 Last August, seven Union ministers from Bihar were forced to cut the hands of doctors of Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi, calling the servants foreign, and not bringing enough help from the Center, with accepting a bribe of five thousand rupees to pay their electricity bill
 Faced with conflicting statements such as not allowing entry, JDU had to give its chief minister the advice to refrain from making such statements
 baad main maanjhi ne nitish se apane ‘matbhed’ kii charchaa ko viraam dete hue unhen jediu kaa ‘supreme’ netaa bataaya tathaa unhen varsh 2015 ke bihar vidhansabha chunaav ke baad pradesh main mukhyamantri ke pad par asin dekhne kii ichha jataayi tathaa unki sampark yatra ke dauraan gat 25 november ko jahanabad main unke saath manch saajha kiya

 After the launch of 4G service in the technology world, users have got a lot of rest
 lekin kya aap jaanate he 2ji, 3ji technology ke bare main
 When did it start? or inke aane ke baad kya kya badlaav hue the
 2G Second Generation (2G) Technology was established in 1991
 2ji technology takanic digital signal par aadhaarit he
 In short, we can call it GSM
 2 is technology ke aane ke baad maano jaise mobile technology main kranti aa gai
 Along with phonecall, users could enjoy the Internet
 ye naukariyaan chahie to 31 disambar se pehle kar den aavedanbata den, 2ji kii data transfar speed 236 kbps thi
 Most of the download and upload speeds were up to 64 kbps
 vahiin isamen pikchar massej, tex massej or multimedia massej bade aaraam se bheje ja sakate the
 But 2G was not successful in terms of video calls, video conferencing and mobile television
 3G network, jo bana front camera kii vajahavideo condorecing or mobile televijan ke maamle main 2ji safal nahin hua
 After which 3G technology created a stir in the network world in the year 2009
 isaki data transfar speed 21 mbps he, jo 2ji ke mukaable bahut zyada he
 Upload speed 5 there
 7 mbps haveheen aplod speed 5
 At 7 Mbps, it opened the way for mobile users to video calls, video conferencing and mobile television
 vahiin aaj bhi vigyapanon main 3ji ke isi feechar ko dikhaaya jaataa tha
 After the arrival of 3G, special online TV applications for mobile and laptops started coming in, as well as front camera for video calls in the phone
 jisane mobile kii duniya main tahalaka machaa diya
 Video calls became easy for users
 aaj jis front camere se aap or ham selfi lete hai, vah 3ji technology kii dein he
 Learn - How different is the study in America, choose the plan and get admission
 4G users of India had not even fully enjoyed the 3G network that in the year 2015, 4G came to the public
 vaise yah takanic 3ji ke mukaable lagbhag 5-10 guna tej he yani isamen internet kii speed 100 Mbps se 1gbps ke lagbhag he
 As technology progressed, so did the changes in smartphones
 4ji aane ke baad smartphone par bina bafring ke tivi dekhnaa, video kol karnaa, movie, software, games downlod karnaa chutkiyaaka kaam ho gaya he
 The way you copy a file from your computer will look exactly the same
 4ji aane ke pehle ek wo samay tha jab kisi movie ko raat ko downlod par laga kar sote the or subah tak sochate the ki downlod hui hogi yaa nahin or downlod hone par bahut khush hote the
 See - these are the weakest passwords, i LOVE u is also in the list about the first generation of mobile networks
 
 
 bataa den, 2ji shuruyaat se pehle 1ji mobile network aayaa tha, jise mobile network kii sabase pehali peedi kaha jaataa he
 It started in the year 1981
 1ji network ke madhyam se keval wais colling or miseging kaa hi istemaal hota tha or yah sarvice kuch chuninda kshetron main hi uplabdh thi

 shanti bhang karne ke liye banaai gai kisi bhi afvaah par dhyaan na den
 Before the removal of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah were engaged in creating a team within the Governor's administration in the state, whose responsibility is to implement this big decision and be born thereafter
 Was formed to deal with the situation
 is team main jahaan desh ke kuch varisht iees afasar shaamil hai to vahiin kuch tajurbekaar police afasar bhi maujuud hai
 In Jammu and Kashmir, the team had been working under the chairmanship of Chief Secretary Subramanian Swamy for the past several months and was working to strengthen the Governor's administration
 isiilie vijay kumaar ko jammu-kashmir ke rajyapal satyapal malik ke adwiser ke taur par niyukt kiya gaya tha
 The team consists of Jammu and Kashmir Governor Satyapal Malik, besides Jammu and Kashmir Chief Secretary Subramanian, Principal Secretary Rohit and Jammu and Kashmir Police Director Dilbag Singh
 bataa den ki jammu-kashmir ko bharat kaa abhinn ang banane ke liye pradhanmantri narendra modi ke netritv main sansad ne anuchhed 370 ko radd karne kaa kaam kiya
 After this, in view of the situation in Kashmir, schools and colleges were closed with a ban on internet service and Section 144 was implemented in the state
 gujarat main rajyasabha chunaav ko lekar congress kii yachika par chunaav ayog ne halafanama daakhil kiya he
 The Election Commission upheld its decision to hold separate elections on two seats
 halafname main kaha gaya he ki amit shah or smriti irani dwaara khaali kii gai siton par alag-alag chunaav karana kanoon ke mutabik he
 The Election Commission has said that it has been conducting these elections according to the decisions of Delhi High Court and Bombay High Court for 57 years
 chunaav ayog pehle se hi cajuel rictiyon ke liye alag-alag chunaav karaata aayaa he
 When the term of Rajya Sabha membership of a member ends, it is a regular vacancy for which simultaneous elections are held
 chunaav ayog ne dilli hoicourt ke 2009 ke satyapal malik maamle ke faisle kaa hawala diya he jisamen hai court ne kaha tha ki cajual vaikency ko alag-alag chunaav se bharaa jayega
 Earlier, the Supreme Court issued a notice to the Election Commission
 gujarat congress ke netaa vipaksh pareshabhai dhanani ne supreme court main yachika daakhil kar do siton ke liye jari chunaav ayog kii adhisuchana ko chunauti di he
 There has been a demand for simultaneous elections on the seats vacated by Amit Shah and Smriti Irani
 yachika main kaha gaya he ki ek hi din donon siton par alag-alag chunaav karana asanvaidhanik or samvidhan kii bhaavana ke khilaaf he
 Elections will be held on five July in the Rajya Sabha vacant seats from Gujarat
 daramil chunaav ayog kii adhisuchana ke mutabik amit shah ko loksabhaa chunaav jeetne kaa pramaan-patr 23 may ko hi mil gaya tha, jabaki smriti irani ko 24 may ko mila
 This made a difference of one day in both elections
 isi aadhaar par ayog ne rajya kii donon siton ko alag-alag mana he, lekin chunaav ek hi din honge
 Due to this, BJP will win both the seats, because first preference votes will be decided afresh
 ek saath chunaav hote to congress ko ek seat mil jaati
 The candidate needs 61 votes to win the Rajya Sabha election in Gujarat by number strength
 ek hi bailat par chunaav se ummidavaar ek hi vot daal paaegaa
 In this situation, the Congress could easily take a seat as it has 71 mlas
 lekin chunaav ayog ke notification ke mutabik, vidhayak alag-alag vot karenge
 In such a situation, they will get a chance to vote twice
 is tarah bijepi ke vidhayak jinaki sankhya 100 se zyada he ve do baar vot karke donon ummidavaaron ko jitwa sakate hai
 Earlier on April 9, another petition was filed in the ramjanmabhoomi-babri Masjid dispute
 nirmohi akhaada ne supreme court main nai yachika daakhil kii thi or is yachika main centre sarkaar kii ayodhya main adhigrahit kii gai atirikt jameen ko waapas dene kii arji kaa virodh kiya gaya tha
 The arena had said that the Supreme Court should first decide the land dispute
 centre ke jameen adhigrahan karne se akhaada dwaara sanchalit kai mandir nasht ho gaye
 In such a situation, this land cannot be given to the center to be returned to anyone
 akhaada ne ye bhi kaha tha ki ramajnmabhumi nyaas ko ayodhya main bahumat kii jameen nahin di ja sakati
 The Akharas had filed this petition on the January petition of the Central Government demanding the Supreme Court to return the acquired land apart from the disputed land
 philhal supreme court ne centre kii arji par sunwaayee nahin kii he

 Earlier, the record of taking the slowest hundred wickets was in the name of Venkatesh Prasad (85)
 or ab bhubaneshwar ne apane 96wein vanade main yah uplabdhi hasil kii
 Let's take a look at how many matches a Indian took for his 100 wickets rajdhani dilli ke ranhaula ilaake main berahami se katl kiye gaye quality inspector arun sharma kii hatya ke maamle main police ne bada khulaasa kiya he
 Arun's assassination plot is none other than his wife
 jisane apane teen premiyon ke saath milakar hatya kii is sansanikhej vaardaat ko anjaam diya tha
 Married Twenty Years Ago Arun Sharma, 45, was married to Santosh twenty years ago
 arun is vakt gudgaanv kii ek international company main quality inspector ke taur par kaam kar rahaa tha
 They both also have a son
 shaadi ke itane saal biit jane ke baad bhi arun or uski patni ke bich aksar jhagada hota tha
 One day Arun slapped his consolation wife in front of many people
 tabhi se santvanaa ne pati ko raste se hataane kii thaan lee thi
 Must Read: a dreadful conspiracy of murder by wife for wealth and lover; Unlawful relationship with three people; Revealing the murder of Sahala, police said that the consolation is the daughter of a professor
 arun ke saath shaadi ho jane ke baad bhi baahar uskaa prem prasang chal rahaa tha
 The consolation had not one but three lovers
 jisamen se khaas tha sandip seharaavat
 After her husband went to work, the consolation went to give food to her lover Sandeep without food
 vah uske kareeb jane ke bahaane khojati thi
 Despite the husband's persuasion and repeated refusal, he continued to meet the trio outside
 inhen teen logon ke saath milakar usne apane pati ke katl kii sajeesh rachi
 This was how the husband's consolation had fully planned to remove her husband from the road
 aakhirkaar beeti 9 navambar kii raat ko santvanaa kaa premi sandip apane do saathiyon jithendra urf jitu or subhash ko saath lekar is yojana ko amali jama pehanaane ke liye aayaa
 According to the plan, Jeetu and Subhash reached near Khedi Baba drain bridge with a mini truck
 iske baad sandip seharaavat akelaa apni premika santvanaa ke ghar gaya
 There consolation and Sandeep persuade Arun to walk out of the pretext
 jaise hi ve khedi baba pul ke paas pahunche vahaan un sabhi ne achaanak arun par hamalaa kar diya
 They all beat Arun fiercely
 phir uskaa galaa dabaa diya
 Arun was half dead
 wo sadak par gir padaa tha
 Just then, consolation, Jeetu and Subhash grab Arun's hands and feet lying on the road
 or sandip ne arun par kai baar mini trek chadhaaya
 Then they put him in the truck and took him to the edge of the drain
 jahaan arun kii saanse chalati dekhakar sandip ne arun kaa galaa dabaakar use maut ke ghat utaar diya
 He escaped from there, trampling Arun's body to make Arun's death an accident
 zarur padhein:police ne aise suljhaayaa tha hoicourt ke ek vakil kii hatya kaa maamalapati tha nampunsak?jaanch team main shaamil ek police adhikari ne bataaya ki santvanaa darasal arun kii saali thi
 But after her first wife's death, she started living with Arun
 ab police is baat kii bhi jaanch kar rahi he ki unka betaa santvanaa kaa he yaa nahin
 In fact, police officers in the investigation team have indicated the deceased's impotence
 police har pahalu se maamle kii chaanbin kar rahi he
 On the next day of such a murderous murder, the consolation informed a tenant living in his house not to come to Arun's house under a conspiracy and sent him to find Arun
 jab vah nahin mila to police main shikaayat darj karai gai
 After Arun's corpse, the consolation pretended to cry a lot
 police ne tafteesh shuru kii
 At the same time, the consolation was also questioned
 police kii sakhti ke saamne santvanaa apana jhooth nahin chipa saki
 And she kept getting entangled in the questions of the police
 iske baad maamle kaa khulaasa ho gaya
 Then the police have also arrested Sandeep, Jitendra and Subhash involved in the conspiracy to murder

 aath janvari, 2013 ko jab jharkhand mukti morcha (jeemem) pramukh shibu sorain ne arjuna munda ke netritv vaali 28 maheene puraani gathbandhan sarkaar se samarthan waapas liya to ve bas apane bete up-mukhyamantri hemanth sorain ke suzav par amal kar rahe the
 The 18-member JMM severed ties with Munda on the Congress' assurance of making Hemant the ninth chief minister of Jharkhand
 lekin hemanth ko congress se zyada shibu kii jarurat he, kyonki jeemem ke mukhiya kii maujuudagi kii abha hi unke saare jod-tod par pardaa daalati he
 On 8 January, when Hemant announced his withdrawal of support from the Munda government, no one paid attention, then he made the same announcement again to his father
 lekin vaikalpik sarkaar banane main der hui to rajyapal saiyad ahamed raashtrapati shashan kii sifarish kar sakate hai
 The command that Shibu informally handed over to Hemant is a symbol of his son-in-law
 jeemem ke ek netaa kehete hai, ‘‘ho saktaa he shibu daanvpech main maahir hon, lekin unki sabase badi kamajori unka betaa he
 "he has always been fond of his sons, but his weakness on Hemant has increased a lot since he lost his elder son Durga, whom he was grooming as his successor, in May 2009
" hemanth kisi bhi keemat par mukhyamantri kii kursi paanaa chaahate hai
 He hopes that many JMM leaders from the state's top office chair will make his dream of becoming the boss come true
 haalanki in netaaon ko unki saraparasti manjuur nahin he
 The Congress comes to such youths who are in a hurry to get everything because in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections it needs a coalition partner to strengthen its position in the state
 2009 ke vidhansabha chunaav main iske saath rahe babulal marandi ke netritv vaali jharkhand vikaas morcha ne pehle hi is peshkash ko thukraa diya he
 Therefore, in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the Congress can play JMM to put some more seats in the state
 rajya kii 14 loksabhaa siton main se congress ke paas bas ranchi he jise subodhakant sahay ne sambhaal rakhaa he
 But Congressmen are not confident of Subodh Kant's ability to retain the seat as his younger brother Sunil has forfeited his bail in the June 2012 by-election for Hatia Assembly in his Lok Sabha constituency
 is bikhri hui sthiti main sarkaar kaa gathan aasaan nahin
 The JMM needs 42 votes for a majority in the 82-member house, but it will still have a shortfall of six votes after the Congress and RJD add their votes
 haa, chah nirdaleey vidhayakon kaa vot ise mil saktaa he lekin congress inos ekka or harinarayan raay jaise vidhayakon se haath milaane ke liye taiyaar nahin jo aay se adhik sampati maamalon main fanse hai
 JMM will also need the vote of Geeta Koda, whose husband, former Chief Minister Madhu Koda is in jail
 isliye sari nigahen waapas ek hi shaks par laut rahi hai-shibu sorain
 This skilled player of Jharkhand politics will have to do everything to please the Congress
 nirdaleey vidhayakon par lagaam kasne se lekar bete ko jeemem ke diggajon ko naaraaz na karne kii naseehat tak, lekin kahana aasaan hoga karnaa thodaa mushkil

 ) pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne artiai ke durupyog par chintaa jataate hue kaha he ki iskaa galat istemaal band kiya janaa chahie
 Expressing concern over the meaningless and disturbing use of the RTI law, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said that if the right to know is violating someone's privacy, then the scope must be fixed
 needed
 adhikaron ke bich santulan jarurimanmohan singh ne kaha, ‘soochna ke adhikaar or niztaa ke adhikaar ke bich uchit santulan banaae rakhane kii aavashyaktaa he, jo jeene evam swatantraaa ke adhikaar se nikalataa he
 People's right to know must definitely be curbed, if it violates someone's privacy, but where to draw the line is a complex question
 ’artiai kaa nirarthak istemaal galatakendriya soochna ayuktaon ke saatven sammelan ko sambodhit karte hue pradhanmantri ne kaha, ‘kanoon kaa nirarthak evam pareshaan karne vaala istemaal chintaa kii baat he, jinke khulaase se kisi lok hit kii purti nahin hoti
 'manmohan Singh said that such questions also lead to loss of human resources, which can be put to better use
 pradhanmantri ne kaha, ‘kabhi-kabhaar jo suchanaaen maangi jaati hai, vah samay lene vaali hoti hai or unamem kai maamle shaamil hote hai jiskaa uddeshy aniyamitata yaa galati dhundhna hota he, jisaki aalochana kii jaani chahie
 On public-private partnership required to realize responsibilities, the Prime Minister said that bringing such bodies completely under the RTI Act would avoid private entrepreneurs from partnering with the public sector, while excluding them altogether would relieve government officials of responsibility
 samaaj sudhaarak or raajnneetijna bhimrao ambedkar kii aaj jayanti he
 He is known as Baba Saheb
 ve swatantra bharat ke pratham kanoon mantri or bhartiya samvidhan ke pramukh vaastukar the
 He inspired the Dalit Buddhist movement and campaigned against social discrimination against Dalits
 shramikon or mahilaon ke adhikaron kaa samarthan kiya
 Let's know many things related to his life
 
 
 desh ke samvidhan ko aakaar dene vaale ambedkar kaa janm 14 april saal 1891 main hua tha
 Baba Saheb is considered the cornerstone of the Indian Constitution
 unhone hindu dharm main vyaapt chhooaachhut, daliton, mahilaon or mazdooron se bhedbhaav jaisi kuriti ke khilaaf aawaaj buland kii or is ladaai ko dhar di
 He belonged to the Mahar caste, considered untouchable in Hinduism
 unki aarthik sthiti acchhee nahin hone kii vajah se unhen kai mushkilon kaa saamana bhi karnaa padaa tha
 so
 
 
 isliye kaha jaataa he dow
 Bhimrao Ambedkar faced the messianic difficulties of the Dalits as well as the evils of Hinduism and he always tried to overcome these evil practices
 uske baad oktober, 1956 main unhone buddha dharm apana liya jiske kaaran unke saath lakhon daliton ne bhi buddha dharm ko apana liya
 He believed that the goal of the human species is to continuously improve their thinking
 dow
 Ambedkar's first marriage was at the age of nine to Ramabai
 ramabai kii mrityu ke baad unhone brahman parivaar se taalluk rakhane vaali savita se vivaah kar liya
 Savita also embraced Buddhism with them
 ambedkar kii duusari patni savita kaa nidhan varsh 2003 main hua
 BR Ambedkar was made the chairman of the drafting committee of the constitution on August 29, 1947 for constitution formulation after independence
 phir unki adhyakshata main do varsh, 11 maah, 18 din ke baad samvidhan banakar taiyaar hua
 He is said to have knowledge of nine languages
 inhen desh-videsh ke kai vishvavidhyalayon se piechdi kii kai maanad oopaadhiyaan mili thim
 He had a total of 32 degrees
 saal 1990 main, unhen bharat ratna, bharat ke sarvocch naagarik sammaan se maranoparant sammanit kiya gaya tha
 That is why Baba Ambedkar had adopted Buddhism with millions of Dalits! 'I am born a Hindu, but i will not die a Hindu' With the same strength, his opponents were also pushing to stop him
 lambey sangharsh ke baad jab ambedkar ko bharosa ho gaya ki ve hindu dharm se jatipratha or chuaa-chhot kii kureetiyaan dur nahin kar paa rahe to unhone wo aitihaasik vaktavy diya, jisamen unhone kaha ki main hindu paidaa to hua hum, lekin hindu maruunga nahin
 Opposition to Hindu code bill After independence, Dr
 Ambedkar became law minister in Pandit Nehru's cabinet and on Nehru's initiative he prepared the Hindu code bill, but he also had to face strong opposition to this bill
 khud nehru bhi tab apni party ke andar or baahar is mudde par badhate dabaav ke saamne jhukate najar aae
 Differences on the issue increased so much that Ambedkar resigned from the post of Law Minister
 haalanki baad main hindu code bill paas hua or usase hindu mahilaon kii sthiti main krantikari badlaav bhi aayaa, lekin ambedkar ke bill se ye kai maamalon main lacheela tha

 yah film jisas christ ke jivan par bani thi
 The name of the film was 'the Life of Christ'
 yahi vah samay tha jab dada sahab phalke ke man main filmein banane ke khyaal ne dastak di

 The by-election in Gorakhpur Lok Sabha seat left by Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath remains a nose question for the BJP
 upachunaav kaa nateeja 2019 ke liye maahaul banane kaa kaam karegaa
 In view of this, Yogi is starting a two-day election tour from today to win BJP candidate Upendra Shukla from his traditional Gorakhpur Lok Sabha seat
 siem yogi gorakhpur loksabhaa upachunaav kaa prachaar aaj shuru karenge, pehali jansabha piparich or duusari sadar vidhansabha main karenge
 On Tuesday, CM Yogi will address the public at Gorakhpur Rural, Sahajanwa, Campierganj
 bataa den kigorakhpur loksabhaa seat yogi adityanathke siem banane ke baad khaali hui he, jis par upachunaav ho rahaa he
 For the first time in the past 28 years, BJP has given tickets to someone outside the monastery from Gorakhpur
 ye siten yogi adityanath ke liye jeetna behad ahm he, kyonki vipaksh ne bhi unki gheraabandi karne kii puri koshish kii he
 In such a situation, the Chief Minister's own reputation is at stake
 yogi kaa gorakhpur kaarykramasiem yogi adityanath lakhanu se sidhe dopaher 2: 40 baje koaparative inter kalege piparich main helicopter se pahuchenge
 After that 3
 45 tak padaav maidan piparich main hi jansabha ko sambodhit kar chunavi prachaar kaa shankhanaad karenge
 After this around 4 in the evening at CM Gorakhpur Club
 20 minute se 5 bajkar 20 minute tak gorakhpur sadar vidhansabha main janata ko sambodhit karenge
 Yogis will reach Gorakhnath Temple from Gorakhpur Club and take a night's rest
 yogi mangalvaar ko subah11
 At 5 pm, Virbahadur Singh will reach the degree college, there he will address the public at 12 noon
 iske baad saade barab baje sahajanwaan main ek jansabha ko sambodhit karenge
 After this at 2 pm, Indraprastha will reach the lawn to address the public of rural assembly of Gorakhpur
 siem yogi sava teen baje circuit house pahunchenge

 tisare morche ke rup main tamaam kshetreey dalon ko saath lekar gaiyr-congress, gaiyr-bijepi vikalp taiyaar karne kii vam dalon kii koshish phir se paravaan chadh rahi he
 Interestingly, the CPM also wants to include the Aam Aadmi Party in this front
 sipiem mahasachiv prakaash karaat ke mutabik, is silsile main agle hafte 11 dal dilli main milenge
 The name and vision of this new front will also be announced on 25 February
 isamen 11 raajnneetik dal shaamil honge
 The CPM general secretary also wants to include Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party in this front
 karaat ne kaha ki agar aam aadmi party ruchi dikhaati he, to vah bhi is siyaasi gathjod main jagah paa sakati he
 If this happens then the scene in West Bengal, once the impregnable fort of CPM, will be quite interesting
 kyonki yahaan sipiem kii dhur virdohi trinmul congress kii mamata banerjee sarkaar chalaa rahi hai or kabhi arvind kejariwal ke raajnneetik guru rahe anna hajaare unke paksh main prachaar karne kaa elaan kar chuke hai
 But the impact of the AAP not outside Delhi, Prakash Karat said while referring to the Aam Aadmi Party that we considered him a non-congress, non-bjp party
 magar mushkil he ki dilli main shandaar kamyaabi hasil karne vaali yah party sirf khud ko hi shudd or raajnneetik rup se eemaandaar maanati he
 Prakash said that Aam Aadmi Party is Delhi-centric
 mujhe nahin lagata ki yah rashtriya str par koi asar daal paaegi
 According to the CPM General Secretary, the Left parties of the country have been raising their voice on the issues on which the Aam Aadmi Party is vocal
 koun-koun hoga is tisare morche menvam dalon kii baat karen to bhartiya communist party (sipiai) or marxvaadi communist party (sipiem) is nae morche kii dhuree honge
 Apart from this, Jayalalithaa's AIADMK, which recently formed an alliance with the Left to Tamil Nadu, the ruling Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh, the Janata Dal United governing in Bihar, Naveen Patnaik's Biju Janata Dal in Orissa, JDS of Karnataka, Part of the Left alliance may include Forward Bloc, Assam Gana Parishad and Babu Lal Marandi's Jharkhand Vikas Morcha
 philhal haath hai 90 sitenmaujuuda loksabhaa kii baat karen to isamen is sambhavit morche ke dalon ke paas 90 loksabhaa siten hai
 Will this front also coordinate seats across the country
 is sawaal par prakaash karaat ne sidhaa jawaab nahin diya
 He said that the character of this front is federal
 isamen zyaadaatar kshetreey raajnneetik dal hai, jinka ek pradesh vishesh main zyada janaadhar he
 Our aim is to bring all these together and provide an alternative at the national level
 ham ek duusare ko har mumkin chunavi madad muhaiyaa karaayenge

 Mohammed Shami, Mohit Sharma and Umesh Yadav have emerged as superstars from Team India in this World Cup
 kisi kaa yogadan kisi se kam nahin

 She was unconscious at a hospital in Lahore for about a month
 paan kii shaukeen or bhare swar kii malkin, 66 varshiya reshma ko arsa pehle gale main cancer kaa pataa chalaa tha
 Sitting in the neck, this enemy finally took them along
 shaayad vah bhi divaana ho gaya ho is banjaaran kii puranur aawaaj kaa
 Millions of people will remember him for singing Chaar Dina Ka Pyar o Rabba in the 1983 film Subhash Ghai's Hero, excluding the music enthusiasts in India

 The song was Ankhiya nu rahne de ankhian de kol kol
 (raaj kapur ne isi gane kii dhun par bobi main lata mangeshkar se gavaaya tha ankhiyon ko rahane de ankhiyon ke aasapaas)
 The capricious Sufi singer had to plead with Ghai to persuade him to sing for the film
 hindi cinema ko waisi aawaaj phir nahin mili
 She used to respect Lata Mangeshkar like her sister
 vaise unki paidaaish to hindustan kii hi thi
 She was born in 1947 in Ratangarh area of churu district of Rajasthan, but after a month of partition, her clan of Banjaras went to Pakistan
 gayikee main unhone koi aupchaarik talim nahin lee thi
 His charming voice was just a gift from God

 He sang Sufi Kalam of Punjabi, Hindi and Urdu
 unki jindagi nihaayat saadagi vaali thi or bolchaal main ve nihaayat jindadil thim
 It was not her habit to memorize songs but it was her commitment to singing that she remembered and sang them
 unamem bacchon jaisi ek maasoomiyat thi, jo unki sohabat / sampark main aane vaale har aadmi ko apana bana leti
 That is why he was awarded the big civilian honor sitara-e-imtiaz in Pakistan
 reshma kii aawaaj gam or udaasi ke lahaze main sani hoti thi
 And when she sang with a full throat, she would cover her entire environment in the same sadness
 ve dil se gaati thim or apni mausiki se unhen gaharaa lagaav tha
 She had truly become a major force for folk music going through bad times
 ve jaise dharti se footati ek aawaaj thim
 Used to sing music associated with clay
 apni aawaaj main ve ek meetha dard gholti thim
 His Gaia Sada Chidiya da Chamba is an example of this
 kai baar to unhen sunate-sunate shrotaaon kii aankh main aansu aa jate
 She is still the biggest singer of Pakistan to be heard on youtube
 vahaan unke bare main kii gayi shrotaaon kii tippaniyan bhi unke kad kaa ehsaas dilaa detii hai
 There was a cut on his forehead between the eyebrows, which would look like a pagoda bell
 or dekhie ki unki aawaaj main bhi ghanti ke swar kii anugunj saaf prathit hoti thi
 He had a heartfelt love for India
 sangeet ke aayojanon main jab-tab ve aati hi rahati thim
 Aman wanted peace between the two countries

 Do not divide them

 sirf aresas ke vichaaron ke liye kaam kar rahi he
 Many of the questions raised on PM Modi were asked by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, why did he not speak when there was an attack during Kanhaiya's appearance in the Patiala House Court Campus? Why did you keep silent when professors, students and journalists were attacked? Is this what your ideology teaches you? Why don't you like to listen to others' opinions or their views? Salute the relationship with the flag, not the clothes
 Rahul said, "when i salute the flag, i salute the relationship, not the clothes, which this flag represents
" jab main uski raksha karata hum tab desh ke harek akele or kamjor shaks kii aawaaj or raay kii raksha karata hum

 Yoga guru Ramdev alleged that Congress is responsible for the widespread corruption and it should be uprooted from the country in the national interest
 tippaniyan Criticizing the Congress-led UPA government for approving foreign direct investment (FDI) in many sectors, he said that huge amount of money deposited in the form of black money abroad was coming into the country in the form of FDI

 Taking a dig at both the Center and the state government for failing to deal with the Uttarakhand tragedy, Ramdev said that Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi was busy celebrating somewhere in the hour of crisis

 Input: IANS uttar pradesh main congress ne brahman jati kaa daav kya chalaa ki ab jati kii beemaari party cader ke bheetar hi ghar karti ja rahi he
 When the Congress party played the card of 'brahmin Chief Minister' with the name and face of Sheila Dixit, now the potential candidates are also starting to wave the 'brahmin candidates' in their areas
 jo congress khud ko jati or panth viheen rajnatik dal hone kaa daawa pichley ek sau saal se karti aa rahi he us party kaa ye myth uttar pradesh chunaav ke pehle hi tuutane laga he
 Such a poster of the Congress's 'brahmin candidate' is rarely seen in any election, but Uttar Pradesh is full of such posters
 shila dikshit ko khuleam bade-bade postaron main na sirf brahman ummidavaar likhaa ja rahaa he balki kai sthaneey netaa khud ko sambhavit ummidavaar bataate hue garv se apane ko brahman ummidavaar likh rahe hai or bade-bade poster chowk-chauraahon par laga rahe hai
 However, this poster is not an authorized poster of the party
 brahman jati kii party bani congresspurvanchal ke baliya shahar main congress ke aisepostaronki bharmaar he, inhen dekhne se ek baargi aisa lagane laga he ki congress desh kii sabase badi rajnatik party na hokar brahman jati kii party hokar rah gai he
 In these posters, from the Chief Minister to the candidates, they are also openly demonstrating their respective Brahmins
 maathe par tilak, gale main rudraksh kii maala sareekhe aise pratik chinh bhi dekhne ko mil rahe hai jo bataa rahe hai ki congress is chunaav main bahman card kaa dhadlle se istemaal kar rahi he
 While advancing such a hopeful Dixit from the Congress, it was in the mind of the Congress high command that if the party had to stand in UP, it would have to raise votes on the basis of Brahmin card
 yahi vajah he ki party kaa cader ab khuleam ise pradarshit karne laga he
 It is difficult to say how much the party will benefit from this, but there is definitely a possibility of loss because no one from the party like Congress had expected such use of caste card
 baharhaal pike yani prashanth kishor ke is formule par chalakar congress itani aage nikal chuki he ki yahaan se waapas lautnaa bhi sambhav nahin he

 Former Judge Markandey Katju said, "I eat beef and do not consider cow as mother

 Sadhvi Prachi of Vishwa Hindu Parishad said that similar action should be taken against those who eat beef
 vaise, aresas ko shaayad is baat par koi aitraaj nahin ki jarurat padane par gaay kaa khun piya ja saktaa he, jaisaa ki kenya ke log karte hai
 Suddenly, reports of violence in the name of cow started becoming common
 19 aktubar ko kashmir ke nirdaleey vidhayak ejeeniyar raashid ke munh par dilli main syaahi daal di gai

 The cow also made public such aspects of many people, who revolve around her
 uttar pradesh ke bijepi netaa sangeet singh som bif niryaat karne vaali company ke saajheedaar rah chuke hai
 India is one of the largest beef exporters in the world under Narendra Modi, who has been abusing the UPA for the Pink Revolution before coming to power
 yoga guru ramdev chaahate hai ki modi puure desh main uttar pradesh jaisaa gohatya virdohi kanoon lagu kar den, jisase bif par hone vaali gandi raajnneeti puri tarah khatm ho jaaegi
 But the BJP is not in its favor
 vaise, 29 main se 24 rajyon main gohatya par pratibandh he
 Racism also started appearing in the debate over cow
 aaryon ko videshi maanane vaale dalit varg ke kuch logon kii daleel thi ki gaay bhens ke mukaable kam doodh detii he, phir bhi bechaari bhens or uske vansh ko kaatane kii chhot he
 If a cow is similar, then it is very simple, but the black letter buffalo is equal, instead of the buffalo bean, buffalo puffed, after all what is the joke of a native animal? They say that those who call Mahish (buffalo) as demons have spread food fascism
 isi food fasism ke virodh main pork or bif festival yojit karne kaa prastaav rakhaa gaya
 In this annual festival, many times people have to eat police sticks instead of beef
 lekin karnataka ke raibag tehseeldaar offis main vishwa maanavadhikaar diwas kii purv sandhya par karnataka praja vedike ne bif party yojit kii or uske kaaryakarta yah kehete hue 10 kilo bif chat kar gaye ki yah unka sanvaidhanik adhikaar he
 It is difficult to guess how well the Indian cow is doing well, but some good decisions have been made on the pretext of that
 chunki dadri kaa maamla bihar chunaav ke samay hua tha, lihaaja iske jariye sampradayik dhruvikaran kii koi kasar nahin chodi gai
 And because of this, for the first time, the Election Commission has issued a new guideline for print media that no party will issue any advertisement without prior verification of the authorized media panel
 gaay ne hi yah bhi dikhaa diya ki police kaise kaam karti he
 a Hindu army worker complained to the Delhi Police that beef was served at Kerala House
