 In fact, some senior army officers are now seen to separate themselves from the letter written to the President
 unka kahana he ki rashtrati ramnath kovind ko likhi aisi kisi bhi chitthee yaa mail kaa unhone samarthan nahin kiya he
 However, one of these officers, Major General Sunil Wombatkere, in a special conversation with NDTV said that he does not understand why and under whose pressure his colleagues are saying this
 unhone enditivi se baat karte kaha ki main sach main yah nahin kah saktaa he ki vah ab raashtrapati ko likhe patr se khudako alag kyon kar rahe hai
 Maybe they have their own reasons for this and i respect them
 lekin maine is patr ko lekar in sabhi afasaron ko i-mail karke inaki sahmati lee thi
 Only then was this letter prepared
 purv airchif marshall nirmal chandra suri or sevanruvitt army chif general esef rodirgs is patr ko lekar apni sahmati jataai thi
 On Thursday, Wombatkare also dismissed the claim of these officials that they were not informed about the contents of the letter before sending an email to President Ramnath Kovind
 suri ne is mail ko saath ke saath dekha tha kyonki yah mail pehle sabhi ko ek saath bheja gaya tha
 Major General Sunil Wombatkere said that i cannot tell why it is being said on behalf of the President's tenure that he did not get any such match
 jabaki yah mail major priyadarshan choudhary kii taraf se raashtrapati bhawan ke teen mail adress par bheja gaya tha
 One of which mail id then presidentofindia @ rb

 tha
 i do not understand how they did not get the last mail
 purv air chif marshall ne kaha ki unka samarthan sandarbh main bahut vishisht tha
 He said that my statement was only in the context that the armed forces have to remain politically consistent and serve through a democratically elected government
 yah sab maine samarthan kiya he
 Chief Air Chief Marshal Suri refused to comment on Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath's alleged reference to the Indian Army as "modiji's Army (PM Narendra Modi's soldiers)", saying that he had enough on the issue i do not know
 "sena kaa kya matlab he? iskaa matlab he ki jo log aapkaa samarthan karte hai
 In this context, all the members of the BJP support their leader, and hence they can be called Modiji's army
 unhone kaha ki 2014 main jin logon ne unhen vot diya, ve modiji kii sena hai
 Prime Minister, he is the chief executive and therefore, we all are his army
 sashastr bal koi apwaad nahin hai
 The letter sent to the President said that it was "unacceptable" for the leaders, who take credit for military operations such as cross-border attacks and referred to the armed forces as "modiji's army"

 afasaron ke khaane ke liye vishesh vyanjan bhi taiyaar kiye gaye he
 So that the election officers called from different districts can be very hospitable
 iske liye kharchon kii koi limit tay nahin he or naa hi is ore dhyaan diya gaya he
 What other place can be better than Five Star Hotel so that election commission officials can feel good
 aisa nahin he ki raipur main paanch sitara hotalon ke samakaksh or koi duusare sarkari bhawan nahin he
 The grand air condition hall and facilities buildings and auditorium are lying vacant, but the Election Commission was pleased with the Five Star Hotel
 lihaaja chunaav kaary se jude afasaron kii baithken yaheen nipataai gai, lekin is five star hotel main kuch or bhi log pahunche the jinhen chunaav ayog kii phijul kharchi raas nahin ai
 According to local citizen Gaurav Sharma, there are luxurious government buildings in Raipur city
 riyayati daron par air condishan bhawan khud sarkaar uplabdh karaati he
 These buildings would have been available free of cost for election work, but the officers themselves have the habit of misusing the money of the government chest
 sthaneey naagarik sanjay pandey ke mutabik chunaav ayog ko janata ke dhan kaa dhyaan rakhana chahie
 According to him, the Jalsa of any political party in a five-star hotel makes sense, but not the Election Commission
 udhar, dilli se aae varisht chunaav ayukta umesh sinha se jab patrakaron ne five star hotel main baithak karne kaa makasad poocha to ve baglein jhaankne lage
 He dismissed it as a system of state government
 haalanki unhone mana ki five star hotel ke bajaae yah baithak kahin or bhi ho sakati thi
 Usually, the Election Commission advises political parties to stop unnecessary election expenses and to settle the election expenditure within the stipulated amount
 dhan ke beja istemaal par najar rakhane ke liye paryvekshak bhi niyukt karata he, lekin jab baari khud kii aati he, to sarkari bhawanon ke bajaae praathamikta five star hotalon ko di jaati he
 The Commission has its own arguments in this matter
 sarkari tijori se chalis hajaar rupye se adhik ke kharch ke liye afasaron ko nivida or tender jari karne hote hai, taaki pratiyogita ke jariye sarkaar ke dhan kii bachat ho
 But this did not happen in this case
 nirvachan ayog ne bagaiyr sarkari prakriya apanaae sidhe five star hotel main baithak bulavaa lee

 Like other jungles of the country, there has been talk of decreasing greenery in Palpur forests
 yahi kaaran rahaa he ki vahaan pakshiyon kii sankhya bhi kam thi
 Fayaz Khudtar, a student of zoology at the University of Jivaji, did research to find out the position of birds in the forest of Palpur Koon
 8 saal pehle khudtar ne apana shodh kaary shuru kiya tha or iske liye unhone 8 tarah ke pakshiyon ko apane shodh kaa vishay banaaya
 By the way, more than 56 types of birds are found here
 khudtar bataate hai ki unhone shodh kaary ke liye karnivor, fergivor, grenivor, insectivor, nectorfeader, amnivor, pisivor va plantivor naam vaale aath kism ke pakshiyon kaa chayan kiya
 For this, they made the density per square kilometer the basis
 jab unhone shodh kaary shuru kiya to prati varg kilometre main karnivor kaa ghanatv 0
 85 percent, Fernivore's density 5
 36 pratishat, grenivor kaa ghanatv 8
 11 percent, density of insectivore 4

 raav ke nirdesan main khudtar ne pakshiyon ke shodh kaary ke liye kul 35 centre banaae
 The birds coming to these centers were constantly assessed
 khudtar ke shodh kaary se is baat kaa khulaasa hua he ki palpur kunon main pichley aath varsho ke dauraan pakshiyon kii taadaad main ijapha hua he
 The density of the eight types of birds that he had formed has increased by almost four times
 dow
 Rao says that increasing density of birds is an indication that there is increased greenery, that is, forests
 unhone kaha ki yah baat swaabhaavik he ki pakshi kisi ilaake main tabhi jaaenge, jab unke khaane-pine ke liye vahaan kuch hoga
 He further said that the habitat from the sanctuary area has been reduced, this would also have increased the forest

 The hype has certainly ended but there is no such ban on social media
 soshal media ke sabhi plateform par vibhinn partiyon ke samarthak chunaav ke aakhri vakt tak ye ‘siyaasi ladaai’ ladate rahete hai
 Voting in Karnataka is now short, in such a situation a sensational letter is spreading on social media networks
 watrup group main bhi ise circulet kiya ja rahaa he
 What is written in the letter is very provocative on communal grounds
 chitthee ke mutabik catholic carch or karnataka main sattarudh congress sarkaar ne lingayat ko alag alpsankhyak dharm banane ke liye gupachup dhang se milakar kaam kiya
 The letter also claims an alleged roadmap according to which the Lingayat community was first to separate from the Hindus and then convert to Catholicism
 chitthee par 23 march 2018 kii taarikh darj he
 It has been written on behalf of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of India (CBCI) President His Eminence Oswald Cardinal Gracias
 chitthee ko arqbishap bangalore dow barnard moraas ke naam bhejnaa dikhaaya gaya he
 According to the letter, on December 21, 2013, representatives of the 'holy See' from Delhi met the ruling leadership of Karnataka for the first time and pressured them to demand separate religion status for Lingayats
 iske baad 'holi si' ke pratinidhiyon or karnataka sarkaar ke kartadhartaaon ke bich isi mudde ko lekar kai baithken huin
 'let us know that the' Holy See 'is used for the Pope
 chitthee main ye bhi kaha gaya he, 'karnataka main atmaaon kii samrudh fasal ke liye hamen kadi mehnat kerani chahie
 'the letter further states,' We can greatly admire the Lingayat faith for making inroads in Lingayat, but Catholics should never forget that according to any spiritual criteria, Lingayats cannot be equal to Catholicism and salvation can only be Being a Catholic can only be found
 'email kii shakl main is chitthee ko fasebuk or twitor par dakshinpanth kii ore jhukaav rakhane vaale kai logon ne post kiya he
 These include Swami Nischalananda
 phir in post par kai logon ko pratikriya main gusse kaa izhaar bhi karte dekha ja saktaa he
 They also say that this is a conspiracy by the Catholic Church to divide Hindus and then convert them to Christianity
 chitthee ko is tarah draft kiya gaya he ki wo catholic bishap conference of india ke do ahm padaadhikariyon ke bich vaastavik samvaad kii tarah dikhe
 But after careful inspection of the letter, it is clear that it is not a leaked letter but a fake letter which is being circulated on the eve of Karnataka elections to polarize the electorate to gain electoral advantage
 chitthee ko lekar kai aise sakshya hai jo isaki vishwasaneeyata par sawaal uthaate hai
 For example - 1
 chitthee hiz eminance oswald cardinal gracius kii ore se likhaa gaya bataaya gaya he jo CBCI ke adhyaksh hai
 But the email sent to the letter is shown by secretarygeneral @ cbci
 in he jo ki CBCI ke secretary general kaa email he
 There is no reason why the President has to use the email of the Secretary General for such important official communication
 2
 Typically, such letters are written on official letter pads and the signatures of the sender under them are also sent and sent as an attachment to the email
 uparokt kathith chitthee main ye teenon hi chizein nahin hai
 3
 uparokt email kaa formet un imels se alag he jo is email idi se bheji jaati hai
 When we contacted CBCI Secretary General Theodore Mascarenhas for confirmation, some forwarded emails came from his email
 unka formet farji chitthee ke formet se alag tha
 The format of the fake letter was- "date: 2018-03-23" 10
 30 gmt+0530”jabaki original mail se aae mail kaa formet is tarah tha
 "sent: Tuesday, February 13, 2018 5:19 PM"
 4
 There are many English spelling mistakes in fake letters
 aisi sambhaavna bahut kam he ki Catholic Bishops’ Conference of India ke adhyaksh kii aadhikarik chitthee main sanghathan ko hi thik se naa likhaa jaae
 The apostrophe (') has been misplaced in a fake letter
 ise Bishop’s likhaa gaya he
 (while it was supposed to be Bishops') 5
 farji chitthee main or bhi kai galtiyaa hai
 Such as-press urge them (not used correctly), rip rich harvest (right is reap rich harvest), persue (while right must be persuade)
 chitthee main artical ‘the’ bhi kai jagah nadaarad he
 At the beginning of the letter, it appears to be sent by the President of the CBCI but finally the letter sent by the Secretary General has been stated
 saaf he ki jisane bhi farji chitthee ko draft kiya use naamon ko lekar gafalat hui
 The CBCI has denied any such comments
 saath hi ise farji or sharartan iraade se likhaa bataaya he
 It has been said by CBCI - 'it is a cheap and mischievous trick to spread this letter just before the Karnataka elections
 jinhone bhi is chitthee ko gadha or failaayaa, ham unke khilaaf kanoonee karrwai kaa adhikaar surakshit rakhte hai
 We urge our well wishers to respond to this official clarification whenever such letter comes to you
 ishwar karnataka ko ashish de
 God bless our beloved country India

 bjp's PM in waiting Narendra Modi surrounded the Congress on the issue of corruption and said that his scams have hurt the dignity of the country
 unhone rajdhani dilli main ek raily main kaha ki upie sarkaar to koyale tak kii chori main lipt he
 In a rally in Dwarka, Narendra Modi attacked the Congress and said that so far many election symbols of the Congress have changed
 us party main sabakuch badla, par niyat nahin badali
 He said that the UPA government has been paralyzed
 modi ne betahasha badhati mahangaai ke liye pradhanmantri manmohan singh ko jimmedaar tehraate hue kaha ki unhone is masale par desh ke saamne kuch bhi bolnaa jaruri nahin samajha
 He said that despite inflation, the UPA government is not taking any step in the interest of the poor
 dilli kii shila dikshit sarkaar par hamale karte hue modi ne kaha ki kaamanwealth ghotaale se duniyabar main desh kii saakh giri
 He said that Sheila Dikshit's government did not even provide clean drinking water to the Delhiites
 nadiyon kii safai yojana kaa zikr karte hue modi ne misaal di ki 3900 karod rupee kharch karne ke baavjood yamuna maili hi rah gai, jabaki mahaj 900 karod rupee main sabarmati puri tarah saaf ho gai
 Modi appealed to the public not to support him in this election, who have been in power for 15 years, but did not do anything in the interest of the general public
 piem pad ke liye apni daavedaari ko jaij tehraate hue modi ne kaha ki jab jameen se jude kisi aam aadmi ko daayitv miltaa he, to vah din-raat jagakar desh kii samasyaon kaa hal khojataa he
 Taking a dig at the Gandhi family, Modi said that those who have been ruling for three generations, but are not paying attention to the development of the country, will teach them a lesson in elections
 modi ne logon se apil kii ki jab ve 4 taarikh ko vot daalane jaaen, to kuch chijen yaad karke jaaen
 Recall that the present Delhi Government made Delhi as a 'rape Capital'
 india get par nirbhaya ke liye, nari suraksha ke liye noujvaan raat-raat thand main guzaar rahe the, jabaki un par thande pani kii bauchhaar kar di gai
 In the Ramlila Maidan, the police are sent to commit crimes against people at night, the police beat up people and a woman is killed
 modi ne behad chutile andaaj main kaha ki vot dene jane se pehle gas silendar ko naman karnaa, pyaaj ko bhi naman karnaa
 The thinking of 'shahzade' versus the thinking of Modi
 Narendra Modi did not miss out on Rahul Gandhi even in this rally
 unhone kaha ki congress ke 'shahjade' kaa vichaar he ki bharat madhumakhi kaa chhatta he, jabaki hamaara vichaar he 'bharat'
 His view is that poverty is a state of mind, while the poor are poor for us
 unka vichaar he ki garibi kii raajnneeti na karen, to majaa nahin aata
 We think that suffering and suffering of the poor leads to sorrow
 modi ne kaha ki 'shahjade' kii soch he ki paise ped par nahin ugte
 Our thinking is that the money grows in the fields and barns and it is brought up by the sweat of existence
 unki soch he, samaaj ko todo or raaj karo
 Our thinking is, connect and develop the society
 unki soch he, raajnneeti sabakuch he
 Our thinking is nationalism is everything
 unki soch he, satta kaise bachaaen
 Our thinking is, how to save the country
 modi ne kaha ki shahjade kii soch unhen hi mubarak
 This is the thinking, due to which Hindustan has seen the dream of Congress-free India

 gandhivadi kaaryakarta anna hajaare ne maharashtra ke mukhyamantri prithviraj chavaan ke bayaan par unase sawaal kiya he ki kya sirf chunaav ladane vaale hi bhrashtachar ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaa sakate hai
 The Gandhian activist said, 'now it is being said that Anna should contest the election
 kya iskaa arth yah he ki jo bhi bhrashtachar ke khilaaf bol rahaa he use chunaav ladanaa hoga? yadi aisa he to desh ke 120 karod logon ko chunaav main khadaa hona chahie, uske baad hi vah bhrashtachar ke khilaaf bol sakenge
 He said that politicians have contested elections but nobody has done anything to curb corruption
 hajaare ne kaha, ‘pichley 62 saalon main aapane aisa kanoon nahin banaaya jo bhrashtachar se nibat sake
 This reaction of the Gandhian activist has come to Chavan's statement that he said it was 'clear' that Hazare's allies want to enter politics
 unhone unase khulkar saamne aane ko kaha
 Chavan had said, 'if you want to participate in politics, you join it, politics will prosper
 ab yah spasht he ki unke sahyogi raajnneeti main aana chaahate hai
 'he had said,' He should take a clear stand, either contest elections or support someone
 lekin naakaaratmak ruukh apnaane kaa koi arth nahin he ki agar vidheyak (janalokapal) paarit nahin hua to ham virodh karenge (congress kaa virodh karange)

 It mentions political movements including the revolt of Dalits
 film kii safalataa taliva yani netaa ke taur par is super star ke liye makul vakt par ai thi
 Earlier in 2010, his science fiction film Antiran, under the direction of Shankar, made a huge hit at the box office

 ravikumar kii linga (2016) kii naakaami ke chalate is superstar ko prashansakon se maafee maangani padi or unhone vitarakon ko unke nuksaan kii bharpai bhi kii thi
 There was speculation then that Rajinikanth might retire now after a brilliant career of three decades
 tamil darshakon kii ruchi badal rahi thi or taliva ko chupchaap baithkar nae sire se sochna padaa tha
 The superstar desperately needed something new to make a comeback
 unhone yuva or varisht film nirmaataaon se kahaniyaan mangavayin
 At the same turn, 36-year-old Pa
 ranjit kaa pravesh hota he, jinhone 2014 main kaamyaab siyaasi acshan film madras banaai thi
 Ranjith, who was once an assistant to director Venkat Prabhu, debuted with Atakati, a romantic comedy and carved a distinct identity with political thinking
 unki ek alag dalit pahchaan ban gai jo naastik he or un muddon ko uthaata he jo tamilnadu or puure bhartiya samaaj se jude hai
 His second film with Rajinikanth is Kaala
 is film main 67 varshiya rajnikant ne mumbai ke dharavi main rahane vaale ek tamil don karicalan kii bhoomika nibhaai he jo garibon ke haq ke liye ladata he
 Wearing a black lungi, he walks with special style
 uski pasand kaa kaala rang mehanatakash varg kaa pratik he jabaki khalanaayak jaisi bhoomika main hari dada (jisaki bhoomika naanaa patekar ne kii he) jhak safed rang ke kapade pahentaa he
 Ranjith says, "karikalan speaks only one or two sentences but with full confidence
 '' ve bataate hai, "kai baar rajnikant ne kuch samvaad bolne or kuch drishyon ko karne se manaa kar diya tha
 He felt that those dialogues did not match his character
 unhone kaha, "karikaalan aisa nahin kar saktaa he
 "and people accuse me that i did not give blatant dialogues to Rajinikanth
 ''shuruyatsuperstar ke saath ranjit ke sampark kaa shrey saundarya ko jaataa he, jinase unki mulaakaat 2010 main venkat kii film goa ke set par hui thi
 Earlier, he knew that he was writing the film's story for this veteran actor
 ranjit kehete hai, "ve madras dekh chuke the or unhen film bahut acchhee lagi thi
 He had faith in my work
 ''kabali main kai chijen ekadam nai thim
 Rajinikanth, who had been avoiding playing an older character till now, played the role of an old man in it
 ranjit kehete hai, "kabali darasal rajnikant kii baaki filmon se alag thi
 Rajni did not have many known faces in it
 usamen unki ek jawan beti thi or isamen raajnneeti kaa rang tha
 His fans were a bit shocked by this film
 ve mere paas aate or poochhate the, "aapane rajnikant ke saath yah kya kar diya?'' kabali ko mishrit pratikriya mili lekin box offis par moti kamai hui
 In his second innings with second innings Superstar, Ranjith looks smarter than before and raises more mature issues
 ve kehete hai, "is baar main rajnikant ke prashansakon kii ore se mili aalochanaon ko lekar sachet tha or kuch alag karnaa chahta tha
 This time i wanted to raise more vivid issues like land rights and eviction of slums, as well as presenting Rajinikanth in a different form to the audience
 '' unhen is film kii prerana kai baton se mili, jinamein 1985 main jhuggivaasiyon kii jindagi par anand patavardhan kii documentry bombai avar city bhi shaamil thi
 Ranjith says, "mumbai is a city that is horizontal and high in height
 oonchai badhati he to kshaitij gaayab ho jaataa he
 Those who were brought to make the city beautiful have now become unwanted
 ''ranjit ne yahaan kii samasyaayein or yahaan kii jindagi samajhane ke liye chah maheene jhuggiyon ke aasapaas ghoomte or logon se baatcheet karte gujaarey the
 He explains, "I wanted to make a film set there (mumbai) because there is cultural diversity there
 main ise keval tamil film nahin bananaa chahta tha
 He met Gujaratis, people of Maharashtra and other communities there
 tabhi to isamen naanaa patekar, huma kuraishi, anjali patil or pankaj treepathi jaise bollywood ke kalakaar hai
 Political Ranger Rajinikanth announced to enter active politics on December 31, 2017
 us samay kaala kaa nirmaan chal rahaa tha
 Tamil audiences eagerly await the film which will indicate their political ideology
 ab tak rajani ne yahi kaha he ki unki rajnatik yatra aadhyatmik hogi
 How did Ranjith react to his announcement
 ve bataate hai, "ham raajnneeti par kaaphi charchaaen kar chuke hai
 Rajni sir is aware of my Ambedkarite ideology
 ''ek rajnatik film, do alag-alag vichaardhaaraein or bhavi rajaneta, kya yah santulan kaa sanket he? ranjit jawaab dete hai, "film main koi badlaav nahin he
 i have always been interested in politics, but not electoral
 logon kii samasyaon ko uthaanaa jaruri he or rajani sar ne film kii kahani main kisi tarah kaa dakhal nahin diya he
 "when Rajinikanth is coming into a new role as a politician, Kala will be investigated more deeply
 haal hi main sterlite virodh pradarshnon main police golibari ke baad thutukudi ke apane daure main rajnikant ne hinsa ke liye asaamaajik tatwon ko jimmemedaar tehraaya tha
 He had said, "if there is a protest for everything, Tamil Nadu will be transformed into a burial ground
 '' 2 june ko kannada samarthak kaaryakartaaon ne kaveri management board ke gathan kaa samarthan karne ke kaaran rajnikant kii film par pratibandh lagane kii maang kii thi
 It remains to be seen whether Kala will be released in Karnataka, and what Rajinikanth does for Tamil Nadu as a politician
 lekin ranjit kaa kahana he ki ve philhal rukne vaale nahin
 He says, "I will keep making political films, films that solve people's social problems
" ''*** a constitutional law expert, with condition of anonymity, said, "the NCP has duly informed the Governor's office, where it has been taken on record as there is no legislature at present
" prabhavi rup se ajit pavaar ensipi ke vidhayak dal ke netaa nahin he or is vajah se unki kisi bhi karrwai kaa ab koi parinaam nahin hoga
 "the pro tem speaker is usually the most senior elected legislator
 use rajyapal bies koshyari dwaara niyukt kiya janaa he or shapath dilaai jaani he
 The Protem Speaker will administer the oath to all 287 mlas except himself
 visheshgy ne kaha, "sattarudh party ke liye vidhansabha adhyaksh kaa chunaav, vidhansabha ke patal par pehle raajnneetik va sanvaidhanik pareekshan ke liye maarg prashast karegaa
 In this case, BJP and Ajit Pawar will claim the support of NCP mlas and Assembly Speaker will be elected
 anyathaa, sarkaar apane aap gir jaaegi
 "if that happens, then the government led by Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis will be a mere formality of the vote of confidence
 vartmaan sankhya bal ke daawey ke anusaar, bhaajapa ne 170 se zyada vidhayakon ke samarthan kaa daawa kiya he
 This includes 105 BJP mlas and independents and small parties who allegedly support Ajit Pawar
 duusari taraf shivasena-congress-rakanpa ne bhi 165 se zyada vidhayakon ke samarthan kaa daawa kiya he
 The total number of mlas in the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly is 288
 isamen vidhansabha adhyaksh bhi shaamil hai
 The expert added that combining the two claims creates a situation where the total number of mlas who support is more than the number of elected members of the Legislative Assembly, so one of the claims is misleading or false
 or, yah vidhansabha adhyaksh ke chunaav main puure desh ke saamne aa jayega
 Bhanwarlal Sharma, a Congress MLA from Sardar city in Rajasthan, has been suspended from the party for attacking party vice-president Rahul Gandhi
 pradesh congress pravaktaa da
 Archana Sharma said, 'state President Sachin Pilot has suspended MLA Bhanwar Lal Sharma on the instructions of General Secretary of All India Congress and state in-charge Gurudas Kamath
 ' Of the 200 Vidhan Sabha members of Rajasthan, Bhanwar Lal Sharma is representing Sardarshahar Assembly Constituency among 21 Congress Members
 sharma ne shanivaar ko congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ke netritv par sawaal khadey karte hue aarope lagaae the ki vah aise logon se ghir gaye the jinke paas raajnneeti kii samaj nahin he
 Describing Rahul Gandhi as not worthy of the post of vice-president of the party, he had said, "rahul is the MD of the Joker's company and Congress President Sonia Gandhi should change the party democratically and leave son Moh
 ' Sharma, who had represented the party six times in the Rajasthan Legislative Assembly, had called Rahul Gandhi responsible for the crushing defeat of the Congress in the Lok Sabha elections in Rajasthan
 nitish kumaar ne buudhvaar ko janata dal united (JDU) ke rashtriya adhyaksh ke rup main apana doosraa kaarykaal shuru kiya
 With the start of the second innings, the party seems to be taking the urn from its old stand of not joining the central government
 jediu ke rashtriya mahasachiv kasee tyaagi (KC Tyagi) ne dilli main ek samvaadadaata sammelan main kaha ki agar sankhya bal ke aadhaar par centre sarkaar main bhagidaari milti he or NDA ke sheersh netaa pradhanmantri narendra modi or grih mantri amit shah ke dwaara prayaas kiya jaataa he to vah iskaa swaagat karegi
 KC Tyagi's statement is being interpreted as being straightforward that the Janata Dal is not firm on its stand of not joining the United Union Cabinet
 vah mantrimandal main shaamil hona chaahati he, lekin sankethik pratinidhiyon ke aadhaar par nahin, balki apni rashtriya adhyaksh nitish kumaar ke puraane anupatik pratinidhitiv kii maang ke aadhaar par
 In fact, the leaders of the party say that the top leadership is estimating that whenever there is a solution to the stalemate in forming a government with the Shiv Sena in Maharashtra, then it may be proposed to the Army from the BJP that in the Union Cabinet it will give its Increase the representation and then Janata Dal United does not want to stay behind
 uskaa akalan he ki aisi paristhiti main shaayad BJP bhi chaahegi ki janata dal united kendriya mantrimandal main shaamil ho
 Hence, JDU has now put the ball in the court of BJP in a way by making public its talk
 jisase agar vah janata dal united ke anupatik pratinidhitiv kii maang ko maane bhi to uskaa shrey pradhanmantri narendra modi or amit shah ko jaae
 At the same time, Janata Dal United wants to send a message to its workers and leaders that Nitish Kumar's words were finally accepted
 duusari taraf janata dal united ke netaaon kaa bhi kahana he yah sabakuch maharashtra kii raajnneeti or bjp-shivasena ke bich aane vaale dinon main satta main bhagidaari ke mudde par hone vaale samjhaute ke upar nirbhar karata he
 BJP leaders say that surely after this stand of Janata Dal United, the deadlock caused by Nitish Kumar's public statement on this issue will end
 unka kahana he ki jab se bihar main bhaajapa nitish sarkaar main shaamil hui he tab se pradhanmantri narendra modi nitish kumaar ko 2019 loksabhaa chunaav ke purv bhi 2017 main sarkaar main shaamil hone kaa nyotaa de chuke hai
 The rate of increase in oil imports in India will be less this year
 is anumaan se bhale hi sarkaar ke khajaane par bhaar ho, lekin yah desh main lambii aarthik susti kaa sanket he
 According to a government report, just 3 in oil imports this year
 5 fisadi kii vruddhi hone kaa anumaan he
 India has to import more than 80 per cent of its oil needs, in such a situation, due to low oil imports, demand and consumption are slowing down
 news agency ieenes ke anusaar, petroleum mantralay ke adheen petroleum planning and analysis cell (pipiasi) ne kaha he ki desh kaa tel aayaat vitt varsh 2019 ke 22
 23 in 2020 as against 7 million tonnes
 3 karod ton rah saktaa he
 The sluggish oil import rate is good news for the government exchequer, but lower crude oil imports will give less oil to Indian refineries and reduce consumption of petrol, diesel and aircraft fuel (ATF)
 varsh 2018 kii shuruyaat main sudhaar ke baad bhartiya arthvyavastha main phir vitt varsh 2018-19 kii teesri timahi main susti dekhi gai or sakal gharelu utpaada (jidipi) vikaas dar ghatakar 6
 Came down to 6 percent
 arthvyavastha main ai susti ke kaaran vitt varsh 2019 main aarthik vikaas dar anumaan 7
 Reduced from 2 per cent to seven per cent
 antarrashtriya agenciyon ne bhi bharat kii aarthik vikaas dar anumaan vitt varsh 2020 main ghataakar 7
 Has released an estimate of 3 percent
 yojana ayog ke ek purv sadsy ne naam nahin jaahir karne kii shart par ieenes se kaha, 'tel aayaat kii dar kam hone se bharat ke tel aayaat bill main katautee hogi or isse chaalu khaataa ghaataa kaa prabandhan karne main madad milegi, lekin yah tel ke maujuuda daam kaa ek kaaran hoga
 If the price of crude oil rises due to tensions in the Gulf countries, it may slow the country's economy further
 'gauratlab he ki khud vitt mantralay kii naveenatam masik aarthik report main yah baat sweekaar kii gai he ki niryaat target ke mutabik na hone, nijee khapat ummid se kam or phixd investment main naram badhat kii vajah se vitt varsh 2018-19 main bhartiya arthvyavastha kii raftaar sust padi he
 However, the Finance Ministry also says that the outlook for the economy remains positive due to the rise in the stock market and the decrease in inflation, and the economy will continue to grow well
 report ke anusaar, rigerv bank ne is calendar saal main hi repo rate main aadha fisadi kii katautee kar di he, lekin bank kam daron kaa phayda graahakon ko nahin mila he
 Due to the default by companies like IL&FS Group, the liquidity situation has been tight in the last six months, due to which banks are not able to reduce the loan rate much
 janvari-march 2019 main jidipi growth main giravat ke saath hi nijee khapat main bhi giravat ai he
 But the government has not increased its spending
 iske pehle asian vikaas bank or antarrashtriya mudra kosh jaisi antarrashtriya sansthaaen bhi bhartiya arthvyavastha main jidipi main growth ke anumaan ko ghataya he
 ADB stated that the growth rate of Indian economy in FY 2020
7
 2 fisadi hi rahegi
 The IMF estimates that the growth rate of the Indian economy in 2019-20 is 7
 3 fisadi rahegi, jo 2020-21 main badhkar 7
 Will reach 5 percent
 unhone aage kaha, 'iske alaava real estate ko udyog kaa darja milanaa chahie
 People associated with this sector have long been demanding that real estate be given industry status
 aisa hone se bainkon evam anya vittiya sansthaanon se aarthik madad milane main aasaani hogi
 Due to the status of the industry, the loan will be available at a low cost, which will benefit the consumer

 The police immediately rushed to the spot as soon as the news was received

 At the same time, the police find that both of them were not injured by being hit by a train despite being lying next to the railway track, rather they were bled by someone with knives
 hamalaavaron ne ladki ke pet main jahaan kareeb paanch se chah baar chaakuon se hamalaa kiya tha or ladke ko ek baar chaaku maaraa gaya tha
 However, in this case, the police was surprised for the first time when he tried to talk to the person giving telephone information about this incident again, because then the mobile phone of the tax caller was mysteriously switched off

 He went and started mistreating his girlfriend
 uske saath gangrape karne kii koshish kii, jiskaa virodh karne par chaaron ne donon par hamalaa chaakuon se hamalaa kar diya, lekin jab is hamale se uski premika kii haalat zyaada bighad gai to chaaron hi un donon ko maukey par chhod kar vahaan se faraar ho gaye
 The entire incident was about to make a mess
 ek aisa vaakya jise sunate hi kisi ke bhi jehan main dilli ke 16 disambar vaale gangrape kii yaad taaja ho jaati, lekin yahaan police ko kai baaten lagaataar khatak rahi thim
 One of them was not able to get the police to talk to the person giving news of this incident despite a million attempts and the other was about this despite being such a big crime between this railway track passing through a dense residential area
 Nobody even got news
 jakhmi hone kii vajah se police vaardaat kaa shikaar hue ladke se zyaada poochtacha to nahin kar sakati thi, lekin jab police ne uski kapadon or saamaan kii jaanch kii, to uske bag se mili ek kaagaj ke purje ne achaanak ne hi jaise sari kahani saaf kar di, kyonki ye poorja kuch or nahin balki ek suicide note tha
 But if it was a double suicide attempt, then who were the boys who tried to commit life with these two? So was that story of attempted gangrape and stabbing a gimmick? After all, the suicide note from the injured boy's bag had overturned the whole story
 isi bich police ko ek or chaunkaanewaali baat pataa chali
 He noticed that there is a deep stab of the knife in the boy's stomach, but neither the knife is on his jacket, nor on the shirt nor on the vest
 ab sawaal ye tha ki aakhir koi hamalavar kisi ke kapadon ko karaab kiye bagaiyr uske pet main chaaku kaise maar saktaa he?jab in donon main se ek yani ladke ke paas se police ko ek suicide note mila, to sari kahani takreeban saaf ho gai
 In the suicide note found from the boy's bag, it was written that the work he is going to do is shameful and disgusting, but since he has been abused by the boy's family members
 isliye wo aisa karne ko majaboor he
 From this suicide note, it was now clear that perhaps the boy tried to kill himself after stabbing his girlfriend with knives and when he failed in this attempt, he himself In order to protect the law from the eyes of Delhi, it made a story exactly like Delhi's 16 December
 police ko ladke par shaq to pehle hi ho chukaa tha, lekin suicide note kaa milanaa, chaakuon ke waar kii pench, kahani main maujuud kai jhol
 All these things were turning the suspicion of the police into confidence, but then another evidence came out that completely satisfied the police
 ye subut tha, wo mobile phone jo police ko phone karne ke baad se hi swissd of ho gaya tha
 When the police investigated, this mobile phone came out of Birbal Prasad, who tried to commit suicide and it was recovered from him
 yani apni premika par or khud par chaakuon se waar karne ke baad khud birbal ne hi police ko phone kar apane bare main bataaya tha or uljhane kii koshish kii thi

 Input: IANS sabir ali ko bijepi main shaamil karne ke baad machaa bavaal aakhirkaar unki sadsyta khatm karne tak pahunch gaya
 The BJP told the press conference on Saturday afternoon at around 3
15 pm that the BJP had ended its membership of Sabir Ali
 jediu se nikaale gaye sabir ali shuukravaar ko hi bijepi main shaamil hue the
 BJP Spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad said that the National President of the party, Rajnath Singh wants the party leaders to speak in the party forum itself
 sabir ali aakhir kiski pasand the? kya bihar bijepi, nitish kumaar ko aainaa dikhaane ke liye sabir ali kaa istemaal karnaa chaahati thi yaa phir sabir ko sachmuch modi ke gungan kaa inaam mila tha
 Whatever the reason, Sabir's membership was in a tizzy after falling into the BJP
 ek khemaa ab bhi sabir ali kii vakaalat kar rahaa he to susheel modi kheme ko koi jabaab nahin sujh rahaa
 Modi is now clarifying that there is no case against Sabir Ali
 sabir ali ne jaise hi apni sadsyta lambit rakhane kii chitthee jari kii, dilli bijepi netaaon ne jarur raahat kii saans lee hogi
 But winds have started blowing on the face of Bihar BJP
 susheel modi ne sabir ali ko nitish ke khilaaf bada kaich samajha tha par dilli ke netaaon ne susheel modi ke is faisle par pani pher diya
 Sushil Modi said that Sabir Ali himself has requested to postpone his decision, after the inquiry, the decision will be taken again
 bijepi rashtriya upaadhyaksh mukhtaar abbaas nakvi ne vivaad badhane ke baad sabir ali ke bare main kiya gaya apana twit to hataa liya he, lekin ve ab bhi apane bayaan par kaayam hai
 He said whatever i said about Sabir Ali, i still stand by him, i am still saying that he should be fired by the party
 unhone kaha maine apana twit isliye hataaya kyonki isamen daaud ibrahim kaa naam tha
 i later thought that i should not have used Dawood's name
 unhone kaha lekin sabir ali ko bijepi main shaamil kiye jane ko lekar meraa virodh ab bhi jari he
 Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi had strongly opposed the involvement of Sabir Ali, saying that now Dawood too can join BJP soon
 bijepi netaa balbir punj bhi sabir ali ke party main shaamil hone se naaraaz hai, haalanki purv party adhyaksh nitin gadakari kaa kahana he ki congress ko haraane ke liye sabhi kaa saath aana jaruri he
 He has welcomed Sabir Ali to the BJP
 sabir ke masale par mukhtaar abbaas nakvi kii naaraazgi kaa andaja isi baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki unhone khule taur par twitor par hi apni bhadaas nikaal di
 Though seeing the matter hot, he deleted his tweet on Saturday morning, but the protest remains firm
 seepi thakur sareekhe netaaon ko bhi sabir ali main koi kami nahin dikhti, ulte unke mutabik ‘namo’ ke lahar main sabko sawari karnaa chahie
 CP Thakur said that while we were not avoiding him while in JDU, why should we be avoided when we join BJP
 baharhaal ye to tay ho gaya ki sabir ali ko party main lene main bihar ke bijepi netaaon kaa bada role tha, lekin dilli ke netaaon kaa virodh is faisle par baari pad gaya
 In such a situation, now the BJP will have to think many times before including other leaders in the party

 There is only a short time left for the election campaign in Karnataka to stop
 aise main prachaar ke is aakhri fez main netaaon kii tabadatod reliyaan ho rahi hai
 On Wednesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the rally in Kolar, Karnataka
 raily main piem modi ne congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi par jamkar hamalaa bolaa or pradhanmantri pad ko lekar die gaye unke bayaan par bhi palatwaar kiya
 These 10 big attacks on the Congress by the Prime Minister in Bangarpet rally
 
 
 1
 This election will decide the future of Karnataka for the coming five years
 2
 Rahul's statement shows Namdar's arrogance
 koi kaise apane aap ko pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar ghoshit kar saktaa he
 3
 piem modi ne kaha ki congress ke namdaar, sone kaa chammach lekar paidaa hue hai or ye sona bhi videsh vaala he
 4
 modi ko hataane ke liye gathbandhan kii meeting chal rahi he, bade-bade diggajon ke pair pakade ja rahe hai
 Keeping all these veterans in the dark and declaring themselves PM is mistrust in the coalition itself
 5
 Naamdar should not have faith in fellow leaders of the alliance, whose ego has reached the seventh sky, will the people of the country accept such 'immature Namdar'
 6
 Congress has put Karnataka's reputation in the soil
 deshbhar ke logon ko congress ke karnaamon kaa pataa chal rahaa he, isliye deshbhar se congress ko vidaai di ja rahi he
 7
 raily ko sambodhit karte hue piem modi ne kaha ki congress jab sarkaar main aati he to wo maanati he ki janata ne unhen bhrashtachar karne kaa contract diya he
 8
 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki chaar saal baad bhi congress apni haar nahin sweekaar paa rahi he, congress sansad nahin chalane de rahi he or loktantr kii dhajjiyaan uda rahi he
 9
 unhone kaha ki naa hi congress dil vaali he, naa daliton vaali he ye congress sirf deal vaali he
 This is the real act of the Congress
 ye deal vaali baat modi nahin balki congress ke saansad virappa moili ne kahi he
 10
 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki congress party jhooth bolne main export he or kuch bhi jhooth bolti he
 He said that right now he played a lie that the Modi government is weakening the SC / ST law, but the truth is that the Modi government has strengthened this law
 unhone kaha ki congress ne baba sahib ambedkar kaa kai baar apmaan kiya he
 Read full speech here
 
 
 rahul ke PM vaale bayaan par modi kaa tanj - aise 'immature namdaar' ko janata sweekaaregi?gauratlab he ki karnataka main 12 may ko matdaan hona he
 The results will be declared on May 15 in the state

 The notorious serial killer Raman Raghav's horrific story: 1929 serial killer Raman Raghav created a sensation in Mumbai in the 60s by committing more than 40 murders
 yahaan tak kii usne apni bahan ke saath rape kiya tha
 The poor, sleeping on footpaths or living in slums in the northern suburbs of Mumbai city used to fall prey to Raghav
 raghav apane shikaar par raat main sote samay 'kisi baari or bhothere cheez se hamalaa karata tha, jisase unki maut ho jaati
 In 1968, Ramakant Kulkarni, the police officer of the Crime Branch, started investigating the Raman case
 tamaam prayaason ke baad ramakant kulkarni kii team 27 agast 1968 ko raman raghav ko pakadaney main kaamyaab ho gai
 Raman was considered a mysterious assassin, armed with some spiritual power
 yahaan tak kii use bharat kaa 'jaik da ripper' kaha gaya
 During that time, thousands of policemen were deployed for security, but the city was in panic
 shaam hote hi park or sadaken suuni ho jaati thimmumbai main saal 1965 se 1966 ke bich 19 logon par hamale hue
 After this, the chain of murders started again in 1968

 The only Don Ashwin Naik out of bars in Mayanagari Mumbai has been arrested by the Mumbai Crime Branch
 police ne aswin nike ko ek builder se jabaran paise vasuuli ke or dhamkaane ke maamle main giraftaar kiya he
 Ashwin is accused that Ashwin and his men were extorting money from a builder in Dadar area

 Not only this, it is alleged that by showing bullying, Ashwin acquired a stake in every project close to this builder
 shikaayat darj hone se pehle aswin ne is builder ko project se hatane ke liye jaan se maarane kii dhamkee di thi or jaan bakhshane ke liye dedh karod rupee kii maang kii thi
 After this the builder lodged a complaint with the Mumbai Crime Branch and Ashwin got into the grip
 mumbai main aswin nik akelaa anderworld don tha jo salaakhon se baahar tha
 Ashwin did not come to the senses of Naik even after he was sentenced for the murder of his wife Nita Naik by the Mumbai Crime Branch
 arun gavali kii giraftaar ke baad maidan saaf dekh aswin nik ne dakshin mumbai main apana samrajya failaana shuru kar diya tha
 Earlier on Wednesday, in a second case of extortion money, Ashwin was given advance bail by the sessions court of Mumbai
 aswin ko ab mumbai ke kila court main pesh kiya jayega
 The Mumbai Crime Branch claims that Ashwin would threaten them over the phone to spread his awe in the builders
 yahi nahin to maujuuda maamle main aswin kai baar is builder ke ghar jaakar bhi use dhamka chukaa he
 And now the police is looking for Ashwin's other associates in this case
 noida ke chif ejeeniyar yadav singh karpshan cese main elahabaad hai court kii lakhanu bainch ke sibiai jaanch ke aadesh ko supreme court main upi sarkaar ne chunauti di thi jise shuukravaar ko hui sunwaayee main supreme court ne khaarij kar diya he
 The court asked the UP government why the UP government is so interested in this matter
 yadav singh ko court main aane den agar unhen yah lagata he ki is cese ko sibiai ko nahin saunpa janaa chahie
 The UP government had filed a special permission petition stating that the letter written by the Union Ministry of Finance on February 24 proves that the Center wants to take political advantage of it by forcibly conducting a CBI inquiry into the matter
 upi sarkaar kii taraf se daayar yachika main kaha gaya tha ki hai-court ke saamne yachikakarta nutan thakur ne nyaayik jaanch kii maang kii thi jiske liye avkashprapt jaj e en verma kii adhyakshata main hai level nyaayik ayog kaa gathan kar diya gaya tha
 Nevertheless, the High Court handed over the investigation to the CBI based on the Central Government letter
 upi sarkaar ne hai court ke aadesh par roak lagane kii guhaar kii he
 The comments upi sarkaar kii taraf se daakhil kii gayi yachika main kaha gaya tha ki jis vakt hai court main sunwaayee chal hi rahi thi usee vakt kendra sarkaar ke vitt mantralay ke doirector ne patr likhakar jaanch kii sanstuti kii thi
 The UP government has expressed surprise that the letter written by the director reached the petitioner Nutan Thakur
 upi sarkaar ne daawa karte hue kaha ki sibiai jaanch keval un maamalon main kii ja sakati he jis maamle main rajya ke baahar jaanch kii zarurat he yaa is tarah ke tathy saamne aaye jo bahut hi takneekee pahaluon ke hon
 However, such allegations are not forthcoming in the allegations against Yadav Singh
 yachika main kaledhan kii jaanch ke liye banaai gayi vishesh jaanch team (esaiti) ke hastkshep ko bhi galat qaraar diya gaya tha
 It was argued in the petition that since Yadav Singh is the only accused in this case of corruption, there is no role of SIT in this case
 court ne upi sarkaar se kaha ki upi sarkaar ko is maamle main itani ruchi kyon he
 Let Yadav Singh come to court if he feels that the case should not be handed over to the CBI
 upi sarkaar ne vishesh anumati yachika daakhil kar kaha tha ki kendra sarkaar ke vittamantralay dwaara 24 farvari ko likhe gayi patr se saaf sabit hota he ki kendra is maamle main jabardastee sibiai jaanch karwaakar iskaa rajnatik phayda lenaa chaahati he
 The petition filed by the UP government said that petitioner Nutan Thakur had demanded a judicial inquiry before the High Court for which a High Level Judicial Commission headed by retired Judge AN Verma was constituted
 phir bhi hai court ne kendra sarkaar ke patr ke aadhaar par jaanch sibiai ko saunp di
 The UP government has requested a stay on the High Court order
 tippaniyan In the petition filed by the UP government, it was said that while the hearing was going on in the High Court, at the same time, the Director of the Finance Ministry of the Central Government had written a letter and recommended the investigation
 upi sarkaar ne aashcharya vyakt karte hue kaha he ki doirector dwaara likhaa gaya patr yachikakarta nutan thakur ke paas kaise pahunch gaya
 The UP government claimed that CBI investigation can be done only in those cases which need to be investigated outside the state or such facts come out which are of very technical aspects
 lekin, yadav singh ke khilaaf lage aaropon main is tarah kii baaten saamne nahin aa rahi
 In the petition, the intervention of the Special Investigation Team (SIT) created to investigate black money was also termed as wrong
 yachika main tark kiya gaya tha ki chunki bhrashtachar ke is maamle main yadav singh keval ek hi aaropee he isliye is maamle main esaiti kaa koi role nahin banataa

 The ICC gave Kotla a life of hosting but also placed a condition that a fresh pitch for the World Cup would be prepared and no match would be played until the World Cup started

 Let me tell you that for the last two decades, Walmart was facing constant challenges in Europe
 america main diggaj company hone ke baavjood europe ke international oparation main walmart kii entry aasaan nahin rahi
 In 1999, Walmart stepped in with an investment in retail company ASDA in England, but Walmart's strategy seems to be changing with the changing times
 pichley kuch saalon main walmart ne bahut kam store khole hai, lekin internet bijness par bahut zyada focus kiya he
 Currently, more and more people are shopping online and e-commerce companies like Amazon are leading them
 company kaa focus abhi america main order ke din hi delivery par he, jabaki uskaa mukhya focus china or bharat jaise deshon par he
 Under this, Walmart bought a 77 percent stake in Flipkart

 It cannot be denied that the market also has a big hand in bringing good days of economy
 yahi vajah he ki share bazaar main jari uthapatak is sarkaar ke liye behatar bhavishyavaanee nahin sabit ho rahi he
 Even if the government keeps on dreaming of good days, the impact of weak and unstable market will definitely be seen on the country's economy

 Because of this, instead of investing in real estate and gold, the middle class has now started investing in the market

 In particular, investment from small cities is continuously increasing
 yahi vajah he ki mutual fund industry kaa nivesh 2017 main 22 lakh karod ko paar kar gaya he, jisamen 1
 69 lakh crore has come in this year
 fund managersko dar he ki agar share bazaar main yun hi giravat kaa daur bana rahaa, to isse mutual fund industry kaa nivesh 50 fisadi tak neeche aa saktaa he
 Domestic investors who are just now coming forward to invest in them can start pulling their hands

 When you try to develop new jobs and industries in your provinces, you have to compete not only with each other, but also from other countries like India, China and Brazil

 Rhodes believes that during his time there were no number-2 and number-3 fielders as well, so he remained number-1
 iske saath hi unhone england ke bharat daure ko lekar kaha ki use yahaan sangharsh karnaa padegaa
 Rhodes, who came to the inauguration of the talent hunt program of the Indian Junior Players League (IJPL) on Friday, told reporters that the cricket of his time and the cricket of the present has changed
 aaj kaa cricket pehle se behatar he
 Rhodes said, "I was the only fielder in my time

 When asked if you think today's bowling level has dropped below your time, Rhodes laughed and said, "we were a better player
" " "in the first ODI cricket, only yorker ball was seen, slow ball and bouncer trend was also not in my time in limited overs cricket but in today's round you will also see slow bouncer

 number-2 or number-3 fielder bhi nahin the, lekin aaj ke daur main kai yuva khilaadi shandaar fielding kar rahe hai
 So the level of the game has improved already
 " Talking about the change in bowling, this veteran said that in today's cricket there is a lot of variation in bowling
 rods se jab poocha gaya ki kya aapako lagata he ki aaj kii gendbaaji kaa str aapke samay se neeche gira he to unhone hansate hue kaha, "ham zyada behatar khilaadi the

 The level of the game has already improved and i believe T20 cricket has done it

 Rhodes said, "it will be a difficult series for England
 agar yah teen test maichon kii siries hoti or aap pehla match haar jate to beshak mushkil hoti
 Being in India for a five-match series is a tough challenge both physically and mentally

 And they also say that when wealth comes quickly and uncountably, it also brings death many times with trouble
 dilli main bahut se nae bane raison ke saath haal ke vakt main jo kuch hua he use dekh kar sachmuch ye baaten sach lagane lagi hai
 Be it Ponty Chadha, who tastes outside the liquor store, or Arun Gupta, one of Delhi's biggest traders in electronics
 yaa phir sabase taaja arbapati builder deepak bharadwaj
 All these nobles have the same story
 beshumaar daulat kamai, magar ghar ke rishton ko hi sambhaal nahin paae
 Rather, due to the same wealth, their relationships became enemies of their lives
 daulat kii khatir ponti chaddha or uske bhai hardip chaddha ne ek-duusare ko hi goli maar di
 Arun Gupta's betel nut was given to him by his brother-in-law
 or ab deepak bharadwaj ke naam kii supaari nikali to vah bhi apane hi ghar ke andar se
 Son Nitesh got the father killed
 yah sach he ki deepak bharadwaj ke apni bivi or donon beton se rishte thik nahin the
 For the last 10 years, they were living separately from their families
 bivi-beton ko kharch bhi nahin dete the
 According to Delhi Police sources, Deepak used to meet his wife and sons often till a year ago, despite the relationship deteriorating
 ve log farm house main bhi aate rahete the
 But last year, Bhardwaj got a clue that Nitesh is growing pangs of friendship with his Mehbooba
 or bas yaheen se bharadwaj bhadak gaye
 He prohibited Nitesh from entering the farm house
 or isi baat ne bete ko apane hi baap kaa sabase bada dushman bana diya
 And then a son made that decision, thinking about which someone's soul would tremble
 yah faisla tha deepak bharadwaj ke katl kaa
 Nitesh spoke to his family friend and lawyer Baljit Singh Sehrawat about this
 saharaavat chunaav laduya chahta tha or use paison kii jarurat thi
 He fueled Nitesh's intentions and asked him to sponsor the election
 lekin baad main usne apana iraadaa badal liya or nitesh se uske pita ke katl ke liye puure paanch karod ru
 demanded
 apane pita se buree tarah ub chuke nitesh ne isaki hami bhar di
 Now Sehrawat began to set his mind and spoke to a Mahant of Haridwar whose armament was great
 yah tha mahant pratibhanand
 He wanted to open a big shop of spirituality in the form of a big ashram and for this he had to devise every way to earn money
 saharaavat ne use is ‘bade kaam’ kaa ofer diya or vah raji ho gaya
 So far Sehrawat has received Rs 50 lakh in advance
 mil chuke the
 Of this, he spent around three and a half lakh rupees
 mahant ko thamaaye
 He showed his driver and old disciple Purshottam alias Monu the sabbabag of changing his fortune and he paid Rs 2 lakh
 lekar bharadwaj ko thikaane lagane nikal padaa
 He tried to target her twice outside Bhardwaj's farm house in Delhi, but he escaped for different reasons
 purushottam ne 26 march kii subah apane ek saathi sunil urf sonu or amit ko is kaam ke liye chand hajaar rupayon main raji kiya or donon ne bharadwaj ke farm house main ghuskar uskaa kaam tamaam kar diya
 But CCTV cameras destroyed his secret
 ab sajeesh ke benakaab hone kii baari thi
 But since Purushottam did not know anyone ahead of the Mahant, the investigation was not going ahead
 aakhirkaar police ne jab shaq ke ghere main aae bharadwaj ke gharavaalon se poochtacha karne ke saath unke mobile phone kii jaanch shuru kii or chote bete nitesh ne ain vaardaat ke din apana ek mobile phone tut jane kii baat kahi to police kaa maathaa thanka
 On proceeding to Taftish, it was found that Nitesh had a number that no one knew about
 jab police ne is number kii scanning kii to uski or saharaavat kii lambii baatcheet kaa khulaasa hua or phir donon ke cross interogeshan se sara maamla khul gaya
 Deepak Bhardwaj had good relations with his wife and both sons till 25 years after their marriage
 yahaan tak ki deepak ne nitesh ko beatech kii padhai ke liye america bheja
 Deepak also took all his expenses of living in Canada for four years
 yahaan tak ki shahrukh khan kii patni gauri khan kii kagin se bete kii shaadi bhi baap ne hi badi dhoomdhaam se karai thi
 But about 10 years ago, Bharadwaj's thinking changed after the arrival of wealth
 dilli se sate haryana ke sonipat jile ke ek chote-se gaanv kaa rahane vaala bharadwaj pehle cells tex department main stenographer tha
 But his desires were high from the beginning
 usne 1979 main apni naukari chhodkar dilli main automobile patrs kaa kaarobaar shuru kiya or phir kuch arase baad dukaan kaa shater giraakar property ke kaam main lag gaya
 Bhardwaj started land deals in places like Noida, Faridabad and Gurgaon besides Delhi
 iske baad usne kai vivaadit jameen ke tukdon kaa sauda kiya
 Now most of Bharadwaj's time was spent in getting up and sitting with big men and leaders and having fun with girls
 haai socity main uthanaa-baithna, nai-nai mahilaon se milanaa uskaa shagal banane laga or phir dekhte-hi-dekhte parivaar kahin peeche chhutata chalaa gaya
 When the wife and children came to know about this new pastime of Deepak, a quarrel started in the house
 teen saal pehle deepak kii mulaakaat kanpur kii ek ladki se hui, jo dilli main rahati thi
 Deepak made him in charge of the parties and ceremonies at his farm house resort and marriage hall
 bharadwaj or vah ladki ek-duusare ke behad kareeb aa gaye
 Although she was about 35 years younger than Bhardwaj at the age
 us dauraan nitesh kaa bhi apane pita ke farm house main lagaataar aana-janaa rahata tha
 After some meetings, Nitesh also became friends with that girl
 iske baad rishte itane bade ki deepak kii mahabuuba uske bijness ke bare main nitesh ko report dene lagi
 He used to gather information about his father's business and wealth through him
 magar donon kii dosti zyada din tak chuphi nahin rah saki
 Deepak became aware of the relationship between his son Nitesh and the girl
 usne ek roj nitesh ko jaleel kar usne farm house se nikaal diya or saath hi yah dhamkee di ki vah uski maa ko talaak dekar us ladki se shaadi karegaa or maa-beton ko apni jaaydaad main se ek phooti kaudi nahin degaa
 According to police sources, just after this, Nitesh decided to remove his father from the road so that he would not get a chance to get a second marriage
 use dar tha ki use sachmuch property main koi hissaa nahin milegaa
 In the statement that Nitesh gave to the police after his arrest, he said, "my father was capable of this death
 usne kabhi hamen apana betaa nahin samajha
 Even an enemy does not do what my father did to us
 vah lakhon rupye gairon par uda detaa, par ham logon ko ek-ek paise ke liye tarasaata tha
 Even we were not allowed to go to his farm house
 usne meri maa, mere bade bhai or mere saath hameshaa bura suluk kiya
 He used to insult us in front of women and girls
 dost, padosi, rishtedaar ham logon kaa majaak udaate the ki dekho, arbapati ke bete kis haal main rah rahe hai? uske liye aisi hi maut thik thi
 i do not regret what i did
 ”masalaa sirf nafrat kaa nahin, balki us daulat kaa he jise paane ke liye bete ne nafrat kaa mukhauta pahan kar apane laalchee chehre ko chupaane kii koshish kii
 Wealth can make anyone blind
 itnaa andhaa ki phir use koi rishta najar nahin aata
 This is also a truth behind the high doors of big rooms in metros
 kehete hai ki rulaane se kahin zyada mushkil hota he,hansaana
 But Bollywood comedian (comedian) Johnny Walker not only tickled crores of cinematographers with his witty gestures, but also took away all his fatigue with his 'champi' (song)
 johny walker ne apane chehre ke haav-bhav kii badaulat hi 'jane kahaan meraa jigar gaya ji' (mistar and misses 55), 'sir jo tera chakraae yaa dil duba jaae' (pyaasa) or 'i dil he mushkil jeena yahaan' jaise gaanon ko sadaa ke liye amar kar diya
 He had the ability to draw everyone towards him with his innocent, but mischievous face
 aaie jaanate hai is mahaan kalakaar kii jindagi se judi kuch khaas baat:1
 Born in 1925 in Indore, Walker's real name was Badruddin Jamaluddin Kazi
 film jagat main aane se pehle vah ek bas conductor the
 2 His father was a laborer in a textile mill in Srinagar
 kapadaa mil band hui to puraa parivaar mumbai aa gaya
 The father was finding it difficult to maintain his 15-member family
 pita ke kandhon se bhaar kuch kam karne ke liye badaruddin bombai electric supplai and transport (best) bason main ek conductor kii naukari karne sahit vibhinn vyavsaayon main haath aajamaane kii koshish karte rahe
 3
 27 kii umr main vah dadar bas depo main mukhya rup se tainaat rahe
 Apart from cutting the ticket of passengers in the Badruddin bus, they used to keep entertaining the passengers by telling strange stories and stories
 iske peeche unka makasad yahi thi ki koi unki gupt adaakaari ko pahchaan le
 His wish was also fulfilled
 gurudutt kii film 'baaji' ke liye patakatha likhane vaale abhinayta balraj saahani kii najar ek bas safar ke dauraan badaruddin par padi
 4
 saahani ne badaruddin ko guru dutt ke saath apni kismat aajamaane kaa suzav diya
 It is said that Badruddin, who arrived to meet Dutt on the set, was asked to act for an alcoholic, seeing that Gurudutt was so impressed that he immediately signed Badruddin to 'baji' (1951)
