 unka kahana he ki agar marji ke khilaaf shaadi karne par pita apane bacchon ko sampatti se bedakhal karte hai, to ve court kaa darwaja khatkhata sakate hai
 He said that the property has been divided into two categories under the Hindu Succession Act
 pehla wo sampatti jo khud arjeet kii gai he or duusari wo sampatti jo pita ko apane purvajon se viraasat main mili he yani paitruk sampatti
 Advocate Upendra Mishra says that on the ancestral property, like a son, the daughter also has full rights
 pita ko apni paitruk sampatti main beti or betaa donon ko baraabar hissaa dena hoga
 He says that Sakshi will get all the rights that a Hindu girl gets

 unka kahana he ki sakshi ko apane pita rajesh mishra kii paitruk sampatti par puraa hissaa milegaa
 Although the father may wish to evict his children from his own property, he cannot take away his right from the ancestral property

 In the Lok Sabha elections (lok Sabha Elections 2019), even though the Congress (congress) has had to face the nation, its performance in Kerala was good and the party won 15 seats here
 yahaan se jeetne waalon main congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi (rahul Gandhi) bhi hai jinhone yahaan kii vynad seat se jeet hasil kii
 But a leader of Congress in the state has found it overwhelming to praise Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 party ne unhen tatkaal prabhaav se nashkisit kar diya he
 Kerala Congress leader AP Abdullakutty, who praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the nda's stunning victory, was fired by the party with immediate effect on Monday
 abdullakutti ne kuch din pehle fasebuk post main likhaa tha ki endie kii jeet modi ke vikaas ke agenda kii sweekaaryata dikhaati he or unki safalataa kaa raaj he ki unhone gandhivadi mulyon ko apanaaya
 Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee President Mullappally Ramachandran said that the Congress Party sought clarification from Abdullakutty on praising Modi to which he responded in a derisive manner
 congress kii kerala ikai ne ek bayaan main kaha ki abdullakutti ne party ke hiton or uske kaaryakartaaon kii bhaawanaaon ke viruddh bayaan dekar party ke khilaaf kaam kiya he
 It said that he was making derogatory statements against senior Congress leaders and breaking party discipline through the media
 ramchandran ne kaha, ‘‘in halaat main abdullakutti ko tatkaal prabhaav se party se nishkasit kar diya gaya he
 Abdullakutty, a two-time CPI (M) MP, was also expelled from the Left party in 2009 for praising Modi as the Chief Minister of Gujarat
 baad main vah congress se vidhayak bane
 While he praised Modi this time, he also praised schemes like Swachh Bharat Mission and Ujjwala launched during his reign
 congress ke mukhpatr ‘veekshanam' main abdullakutti kii ninda karte hue unhen ‘pravasi pakshi' qaraar diya gaya or kaha gaya he ki unka bartaav puri tarah asweekaarya he
 Abdullakutty dismissed the allegations, saying the newspaper had reacted without knowing his side

 The Law Minister said that many people are accusing him of coal allocation, but he has failed to praise that if higher prices are charged for coal, the prices of many other products will also go up
 khurshid ne kaha, ‘jo galat hua vah yah he ki kisi ko koyala iske liye koi keemat liye bina diya gaya he
 We will charge a higher price than that person
 kya aap chaahate hai ki aap apane ghar ke liye istemaal hone vaale steel yaa bijli ke liye yaa apana ghar banane ke liye cement ke adhik daam pradaan karen
 'he said,' What you need in India is communication skills and people who can tell a good story

 Underworld don Abu Salem has been sentenced to two life imprisonment by a Mumbai special TADA court
 jabaki pratyrpan kii shart ke mutabik use 25 saal se zyada kii sajaa nahi di ja sakati he
 People close to Salem have spoken against this decision of the TADA court in the Supreme Court
 mumbai kii vishesh tada court ke jaj jie saanap ne buudhvaar dopaher ko sajaa sunaate hue kaha ki abu salem ko builder pradeep jain kii hatya kii sajeesh rachane or use anjaam dene ke liye tada kii dhara 3(2) (1) or bhadvi kii dhara 120 bi donon dhaaraon ke tahat sashram umrakaid kii sajaa or 2-2 lakh rupee jurmaana kii sajaa di jaati he
 The judge also sentenced him to 25 years in 4 other sections
 vishesh sarkari vakil ujjwal nikam ne adaalat ke faisle par prasannataa jaahir kii he
 But it also said that the death penalty would have been more appropriate for the kind of crime that Salem has committed
 par hamen pataa he ki portugal se pratyrpit karte samay use sharton ke saath laayaa gaya tha
 The judiciary has done its work, now it is up to the executive to take a stand on the matter
 haalanki apane bade bhai ke hatyare ko sajaa dilaane ke liye 20 saal se sangharsh kar rahe sunil jain umrakaid se santusht nahin he
 He says that our entire family wants him to get the death penalty because if it is left out like this, then the other gangsters will be encouraged to do anything sitting outside and do not get the death penalty in India
 builder pradeep jain kii hatya march 1995 main kii gai thi or salem ko 11 november 2005 ko bharat laayaa gaya tha
 By then, two shooters had been sentenced to life imprisonment and some had escaped
 baavjood iske jaanch agency aties ne salem se poochtacha ke baad puri sajeesh main shaamil chaar or aropiyon menhadi hasan, wike jhaam, naeem khan or riyaj siddiki ko benakaab kiya
 The then ATS chief KP Raghuvanshi told NDTV that there was no doubt that ATS officials had put up a strong case by linking every episode of the conspiracy
 lekin usase bhi ahm he ki pradeep jain ke parivaar ke sadasyon or baaki chashmadidon kii gavaahi
 The TADA court has also sentenced another convict Mehdi Hasan to life imprisonment, while the rest of the sentence was waived in view of VK Jham's age and illness
 jaankaar bataa rahe hai aisa pehali baar hua he jab desh ke baahar baithkar vaardaaton ko anjaam dene vaala koi bada anderworld don hindustan laae jane ke baad doshi sabit hua he or use sajaa bhi mili he
 It is clear that sitting outside the country, there is a lesson for the other don and underworld mafia who have committed crime in India, that they should not be under the illusion that they are above the law

'' is par sadan taaliyon se gunjane laga or logon ne kaha ki wo vakt aa gaya aa gaya
 She said that this time could have come even in the time of Indira Gandhi, because she was a woman
 unke paas bahumat bhi tha, lekin unke samay sirf ek sanghathan bana, jiskaa naam he- ol india muslim personal lau
 05:29 PM: Minister of State for External Affairs MJ Akbar narrates the story of journalist Taya Jinking
 unhone bataaya ki taaya jinking ek patrkaar thim or unke shuhar moharis jinking british raaj ke aakhri vitt sachiv the

" ''04:06 PM: minakshine kaha ki 1986 kaa kanoon mahila ko milane vaale bhatte ke khilaaf tha
 Today, those who are opposing this bill are speaking the language of the Muslim Personal Law Board
 congress ne jo kanoon pesh kiya tha, usamen teen talaak ke khilaaf koi niyam nahin tha
 Today i dedicate the day to those who resigned in the name of Shahbano
 30 saal baad desh main bahumat kii sarkaar he, isliye mauka he is faisle ko liya jaae
 He said that any decision given by the Supreme Court is the same as a law
 03:57 pm:bahes main bijepi kii ore seminakshi lekhine kaha ki 22 islamic deshon main teen talaak par bain he, lekin hamaara desh secular he phir bhi yahaan nahin ho paaya he
 Because it is not being stopped due to politics in our country
 unhone kaha ki shariya kya he aajkal is mudde par koi bahes nahin hui
 Nothing has been written about it after three divorces
 talaak-e-biddat kaa mazahab se koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 This House also enacted a law to stop the practice of sati, there was a provision for capital punishment in it
 minakshi lekhibolin ki jo mullah-maulavee teen talaak main hastkshep karte hai, unke khilaaf bhi kanoon hona chahie
 They mislead the society, Parliament should also enact a law against them
 1955-56 se pehle hindu dharm main bhi kanoonee rup se talaak nahin le sakate the
 But the change was made later, so why can't this change happen? minakshi ne kaha ki desh main mahilaayein kaaphi alpsankhyak hai

 This is the purpose of the bill
 03:42 pm:bahes mensushmita devne kaha ki do guton main dushmani badhanaa, danga karwaanaa, in maamalon main teen saal kii jail hoti he
 But even getting divorced is getting jail for three years, is it right? bill main is baat par koi praavdhaan nahin he ki mahila ko kis tarah paisa diya jayega, kitna hissaa diya jayega or uskaa process kya hoga
 If the government talks about the empowerment of women, would the government want to pass the Women's Reservation Bill
 sarkaar maritial rape ko lekar kanoon banane par raji nahin he, lekin is bill ko mahila shashaktikaran ke liye bataa rahe hai
 03:36 PM: Sushmita Devane said that we are not opposing this bill, the loopholes that are there should be rectified
 uske liye ise standing cameti main bhejnaa jaruri he
 He said that after divorcing, when the husband goes to jail, and he will not even get bail
 to kya wo patni ko bhatta dene par raji kaise hoga
 If my husband says in court that i did not intend to divorce, i was just angry
 to mahila kis tarah pruf karegi ki jo talaak hua he, vah sachcha he
 03:31 PM: Sushmita Devane participated in the debate on behalf of the Congress
 unhone kaha ki jab supreme court kaa faisla aayaa tha, tab congress ne faisle kaa khule taur par swaagat kiya tha
 He said that this bill is very small, there are some shortcomings in the bill
 ye ek aitihaasik bill he, ham iske saath hai lekin jo kamiyaan hai unhen dur kiya jaae
 Divorce will be a crime based on this bill, but it is a civil matter
 03:27 pm:congress kii apil pararavishankarne kaha ki ye kanoon desh ke hit main he, vipaksh jo bhi salaah degaa ham use lagu karne kii koshish karenge
 03:24 PM: Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge said that there are some shortcomings in this bill, you have not consulted any group in this bill
 kabhi-kabhi ham sochate hai ki ham hi sahi hai, lekin har baar aisa nahin hota
 The loopholes in the bill can be overcome by sitting together
 ise ham standing cameti main bhej sakate hai, jahaan sabhi partiyaan milakar is par bahes kar sakate hai
 The opinion of the government on this issue is the same as the opposition
 ham ise taalna nahin chaahate hai, lekin aam sahamit jaruri he
 Therefore, this bill should be sent to the Standing Committee
 03:17 PM: ravishankarbole ki hamane kaaphi chota bill banaaya he, agar aap kahenge to jail jaaenge
 You must pay alimony for your wife
 ye sadan kanoon banaati he, loksabhaa hindustan kii sabase badi panchayat he
 The bill should not be seen from the bars of politics, the bill should not be tied in the walls of the parties, the bill should not be weighed on the scales of religion, nor be tested from the account of vote bank
 ye bill muslim bahanon kii garima kaa bill he

 AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi opposed the bill

 Owaisi said that divorce is illegal, law on domestic violence is already in place, then what is the need for another similar law? The Muslim Personal Law Board disliked the government bill The opponent is told
 beete ravivaar ko lakhanu main is sambandh main personal lau board kii varking cameti kii baithak hui
 The proposed bill on triple talaq was discussed in this meeting
 kai ghanton chali baithak ke baad board ne is bill ko khaarij karne kaa nirnay liya
 Not only this, the bill being brought on triple divorce has been declared by the board as anti-women
 saath hi teen saal kii sajaa dene vaale prastaavit masaude ko criminal act qaraar diya he
 In the board meeting, the law on triple talaq has been said to interfere with the independence of women
 kaisaa hoga bill?gauratlab he ki sarkaar ‘da muslim vimen protection of ritis in marij act’ naam se is vidheyak ko laa rahi he
 This law will only apply to three divorces (INSTANT TALAQ, ie divorce-e-biddat)
 is kanoon ke baad koi bhi muslim pati agar patni ko teen talaak degaa to wo gaiyr-kanoonee hoga
 Henceforth, three divorces granted in any form, whether oral or written or in a message, would be invalid
 jo bhi teen talaak degaa, usko teen saal kii sajaa or jurmaana ho saktaa he
 That is, giving triple talaq would be a non-bailable and cognizable offense
 isamen magistrate tay karegaa ki kitna jurmaana hoga
 PM Narendra Modi had formed a group of ministers to legislate on triple talaq, which included Rajnath Singh, Arun Jaitley, Sushma Swaraj, Ravi Shankar Prasad, PP Chaudhary and Jitendra Singh
 aisa he prastaavit bill- ek saath teen baar talaak (bolkar, likhakar yaa email, esemes or whatsap jaise electronic madhyam se) kahana gaiyrkanoonee hog- aisa karne vaale pati ko teen saal ke karawas kii sajaa ho sakati he
 This would be considered a non-bailable and cognizable offense
 - yah kanoon sirf 'talaak e biddat' yani ek saath teen baar talaak bolne par lagu hoga
 - The victim of divorce can appeal to the Magistrate seeking alimony for himself and minor children
 - peedit mahila magistrate se naaballig bacchon ke sangrakshan kaa bhi anurodh kar sakati he
 The magistrate will take a final decision on the issue
 - yah prastaavit kanoon jammu-kashmir ko chhodkar puure desh main lagu hoga he

 Books which are not found in shops and library, can be easily purchased at the book fair
 ''85 varshiya varisht sahityakar shriranjan suryadev kehete hai ki bihar gyaan or vigyaan kaa pramukh centre rahaa he, jise pustak melon se nai jaan mili he
 This fair has not only aroused cultural consciousness but it has proved to be helpful in establishing a new identity of the state
 purv kendriya rajyamantri or patna uniwarsity ke professor dow
 Sanjay Paswan also has a similar thinking
 ve kehete hai, ''chhath or patna pustak mela do aise maukey hai, jab aparaadh kaa graph shunya par hota he
 "it is not that the acceptance of the book fair is limited to the authors only
 yah saanskrithik centre ke rup main bhi viksit hua he or chaatro, shikshakon or buddhijiviyon ke liye ahm manch ban gaya he
 Abhishek Nayan, a student at the National Institute of Technology (NIT), says, "the book fair is a powerful medium to expand the scope of knowledge as only books of course are available in shops, but books of many publishers are available at the fair
 ''shaayad yahi vajah he ki chaatr is meley kaa intjaar karte hai
 Khushi Sharma from Patna, who is preparing for banking, says that many level books are available for the competition exam, that too at discounted rates
 bacchon, mahilaon or sudhi pathakon ko bhi meley kaa intjaar rahata he
 Often students play an important role in the purchase of books
 lekin meley main vikalpon ke bich abhibhavakon ke saath chayan karne kii aazaadee hoti he
 Fair also comes as a hope for publishers
 samyak prakaashan ke shanti swaroop buddha kehete hai, ''meley main bihar ke pathakon kaa pustakon se lagaav dekhne ko miltaa he

 Dr
 of this institute piyush kumaar ne bataaya ki pustak mela aamadani hi nahin, unke publication ke liye lab kaa kaam karata rahaa he
 This gives new experiences, which are best done in the next fair
 unhone bataaya, ''ek baar is kitaab ke meley main ek chote bachche ne oinstin kii kitaab maangi thi, lekin uplabdh na hone par uski tippanee thi ki jab aisi kitaab nahi rakhenge to log kharidenge kya? us tippanee ke baad 20 bade vaigyanikon ke jivan par aadhaarit kitaaben prakashit kii gai hai
 "it is the result of the growing aspirations and enthusiasm of such people that the size of this fair, which is being held in a radius of hardly 20-25,000 sq ft, has increased to nearly two lakh sq ft in 2013

 The organizer of the fair organizing committee Amit Jha said that the craze of the book has got a bigger size through electronic means
 nai technology nai peedi main padhgaye kii lalak paidaa kar rahi he, jinaki bhukh aakhirkaar pustakon se hi puri ho rahi he
 The appetite of the readers can be gauged from the fact that in September 1985, the National Book Trust (NBT) had announced to organize a book fair in Patna, but it was canceled due to some reasons
 lekin pustak premiyon ke dabaav ke aage jhukate hue use aktubar main pustak mela yojit karnaa padaa tha

 america raashtrapati donald trump pheradal beuro of investigeshan (FBI) chif james komi ko hataakar buree tarah funs gaye hai
 Now a motion of impeachment can be brought against him in Congress
 haalanki donon sadanon main republican kaa varchasv he
 Disputes have erupted across the world, including in the US, following the removal of James Komi, who is investigating Russian interference in the US presidential election
 is masale ko lekar america raashtrapati trump apane desh main hi virodh kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 In fact, in the 2016 US presidential election, Russia was hacking and Trump won the election
 purv FBI chif komi ke kareebi sutron kaa kahana he ki rus masale ko lekar trump buree tarah funsate najar aa rahe the, jiske chalate unhone is kadam ko uthaaya he
 Komi had expedited the investigation into the case and did not take Trump into confidence
 isse trump ne khud ke liye khatra maanate hue yah kadam uthaaya
 Trump took this fatal step just a day before Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov's US visit
 is ghatnakram ke baad america raajnneeti main bhuuchaal aa gaya he
 At the same time, the e-mail dispute kept silence in the Clinton case
 haal hi main ek intervyuu main unhone kaha tha ki komi ke chalate unako chunaav main haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 In such a situation, she refrains from making any kind of statement
 iske alaava unhone democratin party ne dabi jubaan main trump kaa virodh kiya he
 US President gives clarification: US President Trump has given clarification regarding the removal of Komi
 unhone kaha ki vah apane kaam ko thik se kar nahin rahe the, jiske chalate unako hataaya gaya he, lekin unki yah baat kisi ke gale nahin utar rahi he
 In such a situation, a motion of impeachment can be brought in Congress against US President Trump
 haalanki congress main trump kii republican party kaa bahumat he, jiske chalate unke satta se baahar hone kii ummid kam hi he
 Trump has also removed two more judicial officers appointed by former US President Barack Obama
 1973 main america raashtrapati ko kiya gaya tha barkhaast1973 main tatkaaleen raashtrapati richard nicksan ne pani ghotaale yani waterget kii nishpaksh jaanch kar rahe archibald cokes ko hataa diya tha, jiske baad unke khilaaf congress main mahabhiyog kaa prastaav laayaa gaya tha
 Due to this, he had to resign from his post
 trump kii tarah nicksan voterget main buree tarah funs gaye the
 Trump has not been held for even a year and has been involved in many controversies
 mana ja rahaa he ki yah trump kaa ab tak kaa sabase ghaatak kadam he
 The American people say Trump has abused the position by removing Komi
 vah khud ko kanoon se upar samajhane lage hai
 Apart from this, the popularity of trumps has also declined significantly

 ) With the formation of the 17th Lok Sabha, the country is going to get a new speaker in the form of Om Birla and today he is likely to be elected unopposed on Wednesday
 kota sansadeey seat se bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ke saansad om birla spikar banane vaale rajasthan ke pehle rajaneta hai
 There was also a speaker in parliamentary history who was incensed with Indira Gandhi and in turn defeated her in the presidential election
 vaise to spikar kii khaas bhoomika loksabhaa satr ke dauraan sadan ko sucharu rup se chalaane kii hoti he, lekin kai spikar aise hue hai jin par satta paksh kaa saath dene ke aarope lage to kai ne apane kartavyon kaa paalan kiya
 The role of the speakers was disputed in many ways, many of them joined the category of speakers due to their different style, tough and controversial decisions
 pehla spikar congress se1952 main pehali loksabhaa ke gathan ke baad congress ke netaa or swatantraaa senaanee ganesh vasudev maavlankar desh ke pehle spikar bane or unka chunaav nirvirodh hua
 After the death of Mavalankar in 1956, the election of Ananthasayanam Iyengar of the Congress in his place for the remaining term was also uncontested
 unka kaarykaal saamaanya rahaa, lekin vah desh ke pehle spikar ke rup main hameshaa yaad kiye jaaenge
 a Speaker who became President Neelam Sanjiva Reddy became the fourth Lok Sabha Speaker of the country in 1967
 spikar banane ke saath hi unhone congress party se istipha de diya or sakriy raajnneeti se sanyas le liya
 He used to call himself the Watchman of Parliament, but his term as speaker was not normal
 pradhanmantri indira gandhi ke saath sadan main unki kai maukon par tikhi bahes hui
 Neelam Sanjiva Reddy had to bear the brunt of this in the presidential election in 1969 when he stepped down as speaker to contest the election
 1967 main aam chunaav ke dauraan parinaam dekhti indira gandhicongress ne neelam sanjeev reddy ko raashtrapati pad kaa ummidavaar ghoshit kiya, lekin indira gandhi ne unka virodh kiya
 Indira Gandhi felt that if Reddy won the election, he could be removed from the post of Prime Minister
 haalanki party ke baari dabaav ke kaaran unhen reddy ko ummidavaar ke rup main sweekaar karnaa padaa, lekin unhone apni party ke nirvaachit pratinidhiyon ko party line par jane kii bajaae apni antarratma kii aawaaj sunne kii apil kii
 The result was that Neelam Sanjeeva Reddy lost the election and Independent candidate VV Giri became the President
 yahi wo shuruaati daur rahaa jahaan se indira gandhi kii sthiti majboot hoti chali gai or wo party se upar hoti chali gayi
 Shortest speaker Neenilam Sanjeeva Reddy returned to active politics shortly after losing the presidential election and was elected unopposed as the sixth speaker on 26 March 1977 for the second time
 haalanki isi saal july main raashtrapati pad ke chunaav ke liye unhone spikar ke pad se istipha de diya or nirvirodh raashtrapati chun liye gaye
 Reddy was the second time as a speaker for only 3 months and 17 days and his record of being the shortest speaker is also in his name
 pehle kaarykaal ke dauraan bhi vah 2 saal or 124 din hi spikar rahe or raashtrapati banane ke liye pad choda tha
 Speaker Ram Balak Jakhar, who had a 17-hour debate on Bofors, was the speaker of two Lok Sabha in a row from 1980 to 1989 and he became the first speaker of the country to be a speaker for nearly 10 years
 1980 se 1984 tak bataur spikar unka pehla kaarykaal shant rahaa, jabaki 1984 se 1989 tak kaa doosraa kaarykaal zyada charchit rahaa
 There were many meaningful debates during his tenure, including the debate on the Bofors case
 rajeev gandhi ke daur ke is behad charchit maamle par spikar jakhad ne sadan main 17 ghante se zyada samay tak bahes karwaai
 Also, it was during the tenure of Balram Jakhar that the process of computerization of the functioning of the Lok Sabha was started
 1984 main gathit aathvin loksabhaa ke har satr main jakhad par pakshpaat ke aarope lagate rahe
 Speaker Sam Sangma's tenure was a very challenging one, because he had a mixed government at the center
 1996 main 11veen loksabhaa ke liye chunaav hua
 Another coalition government was formed at the center
 congress gathbandhan sarkaar ko baahar se samarthan de rahi thi
 This time a new experiment was made in the selection of the new Lok Sabha speaker, under which the ruling party or the front did not retain this important post and gave it to the Congress supporting the government from outside
 congress ne purvottar ke adivasee netaa or prakhar vaktaa pie sangama ko spikar ke rup main chunaa
 He could remain in this post for only two years (1 year 304 days) as the Lok Sabha was dissolved before time
 bataur spikar unka kaarykaal behad saraahneey rahaa kyonki satta or vipaksh kisi bhi ore se un par koi aarope nahin lage
 At a time when the Lok Sabha was hung, he kept all the leaders in the House united and he kept the House running smoothly
 unke kaarykaal kii khaas baat yah rahi ki hindi bhashi nahin hone ke baavjood unhone sadan main hindi bhashaa kaa istemaal kiya
 Later, PA Sangma also contested the presidential election
 dalit samaaj kaa pehla spikar90 ke dashak ke ant main desh gathbandhan ke daur se guzar rahaa tha or 1998 main hue madhyavadhi chunaav se 12veen loksabhaa kaa gathan kiya gaya
 This time the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led coalition government (NDA) was formed at the center
 atal bihari vaajapeyi sarkaar ne bhi pichhali sanyukt morcha sarkaar kii parampara ko jari rakhte hue spikar kaa pad apane paas nahin rakhaa or baahar se samarthan de rahi dal telugu desham party (tidipi) ko de diya
 GMC Balayogi was elected unopposed speaker from TDP
 balyogi ko desh ke pehle dalit spikar hone kaa gaurav hasil he
 The term of the 12th Lok Sabha was only 13 months
 1 vot se bachaa sakate the vaajapeyi kii sarkatiotal bihari vaajapeyi sarkaar avishvaas prastaav par ek vot ke antar se gir gai
 If the Speaker wanted GMC Balayogi, then Congress member Giridhar Gomang, who was also the Chief Minister of Odisha at the time, could prevent the fall of the Vajpayee government by preventing him from voting or using his decisive vote as the speaker
 Were, but he held the position and did not do so
 1999 ke ek or madhyavadhi chunaav vaajapeyi kii aguwai main phir endie sarkaar bani or jiemasi balyogi hi agle spikar chune gaye lekin is baar bhi ve apana kaarykaal puraa nahin kar sake or march 2002 main ek vimaan haadase main maare gaye
 The first left speaker was formed by the Congress-led UPA government in the 14th Lok Sabha election in 2004 and the Manmohan Singh government too did not keep the post following the previous rules and gave it to the Communist Party of India (CPI) supporting from outside Somnath Chatterjee became the 14th speaker of the Lok Sabha
 chatarji desh ke pehle aise vampanthi netaa hai jinhen loksabhaa spikar banane kaa gaurav hasil hua
 a strong stature like a wrestler, Chatterjee used to scold the mps when they created a ruckus during the proceedings of the House
 agast 2006 main bijepi ne un par pakshpaat karne kaa aarope lagaate hue patr likhaa tha, jis par purv pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi ke hastakshar bhi the, or isko lekar kaaphi hangaamaa bhi hua
 Somnath Chatterjee was extremely hurt by Atal Bihari Vajpayee's signature on the letter alleging favoritism when he called Vajpayee
 is sambandh main somnath chatarji ne atal bihari vaajapeyi ko phone milaayaa or is baat par naaraazgi jaahir kii ki, unhone (vaajapeyi ne) patr par hastakshar kiye
 Does Vajpayee also believe that as president Somnath Chatterjee discriminates? Somnath said, "if so, i resign from my post today
" ' somnath kii baat sunakar vaajapeyi ne kaha, 'commered, bataur bijepi sadsy maine patr par dastakhat kiye hai
 If it does not sign, it does not conform to the discipline of the party
 lekin vyaktigat rup se yah main maanata hum ki, aap bataur adhyaksh bhedbhaav nahin karte
 Somnath Chatterjee was the Lok Sabha speaker for 5 years
 pehali mahila spikar2009 main 15veen loksabhaa kaa gathan hua to congress ne is baar spikar kaa pad apane paas rakhaa or mira kumaar ke rup main loksabhaa ko pehali mahila spikar mila
 During his tenure, the opposition created ruckus and walkouts in almost every session
 hameshaa muskuraane vaali mira kumaar kaa kaarykaal chunautibhara rahaa
 Sumitra Mahajan was accused of favoritism (photo-lok Sabha) Like a party worker, Mahajan became the Speaker of BJP in the 16th Lok Sabha formed in 2014 and she is the second woman to hold the post
 sumitra mahajan par kai baar satta paksh kaa saath dene ke aarope lage hai
 Sumitra Mahajan, popularly known as Tai, is said to have behaved like a party worker as a speaker
 kai maukon par mantriyon ke funsane kii sthiti yaa anya kisi tarah kii asahaj sthiti hone par apni ore se raay dene ke kaaran vah vivaadon main raheen
 Commenting on the controversy surrounding the amendment of the Atrocity Act in 2018, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, taking part in a session of the 16th Lok Sabha, said Sumitra Mahajan, "if i have given my son big chocolate and after some time he felt that he was so big Chocolate should not be eaten
 ham jabardastee usase chhinenge to vah roega, naaraaz hoga
 At least two-three people should explain to him, then the chocolate can be gently removed from his hand
 isi tarah act par bhi samaaj main vichaar-vimarsh hona chahie
 Several times during the speeches of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the table was also seen patting
 ab dekhnaa hoga ki om birla kis tarah se apni jimmedaari kaa nirvahan karte hai, vah satta paksh ke saath rahete hai yaa phir jis pad ke liye shapath lenge uske kartavyon kaa eemaandaaree se paalan karenge

 karthik ne kaha ki is baat kaa faisla tab kiya gaya jab team ko ehsaas hua ki logon kii bhavanaaen film ke trailor ko dekhakar aahat hui hai
 In the trailer of this film, Karthik Aryan's character Chintu Tyagi is complaining to his friend (aparshakti Khurana) about how there is a lack of sex in his life
 is dialog par he aapattitriller main chintu kahata he, 'bivi se sex maang len to ham bhikhaari
 If the wife refuses to have sex, we are persecutors
 or kisi tarah jugad laga ke usase sex hasil kar len na to balaatkaari bhi ham
 'this dialogue did not appeal to the public and people expressed a lot of displeasure over this dialogue on Twitter
 logon ne kaha ki marital rape koi majaak kii baat nahin he
 Along with this, there was a demand to remove this dialogue from the film
 karthik ne maangi maafijab karthik aryan se is vivaad ke bare main ek intervyuu ke dauraan poocha gaya to unhone kaha, 'jab film kaa trailor aayaa to hamen samaj aayaa ki hamen logon kii bhaawanaaon ko thes nahin pahunchaani chahie or hamen is dialog ko jald se jald hataa dena chahie

 Some sisters were looking for cheap pulses by making some space in the heat and the exhausting crowd of the market
 daal to is bazaar main har jagah sasti hi thi magar talash is baat kii ho rahi thi ki kiski daal sabase kam kharaab he
 While walking in this market on Sunday, i bumped into Sonia and Vandana

 Sonia has traveled two and a half kilometers between Mehrauli to Old Delhi station for cheap pulses and Vandana 33 between Dwarka to Mehrauli and Old Delhi
 4 kilometre kii duuri
 Similarly from Ghaziabad, i met a gentleman from Dadri who came to buy cheap pulses by holding a local train

 It took them one hour by local train to reach Dadri from Old Delhi

 By mixing different types of pulses, a new variety of mixed lentils was found, which people were not able to buy even at the rate of forty rupees per kg
 godaamon main jab chuuhe anaaj kii bori kaat dete hai or anaaj thodaa kharaab ho jaataa he to vah mithai pul ke bazaar ke kharidaaron ke liye bech diya jaataa he
 One woman said that their lentils are for both man and animal
 jo jis kaam ke liye kharid le or kha le

 dilli hoicourt ne swine flu se nipatane ke liye centre tathaa dilli sarkaar dwaara uthaae gaye kadamon par buudhvaar ko santosh jataate hue kaha ki adaalat main aisa koi bhi maamla nahin aayaa he, jisamen prashasan kii naakaami kii baat kahi gai ho
 Chief Justice rohinee tathaa nyaayadhish aar
 s
 andlau kii khandpeeth ne swine flu se nipatane ke liye tatkaal kadam uthaane ko lekar ek janhit yachika par aadesh paarit karte hue kaha, "is maamle main dilli tathaa centre sarkaar dwaara pehle jo kadam uthaae gaye hai or vartmaan main jo kadam uthaae ja rahe hai, usase ham santusht hai
 " swine flu ko lekar logon ke bich jaagrukta failaane ke mudde par nyaayalay ne kaha, "jahaan tak jan jaagrukta ko lekar suzav kii baat he, to dilli main rahane ke hamaare apane anubhav se hamane is baat ko mahasoos kiya he ki isamen koi kami nahin he
 " usne kaha, "is vishay par samaaj main vibhinn staron par charchaa hui he
 Already a lot of fear has spread about this disease
 " The PIL demanded that the government set up more laboratories in the national capital to check for swine flu at a cheaper rate
 nyaayalay ne kaha ki vah jaanch kii keemat ko kam karne ko lekar nirdesh nahin de saktaa, kyonki is sambandh main upyukt praadhikaar kaa gathan kiya gaya he, jinhone is mudde par dhyaan diya he
 The bench also said that the affidavit submitted by the government makes it clear that work is already going on in the direction of prevention and research of this disease
 nyaayalay ne kaha, "nyaayalay shahar ko chalaane kaa bhaar apane upar nahin le saktaa
 There has been no case of administration failure, on which action should be taken
 " Earlier, the central government had told the court that it is helping the state government on swine flu
 desh main 8 november ko notebandi kaa elaan karne ke baad pradhanmantri narendra modi japan ke daure par chale gaye the
 The special thing is that the central government announced demonetisation in the country and made efforts to make India a digital economy
 lekin is elaan ke turant baad japan kii yatra par pahunche piem modi vahaan rubaru hue cash iconomi se or vah bhi top gear main chalane vaali
 Most shops in Japan still do not take money through credit cards and debit cards
 jiske chalate vahaan log apane jeb main dheron cash lekar chalate hai
 Due to this, neither there is any problem in the economy of Japan nor does anyone have to face the problem of retail in shopping
 haalanki beete kuch saal se tranjaction ke nae cashles madhyamon (credit or debit card, appal pe) ne japan main jagah banaai he lekin beete 20 varshon ke dauraan cash tranjaction doguna ho chukaa he
 Statistics from the Central Bank of Japan say that as of October 2016, Japan's economy had 101 trillion yen in cash
 vahiin 2014 tak japan main hone vaale kul tranjaction main 80 fisadi hissaa cash kaa tha
 There is also a card, but in Cash is King's Cash system it is not that plastic money or cashless card is not present
 japan ne sabase pehle credit card kaa istemaal 1960 main kiya tha jab maaruti departmental store ne kharidari ke liye graahakon ko yah card jari kiya tha
 Today there are about 32 crore such credit cards in Japan, that is three credit cards per adult
 ise bhi padhein: notebandi moorkhtapurna faisla, 10 main se mines 10 numberh chidambarabantararashtriya plastic mani company master card ke mutabik aaj bhi japan main 38 fisadi se zyada tranjaction cash main hota he
 This is five times the cash transaction in France
 vahiin america main 20 fisadi or england main mahaj 11 fisadi cash tranjaction hota he
 After all, the biggest argument behind the trend of 'cash is King' Cash in Japan is that it is the safest medium
 japan main chori, chhinachapati or dakaiti na ke baraabar he
 People are not afraid to walk here carrying a lot of cash in their pockets or bags
 alam yah he ki yadi paison se bharaa aapkaa purse kahin gir jaae to bas intjaar kiijie, koi na koi jald use aapke pate par pahunchaa degaa or purse main pataa yaa idi na hone kii surat main najdiki police stesan par vah nishchit mil jayega
 ALSO READ: Congress's War - Small fish caught in demonetisation, crocodiles managed to get out, small shopkeepers are compelled ye chote or majhole dukandaar bainkon dwaara jari credit or debit card ke madhyam se tranjaction par fees kii sharton par taiyaar nahin ho pate, lihaaja vah in madhyamon ko puri tarah se nikaar dete hai
 Apart from this, such shopkeepers get another big benefit in the form of savings in income tax as they usually pay the loss of return in business every year
 lekin unki sankhya itani badi he ki sarkaar inakam tex thopane se kataraati he
 At the forefront of ATM technology, Japan is the world's leading country in terms of technology
 technology kii dhamak japan ke sabhi bade shaharon main saaf taur par dekhi ja sakati he
 As a result of this, atms of banks present in the big cities of the country, including the capital of Japan, give cash and exchange notes and coins, along with giving cash
 aapako yadi kisi dukandaar ko paise adaa karne hon, swaabhaavik he ki vah cash kii ummid karegaa, or aapke paas sirf debit yaa credit card he
 So there is no problem because you can remove notes and coins from your card from any ATM
 yadi aapke paas paise sirf note main hai to aap atm se muft main sikkon main footkar praapt kar sakate hai
 Apart from this, most ATM machines will also provide you notes in lieu of coins and all this arrangement is free because Cash is King in Japan
 ab aap hi bataaen jab japan apni saikadon saal puraani arthvyavastha ko bina badale chalaa saktaa he to kya pradhanmantri modi ko notebandi ke faisle ke baad turant kii japan yatra par yah hunar nahin siikhnaa tha
 Like the cities of Japan, the cities of India have become America and Europe

 'zila ghaziabad' ek badi starcast vaali film he, jisamen hai, sanjay dutt, arshad varsi, vivek obaroy, paresh rawal, divya datta or ashutosh rana
 The title of the film is 'zilla Ghaziabad' but you hardly see Ghaziabad in the film
 film faujee or satbir ke bich gagwor kii kahani he, jise khatm karnaa chaahate hai, preetam singh yani sanjay dutt
 According to reports, the film is based on some true events that took place in Ghaziabad in the 90s, but when it was given the film form, it emerged as a Bollywood film of the 80s and 90s
 nirdeshak anand kumaar 'dabang' 'singhm' or 'omkara' jaisi filmon se kaafii prerit dikhe, tabhi to stars kaa introdection seen, gane or koreographi in filmon se milti-julati nazar ai
 In the film, the item song appears to be forced

 The comments ab baat abhinay kii
 Arshad Warsi's performance is worthy
 sanjay dutt bhi kuch seens main achche dikhe, par lagata he diarector ne unase wo karvaa diya, jo shaayad unke bas kii baat nahin
 For example, they danced to the title song or some action scenes that were not delivered properly

 Actors like Ashutosh Rana were not used properly in the film
 kai seens main bajet kii kami nazar ai
 For example, the film's effects and music were seen making noise

 Director Anand Kumar was heavily inspired by films like 'dabangg' 'singham' and 'omkara', when the introduction scenes, songs and choreography of the stars resembled these films
 film main item song jabardastee daale hue nazar aate hai
 The film seems a bit cautious after interval, but by then the game is over

 Sanjay Dutt also looked good in some scenes, but it seems that the director got him done, which is probably not his case
 masalan unka tital song par naachna yaa kuch aise ection seens, jinhen sahi dhang se anjaam tak nahin pahunchaaya gaya
 Ravi Kishan's performance was good
 film main ashutosh rana jaise actor kaa istemaal dhang se nahin hua
 Many scenes showed lack of budget
 masalan film ke effects or sangeet shor machaate nazar aae
 Overall it is a simple film, hence the film 2 stars from our side

 Jitanram Manjhi on Monday accused Paswan that his party was a brother-son party
 maanjhi ne ye bhi kaha tha ki wo kisi bhi haal main 13 se kam siten nahin lenge
 Here, the LJP did not openly say anything against Manjhi, but she will present herself in front of Anant Kumar today
 beete somvaar ko hi takaraar kaa taaja udhaaharan us samay dekhne ko mila, jab purv mukhyamantri jithan ram maanjhi ne tikhe shabdon main kendriya mantri ramvilas paswan par hamalaa bolaa
 Manjhi attacked Paswan for the first time in response to questions from reporters in his constituency Makhdumpur
 darasal, maanjhi har maukey par paswan dwaara unhen nicha dikhaae jane par na keval pareshaan the, balki unhone man bana liya ki ab paswan se saarvajanik rup se do-do haath kar hisaab baraabar karenge
 Recently, while participating in a program of a channel, Ram Vilas Paswan had said that Manjhi is a state level leader, while he said about himself that he is a national level Dalit leader
 tippaniyan Not only this, Paswan sarcastically said that he has come new to the National Democratic Alliance and he has yet to prove whether he can transfer his caste Manjhi's vote
 isi ke jawaab main maanjhi ne apni bhadaas nikaalte hue kaha ki paswan ko keval apane parivaar kii chintaa rahati he na ki daliton kii or wo unhen cheentee samajhane kii galati na karen kyonki cheentee bhi hathi ko parrast kar sakati he
 Manjhi asked Paswan why his son, brother or son-in-law is in every position in his party
 nishchit rup se maanjhi ke is hamale kaa paswan ko andaja nahin tha or somvaar ko jab unki pratikriya poochi gayi to unhone sawaalon ko taal diya

 nishchit rup se maanjhi ke is hamale kaa paswan ko andaja nahin tha or somvaar ko jab unki pratikriya poochi gayi to unhone sawaalon ko taal diya
 The latest example of Takkar was seen on Monday, when former Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi attacked Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan in sharp words
 maanjhi ne apane chunaav kshetra makhdumpur main patrakaron ke sawaalon ke jawaab main pehali baar paswan par sidhaa hamalaa bolaa
 In fact, Manjhi was not only upset about Paswan being let down by him at every opportunity, but he made up his mind that now he would be able to settle the accounts publicly with Paswan
 pichley dinon ek channel ke kaarykram main bhaag lete hue ramvilas paswan ne kaha tha ki maanjhi rajya str netaa hai, jabaki apane bare main unhone kaha ki wo rashtriya str ke dalit netaa hai
 The comments yahi nahin paswan ne maanjhi par vyangy karte hue kaha ki wo rashtriya loktrantik gathbandhan main nae-nae aae hai or unhen abhi sabit karnaa baaki he ki wo apni jati maanjhi kaa vot trsanfer kara pate hai ki nahin
 Responding to this, Manjhi said that he is worried about his family and not the Dalits and should not make the mistake of considering them as ants, because ants can also defeat elephants
 maanjhi ne paswan se poocha ki aakhir unki party main har pad par unke bete, bhai yaa damaad hi kyon asin hai
 Certainly Paswan was not aware of this attack by Manjhi and when asked his response on Monday, he deferred questions
 darasal, maanjhi har maukey par paswan dwaara unhen nicha dikhaae jane par na keval pareshaan the, balki unhone man bana liya ki ab paswan se saarvajanik rup se do-do haath kar hisaab baraabar karenge

 Manjhi asked Paswan why his son, brother or son-in-law is in every position in his party
 nishchit rup se maanjhi ke is hamale kaa paswan ko andaja nahin tha or somvaar ko jab unki pratikriya poochi gayi to unhone sawaalon ko taal diya

 The Kamal Nath government of Madhya Pradesh has given a big shock to the youth who are looking for unemployment allowance

 yojana ke tahat yuvaaon ko saal main 100 din kaa prashikshan or rojgaar milanaa tha
 In this period, the honorarium was to be given to these youths in the form of a sum of Rs 13 thousand or Rs 4000 per month
 jisase kamalnath sarkaar mukar gai he

" pradhanmantri ne report main kaha, in ghatnakramon ne shashan kii sthiti or bhrashtachar kii vyapaktaa ko lekar kai nagarikon ko chintaa main daal diya he
 These are rational concerns and the UPA government is determined to take corrective measures

 The Rajasthan cricket team has won the Ranji Trophy for the second time in a row
 isse pehle rajasthan kii team ne kabhi ranjai trophy nahin jiti thi
 The state has not had any Test player for decades

 R
 paridaa par ashrith he
 Together, all three become a major inspiration for the team, which hardly has a face that the cricketing crowd recognizes
 team ke paas koi nami coach bhi nahin he
 Head coach Amit Asawa himself has been a Ranji player
 25 janvari 2012: tasveeron main dekhen india todatim kaa yah pradarshan to tab he jabaki pichley saal ranjai trophy jeetne par rajya kii khilaadiyon tak nahin pahunch sakaa he
 Obviously, all the credit goes to the coach and the captain
 18 janvari 2012: tasveeron main dekhen india todeshuruyaat ke paanch match lagaataar haarane ke baad phir se sangharsh main aane kii vajah thi team bhaavana
 Losing five matches in a row was as delicate a chance as the team reached its worst level after coaching Australian cricketer Greg Chappell and then calling Asawa, who had no ego of any kind, last year
 
 11 janvari 2012: tasveeron main dekhen india tudeis baar, khilaadiyon main matbhedon kii khabaren ain or asava ke ravaie par sawaal uthaae gaye, tab bhi team prabandhan ne asava or unke bharose ke khilaadiyon ke hi saath bane rahane kaa faisla kiya
 The team management hired former South African fast bowler Mavrik Pringle as the bowling coach for some matches
 isse gendbaajon ko durust karne main madad mili, jo apane sarvshereshth pradarshan se bhatak rahe the
 4 January 2012: See India Today in pictures Rishikesh Kanitkar scored 506 runs in eight matches and led by example
 ranjai ke final main ve do baar lagaataar apni team ko vijay dilaa sake, yah prashansa yogya baat he
 28 December 2011: In pictures, see India Today, Saxena scored 897 runs in ten matches, including a double century in the final against Tamil Nadu
 final muqablon main unhone paanchon din ballebaaji karke ek record banaaya
 Akash Chopra scored 615 runs in nine matches, and R

 Parida scored 425 runs in 10 matches
 ashok menaria ne maatr paanch maichon main 462 ran bana kar apni shreshthata dikhaa di
 He is considered a potential batsman, who had to be dropped from the Ranji team due to illness
 pichley varsh kii khoj maane gaye deepak chahaar chaar maichon main keval chah wicket le paae
 Rituraj Singh emerged as the tournament hunt, taking 26 wickets in just 4 matches
 isi tarah robin bisht ne maatr 10 maichon main 1,034 ran bana daale
 He is expected to be considered for the national team based on his performance in Ranji
 sahi samay par sabhi ke pradarshan ke boote vijeta banane vaali yah team puri hoti he sumit maathur (8 maichon main 25 wicket), vivek yadav (5 maichon main 17 wicket) or dishanth yagnik (6 maichon main 19 shikaar) se
 a little credit must indeed be given to Lalit Modi, who has made it a great cricket training ground by bringing all the facilities to the Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur
 uske baad se to rajasthan cricket association main sirf vibhinn guton main jhagade hi dekhe gaye hai, jinamein baat-baat par dosti dushmani main badal jaati he
 The Sports Council exerts its full power to disrupt the association's work

 Dixit and Rajasthan State Sports Council President Shivcharan Mali were old companions, but later turned against each other
 shuruaati maichon main team kaa kharaab pradarshan bhi association main lagaataar chalane vaale jhagadon ke kaaran tha
 Asawa insists that the association and team management have not let such problems affect team selection or performance
 ve kehete hai, ''unhone hastkshep nahin kiya or ve peshewar bane rahe
 "but the reality is that the team has won despite Joshi, Dixit and Mali, not because of them
 jeet kii kahani, coach kii jabanibeete saal jab ham ranjai trophy jite the, to ise ''parikthaon jaisi jeet
 It was dubbed ''
 galat bhi nahin tha
 This was the first time in domestic cricket that the team which is placed at the bottom of the group of laggards (plate) teams should win the trophy by defeating the famous teams
 is saal usee pradarshan ko doharaakar hamane us baat ko betuka sabit kar diya he
 All this happened 'despite all the difficulties'
 hamen elite tiimon ke kathin group main rakhaa gaya tha
 We had a strong competition with a winning history
 safar mushkilon bharaa tha or acha score banane ke baavjood shuruyaat ke paanch maichon main ham pehali pari main badhat lene main naakaam rahe the
 The bowling was not sitting
 har ek match main hamaara koi na koi gendbaaj form main nahin hota tha
 Many other mistakes were also made from the players
 paanchaven match ke baad hamaare sirf paanch ank the
 The hope of being able to qualify was clouded
 charchaa shuru ho gai thi ki elite group main ham tike bhi rah sakavge yaa nahin
 Then there was charisma
 chhathwein match main hamane saurashtra kii shaktishaalee team ko sidhe haraa diya or nirnaayak paanch ank hasil kar liye
 We also got the right team combination by including in-form medium-speed fast bowler, middle-order batsman and wicketkeeper-batsman
 hamane shuruaati maichon main hue nuksaan ko dilo-dimag par haaavee nahin hone diya
 Six points were required to retain Odisha's hopes of qualifying the match
 saurashtra par jeet ke baad se sakaaratmak urja se labarej team ne phir ek baar shandaar krickwt khelaa or ank hasil kar liye
 Now we had come to a rhythm after qualifying
 hyderabad or haryana ko hamane unheen ke gharelu maidaanon par peeta
 It was not easy and both these matches brought fragile opportunities, due to which we were able to overcome our players' hard work and responsibility in the difficult conditions
 hamaari ranneeti thi-paristhitiyon ke anuroop sidhi saral yojana banaai jaae or use behtareen dhang se lagu kiya jaae
 Tamil Nadu were playing at home in the final and were apparently the favorite team
 vastav main yah hamaare bhi manamafik tha or ham chhipe rustam ban kar khush the
 Although Tamil Nadu played a similar cricketer throughout the tournament, they won one overall against our three straight wins
 lihaaja, toss jeetne ke baad, hamen pataa tha ki agar ham paryaapt ran bana sake, to hamaare paas aisi gendbaaji thi, jo unki majboot ballebaaji kii qatari ko dabaav main le sakati thi
 Our strategy worked and we batted with great tenacity keeping pace with the conditions and set up a huge score of 621 runs
 kul milakar hamaari safalataa ke kaaran the-shreshthata par kendrit vyapak taiyaari, shandaar team combination or ekajutata
 Positive Mindset of Players and Support Staff
 isane hamen baaki sabhi tiimon se badhat de di

 The New York Times has attributed Modi's large number of Facebook fanfare to the widespread use of social media by Modi in his election campaign in the recent Lok Sabha elections
 is baat kaa bhi zikr kiya gaya he ki vah soshal media ko apni samvaad niti kaa mahatvapurn hissaa bana kar chal rahe hai

 But RJD leaders are making statements on Lalu's line after the raids
 party netaa manoj jha ne kaha ki modi kaa nayaa gathbandhan darasal sibiai or inakam tex vibhaag se hua he or mahagathbandhan atoot he
 Raghuvansh Prasad Singh, a former Union minister and close to Lalu, also reiterated that Lalu's statement has been misinterpreted and the Modi government is targeting Lalu to hide his failures
 isi tarj par argedy netaa shivanand tiwari ne bhi bijepi par kshetreey dalon ke khilaaf adchane paidaa karne kaa aarope lagaaya
 On the other hand, Congress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala also termed the alliance with Lalu as unbreakable and dismissed all speculations in the matter
 vipaksh kaa warlekin vipaksh ke liye ye mauka lalu ko gherne kaa tha
 BJP leader Sushil Modi, who has been accusing the RJD supremo's family of scam for the last two months, called Lalu the mastermind of the alleged racket of benami properties and demanded an inquiry from Chief Minister Nitish Kumar
 kendriya mantri ravishankar prasad ke tanj isse zyada tikhe the

 He also demanded the implementation of the same law on Lalu
 prasad kaa kahana tha ki nitish kumaar main lalu ke beton ko mantrimandal se hataane kii himmat nahin he
 At the same time, Ram Vilas Paswan, the leader of the Lok Janshakti Party and the minister at the center, asked Nitish whether the grand alliance is unbreakable even in the case of corruption? Bahubali leader of Jan Adhikar Party Pappu Yadav also advised the Bihar Chief Minister to break away from Lalu's party

 But Yogendra, who calls himself a "political animal" in the profile of his Twitter account, has a tendency towards politics from the beginning
 isliye jab anna hajaare ke bhrashtachar ke khilaaf jan andolan kii gaadi arvind kejariwal ne raajnneeti kii patari par daudai to yogendra us par fouran savaar ho gaye
 He admits, "when this movement turned into a political party, there was no reason for me to stay out of it

 "yogendra's increased activism on Anna's platform was part of Arvind's same strategy, which he transformed into the Aam Aadmi Party
 jald hi ve aap ke samvidhan se lekar anya dastavejon ko likhane lage
 On his growing influence in Arvind's team and Anna's departure, he says, "the person who meets the mainstream voice of the movement, everyone gets their attention
 yahi baat main ek saal se kah rahaa tha, lekin chunki tab meri aawaaj haashie kii aawaaj thi isliye kisi ne nahin suni
 "so, did the person doing political analysis of elections on TV channels in his particular style suddenly start batting himself on the pitch of politics? Yogendra's association with politics dates back to the 1980s
 ve jab dilli kii jawaharlal nehru uniwarsity main raajnneeti vigyaan se eme kii padhai karne pahunche to vahaan rajnatik dalon kaa cheharaa ban chuke esephai, abivipi, enesuai jaise chaatr sanghathan the

 bhanbhari ke mutabik yogendra ne ek seminar main khud kaha, ‘‘bhanbhari sahab ke bi plus kaa matlab tha ki mujhe bhartiya raajnneeti abhi bahut seekhni he
 "yogendra, who is quiet in class, but who listens intently, also warns him of affection as an old teacher," says Yogendra

 aakhir power nap kii sabase adhik jarurat unhen hi to he, he ki nahin? Pakistan's military has denied diplomatic access to Indian national Kulbhushan Jadhav
 kuch dinon pehle bharat ne rajanyik pahunch kii maang joardaar dhang se rakhi thi
 Jadhav (46) was sentenced to death last week by the Field General Court Martial in an alleged espionage case
 isko lekar bharat ne tikhi pratikriya vyakt kii or pakistan ko chetavanee di ki agar jadhav kii 'purvaniyojit hatya' ko anjaam diya gaya, to dwipaksheeya sambandhon ko nuksaan pahunch saktaa he

" ' baharhaal, nai dilli main bhartiya adhikariyon ne kaha ki rajanyik pahunch se inkaar kiye jane ko lekar pakistan kii taraf se koi soochna nahin di gai he
 Pakistan has rejected India's demand for diplomatic access to Jadhav nearly a dozen times in the last one year
 major general gafoor ne kaha ki jadhav raashtra virdohi gatividhiyon main shaamil tha isliye use court marshall kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 The comments unhone kaha, 'yah (jadhav ko pakadana or dandit karnaa) sena kaa ferj tha
 We did not compromise on this and sentenced him

 a bug has been found in Apple ios that can lock nearby iphones
 ye khami airdrop main pai gai he jiske tahat Apple ke divaais ke bich file transfar kii jaati hai
 By taking advantage of this bug, attackers can send files continuously and eventually a situation of phone lock can occur
 security research kishan bagaaria ne is bag kaa khulaasa kiya he
 Phones can be locked by sending files to nearby ios devices, ie those in the iphone or ipad wireless range
 file risive hone par ios tab tak smartphone kii disple block karke rakhata he jab tak aap file ko accept yaa riject na karen
 Attackers can continue sending files to block the use of the phone
 chunki ios main khami ye he ki is oparating system main aisa koi praavdhaan nahin he ki airdrop se kitni files risive kii ja sakati hai
 Attackers can affect the device by sending files continuously
 open sorce tul ke jariye bagaaria ne airdrop ke range main Apple divaais main lagaataar files bheji hai
 a target can be any device that is in the wireless range
 inhone utyub par video bhi aplod kiya jisamen wo iskaa demonstrishan de rahe hai
 Kishan Bagaria has named this bug as airdos which is a type of denial of service attack that can block user access for some time
 dhyaan dene vaali baat ye he ki is bag se sirf wo log prabhavit ho sakate hai jinhone airdrop ko Everyone set kar rakhaa he
 It cannot attack when Bluetooth is off
 bagaaria kaa kahana he ki sabase mushkil kaam ye he ki agar ye atake shuru ho gaya to phone kaa bluetooth bhi of karnaa naammumkin jaisaa he, kyonki lagaataar ye box bana rahata he or aap phone yuj nahin kar pate hai
 Now Apple has released an update to fix this
 ios 13
 3 does not have this issue
 agar aapane apane iphone ko apadet nahin kiya he to settings main ja kar ios 13
 Make 3 updates

 rajdhani dilli main vaayu pradooshan kii samasya se nipatane ke liye rail mantri suresh prabhu ne ek anokhi pahal kii he
 This initiative is to get trucks carrying air pollution in Delhi from the border of Delhi to the train and crossing Delhi
 railway ki is seva ko role on role of yani ro-ro ke taur par janaa jaataa he
 The Railway Ministry has started the work of transporting trucks from Harsaru railway station of Gurugram to Moradnagar railway station in Uttar Pradesh under ro-ro service from 2 March
 gauratlab he ki konkan railway main bahut safal tareeke se ro-ro seva pehle se hi di ja rahi he
 Pollution will be affected on this occasion, Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu said that one-third of the pollution that people in Delhi face due to air pollution is due to trucks going through Delhi
 lihaaja railway ne dilli ke border se trakon ko ladakar railgadee ke jariye icchit border par chhodane kaa kaam shuru kar diya he
 Suresh Prabhu told journalists that ro-ro service would greatly affect Delhi's pollution and trucks would not have to wait at the Delhi border to reach their location
 dobaaraa shuru hogi ring railway!railmantri ne kaha ki rajdhani dilli ko ro-ro seva dene ke saath hi ab railway yahaan par maujuud ring railway ko lekar jald hi badi ghoshnaa karne kii taiyaari main he
 There is constant pressure on the railways to revive the ring railway in an active manner
 ring railway dobaaraa shuru hone se dilli waalon ko khaasi raahat mil sakegi
 2500 to 3000 rupees per truck fare
 Northern Railway General Manager RK Kulshrestha has expected the impact of air pollution in the capital with the introduction of ro-ro service
 uthhke mutabik abhi payalat project ke tahat gurugram ke harsaru railway stesan se trakon ko ro-ro sarvice ke tahat uttar pradesh ke muradanagar railway stesan par trek pahuchane kaa kaam shuru hua he
 Based on the experience gained in the pilot project, Railways will start ro-ro service on eight other routes of Delhi
 jab ye sabhi sevaayen shuru ho jaaegin to dilli ke border par trakon ko ab intjaar nahin karnaa padegaa
 Railways have fixed the fare of 2500 to 3000 rupees per truck for this service
 honge kai phyderelway board ke member trephic mohammad jamshed ke mutabik 2016-2017 ke rail bajet main maal bhaade main ijapha karne ke liye nae tareeke develop karne kii baat kahi gai thi
 In view of this, the Railways have tried to solve a big problem of Delhi NCR
 mohammad jamshed ke mutabik dilli ensiaar main har din takreeban 6 xxrep 4 0 trek aate-jate hai
 Of these trucks, around 15,000 trucks enter the border of Delhi and cross Delhi and go to other states
 iskaa sidhaa sa matlab yah hua ki yah trek dilli ke liye nahin hai balki dilli ke raste se hote hue yah duusare rajyon ko jate hai
 These trucks passing through Delhi have to pay green tax, toll tax has to be paid, MCD has to pay tax
 uske baad bhi in vaahanon ko rajdhani se hokar guzarane ke liye sirf raat ke chand ghante hi mil pate hai
 In such a situation, there are long queues of trucks at night at the border in the capital Delhi
 raat ke vakt jab yah trek dilli se hokar guzarate hai to inase rajdhani kii hawa bahut zyada pradooshit hoti he
 Due to increasing pollution in the capital, there has been increasing concern for the last few years and there have been many unsuccessful attempts to find a solution
 nahin karnaa hoga ghanton intjarmember trephic mohammad jamshed ke mutabik dilli ensiaar main kul milakar 127 entry or agsit point hai
 But 9 of these are entry and exit points through which 75 percent of Delhi's truck passes
 lihaaja railway ne in 9 entry or agsit point ko dhyaan main rakhte hue ro-ro seva ke liye apni yojana taiyaar kii he
 Mohammad Jamshed says that as a pilot project, a route has been opened to take trucks across
 is par milane vaale rispance ke baad baaki 8 rooton ko bhi khol diya jayega
 According to him, where the truckers will no longer have to wait for hours, the poisonous smoke of trucks in delhi-ncr will not make the environment poisonous
 isse dilli kii sadakon par trephic kuch had tak kam ho sakegaa vahiin duusari taraf railway ko maal bhaade main kamai bhi ho paaegi
 According to officials of the railways, the trucks will have to pay around three and a half thousand rupees for ro-ro service, while it will save 8 to 10 hours for the truck passing through Delhi
 is seva kaa istemaal karne vaale trakon ko envyranment companseshan charge nahin dena padegaa
 Following the ngt's order, environmental compensation charges were levied on heavy vehicles in Delhi
 isi ke saath ro-ro seva kaa istemaal karne vaale trakon ko dilli main ghusane par 500 se lekar ₹900 tak ke toll tex kii bachat hogi
