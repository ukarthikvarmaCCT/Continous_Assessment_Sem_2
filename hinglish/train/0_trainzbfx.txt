 On the second day of the fast, it was also seen that social activist Mallika Sarabhai and about 20 people who had gone out to protest against it were taken into custody
 isi bich, congress ne phir se modi par nishaanaa sadhate hue naitik aadhaar par unke istife kii maang kii he
 Modi said on the second day of the fast, "sadbhavna mission is not for any particular community or religion

 The progress of Gujarat has shown the way forward
 " modi ne apane sambodhan main kaha, "gujarat ne apaar pidaa sahi he
 i have sympathy for the families of the victims
 main abhi bhi us pidaa ko mahasoos kar saktaa hum
 "the 2002 communal riots in Gujarat killed at least 1,000 people and most of them were Muslims
 unhone kaha, "yah mishan jodne ke liye he, todane ke liye nahin
 Gujarat is my family
 chah karod gujaratiyon kii khushi, gam, sapane or aakankshaayen meri hai
 "be aware that Modi's fast at Gujarat University is being seen as an attempt to woo the minorities
 modi ne apane 10 varsh ke shashan ke dauraan kii uplabdhiyon kaa zikr kiya or kaha ki unka upwas shanti, ekta or sadbhaav ke liye he
 Like Modi, senior Gujarat Congress leader Shankar Singh Vaghela, sitting on a parallel fast, demanded his resignation over Modi's statement that he had said that no FIR was lodged against him during the 2002 riots
 waghela ne kaha, "vah sahi bol rahe hai
 At that time it was very difficult to register an FIR against anyone
 mujhe chintaa he ki praathmiki darj nahin hue
 "he said," Modi should take the moral responsibility that the people were killed and the police was responsible for their safety
 " unhone kaha ki us samay police ko kaha gaya tha ki ve kuch na karen kyonki godhra railcand kii pratikriya ho chuki he
 Vaghela said, "ehsan Jafri had been calling for half an hour
 kahaan tha us vakt police prashasan
 "why did the police not reach to save Jafri
 unhone kaha ki dangon main jo bhi hindu yaa musalmaan maare gaye, darasal ve sabhi gujarati the

 a lawyer by profession, Sinha and others were taken to the police headquarters near the Noorani Mosque
 sinha ne kaha, "nyaay ke bina koi sadbhaavna nahin ho sakati
 "according to Sarabhai, while being taken to the police station, he was told by an officer of the police that the police had received instructions on Saturday morning to arrest him before the protest at Naroda Patiya
 saamaajik kaaryakarta ne kaha ki police stesan le jate samay police ne unhen koi kaaran nahin bataaya
 He said, "the police did not give any reason for his detention
 
 Police said they had received instructions to do so
 " gyaat ho ki modi ke teen dinon ke upwas kii ninda karte hue sarabhai ne poocha ki us 'sadbhaavna' kaa kya matlab he jab varsh 2002 ke gujarat dangon ke peediton ko 10 varsh ke baad bhi nyaay nahin mila he
 He said, "we were going to have a peaceful demonstration
 mujhe nahin pataa ki mere upar kya aarope lagaae ja rahe hai
 "earlier Sarabhai accused the Chief Minister of attempting to use public money to bribe his lawyer to undermine his petition filed in the Supreme Court regarding the 2002 riots

 If the Delhi government explained its work done in two years, BJP too was not behind in preparing the report card
 bijepi ke dilli pradesh adhyaksh manoj tiwari mangalvaar ko kejariwal kaa report card lekar saamne aae, to kejariwal ko gherne main koi kasar nahin chodi
 Kejriwal government of Delhi has been given minus three out of ten in Delhi bjp's report card
 bijepi isaki vajah bhi bataa rahi he, kyon dilli sarkaar kaa report card mines marking main chalaa gaya
 The Delhi government has prepared a separate report card from its ministers, which outlines the achievements of the government
 do saal main apni sarkaar ko bemisaal bataane ke liye kejariwal ke photo ke saath akhabaaron main vigyaapan bhi chhapavaaye gaye hai
 The schemes launched in Delhi ranging from electricity-water to education and health have been counted by the government as achievements, but the BJP has given the slogan of 'delhi Behala in two years'
 bijepi ne sarkaar kii uplabdhiyon ko nakaarte hue apni taraf se silsilewar report card taiyaar karavaaya he
 While issuing the report card, Delhi BJP President Manoj Tiwari said that he did not do what the government should have done
 jo sarkaar ke rosemara ke kaam hai, sarkaar wo bhi thik se nahin kar pai, balki sarkari vyavastha or chaupat ho gai he
 In such a situation, the normal functioning of the government has also been zero

 In the course of two years, the government did such things that not only caused the loss of Delhi, but also deceived the people of Delhi

 In such a situation, the report card of the Kejriwal government is entitled to the number in minus

 doodh or fal sabji kaa utpaadan badaae kii raftaar anaaj kii tulana main chaar se aath guna zyada he
 They account for 20 to 30 per cent of the earnings of small and medium farmers
 pichley teen saal main in donon utpaada virgon ko mandi ne chapeta he
 Due to lack of infrastructure and limited processing facilities both are full of production and prices are low
 isliye doodh kii keemat ko lekar andolan ho rahe hai
 Consumer inflation figures reflect this slowdown
 gaanvon main gussa yun hi nahin khadbada rahaa he
 The urban recession is adding to the troubles of the villages
 pichley do saal main bade paimaane par shaharon se gaanvon kii ore shramikon kaa palaayan hua he
 Now that there is less work in the village and more hands are asking for it, how will the wages increase? Where is the earning: In the last six months, the rate of wages in the villages has come down to three percent, which is the lowest level in the last ten years
 ek taaja report (jeem financial-rural safari) bataati he ki sookhe ke pichley daur main bhawan nirmaan, baaluu khanan, buniyadi dhaancha nirmaan, deyari, poltry aadi se gaiyr krishi aay ne gaanvon kii madad kii thi
 But post demonetisation GST has also affected this
 gaiyr krishi aay kam hone kaa sabase zyada asar purvi bharat ke rajyon main dikhataa he
 Meanwhile, land prices in villages have also declined steadily since 2015
 mahangaai ke panje: anaaj se samarthan mulya main jitani badhat hui he uskaa ek bada hissaa to rabi kii kheti kii badi hui laagat chaat jaaegi
 The price of fertilizers is going to increase by 5 to 28 percent after the spread of crude oil to the raw material of fertilizers
 diapi kii keemat to bad hi gai he, mahangaa dijal rabi kii singhai mahangi karegaa
 Now the opportunity to see the effects of monsoon, decrease in rural income and recession in villages is in the light of political data rather than economic
 yaad rahe ki gujarat ke chunaavon main gaanvon ke gusse ne bhaajapa ko haar kii dahalij tak pahunchaa diya tha
 Madhya Pradesh is in line to mandate
 haryana, punjab, gujarat, maharashtra, uttar pradesh or madhya pradesh aise rajya hai jahaan 2015 se 2019 ke bich do se lekar paanch saal tak monsoon kharaab rahaa he; gramin aay badaae kii raftaar main ye rajya sabase peeche or kisaan aatmahatya main sabase aage hai
 It is worth mentioning that there are 204 Lok Sabha seats in these states affected by the rural recession
 or itihaas bataata he ki bharat ke gaanv chunavi ummiido ke sabase apratyaashit dushman hai
 The anger of the villages almost defeated the BJP in the Gujarat elections

 Asked whether the party would take up a ministerial berth in such a government as it had only supported the Congress government from outside in the last elections
 unhone kaha agar sammanjanak samjhauta hota he to isamen koi buraai nahin he
 Yadav claimed that the sp's alliance with former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Kalyan Singh did not deteriorate its Muslim vote bank
 unhone kaha ki muslim puure utsaah se matdaan kar rahe hai or is baar bhi karenge
 They are not against us
 upi vidhansabha chunaav ke tisare charan main 12 jilon kii 69 siton par 19 farvari ko matdaan hona he
 Etawah and its adjoining districts are also considered strongholds of SP in these phases
 aapako bataa den ki tisare charan main farrukhabad, hardoi, kannauj, mainpuri, itawa, auraiya, kanpur dehaat, kanpur nagar, unnav, lakhanu, barabanki or sitapur main voting honi he
 But all eyes are on the Cantt assembly seat in Lucknow district
 sapa ke liye yah mahaj ek seat nahin he balki 'parivaar kii izzat' kaa maamla he
 Actually, Aparna Yadav, the younger daughter-in-law of Mulayam Singh Yadav from Cantt seat, is in the fray
 unki ladaai is baar bijepi ke tikat par chunaav lard raheen reeta bahuguna joshi se he
 Rita had won the last elections on a Congress ticket from the Cantt seat
 ab unke saath bijepi kaa bhi vot bank he yahi vajah he ki aparnaa ko jitaane ke liye samaajawaadee party ne apni qamar kas lee he
 The whole family came forward
 On Monday, Mulayam Singh campaigned for Aparna and took part in the rally
 mulaayam singh ne kaha tha, "aparnaa mere ladke kii bahu he, isliye mere sammaan kii baat he
 To give him a victory " mulaayam ne aage yah bhi kaha tha ki aparnaa agar jeetegi to vahaan bahut kaam karengi

 aparnaa ne dimple ke pair bhi chhue
 Dimple had said with an appeal to Aparna to win the election, "if i count the plans, it will be from morning to evening
 " raily main aparnaa ne kaha tha ki, "hamaari party ne bahut kaam kiya he
 The alliance was done because the breakers had to be stopped
 "guuruuvaar ko akhilesh yadav bhi kaint vidhansabha seat main aparnaa ke paksh main maahaul banane kii khatir raily karne vaale hai
 Only Mulayam had gone for Shivpal, it is worth mentioning that only Mulayam Singh Yadav had gone to campaign for Shivpal, while campaigning for Aparna Yadav has been handled by the entire family
 donon main he kaaman factor- reeta bahuguna joshi or aparnaa yadav donon hi uttarakhand se taalluk rakhti hai
 - Both have their eye on the hill votes of the region
 - reeta bahuguna joshi ke pita hemavanti nandan bahuguna upi ke nauven mukhyamantri rah chuke hai
 While Mulayam Singh Yadav, father-in-law of Aparna Yadav, has held power in UP three times

 anya jatigat matadaataaon main takreeban 50 hajaar dalit, 40 hajaar vaisya, 30 hajaar pichde varg ke log, 25 hajaar kshatriya or 20 hajaar muslim hai
 What does it say: Electoral mathematics has been considered an important role of the Brahmin voter in this field
 reeta bahuguna ne pichley chunaav main yahaan ke sindhi or pahari vot bank ke saath-saath brahman vot bank main bhi send lagaai thi

 In this letter he has told that if i seriously consider my speech given in Meerut on 9 April, it is known that the subject was started by the national president of an opposition party
 chitthee main yogi ne likhaa he ki 'aachaar samhita kaa ulanghan karte hue ek party kii adhyaksh (mayawati) ne musalamaanon se unki party ke samarthan main vot karne kii apil kii thi, isliye desh kaa ek jimmedaar naagarik hone ke kaaran meraa ferj banataa he ki aise logon kaa pardaafash kiya jaae'
 My unwavering faith in Bajrangbali - In this letter sent to the Yogi Election Commission, Yogi Adityanath also clarified the statement made about Bajrangbali

 6 saal kii ek maasoom paayal ko ek pagal kute ne aisa jakhm diya jise dekh or sun kar koi bhi sihar uthegaa
 The incident is on Saturday
 banaras se 70 kilometre dur ghazipur ke mirzapur gaanv main paayal apane hamaumr taqariban 10-12 bacchon ke saath ghar ke baahar khel rahi thi
 Suddenly, a brown dog came running from somewhere and directly attacked his mouth
 jab tak wo sanbhal paati tab tak uskaa munh kute ke jabade main samaa chukaa tha
 All the children were around, so all of a sudden this attack made them nervous and started screaming
 unka shor sun kar jab tak bade aate tab tak kute ne apane jabade main jakade paayal ke munh ke ek hisse ko noch daalaa or bhaag gaya
 Blood spilled all around Payal
 uski is dasha ko dekh kar uske parivaar waalon ke hosh ud gayi
 Nobody could understand what to do
 paayal kaa dard asahneeya tha or uski cheekh puure parivaar ko badahavaas kar rahi thi
 Seeing the news of this incident spread to the whole village
 maamla itnaa ajibo garib tha ki har kisi ke pair paayal ke ghar kii taraf daud chale
 Despite all the efforts, blood was not stopping from the mouth
 kisi tarah khun se lathpath paayal ko lekar uske ghar or gaanv vaale paas ke sai nath aspataal le gayi jahaan ke doctor bhi uski dasha ko dekhakar hairaan ho gayi
 Immediately, after first aid, he bandaged the blood flowing from any kind of injury and referred him to the Benares big hospital
 raat taqariban 10 baje paayal ko lekar uskaa parivaar varanasi ke gallexi aspataal ke immergency main pahunchaa
 Seeing his condition here too, the plastic surgeon Dr
 immediately
 rajeev kumaar, anaesthetic prashanth sahay or duusare doctoron ko bulaayaa gaya
 Payal's surgery started the night
 takreeban dhai ghante chali surgery main uske munh ke damege bhaag ko jitna sambhav ho sakaa utana repere kar pattee lagaai gai
 The comments chunki paayal ko ek pagal kute ne kaata tha or wo bhi munh ke paas lihaaja anti rebies injection ke saath duusare zaruri upachaar shuru kiye gayi
 Now Payal's condition is fine but after some time plastic surgery will be done again to completely cure his face
 jis kute ne paayal kii ye dasha kii wo gaayab ho gaya lekin ye pataa zarur chalaa ki is kute ne gaanv ke hi paanch chah logon ko or bhi kaata he
 a dog's mouth is such a painful incident of an innocent that is rarely heard
 aise main ye ghatana ye bhi bataati he ki kisi ko bhi aise laavaaris jaanwaron se sanbhal kar rahanaa chaiye
 In Mirzapur village of Ghazipur, 70 km from Banaras, Payal was playing outside her home with about 10-12 children of her age
 tabhi achaanak kahin se bhure rang kaa ek kutta daudta hua aayaa or sidhe uske munh par atake kar diya
 By the time she could recover, her mouth had settled in the dog's jaw
 aasapaas sab bachche hi the lihaaja achaanak hue is hamale se sab ghabara gayi or cheekhney chillane lage
 Hearing their noise, the dog scratched a part of Payal's mouth, which was stuck in his jaw and ran away
 paayal ke chaaron taraf khun hi khun fail gaya
 Seeing this situation, the senses of his family were blown away
 kisi ko kuch samaj main nahin aa rahaa tha kya karen
 Payal's pain was unbearable and his scream was bringing the whole family into disarray
 dekhte dekhte is ghatana kii khabar puure gaanv main fail gai
 The case was so strange that everyone's feet ran towards Payal's house
 tamaam koshishon ke baavjood munh se khun ruk nahin rahaa tha
 Somehow, the blood-soaked Payal took his house and the villagers to the nearby Sai Nath Hospital where the doctors were also surprised to see his condition
 foran unhone praathmik upachaar kar kisi tarah chot se behate khun ko roak kar pattee kii or banaras bade aspataal ke liye refer kar diya
 At around 10 o'clock at night, his family arrived at the Emergency of Galaxy Hospital in Varanasi with Payal
 yahaan bhi uski halaat ko dekh kar foran hi raat main plastic sarjan dow
 Rajiv Kumar, anesthetic Prashant Sahay and other doctors were called
 paayal kii raat main hi surgery shuru hui
 In the surgery that lasted for about two and a half hours, the damaged portion of his mouth was repaired as much as possible
 tippaniyan Since Payal was bitten by a rabid dog, he too started taking other necessary treatments with anti rabies injection near the mouth
 ab paayal kii haalat thik he lekin puri tarah uske chehre ko thik karne ke liye kuch samay baad phir se plastic surgery kii jaayegi
 The dog that made Payal's condition disappeared, but it was discovered that this dog has bitten five to six people from the village itself
 ek kute kaa kisi maasoom kaa is tarah munh noch lenaa apane aap main ek bahut dardanaak ghatana he jo shaayad hi kabhi suni gai ho
 In this case, this incident also tells that one should be careful with such unclaimed animals
 aasapaas sab bachche hi the lihaaja achaanak hue is hamale se sab ghabara gayi or cheekhney chillane lage
 Hearing their noise, the dog scratched a part of Payal's mouth, which was stuck in his jaw and ran away
 paayal ke chaaron taraf khun hi khun fail gaya
 Seeing this situation, the senses of his family were blown away
 kisi ko kuch samaj main nahin aa rahaa tha kya karen
 Payal's pain was unbearable and his scream was bringing the whole family into disarray
 dekhte dekhte is ghatana kii khabar puure gaanv main fail gai
 The case was so strange that everyone's feet ran towards Payal's house
 tamaam koshishon ke baavjood munh se khun ruk nahin rahaa tha
 Somehow, the blood-soaked Payal took his house and the villagers to the nearby Sai Nath Hospital where the doctors were also surprised to see his condition
 foran unhone praathmik upachaar kar kisi tarah chot se behate khun ko roak kar pattee kii or banaras bade aspataal ke liye refer kar diya
 At around 10 o'clock at night, his family arrived at the Emergency of Galaxy Hospital in Varanasi with Payal
 yahaan bhi uski halaat ko dekh kar foran hi raat main plastic sarjan dow
 Rajiv Kumar, anesthetic Prashant Sahay and other doctors were called
 paayal kii raat main hi surgery shuru hui
 In the surgery that lasted for about two and a half hours, the damaged portion of his mouth was repaired as much as possible
 tippaniyan Since Payal was bitten by a rabid dog, he too started taking other necessary treatments with anti rabies injection near the mouth
 ab paayal kii haalat thik he lekin puri tarah uske chehre ko thik karne ke liye kuch samay baad phir se plastic surgery kii jaayegi
 The dog that made Payal's condition disappeared, but it was discovered that this dog has bitten five to six people from the village itself
 ek kute kaa kisi maasoom kaa is tarah munh noch lenaa apane aap main ek bahut dardanaak ghatana he jo shaayad hi kabhi suni gai ho
 In this case, this incident also tells that one should be careful with such unclaimed animals
 paayal kaa dard asahneeya tha or uski cheekh puure parivaar ko badahavaas kar rahi thi
 Seeing the news of this incident spread to the whole village
 maamla itnaa ajibo garib tha ki har kisi ke pair paayal ke ghar kii taraf daud chale
 Despite all the efforts, blood was not stopping from the mouth
 kisi tarah khun se lathpath paayal ko lekar uske ghar or gaanv vaale paas ke sai nath aspataal le gayi jahaan ke doctor bhi uski dasha ko dekhakar hairaan ho gayi
 Immediately, after first aid, he bandaged the blood flowing from any kind of injury and referred him to the Benares big hospital
 raat taqariban 10 baje paayal ko lekar uskaa parivaar varanasi ke gallexi aspataal ke immergency main pahunchaa
 Seeing his condition here too, the plastic surgeon Dr
 immediately
 rajeev kumaar, anaesthetic prashanth sahay or duusare doctoron ko bulaayaa gaya
 Payal's surgery started the night
 takreeban dhai ghante chali surgery main uske munh ke damege bhaag ko jitna sambhav ho sakaa utana repere kar pattee lagaai gai
 The comments chunki paayal ko ek pagal kute ne kaata tha or wo bhi munh ke paas lihaaja anti rebies injection ke saath duusare zaruri upachaar shuru kiye gayi
 Now Payal's condition is fine but after some time plastic surgery will be done again to completely cure his face
 jis kute ne paayal kii ye dasha kii wo gaayab ho gaya lekin ye pataa zarur chalaa ki is kute ne gaanv ke hi paanch chah logon ko or bhi kaata he
 a dog's mouth is such a painful incident of an innocent that is rarely heard
 aise main ye ghatana ye bhi bataati he ki kisi ko bhi aise laavaaris jaanwaron se sanbhal kar rahanaa chaiye

 - Light a lamp there and pray for grace from the tree
 - iske baad vahiin vatvriksh ke neeche baithkar shani mantra kaa jaap karen

 Ever since Amit Shah took over as bjp's national president in 2014, caste equations have made a place in the party as a well-planned strategy, culminating in the steady flow of leaders of many parties and castes
 happened
 darasal, loksabhaa chunaav se takreeban ek maah pehle dilli main bhaajapa mukhyalay main party main shaamil hone waalon kii taadaad is kadar thi ki media ke ek hisse main bhaajapa ke liye ek nayaa naam—bharat bhartee party garh liya gaya
 The bjp's caste management policy, coined under Shah's patronage, has a two-pronged objective: to create broad representation from the various castes of the country to maintain an all-hindu party image and second, to establish influence in areas where the party is based on caste lines Weakness shah ise bhaajapa kii jati samaveshi ranneeti kaa naam dete hai
 He says, "its purpose is to carry all the castes together under a nationalist mindset
" hamane uttar pradesh main yah kar dikhaaya he jahaan hamane tikaton ke bantwaare main choti se choti jatiyon kaa dhyaan rakhaa tha
 "the same strategy was applied in the context of tribal groups in establishing a 'rainbow coalition' in the Northeast
 shah kehete hai, ''jati aadhaarit or chhadam-dharmanirpeksh partiyaan iske ulat keval kuch khaas samoohon par dhyaan kendrit karti hai or baakiyon ko chhod detii hai or is tarah se ve khalis jatigat card khelti hai
 "bjp's organization secretary Ramlal says the bjp's caste strategy is based on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's slogan of 'sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas'
 uttar pradesh, maharashtra, bihar, madhya pradesh or pashchim bengal jaise bade rajyon main bhaajapa ne jati kaa card badi hoshiyaari se khelaa he, jisamen shah ne kshetreey nazariye ko dhyaan main rakhane ke saath hi nirvachan kshetra vishesh ke jatigat samikarnon par bhi paini nigaah rakhi he
 In this whole exercise, trying to attract the leaders of different castes is very important
 misaal ke taur par kul 48 siton vaale maharashtra main devendra fadavis ke netritv vaali bhaajapa sarkaar ne andolnarat maratha samoohon ko shiksha or naukari main 16 fisadi aarakshan kii peshkash kii
 Now the party has included prominent Maratha faces and leaders of the Lingayat community dominating the border areas of the state adjoining Karnataka
 ek prabhaavshaalee lingayat guru jai siddheshwar ko party main shaamil karke unhen sholapur se loksabhaa seat ke liye ummidavaar banaaya gaya he
 The BJP is eyeing the maratha-lingayat axis in this constituency
 purv up-mukhyamantri vijay singh mohite-patil ke putr ranjitsingh mohite-patil bhi ensipi chhodkar bhaajapa main shaamil ho chuke hai
 Another Maratha leader of the BJP is Satara District Congress President Ranjitsinh naik-nimbalkar who has been fielded from Madha
 party main chauthi pramukh pravishti sujay vikhe patil kii rahi he jo congress ke prabhaavshaalee maratha netaa or vipaksh ke netaa radhakrishna vikhe patil ke bete hai
 He is contesting from Ahmednagar
 uttar pradesh main bhaajapa, bahujan samaaj party (basapa) or samaajawaadee party (sapa) ke jatav-muslim-yadav-jat gathjod ko todgaye ke liye sakriy he
 The party's focus is on non-yadav obcs (other Backward Classes) who together hold 85 per cent stake in obcs
 bhaajapa ne praveen nishad ko kheme man shaamil kar liya he or unhen sant kabir nagar se tikat bhi diya he
 As a joint BSP-SP candidate last year, Nishad defeated BJP in the by-election for Gorakhpur Lok Sabha seat
 brahman-bahul kannauj seat par sapa pramukh akhilesh yadav kii patni dimple ne 2014 main jeet hasil kii thi
 From here this time BJP has fielded Bablu Tiwari, who in 2014 won a lot of votes as a BSP candidate
 pichley do maheenon main sapa, basapa or congress ke kam se kam 50 jila yaa rajya str ke netaa bhaajapa main shaamil hue hai
 Party insiders say that regional and caste imbalances that have remained in the state unit of the party have been removed by including these people
 rajasthan main bhaajapa jat or gurjar netaaon ko apane main mila rahi he taaki anya jatiyon ke apane ummidavaaron ke liye in samudaayon ke logon kaa samarthan jutaya ja sake
 The party needs the support of Jats in Jodhpur from where Union Minister of State for Agriculture Gajendra Singh Shekhawat is contesting the elections and also in Barmer and Nagaur
 lihaaja jat netaa hanuman beniwal kii rashtriya loktantric party ko sahyogi ke rup main le liya gaya he
 Beniwal has previously been with the BJP, now he has been given a ticket from Nagaur
 bhaajapa unki party ke saath talmail kaa phayda jaipur main kendriya soochna or prasaaran mantri rajyavardhan singh rathod ko bhi milane kii ummid kar rahi he jinka muqabla discus-throre athlete krishna punia se he jo khud jat hai
 At the behest of Beniwal, a young Jat leader Kailash Meena has been given a ticket against Manvendra Singh, son of former BJP leader Jaswant Singh from Barmer
 beniwal ke aane se bhaajapa ko shekhavati samet pashchimi rajasthan kii samoochee jat-pattee main madad milane kii ummid he
 Prior to the state assembly elections in November last, due to the efforts of the then Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje, the party tried to mobilize the support of the Meena caste in Jaipur by including Gurjar leader Kirori Lal Meena
 pashchim bengal main bhaajapa ne rajya ke uttari ilaakon main rahane vaale nepali mul ke 11 janajaatiy samoohon ko loksabhaa chunaavon ke baad kanoon banaakar janajaatiy darja dene kaa vaada kiya he
 In addition, three caste-groups — Mathuas, Rajbongshi and Namasundaras, originally from Bangladesh — have been given one seat each, with their respective numbers, but the three together form a strong caste nexus
 iske alaava party gorkhaon, santhal adivaasiyon or chaay bagan shramikon par bhi dhyaan de rahi he
 Kailash Vijayvargiya, bjp's general secretary in-charge of West Bengal, claims that "our access to these communities is based on social justice and this is affecting them
" "gujarat main bhaajapa aarakshan-samarthak netaa hardik patel kii patidaar anamat andolan samiti (paas) ke kaaryakartaaon ko apane main milaane main kaamyaab rahi he
 PASS had damaged the BJP significantly in the 2017 Gujarat assembly elections
 iske alaava, bhaajapa ne kai coli or ahir obisi netaaon ko bhi lubhaaya he
 The BJP hopes that the Modi government has announced 10% reservation in education and employment for the poor people of the upper castes, it will also get the benefit and it will compensate for the anger that the SC / ST (prevention of Atrocities) ) The upper castes boiled over due to steps taken by the government last year to strengthen the law
 tamilnadu main bhaajapa das partiyon ke ek majboot gathjod kaa hissaa he jo tamaam alag-alag jati samoohon kaa pratinidhitiv karata he, jabaki kerala main use nair or ejhava samudaayon ke ek hisse kaa samarthan hasil he or kuch isai samooh bhi uske saath hai

 Chauhan was dilachasp he ki swasthya mantri harshavardhan or paryaavaran mantri prakaash javdekar ne is baithak main hissaa nahin liya
 According to the website of the Ministry of Women and Child Development, animal welfare programs and rabies control are not among the "accepted subjects"
 india today ne is sambandh main jab gandhi se baat kii to unhone kaha ki yah ek anaupchaarik baithak thi jisamen ek ‘‘jaagruk naagarik’’ or saansad ke taur par ve jaananaa chaahati thim ki is payalat kaarykram ko kyon roak diya gaya he
 "I have been associated with this program for some time and wanted to know why it had not been started yet?" She says, "I did not preside over the meeting
" yah sab anaupchaarik tha
 i went there as a Pilibhit MP
 main rebies ke mudde ko lekar chintit hum or isliye is kaarykram se judi hum
 i want to take it to an all India level
 ’’is baithak se sambandhit dastavej saaf bataate hai ki haryana rajya main rashtriya rebies niyantran kaarykram (enarasipi) ke amal ke sambandh main mahila or bal kalyaan mantri menka gandhi kii adhyakshata main 24 june, 2014 ko shastri bhawan main yojit baithak main vichaar kiya gaya or unhone ‘‘haryana main enarasipi ke pashuon se sambandhit kaary kii pragati kii samiksha kii or rahul sahagal (nideshak, asia human socity international) se poocha ki pragati dhimi kyon he?’’gandhi ne daawa kiya he ki baithak main koi faisla nahin kiya gaya
 When he was told that the details of the meeting were clearly recorded regarding the amendment of the expenditure, he said that it was not just him but "all the people" involved in the meeting
 unhone jor dekar kaha, ‘‘main bas itnaa jaananaa chaahati thi ki kaarykram abhi tak kyon shuru nahin kiya gaya
 Rahul Sehgal of HSI said that 650 rupees

 isliye sabhi ne ise sanshodhit karne kaa nirnay liya
 i don't see anything else? Additional expenses involved in creating awareness (at least Rs 1 crore)
 ) ko kendriya swasthya mantralay uthaae
 The details of Gandhi's meeting read that it was decided that "the rate of expenditure on sterilization and vaccination of dogs was Rs 650 respectively
 or 90 ru
 700 instead of Rs
 or 100 ru
 Will be
 ’’is saal april ke shuru main paryaavaran mantralay main enarasipi par yojit pichhali baithak main echesai or world wide veterinary services ke pratinidhiyon ne hissaa liya tha jisamen faisla kiya gaya ki nasbandi or tikaakaran kii dar prati kutta kramshah 650 ru
 And Rs 90
 se adhik nahin honi chahie
 Amendment of expenditure will mean 2
 5 karod ru
 Of additional amount of Rs
 500, whereas it is estimated that only five lakh out of seven lakh stray dogs have been sterilized in Haryana
 baithak main aage faisla kiya gaya ki swasthya mantralay ‘‘kaarykram ko safal banane’’ ke liye echies ko harek jile se atirikt gadibhan / buniyadi suvidhaayen / awaas uplabdh karaane ke liye haryana sarkaar ko likhegaa
 The Ministry of Environment and Health had earlier agreed that at least 70 percent of the dog population in Haryana should be covered under the 12th Plan in the pilot program in the next three years
 edblubiai ne is varsh ke kaarykram main un logon ko shaamil hone ke liye aamantrit kiya tha jo is disha main kaam karne ke icchhuk hai
 Three organizations had expressed their desire

 Where about 12 years ago the government sterilized rate of Rs 445
 par tay kii thi, vahiin kai nikaayon ne kutton kii nasbandi daron main 700-1,200 ru
 Has increased to khabar he ki rebies niyantran ke alaava gandhi paryaavaran mantralay ke pashu kalyaan prabhag main bhi gahari ruchi le rahi hai
 Perhaps they habitually do so
 atal bihari vaajapeyi kii sarkaar ke dauraan samskruti or kaarykram kriyanvayan or sankhyikee mantralayon kaa kaarybhaar sambhalate hue unhone is divijan kaa jimmaa bhi uthaa rakhaa tha
 Gandhi is lobbying to hand over the responsibility of the National Animal Welfare Institute under the Green Ministry to a famous wild life activist
 kendriya paryaavaran mantralay ko apane niyamon ke hawaale se bataanaa padaa tha ki sabhi ko uchit mauka dene ke lihaaj se expressant of intrest aamantrit karnaa hoga jisase sambandhit vyakti yaa enjio ko baraabar kaa mauka mili
 But the Minister for Women and Child Development, Gandhi, denies that he pressurized the institute for any individual
 menka gandhi kii is baithak ne pehle se hi vyavastha or paramparaon ke paalan ko lekar ghiri modi sarkaar ke liye ek nai musiibat khadi kii he
 By the way, one can also see that while the rest of the ministers have to approach the PMO for doing one thing, Maneka is such a minister who is also interfering comfortably in the work of other ministries
 baithak kii khabar aise samay par aa rahi he jab saat baar kii loksabhaa saansad gandhi apane rajnatik prabhaav ko badhaane kii koshish karte hue apane bete loksabhaa saansad varun gandhi ke liye ek majboot jameen taiyaar karne main lagi hai

 The recently increased CNG prices have put CNG car owners in trouble
 kabhi iko friendli ke saath saath pocket friendli maani jane vaali sienji ab keemat ke maamle main dijal ko takkar dene lagi he
 For many people traveling every day in a city like Delhi, CNG made the way easier
 lekin ab sienji kii keemten bhi lagaataar bad rahi hai
 Alam is that the price of CNG in Delhi has reached very close to diesel
 sawaal uthta he ki kya ab bhi sienji jaise saaf eendhan se chalane vaali gaadiyaan har roj safar karne waalon ke liye kifayati hai
 According to Auto Expert Tutu Dhawan, "with the rise in prices, the real motive of CNG is ending
" ab sirf ek hi makasad rah gaya he ki uske saath pradooshan thodaa kam hota he
 In terms of price, CNG is also becoming equal to diesel
 jabaki dijal ke ingine zyada achche hai
 'currently, the price of CNG in Delhi is 50 rupees 10 paise per kg, while diesel costs 54 rupees 34 paise
 noida main to 1 kilogram sienji ke liye 56 rupee 70 paise chukaane padate hai
 Experts believe that even in the case of maintenance, CNG cars are lagging behind diesel-powered cars, from which car companies are busy refining diesel engines further
 aise main sienji se chalane vaali kaaron kii kifayat par sawaal uthanaa laazmi he
 Car companies like Honda have decided to discontinue their only CNG variant, considering the price of CNG and demand for cng-powered cars
 honda cars ke senior vaais president gyaneshwar sen kehete hai, ‘profit kii baat alag he, sabase pehle hamen dekhnaa hoga ki sienji kii keemat jis tarah se bad rahi hai usamen koi demand rahegi bhi yaa nahin
 Our CNG variant was in the previous Honda City, but given the rapid price increase, we have not brought CNG in the new city at the moment
 ’car banane vaali companiyaan to badhati yaa ghatati demand ke saath-saath apane production par brake laga sakati hai, lekin jin logon ne saste vikalp ke taur par sienji kaaren kharid rakhi hai
 They may have to face further increase in CNG prices in the coming times

 gr8 sense of humor @sushmaswaraj akaash bhar sankalpamutthi bhar chuhalsagar bhar udaartaahruday bhar saahasek anjuri kavitadher saare matbhedchutki bhar batakahithodi si mithaibahut se thahakemrityu ko chunautijivan kaa gaanain sabko milaaiye to banati he bhartiyata
 Atal Bihari Vajpayee is formed by mixing them all
 in sabko milaane par hi banataa he vah bharat jise atal ji ne gadha tha
 From Parliament to Road to Race Course to Bank Street as a Sikh journalist tying the news of the Atal era, we never realized that we were reporting history
 kaash ki tab internet hota to ham aaj bhi jaan pate ki atal kii sarkarein raajnneetik saahas kaa anant vistaar thim or yah kisi bhi tarah unki bhavuk kavitaai ke akaash se chota nahin tha
 How much time did Atal have to change the era? Not only six years? Can anyone create or change the era in political leadership of less than a decade? And that too while leading minority governments? Maybe to do so For he has to be adamant courageous
 atal ji kii chah varshiya sarkaron kaa kaal khand bharat main raajnneetik saahas kaa sabase bada yug he
 What unmatched transitions were those, handled with unmatched courage
 bharat ne videsh se judane ke liye daravaaje khole hi the
 At the end of the 1991 crisis, Vajpayee reached out to the President to claim (1996) government
 aarthik udaarikaran kii nai aabhohawaa ke bich parmaanu pareekshan kaa saahas! uske baad antarrashtriya pratibandh!bharat ne pratibandhon ke baavjood duniya ke bazaar main band jari kar 8,700 karod rupee jutaye
 Today we have to believe that nuclear testing created a new brand India in the world
 lekin isamen pokharan ke saahas kii akeli bhoomika nahin thi
 The most aggressive liberalization in the history of India began with the same fervor as Pokhran
 desh ko pehali baar pataa chalaa dhanchaagat sudhaar kya hote hai yani ki desh kaa, arthvyavastha kaa dhaancha kaise badla jaataa he
 Reduction in import duties, invocation of foreign investment, wave of privatization, decrease in government role in economy
 sadakon kaa bananaa, mobile kaa vistaar hamen pataa chalaa lekin usase pehle doorsanchaar kshetra jis kadar vivaadon main ghira tha vah bharat main nijeekaran kaa sabase pehla or sabase bada sankraman tha
 Or to tie the budget deficit in India to the law, lay the foundation of the GST, the formation of independent regulatory bodies such as the Competition Commission
 yah sab shaayad aasaani se yaad nahin aata kyonkipokharanke baad pakistan, kargil, qandahar, agra shikhar baithak kii asafalataa, sansad par hamale jaise sankraman aane vaale the
 Would anyone believe that six years of India's diplomacy, war, terrorism and international transitions were among the biggest transitions in the same period, India achieved the fastest growth rate in the world
 aath fisadi kii vikaas dar kaa vah daur phir nahin lautaa
 Under the leadership of Naman Mohan Singh and not today
 atal ji yah kaise kar sake?sankraman ke un kshanon main vah dhur virdohi dhruvon ke bich nishtha, tevar or vishwaas ke saath dakshin or vam dhruvon ke bich khadey ho gaye the
 On the one hand, he had his own conservative family, that is, the right wing, which was not in favor of foreign investment, friendship with Pakistan and inclusive politics
 jise unhone swayan par haaavee nahin hone diya
 On the other hand, the then strongwomen were irritated by privatization, liberalization and reforms, with the help of which they faced pressure to send troops to Iraq
 atal ji ke netritv main bharat ne jitne sankraman dekhe, sudhaar kaa paravar unase kahin zyada bada tha jinke kaaran aaj bharat ke paas ek nai aadhunik arthvyavastha he
 Atal Ji never took credit for what he did in less than a decade, by remaining unmoved between the two poles
 or jab tak desh unki dein ko samaj paata tab tak vah niraakaar se samvaad main lag gaye the

 bharat main footbal kii shuruyaat 18veen shatabdi ke aakhir ke saalon se maani ja sakati he
 Many new clubs and tournaments started in this period
 lekin bhartiya footbal main asli oochaal us vakt aayaa jab san 1911 main mohan bagan ne east yorkshaire regiment ko 2-1 se haraakar iefe shield kaa khitaab apane naam kiya
 This was the first time an Indian team had won a major national cup
 1888 main shuru hua tha duurand kapasan 1888 main shimla main bharat ke taatkaaleen videsh sachiv mortimer duurand dwaara duurand cap kii shuruuaat kii gai, yah britain ke egge cap or scotland ke scottish cap ke baad duniya kii teesri sabase puraani footbal pratiyogita he
 The first title of this competition started for British soldiers living in India was won by Royal Scout Fusilars defeating Highland Light Infantry
 1893 main tatkaaleen bharat kii rajdhani kalakatta main iefe shield shuru kii gai jo ki vishwa kii chauthi sabase puraani footbal pratiyogita he
 Calcutta later developed into the largest center of football in India
 vishwa ke sabase puraane klbon main se ek he mohan bagan1889 main sthapit mohan bagan bharat kaa sabase purana footbal club he
 However, Mohun Bagan FC was established under the name Mohun Bagan Sporting Club
 1893 main pehali bhartiya federation, indian footbal association kii sthapana hui haalanki isamen ek bhi bhartiya nahin tha
 From 1930, the Indian team started touring Australia, Japan, Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand
 1937 main ol india footbal federation kii sthapana hui
 India's first major international tournament after independence was the 1948 London Olympics in which the barefooted Indian team suffered a 2–1 defeat to France in their first match after a hard struggle
 bharat ke liye match kaa iklauta gol sarangpani raman ne kiya tha, jo ki olympic main bharat kaa pehla antarrashtriya gol bhi he
 The main reason behind India's defeat in that match was to miss two penalty kicks
 iske baad team india ne 1952, 1956, 1960 main bhi olympic main bhaag liya lekin is dauraan team sirf ek match hi jeet pai
 And after 1960, we have never been able to qualify for the Olympics
 AIFF ne mila mauka ganvaiatim india ke paas vishwa patal par apni chhap chhodane kaa sabase bada mauka us vakt aayaa jab san 1950 main brazil main ho rahe fifa world cap main khilne vaale zyaadaatar deshon dwaara naam waapas lene ke kaaran bhartiya footbal team ko world cap main khilne ke liye nyauta mila
 But the governing body of the then AIFF could not understand the importance of that occasion
 AIFF dwaara aane jane kaa paisa nahin hone kii baat kahe jane par fifa yatra kaa adhiktar kharch vahan karne ke liye taiyaar ho gai thi lekin phir AIFF dwaara alag-alag bahaane or fifa vishwa cap se zyada tarjeeh olympic ko diye jane ke kaaran bhartiya team itihaas main naam darj karaane se chook gai
 Excuses do not improve the situation
 People also say that FIFA decided to ban playing barefoot football after the Indian team participated barefoot in the 1948 Olympics, due to which the Indian team refused to play in the World Cup
 Had done it
 haalanki tatkaaleen bhartiya footbal team ke captain shailen manna ke mutabik in khabaron main koi sachai nahin thi balki yah afvaahen AIFF kii galati ko chupaane ke liye udayi gai thim
 Dreaming of playing World Cup may have been anything but the truth is that India have been playing qualifiers continuously since 1985 after missing this opportunity but never even crossed the first stage of the FIFA World Cup qualifier round till the 2014 FIFA World Cup
 Have got
 haalanki fifa vishwacap 2018 ke kwalifire main hamane pehle round main nepal ko haraate huye duusare charan ke liye kwalifai jarur kar liya he lekin vahaan bhi ham lagaataar do match haar chuke hai
 The condition of Indian football in the 1970s, 80s and 90s was very bad though he qualified for the 1984 Asian Cup where he was placed in Group B
 aksar vivaadit rahaa he team chaynis pratiyogita main bharat ek bhi match nahin jeet sakaa haalanki usne ek match drow jarur karaayaa tha lekin sharmnaak baat to yah rahi ki is puri pratiyogita main bharat ek bhi gol nahin kar paaya
 Since this performance of India, many questions were raised on team selection
 80 ke dashak main bhartiya team ne kuch acha pradarshan karte huye 1984 main dhaka or 1987 main kalakatta main huye saf khelon main swarna padak jeeta
 The Indian team has been a big success in South Asia after 6 years, when we won the first SAARC Cup held in Lahore in 1993
 do saal baad colombo main huye saarc khelon main bharat ne doosraa sthaan praapt kiya
 After the SAARC Cup was renamed as SAF Cup in 1997, India won it twice in 1997 and 1999
 iske alaava 2005,09,2011 main bhi bhartiya team ne saf cap jeeta
 But in big tournaments, we are always laggards, whether it is Asia Cup, Olympics or World Cup, we never reach it

 Shail Singh's report appeared in Monday's Economic Times that hacking 70 per cent of India's ATM machines is not a difficult task as all these atms run on Windows XP software, which Microsoft has secured since April 2014

 No major banking fraud has happened in the world till now
 abhi tak ye paisa waapas nahin hua he
 When the bank cannot withdraw its money, how will it give your looted money
 itani aasaani se to nahin degaa
 We tried to go through the ICICI Bank manual to read what the bank promises you in such a situation
 bharat main Banking Codes and Standards Board of India (BCSBI) he, bank iske sadsy hote hai
 Accordingly, ICICI Bank has promised that in case of a fraud, if the bank believes that the mistake is made by him or his staff, the bank will accept its liability and pay the claim
 frod hone par jab branch yaa upabhokta main se kisi kii galati nahin hogi, to ek seemaa tak bank upabhokta ke nuksaan kii bharpai karegaa
 In case of fraud like fund transfer through job racket, lottery or email, the bank will decide if its staff has done so
 aisa sabit hone par bank apana daawa tay karegaa or aapako chukaa degaa
 If the bank made a mistake, then the bank would pay the entire money
 agar upabhokta yaa bank main se kisi kii galati nahin hogi, system main kisi gadabadi se aisa hoga to 5000 rupee tak hi chukaaya jayega
 That too will be such a payment once in the whole life
 agar dobaaraa frod ho gaya to paanch hazaar bhi nahin milegaa
 Online banking is the reality today
 iskaa istemaal badhegaa hi lekin iske khatare bhi utane hi hai
 Now you have to understand that if someone lost your money in a moment, would you be able to take it back in a year
 kya aapako pataa he ki kya-kya karnaa he or police or bank kitni udaartaa se aapaki madad karenge
 The banking code is intended to protect banks or consumers in the event of a fraud
 yah sab nae vishay hai, jinke bare main aapako hi nahin, ham patrakaron ko bhi jaanane-samajhane kii zarurat he
 So today we will talk in 'prime time' that without online banking the fault is more on the accountability of the bank, but in online banking the fault is more on the accountability of the consumer
 aisa kyon he or aapako bachane ke liye kya karnaa chahie
 It is important that when lakhs and billions of people are being brought under the purview of online or internet banking system, they should be alerted on the same scale about security

 Do you know what to do and how generously the police and banks will help you
 banking code kisi frod kii sthiti main bainkon ko bachaane ke liye he yaa upabhokta ko
 These are all new topics, about which not only you, we journalists also need to know
 to aaj ham 'prime time' main yahi baat karenge ki bina online baking main galati kii javabdehi bank par zyada hoti he, lekin online baking main galati kii javabdehi upabhokta par zyada hoti he
 Why is this and what should you do to avoid it
 iske baad bhi ham log chook jate hai
 Somebody calls and tells all his details
 Norton sibar security survey ne bharat ke 1000 upabhoktaaon kaa survey kiya tha
 According to him 34 per cent of Indians are very careless and share passwords with anyone
 unhen lagata he ki online main koi khatara nahin he
 Who will steal my data, but it does not
 kisi kaa bhi data koi bhi chura saktaa he
 Cyber security is the responsibility of the government, the company and the consumer trio
 vaise koi bhi suraksha teenon kii zimmedaari he
 Any company that provides digital banking has Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) 2
 0 praaanpatr hona hi chahie
 In October, 32 lakh debit card information was blown
 state bank of india, echdiefasi bank, isiaisiai, yas bank or exis bank ke card kaa data chori kar liya gaya tha
 There was no such major incident of cyber fraud in the history of India
 tab neshnal pement corporation of india ne bayaan jari kiya tha ki sabhi zaruri kadam uthaa liye gaye hai, graahakon ko chintaa karne kii zarurat nahin he
 The NPCI states that 641 customers of 19 banks have received fraud complaints
 kul milakar 1 karod 30 lakh kii rakam nikaal lee gai he
 These cards have been fraudulent in China and the United States
 zaahir he is khel main luteraa china or america kaa rahaa hoga, wo pakadaa gaya yaa nahin, isaki jaankaree nahin he
 It is not so easy to catch cyber snarls
 bahut se logon ke saath aae din hota rahata he ki unke card se kisi or ne paise nikaal liye hai
 On September 10, our colleague Ravish Ranjan Shukla filed a story that someone cloned in Delhi's Kanjhawala and took away millions of rupees from the ATM
 em di pandey ne kanjhawala ke state bank of patiala ke atm se 10,000 rupee nikaale or usee raat gudgaanv main union bank of india ke atm se 35,000 rupee kisi ne nikaal liya
 He came to know when the message came on his mobile phone at 11 pm
 vahiin ke nivasee sanjay maathur kaa isi tarah se 70 hazaar rupaya nikaal liya gaya
 It took them 15 days to register an FIR
 dilli police se lekar bank ke chakkar lagaate rahe tab exiaar hui
 Two months later, the State Bank of Patiala has received a reply that the people who withdraw money from the ATM of Union Bank of India are not giving complete information
 yani abhi tak log apana paisa hasil nahin kar paae hai
 While lakhs of rupees were extracted from this village by making a clone of the card of half a dozen people
 in logon ne pradhanmantri karyaalay ko patr bhi likhaa tha
 In the era of electronic bank, the reply comes from the email, but it takes months to recover the money stolen
 bahuton ko to paisa miltaa bhi nahin hoga
 Shail Singh's report appeared in Monday's Economic Times that hacking 70 per cent of India's ATM machines is not a difficult task as all these atms run on Windows XP software, which Microsoft has secured since April 2014
 Has stopped doing
 report main atm suvidha uplabdh karaane vaali company ne kaha he ki yah kaam bainkon kaa he ki ve apane software ko apadet karen
 For this reason it has become much easier for hackers to hack your card through these ATM machines
 duniya bhar main atm mashiinon ko paanch saal main badal diya jaataa he
 New software is installed, but they are not replaced in India for ten years
 inhen hataaya bhi jaataa he, to nasht karne kii jagah kisi duusari jagah par laga diya jaataa he
 There is no Microsoft statement in this report, but this report of 'economic Times' forces us to think a lot
 dilli ke shahdara ke lokesh jain ne bhi cashles daur ke maahaul main mobile banking kaa ap down lod kiya, lekin jab ve apane mobile wolet se bijli bill bharne gaye to pataa chalaa ki unke khate se 17,580 rupee gaayab ho chuke hai
 Zero balance was showing in his account
 unhone police se shikaayat kar di he or jaanch chal rahi he
 The comments isi saal farvari main bangladesh ke central bank se 660 karod rupee uda liye gaye
 No major banking fraud has happened in the world till now
 abhi tak ye paisa waapas nahin hua he
 When the bank cannot withdraw its money, how will it give your looted money
 itani aasaani se to nahin degaa
 We tried to go through the ICICI Bank manual to read what the bank promises you in such a situation
 bharat main Banking Codes and Standards Board of India (BCSBI) he, bank iske sadsy hote hai
 Accordingly, ICICI Bank has promised that in case of a fraud, if the bank believes that the mistake is made by him or his staff, the bank will accept its liability and pay the claim
 frod hone par jab branch yaa upabhokta main se kisi kii galati nahin hogi, to ek seemaa tak bank upabhokta ke nuksaan kii bharpai karegaa
 In case of fraud like fund transfer through job racket, lottery or email, the bank will decide if its staff has done so
 aisa sabit hone par bank apana daawa tay karegaa or aapako chukaa degaa
 If the bank made a mistake, then the bank would pay the entire money
 agar upabhokta yaa bank main se kisi kii galati nahin hogi, system main kisi gadabadi se aisa hoga to 5000 rupee tak hi chukaaya jayega
 That too will be such a payment once in the whole life
 agar dobaaraa frod ho gaya to paanch hazaar bhi nahin milegaa
 Online banking is the reality today
 iskaa istemaal badhegaa hi lekin iske khatare bhi utane hi hai
 Now you have to understand that if someone lost your money in a moment, would you be able to take it back in a year
 kya aapako pataa he ki kya-kya karnaa he or police or bank kitni udaartaa se aapaki madad karenge
 The banking code is intended to protect banks or consumers in the event of a fraud
 yah sab nae vishay hai, jinke bare main aapako hi nahin, ham patrakaron ko bhi jaanane-samajhane kii zarurat he
 So today we will talk in 'prime time' that without online banking the fault is more on the accountability of the bank, but in online banking the fault is more on the accountability of the consumer
 aisa kyon he or aapako bachane ke liye kya karnaa chahie
 Then the National Payment Corporation of India issued a statement that all necessary steps have been taken, customers need not worry
 en pi si ai kaa kahana he ki 19 bainkon ke 641 graahakon ke saath dhokhadhadi kii shikaayat ai he
 In all, an amount of 1 crore 30 lakh has been withdrawn
 in card ke saath china or america main frod kiya gaya he
 It is obvious that the robber must have belonged to China and America in this game, whether he was caught or not, it is not known
 itnaa aasaan bhi nahin he sibar jhapatmaron ko pakadana
 There are days when many people have withdrawn money from their cards
 10 sitambar ko hamaare sahyogi raveesh ranjan shukla ne ek story file kii thi ki dilli ke kanjhawala main kisi ne clon banaakar atm se 6 logon ke lakhon rupee nikaal liye
 MD Pandey withdrew Rs 10,000 from the ATM of State Bank of Patiala in Kanjhawala and on the same night someone withdrew Rs 35,000 from the ATM of Union Bank of India in Gurgaon
 inhen tab pataa chalaa jab raat 11 baje inke mobile phone par massej aayaa
 70 thousand rupees were withdrawn from the same resident Sanjay Mathur
 inhen exiaar darj karaane main 15 din lag gaye
 There was an FIR when he kept circling from Delhi Police to the bank
 do maheene baad state bank of patiala se ye jawaab aayaa he ki union bank of india ke jis atm se paisa nikaal gaya wo log puri jaankaree nahin de rahe hai
 That is, people have not been able to get their money yet
 jabaki isi gaanv se aadha darjan logon ke card kaa clon banaakar lakhon rupee nikaal liye gaye the
 These people also wrote letters to the Prime Minister's Office
 electronic bank ke daur main email se jawaab to aa jaataa he magar lutaa gaya paisa waapas lene main maheenon to lag hi jate hai
 Many will not even get money
 somvaar ke hi 'iconomic times' main style singh kii report chhapi he ki bharat ke 70 fisadi atm mashiinon ko hack karnaa koi mushkil kaam nahin he kyonki ye sabhi atm windo eks pi software par chalate hai, jinhen microsoft ne april, 2014 se hi surakshit karnaa band kar diya he
 In the report, the company providing ATM facility has said that it is the job of banks to update their software
 is kaaran haikaron ke liye in atm mashiinon ke zariye aapke card ko hack karnaa kahin zyada aasaan ho gaya he
 ATM machines worldwide are replaced in five years
 nae software laga diye jate hai, lekin bharat main das-das saal tak inhen badla nahin jaataa he
 If they are removed, then instead of destroying, they are put at some other place
 is report main microsoft kaa bayaan nahin he, magar 'iconomic times' kii yah report kaaphi kuch sochane ke liye majaboor karti he
 Lokesh Jain of Shahdara, Delhi, also downloaded the mobile banking app in a cashless round environment, but when he went to pay the electricity bill from his mobile wallet, it was found that Rs 17,580 had disappeared from his account
 unke acount main zero balance dikhaa rahaa tha
 They have complained to the police and investigations are on
 tippaniyan 660 crore was blown from the Central Bank of Bangladesh in February this year
 duniya main ab tak isse bada banking frod nahin hua he
 This money has not been returned yet
 jab bank apana paisa waapas nahin le saktaa he, to aapkaa lutaa gaya paisa kaise degaa
 Will not give so easily
 hamane isiaisiai bank kii niyamavali jaakar padhane kaa prayaas kiya ki aisi sthiti main bank aapse kya vaada karata he
 There is Banking Codes and Standards Board of India (BCSBI) in India, banks are its members
 isi ke anusaar isiaisiai bank ne vaada kiya he ki kisi frod ke maamle main agar bank maan letaa he ki galati uski yaa uske staff kii he to bank apana daayitv sweekaar karegaa or clem chukaayegaa
 When there is no fault of any branch or consumer in case of fraud, the bank will compensate the loss of the consumer to an extent
 job racket, latary yaa email ke zariye fund transfar jaisaa frod hone par bank tay karegaa ki kya uske staff ne aisa kiya he
 On proving this, the bank will settle its claim and repay you
 bank kii galati hoti hogi, to bank puraa paisa chukaayegaa
 If there is no fault of the consumer or the bank, if something happens in the system, then only Rs 5000 will be paid
 wo bhi puure jivan main is tarah kaa bhugtan ek baar hoga
 If it is fraudulent again, it will not be even five thousand
 online baking aaj kii sachai he
 Its use will increase, but its risks are also similar
 ab aapako samajhnaa yah he ki agar aapkaa paisa pal bhar main kisi ne gaayab kar liya to kya aap use saal bhar main bhi waapas le paayenge

 Has the rift between Lalu Yadav's RJD and Nitish Kumar's Janata Dal United deepened in Bihar? This political speculation got a boost when Lalu Yadav responded by tweeting and writing, "lalu Prasad is bent and afraid" Not gonna jab tak aakhri saans he fonsiwadi takaton ke khilaaf ladata rahoonga
 "the matter was fine till now but Lalu Yadav also wrote ahead of it that the BJP should be happy with the new alliance partner
 kya gathbandhan ke nae saathi se unka ishaara is baat se tha ki nitish kumaar bijepi ke kareeb aa rahe hai? jab atakalon kaa bazaar garm hua lalu yadav to saamne nahin aae lekin unki party kii taraf se yah safai di gai ki lalu yadav kaa matlab sibiai or duusari jaanch agenciyon se tha
 But this explanation from the party did not end the matter
 jediu ke netabhi samaj rahe hai ki lalu yadav jaanboojh kar ishaaron-ishaaron main baat kar rahe hai
 When asked about Lalu Yadav's statement, JCU leader KC Tyagi said that we are not looking for a new partner
 lekin, lalu ji ne kis sandarbh main kyon yah baat kahi he isaki vyakhya vah khud kar sakate hai
 We want to complete the age of this alliance by remaining unconfirmed on many occasions
 unhone kaha ki jin paristhitiyon main yah gathbandhan bana tha vah bahut bure din the ghar vaapasi or ashishnutaa kaa daur chal rahaa tha
 But KC Tyagi does not hide that Lalu Yadav and those people are troubled by his color
 unhone kaha ki jediu ke kisi netaa dal united ke kisi bhi kaaryakarta ne aaj taklalu yadavake khilaaf kuch bhi ek shabd bhi nahin kaha
 But we are constantly hearing and tolerating indecent words against our leader
 ke si tyaagi ne kaha kinitish or lalu kaa gathbandhanaise samay par hua tha jab sthiti bahut kharaab thi or ashishnutaa se lekar ghar vaapasi tak kaa bolbalaa tha
 However, when asked about the alliance, KC Tyagi said that JDU will try its best to keep the alliance till its end
 anamarid kapal ko hotel se giraftaar nahin kar sakati pulicenmarid kapal ko apni marji se hotel main thaharne kaa he adhikabgar aap apni garlfriend ke saath kisi hotel main tehre hai or police aapse poochtacha karne aati he, to ghabaraane kii jarurat nahin he
 An unmarried couple staying together in a hotel is not a crime
 lihaaja police ko hotel main tehre kisi anamarid kapal ko pareshaan karne yaa giraftaar karne kaa koi adhikaar nahin hai
 Vinay Kumar Garg, Senior Advocate of the Supreme Court, says that the unmarried couple have the fundamental right to stay in a hotel together and to have a physical relationship by mutual consent
 haalanki iske liye shart yah he ki donon balig hon
 The Supreme Court has clearly stated that the fundamental right found under Article 21 of the Constitution also includes the right to live and make physical relations with anyone at will
 iske liye shaadi ke bandhan main bandhana jaruri nahin he
 This means that if a couple stays together in a hotel without marriage, it is their fundamental right
 senior edwocket vinay kumaar garg kaa kahana he ki agar hotel main thaharne ke dauraan anamarid kapal ko police pareshaan karti he yaa phir giraftaar karti he, to yah unke moulik adhikaron kaa hanan mana jayega
 Against this action of the police, the couple can approach the Supreme Court directly under Article 32 of the Constitution or the High Court directly under Article 226
 senior police adhikariyon se bhi karen shikayatgarg ke mutabik hotel main tehre anamarid kapal ko tang karne vaale pulicekarmi ke khilaaf jile ke police adheekshak yaa usase upar ke police adhikari se bhi shikaayat kii ja sakati he
 Apart from this, the victim couple also has the option to complain to the Human Rights Commission
 ek sawaal ke jawaab main senior edwocket garg ne kaha ki hotel kisi anamarid kapal ko is aadhaar par thaharne se roak nahin saktaa he ki donon shaadishuda nahin hai
 If the hotel does so, it will also be considered a violation of the fundamental right
 iskaa matlab yah hua ki anamarid kapal hotel ke kiraye kaa bhugtan karke aaraam se vahaan thahar sakate hai
 Apart from this, the Hotel Association of India, the apex body of the Indian Hotel Industry, also does not have a rule that prevents unmarried couples from staying at a hotel
 hotel main chhapemari kyon karti he police?police kisi anamarid kapal ko giraftaar karne yaa tang karne ke liye hotel main chhapemari nahin karti he
 Vinay Kumar Garg, Senior Advocate of the Supreme Court, says that prostitution is considered a crime in India
 police aisi veshyavriti ke khilaaf yaa phir kisi apradhi ke chhipe hone kii ashanka par hotel main chhapemari karti he
 If an unmarried couple is staying at the hotel and the police comes to them during the raid, there is no need to panic such a couple
 police kii maang par aise kapal ko apana pahchaan patr yani idi card dikhaanaa hoga, taaki yah sabit ho sake ki donon aapasi sahmati se hotel main tehre hue hai or kisi bhi tarah kii veshyavriti main shaamil nahin hai
 Praveen Khandelwal, president of the Traders Association from Amar Colony Market in Lajpat Nagar, directly targeted all political parties
 unhone chetavanee di ki agar bazaaron main chal rahi ceiling ko roka nahin gaya or sil hui dukaanon ko jald kholaa nahin gaya to vyapaaree dilli main jagah-jagah chakkaa jam karenge
 On the talk of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal sitting on hunger strike from 31st, Pravin Khandelwal clearly said that he is only doing politics on this issue
 agar unki manshaa vyapaariyon ko raahat dene kii hoti to wo dilli vidhansabha main is par bill lekar aate or centre par bhi usko lagu karwaane par jor dete
 Praveen Khandelwal made it clear that he himself is associated with the political party, but on the issue of sealing, all the parties are baking their own political loaves and the businessman is dying unmatched
 unhone ceiling ko avaidh qaraar diya or kaha ki agar vyapaariyon ke liye jald kuch nahin kiya gaya to 13 march ko dilli band ke liye taiyaar ho jaane

 Is this the end of the world? When our politics becomes nationalist and when it is casteist it is related to which state elections are going to be held
 dedh saal pehle loksabhaa chunaavon main van india abhiyaan ke nayak ko ab kyon desh kaa pehla obisi pradhanmantri bataaya ja rahaa he
 After trying to find the caste of Emperor Ashoka in Patna, if you take out the record of caste-based self-respecting conferences held in Bihar in the last one year, then you will know that the parties, regardless of their caste, have the same attitude
 aakhir ek bharat shreshth bharat ke nayak ko in dinon obisi pradhanmantri kyon bataaya ja rahaa he
 There is no one else to tell, BJP national president is Amit Shah
 pichhadaa morcha kii baithak main unhone kaha ki bijepi ne desh main sabase adhik obisi mukhyamantri diye hai
 BJP is also the first OBC Prime Minister of the country
 agar dalit morcha kii bhi baithak hoti to yah bhi bataane kaa mauka miltaa ki kitne dalit mukhyamantri banaae hai lekin khayr unke is bayaan par google se pehle lalu yadav ne bataa diya ki 1996 main janata dal ke rashtriya adhyaksh ke naate unhone hi devegoda ke naam kaa elaan kiya tha
 Deve Gowda of Vokkaliga caste is the first OBC Prime Minister
 devegoda bhi bol rahe hai ki main hum pehla obisi pradhanmantri
 Until Amit Shah refutes the statements of Deve Gowda and Lalu Yadav, the Prime Minister is seen second on the first time due to the statement of the BJP President
 yah bhi kaha jane laga he ki pradhanmantri kii bhi jati kuch saal pehle obisi kii suchi main shaamil kii gai or loksabhaa chunaavon main unhone pehali baar apane bhaashanon main apni jati kaa alag-alag tareeke se istamaal kiya
 Elections were held in Maharashtra, Haryana and Delhi, but after becoming Prime Minister, OBC was not told, what is it in Bihar elections that work is not going on without OBC
 amit shah ne kaha ki sirf bijepi hi pichhadon kaa kalyaan kar sakati he, pichhadi jati ke kalyaan ke liye bane raajnneetik dal apane hi samudaay tak simat kar rah gaye hai
 In the Lok Sabha elections, the Shah and Modi duo not only defeated the OBC leaders of UP Bihar but also pushed the biggest Dalit leader, Mayawati, to zero, but why the same pair is facing allegations that caste based census is not going public

 is par ek dilachasp vishleshan iconomik times main padhaa
 Rajesh Ramachandran has written that when the officers saw that the upper cast in this count is dangerously low, they felt that now even more authentically the question will be raised as to why its participation in the government is the lowest
 Huh
 rajesh kaa anumaan he ki isi ashanka se report dabaai ja rahi he
 Rajesh too has not fully claimed this information in his article, but he has told a math that you can understand this game
 modi cabinet main ekmaatr asardaar becoward cast mantri agar koi he to khud modi hi hai
 The upper cast in his cabinet of 27 members is of the upper cast
 8 cabinet mantri brahman hai or chaar kshatriya hai1 jab sara khel isi par he to khel ke niyam paardarshee tareeke se kyon na tay kiye jaaen
 Is the BJP afraid that after this report, there will be increasing pressure on the government to increase the OBC reservation quota in education and jobs, while a large section of BJP and Sangh Parivar supporters hope that the OBC Prime Minister will abolish the reservation
 vaise bijepi hameshaa hi aarakshan samarthak rahi he
 After all, why are Lalu Yadav and Nitish Kumar stressing the demand to make the caste-based census report public
 lalu yadav ne patna main rajbhavan tak march kiya or kaha ki pradhanmantri modi becoward cast ke dushman hai
 If they are friendly then show the report of caste census in public
 nitish kumaar ne dilli main kaha jab surveykshan karaayaa gaya, gananaa karai gai to uski report aani chahie or logon ko sankhya ke bare main maaloom hona chahie or samaaj ke jo vibhinn samooh hai, unki aarthik sthiti ke bare main, saamaajik sthiti ke bare main jaankaree milani chahie
 Batting on behalf of the BJP, Ram Vilas Paswan said that what will happen tomorrow if it will be published tomorrow
 ham apane samay se karenge, vaise jati kii janaganana kii ek shart yah bhi thi ki ise publish nahin kiya jayega
 Is Paswan right? meri jaankaree main aisi koi shart nahin he ki jati kii janaganana saarvajanik nahin kii jaaegi
 In 2010, there was a lot of debate about caste-based census
 1931 ke baad bhale hi jati kii ginati nahin hui lekin kaha gaya ki 1980 ke mandal kamishan se motaa moti maaloom chal gaya tha ki desh main 54 pratishat obisi hai, 30 pratishat ke aas paas anusuchit jati or janajati or 16 se 18 pratishat apper cast
 If the ratio of upper cast is less than ten percent, then there can be a stir again in Indian politics regarding the question of representation
 us samay kii report ke anusaar arun jetali or sushamaa swaraj jati aadhaarit janaganana ke haq main the
 The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh was not in its favor
 usee tarah se congress main chidambaram, anand sharma virodh main the to virappa moili vyalaar ravi paksh main
 The Left, Mulayam Singh Yadav, Lalu Prasad Yadav and especially Sharad Yadav played a very active role
 tippaniyan On 3 July, when the Government of India released the Socio Economic and Caste Census Report 2011, it showed such a face of rural India that all the claims of development were automatically collapsed
 pataa chalaa ki bharat aaj bhi ek gramin raashtra he
 Out of its twenty five and twenty five crore families, about eighteen crore families live in villages
 lekin jab is survey main anusuchit jati janajati kii sankhya bataa di to baakiyon kii kyon nahin bataai gai
 When BJP can tell the Prime Minister's caste then why not the caste count
 bataane vaale koi or nahin, bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah hai
 In the meeting of Backward Front, he said that BJP has given the highest number of OBC Chief Ministers in the country
 desh kaa pehla obisi pradhanmantri bhi bijepi ne hi diya he
 If the Dalit Morcha had also met, it would have been an opportunity to tell how many Dalits have made the Chief Minister, but on his statement, before Google, Lalu Yadav told that in 1996, as the National President of Janata Dal, he was the name of Deve Gowda Had announced vokkaliga jati ke devegoda hi pehle obisi pradhanmantri hai
 Deve Gowda is also saying that i am the first OBC Prime Minister
 jab tak amit shah devegoda or lalu yadav ke bayaan kaa khandan nahin kar dete tab tak bijepi adhyaksh ke bayaan ke kaaran pehali baar pradhanmantri duusare number par nazar aa rahe hai
 It is also being said that the Prime Minister's caste was included in the list of obcs a few years ago and for the first time in the Lok Sabha elections, he used his caste differently in his speeches
 maharashtra haryana or dilli main chunaav ho gaye lekin pradhanmantri banane ke baad obisi nahin bataaye gaye, bihar ke chunaav main aisa kya he ki bina obisi hue kaam nahin chal rahaa he
 Amit Shah said that only BJP can do welfare of backward, political parties made for the welfare of backward castes have remained confined to their own community
 loksabhaa chunaavon main shah or modi kii jodi ne upi bihar ke obisi netaaon ko na sirf shikast di balki daliton kii sabase badi netaa mayawati ko zero par pahunchaa diya lekin usee jodi par yah aarope kyon lag rahaa he ki jati aadhaarit janaganana kyon saarvajanik nahin ho rahi he
 An interesting analysis on this read in Economic Times
 rajesh ramchandran ne likhaa he ki jab afasaron ne dekha ki is ginati main apper cast khataranaak rup se sankhya main kam hai to unhen laga ki ab to or bhi pramanikta ke saath yah sawaal uthegaa ki jisaki sankhya sabase kam he sarkaar main uski bhagidaari sabase adhik kyon hai
 Rajesh estimates that the report is being suppressed with this fear
 rajesh ne bhi apane lekh main is jaankaree par puri tarah se daawa nahin kiya he lekin unhone ek ganit bataaya he jisase aap is khel ko samaj sakate hai
 The only effective backward cast minister in the Modi cabinet, if any, is Modi himself
 27 sadasyon kii unki cabinet main varchasv apper cast kaa hi he
 8 cabinet ministers are Brahmins and four are Kshatriyas
 1 When the whole game is on it then why not set the rules of the game in a transparent manner
 kya bijepi isliye dar rahi he ki is report ke baad sarkaar par shiksha or naukariyon main obisi aarakshan kota badhaane kaa dabaav badhegaa jabaki bijepi or sangh parivaar ke samarthakon kaa ek bada hissaa yah ummid rakhata he ki obisi pradhanmantri aarakshan samaapt kar denge
 By the way, BJP has always been a supporter of reservation
 aakhir kyon lalu yadav or nitish kumaar jati aadhaarit janaganana kii report saarvajanik karne kii maang par khub jor de rahe hai
 Lalu Yadav marched till Raj Bhavan in Patna and said that Prime Minister Modi is an enemy of the backward cast
 agar ve hitaishi hai to jati janaganana kii report saarvajanik karke dikhaayen
 Nitish Kumar said in Delhi that when the survey was done, the calculation should be done and the people should know about the number and the different groups of the society, about their economic status, social status Should be found

 After all, why are Lalu Yadav and Nitish Kumar stressing the demand to make the caste-based census report public
 lalu yadav ne patna main rajbhavan tak march kiya or kaha ki pradhanmantri modi becoward cast ke dushman hai
 If they are friendly then show the report of caste census in public
 nitish kumaar ne dilli main kaha jab surveykshan karaayaa gaya, gananaa karai gai to uski report aani chahie or logon ko sankhya ke bare main maaloom hona chahie or samaaj ke jo vibhinn samooh hai, unki aarthik sthiti ke bare main, saamaajik sthiti ke bare main jaankaree milani chahie
 Batting on behalf of the BJP, Ram Vilas Paswan said that what will happen tomorrow if it will be published tomorrow
 ham apane samay se karenge, vaise jati kii janaganana kii ek shart yah bhi thi ki ise publish nahin kiya jayega
 Is Paswan right? meri jaankaree main aisi koi shart nahin he ki jati kii janaganana saarvajanik nahin kii jaaegi
 In 2010, there was a lot of debate about caste-based census
 1931 ke baad bhale hi jati kii ginati nahin hui lekin kaha gaya ki 1980 ke mandal kamishan se motaa moti maaloom chal gaya tha ki desh main 54 pratishat obisi hai, 30 pratishat ke aas paas anusuchit jati or janajati or 16 se 18 pratishat apper cast
 If the ratio of upper cast is less than ten percent, then there can be a stir again in Indian politics regarding the question of representation
 us samay kii report ke anusaar arun jetali or sushamaa swaraj jati aadhaarit janaganana ke haq main the
 The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh was not in its favor
 usee tarah se congress main chidambaram, anand sharma virodh main the to virappa moili vyalaar ravi paksh main
 The Left, Mulayam Singh Yadav, Lalu Prasad Yadav and especially Sharad Yadav played a very active role
 tippaniyan On 3 July, when the Government of India released the Socio Economic and Caste Census Report 2011, it showed such a face of rural India that all the claims of development were automatically collapsed
 pataa chalaa ki bharat aaj bhi ek gramin raashtra he
 Out of its twenty five and twenty five crore families, about eighteen crore families live in villages
 lekin jab is survey main anusuchit jati janajati kii sankhya bataa di to baakiyon kii kyon nahin bataai gai
 When BJP can tell the Prime Minister's caste then why not the caste count
 kya paswan sahi bol rahe hai
 There is no condition in my knowledge that the census of caste will not be made public
 2010 main jati aadhaarit janaganana ko lekar kaaphi bahes hui thi
 After 1931, even though caste was not counted, it was said that the 1980 Mandal Commission revealed that there are 54 per cent obcs in the country, around 30 per cent Scheduled Castes and Tribes and 16 to 18 per cent Upper Castes
 agar apper cast kaa anupaat das pratishat se bhi kam hua to pratinidhitiv ke sawaal ko lekar bhartiya raajnneeti main phir se bhuuchaal aa saktaa he
 According to the report at that time, Arun Jaitley and Sushma Swaraj were in favor of caste-based census
 rashtriya swayamsevak sangh iske paksh main nahin tha
 In the same way, Chidambaram, Anand Sharma were in opposition in the Congress and Veerappa Moily Vayalar in favor of Ravi

 pashchim dilli kii punarvaas colony raghubir nagar ke 100 pariwaron main se ek kii sadsy is 67 saal kii mahila ne ek pilot project main hissaa lenaa sweekaar kiya tha jiskaa uddeshy saarvajanik vitaran pranali main amul-chul badlaav laana he
 During 2011, these families received rice, wheat, sugar and kerosene at a fair price shop for Rs 1,000 every month
 ek mahila sadsy ke bank khate main transfar kiye gaye
 This Delhi government project, funded by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), aims to test the feasibility of giving food subsidies directly to people living below the poverty line
 raghubir nagar ke sabhi labhaarthiyon ke paas bipiel (garibi rekha se neeche) card he, iskaa anya uddeshy bhrashtachar ke liye ku khyath saarvajanik vitaran pranali (peedies) ko durust karnaa tha
 The plan is inspired by a scheme operating in South America, especially from Brazil's Bolsa Familia program, which has been very successful
 isi tarah kii 'nakadi transfar' yojana kaa pichley dashak main desh ke anya hisson main bhi pareekshan kiya gaya he, khaskar centre sarkaar ke fund se chalane vaala dhanalakshmi kaarykram jise 2008-09 se aadha darjan se zyada rajyon main lagu kiya gaya he
 Under this, cash is given to such families who take good care of their daughters
 bihar sarkaar kii ek yojana kii bhi kaaphi charchaa hui he jiske tahat haai skool main padhane vaali chaatraon ko cycle kharidne ke liye paisa diya jaataa he
 But this scheme of Raghubir Nagar is the first attempt to give cash in place of PDS items in an urban area
 isamen koi andeh nahin ki desh ke kai hisson main peedies vyavastha ladkadaa rahi he
 Justice D
 constituted to investigate PDS
 pi
 The 2009 report of the Wadhwa Committee states that there is "rampant corruption in it due to grain being sent elsewhere and leakage"
 '' yojana ayog ke anumaan ke mutabik, sabsidi vaala 58 fisadi anaaj vaastavik labhaarthiyon tak nahin pahunchataa
 These residents of Raghubir Nagar also face a similar problem
 sharada begum kii shikaayat he ki unhen kabhi bhi har maah sabsidi vaale 25 kilo khadyann or paanch kilo chini kaa kota nahin mila
 She says, "if we completely depend on reasonably priced ration shops then we will have to eat
" '' ve nakadi transfar yojana se bahut khush hai or chaahati hai ki ise kabhi band na kiya jaae
 Her husband Abdul Jabbar, 71, is ill
 ve kahati hai, ''agar yah yojana jari rahi to ham bazaar se achche kism kaa anaaj or khaane-pine kaa anya saamaan kharid sakate hai
 With the remaining money, i will be able to buy medicines for my husband
 ''anya labhaarthiyon kii bhi aisi hi raay he
 Anjana, a 40-year-old widow nurse who takes care of two children, says, "the time left by this is a relief for me
" '' isi tarah 64 saal kii lila kahati hai, ''isse hamen kaaphi madad mili, lekin raashi 1,500 ru
 Should be per month
 ''kai rajya sarkaron ne puraane lakshya ko hasil karne ke liye apanaae gaye nae tareeke ke phaayde dekhe hai
 Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Ku Maar Modi says, "our success of the cash transfer scheme showed that it leads to a huge reduction in corruption
" '' dilli sarkaar jaldi hi teen or pilot project shuru karne ja rahi he
 Not too short of flaws but this is not the whole picture
 sharada or anjana ke paas kam se kam pakkaa makaan to he, raghubir nagar main hi rahane vaali 35 saal kii reshma jhuggi main rahati hai
 But he was denied the benefit of this scheme
 ve aisi ashanka prakat karti hai jise nakadi transfar kaa virodh karne vaale yojanakaar or saamaajik kaaryakarta akasar jaahir karte rahe hai
 She says, "the money it will get will be spent on other things than food
" hamen nakadi nahin chahie
 Jagdish Bharti, a local resident, says, "the men will sip this money and put Daru in drinking and gambling
" aurat kuch khaas nahin kar saktin
 Children will remain hungry
 '' isaki bhi ashanka he ki agar paisa nahin badhaayaa gaya to mahangaai ke daur main puraa rashan nahin le paaenge
 If cash transfer is implemented in place of PDS then it will also have huge implications for the country's economy
 dashakon se chali aa rahi peedies kaa kya hoga? or sarkaar har saal kharide jane vaale khadyann ke pahaad kaa kya karegi? udhaaharan ke liye saal 2011-12 main 2
 83 million tonnes of wheat were procured, of which 80 per cent was distributed through PDS

 Thomas says, "personally, i am not in favor of cash transfer if not as a minister

 Says Swaminathan, "farmers will be affected by eliminating PDS or replacing cash with grain
" ham ship tu mouth (jahaaj se upabhokta tak) kii vyavastha ko waapas laaenge, aayaat par nirbhar ho jaaenge
 He said that this would also kill investment in infrastructure like storage after farming
 shaayad nakadi transfar or paramparaagat peedies kaa mishran hi sabase acha samaadhaan ho saktaa he
 As seen in Tamil Nadu and Chhattisgarh, the PDS can be improved and it can be run effectively if desired

 aam chunaav kii tazaa khabaron se apadet rahane ke liesbscribakaren ajtak kaa ellection special news letters Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh Yogi Adityanath has visited Ayodhya on Wednesday, just 24 hours after the charges against the leaders of LK Advani, Murali Manohar Joshi and Uma Bharti in the Babri demolition case
 kareeb do maheene pehle mukhyamantri banane ke baad siem yogi kaa yah pehla ayodhya daura he
 After reaching there, he first saw Hanumangarhi and worshiped
 iske baad vah ramalala ke darshan karne gaye
 From there went to Achaman on the banks of river Saryu and inspected the ghats there
 tippaniyan Though he was scheduled to go to Ayodhya after taking oath of the Chief Minister's post, but the political implications of the sudden decision to leave there soon after the charges were framed on the senior leaders of the BJP in the Babri demolition case are being removed
 yah isliye bhi ahm he kyonki court main sunwaayee ke liye hajir hone ke liye pahunche bijepi ke in varisht netaaon se siem yogi adityanath ne mulaakaat bhi kii thi
 In fact, according to experts, through this visit of CM Yogi, it seems that the BJP wants to give the message that the Ram temple issue is still important for him and he is included in his agenda
 vajah chaahe jo bhi ho lekin is yatra kii timming ne siyaasi khalabali jarur machaa di he
 For the first time in 15 years, tremendous security arrangements have been made in Faizabad district in view of the Chief Minister's visit to Ayodhya
 isse pehle 2002 main tatkaaleen mukhyamantri rajnath singh ayodhya gaye the
 CM Yogi will be in Ayodhya for almost nine hours and he will be Dr
 ram manohar lohia avadh vishvavidhyalay main party ke padaadhikariyon se vichaar-vimarsh bhi karenge
 Apart from this, a review meeting will be held with administrative officials and in the evening Mahant Nritya will participate in the birth anniversary program of Gopaldas
 vaise party kii taraf se yah kaha ja rahaa he ki mahant nrity gopaldaas ke janmotsav kaarykram main unako pehle hi aamantrit kiya gaya tha or unka vahaan jane kaa pehle se hi kaarykram tha
 Therefore, the political implications of this visit should not be removed as it is a mere coincidence that the very next day of hearing of the Babri case, Mahanta dance Gopaldas had his birthday
 vaise mukhyamantri pad kii shapath lene ke baad unka ayodhya janaa tay tha lekin babari vidhwans cese main bijepi ke varisht netaaon par aarope tay hone ke tatkaal baad vahaan achaanak jane ke faisle ke siyaasi nihitarth nikaale ja rahe hai
 This is also important because CM Yogi Adityanath had also met these senior BJP leaders who had come to the court for the hearing
 darasal jaankaron ke mutabik siem yogi kii is yatra ke jariye aisa lagata he ki bijepi yah sandesh dena chaahati he ki ram mandir kaa mudda uske liye abhi bhi ahm he or vah uske agenda main shaamil he
 Whatever the reason may be, but the timing of this journey has created political turmoil
 15 saalon main pehali baar pradesh ke mukhyamantri ke ayodhya daure ko dekhte hue faijabad jile main jabardast suraksha intjaam kiye gaye hai
 Earlier in 2002, the then Chief Minister Rajnath Singh visited Ayodhya
 siem yogi takreeban nau ghante ayodhya main rahenge or vah dow
 Ram Manohar Lohia will also hold discussions with party officials at Awadh University
 iske alaava prashasnic adhikariyon sang samiksha baithak karenge or shaam ko mahant nrity gopaldaas ke janmotsav kaarykram main shaamil honge
 By the way, it is being said from the party that he was already invited to the Mahant dance Gopaldas' birthday celebrations and he was already scheduled to go there
 isliye is daure ke siyaasi nihitarth nahin nikaale jane chahie kyonki yah mahaj ittefaq he ki babari cese kii sunwaayee ke agle hi din mahant nrity gopaldaas kaa janmdin pad gaya
 For the first time in 15 years, tremendous security arrangements have been made in Faizabad district in view of the Chief Minister's visit to Ayodhya
 isse pehle 2002 main tatkaaleen mukhyamantri rajnath singh ayodhya gaye the

 unhone kaha ki mujhe khilji ko dekhakar yaad aayaa ki kaise ajam khan ne chunaav ke dauraan mujhe pareshaan kiya tha
 In fact, Jaya is considered close to Prada Amar Singh and their dispute with Azam Khan is long
 isaki vajah jaya pradaa kaa ajam khan ke grihnagar rampur se chunaav ladanaa rahaa he
 In the 2004 Lok Sabha elections, the Samajwadi Party gave Jaya Prada a ticket and she won the election

 The Indian team, which suffered a shocking defeat at the hands of Korea in their first match in Group A, did not look back after that and won all the matches unilaterally and went on to the final
 thai team group-bi main pehle sthaan par rahi thi
 It was expected that it will give a lot of competition to India but it could not be seen even in the match
 bhartiya khilaadiyon ne chah baar thai team ko alout kiya
 The Thai players looked helpless in front of the experienced players of India but it will not happen in the final
 iran ne hameshaa hi bharat ko kadi takkar di he
 Who can forget the final of the 2014 Asian Games, where India won closely after the final raid, 27-25
 isi tarah bharat ne 2010 ke asian khelon main bhi iran ko hi haraaya tha
 Indian captain Anoop Kumar said in a press conference after the match with Thailand, 'we have already prepared for the final
 iran yaa phir korea koi bhi final main pahunchataa, ham uske khilaaf ek tarah kii ranneeti ke saath mat par utarate
 Our goal is the World Cup and we are very close to it
 ham ab koi chook nahin karnaa chahenge
 Due to Pakistan's absence and Bangladesh's poor game in this World Cup, Iran remained the second-biggest contender for the title, proving it to be the final
 tippaniyan Iran, who lost against a weak team like Poland at the group level, however had a tough fight with Korea in the semi-finals
 korian team sahi myne main ek semifinlist kii tarah kheli or yah jataa diya ki aane vaale samay main vah kabddi kii shakti ke rup main ubharegi
 Regarding the final match, Iranian captain Miraj Sheikh said, 'we are ready

 When Rahul Gandhi blew the Congress election bugle from Deoria on September 6, he hardly realized that his farmer journey would end like this
 congress upaadhyaksh ne 24 dinon main 3438 kilometre kaa faasla napa 26 road sho or 26 khaat sabhaayen kii, mandir ,masjid, dargah, girjaghar or gurudwara sab darbaron par dastak di
 He will always fill his bag with a thought
 magar kisaan yatra ke aakhri din rahul gandhi ke pichley chaar hafton kii mehnat par pani phir gaya
 Congress supporters clashed with each other in the morning, Rahul's Kisan Yatra was moving from Kushal Mangal Meerut to Delhi
 shaam ko 5 baje dilli ke bhairav mandir par congress ke samarthakon kaa gut aapas main bhid pade
 Actually, different states have been given the responsibility of different places for Rahul's visit
 bhairav mandir ke baahar morcha haryana congress ke jimme tha
 How did the quarrel begin? From the afternoon, a crowd of workers started coming to the Bhairav temple
 pichhali kai baar kii hi tarah pradesh adhyaksh ashok tavar or purv mukhyamantri bhupendra hooda ke samarthak aamane-saamne narebaaji karne lage
 Actually, the quarrel between the supporters of Tanwar and Huda has already made headlines
 magar dekhte hi dekhte narebaaji dhakka mukki main tabdeel ho gai or donon hi partiyon ke bich danda chalane lage
 Who killed the lathi? If Rahul Gandhi saw this picture, he might not believe it either
 vipakshi partiyon ke samarthak to pehle bhi haath do chaar karte aae hai
 But the lathi that went on between the supporters of Huda and Tanwar does not suit the supporters of the country's oldest political party
 poster ko lekar shuru hui bahes haathaa pai main badal gai
 In fact, Tanwar's supporters say that the people of Hooda also made a poster of their leader, Pahad and Badamji
 bade netaa tamaasha dekhte rahehairat kii baat ye hai ki maukey par maujuud vidhayak or netaa tamashbin bane rahe
 The show lasted for some 15 minutes
 bataaya ja rahaa he kii ashok tanvar samet darjan bhar kaaryakartaaon ko aaramail aspataal le jaaya gaya
 But when asked about Bhupendra Hooda's son Deepender Hooda who was standing outside the barricade during the incident, he said that he has no information about it
 yah or baat thi ki congress ke aapasi ladaai sadakon par aa gai par kuch kadam dur khadey deepender huda ko najar nahin ai
 Ashok Tanwar gets hurt on his head, angry with Rahul Gandhi Hooda
 unhen or duusare chotil kaaryakartaaon ko ilaaj ke liye aaramail aspataal bheja diya gaya
 When Rahul Bhairav reached the temple, he could not see Ashok Tanwar
 darasal rahul tak pehle hi ye khabar pahunch chuki thi
 In such a situation, the Congress Vice President met the workers for just two minutes and left
 lathi lagane se tanvar ke sar par taanke lage or jaanch abhi chal rahi he
 According to sources, Rahul Gandhi is angry with this incident
 sonia ko bhi is ladaai ke bare main bataaya gaya jise sun kar wo kaaphi pareshaan huin
 The protest of Tanwar supporters in the Congress office is evidently due to the fact that the party clashed in two knees of the party
 congress netaa kamalnath, digvivijay, aaazaad or motilal vora ne congress daftar main is masale par emergency meeting lee
 At the same time, supporters of Ashok Tanwar sat on a dharna in the Congress office
 unki maang he ki bhupinder huda par karrwai ho
 Just before Rahul Gandhi's arrival, all the common swords between the two leaders in the party are drawn

 The opposition became angry with the government that after the Prime Minister's speech, the Opposition leaders were not given a chance to ask for clarification
 rajyasabha main aisi parampara he ki pradhanmantri yaa sadan ke netaa ke bhaashan ke baad vipaksh sawaal puch saktaa he, aisa niyam loksabhaa main nahin he
 But when the Opposition was not given this right, CPM leader Sitaram Yechury stuck to his amendment
 sanshodhan kaale dhan ko lekar tha jisamen kaha gaya he ki raashtrapati ke abhibhaashan main yah bhi joda jaae ki sarkaar kaledhan ko vaapis laane main vifal rahi he
 Yechury demanded a division of opinion on this which had to be accepted under the rule
 haalanki sansadeey kaarymantri ne venkaiya naidu ne yah jarur samajhane kii koshish kii ki niyam ke tahat mat vibhaajan nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Venkaiah Naidu had the idea that the majority did not have a government, then the electronic machine voting took place and only 57 votes were cast in favor of the government and 118 in protest
 gauratlab he ki rajyasabha main endie ke saansadon kii sankhya 72 he yani endie ke saare saansad rajyasabha main maujuud nahin the
 Earlier this happened in 2001 when the government lost in this house
 vipaksh kii isi ekta kii vajah se sarkaar ko pichley dinon teen bilon ko vaapis nahin lene diya gaya sadan se or sarkaar bhoomi adhigrahan or anya bilon ke liye rajyasabha or loksabhaa kaa jwanit seshan bulaane par vichaar kar rahi he
