 unke anusaar, '23 aktubar ko ibi ne bihar police ko khaastaur par chetavanee di ki narendra modi kii patna raily ko indian mujahidin ke aatanki nishaanaa bana sakate hai

 Raju Khan says that what will he do now, go to the bank and get the money in his account and give it by check
 aspataal ne check lene se manaa nahi kiya tha or lautaaya bhi nahin tha
 Payments will have to be made by check, as people are worried about not taking 500 and thousand rupee notes in private hospitals of Jaipur
 jinke paas paise nahin he un marijon se aspataal check ke jarie paise dene ke liye kah rahe hai
 Hospitals say that taking 500 and 1000 rupees after the government's refusal is a legal offense

 Such a rule should be applied in future, beyond which there will be 2 children, they will be deprived of the right to vote

 Senior students admitted to MBBS first year, allowing students to enter the college on the first day by shaving their heads and bowing their heads
 itnaa hi nahin ne ladakiyon ko baalo main tel lagaakar or juda banaakar aane kaa farmaan sunaaya gaya tha
 Following the orders of the seniors, these students turned heads on the first day and came to college, and many girls came tied up
 bataa den ki is raging kii complaint kisi chaatr ne aupchaarik taur par nahin kii lekin media main tasviir ke viral hone ke baadilahabaddm ne khud se sangyaan liya or jaanch ke aadesh de die
 The matter came up for discussion on Thursday when a picture of dozens of students shaved heads went viral, all of them entering a row together at Motilal nehrumedical College in Allahabad
 medical college ke senior chaatro par aarope laga he ki vah junior chaatro kii raging karte hai
 The senior students shaved the heads of many junior students and told the students that the students would come to the college by applying oil and hair
 ab ye peedit chaatr naa to kisi se apni baat kah rahe he naa kisi se shikaayat
 After this ragging came to light, the DM has ordered an inquiry into it
 is sambandh main camere par na to koi chaatr kuch bol rahaa he or naa hi college prashasan
 However, after getting the information from Allahabad District Officer Suhas LY, an inquiry committee has been prepared and ordered an inquiry
 jila adhikari ne bataaya ki is sambandh main jaise hi jaankaree mili he
 a team has been constituted to investigate the entire matter, in which the leadership of the SDM will investigate the matter along with the CO of the concerned area and some other officials of the administration
 jiladhikari ne yah bhi bataaya ki philhal yah puri jimmedaari college prashasan kii hoti he lekin unki taraf se abhi tak is prakaran main koi shikaayat nahin kii gai he
 That is why, taking cognizance of themselves, a team has been formed for investigation

 However, on the question of terror, Imran struck a rant
 hafiz said par karrwai ke sawaal par imran ne kaha ki ham bharat ke hukum par kisi ko bhi nahin pakad sakate

 bharat or pakistan main ho rahi baatcheet kii nai koshishon par
 
 koi nahin kah saktaa ki ye baatcheet kahaan tak jaaegi
 Even before the matter has progressed, but then something happens
 main dua karuunga ki donon deshon main aapasi sambandh behatar hon
 It is the responsibility of both sides to take the conversation forward
 unka vijan hi tay karegi ki baatcheet kitni aage badhegi
 Whenever India extended the hand of friendship, the shells went from there
 
 
 yahaan ho saktaa he log aisa sochate hon lekin pakistan main yah mana jaataa he ki jab tak kashmir par baat nahin hoti or uskaa hal nahin nikalataa tab tak shanti sthapit nahin ho sakati
 The order of dialogue during the Manmohan period should be increased? There are a small number of people in both countries who do not want to improve relations between the two countries
 lekin awam dono taraf behatar relation chaahati he
 All this is a lack of leadership
 baatcheet ke dauraan thodi baadha ho jaati he to puri prakriya ruk jaae yah kahaan kii samajhadaari he
 Instead of putting a check on Pak terrorism, why does Kashmir harbor rage? Terrorism is also an issue related to Kashmir

 Negotiations can be successful if the leaders of both sides are able to convince their people that the two countries will progress by improving relations
 garibi khatm karne ke liye bhi jaruri he ki donon deshon ke bich vyapaar shuru ho
 India has given Pakistan the status of Most Favored Nation but the attitude of the neighbor is reversing
 See different perceptions on both sides of the border
 donon deshon ke netaaon ko chupchaap milane kii jarurat kya he

 After that barbaric terrorist attack at the Army School in Peshawar last year, he has opened a front against all the terrorists without any discrimination
 halaat ab kaaphi behatar hue hai
 People like Hafiz Saeed are spewing fire against India every day, many terrorist organizations are living in Pakistan and waging war against India, there is no action against them? We cannot arrest anyone on the orders of India
 agar kisi ko apradhi sabit karnaa he to uske liye saboot pesh karnaa hoga
 Sharif took action for the first time on those whom no one laid his hands on
 main agar pradhanmantri hota to unase baat karata ki dekhie desh main jis kism kii garibi he aise main hamen vyapaar badhaane par jor dena chahie
 As far as Hafiz Saeed is concerned, look at the evidence to be collected against someone before arresting him

 bachapan se hi maine hameshaa apane papa ke saath zyada confort or bonding mahasoos kii
 It was not that Mummy did not love me but the heart connection she had with Papa could never be made with Mummy
 haa kah sakate hai ki betiyon kaa judaav pita ke saath zyada hota he
 Papa, a word that probably has all the power of the world, who has the answer to every confusion of his child, who maintains his happiness by fighting every problem in the world
 maine bachapan se kabhi bhi aisa mahasoos nahin kiya ki papa se kuch kahuungi to daant padegi
 My father always walked with me and i can say that he supported me in every way to make my journey happy
 aaj jab main shaadi ke laayak ho gai hum (jaisaa ki socity ko lagata he) to meri kasuti par koi khara hi nahin utarataa
 i don't know why this is so, but i just want that my partner will be like my father, sensible, caring and will stand with me in all my good and bad
 shaadi ke maamle main bhi papa ne mujhe kabhi bhi kuch nahin kaha bas itnaa ki tumhen jo acha lage tum wo karo
 It feels good not to be so friendly with Papa
 par shaayad kai logon ko meri ye baaten filmi lag sakati hai kyonkihar kisi ne papa kaa aisa rupanhin dekha hota
 The image of a strong mood, punctual and silent father will still be seen in a large part of our society
 papa kaa aisa swabhaav kyon hua ye jaanane kii kisi ne koshish nahin kii par haa unke is vyavhaar par sawaal sabane uthaa die
 Every father is full of love like a mother's heart full of love, we are not the only ones who try to touch that soft feeling
 aaie jaane, papa ke saath kaise banaaen apane rishte ko majboot or dostana
 
 
 1
 papa ke saath khub samay bithaayenmain jab choti thi to papa ke offis se aane kaa intjaar besarbi karti thi jaise ki har baccha karata he or unke aate hi dhamachaukadi machaane lagati thi
 Every moment spent with my father is the best moment of my life
 agar aapke papa thode shant or kadak hai to unke saath khub samay bitaayen or unhen unkimaujuudagi kaa ehsaas dilaaein
 Believe you will soon feel a change in your relationship with them
 2
 Talk to everyone, share them with me
 i do not remember any such incident when i shared a secret with my mother, because i loved to say my words gently in my father's ear
 papa ke saath jab apni ulajhane bantna shuru kiya to jindagi hameshaa sulajhi hui si lagi
 My father became my best friend forever
 isliye aap bhi apane papa ko apni diary bana len jahaan par aapkaa likhaa har lafj mahfus rahegaa
 Talk with them about their Struggle days
 Believe the truth, you will get to learn the biggest lation in your life
 3
 Make them feel that they are special
 i think it is the hardest thing in the world to tell Papa that i love or love you very much
 aisa isliye hota he kyonki hamane papa ke saath aisa confortjone banaaya hi nahin ki unase pyaar bhari baaten kar saken yaa unke khaas hone kaa ehsaas kara saken
 Therefore, now from the beginning, on every special occasion or without any talk, it will make Papa realize that he is special
 inhen kuch baton ko dhyaan main rakhkar agar ham jindagi ke sabase khaas rishte ko sambhalakar chalem to papa se kuch bhi kahana aasaan ho jayega
 Because nothing is more important to a father than the happiness of his children
 aise hi kuch video yahaan dekhen jo Father's Day par soshal media par khub viral ho rahe hai
 Because every father has a hero hidden in him and real life heroes are there

 Sindoor has great importance in common life and in religious works
 sindur mukhyatah naarangi rang kaa hota he, mahilaayein ise saubhaahgya or shringaar ke liye prayog karti hai
 Marriage without vermilion cannot be imagined
 sindur ko mangal grah se bhi jodakar dekha jaataa he, isiilie ye mangalakaari bhi hota he
 It is considered auspicious to offer vermilion to Lord Hanuman
 hanuman ji ne ek baar sita mata se prerit hokar sindur laga liya tha
 Since then it is considered auspicious to offer vermilion
 hanuman ji ko sindur arpit karne ke niyam kya hai ?- hanuman ji ko prasann karne ke liye mangalvaar ko sindur arpit karnaa chahie
 - If Mars is obstructing or there is a particular crisis, then Hanuman ji should offer jasmine oil and vermilion
 - purush hanuman ji ko sindur arpit bhi kar sakate hai or lepan bhi
 - But women should not offer vermilion
 agar baar baar naukari chhot jaati ho yaa badalani padati ho, to sindur kaa kaise karen prayog ?- kisi bhi mangalvaar ko hanuman ji ke charnon kaa sindur laayen- ek safed kagaz par us sindur se swastik banaaye- is kagaz ko apane paas rakkhen- aapaki naukari kii har samasya dur hogi
 Use of vermilion to get rid of debt- Mix vermilion in jasmine oil- Take as many peepal leaves as you are old- Write "ram" on every leaf- Offer Hanuman ji on Tuesday - You will get freedom from debt Use of vermilion for happiness in life- Offer vermilion to Maa Gauri after bathing every morning- Then apply vermilion to yourself- Pray for a happy couple- Only women will use punjab neshnal bank ko kul 1,132 shakhaon main centre kholane hai jabaki usne ab tak isaki shuruyaat bhi nahin kii he

 ) ek pakhwada pehle 20 janvari ko rashtriya janata dal (argedy) ke netaa lalu prasad yadav ne elaan kiya tha ki jithan ram maanjhi bihar ke mukhyamantri bane rahenge
 He put an end to the speculation that this Mahadalit leader would be removed soon from the state power summit
 lekin ab lalu kaa rukh badal chukaa he
 They are saying that whether or not Manjhi remains the Chief Minister is an internal matter of JDU and hence Nitish Kumar will decide it and that decision has been taken
 kya he kahanirajya main netritv parivartan ke bare main anaupchaarik charchaaon ke bich maanjhi ko lekar lalu ke rukh main aayaa badlaav sabase pukhta sanket tha ki mukhyamantri ke bataur maanjhi ke kaarykaal par jald hi paradaa gir saktaa tha
 Lalu had a separate conversation with JDU President Sharad Yadav in Delhi last week
 isi baatcheet ko unke rukh main aae badlaav kii vajah bataaya ja rahaa he
 Sharad is understood to have told Lalu that the possibility of a coalition in the october-november assembly elections would be lost if Manjhi remained the Chief Minister
 lalu ne jis tarah dhire-se maanjhi kii peeth se apana haath hataaya he, usase is baat kaa bhi ishaara miltaa he ki rajya ke samaajawaadee gathbandhan main kya kuch chal rahaa he or chijen kidar ja rahi hai
 Lalu had only two options: either let him be a soft Manjhi by nature and stay at the summit for six months and not have any hope of returning to power after the election or make free-thinking Nitish Kumar the Chief Minister, Establish good governance and then hope to return to power by winning elections
 sarkaar kii bagdor kuch or vakt maanjhi ke haathon main saunpe rakhane kaa arth rajya main lalu-nitish gathbandhan ke liye aage ke raaston ko band karnaa ho saktaa tha
 Keeping an eye on the election, Lalu decided to try the better prospects
 bane rahane kii kavayadbijapi ke hamale se apni khisakati hui siyaasi jameen ko bachaane ke liye nitish or lalu donon ab ek-duusare par nirbhar hai
 In June 2013, after the relationship with the BJP broke down, the JDU government was able to survive by defending the rebellion of the rebels, it was possible only with the support of Lalu
 isi tarah 2005 ke vidhansabha chunaavon ke baad lagaataar paanch chunaav haarane ke baavjood lalu agar apane siyaasi bhavishya ko lekar bharosemand hai, to yah nitish kumaar ke sahyog ke boote hi he
 This has kept Lalu's hopes of returning to the political center of the state alive
 maanjhi ko mukhyamantri banaate vakt yah tay kiya gaya tha ki ve vidhansabha chunaavon tak pad par bane rahenge, par chunaav nitish ke netritv main hi ladaa jayega
 But when it was believed that Manjhi could not give good governance and there was growing uneasiness within the party over it, JDU decided to change its strategy
 bijepi kii aakraamak badhat kaa muqabla kar rahi party koi jokhim nahin lenaa chaahati
 a JDU minister says, "if the next election is to be fought under Nitish's leadership, it is better to replace Manjhi
" ashanka jarur he ki maanjhi ko hataane par mahadalit voton kaa ek hissaa jediu ke khilaaf ja saktaa he
 The BJP will not be deterred by baking its bread
 vah maanjhi ko utpeedit mahadalit netaa ke taur par khadaa karne kii koshish kar sakati he
 'there was a lot of doubt in some parts of RJD and JDU about the political intentions of Manjhi
 jab nitish-lalu apane jhagadon ko dafna bhavishya kii ranneeti banane main lage the, tab maanjhi kabhi narendra modi kii tarif karke or kabhi rajya main dalit ko mukhyamantri banane kii pairvi karke gathbandhan main bechaini paidaa kar rahe the
 Though JDU leaders did not question the argument of the Dalit Chief Minister, Lalu rejected Manjhi's saying that only the public will decide who will be the next Chief Minister? It was already done after Faisal Laloo was taken into confidence
 JDU obviously wants a very smooth and smooth leadership change
 party sutron ke mutabik sharad yadav shaayad maanjhi se pehle hi baat kar chuke the ki ve nitish ko mukhyamantri banane ke liye pad se hat jaaen
 Manjhi met Sharad on 4 February
 haalanki vaikalpik yojana ke taur par donon partiyon ke netaa maanjhi ke bagawati rukh akhriyaar karne kii haalat main sambhavit nuksaan kaa andaaj lagane kii koshish kar rahe the
 Manjhi, however, did not appear ready to give up his post by accepting the leadership
 unke samarthak nitish samarthakon ko is baat ke liye doshi tehraate hai ki ve vidhansabha chunaavon tak maanjhi ko sarkaar chalaane dene ke vaade se mukar rahe hai
 On 4 February, when Nitish addressed the Lok Sabha candidates of the party at his residence, Manjhi did not attend that meeting
 maanjhi ne gaya se loksabhaa chunaav ladaa tha or haar gaye the
 As a result, he was also expected to be present in that meeting
 jaahir taur par vahaan na jaakar unhone apana virodh hi pradarshit kiya
 JDU state president Basistha Narayan Singh recently said that everything is not going well between Manjhi and his ministers
 unhone yah salaah bhi di thi ki maanjhi ko apane mantrimandal ke saathiyon ke saath sulah kaayam kerani chahie
 This was an indication that while evaluating his government, the party considers Manjhi's fault
 narayan ke bayaan ke ek din pehle hi maanjhi ne kaha tha ki ve khud apane cabinet mantri lalan singh ke kaamkaaj se santusht nahin hai
 For this reason, he also talked about transferring the secretary of the Road Construction Department
 isse pehle do mantriyon lalan singh or pi
 K
 shahi ne mukhya sachiv ko chitthee likhakar iees afasaron ke tabadale ke tareeke par sawaal uthaae the
 Even after this letter, Manjhi's stubborn attitude did not change and he argued that he had every right to transfer the officers
 maanjhi kii sarkaar main daraar or gahari ho gai thi
 Many ministers were not hesitating to register a protest against the Chief Minister
 mukhyamantri ke ganatantr diwas milan samaaroh main keval chaar mantri pahunche
 Earlier, Food and Consumer Protection Minister Shyam Rajak had invited Manjhi and his loyalists to only ministers close to Nitish at the feast on his behalf
 janvari main jab maanjhi sahakaarita mantri jai kumaar singh kii daavat main shaamil hue, tab unke kareeb darjan bhar mantri alag kamare main baithe rahe or maanjhi ke saath dua-salaam ke liye baahar tak nahin aae the
 An insider of the party said a few days ago, "when every party official requests Nitish to return as Chief Minister, he just smiles
" ' jediu adhyaksh sharad yadav bhi nitish ke nivas par hui baithak main maujuud the
 He too refused to say anything about Manjhi's future, saying, 'this is a useless question, i have nothing to say
 ' jab unhone yah baat kahi thi, shaayad us samay tak faisla liya ja chukaa tha! The rhetoric is in full swing
 koi kah rahaa he ki sabko hindu bana do, to koi kah rahaa he ki logon kii paidaaish musalmaan ke rup main hi hoti he
 The process was not stopping
 ulate donon ore jehar ugal rahe netaaon kii sabhaaon main bheed badhati ja rahi he
 But the concern is about the Muslim community
 bayanon se upje vivaad sabase zyada nuksaan isi kaum ko pahunchaate rahe hai or pahunchane ja rahe hai
 Now a look at Muslim leadership
 muslim netritv isliye kahana pad rahaa he, kyonki har muslim netaa kii tarakkee kii pehali seedhi uskaa majahab hi hoti he
 And the party he is in has moved forward by assuring him that he will get the votes of Muslims
 muslim vot bank
 No Hindu leader could give such a guarantee
 sadhu-sant bhi nahin
 Because nobody listens to them
 is politics ke itar jo sabase zyada gambhir baat muslim kaum ke saath judi he, vah kattarpanth or jahaalat
 Just 3 over 20 years old
 6 fisadi muslim hi graduate hai
 While the nationwide average of 6
 7 pratishat he
 Muslim women are the most illiterate among women of any other religion
 har do main se ek mahila anpadh he
 Not only this, there is a big problem of Muslims in the country
 aazaadee ke baad se yah lagaataar badhati rahi, jabaki hinduon kii ghatati rahi
 Muslim 9
 9 pratishat se badhkar 14
 2 percent, while Hindus fell from 85 percent to 79 in the same period
 6 pratishat par aa gaye
 Now if Sakshi Maharaj says that Hindu women should have four children, then they are becoming the character of laughter
 lekin desh ke bade hisse main muslim samudaay main ye silsilaa gambhirtha se jari he
 45 according to the National Family Health Survey conducted in 2005-06
 7 pratishat muslim dampatti hi parivaar niyojan ke sadhano kaa upyog kar rahe hai
 Yes, Kerala is the exception, where the Muslim community is educated
 lekin in masalon par koi bhi muslim netaa na to badi takreer karata he or yadi kare bhi to use sunne koun aayega
 MP Asaduddin Owaisi says that a Muslim can contest from the same seat where more than 30 percent of the Muslims are there
 varanaa uskaa jeetna naammumkin he
 No one else will vote for them
 ovaisi ke is tark se yah baat phir spasht hoti he ki vot bank politics muslim netaaon kii majaburi he
 And by speaking religious things, it only improves

 During the hearing of the noise pollution case in Mumbai, the Supreme Court said that Dandiya has been running for so many years, but there was no problem so far, what is the problem now? The Supreme Court made these remarks during the hearing on the application in which the Supreme Court lifted the ban on the order of the Bombay High Court

 The High Court considered the change made by the Central Government in the 2000 noise pollution rules as unconstitutional, prima facie it was contrary to Articles 21 and 14 of the Constitution
 hoicourt ne yah bhi kaha he ki sarkaar ne kanoon main badlaav karte samay janhit se jude siddhant kaa paalan nahin kiya he
 It has been made mandatory under the environmental law, but the Central Government and the State Government have not followed it

 isse pehle kii sunwaayee main desh kii sheersh adaalat ne ise dharm or aasthaa se judaa maamla bataate hue tamaam pakshakaron se aapasi baatcheet ke jariye hal khojane ko kaha tha
 Even the court offered arbitration when needed
 court ne ek hafte kaa samay diya tha
 Now the court is in favor of giving more time for conciliation efforts
 adaalat kii is pahal se puure desh ko dashakon se chale aa rahe is samvedansheel maamle ke jald samaadhaan kii ummid jaagi he
 But how much scope is there for an out-of-court settlement in this case: what do the parties say? One of the biggest aspects of the Ayodhya case is that no matter how much controversy has arisen in the country, there has never been a riot in Ayodhya
 is maamle ke tamaam pakshakaar kehete hai ki iskaa shantipurvak samaadhaan sambhav he bas baahar ke log maahaul kharaab na karen
 Mahant Gyandas of Hanumangarhi temple said that Subramanian Swamy has complicated the Ram temple case
 sabaki sahmati se or nyaayalay kii madhyasthata main is maamle kaa shantipurna samaadhaan hona chahie
 Both sides can agree on this
 vahiin duusare pakshakaar ikbaal ansaari kaa kahana he ki parisar main hi ram mandir or masjid kaa nirmaan ho saktaa he
 The High Court ruled on this basis
 is maamle main nae raajnneetik vivaad paidaa karne kii koshishen nahin honi chahie
 Negotiations can resolve the matter
 kin 4 sharton par atak rahi baat?ayodhya menram mandirke mudde par out of court setlement ko lekar supreme court kii tippanee ke baad ajtak ne baatcheet kii pahal kii
 Aaj Tak spoke to both the parties on the matter and tried to bring forth their opinion regarding the resolution of the issue
 hindu or musalmaan donon hi pakshon ne kaha ki is maamle par centre sarkaar donon pakshon se alag-alag baat kare
 The parties put forward several issues to resolve the issue, including four conditions - condition 1 - 2
 7 acre jameen par bane ram mandir-masjid
 Condition 2 - Condition - Center to send the initiative to move forward
 shart 3- subramanyam swami or haji mehboob jaise vivaad badhaane vaale log dur rahen
 Condition 4 - In Ayodhya, the two parties sit together
 kise roda maan rahe hai pakshakarsupreme court main ramajnmabhumi-babari masjid bhoomi vivaad kii ahm sunwaayee se thik pehle is maamle main mukhya pakshakaar swargeey hashim ansaari ke putr ikbaal ansaari or uttar pradesh sunni central vakf board ne bijepi netasubramanyam swaamiki ore se supreme court main maamla uthaaye jane par sakht virodh kiya he
 Both have complained in writing to the Registrar General of the Supreme Court
 shikaayat main kaha gaya he ki subramanyam swami is maamle main pakshakaar nahin hai, unka is cese se koi lenaa dena nahi hai, unhone is masale main party banane ke liye adaalat main yachika daayar kii thi, jis par kai pakshakaron ne etraj jaahir kiya tha
 According to Iqbal Ansari and the Waqf Board, the court has not yet taken any decision on whether to make Swamy a party
 lekin iske baavjood 21 march ko swami ne, maamle ke asal pakshakaron ko suchit kiye bina hi jald sunwaayee ke liye supreme court main ye maamla uthaa diya
 9 attempts have been made for reconciliation
 It is not that this is the first attempt of reconciliation in this case
 isse pehle 9 baar sulah kii koshish ho chuki he or pradhananmatri ke str se bhi koshishen ho chuki hai
 The first attempt at reconciliation was made in 1859 regarding the Babri Masjid and the Ram Temple
 hindu or musalmaan ke bich dange ke baad angrej afasaron ne donon pakshon ke jimmedaar logon ko baitaakar maamle ko khatm karaane kii koshish kii or baad lagaakar vivaadit jagah ko do bhaagon main baant diya
 But this did not solve it
 -1949 main babari masjid main murtiyon rakhe jane ke baad namaaj padhaa janaa band ho gaya
 Riots took place across the country after the Babri demolition in 1992
 pivi narsimha raav ke pradhanmantri ke kaal main ek kamishan gathit kiya gaya, donon pakshon se baatcheet kii koshishen huin lekin baatcheet nattejey tak naa pahunch pai
 Atal Bihari Vajpayee also tried to reconcile during his tenure
 vaajapeyi ne isko lekar donon pakshon se baat bhi kii lekin wo donon pakshon ko samjhauton ke liye ek manch par nahin laa paae
 - On May 31, 2016, a meeting was scheduled between Hashim Ansari and Mahant Narendra Giri over the dispute but Hashim Ansari had an earlier arrangement and this meeting never happened again

 The High Court ordered the land to be distributed equally between Ramlala Virajaman, Nirmohi Akhara and Sunni Waqf Board
 hoicourt ke faisle ke khilaaf sabhi pakshakaron ne supremecourt main apilen daakhil kar rakhi hai jo ki pichley chah saal se lambit hai
 68-year journey 1528: It is claimed that the Babri Masjid was built in Ayodhya
 1949: babari masjid main gupt rup se bhagwaan ram kii murti rakh di gai
 It is claimed that this was the birth of Lord Rama
 iske baad ye daawey saamne aae ki mandir hataakar babari masjid banavaai gai thi
 1984: a committee was formed for the construction of the temple
 1986: is vivaadit sthal ko shraddhaluon ke liye kholaa gaya
 In the same year 1986, the Babri Masjid Committee was formed
 1990: laal krishna adwani ne deshvyapee rathyatra kii shuruyaat kii
 In 1991, the rath yatra was won by the BJP and it came to power in UP
 mandir banane ke liye deshbhar se inten bheji gayi
 1992: Thousands of servants reached Ayodhya on 6 December and demolished the Babri Masjid, which was followed by communal riots
 1992: nyaayumurti librehan kii adhyakshata main ek jaanch ayog kaa gathan kiya gaya
 1993: This commission started investigation
 2002: vivaadit sthal par saikadon shraddhaluon kaa jamaavada shuru hua
 The ASI of the High Court was asked to investigate whether there was a mosque there before in 1528
 2003: eesai ne kaha ki mandir avshesh ke saboot hai
 2009: Liberhan Commission submits its report
 2010: hoicourt ne in vivaadit sthal ko teen hisson main baantne kaa faisla sunaaya
 2011: Supreme Court stays the High Court's decision
 kya he aage kii raah?supreme court ne dono pakshon ko aapasi sulah se bich kaa rasta nikaalane kaa mauka diya or saath hi kaha he ki agar baat nahin banati to adaalat apana faisla sunayegi
 It is now up to the Modi government at the center and the Yogi government of UP to take the conversation forward
 bijepi ne baatcheet se maamle kaa hal nikalne kii ummid jataai he saath hi kaha he ki gatirodh ko dur kar ram mandir banegaa
 The Congress has described this as a big opportunity for a solution
 lekin bijepi netaa subramanyam swami ke is bayaan par bavaal machaa ki masjid sarayu paar banaaya jaae
 Also, if there is no consensus on the temple issue, then in 2018 when the BJP has a majority in the Rajya Sabha, a law will be made
 dekhnaa hoga ki siyasat ke bich ram mandir kaa mudda kis ore badhata he wo bhi tab jab desh kii sheersh adaalat sulah ke paksh main he
 Have you ever seen a parrot dancing openly to the tune of Bhangra? No no We are showing you a parrot who does tremendous bhangra and it is very difficult to do its steps

 As the song picks up speed, the parrot also accelerates the bhangra steps with its wings
 to dekhen ye video or hanse: Vivek Oberoi, who is said to be the biggest actor of the big screen, is ready to play Bachchan Katha again
 hua yah ki ramgopal verma ne apni taaja film rakt charitra ke kuch hisse abhishek bachchan ko dikhaae
 And Chhote Bachchan praised the film on Twitter and gave Vivek such an opportunity which he could never make the mistake of missing
 natijatan, unhone apane doston ko yah baat badi shaan se bataai ki kaise abhishek film main unki acting dekhakar gadgad ho gaye jabaki abhishek ne kuch nahin kaha
 Someone rightly said that if Khuda Na Khasta Ramu would have done the same thing with Aishwarya Rai (though she would hardly agree to it), Vivek would have danced fiercely
 kul milakar donon khush hai
 Hail, Vivek ji! mukhyamantri nitish kumaar kii puraani maang he ki bihar ko vishesh rajya kaa darja diya jaae
 Now RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav has written a letter to Nitish about this
 aam bajet main bihar kii andekhi ko lekar tejasvi yadav ne apane patr main kaha he ki vartmaan bihar sarkaar logon ko yah kahkar bhramit kar rahi he ki centre or rajya main ek hi gathbandhan kii sarkaar hone se vikaas ko gati milegi magar aisa kuch bhi nahin ho rahaa he
 In the letter to the Chief Minister, Tejashwi has said that according to the present state government, there is a double engine government in the state, but till now only the incidents of crime have got double engine after the formation of this new government
 tejasvi ne kaha ki centre or rajya sarkaar kinhin agyaat vajahon se kisi prakaar kaa koi talmail nahin bana paa rahi he
 Janata Tejashwi, who is in the coalition, said that the BJP and JDU leaders in the alliance are trying to establish political supremacy over each other and the people of Bihar are being crushed in this intent
 tejasvi ne nitish par aarope lagaaya ki bhaajapa ke saath sarkaar banane ke baavjood vah centre sarkaar se bihar ko kuch bhi nahin dilava paae, naa vishesh rajya kaa darja, naa vishesh package or naa hi baadh raahat ke naam par raashi
 Tejashwi said that during the 2015 assembly elections, Nitish Kumar used to narrate the recording of the Prime Minister's promise to the people of Bihar in his meetings, but now after forming the government with BJP, Nitish Kumar should have paid Rs 15 lakhs according to all Put people into account
 adhikaar raily kyon nahin?nitish par tanj kasate hue tejasvi yadav ne apane patr main likhaa ki bihar ko vishesh rajya kaa darja dilaane ke liye unhone adhikaar raily kaa bhi aayojan kiya tha lekin ab vah bihar kovishesh rajya kaa darjadilane ke liye adhikaar raily kaa aayojan kyon nahin kar rahe hai?tejasvi ne nitish kumaar se kaha ki unhen himmat jutani chahie or aam bajet main bihar kii jo andekhi hui he uske khilaaf aawaaj uthaani chahie
 Tejashwi said that if Nitish Kumar fails to get the status of a special state, then the people of Bihar will know that the demand for a special state was a fictitious claim of their politics and only a jumla
