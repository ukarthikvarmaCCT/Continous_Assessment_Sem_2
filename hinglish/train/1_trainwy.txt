 As soon as the information was received, the NGO took the three innocent people to their 'prayas Children Home' and informed the Jahangirpuri police
 police or enjio ne teenon masuumon ko ilaaj ke liye aspataal main bhartee karavaaya
 After treatment, the three are now kept in the Children's Home's clinic room

 They used to get paid only 2000 rupees per month in the name of wages

 Innocents told that four more children work in the factory besides them
 lekin jab enjio ke saath police factory pahunchi to factory maalik ne chaaron bacchon ko vahaan se gaayab kar diya tha or khud bhi factory band kar faraar ho chukaa tha
 Currently, the three children were introduced to the CWC after the matter came to light

 Kejriwal did not like the ball Inaugurating a cricket tournament at Bazalakshmi Nagar, Kejriwal himself took a bat on the pitch and started playing the innings
 kejariwal ne idhar balla thama or udhar se gendbaaji karne ke liye dauda gendbaaj, ball nahin phenk paaya
 Kejriwal, in his old style, sarcastically said that your bowler is not right
 AAP ke 20 vidhayakon par hogi 'dayaa'? raashtrapati aaj suna sakate hai faisalabollar ne duusari gend phenki or kejariwal ne of said main gend ko badi khubsuurati se cat laga diya
 The applause rang, but the noise of these applause could not hide the wrinkles on the faces of the party and the leaders
 kejariwal ko mila mamata banerjee kaa saathhaalanki, is vidhayakon se judi musiibat kii ghadi main arvind kejariwal ke saath jahaan pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee khadi najar ain
 On the other hand, Brinda Karat, the leader of Mamata Banerjee's anti-communist party, is also standing in support of 20 mlas of Aam Aadmi Party and Arvind Kejriwal, attacking the Election Commission
 EC kii sifarish par kejariwal kaa twit- ant main jeet sachai kii hoti havipakshi dalon ne maanga kejariwal se istifachunaav ayog kii ghoshnaa ke baad, BJP or congress ne kejariwal se istife kii maang kii he
 But the Aam Aadmi Party has accused the Election Commission of adopting a biased approach
 kejariwal jahaan ek yuddh hoicourt main lard rahe hai
 At the same time, another front has opened for him on political ground
 in tamaam morchon par ladaai se pehle cricket ke morchen par kejariwal ne aaj ek daanv khel hi diya
 Significantly, the Kejriwal government, while pleading for the help of its ministers, appointed 21 mlas as parliamentary secretaries in March 2015, after which lawyer Prashant Patel challenged these appointments citing the matter of office of profit
 maamla raashtrapati se hota hua chunaav ayog or dilli hoicourt tak pahunchaa, jiske baad shuukravaar ko chunaav ayog ne raashtrapati ko raay bheji ki in vidhayakon ko ayogy ghoshit kiya jaae, jiske baad ab sabaki najar raashtrapati par he

 Also, Ramlila Maidan was also mentioned indirectly
 bhaajapa ke rajeev pratap rudi ne ucch shiksha ke mudde par aadhe ghante kii charchaa main bhaag lete hue champaran ke bare main sibbal ke purv bayaan ko lekar unhe aade haath liya
 He claimed that the minister is not aware of the historical significance of Champaran

 But those letters were also written in Hindi, that is why they did not get much attention
 unhone sibbal dwaara diye jane vaale vibhinn aashwaasano kii ore ishaara karte hue kaha, ‘yadi aap isi tarah kii ghoshnaaen karte rahe to sarkaar kii saakh giregi
 The crowd will increase in Ramlila Maidan

 RJD leader and head of Sinhaul Panchayat Anil Kumar was returning home after showing a doctor in Saharsa district of Bihar
 bich raste main motorcycle-savaar teen hamalaavaron ne unhen roak liya or chaar goliyaan unke sharir main utaar deen
 Kumar died
 ve teen baar se panchayat ke mukhiya the or is baar unhone apni patni amanna devi ko chunaav main khadaa kiya tha, kyonki seat mahilaon ke liye arakshit kar di gai thi
 Bihar was the first state in the country where women were given 50 per cent reservation in panchayats of all levels through the Bihar Panchayat Raj Act 2006
 36 baras ke salauddin ali anil kumaar ke mukaable khushkismat rahe
 Salauddin, the current head of the Chordargah panchayat in Sheikhpura district, was also on his way home on April 4 after two bike-riding men stopped his car
 salauddin ne unhen apana matadaata samajha
 He asked the driver to stop the car
 car rukii, unhone khidki kaa sheesha utaara or haath baahar nikaala
 He made a mistake here
 bike par baitha aadmi chillaaya, ''yahi he mukhiya'' or peeche baithe aadmi ne palak jhapakate goli chalaa di
 Dhansi in front of Goli Ali's left arm
 hamalavar ne phir goli chalaai, magar is baar uski bandook kaa nishaanaa chook gaya
 Salauddin is associated with the ruling JD (U) and like Anil Kumar, he too is not contesting this time
 bihari paripati par chalate hue is yuva siyasatdan ne bhi apni bivi shabina ko chunaav main utaara he, kyonki unki seat bhi mahilaon ke liye arakshit ho gai he
 He says, "my adversaries are apparently upset by this
" unhen maaloom he ki main unhen jeetne nahin duungaa
 The bloodshed streaks have been drawn on the first and second round of panchayat elections
 bihar 10 daur main hone vaale panchayat chunaavon ke liye qamar kas rahaa he, jo 24 april se 30 may tak chalenge
 Of these, 8,397 panchayat chiefs will be elected
 unamem se 50 fisadi mahilaayein (arakshit siton par) hongi
 This is a contest that will outweigh the state assembly elections
 ahmiyat main na bhi ho to khoonkhrabe main to shartiya taur par
 The large number and extent of violence that has taken place in the first three rounds of the bloodshed contest is much more than the violence in the five rounds of assembly elections in November last year
 navada main ek shaks maaraa gaya, to ek or siyaasi kaaryakarta saharsa jile main buree tarah ghayal hua he
 Kapil Dev Singh, a Bahubali of the village in the southeastern district of Bihar, was beaten to death because he did not support the current head
 khoonkhrabe kaa dushchakrasal main or bhi pehle shuru ho chukaa tha
 On March 15, Pramod Rai, a well-known lawyer of Naugachia in eastern Bihar, was stabbed to death on March 15
 unhone jila parishad ke chunaav main apni patni renu devi ko maidan main utaarne kaa faisla kiya hi tha ki is vaardaat ko anjaam de diya gaya
 His younger brother Pawan Rai says, "this murder is a direct result of his wife's decision to contest elections
" chunaav khatm hone tak ham police ko jaanch karne denge
 After that we will see that there is justice
 '' pawan khud bhi philhal mukhiya hai, haalanki is baar unhone chunaav na ladgaye kaa faisla kiya or apni bhabhi ko chunaav jitaane ke liye puri ji-jaan se jute hue hai
 In the last five years, some 50 chiefs have been killed across the state
 pramod raay kii hatya ke ek din pehle ek or mukhiya pad ke ummidavaar kanhaiya singh kii goli markar jaan le lee gai
 At that time, he was sleeping in his house in Gopalganj
 yah bihar ke uttar-pashchimi muhane par basaa jila he or us naugachhiya se bilkul duusare chor par he, jahaan pramod raay kii hatya hui thi
 But the most horrific murder yet was that of Brijnathi Singh, who was considered a sympathizer of the democratic Janashakti Party
 patna ke bahari ilaake main 5 farvari ko do eke-47 riflon se unke sharir ko chalni kar diya gaya
 Brajnathi Singh had a criminal history
 2001 main hatya ke ek maamle main jail main rahete hue unhen gaanv kaa mukhiya chunaa gaya tha
 In addition, the use of assault rifles made it appear that they were victims of gang war
 magar zyada sambhaavna yahi he ki unki hatya panchayat chunaavon se judi hui thi
 Senior Superintendent of Police Manu Maharaj of Patna says that the wife of Sunil Rai, an opponent of Brajnathi, was contesting the panchayat elections for the position of block chief of Raghopur in Vaishali
 lekin isamen sabase badi rukaawat brajanathi bane hue the
 He was engaged in winning his relative Munni Devi
 munni devi block kii maujuuda mukhiya hai or dobaaraa chune jane ke liye khadi hui hai
 "we believe this was the main reason behind his murder," says SSP of Patna
 ''viypi mukhiyamukhiyaaon par achaanak hamalon kii baadh aane ke peeche vajah kya he? gaanv ke mukhiya kii ahmiyat to khayr hameshaa se thi, magar haal hi main adhikaron kaa nae sire se bantwaaraa hua he
 In this, his talk has now received a decisive weight in the use of funds for development schemes from both the central and state governments
 salauddin ne india today se kaha, ''maine ek saal main 2 karod rupye ke vikaas kaary karwaae hai
 If someone wants to work, money is not an issue
 phir tajjub kya ki kai badmaash panchayat chunaavon par apni nazren isliye gadaaye hue hai taaki ve apni jholii bhar saken
 With the increase in allocation of funds, local governments in Bihar have to face new challenges
 masalan, kaam ke prati kam samarpit or zyada dhanalolup log mukhiya banane kii hode main shaamil ho gaye hai
 a few years ago in June 2013, police raided the houses of two chiefs of West Champaran district
 chaanbin main inaki 4 karod rupye se zyada kii behisaab sampattiyaan kaa khulaasa hua tha
 The power of power and the possibilities of earning corruption along with it have attracted the worst kind of people
 bihar main manaregaa ke paison se esayuvi kharidne kaa chalan aam baat he
 Also Rs 20 lakhs
 se zyada farji job card mili hai, jo farji bhugtan main istemaal karne ke liye banaae gaye hai
 The government has received wild complaints of corruption against all the chiefs
 inamen panchayat shikshakon kii bhartee main bhrashtachar se lekar ek jile main saura balbon kii kharid ke liye gaanv ke mukhiya ke haathon aavantit 12
 9 crores Rs
 ke gaban ke aarope tak hai
 Suspicious conduct of the left chiefs in these complaints has put the government in disarray
 magar abhi tak aisa kam hi kuch hua he jo un par lagaam kas sake
 Today, being the head of village and countryside in Bihar has clearly become a very profitable deal
 alabatta badi taadaad main hatyaein yahi bataati hai ki yah phaayde kaa sauda baari jokhimon ke saath aata he
 Why are the heads on target? Although the money from centrally sponsored schemes has been reduced due to the recommendations of the 14th Finance Commission, there will be a huge jump in the non-plan assistance given to local and panchayat bodies
 2015-16 main jahaan yah rakam 2,948 karod ru
 7,701 crore in 2019-20
 ho jaaegi
 The total non-plan assistance amount during these five years was Rs 26,688 crore
 ke baraabar hogi
 This amount is used in the construction of Anganwadi centers and buildings in the development block

 She believes that instead of fictional news, she wants to believe in her film, her director and her character, which she has played very strongly
 kuch din pehle unke film pramotion na karne kii khabaron par nandana ne kaha, 'sabase pehle to main aapako yah bataa duun ki yah mere kariyar kii sabase alag or special film hi nahin balki kaaphi saahasik film bhi he or mujhe is film ke tahat har jagah champion sabit hona he
 All this is a blatant lie with Ketan under promotion

 Yes, it is true that i used to always ask Ketan about this film but i have never stuck to his promotion strategy
 film main neude or antarang drishyon ko lekar paidaa hue vivaad ke bare main unhone kaha, 'rang rasiyaa kaa focus kala or aazaadee par he,sex or neudity par nahin
 Asked if she has started taking her marriage more seriously after playing the roles of Saraswati and Lakshmi in Rang Rasiya, Nandana says, "I grew up worshiping these two goddesses
" khaskar saraswati kii jinhen hamaara puraa parivaar puujata he
 But with all my shortcomings and shortcomings, i would like to remain a human being

 bengal main sharada ghotaale kii chapet main mamata sarkaar ke ek ke baad ek kai varisht netaa sibiai kii changul main funsate ja rahe hai
 Although Mukul Roy, who holds the number-2 position in the Trinamool Congress, has been granted a week's time by the CBI, but everyone knows that neither the party nor Mukul Roy's problems have diminished
 ab purv sibiai sanyukt nideshak upain biswas, jo mamata mantrimandal main cabinet mantri bhi hai, unhen mamata banerjee ne sharada ghotaale par party or sarkaar kaa salaahkaar niyukt kiya he
 This means that he will chalk out a strategy on what should be the policy of the party and the government on the scam issue and how to respond to the cbi's steps
 yah kitna sarthak hoga, vah to aane vaale dinon main pataa chal paaegaa, lekin haa, is ghoshnaa se ek baat spasht ho gai he ki trinmul maanakar chal rahi he ki pichley do varshon se party kii niti vifal rahi or na hi janata main vah yah vishwaas dilaa pai ki centre kii sajeesh ke kaaran iske netaa ek ke baad ek sibiai dwaara jail bheje ja rahe hai
 At the same time, the party is neither giving the rational answer to the evidence which is with the CBI nor to its party workers
 mukul roy ne do dinon purv dilli main sweekaar kiya tha ki vah sharada ke karta-dharta sudipto sen se milte rahe hai, jisase party ke netaa maan rahe hai ki party ko or nuksaan hi hua he, lekin agar party ke duusare netaaon kii tarah sibiai ne poochtacha ke baad mukul roy ko bhi hiraasat main le liya to na keval party, balki party ke kaaryakartaaon ke manobal par bhi iskaa pratikul asar padegaa
 The CBI has given time to Mukul Roy, he will take advantage of it in search of a rational answer, but according to CBI sources, like the fodder scam of Bihar, the evidence in Sharada scam is based on documents, in which it is difficult for the accused to escape
 it happens
 philhal bengal ko jaanane vaale or bengal main rahane vaale sab logon kii nigahen aane vaale dinon main mukul roy se poochtacha par tiki hui he or sab ek hi sawaal kar rahe hai ki kya party ke anya netaaon kii tarah unki bhi giraftaar hogi? Engineering Projects India Limited has manager vacancy

 dilli ko bhavishya main jal sankat se bachaane ke liye aam aadmi party sarkaar barish ke pani kaa sanchay karegi
 At the Cabinet meeting of Delhi government on Tuesday, the proposal to start water harvesting work in Yamuna Flood Plains was approved
 dilli sachivalay main mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne dilli main ground water richarge karne kaa daawa kiya he
 Arvind Kejriwal said about the cabinet decision and said that there is a huge shortage of water all over the world
 desh ke alag-alag hisson main bhi pani kii baari killat ke bare main sunne ko miltaa he
 It is heard about Delhi that the condition of underground water is slowly deteriorating here
 un sab paristhitiyon ko dekhte hue or bhavishya ko dhyaan main rakhte hue dilli sarkaar ne yamuna flud plane main yamuna ke pani ke sanchayan kii bahut badi yojana banaai he
 This will help overcome water scarcity in the present time as well as deal with future water crisis
 dilli cabinet se aaj is prastaav ko manjuuri de di he
 For water harvesting, Arvind Kejriwal claimed that in the coming rains, water harvesting and ground water recharge will be started in the Yamuna Flood Plain
 is baar samay kam rah gaya, phir bhi ye ek thos shuruyaat hogi
 It will also come to know how many possibilities this project has
 iske rigelt se ye pataa chal sakegaa ki isaki sambhaavnaaen kitni vyapak hai
 The reports of the consultants and the iits indicate that the project has enormous potential
 yamuna kaa flud plane bahut bada he
 It has great water harvesting capacity
 aisa karke dilli kaa jal sankat dur kiya ja saktaa he
 This time we will start on a smaller scale
 isaki study ke aadhaar par agle saal ise puri tarah lagu kar diya jayega
 According to the Delhi government, water will be harvested along the stretch of the stretch from Palla to Wazirabad under this scheme
 ye puri tarah iko friendli hoga
 There will be no cement structure in it
 isamen chote-chote ponds banaaye jaaenge
 Water will not reach the Regal Yamuna in these ponds
 barish ke dinon main jab yamuna over flo karti he, tab ye over flo vaala pani in ponds main jayega
 When this water stops here for a while, then the bottom will be percolated
 jab pani yamuna main bahata he to use neeche parculet hone kaa time nahin miltaa lekin jab un ponds main pani thodi der tehregaa to neeche parculet hota jayega
 This time we will know the rate of calculation
 ye pani neeche kitni dur tak jayega ye bhi hamen pataa chal jayega
 Arvind Kejriwal further said that the good thing in Delhi is that the underwater slope here is coming from Yamuna towards the city
 agar ye slop ulta hota masalan shahar se yamuna kii taraf hota to ham pani store nahin kar sakate the
 Then the water of the city would also flow into the Yamuna
 ham jitna pani kaa sanchayan karenge wo shahar kii taraf neeche store hota jayega
 The consultant has told us where and where this water will be stored
 dilli sarkaar ko nae project ke liye centre sarkaar kii manjuuri kii zarurat hogi
 Explaining this, Kejriwal said that i myself met Union Water Power Minister Gajendra Shekhawat
 is project ko lekar vah bahut sakaaratmak the

 Narendra Modi's victory was so huge that even his alleged rival in the party, Sushma Swaraj, reached the TV channels to celebrate the victory

 Good days are ahead
 ’’ modi ne kuch kaha or minuton main yah twitor sandesh desh bhar main baar-baar sabase zyada retweet kiya jane vaala sandesh ban gaya
 Modi's victory in this general election had been decided for almost a month, only difference in opinion poll and poll after poll

 lambey samay se uttar or pashchim kii party kahi jane vaali bijepi dakshin or purv main apni jameen talashne ke liye sangharshrat thi
 This time Modi has made up the shortfall with alliances built in tact and strategically
 bijepi ko un ilaakon main bhi jameen mil gai, jo party ke akalan baahar rahaa karti thi
 Modi's new dhuribjp has also made inroads in states where it had no land and made its strong position strong like a rock elsewhere

 ve bataate hai, ‘‘bijepi ko isi tarah kaa janadesh 1999 main bhi mila tha lekin pehali baar lagbhag har rajya main modi lahar kaa asar dekha gaya
 This transformed the BJP into a vote-pulling machine
 ’’kareeb ek-tihaai bharat ne bijepi ko vot diya or use kattar hindutv ke tamge ke kaaran ‘‘achhut’’ hone se nijaat dilaa di
 Although this change in his favor was mainly due to his claims of development and good governance, efforts to join hands with allies also played an important role
 bijepi ne endie main 28 sahyogi juta liye
 However, only six of them are present in the Lok Sabha
 party pravaktaa prakaash javdekar kehete hai, ‘‘inamen zyaadaatar ke ek seat se zyada jeetne kii ummid nahin thi
 The strategy was to draw the vote bank of these parties to the BJP

 In Bihar, Lok Janshakti Party was instrumental in pulling Paswan votes, which number about 50,000 in all 40 seats in the state

 According to sources, Modi will first take decisions about the General Secretary (organization), who acts as a bridge between BJP and RSS
 yah pad abhi raamalaal ke paas he or kabhi modi isi pad par the
 Modi will bring relatively young leaders to the party's highest policy-making body, the Parliamentary Board, and give him the post of general secretary and assign responsibility for the Maharashtra and Haryana elections to be held this year

 But under the leadership of Mohan Bhagwat, the Sangh is not avoiding politics

 "the RSS still believes in rewriting textbooks and the Uniform Civil Code, but it will handle these matters peacefully," says Sharma

 peeth ne kaha tha, ‘bekhauf hokar or bagaiyr pakshpaat ke karrwai kiijie

 Giving the example of Mahatma Gandhi who never runs behind money and property, the bench said that today's leaders and bureaucrats must accept their mistake and follow the Father of the Nation
 adaalat ne kaha, ‘bhavishya main, janata in netaaon ko yaad rakhegi or kahegi ki unamem apni galati sweekaar karne kaa saahas tha
 The High Court also questioned the approval of the society by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Council (BMC) and Planning Authority MMRDA

 The Ministry of Defense will also have to tell which department it was issued if it was issued and whether that department has the authority to release it? The disputed building in Colaba in South Mumbai is seen as a threat to nearby defense installations

 is tarah ke logon, khaskar sahitya padhgaye vaale yuvaaon ko lakshya karke laprek yani kathith laghu prem katha ke chalan kii baat kahi gai
 The flow of Bakar Purana appears in this episode
 bakar puraana ko iske lekhak-prakaashak ne bachaler vyangy kaha he
 The real question is, how is their level? The book has been named 'bakar Sahitya' by the author and called it a new genre in Hindi literature
 asal main aisa nahin he
 It is an attempt to write a satire, which has become bored due to irresponsible default and not being tight
 is kitaab main amuman yuvaaon se jude kareeb 47 prasang hai
 It starts with cinema
 aam aadmi jab cinema jaataa he prasang main lekhak ne single screen cinema haul jane waalon, khaskar yuvaaon kii alhadbaaji ko vyangy kii shakl main jeevant karne kii koshish kii he
 How do they argue, quarrel, shrug and have fun by commenting during scenes
 phir hindi filmon main aisa hi kyon hota he lekh main khaskar '90 ke dashak ke bollywood kii masala filmon main baar-baar najar aane vaale trend ke bare main likhaa gaya he ki kaise inamen amuman hero shahari babu hota tha, hero garib or sasur amir hota tha, gunde balaatkaari hote the, jo safal nahin ho pate
 Similarly, there is a satirical interpretation of songs like Jumme Ki Raat, Baby Doll Main Sone Di, Fevicol Se
 puri kitaab main mukhya taur par college life yaa pratiyogi parikshaon kii taiyaari karne vaale yuvaaon ke rahan-sahan, unki mouj-masti or prem main padane ke vividh prasang hai
 For example, how they borrow the clothes and shoes of their peers, try to woo the girls and in this way their band also plays
 kitaab main makar sankranti, dilli kii holi, korporate diwaali, vrath vaale chips, vrath vaali chaat jaise prasang bhi hai
 In Valentine's Week, there is a context of giving gifts to the girlfriends according to every day of the youth and living in this affair
 aakhir main buddha-anand samvaad khand main samvaad ke jariye tej sangeet bajaakar padosiyon ko pareshaan karne ko haramkhori to chetan bhagat ke noval padhuya morrkhtaa bataaya gaya he
 The total deposit of Bakar Purana is that in this book, in most of the passages, it is unnecessary and in the sarcasm that there is no edge that an unintentional smile runs across the face

 Q
 kya 2019 kaa chunaav ‘nyaay’ or rashtrawaad ke bich yuddh jaisaa he?nahin! 2019 kaa chunaav teen yaa chaar alag-alag morchon par ladaa ja rahaa he
 First, we are facing a severe unemployment crisis; Youth are not getting jobs all over the country
 doosraa krishi he; narendra modi kii nitiyon ne krishi ko tabah kar diya he
 The third is that the economy is not showing the pace it should have been; Transactions are not happening, the steady economic growth that we saw in the UPA years has come to a standstill
 do antim morche jo hai unamem se ek to spasht he ki modi ne rafel saude main bade paimaane par bhrashtachar kiya he or doosraa desh ke sansthaanon- supreme court, chunaav ayog, yojana ayog vagairah par hamale ke prayaas kar unhen prabhavit karne kii koshish he, taaki ve modi kii raajnneeti chamakaane main madad karen
 But the BJP and Modi have turned the election towards a discussion on security, nationalism and patriotism
 modi rashtriya suraksha kaa istemaal desh ke bade muddon se dhyaan hataane ke liye karte hai
 The youth are unemployed and do not see any future for themselves
 yah bahut bada rashtriya mudda he
 Why does the Prime Minister not speak about his record on unemployment in his speeches? Is the suicide of farmers on a large scale not a major national issue? Farmers are committing suicides
 to pradhanmantri ne yah kyon nahin kehete ki maine aapako vachan diya tha ki main 2 karod naukariyaan duungaa, lekin main asafal rahaa
 i had promised that i would put 15 lakh rupees in every bank account, i was unsuccessful
 maine vachan diya tha ki krishi ko puri praathamikta di jaaegi, main usamen bhi asafal rahaa
 These are real national issues
 ve in par kyon nahin bolte hai?kya bhaajapa jis suraksha ke mudde ko uthaa rahi he vah desh ke saamne vaaki asli khatra he?raashtra ke liye sabase bada khatra yah he ki 1990 ke dashak main desh main jo kaarykram prabhavi the, ve ab asardaar nahin rahe or modi ne ise sweekaar karne se inkaar kar diya
 We have accepted it
 hamaari nitiyon ne lagbhag 2012 tak kaam kiya
 In the last two years of the UPA, we started to falter
 modi vahi kar rahe hai, jo hamane 2012 or 2014 ke bich karne kii koshish kii thi
 He added a fad idea demonetization to it! Ask any trader what 'gabbar Singh Tax' and demonetisation did to him
 bade vyapaaree, chote vyapaaree, kisi se bhi puche len
 Ask the farmer, whichever he wishes
 modi ko yah vichaar kahaan se aayaa ki 500 ru
 And Rs 1,000
 ke note ko band kar dena, desh ke liye phydemand hoga? to, arthvyavastha ke saamne gahare sankat mandara rahe hai
 But the issue of terrorism in Pakistan is such that we need to fight it 100% firmly
 lekin main yah bhi chahta hum ki pradhanmantri jawaab den ki hamaare 45 siarpief jawan kaise mare? kya pradhanmantri bhartiya sainikon kii suraksha ke liye jimmedaar nahin hai? ve kyon nahin kehete ki main apane siarpief javaanon kii raksha karne main naakaam rahaa?unka kahana he ki apane kaarykaal main unhone do sargical strike kiye hai?bahut khub
 Manmohan Singhji made three surgical strikes but we did not beat the world in front of the drum
 iskaa kaaran yah he ki ham sashastr balon kaa raajnneetikaran nahin karnaa chaahate the, hamaare sainikon kii bahaduree kaa laabh nahin uthaanaa chaahate the
 This is their job, saluting them and honoring them
 ham unka raajnneetikaran karke unka apmaan nahin karte hai
 What was the result of those three surgical strikes? i do not want to talk about what was the result
 lekin jin lakshyon ko nishaanaa banane kaa lakshya rakhaa gaya tha, vah nishaanaa sateek laga tha
 The BJP says that the UPA government could not muster the courage to retaliate on the terrorist attack in Mumbai
 sachaai yah he ki hamane pakistan ko kootnithik rup se alag-thalag kar diya tha
 We launched an international campaign to isolate Pakistan on the Jammu and Kashmir issue
 hamane vahi kiya, jo karnaa tha, bas hamane uski raajnneeti nahin kii
 The present government has adopted a strict attitude towards Kashmir
 kya yah kargar he?jammu-kashmir kii museebaton kaa desh ke anya kshetron main rajnatik phayda uthaane ke alaava vartmaan sarkaar kii jammu-kashmir ko lekar koi niti nahin he
 Terrorism gained momentum again when Modi formed an opportunistic alliance with the PDP
 mujhe yaad he ki arun jetali se maine is bare main baat kii thi jab ve mujhase milane aae the
 i asked, "jaitley ji, do you realize what you are doing in Jammu and Kashmir? It is about to fire
 ” jetali ji ne mujhase kaha, “nahin aisa nahin he
 There is peace in Kashmir, nothing is going to happen there
 ” sachaai yah he ki pidipi ke saath gathbandhan karke modi ne jammu-kashmir main aatankwaad ke paanv pasaarne ke maukey de die
 How will you deal with the Kashmir problem? When the UPA government was in power, a policy was formulated for Jammu and Kashmir after much deliberation
 ise aakaar dene main meri bhi bhoomika thi or hamane is par kaam karne main varshon lagaae the
 We conducted panchayat elections; We took big Indian industrialists like Tata to Jammu and Kashmir so that the youth of the region get a new vision and jobs
 hamane swayan sahaayta samoohon ke madhyam se hajaaron mahilaon ko banking pranali se joda
 These steps helped us break the back of terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir
 jab ham 2004 main satta main aae, tab kashmir jal rahaa tha
 When we visited, the atmosphere in Kashmir was peaceful
 mujhe yaad he ki srinagar ke liye roj 50 flite uda karti thim, jo paryatakon ko kashmir lekar jaati thim
 So please look at our record and our policy, which is not only to crush terrorism but to connect with the people of Jammu and Kashmir to let them know that we have a different vision and it is much better
 yah bhartiya drushti he
 It is driving millions out of poverty
 is drushti ko apanaao, isamen tumhaara bhavishya he
 The BJP believes that abolishing Articles 370 and 35A will solve the Kashmir problem
 aapaki kya raay he?main in chizon main nahin janaa chahta hum
 i am simply saying that we are contesting national elections, and as far as i can see, national elections determine the future of the country
 jo sabase bade mudde desh ke saamne chunauti bane hai usamen pichley 45 varshon main berogari kii ucchtam dar, anaupchaarik kshetra kaa puri tarah tahas-nahas ho janaa, chote or majhole kaarobaaron kaa safaya, krishi kaa vinaash, arthvyavastha kaa vinaash or hamaare sabhi sansthaanon par hamalaa he
 What do you think about Modi's foreign policy? Modi has no foreign policy at all! They appear to be working on a daily basis
 masalan, ve afghanistan ke daure par jate hai or phir achaanak vahaan se pakistan jane kaa faisla kar lete hai
 They also do not understand that by flying from Afghanistan to Pakistan, they are giving negative message to the people of Afghanistan and their actions have upset the Afghan government
 unhen videsh niti kaa buniyadi gyaan bhi nahin he
 In fact, he feels that foreign policy means embracing more and more leaders of the world! You too were hugged by Narendra Modi
 ve videshi netaa nahin hai
 So, what is the difference between the embrace of Narendra Modi and the embrace of other foreign leaders? My embrace was full of love
 aap yah kaise kah sakate hai ki jab ve gale lagate hai to usamen pyaar nahin hota?mujhe aisa hi dikhataa he isliye main kah saktaa hum
 Their embrace is opportunistic
 maine ek piem ko dekha jinase chijen nahin sanbhal rahi thim
 i saw a PM who felt that running the country was not like running a state and he was trapped
 ve ek ke baad ek galtiyaan karte ja rahe the
 And were angry at me, yelling at me
 mujhe un par dayaa ai, unke liye pyaar mahasoos hua
 i said, I'm hugging you
 isliye maine unhen gale lagaaya
 i had a message for him to embrace, listen, i am your opponent, but in the interest of the country, i am ready to help you
 main aage badha lekin unhone mujhe dur kar diya
 He criticized you after that hug
 or aapane ‘chaukeedaar chor he’ kahana shuru kiya
 You say that you have compassion for them
 aap in donon chizon main saamanjasy kaise bataa sakate hai?main unke prati dayabhav rakhata hum, lekin main sach bolta hum
 i cannot ignore the truth
 sach to yah he ki piem ne anil ambani ko 30,000 karod rupye die hai
 You also know this, i also know, the whole country knows
 or anil ambani ne kabhi plane nahin banaaya! yah bhi sach he
 i have to tell the truth and the truth is that 'the watchman is a thief'
 isse peeche hatane kaa sawaal hi nahin
 There is no better way to say this
 agar aapako lagata he ‘ek chor, chaukeedaar he’ kahana behatar rahegaa to main aisa bhi kah saktaa hum
 You are repeatedly saying that Anil Ambani got Rs 30,000 crore, but the India Today report says that he has got a contract of Rs 800 crore
 rafel saude ke sahi aankadon ko darshane vaale kaaphi dastavej maujuud hai
 The Hindu newspaper has published documents in which the entire Defense Department is saying that the PM is having parallel talks
 unhone har ek niyam, har ek prakriya ko taak par rakh diya
 The Defense Minister said, "I am not aware of this new contract
 ” purana anubandh abhi band bhi nahin hua he, lekin pradhanmantri ek nayaa anubandh shuru kar rahe hai
 It will be investigated and they cannot avoid it
 to, kya congress ke satta main aane ke baad aap rafel saude kii jaanch shuru karaayenge?beshak! duniya kaa sabase bada raksha anubandh kisi aise vyakti ko de diya gaya he, jisane kabhi vimaan nahin banaaya he
 It will be investigated
 bhrashtachar khatm karne ke liye kya kadam uthaaenge?vikendrikaran bhrashtachar par ankush lagane kaa sabase prabhavi tarika he
 Today too much power is concentrated in the hands of very few people
 hamen nirnay prakriya ko badalanaa hoga or hamen vyavhaar main or adhik paardarshee hona hoga
 Strengthening RTI is important for this
 bhrashtachariyon ke khilaaf sakht or twarit karrwai bhi mahatvapurn he
 Will you conduct a probe into the influential people? It is not a question of following the influencers
 aisa nahin he ki ham badla bhanjane lagenge or kisi ke bhi peeche haath dhokar pad jaaenge
 There are laws, they should be followed
 lekin yah tabhi ho sakegaa, agar aap satta main lauten
 We are definitely coming to power
 congress akeli yaa gathbandhan ke saath?main koi jyotishi nahin hum, bhavishya nahin baanch saktaa
 But Modi is not winning the election, the BJP is not winning the election
 congress kii aguai vaala upie satta main aa rahaa he
 The BJP is asking voters to give them a majority
 vah majboot banaam majaboor sarkaar kaa tark de rahi he
 He claims that the opposition's coalition government will be weak
 ise samajhane main aap meri madad karen
 Is it a strong government that has brought us to the highest unemployment rate in 45 years? Is this a strong government, under which farmers are forced to commit suicide? Is it a strong government that does not trust itself and is engaged in crushing institutions? a strong government is one that says yes we are going to give you a job
 majboot sarkaar vah he jo desh ke logon ke saath judati he
 a strong government is one that says, 'supreme Court, we believe you, we trust you, do as you think appropriate
 hamamen itani himmat he ki aapako swatantra bane rahane denge
 'so, is the BJP government strong? No, this is a very weak government
 sahyogiyon kii talash main bhaajapa congress ke mukaable zyada tej nikali
 i love you guys so much! You have different rules for Congress, different for BJP
 tamilnadu, bihar, maharashtra, karnataka, jammu-kashmir, hamane kai pramukh rajyon main gathbandhan kiya he
 In some states, the alliance failed to make ends meet and this too happened
 sabase mahatvapurn uttar pradesh main gathbandhan kyon nahin hua?ham uttar pradesh main gathbandhan karnaa chaahate the, lekin samaajawaadee party or bahujan samaaj party ko laga ki unhen hamaari jarurat nahin he
 i respected his wish and said okay, fight alone but we are also going to regain our place
 maine priyanka or jyotiraditya se saaf kaha he ki hamaara sabase bada agenda he: upi main bhaajapa ko haraao
 Why did not Mamata Banerjee talk in West Bengal? Is Mamata Banerjee going to support BJP government or secular government? Will Mayawatiji and Mulayam ji support BJP or secular government? Whichever way you look, everywhere in the country the BJP is facing defeat from secular parties
 dilli main kya hua?hamane aam aadmi party ke saath charchaa kii
 There was an agreement of seat sharing with him that he would fight on four, leaving three for us
 or jab maine or meri party is par sahamat ho gai to kejariwal ne kaha ki ve gathbandhan kii baat main ab haryana or punjab ko bhi jodna chaahate hai
 They say that you backtracked
 yah saraasar galat he
 And they are telling you a liar
 jab main kuch kahata hum to main apane vachan par adig rahata hum
 You look at my old track record and decide on your own
 agar upie or uske sahyogi milakar sarkaar banaate hai to aisi sthiti main kya aap kisi gaiyr-congressi pradhanmantri kii baat par raji honge?meraa dhyaan bhaajapa ko haraane or sansthaanon ko bachaane par he
 Let's see what happens until the election is over
 parinaam aa jaaen phir hamaari charchaa hogi
 Sharad Pawar has said that only the one who has been the Chief Minister can become the Prime Minister
 kya yah anivaary shart ho sakati he?yah unki raay he
 Everyone has an opinion jahaan tak meraa sawaal he, mere saamne abhi ek hi lakshya dikhataa he, chunaavon main modi or bhaajapa ko haraakar desh kii sansthaaon kii raksha karnaa
 i do not see anything else
 arjuna kii tarah main keval machhlee kii aankh dekh rahaa hum or main us lakshya par prahaar karne vaala hum
 It is being said that you had two options to defeat the BJP and make your party stand again
 aapane doosraa vikalp chunaa or aap 2024 ko lakshya kar rahe hai, na ki 2019 ko
 
 
 certainly not! nothing of the sort
 ham yah chunaav jeetne ja rahe hai
 We are going to win the election strongly
 aap log isaki report nahin karte hai, aap log isse utsahit nahin hai, aapke upar dabaav he
 Inside, a big wave is going on against this government
 narendra modi or bhaajapa kaa patan hone ja rahaa he
 Where will the fund come from for the justice scheme you mentioned recently? There are two things in the justice plan
 yah garib logon ko garibi kii bediyon se baahar nikaalane main madad karegi lekin, utani hi mahatvapurn baat yah bhi he ki yah bhartiya arthvyavastha main phir se jaan phunkegi
 The breath of the economy that has been stalled due to demonetisation and poor GST will help to beat it again
 hamaare system main utkrisht arthshaastri hai or unhone kai maheenon tak is par kaam kiya he
 This money is not to be taken from the middle class
 yah main guarantee detaa hum
 For this, one rupee will not be raised by taxing you
 hamane gananaa kii he, paise kaa intjaam rajasav ke vartmaan sroton se hi kiya ja saktaa he
 By reducing wastage in government schemes and better monetization of government assets
 isamen se kuch paisa anil ambani jaise kroni capataliston se aane vaala he
 how will this happen? It is not like Modi's same thing that black money stashed abroad will be confiscated and brought to India and Rs 15 lakh in every account
 daale jaaenge?bilkul nahin! main modi se vipareet apane vaade nibhaataa hum
 We have created a financial model of justice and fully tested it
 meri team kaa maananaa he ki arthvyavastha ko koi nuksaan pahunchaae bina ise lagu kiya ja saktaa he
 Employment is most important
 lagata he, congress kii shuruaati yojana bahut sari sarkari naukariyaan dene kii he
 One, we have to revive the engine of our economy so that demand increases and this will help in creating new employment opportunities in large numbers
 is tarah ham pehle us str par pahunchenge, jahaan hamaari arthvyavastha modi ke haathon notebandi or gabbar singh tex thope jane se pehle khadi thi
 Justice is important in reviving our economic engine because it will reorganize the economy by putting cash in the hands of the poor
 ve ise kharch karenge, jisase maang paidaa hogi or hamaari arthvyavastha ko raftaar pakadaney main madad milegi
 Now let's talk about how we will move forward after reaching that position
 bharat duniya kii kaushal rajdhani he
 Every district has skills, but we do not respect them
 ham un kaushalon ko arthvyavastha se jodne ke bare main nahin sochate hai
 The core principle is to identify areas with specific skills and connect them to the Indian and global economy
 log ity ko ek badi safalataa kii kahani bataate hai
 What really happened was that the skills of Indian software engineers were linked to cities such as Bengaluru and even Silicon Valley and they were given an opportunity to prove themselves through their skills
 mirzapur yaa shreeperumbudur jaise kaushal ke hajaaron or hajaaron centre hai, jinamein tarakkee karne or lakhon naukariyaan paidaa karne kii kshamta he
 One more thing, we cannot afford to focus only on GDP growth
 jidipi vruddhi ko rojgaar srijan ke sandarbh main dekha janaa chahie
 Currently, there is no need for growth in GDP growth without creating new jobs in the country
 isamen nijee kshetra kahaan khadey honge? is yojana main unki bhoomika kya hogi?nai naukariyon ke srijan main nijee kshetra ahm hissedaar he
 There is plenty of space for both private and public sectors in the country
 ham shiksha or swasthya seva main baari nivesh karne ja rahe hai
 This will create millions of new government jobs
 shahrikrut bharat ko saarvajanik swasthya pranali or adhik majboot saarvajanik shiksha pranali kii aavashyaktaa he
 i am not saying that we should shut down private enterprises but there is room for institutions like the world-class public, iits, so that private players can say, 'oh, to be an a grade institution it has to be that' and they Have aspirations to become a level institution
 nijee udhyamon ke nirmaan main madad karne ke liye, hamane apane ghoshnaa patr main ek anoothaa vichaar rakhaa he
 The biggest problem for young start-up entrepreneurs today is that whenever they try to open a business, they first have to go to 15-16 government departments for permission, which usually means that they One has to pay bribe
 isliye, hamane faisla kiya he ki nayaa vyavsaay shuru karne ke liye sarkari anumati se teen saal kii chhot di jaaegi
 Three years later, when you have 20-30 people working, then you come and say that now, i want permission
 ham aapako anumati denge
 We want to reduce the barriers of our farmers, youth, entrepreneurs and give them a chance to grow to their full potential
 hamaara maananaa he ki isse lakhon nae rojgaar paidaa honge
 Are you in favor or against public sector disinvestment? Should Air India be shut down? You will forgive me but it seems childish to ask whether we are against it or in favor? We have a policy of public disinvestment
 kuch chizon kaa nijeekaran karnaa jaruri he
 Not at all for some other things
 isliye, aap iske paksh main hai yaa iske khilaaf hai”, jaise sawaal nahin hone chahie
 This is not a question to be asked from a national level leader, such questions are asked from high school children
 achche sawaalon ke saath mere paas aaie or main unke behatar uttar duungaa
 You have talked about debt waiver to end the agrarian crisis
 lekin modi aap par aarope lagaate hai ki aapane jin teen rajyon main haal main hi chunaav jite vahaan aapane ise lagu nahin kiya
 What is your view on agriculture? First of all let me say that we have kept our promise and our governments have officially announced farm loan waiver within 48 hours of swearing
 jaahir he, amal main samay lagata he
 Secondly, we understand that farm loan waiver is not a solution to the agricultural crisis
 yah aatmavishvaas badhaane vaala upaay he or hamaara uddeshy kisaanon ko unke tatkaal dard se raahat dilaanaa he
 Third, farmers do not get a fair price for produce because there is no cold chain, no storage facilities, no direct link between farms and dining tables
 to, ham khaadya prasanskaran ikaayiyon, buniyadi dhaanche, praudyogiki kaa upyog karke kheton ko joden
 Take steps to connect them with Indian and global economy
 saath hi, hamen samvedansheel hona hoga taaki kisaan buniyadi taur par aatmavishvaas na khoen
 What is your own philosophy of royalty? i prefer fairness
 kal mujhe lagegaa ki desh ke sabase bade udyogpatiyon ke saath galat vyavhaar ho rahaa he, to main unke liye kaam karuunga
 If i feel that farmers are being treated unfairly, then i will work for them
 main desh ke logon ke bich antar nahin karata
 My model is that where i see pain, i go there
 kal, sarkarein sabase bade korporate gharaanon ke saath anyaay karne lagen to main korporate gharaanon kii raksha karuunga
 i do not see the country as this / that
 main desh ko ek khubasurat sandhi ke rup main dekhtaa hum
 With our collective knowledge and our dialogue process, we can do very powerful things that other countries cannot do because we fundamentally believe in non-violence and compassion
 koi ek cheez aap narendra modi se siikhnaa chahen?ek saath kai logon ko vividh massej kaise die jaaen
 How can you say something to someone else at the same time and vice versa at the same time! However, there is a certain amount of deceit in it, which makes me uncomfortable and i am not capable of that
 lekin yah aisa kaushal he jo unke paas shartiya he
 This is his great strength
 mere liye 2014 kii haar sabase acchhee baat thi kyonki isane mujhe sikhaaya ki mujhe logon ke prati udaar rahanaa he, bhale hi log aapako gaali de rahe hon or aap par chilla rahe hon or maar rahe hon
 Do not kill him by turning, hug him
 koi aapako gaali de rahaa he, koi baat nahin
 Still respect him
 ek din maine narendra modi kaa saakshaatkaar dekha, “keval narendra modi hi narendra modi ko chunauti de sakate hai!” isane mere dimag ko sunn kar diya
 It seemed to me, "lord, how can a person have such a view towards the world?" When it comes to farming, a farmer can challenge me, you too can challenge me in some things
 kuch aisi chijen hai jinhen main jaanata hum, lekin main sab kuch nahin jaanata
 i am omniscient, this is the definition of eccentricity! i am a human being
 aapane mata-pita se netritv ke koun se gur siikhe?phir, ekangi, saadhaaran sawaal
 Leadership is variable
 paanch saal pehle kargar tha, vah ab kaam nahin karata
 Leadership is "listening"
 aapako baat pasand nahin aa rahi he, phir bhi aap sunen
 Listen to what is bothering you more
 koi aapkaa apmaan karata he to prayaas kariye samajhane ki vah aisa kyon kar rahaa he
 It is a dynamic process, it is a learning process
 to, aapane mata-pita se koun-se mulya siikhe hai?sabake saath prem karnaa
 Nothing else matters
 sabase pyaar karo
 Your adversaries, loved ones, enemies, people who hate you, animals
 is sansar se pyaar kariye kyonki yah khubasurat shay he!aap fitness ko lekar bahut sajag rahete hai
 What do you recommend for those who want to stay fit? kabhi-kabhi main apane doston ko sikhaata hum ki kaise daudna he or ve kehete hai main 5 kilometre nahin daud saktaa
 i say, don't be crazy, you can't run 5 km at the moment, but you can run 5 km, if you continue to practice continuously, we will run you 5 km to 10 km, then 20 km and 200 km ! But don't start with the idea that i won't be able to
 aap aisa kar sakate hai
 All this is stubbornness yah rosemara kii jindagi main bhi lagu hota he
 Everyone told me that Narendra Modi cannot be defeated
 maine kaha, “haa, aap aisa maanate hai?” maine poocha, mujhe bataao ki narendra modi kii takat kya he? unhone kaha, unki takat (bhrashtachar mukt) chhavi he
 i said, "okay, I'm going to wire this strength to them
" ” or maine yah kar dikhaaya he
 Insistence, my friend! Keep going and keep going
 or main bhi chalata rahoonga, jab tak ki rafel kii sachaai saamne nahin aa jaati!maa or bahan main aap pehle kis par bharosa karte hai?main maa or bahan se alag-alag chizon ke bare main salaah letaa hum
 But, generally i am quite open
 koi praathamikta?meri maa meri bahan he
 My sister is my mother
 donon ek hi hai, donon mere liye ek jaisaa sambal he
 They are no different
 lekin aapane priyanka ko pehle raajnneeti main aane se kyon roak diya? or ab unhen kyon utaara?priyanka ke bachche jab chote the, tab unhone raajnneeti se dur rahakar apana dhyaan unki parvarish par lagaaya
 Now that their children have grown up and are going to university, they felt that they could play a role in politics
 jab aapane congress adhyaksh ke rup main padbhaar sambhala, to manch puraane congressiyon se bharaa tha or aapane kaha tha ki aap manch ko khaali kar denge or yuvaaon ko sheersh par pahunchane kaa rasta taiyaar karenge
 Nevertheless, the day Priyanka joined, she became the general secretary and was inducted into the CWC
 to kuch logon ke liye jo congress main shaamil hona chaahate hai unke liye ek alag system he jahaan ve sidhe seedblusi main pahunch jate hai or duusare logon ke liye alag jahaan unhen ek tarakkee ke liye varshon tak narebaaji kerani hoti he
 How will you justify this? When you look, you will feel that to say that i will clear the stage is inspiring and very easy
 lekin yah ek ladaai he, ek yuddh he
 There is real conflict here
 or meri bahan us ladaai main ek puunji he
 i don't see my sister as my sister, i see her as a capital that will be able to fill that empty space
 congress main uske jaisi kai anya pratibhaaen hai
 Why didn't you hand over power to young leaders like Sachin Pilot and Jyotiraditya Scindia in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh? There are a large number of senior leaders who have given a lot of time, sacrificed for the party and have a lot of knowledge and experience
 jabardast urja or kshamta vaale kuch behad pratibhashali yuva netaa bhi hai
 i preferred the first experience and after some time, young energy will be given a chance
 vynad or amethi, donon siten jitate hai to donon main se koun si seat rakhenge?maine abhi is par kuch sochaa nahin he
 i will decide on this when the time comes
 kya aapane duusari seat se chunaav ladane kaa faisla amethi main haarane kii ashanka ke chalate kiya?bilkul nahin
 Amethi is my family
 haalanki, jab main apane jivan main pehali baar tamilnadu gaya, to maine mahasoos kiya ki vahaan ke log puch rahe the ki kya desh main hamaara samaan adhikaar he? yah bhaavana puure dakshin bharat main he
 The moment i realized it i said, i have to fight from the south
 mujhe dakshin ko yah bataanaa he ki nahin, aap bhi utane hi mahatvapurn hai jitna uttar he
 That is why i opted to fight Kerala
 narendra modi ne akshay kumaar ko bataaya ki unhen aam pasand hai, isliye ham jaananaa chaahate hai ki rahul gandhi ko koun-sa swaad yaa fal pasand he?main vipashyana karata hum
 The mind decides the taste of the fruit
 aap jis bhi fal ko chahen use pasand yaa naapsand kar sakate hai
 You can choose to like mango, you can choose to hate it
 aap garib logon ko pasand karnaa chun sakate hai, aap unase nafrat karnaa chun sakate hai
 You build everything in your mind
 man hi sab kuch tay karata he
 i can start hating someone, but after a little conversation, i will start looking at things from his eyes, and then i think that i really like this person; He is a very good man
 ’ lekin aapke prashn kaa uttar dena ho to main kahuunga: mujhe aam pasand he, mujhe kele pasand hai, mujhe gaajar kabhi pasand nahin thi, lekin ab main pasand karata hum
 i never loved Asparagus, but i do now
 kya aap pradhanmantri bananaa chahenge?iskaa faisla karne vaala main koun hota hum?yani, mana jaae ki aap pradhanmantri banane ke liye puri tarah taiyaar hai?main phir kahuunga ki iskaa faisla karne vaala main koun hum? lagbhag 90 karod log vot daal rahe hai, yah unhen tay karnaa he
 i am happy with whatever they choose
 sach kahuun to 23 may ko desh jo faisla sunayega, vahi sahi faisla hoga, chaahe vah faisla kuch bhi aae
 This is the right decision and i will respect it
 yahi bhartiya hone kaa taatpary he
 So no, as Modi says, you are naamdar, dynastic? It is unilateral
 mere parivaar ke sadsy raajnneeti main hai, lekin unka anubhav meraa anubhav nahin he
 My experience has been of tremendous struggle and violence
 maine apane pita or daadi kii maut dekhi he, maine chunaav jite or haare hai
 How can you sum up my entire experience in one word? i understand what i am, test him
 meri baat dhyaan se sunen or jo main hum uske aadhaar par meraa moolyankan karen
 We will fight 100% against the instigation of terrorism from Pakistan
 
 
 lekin main chahta hum ki pradhanmantri iskaa jawaab den ki siarpief ke 45 jawan kaise mareis baat kaa jawaab milanaa chahie ki duniya kaa sabase bada dephence kantract kisi aise shaks ko kaise de diya gaya jisane kabhi ek aircraft bhi nahin banayakya yah majboot sarkaar he jo hamen 45 saal kii sabase oonchi berogari dar ke daur main le ai he? kisaan aatmahatya kar rahe hai or sansthaaen kuchli ja rahi hainyay se arthvyavastha main jaan aa jaaegi

 Renowned poet Manjar Bhopali expressed grief that even after being born in India, Mushayars no longer get appreciation in their own country
 manjar ne kaha ‘kam hi log is baat ko jaanate hai ki kavi sammelnon kii tarah urdu mushaairon kaa janm bhi bharat main hi hua
 Mushayars started in the time of Bahadur Shah Zafar, but now in India itself, the appearance of Mushayars has become completely distorted
 ’ america, britain or australia samet duniya ke vibhinn deshon main mushaairon main apane fan kaa pradarshan karne vaale manjar ne kaha ‘videshon main logon main mushaairon ke prati jabardast utsaah hota he or ve maheenon se inkaa intjaar karte hai, lekin apane hi desh main ab jimmedaar sansthaaen iske prati puri tarah aankh band kiye hue hai

 jahaan ab bhi kavi sammelan hote hai, vahaan bhi log na to ras lekar inhen sunate hai or na hi kaviyon kaa utsahvardhan karte hai
 'varma said' Kavi Sammelan does not seem to have a ticket, so people think that when we do nothing, go to Kavi Sammelan

 The comments unhone kaha, ‘‘meraa anubhav to isaki ijaajat nahin detaa
 Even though i bowled well in that Test, i was not in the position to bowl so much

 ’’ Before the India tour of England, Bangladesh's young spinner Mehdi Hasan told how to bat English batsmen
 bangladesh ke is yuva spinner ne do test main 19 english ballebaazon ko out kiya or duusare test main jeet main ahm bhoomika nibhaai
 Now the English team trapped in the spin is fresh and the team India spinners Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja will be engaged in giving their weapons
 test main number ek gendbaaz kii ranking par kaabiz ravichandran aswin ke aankade hi england kii neend udaane ke liye kaaphi hai
 Ashwin completed his 200 Test wickets during the New Zealand Series
 kiwi team ke khilaaf is of spinner ne 3 test main 27 wicket hasil kiye
 Not only this, he has become the man of the series in 4 consecutive Test series
 tippaniyan Ravindra Jadeja, Ashwin's partner, also did not lag behind in batting
 jadeja ne newzealand series main 14 wicket jatke
 Jadeja holds the number 7 position in the ICC rankings
 newjiland ke khilaaf siries main in donon ne milakar jis tarah se kahar dhaaya, use dekhte hue lagata he ki england ko inase paar paane ke liye kuch special karnaa hoga
 In 3 Test matches of the recently concluded New Zealand series, the pair took 41 Kiwi wickets out of their total
 saal 2015 main dakshin africa ke khilaaf 4 test kii series main kul 70 main se 54 wicket isi jodi ke naam rahe the
 Both of them were rested in the ODI series against New Zealand, now both of them will be refreshed and take the field against England
 aswin ke paas to saal 2015 kii tarah saal 2016 main bhi sabase zyada test wicket lene kaa mauka he jabaki jadeja kaa target gend ke saath saath balle se bhi upyogi sabit hona he
 Apart from these two, the selectors also have the option of Amit Mishra, who was the man of the series in the ODI series against the New Zealand team
 ab phiraki main fansi english team ke hausale post he or team india kii spinners ravichandran aswin or rabindra jadeja apane hathiyaaron ko dhar dene main lage honge
 Ravichandran Ashwin's figures on the number one bowler ranking in Tests are enough to make England sleep
 aswin ne newzealand series ke dauraan apane 200 test wicket puure kiye
 The off-spinner took 27 wickets in 3 Tests against the Kiwi team
 yahi nahin, lagaataar 4 test series main ve main of da series bane hai
 The comments aswin ke jodidar rabindra jadeja bhi ballebaazon ko chakaane main peeche nahin
 Jadeja took 14 wickets in the New Zealand series
 isisi ranking main jadeja 7wein number par kabiz hai
 Given the way these two have played havoc in the series against New Zealand, it seems that England will have to do something special to overcome them
 haal hi main khatm hui newzealand series ke 3 test maichon main is jodi ne kul 60 main se 41 kiwi wicket apane naam kiye
 In the year 2015, in the 4 Test series against South Africa, 54 wickets out of a total of 70 were named by this pair
 in donon ko newzealand ke khilaaf vanade series main aaraam diya gaya tha, ab ye donon tarotaza hokar england ke khilaaf maidan par utrenge
 Ashwin has the chance to take the most Test wickets in the year 2016 as well as in 2015, while Jadeja's goal is to prove useful with the ball as well as with the bat
 in donon ke alaava chayankartaaon ke paas amit mishra kaa bhi vikalp he, jo newjiland team ke khilaaf vanade series main main of da series rahe
 Ravindra Jadeja, Ashwin's partner, also did not lag behind in batting
 jadeja ne newzealand series main 14 wicket jatke
 Jadeja holds the number 7 position in the ICC rankings
 newjiland ke khilaaf siries main in donon ne milakar jis tarah se kahar dhaaya, use dekhte hue lagata he ki england ko inase paar paane ke liye kuch special karnaa hoga

 pink ke baad ek baar phir badla ke jariye amitabh bachchan or taapasi pannu kii jodi ai he
 Badla is a suspense thriller drama
 is johnor main samay samay par filmein banati rahi hai
 The list of films like Being Cyrus, Gumnaam, Gupta, Baazigar, Woh Kaun Thi, Drishyam, Kahani and Andhadhun are quite long
 badla kii kahani main kaaphi majboot he or isamen jabardast suspence bhi he
 Let us know how the revenge has become compared to films like Kahaani and Andhadhun
 kya he film kii kahani:film kii kahani naina (taapasi pannu) kii he
 Naina is a young entrepreneur
 shaadishuda or ek bachche kii maa he
 However he is also in an extramarital affair with a married man named Arjun
 donon ek duusare ke parivaar waalon se chhip kar paris main milte hai
 Meanwhile, while going somewhere, a boy named Sunny is killed by Naina's car in a road accident
 jiske baad donon sani kii maut kaa saboot mitaate hai
 But someone blackmails them both regarding Sunny's death
 paise kii maang karata he
 The two arrive at a hotel to pay the blackmailer, which is where the twist in the story begins
 darasal, hotel main arjuna kii maut ho jaati he or iljaam naina par lagata he
 Amrita Singh plays Sunny's mother
 amitabh bachchan prosicuter ke role main hai, wo naina kaa cese tekal karne kii koshish karte najar aa rahe hai
 Now an attempt has been made to weave the film's story into a few questions
 jaise arjuna kii achaanak maut kaise hui? paise kii maang karne vaala hotel ke room par aata he, magar paise liye bina kyon chalaa jaataa he? amitabh kaa kirdaar kya he? blackmailer koun he? arjuna kii hatya kisne kii? aise tamaam sawaal jaanane ke liye film dekhnaa hoga
 By the way, suspense is different from the murder of Arjun which is associated with the title of the film
 interval tak film main jabardast suspence he
 Why see-the story of the film is strong
 shuru se lekar ant tak suspence banaae rakhaa gaya he
 Special attention has been paid to how to present characters in the film
 kahani jis tarah kii he, use filmana chunauteepurn kaam hota he
 But for this the direction and editing should be praised
 chunki film tamaam sawaalon ke jariye buni gai he, is vajah se ek sawaal kaa jawaab milane par aglaa sawaal film main dilchaspee banaae rakhata he
 Scenes have become good
 badla kii sabase acchhee baat yahi he ki ye bor nahin karti or ant tak dilchaspee banaae rakhti he
 However, the biggest weakness of this film is that the actors do not look very good
 ho saktaa he ki kahani main naatakeeyata bahut kam hone kii vajah se aisa he
 Badla will not be remembered for the very best acting of Amitabh Bachchan or Taapsee Pannu
 amrutha singh yaa duusare kalakaaron ke kaam apni jagah thik thaak kahe ja sakate hai
 Some outdoor locations of the film are effective
 suspence thriller drama main lits kaa bahut yogadan hota he
 The camera and lights have been put to good use in Badla
 kyon naa dekhen-zyada ghumaavdaar filmein dekhne ke aadi nahin hai to ye film aapke liye nahin he
 Not much work has been done on the dialogues of the film
 film kii kahani chahen jitani shandaar ho, behtareen tareeke se ise filmaaya gaya ho magar koi bhi film darshakon ke dil main sirf achche dialogs kii vajah se hi pahunch sakati he
 There are no songs in the film
 becoground score bhi mood ke hisaab se sahi kaha ja saktaa he
 Nandan Nilekani, Aadhaar's master mind and Infosys co-founder in the previous UPA government, has been appointed as the head of the Digital Payments Committee of the Reserve Bank
 arabiai ne digital pement ko badhaava dene ke liye digital pement cameti samiti gathit kii he
 This committee will have five members including Nilekani
 cameti main nilekani ke alaava purv arabiai dipti governor ech aar khan, vijaya bank ke purv emdi or siio kishor sanasee, iti or steel mantralay main purv sachiv aruna sharma or im ahdabad ke chif innovations officer sanjay jain shaamil hai

 iske alaava cameti digital pement ke adhik istemaal se arthvyavastha or vittiya samaveshan main teji laane ke liye cross country analysis bhi karegi
 This committee will submit its report 90 days after the first meeting
 koun hai nandan nilekanibata den ki desh kii duusari badi software niryaatak company infosis ne 2017 main nandan nilekani ko company kaa chairman niyukt kiya tha
 Nilekani, who was in the news for the Aadhaar project, was the company's chief executive officer from March 2002 to April 2007
 uske baad vah centre sarkaar ke bhartiya vishisht pahchaan praadhikaran yuidiai ke pramukh banaaye gayi
 Nilekani contested the 2014 Lok Sabha elections from the South seat of Bangalore on a Congress ticket
 haalanki, unhen bhaajapa ke anant kumaar se haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 He has not been active in politics since 2015
 aam aadmi party ne bijepi ke us twit par nishaanaa saadhaa he jisamen dilli bijepi adhyaksh or bijepi ke rashtriya pravaktaa yamuna vihaar main safai abhiyaan ke dauraan toilet ko saaf karne ke liye mineral water kaa istemaal kar rahe hai
 Aam Aadmi Party spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj tweeted on Manoj Tiwari's tweet that he remembers former Delhi BJP president Satish Upadhyay after seeing a picture of mineral water set-up
 From Satish Upadhyay(2014) to Manoj Tiwari(2017), little changed in BJP and so is their MCD

 com / sp4fas8emn — Saurabh Bharadwaj (@saurabh_mlagk) 2 October 2017 Saurabh Bharadwaj said, This picture is a reminder of how the garbage was spread on the clean road of Lodhi Road just to be photographed
 saurabh bharadwaj ne twitor par satish upaadhyaay kii 2014 kii us tasviir ko saajha kiya he
 Let us tell you that BJP leader Sambit Patra and MP Manoj Tiwari reached Yamuna Vihar in East Delhi as part of the cleanliness drive to sweep the street and clean the toilets
 aam aadmi party ke sanyojak arvind kejariwal ne unase paanch sawaal puche jane kii bijepi kii yojana par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki party chhipakar un par hamalaa kyon kar rahi he or saarvajanik bahes kii chunauti kyon nahin sweekaar kar rahi
 Kejriwal said, i have been asking him for public debate for a long time
 ve aad main chhipakar sawaal kyon puch rahe hai? aakar bahes kiijie or janata ke sawaalon kaa jawaab dijie
 Why are they not ready? bijepi ne kejariwal ke liye jo paanch prashn taiyaar kiye hai, unamem he ki unhone pichley saal congress kaa samarthan lekar sarkaar kyon banaai, jabaki unhone aisa nahin karne kaa vaada kiya tha
 There is another question as to why he did not fulfill his promise to file a case against former Chief Minister Sheila Dixit
 kejariwal ne ek baar phir daawa kiya ki aane vaale chunaav main bijepi ke kai varisht netaa kiran bedi ko haraane ke liye ek ho gaye hai
 He said, they were fighting among themselves before Kiranji came, now they are united to defeat him
 anna hajaare ke sahyogi rahe kejariwal ne matbhed hote hue bhi centre ke khilaaf nae sire se andolan chhodane kii anna kii yojana ko samarthan jataayaa he
 He said, i will support him in all his movements till he denies my help
 vah raajnneeti ko ganda samajhate hai, jabaki main ise saaf karne ke liye isamen shaamil hona jaruri samajhataa hum
 There is this difference of views
 agsit pole main congress ko bada nuksaanphir se fadanvis sarkaar kii vaapasi kaa anumaanprachaar main kaaphi pichhadi congressnitiyon ko lekar party main nahin bani ekareimaharashtra vidhansabha chunaav ke liye matdaan ho chukaa he
 The fate of the candidates will be decided on 24 October
 lekin nateezon se pehle aae india today-exis maai india agsit pole ke anumaanon se saaf he ki congress ko soobe main karaari shikast jhelni pad sakati he
 Here congress-ncp are contesting elections together
 is gathbandhan ko kul 288 main se sirf 72-90 siten milti dikh rahi hai
 The ruling bjp-shiv Sena alliance is going to come back again which is expected to get 166-194 seats
 congress party ko loksabhaa chunaav main karaari shikast mili thi
 Even in the Maharashtra Assembly elections, the condition of the party may remain the same
 maharashtra ke saath haryana main bhi vidhansabha chunaav hue hai
 Opposition in front of BJP in both the states looked helpless
 ek to loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi kii banpar jeet se vipakshi dalon ke hausale post hai to duusari ore sarkaar kii nitiyon ke aage bachaa hua vipaksh bhi ghutane tech chukaa he
 At present, the main opposition party Congress, leader and policy-less party looks like
 prachaar main kaaphi pichhadi congrescongress ko ab bhi apane adhyaksh kii talash he or party ne philhal sonia gandhi ko antarim adhyaksh bana rakhaa he
 At the same time, Rahul Gandhi, who left the post of Speaker after the defeat of the Lok Sabha elections, was very lagging behind in campaigning during the assembly elections
 donon rajyon main rahul gandhi ne sirf 7 reliyaan kii jabaki centre main sattadhari party ke sarvocch netaa pradhanmantri narendra modi ne haryana or maharashtra main 25 reliyon ko sambodhit kiya
 Rahul Gandhi went into the election campaign a week before the voting, where he did not even get the support of local leaders
 ek ore bijepi kii taraf se piem modi se lekar amit shah, nitin gadakari, rajnath singh or yogi adityanath jaise diggaj chunaav prachaar main utre the vahiin duusari ore congress main rahul gandhi ke alaava koi bada cheharaa party ke liye vot maangate nahin dikhaa
 At the last moment, former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh made a press conference while performing the ceremony
 sonia gandhi chunaav prachaar se dur raheen or unki jagah rahul gandhi ko raily kerani padi
 Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi also did not address a single rally in both the states
 vah sirf soshal media ke jariye bijepi kii nitiyon par nishaanaa sadhti raheen or visheshkar upi kii yogi sarkaar ko target karti raheen
 The state president of the Congress was also replaced just before the elections in Maharashtra
 sanjay nirupam kii jagah milind devda bhi is pad se hat gaye or balasaheb thoraat ko nayaa adhyaksh chunaa gaya
 Sanjay Nirupam and Milind Deora continued to question the party high command and did not even enter the election campaign
 yahaan tak in netaaon ne apane netaa rahul gandhi ke saath bhi manch saajha nahin kiye
 At the same time, Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis held a total of 65 election rallies and also reached 9 rallies with PM Modi
 lekin congress kii ore se maharashtra ke kisi bade netaa ne rahul gandhi ke saath manch tak saajha nahin kiya
 Unrecognized on issues, the Congress party in its election campaign surrounded the BJP on national issues
 pradhanmantri modi or bijepi jin muddon par janata se vot maang rahe the unheen rashtriya muddon ko lekar congress apane virodhiyon par nishaanaa saadh rahi thi
 From Section 370 to triple talaq, issues like NRC continued to be described by the BJP as their achievement, while the Congress continued to stick to their opposition
 kai mudden to aise rahe jinpar congress netaaon ke sur alag dikhe
 Leaders like Milind Deora have backed the removal of 370 from Kashmir, for which Congress is constantly targeting BJP and PM Modi
 congress maharashtra chunaav main pehle kii tarah notebandi, jiesti or neerav modi jaise mudde uthaati rahi jo ki 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main hi beasar sabit ho chuke hai
 Despite raising these issues in the entire Lok Sabha elections, the Congress was reduced to just 52 seats and the BJP was able to win 303 seats
 bijepi ne maharashtra chunaav main saavarkar ko bharat ratna dene kaa mudda bhi bich chunaav main uthaa diya jisapar congress fansati najar ai kyonki ise lekar bhi party kaa rukh saaf nahin rahaa or netaaon kii ore se tarah-tarah ke bayaan saamne aae
 The Congress, which was fighting without a face in Maharashtra, was confronted with the famous face of Devendra Fadnavis
 vahiin bijpi ke paas narendra modi ke naam kaa trump card bhi he
 It was also reflected in the exit poll estimates
 aise main agar ye anumaan nateezon se mail khate hai to congress ke liye maharashtra main aage kii raah or bhi mushkil ho sakati he
 SGTB Khalsa College of Delhi University also had to bear the payment of violent clash at Ramjas College
 jab vivaad hua usee dauraan har saal kii tarah is saal bhi khalsa college main nukkad naatak kaa aayojan hona tha
 There were 9 groups to participate in this drama, but the event was stopped
 khalsa college ke assistant professor or theatre ke sanyojak saikat ghosh ne aarope lagaaya ki DUSU se lagaataar milane vaali dhamkiyon ke baad kaarykram radd kiya gaya
 The play was on the patriotism of the Sangh, says Ghosh, there was to be a play on the nationalist love of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, but it was stopped
 ghosh kaa kahana he, 'kya hamen ye adhikaar nahin he ki ham apane naatak ke jariye ise dikhaa saken
 We also said that you should watch the drama first, then decide, but no one was ready to listen
 'police ne nahin kii madadghosh ne bataaya ki DUSU kii ore se lagaataar dhamkiyaan mil rahi thim or police ne bhi parisar main shanti or saamaanya sthiti behaal karne ke liye aayojan ko taal dene kii apil kii thi
 Ghosh also raised questions about the role of Napolis
 ghosh ke mutabik agar police suraksha detii to shaayad nukkad naatak kaa aayojan ho jaataa
 ABVP Ghosh only does hooliganism says that a similar incident happened two years ago
 jab ek naatak ke dauraanebivipi ne dhamkayaor majabuuran unhen naatak rokna padaa tha
 Ghosh says that the country's Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has also been a student of ABVP, but he fought the college against the Emergency
 ab abivipi badal gai he, sirf gundgardee karti he
 The country's largest investigative agency CBI is struggling with heavy workload and shortage of manpower
 beuro main kul 1584 pad khaali pade hai
 The CBI is busy with these cases amid increasing complaints of corruption in the country
 sibiai ke do purv nideshak hi bhrashtachar ke maamle main ghire hue hai
 However, CBI does not have enough officers to investigate these cases and due to this the investigation of cases remains stuck for a long time
 centre sarkaar ke mantralay diopiti kii 2016-17 kii report se pataa chalata he ki sibiai ke kul 7274 sweekrut padon main se 1584 pad khaali pade hai
 That is, more than 20% of the posts in the department are vacant and the task of investigating big cases across the country rests on the shoulders of only 5,690 officers
 diopiti kii report ke mutabik, sibiai main special diarector ke liye donon pad abhi khaali hai
 Apart from this, the post of Joint Director is also vacant, so there is no reinstatement for 25 posts of DIG level
 sibiai main khaali padaspecial diarector kaa 2 padjoint darector kaa 1 paddiaiji ke 25 padesaspi khel 8 padpulice adheekshak 37 padanireekshak ke 256 padaup nireekshak ke 230 padaconsteble ke 369 pad khaali he
 In all the cases of corruption that the CBI is looking at, there are cases going on against the administrative officials, besides many businessmen are also in the grip of the CBI
 aise main agar sarkaar kii taraf se adhikariyon kii bahaali nahin hoti he, to desh kii is sabase badi jaanch agency ke karypranali par asar padana laazmi he
 Women and school children of different classes today tied a rakhi on the wrist of Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan

 Police have detained the accused Kishore
 madiyaanw ke new daudanagar ilaake main majdoor chhutke apane parivaar ke saath rahata he
 Police said Chhutke's 12-year-old son Ankit had lent Rs 230 to a 14-year-old teenager, a fellow living in the neighborhood
 ankit kuch dinon se udhaar die rupee waapas maang rahaa tha
 Kishore asked to return the money borrowed from Ankit on Saturday night, but made a bet that for this he would have to walk to a special place
 ankit uske saath chal padaa
 Kishore took Ankit on an empty plot
 vahaan pahunchane par usne rupee dene se manaa kar diya
 Ankit was shocked by being cheated
 donon ke bich jhagada hone laga
 Meanwhile, Ankit stabbed Kishore on his head several times
 sir par gambhir chotein lagane se ankit kii maukey par hi maut ho gai
 Ankit ran away from there
 der raat hone par jab ankit ghar nahin pahunchaa to parivaar ke log use talashne lage, magar kuch pataa nahin chal sakaa
 On Sunday morning Ankit's blood-soaked body was seen lying on an empty plot
 khabar paakar maukey par kishor ke parivaar ke log or madiyaanw police bhi pahunchi
 After investigating the police, Ankit's body was sent for postmortem
 police ne aaropee kishor ko hiraasat main le liya he

 co / 03bisajfqc Swine flu is caused by the human version of H1N1, a type of influenza a virus
 H1N1 virus aam flu virus kii hi tarah failata he
 When an infected person coughs or sneezes, small droplets released from their breath are spread in the air and stay on the surrounding hard surface
 yadi koi swasthy vyakti is sankramit hawa main saans letaa yaa sankramit sataha ko choota he to virus uske andar chalaa jaataa he, or jab ye virus vyakti ke sampark main aate hai to swine flu se sankramit hone kaa khatra adhik hota he
 The virus of swine flu spreads from one person to another very fast
 H1N1 virus se peedit vyakti jab khaansata yaa cheenkta he to uski saanson se nikali buundon main tairkar ye virus aasapaas ke kathor sataha par chale jate hai or agle 24 ghanton tak usapar jivit rahete hai
 a sneeze from a person's body covers a distance of about one meter (3 feet)
 is dauraan agar agar koi swasthy vyakti swine flu ke rogi se kareeb 3 feet kii duuri par khadaa he to vah is virus se sankramit ho saktaa he
 Ordinary items such as door handles, remote controls, hand rails, pillows, computer keyboards, etc
 can be infected with the virus in infected droplets
 yadi koi vyakti in satahon ko choota bhi he to inaki sataha par baithe virus uske sharir main pravesh kar saktaa he

 The former Pakistan judge has made serious allegations against former military chief and President Pervez Musharraf, who are trying to return to politics there
 purv jaj javed ikbaal ne kaha he ki musharraf ne hajaaron nagarikon ko duusare deshon ko bechney kaa kaam kiya he
 Javed Iqbal is the head of the commission set up to investigate missing people in Pakistan
 unhone maanavadhikaron par bani sansad kii sthaayee samiti ke saamne yah aarope lagaaya he
 Javed Iqbal is also the head of the National Accountability Bureau of Pakistan
 ikbaal ne sansad kii sthaayee samiti ke saamne bayaan diya he ki musharraf ne 4000 se zyada pakistaniyon ko paison ke badale america ko bech diya
 He said that the whole process was carried out in secret
 in dinon pakistan main laapata logon ko lekar pashtun tahafuj andolan (pitim) chal rahaa he
 After this disclosure, there may be more upheaval in Pakistan's politics
 is andolan kii sabase badi maang he ki khaybar pakhtoonkhwaa praant or centre shasit kabyli ilaake (phata) ke vibhinn hisson se laapata hajaaron logon ke bare main pataa lagaaya jaae
 In Balochistan province, the government is finding it difficult to answer this question

 Musharraf's move has been termed as illegal and immoral by Iqbal's committee
 is maamle main or jaanch karne kii sifarish kii gai he
 Javed Iqbal has asked, "in spite of law and constitution how can anyone secretly sell Pakistani citizens to another country?" Let me tell you that none of the mps of Musharraf's step-elected government had questioned it

 The terrorist convicted and sentenced to death were hanged from the Supreme Court for the attack on the holiest site of Indian democracy
 isamen hairaani kii koi baat nahin he ki usase sahanubhuti rakhane vaale ek baar phir maanavadhikaron ke ulanghan kaa shor machaa rahe hai
 The answer lies in the words of the Supreme Court
 mananeey nyaayalay ne ise aisi ‘vibhats’ ghatana bataaya he jisamen baari hathiyaaron se las paanch logon ne andhadhundh golibari main nau logon kii jaan le lee or 16 ko ghayal kar diya
 In very strict language, these lives were no less valuable
 afjal guru se sahanubhuti rakhane waalon kii bhartiya raashtra or kashmir ke bharat kaa ang hone kii vaidhaniktaa ke bare main apni ek raay he or saubhaahgya kii baat he ki ham main se zyaadaatar log usase sahamat nahin hai
 The decent extent of disagreement ends here
 agar koi gut hinsa kaa sahaara letaa he to hamaari senaaon kii karrwai javaabi honi chahie, sulah kii nahin
 There is no doubt that the human rights of those who are investigated, who should be tried and convicted, should also be respected
 lekin kasaab jaise jo log markat karte range haath pakade jaaen yaa jinhen us nyaayik vyavastha ne puri chaanbin, or sunwaayee ke baad doshi tehraaya he, jisamen hamen aasthaa he, unke paas dayaa paane kaa koi adhikaar nahin he
 Unfortunately, the hanging of Afzal Guru is being condoned by telling stories of family suffering
 hamen kuch aansu un bahaduron ke liye bhi bahaane chahie, jinhone us din tirange kii khatir jaan qurbaan kar di
 There is no justification if the criticism of this hanging is to be tested against undisputed facts rather than exaggeration
 ghatana 2001 main hui
 The trial lasted a long time — the charges were settled in June 2002; The lower court ruled in December 2002 and the Supreme Court's final verdict was reached in 2005
 agar bachaav kaa koi tark tha use rakhane ke liye paryaapt samay tha
 The Supreme Court verdict takes into account certain facts: 2 a lawyer was arranged to appear on behalf of Afzal Guru who was present at the time of framing of charges
 unhone sweekaar kiya ki aarope tay karne ke liye paryaapt saamagree thi
 Criticism of his performance was rejected by the Supreme Court
 2 is vakil ke hatane ke baad doosraa vakil niyukt hua, jisane gavaahon se jirah kii
 Afzal Guru himself asked questions to some witnesses
 2 yah sach he ki afjal guru chaar varisht vakeelon kii sarkari suchi main se ek ko chahta tha, lekin ve uski vakaalat nahin karnaa chaahate the
 The first argument of a well-known senior lawyer appearing in the Supreme Court on behalf of Afzal Guru was that he was denied proper legal aid
 ucchtam nyaayalay ne is tark par gaharaai se vichaar kiya or thukraa diya
 The verdict also records how Afzal Guru's investigators (gilani took his name), what his role was, what evidence was against him, and then after a deep thought, he was convicted and heard The punishment was justified
 yah mukadmaa saaf taur par durlabh se durlabhtam kii shrenee main aata he
 Human rights of a person accused of a crime guarantee a fair trial in court
 yah bahut badi galatfahami he ki ucchtam nyaayalay ke faisle se asantusht doshi apradhi bharat ke raashtrapati se apil kar saktaa he
 The only way to question a verdict of any error appearing on the record is to file a reconsideration petition and be heard by the same judge (if they have not retired)

 Narayanan believes that the Supreme Court still has a role in the case and should take appropriate steps otherwise all efforts to improve the bcci's administrative structure will go in vain
 gopal shankaranarayanan ne ‘iespncricainfo’ se kaha, ‘agar aisa karne kii anumati di jaati he or agar adaalat main ise chunauti nahin di jaati or nyaayalay main bhi ise chunauti nahin milti yaa vah is par sangyaan nahin letaa he, to iskaa matlab nyaayalay or pichley varshon main kiye gaye kaaryon kaa uphaas karnaa hoga,’sanshodhit samvidhan main badlaav kaa prastaav shanivaar ko saamne aayaa, jab bisisiai ke nae sachiv jai shah ne board kii ek disambar ko mumbai main hone vaali vaarshik aam baithak (agm) ke liye agenda taiyaar kiya
 The most prominent amendments include changing the rules relating to the period of resting period for office bearers, relaxing various norms related to disqualification and ending the need to seek approval from the Supreme Court to make changes in the constitution

 Former Chief Justice RM Lodha was the chairman of this committee, which also included former Supreme Court judges RV Raveendran and Ashok Bhan
 shankaranarayanan ne kaha ki agar badlaavon ko apanaaya jaataa he, to unhen adaalat main chunauti di ja sakati he
 He said, 'they are trying to show that when they (BCCI) make changes (in the Constitution), they will not need the permission of the Supreme Court
 ’sudhaaron kaa khaakaa taiyaar karne main ahm bhoomika nibhaane vaale shankaranarayanan kaa haalanki maananaa he ki sheersh adaalat bhi vartmaan sthiti ke liye aanshik rup se jimmedaar he, kyonki usne sudhaaron ko kamjor karne main bhoomika nibhaai
 He said, 'if the amendments are unanimous, then it doesn't matter
 mere vichaar main adaalat kii bhi bhoomika hogi, kyonki adaalat kii is sab main bhoomika rahi he
 This was typical when the initial reforms were approved (in 2016)
 iske baad pichley saal prashaskon kii samiti (sioe) dwaara taiyaar or prastut kiye gaye samvidhan ko manjuuri di gai
 'sankaranarayanan said,' They could possibly try to argue that, look, the Supreme Court did not stop us from amending our own constitution, so we can amend it and make all kinds of changes Are capable
