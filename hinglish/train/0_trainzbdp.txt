 The judge was allowed to speak to Chidambaram who appeared in court
 The hearing is going on maamla rouj avenue court main chal rahaa he
 On behalf of Chidambaram in the court, Abhishek Manu Singhvi said that Chidambaram should be allowed to speak
 iske baad court ne unhen bolne kii ijaajat di
 He argued this when Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said that Chidambaram should not be allowed to speak among the lawyers
 singhvi ne kaha ki maamle main 6 logon ko mulgim banaaya gaya tha or varshon pehle unke bayaan darj kiye the lekin sibiai ne kisi ko bhi giraftaar karne kii koshish nahin kii
 Singhvi taunted that those who were released by the CBI might be their loved ones or loved ones
 blue id baby honge
 Apart from this, Singhvi said that after June 6, CBI did not even call Chidambaram and now he was bent on arresting suddenly? She was also under the cover of the statement of the woman who became an approver (indrani Mukherjee)
 court main chidambaram par sahyog na karne kaa aarope lagaaya gaya jiske baad singhvi ne kaha ki asahyog kaa matlab ye hota he ki aapane 10 baar bulaayaa or ham paanch baar naa jaaen
 But in this case, Chidambaram has not been called since June
 sibiai ko bataanaa hoga ki chidambaram jaanch main kaise sahyog nahin kar rahe the
 He said that the statement of immigrant is status, not evidence
 kya ye hi hamaare swatantraaa ke adhikaar hai? singhvi chidambaram ke paksh main sibiai court main daleel pesh kar rahe the
 During this time, the CBI demanded the remand of Chidambaram for 5 days from the court, on which Singhvi also opposed the demand for remand by the CBI
 singhvi ne kaha ki remand vishesh paristhitiyon main hi di jaati he or ye maamla sabooton se chhedchhad kaa nahin he
 Chidambaram has been arrested today and remand is being talked about today
 unhone kaha ki solicytor general tushaar mehta ne remand to maangi he par koi aarope in par nahin lagaaya he
 What are the allegations? The entire CBI approach is wrong in this case
 unhone kaha ki sibiai ne is maamle main kisi ko giraftaar nahin kiya
 Indrani Mukherjee's statement in this case formed the basis
 jaj ne poocha ki chidambaram ko saman kab jari kiya gaya tha? jawaab main singhvi ne kaha june 2018 main
 Singhvi said that you are not getting the answer you want to hear
 jo jawaab he vahi to denge
 Singhvi said that Chidambaram would not answer what the CBI wants to hear

 gat vijeta mumbai indiens team ko 121 ke score par rokna is team kii badi kamyaabi maani ja sakati he
 Team captain Dhoni said during the interaction that the arrival of foreign players was delayed, due to which the team could not get enough time to practice together, despite this the team's performance as a unit was excellent
 shanivaar ke match main pune team kii khaas baat yah rahi ki iske chaar gendbaajon ne apane pehle over kii pehali hi gend par wicket hasil kiya
 The comments wicket giraane kii shuruyaat team india ke gendbaaj eshanth sharma ne kii
 He came for bowling in the second over of the innings and was trapped leg before for the first ball by the opposition team captain Rohit Sharma
 iske baad baari michel marsh kii thi
 On the fifth ball of the innings and the first ball of his first over, he returned the pavilion to Hardik Pandya, playing in a dangerous manner
 is over main marsh ne josh butler kaa bhi wicket liya
 All-rounder Rajat Bhatia was also behind
 unhone apane pehle over (pari kaa aathvaan over) main pollard ko chalata kiya
 Surprisingly, Dhoni brought his 'trump card' Ravichandran Ashwin to the bowling too late
 ravichandran aswin 16wein over main gendbaaji ke liye aae or unhone pehali hi gend par ambati raidu kaa wicket hasil kiya
 Dhoni used a total of six bowlers in the match and four of them brought success on the very first ball of his first over
 ek or khaas baat yah rahi ki istemaal kiye gaye sabhi chhahon gendbaajon ne kam se kam ek wicket jarur liya
 The fall of wickets started by Ishant Sharma, Team India's bowler
 ve pari ke duusare over main gendbaaji ke liye aae or apni pehali hi gend par vipakshi team ke captain rohit sharma ko pagabaadha out kiya
 It was followed by Mitchell Marsh

 match main dhoni ne kul chah gendbaajon kaa istemaal kiya or isamen se chaar apane pehle over kii pehali hi gend par safalataa lekar aae
 Another special thing is that all the six bowlers used to take at least one wicket

 kai bank ke adhikari-clerk mujhe likh rahe hai ki bank kii taraf se unhen share lene ke liye majaboor kiya ja rahaa he
 No one is taking shares on their own free will, but everyone is being pressured to call them through a senior officer to buy those shares
 manageron ke bare main bank yah tay kare ki aap do lakh rupee ke share khreeden or wo bhi bank ke to yah kuch or he
 Rather, nothing is a direct slavery
 yah mumkin hota hua dekh paa rahaa hum ki itane bade tabake ko ghulaam banaaya ja saktaa he
 It is not about a bank
 kai bainkon ke logon ne mujhe likhaa he
 i read the orders of the two banks today
 aantarik patr he
 i am not giving name ek bank ke ek aadesh main likhaa he ki "bank ke siio, prabandh nideshak se lekar teenon kaaryakari nideshak tak haath jodakar apil karte hai ki apni sanstha ko bachaane ke liye pleez share khariden
 We have 54 zones but satisfactory progress has not been made
 " bainkon ke zone ko target diya gaya he ki itane karod tak kaa share khreeden
 Even union leaders have appealed to buy shares
 grad 1 se 4 tak ke adhikariyon se kaha gaya he ki ve dhai lakh tak ke share khreeden
 The clerk has been asked to buy up to one and a half lakh shares
 is skim kaa naam impalai stock parchez skim (esps)he
 The price of one share of the bank is 80 rupees
 kab hogi aam aadmi ke mudde par raajnneeti?maine aadesh kii copy dekhi he
 Managers who refuse to buy shares are being transferred
 ek duusare bank ke aadesh patr se pataa chalata he ki bainkon ke karmchaariyon ke di-mat acount khulwaaye ja rahe hai
 Video conferencing is being done on how to open a demat account
 jinke hai, unhen sakriy rakhane ko kaha ja rahaa he taaki share transfar kaa kaam bijli kii gati se ho sake
 The order of this bank states that the bank is going to deposit capital for itself by issuing shares to employees
 sabhi karmchaariyon se ummid kii ja rahi he ki ve di-mat acount kholen
 It is even written that before leaving the office in the evening, all branches should confirm whether a D-MAT account is opened or not
 bataaiye kya garima rah gai in bankeron kii?aadhe daam main aayaat ho saktaa he to dugani laagat par uria kaa utpaadan kyunye sabhi sarkari bank hai
 Bankers have reported that they are being forced
 kaha ja rahaa he ki paise nahin hai to over-draft karen
 He has to pay interest
 phir us paise se bank ke paise khreeden taaki bank ke paas puunji aa jaae
 This is an amazing idea
 is desh main tivi par rashtrawaad chal rahaa he or daftaron main insaan kii garima kuchli ja rahi he
 a citizen does not even have the option to buy shares
 kya sebi yaa koi niamak sansthaaen mar gayi hai? kya bankeron ne apni naagarikta bilkul kho di he ki isamen unhen kuch bhi galat nahin lagata? apane rishtedaaron ko bataa sakate the, vipaksh ke netaaon tak baaten pahunchaa sakate the ki hamaare saath ho rahaa he, patrakaron ko bataa sakate the, aakhir chup kaise rah gaye? kya bainkon ke bheetar kaam karne vaale itani si baat nahin samajhe ki series se unka koon khinchaa ja rahaa he? phir banker baar-baar bees lakh banker bees lakh banker parivaar kyon karte hai?dilli waalon, keval i se itanagar nahin hota, itanagar main insaan bhi hote hanupar se arthvyavastha kitna chamak rahi he
 Bankers are also the victims of this glow
 unamem se bhi bahut honge jinhen ye galat nahin lagata hoga
 If your relatives are in government banks, ask them if this happened to you? Have you been forced to buy shares by taking loans from the bank? At least you ask them this question and give them a chance to tell
 unhen khud ko zindaa naagarik samajhane kaa mauka den
 This means that who is buying shares in the market is also a scam
 bankeron ko majaboor karnaa bhi ghotaalaa he
 Buy the shares you want to buy in the market
 magar bank kaise majaboor kar saktaa he ki aap hamaara share dhai lakh kaa khreeden hi
 In this way, the annual report is being corrected by pulling the shares of one lakh and one lakh from each employee like blood from the syringes
 chit fund ghotaalaa peediton ko raahat ke liye koi kaanoon kyon nahin bana?maine bank series kii shuruyaat main hi or shaayad pichley saal isi vakt likhaa tha ki bainkon ke bheetar gulaami chal rahi he
 It was then that i was wrong
 main koun sa samajashastri hum
 How did you say such a big thing that slavery is going on in banks
 lekin ab main ise hote hue dekh rahaa hum
 If bankers can be slaves, what will be the condition of the rest
 sochie aaj bankeron ke liye koi nahin he
 Bankers are also not their own
 jab manushya manushya nahin rah jaataa to sab ek-duusare kii peeth kii chamadi udhedane lagate hai
 Blood is flowing from your back, but the foreskin is covering the back skin
 aarthik nitiyon kaa yah daur hamase kitni keemat maang rahaa he
 Now it seems that if there was no propaganda on the channels, then where would these people go to reduce their pain
 mare hue manushyon or adhamare nagarikon ke bich rashtrawaad or sampradayikta kaa injection kaam kar gaya he
 They would be proud at least in the evening
 unke jivan main bhale gaurav na bachaa ho magar tivi ke zarie studio ke set main badal die gaye bharat ko dekhakar achambhit ho uthte honge
 Must be proud bees lakh bankers shunya main badal chuke hai
 They are numb
 ham unka haal jaanakar sann rah gaye hai

 sahaayak police adheekshak (aparaadh) arun pandey ne kaha ki abhibhavakon kii shikaayat kii jaanch kii jaaegi or agar aarope sahi paae gaye to karrwai kii jaaegi
 The history of the examination is old
 puraanon se lekar 2015 tak sabane koi na koi pariksha jarur di he
 But there is also an exam that everyone has passed in this period
 english culture or skool-college yug main ise exam naam se janaa jaataa he
 On hearing the exam name, many souls get out of the body and enter the blanket in the cupboard
 aage jaaniye aisi hi 10 baaten, jo exam se pehle har kisi ke saath hoti hai
 1
 neend bahut aati he:acchhee sehat ke liye neend behad jaruri hoti he
 If you ever realize this the most, then it is the pre-exam phase
 exam kii detshit aate hi neend or ubaasi students ko gher leti he
 Yes, nerdy type children are the exception in this case
 2
 Pass this time God: Children who have papers before the exam
 unhen agar sabase zyada kisi kii yaad aati he to wo he khuda
 Almost every student definitely wishes that God, pass this time before God
 agali baar se pakkaa padhai par dhyaan duungaa
 3
 tabiyat kharaab:aaj kal sab kuch milawat vaala aa rahaa he or is milavati or junk food kaa agar kabhi sabase zyada asar hota he to wo he exam time
 Those who have not studied for the whole year, they are seen touching their foreheads to every other person in the exam time, saying that i have to see if i have a fever
 4
 If the man would have read it earlier: When you sit reading and understand something, but time is short, then every student's voice comes from a liver that if the man had read it earlier, he would have easily passed and brought more numbers
 
 5
 Forgotten everything, don't remember anything now: Take the box of your memories and see, if you are a meritorious type student and sitting for revision just before the exam, then you find yourself forgotten
 shaayad isi bhuulane kii prakriya ko objarv karke gazani film main shortterm memri los kaa concept rakhaa gaya tha
 6
 jai totaka tantra mantra:koi mere kiye ko kaat de to paise waapas
 If anyone takes this line most serially, then they are scared and superstitious students in the exam phase
 dahi khaanaa, gaay ko khaas khilaanaa, saanp ko doodh pilaanaa jaise kaam isi tantra sadhana ke tahat kiye jate hai
 7
 bache hue saare kaam yaad aate hai:exam se thik pehle saalon se pending pade kaam yaad aane lagate hai
 a relative has been calling for years but his feelings are respected in the exam phase, when we say to the mother, aunt has been calling for so many months
 mummy ho aauun kya
 8
 nots photo state:puure saal class main baithkar 16 parchi dhapp yaa baton main gujaarne ke baad exam se pehle har student ko ye yaad aata he ki paas hone ke liye nots jugad kar liye jaaen
 Now at the time of the exam, no one will give notes, so Xerox aka Photo is taken to the State's shelter
 9
 Dude, how much your preparation is: what we did does not matter
 doosraa is vakt kya kar rahaa he, ye jaruri he
 So before the exam every student friend has not read much, he asks the friend to satisfy him, friend, how ready is your friend
 10
 Roam, it is also important to watch the film, man: If you pay attention when you look at the datesheet of the exam, it is a map
 pasand kii jagahon par jane kii tamanna kii jad par jaise koi pani seench detaa he
 Watching National Award-winning films and inspiring films seems to be part of the syllabus

 aarope lage the ki kaarykram ke dauraan kathith rup se desh virdohi naare lagaae gayi
 Earlier, social activist and lawyer Prashant Bhushan had accused the BJP government of creating an atmosphere of fear in the country, saying that people speaking against the government were being targeted

 " yah vaada kiya he bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne, jo bihar industries association kii baithak main kaarobaariyon ko tasalli dete hue bol rahe the
 Nitish Kumar made it clear that businessmen should not be afraid, should invest, because the law will work on such people (don), and no don will be left out
 mukhyamantri ke is vaade ke baad mana ja rahaa he ki nitish kumaar ne faisla kar liya he ki kisi bhi dal kaa kitna bhi prabhaavshaalee netaa kyon na ho, apradhi hone par use jail main hi rahanaa padegaa
 Some consider it a danger bell for former Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) MP Mohammad Shahabuddin
 tippaniyan On Monday, the state government was reprimanded by the Supreme Court over Mohammad Shahabuddin's petition to revoke the bail, and said that when the Patna High Court granted Shahabuddin bail, the state government appealed against him
 Why did not appear in the early filing
 or ab nitish kumaar ke is bayaan ko isi fatkaar se jodakar dekha ja rahaa he
 It is believed that Nitish is trying to prove from his statement that the state government is not going to be soft on people of criminal background

 After the Chief Minister's promise, it is believed that Nitish Kumar has decided that no matter how effective the leader of any party is, he will have to remain in jail if he is a criminal

 british filmkaar lesley udwin kaa kahana he ki bharat sarkaar ko unki documentry film 'indiaj doter' par pratibandh lagane ke liye shame se apana sir jhukaa lenaa chahie
 Nirbhaya's friend claims, 'india's Daughter' is a false story
 The Indian government has banned Udwin's documentary film 'india's Daughter', a brutal incident of gang rape and assault of a 23-year-old girl in Delhi on 16 December 2012

 There is speculation that the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) is behind the transfer in the Ministry of Power of Financial Affairs Secretary Subhash Chandra Garg
 ab pradhanmantri karyaalay (piemo) kii ore se vittamantri ko videshi sovrain bond par dobaaraa vichaar karte hue purv bankeron or arthshaastriyon dwaara is sambandh main uthaae gaye masalon kii jaanch karne ko kaha gaya he
 The PMO has said that the final decision should be taken to implement the budget proposal only after examining the issues raised in this regard by the former bankers and economists
 sutron ke mutabik, piemo ne kaha ki vitt mantri ko kisi yojana par aage badhane se pehle hitdharakon se paraamarsh karnaa chahie
 Significantly, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had announced in her budget of July 5 that loans from abroad will be taken through sovereign bonds to raise the amount of millions of crores required for infrastructure development schemes
 lekin rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (RSS) se judi sanstha swadeshi jaagran manch ne videshi karj lene ke modi sarkaar ke prastaav kaa virodh karte hue ise raashtra hit ke khilaaf bataaya
 Now what will be the target of sovereign bonds? Finance Ministry officials had said that the government proposed 7 through sovereign bonds
 1 lakh karod rupee udhari kaa kareeb 10-15 fisadi is vitt varsh main juta sakati he
 But after the order of PMO, nothing is clear on what will happen to this target
 kaha ja rahaa he ki is prastaavit bond ke peeche dimag purv vitt sachiv subhash chandra garg kaa hi he
 However, Krishnamurthy Subramanian, the Chief Economic Advisor, also said that there is a good chance that India should raise debt at a much cheaper rate than foreign sovereign bonds
 garg kaa tabadalaa urja mantralay main ho gaya he
 An ambitious target of investing Rs 100 lakh crore in infrastructure over the next five years has been set to make the country a $ 5 trillion economy
 bajet main vitt mantri ne videsh se karj or anya tareeke se dhan jutaney kii baat kahi he
 The government had indicated that the first sovereign bond would be issued in the second half of this financial year
 swadeshi jaagran manch kyon kar rahaa virodhswadeshi jaagran manch ke sah-sanyojak aswani mahajan ne bajet ke do din baad kaha tha, 'videshi mudra main sarkari karj lenaa galat vichaar he or is sambandh main antarrashtriya anubhav kaaphi bhayankar rahe hai
 They are so caught up in the foreign debt trap that sovereigns are now taking more loans to avoid default
 ' mahajan ne indonesia, brazil, argentina, turki or mexico kaa udhaaharan diya he
 Foreign debt of these countries is 53 of GDP
 8 fisadi tak pahunch gaya he
 What happens Sovereign bondbonds are a means of providing assured returns through which companies or governments raise debt
 jo bond kharidta he vah ek tarah se sarkaar yaa company ko karj de rahaa hota he or use iske badale ek nishchit samay main mooldhan ke saath ek nishchit ritern dene kaa vaayada kiya jaataa he
 In this way, by issuing sovereign bonds abroad, the government has a plan to raise funds and invest that money in development
 baad main macurity par yah paisa sood ke saath waapas kiya jayega
 (with input from agencies) pradhanmantri narendra modi kehete hai ki bharat varsh main kheti ke baad agar koi doosraa bada rojgaar kaa sector he to wo he textile industry or usamen bhi banaras iskaa bada kendra sadiyon se rahaa he
 But the Banarasi textile industry has been ill for the last several years
 har bajet main isko lekar chintaa vyakt kii jaati he or ise thik karne ke liye bade-bade package kaa elaan bhi hota he, par ye rupaya kahaan jaataa he khud bunakaron ko nahin pataa kyonki unki ye bimaari lagaataar badhati ja rahi he
 This is the reason why in this budget, now the weavers and the people of Banarasi textile industry do not beg for money but want raw materials and markets associated with this workmanship at cheap rates so that they can stand on their own feet
 pradhanmantri narendra modi beete maheene banaras aae the tab unhone bunakaron ke liye lalpur main trade fecilitate centre kaa udghaatan kiya or us samay kaha ki bharat kii aisi koi bhi stri garib se garib or amir se amir nahin hogi jisane banarsi sari kaa naam nahin suna hoga or koi bhi aisi mahila nahin hogi jo apni beti kii shaadi main ek banarsi sari na dena chaahe
 ' pradhanmantri narendra modi banarsi sari kii jo baat bataa rahe hai ye uske khud kii samaaj ke aakhri paaydaan tak pahunchane ke rasookh kii kahani he
 The workmanship that ruled the textile world for centuries has been ill for many years and now even counting its last breaths
 ise thik karne ke liye pichhali kai sarkaron ne bade-bade vaade kiye, tamaam upaay kiye, karodon rupee bhi die
 But where did the money go, Varanasi textile industry itself does not know
 varanasi vastra udyog ke secretary rajan bahal bataate hai, 'pichhali sarkaar ne 3 hazaar karod rupee bunakaron ke qarz maafi ke liye diya tha
 What breakup happened to us, we still do not understand
 jitne difolter the unako laabh mila jo eemaandaar the unako koi laabh nahin mila
 ' gauratlab he kii banarsi sari kaa desh hi nahin balki videshon main bhi bada bazaar he
 This business is about 1 thousand crores, of which 300 to 400 crores is exported every year
 kabhi ye aankada isse kai guna zyaada tha
 Because then the raw material associated with it was made only in Benaras and many parts of the country
 lekin aaj haalat ye he ki china se yarn aane laga he
 The big irony on this is that the government is levying 25 per cent tax on raw material Chinese yarn, while the finished goods made from this yarn which are coming from China are only taxing 10 per cent which is destroying the industry here
 is
 yahi haul polister, nylon, coton, marsraiced, viscorse jaise desh main banane vaale dhaagon kaa he
 The weaver, whose debt is never able to recover, so now he does not want money from the government, but he wants this thread at cheap rates
 bunakar mo
 Hamid Ansari further clarifies, "we do not get the money that comes in our name, the officer who pains the leader makes monkeys, we get upset and sit down
" ab sarkaar se yahi aashaa he ki hamako tex kam karke resham uplabdh karaae jisase ham sasta se sasta maal banaaen or hamen bazaar uplabdh karaae jisase ham apana maal bech saken
 We will no longer begging with a bowl
 ' Mo
 hamid ansaari jis dhaage kii baat kar rahe hai wo dhaage kabhi banaras main hi banate the lekin ye industry aaj khatm ho gai he
 Only 5% of the work of brocade is left
 in khatm ho rahe udyog ke liye sarkaar ne kai yojanaayen banaain
 There are co-operative societies to clusters in it, but what is their status you can understand from these figures
 banaras main taqariban 600 sosayadi hai par isamen bamushkil 60 hi thik tareeke se kaam kar rahi hai
 There are about 30 government clusters and 1 mega cluster, whose common weavers are not getting any benefit
 lihaaja ab ye log sarkaar se is tarah kii koi yojana nahin balki iske bazaar or prachaar prasar main sahyog chaahate hai
 Varanasi textile industry secretary Rajan Bahl explains something like this, 'in this budget, custom duty free silk and a fund should be created to promote Banarasi sarees, like we say Sunday or eggs, or eggs eaten everyday, or Heera is always, this should be such propaganda

 He has been involved in more than 15 rounds of talks on the border dispute between 2003 and 2013, when he retired
 in 10 varshon main daai chaar alag-alag vishesh bhartiya pratinidhiyon se baatcheet kar chuke hai
 He never spoke publicly about their conversation, but his book Strategic Dialogues, which appeared in Beijing in late April (in Chinese), describes for the first time China's view on confidential talks
 daai khulaasa karte haih* vaajapeyi or unke rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar (enese) brajesh mishra 2003 main “jaldi kisi samjhaute” ke liye behad utsuk the

 * In the eyes of China, the Congress was less likely to find a solution with the government, as it had "historical experience" associated with the border dispute
 * donon hi pakshon ne yathasthiti vaale samaadhaan ko khaarij kar diya tha
 The final solution will come only when India and China "reconcile" - China leaves some areas in Aksai Chin and India in Arunachal Pradesh in the east
 maukey jo chook gaye2003 main tatkaaleen chini pradhanmantri wain jiyabaao kii ore se niyukt daai ne baatcheet main jaan foonkane ke liye vaajapeyi sarkaar ko shrey diya he, varanaa is tarah kii uddeshyheen baatcheet varshon se chalati aa rahi thi
 During a dinner with Wen during his visit to China in 2003, Vajpayee suggested making arrangements for a special representative
 unhone sujhaayaa tha ki pratinidhiyon ko “seemaa vivaad par maujuuda baatcheet se khud ko alag karne ke liye protsaahit kiya jaae, “ve apane-apane pradhanmantri ko sidhe report karen” or “rajnatik str par” samaadhaan nikaalen
 In the eyes of China, Vajpayee was the "first Indian Prime Minister to publicly state that both sides needed to make some compromises
" ” daai kehete hai, isaki vajah se “seemaa vivaad kii sust baatcheet main ek nai ummid jag gai
 "india's first NSA and Special Representative Brajesh Mishra, who died in 2012, left a deep impact on China's Special Representative
 daai mishra ko “duusare bhartiya kutanyikon se ekadam ulat” bataate hai
 When Dai suggested in the first such meeting of the two countries that both sides should aim to achieve a solution "in three to five years", then 75-year-old Mishra said clearly in response: "if this work has so many It takes years
 
 
 to ise dekhne ke liye main nahin rahoonga
 After the second round of negotiations were over, Mishra quietly took Dai to an edge and asked him to convey a message to the Chinese leadership
 daai yaad karte hai, “unhone kaha, pradhanmantri vaajapeyi 79 saal ke hai or ve seemaa ke sawaal par behad gambhir hai
 Mishra himself was 75 years old, and he hoped to resolve the issue as soon as possible
 ” 2004 ke madhya main bijepi jab chunaav main lag gai to mishra ne daai ko bataaya ki sarkaar kii yojana “vishesh pratinidhiyon kii baithkon kii pragati ko tej” karne kii thi, or vah chunaavon ke baad jaldi hi kisi samjhaute par pahunchnaa chaahati thi
 Dai believes that these were not just words from his side, and soon a compromise was truly possible
 ve likhte hai, “mujhe ummid thi ki baithkon se jaldi hi koi nateeja hasil hoga
 Big turn but it did not happen
 daai kaa kahana he ki 2004 kaa chunaav ek bada mode tha
 The Congress-led UPA was a "weak government with coalition partners", and "had its own limitations and limited ability to take decisions for many reasons
" ” mishra pad se hat gaye or phir koi samaadhaan nikaalane ke vishay se dhyaan hat gaya
 China felt that the government was paying more attention to its domestic issues and was "trying to maintain stability at the center
" ” daai kehete hai, “usamen seemaa ke mudde ko hal karne kii jaldi kaa bhav nahin tha” jisase mishra kii sari koshishen bekaar ho gayi
 These hopes were revived for some time when the UPA came to power again in 2009, stronger than before

 narayanan vishesh pratinidhi ban gaye the
 Says Dai, Narayanan "gave me a message on behalf of the Indian government saying that India hopes to solve all the problems between the two countries in three-four years
" ” daai ne narayanan, jinke saath ve aath baithken kar chuke the, ko bataaya ki “ham shaayad 99veen baithak tak baatcheet nahin chalaa paaenge
 Dai held his last round of talks in 2012 with Shivshankar Menon, who was India's NSA and Special Representative until May 2014
 beijing main nayaa netritv aane ke baad daai apane pad se hat gaye the
 In December 2014, Dai and Menon — who had stepped down from the post of NSA and Special Representative by the time the May 2014 elections — met at a special event interacting with Peking University students
 dilli main nai sarkaar ke chah maheene ho jane-or beijing main shi jinping kii nai sarkaar ke dedh saal puure hone-ke baad donon purv vishesh pratinidhiyon ne bharosa jataayaa ki “donon deshon main majboot janadesh vaali sarkarein” hone se ab koi samaadhaan sambhav ho saktaa he
 Menon suggested in the meeting that most of the technical work had been completed, now only political will was needed
 unhone 2015 main apane ek intervyuu main is bare main vistaar se bataaya tha
 He had said, "whatever technical work we had to do, we had done" and by 2012 he and Daei had brought the conversation "to the point where it could be accomplished through the political will of both countries
" ” unhone radiff ko bataaya, “hamaare liye yah ek bada kaam he kyonki iskaa matlab he ki hamen apane us soch ko badalanaa he jo hamane apane skulon main bharat ke nakshe ko banaate hue siikhaa he
 You cannot achieve 100 per cent of things according to your mind in any agreement
 
 
 isi tarah china ke logon ko bhi apane skulon main siikhe gaye china ke nakshe ko badalane ke liye taiyaar rahanaa hoga
 An agreement means something to be taken for granted
 yahi to talmail he
 Dai expresses similar opinions
 vishesh pratinidhi ke taur par apane aakhri daur ke baad ve menon ke saath apni anaupchaarik mulaakaat ko yaad karte hai, jisamen donon pakshon ne 15 baar se bhi zyada kii baatcheet kii pragati ke bare main bataaya
 By 2012, Dai says, the two sides "had prepared a good situation for the final settlement of the border dispute and put forward a three-phase plan
 isamen se pehla charan, jisamen rajnatik mandandon par raji hona shaamil tha, 2005 main puraa ho chukaa tha
 If the most difficult task was to draw an outline in the second stage, the last step was to draw the boundary lines in the map
 daai kehete hai ki donon paksh is par sahamat ho gaye the ki iske liye “sarthak or paraspar sweekaarya talmail” kii jarurat hogi
 He believes that both sides "need to have a sense of hurry" and that "the right time" is for progress on the negotiation of the existing opportunity limits
 ve paroksh rup se yah baat kahana chhod gaye ki kya iskaa kaaran yah tha ki centre main majboot janadesh vaali gaiyr-congressi sarkaar thi, jabaki shi ke paas apane purvavartiyon ke mukaable zyada shakti thi, visheshkar sena par
 Dai says that the biggest hurdle is to deal with public sentiments, because in both countries the idea of leaving their territory is a very sensitive issue
 lekin kya is baadha ko kabhi paar kiya ja saktaa he? 13 saal ho jane ke baad bhi is sawaal kaa jawaab dena sabase kathin he

 On the other hand, various media reports and social media are speculating about the disease
 irfan kii beemaari ko lekar unke manager or duusare karibiyon ne koi pratikriya dene se manaa kar diya he
 The way social networks are speculating about the disease, the trade analyst and Komal Nahata, close to Irfan, have dismissed it
 unhone afvaah na failaane kii baat bhi kahi he
 Even today, it is trying to gather the right information about Irfan's health from his sources
 kokilaben hospital ke adhikariyon ne samachar agency pitiai se kaha he, irfan khan ilaaj ke liye hamaare aspataal main bhartee nahin hai
 Irfan's team has also denied reports that he is admitted to Kokilaben Hospital for treatment
 irfan-deepika hue biimaar, tali vishaal bharadwaj ke film kii shootingkomal nahata ne kya likhaa?komal nahata ne apane twitor par likhaa, irfan khan biimaar hai, lekin pichley ek-do ghante se unke bare main jo khabaren aa rahi hai, vah mahaj afvaah he
 The news of his hospitalization is absolutely false
 bhagwaan kii krupa se irfan dilli main hai or yahi sach he
 Although irrfankhan is unwell, all malicious news being spread about him and his condition since an hour or two are untrue
 Likewise, all other horrendous news relating to his hospitalisation are fake
 By God's grace, Irrfan is in Delhi and that's the only truth
 — Komal Nahta (@komalnahta)march 6, 2018sabase pehle kaise baahar ai beemaari kii khabarirfan ne khud post karke apane phens ko beemaari ke bare main jaankaree di thi
 He said, sometimes you wake up with such a shock as if life seems to have shaken you

 It is proving difficult for the BJP, which has announced the cutting of tickets for the old councilors in the MCD election
 party ne tikat kii chahat rakhane vaale ummidavaaron ko somvaar tak biodata jamaa karwaane ko kaha tha
 But most of the leaders are presenting the relationship with the Sangh by exaggerating more than serving the public in the bio-data
 sangham sharanam gachhamidilli kaa kaam dekh rahe bijepi ke padaadhikari tikat ke daavedaaron ke sangh conection ke kisse sunne ko majaboor hai
 In almost every bio-data, there is a reference to the old association with the RSS or some kind of family association
 apane-apane daweybiodata main ek tikat daavedaar ne likhaa he ki unke pita sangh ke swayamsevak rahe hai or wo khud bhi shakha main jaaya karte the
 Another claimant says that his father was associated with the Sangh in Madhya Pradesh and his father did the work of starting a Sangh in a district there
 isi tarah tikat ke liye qatari main lage ek anya netaa ne khud ko bachapan se hi sangh se judaa hua bataaya he
 Connection with Jana Sangh too! Some contenders are seen to be adding a connection to the era of Bharatiya Jan Sangh
 aise netaa aresas or jansangh ke alaava vishwa hindu parishad se bhi pushtaini rishte hone kaa dam bhar rahe hai
 a senior BJP leader admitted that ever since the Modi government came in, most people have been searching for their old relationship with the Sangh
 unhone kaha ki aise log bhi jo pehle sangh se apana naata chhipate the, wo bhi ab har maukey par khud ko sangh se kisi na kisi tarah judaa dikhaane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 The party's Delhi unit has so far received about 19 thousand biodata
 inaki jaanch hona baaki he
 The firing incident has come to light outside the headquarters of the US National Security Agency

 Former PM Indira Gandhi has also described Savarkar as great; 10 years of black water was punished; Savarkar has once again started the ideological brainstorming in the country with Navinayak Damodar Savarkar
 dakshinpanthi raajnneetik varg saavarkar ko bharat ratna dilaane ke liye maahaul banane main laga he, to yah masalaa congress ke liye gale kii haddi ban gaya he, kyonki maharashtra chunaav ke vakt vah vir saavarkar kaa virodh karne kaa jokhim nahin le sakati
 Anyway, the fact is that former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi has also called Savarkar great
 lekin vir saavarkar ko kathith mukhyadhara kaa senaanee nahin mana gaya or unke yogadan ko lekar kaaphi vivaad rahaa he
 After all, what are the arguments of those who proclaim Savarkar the 'bharat Ratna' and call him great and what are the arguments of those who criticize Veer Savarkar? Let's know
 kya hai mahanata ke kaaryaveer saavarkar kii mahanata ke bare main tamaam kitaaben likhi gai hai, dakshinpanthi media main kai tarah kii jaankariyaan hai
 Apart from this, the mainstream media also has a lot of information about the country and their contribution in the freedom struggle
 inke mutabik, vir saavarkar bhartiya swatantraaa aandolan ke agrim pankti ke senaanee or prakhar rashtravaadi netaa the
 He was not only a fiery fighter of the freedom struggle, but also a revolutionary, thinker, writer, poet, brilliant orator and visionary politician
 unhone 1857 ke pratham swatantraaa sangram kaa sansanikhej va khojpurn itihaas likhakar british shashan ko hilaa kar rakh diya tha
 In the book 'the Indian War of Independence-1857' written in 1909, Savarkar declared this fight as the first war of independence against the British government
 unka janm 28 may, 1883 ko maharashtra ke nasik main ek marathi parivaar main hua tha
 He was also a lawyer, politician, poet, writer and dramatist
 saavarkar kabhi bhi aresas or jansangh se nahin jude rahe, lekin unki in donon sanghathanon or vichaar se jude ke logon main kaaphi izzat he
 In the year 2000, the Vajpayee Government of the then President
 aar
 Narayanan had been sent a proposal to award 'bharat Ratna', India's highest civilian honor to Veer Savarkar, but he did not accept it
 apni ucch madhyamik shiksha ke dauraan british raaj se bharat ko swatantrat karaane kii jigyaasa saavarkar main jaagrit hui, unhone bharat main swadeshi andolan ko badhaava diya, saath hi apane saathiyon ko bhi swatantraaa andolan main shaamil hone ke liye prerit kiya
 The Bharatiya Jana Sangh website claimed that Savarkar was the first freedom fighter and politician who lit Holi in foreign clothes
 1905 ke bang-bhang ke baad unhone pune main videshi vastron kii holi jalaai thi
 On 7 April 1911, Savarkar was sent to the Cellular Jail in Andaman Island for the freedom movement for the Nashik Conspiracy Case for the murder of Jackson, the collector of Kala Pani district, for the freedom movement
 is jail main kaidiyon ko kolhu main bail kii tarah jot diya jaataa tha
 Savarkar remained in the prison at Port Blair from July 4, 1911 to May 21, 1921
 andaman ke ekant karawas main jail kii deevaaron par keel or koyale se kavitaayen likhin or phir unhen yaad kiya
 In this way, he rewrote the 10 thousand lines memorized after being released from jail
 unhone apane karawas ke dinon main 'da transportesan of maai life' naamak pustak likhi
 The British confiscated two of his books before they were printed and published
 bharat kii swatantrata ke liye sangharshrat rahane ke kaaran unhen ek bhartiya vishvavidhyalay kii apni oopaadhi se vanchit hona padaa
 Not only this, he was not conferred with the title of barrister due to his refusal to take oath of diplomacy
 unhone yah ghoshnaa kii ki sampurna raajnneetik swatantraaa hi bharat kaa dhyey he
 To work for independence, he formed a secret society, known as 'mitra Mela'
 baad main yah 'abhinav bharat socity' naamak sanghathan main badal gaya
 Even while studying at Fergusson College, Pune, he used to give vigorous speeches full of patriotism
 apane raajnneetik vichaaron ke liye saavarkar ko pune ke is kalege se nishkasit kar diya gaya tha
 In 1906, on the recommendation of Tilak, he received the Shyamji Krishna Varma Scholarship and went to London
 vahaan bhi unhone swatantraaa andolan ke liye alakh jagaae rakhi
 He wrote several articles in 'indian Sociologist' and 'talwar', which also appeared in Kolkata's 'yugantar'
 saal 1910 main unhen nasik ke colector kii hatya main sanlipt hone ke aarope main landan main giraftaar kar liya gaya tha
 Savarkar's brother was first arrested in 1910 on the murder of Nashik district collector Jackson
 ve roosi krantikariyon se zyada prabhavit the
 While in London, Savarkar met Lala Hardayal
 landan main ve india house kii dekharekh bhi karte the
 After the execution of Madan Lal Dhingra, he also wrote an article in the 'london Times'
 unhone dhingra ke likhit bayaan ke parche bhi baante the
 Great credit goes to Savarkar for developing the political ideology (hindutva) of Hindutva pioneers
 asal main saavarkar ne ek pustak likhi thi, 'hindutv - hu iz hindu?' jisamen unhone pehali baar hindutv ko ek raajnneetik vichaardhaara ke taur par istemaal kiya
 Savarkar and his party started gaining in the national political environment due to the growing popularity of the Muslim League under the leadership of Muhammad Ali Jinnah
 vir saavarkar bombai (ab mumbai) chale gaye or 1937 main hindu mahasabha ke adhyaksh chune gaye or 1943 tak seva kii
 The Congress entered elections in 1937 but the conflict between the Congress and Jinnah increased the hindu-muslim political divide
 jab congress ne 1942 main bharat chodo andolan shuru kiya, saavarkar ne isaki aalochana kii or hinduon se yuddh ke prayaas main sakriy rahane ke liye kaha or sarkaar kii avagya nahin kii, unhone hinduon se aagrah kiya ki ve 'yuddh kii kala' seekhney ke liye sashastr balon main shaamil hon
 In 1944, activists of the Hindu Mahasabha opposed Gandhi's initiative to hold talks with Jinnah
 vir saavarkar ke netritv main hindu mahasabha ne bharat chodo andolan kaa khuleam virodh kiya or aadhikarik taur par iskaa bahishkaar kiya
 Balmukund Pandey, national organization secretary of All India History Collection Scheme, an rss-linked organization, when he got the title of Veer, said, "in 1936, a prominent filmmaker and historian of Maharashtra, PK Atre, first established Savarkar in history under the name 'swatantrya Veer Savarkar' 
 us samay congress ne saavarkar ke khilaaf bada andolan kiya tha
 Bal Mohan Theater Company staged the drama 'swatantrya Veer Savarkar' after which he came to be called 'swatantrya Veer Savarkar'
 ’kai sroton ke mutabik, ' yah 1936 kaa samay tha
 After getting embroiled in controversy over a statement, Savarkar was blacklisted by the Congress and he was opposed everywhere
 aise main mashhoor patrkaar, shikshavid, lekhak, kavi or naatak va film kalakaar pike atre ne saavarkar kaa saath dene kaa man banaaya kyonki vah unke bade prashansak the
 Atre organized a reception for Savarkar as part of his Balmohan Theater program in Pune
 is kaarykram ko lekar congress ke kaaryakartaaon ne saavarkar ke khilaaf parche baante or dhamkee di ki ve saavarkar ko kaale jhande dikhaaenge
 Despite this protest, thousands gathered and Savarkar's reception program was concluded
 saavarkar ke virodh main congressi kaaryakarta kaarykram sthal ke baahar hangaamaa kar rahe the
 In his speech at the program, Atre described Savarkar as fearless and said that black flags will not scare the man who did not fear even the punishment of black water
 iske saath hi, atre ne saavarkar ko 'swatantryavir' kii oopaadhi di
 This title was later titled simply 'veer' and was associated with Savarkar's name
 haalanki kai aalochak yah bhi kehete hai ki saavarkar ne ek kitaab ke madhyam se khud hi apane ko 'vir' ghoshit kiya tha
 He died on 26 February 1966
 vir saavarkar ke bare main kya kehete hai aalochakavir saavarkar kii chhavi ko sabase zyada nuksaan pahunchane vaala aarope tha gandhi hatya kii yojana main unke shaamil hone ko lekar
 a case was filed against him in the Gandhi murder case
 aalochak kehete hai ki wo chhot jarur gaye the, lekin unke jivan kaal main hi uski jaanch ke liye kapur ayog baitha tha or uski report main shaq kii sui saavarkar se hati nahin thi
 Veer Savarkar's image came as a shock when he was arrested along with eight people for his involvement in the Gandhi massacre in 1949
 haalanki, thos sabooton ke abhaav main wo bari ho gaye
 Savarkar went to jail in this case, then got released and remained alive till 1966, but the charge was related to his personality
 kapur kamishan kii report main kaha gaya ki 'unhen is baat kaa yakeen nahin he ki saavarkar kii jaankaree ke bina gandhi hatyakand ho saktaa tha
 'serious Accusation of Apologizing to the British a serious charge is also leveled against Veer Savarkar that he once apologized to the British during the independence movement
 andaman kii cellular jail main halaat bhayaavah the
 The way the animals are plowed in the crusher, Savarkar was employed in the oil mill in the same way
 yah barbar sajaa thi
 However, he was not the only person employed in this work
 1911 main unhone khud hi sarkaar ke saamne dayaa yachika laga di
 Later Savarkar himself and his supporters had justified their apology to the British on the grounds that it was part of their strategy, due to which they could get some concessions
 vir saavarkar ne apni aatmakatha main likhaa tha, 'agar maine jail main hadtaal kii hoti to mujhase mukhya bhoomi bharat patr bhejne kaa adhikaar chin liya jaataa
 In the year 1924, Savarkar was released from Yerwada jail in Pune on the basis of 2 conditions
 ye sharten thim – saavarkar ko ratnagiri jile main hi rahanaa hoga or bina sarkari anumati ke ve jile se baahar nahin ja sakate, ve nijee yaa saarvajanik rup se raajnneetik gatividhiyon main bhaag nahin le sakate
 These conditions were for five years and could be imposed again after this time period
 chhattisgarh ke mukhyamantri bhupesh baghel ne ek bayaan main saavarkar ko do raashtra kaa siddhant dene vaala pehla netaa kaha tha
 Baghel had said, 'vinayak Damodar Savarkar, the leader of the Hindu Mahasabha, conceived a Hindu and Muslim nation based on religion
 bijaropan saavarkar ne kiya tha or use puraa karne kaa kaam jinna ne kiya
 Savarkar had said - Take care of the cow, not Pooja Smarak Prakashan, Mumbai, Chapter 1 of Part 1 and Part 2 of the book 'vigyanistha Essay'
 5 main gaay ko lekar saavarkar ke vichaar likhe hai
 The title of this chapter is 'gopalan Hawe, Gopujan Navhe', which means taking care of cow but not worship
 vir saavarkar ke is bayaan ko bhi lekar vivaad he or ise maujuuda samay ke gorakshakon ko aainaa dikhaane ke liye istemaal kiya jaataa he
 Rani Mukerji will be seen kicking, punching and slapping miscreants in her next film 'mardaani'
 vahiin, ajay devgan bhi aagaamee film 'singhm riterns' main kuch aisa hi karte najar aaenge
 But Rani says that comparing two films is wrong
 'mardaani' se purv 'singhm riterns' kii relies kya aapaki film ko prabhavit karegi? rani ne kaha, 'ajay ek bahut bade sitare hai or film kii frenchiji bhi bahut badi he
 i have seen 'singham' and i liked it
 'unhone kaha, 'hamaari film bahut choti he or yah sabhi mahilaon ke liye ek chota sa prayaas he
 'mardaani' should not be compared to 'singham Retailers', which is a very big film
 ''mardaani' 22 agast ko relies hogi, jabaki rohit shetty kii 'singhm riterns' 15 agast ko relies hone ja rahi he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi hit out at West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, saying that she boycotted meetings called by the Center to discuss the issues of the states and failed to bring change despite coming up with a call for 'parivartan' She stayed

 america ne kaha ki aatanki sanghathan lashkar-e-taiyaba utana hi khatarnaak he jitne khatarnaak taliban or alqaida hai
 The United States believes that Lashkar is working with the Taliban and al-qaeda and has asked Pakistan not to allow them to gain a foothold

 He stressed that the US is not trying to tarnish this possibility
 saath hi unhone yah bhi kaha ki afghanistan main pakistan ke sahyog ke bina sthirataa nahin aa sakati

 Rahul Gandhi said that there is growing anger among the youth due to lack of jobs

e
 Employees Provident Fund Organization in such a way that employment has increased
 20 july ko loksabhaa main avishvaas prastaav par bolte hue pradhanmantri ne rojgaar ke kai aankade die jisamen ipiefo kaa bhi aankada tha
 Now the Prime Minister has said in the Lok Sabha that 45 lakh jobs have been created in the organized sector, but when the EPFO reviewed it, it reduced the 6 lakh jobs
 kya aapako kisi mantri ne twit kar bataaya ki pradhanmantri ne 45 lakh bataa diya tha yani zyaada bataa diya tha magar ab vah kam hokar 36 lakh ho gai he
 Are you being told the correct number
 ipiefo ne nau maheenon ke aankadon kii samiksha kii he
 The accounts of the Provident Fund Organization opened between September 2017 and May 2018 have been reviewed
 har maheene kii alag alag samiksha kii gai he
 There has been a decrease of 5 percent in some months and 27 percent in some months
 kulamilaakar nau maheene kii sankhya main 12
 There has been a decrease of 4 percent
 pradhanmantri ne 45 lakh bataaya tha, jo ab 39 lakh ho gai he
 On the basis of opening of accounts in the Provident Fund Organization, can it be claimed completely that how many jobs were created
 ab ek sawaal he
 Every state has its Staff and Public Service Selection Commission
 sarkaar in aayogon se ye data public main kyon nahin detii he ki kitni vekainsee ai he, kitnon ke farm bhare gaye magar pariksha nahin hui, kitnon ko rojgaar diya gaya he
 Why did the Prime Minister not tell in the Lok Sabha how many vacancies are there in different departments of his government
 5 agast ko times of india ne loksabhaa or rajyasabha main die gaye bayanon ke aadhaar par ek report taiyaar kii thi
 There are one million jobs only in primary and secondary education

 There is 50 lakh vacancy
 anya ucch shiksha sansthaanon main 12,020 vaikency he
 In this way, the Times of India added to the statement of ministers that there were more than 24 lakh jobs
 kya pradhanmantri yaa unke vibhaagon ke mantriyon ko nahin bataanaa chahie ki 24 lakh naukariyaan kab di jaaengi
 Now search a statement in the internet
 21 march 2017 ko maanav sansaadhan mantri prakaash jhaavdekar kaa loksabhaa main bayaan he ki ek saal ke bheetar dilli vishvavidhyalay main 9000 adahak shikshakon ko permanent kiya jayega
 It is not our government's policy to keep part time

 Has Prakash Jhavadekar tweeted to you how many professors, assistant professors are vacant all over the country so that you can dream of a job

 hamane apni naukari series ke dauraan ek trend dekha he
 Policies are made in such a way that they are disputed and some court goes
 yah bhi ek kaaran he magar yahi ek kaaran nahin he
 There is a question of the life of the youth, why not the governments set up separate courts to hear the cases of jobs
 yah bhi kai maamalon main hamane dekha he ki court ne aadesh de diya he ki inaki bahaali kii jaae magar uske baad bhi bahaali nahin hoti he
 Indian Railways has a vacancy of over two lakh 34 thousand
 jo bahaali ho rahi he wo dedh lakh ke aas-paas kii he

 Right now we have not told you by adding decreasing jobs in banking sector

 Talk should be clear on employment

 Now there is a question
 har rajya main karmchaaree or lokseva chayan ayog he
 Why doesn't the government give these data from these commissions to the public, how many vacancies have come, how many forms have been filled but the examination has not been done, some have been given employment
 pradhanmantri ne hi loksabhaa main kyon nahin bataaya ki unki sarkaar ke alag alag vibhaagon main kitni vaikensiyaan hai

 hamaari sarkaar kii niti part time par rakhane kii niti nahin he
 Can Prakash Jhavekar tell whether or not he has been able to administer 9000 teachers in a year
 kya prakaash jhaavdekar ne aapako twit kiya he ki desh bhar main kitne professor, sahaayak professor ke pad khaali hai taaki aap naukari kaa sapana dekh saken
 Vikas Pathak's report was published in the Hindu newspaper of 28 July
 pichley teen saal main collejon main asthaayee se lekar prophessoron kii kul sankhya main baari kami ai he
 You will be surprised to know that in three years 2 lakh 34 thousand lecturers and professors have reduced
 2015-16 main 10
 There were 09 lakh teachers which increased to 8 lakh 88 thousand in 2017-18
 ol india survey on hair ajukeshan ke aadhaar par hindu ne yah report chhaapi thi
 We have seen a trend during our job series
 nitiyaan is tarah se banati hai ki vivaadit ho jaati hai or koi na koi court chalaa jaataa he
 This is also a reason, but it is not the only reason
 naujavaanon kii zindagi kaa sawaal he kyon nahin sarkarein naukariyon ke maamalon kii sunwaayee ke liye alag se court banaati hai
 In many cases, we have seen that the court has ordered that they should be reinstated, but even then there is no restoration
 bhartiya rail ke paas do lakh 34 hazaar se adhik kii vaikency he
 The restoration that is being done is around one and a half lakhs
 bijness standard main mahesh vyas rojgaar par niyamit kalam likhte hai
 Mahesh Vyas is the director of the Center for Monitoring of Indian Economy

 Steel maker SAIL has given less work to 30,413 people
 BSNL ne 12,765 or indian oil karporation ne 11,924 logon ko apane khate se ghataya he
 Only these three government companies have reduced 55, 102 thousand jobs
 aapane mahesh vyas ko suna
 Did you know that more than 55 thousand jobs have been reduced in just three government companies
 kya aapako yah sab jaankaree hindi akhabaaron main milti he, hindi ke channelon main milti he
 Mahesh Vyas has told this data from the annual report of companies, so no one in the government can see where jobs are falling
 abhi hamane aapako banking sector main kam hoti ja rahi naukariyon ko jod kar nahin bataaya he
 Now you see this tweet
 sinthia nicksan kii he
 She is contesting from New York for the post of governor on behalf of Democrat Pati
 inhone twit kiya he ki unki mulaakaat jose naam ke is adahak professor se hui jo apana ghar chalaane ke liye tex bhi chalaate hai
 If she wins, she will increase investment in Central University of New York and State University of New York and see that no professor gets a low salary
 hamane prime time main hi kai baar bataaya he ki vahaan ke sarkari kalejon ke professor garibi rekha se neeche kaa jivan jite hai
 Till date no one has called from America and said that you have brought disrepute to America in Saharsa, Sikar, Seoni and Sirsa that the lecturers of government colleges here live below the poverty line
 tippaniyan In our university series, we showed you how you have been teaching 15-20 thousand salary on lecture contracts in government colleges in India for many years

 More than one lakh TET degree holders of UP are upset

 Will definitely show
 hamaare paas sansaadhan bahut nahin he isliye samay lag jaataa he
 In this way, the Times of India added to the statement of ministers that there were more than 24 lakh jobs
 kya pradhanmantri yaa unke vibhaagon ke mantriyon ko nahin bataanaa chahie ki 24 lakh naukariyaan kab di jaaengi
 Now search a statement in the internet
 21 march 2017 ko maanav sansaadhan mantri prakaash jhaavdekar kaa loksabhaa main bayaan he ki ek saal ke bheetar dilli vishvavidhyalay main 9000 adahak shikshakon ko permanent kiya jayega
 It is not our government's policy to keep part time
 kya prakaash jhaavdekar bataa sakate hai ki ek saal main 9000 shikshakon ko permanent kar paae hai yaa nahin
 Has Prakash Jhavadekar tweeted to you how many professors, assistant professors are vacant all over the country so that you can dream of a job

 In the last three years, there has been a huge reduction in the total number of temporary to professors in colleges

 The report was published by Hindu on the basis of All India Survey on Higher Education
 hamane apni naukari series ke dauraan ek trend dekha he
 Policies are made in such a way that they are disputed and some court goes
 yah bhi ek kaaran he magar yahi ek kaaran nahin he
 There is a question of the life of the youth, why not the governments set up separate courts to hear the cases of jobs
 yah bhi kai maamalon main hamane dekha he ki court ne aadesh de diya he ki inaki bahaali kii jaae magar uske baad bhi bahaali nahin hoti he
 Indian Railways has a vacancy of over two lakh 34 thousand
 jo bahaali ho rahi he wo dedh lakh ke aas-paas kii he
 In Business Standard, Mahesh Vyas writes regular columns on employment

 pani ke liye tarasati madhya pradesh kii janata ko pani mili na mili, lekin pani par paharaa yakeenan milegaa
 It would be surprising to hear, but this situation has actually happened in Madhya Pradesh
 kamalnath sarkaar pani kii killat se behaal janata ko pani muhaiyaa bhale hi nahin kara paae, lekin pani ke liye police vaale paharedaar jarur baitaane ja rahi he
 There is such a situation in half of Madhya Pradesh craving for water that now even the police has given the Kamal Nath government a guard
 empi ke kai hisson main jal sankat haahaakaar machaa rahaa he, kune or nalakup sookhne kii kagaar par hai, talabon main pani na ke baraabar tak pahunch gaya he or jahaan kahin thode bahut pani ke strot bache hai vahaan lambii qatari pani ko lekar tanaav kii ashanka badha rahi he
 In such a situation, the Home Minister of the Congress Government has given verbal instructions to the police officers to guard the water sources
 'ajtak' se baat karte hue grahamantri bala bachchan ne kaha ki garmi ke dinon main pani kii aapurti prabhavit rahati he or aise main ilaakon main tankeron se pani supplai karnaa padataa he lekin is dauraan jhagadon kii ashanka rahati he isko dekhte hue adhikariyon ko satark rahane ke nirdesh die hai taaki aise maamle hone se pehle roke ja sake
 At the same time, the BJP is taking a pinch on the police's watch over water
 bijepi kaa kahana he ki congress sarkaar ko transfar posting se hatakar vakt rahete janata ke liye pani kaise muhaiyaa karaaen ye sochna tha, lekin ab ajibo-garib sthiti main jahaan janata ko suraksha dena chahie vahaan pani ko suraksha dene kii baat kar rahe hai
 However, in the midst of the power cuts in the summer, now there is a drop-by-day frenzy in MP to quench the thirst for the water-loving public, but if the government insists on better water arrangements than the uniformed ones To get relief madhya pradesh samet desh ke kai rajya pani kii baari killat kaa saamana kar rahe hai
 The shortage of water as the temperature increases is making people very upset
 madhya pradesh main bheeshan garmi se 15 bandaron kii bhi maut ho gai he
 Significantly, the heat in Madhya Pradesh has broken the record of decades this year
 rajdhani bhopal main 40 saal kaa record todate hue paara 45
 9 degrees was reached, which is 7 degrees above normal
 garmi ke sitam kaa andaja isi se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki sarkaar ko garmi or lu se bachaav ke liye adwijuri jari kerani padi
 This is Rahul Gandhi's first visit to the state after the bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh
 varsh 2014 main vidhansabha or loksabhaa chunaavon main party ko mili shikast ke baad rahul kii is yatra ko rajya main party kaa aadhaar majboot karne ke prayaas ke taur par dekha ja rahaa he

 'PM Modi thanked the countrymen at the BJP headquarters, saying,' You have filled the faqir's hopes
 hamane naye bharat ke nirmaan ke liye janadesh maanga tha or logon ne hamen iske liye aashirwad diya he
 Addressing packed workers and supporters along with party president Amit Shah at BJP headquarters, he said, "for the first time in India, the voting percentage has been so high and now the world has to recognize the strength of Indian democracy
" ' unhone yah bhi kaha ki ‘mere jivan kaa har pal' or ‘mere sharir kaa har kan' desh kii bhalaai ke liye samarpit he
 He also urged the opposing parties to forget the bitterness of the election campaign
 unhone kaha ,‘‘hamen aage badhnaa hoga

 '' china ne myanmar main rohingya sankat se nibatane main ek mahatvapurn paksh ke rup main saamne aane or shaayad madhyasth bhi banane kii ichha kaa sanket diya he
 Foreign Minister Wang Yi, who visited Bangladesh and Myanmar from 17 November to 20 November, presented a 'three-stage' diplomatic proposal after talks in Dhaka
 naypiidav kii apni yatra ke baad wang ne is baat ko rekhaankit kiya ki china kii baari-bharkam vittiya takat is pahal kaa samarthan karegi
 He also announced a new 'china-myanmar Economic Corridor'
 beijing main vishleshak is rajanyik pahal ko kshetreey samasyaon se nibatane main ek aatmavishwaspurn chini kootneeti ke ek purv lakshan ke rup main dekh rahe hai
 China's diplomacy so far was cautiously guided by the proverb 'let your lashes hide, wait for your time'
 lekin vishleshkon ke anusaar, china ab ise peeche chhodkar us taraf ja rahaa he jisaki ghoshnaa raashtrapati shi jinping ne haal hi main kii thi
 President Xi announced a 'new era' in October in which he said that China would adopt a 'central role' of the world
 aise main myanmar is nae yug ke ek pareekshan-prayog ke rup main ubhar saktaa he
 China said on 20 November that its proposal had "received approval" from both Bangladesh and Myanmar
 isamen myanmar ke rakhin praant main shanti behaal karne ke liye teen charnon kaa tarika apnaane kii jarurat par jor diya gaya he
 According to the United Nations, more than 6 lakh Rohingya refugees have migrated to Bangladesh since August
 pehle charan main rohingya logon ko lautne or unhen seemaa paar bhaagane se rokane kaa mauka dene ke liye jamini str par sangharsh viraam kaa suzav he
 The second phase is to encourage and support Bangladesh and Myanmar to strengthen mutual relations and find solutions on the basis of 'equality'
 tisare charan main antarrashtriya samudaay ko rakhin praant ko viksit karne main sahaayta karne kii baat kahi gai he
 It is no coincidence that China continues to invest billions of dollars in ongoing projects in both Bangladesh and Myanmar
 unhone myanmar sarkaar kii salaahkaar ang saan su kii ke saath baatcheet ke baad myanmar ke saath ek aarthik galiyare kaa nirmaan karne kii yojana kii ghoshnaa kii
 This corridor is existing 1
 5 arab dollar kii ek pipeline par aadhaarit hoga, jo (china ke) unnan praant ko kyaukpiyu bandargah or ek vishesh aarthik kshetra ke saath jodatii he
 This pipeline took off the Bay of Bengal in April
 2 karod ton kii vaarshik kshamta ke saath china ko tel dene kii shuruyaat kar di he
 Gu Xiaojang, a strategic expert, told the party-run Global Times that the corridor would further guarantee 'easier access to the Indian Ocean'
 iske pehle ki prekshak yah ingit karne lagen ki china ke ranneetik iraade is kootneeti kii vaastavik prerana hai, vidwaan chen phenging kehete hai ki ''galiyara myanmar ke sangharsh ko kam karne main madadgaar hone ke saath kvayanmar ke logon ke liye behatar rojgaar or behatar jivan str pradaan karke china or myanmar kii seemaa par sthirataa sunishchit kar saktaa he
 "in the current situation, the answer is less, more questions about both the proposal and China's intention
" yah puche jane par ki kya myanmar sarkaar ne vastav main china se sangharsh viraam kaa vaada kiya he, videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa lu kong ne vivaran nahin diya
 He also did not say that the proposed second phase meant that China wanted to mediate between Bangladesh and Myanmar on issues such as the return of people who had fled their homes
 yah kahana abhi thodaa jaldi hoga ki china kii yah yojana safal hogi
 But China's new appetite for regional leadership is very clear
 yah cheez apane aap main kshetra ke liye baari jatiltaayen paidaa kar sakati he
 Especially when India, the other major party in the region, has shown no intention of doing so
 isi saal hone vaale gujarat vidhansabha chunaav se pehle congress kii rajya ikai main sab kuch thik nahin he

 MNREGA is like a document in every village
 bhrashtachar kaa dastauez or badlaav kaa bhi
 For the last one or two years, there have been different kinds of voices about change in MNREGA
 modi sarkaar ne aupchaarik str par kabhi manaregaa ko badalane yaa khatm karne kii baat nahin kii he, magar phir aaj rajasthan kii mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje kii chitthee se ashankaon ko yakeen hone laga ki kahin sarkaar ke nishane par manaregaa to nahin he
 It is not that the days of social security related schemes are being carried out on the pretext of change in MNREGA, which will later be turned into stories of success in reducing the financial deficit
 ekadam se ashankit hone kii zarurat nahin he, magar saamaajik suraksha kii in yojanaon ke bare main madhyamvarg ko jarur sochna chahie ki yah khayraat nahin, zarurat hai
 Experts whose articles could not generate 100 percent employment, they also keep writing that every day there is no benefit from spending on such schemes
 aaj ke indian express main seemaa chishti kii ek khabar chhapi ki rajasthan kii mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje ne 6 june ko kendriya gramin vikaas mantri nitin gadakari ko khat likhaa he ki kya manaregaa ko act yani kanoon kii jagah yojana main badla ja saktaa he
 Why rural employment should be guaranteed with the help of any law and whether such employment cannot be provided through any scheme
 yani aap dasharkon ko yah fark bhi samajhnaa hoga ki kanoon kii guarantee or sirf yojana main kya buniyadi fark he
 Vasundhara has written that it should be seen what is the benefit of having an act
 nateeja yah hua he ki tamaam tarah ke sanghathanon ne mukademon kii baadh laga di he
 Work done through departmental work should also be considered as employment under MNREGA
 gaanvon ke vikaas ke liye alag-alag naam se kai yojanaayen chalati hai
 However, apart from these, in 2005, employment was made a right of employment
 pradhanmantri narendra modi apane chunavi bhaashanon main in adhikaar kanoon kii aalochana kiya karte the
 But after the review meeting on 26 June on the weak monsoon, the note issued by the PMO said that the Prime Minister has issued a directive that MNREGA should be used to generate employment in rural areas, where needed
 His confidence is reflected
 divangat gramin vikaas mantri gopinath munde ne bhi apni praathamiktaaon main kaha tha ki manaregaa se bhrashtachar khatm karenge mazaduri ke bhugtan main deree bardaasht nahin hogi
 In 2012 too, the UPA government launched its second version
 iske tahat manaregaa main tees nae kaamon ko joda gaya
 For this, these works were put into ten categories
 watershed, sinchai, baadh prabandhan, kheti or pashupaalan ke kaam, matsay paalan, gramin peyajal or safai kaa kaam
 For the first time, it also included construction of toilets
 yani manaregaa main sanshodhan hota hi rahaa he
 The present government is saying a new thing that a permanent structure should be prepared in villages under MNREGA so that they remain a means of livelihood for long
 manaregaa main bhrashtachar ne isaki vishwasaneeyata kharaab kar di he
 Many stories related to this will be found in every village and MNREGA money has made the election of the chief as costly and violent
 lekin manaregaa kii kamyaabi ke bhi kisse hai, jo in daagdar kisson ke andhere main kho gaye
 Praveen Singh of the website called Niti Central has written that the Modi government is going to link MNREGA with Indira Awaas Yojana
 iske tahat prayek parivaar ko ghar banane ke liye alag se 12000 rupee milenge
 According to Niti Central, at present, under Indira Awaas Yojana, Rs
 7 xxrep 4 0 is available in the plains
 12000 kii raashi alag se di jaaegi
 MNREGA will be linked to the development of villages and its wages will be given from the account of MNREGA
 vasundhara raaje ne bhi apni chitthee main is baat par vichaar karne ke liye likhaa he ki manaregaa ke tahat skill apgredation ke kharchen ko shaamil kiya janaa chahie or ise rashtriya gramin aajeevika mishan se jod dena chahie
 On 26 June, Subodh Ghadiyal wrote in the Times of India that sixty percent of the work done in a district under the central government MNREGA would be linked to agriculture
 ise sabhi rajyon ke liye anivaary banaaya jayega
 Opinions have been sought from the states in this matter
 manaregaa ke swaroop main badlaav kii tamaam khabaron ko dekhakar ek sawaal yah bhi paidaa hota he ki kahin sarkaar tamaam yojanaon se ise jodakar is yojana ko hi pichley darvaaze se khatm to nahin karnaa chaahati
 Modi government wants to build sustainable resources in villages with the money and work of MNREGA
 jairam ramesh ne bhi gramin vikaas mantri rahete manaregaa 2 ke laanch ke vakt kaha tha ki manaregaa ko utpaadakta badhaane ke upkaran main jald se jald badal dena chahie
 But Vasundhara's letter is raising questions on its original form, what is the need to maintain its legal rights
 yojana kyon na bana den? Today CPM leader Vrinda Karat has written a letter to Nitin Gadkari stating that MNREGA should not be made a victim of financial compulsions
 is kanoon ko or majboot karne kii zarurat he
 Vasundhara Raje's letter creates anxiety
 agar aisa hua to rojgaar dene ke baade se krur mazaaq hoga
 i hope you will clear your government policy
 manaregaa ke kaam ko kheti ke kaary se jodne kii baat ho rahi he par iskaa pansth se sattar fisadi kaam to kheti se hi judaa hua he
 In the first six months of the 2013–14 fiscal year, 78 per cent of the work was related to water conservation land development and rural connectivity routes
 main aagrah karti hum ki yojanaon ko aapas main milaane ke naam par kaary diwas kam nahin hone chahie
 At the same time, Vasundhara Raje has written in her letter that departmental works should be considered as MNREGA work
 sipiem netaa kahati hai ki in kaamon ko manaregaa ke kaam ke alaava diya janaa chahie taaki unhen sau din se zyada kaam mili
 So should the Employment Guarantee Act be converted into an employment scheme
 or aisa hua to kya ho jayega

 modi sarkaar main rakshaamantri manohar parrikar ab kah rahe hai ki vah raksha mantralay ko dallalon se mukt karvaa kar hi dam lenge or ab bagaiyr dallalon ke hi hathiyaaron kii kharid hogi
 These things sound very good
 kuch aisi hi baaten purv rakshaamantri e
 K
 antni ne bhi kahi thi, lekin hua yah ki na to mantralay dallalon se azaad ho paaya or naa hi sena ko nae hathiyaar mili
 Antony and Parrikar also have some similarities

 By the way, according to experts, the purchase of weapons is not possible in the world today without brokers or middlemen
 vajah yah he ki sarkaar or hathiyaar companiyon ke bich koi to aisa shaks hoga jo sarkaar ko hathiyaaron kii baarikiyon ke bare main batayega or hathiyaar companiyon ko sarkaar ke bare main
 In most places, such middlemen have been given legal status, so that everyone knows the amount of arms in this deal and the amount of money that went to the middlemen
 iske bagaiyr to haalat yah he ki desh main kis hathiyaar kii sahi keemat kya he or kitni rakam bichauliye ko di gai, is bare main bas kayaas hi lagaae ja sakate hai
 There are many times that by taking advantage of this, arms companies sell the equivalent of a hundred rupees for a thousand, and give a hidden amount as commission to the dealer
 kabhi khulaasa hua to thik he, varanaa dhandha to aise hi chalata rahata he
 Although the government is claiming that it will expedite the process of purchasing arms for the army, but how? Its blue print has not been revealed yet
 in dinon jin bhi hathiyaaron kii kharid ko antim rup diya gaya, vah single windon ke tahat ek desh kii company se kharida ja rahaa he
 But when the arms are procured from the 'open window', then the reality will be revealed
 yah baat bhi kisi se chuphi nahin he ki hamaari sena aajkal hathiyaaron kii bhayankar killat se jujh rahi he
 Challenges are constantly increasing on the outskirts, but how will we face these challenges through talks or weapons? It is not decided yet
 25 saal se zyada ho gaye koi top nahin kharidi gai he
 The same remains with the Navy in the running condition called submarine
 teenon senaaon ke paas helicopter kii bhi jabardast kami he
 It has been six months to the government, but no defense deal has been signed yet
 ab, jabaki, sarkaar kah rahi he ki vah bagaiyr midilamen ke hathiyaar kharidenge to aapako iske liye koi na koi thos system to bananaa padegaa
 Even if you do not call him middleman or broker, you will have to make some such arrangement, only then defense deals will be possible with transparency
 yahaan yah bhi jaananaa jaruri he ki dephence ko chhodkar duusare sector main sarkaar ko midilamen ke hone se koi dikkat nahin
 With the help of middlemen, there are thousands of crores of deals in other sectors like energy
 rakshaamantri ye bhi kah rahe hai ki hathiyaaron kii khaid main teji or paardarshita hogi, lekin kaise? yah bataane ke liye rakshaamantri filhal taiyaar nahi

 The deceased's brother Ashish told that on March 14, an unknown young man and a young girl had come to Sunil's field
 jiske baad sunil ne 100 nambar par phone kar police ko bula liya
 The police took the young woman and took her away with him
 lekin agle hi din teen police vaale kisi nijee gaadi main sunil ke ghar pahunche
 The policemen took Sunil with him to the Kabdi Road Model Town police station
 ashish kaa kahana he ki vahaan police waalon ne sunil koderaya dhamkayaor marapit bhi kii
 Policemen started threatening Sunil, saying that he raped the girl
 pulicekarmiyon ne sunil se kaha ki ladki ne uske khilaaf bayaan diya he
 However, he refused to show up when asked for a copy of the written statement
 ashish ne kaha ki subhash naam ke esai ne maamla nipataane ke liye sunil se ek lakh rupee kii maang kii
 Refusing to have this much money, Subhash asked for 30 thousand rupees
 is par ashish ne kaha ki uske paas sirf 10 hajaar rupee hai
 Ashish told that at the behest of Subhash he gave 10,000 rupees to the policeman of another village
 ashish ne bataaya ki usne jis police vaale ko paise die vah subhash ke saath unke ghar aa chukaa he
 The policemen then released his brother Sunil
 ashish apane bhai sunil ko lekar ghar aa gaya
 But, unhappy with the police's harassment and the rape charges, Sunil committed suicide by consuming poison

 Anurag Jain, a joint secretary in the PMO, says, "the rejuvenation of the grievance redressal system has its roots in the new management style of the PMO, in which processes have been redesigned

 After complaints, this period was extended to 90 days

 Apart from this public grievance system, another major change has come in the manner of the Prime Minister's National Relief Fund

 The Prime Minister's personal letter is also sent to him at the time of approval of the amount and prior information is also received through SMS

 barish hogi
 "like this Bollywood song, some seasons have gone, but now the meeting is not far away
 barish to shaayad nahin hogi, lekin is thand main ab bijepi or aam aadmi party kaa milan hone vaala he
 Do not think that these two parties will fight elections together but in the electoral arena, these parties will meet and fight each other
 donon partiyon ne chunaav kii taiyaari shuru kar di he
 By the way, the Aam Aadmi Party is already busy preparing loudly, but now BJP has also come forward
 kiran bedi, shajia ilmi, krishna tirath jaise mahila chehron ko shaamil karke bijepi ne apni ranneeti saaf kar di he
 Keep the Congress away in this meeting, because the real meeting of the Congress will be when it is necessary that after the elections, it will decide with whom to form a government or with whom
 dilli ke chunaav ko lekar jo atakalein lagaai ja rahi thim, vah ab khatm ho gai hai
 Voting will take place in Delhi on 7 February and counting of votes on 10 February
 iske baad hi pataa chalegaa ki modi ji kejariwal ji ko badhai denge yaa kejariwal modi ji ko
 The government will be formed by March, we will assess in April, the program will start to criticize the government in June
 
 
 
 Then it will continue as it is
 vaise aap logon kaa kahana he ki is baar 'aap' aapaki he yaa bijepi abaki
 You are missing the 49-day government of Kejriwal or Modi ji for seven months
 yah ladaai bijepi yaa aap party ke bich nahin, balki modi or kejariwal ke bich he
 a battle that appears very rare, as seen in Varanasi, where the entire media was seen playing a flute on the banks of the Ganges in Varanasi
 vaise yah to saaf he ki dilli ke is maidan main kejariwal to chunaav lard rahe he lekin modi ji nahin
 But the BJP is contesting elections led by Modi ji, like in Maharashtra, Jammu and Kashmir and in Jharkhand
 chunavi maidan main kiran bedi ke rup main modi ji ne brahmastra chhod diya he
 a clean face has been found for the BJP in Delhi
 harshavardhan ke kendriya mantri ban jane ke baad bijepi ke andar, jo sankat dikhaai de rahaa tha, vah kiran bedi ke aane se dur ho gaya he
 Whether or not Bedi can become a ray of hope for the BJP will be known only after the election, but the biggest challenge for Kiran Bedi will be the "black clouds" inside the party waiting for their opportunity, To shore up and take the party in a new direction
 jab loksabhaa chunaav ke baad kiran bedi ke party main aane kii baat chal rahi thi, tab kiran bedi ko lekar party ke andar aawaaj uthi thi
 Local leaders were not happy with this news
 abhi bhi kai netaa naaraaz hai, lekin khulkar saamne nahin aa rahe hai
 It does not seem that BJP is going to benefit much from Kiran Bedi's arrival
 chunaav bhi zyada dur nahin he or kiran bedi ke paas zyada samay bhi nahin he ki vah logon ke paas pahunche or unka dil jeet saken, lekin aam aadmi party bijepi ke chehre ko lekar jo sawaal uthaa rahi thi shaayad ab use rokane main kiran bedi sakasham hongi
 The question that Arvind Kejriwal was raising during every rally or interview of the bjp's Chief Minister will now remain a "question"
 kahin na kahin kiran bedi is lihaaz se aam aadmi party ko roak sakati hai
 Kiran Bedi, once a friend of Arvind Kejriwal, is now seen standing against Kejriwal
 anna andolan ke samay kejariwal or kiran bedi ek saath janalokapal ke liye anna hazaare ke saath ladaai lard rahe the, lekin jab kejariwal ne apni party bana lee tab kiran bedi or kejariwal alag hue, lekin kiran bedi kahati hai ki modiji kii raajnneetik style ne unhen prabhavit kiya he
 Kiran Bedi, who once criticized Modi ji, has become the Kiran of BJP
 raajnneeti main kejariwal kaa jo tajurba he, vah kiran ke paas nahin, lekin kiran bedi bhi ek acchhee prashaasak rup main jaani jaati hai
 If people like Kejriwal and Kiran come in the elections, then the country will progress
 is baar chunaav kaaphi dilachasp hone vaala he
 Such an election has rarely been seen in the history of India, where the issue of development, not caste and religion, is being contested
 bijli, pani, sadaken jaise mudde chunaav main rajanetaaon ke liye chunauti ban rahe hai
 It seems that the BJP is slightly ahead of the Aam Aadmi Party in Delhi
 madhyam varg ko modi par bharosa he, vah aap party ke upar baari pad saktaa he
 The BJP can benefit from the BJP at the Center in these elections, but the votes of the lower middle class and minorities are with Kejriwal
 49 din kii sarkaar chhodane kii jo galati aam aadmi party ne kii thi, use iskaa ahsaas ho chukaa he or sabase badi baat yah he ki kejariwal apni galati ke liye dilli kii janata se maafi maang chuke hai
 It remains to be seen whether the people of Delhi will listen to Kejriwal's heart or Modi's mind
