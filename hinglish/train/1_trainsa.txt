 aadarneey sakshi maharaj, Greetings
 aapako pranaam or aadarneey isliye likh rahi hum, kyonki ek to aap umr main mujhase baden hai, doosraa aapke naam ke aage or peeche 'sant' or 'maharaj' jaise upmaanon kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 In such a situation, i cannot afford to address you by saying 'dear' and 'hi'
 aapke bare main juyada jaanati nahin, na hi kabhi jaanane kii ichha rahi, lekin jab se centre main nai sarkaar ai he, aap jab-tab surkhiyon main aa hi jate hai
 First on the statement of Godse, then on the statement of four women born to Hindu women tomorrow
 main aapke is bayaan se pasopesh main hum, kyonki samaj nahin aa rahaa he ki riyect kaise karun
 
 
 Because i am a Hindu by birth, and a woman too, but still not in the mood to imbibe the call of your four children
 ab aisa nahin he ki bilkul hi iske khilaaf hum, lekin mere man main kuch sawaal hai
 
 
 If you give me their answer, then i know what changes my mind
 aapane kaha ki har hindu stri ko chaar bachche paidaa karne chahie or unamem se ek sadhu-sanyasiyon ko de dena chahie or duusare ko seemaa par ladane ke liye bhej dena chahie
 The first thing is that i do not want to separate my child from myself, at least until she is able to take care of herself and never wants to be a part of the saffron movement
 duusari baat yah ki agar main use aapke kahe ke anusaar sena yaa fouj main bhejne kaa nirnay leti bhi hum to vahaan jane se pehle 20-22 saal tak mujhe hi uskaa paalan-poshan karnaa padegaa
 i am teaching my seven-year-old son in a convent school in Delhi, so i want the rest of the children to get the same level of education
 kya unke fouj main jane se pehle, unki shiksha-diksha or parvarish kaa jimmaa aap uthaaenge
 
 
 The Are you willing to accept both of these situations, or the conditions that i said
 
 
 ? Don't know if you watch TV or not, but i saw on TV yesterday that the government is running an ad in support of legal abortion, which clearly states that in any case, abortion should be done under the supervision of government doctors
 Should be done haalanki isamen kai niyam bhi honge, jinke bare main mujhe abhi tafasil se pataa karnaa hoga
 Now either you do not agree with your government's opinion or the government with your opinion
 
 
 aap donon ke bich samvadaheenata kii ek badi diwaar nazar aati he
 
 
 That's why your thoughts are so different
 aapaki party adhyaksh ne bhi aapke bayaan se pallaa jhaadte hue kaha ki yah aapaki vyaktigat tippanee he or is par aage faisla party kii disiplinary cameti karegi
 You also said somewhere that 'these traitors have not been satisfied
 
 
 ' main bhram main hum ki aap kin logon kii baat kar rahe hai
 
 
 The Please be open
 
 
 sakshi maharaj, kya aapako nahin lagata ki aap apni vyaktigat mahatvakankshaon kii purti ke liye garib, dharmik, kam padhi-likhi mahilaon kaa istemaal kar rahe hai
 Don't you want to spread hate politics at the cost of women? agar aisa nahin he to meraa aapse sidhaa sawaal yah he ki aakhir aapane yah aahvaan ek dharmik sabha main hi kyon kiya
 
 
 The Can you do this at any of the FICCI women's conferences or any function of the Army or the Airforce
 
 
 ? shaayad nahin, kyonki tab vahaan koi bhi aapako syriasli nahin legaa
 
 
 You deliberately made your target audience those women, whose life extends only in religion
 jinke liye dharm or dharmaguru hi jivan kaa saar hote hai
 
 
 These are women who have not yet learned to stand on their feet, who have to resort to religion to get out of the walls of the house
 maharaj, ye ve mahilaayein hai, jo aarthik rup se dusron par nirbhar hai, phir chaahe vah pati ho yaa betaa
 
 
 He is the second person
 aapane kah to diya, par kya kabhi aapane sochaa he ki agar ek mahila chaar-chaar bachche paidaa karegi to uski apni sehat kis kadar khatm ho jaaegi, agar chaar-chaar saal ke gap par bhi uske bachche honge to uske jivan ke mahatvapurn 16 saal bacchon ko paalane main hi nikal jaaenge, or is dauraan uske sharir ke saath-saath uskaa man bhi hameshaa ke liye osteoporosis kaa shikaar ho jayega
 Now tell me, how should i not consider your statement to be anti-women and use of women for personal ambitions
 
 
 ? Maharaj, i am a Hindu woman, living life according to Hinduism, i want to give my son a brother or sister as well, but at the same time i love myself a lot
 main nahin chaahati ki jab main adhedavastha main kadam rakhun to meri haddiyaan itani kamazor ho jaaen ki main pahaado par na chadh sakuun, main khub jeena chaahati hum, apane parivaar or bachche ke saath
 
 
 Walking with them, taking a sea walk, laughing, sharing their sorrows, caring for their aging parents, watching movies
 
 
 ye sab karnaa chaahati hum
 i do not want my child to grow up always complaining that my mother has never had time for me, because the child needs her mother the most
 antim or sabase badi baat main aarthik rup se dusron par nirbhar nahin hona chaahati, main ye sari khushiyaan apane dam par, apni mehnat se arjeet karnaa chaahati hum
 
 
 Not a bonus form under the guise of a relationship
 aise main mere paas aapaki baat na maanane ke alaava koi or chaara nahin he
 
 
 If you answer these questions, then maybe i can be guided

 ham chaahate hai ki pakistan kam se kam in logon ko kanoon ke daayre main laae or kargar dhang se aisa kare
 Rejecting Pakistan Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani's claim that Pakistan does not have sufficient evidence to take action against leaders of lashkar-e-taiba like Saeed, the Prime Minister said, "let me first of all play the role of lashkar-e-taiba There is no need for any more proof in relation

 30 saal kii electronic ejeeniyar maanasi joshi ne ek sadak haadase main apana ek pair kho diya, lekin maanasi kaa jajba kam nahin hua hai
 Mansi, who returned to her house in Ahmedabad, was welcomed by the Gujarat Sports Authority
 maanasi ke saath parul parmaar jo kii world championships main uske saath final main thi wo bhi ahmedabad se hi hai
 World Champion Mansi Joshi and Arjuna Award winner Parul Parmar both have dreams of brightening the country's name in the 2020 Para Olympics
 para olympic world championships kii khaas baat yah thi ki, final main donon hi bhartiya khilaadi ek duusare ke saamne thim
 Mansi Joshi and Parul Parmar, in which Mansi defeated the four-time Para Badminton Champion Parul to claim the gold medal himself
 maanasi kaa kahana he ki unke liye shuruyaat main yah kaaphi chunauteepurn tha
 She had been training at Gopichand Academy for the past one year, it was very difficult to do three sessions a day and then go to the physio, when i went for the tournament, i did not expect to do gold in my name, but yes i was sure that i had prepared differently, it was expected that something good will happen
 maanasi ne is jeet ko hasil karne ke liye kaaphi physical taiyaari ke saath-saath maansik taur par bhi taiyaariyaan kii thi
 Mansi says that in order to remain mentally calm, he had read many books and also learned to keep the mind calm

 It was a very interesting match
 vahiin is match main silver medal jeetne vaali parul parmaar ne abtak apni jindagi main badminton main 35 alag-alag championships jiti hai
 Parul Parmar says that this is the first time that after winning so many championships, we have got instant money
 aam taur par para player ko sponcer bhi milanaa kaaphi mushkil rahata he
 Mansi says that the way the common players get help, the same help should be for the para players as well

 At the same time, on Wednesday, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi bowed at the historic Somnath temple
 chunavi gahamagahami or raajnneetik jumalebaji se alag hat kar ‘aaj tak’ nesomnath mandirke aas-paas ke ilaake kaa jayja liya
 The picture that came out was shocking
 somnath mandirse mahaj kuch kadamon kii duuri par hi swatchta or vikaas ke jumale hawa hote najar aae
 On one side of the Somnath temple is the Arabian Sea and on the other side the confluence of the deer Saraswati Kapila
 puranic katha ke mutabik is sundar sthaan par chandra bhagwaan kii kathor tapasya se shankar ji prasann hue the or unhen rogon se mukt kar diya tha
 Despite all the mythological and tourism importance, the history of Valmiki settlement adjacent to the Somnath temple has neither changed nor the present
 valmiki basti se bhavy somnath mandir to najar aata he
 But as far as the condition of the township itself is, this dirt has not been freed from the curse of backwardness
 gandagi main rahane ko majabuuravalmiki basti main adhiktar safai karmchaaree pariwaron ke saath rahete hai
 These Parasomnath temple is responsible for cleanliness and maintenance
 somnath mandirto inaki mehnat se chakachak rahata he
 But after taking stock of the Valmiki colony, it came to know that these cleaning workers are forced to live in their own mess
 basti main pahunchate hi mahilaon ne gher liya
 The toilet which is in the settlement does not look less than any ruins
 naa yahaan darwaja he, naa bijli or naa hi pani
 Settlers complain that for many years no one has improved to repair this toilet
 basti main rahane waalon kaa kahana he ki yahaan har chunaav main netaa vot maangane aate hai
 After the election is over, no one bothered to peep here
 basti waalon ke mutabik agar is baar chunaav se pehle hi shauchalay kii marammat samet jaruri kaary nahin hue to ve vot nahin daalenge
 The person seeking votes changes, but the condition of the place is not Malikwara area near Valmiki
 ye muslim bahul ilaaka he
 People living in Malikwara allege that the leaders who claim their leadership go away in every election by telling which party to vote for
 vot to malikvaara ke log daalate hai
 The winning leaders also change here
 lekin malikvaara main rahane vaale logon ke naa to gharon ke angan badale or naa hi yahaan kii galiyaan
 The people of Malikwara also have to go to the broken toilet of Valmiki colony
 majaburi main kai yahaan logon ko khule main bhi shouch janaa padataa he
 There is no place for water supply in Malikwara
 hafte main ek baar pani aata he
 The discrimination is being questioned by the people of Malikwara, what else is this discrimination, if all the surrounding areas become better, roads have been built there but Malikwara's condition remains the same
 malikvaara ke kuch log ye shikaayat karte bhi mili ki aasapaas ke kshetra main koi viviipi aata he to unke ilaake kii bijli tak kaat di jaati he
 It is here that the meaning of a healthy India, the world famous Somnath temple attracts devotees from all over the country, while the poor condition of the settlements with this frame raises questions only on the Gujarat model of development, which in other states has a lot of emphasis
 The noise has been repeated
 vikaas or saaf safai se in bastiyon kii bhi tasviir badale, tabhi ‘svachh bharat, swasth bharat’ kaa naaraa sahi myne main saakaar hoga

 navaratri main maa durga kipujake badaratiavashya karnaa chahie
 Worship without aarti is considered incomplete
 maa durga kii puja main aarti kaa vishesh mahatv he
 The Uttar Skanda Purana states that if a person does not know the mantra, does not know the method of worship, but does the aarti then the gods and goddesses accept his worship completely
 aarti kaa dharmik mahatv hone ke saath hi vaigyanikmahatwabhi he
 When ghee and camphori wick are lit with cotton, a wonderful aroma spreads to the atmosphere
 isse aas-paas ke vaataavaran main maujuud nakaartmak urja khatm ho jaati he or sakaaratmak urja kaa sanchaar hone lagata he
 Navratri 2018: Navratri is about to come, do not forget these essential things of worship
 It is believed that when the Aarti is performed by meditating on the mother Bhagwati with the sound of a conch and bell ringing in the aarti, the ongoing duality in the mind ends And the soul asleep in our body is awakened, causing the mind to become energetically energized and feel that the grace of the mother is being received
 maa durga kii aarti karte samay kin baton kaa khyaal rakhen- rui kii battiyaan banakarghimen unhen daal den
 Remove from ghee and burn it in an odd number (like 3, 5 or 7) by placing cotton lamps in a lamp
 - ek thali yaa plate main deepak ko rakh len, saath main pushp or kapur bhi rakh len
 At home, you can also do aarti by making a light
 - puja sthanon main paanch battiyon se aarti kii jaati he, jise panch pradeep bhi kehete hai
 Perform the Aarti of the mother while playing conch, hour etc
 - aarti kii thali maa durga kii murti ke samaksh upar se neeche golakaar ghumaayen
 That is, the aarti should be rotated in clockwise direction
 Navratri 2018: kalash sthapana main bhuulakar bhi naa karen ye galtiyanarati karne ke kai laabh-yadi maa ke pujan main jo truti rah jaati he, toaratise uski purti ho jaati he
 After the aarti, keep both the palms above the flame for a few moments and touch your forehead, nose, ears, eyes and face
 Keeping the palm for a few moments above the flame brings some sharp element in our hands
 aarti karne kaa hi nahin, aarti dekhne kaa bhi bahut bada punya he
 Jomandurga sees the aarti and takes the aarti with both hands, her wishes fulfilled by her mother
 maa durga ko prasann karne ke liye aarti kii thaal main kya kya rakhen-thali main deepak ke alaava kapur, puja ke phool, dhoop-agarbatti, chaaval avashya rakhana chahie

 On the second day of PM Modi's statement, Congress President Rahul Gandhi while speaking in the Lok Sabha on the Rafale issue said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has lied in the interview
 puraa desh rafel ke mudde par piem modi par ungali uthaa rahaa he
 Referring to the Rafale deal, Rahul Gandhi said that Prime Minister Modi did not even talk about the Rafael deal in his one and a half hour interview
 congress adhyaksh ne pradhanmantri par aarope lagaate hue sawaal kiya ki aakhir kyon ye deal echeel se chin kar anil ambani ko de di gai? itnaa hi nahin unhone sawaal kiya ki jab bharat ko tatkaal in vimaanon kii jarurat he to bhi abhi tak ek bhi vimaan bharat kii jameen par kyon nahin utraa he?bataa den ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ne saal ke pehle din mangalvaar ko samachar agency ANI ko die gaye intervyuu main rafel mudde par apni baat rakhi thi
 PM Modi said that i have always spoken openly on Rafael and there is no personal charge against me in this
 rafel par maine hameshaa khulkar bolaa he or main is baat kaa jawaab pehle bhi sansad main de chukaa hum
 a decision has been taken from the Supreme Court on Rafael
 piem modi ne kaha ki rafel deal ke maamle ko supreme court bhi saaf kar chukaa he
 Milk and water of milk have been done
 unhone kaha, 'media ko rafel deal par rahul gandhi se saboot maangana chahie
 Prove what the Congress is alleging
 'modi ne kaha tha ki rahul ko baar-baar bolne kii beemaari he, to mujhe baar-baar bolne kii jarurat he kya? unhone kaha ki aazaadee ke baad se hameshaa dephence deal vivaadit kyon rahaa he?' The popular multiplayer mobile game PUBG Mobile has been discontinued in China
 isaki vajah revenue he
 The company was not licensed to generate revenue from the government
 royatres kii ek report ke mutabik Tencent ne pabaji mobile ke yugers ko Heping Jingying yaa Elite Force for peace naam ke game par migrat kar rahi he
 Tencent is a big company and comes with many apps
 inamen hi ek Helping Jingying naam kaa bi ap he or is ap se paise kamaane ke liye company ko license mil chukaa he
 In China too, an angle of nationalism has also been given about the pubic ban
 report ke mutabik is game ko vahaan kii libration army air force ke sammaan main ye ap he or iskaa theme anti terarysm he
 Since there was nothing like this in PUBG Mobile, experts believe that it did not get a license for monetization
 gauratlab he ki player ananon bettleground yani PUBG pichley maheene march main launch hua tha or yah kaaphi popular hua
 According to reports, there are 70 million players of this game in China and because of this, company 1 through In app purchase
 8 billian se lekar 1
 Could earn up to 48 billion
 bharat main bhi kuch jagahon par pabaji ko bain kiya gaya he or ise bain karne kii maang bhi hoti rahi he
 However, the reason for the pub ban is quite different here
 report ke mutabik iraq ke bhi zyaadaatar ilaakon main ise bain kiya gaya he
 Tick talk was also banned in India recently, although the ban was later removed from this app

 When asked by the media about the letter written by Kejriwal, according to LG Najeeb Jung's office, the Lt

 But there are other factors as well
 iske gharelu kaarak bhi hai or ham in sabhi samasyaon se nipatane kii koshish kar rahe hai

 Manmohan said, i will urge the House that nothing is going to be achieved by toppling the sentiments of its people
 yadhyapi ham mushkil main hai, lekin hamen bharosa he jaisaa ki vitt mantri ne apane bajet bhaashan main kaha tha
 We are confident that in two-three years we will be able to bring the economy back on the path of strong growth
 manmohan ne kaha, iske kai antarrashtriya kaarak hai
 There have been two crises in the international system
 ek 2008-09 kaa banking sankat he, uske baad 2011 main eurozon sankat aayaa
 Manmohan said, these things affect our economy
 lekin iske anya kaarak bhi hai

 Before the assembly elections in Rajasthan, Aaj Tak worked to find the pulse of the state
 ajtak ke khaas kaarykram 'panchayat ajtak' main guuruuvaar ko rajasthan chunaav se jude tamaam muddon par charchaa hui
 In the fourth season of the program 'kiska Hoga Rajasthan', Karni Sena leader Lokendra Singh Kalvi made many claims
 is dauraan unhone kaha ki chunaav ke baad vasundhara adwani mod main aa jaaengi
 During this session, Diya Kumari of BJP and Ragini Nayak from Congress also participated
 'vasundhara adwani mod main aa jaaengi'karani sena ke netaa lokentre singh kaalvi ne daawa kiya ki vasundhara raaje purv up raashtrapati bhairon singh shekhavat kii 'criation' hai
 But he also claimed that once Bhairon Singh Shekhawat told him that i made a big mistake by making Vasundhara the CM
 unhone daawa kiya- chunaav ke baad vasundhara raaje adwani mod main aaengi
 Kalvi did not stop here
 unhone diya kumari kii taraf ishaara karte hue kaha ki savai madhopur kii vidhayika modi mod main aa jaaengi
 Kalvi said- BJP lost in Ajmer by-election
 naam badnaam hua rajput samaaj kaa
 Appealing to the Rajput community, he said - i say that all 36 groups should vote
 main bijepi ko savai madhopur main harva duungaa
 Questioning the claim of being a Rajput, without naming Vasundhara, he said that many people are claiming to be Rajput
 gauratlab he ki vasundhara kai baar yah bayaan de chuki hai ki vah rajput kii beti hai or jat parivaar kii bahu
 Kalvi also criticized this
 unhone kaha ki rajput samaaj ke kai log vijaateey vivaah kaa virodh karte rahe hai
 "what does the BJP want from the Rajput society?" When asked if you would blackmail the BJP, the leader of this army, Lokendra Singh Kalvi, said - the voice of Karni Sena is loud
 lekin bijepivale rajput samaaj se kya chaahate hai? rajputon ne gulaami kii had tak bijepi kaa saath diya, lekin aaj rajput samaaj kii kya ahmiyat he? dilli main baithe logon main raajnneetik ichhashakti nahin thi
 This was the reason that apart from Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat, the film Padmavat was released nationwide
 kya padmavat ke maamle par ham or aap (diya kumari) amit shah se nahin mili the? rajputon ko samajhane ke liye kai conklev ho rahe hai
 The Congress has formed a committee to convince the Rajputs
 main biimaar tha, tab donon rashtriya adhyakshon (congress or bijepi) ne meraa haalchaal poocha
 Then i understood that Rajputs are asking about the condition of society, not mine

 paanch saal main pehali baar press conference main aae pradhanmantri ne agar patrakaron ke sawaalon ke jawaab nahin die to ve itane maayoos kyon hai? pradhanmantri kaa yah rukh darasal bataata he ki ve is patrakarita kii parvaah nahin karte
 If he had realized that there would be disadvantages of not talking to journalists, he would have spoken very well, answering all the questions
 lekin yah nuqasaan kyonkar hoga? jis pradhanmantri ne patrakaron ko ek second kaa samay nahin diya, use media ne bilkul sir ankhon par bithaae rakhaa
 The Prime Minister does not take the media on his tours, just a team used to be with him, but what if the report of any of his speeches was missed
 pichley paanch saal main ve jahaan-jahaan gaye, jo-jo bole, jin-jin ke gale lage yaa pade, un sabaki report media ne badi nishtha se kii
 The Prime Minister said that 100 million dollar investment is coming from any country, then without admitting that they must be telling the truth, if the Prime Minister told that the terrorists have broken the spirits while they were there, then no one asked that then Why are terrorist attacks happening? agar beete paanch saal main alag-alag netaaon ko mili media kawarej kaa hisaab lagaaya jaae to pradhanmantri dusron se koson aage nazar aaenge
 Even if he is compared to the previous Prime Ministers, the Prime Minister will be seen leaving everyone behind
 yah alag baat he ki iske baavjood pradhanmantri narendra modi, amit shah or bijepi ko phir bhi media se shikaayat rahi or mauqaa milte ve apane se asahmat patrakaron ko patrakarita sikhaane kii koshish karte nazar aae
 When a prime minister will get so much coverage without holding a press conference, how will he hold a press conference? When journalism will remain devoted to him, why will he give him an opportunity to ask eye to eye and ask questions
 aisa nahin ki pradhanmantri ne is dauraan intervyuu die hi nahin
 He gave many interviews
 kuch intervues ke bare main kaha gaya ki unamem sawaal or jawaab pehle se tay the
 The author of these lines has no way of confirming this
 kuch intervyuu unhone prasoon joshi or akshay kumaar jaise logon ko dena zaruri samajha
 Prasoon Joshi's interview was the longest but was a wonderful example of flattery
 us intervyuu ko dekhakar siikhaa ja saktaa he ki intervyuu kaise nahin lenaa chahie
 But even journalistic interviews were not good questions
 chunaav ke daur main bhi pradhanmantri ne alag-alag channelon ke patrakaron se baat kii
 In none of the interviews did it appear that the questions which had inconvenienced them were asked
 iske alaava paanch saal ke dauraan unke tarah-tarah ke bhaashanon kaa avikal prasaaran karne vaale tivi channelon ne kuch avasaron par bahut spasht taur par pakad main aane vaali galatiyon ko chhod kar koi gambhir sawaal uthaaya- yah yaad nahin aata
 So when the Prime Minister is getting such free publicity without a press conference, then why would he consider it necessary to answer journalists
 yah nateeja nikaalnaa aasaan he ki media kaa ek bada hissaa modi bhakthi main rama rahaa, isliye usne apni aalochanatmak bhoomika kho di
 But the truth is that even in newspapers and channels that consider themselves anti-government, there is no such serious discussion apart from the well-known criticism that people can get correct and accurate information
 darasal yah puraa daur patrakarita ke ek bade sankat kii soochna kaa daur he
 Perhaps the new pressure in journalism to report as soon as possible has almost damaged the quality of journalism
 yah hadabadaae hue patrakaron kaa daur he jinke paas soochnaaon kii pushti karne kii bhi fursat nahin he
 What happens is that any information comes from any source, journalists remain as its bus carriers, they are not able to revise it, they cannot reply to it
 masalan, bijepi or pradhanmantri kaa jor sabase zyada is baat par rahaa ki unke kaarykaal main aatankwaad ko munhtod jawaab mila
 If one had a neutral analysis of the data between 2010 and 2014 till now, then it would have become very clear that the claim being made by them in this case is wrong
 isi tarah sargical strike ke baad pakistan ke post pad jane kaa daawa bhi puri tarah sandigdh he
 On the contrary, Pakistan continued to violate the ceasefire more vigorously after the surgical strike
 yahi baat notebandi ke asar yaa duusare aarthik daavon ko lekar kahi ja sakati he
 It is not that no one would have noticed these figures
 lekin dhire-dhire yah samskruti khatm hoti ja rahi he ki aap kisi taqatvar aadmi se sawaal puuchhen
 Or if a strong man answers a question incorrectly, he may be asked a new question again
 amit shah ke paas yah suvidha he ki ve pragna thakur ko lekar sawaal puche jane par puri jaanch ko hi kaarij kar den
 Nobody is going to tell them that they are speaking wrong
 patrakarita main bas sawaal poochne kaa dikhaava bachaa he
 In the ongoing debates on TV, the questions are well known, the answers and the results of those debates
 aisi haalat main pradhanmantri press conference main aa bhi jaaen to patrakaron par krupa karte hai
 Nobody feels bad even when they do not answer the questions of journalists
 baat ai-gai ho jaati he
 While being the editor of 'times of India', Dilip Padgaonkar once said that the most powerful man in the country is the Prime Minister of this country and the second most powerful man is the editor of 'times of India'
 tab bhi is vaktavy kii bahut aalochana hui thi
 a good journalist should not fall for power
 yah moh sabase pehle uski patrakarita kaa ksharan karata he
 But when journalism is doing its work, the moral aura it is filled with, all bow its head even before its strength
 lekin yah shaayad kisi or daur kii baat he
 Now the situation is that the ruling comes, gives a speech, asks the kindness of some journalists like Kripa and goes out regardless of answering a question and then one day after that in his saints posture in all newspapers and channels There are pictures
 aise main vah kiske prati javabdeh ho or kyon javabdeh ho
 Actually, journalism also needs to ask some questions to itself

 ' jaavdekar ne kaha, 'varsh 2014 se hi rashtriya rajdhani kshetra main sarkaar kii ore se uthaae gaye kadamon kii vajah se dilli main hawa kii gunvattta sudhari he
 After talks with Chinese counterpart Li Ganjie at the meeting, Javadekar said that China is fighting to combat pollution, especially in Beijing
 unhone kaha, ‘china bharat se sikh rahaa he
 Lee asked how to deal with air pollution this year
 yah lagaataar chalane vaali ladaai he or iske liye lagaataar nae navonmesh upayon kii jarurat he
 Javadekar said that Delhi and Beijing are cooperating in fighting pollution and will explore possibilities of increasing it, as both cities have already been declared 'sister cities'

 Earlier, Judge Joshi reserved the decision after studying the case

 Public Prosecutor Bhavani Singh Bhati reached the Sessions Court
 - salmaan ke vakil, bahan alvira, bodyguard shera or manager pahunche seshan court- khatri ne hi sunai thi salmaan ko paanch saal kii sajaa
 - Consultation with CJM Dev Kumar Khatri
 - seshan jaj rabindra kumaar joshi pahunche court
 Earlier, Salman's lawyer Mahesh Bora had said that if Salman does not get bail from the sessions court today, then he will petition the link court
 unki puri koshish hogi ki link court main bhi jamaanat yachika par aaj hi sunwaayee ho, kyonki aisa nahin hota he to salmaan ko kam se kam do din or jodhpur central jail main hi gujaarna hoga
 On the other hand, government lawyer Bhawani Singh Bhati says that the court has heard the entire case
 ab yah jaj par nirbhar karata he ki vah maamle kii sunwaayee karenge yaa nahin
 He says it is a matter of suspension of sentence, not a regular bail case
 unka kahana tha ki transfar ke baavjood jaj kaa faisla sunaanaa thik nahin
 Please tell that the Judge of Jodhpur Sessions Court, Ravindra Kumar Joshi, who is hearing the petition, has been transferred
 rajasthan hai court ne der raat 87 jajon ke ekamusth tabadalon kaa aadesh jari kiya he, jisamen joshi kaa naam bhi shaamil he
 This transfer is important because Salman Khan's bail is to be heard in Jodhpur Sessions Court at 10:30 am today
 shuukravaar ko bel par sunwaayee karte hue jaj rabindra joshi ne faisla surakshit rakh liya tha or ab unka transfar sirohi ho gaya he
 Chandrakumar Songra, now the new judge of the Jodhpur Sessions Court, will replace Chandrakumar Joshi
 aise main is baat par suspence bana he ki maujuuda jaj kaa tabadalaa hone ke baad bel par sunwaayee koun karegaa
 However, according to the information it is coming out that Chandrakumar will not handle the charge today
 agar aisi sthiti banati he or joshi bhi sunwaayee nahin karte hai to mumkin he ki bel yachika kisi or court ko transfar kar di jaae
 This has been happening in the routine
 ye transfar isliye ahm he kyonki shuukravaar ko jaj rabindra joshi ne jamaanat par bahes ke dauraan ye tippanee kii thi, wo court order ko tafsil se dekhenge or unhonesalmaan ke vakilki tamaam daleel sunne ke baad bel par faisla aaj tak ke liye taal diya tha
 In such a case, instead of Ravindra Joshi, the new judge Chandra Kumar is heard on Bell or if the bail petition goes to some other court, then there is also the possibility that Salman may not get relief even today
 vakeelon kii ryhalanki, varisht vakil keke manan kaa kahana he ki chunki jaj joshi ne kal (shuukravaar) faisla surakshit rakh liya tha, isliye zyada sambhaavna is baat kii he ki vahi aaj salmaan kii jamaanat par faisla sunaaen
 At the same time, Maishpal Bishnoi, advocate of the Bishnoi community in the black deer hunting case, says that such routine transfers have been done before in the month of April, so it is not fair to see it in any way
 baharhaal, abhi tak salmaan kii jamaanat par suspence kaayam he
 If Salman does not get bail today, he will have to spend at least two more days behind bars
 kal ravivaar hone kii vajah se sunwaayee nahin ho paaegi
 Hence today is a very important day for Salman and his family
 badaayun main baba sahab bhimrao ambedkar kii murti tode jane ke baad nai murti jab bhagava rang main lagi najar ai to bavaal much gaya
 Yogi Sarkar once again came into the dock because this time the color of the replaced idol was saffron
 isse pehle ki maamla saaf hota bavaal bad chukaa tha, lekin sachai saamne ai to pataa laga ki murti tode jane ke baad prashasan ne bispi ke sthaneey netaaon se madad lee thi or bispi ke jiladhyaksh ne nai murti ke rup main bhagava rang main rangi murti ko pasand kiya tha, jise agra se mangava kar lagavaaya gaya tha or isamen sthaneey logon kii sahmati bhi thi
 BSP leader administration came in the dock behind the saffron color, then the BSP district unit came forward to give clarification
 bispi ke jiladhyaksh ne pehle chitthee jari kar kaha ki yah murti unki sahmati se lagaai gai he or phir turant wo dal-bal ke saath murti ko rangane chal pade
 Within a few hours the idol of Baba Saheb Bhimrao Ambedkar was painted blue with saffron
 bispi ke jiladhyaksh hemendra gautam ne khud apane saathiyon ke saath jaakar murti ko bhagava se nila kiya

 BJP spokesman Chandramohan said that there is no role of administration in this

 The question is that when the idol was finally broken, why did the administration not install the idol itself and why this idol was installed with the help of political parties

 This decision gave divorced Muslim women a chance to celebrate

 Muslim women approached the Supreme Court against triple talaq, while All India Muslim Personal Law Board Tripartal was pleading in defense of divorce

 Court and government should not interfere in it
 lekin supreme court ne sunwaayee karte hue mangalvaar ko ek saath teen talaak ko khatm kar diya he
 The court said in its decision that the central government should enact laws in Parliament within 6 months
 supreme court main mukhya nyaayadhish je
 s
 khehar ke netritv main 5 jajon kii peeth ne apana faisla sunaaya
 In the court, three judges were in favor of declaring triple talaq as unconstitutional, while two judges were not in favor of it
 hamaare sutron ke mutabik court ke faisle ko lekar muslim personal lau board do dhadon main bant gaya he
 There is a section in this which is agreeable to the Supreme Court and is asking to be accepted
 to vahiin doosraa ek dhada he jo supreme court ke faisle ke se khush nahin he
 With this, he wants to take steps in the direction of pressuring the government by agitating across the country
 sutron ke maane to muslim personal lau board ke shiya gut supreme court ke paksh main he, to vahiin sunni gut is faisle ke khilaaf he
 Maulana Wali Rahmani, general secretary of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, who was the key party in the case of Tritlak, denied any comment on the decision of the Supreme Court and said that the board will sit together and decide the next step
 ol india shiya personal lau board ke pravaktaa moulana yasuub abbaas ne ucchtam nyaayalay ke aadesh kaa swaagat karte hue kaha ki ab desh main teen talaak ke naam par muslim mahilaon ke saath hone vaale anyaay ko roka ja sakegaa
 He said, there was no system of triple talaq in Hazrat Muhammad Sahab's time
 ham chaahate hai ki jis prakaar kanoon banaakar sati pratha ko khatm kiya gaya, vaise hi teen talaak ke khilaaf bhi sakht kanoon bane
 It is clear that the decision of the Supreme Court has divided the Muslim Personal Law Board into two factions

 is report ke jawaab main videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa raveesh kumaar ne kaha ki oechasiechaaar kii report kii agali kadi jammu kashmir kii sthiti par uske pichley jhuthe or raajnneeti se prerit vimarsh kii nirantarata bhar he
 He said that the things said in this report violate the sovereignty and territorial integrity of India and ignore the basic issue of cross-border terrorism
 kumaar ne kaha ki varshon se pakistan se jo seemapar aatankwaad chal rahaa he, usase utpann sthiti kaa or uski vajah se hone waalon hataahaton kaa hawala diye bagaiyr vishleshan kiya gaya he
 It is a hypothetical attempt to artificially equalize a nation that openly supports terrorism with the world's largest and vibrant democracy
 unhone kaha ki hamane maanavadhikaar ucchayukta karyaalay se is kadi ko lekar kadaa etraj jataayaa he
 Significantly, earlier this year, India had also rejected this report of the United Nations
 us dauraan bharat ne jammu-kashmir main maanavadhikaar ke hanan ko lekar sanyukt raashtra kii report ko bharat ne 'bhraamak' bataakar khaarij kar diya tha
 The Ministry of External Affairs had given a sharp response to the reports, saying that it was factually incorrect, for a specific purpose and under mischief
 ham is report kii manshaa par sawaal uthaate hai
 The Ministry of External Affairs had reacted strongly to this, saying that the report was completely motivated by bias and was trying to present the wrong picture
 gauratlab he kijari report main sanyukt raashtra ne kashmir main kathith maanavadhikaron ke ulanghan kii baat kahi thior is bare main antarrashtriya jaanch karaane kii maang kii thi

 But speaking of spinners, he is the only Indian cricketer to score a hat-trick in odis
 apana 9waan vanade khel rahe 22 saal ke kuldeep ne hetric lekar kangaaroon ke score ko 8 wicket par 148 kar diya
 Marcus Stoinis must have insisted, but the entire team 43

 Pakistani security agencies have warned the government about the growing threat of the dreaded terrorist organization 'islamic State' (IS)
 baluchistan kii prantiy sarkaar dwaara centre sarkaar or kanoon pravartan agenciyon ko bheji gai ek khufia report main pashchim asia ke is aatankwaadi sanghathan ke badhate prabhaav ke prati aagaah kiya gaya he
 This terrorist organization is called 'dash' in Arabic language
 'don' ne apni website par khabar di ki 31 aktubar kii is 'khufia soochna report' main kaha gaya ki aies ne kaibar pakhtoonkhwaa ke hongu jile or khurram kabaili jile ke 10 se 12 hajaar anuyaayiyon ko bhartee karne kaa daawa kiya he
 The report of the Department of Home and Tribal Affairs of Balochistan said that it has been reliably revealed that 'dash' has joined hands with some elements of lashkar-e-jhangvi (LAJ) and Ahl-e Sunnah Wal Jamaat (ASWJ) in Pakistan
 Has proposed dasha ne 10 sadasyeey ranneetik yojana shakha banaai he
 The LAJ and ASWJ are anti-shia organizations of Sunni Muslims
 is report main kaha gaya he ki aies ne uttari wajiristaan main sena nit abhiyaan ke jawaab main khabar pakhtoonkhwaa main sainya pratishthanon tathaa sarkari imaaraton par hamale tathaa alpsankhyak shiya samudaay ke sadasyon ko nishaanaa banane kii yojana banaai he
 However, the presence of the Islamic State has not yet been officially established
 uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaavon kii shuruyaat pashchimi uttar pradesh se ho rahi he
 In western Uttar Pradesh, the area is also called Jatland due to the abundance of Jats and Gurjars
 pashchimi uttar pradesh ke kareeb 27 jile aise hai jahaan jat or gurjar nirnaayak hai
 Let me tell you that in the last assembly elections in western Uttar Pradesh, Akhilesh Lehar got a tough fight from the BSP
 sapa-bispi main hui thi kadi takkar2012 ke aankadon ko dekhen to sapa ko 24, bispi ko 23, bijepi ko 13, areldi ko 9 or congress ko 5 siten mili thim
 The Math seat of Mathura came to bjp's account during the by-election
 vahiin mathura kii govardhan seat se areldi vidhayak ab bijepi main shaamil ho chuke hai
 In the same way, RLD mlas from Aligarh's Barauli Assembly have also joined BJP
 dhruvikaran kaa phayda bijepi ke haq messgast 2013 main hue mujffarnagar dange ke baad pashchimi uttar pradesh do virgon main banta hua najar aata he
 During the Lok Sabha elections in this part of the state, the effect of polarization was clearly visible
 hindu bahulya ilaaka hone ke chalate bijepi ko thodi raahat kii ummid he
 At the same time, Mayawati is engaged in cultivating dalit-muslim alliances
 maaya ne chali behtareen chalaupi main chunavi parinaam mudda aadhaarit kam jati aadhaarit zyada hote hai
 In UP, there is a common saying that "as much as one can share"
 pashchimi uttar pradesh ne mayawati ne bispi ke ummidavaar chun-chun kar utaare hai
 There are a good number of Jats, Muslims and Dalits in this region
 mayawati ne soshal ejineering ke naam par jaateey sameekaran saadhane kii puri koshish kii he
 Let me tell you that this time Maya has named 97 seats for Muslim faces
 areldi bhi he taiyaarpashchimi upi main majboot pakad vaali areldi apane bure daur main he
 The RLD had got a total of 9 seats in the last elections
 sapa-congress or areldi ke bich gathbandhan ke baad raajnneetik sameekaran kaaphi bade str par badal jaaenge
 Since the riots in Muzaffarnagar in August 2013, the Jats and Muslims had been divided, the RLD has been trying to reunite them for quite some time
 jat or muslim hi areldi ko voter rahaa he
 The alliance with SP will increase vote share and strengthen the winning claim
 sthaneey mudde rahenge baarividhansabha chunaavon main bijepi kii sthiti pashchimi uttar pradesh main behatar nahin rahi lekin 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main bijepi ne apratyaashit safalataa arjeet kii thi
 This support to the BJP in the general elections may dominate the social issues in the assembly elections
 pashchimi upi jat or muslim bahulya he to mudde bhi inhen virgon se jude hue honge
 The Muslim class has been the traditional vote bank of the SP, so the issues related to the Jat community may be overshadowed by the BJP in the elections
 aapako bataa den ki jat andolan se jujh rahi bijepi ke paas is kshetra se abhi 13 siten hai
 These are Dabadbamayawati, Kalyan Singh, General VK Singh, Ajit Chaudhary, Jayant Chaudhary, Sangeet Som, Ramveer Upadhyay, Suresh Rana, Jagdish Singh Rana, Rajendra Singh Rana, Raja Mahendra Aridaman Singh, Thakur Moolchand, Thakur Jayveer Singh, Sarvesh Singh, Vimala Solanki, Mahavir Rana, Ashu Malik, Gendalal Chaudhary and Pratap Singh Baghel

 SBI Chairperson Arundhati Bhattacharya has justified the provision of penalty for not keeping minimum balance in the account
 unhone kaha ki jandhan khaaton par aane vaale kharch kii bharpai ke liye aisa karnaa jaruri he
 He said that no formal information has yet been received from the government to reconsider the decision
 aisa kuch aayaa to vichaar ho saktaa he
 What rules did SBI enact? SBI, the country's largest public sector bank, has decided to recover the penalty for not having a minimum balance in a bank account once again after a gap of five years
 yah jurmaana 1 april se lagu hoga
 Apart from this, State Bank of India (SBI) has also changed the charge for other services including atms
 esbiai ke nae niyamon ke anusaar seaving acounts main teen baar cash jamaa karana nishulk rahegaa
 But after this, a charge and service charge of Rs 50 will have to be paid on every cash transaction
 vahiin karant acount ke maamle main yah charge adhiktam 20,000 rupee bhi ho saktaa he
 As per the new rules of SBI, if you do not keep the prescribed minimum average balance (MAB) in your bank accounts, a penalty of up to Rs 100 can be imposed every month and you will also have to pay service tax
 kaise lagegaa jurmaana?nae niyamon ke anusaar, emebi shulkabankshakha kii jagah ke hisaab se alag-alag ho saktaa he
 If the minimum balance in the account of the account holders of the urban area will be 75% of Rs
 5,000, then they will have to pay Rs
 100 as penalty and service tax thereon
 vahiin agar bakaayaa nunatam raashi ke 50 pratishat athwa usase bhi kam he to aisi sthiti main bank 50 rapaye or sarvice tex vasulegaa
 So in case of account holders in rural areas, this penalty may be minimal

 Divers can swim inside with oxygen cylinders, but it will not be possible for children to swim with cylinders for so long

 ’ The BCCI, while filing its reply in the Supreme Court, has opposed most of the recommendations of the Lodha Committee
 BCCI ne mangalvaar ko supreme court main daayar apane halafname main kaha ki BCCI ke kharche zyada hai
 Therefore it is necessary to show advertisements after every over because the expenses come out of these advertisements

 If people above 70 years of age live in BCCI, then their experiences will benefit BCCI
 isliye lodha cameti kii is sifarish ko bhi nahin mana ja saktaa ki 70 se zyada umr ke vyakti ko BCCI kaa sadsy nahin hona chahie
 At the same time, the BCCI has also opposed the recommendation of the Lodha Committee, in which they said that no minister can take the post of BCCI
 apane halafname main BCCI ne kaha ki aisa karnaa artical 93 kaa ulanghan hoga
 Article 93 says that no person can be prevented from becoming a member
 agar vah yogya he to
 The BCCI also said that it is not possible for one member from every state to join the BCCI
 gyaat ho ki justise lodha ne apni sifarish main kaha tha ki har rajya se ek sadsy BCCI kaa sadsy hona chahie

 Therefore, the recommendation of the Lodha Committee cannot be accepted that a person above the age of 70 should not be a member of the BCCI
 vahiin, BCCI ne lodha cameti kii us sifarish kaa bhi virodh kiya he, jisamen unhone kaha tha ki koi mantri BCCI kaa pad nahin le saktaa

 Kamal Nath was made the president of Madhya Pradesh Congress eight months ago
 jab unhen pradesh adhyaksh banaaya gaya, tab ye baat phir se charchaa main ai ki purv pradhanmantri indira gandhi unhen apana 'teesraa betaa' maanati thim
 In fact, once Indira Gandhi came to campaign for Kamal Nath, contesting from Chhindwara Lok Sabha seat
 indira ne tab chunavi raily main logon se kaha tha, 'kamalnath mere liye tisare bete jaise hai
 Please vote for them
 In 1979, Kamal Nath helped the Congress to compete with Morarji Desai's government
 kamalnath sanjay gandhi ke hostelmet the or apatkaal ke baad morarji desai kii sarkaar main unke liye jail bhi gaye the
 After 39 years, 72-year-old Kamal Nath has played a strong role in the Madhya Pradesh Assembly elections for Congress President Rahul Gandhi, now the grandson of Indira Gandhi
 kamalnath kaa safarkamalnath kii ginati desh ke diggaj rajanetaaon main hoti he
 Kamal Nath is one of the most eminent politicians that Madhya Pradesh has given to the country
 18 november 1946 ko uttar pradesh ke kanpur main janme kamalnath kii schuli padhai mashhoor doon skool se hui
 In the Doon School, he befriended Sanjay Gandhi
 doon skool se padhai karne ke baad kamalnath ne kolkata ke saint jevier college se bi
 Com done 27 janvari 1973 ko kamalnath alka nath ke saath shaadi ke bandhan main bandhe
 Kamal Nath has two sons
 unka bada betaa nakulanath raajnneeti main sakriy he
 Kamal Nath, who won the first election at the age of 34, has been elected to the Lok Sabha 9 times
 vah saal 1980 main 34 saal kii umr main chhindwara se pehali baar chunaav jite jo ab tak jari he
 Kamal Nath won consecutive elections in 1985, 1989, 1991
 1991 se 1995 tak unhone narsimha raav sarkaar main paryaavaran mantralay sambhala
 From 1995 to 1996, he was the Minister of Textiles
 1998 or 1999 ke chunaav main bhi kamalnath ko jeet mili
 With successive victories, Kamal Nath grew in Congress and was made the General Secretary in 2001
 vah 2004 tak party ke mahasachiv rahe
 Kamal Nath became the second name of victory in Chhindwara and in 2004 he won again
 yah lagaataar unki 7veen jeet thi
 He continued to get the reward of being closest to the Gandhi family and this time he again became a minister in Manmohan Singh's government and this time he got the Commerce Ministry
 unhone upie-1 kii sarkaar main puure 5 saal tak yah ahm mantralay sambhala
 After this, elections were held in 2009 and once again this veteran Congress leader was elected to the Lok Sabha
 chhindwara main congress kaa yah 'camel' lagaataar khilata gaya or is baar kii manmohan singh kii sarkaar main inako sadak parivahan or rajmarg mantralay mila
 In 2012, Kamal Nath became the Minister of Parliamentary Affairs
 madhya pradesh main mili thi ahm jimmedaarikamalnath kii ginati congress ke un netaaon main hoti he jo sankat ke samay main bhi party ke saath hameshaa rahe
 Whether it is Rajiv Gandhi's death, he remained with the party during the crisis that Congress was going through from 1996 to 2004, even when veteran leaders like Sharad Pawar had left the party
 26 april 2018 ko vah madhya pradesh congress ke adhyaksh bane
 He was made the chairman in place of Arun Yadav
 raajnneeti main kaise aae kamalnathkanpur main janme, dehradun or pashchim bengal main padhai kii lekin aisa kya hua ki kamalnath ko raajnneeti madhya pradesh se kerani padi
 Actually, Sanjay Gandhi, who comes from the country's largest political family, befriended Kamal Nath from West Bengal at Doon School
 doon skool se shuru hui ye dosti dhire-dhire paariwarik hoti gai
 After studying from Doon School, Kamal Nath reached St
 Xavier's College in Kolkata
 haalanki shahar to badal gaya lekin donon kii dosti zyada din dur nahin rah pai
 Kamal Nath has been close to the Gandhi family since the era of former PM Indira Gandhi
 kamalnath apana bijness badhanaa chaahate the
 In such a situation, these two friends of the Doon School once again came close
 kaha jaataa he immergency ke daur main kamalnath kii company jab sankat main chal rahi thi to usko isse nikaalane main sanjay gandhi kaa ahm role rahaa
 Sanjay Gandhi's image was as a flamboyant leader
 kamalnath indira gandhi ke is chote bete ke saath har vakt rahete the
 Elder son Rajiv Gandhi did not wish to enter politics
 aise main sanjay gandhi ko jarurat thi ek saath kii or ve the kamalnath
 The Congress was going through a bad phase since Emergency in 1975
 is daur main sanjay gandhi kii asamay maut ho gai thi, indira gandhi kii bhi umr ab saath nahin de rahi thi
 Congress continued to weaken
 kamalnath gandhi parivaar ke kareeb aa hi chuke the, ve lagaataar mehnat bhi kar rahe the
 He constantly stood with the party
 iskaa inaam unhen indira gandhi ne diya jab unhen chhindwara seat se tikat diya or raajnneeti main utaar diya
 Just after that, did Chhindwara become Kamal Nath and Kamal Nath became Chhindwara
 ve tab se lagaataar is seat se chunaav jitate aa rahe hai
 He has lost this seat only once
 yah ilaaka kamalnath kaa garh ban chukaa he
 He won this seat even when the Congress performed its worst ever in 2014
 chhindwara ke voters ne kamalnath ko sirf ek baar niraash kiya he jab 1997 main unhen purv siem sundar laal patwa ke haathon haar mili thi
 In 1996, his wife contested the elections in place of Kamal Nath and won

 On his blog, Advani wrote that the withdrawal of the ordinance related to tainted public representatives by the cabinet is another ugly chapter in the unflattering history of the UPA government
 adwani ne kaha ki adhikansh media khabaron main is puri ghatana ko rahul kii jeet ke taur par dikhaaya gaya he
 This shows how superficial the media has become these days

 is kaary kaa uddeshy puri tarah purna ho saktaa tha yadi rahul keval saadhaaran rup se kehete ki sarkaar dwaara liye gaye faisle kii samiksha kii jarurat he
 Advani said that President Pranab Mukherjee called the ministers of Congress and informed them about their objections to the ordinance
 raashtrapati dwaara bagaiyr hastakshar ke adhyadesh ko waapas kar dena sarkaar ke liye ek bahut bada jhatka sabit hota
 Hence Rahul Gandhi was used to fulfill this objective
 apane blog par adwani ne likhaa ki cabinet dwaara daagi jan pratinidhiyon se sambandhit adhyadesh ko waapas lenaa samprag sarkaar ke ankarshak itihaas kaa ek or badsoorat adhyay he
 Advani said that most media reports have shown this entire incident as Rahul's victory
 isse saaf he ki aajkal media kitna satahi ho gaya he
 The comments adwani ne likhaa ki sonia ji ne chhavi sudhaar ke liye rahul kaa upyog kiya
 The objective of this task could have been fully fulfilled if Rahul had simply said that the decision taken by the government needs to be reviewed
 adwani ne kaha ki raashtrapati pranab mukherjee ne congress ke mantriyon ko bulaakar adhyadesh ke prati apni aapattiyon kii jaankaree unhen di
 Returning the ordinance without a signature by the President would have been a major setback for the government
 isliye rahul gandhi ko is uddeshy ko puraa karne ke liye istemaal kiya gaya
 Advani said that most media reports have shown this entire incident as Rahul's victory
 isse saaf he ki aajkal media kitna satahi ho gaya he

 adwani ne kaha ki raashtrapati pranab mukherjee ne congress ke mantriyon ko bulaakar adhyadesh ke prati apni aapattiyon kii jaankaree unhen di
 Returning the ordinance without a signature by the President would have been a major setback for the government
 isliye rahul gandhi ko is uddeshy ko puraa karne ke liye istemaal kiya gaya
 Advani wrote that Soniaji used Rahul for image correction
 is kaary kaa uddeshy puri tarah purna ho saktaa tha yadi rahul keval saadhaaran rup se kehete ki sarkaar dwaara liye gaye faisle kii samiksha kii jarurat he
 Advani said that President Pranab Mukherjee called the ministers of Congress and informed them about their objections to the ordinance
 raashtrapati dwaara bagaiyr hastakshar ke adhyadesh ko waapas kar dena sarkaar ke liye ek bahut bada jhatka sabit hota
 Hence Rahul Gandhi was used to fulfill this objective
 adwani ne kaha ki raashtrapati pranab mukherjee ne congress ke mantriyon ko bulaakar adhyadesh ke prati apni aapattiyon kii jaankaree unhen di
 Returning the ordinance without a signature by the President would have been a major setback for the government

 In the final, Nadal easily defeated Thomas Burdick 6-3, 7-5, 6-4 in straight sets

 unhone 5 french open or ek austrailian open trophy apane naam kii he
 It has been a month of demonetisation
 is ek maheene main bhadohi kii karpet industry main notebandi kaa asar saafe dikh rahaa he
 The speed of the business has reduced, because the cash daily wage laborers are not coming to work due to money, due to which the goods could not be ready
 asar isliye bhi zyaada padaa, kyonki ye inkaa peak sijan he
 The carpets that were being prepared for the overseas expo in January were half-finished, due to which they could suffer big losses
 55 saal ke tanwir hossain bhadohi ke sabase puraane exporter main se ek hai
 They have an annual turnover of about Rs 12 crore, but they are very worried today, because of the goods that were to be prepared for the biggest expo in January, only two samples are ready, while 11 are yet to be ready
 tippaniyan Tanveer says that this is our peak season
 kuch maal taiyaar ho rahaa he, wo dile ho rahaa he or jisase hamaara shipment dile ho rahaa he
 Expo takes place in the month of January whether it is Germany or America
 vahaan saal bhar kaa order miltaa he, lekin jab maal hi nahin jayega to kaam kaise hoga
 Like Tanveer, the second exporter is Abdul Rab
 abdul rab ne apane maal ko taiyaar karaane ke liye apane kaarigaron ko check se pement kiya
 There is only one worker Naeem, who has a salary of Rs 7,000 and has an account with Canara Bank, but no ATM
 check se mili paise ko nikaalane ke liye kai din line main lage, lekin paisa nahin mil paaya or is bich kaam par bhi nahin aa paae
 Abdul Rab says that there are about 900 exporters in Bhadohi, who have a turnover of about 7,000 crores in a year and it has 1
5 million people, who mostly do not know about the card and cashless system
 kaaleen udyog kii antim kadi un bunakaron kii he, jo gaanv main rahete hai or haath se notted or handloom par kaaleen kii banaai karte hai, jinaki bazaar main maang bahut hoti he
 Among them are weavers Vijay and Shyam, whose fingers are engaged in making knotted carpets, but on the mind money, because they are just getting some kind of food and money from their owner
 lihaaja ye log chaahate he ki jald paisa bazaar main aae, jisase unka kaam chal sake
 55-year-old Tanveer Hussain is one of Bhadohi's oldest exporters
 inkaa taqariban 12 karod rupee kaa salanaa turnover he, lekin wo aaj behad chintit he, kyonki janvari main lagane vaale sabase bade expo ke liye jo maal taiyaar karnaa tha, usamen se sirf do sample taiyaar hai, jabaki abhi 11 taiyaar hone ko baaki hai
 The comments tanwir kehete hai ki ye hamaara peak sijan he
 Some goods are being prepared, they are being delayed and due to which our shipment is being delayed
 janvari ke maah main chaahe germany ho yaa america, vahaan expo lagate hai
 There is a year-long order, but how will the work when the goods do not go
 tanwir kii tarah hi duusare exporter abdul rab hai
 Abdul Rab paid his artisans by check to get their goods ready
 isamen hi ek varkar naeem hai, jinaki pagaar 7,000 rupee he or unka acount kenra bank main he, lekin atm nahin he
 It took several days in line to withdraw the money received from the check, but could not get the money and in the meantime could not even come to work
 abdul rab bataate he kii bhadohi main takreeban 900 exporter hai, jo ek saal main lagbhag 7,000 karod kaa turnover karte hai or isse 15 lakh log jude hue hai, jo zyaadaatar card or cashlesh vyavastha ko nahin jaanate
 The final link in the carpet industry is that of the weavers who live in the village and make hand-knotted and handloom carpet, which is in great demand in the market
 inamen hi bunakar vijay or shyaam hai, jinaki unglia to notted kaaleen banane main lagi hai, lekin dimag paise par, kyonki inhen abhi inke maalik se bas kisi tarah khaanaa-khuraqi kaa hi paisa mil rahaa he
 So these people want that the money will come in the market soon, so that their work can go on

 nabbe ke dashak main jab gagan gil, anamika, savita singh or katyayani jaisi kavyitriyaan samakaleen hindi kavita ke paridrishy par ai thi, tab unhone kavita main purushon kaa varchasv tod diya tha
 By changing the poetry of Hindi poetry, he had enriched Hindi with a different craft, language and subject than men's poems
 uske baad 21veen sadi main nirmala putul, devayani bharadwaj, leena malhotra raav, babusha kohli jaisi anek kavyitriyon ne stri vimarsh ko nayaa aayam diya
 In this way, the predominance of female voice began to appear in contemporary Hindi poetry
 is ubhaar ke kaaran aaj kareeb bisek kavyitriyaan in dinon sakriy hai
 Within a year or two, collections of many more poems have emerged, including Anuradha Singh, Sujatha, Rashmi Bhardwaj, Swati Shweta and Prakriti Kargeti
 in sabhi yuva kavyitriyon ke pratham sangrah aas-paas hi prakashit hue hai jinhone samakaleen kavita premiyon kaa dhyaan apni ore khinchaa he
 These poets are also active on social media and also express their views from time to time and immediately intervene on the events happening in the society
 in paanchon kavyitriyon ke paas kavita ke alag-alag rang or bhavabodh hai par ek cheez jo saamaanya he vah yah ki ye sabhi pitrusatta ko chunauti detii hai tathaa stri ko har tarah ke shoshan se mukt kar unke adhikaron kii raksha kaa aahvaan karti hai tathaa stri ke jivan main sachche prem kii talash bhi karatin hai
 They also forge new definitions different from the traditional meanings of love marriage
 ishwar nahin, neend chahie anuraadhaa singh kaa sangrah stri vimarsh ko ek paripakv drushti se prastut karata he jisame gahare manoveg ke saath vinamr swar main stri kii asmita ko rekhaankit kiya gaya he
 They also ask the men society what they want from women
 yani kavyitri stri se tamaam tarah kii apeksha karne vaale purushon ke saamne prashn karte hue kahati hai—vah har bhoomika main tumhaare bheetar chipa / premi dhundhati hai / tum jane kya-kya chaahate ho stri se
 Anuradha also says in her poem that the misery of women is so deep that they no longer want to tell anyone, they want to fight their battle alone
 ve bazaar or dharm tathaa rajnatik shaktiyon kaa bhi tiraskaar karti hai
 Brahmasatya, i was better then, Khurdabin, Srishti which we composed, in many poems like Anuradha's concerns can be seen
 mahadevi verma kii nir bhari badali kaa durukh aaj bhi jari he
 In this sense, she also associates herself with that tradition, but this sorrow does not only evoke compassion but also distracts the reader
 anuraadhaa kii kavita main pathakon ke saath ek gahari atmiyata ke saath-saath ek snehil lagaav bhi he
 There is no performance of any kind in them
 ve ekant bhav se kavita rachati hai jiname koi shor-sharaaba yaa hadabadi nahin he
 Her poetry also has political meanings which are reflected in her idiom but she says those political meanings in a poetic manner
 unke sangrah kaa sheershak hi samakaleen raajnneeti kaa ek vaktavy he unhen ishwar nahin, neend chahie
 They are familiar with the unrest created by the nexus of religion and state, so they need sleep which gives deep relief to man
 anuraadhaa kii kavita bhi pathakon ko ek sukun detii he
 Sujatha is also a poet of metropolitan sensation like Anuradha but slightly different
 unke liye kavita anantim maun ke bich he
 But there is also resistance
 unki kavita kaa sheershak hi pratirodh he jisamen ve ek nadi ke bheetar chattan kii tarah khud ko vyakt karti hai
 Their fight begins at home as the house is a nightmare
 ve ghar main faile is ret ko hataakar prem khojati hai
 He is also sad, but his purpose is not to awaken compassion
 anuraadhaa apni kavita main jo sawaal karti hai ek stri se tum kya chaahate ho, sujatha uskaa jawaab apni kavita ausat aurat main detii hai
 She says — you want an average woman / not too much / just like salt / her tongue / her heart / her dreams
 
 
 sujatha ek sampurna stri ke paksh main hai
 She also says - a rare moment for the body and mind to become solitary / to take / become a whole woman
 in sabhi kavyitriyon main deh se pare prem kii avikal khoj dikhaai detii he
 Sujata has an indomitable confidence and desire for struggle
 ve nahin maruungi jaisi kavita se pitrusatta ko chunauti bhi detii hai
 Her poem is a poem of a fearless woman like Katyayani
 ve yah bhi kahati hai—roti ko gol bana sakane ke liye / chahie hota he anant dhairya / bananaa padataa he ek stri
 This poem by Sujata reminds me of the poems of Anamika, which speak of the infinite patience of a woman
 rashmi bharadwaj apane sangrah ek atirikt a main striyon ko lekar samaaj main gadhi gai kahaniyon ko anaavruth karti hai
 One of her famous poems is characterless, in which she exposes the mindset of a male society in which women who fight for their rights are described as characterless
 rashmi ne bhi anuraadhaa or sujatha kii tarah is pitrusatta par prashn kiye hai
 His collection also contains many poems about love
 striyon ke prem main purush kaviyon ke prem kii deh lipsaa yaa kori bhavukta nahin he
 Rashmi has written in her role, "my writing will be meaningful only if my restlessness, my search is not limited to me
 uskaa kuch ansh aap tak pahunche
 "in Rashmi, the God is different from the God of Anuradha
" vah nakaaratmak nahin balki sakaaratmak arthon main he
 She says - to insist on childhood is the insistence of God / 
 
 
 bachapan ko rachana pratirodh he ishwar kaa
 Swati Shweta in her collection Yeh Din Curfew Hai writes the agony of the country with anger and sorrow
 unki kavita kii bhashaa or muhaavarey anuraadhaa, rashmi or sujatha se alag hai
 They create a different craft from the accepted craft of contemporary poetry, so they may not have that skill but they are aware and committed to their narrative
 yuddh jari rahegaa kavita main ve sujatha kii tarah drudh swar main apni baat kahati hai
 Language is a bit rough here or here, she says that she pays less attention to her language under the pressure of scripture
 prakruti kargeti hindi kii sabase yuva kavyitri hai jinka pehla sangrah shahar or shikaayatein aayaa he
 They are looking for their new poetic language and craft
 lekin ve bhi apni kavitaaon main stri ko shabd rup dene kii baat kahati hai kyonki shabd main hi abhivyakti he
 They also have curtains of silent people in which they try to find untold things as well
 neend tairti rahi, ab ham bachche to nahin, tumhaari izzat nahin main, but ke andar or gaalib uthta he apni kabr se jaisi kavitaaon se ek sambhaavnashil kavyitri ke sanket milte hai
 These five poets advocate for expressing life openly
 yah nai stri kii asmita or nayaa vimarsh he

 mohali test ab do din dur khadaa he
 After the defeat in the T20 and ODI series, at least one thing is being considered before the Test - that the Indian team management does not want to make any concession on the pitch
 lekin sabko ye bhi maaloom he ki saamne he duniya kii number van team - aise main bade daawey bhi nahin kiye ja rahe
 That is, the players will get the turning track in the Mohali Test, this thing is almost certain
 team management ke saath kai purv cricketer or exparts maanate hai ki isamen koi galat baat bhi nahin he
 The home team gets the benefit of the home ground

 Sharmisthan said that on the one hand the government is making rhetoric about the safety of women and girls, on the other hand it also stops the centers running in the interests of women and girls without thinking

 This time also the alliance is claiming its victory
 yogi adityanath bhi shikast ke baad behad chaukanne najar aa rahe hai

 lekin is bar donon hi factor par party ne jamkar kaam kiya he
 According to state BJP sources, "celebrity status of candidate Ravi Kishan will be effective in turning victory into a big victory

 Patanjali Yogpeeth sources said that Baba Ramdev, along with his supporters and followers, sat on the satyagraha at the Yagyashala of Yogpeeth late last night
 dilli main samarthakon ke khilaaf police kii karrwai ke baad yoga guru ne kal noida main apana satyagrah shuru karne kii koshish kii lekin unhen uttar pradesh main pravesh kii anumati nahin di gai
 Officers stopped him at the Burahari police post on the border of Muzaffarnagar district and asked him to return to Uttarakhand
 baad main ramdev patanjali yogapith laut aae or der raat apana anshan shuru kiya
 The yoga guru said that his 'satyagraha' would continue until the central government acceded to his demand to end corruption and bring back black money
 ramdev ne kal kaha tha, ‘kisi ko bhi kanoon kaa ulanghan nahin karnaa chahie or isliye main dilli nahin ja rahaa hum
 i was also not allowed to go to Noida in Uttar Pradesh
 ab yah (anshan) yahaan hoga
 He said that the government cannot stop him from coming to Delhi for more than 15 to 30 days and he will soon visit the national capital

 'gujarat's eye is the star - Saputara, there is no one to talk to at this hill station except the clouds' This is a line taken from that one minute five second ad film, which Amitabh Bachchan shot for Gujarat Tourism Have done isamen koi shaq nahin he ki saputara gujarat ke ankhon kaa tara he
 a hill station located in Dang district for a common Gujarati or especially Suratwasi, it is a base for them to loot the fun in Vikand
 picnic spot he
 Why not, when it is the only hill station in Gujarat
 lekin saputara se thodi hi duuri par sthit navagaanv main rah rahe 270 daang pariwaron ke liye is jagah ke myne badal jate hai
 For them, Saputara is like that tease, which has been rising within them for years
 us mahal kii tarah he, jo inaki jameen par bana, bina inaki marji ke bana or ab ye sab log us mahal kii chakri karte hai
 Before 1970, Saputara and Nawagaon were not identified
 ek hi naam tha-junagaanv
 Then there were 42 houses of Dang tribals in Junagaon and they lived there comfortably
 lekin saal 1970 main in 42 daang pariwaron ko vahaan se hataa diya gaya or tab astitv main aayaa, saputara
 This is a hollow development journey established by that human destruction
 iske saath hi junagaanv kaa astitv mit gaya or vahaan rahane vaale daang adivasee usase thodi dur par bas gaye jo kahalaaya, navagaanv
 The question arises that when the tribals living for years were removed from their land, in what way? Did they agree with him? Was he removed in a respectful manner? Or were the tribals ready to move away from themselves? Where was the plan to settle all the tribals before they were removed? In what circumstances are they living today? Ratan Bhai Hari Bhai Gangulke is answering all these questions
 kyonki unhone wo vakt dekha he, jab yah visthaapan hua tha
 Hari Bhai does not know Hindi
 wo apni baat dangi boli main rakhte hai, jise basti ke ek ladke ne hindi main anuwaad kiya he
 He says, 'when we were removed it was a rainy season
 ham vahaan se uthanaa hi nahin chaahate the; us jamaane main zyada log padhe nahin the, so unhone sabase jabardastee angootha kaa nishaan liya tha or phir police ne aakar jabardastee hamaare ghar kaa chappar tod ke hamen hataaya tha
 The Congress was in that displacement and Hitendra Kanhaiyalal Desai was the Chief Minister

 With this, the stove of his house burns
 navagaanv main inke 270 parivaar hai or puure jile ke 311 gaanvon main se yahi ek aisa gaanv he, jiske paas kheti ke liye koi jameen nahin he
 They do not have any rights on the land on which they are currently settled
 visthaapan ke baad se hi ye log sarkaar se maang kar rahe hai ki kam-se-kam jahaan ye rah rahe hai, us jameen ko to inke naam se kar diya jaae, lekin abhi tak safalataa nahin mili he
 Ramu Bhai says, 'where are we asking for more from the government? rahane ke liye ghar or khaane-kamaane le liye thodi jameen hi to maang rahe hai
 But not too much is being found
 ulate kuch saal pehle ek or sarkari notice mila he, jisamen yah jameen bhi khaali karne ke liye kaha gaya he
 Because for tourists, the government is trying to build a park here
 ’apni maang ko lekar is samudaay ke kuch log saal 2012 main mukhyamantri narendra modi se mili bhi the or unhone bharosa dilaayaa tha ki wo navagaanv kaa kuch karenge
 Ramchandra Chiman Huds tells about that, 'we went to meet
 modi ji se saamne-saamne mili the
 He also gave a letter
 bole the ki kaam ho jayega
 The file will run, but where has anything happened till date? Do not know where the file is going? Electricity reaches these families

 The BJP and Shiv Sena were formed in 1989
 ye wo vakt tha jab shivasena kii kaman uske sansthaapak bala sahib thakare ke haathon main thi, jo hindutv kaa bada cheharaa the
 The alliance of BJP and Shiv Sena also progressed on the idea of hindutva
 bala sahib thakare ke jinda rahane tak donon partiyaan kaa gathbandhan badastoor chalata rahaa lekin 2012 main unke nidhan ke baad jab 2014 main vidhansabha chunaav hue to shivasena or bijepi alag ho gayi
 Both parties contested the assembly elections on their own
 haalanki, baad main shivasena devendra fadanvis ke netritv vaali sarkaar main shaamil ho gai
 The Shiv Sena has been criticizing even while in government
 Interestingly, the Shiv Sena under the leadership of Devendra Fadnavis has been in the government of Maharashtra for five years, but its leaders have not missed an opportunity when the BJP and the government have not been criticized
 yahaan tak ki centre kii modi sarkaar par tippanee karne se bhi shivasena netaa peeche nahin rahe
 50-50 formula set in the coalition, despite five years of sourism, BJP and Shiv Sena fought the 2019 Lok Sabha elections together
 haalanki, shivasena ne 50-50 formule ke tahat satta kii baraabar bhagidaari kii shart par hi saath chunaav ladane kaa faisla liya
 But when the assembly election results came in October, the Chief Minister's post BJP and Shiv Sena clashed
 shivasena ne 50-50 formule main dhai-dhai saal mukhyamantri ke pad kaa vaada yaad dilaayaa, to bijepi kii taraf se fadanvis ne do took kah diya ki aisa koi vaada tha hi nahin
 Therefore, both the parties got fed up on this, as a result of which the BJP had to say that it could not form the government on its own despite getting the offer of the Governor
 10 november ko bijepi ke is elaan ke turant baad maharashtra main siyaasi sameekaran badal gaye or ensipi ne shivasena ko sarkaar banane ke liye samarthan dene par shart rakh di
 The NCP said that the Shiv Sena will have to withdraw from the NDA and its minister will have to resign from the Modi cabinet

 JDU spokesman Sanjay Singh said that the BJP is an arrogant party
 sanjay singh ne is baat ko puri tareeke se nakaara ki prashanth kishor ne jadyu ke paksh main chunaav main hastkshep kiya
 He said that if he had interfered in the electoral process, JDU would have won five seats

 To realize Balasaheb's dream, Uddhav Thackeray broke his 25-year-old friendship with the BJP and joined hands with his rival ncp-congress
 shivasena shanivaar ko sarkaar banane kaa daawa pesh karti, lekin usase pehle hi sharad pavaar ke bhattije ajit pavaar ne ensipi ko todakar balasaheb ke sapane ko chakanachur kar diya

 Ajit Pawar is the leader of NCP Legislature Party
 aise main vidhayak dalon ke hastakshar kiye hue samarthan patr bhi unheen ke paas tha
 In such a situation, he has decided to support BJP, leaving behind all NCP leaders including Sharad Pawar

 This means that Ajit Pawar has managed to form the government by breaking the NCP
