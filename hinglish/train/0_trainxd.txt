 unhone sthaneey graminon kii madad se puraa maal thikaane laga diya
 As soon as the news was received, the force was sent to the spot
 CRPF ne abhi is baat kii jaankaree nahin di he ki aakhir kitni maatra main or kitni rakam kaa maal naksali le ude
 CRPF officers in the Dhur Naxalite affected areas Burkapal and Chintagufa area had sent huge amounts of ration in the evening
 wo is baat se bekhbar the ki raste main koi anhoni ho sakati he
 Grain and daily use materials purchased from the local market were loaded into vehicles
 afasaron ne vaahanon main savaar driveron or duusare karmiyon ko niyat sthaan main maal pahunchane kii jimmedaari saunp di
 After the goods left, the officers also got relaxed
 duusare din bhi maal jab baiyrakon main nahin panhucha, to vaahanon kii padtaal shuru hui
 Vehicles were also found within the forest and drivers were also found but the vehicles were not found
 poochtacha main pataa chalaa ki bandook kii nok par naksaliyon ne vaahanon ko apane kabje main le liya tha
 Generally, in the rainy season, not only the Naxalites, but also the police and the central security forces, the provision of food items is a big challenge
 suraksha balon ke camp or barrack behad jangalon main hai
 The movement here comes to a standstill during the rainy season
 junglee nadi naale aksar ufaan par hote hai
 Therefore, as the weather opens, the security forces personnel are busy in securing food and daily use for themselves
 kuch isi tarah kipristhitiyaan naksaliyonke saamne bhi hoti hai
 Although they depend on the local villagers for this, but sometimes they also have to make papad for food items
 sukama, dantewada, bijapur, bhopalpatnam samet kai ilaakon main javaanon kaa rashan luutane kii ghatnaayen pehle bhi hoti rahi hai
 It is clear from the incident of looting of ration of Naxalites that they had already got news about this
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki maukey par aadha saikadaa ke lagbhag naksali or sthaneey graminon ne vaahanon ko roka tha
 Recently, a letter was issued by Naxalite leader Situ Nemilitary Battalion informing one of his commanders that the Naxalites have run out of ration
 is patr main rashan bhijwane kii vyavastha karne kii baat kahi gai thi
 The letter was placed in the hands of the police during an encounter

 His servant was also involved in the murder of Abhijeet Yadav alias Vicky, son of Bapatiramesh Yadav of Uttar Pradesh Legislative Council
 police ne somvaar ko use bhi giraftaar kar liya
 Actually, the house servant was absconding since this famous murder
 police shiddat se uski talash kar rahi thi
 Ramesh Yadav's 24-year-old son Abhijeet Yadav alias Vicky died suddenly in mysterious condition on the night of 20 October
 is hatya kii mukhya aaropee mritak kii maa mira yadav he
 Who is currently in jail due to 14 days judicial custody
 ab naukar kii giraftaar se yah maamla sulajhata najar aa rahaa he
 The police servant is making inquiries
 ye tha puraa maamlavardaat ke din yani 21 oktober kii subahalakhanumen vidhaan parishad ke sabhapati ramesh yadav ke ghar main der raat unke bete kii maut ho jaati he
 Police reach home in the morning
 par maa police ko ye kah kar bhej detii he ki bete ko raat ko dil kaa daura padaa tha jisaki vajah se uski maut ho gai
 But the post mortem report shows that the death is not due to heart attack but due to strangulation
 shaq maa par jaataa
 The mother is caught
 katl kii baat bhi kabool kar leti he
 But then within a few hours, she says that she has not murdered the son but someone else
 or yaheen se lakhanu police kii uljhan shuru ho jaati he
 His mother first said- Abhijeet had chest pain
 phir kaha- alpaaayu kii bhavishyavaanee thi
 After this he said - i killed Abhijeet
 lekin kuch ghante baad kaha- mere upar jhootha aarope lagaaya gaya
 And then said that there is a conspiracy to kill Abhijeet
 maa hi nikali katilalakhanu se baahar ai ye ek ajeeb kahani he
 The women who have been caught by the police are not ordinary women
 balki upi vidhaan parishad ke sabhapati ramesh yadav kii duusari patni mira yadav hai
 Along with being a wife, Meera Yadav is also the mother of two young sons of Naresh Yadav
 unheen do beton main se 24 saal ke ek bete abhijit kii 20 oktober kii raat achaanak rahasyamayi haalat main maut ho jaati he
 The mother says that there was a sudden pain in the son's chest and he died
 darasal, lakhanu ke daarulashafa ke bi-block ke flats number-137 se 21 oktober kii subah-subah sabase pehle yahi khabar baahar ai thi ki abhijit kaa dil kaa daura padane se maut ho gai
 The police also got the news
 ab chunki maamla vidhanparishad ke sabhapati ke bete kii maut kaa tha, lihaaza police bhi ghar pahunch gai
 But then the police was sent off saying that Abhijeet's death was natural
 khud maa dil kaa daura padane kii gavaahi de rahi thi
 Now the mother herself was saying, so there was no scope for doubt
 police ke jane ke baad abhijit kii arthi taiyaar kii gai or shav yatra shmashaan ke liye nikal padi
 But before the funeral could be held, suddenly the police once again arrived
 is baar police kisi kii nahin sunati or arthi apane kabje main lekar shav ko postmortem ke liye bhej detii he
 The post-mortem report came after the strangling killing, and the whole story changed
 pataa chalaa ki abhijit kii maut seene main tej dard yaa dil kaa daura padane se nahin balki galaa ghonte jane kii vajah se hui he
 That is, he has been murdered
 to phir maa ne jhooth kyon bolaa? bas isi sawaal ne police ko mauka de diya abhijit kii maa ko giraftaar karne kaa
 Here, Abhijeet's mother falls under the grip of the police and immediately narrates another story
 is baar kahati he ki usee ne apane bete abhijit ko chunni se galaa ghont kar maar diya
 Because Abhijit had returned home drunk at night and tried to misbehave with her
 maa ke ikbaal-e-jurm ke baad lakhanu police ne bhi chaiyn kii saans lee ki chalo ek hai profile murder cese jaldi sulajh gaya
 But now when the police reach Meera Yadav with the court, Meera immediately tells a new story
 or saath main ye bhi kahati he ki use is maamle main fansaaya ja rahaa he
 Within 24 hours, Meera Yadav, the second wife of Legislative Council Chairman Ramesh Yadav, had changed the statement 5 times
 magar ye samaj se pare tha ki jisane pehali police poochtacha main abhijit ko maarane kii baat ko kabool liya tha wo achaanak is maut ke peeche ab saazish kii baat kyon kah rahi he?jaise jaise vakt guzarataa ja rahaa he vaise vaise ye murder cese ab sachmuch mistry banataa ja rahaa he
 It was said earlier that Abhijeet was killed in Darulshfa's b-block Flat No
 137
 us vakt ghar main sirf uski maa mira yadav maujuud thi
 While elder brother Abhishek was not at home
 magar ab kaha ja rahaa he ki abhishek kii maut ke vakt bada bhai abhishek bhi ghar main hi maujuud tha
 So the police has now taken him into custody for questioning as well
 or to or mira yadav ne apane pati ramesh yadav par saazishan unhen fansaane kaa ilzaam bhi laga diya he
 However, till now the police are assuming that the murder of Abhijeet
 maa mira yadav ne hi kii he
 But now another angle has come in this matter of property dispute
 darasal vidhanparishad ke sabhapati ramesh yadav kii do patniyaan hai
 The first wife lives in Etah, UP with a daughter and Ekbaitha
 jabaki mira yadav ramesh yadav kii duusari patni hai jo daarulashafa ke bi-block ke flats number-137 main apane do beton abhishek or abhijit ke saath rahati hai
 Police are still investigating whether anyone else was present in the flat at the time of the murder
 vahiin is maamle main vidhanparishad ke sabhapati ramesh yadav kuch bhi bolne ko raji nahin he

 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne man kii baat main kashmir ke ek yuva bilal daar kaa naam liya tha
 Bilal, who hails from Bandipura in North Kashmir, has thanked PM Modi, but the financial crisis, Bilal has also demanded a job from Modi
 bilal ne modi se apil kii he ki wo use naukari dilaa de, kyonki uske parivaar ke paas aay kaa koi saadhan nahin he

 usne is saal 12 hajaar kilo kachra saaf kiya he
 "now know who is Bilal and why he is being praised
" 
 - Bilal Dar is a 18 year old garbage boy who earns money by cleaning garbage from Wular lake
 usne puri jhil ko saaf karne kaa bidaa uthaaya tha
 For the last 5 years, Bilal has been selling plastics from the lake and from this he earns 150-200 rupees a day
 is paise se uski maa or do bahanon kaa guzaara chalata he
 His father also used to do the same work, who died due to cancer in 2003
 - pita kii maut ke baad bilal ke kandhon par ghar kii jimmedaari aa gai or usne apni padhai bich main hi chhod di
 He did many things to help his family, but did not succeed and these works included repairing the car, tea shop etc
 uske baad usne jhil main hi kaam karnaa uchit samajha
 Bilal, who wastes plastic, debris like garbage, took away 12 thousand kilos of garbage
 uske baad use 15 july 2017 ko esemasi kaa brands ambesder banaaya gaya
 He was asked to supervise the entire mission and Bilal makes others aware of the cleaning
 bilal par ek documentry bhi banaai gai he, jise jalaal-u-din ne banaai he
 - Even though the government has made Bilal a brand ambassador, but even today, he is upset for two days' bread and is demanding a job from Prime Minister Modi

 Sushma said, 'the meeting was held in a very cordial atmosphere
 satta paksh or vipaksh donon ne ummid jataai ki gatirodh samaapt ho or sansad chale
 When both the parties want Parliament to run, it seems that the government will accept the demand of JPC and will come up with a proposal in this regard

 roopala ne congress par tanj kasate huekaha ki shaayad narendra modi ke naam kaa hi asar tha ki punjab kii janata ne congress par bharosa kar liya or party kii vahaan par sarkaar ban gai

 wips se hone vaali dikkat sirf bacchon ko hi nahin balki paryaavaran ke liye bhi ek khatra he
 These plastic wipes are not bio-degradable and take about 500 years to completely destroy
 vahiin eco-friendli wips paudhon ke fibre se bane hote hai or ye bahut hi mulaayam hote hai
 Also do not harm the environment
 agar europea deshon kii baat karen to vahaan plastic wips ko bain karne kii muhim chhidi hui he kyonki vahaan naale jam hone kaa mukhya kaaran ye wips hai
 While the use of wipes has become a common practice in today's environment, the problems caused by wipes have also increased

 When these wipes are used more, itching increases in the skin and other skin problems occur
 ye khaskar tab badhati hai jab rasayan mishrit wips se ham bachche ko ponch kar dhoop main rakh dete hai to ye saare chemicals surya kii roshni ke sampark main aakar pratikriya kar bacchon ko takalif pahunchaate hai

 ISIS, which has become the biggest enemy of peace in the world for almost two years, has now come on its knees
 syria ho yaa iraq apane har garh main use lagaataar shikast mil rahi he
 After the killing of its 45 thousand terrorists, it is now surrounded by all the remaining areas
 aise main aies ke paas ab bas do hi raste bache hai yaa to hathiyaar daal kar sarender kar de yaa phir goliyon kaa nishaanaa bane
 That is, the game of ISIS is going to be over
 jise kal tak log is duniya ke sabase kaufanaakatankwaadi sanghathanke taur par jaanate the, aaj kaayron kii ek aisi toli ban kar rah gai he, jise iraq or syria main jaan ke laale pad gaye hai
 The situation is that all its forts from Syria to Iraq have been broken and this terrorist organization is now taking the last hiccup
 iraq main iesas apane sabase bade garh or bagdadi kii islamic hukumat kii rajdhani mosul main hi ghutanon ke bal aa chukaa he, vahiin syria main wo 6 lakh 22 hazaar varg kilometre ke ilaake main alag-alag faujon se ghir kar panaah maang rahaa he
 The Iraqi military and the Kurdish fighters, along with the Allied forces led by the US, have badly captured ISIS
 haalat ye he ki aatankwaadiyon kaa peechha karti faujen ab iraqi shahar mosul ke ek bade ilaake main daakhil ho chuki hai
 Iraqi Prime Minister Haider Al Abadi has made it clear that now ISIS militants have only two routes to either surrender or be ready to die
 lekin jaankaron kii maane to fujen beshak ab iesas par haaavee ho chuki hon, lekin asli chunauti abhi baaki he kyonki mosul ke jin rihaayshi ilaakon main ab aage kii ladaai ladi jaani he, vahaan kareeb pandrah lakh logon kii aabaadi he
 And in such a situation, it is a difficult task to kill the terrorists while staying in the city
 fuj kii isi majaburi kaa phayda uthaa kar aatankwaadiyon ne bhi ab shahriyon ko dhaal banaakar chhupana shuru kar diya he
 On the go, they are also setting fire in oil wells, so that even if there is a waste, they will be able to escape by taking advantage of the smoke
 syria main kabhi sarkaar se khafaa logon ne iesas kaa saath diya tha, jab usiais or bagdadika asli cheharaa logon ke saamne aayaa, to log saham gaye the
 Now, with the help of Russia, the Syrian government has opened a front against Baghdadi, the common people have also entered the field against the terrorists with weapons
 haalat ye he ki jis raka or eleppo jaise shaharon main kal tak iesas kii marji ke bagair patta bhi nahin hilta tha, vahiin ab bagdadi kaa kila taash ke patton kii tarah hilne laga he
 In Syria and Iraq, the ISIS has undoubtedly started to break its feet, but the real battle is yet to come
 ye ladaai he iraqi shahar mosul kii, yahi wo shahar he jise bagdadi ne apni tathakthith islamic hukumat kii rajdhani ghoshit kar rakhaa tha
 But now the army has surrounded Mosul
 or apni maut qareeb dekh kar ye aatankwaadi ab is shahar ke 15 lakh begunaah shahriyon ko apni dhaal banane kii taiyaari kar rahe hai
 No one knows what will be the result
 iraqi shahar mosul se chand kilometre ke faasale par maujuud he toun bartela
 In this small town of Christians, ISIS had killed hundreds of people simply because they were not ready to change their religion
 lekin ab aatankwaadiyon kii ye zyaadati guzare kal kii baat ban chuki he
 The Iraqi Army has driven out the militants from Bertella

 ' iske saath hi unhonenithish ke faisle par naaraazgijataate hue kaha, 'bihar ke 11 karod logon ne ham par vishwaas kiya, unhone apana bharosa jataayaa
 It broke
 mujhe isse dukh hua he

 kya iphone main dual sim kii jarurat he? kya vajah he ki aipal dual sim iphone launch nahin karata? or kya aisa ho gaya jis vajah se aipal ko dual sim patent ke liye aavedan kii jarurat pad gai? aaie jaanane kii koshish karte hai
 It is a simple matter, dual sim smartphones are more prevalent in progressive countries like India
 ye isliye kyonki isse yugers paise bachaa sakate hai
 But currently the share of Apple iphone is very low in the Indian market and its target users in countries like America do not buy iphone to save money and they have nothing to do with dual sim
 yah na sirf aipal par lagu hota he balki samsung or motorola jaisi companiyaan bhi america jaise bazaar main single sim vairient launch karti hai jabik bharat or indonesia jaise deshon main usee smartphone kaa dual sim vairient lekar aati hai
 According to the report, Apple has applied for a patent for Dual SIM, in which its specialty has been stated
 isse ab un afvaahon ko bhi bal mil rah he ki iphone 8 kaa ek vairietu dual sim vaala hoga
 Why this? - Most users in India use dual SIM smartphones - Many big companies are launching dual SIM variants of their flagship smartphones in India
 - develping deshon main bad rahi he dual sim smartphone kii maang- hai and android smartphone ko takkar dene ke liye bhi aipal laa sakati he dual sim iphone
 - Dual SIM helps people to choose plans of different telecom companies
 - ek sim main network nahin to duusare se mobile yuj kiya ja saktaa he
 - Easy to take internet plan separately
 - bharat main aipal apana plant or aipal store kholane kii taiyaari main he
 Why users need dual sim smartphones: Cheap calling plans, cheap internetplan and better network are the biggest reasons for dual sim
 lekin yphone yugers kii katigari aamtaur par saste colling yaa internet plan ke bare main nahin sochataa
 Although Indian iphone users obviously think about the network and the plan
 aipal kyon nahin launch karata dual sim vaala iphone : zyaadaatar bazaar main aipal network prowider se kararak karke yphone bechata he jo locd hote hai
 For example, in India, iphone is sold with Airtel, in which you can only use Airtel's SIM throughout the year
 iske alaava yphone ko patala, halkaa or bydaree life zyada dene kii vajah se bhi dual aipal ne ab tak dual sim vaala smartphone launch nahin kiya he
 But now the market has changed and the users too
 khaskar aise vakt main jab aipal bharat main apana plant lagane kii taiyaari main he
 Obviously, if the plant is set up, then the Apple store will also open here and the iphone's share in the Indian market will also increase
 bharat ke alaava kai desh hai jahaan aipal kuch maamlen pichad jaataa he
 It is possible that due to this also, next year you may get to see dual sim variant of iphone

 The magazine said that Kasab's investigators feel that the terrorists have recieved their targets long before the attacks

 Kasab told investigators that he and his comrades were taken to sea at the start of training

 '' kuch din pehle yani id ke roj jis hafiz said ne laal kile par hamalaa karne kii dhamkee di thi, ab usee hafiz ne khud ko paak-saaf bataakar aisi patali maari he ki log hairaan ho gaye hai
 He says that he is not a terrorist at all and to prove his innocence, where he can also appear before the Joint Commission
 samaj main nahin aata he ki duniya ke sabase badnaam or khaufnak aatankwaadi hafiz mohammad said ke is taaje bayaan par koi hanse yaa roe lekin dehshat kii siyasat shaayad aise hi kore bayaanbajiyon ke sahare sire chadhati he
 That is why this person who has a reward of 10 million US dollars on his head has now left this new Shigufa
 insaan or insaaniyat to sharmasaar karanevaale is shaks ne pakistani kii aazaadee yani 14 november ke roj ek public meeting ke dauraan jo baaten kahin, use sun kar ab sirf hindustani agenciyaan, siyasatdan or awam hi hairaan nahin hai, balki uski is baat ne puri duniya ko chaunkaa diya he
 However, those in the know know that such rhetoric means nothing more than just trying to make a place in the hearts of their supporters
 aatankwaadi sanghathan jamaat-ud-daawa kii ore se pakistan ke punjab vidhansabha ke saamne rakhi gai ek raily main hafiz said ne ye kah kar ek nai bahes kii shuruuaat kar di ki wo naa sirf begunaah or paak-saaf he, balki apni begunaahi sabit karne ke liye wo kisi aise judicial kamishan ke saamne pesh hone ke liye bhi taiyaar he, jis judicial kamishan main hindustan or pakistan donon mulkon ke jaj shaamil hon
 However, seeing the supporters, Hafiz Saeed did not stop at all
 usne yahaan tak kaha ki agar uske khilaaf koi subut he, to hindustan use aatankwaadi sabit kar dikhaae
 However, Hafiz Saeed, who is aware of the working methods of Pakistan, is not surprised by these long-boasted boastings, because despite all the evidence from India in the 26 / 11 Mumbai attack case, not only Pakistan's high The Supreme Court has given a clean chit to Saeed in 2010 itself
 pakistan ke supreme court ne hindustan kii ore mili tamaam subooton kii andekhi karte hue kaha tha ki sirf suni-sunai baton or kayaasabaajiyon kii buniyaad par wo sarkaar ko said ke khilaaf kisi bhi tarah kii karrwai kii ijaajat nahin de sakati
 Obviously, all these things of Saeed , the government and the court's attitude there is like a fixed match and that is why till now no comment has been made on this new Shigofbaji from Saeed
 hindustan se khud ko aatankwaadi sabit karne kii baat kahanevaale hafiz said ne abhi kuch hi rose pehle paanch hindustani phogiyon kii jaan lekar apana asli rang dikhaaya tha lekin ab usne is vaardaat main bhi apana haath hone kii baat kah ek baar phir se logon kaa dhyaan khinchne kii koshish kii he, jabaki ab tak kii tafteesh saaf karti he ki pakistani fuj ne hafiz said ke uksaave par hi pichley 5-6 agast kii raat ko hindustan kii sarhad main daakhil ho kar paanch javaanon kii jaan lee thi
 Apart from all the boasting at the jamaat-ud-dawa rally in Pakistan's Punjab, Hafiz Saeed also said that he did not go to the Line of Control before the recent shootout on the outskirts, while at the time of his arrival in loc While talking, he was arguing in a mosque
 haalanki apni begunaahi kii in tamaam daleelon ke baavjood wo hindustan ke andruni maamalon main taang adaane se baj nahin aayaa
 He said that India should withdraw troops from Jammu and Kashmir
 vaise sirf isi maheene main nahin, isse pehle bhi hafiz said ke uksaave par hi pakistan ke phogiyon ne do hindustani javaanon kaa sir kalam kar kar diya tha lekin said naa to isse pehle khamosh tha or naa hi iske baad rukaa
 Rather, he is still roaming all over Pakistan against Hindustan and now Hafiz Saeed, who describes himself as innocent, had threatened to make a terrorist attack in India and especially Red Fort a few days ago
 haalanki hafiz said duniya or kanoon kii najar main kitna bada gunahagaar he ye sirf isi baat se samajha ja saktaa he ki duniya ke tamaam bade deshon ke saath-saath khud sanyukt raashtra sangh yani yuano tak ne use aatankwaadi qaraar diya he or wo naa sirf hindustan balki america ke most wanted aparaadhiyon kii fehrist main shaamil he
 Hafiz Saeed The pawn of the Pakistani government, which has some shadow in its mind and heart at all times, is India
 fark bas itnaa he ki uske dimag main hindustan ke liye sirf nafrat bhari he or or jubaan main tohamat
 The special thing is that this biggest attacker of Mumbai attack Hafiz Saeed sometimes embraces Yasin Malik, separatist leader of Kashmir, sometimes hugs Hindustan by instigating the Pakistani army but despite all international pressures, he does not just openly in Pakistan It turns around, but sometimes jihad sometimes hurts India with some other excuse
 hindustan ke khilaaf hafiz said ke man nafrat kii bel koi aaj nahin badi, balki ye beej uske man main tabhi pad gaya tha, jab donon mulkon kaa bantwaaraa hua
 Before partition, many of his family from Haryana were killed in the riots and since then he has chosen only one job and that was enmity with India
 lekin duniya ne hafiz said kaa naam tab pehali baar suna, jab usne 1990 main iesai kii madad se jamaat-ud-daawa ke jhande tale aatankwaadi sanghathan lashkar-e-taiyaba kii buniyaad rakhi
 After this, at the behest of Saeed, Lashkar has carried out several terrorist attacks in several areas of India including Jammu and Kashmir, and with each attack, Saeed has received notoriety
 13 disambar 2001 ko sansad par hue hamale main moulana masood ajahar ke saath jab hafiz said kaa naam bhi saamne aayaa, to use apane makasad main ek or kamyaabi mili
 After this, on 11 July 2006, the train blasts in Mumbai and the 26 / 11 Mumbai attacks also brought to mind Saeed's mind, but India could not do anything except talk of action against him
 had to ye rahi ki tamaam subooton ke baavjood pakistani court ne hafiz said ko is maamle main bari kar diya
 After this, Saeed was encouraged that it continued to grow
 is saal usne elosi par hindustani javaanon kaa sir kalam karavaaya or ab usne paanch phogiyon kii jaan le lee lekin itnaa hone ke baavjood philhal ye koi nahin bataa saktaa ki hindustan kaa most wanted aatankwaadi akhir kab hindustan kii jad main hoga

 supreme court ne is maang par sunwaayee karte hue yachika khaarij kar di
 Prior to this decision of the court, Election Commission sources said that polling officers are already working in increased hours, with the sunrise time varying in every state
 aise main agar matdaan suryoday se pehle shuru hoga to atirikt suraksha vyavastha or prashasnic badlaav karne honge

 bijepi ke liye ayodhya sirf vidhansabha kii ek seat nahin balki ek pratik he, jiske dam par usne desh ke raajnneeti main apana rath chalaaya tha
 When the BJP lost the Ayodhya seat in the 2012 assembly elections, the party's nose was literally cut off
 1991 ke baad bijepi ayodhya kii vidhansabha seat kabhi nahin haari thi
 But the last time Pawan Pandey defeated the BJP on the seat of Ayodhya and waved the Samajwadi Party flag
 aksar vivaadon main rahane vaale pawan pandey par akhilesh yadav ne ek baar phir se daanv lagaaya he
 Pawan Pandeshukwar, who is fighting again on behalf of SP, rallied in Ayodhya and praised Pawan Pandey fiercely and said that if the Samajwadi Party government is to be formed again, send Pawan Pandey vigorously
 isse pehle guuruuvaar ko ajam khan ne ayodhya aakar joardaar chunaav prachaar kiya tha or pawan pandey ke samarthan main musalamaanon se yah apil kar di thi ki bispi ko vot dene se to acha he ki musalmaan sidhe-sidhe bijepi ko hi vot de den
 This time the Samajwadi Party is not worried about winning Ayodhya
 ayodhya ke seat phir se jeetne ke liye samaajawaadee party ko yahaan ke muslim matadaataaon ke samarthan kii darkaar he
 But on the Ayodhya seat, Mayawati has played a bet like no one has tried
 bispi ne utaara muslim ummidavaarkai dashakon ke baad kisi badi party ne is seat par ek muslim ummidavaar utaara he
 Mohammad Bazmi Siddiqui, who contested on a BSP ticket, is a property dealer by profession and is a newcomer to politics
 lekin ghar-ghar gum kar vot maang rahe bazmi siddiki ko apni jeet kaa puraa bharosa he
 He says that when the votes of 45,000 Muslims of Ayodhya will be joined with Kimayawati's Dalit vote bank, no one can stop their victory
 apane chunaav prachaar main wo musalamaanon ko yaad dilaate hai ki mujffarnagar danga se lekar luutmaar kii sari ghatnaayen samaajawaadee party ke shasankaal main hi hui hai
 Annoyed by the selection of the candidate, the BJP has become a question of executive
 BJP has relied on business leader Ved Prakash Gupta this time to win the Ayodhyasit again
 lekin veda prakaash gupta kii sabase badi pahchaan yahi he ki wo isi ayodhya seat se samaajawaadee party or bispi donon se chunaav lard chuke hai
 He was a BJP candidate in the last assembly election
 party ke puraane kaaryakartaaon ko chhodkar ek dal badalu netaa ko tikat dene se bijepi ke logon main khaasi naaraazgi he
 Ved Prakash Gupta himself realizes this resentment and says in the election campaign that he has now returned home and will never leave the BJP
 ram naam nahin, modi ke naam kaa saharabijepi kevotaron se baat karen to vah saaf kehete hai ki unhen ummidavaar ko nahin balki modi ko vot dena he
 Ved Prakash Gupta's supporters go door-to-door campaigning with the slogan 'har har Modi, ghar ghar Modi' instead of 'jai Shri Ram'
 baat bilkul saaf he, ummidavaar bhi hawa kaa rukh bhaanp rahe hai or ram kii is nagari main bhi bijepi ko modi ke naam kaa hi sahaara he

 Hello, Ravish Kumar
 
 
 
 What is the difference between a group and a team? For this, the time has come to look into the legal provisions and traditions of Parliament, not any Hindi grammar book
 ek saamaanya raajnneetik jan kii is vishay main dilchaspee honi hi chahie ki kyon congress netaa vipaksh kaa pad maang rahi he or kyon sarkaar apni taraf se sakriy nahin dikh rahi he
 And what will happen when the Leader of Opposition will not be there in the 16th Lok Sabha
 itihaas par najar daalen to saal 1952 se lekar saal 1969 ke bich netaa vipaksh tha hi nahin
 In 1969, for the first time, Congress o is formed out of the Congress government, whose leader Ram Subhag Singh becomes the Leader of Opposition for the first time in the history of Lok Sabha
 ram subhag singh bihar ke baxur se chunaav jite the
 After this, there was no leader opposition even between 1980 and 89, but from 1989 to 2014 there was always a leader opposition
 loktantric sansthaaon se judi bahason main uski vikaas yatraaon kaa bhi dhyaan rakhaa janaa chahie or dekhnaa chahie ki 1952 se lekar aaj tak netaa vipaksh kii bhoomika kaise badal rahi he
 How the Leader of the Opposition, in addition to keeping an eye on the Government within the House, participates in many decisions of the Government outside the House, so that the public can be assured that the appointment of heads of constitutional bodies working independently of the Government in a transparent manner And the government has not appointed keeping in mind their interests
 ye sansthaaen hai kendriya soochna ayukta, kendriya satarkta ayog, rashtriya maanavadhikaar ayog, lokapal, sibiai or chunaav ayog
 One of the questions is that when the government is responsible to the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha, why should the leader of the Rajya Sabha, along with the Lok Sabha, also include the opposition in the provisions of these appointments
 ab aate hai 1977 or 1998 ke do kanoonon par jinaki charchaa is sandarbh main ho rahi he
 There is a difference between the two
 77 ke act main leaders of appjishan likhaa he or 98 ke act main dalon ke netaa or chif wheep kii manyata likhi he
 The Act of 98 does not contain the word Leader Opposition nor is the term of ten percent
 saal 1977 main janata party kii sarkaar ne pehali baar selary and alounsej of leaders of apozishan act paas kiya
 According to this, for the first time, the Leader of the Opposition gets statutory recognition, cabinet minister status, salary and other facilities
 isamen kaha gaya he ki sabase adhik sankhya vaale dal kaa netaa is pad ke yogya hoga
 Ten percent is not a condition
 parampara ke anusaar jab 1969 tak isi das pratishat yani korum ke baraabar sadsy na hone ke kaaran koi netaa vipaksh nahin hua to 1977 ke act main vipaksh se sarkaar main ai janata party ne das pratishat kii jagah sabase bada dal kyon kaha
 Our present guest Suyarprakash ji has written that the first speaker of Lok Sabha, GV Mavalankar, was of the view that democracy cannot develop properly unless there is a minimum number of parties
 maavlankar ke anusaar loksabhaa main sansadeey dal hone ke liye kisi dal kii apni vichaardhaara or kyrkram hone chahie, jo chunaav ke pehle ghoshit kiye jaaen or desh ke janamat ke sampark main rahane ke liye sadan ke baahar bhi uske sanghathan kaa dhaancha ho
 The party should not have less than the number of quorum required for the proceedings of the House
 aap jaanate hai ki sadan main korum sadsy sankhya kaa ek bata das hota he
 Mavalankar ji's own thoughts can be how many parties are there in a democracy
 parampara yaa kanoon kaa hissaa nahi
 Mavalankar ji laid the foundation of a tradition for recognition of a parliamentary party equal to a quorum by saying ten percent
 unke is kathan main netaa vipaksh shabd kaa istamaal nahin hua he
 The parliamentary party is made up of kanoon kaa hissaa tab bhi nahin bana
 i could not know whether between 1952 and 1969, anyone had questioned the recognition of the Leader of the Opposition
 vaise bhi suyarprakash ji ke is lekh main maavlankar ji sansadeey dal hone ke liye jo do sharten bataate hai unamem se ek congress puri karti he or ek nahin
 The Congress has an all-india structure and ideas
 is sambandh main likhane vaale kisi ne nahin likhaa he ki samvidhan sabha kaa kya rukh tha netaa vipaksh ko lekar
 In another article published in the Indian Express, Subhash Kashyap ji also writes that the speaker can decide any leader from the facility to the opposition leader, the seating area and the time of speaking
 magar spikar das pratishat kii shart nahin hataa saktin
 It is difficult for me to deduce from the article of constitution expert Kashyap whether he is saying that the speaker should give facilities as per the 1977 Act
 agar haa to spikar usee act main netaa vipaksh kii vaidhanik manyata ko kaise nazarandhaaz kar sakati hai
 If Kashyap ji is not saying this, is this issue only about the staff and salary
 subhash kashyap ne yah bhi likhaa he ki agar kai vipakshi partiyaan milakar das pratishat kii seemaa paar kar len yah public excekar ke saath frod hoga
 Kashyap ji seems correct as the term group or coalition is not mentioned in the 1977 and 1998 Act
 ve likhte hai ki sanvaidhanik sansthaaon ke pramukhon kii niyukti ke praavdhaan main tabdili kii ja sakati he
 But the BJP has been accused of messing with constitutional institutions during the Congress
 vah inaki pavitrataa ko behaal karegi
 Now how is the Congress claiming this? jawaharlal nehru ne jab netaa vipaksh kii manyata dene kii udaartaa nahin dikhaai to vah pradhanmantri modi se udaartaa kii apeksha kis aadhaar par rakhti he
 Leave Nehru
 kya indira gandhi ne 1971 main 352 siten jitkar 25 siten jeetne vaali sipiem or 22 siten jeetne vaale jansangh ke kisi netaa ko netaa vipaksh kii manyata di thi
 The fact was not given
 rajeev gandhi ko jab 404 siten mili thi, tab bijepi ko 2 siten ai thi
 At that time, TDP got the maximum 30 seats
 tab kyon rajeev gandhi ne tidipi netaa madhav reddy ko netaa vipaksh kii manyata nahin di thi
 The highest ideal of democracy demands that if only two members of the house are in opposition, then one of them should be recognized as the leader of the opposition
 jin logon ko narendra modi par shaq he, vah raashtrapati ke abhibhaashan ke vakt unke bhaashan ko phir se pard sakate hai, jisamen pradhanmantri sadan ko vishwaas dilaate hue kehete hai ki hamen sankhya ke bal par nahin chalanaa he
 We have to walk on the strength of collectivity
 ham us samuhikta ke bhav ko lekar aage badhanaa chaahate hai
 So whose examination is it, is this sentiment of the Prime Minister of the provisions of Lok Sabha or of tradition? ek police adhikari ne bataaya, karachi main gulistaan-e-johar ilaake ke safora chorangi main motorcycle par savaar aath bandookdhaariyon ne ek bas par andhadhundh golibari kar di

 In recent years, there has been an increase in communal violence in Pakistan, especially against minority Shia Muslims, who constitute about 20 percent of the country's Muslim population

 Police and Rangers are on the scene and have started a search operation

 Veteran athlete Milkha Singh on Tuesday retracted the statement of her father Salim Khan, who came to the rescue of Bollywood superstar Salman Khan in the 'sadbhavna Doot' case
 milkha ne kaha ki un par film banaakar film jagat ne un par koi upkaar nahin kiya he
 Criticism of IOA decision Salim Khan on Monday tried to defend his son by reacting to the criticism against the decision of Indian Olympic Association (IOA) to make Salman Khan the goodwill ambassador of India at Rio Olympics this year
 was
 olympic padak vijeta yogeshwar dutt, milkha singh sahit khel jagat ke kai diggajon ne ioe ke is faisle kii aalochana kii he
 In favor of his son Salman, Salim had said in a tweet on Monday, 'milkha ji, it is not Bollywood but Indian film industry, which is widely known around the world
 yah vahi film jagat he, jisane aapaki dhoomil ho rahi chhavi ko phir se logon ke saamne ujagar kiya' saleem khan, milkha singh ke jivan par bani film 'bhaag milkha bhaag' kaa zikr kar rahe the
 In response to Salim's statement, Milkha reiterated his two-day-old statement
 milkha singh kaa palatvaradiggaj athlete ne kaha ki ioe ko sochna chahie ki ambesder kii kya jarurat he? jo bhi team olympic main hissaa lene ja rahi he, uske sabhi sadsy ambesder hai
 These players are our ambassadors out of India's 120 crore population, so why do we need another ambassador? Milkha said that there is no point in appointing someone else to this post
 agar kisi ambesder kii jarurat he, to hamaare paas sachin tendulkar, pi tii usha, ajithpal singh, rajyavardhan singh rathore jaisi khel hastiyaan hai
 He said that it is a good thing that he made a film on my life, but i do not think that the film industry has done me any favor by doing so
 maine apni kahani ek rupee main di thi or yah koi choti cheez nahin he
 If he (the people of the film world) has a program, will he make a player the president or the ambassador? Meanwhile, Salman has been supported by celebrities like BJP MP and actress Kiran Kher and filmmaker Sooraj Barjatya
 kiran ne yahaan 'dada sahib phalke excilence' puraskaar samaaroh main kaha ki yah kaaphi acha faisla he
 i am very proud of Salman Khan, whatever people are saying that only one player should be made a goodwill ambassador, i would like to stay away from them

 loksabhaa chunaav 2019(lok Sabha Election 2019) kaa maidan sajane laga he or ab partiyaan apni-apni siyaasi ganit kaa sameekaran thik karne main jute gai hai
 Just before the Lok Sabha elections, while the opposition is united in the grand alliance exercises at the national level, the NDA is getting a setback
 bihar main endie ke pramukh ghatak dalon main se ek yani upendra kushvaha (upendra Kushwaha)kii party ralospa (RLSP) ne jhatka de diya he or ab rajd ke saath mahagathbandhan kaa hissaa banane ko taiyaar he
 At the same time, Ramvilas Paswan, who is famous in the political corridors as an electoral meteorologist, has also started putting political gun-arithmetic and if sources are to be believed, LJP can also shock the BJP
 yahi vajah he ki unki party ne bhi ab endie main bijepi se pressure politics karnaa shuru kar diya he
 In fact, after Upendra Kushwaha broke away from the NDA, LJP has also shown its rebellious tone
 sutron kii maane to ramvilas paswan ke bete or saasand chiraag paswan ne bijepi ko spasht taur par kisaanon or garibon ke liye kuch karne ko lekar ultimatum diya he or muddon kii raajnneetik karne ko kaha he
 Now Paswan's party's new demand from BJP - give us seats in Jharkhand and UP as well, there is our votebank if it is to be said that after Upendra Kushwaha's party RLSP (RLSP) takes over from NDA, signs of another split in NDA Are visible, it will not be wrong at all
 kyonki chiraag paswan ne khud kaha he ki unhone mangalvaar ko jo twit kiya he, vah kaaphi soch samajhakar kiya he
 In fact, Chirag Paswan, Lok Janshakti Party MP and son of Ram Vilas Paswan, with respect to the honorable seats, warned the BJP that now the NDA alliance is going through a delicate turn after TDP and RLSP departed from NDA
 aise samay main bhartiya janata party gathbandhan main filhal bache hue saathiyon kii chintaaon ko samay rahete sammaan purvak tareeqe se dur kare
 Chirag Paswan warned the BJP, Upendra Kushwaha said - We have come out of the NDA, AAP too
 Jai Hirag Paswan made it clear in another tweet that seat sharing is the reason for the tussle between BJP and his party in the NDA
 kyonki chiraag paswan ne twit main kaha ki siton ko lekar abhi tak koi thos baatcheet nahin hui he
 He tweeted - i have met the leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party many times regarding the seats of the coalition, but so far nothing concrete has been done
 is vishay par samay rahete baat nahin bani to isse nuqasaan bhi ho saktaa he
 Apart from this, the pull in Bihar NDA can also be understood that Ram Vilas Paswan's party Lok Janshakti Party has demanded from BJP that they be given seats in Jharkhand and UP
 party ke pramukh ramvilas paswan ke bhai pashupati paras ne kaha 'ham log vahi maang rahe he jin par hamaara adhikaar he
 We are honest partners of NDA
 ham utani hi siten maang rahe hai, jitani par saal 2014 main chunaav lade the
 We need seats in Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh, because our vote bank is also in these states
 samay niklaa ja rahaa he
 We are keen that Amit Shah should decide on this by 31 December
 ham chaahate hai ki bhaajapa gathbandhan kii pavitrataa banaae rakhe
 However, the RLSP chief Upendra Kushwaha also wants the LJP to split from the NDA and be part of the grand alliance with them
 haalanki, aisi khabar he ki kushvaha aaj dilli main mahagathbandhan main shaamil hone ke faisle kaa elaan kar sakate hai
 It is being told that in the presence of RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav, Jeetan Ram Manjhi of Hindustani Awam Morcha and a Congress representative, he can announce his participation in the Kushwaha Grand Alliance by holding a press conference
 vipakshi netaa sharad yadav bhi kaarykram main shaamil ho sakate hai
 On Wednesday, RLSP chief Upendra Kushwaha advised LJP to break away from NDA
 rashtriya lok samta party ke adhyaksh upendra kushvaha ne chiraag paswan ko salaah dete hue kaha he, 'lok janashakti party ko jald se jald endie gathbandhan se alag ho janaa chahie
 These people ruin small parties
 ham to baahar aa gaye
 The good thing is that LJP also understands this

 So far the intruders have been identified, further we will stop the infiltration
 -pradhanmantri modi ne raily main kaha ki raashtra kii suraksha ke liye hamane sankalp liya he, congress or unke saathi is baar deshvirohi soch ke saath aage badha rahe hai
 The Congress is saying that it will not remove JK from Article 370, the Congress's fraud and the language of Pakistan are the same
 congress bhi algaavvaadiyon se baat karne kii baat kar rahi he or pakistan bhi yahi chahta he
 -the Prime Minister said that Congress is talking about the removal of the law of treason and is talking about humanity
 lekin isi congress ne bala sahib se voting kaa adhikaar chin liya tha, use pehle aaina dekhnaa chahie
 -PM Modi also targeted NCP chief Sharad Pawar here
 unhone kaha ki congress or ensipi aaj unke saath hai jo jammu-kashmir main alag se pradhanmantri chaahate hai, congress se to koi ummid nahin kii ja sakati he lekin 'sharad raav' aap se aisi ummid nahin thi

 To stay updated with the latest news of the general election, subscribe to Aaj Tak's election special newsletter biechayu main teachers kii bhartee ke liye ujisi kii nai aarakshan vyavastha lagu hui to anusuchit jati (SC) kii siten 50 fisadi, anusuchit janajati (ST) kii siten 80 fisadi or obisi kii siten 30 fisadi tak ghat jaaengi
 It is not anybody else but Banaras Hindu University (BHU) itself
 indian express ke anusaar, vishvavidhyalay prashasan ne jo aankade jari kiye hai unke mutabik 12 may, 2017 tak faikalti ke kul 1,930 pad the
 If the old reservation system were in place, out of this 289 seats would be for scs, 143 for sts and 310 for obcs
 lekin ujisi ke nae aarakshan formule ke mutabik uniwarsity main essi ke liye 119 siten, asti ke liye 29 siten or obisi ke liye mahaj 220 siten arakshit hongi
 What is wrong? In the old reservation system, the entire university was considered a unit, but according to the new system, now any one department will be seen as a separate unit
 kisi vibhaag ko ek unit maanakar aarakshan dene kaa matlab yah he ki jin vibhaagon main ek yaa do post khaali he, unamem SC / ST ko aarakshan nahin mil paaegaa
 Most of such posts are of professor
 jaankaron ke mutabik nae formule main jin vibhaag main kisi cader main do yaa usase adhik lekin 15 se kam post khaali hai vahaan bhi keval ek essi ko serial number 7 or keval ek asti ko serial number 14 par aarakshan mil paaegaa
 In this way, if less than 6 posts of Associate Professor are vacant in any department, SC / ST will not get any reservation in them
 inamen aarakshan kaa laabh roteshan ke aadhaar par milegaa, jisamen varshon lag jaaenge
 The Central Government has cited the same estimate of the university in the Special Leave Petition (SLP) filed in the Supreme Court last month
 elahabaad hoicourt ke aadesh ke mutabik ujisi kaa nayaa formula lagu kiya janaa he
 But in the petition against this order, the government has stated in the Supreme Court that, 'this will reduce the seats of reserved class considerably and in many departments will be completely cleaned, leaving no representation of SC / ST community in them

 Sonia Gandhi has called a meeting of opposition leaders to counter the government's proposal to extend the budget session
 jaankaree ke anusaar ye baithak mangalvaar subah 9:30 baje bulaai he
 In this meeting, the opposition will show solidarity against the government's proposal to extend the session
 mana ja rahaa he sonia gandhi kii vipakshi ekajutata dikhaane ke peeche ranneeti yah he ki sarkaar ko satr badhaane se rokna he
 The cons of the opposition is that the government is getting the bills without the scrutiny of the bills without going to its details
 vipaksh kaa kahana he ki bilon ko naa to standing cameti yaa joint cameti main bheja ja rahaa he
 Rather, the bills are being passed by bringing them directly in the Parliament
 jo ki kisi bhi lihaaj se thik nahin he
 The opposition alleges that the government wants to pass the bills in a hurry
 16 bill rajyasabha main or 10 bill loksabhaa main paas hone ke liye pending hai
 On the other hand, the government is trying to get these bills passed by extending the session
 magar vipaksh is baat ke liye bilkul raji nahin he
 The opposition does not want the session to be extended
 jabaki sarkaar 10 din tak house badhanaa chaahati he
 The government believes that it is the government's jurisdiction to run the session for how many days and for how long it is because the government has to see that the legislative functions they have, the bills that are passed
 spikar kii adhyakshata main hui bijness adwijuri cameti main bhi sarkaar ne vipaksh ke saamne prastaav rakhaa ki satr ko badhaayaa jaae taaki bache hue bilon ko paas karavaaya ja sake
 However, the opposition was not ready for this
 vipaksh ne sarkaar ke is prastaav kaa virodh kiya kaha ki satr badhaane ke khilaaf he
 The government will soon take a decision about extending the session in a day or two, but before that, Sonia Gandhi has called a meeting of opposition parties and plans to oppose the government's proposal by forming a common strategy

 com / kgcr85ufwp bhartiya janata party (BJP) ne haryana ko chhod maharashtra vidhansabha chunaav main puri takat jhonk di he
 Many national leaders from Delhi have been deployed on the Maharashtra front for election management
 iske peeche kai vajahen bataai ja rahi hai
 Actually, the BJP is finding the road easier in Haryana, but there are some difficulties in Maharashtra
 maharashtra main bhaajapa kii ladaai congress-rakanpa gathbandhan se to he hi, andarkhaane shivasena se bhi he
 a BJP leader said, "like every part of the country, the opposition in Maharashtra is not in a position to face the BJP
 sach to yah he ki maharashtra main hamaari ladaai vipaksh se kam, shivasena se zyada he
 "sources say that if Shiv Sena is successful in getting more seats than last time, it will come to bargain over its stake in the government
 isse ashankit bhaajapa kii koshish he ki vah akele purna bahumat ke aankade tak pahunche
 This is the reason why the party has given full force in Maharashtra
 bhaajapa ke sheersh netritv ke nirdesh par goa ke mukhyamantri pramod saavant or uttar pradesh ke upmukhyamantri keshav prasad maurya lagaataar maharashtra main date hue hai
 Maurya is also the co-incharge of Maharashtra assembly elections
 sakriyata kaa alam yah he ki maharashtra main based 40 lakh se zyada hindi bhashi, uttar-bharatiyon kaa vot paane ke liye uttar pradesh or bihar jaise rajyon ke jilastareey netaaon tak ko yahaan jansampark abhiyaan main lagaaya gaya he
 Talking about the top leaders, two national general secretaries of BJP - Bhupendra Yadav and Saroj Pandey - have camped here for more than a month
 bhupendra yadav maharashtra main vidhansabha chunaav prabharee hai to saroj pandeya rajya prabharee hai
 Both leaders are so busy with the election management of the state that they are unable to make time to come to Delhi even during this time
 bhupendra yadav ko party amuman sankat vaale rajyon main lagaati he
 In such a situation, the importance of their deployment in Maharashtra can be understood
 vahiin kendriya mantriyon kii baat karen to party ke varisht netaa nitin gadakari, piyush goyal or smriti irani bhi maharashtra main abhiyaan ko dhar de rahe hai
 There are many rallies a day from the level of Gadkari and Irani
 khaas baat yah he ki bhaajapa ne maharashtra chunaav main media management ke liye apane donon sheersh padaadhikariyon ko laga rakhaa he
 It has national media in-charge Anil Baluni and co-incharge and Sanjay Mayukh, MLC of Bihar
 jabaki haryana main media management kaa kaam rashtriya pravaktaa sudesh verma hi dekh rahe hai
 Talking about Haryana, Union Minister Narendra Singh Tomar is looking at election management as the Assembly election incharge
 yahaan party ne sirf ek rashtriya mahasachiv dow
 Anil Jain is on the front
 jain hi rajya ke prabharee bhi hai
 Organization General Secretary b
 el
 Santosh is also giving the mantra to the leaders to reach Haryana in between
 haryana main modi-shah or rajnath singh kii tabadatod reliyaan ho rahi hai, magar maharashtra kii tarah yahaan rashtriya netaaon kaa jamaavada kam he
 Sources reveal that seeing the road in Haryana, the BJP has relied more on the local leaders than the national leaders
 sutara bataate hai ki haryana kii tulana main maharashtra par bhaajapa ke khaas focus ke peeche kai vajahen hai
 One is only 90 seats in Haryana, while Maharashtra has 288 assembly seats
 duusari baat ki haryana ke bajaae maharashtra main zyada chunautiyaan hai
 The opposition in Maharashtra is strong
 bhaajapa ko yahaan dohari chunautiyon se jujhna pad rahaa he
 On the one hand, it has to fight the congress-ncp alliance, on the other hand it has been running on various issues from seat sharing till now with its alliance partner Shiv Sena
 2014 ke vidhansabha chunaav main gathbandhan tuutane par sabhi 288 vidhansabha siton par alag-alag ladane par bhaajapa ko 122 siten milin thim, vahiin shivasena ko sirf 63 hasil huin thim jabaki congress or rakanpa ko kramash: 42 or 41 siten milin thim
 The BJP then had to form the government with the support of the Shiv Sena due to less than 20 seats with an absolute majority
 is baar 2019 ke vidhansabha chunaav main bhaajapa gathbandhan ke kaaran sirf 150 siton par khud lard rahi he, vahiin 14 siton par uske hi simbel par anya sahyogi dal lard rahe hai
 While Shiv Sena is contesting 124 seats
 aise main bhaajapa ko lagata he ki is baar kam siton par chunaav ladane ke kaaran agar pichhali baar se kam siten ain or shivasena kii siten badhin to bhaajapa ke liye mushkilen hongeech piemasi bank ghotaale ne bhaajapa ke liye ek nai mushkil khadi kar di he
 The problem of farmers is already troubling the party
 sutron kaa kahana he ki yahi vajah he ki bhaajapa ne maharashtra ke vidhansabha chunaav ke liye puri takat jhonk di he
