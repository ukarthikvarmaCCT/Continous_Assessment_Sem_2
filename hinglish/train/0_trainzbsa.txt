 Something that changed the whole world
 kisi ko yah bataanaa anyaay he ki shiksha hi har uljhan ko sulajhane kii chaabi he, jabaki aap baar baar us chaabi kaa taala badal dete hai
 So wake up, wake up !! Raise your voice tab tak jab tak aap har bachche ke hisse ke aasmaan main hue chhed ko bhar nahin dete

 But all these parties are not natural allies of BJP
 na hi aisa he ki vipakshi dal (congress) ke khilaaf ye dal ekajute hai
 All these parties can go to any camp according to their ideology and needs

 Mulayam Singh has not campaigned even once in Azamgarh after the father-son quarrel twist, while Akhilesh Yadav has held back to back public meetings in Azamgarh
 vahiin dimple yadav bhi yahaan teen baar aakar prachaar kar chuki hai

 azamgarh mau se sata hua zila he or ansaari bandhuon kaa prabhaav kuch had tak azamgarh main bhi he
 In such a situation, will Akhilesh Yadav's relationship with Mukhtar Ansari really dent the SP? On the other, the Ulema Council, formed after the Batla House encounter, has given its support to the BSP
 ulema council ke netaa or basapa ke nasimuddin siddiki manch saajha kar chuke hai
 In such a situation, Muslim voters are also expected to stick

 rahul ne party main apane sipahasalaron or prabhariyon ko aagaah kiya he ki ye sanghathan he jo chunaav ladega, nijee taur par ummidavaar nahin
 PL Punia, Congress in-charge for Chhattisgarh told India Today, Rahul ji has asked us to be ready and strengthen the organization in such a way that the candidates, not the candidates, contested the elections
 isse party main mandalibaaji or gutbaji kaa khaatmaa hoga
 It has been said that there are many strong groups in the Congress who keep fighting amongst themselves, due to which the party has suffered a lot in the elections in the past
 congress kaa adhyaksh banane ke baadaraahul gandhi party main niyukt kiye gaye mahasachivon or prabhariyon ko saaf nirdesh die hai ki sanghathan ko majboot bananaa praathamikta main sabase upar he
 Amethi MP Rahul Gandhi has also asked the general secretaries and in-charge of all state units to prepare a report on the state of the Congress in every constituency

 According to the instructions of the Congress President, we have started preparations for the 2019 elections
 or ab ye sanghathan he jo aglaa chunaav ladega

 Mayawati said in a statement that the true benefit of the change of power is not available to the general public because there has been no reduction in crime in the state, but the incidents of casteist violence and political enmity have taken a more formidable shape
 unhone kaha ki bhaajapa kaa aadhaar vot maane jane vaale vyapaaree bhi din-dahaade lut va hatyaon se dahal gaye hai
 The events of Saharanpur and Mathura have blown the claims of the Yogi government
 iske baavjood sarkaar vidhansabha main kahati he ki apradhi jis bhashaa main samajhenge, usee bhashaa main samajhaayenge

 ) There has been an uproar after differences between the central government and the BJP over beef eating (beef)
 ek taraf kiran rigiju ke taaja bayaan ko aade haathon liya ja rahaa he, vahiin mukhtaar abbaas nakvi ke vivaadit bayaan se bhi bijepi kinaaraa karti najar aa rahi he
 BJP leader Yogi Adityanath said that beef is an issue related to the faith of the majority of the country
 loktantr main janabhaavana sarvopari he or iskaa sammaan hona chahie
 We are in favor of a ban on import and export of beef
 jab unase poocha gaya ki kya mantriyon ko is bare main bayaan dene se bachanaa chahie to unhone kaha, 'mantri ho chaahe santari ho, janabhaawanaaon ke viruddh aacharan kisi ko nahin karnaa chahie
 'naqvi may not have meant that: Shahnawaz: BJP leader Shahnawaz Hussain Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi's statement was seen in which he had told beef eaters to go to Copakistan
 shahanvaj ne kaha, 'main saudi gaya hua tha or maine nahin dekha ki nakvi ji ne kya kaha he
 But i think his point was misinterpreted
 samvidhan ke mutabik, yah buniyadi adhikaar he ki agar koi bharat main janma he to use desh ke baahar nahin nikaala ja saktaa
 'tyagi ki pinch,' Now send Rijiju to Pakistan 'this ruckus started when Union Minister of State for Home Kiren Rijiju supported eating beef and criticized the statement of his senior leader and Union Minister of State Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi on the issue 
 alpsankhyak maamalon ke rajyamantri nakvi ne kaha tha ki bif khaane waalon kopakistan chale janaa chahie
 This statement was described by Kiran Rijiju as 'distasteful' and told that he himself eats beef
 bijepi ke is andruni bavaal par ab vipaksh bhi tanj kasne se nahin chook rahaa
 JDU leader KC Tyagi said, 'now the country's Minister of State for Home should send to Pakistan and get his visa ready
 ' ensipi netaa tarik anwar ne kaha ki aisa lagata he ki sarkaar main kisi kaa control nahin he
 Whose mind speaks, and later he has to apologize
 main khaataa hum bif, koun rokegaa: rigijuisase pehle bijepi netaa or kendriya grih rajya mantri rigiju ne kaha, 'mambifakhata hum
 i am from Arunachal Pradesh
 kya koi mujhe roak saktaa he? hamen kisi ke rojaanaa ke kaamon se aahat nahin hona chahie
 He said this in Aizawl on Tuesday
 unhone kaha, 'yah ek loktantric desh he
 But many times statements are made which are not interesting
 'angreji akhbaar 'da indian express' kii khabar ke mutabik, unhone kaha, 'agar koi mizo isai kahata he ki yah jisas kii dharti he to punjab or haryana main kisi ko dikkat kyon hoti he? hamen har jagah ke logon kii bhaawanaaon kaa aadar karnaa hoga
 He said that Maharashtra is a Hindu majority state, Gujarat is also, Madhya Pradesh is also, if they make laws which are beneficial for Hindu society, then they should be allowed to do so
 lekin hamaari jagah par jahaan ham bahusankhyak hai, hamaari manyataon ke liye hitkaari kanoon hi banane chahie
 He said, 'we have no problem with their way of life, they should not be in our way
 agar koi aisa bayaan detaa he jo aapaki manyataon par thopa hua-sa lage to yah acha nahin he

 The question was, 'if you won with Lalu ji and got good numbers (seats), how would you be able to give good development with coalition government?'

 ' During the voting of the last phase of the election, Congress President Rahul Gandhi attacked PM Modi's visit to Kedarnath and Badrinath and called it a drama

 The Supreme Court's decision has come in the matter of demolishing the Carmichael Library building near the Kashi Vishwanath Temple in Varanasi
 kirayedaro ko badi raahat dete hue supreme court ne yathasthiti banaae rakhane kaa aadesh diya he
 Also, the court has sought a response from the Uttar Pradesh government till Monday
 bataa den, elahabaad hoicourt ne kaashi vishwanath mandir ke paas bane karmical librari bhawan ko giraane ke liye kaha tha
 This decision was challenged in the Supreme Court
 yachikakarta ne apane yachika main kaha ki banaras main kaashi vishwanath mandir ke navinikaran ke liye agar unka karmical librari bhawan giraaya jaae to unhen yaa to sarkaar muaavja de yaa phir kahi or dukaan diya jaae
 There was a plan to remove this library building for expansion of Srikashi Vishwanath Temple
 shrikashi vishwanath vikaas parishad ne ise khaali karne kaa notice diya tha
 After this notice, the library administration approached the Supreme Court
 kaashi coridor ko nayaa or bhavy aakaar dene ke liye sadak ke donon ore vistarikaran kaa kaam ho rahaa he
 The library building was coming in this way
 karmical librari banaras kii pehali saarvajanik librari maani jaati he
 It has a collection of rare books and texts
 kaha jaataa he ki is librari main munshi premchand, bhaaratendu harishchandra, acharya ramchandra shukla, hajaari prasad dvivedi jaise prakand vidwaanon kaa jamaavada lagata tha
 Presently this library has more than one lakh books
 itanagar se lagbhag 100 kimi dur, ek durgam pahari raste par arunachal pradesh ke upree hisse main ek apper subansiri jila he
 Here snow-capped mountains surround the entire district as a beautiful example
 is jile main hajaaron parivaar rahete hai, jinamein kai adivasee parivaar bhi shaamil hai
 Ruhi Danish Ashraf first came to this district in 2016
 usee dauraan unke pati danish ashraf ek IAS adhikari ke taur par yahaan tainaat hue the
 When she went out for a walk in the area, she noticed that there were already three schools in the district but there was less staff
 isse yahaan padhane vaale bacchon ke rigelt par asar pad rahaa tha
 According to a report published in Your story, Roohi, after looking at the schools here, thought that he should now use engineering education properly
 ruhi kahati hai ki maine tabhi un bacchon ko padhaane kii sochi
 Ruhi from Your story said that he decided to teach Physics in 12th in Government Higher Secondary School located at Daporijo
 Daporijo yahaan kaa jila mukhyalay he jahaan paanch saal se Physics kaa teacher na hone se bacchon ko kaaphi mushkil ho rahi thi
 Ruhi, who is an electronic engineer, Ruhi studying electronic engineering, started teaching Physics to children without any fees
 iskaa asar yah hua ki march 2019 main fijics main 80 fisad chaatr paas ho gaye
 At the same school, only 21 percent passed in Physics in this school
 Digital India main prakashit demographic report ke mutabik bhi Upper Subansiri sakshartaa main 64 fisadi neeche he
 The main reason behind this is lack of resources and especially teaching staff in the schools here
 ruhi aise vakt main in chaatro kii jimmedaari lekar saamne ain
 At first, she was nervous when she started teaching, she was nervous at first
 unhen padhaane kaa bhi koi anubhav nahin tha
 Not only this, he was also hesitant to speak on stage
 yaheen se maine apane sabhi daron par jeet hasil karne kii thaanee or bacchon ko kisi bhi tarah padhaane kii sochi
 The children here were very weak in this subject due to not being a Physics teacher for a long time, for this, the children tried on their own behalf, along with Ruhi also taught children by taking extra classes
 dilli aakar karti thim video downalodin bacchon main hameshaa kuch na kuch nayaa concept seekhney kii lalak rahati thi
 For this, Ruhi went ahead and adopted the new method of teaching on children
 ab vah bacchon ko projector se padhaane lageen, saath hi vah padhai ke tareeke ko halkaa karne ke liye fun element bhi jod diya
 For example, she used to explain by showing superhero movies to explain gravitation and momentum
 ruhi ke liye yah kaaphi aasaan nahin tha
 She explains that there used to be a network problem in the hilly area
 iske liye vah apane hometown dilli aati thim or yahaan video downlod karke bacchon ko dikhaati thim
 How it happened Initially, her husband Danish Ashraf was posted as Deputy Commissioner in Upper Subansiri district in 2016
 unhone bataaya ki kuch chaatro ne unase apane skool main fijics teacher kii maang kii thi
 He says that when children come to him for the first time, it came to my mind that i will ask Ruhi if she will be ready to teach
 maine jaise hi ruhi se poocha vah turant taiyaar ho gai

 The important meeting of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of India (marxist) began in Kolkata on Friday
 teen din tak chalane vaali is baithak main party 2019 loksabhaa chunaav se pehle apni bhavi ranneeti par faisla legi
 The meeting was attended by party general secretary Sitaram Yechury, Politburo member Prakash Karat, Kerala CM P
P
 vijayan or tripura ke siem maanik sarkaar bhi hissaa le rahe hai
 Let us know that the CPM meeting is going to be held in Hyderabad in April this year
 kolkata main ho rahi party central cameti kii baithak main raajnneetik prastaav ke draft ko antim rup diya jayega
 It will be released after the completion of the meeting
 aisa isliye kiya jayega ki hyderabad main ise manjuur kiye jane se pehle is par saarvajanik str par or party main andruni taur par vyapak mantranaa kii ja sake
 However, there are clear differences in the draft of the political proposal in the party
 sipiem kii top leadership is baat par to ekamat he ki unka mukhya uddeshy centre mensattarudh bijepiur anya sampradayik takaton ko haraana he
 But the top leader of the party is not Ekrai, on which paths to achieve this goal
 mote taur par party raajnneetik prastaavon ke do draft ko lekar banty najar aa rahi he
 One has the support of the lobby with party general secretary Sitaram Yechury

 The party's Bengal leaders are believed to be behind Yechury, considered more pragmatic
 vahiin hardliner maane jane vaale karaat ko party kii kerala leadership kaa samarthan hasil mana jaataa he
 The CPM, in its Congress held in Visakhapatnam in 2015, had decided that the party would keep an equal distance from both the BJP and the Congress
 lekin ab dekhnaa he ki party centre se bijepi ko baahar karne ke liye nae 'vaikalpik' left democratic front ke hisse ke taur par anyasecular partyonse sahyog yaa kisi tarah kii sahmati banane ke sawaal par kya 'ranneetik line' leti he

 aar pillai jaise hardliner kisi bhi 'sahmati yaa gathbandhan' ke sakht khilaaf hai vahiin yechuri samarthit draft jamini sthitiyon ko dekhte hue is vichaar ko khaarij nahin karata
 However, whatever the CPM ultimately decides will have a direct impact on the party's future relationship with the Congress
 ye tay he ki yechuri ke vaikalpik plan kaa congress ahm hissaa he
 In the 2016 West Bengal assembly elections, the CPM did not form a formal alliance with the Congress, but it did form a strategic consensus
 beete disambar main sipiem paulitabeuro kii baithak main party ke donon pakshon ne sabhi matbhed sulajhane par sahmati jataai thi jisase ki party kii central cameti ke saamne saajha draft pesh kiya ja sake

 kabhi jis bihar se mistar natvarlaal nikle the
 This father of all Lallantop who came out of the present Bihar has even faded the story of Natwarlal
 kya khel khelaa isane
 Yes yes baat bihar ke us college ke principal baccha raay kii he jo apane yahaan padhane vaale lallanon ko top karaata tha
 Now the new revelation that has been revealed is that Kibcha Rai's daughter topped the science in Bihar this year without sitting in the examination of the twelfth
 or jis saurabh shreshth ko ab tak science kaa topper mana ja rahaa tha wo to bechaara second topper niklaa
 This is called the father of Lallantop
 bihar kii puri shiksha pranali kaa baap!vaaki ye baap niklaa
 Not just of her dear daughter
 ghotaalon kaa baap
 Father of forgery
 farjivade kaa baap
 Father of the entire education system of Bihar
 dasvin or barahavin ke imtehaan kaa baap or bihar ke saare lallantop kaa baap
 Have you ever heard that someone should top a test and hide the ustopper from the past? These are eye-opening and mind-boggling documents
 wo bhi bihar police ke
 Yes yes ye exiaar kii copy he
 And this name is written at the top of this copy
 shalini raay
 Roll Number 33014 / 10106
 inter science main pratham sthaan
 That is, science topper
 aise banaaya beti ko topraye exiaar bihar kii shiksha vyavastha par ek jhannatedaar tamaacha he
 This FIR is also a proof of how people like Bacha Rai remain the father of Bihar Education Board
 kamaal he is baap kaa
 Two years ago, the daughter was topped in Bihar in the examination of the tenth and now made the daughter topper number one in the twelfth as well
 garv hota agar ye bacchee shalini apane dam par top karti
 The whole of Bihar would take care of this father along with his daughter
 magar baap is kadar kamaal niklaa ki naa sirf beti kii copy kaa number badalawa diya balki kisi ko ye bhanak tak nahin lagane di ki uski beti ne science main top kiya he
 Rather, instead of making this other Lallan a science topper, he hid his daughter's result
 exiaar main saaf-saaf likhaa he ki baccha raay kii beti shalini raay kaa copy number faad diya gaya or uski jagah doosraa number chipka diya gaya
 Police started raids, after this recent revelation, it is evident that this picture of two years old has also suddenly become very important
 do saal pehle kii ye tabaki tasviir he jab shalini raay ne dasvin main top kiya tha
 Then the whole Bihar really thought that if there is a father, then a child is like Rai and if a daughter is like Shalini
 par ab do saal baad jaakar ye maaloom padaa ki ye to sachmuch lallantop kaa baap he
 But the father is absconding at the moment
 ab jaahir he jab baap hi faraar he to bachche kahaan milenge
 They also disappeared
 udhar police ne jaise hi exiaar darj kar chhapemari kaa silsilaa shuru kiya to imtehaan or uske nateezon ke jimmedaar bihar shiksha board ke adhyaksh ne bhi aanan-fanan main istipha de diya
 Ruby gave the board time till June 11, till today, what the boil of Lalntop was in Bihar
 nitish kumaar ne vaade ke mutabik ghotaale kii jaanch ke liye jaise hi police kii special investegative team banaai to saare lallantop gaayab ho gaye
 Can't find it now esaiti kii exiaar main philhal chaar chaatro kogalat tareeke se top karne ke liye namajadakiya gaya he
 In addition to Shalini Rai, Saurabh, Rahul Kumar and Ruby Rai are named
 exiaar main science kii topper shalini ke baad topper number do yani saurabh ke bare main kaha gaya he ki uski yogyata or uski copy main jameen-aasmaan kaa fark tha
 Saurabh topped because either his copy was changed or there was some other disturbance
 science ke topper teen rahul kumaar ke bare main bhi yahi kaha gaya he ki yogyata tisare darje kii bhi nahin lekin naam topper list main tha
 Ruby Roy, the art topper, could not muster the courage to come before the experts for fear of opening the polls
 exiaar main kaha gaya he ki rubi kaa 11 june tak intjaar kiya jayega
 If she comes to give the test in front of the committee of Bihra examination board on June 11, then otherwise the police will take action
 college ko phayda pahunchane ke liye kiya gaya isaereiaar main likhaa he ki vishundev raay college jahaan se science ke pehle teen topper yani shalini, saurabh or rahul or arts kii topper rubi raay nikali hai us college kii kaapiyon kaa moolyankan bhabhua or aara jile main hona tha
 Vishun Rai College falls in Vaishali district and all the college examination centers in this district were evaluated at these two places
 par akelaa vishuneray college aisa tha jisaki kapiyaan patna ke rajendra balak hai skool main janchi gayi
 According to the FIR, this was done to benefit Vishunpay College
 exiaar darj karne ke saath hi esaiti kii team lagaataar alag-alag jagahon par chaape maar rahi he
 The team also reached Vishun Rai College
 saath hi patna ke us skool par bhi chapa maaraa jahaan is college kii kapiyaan janchi gai thim
 The school principal was arrested after the raid
 iske alaava skool ke do clerk bhi giraftaar kiye gaye he
 While a peon has been detained
 baccha raay ke naam ek anokhaa recordbarahavin ke imtehaan ke nattejey tak ko bech daalane vaale koi ikkaa-dukka log nahin he
 a whole gang is behind it
 par is giroh ke har shaks ko agar koi benakaab kar saktaa he to wo he sabase zyada lalalntop dene vaale college kaa principal yani baccha raay
 Just believe that if this one person spewed the truth or the truth was extracted from it, then believe the whole game of becoming the top of Lallan of Bihar will become common
 inkaa naam he baccha raay
 And the identity is to top the rings
 record par shaayad kabhi ye record nahin aayaa magar baccha raay ke naam ek anokhaa record he
 He became the principal of the same Vishunarai Intermediate College at the age when the children usually go to enroll in the college, which has become a topper factory today
 19 saal kii umr main ban gaya prisimplebachha raay ne 1994 main dasvin kaa imtehaan paas kiya tha
 But after this, it took him another four years to pass the examination of XII
 darasal yebarahavin main do baar felho gaye
 Then for the third time in 1998, he gave examination from his father's same Vishunarai college and passed from the first division
 barahavin kaa imtehaan paas karne ke agle hi saal yani 1999 main ye achaanak usee college ke principal ban gaye
 At that time, he was only 19 years old
 phir principal banane ke baad inhone aisa jaadu dikhaaya ki ye skool topper nikaalane kii khan ban gaya
 Admission here meant that if not the topper, then it is guaranteed to pass with the Distinction number or else from the First Division
 2007 main pehali baar uchhla tha namis college main gadabadi kaa maamla sabase pehle 2007 main saamne aayaa tha
 Then suddenly the result of the students here started showing mirror to the whole of Bihar
 uske baad se to college ne kabhi peeche mud kar hi nahin dekha
 Till two years ago, the college's method of making toppers was quite simple
 tab imtehaan ke dauraan hi pariksha kendron par chaatro ko nakal kara kar top karaayaa jaataa tha
 For this, either the answers were prepared in advance or a scholar would write the answers to the students
 bahut se chaatro ko to pariksha centre bhi jane kii jarurat nahin padati thi
 In his place, another scholar could write a copy in his name
 shiksha mafia se argedy kaa netaa takaphir do saal pehle jab prashasan ne nakal par nakel lagane kii muhim shuru kii to baccha raay ne bhi apana tarika badal liya
 By then, he had also become the leader of the RJD from the education mafia
 uski pahunch ab bihar pariksha board tak thi
 So now after Imtehan, he has also become an expert in the game of changing copies
 jaahir he baccha raay is puure ghotaale kaa iklauta jimmedaar to nahin ho saktaa
 There are people behind it too
 jo sarkaar se lekar pariksha board tak main hai
 It is just to see how long the Nitish government's hand reaches them

 Rahul also took photographs with Rajamma's relatives and some party workers
 in logon ko rahul se milane ke liye badi der tak intjaar karnaa padaa
 When Rahul Gandhi was born on 19 June 1970 at Holy Family Hospital in Delhi, then Rajamma took care of Rahul as a trainee nurse there
 jab rajmma ne bataaya ki unke saamne rahul kaa janm hua or navjaat rahul ko unhone hi apane haathon main uthaaya tha tab muskaraate hue rahul unki baat dhyaan se sunate rahe
 Before leaving, Rajamma presented Rahul with jackfruit chips and sweets which he had made by himself
 rahul ne rajmma se dobaaraa milane kaa vaada kiya
 Thrilled Rajamma later said that she was very happy to meet Rahul after so many years
 unhone kaha, 'main sachmuch bahut khush or romanchit hum
 i was one of those who raised the newborn Rahul in his hands
 jab main unase mili tab un dinon kii yaaden taaja ho gayi
 'rajamma said,' i thought i should offer them something
 isliye maine apane haath se banaae chips or mithaiyaan unhen bhent kin
 During the Lok Sabha election campaign, when controversy was raised about Rahul's citizenship, Rajamma had said that she was also among those who were on duty at Holy Family Hospital during the birth of Congress President Rahul on June 19, 1970
 unhone yah bhi kaha tha ki vah un logon main se hai jinhone navjaat rahul ko apane haathon main uthaaya tha
 Rajamma had said, 'I am very fortunate as i was one of those people who took the newborn Rahul into their own hands
 vah bahut hi pyaare the
 i am a witness to his birth
 main romanchit thi
 We were all thrilled to see the grandson of the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi
 ' unhone bataaya tha ki rahul kii maa sonia gandhi ko prasav ke liye aspataal ke prasuti kaksh main le jaaya gaya or unke pita rajeev gandhi or chachaa sanjay gandhi prasuti kaksh ke baahar intjaar kar rahe the
 Rajamma, who took a nursing course from Holy Family Hospital, later joined the army as a nurse

 chunaav ayog ne guuruuvaar ko himachal pradesh main vidhansabha chunaav kii taarikh kaa elaan kar diya
 Elections in the state will be held in only one phase
 9 november ko himachal kii janata vot karegi or 18 disambar ko hogi voton kii ginati
 In such a situation, the question arises that with the announcement of the election date in Himachal Pradesh, why has the beating of a minister of Bihar government increased? After all, what is the Bihar connection of Himachal Pradesh elections? So know what is the Bihar connection of Himachal Pradesh elections
 yah conection he bihar sarkaar main swasthya mantri mangal pandey
 Mangal Pandey is already in charge of BJP in Himachal Pradesh before becoming Health Minister in Nitish Kumar government

 That is, Mangal Pandey is performing two responsibilities simultaneously, Health Minister in Bihar and BJP in charge of Himachal
 aise main himachal pradesh main prabharee ke taur par mangal pandey ke pradarshan ko dekhen to kaha ja saktaa he ki vidhansabha chunaav main bhi bijepi kii balle-balle ho sakati he
 This is because in June, one month after becoming Himachal's incharge, elections were held in Nagar Nigam in the state in which BJP won 17 out of 34 seats
 bhaajapa ne himachal pradesh main mangal pandey ke netritv main nagar nigam chunaav main 31 saal ke baad satta main vaapasi kii thi
 That is, within 1 month, the victory flag that Mangal Pandey won for the BJP in Himachal Pradesh, will be a challenge to repeat this performance once again in the assembly
 himachal main chunaav kii taarikh kaa elaan ke saath hi abhi abhi tay ho gaya he kii swasthya mantri mangal pandey agle kuch dinon tak bihar main kam or himachal main zyada najar aaenge
 There are a total of 68 assembly seats in Himachal Pradesh and the main contest of the BJP will be from the Congress in every seat there

 But we cannot hide our failure behind the criticism of the pitch

 lekin pich kii aalochana ke peeche ham apni asafalataa nahin chipa sakate

 The Legislature Party meeting has been called on Monday at the residence of Lalu Prasad Yadav amid fears of a breakdown in the RJD-JDU alliance in Bihar
 is baithak main argedy pramukh lalu yadav samet unke bete or soobe ke dipti siem tejasvi yadav samet party ke tamaam vidhayak rahenge
 It is believed that Lalu Yadav can take a big decision on Tejashwi Yadav
 tejasvi yadav argedy vidhayak dal ke netaa hai or nitish kumaar sarkaar main dipti siem hai
 The way corruption cases have come against Tejashwi, then the demand for Tejashwi's resignation has increased
 mana ja rahaa he ki chautarafa dabaav main ghire lalu yadav bhi naitik aadhaar par tejasvi ke khilaaf koi bada faisla le sakate hai
 So that the high tone of the opponents can be stopped
 vahiin duusari taraf, bihar ke mukhyamantri or jediu ke adhyaksh nitish kumaar ne mangalvaar ko apane vidhayakon kii baithak bulaai he
 Nitish Kumar has kept his silence on the manner in which the ED and CBI are continuously taking action against Lalu's family in corruption cases
 aise main mana ye bhi ja rahaa he ki unki ye khamoshi kisi bade siyaasi bhuuchaal kii taraf ishaara kar rahi he
 However, if Lalu Yadav decides to remove Tejashwi as deputy on Monday, it is possible that Nitish Kumar will not have to take any hard decision
 jiskaa nateeja ye ho saktaa he ki bihar main mahagathbandhan kaayam rahane kii ummid baaki rahegi or nitish kumaar satta kaa netritv karte rahenge
 The speculations being made on the deputy cm's options also seem to bolster this possibility
 sutron ke mutabik lalu apane bade bete or swasthya mantri tej pratap yadav ko up mukhyamantri banane kaa faisla le sakate hai
 Because allegations of corruption have come to light on Tej Pratap, Lalu can also hand over the responsibility of deputy CM from RJD quota to Finance Minister Abdul Bari Siddiqui to deal with any upcoming trouble
 is sabake bich nitish kumaar ne somvaar ko hone vaala apana saptahik loksamvaad kaarykram taal diya he
 Nitish has canceled the program citing ill health
 haalanki mana ye bhi ja rahaa he ki somvaar ko argedy kii baithak hone ke chalate nitish kumaar ne ye faisla liya or gend lalu ke paale main daal di
 Manjhi's demand- If i remove, now also remove Tejashwi, pressurize Abdul Bari to be deputy CM in place of Nitishtejsvi RJD-JDU MLA: Sushil Modi 'lal' lured by CBI raid, IPS officer has been chasing for 20 years england ke purv harfanmaulaa cricket khilaadi andrew flintoff ne aagaamee ashes siries main australia ke khilaaf england kii 2-1 se jeet kii bhavishyavaanee kii he

 elister cook ke netritv main english team haal hi main newjiland ke khilaaf siries drow karaane main safal rahi
 England suffered a 0–5 defeat to Australia in the Ashes series last year
 flintoff kaa maananaa he ki england paanch test maichon kii siries main apni puraani majboot sthiti hasil karne main safal hogi
 On the official website of the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), Flintoff was quoted as saying, 'I think England are in a great rhythm right now
 sabhi ne unke bare main kamatar karke likhaa he or aise main english team behad khatarnaak hoti he
 ' flintoff ne kaha, 'pichley kuch hafton main maine team main jabardast sudhaar dekha he

 In such a situation, it would be really interesting to show two big beauties together in a film

 To stay updated with the latest news of the general election, subscribe to Aaj Tak's election special newsletter badi saajheedaar bijepi ke siton ke bantwaare main kisi tarah safal hone ke baad ramvilas paswan or jeethanram maanjhi ke chehron kii muskaan gumraah karne vaali thi
 The battle between them to show themselves as the most powerful Dalit leader of Bihar is going to continue even after the assembly elections
 maanjhi beman se tab naram pade, jab bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne paswan kii algepi ko di gai 40 siton ke mukaable unke hindustan avam morcha (secular) ko 20 siten deen
 The BJP retained 160 seats for itself and 23 seats went to Upendra Kushwaha's Rashtriya Lok Samata Party
 maanjhi kii fori mahatvakanksha agar nitish kumaar ko unhen siem kii kursi se hataane kii sajaa dena he, to unke lambey vakt ke siyaasi pratidwandvi nau baar ke saansad paswan hi hai

 Worse, a hint has been given to Manjhi to be included in the Union Cabinet after the Assembly elections
 agar aisa hota he, to maanjhi vaaki paswan kii barabari main khadey ho jaaenge, jabaki paswan rajya or centre donon kii siyasat main dashakon tak apane kad se badhkar bhoomika adaa karne ke hunar kaa bharpoor pradarshan kar chuke hai
 The results of Bihar will prove to be decisive in this battle of beating each other by staying in the same court
 paswan aise netaa ke taur par apni saakh sabit kar chuke hai, jo apane samarthakon ke ekamusth vot dusron ke khate main dalava saktaa he
 On the other hand, a very tough challenge has fallen on Manjhi's shoulders in the first election trial

 jisamen 8500 motorbike or kai sau gaadiyaan shaamil huin
 Apart from this, our brothers from Purvanchal, who are equal partners in the pace of development of Delhi, were also tortured by the BJP people and they showed an anti-purvanchal mentality
 iske alaava aapane dekha gujarat main or maharashtra main jahaan bijepi kii sarkaar he or vahaan bhi purvanchal ke logon ke saath atyaachaar hua or uskaa palaayan hua

 Concluding his four-day march against Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Mayawati, Congress General Secretary Rahul Gandhi accused his government of acquiring farmers' land for golf courses and racing tracks and said that when the farmers protested, they were fired on Let's go
 greater noida or aligarh jile main 70 kilometre ke apane paidal march ke samaapan par yahaan kisaan mahapanchayat ko sambodhit karte hue rahul ne in aalochanaon ko khaarij kar diya ki vah drama kar rahe he
 Mayawati termed Rahul Gandhi's march as a gimmick
 apane pratidwandvi ke khilaaf kade shabdon kaa istemaal karte hue unhone kaha ki uttar pradesh main ek kisaan ko bhoomi adhigrahan ke bare main tab pataa chalata he jab ek builder aakar usase kahata he ki yah jameen ab uski (builder kii) he
 This political campaign of Rahul is being seen as preparing for the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections next year
 rahul ne kaha ki uttar pradesh main, ham vikaas yaa sadak banane ke khilaaf nahin he lekin yah jameen golf course, coloniyaan or racing trek banane ke liye kisaanon se lee ja rahi he or yahi kaaran he ki ve naaraaz hai
 He said that the farmer says that if a rich person's land is taken in Lucknow, he is given a market rate but when it comes to a poor farmer then bullets are fired on him, he is beaten and the government does not talk to us
 Would do subah main baari varsha ke baavjood dohapar main yahaan kisaan mahapanchayat main hajaaron logon ne hissaa liya
 The Padayatra, which started from Bhatta Parsaul, the center of the land acquisition movement in Greater Noida, ended here as Kisan Mahapanchayat
 apane abhiyaan ke bare main aalochanaon ko khaarij karte hue rahul ne kaha ki kai log maanate hai ki yah drama he lekin ek rajaneta ko logon ke paas jane ore unase baatcheet karne kii jarurat he or main isamen puraa vishwaas karata hum
 Pointing to the Land Acquisition Act, Rahul said that some farmers are worried about this (law) because it is old and they (farmers) have problems with it
 unhone kaha, ‘ham aisa kanoon laagne kaa prayaas karenge jo kisaan ko laabh pahunchayegaa lekin keval kanoon laane se koi phayda nahin hoga kyonki pehle se bhi haryana or uttar pradesh kuch kanoon maujuud he lekin jahaan haryana sarkaar logon ko vishwaas main leti he or unase baatcheet karti he vahiin uttar pradesh sarkaar logon se baatcheet nahin karti
 When a farmer demands his rights, the government orders to fire on him
 ’unhone kaha ki bhatta parsul main andolan ke baad mayawati bhoomi adhigrahan par nayi niti lekar aayin lekin isse vahaan prabhavit kisaanon ko koi laabh nahin pahonchega or yahi kaaran he ki maine padayatra shuru kii
 He said that when the farmers started protesting at Bhatta Parsaul two months ago, the police opened fire on them and some farmers were also killed

 The strict rules for withdrawing and depositing money from banks broke the back of creation
 na to bazaar main hazaar or paanch sau ke note chal rahe the or naa hi bainkon main baari rakam jamaa ho rahe thi
 Due to the black money, there was no increase in the generation of banks, thus government money could not be returned to the banks and the game of creation deteriorated

 According to the investigation, government money would reach the account of creation, he would get interest from the bank also and by investing money in the market, he would get interest from there also i

 Her husband Goldie Behl and son Ranveer stood with her every moment in Sonali Bendre's Cancer Journey
 family saport kii vajah se hi sonaali bahaduree ke saath cancer ko maat de pain
 However, he is still undergoing treatment
 vakt ke saath unki sehat kaaphi behatar ho gai he
 In the 18th edition of India Today Conclave, Sonali Bendre revealed in a big interview for the first time how her son's reaction was to know about cancer? The actress told how his family gave him a slap? In a session with India Today Conclave, Sonali spoke to senior journalist Shoma Chaudhary on various aspects
 sonaali ne kaha ki ve bete se apni beemaari ke bare main kuch bhi nahin chupaana chaahati thim
 She was clear that the son would tell everything true to Ranveer
 ve chaahati thim ki ve ranvir ke prati eemaandaar rahe
 The actress said, "my husband Goldie informed Ranveer about my cancer
 ranvir ko asthma he
 Knowing my illness, he took the pump
 phir usne kaha thik he
 i read the book with my mother
 mujhe is bare main pataa he
 Ranveer supported me with courage and positivity
 ''view this post on instagramfrom the moment he was born 12 years, 11 months and 8 days ago, my amazing @rockbehl took ownership of my heart
 From then on, his happiness and wellbeing have been the center of anything @goldiebehl and i ever did
 And so, when the Big c reared its ugly head, our biggest dilemma was what and how we were going to tell him
 As much as we wanted to protect him, we knew it was important to tell him the full facts
 We’ve always been open and honest with him and this time it wasn’t going to be different
 He took the news so maturely


 and instantly became a source of strength and positivity for me
 In some situations now, he even reverses roles and takes on being the parent, reminding me of things i need to do! i believe that it’s imperative to keep kids involved in a situation like this
 They are a lot more resilient than we give them credit for
 It’s important to spend time with them and include them, rather than make them wait on the side-lines, not being told yet instinctively knowing everything
 In our effort to protect them from the pain and realities of life, we might end up doing the opposite
 I’m spending time with Ranveer right now, while he’s on summer vacation
 His madness and shenanigans help me # switchonthesunshine
 And today, we derive strength from each other # onedayatatimea post shared bysonali Bendre(@iamsonalibendre) onjul 18, 2018 at 11:29pm pdtsonali ne bataaya ki ranvir ne unka behad khyaal rakhaa

 The journey of Delhi Daredevils in the eighth season (IPL-8) of the Indian Premier League was nothing short of a nightmare
 lekin team ke coach gairi karston kaa is pradarshan par bhi sakaaratmak ravaiya aapako hairat main daal degaa
 During the tenure of Kirsten, Team India became the world champions, in such a situation, it was expected that Delhi Daredevils would perform brilliantly in this IPL
 dilli ne yuvaraj sinhako 16 karod rupee main kharida tha lekin unka pradarshan ipel-8 main ausat darje se bhi kam rahaa he
 However, in the eyes of the coach, Delhi performed well
 dilli ne chennai superkings ko haraaya lekin usase pehle hi wo ipel-8 ke plaof se out ho chuke the
 Excerpts from Gary Kirsten's talk on Delhi's performance in the IPL
 Question: The victory against Chennai was delayed, but this victory gave confidence to the team? Answer: Yes, it was a good win for us
 hamen lagata he ki hamane acha cricket khelaa lekin hamaare liye lig utaar chadhaav bhari rahi lekin top kii team ko haraana acha laga
 Question: Looking for the team Shreyas Iyer and the experience of Zaheer Khan came in handy? Answer: We are proud of our franchise that they took young cricketers
 shreyas shandaar khilaadi he usamen bahut pratibha he
 We played all the matches with him
 team main senior khilaadi ko shaamil karne kaa laalach bana rahata he lekin ham usko plaing ilevan main lekar hi khele
 Apart from Zaheer Khan's bowling, his chemistry with captain JP Duminy was helpful for us on the field
 usne 7 maichon main team main apni jagah ko behtareen tareeke se sabit kiya
 Question: What do you think about Yuvraj Singh's performance? Answer: Yuvi came to contribute significantly in the team and he did that
 aap ek diggaj khilaadi se yahi chaahate hai
 It is not just a matter of runs
 usne apana kaam bakhubi nibhaayaa
 You can make a disappointing picture for us but we have shown good progress
 pichley sijan se ab ham yahaan khadey hai
 We had won only two matches then and this time our position is better than before
 sawaalh lekin aapane to plaof tak pahunchane kaa lakshya banaaya hoga?javabsenhin, ham jahaan se yahaan tak aae hai
 Yes, it would have been nice if we had gone ahead and that was our goal
 lekin logon ko samajhnaa hoga ki aap ek sijan main team ko puri tarah se badal nahin sakate hai, iske liye zyada samay lagata he
 Question: What did you think before this season started? Answer: The franchise team let many players go
 ek tarah se ye puri nai team thi
 If you were playing against such teams, then you have been the same since the first season of IPL
 hamaare liye ek duusare ko samajhnaa or talmail bananaa mushkil tha
 We worked on it this season
 sawaalh batting order main kuch pherbadal chaunkaane vaale rahe
 Like taking down Yuvi? Answer: We just got Duminy to bat in the middle order
 sawaalh pehle match main yuvi or dumini donon ko neeche utaara gaya phir puri lig ke dauraan yuvi ke ballebaaji kram main badlaav kiya gaya?javaabah13 maichon main pehla match hi aisa tha jisamen hamane aisa kiya tha
 i do not understand what was different
 hamen laga ki dumini number 3 par behatar karenge
 For Yuvi, we wanted him to play after Powerplay

 On the other hand, if sources are to be believed, Gurmeet Ram Rahim, who is lodged in Sunaria Jail, got disheartened when he came to know about the charge sheet against Honeypreet in the court and he kept silence

 swami ne kaha ki rajeev gandhi ne ram mandir ke liye taala khulavaa diya tha or mandir ke liye shilanyas kaarykram kii anumati de di thi
 The construction of the temple may begin this year, the BJP leader said Rajiv Gandhi had started implementing the concept of Ramrajya, but things changed with his untimely demise

 par kya aap jaanate hai bachapan kii ye baat aapke bachche ke bhavishya ko kitni buree tarah prabhavit kar sakati he
 According to a recent study, when 700 people were asked about their childhood, many of them said that the virtue of materialism came from their parents
 in logon se unke bachapan,mata-pita ke saath unkesambandhon, bachapan main mili sajaa or uske prakaar ke bare main bhi poocha gaya tha
 Many people also said that they get gifts when they worked according to their parents' say
 kai baar maa-baap unhen khush karne ke liye bhi uphaar diya karte the
 When parents were angry, their gifts were taken away from these children, which was their punishment
 marsha richins joki ek shodhakarta hai, bataati he ki bachapan kii aadaten bacchon main itani gahari ho jaati he ki bad hone par bhi wo inhen chhod nahin pate hai
 According to research, very materialistic children have to grow up and struggle in married life
 unamem khud ko khush karne kii bhaavana itani zyada ho jaati he ki iske liye wo jua khilne se bhi parhez nahin karte hai
 He feels that by playing gambling, he will get more and more wealth and will enjoy material pleasure from it
 research main ye bhi kaha gaya he ki rishwat dene kii ye aadat bachche par bahut bura asar daalati he
 The child does not value things and work, he starts to look at everything in the same way, in such a way that the parents should know that if they are giving something to make the child happy, then they should also realize the value of that thing
 Get it done

 More than 30,000 cricketers had lined up outside the stadium to buy tickets since early in the morning but due to the delay in opening the counter, some fans tried to break the cordon which caused chaos

 Deputy Commissioner of Police (central Zone) G
 Ramesh said, 'those who were trying to break the line and create trouble, were removed by lathi-charge and the situation was corrected again
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘sabhi tikat bik chuke hai or ab sthiti niyantran main he
 On the other hand, Secretary of Karnataka State Cricket Association and former Indian fast bowler Javagal Srinath said, "A good crowd is expected for any good match
 kaaphi log match dekhne kii ichha rakhte hai
 About six thousand tickets have been sold at the gate
 ’unhone kaha, ‘ham ab bhi isisi or bisisiai se tikat waapas lautne kaa intjaar kar rahe hai

 ’ shrinath ne kaha ki is tarah ke ahm maichon se pehle prayek ko santusht karnaa hameshaa hi mushkil hota he
 The Cricket Board of India and the KSCA have meanwhile said that the stadium has limited capacity and also has to meet the International Cricket Council's demand for tickets
 unhone kaha, ‘is samay ham logon kii apekshaaon ko puraa karne ke prayaas ke rup main sabase badi chunauti kaa saamana kar rahe hai or ise puraa karnaa sambhav nahin he
 There is a limit to how many people we can make happy

 KSCA President Anil Kumble refused to speak on the issue saying that Srinath held a press conference

 He said on Sunday that the wishes of the sage saints regarding the construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya will be respected
 unhone kaha ki santon or karodon rambhakton kii ichha ke aage sabhi ko jhukna hi hoga
 The BJP leader said this at the Kumbh Mela in Prayag on Sunday
 prayagraj ke kumbh meley main pahunche ram madhav ne sangam darshan or aarti ke baad kaha ki sarkaar sirf adaalat ke faisle kaa intjaar kar rahi he
 He claims that the temple construction will start soon
 isse pehle, 26 janvari ko uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne 24 ghanton main is masale ko nipataane kaa daawa kiya tha
 Yogi Adityanath says, 'I will still appeal to the court to settle the dispute soon
 elahabaad hai court kii peeth ne 30 sitambar 2010 ko bhoomi bantwaare ke masale par aadesh nahin diya, balki yah bhi sweekaar kiya ki babari dhaancha hindu mandir yaa smarak ko nasht karke khadaa kiya gaya tha
 The Archaeological Survey of India excavated on the orders of the High Court and admitted in its report that the Babri structure was built by destroying a Hindu temple or monument
 'upi ke siem ne kaha ki sawaal chunaavon main phaayde yaa nuksaan kaa balki yah deshavaasiyon kii aasthaa kaa sawaal he
 The Congress is at the root of this problem and does not want to let it be resolved
 unhone kaha, agar ayodhya vivaad kaa nipataara ho jaae or teen talaak par pratibandh lagu ho jaae to desh main tushtikaran kii raajnneeti hameshaa ke liye samaapt ho jaaegi
 He says that the Ayodhya dispute is being prolonged by adding the title dispute unnecessarily
 ham supreme court se lakhon logon kii santushti ke liye jald se jald nyaay dene kii apil karte hai, taaki yah jan aasthaa kaa pratik ban sake
 Due to unnecessary delay, the trust of the people will be lost from the institutions
 ' unhone kaha ki jahaan tak logon ke dhairya or bharose kii baat he to anaavashyak vilamb se sankat paidaa ho rahaa he
 Explain that in an interview with news agency ANI, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said that the government is waiting for the decision of the Supreme Court on the temple issue
 court ke faisle ke baad hi sarkaar koi nirnay legi
 However, recently the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) had expressed its displeasure over the delay in construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya

 While the government gave incentives in saving and spending items, the discounts and proposals made in the housing sector were made thinking that there would be some expenditure on the purchase of new houses

 yah chhot pehle bhi thi lekin keval us dasha main jab aise laabh ko kisi ek nae ghar kii kharid main istemaal kiya gaya ho (dhara 54 ke adheen)
 Now the exemption from tax on capital gains has been made for the purchase of two buildings up to a limit of two crore

 Ghulam Zia, executive director of property advisory firm Knight Frank India, says people will be excited by this provision, but it is not a big incentive for the market

 Apart from this, there is no certainty that investors will benefit in the current market with less demand
 yah ummid karnaa bhi kathin he ki paanch lakh rupye salanaa se kam kii aay vaale jin logon ko ab kar se chhot kaa laabh milegaa, ve makaan kharidenge
 The government has also given some relief to realty developers in view of the need to have large quantities of ready-made units and accessories
 isane bina bike gharon ko kar se mukti kii avadhi maujuuda ek varsh se badhaakar do varsh kar di he
 This is expected to provide a major relief to the developers and they will now be able to shift their focus towards sales strategies

 According to experts, the definition of cheap housing and the actual sale of such are not very reassuring

 He said that the stringent provisions of RERA should be amended which would have a negative impact on the region

 He said that Yuvraj is a different person, his strategy is completely different from others and his style of playing is also different
 aise main ham chaahate hai ki yuvaraj, yuvaraj hi rahen
 They do not need to change their mood

 dilli main pink metro ne dilli main metro network ke shikhar ko choote hue apane safar kii shuruyaat kar di he
 The Pink Metro in Dhaulakuan area of delhi, where the metro crosses the existing line of the airport metro, passes at the highest altitude
 buudhvaar ko is line par metro ke trial kii shuruyaat karne se pehle ek metro train ko guzaaraa gaya or ye pink train sabase zyada oonchai par safar karne vaali pehali metro ban gai
 This line is part of the Pink Line of the Metro, which will run between Majlis park-shiv Vihar
 metro kii pink line par trial shuru hone vaala he, philhal ye trial mayapuri se south campus ke bich hoga, isi kii taiyaari ke liye ek train ko is line ke trek par utaara gaya he, lekin philhal yahaan overhead electricity line ko enrgyise nahin kiya gaya he, matlab train chalaane ke liye bijli nahin thi, isliye dijal se chalane vaale ek shanter kii madad se metro ko trek par chalaaya gaya
 According to the Delhi Metro spokesperson, the height of the Pink Line at Dhaulakuan is 23
 6 meter he, jo dilli metro ke maujuuda network main sabase zyada oonchai he
 Prior to this, the height of the metro was highest near Karkardooma, where the metro passes through the 19 meter high bridge
 dhaulakuan par metro saat manjila kisi imaarat ke baraabar oonchai par daudegi
 The construction of the metro line at such a height was also very challenging from the engineering point of view, because below the metro line here is the existing line of the airport metro, which is also operational and there is a busy flyover intersection of Dhaulakuan at this place
 metro kaa nirmaan yahaan raat 12 baje se subah 4 baje ke bich kiya gaya, taaki orport line kaa aaparishan bhi prabhavit na ho or neeche dhaulakuan kaa sadak kaa trephic bhi beasar rahe
 Currently, trials will be conducted between Mayapuri and South Campus metro station in the next few days

 Meanwhile, Army Chief Bipin Rawat has given a direct challenge to the stone-pelting people in the valley, he said that instead of throwing stones at us, they should fire bullets, so that i can do whatever i want to do
 news agency pitiai ko diye is intervyuu membipin ravat ne patharbaajon or kashmirake halaaton par khul kar apni baat rakhi
 Read 10 big things about this interview
 
 
 1)log jab ham par patharav kar rahe hon or petrol bam phenk rahe hon, main apane javaanon se keval intjaar karne or marane ke liye nahin kah saktaa
 2) The army chief defended the Kashmiri youth's incident of using a human shield on a jeep, saying that troops have to adopt new methods to deal with proxy war in Kashmir
 3)general ravat ne kaha ki log ham par patharav kar rahe hai, petrol bam phenk rahe hai
 In such a situation, when my workers ask me what should we do, should i say that just wait and die? i will bring a nice coffin with the national flag and send the body to your house with honor
 pramukh ke taur par kya mujhe yah kahana chahie? mujhe vahaan tainaat sainikon ko manobal banaae rakhana he
 4) General Rawat said that really i want these people to launch weapons instead of throwing stones at us, then i would be happy
 tab main vah karata jo main karnaa chahta hum
 5) General Rawat, who has worked for a long time in Jammu and Kashmir, said that in any country, the country gets destroyed when the fear of the army ends
 unhone kaha ki virodhiyon ko aapse darana chahie or aapke logon main bhi aapkaa bhay hona chahie
 We have an army with friendly behavior, but people should be afraid of us when questions related to restoring law and order
 6)unhone kaha ki ghati main kisi bhi sthiti se nipatate samay adhiktam sanyam kaa parichay diya jaataa he
 General Rawat said that as the army chief, the morale of the army is most important for me, that is my job
 7)sena pramukh ne kaha ki dakshin kashmir ke chaar jile hi ashaant hai or yah kahana galat he ki puure kashmir main sthiti niyantran se baahar chali gayi he
 When asked about the resolution of the Kashmir issue, he said that a concrete solution is needed
 har kisi ko shaamil hone kii jarurat he
 The role of the military is to ensure that violence does not occur and that the common people who do not participate in it are protected
 8)kashmiri logon se sampark ke liye raajnneetik pahal ke bare main puche jane par general ravat ne kaha ki yah sarkaar ko tay karnaa he
 He said that such initiatives have been taken in the past as well
 9)pakistan ke sandarbh main sena pramukh ne kaha ki vah pakistan ke saath simit yuddh kaa purvanumaan nahin prakat rahe hai
 10) General Rawat said that a solid solution to the Kashmir issue is needed and everyone has to be involved in it
 kathuaamein aath saal kii ek ladki ke saath balaatkaar or phir hatya par deshbhar main gussa foot padaa
 The society was shocked to see the kind of violence that the children are facing and the demand for immediate and concrete steps against such crimes was gaining momentum
 aise main sarkaar ek adhyadesh lekar ai jisamen bacchon se balaatkaar par mrityudand kaa bhi praavdhaan he
 But experience is warning us that if brutal incidents become a factor then the culmination is in bad law
 bacchon ke saath balaatkaar ke maamle main mrityudand ke praavdhaan ke peeche yah soch he ki isse sambhavit aparaadhiyon main khauf paidaa hoga
 But this argument that creates fear is such that no one can say with confidence
 ek to kisi aparaadh ko rokane main mrityudand kii bhoomika se jude adhyayan apane aap main kaaphi ulajhaau hai or bharat ke paas to aisa koi adhyayan he hi nahin
 In 2012, the US National Academy of Sciences, after reviewing all the studies related to the death penalty and the alleged fear of it, said that it does not result in favor or against it
 iskaa suzav tha ki mrityudand dene se khauf paidaa hoga, yah maananaa chhod dena chahie
 The precarious utility of capital punishment in curbing crime should also be seen in the context of the bitter truths of sexual violence against children in India
 protection of children from sexual offensej act (poxo) 2012 se judi taiyaariyon ke kram main mahila or bal vikaas mantralay ne 2007 main paaya ki desh main aadhe se zyada bacchon ko yon utpeeda kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 Government data (NCRB 2016) also stated that about 95 per cent of the accused belong to the victim's identity — family members, neighbors, friends or other acquaintances
 hamaare saamaajik-saanskrithik parivesh main is tarah ke aparaadhon ko lekar vyaapt andhvishwaas ke kaaran bharat main bacchon ke saath yon durvyavhaar kii ghatnaayen saamne nahin aatin or yah sabase badi samasya he
 The result of the death penalty will be that such cases will come out and decrease because only someone on their complaint will be hanged
 in pariprekshyon ke aadhaar par dekhen to hamaari yah soch galat sabit hoti he ki mrityudand se aparaadh main kami aegi
 The process of convicting the accused in rape cases is complex in itself and this is also proved by the Center for Child and Law (NLSIU, Bengaluru) study
 is sanstha ne poxo ke amal ke baad paanch rajyon ke halaat kaa 2012 se 2016 ke bich jayja liya
 In more than seventy percent of cases where the perpetrators were acquainted, children turned hostile during the court proceedings
 hakeekat yah he ki poxo se jude maamalon main doshi tehraana mushkil kaam he
 In only 29 per cent of the cases, the blame was proved

 We could have asked how many of our children undergo sexual abuse? How do our children become victims of sexual harassment at home, schools, hospitals, childcare centers, religious institutions and parents' workplaces? What is the nature of sexual harassment in these places and how can they be avoided? In this context, what does justice to children mean and is it limited to punishing criminals? We should have asked all these questions

 Chittapur Assembly of Karnataka is counted among the strongest seats of the Congress
 is seat se congress ke diggaj netaa mallikarjun khadge ke bete priyank khadge chunaav maidan main utre hai
 In this strong fort of Congress, BJP has bet on Valmiki Naik for burglary
 jedies ne khud is seat par ladane ke bajaay apane sahyogi dal basapa ko yahaan se mauka diya he
 8 candidates, including bsp's Devaraja VK, are in the fray here
 maujuuda chunaav main is seat par trikoniya muqabla dekhte hue congress ke priyank khadge ke liye yahaan raah aasaan nahin hogigulberga jile kii chittapur vidhansabha sitcongress kii parampargat seat maani jaati he
 Since 1957, the assembly elections have been held on this seat 14 times
 inamen 10 baar congress ummidavaar ne jeet hasil kii he
 With this, the strength of the Congress can be gauged here
 jabaki bijepi or jedies ek-ek baar tathaa janata party do baar yahaan se jiti he
 Chittapur Assembly constituency was the general seat from 1957 to 2008
 parisemen ke baad 2008 main is seat ko anusuchit jati ke liye arakshit kar diya gaya
 This was the reason that Mallikarjun Kharge went to the Chittapur assembly seat in the 2008 election and defeated the BJP candidate by 17 thousand 442 votes
 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav main mallikarjun khadge ke saansad banane ke baad unhone vidhayak pad se istipha de diya
 After this, his son Priyank Kharge went to the ground in the by-election from this seat but he could not save his father's legacy
 bijepi ke valmiki nik ne is seat par party kaa khaataa kholaa
 Priyank Kharge was once again a Congress candidate in the 2013 assembly elections
 is baar unhone party ko niraash nahin kiya, unhone valmiki nik ko karaari maat di
 Priyank Kharge got 69 thousand 379 votes while Naik of BJP got 38 thousand 188 votes
 is tarah priyank 31 hajaar 191 voton se vijayi rahe
 Priyank Kharge has landed from Chittapur to win the second time
 yahaan unhen bijepi ke saath-saath basapa se bhi badi chunauti mil rahi he, lekin ve dalit or muslim maton ke bharose jeet kii ummid lagaae hue hai
 The BSP is expecting the votes of the Vokkaliga society along with the Dalit votes
 yoga guru baba ramdevek baar phir charchaa main hai
 The Uttarakhand government has registered 81 cases against him, not one or two
 aaj tak ke saath khaas baatcheet main unhone apane upar lagaae gaye sabhi aaropon ko jhootha bataate hue kaha ki iske peeche sonia or rahul kaa haath he
 Excerpts from the conversation with him: 81 cases have been filed against you in a day
 kya kahenge aap?main press conference kar 81 mukademon kaa jawaab duungaa
 i would just say that in the history of the world, not many hard cases have been filed on any hard criminal
 ye saare ke saare aarope jhuthe hai
 i will answer all the cases of 81, 84 and 85 cases
 ye congress kii sajeesh he
 The Congress is stunned by its defeat, which is why it is doing all this
 lekin chah maheene baad congress kaa aatank khatm ho jayega or wo aam chunaavon main 100 se bhi kam siton par simat jaaegi
 Uttarakhand Chief Minister Vijay Bahuguna gave information by calling a special press conference for the cases against you? The Chief Minister belongs to the state, not to any party
 ye sanvaidhanik pad he
 But these chief ministers have become judges
 khud hi aarope laga die, khud hi faisla suna diya
 Calling the press conference itself, they are making allegations
 puraa desh in par hansega
 You have been accused of stamp duty? Baba has not stolen a single rupee till date and has done the same rigging
 main jameen kisaanon se lee he, sarkaar se nahin
 Why is the Congress blaming itself? There are three crises for the Congress - Rahul Gandhi, Scam and Baba Ramdev
 congress ke liye rahul gandhi ek bada chrysis hai
 She is antsy in front of Modi
 saalon pehle boforce or ab 2ji, kaamanwealth tathaa kolgate jaise lakhon karodon ke ghotaalon se piem samet puri congress kaa munh kaala ho gaya he
 Baba Ramdev is a social and spiritual crisis for the Congress
 aap par apane bhai ke apharan kaa bhi mukadmaa darj hua he?sab bakawaas he
 Professional criminal himself is associated with these Congressmen
 ye drugs, hatya or balaatkaar kaa kaam bhi karte hai
 We roam the search dogs day and night in our ashram so that nothing goes wrong
 sarkaar kaa kaam he jo log desh ke nirmaan main lage hai uske haath majboot karen, lekin ye to logon ke haath-pairon main hathkadiyaan or munh main taalen daal rahi he
 Like Modi, i am also accused
 ye sab sonia or unke rajkumaar kii sajeesh he
 The fakir is fighting a battle in front of the wazir
 gujarat ke grih mantri amit shah ne ladki kii jasusi karwaai
 Is this correct? The girl's father, Narendra Bhai, is a friend of Modi
 ye sidi kapil sibbal dwaara uplabdh karai gai he
 Modi is conducting a personal attack
 rahul gandhi ko shahjada, sonia gandhi ko biimaar or congress ko khooni panja bolte hai
 Is this language appropriate? Everyone should keep the dignity of the language
 desh gaali-galouj nahin, balki sushasan, vikaas or vichaaron se banataa he
 If Sonia is ill, she will be called ill
 unhen shaayad cancer he, ham to yahi dua karenge ki wo jald se jald thik ho jaaenge
 Rahul Gandhi behaves like a princess
 modi piem pad ke ummidavaar hai, lekin aisi bhashaa kaa istemaal kya sahi he?bharat maatr mitti kaa tukdaa nahin he
 Words like bloody claw are used to characterize the Congress
 aap bijepi or narendra modi ke saath puri tarah se jud chuke hai?main modi ke vichaaron ke saath hum
 What advice would you give to Modi on aggression? Modi should talk about issues with aggression
 ek taraf muddon kii baat or duusari taraf akramakata dikhaani hogi
 Both will have to be done simultaneously
 kejariwal-anna vivaad par aapkaa kya kahana he?kejariwal ne anna kii aatma ko jo dukh pahunchaaya he wo sahi nahin he
 Whether Arvind himself or his teammates are involved in this, it remains to be seen
