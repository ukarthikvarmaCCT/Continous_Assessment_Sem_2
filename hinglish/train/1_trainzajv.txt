15 minute ke bhaashan ke darmyaan kam se kam 5 baar shriman vishwesraiya ji ke naam kaa ullekh kar dijie
 Just in the media, Haldine was told that Modi gave the answer to Rahul
 bilkul diya magar kya vahi kaha jo rahul ne kaha tha
 On April 23, Rahul Gandhi had said that Nirav is Modi's case, Lalit Modi's case, Vijay Mallya's case, Rafael's case, Narendra Modi is nervous about standing in Parliament
 main aapako bataa rahaa hum 15 minute vahaan par meri spich kara do, 15 minute vahaan modi ji ke saamne meri spitch kara do, 15 minute main rafel kii baat karuunga, neerav modi kii baat karuunga, modi ji vahaan par khadey nahin rah paaenge
 We have read the statements of both of them almost exactly
 ab aap antar dekhie
 Rahul said that in the case of Rafael case, Lalit Modi and Nirav Modi, Modi ji will not last even 15 minutes
 pradhanmantri ne rahul kii is chunauti par kuch nahin bolaa, 15 minute ko nikaal kar apana 15 minute rakh diya or apni sharten bhi
 What can be a better seasoning for TV
 donon ke hi bayaan aap gaur se dekhenge to tali bajwane vaale hai
 Like there were some scenes in the cinema for the first front stall, clapping sounded as soon as the action scene came
 yahi antar aapako samajhnaa he
 Neither Rahul Gandhi will speak 15 minutes on the achievement of his government nor Prime Minister Nirav Modi, 15 minutes on Rafale aircraft agreement
 magar media main or kal ke tamaam hindi akhabaaron main aapke saamne 15 minute banaam 15 minute kii hedline paros di jaaegi
 You too will enjoy the spectacle more than a game like an IPL match
 tivi isi tarah se aapako darshak banaata he, mudde ko gaayab kar detaa he or mudde ke naam par aapke saamne manoranjan paros detaa he
 This is the character of TV
 yahi pehle bhi hota tha, yahi aaj bhi ho rahaa he or yahi kal bhi hoga
 TV questions will be made your questions
 aap apane sawaal bhul jaaenge
 No one will debate the question of what is the opinion of Congress and BJP about pension
 unke bich kis tarah kii bahes he, bank karmchaariyon kii selary ko lekar, unke kaam karne kii sthiti ko lokar congress or bijepi main kisi bahes he, aadhaar ko lekar congress or bijepi ke bich kya bahes he, donon kaa angel kya he
 As long as you are part of the audience group, you are part of a crowd, you will really enjoy that if Rahul Gandhi bathed, then Modi also shook
 ye hua chakka
 As soon as you are separated from the crowd or group like Sixty year old Kanso Devi, you fall alone
 system aapako is kadar tod detaa he ki na to congress aati he na bijepi aati he, aapaki madad ke liye
 Kanso Devi does not live in the remote Daraz villages but lives in Delhi
 pati kii maut ke baad vidhwaa pension mil rahi thi lekin achaanak band ho gai
 Those three years are trying to find out why his pension was discontinued
 1500 rupee kii pension kyon band hui yah jaanane ke liye unhone soochna ke adhikaar ke tahat jaankaree maangi
 Four years passed when the Central Information Commissioner ordered that the mistake was not of Kanso Devi, but of the officials
 magar iske baad bhi conso devi ko pension nahin mili or na hi adhikariyon par jurmaana laga
 Why was this condition of Kanso Devi, because the responsibility of providing information under the right to information is given to the institutions which have buildings but they do not have commissioners
 isi 6 march ko dakshin dilli ke muniraka main pradhanmantri modi ne kendriya soochna ayukta ke five starnuma mukhyalay kaa udghaatan kiya
 The media report at the inauguration described the five-story building as state-of-the-art building and environment friendly
 magar 60 karod kii laagat se bani state of di art building main state kaa art dekhie ki yahaan hone chahie 11 ayukta magar chaar pad khaali pade hai
 Four more will retire by the end of this year, including the Chief Information Commissioner
 aap pradhanmantri kii website par jaaenge to vahaan ek behad khubasurat baat likhi he ki paardarshita ke zarie hi logon ko barabari kaa darja jiya ja saktaa he
 Even after this, there are no 11 of 11 Information Commissioners
 agar yah imaarat kuch kam khubasurat bhi hoti he, state of di art nahin bhi hoti or 11 ayukta hote to conso devi jaisi mahila ko apni pension kii soochna ke liye chaar saal chakkar nahin lagane padate
 Now think what is the condition of the headquarters of the Central Information Commissioner, then what will happen in the states
 hrydayesh joshi kii report bataati he ki desh ke kai rajya aise hai jahaan soochna ayukta ke daftar main ek bhi ayukta nahin he
 Isn't this a joke with the country's life
 niyam ke anusaar aabaadi or lambit maamalon ko dekhte hue har rajya main 11 soochna ayuktaon kii niyukti kii ja sakati he
 It has been four years since Andhra Pradesh was created, but there is not a single commissioner here
 kerala or uttar purv ke kai rajyon main sirf ek hi ayukta he
 Himachal Pradesh and Jharkhand have only two Information Commissioners
 gujarat, goa or assam main teen-teen soochna ayukta hai
 Here also 8 posts are vacant
 bihar main maatr 4 soochna ayukta hai, yahaan bhi 7 pad khaali hai
 Right to information is not a general right
 adhikari jab bina baat ke janata ke kaam nahin karte hai to janata isi kanoon kaa sahaara lekar apana bachaav karti he
 But if there is no commissioner from the states to Delhi, then what will happen to the poor people who are wandering from here to there for pension, ration or other kind of government help
 35 saal kii rina anusuchit jati se hai
 Are divorced
 teen bachche saath hai
 They have to be sent to school
 fees kam ho iske liye jati pramaan patr chahie
 Belongs to Dakshinpuri of Delhi
 rajasav vibhaag ne kah diya ki bacchon ke pita kaa bhi jati pramaan patr chahie
 What are she doing now, she went to CIC
 artiai lagaai
 It's been two years, not yet told what the process is
 soochna ke adhikaar ke tahat jaankaree maangi to do saal se jaankaree nahin de rahe hai
 When the political party, the media does not support anyone, then with this RTI, these ordinary people are fighting for their right
 satark naagarik sanghathan kii report ke anusaar sirf soochna aayogon main kareeb 2 lakh se zyaada apil lambit he
 Based on this, it was estimated that more than 50 lakh cases may be pending in all the departments of the country
 matlab suchanaaen nahin di ja rahi hai yaa phir dene main deree kii ja rahi he
 The alert civic organization estimates that the condition of Bengal is that if you apply RTI there today, your appeal will be settled after forty years
 tippaniyan On 6 March, when the headquarters of the Central Information Commissioner was inaugurated in Delhi, a website called The Print published a report that commissioners have not been appointed for two years
 sitambar 2016 main do padon ke liye vigyaapan niklaa tha magar kisi kii niyukti nahin hui
 At the inauguration of the headquarters on 6 March, Prime Minister Modi said that 'the more transparency in the system, the easier the flow of information, the more the people's trust in the government increases
 nishchit taur par soochna ke is pravaah main rashtriya soochna ayog kii bhi mahatvapurn bhoomika rahi he
 When the Prime Minister also believes that the flow of information will be easy, then people's trust in the government will increase, then why is a woman like Kanso Devi taking four years to get information
 kyon do saal se siaisi ke mukhyalay main ayuktaon ke chaar chaar pad khaali hai
 Not only this, if you read the media report, a large number of answers are not received from the information sought under RTI from the Prime Minister's Office, it is found that information is being submitted
 rahul ne kaha ki rafel maamla, lalit modi or neerav modi ke maamle main modi ji 15 minute bhi nahin tik paaenge
 The Prime Minister did not say anything on this challenge of Rahul, took 15 minutes and kept his 15 minutes and his own conditions
 tivi ke liye isse acha masala kya ho saktaa he
 If you look at the statements of both of them carefully, they are going to clap
 jaise cinema main pehle front stall ke liye kuch seen hote the, ection seen aate hi tali baj jaati thi
 This is the difference you have to understand
 na to rahul gandhi apni sarkaar kii uplabdhi par 15 minute bolenge or na hi pradhanmantri neerav modi, rafel vimaan samjhauta par 15 minute
 But 15 minutes vs 15 minutes headline will be served in front of you in the media and in all the Hindi newspapers of tomorrow
 aapako bhi ipel match kii tarah khel se zyada tamaashe par mazaa aayega
 TV likewise makes you a viewer, makes the issue disappear and serves entertainment in front of you in the name of the issue
 tivi kaa charitra hi yahi he
 This used to happen earlier also, this is happening today and the same will happen tomorrow
 tivi ke sawaal aapke sawaal bana die jaaenge
 You will forget your question
 koi bhi is sawaal par bahes nahin karegaa ki pension ko lekar congress or bijepi kii kya raay he
 What kind of debate is there between them, what is the debate between the Congress and BJP about the salary of the bank employees, their working condition, what is the debate between the Congress and the BJP on the basis
 jab tak aap darshak samooh kaa hissaa hai, kisi bheed kaa hissaa hai aapako vaaki mazaa aayega ki rahul gandhi ne nahala maaraa to modi ne bhi dahala maar diya
 This happened six jaise hi aap bheed yaa samooh se alag hokar saath saal kii conso devi kii tarah alag hote hai, aap akele pad jate hai
 The system breaks you down so much that neither Congress nor BJP comes, to help you
 conso devi dur daraaj ke gaanvon main nahin rahati hai balki dilli main rahati hai
 The widow was getting pension after her husband's death but suddenly stopped
 wo teen saal ye yahi jaanane kaa prayaas kar rahi hai ki unki pension kyon band hui
 He sought information under Right to Information to find out why the pension of 1500 rupees was discontinued
 chaar saal biit gaye tab central information kamishnar ne aadesh diya ki galati conso devi kii nahin he, adhikariyon kii he
 But even after this Kanso Devi did not get pension nor was the authorities fined
 conso devi kii yah haalat kyon hui, kyonki soochna ke adhikaar ke tahat soochna dilaane kii javabdehi jin sansthaaon ko di gai he, un sansthaaon kii imaaraten to hai magar unamem ayukta nahin hai
 On 6 March, Prime Minister Modi inaugurated the five-star headquarters of the Central Information Commissioner in Munirka, South Delhi
 udghaatan ke vakt media report main is paanch manzila imaarat ko state of di art building or paryaavaran ke anukool bataaya gaya
 But in the State of the Art Building, built at a cost of 60 crores, see the state art that there should be 11 commissioners but four posts are vacant
 is saal ke ant tak chaar or ritair ho jaaenge, jinamein mukhya soochna ayukta bhi hai
 If you go to the Prime Minister's website, then there is a very beautiful thing written that only through transparency can people be given equal status
 iske baad bhi yahaan 11 ke 11 soochna ayukta nahin hai
 If the building was a little less beautiful, not even the State of the Art and there would have been 11 commissioners, a woman like Kanso Devi would not have had to travel four years to get information about her pension
 ab sochie kendriya soochna ayukta ke mukhyalay kaa yah haal he to rajyon main kya hoga
 The report of Hridayesh Joshi states that there are many states in the country where there is not a single commissioner in the information commissioner's office
 kya yah desh kii zanta ke saath mazaaq nahin he
 According to the rule, 11 information commissioners can be appointed in every state in view of population and pending cases
 andhra pradesh ko bane hue chaar saal ho gaye magar yahaan ek bhi ayukta nahin he
 Many states of Kerala and North East have only one commissioner
 himachal pradesh or jharkhand main to keval do hi soochna ayukta hai
 There are three Information Commissioners in Gujarat, Goa and Assam
 yahaan bhi 8 pad khaali hai
 There are only 4 Information Commissioners in Bihar, 7 posts are vacant here too
 soochna kaa adhikaar koi saamaanya adhikaar nahin he
 When officers do not work for the public without talking, then the public defends themselves by resorting to this law
 lekin agar rajyon se lekar dilli tak ayukta hi nahin honge to us garib janata kaa kya hoga jo pension, rashan yaa anya tarah kii sarkari madad ke liye yahaan se vahaan bhatak rahi hoti he
 35-year-old Reena is from the scheduled caste
 talakshuda hai
 Three children are together
 unhen skool bhejnaa he
 Caste certificate is required to reduce fees
 dilli ke dakshinpuri kii hai
 The revenue department has said that the father certificate of the children is also required
 ab wo kya kar rahi hai, wo siaisi gayi
 RTI applied
 do saal ho gaye, abhi tak yah nahin bataaya ki prakriya kya he
 If you ask for information under Right to Information, then you are not giving information for two years
 jab raajnneetik dal, media koi saath nahin detaa he tab isi artiai ke sahare ye saadhaaran janata apane haq kii ladaai lard rahi hoti he
 According to the report of the vigilante civic organization, more than 2 lakh appeals are pending only in the information commissions
 iske aadhaar par andaaza lagaaya gaya ki desh ke tamaam vibhaagon main 50 lakh se zyada maamle lambit ho sakate hai
 Meaning that information is not being given or there is a delay in giving it
 satark naagarik sanghathan kaa anumaan he ki bengal kii haalat yah he ki vahaan agar aap aaj artiai lagaayenge to chalis saal baad aapaki apil kaa nipataara hoga
 The comments 6 march ko jab dilli main kendriya soochna ayukta ke mukhyalay kaa udghaatan kiya gaya tha tab di print naam kii website ne ek report chhaapi thi ki do saal se ayuktaon kii niyukti nahin hui he
 In September 2016, advertisements for two posts came out but no one was appointed
 6 march ko mukhyalay ke udghaatan ke vakt pradhanmantri modi ne kaha tha ki 'system main jitani zyaada paardarshita badhati he, soochna kaa pravaah aasaan hota he, utana hi logon kaa sarkaar par bharosa badhata he
 Of course, the National Information Commission has also played an important role in this flow of information
 jab pradhanmantri bhi maanate hai ki soochna kaa pravaah aasaan hoga to logon kaa sarkaar par bharosa badhegaa phir conso devi jaisi mahila ko soochna paane main chaar saal kyon lag rahe hai
 Why the Commissioners have been vacant in the CIC headquarters for two years
 yahi nahin, media report padhenge to pradhanmantri karyaalay se artiai ke tahat jo soochna maangi jaati he usamen se badi sankhya main jawaab nahin milti he, yahi miltaa he ki jaankaree jamaa kii ja rahi he

 Talking about his success, Nawazuddin Siddiqui said that he never thought he would become so popular
 kaaphi saalon tak kaam naa milane kii vajah se unhen si-grad filmon kaa bhi sahaara lenaa padaa
 Talking about the promotion of his film 'bajrangi Bhaijaan', Nawaz said, "I did not come to become a Bollywood actor
 main to tivi karnaa chahta tha, lekin kisi ne mujhe mauka nahin diya
 So i only did c grade films for 6-7 years
 kai baar to ekaadh role ke liye bhi raji ho gaya
 Did not dream much because he does not touch anything
 " Nawaz has appeared in a very small role in films like Sarfarosh, Munnabhai MBBS, Black Friday
 haalanki kahani, gangs of vasepur, talash or badlapur jaise filmon main shaabaashi milane ke baad nawaz ke kariyar main kaaphi badlaav aayaa
 The special thing is that the role of the main character or hero, Nawazuddin has rarely seen the hands, but despite this he has managed to get the attention of the people
 tippaniyan Nawaz, who is a student of the National School of Drama, believes that commercial films have many layers in their characters, which makes the job of an actor easier
 17 july ko release hone vaali film 'bajrangi bhaijan' main nawaz or salmaan ek baar phir saath main nazar aaenge
 Earlier, both these actors also worked together in Kick
 is bich nawaz kii ek or nai film 'maanjhi-da mounten main' ke trailor kii bhi soshal media par kaaphi charchaa ho rahi he
 The film, based on the life of Dashrath Manjhi, is directed by Ketan Mehta
 apni film 'bajrangi bhaijan' ke pramotion ke silsile main baat karte hue nawaz ne bataaya "main bollywood actor banane nahin aayaa tha
 i wanted to do TV, but nobody gave me a chance
 isliye maine 6-7 saalon tak si grad filmein hi kii
 Many times even agreed to a few roles
 zyada sapane nahin dekhtaa tha kyonki usase kuch haath nahin lagata
 " sarfarosh, munnabhai embibies, blike friday jaise filmon main nawaz behad hi choti bhoomika main nazar aae hai
 However, Nawaz's career changed drastically after getting accolades in films like Kahaani, Gangs of Wasseypur, Talaash and Badlapur
 khaas baat ye he ki mukhya kirdaar yaa hero ke role, navazuddin ke haath kam hi lag paaen hai lekin iske baavjood vah logon kaa dhyaan batorne main kaamyaab rahe hai
 The comments rashtriya natya vidhyalay ke chaatr rah chuke nawaz kaa maananaa he ki commercial filmon ke kirdaaron main kai layer hoti hai jisase ek actor kaa kaam aasaan ho jaataa he
 Nawaz and Salman will be seen together again in the film 'bajrangi Bhaijaan', released on July 17

 BJP MP and President of the party's Maharashtra unit, Raosaheb Danve, who has received notice from the Maharashtra Election Commission in a code of conduct violation, has challenged the commission itself
 nagar palika chunaav ke tisare charan ke prachaar ke dauraan ravsahab daanve ne aurangabad main yojit sabha main manch se kaha tha ki voter chunaav se pehle lakshmi ghar aaen to uskaa sammaan kariye, unhen lautaa na den
 But keep the decision you have made to vote
 us faisle ko dimag se hi kariye
 With this statement, Danve has put the best performance in Maharashtra bjp's Nagar Panchayat elections under suspicion
 bijepi ne chunaav ke teenon charnon main apni badhat banaae rakhi
 It was being credited to Chief Minister Fadnavis that Danve's statement came
 vipaksh ne mauka lapakate hue daanve ke khilaaf chunaav ayog main shikaayat kii he
 Maharashtra Congress President Ashok Chavan, during a conversation with NDTV India, alleged that BJP was misusing power to win the election
 daanve kaa bayaan is baat kaa saboot he
 Action should be taken on them
 tippaniyan By the way, the tone of Ravi Sahab Danve has changed
 unhone apane bayaan ke samarthan main media se kaha ki unhone kabhi voter ko nahin kaha ki use paise lene hai
 While in the reply to the Election Commission, he is seen saying that he took the name of Lakshmi during the campaign and it is not wrong
 vaise rajya ke cabinet mantri mahadev jaanakar isse pehle aachaar samhita ulanghan ke maamle main chunaav ayog kii daant kha chuke hai
 The Commission not only asked to register an FIR against Jankar but also canceled the disputed election
 aise main ab maamla bijepi pradesh adhyaksh kaa he or karrwai kii jimmedaari ayog kii

 jaanakar ke khilaaf ayog ne na sirf exiaar darj karne ko kaha balki vivaadit chunaav ko bhi radd kar diya tha
 In such a situation, the matter is now that of the BJP state president and the commission has the responsibility of taking action
 a post shared by Avantika Malik Khan (@avantika_khan) on Jul 4, 2018 at 1:34am PDT (input from IANS) kendriya mantri smriti irani ko ek or jhatka laga he
 Actually, he has been discharged from the post of special invited member in NITI Aayog
 smriti irani jab maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantri bani thim tabhi se niti ayog kii sadsy thim
 Even after his ministry was changed, his post of special invitee in NITI Aayog was retained
 indian express kii khabar ke mutabik smriti irani kii jagah prakaash jaavdekar ko is pad ke liye aamantrit kiya gaya he
 Interestingly, Prakash Javadekar is also currently the Minister of Human Resource Development
 iske alaava raav indrajit singh ko niti ayog ke purv sadsy ke taur par niyukt kiya gaya haiyah faisla aise samay main liya gaya he jab pradhanmantri narendra modi aagaamee 17 june ko gavarning council kii meeting karne vaale hai
 Let me tell you that on May 15, the Ministry of Information Broadcasting was withdrawn from Smriti Irani
 smriti ab sirf kapadaa mantralay hi dekh rahi hai
 mps have also been accused of misuse of funds, recently Union Minister Smriti Irani has also been accused of misuse of MP funds
 yah gambhir aarope gujarat congress ke adhyaksh amit chaawda ne lagaae the
 Congress MLA Amit Chavda wrote in his tweet, 'smriti Irani adopted Maghrol village in Anand district to model it and she has made it the best model for corruption and misuse of power
 'amit chaawda ne ek or twit main smriti irani par apni saansad nidhi ke durupyog kaa bhi aarope lagaaya he
 Rajya Sabha MP from Gujarat, Smriti Irani, was accused by Chavda, 'smriti Irani and her staff forced the officer to award the contract to the Sharda Mazur Kamdar Cooperative Circle
 ' While the Rajput community continues to protest against Sanjay Leela Bhansali's film Padmavati, political swords have also fallen on this issue
 uma bharti, nitin gadakari samet tamaam mantriyon ne bhansaali par abhivyakti kii swatantraaa ke naam par bhaawanaaon ko thes pahunchane kaa aarope lagaate hue nishaanaa saadhaa he vahiin congress netaa shashi tharur ke maharaajaaon par bayaan ko lekar soochna prasaaran mantri smriti irani jawaab dene utar padin
 Why did Smriti Irani retort on Shashi Tharoor's statement about the cowardice of the Gharammaarajas by taking the name of scindia-diggi
 smriti irani ne twit kar poocha- kya sabhi maharaajaaon ne british ke saamne ghutane teke the? shashi tharur kii is tippanee par smriti irani ne jyotiraditya sindhiya, diggi raja or amarinder singh se jawaab maanga
 What did Tharoor say? There was a ruckus on the statement of former Union Minister Shashi Tharoor amid the uproar over the film 'padmavati'
 tharur ne kaha tha- asaliyat to yah he ki in tathakthith maharaajaaon main har ek jo aaj mumbai ke ek filmkaar ke peeche haath dhokar padey hai, unhen us samay apane maan sammaan kii koi chintaa nahin thi jab british inke maan-sammaan ko pairon tale rond rahe the
 They ran to save themselves
 to is sachai kaa saamana karo, isliye ye sawaal hi nahin he ki hamaari mileebhagat thi
 At a function, Shashi Tharoor was asked why his book 'an Era of Darkness: The British Empire in India' has a sense of anguish when he is of the opinion that Indians supported the British
 is par tharur ne kaha, 'yah hamaari galati he or main yah sweekaar karata hum
 Truly, i do not justify suffering
 kitaab main darjanon jagahon par main khud par bahut sakht rahaa hum
 Some British critics have said why i do not explain how the British won? And this is a very fair question
 ' tharur ke is bayaan par soshal media par kadi pratikriya ai
 People of Rajput society surrounded Tharoor by tweeting
 kya he padmavati par vivadacongress netaa shashi tharur kii yah tippanee aise samay main ai he jab sanjay lila bhansaali ke diarection main bani film 'padmavati' ko lekar ek bada vivaad khadaa ho gaya he
 Some Rajput organizations have accused Bhansali of distorting history and serving Hindu sentiments
 haalanki, video jari kar sanjay lila bhansaali ne sandesh bhi diya tha ki unhone film puraa sanjidagi se banaai he or kisi kii bhaavana ko thes pahunchane jaisaa koi seen nahin he
 Despite this, there is a ruckus about Padmavati across the country
 Here are moments from my morning exercises
 Apart from Yoga, i walk on a track inspired by the Panchtatvas or 5 elements of nature - Prithvi, Jal, Agni, Vayu, Aakash
 This is extremely refreshing and rejuvenating

 He went missing on 22 January

 Later a person was reported that the child is crying for the mother in the forest
 iske baad use rescue kiya gaya
 Several hundred people were searching for the child while missing
 search oparation ke liye drones, helicopter or khoji kutton kaa bhi istemaal kiya ja rahaa tha
 The most difficult thing was that there was a heavy winter in the area and it also started raining
 rescue ke baad parivaar waalon ne bataaya ki baccha khush he or baaten kar rahaa he
 In front of the local police officer, the child also reiterated that he had spent time with the bear

 The Ayodhya case is being heard in the Supreme Court and the court has repeatedly made it clear that there is no dispute on faith here
 muslim paksh kaa kahana he ki janmasthan vahaan se do sau kadam dur he jahaan iske hone kaa daawa hindu paksh kar rahaa he
 The most important link in this is the ASI (archaeological Survey of India) report
 lekin kisi bhi paksh ne ees ke report taiyaar karne vaale afasaron ko jirah ke liye court main nahin bulaayaa
 Suppose the Hindu side feels that the report supports their claim and they do not need to cross-examine the ASI
 lekin muslim paksh ne bhi kabhi ees report banane waalon ko sawaal-jawaab ke liye bulaane kii arji hoicourt main sunwaayee ke dauraan nahin lagaai
 This matter also arose during the hearing in the Supreme Court and the court also asked why there was no debate with those who prepared the ASI report
 lekin jawaab kisi ke paas nahin tha
 asi's report was filed in the High Court in 2003
 darasal, hoicourt ne aadesh dekar ees se khudaai karne ko kaha tha
 Was there a temple before? kya us mandir ko todakar masjid banaai gai
 Prior to this, a geological survey was conducted by Tosho International
 isamen jameen se neeche sau se zyada sanrachanaon kaa pataa chalaa
 The ASI was then asked to dig
 ees report kahati he ki khudaai ke dauraan ek vishaal sanrachana pai gai jo uttar bhartiya mandiron se mail khaataa he
 The Muslim side raised questions on the report in the High Court and described it only as the opinion of experts
 muslim paksh kaa kahana he ki puratatvavidon ke alag-alag mat hote hai
 But the Muslim side did not cross-examine the report makers
 shaayad unhen ye ashanka rahi hogi ki sawaalon ke jawaab unke paksh ko kamjor na kar den or ye gavaah unka na maan liya jaae
 The Supreme Court recently asked the Muslim side why you did not cross-examine experts in the High Court
 court ne kaha ees ke visheshgy court kamishnar hai kyonki unhone adaalat ke aadesh par khudaai kii thi
 In the ASI report, the structure under the structure is called Wall-16 and Wall-17 as the Idgah wall by the Muslim side
 muslim paksh pehle kah rahaa tha he ki khaali padi jameen par masjid par babar ne nirmaan karaayaa tha
 He did not break any temple
 jab ees kii report ai to ye ise idgah kehane lage
 Apparently, before the ASI report came, nobody knew the reality under the ground and all these arguments have been fabricated later
 maaloom ho ki jab hoicourt ne ees ko khudaai kaa aadesh diya tha to donon hi paksh isse sahamat nahin the
 But on the orders of the High Court, the excavation was done there in a fairly impartial manner
 hoicourt ne kaha tha ki khudaai main hindu-muslim majdoor donon honge
 Representatives of both parties will be present daily
 khudaai kii puri videography hogi
 Every material found in the excavation is recorded in the register and found daily
 khudaai main shivlinga kaa parnala or makarparalala mila he
 Temples are often made to resemble the mouth of a manger
 hindu paksh kaa kahana he ki magar ke munh vaala parnala isliye banaaya jaataa he kyonki gangaji kaa vaahan magar he
 All these things happen in Hindu temples
 muslim paksh kaa kahana he ki ees report de detaa or ye kahata ki jameen ke neeche dhaancha mila tha
 Why did he conclude that the structure matches the temple
 ye nishkarsh ees kaa he or faisla court ko karnaa he
 However, it has been clear that the ASI report will be considered as evidence in the court and it will be very important

 'foreign visits of Prime Minister Narendra Modi with small delegations to cut spending'
 is lekh main ye bhi kaha gaya tha, ‘pradhanmantri modi apane videsh dauron par naa sirf media dal balki khud ke pratinidhimandal ko bhi chota rakh rahe hai
 Officers and cabinet colleagues are also being kept away from these visits
 ’is report ke mutabik piem modi nepal kii yatra ke dauraan 42 logon kaa dal saath le gaye the
 At the same time, the team, which allegedly went with former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on his foreign tours, consisted of about 70 members, while the media team used to separate from it
 report main ek adhikari ke hawaale se ye bhi kaha gaya, ‘pratinidhimandal ko chota rakhana pradhanmantri ke us nirdesh ke mutabik he, jo unhone bhartiya arthvyavastha kii disha ko dekhte hue kharch main katautee ke liye diya
 In October 2014, the government also prohibited meeting of officials in five-star hotels
 kharch kam karne kii muhim ke tahat hi sarkaar ne sheersh naukarshahon ke bijness class se hawaii yatra karne kii bhi manaahi kar di
 Ministers were prohibited from buying new vehicles and setting up new posts
 mantriyon par bhi paanch sitara hotalon main conference karne par roak laga di gai
 Four years after those initial steps to reduce spending, India Today tried to know whether Modi's ministers are still following the policy of keeping expenses down
 We filed several RTI documents and wanted to know whether the ministers are resorting to chartered flights for their foreign and domestic visits? One such RTI was filed in the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways
 is yachika me maujuuda mantri or purv mantri kii ore se chartered vimaan ko kiraye par lene ke kharch ke alaava kaaran, frequency or yatra ke sthaan ke bare main bhi poocha gaya
 According to the reply received from the Ministry of Road Transport, Highways and Shipping, chartered planes were leased twice during the tenure of the present Minister
 pehali baar may 2015 main jab gadakari jahajrani mantralay ke liye sahmati-patr par dastakhat karne ke liye tehran or chabahaar gaye the
 It was an Embraer aircraft of the Indian Air Force and the Ministry paid Rs 81,18,000 for its use
 gadakari dilli se pehle tehran or phir vahaan se chabahaar gaye the
 From there, he returned to Delhi
 ek maheene baad gadakari ke mantralay ne phir unke liye chartered vimaan kii seva lee, jab wo pratinidhimandal ke saath bhutan gaye
 There he was to attend meetings with transport ministers of Bangladesh, Bhutan and Nepal
 is baar bhi bhartiya vayusena ke ambrar vimaan ko kiraye par liya gaya jiske liye 49,81,500 rupee kaa bhugtan kiya gaya
 Gadkari went to Nagpur first from New Delhi and then from there to Paro (bhutan) and returned to Delhi
 sanyogvash nagpur gadakari kaa grihnagar he
 Both the chartered trips of Gadkari cost a total of Rs 1,30,99,500 as fare
 isi artiai main hamane ye sawaal bhi kiya tha ki mantralay ne purv mantri kamalnath ke liye kitni baar vimaan kiraye par liya gaya? or uskaa kaaran, taarikh, root or kharch ke bare main bhi poocha gaya
 The Ministry, in its reply, said that the information in this context should be considered 'negligible'

 iske baad shuukravaar ko SCO summit ko sambodhit karte hue pradhanmantri modi ne aatankwaad ke khilaaf ladaai main sabhi deshon se ekajute hone ko kaha
 He said that terrorism is the biggest enemy of human rights and human values
 vahiin,antarrashtriya manch paceksar bharat kaa virodh karne vaala pakistan is baar badal-badal najar aayaa
 The Pakistani Prime Minister congratulated India on joining the SCO from the stage
 haalanki bharat pakistan ko is manch par bhi nazarandaaj karata najar aayaa
 There has been much speculation since this changed attitude of Pakistan and the meeting between the leaders of the two countries in a cheerful atmosphere beyond the summit
 kuch visheshgyon kaa kahana he ki pakistan ne china ke dabaav main aakar bharat ke prati narmi dikhaai he
 Prior to this summit, the Chinese newspaper Global Times had stated clearly that Pakistan will not make SCO an arena for fighting on Kashmir issue
 mana ja rahaa he ki china kii sakhti ke chalate pakistan is manch main badla-badla dikhaa he
 India and Pakistan have been made full-time members of SCO at this summit
 ab sawaal yah uthta he ki kya SCO bharat or pakistan ke bich tanaav kam karne or rishte sudhaarney main madadgaar sabit hoga? agar itihaas par najar daudaayen, to yah baat saaf he ki pakistan antarrashtriya manch par to mithi-mithi baaten karata he, lekin hakeekat main isko amal main nahin laata he
 Fearful of being isolated on the issue of terrorism, Pakistan has looked soft on the SCO platform to improve its image
 iske alaava china ne van belt van road pariyojna main bharat ko shaamil karaane ke liye pakistan par narmi baratane kaa dabaav banaaya he
 Although some scholars believe that this forum will be very helpful in settling the long-standing dispute between India and Pakistan, but the future will show how far this forum helps in improving the relationship between the two countries

 The results of the Gorakhpur and Phulpur Lok Sabha by-elections in Uttar Pradesh will be declared today
 yah chunaav upi ke siem yogi adityanath ke liye pratishtha kii ladaai he kyonki gorakhpur seat se vahi saansad the or ab rajya ke mukhyamantri hai
 On the other hand, the by-election results for the SP and BSP, forgetting the 23-year-old rivalry, will prove to be a litmus test
 soobe kii donon seat par ho rahe upachunaav kesiyasi samikarnako dekhen to akhilesh-mayawati ke gathbandhan par bijepi baari najar aa rahi he
 The reason is simple, one is that Yogi Adityanath has won by an overwhelming majority in UP and the other is that the seats of CM and deputy CM of gorakhpur-phulpur state
 phulpur: sapa-basapa milakar bijepi se kambijapi pehali baar modi lahar main 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main phulpur seat par apni jeet kaa paracham lahraane main kaamyaab hui thi
 Keshav Prasad Maurya became MP from Phulpur seat in 2014 as BJP candidate, but resigned from UP after becoming Deputy CM of UP in March 2017
 loksabhaa chunaav 2014 ke mili maton ke lihaaj se dekha jaae to kul 9 lakh 60 hajaar 341 maton main se bijepi ke keshav maury ko 5 lakh 3 hajaar 564 vot mili the
 SP candidate Dharam Singh Patel got 1 lakh 95 thousand 256 votes, BSP candidate Kapilmuni Karwaria got 1 lakh 63 thousand 710 and Congress's Mo
 caff ko 58 hajaar 127 mat mili the
 BJP got 52 per cent votes here, while SP and BSP got 47 per cent votes
 aise main sapa-basapa hi nahin balki virodh main pade sabhi maton ko mila den to bhi wo bijepi ko mili vot ke mukaable kam the
 Looking at the same record, it can be said that if votes like 2014 are held then SP candidate Nagendra Patel cannot be assured of victory even after the support of BSP
 gorakhpur: sapa, basapa se zyada bijepigorakhpur bijepi kaa majboot durg mana jaataa he
 The BJP has held this seat since 1989
 yogi adityanath ne pichley paanch baar se saansad rahane ke baad pichley saal upi ke siem banane ke baad yahaan kii loksabhasadasyata se istipha de diyatha
 SP and BSP have joined hands to snatch Gorakhpur seat from BJP
 iske baavjood vipakshiyon ke liye ye aasaan nahin rahane vaala
 Please tell that Yogi Adityanath got 5 lakh 39 thousand 127 votes in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 sapa ummidavaar rajmati nishad ko 2 lakh 26 hajaar 344 vot mili, vahiin basapa pratyaashee ram bhual nishad ko 1 lakh 76 hajaar 412 vot mili the
 Apart from this, the Congress got only 45 thousand 719 votes
 is tarah sapa or basapa ke saath-saath congress ke vot ko mila den to 4 lakh 48 hajaar 475 vot hote hai
 Which is 90 thousand 652 votes less than BJP
 gorakhpur seat se yogi kii viraasat seat se utre bijepi ummidavaar upendra shukla ko maat dene ke liye sapa pratyaashee praveen nishad ko bispi ne samarthan kiya he
 Now we have to see how the SP BSP together compensates the previous vote Yogi got
 varshon se chali aa rahi lachar sarvice kii apni kamajori ke kaaran sania mirza ko saans thama dene vaale final mukaable main shanivaar ko yahaan austrailian kii anastesia rodeonova ke haathon 3-6, 6-2, 6-7 kii haar se rashtramandal khelon kii tennis pratiyogita ke mahila ekal main rajat padak se hi santosh karnaa padaa
 Sania presented a wonderful example of a comeback
 unhone shuruaati set main pichhadane ke baad tisare or nirnaayak set main chaar match point bhi bachaaye lekin tibraker main jab rodeonova ke paas teen match point the tab bhartiya star ne dabl phalt karke do ghante 13 minute tak chale match ko austrailian khilaadi ko sone kaa tamgaa de diya
 Sania has already crashed out in mixed doubles but she is still hopeful of a women's doubles match with Rashmi Chakraborty to meet Rodionova and Sally Pearce in the semi-finals
 sania ne match ke baad media se sirf itnaa hi kaha ki maine jeetne kii bahut koshish kii lekin aaj bhagya mere saath nahin tha
 Witnessing long rallies from the baseline, the first set of the match saw both players break each other's serve to collect points, the series continued until the fifth game, but Rodionova easily saved her serve in the sixth game to take a 4-2 lead
 Acquired it
 duniya main 62wein number or yahaan sheersh variyata praapt rodianova ke liye yah game nirnaayak sabit hua kyonki dablutie ranking main 137wein number par kabiz sania is set main ek baar bhi apni sarvice nahin bachaa paayi
 He easily gave the Australian player points by making two double faults in the first game itself
 bhartiya tennis tarika apane is majboot paksh ke dam par duusare, chauthe or aathven game brake point lene main safal rahi lekin rodeonova ne nauven game main phir se sania kii sarvice par kii gayi galatiyon kaa phayda uthaakar aadhe ghante main yah set apane naam kar diya
 Sania, who returned after losing the first set easily against Australian Oliga Rogowska in the semi-finals, was in a position to lose serve again in the second game of the second set, but she not only saved the break point but with two consecutive points in her game Named but also broke Rodianova's service in the third game
 rodianova apane bacand par niyantran nahin rakh paayi jo baahar chalaa gaya tha
 Sania maintained her lead in the fourth and sixth games as well, returning from 30-40 on her serve and then taking a good few sample shots in the next game to take a second chance of a break point to increase her lead to 5-2
 sania ne nirnaayak set kii shuruyaat shandaar andaaj main kii or apni pratidwandvi ke do dabl phalt kaa phayda uthaakar pehle game main hi brake point le liya lekin chauthe game or chathe game main vah apni sarvice par niyantran nahin rakh paayi or rodianova ne 4-2 se badhat hasil kar lee
 Amid the echo of 'come on Sania', the Indian star tried to come back and score 3-4 from the break point in the next game but the old story was repeated again
 aathven game main sania phir se apni sarvice bachaane main naakaam rahi or is tarah se rodianova ko swarna padak ke liye sarvice karne kaa mauka mil gay
 Sania saved the match point in this game and then converted the disappointment into hope by taking a break point and then a service point with a score of 5-5
 sania jab 5-6 par sarvice kar rahi thi tab unhone teen match point bachaaye or aakhir main lambey samay tak dus par atake game ko ‘es’ jamaakar apane naam karke set ko tibraker tak pahunchaa diya
 In the tiebreaker, Sania lagged from the beginning
 unhone vaapasi kii kuch asafal koshish kii lekin phir se unako dabl phalt le duba

 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne aarakshan khatm kiye jane kii sambhaavnaaon se inkaar karte hue mangalvaar ko congress par tikhaa hamalaa bolaa or kaha ki desh ko vighatit karne ke liye sochi samajhi sajeesh ke tahat daliton ke mudde par jhooth kaa abhiyaan shuru kiya gaya he
 Dalits are being fooled: PM said, 'lies are being spread in the name of Dalits
 jahaan kahin bhi ve jate hai, jab kabhi ve jate hai, baar baar, oonchi aawaaj main ve jhooth bolte hai
 a campaign of lying has been launched to mislead and fool the Dalits
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘yah desh ko vighatit karne ke liye sochi samajhi sajeesh he, taaki log ek duusare se laden
 They are disappointed because power has been taken from them
 ve hameshaa maanate the ki ve (dalit) unke matadaata hai or ab modi unke liye kaam kar rahaa he
 They are afraid of what Modi should do
 ve daliton ko modi kaa samarthan karne se rokna chaahate hai
 Attacking Rahul Gandhi, Bolamodi did not name anyone, but it appeared that the prime minister's target was towards the Congress and its vice-president, Ahul Gandhi, who was recently twice in Hyderabad Central to join the movement over the suicide of Dalit research student Rohit Vemula
 Went to university modi ek jansabha ko sambodhit kar rahe the or ummid thi ki is raily se bijepi tamilnadu ke aagaamee vidhansabha chunaav ke liye apana abhiyaan shuru karegi, lekin unhone sthaneey raajnneeti se puri tarah parhez kiya
 'when then Ambedkar's name is there, no reservation can be removed' Prime Minister Modi said using the opportunity, 'the lie is also being spread that Modi is going to take back the protection from Dalits, obcs and the underprivileged
 kripaya meri baat ko gaur se suniye
 i assure the country that as long as Dr
 BR Ambedkar's name is alive, no one can remove reservation
 ’ unhone ambedkar kii 125veen jayanti ke silsile main apni sarkaar dwaara uthaae gaye vibhinn kadamon or pahalon kaa bhi zikr kiya
 He said that unity, harmony and peace are necessary for the progress of the country
 modi ne rajyasabha kii kaarywahi baadhit karne ko lekar congress par hamalaa bolaa or kaha ki jab se ek chaay bechney vaala centre kii satta main aayaa he, vipakshi party haar or satta se hatane ko pachaa nahin pai he
 Said: No allegations of corruption were made in 19 months
 Apparently referring to the Congress stopping the GST Bill in the Rajya Sabha, Modi said, 'in the last 19 months, there has been no corruption charges against anyone
 koi ghotaalaa nahin
 Those people are worried about what we should do with Modi
 isliye unhone faisla kiya ki rajyasabha ko nahin chalane denge
 We will stop Modi
 vahaan kai vidheyak lambit hai
 What kind of politics is this? desh ko nuksaan nahin pahunchie
 Modi said that the government was successful in getting the Lok Sabha to work and pass the bills
 jab ve satta main aae to sarkaar ne puraane pad gaye 1800 kanoonon ko samaapt karne kaa faisla kiya
 This was for the benefit of the poor
 'congress ne rajyasabha main atka rakhe hai bill'pradhanmantri ne kaha ki loksabhaa ne 700 kanoonon ko samaapt kar diya he lekin ve rajyasabha main atake hue hai
 What the Congress is doing is against the poor and the underprivileged of the country
 unhone kaha ki garib shramikon ko adhik bonus bhugtan ke liye loksabhaa ne ek vidheyak paarit kiya lekin vipaksh ne rajyasabha main ise paarit nahin hone diya
 The PM also said, 'the priority of the government is to work for the welfare of Dalits, backward and underprivileged
 hamaari ore se, ham koi kasar nahin chhondenge
 He said that not a single day would have passed after his coming to power when the government had not taken any good initiative in the interest of the poor

 yadi aap apana vajan kam kar itaraa rahi hai, to saavdhaan ho jaaie, kyonki moti hone ke aarope se ab bhi aap nahin batch saktin
 At least as long as it comes to other women (than)

 Within hours of the news of the murder of Pradyuman Thakur, a seven-year-old student of Ryan International School, a Gurugram police statement came that he had settled the case and apprehended the school bus conductor Ashok Kumar who was the killer

 He also claimed that on his spotlight, he had reached the murder weapon i
e
 "recovered" the weapon used in the murder on the basis of Kumar's "statement" in legal language
 is kism ke zyaadaatar maamalon main yahi hota he ki hatyare ke pakade jane ke baad maamle main media kii dilchaspee khatm ho jaati he
 The same should have happened after the arrest of Ashok Kumar

 Studies are being conducted today on the adverse effects of false confessions around the world
 america main inosense project kahata he ki har chaar ''galat dand" main se ek jhuthe kubulaname kaa parinaam hota he
 Studies show that the police often close the case once the Quboolnamas have arrived and ignore the evidence that the reversals of the Qubnamnama are taking place

 a student was murdered in a private university in Kapurthala on Tuesday night
 hatya kaa aarope ek videshi chaatr osaya par he
 a fierce fight ensued after a football match between students of Mizoram and Africa at the university on Tuesday evening
 aarope he ki sudan ke osaya ne mizoram ke johni ko itnaa peeta ki uski maut ho gai
 Angry over the death of the student, the students continued to shout slogans demanding the arrest of the accused
 chaatro ke dabaav main police ne kuch africa chaatro ko giraftaar kiya he
 The killed student was studying in btech second year
 raajnneeti main 2004 main aagaaj karne vaale rahul gandhi 2017 ke khatm hone se pehle congress adhyaksh ban gaye
 In 13 years, his party has had a government at the center for nearly 10 years
 lekin party adhyaksh banane se thik pehle rahul ne jis tarah ke siyaasi tevar dikhaae, vaise pehle kabhi dekhne ko nahin mili the
 Seeing the way in which the party's campaign was promoted by Rahul in the Gujarat assembly elections, political critics also said - 'rahul is seen from bad to bad'
 gujarat chunaav main congress ne sahyogiyon ke saath jis tarah 80 siton par jeet hasil kii, use dekhte hue virodhiyon ko bhi rahul ko gambhirtha se lene par majaboor hona padaa
 During the election campaign in Gujarat, Rahul also indicated his direction of Rajan policy by calling himself a Shiva bhakta and a Janaudhari Brahmin 
 gujarat ke nattejey aane se kareeb ek haftaa pehle hi rahul ne adhyaksh ke taur par congress kii kaman sambhaal lee thi
 Of course, the Congress could not reach a position to form a government in Gujarat, but stopping the BJP in 99 seats was no less work for the Congress workers than Sanjeevani
 rahul jaanate hai ki congress ko majboot karnaa he or party kaaryakartaaon main josh bharna he to unase lagaataar sampark main rahanaa bahut jaruri he
 In order to bring the Congress workers within the party, Rahul was suggested to sit in the office of the party as the president and also interact with the workers without taking any time
 isse kaaryakarta dogune josh se kaam karne ke liye prerit honge
 Earlier, Indira Gandhi and Rajiv also used to organize Janata Darbar
 sonia gandhi ne bhi party adhyaksh banane ke baad shuru main aisa kiya tha
 However, after the formation of the UPA government in 2004, due to security and chaos, Sonia's program stopped at the Congress headquarters and the '10 Janpath' itself became a court
 aise main ab rahul dobaaraa congress mukhyalay main puraani parampara ko jaldi hi shuru karne vaale hai
 Rahul has agreed to this proposal that, when he stays in Delhi, on Tuesday and Friday, he will come to the party headquarters and meet the leaders seeking time in the office itself
 saath hi shanivaar ko rahul party mukhyalay ke lon main dur-daraaj se bina samay liye aae kaaryakartaaon auraam logon se mulakatkiya karenge
 Earlier, Rahul used to visit Congress headquarters only on important political occasions
 anyathaa wo siyaasi kaam kaaj apane ghar ‘12 tululaq len’ yaa phir congress ke war room ’15 gurudwara rakabganj’ se hi nipataate the
 But this program of meeting at the '24 Akbar Road' as the party president will also send a message to the leaders of the party organization who come to the headquarters only
 rahul khud akasar mukhyalay main aaenge to baaki netaaon kaa aana bhi laazmi he
 At the same time, the reach of party workers and common people will also become easy for the leaders
 rahul kii is nai kavayad par party pravaktaa abhishek manu singhvi kaa kahana he ki, bataur adhyaksh rahul gandhi apane daftar main baithkar kaam karte hai, aam jan or kaaryakartaaon se mulaakaat karte hai, to ham sabko iskaa swaagat karnaa chahie, ye swaagatyogy qadam he
 In view of today's political situation, the challenge before Congress President Rahul is huge, to deal with it, before the public, the leaders and workers of his party will have to win
 isi koshish main rahul kaa ye tazaa qadam he, jisaki safalataa or asafalataa kaa faisla aane vaale chunaavon main nazar aayega

 ) After nearly 28 years, the Congress Party has organized a rally at Gandhi Maidan in Patna on Sunday
 is raily main jahaan congress party ke rashtriya adhyaksh rahul gandhi upasthit rahenge vahiin ummid kii ja rahi he ki wo apane sambodhan main shuukravaar ko paarit antim antarim bajet kaa bhi jawaab denge
 The special thing of this rally will be that it has invited all the allies of the grand alliance in Bihar
 wo chaahe rajd ke tejasvi yadav hon, ralospa ke upendra kushvaha yaa purv mukhyamantri jithan ram maanjhi
 Also, Mukesh Nishad of VIP Party, local leader of Left parties, Bihar Congress has invited everyone
 tejasvi yadav in dinon dilli main hai wo ravivaar ko congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ke saath hi sambhavat: aaenge
 This is the first time that the leaders of their allies will make a speech as keynote speakers at the Congress rally
 haalanki is baat par andeh he ki patna ke gandhi maidan main hone vaali badi reliyon ke muqaabale congress party bheed juta paaegi, lekin aayojakon kaa daawa he ki unka lakshya he ki kam se kam dedh do, lakh logon ko gandhi maidan main laayaa jaae
 That is why the party has not abstained from seeking support from Independent MLA Anant Singh
 shanivaar ko rajyasabha saansad or purv kendriya mantri akhilesh singh ne mana ki jahaan anant singh is raily ko safal banane main sakriy hai vahiin chunki wo abhi party ke aupchaarik rup se sadsy nahin bane hai isliye vah manch par maujuud nahin rahenge
 For this rally, the Bihar Congress has also invited the Chief Ministers of the three recently won states of Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan

 Rahul has announced a major scheme guaranteeing minimum income to 20 percent of the poor of the country
 iske tahat kareeb 5 karod pariwaron ko har saal 72,000 rupee kii neutanat aay kii guarantee di jaaegi
 The Congress has not given much details of this plan, so the experts are not saying much on this, but it is estimated that if it is implemented, then it will be 3 every year on the government treasury
 6 lakh karod rupee kaa boj padegaa
 Rahul Gandhi told that every year 20% extremely poor people of the country will be ensured an income of at least Rs
12,000 / - per month under this scheme, aimed at alleviating poverty from the country
 unhone kaha ki narendra modi desh ke amir logon ko dhan de sakate hai, to congress party garib se garib logon ko 72,000 rupee kyon nahin de sakati
 Congress has named this scheme as NYAY (minimum Income Scheme)
 rahul gandhi ne kaha ki yah yojana taiyaar he or yah vittiya rup se puri tarah se vyaavhaarik he
 Under this, five crore families or 25 crore people will get the benefit of the scheme
 rahul ne kaha, ‘ham desh se garibi ko dur karke rahenge
 While stating this idea emphatically, Rahul Gandhi said that those who earn less than Rs 12,000, we will ensure that their income reaches 12 thousand rupees per month
 narendra modi kii kul skim se bhi zyadahar saal 5 karod pariwaron ko 72,000 rupee salanaa dene kaa matlab yah he ki isse sarkari khajaane par kareeb 3
 6 lakh crore rupees
 yah agle vitt varsh yani 2019-20 ke liye tay kul 27,84,200 karod rupee ke bajet kaa kareeb 13 fisadi he
 Not only this, the total proposed 3 for the centrally sponsored schemes like MNREGA, Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, National Health Mission, National Literacy Campaign etc
 by the Narendra Modi government in the 2019-20 budget
 27 lakh karod rupee ke bajet se bhi zyada hoga
 This would be about 2 percent of India's total GDP
 iskaa matlab yah he ki vittiya anushaasan ke raste par bharat yaa to pichad jayega yaa iske liye duusari kalyankari yojanaon ke sansaadhan main baari katautee kerani padegi
 Rahul Gandhi said that if the Congress government comes to power, this plan will be implemented in several stages
 rahul ne kaha ki congress ne is yojana ke vittiya prabhaavon kaa adhyayan kiya he or isko antim rup dene se pehle desh ke pramukh arthshaastriyon tathaa export se 4-5 maheene tak kai daur main paraamarsh liya he
 Rahul said that Mahatma Gandhi Grameen Rozgar Yojana has helped in keeping 14 crore people out of the vicious cycle of poverty in the country
 or aaj jis nyaay yojana kii congress ne ghoshnaa kii he, vah garibi unmoolan kaa doosraa prayaas hoga
 This plan will be implemented when the Congress comes to power
 lekin vastav main agar congress satta main ai or usne ise lagu kar diya to yah duniya kii sabase badi kalyankari yojana sabit ho sakati he
 a population of 25 crores means the equivalent of a country like Indonesia
 iske pehle itane bade paimaane par duniya main kahin bhi universal basic inakam yaa nunatam aay guarantee kii yojana lagu nahin kii gai he

 In times of trouble, you remember yourself
 is maamle main shivasena pramukh bal thakare bhi koi alag nahin hai
 On the morning of July 16, when son Uddhav Thackeray was admitted to Mumbai's Lilavati Hospital in Bandra (west) due to chest pain, the Shiv Sena chief first called his angry nephew and Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) president Raj Thackeray
 india today kii jaankaree ke mutabik, sena pramukh thakare ne bhare gale se raaj se yah kaha, ''uddhav ko leelavati main bhartee karaayaa gaya he
 There is no elder to look after him
 tum vahaan jaao
 i want to see you together again
 '' manase pramukh us samay party ke parshadon ke prashikshan shivi main bhaag lene ke liye mumbai se 70 kilometre dur alibagh ja rahe the
 Raj turned back and headed to the hospital to take care of Dadu (elder brother), along with wife Sharmila and mother Kunda
 unke is kadam se manase or shivasena kaaryakartaaon main sulah kii ichha jag gai
 When Raj opened the door of the hospital's room number 604, Uddhav extended his hands
 unhone poocha, ''kaise ho tum?'' raaj ne muskaraate hue jawaab diya, ''main thik hum
 You get well soon '' saadhe teen varshon main yah unki pehali baatcheet thi
 They lost no opportunity to attack each other in times of bitterness

 Both cousins were given a grand welcome
 parivaar ke saath raaj ne uddhav ke bhavi ilaaj par charchaa kii or coffee pikar shivi main bhaag lene ke liye alibagh ravaanaa ho gaye
 The news of Uddhav's illness spread like wildfire
 sabase pehle unke paas pahunchane vaale logon main manase vidhayak praveen darekar or vasant geete the
 Although everyone knows that Uddhav does not like to meet MNS workers but he talked to them that day
 ek sutara ke anusaar uddhav ne unase kaha, ''main jaldi hi thik ho jaaoongaa or ham ek-duusare se phir ladenge
 "then he stopped and said," How long will it last? Won't we come together? ”MNS mlas became emotional upon hearing this
 ek varisht manase vidhayak ko lagata he ki uddhav kii beemaari pradesh kii raajnneeti main ''lambey samay se vaanchit'' nirnaayak mode ho sakati he
 He said, "political differences separate him but Uddhav's illness has brought him closer
" donon ke saath hamaare behatar rishte hai
 We will be happy if they reunite
 '' is saal march main manase netaa bala nandagaanvkar ne vidhansabha main kaha tha ki yadi shivasena or manase saath-saath hote to congress-rashtravaadi congress party ke gathbandhan ne vidhansabha chunaav na jeeta hota
 Sanjay Raut of Shiv Sena looked more cautious
 unhone kaha, ''iskaa koi rajnatik nihitarth nahin nikaala janaa chahie
 Blood relations are always thicker than politics
 ''sulah ke vichaar ko sabase pehle tab bal mila jab farvari main bal thakare ne kaha ki unke ghar ke daravaaje ab bhi raaj ke liye khule hai
 Raj also expressed his desire to join hands with a promise
 kuch hi dinon baad varli kii ek sabha main unhone yah elaan kiya tha
 "if you go one step forward, i will go 100 steps forward
" '' bal thakare ne apane kadam badha die hai
 It is now Raj's turn to fulfill his promise

 vah seb ke ped kii daal pakadakar jhul rahaa tha, aage vah bole, ''or tum yah kahana chaahate ho ki meraa ladkaa vanar jati kaa he, hanuman or sugriv kaa vanshaj
 Kaumudi found the words of his nephew interesting and fascinating
 vah uske bachaav ke liye aage ai
 He hesitantly said, "hanuman was not only a monkey but also a deity
 hanuman kaa vanshaj hone main kya buraai he?’’ uske pati apni patni ke is swar ko sunne ke aadi nahin the
 He said nothing, just looked at him with a strict eye
 aisa nahin tha ki sirf purush hi ajeeb kitaaben pard rahe the or vicitra aacharan kar rahe the
 Tilottama was also getting acquainted with a new world full of wonder and joy
 vah nai sadi kii dahleez tak pahunch chuki thi, or vah akhabaaron main samachar or vichaar padhati thi
 The local newspaper used to regularly monitor Almora newspaper
 sthaneey pustkaalay se or angrezi kitabon kii dukaan se laai kitabon ne use us badlaav se rubaru kar diya tha jo desh or duniya main ho rahaa tha
 He thought with great delight, "how much there is to discover in the world, to see and hear, but to experience all this is not for me!" Religion was also changing
 ek lambe-tagade angrezi bolne vaale or cigar pine vaale gerua labaadaa or pagadi pahane bengali sadhu swami vivekanand kaa almoda main aagaman hua
 He was a disciple of Swami Ramakrishna and paid tribute to him by visiting Lal Hari Shah, the owner of 'oakley House'
 swami ji ke pravachan sunne kii ijazat mahilaon ko bhi thi
 Tilottama decided that she herself would go and find out about Swamiji
 vah shishy mandali kii jamaat kii aakhri pankti main chupake se baith gai
 Swamiji's personality was magnetized, and as he entered his room, a light fragrance spread in the atmosphere
 unka prabhamandal saare kamare main fail gaya
 His eyes looked directly into her eyes
 apane shankaalu swabhaav ke baavjood tilottama ko laga ki uske man main bhakthibhaav paidaa ho rahaa he
 "every soul is a part of God," Swamiji began his discourse, "you can manifest your divinity by deeds, devotion, mental discipline or philosophy and be free
" ’’jaao vahaan koi path nahin jahannirbhay nishcint bade chalo akeleshktishaalee gande yaa singh sareekhedero nahin kisi shor jhanjhaavat yaa kisi jaal sekhmal kaa patta tairta rahata he kaise jal ke uparbina chhue use chalate raho nirbhay akeletilottama bade dhyaan se sun rahi thi
 "what is the meaning of freedom?" Tilottama asked Swamiji, "can i also eat tobacco or drink cigars if i become your pupil?" The devotee group was shocked by his questions but Swami ji took it spontaneously
 ''tambaakoo ek buree chiz he,’’ unhone dhyaan se use dekhte hue uttar diya, ''main bhi tumhaari tarah ek manushya hoon or mujhe bhi apni kamazoriyon se jujhna padataa he
 i am also a victim of pain and asthma due to my karma
 kya tum apane bachche ko ladke yaa ladki ko tambaakoo khaane ke liye protsaahit karogi? apane aap se yah sawaal pucho
 "" Thankfully you are not God! " Tilottama said in his mind
 uske kutuhal kaa samaadhaan eemaandaaree se kiya gaya tha
 He felt the peculiarity of this Q&A only when the rest of the people collectively breathed a sigh of relief
 ''utho, jaago or shaktishaalee bano tum sab log, jo mahaan ho
 Don't struggle with hard work, don't struggle
 ’’ swami vivekanand kii ankhen ek baar phir uski aankhon se milin or tilottama dekh sakati thi ki unamem hansee chhalak rahi thi
 Tillottama kept thinking on these words and was impressed by them
 phir vah apane vyaktigat sangharsh main jute gai
 She kept reminding herself, 'let alone grow like a rhinoceros!' The old man who helped her in the kitchen returned to her village
 tilottama khud chalis kii hone ko thi
 The solitude of solitude was not accessible to him
 usne khaanaa pakaana band kar diya
 As far as possible, she depended only on Kandamool fruit and milk
 apana sara samay vah hindi or angrezi pustaken padhane main bitaati thi
 His eyesight began to weaken and he took advantage of his contacts and collected an old spectacle
 chashma pahanane ke baad uski shakhsiyat or bhi ruabadaar ho gai jisase uske rishtedaar aatankit rahete
 He was respectful of her temperament and appreciated her heart as well

 One of the eight wonders of the world, the Taj Mahal of Agra is often in the news

 These days a video is going viral on social media, with it being claimed that it is near the main dome
 suraksha vyavastha ko sawaalon ke ghere main khadey karte viral video kaa sangyaan lete hue bhartiya puraatatv surveykshan sanghathan (eesai) ne jaanch ke aadesh die hai
 In this 21-second video which has become increasingly viral on social media, some women are seen doing religious activities
 kuch log fatiha padhate hue bhi dikh rahe hai
 a dome is visible behind them, whose Taj Mahal is claimed to be the main dome
 viral ho rahe video kii satyata kii pushti nahin ho pai he
 The Archaeological Survey of India has started the investigation after taking cognizance of this video
 eesai ke adhikariyon ne aaj tak se kaha ki jaanch karai ja rahi he
 Steps will be taken based on the report

 Earlier, a video claiming a religious ritual in the Taj complex went viral on social media

 However, the veracity of this video could not be confirmed
 (agra se arvind ke input ke saath) Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) leader Mehbooba Mufti has questioned the secularism of leaders like Nitish Kumar and Abdullah father-son
 unhone kaha ki apane phaayde ke liye ye log endie sarkaar kaa hissaa ban gaye the
 Mehbooba questioned the secular character of many political parties in the country
 unhone kaha ki gujarat sahit desh ke kai hisson main hue sampradayik dangon par kaaphi raajnneeti ho rahi he
 Mehbooba said that if Narendra Modi becomes Prime Minister, he will follow the footsteps of Atal Bihari Vajpayee on the Kashmir issue
 'mail today' se khaas baatcheet main mahabuuba ne kaha ki faruk abdulla-umr abdulla, nitish kumaar or un jaise anya logon ko phayda dikhaa to ve endie main ghus gaye
 He attained the pleasure of power there and left the NDA thereafter
 unhone bijepi ko sampradayik dal ghoshit kar diya
 Will joining their party decide who is communal and who is secular? Did anyone resign after the Muzaffarnagar riots? Or that someone stepped down after the 1984 Sikh riots? Why do they become so selective in terms of riots? He said that riots have been happening for many years
 lekin kisi chif ministar ne istipha nahin diya
 He said that if the head of the state does not have a hand in the riots, then he must have the courage to apologize for those riots, of course he should not have his hand in him because he is in that position only to protect them
 modi ko bhi gujarat dangon ke liye maafee maangani chahie
 He said that the Congress should not even talk about the riots because it could not get the anti-communal bill passed by Parliament
 unhone kaha ki congress ne modi ko rokane ke liye sampradayikta kaa card khelaa
 In fact, upa's performance was so poor that it increased riots in the country
 mahabuuba kaa kahana tha ki congress ne modi ko satta main aane se rokane ke liye ek abhiyaan chalaaya lekin upie kii aakshamata, bhrashtachar, kanoon-vyavastha main giravat vagairah ne modi ko majboot banane main madad kii
 He said that Afzal Guru was 29th among the hanged people
 uske pehle beant singh kaa hatyara tha or rajeev gandhi ke hatyare the
 But before her UPA government hanged Guru so that the communal card could be played and Modi could be stopped, but it failed miserably
 upie ne sochaa ki ek kashmiri musalmaan ko faansee par lataka kar vah modi ko roak legi lekin vah usamen safal nahin hui
 This further alienated the people of Jammu and Kashmir
 mahabuuba mufti ko modi se kaaphi ummiden hai

 The CM of BJP, Yeddyurappa, the champion of this game has got the green signal from the high command
 rajyapal yadi sabase bade dal ke rup main bhaajapa ko sarkaar banane ke liye bulaate hai to yediurppa oparation lotus ke jariye bahumat sabit karne main kaamyaab ho sakate hai
 Operation Lotus means that Congress or jds-elected mlas will either persuade Yeddyurappa to vote in favor of the BJP on the day of a power test in the House or persuade them to remain unattended from voting in the House
 iske badale unhen apni sarkaar main mantri pad dene kaa ofer yediurppa de sakate hai
 If the mlas of other parties remain absent even after the issuance of the whip in the House or vote in favor of the BJP, then their legislature will end under the Representation of People Act
 lekin vah mantri bane rah sakate hai
 In such a situation, after the end of the legislative assembly, the seat of the assembly will be vacant in the areas from which he is elected
 aise main chah maheene ke andar vahaan up-chunaav hoga jisamen unhe (vidhayakon ko) jitaane kii jimmedaari yediurppa lenge
 Since the party that prevails in the state usually wins the same party in the by-election, it will not be difficult for these mlas to win the election on a BJP ticket

 apni party (congress yaa jedies) kaa saath chhod kar bhaajapa kaa daaman thaamne vaale in vidhayakon ko yediurppa sarkaar main mantri banaaya ja saktaa he
