 What happened with # tanushreedutta on the sets of “horn Ok Please” is one such incident - i was there
 # nanapatekar [THREAD] - Janice Sequeira (@ janiceseq85) September 26, 2018 [THREAD] Congress has also sacked Sampat Pal, who was sacked as the commander of the domineering women's organization 'gulabi Gang' of Bundelkhand
 party ne banda seat se sanpat ke bajaay vidhayak vivek singh ko loksabhaa kaa tikat thama diya he
 The fame of Pink Gang is not only in the country but also across the border
 isaki aakraamak style se adhikari or raajnneetik dal ke log bhi sakate main the
 'gulab Gang' film is made on the theme of Pink Gang
 is sanghathan kii takat ko bhaanpakar pichley vidhansabha chunaav main congress ke upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ne gang kii commander raheen sanpat paal ko mau-manikpur seat se bin maange tikat de diya tha
 In the Lok Sabha elections too, Sampat Banda was a strong contender for the ticket from the Lok Sabha seat, but in the meantime, the women of Pink Gang showed him out in the general meeting held on March 2
 sanpat kii barkhaastagi kaa sidhaa asar yah hua ki congress ne sanpat se kinaaraa kar banda seat se apane sadar vidhayak vivek singh ko tikat thama diya
 Till now Congress state secretary Saket Bihari Mishra claimed that the ticket of Sampat Pal from Banda seat is almost fixed
 lekin shanivaar ko 149 ummidavaaron kii suchi main banda sadar se vidhayak vivek singh kaa naam dekhakar unka bhi swar badal gaya
 Saket Bihari said on Sunday, 'the decision taken by the party high command is correct
 ’ vah kehete hai ki gulabi gang se barkhaastagi kii vajah se sanpat kaa tikat kataa he
 Sampath is also shocked by not getting the ticket
 unase jab is masale par baat kii gai to vah ukhd gayi or boleen, ‘media ne bhi mere virdohi gut se haath mila liya tha, media kii khabaron kii vajah se meraa tikat kataa he
 Sampath also says that Jayaprakash Shivhare, who described himself as the convenor of the gang, never worked with him and got him sacked in an alleged meeting of the general assembly to gain false fame
 vahiin, jaiprakash kaa kahana he, ‘sanpat khudgarj mahila hai or jhooth bahut bolti hai
 Whatever be the case, but it is a matter of fact that the women organization which brought Sampath from the floor to the hailstorm, brought them from the sky to the earth in a jolt
 sanpat paal tivi reality sho ‘big bos’ sijan-3 main bhi dekhi gai thim

 The demand was made by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) activists and supporters of Giriraj on Sunday
 giriraaj ke saikadon samarthakon ne naaraa lagaaya ki aisa hi ho siem hamaara or aglaa mukhyamantri kaisaa ho, giriraaj singh jaisaa ho
 These slogans were raised in support of Giriraj when he reached his parliamentary constituency Begusarai for the first time after winning the Lok Sabha elections
 party ke ek netaa ne kaha ki bijepi kaaryakarta or samarthak giriraaj ko bihar kaa aglaa mukhyamantri banate dekhnaa chaahate hai
 This demand of BJP worker and Giriraj's supporters is going to increase the odds for the current Chief Minister and Janata dal-united (JDU) President Nitish Kumar from next year's state assembly elections
 giriraaj singh ne haal hi main nitish kumaar, lok janashakti party (algepi) pramukh or kendriya mantri ramvilas paswan par iftaar party yojit karne ke liye nishaanaa saadhaa tha
 Explain that Nitish Kumar's JDU and Paswan's LJP are allies of the BJP

 Giriraj Singh wrote that how beautiful a picture would be when, with the same desire to organize a festival on Navratri and beautiful photos would come, why do we go backward in our Karma Dharma and keep ahead in the show
 giriraaj ke is bayaan ke baad nitish kumaar ne palatwaar kiya tha
 He criticized Giriraj Singh's statement without name and said that some people have a habit and they want to stay in the news by making such statements
 nitish kumaar ne kaha ki samaaj main ek-duusare ke khilaaf galat shabdon ke istemaal se bachanaa chahie
 If someone says such things, then it is irreligious
 bijepi adhyaksh or kendriya grih mantri amit shah ne bhi giriraaj ko fatkaar lagaai thi
 He instructed Giriraj that such a complaint should not come

 reports ke mutabik is saal palghar jile main kuposhan se 600 bacchon kii maut ho chuki he
 The areas most affected by malnutrition are Mokhada, Jawar, Wada and Vikramgarh
 ayog kaa kahana he kirajya prashasanako logon, vishesh taur par bacchon or vridhon kii vyathaa ko lekar gambhir hona chahie
 According to the Commission, the death of such a large number of children in a single year is a violation of the right to live and health of poor victims
 ayog ne kaha he ki ye ilaaka adivasee bahul he
 There is lack of awareness about poverty, illiteracy as well as government welfare and health protection schemes
 bataa den ki kuch din pehle konch gaanv main maharashtra ke janajaatiy mantri vishnu saawaraa logon kaa haal jaanane ke liye gaye the to unhen tikhe aakrosh kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 a woman refused to meet the minister, giving a lot of tidiness
 is mahila ke do saal ke bachche kii kuch din pehle kuposhan se maut hui thi
 After this, the Women and Child Welfare Development Minister of Maharashtra was to come to this area on Wednesday when District Administration imposed Section 144 in two villages

 After Rahul Gandhi's statement against Mamta, it has become clear that in the Lok Sabha elections, the Congress has openly fielded against TMC in West Bengal
 rahul gandhi ne malda kii chunavi raily se pashchim bengal main party kaa chunaav prachaar abhiyaan aarambh kiya
 Addressing the people of West Bengal, Rahul Gandhi said, 'you saw CPM for years, then you chose Mamta ji

 ''mamata ne bengal ko barbaad kar diya'congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi bengal kii dharti se mamata par tikhaa prahaar kiya

 On August 10, after the Supreme Court order, the Delhi Development Authority (DDA), under the Union Ministry of Urban Development, demolished the Ravidas temple in Tughlakabad, Delhi, protesting against it
 dilli ke ramlila maidan main 21 agast ko bhim army samet vibhinn dalit sanghathanon ne bada virodh-pradarshan kiya or centre sarkaar ke khilaaf naare lagaae
 In fact, Guru Ravidas Jayanti Samaroh Samiti and other Dalit organizations attached to Tughlakabad's Ravidas temple are blaming the DDA for the demolition of the temple
 dilli sarkaar main samaaj kalyaan or anusuchit jati evam janajati maamalon ke mantri rajendra paal gautam kaa kahana he, ''ravidaas mandir giraae jane se dalit samudaay aahat he
 We are with him at this moment
 par yah puraa masalaa centre sarkaar, didie or uparajyapal ke kshetra kaa he
 The central government and the DDA could have saved the temple if they wanted
 '' darasal, didie ke mutabik, yah mandir avaidh tareeke se green belt (sangrakshit van kshetra) main bana tha or uski jameen didie kii he
 The Supreme Court, while passing a judgment against the committee, ordered the removal of the Ravidas temple
 haalanki basapa adhyaksh mayawati ne dilli kii aam aadmi party kii sarkaar ko bhi iskaa jimmedaar tehraate hue kaha ki ravidaas mandir ko centre or dilli sarkaar kii mileebhagat se giravaaya gaya he
 Congress is also targeting the central government in this matter
 21 agast ke virodh-pradarshan ke dauraan bhim army ke netaa chandrashekhar samet kul 96 pradarshnakariyon kii giraftaar ke agle din congress mahasachiv priyanka gandhi ne twit kiya, ''bhaajapa sarkaar pehle karodon dalit bahanon-bhaaiyon kii saanskrithik viraasat ke pratik ravidaas mandir sthal se khilwaad karti he or jab desh kii rajdhani main hajaaron dalit bhai-bahan apni aawaaj uthaate hai to bhaajapa un par lathi barsaati he, aansu gas chalavati he, giraftaar karti he

 Dalit organizations believe that Sant Ravidas came to Delhi in the year 1509 and the ruler Sikander Lodi had revered the land in Tughlakabad
 samiti ne daawa kiya tha ki unke ek purvaj ne kareeb 160 saal pehle vahaan ek talab khoda tha or paas main jhonpadi bhi banaai thi
 Later Ravidas followers built the Ravidas temple there
 congress netaa mira kumaar ke mutabik, unke pita or purv up-pradhanmantri jagjivan ram ne 1959 main ravidaas mandir kaa udghaatan kiya tha
 But since 1986, there is a dispute in court between the DDA and the committee
 2018 ke hycourt ke faisle ko barkaraar rakhte hue is saal april main supreme court ne mandir ko hataane kaa aadesh diya
 On August 9, the court again asked to vacate the place within a day
 supreme court ne is faisle ko rajnatik mudda nahin banane kii hidaayat di he
 But his decision became the cause of political and social controversy

 They are believed to be from the Dalit community

 According to Ronki Ram, he is very popular especially in Punjab, also because his Bani (verse) has found a place in the Guru Granth Sahib
 punjab kii charchit yuva gayika ginni maahi kahati hai, ''guru ravidaas hamaari prerana hai
 He taught equality and gave the idea of a non-discriminatory world as Begampura
 '' jaahir he, daliton main ravidaas ke prati gahari aasthaa he or unke aitihaasik mandir ko dhahaae jane se unhen chot pahunchi he
 Chandrashekhar, the leader of the Bhima Army, also mentioned the same 'faith' on 21 August
 vahiin uttar-pashchim dilli ke purv saansad udit raaj supreme court ke ravaie par bhi sawaal uthaate hai
 He says, "even assuming the Ravidas temple was in an illegal place, then it would be good for the court to take such a view of the thousands of temples of Hindu deities on various roads
 par aisa nahin he
 "bihar incharge of Bhim Army Manoj Bharti also asks a similar question," This is our old historical site, the government is ignoring our history
 ayodhya masale ko dekhie, vahaan hinduvaadiyon ke itihaas ko vailu dete hue supreme court main us par lambii bahes chal rahi he
 Then why our history is being cheated ''is saal ke aakhir main haryana main or agle saal kii shuruyaat main dilli main vidhansabha chunaav hone hai
 In such a situation, no political party will want to buy the anger of Dalits
 yahi vajah he ki bhaajapa ne bhi ravidaas mandir dhahaae jane kaa thikra aam aadmi party par phoda he
 On August 24, Delhi BJP President Manoj Tiwari questioned that when such a big event was going to happen, Delhi government officials were asleep
 unhone kaha, ''jahaan ravidasji kaa mandir tha, vahiin banegaa, chaahe bhaajapa ko court janaa pade yaa centre sarkaar ko koi faisla lenaa pade
 At the same time, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has asked the Central Government to bring an ordinance and give that land for Ravidas Temple

 Mohan Bhagwat said in a ceremony in Cuttack, 'if there are English people living in England, there are Germans living in Germany and there is a Meriki living in America , then why can't all the people living in India be Hindus?' Said, 'the cultural identity of all Indians is Hindutva and the descendants of this great culture living in the country'
 unhone kaha ki hindutv ek jivan style he or kisi bhi ishwar kii upasna karne vaala yaa kisi kii upasna nahin karne vaala bhi hindu ho saktaa he
 Quoting Swami Vivekananda, Bhagwat said that not worshiping a god does not necessarily mean that a person is an atheist
 unhone kaha,' haalanki jiskaa khud main vishwaas nahin he wo nishchit taur par naastik he
 He said that the world has now recognized that Hindutva is the only foundation that has kept India united despite all the diversities since ancient times

 454 On 11 February, news of Rahul Gandhi and Akhilesh Yadav's roadshow had been coming for several days in Benares
 iske liye congress party ke log taiyaari main bhi jute the
 The route was also decided and the news of SPG people coming to the city was also prominently featured in the local newspaper
 lekin guuruuvaar kii der raat jab is road sho ke nahin hone kii khabar ai to yah baat charchaa kaa vishay ban gai
 Congressmen said that since Buddha Ravi Das celebrates the birth anniversary of Saint Ravidas and a large number of his followers come here, this road show has been canceled in view of the crowd
 tippaniyan Significantly, the first phase of voting is on the 11th
 sutron ke mutabik jis tarah loksabhaa chunaav main pehle charan ke matdaan ke din modi kaa road sho banaras main hua tha or uskaa asar bhi dikhaai padaa tha
 This road show was set by Prashant Kishore on the same lines but Akhilesh was already scheduled for the 11th
 isaliye donon kaa sanyukt rup se kaarykram nahin ban paa rahaa tha
 For this reason, the SPG had been watching the preparations for Banaras since 3 days, even then the official program was not made
 banaras ke jiladhikari yogeshwar ram mishra bhi kehete he ki unke paas siem akhilesh ke aane kaa koi protocol nahin aayaa tha
 That is why they had no idea about this program
 darasal sapa-congress gathbandhan ke baad banaras main is saajha raily ke saath donon hi partiyaan ek bada sandesh dena chaahati hai
 This road show is also important because Banaras is considered to be the stronghold of PM Modi
 aise main sapa-congress chaahati he ki rahul or akhilesh yahaan se akele kii jagah saajha raily hi karen
 In such a situation, in the event of Akhilesh coming to Banaras, the Congress took the cover of Ravidas Jayanti and said that the road show has been canceled due to the crowd
 congress ke log kehete hai ki ab yah road sho 16 taarikh ke namakan kii antim taarikh ke baad kisi bhi din kiya ja saktaa he
 By the way, PM Modi's rally in Banaras is already proposed on 3 March
 banaras or uske aasapaas ke jile main chunaav antim charan main 8 taarikh ko hona he
 Significantly, the first phase of voting is on the 11th
 sutron ke mutabik jis tarah loksabhaa chunaav main pehle charan ke matdaan ke din modi kaa road sho banaras main hua tha or uskaa asar bhi dikhaai padaa tha

 By the way, PM Modi's rally in Banaras is already proposed on 3 March
 banaras or uske aasapaas ke jile main chunaav antim charan main 8 taarikh ko hona he
 In fact, with this shared rally in Banaras after sp-congress alliance, both parties want to give a big message
 yah road sho isliye bhi ahm he kyonki banaras piem modi kaa garh mana jaataa he
 In such a situation, the sp-congress wants Rahul and Akhilesh to start a common rally instead of alone
 aise main is vakt akhilesh ke banaras na aa paane ki sthiti main congress ne ravidaas jayanti kii aad lete hue kah diya ki bheed kii vajah se road sho ko radd kar diya gaya he
 Congressmen say that now this road show can be done any day after the last date of nomination of 16th
 vaise banaras main piem modi kii raily 3 march ko pehle se prastaavit he
 Elections in Benares and its adjoining district are to be held in the final phase on the 8th
 aam aadmi party ab nae kanoonee pachade main funs gai he or yah itnaa gambhir masalaa he ki arvind kejariwal kii party kii manyata bhi nirast ho sakati he
 Actually, every party has to give affidavits of 100 people to get recognition
 shart yah hoti he ki sabhi 100 log party ke sadsy hon or kisi duusari party se unka taalluk na ho
 Among those whose affidavits were given by the AAP, there were two people who were members of the Janrajya Party and did not resign
 janrajya party ne is maamle ko lekar chunaav ayog se shikaayat kii he or AAP kii sadsyta radd karne kii apil kii he
 Legal experts believe that although there is a provision for formation of a party under the Representation of People's Act, nothing has been said to cancel its registration
 lekin, supreme court kaa ek aisa faisla he, jiske mutabik kuch maamalon main chunaav ayog party kaa panjikaran radd kar saktaa he
 Raghav Awasthi, the names given in the plea of jan Rajya Party, have been found to be forgery
 patiala house court ne exiaar ke nirdesh die hai
 Also, we have filed a writ in this matter in the High Court as well
 2002 kaa ek faisla he, jisamen kaha gaya he ki agar party galat halafanama detii he to chunaav ayog uskaa panjikaran radd kar saktaa he
 The party-change law will not apply to that party
 iskaa matlab ye hua ki unke emele yaa empi nirdaleey maane jaaenge
 The Janarajya Party has also complained to the Election Commission regarding this matter and appealed to revoke the recognition of the AAP
 duusari taraf janrajya party kii shikaayat par patiala house court ne dhokhadhadi or sajeesh kii dhaaraon ke tahat police ko exiaar darj karne ke nirdesh de die hai, jis par parliament street thane main exiaar darj ho gai he
 Virag Gupta, Advocate - Supreme Court Association for Social Welfare Verses The Supreme Court in the Indian National Congress has said that if someone gives an affidavit wrong, forgeries, the Election Commission can revoke its recognition
 niyam ke mutabik kisi bhi party kii manyata tabhi radd ho sakati he jab halafname farji hon or is maamle main ab tak yah paimaana feet baithta dikhaai de rahaa he
 The court has also considered it a case of forgery
 aise main gend chunaav ayog ke paale main he
 If the recognition is canceled, the party's mps and mlas will be called independents
 patiala house court main is maamle kii agali sunwaayee ab 20 agast ko hogi
 Court also reached the matter, an appeal has also been made in this court in the court of Ball EC on the other side
 court ne is maamle main cese darj karne kaa aadesh diya he or dilli ke parliament street thane main exiaar darj bhi kar lee gai he
 According to the rule, the recognition of any party can be revoked only if these affidavits are fake and so far this scale seems to be fit in this case
 court ne bhi ise farjivade kaa maamla maan liya he
 In such a situation, the ball is in the court of the Election Commission
 agar manyata radd kii gai to party ke vidhayak nirdaleey vidhayak kehlaayenge
 BJP made contact, we have evidence: Rajesh Gargov, the issues of government formation are continuing
 AAP vidhayak rajesh garg ne bijepi par unke vidhayak todane kii koshish karne kaa aarope lagaaya he
 He said that he was approached by BJP and a video of this is available as evidence
 unhone kaha ki unke vidhayak kisi haalat main nahin tootenge
 It is worth noting that there is also a meeting of AAP mlas at the Constitution Club at 4 pm today

 This website caused a lot of controversy in the school
 students kaa maananaa tha ki is tarah photo aplod karnaa unki personal life main dakhsandaji karne ke baraabar he
 But Mark did not lose courage and the number of users of facemass reached about 1 million

 Manu began to tease Manveer Rohan that a lot of girls would come to pick him up, so 'bigg Boss' played this song
 dopaher ko 'big bos' ne gharavaalon ke liye bibi mela task introdeus kiya
 Under this task, he gave different stalls to the family and made Rohan a horse

 gharavaalon ke saath thodi masti majaak karne ke baad mandana ne lopa se kaha ki vah miss india hai lekin unhen baar-baar logon ko yah bataane kii jarurat nahin he
 She also told Lopa that she behaves like a little girl
 apni haar bardaasht nahin kar paati hai or jo pichley do dinon main unhone 'big bos' ke bare main jo kuch bhi kaha unhen nahin kahana chahie tha
 Mandana also said that at times he behaved like Swami Om and Priyanka Jagga, but he is not expected to behave like that
 isliye acha nahin lagata
 Lopa, hurt by the words of Mandana, started insisting on going home
 mandana ne yah bhi kaha ki jis thali main khate hai usamen chhed nahin kerani chahie
 Lopamudra is irritated again after Mandana leaves, she starts saying that Mandana likes Bani and is talking about her
 ek baar phir 'big bos' par dosha madhte hue lopa ne kaha ki pataa nahin 'big bos' unako kaise dikhaa rahe hai, unhen lagata he ki 'big bos' hi unke khilaaf ho gaye hai
 She started crying that she did not want to go to the finale, her life was getting worse
 is par bani ne unhen samajhaate hue kaha ki sho main kabhi na kabhi sabko laga he ki yahaan kya kar rahe hai, lekin aapako 'big bos' par bharosa karnaa chahie
 Manveer and Nitibha spent a good time together

 Nitibha was asked a question on which housewife she was disappointed with after going out, but she told that she was not disappointed but she did feel sorry that Manu had told Manveer that Nitibha did not even call her after leaving the house
 Will raise
 vahiin nitibha ne bataaya ki baahar manavir ke fain unhen bhabhi bula rahe hai or unki dosti ke bare main bahut zyada baat kii ja rahi he
 At the same time, Nitibha told Manveer that whatever Miss Understanding happened between them was due to Manu
 gharavaalon ke saath thodaa vakt bitaane ke baad nitibha ghar se baahar chali gayi

 meley main pehali mehmaan ke rup main mandana karimi ain
 After joking with the family a little, Mandana told Lopa that she was Miss India but she did not have to tell people repeatedly
 unhone lopa se yah bhi kaha ki vah ek choti bacchee kii tarah bartaav karti hai
 She is unable to bear her defeat and should not have said what she said about 'bigg Boss' in the last two days
 mandana ne yah bhi kaha ki unka bartaav kai baar swami om or priyanka jagga kii tarah lagata he, lekin unase vaise bartaav kii ummid nahin he
 So it does not look good
 mandana kii baton se aahat lopa ghar jane kii jid karne lageen
 Mandana also said that one should not make a hole in the plate in which we eat
 mandana ke jane ke baad lopamudra phir se chidh gayi, vah kehane lageen ki mandana bani ko pasand karti hai is vajah se unke bare main aisa bol rahi hai
 Once again blaming 'bigg Boss', Lopa said that he does not know how 'bigg Boss' is showing him, he feels that 'bigg Boss' has turned against him
 vah rone lageen ki unhen phinale main nahin janaa he, unki jindagi kharaab ho rahi he
 On this, Bani explained to them that at some point in the show, everyone felt what they are doing here, but you should trust 'bigg Boss'
 manavir or nitibha ne saath main acha vakt bitaayaa
 The comments iske baad meley main agle mehmaan ke rup main nitibha kaul ain
 Manveer and the rest of the family were very happy to see Nitibha

 pradhanmantri narendra modi desh-videsh main jahaan bhi jate hai, unki poshaak bhi surkhiyaan batorti hai
 In the country where Modi goes, the impression of that place is often seen in his costumes
 ab wo suut ho, yaa kurte hon yaa sir dhakne ke liye topi aadi, sab ke tarah-tarah ke rang piem modi ko anya ganmaanya vyaktiyon kii maujuudagi main bhi vishisht pahchaan dete hai
 But like many other politicians, does Prime Minister Modi have any prejudice about any color
 congress saansadashashi tharur kaa kahana he ki piem modi ko hare rang ko lekar purvaagrah he
 Tharoor links this to 'communal politics' and 'intolerance'
 varisht congress netaa tharur ne ravivaar ko sawaal kiya, ‘pradhanmantri modi hare rang se kyon dur rahete hai
 Tharoor also claimed that Prime Minister Modi never wore a green dress
 darasal, tharur tiruvanantpuram main ek seminar ko sambodhit kar rahe the
 The theme of the seminar was 'standing Against Hate: Violence and Intolerance in Contemporary India'
 is dauraan tharur ne kaha ki aapane unhen (modi ko) tarah-tarah ke mjedaar asaadhaaran paridhaanon main dekha hoga
 But even then they do not always say one color, why do they not wear green clothes? Tharoor claimed that Modi identifies green color with Muslim appeasement
 tharur ne sampradayik hinsa badhane kaa hawala dete hue ye kaha
 According to Tharoor, this is happening due to increasing 'intolerance' for which the leaders of the ruling government are responsible
 india today fact check team ne padtaal se ye jaanane kii koshish kii ki kya pradhanmantri ko vaaki kisi rang ko lekar purvaagrah he, kya vah sach main haraa rang pahanane se bachate hai
 Also did he never wear a green garment, as Tharoor has claimed
 shashi tharur ke bhaashan kaa anshashashi tharur ne apane bhaashan main modi par aarope lagaaya ki wo tarah ke headgrs (topi aadi) pahante hai lekin muslim topi pahanane se inkaar kar dete hai
 Tharoor was possibly referring to Modi's Sadbhavna Yatra in 2011 in which he refused to wear a Muslim cap on behalf of an Imam
 modi ne tab vinamrata se imam se shawl dene ke liye kaha tha
 Then he accepted the shal given by the Imam
 lekin sawaal he ki shashi tharur apane is kathan ko lekar tathyaatmak rup se kitna sahi hai
 For this, when we looked at the costumes worn by Prime Minister Modi on various occasions in India and abroad, we found that during the ASEAN conference in Kuala Lumpur at the dinner hosted by the then Prime Minister of Malaysia, Najib Rajak, PM Modi gave green Malaysian jacket or tang Wore a suit
 lekin yahaan ye bataanaa jaruri he ki us ratribhoj ke liye dress code tay tha
 From Modi to the then US President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping wore similar dress in different colors
 lekin kya ye akelaa avasar tha jab pradhanmantri modi ne hare rang kii poshaak pahani, wo bhi dress code ke dabaav ke chalate? isaki padtaal main ham bhartiya janata party kii aadhikarik website par pahunche
 PM Modi can be seen in various colors of costumes in the website gallery
 pehali teen tasveeron main pradhanmantri hare kurta pahane dekhe ja sakate hai
 What is there in the biography written on Prime Minister Modi, does Modi avoid the green color or does he associate this color with the Muslims? On this, Neelanjan Mukhopadhyay, author of the biography "narendra Nodi: The Man, The Times" written on Prime Minister Modi, refers to Chauhan Brothers of Ahmedabad
 yahaan bataa den ki chouhan bros kaa ‘jed blue’ ke naam se diziner brand he
 These brothers named Bipin and Jitendra Chauhan are considered to be one of Modi's stylists
 mukhopadhyaay ne kitaab ke ek adhyay ‘da modi kurta’ main bipin chouhan ke bayaan kaa zikr kiya he
 In it, Bipin said that 'modi never really wears green and is also very cautious about black
 kuch bhi ‘jet-blike’ ho, usase wo dur rahete hai
 Yes, they are comfortable in the black striped dress in the evening
 ye baar-baar puche jane vaale sawaal kaa sabase pratyaashit jawaab ho saktaa he
 But saffron is actually Modi's favorite color
 haalanki ve is rang ke chatkh swaroop se bachate hai or gahare or shant ko tarjeeh dete hai
 The India Today Fact Check team approached Bipin Chauhan, owner of 'jade Blue' and wanted to know about it
 hamane chouhan se poocha ki kya modi vaaki hare rang se dur rahete hai kyonki ise muslimon se judaa bataaya jaataa he? is par bipin chouhan ne kaha, ‘aisa kahana puri tarah galat he
 The Prime Minister has no such feelings or animosity about this color
 ’jab chouhan ko mukhopadhyaay kii kitaab kaa hawala dekar poocha gaya ki kya unhone kabhi haraa rang nahin pahana? is par chouhan ne kaha ki bharat main purushon ke fishan jagat main hare ko saadhaarant: pasandida rang nahin mana jaataa
 How many male celebrities do you see wearing green? Not much
 haa pradhanmantri iveri, halke kriim rang ko pasand karte hai

 gujarat ke ahmedabad main jila panchayat kii ek mahila sadsy ne aisa kuch kiya he ki jisaki har taraf charchaa ho rahi he
 Savitri Ben Rathore, who was a member of the District Panchayat of Ghagra, gave birth to 'two children' within a period of 21 days
 ' aap chaunk rahe honge ki ye bhala kaise ho saktaa he
 If there is no twin, then medical science also considers a difference of nine months in the birth of two children from a mother
 chaliye aapako zyada nahin ulajhaate, bataa hi dete hai ki maajaraa kya he
 This 21-day difference between the birth of Savitri Ben's second and third child is due to document manipulation
 darasal,gujaratmen panchayat ummidavaar banane ke liye do bacchon kii niti lagu he
 Those with more than two children cannot be candidates
 haalanki iske liye ek cat of date bhi nirdhaarit he jiske mutabik 4 agast 2005 ke baad agar kisi kii teesri santan hui he to wo panchayat ummidavaar nahin ban saktaa
 Savitri Bain won the election in 2015 from Ghagra constituency
 ek pratidwandvi ne savitri ben ke nirvachan ko chunauti dete hue kaha ki unhen ayogy tehraaya jaae
 According to the complaint, Savitri Ben's third child was born after 4 August 2005, but she showed it in her election affidavit on 22 April 2004
 adhikariyonne jab is shikaayat kii jaanch ke liye sunwaayee kii to ye chunaav halafname par najar daalane se doodh kaa doodh or pani kaa pani ho gaya
 Actually in this affidavit Savitri Ben showed the date of birth of her third child on 22 April 2004
 lekin apane duusare bachche kii janmatithi bhi 1 april 2004 dikhaa rakhi thi
 In this way only 21 days difference was shown in the birth of both the children
 nateeja ye hua ki savitri ben ko somvaar ko panchayat sadsy ke taur par ayogy ghoshit kar diya gaya

 This is the story of Riya Sharma, who lives in Gurgaon, adjacent to Delhi
 riya acid hamalon kii shikaar ladakiyon va mahilaon kii ladaai lard rahi hai, unka ilaaj karaati hai, unhen kanoonee ladaai ladane main madad karti hai or saath hi in mahilaon ko apane pairon par khadey hone ke liye kaam dilaane kii koshish karti hai
 How Riya's journey started? Sharma had completed his schooling from a school in Gurgaon
 iske baad vah fishan digining kaa course karne britain chali gayi
 Even after 2 years in the course, Riya did not mind it
 tisare saal riy ke professor ne unase kaha ki agar wo isi tarah padhai karti raheen to rigelt acha nahin hoga
 While talking, the professor asked her what she wanted to do
 She said in response that she wants to work for the rights of women, but she does not know anything about the work related to it
 iske baad unhen professor ne kaha ki ghar jaao or is par research karo
 Then what? Riya came home and researched many issues related to rape, acid attack related to women
 is research ke dauraan vah is baat ko jaanakar behad dukhi huin ki kaise manachale log ladakiyon or mahilaon par acid phenk dete hai
 After facing that terrible suffering, how their lives become a little limited
 iske baad unhone acid atake peediton par jaankaree jutani chaahi par unhen zyada kuch hasil nahin hua
 The next day, Riya showed some pictures of her professor coached attack victims and said that she wanted to work for them
 unke professor bahut khush hue or unako video camera dete hue kaha ki tum bharat jaakar is vishay par documentry banane kii koshish karo
 In this way, Riya took interviews of many girls in different places after coming to India to support the acid-burned girls
 is dauraan unki kai acid peedit ladakiyon or mahilaon se dosti ho gai
 She started trying to meet even the small needs of those victims
 phir dhire-dhire unka un ladakiyon or mahilaon ke saath bhaavnaatmak judaav ho gaya
 Now Riya started feeling a positive change in herself and this work became her passion
 ek baar vah documentry banane ke liye bangaleru ke sarkari hospital gayi thim
 There he saw that the ground, wall and bed of the hospital were covered with blood and pieces of flesh
 vah yah dekhakar chaunk gayi ki vahaan par doctor bhi paryaapt sankhya main nahin the
 While the other staff did not mind all these things
 un maance ke tukdon ke bich se hi log guzar rahe the
 Seeing this painful scene, Riya made a firm determination and she started her work in Delhi in April 2014
 unhone apni sanstha ‘mek lav note scare’ ke jariye acid peediton kii madad karne kaa bidaa uthaaya
 Under this, she tries to help the women who are victims of acid in every way
 riya peediton kii medical or padhai kii jaruraton se lekar unke kanoonee maamalon ko ladane or unako muaavja dilaane ke kaamon main bhi yathasambhav madad karti hai
 How Madadariya has also opened a center for the development of acid attack victims, where she provides vocational and skill training to the victims
 iske alaava vah unamem aatmavishvaas lautaane ke liye unki counselling bhi karwaati hai, jisase ki peedita samaaj kii mukhyadhara se jud saken
 In this center, girls are given basic training in English and computers
 iske baad jo jis kshetra main janaa chaahati he us hisaab se unki madad bhi kii jaati he
 Riya also runs dancing, singing, makeup workshops for these people
 mechap artiston kii madad se vah acid peediton ko sikhaati hai ki kaise apane chehre ko cover karnaa he
 Around 55 acid-afflicted girls and women in the country are associated with Riya, whose age ranges from 6 months to 65 years
 kis tarah riya kii team karti he kamacid peediton se jude kaam ko dekhne ke liye riya kii 5 sadasyon kii ek kor team he
 They also have volunteers in different parts of the country, who help them in this work
 riya or unki team human rhite lau network ke saath kaam karti hai
 This network has its own lawyers throughout the country
 jahaan par acid peediton ke apane vakil nahin hote vahaan riya or unki team un peediton ko vakil uplabdh karaati hai
 Apart from this, they have 2 to 3 lawyers who advise them in legal matters
 kis tarah kii dikkaton kaa saamana karnaa padataa hairaahat pahunchane vaale is kaam main sabase badi pareshaanicort ke faislonmen hone vaali deree hoti he
 Due to this, the victim does not get compensation and her rights on time
 iske chalate peeditaaon main niraashaa paidaa hoti he
 Riya says that despite getting so much success, many people do not take them seriously and say that their work will not last long
 iske baavjood riya apane is kaam ko apana junun maanati hai
 So it was Riya who is working as a cold ointment for girls and women who are suffering from acid burning pain

 Rahul Gandhi has now given the formula of '3K' to reverse the political fate of the Congress, which is tasting successive succession
 ajtak ke sutron ke mutabik rahul gandhi kii ye pahal party main kaamkaaj ke tareeke ko badalane kii kavayad kaa hissaa he
 3K stands for Worker, Program and Office
 kaaryakartaaon ko mili sammanupi main mili karaari shikast ke baad rahul gandhi lagaataar party netaaon or kaaryakartaaon se baithken kar rahe hai
 He has given this mantra after the input from these meetings
 congress upaadhyaksh ne nirdesh diya he ki kaaryakartaaon kaa sammaan ho or unki baat suni jaae
 Rahul wants the workers to get work in the party so that they feel their importance
 upie 2 ke dauraan congress kaaryakarta aksar shikaayat karte the ki netaa or mantri unki nahin sunate
 Work on Rahul's mantra has also started
 emsidi chunaav main kai rajyon ke kaaryakarta party ke liye prachaar kar rahe hai
 Win from the program Another important aspect of Dilrahul's formula is the party's program
 rahul jaanate hai ki janata ke liye aise kaarykram chalaae jaaen jinka janata se sidhaa sarokaar ho
 In Rahul's opinion, instead of imposing his program on the people, leaders should try to raise the pulse of the public and raise issues related to them
 sutron ke mutabik rahul ko ye baat note bandi ke baad samaj ai
 He opposed the move from road to parliament
 lekin janata is muhim ke saath nahin judi
 The third aspect of Jorrahul Gandhi's mantra on the importance of office is office
 lagaataar haar ke baad desh bhar main congressi daftaron par niraashaa ke badal chhaae hai
 This is also affecting the functioning of the party
 rahul chaahate hai ki party ke padaadhikari naa sirf karyaalay main baithen balki kaaryakartaaon ko bhi bharpoor vakt den
 Apart from this, such offices should be opened in new places with facilities for the general public along with the workers
 karo yaa maro ke halaataraahul gandhi ko is baat kaa aihsaas he ki party ke saath apni siyaasi jameen bachaane ke liye unhen party ko majboot karnaa hoga
 Bringing party leaders on the air so far is a big challenge for Rahul
 iske saath hi nae netaaon ko party se jodna bhi unki praathamikta he
 But will his plan change in reality, this is a big question

 But in the meantime, the twist came that Kinaramandi had not reached the wedding
 naira mandir kyon nahin pahunchi, isse judi chaunkaane vaali khabar saamne ai he, jisane darshakon ko hilaa kar rakh diya
 Naira's inability to reach Mandir to marry Karthik is due to a brain tumor

 Seats distribution is worse than indo-pak sharing - Sanjay Raut wants to contest more seats than both parties
 The Maharashtra assembly election has been sounded, but the seat sharing between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Shiv Sena has not been done
 
 donon partiyaan zyada se zyada siton par chunaav ladanaa chaahati he, lihaaja seat bantwaare par abtak sahmati nahin ho pai he
 Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut, while expressing the problems related to the seat sharing, said that this partition is even more terrible than the partition of India and Pakistan
 shivasena netaa sanjay raut ne kaha, "itnaa bada maharashtra he ye jo 288 siton kaa bantwaaraa he ye bharat pakistan ke bantwaare se bhi bhayankar he
 "sanjay Raut said that if we were in opposition instead of being in government then the picture would have been different
 unhone kaha ki siton ke bantwaare par jo bhi faisla hoga, use turant media ko bataaya jayega
 Sanjay Raut, Shiv Sena: Itna bada Maharashtra hai, ye jo 288 seats ka bantwara hai ye bharat-pakistan ke bantware se bhi bhayankar hai

 Whatever we decide on seats we'll let you know

 Let me tell you that BJP currently has 122 seats in the 288-member Maharashtra Assembly, while the Shiv Sena has 63 seats
 maharashtra bijepi donon dalon ke bich seat bantwaare ke aise sutara par samjhauta chaahati he, jisapar bhaajapa ke paas 122 siten bani rahen or shivasena par uske hisse kii 63 siten rahen
 And after giving some of the remaining seats to smaller coalition parties like Republican Party of India, they should be divided equally
 shivasena kii mahatvakanksha se itar bijepi zyada se zyada siton par khud chunaav ladanaa chaahati he
 Actually the BJP does not want to end its decisive role in the state under any circumstances
 isi vajah se seat bantwaare ko lekar donon dalon main pech fansaa hua he
 Even before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, there was a dispute over seat sharing between BJP and Shiv Sena
 is vajah se donon dalon ke bich gathbandhan main bhi deree hui thi
 On May 26, Narendra Damodardas Modi completed four years as a 'pradhan Sevak' - as he says for himself

 Odisha was one of the few states where the Modi wave did not show much effect in the 2014 general elections

 The day he could stay in Delhi and talk about the government, he decided to play Ranbheri from the state where the party is weak
 ve jaanate hai ki 2019 main uttar bharat ke apane garh main party kii sambhavit nuksaan kii bharpai aise rajyon se zyada siten laakar kerani hogi
 Those who understand Modi well and those who have worked with him say that his sense of working as the head of the world's largest democracy has made him more impatient than ever to confirm the results
 ve naakaamiyon se samjhauta karne ko taiyaar nahin hote
 There is a need to take seriously what they have said because they believe in following what they say and think
 ve karmyogi hai
 They do not think much about the immediate consequences of what they undertake to do

 The fourth year of his tenure was a tumultuous year for Rajiv Gandhi, who became Prime Minister by an overwhelming majority of 404 seats in the 1984 general elections
 boforce ghotaale ne unki image ko palitha lagaaya tha

 After that, there was a series of coalition governments

 Vajpayee got a third time, by then his government was able to complete the term of five years (1999-2004)
 kaarykaal ke chauthe saal main bhaajapa ne rajasthan, madhya pradesh or chhattisgarh jeeta
 The economy was booming
 saare sanket ishaara kar rahe the ki vaajapeyi chunaav jitkar ek baar phir se pradhanmantri banenge
 Riding on the promotional chariot of 'india Shining', Vajpayee found the opportunity favorable in every way, so he got elections six months ago
 par bhaajapa gramin kshetron ke asantosh or alpsankhyakon kii bechaini sahi tareeke se bhaanpane main naakaam rahi thi
 The RSS saw individuals and development in Vajpayee, but the ideology seemed absent
 vaajapeyi haar gaye
 The UPA came to power under the leadership of the Congress
 manmohan sin ha pradhanmantri bane
 In the fourth year of his first term, Manmohan took a number of important steps, targeting power for the second time in 2009
 unhone khud ko gramin janata kaa sachcha hitaishi sabit karne kii koshish kii or rashtriya gramin rojgaar guarantee yojana (enaraijies) lekar aae
 He won the heart of the middle class by keeping inflation under control, maintaining the pace of economic development and securing a trust in the House on the indo-us nuclear deal
 kai kshetreey partiyon kaa ubhaar hua jiske kaaran vibhinn rajyon main congress ke mukaable bhaajapa ke voton main zyada send lagi
 In contrast, Manmohan's all-round accusations of corruption in the fourth year of his second innings, the inability to formulate policy and the rapid rise of Narendra Modi as a strong alternative were some of the reasons that overshadowed his government
 modi jab may 2014 main satta par kabiz hue to shuruyaat main unhen aise pradhanmantri ke rup main dekha gaya jo doordarshee bhale hi kam hon lekin kisi kaam ko teji se nibatane ko aatur rahete hai
 He began to make a number of populist announcements with josho-kharosh
 andhadhundh yojanaon kii ghoshnaa kii pareshaaniyaan samajhane main unhen kuch vakt laga
 For some time with the big business houses, he kept on spreading the pangs of love but soon he came to understand that the urban rich class is not a big vote bank
 ab unhone indira gandhi kii kitaab ke panne palate or khud ko garibon ke maseehaa ke rup main pesh karnaa shuru kar diya
 He focused on providing the basic necessities of life to the people, about which he is right that various governments in the six decades after independence have consistently ignored the basic needs of the people
 garib or gramin janata ko dhyaan main rakhkar unhone har ghar main shauchalay kii vyavastha karne ke uddeshy se swasth bharat abhiyaan kii shuruyaat kii
 The Saubhagya scheme to illuminate the village houses with electricity, the Muktras gas connection as well as the first cylinder free Ujjwala scheme, the Indira Awas Yojana for cheap homes and the construction of roads connecting the rural areas
 unhone enaraijies kaa or vistaar kiya lekin is baat par focus rahaa ki is yojana ke tahat jo kaam hon ve logon ke apane hi samudaay se jude vikaas kaary hon
 With the trinity of Jan Dhan Yojana, Direct Benefit Transfer and Mobile Connectivity, the Modi government ensured that the money reaches the rightful holders
 isse bhrashtachar par ankush laga or vikaas ke liye bheje jane vaale fund kii hera-pheri main kaaphi had tak roak lagi
 Modi has been successful to a great extent in building his image as a militant leader for social upliftment 
 ve ab brands modi ban chuke hai
 On the economic front, the Modi government's record is mixed
 antarrashtriya bazaar main tel kii keemton main giravat ai thi or nai sarkaar kii chhavi kaam karne kii ichhashakti rakhane vaali sarkaar kii thi
 The economy was recovering from the slowdown in upa-2's tenure and it had caught the pace of development
 lekin ek ke baad ek lagaataar sookhe kaa saamana karne ke kaaran krishi kshetra post ho gaya or kisaanon kii sthiti dayaneey ho chuki thi
 The public wasted about the government, big businessmen also understood that Modi is just a big reformer whose talk is very big but the work is simple
 isse vichlit hue bagaiyr modi ne aarthik sudhaar kii disha main notebandi or jiesti jaise do saahasik faisle liye
 There is still a fair assessment of what the country has achieved on the economic front from demonetisation, but this has made Modi's image of a leader who struggles strongly against corruption
 haalanki isse bhaajapa kaa mukhya matadaata vyapaaree varg hi sabase zyada prabhavit hua
 There are still many problems regarding the implementation of GST, yet there is no doubt that this is the biggest effort to improve indirect tax in recent years, which will have an impact on the economy when all its bonds are opened
 Will go unki sarkaar ne saarvajanik kshetron ke bainkon ko viraasat main mili duubat khaaton (enpie) ke pahaad jaisi chunautiyon se mukti dilaane kii disha main bhi prayaas kiye hai
 After initially showing sluggishness towards agricultural reforms, he tried to provide some relief to farmers by increasing the crop insurance scheme and the support price of crops
 phir bhi, krishi kshetra ko bachaane ke liye abhi bahut kuch kiye jane kii jarurat he
 There has been serious debate on the method of compilation and interpretation of data related to employment and wages, and how the progress towards creation of new employment opportunities got confused in the same debate
 enpie ke daldal main dhanse bainkon ko baahar nikaal laana ab bhi ek badi chunauti to he hi, nijee nivesh ko aakarshith karnaa or desh ke dhan ko baahar chale jane se bhi rokna hoga
 The recent rise in oil prices poses new challenges

 The Modi government has been embarrassed about how people like Nirav Modi and Vijay Mallya got the opportunity to leave the country easily, but there is no major scam in this government that goes to Modi
 agar modi apane is kaarykaal ke antim saal main jidipi kii vikaas dar ko upar kii ore le jane main sakasham hote hai tabhi ve 2019 ke chunaavon ke liye janata se vot maangate hue yah daawa kar sakenge ki ve arthvyavastha ko vikaas kii patari par sarapat daudane main safal rahe hai
 Modi has truly excelled in his foreign policy
 pradhanmantri banane se pehle centre main kaam karne kaa purv kaa koi anubhav nahin hone ke baavjood, ve khud ko swaabhaavik darshane main safal rahe hai
 He wanted to come out of the shadows of the past and in an environment of global instability, he always tried to go ahead and strengthen his grip
 ‘padosi sabase pehle’ kii unki niti kaa, khaastaur se pakistan, nepal or china ke lihaaj se, shuruaati anubhav bahut kadava rahaa lekin ab sab dhire-dhire patari par lautataa dikh rahaa he
 There have been two reasons behind his efforts to warm up relations with West Asian and Central Asian countries
 bharat kii tel kii jaruratein puri karnaa saath-saath muslim deshon main pakistan kii pakad ko dhili karnaa
 His efforts have started to pay off
 unhone america, rus, japan yaa europe jaisi badi takaton ke saath mail-jol badhaakar khaastaur se vyapaar or samrik muddon par bhartiya hiton ko saadhane kaa prayaas kiya he
 At the international level, he appears to be standing with his own unique policy of India, which can be called an official 'policy of non-alignment by strengthening the relationship with each faction'
 modi kii safalataa hi unki ek sabase badi kami bhi he
 They want to remain a 'one-man army'
 do morchon par unki sarkaar pichad jaati he: saamaajik kshetra main sudhaar ke prayaason kaa abhaav or alpsankhyakon ke man main panapati us bhaavana ko jisase ve khud ko alag-thalag mahasoos karne lage hai, badalane kii koshish kii kami
 His ministers seem very sluggish in the direction of improving education and health
 bas is saal ke bajet main sarkaar ne bharat ke garibon or madhya varg ko swasthya sevaaon ke kharch ke boj se raahat dene ke liye ek prayaas kiya he jise vah duniya kii sabase badi swasthya beemaa yojana ke rup main prachaarit kar rahi he
 Reforms in higher education have gone far behind the priority list of the government
 baat alpsankhyakon, khaskar musalamaanon se jude hiton kii ho tab modi sarkaar or bhaajapa kii chhavi dhundhlee or bhedbhaav se bhari najar aati he
 Perhaps both the government and the party do not want to repeat that mistake of Vajpayee compromising with the ideology of the Sangh
 aisi chhavi ban gai he ki pradhanmantri daliton or musalamaanon ke khilaaf hone vaale atyaacharon kii ghatnaon par sakht ravaiya nahin apanaate
 Yet there is a general perception that the Prime Minister is a very hardworking, honest and dedicated person who has done well on many fronts
 unki yah chhavi bhaajapa ke 2019 ke nae naare: ‘saaf niyat, sahi vikaas’ par sateek baithti he
 In Gujarat, where he ruled for 13 years and his performance there, it can be said that even as Prime Minister, he is a marathon runner of the long race

 The marathon race for women was first started at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics
 tab america dhaavak jon benoet samulsan ne 26
 Some rules were made to win the 2 mile race, Modi is probably following them

 You control only your race, not someone else's race

 Samuelson's second rule was: "keep trying, keeping an eye on the target
" res tab tak khatm nahin hogi jab tak aap finnish line nahin chhu letin
 "modi understands this
" unki shuru kii hui badi yojanaayen antim kshanon main mukaam tak pahunchen, yah pakkaa karnaa hoga
 Samuelsson's third principle was: "never give up
 majbootee se jame rahen
 Trust yourself, your training and your heart
 yah apaar jansamooh aapako finnish line tak lekar jayega
 "modi's ability to keep his feet firmly on his feet, which also has immense public support, puts him far ahead of the opposition and closer to the target in the 2019 race

 Nitish said that Prime Minister Modi has raised the issue of electricity, so elections should be held on this
 modi jab bijli ke mudde par bol rahe the to unhen janata se koi rispons nahin mila kyonki logon ko pataa he ki vah jo bol rahe hai sahi nahin hai
 In 2013, the Government of Bihar reached an agreement with GAIL and development work was done under that
 he
 The schemes that Modi has laid the foundation of are old
 'modi ne mere sawaalon kaa jawaab nahin diya'bihar ke siemne kaha, 'piem ne raily main mere twit kaa zikr to kiya lekin un muddon par koi baat nahin kii to saat mudde hamane uthaae the or na hi unhone gas vitaran ke us mudde par chuppi todi jise maine patna ke ek sarkari kaarykram main uthaaya tha
 Not only this, Nitish said that Modi neither responded to the issues related to the railways nor said anything on the state government's questions
 nitish ne dikhaaya videonithish ne bijli par 2012 main kiye apane vaade kaa video dikhaate huepradhanmantri par bhi sawaluthae or kaha ki unhone kabhi nahin kaha tha ki ghar-ghar bijli nahin panhuchi to vot nahin maangenge
 CM asked why Modi compares himself to the previous Prime Minister
 bijli ke kshetra main bihar main pehle se kaaphi kaam hua he or centre kii yojanaon main rajya kaa 40 fisadi kaa yogadan hota he
 The invitation to BJP to form the government has emerged as the largest political party after the Karnataka Assembly elections has become a matter of controversy
 khaskar tab jabaki bijepi vidhansabha main floor test kaa saamana bhi nahin kar saki or usase pehle hi mukhyamantri bi es yediurppa ne istipha de diya
 Karnataka Governor Vajubhai Vala is at the center of this controversy and questions have arisen at his discretion and dignity of the post of Governor
 ab jabaki yediurppa kaa istipha ho gaya he to ek sawaal ye bhi uth rahaa he ki vajubhai vaala apni chook sweekaar karte hue pad se istipha denge?karnataka main vidhansabha chunaavon main voton kii ginati jari thi
 The BJP was emerging as the largest party in the trends
 isse pehle ki rujhaan nateezon main badalte congress or jedies ne gathbandhan kaa daanv chalate hue elaan kar diya ki jedies netaa echdi kumaraswami ke netritv main karnataka kii nai sarkaar kaa gathan kiya jayega or congress bina kisi shart ke is sarkaar ko samarthan degi
 The arithmetic of the election results was completely in favor of this alliance
 bijepi ke 104 vidhayakon ke jawaab main congress ke 78 or jedies ke 37 vidhayakon kaa gathjod 221 sadasyon kii vidhansabha main bahumat ke liye kaaphi tha
 But Vajubhai Vala, sitting in the role of Governor of the state with the oath of constitution, did not understand this arithmetic
 sambhavat: kendra main baithi bijepi sarkaar kaa dabaav vajubhai vaala ko yah ganit samajhane nahin de rahaa tha
 Just as it was important for the BJP to make Karnataka free from Congress, the challenge before Governor Vajubhai Vala was to form a BJP government in Karnataka
 is chunauti ke aage rajyapal ne na sirf congress or jedies ke nae chune hue vidhayakon ke dal ko nazarandaaj kiya, balki sabase bade dal ke taur par ubhari bijepi ke netaa bies yediurppa ke sarkaar banane ke daawey ko sahi maanate hue use turant sarkaar banane ke liye nimantran de diya
 Not only this, usually in the event of no party having a clear majority, the Governor gives time to prove the majority to the new government in 7 days
 lekin vaala ne yediurppa ko 15 din kaa samay diya
 Meanwhile, the Congress and the JDS had knocked on the door of the Supreme Court, but not taking cognizance of this, the Governor swore the Yeddyurappa government of BJP as soon as he got the first opportunity
 gauratlab he ki bhartiya samvidhan main rajyapal ke pad ko shaamil karne ke liye british sarkaar ke samay government of india act 1935 main governor ke praavdhaan ko aadhaar banaaya gaya
 However, this provision was made in the British Government Act so that the governor could be used to control the provincial government formed after democratic elections in the British provinces in slave India
 lekin aazaadee ke baad desh ke samvidhan main is pad ko jari isliye rakhaa gaya jisase desh ke rajyon ko samvidhan ke anuroop chalaane main rajyapal desh ke raashtrapati kii aankh or kaan ban saken
 But over time, this post continued to be politically misused and the role of the governor developed as an agent of the central government
 ek baar phir karnataka main chunaav ke baad chale naatak se yah saaf ho chukaa he ki rajyapal ne samvidhan se mili apane kartavyon ko raajnneeti se pare rakhane main vifaltaa kaa parichay diya he
 Will the Governor in Karnataka resign from his post? Will the resignation of Governor Vajubhai Vala in the state of Karnataka only solve this problem or is there a need to think afresh whether the country needs a governor in the states
 yadi chunaav ke baad nai sarkaar ke gathan main rajyapal kii aisi bhoomika sambhav he to kya is baat kii guarantee he ki nai sarkaar ke gathan ke baad rajyapal nai sarkaar ko swatantra taur par kaam karne degaa? khud congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi se jab ye sawaal kiya gaya tab unka bhi yahi jawaab tha ki rajyapal ko badla janaa chahie lekin jis nae shaks kii is pad par niyukti hogi wo bhi yahi nahin karenge isaki koi guarantee nahinhai

 yadi aap purvi dilli main rahete hai or shaadi samaaroh ke liye emsidi ke baratghar yani community centre book karaane kii soch rahe hai to ab jeb main rupee zyada rakhie
 Indeed, East MCD has increased the booking charge of its community buildings
 ye badhotaree sabhi category ke saamudayik bhawanon ke liye kii gai he
 Let us tell you that a few months ago there was a huge increase in the booking charge of community buildings, but now the increase has been reduced and the new rates have been passed by the standing committee of eastmcd
 pehle a category ke saamudayik bhawanon kaa booking charge jahaan 15 hazaar tha use badhaakar ab 20 hazaar rupee kar diya gaya he
 Whereas, the booking charge of community buildings of b category has been increased from Rs 7,500 to Rs 10,000
 vahiin c category ke saamudayik bhawanon ke liye abhi jahaan 4 hazaar 500 rupee booking charge ke taur par dene hote hai uske liye ab 6 hazaar rupee dene honge
 Whereas for d category, now you have to pay 3 thousand rupees instead of 2 thousand 250 rupees
 yahi nahin e category ke liye bhi ab 750 rupee kii jagah 1250 rupee jamaa karaane honge
 Apart from this, East MCD has also decided to give 10 community buildings in private hands which have maximum bookings
 haalanki ye sabhi saamudayik bhawan sirf a category ke hi hai
 This decision of the corporation has been opposed by the opposition
 vipakshi parshadonke saath sattarudh bijepi ke bhi parshad is faisle se khush nahin he
 Councilors of the ruling and opposition say that the community buildings of the MCD have been built for the poor and the lower classes, so that they can do the programs at a lower cost
 lekin nigam ke is faisle se saamudayik bhawanon kii booking mushkil ho jaaegi

 When the terrorists attacked the bus which started on Amarnath Yatra and started firing indiscriminately, the bus driver gave a great display of restraint and drove the bus forward without fear
 bas ke driver kaa naam shaikh saleem gafoor bhai he
 He is being praised for driving the bus forward between the bullets
 jammu kashmir ke anantnag main aatanki hamale ke baad jab saleem ke chachere bhai javed mirza ne baat kii tab unhone bataaya ki jab aatankiyon ne goli chalaanaa shuru kar diya tab unhone bas roki nahin or tab tak aage bas chalaate le gaye jab tak sabhi tirthayatri surakshit na ho jaaen
 Seven pilgrims were killed and 20 others were injured in the attack

 He saved our lives

 unhone bataaya ki aatankiyon ne pehle ek police kii car par hamalaa kiya tha or phir ek sicurity chack post par goliyaan daagi thim
 After that those terrorists targeted the bus
 police kaa kahana he ki paanch baje ke baad bas ko sadak par nahin chalanaa chahie tha
 It is now being said that the bus is running two hours late due to tire puncture
 bhagya mani jinhone is aatanki hamale main apni bhabhi ko kho diya tab unhone kaha ki driver bas ko ek kilometre dur tak le gaya
 At that time it was very dark and we could not see anything
 raat kareeb 9
 After the terror attack at 30 pm, Salim informed his cousin about the whole incident over phone
 javed ne bataaya ki saleem ne kaha - use afsos he ki vah saat logon ko nahin bachaa paaya, lekin garv he ki vah 50 logon ko surakshit le ja sakaa
 After the terrorist attack in Anantnag in Jammu and Kashmir, when Salim's cousin Javed Mirza spoke, he said that when the terrorists started firing, they did not stop and then drove the bus until all the pilgrims were safe
 Let it happen
 is hamale main saat tirthayatriyon kii maut ho gai or 20 anya ghayal ho gaye
 Those who survived in this attack say that if Salim stopped the bus, many more people lost their lives
 anantnag ke aspataal main ek ghayal ne kaha ki teen ore se lagaataar firing ho rahi thi
 Our driver took the bus further a few kilometers
 usne hamaari jaan bachaai
 The comments police ne enditivi ko bataaya ki hamalavar lashkar e taiyab ke aatanki thi
 He said that the terrorists first attacked a police car and then fired at a security check post
 iske baad un aatankiyon ne bas ko nishaanaa banaaya tha
 Police say the bus should not have walked on the road after five o'clock
 ab kaha ja rahaa he ki tair panchar ho jane ke kaaran bas apane samay se do ghante deree se chal rahi he
 Bhagya Mani who lost his sister-in-law in this terror attack then said that the driver took the bus to a kilometer away
 us samay ghor andhera tha or ham kuch dekh nahin paa rahe the
 Around 9 pm
 30 baje aatanki hamale ke baad saleem ne apane chachere bhai ko phone par sari ghatana kii jaankaree di
 Javed said that Salim said - he regrets that he could not save seven people, but is proud that he could take 50 people safely
 is hamale main jin logon kii jaan batch gai unka kahana he ki agar saleem bas ko roak dete to kai or ko apni jaan se haath dhonaa padaa

 kai darshakon ne is baat kii ore ishaara kiya he ki france par hamale ke baad vahaan kii media kaa kawarej dekhie
 Blood-soaked photographs of the scene were not shown
 ek bhi shav kaa video nahin dikhaa
 Neither the anchor was screaming nor the reporter was jumping
 studio main vaktaa sanyamit swar main bol rahe the or raajnneetik dal sarkaar or khufia agency par hamalaa bolne kii jagah sarkaar ke saath khadey nazar aae
 You audience has raised legitimate questions
 janvari main jab france main hi sharli abdo par hamalaa hua or 17 log maare gaye tab bhi vahaan kii media or khaskar samaaj kaa sanyam gazab tareeke se saamne aayaa
 Everyone was cautious about not doing such a thing, which unnecessarily hurt a community
 french samaaj or media dekh paa rahaa tha ki yah kuch logon kii khooni karatuut he
 It does not have social, religious recognition
 bharat main aisa nahin hota he
 Political spokespersons, experts, news anchors shout a lot and at the same time prove the Prime Minister as a negation
 yahi sawaal aap khud se bhi puuchhie
 Why do you watch such channels whose anchors shout
 jinaki braking news vaali pattee se aag ke sholay nikalate hai
 This does not mean that your question about Indian media is wrong
 dukh he ki itani si baat aapako sienen or bibisi dekhne ke baad pataa chali
 Do not vote on the restraint of the language of the mainstream media
 us raajnneeti par jaaie, jo aatank ke peeche kii sazishon ko aasaani se kaaleen ke neeche sarka detaa he
 For example, the news of terrorist attacks in Ankara and Beirut was not given prominence
 har aatanki hamale ke baad duniya ekajute hone kaa sankalp karti he
 The consumption of CCTV cameras increases and the recruitment of some spies is eliminated
 iske baad sab apane-apane kaam main lag jate hai or aatank phir se kahin aa dhamkata he
 Recall this year, a picture of September 1 rocked the whole world, especially Europe
 samandar ke kinare teen saal ke bachche islan kaa ek shav padaa tha
 While fleeing Syria to Greece, the boat capsized near Turkey and everything is finished
 is tasviir ne sharnaarthi kii samasya ko lekar puure europe main sansani paidaa kar di
 Europe was accused of not being sensitive to refugees
 france ne kaha tha ki europe ko apaat str par is samasya ke prati kadam uthaane honge
 There were debates in France, Germany, Poland, Britain
 syria se bhaagane vaale sharnaarthiyon ko sharan di jaae yaa nahin
 Syria has been at war for four years
 vahaan anginat log maare gaye or ghayal hue hai
 Millions of people started fleeing due to war
 unheen deshon main jinaki sena unke gharon par bam barasaa rahi he
 Now a voice is being raised against those refugees
 hamaari bhavukta badal chuki he
 Germany, which has been more liberal, will be under increasing pressure to seal its border
 chancelar angela markel jo sharnaarthiyon ko lekar udaar thi, ab sankat main pad sakati hai
 Poland started saying from now that it would no longer allow refugees to come to their land without guaranteeing security
 france ne hamale kaa badla lene ke liye islamic state ke garh maane jane vaale rakka par hawaii hamalaa bol diya
 In September also, the French army attacked Syria
 har hamale main training camp or kuch thikaanon par hamalaa karne kaa daawa kiya jaataa he
 The President of France then said that whenever there is a threat to our country, we will carry out air strikes
 kaise hota he ki alqaida khatm hota he to ISIS aa jaataa he
 ISIS was born from the lap of religion or the thinking of some countries, but Islam is its outer face
 daawey kiye gaye hai ki syria kii baagi sena ke log isamen gaye hai
 Saddam Hussein's remaining army men have strengthened its base
 america or siie kaa bhi naam aata he
 Now the question is whether it can be fought without knowing who created ISIS
 iske paas hathiyaar or dhan kahaan se aa rahaa he
 On November 14, in connection with the election debate, Democrat leader Bernie Sanders said that the US invasion of Iraq in 2003 was the biggest lapse of its foreign policy
 sanders ne kaha he ki iraq hamale kii garbh se hi alqaida or ISIS kaa janm hua he
 Was it such a minor mistake to save it by calling it a country or a state
 hillari clinton ne kaha ki ISIS kaa prasar internet ke kaaran ho rahaa he
 Isn't this a mild answer
 galati america kii thi to ab hillari clinton kyon kah rahi hai ki yah sirf america kii ladaai nahin he
 On 25 October, former British Prime Minister Tony Blair also admitted that it was a big mistake to support the US attack on Iraq
 islamic state ke ubhaar ke peeche yah bhi ek vajah he
 Terrorism is fighting us
 ham usase nahin lard paa rahe hai
 Along with attacking terrorist targets from the aircraft, the world should be told who created the Taliban
 alqaida ke peeche koun tha or ISIS ke peeche koun he
 How ISIS emerges within a year and becomes a threat to the whole world
 yaheen par pradhanmantri narendra modi kii baat laana chahta hum
 He has been saying in his many visits that terrorism needs to be defined
 pradhanmantri modi ne sanyukt raashtra ke 70 saal hone ke maukey par kaha tha ki hamen or samay barbaad nahin karnaa chahie
 So that we know who is with terrorism and who is against
 pradhanmantri ne ye baat apane har daure par doharaai he
 The secretary-general of the United Nations has awakened after the Paris attack, saying that he will present a comprehensive plan to stop terrorism
 abhi tak sanyukt raashtra kya kar rahaa tha
 The secretary-general of the United Nations has called for a summit on terrorism
 kya pashchimi mulk in sawaalon se takaraane kaa saahas dikhaa paaenge ki ISIS ko kisne paidaa kiya
 The question of Islam also has to be openly confronted
 islam kaa wahabi cheharaa agar kaaran he or khatarnaak he to us par bhi baat honi hi chahie
 The comments kai jaankaar likhte hai ki saudi arab wahabi islam kaa prasar kar rahaa he, jiske asar main islam ke naam par aatmghaatee naujavaanon kii khep nikal rahi he
 Europe has to look within itself to see what is the reason that its fighters are going to jump into the war of Syria
 shanivaar ko saudi arab ke videsh mantri ne kaha he ki jab tak syria ke raashtrapati asad ko hataaya nahin jaataa tab tak vah syria ke vidrohiyon kii madad karata rahegaa
 Guardian newspaper has reported that Saudi Arabia will spend millions of dollars in training rebels
 free sirian army baagi gut he, jise america ne khub hathiyaar die
 a large part of this has been merged into the Islamic State
 rus syria ke raashtrapati asad kaa samarthan karata he
 Now there is debate on who is the rebel in Syria and who is the terrorist and there will be another attack
 paris ke hamale ke kai ghante ho gaye hai
 There have been raids in many places
 france main rocket launture or kalashnicove kii baramadagi hui he
 Many people have been arrested in Belgium
 ISIS se ladane ke naam par chand hamale kya aapako aashwast karte hai ki pashchimi desh aatankwaad se ladane ke liye vaaki gambhir hai
 Terrorism is a threat or business for arms dealers
 aap darshakon ne vaazib sawaal uthaae hai
 In January, when the Charley Abdo attack in France and 17 people were killed, the media and especially the restraint of the society came out in awe
 har koi is baat ko lekar satark tha ki aisi baat na karen, jisase kisi samudaay ko bevajaah thes pahunche
 French society and media were able to see that this is the bloody act of some people
 ise saamaajik, dharmik manyata hasil nahin he
 This does not happen in India
 raajnneetik pravaktaa, export, news ankar khub cheekhte-chillaate hai or usee vakt pradhanmantri ko nakaara sabit kar dete hai
 Ask the same question to yourself
 aap kyon aise channelon ko dekhte hai jinke ankar cheekhte-chillaate hai
 Whose breaking news comes out of the strip of fire
 iskaa matlab yah nahin ki bhartiya media ko lekar aapkaa sawaal galat he
 Sad to know so much after watching CNN and BBC
 vaise vahaan kii mukhyadhara kii media kii bhashaa ke sanyam par mat jaaie
 Go to the politics that easily shoves the plot behind terror under the carpet
 jaise ankara or bayrut main hue aatanki hamale kii khabaron ko pramukhataa nahin di gai
 The world resolves to unite after every terrorist attack
 sisitivi camaron kii khapat bad jaati he or or kuch jasuson kii bhartee nikal jaati he
 After this, everyone gets involved in their work and the terror comes again
 yaad kiijie isi saal ek sitambar kii ek tasviir ne puri duniya khaskar europe ko jhakzor diya tha
 a corpse of a three-year-old boy, Ailan, was lying on the shore
 siria se greece bhaagate vakt turki ke paas naav palat gai or sab kuch khatm ho gaya he
 The picture created a sensation across Europe over the refugee problem
 europe par aarope laga ki wo sharnaarthiyon ke prati samvedansheel nahin he
 France had said that Europe would have to take steps towards this problem at an emergency level
 france, germany, poland, britain main bahes hone lagi
 Whether to give refuge to refugees fleeing Syria
 chaar saal se syria yuddh grast he
 Countless people have been killed and injured there
 yuddh se aajeez aakar lakhon log palaayan karne lage
 In the same countries whose army is bombing their homes
 ab unheen sharnaarthiyon ke khilaaf awaz uthne lagi he
 Our feelings have changed
 germany jo zyaada udaar rahaa he us par apni seemaa ko sil karne kaa dabaav badhegaa
 Chancellor Angela Merkel, who was liberal about refugees, may now be in trouble
 poland abhi se kehane laga ki bina suraksha kii guarantee ke wo ab sharnaarthi ko apni zamin par nahin aane degaa
 France retaliated with an aerial attack on Raqqa, considered a stronghold of the Islamic State
 sitambar maheene main bhi france kii sena ne syria par hamalaa bolaa tha
 Each attack claims to have attacked a training camp and some targets
 france ke raashtrapati ne tab kaha tha ki jab bhi hamaare mulk ko khatra hoga ham hawaii hamale karenge
 How is it that ISIS comes to an end when Al Qaeda is over
 ISIS dharm kii god se paidaa hua yaa kuch mulkon kii soch se magar islam iskaa bahari cheharaa to he hi
 There have been claims that Syrian rebel forces have gone to it
 saddaam hossain kii bachi khuchi sena ke logon ne iske aadhaar ko majboot kiya he
 The name of America and CIA also comes
 ab sawaal he ki kya yah jane bagaiyr ki ISIS ko kisne paidaa kiya, usase ladaa ja saktaa he
 Where is the weapon and money coming from it

 a corpse of a three-year-old boy, Ailan, was lying on the shore

 The picture created a sensation across Europe over the refugee problem

 Recall this year, a picture of September 1 rocked the whole world, especially Europe
 samandar ke kinare teen saal ke bachche islan kaa ek shav padaa tha
 While fleeing Syria to Greece, the boat capsized near Turkey and everything is finished
 is tasviir ne sharnaarthi kii samasya ko lekar puure europe main sansani paidaa kar di
 Europe was accused of not being sensitive to refugees
 france ne kaha tha ki europe ko apaat str par is samasya ke prati kadam uthaane honge
 There were debates in France, Germany, Poland, Britain
 syria se bhaagane vaale sharnaarthiyon ko sharan di jaae yaa nahin
 Syria has been at war for four years
 vahaan anginat log maare gaye or ghayal hue hai
 Millions of people started fleeing due to war
 unheen deshon main jinaki sena unke gharon par bam barasaa rahi he
 Now a voice is being raised against those refugees
 hamaari bhavukta badal chuki he
 Germany, which has been more liberal, will be under increasing pressure to seal its border
 chancelar angela markel jo sharnaarthiyon ko lekar udaar thi, ab sankat main pad sakati hai
 Poland started saying from now that it would no longer allow refugees to come to their land without guaranteeing security
 france ne hamale kaa badla lene ke liye islamic state ke garh maane jane vaale rakka par hawaii hamalaa bol diya
 In September also, the French army attacked Syria
 har hamale main training camp or kuch thikaanon par hamalaa karne kaa daawa kiya jaataa he
 The President of France then said that whenever there is a threat to our country, we will carry out air strikes
 kaise hota he ki alqaida khatm hota he to ISIS aa jaataa he
 ISIS was born from the lap of religion or the thinking of some countries, but Islam is its outer face
 daawey kiye gaye hai ki syria kii baagi sena ke log isamen gaye hai
 Saddam Hussein's remaining army men have strengthened its base
 america or siie kaa bhi naam aata he
 Now the question is whether it can be fought without knowing who created ISIS
 iske paas hathiyaar or dhan kahaan se aa rahaa he
 On November 14, in connection with the election debate, Democrat leader Bernie Sanders said that the US invasion of Iraq in 2003 was the biggest lapse of its foreign policy
 sanders ne kaha he ki iraq hamale kii garbh se hi alqaida or ISIS kaa janm hua he
 Was it such a minor mistake to save it by calling it a country or a state
 hillari clinton ne kaha ki ISIS kaa prasar internet ke kaaran ho rahaa he
 Isn't this a mild answer
 galati america kii thi to ab hillari clinton kyon kah rahi hai ki yah sirf america kii ladaai nahin he
 On 25 October, former British Prime Minister Tony Blair also admitted that it was a big mistake to support the US attack on Iraq
 islamic state ke ubhaar ke peeche yah bhi ek vajah he
 Terrorism is fighting us
 ham usase nahin lard paa rahe hai
 Along with attacking terrorist targets from the aircraft, the world should be told who created the Taliban
 alqaida ke peeche koun tha or ISIS ke peeche koun he
 How ISIS emerges within a year and becomes a threat to the whole world
 yaheen par pradhanmantri narendra modi kii baat laana chahta hum
 He has been saying in his many visits that terrorism needs to be defined
 pradhanmantri modi ne sanyukt raashtra ke 70 saal hone ke maukey par kaha tha ki hamen or samay barbaad nahin karnaa chahie
 So that we know who is with terrorism and who is against
 pradhanmantri ne ye baat apane har daure par doharaai he
 The secretary-general of the United Nations has awakened after the Paris attack, saying that he will present a comprehensive plan to stop terrorism
 abhi tak sanyukt raashtra kya kar rahaa tha
 The secretary-general of the United Nations has called for a summit on terrorism
 kya pashchimi mulk in sawaalon se takaraane kaa saahas dikhaa paaenge ki ISIS ko kisne paidaa kiya
 The question of Islam also has to be openly confronted
 islam kaa wahabi cheharaa agar kaaran he or khatarnaak he to us par bhi baat honi hi chahie
 The comments kai jaankaar likhte hai ki saudi arab wahabi islam kaa prasar kar rahaa he, jiske asar main islam ke naam par aatmghaatee naujavaanon kii khep nikal rahi he
 Europe has to look within itself to see what is the reason that its fighters are going to jump into the war of Syria
 shanivaar ko saudi arab ke videsh mantri ne kaha he ki jab tak syria ke raashtrapati asad ko hataaya nahin jaataa tab tak vah syria ke vidrohiyon kii madad karata rahegaa
 Guardian newspaper has reported that Saudi Arabia will spend millions of dollars in training rebels
 free sirian army baagi gut he, jise america ne khub hathiyaar die
 a large part of this has been merged into the Islamic State
 rus syria ke raashtrapati asad kaa samarthan karata he
 Now there is debate on who is the rebel in Syria and who is the terrorist and there will be another attack
 paris ke hamale ke kai ghante ho gaye hai
 There have been raids in many places
 france main rocket launture or kalashnicove kii baramadagi hui he
 Many people have been arrested in Belgium
 ISIS se ladane ke naam par chand hamale kya aapako aashwast karte hai ki pashchimi desh aatankwaad se ladane ke liye vaaki gambhir hai
 Terrorism is a threat or business for arms dealers
 germany jo zyaada udaar rahaa he us par apni seemaa ko sil karne kaa dabaav badhegaa

 mangalvaar dopaher dilli ke chidyaghar main 22 saal kaa ek noujvaan achaanak safed baagh ke baade main ja girtaa he
 The six-year-old tiger was named Vijay
 ab baade ke andar makasuud or vijay donon aamane-saaman the
 There was no way of saving life
 aise main makasuud bas pehali or aakhri koshish karata he
 He folds both hands in front of the tiger and then keeps adding such hands for five whole minutes
 khauf main lipati bebasii kaa alam dekhie
 The last struggle for life, sitting right in front of death
 pataa he ki baagh insaani jubaan nahin samajhataa, lekin kya pataa haath jodne kaa matlab samaj jaae
 The distance was a few inches
 lihaaja jaan bachaane kaa bas yahi aakhri tarika use soojha or usne baagh ke aage donon haath jod die
 But after five minutes the picture changed
 baagh nahin mana
 He just showed his beastliness
 paanch minute baad baagh usapar jhapatata he
 He snaps his neck and throws him to a place while running
 balance bigadaa yaa jaanboojhkar kuuda makasodaroj kii tarah dilli ke chadiyaghar main saikadon log maujuud the or unheen ke bich maujuud ta dilli ke anand parvat ilaake kaa rahane vaala 22 saal kaa makasuud
 Maqsood, a student of 12th, was near the white tiger fence at that time
 chashmadidon kii maane to baade ke kareeb kuch der tak to makasuud thikthak khadaa tha
 Then suddenly he does not know what happened that he climbed over the fence
 baade ke upar chadhane ke baad shaayad uskaa balance bighad gaya yaa phir chappal phisal gai, jisaki vajah se apana santulan kho baitha or sidhe duusari taraf baagh ke baade main ja gira
 However, according to an employee of the zoo, Maqsood deliberately jumped inside the enclosure
 vajah jo bhi ho
 The tiger was walking inside the fence at that time
 makasuud andar gira, baagh kii najar usapar padi or vah fouran makasuud ke kareeb aa gaya
 Seeing this scene, the people present there screamed out
 baade ke andar baagh ke saamne kisi ke jane kii himmat nahin thi or makasuud ko baagh se bachaane ke liye chidyaghar kaa koi karmchaaree bhi vahaan nahin tha
 Seeing the tiger very close to him, Maqsood's life was now stuck in the circle
 log bhi dam saadhe ye manjar dekh rahe the
 Some were also taking photographs
 paanch minute tak makasuud or baagh donon aamane-saamne baithe rahete hai
 But then the zoo screams everywhere
 paanch minute tak baagh makasuud ko bas ghurta rahata he
 But five minutes later, suddenly a stone tiger senses and gets angry
 ye pathar baade ke baahar khadi bheed ne darasal baagh ko bhagane ke liye maaraa tha
 But the question arises that for five minutes the zoo workers had a chance to save Maqsood, then why he could not save? He was mentally ill
 Maqsoodhar is also coming in that Maqsood was mentally ill and was undergoing treatment
 Had been
 chashmadidon kii maane to pathar lagate hi baagh ko gussa aa gaya or usne usee vakt makasuud par hamalaa kar diya
 The tiger swooped directly on Maqsood's neck and pressed his neck into his neck and started to run around in anger
 is dauraan makasuud ne baagh ke changul se bachane kii tamaam koshish kii, lekin ye koshish mushkil se paanch second kii thi
 After Maqsood's death, the zoo staff ran to the spot and somehow led the tiger to his room
 makasuud kii laash baade se nikaali gai
 When the Maqsood fell inside the enclosure, no security personnel of the zoo were present there
 log khud hi cheekh-pukaar yaa pathar markar baagh ko makasuud se alag karne kii koshish kar rahe the
 However, the zoo has issued a statement saying that a security guard was present near the tiger enclosure
 usee ne makasuud ko baade se dur rakhane kii koshish bhi kii thi
 But later Maqsood climbed over the fence from the other side
 bayaan main ye bhi kaha gaya he ki makasuud ke baade main girte hi alarm bhi bajaayaa gaya tha
 At present, orders have been ordered to investigate the matter
 jaanch report aane ke baad hi pataa chalegaa ki galati kiski thi
 The questions of Maqsood or Zoo? The questions that need answers are no longer among us
 lekin uski maut kai sawaal chhod gai he-jab noujvaan baagh ke baade main had se zyada taank-jhaank kar rahaa tha, to use vahaan maujuud surakshakarmiyon ne rokane kii koshish kyon nahin kii?jab noujvaan andar gira, to surakshakarmiyon ne vahaan maujuud logon ko hataa kar zu prashasan ke bade adhikariyon ko fouran isaki ittila kyon nahin di?ju prashasan ke adhikariyon ne maukey par pahunch kar ladke ko bachaane kii koshish kyon nahin kii?logon ko shor machaane or baagh ko pathar maarane se kyon nahin roka gaya?baagh ko trankulizer dekar behosh kayon nahin kiya gaya?reva se yahaan laae gaye chah saal ke safed baagh ke panje main aakar ab ek shaks kii jaan chali jane ke baad ju prashasan saare kaayade kanoon maanane kii baat kah rahaa he

 swasthya mantri yah rasta pichley 5 maheene se istemaal kar rahe hai
 People have been living in the slum colony for the last several decades
 sthaneey log bataate hai ki achaanak swasthya mantri ke ghar jane ke is raste kii vajah se unhen kaaphi pareshaani ho rahi he
 These people, living since the first Chief Minister of Bihar, Shribabu, do small jobs in the government, but due to the narrow lane of the township, they always fear that children may come under the vehicles
 200 meter kii patali gali jo tej pratap yadav ke ghar tak pahunchati he usamen kareeb 100 parivaar rahata he
 Not only this, the thin lane has been further blocked near Tejapratap's house
 vaise totej pratap yadampane pita or maa lalu prasad yadav or rabari devi ke saath 10 circular road main rahete hai lekin is sarkari awaas main dinabhar unki rajnatik dincharya lagi rahati he
 Tej Pratap has created DSS to challenge the RSS i
e
 the secular Swayam Sevak Sangh
 dses ke kaaryakartaaon kaa is ghar main aana janaa laga rahata he
 This is the real reason, earlier on 3 Deshratna Marg, Water Resources Minister Vijay Chaudhary used to be, but now he is the Speaker of the Assembly
 unhone mukhya dwaar ko nahin band karaayaa
 But Tej Pratap Yadav would think that its entrance is south facing which is considered inauspicious
 shaayad isiilie unhone mukhya sadak se jude is pravesh dwaar ko band kar slam basti kii sankari galiyon se guzarate hue apane sarkari awaas pahunch rahe hai
 What is said Neetu, who lives in the slum settlement, says that she has been living for a long time
 inase koi dikkat nahin he or thik hi he babu aae hai to thik hi he
 Sadhna Devi, on the other hand, says that we cannot tell anything right now, now look forward if we speak, we will see that there is a fear in our mind that we will be removed
 ham harijan jati ke hai baahar kaam karne jate hai baccha kitna der ghar main rahegaa khelnaa band ho gaya he
 Raju Babu said that he has been living since the era of father and grandfather, fearing that our house may be torn apart
 barsaat kaa mausam he ham logon ko baithne uthne main dikkat ho gaya he
 When the car comes, we run into the house
 bacchon ko zyada dikkat he
 The US has banned the Indian-based group Indian Mujahideen (IM) and declared it a foreign terrorist group
 america ne kaha ki iem ke lashkar-e-tayba jaise pakistan aadhaarit guton ke saath sambandh hai
 Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton imposed restrictions on IM
 videsh mantralay ne kaha ki pakistan aadhaarit lashkar, jaish-e-mohammad or harakat-uli-jihad-e-islamic (huji) jaise videshi aatankwaadi sanghathan ghoshit kiye duusare sanghathanon ke saath iem ke sampark hai
 It added that IM aims to carry out terrorist activities against non-muslims, so that its ultimate objective can be accomplished, to establish the rule of Islam throughout South Asia
 iem 2005 ke baad se puure bharat main darjanon hamalon kaa jimmedaar he, jiske chalate saikadon nirdosh nagarikon kii jaan gai he
 "this announcement shows that IM poses a great threat not only to the US but also to its close ally India," said Daniel Benjamin, coordinator of the State Department's anti-terrorism Affairs
 aaj kii yah karrwai pradarshit karti he ki ham bharat ke saath hai
 Benjamin said that this announcement is a very important step in our war against terrorism
 videsh mantralay ne kaha ki hamale karne kaa iem kaa mukhya tarika bheed bhare ilaakon main aapas main samanvay se kai sthanon par bam visphot karnaa he, jisamen aarthik or naagarik thikaanon ko nishaanaa banaaya jaataa he, taaki hataahaton kii sankhya zyada se zyada rahe
 In 2010, IM targeted a German bakery in Pune, killing 17 people
 iske pehle 2008 main dilli main iem ke hamale main 30 log maare gaye the
 The Foreign Ministry said that IM had also played an important role in the 2008 Mumbai attacks
 lashkar dwaara kiye gaye is hamale main 163 log maare gaye the
 The Ministry has said that as a result of this announcement, the physical and resource related support to the group will be restricted
 gut kii america or america logon ke niyantran main aane vaali sampatti kii jabti main bhi madad milegi
 a report from the US Congress that came about a fortnight ago marked IM as an emerging threat under India's indigenous Islamic factions
 isamen kaha gaya tha, bhale hi bharat is baat ko khule taur par sweekaar karne main hichake, par bharat main bhi swadeshi islamic aatankwaad kaa khatra he

 shaitan singh kaa puraa naam shaitan singh bhaati tha
 He is known for the 1962 indo-china war
 jiske liye unhen saal 1963 main maranoparant paramveer chakra se nawaja gaya tha
 Learn - How the Indian Army was heavily bombed by the Chinese Army In October 1962, China invaded India
 jab 13veen kumaunni batalian kii c company ladakh main tainaat thi
 The battalion had 120 personnel
 1962 kii jang main bhartiya javaanon ne rejang laa main chini sainikon kaa saamana kiya, jisaki aguai shaitan singh kar rahe the
 Let me tell, when China attacked in India at that time neither the soldiers had such weapons which could stand in front of China, nor the clothes were not there to avoid the fierce cold
 sainikon ko patale kapadon main mines ke temparechar main yuddh lard rahe the
 November 18, 1962 was the day when China, along with the Indian Army, attacked India
 bataa den bharat ke paas 120 sainik the vahi china ke paas kareeb 2000 hajaar sainik the
 When Shaitan Singh realizes the war, when Satan Singh realizes a major attack is coming from China, he sent a radio message to his officials and asked for help
 vahiin dukh kii baat ye he ki unhen kaha gaya ki abhi koi madad mumkeen nahin he
 With this, he was told to leave the post and leave all the soldiers (let me tell you, to leave the post means to give up)
 Not obeyed, Harman Shaitan Singh decided not to retreat
 vah ye baat bakhubi jaanate the ki vakt kam or china ke sainik kabhi bhi hamalaa bol sakate hai
 In such a situation, he immediately called his soldiers and said - "we are 120, the number of enemies may be more than us
" peeche se hamen koi madad nahin mil rahi he
 Maybe the weapons we have may fall short
 ho saktaa he ham se koi na bache or ham sab shahid ho jaae
 Those who want to save their lives are free to retreat, but i will fight till death
 shaitan singh kaa maananaa tha "praan jaae par vachan naa jaae"
 a strategy was prepared after this meeting
 shaitan singh ne kaha ki hamaare paas sansaadhan kam he or dushmano kii sankhya zyada he
 In such a situation, try not to waste a single bullet
 har goli nishane par lage
 With this, the gun should be snatched from the enemy when they are killed
 jab chini sena kaa saamana hua shaitan singh ke veeron sechini sena ye maan chuki thi ki bhartiya sena ne chaowkee chhod di he
 But she did not know that she was confronted by Jabanjh Shaitan Singh and his heroes
 sabah ke kareeb 5 baje bhartiya sainikon ne chini sena par goli barasaani shuru kar di
 In a short time, the corpses of the enemy were lying everywhere
 jab kuch chini maare gaye the us vakt major shaitan singh ne kaha tha ki ye mat samajhnaa yuddh kaa ant ho gaya he
 This is the beginning
 jiske baad china ne dobaaraa akraman kiya
 By the time the Indian troops had almost exhausted the bullets
 us vakt 5 se 7 goliyaan bachi thi
 The Chinese started firing on bongers with mortars and rockets on Rejang La
 bhartiya sainikon ko keval apane josh kaa sahaara tha, kyonki rejang laa par bunker bhi nahin the or dushman rocket daage ja rahaa tha
 Meanwhile, a bullet was also shot in the hand of Shaitan Singh
 bharatiyon kii haar thi sambhavasatan singh ye baat achche se jaanate the ki 2000 chini sainikon ke saamne 120 bhartiya haar jaaenge
 With this, he knew that if all the soldiers were martyred, the people of India and the government would never know what had happened in Rejang La
 jiske baad unhone do ghayal sainikon se kaha ki vah yahaan se turant chale jaae
 These two were named Ramchandra and Nihal Singh
 bataa den, nihaal singh ko chini kaidi apane saath le gaye the
 Only 14 soldiers were left alive in this mighty platoon of 13th Kumaon
 inamen bhi 9 gambhir rup se ghayal the
 Let me tell you, 1,300 Chinese soldiers were killed by 120 soldiers of India
 vahiin china ne apni aadhikarik report main ye kabool kar liya kar liya tha ki 1962 ke yuddh main sabase zyada nuksaan hua tha
 It was 3 months since the war ended in snow
 aise main shaitan singh ke shav ke bare main koi jaankaree nahin mili thi
 Rejang La's snow melted and the Red Cross Society and Army personnel began searching for him
 tab ek gadriye apni bhed charaane ke liye rejang kii ore ja rahaa tha vahiin badi si chattan main vardi main kuch najar aayaa
 After which he gave this information to the officials present there
 gadriye kii khabar ke baad jab sena vahaan pahunchi to unhone jo dekha use dekhakar sabake hosh ud gaye
 Each soldier sat holding his guns that day as if the fight was still going on
 unamem shaitan singh bhi apni bandook thame baithe the
 They looked as if still ready for war
 unamem abhi bhi josh baaki he
 It is not known how long the war lasted, but the soldiers of India kept fighting for the country till their last breath and while fighting, they came under fire
 major shaitan singh kaa unke hometown jodhpur main rajkeey sammaan ke saath antim sanskaar kiya gaya
 He was then awarded the Param Vir Chakra, the country's largest gallantry award
 aapako bataa den, aaj rejang laa aaj shoorveeron kaa tirth he
 Major Shaitan Singh has also been recorded in the pages of history as one such person
 jo saal 1962 main mahaj 37 varsh kii umr main desh par qurbaan ho gaye the
 We salute their martyrdom

 Shakuntala Hurray, a 57-year-old tribal widow in the village of Lohegaon in Ahmednagar district in Maharashtra, about 2,500 km west of Haq's house, has a similar story
 sarkaar kii ore se 1

 Haque and Hurray are two beneficiaries whose names were listed on the dashboard of the Rural Development Board after their houses were built
 yah keval gramin vikaas mantralay kii hi baat nahin he
 There are other ministries related to social welfare which are using such dashboards to extend the benefit of their programs to the needy people and keep an eye on them
 aaj vibhinn mantralayon or unke vibhaagon main is tarah ke kareeb chaar darjan dashaboard hai,jo sambandhit kaaryakramon kii pragati par har roj najar rakhte hai
 This increases the accountability of the government officials concerned — problems such as misappropriation of money, mismanagement of documents, fake beneficiaries have been largely overcome
 buniyadi dhaanche ke kshetra main kaaryakramon kii pragati par bhi is tareeke kaa istemaal karke najar rakhi ja rahi he
 The NITI Aayog now monitors programs in 15 ministries with basic construction such as housing, coal, energy and renewable energy, railways, rural roads and highway construction
 ayog ke siio amitabh kaant kehete hai,''ham apane lakshyon kii nigaraanee or yojanaon kii samiksha ke liye ek nai avadharana kaa istemaal kar rahe hai,jiskaa naam he,big data analysis,taaki sabhi sectoron main parinaam denevaala prashasan sunishchit kiya ja sake
 The NITI Aayog has appointed two data mining experts for this purpose, one is IIM Bangalore's Pulak Ghosh, whose job is to analyze massive data and to make the right policy decisions in terms of targets and implementation

 pradhanmantri karyaalay (piemo) ke ek sadsy kehete hai,''big data analysis abhi shuruaati daur main he or abhi tak yah mukhya rup se nijee kshetra tak hi simit tha
 The Government of India has started using it for the first time
 iske istemaal se paardarshita aegi or data kii madad se nagarikon kaa shashaktikaran hoga
 This new method of surveillance was formulated after several months of deliberations, in which the PMO has played an important role
 kaant ne piemo ke saamne kul 16 prajentation rakhe the
 Arvind Panagariya, former NITI Aayog vice-chairman, says, "we have at least one reliable measure to find out what is going on in every ministry of basic construction
" isse pehle hamen pataa hi nahin hota tha ki ham kahaan khadey hai
 "for example, the Union Ministry of Power has 13 dashboards to monitor every day's work, which shows what progress is going on in various schemes at that time and this data includes geo-tagged photographs of the beneficiaries
" Huh
 urja,koyala,akshay urja or khanan rajyamantri piyush goyal ne to nigaraanee or samiksha kii prakriya main jaise kranti hi laa di he
 For example, the dashboard named Merit India keeps an eye on whether the state is following the instructions of the State Energy Commission (SERC) to purchase power from the lowest cost sources
 rashtriya power exange se judaa ek anya dashaboard'vidyut pravaah'is baat par najar rakhata he ki ek hi samay main puure desh main samaan or vaazib daron par bijli uplabdh he yaa nahin
 It also manages electricity 'irrigation' to keep the rates under control
 2015 tak aisa ek bhi din nahin hota tha jab ek hi samay samaan dar par bijli bechi jaati rahi ho
 In June 2017, the rate of parity across the country was 94 percent
 'garv'dashaboard aadhaar card ke jariye bijli conekshnon par najar rakhata he
 An example: On July 19, Bachan Ram got a new connection under Deendayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana in Bajwagaon of Bhojpur district in Bihar
 agle din unka naam jeeyo-tag photo ke saath post kar diya gaya
 On the same day the dashboard showed that out of 277 houses in Bajwa, the number of houses with electricity connections was 233
 goyal ne apane chaar mantralayon main badi yojanaon kii pragati par najar rakhane keliye ek andruni dashaboard bhi laga rakhaa he

 hare rang kaa matlab he'kaam chal rahaa he'nila rang'kaam main deree'naarangi rang'kaam main thodi si deree'or pilaa rang'kaam main 30 yaa usase zyada dinon kii deree'bataata he
 It is interesting that due to this, India's position has improved in the World Bank's ease of getting electricity and it has risen from the 99th position to 26th three years ago
 dashaboard aadhaarit prashasan main upgrah or duusari takneekon ke istemaal kaa shandaar nateeja dekhne ko mil rahaa he
 Like the Prime Minister's Rural Roads Scheme, where the construction speed is reportedly 130 km per day in 2016-17
 se zyada thi
 25,000 km a year three years ago
 sadak banaai gai thi
 This figure 47,000 km in 2016-17
 tak pahunch gaya
 But the monitoring system also revealed minor flaws — about 18 percent of the roads connecting the villages were falling a few hundred feet
 dashaboard main data daalane se lekar jeeyo-tanging karnaa,labhaarthiyon kii saaf tasviir kheenchna or kab tathaa kaise dashaboard par unhen post karnaa,badi mehnat kaa kaam he
 An example of how public dashboards can be successful is 'my Road' which oversees the construction of rural roads
 log sadakon par gaddhon kii jeeyo-tag tasviren post kar sakate hai or saat din ke bheetar adhikariyon ko us par karrwai kerani hoti he
 In 2016-17, the Ministry of Rural Development received around 56,000 complaints with photographs
 vitt varsh ke aakhri din 31 march,2017 ko keval 70 shikaayatein lambit thim
 The rural housing track dashboard shows that the government had built 32 lakh houses in 2016-17, in contrast to the target of constructing one crore pucca houses for the poor in 2019, which is an encouraging figure

 In the MGNREGA, the dashboard-based administration has brought a big change
 narendra modi sarkaar ne is yojana ko parisampatti nirmaan se jodakar kaaphi kargar bana diya he
 Almost every MNREGA asset is listed on the dashboard
 zyada bajet aavanton ke saath is yojana kii nirantar nigaraanee se parisampattiyon kii sankhya main kaaphi ijapha (2016 main 60 lakh se zyada) hua he
 Drones are also being used for the first time to monitor various projects
 khanan ke kshetra main mineral exploration korporation limited dohan ke liye drone kaa istemaal karata he,jabaki bijli mantralay transmishan linon main gadabadi kaa pataa lagane ke liye inkaa istemaal kar rahaa he
