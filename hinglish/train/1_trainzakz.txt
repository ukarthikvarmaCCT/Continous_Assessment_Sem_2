 This is the reason that Bollywood has been creating stories on Jammu and Kashmir frequently
 dharti par jananath ke naam se mashhoor kashmir kii naa keval sundarataa ko camere par utaara he balki is jagah ke traasadee or syah pahaluon ko bhi ujagar karne main safal rahaa he
 In the 60s, Kashmir was considered the prime location for Bollywood films
 1961 main ai film junglee kaa pehla half srinagar ke barfile pahaado main shoot kiya gaya tha
 Shammi Kapoor gained tremendous popularity in this film with the song 'chahe Koi Mere Junglee Kahe'
 is gane kii safalataa ke saath hi kashmir bollywood ke alaava tourists kii bhi pehali pasand ban gaya tha
 After this, many films were made to capitalize on the beauty of Kashmir
 film kashmir kii kali ke zyaadaatar songs dal jhil ke aasapaas hi shoot hue the
 Many Angle were shot in these films like women riding bicycles in the Valley of Kashmir, the routine of the local people
 vahiin tamaam filmon main kashmir keval gaanon main hi dikhaai detaa tha kai filmein aisi bhi release hui jisamen balldrop hi kashmir ko banaaya gaya
 The 1965 film Arju was based on a skiing chapter and a local girl's love story
 kashmir ke balldrop par bani saal 1965 main release hui shashi kapur starer 'jab jab phool khile' bollywood blockbster sabit hui thi
 Many songs of that era have become immortal with the beauty and charismatic lyrics of Kashmir
 paradesiyo se naa ankhiyaan milaanaa, e naragis mastaana, pukaarata chalaa hum main, ye chand sa roshan cheharaa jaise kai gane hai jinhone naa keval dharti par jananath se logon ko rubaru karaane kaa kaam kiya, balki bollywood ke itihaas ke sabase shandaar romantic or darshanik gaanon main apana naam darj karaane main kaamyaab rahe
 'ye Chand Sa Roshan Pyaar', shot at Dal Lake in Kashmir, is still considered as one of Bollywood's most romantic classic
 lekin vakt ke saath kashmir kii sthaneey raajnneeti badalati gai or iskaa asar filmon main bhi najar aata rahaa
 After the growing tension between India and Pakistan, terrorist incidents, separatism and the mobilization of the Indian Army in Kashmir, the beautiful Kashmir seen in all the films changed
 barfile pahaad, khubasurat vaadiyaan ab bhi balldrop main dikhti, lekin filmon kaa subject prem or romance se raajnneeti, yuddh, army ke mishan, aatankwaad jaise vishyon kii ore shift hota gaya
 In the 90s, due to the increasing tension in Kashmir, the subject of films witnessed tremendous changes
 bollywood is khubasurat ghati main faile dark pahaluon ko ujagar karne kii koshish karne laga
 Hrithik Roshan's films from Mission Kashmir to Tahan, Fana, Roja, Sikandar, Haider have been seen trying to show the tragedy spread in the intestines of Kashmir
 ye filmein keval vahaan kii sarriyal vaadiyon ko hi camere par kaid nahin kar rahi thim, balki kashmir main sena ke grey shades, kashmir kii aam janata or vahaan ke soshal or duusare political culture ko bhi rupahale parde par dikhaane kii koshish kar rahi thim
 At times, there have also been attempts to show how an entire generation in the valley has come for the revenge fire due to violence in their lives, how some opportunistic and separatist people are using such youth to shine their politics
 aise kai pratidwnd or takaraavon ko khubasurat vaadiyon se dikhaakar kai filmon ke sahare hi baaki desh ke log yahaan kii syah sachai se rubaru hue
 According to the reality of Kashmir, Bollywood films have changed drastically, so after the recent decision of the central government, it is expected that things will change in a positive direction in Kashmir
 grahamantri amit shah ne kashmir se anuchhed 370 ko hataane kii ghoshnaa kar di he
 The government made it clear that Kashmir would be made a union territory from the state so that the terror spread there could be controlled and the path of development in the life of common Kashmiris could be strengthened
 is kadam ko kashmir or baaki desh ke logon ko saath laane ke prayaas ke taur par bhi dekha ja rahaa he
 It will be interesting to see whether things in Kashmir will move in a positive direction or the situation there will go from bad to worse, in such a situation it will be interesting to see that in the coming years, Bollywood terror and duality created in Kashmir will only be on the dark narrative
 Will work or will there be a change in films related to Kashmir

 narmada bachaao andolan kaa rajghat satyagrah guuruuvaar-shuukravaar ke bich der raat baandh ke get kholane kaa aadesh jari karne or badvani colector ke aashwaasan par sthagit kiya gaya he
 a joint survey will be conducted with representatives of the government and the movement of all the affected
 sarkari punarvaas samitiyon main andolan ke pratinidhiyon ko bhi shaamil kiya jayega
 a meeting will be held with the minister of Narmada Valley Development Authority soon
 lekin sawaal he ki kyon koi medha patkar 39 saalon baad bhi narmada bachaane khadi ho rahi hai
 Once again the banners of the Narmada Bachao Andolan were sitting on the ground-sinking dharna, dam gate opened, assurance of better future
 
 
 dub prabhavit dharne se uth gaye
 To date, the water level of the Narmada is slightly below 131 meters, but the historic Rajghat is surrounded by water
 
 
 sardaar sarovar baandh kii dub main aa rahe rajghat kukara main guuruuvaar subah teji se pani bharaa 
 
 
 The Collector and SP arrived for inspection at 11 pm on Wednesday
 
 
 raat main hi narmada main badhate pani ko lekar guuruuvaar subah se dub kshetra main lagi dukaane, makaan, mandir or ashramon ko tin shed main visthapit karne ke nirdesh die the
 Two years ago, we showed you a picture of this house of these migrants
 aaj jab unka gussa phuta to in tin shedon kii haalat badali nahin thi
 People also alleged that the plots were given, but 5
 80 lakh kaa package nahin mila aise main kaise chale jaaen
 For the last four days, the water level of Narmada has been increasing with back water
 buudhvaar se shuru hui barish ke chalate narmada kii sahaayak nadiyon main ufaan aayaa hua he
 Due to which the water level of Narmada went up every second on Thursday
 raat main aane jane vaale ekmaatr rasta bhi band ho gaya
 Due to which the boat had to be floated in water on the road to and from Rajghat
 vaise yah pehali baar nahin hua, narmada ghati main ban rahe baandhon kii shrinkhalaa ne thok ke bhav main gaanv or aabaadi bedakhal kii
 We remembered and forgot Harsud
 
 
 lekin aise ek nahin kareeb dhai sau gaanv sardaar sarovar main samaa gayi
 The government tried to tell that the dams are the need of the people, but on many occasions it also got more government stubbornness
 jab logon ne visthaapan ke liye hathiyaar daalaa to 36 sau karod rupye aise bhrashtachar kii bhent chadhe ki asthai lagane vaale shed 
 
 
 They became permanent
 khamiyaja sardaar sarovar ke 193 gaanvon ke kareeb 40 hajaar parivaar aaj bhi bhugat rahe hai!ye maamla itnaa penchida rahaa ki kai dashak nikal gaye narmada nadi par sardaar sarovar baandh pariyojna kaa udghaatan 1961 main pandit jawahar laal nehru ne kiya tha
 But the sharing of water between Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan was not agreed
 In 1969, the government set up the Narmada Water Disputes Tribunal so that the water dispute was resolved in 1979
 The Narmada Valley Project was born in 1985
 The World Bank announced a loan of $ 450 million for this project, the government said that the project will generate electricity in 2 out of three states
 27 karod hectare bhoomi kii sinchai hogi lekin badi baat ye thi isaki keemat teen rajyon kii 37000 hectare bhoomi to chukaana tha a population of lakhs was displaced in 248 villages, corruption of crores also occurred in displacement
 eses jha kii adhyakshata vaali cameti ne jab jaanch kii to pataa laga ki 3636 registrion main 1800 farzi hai
 The land is occupied by a dominant, while the registry is in the name of a displaced
 yahi nahin lagbhag 88 punarvaas sthalon par hue karodon rupe ke nirmaan kaary main bhi karodon kaa ghapala hua
 Medha Patekar stood with her colleagues for these displaced
 
 
 1989 main harsood main aam sabha, 1990 main sangharsh yatra iham padaav bane, 1993 main bhukh hadtaal hui to 1994 main vishwa bank ne is pariyojna se apane haath khinch liye
 In 1995, the Supreme Court said that the government should stop the remaining work of the dam until the rehabilitation of the displaced people is managed
 18 aktubar, 2000 ko sarvocch nyaayalay ne baandh ke kaam ko phir shuru karne tathaa isaki oonchai 90 meter tak badhaane kii manjuuri de di
 But it also added that rehabilitation would be done well to ensure that the environment would not be threatened
 visthapit logon ke purnvas ke liye nae disha-nirdesh die jinke mutabik purnvasit logon ke liye 500 logon par ek primary skool, ek panchayat ghar, ek chikitsaalay, pani tathaa bijli kii vyavastha tathaa ek dharmik sthal bananaa tha 
 
 
 But nothing happened
 medha patkar kahati hai 32000 parivaar aaj bhi sardaar sarovar ke dub kshetra main hote hue ek ek gaanv main hajaar parivaar hote hue punarvaas sampurna naa hote hue ye naa kanoonee he ki unke ghar dubaaya jaaen
 Gujarat is not giving 30 crores, nor is giving electricity why in such a situation, 192 villages must be moved ahead today
 vaise 56 saal baad apane janmdin ke din jab pradhanmantri narendra modi ne baandh kaa udghaatan kiya tab tak isaki adhiktam oonchai 138
 68 meters had been fixed
 vaise jab baandh kaa udghaatan hua tha tab madhyapradesh main bijepi kii sarkaar thi, rajya main sarkaar badalane ke baad sarkaar ke ruukh main badlaav aayaa he
 The Madhya Pradesh government says that Gujarat is not even providing electricity and thousands of people are yet to be rehabilitated, which Gujarat has to pay
 aise main madhya pradesh gujarat ko adhik pani nahin de saktaa he
 However, there are unhappy people amid claims of power, water and progress
 
 
 39 saal baad bhi jinke liye dhara ke khilaaf koi medha patkar hi khadi hai
 Tamil Nadu Deputy Chief Minister o Panneerselvam said on Saturday that he had merged into the AIADMK (AIADMK) led by k Palaniswami on the insistence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 paneerselvam ne annadramuk ke donon dhadon ke vilay ke kareeb chah maheene baad yah khulaasa kiya he
 After this disclosure by Panneerselvam, the speculation that was being made about the new BJP partner in Tamil Nadu is being stamped

 AAP should become a minister and politics should continue
 ' paneerselvam theni main annadramuk ke ek kaarykram ko sambodhit kar rahe the jisamen unhone yah khulaasa kiya
 Panneerselvam's statement also confirms the speculation that the agreement on the merger between the two factions of the AIADMK could be finalized after several rounds of talks with BJP leaders
 paneerselvam ne iske saath hi kai chaunkaane vaale khulaase bhi kiye hai
 He claimed that after the death of Jayalalithaa, the former head of AIADMK, she had to undergo a lot of persecution
 unhone kaha, 'mujhe kai samasyaon kaa saamana karnaa padaa, itnaa utpeedit hona padaa jisaki koi seemaa nahin he
 If someone else was in my place, he would have committed suicide
 mujhe yah sab kuch ammaa kii vajah se sahanaa padaa, bardaasht karnaa padaa
 Jayalalithaa was known as Amma among her supporters
 pichley saal farvari main tamilnadu ke purv siem paneerselvam ne party main baghawat kar di thi or party ke ek dhade ke saath alag ho gaye the
 He claimed that he was being forced to resign from the Chief Minister
 baghawat ke baad party kii mahasachiv vikeshashikalane unhen AIADMK ke koshadhyaksh pad se nilambit kar diya tha
 The two factions of the AIADMK merged in August last year after considerable political turmoil
 shashikala ke bhrashtachar ke ek maamle main jail jane ke baad party ke donon dhadon main samjhauta ho paaya tha

 jaise ki sansadeey maamalon ke rajyamantri mukhtaar abbaas nakvi kaa yah kahana ki gomance kaa seven karne waalon ko pakistan chale janaa chahie
 The reporter also pointed to Rijiju sitting with Singh and said that he has said on the advice of Naqvi that if he consumes beef, should he go to Pakistan? is sawaal par rajnath singh apni gahari muskaan nahin roak paae or bas itnaa kaha, 've sabhi log jo bharat main rahete hai, bharat main rahenge

 This Lok Sabha seat falling under Chhota Udaipur district went to the Bharatiya Janata Party account in the last election
 anusuchit janajati (ST) ke liye arakshit is loksabhaa kshetra main adivasee samaaj kii badi sankhya he
 last two elections and Ram Singh Rathwa has become MP twice in a row
 raajnneetik prishthbhumichhota udaipur seat par pehla chunaav immergency ke baad 1977 main hua tha
 In this first election itself, the Congress won from here and Amar Singh Rathwa became the first MP
 iske baad 1980 or 1984 ke chunaav main bhi amarsingh rathva ne paracham laharaaya or sansad pahunche
 The 1989 election changed here and Naranbhai Rathwa defeated Amarsingh Rathwa on a Janata Dal ticket
 janata dal kaa vighatan hone par unhone aglaa chunaav yani 1991 kaa aam chunaav janata dal (gujarat) ke tikat par ladaa or ek baar phir jeet darj kii
 Naranbhai Rathwa now held on to the Congress and won again in the 1996 election
 1998 kaa chunaav bhi naranbhai rathva ne congress ke tikat par apane naam kar liya
 But on his victory in 1999, bjp's Ramsingh Rathwa put a break
 haalanki, ramsingh bahut hi maamuli antar se unhen haraa paae, lekin is chunaav main naranbhai kaa vijayrath ruk gaya
 In 2004, when the bjp's Shining India slogan across the country failed, Naranbhai returned again and defeated Ramsingh Rathwa

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also attacked the Jawaharlal Nehru's Kashmir policy during his speech in the Lok Sabha

 It is being said on Bhagwat's statement that while addressing the volunteers in Muzaffarpur, Bihar on Sunday, Mohan Bhagwat had said that we will be ready immediately if the country needs us and our constitution and laws are allowed
 swayamsevakon kii kuwwat kaa bakhaan karte hue sangh pramukh ye bhi kah gaye ki sena ko taiyaar hone main 6-7 maheene lag jaaenge, lekin ham do se teen din main hi taiyaar ho jaaenge, kyonki hamaara anushaasan hi aisa he

 During those tense moments during the campaign against Laden, the beating of Obama and his national security assistants was intensified several times

 Such distraction occurred when Sasha was three months old and had a meningitis

 Obama said in the CBS News show 60 Minutes that everyone in the situation room was tense and his nervousness was increasing as the campaign period against Laden increased
 duniya kaa sarvaadhik vaanchit or kukhyat aatankwaadi osama bin laden (54) do may ko pakistan ke abtabad main america balon ke ek safal abhiyaan main maaraa gaya tha
 Officials said the special American forces operation took about 40 minutes and that in the last round of these 40 minutes, Laden was killed
 america raashtrapati ne kaha, ham sthiti par najar rakh rahe the
 We were watching what was happening around the campus but we could not get any information about the developments inside the campus
 obama ne kaha ki jis abhiyaan ko manjuuri di gai thi vah khatre se khaali nahin tha kyonki abtabad main laden kii maujuudagi ke bare main unka (raashtrapati kaa) koi bhi sahaayak yaa khufia adhikari 100 fisadi aashwast nahin tha
 He said, i would say it was important
 yah mahatvapurn isliye tha kyonki hamane alqaida ke khilaaf ladaai main bahut khun or dhan bahaya he
 Since 2001, even before the bombings at the embassy in Kenya
 obama ne kaha, maine khud se kaha ki yadi hamen acha mauka mila jisamen ham bhale hi alqaida ko puri tarah parrast nahin kar paae lekin use buree tarah asthir kar diya to yah raajnneetik khatre or hamaare aadamiyon ko khatre se kahin adhik mahatvapurn he
 The President said that at the very end of the campaign he came to know that Laden was killed
 unhone kaha ki jab tak har vyakti helicopter main baith kar waapas thikaane kii ore nahin chalaa gaya, tab tak asamanjas barkaraar tha
 Arriving at the hideout, the soldiers said that Jeronimo was killed
 obama ne kaha, jeronimo laden ke liye ek chhadam naam tha
 Apparently our men were dropping arrows in the dark so everyone was cautious but everyone had hope
 unhone kaha ki unhone abhiyaan ke baad raahat kii saans lee or vah chaahate the ki america sainik pakistan kii seemaa se nikal jaaen or surakshit rup se, thikaane par helicopter se utar jaaen
 The President said that he is very proud of his party and he is satisfied with his work

 Lalu's lyrics echo the election bugle
 2 baras pehle jinke haathon main apni laalaten saunp rakhi thi, aaj us congress par tan-tan kar tir chode ja rahe hai
 Lalu's target of the Congress to completely contest the Muslim vote, considered part of the BJP-JDU nexus, was stunned by Congress supremo Lalu Prasad, accusing the Congress of cheating the unions from the independence of the country till now
 The party which was planning to mislead the untouchables at the time of elections, has now got itself trapped in its mausoleum, for which it is now nick It is difficult

 He said, "the reclusive powers could not sit on the chair of Delhi, for this, the people of the Akali community voted for the Congress and made it work in the center, but instead of giving something to this community, they cut the people of this community so sweetly
 And did halal which he could not even realize
 congress kaa naam liye bina uski tulana dengue machhar se karte hue lalu ne kaha ki anya machhar khabardaar kar logon ko katata he par dengue machhar bina khabardaar kiye logon ko dans letaa he
 Describing the present Congress state unit of Bihar as a group of people drawn from all other parties, he said that the state headquarters of the said party used to come from one to one Vibhuti at Sadaqat Ashram and from there a message was sent to the entire state, but today there This is the situation that is locked and the ticket is being hit due to greed for money

 Lalu claimed the lack of leadership and lack of support in the Congress in Bihar and said that this party is contesting in these elections with the aim of benefiting the BJP only by harming the RJD and other parties but its pulses are not melting
 
 congress mahasachiv rahul gandhi ko desh or adhik ghoomane kaa suzav dete hue lalu ne kaha ki unke liye abhi bahut kuch siikhnaa baaki he
 He said this in response to a question asked on Rahul's statement of telling the RSS and Simmi the same
 rajd supremeo ne kaha ki unhone purv main kai baar simmi ke saath aresas, bajrang dal sahit anya dharmik unmaad failaane waalon par pratibandh lagaae jane kii maang kii thi par aisa nahin kiya gaya

 What does a goat like to eat when he is hungry? The question is very simple but if it is said in the answer that 'two thousand notes', then the matter seems a bit strange

 Today, while rallying in the Tamluk of Bengal, Prime Minister Narendra Modi attacked Bengal CM Mamta Banerjee fiercely
 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki aaj jai shri ram kehane waalon ko didi giraftaar kar rahi he, aaj unhen bhagwaan kaa naam lenaa bhi khatak rahaa he
 During his speech, PM Modi spoke in Hindi and sometimes spoke a lot in Bengali
 raily main piem modi ne kaha ki pakistan ke paale-pose aatanki masood ajahar ko yuan ne aatanki ghoshit kiya, ye sunakar deshavaasiyon ko khushi hui
 But did anyone hear Didi praising the country, perhaps Didi would be afraid
 agar masood ajahar par kuch bol diya to unke votbank par khatra aa jayega
 At the rally, PM Modi said that speed breaker Didi tried to do politics on the cyclone too
 phani ke baad maine mamata didi se phone par baat karne kii koshish kii, lekin didi kaa ahankaar itnaa zyada he ki unhone mujhase baat nahin kii
 i was waiting for Didi to call me back, but they did not
 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki main aaj bhi bengal ke adhikariyon ke saath baithak karnaa chahta tha, lekin didi ne manaa kar diya
 But the central government stands with Bengal, the way India has dealt with the cyclone is being praised in the world
 mamata banerjee par hamalaa karte hue unhone kaha ki yahaan aaj maa saraswati kii puja karne par bhi roak lagaai ja rahi he
 There is a scam in the recruitment of teachers as well, these people are also taxing education

 Let me tell you that a video came out two days ago in which some people had raised slogans of Jai Shri Ram in front of Mamata Banerjee, on which Mamta was provoked

 BJP is seeking 135 seats in the state of Rajshivasena to give 128 seats to Shiv Sena
 Even though there was no dispute about the alliance between Shiv Sena and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in 2019 Lok Sabha elections in Maharashtra, this time also in assembly elections
 The same picture is being seen as was seen in the 2014 assembly elections
 fark sirf itnaa he ki is baar bijepi gathbandhan kaa stearing sambhaal rahi he
 According to sources, the BJP has made it clear to the Shiv Sena that the number of seats that both parties had won in the last assembly elections will be with both parties
 baaki jo siten bachengi usamen bantwaaraa hoga
 Accordingly, Shiv Sena is getting 115 seats
 vahiin shivasena ne bijepi ke is bantwaare par aapatti jataai he or kaha he ki loksabhaa chunaav 2019 ke dauraan munkhyamantri devendra fadanvis ne kaha tha vidhansabha chunaavon main siton ko bantwaaraa baraabar hoga
 Last week, Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray had said that a coalition would be announced for the assembly elections in a few days, but it has not been announced even after 7 days
 bataa den ki 2014 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main shivasena 150 siton se neeche jane ko taiyaar nahin thi or isi vajah se is baar bijepi taalamatol vaala ravaiya apana rahi he
 Sources say that although the Shiv Sena leadership is ready to contest fewer seats than last time, despite this, Shiv Sena is not ready for the 128 seats offered by the BJP
 shivasena kam se kam 135 seat maang rahi he
 The seat-sharing is getting tougher because both the parties have filled the leaders of Congress and NCP in their party
 bijepi or shivasena main shaamil hone vaale netaa siton par apane tikat nishchit karne ke baad hi congress or ensipi kaa daaman choda he
 The move is also seen in such a way that both the parties are secretly preparing to contest separate assembly elections in case of alliance
 uddhav thakare ne shuukravaar ko vyangyatmak tippanee karte hue kaha tha ki unhone fadanvis ko shivasena ke ummidavaaron kii suchi taiyaar karne or is silsile main bataane ko kaha tha
 Fadnavis is taking a stoic attitude
 sutron kaa kahana he ki shivasena paristhitiyon ke hisaab se siton ke bantwaare ko sweekaar karegi
 However, some Shiv Sena leaders are pressurizing Uddhav Thackeray not to compromise on less than 135 seats

 a series of accusations against each other is also going on
 isi bich bijepi ne vipakshi dalon par bada aarope lagaaya he
 The party says opposition parties are resorting to 'fake news' against senior BJP leaders to create resentment and rift in certain caste groups as they fear defeat in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections

 Yesterday, many areas of Mumbai had to face heavy power crisis

 isse mumbai ke kai ilaakon ko kal gambhir bijli sankat kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 Tata Power claimed that if Best had bought power from six oil and gas based 500 MC units, the distribution company could have met the power shortage after tripping and the city would not have to bear load shedding
 vahiin, duusari ore best ke mahaprabandhak om prakaash gupta ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha, 'ham nahin jaanate ki yah vastav main tripping thi yaa yah jabaran kiya gaya

 ' haalanki, kal best ne tata power kii adhik kadi aalochana kii thi

 iske baad lok janashakti party (lojpa) ne bhi seat bantwaare ko lekar bhaajapa par dabaav bananaa shuru kar diya
 After a tweet by LJP parliamentary board leader and Jamui MP Chirag Paswan, the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) continued to predict where LJP quit the NDA
 vahiin, bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) bachaav main utar ai
 Chirag had increased by tweeting bjp's troublemaker Jamui MP Chirag Paswan tweeted on Tuesday night, acknowledging that the NDA was going through a delicate phase, wrote, "telugu Desam Party (TDP) and Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP) It is going through a delicate turn after breaking away from the NDA alliance

 Gopal Kanda, who was imprisoned for 18 months in the Geetika suicide case, has been released on bail
 lekin kanda kii jamaanat par sawaal uth rahe hai
 The question is whether Gopal Kanda has used his influence for this and got bail on the basis of fake documents
 kanda ki jamaanat yah sawaal geetika ke bhai ankit sharma ne uthaaye hai
 Geetika's family said that the court did not even listen to her plea
 unhone kaha ki gopal kanda ne farji dastavejon ke aadhaar par jamaanat paayi he
 He appealed to the court to decide his bail only after examining the documents related to Kanda's wife
 geetika ke bhai ankit sharma ne kaha, ‘gopal kanda kaa apni patni ke biimaar hone sambandhit dastavej pehali najar main hi farji lagata he
 Ankit demanded that these documents be investigated and only after that Gopal Kanda's bail is decided
 lekin adaalat ne unki daleel nahin suni
 Geetika's brother Ankit Sharma said, "gopal Kanda is still so powerful that he has managed to get bail by making fake documents while staying in jail
" ab baahar aane ke baad vah power kaa puraa istemaal kar saktaa he
 Ankit has raised questions that the OPD paper's date and time of ward in the government hospital in Delhi, where Gopal Kanda's wife has been treated, create a doubt
 jo dawa gopal kanda kii patni ko di ja rahi he vah uske anusaar use aspataal main hona chahie
 Why is he being treated at home in such a serious condition? Gopal Kanda lives in Gurgaon but his wife is undergoing treatment at the government OPD
 aise main unhe nyaay ki jald ummid nahin he
 The case is dated 5 August 2012
 haryana ke grih rajya mantri gopal kanda ke emdlaar kii airhostess geetika sharma ne ashok vihaar sthit apane ghar par hi faansee kar liya tha or apni maut ke liye gopal kanda or aruna chadda ko jimmedaar tehraaya tha
 Now after 18 months bail has been received, so Geetika's family is considering it as the influence of Gopal Kanda
 or ashanka jataa rahe hai ki ab iskaa prabhaav gavaahon par bhi pad saktaa he

 agle do muqablon main agar aisa nahin ho sakaa to anand ke liye kaaphi der ho jaaegi

 Carlson did a lot of fast moves with black pieces while Anand took a long time
 jab tak unke sochane kaa samay aayaa tab tak drow lagbhag tay ho chukaa tha
 Carlson is now just four draws away from retaining the title
 carlson galtiyaan karne ke aadi nahin hai or khitaab ke kareeb pahunchakar apana sarvshereshth pradarshan karte hai
 Anand will now have to do his best regardless of white or black pieces to get himself out of the tricky situation
 bhartiya khemaa ek or sicilian dephence apnaane kii soch rahaa hoga, lekin chathe mukaable main anand kii karaari haar unke jehan main hogi
 Anand came under pressure early in the sixth match and could not overcome it

 Anand will play black pieces tomorrow

 Seeing your work, people will be trying to show the courage even below? Yes, during 'munnabhai' many people said, 'who will see this Gandhigiri', but in the end, people will appreciate by watching the work, and my moral is increased, my film After much enthusiasm has increased, and people have changed, people still tell how they have changed
 3 idiyats kii casting kaise hui?aamir 40 ke the, or mujhe college kii film banani thi, 3 yuva student ko lekar banani thi, kai actors ko koshish kii, ek din aamir or vinod chopra kii baat hui, phone par aamir ne script suni or kaha ki main ek student kaa kirdaar kar luungaa, luk test hua or phir ban gayi film, or aap dhyaan se dekhiye college ke saare log thode thode zyaada umr ke rakhe gaye the
 Aamir, Baman, Sanjay, how are these people to work? Every actor has his own strengths, Aamir and Baman believe in rehearsals, Sanju is such that he has his own style and he reads the 2 page dialogue in 5 minutes So takes but delivers by his style, Arshad also performs in his own way
 main bahut bhaagyashaalee hum ki aise aise actors ke saath kaam karne ko mila
 Whether it is Kareena or Anushka
 imoshan se aap bahut khelte hai, ye kaise kar pate hai?ham bachapan se daraavnee filmein bhi dekhne jate the to cycle se, jis se ki vaapis aate vaqt or dar lage, to isliye mujhe aisi filmein pasand hai banani, jo ki har imoshan ko chhuen
 The names of the characters in your films are very unique, why? i was a big fan of Amit ji, he used to have the name 'vijay' in every film
 vaise hi shahrukh har film main raaj, rahul
 So i said that whenever i make films, i will keep unique names, so Rancho, Ranchoddas, Jagat Janani
 
 i remember my senior's name was 'funsukh Ladakhi'
 or ek chaay kii dukaan kaa naam tha 'wangdu tii stall', to vahaan se wangdu liya or ban gaya 'funsukh wangdu'
 How did you meet Sanjay Dutt? Are you going to make a film on his life? When Sanju came on parole, i thought i knew him a lot, but when he came, he started to tell me whatever he started telling me, and every day i and Arjit 6- We spent 7 hours sitting with Sanju, we did this for 25 days and his life is nothing short of a story
 anderworld, films, link aps, shaadiyaan, rishte, to hamen laga ki uski kahani bolni chahie
 Drugs case, court case, relationship with father, have not heard such a story in life, we have started work
 ranbir banenge sanjay?ranbir kaaphi miltaa julata dikhataa he, sanjay dutt ke yuva dinon kii tarah, rocky film main aap dekhen to ranbir acha sanjay dutt ban saktaa he
 If you look carefully, Ranbir seems very close to that character
 munnabhai kii siries main ab koun aayega?bilkul sanjay hi rahenge chaahe kuch bhi ho
 Your heroine Munnabhai keeps changing in the series? My friend Arjit told that in Charlie Chaplin's films, only Charlie is remembered, there is no actress around him
 to hamane bhi sanjay dutt ko centre kirdaar diya he, or script ke hisaab se heroin lete hai
 What is your son doing? He is still studying, keeps making films with small cameras, now i cannot even say anything because i have made 3 Idiots
 or ek din maine kaha ki 'tum padhai nahin karte', to usne kaha ki papa aapane hi to kaha he ki jo dil kare, jis main man lag, vahi karo
 
 ' to jo uskaa man karegaa, main chaahunga wo wo hi kare
 It's a Novak kind of night! @djokernole d 21st seed Albert # ramosvinolas 6-2 6-3 6-3 to advance to the 4R for the 11th time, where he will meet Hyeon # Chung

 com / zffskzypgq Terror training is imparted in BJP and ASS camps
 bhari sabha main ye baat kehane ke baad grih mantri scindia baahar aate hi mukar bhi gaye
 He said that i had spoken of saffron terror, not Hindu
 jaipur chintan shivi main congress mishan 2014 par manthan kar rahi thi ki tabhi susheel kumaar scindia ke ek bayaan se aisi chingaari uthi jo dekhte-dekhte sholon main badal gai
 Although the charge of communalism on the Sangh and the BJP is not new, but this time the country's home minister used the word Hindu terrorism to spark a big controversy
 susheel kumaar scindia kaa itnaa kahana tha ki bijepi aag babula ho uthi
 The BJP gave Shinde's statement not just unfortunate but dangerous for the environment of the country
 scindia kii jo baat bijepi ko nashtar kii tarah chubhi, congress ke kai netaa usee baat ko or jor-shor se kehane ke liye saamne aa gaye
 Mani Shankar Aiyar even went on to say that he was 100 percent in agreement with Shinde's words
 haalanki bavaal badhane par saafe-safaai kaa silsilaa bhi shuru ho gaya
 Rajiv Shukla first jumped into Shinde's defense, then Home Minister Shinde turned around and, amidst a barrage of questions, confessed heartily that he made a mistake by using the word Hindu terrorism
 lekin bhagava brigade saafe safaai kii in koshishon se katai ittefaq nahin rakhata

 The duel between Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan and Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi has not stopped

 Modi's face is missing from the hoarding-banner for traveling in Ujjain
 bijepi main narendra modi ek bade netaa ke taur par ubhar rahe hai
 The party may not have declared him a contender for the post of Prime Minister, but he has already revealed his strategy by making him the chairman of the Election Committee
 vahiin modi se duuri rakhane vaale netaaon main pramukh laalkrishna adwani madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri chouhan ko modi se behatar mukhyamantri bataane se bhi nahin hichake hai
 Advani has been weak in BJP since Chauhan was described as a better chief minister than Modi, and Modi's position is getting stronger from time to time
 iske baavjood madhya pradesh kii bijepi ab bhi modi ko bada netaa sweekaar karne ko taiyaar nahin he
 This is the reason why Modi's pictures are not even seen in any grand event to be held in the state
 taaja maamla mukhyamantri chouhan kii jan aashirwad yatra kaa he
 Ujjain is being decorated like a bride for the journey, banner-posters are installed on every side

 Along with this, former Chief Minister of the state Uma Bharti is also missing from these banners
 sarkaar ke khaadya va naagarik aapurti mantri paras jain kehete hai ki modi to har yuva ke dil main sthaan rakhte hai, magar ve hording main modi kii tasviren na hone kaa jawaab nahin de paae
 At the same time, the party is not ready to consider it as part of any politics or strategy
 bijepi kii ore se puure desh main modi ko chunaav prachaar kii kaman saunpi ja chuki he, magar madhya pradesh kii bijepi ab bhi unke kad ko aasaani se nahin sweekaar kar paa rahi he

 Speaker of the Andhra Pradesh Assembly k Shiv Prasad has given a shocking statement about women
 rashtriya mahila sansad ke tahat ek press-meet main shiv prasad ne kaha ki agar ham mahilaon ko car kii tarah ghar main park kar rakhen to unke saath rape nahin hoga
 When women get exposure in society, they become victims of such crimes
 shiv prasad telugudesham party se vidhayak hai
 In his four-minute address, on the issue of women's empowerment, he said that you buy a car, when you park it in a garage there is no possibility of an accident, is it? Accident can happen when you take him to the market or street
 50 kii speed par accident hone kii sambhaavna kam hoti he lekin sau kii speed par ye bad jaati he
 She said that earlier when women were women housewives she was protected from all kinds of crimes except discrimination, but today women are getting exposure in the society because they are getting good education, jobs and doing business
 chhedchhad, shoshan, rape, apharan kii ghatnaayen keval tabhi hoti hai jab mahila samaaj main jaati he, agar mahila ghar se baahar na nikle to ye ghatnaayen nahin hongi
 However, soon after the speaker realized his mistake, he started saying that he is not against the education or work of women
 unhen padhanaa chahie, kaam karnaa chahie, kamaane kii aazaadee milani chahie lekin unki suraksha kaa dhyaan rakhaa janaa chahie
 It is worth noting that ten thousand women from across the country are participating in the three-day conference held in Amravati, which includes women mps, mlas, Businesswomen etc

 On Tuesday, the Yogi government in its cabinet decision made the government registration of all marriages compulsory and also fixed the limit for all new and old couples to register their marriages within a year
 yogi sarkaar ke is faisle ko amalijama pehanaane ke liye sabase pehle alpsankhyak rajyamantri mohsin raja saamne aae hai
 They will register their years old marriage by going to the registry office
 guuruuvaar subah mohsin raja apni patni ke saath registry offis jaakar iskaa panjikaran karaayenge
 With the registration of Mohsin Razke Nikah, new debate on this issue is also likely to intensify
 aisa isliye kaha ja rahaa he kyonki sarkaar kii is nai pahal ke tahat do patniyon kaa panjikaran nahin ho saktaa
 In such a situation when polygamy is not illegal within the minority community, it is therefore considered to be a debate on this issue
 sunni ulema firangi mahali ne sarkaar ke is faisle par sawaal uthaae hai or kaha he ki sarkaar ko aisa faisla lene ke pehle moulanaon or ulimaon se raay mashvira karnaa chahie tha
 The Yogi government has decided to link the registration of marriages with all government schemes so that the full details of husband and wife and family remain with the government in all government schemes
 sarkaar ne yah bhi tay kiya he ki sirf 10 rupee main shaadiyon kaa registration hoga or ek saal ke bheetar sabhi nae puraane dampattiyon ko chaahe ve kisi bhi majahab ko maanane vaale hon unhen apni shaadi kaa panjikaran karwaanaa hoga
 Those who will not do so will be different from all government schemes

 unhone june main hue maharajaganj loksabhaa seat ke upachunaav main apni party ko baari jeet dilaai lekin chaara ghotaale main doshi qaraar dene ke kaaran apni loksabhaa kii sadsyta gavaayin or ab agle 6 varshon tak chunaav bhi nahin lard paaenge
 After separating from Nitish, the BJP also took the status of the main opposition from the Rashtriya Janata Dal
 lekin raajnneeti or jindagi main kai baar nahin dikhne vaale or na ginane vaale kaarak zyada mahatvapurn hote hai
 In fact, 2013 has been the year of Lalu Prasad Yadav in Bihar politics
 2012 tak bihar main chunavi rajnatik asar main lalu apekshaakrit kamjor dikh rahe the haalanki maharajaganj ke pehle hue saare upachunaavon main bhi lalu ke maton main badhotaree dekhi gai thi parantu pichley varsh tak lalu endie ke peeche hi rahe
 But 2013 once again brought Lalu to the front line and RJD returned to Bihar politics
 lalu kii koshishon ne tab rang dikhaanaa shuru kiya jab patna main 15 may kii parivartan raily main baari bheed umadi
 On June 5, his candidate Prabhunath Singh, minister in the Nitish government in Maharajganj by-election P
W
 ke
 1 to the royal
 37 lakh voton se haraa diya
 This was a major step towards Lalu's return
 phir 16 june ko jab bijepi-jedy (you) gathbandhan tutaa to lalu kii vaapasi tay najar aane lagi or bahukoniya muqabla hona nishchit ho gaya
 He is going to benefit from this
 teen saal pehle, 2010 ke vidhansabha chunaav main argedy ne apana sabase kharaab pradarshan kiya tha
 The party had a total of 54 in the state
 66 lakh vot yani 18
 84 percent votes were received
 phir bhi yah bijepi ke 16
 46 per cent had more than votes and just 3 from JD (U)
 77 fisadi kam
 Lalu could benefit from the breakdown of the BJP-JD (U) alliance
 lalu ke virodhiyon kaa maananaa tha ki doshi qaraar dene se unki sthiti kamjor hogi, par ve pehle se zyada taqatvar hokar ubhare hai
 With the support he has received after the sentencing and bail, political experts believe that the 74-day jail has set the ground for Lalu's return
 jail jane se lalu ko sahanubhuti mili he
 But if he had been in jail for a few more months, this sympathy would have taken the form of worry and despair and political forces, especially the BJP, would have got a chance to break into Lalu's base
 lalu samay rahete jamaanat par jail se reeha ho gaye
 Lalu also made headlines in 2013
 saal kaa ant hote-hote sonia gandhi ne unhen phone karke rihaai par khushi jataai
 This is being seen as an indication that Lalu is the only leader who can take on Narendra Modi in Bihar
 ab congress or argedy kaa samjhauta hota najar aa rahaa he, jo nitish ke liye nishchit hi chintaa kaa sabab he

 a new text has been written in the politics of Uttar Pradesh
 loksabhaa chunaav 2019 ke liye sapa-basapa gathbandhan kii kavayad ke bich donon dalon ke netaa ek saath khadey najar aa rahe hai
 In the mood to clamp down on Akhilesh Yadav over the illegal mining case, the pain has started to be felt not only by the SP but also the BSP and the Congress
 yahi vajah he ki akhilesh ke bachaav main basapa ke mahasachiv satish chandra mishra or congress ke mahasachiv gulam nabi aaazaad khulkar khadey ho gaye hai
 For the first time in the history of SP-BSP since 1993, when trouble came over SP, the BSP has come forward as a shield
 sansad parisar main somvaar ko sapa ke mahasachiv ram gopal yadav or basapa ke satish chandra mishra ne ek saath bijepi par hamalaa bolaa
 At the same time, slavery prophet Azad from the Congress also stood in favor of Akhilesh and said that Modi is working to intimidate and threaten the agency by backing the anti-government parties
 ram gopal yadav ne kaha ki abhi SP-BSP kaa gathbandhan hua nahin he, usase pehle hi sarkaar ne sibiai ke tote ke saath gathbandhan kar liya he
 The CBI is being misused before the election at the behest of the central government
 samaajawaadee party or unke sahyogi agar sadak par aaenge to bijepi waalon kaa sadak par chalanaa mushkil ho jayega or modi ko banaras chhodkar duusari seat se chunaav ladanaa pad jayega
 BSP leader Satish Chandra Mishra defended Akhilesh, saying that the CBI was being misused to deviate from the issues
 bijepi kii hataasha kaa alam yah he ki modi sarkaar ne sibiai se gathbandhan kar liya he
 Today these people have demolished an institution like CBI
 congress ke rajyasabha saansad gulam nabi aaazaad ne bhi modi sarkaar par sibiai ke durupyog kaa aarope lagaate hue kaha ki yah pehali baar nahin ho rahaa he
 Today the leaders of the new party are on target, before that our leaders have also been targeted by misusing the agency
 unhone kaha ki chunaav se ain pehle paune 5 saal baad akhilesh yadav ke khilaaf yah karrwai shuru kii gai he taaki gathbandhan naa kiya jaae yaa gathbandhan jeet kaa kaaran naa bane
 The Modi government is working to intimidate many opposition parties including TMC, DMK, which the Congress Party condemns
 dilachasp baat ye he ki pichley 23 saalon ke dauraan basapa or sapa is tarah ek duusare ke liye khadi najar nahin ai hai
 This is the first time they have come together
 akhilesh paksh main basapa ke saath aane ke raajnneetik myne bhi he
 Before the announcement of the alliance, both the parties have indicated that now both parties are ready to fight for each other
 isse sapa-basapa ke party kaaryakartaaon ko bhi ek sandesh gaya he, jab netaa ek hai to kaaryakarta bhi ek hon
