 It is also being talked about in 2014
 china ne somvaar ko kaha he ki bharat agar newclear saplir group main shaamil hota he to use china ke hiton par koi asar nahin padataa he

 The Chinese spokesperson said one thing that does not eliminate the possibility, but such arrows keep moving in the world of diplomacy
 yah bhi samajhnaa chahie
 On the pretext of nuclear non-proliferation, India tries to make a little more effort
 china ke alaava turki or dakshin africa bhi maanate hai ki parmaanu aprasar sandhi par hastakshar kiye bina bharat ko enesji kii sadsyta nahin milani chahie
 But China, Turkey and South Africa approved civil nuclear business agreements in 2008 with 48 NSG member countries
 hamen yah bhi dhyaan rakhana chahie
 The US which China has cited has appealed for India's membership
 jab patrakaron ne white house ke pravaktaa se poocha ki kya america ne china se bharat ke bare main baat kii he to jawaab aayaa ki anya sadsy deshon se baat kii he
 It did not say that there was talk with China
 is jawaab se yah zaahir hota he ki america bharat ke liye anya deshon se baat kar rahaa he
 Is China talking to other countries for Pakistan or is making its move by making a public statement

 The comments da vir dot in website main andr small ne likhaa he ki is baar jaankaron ko lag rahaa he ki china ant tak apni raay nahin badalegaa
 Now the question is how far will China oppose
 enesji ke niyam ke tahat wo civillian newclear trade nahin kar saktaa, lekin tab bharat ko apwaad ke rup main chhot di gai thi
 Due to this, India can trade in terms of nuclear fuel and technology in a legal manner
 bharat ke akhabaaron main is masale par chape lekh padhenge to lagegaa ki china ke alaava kareeb-kareeb sabhi deshon ne samarthan kar diya he
 If you read Chinese newspapers, then most of the countries are opposing India
 newclear saplir group main bharat kii sadsyta kaa faisla june yaa july main nahin hone vaala he
 The Foreign Minister has also said that India will try to become a member by this year, but has India made Pakistan and Pakistan more restless with their activism
 in avarodhon se kya yah samajha jaae ki sadsyta mili to duniya ke kootnithik maanchitr par bharat kii sthiti 49wein mulk banane se kahin or zyaada majboot ho jayega
 There is something about which Pakistan is worried
 china baichaiyn he or bharat shant he
 Apart from the NSG, India has not connected any other wires, which we are not able to see
 2010 main jab amareeki raashtrapati bharat aae the tab bhi kaha tha ki ve enesji main bharat kii sadsyta kaa samarthan karenge
 In 2010 itself, French President Nicolas Sarkozy spoke of his support for the visit to India
 2014 main bhi baat ho rahi he
 China has said on Monday that if India joins the Nuclear Suppliers Group, it does not affect China's interests
 china kii tarah bharat bhi parmaanu aprasar or nirastrikaran kii vakaalat karata he or parmaanu hathiyaaron ke pehle istamaal na karne kii sandhi ko lekar patibaddh bhi he

 Formally, the Foreign Minister of India has said that India will try to seek China's support
 china enesji main bharat kii sadsyta kaa virodh nahin kar rahaa he
 He is only talking about the process

 The spokesperson said that India's membership of the Nuclear Suppliers Group's plenary conference in Seoul, South Korea's capital on June 23 and 24, is not on the agenda
 lekin unhone yah bhi kaha ki jin sadasyon ne parmaanu aprasar sandhi par hastakshar nahin kiye hai, enesji main unke liye darvaaze abhi bhi khule hai
 This issue could be discussed
 china kii pravaktaa ne ek aisi baat kah di jisase sambhaavnaaen khatm to nahin hoti hai, magar kootneeti kii duniya main is tarah ke tir chalate rahete hai
 It should also be understood
 parmaanu aprasar ke bahaane bharat ko thodi or mehnat karaane kii koshish lagati he
 Apart from China, Turkey and South Africa also believe that India should not get NSG membership without signing the Nuclear non-proliferation Treaty
 lekin china, turki or dakshin africa ne 2008 main enesji ke 48 sadsy deshon ke saath civil newclear kaarobaar ke samjhauton ko manzuri de di thi
 We should also take care of this
 china ne jin america kaa hawala diya he usne to bharat kii sadsyta kii apil kii he
 When reporters asked a White House spokesperson if the United States had talked to China about India, the reply came that it had talked to other member countries
 yah nahin kaha ki china se baat hui he
 This answer shows that America is talking to other countries for India
 kya china pakistan ke liye anya deshon se baat kar rahaa he yaa saarvajanik bayaan dekar apni chaal chal rahaa he
 Diplomatic matters should not be viewed just in terms of how the outcome is going to be
 is tarah bhi dekhiye ki nattejey ke pehle koun kiske liye kisi chaal chal rahaa he
 Pakistan's newspapers are also undergoing a lot of analysis of China's statements on the NSG issue
 vahaan ke pratishthit akhbaar don ne apane sampadakeey main likhaa he ki pakistan maanata rahaa he ki pakistan ke bina bharat ko sadsyta dene se donon deshon ke bich sainya parmaanu pratiyogita shuru ho jayega

 ab sawaal he ki china kahaan tak virodh karegaa
 Under the NSG rule, it cannot trade civilian nuclear, but India was then exempted as an exception

 In this fashion, Timur celebrated the first Diwali, Karismahama Lucky with Kareena is there to help us
 agar mujhe unke saath hameshaa rahanaa pade, to mujhe khushi nahin hogi
 In the second schedule of Veere Di Wedding, Kareena did not take Taimur
 us samay wo maayoos lagata tha, lekin ab karina waapas aa gai hai or taimur ab khush he
 The house seems balanced due to Kareena's energy

 com / kr1ylk6k1s— Simon Kruse (@crusoes)august 24, 2015 It has been almost eight years since Mahendra Singh Dhoni was captained, and it has been a long time while answering questions in front of the media about the team
 lagata he ki dhoni agar khilaadi nahin hote, to ek achche rajaneta ho sakate the, kyonki kisi bhi mudde par aap unase kabhi bhi sidhaa jawaab nahin hasil kar sakate or unke paas jitne shots hai, usase zyaada ek hi bahaane ko alag-alag shabdon ke dwaara kehane kii kala bhi he
 Although he will not become a politician after cricket, there is no guarantee
 tri siries main england kii team se do match lagaataar haarane ke baad or final kii res se baahar hone ke baad dhoni ne kaha he ki vah chaahate hai ki khilaadi apane kit-bag or cricket ke baaki saamaan ko taala laga den or cricket se puri tarah se brake le len
 The fact is that everyone needs a break, be it a player or a journalist, but who needs a break in this team? shikhar dhawan ke balle par to do maheene se ab jaakar gend lagani shuru hui thi ki captain ne brake kii baat kar di
 Rohit Sharma has a stretch in his muscles and is already resting
 eshanth sharma bhi pehle teen test match ke baad is daure par aaraam hi kar rahe hai
 Ravindra Jadeja has also become a part of the World Cup team while resting
 akshar patel to daure par sirf vanade ke liye gaye hai, yani aaraam kaa sawaal nahin hota to bhubaneshwar kumaar bhi lanbaa aaraam karke chot ke baad team main laute hai
 Suresh Raina played a total of four balls in the Sydney Test and he has 54 runs in odis too, now how much rest he should take for this
 shaayad captain dhoni media ke saamne dawaai to bataa gaye, lekin beemaari ko bataanaa bhul gaye
 Perhaps he forgot to say that this time he needed a break from the height of Virat Kohli and Ravi Shastri in the dressing room
 shaayad vah yah bataanaa bhul gaye ki dhoni ne jin jadeja, jin shikhar or jin raidu par saal bhar daanv lagaaya wo ab unhen niraash karne lage hai
 Perhaps he also forgot to say that if he could not reach Team India in the final of the World Cup, then it might be difficult for him to save his captaincy in odis
 in sabase unhen to brake chahie hi, australian daure par team india ko gaye hue do maheene se zyaada vakt ho gaya he, lekin abhi bhi team ko ek bhi jeet nahin mili he
 In Test matches, we have the pretext of defeat in foreign countries, but the fans have not been able to digest the ODI failure yet
 lekin in sab se beparwaah captain dhoni chaahate hai ki team ab kuch dinon tak apan kit-bag ko taala laga den or khud ko puri tarah cricket se dur kar den
 
 vaise dhoni akele nahin hai, jo aisi raay rakhte hai
 Former Team India captain Sourav Ganguly has even said that players who want to come to India and spend time with their family, they should get it
 tamaam aalochana ke baad bhi team india ke captain ko puraa bharosa he ki bharat jab 15 farvari ko pakistan ke khilaaf is worldcup kaa apana pehla muqabla khilne utrega to puri tarah taiyaar hoga
 The verdict has come in the 2010 Dhaula Kuan gang rape case in Delhi
 sabhi paanch aropiyon ko court ne doshi qaraar diya he
 These convicts will be sentenced in Dwarka Court on 17 October
 aapako bataa den ki adaalat ne 22 sitambar 2014 ko apana aadesh taal diya tha, kyonki ek aaropee osman urf kaale ke vakil amit shrivastav ne aarope lagaaya tha ki police ne use fansaane ke liye sabooton ke saath chhedchhad kii he
 The court sought a response from the prosecution on this
 sarkari vakil satvinder cor ne aaropee ke tark kaa virodh kiya or kaha ki saboot ke saath chhedchhad karne kii koi sambhaavna nahin thi, kyonki namoona ghatnasthal ke ek din baad hi forencik science laboratory bhej diya gaya tha or aaropee ko ek saptaah baad giraftaar kiya gaya tha
 Shamshad alias Khutkan, Usman alias Kale, Shahid alias Chhoti, Iqbal alias Bada Cat and Kamaruddin are under trial for kidnapping and gang-raping a 30-year-old woman in Dhaula Kuan area of south Delhi

 Significantly, the five kidnapped the woman belonging to the Northeast on November 24, 2010, while she was returning home from the office with a friend
 apharan ke baad aparankarta use mongolpuri le gaye, jahaan uske saath gangrape kiya gaya or uske baad ek sunsaan sadak par chhod diya
 The five were later arrested from Mewat in Haryana

 The reason for this is being attributed to the cold winds which allowed pollutants to gather in delhi-ncr
 mangalvaar ko dilli kaa air quality index 369 rahaa, jo gurugram se bhi badtar tha
 Gurugram's air quality index was recorded at 331
 ensiaar main gajiabad kaa pradarshan sabase kharaab najar aayaa kyonki vahaan kii akyuai 421 darj kii gai thi
 While AQI 395 was in Greater Noida and Noida
 dhimi hawa ne kharaab kii dilli kii hawagauratlab he ki rajdhani dilli main taapmaana bhi gir rahaa he
 When the mercury falls, the air becomes cold and heavy and does not allow pollutants to reach the ground
 iske alaava, shant hawaaon kii vajah se bhi dilli-ensiaar ke upar pradooshak tatv jamaa ho gaye hai
 The winds which were earlier blowing at a speed of 15-20 kmph are currently blowing at a speed of 5-8 kmph

 In some parts of the city, the Air Quality Index is going to touch the 'severe' category
 haalanki ummid kii ja rahi he ki halki barish kii bauchhaar or hawa kii gati main thodi vruddhi ke kaaran guuruuvaar ke baad maamuli raahat mil sakati he
 On Arvind Kejriwal's attack on Punjab's ruling Akali Dal on the issue of drugs, Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal retorted that the Chief Minister of Delhi is a desperate person who does not know the dignity of his post
 badal ne kaha ki kisi mukhyamantri kaa vaktavy jari karnaa shobhaa nahin detaa, jaisaa kejariwal ne pradhanmantri narendra modi or yahaan tak ki akali netritv ke khilaaf jari kiya he
 Badal told reporters on the sidelines of his 'sangat Darshan' program in Bahadur assembly constituency that the nonsensical and baseless allegations made by Kejriwal without any evidence reflected the hollowness of his personality
 unhone kaha, 'apane puure jivan main main naitikta kaa samarthak rahaa hum or meraa dridhtaa se maananaa he ki kejariwal ko sirf number badhaane ke liye is tarah kaa bayaan jari karne se bachanaa chahie
 ' kejariwal ne isse pehle rajya ke rajasav mantri bikram singh majithia dwaara daayar manahani ke maamle main jamaanat milane ke baad aaj punjab sarkaar par hamalaa kiya tha
 Kejriwal, while reiterating his allegations against Majithia, had said that Punjab is in a bad state due to drugs
 majithia rajya ke up mukhyamantri sukhbir singh badal ke rishtedaar hai
 The comments badal ne daawa kiya ki apni janonmukhi nitiyon kii vajah se shiad-bijepi gathbandhan rajya main satta main lautegi
 Badal said, 'punjab Congress chief Captain Amarinder Singh and Kejriwal should give up the dream of coming to power in the state, as people will express confidence in the evolutionary and welfare policies of the ruling coalition
 ' bijepi ke purv saansad navjot singh siddhu ke aam aadmi party main shaamil hone kii sambhaavna se jude sawaal par mukhyamantri ne kaha ki iskaa shaayad hi koi asar padegaa

 Majithia is a relative of Sukhbir Singh Badal, Deputy Chief Minister of the state
 tippaniyan Badal claimed that the SAD-BJP alliance would return to power in the state due to its people-oriented policies
 badal ne kaha, 'punjab congress pramukh captain amarinder singh or kejariwal ko rajya main satta main aane kaa sapana chhod dena chahie, kyonki log sattarudh gathbandhan kii vikasvaadi or kalyankari nitiyon main vishwaas vyakt karenge
 On the question related to the possibility of former BJP MP Navjot Singh Sidhu joining the Aam Aadmi Party, the Chief Minister said that it would hardly have any effect

 com / amzokbym36— Wimbledon (@wimbledon)july 16, 2017 13 out of 20 of a Hemuslim family have converted to Hinduism in order to get justice in the death of a member of a house that took place three months ago in Niwada village of Uttar Pradesh's Baghpat district
 is parivaar ke baaki saat logon nedharm parivartananheen kiya he
 They say that religion is change due to police harassment and neglect of own Muslim society
 mangalvaar ko dharm parivartan kii rasm ke dauraan jai shriram or har har mahadev ke jayakaare khub lage
 Vande Mataram was also sung during this period
 dilachasp baat yah he ki is kaarykram se police or prashasanne duuri banaae rakhaa
 Earlier on Monday, the paperwork was completed
 havan-pujan se pehle vedi banaai gai, navagraha kii puja archana karai gai or phir tilak kar havan shuru karaayaa gaya
 After this, the program of conversion was completed
 kya he puraa maamalabadarkhaa gaanv nivasee akhtar ali 15 farvari 2018 ko apanagaanvchhodakar 5 kilometre dur niwada gaanv jaakar rahane lage the
 The first Akhtar Ali and now Dharam Singh's son Gulhassan died on July 22 in Niwada village of Baghpat
 shav faansee ke fande se lataka mila
 Family members met the police for the revelation of the murder, but it is alleged that the police made the murder a suicide
 iske baad peedit parivaar ne thane ke khub chakkar kaate, lekin insaaf nahin mila
 There was also a Panchayat of Muslim community about this, but they were also abused there
 police pratadna or muslim samaaj se madad na milane ke chalate is parivaar ke sadasyon ne hindu dharm apnaane kaa faisla kar liya
 He has given affidavit to SDM of Barot in this regard
 iske baad waapas apane gaanv main badarkhaa main aakar dharm parivartan kar liya
 The 13 members of the Muslim family adopted these 13 members of the Hindu dharm-muslim family and changed their name along with adopting Hindu religion
 akhtar ali kaa naam badalakar dharm singh ho gaya or unke bete dilashaad se diler singh, naushaad se narendra or irshaad se kavi ban gaye
 Among those who converted, they also included their wives, two grandchildren and four granddaughters
 yuva hindu vahini ne bataaya ghar vaapasiye puraa kaarykram yuva hindu vahini bharat ke sahyog se sampann hua
 In the case, Yogendra Tomar, the District President of the Young Hindu Vahini, says that these people have returned home
 maamle par police prashasan khamoshis kaarykram se police or prashashan ne duuri banaae rakhi
 When the program ended, Prasad was also distributed
 puraa gaanv is dharm parivartan kaarykram kaa gavaah bana
 Now the question here is, will this family get justice from the conversion? 'ye kaisaa idia le aae tum british raaj ke gaanvvaale or cricket? kisi or produsar ko suna bhi mat dena ise
 i am not interested in Idea playing this revenue and playing cricket

 He also said that it is unfortunate for the Election Commission to do so
 It is unfortunate that EC is not concerned about the institution's neutrality & that is why our Karyakartas have to embark on a Satyagraha
 - Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) May 8, 2014 According to the permission of the rally in security chalk Chaubandkaval Rohanian, on April 5, the party had applied for approval of these programs of Modi
 lekin aarope he ki jiladhikari pranjal yadav bijepi ke aavedan par kundali markar baithe rahe
 Later when the ruckus erupted, the District Magistrate cleared the rest of the programs except the rally in Beniabagh
 lekin, bijepi ke mutabik tab tak uske paas itnaa vakt nahin bachaa ki wo in kaaryakramon ko kar sake
 Therefore, the party itself canceled all of Modi's programs at his level
 ab modi aaj sirf rohaniyaan main raily karenge, jisaki manjuuri pehle mil chuki thi

 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he) The Congress dismissed the reports that Pawan Kumar Bansal and Ashwini Kumar were removed from the Union Cabinet as a 'joint decision' of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and party president Sonia Gandhi, saying the action was taken at the insistence of the party president
 party mahasachiv janardan dvivedi ne kaha, ‘media main yah samachar aayaa he ki congress adhyaksh ke jor dene par kendriya mantrimandal se do mantriyon ke istife hue
 it is not true
 vaastavik sthiti yah he ki yah pradhanmantri or congress adhyaksh kaa sanyukt nirnay tha
 He said, 'the truth is that it was a joint decision of Congress President and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh
 ’congress ke media vibhaag ke pramukh dvivedi kaa yah bayaan isliye mahatvapurn he kyonki kuch aisi khabaren aayi thim jinase lag rahaa tha ki congress adhyaksh dwaara bansal or kumaar ke padon par bane rahane par naaraazgi jaahir kiye jane ke baad shuukravaar ko pradhanmantri ne apane kareebi samajhe jane vaale donon cabinet mantriyon bansal or kumaar ko istipha dene ko kaha
 Targeting the Prime Minister about these reports, senior BJP leader LK Advani had said, 'has the Prime Minister even relinquished his right to decide about his cabinet? Today's news regarding the removal of two ministers is generally emphasizing that it is Soniaji who has removed 'two PM men'
 ’ adwani ne apane blog par likhaa, ‘atmasamman kaa takaza he ki pradhanmantri samay purv aam chunaav kaa aadesh den
 Reports said that Sonia Gandhi had a meeting with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the Congress president is understood to have expressed the party's unease over the concept being created among the public for not taking action against Railway Minister Bansal and Law Minister Kumar

 Kumar, on the other hand, relinquished the controversy over the controversy arising out of interference in the CBI report in the coal block allocation scam

 During this time, the opposition stood firm on the demand for the resignation of the Prime Minister and the removal of the Law Minister
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne kaha he ki wo desh main teji se vikaas chaahate hai
 For this, there is a need to change the working style of the government, only then the country will change
 modi ne niti ayog ke transforming india ke program main kaha ki bahut si aisi chizon ko badalanaa hoga jo ab prasangik nahin he
 Talking about the law, Modi said that there are many such laws in our country
 jo ab praasangik nahin he unhen badalane kii jarurat he
 There should be rapid development in the country: Modi Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that 'we want the country to grow fast and not slowly but now we are in the 21st century and not the 19th century

 The saying is broken in color is old, but something similar happened with the New Delhi Municipal Council ie NDMC
 darasal, kareeb sava saal pehle endiemasi ne apane ilaake kii sadakon ke divyder or donon kinaaron ko ujala, kaala or pile kii jagah duusare rangon se potai kar di

 After the swearing-in ceremony of the Modi government, the politics of Bihar has changed quite rapidly
 modi mantrimandal main jediu kaa koi mantri shaamil nahin hua kyonki mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne ek mantri banaae jane ko sankethik bataaya or faisla kiya ki bhavishya main bhi centre sarkaar main jediu kaa koi mantri hissaa nahin legaa
 Soon after, the cabinet expanded in Bihar with 8 JDU leaders being made ministers, while no BJP MLA was included
 ab bihar main iftaar kii raajnneeti chal padi he jisamen bijepi-jediu gathbandhan main sabakuch thik nahin dikh rahaa
 Here different parties are doing Iftar, in which the politics of anti-coalition is also seen rising
 kai netaa bhale in aayojanon ko raajnneeti se alag bataa rahe hon lekin agle saal hone vaale bihar vidhansabha chunaav ko lekar is baar kii iftaar party kuch alag jarur he
 Like last year, iftar was organized at the residence of former Chief Minister Rabri Devi this time in which many leaders of the grand alliance were seen
 isamen chaunkaane vaali baat ye rahi ki rabari devi ke chote bete tejasvi yadav nahin dikhe jinke netritv main argedy is baar loksabhaa chunaav ladi or use karaari haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 However, in this iftar, Tej Pratap Yadav, the eldest son of Rabri Devi, was seen who was engaged in the hospitality of the people
 iftaar main rabari devi ke hawaale se ek bayaan yah aayaa ki mahagathbandhan main agar phir se nitish kumaar shaamil hote hai to unhen koi etraj nahin he
 Here, JDU, which is running the government with the support of BJP in Bihar, also gave an iftar party on Sunday, in which former Chief Minister and Hindustani Awam Morcha (hum) chief Jitan Ram Manjhi did join but no BJP leader or MLA reached
 isse kai sawaalon ko bal mila, bijepi ke netaa bhale hi iskaa raajnneetik matlab na nikaale jane kii baat kah rahe hon lekin rishton main 'talkhi' jarur dikh rahi he
 On the other hand, contrary to the statements of the BJP leader, Congress leader Premchand Mishra said that BJP and JDU not going to each other's iftar party is clarifying the position of NDA
 ekataraf jediu kii iftaar party main bijepi netaaon kaa na janaa or duusari ore rabari devi kaa yah bayaan ki nitish kumaar mahagathbandhan main phir shaamil hote hai to unhen etraj nahin, iske kai siyaasi myne nikaale ja rahe hai
 There is a news in the political corridors that there is an assembly election next year in which JDU and RJD alliances are possible
 is tark ko majbootee dene ke liye log raghuvansh prasad singh ke bayaan ko bhi dekh rahe hai jisamen unhone kaha ki tejasvi yadav ne likhit rup main yah thode na diya he ki nitish kumaar mahagathbandhan main shaamil nahin ho sakate
 Raghuvansh Singh has also said that all parties should come together to defeat BJP
 gauratlab he ki jediu or bijepi ke bich talkhi kii shuruyaat tab shuru hui, jab narendra modi ke mantrimandal ke shapath grahan samaaroh ke kuch ghante pehle mukhyamantri ne jediu ko shaamil karne se manaa kar diya
 Nitish Kumar termed the nomination of only one minister by the NDA as symbolic participation and announced not to join the cabinet, rejecting the bjp's proposal
 iske do din baad hi bihar main nitish kumaar ne apane mantrimandal kaa vistaar kiya, jisamen bijepi ke ek bhi vidhayak ko shaamil nahin kiya gaya
 JDU then made it clear that in future also it will not be a part of Modi government
 baharhaal, ramajaan main bihar main jo siyaasi tasviir ubhar rahi he, uskaa sanket partiyon ke paala badalane kaa he jisamen nitish kumaar kis dhade se judenge, abhi yah saaf nahin he
 However, from JDU to BJP it is seen that their alliance is strong and they will continue to be a part of NDA even further
 loksabhaa chunaav khatm ho gaye hai, agsit pole bhi aa chuke hai or nattejey aane main 24 ghante se bhi kam vakt bachaa he
 Nearly all exit polls show the NDA getting a majority and all have predicted that Narendra Modi is going to form the government for the second time
 india today data intelligence unit ne 20 aisi siton kaa vishleshan kiya, jis par aisi partiyon kaa chunaav kiya gaya, jinhone pichhali 5 loksabhaa chunaavon ke baad sarkaar banaai, isliye ham aisi siton ko trend setting seat kah rahe hai
 If the current exit polls are correct, then this time, there are 5 such seats in the survey conducted after the election which may lose the mark of setting the trend
 dakshin bharat kaa prabhavamjedaar baat he ki ye paanchon siten dakshin bharat kii hai jo is baar trend set karne se chook rahi hai or satta main aane vaali party kaa chunaav nahin kar rahi hai
 Of these, three seats are from Andhra Pradesh (kakinada, Amalapuram and Rajahmundry), one from Tamil Nadu (dharampuri) and one from Telangana (secunderabad)
 2014 main andhra kii teenon siten chandrababu naidu kii telegu desham party ne jiti thim
 Telugu Desam had a pre-poll alliance with the BJP, but in March 2018 it exited the NDA
 tidipi kaa aarope tha ki modi sarkaar ne rajya ko vishesh darja dene ke liye kuch nahin kiya
 According to India today-axis My India exit poll, Jagan Mohan Reddy's party YSR Congress is winning from Kakinada, Amalapuram and Rajahmundry
 agar agsit pole sahi hue to jagan kaa kisi bhi party ke saath chunaav purv gathbandhan nahin he isliye in siton par se trend setting kaa tamgaa chhin saktaa he
 bjp's Bandaru Dattatreya MP is currently on the seat of Secunderabad and according to exit poll this seat is going to TRS
 ke chandrashekhar raav ke netritv vaali tiares ne pichley vidhansabha chunaavon main shandaar pradarshan kiya tha
 The party won 88 of the 119 assembly seats
 tiares ne 2014 main bhi bijepi ke saath koi gathbandhan nahin kiya tha or is baar bhi wo akeli lard rahi he
 In the exit poll, this seat is seen going to the TRS account, so the trend of trend setting can also be removed from this seat
 
 The last seat is Dharampuri in Tamil Nadu
 haalanki agsit pole main yahaan diemke or bijepi kii sahyogi piemke ke bich kadi takkar kaa anumaan jataayaa gaya he
 DMK has fielded 41-year-old DNV Senthil Kumar s from here, while he is pitted against pmk's Abumani Ramdoss
 15 trend setting siton par bijepi kii jeet tay?agsit pole data ke mutabik 20 trend setting siton main se 15 siton par bijepi or unki sahyogi partiyon ko jeetne main koi khaas pareshaani nahin hone ja rahi he
 For instance, since 1977, the party whose government has been winning the Valsad seat of Gujarat has been winning since 1977
 ye seat anusuchit janajati ke liye arakshit he
 Although there is a tough fight between BJP and Congress in this seat, BJP has been shown to take the lead in exit polls
 yahaan maujuuda bijepi saansad ke si patel or kaparada se 4 baar ke congress vidhayak jitu bhai choudhary ke bich ladaai he
 Other trend-setting seats are also named North Mumbai, where famous actress Urmila Matondkar is trying her luck on a Congress ticket, but according to exit polls her defeat is certain
 vahiin purvi dilli kii seat par aap kii aatishi chunaav maidan main hai jo bijepi ke star pratyaashee gautam gambhir ke khilaaf chunaav haar sakati hai
 Apart from this, BJP and their allies are winning in all the trend setting seats of Bihar, Gujarat, Haryana, Jharkhand, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu Kashmir and Maharashtra in exit polls
 lekin aakhri nateezon kaa sabko intjaar he

 com / 1qbzcb3dca kuch ghatnaon ne duniya ko badalakar rakh diya
 One of the biggest incidents of this is the 2001 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center in New York
 america par hue is hamale kii kahani ko centre main rakhkar ab tak kai kitaab, lekh, documentry or filmein banaai ja chuki hai
 Every time an attempt has been made to find the reasons behind the attack through imagination and facts
 ab is ghatana ke kai saalon baad ek web series main duniya ke sabase daraavne khaufnak aatanki hamale ke peeche kii vajahon or galatiyon ko talasha gaya he
 The title of the web series that is being talked about is "the Looming Tower"
 is siries ne haal hi main Emmy Awards main kai khitaab apane naam kiye hai
 What is the story of the looming tower? The American network company Hulu created this series about the 9 / 11 attacks
 mashhoor lekhak Lawrence Wright kii kitaab The Looming Tower se prabhavit hokar siries banaai gai he
 This series of 10 episodes tells where the real story of 9 / 11 actually begins
 puri kahani american khufia agency CIA or suraksha agency FBI ke bich chal rahi politics ke bich buni gai he
 The anti-terrorism Unit of the FBI is aware of some big plans of the terrorists about 8-10 years before the attack, but the CIA does not give them any information just because they think that they will be able to get the information
 FBI kii team lagaataar south asia main in chizon par kaam karti he
 Meanwhile, attacks on the American High Commission in Afghanistan, Libya and African countries take place
 chaanbin aage badhati he or taar sidhe "alqaida" se judate hai
 Al Qaeda constantly threatens retaliation from the US, meanwhile two Saudi citizens are trained and sent to the US
 alqaida do se teen saal pehle hi apane aatankiyon ko america main entry karvaa detaa he
 With complete planning
 duusari taraf siie or epabiai sabakuch jaanate hue bhi aatankiyon ke plan naakaam karne main fail ho jate hai
 And when the FBI chief loses his job and becomes the security chief of the World Trade Center, Al Qaeda strikes there the very next day
 baaki kii baaten ab ek dardanaak itihaas hai
 Why this series is special? So far, many types of films have been seen on the issue of 9 / 11
 zyaadaatar filmon main 9 / 11 ke din kya hua or phir america ne laden ko kis tarah khatm kiya, sirf ye hi dikhaaya jaataa he
 Probably for the first time in this series, an attempt has been made to show how in a mutual fight between the CIA and FBI, a big country like America was compromised by its security
 is hamale kii taiyaari aatanki kis tarah kar rahe the or america kaise galatiyon par galtiyaan karata ja rahaa tha, siries main ise dekhnaa dilachasp he
 This series also emphasizes the establishment that if the CIA and FBI were not caught in a mutual quarrel, then the internal security of America would not have seen a terrorist break
 ye series angreji main he
 In view of this, many times listen to dialogues in Lebanon, Persian and Urdu
 bhashaa kii ye dikkat kahani kii kasaavat angreji sabatitals kii vajah se baari nahin lagati
 However, people who have seen many stories on 9 / 11 can also bore its story
 puri siries 2-3 ahm kirdaaron ke ird-gird hi gumti he
 The most prominent is John o'neill who heads the fbi's Anti Terrorism Unit
 jon kaa kirdaar Jeff Daniels ne nibhaayaa he, isse pehle aap unhen The Newsroom jaisi tivi siries main dekh chuke hai
 Apart from him, the other important character is his assistant Ali Soufan
 is kirdaar ko Tahar Rahim ne nibhaayaa he
 His acting is quite spectacular and he has played the character of an american-muslim in a lively manner
 inke alaava aapako Wrenn Schmidt, Bill Camp, Louis Cancelmi kaa kaam bhi pasand aayega
 Where can i see? Well this original series is made by Hulu
 Hulu ke alaava bharat main ye Amazon Prime Video par dekha ja saktaa he

 After the implementation of GST in the entire country from July 1, what will be the effect on selling old gold jewelery to make money or new jewelery? Considering the importance of gold jewelery in India, there are many people who are troubled by rumors that if they want to sell old gold jewelery now, then they will be taken under the purview of GST
 is afvaah kaa asar sona kaarobaariyon par bhi pad rahaa he
 After the implementation of GST, there will be a levy of 3% GST on gold and 5% on jewelery making charge
 graahakon or dukandaaron main dar tha ki jeweler ko puraani jewelery graahak se kharidne par 3 fisadi kii dar se jiesti vasuulana hoga
 Also read: Money is black or white, gold is the best friend of both, if a customer sells old jewelery worth Rs 1 lakh, then Rs 3,000 will be deducted as GST at the rate of 3% from that transaction
 isse prati tranjaction graahakon ko apane sone ke badale kam keemat milegi
 But, considering the importance of old gold jewelery in the country, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has clarified that it is rumored that some kind of GST will be imposed on selling old gold jewelery
 jetali ne logon kii sone ke prati prem ko dekhte hue kaha ki puraani jewelery par sijisti act, 2017 kaa section 9(4) nahin lagegaa
 ALSO READ: Myth will break in 2017 'gold is not forever', so the finance minister is clear that the jewelery traders will not have to collect any tax from customers for old jewelery as this transaction will be out of GST
 gauratlab he ki vitt mantri ko is mudde par safai isliye deni padi kyonki ek din pehle revenue secretary hasmukh adhiya ne jiesti samajhaate hue kaha tha ki puraani jewelery kharidne par jewalers ko 3 fisadi tex dena hoga
 However, Jaitley said that jewelers cannot take advantage of this rebate given on this old jewelery, hence safety net has been used on this transaction
 jetali ne bataaya ki yadi koi aisa sone kii jewelery kaa saplir jiskaa registration nahin hua he or vah ek registerd saplir ko jewelery bechata he to use 3 fisadi kii dar se reverse charge maikenism ke mad main jiesti kaa bhugtan karnaa hoga

 In recent times, the conflict between the Congress high command and Himachal Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh has been well known
 virbhadra ne nae prabharee mahasachiv susheel kumaar scindia kii rajya main apane virdohi netaaon se mulaakaat ko lekar aisa morcha kholaa ki, sonia gandhi rahul gandhi or ahamed patel ko khat likh daalaa jisase vivaad khadaa ho gaya
 Virbhadra Singh wrote clearly in the letter that if the state president Sukhwinder Singh Sukhu is not removed, he will neither contest the election nor fight the party
 iske baad congress ke kheme main halchal paidaa hona laazmi tha
 According to the sources, Himachal general secretary in-charge Sushil Kumar Shinde was then entrusted with the responsibility to overcome the mutual factionalism and estrangement of the Himachal Congress, after which the formula suggested by Shinde after talking to all the parties was with Aaj Tak is
 yah hoga formulayah vah formula he, jis par congress alaakaman apni sahmati de chukaa he
 Whether Rahul or Soniaia, then Sonia's secretary Ahmed Patel, everyone believes that Virbhadra is our strongest leader in Himachal, but it is not right to challenge the Congress high command to remove the president, after which Shinde has prepared the formula which is today Up to formule ke mutabik, virbhadra singh himachal main congress kaa sabase bada cheharaa hai or vahi congress party kaa chunavi cheharaa honge virbhadra singh hi man mutabik zyada se zyada tikat baatenge jisaki hari jhandi alaakaman ke sanket par scindia ne virbhadra ko de di he
 State President Sukhu and Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh will be on the stage together in the program to be held in Himachal on early 28th, which will send a message to the Congress that, everything is going well i
e
 if Virabhadra is being agreed, but with conditions No
 yani chunaav main cheharaa virbhadra, tikat bantwaare main unako ahmiyat, lekin chunaav ke dedh maheene pehle sukkhu ko nahin hataanaa behatar
 According to sources, soon after everything is finalized, the in-charge Shinde will finalize the agreement between Virbhadra Singh and Sukhu and then meet Sonia Rahul with the two
 iske saath hi party ko aas he ki himachal congress kii ladaai shanti daur main pahunch jaaegi
 It is the effort of Congress that this time the fight should not be Congress vs Congress, Congress vs BJP
 is puri siyasat main himachal congress ke vah netaa jo rashtriya raajnneeti main dakhal rakhte hai unako bhi scindia ne manaa liya he
 He has also been promised a dozen tickets, that is Anand Sharma, who holds a figure of 36 from Virbhadra, who is considered to be the strength of Sukku
 kul milakar philhalapunjab keamrinder kii tarah taaqat dekar party himachal main virbhadra ko taaqat dene ko taiyaar he, lekin alaakaman dabaav main jhukaa nahin, isliye sukkhu ko hataane kaa sawaal nahin
 However, the situation within the organization of the party may claim to be the party, but the success will be only on keeping the sentiments of the people of Himachal

 uskaa guzaara mushkil se hota he
 He earns a hundred-two hundred rupees daily by wages
 kaaphi tangi main jivan yaapan ke baavjood aabid ko jab rasta chalate ek bag main 1,17,000 rupee mili, to usne duusare hi din vah paise police ke supurd kar die
 Abid Qureshi reached the police commissioner's office
 usne vahaan kahai ki "shaam 4 baje mujhe yah paisa mila raste main mila
 We sat till ten o'clock in the night that someone would come, but if no one came, i went home
 ab main yahaan dene aayaa hoon yah paise
 How do we keep it, we have to give it back
 " Abid remained sitting till 10 in the night at the Chaura Rasta market in Jaipur, where he received money
 usne sochaa ki shaayad jisane paise giraae hai vah vahaan dhundta hua aa jayega
 When he reached home at night, his wife Amina also said that return the money
 tippaniyan When the reporters questioned the said couple, if you kept the money, nobody would even know
 aapane aisa kyon kiya? to aabid kii patni ameena bano ne kaha "kyon rakh lete, hamen to aisa sikhaaya hi nahin he ki ham rakh len
 Bread of honesty and chutney is enough for us
 ham paise waapas dena chaahate hai

 In this world of corruption, such people would rarely come before them
 unhone kaha "yah bahut acha he
 This man walks a rickshaw, a jam, and if such a man incurs a lakh rupees and hands it over to the police, it is a commendable compliment
 " Abid and Ameena's many needs could be met with one lakh rupees
 bacchon kii padhai , beti kii shaadi kaa kharch vagairah
 But this honest man did not even approve a single penny, which he does not deserve
 aabid kuraishi police kamisionar ke daftar pahunchaa

 ise ham kaise rakh lete, hamen to waapas dena he
 " aabid raat main 10 baje tak vahiin jaipur ke chaura rasta bazaar main baitha rahaa, jahaan use paise mili the
 He thought that maybe the one who dropped the money would come looking for him there
 vah raat main jab ghar pahunchaa to uski bivi ameena kaa bhi yahi kahana tha ki paise lautaa do
 The comments patrakaron ne jab ukt danpati se sawaal kiya ki agar aap paise rakh lete to kisi ko pataa bhi nahin chalata

 Children's education, daughter's wedding expenses, etc
 lekin is eemaandaar shaks ko aisa ek paisa bhi manjuur nahin hua, jis par uskaa haq na ho

 eggzet pole se pehle chunaav ayog kii website par jaakar matdaan kaa pratishat bhi dekhie
 There are also many short stories
 2014 ke chunaav main madhya pradesh kii sabhi das reserve siton par jitna matdaan hua tha usase kahin zyada 2019 main matdaan hua he
 Research by Bani Bedi states that the vote percentage in the reserved ten seats for Scheduled Tribes and Castes in Madhya Pradesh has been more than ten percent on average
 yani 2014 kii tulana main is baar 10 pratishat adhik vot pade hai
 Bani has taken this data from the website of the Chief Electoral Officer of Madhya Pradesh
 aap bhi check kar sakate hai

 Rahul Gandhi has held 8 reserve seats in Madhya Pradesh

 Rahul Gandhi has also held a meeting in Khargone
 amit shah ne bhi inamen se kuch siton par sabha kii he
 These are all reserve seats
 kahin in siton par modi lahar to nahin chal rahi thi
 After all, ten percent more voting has taken place, there must have been some reason behind it
 ek do nahin balki das kii das reserve siton par matdaan pratishat 2014 kii tulana main 10 pratishat adhik hua he
 Madhya Pradesh has an average turnout of 70 on non-reserved CT in 2019
 01 pratishat hua he
 Average voter turnout of 73 seats in Madhya Pradesh in 2019
 45 pratishat hua he
 The Reserve seats have polled more than 3 percent compared to non-reserve seats
 yahaan kii gair arakshit siton par 2014 kii tulana main 8
 The turnout was 65 percent
 reserve siton par 2014 kii tulana main is baar 11
 The turnout was 15 percent
 kya ye wo ilaake hai jahaan log sarkari yojanaon se mili laabh kaa asar dekh ja rahaa he yaa yahaan par congress ne kuch mehnat kii he
 But why have there been more turnout in the Reserve seats of Bihar and UP
 2014 main bijepi ne upi kii sabhi reserve siton par bijepi jiti thi
 The average polling in up's 17 reserve seats is close to the average polling in the entire state
 2019 main reserve siton par matdaan kaa ausat he 58

 2014 kii tulana main yahaan 1
 45 percent point is more
 anusuchit jati ke desh bhar 84 siten arakshit hai or anusuchit janajati ke liye 47 siten arakshit hai
 The sum of both is 131 seats
 maharashtra main 5 reserve siten hai
 Four of these are scheduled castes and one is a tribe
 yahaan par 2014 ke jaisaa hi is baar ausat matdaan rahaa he
 But in Bihar, polling in reserve seats has been higher than the state's average turnout
 bihar main chah reserve siten hai
 Sushil Mahapatra looked at Bihar's data and found that 57 in 2019 in Hajipur
 72 pratishat vot padaa he

 91 pratishat tha
 Gaya has 56 percent of the vote in 2019, 53 in 2014

 72 pratishat vot padaa tha
 60 in 2019 in Samastipur

 upi or maharashtra kii rigerv siton par alag trend he,yaa to kam he yaa pichhali baar ke jaisaa he magar bihar or madhya pradesh kii rigerv siton par matdaan kaa trend kaaphi alag he
 Much more than before
 jharkhand main bhi yahi trend rahaa he
 See that this time the percentage of voting in rural areas is much better than in cities
 shahari kshetron main matdaan kaa pratishat kahi 2 pratishat kam hua he to dilli jaise mahanagar main 5 pratishat kam hua he
 By the way, this time there has been the highest turnout after independence
 66
 44 percent
 in aankadon main abhi or jod ghataav hona baaki he
 Election Commission data says that 66 in 2014
 44 pratishat matdaan hua tha
 This time, women voters have voted more and have reduced their difference significantly from the voting of men
 shahari kshetron main matdaan kam hua he
 In the first phase there were 87 urban seats out of which BJP won 55
 aadhe se adhik shahari siton par matdaan is baar kam rahaa he
 Now come in the exit poll of UP
 yahaan bijepi ko 30 se 68 siton ke milane kii bhavishyavaanee kii gai he alag alag survey main
 The News x leader has given 33 seats to the BJP
 abeepi news nelson ke eggzet pole main bijepi ko 33 siten mili hai
 Website anthro
 ai ne bijepi ko 31-30 ke range main siten di hai
 News24 Chanakya has given 65 seats to BJP
 ajtak exis maai india ne 62-68 siten di hai
 In the 7 exit polls, the Grand Alliance and Congress have got fewer seats than BJP
 antro
 ai has won 46-54 seats to the Grand Alliance
 sabase kam aaj tak chanakya ne 13 siten di hai
 Why is there such a difference? kya ise alag se samajhnaa zaruri nahin he
 How can it be that the big picture will be the same but different states have different trends
 rajyon ke str par agsit pole alag-alag tasviir kyon pesh kar rahe hai
 a poll in UP says the BJP will get 15-20 seats, a poll says that the Mahagathbandhan will get 38-40 seats and the third poll says that the BJP gets more than 65 seats
 teen pole ke nateezon main itnaa antar kyon hota he
 It has become a game of possibilities
 lekin itnaa antar aana nahin chahie
 If everyone's data is correct
 kya data main koi samasya he
 Either the exit poll was not done properly or the data was later changed
 kerala, bengal tamilnadu, andhra pradesh or odisha ke alag-alag survey ke nattejey aisi tasviir pesh kar ulajhaa dete hai
 But BJP believes that youth have risen above caste and voted for BJP
 har kisi vidwaanon ke bich yah sahmati he ki siton kii sankhya bhale aage peeche ho jaae magar jo trend he vah narendra modi kii sarkaar banane kii disha main he
 BJP leaders are excited about the exit poll
 vipaksh ke netaa agsit pole ko abhi tak khaarij kar rahe hai
 NCP leader Sharad Pawar has said that there has been an increase in anxiety among the people after the exit poll
 agsit pole sirf ek nautanki he
 In Maharashtra, BJP Shiv Sena has got 38-42 seats in exit poll, according to the Axis My India survey
 republic tivi si voter or kai agsit pole ne 34 kaa aankada diya he
 bjp's Shiv Sena is ahead in 48 seats in Maharashtra
 trinmul congress ne chunaav ayog ko patr likhaa he ki pradhanmantri modi kii kedarnath yatra kaa prasaaran aachaar samhita kaa ulanghan he
 How the channels broadcast it
 eggzet pole par bijepi or vipaksh ke netaaon ke bayaan alag-alag hai
 BJP says that the experiment like grand alliance has failed
 eggzet pole aane ke baad share bazaar main itnaa oochaal kaise aa gaya
 If there is a game of making money there, then you should also pay attention there
 agsit pole vaale bhi pataa chalaa ki udhar hi biji hai
 Today, why did the Sensex and Nifty soar
 oochaal kaa to ricard hi ban gaya
 The Cessanx jumped 1422 points to close at 39353

 This is the highest jump since 18 May 2009
 sensex main 5 lakh karod kii puunji jud gai or nifti main 43 hazaar karod kii puunji jud gai
 Market experts are saying that there has been a jump due to the withdrawal of NDA
 adani kii company ke sheyaron ke daam main 17 pratishat kaa oochaal aayaa or esbiai, tata motors, yas bank ke sheyaron main bhi 7 pratishat kaa oochaal aayaa
 On the other hand, political party leaders have started moving from here to there

 vipakshi partiyaan iviem ko lekar apni chintaaen zaahir karne ke liye mangalvaar ko dilli main chunaav ayog se milane ja rahi hai
 The opposition has been demanding that at least 50% of VVPAT slips be counted, but this demand has been rejected by the Supreme Court
 isaki jagah supreme court ne aadesh diya he ki prati vidhansabha kshetra ek iviem ke bajaay paanch iviem par vivipat kii slips kii ginati kii jaae
 Now the Opposition says that if there is a glitch in the constituency falling under a Lok Sabha constituency, then all the VVPAT slips should be counted there

 After the meeting, Akhilesh Yadav said that i follow my stand
 mahagathbandhan upi main 56 siton par jeet rahaa he or ab ham 23 may ko nateezon ke baad baat karenge
 This means that both parties have planned to stay out of the meeting called by UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi on the day of the results
 ye bhi kaha ja rahaa he ki nattejey saafe hone tak mayawati kii congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi se milane kii yojana nahin he

 In such a situation, the political innings of the state are also climbing fast

 itnaa hi nahin, siddharmaiya ne apane kaam par bharosa jataate hue janata ke aashirwad se rajya main purna bahumat vaali congress sarkaar banane kaa daawa kiya he
 He has said that a hung assembly will not be good for the development of the state
 haalanki, opinian pole ke mutabik, rajya main sabase badi party ke rup main congress hi ubhar rahi he
 But she appears to be away from the absolute majority
 kise kitni seat (opinian pole)-congress karnataka main sabase badi party ke taur par ubhar kar saamne aa rahi he, lekin bahumat ke aankade se ye phir bhi darjan bhar siton se peeche rah jaaegi
 According to Karvy's estimate, the Congress is going to get 90-101 seats in the 224-seat assembly

 This figure is about 30 seats less than the government formation figure in Karnataka

 There is good news for Delhiites just before New Year's Eve
 darasal shuukravaar subah se dilli ke zyaadaatar ilaakon ke atm ke baahar se lambii lambii kataren nadaarad dikhin
 Aajtak's team visited Daryaganj, Asaf Ali Road and Chandni Chowk areas on Friday
 teenon hi jagahon par teen alag-alag bainkon ke atm par pahunchane par vahaan ikkaa-dukka log hi dikhe
 Everyone was happy that they did not have to queue for hours on New Year's celebrations
 atm main aane vaale logon ko mahaj 5-10 minute main cash mil rahaa tha
 Bank of Baroda KATM in Dariyaganj, along with the shopkeeper who runs a mobile shop, believes that since Thursday evening, there is enough cash in the ATM and people are able to withdraw cash easily
 cash nikaalane aae logon ne bhi mana ki pehle ke mukaable ab unhen raahat mil rahi he
 But at the moment, he was also not able to increase the cash withdrawal limit
 logon ke mutabik nae saal main unhen piem modi se cash nikaalane kii limit badaye jane kii ummid he
 There may be a queue again when the salary arrives, even though the queue is out from outside the ATM just before the new year, but there is a possibility of re-queuing in the first or early days of the new year, because in the end of the month, the people will get the amount of money
 Are rarely, but on getting salary, it is feared that people can once again go to the ATM, which can lead to queues outside the ATM again

 ) The creation of a new constitution should be considered a milestone in Nepal's political development
 april 2008 main pehali samvidhan sabha (sie-1) ko chunane ke baad se hi nepaliyon ko is ghadi kaa intjaar tha
 By that time, the monarchy was over and King Gyanendra's throne was gone
 sie-1 ne apni pehali hi baithak main iskaa bahishkaar karne vaale chaar sadasyon ko chhod den to takreeban aam sahmati se nepal ko sangheey janatantric ganraajya ghoshit kar diya tha
 The responsibility of completing the unfinished business of this assembly was on the shoulders of CA-2 which was elected in November 2013
 nepal ke teen bade rajnatik dalon nepali congress, nekapa (emale) or anekpa (maovadi) ne samaveshi janatantr ke uddeshy ko saakaar karne kii disha main aage badaae kii bajaae un saamaajik or rajnatik mulyon se kinaaraa kar liya jin par unke bich ek sahmati kaayam hui thi
 Today the representation of tribes, Dalits, Madhesi and women is missing
 inaki najar se dekhen to nayaa samvidhan kisi nae ganraajya kii neenv nahin rakh rahaa balki rajshahi se mahaj kulinshahi main sankraman kaa ek pratik he
 This has led to unnecessary civil strife in Nepal which seems to be prolonged
 nepal kaa samoochaa dakshini hissaa jal rahaa he
 Can the rising rebellion in the Terai be ignored? If that was done, it would be a misfortune for Nepal
 agar janajatiyaan bhi apane adhikaron ko lekar bhadakin, to yah tanaav pahaado main fail saktaa he
 The Terai, spread over less than one-fourth of Nepal's landmass, is home to the majority of its population and is also the center of Nepal's economy as it is Nepal's gateway not only to India but also to the rest of the world
 apni anivaary aapurtiyon ke liye nepal, namak se lekar petroleum utpaadon samet takreeban har cheez ke liye bharat par hi nirbhar he
 This journey of Nepal to democracy has gone through very temporary constitutions
 1948 kaa samvidhan ranaashahee ko manyata detaa tha
 The constitution that followed in 1951 introduced the concept of 'a king with a council of ministers'
 sar iver jenings—jo aadhunik vyavasthaaon main janatantr lekin puraatan vyavasthaaon main rajshahi ke samarthak the—ne 1959 main 'shahi tohfe' ke rup main jis samvidhan kaa nirmaan kiya, usamen raja ko samvidhan kaa strot bataaya gaya tha
 King Mahendra did not tolerate this much, so he sacked the elected government the next year and established a monarchy without political parties in 1962
 nabbe ke dashak ke janandolanon kaa parinaam rahi sanvaidhanik rajshahi, jise or saaf karne kaa kaam 1996 main shuru hue maovadi jansangharsh ne kiya or jisaki parinti 2001 main mahal ke narsanhaar main hui
 The current constitution is the seventh in 67 years and is immediately after the 2007 interim constitution
 jenings ne 1959 main officer in vatting damodar shamsher jang bahadur rana se kaha tha, ''aapke jaise alpaviksit desh main anaavashyak logon kii anaavashyak mahatvakankshaon ko kabhi bhi ahmiyat nahin di jaani chahie
 "now the leaders of Nepal must free themselves from this reverse advice
 aaj rajyon kii simaaon ke parisemen kii dobaaraa samiksha kiye jane kii jarurat he
 The decision to combine 12 out of the twenty districts of the Terai and convert them into contiguous hilly districts makes Tharu and Madhesi feel that they have been victims of forgery
 unki do anya ahm maangen ye hai ki vanchit samoohon ko rajya ke angon main samaanupatik pratinidhitiv diya jaae or aabaadi ke aadhaar par kshetron kaa parisemen kiya jaae
 Both these provisions were part of the 2007 interim constitution

 That is why India has always advocated an equitable outcome there and has kept itself away from subtle processes
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne nepal kii apni pehali yatra main jo sandesh diya tha, usamen koi do raay nahin ho sakati
 He advocated a constitution that could be the bearer of ideas emanating from the womb of mass movements

 sattadhari gathbandhan ke sambhavit netritv kii ore se ai yah baat vivekahin he ki dwipaksheeya agenda ke badale main bharat kaa samarthan hasil kiya jaae
 India's relationship with Nepal is people-centric, which does not always determine the relationship between the South Block and the Singh Darbar
 sanvaidhanik visheshgy shambhu singhda ne ek baar kaha tha, ''ek ko agar chot lagati he to dard duusare ko hota he
 "learn more now, before Nepal's economy is further damaged or the indo-nepal relationship is hurt further, the Nepalese leadership must bring together all its people by showing foresight, as they did during the peace process

" ’’ The atmosphere from Parliament to the street was heated with a news item published in 'the Hindu' on Friday about the Rafale deal
 khabar ke mutabik rafel ko lekar piemo alag se saudebaazi kar rahaa tha jis par raksha mantralay ne kadaa aitaraaz jataayaa tha
 Rahul Gandhi directly targeted the PM on this matter, while the Defense Minister kept denouncing this allegation in Parliament and outside
 rafel ko lekar da hindu kii tazaa report ne piemo ko kathghare main khadaa kar diya he
 According to the report, the PMO on Rafael was negotiating with the French side parallel to the Ministry of Defense
 raksha sachiv ne is baat par kadaa aitaraaz jataayaa tha
 The Secretary of Defense called it a dilution of bargaining power
 da hindu ne raksha mantralay kaa yah note bhi chapa he
 The Hindu says that the government hid this thing before the Supreme Court
 en ram ne NDTV se kaha, "pehle ye dhyaan den ki itani ahm jaankaree sarkaar ne supreme court ko nahin di
 When she came to the Supreme Court, she did not put this information in front of him
 raksha mantralay ke logon ne virodh kiya
 From the Indian side, the head of the negotiating team, who is very senior in the Air Force, no less than the Deputy Chief, is very blunt that since you are doing it quietly, we came to know it from the French negotiating team
 unke general ne hamen ek patr likhaa- jo unako bhi refar kiya gaya
 And then they raised it in front of the PMO and they confirmed that they were doing it
 yah bahut sangeen masalaa he, samprabhu guarantee kaa, or sarkari guarantee kaa, bank guarantee kaa, arbitreshan agreement kaa
 It is a matter of money, you make a huge advance payment
 ye saare mudde bahut qaayade se uthaae gaye
 So they do this - back to back conversations, and parallel conversations
 or upar ye saaf nirdesh hai or wo isko nicha dikhaa rahe hai
 So the then Secretary of Defense has left no stone unturned
 ye kehane main ki isse moltol kii takat ghategi
 This story speaks for itself
 "khabar chhapate hi rahul gandhi ne sidhe pradhanmantri par nishaanaa saadhaa
 Referring to the report of The Hindu newspaper, Rahul Gandhi said that the newspaper opened the poll of PM Modi
 khud raksha mantralay ne ye baat kahi he ki saude ko lekar piem kii samanaantar baat chal rahi thi
 The Ministry of Defense had also opposed the interference of the PMO
 sansad main bhi is khabar kii halchal dikhi
 Amid the din in the Lok Sabha, Defense Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said within and outside Parliament that the PMO simply monitored, did not interfere
 nirmala sitaraman ne hindu par adhuri reporting karne kaa aarope bhi lagaaya
 He said that The Hindu did not say that the Defense Minister himself had rejected this objection
 rafel saude ko lekar rajyasabha main bhi hangaamaa hua
 The uproar was so great that the proceedings were adjourned till Monday, shortly after the commencement of the proceedings
 raksha mantri kii vah tippanee enditivi ke paas bhi he
 The Defense Minister then wrote, "the Defense Secretary can meet the Prime Minister's Principal Secretary and resolve the matter
 aisa lagata he piemo or frans ke raashtrapati kaa daphtar maamle kii nigaraanee kar rahe hai
 Para 5 seems to have some additional feedback
 "us samay ke raksha sachiv ji mohan ne bhi da hindu akhbaar kii khabar par pratikriya dete hue kaha he ki raksha mantralay kii aapatti kaa qimaton se koi lenaa-dena nahin tha
 It was about sovereign guarantee and general terms

 saal 2019 main is nae saal ko 17 agast ke din manaaya ja rahaa he
 Parsi New Year is celebrated every year on 17 August
 parsiyon ke liye yah nayaa saal behad hi khaas hota he
 Because unlike other religions, Zoroastrianism does not have many festivals
 parsiyon ke saal main teen mukhya tyohaar hote hai
 The first is Khordad Sal, the second is the birthday of Lord Proufet Jarsthru and the third is March 31 (new Year of the Zoroastrians in Iran)
 Janmashtami 2019: janmashtami kab he? 23 yaa 24 agast, jaaniye yahamparsi dharm main ek saal 360 din kaa hota he baaki kaa 5 din wo log 'gaatha' karte hai
 Gatha means the day to remember your ancestors
 parsi log nayaa saal shuru hone kaa jashn manaane ke 5 din pehle se hi purvajon ke liye puja-paath karte hai
 These people 3 at night
 30 baje khaas puja-archana karte hai
 Just like Shraddha in Hinduism, Parsis worship their ancestors for the peace of soul during these 5 days
 aaj ke din parsi samudaay ke log agni mandar (aagiyari) main jaakar puja-paath karte hai
 At the same time, Parsis living in parts of Iran celebrate the New Year on 31 March

 You will be surprised to know that patients already suffering from neglected mental illnesses in the society often send them back to major hospitals for treatment of common ailments without treatment
 isi se judi otism kii shikaar ek ladki ke pita ne aspataalon ke is ravaiya ko lekar hoicourt main chunauti di he
 In fact, when 28-year-old Akanksha, a victim of autism, fell victim to dengue in November 2015, her father admitted her for treatment in a very large hospital in Delhi, but the hospital refused to treat dengue-prone aspiration, saying He does not have a license for the treatment of mental patients
 aakanksha ke pita sanjay tiwari ke liye yah bada jhatka tha
 He did not think that any hospital could refuse to treat his daughter on grounds of discrimination
 ek taraf beti kii jaan jokhim main thi or duusari taraf aspataal ilaaj se manaa kar rahaa tha
 Sanjay Tiwari did not give up
 aspataal ke is ravaiye ke baad or jagah jaakar bhi ilaaj karaane main sanjay tiwari ko kai mushkilon kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 So Sanjay decided that whatever happened to him in the hospital should not be with the rest and any mental patient
 unhone dilli hai court main ek janhit yachika daal di
 After the filing of this petition, the government received notice from the court and in its affidavit made it clear that no hospital can refuse to treat any patient
 itnaa hi nahin, medical council of india se mili notice ke baad doctor ne aakanksha kaa ilaaj na karne ko lekar maafee bhi maang lee
 Some more things have also been sought in this petition on behalf of Sanjay Tiwari
 isamen har aspataal main maansik rogiyon ko upachaar dene vaale doctor or nurse ko vishesh training dene kii baat bhi shaamil he
 Many times hospitals also avoid treating common illnesses due to mental patients because they do not know what to take care of while giving treatment to the patient
 court jald hi is maamle main apana faisla sunaane vaala he, jisase saaf ho jayega ki agar koi aspataal saadhaaran bimariyon ke ilaaj ke liye maansik rogiyon ko ilaaj dene se manaa karata he to uske khilaaf kya karrwai kii ja sakati he
 Vivek Narayan Sharma, advocate for Sanjay Tiwari, says that there are no specific guidelines given to hospitals in India for treating mental patients for common ailments, and taking advantage of this, hospitals often send such patients back without treatment
 Huh
 farvari main dilli hoicourt is maamle main apana faisla suna saktaa he jo maansik rogiyon or unke parijanon ke liye ek raahat bharaa faisla ho saktaa he

 Some 2,000 years ago, the Roman judge Pilate washed his hands in front of Jewish fundamentalists and declared that he was not responsible for the crucifixion of Jesus Christ
 isamen koi shaq nahin ki vah jisas ke prati adhik eemaandaar tha
 He was angrily kneeling before both the Jews and the perseverance of Jesus Christ
 ek tarah se, antni apane puure kariyar main pilette ke anuyaayi rahe hai or kai chizon se haath dhote rahe hai
 They differ from the irritating Roman judge in the sense that he was only honest
 yaa yon kahen ki saaf-suthere haathon vaale formule par media main saavdhaanee se banaai gai apni chhavi ke prati eemaandaar rahe
 How did they get used to showing clean hands? The answer to this question is very simple
 sabhi netaaon kii tarah antni bhi satta kii fasal katate hai
 In Indian politics, power bears some special responsibility
 aap bhale hi bhrasht na bane lekin satta main bane rahane ke liye jaruri he ki aap dusron ko bhrasht banane kii raah main rukaawat na paidaa karen
 You may or may not know what corrupt people are doing
 lekin yah koun kahata he ki jab tak aap vah kaam nahin karte jo duusare kar rahe hai to uske bare main jaananaa yaa na jaananaa mahapaap he? jaanane yaa na jaanane-donon sthitiyon main mistar clin kii chhavi rambaan nuskhaa he
 If there is any odor, it can always be removed
 saath hi apane haathon ko saaf-suthri chhavi kii shit se poncha ja saktaa he
 Some people may raise this question: Isn't it unethical to allow corruption in your sphere of influence even if you are not involved in it? Especially at a time when you can use your rights to stop corruption? Once again, the difference between Antony and Pilate is that Antony is not washing hands with anything in Jugupsa
 ve congress ke nishthavan sadsy hai or uske laalach tathaa avasarwaad ke baavjood usamen pade hue hai
 They will also help in bringing the big bee like a loyal soldier
 lekin usamen apana haath nahin daalenge
 Yes, they are unique to a Congressman
 lekin yahi vajah he ki unhen raksha mantri banaaya gaya or is pad par itane lambey samay tak rahane vaale ve shaayad pehle vyakti hai
 To the extent of blind devotion, i am proud that Antony is India's Defense Minister
 itane bade or mahatvapurn rajnatik pad par ve
 K
 krishna menon ke baad pehali baar koi malayalam baitha he
 By the way, Menon was Malayali for name only
 antni ne bahut mehnat se apni jagah banaai or maikiyawili jaisi chaturaai se congress kii raajnneeti main maharath hasil kii
 Due to that mastery and the Gandhian image of his friends in the media, he reached where he wanted to reach
 unke yahaan tak pahunchane main rajkaaj karne kii unki kshamta kaa yogadan nahin he
 Now if he returns to Kerala, i will feel very sad because Chief Minister Oman Chandy has worked hard round the clock to control the situation and has proved himself to be a different kind of Congress Chief Minister
 shashan ke maamle main unhen maat dena antni ke liye mushkil hoga
 Indeed, the Malayalis need good governance after five bad years of Achuthanandan
 aisa lagata he ki yahaan dow
 There is a lesson for both Manmohan Singh and Antony
 donon hi vyaktigat rup se eemaandaar maane jate hai
 But if corruption in your region thrives and you don't take any steps to stop it or pretend not to know about it, is it excusable? Paul Zakaria is a Malayali writer and political commentator tabadatod encounter kar aparaadh kii qamar todane main juty UP police ne ekbar phir filmi andaaj main aparaadhiyon ko chetavanee jari kii he
 The style of this ed issued by the Yogi Police of UP on April Fool's Day is also very clever
 upi police ne apane twitor handle se is vigyaapan ko share kiya he, jisamen filmon ke kai sanvaadon kaa istemaal kiya gaya he
 The film uses such film dialogues that make fun of the law

 # aprilfoolsdaypic

 com / vuin636qz5 — UP POLICE (@uppolice) April 1, 2018UP Police made fun of all those dialogues and wrote 'something must be the reason Villain is killed in the end'
 aid main kanoon kaa majaak udaane vaale kuch filmon ke sheershak bhi shaamil kiye gaye hai, jaise 'andhaa kanoon' or 'kanoon meri mutthi main'
 With these film dialogues mocking the law, the UP police has written in its own message, 'happy day to every criminal who has committed such bragging'
 UP police kaa chulbul pandey andaazapako bataa den ki yogi adityanath ke CM banane ke baad aparaadhiyon ke khilaaf oparation olout chalaa rakhi upi police ne 2018 ke aagaman par bhi kuch isi tarah kaa vyangypurna vigyaapan dekar sharaab pikar gaadi chalaane waalon ko aagaah kiya tha
 Then the UP police had written the dialogue of Salman Khan's film for the drunk driving driver, 'will put such a blockade that you will get confused where to enter and run from where'

 In this connection, on Friday, Sonia Gandhi called a meeting of opposition leaders
 meeting main raashtrapati chunaav main ranneeti par gaur kiya gaya
 But many other issues were also discussed
 aapako bataate hai baithak se nikalakar ai 7 badi baaten:chunaav raashtrapati or up-raashtrapati kaa, nishane par 2019is baat main koi shaq nahin he ki raashtrapati or up-raashtrapati chunaav kaa ankaganit sarkaar ke haq main he
 Therefore, the objective of mobilization of opposition camp is not just these elections but also the general elections of 2019
 bihar main mahagathbandhan kii ekta ne bijepi ko haar kaa munh dikhaaya tha
 But Mayawati's separation in UP became a reason for victory for the BJP
 isi se sabak lete hue vipaksh main ye bhaavana jor pakad rahi he ki bijepi ko rokane ke liye virodhiyon ko gile-shikave bhulaakar saath aana hoga
 For this reason, issues like Kashmir and internal security were also discussed in this meeting along with the presidential election
 YSR congress or tiesar ne badhaai mushkilsarkaar ke ankaganit ko jaganmohan reddy kii YSR congress ke samarthan ne or majboot kiya he
 Opposition leaders consider the corruption cases against Jagan as a major reason behind this
 lekin vipakshi partiyon ke ranneetikaron ko ummid he ki 2019 tak ye halaat badal sakate hai
 At the same time, TRS and Congress are face to face in Telangana
 telugana ke congress prabharee digvijay singh ke tikhe hamalon ke baad tiares ne is chunaav main endie ko samarthan kaa elaan kar diya tha, lekin apni secular chhavi ko banane ke liye phir nayaa rukh apnaane ke sanket de die
 Despite this, both these parties stayed away from this meeting
 haalanki, upi se akhilesh-maaya kaa or bengal se mamata-left kaa saath aana virodhiyon ke liye raahat kii baat rahi
 BJD and AIADMK do not open cards Naveen Patnaik in Odisha does not want to open its cards at present

 ovaisi or aap se ummidexduddin ovaisi par andarkhaate bijepi ko phayda pahunchane kaa aarope lagata rahaa he
 On the other hand, the fight between the Aam Aadmi Party and the BJP is at the peak these days
 kejariwal or congress ke bich bhi rishte talakh hai
 It is for this reason that AIMIM and Aam Aadmi Party were not called in Friday's meeting
 lekin sabko ummid he ki bijepi virodh kii siyasat main ye saath honge
 Waiting for the government's strategy In the meeting, it was agreed that the opposition should first wait for the announcement of candidates for the presidential and vice-presidential elections
 iske baad ummidavaar kii kamiyaan ginaakar apana pratyaashee khadaa kiya jaae
 Congress has left candidature for the presidential election so far, the names of Gopal Krishna Gandhi, Sharad Pawar, Sharad Yadav and Meera Kumar have been suggested by the Congress
 ek prastaav pranab mukherjee ko duusari pari saunpane kaa bhi he
 However, Pawar has distanced himself
 raashtrapati pranab mukherjee bhi sarkaar ke samarthan ke bagaiyr dobaaraa ummidavaari ke paksh main nahin hai
 Looking at the political image of Sharad Yadav, he may have reservations about his name
 aisi surat main congress ne saaf kiya he ki wo ummidavaari se peeche hatane ke liye taiyaar he
 Which side will sit Nitish? Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar did not attend this meeting
 lekin khabar ai ki wo shanivaar ko piem se milane vaale hai
 Due to this, his intention is bound to be questioned

 kolkata main ravivaar raat se chal rahi siyaasi halchal mangalvaar tak khatm ho gai, lekin iske myne dur tak nikaale ja rahe hai
 This is the first time that a Chief Minister is sitting on a dharna to save any of his officers from CBI
 pashchim bengal main yah sab itnaa teji se hua ki anumaan kii gunjaaish hi nahin bachi
 Now both are calling the Supreme Court's decision their own victory
 court ne kaha he ki sharada chitfund maamle main kolkata ke police kamishnar rajeev kumaar se sibiai shilong main poochtacha kar sakati he
 But he cannot be arrested
 udhar, rajeev kumaar ko bhi court ne aadesh he ki vah sibiai ke saamne pesh hon
 Mamta Banerjee has ended the sit-in, calling it her victory, but the question arises whether TMC and BJP got it? The BJP had nothing to lose in West Bengal at the moment
 bijepi jis tarah mamata par dabaav banaae hue thi, use dekhte hue mamata ko ek maukey kii talash thi or unhen vah ravivaar ko mil gaya
 On the other hand, the BJP has got such arguments that Mamata is promoting corruption and why she is coming forward to save an officer? Mamatapure became the face of the opposition if the political developments are seen immediately
 Has suddenly made Mamata Banerjee the face of opposition
 unhone jatke main ek aisa kadam uthaaya jiskaa samarthan karne ke liye tamaam dal ikattha ho gaye yaa unhen naitik samarthan dena padaa
 From SP chief to Congress president Rahul Gandhi, RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav, all the opposition leaders announced to support Mamata and some leaders even reached Kolkata
 supreme court kaa nirnay aane ke baad chandrababu naidu ne hi unka dharna khatm karaayaa
 From there it was announced that now the next battle will be fought in Delhi
 swaabhaavik he ki iske centre main mamata banerjee hi hongi
 With the formation of SP-BSP alliance, Mayawati's graph suddenly increased
 chandrababu naidu kaa graph bhi chadha tha jab vah sabhi vipakshi dalon ko ekajute kar rahe the
 In Mamta's rally, Kejriwal was robbed of the Mahafil
 lekin aaj kii taarikh main halaat badal gaye hai or mamata ek baar phir vipaksh kii ore se res main aage hai
 Mamata was in trouble due to the way the BJP was pressurizing the Trinamool Congress in Bengal
 amit shah kaa helicopter utarane kii unhone parmishan nahin di
 To stop the bjp's rath yatra, she did not even fear the court and put her side firmly
 isse ek sandesh jane laga tha ki mamata bijepi se dar gai hai
 The wrong message was also going on among the workers
 lekin ek jatke main unhone pasa palat diya
 TMC workers took to the streets after the CBI action, they stopped trains
 narebaaji kii or ek tarah se puraa cader sadakon par aa gaya
 It is the biggest thing for a leader that at one of his behest, his workers come out on the streets and be ready to do anything at the behest of the leader
 mamata centre sarkaar or bijepi ko nishane par leti raheen hai, lekin sattadhari party ke kaaryakartaaon ko sadakon par utaar dena badi uplabdhi maani jaati he
 Mamta can compete with BJP, she has been able to give the message that she can say bjp's fight
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne unka samarthan kiya lekin unheen ke saansad or pashchim bengal congress ke purv adhyaksh adheer ranjan choudhary ne mamata kii aalochana kii
 He said that Mamta is promoting corruption
 sipiem kii haalat aisi ho gai thi ki vah kuch kehane kii sthit main hi nahin rahi
 She could not support Mamta nor support the CBI
 aise main jab puraa desh ek ghatana ko kautuhal kii najar se dekh rahaa tha ek party kaa koi pratikriya na vyakt karnaa uski duvidha ko dikhaata he
 Mamta has told in her step that she is the only one who can compete with BJP
 unhone hi sipiem kaa muqabla kiya tha
 That is why he chose the metro channel to picket the same place where he had done a long sit-in against the CPM and considered the Tatas to leave from Singur
 iske alaava vampanth ke durg ko bhi dharaashahee kar satta par kabiz huin
 What BJP got: Actually, BJP had nothing to lose in Bengal
 bijepi ko 2014 main pashchim bengal main 2 siten mili hai
 Now, even though it has set a target of 22 seats, the party believes that it was able to expose Mamata
 sabase badi baat mamata ne apane bhaashanon or pratikriya se tay kar diya ki ab pashchim bengal main trinmul kaa muqabla bijepi se hoga
 This became a big thing for a party that has two mps and is dreaming of forming its own government
 rajeev kumaar se poochtacha ko bijepi ne apni jeet bataaya ravishankar prasad ne press conference karke kaha ki aakhir rajeev kumaar kya raaj jaanate hai ki mamata unhen bachaana chaahati hai
 Smriti Irani also questioned him
 mamata ko gherne main kaamyaab rahebijapi apane kaaryakartaaon ko yah sandesh dene main safal rahi ki mamata bijepi kaa virodh karne ke liye kisi bhi had tak ja sakati hai
 Therefore there is a need to be stronger
 pehle unhone amit shah kaa helicopter nahin utarane diya
 Then Yogi's chopper did not allow the landing, but when UP CM Yogi Adityanath reached the rally in Purulia by road, the West Bengal government had to give permission
 ab bijepi netaaon ke daure kaa silsilaa shuru hone vaala he, shivaraj buudhvaar ko khadgpur main raily karne ja rahe hai
 Amit Shah and Modi have held several rallies
 aane vaale dinon main yah jubaani jang or tej hogi or pashchim bengal kii dharti ek baar phir tikhi raajnneeti kaa gavaah banegi
