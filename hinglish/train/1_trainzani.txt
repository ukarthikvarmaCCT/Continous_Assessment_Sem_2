 In the Security Council meeting, China has once again saved terrorist Masood Azhar
 use vaishvik aatanki ghoshit karne ke prastaav par vito laga diya he
 China has done this thrice before
 bharat, america samet kai desh china ke vito se naaraaz hai
 At the same time, Masood Azhar, the leader of terrorist organization jaish-e-mohammed, is now making rhetoric
 masood pakistan main hi he or biimaar nahin bilkul feet he
 If anyone had any doubt, Masood Azhar himself announced it
 jis vakt puri duniya masood par suraksha parishad main hone vaale faisle kaa intjaar kar rahi thi us vakt wo bhi bahawalpur main apane headquarter main baithkar duniya kii bechaini par hans rahaa tha
 He declared his carefree yesterday morning through the newspaper of his terrorist organization jaish-e-mohammed
 pakistani mantri kaa bayaan niklaa jhoothamasud ne apane kollam main likhaa he ki wo bilkul swasth he
 Masood has also said that he has not had any disease
 masood ajahar har hafte jaish ke akhbaar main kollam likhata he
 This newspaper is published in Peshawar, Pakistan
 ab yaad kiijie pakistan ke videsh mantri shah mahmud kuraishi kaa wo bayaan, jo unhone haal hi main america news channel ke intervyuu main diya tha
 Qureshi had described Masood as very ill
 pakistani sena or sarkaar kii munh par tamaachajab imran sarkaar ko laga ki masood ke uski sarazmi par hone ke kaboolname se kahin baat na bighad jaae to sena ke jariye ye kahalwaya ki jaish mohammad kaa pakistan main astitv hi nahin he, lekin pakistani sena or pakistan kii sarkaar donon ke munh par tamaacha jadte hue masood ne khud kah diya ki wo pakistan main hi he or bilkul feet he
 This proves what is the status of terrorists in Pakistan
 aatanki kii dhaal bana china, puri duniya naarajajis tarah se hafiz said ke global aatanki ghoshit hone ke baavjood pakistan main use har tarah kii chhot mili he
 From this, questions have also arisen that even if the tag of Global Terrorist is tagged on Masood
 haalanki maujuuda daur ko dekhen to pakistan par masood ko lekar dabaav bahut zyada he or iskaa sidhaa asar china par bhi padane vaala he
 That is why China stands as a shield of Masood, taking the displeasure of the whole world

 bhartiya purush kya apni dulhan kii virginity (comarya) ko lekar ab bhi utane hi samvedansheel hai jitne dashak bhar pehle tak hua karte the? yaa ise is tarah kahen ki agar actress khushboo apane 2005 ke bayaan ko doharaaen, ‘‘koi bhi padhaa-likhaa mard yah nahin chahega ki uski patni ko virgin hona hi chahie’’ to kya phir un par juute or andey phenke jaaenge, unhen adaalat main ghasita jayega, or tivi par saarvajanik maafee maangane ke liye majaboor hona padegaa?india today group-emdiare sex survey, 2013 se to yahi sanket miltaa he ki aaj bhi purushon kaa rujhaan vaisaa hi he
 The survey shows that the proportion of men having premarital sex is three times that of women, yet at least 77 percent of men still insist on "virgin grooming"
 yah haroonges he kyonki stri-purush ke mail-jol ke tareekon main baari badlaav spasht dikhaai de rahaa he
 Twenty years ago, most people did not openly accept their "boyfriends" and "girlfriends"
 lekin, ab dating ko lekar soch badali he or is par logon kaa rukh narm hua he
 By the 1980s, if a film star had a romance with someone, it was only through the gossip of Stardust
 aaj, sitare khulkar yah baaten karte hai ki ve kise date kar rahe hai, kiske saath unka brallep hua he, yaa kiske saath liv-in relationships main rah rahe hai
 In the sex survey, the difference between the percentage of women and men who accept pre-marital sex is also confusing
 agar vivaah purv sex ke maamle main striyon ke mukaable purushon kii sankhya teen guna adhik he to inamen adhiktar purush yaa to veshyalayon main jate honge yaa ek se adhik partner vaali mahilaon kii sankhya zyada hogi
 It is more likely that due to social taboo women are hesitant to accept sex before marriage
 pichley ek dashak main desh main himanoplasty kii maang main ijapha hua he
 Sometimes it is called "regaining virginity" in light words
 yah comarya jhilli (himan) ko durust karne kii surgery he
 Cosmetic surgeon Anoop Dheer at Apollo Hospital in Delhi says that the demand for hymenoplasty is increasing by 20-30% every year
 chunki isamen kareeb 1 lakh ru
 This is why it can be a pastime of middle and upper middle class
 faridabad main asian institute of medical sciensej main abstetrics kii pramukh anita kaant bataati hai, ‘‘kai ladakiyon kaa maananaa he ki unke partner kitne hi aadhunik kyon na hon, is maamle main purush maansikta roodhiwaadee hi he
 "in other words, in spite of showing some degree of leniency regarding sex in Indian society, there does not seem to be a significant change in the old attitudes related to women
 lekin yah to tay he ki himan ke durust karne se ‘‘khoi’’ virginity waapas nahin pai ja sakati?kya padhe-likhe purushon ko is surgery kii jaankaree nahin hogi? agar baad main unhen iskaa pataa chalata he to kya hoga? aise main, agar jode is bare main khulkar baat kar len to kya paisa, samay or duschintaa se bachaa nahin ja saktaa? survey ke mutabik, 77 fisadi purush kehete hai ki agar koi ladki apane vivaah purv sex sambandhon ke bare main bataati he to ve usase shaadi karenge hi nahin
 However, the fact is that whether Hymen is repaired or not, there can be no indication as to whether a woman has had physical relations
 aksar himan cycling jaise zyada jatke or parishram vaale khel main hissaa lene ke ‘‘fat’’ jaataa he
 And contrary to popular belief, there is no event like "taking off the nose"
 online sex shiksha vaali website scarltin ne himan ko ‘‘yoni ke bahari aavaran’’ kaa naam diya he, uske mutabik himan behad maheen jhilli hoti he jo yoni ko aanshik rup se dhakati he (puri tarah band nahin karti), isliye purush sansarg ke dauraan yah vastav main ‘‘tuutati, fatati, bikharati’’ nahin he
 On the contrary, it bursts a little bit and later also gets repaired automatically
 kai ladakiyon main himan kaaphi lacheelee hoti he or sansarg ke dauraan ek ore ko sarak jaati he
 This is the reason why many women who are active in the matter of sex do not matter and they retain their place
 in tathyon ke baavjood lagbhag sabhi samaajon or samskritiyon main purush ‘‘virgin’’ mahilaon ke prati kaaphi samvedansheel bane hue hai
 And they are ready to pay any price for this
 2012 main 22 varshiya college chaatra natali dialan ne net par apni virginity kii nilaamee kii thi
 He needed money for his tuition
 nilaamee kii boli 37 lakh dollar tak pahunchi
 How can this male mentality be understood about the virginity of women? Some argue that it is the traditional way for a man to be convinced that his bride has not become the mother of another child before
 lekin aaj ke jamaane main yah kya he?lekhak or gender studies ke professor hugo ‘‘vizr virginity ke bare main purush maansikta ko ‘‘mardaana takat ko lekar chintaa’’ or ‘‘pratispardhaa ke dar’’ se jodate hai
 This means that men have insecurity about sex
 agar vah vahaan tak pahunch saktaa he, jahaan tak pehle koi purush nahin pahunchaa he to use isaki chintaa nahin hogi ki uski mardaana takat kii tulana dusron se kis tarah kii jaaegi!yah asuraksha bodh hi saamaajik manyataon ke aavaran main chipa rahata he
 The Kama Sutra advises fathers that if their sons marry virgin girls, they will gain "social prestige"
 yah bhi dilachasp he ki aitihaasik rup se virgin dulhan kii kaamana madhya or ucch madhya varg main hi rahi he, or aisa sirf bharat main hi nahin he
 Princess Diana, who had been busy securing her privacy for most of her life, had to undergo the much-talked-about virginity test during her marriage, and her uncle was proud to announce her results publicly
 victoria yug main angrej ucch varg ke jode karage ride, sparsh yaa chumban se zyada kuch karne kaa saahas nahin dikhaa sakate the, jabaki 1800 main england main kaamgaar varg kii kareeb ek-tihaai striyaan shaadi ke din hi garbhvatee pai jaati thim!isi saal madhya pradesh main rajya sarkaar ke garib or adivasee pariwaron kii madad ke liye yojit samuhik vivaah main 450 dulahanon ko virginity or pregnancy test se guzarana padaa
 Officials were surprised to learn that some of the bridegrooms were pregnant
 unhen aayojan se nikaal diya gaya
 The oldest cultural reference in India about female virginity is found in the book Arthashastra about 2000 years ago
 isamen arthvyavastha or prashasan sambandhi nitiyaan hai
 It has different economic penalties for different castes and classes in cases of girls' virginity being violated
 oonchi jati ke purushon ke liye, apni jati kii kisi ladki kaa comarya bhang karne par 400 pan jurmaana yaa haath kaatane kaa dand tha jabaki kisi daasi putree ke maamle main yah 12 pan or kapade tathaa gahane dene kaa praavdhaan tha
 Virginity is not only weighed by economic value, but also legislation that assesses upper-class virginity as "expensive commodity" and so-called lower-caste virginity as "cheap commodity"
 lekin donon hi maamalon main he yah ‘‘vastu’’ hi
 In this way women are made objects of different brands and value
 yahi vah siddhant he jiske tahat purush virgin dulahanon kii kharid karata he
 It is no different that women would have plastic or metal sex and child-bearing machines and were bought from shops
 yah vahi kutsit soch he ki ekadam nai mashin kharidi jaae, jiskaa sil band ho
 Who would want to buy second hand goods? And if you want to buy second hand goods, then you will want to buy cheaply
 bharat ke kai hisson main jahaan stri-purush anupaat itnaa ghat gaya he ki shaadi karne ke liye ladkiyaan nahin milteen, vahaan ‘‘dulhan taskari’’ kaa rivaaj chal padaa he
 a family with many brothers buys "dulhan" which is useful for the sex of all the brothers and to produce a child
 or jab unhen lagata he ki uskaa khub istemaal ho gaya he to use kisi or jaruratmand parivaar ko kuch saste main bech diya jaataa he
 In this way, a "bride" can be bought and sold up to five times
 iske alaava kuch aise samudaay hai jo parampara se apni betiyon kii veshyavriti par hi nirbhar hai
 He is celebrated here as a celebration of the breach of virginity of a girl or "nath Utrai"
 is aayojan main use sabase oonchi boli lagane vaale ko bechaa jaataa he
 And if someone buys something, who is going to say how to use it or not? No wonder 80% of men in India today-mdra survey believe that if they have married a woman He also has the right to have sex with her
 yaa 80 pratishat yah kehete hai ki agar ve napunsak ho jate hai to bhi unki patniyon ko doosraa sex partner talashne kaa koi haq nahin he
 But ultimately, the inhuman attitude of men to consider a woman as an object of sexual intercourse and childbearing is not maintained only on their own
 paramparaagat striyaan bhi khud ko usee rup main dekhnaa chaahati hai
 Women die of anxiety about being fit in the virginity or sexual aspirations of men, are victims of opportunism, anxiety
 bharat main striyon kii virginity kaa mulya sthapit hue 2000 saal ho gaye hai
 Now the time has come to challenge it, change it
 or yah tabhi hoga jab bhartiya stri apane sharir, apni kaam bhaawanaaon kii maalik khud bananaa seekhegi
 When they learn to say patriarchy, eye to eye, that i have a body, i have to take a decision about it myself, get lost and never look here

 The elections in five states, including Uttar Pradesh, will have its first impact on 58 seats in the Rajya Sabha to be held in april-may 2012 and the presidential elections in june-july

 ve satta se baahar hone ke baad pradesh ko chaar hisson main baantkar apni siyaasi takat badhaane ke mansoobey ko bhi paravaan nahin chadha paaengi
 Mayawati is trying to show the election as BSP vs Congress as part of her special strategy

 'indian express' main chhapi khabar ke mutabik anna hajaare yaa phir unhen salaah dene vaale log shaayad shanti bhushan ko cameti main shaamil nahin karte
 However, in a conversation with NDTV India, Justice Hegde said that the stay of Shanti Bhushan would not affect the functioning of the drafting committee, it is a different matter that on moral grounds it can be said that he should have been kept out of the committee from the beginning

 This double happiness was shared by the younger Nawab of RJD chief with the workers in his style
 bihar ke siyaasi samar main mahagathbandhan kii jeet ke sabase bade suurama banakar ubhare lalu prasad kii party ko rajya vidhansabha main 80 siten hasil hue hai
 There was a long queue of activists and their fans outside when they woke up on Sunday on their birthday on Sunday after the election results on Sunday
 sabhi ne unhen janmdin kii badhai di
 Gave sweets and garlands of flowers
 padhein, tejasvi bole- narendra modi kaa future kya he'vikaas he hamaari prathimakata'tejasvi kehete hai, 'yah dohari khushi kaa mauka he

 'look at the photos, who did what on the election results? With Rambi's reincarnation in the top Parbishar politics from Nambari, both sons of Hailalu Prasad and Tejaswi have won from Raghopur and Mahua assembly seats
 243 sadasyeey bihar vidhansabha main pichhali baar lalu kii party ko mahaj 22 siten mili thim or wo aankadon ke lihaaj se teen number kii party ke netaa banakar rah gaye the
 Since the introduction of demonetisation in the country, the black game of blacking out black money continues unabated throughout the country and Bihar is also not untouched by it
 lekin bihar main kalaadhan ko safed karne kaa kaala khel khilne main bihar sarkaar ke mulajim bhi kisi se peeche nahin he
 The poor people of Bihar are getting fed up in playing this game by the government employees
 sarkari mulajimon dwaara kalaadhan ko safed karne kaa kaala khel khilne kaa taaja maamla he bihar ke aurangabad jile kaa
 Panchayat servants of Dadar Panchayat of Goh block of the district distributed old notes of five hundred, disregarding all the rules and laws among the poor beneficiaries in the name of widow and old age pension
 panchayaat sevakon dwaara labhaanviton ke bich paanch sau ke puraane note baante jane ke maamle kaa bhandaphod hone ke baad se graminon kaa gussa saatven aasmaan par pahunch gaya or sabhi panchayat sevakon ke khilaaf pradarshan karne lage
 In fact, there is a provision for payment of widow and old pension to the beneficiaries by not sending cash to their account
 lekin panchayaat sevakon dwaara paanch sau ke puraane note ko khapat karne ke galat niyat se sabhi labhaanviton ko panchayat main bulaayaa gaya or sabon ke bich puraane note ko baant diya gaya
 Some of the beneficiaries have busted why this rupee was paid in the form of pension even after the old 500-rupee note had ceased to operate, then what started the uproar
 prakhand vikaas padaadhikari ke hastkshep or labhaanviton se puraane note waapas lene ke baad maamla shant hua
 Block Development Officer Sunil Kumar said that in view of the seriousness of the case, orders have been ordered to investigate the entire matter and strict action will be taken against the officers found guilty in the investigation
 karnataka main congress-jedies sarkaar baikfoot par thimedhya pradesh main aisa nahin he kyonki BJP ke do MLA congress ke saath hambijapi vidhayakon ke samarthan se aaraam se chalegi kamalnath sarkarabijepi ke agle kadam or karrwai par tikin sabaki nigahenkarnataka main congress-jedies sarkaar ko gire abhi 24 ghante bhi nahin hue or idhar madhya pradesh main mukhyamantri kamalnath ne elaan kar diya ki bijepi ke do vidhayak congress ke saath hai
 Both these BJP mlas named Narayan Tripathi and Sharad Kaul have confirmed their joining the Congress
 madhya pradesh ke is bade ghatnakram par log yah kehete sune ja rahe hai ki congress ne mahaj 24 ghante main karnataka kaa badla le liya he
 The BJP, which was earlier powering to topple the Kamal Nath government, is now tapping into the anti-mla camp
 karnataka main mangalvaar shaam badi uthapatak hui or 14 maheene puraani congress-jedies gathbandhan sarkaar gir gai
 HD Kumaraswamy's government was reduced to a minority with the resignation of rebel mlas from the Congress and the floor test collapsed
 congress kaa aarope he ki karnataka main bijepi ne uske vidhayakon ko motaa pralobhan diya or unase istife dilwaaye
 In the 225-member Karnataka Assembly, 20 mlas did not appear for the confidence vote
 vishwaas mat ke paksh main 99 jabaki iske khilaaf 105 vot pade
 With this, the BJP announced that it would stake claim to form the government in Karnataka
 kuch aisi hi sthiti madhya pradesh main bhi banati dikh rahi thi
 As the Leader of Opposition in the Madhya Pradesh Assembly Gopal Bhargava said, the government will not run for even a day if orders for numbers one and two are made from above
 bhargav ke is daawey ke baad kayaas lagaae jane lage ki kya madhya pradesh bhi karnataka kii raah par chal padaa he? magar aisa nahin hua or mukhyamantri kamalnath ne kah diya ki 'bijepi hamaari sarkaar ko alpamat main bataa rahi thi or kabhi bhi giraane kii baat kii ja rahi thi lekin aaj voting ke dauraan bijepi ke do vidhayakon ne hamaari sarkaar ko samarthan diya he
 In Karnataka, not unlike Karnataka, Kumaraswamy's government in Karnataka came on the backfoot as many of its mlas rebelled and submitted their resignations to the Speaker
 vishwaas mat ke dauraan 225 sadasyeey karnataka vidhansabha main voting ke liye 20 vidhayak sadan main hajir nahin hue
 99 in favor of the trust vote while 105 votes were cast against it and the government fell
 bijepi ke baagi vidhayakon ke saath kamalnathyaha dhyaan dene vaali baat ye he ki karnataka vidhansabha se congress ke 14 vidhayakon ne istipha diya tha, isliye sarkaar vahaan kaaphi pehle hi alpamat main aa gai thi lekin madhya pradesh main aisi sthiti nahin he
 The Congress has 114 mlas and BJP 108 mlas in the state assembly of 230 mlas
 ab dekhne vaali baat hogi ki bijepi ke donon vidhayak kya party chhodte hai? agar aisa hota he to congress kii sankhya 116 jabaki bijepi 106 par tik jaaegi
 This will be a majority figure for the Congress, while the BJP will be on the backfoot here
 aisi surat main kamalnath sarkaar kii nirdaleey, bispi or sapa vidhayakon par nirbharta kam hogi
 Though the sword of disqualification will be hanging on these two mlas under the change of party law, but it will depend on the Speaker
 aapako bataa den ki bijepi ke kai netaa kamalnath sarkaar giraane main zyada samay na lagane kaa daawa kar chuke hai
 Amidst these statements, Kamal Nath said every time that there is no threat to the Congress government in the state and it will run its full five-year rule
 unhone apni baat ko or majbootee dete hue buudhvaar ko elaan kar diya ki bijepi ke do vidhayak unke kheme main aa gaye hai
 It can be said that amid speculation of political instability, Kamal Nath has indicated that his party will not allow the situation like Karnataka to arise and he also has the power to do so within 24 hours
 france ke raashtrapati chunaav kii daud main aage chal raheen dhur dakshinpanthi ummidavaar marine le pen kaa kahana he ki vah saat may ko hone vaale antim daur ke chunaav se pehle badi sankhya main logon kaa samarthan hasil karne ke liye party ke pramukh pad se istipha de dengi
 Penn took over the National Front (NF) party in 2011 after his father Jean Marie Le Pen
 to vahiin maujuuda raashtrapati francwa oland ne logon se apil kii he ki ve maikron ko vot dekar aglaa raashtrapati chune naa ki marine le pen ko
 Penn told 'france 2' television on Monday that "I have always thought that the President of France is the President of all the people of France and that he has the responsibility to connect the whole country but there is also a need to convert the word into a tax
" is
 pen ne kaha, "maine neshnal front kii adhyakshata chhodane kaa faisla kiya he
 i will no longer be the president of the party
 "sinhua ne pen ke hawaale se bataaya, "ham ve log hai joloaktantr ko paribhaashitakarte hai
 None of my activities will be against the people

 "penn 76 in the election count on Sunday
 7 lakh voton yani 21
 Ranked second with 30 percent votes
 yadi pen (48) chunaav jeet jaati hai to vah desh kii pehali mahila raashtrapati hongi
 These are 11 candidates in the fray for the country's presidential election
 inamen se chaar ummidavaaron ko is daud main sabase prabal mana ja rahaa he, ye hai conservative ummidavaar francwa fillan, dhur dakshinpanthi marine le pen, udaar madhyamargi emmanuele macrone or dhur vampanthi jyaan-luk melncon
 On May 7, there will be a second round of competition between the two candidates who come top in this election
 sabhi ummidavaaron neimigration, arthvyavastha or francisipahchan samet kai muddon ko pramukh chunavi mudda banaaya he
 National security has been a major issue during the election campaign
 maujuuda raashtrapati francwa oland duusare kaarykaal ke liye chunaav nahin lard rahe hai
 He is the first leader in France's modern history to do so, who is not in the election for a second term
 pradhanmantri narendra modi kya 15 agast ko laal kile kii pracheer se railway, retail or banking jaise bade aarthik sudhaaron kii ghoshnaa karne kii himmat juta sakate hai? kya modi elaan karenge ki sansad ke sheet satr main ek vidheyak aayega jo ucch padon par hiton kaa takaraav rokane kaa kanoonee intjaam karata ho? kya yah ghoshnaa ho sakati he ki sarkaar kanoon banaakar sabhi khel sanghon main siyaasi maujuudagi khatm karegi? kya pradhanmantri is elaan kaa saahas dikhaa sakate hai ki rajnatik dalon ke chande kii prakriya ko paardarshee banane ke liye chah maah main kanoon ban jayega?pradhanmantri ne desh se yah poocha he na ki log swadhinata diwas par unase sunanaa kya chaahate hai, to yah rahi apekshaaon suchi
 Of course, the country would no longer want to hear moral education from them
 nai skiimon kii ghoshnaaen to haragij nahin
 When a party has a grand mandate, the opposition is badly broken, the party or its friends have a government in 11 states of the country with the Center, that party's government, in fact, is implementing the policies of the previous government and If the party that has run the previous government has lost its political principal, then the reason for not running the Parliament is not the furious opposition
 modi sarkaar ko yah sawaal ab khud se poochna hoga ki pichley 15 agast se is 15 agast ke bich usne aisa kya-kya kar diya he jisase hataash vipaksh ko aisi ekajutata or urja mil gai he
 The NDA government's entanglement lies behind the haze of parliamentary deadlock in the monsoon session
 sarkaar ek saal ke bheetar hi vishwasaneeyata kii dohari chunauti se mukaabil he, jo upie kii duusari pari se zyada badi he
 The first challenge is that the Modi government is looking weak on the three unwritten values of Indian democracy, which make even a majority-majority government irrelevant
 pehla niyam yah he ki kisi bhi sthiti main sarkaar ko abhivyakti kii aazaadee ko rokte hue najar nahin aana chahie
 The second principle is that the majority, or minority, should have the ability to carry the opposition together, and the third rule, which has recently been attached, is that any agreement on transparency in the higher positions can outweigh the credibility
 is saal main march main abhivyakti kii aazaadee par ankush kii daleel (soochna takanic kanoon kii dhara 66 e) khaarij hone ke baad sarkaar ko chet janaa chahie tha
 But in the Supreme Court (aadhaar case) the fresh plea of not treating privacy as a fundamental right, restrictions on the website and their withdrawal, ban on right to information and whips on voluntary organizations are constantly indicating that it is taking some fundamental liberties Is not comfortable
 sansadeey loktantr main vipaksh ko saath lekar chalanaa 'sarkaar' hone ke liye anivaary he
 Opposition of 15 members was negligible against the majority of Rajiv Gandhi's 413 members but the result of denying it is recorded in history
 bijepi ko congress se mili sabak kii roshni main hi ucch padon par paardarshita ko lekar krantikari hadon tak sakht hona chahie tha
 However, in the Lok Sabha, when External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj was making a passionate appeal for the help of absconding Lalit Modi to help his ailing wife, the past of the business relationship of Swaraj and Modi family was looking back
 sabase badi asangati yah he ki bhartiya loktantr ke in teen mulyon ko bijepi se behatar koi nahin samajhataa, jiskaa puraa rajnatik jivan congress ke saath inhen ko lekar ladate or utpeeda jhelte beetaa he
 But within a year, the BJP made that Congress the biggest advocate of freedom of expression, the importance of the opposition and transparency, which has always been uneasy about its weak past on these values
 duusari chunauti bhi halaki nahin he
 Modi must not forget that he came to power, outlining the model of open market advocacy, privatization, reform and promoting private entrepreneurship, but the governance that has emerged under his leadership in the last one year includes railway reforms, banking reforms, Courageous decisions like subsidy restructuring, administrative reforms are not seen
 sarkaar to nae saarvajanik steel plant (rajyon ke saath) laga rahi he, congress kii tarah saarvajanik upakramon kii aakshamata ko dhank rahi he, sarkari skiimon kii qatari khadi kar rahi he, nae mishan or naukarshahi garh rahi he or sabsidi baantne ke nae tareeke ijad kar rahi he
 There is no objection to social schemes, but new missions and schemes have been imposed on the old system without showing the courage to improve governance
 isliye har mishan sankethik safaltaaon se bhi khaali he
 The Modi government was expected to create a new paradigm of democratic values and liberalization that would not only diverge from the Congress's policy of governance but also counter the bjp's blunders as the opposition
 lekin modi sarkaar pataa nahin kyon yah sabit karnaa chaahati he ki badi safaltaaen apana virdohi charam (anti clymex) saath lekar aati hai?yah katai jaruri nahin he ki sankraman kaa kshan aane main varshon kaa samay lage, kabhi-kabhi ek sankraman ke tatkaal baad doosraa aa saktaa he
 Those who consider the 2014 mandate in favor of Narendra Modi to be the biggest transition in the latest history of India, may now want to revise themselves, because the real transition has come now when Modi has passed a year in power and the boom of expectations is bored
 , Has started sitting with the moisture of annoyance and disillusionment
 modi jab agle saptaah laal kile kii pracheer se desh se mukhaatib honge to desh unase 'man kii baat' nahin balki gavarnence kii do took sunanaa chahega, kyonki desh ke log is baat ko ek baar phir pukhta karnaa chaahate hai ki unhone kamjor kandhon par apni ummiido kaa boj nahin rakhaa he
 Drinking at least five cups of coffee daily reduces the risk of breast cancer in women

 - gulzaar sahabadmi ne aag khoji
 It became easier to calm the inner fire
 phir chakkaa banaaya or kheti shuru kar di
 Created a hut between them to take care of the fields
 kune khod liye
 And settlements settled
 to phir bavaal kab shuru hua
 The day a man raised a pedestal and made a circle on the ground
 or phir kaha
 This piece of land is mine
 tukade ghatate badhate gaye
 Fasts continued to grow
 kabeeley bane, sultanate baniin, mulk bane
 And humans were spoiled to become this
 to gaur se phir ek baar dekhie
 There are fields, there is a hut in the middle of the field
 nahin nahin ye to faujee outpost he
 There is a streak at some furlong distance from it
 jo najar nahin aati
 On the other side of the line is said to be Pakistan
 is taraf hindustan he
 It becomes necessary to tell because if not told, the difference is not understood
 vahaan bhi upree hisse ke log punjabi bolte hai, yahaan bhi
 There are also crazy for cricket, here too
 vahaan bhi karpshan he or yahaan bhi
 People there are told that the root of all the trouble is of the Indians and we are also taught to hate Pakistan
 magar is shor ke bich ek puraane bargad ke neeche kuch darvesh baithe rahete hai
 Place crows on your shoulders
 unhen yahaan vahaan jane ke liye vija nahin chahie hota
 These Darvesh narrate stories
 saajhepan ke
 One such anecdote is now shown on the screen
 naam he kya dilli, kya lahore
 This anecdote starts with that hustle-like outpost and ends there
 magar sachche kisse khatm kahaan hote hai
 They sink into us like seeds
 phir aanch nami paa jab tab badhane lagate hai
 The time is 1948
 bharat-paak seemaa par ek faujee chaowkee he
 Pakistanis have attacked it
 donon taraf ke zyaadaatar log khet rahe
 One soldier left from Pakistan rahamat ali (vijayraj)
 His captain taunts, if you are alive then move on
 ssala muhajir (ve log jo bharat se jaakar pakistan main based) kahin kaa, dikhaa pakistan ke liye apni vafadari
 Rahmat moves forward
 use janaa he or dushmano ke adde se ek file lekar aana he
 This file contains details of a tunnel
 surang jo hindustani khod rahe hai, dilli se lahore ke bich
 On the other hand, there is a soldier trembling at the Indian post
 nahin nahin bas vardi hi khaaki he
 He is a cook
 naam he samarth (manu rishi chaddha)
 The encounter between Rahmat and Samarth begins
 baat hoti he, laat bhi chalati he
 Sometimes paranthas are made, sometimes water is filled
 kabhi goli chalati he to kabhi gaali de kosa jaataa he
 And in the midst of this guilt, the suffering of two countries comes on the pretext of both
 kaise siyasat ke pher main insaan baant die gaye
 Rahmat who was from Delhi and is now searching his street in Lahore
 samarth, jo lahore ke shahon kaa ladkaa tha or ab dilli main pair jamaa rahaa he
 What was the mention of the cities of both
 unhen ek sajhi jameen mil gai
 The gun fell to the side and the tongue moved forward
 ek ji janaab par aa gaya to doosraa bhai jaan par
 But where does honey appear on every tree? so kahani main kuch nae kirdaaron ke jariye phir kasaiylaapan lautataa he, jaruri sabak de jane ko
 Most of the scenes and dialogues in the film are between Vijay Raj and Manu Rishi
 donon ne kamaal kii acting kii he
 When the dialogues are short, the acting is even more effective
 magar aisa kam hi hota he
 Apart from this, Raj Zutshi and Vishwajit Pradhan also leave full impact in small roles
 film kii khaasiyat hai, isaki chust editing, umdaa abhinay or mauju dialog, jo kabhi majaak to kabhi maut kii siharan paidaa karte hai
 But it would have been better to have extended the gap between Samarth and Rahmat
 ek vakt ke baad isamen ekalaap si neerasata aa jaati he
 The background score of the film also sometimes weighs too much
 vijay raaj ne bataur diarector bahut bharosa jagaaya he
 Gulzar's voice lends a kind of purity to the film
 manu rishi ne dialogs main lahore or dilli ke nikhalispan ko jinda kar diya he
 Seeing the film, many people may remember the film that lost the Oscar at the hands
 bosnia harjegovina kii film no mens land
 There also, soldiers standing in two separate sails narrate the narrative of human tragedy through their stories and dialogues
 yahaan bhi kuch aisa he
 But there is a problem
 film ke saath kam, hamaare saath zyada
 There are some dervishes right now
 gulzaar or kuldeep naiyar se
 Some passed away from Khushwant Singh and Yashpal
 jo hamen us paar kii kahaniyaan sunaate the to hook si uthati thi
 Lahore looked like it
 karachi main tafarih kaa ji karata tha
 i am sure that people on that side will also be agitating, agonizing over shopping of nikah in Chandni Chowk
 par kya vaaki
 Is Pakistan just a badass neighbor for us? uske saath kaa saajhaapan bas yaheen thahar jaataa he
 Nothing beyond that
 jab ye peedi guzar jaaegi to bantwaare ke baad yahaan ai to kya unke saath us jameen ke liye paidaa hone vaale maadri khyaal bhi khatm ho jaaenge
 i am reminded of the appearance of PM Manmohan Singh at this time
 badi araju thi unki, pakistan main us gaanv main jane kii, jahaan vah paidaa hue, paley, kuch vakt padhe
 Could not go ek netaa ke aade raajnneeti aa gai
 Think when the PM cannot come, then what is the board of ordinary people
 or tab ye kisse bachate hai, jo aas bachaae rakhte hai
 Sometimes mutual disputes will be less
 kabhi to ham phir ek saath baith gunagunaayein
 Will sing the song of Aman
 or is dua ke dauraan film kii jameen kii taraf dhyaan lautataa he
 i wish there was a tunnel between Delhi and Lahore
 jiske sahare ham andar se jude rahete
 See Delhi or Lahore, so that it is clear that only the land is divided
 or is bantane ke pehle sab kuch saajha tha, he or rahegaa
 i hope that when the film is released next week across the border, then they will think like this too
 haq jamaate, hasil karte, muhabbat ke jariye

 New captain Virat Kohli, who won the first series under his captaincy after defeating England by 15 runs in the Cuttack ODI, expressed happiness at the victory, but also pointed out the lack of openings and bowling
 bharat ne duusare vanade main england ke saamne jeet ke liye 382 ranon kaa vishaal lakshya rakhaa tha, lekin england ne damdaar pradarshan karte hue lakshya ke kaaphi kareeb tak pahunchakar 15 ranon se match gavaan baitha
 After the match, Captain Kohli said, "two players Ashwin and Jadeja had done a great performance in the Test series earlier, even today, they came forward and took the front and if they don't get us a wicket at the right time, then i don't know what the match is about
 Would have happened ' kohli ne kaha, 'main sirf yahi kahana chaahunga ki hamane apni kshamta kaa 75 fisadi hi diya
 In fact, the Indian team came out to bat after losing the toss and had lost three important wickets till the score of 25
 lekin iske baad yuvaraj singh (150) or purv captain mahendra singh dhoni (134) ne tufaani saajhedaari karte hue team ko bade score tak pahunchaaya
 Kohli praised the century innings of Yuvraj Singh and Mahendra Singh Dhoni
 lekin vah sheersh kram ke pradarshan se naakhush dikhe or unhone kaha ki champions trophy se pehle behatar sangyojan taiyaar karne ke liye england ke khilaaf teesraa vanade mahatvapurn hoga
 Kohli said after the match, 'it is very good for us to win the series just before the Champions Trophy
 hamane match kaa samaapan jahaan kiya usase spasht he ki hamane shuruyaat main jo kiya vah acchhee ballebaaji nahin he, hamen sarvshereshth salaami jodi paane ke liye abhi kaam karnaa hoga
 Defending the bowlers, Kohli said, "we knew we would have to take wickets but we were bowling at the most difficult time of the day
" khilaadiyon ne vastav main apana jajba dikhaaya
 Finally we made a good comeback
 champions trophy se pehle shrinkhalaa jeetna mahatvapurn he
 It is now important for us to present ourselves better and prepare the best salute pair '
 vahiin england ke captain eon morgan ne kaha, 'ham phir se apana sarvshereshth pradarshan nahin kar paae
 It is disappointing not to get so close and win
 dhoni or yuvaraj ke liye gendbaaji karnaa mushkil tha
 We presented a good challenge later
 hamen vishwaas tha ki ham lakshya hasil kar sakate hai'

 The distance from the capital Delhi to Patna is over 1,000 km
 lekin 10 farvari ko jaise hi arvind kejariwal kii aam aadmi party ne pradhanmantri narendra modi kii bijepi ko dilli vidhansabha chunaav main dhul chataayee to aisa laga ki nitish kumaar ke liye yah duuri chamatkaarik rup se kam ho gai he
 After achieving the reign of development, good governance and law and order after the lalu-rabri Raj in Bihar for years, former Chief Minister Nitish seemed to have come to his former avatar while addressing the media
 pichley saal june main bijepi ke saath apane rishte todane ke baad se ve lagaataar apane siyaasi bhavishya ko taul rahe the
 On February 10, Nitish weighed one word and said, "delhi's election results have given a message that the impact is more than the national capital
" ham bihar main dilli ke parinaamon ko doharaaenge
 That same evening, he also wore a white and white muffler on the lines of Kejriwal
 in pratikon ko agar ekbargi darkinar kar den to aisa lagata he ki dilli ko bihar main doharaa paanaa abhi dur kii kaudi he
 Somewhere more than 1,000 km away, the distance between Delhi and Patna
 agle hi din 11 farvari ko kejariwal or nitish, donon ne raashtrapati pranab mukherjee se raashtrapati bhawan main mulaakaat kii—kejariwal kii mulaakaat sarkaar banane se pehle kii shishtataa thi to nitish bihar main sarkaar banane kii ummid main apane vidhayakon kii parade karaane ke liye unhen dilli laae the
 Kejriwal had come riding his wave of victory, but Nitish's head was clouded that morning when the Patna High Court banned him from being made the leader of the JD (U) Legislature Party
 kejariwal ko jahaan ek laabh yah he ki unhen ab dushman ban chuke doston kaa boj nahin dhonaa padegaa, vahiin nitish ke saath dikkat yah he ki unhen pehle dost rahe or phir dushman se dost bane lalu prasad yadav ke saath hi jeena hoga jinaki aadat peeche baithkar remote control se gaadi chalaane kii rahi he or ek saajhedaar ke taur par ve jedy(you) ke liye nirnaayak bhi hai
 Apart from this, there is also the burden of Jitanram Manjhi on his head, whom Nitish gave his place on his trust, but nowadays he seems to be close to BJP and is trying to fly the Mahadalit vote bank
 jaateey samikarnon main uljhi bihar kii raajnneeti kaa sidhaa-sa ganit he: nitish ko agar lalu ke saath rahakar 14 fisadi yadav voton kaa phayda hoga to maanjhi ko bihar ke mukhyamantri kii kursi se utaarne par unke saamne 15 fisadi mahadalit vot ko khone kaa khatra bhi he
 Mahadalit may be upset with the JD (U) by removing the leader of his community
 agar nitish ne votaron kaa bharosa dobaaraa jeetne ke liye koi kadam nahin uthaaya to unke haath se baaji nikalnaa swaabhaavik he
 Keep in mind that assembly elections in Bihar are to be held in october-november
 nitish ke liye 2010-13 ke un gauravshaalee dinon kii sthiti main laut paanaa mumkin nahin he jab ve apni tatkaaleen sahyogi bijepi ke saath satta main baari maton se jitkar aae the or unhen nae bihar kaa nirmaataa kaha gaya tha
 To get into that position, they will have to work hard
 june 2013 ke baad se haalanki bihar kii sarkaar puri tarah se jugad tantra par hi chalati rahi or may 2014 main loksabhaa chunaav main karaari haar ke baad to nitish ne mukhyamantri pad se istipha hi de diya
 Manjhi was initially considered his masterstroke by replacing him in the Chief Minister's chair, which was expected to prevent the Mahadalit votes from slipping into the bjp's account, but the move was soon proved wrong
 ab jedy(you) ke ranneetikaar bhi maanate hai ki unka yah akalan galat tha ki siyasat main chote kad ke or bihar kii sabase choti jati se aane vaale netaa maanjhi bina koi sawaal kiye chupchaap sirf rabad stamp bane rahenge
 Manjhi told India Today, "I didn't pay much attention to myself in my career to protect myself, but i couldn't crush my self-esteem forever
" ''maanjhi khud maanate hai ki shuruaati do maah to ve nirdeshaanusaar kaam karte rahe lekin jald hi unhen yah ehsaas hua ki unke haath main bahut bada mauka he
 This bashful Mahadalit leader deliberately decided to leave the previously decided path, showing himself to be the biggest Dalit leader of Bihar and as the days progressed he became stronger
 nitish kumaar ke kheme main is vajah se jaise-jaise bechaini badhati gai, jedy(you) ke mukhiya ne vaikalpik yojana ko lagu karte hue maanjhi ke kaarykaal ko bich main hi khatm kar daalaa jabaki unka vaada tha ki ve vidhansabha chunaavon se pehle tak unhen kursi par banaae rakhenge
 Nitish had feared that the longer Manjhi would remain in the chair, the harder it would be for him to return to Bihar's politics
 is bich maanjhi ne bhi apni siyaasi muhaavarebaaji shuru kar di thi or ve is baat par jor dene lage ki koi dalit hi ab unka uttaradhikari ban saktaa he
 As his confidence grew, Nitish started getting restless
 par unki sthiti lalu yadav jaisi nahin he jinhen 14 fisadi yadavon kaa baraabar samarthan rahaa he
 Nitish belongs to the Kurmi caste, which constitutes only three percent in Bihar
 yahi unka sankat he
 Manjhi and his Mahadalit vote bank were so important to Nitish and Lalu, it makes sense that how carefully the two dealt with the situation
 unhone maanjhi ko bharose main lene or sahajata se satta hastantaran karne kii do baar naakaam koshish kii
 These two leaders are known to always hold a hold in the politics of Bihar, but the condition remained that they were not in a position to take any decision till January 20, when Lalu announced that Manjhi would remain the Chief Minister
 farvari ke pehle saptaah main bhale hi lalu ne apana paksh badal diya lekin ve yah sandesh de paane main kaamyaab rahe ki maanjhi kii kismat kaa faisla jedy(you) kaa aantarik maamla he or is par nitish hi koi nirnay le sakate hai
 JD (U) president Sharad Yadav was brought in to reduce the damage caused during the two-round talks on 6 and 7 February which tried to persuade Manjhi to resign
 sutara bataate hai ki maanjhi ko party main ek sammanjanak pad dene kii baat kahi gai or unke bete ke liye mantripad kaa prastaav bhi rakhaa gaya, lekin ve iske mood main nahin the jiske chalate nitish ko unhen jabaran hataane ke liye majaboor hona padaa
 When Nitish started his social engineering in 2007 — in which 22 of the 22 Dalit sub-castes, except Paswan, were cast as Mahadalits and showered government schemes on him — he managed to break the Dalit vote bank
 they were finished
 ramvilas paswan ke liye yah ek bada jhatka tha
 If Manjhi now goes into the BJP camp, then this decision can be reversed only on Nitish and a re-integration of Dalit and Mahadalit vote bank is possible
 nitish ko sirf maanjhi se dikkat nahin he
 According to analysts, Lalu is also a big challenge for them, whose dependence on the support of the party is going to stay in the government and till the assembly elections
 lalu sarkaar ko peeche se chalaane main maahir hai
 After resigning from the post of Chief Minister due to being caught in the fodder scam, he has run the government for years after sitting his wife Rabri Devi in a chair
 nitish kumaar beshak rabari devi nahin ho sakate, baavjood iske unhen lalu ke saath khadey rahanaa hoga jo logon ko yah bataate nahin thakte ki ve nitish ke 'bade bhai' hai
 In return, Lalu will continue to support Nitish because he will be comfortable in handing over his political legacy to his children
 ek baar dil ke oparation se guzarakar or chaara ghotaale main doshi tehraae jane ke kaaran chunaav ladane par lage pratibandh ke chalate lalu apni viraasat apane teen bacchon main se kisi ek ko thama dene ke icchhuk hai: sabase badi beti misa bharti jo pichhlaa loksabhaa chunaav ladakar haar chuki hai, bade bete tej pratap yaa phir sabase chote bete tejasvi prasad ko
 For now, the only party that keeps an eye on this entire development and is waiting for it is BJP, one of the reasons is its defeat in Delhi
 bijepi ke varisht netaa or nitish ke kaarykaal main upmukhyamantri rahe susheel kumaar modi kehete hai, ''bihar main sanvaidhanik sankat khadaa ho gaya he kyonki nitish kumaar ko satta kii bhukh he
 They are making unnecessary efforts to pull the BJP in this mess while the fire is on in their house
 ''mana ja rahaa he ki nitish kumaar kuch aakraamak soshal ejineering kaa parichay denge or bhrashtachar nirodhak kadamon ko uthaaenge taaki bachi-khuchi baaji unke haath main hi rahe lekin rajkaaj yaa nitigat morche par kuch bhi karne ke liye saat maheene kaa vakt bahut kam he
 It is really difficult for Nitish, who has been a king for nine consecutive years since 2005 of Bihar's politics, but if anyone can give the necessary social and political engineering at this time, he is Nitish
 vaise bhi, ve ek prashikshit electrical ejeeniyar hai
 His prudence and foresight will be proved by overcoming this political crisis

 jaipur ke nahargarh kile kii diwaar par shuukravaar subah 40 varshiya chetan kumaar saini kii laash lataki mili
 Initially, by showing the things written by coal on the wall of the fort, the media told the news that Chetan had committed suicide, but the place where the corpse was found, some such provocative things have been written on the rocks and stones of the fort
 jo is ore ishaara karti hai ki ye suicide nahin balki murder tha
 Initial media reports showed that Chetan had committed suicide against the Padmavati film going on in Rajasthan and all over the country, as the film Padmavati was mentioned in the coalitions
 haalanki, jab is baat kii kareeb se padtaal kii gai to maamla kuch or najar aayaa
 The words written on the rocks of the fort were not against the film, but against the people opposing the film
 media ne bhi us baat ko hilite kiya jisamen kile kii ek chattan par likhaa paaya gaya ki, "ham sirf putale nahin latakaate padmavati"
 Before this writing, there was a message that Chetan had committed suicide
 lekin kile kii chattan par likhi ye baat adhuri thi
 Apart from this, similar things were found written on 10 more rocks
 ek chattan par padmavati film kaa virodh par rahe logon par tanj kasate hue likhaa he ki, "padmavati kaa virodh karne waalo, ham kile se sirf putale nahin latakaate" ye saaf-saaf un logon par tanj tha jo film ke virodh main putale jala rahe hai, khaskar shri rajput karani sena
 "chetan Tantrik is written in two places
 ek jagah par tantric to ek jagah par chetan tantric maaraa gaya"
 It is clear that those who killed and hanged Chetan, did not want the matter to be of suicide
 par rukiye
 It does not end here
 ek anya chattan par is hatya ko sampradayik rang dene kii koshish kii gai he
 In which the written things seem to have been written by a Muslim
 chattan par likhaa he ki, "har kafir kaa yahi haal hoga
 Whoever kills Kafir, Allah will love
 " "ham putale nahin latakaate / allaah ke bande
 "apart from this, three such messages have been written on rocks which contain the word Kafir
 do main allaah likhaa hua he lekin inamen ha akshar gaayab he
 After reading all the messages, it is the result that it is not a case of murder but of suicide, there was a well-planned conspiracy behind the murder so that the issue can be made Hindu and Muslim and get extradited

 ) Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, while replying to the allegations of corruption being leveled by the Congress on the Rafale Deal , said that Congress does not have the right to question the deal
 jetali ne kaha ki is deal par jab upie sarkaar ke kaarykaal main sawaal khadaa kiya gaya tab tatkaaleen mantri pranab mukherjee ne yah kahkar sawaalon kaa jawaab dene se manaa kar diya ki yah maamla rashtriya suraksha se judaa he
 So how is she seeking answers from the government on the Rafale deal today
 rahul sawaal uthaane se pehle pranab mukherjee se hi jaakar mil len
 Answering questions on the budget in the Lok Sabha, the effect of GST is over, now Jaitley said that our government has followed the financial discipline for four years and will continue to do so in the coming years
 sabhi bade aarthik sudhaaron ko karne ke baad bhi kor sector growth, demand, industrial data, export data main ab sudhaar aana shuru ho chukaa he
 Speaking on the subject of Aadhaar completely safe base, Jaitley said that it has always been said that it is necessary to abolish subsidy
 aadhaar se sanshaadhan ko bachaane main madad milegi or sabsidi ko bhi durust kii ja sakegaa lekin ab us aadhaar ko khaarij kar dena uchit nahin he
 Jaitley said that the Congress government had brought Aadhaar without any legal implementation
 bijepi ne aadhaar main privesi ko sunishchit karne ke liye puure aadhaar ko kanoon ke daayre main laane kaa kaam kiya he
 Jaitley said that when the Congress started the idea of aadhaar, why is it knocking the door of the Supreme Court against Aadhaar today
 congress kaa jiesti virodh tarksangat nahinthik usee tarah se congress sarkaar desh main jiesti laane kii kavayad kar rahi thi or vah laa nahin pai
 Now that our government has succeeded in bringing it, the Congress is standing against it
 jetali ne kaha ki congress apane kaarykaal ke daur main 31 fisadi tex leti thi or ab 18 fisadi ke neeche laane kii daleel de rahi he
 Singapore also has 7 per cent GST on food and Mercedes 7 per cent GST
 lekin kya hindustan main bhi aisa kiya ja saktaa he? vahiin jiesti ko laane main jaldbaaji dikhaane par jetali ne kaha ki bengal or trinmul congress hameshaa jiesti ke paksh main thi
 This House passed the GST and was passed on 16 September 2016 under the Constitution amendment and the old tax structure could run for just one year
 lihaaja, samvidhan dwaara bataae gaye samay seemaa main hi kendra sarkaar ne ise lagu kiya he
 So the hasty accusation by the opposition has no meaning
 middle class kaa modi sarkaar ne hameshaa raahat dijetali ne kaha is bajet main middle class kaa puraa dhyaan rakhaa gaya he
 They have been given relief through tax rebates as well as good investment options
 vahiin chote or madhyam str ke kaarobaar par se tex kaa boj kam karne ke liye praavdhaan laayaa gaya
 Jaitley said that the opposition is talking about inflation but has forgotten the day when the Congress reached inflation at the time of governments by 11 per cent
 jaruri he long turm capital gen par taxlong turm capital gains kii vakaalat karte hue jetali ne kaha ki yadi koi share kharidta he auki ek saal ke andar use munaafe par bechata he to usapar 15 fisadi tak tex lagane kaa praavdhaan kiya gaya tha
 However, if the shares were held for more than a year, there was no tax
 lekin hamane dekha ki ek badi rakam kaa munafa niveshkon ko lambey samay tak share rakhane par hota he
 Therefore our government has made a provision of tax on this profit to the investors
 khasbaat yah he ki is munaafe kaa bahut kam phayda chote niveshkon ko miltaa tha or bade or vaishvik niveshak iskaa zyada se zyada phayda lete the
 In such a situation, if he gives tax to the government in his profits, what is wrong? On the question of Rafael Derarafel Deal within the scope of national security, he was asked to give information about the Rafale Deal and how much of this deal has been done
 is sawaal ke jawaab main tatkaaleen upie mantri pranav mukherjee ne kaha tha ki rafel deal kii ditels dena desh ke hit main nahin he
 Therefore, at present Congress is seeking to give details of Rafael Deal just to create controversy, while it has itself explained why the details of this deal cannot be made public
 andhra ko special package kii taiyaari jariandhra pradesh ke mudde par bolte hue jetali ne kaha ki andhra pradesh riorgenigeshan act main andhra ke liye ek package kaa praavdhaan kiya gaya tha
 The central government has given most of the funds to the state and all the necessary funds will be given to the child to build institutions
 jetali ne kaha ki special package ke liye taiyaari chal rahi he

 Earlier Kejriwal was seeking Chaturvedi as the head of the Anti Corruption Bureau
 lekin ab unhen oesady ke taur par maanga ja rahaa he
 The tradition is that when the Chief Minister or any other minister makes an officer his OSD, he is not usually denied
 shaayad isiliye kejariwal ne modi sarkaar se is adhikari ko apana oesady banane ke liye chitthee bheji he

 At a time when people are upset due to drought and water scarcity in the country and the state, the Chief Minister's helicopter does not blow away at the time of landing, so wasting thousands of liters of water is like mocking problems

 congress party main badlaav kii prakriya shuru ho chuki he
 The newly appointed general secretaries and secretaries have also taken charge
 prabhaar sanbhaalane se pehle sabhi kii congress upaadhyaksh rahul gaandhi se mulaakaat bhi ho rahi he
 In this meeting, Rahul is advising everyone to change the earlier style of work
 har faisle main kaaryakartaaon ko shaamil karne kii yojnasutron ke mutabik rahul kaa focus kaaryakartaaon ko har faisle main shaamil karne kaa he
 For example, if a new president is to be made in a state, then the person who is traveling around Delhi or the leader of a big leader is not made, instead the general secretary in charge and secretary in charge should talk to the workers and appoint the one who is better
 rahul neni jimmedaari paane vaale prabharee mahasachivon or sachivon se do took kaha ki pradesh adhyaksh yaa pradesh main kisi ahm pad par niyukti kaaryakartaaon se baatcheet karke kii jaae
 Instead of appointing Rahul himself to these posts, he is ensuring his own accountability in future by giving this responsibility to the secretaries
 party kii majbootee ke liye har kaaryakarta ahmasutra bataate hai ki isi naseehat ke bicharahul ne kaha, kaaryakartaaon kii ahmiyat samajhe bina party majboot nahin ho sakati
 Giving an example, Rahul said, how first the RSS worker plays his role as a pracharak, then later his entry is made in the BJP
 isi tarah hamako bhi apane kaaryakarta ko vishwaas dilaanaa hoga ki agar wo mehnat kar rahaa he, to party ke faislon main uski raay bhi lee ja rahi he or baad main behatar kaaryakarta ko sanghathan main ahm pad bhi diya jayega
 'rahul's instructions should be changed' The party's working sources also say that the leaders questioned Rahul's advice, 'how many such posts remained vacant during the UPA government, where the workers could be adjusted
 ' is par sahmati jataate hue rahul ne kaha ve vahi culture badalanaa chaahate hai
 Rahul said that all the posts remained vacant even in Rajasthan, where workers could be adjusted
 is par jab jaankaree lee to pataa chalaa ki wo pad sirf isliye khaali rakhe gaye kyonki jin kaaryakartaaon ko pad nahin mil paaegaa, wo naakhush ho jaaenge or sabhi ko pad dena sambhav nahin
 On this, Rahul said that he would not go ahead and neither would he accept such arguments
 aresas kii vichaardhaara se muqabla karnaa chaahati he congressdrasal rahul kaa sapanacongress cocader base party banane kaa rahaa he
 He remained engaged in this exercise for a long time while in power
 satta main rahete to rahul isamen safal nahin ho sake
 Now, after three years of being out of power, Rahul has again started his efforts after the changes in the party organization
 aakhir rahul aresas kii vichaardhaara ke dhur virdohi hai, jisase takaraane ke liye wo bhi chaahate hai aresas kii tarj par congress kaa bhi cader ho, jiske sahare wo aresas kii vichaardhaara se majbootee se muqabla kar saken

 On 7 February, Lok Sabha MP PV Midun Reddy has also starred in the question

e
 how many recruitments of the Railways came out in four years and keep in mind what has come out this year, then it will be known that during this time, millions of youngsters are waiting for the preparation of railway exams
 How long it must have been
 2014 se lekar 2017 tak group-si or grud kii kul bhartiyon nikaleen 1 lakh 70 hazaakar 134
 If you divide it in four years, then from 2014, the number of recruits will be 42, 533
 2018 main jo bhartiyon nikali hai unki sankhya 90,000 bataai ja rahi hai
 That is, this year, recruitment has doubled compared to the average of the last four years
 kaash rail mantri in bhartiyon ko chah maheene main puraa karke dikhaa dete
 The average time of completion of recruitments would be reduced to 6 months, which is currently 2 to 3 years
 bilkul ho saktaa he
 What an energetic minister like him cannot do

 But students have started messaging about it that someone has gone medical but is not getting the letter, so after getting the joining cadre of someone, it is stuck
 phir bhi maamla aage badha he to chaatr khush hai
 In the Department of Post, the students selected for the post of accountant are growing eagerly when their letter will come

 Their number is 1635 only

 ab aate hai pariksha centre ke sawaal par
 Students have raised questions about many centers
 banaras main hamaare sahyogi ajay singh ne khud jaakar maukey par kai centaron ko check kiya he
 Many centers run in rented computer institutes in small homes
 baithne kii jagah nahin hoti, inkaa pataa bhi mushkil se miltaa he
 The setting in these centers increases the scope of copying
 pehle pariksha subjective hoti thi to skool college main hoti thi, jab se abjective pattern aayaa he tab se computer centre main hone lagi he
 These centers are being outsourced
 varanasi ke cigara ilaake ke is centre ko dekhie
 This is a hardware institute, the examination is also being done here
 chote se jagah main chal rahe is institute main role number get par laga he
 Examination is going on inside
 chaatr kehete hai ki jo bheetar gaye hai ham dekh nahin paa rahe hai ki wo kya gul khilaa rahe hai
 Actually, due to the lack of centers, these examinations run in many shifts and for many days
 is vajah se bhi dhaandhlee ho jaati he or dhaandhlee kii afvaah bhi ud jaati he
 Ajay Singh talked to the coaching manager, you should listen yourself
 ham to ek shahar se bataa rahe hai
 The pictures that students have sent from many cities are horrifying
 aap yakeen nahin karenge itani badi pariksha kaa yah haal ho saktaa he
 When we do not have the resources, then why is there an on-line examination
 varanasi ke cigara ilaake main hi yah doosraa centre he
 a generator is placed on the road and a roll number and seating arrangement are listed on it

 The name of the gate is also hung
 ravi treepathi ji bhadohi se bhaajapa ke vidhayak hai
 We do not say that he has any role, but seeing the name of the MLA hanged outside the examination center, rumors start to gain strength
 unki bliding main agar kiraaye par chalane vaale computer centre main esayssi kii pariksha hoti to chaatr swaabhaavik rup se andeh kar sakate hai
 SSC should be properly examined before placing centers in such places
 uttar pradesh main 12, 460 shikshakon kii bhartee kaa maamla ajeeb mode se guzarataa rahata he
 We have raised the issue of these teachers many times, but several hundred times more than that, these students have demonstrated to protest their demands

 march 2017 tak isaki counselling chalati rahi
 By 18 March 2017, the entire district was cut off and merit list was made
 lekin 23 march ko yogi sarkaar ne in bhartiyon par roak laga di
 Since then, these youngsters have been performing on every occasion
 ye tasviren unheen ke pradarshnon kii he, unheen kii bheji hui he
 Even two and a half months from July 16, 2017 to September 3, 2017, staged a protest at the Lakshman Mela ground in Lucknow
 12, 460 shikshak court se jeet jate hai magar sarkaar se nahin jeet pate hai

 Starred questions were asked on 27 February by CPM MP Mohammad Badruddoza Khan, MP from Musheerabad in West Bengal and CPM MP from Raiganj
 inke kai sawaal the
 The first question was that what is the zone-wise number of vacancies in all class groups in the railways including SC, ST category in the whole country? Thus, what is the reason for the posts lying vacant for a long time? Is the government considering starting a special recruitment drive to fill the vacancies? If yes, what is its details and by when is it likely to be started? Otherwise what are the reasons for this? rail mantri piyush goyal ne likhit jawaab diya he
 Ideally, this answer should have been on the front page of all Hindi and other newspapers, for which even the poor and unemployed pay their hard earned money and buy and read newspapers
 kya aapako pataa he ki railway ke sabhi zone main kul milakar 2 lakh 22 hazaar 159 pad khaali hai
 This figure is as of 1 April 2017
 do lakh karod ke 2 ji ghotaale main kuch sabit nahin hua, magar do lakh padon par bahaali ho gai hoti to aaj desh ke kitne hi berojgaaron ke ghar main khushiyaan man rahi hoti
 The Railway Minister has written in the Lok Sabha that the number of vacancies in the railway is 2 lakh 22 thousand 159
 ab ise aap zone waar dekhie
 It is also placed on the floor of the Lok Sabha in the same reply
 har zone ke chaatr railway kii pariksha kii taiyaari karte hai isliye yah aankada unke liye bhi mahatvapurn he
 Northern Railway has 27, 537 vacancies

 This year the Railway Minister claims that around 90,000 recruits have been released
 agar sabhi 2 lakh par bhartiyon nikal gayi hoti to berojgaar naujavaanon ke liye avasaron kaa vistaar ho jaataa
 Mohammed Salim and Mohammad Badruddoza Khan had another question that how many posts of SC and ST are vacant, then Ministry of Railways has told that 41, 128 posts are vacant in these two categories till 1 April 2017
 kya aap jaanate hai ki railway main bhartee prakriya ko puraa hone main kitna vakt lagata he? railway ke aap kisi bhi zone se pataa kiijie
 They will give an average of at least 2 years and more than three years

 Before being happy to see the headline of an exam, also understand that it will take 2 years to three years to complete
 yani bhartee nikali to he 2018 main, kya pataa puraa hote hote 2019 biit jaae, 2020 aa jaae
 Only students who take railway exams can tell better
 7 farvari ko loksabhaa main saasand pivi midun reddy ne bhi tarankit prashn kiya he
 PV Midun Reddy is a YSR Congress Party MP from Rajampet in Andhra Pradesh
 saasand reddy ke is sawaal main rail mantri piyush goyal ne kaha he ki railway staff kii baari kami kaa saamana nahin kar rahaa he
 You saw
 do saansadon ke jawaab main rail mantralay kahata he ki 2 lakh se adhik pad khaali hai
 In response to Reddy Saheb, the Ministry of Railways says that the railway is not facing a huge shortage of staff
 rail mantralay ne apane likhit jawaab main yah zarur kaha he ki yah sahi nahin he ki 2014 ke baad se koi bhartee abhiyaan nahin chalaa he
 But this figure is interesting
 pehle jawaab hu ba hu pard lete hai
 Since 2014, 79,600 candidates in group-c and 90,534 candidates in group-d have been empaneled by Railway Recruitment Boards and Railway Recruitment Cells respectively
 jawaab main likhaa he 2014 se 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 yani chaar saal main railway kii kitni bhartiyon nikaleen ye hisaab kiijie or is saal jo nikali he use saamne rakhie to pataa chalegaa ki is dauraan railway kii pariksha kii taiyaari main karodon naujavaanon kaa intazaar kitna lanbaa rahaa hoga
 From 2014 to 2017, the total recruitments of group-c and Grud turned out to be 1 lakh 70 Hajakar 134
 ise aap chaar saal main baant den to 2014 se har saal nikalne vaali bhartiyon kii sankhya hoti 42, 533
 The number of recruitments released in 2018 is said to be 90,000
 yani isi saal bhartee pichley chaar saal ke ausat kii tulana main dabl nikali he
 i wish the Railway Minister could have completed these recruitment in six months
 bhartiyon ko puraa hone ke samay ke ausat ko 6 maheene par laa dete jo is vakt 2 se 3 saal he
 Exactly
 unke jaisaa urjavan mantri chaahe to kya nahin kar saktaa he
 Well, it has not happened yet, if Prabhu ji could not do it does not mean that Piyush will not be from Goyal
 lakhon chaatro kii duaen milenge
 Whatever it is, due to the three mps, you have at least some solid data about recruitment in the railway
 isliye inkaa shukriya to banataa hi he
 Is there really a huge shortage of staff in the railways, what does the union say on this
 esayssi kii pariksha hameshaa vivaadon main rahati he
 Its examination centers have also become necessary to know where the examinations take place
 kis tarah ke centre hote hai
 In the meantime, you know that the result of SSC CGL 2015 and 16 examinations came between August and October 2017
 magar janvari biit jane tak inaki jwining nahin hui thi
 More than 15000 students were wandering around
 isi ko lekar hamaari series shuru hui thi
 We told you that the process of joining 11,000 youth has started
 magar ise lekar bhi chaatr massej karne lage hai ki kisi kaa medical ho gaya he magar letters nahin mil rahaa he, to kisi kii jwining kader milane ke baad ataki hui he
 Still, the matter has moved forward, the students are happy
 department of post main acountint pad ke liye chune gaye chaatro kii besabri badhati ja rahi he ki unka letters kab aayega
 On Monday 5 March, when the process of joining the Income Tax Inspector and Tax Clerk in the Excise and Customs Department started
 inaki hi sankhya 1635 he
 These students are very happy
 pehle to pariksha paas kiijie teen saal main, phir paas kar jwining ke liye intazaar kiijie saat aath maheene
 What a torture it would be
 kya aap jaanate hai ki esayssi kii pariksha kin centaron par hoti he
 There are some big centers which belong to IT companies, but you will be surprised by seeing the condition of many centers, how can such a mess happen with the future of millions of students
 ham centre chunane kii prakriya main nahin janaa chaahate magar ham chaahate hai ki aap in centaron kaa muyna karen
 Take review dekhen ki aapke bacchon ke saath kis tarah kaa mazaaq ho rahaa he
 Watch this video first, on 5 and 6 March in Allahabad, students demonstrated against SSC arrangements, took out a rally and staged a sit-in
 inaki raily kaa naaraa he pehle lade hai goron se ab ladenge choron se
 Now come to the question of examination center
 kai centaron ko lekar chaatro ne sawaal uthaaen hai
 Our colleague Ajay Singh in Banaras has himself visited and checked several centers on the spot
 kai centre chote-chote gharon main kiraye par chalate vaale computer institute main chalate hai
 There is no place to sit, their address is also difficult to find
 in centaron main setting ke zarie nakal kii guzaaish bad jaati he
 Earlier the exam was subjective, then the school was in college, ever since the objective pattern has come, it has started happening in the computer center
 in centaron ko out sorce kiya jane laga he
 See this center of Sigra area of varanasi
 ye hardware institute he yahaan bhi pariksha ho rahi he
 In this small institution, the roll number is installed at the gate
 andar pariksha chal rahi he
 Students say that those who have gone in, we cannot see what they are feeding
 darasal centre kam hone ke kaaran ye parikshaayen kai paali main or kai din tak chalati he
 Because of this, there is rigging and rumors of rigging also fly away
 ajay singh ne koching manager se baat kii aap khud sun len
 We are telling from a city
 chaatro ne kai shaharon se jo tasviren bheji hai wo bhayaavah hai
 You will not believe that such a big test can happen
 jab hamaare paas sansaadhan nahin hai to phir aan line pariksha kii maaramaari kyon he
 This is the second center in Sigra area of varanasi
 sadak par janarator rakhaa he or usee par role number or sitting arrangement kii suchi chipka di gai he
 In addition to the Computer Institute, this building has hostels and other business activities
 yahi esayssi kaa centre he
 This building is of BJP MLA
 get par kaa naam bhi tanga he
 Ravi Tripathi is a BJP MLA from Bhadohi
 ham nahin kehete ki unki koi bhoomika he magar pariksha centre ke baahar vidhayak kaa naam tanga dekhakar afvaahon ko bal milane lagata he
 In their bleeding, students can naturally be suspicious if they had SSC examination in a rented computer center
 esayssi ko aisi jagahon par centre dene se pehle thik se jaanch kerani chahie
 The case of recruitment of 12, 460 teachers in Uttar Pradesh goes through a strange turn
 hamane in shikshakon kaa maamla kai baar uthaaya magar usase kai sau guna baar in chaatro ne apni maangon ko lekar dharna pradarshan kiya he
 Not only the sit-in demonstration, these teachers also fought their battle in the court
 vahaan se jeet kar bhi ye haar jate hai
 On 3 November 2017, a single bench of the High Court had asked the UP government that these teachers should be recruited in 2 months
 3 janvari 2018 ko do maheene puure ho gaye magar 12,460 shikshak bahaali kaa intazaar karte rah gaye
 The case was then heard in the division bench
 vahaan se bhi ye 12, 460 shikshak jeet gaye
 This time the High Court asked the UP government to start the recruitment process within 4 weeks
 6 march ko chaar hafte puure ho gaye
 Students do not know anything
 shaayad sarkaar ko pataa ho jo kisi ko pataa nahin he
 The comments 2016 main 12, 460 shikshakon kii bhartee kaa vigyaapan niklaa tha
 Its counseling continued till March 2017
 18 march 2017 tak saare zile ke cat of gaye or merit list ban gai thi
 But on 23 March, the Yogi government banned these recruitments
 iske baad se ye noujvaan har maukey par pradarshan kar rahe hai
 These photos are of his performances, sent by him
 yahaan tak ki 16 july 2017 se teen sitambar 2017 tak dhai maheene lakhanu ke lakshmana mela maidan main dharna bhi diya
 12, 460 teachers win from the court but do not win from the government
 har tarah ke mantri se mil aate hai, saansadon se mil aate hai magar inaki bhartee kii prakriya shuru nahin hoti
 Court order also does not apply
 aap dekh hi rahe hai ki naukariyon kii kya haalat he
 We have come to the 24th episode
 pataa nahin kitne episod tak chalate chale jaaenge, lekin halaat main koi khaas badlaav nahin he
 12, 460 Teachers win two cases out of court, but do not get jobs even after those orders
 rail mantri piyush goyal ne likhit jawaab diya he
 Ideally, this answer should have been on the front page of all Hindi and other newspapers, for which even the poor and unemployed pay their hard earned money and buy and read newspapers
 kya aapako pataa he ki railway ke sabhi zone main kul milakar 2 lakh 22 hazaar 159 pad khaali hai
 This figure is as of 1 April 2017
 do lakh karod ke 2 ji ghotaale main kuch sabit nahin hua, magar do lakh padon par bahaali ho gai hoti to aaj desh ke kitne hi berojgaaron ke ghar main khushiyaan man rahi hoti
 The Railway Minister has written in the Lok Sabha that the number of vacancies in the railway is 2 lakh 22 thousand 159
 ab ise aap zone waar dekhie
 It is also placed on the floor of the Lok Sabha in the same reply
 har zone ke chaatr railway kii pariksha kii taiyaari karte hai isliye yah aankada unke liye bhi mahatvapurn he
 Northern Railway has 27, 537 vacancies
 madhya railway main 19,651 pad khaali hai 17,065 posts are vacant in East Central pashchim railway main 16, 520 pad khaali hai
 There are 15,930 vacancies in North Central uttar pashchim railway main 13, 532 pad khaali hai There are 13,212 vacancies in South East purvottar railway main 12, 670 pad khaali hai
 There are 11,044 vacancies in the North Eastern Border Railway
 dakshin railway main 10,827 pad khaali hai West Central Railway has 10,626 vacancies

 There are 6,878 vacancies in East Coast Railway
 dakshin pashchim railway main 5, 211 pad khaali hai
 There are 898 vacancies in Metro 1 april 2017 tak khaali pade padon kii sankhya 2 lakh 21 hazaar 159 he
 This year the Railway Minister claims that around 90,000 recruits have been released
 agar sabhi 2 lakh par bhartiyon nikal gayi hoti to berojgaar naujavaanon ke liye avasaron kaa vistaar ho jaataa
 Mohammed Salim and Mohammad Badruddoza Khan had another question that how many posts of SC and ST are vacant, then Ministry of Railways has told that 41, 128 posts are vacant in these two categories till 1 April 2017
 kya aap jaanate hai ki railway main bhartee prakriya ko puraa hone main kitna vakt lagata he? railway ke aap kisi bhi zone se pataa kiijie
 They will give an average of at least 2 years and more than three years
 kai maamalon main 4 saal bhi lag jate hai
 Before being happy to see the headline of an exam, also understand that it will take 2 years to three years to complete
 yani bhartee nikali to he 2018 main, kya pataa puraa hote hote 2019 biit jaae, 2020 aa jaae
 Only students who take railway exams can tell better
 7 farvari ko loksabhaa main saasand pivi midun reddy ne bhi tarankit prashn kiya he
 PV Midun Reddy is a YSR Congress Party MP from Rajampet in Andhra Pradesh
 saasand reddy ke is sawaal main rail mantri piyush goyal ne kaha he ki railway staff kii baari kami kaa saamana nahin kar rahaa he
 You saw
 do saansadon ke jawaab main rail mantralay kahata he ki 2 lakh se adhik pad khaali hai
 In response to Reddy Saheb, the Ministry of Railways says that the railway is not facing a huge shortage of staff
 rail mantralay ne apane likhit jawaab main yah zarur kaha he ki yah sahi nahin he ki 2014 ke baad se koi bhartee abhiyaan nahin chalaa he
 But this figure is interesting
 pehle jawaab hu ba hu pard lete hai
 Since 2014, 79,600 candidates in group-c and 90,534 in group-d have been shortlisted by Railway Recruitment Boards and Railway Recruitment Cells respectively 
 jawaab main likhaa he 2014 se 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 yani chaar saal main railway kii kitni bhartiyon nikaleen ye hisaab kiijie or is saal jo nikali he use saamne rakhie to pataa chalegaa ki is dauraan railway kii pariksha kii taiyaari main karodon naujavaanon kaa intazaar kitna lanbaa rahaa hoga
 From 2014 to 2017, the total recruitments of group-c and Grud turned out to be 1 lakh 70 Hajakar 134
 ise aap chaar saal main baant den to 2014 se har saal nikalne vaali bhartiyon kii sankhya hoti 42, 533
 The number of recruitments released in 2018 is said to be 90,000
 yani isi saal bhartee pichley chaar saal ke ausat kii tulana main dabl nikali he
 i wish the Railway Minister could have completed these recruitment in six months
 bhartiyon ko puraa hone ke samay ke ausat ko 6 maheene par laa dete jo is vakt 2 se 3 saal he
 Exactly
 unke jaisaa urjavan mantri chaahe to kya nahin kar saktaa he
 Well, it has not happened yet, if Prabhu ji could not do it does not mean that Piyush will not be from Goyal
 lakhon chaatro kii duaen milenge
 Whatever it is, due to the three mps, you have at least some solid data about recruitment in the railway
 isliye inkaa shukriya to banataa hi he
 Is there really a huge shortage of staff in the railways, what does the union say on this
 esayssi kii pariksha hameshaa vivaadon main rahati he
 Its examination centers have also become necessary to know where the examinations take place
 kis tarah ke centre hote hai
 In the meantime, you know that the result of SSC CGL 2015 and 16 examinations came between August and October 2017
 magar janvari biit jane tak inaki jwining nahin hui thi
 More than 15000 students were wandering around
 isi ko lekar hamaari series shuru hui thi
 We told you that the process of joining 11,000 youth has started
 magar ise lekar bhi chaatr massej karne lage hai ki kisi kaa medical ho gaya he magar letters nahin mil rahaa he, to kisi kii jwining kader milane ke baad ataki hui he
 Still, the matter has moved forward, the students are happy
 department of post main acountint pad ke liye chune gaye chaatro kii besabri badhati ja rahi he ki unka letters kab aayega
 On Monday 5 March, when the process of joining the Income Tax Inspector and Tax Clerk in the Excise and Customs Department started
 inaki hi sankhya 1635 he
 These students are very happy
 pehle to pariksha paas kiijie teen saal main, phir paas kar jwining ke liye intazaar kiijie saat aath maheene
 What a torture it would be
 kya aap jaanate hai ki esayssi kii pariksha kin centaron par hoti he
 There are some big centers which belong to IT companies, but you will be surprised by seeing the condition of many centers, how can such a mess happen with the future of millions of students
 ham centre chunane kii prakriya main nahin janaa chaahate magar ham chaahate hai ki aap in centaron kaa muyna karen
 Take review dekhen ki aapke bacchon ke saath kis tarah kaa mazaaq ho rahaa he
 Watch this video first, on 5 and 6 March in Allahabad, students demonstrated against SSC arrangements, took out a rally and staged a sit-in

 Because of this, there is rigging and rumors of rigging also fly away

 You will not believe that such a big test can happen

 This is the second center in Sigra area of varanasi
 sadak par janarator rakhaa he or usee par role number or sitting arrangement kii suchi chipka di gai he
 In addition to the Computer Institute, this building has hostels and other business activities
 yahi esayssi kaa centre he

 Ravi Tripathi is a BJP MLA from Bhadohi

 In their bleeding, students can naturally be suspicious if they had SSC examination in a rented computer center

 12, 460 Teachers win two cases out of court, but do not get jobs even after those orders
 rail mantri ne loksabhaa main likhakar diya he ki railway main khaali padon kii sankhya 2 lakh 22 hazaar 159 he
 Now you see it zone wise
 yah bhi usee jawaab main loksabhaa ke patal par rakhaa gaya he
 Students of every zone prepare for railway exams so this figure is also important for them
 uttar railway me 27, 537 pad khaali hai 19,651 posts are vacant in Central Railway purv madhya main 17, 065 pad khaali hai Western Railway has 16, 520 posts vacant
 uttar madhya main 15,930 pad khaali hai North West Railway has 13,532 vacancies

 There are 5, 211 vacancies in South Western Railway
 metro main 898 pad khaali hai The number of vacancies as on 1 April 2017 is 2 lakh 21 thousand 159
 is saal rail mantri kaa daawa he ki 90,000 ke kareeb bhartiyon nikali hai
 If all 2 lakhs had been recruited, opportunities would have expanded for unemployed youth
 mohammad saleem or mohammad badaruddoja khan kaa ek or sawaal tha ki anusuchit jati or janajati ke kitne pad khaali hai to rail mantralay ne bataaya he ki 1 april 2017 tak in do shreniyon main 41, 128 pad khaali hai Do you know how long it takes to complete the recruitment process in Railways? Find out from any zone of the railways
 iskaa ausat wo bataaenge kam se kam 2 saal or adhik se adhik teen saal
 In many cases it takes up to 4 years
 ek pariksha kii hedline dekhakar khush hone se pehle yah bhi samaj len ki ise puraa hone main 2 saal teen saal legaa
 That is, if recruitment is out in 2018, what will be the completion of the address by 2019, come 2020
 railway kii pariksha dene vaala chaatr hi behatar bataa sakate hai
 On 7 February, Lok Sabha MP PV Midun Reddy has also starred in the question
 pivi midun reddy wiesar congress party ke saansad hai, andhrapradesh ke rajampet se
 In this question of Sasand Reddy, Railway Minister Piyush Goyal has said that the railway is not facing a huge shortage of staff
 aapane dekha
 In response to two mps, the Ministry of Railways says that more than 2 lakh posts are vacant
 reddy sahab ke jawaab main rail mantralay kahata he ki railway staff kii baari kami kaa saamana nahin kar rahaa he
 The Railway Ministry has stated in its written reply that it is not true that there has been no recruitment drive since 2014
 lekin yah aankada dilachasp he
 First, we read the answer
 2014 se railway bhartee bordon or railway bhartee selon dwaara kramash: group- si main 79,600 or group-di main 90,534 ummidavaar panelabaddh kiye gaye hai
 It is written in response that from 2014 to 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 i
e
 how many recruitments of the Railways came out in four years and keep in mind what has come out this year, then it will be known that during this time, millions of youngsters are waiting for the preparation of railway exams
 How long it must have been
 2014 se lekar 2017 tak group-si or grud kii kul bhartiyon nikaleen 1 lakh 70 hazaakar 134
 If you divide it in four years, then from 2014, the number of recruits will be 42, 533
 2018 main jo bhartiyon nikali hai unki sankhya 90,000 bataai ja rahi hai
 That is, this year, recruitment has doubled compared to the average of the last four years
 kaash rail mantri in bhartiyon ko chah maheene main puraa karke dikhaa dete
 The average time of completion of recruitments would be reduced to 6 months, which is currently 2 to 3 years
 bilkul ho saktaa he
 What an energetic minister like him cannot do
 vaise abhi tak nahin hua, prabhu ji nahin kar paae to iskaa matlab yah nahin ki piyush goyal se nahin hoga
 Compliments of millions of students will be received
 jo bhi he teen saansadon kii badaulat railway main bhartee ko lekar aapke paas kam se kam kuch thos aankada to aa gaya
 That is why they thank you
 kya vaaki railway main staff kii baari kami nahin he, is par rail union kaa kya kahana he
 SSC exams are always in dispute
 iske pariksha kendron kaa bhi haal lenaa zaruri ho gaya he ki pariksha hoti kahaan hai
 What kind of centers are there? is bich aapako pataa hi he ki esayssi sijiel 2015 or 16 kii pariksha kaa nateeja agast se aktubar 2017 ke bich aa chukaa tha
 But he did not join till the end of January
 15000 se adhik chaatr pareshaan gum rahe the
 Our series started about this
 hamane aapako bataaya tha ki 11,000 naujavaanon kii jwining kii prakriya shuru hui he
 But students have started messaging about it that someone has gone medical but is not getting the letter, so after getting the joining cadre of someone, it is stuck
 phir bhi maamla aage badha he to chaatr khush hai
 In the Department of Post, the students selected for the post of accountant are growing eagerly when their letter will come
 somvaar 5 march ko jab excise or custom vibhaag main inakam tex inspector or tex clerk kii jwining kii prakriya shuru ho gai
 Their number is 1635 only
 ye chaatr bahut khush hai
 First pass the exam in three years, then pass and wait for joining for seven to eight months
 kitna torchar hota hoga
 Do you know at which centers SSC exam takes place
 kuch to bade centre hote hai jo iti companiyon kii hoti he, lekin bahut centre kaa haal dekhakar aap hairaan rah jaaenge ki lakhon chaatro ke bhavishya ke saath aisa khilwaad kaise ho saktaa he
 We do not want to go through the process of choosing the center, but we want you to visit these centers
 gauge len
 See what kind of fun your kids are having
 pehle ye video dekhie, elahabaad main 5 or 6 march ko chaatro ne esayssi ke intazaamon ke kilaaf pradarshan kiya, raily nikaali or dharna bhi diya he
 The slogan of their rally is first they have fought the whites and now they will fight with the thieves
 ab aate hai pariksha centre ke sawaal par
 Students have raised questions about many centers
 banaras main hamaare sahyogi ajay singh ne khud jaakar maukey par kai centaron ko check kiya he
 Many centers run in rented computer institutes in small homes
 baithne kii jagah nahin hoti, inkaa pataa bhi mushkil se miltaa he
 The setting in these centers increases the scope of copying
 pehle pariksha subjective hoti thi to skool college main hoti thi, jab se abjective pattern aayaa he tab se computer centre main hone lagi he
 These centers are being outsourced
 varanasi ke cigara ilaake ke is centre ko dekhie
 This is a hardware institute, the examination is also being done here
 chote se jagah main chal rahe is institute main role number get par laga he
 Examination is going on inside
 chaatr kehete hai ki jo bheetar gaye hai ham dekh nahin paa rahe hai ki wo kya gul khilaa rahe hai
 Actually, due to the lack of centers, these examinations run in many shifts and for many days
 is vajah se bhi dhaandhlee ho jaati he or dhaandhlee kii afvaah bhi ud jaati he
 Ajay Singh talked to the coaching manager, you should listen yourself
 ham to ek shahar se bataa rahe hai
 The pictures that students have sent from many cities are horrifying
 aap yakeen nahin karenge itani badi pariksha kaa yah haal ho saktaa he
 When we do not have the resources, then why is there an on-line examination
 varanasi ke cigara ilaake main hi yah doosraa centre he
 a generator is placed on the road and a roll number and seating arrangement are listed on it
 is building main computer institute ke alaava hostel bhi he or duusari vyavsaayik gatividhiyaan bhi chalati hai
 This is the center of SSC
 yah building bhaajapa ke vidhayak kii he
 The name of the gate is also hung
 ravi treepathi ji bhadohi se bhaajapa ke vidhayak hai
 We do not say that he has any role, but seeing the name of the MLA hanged outside the examination center, rumors start to gain strength
 unki bliding main agar kiraaye par chalane vaale computer centre main esayssi kii pariksha hoti to chaatr swaabhaavik rup se andeh kar sakate hai
 SSC should be properly examined before placing centers in such places
 uttar pradesh main 12, 460 shikshakon kii bhartee kaa maamla ajeeb mode se guzarataa rahata he
 We have raised the issue of these teachers many times, but several hundred times more than that, these students have demonstrated to protest their demands
 sirf dharna pradarshan hi nahin balki in shikshakon ne apni ladaai adaalat main bhi ladi
 They also lose by winning from there
 3 november 2017 ko hoicourt ke single bench ne upi sarkaar se kaha tha ki 2 maheene main in shikshakon kii bhartee ho jaani chahie
 Two months were completed on 3 January 2018, but 12,460 teachers were waiting for reinstatement
 phir yah maamla division bench main suna gaya
 From there also these 12, 460 teachers won
 is baar hoicourt ne upi sarkaar se kaha ki 4 hafte ke bheetar bhartee kii prakriya shuru kiijie
 Four weeks were completed on 6 March
 chaatro ko kuch pataa nahin he
 Perhaps the government knows what no one knows
 tippaniyan In 2016, advertisements for the recruitment of 12, 460 teachers were released
 march 2017 tak isaki counselling chalati rahi
 By 18 March 2017, the entire district was cut off and merit list was made
 lekin 23 march ko yogi sarkaar ne in bhartiyon par roak laga di
 Since then, these youngsters have been performing on every occasion
 ye tasviren unheen ke pradarshnon kii he, unheen kii bheji hui he
 Even two and a half months from July 16, 2017 to September 3, 2017, staged a protest at the Lakshman Mela ground in Lucknow
 12, 460 shikshak court se jeet jate hai magar sarkaar se nahin jeet pate hai
 Meet all types of ministers, meet mps, but their recruitment process does not begin
 court kaa aadesh bhi lagu nahin ho pota he
 You are watching what is the condition of jobs
 ham 24 wein episod tak aa chuke hai
 Don't know how many episodes will go on, but there is no special change in the situation
 12, 460 shikshak court se do do baar mukadmaa jeet jate hai, magar un adeshon ke baad bhi naukari nahin milti he

 Mohammed Salim and Mohammad Badruddoza Khan had another question that how many posts of SC and ST are vacant, then Ministry of Railways has told that 41, 128 posts are vacant in these two categories till 1 April 2017
 kya aap jaanate hai ki railway main bhartee prakriya ko puraa hone main kitna vakt lagata he? railway ke aap kisi bhi zone se pataa kiijie
 They will give an average of at least 2 years and more than three years
 kai maamalon main 4 saal bhi lag jate hai
 Before being happy to see the headline of an exam, also understand that it will take 2 years to three years to complete

 7 farvari ko loksabhaa main saasand pivi midun reddy ne bhi tarankit prashn kiya he
 PV Midun Reddy is a YSR Congress Party MP from Rajampet in Andhra Pradesh

 In response to Reddy Saheb, the Ministry of Railways says that the railway is not facing a huge shortage of staff
 rail mantralay ne apane likhit jawaab main yah zarur kaha he ki yah sahi nahin he ki 2014 ke baad se koi bhartee abhiyaan nahin chalaa he
 But this figure is interesting

 Since 2014, 79,600 candidates in group-c and 90,534 candidates in group-d have been empaneled by Railway Recruitment Boards and Railway Recruitment Cells respectively
 jawaab main likhaa he 2014 se 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 yani chaar saal main railway kii kitni bhartiyon nikaleen ye hisaab kiijie or is saal jo nikali he use saamne rakhie to pataa chalegaa ki is dauraan railway kii pariksha kii taiyaari main karodon naujavaanon kaa intazaar kitna lanbaa rahaa hoga
 From 2014 to 2017, the total recruitments of group-c and Grud turned out to be 1 lakh 70 Hajakar 134

 The number of recruitments released in 2018 is said to be 90,000

 i wish the Railway Minister could have completed these recruitment in six months
 bhartiyon ko puraa hone ke samay ke ausat ko 6 maheene par laa dete jo is vakt 2 se 3 saal he
 Exactly
 unke jaisaa urjavan mantri chaahe to kya nahin kar saktaa he
 Well, it has not happened yet, if Prabhu ji could not do it does not mean that Piyush will not be from Goyal
 lakhon chaatro kii duaen milenge
 Whatever it is, due to the three mps, you have at least some solid data about recruitment in the railway
 isliye inkaa shukriya to banataa hi he
 Is there really a huge shortage of staff in the railways, what does the union say on this
 esayssi kii pariksha hameshaa vivaadon main rahati he
 Its examination centers have also become necessary to know where the examinations take place
 kis tarah ke centre hote hai
 In the meantime, you know that the result of SSC CGL 2015 and 16 examinations came between August and October 2017
 magar janvari biit jane tak inaki jwining nahin hui thi
 More than 15000 students were wandering around
 isi ko lekar hamaari series shuru hui thi
 We told you that the process of joining 11,000 youth has started
 magar ise lekar bhi chaatr massej karne lage hai ki kisi kaa medical ho gaya he magar letters nahin mil rahaa he, to kisi kii jwining kader milane ke baad ataki hui he
 Still, the matter has moved forward, the students are happy
 department of post main acountint pad ke liye chune gaye chaatro kii besabri badhati ja rahi he ki unka letters kab aayega
 On Monday 5 March, when the process of joining the Income Tax Inspector and Tax Clerk in the Excise and Customs Department started
 inaki hi sankhya 1635 he
 These students are very happy
 pehle to pariksha paas kiijie teen saal main, phir paas kar jwining ke liye intazaar kiijie saat aath maheene
 What a torture it would be
 kya aap jaanate hai ki esayssi kii pariksha kin centaron par hoti he
 There are some big centers which belong to IT companies, but you will be surprised by seeing the condition of many centers, how can such a mess happen with the future of millions of students
 ham centre chunane kii prakriya main nahin janaa chaahate magar ham chaahate hai ki aap in centaron kaa muyna karen
 Take review dekhen ki aapke bacchon ke saath kis tarah kaa mazaaq ho rahaa he
 Watch this video first, on 5 and 6 March in Allahabad, students demonstrated against SSC arrangements, took out a rally and staged a sit-in
 inaki raily kaa naaraa he pehle lade hai goron se ab ladenge choron se
 Now come to the question of examination center
 kai centaron ko lekar chaatro ne sawaal uthaaen hai
 Our colleague Ajay Singh in Banaras has himself visited and checked several centers on the spot
 kai centre chote-chote gharon main kiraye par chalate vaale computer institute main chalate hai
 There is no place to sit, their address is also difficult to find
 in centaron main setting ke zarie nakal kii guzaaish bad jaati he
 Earlier the exam was subjective, then the school was in college, ever since the objective pattern has come, it has started happening in the computer center
 in centaron ko out sorce kiya jane laga he
 See this center of Sigra area of varanasi
 ye hardware institute he yahaan bhi pariksha ho rahi he
 In this small institution, the roll number is installed at the gate
 andar pariksha chal rahi he
 Students say that those who have gone in, we cannot see what they are feeding
 darasal centre kam hone ke kaaran ye parikshaayen kai paali main or kai din tak chalati he
 Because of this, there is rigging and rumors of rigging also fly away
 ajay singh ne koching manager se baat kii aap khud sun len
 We are telling from a city
 chaatro ne kai shaharon se jo tasviren bheji hai wo bhayaavah hai
 You will not believe that such a big test can happen
 jab hamaare paas sansaadhan nahin hai to phir aan line pariksha kii maaramaari kyon he
 This is the second center in Sigra area of varanasi
 sadak par janarator rakhaa he or usee par role number or sitting arrangement kii suchi chipka di gai he
 In addition to the Computer Institute, this building has hostels and other business activities
 yahi esayssi kaa centre he
 This building is of BJP MLA
 get par kaa naam bhi tanga he
 Ravi Tripathi is a BJP MLA from Bhadohi
 ham nahin kehete ki unki koi bhoomika he magar pariksha centre ke baahar vidhayak kaa naam tanga dekhakar afvaahon ko bal milane lagata he
 In their bleeding, students can naturally be suspicious if they had SSC examination in a rented computer center
 esayssi ko aisi jagahon par centre dene se pehle thik se jaanch kerani chahie
 The case of recruitment of 12, 460 teachers in Uttar Pradesh goes through a strange turn
 hamane in shikshakon kaa maamla kai baar uthaaya magar usase kai sau guna baar in chaatro ne apni maangon ko lekar dharna pradarshan kiya he
 Not only the sit-in demonstration, these teachers also fought their battle in the court
 vahaan se jeet kar bhi ye haar jate hai
 On 3 November 2017, a single bench of the High Court had asked the UP government that these teachers should be recruited in 2 months
 3 janvari 2018 ko do maheene puure ho gaye magar 12,460 shikshak bahaali kaa intazaar karte rah gaye
 The case was then heard in the division bench
 vahaan se bhi ye 12, 460 shikshak jeet gaye
 This time the High Court asked the UP government to start the recruitment process within 4 weeks
 6 march ko chaar hafte puure ho gaye
 Students do not know anything
 shaayad sarkaar ko pataa ho jo kisi ko pataa nahin he
 The comments 2016 main 12, 460 shikshakon kii bhartee kaa vigyaapan niklaa tha
 Its counseling continued till March 2017
 18 march 2017 tak saare zile ke cat of gaye or merit list ban gai thi
 But on 23 March, the Yogi government banned these recruitments
 iske baad se ye noujvaan har maukey par pradarshan kar rahe hai
 These photos are of his performances, sent by him
 yahaan tak ki 16 july 2017 se teen sitambar 2017 tak dhai maheene lakhanu ke lakshmana mela maidan main dharna bhi diya
 12, 460 teachers win from the court but do not win from the government
 har tarah ke mantri se mil aate hai, saansadon se mil aate hai magar inaki bhartee kii prakriya shuru nahin hoti
 Court order also does not apply
 aap dekh hi rahe hai ki naukariyon kii kya haalat he
 We have come to the 24th episode
 pataa nahin kitne episod tak chalate chale jaaenge, lekin halaat main koi khaas badlaav nahin he
 12, 460 Teachers win two cases out of court, but do not get jobs even after those orders
 1 april 2017 tak khaali pade padon kii sankhya 2 lakh 21 hazaar 159 he
 This year the Railway Minister claims that around 90,000 recruits have been released
 agar sabhi 2 lakh par bhartiyon nikal gayi hoti to berojgaar naujavaanon ke liye avasaron kaa vistaar ho jaataa
 Mohammed Salim and Mohammad Badruddoza Khan had another question that how many posts of SC and ST are vacant, then Ministry of Railways has told that 41, 128 posts are vacant in these two categories till 1 April 2017
 kya aap jaanate hai ki railway main bhartee prakriya ko puraa hone main kitna vakt lagata he? railway ke aap kisi bhi zone se pataa kiijie
 They will give an average of at least 2 years and more than three years
 kai maamalon main 4 saal bhi lag jate hai
 Before being happy to see the headline of an exam, also understand that it will take 2 years to three years to complete
 yani bhartee nikali to he 2018 main, kya pataa puraa hote hote 2019 biit jaae, 2020 aa jaae

 yani isi saal bhartee pichley chaar saal ke ausat kii tulana main dabl nikali he
 i wish the Railway Minister could have completed these recruitment in six months
 bhartiyon ko puraa hone ke samay ke ausat ko 6 maheene par laa dete jo is vakt 2 se 3 saal he
 Exactly
 unke jaisaa urjavan mantri chaahe to kya nahin kar saktaa he
 Well, it has not happened yet, if Prabhu ji could not do it does not mean that Piyush will not be from Goyal
 lakhon chaatro kii duaen milenge
 Whatever it is, due to the three mps, you have at least some solid data about recruitment in the railway
 isliye inkaa shukriya to banataa hi he
 Is there really a huge shortage of staff in the railways, what does the union say on this
 esayssi kii pariksha hameshaa vivaadon main rahati he
 Its examination centers have also become necessary to know where the examinations take place
 kis tarah ke centre hote hai
 In the meantime, you know that the result of SSC CGL 2015 and 16 examinations came between August and October 2017
 magar janvari biit jane tak inaki jwining nahin hui thi
 More than 15000 students were wandering around
 isi ko lekar hamaari series shuru hui thi
 We told you that the process of joining 11,000 youth has started
 magar ise lekar bhi chaatr massej karne lage hai ki kisi kaa medical ho gaya he magar letters nahin mil rahaa he, to kisi kii jwining kader milane ke baad ataki hui he
 Still, the matter has moved forward, the students are happy
 department of post main acountint pad ke liye chune gaye chaatro kii besabri badhati ja rahi he ki unka letters kab aayega
 On Monday 5 March, when the process of joining the Income Tax Inspector and Tax Clerk in the Excise and Customs Department started
 inaki hi sankhya 1635 he
 These students are very happy
 pehle to pariksha paas kiijie teen saal main, phir paas kar jwining ke liye intazaar kiijie saat aath maheene
 What a torture it would be
 kya aap jaanate hai ki esayssi kii pariksha kin centaron par hoti he
 There are some big centers which belong to IT companies, but you will be surprised by seeing the condition of many centers, how can such a mess happen with the future of millions of students
 ham centre chunane kii prakriya main nahin janaa chaahate magar ham chaahate hai ki aap in centaron kaa muyna karen
 Take review dekhen ki aapke bacchon ke saath kis tarah kaa mazaaq ho rahaa he
 Watch this video first, on 5 and 6 March in Allahabad, students demonstrated against SSC arrangements, took out a rally and staged a sit-in
 inaki raily kaa naaraa he pehle lade hai goron se ab ladenge choron se
 Now come to the question of examination center
 kai centaron ko lekar chaatro ne sawaal uthaaen hai
 Our colleague Ajay Singh in Banaras has himself visited and checked several centers on the spot
 kai centre chote-chote gharon main kiraye par chalate vaale computer institute main chalate hai
 There is no place to sit, their address is also difficult to find
 in centaron main setting ke zarie nakal kii guzaaish bad jaati he
 Earlier the exam was subjective, then the school was in college, ever since the objective pattern has come, it has started happening in the computer center
 in centaron ko out sorce kiya jane laga he
 See this center of Sigra area of varanasi
 ye hardware institute he yahaan bhi pariksha ho rahi he
 In this small institution, the roll number is installed at the gate
 andar pariksha chal rahi he
 Students say that those who have gone in, we cannot see what they are feeding
 darasal centre kam hone ke kaaran ye parikshaayen kai paali main or kai din tak chalati he
 Because of this, there is rigging and rumors of rigging also fly away
 ajay singh ne koching manager se baat kii aap khud sun len
 We are telling from a city
 chaatro ne kai shaharon se jo tasviren bheji hai wo bhayaavah hai
 You will not believe that such a big test can happen
 jab hamaare paas sansaadhan nahin hai to phir aan line pariksha kii maaramaari kyon he
 This is the second center in Sigra area of varanasi
 sadak par janarator rakhaa he or usee par role number or sitting arrangement kii suchi chipka di gai he
 In addition to the Computer Institute, this building has hostels and other business activities
 yahi esayssi kaa centre he
 This building is of BJP MLA
 get par kaa naam bhi tanga he
 Ravi Tripathi is a BJP MLA from Bhadohi
 ham nahin kehete ki unki koi bhoomika he magar pariksha centre ke baahar vidhayak kaa naam tanga dekhakar afvaahon ko bal milane lagata he
 In their bleeding, students can naturally be suspicious if they had SSC examination in a rented computer center
 esayssi ko aisi jagahon par centre dene se pehle thik se jaanch kerani chahie
 The case of recruitment of 12, 460 teachers in Uttar Pradesh goes through a strange turn
 hamane in shikshakon kaa maamla kai baar uthaaya magar usase kai sau guna baar in chaatro ne apni maangon ko lekar dharna pradarshan kiya he
 Not only the sit-in demonstration, these teachers also fought their battle in the court
 vahaan se jeet kar bhi ye haar jate hai
 On 3 November 2017, a single bench of the High Court had asked the UP government that these teachers should be recruited in 2 months
 3 janvari 2018 ko do maheene puure ho gaye magar 12,460 shikshak bahaali kaa intazaar karte rah gaye
 The case was then heard in the division bench
 vahaan se bhi ye 12, 460 shikshak jeet gaye
 This time the High Court asked the UP government to start the recruitment process within 4 weeks
 6 march ko chaar hafte puure ho gaye
 Students do not know anything
 shaayad sarkaar ko pataa ho jo kisi ko pataa nahin he
 The comments 2016 main 12, 460 shikshakon kii bhartee kaa vigyaapan niklaa tha
 Its counseling continued till March 2017
 18 march 2017 tak saare zile ke cat of gaye or merit list ban gai thi
 But on 23 March, the Yogi government banned these recruitments
 iske baad se ye noujvaan har maukey par pradarshan kar rahe hai
 These photos are of his performances, sent by him
 yahaan tak ki 16 july 2017 se teen sitambar 2017 tak dhai maheene lakhanu ke lakshmana mela maidan main dharna bhi diya
 12, 460 teachers win from the court but do not win from the government
 har tarah ke mantri se mil aate hai, saansadon se mil aate hai magar inaki bhartee kii prakriya shuru nahin hoti
 Court order also does not apply
 aap dekh hi rahe hai ki naukariyon kii kya haalat he
 We have come to the 24th episode
