 In fact, in the first T20 match played in Hyderabad, Virat Kohli celebrated in a slip-breaking style and equalized his 2-year old with West Indies bowler Kesrik Williams
 lekin, agle hi match main kesaric williams ne bhi viraat kohli ko out kar apana badla le liya

 kohli ne westeindies ke 208 ranon ke lakshya ko bhedane ke liye puraa jor laga diya
 He was infuriated during his unbeaten 94-run stormy innings when Kesrick Williams hit him in the 13th over of that match, also on the middle pitch
 us match ke 13wein over main kohli or kesaric williams aadhi pich par ek-duusare se lagbhag takaraa se gaye the
 Because the bowler was swinging on the ball and the batsmen were busy changing ends for one run

 Williams raised his right hand, apologizing, but Kohli's aggression was unmistakable

 India (in the 16th over) still needed 54 runs from 30 balls

 There were two incidents of robbery and gangrape within 48 hours
 khaas baat yah ki donon main aparaadh kaa tarika ek samaan
 Obviously this is possible only when the culprit is one
 haalanki police ne karrwai karte hue maamle main ek aaropee ko giraftaar kar liya he, lekin sawaal yah ki agar pehali ghatana ke baad hi police karrwai karti to kya duusari ghatana se bachaa nahin ja saktaa tha
 This is true of the state where the credibility of crime has strengthened in the last few days from road to tree, despite this the police and government are silent
 hapur main 19 july ko dhaulana ke narayanpur gaanv main dakaiti ke baad gangrape kii ghatana hui
 Exactly 48 hours later, another incident took place in Bhattiana village of Hafizpur police station
 badmaashon ne donon jagah vaardaat kaa ek hi tarika apanaaya
 Talking about police action, after the first incident, a case was registered and the search for the accused started
 lekin duusari ghatana ke baad police kii saansen phoolne lagi or khud ko raahat dene ke liye hi sahi hafijpur thana police or krime branch kii team ne muthbhed ke baad ek aaropee osman ko giraftaar kar liya
 Police say the accused is a resident of Dehpa of Pilkhuwa police station in Osman district of Hapur
 aaropee ne kabool kiya he ki uske saath 8 anya log donon ghatnaon main shaamil rahe hai
 In the initial interrogation after hunting arrests, they used to make only women, what Osman has told is the story of the high spirits of the criminals
 police ke mutabik osman ne bataaya ki unka gang in donon ghatnaon ke alaava bhi kai vaardaat ko anjaam de chukaa he
 Not only this, there are three gangsters including Usman in the gang who used to make women only their victims
 in darindon ko paise se koi matlab nahin tha
 The gang used to work on the policy of 'skinned our, damdi yours'
 osman ne apane do anya saathiyon kaa naam raashid or jallu bataaya he
 The police are patting their backs after Usman's arrest, but this is actually the result of administrative negligence after the first incident, which invited the second offense
 philhal police kii najar faraar 8 aparaadhiyon par he

 Mice present at home or in the shop often damage things

 The rat picked him up and hid him in the roof of the shop's girl

 Both agreed that even though the pan is tilted towards India, there will be a collision of thorns
 is dauraan kapil dev ne yah bhi kaha ki bharat pakistan match main kitna pressure hota he iskaa andaja isi se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki dhoni ke bal tak safed ho gaye
 Akram Akram is unhappy with the Pakistan team, although he is unhappy about the selection of the Pakistan team
 pakistan cricket team kii lagaataar haar se aahat purv captain wasim akram ne kaha, ‘pakistan ko chahie tha pehle piesel dekh letaa phir team kii ghoshnaa hoti
 On the defeat in the Asia Cup, he said, 'it was a match against India
 wicket hari thi
 He won the toss
 ek-do over ke baad wicket kaa pataa chal jaataa he
 But when he got on the wicket, everyone was in a hurry to kill
 bowling sahi rahi
 But this was not the case with batting
 ’pakistan ke patan se naaraaz hai kapildusri ore kapil dev ne bhi pakistan cricket ke girte str par chintaa jataai or kaha, ‘jab aap acha nahin khelte to aapke team ke prayek cricketer ko saport kii jarurat padati

 Wasim Akram asked him, "our selectors don't know what to do
" ’‘bharat ke log sharajah kii baat nahin karte’jab donon mulkon ke world cap jaise bade toornament main khilne kii baaten hoti hai to yah sawaal jarur uthta he ki yahaan pakistan ne apana khaataa abhi tak nahin kholaa

 He said, 'as everyone knows that the biggest strength of Team India is their batting
 rohit, yuvaraj, shikhar, viraat, raina, dhoni or ab to pandya bhi hai
 Pakistan's team is not like 80s-90s
 tab unka palada baari tha lekin aaj hamaara

 ’bharat-paak match main kiskaa palada baariis sawaal par donon is baat par sahamat the ki us din koun kaisaa kheltaa he us par bahut kuch nirbhar hota he
 However a lot depends on how the pitches will be and where they are playing
 kapil ne kaha, ‘hamaare saat player aise hai jo 15 gendon par 40 ran bana sakate hai
 But it has to be kept in mind that the game is small, just hitting will not work
 main kabhi bhi apni team ko zyada nahin aankna chahta
 Do not want to put pressure on them
 kapil ne die fevorett tiimon ko numberamein is team ko 40 fisadi duungaa
 10 percent New Zealand
 15 fisadi pakistan ko
 Team India have a bigger upper hand in the match between India and Pakistan
 lekin bahut kuch us din ke khel par nirbhar karata he
 He used to win seven out of 10 times in the 80s but today it is the opposite
 bharat pakistan ke bich jab bhi match hua he to ekatarfa nahin hua
 But the pressure in the competition between India and Pakistan is different
 ham jab kabhi khelte the to ham maidan main pichley nattejey par nahin balki us din ke match par dhyaan dete the
 "bowling is strong, batting has to be done
 Kamakram said," Aamir bowls well with the new ball
 ek baar wo set ho gaya to use rokna mushkil he
 Pakistan's player will have to bat well
 agar batting chal gai to bowling ye kar lenge or match nikaal le jaaenge
 Meanwhile, Kapil took a dig at Akram and said, "pakistan has got into the habit of defeat
" ’unhone kaha, ‘donon mulkon ke match main bahut pressure hota he
 Dhoni's beard hair turned white to gauge how much pressure there is in cricket between India and Pakistan
 akram ne kaha, ‘pichley mukaable ko dimag se nikaal den
 Do not be afraid of defeat
 aakhri gend tak laden
 On whether or not the match will take place in Dharamshala, Akram said, "I hope that the team will get the best security which will be better for both the countries

 What would be the DNA of an election? This question just did not come to mind
 darasal aajkal bihar chunaav main itnaa DNA-DNA ho rahaa he ki ye sawaal bhi bin bulaae mehmaan kii tarah tapak padaa
 To understand broadly, suppose that DNA, ie Deoxyribonucleic acid, actually contains biological information and carries forward genetic goodness or evil
 yani aasaan he, chunaav kaa bhi DNA hota hoga to jo saalon se ek chunaav kii mote taurapar rup rekha hoti hogi use aage badhaata hoga
 That is, there should be an opposition that makes the ruling party count, the ruling party should count its own good and work and after hearing all this, the voters can vote
 lekin mote taur par agar kisi chunaav kaa yahi DNA hota he to bihar ke chunaav kaa DNA to puraa gadabada gaya lagata he
 Now you see for yourself, the opposition (lalu Yadav) who has been out of power for the last ten years and he should count the shortcomings of power the most by law, he is praising the ruling party by beating his heart
 RJD ke har netaa ne man main nitish kumaar kii sarkaar kii bakhiya udhedane ke liye na jane kitne alankaaron se susajjit bayaan taiyaar rakhe honge, lekin sab dhare ke dhare rah gaye

 Not everyone wants it, he is busy praising Nitishji
 ab bihar chunaav ke DNA kaa ek doosraa gadabadaya pahalu bhi samaj lijie
 Nitish Kumar, who has been in the Chief Minister's chair for nearly nine years out of ten, instead of counting his work, is busy counting how the Prime Minister sitting at the center has cheated the people of the country and now how to cheat Bihar Have been

 bihar chunaav main muddon kaa bhi kamobesh yahi haal he
 Which is part of the tradition is not part of this Bihar election
 or isiilie raajnneetik rup se jaagruk maane jane vaale bihar ke voter ko samajhnaa hoga ki takreeban 61 fisadi kii sakshartaa vaale bihar main, jahaan 40 fisadi aabaadi to sidhe-sidhe ye nahin samajhati ki DNA hota kya he or jo baaki kii 61 fisadi aabaadi he usamen se bhi DNA ke bare main jaankaree rakhane waalon kaa bhi aankada bahut bada nahin hoga, vahaan DNA chunaav kaa mudda kyon ban rahaa he yaa banaaya ja rahaa he
 The election DNA may be messing up, but if the voting DNA is not messed up and votes are given only by looking at development and development, then everything will be solved automatically
 mote taur par samajhane ke liye maan lijie ki DNA yani Deoxyribonucleic acid darasal biological jaankariyaan rakhata he or anuvaanshik achchhaiyaan yaa buraaiyaan aage badhaata he
 That is, if there is a DNA of the election too, then for years there will be a rough outline of an election and it will be carried forward
 yani, ek vipaksh ho jo satta paksh ko galiyaaye, satta paksh apni kuubiyaan or kaam ginaae or is sab ko sunakar voter vot daal aae
 But broadly, if this is the DNA of an election, then the DNA of Bihar election seems to have gone awry
 ab aap khud dekhie, jo vipaksh (lalu yadav) beete das saal se satta se baahar he or use kaayade se sabase zyada satta kii kamiyaan ginani chahie, wo man markar satta paksh kii taareef kar rahaa he
 Every leader of the RJD must have kept in mind how many elaborately decorated statements were prepared to unleash Nitish Kumar's government, but all remained mired
 siyasat kii majaburi he ki party pramukh lalu yadav ne chunaav se ain pehle nitish kumaar se galabahiyaan kar leen, to kaaryakarta se lekar pravaktaa tak
 
 sab chahen na chahen, nitish ji kii taareef main jute hai
 Now, understand another messy aspect of the DNA of Bihar election
 das main se lagbhag nau saal mukhyamantri kii kursi par rahe nitish kumaar yani satta paksh, apana kaam ginane kii bajaae ye ginane main juta he ki kendra main baithe pradhanmantri ji ne desh kii janata ko kaise thaga he or ab bihar ko kaise thagne kii yojana bana rahe hai
 But they also have helplessness
 in das saalon kii satta main se lagbhag aath saal aise rahe jab bijepi nitish sarkaar kaa hissaa rahi
 If Nitish Kumar counts the work of the initial five years, then the BJP will have to give half the credit directly and if the book is kept for five years of the second term, then the credit of bjp's share also comes to the fore
 itnaa hin nahin, un jithan ram maanjhi ke kaam ko bhi nazarandaaz karke report card bananaa he jo ab NDA kaa hissaa hai
 And so Nitish ji has put more power on issues like DNA, mess of center package and word withdrawal
 itnaa hi nahin, ek dikkat or he unki ki jis lalu yadav ke jangal raaj se bachaane kaa maseehaa wo khud ko bataakar lagaataar vikaas purush kaa tamgaa hasil karte rahe wo lalu ji bhi ab unheen kii naav par baithe hai
 This means that the issue also went away by hand
 udhar, bijepi kii dikkat bhi kamobesh nitish ji jaisi hi he
 If she rejects Nitish Kumar's work completely, she also rejects her own work done by staying with him
 beete do saal ke kaam ko khaarij karti he to phir un jithan ram maanjhi ke kaam ko kachare main phenk detii he jise usne is chunaav main apana saathi bana rakhaa he
 And if the work of the center is counted then people can ask where are the good days and black money brother? That is, there is no other option for the BJP than to contest elections by calling Nitish Kumar a fraud and opportunistic? uff!! koun kahata he ki shina vora murder cese hi bahut ulajhaa hua he
 Issues in Bihar elections are more or less the same
 jo parampara kaa hissaa he wo is bihar chunaav kaa hissaa nahin he
 And that's why the voters of Bihar, who are considered politically aware, have to understand that in Bihar with a literacy of around 61 percent, where 40 percent of the population does not directly understand what DNA is and in the remaining 61 percent of the population
 Even the data of those who know about DNA will not be very big, why is there the issue of DNA election being made or being made
 chunaav kaa DNA bhale gadabada rahaa ho lekin agar voting kaa DNA nahin gadbadaaye or vikaas or sirf vikaas ko dekhakar hin vot paden to sab khud ba khud sulajh jayega
 Now you see for yourself, the opposition (lalu Yadav) who has been out of power for the last ten years and he should count the shortcomings of power the most by law, he is praising the ruling party by beating his heart
 RJD ke har netaa ne man main nitish kumaar kii sarkaar kii bakhiya udhedane ke liye na jane kitne alankaaron se susajjit bayaan taiyaar rakhe honge, lekin sab dhare ke dhare rah gaye
 Political compulsion is that party chief Lalu Yadav had mistaken Nitish Kumar just before the election, from worker to spokesperson
 
 Not everyone wants it, he is busy praising Nitishji
 ab bihar chunaav ke DNA kaa ek doosraa gadabadaya pahalu bhi samaj lijie
 Nitish Kumar, who has been in the Chief Minister's chair for nearly nine years out of ten, instead of counting his work, is busy counting how the Prime Minister sitting at the center has cheated the people of the country and now how to cheat Bihar Have been
 par unki bhi majaburi he

 nitish kumaar agar shuruuaati paanch saal ke kaamkaaj ko ginate hai to sidhe-sidhe aadha shrey bijepi ko bhi dena hoga or agar duusare kaarykaal ke paanch saal kaa hisaab kitaab rakhte hai to bhi bijepi ke hisse kaa shrey saamne aa khadaa hota he

 Before the Lok Sabha elections, the trump card of the Congress could not be played in Jind by-election in Haryana
 loksabhaa chunaav se pehle congress kii haryana main jeet lay banane kii koshish naakaam rahi or is tarah se randeep surajevaala kii haar ne congress ko bada jhatka diya he
 In Haryana, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won the Jind assembly seat by-election in the counting of votes released on Thursday
 jind main jis tarah se congress kii taiyaari thi, uske hisaab se aisa lag rahaa tha ki randeep surajevaala kuch kamaal karenge or haryana kii raajnneeti main congress ke liye ek ummid kii kiran banakar ubharenge
 But in Jind, Haryana, Surjewala failed to repeat the history that the Congress party had hoped for
 darasal, saal 1972 ke baad koi jat samudaay kaa pratyaashee jind main chunaav nahin jeet paaya he
 It seemed from Randeep Surjewala's candidature that Jind's record would be broken this time, but even today no leader of the Jat community could win and this record was retained
 bataa den ki randeep surajevaala congress ke diggaj netaa hai or jat samudaay se hi aate hai
 Randeep Surjewala finished third in Jind assembly by-election
 jind vidhansabha chunaav main bhaajapa ummidavaar krishna laal midda ne 12248 voton se jeet darj kii he
 Digvijay Singh Chautala of Jananayak Janata Party (JJP) finished second
 yani bijepi number ek, jejepi number do or congress nabanr teen party rahi
 The Indian National Lok Dal (INLD), which had won this seat in the last two elections, could not save its bail from being forfeited this time
 inelo ne umed singh ko ummidavaar ke rup main utaara tha
 The by-election has been held after the death of two-time INLD MLA Hari Chand Middha, whose son Krishna Middha contested on a BJP ticket
 upachunaav ke liye matdaan 28 janvari ko hua tha jisamen 1
 Nearly 76 percent of the 72 lakh voters exercised their franchise
 loksabhaa or vidhansabha chunaavon ke maddenjar yah chunaav sabhi chaar pramukh dalon sattarudh bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa), congress, indian neshnal lokdal (inelo) or haal hi main sthapit jananaayak janata party (jejepi) ke liye ek pariksha thi
 Who received how many votes: INLD - 3454 congress - 22740 BJP - 50566 jejepi - 37631 LSP - 13582 nota - 345 Significantly, a few days ago, Kailash Vijayvargiya's son Akash, who is an MLA, attacked an officer with a bat
 ghatana kaa video viral hone ke baad akaash ke upar maamla darj kar unhen giraftaar kar liya gaya
 At the same time, the BJP suffered a lot after this incident and later sources reported that Home Minister Amit Shah has sought a report of the incident
 vahiin jis adhikari par akaash ne hamalaa kiya tha unhen blad pressure or tanaav ke chalate aspataal main bhartee karwaanaa padaa
 Akash is currently in judicial custody till 7 July

 Pakistan has once again started the old raga with Osama bin Ladenko
 pakistan ne is baat se inkaar kiya he ki use alqaida sargana osama bin laden ke paak main chhipe hone ke sambandh main koi jaankaree thi
 Osama was killed by the US in 2011 during a secret operation in Abbottabad in khyber-pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan
 osama vahaan behad oonchi deevaaron se ghire ek bade or aaleeshaan ghar main rah rahaa tha
 According to the report of Pakistani newspaper 'dawn', Pakistan Foreign Ministry spokesman Qazi Khalilullah said that the country had no information about Osama's presence in Abbottabad

 This was a major agreement
 According to Seymour, "america was assisted by Pakistan's information about Osama's whereabouts, but later the campaign was exposed in such a way that the country looked like a villain
" ' osama tak pahunchane ke liye pakistan kii madad ke bare main puche jane par semour ne kaha, 'haa, unhone madad kii, puri madad kii, yah ek bada samjhauta tha
 The Seymour report was published in the London Review of Books on Sunday, in which he called America's so-called official 'operation Neptune Spear' imaginary and concocted
 is bich, white house ne somvaar ko is report ko 'niraadhaar' bataate hue khaarij kar diya
 At the same time, Seymour refuted the claim that the US intelligence agency CIA and other agencies for Osama had colluded with the Pakistani army

 Poonam wrote a ton of tons congratulating Sachin on Twitter! Awesome! Congrats sachin! @ipoonampandey wrote Tweethearts addressing his followers !! 
 
 ci had told u last night that Sachin will get his 100th ton today
 sabase dilachasp baat jo punam ne twitor par likhi he wo yah he ki sachin ke is mahashatak ke liye unhone rahul gandhi ko dhanyavad kaha he
 @ipoonampandey wrote that if Rahul's grandmother Indira Gandhi had not made Bangladesh, then perhaps this great century of Sachin would not have happened today
 ( Thanks to Rahul Gandhi for Tendulkar's 100th 100
 Had his grandmother not created Bangladesh, Sachin would not have got his ton!)

 Two days ago, the Railways released CCTV footage in which they are seen boarding the Rajdhani Express along with two of their colleagues
 isse pehle sarfaraj alam ne daawa kiya tha ki 17 janvari ko unhone rajdhani train main safar nahin kiya tha
 His claim was falsified by CCTV footage
 isse pehle mukhyamatri nitish kumaar ne kaha tha ki jediu apane vidhayak sarfaraaj alam ke khilaaf karrvaai karegi
 Nitish Kumar gave his response on the issue in Rajdhani Patna on Saturday and clarified that whatever Alam's behavior in Rajdhani Express cannot be defended
 vidhayak sarfaraaj alam par aarope he ki pichley ravivaar ko dibrugarh se nai dilli ja rahi rajdhani express main ek dampati ke saath na keval durvyavhaar kiya balki chhedhkhani bhi kii
 Although Alam initially refused to travel in the capital, CCTV footage showed that Alam was not only boarding the train, but his mobile location also confirmed that he traveled from Katihar to Patna

 tippaniyan Nitish Kumar admitted that Alam had sought time to meet him and when they did not come, he doubted that Alam was trying to escape after the scandal
 nitish kumaar ne saafe kiya ki kanoon ko haath main lene kii kisi ko ijaajat nahin mil sakati or police karrwai karne ke liye swatantra he
 Certainly, after the recent grudge on Bihar's law and order, Nitish Kumar has realized that his image has been adversely affected by being silent on the law and order related issues
 lekin sawaal he ki vidhayak ke khilaaf party kab or kya karrvaai karti hai
 Will the party take any action against its second MLA Bima Bharti and MP Santosh Kushwaha? Who helped Avadhesh Mandal escape from the police station

 The comments nitish kumaar ne mana ki alam ne unase milane kaa samay maanga tha or jab ve nahin aae to unka shaq pukhta ho gaya ki alam cond karne ke baad bachane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 Nitish Kumar made it clear that no one can be allowed to take the law in hand and the police is free to take action

 Killing with AK47 has become common in Bihar
 pichley kuch varshon main apradhi kai baar AK47 kaa istemaal kar rahe hai
 AK 47 was used in the murder of former Mayor Sameer Kumar in Muzaffarpur
 samir par hamale main puri magazine khaali kar di gai
 In such a situation, the question arises as to how such an AK47 came to Bihar? On the night of December 17, 1995, for the first time, the weapons were dropped in Purlia town of West Bengal
 parachute kii madad se giraae gaye kuch baxon main bulgaria main bani 300eke47or eke 56 riflein, lagbhag 15 hajaar goliyaan, aadha darjan rocket lanchar, hathgole, pistaulen or andhere main dekhne vaale upkaran shaamil the
 These weapons were handed over to many criminals
 lekin uske baad bhi nepal or bangladesh se taskari kar ye jaanaleva hathiyaar bihar ke aparaadhiyon ko beche jate rahe hai
 But the current case of Muzaffarpur is very shocking
 jiskaa conection jabalpur se he
 According to the information, the retired Armor Purushottam has stolen AK47 from the army depot and sold it in large quantity in Bihar
 is kaam main munger se ek sena kaa jawan bhi shaamil tha
 The young man named Miyazul was in Lance worth in Bagdogra, West Bengal
 jaanch main pataa chalaa ki purushottam laal is gorakhdhandhe ko chalaane ke liye central ordinance depo main tainaat suresh thakur naamak ek karmchaaree kii madad liya karata tha
 Actually, the Ministry of Defense in Jabalpur has many factories and warehouses
 jahaan sena ke liye gola barood or hathiyaar banaae jate hai
 The police also arrested Suresh Thakur
 vah jabalpur ke central ardinance depo main tainaat tha
 He had the responsibility of keeping many useless dangerous weapons, including AK 47, in the warehouse
 aaropee suresh thakur siodi factory kaa adhikari hone ke puraa phayda uthaakar apni gaadi main bekaar ho chuki AK47 churaakar le jaataa tha or shaatir purushottam laal ko de detaa tha
 The stolen worthless AK47 Koshatir Purushottam Lalrajak would have rectified and corrected it and then sold it to his customers from Rs 4
5 lakh to Rs 5 lakh
 purushottam or suresh COD se AK47 chori kar uske alag-alag part karke munger laate the
 While there he was assembled

 The exams were over and the results were eagerly awaited
 hamen lakh taak-jhaank, khufiyagiri karne par bhi kiskaa kya haal hua, iskaa koi suraag nahin mila
 a few days before the results were announced, Lady Shri Ram College put out an advertisement for the recruitment of staff
 college usee varsh (1956) khulaa tha
 There was also a story about its opening almost accidentally
 kaha yah ja rahaa tha ki shahar ke sabase puraane ladakiyon ke college 'indraprastha’ main vittiya sankat paidaa hua to di

 em
 The famous capitalist of the city, Sir Sri Ram, as the member of the governing body of the college, offered to get him out of the crisis
 basharte college kaa naam badalakar 'ladi shriram college’ kar diya jaae
 The rest of the members were also some old nobles and eminent people of the city
 unhen is prastaav par etraz tha
 It was heard that Sir Shriram came out of that meeting challenging that he could open a new college if he wanted to pay as much money
 or ve aisa karke dikhaaenge
 Not only this, he proposed an old professor of Indraprastha College for the proposed college, Dr
 homai dastur se sampark karke unhen principal kaa pad samhaalane ke liye taiyaar kar liya
 Dr
 dastur us samay bombay main rahati thim
 i was his student during my honors, which he had no question of remembering, because time had passed and English was only a subsidiary subject for Hindi Honors students, which was settled in the first year itself
 
 mujhe yah zarur yaad tha ki ve badi smart or kadak swabhaav kii mahila thim
 Hearing her name, she was nervous, but also aroused the belief that she would give importance to Surat-sirat and ability
 sar shriram bhi,jinhen log 'sar’ kam, 'lala ji’ zyaada kehete the, apni nishpaksh gungraahakta ke liye bahut prasiddh the
 Therefore, there was no hope of complete hope

 It was definitely known that M

 When i come first class, late in the morning, there is a jugaad of job somewhere
 vigyaapan sabase pehle ladi shriram college kaa hi aayaa
 By that time the test-results had not arrived
 pet main khalabali machi thi
 It was estimated that moderation has been done, so the Chairman and the members of the committee will definitely know the first class
 kisi se poochne kii himmat nahin thi
 i got it smart
 ek din dow
 Appearing here, i informed them of the advertisement and asked me very politely that if i give permission, i should apply
 'devi ji! pehle riselt to aa jane dijie
 'the answer was found in such a meaningless posture and a loud voice that my senses were destroyed
 maine jab is baat kaa zikr jain sahab se kiya to utani hi nirvikaar mudra main unki pratikriya hui, 'tumhen janaa hi nahin chahie tha
 Don't you know them? ' sahab ke do-took ruukhe-se jawaab se maine lagbhag maan liya tha ki meraa parinaam bahut anukool nahin he, goki parche to achche hue the
 The result came two-three days later

 'mudra is equally meaningless

 i was not disappointed, it would be dishonest to say, because Mrs Sinha gave a much better certificate than that
 maine apni samaj se nishkarsh nikaala ki ve ek baar phir si$rf or si$rf vibhaagadhyaksh ho gaye
 What was going on in his mind, it was later revealed when the college had an opportunity for interview and appointment
 yah baat alag he ki is puure prasang ne mujhamen maanav-swabhaav ko samajhane-parakhane kaa vivek paidaa kiya, jiskaa saath aanevaale samay main baraabar bana rahaa
 The process of opening of Shri Ram College started in the summer of 1956
 us samay shahar main ladakiyon ke liye sirf do college the—indraprastha or miranda
 The naming of Indraprastha was a modern incarnation of the ancient name of the city
 'miranda’ kaa namakaran vishvavidhyalay ke vikhyath kulapati sar morris gwyr kii beti ke naam par kiya gaya tha
 At that time it was possible, no one objected, that the college was opened in independent India
 paisa kisi vyakti yaa trust kaa nahin—vishvavidhyalay ke madhyam se sarkaar kaa tha
 Later there were problems in the implementation of such proposals
 jab vikhyath arthshaastri dow

 ve
 When Rao became the Vice Chancellor of the University of Delhi, he accepted the proposal of the Daulataram Trust with the condition that the college he would open be named after his late wife Pramila
 or college 'premila college’ ke naam se khulaa
 It is later that Dr
 raav ke kulapati na rahane par trust ne prastaav paarit karke uskaa naam badalakar sansthaapak ke naam par—'daulataraam college’ kar diya
 But when the matter arose to open Lady Shri Ram College, there was no such obstacle
 college jis trust ke prastaav par khulaa, uske liye aarthik aadhaar bhi usee ne muhaiyaa karaayaa tha
 In fact, Sir Shriram's personality was among those capitalists of the city who had gained great fame not only in the world of industry but also in the field of education
 shriram college of commers ke sansthaapak to ve the hi, uske alaava indraprastha college, hindu college or ramajas college kii gavarning bodies ke bhi samay-samay par chairman yaa sadsy rahe
 In addition, he established a research center at the University of Delhi called Sri Ram Research Center, which is still located and active on the main University Road
 unke baad bhi yah parampara unke vanshajon ne kaayam rakhi—kaaphi samay tak
 Not only in university education, the family also took interest in school education and the branches of the school opened in Delhi in the name of Sir Sri Ram, are also in Gurgaon
 apni ruchi or sankalp ko saakaar rup dene main lalaji ne der nahin kii
 He hurriedly called Dr
 homai dastur se sampark kiya
 Calling him Delhi entrusted him with the responsibility of the principal of the college and started the process of recruitment of professors for the college
 lalaji us samay sapariwaar 20 kazarn road (jo baad main kasturba gandhi maarg kahalaane laga) par rahete the
 The commercial school building behind the Kotwali of Daryaganj was then fixed for the college
 lalaji apni yojana ko kisi keemat par sthagit nahin karnaa chaahate the
 There was limited space in that building
 bich main bada-sa angan, jiske chaaron taraf galiyaaron main bade-bade class-room
 Outside the big gate, in which ascending three or four steps, right-left corridor started
 dayee taraf vaale galiyare ke kone main ek chota cameraa jisamen principal kaa daftar or uske kuch pehle bade kamare main college kaa da$phtar
 On the left, queues of relatively large rooms for classrooms would begin
 pehle saal to chunki daalila bi

 For the future, Lalaji had made up his mind that B
 from college

 The first batch of students to take the degree will emerge from the new college building
 college main ek aisa holnuma bada cameraa bhi tha jisamen stage kii suvidha thi jahaan sab praadhyapikaon or vidhyaarthiyon kii praat: sabha hoti thi, jise principal sambodhit karti thim
 Later, in this meeting, one of the professors took turns to recite a chosen quote related to conduct or knowledge for the students and necessary information was given
 yah parampara varshon chalati rahi
 Don't know what happens now samay june kaa doosraa yaa teesraa saptaah rahaa hoga jab praadhyapikaon kii niyukti ke liye intervyuu shuru ho gaye
 Not in college - at Lalaji's residence
 intervyuu kaa soochna-patr mila to pratikriya main khushi se zyaada ghabrahat hui
 There was no one in the household who would guide anyone
 dow
 He did not dare to ask anything directly
 maine soochna dene ke bahaane daravaaza khatkhataya to uttar main vahi nirvikaar tatasth-si pratikriya, 'haan, mujhe pataa he
 
 
 Okay
 
 Then come to the interview
 ’maine himmat karke jaananaa chaha ki koi khaas taiyaari kerani hogi?phir vahi aupchaarik berukhi, 'alag se kya karnaa he! jo padhaa-likhaa he, vahi kaam aayega
 'even my angels could not guess what was going on in their mind
 maine lautakar ek baar phir vahi nots ulate-palate jo pariksha ke liye taiyaar kiye the or baaki bhagya par chhod diya
 Arrive at Czern Road on the appointed date and time, as soon as they reach the room where the candidates were seated
 pair tale kii zamin khisak gai
 Twenty-six people came in total
 adhikansh hamase pehle pahunch gaye the
 Because there were more number of visitors from outside
 dilli se to bas ham do hi the—main or santosh
 In a mutual conversation, it was found that two or three of those internal sculptures were the principals of the colleges and most of them had experience of teaching two to four years
 zaahir he, umr main sabhi hamase badi or tajurbekaar
 We assumed that we had no chance
 is bodh ne hamen ek had tak chintamukt bhi kiya
 The interview seemed to be the only achievement for the future
 awaz lagani shuru hui to ek saath do naam pukaare gaye
 The arrangement was that while the first interview was going on, the second one would sit in the gallery outside the room and wait for his turn
 kaaran,us vishaal kothi main kamaron ke bich to duuri thi hi, us holnuma kamare main darvaaze se chalakar samiti ke saamne kii kursi par pahunchane main bhi khaasaa samay lagata tha
 This arrangement used to save some of the committee's time
 meraa nambar choubeesvaan tha
 i felt that the order in the list would have been decided according to the merit of the visitors
 isliye man-hi-man apni aukaat or haisiyat kaa bhi lagbhag nishchay ho gaya
 Whoever went in, the rest would eagerly wait for him
 lautne par bheetar ke maahaul or prashnon kii prakruti ke bare main jaankaree hasil karne kii koshish karte
 Obviously, no one wanted to speak the whole truth
 thik-thik jaankaree sirf board ke sadasyon kii ginati or sanrachana kii hui
 The answer was that the person sitting outside the hall knew when the conversation was going on and when it was over, the details were not understood
 kis aavedak ke saath samiti ne kitna samay lagaaya, isse bhi uski sthiti kaa kuch-kuch andaaza lagane kii naakaam koshish main lage the ham sab
 In a mixed state of great anxiety and curiosity, the waiting clocks were cut
 sabase bada aashcharya to pratiksha kar rahaa tha kamare ke bheetar
 The arrangement for sitting under a crescent window, right in front of the applicant's chair, consisted of Mrs
 Dastur and Sir Shriram sitting in the middle

 The bone-flesh structure behind their almost transparent wheat-colored skin could be easily estimated
 mudra behad gambheer, nazar lakshyabhedi, ek hi nikshep main saamne vaale ko tad lene kii kshamta se las
 As soon as he sat down, he would take stock of the front from the investigative point of view
 aavedan-patr main bhari kuch baton ke bare main khulaasa karaate or phir yadi ichha hui to vishay-sambandhi ekaadh sawaal poochkar baat aage badha dete
 For example, he quoted a line from poet Surdas to a woman, saying that seven of the nine jewels of Akbar had given different meanings to this line, how many can you tell? Apparently, the respondent is missing
 baat do se aage nahin bad saki, vah bhi khinch-khanchakar
 With such questions, they tried not to seek knowledge of the person but to test his presence and confidence
 mujhase unhone koi asuvidhajanak sawaal nahin poocha, isliye ab yaad bhi nahin
 i remember three dialogues even after so many years
 or baton ke bich dow
 Nagendra's famous biography of 'yashodhara' by the nationalist Maithilisharan Gupta, 'abala Jeevan'
 
 
 ’ ke nihitarth par baat karte hue sahasaa kaha ki 'agar main iskaa kram ulatakar kahuun, 'ankhon main he doodh or anchal main pani’ to isaki vyakhya kis rup main karogi?’ yah sawaal itnaa apratyaashit or asuvidhajanak tha ki uskaa uttar soch-vichaar kar to diya ja saktaa tha, sahasaa nahin
 Obviously, my tongue stumbled
 maine jo ulti-sidhi vyakhya kii, usase mujhe khud hi santosh nahin tha
 However, the work of a troubleshooter was dr
 visheshwaraprasad ne
 The intention was not to salvage me and to push me into a deep pit
 unhone sahasaa angrezi main mujhase meri hindi-itar, visheshkar angrezi sahitya kii jaankaree ke bare main poochtacha shuru kii
 They did not know that my schooling was done through English medium, so i had no problem in answering their question in English, nor in referring to any recently read novel
 maine shaayad thomas hardi ke kisi prasiddh upanyaas kaa naam liya, jo sambhavat: unhone nahin padhaa tha, isliye ve maidan chhod gaye
 Last curiosity Principal Drs
 dastur kii thi
 She wanted to know that on the basis of my dance education, i would be able to take responsibility for the cultural activities of the college
 i agreed with great enthusiasm
 zaahir he, is uttar se mujhamen unki atirikt dilchaspee paidaa ho gai
 When we had to go back through this whole process, there was no idea as to what would have been 'good' or 'bad'
 intervyuu dene kaa vah jivan main pehla anubhav tha
 Despite having no special hope of success, the desire to know the result was still there
 dow
 As usual, he hesitated to ask for anything, but did not have to wait long
 tisare hi din niyukti kaa sankshipt-sa soochna-patr haath main aa gaya—nishchit samay or sthaan par upasthit hokar jwine karne ke aadesh ke saath
 The heart started bouncing
 kalpana main yah baat dur-dur tak nahin ai thi ki pehle hi prayaas main hathonhaath is tarah niyukti ho jaaegi
 By then, his slate was absolutely blank
 niyuktiyon se judi uthapatak, sifaarishon kii mahatta or shiksha-tantra kii apni raajnneeti se judi koi ibaarat nahin likhi thi us par
 It was just us, we had an appointment letter in hand and the satisfaction and gaiety that everything happened in such an improper manner

 sinha kii pratikriya behad utsahvardhak thi
 She was very happy
 unheen se baatcheet ke dauraan jaankaree mili ki college main niyukti ek nahin, do hui hai
 Santosh is the second appointment
 bade sahaj dhang se unhone yah bhi khulaasa kar diya ki niyuktiyaan kramvaar hui hai, pehle sthaan par meri, duusare par santosh kii
 Apparently, Santosh was disappointed with this sequence, because he had secured first place in the examination
 kuch dinon tak santosh ke man par is baat kaa boj rahaa, jo berukhi or udaasi kii parat ke rup main uske chehre par lagbhag chaspaan ho gaya tha
 Talk when dr
 sinha ke kaan tak pahaunchi to unhone kuch alhad-si mudra main tippanee karte hue kaha, 'isamen itnaa bura maanane kii kya baat he? agar main hoti to main bhi tumhen hi leti college main
 What happens with a little more number! ”later it was discovered that Dr
 nagendra to usee ko pehle sthaan par karana chaahate the
 He also tried a lot
 par lalaji or principal mere naam par dridhtaa se ade rahe, tab samjhauta is vikalp par hua ki kam-se-kam duusari jagah par ajmer se ai kanta marwaah kii bajaay college santosh ko lene ko taiyaar ho jaae
 Knowing the details of this episode, Dr
 Brain in my mind
 nagendra ke bhitari asamanjas kii gutthi sulajh gai
 His compassionate concern for this orphaned sister of his friend could be understood, which remained equal from the number of marks in the pamphlet to his appointment
 unka mohabhang lambe samay baad hua,jab uske shodh-kaary ke sandarbh main unhen niraashaa haath lagi

 is bich desh ke alag-alag hisson kii tasviir dekhen to plastic bain kii raah aasaan nahin he
 There are many challenges in this path too
 sabase badi chunauti to yah he ki ek taraf jahaan sarkaar ko desh ko single yuj plastic se mukt banane kii baat kar rahi he, vahiin duusari taraf udyog jagat kii naaraazgi bhi mol nahin lenaa chaahati
 This is the reason why the government is giving special attention to public participation for not using it instead of taking tough measures like direct ban
 sarkaar kii koshish he ki pratibandh jaisaa kadam uthaane kii bajaayjanta ko jaagrukkar diya jaae ki vah inkaa upyog hi na kare
 This will automatically close the single use plastic
 isiilie piem modi swayan bhi lagbhag har manch se single yuj plastic kaa upyog band karne kii baat kar rahe hai
 At the same time, a step is being taken to ban single-use plastic in government offices, court premises, government meetings
 plastic kaa vikalp kya?sarkaar kii manshaa ke bich yah sawaal bhi uthne laga he ki plastic kii botalon kaa upyog band hone kii sthiti main inkaa vikalp kya hoga
 Several states have made efforts in this direction in the past, but the results were not encouraging
 isaki ek badi vajahakorporate dwaara plastic pouchamen packing kaa nirantar jari rahanaa bhi he
 When did which state do what? Nearly two decades before the central government campaign, the hill state of Sikkim in northeast banned plastic in 1998 itself
 haryana sarkaar ne bhi san 2013 main single yuj plastic bain kar diya tha
 The Punjab government banned the distribution and recycling of plastic bags in 2016
 jammu kashmir main isi varsh march main single yuj plastic bain kar diya tha
 Most religious places in West Bengal also have a single use plastic ban
 telugana, himachal pradesh or tamilnadu jaise rajyon main bhisingle yuj plasticbain he
 Stopping packing is a big challenge
 The biggest obstacle in the path of single-use plastic-free India is the packing of essential items like shampoo, oil, milk, etc
 everyday
 alag-alag rajyon kii sarkaron ne samay-samay par plastic kaa upyog rokane ke liye kadam uthaae, lekin is baadha kii vajah se un kadamon kaa vishesh laabh nahin mil sakaa
 If a single-use plastic-free India is to be built, the government will have to take stern steps
 kya he single yuj plastic?single yuj plastic kii shrenee main mahaj ek baar istemaal kiye jane vaale plastic, jaise doodh ke packet, pani kii bottlen aadi aate hai

 Because banks only offer a combined figure of submerged money
 'sirf do bainkon ne diya aisa koi lonek ore jahaan sarkaar public sector ke bainkon ko majboot karne kii koshish kar rahi he to vahiin, duubataa paisa unke liye sabase badi musiibat he

 maanjhi sarkaar ne mangalvaar shaam ko cabinet kii baithak main sarkari tenderon main SC-ST ko bhi rigerveshan dene kaa nirnay kiya he
 The biggest question is, how will the Manjhi government's decision to woo the large section of the state will be implemented at all? Jitan Ram Manjhi may not have resigned as CM yet, but JDU has expelled him from the party

 "she was also referring to the wikileaks cable which talks about Advani's soft stance towards the nuclear deal
" rishwat ke aaropon se 10, janpath kaa naam pehali baar joda gaya he
 wikileaks Cable has raised Rs 50 crore
 ke khajaane vaale prasang main gandhi parivaar ke kareebi satish sharma kaa bhi ullekh kiya he ki ve congress ke liye saansadon ko kharidne kii koshish kar rahe the
 Former SP leader Amar Singh mocked wikileaks, saying, "these are Wicked Leaks, not wikileaks
" ''yah ek kaaran ho saktaa he ki vipaksh sansad main vyavdhaan daalane se parhez kare
 The debate over the mps' purchase-scam was dominated by serious arguments and outrage
 makapa ke gurudas dasgupta ne congress ko chetavanee di ki ''bhagya un par meharbaan rahaa he lekin itihaas krur rahegaa
 When NCP leader Sharad Pawar tried to interfere, Dasgupta reprimanded him and said, "you have always been calm
" ab kyon itane samvedansheel ho rahe hai?'' bahes ke ant main pradhanmantri ne jawaab diya, ''main ek baar phir spasht karnaa chaahunga ki 2008 main vishwaas mat ke dauraan congress yaa sarkaar kaa koi vyakti is tarah ke kisi bhi gaiyrkanoonee kaary main shaamil nahin rahaa he
 We have not been involved in any transaction and we have not authorized any person to engage in such transactions
 ''aakhir, 21 or 22 july, 2008 ke bich vastav main kya hua? kya isaki gunj 2ji or usase pehle ke boforce ghotaale kii tarah congress ko pareshaan karti rahegi?manmohan singh sarkaar kii kalai kholane kii yojana jaipur ke saudebaaj suhail hindustani dwaara taiyaar kii gai thi
 Suhail has links with BJP
 atal bihari vaajapeyi sarkaar ke dauraan unhone tatkaaleen kendriya mantri shahanvaj hossain se najdiki badhaai or duusari paant ke rashtriya netaaon se apane sampark banaae
 Soon after the withdrawal of support by the Left Front on 9 July 2008, Hindustani says that he started receiving calls from various middlemen who asked him if he had a "plot for sale"
 '' hindustani spasht karte hai ki iskaa matlab tha ki kya unke paas kuch saansad hai jinhen vishwaas mat ke liye kharida ja sake
 Hindustani says, "I asked him, how much paper will it cost?" Hindustani was surprised by the amount the middlemen gave
 unhone aage isaki jaanch kaa faisla kiya or es
 P
 gupta se sampark kiya, jo ab haryana kader se sevanivrutt iees adhikari hai
 According to Hindustani, Gupta was a close confidant of Haryana Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda
 gupta turant dilli ke india islamic centre main ek cap coffee pine ke liye pahunch gaye or hindustani se saansadon kii suchi ke bare main poocha
 They said they would introduce him to both Hooda and Ahmed Patel
 usee din baad main hindustani islamic centre main sapa netaa udai pratap singh se mili
 Hindustani then decided to apprehend Amar Singh, as there was speculation that the then SP leader Amar Singh was busy gathering the necessary numbers to help the UPA
 udai pratap ne kaha ki amar singh se sidhaa sampark na hone ke kaaran ve ek anya sapa netaa revati raman singh se unhen mila sakate hai, jinka amar singh se sidhaa sampark tha
 Hindustani says that only then his conscience awakened
 unhone india today ko bataaya, ''yah satta kii ladaai he
 Wherever the system weakens, people come to occupy it
 '' unhone sochaa ki parmaanu samjhaute ke liye vot kaa matlab hoga desh ke hiton ke khilaaf america ko vot dena
 So they reached Advani's residence and claimed that the Congress has elected at least 15 BJP mps who can be bought
 hindustani se kaha gaya ki ve adwani ke kareebi sudhindra kulkarni se sampark karen
 Hindustani gave him a list of mps and said, "save your mps
" kharid-farokht puure jor par he or mujhe bhaajapa ke kuch saansadon ko unke kheme main laane ke liye paison kaa laalach diya gaya he
 "I knew Hindustani as a sensible worker," says Kulkarni
 isliye unke daawey par shaq karne kii koi vajah nahin thi
 "he asked Hindustani," How far do you have access
 '' hindustani ne bataaya, ''ahamed patel ji se lekar amar singh ji tak
 Kulkarni then approached other BJP leaders like Advani, Jaitley, Anant Kumar, Shivraj Singh Chauhan and Sushma Swaraj
 or tabhi sting oparation karne kaa vichaar banaaya gaya
 On July 21, Jaitley told Kulkarni that the CNN-IBN channel was ready for the sting operation
 bhaajapa ke teen netaa-ashok argal, mahavir bhagora or faggan singh kulaste-ko chaare ke taur par chunaa gaya
 Their names were already in the list of mps to be sold
 tab hindustani ne sandesh bhijwaaye ki unke paas bikne ke liye teen netaa taiyaar hai
 He says that he then met Aman Arora, a Congress leader at Hotel Claridges, besides Buta Singh's son Lovely
 vegetable soup pite hue hindustani ne unhen bataaya ki unke paas teen ''plot bikaoo hai
 He claims that Lovely took out his cellphone immediately and at 7 pm that day (july 21, 2008)
 30 baje patel ke ghar par ek meeting tay kar lee
 The delighted Hindustani then alerted Kulkarni
 lekin sienen-ibn kii team sting oparation ke liye samay par nahin pahunch saki
 So Hindustani changed the time of the meeting
 unase hotel lee meredian main milane ke liye kaha gaya, jo sansad ke ekadam kareeb he
 Only two BJP mps - Bhagora and Kulaste - attended that meeting
 patel hotel main maujuud nahin the
 Hindustani, who accompanied these mps, states that at the hotel lobby at that time, the son of former Arunachal Pradesh Chief Minister Gegong Apang, Maharashtra Congress leader Kripa Shankar Singh and then Chief Minister of Jharkhand Madhu Koda were visible
 yah shaayad sanyog hi hoga ki ye sabhi netaa us samay maujuud the jab jharkhand mukti morcha ke kuch saansad or purvottar ke ek vipakshi saansad ko congress dwaara phuslane kii baat chal rahi thi
 Hindustani later took up K
 si
 The Dev-led Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC), which investigated the case, said the atmosphere there was as it was on the night of the murder
 lekin sienen-ibn ke tepon main hotel main inamen se kisi bhi netaa kii tasviir nahin thi
 Siddharth Gautam, who worked in this news channel at the time, denies the presence of any of these leaders on that day
 patel ko dabochne ke prayaas main asafal hone ke baad yah dal phir ikattha hua or kulkarni ne hindustani se revati raman singh se sampark saadhane ko kaha
 Hindustani introduced him to this team at Argal's residence at 4, Ferozeshah Road
 revati raman singh jab vahaan pahunche to sting oparation ke liye camere taiyaar the
 They wanted the party to meet Amar Singh that night but the mps were hesitant as they knew that cameras would have to be installed outside Amar Singh's residence
 jepisi ko saunpe gaye sienen-ibn ke tepon main revati raman singh saansadon se kehete hue sune ja rahe hai ki ''maine rakam ke bare main baat nahin kii he
 
 
 We will only talk about the amount in front of you
 
 
 main kaise baat kar saktaa hum
 How do i know what you have ''hindustani hansate hue yaad karte hai, ''ve nahin samaj paae ki ham us raat kyon amar singh ke nivas par nahin janaa chaahate the
 They kept asking why are you afraid of going there
 ve aapako kha nahin jaaenge
 "the fun is that Gautam warned the mps not to go to Amar Singh's residence at night saying that he might be kidnapped if he goes there
" agle din yani vishwaas mat vaale din kii subah hindustani ko revati raman singh kaa phone aayaa, jisamen unhone kaha ki saansadon ko amar singh ke ghar bhej diya jaae
 Only Argal and Kulaste went with Hindustani
 teenon safed jine car main amar singh ke ghar pahunche
 He had no secret camera at that time as Gautam feared that Amar would catch him
 isliye sirf unke nivas ke baahar hi camere lagaae gaye the
 CNN-IBN tapes show Jane going inside the house and coming in, but not seeing the faces of those sitting in it due to the black glass
 aisa isliye ki saansad jab amar singh ke ghar pahunche to unhone na sirf sienen-ibn ke camere dekhe balki duusare samachar channelon ke bhi camere dikhaai die
 He immediately climbed the windows panes
 sienen-ibn ke reporter ne jepisi ko bataaya ki vah hindustani ke alaava gaadi main baithe kisi bhi aadmi ko nahin dekh sakaa
 Hindustani recalls that Amar Singh played very well
 unhone unhen mewa or cold drink pesh kiye
 Hindustani says, "he came in a monarchical way
 '' yaheen par kahani main fark aa jaataa he
 According to Hindustani, Amar immediately picked up the phone and said, "two lotus ones have come
" mere saamne baithe hai
 "hindustani tells that" He put us down and told us that he had spoken to Manmohan Singh
 ''lekin jab india today ne argal se poocha ki amar singh ne kya manmohan singh se baat kii thi to unhone isse manaa kar diya
 He told that Amar Singh called Patel and made him talk to both Kulaste and Argal
 unase jab patel se hone vaali baatcheet ke bare main poocha gaya to argal ne bataaya, ''hum-haa kii baat kii, zyada nahin
 "they admit that the person who spoke on the phone was Patel
" argal kehete hai ki amar singh ne prayek ko 3 karod ru
 Hindustani, however, demanded more
 argal yaad karte hai, ''unhone unase kaha, aap thakur ho
 Why are you speaking like Marwari? "he further says," Amar Singh told us that if you had come last night, the amount could have been more, because by this morning they have 275 mps
 ''chunki yojana camere main paisa dete hue record karne kii thi, isliye saansadon ne amar singh se 1 karod ru
 Asked to send the token amount to Argal's residence and made excuses for the media sitting outside waiting
 india today se baat karte hue amar singh ne is baat se inkaar kiya ki kabhi is tarah kii koi meeting hui
 He says, "you saw the tapes
" isamen reporter mere bare main kahata he ki ve itane chatur hai ki unka sting oparation nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Their misfortune
 '' unhone aage bataaya, ''nyaay kaa kanoon kahata he ki thos saboot ke abhaav main har vyakti andeh kaa laabh milane kaa hakdaar he
 i would also humbly give the benefit of doubt to my harshest critics and political enemies
 ''sanjeev saxena naam kaa ek vyakti argal ke nivas par paisa lekar pahunchaa
 Hindustani says that he had seen Sanjeev Saxena earlier at Amar Singh's residence
 uske saath pili kameez main ek or shaks tha, or donon us paise ko kapade ke thile main lekar aae the
 Argal says that after handing over the money, Saxena made Amar Singh talk to the mps
 paise kaa len-dein camere main kaid kar liya gaya
 10-10 lakhs therein
 kii 10 gaddiyaan thim
 Their serial numbers were recorded
 iske baad saansadon ne un paison ko canvas ke do kaale thilon main daal diya
 Argal says, "since there was a discussion in Parliament that we did not appear for votes that day, the media was looking for us
" hamane do purv saansadon se anurodh kiya ki ve hamaare saath chalem or hamen mili noton ko sansad ke andar pahunchaa den
 Later, during the voting, all three reached the Lok Sabha and put the money in front of everyone, alleging horse-trading
 is par kaaphi hangaamaa hua lekin upie vishwaas mat hasil karne main kaamyaab rahaa
 275 votes cast in favor of UPA, 256 in opposition
 yah bhi ek vidambnaa he ki jis din upie-1 ne vishwaas mat jeeta, usee din upie-2 kii mushkilon kaa bijaropan ho gaya
 Says Kulkarni, "it was decided that CNN-IBN would broadcast the sting operation at the same time when the debate on the confidence vote was going on in Parliament
" lekin channel peeche hat gaya
 Senior BJP leader (ishaar Jaitley's side), who spoke to the channel for the sting operation, said that when the channel did not uphold its point, they felt that they could not make the right choice
 '' amar singh ko bhi sienen-ibn se shikaayat he
 He said, "there are also allegations of money transactions
 saradesai ko apni sthiti saaf kerani chahie
 "CNN-IBN editor-in-chief Rajdeep Sardesai later told the JPC that" we did not play the tape on that day or at the time because we felt we should double-check all the information
 ''is maamle main khandanon kii jhadi lag gai he
 Revathi Raman Singh told the JPC that he was told that Argal wanted to meet Amar Singh, as he wanted to join the SP as the head of the Madhya Pradesh unit due to delimitation of his seat
 unhone kaha, ''maine amar singh se baat kii or kaha ki ye log party main shaamil hona chaahate hai
 He said that his image is not good
 ham unhen party main nahin le sakate
 Saxena has also denied that Amar Singh gave him money to take Argal's residence
 unke mutabik, suhail ke saath ke ek aadmi ne unhen thilaa diya, jo argal ke ghar jane ke raste main ashok road par unki car main aa baitha tha
 Home Minister P
 chidambaram ne haal main ek bahes ke dauraan sansad ko bataaya ki paisa dene main hindustani kii bhoomika ko khaarij nahin kiya ja saktaa
 He said, "his (hindustani) role in arranging money is questionable
 ''saxena ne amar singh ke liye kaam karne kii baat se inkaar kiya or kaha ki ve tatkaaleen sapa saansad shahid siddiki (ab basapa main) ke liye 8 south avenue main kaam karte the, jahaan ''siddiki or amar singh donon kaam kiya karte the
 Amar Singh does not deny that he knew Saxena, but states that he was not a salaried employee
 dev kehete hai, ''media hamase puch chuki he ki jepisi ne amar singh yaa ahamed patel ko poochtacha ke liye kyon nahin bulaayaa
 But there is no prima facie evidence against him
 sirf isliye ki kuch baatcheet main unka naam liya gaya he
 
 
 There should be some evidence against them
 tepe main aisa kuch bhi nahin he
 Neither have their faces nor their voices

 The initial days of love are very happy
 ek saath vakt kaise nikal jaataa he, pataa hi nahin chalata
 But during this time if you are finding some small things strange, do not Ignore them
 kyonki jo chijen hamen shuruaati daur main choti or gaiyr mahatvapurn lagati he, vah darasal, aage chalakar badi problem ban kar khadi ho jaati hai
 If you see these five things at the beginning of a relationship, then it is better that you stop it there
 na milaae doston serilationships main aate hi aapane apane bwoyfriend ko apni khaas saheliyon or apni ruumamets se to mila diya
 But when it comes to meeting his friends, he always retracts or makes some excuse
 khaastaur se uske doston ke saath kahin ghoomane kii baat ho to vah kabhi taiyaar nahin hota
 His attitude proves that he is not going to be in a relationship with you for many days
 ho saktaa he ki uske dost aapke bare main jaanate bhi na hon
 Whatever it is, the sooner you clear this thing, the better it will be
 jab partner kare ignor to kuch aisa aajamaayenmobile chipkuzyaadaatar ladke tech friendli or tech lovers hote hai
 But if your boyfriend is not able to stay away from his mobile even on Date and continuously text or chat on it, then this is an alarming sign for you
 vah ye jaahir karne kii koshish kar rahaa he ki aapke samay kii koi keemat nahin he
 There may be someone else in his life
 yah samajhane vaali baat he ki uski life main doosraa aisa koun ho saktaa he, jise turant riplai karne kii use jarurat pade
 Don't Respect Some boys are very happy to tell that how many girls have broken their hearts or dated with others
 aapkaa bwoyfriend bhi agar aisa hi karata he to jaraa sanbhal jaaen
 Because such people do not respect girls, and maybe the next name of yours can also be included in this story
 aise log lambaa saath nahin nibhaate
 Whether or not they say, but these 10 things go on in the minds of most girls, it is difficult to take decisions under many circumstances
 par aapkaa bwoyfriend chote-mote faislon ke liye bhi apni maa, apane doston yaa aap par nirbhar ho to yah acha sin nahin he
 Such people can also leave you on the advice of others
 aise logon main macurity kii kami hoti he

 But who does not like his praise, boy or girl
 mushkil tab hoti he, jab aap kisi ke saath long relationships main rahanaa chaahati hai or vah baar-baar sirf aapaki kamiyaan bataata he
 There are good and bad aspects of anyone's personality, if your boyfriend is seeing only evil in you, then understand that this relationship is not going to last long

 ) real estate ke sahare ensiaar main agar kisi shahar ko sabase zyada tarakkee mili he, to wo he gudgaanv
 People bought houses to live here, but now the people of Gurgaon have become millionaires due to those houses
 shahar kii planning real estate kii raftaar se taal nahin mila pai or logon kaa ghar karodon ke makaan main tabdeel hokar rah gaya he
 After all, the jaggery of money is more sweet or the mess of daily traffic is more bitter
 do tasveeron main dikhaai detaa ek shahar
 The entry of the city is visible from the difference of two doors
 nae hisse main pravesh karte logon kaa swaagat shandaar sadak karti he to puraane hisse main entry kooday ke dher ke bich se hoti he
 India resides in one part of the city, India resides in the other
 ek taraf maujuud hai gaganchumbi imaaraten or corporate offis
 It is present here, on the other hand is the office and residence of every big officer of the city
 jila aspataal he, nagar nigam kaa daftar he, lekin vyavastha badahaal he
 The metro has reached much earlier in the new Gurgaon
 aage bhi iske vistaar kii yojanaayen hai
 Preparations are underway to make mono rail
 puraane gudgaanv main logon ke hisse aayaa he to bas stand
 The people of New Gurgaon go to the mall for shopping and the residents of old Gurgaon move to the local markets for shopping
 nae gudgaanv or puraane gudgaanv ke logon kii samasyaayein bhi alag alag hai
 Gurgaon is given the status of Millennium City, as the city is close to the airport
 yahaan par real estate ne joardaar tarakkee kii he
 There are luxurious offices of reputed companies in India and abroad
 isi vajah se logon ne yahaan par ghar kharide
 Whether the residents of those houses get relieved or not, but houses purchased in lakhs have reached crores
 real estate kii tarakkee ne logon kaa ghar nivesh kaa vikalp banaakar rakh diya he
 If they were really home, then talking to the people here would not open the millennium city facilities
 logon ke mutabik ye milinium city nahin he, ye to million problem city he
 The biggest problem of the city is traffic
 chaahe nae gudgaanv ke nivasee hon yaa puraane gudgaanv ke log, trephic ke badtar halaat se sab pareshaan hai
 After all, who is responsible for this bad condition of the city? Why do these flyovers on NH 8 suffer such terrible jams everyday in just 5 years
 fliover ke neeche lalabatti par lanbaa intazaar he to express ve hone kaa ghamand fliover par lagane vaala jam todakar rakh detaa he
 Actually, Kasur is planning
 haryana ke mukhya sachiv industryil planning yashavir malik ke mutabik jab tak planning kaa vijan 100 saal kaa nahin hoga shahar ko samasyaon se chhutkaaraa nahin mil paaegaa
 Builders, who build and sell crores of houses in Gurgaon, agree to 100 years of planning, but at the same time they say that there are changes in planning according to the requirements and that is why the scope of the master plan will be 10 to 20 years
 is
 planning ko lekar sarkaar ke paas bhi soch he
 Planning should be implemented from the city to the homes
 is vijan ke baavjood gudgaanv kii ye haalat dekhakar taras hi aa saktaa he
 Residents of the city also question the planning of Millennium City
 baat jahaan se shuru kii gai thi phir vahiin aa jaati he ki aakhir kyon yahaan kii sadakon par jam laga rahata he? kyon ye shahar ke logon kaa sabase bada dard ban gaya he? shahar main kol centre or tamaam tarah kii iti companiyon kii cabs jam kii ek badi vajah hai
 In the case of illegal earning, they seat the passengers
 savaariyon ke liye ye sadak par jahaan-tahaan gaadi roak lete hai or phir peeche tak jam lage to inaki bhalaa se
 People also see this as the best option for comfortable travel and saving time for a low fare
 agar shahar main public transport kii haalat sudhar jaae to in cabs se log bhi duuri banaaenge
 There is also a complaint from the people of Gurgaon that the public transport here is in very poor condition
 khastahal public transport main logon kaa sahaara ye shering auto hai lekin inke khadey hone se lekar chalane tak kaa tarika aisa he ki sadakon par ye jam lagane kii ek bahut badi vajah hai
 The ramshackle roads here and the daily experiments in them are also a big reason for the jam

 shaadi jivan kaa sabase mahatpurna nirnay hota he
 In order to have a happy life with your partner, it is very important to keep some things in mind before getting married
 isliye shaadi karne se pehle khud se ye sawaal jarur kar len ki aap shaadi kii jimmedaariyaan uthaane ke liye kitne taiyaar hai? ham aapako aisi hi kuch baaten bataa rahe hai jinaki madad se aap ye jaan sakenge kii shaadi ke liye aap kitne taiyaar hai
 Let us know when you should get married
 
 
 -jivan menkariyar or aarthik rup se safaltaprapt karne par aap shaadi karne kaa nirnay le sakate hai
 While marrying, do not think about how much your partner earns, but focus on how much you are capable of fulfilling your financial needs in life
 taaki samay padane par aap apni family kaa sahaara ban saken
 If a feeling of love is growing in your heart towards a friend or person and you believe that this is the person with whom you can spend your life
 saath hi aap donon ek duusare ko acchhee tarah se samajhate hai or aapako apni pasand par puraa vishwaas he to aap shaadi karne kaa nirnay le sakate hai
 - Good or bad, every person has a past in life and it is better to forget the past as past
 jab aapako khud par yakeen ho jaae ki aap apane ateet ke rishton ko puri tarah se peeche chhod kar jivan main aage bad chuke hai or jise aap pyaar karte hai use dil se apana chuke hai to aap shaadi karne kaa nirnay le sakate hai
 But before marriage, share the important things related to your life with your partner
 isse aap donon ke bichpyar or vishwasabdhegaa
 -when you love someone, you are unable to see the flaws of your partner even if you want to
 isliye shaadi se pehle apane partner ke bare main apane parivaar or doston se salaah jarur kar len
 Because family and close people are your support system and they will choose your life partner only after seeing your good
 -jab aapako is baat kaa ehsaas ho jaae ki aap shaadi ke liye bilkul taiyaar hai or aapane apane jeevanasathi ke rup main ek sahi vyakti kaa chayan kiya he to aap bina kuch soche samajhen shaadi kar sakate hai
 -if you are sure that you can face all kinds of situations in life
 aap maior hai, chizon ko sahi dhang se samajhate hai
 So you can get married
 lekin shaadi karne se pehle is baat kaa dhyaan jarur rakhen ki shaadi ke baad aapkaa faisla sirf aapkaa nahin hoga balki iskaa asar do pariwaron par padegaa
 You may have to adjust yourself according to the situation in many ways
 agar aap khud ko in sab karne ke sakasham samajhate ho to aap shaadi ke liye taiyaar hai
