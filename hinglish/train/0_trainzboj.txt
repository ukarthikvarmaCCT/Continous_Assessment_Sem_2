 After getting a job and big salary in a big company for five years, Vinod Kumar wondered what is the meaning of such a life in which you can neither sleep peacefully nor eat food at home
 dedline or target ke bich vah apni jindagi main kaaphi ghutan mahasoos kar rahe the
 And then after much deliberation, he decided to take a break from his job
 lagbhag saal bhar vah bharat ke vibhinn hisson main ghoomte rahe, jo unke liye kaaphi acha sabit hua
 He felt that now is the time to join his roots and he decided to join agriculture
 vinod kaa kahana he ki jab vah desh ke gramin ilaakon main gum rahe the, tab unhone paaya ki desh ke kisaan fertilizer kaa kharchaa nahin uthaa paane ke kaaran utani hi subjiyan yaa anaaj uga pate hai, jitne main unka parivaar kha sake
 Vinod left the job after wandering and returned to his district Kanchipuram
 ek saal tak kaaphi sangharsh karne ke baad philhal unke paas abhi chah acre jameen he, jisamen vah makka, jau or kai subjiyan bina kisi rasinic khaad kaa prayog kiye hue ugaate hai

 ise sochate hue hi unhone apane ek dost ke saath srilanka, laos, cambodia, vietnam, myanmar, bangladesh or bhutan jane kaa faisla kiya
 They believe that traditional cultivation is still practiced in these countries, which will benefit them

 Describing Rohingya refugees as a threat to the internal security of the country, the Indian government has spoken of sending illegal Rohingyas back to Myanmar, but the biggest challenge before the government is that how can these people be sent back? The government is currently finding a way to deal with this problem
 sarkaar kii report ke anusaar, bharat main 40 hajaar rohingya avaidh rup se rah rahe hai
 These Rohingyas are living in Delhi and NCR including Jammu, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan
 in logon par aatankwaadiyon se conection kaa aarope lagata rahaa he
 For this reason, other countries also do not seem to agree to give them shelter
 myanmar main hinsa failane ke baad rohingya bharat, thailand, bangladesh, pakistan, nepal samet kai deshon main avaidh rup se bas to gaye, lekin thailand ko chhod koi bhi desh inhen ab tak waapas nahin bhej sakaa he
 Indeed, Thailand figured out a different route to repatriate the Rohingyas
 kya kiya tha thailand ne
 
 
 In 2014 Thailand issued a decree to repatriate Rohingyas
 jiske baad se ab tak 1300 rohingyaon ko waapas bheja ja chukaa he
 The Thai authorities decided to send the Rohingyas back voluntarily
 saral bhashaa main kahen to thailand ne rohingyaon ko yah chhot di thi ki wo waapas kaise jaaen yah unki marji par nirbhar karata he
 Lt Gen Farnu Kardalarfon, who was then handling the deportation of the Rohingyas in Thailand, told the AP, "we sent the Rohingyas in groups of 100 to 200 as per their wish
 unka maananaa tha ki rohingya thailand main apana bhavishya nahin dekhte hai
 That's why we sent them back
 " haalanki, is tarah rohingyaon ko waapas bhejne par maanav adhikaar sanghathanon ne thailand kii kadi aalochana kii thi
 Why Rohingya are fleeing from their own country 
 
 maaloom ho ki myanmar main rohingya kii aabaadi 10 lakh ke kareeb he
 The Rohingya community settled in the Rakhine area of myanmar in the early 15th century, but the local Buddhist majority community has not adopted them till date
 yahi vajah rahi he ki myanmar main sainya shashan aane ke baad rohingya samudaay ke saamaajik bahishkaar ko baqayada raajnneetik faisle kaa rup de diya gaya or unase naagarikta chin lee gai
 Following the killing of some security personnel in Rakhine in 2012, widespread riots broke out between the Rohingya and the Buddhists
 tab se myanmar main rohingya samudaay ke khilaaf hinsa jari he
 This is the reason why the Rohingya are taking refuge in other countries
 ab aage dekhnaa hoga ki bharat rohingyaon ko waapas bhejne ke liye thailand kaa rasta apanaataa he yaa nahin

 sab jaanate hai ki nideshak chahen ranjit sinha hon yaa anil sinha, fark sirf naam kaa ho saktaa he, ipies jwine karne ke saal main antar ho saktaa he, lekin donon apane kariyar main raajnneetik aakaaon ke khilaaf jane kii himmat kabhi nahin juta paae
 So if you are thinking that there will be a radical change in the cbi's investigation and functioning, then you are going to be disappointed
 lekin sawaal he ki narendra modi ne anil sinha ko hi is pad ke liye kyon behatar samajha
 In fact, the Modi government is compelled that whether it is Anil Ambani or Kumar Mangalam Birla or Gautam Adani or his most trusted confidant Amit Shah, the future of everyone will be decided on the direction of CBI investigation
 or anil sinha vahi karenge jo modi sarkaar chaahegi, matlab vah aisa kuch nahin karenge jisase sarkaar or khaskar narendra modi ko koi pareshaani ho
 However, it is also certain that he will not repeat Ranjit Sinha's mistake
 anil sinha kii yah visheshta he ki vah kisi ko naaraaz rakhane main vishwaas nahin karte or bos ko khush karne ke liye kisi bhi had tak ja sakate hai
 Experts believe that perhaps Prime Minister Narendra Modi is following the principle that "well-known evil is better than the unknowing Devil"

 narendra modi aaj ek baar phir bhavuk ho gayi or unhone rundhe gale se kaha ki yahaan se unke jane ke baad bhi gujarat aage badhegaa or agar unhone kuch galat kiya he to unhen maaf kar diya jaae
 Addressing the members of the Gujarat Legislative Assembly, Modi said, 'forgive me if i have done anything wrong
 mukhyamantri ke taur par yah meraa chauthaa kaarykaal he
 Now i am going and do not know when i will come back here, so i want you to forgive me if you feel that i was not right in my work and there was a flaw in my conduct
 'gujarat vidhansabha ke sadasyon ne modi ko bhaavbheene vidaai di or bhavi pradhanmantri ne rundhe gale se kaha, 'aaj maafee kaa din he
 i respect all of you and this House

 modi kaa mangalawar ko ek alag swaroop saamne aayaa tha jab vah dilli main bijepi sansadeey dal ke netaa chune jane ke baad apane sambodhan main bhavuk ho gaye the or unki ankhen nam ho gayi thim
 In an emotional tone, Modi today said, 'my success lies in how you take this journey of development forward
 or mujhe vishwaas he ki gujarat mere jane ke baad aage badhegaa
 Always keep the focus of Gujarat assured the Assembly that after becoming Prime Minister, he will always pay attention to Gujarat
 unhone kaha, 'swaabhaavik he ki mujh par pehla adhikaar gujaratiyon kaa he
 But with this new responsibility i have to ensure that injustice is not done to other people
 main sunishchit karanga ki gujarat ko bhi uskaa adhikaar mili
 The newly appointed Prime Minister emphasized on strengthening the institutions to continue the good work
 63 saal ke modi ne kaha, 'vyakti aadhaarit ravaiya zyada din nahin chalata
 We have to institutionalize ideas where people come and go, but good works continue
 agar kuch log gujarat ke pichley 12 saal kaa adhyayan karenge to ve paaenge ki sansthaaon ke nirmaan par jor diya gaya
 According to Modi, when he came to Gujarat to become the Chief Minister, the situation was grim after the earthquake, the storm and after the scams in cooperative banks like Madhavpura Cooperative Bank
 unhone apni uplabdhiyaan ginaayin or kaha ki inase hi gujarat kaa cheharaa badalane main madad mili
 He said, 'I personally believe that the CAG reports should not be used for political gains but to find solutions
 maine yahaan aisi vyavastha banaai or apane logon se samasyaon kii jadon main jane ko kaha
 Modi said, 'I have always believed that in a democracy a legislator also matters then he represents any party
 vidhayak kii aawaaj matlab janata kii aawaaj
 Not only the BJP mlas but all those present here have worked hard to solve the problems of this state

 Modi pointed to his heart, saying, there is no need to open a separate counter in Delhi
 maine yahaan pehle hi sthai counter khol diya he
 Pollution levels in Delhi have increased rapidly once again
 aasmaan main har taraf dhul bhari chadar dekhne ko mil rahi he
 Due to breathing in this dusty polluted air, people's health is being affected
 pradooshan se hoti hai sehat ko ye pareshaaniyaan:pradooshit hawa main saans lene se khaansee, zukam, aakhon main jalan, fefde main infections, saasm kii beemaari, twachaa sambadhi pareshaaniyaan, hriday rog, baalo kaa jhadanaa aadi samasyaayein ho sakati hai
 Asthma patients are also more likely to have an attack
 khatarnaak ho gai he dilli kii hawa, khaane main shaamil karen ye chijempradooshit hawa se aise karen bachaav:1
 If the AQI index is more than 150, avoid exercise, cricket, hockey, cycling, marathon with more physical activity
 pradooshan str ke 200 se zyada hone par park main bhi daudane or tahalne naa jaaen
 Do not walk long distances when the pollution level is more than 300
 jab str 400 ke paar ho to ghar ke andar rahen, saamaanya walk bhi naa karen
 Stay indoors
 pradooshan str 1000 par hone par public health immergency jaise halaat hote hai
 At this stage do not get out of the house at all, stay at home
 2
 Before going out of the house, apply a mask on your face
 3
 Plant more and more trees in your home and nearby areas
 ye hawa ko purifai karne kaa kaam karte hai
 With which you will be able to breathe fresh air
 4
 Water is very important to get the poison out of the breath
 isliye pani pinaa nahin bhoolen
 Drink up to 4 liters of water a day
 ghar se baahar nikalate vakt bhi pani pien
 Due to this, the supply of oxygen in the body will remain correct and even if the toxic gases present in the atmosphere reach the blood, it will cause less harm
 5
 Use vitamin-c, omega-3 as much as possible in food
 shahad, lahasun, adarak kaa khaane main zyada se zyada istemaal karen
 In the condition of cough, cold, consume honey and ginger juice
 dil kii dushman he jarurat se zyada neend, aa saktaa he heart atake6
 If coming out of the house is your compulsion then after coming home, clean the mouth, eyes and nose with lukewarm water
 baahar se aane ke baad bhaap bhi le sakate hai
 7
 jab tak pradooshan he tab tak bacchon ko baahar khilne naa nikalne den
 Avoid cycling, do not walk too long
 8
 If there is a problem of phlegm, take black pepper mixed with honey
 vahiin, lahasun main antiboytic tatv hote hai jo pradooshan se ladane kii kshamta badhaate hai
 9
 asthma ke marij hai to davaaiyaan hameshaa saath rakhen
 Pregnant women wear masks even during their stay at home
 10 
 Pollution levels are high in the morning, so do not go on the morning walk
 dhoop nikalne ke baad hi baahar hi nikalen
 Do not get out of your motorcycle or bicycle
 raktadan he mahadaan yah sabhi jaanate hai lekin ham main se kitne aise hai jo niyamit raktadan karte hai
 The World Health Organization runs awareness campaigns on blood donation and this is why World Blood Donor Day (world Blood Donation Day) is celebrated on 14 June in countries around the world
 is din jaagarukta abhiyaan chalaaya jaataa he or janamanas ko muft raktadan karne ke liye prerit kiya jaataa he
 This year, the theme of Blood Donation Day is 'every blood donor is a hero', which focuses on how every blood donor becomes a hero by giving blood
 yah theme un logon ko samarpit he jo khamoshi se raktadan kar pratidin kai logon kii jaan bachaate hai or saath hi duniyabar ke logon ko raktadan ke liye prerit bhi karata he
 Blood donation can save the lives of many needy people, while at the same time it is also beneficial for human body
 kuch log ke man main raktadan ke prati galat jaankaree ne ghar kar liya he
 They believe that this makes our body weak, but let us know that it does not cause any ill effects in the body, but the blood coming out of the human body becomes back in a few days
 rakt kaa plasm to 2 se 3 din main waapas ban jaataa he
 It takes about 20 to 59 days for red blood cells to form and depends on how often the person keeps donating blood
 raktadan kitna jaruri he aap isse hi andaja laga sakate hai ki durghatana main achaanak atyadhik raktasrav yaa anya bimariyon jaise- khun kaa nirmaan kam yaa naa ke baraabar hona, jaisi sthitiyon main rogi ko khun baahar se diya jaataa he
 This blood is offered from one person to the other after ABO and RH blood group matching
 kaha bhi gaya he ki raktadan-mahadaan he, kyonki daan kiya gaya rakt kisi kii jaan bachaata he
 So you too should donate blood and give help in saving people's lives

 agar aap bhi kisi kishori kii maa hai to ab aapako pehle se adhik sajag rahane kii jarurat he
 Friendship with boys, attraction towards them, Snapchat, vlog, cool clothes and many other things will now become your daughter's habit
 ab tak wo duniya ko aapaki najaron se dekhati rahi hogi lekin ab uski apni soch viksit hona shuru ho gai hogi
 In such a situation, you need to be especially vigilant, but it does not at all mean that you should start banning him

 In such a situation, it is not right to interrupt him every time

 When she understands the changes within and around herself, she will be able to take a better decision
 apane vichaaron or soch ko us par thopanaa bilkul bhi sahi nahin hoga
 2

 It can be dangerous for you to compare your daughter with the children of the neighborhood or with the children of relatives

 In such a situation, it would not be right to follow him around like a detective or inquire on everything
 use uskaa spes den
 By doing this, the trust between you two will increase

 rafel vimaan saude ko lekar congress ne centre kii modi sarkaar ke khilaaf morcha khol diya he
 After Congress President Rahul Gandhi took an attacking stance on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, senior party leaders are outspoken and are making a ruckus on the Bharatiya Janata Party with the help of Rafael
 pehle rahul gandhi ne rafel deal ko modi kii 'personal deal' bataaya tha
 Now senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad has accused the Modi government of playing with the country's security over the Rafale deal
 unhone kaha ki congress ne 126 rafel vimaan ke saude kii baat kii thi, lekin modi sarkaar ne sankhya ghataakar 36 kar di
 Azad said, "tenders were offered for 126 Rafale jets in the UPA government, but the deal was canceled
 ab ham kya kharid rahe hai? keval 36
 In such a situation, who is going to compensate for 90 Rafale jets? So why not understand that the current government has compromised with national security? ”the accusation round about the Rafale deal is in the news when French President Emmanuel Macron is on a four-day visit to India from Friday
 Huh
 bataa den ki maikron kii yah pehali bharat yatra he
 On coming to India, he spoke to India Today and praised PM Modi
 unhone kaha ki rafel deal mere kaarykaal main nahin hui thi, lekin main ye kahana chaahunga ki ye deal ham donon ke liye hi phydemand rahi he
 He said that many parts of Rafale will now be made in India
 aise main ye yahaan kii industry or yahaan ke kamgaaron ke liye behatar he
 As far as security is concerned, it is highly advanced in its category
 maujuuda vakt main iskaa koi muqabla nahin he
 From the point of view of France, this deal is special for us because there are plenty of possibilities in India
 yah hamaare saajha samjhauton kaa ek hissaa he
 How much better to tell President Emmanuel Macronafelsaude, but the opposition in the country and especially the Congress wants to surround the Modi government on this issue
 yahi kaaran he ki haal ke dinon main congress party adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne rafel deal ko modi kii 'personal deal' bataaya tha
 The Congress had issued a letter saying that Modi ji went to Paris personally, signed the Rafale deal himself and changed the personal deal
 yahi nahin, congress ne piem modi se rafel par 10 sawaalon kii suchi jari kar kaha tha ki congress desh bhar main janata ke bich jaakar rafel deal kaa prachaar prasar karenge
 
 
 1
 kya aisa gopneey he raksha mantri ji ki rafel saude ko chupaaya ja rahaa he ?2
 Is Parliament a threat to the security of the country? What permission was taken from CCS for this deal? 3
 aarope he ki ek plane kii keemat 1555 karod rupee hai, jabaki congress 428 karod main rupee main kharid rahi thi ?4
 The cost of America's most modern war aircraft is not even 1500 crores, so why were these aircraft bought so expensive? 5
 is saude main technology transfar kyon nahin ho rahaa he?6
 Comedy, questioning the defense deal is treason
 aap to aaj bhi boforce par aarope lagaate hai or prashn karte hai?7
 Why did the army hold a press conference on the Rafale deal? Is the Army CAG? 8
 videsh se pradhanmantri ne kyon is raksha saude kii ghoshnaa kii? ajtak aaazaad bharat ke kisi PM ne ye kaam nahi kiya
 9
 is saude se sarkari HAL ko hataa kar ambani ko kyon daalaa ja rahaa he? 25000 karod rupee kaa ghaataa he HAL ko ?10
 Why not hand over the investigation to the Joint Parliamentary Committee ie JPC

 However, he did not name anyone during this time

 sapa basapa gathbandhan swaarthhit main liya gaya faisla he jiskaa nateeja chunavi parinaam main dekhne ko mil jaayegaa
 He said that those who have arrogance over the SP-BSP alliance will be shattered soon
 bhartiya janata party par nishaanaa sadhate hue yadav ne kaha ki in logon ko janata nakaar chuki he, bhaajapa sarkaar va modi kaa ikbaal mar chukaa he

 However, the leaders talk about not being aware of it
 ‘uttar pradesh mantri vetan, bhatte evam vividh kanoon 1981' tab bana tha jab vishwanath pratap singh rajya ke mukhyamantri the
 The law has so far benefited 19 chief ministers and about 1,000 ministers

 Ever since the law came into force, Yogi Adityanath, Mulayam Singh Yadav, Mayawati, Kalyan Singh, Akhilesh Yadav, Ramprakash Gupta, Rajnath Singh, Shripati Mishra, Veer Bahadur Singh and Narayan Dutt Tiwari benefited from various political parties
 vishwanath pratap singh ke sahyogi rahe congress ke ek netaa ne bataaya ki kanoon paarit hote samay tatkaaleen mukhyamantri vishwanath pratap singh ne vidhansabha main tark diya tha ki rajya sarkaar ko iskar kaa boj jhelana chahie kyonki adhiktar mantri garib prishthbhumi se hai or unki aay kam he

 Many leaders, including former finance minister and BSP leader Lalji Verma, are not aware of this law
 unka kahana he ki jahaan tak unhen yaad he, vah kar adaayagi karte rahe hai
 An SP leader said that he was not aware of any such facility
 varisht sapa netaaon se baat karne ke baad hi vah is bare main kuch kah paaenge
 State Law Minister Brijesh Pathak said that only after confirming this to the officials, he would be in a position to talk on this issue
 samajasevi anil kumaar ne kaha ki aam aadmi ke liye yah hairaangi kii baat he jo baari bharkam raashi kar ke rup main detaa he, lekin netaa kar adaayagi nahin karte
 He said that leaders like us should also pay income tax

 karnataka sarkaar kaveri jal vivaad ko lekar supreme court kaa aadesh maanane ko taiyaar nahin he
 The Supreme Court ordered Karnataka to release 6,000 cusecs of water daily for Tamil Nadu from 21 to 27 September
 lekin karnataka sarkaar is maamle main phir supreme court pahunch gai he or sarvocch adaalat se is faisle main sanshodhan karne kaa aagrah kiya he
 On behalf of the Karnataka government, on Monday, the Supreme Court was told that there is not enough water in its reservoirs so it is unable to release water as per the court order
 siem siddharamaiya bole- SC ke aadesh kaa paalan nahin kar paaengetin din pehle karnataka vidhansabha ke vishesh satr main ek prastaav bhi paarit kiya gaya tha, jisamen kaha gaya he ki pani kaa upyog sirf peyajal kii jaruraton ke liye hoga or ise kisi duusare makasad ke liye nahin diya jayega
 In the House, Chief Minister Siddaramaiah had said in his reply, 'this impossible situation has arisen where it is not possible to follow the court order
 ’SC ne kaveri water management board banane kaa aadesh diyaek hafte pehle supreme court ne karnataka ko 27 sitambar tak rojaanaa 6 hajaar kusek pani chhodane kaa aadesh diya tha
 The Cauvery Inspection Committee had earlier issued an order to release 3,000 cusecs of water, which was doubled by the Supreme Court
 nyaayamurti deepak mishra or nyaayamurti udai umesh lalit kii peeth ne centre sarkaar ko chaar hafte ke andar kaveri prabandhan board kaa gathan karne or iske gathit ho jane kii adhisuchana ke saath adaalat ko rapat dene kaa nirdesh diya tha
 Just a spark is late and there will be war in America and North Korea
 daraana hamaara makasad katai nahin he
 But now the situation has become such because till now, the cynical dictator of North Korea was threatening it, but now for the first time in very open words, US President Donald Trump has said that Kim Jong has become cancerous to the world
 Treatment is necessary
 ab chunki trump bhi jaanate hai ki wo kya kah rahe hai
 Therefore, he has also made it clear that this struggle will be very fierce
 uttar korea ko nahin bakshegaa americakuch inhen lafzon main jang ko taalane or kim jong un par dabaav banane kii lakhon koshish kar ke haarane ke baad america raashtrapati donald trump ne puri duniya ko maujuuda halaat se rubaru karaayaa he
 It is important to understand the ways in which Trump's words are
 kyonki jab duniya kaa sabase shaktishaalee desh ye jubaan bolne lage
 So suppose that the situation is not really under control now
 to sabase pehle jaaniye trump kii wo dhamkee jisase saafe he ki ab wo uttar korea kii kisi bhi harakat ko bakshne ke mood main bilkul bhi nahin hai
 War could be postponed if Kim wants US President Donald Trump to say that a fierce war with North Korea can happen anytime
 or yahi ek mauka he ki ham ek badi tabaahi ko khatm kar saken
 Yes, but if Kim Jong-un is willing to stop his nuclear programs, then we can avoid war
 uttar korea kii kaman sanbhaalane ke baad is umr main kim jo chaahate hai, wo aasaan nahin he
 The world is threatening the dictator since Donald Trump became president
 america tab se hi uttar korea se sakhti se pesh aa rahaa he
 To counter Kim Jong Un's policies recently, US Vice President Mike Pence said that the dam of patience was now broken
 or ab khud america raashtrapati donald trump ne saaf lafzon main uttar korea kowarningde di he
 The US has diplomatically tried to surround it to stop North Korea
 magar kim jong un ke gurur ko ek inch bhi kam nahin kar paaya
 On the contrary, his anger has increased so much that now he is threatening the world by taunting
 parmaanu bam kii dhamkeegar hamen uksaaya gaya to ham na sirf dushmano par parmaanu hamalaa karenge
 We will also conduct nuclear tests every week
 or hamen koi roak nahin saktaa he
 All activities of the enemy are being monitored and we are also ready to respond to any kind of aggression
 north korea ko koi chhu bhi nahin saktaa, or agar aisa hota he to hamaare log na sirf banduukon or mixilon se apni raksha karenge
 Rather we have atomic bombs, only three bombs will destroy the world
 america ko karaare jawaab kii dhamkito kya vaaki jang tay he
 i would ignore this frightening truth even for a moment
 magar use nazarandaaz kaise karen, jo paanch-paanch parmaanu bam liye baitha he or kaabo main aane ko taiyaar nahin
 Before anything comes out of Trump's mouth, he is ready to speak that every action of America will be answered
 karaara jawaab milegaa
 But what Kim Jong Un wants to do
 insaaniyat use bardaasht kar nahin paaegi
 The deployment of Thad in South Korea, but it is also a reality that taking the eyes closed does not change the truth
 or sachai to ye he ki america ek taraf jahaan korian peninsula main apane jangi jahaazon ko tainaat kar chukaa he, to vahiin duusari taraf usne dakshin korea main terminal hai altude aria dephence jise duniya thad ke naam se jaanati he
 His deployment has also started
 uttar korea se maujuuda jang ke halaat main tainaat kii gai thad ko aasaan bhashaa main samajhen to ise mixilon ko nishkreey karne ke liye istemaal kiya jaataa he
 Preparing for war on both sides, both countries are burning the kind of fire in their statements
 usase andaaza lagaaiye ki agar ye sangharsh vaaki main hua to ye kitna bheeshan hoga
 Because when the US takes one step forward, then the dictator of war goes 10 steps further
 anti belistic missile system, newclear pandubbi, jahaji bedaa karl vinson or thad tainaat kar ke america ne agar north korea kii sainya gheraabandi kii
 So North Korea, in its biggest military drill, bombed 300 big tanks and attacked the fake warship with Submarine and blasted it and gave the message to the US that it has the answer to every attack

 Bollywood actress Aishwarya Rai Bachchan is facing stiff opposition over an advertisement for her recent jewelery
 is vigyaapan main ek baccha unke peeche ek chaataa liye khadaa he jiskaa kai saamaajik kaaryakarta virodh kar rahe hai
 However, Aishwarya says that the company has changed the photo in the advertisement
 is vigyaapan kaa virodh karne waalon main rashtriya bal adhikaar sangrakshan ayog kii purv adhyaksha bhi shaamil hai, jinhone aishwarya ko is bare main khulaa khat bhi likhaa he
 These people feel that this advertisement is going to promote child labor
 patr main likhaa he, ‘ham is vigyaapan kii avadharana par niraashaa vyakt karte hai, or aapane bhi shaayad bina soche kisi utpaada ko bechney ke liye bacchon ko is tarah dikhaaya jane vaale vigyaapan se judana thik samajha
 Aishwarya said in her statement to the authors of the letter that thank you for drawing attention to this, but the last printed ad has been replaced with a photo
 aishwarya ne iske saath hi shooting kii ek original photo bhi bheji he
 Nitish also talked about demonetisation saying that he had supported it, but no one was telling how much black money came
 iske alaava benami sampatti jabt karne kii unhone maang kii thi, lekin centre is par maun saadhe hue he or jab tak benami sampatti jabt karne kii prakriya shuru nahin hoti kaale dhan ke khilaaf abhiyaan adhuraa rahegaa
 When asked about the Uttar Pradesh election result, Nitish said that if there was a grand alliance there, perhaps the result would have been something else
 chunaav parinaam par nitish ne kaha ki saafe he ki samaajawaadee party, bahujan samaaj party or congress kaa vot pratishat bijepi or uske sahyogiyon se das pratishat zyada he
 Better results come where the opposition is united
 vikalp ke rup ke rup main koi party ubhartee he to use safalataa milti he
 Had there been a broad opposition unity, the result would have been different, but if Nitish believes, anti-bjp parties should now raise issues of public interest and national interest
 apana agenda set karnaa chahie, jaise mahagathbandhan bihar main safal hua he, desh main mahasafal hoga
 There have been talks with the left parties
 uttar pradesh ke chunaav parinaam ke bare main puche jane par nitish ne kaha ki agar vahaan mahagathbandhan hota to shaayad parinaam kuch or hota
 On the election result, Nitish said that the vote percentage of Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party and Congress is ten percent more than BJP and its allies
 jahaan vipakshi ekta hogi vahaan behatar parinaam aate hai
 If a party emerges as an alternative, it succeeds
 ek vyapak vipakshi ekta hoti to parinaam alag aata, lekin nitish kii maane to bijepi virdohi dalon ko ab janhit or rashtrahit ke mudde uthaane chahie
 Should set its agenda, as the Grand Alliance has succeeded in Bihar, there will be a Mahasafla in the country

 Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray on Friday expressed concern over the recent decision of the Delhi High Court to give Muslim girls the right to nikah when they are Sayani (15 years old), saying it would give a boost to 'girl child' among Muslims

 Having sexual relations with a girl before 18 years of age is 'rape', even if it is with her consent
 yah kanoon sabhi bharatiyon par lagu hota he or isamen jati yaa dharm ke aadhaar par koi bhedbhaav nahin he
 Thackeray wrote, 'what will happen in that situation when a Muslim girl who becomes Sayani but under 18 years of age? When the law is equally applicable to all Indians, how can it be different when a Muslim girl becomes a woman? The Constitution and the law do not take decisions keeping in mind the caste or religion of the people

 After England's victory in the match between India and England at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai, Flintoff took off his shirt and waved it

 Bharatiya Janata Party Vice President Sadhvi Uma Bharti came to Bapu's defense on Thursday over a charge leveled against Sant Asaram Bapu by a minor girl
 uma bharti ne guuruuvaar ko charchaa karte hue kaha ki haalanki unki puri sahanubhuti ladki ke saath he, lekin doosraa paksh yah bhi he ki jis prakaar shankaracharya jayendra saraswati ke khilaaf ek mahila ne hatya ke aarope lagaae the or baad main vah nyaayalay se bari ho gaye the tathaa duusare paksh ne unke khilaaf galat shikaayat karne kii baat bhi sweekaar kii thi, thik usee prakaar is maamle main bhi ho rahaa he
 He said that Asaram used to speak openly against Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi and UPA chief Sonia Gandhi and there are Congress governments in both Delhi and Rajasthan and whether such a girl has become a victim of political conspiracy
 uma bharti ne aaj asaram baapu se hui charchaa kaa hawala dete hue kaha ki asaram kaa bhi kahana he ki is maamle main ve puri tarah nirdosh hai or kisi bhi jaanch kaa saamana karne ko taiyaar hai
 Uma Bharti said that there should be a thorough high-level inquiry into the matter and if Asaram is found guilty in this case she will punish him himself
 unhone kaha ki 74 varshiya asaram swayan grihasth hai or unke ek betaa or beti hai
 The comments ek prashn ke uttar main uma bharti ne sweekaar kiya ki unki peedit ladki yaa uske parijanon se baatcheet nahin ho pai he
 She said that if possible, she will definitely talk to the girl's parents
 unhone doharaaya ki unki puri sahanubhuti ladki ke saath he, lekin saath hi unka kahana tha ki yadi yah maamla galat sabit hua to sarkaar dwaara banaae gaye nae kanoon se logon kaa vishwaas uth jayega
 Uma Bharti, while discussing on Thursday, said that although she has full sympathy with the girl, the other side is also the way Shankaracharya Jayendra Saraswati was accused of murder by a woman and later acquitted from the court
 And the other party had also admitted to making a wrong complaint against him, in the same way this case is being done

 unhone kaha ki yadi sambhav hua to vah ladkee ke mata pita se avashya baatcheet karengi

 Love hangover is also strange
 jise chaahate hai, uske saamne aate hi dhadakanen bad jaati hai or gudagudi hoti he
 But tension is caused by thinking that the boy whom you want, does he feel the same or not? If your wish is fulfilled, what can be better than this? But how to find out what is in the heart of the boy of your choice? It needs to be a little patient
 sabase jaruri hai ve sanket, jinase pataa chale ki ladkaa bhi aapmen dilchaspee dikhaa rahaa he
 Identify those small hints, whenever you are with a boy of your choice or talking to him
 mind reeding main sab log export nahin ho sakate
 But body language is easy to recognize
 aaie jaanate hai aisi kuch baaten, jinase aap apni pasand ke ladke ke dil kaa haal jaan sakati hai
 
 
 The method of matching eyes is a very important identity
 kisi bhi relationships main ai contact bahut ahm hota he, phir chaahe wo simple dosti ho yaa pyaar
 If the boy only pays attention while talking to you and talks only by looking in your eyes, then understand that he is interested in you
 majaak main kii gai halki-phulki chhedchhad yaa ek-duusare ko tach karnaa bhi ek jaruri pahchaan he
 If he touches you sometimes while joking, then he is showing interest in you and wants to come closer to you
 aapaki taraf uskaa jhukaav bhi aapako hint de saktaa he
 If the boy likes you, then while talking or joking - he will bow towards you or place his head on your shoulder
 ek or bahut baarik hint ye bhi he ki jo ladkaa aapmen dilchaspee dikhaa rahaa he, wo hameshaa aapaki baton ko dhyaan se sunegaa
 While discussing anything, he will listen to you seriously and will also give his opinion
 har ladki compcements kii bhukhi hoti he
 If that guy understands this, then he will definitely give you good supplements
 koi or aapke bare main jo kahe, par wo ladkaa hameshaa aapaki tarif karegaa
 His shyness is also a great hint
 aamtaur par ladkiyaan zyada sharmaati hai
 But some boys turn pink as they get closer to the girl of their choice
 agar wo sharmaataa he, to samaj lijie ki uske dil par aapane kabja kar liya he
 In this era of advanced technology, Kaei also does not remove his phone from himself
 lekin agar wo ladkaa aapke saath hote hue phone ko dur kar detaa he, yaa phone main aane vaale massej or colls se zyada dhyaan par aap detaa he, to samaj jaaie ki ghantiyaan udhar bhi baj rahi hai

 People are dizzy from here to there
 lekin in centres ko kaam nahin mil rahaa
 "we don't understand when our centers are accredited," says Rakesh Kulharia of Sirsa, who runs the center under PMKVVY
 4 star yaa 5 star unhen mili hue hai
 Then why are we not being given work

 Open the center by planting

 But sometimes in the name of verification, sometimes we are not being given work by making the date of center approval a gradient

 If we do not meet the guidelines, then we should be canceled
 hisar se aae rinku kehete hai, rojgaar ke naam par itani badi yojana shuru kii gai
 But what is the idea that how many people get employment when a center is opened and how many people become unemployed if they do not give work without assigning the reasons? For five months, i gave salary to two trainers, a security, guard, receptionist, sweeper but then removed them because we could not find any work
 teen maheene baad hamen aashwaasan mila to hamane phir unhen bula liya
 But now we cannot find work again

 While my center had a capacity of 920 students
 ab aap hi bataaiye ham to barbaad ho gaye na
 Sanjeev Saharan of Hisar told that on 16 May, the Ministry of Skill Development issued a guideline to NSDC that the centers that fit the guidelines be given work
 is guideline main kaha gaya ki jo log 70 fisadi logon ko rojgaar dene kaa lakshya paa chuke hon unhen kaam diya jaae
 Here, the verification was to be physical
 enesdisi ne phir isamen adnga lagaaya or guideline ko todmarodakar kaha job bairiphication ke liye teen maah kii selary slip chahie
 That means it means that only those students who have been employed for three months, will be considered in the job
 aise main teen maah tak centre ko koi kaam nahin milegaa! doosraa adnga lagaaya ki 20 june 2017 ke baad apruv hue centres ko kaam nahin diya jayega
 PMKVY certificate holders not eligible to avail loans under Mudra scheme! Rakesh, Sheetu, Sanjeev says, "now keep one side of this scheme from the students side too
 maan lijie aap is yojana ke tahat kushal ho chuke hai
 Take a certificate and go to the bank and apply for a loan under Mudra Loan
 bank manager is certificate par lone dene ko hi taiyaar nahin hota
 We and many other people running other centers have applied for loans under the Mudra scheme
 magar ek ko bhi lone nahin mila
 'rakesh says that when the country's largest scheme to provide loans to the unemployed will not give loan on this certificate, then how will the certificate of Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana get recognized in other government and non-governmental departments
 kul milakar is yojana kii kai kamjor kadiyaan hai
 And all these links are related to each other

 The aim is to make the unemployed skilled and to sign the skilled people by giving them certificates

 It has not only given clear instructions for hoardings and banners promoting the scheme in every corner and room of the center, but also what size and what kind of material will be there
 kaithal se aae nishanth ne bataaya, disambar 2016 meraa centre riject kar diya gaya tha
 The reason was only that i had protested several times since December 20 last year, as per the guidelines outside, the PMKY centers owners once again protested against the Ministry of Skill and Entrepreneurship on 30th May

 kuch din pehle uttarakhand ke shiksha mantri dhan singh ravat ne bayaan diya tha ki jise uttarakhand main rahanaa he, use vande maataram bolnaa hi hoga
 In response to this statement, Congress President in Uttarakhand Kishore Upadhyay said that under the way it has been said like a challenge, we have decided that Vande Mataram will not be spoken in our programs for a month
 uttarakhand ke mukhyamantri trivendra singh ravatane kishor upaadhyaay ke bayaan par kaha he ki wo unke bayaan ko gambhirtha se nahin lete
 If he has objections to Vande Mataram then the family members of his house must think about him
 vande maataramper kishor upaadhyaay ne kaha, "hamaare sabhi kaaryakramon kii shuruyaat vande maataram se hoti he
 But the way he has said like a challenge and the Chief Minister has examined it, i think it cannot be illegal
 main unase kahata hum, vinamratapurvak kahata hum ki main apane kaaryakramon main ham ek maheene tak vande maataram nahin gaayenge

 i think his topic is not worth discussing
 haa, agar unhen vande maataram par aapatti he to unke ghar parivaar waalon ko jarur unke bare main sochna chahie

 vijay krishna acharya nirdeshit 'dhooma 3' 20 disambar ko cinemagharon main utarane vaali he

 '84 dangon ke cese main peediton kii ore se hai court main daayar yachika par buudhvaar ko sunwaayee hui
 In this, the riot victims have demanded that a conspiracy charge should also be framed against Sajjan Kumar
 isse pehle nichali adaalat ne sajjan ke khilaaf sajeesh ke aarope nahin tay kiye the
 Sajjan Kumar's lawyer said that the testimony of those witnesses and their cross-examination has already been done and on the basis of that, Sajjan Kumar has been acquitted, then how can he be believed on the basis of those witnesses? is
 is maamle main sunwaayee kii agali taarikh 24 may di gai he
 It is worth mentioning that in the 1984 anti-sikh riots case, the Karkardooma Court sentenced 3 convicts to life imprisonment and 2 to three years each
 is maamle main court ne congress netaa sajjan kumaar ko pehle hi bari kar diya tha
 There is anger in the Sikh community over this decision after 29 years on the '84 riots
 piem ne kaha, duniya ke bade-bade netaa bharat ke saath aane ko betabamodi bole- vipaksh chahta tha ki rafel ladaaku vimaan sauda radd ho jaehryana main vidhansabha chunaav se pehle raajnneetik partiyon ne apane prachaar main teji laa di he
 In this episode, Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed an election public meeting in Ballabhgarh on Monday
 piem modi ne is dauraan kaha ki jab main aapke bich haryana main aata hum, to mujhe lagata he ki main apane ghar main aayaa hum
 The development of Haryana and the changes in the lives of the people have always been my priority
 unhone kaha, aaj puri duniya or duniya ke bade-bade netaa bharat ke saath khadey hone or uske saath aane ke liye betaab hai
 From the mandate given by the people, this message has been sent to the world that now the society of India is not divided but stands unitedly with the policy of development and trust
 piem ne kaha, yah logon ke vishwaas or unase mili urja kaa hi nateeja he ki bharat aaj aise faisle le rahaa he, jisaki koi kalpana nahin kar saktaa tha
 i am talking about article 370 here
 unhone kaha, ye haryana kii, puure desh kii bhaavana thi ki jammu-kashmir ko algaav or hinsa se nikaalkar sadbhaav or shashaktikaran kii taraf le jaaya jaae
 Today, Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh have embarked on a new path of development and trust
 vipakshi partiyon par bolaa hamalapiem modi ne ballabhagarh raily main vipakshi partiyon par bhi hamalaa bolaa
 He said, i challenge these people
 agar himmat he to saaf taur par haryana kii janata ko bataaen ki agar ye chunaav jitkar aaenge to 370 or artical 35e ko waapas laaenge

 Watch from Ballabhgarh
 https: / / t
 co / iw6zikirwi — Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) October 14, 2019 Opposition had raised a rage on Rafale: PMPM Modi did not stop here
 unhone kaha,rafel ladaaku vimaanako lekar vipakshi partiyon ne kisi haituba machaai thi
 These people insisted that the Rafale deal be canceled and that new fighter aircraft could not come to India
 lekin inaki tamaam koshishon ke baavjood bharat ko pehla ladaaku vimaan saunpa ja chukaa he
 The PM said, how the Congress and its parties have done, it has been a living proof of One Rank One Pension
 ye log aapse jhooth bolte rahe lekin van rank van pension lagu nahin kiya
 Today, nearly two lakh former soldiers of Haryana have also benefited from this
 in logon ne teen talaak ke khilaaf kanoon ko tarah-tarah ke bahaane banaakar har baar roka
 Kargil's war may have been 18 years, but today two brave warriors of that war, Sanjay Kumar and Subedar Major Yogendra Yadav are ready to fight once again in the current situation of Kashmir
 soobedaar sanjay kumaar kaa kahana he ki, kargil kii jang mere jivan kaa ek ahm hissaa tha
 i spent a large part of my life in Kashmir and after that i got a chance to go to Kargil Jung
 sanjay ne kaha,faujaki hamaari aisi training hoti he ki hamen kisi bhi oparation main koi dikkat nahin aati
 Our seniors used to give us the right opinion at every step
 senior ke paas experions or hamaare paas josh tha
 We received orders to capture a post in the Mashkoh Valley
 us post par lagi do gan se hamen bahut nuksaan ho rahaa tha
 Whenever i get a chance to go to Kashmir again, i will go there with my unit
 pehle bhi hamane kashmir main aatankiyon se muqabla kiya
 The counter-terrorism operations that are going on in Kashmir are more difficult than in the fight
 kyonki usamen pataa nahin chalata ki dushman kahaan chupa he or kab goli chalaa saktaa he
 At the same time, according to Subedar Major Yogendra Yadav, the battle of Kargil was a special battle, because we were not ready in advance
 achaanak hamen aadesh mila ki hamen hamalaa karnaa he
 i had returned after getting married at that time
 meri 19 saal kii umr thi
 a deadly platoon was created to capture the Tiger Hills and i am fortunate to have a chance to visit that platoon
 teesri raat jaakar hamaara dushmano se kontect hua or maut kii parvaah kiye bina ham aage badhate rahe
 My fellow soldiers were martyred one after another
 aakhrikaar hamanen tiger hill ko capchar kiya
 There is a feeling inside every soldier that whenever he gets a chance to destroy enemies he will go to the border
 main bhi hameshaa apane desh ke liye aaj bhi morche par jane ke liye taiyaar hum
 We will not leave a single terrorist until the total terror in Kashmir is over
 soobedaar major yogendra yadav ko is baat kaa malaal bhi he ki ek sainik ko samaaj se jo ucch darje kaa sammaan milanaa chahie wo nahin miltaa he
 The army takes full care and respect of its soldier
 mahadev sadaiv apane bhakton kaa maargdarshan karte rahete hai
 They never forget to show them the right path and motivate them to move towards spiritual life
 agar bhakt hameshaa bhagwaan shiv ke bataae maarg par chalegein to unako kabhi niraashaa haath nahin lagegi or ve sadaiv khush or kushal rahenge
 So let us know today how to achieve success by following the path of Shiva - An incident has been described many times in ancient times in which Lord Shiva is telling Mother Parvati how to achieve success
 ek baar mata parvati ne bhole nath se poocha ki aadhyatmik jivan main safalataa kaise arjeet kii ja sakati he
 Then Lord Shiva told 6 sutras to get success - 1
 vishwaas-bhagwaan shiv kehete hai, apane upar vishwaas rakhana bahut jaruri he
 We can easily reach a destination if we believe in ourselves
 vahiin agar ham niraashaavdi hoge or apane aap ko dusron se kam aakenge to lakshya prapti kathin ho jaaegi
 2
 shraddha- apane kaam ke prati, apane bhagwaan ke prati shraddha hameshaa rakhni chahie
 Patience is the capital of success
 agar ham shraddha or saburi rakhenge, to hamaari har manzil aasaan ban jaaegi
 On the other hand, if we keep our mind always surrounded by doubts, then we cannot do any work with full devotion
 3
 True Guru- It is very important to have a true Guru in everyone's life
 agar guru naa ho to ham dishaheen ho jaaegein
 It is important to always respect the Guru because he shows us the right path, makes us see God and helps us in achieving our goals
 4
 Parity sentiment - To achieve success, one should keep parity
 vyakti ko apane aap ko kabhi bhi naa shreshth samajhnaa chahie naa use khud ko kisi kii tulana main kam aakna chahie
 In both cases, a human falls and he falls down the ladder of success
 5
 Indra nigra- We are always very fickle due to our different senses
 hamaara man bahut vichlit ho jaataa he or ekaagratha bani nahin rahati
 But it is clearly stated in Hinduism that it is necessary to control your senses while worshiping
 isi prakaar agar safalataa chahie to apane man ko sthir rakhana siikhnaa chahie
 6
 satvik bhojan- aisa kaha jaataa he ki aap jis tareeke kaa ann grahan karte hai, aapkaa aachaar bhi vaisaa hi ho jaataa he
 That's why Bholenath says that if you want success, always take satvik food
 tamsik bhojan grahan karne se hamaare sharir ko to nuksaan hota hi he lekin saath main hamaari kaam karne kii kshamta bhi prabhavit ho jaati he

 In fact, thousands of PML-N activists led by the top leaders of the party took out a welcome rally on the return of Nawaz Sharif and his daughter Maryam to Pakistan

 The Congress has been dwarfed by the opposition attack after the Pakistani army killed five Indian soldiers by breaching the Line of Control in Poonch sector
 congress ke saansad or essiasti kamishan ke mukhiya piel puniya se jab is hamale ke bare main sawaal poocha gaya to unhen angrej yaad aa gaye
 Punia said that the Congress has fought the freedom struggle against the British
 hamaari deshbhakti par sawaal nahin uthaa sakate
 After this Punia said that the RSS people were British puppets and traitors
 immergency par fisali puniya kii jabaanaj tak kii reporter se rau main baat kar rahe piel puniya iske baad kuch aisa bol gaye jiske chalate shaayad unhen party alaakaman ko bhi safai deni padi
 Citing the BJP and RSS, Punia said that they should ask the BJP where they were during or before the Emergency
 puniya bhul gaye ki bijepi 1980 main bani or usase pehle bijepi netaa jansangh naam kii party chalaate the, jise sangh kaa aashirwad praapt tha
 Punia forgot that many Jana Sangh leaders and Sangh activists, including Vajpayee and Advani, were in jail during the Emergency
 puniya ye bhi bhul gaye ki jis immergency kaa vah zikr kar rahe hai, use vipaksh or desh congress kii taanaashaahee kaa kaal maanata he
 The Congress also expresses regret for the excesses of those days
 ham nahin karte sansad main hallacongress sansad main shor kyon machaa rahi he bahes ke dauraan
 Punia's answer to this question was that we were not TDP people
 bodoland ke log the, jo shor machaa rahe the
 Then, while giving some correct answers, Punia said that when the TDP people speak, the Congress mps who come from there also have to speak
 aakhri main netaa ji bole ki pakistan ke khilaaf sakht karrwai honi chahie
 It will be interesting to see how the media is reporting in the media, especially in Hindi newspapers, about the allegations leveled against Minister of State for External Affairs MJ Akbar
 kahin par bhi aarope lagane vaali mahilaon kii baaten vistaar se nahin hai
 Where it has appeared prominently, there are many places where the news has been printed as if someone has accused on the way
 aap hairaan ho jaaenge ki kuch hindi akhabaaron main das bees line kii khabar bhi thik se nahin chhapi he
 It is so sad that 9 women journalists have accused the Minister of State for External Affairs, the whole government has gone silent and this news should almost disappear from Hindi newspapers
 ek akhbaar ke kai sanskaran hote hai
 Hard copies are there, e versions are there, websites are there
 bhopal se anuraag dwari ne bataaya ki 10 aktubar ko hindi ke do bade akhabaaron kii hard kapi main akbar kii khabar nahin he
 Millions of his readers would not have come to know, while it is in the news magazine and Bhaskar
 bhaskar ne 9 aktubar ko bhi pehle panne par chapa tha
 Manish Kumar from Patna, the capital of Bihar, told that only Prabhat is in the news
 vahaan kii teen bade hindi akhabaaron main nahin he
 Think this news was not allowed to reach millions of readers
 dehradun ke teen akhabaaron main 9 aktubar ko yah khabar hi nahin thi
 On 10 October, this news was missing in a big newspaper, but in two newspapers, there is a slight way in the inner page
 iske baad hamane chah hindi akhabaaron ke i sanskaran check kiye
 Only three have this news
 teen ke pehle panne par ye khabar nahin he
 In case of e-version, we have only checked the front page
 to hindi akhbaar padhane vaale pathakon tak kya yah khabar samaan rup se pahunch rahi he? akhabaaron ne emje akbar kii khabar kyon nahin chhaapi he, is par meri koi raay nahin he
 Everyone can say that most of the newspapers have news of the charge against Alok Nath
 yani mitu andolan kii khabaren chap rahi hai magar emje akbar kii khabar kahin hai kahin nahin he
 Is this news only for English media? 10 aktubar ke indian express ne pehle panne par akbar par lage aaropon kii khabar lagaai he
 Heading that the six women raised voices, accusing Minister Akbar of sexual harassment when he was the editor
 aaj bhi kai bade angrazi akhbaar main yaa to khabar he nahin yaa phir kahin kinare he
 It was first published by the Telegraph on 9 October
 vaise agar aap website ke hisaab se dekhenge to kareeb kareeb angrezi digital media main ye khabar he
 We did not watch the news channels
 yah isliye bataaya ki media kaa vistaar to hua he magar kya un sabhi plateform se khabaren samaan rup se pathakon tak pahunch rahi hai, ek bade hisse main chuppi kya sirf sampadakeey faisle kaa maamla he? sochie agar 6 se 8 karod pathakon tak pahunchane vaala hindi kaa akhbaar agar is khabar ko chaape hi na to uske pathak kaise jaan paaenge
 Therefore the reader and the viewer also have to change
 use kisi mahatvapurn ghatana yaa khabar kii jaankaree kai madhyamon se check kerani chahie
 Being a voter or a reader in a democracy is even harder than preparing for the IT entrance exam
 aaj akbar ke prasang main ek or lekh aa gaya he
 a woman journalist named Ghazala Wahab has made her objection with Akbar in The Wire
 gazala wahaab FORCE newsmagazine kii kaaryakari sampadak hai
 Ghazala Wahab has written that in the last six months of the Asian Age, the situation got worse from hell
 gazala ne likhaa he ki asian age kii kahani likhnaa aasaan nahin tha
 i thought enough that it would be appropriate to tell after twenty years, but the messages of people kept coming when you would write
 skool main thi jab pita ne akbar kii likhin kitaaben laakar di thim
 Decided to study them and become a journalist
 1994 main di asian age jwine kiya
 i heard people saying that this office is Akbar's harem
 vahaan ladkiyaan bahut zyada thim
 The boys were few
 main is tarah kii gaship sunati thi ki kisase rishte hai
 He has girlfriends in every regional office
 tisare saal asian age ke offis culture ne mujhpe chot kii
 My table was placed outside Akbar's office
 wo mujhe ghoorte rahete the or offis ke network par ashleel massej bhejte rahete the
 Then i started calling in the cabin on the pretext of conversation
 zyaadaatar baatcheet nijee kism kii hoti thi
 Once on the pretext of looking at the dictionary in the room
 main dictionari uthaane ke liye jhuki hi thi ki akbar ne mujhe peeche se pakad liya
 Fingers started turning on my lips
 mere stanon par haath pherane laga
 i tried to free myself but he was held tight
 main kisi tarah chhudaa kar cabin se bhaagi
 She started crying in the toilet
 maine khud se kaha ki dobaaraa nahin hone duungi
 i did not want to be his girlfriend
 lekin mujhe nahin pataa tha ki yaatnaaon kii shuruyaat hone vaali he
 Called again the next day and tried to kiss
 main khud ko chhudaati rahi, lekin vahaan koi jagah nahin thi
 Then he left me
 main bhaagi
 Ran out of the office
 surya kiran building ke baahar bhaagi
 She went to a secluded place and started crying
 gazala wahaab ke saath jo kuch hua, unhone jo likhaa he, uskaa bahut hissaa anuwaad main chhot gaya
 i left because i did not write
 first post website par jis anaam mahila ne emje akbar ke bare main sansmaran likhaa he, wo bhi itnaa hi bhayaavah he
 You can't read mujhe nahin pataa ki ye saare lekh padhakar modi sarkaar ke bheetar kya halchal much rahi he, kyon bijepi ke pravaktaa itane shant ho gaye
 The whole government is engaged to save Akbar or the government has opted out of Akbar
 pradhanmantri modi ne abhi tak nahin bolaa he
 This news has now gone beyond the scope of management
 isliye yah is sarkaar ke ikbaal kaa imtahaan he or akbar kaa bhi
 While many journalists resigned only on accusations, but the editor who is facing such serious allegations, will there be any action, the investigation has not been announced
 mumkin he sarkaar faisla lene main vakt le rahi ho, to use puraa haq he
 It could also be that a new Minister of State for External Affairs is looking for a person whose English is better than Akbar's
 magar sarkaar ke hisaab se kya thik he kya thik nahin he ye tabhi pataa chalegaa jab jawaab milegaa
 Ghazala Wahab was the first girl in her family, decided to come out of the city and home to work
 gazala saatvin mahila patrkaar hai, jinhone public main emje akbar ko lekar apane sansmaran likhe hai
 a total of 9 women journalists have spoken out about MJ Akbar
 kisi ne lekh likhaa he
 Someone has given a statement
 kisi ne twit kiya he
 Sutpa Paul, the founding editor of newcrop, has also written an episode
 sutapa paul ne 10 aktubar kii shaam 32 twit kiye hai or bataae hai ki kaise india today ke kolkata beuro main kaam karne ke dauraan akbar ne sambandh banane ke prayaas kiye
 All these things belong to 2010-11
 gazala wahaab kii aapbeetee kaa ek chota sa hissaa aapane suna
 Priya Ramani had written in 1997 but did not take the name, but took the name this time
 prerana singh bindra ne di vir main apni aapbeetee likhi he
 Suma Raha also told you how she became uncomfortable during the interview in the hotel room and did not accept the job offer
 kanika gahalout ne indian express ko bataaya he ki use bhi hotel main bulaayaa tha magar wo nahin gai, lekin uske baad se akbar ne kuch nahin kiya
 An anonymous female journalist has written in First Post
 wo vivaran bhi sihara dene vaala he
 Prem Panicker has also written his objection
 suparna sharma jo is vakt di asian age kii resident editor hai, unhone indian express se kaha he ki akbar ne unhen ashleel ishaara kiya
 9 women journalists have made serious allegations against MJ Akbar
 kya bharat sarkaar aise vyakti ko ek pal ke liye bhi mantrimandal main rakh sakati he
 This government can tell
 9 mahila patrakaron kaa bayaan saamne he
 Their emergency is in front
 ye sab aarope kii shakl main hai
 Allegedly
 gazala wahaab ne jo likhaa he use bees saal baad kya pachaas saal baad bhi likhnaa aasaan nahin he
 What is the legal significance of this can be debated, but it must have been easy for seven women journalists to come out and speak, write with all the context and context
 isliye emje akbar par jo aarope lagaae hai, us par unka jawaab zaruri he
 Know what the Modi government will decide, many people will think about these 9 women journalists with many questions, but Priya Ramani's niece has written to her aunt
 aant ko
 Aunt Priya i am proud of you that you wrote all this
 aap ek bahut zaruri massej duniya ko de rahi hai
 In my school we girls talk about all these issues in advisory class for twenty minutes
 hamane kawanog or venstin ke bare main charchaa kii
 We will also discuss what you are doing in our class
 maine aapkaa likhaa dikhaaungi ki kaise duniya kii sabhi auraton ko milakar awaz uthaane kii zarurat he
 The IT cell has come to understand the meaning of a media trial since the case came up
 varna yahi aarope emje akbar kii jagah kisi or par lage hote to aap iti cell or tivi channelon main tufaan dekhte
 Still i do not want anyone to have a media trial
 me tu kaa samarthan karne vaali kai mahila patrkaar lagaataar twitor or fasebuk par is antar ko rekhaankit kar rahi hai ki iske tahat koun se aarope gambhir maane jaaenge or koun se mitu nahin maane jaaenge
 Akbar is the attacker among women journalists who have narrated about MJ Akbar
 wo razaamandi kaa intazaar nahin karte, sambandh bhi nahin banaate, balki tut padate hai
 Twenty years ago there was no Visakha Committee
 bees saal pehle is tarah se public spes main mahilaayein nahin bolti thim
 There was no TV and Twitter
 na hi mitu jaisaa maahaul tha
 When the Meitu campaign came, questions were raised on those people who were related to the Left or Liberal camp
 magar tab bhi un sawaalon ko kisi ne sidhe khaarij nahin kiya
 They were heard and they all gave their clarification
 kisi ne nahin bhi di hogi
 In this era of Me Too, caution is being exercised in India at least on the fact that no one can malign someone unnecessarily
 kai media sansthaanon ne emje akbar se unka paksh jaanane ke liye likhaa he
 Awaiting reply
 emje akbar ke saath kaam kar chuki seemaa mustafa ne likhaa he
 On The Citizen website
 is chetavanee ke saath ki ye unke nijee vichaar hai na ki di citision kii sampadakeey niti he
 Seema Mustafa in the beginning of his article has also questioned the modus operandi of the metoo campaign
 seemaa ko mitu andolan ke tevar se bhi samasya he
 One thing of the border is right that many jobs have gone without investigation, without proof
 kya ye thik he
 Seema's article defends Akbar in a way
 unhone likhaa he ki dilli main jis hotel main rukte the wo unke kaam kaa hissaa tha, mujhe yaa kaiyo ko asahaj nahin laga
 He has not had such experience
 tippaniyan There were many girls who were not criticized in front of Akbar, but there were some men about whom Akbar did not listen to anything
 ham bahut kuch shaq karte the magar koi pukhta pramaan nahin hota tha
 At least not within the Asian Age office
 keval atakalbaazi he
 The evidence is nothing and this is true, but the environment in which there is speculation, whisper is not suitable for working
 seemaa mustafa ne yah bhi kaha he ki akbar ko mantripad se hataa dena chahie
 Ghazala Wahab has said in his article that he told Seema Mustafa what has happened to him
 seemaa mustafa ne likhaa he ki gazala ne unase baat kii thi magar ye sab nahin bataaya he jo unhone likhaa he
 On 16 December 1999, Krishna Prasad wrote an article in Rediff titled Editor the Great
 us lekh main in sab baton kaa zikr he jise mahila patrakaron ne likhaa he
 Writing to them, Krishna Prasad repeatedly asks "sir, are you Mr Editor the Great?" Akbar is not named in this article
 magar unke kollam biline kaa baar-baar zikr he
 The editor is referring to the great
 kya aapako lagata he ki pradhanmantri modi emje akbar kaa bachaav karenge? akbar ne haal hi main rafel mudde par rahul gandhi par hamalaa karte hue unke puure khandaan ko chor kaha tha
 Will Modi be able to say instead that my great Akbar
 vaise akbar kaa mahaan hona sangh ko acha nahin lagata he
 i was talking about Akbar with history
 is vaale akbar kii angrezi bahut acchhee he
 If English is good in India, then it becomes your rule
 bhaskar ne 9 aktubar ko bhi pehle panne par chapa tha
 Manish Kumar from Patna, the capital of Bihar, told that only Prabhat is in the news

 yah isliye bataaya ki media kaa vistaar to hua he magar kya un sabhi plateform se khabaren samaan rup se pathakon tak pahunch rahi hai, ek bade hisse main chuppi kya sirf sampadakeey faisle kaa maamla he? sochie agar 6 se 8 karod pathakon tak pahunchane vaala hindi kaa akhbaar agar is khabar ko chaape hi na to uske pathak kaise jaan paaenge
 Therefore the reader and the viewer also have to change
 use kisi mahatvapurn ghatana yaa khabar kii jaankaree kai madhyamon se check kerani chahie
 Being a voter or a reader in a democracy is even harder than preparing for the IT entrance exam
 aaj akbar ke prasang main ek or lekh aa gaya he
 a woman journalist named Ghazala Wahab has made her objection with Akbar in The Wire
 gazala wahaab FORCE newsmagazine kii kaaryakari sampadak hai
 Ghazala Wahab has written that in the last six months of the Asian Age, the situation got worse from hell
 gazala ne likhaa he ki asian age kii kahani likhnaa aasaan nahin tha
 i thought enough that it would be appropriate to tell after twenty years, but the messages of people kept coming when you would write
 skool main thi jab pita ne akbar kii likhin kitaaben laakar di thim
 Decided to study them and become a journalist
 1994 main di asian age jwine kiya
 i heard people saying that this office is Akbar's harem
 vahaan ladkiyaan bahut zyada thim
 The boys were few
 main is tarah kii gaship sunati thi ki kisase rishte hai
 He has girlfriends in every regional office
 tisare saal asian age ke offis culture ne mujhpe chot kii
 My table was placed outside Akbar's office
 wo mujhe ghoorte rahete the or offis ke network par ashleel massej bhejte rahete the
 Then i started calling in the cabin on the pretext of conversation
 zyaadaatar baatcheet nijee kism kii hoti thi
 Once on the pretext of looking at the dictionary in the room
 main dictionari uthaane ke liye jhuki hi thi ki akbar ne mujhe peeche se pakad liya
 Fingers started turning on my lips
 mere stanon par haath pherane laga
 i tried to free myself but he was held tight
 main kisi tarah chhudaa kar cabin se bhaagi
 She started crying in the toilet
 maine khud se kaha ki dobaaraa nahin hone duungi
 i did not want to be his girlfriend
 lekin mujhe nahin pataa tha ki yaatnaaon kii shuruyaat hone vaali he
 Called again the next day and tried to kiss
 main khud ko chhudaati rahi, lekin vahaan koi jagah nahin thi
 Then he left me
 main bhaagi
 Ran out of the office
 surya kiran building ke baahar bhaagi
 She went to a secluded place and started crying
 gazala wahaab ke saath jo kuch hua, unhone jo likhaa he, uskaa bahut hissaa anuwaad main chhot gaya
 i left because i did not write
 first post website par jis anaam mahila ne emje akbar ke bare main sansmaran likhaa he, wo bhi itnaa hi bhayaavah he
 You can't read mujhe nahin pataa ki ye saare lekh padhakar modi sarkaar ke bheetar kya halchal much rahi he, kyon bijepi ke pravaktaa itane shant ho gaye
 The whole government is engaged to save Akbar or the government has opted out of Akbar
 pradhanmantri modi ne abhi tak nahin bolaa he
 This news has now gone beyond the scope of management
 isliye yah is sarkaar ke ikbaal kaa imtahaan he or akbar kaa bhi
 While many journalists resigned only on accusations, but the editor who is facing such serious allegations, will there be any action, the investigation has not been announced
 mumkin he sarkaar faisla lene main vakt le rahi ho, to use puraa haq he
 It could also be that a new Minister of State for External Affairs is looking for a person whose English is better than Akbar's
 magar sarkaar ke hisaab se kya thik he kya thik nahin he ye tabhi pataa chalegaa jab jawaab milegaa
 Ghazala Wahab was the first girl in her family, decided to come out of the city and home to work
 gazala saatvin mahila patrkaar hai, jinhone public main emje akbar ko lekar apane sansmaran likhe hai
 a total of 9 women journalists have spoken out about MJ Akbar
 kisi ne lekh likhaa he
 Someone has given a statement
 kisi ne twit kiya he
 Sutpa Paul, the founding editor of newcrop, has also written an episode
 sutapa paul ne 10 aktubar kii shaam 32 twit kiye hai or bataae hai ki kaise india today ke kolkata beuro main kaam karne ke dauraan akbar ne sambandh banane ke prayaas kiye
 All these things belong to 2010-11
 gazala wahaab kii aapbeetee kaa ek chota sa hissaa aapane suna
 Priya Ramani had written in 1997 but did not take the name, but took the name this time
 prerana singh bindra ne di vir main apni aapbeetee likhi he
 Suma Raha also told you how she became uncomfortable during the interview in the hotel room and did not accept the job offer
 kanika gahalout ne indian express ko bataaya he ki use bhi hotel main bulaayaa tha magar wo nahin gai, lekin uske baad se akbar ne kuch nahin kiya
 An anonymous female journalist has written in First Post
 wo vivaran bhi sihara dene vaala he
 Prem Panicker has also written his objection
 suparna sharma jo is vakt di asian age kii resident editor hai, unhone indian express se kaha he ki akbar ne unhen ashleel ishaara kiya
 9 women journalists have made serious allegations against MJ Akbar
 kya bharat sarkaar aise vyakti ko ek pal ke liye bhi mantrimandal main rakh sakati he
 This government can tell
 9 mahila patrakaron kaa bayaan saamne he
 Their emergency is in front
 ye sab aarope kii shakl main hai
 Allegedly
 gazala wahaab ne jo likhaa he use bees saal baad kya pachaas saal baad bhi likhnaa aasaan nahin he
 What is the legal significance of this can be debated, but it must have been easy for seven women journalists to come out and speak, write with all the context and context
 isliye emje akbar par jo aarope lagaae hai, us par unka jawaab zaruri he
 Know what the Modi government will decide, many people will think about these 9 women journalists with many questions, but Priya Ramani's niece has written to her aunt
 aant ko
 Aunt Priya i am proud of you that you wrote all this
 aap ek bahut zaruri massej duniya ko de rahi hai
 In my school we girls talk about all these issues in advisory class for twenty minutes

 We will also discuss what you are doing in our class
 maine aapkaa likhaa dikhaaungi ki kaise duniya kii sabhi auraton ko milakar awaz uthaane kii zarurat he
 The IT cell has come to understand the meaning of a media trial since the case came up
 varna yahi aarope emje akbar kii jagah kisi or par lage hote to aap iti cell or tivi channelon main tufaan dekhte
 Still i do not want anyone to have a media trial
 me tu kaa samarthan karne vaali kai mahila patrkaar lagaataar twitor or fasebuk par is antar ko rekhaankit kar rahi hai ki iske tahat koun se aarope gambhir maane jaaenge or koun se mitu nahin maane jaaenge
 Akbar is the attacker among women journalists who have narrated about MJ Akbar
 wo razaamandi kaa intazaar nahin karte, sambandh bhi nahin banaate, balki tut padate hai
 Twenty years ago there was no Visakha Committee
 bees saal pehle is tarah se public spes main mahilaayein nahin bolti thim
 There was no TV and Twitter
 na hi mitu jaisaa maahaul tha
 When the Meitu campaign came, questions were raised on those people who were related to the Left or Liberal camp
 magar tab bhi un sawaalon ko kisi ne sidhe khaarij nahin kiya
 They were heard and they all gave their clarification
 kisi ne nahin bhi di hogi
 In this era of Me Too, caution is being exercised in India at least on the fact that no one can malign someone unnecessarily
 kai media sansthaanon ne emje akbar se unka paksh jaanane ke liye likhaa he
 Awaiting reply
 emje akbar ke saath kaam kar chuki seemaa mustafa ne likhaa he
 On The Citizen website

 Seema Mustafa in the beginning of his article has also questioned the modus operandi of the metoo campaign
 seemaa ko mitu andolan ke tevar se bhi samasya he
 One thing of the border is right that many jobs have gone without investigation, without proof
 kya ye thik he
 Seema's article defends Akbar in a way
 unhone likhaa he ki dilli main jis hotel main rukte the wo unke kaam kaa hissaa tha, mujhe yaa kaiyo ko asahaj nahin laga
 He has not had such experience
 tippaniyan There were many girls who were not criticized in front of Akbar, but there were some men about whom Akbar did not listen to anything
 ham bahut kuch shaq karte the magar koi pukhta pramaan nahin hota tha
 At least not within the Asian Age office
 keval atakalbaazi he
 The evidence is nothing and this is true, but the environment in which there is speculation, whisper is not suitable for working
 seemaa mustafa ne yah bhi kaha he ki akbar ko mantripad se hataa dena chahie
 Ghazala Wahab has said in his article that he told Seema Mustafa what has happened to him
 seemaa mustafa ne likhaa he ki gazala ne unase baat kii thi magar ye sab nahin bataaya he jo unhone likhaa he
 On 16 December 1999, Krishna Prasad wrote an article in Rediff titled Editor the Great
 us lekh main in sab baton kaa zikr he jise mahila patrakaron ne likhaa he
 Writing to them, Krishna Prasad repeatedly asks "sir, are you Mr Editor the Great?" Akbar is not named in this article
 magar unke kollam biline kaa baar-baar zikr he
 The editor is referring to the great
 kya aapako lagata he ki pradhanmantri modi emje akbar kaa bachaav karenge? akbar ne haal hi main rafel mudde par rahul gandhi par hamalaa karte hue unke puure khandaan ko chor kaha tha
 Will Modi be able to say instead that my great Akbar
 vaise akbar kaa mahaan hona sangh ko acha nahin lagata he

 If English is good in India, then it becomes your rule

 Heading that the six women raised voices, accusing Minister Akbar of sexual harassment when he was the editor

 It was first published by the Telegraph on 9 October

 gazala wahaab ne likhaa he asian age ke aakhri chah maheene main halaat narak se badtar ho gaye the
 Ghazala has written that it was not easy to write the story of the Asian Age
 maine kaaphi sochaa ki bees saal baad ye bataanaa kya uchit rahegaa, lekin logon ke messej aate rahe ki tum kab likhogi
 She was in school when the father brought books written by Akbar
 unhen padhakar patrkaar banane kaa faisla kiya
 Joined The Asian Age in 1994
 maine logon ko yah kehete suna ki yah offis akbar kaa haram he
 The girls were very much there
 ladke kam the
 i used to listen to such gossip about who is related to whom
 har riginal offis main unke garlfrand hai
 In the third year, Asian Age office culture hurt me
 meri mez akbar ke offis ke baahar laga di gai
 He kept staring at me and sending obscene messages on the office network
 phir mujhe baatcheet ke bahaane cabin main bulaane lage
 Most of the conversations were private
 ek baar kamare main dictionari dekhne ke bahaane bula liya
 i was bent to lift the dictionary that Akbar grabbed me from behind
 mere hothon par ungliyaan pherane lage
 Turned my hand over my breasts
 maine khud ko chhudaane kii koshish kii magar usne kas ke jakad liya tha
 i somehow escaped and escaped from the cabin
 toilet main jaakar rone lagi
 i told myself not to let it happen again
 main uski garlfrand nahin bananaa chaahati thi
 But i did not know that the tortures were about to begin
 agle din phir bulaayaa or kis karne kaa prayaas kiya
 i kept myself free, but there was no place
 phir usne mujhe chhod diya
 i ran
 daftar se baahar bhaagi
 Surya Kiran ran outside the building
 ek sunsaan jagah par jaakar rone lagi
 Whatever happened to Ghazala Wahab, much of what he has written, was left in translation
 maine chhod diya kyonki mujhase nahin likhaa gaya
 The anonymous woman who wrote a memoir about MJ Akbar on the First Post website is equally frightening
 aap pard nahin sakate
 i do not know what is creating a stir within the Modi government after reading all these articles, why the BJP spokesperson became so calm
 akbar ko bachaane ke liye sari sarkaar lagi hui he yaa sarkaar ne akbar se kinaaraa kar liya he
 Prime Minister Modi has not spoken yet
 yah khabar ab manage karne ke daayre se baahar ja chuki he
 Therefore, it is the test of Iqbal of this government and also of Akbar
 jahaan mahaz aarope lagane par kai patrakaron ne istife de diya lekin jis sampadak par itane gambhir aarope lage hai, kya koi ection nahin hoga, jaanch kii ghoshnaa tak nahin hui he
 It is possible that if the government is taking time to take a decision, then it has every right
 yah bhi ho saktaa he ki nae videsh rajya mantri kii talash ho rahi ho jinaki angrezi akbar se acchhee ho to isamen bhi koi buraai nahin he
 But according to the government, what is right and what is not right, it will be known only when the answer is found
 gazala wahaab apane parivaar kii pehali ladki thim, shahar or ghar se baahar aakar naukari karne kaa faisla kiya tha
 Ghazala is the seventh woman journalist to have written her memoirs about MJ Akbar in public
 kul 9 mahila patrakaron ne emje akbar ko lekar aapbeetee bataai he
 Someone has written an article
 kisi ne bayaan diya he
 Someone tweeted
 sutapa paul, newcrop kii sansthaapak sampadak hai, unhone bhi aapbeetee likhi he
 Sutpa Paul has tweeted 32 on the evening of 10 October and described how Akbar made efforts to build a relationship while working at the Kolkata bureau of India Today
 yah sari baaten 2010-11 kii hai
 You heard a small part of Ghazala Wahab's tragedy
 priya ramani ne to 1997 main hi likhaa tha magar naam nahin liya, lekin is baar naam le liya
 Prerna Singh Bindra has written her objection in The Wire
 suma rahaa ne bhi aapbeetee bataai ki kaise hotel ke kamare main intervyuu ke dauraan ve asahaj ho gayi or naukari kaa prastaav sweekaar nahin kiya
 Kanika Gehlot has told the Indian Express that she too was called to the hotel but she did not go, but since then Akbar has done nothing
 ek anaam mahila patrkaar ne first post main likhaa he
 That description is also shining
 prem panikar ne bhi apni aapbeetee likhi he
 Suparna Sharma, who is currently the Resident Editor of The Asian Age, told The Indian Express that Akbar made a vulgar gesture to her
 em je akbar par 9 mahila patrakaron ne gambhir aarope lagaae hai
 Can the Government of India put such a person in the Cabinet even for a moment
 yah sarkaar bataa sakati he
 The statement of 9 women journalists is in front
 unki aapbeetee saamne he
 These are all in the shape of accusations
 kathith rup se
 Is it not easy to write what Ghazala Wahab has written even after fifty years? iskaa kanoonee mahatv kya he, is par bahes ho sakati he, lekin saat mahila patrakaron kaa baahar aakar bolnaa, saare prasang or sandarbh ke saath likhnaa kya unke liye aasaan rahaa hoga
 Therefore, the allegations made on MJ Akbar need to be answered
 modi sarkaar kya faisla karegi wo jane, bahut se log in 9 mahila patrakaron ke bare main kai sawaalon ke saath sochenge, magar priya ramani kii bhatiji ne apni chachee ko likhaa he
 To the aunt
 antee priya mujhe aap par garv he ki aapane ye sab likhaa
 You are giving a very important message to the world
 mere skool main ham ladikayaan bees minute ke liye adwiseri class main in sab muddon par baat karte hai
 We discussed Kavanog and Vensteen
 ham apane class main aap jo kar rahi hai, us par bhi charchaa karenge
 i will show you how all the women of the world need to raise their voices together
 iti cell is maamle ke aane ke baad media trial ke matlab ko samaj gaya he
 Otherwise, instead of MJ Akbar, you would have seen the same allegations in IT cell and TV channels
 phir bhi main nahin chahta ki kisi kaa media trial ho
 Many women journalists who support Me Two are constantly highlighting the difference between Twitter and Facebook as to which allegations would be considered as serious and which would not be considered as metu
 emje akbar ke bare main mahila patrakaron ne jo prasang sunaaen hai, sabamein akbar hamalavar hai
 They do not wait for consent, do not make relations, but are broken
 bees saal pehle vishakha cameti nahin thi
 Twenty years ago, women did not speak in this way in the public space
 tivi or twitor nahin tha
 Nor was the atmosphere like Meatu
 mitu abhiyaan aayaa tab shuru ke dinon un logon par sawaal uthe, jinka sambandh left yaa libral kheme se tha
 But even then no one directly rejected those questions
 unhen suna gaya or un sabhi ne apni safai di
 Nobody would have given it
 me tu ke is daur main bharat main kam se kam is baat ko lekar satarkta barti ja rahi ki koi kisi ko bevajaah badnaam na kar paae
 Many media institutions have written to MJ Akbar to know his side
 jawaab kaa intazaar kiya ja rahaa he
 Seema Mustafa, who has worked with MJ Akbar, has written
 di citision website par
 With the caveat that these are his personal views, not The Citizen's editorial policy
 seemaa mustafa ne apane lekh kii shuruyaat main mitu abhiyaan ke taur tareekon par bhi sawaal uthaae hai
 Seema also has a problem with the Meitu movement
 seemaa kii ek baat thik he ki bina jaanch ke, bina pramaan ke kaiyon kii naukariyaan chali gayi
 Is that ok seemaa kaa lekh ek tarah se akbar kaa bachaav karata he
 He has written that the hotel in which he stayed in Delhi was part of his work, i or Kayo did not feel uncomfortable
 unka aisa anubhav nahin rahaa he
 The comments kai ladkiyaan thim jinaki aalochana akbar ke saamne nahin hoti thi, lekin aise kuch purush bhi thi jinke bare main akbar kuch bhi nahin sunate the
 We used to doubt a lot but there was no strong evidence
 kam se kam asian age ke offis ke bheetar to bilkul hi nahin
 There is only speculation
 pramaan kuch nahin he or yahi sach he, lekin jis maahaul main atakalein hon, kaanaafoosee hon wo jagah kaam karne ke liye anukool bhi nahin hoti he
 Seema Mustafa has also said that Akbar should be removed from the ministry
 gazala wahaab ne apane lekh main kaha he ki unhone seemaa mustafa ko bataaya tha ki unke saath kya hua he
 Seema Mustafa has written that Ghazala spoke to him but has not told all that he has written
 16 disambar 1999 main krishna prasad ne radiff main Editor the Great naam se ek lekh likhaa tha
 All these things are mentioned in the article which has been written by women journalists
 inhen likhte hue krishna prasad baar-baar poochhate hai ki "sir, are you Mr Editor the Great?" is lekh main akbar kaa naam nahin he
 But his column byline is frequently mentioned
 editor di great kaa zikr he
 Do you think that Prime Minister Modi will defend MJ Akbar? Akbar recently attacked Rahul Gandhi on the Rafale issue, calling his entire family a thief
 kya modi iske badale kah paaenge ki meraa akbar mahaan
 However, the Sangh does not like Akbar's greatness
 main itihaas vaale akbar kii baat kar rahaa tha
 This one's Akbar's English is very good
 bharat main angrezi acchhee ho to hukumat aapaki ho jaati he
 Whatever happened to Ghazala Wahab, much of what he has written, was left in translation
 maine chhod diya kyonki mujhase nahin likhaa gaya
 The anonymous woman who wrote a memoir about MJ Akbar on the First Post website is equally frightening
 aap pard nahin sakate
 i do not know what is creating a stir within the Modi government after reading all these articles, why the BJP spokesperson became so calm
 akbar ko bachaane ke liye sari sarkaar lagi hui he yaa sarkaar ne akbar se kinaaraa kar liya he
 Prime Minister Modi has not spoken yet
 yah khabar ab manage karne ke daayre se baahar ja chuki he
 Therefore, it is the test of Iqbal of this government and also of Akbar
 jahaan mahaz aarope lagane par kai patrakaron ne istife de diya lekin jis sampadak par itane gambhir aarope lage hai, kya koi ection nahin hoga, jaanch kii ghoshnaa tak nahin hui he
 It is possible that if the government is taking time to take a decision, then it has every right
 yah bhi ho saktaa he ki nae videsh rajya mantri kii talash ho rahi ho jinaki angrezi akbar se acchhee ho to isamen bhi koi buraai nahin he
 But according to the government, what is right and what is not right, it will be known only when the answer is found
 gazala wahaab apane parivaar kii pehali ladki thim, shahar or ghar se baahar aakar naukari karne kaa faisla kiya tha
 Ghazala is the seventh woman journalist to have written her memoirs about MJ Akbar in public
 kul 9 mahila patrakaron ne emje akbar ko lekar aapbeetee bataai he
 Someone has written an article
 kisi ne bayaan diya he
 Someone tweeted
 sutapa paul, newcrop kii sansthaapak sampadak hai, unhone bhi aapbeetee likhi he
 Sutpa Paul has tweeted 32 on the evening of 10 October and described how Akbar made efforts to build a relationship while working at the Kolkata bureau of India Today
 yah sari baaten 2010-11 kii hai
 You heard a small part of Ghazala Wahab's tragedy
 priya ramani ne to 1997 main hi likhaa tha magar naam nahin liya, lekin is baar naam le liya
 Prerna Singh Bindra has written her objection in The Wire
 suma rahaa ne bhi aapbeetee bataai ki kaise hotel ke kamare main intervyuu ke dauraan ve asahaj ho gayi or naukari kaa prastaav sweekaar nahin kiya
 Kanika Gehlot has told the Indian Express that she too was called to the hotel but she did not go, but since then Akbar has done nothing
 ek anaam mahila patrkaar ne first post main likhaa he
 That description is also shining
 prem panikar ne bhi apni aapbeetee likhi he
 Suparna Sharma, who is currently the Resident Editor of The Asian Age, told The Indian Express that Akbar made a vulgar gesture to her
 em je akbar par 9 mahila patrakaron ne gambhir aarope lagaae hai
 Can the Government of India put such a person in the Cabinet even for a moment
 yah sarkaar bataa sakati he
 The statement of 9 women journalists is in front
 unki aapbeetee saamne he
 These are all in the shape of accusations
 kathith rup se
 Is it not easy to write what Ghazala Wahab has written even after fifty years? iskaa kanoonee mahatv kya he, is par bahes ho sakati he, lekin saat mahila patrakaron kaa baahar aakar bolnaa, saare prasang or sandarbh ke saath likhnaa kya unke liye aasaan rahaa hoga
 Therefore, the allegations made on MJ Akbar need to be answered
 modi sarkaar kya faisla karegi wo jane, bahut se log in 9 mahila patrakaron ke bare main kai sawaalon ke saath sochenge, magar priya ramani kii bhatiji ne apni chachee ko likhaa he
 To the aunt
 antee priya mujhe aap par garv he ki aapane ye sab likhaa
 You are giving a very important message to the world
 mere skool main ham ladikayaan bees minute ke liye adwiseri class main in sab muddon par baat karte hai
 We discussed Kavanog and Vensteen
 ham apane class main aap jo kar rahi hai, us par bhi charchaa karenge
 i will show you how all the women of the world need to raise their voices together
 iti cell is maamle ke aane ke baad media trial ke matlab ko samaj gaya he
 Otherwise, instead of MJ Akbar, you would have seen the same allegations in IT cell and TV channels
 phir bhi main nahin chahta ki kisi kaa media trial ho
 Many women journalists who support Me Two are constantly highlighting the difference between Twitter and Facebook as to which allegations would be considered as serious and which would not be considered as metu
 emje akbar ke bare main mahila patrakaron ne jo prasang sunaaen hai, sabamein akbar hamalavar hai
 They do not wait for consent, do not make relations, but are broken
 bees saal pehle vishakha cameti nahin thi
 Twenty years ago, women did not speak in this way in the public space
 tivi or twitor nahin tha
 Nor was the atmosphere like Meatu
 mitu abhiyaan aayaa tab shuru ke dinon un logon par sawaal uthe, jinka sambandh left yaa libral kheme se tha
 But even then no one directly rejected those questions
 unhen suna gaya or un sabhi ne apni safai di
 Nobody would have given it
 me tu ke is daur main bharat main kam se kam is baat ko lekar satarkta barti ja rahi ki koi kisi ko bevajaah badnaam na kar paae
 Many media institutions have written to MJ Akbar to know his side
 jawaab kaa intazaar kiya ja rahaa he
 Seema Mustafa, who has worked with MJ Akbar, has written
 di citision website par
 With the caveat that these are his personal views, not The Citizen's editorial policy
 seemaa mustafa ne apane lekh kii shuruyaat main mitu abhiyaan ke taur tareekon par bhi sawaal uthaae hai
 Seema also has a problem with the Meitu movement
 seemaa kii ek baat thik he ki bina jaanch ke, bina pramaan ke kaiyon kii naukariyaan chali gayi
 Is that ok seemaa kaa lekh ek tarah se akbar kaa bachaav karata he
 He has written that the hotel in which he stayed in Delhi was part of his work, i or Kayo did not feel uncomfortable
 unka aisa anubhav nahin rahaa he
 The comments kai ladkiyaan thim jinaki aalochana akbar ke saamne nahin hoti thi, lekin aise kuch purush bhi thi jinke bare main akbar kuch bhi nahin sunate the
 We used to doubt a lot but there was no strong evidence
 kam se kam asian age ke offis ke bheetar to bilkul hi nahin
 There is only speculation
 pramaan kuch nahin he or yahi sach he, lekin jis maahaul main atakalein hon, kaanaafoosee hon wo jagah kaam karne ke liye anukool bhi nahin hoti he
 Seema Mustafa has also said that Akbar should be removed from the ministry
 gazala wahaab ne apane lekh main kaha he ki unhone seemaa mustafa ko bataaya tha ki unke saath kya hua he
 Seema Mustafa has written that Ghazala spoke to him but has not told all that he has written
 16 disambar 1999 main krishna prasad ne radiff main Editor the Great naam se ek lekh likhaa tha
 All these things are mentioned in the article which has been written by women journalists
 inhen likhte hue krishna prasad baar-baar poochhate hai ki "sir, are you Mr Editor the Great?" is lekh main akbar kaa naam nahin he
 But his column byline is frequently mentioned

 Do you think that Prime Minister Modi will defend MJ Akbar? Akbar recently attacked Rahul Gandhi on the Rafale issue, calling his entire family a thief

 Ghazala Wahab was the first girl in her family, decided to come out of the city and home to work
 gazala saatvin mahila patrkaar hai, jinhone public main emje akbar ko lekar apane sansmaran likhe hai
 a total of 9 women journalists have spoken out about MJ Akbar
 kisi ne lekh likhaa he
 Someone has given a statement
 kisi ne twit kiya he
 Sutpa Paul, the founding editor of newcrop, has also written an episode
 sutapa paul ne 10 aktubar kii shaam 32 twit kiye hai or bataae hai ki kaise india today ke kolkata beuro main kaam karne ke dauraan akbar ne sambandh banane ke prayaas kiye
 All these things belong to 2010-11
 gazala wahaab kii aapbeetee kaa ek chota sa hissaa aapane suna
 Priya Ramani had written in 1997 but did not take the name, but took the name this time
 prerana singh bindra ne di vir main apni aapbeetee likhi he
 Suma Raha also told you how she became uncomfortable during the interview in the hotel room and did not accept the job offer
 kanika gahalout ne indian express ko bataaya he ki use bhi hotel main bulaayaa tha magar wo nahin gai, lekin uske baad se akbar ne kuch nahin kiya
 An anonymous female journalist has written in First Post
 wo vivaran bhi sihara dene vaala he
 Prem Panicker has also written his objection
 suparna sharma jo is vakt di asian age kii resident editor hai, unhone indian express se kaha he ki akbar ne unhen ashleel ishaara kiya
 9 women journalists have made serious allegations against MJ Akbar
 kya bharat sarkaar aise vyakti ko ek pal ke liye bhi mantrimandal main rakh sakati he
 This government can tell
 9 mahila patrakaron kaa bayaan saamne he
 Their emergency is in front
 ye sab aarope kii shakl main hai
 Allegedly
 gazala wahaab ne jo likhaa he use bees saal baad kya pachaas saal baad bhi likhnaa aasaan nahin he
 What is the legal significance of this can be debated, but it must have been easy for seven women journalists to come out and speak, write with all the context and context
 isliye emje akbar par jo aarope lagaae hai, us par unka jawaab zaruri he
 Know what the Modi government will decide, many people will think about these 9 women journalists with many questions, but Priya Ramani's niece has written to her aunt
 aant ko
 Aunt Priya i am proud of you that you wrote all this

 The IT cell has come to understand the meaning of a media trial since the case came up
 varna yahi aarope emje akbar kii jagah kisi or par lage hote to aap iti cell or tivi channelon main tufaan dekhte
 Still i do not want anyone to have a media trial

 Akbar is the attacker among women journalists who have narrated about MJ Akbar

 Twenty years ago there was no Visakha Committee

 One thing of the border is right that many jobs have gone without investigation, without proof
 kya ye thik he
 Seema's article defends Akbar in a way
 unhone likhaa he ki dilli main jis hotel main rukte the wo unke kaam kaa hissaa tha, mujhe yaa kaiyo ko asahaj nahin laga
 He has not had such experience
 tippaniyan There were many girls who were not criticized in front of Akbar, but there were some men about whom Akbar did not listen to anything
 ham bahut kuch shaq karte the magar koi pukhta pramaan nahin hota tha
 At least not within the Asian Age office

 The evidence is nothing and this is true, but the environment in which there is speculation, whisper is not suitable for working
 seemaa mustafa ne yah bhi kaha he ki akbar ko mantripad se hataa dena chahie
 Ghazala Wahab has said in his article that he told Seema Mustafa what has happened to him
 seemaa mustafa ne likhaa he ki gazala ne unase baat kii thi magar ye sab nahin bataaya he jo unhone likhaa he
 On 16 December 1999, Krishna Prasad wrote an article in Rediff titled Editor the Great
 us lekh main in sab baton kaa zikr he jise mahila patrakaron ne likhaa he
 Writing to them, Krishna Prasad repeatedly asks "sir, are you Mr Editor the Great?" Akbar is not named in this article
 magar unke kollam biline kaa baar-baar zikr he
 The editor is referring to the great

 karnataka main teen din tak chale siyaasi sangram ke baad aakhir main yediurppa ne bahumat pareekshan se pehle vidhansabha ke bheetar apane istife kaa elaan kar diya
 BJP did not seem to be able to collect the majority figure in the assembly, in such a situation, Yeddyurappa failed to resign after failing in the floor test
 lekin ab gend duusare paale main pahunch gai he
 On behalf of the congress-jds alliance, the CM candidate Kumaraswamy has been invited by the Governor to form the government
 kumaraswami ab somvaar ko 12 se ek baje ke bich mukhyamantri pad kii shapath le sakate hai
 However, it will be interesting to see how much time the Governor gives to the congress-jds alliance for a majority test
 rajyapal kii ore se yediurppa sarkaar ko bahumat siddh karne ke liye 15 din kaa vakt diya gaya tha jabaki yediurppa khud 7 din main bahumat siddh karne kaa daawa karte rahe the
 However, after the plea of congress-jds, the Supreme Court had reduced the floor test period to 24 hours
 iske faisle ke mutabik hi shanivaar ko shaam 4 baje floor test hona nirdhaarit tha
 Kumaraswamy will become CM! After Yeddyurappa's resignation, JDS chief Kumaraswamy is awaiting invitation from the Governor to form the government
 congress ne chunaav nateezon main pichad jane ke baad tisare number kii party jedies cobina shart ke samarthandene kaa elaan kar diya tha or kumaraswami ko mukhyamantri banane par bhi sahmati ban gai thi
 Now the exam time is also for jds-congress alliance
 sarkaar banane ke nyote baad gathbandhan ko bhi floor test se guzarana hoga
 In such a situation, it is being speculated that Kumaraswamy may be ready for the floor test as soon as he is afraid that the BJP will not make a dent in his camp
 haal ke ghatnakram main agar bahumat sabit karne main bijepi vifal rahi he to jaahir taur par jedies-congress gathbandhan ko is test main paas hone main mushkil aane kii sambhaavna kam hi he
 What was the result? In the results of 222 seats in the Karnataka Assembly elections, BJP got 104 seats, and this number is 7 less than the majority
 duusari ore, congress ko 78 or jedies ko 37, basapa ko 1 or anya ko 2 siten mili hai
 Kumaraswamy won 2 seats, so 111 mlas were needed for a majority

 or iske baad hi police ne exiaar darj kiya
 Andhra Pradesh DGP JV Ramudu had told after the encounter that 10 teams of 20 security personnel were involved in this operation

 raaj babbar ne itnaa bhar kaha ki mumbai main 12 rupee main bharpayt khaanaa khaaya ja saktaa he, or desh aag babula he
 Hindus are known all over the world for their tammies while arguing
 aise main koi soch bhi kaise saktaa he aam janata jise na arthvyavastha ke bare main kuch pataa he or na raaj chalaane ke bare main kuch, vah ek saansad ko gyaan degi ki kya kaha jaae or kya nahin
 The country for which Mahatma Gandhi gave his life, in which worrying about Nehruji fell ill, that country should be so grateful! Gandhi and Nehru would be astonished to see in Rajghat and Shantivan that the people of their country would be their mps, their leaders Do not even respect netaa to chhodie abhinayta ko bhi nahin bakhsha
 Have the days gone by, when we were filled with reverence by seeing the leaders and spraying garlands on the actors
 yahaan ek bhala maanush he, jo actor tha or ab saansad he, wo aapako ek kamaal kii cheez bataa rahaa he, jisase ek jatke main bhukhmaree dur ho sakati he or aap hai ki hai tauba machaa rahe hai
 Hey, if you have to ask questions then ask relevant question, Raj Babbar saheb, where is the place in Mumbai where food is available for 12 rupees
 jaise hi ye sawaal poocha jaataa, babbar ko apana bayaan waapas lenaa padataa
 Neither are they lying, in fact it is confidential and they have sworn office and secrecy
 kisi saansad ko bhi iskaa khulaasa karne kaa haq nahin he, chaahe vah abhinayta kyon naa rahaa ho
 The revelations do not stop here
 ek or saansad rashid masood ke mutabik 12 rupee to bahut zyada hai
 Money is puri bharpayt khaanaa to paanch rupee main hi mil jaataa he
 Now you cannot even ask Masood where to get such cheap food
 kyonki ab aap jaanate hai ki ye bhi atigopneey he
 Farukh Abdullah had another voice in this carnival
 unhone aisa sawaal poocha ki babbar or masood bhi baglein jhaakane lagen
 ibn-e-shere-kashmir belched long and said that the stomach can be filled even for one rupee
 sawaal uthta he ki aap khaanaa kya chaahate hai
 This is called relevant question
 chhichhori public kii chakallas maansikta dekhie
 In the process of making a laugh, she could not even ask, Farukh sir, where is this one-rupee meal found
 kyonki iskaa jawaab gopneey nahin he
 Brother in heaven
 gar firdaus jameen ast, hameen ast, hameen ast
 In Kashmir, where else? Farooq's Sheikhchilli Kashmiris have become so accustomed to things that they don't even laugh
 hans bhi nahin sakate
 When the stomach is empty, it hurts more than laughing
 par vah bhi itane hanse kii unki ankhon main aansu aa gaye
 His bullet and army bullet, terrorists' bullet
 un becharon kaa pet bhar gaya he
 But what is the problem for the rest of the countrymen? What do they want? When the government has promised that 80 crore people will get food for free, should they also serve curry cooked in five-star hotel restaurants? Gandhiji was right
 duniya main sabaki jaruratein puraa karne kaa bhar he, magar laalach ye kisi kaa puraa nahin kar sakati
 Samosa sold on the roadside in a small town is also available for 10 rupees
 lekin jab muft main khaanaa mil rahaa he, to teen samose ghaposane kii jarurat kya he
 If you do not eat three samosas with sour and green chutney, then you will not die
 maranaa-maarna to mid de mile kaa kaam he
 If you earn 31 rupees a day
 to montek meter ke hisaab se aap pakke vaale garib hai
 If you earn even a rupee more than this, then you will fall into the Vijay Mallya category
 amir ho naa sake, garib bhi nahin ho paae
 Well, the story is that you have 31 rupees and you ate three samosas on the road
 to bachaa kya? ek rupaia
 How will you reach home now? Indira Gandhi free transport scheme will be brought by the next UPA government
 wo tab aegi jab aap vot denge raaj babbar, rashid masood or farrukh abdulla jaison ko
 The day will soon come when you have to decide whether to avail the free travel scheme after 3 samosas of 30 rupees
 tab tak ke liye samose rahane do, bas kii tikit kharid lo

 MGP leader Sudhir Dhavalikar had told media persons that he can only support the BJP to bring it to power if Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar is given the responsibility of the post of Chief Minister of Goa
 MGP ke 3 vidhayak chunakar aae hai
 Dhavalikar was talking to media persons in Goa

 Of these, BJP has fielded Prasad Gaonkar of Save Goa Front in the election and the BJP alliance's figure is reaching 20
 jabaki baaki bache 2 nirdaleeyon main se rohan khanvate par congress ne apana daanv lagaaya he
 Goa in-charge and senior Congress leader Digvijay Singh held a press conference and said that Rohan Khawante has met Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi and will be with Congress
 haalanki, rohan khanvate or ensipi ke 1-1 vidhayak ke samarthan ke baad bhi bijepi gathbandhan ke mukaable congress gathbandhan 1 vidhayak peeche he
 Manohar Parrikar, who is going to become CM under these circumstances, will have to be made a member of the Goa Legislative Assembly within 6 months
 jiske liye vartmaan vidhayak kaa istifa jaruri he
 In fact, earlier Goa Governor Mridula Sinha invited BJP leader and Union Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar to form the government
 parrikar ne ravivaar ko hi rajyapal se mulaakaat kar sarkaar banane kaa daawa pesh kiya tha
 The Governor has asked Parrikar to prove his majority within 15 days after his swearing in

 Union Minister Nitin Gadkari said that the MGP and the Goa Forward told him that if Manohar Parrikar became the Chief Minister, he was ready to give support
 maine party adhyaksh amit shah ke samaksh goa ke vidhayakon kii baat rakhi
 He held discussions with Prime Minister Modi and the Parliamentary Board
 is puure ghatnakram ko lekar parrikar ne kaha ki party jo bhi faisla karegi, vah unhen maanya hoga or agar goa main unki jarurat he to vah raksha mantri kaa pad chhod denge
 Gadkari said that the party president and the parliamentary board had given me the right to take appropriate decisions
 jab main 21 vidhayakon ke samarthan ke prati aashwast ho gaya tab rajyapal se mulaakaat kar sarkaar banane daawa pesh kiya gaya
 The decision to make Parrikar as Chief Minister was approved in the meeting of newly elected Goa mlas on Sunday evening
 parrikar ne rajyapal se mulaakaat kar goa main sarkaar banane kaa daawa bhi pesh kiya he
 Parrikar has claimed the support of 21 mlas
 vidhayakon ke samarthan kaa patr lekar kendriya parivahan mantri nitin gadakari ke saath parrikar rajbhavan pahunche
 Significantly, the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP), which was ready to support the BJP, had put a condition that if Manohar Parrikar will be made the Chief Minister of Goa, then only he will give support
 MGP ke netaa sudhir dhavlikar ne mediakarmiyon se baatcheet main kaha tha ki ve bijepi ko satta main laane ke liye tabhi samarthan de sakate hai jab rakshaamantri manohar parrikar ko goa ke mukhyamantri pad kii jimmedaari di jaae

 dhavlikar goa main mediakarmiyon se baat kar rahe the
 He made his point clear by writing a letter to BJP President Amit Shah

 In such a situation, denying the support of its old ally MGP would mean that the BJP gets away from the race for power
 dhavlikar ke manohar parrikar or bijepi se barkaraar rishton main khatas tab aayi jab lakshmikant parsekar ko goa kaa mukhyamantri banaaya gaya
 The MGP withdrew support to the BJP government after Parsekar's statement against MGP ministers
 iske baad MGP ne shivasena or goa suraksha manch ke saath gathjod kar bijepi ko chunauti di
 This alliance has won only 3 seats
 unke samarthan se bijepi 13 se 16 tak to pahunch jaaegi
 Apart from MGP, the Goa forward is also positive about Manohar Parrikar's leadership
 is gut ke paas bhi 3 vidhayakon kaa sankhyabal he
 Gut leader Vijay Sardesai told the media in Goa that Parrikar was a better person than the Congress
 congress ne goa forward ke ummidavaaron ko pratadit kiya he
 In such a situation, how will it be possible to support the Congress? With the support of Goa Forward too, BJP will get closer to majority and it can have the support of 19 mlas
 tippaniyan There are now 3 independent mlas in Goa
 inamen rohan khanvate, govind gaavade or prasad gaanvkar shaamil hai

 However, despite the support of Rohan Khawante and ncp's 1-1 MLA, the Congress alliance is lagging behind the MLA 1
 in paristhitiyon main siem banane ja rahe manohar parrikar ko 6 maheene ke bheetar goa vidhansabha kaa sadsy bananaa hoga
 For which the resignation of the current MLA is necessary
