 Final match of World Cup 2019
 jo ki taai hua or phir super over wo bhi taai ho gaya
 What could have been better for cricket fans
 lekin jo nateeja saamne aayaa, usne karodon phens kaa dil bhi tod diya or cricket sanstha ICC par sawaalon kii bauchhaar karne kaa mauka bhi de diya
 England won the World Cup but New Zealand could not digest the defeat
 boundry ke aadhaar par hue faisle par naa sirf cricket phens balki diggaj khilaadiyon ne bhi sawaal khadey kar die hai
 New Zealand veteran Scott Styris tweeted after the final match
 unhone likhaa ki bahut badhiya ICC, aap sirf ek mazaaq ho
 It is clear that he was not happy with the result
 iske alaava newjiland team ke purv captain stephen fleming ne bhi likhaa ki ye nirdayee tha
 Apart from these, former cricketer and BJP MP Gautam Gambhir also tweeted and targeted this rule of ICC
 gambhir ne is niyam ko bakawaas niyam qaraar diya
 Gautam Gambhir wrote that what kind of rule is this, where the World Champion is being decided on the basis of boundary
 ye match taai hona chahie tha
 Don't understand how the game of such proportions, the # cwc19final, is finally decided on who scored the most boundaries
 a ridiculous rule@icc
 Should have been a tie
 i want to congratulate both@blackcaps&@englandcricketon playing out a nail biting Final
 Both winners imo

 you are a joke! Raised questions
 logon ne twitor par likhaa ki jab 102 over ke match ke baad bhi faisla chauke-chakke ke aadhaar par hi faisla nikal rahaa he to phir ye kaisaa niyam he
 Is this a street cricket or a World Cup final
 Rules are made to improve the spirit of game, Not to let down, What's the meaning that the two team who hit more 4's would win a game
 It's WC final not a gully match
 Improve your rules@icc # iccrules— Rajarahul (@rajarahulsingh)july 15, 2019vahiin, kuch logon ne likhaa ki isisi kaa jaisaa niyam he, usase achche to gali cricket ke niyam hai
 People are taking about Stokes, Butler but English bowler made them champion if we consider # iccrules— Yogendra Singh (@ Yogendras02) July 15, 2019 The way the super over came after the final over did not result and there was no result
 
 to newjiland haar gaya, lekin logon ne kaha ki agar aisi sthiti ai to isisi ko sanyukt vijeta ghoshit karnaa chahie tha
 After Tie in main game
 
 and in Super Over
 There should have been joint winners
 @ BLACKCAPS # iccrules — Manish Veerkar (@manishveerkar) July 15, 2019 Fans wrote on Twitter that even after 48 matches and 46 days, the title decision is coming out on the basis of fours and sixes

 🏆— Syed Arsalan (@syedars33364238)july 14, 2019kya kahata he ICC kaa niyam?darasal, isisi ke niyam ke anusaar agar match taai hota he to uske liye super over khelaa jaataa he
 And if the super over also gets a tie that happened in the final
 to phir boundry ke aadhaar par faisla nikalataa he, yani jisaki boundry zyada vahi vijeta
 In this, along with the innings, boundaries of super overs are also counted
 isi aadhaar par ravivaar ko england vijeta bana
 New Zealand scored 241 runs batting first and England needed 242 runs to become World Champion
 lekin england bhi 50 over main 241 ran hi bana sakaa or match taai ho gaya
 This tie match resulted in a super over, in which England scored 15 runs and later New Zealand were also able to score only 15 runs
 isliye match yahaan bhi taai ho gaya
 When there was no result, the result of the match was based on 'whose boundary is more'
 or isi aadhaar par england worldcup jeet gaya
 England made a total of 26 boundaries in their innings and New Zealand a total of 17

 The case went to the Supreme Court which refused to intervene
 hai court ne bhi is par turant sunwaayee karne se inkaar kar diya
 Apparently supporters of this program now have fewer options
 uniwarsity ke kul 64 collejon main se 57 ne is course ko tilanjali dekar teen saal ke course par apni sahmati bhi jataa di he
 He has also informed the UGC in this regard
 pichley saal jab yah corse diu ke mutthi bhar prophessoron dwaara laayaa ja rahaa tha to uskaa kaaphi virodh hua tha
 But it enjoyed the support of the ruling Congress and despite protests, it was inflicted on the students
 kaha gaya ki aisa course america main prachlit he or isse chaatro ko phayda hoga
 But it was pointed out by the opponents of the course that the first year studies were largely childish
 diu koi maamuli uniwarsity nahin he or yahaan ke kai collejon main admician lene ke liye 90 pratishat ank bhi kam pad jate hai
 The most brilliant students of the country come here and it is ridiculous for them to arrange such studies
 lekin baat vahiin khatm nahin ho jaati
 It is utterly unfair to impose such a four-year course without making radical changes to the course, without experienced teachers and without everyone's consent
 bharat ke vishvavidhyalayon main swanatak course main kya padhaayaa jaataa he yah sabhi jaanate hai
 This study is not very difficult and no special skill is required for this
 phir iske liye chaar saal lagane kaa auchityakya he? agar padhai koi khaas kism kii ho yaa bilkul nai ho yaa phir use padhane vaale bilkul hi anaadi ho to phir course kii avadhi badhaaibhi jaani chahie
 To impose a four-year course in the name of better education is undoubtedly wrong
 lekin diu main aisa hi hua or ab iske khilaafajoardaar awaz uthte hi vahaan ke vaais chancelar dinesh singh raajnneeti par utar aae hai
 First came the news of resignation from his side and there was silence
 bhartiya shiksha pranali main dheron khamiyaan hai
 The standard of education has fallen here and the teacher is no less responsible for this
 is tarahake course lagu karke snaatak str kii shiksha kaa ve kya bhala karnaa chaahate hai
 If it is to be improved, it is first necessary to increase the hours of studies
 yah sabhi jaanate hai ki diu main ek saal main kitne dinon kii chhuttiyaan hoti hai or kitne dinon kii padhai
 If you want to improve, first reduce the number of holidays
 uske baad shikshakon ko rifressure course karwaanaa chahie thik vaise hi jaise jambo jet udaane valepayalton kii hoti he
 New topics and references should be inserted in the course
 bajaay vivaad karne ke sabaki koshish yah honi chahie ki iskaa sthanduniya ke 100 sarvshereshth vishvidhyalayon main ho
 Right now it is not even in the top 200
 is vivaad ko badhaane se acha he ki diu chaar saal ke is pachade se baahar ho jaae
 There was no shortage in the three-year course
 use phir se lagukarke aage kii badhiya yojana banaai jaae taaki yah duniya ke behtareen vishvidhyalayon main shumaar ho
 This is not going to happen with the course of four years
 is samay desh ke kone-kone se aae hue hajaaron chaatr admician kaa intazaar shuru hone kaa besabri se intazaar kar rahe hai
 Admission should be started instead of disappointing them

 The White House suspended (temporarily invalidated) the press pass of cnn's White House correspondent Jim Acosta
 vahiin, gym kaa bachaav karte hue sienen ne kaha ki yah faisla 'loktantr ke liye khatra' he
 The crackdown came a day after a heated confrontation between President Donald Trump and CNN chief White House Correspondent Jim Acosta during a press conference on Wednesday
 white house ne acosta ke bartaav ko 'ghinauna or acroshit karne vaala' qaraar diya
 The White House took this step following the tussle between Acosta and Trump
 donon ke bich kahasuni us vakt hui jab sienen samvaadadaata ne baith jane ke raashtrapati ke nirdesh ko nahin mana or america seemaa kii taraf bad rahe madhya america pravaasiyon ke kaaravaan par unki raay jaanane ke liye lagaataar sawaal karte rahe
 Then, looking extremely angry, Trump said, 'enough is enough
 'iske baad white house kii ek intern ne sienen ke patrkaar ke haath se mike lene kii naakaam koshish kii
 Describing Acosta's behavior as "disgusting and outrageous", White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement on Wednesday, "as a result of today's incident, the White House, the relevant reporter's hard pass until the next order Suspends for 'sara ne kaha ki trump aaazaad press main yakeen karte hai or apane evam apane prashasan ke bare main mushkil sawaalon kii apeksha karte hai
 He said, 'however, we will never tolerate that a reporter put his hand on a young woman working as an intern in the White House
 yah bartaav puri tarah asweekaarya he
 'sara said,' It is also a complete disrespect to the reporter's colleagues that they do not get a chance to ask questions
 'unhone daawa kiya ki trump ne press ko pehle ke kisi bhi raashtrapati ke kaarykaal kii tulana main kahin zyada aazaadee di he
 The White House press secretary said, "contrary to cnn's arguments, the president's support for the Azad press will be nothing more than a show to date
" kareeb dedh ghante main 35 alag-alag reportron se 68 sawaal lene ke bich, aaazaad press kaa samarthan nahin karne kii baat kahkar ve raashtrapati par hamale bolenge
 Many of these questions were also from the said reporter
 'is bich, sienen ne kaha, 'aaj kii press conference main chunauteepurn sawaal poochne ke kaaran badale kii karrwai karte hue
 Acosta's pass suspended
 yah abhootpurv faisla hamaare loktantr ke liye khatra he or desh isse behatar ke kaabil he
 'around seven o'clock in the evening, Acosta was prevented by Secret Service officials from entering the White House
 white house samvaadadaata sanghathan ke purv adhyaksh jeff mason ne white house ke is aarope ko khaarij kiya ki acosta ne mahila intern par apana haath rakhaa tha
 Maison tweeted, 'I was sitting next to Acosta at today's press conference and did not see him laying his hands on the young intern
 'news agency royatres ke samvaadadaata mason ne sienen samvaadadaata acosta kaa bachaav karte hue kaha ki intern ke aane tak acosta ne mike pakad kar rakhaa or baad main apni baat sabit karne ke liye press conference kii kuch tasviren daaleen
 Peter Baker, a New York Times journalist who has been covering the White House for the past 22 years, said, "this is something i haven't seen since i started covering the White House in 1996
 duusare raashtrapatiyon ko mushkil sawaalon se dar nahin lagata tha
 The White House Correspondents Organization also said that such a decision is 'unacceptable'
 sanghathan ne white house se 'apana faisla tunrat waapas lene' kii apil kii
 The president of the organization, Olivier Knox, said, "journalists can do many things to do their job, and the White House correspondent organization does not control the tone of its members when it comes to questioning powerful government top officials, including the president
 'is bich, white house ne kaha ki vah apane faisle par kaayam he
 Sara shared a video saying, 'we stand by our decision to suspend this person's hard pass
 ham is video main saaf taur par najar aa rahe anuchit vyavhaar ko bardaasht nahin karenge

 input :IANS Ministry of Railways has released the draft of the new catering policy
 jari kiye gaye draft ke mutabik railway nai cataring policy main iarsitisi ko ek badi jimmedaari dene ja rahaa he
 In the new policy, all zonal railways contracts for pantry car service will be given to IRCTC
 short notice par shuru kii gai sabhi nai trainon main cataring sarvice ke prabandhan kaa jimmaa bhi iarsitisi ko hi diya jayega
 It is noteworthy that the catering policy implemented at this time was implemented in the year 2010
 aisa mana ja rahaa he kii pichhali sarkaron ne IRCTC ko darkinar karte hue manamaane dhang se privet companiyon ko railway ke khanpan kii zyaadaatar services de di thi
 The consequence of this was that private companies made huge profits, but Becharelarayatrighatiya continued to be upset by having food
 baar-baar aa rahi shikayaton ke maddenjar rail mantri suresh prabhu ne bajet main is baat kii ghoshnaa kii thi ki vah jald nai cataring policy laaenge
 In order to fulfill its promise, Railway Minister Prabhu has put the draft of the new catering policy of 2016 for discussion after all the discussions
 nai policy main jahaan ek taraf iarsitisi ko sabhi trainon main cataring kaa jimmaa saunpane kii taiyaari he to vahiin duusari taraf platform or railway stesan par uchit quality kaa swaadisht khaanaa mili isaki bhi guarantee di ja rahi he
 While the Railways has talked about promoting e-catering on the one hand, on the other hand, steps have also been taken to improve on board services in trains
 khaanaa umdaa mili or isaki quality main koi samjhauta naa ho iske liye sabhi chalati-phirti sevaaon ke lieiarsitisiapani kichan se hi khaanaa uthaaegi
 All base kitchens of Railways will be handed over to IRCTC
 iske alaava iarsitisi ko yah adhikaar dene kii taiyaari he ki yah hospitality udyog kii badi companiyon ko bhi sarvice dene ke liye anubandhit kare
 The four base kitchens under Zonal Railways, Nagpur, CST Mumbai, BCT Mumbai and Ballarshah will be handed over to IRCTC
 iske alaava jan aahaar or railway steshnon par maujuud duusari kichan ko bhi iarsitisi ko dene kii taiyaari he
 The biggest thinking that is being said behind this is that by doing this, the quality of food will be improved
 cataring sarvice ke management ke liye bhartiya railway or iarsitisi ke bich nayaa memorondom of anderstending sin kiya jayega
 The appropriate way pantrycar for mobile catering service will be designed and the equipment of state of art technology will be included in the catering along with it
 iske alaava railway ne ek doosraa bada faisla lene kaa nirnay liya he
 Under this, the gas stove will be gradually eliminated on the platform in catering and in the running train and instead of them, electric appliances will be preferred
 isi ke saath nai draft cataring policy main sabhi shatabdi aurajanshatabdi trainonya aisi hi duusari trainon main modern gagetts se susajjit mini pentry lagane kii baat kahi gai he
 All these trains are prepared to serve food to people through trolleys
 iarsitisi jahaan ek taraf saunpi gai cataring ikaayiyon kii jimmedaari uthaaegi vahiin duusari taraf food plaza food court or fast food unit ke kaamkaaj ko bhi sanbhaalegi
 According to the draft new catering policy, cooking should not be done at the suburban station and other railway stations
 iske liye kooking stalls or troliyon main platform ke upar kooking ke kaam ko dhire-dhire khatm kiye jane par jor diya ja rahaa he
 Railways will gradually try to provide ready-made food on all platforms
 rail mantralay ne agle kuch saalon main railway steshnon par automatic self vending mashiinon ko badhaava dene kii vakaalat kii he
 The District Magistrates believe that while on one hand the best system will be built at the railway stations, on the other hand, the dirt will get rid of
 isi ke saath jonal railway ko is baat kii manaahi kii gai he ki vah kisi nae khomache, daliya, haath thela or chaay ke baaltee ke liye koi nayaa license nahin jari karegaa
 Amidst all this, in the draft policy of railway catering, it has also been decided to give 33 per cent sub quota in all reserved categories for small catering units at railway stations

 aam chunaav kii tazaa khabaron se apadet rahane ke liesbscribakaren ajtak kaa ellection special newzlator Four youths forcibly took a young woman into the forest in Shahbad area of UP Rampur and carried out the sensational crime of gang rape with her there
 peedita pashuon ke liye chaara lene gai thi
 On the complaint of his family, the police have registered a case against the four youths
 unki talash kii ja rahi he
 According to the information, the victim had gone out of the village to get fodder for the animals
 use akelaa paakar ilaake ke chaar yuvakon ne do bike se use agava kar liya
 He took him to a forest, where the four ganged with him
 isi bich kuch logon ko udhar aata dekh chaaron aaropee vahaan se faraar ho gaye
 The villagers somehow brought the young woman to her house in a bad condition
 usne apni aapbeetee parijanon ko bataai, to unke hosh ud gaye
 After this, the family named Tahrir against the four accused, Siyaram leader, Noora, Kanhaiya and Salman in the police station Shahabad
 iske baad police ne chaaron ke khilaaf cese darj kar liya
 Police said that a case has been registered under section 376 of the IPC against the accused on the victim's family

 Superintendent of Police Sanjeev Tyagi said that the police team is scouting for the accused
 maldive ke gharelu sankat ne bharat main itani halchal na paidaa kii hoti, agar usne chini nausainya takat ko bhartiya prayadweep ke dakshin main sthit is khadbadate dweep par apane paanv jamaane ke liye daravaaje na khole hote
 Political, security and economic contacts with India have steadily decreased since President Abdulla Yameen's power in Malé illegally removed Nasheed through a coup coup in 2012
 duusari taraf, isane apane yahaan teji se chini upasthiti ko vistaar diya he
 It started in 2013 with the cancellation of the contract of GMR for the Indian airport by the Indian company and soon the government gave the contract to a Chinese company
 july 2015 main maldive ke sampatti kanoon ko badalakar jameen ke videshi swaamitv kii ijaajat di gai
 On condition that at least one billion dollars are invested and 70 percent of the land is acquired from the sea
 china ko dakshin china sagar main samudr kii chodi hui jameen par is tarah ke dweepiya nirmaan kaa acha-khaasaa tajurba he, isliye isamen koi atkal lagane kii jarurat nahin thi ki is nae kanoon kaa phayda kisko milane vaala he
 During a visit to Beijing in November 2017, Yameen signed a free trade agreement with China and within a short time accepted it
 ab uttari ihavandhippolu dweep par china or saudi niveshak mahatvakankshi ihavan project kaa vikaas kar rahe hai
 The island is not far from India
 is project main ek aadhunik bandargah, ek airport, ek krooj hub, ek marina or ek godi hoga
 There are also reports that China may build another port in the southern Lamu atoll, with the ultimate objective of turning it into a high-level resort for Chinese tourists
 ab maldive main aane vaale videshi paryatakon kaa sabase bada hissaa china kaa hi hota he
 China has just started its embassy in Male in 2011, its progress is truly remarkable
 china ne lagaataar yah daawa kiya he ki maldive main sainya adda banane kaa uskaa koi iraadaa nahin
 But in August 2017, it made clear its intention to land three naval ships in the Indian Ocean in Male for the first time that it would maintain its naval presence in this sea area
 ye jahaaj usne chhip-chhipaakar nahin balki saarvajanik rup se utaare the
 Hence the message is clear and clear: China is gearing up to reinforce its repeated claims that the Indian Ocean is not an Indian Ocean
 yamin vah madhyam banakar hi khush hai jiske jariye bharat tak sandesh pahunche
 In the same manner as Rajapaksa had done in Sri Lanka earlier, in the development of the port of Hambantota in the southern part of the country, keeping his country completely mortgaged to China
 tark diya jaataa he ki srilanka or maldive main chini nivesh ke peeche kaarobaari makasad he or ek vajah haal kii mahatvakankshi belt road pariyojna bhi he
 But the fact is that the cost of these huge projects is beyond the financial capacity of both countries and hence it is expected to eventually fall into their debt trap
 isse is baat kaa jokhim bad jaataa he ki china apane bhu-rajnatik iraadon ko puraa karne vaali maangen shuru kar de, jaisaa ki hamane hambantota main dekha he
 Maldives are more likely to get caught in such a trap
 yahaan gauratlab he ki chini nausena ke samrikavidon ne kai baar apane iraade saaf kiye hai
 a few years ago, a Chinese Navy magazine explained China's Indian Ocean strategy in this way: "choose locations carefully, deploy carefully, prioritize cooperative activities, try to penetrate slowly
" ''hind mahaasaagar main chini gatividhiyaan bilkul isi kaa paalan kar rahi hai
 On the other hand, India's attitude towards maritime security is quite the opposite
 maldive ke haalia ghatnakram or anya samrik rup se mahatvapurn deshon ke bare main apni pratikriya dene se pehle hamen bhu-rajnatik tasviir ko jarur dhyaan main rakhana chahie
 What is happening in the Maldives is important for India — not only because of the right and wrong decisions that Yameen has made there, but also because of the credibility of our country's maritime strategy to remain in power What can be the effect? maldive kii haalia ghatnaon ko dekhne kaa ek or tarika yah ho saktaa haih akalan karnaa ki ve khaskar suraksha vaale samvedansheel kshetra main hamaare asar ko agar badhane nahin de sakate to kam se kam uske ksharan ko rokane kaa avasar pradaan karte hai yaa nahin
 In 2012, India took a wrong decision
 hamane vahaan ke tatkaaleen raashtrapati nashid ke hastkshep karne ke aahvaan par sunwaayee nahin kii, jab unhen istipha dene ke liye majaboor kiya ja rahaa tha or iske baad yamin ke liye satta par kabja karne kaa rasta aasaan ho gaya
 Nasheed was the constitutionally elected head of state and Indian intervention to prevent the coup against him was justified
 aise kai avasar aae hai jab jokhim ke baavjood bhartiya hiton ko bachaane ke liye twarit karrwai kii jarurat thi
 Look and wait policy many times mercilessly hurts our interests
 ab sawaal uthta he ki na sirf srilanka or maldive, balki seychelles or morishas jaise dweep deshon main apane paanv jamaana china ke liye kyon mahatvapurn he? pehle hamane jis chini patrika kaa ullekh kiya he, usee main yah sweekaar kiya gaya tha ki bharat kii ore se hind mahaasaagar or pashchimi prashanth mahaasaagar ke bich mahatvapurn samudri margon ke prasar se china ko bharat ke ankush yaa bharat kii sakriyata kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he or isamen use america, japan jaisi mahashaktiyon kii madad mil sakati he
 Establishing a series of naval bases along the Indian peninsula or at least developing naval supplies and dock facilities could be an effective strategy for China
 to isaki barabari main bharat ke liye vishwasaneey ranneeti kya ho sakati he? aisi ranneeti is suspasht sachaai ko sweekaar karke banaai jaani chahie ki china or bharat ke bich baari aarthik or sainya antar he
 There may be two policy suggestions in this regard
 pehla, kam mahatvapurn kshetron se sansadhano ko hataakar tatkaal is upmahadweep ke paridhi vaale ilaakon main lagaaya jaae taaki hamaare nazariye se samoochee sthiti main hui kshati kii bharpai kii ja sake
 Instead of scattered resources over a large geographical area, it would be more important to re-emphasize immediate neighbors
 doosraa, hind mahaasaagar main china kii dhamak badhane se na sirf bhartiya hiton ko khatra pahunch rahaa he, balki america, japan or australia jaise diggaj deshon ke hiton ko bhi
 This would have an impact on the US fleet in Diego Garcia and also on the Japanese commitment to the indo-pacific region, which also includes Australia's interest
 ye sabhi desh nae sire se ban rahe chaturbhuj kaa hissaa hai, haalanki abhi bhi unamem ise lekar hichkichaahat he
 There is an urgent need to determine the credible role of this quadrant to prevent China's unilateral interference in the Indian Ocean
 hamaare bilkul pados ke deshon main chini gatividhiyon kii vajah se bharat kii samrik jagah simat rahi he
 We have to understand its implausible implications and take the right steps, before the ground conditions here change in the same way as has happened in the South China Sea
 dirghakaalik lihaaj se bharat ko apni aarthik or sainya kshamtaaon ko zyada teji se badhanaa hoga, taaki china ke saath takat kii jo khai he, use kam kiya ja sake
 Only this can expand the strategic options available to us
 in kshamtaaon ko badhaane main zyada praathamikta samudri kshamta badhaane ko deni hogi
 At present, the Navy gets only 17 percent of the total defense budget, but by 2030 it will have to be increased to 30 percent
 hind mahaasaagar main hamaari saamudrik badhat ko banaae rakhane ke liye yah aprihaary he, jisamen ki chini nausena ke vistaar kii vajah se teji se ksharan ho rahaa he
 Former Foreign Secretary Shyam Saran is a Senior Fellow at the Center for Policy Research, Delhi *** prakaash jha ne apni film 'satyagrah' ke liye amrutha raav ko chunaa he
 Rowe is very happy that most of his scenes are not with anyone else but with Amitabh Bachchan

 Amrita Rao told, 'we are shooting in Bhopal

 To be honest, 99 percent of the scene is with him

 His role in 'satyagraha' could prove to be a turning point for his career
 lekin vah iske bare main kuch bhi khulaasa nahin karnaa chaahatin

 We have been shooting here for ten days
 yahaan abhi 55 dinon se zyada shooting chalegi
 Significantly, 'satyagraha' also stars Kareena Kapoor in addition to actors like Ajay Devgan, Arjun Rampal and Manoj Vajpayee
 dilli pradesh congress ke adhyaksh ajay maakan ne dilli sarkaar, dilli kii teenon emsidi, endiemasi or dilli police ke upar rehadi patari waalon ko pareshaan karne kaa aarope lagaaya he
 According to Maken, on October 13, the Congress will give a big demonstration in support of street vendors
 khadaa ho gaya he aajeevika kaa sankatmakanane aarope lagayaa ki pichley kuch dinon main rehadi patari waalon par bevajaah karrwai kii ja rahi he
 According to Maken, during the last one week, about 10 thousand street tracks have been removed, which has created a livelihood crisis in front of a large number of street vendors
 tyoharon ke vakt ho rahi karrwai se ye log tyohaar bhi nahin manaa paa rahe hai
 Do not remove the street tracks without giving an alternative
 The Congress said that Congress had prepared a 'road Track Livelihood Protection Bill' in 2013 for the street vendors and in 2014, made it legal as well
 maakan ne bataaya ki usamen saaf taur par is baat kaa zikr kiya gaya tha ki bina vikalp die rehadi patari waalon ko nahin hataaya jayega
 Delhi High Court itself has ordered the agencies to remove them within the legal limits, but in spite of this the agencies are trying to destroy them
 13 oktober ko bada virodh pradarshancongresane kaha he ki rehadi patari waalon ke saath ho rahe atyaachaar par congress 13 oktober ko bada virodh pradarshan karegi
 Ajay Maken said that on October 13, the Congress would hold demonstrations on all 12 zones of the three mcds in Delhi and oppose the action being taken with the street vendors

 To prevent the misuse of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes Act-1989, the Supreme Court has issued a new guideline in a Maharashtra case, ruling in a case
 iske tahat exiaar darj hone ke baad aaropee kii tatkaal giraftaar nahin hogi
 The DSP level officer will investigate the allegations first
 yadi aarope sahi paae jate hai tabhi aage kii karrwai hogi
 a bench of Supreme Court Justices AK Goel and UU Lalit issued the guidelines stating that Parliament should not have come to the idea while enacting this law that the Act could also be misused
 deshbhar main aise kai maamle saamne aae hai, jisamen is adhinium kaa durupyog hua he
 Government employees have also been placed under the new guideline
 yadi koi sarkari karmchaaree adhinium kaa durupyog karata he to uski giraftaar ke liye vibhageeya adhikari kii anumati jaruri hogi
 If an officer violates this guideline, he will also have to face departmental action along with contempt of court
 vahiin, aam aadmi kii giraftaar jile ke varisht police adheekshak (esaspi) kii likhit anumati ke baad hi hogi
 Apart from this, the bench has also asked the magistrates of all the lower courts of the country to adopt the guidelines
 isamen essi / asti act ke tahat aaropee kii agrim jamaanat par magistrate vichaar karenge or apane vivek se jamaanat manjuur or naamanzoor karenge
 In the SC / ST Act till now, it used to be that if someone abuses by saying caste-related words, then immediately a case could be arrested and arrested
 in maamalon kii jaanch ab tak inspector rank ke police adhikari hi karte the, lekin ab jaanch varisht police adheekshak (esaspi) ke tahat hogi
 The court did not grant anticipatory bail in such cases

 But now the court will take a decision only after hearing it

 unhone kaha ki mukhyamantri ko bataanaa chahie ki aakhir rakesh singh unki party kaa prakhand adhyaksh kaise bana tha? sirf karrwai se kaam nahin chalegaa
 It is known that Rakesh Singh is accused of poisonous liquor

 JDU responded by saying that they took action as soon as they got the information, but the MLA Rajaballabh Yadav had come to meet RJD president Lalu Prasad Yadav, accused of rape, why did he not remove him from the party?

 On the other hand, Tejashwi Yadav said that did Lalu Prasad Yadav ever hide that he did not meet Rajaballabh Yadav? Shahabuddin did not talk to him from jail? He is in the party and the law is doing its work, he will suffer whatever punishment is given

 sahitya ajtak ke manch par bollywood ko li se hatakar filmein dene vaale film diarector anuraag kashyap ne shirkat kii
 Anurag Kashyap gave many interesting ideas related to his experience on cinema and literature in the festival session 'naya Cinema Nai Zuban'
 apane filmameking kariyar kii shuruyaat ke dinon ko yaad karte hue anuraag kashyap ne kaha ki shuruaati daur main film banane ko lekar unamem kaaphi bachapanaa tha
 Learn his 10 special things in literature Aaj Tak 
 
 1
 When Anurag first wrote poetry, he was in school and the school refused to print his poem in the magazine
 2
 Anurag told that we have grown up in such an environment where if any question is asked about sex or religion, then there was scolding that where did you hear and where are you learning all this
 mujhe bhi aisa hi maahaul mila
 3
 anuraag kashyap ne kahalogon ne sahityapadhana band kar diya he
 4
 maujuuda daur main cinema ne sahitya kii jagah le lee he lekinfilmon main sahityato sirf 10 percent hi najar aata he baaki to mastaram he

 anuraag bol 'ugly' jaisi film banane kaa uddeshy uskaa ant hi tha

 film banaakar main koi sandesh nahin dena chahta, main bas sawaal poochna chahta hum
 7
 main kashinath ko bahut bada sahityakar maanata hum or aise bhi bahut bade sahityakar hai jo chhapate hi nahin hai
 Every person has his own way of telling his own talk
 Even a stand-up comedian has a literature of what he speaks, i consider him a litterateur too
 8
 Since childhood, Anurag has been fond of telling similar things and ideas that no one wants to talk about
 9
 i believe that makes you think, Son Na De is the same literature and it is the same cinema
 ham hameshaa bhaand nahin ho sakate ki har vakt bas anterten hi karte rahen
 10
 anuraag ne kaha ki mujhe nahin pataa tha ki 'daaud ibrahim' ko film main daaud ibrahim nahin bol sakate, 'shivasena' ko shivasena nahin bol sakate the
 All i know is that i have to say the same thing about my mind

 Other things including Narendra Modi's claim about this were also discussed

 The bill to declare triple talaq and punish the sentence was passed in the Lok Sabha on Thursday after a long debate of about six hours
 bill kaa naam ‘da muslim vimen protection of ritis in marij act' he
 Triple divorce has now been made a punishable offense under this bill without any amendment
 rajyasabha main paarit hone or raashtrapati kii manjuuri ke baad ye kanoon kaa shakl akhriyaar kar legaa
 In such a situation, everyone is interested in what the effect will be
 muslim mahilaon ko ab agar koi teen talaak detaa he, to kya vikalp honge or unke liye isse kya kuch badalegaa
 What will change? After the anti-triple talaq law comes into force, if a husband gives his wife three divorces at a time, the wife will be able to go to the law and fight the fight for justice
 ye kanoon muslim mahilaon ko vaidhanik takat degaa
 The three divorces will give the aggrieved woman the strength to go to the magistrate
 isse mahila apane saath hue anyaay ke khilaaf kanoonee ladaai lard sakegi or apane haq ko hasil kar paaegi
 After this bill, giving three divorces will be considered a crime
 teen talaak virdohi kanoon kaa laabh desh ke muslim mahilaon ko milegaa
 8 according to the 2011 census
 4 karod muslim mahilaayein hai, jinhen iskaa laabh milegaa
 Provision in the Bill, a person commits three divorces at a time to his wife whether by speaking, writing or through mobile, computer in the form of whatsapp, Facebook, mail etc
, it will be considered illegal
 ek saath teen talaak dene vaale ko ek saal se teen saal kii sajaa or jurmaana ho saktaa he
 For this, the wife has to prove in court that her husband has given her three divorces at a time
 teen talaak peedit patni or bacchon ke jivan yaapan ke liye guzaara bhatta milegaa
 The wife is also entitled to the custody of minor children
 vidheyak par sawaal or aapattiyaan-pati jail main hoga to patni or bacchon kaa kharch koun degaa-jab teen talaak avaidh he to sajaa kyon or kisi-kisi tisare kii shikaayat par cese kaise-sharia ke khilaaf he teen talaak bilaakadon se samajhe samasyasupremecourt ne 22 agast 2017 ko teen talaak ko avaidh qaraar diya tha
 After this, it was believed that three divorces would be stopped, but this could not happen

 UP has the highest number of cases

 nepal main ravivaar ko jhalnath khanal ke nae pradhanmantri ke rup main shapath lene ke saath hi pichley saat maheenon se jari raajnneetik riktata to samaapt ho gai lekin iske saath hi nae vivaad ne janm le liya
 Even the swearing-in ceremony was a disservice to one's own party, resentment among former allies and controversy over power-sharing
 khanal ne apni sattadhari sahyogi party, nepali congress se naata todakar vipakshi maovadiyon ke saath ek samjhauta kiya or is tarah vah nepal ke 34wein pradhanmantri ban gaye
 But now he is facing difficulties with his new colleagues
 yah mushkil us samay pratyaksh rup se saamne aa gai, jab unhone maovadiyon ke saath satta bantwaare kii baatcheet vifal rahane ke baad akele shapath grahan kiya
 President Ram Baran Yadav administered him the oath of office and secrecy
 yadhyapi khanal ne kaha ki vah sakasham mantriyon vaali ek choti cabinet ke saath tatkaal kaam shuru kar denge, lekin maovadiyon ke kade virodh ke kaaran vah apni cabinet kii bhi ghoshnaa nahin kar paae hai
 That proposal of Khanal's party was rejected by Maoist chief Pushp Kamal Dahal Prachanda, which included keeping key ministries like home and finance
 gyaat ho ki khanal kii jeet sunishchit karaane ke liye prachand ne guuruuvaar ke chunaav main achaanak apni ummidavaari waapas le lee thi
 The Maoists are now seeking proportional representation in the cabinet, being the largest party in Parliament and linking 237 mps with Khanal's 109 mps
 is maang kaa sidhaa arth yah hota he ki 40 pratishat mantralay maovadiyon ke paas honge
 Apart from striking a tough balance with the Maoists, Khanal has created a crisis in his own party and with the Nepali Congress
 shapath grahan ke maukey par ek sharmnaak khulaase main yah baat ujagar hui ki khanal ne maovadiyon kaa samarthan hasil karne ke liye prachand ke saath ek gopneey samjhauta kiya
 In a confidential settlement, Khanal has agreed to take up the People's Liberation Army (PLA) of the Maoists, or to form a new security force with the same number of plas and government security forces
 vah baari-baari se pradhanmantri pad par kabiz hone kii vyavastha ke saath sarkaar chalaane par bhi raji hue hai
 Both these conditions have been strongly opposed by dissidents of the Nepali Congress and his party
 virodhiyon kaa kahana he ki yah samjhauta 2006 ke shanti samjhaute kaa ulanghan hoga
 The agreement is also to be opposed by the army

 25 years ago, the system was changed to neutral umpire in Test cricket
 yani jin do deshon main test match ho rahaa he, unki jagah duusare deshon ke tatasth ampiron ko match kii nigaraanee kaa jimmaa diya gaya
 Actually, this system was brought in because at that time there were many complaints of partiality in the decisions of domestic umpires
 lekin haal main edbeston main england or australia ke bich ashes siries ke pehle test main ampire joel wilson or aleem daar kaa kharaab pradarshan charchaa main rahaa
 This again fueled the debate as to whether we have the best umpires in Test matches? Talking to Mike Gatting, chairman of the World Cricket Committee at MCC, he is more keen on removing the mandatory system of neutral umpires
 Don't come unka kahana he ki kya aap sabhi test maichon main duniya ke sarvshereshth ampire chaahate hai? ye tab tak mushkil he jab tak aapke paas vastav main majboot panel nahin hoga
 What is Mike Gating's opinion? Mike Gating says, "england and Australia have 7 elite umpires but you can't stand them in the Ashes
" agar aapke paas shreshth ampire hai to kya aap unhen istemaal karne main samarth ho paa rahe hai? aapako hona chahie
 So now we are having this debate
 main samajhataa hum ki ab ampiron ko tivi par apni galtiyaan dekhne ke liye takanic or upkaran maujuud hai
 This gives them ample scope to improve their performance
 wo practice kar sakate hai, dobaaraa soch-samaj sakate hai ki kyon unhone kiya, kya unhone kiya?'vakt vakt par aisi baaten saamne aati rahati hai ki achche ampiron par tatasthta ke liye bharosa kiya jaae
 When the Ashes test series does not stand up to a high profile like Simon Taufel and David Shepherd, there are suggestions that only the best umpires should be given an opportunity, even if the teams in their country are playing
 haalia edbeston test kii baat kii jaae to kul 20 faislon kii samiksha kii gai
 This was a particularly poor performance for Umpire Wilson
 aise main neutral ampiron kii vyavastha par phir sawaal uthne shuru ho gaye
 What does Ricky Ponting say? Former Australia captain Ricky Ponting is very vocal in this matter
 ponting ne cricket austrailia kii website se kaha, “log kah sakate hai ki jaisi takanic ab hamaare paas he, ye adhik myne nahin rakhata
 But this is not a good sight when clearly visible wrong decisions are made
 shreshth ampire sabhi bade toornament se baahar dikhaai de sakate hai
 This may force them to retire early
 ”bataa den ki mike gaiting khud bhi 1987 main pakistan ke daure par faisalabad test main kharaab faisle par ampire shakur rana ke saath tikhi takaraar main uljhe the
 This incident was in the news
 gaiting us vaakye ko yaad kar neutral ampire rakhane ke phaayde ko nuksaan se zyada baari maanate hai
 Gatting says, "we have some great umpires
 afsos kii baat he ki us shaks (ampire wilson) ke liye aakhri test match bahut bura game rahaa
 Or rather let it be so for both (wilson and Aleem Dar)
 ampiring kii teaching ab kaaphi adhik he
 Tools are getting better
 jab aap bich main hote hai, agar aapane game khelaa he, to aap bahut shor ke bich bhi bat pad kii baariki ko samaj sakate hai
 Sometimes it's more difficult if you haven't played the game
 dekhie, log galati karte hai or log behatar ho sakate hai
 Tools exist to improve them
 mujhe lagata he ki ham philhal surakshit jameen par hai

 He said, "the present government has certainly shown great political resolve in allowing surgical strikes and air strikes in Balakot across the border
 lekin isse pehle bhi aapaki sena ke haath nahin bandhe the
 "he said," There has been much talk about giving the army an open exemption, but since 1947 the army has been independent on the border
 isane teen-chaar yuddh lade hai
 "the Line of Control is a dangerous place," Hooda said, because as i said, you are being fired and the soldiers on the ground will respond immediately
 ve (sainik) mujhase bhi nahin puuchhenge
 There is no question of taking any permission
 sena ko khuli chhot di gai he or yah sab saath main hua he, koi vikalp nahin he
 "hooda led the Army's Northern Command during a cross-border surgical strike following the Uri terror attack in September 2016

 He said, 'please trust your senior military officers
 sainya abhiyaanon ke mahanideshak jab khule taur par yah kehete hai ki unhone sargical strike kiya to jaahir taur par isamen shaq karne jaisaa koi kaaran nahin he 
 The retired lieutenant general said that the armed forces have not seen any kind of political intervention in any government's time
 ‘‘sainya maamalon main dakhal rakhane vaale ke taur par main puri tarah nishpakshta or eemaandaaree se kah saktaa hum ki sainya abhiyaan kis tarah chalaae jaaen is bare main kabhi raajnneetik netaaon ne zyada dakhlandaji nahin kii

 Hooda is now heading the Congress workforce on national security
 hooda ne uri aatanki hamale ko yaad karte hue kaha, ‘‘us shaam, main chif of army staff ke saath tha
 And we went through a four inch thick layer of ash of tents saying that we have to do something, we cannot let it go like that
 '' unhone kaha, ‘‘jab ham vikalpon ke bare main baat kar rahe the, tab hamen is baat ne madad kii ki pichley ek saal se ham aisi kisi aakasmik sthiti ke liye prashikshan main jute the
 We did not know when this opportunity would come
 ''unhone kaha, ‘‘(uri hamale se pehle) pichley ek saal se special forcej ko iske liye taiyaar kiya ja rahaa tha
 
 
 What do we have to do if we want to attack across the border in Pakistan? ''hooda ne kaha, ‘‘ jab ham sainikon ko seemaa paar jate hue or aatankwaadiyon ko nishaanaa banaakar waapas lautate hue dekhte hai to iskaa matlab yah he ki unhone apane puure jivan main sirf kaam, kaam or kaam kiya he
 In the army, we say that the more you sweat during peacetime, the less your blood will flow during the war
 '' hooda ne kaha, ‘hamane seemaa paar paanch aatanki shiviron ko nishaanaa banane kaa faisla kiya
 This was a very complicated campaign
 yah duniya kii sabase zyada chaak chauband seemaa he
 We decided to go beyond it, where there are camps of terrorists
 hamane unhen nishaanaa banane or waapas aane kaa nirnay liya
 He said that the army was very 'confident' as the security forces had received excellent training
 hooda ne kaha, ‘‘ or sach kahuun to maine salaah par kaaphi bharosa kiya
 You are the only one to take decisions at the top level and if you refrain from taking advice, then you may take wrong decisions
 '' unhone kaha, ‘‘ hamen alag-alag samay par nishaanaa lagaana tha
 "on the night of 27 September (two days before the surgical strike), we got information that one of these terror camps was strengthened and activated," Hooda said
 ham yah soch rahe the ki hamen ise nishane vaali suchi main rakhana chahie yaa nahin
 "he said," After this we decided to send a small team of four to five people and focus on our target
 hamane khatre uthaane kaa faisla kiya kyonki yah jaruri tha
 These were the people who showed us the way the next day

 The students are demanding a change in the exam pattern (syllabus and format) of Union Public Service Commission (UPSC)
 darasal, prashasnic sevaaon ke liye upiessi dwaara yojit parikshaayen teen charnon main lee jaati he
 In the first phase, preliminary examination is done, in the second the main examination and in the end the candidates are interviewed
 si-sat kaa pehla prarupasi-sat se pehle ke praaroop ke anusaar iske do paper hote the
 The first part was optional in which students used to take the exam by choosing the subject of their choice while the second part was general studies
 donon kaa yoga karke hi total nikaala jaataa tha
 Students of Indian languages used to get benefit in this
 kya he si-sat?darasal, upiessi ne 2011 main praarambhik pariksha main si-sat yani kaaman civil services aptitude test ko shaamil kiya
 The inclusion of this is General Studies of 400 marks and C-SAT of 200 marks
 hindi madhyam ke chaatr angreji comprihension ke sawaalon main funs jate hai kyonki in sawaalon kaa hindi anuwaad kaaphi jatil rahata he
 Due to a lot of time spent understanding this, students of Hindi medium fall behind
 si-sat ke lagu hone ke baad bhi do hi paper hote hai lekin pehla bhaag opshanal nahin rahaa
 Now, in addition to the latest developments, history, geography, economics, science, many other subjects have also been included
 duusare shabdon main kahen to pehla part karant afares or rijning aadhaarit ho gaya he
 While in the second part English comprehension, communication skills, logical reasoning, analytical ability, decision making (decision making and problem-solving), general mental ability (general mental ability), Many topics are covered including English language understanding
 part-tu main hone vaale angreji ke prashnon or aptitude test kaa hi chaatr virodh kar rahe hai
 Indian-speaking students get stuck in part-two
 prashn kaa jawaab galat likhane par negative marking kaa nuksaan bhi chaatro ko uthaanaa padataa he
 Both papers are compulsory because English language students are ahead
 itihaas1989 tak upiessi kaa madhyam angreji hi tha, lekin andolan ke baad civil sevaaon kii pariksha main anya bhashaaon ko bhi jagah mil saki
 As a result, students from Hindi and other Indian languages started coming in large numbers in administrative services
 iske baad 2008 se mukhya pariksha main angreji or hindi donon ke prashnpatron ko anivaary kar diya
 This increased the trouble of Hindi speaking students
 had to tab ho gai jab 2011 main si-sat pariksha pattern main angreji ke ankon ko merit main jodne kii prakriya shuru kar di
 According to the data of UPSC, the number of students who cleared English in the UPSC examination in 2008 was 50
 57 fisadi thi jo 2009 main badhkar 54

 In 2008, 5082 students took the Civil Services Examination in Hindi language which reduced to 1682 in 2011
 2008 main telegu bhashaa main 117 chaatro ne pariksha di thi jo 2011 main ghatakar 29 rah gayi
 In 2008, 98 students took the exam in Tamil language, which was reduced to 5 in 2011

 The government says that all the preparations have been done as of the date of 24 August
 isliye pariksha kii tithi main badlaav sambhav nahin he
 Students failing in lieu of this can be given another chance
 sarkaar ne yah bhi elaan kiya ki pre pariksha kii merit main angreji ke ank nahin jode jaaenge
 However, opposition parties are still attacking against the government
 congress netaa rajeev shukla ne kaha ki jab tak sarkaar nyaay nahin karti hamaara virodh jari rahegaa
 SP MP Naresh Aggarwal said that the national language of the country is being ignored
 vahiin jediu netaa sharad yadav ne kaha ki ab to aisa lag rahaa he sarkaar ko ghoshit kar dena chahie ki hindi bhashiyon or bhartiya bhashaaon ke liye ye desh he hi nahin
 Aam Aadmi Party leader Yogendra Yadav said that C-SAT is not limited to English number twenty

 Maitryan and several Congress members from Andhra Pradesh demanded that civil service question papers should be given in all Indian languages
 chaatro kaa pakshachatro kaa kahana he ki unki maang pariksha se si-sat ko puri tarah se hataane ko lekar he, jise sarkaar ne puraa nahin kiya
 Students say that CSAT is leaning in favor of management and technical students
 yahi vajah he ki ham log sisat ko hataane kaa virodh kar rahe hai
 Students say that while GS (general Studies) gets 2 marks for a question, 2 for writing the correct answer for a question from C-SAT
 5 ank diya jaataa hai
 Apart from this, there are more of questions related to comprehension in C-SAT question paper, which has a lot of problem in understanding Hindi translation
 duusari ore yah formet science stream or ejineering-management se sambandhit chaatro ke liye laabhakaari sabit hota he
 Apparently, the difference of evaluation between GS and C-SAT also goes in favor of students of English medium and Science stream

 Taliban militants attacked the Jalalabad airport in the eastern region of Afghanistan on Monday evening
 is hamale main kai logon ke maare jane kii ashanka jataai gai he
 The attack was carried out at Jalalabad airport in Afghanistan's Nangarhar province at around 9 pm on Monday
 adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki atyaadhunik hathiyaaron se las aatankwaadiyon ne hawaondde ke purvi or mukhyadwar par hamalaa bol diya lekin vahaan tainaat surakshakarmiyon ne hamale kaa munhtod jawaab diya or unhen peeche hatane ke liye majaboor kar diya
 He said that about 30 minutes after the encounter with the terrorists, the security personnel completely brought the situation under control
 haryana ke khilaadiyon ko puraskaar raashi or vigyapanon se milane vaale paison kaa ek-tihaai hissaa haryana khel parishad ko dene ke faisle par haryana sarkaar ne aglaa aadesh aane tak roak laga di he
 Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar gave this information through a tweet on Friday
 haryana sarkaar ke khilaadiyon se unki aay kaa hissaa dene kaa faisla aane ke baad rajya sarkaar kii chautarafa aalochana ho rahi thi
 In the face of this criticism, the government immediately stopped this decision for further notice
 mukhyamantri ne twit main likhaa, 'maine khel vibhaag se is sambandh main sabhi filein or jaankaree maangi he or agle aadesh tak 30 april ko jari kii gai adhisuchana ko roak diya gaya he
 We are proud of the matchless contribution of our players
 'isse pehle, khel evam yuva kalyaan vibhaag ke pradhan sachiv ashok khemka dwaara jari soochna main rajya sarkaar ne sabhi khilaadiyon se peshewar samaaroh se milane vaali puraskaar raashi or vigyapanon se milane vaali rakam kaa ek-tihaai hissaa dene kii baat kahi thi
 Following the Haryana government's decree, Indian players criticized the government's April 30 notification saying that one-third of the money taken from the players would be used for the development of sports and emerging talent in Haryana
 khemka ne is adhisuchana par 27 april ko hastakshar kiye the, jisamen kaha gaya tha ki, 'khilaadi unke peshewar samarohon or vigyapanon se qaraar se milane vaale dhan kaa ek-tihaai hissaa haryana rajya khel parishad ko denge or yah dhan rajya main khel ke or ubhartee pratibhaaon ke vikaas main istemaal kiya jayega
 The move has been criticized by many players and has also reprimanded the state government
 haalanki sarkaar ke aadesh par roak lagane se pehle haryana ke khel mantri anil vij ne khemka ne faisle kaa bachaav kiya tha
 Vij had said, 'there is nothing new in this decision
 yah sarkaar kaa purana niyam he
 Under Rule 56, if a government employee earns business or commercial income, he has to deposit one-third of the earnings with the state government
 hamane peshewar (antarrashtriya mukkebaaz) vijender singh ko vyavsaayik rup se khilne kii ijaajat di thi
 (punjab and Haryana) The High Court asked us to make rules in this regard
 hamane ab niyam laae hai
 Khemka said that this notification was issued when the state assured the court that the Haryana government would bring the policy with people playing professional sports
 aam taur par, sarkari karmchaariyon ko peshewar khel khilne kii anumati nahin he
 The money will only be used for the benefit of the players
 khatter sarkaar kaa farmaan- vigyaapan se kamai kaa 33% hissaa sarkari khajaane main den khiladibharat kii mahila kushti pahalwaan gita phogot ne ek televijan channel ko die bayaan main is faisle kii aalochana kii thi, 'yah nayaa niyam khilaadiyon kaa majaak bana rahaa he
 There is no such rule for cricket players who earn more than the players who participate in other sports
 cricket khilaadi vigyapanon se bahut paisa kamaate hai, lekin mukkebaaji, kabddi or kushti ke khilaadi itnaa nahin kamaate hai
 'geeta had asked the government in question,' If we give one-third of our earnings, it will not be right for us
 aisi sthiti main hamaare liye kya rah jayega?'iske alaava, pahalwaan susheel kumaar ne bhi is faisle ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaai he
 Players employed by government departments and those who participate in professional sports or commercial support will also have to contribute one-third

 inamen ek sawaal tha ki main to china ke nyote par gai thi phir nishpaksh kaise ho sakati hum? lekin sach ye he ki aisa kai baar hota he ki koi desh yaa sanstha apane yahaan patrakaron ko nyotaa detii he kyonki wo yaa to apane bare main duniya ko bataanaa chaahati he yaa apane bare main koi safai dena chaahati he
 The only problem with China at the moment is that many questions have been raised in the media of Western countries regarding its dealings with Uighur Muslims
 unke daman kaa aarope he or isliye china bhi apana paksh rakhana chahta he
 Therefore, by calling on journalists from many countries, he is also putting forward his side
 mere saath jo patrakaron kaa dal tha usamen japan, albania, turki, afghanistan, bangladesh, kazakhstan, kirgistan, dakshin korea, check republic or rus ke patrkaar bhi the
 Every journalist saw almost the same things and it was up to the journalists to see how they looked
 har patrkaar ne apane hisaab se report file kii
 Comments related to these questions also came to my documentary that i either favored China, or should have done the same with the Uyghurs
 lekin asal main maine kisi kaa paksh nahin liya he
 What i saw is told in this, neither much nor less
 ye bhi samajhane vaali baat he ki bina china sarkaar kii ijazat ke aap shinjiyang ja nahin sakate
 Two foreign journalists accompanying us were detained at Aksu Airport, despite Chinese officials accompanying them
 unhen bhi ye baat sabit kerani padi ki inhen china sarkaar ne hi bulaayaa he
 This is an after-effect of a time of terror
 duusari baat ye ki adhiktar uighar sirf uighar bhashaa bolte hai, bahut kam mandarin bolte hai
 Many interpreters were required to talk to him many times
 to bhashaa ke maamle main ham in par nirbhar the
 But it is also true that we asked every type of question and found the answer, as you can see in the documentary
 yahaan par chini adhikariyon yaa chini dubhashie ke bina hamen koi uighar nahin mila
 There was no way to independently verify what he talked about, so he showed it without comment
 or jo Between the Lines laga wo bhi bataaya
 Yesterday, if a Uighur Muslim outside China tells the story of repression with strong evidence, he is also not averse to put it in front
 hamen vahaan isse jude aise kisse bhi mili jahaan kuch uighar yuva ye kah rahe hai ki unke mitra bhi aise vokational training centre main aana chaahate hai kyonki baahar se is prakaar kii training kaaphi mahangi padati he
 Some Han Chinese also say that why should their children not get such training for free? So this is also a stance of the picture
 shinjiyang main aatanki hamale hue yah bhi sach he or ab teji se vikaas kiya ja rahaa he, ye bhi
 And this is what i have shown in my documentary
 ham hameshaa pashchimi media kii hi baat kyon maane? kyonki sach ke bhi kai paksh hote hai, maine har paksh saamne rakh diya he

 The Congress announced the raising of the issue of 'espionage and surveillance' of Rahul Gandhi in Parliament, seeking a comprehensive explanation from the Home Minister and the Prime Minister on the issue and rejected the claim of the police that the case was just a security issue

 Taking part in this discussion, Sharad Yadav said that he is surprised who has prepared the statement of the Prime Minister
 kisi ne kapil sibbal kaa naam liya to sibbal ne khadey hokar mazaakia andaaj main kaha ki vah keval do mantralay kaa kaarybhaar sambhaal rahe hai
 See LIVE till today, Sharad Yadav said as much as he said that he is handling not many, but many ministries

 By breaking the lock of Delhi BJP state president Saxamnoj Tiwariensiling has given a new color to this campaign
 manoj tiwari ne daawa kiya he ki ceiling ke khilaaf is ladaai main wo or unki party dillivaasiyon ke saath he
 But is his own party appearing with him on this issue ?? Learn in this special report of 'aaj Tak' 
 
 masalaa court ke paas he: vijendra guptabijepi vidhayak va netaa vipaksh vijendra gupta se jab bhi ceiling ke mudde par baat kii jaati he to wo mukhyamantri kejariwal or unki sadak notiphoi kii bhoomika par sawalia nishaan khadey karte nazar aate hai
 Netaji also has a lot of knowledge to speak on the issue of sealing, but when asked the question of his state president Manoj Tiwari breaking the lock, he said that this issue is with the court
 tiwari ne kuch galat nahin kiya: udit rajajahir he vijendra gupta keemnoj tiwarike is taala tod abhiyaan ke bare main koi samarthan raay nahin he lekin pashchimi dilli se bijepi saansad udit raaj apane pradesh adhyaksh kaa saath dete najar aate hai
 Udit Raj says that we are populating Delhi
 aam aadmi party ne dilli main araajaktaa failaai he
 Udit Raj said that Ceiling is getting a Supreme Court Committee, Tiwari has done nothing wrong
 kuch nahin boluungaa: vijay goyalto vahiin kendriya mantri vijay goyal ke paas bhisiling ke masale parpura prastaav he
 There are stories to tell
 bakhaan karne ke liye khubiyaan hai
 Vijay Goyal has the entire reel to tell about the sealing issue, but the reel stops as soon as he asks about state president Manoj Tiwari and he says on the camera that i will not speak on this matter yet
 tiwari ne janata kaa aakrosh vyakt kiya: pravesh vermabahari dilli se loksabhaa saansad pravesh verma ceiling ke mudde par baat karte hi mukhyamantri kejariwal ko jimmedaar tehraane lagate hai or mukhyamantri ke laai detector test kii maang karte hai

 janata apane pratinidhi ko isliye hi chunati he
 Breaking the lock is wrong: After OP Sharmasand Vijay Goel, Udit Raj, Pravesh Verma, MLA Vijendra Gupta, mlas start cursing the monitoring committee in the name of OP Ceiling

 Clearly, not all BJP leaders are seen united in this task of breaking the lock with state president Manoj Tiwari, on the other hand there are mps like Udit raj-pravesh Verma who are supporting their president

 "bassi had advised to build the bridge", Parrikar said, after which he asked the then Commissioner of Delhi Police BS Bassi about this
 police kamishnar ne kaha kii lakhon logon kii bheed ko dekhte hue bhagdad kaa khatra he

 In such a situation, there will be difficulties regarding the safety of the temple

 a senior official said that 'the state government has spoken of not being able to provide strong security after the gold layer is installed on the temple
 ' udhar, shahi trust or paryaton adhikariyon se ab yah andekhi sahan nahin ho paa rahi
 After the disappointment of the state government's attitude, the matter has now been brought directly to Union Tourism Minister k Chiranjeevi
 thai tourism ke adhikariyon ke saath ek bhartiya pratinidhi-mandal buudhvaar ko bangkok airport par chiranjeevi se mila
 Chiranjeevi was returning to Delhi after attending the ASEAN Tourism Ministers Conclave in Laos

 chiranjeevi kaa maananaa he ki shahi parivaar kii taraf se milane vaala yah gift rajya sarkaar, mandir or rajya paryaton ke liye acha hoga
 This will be beneficial not only for Bihar but also for India
 bodh gaya zyada prasiddh ho jayega or iske jariye baaki buddha mandir bhi pahchaan main aa sakate hai
 publicitychiranjeevi said that we can not ignore the popularity of this
 buddha mandiron ke saath saath bihar or puure bharat ko iskaa laabh hoga
 This step will also be true for the development of Bihar's infrastructure
 ASEAN deshon se yahaan log aaenge to desh main paryaton ko badhaava milegaa
 It is not that Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar is unaware of this benefit
 baavjood iske sarkaar ne suraksha se sambandhit chintaaon ke chalate is prastaav par lagbhag anichhaa jaahir kii he
 Mail Today tried to contact the Chief Minister of Bihar on this issue, but they were not available
 samvaadadaata ne unke liye ek sandesh bhi choda ki jab bhi unhen yah sandesh mili, is par pratikriya den
 But there was no response till late in the evening
 haalanki kendriya adhikariyon ne is maamle main gend nitish sarkaar ke paale main daal di he
 a big authority said that if the state government cannot take the responsibility of protecting the most famous temple of Bihar, then what will happen to the security system in the entire state? He said that the state government will have to take steps for a strong security system
 
 
 
 And in this case, the game Blame Game is also going on
 ek adhikaar ne bataaya ki rajya kii ore se rani kii trust ko koi rispance nahin diya gaya he
 The government is blaming those authorities which are connected to the temple
 isamen mandir ke sanchaalan main bhagidaar buddha bhikshuon samet rajya prashasan ke logon ko lapeta ja rahaa he
 When it comes to local babus, they blame the Archaeological Survey of India and say that an ASI is obstructing
 bangkok or laos main conklev main bhaag lene pahunche chiranjeevi ko buddha logon kii taraf se kuch or shikaayatein bhi sunne ko mili hai
 The biggest complaint is the absence of common facilities, such as toilets etc
 yah samasya puure bharat main he, lekin se shikaayat kuch zyada hi he
 Senior officials said that the Union Tourism Minister had no answer when such problems were put before him

 According to Lele, Dhoni should have told the board earlier
 unhone dhoni par chayankartaaon par prabhaav daalane kaa bhi aarope lagaaya
 Jaywant Lele said about Dhoni's sports company whether it is good for cricket or not, it is a matter of discussion, but it has a straight Conflict of Interest
 dhoni teenon formet main bhartiya team ke captain hai
 In such a situation, there may also be pressure created by his sports company to include Suresh Raina, Ravindra Jadeja, RP Singh and Pragyan Ojha in the team
 sabase badi baat to yah he kii bataur captain kya yah dhoni kaa naitik ferj nahin he ki board ko suchit karen?lele ne kaha, 'mere hisaab se isamen dhoni dwaara board ko suchit kiya janaa chahie tha or yah unki naitik jimmedaari banati he

 It is unusual for the US President to attend any such public event with a foreign leader visiting his country

 Obviously, Trump may have seen some advantages in this

 Like most of the new immigrant communities in the US, most people in the indian-american community support the Democratic Party, because they need diversity and plurality to thrive in order to establish themselves with local communities
 sirf kuch amir tabake hi apwaad hai, jo karon main kami or niyam-kaayadon main dheel se phayda uthaane kii koshish karte rahete hai
 Trump would also like to bring swing votes in frontier constituencies and receive funding for his 2020 election campaign
 bhartiya-america samudaay ab america main sabase bada madhyam aay jaateey samooh he or sabase zyada padhaa-likhaa bhi
 Even in the 2016 election campaign, a section campaigned and raised money for them, while most immigrant groups kept their distance

 In his meetings with the Prime Minister of both India and Pakistan, Trump refused to put pressure on Pakistan on the issue of terrorism
 isse unke saudebaaji ke najariye kaa pataa chalata he kyonki unhen afghanistan ke sandarbh main pakistan kii jarurat he
 However, Trump's presence was beneficial for the indian-american community and the us-india relationship
 unhone healthcare, technology or america mulyon ko samrudh karne main samudaay ke yogadan kaa bakhaan kiya
 It was saying the president who fueled anti-immigrant sentiments, tightened the H1B visa process and banned the work of wives of H4 visa holders

 According to news agency AFP, US President Donald Trump told reporters in the Oval Office that 'this is a very dangerous situation between the two countries
 ' unhone yah bhi kaha ki is samay bharat or pakistan ke bich bahut sari samasyaayein hai
 Let us know that on February 14, 40 soldiers were killed in the Pulwama terror attack and the responsibility of this terrorist attack was taken by the terrorist organization jaish-e-mohammed
 darasal, pulavama aatanki hamale ke baad bharat pakistan ko vaishvik taur par alag-thalag karne kii koshish kar rahaa he
 It is being told that the security forces in the Kashmir Valley are now the biggest terrorist attack of this century

 India has said that it has strong evidence of Pakistan's involvement in the Pulwama attack and Pakistan and ISI are fully involved in this attack
 haalanki, pakistan sarkaar ne hamale ko "gambhir chintaa kaa vishay" bataate hue isamen shaamil hone se inkaar kiya he
 In fact, on Thursday, February 14, the CRPF convoy was going from Jammu to Srinagar
 is kafile main kareeb 78 gaadiyaan thim or 2500 jawan shaamil the
 At the same time, overtaking from the left came a car loaded with explosives and hit the bus of CRPF

 30 baje kar di gai thi
 Colors decided to change its slot to prime time so that the show would remain on Indian television, but it seems the show did not benefit
 or isi kaaran supanatural sho tantra ab jald hi band hone vaala he
 Let us know that the ratings of the show have been consistently low and the show failed to meet the expectations

 The river Kosi, infamous for wreaking havoc, may not have caused much havoc so far this year, but the weather forecast for next week of heavy rain in Nepal has killed the people of Bihar
 'bihar kaa shok' yani kosi ko lekar yahaan ke log dare-sahame hue hai
 Four drops of rain falling on the land of neighboring Nepal also make people here, because the change in Kosi stream and the rumor of breaking the embankment also make the people here to leave their homes and run away
 kosi kaa khauf yahaan ke logon ke dilo-dimag par chaaya hua he
 Some consider it to be the anger of Kosi, while some consider it the result of a flawed strategy of the government
 sarkaar har saal in ilaakon main baadh aane ke baad raahat va punarvaas kii ghoshnaa karti rahi he, parantu aaj bhi logon ko un raahat or punarvaas yojanaon kaa laabh sahi dhang se pahunchane kaa intjaar he
 In the year 2008, the people of the city have still not forgotten the night of August 18
 kushhaa ke tatbandhon ko todakar nikali kosi ne rajya ke kai jilon main jo tabaahi machaai thi, us ghaav par aaj tak maraham nahin lagaaya gaya he
 Apparently, the wounds are still green
 yah digar he ki kaaphi prayaas ke baad kosi kii prachand dhaaraon ko phir se unheen sthanon par baandh diya gaya he
 Anirudh Prasad Yadav, MLA of Nirmali assembly constituency in Supaul district, says that the people here get frightened as soon as it rains, but who is affected by the natural disaster
 yadav ne kaha ki nepal se sate bihar ke ilaakon main barsaat ke mausam main afvaah failaane vaale tatv bhi sakriy ho jate hai
 The legislator said that the administration is fully prepared to deal with the floods in these areas
 log ishwar se prarthana karte rahete hai ki kosi kii pralanyakaari dhara unke gaanv kii taraf nahin aae
 People have agreed that stopping the Kosi stream is not a matter of government or any human control
 ise to bhagwaan hi roak sakate hai
 Supaul resident Shivanandan Sah said that after the monsoon rains this year, Kosi is intent on eradicating the existence of Balwa village in Sadar block of the district
 kosi ke tandav ke bich lagbhag 300 pariwaron ke 400 ghar buree tarah kshatigrast ho chuke hai
 Kosi has ruined the growing crop in thousands of hectares
 log jaan bachaane ke liye gaanv chhod palaayan kar rahe hai
 According to another villager, due to the erosion of Kosi, two-three villages have also been absorbed in Kosi's womb
 ab yahaan ke nivaasiyon ke liye sthaayee taur par visthaapan kii samasya aa gai he
 They say that the administration has made claims to deal with the floods, but when the situation gets worse, the claims of their claims are exposed
 ve kehete hai ki prashasan agar naavon kii vyavastha rakhe to aadhi pareshaani dur ho sakati he
 There are also people in these areas, whose fields are still full of sand (sand) for three years
 virpur ke logon ne bataaya ki abhi bhi unke kheton main baaluu kaa dher jamaa he
 He said that the government may have sent some relief material to the victims, but due to the sheaves of sand, they are beginning to see their future as 'sand walls'
 kosi traasadee ke bhale hi paanch varsh guzar gaye hon, lekin yahaan ke logon ke 'jakhm' itane gahare ho chuke hai ki un par koi 'maraham' bhi kargar sabit nahin ho rahaa he

 Modi was the Chief Minister of Gujarat during the Gujarat riots
 un par dheron iljaam lage lekin vakt ke saath modi ne apane kaam ke dam par un chizon ko peeche chhod diya
 At that time too many documentary films were made on Modi and documentary films were made on him even after he became the Prime Minister

 The Indian Medical Council objected to the provisions of the National Medical Commission Bill 2017

 Now, according to the new bill, there will be a total of 25 members, out of which only 5 representatives from 36 states
 3
 There is a provision to include Ayush in the Indian Medical Register by getting a bridge course, which will be almost equal to MBBS
 4
 After MBBS, one has to give another exam to practice
 5
 At the same time, these exams were to be given to those doing MBBS from abroad
 ab nae bill main unako is exam se chhot he
 The IMA had appealed to halt the work of the OPD, in protest against this bill, on Tuesday the IMMA decided to go on strike
 IMA ne doctoron se apil kii thi ki subah 6 baje se shaam 6 baje tak privet se lekar sarkari aspataalon ke opidi thap rahenge, lekin aisa hua nahin

 The same was also with GB Pant Hospital

 At the same time, the strike was not visible in private hospitals of Delhi

 Coach Kirsten said, we had decided that all new players would be taken in the auction
 pichley sijan ke ek bhi khilaadi ko rittin nahin kiya jayega
 In such a situation, the question was not whether or not to keep Sehwag
 gairi bole ki yah faisla sahi he yaa galat, iskaa faisla to sijan ke baad hi hoga
 But this was the option before us

 anantnag main amarnath yatra par gaye shraddhaluon par aatanki hamale ke dauraan logon ne aise hi ek bachaane vaale ko dekha
 Name is Salim Sheikh
 salimus bas kaa driver he, jis par somvaar kii raat aatankwaadiyon ne hamalaa kiya tha lekin andhadhundh goliyon kii bauchhaar ke bich saleem ne apni jaan kii parvaah kiye bagair jis tarah se bas main baithe shraddhaluon kii jaan bachaane kii koshish kii, us par kisi ko bhi naaz ho saktaa he
 The government has awarded the second highest award of wages to Abdriversalim Sheikh
 saleem shaikh gafoor ko bahaduri ke liye uttam jivan rakshak padak se nawaja gaya he
 Salim Sheikh will also be given a reward of Rs one lakh with honors
 apni is bahaduri ke liye puraskaar milane par baat karte hue saleem shaikh ne kaha ki use afsos is baat kaa he ki wo un 7 yatriyon ko nahin bachaa paaya, jo aatankwaadiyon kii goli kaa shikaar ho gayi
 However, i am also glad that my understanding at that time saved the lives of more than 30 passengers
 dashahara ke din 30 sitambar se congress ke diggaj netaa or madhya pradesh ke purv mukhyamantri digvijay singh dharmik yatra kaa aagaaz karne vaale hai
 He will walk about 3500 km during his Narmada journey and he will complete this distance in 6 months
 is yatra ko wo apane guru swami swaroopanand ke narsinghpur sthit joteshwar ashram se shuru karne vaale hai
 6 months will remain away from politics during the journey
 khaas baat to yah ki unki yatra ke dauraan congress kaa jhanda nahin hoga or naa hi kisi netaa ko nyotaa bheja jayega
 Yes, if a worker wants to go along on the journey then he can walk
 lekin usko bhi gaiyr siyaasi anushaasan kaa paalan karnaa hoga
 Due to this visit, Digvijay requested the high command to relinquish the charge of Goa, Telangana and Karnataka as Congress general secretary, which was accepted
 gauratlab he ki ab diggi congress mahasachiv to hai, par sirf andhra pradesh kaa prabhaar unke paas he, jahaan rajya ke bantwaare ke baad philhal congress kahin najar nahin aati
 The only thing that is interesting is that during this personal religious journey, Digvijay will be officially supported by his wife Amrita Singh during this personal religious visit
 is yatra main digvijay or unki patni mangakar mila hi khaanaa pakaakar khaaenge
 It is certain that during the journey, neither will they go to anyone's house and eat nor will they get food made from someone's house
 ye sab isliye he ki, digvijay is yatra ko puri tarah aadhyatmik rakhana chaahate hai
 Contrary to the image, Diggi Raja has been reciting a lot of pooja, due to his statements, Digvijay has always been a target of BJP, he has also been given the title of Maulana Digvijay
 lekin asal jindagi main digvijay khaasaa puja paath karte he
 Digvijay has been doing barefoot circumambulation of the 24-km Govardhan mountain every year
 saath hi navadurgon main devi puja or siddh peeth jaakar puja karnaa unki parampara main he
 Every year, visiting Pandharpur in Maharashtra, pictures of pooja text have been coming
 isliye digvijay is nai yatra ko nai cheez nahin maanate
 Just say that, i had been in my mind for a long time that i decided to revolve around Maa Narmada
 maa narmada ke aashirwad se puri bhi karuunga
 Narmada's road will not be easy for Diggi Raja, who has crossed the 70 halt of Diggi Umaar of 70's health, will walk 20 kilometers daily
 3500 kilometre kii is paidal yatra ko unako 180 din main patni ke saath puraa karnaa he yani rojaanaa subah shaam 10-10 kilometre paidal yatra
 In this regard, Digvijay has also started preparing with his wife
 vaise to subah jaldi uthakar yoga karnaa or phir desi vyaayaam karnaa diggi raja kii dincharya kaa hissaa saalon se rahaa he
 Meeting and talking to people walking fast in the lawn of their kothi also shows Diggi's awareness of health
 swasthya ke lihaaj se diggi pine or nahaane ke liye hameshaa gunaguna pani hi istemaal karte hai, thande pani kaa istemaal karte hi nahin
 Considering this, Diggi says in a rough manner that, the leader and the singer have to keep the throat well, so i always use lukewarm water
 yatra ke chalate patni sang rose lodi garden main shuru kii 15-20 kilometre kii walking70 ke diggi narmada yatra kii kathinata samajhate hai
 So, in his old routine, he has also added walking for 15-20 kilometers at a time
 yatra 30 sitambar se shuru honi he, lekin us pariksha main paas hone ke liye digvijay ne ek maheene pehle se hi apane lodi road ke ghar ke paas lodi garden main rose shaam 15-20 kilometre paidal chalanaa shuru kar diya he
 Diggi said - Yatra religious - spiritual, anti - said - only this happened politically, the story of Diggi Raja's visit to Narmada, which Diggi Raja is telling
 lekin agar aalochakon or netaaon kii baat karen to unka saaf kahana he ki, digvijay kii ye yatra kareeb 140 vidhansabha kshetron se gujaregi, jisamen kareeb 114 vidhansabha kshetra madhya pradesh ke or 26 vidhansabha kshetra gujarat ke aaenge
 In such a situation, he has been a player of political life for all his life, even though he says that his journey is not political, but the timing of the journey scheduled during the election of Gujarat in late 2017 and then Madhya Pradesh in 2018 shows that, No, the aim is political

 Amidst the possibility of Patel's reservation getting a boost in the upcoming assembly elections in Gujarat, the Congress said it would make it an issue to give 20 percent reservation to the economically weaker people of the state
 party ne yah bhi spasht kiya ki yah aarakshan anusuchit jati or anusuchit janajati ke maujuuda aarakshan ko aparivartit rakhte hue diya janaa chahie
 Congress spokesperson Shakti Singh Gohil said, "if the Congress government is formed in Gujarat, we will give reservation on the basis of economic to the poor people of all castes including Patidars who are not being given reservation right now
" aarthik rup se pichde logon ko 20 pratishat aarakshan dete samay yah bhi dekha jayega ki vartmaan main anusuchit jati evam anusuchit janajatiyon ko abhi jo aarakshan mil rahaa he usamen koi chhedchhad na ho
 He said that the people of the state had set high hopes from the BJP
 kintu rajya or kendra, donon jagah bhaajapa unki ummiido par khari nahin utari he
 When people are comparing with the Congress rule of 22 years ago, they feel that BJP has made only false promises
 unhone in daavon ko galat bataaya ki gujarat main congress kii sthiti kamjor he
 He said, "we were weak in 1990 when we got only 30 seats
 uske baad se ham 60 ke aasapaas siten jitate aa rahe hai
 Apart from these, we need 30-35 seats which we hope to get in this assembly election

 While giving 20 percent reservation to economically backward people, it will also be seen that there is no tampering in the reservation that is currently being given to scheduled castes and scheduled tribes
 ’’ unhone kaha ki rajya ke logon ne bhaajapa se bahut ummiden lagaayi thim
 But both in the state and the Center, the BJP has not met their expectations
 log jab 22 saal pehle ke congress shashan se tulana kar rahe hai to unhen lag rahaa he ki bhaajapa ne mahaj jhuthe vaade kiye
 He rubbished claims that the Congress was weak in Gujarat
 unhone kaha, ‘‘1990 main ham kamjor the jab hamako keval 30 siten mili thim

 Regarding the perceived differences between Indian captain Virat Kohli and coach Anil Kumble, former Australian captain Michael Clarke believes that great relationships present greater challenges
 clark ne press test se baatcheet main kaha, 'kisi bhi rishte main khulepan or eemaandaaree kii jarurat hoti he
 It is the same in cricket in which there is a captain and a coach
 aapako eemaandaar rahanaa hota he
 They said that differences are inevitable but they can be resolved within the room
 kisi bhi achche rishte main chunautiyaan bhi badi hoti he
 The former Australian captain said he would be wrong to say something in the case of Kumble and Kohli as he is not part of the dressing room
 clark ne kaha ki main anil kumble ko jaanata hum jo behtareen insaan he
 The coach's job is to help the captain in the dressing room
 mujhe nahin pataa ki kya masalaa he kyonki main dressing room kaa hissaa nahin hum
 However, the World Cup winning captain said that cricket teams run captains
 unhone kaha ki main saaf taur par kahana chahta hum ki nirnaayak kshanon main jimmedaari captain kii hoti he
 Within the field, Virat is commanded by the team
 use hi tanaav ke halaat main faisle lene honge
 He said, 'the result is important in this game and the captain is judged on the basis of victory and defeat
 ' tippaniyan Clarke, now a well-known cricket expert, gave an example of a father and son relationship
 unhone kaha ki bacchon ke laalan-paalan kii koi ek style nahin hoti
 Everyone has their own style because not every child is the same
 cricket main bhi aisa hi he
 Clarke's style of captaincy was different, but he was passionate about Virat's passion and aggression
 unhone kaha, 'viraat shandaar captain he
 He is quite competitive and captains the same way
 ab tak takneekee taur par vah behtareen sabit hua he
 Asked about the Champions Trophy, he said that he now sees the possibility of a final between India and England when Australia is eliminated
 unhone kaha, austelia baahar ho chukaa he or england bhi prabal daavedaar he
 He was entitled to go to the finals
 mujhe lagata he ki bharat or england ke bich final hoga
 (apart from the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it has been published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) Clarke said in a conversation with Press Trust, "any relationship requires openness and honesty
 cricket main bhi aisa hi he jisamen ek captain or ek coach hota he
 You have to be honest
 unhone kaha ki matbhed hona laazmi he lekin unhen kamare ke bheetar suljhaayaa ja saktaa he
 In any good relationship, the challenges are also big
 australia ke purv captain ne kaha ki kumble or kohli ke maamle main unka kuch kahana galat hoga kyonki vah dressing room kaa hissaa nahin hai
 Clarke said that i know Anil Kumble who is a great person
 coach kaa kaam dressing room main maujuud captain kii madad karnaa he
 i don't know what the issue is because I'm not part of the dressing room
 vishwacap vijeta captain ne haalanki kaha ki cricket timen captain chalaate hai
 He said that i want to say clearly that in the decisive moments, the responsibility lies with the captain
 maidan ke bheetar team kii kaman viraat ke haath main he
