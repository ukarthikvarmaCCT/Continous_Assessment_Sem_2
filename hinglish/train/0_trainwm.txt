 The world famous Sonepur Cattle Fair is buzzing with the din of theaters
 prashasan ne pehle theatreon ko license dene se manaa kar diya tha, lekin sonpur meley ke dukandaaron or vyapaariyon ke virodh ke chalate aakhirkaar prashasan ko jhukna padaa

 unke yajmaanon kii sankhya main giravat aa gai thi, lekin ab sab thik ho gaya he
 Along with licensing theaters, the administration has warned sternly that if indecent dance or alcohol was consumed in the theater, the license would be canceled with immediate effect
 halaki theatre maalikon ko har roj license lenaa pasta he
 All theaters have CCTV cameras, which are controlled by the administration
 jila kaarykram adhikari bhi isaki nigarani karte hai, taaki theatre main koi ashleelata na ho
 The SP of Saran suddenly refused to license theaters at the Sonepur fair, fearing that pornography would spread under the guise of the theater
 dilachasp baat yah he ki unako yah khyaal tab aayaa, jab theatre vaale apana saajon-samaan or tamzam sonpur meley main laga chuke the
 Even dancers working in the theater had reached
 prashasan ke is faisle kaa kaaphi virodh hua
 Along with the dancers, the shopkeepers and traders also protested by taking a day's strike, when the administration agreed to give the license

 Last year, demonetisation hit most theaters, due to which only nine theaters have been set up this year
 pichley saal in theatreon kii sankhya 12 thi
 The history of theater is as old as the Sonepur fair

 Due to obscenity in theaters, the format of the Bawalsonpur fair also changed with time
 ek samay aisa bhi aayaa, jab sonpur meley main lagane vaale in theatreon main ashleelata or nagn pradarshan kii vajah se bahut bavaal machane laga
 Demand to close theaters was also rising, but the tradition of the theater continues with the fair
 theatre ke jariye desh ke kai rajyon se mahila kalakaar sonpur meley main jutati hai
 Babli from Delhi has told that she runs her home by doing stage shows
 vah pichley chaar saal se lagaataar sonpur meley ke theatre main maheene bhar ke liye aati hai
 They also enjoy walking around the fair with earnings
 theatre ke bina vyavsaay par padataa he asarsonpur meley ke theatreon kaa vyavsaayik pahalu bhi behad ahm he
 Kashmir's hot clothing businessman Fida Hussain says that not having a theater at the fair makes a lot of difference to business
 theatre dekhne dur-dur se log meley main pahunchate he or meley ghoomane ke dauraan kharidari bhi karte hai
 Not having a theater reduces the number of people

 On the complaint of the minor, the mother, husband and Kazi have been arrested by the Mahim police
 police ne maamle main balaatkaar or pokso kii bhi dharaaen lagaai hai
 The case relates to Nayanagar in Mahim, where in March, the mother married her 13-year-old Betia to a 40-year-old man
 maa ne beti ke virodh ko bhi dabaa diya or kaazi ko bulaakar shaadi kii rasm puri kar beti ko vidaa bhi kar diya
 It is alleged that the husband forcibly had a physical relationship with her there and also assaulted and threatened to kill her if she resisted
 police ke mutabik- ek din mauka paakar naaballig pati ke ghar se bhagkar waapas maa ke paas aa gai, lekin maa use waapas pati ke paas bhejne ke liye jabardastee karne lagi
 According to Police Inspector Manohar Dhanavade - On May 6, the girl called the control and asked for help
 kol aane ke turant baad mahim police kii team ne maukey par pahunch kar ladki ko chhudaaya or maamla darj kar maa, pati asif ayub khan or kaazi ahamed razzaq ke khilaaf maamla darj kar teenon ko giraftaar kar liya
 According to the police- accused Asif has already had two marriages and is also the father of two children
 aaropee maa ne police ko bataaya ki uske pati kii maut ho chuki he
 The financial condition of the house is not good, so the minor daughter had to marry under compulsion

 suresh raina tab apratyaashit rup se vivaad kaa centre ban gayi jab ek british akhbaar ne daawa kiya ki unhen aisi mahila ke saath dekha gaya jiske kathith rup se sattebaajon se sambandh the lekin bhartiya cricket board ne in repotaren ko ‘aadharahin’ qaraar dete hue khaarij kar diya
 London's 'sunday Times' report claimed that the icc's anti-corruption and Security Unit is investigating why the BCCI is tight-lipped over the Sri Lankan cricket report, in which Raina is due in July
 agast main is dwipiya desh ke daure main ek mahila ke saath dekha gaya tha
 This woman is said to have a relationship with a bookie
 bisisiai sachiv en shrinivasana ne is report ko ‘aadharahin or galat’ qaraar karte hue kaha ki cricket board ko srilanka cricket se is tarah kii koi shikaayat nahin mili he
 He said in the statement that BCCI has just come to know from some media reports claiming that Sri Lankan cricket has submitted a report on Suresh Raina and the board has not taken any action on it
 unhone kaha ki bisisiai is baat ko saaf karnaa chahega ki hamen srilanka cricket se is tarah kii koi report nahin mili he
 These claims are being made by a section of the media which are baseless and false
 gussaye shrinivas ne kaha ki ve aise khilaadi ko nishaanaa bana rahe hai jo ab bharat kii taraf se acha pradarshan kar rahaa he
 BCCI spokesperson Rajiv Shukla also termed these reports as 'false' and said that the woman is Raina's agent
 shukla ne kaha ki yah galat or aadharahin he or bilkul bakawaas he
 The BCCI has not received any complaint from the ICC or the Sri Lanka Board
 bisisiai ko is sambandh main kabhi bhi koi shikaayat nahin mili he
 Actually this woman is Raina's agent
 bisisiai ke upaadhyaksh ne kaha ki raina kuch dastavejon par hastakshar karne or kuch aupchaariktaaon ko puraa karne ke liye is mahila ke saath the
 She is also an agent of some Sri Lankan players
 iskaa kisi bhrashtachar rodhi maamle yaa cricket ke baahar ke muddon se kuch lenaa dena nahin he
 He said that this is just media speculation and nothing else
 ‘sande times’ ke anusaar raina ek se zyada raaton ko is mahila ke saath dekhe gayi jo aise vyakti se judi hai jiskaa ek sattebaaj se sambandh he
 Accordingly, Sri Lanka reported to the BCCI at the Indian team's hotel in Sri Lanka apart from CCTV footage of Raina being seen with the woman who allegedly had a relationship with the bookie
 lekin srilanka cricket ne bhi isisi ko is tarah kii report dene se inkaar kiya he
 SLC Secretary Nishant Ranatunga said that this is news to me and there is no truth in this report
 akhbaar kii report ke mutabik bisisiai sachiv shrinivasana kii pratikriya ke baad hi isisi ne jaanch karnaa shuru kiya kyonki is report par karrwai ke bajaay un par aarope he ki unhone srilanka se ise waapas lene ko kaha
 The newspaper, citing an ICC source who did not name it, said that the head of the anti-corruption unit, Ravi Savani, is investigating it and it is believed that he is talking to Sri Lanka Cricket as to why he first reported it to the BCCI Whereas it should have gone directly to the ICC as the matter comes under the anti-corruption Unit of the ICC
 haalanki akhbaar ne saaf kiya ki raina par koi bhi galat kaam karne kaa andeh nahin he

 2014 main didie ke tahat hajaaron kii sankhya main logon ne ghar ke liye aavedan kiya tha
 Out of which 25 thousand people got a house and out of them 11 thousand people have returned flats to DDA
 40 fisadi logon ne lautaae didie flatsdilli main didie kya ghatiya quality ke makaan detii he, jo rahane laayak nahin hote hai
 This is not a question but an answer given within the Parliament
 do saal pehle yani 2014 main dilli main lakhon kii taadaad main gharon ke liye aavedan didie ke paas aae the
 Out of which only more than 25 thousand people could get a house
 25 hajaar flats main se lagbhag 11 hajaar logon ne flats sarender kar die, yani lautaa die hai
 This is surprising because finding a DDA house in Delhi is not less than a lottery
 yahi vajah he ki na sirf logon kodidie kii houseing skimkee ghoshnaa kaa intjaar hota he balki uski lottery kab nikal rahi he iskaa bhi intjaar rahata he

 sarkaar ne jawaab main ye bhi bataaya ki lautaane kii mukhya vajah gharon kaa chota hona or in gharon kii lokation he
 Since the allocation, serious questions were being raised on the quality of construction of these houses
 logon ne buniyadi suvidhaayen jaise pani or bijli kii aapurti ko lekar sawaal uthaae the
 Most of the flats were built on the outskirts of Delhi where connectivity is a major problem
 isliye logon ne rahane kii bajaae in gharon ko waapas didie ko lautaane main hi bhalaai samajhi
 What will happen to these houses now? Now the government is in the know how to find buyers for these houses
 aise sarender flaton ko nai policy ke tahat bechaa jayega, jisamen turm or condishan bhi nae honge
 But whether it will happen now or will happen in the upcoming scheme, it is not currently decided
 darasal didie abhi 60 hajaar nae flats or bana rahi he jo do saal main taiyaar ho jaaenge
 That is, we have to wait for 2018 for the next housing scheme

 smartphone ho, tablet yaa phir laptop
 Without internet access, the utility of these three seems to be meaningless
 yahi kaaran he ki mobile plan se lekar data card ke jariye log 24 ghante internet se jude rahanaa chaahate hai
 There is also a name of wi-fi connection in this link
 jarurat or maang ko dekhte hue ab shopping mal, hotel or yahaan tak tourist place par bhi free Wi-fi kii suvidha di ja rahi he, lekin muft conection ke chakkar main kai baar yugers hanking ke bhi shikaar ho jate hai
 But a little caution can prevent this
 agar aap bhi raah chalate, uthte-baithte free Wi-fi conection kaa istemaal karte hai to jaraa satark ho jaaie
 It can not only steal your data but can also harm your phone, tablet and laptop forever
 lekin isse bachanaa itnaa bhi mushkil nahin he
 There are some measures that can be avoided by hacker and burglar networks
 jaanch len koun sa network he sahiam taur par public place par kai saare free Wi-fi conection dikh sakate hai
 But connecting with anyone without information can be harmful
 iske liye sabase pehle jaruri he ki aap jahaan hai, vahaan kisi adhikari yaa karmchaaree se oficial network kaa naam puch lijie
 That is, if you are in a mall, then ask the name of the official wi-fi host of the mall there and then connect
 aksar ek-jaise naam yaa popular naam se conection kaa naam banaaya jaataa he or ek baar conect hone ke baad yah musiibat paidaa kar saktaa he
 Turn off sharing Turn off wi-fi sharing when using a public wi-fi connection
 agar aap windos kaa istemaal kar rahe hai to ise control panel main network and shering centre ke andar, advance shering setting main jaakar public heading ke neeche shering ko of kiya ja saktaa he
 On the other hand, if you are using a Mac, go to the system conference and go to the sharing icon and unmark the checkbox
 android divaais kaa istemaal karte hai to Wi-fi conection setting main jaakar shering ko of kiya ja saktaa he
 Use VPN: VPN means use of virtual private network also helps to make your wi-fi connection secure
 asal main yah tul sarwar or aapke divaais ke bich ke trephic ko code main badal detaa he, jisase havers yaa virus bhejne vaale ko aapke divaais par kaabo paane main pareshaani hoti he
 Better if your device has free VPN, otherwise there are many free VPN service providers on the Internet
 HTTPS kii jaanch karen, tabhi aage badhenyakeenan yah sabase puraan tarika he, lekin yah kargar bhi he
 If you use a Chrome, Opera or Firefox browser on your device, you will find that when a site is opened, it shows HTTPS before the web address
 yani broujar ke mutabik yah ek sef site he
 That is, looking at HTTPS can be better
 apadet karen lekin dhyaan sesurakshit Wi-fi conection ke liye jaruri he ki aap apane oparating system or eps ko apadet rakhen
 But also keep in mind that always update the phone, tablet or laptop on such connection, which you know that it is safe
 kai baar aisa dekha gaya he ki public Wi-fi ke istemaal ke dauraan ek baar conect hone ke baad lagaataar OS apadet, ptch yaa ap apadet ke opshan aane lagate hai
 Do not click on any such option until you have decided that the connection is secure
 asal main kai baar clic karne ke baad hekking yaa virus kaa akraman bhi ho saktaa he
 Do not keep the same password Many times it is seen that people keep the same password from social networking to mail ID and all accounts
 yah galat he
 Use different passwords
 aksar log wifi conection ke dauraan acount banane ke liye bhi apane usee khaas password kaa istemaal kar baithte hai, jisase havers ke liye kaam aasaan ho jaataa he
 Check before leaving the network
 Once connected to the wi-fi connection and then after the work is finished, close all your accounts and apps before logging off, logoff, which you have used recently
 saath hi conection setting main jaakar conect automaticli when awelabal ke opshan ko bhi anchek kar len
 If you are using an Android device, go to the wi-fi network list, press the name of the network for a few seconds and click on Forget network
 ios kaa istemaal karte hai to settings main jaakar, Wi-fi network ko salect karen or forget dis network par clic karen

 com / beexfochxi— ANI UP (@aninewsup) March 20, 2019isse pehle 10 march ko mukhya chunaav ayukta sunil aroda ne loksabhaa chunaav kii tarikhon kaa elaan kar diya tha
 In this way, there will be voting for Lok Sabha elections in all seven phases in Uttar Pradesh
 pehle charan ke liye 11 april or aakhri charan ke liye 19 may ko matdaan honge
 This will be followed by simultaneous election results on 23 May
 uttar pradesh main loksabhaa kii 80 site hai
 Let us tell you that in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party won 71 out of 80 seats
 iske alaava endie main bijepi kii sahyogi apana dal ne bhi do siten jiti thi
 The Bharatiya Janata Party formed a government at the Center under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the basis of a spectacular victory in Uttar Pradesh
 haalanki is baar uttar pradesh main bijepi ko kadi chunautiyon kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he
 Samajwadi Party (SP) and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) have formed an alliance to defeat the Bharatiya Janata Party in Uttar Pradesh
 haalanki is gathbandhan main abhi tak congress shaamil nahin hui he
 Earlier, the Congress was kept away from the SP-BSP alliance in UP, but when the Congress fielded Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, the whole political mathematics changed
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne loksabhaa chunaav ke liye apni bahan priyanka gandhi wadra ko party kaa mahasachiv banaaya he
 Also Uttar Pradesh is assigned the charge of East
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki priyanka gandhi wadra ke chunaav maidan main utarane ke baad se sapa-basapa gathbandhan congress ko apane saath laane kii koshish main he
 However, the Congress is not satisfied with the number of seats the SP-BSP alliance is trying to give
 lihaaja congress ne upi main apane dam par loksabhaa chunaav ladane kaa elaan kiya he
 In this episode, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra is touring in Uttar Pradesh
 abhi unhone prayagraj se banaras tak boat yatra kii thi
 Meanwhile, he also interacted with the people and attacked the BJP government fiercely
 varanasi pahunchakar priyanka gandhi ne pradhanmantri narendra modi par bhi sidhaa waar kiya
 He said that PM Modi did not fulfill the promises he had made in 2014
 kairana or nurpur upachunaav main ekajute vipaksh ke saamne BJP ko apane sahanubhuti vot kii aas he
 BJP has given ticket to Mriganka Singh, daughter of late MP Hukum Singh from Kairana seat
 vahiin, nurpur se divangat vidhayak lokentre singh kii patni avani singh ko tikat diya he
 On Wednesday, Avni Singh will file her nomination in Noorpur, while on Thursday, Mriganka Singh will file her nomination in Kairana
 kairana main mriganka singh kaa muqabla areldi kii tabassum hasan se he
 Tabassum was still in the Samajwadi Party, but under the alliance deal, this seat has been given to RLD
 isliye samaajawaadee party ne apana ummidavaar areldi ko diya he
 Opposition is expected to vote for Jats and Muslims here
 isaupachunaavamein ekajute vipaksh ke saamne BJP kii ladaai behad mushkil najar aa rahi he
 However, the party is claiming victory on the basis of its organization and sympathy vote
 bataa den, pehali baar sapa-basapa or areldi kaa gathjod kairana upachunaav main saamne aayaa he
 At the same time, the Congress is bound to give support without asking
 aise main 2019 ke pehle kairana upachunaav bijepi ke liye ek litmus test jaisaa he
 The BJP has given the responsibility of Sanjeev Balian Kokaranaki
 mujffarpur dangon se kairana palaayan tak main bad-chadhakar bayaan dene vaale sanjeev baalion sanghathan ke lihaaj se chunaav kii kaman sanbhale hue hai
 Significantly, after the by-elections in Gorakhpur and Phulpur, Mayawati had announced that she would not support any party in any by-election
 lekin andarkhaane sapa or basapa ke bich bane gathbandhan kaa asar dikhaai dene laga he
 Here the three parties are seen fighting unitedly on the ground
 rajyasabha main guuruuvaar ko lokapal vidheyak par jari charchaa ke dauraan naatakeey ghatnakram or hangaame ke kaaran sadan kii kaarywahi anischitkaal tak ke liye sthagit kar di gai
 The discussion on the bill continued from morning till 12 in the night, and the opposition created a ruckus when the government did not get a satisfactory response to further proceedings
 sadan main jari charchaa ke dauraan rashtriya janata dal (rajd) ke saansad raajnneeti prasad ne kaarywahi main baadha upasthit kii
 Prasad picked up some documents in front of Minister of State Narayan Sami and tore them in the Prime Minister's Office responding to the bill
 vidheyak par jari charchaa or uske baad mat vibhaajan ke bare main sarkaar kii taraf se koi santoshjanak jawaab na milane par sadan main hangaamaa hone laga
 Seeing the commotion, President Vice President Hamid Ansari took action 11
 45 tak sthagit kar di
 On the resumption of the proceedings of the House, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pawan Kumar Bansal said that the government has received 187 amendments during the discussion
 inamen se kuch sanshodhan kaaphi mahatvapurn hai jin par sarkaar ko vichaar karnaa hoga
 At the same time, the opposition once again started an uproar after the opposition was not getting any satisfactory response from the government, seeking answers regarding the discussion and division of the bill
 sadan ke netaa arun jetali ne kaha ki jo sarkaar matvibhaajan se peeche hat rahi ho use satta main rahane kaa adhikaar nahin he
 At the same time, Sitaram Yechury, a member of the Communist Party of india-marxist (CPI-M), asked the government what the program was for the discussion and division of the government
 sadsy uske bare main jaananaa chaahate hai
 He said that if the government does not have any plan in this regard, it should also inform about it
 sabhapati dwaara shant rahane kii baar-baar apil karne ke baavjood sadan main hangaamaa nahin thama to unhone sadan kii kaarywahi anischitkaal ke liye sthagit kar di
 Earlier, during the day-long discussion, there was a heated argument between the government and the opposition about the provisions of the bill
 sutron ne bataaya ki vidheyak ko lekar congress ko apni mahatvapurn sahyogi trinmul congress kaa bhi samarthan nahin mil paaya
 The Trinamool Congress introduced about 40 amendments, including the removal of the provision for the formation of Lokayuktas
 iske pehle sansadeey kaary rajya mantri rajeev shukla ne kaha, "ham maanate hai ki hamaare paas rajyasabha main paryaapt sankhya bal nahin he lekin ham vidheyak ko paarit karaane ke liye apana sarvshereshth prayaas kar rahe hai
 Our intention is completely clear
 " At the same time, there is also speculation that the Bill may be brought in the next session of Parliament in February
 aadhikarik sutron ne bataaya ki rajyasabha main subah pesh vidheyak main sanshodhan ke liye 187 prastaav die gaye
 Apart from the opposition parties, Trinamool Congress, Samajwadi Party (SP) and Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) proposed amendments to the bill
 rajyasabha main sarkaar ke paas bahumat nahin he
 The Trinamool Congress is part of the UPA while the SP and the RJD support the government from outside
 gyaat ho ki 243 sadasyon vaale sadan main congress or uske sahyogiyon kii sankhya 92 he, jabaki vidheyak paarit karaane ke liye sarkaar ko 122 sadasyon kaa samarthan chahie
 With the beginning of a heated debate on the bill in the House, the government also stepped up efforts to establish a majority figure
 vidheyak paarit karaane ke liye paryaapt sankhya bal apane paksh main karne ke liye congress kii kor samiti ne shaam ke samay apni ranneeti ko antim rup diya
 Beginning the discussion, Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Arun Jaitley said that the bill is weak but the House should not step back without passing an effective Lokpal Bill
 jetali ne sarkaar se kaha ki yadi vah vidheyak ko ucch sadan main paarit karana chaahati he to use bhaajapa ke sanshodhano ko sweekaar kar lenaa chahie
 At the same time, Singhvi dismissed Jaitley's allegations and asked that the fundamental question is whether you want to pass the Lokpal Bill or not? sadan main sarkaar kaa paksh rakhte hue singhvi ne bhaajapa kaa is mudde par rukh spasht nahin hone kaa bhi aarope lagaaya
 Satish Chandra Mishra of Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) said that the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) should not be under the government
 jabaki marxvaadi communist party (makapa) ke netaa seetaram yechuri ne pesh vidheyak ko kamjor bataaya
 At the same time, Prashant Bhushan, a prominent member of Team Anna and senior advocate of the Supreme Court, said, "from what i have seen during the discussion in Rajya Sabha, i do not think that the Lokpal Bill will be passed
 " To give relief to the farmers in Chhattisgarh, it has been decided to close small branches of cooperative banks
 isaki jagah micro ATM kii suvidha gaanv-gaanv main uplabdh karai jaaegi
 264 branches of cooperative banks across the state will be closed and transformed into a single schedule cooperative bank
 rajya stareey bank khulne se kisaanon ke karj main dedh se do fisadi tak kii kami aegi
 It is being said that doing so will prevent the expenses and misconduct of all branches
 yahi nahin rajya sarkaar ko byaaj anudaan main chalis se pachaas karod rupye kii salanaa bachat bhi hogi
 The share capital of the farmers in the bank operations will also be reduced by five per cent
 gauratlab he ki chhattisgarh cabinet main sahakaari bainko ke sanshodhan ko manjuuri de di gai he
 Chief Minister Raman Singh has described it as a relief move in the interest of farmers
 unhone kaha he ki ekarajya stareey bankban jane se kisaan ab rajya ke kisi bhi sahakaari bank se lenden kar sakenge
 He informed that there will be merger of employees of cooperative banks working in small village towns
 is sansodhan se kisaanon ko byajdaron se lekar ansh puunji tak kaa phayda hoga
 With this, villages and towns will also come under the micro ATM facility
 isamen rajya sahakaari bainkon das hajaar karod kikaryashil puunjika phayda mil sakegaa
 Now it has to be seen whether the general public will really be able to take advantage of it or it will remain only in the papers

 Amidst the uproar in the Lok Sabha, there was an interesting view on Monday
 jab raashtrapati ke abhibhaashan par charchaa ke dauraan congress netaa mallikarjun khadge kii baat par achaanak piem modi hans die
 Actually, Congress leader in the House Mallikarjun Kharge was in an aggressive mood regarding the plans of the Modi government
 khadge ne kaha ki piem ne kaha tha ki ek lakh karod main ahmedabad se mumbai bullate train aegi
 No bullet train in 2 years
 ek saal main 62 baar train direl hui he
 Nothing was done in the budget to stop the accident
 khadge ne iske baad kaha ki 'aapkaa to aisa he ki aapkaa prem mere se he or shaadi kisi or se he
 PM Modi laughed at this matter of Kharge
 baaki ratna kahaan hankhadge ne kaha ki sargical strike ke baad modi ji ne kaha ki jaise akbar ke darbar main saat ratna the, aise mere ratna manohar parrikar hai
 If Parrikar is Raja Man Singh, Jaitley Todarmal, then where are the other gems? Kharge's dastardly attack: Kharge fiercely attacked the Modi government 
 khadge ne kaha ki modi sarkaar ne desh se jhuthe daawey kiye
 This government is only fast in speech
 khadge ne poocha- bullate train kaa kya hua? rail haadason par sarkaar ko jawaab dena chahie
 Earlier the government made fun of MNREGA but now its budget has been increased
 isse pehle, kendriya mantri mahesh sharma ne notebandi ke faisle kaa bachaav kiya
 Mahesh Sharma said that this government has taken big and bold decisions to change the picture of the country
 mahesh sharma ne kaha ki saahasik faislon ke liye 56 inch kaa seenaa chahie hota he or is sarkaar ne kabhi bhi kade faislon se munh nahin modaa he
 Demonetisation is a wrong decision
 Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge said in the Lok Sabha that no one can speak at this time in the country
 apane tareeke se rah nahin saktaa
 Because at this time there is undeclared emergency in the country
 khadge ne raashtrapati ke abhibhaashan par charchaa ke dauraan kaha kii notebandi kaa faisla thik nahin tha
 This caused a lot of trouble to the common man, farmers suffered
 chote vyapaariyon ko nuksaan hua
 This is not the case in any country
 kahin bhi nahin he ki apane hi paise nikaalane ke logon ko line main laganaa pade
 But if the government had to decide demonetisation, it should have been done with complete preparation
 taiyaari kyon nahin kii gai? modi sarkaar har maamle main fail he
 Whether it is the case of farmers, the case of MNREGA, the railways have also failed
 modi ji keval bhaashan karnaa jaanate hai
 Speech does not fill your stomach
 desh main aghoshit immergencicongress netaa mallikarjun khadge ne loksabhaa main kaha ki desh main is vakt koi apni baat nahin rakh saktaa, apane tareeke se rah nahin saktaa, kyonki is vakt desh main aghoshit immergency he
 He said, 'we wanted to discuss the closure of the note
 aaj bhi taiyaar hai, lekin yah sarkaar charchaa nahin karnaa chaahati thi
 The Congress leader said that after the coming of this government, farmers are very upset, suicide has increased
 unako apni fasal kaa uchit mulya nahin miltaa he
 Growth has not increased in agriculture
 congress ne bachaaya prajatantr, isliye PM ban paae modipichley 60- 70 saal main congress ne kuch nahin kiya is aarope par bolte hue mallikarjun khadge ne kaha ki 70 saal main congress ne hi prajatantr ko bachaaya he
 The Constitution is saved
 lekin aap log desh ko todna chaahate hai, tod rahe hai
 Had the Congress not protected the Constitution and democracy, Narendra Modi would not have become the Prime Minister of the country, that is why he could get out of the common family and become the Prime Minister of the country
 khadge ne kaha ki bijepi ne desh ke liye qurbaani nahin di, shahadat nahin di, jabaki congress main chaahe vah indira gandhi ho yaa rajeev gandhi, bahut se logon ne shahadat di he
 Mahesh Sharma said these important things in the Lok Sabha - in two years 11 thousand villages got electricity
 -jandhan yojana ke jariye logon ko banking system main shaamil kiya gaya
 - Big decisions require a 56 inch chest and a beating heart behind it
 or uski jiti jaagti misaal hamaare pradhanmantri modi hai
 Our government implemented One Rank One Pension
 -hamaari sarkaar ne drudh ichhashakti ke saath sargical strike ko anjaam diya
 You have asked for heroic evidence from heroic evidence
 -aath november ko kaale dhan par chot kii
 PM has attacked corrupt leaders
 -24 ghante main logon ke paas nai karency mil gai
 The people of the whole country stood with PM Modi

 mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne buudhvaar ko kaha ki is niyam kii jad main varisht adhikariyon se lekar mantri or naukarshah sabhi honge
 The Chief Minister said, 'formulas of operating even and odd cars will be applicable to all people
 phir chaahe vah koi varisht adhikari ho, mantri hon yaa naukarshah
 Yes, vehicles such as ambulances and PCR will be exempted from this
 'rajnath singh se mili kejarivaldilli main sam-visham ke formule ko lekar mukhyamantri kejariwal ne buudhvaar ko kendriya grih mantri rajnath singh se bhi mulaakaat kii
 After talking to Singh, the CM said, 'the meeting was cordial and cooperative
 grih mantri ne trephic ko lekar kuch nae muddon kii charchaa kii, jinamein immergency sarvice, akeli mahila dwaara driving kii sthiti, ambulance yaa marijon ko le ja rahi gadiyon ko lekar baat hui
 We told them that we are considering several options in this direction
 ' kejariwal ne bataaya ki unhone grih mantri se kaha ki vaayu pradooshan ke khilaaf is puri muhim main dilli sarkaar ko dilli police kaa sahyog chahie
 Talk about CCTV cameras The Chief Minister said that during the discussion with the Home Minister, there was also talk about installation of CCTV cameras in the city
 kejariwal ne kaha, 'hamane unase kaha ki is kaam main bhi hamen dilli police kaa puraa sahyog chahie, kyonki sisitivi footage kaa acces police ke paas hi hoga
 When questioned about the criticism of the formula, Kejriwal said that the state government has two options to either implement the scheme now or continue planning for two-three years
 subah 8 baje se shaam 8 baje takadilli main badhate pradooshan ko rokane ke liye dilli sarkaar sam-visham kaaron ke parichaalan ko lekar jo yojana lekar ai he, uske tahat ravivaar ko chhodkar hafte ke baaki din subah 8 baje se shaam 8 baje tak rajdhani kii sadakon par number or taarikh ke hisaab se gaadiyaan chalengi

 agar aapane ujin poli kii mrityu kii khabar ko dekhne ke liye 20 may yaa uske baad se apane remote control kaa istemaal karke tivi channelon ko badla ho, to aapako zyada kuch nahin mila hoga
 Eugene Polly invented the first wireless TV remote flashmatic in 1955

 But Polly, discovering this small device with many buttons, rushed on the couch and prepared a generation of channel changeers
 us peedi ko apane baithne kii jagah or tivi ke faasale ko mitaane kaa saadhan mil gaya
 Since 1955 there have been several incarnations of the TV remote, Polly used the lights seen in his remote
 iske baad remote main infrared, radio tarang or ultrasound takneekon ko apanaaya gaya
 Nowadays most remote infrared rays are used
 jab aap remote kaa koi batan dabaate hai, jaise aawaaj badhaane kaa batan, to infrared kirane kaaphi teji se jalati-bujhti hai
 This instructs the binary code receiver mounted on the TV to amplify the sound, nowadays most of the consumer electronic items come with the remote
 in upkarnon kii sankhya itani bad gai ki inke liye ek samoohvachak sangya kii jarurat mahasoos hone lagi
 Someone (actually Philips) thought of making a single universal remote for many electronic items, couch-bound people would be grateful that the same remote is now being used to run tvs, DVD players and air conditioners for everyone

 ye tivi set haath ke sanketon, bole hue nirdeshon or chehre ke haav-bhav se chalate hai
 To activate the tv's voice control you just have to say, 'hi TV
 ' ji haa, or agar aapako apane tivi se baaten karnaa ajeeb lage, to behatar he ki aap channel badalane ke liye yaa phir program menu tak pahunchane ke liye apane tivi ke saamne baith jaaen or haath hilaakar use sanket den
 a program of voice recognition and a camera that can understand the movements of your hands can do many such tasks, which now remotely do your work
 abhi or bhi bahut ku chha aana baaki he
 "we hope that this technology will be used in our other products as well," says a Samsung official
 '' to shaayad ham aage dekh sakate hai ki blue-re player, airkandishnar, refricrator or mujic player jaisi kai chijen hamaare bolne yaa haath hilaane se kaam karen
 In an industry where better than one discovery leads to another search, you can be sure that other companies will start promoting products even remotely

 haalanki aisa bahut jaldi nahin hoga
 As a Samsung official says, "there is a large population that does not have access to these premium products
" lihaaja, remote aam logon ke liye pesh samsung utpaadon kaa ek jaruri hissaa bana rahegaa
 "samsung's new TV will also require your loyal remote in addition to voice instructions for some functions, such as going to the Samsung Apps category

 arvind vashishtha lambey samay se is baat kii taiyaari kar rahe the ki nikaay chunaav aaenge to bundelkhand ke iklaute nagar nigam jhaansi ke mahayor pad par ve daavedaari thokenge
 Just before the election notification was issued, they filled the city with their posters and banners
 lekin jab adhisuchana saamne ai to jhansi kya, bundelkhand ke sabhi saat jilon ke saare nagar nikaayon yani ek nagar nigam, 18 nagarpalika or 30 nagar panchayaton ke adhyaksh pad ko arakshit kar diya gaya
 This is the first time since independence, when the participation of upper caste people in the municipal bodies of the politically sensitive Bundelkhand has been almost completely eradicated
 puure ilaake kii siten arakshit ho jane kaa faisla chaunkaane vaala rahaa
 Especially when the Mayawati government had already indicated to normalize the Jhansi Municipal Corporation seat
 vashishtha kehete hai, ''meri ichha thi ki apane pita biharilal vashishtha kii tarah main bhi ek baar jhaansi kaa meyar banuun
 But the dream broke
 '' aisa hi jhatka congress ke bhanu sahay ko bhi laga he
 Sahay said, "my Baba, Dada and Tau continued to occupy Jhansi
" lekin lagata he ki ab saamaanya varg ke logon ke liye nikaay kii raajnneeti karne ke daravaaje hameshaa ke liye band ho gaye hai
 There is also a solid foundation for the twins of upper caste leaders
 jhaansi nagar nigam ke ilaake kii aabaadi 5,07,000 he, jisamen savarna kareeb 60 fisadi, pichde 21 tathaa anusuchit jati 19 fisadi hai
 Hargovind Kushwaha, former chairman of the Jhansi Development Authority, says that since 1994, Jhansi seat has been continuously kept for the Scheduled Castes, whereas the upper castes are more here
 bundelkhand ke baaki jilon lalitpur, jalon, hamirpur, mahoba, banda or chitrakoot main bhi yahi haal he
 Nine seats in the Pan Municipality and seven Nagar Panchayats of Jhansi district are for Scheduled Castes (SC), out of which five will be SC women candidates
 jhaansi nagar nigam kii seat bhi lagaataar chauthi baar anusuchit jati kii mahila ke liye arakshit rakhi gai he
 There are only five seats in seven districts, which are reserved for the women category i
e
 women candidates of general category can also contest from here
 sabase zyada 27 siten anusuchit jati ke logon ke khate main gai hai
 In Bundelkhand's 30 Nagar Panchayats, six seats have been reserved for Scheduled Caste Women, 12 for Scheduled Castes, seven for Backward Classes, three for Backward Class Women and two for Women
 nagarpalika kii 18 siton main anusuchit jati mahila ke liye teen, anusuchit jati ke liye paanch, pichhadaa varg ke liye teen, pichhadaa varg mahila ke liye chaar tathaa mahila varg ke liye teen siten arakshit shrenee main rakhi gai hai
 In the last five-year period, nine seats of Bundelkhand were unreserved, on which seven people of the upper caste were able to win the election
 bundelkhand ke savarnon ko is baat par etraj he ki aakhir kis niyam ke tahat sabhi siton ko arakshit kar diya gaya he
 Interestingly, mlas and mps of the general castes of the area, irrespective of their caste, are not ready to speak officially on the issue
 jhaansi ke bhaajapa vidhayak ravi kumaar sharma or banda sadar se congress vidhayak vivek singh ne aarakshan ke mudde par kisi tarah kii tippanee karne se inkaar kar diya
 The leaders of SP and BSP are also keeping silence on this matter
 partiyon ko bakhubi pataa he ki nikaay chunaavon kaa jati sameekaran vidhansabha or loksabhaa chunaav se ekadam ulat he
 In such a situation, there is no such thing that can prove to be a sore throat for them in big elections for immediate benefit

 uddyan mantri ne kaha, "air india ke saamne kai samasyaayein hai, inamen se vimaanon kii kami pramukh he
 Apart from this, the matter of determination of fare as compared to the route and private airports has to be seen
 " unhone kaha, "uddyan kshetra main nijee kshetra kii bhoomika mahatvapurn he or sarkaar unhen hatotsahit nahin karegi
 "it is noteworthy that National Aviation Company of India Air India incurred a loss of Rs 5551 crore in the year 2009-10 and Rs 7189 crore in the previous year

 Tirath said that DAVP keeps a close eye on them before the advertisement is released
 usee samay unhone yah bhi kaha ki pakistan ke purv vaayu sena pramukh kii tasviir ke saath koi naam nahin diya gaya he
 Pointing out that this advertisement was released by mistake, he said that it is a photograph of an officer in uniform and no name was given
 sagar kii surakhividhansabhasit abhi bijepi ke paas he
 The MLA here is Parul Sahu
 pichley chunaav main unhone congress ke diggaj netaa govindsingh rajput ko haraaya tha
 However, this time it is being said that Parul Sahu will not contest

 wo chunari yatra jaise saamaajik sarokaar ormukhyamantridvara kshetra main kii gai ghoshnaaon ke aadhaar par hue kaamon ko lekar janata ke bich pahchaan banaae hue hai
 The interesting thing about the last election held on this seat is that in the 2013 assembly elections, the margin of defeat between the two candidates was only 141 votes
 yahi kaaran he ki congress ko is seat par dobaaraa jeet kaa bharosa he
 At the same time, this time the Congress will definitely want to field strong candidates from the BSP area because it can benefit them
 is seat par koi khaas jaateey sameekaran asardaar nahin hota he
 The voters of all the classes here contribute to the victory of the candidate
 yahi kaaran he ki surakhi se bahari pratyaashee chaahe vah congress ke hon yaa bhaajapa yaa phir janata party ke jitate aae hai

 is kadam kaa santon ne swaagat kiya lekin ram mandir par koi elaan na karne par naaraazgi jaahir kii he
 Saints say that Yogi did not say anything on the Ram temple, which crores of Hindus were waiting for
 sant paramhans ne to chetavanee dete hue kaha he ki agar 6 disambar tak ram mandir nirmaan ke sambandh main koi faisla nahin hua to khud ko aag lagaakar jivan kaa balidaan de denge
 Yogi had said that he would give good news on Diwali, in view of the saints' displeasure after the hearing of the Ayodhya issue in the Supreme Court, UP CM Yogi Aditya Nath had said that he will be taking the good news in Ayodhya on Diwali
 dilli main yojit santon ke sammelan ke sambandh main unhone kaha tha ki dilli main nahin ayodhya chaliye vahaan khabar lekar aa rahaa hum
 After this, speculations began to be made as to what the yogis would announce there
 aisa bataaya gaya ki sarayu ke kinare 151 meter oonchi tambe kii murti banaai jaaegi
 But Yogi himself did not make this statement
 haa sant samaaj kii pratikriya jarur aa gai ki ham bhavy ram mandir kaa intjaar kar rahe hai murti kaa nahin
 Build the temple, it seemed that the eyes of the common people were on Ayodhya on Tuesday
 aisa mana ja rahaa tha ki yogi jarur koi aisi ghoshnaa karenge jisase ram mandir kii raah aasaan hogi yaa usase judi hogi
 Even before they reached the stage, slogans were raised that Yogi ji should 'build the temple'
 yogi ne jab apana bhaashan chaalu kiya to naaron kii aawaaj or tej ho gai
 CM welcomed all the dignitaries, after which he spoke on Ayodhya, he said to change the name of Faizabad to Ayodhya, asked to rename the medical college after Dasaratha, talked about renaming the airport after Ram, Ayodhya He kept talking about development but did not utter a word on the Ram temple
 jansamooh ko baar-baar lagata rahaa ki ab kuch mahatvapurn ghoshnaa hone vaala he
 The voice of the slogans continued to be loud and low, but people felt disappointed
 yogi ne ek jatke main apana bhaashan khatm kar diya or jaakar kursi par baith gaye
 The saint's patience was broken, the saint-mahant, waiting for a big announcement, was upset with it
 ram janm bhoomi ke mukhya pujari mahant satyendra das ne kaha ki 'faijabad kaa naam ayodhya karne ke yogi ke faisle kaa ham swaagat karte hai
 But we expected him to tell us when the ordinance for the Ram temple is being brought in Parliament
 centre sarkaar ko kuch karnaa chahie jisase bhagwaan ram kaa bhavy mandir ayodhya main banaaya ja sake'
 i will set myself on fire - Mahant Paramhansa Similarly Mahant Paramhans said that it is good that Faizabad's name was changed but what happened about the promise of Ram temple with the help of which the BJP came to power
 siem ne apane bhaashan main iskaa zikr tak nahin kiya
 If the date for the temple construction is not announced till December 6, i will end my life by setting myself on fire '
 bhaajapa sarkaar se ummidenkhil bhartiya sant samiti ke rajya adhyaksh mahant gauri shankar das ne kaha ki 'ayodhya ko ek airport or ek medical college milanaa acha he lekin ram mandir nirmaan ke vaade kaa kya hua'
 He further explained that there was a large gathering of saints
 isamen maang kii gai thi kanoon banaakar mandir kaa nirmaan kiya jaae, kyonki ham aisa maanate hai ki bhaajapa sarkaar hi aisa kar sakati he
 Santasutras to meet Amit Shah told India Today that people of Sant Samaj will meet BJP President Amit Shah after December 16 to demand construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya
 unase maang kii jaaegi ki sansad main kanoon banaakar mandir kaa nirmaan kiya jaae
 During the entire speech of Yogi, there was a voice from the crowd that build the temple
 lekin yogi apane puure bhaashan main yah vishwaas dilaate rahe ki ayodhya ke saath anyaay nahin hone diya jayega or sarkaar puure ayodhya ke vikaas ke liye patibadd he
 Yogi made 3 major announcements
 Yogi announced that now Faizabad will be named Ayodhya
 yahaan par jo medical college banaaya ja rahaa he uskaa naam raja dasharath ke naam par rakhaa jayega
 The third airport to be built in Ayodhya will be named after God
 unhone daawa kiya ki ayodhya main vikaas ke kai kaam karaae gaye hai or ab koi bhi ayodhya ke saath anyaay nahin kar saktaa

 bihar ke upmukhyamantri evam vittamantri susheel kumaar modi ne kaha ki krishi laagat evam mulya ayog ko sanvaidhanik sanstha ke rup main manyata di jaani chahie
 Addressing the inter-state workshop of six states held here today under the aegis of Bihar Pradesh BJP Kisan Morcha regarding paddy production cost estimation, Modi said that the Agricultural Cost Price Commission should be recognized as a constitutional or statutory institution 
 unhone kaha ki bharat sarkaar ke krishi mantralay ke adheen sankhyaki vibhaag desh ke lagbhag aath hajaar kisaanon ke ek maheene kii laagat ko sangrah karke uske aadhaar par apni anushansa krishi laagat mulya ayog ko bhejte hai or uski sifarish ke aadhaar par kendriya mantrimandal anaaj ke nunatam samarthan mulya par nirnay leti he
 Modi said that the BJP Kisan Morcha should also demand from the Central Government to make public the basis of the minimum support price fixed for any agricultural produce
 unhone kaha ki jis prakaar se vitt ayog kii anushansa ko maanane ke liye bharat sarkaar baadhya hoti he usee prakaar se krishi laagat mulya ayog kii sifarish ko maanane ke liye baadhya haani chaiye
 Modi said that while accusing the Center of fixing the minimum support price for foodgrains at a lower cost than the cost of farmers, he said that today, except for urea fertilizer, all other fertilizers have been removed by the central government, which results It has happened that their value has more than doubled
 bihar ke upmukhyamantri susheel kumaar modi ne kaha ki yahi nahin ab bharat sarkaar bahut jald dijal ko bhi apane niyantran se baahar karne ja rahi he aise main aane vaale dinon main dijal ke bhi daam badhenge
 He said that in Bihar, where eighty percent of the farmers are cultivating diesel based due to lack of electricity, in the event that the government control over it will affect the cost price of the farmer in growing a crop
 modi ne kaha ki pichley saal bihar main 70 lakh metric ton dhan kaa utpaadan hua jo ab tak kaa ricard utpaadan he or nai-nai takanic se isaki utpaadakta bhi bad gayi he

 He said that on the one hand the food crisis in the country keeps hovering, on the other hand, the farmers do not get the right price for their products due to the lifting of the food grains produced and their proper storage
 modi ne kaha ki yah vidambnaa he ki krishi pradhan is desh main bank car aadi vilaasta kii vastu par kam byaaj dar par rin uplabdh karaate hai vahiin kisaanon ko unako upkaran kharidne ke liye liye die gaye rin par bainkon ko unchi byaaj dar kaa bhugtan karnaa padataa he
 Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi said that the farmer cannot increase his income by producing only food grains, so till the farmer produces fruits, vegetables including fish, poultry, bee keeping, he cannot be self-sufficient
 unhone kaha ki krishi se judi sabhi vidhaon par milane vaale bank rin par byaaj dar ko ek samaan kiya janaa chahie
 Addressing the workshop, Bihar Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh demanded not only the minimum support price of his products but also the remunerative prices to the farmers and said that for this, farmers have to fight a long battle with awareness

 ravivaar kii subah-subah padosiyon ne jab parivaar ke sabhi sadasyon ko ghar main mara padaa dekha to ilaake main hadakamp much gaya
 Police said the body of a 75-year-old female Naraina, the oldest member of the house, was found lying on the floor
 aisa lag rahaa he ki unki galaa dabaakar hatya kii gai he
 While the bodies of the remaining 10 members were found hanging in a trap from the railings
 kuch sadasyon ke haath-pair bandhe hue the, jabaki kuch sadasyon ke aankh par pattee bandhi hui thi
 Naraina lived in this house for the past 23 years with a family of his widowed daughter and two sons
 unke donon bete makaan ke nichle hisse main doodh, plaiwood or kiraane kii dukaane chalaate the
 At around 6 in the morning, the milk supplier kept the crate of milk, but when no one came from inside the house, his neighbor named Gurcharan Singh went to see the house
 gurcharan ghar ke andar jab pehali manzil par pahunche to vahaan ghar ke sabhi sadasyon ko mara paaya
 He informed other neighbors and the police was also informed
 police ne bataaya ki ghar kaa bahari darwaja khulaa hua tha
 The family also kept a dog, which was found tied to the roof
 ab police ke saamne yah puraa maamla ek gutthi ban gaya he
 From the evidence coming out from the scene, it is becoming very difficult to understand whether the whole incident is suicide or murder
 police ke saamne ab ye 13 sabase ahm sawaal hai, jinhen dhundne main vah lagi hui he-:1
 Who killed the elderly woman and why? ghar kaa mukhya daravaja kyon khulaa tha yaa kisne kholaa?3
 If there was no looting in the house, was the elderly woman killed by a member or close of the house? 4
 agar baaki 10 logon ne aatmahatya kii to kis vajah se?5
 So many people committed suicide so why no suicide note was found in the house? 6
 ghar ke halaat or gale main lataki chunni ishaara kar rahi he ki parivaar kaaphi dharmik pravriti kaa tha
 Will Raj open from post mortem only! 7
 agar ghar main ek katl hua yaa koi bahari aayaa to kutta bhunkaa kyon nahin?8
 The dog was tied on the roof at the exact spot where the dead bodies were found hanging from the webs
 9
 a lot of cash was found in the house, but no one stole it
 10
 Why were the hands and feet and mouth of all the dead bodies hanging from the railing tied and tied? kuch bacchon ke pair jameen se tach bhi ho rahe hai
 So was he murdered and hanged, so that he would also commit suicide? 12
 sabhi ne ghar main ek hi jagah khudakushi kii, vah bhi aasapaas hi latakkar
 Meaning, i was not afraid to see someone dying
 13
 The special thing is that all of them met with their faces facing each other
 shav dekhakar saaf andaja lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Meaning why did everyone commit suicide in view of each other's faces? Know that in this case every UPDATE, however, the police have sent the dead bodies for postmortem and sealed the entire house

 bijepi se maidan main hai aditya chautalanaina chautaala hai nivartmaan vidhayakaharyana kii siyasat ne 2019 main karavat lee he
 The reputation of the family is at stake in the assembly elections, which are going to be held for the first time after the dissolution of the Chautala family, which was once the head of state politics, also of the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) of Omprakash Chautala, the heir of the political legacy of Tochodhari Devi Lalki
 aise main kuch siton kii jang rochak ho gai he
 Dabwali Assembly Constituency in Sirsa district, once a Congress stronghold, is also included in this list, where the Chautala family and the INLD have dominated the past few years
 chaar chunaavon se yah seat ieneldi ke kabje main hi rahi he
 However, in the changed environment this time, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party has also put the Chautala card game INLD into the fold
 choudhary devilal ke parivaar kii paramparaagat siton main gini jane vaali dabwaali seat par 2014 main tisare number par rahi bijepi ne unheen ke chote bete jagadish ke putr aditya chautaala ko chunaav maidan main utaara he
 Naina Singh Chautala is an MLA
 INLD gave the ticket to Naina Singh Chautala, wife of Ajay Singh Chautala, son of former Chief Minister Omprakash Chautala, from this seat in 2014
 saansad rahe dushyant singh kii maa naina chunaav jeet kar vidhansabha bhi pahunchin, lekin ab vah ieneldi se nikaale jane ke baad pati or putr ke banaae daljananaayak janata party (jejepi)main hai
 After the candidature of Aditya Chautala from Dabwali, Naina Chautala is trying her luck in Badlada seat instead of this seat
 bijepi ke chautaala ko chunauti dene ke liye ieneldi ne doctor seetaram, jejepi ne doctor sarbajit singh masita or congress ne amit sihaag par daanv lagaaya he
 What is the political past of Dabwali? If we talk about the political past of Dabwali, then it was also the Congress stronghold
 san 1967 main hue pehle vidhansabha chunaav main congress ke kesara ram vijayi hue the
 This seat, under the influence of Chaudhary Devi Lal, was gradually transformed into a party stronghold after the INLD came into existence
 purv mukhyamantri omprakash chautaala ke putr abhaya singh chautaala bhi is seat kaa pratinidhitiv kar chuke hai
 Will Gul feed the bjp's Chautala card? Everyone is eyeing this seat in Haryana, situated on the border with Rajasthan and Punjab
 bijepi ke chautaala card khilne ke baad naina ne parivaar ke sadasyon ke bich siyaasi jang taalane ke liye apni seat badal lee
 It remains to be seen whether Aditya will be able to end the supremacy of the Chautalas and feed Lotus or get entangled in the political siege of INLD

 upi chunaav main musalamaanon ke saamne phir ek badi duvidha khadi ho gai he ki wo kise vot den
 But there is no dilemma about who to defeat in this election
 musalmaan votaron kaa mul mantra he,jo bijepi ko haraayega vahi muslim vot paaegaa
 As such, the Samajwadi Party has been the first to want Muslims for the last two and a half decades
 lekin centre main modi sarkaar kii maujuudagi or lagaataar badhati sampradayik maahaul ne musalamaanon ko sochane par majaboor kar diya he
 Who will get the votes of the Muslims? Samajwadi Party has tried to give a strong alternative to the Muslims by tying up with the Congress, so that the dilemma of the Muslims can be ended and they get a united 20 percent Muslim vote so that these people can touch the majority figure
 
 par jamini hakeekat yah he ki musalmaan banta hua he, khaskar musalamaanon ke garh pashchimi or purvi upi main musalmaan abtak tay nahin kar paa rahe ki unka ekajute vot kahaan jaae
 But there is also a fact that most Muslims are preferring Akhilesh's government
 musalamaanon ke vot ke bagaiyr jeet mushkilpure uttar pradesh main kareeb 130 se 135 aisi siten he jahaan musalmaan haar-jeet sidhe-sidhe tay karata he jisamen zyaadaatar siten pashchimi upi, tarai vaale ilaake or purvi uttar pradesh he
 It is difficult for anyone to win without the votes of Muslims
 akhilesh se naraj hai musalamanyun to musalamaanon kaa ek bada varg akhilesh sarkaar se mujffarnagar dangon ke baad se hi naaraaz tha, musalamaanon main naaraazgi kii badi vajah lav jihad, kairana palaayan or dharmantaran ko lekar bhi thi or khaskar jat- musalmaan dangon ne to akhilesh yadav se musalamaanon ko puri tarah alag kar diya tha
 For some time, the Muslim and Samajwadi Party's base had become a bit weak in western UP, but the Muslim had shifted to BSP instead of Samajwadi Party, but now that Samajwadi Party has aligned with Congress, now the picture can change is
 badal gayi hai samikarnapashchimi uttar pradesh main mujffarnagar, saharanpur, meerut,bagpat, hapur or gajiabad jaisi siton par ab sameekaran badalte dikh rahe hai or musalamaanon kaa zyada bada tabaka akhilesh or congress kii taraf ja saktaa he
 But all Muslims are adding one thing that even if they are supporters of SP and Congress, whoever defeats BJP in the last phase, will be turned towards Muslim
 aise main kai siton par musalmaan bispi ke saath jayega
 For example, most of the Muslims of Meerut are in favor of the sp-congress
 lekin haji yaqub kii seat par musalmaan bispi ko vot karegaa
 In many reserved seats where the VSP is strong, Muslims can also go towards the BSP

 The Congress and other opposition parties objected to some provisions of GST, but the government did not consider them
 unhone kaha ki kisi galat bill ke paas hone se acha he ki vah sansad main lambit rahe
 Chidambaram said that the government was not in a position to achieve the revenue deficit target
 unhone kaha ki endie ne chunaav ke dauraan zyada naukariyon, epadiai main badhottaree or aadharbhoot dhaanche main tej badhat kaa vaada kiya tha, jo ki puraa nahin hua

 His intention was something else

 Only a few top top officers of Shivhar jail knew about this arrangement

 The officials of the Shivhar jail tried hard to hide this but they could not succeed in it

 Many habitual criminals, after committing the crime, reach the courts to surrender
 iskaa matlab saaf taur par yah he ki unhen idhar-udhar bhatakane kii bajaae jele zyada surakshit lagati hai
 And why not? While prisons are safe havens, surrender does not even attach to their property and it is easy to get bail later

 ' isamen pehle vikalp ko 70 pratishat or duusare vikalp ko 30 pratishat vot mili
 Taunting Sirsa, AAP spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj said on Wednesday that it was a good thing that the BJP MLA conducted the survey
 isse pataa chalata he ki bhagava party ke samarthak bhi agle varsh hone vaale dilli vidhansabha chunaav main aap ko vot dena chaahate hai
 Sirsa's 'twitter poll' strengthened Kejriwal's side
 surveykshan main shaamil hue 70 pratishat pratibhaagiyon ne mukhyamantri kejariwal ke paksh main vot kiya jabaki 30 pratishat ne unke khilaaf vot kiya
 However, Sirsa claimed that the survey was rigged by AAP workers
 unhone buudhvaar ko ek twit main kaha, ‘‘kejariwal ke paksh main matdaan ke liye aap kii iti cell ko badhai
 If this was the ground reality, AAP would have won the Lok Sabha elections
 ''AAP IT Cell ko jeet kii badhai @ankitlal i wish @arvindkejriwal would be popular on the ground as well, or why would AAP come third on 48 out of 70 Asmb seats in LS elections? bhaade ke Staff se Twitter poll main vot karvaa ke tum kejariwal kii naakamayaabi or dilliwaalo kaa “aap” se gussa chupa nahin sakate https: / / t

 Panic spread in the area after an unclaimed bag was found outside the BJP headquarters on Ashoka Road this morning
 police ko is bag ke bare main soochna subah lagbhag 8 baje mili
 Police rushed to the spot carrying bomb disposal squad and search dogs
 jaanchakartaaon ko bag main kuch bhi sandigdh nahin mila
 Meanwhile, a couple, claiming to be BJP workers, reached there and said that the bag belonged to them
 atirikt police ayukta (nai dilli) esbs tyaagi ne kaha, dampati ne bag bhaajapa mukhyalay par rakhaa tha or khud ve kuch khaane ke liye paas ke andhra bhawan main gaye the
 Then someone called PCR about the unclaimed bag
 unhone kaha, pati or patni ko poochtacha ke liye police chaowkee laayaa gaya tha
 Police said prima facie nothing serious seems to be going on in this case, but they are investigating the case

 centre kii fasal beemaa yojana par bhi nitish ne kaha ki yah kisaan ke hit main nahin, beemaa company ke laabh ke liye hai
 Nitish repeatedly said that he has no addiction to liquor arrest, he has the addiction to fulfill his promise
 modi sarkaar ne naagarikta sanshodhan bill ko lok sabha main paas kara liya he
 Under its provision, Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Parsis and Christians persecuted in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan can be granted citizenship after six years of stay in India, which came to India before 31 December 2014
 bangladeshi ghuspaith ko lekar bijepi kii jo bhi samaj rahi ho magar assam ke log sabhi avaidh bangladeshi ke kilaaf hai
 Both Hindu and Muslim
 magar yah bill agar kanoon bana to hindu bangladeshi ko naagarikta mil jaaegi
 Due to this , the organizations of different societies in many states like Assam Manipur, Sikkim, Tripura have become apprehensive and uniting to protest against the Citizenship Amendment Bill 
 is bill ne avaidh ghuspaith ko dharm ke aadhaar par baant diya he
 Bangladeshi Muslims will be considered illegal but Bangladeshi Hindu infiltrators will be treated as citizenship
 bharat ke samvidhan main naagarikta dene kaa praavdhaan he lekin wo gharm ke aadhaar nahin he
 Bangladeshi Hindu or Muslim could be granted citizenship while meeting the conditions of those provisions
 lekin ek secular desh main aisa kanoon bana he jisamen sirf ek mazahab ko baahar kar diya gaya he
 The new bill also clearly states the country with religion
 ham nahin jaanate ki in faislon se aane vaale dinon main pakistan, bangladesh or afghanistan main rahane vaale sikh or hindu alpsankhyakon par kya asar padegaa? bahumat ke dam par is tarah kaa vargeekaran bijepi hi kar sakati he kyonki use yakeen he ki hindu ke naam par vah kuch bhi karegi to uske sahi galat par vichaar karne ke liye hindu apana dimaag nahin lagaayenge
 Due to this disease of the politics of Hindu nation, insecurity has spread in the tribal communities of Northeast
 yahaan ke logon ne bijepi par apana ekamusth bharosa kaayam kiya tha magar naagarikta sanshodhan bill ke kaaran assam, manipur, tripura sahit purvottar main aabaadi or asmita kaa sawaal phir se khadaa hone laga he
 Illegal is illegal
 ghuspaithiya ghuspaithiya hota he
 It has become the same thing that if the robber who enters the house will be a Muslim, then he will go to jail, but if he is a Hindu, he will not be a robber but heir to your property
 kya yah tark aap sweekaar kar sakate hai? nahin
 The politics of the Sangh Parivar has been the same as that of the Muslim section on Christianity
 muslim aabaadi kaa jhooth failaakar hindu asuraksha paidaa karne kii yah raajnneeti kerala or jharkhand jaise rajyon main isai virodh kaa rup le leti he
 As Christians are converting all Hindus
 acchhee baat he ki bijepi kam se kam isai samaaj ko lekar apni nasamajhi or asuraksha se baahar aa gai he
 Christians from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan can get citizenship in India
 to nepal, srilanka, myanmar ko kyon chhod diya gaya? vahaan bhi to hindu or buddha hai
 However, opposition to the Citizenship Amendment Bill has started in Assam
 virodh karne vaale main ahomia bhi hai or janajaatiy samaaj ke log bhi hai or bharat ke hi bangla bhashi samaaj ke log bhi
 The two allies have split from the Assam government
 assam gana parishad ke teen mantriyon ne sonwal sarkaar kii kursi chhod di he
 The civic organizations of Assam feel that the Citizenship Amendment Bill is a move to settle Hindu Bangladeshis living in Assam
 jab yahi karnaa tha to karodon kharch kar ke neshnal register kaa kaam kyon kiya gaya he
 Is it because Hindu Bangladeshi who are unable to submit their documents in this register should be settled? Whereas people do not see the intrusion divided into Hindu infiltration and Muslim infiltration
 yahi nahin assam kaa bengali samaaj bhi hindu bangladeshiyon ke basane ke kaaran apane astitv par sankat maanane laga he
 So he is also opposing
 is bill ke virodh main sahitya academy puraskaar praapt hiren gohai ne samprabhu assam kii baat kar di, unke khilaaf police ne khud se rashtradroh kaa maamla darj kar diya he
 Not only this, Akhil Gogoi and journalist Manjeet Mahanta have been booked for treason
 pichley saal rajyasabha main bodoland pipuls front ke saansad vishwajit demaari ne bhi kah diya tha ki centre ke is tarah ke raiveye se assam alag ho jayega
 Nobody even took notice then
 grahamantralay ne 1985 ke assam samjhaute ke close 6 ko lagu karne ke liye ek cameti banaai he jiskaa kaam he asamiya samskruti ko badhaava dena, bhashaai pahchaan ko barkaraar rakhana
 Two members of this committee have resigned in protest against the Citizenship Amendment Bill
 assam sahitya sabha ke purv adhyaksh dow
 Nagen Saikia and former president of Assam Sahitya Sabha Rang Bang Tarang and educationist Mukunda Rajwanshi have resigned
 cameti ke sadsy centinal ke purv sampadak dhirendra nath bezebarua ne kaha he ki agar assam kii janata kahegi to ve bhi istipha de denge
 In order to pacify the ongoing protests over the citizenship bill, the central government announced the inclusion of six communities in the list of tribal societies, another fire has erupted
 janajaatiy sanghathan bhi naagarikta sanshodhan bill ke virodh main tha
 Perhaps to divide it, a step was taken to add new tribes to the list of tribal society
 hua bhi yahi
 Tribal organizations opposed to the citizenship bill are now opposing the decision
 unhen lagata he ki aarakshan ke hisse main sendhamari ho rahi he
 If new tribes are to be kept in the scheduled caste then separate reservation should be given for them
 ab iske virodh main assam main 30 ghante ke band kaa aahvaan kiya gaya he
 In Manipur too, the BJP government has confused the state
 2017 main vahaan bhaajapa sarkaar bani thi
 While the Chief Minister of Assam is silent on the Citizenship Amendment Bill, the Chief Minister of Manipur Biren Singh is protesting
 jabaki donon bhaajapa ke hi hai
 Chief Minister Biren Singh has asked the Center to keep Manipur separate from the Citizenship Amendment Bill
 haal hi main manipur ne manipur pipuls protection bill (MPP) paas kiya he, jise manzuri ke liye raashtrapati ke paas bheja gaya he
 The Chief Minister wants the President to sign the bill
 2015 main congress sarkaar ke vakt manipur pipuls protection bill paas hua tha jise pranab mukharzi ne riject kar diya tha
 The BJP government is formed in 2017 and the bill is passed with new amendments
 raashtrapati ne agar is bill ko manzuri di to rajya main bahari logon ko niyamit kiya jane lagegaa
 Manipur was formed in 1972
 uske pehle kai kaarnon se anya log bhi vahaan jaakar based hai
 But now they will get a pass of six months and those who do business will get a maximum license of 5 years
 is bill ke kaaran angrezon kaa banaaya hua system waapas aa jayega jise inner line permit system kehete hai
 Manipur was a part of Assam before it became a separate state in 1972
 1951 se pehle rahane vaale meti, pangal muslim or janajati manipuri maane jaaenge
 Everyone else is non-manipuri
 is kanoon kii adhisuchana jari hone ke ek maheene ke bheetar sabhi gair manipuriyon ko chah maheene ke paas ke liye panjikaran karana hoga
 If an outsider has to go to Manipur, he will need a pass
 manipur main protection bill ko manzuri milane kii ashanka main vahaan based bangla or hindi bhashi asurakshit ho gaye hai
 People who settle there in connection with trade business will also get external status
 is kaaran jiribam ilaake main is bill kaa khub virodh hua he
 There is a statement from the MLA that Manipur is also in India
 yah koi alag desh nahin he
 There are ten thousand Bengalis in Jiribam which have come after 1954
 unki zindagi par asar padegaa
 non-manipuris will not be considered local residents after the bill is passed
 to unke matdaan ke adhikaar par asar padegaa
 What will happen if a similar law is made in Assam
 vahaan bhi to manipuri rahete hai
 Organizations supporting this bill are opposing the Citizenship Amendment Bill
 The All Manipur United Club's Organisation (AMUCO), United Peoples' Front (UPF), Kuki Inpi Manipur (KIM) or North East Indigenous Peoples' Forum (NEIPF) ne logon se ekajute hokar bill kaa virodh karne ke liye kaha he
 This bill is against the indigenous people
 logon ko satark rahanaa chahie
 Jugindras, the leader of the Manipur People's Party, has described it as undemocratic and non-secular
 kaha he ki maujuuda sarkaar kii ranneeti he ki vah in rajyon kii ekta or vividhta ko khatm kar puure desh kaa hindookaran kare
 Like Manipur, Meghalaya Chief Minister Conard Sangma has said that he opposes the Citizenship Amendment bill
 chah maheene pehle jab sansad kii sanyukt samiti ai thi tab bhi is bill kaa virodh kiya tha
 The BJP is supporting the Sangma government of Meghalaya
 sangama sarkaar main bhaajapa ke do mantri bhi hai
 Is bjp's Chief Minister Biren Singh anti-hindu in Manipur? Is Connard Sangma, who became the Chief Minister with the support of BJP, anti-hindu Then what is the BJP doing with them, why is it in alliance? Why is Biren Singh the chief minister of BJP? Proponents of Modi are calling opponents of this bill anti-hindu
 sikkim sarkaar ne naagarikta sanshodhan bill kaa samarthan kiya he
 Due to this, many organizations there have started opposing the government
 tripura main bhi naagarikta sanshodhan bill kaa virodh shuru ho gaya he
 The original tribal population of Tripura is opposed to this
 pashchim tripura ke madhab baari main tribal chaatro ke pradarshnon par tripura police ne goli chalaai he jisase 6 chaatr ghayal ho gaye hai
 All Assam Student Union and North East Student Organization delegation went to Tripura but were not allowed to meet the protesting organizations
 tripura main janajaatiy samaaj kii puraani party IPFT bhi is bill ke virodh main hai
 He is also involved in the BJP government of Tripura
 party ne kaha he ki vah pradarshan to nahin kar rahi he lekin north east student argenigeshan ke band kaa naitik samarthan kiya he
 Now come to Prime Minister Narendra Modi who talks about one Bharat Shrestha Bharat
 itane mahatvapurn masale par kya aapane unki kisi bhoomika ke bare main suna he? kya ve assam, manipur, tripura ke logon se, sanghathanon se koi samvaad karte hue nazar aa rahe hai? kya aapako pathakon ko pataa tha ki narendra modi kii bhaajapa manipur main aisa kanoon banavaa rahi he jiske baad bharat ke logon ko vahaan permit lekar janaa hoga? vahaan rahane ke liye chah maheene kaa paas lenaa hoga? nahin pataa hoga kyonki uttar bharat ke tamaam vivaad uttar bharat ke liye to kodh hai hi, puure bharat ke liye kodh ban gaye hai
 The whole country is busy with Bihar UP
 manipur, tripura or assam kii mul janajaatiy aabaadi kii chintaaen vaazib lagati hai
 It is also understood that these concerns cannot be overcome only at the level of Chief Ministers
 isamen pradhanmantri kii kya bhoomika he? kya ve koi bhoomika nibhaate dikhaai dete hai? pul kaa udyatan karne to chale jate hai, in samasyaon ko dur karne ke jatil kaam main haath kyon nahin daalate? kya isliye ki unhen lagata he ki isse acha raily karo
 It is not my cup of tea
 aachaar samhita lagu karne se pehle sau reliyaan karne main lage pradhanmantri ko kya purvottar ke logon or sanghathanon se baat kar koi nai pahal nahin kerani chahie? kya bharat kii janata ne narendra modi ko reliyaan karne ke liye pradhanmantri chunaa he? reliyon main bhaashan kii taiyaari, aane-jane kaa samay jodakar dekhie ki ve apane saath nyaay kar rahe hai yaa desh ke saath

 In November last year, the Ministry of Human Resource Development decided to discontinue the study of German language as an alternative to Sanskrit and cited 'national interest' for the decision
 germany ne is faisle kii aalochana kii thi

 And if i seek their help, my self-respect will end
 mujhe apane abhinay par puraa bharosa he or main apni kaabiliyat se is kshetra main dhire-dhire aage bad rahi hum
 Sanjay Dutt must have offered you to work in one of his films? i did a film with him
 vah film thi hansmukh pichhal jayega
 It was a very good film

 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne himachal pradesh ke solan main chunavi raily ko sambodhit karte hue piem modi par joardaar hamalaa bolaa
 Taking a dig at PM Modi's radar statement, Rahul Gandhi asked if the airplanes of Air India and other companies disappear when the clouds come? The Congress President said that Modi does not hold press conferences
 wo intervyuu dete hai or unase radar ko lekar or aam kaise khaae jate hai jaise sawaal puch jate hai
 In the press conference, journalists ask me how will run the justice scheme, where will the money come from, how will we provide support price to the farmers
 rahul gandhi ne notebandi ko lekar piem modi par nishaanaa saadhaa
 He said that the Reserve Bank of India has been running the country for 70 years, but PM Modi did not ask him about demonetisation
 modi ne notebandi se jabardast chot maari, vyapaar band ho gaye
 He gave 35 thousand crores to Nirav Modi, got 30 thousand crores to Anil Ambani in Rafael Deal
 is dauraan rahul gandhi ne yah bhi daawa kiya ki notebandi se pehle modi ne cabinet mantriyon ko res course road main kamare main band kar diya tha
 He claimed this by quoting SPG
 congress adhyaksh ne kaha ki pulavama main hamalaa hua to maine press conference kii or kaha ki ye raajnneetik maamla nahin he
 Let me remind you of the Mumbai attack
 taj hotel main aatankwaadi logon ko goli maar rahe the or baahar modi press conference kar rahe the
 He was using people's blood politically
 hamane pulavama hamale main sarkaar kaa saath diya
 This is the difference
 congress adhyaksh ne kaha ki modi china se seb mangavate hai, lekin himachal ke yuvaaon ko pakora talane ko bolte he, kya himachal ke seb maid in india nahin he kya? ham virbhadra singh se gale milte he kyonki unamem tajurba he isliye unase seekhney ko miltaa he, lekin modi adwani va anya anbhavi netaaon se nahin sikhte hai
 So far those who were just spewing poison from the tongue and the hands which were moving towards the button of the bomb, the tongue suddenly sweetened and the hands are moving to embrace instead of the button of the bomb
 duniya hairaan he
 Shocked at what happened in just two months that a dictator suddenly became a messenger of peace
 bam chhod kar baat karne laga
 Forget the enmity and go to the enemy's house
 dushmano ko apane ghar bula rahaa he
 Alania is trying to stop making more bombs
 ji haa, ham baat kar rahe hai uttar korea ke badale-badale netaa marshall kim jong un kii
 But the question is, why Kim's revenge? So the answer is hidden in the event which is going to be held in the first week of June and which is awaited by the whole world
 varsh 2017north korea ke shaasha kim jong un ne kaha tha- mere teble pe batan he, kabhi bhi dabaa duungaa
 So in response to this, US President - Donald Trump had said - i have a bigger button than you and it works too
 varsh 2018ab kim jong un kaa kahana he- agar america yuddh ko khatm karne kaa vaada kare to hamen apane parmaanu hathiyaar rakhkar mushkil main jeene kii kya jarurat he? udhar, america raashtrapati donald trump kah rahe hai- wo (kim jong un) kaaphi khule hue hai or ham jo dekh rahe hai, usase lagata he ki ve ek behad sammanit insaan hai
 Kim and Trumpchand have become soft like Shabnam with blazing shoals in months, Kim and Trump
 2017 main ek duusare ko dhamka rahe the
 And now the verses are being read in praise of each other
 vajah kuch bhi ho magar ye duniyaavaalon ke liye raahat kii khabar he
 These favors of love are being made so that when the American President and the North Korean Marshal meet, they forget the old bitterness
 baat khushnuma maahaul main ho
 Meeting with the condition The dictator of North Korea, who was facing the threat of Third World War on the world, is now ready to give up nuclear weapons
 magar uski bhi ek shart he or wo shart ye he ki america raashtrapati use vachan den ki wo korian yuddh ko khatm kar denge
 However, it will now be decided by the Mahamilan which is to be held in the first week of June
 kim ke badale rukh se duniya hairapub tak korea main kaid rahane vaala kim jong un
 Suddenly, like a presumed politician, he is not only visiting China and South Korea, but is also willing to meet his biggest enemy Donald Trump for peace in the Korean Peninsula
 pichley chand maheenon main kim ne jo karname kiye hai wo uske kirdaar se bilkul ulat hai
 Although these changes are good, the world is still surprised
 duusare deshon ke netaaon se mulakatkyonki pehle kareeb 12 ghante kaa safar kar ke apni hari train se kim china jaataa he or raashtrapati jingping se mulaakaat karata he
 Then, forgetting the 70-year-old rivalry, he sets foot on South Korean soil and is now preparing to meet US President Donald Trump
 wo bhi newclear site ko band karne kii shart par
 There will be a meeting in Punmunjom, let me tell you that there was a debate for a long time about which corner of the world the two leaders would meet
 kyonki apni suraksha kii vajah se plane ke safar se parhez karne vaale kim jong un ke paas vikalpon kii kameen thi
 
 lekin trump ne uski mushkil aasaan kar di or mulaakaat ke liye usee jagah ko tay kar diya jahaan kim or dakshin korian raashtrapati moon mili the
 That is Punmunjom
 agar baithak hui vifal to
 
 
 The whole world is eyeing every movement before this meeting
 kyonki trump or kim kii mulaakaat agar khushnuma maahaul main hui to thik varanaa phir se vishwayuddh kaa khatra mandaraane lagegaa

 In fact, on the day when the results of the Lok Sabha elections were coming in Bihar and after the defeat in the election, Nitish called Lalu or both leaders had comforted each other, then on the same day, Lalu's party spokesman Manoj Jha said this Had said in front of them for the first time that the two leaders would have to come together in Bihar to fight the BJP
 lalu yadav us samay kuch nahin bole the, lekin vidhansabha main nitish kumaar ke istife ke baad jeethanram maanjhi sarkaar ko unki party ne samarthan diya
 But just a few days later, when some leaders of the Janata Dal United made a statement that no one had sought support from the RJD, and it was given to himself, Lalu Yadav was angered

 By the time of this election, the BJP, especially Sushil Modi, was convinced that if two rebel candidates were put up, then two of the four candidates - Pawan Verma and KC Tyagi - contested from the JDU
 - Can be defeated
 lekin nitish ke paas bhi apane chaaron pratyaashiyon kii jeet tay karne ke liye lalu se sidhe samvaad ke alaava koi vikalp nahin bachaa tha, or vahi hua bhi

 After that by-elections were held in 10 assembly seats in Bihar, and for the first time in Hajipur, Nitish and Lalu appeared together on the same platform
 chunaav parinaam bhi anukool rahaa, kyonki chah siten gathbandhan ko milin or mana gaya ki kam se kam do siten congress party ke jid ke kaaran bijepi ke khate main gayi
 But in the meantime Manjhi started showing his attitude and Prashant Kishore had come in contact with Nitish by then
 tab prashanth kishor or samaajawaadee party ke adhyaksh mulaayam singh yadav ne nitish ko jald se jald ek baar phir mukhyamantri kii kursi sanbhaalane kii salaah di
 But as the election drew closer, Raghuvansh Prasad Singh's statements on behalf of Lalu Yadav, especially his party, led to confusion as to whether the alliance would finally be possible
 lekin congress party ne khuleam yah kahkar lalu yadav kii mushkilen badha deen ki chunaav main nitish kumaar kaa hi cheharaa hoga

 And then Prashant Kishor once took the command and ran the entire campaign from settling the seat sharing, perhaps the BJP could not find his cut
 tippaniyan But if Nitish Kumar does not seem very enthusiastic about the grand alliance of Mulayam Singh Yadav today, the reason for this is the internal factionalism of the Samajwadi Party apart from Mulayam cheating him on one occasion before the assembly elections

 But just like Bihar, if mulayam-akhilesh wants to beat the BJP in Uttar Pradesh, he will have to end a mutual dispute first, or at least close his apnea, apna raga
 uske baad sabhi sahyogiyon ko saath rakhane or saath-saath prachaar karne kii ranneeti banani hogi, kyonki upar-upar talmail karne se chunaav main jeet hasil nahin ho sakati
 But there is no opposition in Uttar Pradesh about the leadership of Akhilesh Yadav and his colleagues or even within his party, but Akhilesh has not opened his cards about the alliance, and unless he speaks or takes initiative, maybe the answer
 It would be meaningless to expect any grand alliance under the leadership of Samajwadi Party in the state, even if only players like Prashant Kishore are involved for them
