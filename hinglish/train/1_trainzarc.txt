 But will only salubrious speeches fulfill the goal of making India clean in five years? The answer is found in a nine-month report of the Estimates Committee of Parliament on Financial Affairs, which is headed by Murli Manohar Joshi, a member of the bjp's governing board
 samiti kii tippanee kaabil-e-gaur he, ''prastaavit madon se swatchta mishan ke liye fund uplabdh kaise hoga, sarkaar abhi tak tay nahin kar pai he, jabaki mishan ko puraa karne ke liye 2019 kaa lakshya nirdhaarit kar diya he
 Setting the mission deadline without properly arranging resources will not only affect the target but will also create an atmosphere of serious uncertainty
 isliye sarkaar ko pehle mishan ke liye jaruri dhan kii vyavastha par dhyaan dena chahie
 "where will the money come from? No one will doubt that the appeal of cleanliness and cleanliness of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has had a wide impact
" lekin yah bhi kadavi sachaai he ki bharat kii jo 75 karod aabaadi gaanvon main rahati he, aazaadee ke 68 saal baad bhi usamen 50 karod ke paas apana shauchalay nahin he
 In such a situation, to fulfill the cleanliness mission within the stipulated time, resources are also needed along with the spirit
 sarkari akalan ko hi maan liya jaae to desh bhar main sirf shauchalay banane ke liye kam se kam sava do lakh karod ru
 needed
 lekin centre sarkaar shaharon ke liye 14,623 karod ru
 So Rs 5,000 crore from the state
 kaa anshdaan milegaa, jabaki gramin bharat ke liye 12veen yojana (2012-17) main se shesh 34, 885 karod ru
 Huh
 yani baaki dhan kii vyavastha karne main sarkaar kii badhavaasee saaf dikh rahi he
 However, Union Minister for Urban Development and Parliamentary Affairs, Venkaiah Naidu, who is overseeing this mission, says, "the rest of the money will be arranged through PPP, external cooperation, corporate and Swachh Bharat Fund
" saath hi saarvajanik upakramon or anya sansthaaon se bhi madad lee ja rahi he
 But the Parliament's Estimates Committee on Financial Affairs has expressed deep concern over this
 samiti kii report main saaf zikr he ki sarkaar ne svachh bharat mishan kaa lakshya to nirdhaarit kar liya, lekin uske liye dhan kahaan se aayega isaki koi spasht vyavastha nahin he
 The Parliamentary Standing Committee on the Ministry of Rural Development has raised serious concerns over the absence of any clear guidelines, despite the intention of imposing a two per cent cess for the Swachh Bharat Fund
 to kya saat dashak lagenge?mishan kii safalataa ko lekar jataai ja rahi ashankaayen niraadhaar nahin hai
 The Modi government started the campaign with enthusiasm, but in the general budget, the budget of the Sanitation Department went to the scissors and in the budget, the previous government's Rs 4,260 crore
 ke mukaable 3,500 karod ru
 Allocated sthaayee samiti kii report ke mutabik, isamen se svachh bharat mishan (gramin) ke liye sirf 2,625 karod ru
 12,000 crores annually to meet the target
 aavantit kiya janaa chahie
 So is bureaucracy dominating Prime Minister Modi's 'cleanliness intent', which is not allowing the budget to increase? Bindeshwar Pathak, founder of Sulabh International, states that in the previous government, the Union Rural Development Minister Jairam Ramesh had given Rs 3,000 per toilet amount to be given
 se sidhe 9,000 ru
 Had done it
 agar ve sachiv se poochhate to shaayad yah sambhav nahin hota
 On the basis of personal experiences, Pathak says, "while making the budget, the officers only work by cutting from here and adding there
" lekin hamen yah dhyaan main rakhana hoga ki desh ko netaa chalaaegaa, naukarshah nahin
 Only then can the goal be achieved
 ''swatchta ko lekar modi kii pahal nai nahin he
 When the 1981 census revealed the fact that sanitation coverage is only one per cent, the Central Rural Sanitation Program (CRSP) was started in 1986, which also talked about 'dignity of Women', which Modi mentioned last year from Red Fort
 did
 phir 1999 main purna swatchta kaarykram (tiessi) main badal gaya
 The UPA government transformed it into the Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan in 2012 and the Modi government into the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) in 2014
 naam to badalte rahe lekin isaki pragati behad dhimi rahi
 32 by 2011
 7 fisadi logon tak swatchta kaarykram pahunch sakaa
 Therefore, questions are arising that will it take seven decades to bring the whole of India to the realm of cleanliness? Many officials are skeptical about working for seven decades in five years in Dabi Juban, although SBM (rural) National Deputy Advisor G
 bala subrahmanyam kehete hai, ''log bhale kah rahe hon ki 2019 tak lakshya puraa karnaa sambhav nahin he
 But i believe it is hundred percent possible
 ''lekin shauchalay nirmaan kii disha main ek brands ban chuke sulabh international kaa kahana he ki sarkaar main yojana thik se nahin ban rahi or vishay par pakad nahin rakhane vaale salaahkaar bhartee kiye ja rahe hai jisase mishan main vaisaa utsaah nahin dikh rahaa jaisaa modi ne dikhaaya tha
 If the state government and local bodies do not show speed in the mission of the Mission Modi, the target set on the Daromdar states, but how will it be accomplished
 naidu kehete hai, ''is mishan kii safalataa zyaadaatar rajya or sthaneey nikaayon par nirbhar he
 If they are not interested, it will not be easy to make it successful
 '' (dekhen box) lekin sawaal uthta he ki diarect cash transfar kii baat karne vaali sarkaar apni mahatvakankshi yojana ke liye rajyon par itnaa nirbhar kyon he? agar maujuuda sarkaar swatchta mishan kaa lakshya puraa nahin kar paati he to isaki jimmedaari kis par hogi?sutron ke mutabik pradhanmantri modi laal kile se apane duusare bhaashan main is baat kaa danka peetane vaale hai ki hindustan ke har skool main shauchalay banane kaa lakshya ek saal main hasil kar liya he
 However, there is also manipulation of data here
 sansadeey report main mantralay kii ore se die gaye aankadon ke mutabik, 94 fisadi skulon main ladakon ke or 84 fisadi main ladakiyon ke liye shauchalay he
 There were some crises in it
 lekin pichley ek saal main sarkaar ne is disha main teji se kadam badhaayaa or ab sau fisadi ke lakshya hasil karne kaa daawa kiya ja rahaa he
 But what steps are being taken towards construction of the rest of the toilets? Pathak says, "I wrote a letter to the Prime Minister suggesting some ways to make this mission a success
" jisamen 60,000 yuvaaon or 3 lakh raaj mistriyon kii prashikshit fouj taiyaar kar prati shauchalay 20,000 ru
 Was urged to determine
 isse yuvaaon ko rojgaar bhi miltaa or sthaneey yuvak kamishan ke aadhaar par kaam karte
 Also, if people were directly given money in a bank account, in five years about 15 crore toilets would have been built
 '' haalanki pathak modi ke prayaason kii khulkar tarif bhi karte hai
 He says, "the country has woken up by the call of the Prime Minister
" lekin unke vijan ke mutabik neeche koi soch nahin dikh rahi
 However, Pathak also says with impunity that creating a messenger will not work, if the goal is to be achieved then the government will have to form a dedicated team
 kya he sarkaar kii ranneetiswatchta mishan ko safal banane ke liye sarkaar ne tristareey ranneeti banaai he
 This will first create public awareness and then build infrastructure
 isamen shauchalay, parking aadi kaa nirmaan karnaa he
 Naidu believes that if there is no infrastructure, people cannot be pressured
 lekin dhanchaagat nirmaan ke baad sarkaar singapore jaise deshon kii tarj par kanoon bhi banaaegi jisamen sadakon par parking, thukne yaa anya gandagi failaane par kadaa jurmaana lagaaya jayega
 The government has divided the mission into five parts - construction of toilets, clean drinking water supply, solid waste management, waste-to-electricity and fertilizer production
 haalanki abhi sarkaar kaa zyaadaatar focus shauchalay nirmaan par he
 But for this he gets Rs 12,000 in villages
 to shaharon main 4,000 ru
 While giving, Naidu himself believes that toilets cannot be built in such a small amount
 aise main sawaal uthta he ki khule main shouch se mukt bharat banane kaa sapana is soch ke saath to puraa nahin ho saktaa
 On the other hand the government is about 4 lakh crores
 kii raashi ke saath smart city jaisi pariyojna aage badha rahi he to swatchta ke bina shahar ko smart kaise banaaya ja saktaa he
 The reader believes that if the same amount is given for toilets, it is possible to construct more toilets than the target, not just in the city

 we apologize
 baton se laga ki mulaayam ko shaq he ki ramgopal yadav ne akhilesh ko bhadakaayaa he
 Akhilesh suspects that Amar Singh has provoked Mulayam Singh Yadav
 shivpal ko shaq he ki ramgopal yadav ne netaji ko bahut bada netaa banane nahin diya
 Many doubt that the SP is suspicious
 mulaayam singh yadav ne kaha ki shivpal yadav bahut bade netaa hai
 Shivpal Yadav swore on the Ganges water while saying about Akhilesh Yadav
 aap jaanate hai ki main kasmon main kasam vidya kasam ko mahatv detaa hum magar koi gangaajal kii kasam kha letaa he to bhavuk ho jaataa hum
 However, Shivpal Yadav said that i take the Ganges water and swear to my only son that Akhilesh told me that he will form a separate party
 netaji aapane mujhe adhyaksh pad se hataa kar akhilesh ko adhyaksh banaaya to main unhen lene airport gaya lekin jab akhilesh ko hataa kar mujhe banaaya to usne mere vibhaag chin liye
 What is my fault maine mukhyamantri kaa koun sa aadesh nahin mana
 You need to lead UP now
 maine bihar main mahagathbandhan karaayaa
 Netaji would have become a much bigger leader than that
 ramgopal ne tudwa diya
 Shivpal Yadav said in the open that the Chief Minister wanted to form a separate party
 shivpal yadav ne bihar main mahagathbandhan todane kaa plan banane vaale kaa naam bataa diya
 When told so much, he would also tell that for whom and at whose behest Ram Gopal Yadav was making a plan against Netaji
 taaki baad main hamen yah na jaanane ko na mili ki shivpal bhi usee kaa plan lagu kar rahe the jiskaa plan ramgopal pichley saal lagu kar chuke hai
 Anything i do is possible
 lekin kisi bahari ko doshi bataa kar sapa kab tak batch sakati he
 If you ask a lawyer, in which cases is the punishment for seven years, because Mulayam Singh Yadav told Akhilesh Yadav that what do you know about Amar Singh
 usne mujhe jail jane se bachaaya
 There would have been a minimum sentence of seven years
 amar singh hamaara bhai he
 With one uncle removed, Mulayam Singh Yadav brought a new uncle so that Akhilesh did not lack an uncle
 amar singh bhi bahari se chachaa ho gaye
 He was promoted in this entire game
 vaise amar singh ne mulaayam ko jail jane se kab bachaaya, farvari 2010 se pehle jab ve sapa se nikaal diye gaye yaa may 2016 ke baad jab ve chah saal baad sapa main aae
 Had he been saved before being evicted in 2010, Amar Singh would have told all these while attacking Mulayam
 farvari 2010 main jab amar singh or jaya pradaa ko mulaayam singh yadav ne party kii praathmik sadsyta se nikaala tha kya tab amar singh mulaayam singh ko nahin bachaa rahe the yaa bachaa chuke the
 Both were accused of being involved in anti-party activities
 amar singh ne mulaayam singh ko kaha tha ki yaa to aap lohiavaadi nahin hai yaa phir apane mulaayamawad kaa safed jhooth lohia ji par madhnaa chaahate hai
 It seems that all the quality of leadership is in the same family
 meri galati thi ki maine chaudaa saal se ho rahi is dhaandhlee ko nahin dekha
 This statement is present on the website of the magazine newspaper
 tippaniyan There is also laughter and not laughter at the Samajwadi Party incident
 amar singh ne mulaayam singh yadav ko saat saal jail kii sazaa se bachaane ke liye kis-kis kii madad lee
 Has he taken the help of the same, Professor Ram Gopal Yadav is being accused of taking help
 aaj kaa jhagada shant nahin hua he
 It has been done in public so that all the factions of SP will be ready to fight in the coming days as it did in Lucknow today
 1987 main mulaayam singh yadav ne bhi choudhary charan singh ke lokdal kaa ek hissaa lekar nikal gaye
 They kept calling themselves Charan Singh's adopted son
 tab mulaayam singh yadav 48 saal ke the
 Akhilesh Yadav is 43 years old
 jo jokhim pita ne liya, kya akhilesh le sakate hai
 Is UP ready to take on another new party? kya akhilesh ek or chachaa sweekaar karne ke liye taiyaar hai
 What if Mulayam Singh Yadav gives Akhilesh his chair and becomes the national president
 agar aapaki party he to ye meraa bhi kariyar he
 i am also ruined, i cannot do any other work
 jis oonchai par aapane pahunchaaya mujhe, aap kahenge to us oonchai se hat jaaoongaa
 Saying this, Akhilesh gave up his weapon
 ab ve sapa main rahenge or ladate bhidate rahenge
 The way Mulayam Singh Yadav has praised Amar Singh, what would have happened to Akhilesh
 vahi jaanate honge lekin duusare dalon se amar singh ko kitne phone aa rahe honge ki aapane to pita ke saamne unke bete kii ye haalat kar di ki kehane lage ki main kahaan jaaoongaa
 i will be ruined amar singh kii is jeet par aazam khan kya kehane vaale hai, aap rampur se samachar agency eenai kii bite kaa intazaar kiijie
 What happened in Lucknow was happening in a closed room
 balki band kamare vaali baaten bhi baahar aa gayi jaise kisne chaanta maaraa, kisne dhakka mukki kii, kisne kaha ki tumhaari aisi taisi kar denge

 Akhilesh Yadav is 43 years old

 Is UP ready to take on another new party? kya akhilesh ek or chachaa sweekaar karne ke liye taiyaar hai
 What if Mulayam Singh Yadav gives Akhilesh his chair and becomes the national president
 ye kahkar kya akhilesh ne apane hathiyaar daal diye
 Now they will stay in SP and keep fighting
 mulaayam singh yadav ne jis tarah se amar singh kii taareef kii he usase akhilesh par kya beeti hogi
 They would know but how many calls Amar Singh would be receiving from other parties that you have made the condition of his son in front of the father saying that i will go where
 barbaad ho jaaoongaa
 What Azam Khan is going to say on this victory of Amar Singh, you wait for news agency ani's byte from Rampur
 lakhanu main vahi hua jo band kamare main ho rahaa tha
 Rather, things with closed rooms also came out, like who slapped, who pushed, who said that you will do such a thing
 jeb kaatane kii kisi ne koi shikaayat nahin kii he
 All these leaders are fighting for the poor people of UP
 unase aapaki takalif dekhi nahin gai isliye aapas main ladane lage
 During the speech of the three, several scenes were created which were finalists in the same take
 tasviir to nahin he magar main vivaran dena chahta hum
 In one scene, Akhilesh Yadav touched the feet of uncle and father
 duusare seen main bhattije ne kaha ki amar singh ne chhapava diya ki main aurangzeb hum or netaa ji shahjahan
 In the third scene, the uncle snatches the mic from the nephew and says that the Chief Minister is lying
 chauthe seen main emelsi aashu malik ne mukhyamantri ke kandhe par haath rakh diya
 Like Chal Yaar Hazratganj comes after drinking coffee
 paanchaven seen main mukhyamantri ne apane emelsi ko dhakiya diya or phir surakshakarmiyon ne siem ko hathiyaa liya
 In the sixth scene, Mulayam Singh Yadav asked the youth leader Abhishek Yadav the definition of Samajwadi Party
 saatven seen main abhishek ne kaha ki samanta or sampannataa, jawaab paakar netaa ji sann, kaha ki maine hi bataaya hoga
 In any other scene, if someone has beaten someone, he is not available with us
 ham maafee chaahate hai
 Talking that Mulayam suspected that Ram Gopal Yadav had provoked Akhilesh
 akhilesh ko shaq he ki amar singh ne mulaayam singh yadav ko bhadakaayaa he
 Shivpal suspects that Ram Gopal Yadav did not allow Netaji to become a very big leader
 bahuton ko shaq hai ki sapa main shaq hi shaq he
 Mulayam Singh Yadav said that Shivpal Yadav is a very big leader
 shivpal yadav ne akhilesh yadav ke bare main kehete hue ganga jal kii kasam kha lee
 You know that i give importance to swearing in swearing oaths, but if someone swears on the Ganges water, i get emotional
 baharhaal shivpal yadav ne kaha ki main ganga jal leki or apane iklaute bete kii kasam khaataa hum ki akhilesh ne mujhase kaha ki wo alag party banaaenge
 Netaji, when i removed Akhilesh from the post of President, i went to the airport to pick him up but when Akhilesh was removed and made me, he took away my department
 meraa kya kasoor he
 i did not accept which order of the Chief Minister
 upi kaa netritv ab aapako sanbhaalane kii zarurat he
 i got a grand alliance in Bihar
 netaji usase bahut bade netaa banate
 Ramgopal broke it
 shivpal yadav ne khule main kaha ki mukhyamantri alag dal bananaa chaahate the
 Shivpal Yadav named the name of the planner to break the grand alliance in Bihar
 jab itnaa bataa diya to yah bhi bataa dete ki ramgopal yadav kiske liye or kiske ishaare par netaa ji ke khilaaf plan bana rahe the
 So that later we do not get to know that Shivpal was also implementing the same plan whose plan Ram Gopal had implemented last year
 mane kuch bhi posible he
 But how long can the SP survive by blaming an outsider
 kisi vakil se puuchhiye to saat saal kii sazaa kin kin maamalon main hoti he, kyonki mulaayam singh yadav ne akhilesh yadav se kaha ki tum amar singh ke bare main jaanate kya ho
 He saved me from going to jail
 kam se kam saat saal kii sazaa hoti
 Amar Singh is our brother
 ek chachaa ko nikaalkar mulaayam singh yadav ek nae chachaa le aae taaki akhilesh ko chachaa kii kami na ho
 Amar Singh also became an uncle from outside
 is puure khel main pramotion to unheen kaa hua
 However, when did Amar Singh save Mulayam from jail, before February 2010 when he was expelled from SP or after May 2016 when he came to SP after six years
 agar 2010 main nikaale jane se pehle bachaaya hota to amar singh mulaayam par hamalaa bolte vakt ye sab zarur bataate
 In February 2010, when Amar Singh and Jaya Prada were removed from Mulayam Singh Yadav's primary membership of the party, was Amar Singh not saving or saving Mulayam Singh? donon par party virdohi gatividhiyon main shaamil hone kaa aarope tha
 Amar Singh told Mulayam Singh that either you are not a Lohiaist or you want to put the white lie of your softism on Lohia
 aisa lagata he ki netritv kii sari gunvattta ek hi parivaar main he
 My mistake was that i did not see this rigging for fourteen years
 ye bayaan patrika akhbaar kii website par maujuud he
 The comments samaajawaadee party kii ghatana par hansi bhi aati he or hansi nahin bhi aati he
 Amar Singh took the help of whom to save Mulayam Singh Yadav from seven years in jail
 kya usee kii madad lee jisaki madad lene kaa aarope professor ramgopal yadav par lag rahaa he
 Today's quarrel has not calmed down
 public main hua he taaki sapa ke tamaam gut aane vaale dinon main marpet ke liye taiyaar rahen jaisaa aaj lakhanu main hua
 In 1987, Mulayam Singh Yadav also left with a part of Chaudhary Charan Singh's Lok Dal
 khud ko charan singh kaa dattak putr bataate rahe
 Mulayam Singh Yadav was 48 then
 akhilesh yadav kii umr 43 saal kii he
 The risk that father took, can Akhilesh take it
 kya upi ek or nai party kaa bhaar uthaane ke liye taiyaar he
 Is Akhilesh ready to accept another uncle
 kya hoga agar mulaayam singh yadav akhilesh ko apni kursi dekar rashtriya adhyaksh bana den
 What happened in Lucknow was happening in a closed room
 balki band kamare vaali baaten bhi baahar aa gayi jaise kisne chaanta maaraa, kisne dhakka mukki kii, kisne kaha ki tumhaari aisi taisi kar denge
 No one has complained about pocket cutting
 ye tamaam netaa upi kii garib janata ke liye aapasi sangharsh kar rahe hai
 They did not see your trouble, so started fighting amongst themselves
 teenon ke bhaashan ke dauraan kai seen creat hue jo ek hi tech main final the
 There is no picture but i want to give details
 ek seen main akhilesh yadav ne chachaa or pita ke paanv chhue
 In the second scene, the nephew said that Amar Singh printed that i am Aurangzeb and Netaji Shah Jahan
 tisare seen main chachaa ne bhattije se mike chin lee or kaha ki mukhyamantri jhooth bol rahe hai
 In the fourth scene, MLC Ashu Malik laid a hand on the Chief Minister's shoulder
 jaise chal yaar hazaratganj coffee pikar aate hai
 In the fifth scene, the Chief Minister pushed his MLC and then the security personnel seized the CM
 chathe seen main mulaayam singh yadav ne yuva netaa abhishek yadav se samaajawaadee party kii paribhaasha puch di
 In the seventh scene, Abhishek said that equality and prosperity, after getting the answer, the leader said, that i would have told
 or bhi kisi seen main marpet hui ho, kisi ne kisi ko chaante maare hon to wo hamaare paas uplabdh nahin he
 we apologize
 baton se laga ki mulaayam ko shaq he ki ramgopal yadav ne akhilesh ko bhadakaayaa he
 Akhilesh suspects that Amar Singh has provoked Mulayam Singh Yadav
 shivpal ko shaq he ki ramgopal yadav ne netaji ko bahut bada netaa banane nahin diya
 Many doubt that the SP is suspicious
 mulaayam singh yadav ne kaha ki shivpal yadav bahut bade netaa hai
 Shivpal Yadav swore on the Ganges water while saying about Akhilesh Yadav
 aap jaanate hai ki main kasmon main kasam vidya kasam ko mahatv detaa hum magar koi gangaajal kii kasam kha letaa he to bhavuk ho jaataa hum
 However, Shivpal Yadav said that i take the Ganges water and swear to my only son that Akhilesh told me that he will form a separate party
 netaji aapane mujhe adhyaksh pad se hataa kar akhilesh ko adhyaksh banaaya to main unhen lene airport gaya lekin jab akhilesh ko hataa kar mujhe banaaya to usne mere vibhaag chin liye
 What is my fault maine mukhyamantri kaa koun sa aadesh nahin mana
 You need to lead UP now
 maine bihar main mahagathbandhan karaayaa
 Netaji would have become a much bigger leader than that
 ramgopal ne tudwa diya
 Shivpal Yadav said in the open that the Chief Minister wanted to form a separate party
 shivpal yadav ne bihar main mahagathbandhan todane kaa plan banane vaale kaa naam bataa diya
 When told so much, he would also tell that for whom and at whose behest Ram Gopal Yadav was making a plan against Netaji
 taaki baad main hamen yah na jaanane ko na mili ki shivpal bhi usee kaa plan lagu kar rahe the jiskaa plan ramgopal pichley saal lagu kar chuke hai
 Anything i do is possible
 lekin kisi bahari ko doshi bataa kar sapa kab tak batch sakati he
 If you ask a lawyer, in which cases is the punishment for seven years, because Mulayam Singh Yadav told Akhilesh Yadav that what do you know about Amar Singh
 usne mujhe jail jane se bachaaya
 There would have been a minimum sentence of seven years
 amar singh hamaara bhai he
 With one uncle removed, Mulayam Singh Yadav brought a new uncle so that Akhilesh did not lack an uncle
 amar singh bhi bahari se chachaa ho gaye
 He was promoted in this entire game
 vaise amar singh ne mulaayam ko jail jane se kab bachaaya, farvari 2010 se pehle jab ve sapa se nikaal diye gaye yaa may 2016 ke baad jab ve chah saal baad sapa main aae
 Had he been saved before being evicted in 2010, Amar Singh would have told all these while attacking Mulayam
 farvari 2010 main jab amar singh or jaya pradaa ko mulaayam singh yadav ne party kii praathmik sadsyta se nikaala tha kya tab amar singh mulaayam singh ko nahin bachaa rahe the yaa bachaa chuke the
 Both were accused of being involved in anti-party activities
 amar singh ne mulaayam singh ko kaha tha ki yaa to aap lohiavaadi nahin hai yaa phir apane mulaayamawad kaa safed jhooth lohia ji par madhnaa chaahate hai
 It seems that all the quality of leadership is in the same family
 meri galati thi ki maine chaudaa saal se ho rahi is dhaandhlee ko nahin dekha
 This statement is present on the website of the magazine newspaper
 tippaniyan There is also laughter and not laughter at the Samajwadi Party incident
 amar singh ne mulaayam singh yadav ko saat saal jail kii sazaa se bachaane ke liye kis-kis kii madad lee
 Has he taken the help of the same, Professor Ram Gopal Yadav is being accused of taking help
 aaj kaa jhagada shant nahin hua he
 It has been done in public so that all the factions of SP will be ready to fight in the coming days as it did in Lucknow today
 1987 main mulaayam singh yadav ne bhi choudhary charan singh ke lokdal kaa ek hissaa lekar nikal gaye
 They kept calling themselves Charan Singh's adopted son
 tab mulaayam singh yadav 48 saal ke the
 Akhilesh Yadav is 43 years old
 jo jokhim pita ne liya, kya akhilesh le sakate hai
 Is UP ready to take on another new party? kya akhilesh ek or chachaa sweekaar karne ke liye taiyaar hai

 hindustani duniya bhar main sone ke sabase bade kharidaar hai
 India imported around 850 tonnes of gold in 2014-15
 adhikariyon kaa yah bhi anumaan he ki desh main kareeb175 ton soneki taskari kii gai
 In March 2015 alone, 121 tonnes of gold were imported, compared to 48 in March 2014
 5 ton zyada he
 Despite such a huge amount, according to the World Gold Council, only 557 in India's government treasury
 7 ton sona he
 India ranks 11th in terms of government reserves of gold, while the US has 8,133
 5 ton sone kaa bhandar he or vah duniya main pehle number par he
 Then where does the hundreds of tons of gold imported go? About 22,000 tonnes of gold are held by individuals, families, temples and trusts
 sone kaa yah bhandar shaayad duniya main sabase bada he
 a large portion of this huge storehouse of the Amir temple is deposited with the trusts of the temples in the form of jewelery, coins and gold biscuits of the gods, which is estimated to be more than 3,000 tons
 haalanki kisi bhi mandir kaa prabandhan sone ke is bhandar ke bare main sahi-sahi aankada bataane ke liye taiyaar nahin he
 Economists consider this gold reserves to be inactive, which has no contribution to our economy
 modi sarkaar sone ke is bhandar ko sakriy puunji main badalanaa chaahati he or in bhandaron ko nivesh kaa vikalp banaakar inhen mudra main badalane kii yojana bana rahi he
 These investment options are: to earn interest by depositing gold in banks and gold bonds, which can be sold later
 sarkaar ke kabje main aane ke baad niskriy padi yah puunji sone ke aayaat kharch ko kam kar sakati he or is tarah vittiya ghate ko bhi kam karne main madadgaar ho sakati he
 Not everyone agreed, however, no one is ready to agree to this plan
 mandiron ke treston kaa kahana he ki unki tijoriyon main padaa sona bhakton kasadiyon se chadhaaya jaataa rahaa chadhaavahe
 Take, for example, the safes of the Sripadmanabhaswamy Temple in Thiruvananthapuram
 mana jaataa he ki yahaan sone kaa athaah bhandar he, jiskaa mulya hinduon ke sabase amir maane jane vaale andhra pradesh main thirumala sthit shri venkatesh mandir se bhi zyada he
 The Sri Krishna temple at Guruvayur and the Lord Ayyappa temple at Sabarimala (both in Kerala) are believed to have a treasure of gold worth thousands of crores of rupees
 lekin travnakor, cochin or malabar devswam board is yojana ke khilaaf hai
 These boards oversee 3,890 temples in Kerala
 unhen dar he ki bank unhen sone kii silliyon yaa pattiyon main badal denge, jisase unka mulya khatm ho jayega
 In fact, a source in the Travancore Devaswom Board says that the jewelery he donated during the indo-china War was returned to him by turning it into gold ingots
 kushal kaarigaron ke abhaav ke kaaran unhen dobaaraa aabhushanon main tabdeel nahin kiya ja sakaa
 Trusts of some temples oppose earning interest on gold offered to God
 kerala ke mukhyamantri oman chandi, jo khud isai hai ve bhi sone kaa mudrakaran karne ke khilaaf hai
 They have said, 'we will not allow the central government to hand over the precious jewelery of Sri Padmanabhaswamy temple or any other place of worship without the consent of devotees and temples
 'is maamle main thirumala tirupati devsthanam (titidi) ekmaatr apwaad he, jo andhra pradesh main shri venkateshwar mandir kaa prabandh dekhtaa he
 Apart from central banks, it is considered the owner of the largest gold reserves in the world
 haal ke varshon main titidi ne sone ke aabhushanon ko 22 carat ke sikkon main badalane ke liye mumbai kii taksaal bhejnaa shuru kiya he
 These coins are sold to alms all over the world
 taksaal main galaakar banaae gaye sone ke biscuitbhagvaan ko chadaaye gaye sone ke jevar bainkon ko de die gaye hai
 Melt them in the mint and 0
 995 grad tak shuddh banaakar sone ke biscuiton ke rup main johariyon ko udhaar de diya jaataa he or unase byaaj kamaaya jaataa he
 After the deposit period is over, they are returned as gold and not as cash
 vittiya vishleshkon kaa kahana he ki daan ke rup main praapt saare sone ko galaakar sone kii eenton, chhadon yaa sikkon main tabdeel kar dena chahie or har maheene unki nilaamee kar deni chahie
 The money received from it should be deposited in the bank accounts of the respective religious trusts
 lekin sone kii is nai arthvyavastha kii shuruyaat karne ke liye pehle aasthaa main badlaav laane kii jarurat he

 Rahul's question- Sangh runs BJP through remote control
 bhagwat kaa jawaab-sangh kaa swayamsevak kya kaam karata he, kaise karata he, yah tay karne ke liye vah swatantra he
 The Sangh only worries that the BJP should not make a mistake
 iske liye samanvay baithak hoti he ki swayamsevak vipareet paristhitiyon main alag-alag kshetron main kaam karte hai
 In such a situation, they also have some suggestions
 ve apane suzav dete hai, us par amal hota he yaa nahin hota isse unhen matlab nahin
 Rahul's question - RSS is trying to change the nature of India
 sangh ke alaava doosraa koi sanghathan bharat kii sansthaaon par kabja yaa hamalaa karne kii koi koshish nahin karata
 Bhagwat's answer - Indian society is full of diversities, there is no uniformity in anything, so instead of being afraid of diversities, it should be accepted and celebrated
 agar sangh ke prabhutv ke kaaran koi badlaav hoga to yah sangh kii paraajay hogi
 The collective power of Hindu society should bring changes in the society
 rahul kaa sawaal-desh main sangh apni vichaardhaara ko thopanaa chahta he
 It is a dictatorial organization
 bhagwat kaa jawaab-aresas sabase adhik loktantric sanghathan he
 The Sangh neither imposes its ideology on anyone nor runs its affiliated organizations from a distance

 Ankit and Shalu had gone for a run on Tuesday morning too, but they did not return
 ladki ke ghar na lautne par uske parijan yuvak ke ghar gaye or aarope lagaaya ki unka ladkaa ladki ko bhaga le gaya
 The girl's family also complained about this in Dadri police station
 haalanki ankit ke parijanon ne unhen bharosa diya tha ki kuch bhi galat nahin hoga
 They will explain it to their boy
 ankit ke parijan mangalvaar kii puri raat use dhundte rahe, lekin unhen kamyaabi nahin mili

 gujarat main vidhansabha kii sabhi 182 siton ke rujhaan aa chuke hai
 Initially a fight of thorns was seen
 lekin jaise-jaise matganana aage badhati rahi, congress par bijepi kii badhat banati gai
 However, there was also a chance in the middle when the Congress appeared ahead, but this edge could not be set
 ab tak ke jo rujhaan hai usamen bijepi ko purna bahumat mil rahaa he
 The Congress is far behind the majority but the Congress seems to be benefiting from Rahul's intensive campaigning and Hardik Patel
 mana ja saktaa he ki bijepi kii kamyaabi kii vajah se ek baar phir rajya main mukhyamantri pad kii pehali pasand vijay roopaani hi honge
 BJP has a big win since 2012, this 2017 assembly election became a question of goodwill for BJP in Gujarat
 gujarat pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa griharajya he
 Before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the Congress gave this election the form of Modi vs Rahul Gandhi
 gujarat main navasarjan yatra main 21 din or 15 raaton ke dauraan rahul ke jabardast prachaar abhiyaan ne congress main jaan lautaa di
 But the Congress could not change the outcome as it had expected
 vipareet paristhitiyon main jis tarah ke rujhaan saamne aa rahe hai wo bataate hai ki kam siton ke baavjood bijepi is baar 2012 se zyada badi jeet hasil karne main safal ho rahi he
 Much of its credit also goes to the current CM Vijay Rupani
 patidaaron ke mehsana main hilaa bijepi kaa garh, 7 siton par congress agekaise bijepi ke liye badi jeet he yedrasal, 2012 ke chunaav main BJP ne 119 siten jiti thim
 The Congress then had 57 seats
 lekin tab party ke 'gujarat model' kaa cheharaa narendra modi the
 The Patidars also dominated the BJP
 tab kai chijen bijepi ke paksh main thim
 In fact, this is also the first such election in the last 22 years when a large vote bank of the BJP is said to be angry with him
 isamen aarakshan kii maang karne vaala patidaar samaaj to he hi, wo vyapaaree varg bhi shaamil he jo pichley kuch dashakon se bijepi kaa vot bank bana rahaa
 Regarding demonetisation and GST, it was believed that a large part of the business class might not support BJP this time
 par rujhaan isaki duusari kahani bataa rahe hai
 Going beyond the magic figure of victory in these adverse circumstances explains why this victory is big for BJP
 chunaav main rahul ke 21 din: saurashtra main jhonki takat, pehle charan ke focus main central gujaratisaliye jeet ke sutaradhar hai vijay roopanigujrat main mukhyamantri ke taur par vijay roopaani kaa kaarykaal bahut chota he

While neither heavy vehicles pass over it, nor cars, nor two-wheelers, then what is the reason for the intermittent cracks in this cement concrete part? In the recent rains, there was a lot of water logging on this expressway but it is still inconceivable that the water track has cracked in the cycle track

 bataaya ja rahaa he, donon partiyon ke varisht netaaon ko is gathbandhan ke liye galatchhemiyon ko dur kar matbhed khatm karne honge
 It is said that SP supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav views the Congress with suspicion, he has been against joining hands with the Congress for fear of reviving the oldest party in the state

 It has also written a doctor on its profile on Facebook and Twitter
 maa kaa ilaaj karaane ames aayaa tha tabhi doctoron se milakar doctor banane kii chahat jaagi
 As he passed tenth, Avinash Anand found an easy path and named himself Dr
 Balwinder
 ames ke doctor bhi hairaan hai ki unke bich nakli doctor gum rahaa he
 The water did not land when the real doctors answered the question
 yahi acchhee baat rahi ki inhone turant maan liya ki farzi doctor hai
 The Bar Council claims that 45 percent of the country has fake lawyers
 chif justise jees kehar bhi sunakar hairaan rah gaye
 How would fake lawyers come to court
 kahin ve asli vakeelon ke sahare to apana dhandha nahin chalaate
 Will the courts not see the license number of the lawyer while filing the advocacy
 pataa chalaa he ki hoicourt tak main nakli vakil practice karte hue paae gaye hai
 Fake also has two types of fake lawyers
 ek kii degree farzi he, to doosraa bina degree liye hi vakaalat kar rahaa he
 Bar Council of India Chief Manan Mishra says that 55-60 percent of the attorneys were found to be genuine during verification
 2012 main jab baar council of india ke chunaav hue to 14 lakh vakil matadaata the, lekin jaanch ke baad saadhe chah lakh hi asli paae gaye
 Nearly eight lakh lawyers were found to be fake
 wo is vakt kya kar rahe honge
 Must have been doing real work or started doing fake work elsewhere
 sunakar dar lag rahaa he
 You will remember the incident of former Delhi government minister Jitendra Singh Tomar
 unki vakaalat kii degree farzi pai gai
 a lawyer filed a case against him
 jaanch hui to pataa chalaa ki asli vakil nahin he, jabaki tomars sahab dilli ke kanoon mantri bhi ban gaye the
 It is a privilege not to become a judge
 tomars sahab kitni aahen bharte honge ki degree farzi na hoti to aaj dilli ke kanoon mantri hote
 The danger with fake degrees is that when caught, the reality comes out
 baar council of dilli ne jab isaki jaanch shuru kii to vahi hua jiskaa andeshaa tha
 But when the investigation started, there was a protest among lawyers in the Delhi Bar Council itself
 kai vakil jaanch kaa virodh karne lage
 As a result Tomar saheb had to resign, go to jail
 ab ve kanoon mantri nahin hai
 The speed shown in the investigation of Tomar case is not as fast as in other cases
 tippaniyan Controversy is still going on regarding the degree of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his cabinet colleague Smriti Irani
 haal hi main soochna ayog ke jis ayukta ne dilli vishvavidhyalay ko pradhanmantri kii degree dikhaane ke liye kaha to us afasar se adhikaar hi le liya gaya
 On the other hand, Delhi University challenged his decision in the High Court
 philhal dilli vishvavidhyalay kii taraf se atorni general tushaar mehta ne daleel di he ki vishvavidhyalay tisare paksh kii degree kaa byoraa kisi bahari vyakti ko nahin de saktaa he kyonki tisare paksh ko lekar vishvavidhyalay kii zimmedaari banati he
 The High Court has stayed the order of the Central Information Commission till the April 24 hearing, which considered the Prime Minister's degree public
 smriti irani ne bhi dilli vishvavidhyalay se kaha tha ki hamaari degree na dikhaayen
 Overall, whether it is real or fake, whether it is there or not, the dispute is going on
 ek degree ko satyapit karne main kitna vakt lag saktaa he
 That too the degree of Prime Minister and Cabinet Minister
 chand ghanton main vishvavidhyalay is vivaad ko samaapt kar saktaa he
 Where do fake lawyers become
 vishvavidhyalayon main yaa adaalaton ke campus main
 Are state units of the Bar Council of India examining the degree in this way
 kya jo vakil pakade ja rahe hai unhen bhi tomars kii tarah jail janaa pad rahaa he, kya unke khilaaf bhi koi karrwai hoti he
 What is the responsibility of the Bar Council of India? vaise july, 2016 main bisiai ke teen sadasyon ko jail kii sazaa hui jin par aarope tha ki ye rishwat lekar lau college ko manyata dilaane kaa vaada kar rahe the
 These members were not petty officials but one of them was an Associate Managing Trustee and once a former chairman of the Council
 baar council kaa daawa he ki desh main 45 pratishat farzi vakil hai
 Chief Justice JS Kehar was also surprised to hear
 farzi vakil adaalat main kaise aa jate honge
 Nowhere do they run their business with the help of real lawyers
 kya adaalatein vakalatnama daayar karte vakt vakil kaa license number nahin dekhati hongi

 Mr
 Tomar, how many sighs would have been made that if the degree had not been forged, today Delhi would have been law minister

 Many lawyers began opposing the investigation

 Many lawyers began opposing the investigation

 Good education and better treatment - These are two things which have gone out of reach of the poor and middle class of this country
 insaan kii buniyadi jaruratein kaarobaar main tabdeel ho chuki hai or is bazaar main puch usee kii he, jiske paas paise hai
 The most dangerous thing is that this unusual thing has been accepted as normal
 aise main jab koi patrika in vishyon ko gambhirtha se uthaati he, to ummid jagati he
 The april-june issue (issue 82), which gives such a hope of 'narration', focuses on the condition and direction of education in India

 Famous educationist Rohit Dhankar, in conversation with Noun Upadhyay, has put forward the situation with great impunity
 shiksha vyavastha ko sucharu rup se sanchalit karne kaa sarkari prashasnic dhaancha jis tarah charmaraya hua he, usase koi sakaaratmak ummid bandhati dikhti bhi nahin
 Taking advantage of this, education businessmen have entered the market with full frills
 unke liye shiksha keval munaafe kii chiz he or isliye unka puraa focus munaafe par hi tikaa rahata he
 In such a way, Manoj Kumar has given an accurate analysis of how education is being de-institutionalized in his article 'de-institutionalization of Indian education in post-colonial society'
 satish deshpandey kaa maananaa he ki shiksha ko is niraashajanak paridrishy se yuva peedi hi nikaal sakati he or iske liye bhi unhen lambey chalane vaale andolan kii jarurat mahasoos ho rahi he
 But is this movement so easy? For those in power, education is not only a source of earning but also an arena of politics
 sarala sundaram ne eklavya kii kahani ke punarpth ke jariye is raajnneeti par thodaa prakaash daalaa he
 Laxman Yadav has also effectively outlined the political game in education in his article 'new center of socio-cultural resistance'
 apana khajaana bharne ke liye shiksha vyavastha ko khokhale kar rahe dimakon kaa jab tak safaya nahin hoga, koi bhi andolan majbooti ke saath khadaa nahin ho paaegaa

 After comparing Modi with Atal, Sangma said that his qualities remind him of Vajpayee
 modi ne gujarat main apni kaabiliyat sabit kii he
 But when it comes to the leadership of the country
 agar 2014 main bijepi ke netritv vaali bijepi satta main aati he, to modi ke liye yah badi chunauti hogi

 After spreading unrest in Kashmir, Pakistan's Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) is now engaged in colluding with Naxalites
 is baat ko lekar ke suraksha agenciyon or khufia agenciyon main maathapai chal rahi he ki aakhir bihar ke rajoli main naksaliyon ke paas pakistan se bani eke-47 kii goli kaise pahunch gai
 According to the central security agencies, in the operation in Rajauli a few days ago, the security forces got such a bullet, which the security agencies have been alert
 sutron ne 'ajtak' ko jaankaree di he ki yah goli pakistan ke kisi factory main bani hui he
 Security agencies are now conducting a forensic investigation, so that it will be known from which factory in Pakistan this bullet has been made
 iske alaava agency yah jaankaree bhi hasil karne kii koshish kar rahi he ki naksaliyon ke paas kaise yah goli pahunchi
 According to security agency sources, collusion with ISI and terrorist organizations is nothing new
 isse pehle chhattisgarh main naksaliyon kii baithak main aatanki handlers ke shaamil hone kii khufia jaankaree aa chuki he
 a senior official associated with the security department told Aaj Tak that forensic examination of the bullet kiosks would be done soon to ensure that the ordinance factory in Pakistan had the bullet
 jab forensik report ek baar aa jaaegi to uske baad is goli ke naksaliyon tak pahunchane ke puure root or uske pahunchane vaale kaa pataa lag sakegaa
 While the security agencies are trying to find out whether this bullet and the characters who shot it are playing a role in this whole case, on the other hand, sources have also informed that even before this, the Naxalites in 2005 Bullets were used
 sutron ke mutabik chhattisgarh main ek thane par hamale ke dauraan 2005 main naksaliyon ne is tareeke kii goliyon kaa istemaal kiya tha
 Later in forensic investigation it was found that the bullets made by the factory factory made by the Naxalites in Pakistan were used several times by the Pakistan intelligence agency ISI against the security forces in Jammu and Kashmir
 udhar, aapako bataa den ki aaj bhi naksaliyon ke khilaaf cobra commando ne jharkhand main bada oparation kiya he
 Naxalites were reported hidden in Khunti in Jharkhand

 Oil companies have canceled the dealership of five petrol pumps in the first major action after a case of oil theft was detected through a remote by placing a chip in a dispenser unit in several districts including the capital Lucknow in Uttar Pradesh
 bharat petroleum karporation limited ne chaar panpon or indian oil korporation ne ek pump kii dilarship nirast kar di he
 Both companies have taken possession of these petrol pumps
 inamen do rajdhani lakhanu ke to barabanki, baharich or kannauj kaa ek-ek pump shaamil hai
 At the same time, the dealership agreement for six pumps of Rajdhani has been canceled
 ek adhikari ne bataaya ki ghatatauli kaa racket chalaane vaale graahakon ko thagne ke liye teen tareekon kaa istemaal kar rahe the
 Due to the matter of some pumps being in court, companies have not captured them
 bipisiel company ke chif manager sundar rajan ne bataaya ki estf ne lakhanu ke saat panpon par ek saath chhapemari kar dispencer mashin main remote divaais lagaakar gadabadi karne ke khel ko pakadaa tha
 After taking action, the dealership of accused pumps has been canceled
 kaise hota tel chori kaa dhandha1- dispencer mashin ke pulsar main electranik chip laga di jaati he
 2- The software of dispenser machine is changed
 3- dispencer mashin se jude keepad main chhedchhad kar number badal diya jaataa he
 Follow these methods to avoid this kind of trick, oil thieves make a dent in people's hard-earned money
 petrol meter par dikhaae ja rahe number se kam petrol miltaa he
 For example, if a customer has filled 3 liters of diesel or petrol, then 2
 7 yaa usase bhi kam tel miltaa he
 Sometimes less than half the oil is added
 tel chori kaa ye racket upi main hi nahin puure desh main jor-shor se chal rahaa he
 1- Keep checking
 Pump owners often manipulate the meter in advance to steal mileage petrol
 jaankaar naresh taneja ke mutabik desh main kai petrol pump ab bhi puraani takanic par chal rahe hai jisamen herapheri karnaa behad aasaan he
 According to the rules, only the oil company mechanic can fix the petrol pouring machine
 lekin petrol panpon ke maalik aksar privet maikenikon kii madad lete hai
 Machine tampering occurs at the same time
 lihaaja aap alag-alag petrol panpon se tel dalawaaen or apni gaadi kii milage lagaataar check karte rahen
 2- Keep a sharp eye on the meter: You have often seen that at petrol pumps you are offered to polish the car
 yaa phir koi karmchaaree aapkaa dhyaan bantane ke liye poochta ki aap paisa card se chukaayenge yaa cash se
 Even if you miss meditation for a few seconds, you may feel lime
 lihaaja tel petrol bharwate vakt meter par baraabar najar banaae rakhen
 3- Don't forget to reset the meter
 In many petrol pumps, the employees fill the oil for less than your stated amount
 tokane par graahakon se kaha jaataa he ki meter ko jiro par riset kiya ja rahaa he
 But if you are not careful then often this meter is not brought on zero
 isliye ye jaruri he ki aap tel bharwate vakt sunishchit karen ki petrol pump mashin kaa meter jiro par set he
 4- Ensure that there is no remaining petrol in the pipe, you must have seen that at many petrol pumps, the oil filling pipe is kept long
 karmchaaree petrol daalane ke baad auto cat hote hi fouran nojal gaadi se nikaal lete hai
 Because of this, the remaining petrol in the pipe goes into the tank every time
 lihaaja aap is baat par jor den ki auto cat hone ke kuch second baad tak petrol kii nojal aapaki gaadi kii tank main rahe taaki pipe main bachaa petrol bhi usamen aa jaae
 5- Check if there is force in the pipe, while placing oil, put the car slightly away from the machine so that the pipe remains taut and there is no oil left in the force
 6- round figure kii rakam dekar naa bharwaayen telzyaadaatar log 500, 1000 yaa 2000 jaisi rakam adaa karke petrol yaa dijal bharwate hai
 But many petrol pump owners already fix the machine for such a number
 isliye behatar hoga ki aap round figure kii rakam dekar petrol naa bharwaayen
 For example, by filling petrol of Rs 530 or Rs 1575, petrol theft will be difficult and will not cut your pocket
 iske liye jahaan tak mumkin ho card se pement karen
 7- No longer pressing the nozzle button? Ask the petrol pump person to remove the hand from the nozzle after the oil starts coming out
 tel dalavaate vakt nojal kaa batan dabaa rahane se uske nikalne kii speed kam ho jaati he or chori aasaan ho jaati he
 8- Are you not filling the air? Do you often talk of filling petrol in the petrol pump round figure after the auto is cut off while filling the tank
 iske liye raji naa hon kyonki auto cat hone ke baad aksar aapaki gaadi kii tank main kam tel jaataa he or kai baar mashin riset nahin hone kii vajah se koi tel hi nahin jaataa yani sirf hawa aapaki gaadi kii tank main jaati he

 One of my bookone of my Books tivi ke charchit sho 'kamedi nits vid kapil' ke host kapil sharma kii yah tasviir internet par khub viral ho rahi he
 Kapil Sharma is seen in this picture as a sherwani and a turbaned bride in the wedding pavilion
 internet par is tasviir ke share hone se yah charchaa he ki kapil shaadi ke bandhan main bandha gaye hai
 Apart from this, Kapil Sharma has also taken a break from his show due to injury
 lekin kya yah brakechotaki vajah se liya gaya he yaa phir chori chhipe shaadi ke bandhan main bandhane kii taiyaari ke liye liya gaya he
 It has not been cleared
 industry main is tasviir ke share hone ke baad kapil kii shaadi ke kayaas lagaae ja rahe hai
 Apart from this, it is also feared that this picture may have been taken from the set of Kapil Sharma's upcoming film 'kis Kiss Ko Pyar Karoon'
 kapil sharmadiarector abbaas mastaan kii film 'kis kis ko pyaar karun' se bollywood main debyue karne ja rahe hai
 The film will be released on 25 September
 is film main kapil ke saath actress manjari fundnees, amrutha puri,simran cor mundior eli avraam najar aaengi
 Earlier, it was reported that Kapil will debut in Bollywood with the Yash Raj banner film 'bank Chor'
 lekin production ke saath kuch dikkaton ko lekar kapil is film main kaam karne se peeche hat gaye
 What is the secret behind this picture of Kher Kapil, only time will tell whether it is a public stunt for the film or really just a picture taken from the shoot of the film or really a glimpse of Kapil's wedding
 kya bihar ke mukhya mantri nitish kumaar ne apni mukhyamantri kii kursi bachaane ke liye raajnneeti main saare siddhanton se samjhauta kar liya he? yaa nitish kumaar ne pradhanmantri narendra modi, kendriya grahamantri amit shah or bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ke saamne satta main bane rahane ke liye ghutane tech die hai
 Both these questions are raised after the support of Janata Dal United on the Citizenship Amendment Bill
 khud unke party ke ‘niskriy' rashtriya upaadhyaksh prashanth kishor ne ek twit kar nitish kumaar ke upar ye sawaal uthaaya he
 Nitish Kumar is silent himself
 loksabhaa main unki party ke netaa rajeev ranjan urf lalan singh ne bill kaa is aadhaar par samarthan kiya he
 He said, 'we support this bill
 is bill ko alpsankhyak or bahusankhyak ke aadhaar par nahin dekhnaa chahie
 Good thing if persecuted minorities in Pakistan get citizenship here
 Rajiv Ranjan singh,jdu in Lok Sabha: We support this bill
 This bill should not have been seen in light of Indian citizens, both majority and minority
 If persecuted minorities of Pakistan are given Indian citizenship then i think this is the right thing
 # citizenshipamendmentbillpic
 twitter
 com / u4nf6q2mp7 Whether it is Lalan Singh or Prashant Kishore, everyone knows that the decision to support himself is from Nitish Kumar and Nitish Kumar, who was reading the news papers related to this bill every day, was aware of the nuances of every point of it
 
 lekin iske baavjood apane puraane stand ko badal kar bijepi ke sheersh netritv ke saath baatcheet ke baad is bill kaa samarthan diya
 Let me tell you here that Nitish Kumar opposed this bill in the meeting of the National Council of JDU
 filhal wo bijepi ke saath raajnneeti karenge or iske apni hi nitiyon yaa raajnneetik siddhanton se samjhauta bhi karnaa pade to unhen koi parhez nahin hoga
 He has an idea that his own image is built as the 'greedy leader' of a chair
 nitish kumaar ab in sabhi chizon kii parvaah nahin karte
 His assessment is that whatever the media writes about him, the ground reality of Bihar politics is that his alliance with BJP and Ram Vilas Paswan will continue
 or sansad main bijepi ke samarthan main unako itnaa laabh jarur mil saktaa he ki jediu ko bijepi vidhansabha chunaav main kuch zyada siten de
 At the same time, people who have been watching Nitish Kumar's politics for years, say that he does not go on this issue but now, on every issue, the BJP especially keeps pace with Narendra Modi and Amit Shah
 bhale unhone dhara 370 or tripal talaaq ke mudde par saidhantik virodh kiya ho lekin janata kaa rukh bhaanpate hi in donon muddon par bhi centre sarkaar ko samarthan diya
 Earlier, during the Lok Sabha elections, Nitish Kumar did not even release his party's manifesto as he knew that his stand on these issues would be conflicting with the BJP
 isliye media main koi anayas bhi baat na ho nitish kumaar ne ghoshnaa patr jari karne kii aupchaarikta ko hi khatm kar diya
 Nitish Kumar has been avoiding the media during the entire election, people say that these are all such steps that it was clear that Nitish Kumar does not want to give more attention to ideological issues than Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Amit Shah because they have to give their future especially political future It seems safer to keep these two leaders behind
 jis bhrashtachar ke mudde par nitish kumaar ne argedy ke saath apana gathbandhan todaa usee mudde par jo unke apane mitra or sari ghotaalon ko ujagar karne vaale sarayu raay kaa tikat kaata gaya
 On one hand, Nitish Kumar supported Saryu Rai's candidature, but when BJP called other parties for 4 seats, those who are facing charges in corruption cases say that Nitish Kumar did not have to contest his candidates but bjp's Under the pressure of the central leadership, the vote cut off on the symbol of his party made the people stand in the election
 or ye bhi nitish kumaar ne apni kursi prem main hi kiya he isse pehle bhi gujarat ke chunaav main bhi ye baaten jag zaahir huin
 Most of the Janata Dal United candidates have been raised at the behest of the BJP and they are being supported not only by the Janata Dal United leaders but also the BJP leaders
 baharhaal ye naye nitish kumaar he jo bhrashtachar or sampradayikta se kabhi samjhauta karne kaa daawa karte he lekin jinhone apane zid main sharabbandi kar puure rajya main ek samanaantar arthvyavastha khari kar di
 He gave the freedom to loot criminals, his corrupt cops and people and will spend crores of rupees in the human chain in the name of prohibition, but not for checking blood to catch alcohol drinkers like Lab nor Breath Analyzer like Will measure the necessary equipment
 nitish kumaar ab aparaadhiyon ko sazaa nahin dilaate balki aparaadhiyon ke liye rojgaar kaa intazaam karte hai
 At the same time, if you leave some names on the fingerprint in his cabinet, most do not work without money
 jiskaa ek udhaaharan rajdhani patna kaa jal jamaav tha
 It is a state of communalism that people are burnt alive on the basis of their religion, but Nitish exerts his full energy to suppress the accused of the incident
 adhikansh dange ke maamle main aaropee unke sahyogi bijepi ke netaa nikle lekin nitish jab sazaa dilaane kii baari aayi to maun ho gayi
 So now Nitish Kumar runs away from the media question on every issue, which is completely opposite to his own nature
 nitish ke liye gandhi , lohia or jepi keval bolne ke liye hai unke niti siddhanton ko unhone filhal kursi bachaane ke liye tilanjali de di he
 These are the new Nitish Kumar who currently take their decision at the behest of Modi and Shah
 Their own staunch supporters also believe that they are not surrendering the agreement to stay in power and will do whatever they thought was wrong till yesterday And spoke against policy principles
 isliye ab har mudde par narendra modi or amit shah nitish par haaavee rahenge

 jediu ke saath rishton main lagaataar badhate tanaav ke bichbijepi ke adhyaksh rajnath sinhane kaha he ki party kaa kisi bhi sahyogi dal se kisi tarah kaa tanaav nahin he
 Rajnath Singh, who recently took charge of the BJP, has said that if there is a problem within the NDA, we will solve the problem together
 rajnath singh kaa yah bayaan aise vakt par aayaa he, jab aisi charchaa garm he ki jediu jald hi bijepi se aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav ke liye pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar kaa naam ghoshit karne kii maang kar sakati he
 It is understood that JDU will not agree on the name of Narendra Modi
 agar aisa hota he, to endie main foot padane kaa khatra bad jayega
 However, how comfortable will be the relationship between BJP and JDU on the issue of candidature for the post of PM, this time will tell, but it is certain that the BJP will try its best to keep its old ally together
 ye fatwa ek aise vakt aayaa he jab kuch log kashmir main iesas ke jhande laharaate dekhe gaye hai or is baat kaa andeshaa he ki iesas kii najar hindustani muslim naujavaanon par he
 There were also reports of some being admitted to ISIS
 jab kashmir main goliyaan chal rahi thim or puraa kashmir gusse or hinsa kii aag se jal rahaa tha, tabhi vahaan ek maasoom apni jindagi se jujh rahaa tha
 In the same conditions of the Kashmir Valley, on the 1st of July, an innocent was born in Kashmir
 kashmir main doctoron ne ilaaj se kiya manapaida hote hidoctorone dekha ki uske brain main bleeding ho rahi thi, jisase bachche kii bain aankh nahin khul rahi thi
 Doctors refused to take the risk of treating the child amid such a situation in Kashmir
 bachche ko lekar dilli chale parijanaise main niraash parijan bachche ko lekar fouran dilli pahunche
 On the day of Eid, 7-day Masumgudgaon was admitted to GNH Hospital
 bachche kii surgery karne vaale neuro sarjan suresh katyayan ke paas sabase badi chunauti uske brain main pade clotting ko hataanaa tha
 The team of doctors carried out successful surgeries such as operating a small child was the biggest challenge for the doctors
 bachche ke brain main hamerej kii vajah se lagaataar bleeding ho rahi thi, jisaki vajah se clotting ho gai thi, jise doctoron kii team ne 12 july ko surgery ke jariye nikaala or baccha khatre se bahaar hua
 It took 12 days to complete the Aman message to Kashmir
 is maasoom ko gharavaale khushi-khushi uski maa ke paas le gaye
 According to hospital MD Kuldeep Chaudhary, the biggest reason for taking this case before the management was to reach the message of Kashmir Aman
 ghati main hinsa karne waalon ko bachche kaa paigambache ke folsop treetment ke liye doctor lagaataar parijanon ke sampark main hai
 In view of these conditions, his mother Yasmin could not come with the child in Kashmir
 bachche ko pita or mamaa rajdhani main jis ummid ke saath laae the, wo puri hui or maasoom kii surgery kaamyaab rahi
 Perhaps the well-being of this innocent is enough to convince them that such activities in the valley are causing trouble for other innocent people
 kanyabhrun hatya par ankush lagane ke liye madhyapradesh kii mahila evam bal vikaas mantri maaya singh ne suzav diya he ki ling pareekshan karne vaale doctor kaa license nirast karne ke saath-saath kanya bhrun hatya karwaane vaale abhibhavakon ke khilaaf bhi sakht karrwai honi chahie
 According to an official statement, in a discussion in Bhopal on Saturday on the 21st Foundation Day of Madhya Pradesh Human Rights Commission on the topic of 'female feticide is a curse', Maya suggested that the sex-testing doctor's license be revoked and strict action should be taken against the parents needed

 After the film was passed by the censor board, it was banned by some states, which was declared unconstitutional by the bench of Chief Justice of India
 padmavat par lage itihaas se chhedchhad ke aaropon par supreme court main jamkar bahes hui
 On one hand, ASG Tushar Mehta justified the ban of states, on the other hand, well-known lawyer Harish Salve argued in favor of Padmavat
 bahes ke dauraan gandhi kaa zikr bhi aayaa
 Supreme verdict: Padmavat will not be banned in any state, governments should take care of law and order
 When Gandhi and liquor talk appeared on behalf of the states ASG Tushar Mehta said, "the film has been tampered with historical facts
" is par harish salve ne film main dikhaae jane vaale disclemur ko court ke saamne padhakar sunaaya, jisamen kaha gaya he 'yah ek kaalpanik kahani par aadhaarit he', itihaas se iskaa koi lenaa dena nahin
 Salve even said in court, 'one day i would like to plead that artists should also have the right to tamper with history
 ' is par tushaar mehta ne kaha 'aisa nahin ho saktaa
 You cannot show Mahatma Gandhi drinking whiskey
 ' is par salve ne kaha, 'lekin yah itihaas se chhedchhad nahin hogi
 'all the people present in the court laughed at this
 bataa den ki guuruuvaar ko chif justise of india kii bench ne padmavat par chaar rajyon ke bain ko asanvaidhanik qaraar dete hue kaha, kaanoon vyavastha bananaa rajyon kii jimmedaari he
 It is the constitutional obligation of the states

 The bench termed the state notifications as incorrect
 supreme court ne kaha, is notification se artical 21 ke tahat milane vaale adhikaron kaa hanan hota he
 It is also the responsibility of the states that the people going to see the film get a safe environment
 isse pehle atarni general ne rajyon kaa paksh rakhane ke liye somvaar kaa vakt maanga
 But the court has already given its verdict
 4 vajahen, SC ke faisle ke baad BO par 'padmavat' sabit hogi blockbster # padmavat par salve ne pesh kii daleelaisse pehle nirmaataaon kaa paksh rakhte hue salve ne kaha, rajyon kaa pabandi lagaana cinemetography act ke tahat sangheey dhaanche ko tabah karnaa he
 States have no such right
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki lau and order kii aad main raajnneetik napha nuksaan kaa khel ho rahaa he
 Explain that Viacom 18 had filed a petition opposing the ban of four states

 We will screen 'padmavat' instead of paying for the shows to be screened at 30 pm
 film export kii raay main aisa karne se ‘padmavat’ ke mekars ko film ko lekar chal rahi afvaah ko galat sabit karne kaa mauka milegaa
 Also, the positive response of the people after watching the film will be beneficial for the film

 Shahrukh said, 'I am always happy whenever i dance
 farah uski sakshi ho sakati hai

 kyonki ve mahasoos karte hai ki mere juuton ke bheetar paanv kii anguliyaan thirak rahi hai
 He said, 'I remember that during' Raju Ban Gaya Gentleman 'farah told me not to worry and be happy while dancing
 pichley 20 saalon se is salaah ne vaaki meri madad kii he
 Shah Rukh will be the judge along with Farah in the dance reality show 'dil Se Naachen Indiawale' to be aired on TV

 Bollywood's Most Eligible Bachelor Salman Khan has admitted that he is afraid of loneliness but he also enjoys this fear

 tippaniyandho you think @beingsalmankhan has any fear? This is a revelationa video posted by sonamkapoor (@sonamkapoor) on Feb 15, 2016 at 1:06am PST Psychologists have been eyeing the spinning wheel of Mahatma Gandhi, who has become the brand ambassador of non-violence across the world
 satya ke prayog karne vaale mahatma ke charakhe par manovaigyanik prayog shuru ho chuke hai
 However, these experiments are in very early stages
 lekin shuruaati prayog main jo nattejey aae hai ve utsaah badhaane vaale hai
 In fact, under the supervision of Gandhi Smriti and Darshan Samiti, an institution named Brain Behavior Research Foundation of India has conducted an experiment on the spinning wheel
 haalanki abhi yah shodh simit samay main simit sample ke saath kiya gaya he
 But Dr
, who analyzed the report of this research results
 minaa mishra kahati hai, ''niyamit charkha chalaane vaale samooh main cancentreshan (ekaagratha), processing speed (instrection samajhakar us par pratikriya karne kii raftaar) or atension (dhyaan) kaa str badha hua paaya gaya
 All three refer to the score designed to measure intelligence intelligence (IQ)
 shodh vishleshan main paaya gaya ki charkha chalaane se (ikyuu) badhati he
 Dipankar Shri Gyan, director of Gandhi Smriti and Darshan Samiti (GSDS) also confirmed this
 unhone bataaya report unhen mil chuki he
 The results of the report have also come positive
 ab yah report kuch visheshgyon ke paas bheji jaaegi
 There is also a plan to contact the World Health Organization (WHO) regarding the results of this report
 haalanki unhone yah bhi kaha, shodh nateezon par visheshgyon se raay lene ke baad hi charakhe par bade str par kaam karne kii yojana taiyaar kii jaaegi
 Actually, on behalf of Gandhi Smriti and Darshan, working under the Ministry of Culture, Government of India, Alok Mishra, the founder of Brain Behavior Research Foundations, was entrusted to conduct a pilot study for this project
 sutron kii maane to agar visheshgyon se is project ko lekar hari jhandi milti he to bhavishya main gandhi smriti evam darshan samiti charakhe ko lekar bade str par prayog karne ke baad skulon ke paathyakram main shaamil karne kii salaah dene kii taiyaari kar rahaa he
 Anyway, the present government of the country seems very alert on the importance of the Mahatma
 mahatma gandhi or swatchta mishan ko ek duusare kaa paryaay pehle hi yah sarkaar bana chuki he
 Is the Indian government not preparing to transport the charkha from door to door through the schools? By the way, efforts to make Bapu's knowledge practical are praiseworthy

 a new battle may now begin between the Delhi government and LG House

 According to sources, this amount is about Rs 97 crore, out of which some part has been paid to the advertising agencies, while there is a dispute about who will pay it, the government or the Aam Aadmi Party

 At the same time, the Aam Aadmi Party should also be directed to pay the outstanding money of the advertising agencies directly to them

 This means that Rs 42 crore was a big blow to Kejriwal, lg's order - AAP will have to pay 97 crore to the Aam Aadmi Party to its own government, while Rs 55 crore will have to be paid directly to the advertising agencies by the party
 alji house kii is karrwai ko alji or sarkaar ke bich ek nai jang kii shuruyaat ke taur par dekha ja rahaa he, kyonkiemasidi chunaavake thik pehle aae is maamle se alji house ke saath sarkaar kaa takaraav bad saktaa he

 Senior BJP leader LK Advani said in an exclusive conversation from Aaj Tak that Indira Gandhi was afraid of going to power in the year 1975 and therefore Emergency came into force in the country
 advanine 1975 kaa samay yaad karte hue kaha ki radio chalaane par us din indira gandhi kii aawaaj sidhe ai or unhoneapatkaalki ghoshnaa kii
 Taking a dig at the Congress, Advani said, 'whoever imposed Emergency in 1975 has committed a great crime against the democracy of the country
 us gunaah kaa pachhtaawaa aaj tak kisi ko nahin hua he
 No important leader of the Congress party expressed regret, no one regretted it
 'unhone rahul or sonia gandhi ko ishaaron main kaha ki itane saal main inhen bhi aparaadh bodh to kam se kam hona chahie
 Advani also accused Jawaharlal Nehru of weakening the army at that time
 unhone kaha ki china masale ko vah thik tareeke se hal nahin kar sake
 Asked about the media during the Emergency and today's media, he said that in today's media there is a desire to benefit from the ruling party, which is wrong
 ram rath yatra par sawaal poochne par adwani ne kaha ki unhen uskaa koi pachhtaawaa nahin he
 Rather, he is proud of the Ram Rath Yatra
 unhone raajnneetik partiyon main 'van main sho' kii aalochana kii
 He said that humility is very important after coming to power
 bina vinamr hue desh seva nahin kii ja sakati he
 Amid the aggressive attitude of Shiv Sena and MNS against the North Indian people, Maharashtra Chief Minister Ashok Chavan on Monday warned that the government will not sit silent and will not be allowed to take the law into their own hands
 uttar bhartiya logon ke khilaaf shivasena or maharashtra navnirmaan sena kii gatividhiyon ke bare main puche jane par chavaan ne kaha, ‘‘ham chupchaap nahin baithenge
 We will demonstrate this by our action
 ’’ chavaan ne kaha ki agar manase or shivasena kaaryakarta kanoon apane haathon main lete hai to ‘‘ham unke khilaaf sakht kadam uthaaenge
 He alleged that both parties were campaigning against North Indians for political gains
 ‘‘ham aisa nahin hone denge
 Rejecting the Shiv Sena and MNS campaign, Chavan said that according to the constitution "a citizen can live anywhere in India
" ’’ maharashtra karnataka seemaa vivaad par chavaan ne kaha ki unka pradesh ucchtam nyaayalay ke faisle kaa paalan karegaa
 He said that Maharashtra has presented its stand on the issue in the Supreme Court
 karnataka ne bhi is sambandh main apni baaten kah di hai
 He said, "not much can be said at this stage
 ’’ maharashtra ne ucchtam nyaayalay main ek yachika daayar kar daawa kiya he ki karnataka main seemaa se lage kuch hisse uske hai
 However, Karnataka has opposed this
 uskaa kahana he ki seemaa vivaad mahajan ayog kii siforeeshon ke anusaar sulajhaa liya gaya he
 Chavan said that Karnataka should protect the interests of Marathi-speaking people in Belgaum
 maharashtra belgaum par daawa karata rahaa he
 It is very inspiring to see IIT entrance examination of Krishna and his younger brother Basant, belonging to a poor family of Bihar and suffering from polio
 haalanki, unke liye yahaan tak pahunchane kii raah aasaan nahin thi
 For many years, 18-year-old Basant Kumar Pandit carried his physically challenged elder brother on his shoulders, first to the school and then to the coaching institute
 krishna ne haal hi main ghoshit hue jeii ke parinaam main obisi, viklang kota main akhil bhartiya str par 38veen rank praapt kii he jabaki basant ne obisi shrenee main 3675 veen rank hasil kii he
 His father Madan Pandit owns five 'bighas' of land in Paroria village in Samastipur and his mother is a housewife
 19 varshiya krishna jab chah maheene ke the tab unhen polio ne apni chapet main liya tha
 Later, Basant took the responsibility of carrying Krishna on his shoulders to take him to school
 ejeeniyar banane kii ichha se, donon bhai teen varsh pehle kota pahunche or iaiti kii pravesh pariksha ke liye ek koching santhaan main daakhila liya
 Here too, Basant used to take his brother on his shoulders for a coaching class and both studied together
 tippaniyan Krishna said, when i left the village for coaching three years ago, the people of the village were skeptical of my abilities
 unhen andeh tha ki kya ham is tarah se apni padhai jari rakh paaenge
 For Krishna, his brother is much more important than his 'feet'
 vah apane bhai ke bare main baat karne ke dauraan bahut bhavuk ho jate hai
 His father had asked him to come back after failing his IIT entrance exam in the first attempt but his two elder brothers, working in a garage in Mumbai, assured him financial aid
 krishna ne kaha, ejineering kii padhai puri karne ke baad basant civil seva main shamal hona chahta he jabaki main conmuter ejeeniyar bananaa chahta hum
 Krishna has secured 38th rank at the all India level in OBC, handicapped quota in the recently announced JEE result while Basant has secured 3675th rank in the OBC category
 unke pita madan pandit ke paas samastipur ke paroria gaanv main paanch ‘bigha’ jameen he or unki maa gruhinee hai
 19-year-old Krishna was caught by polio when he was six months old
 baad main, basant ne krishna ko apane kandhon par bithakar skool pahunchane kii jimmedaari lee
 Desiring to become an engineer, the two brothers reached Kota three years ago and enrolled in a coaching institute for the IIT entrance exam
 yahaan bhi, basant apane bhai ko apane kandhon par bithakar koching class ke liye le jate the or donon saath milakar padhai karte the
 The comments krishna ne kaha, jab teen varsh pehle maine koching ke liye gaanv choda tha, tab gaanv ke logon ko meri kshamtaaon par andeh tha
 He doubted whether we would be able to continue our studies in this way
 krishna ke liye, unke ‘pairon’ kii tulana main unka bhai bahut adhik mahatv rakhata he
 He gets very emotional while talking about his brother
 pehle prayaas main iaiti kii pravesh pariksha main asafal hone ke baad unke pita ne unhen waapas aane ke liye kaha tha lekin mumbai ke ek garrej main kaam karne vaale unke do bade bhaaiyon ne unhen vittiya sahaayta dene kaa aashwaasan diya tha
 Krishna said, "after completing engineering, Basant wants to join civil service whereas i want to become a computer engineer
" ejeeniyar banane kii ichha se, donon bhai teen varsh pehle kota pahunche or iaiti kii pravesh pariksha ke liye ek koching santhaan main daakhila liya
 Here too, Basant used to take his brother on his shoulders for a coaching class and both studied together

 According to an estimate, about 60 thousand people commit suicide annually in the country
 inamen sabase zyada sankhya apane ghar main pankhe se latakkar khudakushi karne waalon kii hoti he
 But now a mechanical engineer from Mumbai has made such an anti-suicide fan rod that thwarted suicide
 tippaniyan Sharad Ashani is a retired mechanical engineer from Crompton Company
 ve mumbai ke mulund kshetra main rahete hai
 Sharad Ashani says that in 2004, when he read the news of suicide by model Nafisa Joseph hanging from the fan, it was in his mind that he should do something that no one could commit suicide with the fan
 iske baad se unhone apane idia par kaam karnaa shuru kiya
 According to Sharad, they modified the normal rod used to hang the fan from the ceiling
 unhone saamaanya rod ke bajaay ek aisi rod banaai he jo do hisson main he
 a strong spring in the middle is fitted in such a way that the two pieces together become exactly one rod
 ek pankhaa amuman 6 kilo kaa hota he jabaki isamen lagi spring uskaa teen guna yani kareeb 18 kilo bhaar sahan kar sakati he
 This means that this particular rod usually works like a normal rod but as soon as it weighs more than 20 kg, that is, someone tries to commit suicide by hanging from it, then it gets split in the middle
 rod ke bich main lagi spring ke jariye pankhaa apni jagah se kaaphi neeche aa jaataa he or khudakushi karne vaale ke sir main bhi nahin lagata kyonki spring use upar vaale hisse se jode rakhti he
 Similarly, the electric wire has been connected by placing a cap inside it, so that if someone accidentally presses the fan button after breaking the wire, then the current will not be felt
 sharad ke mutabik anti suicide fain rod is baat ko dhyaan main rakhkar banaaya gaya he ki sabhi tarah ke ceiling fain main lag sake
 Sharad has patented this unique invention
 unhone ise gold life naam diya he
 According to Sharad, they are currently making it experimental only, so its price is from 150 to 200 rupees
 bade paimaane par utpaadan hone ke baad keemat ghat sakati he

 Describing Anna Hazare's movement as political about the Lokpal, Congress General Secretary Digvijay Singh said that the government has accepted most of Anna's demands, but despite this, his repeated threat to the movement shows that his movement has not been non-political
 
 apane grihnagar raghugarh aaye digvijay singh ne kaha ki anna kaa andolan gaiyr raajnneetik nahin he kyonki sarkaar ne unki teen maange citigen charter lagu karne, grad teen ke karmchaariyon ko isamen shaamil karne tathaa prayek rajya main lokayukta banaaye jane kii maang maan lee he lekin iske baavjood unka baar baar andolan kii dhamkee dena darshata he ki unka andolan gaiyr raajnneetik nahin rahaa
 He said that Congress is also in favor of a strict Lokpal and both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha have made similar promises
 unhone kaha ki yadi sakht lokapal ke liye sadan ko aage badhaana pade to badhaana chaiye
 In response to a question, Singh said that if Anna celebrates the Thanksgiving Day on the passage of Lokpal, the Congress will also thank him, but it does not seem that this will happen on behalf of Anna because the people Anna is surrounded with are of anti-congress mindset And they also have a political agenda
 paanch rajyon ke chunaav main anna kii team dwaara congress ke virodh main chunaav prachaar kii dhamkee ke bare main puche jane par singh ne kaha ki anna ke virodh ke baavjood maharashtra ke nagar nikaayon ke parinaamon ne bataa diya he ki janata kii maansikta kya he
 He said that the people of Maharashtra recognize Anna very well, but Congress and NCP have taken over in Anna's home district Ahmednagar and Poona which shows the influence of Anna
 kal 21 disambar ko apane putr jayavardhan singh kii gramin kshetron kii chah divasiy pad yatra ko hari jhandi dikhaane yahaan aaye digvijay singh ne unke putr ke bare main puche jane par kaha ki ve bhi chaahate hai ki unka putr jamini sachai dekhne ke liye akele padayatra kare or gramin ilaakon kii sachai ko khud mahasoos kare or dekhe
 Asked about Jayawardhan Singh contesting from Raghogarh, Singh said that it depends on the party from where it makes him a candidate
 madhyapradesh main khaad sankat ke bare main puche jane par singh ne kaha ki unke das saal ke kaarykaal main kabhi bhi khaad kii kami nahin raheen kyonki us samay pehle se hi is disha main kaam kar liya jaataa tha jabaki bhaajapa khaad kaa kaarobaar karne vaale kalabazriyon ke hiton kaa dhyaan rakhti he or purv main khaad ko ekatrit nahin karti he
 While warning of the Congress movement in the state if the manure crisis is not solved, Singh demanded that the state government should make adequate arrangements of electricity and fertilizer during the farming season

 shri rajput karani sena kangana ranut se maafee maangane ke liye kaha lekin kangana ne maafee maangane se saaf inkaar kar diya
 Actually, Karni Sena opposed the film
 unka kahana tha ki film main rani lakshmibai ko special dance number karte hue dikhaaya gaya he, jo ki parampara ke khilaaf he
 In response, the actress said, 'I am also a Rajput

 Apart from Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the creator / republic day special of modern India, no other leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has contributed as much to its establishment as well as its quick rise in Indian politics, as did LK Advani
 atal-adwani kaa daur 1980 main bhaajapa kii sthapana se pehle hi shuru ho gaya tha
 This can be understood by the painful result of the mysterious assassination of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay, the chief thinker and convener of the Bharatiya Jana Sangh (bjp's predecessor party) in February 1968
 jansangh desh ke kai hisson main shramikon kaa atyadhik patibaddh or anushaasit sangh tha or upaadhyaay kii hatya ke baad vah netritvheen ho gaya
 In such a situation, he needed a new leader
 bhartiya raajnneeti ke ubharate sitare vaajapeyi is daaromadar ke liye aage bade
 But he needed a competent ally to help in the party's mission
 thode sharmile par tej-tararr adwani majboot sankalp ke saath iske liye aage aae
 In the late 1980s and early '90s, by leading the mass movement to rebuild the Ram temple in Ayodhya, Advani brought a major change in both the direction and terminology of Indian politics
 ram mandir nirmaan ke makasad se kii gai adwani kii rath yatra ko itane bade paimaane par hinduon kii pratikriya mili ki isane bhaajapa ke virodhiyon ko sakate main daal diya, to khud adwani bhi hairaan rah gaye
 Sadly, Advani did not hold on to this movement and due to which there was widespread communal violence across the country
 ayodhya andolan ke jariye adwani ne apni party ko vismayakari chunavi kamyaabi dilaai or congress-vampanthi maanakon tathaa dharmanirpekshata kii paripati ko chunauti di
 He called it pseudo-secularism and in response raised the bjp's slogan of a different kind of positive secularism - "justice to all, appeasement to none"
 lekin isi maanak par bhaajapa kii kamyaabi par sawaal khadey hote hai
 The BJP has failed to formulate a holistic vision and practical policies to ensure socio-economic justice of the disadvantaged sections of Indian Muslims
 or adwani ko yah aarope saajha karnaa padegaa
 Now things have deteriorated to such an extent that the BJP is limited to its success on the majority
