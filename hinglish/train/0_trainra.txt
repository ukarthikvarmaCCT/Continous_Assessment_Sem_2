 In which many dances including Lavani, Bihu, Garba, Angra, Ghato, Manipuri, Braj Ki Holi, Balbeliya, Cholam will be performed
 iske alaava mahotsav ke dauraan kalchakra maidan main vibhinn vibhaagon dwaara bhavy pradarshnee lagaai jaaegi
 Here, Kailash Kumar, who is engaged in stage decorations, says that the stage is being designed completely in accordance with the Buddhist culture, there will be a cast of Buddhist sect in it, which will increase the attraction of the audience
 mahabodhi mandir trust or paryaton vibhaag dwaara yojit hone vaale is mahotsav ke bare main rajya ke paryaton vibhaag ke mantri sunil kumaar pintu kehete hai ki buddha circuit ke sabase mahatvapurn sthal ke rup main chihnti bodhgaya ko is tarah ke aayojanon se saanskrithik rup se samrudh banane main madad milegi vahiin paryatakon ko bhi aakarshith kiya ja sakegaa
 It is worth mentioning that in the recently completed Kalachakra Puja, two and a half lakh tourists including Buddhist monks had gathered
 ullekhneey he ki varsh 1998 main centre kii rashtriya janatantric gathbandhan kii sarkaar ne buddha mahotsav prarambh kiya tha
 Its purpose was to attract tourists
 lakhanu ke sijeem court main ek visphot hone kii khabar he
 a twine bomb explodes in the bathroom of the court
 dhamaake main koi ghayal nahin hua he
 Honeypreet, who flew in the air with beautiful dreams, is shattering every dream of what once arrived behind bars
 ab uskaa koi sapana salaamat nahin he
 Only his crimes are left, which are being accounted for
 jamaanat milane kaa uskaa sapana bhi kal tut gaya
 Now she will remain in judicial custody till 6 November
 haniprit beshak khud ko bekasoor maane, lekin uske khilaaf police ke paas ek nahin kai pukhta saboot hai
 On the basis of the same evidence, the police have once again shocked Honeypreet's hopes
 somvaar ko jab haniprit ke maamle kii sunwaayee hui, to ummid thi ki use jamaanat mil jaaegi
 He would get freedom from bars, but this could not happen
 somvaar ko video conferencing ke jariye haniprit kii panchakula court main peshi hui
 But the Panchkula court lawyers were on strike
 lihaaja haniprit kii ore se koi vakali pesh nahin hua
 Due to lack of debate, the court posted the next date of hearing in the Honeypreet case on 6 November
 yani ab haniprit ambala central jail main hi rahegi
 Not only this, on November 6, Honeypreet is unlikely to get bail, because during his judicial custody, the police have found many important evidence against Honeypreet
 inamen haniprit kaa mobile or laptop to he hi
 Now the head of Police, Honeypreet's biggest Razdar uniformed detective head constable Lalchand has been engaged
 chandigarh police kii intelligence wing main tainaat head consteble lalchand haniprit kaa wo jasoos tha, jo vardi to pahentaa tha police kii, lekin duty bajaata tha haniprit kii
 On Monday, 25 August, the entire conspiracy to flee Ram Rahim from Rohtak came to light after this spy of SIT was arrested, which was hatched by Honeypreet
 esaiti kii poochtacha main lalchand ne hairaan karne vaale khulaase kiye hai
 He is also said to be a staunch supporter of Baba
 shaayad isi vajah se lalchand ne apane guru ke liye apni vardi or ohade kaa nazaij istemaal kiya
 There was a conspiracy to drive Ram Rahim out of Rohtak's Sunaria jail after he was convicted in the rape case by sadhvis
 is sajeesh kii mastermind haniprit thi
 The entire concept belonged to Honeypreet and her gang
 lekin use amali jama pehanaane main lalchand juta tha
 It was the responsibility of the police to escape from the heavy security cordon
 sajeesh ko anjaam dene ke liye baba ke is chele ne teen plan banaae
 But Lalchand failed in every attempt
 faraari kaa 'plan e'sajeesh thi ki 25 agast ko adaalat ke faisle ke baad court se nikalne hi baba ko deraa ke bullate pruf gaadi main baithaaya jayega or faraar kar diya jayega
 That gang of Dera wanted Baba to be taken to Chandigarh before a bullet proof vehicle
 phir himachal pradesh main use najaron se ojhal kar diya jaae, yaa phir use saat samandar paar bhej diya jaae
 But the policemen in the guard did not allow Ram Rahim to sit in the car of the dera
 is tarah haniprit kaa plan e naakaam ho gaya
 Ferrari's 'plan B' first conspiracy failed, so Lalchand, a devilish mind, got involved in Plan B
 iske tahat usne ram rahim ke sabhi commandos ko police kii gaadi main hi baithne kii salaah di
 The same police car in which Baba was being sent to the helipad
 planning thi ki sabhi commando police kii gaadi main baithenge or ram rahim ko ganpoint par furti se bhaga le jaaenge
 But Plan b also failed, because Baba's commandos did not get approval to sit in the police car
 faraari kaa 'plan si'2 sajishein naakaam rahane par lalchand ne kii aakhri koshish kii
 He himself went up to Western Command in a bullet proof car chasing Baba
 taaki kisi tarah se use bhagaaya ja sake
 Many times Lalchand took his car to the side of the police SUV carrying Baba
 lekin is formule kaa bhi dam nikal gaya
 Honeypreet's crimes are yet to be accounted, but with whom Honeypreet committed all the crimes, Gurmeet Ram Rahim has been behind bars for 20 years
 deraa sachcha sauda kaa pramukh ram rahim ab jail kii tanhai main baitha apane gunahon ko yaad karata rahata he
 Her family arrived in jail yesterday to meet her, but the wife did not come
 baba kii baby doll or khud baba ke paas ab aise rangeen vakt ko yaad karne ke sivaa koi chaara nahin bachaa he
 The truth is that the crimes committed by both of them together, they are now being cut in different jails
 deshadroh kii aaropeehanipricmbala jail main udhaas or gumsum baithi he
 His father Ram Rahim is serving a 20-year sentence in Sunaria Jail

 Kejriwal said that after this, the pace of work in Delhi has increased

 supreme court ne buudhvaar ko apane aitihaasik faisle main uparajyapal or dilli sarkaar ke vivaad ko nipataane kii koshish kii
 The court drew a line between the rights of the two
 haalanki abhi bhi vivaad jari hi he
 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley gave his opinion in the blog on the Supreme Court's decision
 adhikariyon ke transfar mudde par unhone likhaa ki faisla dilli sarkaar ke haq main nahin gaya he
 Arun Jaitley said that it has been clear from the decision of the Supreme Court that the Delhi government does not have the authority of the police, in that case it cannot constitute an investigating agency for the previous crimes
 jetali ne fasebuk postmen kaha ki iske alaava yah dharna ‘puri tarah trutipurna he’ ki sangh shasit cader sevaaon ke prashasan se sambandhit faisla dilli sarkaar ke paksh main gaya he
 Jaitley said that there have been many issues that have not been directly commented on, but there are indications of those cases through implication
 kendriya mantri ne isi sandarbh main yah bhi likhaa he ki jab tak ki mahatv ke vishyon ko uthaaya na gaya ho, un par vichaar vimarsh nahin hua or koi spasht mat prakat na kiya gaya ho tab tak koi yah nahin kah saktaa ki aise muddon par chuppi kaa matlab he ki mat ek yaa duusare ke paksh main he
 Jaitley said that the second thing is that the Supreme Court has made it clear that Delhi cannot compare itself with other states
 aise main yah kahana ki sangh shasit cader sevaaon ke prashasan ko lekar dilli sarkaar ke paksh main faisla diya gaya he, puri tarah galat he
 Significantly, a five-judge bench of the Supreme Court had on Wednesday unanimously ruled that Delhi cannot be granted full statehood, besides stating on the rights of the Lieutenant Governor that he did not have the authority to decide independently
 
 uparajyapal ko chuni hui sarkaar kii madad or salaah se kaam karnaa he
 Jaitley said that this decision explains in detail the constitutional principle behind the constitution and also confirms what is written in the constitution
 unhone kaha ki isse na to rajya sarkaar yaa centre sarkaar ke adhikaron main ijapha hua he or na hi kisi ke adhikaron main katautee hui he
 This decision underscores the importance of the elected government as Delhi is a union territory and hence its powers are under the central government
 pradhanmantri narendra modi aam taur par sarkari baithkon main apane adhikariyon ko shant rahakar dhyanpurvak sunate hai, lekin pichley dinon ek baithak ke dauraan unhen khaas taur par apni baat kehete suna gaya
 In this meeting, the officials of the Ministry of External Affairs were telling them in detail why the policy of making equal distance with America, Japan and China would be better
 karibiyon ke mutabik, modi ne kaha ki aisi niti hamaare liye acchhee or vaanchit to ho sakati he lekin lambey samay tak tikegi nahin
 He said that contradictions will emerge soon and it will be difficult to keep a balance ahead
 yah pichley maheene modi kii japan yatra se pehle kii baat he
 It was from this trip that the process of high-level diplomatic meetings began
 haalanki yah vichaar baatcheet main phir kabhi ubharkar nahin aayaa, lekin modi kii america yatra se saaf ho gaya ki ve chaahate kya hai
 When the talk was made after a commotion, noise and roar, the Modi government indicated that they were ready to cover half of their share to join hands with Washington
 yahi nahin, ve isse bhi zyada aage badaae ke liye taiyaar hai taaki america ke saath aisa rishta kaayam kar saken jaisaa aitihaasik parmaanu sandhi ke baavjood upie sarkaar bhi nahin kar saki thi
 Modi is understood to have made it clear at the beginning of the preparations that India cannot be seen as a "denial" country that opposes every American initiative on global platforms
 yah sandesh washington post akhbaar main america raashtrapati baraak obama ke saath sanyukt sampadakeey likhane jaise saadhaaran-se mudde ke dauraan bhi saaf ho gaya
 Initially, the plan was that according to the common practice, an article written by the Prime Minister should be published in the prestigious American newspaper
 yah lekh likh liya gaya or chhapane ke liye manjuur bhi ho gaya
 Then the American side added some things to this article and put forward the idea of a joint article with Obama
 andar ke log bataate hai ki america main bhartiya mishan or kuch anya adhikari is suzav ke paksh main the, lekin pradhanmantri karyaalay ke kuch adhikariyon sahit south block ke varisht adhikari asahaj mahasoos kar rahe the
 He raised questions about the results of "equal distance" and "perception of being Western"
 maamla aakhirkaar modi kii mej par pahunchaa
 Sources reveal that it took them "less than a minute" to approve the joint article
 bas phir kya tha
 All that was left to do now was to combine the words of both the parties in a joint article in an acceptable manner
 nahin kehane waalon ko nahinkareeb ek saal pehle upie sarkaar ke yojana ayog ke prabhaavshaalee upaadhyaksh montek singh ahaluvalia ko us vakt congress or mantrimandal ke sadasyon kaa baari aakrosh jhelana padaa tha jab unhone montrial protocol ke tahat refrisrents or hydrophlurocarbans (echensi) ko charanbaddh tareeke se hataane par charchaa ke liye ji-20 kii ek aadhikarik soochna kaa anumodan kar diya tha
 He was almost blamed for succumbing to the Western agenda of denying developing countries the technology necessary for development
 unke aalochakon ne tab pradhanmantri manmohan singh tak ko is vivaad main ghaseet liya tha kyonki ahaluvalia ne ji-20 kii baithak main manmohan ke daahine haath ke rup main dohari bhoomika nibhaai thi
 The controversy became a more serious issue when the Ministry of Environment and to a lesser extent the Ministry of External Affairs also jumped into it and argued that this put India's broader stance on climate change at risk
 iskaa nateeja yah hua ki pichley saal jab manmohan ne america kii yatra kii to unhen apni rajnatik jamaa-puunji kaa khaasaa istemaal karte hue kuch mohalat hasil karne ke liye dotarafa baatcheet kaa rasta kholana padaa taaki bharat sareekhe vikasshil deshon par doorgaami asar daalane vaale is samvedansheel mudde ke vibhinn pahaluon kii jaanch-padtaal kii ja sake
 The situation changed with the arrival of Modi
 paryaavaran mantralay ne ab bhi montrial protocol ke khilaaf sakht rukh apanaaya, iske tahat echensi ko charanbaddh tareeke se hataane par charchaa kii to baat hi chhod den
 The Ministry even argued that China also has the same attitude as ours and both countries together can prove to be tremendous on the international stage
 yah alag baat he ki mantralay bhul gaya ki beijing aakhri kshanon main dotarafa saudebaaji ke liye janaa jaataa he
 Sources reveal that the Prime Minister rejected the suggestion in an instant
 unhone kaha ki bharat vaishvik mahatv ke muddon par itnaa sankeern ravaiya akhriyaar nahin kar saktaa
 The result was that India approved the purity of the entities under the Montreal Protocol in the india-us Joint Statement and agreed to take steps to discuss the phased removal of hfcs
 ab pehla kadam yah hoga ki montrial protocol kii agali baithak se pehle fouran dotarafa baatcheet kaa aayojan kiya jayega jisamen ‘‘echensi ko hataane ke liye nai technology kii suraksha, laagat or vyavsaayik pahunch’’ par vichaar kiya jayega
 Modi resolved one of America's biggest concerns in one stroke, a concern on which his predecessor pulled back due to domestic political pressure
 isi tarah, farm sabsidi or vishwa vyapaar sanghathan main krishi par charchaa ke rajnatik rup se zyada samvedansheel mudde par bhi modi samjhauta karne ke liye kahin zyada taiyaar the
 Especially when it is seen in light of the recommendations of the Ministry of Commerce
 sutara bataate hai ki mantralay chahta tha ki aisi doorgaami chhuton or riyaayaton ke liye aawaaj uthaai jaae jo na sirf maujuuda kaaryakramon par balki nikat bhavishya kii nai yojanaon par bhi lagu hon
 He wanted the entire structure of agricultural subsidies to be redesigned
 iske myne hote pehle ke tamaam samjhauton ko dobaaraa kholana or yah aprasar sandhi ko taar-taar kar dene ke baraabar hota
 This would have shattered the conversation before it even started
 zyada ahm yah ki aise prastaav kii peshkash maatr se hi america ko alag tarah kaa sandesh jaataa
 The Prime Minister did not want to make the situation worse
 unhone tay kiya ki yah baarikiyon main jane kaa samay nahin he
 Instead, he gave the issue a positive stance by openly endorsing trade facilitation agreements on the one hand and insisting for a more open two-way dialogue on the World Trade Organization and agriculture on the other
 sankshep main apane maatahaton ko unka sandesh saaf thah aise muddon par bharat alag-thalag dikhaai na de or isliye sanyukt vaktavy main bhi milakar saath kaam karne kii yah manshaa prakat honi chahie
 This also made it clear that they are also committed to resolving the issues of accountability that are hindering peaceful nuclear energy contracts
 saajha yuddhayasis america yatra kii sabase badi uplabdhi he yupoton kii technology
 This major strategic consensus was not publicly announced and it was concealed under the guise of looking forward to the future on defense cooperation
 sutron ne india today ko bataaya ki aircraft lonching system sareekhee atyaadhunik technology hasil karne ke liye america ke saath baatcheet chal rahi he
 The system will be installed on the aircraft carrier that India is developing on its own
 darasal, pot-nirmaan vah kshetra he jisamen aane vaale dinon main america pratiraksha technology sahyog main badhotaree kii ummid kii ja rahi he
 This is part of the overall effort to make India a naval power with unbeatable capabilities
 saath hi yah donon deshon ke liye aapasi saajhedaari or ranneetik praathamikta kaa vishay bhi he
 Modi had no hesitation in pursuing the defense agenda
 yahaan tak ki unhone israeli pradhanmantri benjamin netaanyahu se bhi kaha ki ve bhartiya companiyon se saajhedaari karen or bharat main factoriyaan lagaaein
 But he indicated his positive intent with the US and accepted a very old demand
 yah maang thi dotarafa malabar yuddhayaason ko zyada unnat or bade paimaane par anjaam dena
 America has long wanted more countries to be included in these exercises and to expand their scope by making them truly multilateral
 purvavarti raksha mantri e
 K
 antni haalanki iske sakht khilaaf the
 He had convinced the Cabinet Committee on Security at that time that India should not participate in any military activity that looks like a small alliance against China
 modi ne is faisle par katai dobaaraa nahin sochaa
 The US now expects some major agreements like the LSA (logistics Support Agreement) and the CISMOA (communication and Information Security Memorandum of Agreement) to be finalized after this decision
 ye wo samjhaute hai jinaki badaulat zyada niyamit rup se sanyukt abhyaason kaa sanchaalan kiya ja sakegaa or ek aisa maahaul banaaya ja sakegaa jisamen donon desh milakar saath kaam kar saken
 The UPA government did not want to sign these agreements because it feared that they would push India into America's court
 modi in samjhauton par aane vaale dinon main jo bhi faisla lenge usase tay hoga ki unki sarkaar kaa dirghakaalin ranneetik jhukaav kitni dur tak or kis had tak jaataa he
 Sources reveal that at the moment Modi's initial offer was so strong that he could get a favorable response from Washington
 purv prabhaav se lagu kar-nirdhaaran sareekhe kai muddon par chintaaon ke baavjood america bijness companiyon ne bhi sakaaratmak rukh prakat kiya
 Even in the matter of tax assessment, the Modi government tried to give confidence in every way but avoided giving complete assurance
 yahaan tak ki america sarkaar kaa rukh bhi sahyog dene vaala hi tha or usne smart shaharon se lekar svachh bharat tak modi kii kareeb-kareeb harek pahal sang judye kii tatparta dikhaai
 The strategic implications of the business relationship were also revealed when Blackrock CEO Laurence Fink offered to hold a Global Investors' Conference in India in February next year, and assured investment of at least $ 6 billion
 sutara bataate hai ki us vakt pradhanmantri kii ankhon main chamak aa gai or unhone vaada kiya ki is conference main ve khud shaamil honge
 It is to be noted that Blackrock has held similar conferences for major countries like Canada and Mexico tied up in a strategic partnership with the US and has achieved considerable success

 Ibobi Singh resigned from the post of Chief Minister
 Ibobi Singh was earlier seeking the first opportunity to form the government, referring to the Congress emerging as the single largest party in the assembly elections
 vahiin unhone mangalvaar ko mukhyamantri pad se istipha de diya
 Earlier, Governor Najma Heptulla had said that till Singh's resignation, she cannot start the process of formation of a new government

 On seeing the blazing pictures of the forests of Uttarakhand, many people wrote an article that this crisis is 'man made'
 'main maid' kaa matlab hota he ki prakruti ne nahin, insaan ne ise bulaayaa he
 But this 'man made' has no face
 lekin yahaan 'main maid' ke do chehre hai
 There is also a face to the government and its laws
 'main maid' kehane se pataa nahin chalata ki in kaarnon main sarkaar or uski vyavasthaaon kii kya bhoomika he
 At times it seems that the local people have a role
 kai baar hoti bhi he, jab atikaraman vagairah ke zariye pahaado kii zamin ko kancreet ke jangal main badal diya jaataa he
 There are a third type of people whose face does not reflect the terminology of this 'man made'
 wo hai aam log
 Those who have their own relationship with the forests
 jo jangalon se jite hai or jeene ke liye jangalon ko bachaate hai
 Addresses such as 'man Made Crisis' do not reveal whether these common people got away from the forests themselves or the government-made laws
 jangalon ke bare main jo log adhyayan karte hai yaa jo jangalon se disple pikchar yani deepi se zyada pyaar karte hai wo sachchidanand bharti ko jaanate hi honge
 Sachchidananda Bharti, a Gandhian and associated with the Chipko movement, has been working since 1974 to save forests in Uttarakhand and revive old ways of conserving water
 aap aise logon kii tasviren tivi par kam hi dekhte honge or bharti ji tivi par aana bhi nahin chaahate
 They feel that work is what is done silently
 sachchidanand bharti ko indiragandhi rashtriya paryaavaran puraskaar mil chukaa he
 i called the same Sachchidanandji that what new can i tell my audience on the pretext of this crisis, so that they can understand the crisis and they have a relationship with the forests

 First you see this picture
 aapako paanch gadde dikhaai de rahe hai
 It must have seemed that the rainwater has been filled in them
 aam taur par inhen chaal khaal kehete hai
 If there is water in small pits, it is called water tank
 kaaphi hariyaali ke bich swimming pul kii tarah jo talab dikhataa he, use khaal kehete hai
 The skins are large in size
 chaal nahar kii shakl main dikhte hai
 All these moves are made at an altitude of 2000 meters above sea level
 aam jubaan main aap inhen chote talab kah sakate hai
 Sachchidanand Bharti ji said that earlier in the village, the same way the gait skin was made at the same height
 inamen barsaat kaa pani jamaa hota tha
 After the rain, the water rushes down from there and moisture starts forming in the forests
 jahaan jaisi zamin hoti he waisi chaal khaal banati he
 These are raw pits from which water keeps seeping slowly
 inke risne ke raste main ek do meter tak hari ghaas ug aati he
 The result is that even if there is a fire in the forests, it does not spread due to green grass
 sachchidanand bharti ne apni ek zindagi main aisi 2000 chaal khaalen banavaa di hai
 He says that because of these trick skins, there is no fire in his area because there is moisture there
 pani he
 Sahasra Tal is also a place, that is, the jugal of thousand talas
 gangotri or kedarnath ke bich main he
 It is considered one of the prettiest lakes of Uttarakhand
 bharti ji ne bataaya ki agar ye chaal khaalen bani hoti to aaj helicopter se aag bujhane kii morrkhtaa nahin kerani padati
 That is why we are flying helicopters because we stopped making motion skins
 chennai isiilie to dub gaya kyonki hamane talabon ko bhar kar vahaan apartment bana diye
 Wherever we should be ashamed of our old antics, but our focus is on the pictures of the heroic heroic images
 isse aane vaali awaz hamaare bheetar romaanch paidaa karti he ki ham apane samay main prakruti kii har sharaarat par kaabo paa sakate hai
 The same helicopter was also flying in Chennai
 is helicopter ke udne kaa yahi matlab he ki hamane apni dharti jangal kaa itnaa nuksaan kar diya he ki ram bharose se pehle ab sena kaa hi bharosa he or sena ke jawan puri mustaidi se ye kaam karte bhi hai
 Lives of life
 aap dekhiye ki uttarakhand ke jangalon main lagi aag ko bujhane ke liye helicopter kahaan se pani bhar kar ud rahe hai
 The name of that place is Bhimtal
 yaheen se pani bharte hai or aag bujhaate hai
 If a sufficient number of tricks and skins had been made, it might not have happened
 chaal khaalon kaa zikr aapako hamaari sarkaron kii yojanaon main yaa to nahin milegaa yaa milegaa bhi to naam ke liye
 Now people do not even know about the chawls and not even the forest officials

 Remember how many people drowned because they forgot to swim there
 jabaki kosi ke har kisse main naav or tairne waalon kaa zikr miltaa he

 The government has forgotten and the forest officer too
 1931 main british sarkaar ne kumaun panchayat van niyam banaae
 The people of the mountains were given the responsibility of managing the forests
 kaha jaataa he ki uttarakhand main 12,600 van pachaanyate bani hai or inhen ek kanoon ke tahat adhikaar bhi diya gaya he
 The fact is that there is no trace of these Van Panchayats
 agar ye sakriy hoti to aaj aag bujhane ke liye helicopter se pani kii barsaat nahin kerani padati
 Army does not have to call

 The government has a land
 inhen kwas van forest kehete hai yani jangle ke jangal
 The other land used to be called Civil Soyam Bhoomi

 The government also helps in planting forest or fodder vegetation

 They do not have a budget, but from every family in the village, one person is a member of the Van Panchayat
 van panchayat main pachaas fisadi purush or pachaas fisadi mahilaon kaa hona anivaary he
 If the government had implemented its plans for forests through these forest panchayats, it would have continued to have a relationship between the forest officer, local departments and the common people through the forest panchayat
 van panchayatein disambar-janvari ke maheene se aag bujhane kii taiyaari kar leti thim jo ab nahin hoti he
 Until the people have the right over the forests, why would they consider the forest as their own
 kai baar kanoon se unhen vanchit kiya gaya he or kai baar kanoon ke naam par fansaa diye jane ke kaaran log in jangalon se jaivik sambandh nahin bana pate hai
 The forests are as alien to the people there as for you and us tourists
 aapako sochna to padegaa ki jo samaaj sadiyon se jangal ke saath ji rahaa he wo itnaa anjaan kaise ho gaya
 These distances are not today, we have also made these decades
 ek geet bhi he
 Yun Banja Burasan Rakha Jagwali, Yun's leaves mother milk, roots water
 iskaa matlab yah hua ki banj burans kii rakhwali isliye karo kyonki inaki jadon main pani he or pattiyon main doodh he
 Now we are bringing water from somewhere else
 angrezon ne apane samay main yatayaat ke maarg ke kinare fire line banani shuru kii
 Which are called fire protection bandage in Hindi
 yah ek tarah kaa gaddha hi hota tha jahaan pattiyon ko jamaa kar van vibhaag november-disambar main jala detaa tha
 Dry pine leaves were eliminated
 november-disambar kii nami main aag failati bhi nahin thi
 In summer, a stick spread
 kya pataa van vibhaag ke paas ab paryaapt karmchaaree bhi na ho
 Now all this will not work with the mobile app
 aadmi se hoga or aadmi kaa rishta samaaj or sarkaar se hoga tabhi hoga
 Fire safety straps are not even made in many places
 isse pataa chalata he ki van vibhaag jo abhi kaaphi kaam karata hua dikh rahaa he us vakt kahin or khoyaa hua tha
 People also used to pick leaves
 magar ab kanoon kaa dar sataata he
 Whatever assurance the government gives, they know that there will be such a clause which will be used
 sachchidanand bharti ne ek baat kahi
 Does not set fire
 aag to tili lagaati he
 Pine leaf is called Pirul
 ek jamaane main uttarakhand ke log is pirul se koyala bana lete the
 Now due to fear of law, we are unable to make coal
 pehle koyala banane ke liye chid kii pattiyon ko chun laate the
 The leaves were lit in a large box
 carbon baahar nikal jaataa tha or koyala bachaa rah jaataa tha
 If you do not associate the use of dry leaves with employment, then by applying how many employees, you will choose these leaves
 is buniyadi baat ko samajhenge to samasya kii jad pakad sakate hai
 Now this practice is over
 uttarakhand ke apper mukhya sachiv es ramasvami ne kaha ki 3 may ko aag lagane kii 121 ghatnaayen hui hai
 95 has been controlled
 is vakt sakriy aag kii sankhya 26 bataai ja rahi he
 The number was 40 on Monday
 ravivaar ko 70
 This indicates that large parts of the fire have been controlled
 iske liye rajya ke 11,160 karmchaariyon ko kaam main lagaaya gaya he
 People from national and state disaster management forces are also working
 emai-17 helicopter ne nainital or paudi main 16 udaanen bhari hai
 Four people have died and 16 are said to be injured
 abhi tak vanagni kii 1591 ghatnaayen darj ho chuki hai
 46 cases of willful fire have been registered
 vahi haal himachal pradesh kaa he
 In 8 of the 12 districts there, the forest cover has been spread
 ek maheene se soobe main aag kii ghatnaayen darj ho rahi hai
 The fire was also set last year
 har saal lagati he
 This time it is engaged on a much larger scale, but we are awake like it was the first time
 paryaavaran se lekar jangalon kaa jo nuksaan hua he uski bharpai itani aasaani or jaldi to nahin hone vaali
 By the way, we think that in this fire only forests are burnt, but it is not so, animals and birds also suffer terrible losses in this fire
 khaastaur par pakshiyon ke andey vagairah jal jate hai
 Reptiles, the animals of the reptile species, become the big prey of this, who are not able to get out of the fire in the forest, as well as many big animals do not survive this fire
 insaanon kii banaai sansthaaon ke alaava ek or zimmedaar he chid
 Many people said that the pineapple has spread due to pine
 dawanal jangalon kii aag ko kehete hai
 Did everything happen due to pine? kya ye khalanaayak hi he
 We are living in a time where information is coming and going at rocket speed
 aapane chid ke pedo ko dekha hoga
 Sighs will be filled
 inhen pedo se aag nikal rahi he
 Sushil Bahuguna has disseminated the available information about pine trees
 jo ham aapako yahaan bataanaa chaahate hai
 Pine is a coniferous tree
 isaki pattiyaan nukili hoti hai
 These trees range from eight hundred meters to 1800 meters in the mountains
 ek aam dharna he ki eucalyptus kii tarah chid ko bhi angrez europe se lekar aae, lekin aisa nahin he
 Pine tree has been found in the Himalayan hills for millions of years and has played a major role in creating the Himalayan forests
 tippaniyan Nature has been developed for places where there are steep slopes, rocky terrain, little or no soil layer, very little water, strong and direct sunlight
 aisi pahari dhalaanon ke liye chid ko prakruti ne taiyaar kiya tha, isiilie paristhitiki main santulan banaae rakhane ke liye chid kii bhi zarurat he
 Pine is also used commercially
 is ped kii lakdi makaan banane or duusare kaamon main istemaal hoti he
 Wood of some species of pine is also used in paper making
 isse nikalne vaala racin yani lisa bhi kai kaam aata he
 Its distillation produces turpentine oil
 sawaal ye he ki itane kaam kaa ped chid kyon pahaado ke jangalon main aag kii ek vajah ban rahaa he
 Actually, due to commercial reasons, there was large scale plantation of pine
 pehle plantesan ke saath-saath chid ko timber ke liye kaata bhi jaataa tha, lekin 1981 ke baad 1000 meter ke baad har tarah ke ped ke kaatane par roak lag gai
 Chir took the most advantage of it
 wo banj, burans or deodaar jaise mishrit vanaspati ke jangalon main bhi bas gaya
 Gradually the pine began to replace the trees of the rest of the species
 chid kii ek khaasiyat ye he ki wo apane aasapaas kisi duusari prajati ke ped ko panpane nahin detaa
 When the pine was not harvested in these forests, it started snatching the place of broad leaf forests
 nateeja ye hua ki chid kaa vistaar bahut bad gaya
 Due to this expansion, the fire in the forests also expanded because the pine tree spreads the fire in the forest rapidly
 chid kii pattiyaan jab suukh jaati hai to badi tezi se aag pakadati hai
 In summer, the pine leaves spread like a carpet in the forests, and a slight spark also spreads rapidly in the form of a large fire
 chid se nikalne vaala rezin jise lisa kehete hai wo bhi aag bhadakaane kaa kaam karata he
 These fires spread from pine forests burn other flora
 chid ke jangal pashu-pakshiyon ke bhi zyaada kaam nahin aate
 Pine leaves make pineic acid, which makes the soil acidic
 chid ke ped barish se mitti kaa kataav rokane main zyada sakasham nahin hote
 Water sources in the pine forests dry up, because moisture in the soil is unable to be retained
 lekin chid kaa ye vistaar insaani vajahon se hua, isliye chid ko jangal kaa villen kahana thik nahin hoga
 Where nothing else happens there is a pine and it makes a big forest
 hamane hi use un jagahon par panpane ke liye jagah di jo jagah uski nahin thi

 Sushil Bahuguna has disseminated the available information about pine trees
 jo ham aapako yahaan bataanaa chaahate hai
 Pine is a coniferous tree
 isaki pattiyaan nukili hoti hai
 These trees range from eight hundred meters to 1800 meters in the mountains
 ek aam dharna he ki eucalyptus kii tarah chid ko bhi angrez europe se lekar aae, lekin aisa nahin he
 Pine tree has been found in the Himalayan hills for millions of years and has played a major role in creating the Himalayan forests
 tippaniyan Nature has been developed for places where there are steep slopes, rocky terrain, little or no soil layer, very little water, strong and direct sunlight
 aisi pahari dhalaanon ke liye chid ko prakruti ne taiyaar kiya tha, isiilie paristhitiki main santulan banaae rakhane ke liye chid kii bhi zarurat he
 Pine is also used commercially
 is ped kii lakdi makaan banane or duusare kaamon main istemaal hoti he
 Wood of some species of pine is also used in paper making
 isse nikalne vaala racin yani lisa bhi kai kaam aata he
 Its distillation produces turpentine oil
 sawaal ye he ki itane kaam kaa ped chid kyon pahaado ke jangalon main aag kii ek vajah ban rahaa he
 Actually, due to commercial reasons, there was large scale plantation of pine
 pehle plantesan ke saath-saath chid ko timber ke liye kaata bhi jaataa tha, lekin 1981 ke baad 1000 meter ke baad har tarah ke ped ke kaatane par roak lag gai
 Chir took the most advantage of it
 wo banj, burans or deodaar jaise mishrit vanaspati ke jangalon main bhi bas gaya
 Gradually the pine began to replace the trees of the rest of the species
 chid kii ek khaasiyat ye he ki wo apane aasapaas kisi duusari prajati ke ped ko panpane nahin detaa
 When the pine was not harvested in these forests, it started snatching the place of broad leaf forests
 nateeja ye hua ki chid kaa vistaar bahut bad gaya
 Due to this expansion, the fire in the forests also expanded because the pine tree spreads the fire in the forest rapidly
 chid kii pattiyaan jab suukh jaati hai to badi tezi se aag pakadati hai
 In summer, the pine leaves spread like a carpet in the forests, and a slight spark also spreads rapidly in the form of a large fire
 chid se nikalne vaala rezin jise lisa kehete hai wo bhi aag bhadakaane kaa kaam karata he
 These fires spread from pine forests burn other flora
 chid ke jangal pashu-pakshiyon ke bhi zyaada kaam nahin aate
 Pine leaves make pineic acid, which makes the soil acidic
 chid ke ped barish se mitti kaa kataav rokane main zyada sakasham nahin hote
 Water sources in the pine forests dry up, because moisture in the soil is unable to be retained
 lekin chid kaa ye vistaar insaani vajahon se hua, isliye chid ko jangal kaa villen kahana thik nahin hoga
 Where nothing else happens there is a pine and it makes a big forest
 hamane hi use un jagahon par panpane ke liye jagah di jo jagah uski nahin thi
 Those who study about forests or who love forests more than the display picture i

 DP, must have known Sachchidananda Bharati
 gandhivadi or chipko andolan se jude rahe sachchidanand bharti 1974 se uttarakhand main jangalon ko bachaane or pani ke sangrakshan ke puraane taur-tareekon ko zindaa karne ke kaam main lage hai
 You would rarely see pictures of such people on TV and Bharti ji does not even want to come on TV
 unhen lagata he ki kaam vahi hota he jo chupchaap kiya jaae
 Sachchidanand Bharti has received Indira Gandhi National Environment Award
 maine inhin sachchidanandji ko phone kiya ki is sankat ke bahaane main apane darshakon ko kya nayaa bataa saktaa hum, jisase wo sankat ko samajhen bhi or jangalon se unka ek rishta bane
 Whatever type of political parties they vote for, they can talk on topics other than hindu-muslim topics
 pehle aap is tasviir ko dekhiye
 You see five pits
 aisa lag rahaa hoga ki inamen barsaat kaa pani bhar gaya he
 They are usually called chawl skins
 chote chote gaddhon main pani bharaa ho to use jal tilaiya kehete hai
 The pond, which looks like a swimming bridge amidst a lot of greenery, is called khal
 khaal aakaar main badi hoti he
 Chal is seen in the shape of a canal
 samudr tal se 2000 meter kii oonchai par bani hui hai ye sabhi chaal khaalen
 In the common tongue, you can call them small ponds
 sachchidanand bharti ji ne bataaya ki pehle gaanv-gaanv main isi tarah oonchai par chaal khaal banati thi
 Rain water was stored in them
 barsaat ke baad vahaan se pani neeche kii taraf risataa he or jangalon main nami banane lagati he
 Wherever the land is, it moves like a skin
 ye kachche gadde hote hai jinase pani dhire dhire risataa rahata he
 On their way to grow, green grass grows up to one to two meters
 nateeja yah hota he ki jangalon main aag bhi lagati he to hari ghaas ke kaaran fail nahin paati he
 Sachchidanand Bharti has made 2000 such skins in his life
 unka kahana he ki in chaal khaalon kii vajah se unke ilaake main aag nahin lagi he kyonki vahaan nami he
 There is water
 sahasr taal ek jagah bhi he yani hazaar taalon kii jagal
 It is between Gangotri and Kedarnath
 uttarakhand ke sundartam jhiilon main se ek mana jaataa he
 Bharti ji said that if these tricks were made of skins, it would not be foolish to extinguish fire with helicopters today
 isliye to ham helicopter uda rahe hai kyonki hamane chaal khaalon ko bananaa band kar diya
 That is why Chennai was drowned because we filled the ponds and built apartments there
 kahaan to hamen shame aani chahie apni puraani harkaton par, lekin hamaara dhyaan helicopter kii vir ras vaali tasveeron par hai
 The voice that comes from it creates a thrill in us that we can overcome every mischief of nature in our time
 chennai main bhi yahi helicopter ud rahaa tha
 This means that the helicopters are flying so much that we have done so much damage to the forest of our land that now before the Ram trusts, the army is now confident and the soldiers of the army do these tasks with complete efficiency
 jaan kii baazi laga dete hai
 See where the helicopters are flying with water to extinguish the fire in the forests of Uttarakhand
 us jagah kaa naam he bhimtal
 It is from here that we fill the water and extinguish the fire
 agar paryaapt sankhya main chaal or khaal bani hoti to shaayad ye naubat nahin aati
 You will not find any mention of trick skins in the schemes of our governments or even for the name
 ab logon ko bhi chaal khaal ke bare main pataa nahin he or van adhikariyon ko bhi nahin
 Kosi was flooded in Bihar
 yaad kiijie kitne log dub kar mar gaye isliye ki vahaan ke log tairnaa bhul gaye the
 Whereas in every story of Kosi, there is mention of boat and swimmers
 ek or gandhivadi anupam mishra ne likhaa tha ki dub rahaa he tairne vaala samaaj
 The picture of the trick skin is telling that the forests are burning because Uttarakhand has forgotten its own way to extinguish the fire
 van panchayatein jab sakriy hoti thi tab barish ke dinon main hi chaal khaalen banani shuru ho jaati thim
 To understand the fire spreading in Uttarakhand, you have to understand about the forest panchayats
 gram panchayaton ke bare main to aapane suna hi he
 You must have heard about forest panchayats but have forgotten
 sarkaar bhi bhul gai he or van adhikari bhi
 In 1931, the British Government made the Kumaon Panchayat Forest Rules
 pahaado ke logon ko wanon ke prabandhan kaa jimmaa diya gaya
 It is said that 12,600 forests are made in Uttarakhand and they are also empowered under a law
 asaliyat yah he ki in van panchayaton kaa koi ata pataa nahin he
 Had it been active, it would not have to rain water from helicopters to extinguish the fire today
 sena bulani nahin padati
 There are three types of land in the mountains
 ek zamin hoti he sarkaar kii
 These are called quas forest forests i
e
 jungle forest
 duusari zamin hoti jise civil soyam bhoomi kehete hai
 The village is controlled by this but the government is also involved
 jangal yaa chaare kii vanaspati lagane main sarkaar bhi madad karti he
 The third land is the village's own land
 us zamin par log jangal lagaate hai
 Forest Panchayats are formed on the remaining land leaving class one i
e
 government land
 inkaa koi bajet nahin hota magar gaanv ke har parivaar se ek vyakti van panchayat kaa sadsy hota he
 It is compulsory to have fifty percent males and fifty percent females in Van Panchayat
 agar sarkaar wanon ke liye apni yojanaon ko in van panchayaton ke zariye lagu karaati, sakriy rakhti to van adhikari, sthaneey vibhaagon or van panchayat ke zariye aam logon ke bich ek rishta jari rahata
 Van panchayats used to prepare to extinguish the fire from the month of december-january which is no longer there
 jab tak logon kaa jangalon par adhikaar nahin hoga tab tak ve jangal ko apana kyon samajhenge
 Many times they have been deprived of the law and many times people are not able to make biological connections to these forests due to being implicated in the name of law
 vahaan ke logon ke liye bhi jangal utane hi paraaye hai jitne aap or ham paryatakon ke liye
 You have to think how the society that has been living with the forest for centuries has become so unknown
 ye dooriyaan aaj kii nahin hai, ye bhi dashakon se hamane banaai hai
 There is also a song
 yun banja burasaan rakkha jagavaali, yun kaa pattiyon maa doodh, jadon maa pani
 This means guarding the oak burras because they have water in the roots and milk in the leaves
 ab ham pani kahin or se uda kar laa rahe hai
 In their time, the British started building fire lines along the road of traffic
 jinhen hindi main aag suraksha pattee kehete hai
 It used to be a kind of pit where the forest department used to collect leaves and burn them in november-december
 chid kii sukhi pattiyaan samaapt ho jaati thim
 The fire did not spread in the november-december humidity
 garmi main ek tili se fail gai
 Does the forest department not have sufficient staff now? ab ye sab kaam to mobile ap se nahin hoga
 Will be with man and man will be related to society and government only
 kai jagahon par aag suraksha pattiyaan banati bhi nahin hai
 This shows that the Forest Department, which is still doing a lot of work, was lost somewhere else at that time
 log bhi pattiyon ko chun laate the
 But now the law is afraid of sarkaar jitna bhi aashwaasan de unhen pataa he ki koi dhara aisi hogi jiskaa istemaal kar liya jayega
 Sachchidananda Bharati said one thing
 aag chid nahin lagaataa he
 The fire burns
 chid kii pattee ko pirul kehete hai
 Once upon a time, people of Uttarakhand used to make coal from this Pirul
 ab kanoon ke bhay ke kaaran koyala nahin bana pate
 Previously, they used to select pine leaves for making coal
 ek bade se dibbe main band kar pattiyon ko jalaayaa jaataa tha
 The carbon escaped and coal was left
 sookhe patton ke upyog ko rojgaar se nahin jodenge to kitne lakh karmchaaree lagaakar aap in patton ko chunavaayenge
 If you understand this basic thing, then you can get the root of the problem
 ab ye pratha khatm ho gai
 Uttarakhand Additional Chief Secretary s Ramaswamy said that there were 121 fire incidents on 3 May
 95 ko kaabo kar liya gaya he
 At present, the number of active fires is reported to be 26
 somvaar ko yah sankhya 40 thi
 70 on Sunday
 isse sanket mil rahaa he ki aag ke bade hisse par niyantran paa liya gaya he
 For this, 11,160 employees of the state have been employed
 rashtriya or rajya aapadaa prabandhan bal ke log bhi kaam main jute hai
 The Mi-17 helicopter has taken 16 flights to Nainital and Pauri
 chaar logon kii maut ho chuki he or 16 ghayal bataaye ja rahe hai
 So far, 1591 incidents of Vanagni have been reported
 jaanboojh kar aag lagane ke 46 maamle darj kiye gaye hai
 The same situation is in Himachal Pradesh
 vahaan ke 12 main se 8 zilon main dawanal fail chukaa he
 Fire incidents have been reported in the state since a month
 aag pichley saal bhi lagi thi
 It takes place every year
 is baar zyada bade paimaane par lagi he lekin ham aise jaage hai jaise pehali baar lagi ho
 The damage that has been done to the forests from the environment is not going to be compensated so easily and quickly
 vaise ham sochate hai ki is aag main sirf jangal jalte hai lekin aisa nahin he, pashu-pakshiyon kaa bhi is aag main bhayanak nuksaan hota he jo jangal kii aag main ghir jate hai
 Especially the eggs of birds, etc
 are burnt
 reptiles yani sarisrup prajati ke jaanavar iskaa bada shikaar banate hai jo jangal main aag kii se baahar nahin nikal pate, saath hi kai bade jaanavar bhi is aag se batch nahin pate
 Apart from the institutions made by humans, another responsible is the pine
 kai logon ne kaha ki chid ke kaaran dawanal failaa he
 The forest fire is called forest fire
 kya chid ke kaaran hi sab kuch hua
 Is this the villain? ham ek aise samay main rah rahe hai jahaan suchanaaen rocket kii raftaar se aa rahi hai or chali ja rahi hai
 You must have seen pine trees
 aahen bhari hongi
 Fire is coming out from these trees
 susheel bahuguna ne chid ke pedo ke bare main uplabdh jaankariyon kii cheerfaad kii he
 What we want to tell you here
 chid ek conipheras yani shankudhari ped he
 Its leaves are pointed
 pahaado main ye ped aath sau meter se 1800 meter kii oonchai tak hota he
 There is a general belief that, like Eucalyptus, the British brought the pine from Europe, but it is not so
 chid kaa ped karodon saal se himalay ke pahari ilaakon main paaya jaataa he or himalay ke jangalon ko banane main isaki ek badi bhoomika rahi he
 The comments chid ko kudarat ne darasal aisi jagahon ke liye viksit kiya jahaan tikhi dhalaan hon, chattani ilaaka ho, mitti kii parat bahut kam ho yaa naa ke baraabar ho, pani bahut kam ho, tej or sidhi dhoop aati ho
 Pine was prepared by nature for such mountain slopes, therefore pine is also needed to maintain balance in the ecology
 chid kaa vyavsaayik istemaal bhi khub hota he
 The wood of this tree is used in building houses and other works
 chid kii kuch prajatiyon kii lakdi kaagaz banane ke kaam bhi aati he
 The resin that comes out of it is also useful
 isiike distilation se tarapentine oil banataa he
 The question is why the pine tree is becoming a cause of fire in the jungles of the mountains
 darasal vyavsaayik kaarnon se chid kaa bade paimaane par plantesan hua
 Earlier, along with the plantation, the pine was harvested for timber, but after 1981 the cutting of all kinds of trees was stopped after 1000 meters
 iskaa sabase zyaada faaydaa chid ne uthaaya
 He also settled in forests of mixed vegetation like banj, burras and cedars
 dhire-dhire chid ne baaki prajatiyon ke pedo kii jagah lenaa shuru kar diya
 One peculiarity of pine is that it does not allow any other species of tree to grow around it
 chid ko jab in jangalon main kaata nahin gaya to usne chaudee pattee ke jangalon kii jagah chhinani shuru kar di
 The result was that the expansion of the pine greatly increased
 is vistaar kii vajah se jangalon main aag kaa bhi vistaar hua kyonki chid kaa ped jangal main aag ko tezi se failaata he
 When the pine leaves dry, they catch fire very quickly
 garmiyon main chid kii pattiyaan jangalon main ek carpet kii tarah fail jaati hai or ek halki si chingaari bhi badi aag kii shakl main tezi se failane lagati he
 The resin from the pine which is called LISA also acts as a fire
 chid ke jangalon se faili ye aag duusari vanaspatiyon ko jala detii he
 Pine forests do not work much for animals and birds either
 chid kii pattiyaan pinic acid banaati hai jisase mitti acidic ho jaati he
 Pine trees are not much capable of preventing soil erosion from rain
 chid ke jangalon main jal strot suukh jate hai, kyonki mitti main nami qaayam nahin rah paati
 But this expansion of pine was due to human reasons, so it would not be right to call pine as the villain of the forest
 jahaan kuch or nahin hota vahaan chid hota he or wo bada jangal banaata he
 We gave him a place to grow in places that were not his
 pehle aap is tasviir ko dekhiye
 You see five pits
 aisa lag rahaa hoga ki inamen barsaat kaa pani bhar gaya he
 They are usually called chawl skins

 samudr tal se 2000 meter kii oonchai par bani hui hai ye sabhi chaal khaalen
 In the common tongue, you can call them small ponds
 sachchidanand bharti ji ne bataaya ki pehle gaanv-gaanv main isi tarah oonchai par chaal khaal banati thi
 Rain water was stored in them
 barsaat ke baad vahaan se pani neeche kii taraf risataa he or jangalon main nami banane lagati he
 Wherever the land is, it moves like a skin
 ye kachche gadde hote hai jinase pani dhire dhire risataa rahata he
 On their way to grow, green grass grows up to one to two meters
 nateeja yah hota he ki jangalon main aag bhi lagati he to hari ghaas ke kaaran fail nahin paati he
 Sachchidanand Bharti has made 2000 such skins in his life
 unka kahana he ki in chaal khaalon kii vajah se unke ilaake main aag nahin lagi he kyonki vahaan nami he
 There is water
 sahasr taal ek jagah bhi he yani hazaar taalon kii jagal
 It is between Gangotri and Kedarnath
 uttarakhand ke sundartam jhiilon main se ek mana jaataa he
 Bharti ji said that if these tricks were made of skins, it would not be foolish to extinguish fire with helicopters today
 isliye to ham helicopter uda rahe hai kyonki hamane chaal khaalon ko bananaa band kar diya
 That is why Chennai was drowned because we filled the ponds and built apartments there
 kahaan to hamen shame aani chahie apni puraani harkaton par, lekin hamaara dhyaan helicopter kii vir ras vaali tasveeron par hai
 The voice that comes from it creates a thrill in us that we can overcome every mischief of nature in our time
 chennai main bhi yahi helicopter ud rahaa tha
 This means that the helicopters are flying so much that we have done so much damage to the forest of our land that now before the Ram trusts, the army is now confident and the soldiers of the army do these tasks with complete efficiency
 jaan kii baazi laga dete hai
 See where the helicopters are flying with water to extinguish the fire in the forests of Uttarakhand
 us jagah kaa naam he bhimtal
 It is from here that we fill the water and extinguish the fire
 agar paryaapt sankhya main chaal or khaal bani hoti to shaayad ye naubat nahin aati
 You will not find any mention of trick skins in the schemes of our governments or even for the name
 ab logon ko bhi chaal khaal ke bare main pataa nahin he or van adhikariyon ko bhi nahin
 Kosi was flooded in Bihar
 yaad kiijie kitne log dub kar mar gaye isliye ki vahaan ke log tairnaa bhul gaye the
 Whereas in every story of Kosi, there is mention of boat and swimmers
 ek or gandhivadi anupam mishra ne likhaa tha ki dub rahaa he tairne vaala samaaj
 The picture of the trick skin is telling that the forests are burning because Uttarakhand has forgotten its own way to extinguish the fire
 van panchayatein jab sakriy hoti thi tab barish ke dinon main hi chaal khaalen banani shuru ho jaati thim
 To understand the fire spreading in Uttarakhand, you have to understand about the forest panchayats
 gram panchayaton ke bare main to aapane suna hi he
 You must have heard about forest panchayats but have forgotten
 sarkaar bhi bhul gai he or van adhikari bhi
 In 1931, the British Government made the Kumaon Panchayat Forest Rules
 pahaado ke logon ko wanon ke prabandhan kaa jimmaa diya gaya
 It is said that 12,600 forests are made in Uttarakhand and they are also empowered under a law
 asaliyat yah he ki in van panchayaton kaa koi ata pataa nahin he
 Had it been active, it would not have to rain water from helicopters to extinguish the fire today

 Van panchayats used to prepare to extinguish the fire from the month of december-january which is no longer there
 jab tak logon kaa jangalon par adhikaar nahin hoga tab tak ve jangal ko apana kyon samajhenge
 Many times they have been deprived of the law and many times people are not able to make biological connections to these forests due to being implicated in the name of law
 vahaan ke logon ke liye bhi jangal utane hi paraaye hai jitne aap or ham paryatakon ke liye
 You have to think how the society that has been living with the forest for centuries has become so unknown
 ye dooriyaan aaj kii nahin hai, ye bhi dashakon se hamane banaai hai
 There is also a song
 yun banja burasaan rakkha jagavaali, yun kaa pattiyon maa doodh, jadon maa pani
 This means guarding the oak burras because they have water in the roots and milk in the leaves
 ab ham pani kahin or se uda kar laa rahe hai
 In their time, the British started building fire lines along the road of traffic
 jinhen hindi main aag suraksha pattee kehete hai
 It used to be a kind of pit where the forest department used to collect leaves and burn them in november-december
 chid kii sukhi pattiyaan samaapt ho jaati thim
 The fire did not spread in the november-december humidity
 garmi main ek tili se fail gai
 Does the forest department not have sufficient staff now? ab ye sab kaam to mobile ap se nahin hoga
 Will be with man and man will be related to society and government only
 kai jagahon par aag suraksha pattiyaan banati bhi nahin hai
 This shows that the Forest Department, which is still doing a lot of work, was lost somewhere else at that time
 log bhi pattiyon ko chun laate the
 But now the law is afraid of sarkaar jitna bhi aashwaasan de unhen pataa he ki koi dhara aisi hogi jiskaa istemaal kar liya jayega
 Sachchidananda Bharati said one thing
 aag chid nahin lagaataa he
 The fire burns
 chid kii pattee ko pirul kehete hai
 Once upon a time, people of Uttarakhand used to make coal from this Pirul
 ab kanoon ke bhay ke kaaran koyala nahin bana pate
 Previously, they used to select pine leaves for making coal
 ek bade se dibbe main band kar pattiyon ko jalaayaa jaataa tha
 The carbon escaped and coal was left
 sookhe patton ke upyog ko rojgaar se nahin jodenge to kitne lakh karmchaaree lagaakar aap in patton ko chunavaayenge
 If you understand this basic thing, then you can get the root of the problem
 ab ye pratha khatm ho gai
 Uttarakhand Additional Chief Secretary s Ramaswamy said that there were 121 fire incidents on 3 May
 95 ko kaabo kar liya gaya he
 At present, the number of active fires is reported to be 26
 somvaar ko yah sankhya 40 thi
 70 on Sunday
 isse sanket mil rahaa he ki aag ke bade hisse par niyantran paa liya gaya he
 For this, 11,160 employees of the state have been employed
 rashtriya or rajya aapadaa prabandhan bal ke log bhi kaam main jute hai
 The Mi-17 helicopter has taken 16 flights to Nainital and Pauri
 chaar logon kii maut ho chuki he or 16 ghayal bataaye ja rahe hai
 So far, 1591 incidents of Vanagni have been reported
 jaanboojh kar aag lagane ke 46 maamle darj kiye gaye hai
 The same situation is in Himachal Pradesh
 vahaan ke 12 main se 8 zilon main dawanal fail chukaa he
 Fire incidents have been reported in the state since a month
 aag pichley saal bhi lagi thi
 It takes place every year
 is baar zyada bade paimaane par lagi he lekin ham aise jaage hai jaise pehali baar lagi ho
 The damage that has been done to the forests from the environment is not going to be compensated so easily and quickly
 vaise ham sochate hai ki is aag main sirf jangal jalte hai lekin aisa nahin he, pashu-pakshiyon kaa bhi is aag main bhayanak nuksaan hota he jo jangal kii aag main ghir jate hai
 Especially the eggs of birds, etc
 are burnt
 reptiles yani sarisrup prajati ke jaanavar iskaa bada shikaar banate hai jo jangal main aag kii se baahar nahin nikal pate, saath hi kai bade jaanavar bhi is aag se batch nahin pate
 Apart from the institutions made by humans, another responsible is the pine
 kai logon ne kaha ki chid ke kaaran dawanal failaa he
 The forest fire is called forest fire
 kya chid ke kaaran hi sab kuch hua
 Is this the villain? ham ek aise samay main rah rahe hai jahaan suchanaaen rocket kii raftaar se aa rahi hai or chali ja rahi hai
 You must have seen pine trees
 aahen bhari hongi
 Fire is coming out from these trees
 susheel bahuguna ne chid ke pedo ke bare main uplabdh jaankariyon kii cheerfaad kii he
 What we want to tell you here
 chid ek conipheras yani shankudhari ped he
 Its leaves are pointed
 pahaado main ye ped aath sau meter se 1800 meter kii oonchai tak hota he
 There is a general belief that, like Eucalyptus, the British brought the pine from Europe, but it is not so
 chid kaa ped karodon saal se himalay ke pahari ilaakon main paaya jaataa he or himalay ke jangalon ko banane main isaki ek badi bhoomika rahi he
 The comments chid ko kudarat ne darasal aisi jagahon ke liye viksit kiya jahaan tikhi dhalaan hon, chattani ilaaka ho, mitti kii parat bahut kam ho yaa naa ke baraabar ho, pani bahut kam ho, tej or sidhi dhoop aati ho
 Pine was prepared by nature for such mountain slopes, therefore pine is also needed to maintain balance in the ecology
 chid kaa vyavsaayik istemaal bhi khub hota he
 The wood of this tree is used in building houses and other works
 chid kii kuch prajatiyon kii lakdi kaagaz banane ke kaam bhi aati he
 The resin that comes out of it is also useful
 isiike distilation se tarapentine oil banataa he
 The question is why the pine tree is becoming a cause of fire in the jungles of the mountains
 darasal vyavsaayik kaarnon se chid kaa bade paimaane par plantesan hua
 Earlier, along with the plantation, the pine was harvested for timber, but after 1981 the cutting of all kinds of trees was stopped after 1000 meters
 iskaa sabase zyaada faaydaa chid ne uthaaya
 He also settled in forests of mixed vegetation like banj, burras and cedars
 dhire-dhire chid ne baaki prajatiyon ke pedo kii jagah lenaa shuru kar diya
 One peculiarity of pine is that it does not allow any other species of tree to grow around it
 chid ko jab in jangalon main kaata nahin gaya to usne chaudee pattee ke jangalon kii jagah chhinani shuru kar di
 The result was that the expansion of the pine greatly increased
 is vistaar kii vajah se jangalon main aag kaa bhi vistaar hua kyonki chid kaa ped jangal main aag ko tezi se failaata he
 When the pine leaves dry, they catch fire very quickly
 garmiyon main chid kii pattiyaan jangalon main ek carpet kii tarah fail jaati hai or ek halki si chingaari bhi badi aag kii shakl main tezi se failane lagati he
 The resin from the pine which is called LISA also acts as a fire
 chid ke jangalon se faili ye aag duusari vanaspatiyon ko jala detii he
 Pine forests do not work much for animals and birds either
 chid kii pattiyaan pinic acid banaati hai jisase mitti acidic ho jaati he
 Pine trees are not much capable of preventing soil erosion from rain
 chid ke jangalon main jal strot suukh jate hai, kyonki mitti main nami qaayam nahin rah paati
 But this expansion of pine was due to human reasons, so it would not be right to call pine as the villain of the forest
 jahaan kuch or nahin hota vahaan chid hota he or wo bada jangal banaata he
 We gave him a place to grow in places that were not his
 bharti ji ne bataaya ki agar ye chaal khaalen bani hoti to aaj helicopter se aag bujhane kii morrkhtaa nahin kerani padati
 That is why we are flying helicopters because we stopped making motion skins
 chennai isiilie to dub gaya kyonki hamane talabon ko bhar kar vahaan apartment bana diye
 Wherever we should be ashamed of our old antics, but our focus is on the pictures of the heroic heroic images
 isse aane vaali awaz hamaare bheetar romaanch paidaa karti he ki ham apane samay main prakruti kii har sharaarat par kaabo paa sakate hai
 The same helicopter was also flying in Chennai
 is helicopter ke udne kaa yahi matlab he ki hamane apni dharti jangal kaa itnaa nuksaan kar diya he ki ram bharose se pehle ab sena kaa hi bharosa he or sena ke jawan puri mustaidi se ye kaam karte bhi hai
 Lives of life
 aap dekhiye ki uttarakhand ke jangalon main lagi aag ko bujhane ke liye helicopter kahaan se pani bhar kar ud rahe hai
 The name of that place is Bhimtal
 yaheen se pani bharte hai or aag bujhaate hai
 If a sufficient number of tricks and skins had been made, it might not have happened
 chaal khaalon kaa zikr aapako hamaari sarkaron kii yojanaon main yaa to nahin milegaa yaa milegaa bhi to naam ke liye
 Now people do not even know about the chawls and not even the forest officials
 bihar main kosi main baadh ai thi
 Remember how many people drowned because they forgot to swim there
 jabaki kosi ke har kisse main naav or tairne waalon kaa zikr miltaa he
 Another Gandhian Anupam Mishra wrote that the sinking society is sinking
 chaal khaal kii tasviir bataa rahi he ki jal rahe hai jangal kyonki bhul gaya he uttarakhand aag bujhane kii apni hi tarkeeb
 When the forest panchayats were active, chal skins started being formed during the rainy days
 uttarakhand main faili aag ko samajhane ke liye aapako van panchayaton ke bare main samajhnaa hi padegaa
 You have already heard about gram panchayats
 van panchayaton ke bare main bhi suna hoga magar bhul gaye honge
 The government has forgotten and the forest officer too
 1931 main british sarkaar ne kumaun panchayat van niyam banaae
 The people of the mountains were given the responsibility of managing the forests
 kaha jaataa he ki uttarakhand main 12,600 van pachaanyate bani hai or inhen ek kanoon ke tahat adhikaar bhi diya gaya he
 The fact is that there is no trace of these Van Panchayats
 agar ye sakriy hoti to aaj aag bujhane ke liye helicopter se pani kii barsaat nahin kerani padati
 Army does not have to call
 pahaado main teen tarah kii zamin hoti he
 The government has a land
 inhen kwas van forest kehete hai yani jangle ke jangal
 The other land used to be called Civil Soyam Bhoomi
 is par gaanv kaa niyantran hota he lekin sarkaar bhi shaamil hoti he
 The government also helps in planting forest or fodder vegetation
 teesri bhoomi hoti he jo gaanv kii apni bhoomi hoti he
 People plant a forest on that land
 class van yani sarkari zamin chhod kar baaki zamin par van panchayaton kaa gathan hota he
 They do not have a budget, but from every family in the village, one person is a member of the Van Panchayat
 van panchayat main pachaas fisadi purush or pachaas fisadi mahilaon kaa hona anivaary he
 If the government had implemented its plans for forests through these forest panchayats, it would have continued to have a relationship between the forest officer, local departments and the common people through the forest panchayat
 van panchayatein disambar-janvari ke maheene se aag bujhane kii taiyaari kar leti thim jo ab nahin hoti he
 Until the people have the right over the forests, why would they consider the forest as their own
 kai baar kanoon se unhen vanchit kiya gaya he or kai baar kanoon ke naam par fansaa diye jane ke kaaran log in jangalon se jaivik sambandh nahin bana pate hai
 The forests are as alien to the people there as for you and us tourists
 aapako sochna to padegaa ki jo samaaj sadiyon se jangal ke saath ji rahaa he wo itnaa anjaan kaise ho gaya
 These distances are not today, we have also made these decades
 ek geet bhi he
 Yun Banja Burasan Rakha Jagwali, Yun's leaves mother milk, roots water
 iskaa matlab yah hua ki banj burans kii rakhwali isliye karo kyonki inaki jadon main pani he or pattiyon main doodh he
 Now we are bringing water from somewhere else
 angrezon ne apane samay main yatayaat ke maarg ke kinare fire line banani shuru kii
 Which are called fire protection bandage in Hindi
 yah ek tarah kaa gaddha hi hota tha jahaan pattiyon ko jamaa kar van vibhaag november-disambar main jala detaa tha
 Dry pine leaves were eliminated
 november-disambar kii nami main aag failati bhi nahin thi
 In summer, a stick spread
 kya pataa van vibhaag ke paas ab paryaapt karmchaaree bhi na ho
 Now all this will not work with the mobile app
 aadmi se hoga or aadmi kaa rishta samaaj or sarkaar se hoga tabhi hoga
 Fire safety straps are not even made in many places
 isse pataa chalata he ki van vibhaag jo abhi kaaphi kaam karata hua dikh rahaa he us vakt kahin or khoyaa hua tha
 People also used to pick leaves
 magar ab kanoon kaa dar sataata he
 Whatever assurance the government gives, they know that there will be such a clause which will be used
 sachchidanand bharti ne ek baat kahi
 Does not set fire
 aag to tili lagaati he
 Pine leaf is called Pirul
 ek jamaane main uttarakhand ke log is pirul se koyala bana lete the
 Now due to fear of law, we are unable to make coal
 pehle koyala banane ke liye chid kii pattiyon ko chun laate the
 The leaves were lit in a large box
 carbon baahar nikal jaataa tha or koyala bachaa rah jaataa tha
 If you do not associate the use of dry leaves with employment, then by applying how many employees, you will choose these leaves
 is buniyadi baat ko samajhenge to samasya kii jad pakad sakate hai
 Now this practice is over
 uttarakhand ke apper mukhya sachiv es ramasvami ne kaha ki 3 may ko aag lagane kii 121 ghatnaayen hui hai
 95 has been controlled
 is vakt sakriy aag kii sankhya 26 bataai ja rahi he
 The number was 40 on Monday
 ravivaar ko 70
 This indicates that large parts of the fire have been controlled
 iske liye rajya ke 11,160 karmchaariyon ko kaam main lagaaya gaya he
 People from national and state disaster management forces are also working
 emai-17 helicopter ne nainital or paudi main 16 udaanen bhari hai
 Four people have died and 16 are said to be injured
 abhi tak vanagni kii 1591 ghatnaayen darj ho chuki hai
 46 cases of willful fire have been registered
 vahi haal himachal pradesh kaa he
 In 8 of the 12 districts there, the forest cover has been spread
 ek maheene se soobe main aag kii ghatnaayen darj ho rahi hai
 The fire was also set last year
 har saal lagati he
 This time it is engaged on a much larger scale, but we are awake like it was the first time
 paryaavaran se lekar jangalon kaa jo nuksaan hua he uski bharpai itani aasaani or jaldi to nahin hone vaali
 By the way, we think that in this fire only forests are burnt, but it is not so, animals and birds also suffer terrible losses in this fire
 khaastaur par pakshiyon ke andey vagairah jal jate hai
 Reptiles, the animals of the reptile species, become the big prey of this, who are not able to get out of the fire in the forest, as well as many big animals do not survive this fire
 insaanon kii banaai sansthaaon ke alaava ek or zimmedaar he chid
 Many people said that the pineapple has spread due to pine
 dawanal jangalon kii aag ko kehete hai
 Did everything happen due to pine? kya ye khalanaayak hi he
 We are living in a time where information is coming and going at rocket speed
 aapane chid ke pedo ko dekha hoga
 Sighs will be filled
 inhen pedo se aag nikal rahi he
 Sushil Bahuguna has disseminated the available information about pine trees
 jo ham aapako yahaan bataanaa chaahate hai
 Pine is a coniferous tree
 isaki pattiyaan nukili hoti hai
 These trees range from eight hundred meters to 1800 meters in the mountains
 ek aam dharna he ki eucalyptus kii tarah chid ko bhi angrez europe se lekar aae, lekin aisa nahin he
 Pine tree has been found in the Himalayan hills for millions of years and has played a major role in creating the Himalayan forests
 tippaniyan Nature has been developed for places where there are steep slopes, rocky terrain, little or no soil layer, very little water, strong and direct sunlight
 aisi pahari dhalaanon ke liye chid ko prakruti ne taiyaar kiya tha, isiilie paristhitiki main santulan banaae rakhane ke liye chid kii bhi zarurat he
 Pine is also used commercially
 is ped kii lakdi makaan banane or duusare kaamon main istemaal hoti he
 Wood of some species of pine is also used in paper making
 isse nikalne vaala racin yani lisa bhi kai kaam aata he
 Its distillation produces turpentine oil
 sawaal ye he ki itane kaam kaa ped chid kyon pahaado ke jangalon main aag kii ek vajah ban rahaa he
 Actually, due to commercial reasons, there was large scale plantation of pine
 pehle plantesan ke saath-saath chid ko timber ke liye kaata bhi jaataa tha, lekin 1981 ke baad 1000 meter ke baad har tarah ke ped ke kaatane par roak lag gai
 Chir took the most advantage of it
 wo banj, burans or deodaar jaise mishrit vanaspati ke jangalon main bhi bas gaya
 Gradually the pine began to replace the trees of the rest of the species
 chid kii ek khaasiyat ye he ki wo apane aasapaas kisi duusari prajati ke ped ko panpane nahin detaa
 When the pine was not harvested in these forests, it started snatching the place of broad leaf forests
 nateeja ye hua ki chid kaa vistaar bahut bad gaya
 Due to this expansion, the fire in the forests also expanded because the pine tree spreads the fire in the forest rapidly
 chid kii pattiyaan jab suukh jaati hai to badi tezi se aag pakadati hai
 In summer, the pine leaves spread like a carpet in the forests, and a slight spark also spreads rapidly in the form of a large fire
 chid se nikalne vaala rezin jise lisa kehete hai wo bhi aag bhadakaane kaa kaam karata he
 These fires spread from pine forests burn other flora
 chid ke jangal pashu-pakshiyon ke bhi zyaada kaam nahin aate
 Pine leaves make pineic acid, which makes the soil acidic
 chid ke ped barish se mitti kaa kataav rokane main zyada sakasham nahin hote
 Water sources in the pine forests dry up, because moisture in the soil is unable to be retained
 lekin chid kaa ye vistaar insaani vajahon se hua, isliye chid ko jangal kaa villen kahana thik nahin hoga
 Where nothing else happens there is a pine and it makes a big forest
 hamane hi use un jagahon par panpane ke liye jagah di jo jagah uski nahin thi
 You will not find any mention of trick skins in the schemes of our governments or even for the name
 ab logon ko bhi chaal khaal ke bare main pataa nahin he or van adhikariyon ko bhi nahin
 Kosi was flooded in Bihar
 yaad kiijie kitne log dub kar mar gaye isliye ki vahaan ke log tairnaa bhul gaye the
 Whereas in every story of Kosi, there is mention of boat and swimmers
 ek or gandhivadi anupam mishra ne likhaa tha ki dub rahaa he tairne vaala samaaj
 The picture of the trick skin is telling that the forests are burning because Uttarakhand has forgotten its own way to extinguish the fire
 van panchayatein jab sakriy hoti thi tab barish ke dinon main hi chaal khaalen banani shuru ho jaati thim
 To understand the fire spreading in Uttarakhand, you have to understand about the forest panchayats
 gram panchayaton ke bare main to aapane suna hi he
 You must have heard about forest panchayats but have forgotten
 sarkaar bhi bhul gai he or van adhikari bhi
 In 1931, the British Government made the Kumaon Panchayat Forest Rules

 It is said that 12,600 forests are made in Uttarakhand and they are also empowered under a law
 asaliyat yah he ki in van panchayaton kaa koi ata pataa nahin he

 It is compulsory to have fifty percent males and fifty percent females in Van Panchayat

 Van panchayats used to prepare to extinguish the fire from the month of december-january which is no longer there
 jab tak logon kaa jangalon par adhikaar nahin hoga tab tak ve jangal ko apana kyon samajhenge
 Many times they have been deprived of the law and many times people are not able to make biological connections to these forests due to being implicated in the name of law
 vahaan ke logon ke liye bhi jangal utane hi paraaye hai jitne aap or ham paryatakon ke liye
 You have to think how the society that has been living with the forest for centuries has become so unknown
 ye dooriyaan aaj kii nahin hai, ye bhi dashakon se hamane banaai hai
 There is also a song
 yun banja burasaan rakkha jagavaali, yun kaa pattiyon maa doodh, jadon maa pani
 This means guarding the oak burras because they have water in the roots and milk in the leaves
 ab ham pani kahin or se uda kar laa rahe hai
 In their time, the British started building fire lines along the road of traffic
 jinhen hindi main aag suraksha pattee kehete hai
 It used to be a kind of pit where the forest department used to collect leaves and burn them in november-december
 chid kii sukhi pattiyaan samaapt ho jaati thim
 The fire did not spread in the november-december humidity
 garmi main ek tili se fail gai
 Does the forest department not have sufficient staff now? ab ye sab kaam to mobile ap se nahin hoga
 Will be with man and man will be related to society and government only
 kai jagahon par aag suraksha pattiyaan banati bhi nahin hai
 This shows that the Forest Department, which is still doing a lot of work, was lost somewhere else at that time
 log bhi pattiyon ko chun laate the
 But now the law is afraid of sarkaar jitna bhi aashwaasan de unhen pataa he ki koi dhara aisi hogi jiskaa istemaal kar liya jayega
 Sachchidananda Bharati said one thing

 Especially the eggs of birds, etc
 are burnt
 reptiles yani sarisrup prajati ke jaanavar iskaa bada shikaar banate hai jo jangal main aag kii se baahar nahin nikal pate, saath hi kai bade jaanavar bhi is aag se batch nahin pate
 Apart from the institutions made by humans, another responsible is the pine
 kai logon ne kaha ki chid ke kaaran dawanal failaa he
 The forest fire is called forest fire
 kya chid ke kaaran hi sab kuch hua
 Is this the villain? ham ek aise samay main rah rahe hai jahaan suchanaaen rocket kii raftaar se aa rahi hai or chali ja rahi hai
 You must have seen pine trees
 aahen bhari hongi
 Fire is coming out from these trees
 susheel bahuguna ne chid ke pedo ke bare main uplabdh jaankariyon kii cheerfaad kii he
 What we want to tell you here
 chid ek conipheras yani shankudhari ped he
 Its leaves are pointed
 pahaado main ye ped aath sau meter se 1800 meter kii oonchai tak hota he
 There is a general belief that, like Eucalyptus, the British brought the pine from Europe, but it is not so
 chid kaa ped karodon saal se himalay ke pahari ilaakon main paaya jaataa he or himalay ke jangalon ko banane main isaki ek badi bhoomika rahi he
 The comments chid ko kudarat ne darasal aisi jagahon ke liye viksit kiya jahaan tikhi dhalaan hon, chattani ilaaka ho, mitti kii parat bahut kam ho yaa naa ke baraabar ho, pani bahut kam ho, tej or sidhi dhoop aati ho
 Pine was prepared by nature for such mountain slopes, therefore pine is also needed to maintain balance in the ecology
 chid kaa vyavsaayik istemaal bhi khub hota he
 The wood of this tree is used in building houses and other works
 chid kii kuch prajatiyon kii lakdi kaagaz banane ke kaam bhi aati he
 The resin that comes out of it is also useful
 isiike distilation se tarapentine oil banataa he
 The question is why the pine tree is becoming a cause of fire in the jungles of the mountains
 darasal vyavsaayik kaarnon se chid kaa bade paimaane par plantesan hua
 Earlier, along with the plantation, the pine was harvested for timber, but after 1981 the cutting of all kinds of trees was stopped after 1000 meters
 iskaa sabase zyaada faaydaa chid ne uthaaya
 He also settled in forests of mixed vegetation like banj, burras and cedars
 dhire-dhire chid ne baaki prajatiyon ke pedo kii jagah lenaa shuru kar diya
 One peculiarity of pine is that it does not allow any other species of tree to grow around it
 chid ko jab in jangalon main kaata nahin gaya to usne chaudee pattee ke jangalon kii jagah chhinani shuru kar di
 The result was that the expansion of the pine greatly increased
 is vistaar kii vajah se jangalon main aag kaa bhi vistaar hua kyonki chid kaa ped jangal main aag ko tezi se failaata he
 When the pine leaves dry, they catch fire very quickly
 garmiyon main chid kii pattiyaan jangalon main ek carpet kii tarah fail jaati hai or ek halki si chingaari bhi badi aag kii shakl main tezi se failane lagati he
 The resin from the pine which is called LISA also acts as a fire
 chid ke jangalon se faili ye aag duusari vanaspatiyon ko jala detii he
 Pine forests do not work much for animals and birds either
 chid kii pattiyaan pinic acid banaati hai jisase mitti acidic ho jaati he
 Pine trees are not much capable of preventing soil erosion from rain
 chid ke jangalon main jal strot suukh jate hai, kyonki mitti main nami qaayam nahin rah paati
 But this expansion of pine was due to human reasons, so it would not be right to call pine as the villain of the forest
 jahaan kuch or nahin hota vahaan chid hota he or wo bada jangal banaata he
 We gave him a place to grow in places that were not his
 gram panchayaton ke bare main to aapane suna hi he
 You must have heard about forest panchayats but have forgotten
 sarkaar bhi bhul gai he or van adhikari bhi
 In 1931, the British Government made the Kumaon Panchayat Forest Rules
 pahaado ke logon ko wanon ke prabandhan kaa jimmaa diya gaya
 It is said that 12,600 forests are made in Uttarakhand and they are also empowered under a law
 asaliyat yah he ki in van panchayaton kaa koi ata pataa nahin he
 Had it been active, it would not have to rain water from helicopters to extinguish the fire today
 sena bulani nahin padati
 There are three types of land in the mountains
 ek zamin hoti he sarkaar kii
 These are called quas forest forests i
e
 jungle forest
 duusari zamin hoti jise civil soyam bhoomi kehete hai
 The village is controlled by this but the government is also involved
 jangal yaa chaare kii vanaspati lagane main sarkaar bhi madad karti he
 The third land is the village's own land
 us zamin par log jangal lagaate hai
 Forest Panchayats are formed on the remaining land leaving class one i
e
 government land
 inkaa koi bajet nahin hota magar gaanv ke har parivaar se ek vyakti van panchayat kaa sadsy hota he
 It is compulsory to have fifty percent males and fifty percent females in Van Panchayat
 agar sarkaar wanon ke liye apni yojanaon ko in van panchayaton ke zariye lagu karaati, sakriy rakhti to van adhikari, sthaneey vibhaagon or van panchayat ke zariye aam logon ke bich ek rishta jari rahata
 Van panchayats used to prepare to extinguish the fire from the month of december-january which is no longer there
 jab tak logon kaa jangalon par adhikaar nahin hoga tab tak ve jangal ko apana kyon samajhenge
 Many times they have been deprived of the law and many times people are not able to make biological connections to these forests due to being implicated in the name of law
 vahaan ke logon ke liye bhi jangal utane hi paraaye hai jitne aap or ham paryatakon ke liye
 You have to think how the society that has been living with the forest for centuries has become so unknown
 ye dooriyaan aaj kii nahin hai, ye bhi dashakon se hamane banaai hai
 There is also a song
 yun banja burasaan rakkha jagavaali, yun kaa pattiyon maa doodh, jadon maa pani
 This means guarding the oak burras because they have water in the roots and milk in the leaves
 ab ham pani kahin or se uda kar laa rahe hai
 In their time, the British started building fire lines along the road of traffic
 jinhen hindi main aag suraksha pattee kehete hai
 It used to be a kind of pit where the forest department used to collect leaves and burn them in november-december
 chid kii sukhi pattiyaan samaapt ho jaati thim
 The fire did not spread in the november-december humidity
 garmi main ek tili se fail gai
 Does the forest department not have sufficient staff now? ab ye sab kaam to mobile ap se nahin hoga
 Will be with man and man will be related to society and government only
 kai jagahon par aag suraksha pattiyaan banati bhi nahin hai
 This shows that the Forest Department, which is still doing a lot of work, was lost somewhere else at that time
 log bhi pattiyon ko chun laate the
 But now the law is afraid of sarkaar jitna bhi aashwaasan de unhen pataa he ki koi dhara aisi hogi jiskaa istemaal kar liya jayega
 Sachchidananda Bharati said one thing
 aag chid nahin lagaataa he
 The fire burns
 chid kii pattee ko pirul kehete hai
 Once upon a time, people of Uttarakhand used to make coal from this Pirul
 ab kanoon ke bhay ke kaaran koyala nahin bana pate
 Previously, they used to select pine leaves for making coal
 ek bade se dibbe main band kar pattiyon ko jalaayaa jaataa tha
 The carbon escaped and coal was left
 sookhe patton ke upyog ko rojgaar se nahin jodenge to kitne lakh karmchaaree lagaakar aap in patton ko chunavaayenge
 If you understand this basic thing, then you can get the root of the problem
 ab ye pratha khatm ho gai

 uttarakhand ke apper mukhya sachiv es ramasvami ne kaha ki 3 may ko aag lagane kii 121 ghatnaayen hui hai
 95 has been controlled
 is vakt sakriy aag kii sankhya 26 bataai ja rahi he
 The number was 40 on Monday
 ravivaar ko 70
 This indicates that large parts of the fire have been controlled
 iske liye rajya ke 11,160 karmchaariyon ko kaam main lagaaya gaya he
 People from national and state disaster management forces are also working
 emai-17 helicopter ne nainital or paudi main 16 udaanen bhari hai
 Four people have died and 16 are said to be injured
 abhi tak vanagni kii 1591 ghatnaayen darj ho chuki hai
 46 cases of willful fire have been registered
 vahi haal himachal pradesh kaa he
 In 8 of the 12 districts there, the forest cover has been spread
 ek maheene se soobe main aag kii ghatnaayen darj ho rahi hai
 The fire was also set last year
 har saal lagati he
 This time it is engaged on a much larger scale, but we are awake like it was the first time
 paryaavaran se lekar jangalon kaa jo nuksaan hua he uski bharpai itani aasaani or jaldi to nahin hone vaali
 By the way, we think that in this fire only forests are burnt, but it is not so, animals and birds also suffer terrible losses in this fire
 khaastaur par pakshiyon ke andey vagairah jal jate hai
 Reptiles, the animals of the reptile species, become the big prey of this, who are not able to get out of the fire in the forest, as well as many big animals do not survive this fire
 insaanon kii banaai sansthaaon ke alaava ek or zimmedaar he chid
 Many people said that the pineapple has spread due to pine
 dawanal jangalon kii aag ko kehete hai
 Did everything happen due to pine? kya ye khalanaayak hi he
 We are living in a time where information is coming and going at rocket speed
 aapane chid ke pedo ko dekha hoga
 Sighs will be filled
 inhen pedo se aag nikal rahi he
 Sushil Bahuguna has disseminated the available information about pine trees
 jo ham aapako yahaan bataanaa chaahate hai
 Pine is a coniferous tree
 isaki pattiyaan nukili hoti hai
 These trees range from eight hundred meters to 1800 meters in the mountains
 ek aam dharna he ki eucalyptus kii tarah chid ko bhi angrez europe se lekar aae, lekin aisa nahin he
 Pine tree has been found in the Himalayan hills for millions of years and has played a major role in creating the Himalayan forests
 tippaniyan Nature has been developed for places where there are steep slopes, rocky terrain, little or no soil layer, very little water, strong and direct sunlight
 aisi pahari dhalaanon ke liye chid ko prakruti ne taiyaar kiya tha, isiilie paristhitiki main santulan banaae rakhane ke liye chid kii bhi zarurat he
 Pine is also used commercially
 is ped kii lakdi makaan banane or duusare kaamon main istemaal hoti he
 Wood of some species of pine is also used in paper making
 isse nikalne vaala racin yani lisa bhi kai kaam aata he
 Its distillation produces turpentine oil
 sawaal ye he ki itane kaam kaa ped chid kyon pahaado ke jangalon main aag kii ek vajah ban rahaa he
 Actually, due to commercial reasons, there was large scale plantation of pine
 pehle plantesan ke saath-saath chid ko timber ke liye kaata bhi jaataa tha, lekin 1981 ke baad 1000 meter ke baad har tarah ke ped ke kaatane par roak lag gai
 Chir took the most advantage of it
 wo banj, burans or deodaar jaise mishrit vanaspati ke jangalon main bhi bas gaya
 Gradually the pine began to replace the trees of the rest of the species
 chid kii ek khaasiyat ye he ki wo apane aasapaas kisi duusari prajati ke ped ko panpane nahin detaa
 When the pine was not harvested in these forests, it started snatching the place of broad leaf forests
 nateeja ye hua ki chid kaa vistaar bahut bad gaya
 Due to this expansion, the fire in the forests also expanded because the pine tree spreads the fire in the forest rapidly
 chid kii pattiyaan jab suukh jaati hai to badi tezi se aag pakadati hai
 In summer, the pine leaves spread like a carpet in the forests, and a slight spark also spreads rapidly in the form of a large fire
 chid se nikalne vaala rezin jise lisa kehete hai wo bhi aag bhadakaane kaa kaam karata he
 These fires spread from pine forests burn other flora
 chid ke jangal pashu-pakshiyon ke bhi zyaada kaam nahin aate
 Pine leaves make pineic acid, which makes the soil acidic
 chid ke ped barish se mitti kaa kataav rokane main zyada sakasham nahin hote
 Water sources in the pine forests dry up, because moisture in the soil is unable to be retained
 lekin chid kaa ye vistaar insaani vajahon se hua, isliye chid ko jangal kaa villen kahana thik nahin hoga
 Where nothing else happens there is a pine and it makes a big forest
 hamane hi use un jagahon par panpane ke liye jagah di jo jagah uski nahin thi
 People also used to pick leaves
 magar ab kanoon kaa dar sataata he
 Whatever assurance the government gives, they know that there will be such a clause which will be used
 sachchidanand bharti ne ek baat kahi
 Does not set fire
 aag to tili lagaati he
 Pine leaf is called Pirul
 ek jamaane main uttarakhand ke log is pirul se koyala bana lete the
 Now due to fear of law, we are unable to make coal
 pehle koyala banane ke liye chid kii pattiyon ko chun laate the
 The leaves were lit in a large box
 carbon baahar nikal jaataa tha or koyala bachaa rah jaataa tha
 If you do not associate the use of dry leaves with employment, then by applying how many employees, you will choose these leaves

 abhi tak vanagni kii 1591 ghatnaayen darj ho chuki hai
 46 cases of willful fire have been registered
 vahi haal himachal pradesh kaa he
 In 8 of the 12 districts there, the forest cover has been spread
 ek maheene se soobe main aag kii ghatnaayen darj ho rahi hai
 The fire was also set last year
 har saal lagati he
 This time it is engaged on a much larger scale, but we are awake like it was the first time
 paryaavaran se lekar jangalon kaa jo nuksaan hua he uski bharpai itani aasaani or jaldi to nahin hone vaali
 By the way, we think that in this fire only forests are burnt, but it is not so, animals and birds also suffer terrible losses in this fire
 khaastaur par pakshiyon ke andey vagairah jal jate hai
 Reptiles, the animals of the reptile species, become the big prey of this, who are not able to get out of the fire in the forest, as well as many big animals do not survive this fire
 insaanon kii banaai sansthaaon ke alaava ek or zimmedaar he chid
 Many people said that the pineapple has spread due to pine
 dawanal jangalon kii aag ko kehete hai
 Did everything happen due to pine? kya ye khalanaayak hi he
 We are living in a time where information is coming and going at rocket speed
 aapane chid ke pedo ko dekha hoga
 Sighs will be filled
 inhen pedo se aag nikal rahi he
 Sushil Bahuguna has disseminated the available information about pine trees
 jo ham aapako yahaan bataanaa chaahate hai
 Pine is a coniferous tree
 isaki pattiyaan nukili hoti hai
 These trees range from eight hundred meters to 1800 meters in the mountains
 ek aam dharna he ki eucalyptus kii tarah chid ko bhi angrez europe se lekar aae, lekin aisa nahin he
 Pine tree has been found in the Himalayan hills for millions of years and has played a major role in creating the Himalayan forests
 tippaniyan Nature has been developed for places where there are steep slopes, rocky terrain, little or no soil layer, very little water, strong and direct sunlight
 aisi pahari dhalaanon ke liye chid ko prakruti ne taiyaar kiya tha, isiilie paristhitiki main santulan banaae rakhane ke liye chid kii bhi zarurat he
 Pine is also used commercially
 is ped kii lakdi makaan banane or duusare kaamon main istemaal hoti he
 Wood of some species of pine is also used in paper making
 isse nikalne vaala racin yani lisa bhi kai kaam aata he
 Its distillation produces turpentine oil
 sawaal ye he ki itane kaam kaa ped chid kyon pahaado ke jangalon main aag kii ek vajah ban rahaa he
 Actually, due to commercial reasons, there was large scale plantation of pine
 pehle plantesan ke saath-saath chid ko timber ke liye kaata bhi jaataa tha, lekin 1981 ke baad 1000 meter ke baad har tarah ke ped ke kaatane par roak lag gai
 Chir took the most advantage of it
 wo banj, burans or deodaar jaise mishrit vanaspati ke jangalon main bhi bas gaya
 Gradually the pine began to replace the trees of the rest of the species
 chid kii ek khaasiyat ye he ki wo apane aasapaas kisi duusari prajati ke ped ko panpane nahin detaa
 When the pine was not harvested in these forests, it started snatching the place of broad leaf forests
 nateeja ye hua ki chid kaa vistaar bahut bad gaya
 Due to this expansion, the fire in the forests also expanded because the pine tree spreads the fire in the forest rapidly
 chid kii pattiyaan jab suukh jaati hai to badi tezi se aag pakadati hai
 In summer, the pine leaves spread like a carpet in the forests, and a slight spark also spreads rapidly in the form of a large fire
 chid se nikalne vaala rezin jise lisa kehete hai wo bhi aag bhadakaane kaa kaam karata he
 These fires spread from pine forests burn other flora
 chid ke jangal pashu-pakshiyon ke bhi zyaada kaam nahin aate
 Pine leaves make pineic acid, which makes the soil acidic
 chid ke ped barish se mitti kaa kataav rokane main zyada sakasham nahin hote
 Water sources in the pine forests dry up, because moisture in the soil is unable to be retained
 lekin chid kaa ye vistaar insaani vajahon se hua, isliye chid ko jangal kaa villen kahana thik nahin hoga
 Where nothing else happens there is a pine and it makes a big forest
 hamane hi use un jagahon par panpane ke liye jagah di jo jagah uski nahin thi
 Uttarakhand Additional Chief Secretary s Ramaswamy said that there were 121 fire incidents on 3 May
 95 ko kaabo kar liya gaya he
 At present, the number of active fires is reported to be 26
 somvaar ko yah sankhya 40 thi
 70 on Sunday
 isse sanket mil rahaa he ki aag ke bade hisse par niyantran paa liya gaya he
 For this, 11,160 employees of the state have been employed
 rashtriya or rajya aapadaa prabandhan bal ke log bhi kaam main jute hai
 The Mi-17 helicopter has taken 16 flights to Nainital and Pauri
 chaar logon kii maut ho chuki he or 16 ghayal bataaye ja rahe hai
 So far, 1591 incidents of Vanagni have been reported
 jaanboojh kar aag lagane ke 46 maamle darj kiye gaye hai
 The same situation is in Himachal Pradesh
 vahaan ke 12 main se 8 zilon main dawanal fail chukaa he
 Fire incidents have been reported in the state since a month
 aag pichley saal bhi lagi thi
 It takes place every year
 is baar zyada bade paimaane par lagi he lekin ham aise jaage hai jaise pehali baar lagi ho
 The damage that has been done to the forests from the environment is not going to be compensated so easily and quickly
 vaise ham sochate hai ki is aag main sirf jangal jalte hai lekin aisa nahin he, pashu-pakshiyon kaa bhi is aag main bhayanak nuksaan hota he jo jangal kii aag main ghir jate hai
 Especially the eggs of birds, etc
 are burnt
 reptiles yani sarisrup prajati ke jaanavar iskaa bada shikaar banate hai jo jangal main aag kii se baahar nahin nikal pate, saath hi kai bade jaanavar bhi is aag se batch nahin pate
 Apart from the institutions made by humans, another responsible is the pine
 kai logon ne kaha ki chid ke kaaran dawanal failaa he
 The forest fire is called forest fire
 kya chid ke kaaran hi sab kuch hua
 Is this the villain? ham ek aise samay main rah rahe hai jahaan suchanaaen rocket kii raftaar se aa rahi hai or chali ja rahi hai
 You must have seen pine trees
 aahen bhari hongi
 Fire is coming out from these trees
 susheel bahuguna ne chid ke pedo ke bare main uplabdh jaankariyon kii cheerfaad kii he
 What we want to tell you here
 chid ek conipheras yani shankudhari ped he
 Its leaves are pointed
 pahaado main ye ped aath sau meter se 1800 meter kii oonchai tak hota he
 There is a general belief that, like Eucalyptus, the British brought the pine from Europe, but it is not so
 chid kaa ped karodon saal se himalay ke pahari ilaakon main paaya jaataa he or himalay ke jangalon ko banane main isaki ek badi bhoomika rahi he
 The comments chid ko kudarat ne darasal aisi jagahon ke liye viksit kiya jahaan tikhi dhalaan hon, chattani ilaaka ho, mitti kii parat bahut kam ho yaa naa ke baraabar ho, pani bahut kam ho, tej or sidhi dhoop aati ho
 Pine was prepared by nature for such mountain slopes, therefore pine is also needed to maintain balance in the ecology
 chid kaa vyavsaayik istemaal bhi khub hota he
 The wood of this tree is used in building houses and other works
 chid kii kuch prajatiyon kii lakdi kaagaz banane ke kaam bhi aati he
 The resin that comes out of it is also useful
 isiike distilation se tarapentine oil banataa he
 The question is why the pine tree is becoming a cause of fire in the jungles of the mountains
 darasal vyavsaayik kaarnon se chid kaa bade paimaane par plantesan hua
 Earlier, along with the plantation, the pine was harvested for timber, but after 1981 the cutting of all kinds of trees was stopped after 1000 meters
 iskaa sabase zyaada faaydaa chid ne uthaaya
 He also settled in forests of mixed vegetation like banj, burras and cedars
 dhire-dhire chid ne baaki prajatiyon ke pedo kii jagah lenaa shuru kar diya
 One peculiarity of pine is that it does not allow any other species of tree to grow around it
 chid ko jab in jangalon main kaata nahin gaya to usne chaudee pattee ke jangalon kii jagah chhinani shuru kar di
 The result was that the expansion of the pine greatly increased
 is vistaar kii vajah se jangalon main aag kaa bhi vistaar hua kyonki chid kaa ped jangal main aag ko tezi se failaata he
 When the pine leaves dry, they catch fire very quickly
 garmiyon main chid kii pattiyaan jangalon main ek carpet kii tarah fail jaati hai or ek halki si chingaari bhi badi aag kii shakl main tezi se failane lagati he
 The resin from the pine which is called LISA also acts as a fire
 chid ke jangalon se faili ye aag duusari vanaspatiyon ko jala detii he
 Pine forests do not work much for animals and birds either
 chid kii pattiyaan pinic acid banaati hai jisase mitti acidic ho jaati he
 Pine trees are not much capable of preventing soil erosion from rain
 chid ke jangalon main jal strot suukh jate hai, kyonki mitti main nami qaayam nahin rah paati
 But this expansion of pine was due to human reasons, so it would not be right to call pine as the villain of the forest
 jahaan kuch or nahin hota vahaan chid hota he or wo bada jangal banaata he
 We gave him a place to grow in places that were not his

 Let us know that Priyanka Gandhi had entered active politics before the Lok Sabha elections
 congress ne us samay priyanka gandhi ko rashtriya mahasachiv banaate hue purvi uttar pradesh ke prabharee niyukt kiya tha
 Jyotiraditya Scindia along with Priyanka was put in charge of West UP
 loksabhaa chunaav main congress kii karaari haar ke baad sindhiya ne apane pad se istipha de diya tha, lekin priyanka gandhi ne apana pad nahin choda tha

 Not only this, he is a constant attacker on Yogi and Modi government

 unhone kaha, 'hamaari bhashaa main (thakare bhashaa) main iskaa matlab desh ke pradhanmantri kaa raajnneetik rup se asaksham hona he
 By the way, Thackeray has clarified that the approach of 'time' magazine does not make a man big or small because there is also commercial pressure on this magazine
 kuch samay pehle isi patrika ne gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi ko bharat kaa aisa rajaneta qaraar diya tha, jisase log sabase zyada nafrat karte hai
 Thackeray claimed that but only anti-hindutva forces hate Modi

 The name of the dress code was misbehaved with female students at the Government Women’s College, Patna
 jiske baad chaatraon ne jamkar hangaamaa kiya
 The girls have accused the mail staff of the college for forcibly removing the burqa and checking the dress
 jab parijan shikaayat karne college ke principal ke paas pahunche to unhone yah kahkar beizzat kiya ki kya aapaki beti ke saath rape ho gaya he jo itnaa hangaamaa kar rahe hai
 Female students of Government College gave up their class against the college administration and created a ruckus on the campus against the poor thinking of the college staff and the principal
 unka kahana he ki bina kisi notice ke achaanak principal or college prashasan ne dress code lagu kar diya
 The students did not even know
 iske liye koi notice bhi jari nahin kiya gaya tha
 So most of the students came to college in casual dress
 chaatraon kaa kahana he ki unhen college main ghusane nahin diya ja rahaa tha
 The mail staff of the college was checking the dress by raising the girls Kaburka
 is par chatraayen bhadak gayi
 He alleges that the investigation was done by an employee of the college named Akash instead of a female employee
 chaatraon ne jab jabaran burka uthaakar check karne par akaash kaa virodh kiya to vah chaatraon se badasluki karne laga
 At the same time, Akash did a bad job in the name of dress checking of the passout girl who came to the college to get the result
 jiske baad ladakiyon ne hangaamaa shuru kar diya or checking karne vaale akaash kaa video bhi banaaya
 When the news of a ruckus in the college was received by a student's parent, he immediately reached the college

 unhone purush karmchaaree dwaara dress jaanch kii baat se saaf inkaar kiya or kaha ki akaash naam kaa koi vyakti college main nahin he
 But the students also made a video from the mobile of the man in which he is arguing with the girls during checking

 - Input IANS punjab or goa vidhansabha chunaav main karaari shikast ke baad aam aadmi party ke mukhiya arvind kejariwal kaa mishan gujarat khatai main padataa najar aa rahaa he
 According to Aam Aadmi Party sources, the proposed Aam Aadmi Party's public meeting in Gandhinagar, Gujarat on March 26, has been converted into an activist conference
 punjab ke chunaavon ke pehle kii yojana ke mutabik kejariwal gandhinagar main 26 march ko vishaal jansabha kar gujarat main isi saal hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav kaa bigul foonkane vaale the
 But the results of both the states have destroyed all the aspirations of Kejriwal
 gopal raay sanchalit karenge kaarykramasutron ke mutabik gandhinagar main party ab 26 march ko kaaryakarta sammelan karegi
 At the same time, suspense has been created on Arvind Kejriwal's involvement in this program
 aam aadmi party ke vishwast sutron ke mutabik arvind kejariwal 26 march ko gujarat ke gandhinagar main party ke kaaryakarta samvaad main jane kii yojana radd kar sakate hai
 The entire program will be run by the Gujarat in-charge of the party, Gopal Rai, who is currently camping in Gujarat and is looking at expanding the organization in the state
 emsidi chunaav ke maddenjar daura raddsutron kii maane tokejariwal ke gujarat daureke radd hone kii sambhaavna ke peeche punjab or goa main haar or agle maheene dilli main hone vaale nagar nigam chunaav badi vajah he
 The Corporation election of Delhi has become an election of prestige for Kejriwal
 vahiin emsidi main 10 saal se shashan kar rahi bijepi bhrashtachar or tamaam aaropon ke chalate jabardast anti inakambency kaa saamana kar rahi he
 But after the overwhelming victory in the assembly elections of five states, the Corporation election of Delhi has also become a nose question for the BJP
 jaahir he bijepi or aap donon hi is chunaav main sab kuch daanv par lagane ke liye taiyaar hai
 Challenging the BJP in Gujarat, if it is difficult, then the party feels that the BJP corporation should not make the issue of Kikjeriwal the Gujarat tour just before the election
 saath hi janata main ye sandesh naa jaae ki kejariwal sirf dilli se baahar dhyaan de rahe hai
 Despite losing elections in Punjab and Goa, the Aam Aadmi Party has emerged as the main opposition in Punjab, but almost all the candidates of the party in Goa lost their deposits
 vahiin bijepi ne uttar pradesh or uttarakhand main jeet ke saath goa main bhi sarkaar banaakar ek jabardast maahaul banaaya he
 In such a situation, it can be extremely difficult for Kejriwal to enter and challenge the BJP in Gujarat, which is the stronghold of Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 saath hi agar nigam chunaav main jeet nahin mili to dilli main jahaan unki apni sarkaar he, vahaan bhi unki lokapriyata par sawaal uth sakate hai
 Therefore, speculation is rife that Kejriwal may cancel his plan to participate in the Gujarat event on March 26

 notebandi ke kaaran rajdhani ke mukhya bazaaron kaa kaarobaar bhale hi buree tarah prabhavit hua ho, lekin yahaan chalan se baahar hue hajaar or paanch sau rupee ke note kamishan main badalane kaa dhandha khub falphul rahaa he
 In the capital's wholesale market Chandni Chowk, Fatehpuri and Sadar Bazar, shopkeepers who exchange old and mutilated notes are exchanging notes at a commission of 40 to 50 percent
 sutron ne bataaya ki yah chote dukandaar jahiraa taur par badi rakam kii nakadi nahin badalte hai or ek do note hi badalte hai, lekin kisi sampark athwa bichauliye ke jariye pahunchane par ek lakh rupee kii puraani nakadi par sau-sau rupee kii shakl main 50 hajaar rupee tak mil sakati he
 Experts say that these people tear the old notes first and then convert it to the Reserve Bank before December 30 and will extract the profits
 unhone bataaya ki syndicate ne kamishan par note badalane kaa anupaat kuch is prakaar tay kiya he ki badi rakam par tex or 200 fisad jurmaana dene ke baad bhi unhen kuch phayda mil jayega
 However, the government is completely ready to fight against black money and is making every effort to bring out more and more money illegally by issuing new instructions daily
 khate main dhai lakh rupee tak kii chhot or pan kii anivaarytaaon ke baavjood log kaledhan ke khilaaf jang main bhi kalaadhan banane ke nae-nae upaay talash rahe hai

 According to the announcement of the Commission, by-elections are to be held in five states on 19 November
 rashtriya rajdhani kshetra ke noida or gajiabad ke builder or bhawan nirmaataa bhi kaledhan ko safed banane ke dhandhe main shaamil hai
 The builders still agree to book the flats by accepting old notes, but are also scared of taking full payment for the flats in old cash
 sutron kaa kahana he ki goa main modi dwaara benami sampatti or real estate kshetra main sargical stril kii ashanka se ab builder jald se jald apane flaton ko nikaalane ke chakkar main hai, jiske liye unhone apane daam bhi gata die hai
 Sources said that about 60 per cent of the builders are daily wage laborers and small contractors who are paid daily
 book karaane kii raashi ko badi aasaani se vah tees disambar tak apane dihadi mazdooron ke bich khapa denge
 Apart from this, he is also giving new orders to contractors by paying them in advance

 He said that corruption increases in a 'more regulated' economy
 unhone kaha ki raajnneetik pariprekshya se bank noton ko badalanaa ek smart kadam he
 However, this may stop commercial transactions for some time and slow the economy, but it cannot eliminate corruption deeply
 soraman ne pitiai-bhashaa se saakshaatkaar main kaha, ‘‘atyadhik niyaman vaali arthvyavastha main bhrashtachar badhata he
 Corruption actually revolves around red tape and bureaucracy
 aise main bhrashtachar ko kam karne ke liye niyaman ko kuch kam kiya janaa chahie

 However, he added that the existing high denomination notes will be replaced by new ones
 aise main yah nahin kaha ja saktaa ki bhrashtachar main nakadi kaa istemaal band ho jayega

 jaankaron kaa kahana he ki yah log pehle puraane noton ko faad dete hai or phir use 30 disambar se pehle rigerv bank main badalawakar munafa nikaal lenge

 Azam Khan is once again contesting from Rampur, but his victory does not seem to be difficult, as he has won seven times from this seat

 Within a week, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's meeting in western UP makes it clear that the BJP does not want to take any risk
 vah usee lahar ko ekbar phir hasil karne kii koshish kar rahi he jo 2014 main chali thi
 BJP is trying to maintain its leadership in these 8 seats Saharanpur, Kairana, Muzaffarnagar, Bijnor, Meerut, Baghpat, Ghaziabad, Gautam Budh Nagar to give a befitting reply to the alliance
 2014 ke chunaav prachaar or 2019 ke chunaav prachaar main ek antar yah bhi dekhne ko mil rahaa he ki pichhali baar bijepi kii reliyaan sabase aakhir main hoti thim
 But this time the SP-BSP alliance has held its rallies later
 congress chunaav ke 2-3 din pehle hawa banane kaa prayaas karti dikh rahi he
 On 28 March, when Modi targeted the SP-BSP and the Rashtriya Lok Dal at a rally in Meerut, this organization was described as Sarab (SP-RLD and BSP)

 yah prashasnic rup se saharanpur jile main aata he lekin loksabhaa kshetra kairana he jahaan se sapa kii tabassum hasan maidan main hai
 In this way, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will try to help Saharanpur and Kairana to the voters from the public meeting where there is a tough fight this time
 2014 ke pehle kairana main kabhi bijepi ko jeet nahin mili thi
 But in 2014, Hukum Singh changed history by winning from here

 After his death, BJP fielded his daughter Mriganka Singh, who lost to Rasht's Tabassum Hasan

 It will be known only on May 23 that SP-BSP will get a dent in vote percentage, but it is certain that BJP has a challenge to save its seats in these seats whereas SP-BSP and Congress would get victory in these seats
 If it is, it will be a plus point for them

 hamaari superstar nani ke alaava hamaari maa (munmun sen) to thim hi, hamaari daadi gayatri devi bhi thim or kooch bihar or jaipur rajgaraane kii sabhi pyaari striyaan bhi
 My father had decided that we should be brought up in a very normal way and that we would not be affected by any pressure or glare
 film kii shooting ke liye maa ko taiyaar hote hue dekhte-dekhte hi hamane bhi apane liye isi peshey kaa chunaav lagbhag kar hi liya tha
 We were caught in the glamor of this work of glamor
 varshon baad, jab maine filmi duniya main kadam rakhaa or unki filmein dekhne baithi to yah dekhakar hairaan rah gai ki ve apni har film main kitni garimapurna najar aati thim
 Their roles were so deeply engraved in the minds of the people that i would never try to do anything like them
 ek akelaa yahi tathy prerana kaa bahut bada strot he ki ek theth madhyamvargeey parivaar se hote hue bhi unhone itnaa kuch hasil kiya
 Among my maternal grandmother's films, i like Harano Sur (bangla, 1957), Saat Paake Bandha (bangla, 1963), Aandhi (hindi, 1975) and Dutta (bangla, 1976)
 ve har frem main laajawab lagati hai or apane abhinay ke prati darshakon kaa adhikadhik dhyaan aakarshith kar leti hai
 His bold but restrained acting in all these films has been a very important lesson of acting in my eyes
 film aandhi main abhinit aarti devi kaa kirdaar to mujhe sabase zyada pasand he; jis nafasat or garima ko unhone parade par jiya, uski misaal milanaa mushkil he
 He had not seen any of our films till last year
 kuch samay pehle unhen televijan par anuraanan (bangla, 2006) dekhne kaa mauka mila
 Later he told me that he liked me so much in the film that he saw that movie four times
 saath hi unhone yah bhi salaah di ki mujhe tony (anuraanan ke nirdeshak aniruddh raichoudhary) ke saath or kaam karnaa chahie
 When he expressed my desire to see more films, i showed him Rituparno Ghosh's Nauka Dubey (bangla, 2011)
 vah bhi unhen bahut pasand ai
 Actually my grandmother read the story of Nauka Dobi and Chokher Bali (bangla, 2003) to me
 chunki main ye kathanak sun chuki thi, is vajah se charitron ko acchhee tarah se samajhne main mujhe kaaphi madad mili
 When i was preparing for the role of Kadambari in a documentary on Tagore, directed by Rituparno Ghosh, he explained to me about the character and also how he is different from Nakam Doobi's Hemamalini
 haal hi main maine unhen ek shooting kii kuch tasviren dikhain to unhone mujhe bataaya ki kaise mujhe us frem main apane haath itani pramukhataa se nahin aane dene chahie the kyonki ve mere chehre se dhyaan hataa de rahe the
 Sometimes she also gives tips related to acting
 saath hi ve uttam kumaar ke saath kii apni filmon saare chuattar (bangla, 1953), sagarika (bangla, 1956), pathe holo deree (bangla, 1957), chhoa pouva (bangla, 1959) or saptapadi (bangla, 1961) se jude ateet ke tamaam kisse sunaaya karti hai
 She also describes how Uttam Kumar and he would always try to leave each other behind during the presentation of their dialogue
 magar yah sab majaak main hi hota tha
 Acting in those days required hard work and strong intentions and it was only after he succeeded that the career of showbusiness started to be respected
 unki filmon ke set par kisi ko bhi jane kii ijaajat nahin thi
 i think people were afraid of them
 kuch saal pehle kii baat he, unhone dada sahab phalke puraskaar lene se sirf is vajah se manaa kar diya kyonki ve us puraskaar ko lene ke liye baahar nahin nikalnaa chaahati thim
 We often tell them that they should go to Mumbai with us
 haalanki ve aane kaa vaada jarur karti hai magar ham jaanate hai ki aisa kabhi nahin hone vaala he
 Actually, he never liked Mumbai
 haalanki ve kabhi-kabhi apni hindi film aandhi ke apane saathi kalakaar sanjeev kumaar ke bare main baat karti hai or unhen mahanatam abhinaytaon main se ek maanati hai, magar ve mumbai ko kabhi apana nahin maan sakin
 He has always loved Kolkata very much
 ab chunki ve hamaare bagal main hi rahati hai isliye ham jab bhi kolkata main hote hai to khaanaa saath hi khate hai
 i also complain to her that whenever i go to her my weight increases because she feeds me a lot of food every time
 ve khaane ke bare main salaah nahin deteen magar yah jarur kahati hai ki mujhe niyamit rup se gym janaa chahie
 She does not meet anyone except her doctor and some relatives
 lekin yah maananaa padegaa ki ve bahut tej hai or hamaare aas-paas jo kuch bhi ghatit ho rahaa he, un sab baton kii khabar rakhti hai
 She reads fiercely and she particularly likes Bengali literature
 ve zyaadaatar samay puja-paath main bitaati hai
 Amma often says that i look like her a lot
 par jahaan tak meri baat he, to main to unki nanhee-si gudiya banakar hi khush hum

 ’ The victim of the Unnao gang-rape was stumbling rate for justice for a year
 soobe main har din teen encounter karne vaali yogi sarkaar kii upi police ke haath aaropee bijepi vidhayak kuldeep singh senger ke girebaan tak nahin pahunch paa rahe the
 On Thursday, the High Court rebuked the police, saying that there was no arrestable evidence against Sanger

 Arrested at 30
 siyaasi dalon kaa ghat-ghat kaa pani pine vaale senger bijepi ke liye palitha laga gaye hai
 The Yogi government is troubled by this matter
 iske baavjood bijepi netaa khamoshi akhriyaar kiye hue hai, kahin ye chuppi modi-yogi ke liye baari na pad jaae
 This is Unnao's case On April 4, 2017, a 17-year-old minor girl is kidnapped in Makhi village, 15 km from Unnao
 ladki gangrape kaa aarope makhi gaanv ke hi rahane vaale bijepi vidhayak kuldeep senger par lagaati he
 Being an MLA from the ruling party, the police in this case instead of taking action against the accused, puts the victim's father in jail
 peedita siem yogi ke awaas ke baahar aatmadah karne kii koshish karti he
 After this, the victim's father dies in police custody
 phir bhi yogi sarkaar neend se nahin jaagti
 The opposition Yogi government raises questions about the Unnao case and news comes in the media, then CM Yogi constitutes the SIT to investigate the case
 police dijipi press conference karke kehete hai ki vidhayak sirf aaropee hai
 By filing an answer on the intervention of the court, the UP police says that there is not enough evidence for arrest against BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar
 jabaki peedita khuleam vidhayak kaa naam lekar gangrape kaa aarope lagaati he
 BJP leader Maunbetti, who is campaigning for rescue, is silent on the Unnao case
 bijepi netaa is maamle par apni jubaan kholane ko taiyaar nahin hai
 Not only this, many BJP mlas are openly standing in favor of accused Kuldeep Singh Sengar
 wo peedita ke khilaaf hi bayaan de rahe hai
 There is one MLA Surendra Singh, who said that the mother of three children is raped somewhere
 amit shah kii khamoshiguruuvaar ko bijepi adhyaksh amit shah se jab is maamle par media ne sawaal kiya to bole ki road par baat nahin karenge

 It was believed that he would have an opinion on the matter

 The victim met Yogi, but did not get justice, the victim also met Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath for justice
 iske baavjood police ne aaropee vidhayak ke khilaaf koi karrwai nahin kii
 When the matter arose, MLA Sengar went to meet CM Yogi
 mulaakaat ke baad wo muskuraate hue nikle the
 On seeing the MLA, there was such a message that he seems to have got a clean chit from the CM
 isiilie unke chehre par muskaan bikhar rahi he
 The women leaders of the BJP are also silent today, questioning the then governments regarding the rape case during the khamoshaspa-bsp government
 itnaa hi nahin nasimuddin siddiki prakaran ko lekar bijepi ne kaha tha ki beti ke sammaan main bijepi maidan main
 Swati Singh, a minister in the Yogi government, is also silent on this matter

 When the media questioned Union Minister Smriti Irani on Thursday, she did not open her tongue

 The previous governments have suffered the brunt in such cases

 Governments had to face a lot of trouble due to lack of timely action on such cases

 The Yogi government is also seen to be walking on the same path
 jabaki yogi sarkaar se logon ko ummiden thi, lekin unnav maamle main unke ravaie se logon main naaraazgi bad rahi he
 Somewhere the BJP may not have to bear the brunt of this in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections

 Arun Maheshwari has distinguished himself as a vigilant commentator on economic issues and a Marxist critic
 4 june, 1951 ko janmen maheshwari ne apni shodhaparak vaicharik pustakon se kaaphi khyaati arjeet kii
 In student life, Arun was associated with CPI-M mouthpiece 'independence', associated with Marxist politics and literature movement
 unhone saahitiyik patrika ‘kalam’ kaa sampadan kiya to 'sahitya main yatharth: siddhant or vyavhaar', 'kala or sahitya ke saundaryashastreey maandand', 'pashchim bengal main maun kranti', 'pablo neruda: ek kaidi kii khuli duniya', 'ek or brahmad', 'harish bhaadaani', 'dharm, samskruti or raajnneeti', 'samaajwaad kii samasyaayein' or 'sirahaane gramshi' jaisi pustaken likhin
 He also translated some books
 rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ke bare main inaki kitaab 'aresas or uski vichaardhaara' ko ek paathya-pustak kii tarah sangh par sabase pramanik pustak kaha jaataa rahaa he
 Similarly, the authentic narrative of 34 years of communist government in West Bengal and its historical work in the field of land reforms is found in his book 'silent Revolution in West Bengal'
 'nai aarthik niti: kitni nai', san '91 ke baad se bhartiya arth-vyavastha ke nae aitihaasik mode par apane tarah kii akeli kitaab he
 His book 'sirhane Gramshi', written by centrist Marxist thinker Antonio Gramshi at the center of Gramshi, will hardly be found elsewhere in the manner in which the original installations of an intensive and multi-level thinker like Gramshi are presented
 chile ke vishwa-prasiddh nobel puraskaar vijeta kavi pablo neruda par 'pablo neruda : ek qaidi kii khuli duniya' ko da

 Arun Maheshwari had carved a niche for himself in the best Marxist tradition of debate-dialogue in Hindi from his first book, 'literature in reality: theory and practice'
 parvarti dinon main 'jansatta' hindi dainik main inke stambh 'chaturdik' tathaa aksar prakashit hone vaale raajnneetik lekhon ne hindi pathakon kaa dhyaan apni ore khinchaa he
 Today on the birthday of Arun Maheshwari, we are presenting a part of the book 'sirhana Gramshi' written by him and published by Rajkamal for the readers of Aaj Tak
 is pustak ke bare main lekhak ne likhaa tha- phasiston ke nar-meghi yatnaa or mrityu shiviron se lekar siberia ke nirvaasan shiviron or america jail-audyogic gathjod vaale kaidakhaanon tak kii kamobesh ek hi kahani he! naagarik swatantraaa kii pramukh america kaaryakarta angila davis kii shabdaawalee main- aaj bhi jari das pratha kii kahani! sudhargrih kahe jane vaale bhartiya jail inase shaayad hi alag hai!italy main phasiston ke jail main bees saal ke liye sajayaftaa marxvaadi vichaarak or communist netaa antonio gramshi ne sajaa ke das saal bhi puure nahin kiye ki unke sharir ne jawaab de diya! mrityu ke ek maheenaa pehle unhen reeha kiya gaya tha! lekin jail main bitaye in chaand saalon ke aropit ekant kaa unhone italy ke itihaas, uski samskruti, marxvaadi darshan tathaa communist party ke bare main gahare vivechan ke liye jaisaa istemaal kiya usne unki jail diary ko duniya ke shreshthatam jail-lekhan ke samakaksh rakh diya! khaas taur par communist partiyon main shaamil logon ke liye to isane jaise soch-vichaar ke ek puure naye kshetra ko khol diya !gramshi kaa yah puraa lekhan communiston ko, kisi bhi marxvaadi ke liye apekshit, tamaam vaicharik jadtaaon se maansik taur par unmukt karne kaa ek chunauti bharaa lekhan he! ek aise vichaarak ke saath jail main bitaye chand dinon kii yah diary kisi bhi pathak ke liye, khaas taur par raajnneetik-saamaajik kaaryakartaaon ke liye bahut upyogi anubhav sabit ho sakati he! isaki paardarshee bhashaa, antasthit sookshm vednaa or svachhand vichaar-pravaah ne is pustak ko apane prakaar kii ek anuthi kriti kaa rup diya he !pustak anshah sirahaane gramshi;ek communist kii jivan-lila- arun maheshwarigramshi ek raajnneetik siddhantkaar hai
 He has illuminated in a surprising analytical manner on the various subjects of literature and culture
 lekin yah sab mulat: italy kii communist party or us desh main samaajawaadee kranti kii jaruraton ke tahat hi kiya gaya he
 What is the class structure of Italy's society, what is its cultural history, what is the mental texture of the people, what is the nature and path of development of the economy - all these have become the subject of their thoughts under the political needs of the Communist Party
 lekin raajnneeti kii apni kuch vidmbanaayen hai
 Regardless of how important and far-reaching the purpose of social change she is, to a large extent, contemporaryism is both her departure and destination
 isiilie raajnneetik chintan main darshanashastreey tattvik chintaaon kii tarah kii chirantarataa or sanatanta nahin hoti
 It is always a relative truth, no pole, no absolute truth
 yahi vajah he ki raajnneetik netaa or siddhantkaar bhi aksar apane vichaaron or vishleshanon main kaaphi teji se pher-badal karte hue dekhe ja sakate hai
 i am not talking about defective, opportunistic politicians here
 unke liye to bhoot, vartmaan, bhavishya kisi ke bhi pariprekshya main sivaay apane nijee swaarth ke desh, kaal, samaaj kuch nahin hota
 i am talking of serious politicians who consider intervening in the present to give a shape to the future amidst all the ambushes of their time
 gramshi aise pehali pankti ke ahm marxvaadi raajnneetivettaon main ek pramukh sthaan rakhte hai
 He was a proven thinker of Marxist philosophy, an expert in the science of socialist revolution and an acute knowledgeer of world conditions
 1891 main janme gramshi kii mrityu 27 april, 1937 ko hui thi
 He spent about 10 years in Mussolini's prison before his death
 1926 main ve anya kai communist netaaon ke saath giraftaar kiye gaye the or 1928 ke june maheene main unhen 20 saal 8 maheene kii sajaa sunai gai
 He became very ill while in prison and was released from prison in early 1937 in the acute state of illness
 isi saal 25 april ko unke dimag kii nas fat gai or 27 april, 1937 ko unki mrityu ho gai
 Gramshi came into contact with Italian socialists at the age of 17-18 and started studying the works of Karl Marx
 1913 se ve italy ke communiston ke sampark main aa gaye
 In 1915, at the age of just 24, he left the graduate studies in the middle of the socialist newspaper 'avanti!' And started working in other newspapers of the same view
 iske saath hi alag se unhone bhashashastra par bhi apni thisis ke liye adhyayan jari rakhaa
 Thus, Gramshi was not only familiar with all the ideological debates of the world communist movement of that time, but also continuously participated in these debates through writing
 communist international se gahare sambandhon ke saath ve italy kii communist party ke ek pramukh netaa ban gaye the
 After the Socialist Revolution of Russia in 1917, socialism had come on the political agenda of the whole of Europe and with it the most ferocious and barbaric forms of capitalism in Western Europe, especially Germany, Italy and Spain - Nazism and Fascism - emerged
 
 usase puure europe kaa raajnneetik drishyapat kaaphi ulajhanon bharaa or taral sthiti main tha
 The socialist revolution did not progress beyond Russia
 janm ke saath hi samaajawaadee soviet sangh ko samrajyavaadiyon kii nakebandi kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 Nazism and Fascism had adopted a strategy to defeat the communists on the basis of their organizational methods
 thothe, lok-lubhaavan naaron kii unke paas kami nahin thi
 Together they exercised the power of the modern state to crush the parliamentary democracy publicly and adopt the path of barbaric suppression of opponents
 rus tak simit rah gai samaajawaadee kranti kaa jahaaj, vahaan se or kahin ja hi nahin sakaa
 That is why the state of the world communist movement till 1917 and a few years later was one and with the aim of decimating the rise of Mussolini and then Hitler and Franco in 1922, their forced authority over the states and all the parties and individuals of the democratic opposition, including the communists
 The situation at the time of the brutal repression cycle was second
 kahan to communist kranti ke vijay-rath ke sarvatra daud jane kii kalpana kii ja rahi thi, or kahan europe ke puure communist aandolan ke saamne astitv kaa hi khatra paidaa ho gaya
 Under these circumstances, Stalin called for the lifting of the flag of democracy thrown by the bourgeoisie by the communists
 finland ke dimitrov ne fasiwad-najeevaad virdohi sabhi takaton ke sanyukt morche ke nirmaan ko communiston kaa sabase pratham or mahatvapurn kartavya bataaya tha
 That is to say, at the time when Gramsci was active as an important leader of the Communist Party of Italy and a Marxist thinker and theorist, the political situation in the whole of Europe, including Italy, was in great turmoil
 rus kii communist party ke andar bhi tab kai mahatvapurn vishyon par teevr vichaardhaaratmak sangharsh kii ghatnaayen ghat chuki thim
 Lenin had intense debate with leaders such as Plakhanov, Trotsky on issues such as 'socialism in a country' and 'new Economic Policy' (hrushvak)
 tratski 'vishwa samaajawaadee kranti' or 'sanathan kranti' kii tarah ke vichaaron par ade hue the
 Within the Communist International there were also huge differences of opinion regarding the imperialist war
 stallin or tratski kaa virodh ek or hi prakaar kii khuli shatruta kii disha main mud chukaa tha
 Trotsky had to flee and take refuge in another country
 communist party or soviet rajya ke bich sambandhon kaa swaroop kya ho, rajya ke adhikaron or nagarikon ke adhikaron ke bich samaajwaad ke antargat kaise sahi santulan banaae rakhaa jaae, poonjeewaad kii patanshiltaa or uske avashyambhavi paraabhav ke bare main communist international ke aakalnon or lagaataar ghoshnaaon ke baavjood viksit poonjeewaadi deshon main communist aandolan ke naganya prabhaav or poonjeewaad ke nirantar shaktishaalee hote jane kaa rahasy kya he- ye saare prashn gramshi ke rahete hi vishwa communist aandolan ke saamne ubharkar aa gaye the
 Today, 90 years later, after the end of the Soviet Union and the socialist camp, all these questions are badly choking the communist movement of the whole world
 isi prakaar communist party kaa santhnik swaroop kaisaa ho, kya ek naukarshahi dhang ke cmand system ke aadhaar par chalane vaala communist party kaa dhaanchaa us aitihaasik daayitv ko puraa kar saktaa he jo use puri maanav sabhyataa ko ek nayaa, puri tarah samtapurna, nyaaypurna or manvochit swaroop dene kii jimmedaari pradaan karata he?gaur karne laayak baat yah he ki gramshi ne in saare sawaalon par khaastaur par apane jail jivan ke vakt bahut hi gambheertha se vichaar kiya tha
 He accepted him as a Marxist thinker with the right spirit, rather than clinging to any such painful question
 ve unase takaraae or us takaraahat main apane andar kii bhi aisi bahut si baddhamul avadharanaon ko todaa jo sachai se dur thi or isi ke bich se samaajawaadee kranti ke nae raste kaa sandhaan karne kii koshish kii
 The questions which remain a formidable question for the communist movement even today, the grammar with a profound insight of Gramshi is so innovative and evocative that even after 75 years of his death, he remains the subject of attraction for all Marxist thinkers and politicians Huh
 uparokt vivaran se jaahir he ki gramshi ne apane jeevankaal main communist aandolan ke utthan or patan ke anek roopon ko dekha tha, paristhitiyon main teji se hue parivartanon ko pahachaanaa tha or unka vishleshan karte hue krantikari kaaryon kii nai saiddhantiki ke nirmaan kii peshkash kii thi
 That is why naturally one can find many types of discrepancies and contradictions in his writings
 yahi to chaalu raajnneetik ghatnakramon ke vishleshanon ke kisi bhi sankalan kii vidmbana he
 This is the reason why initially we have tried to make them acquainted by calling them a political theorists, it is about these minor anomalies and contradictions
 inhen kii padtaal par ham gramshi kaa apana critic taiyaar karnaa chaahate hai
 From this, all those things will come to the fore, due to which Gramshi's sting is still in the entire Marxist, Communist light
 erik habsavam ne is sankalan kii bhoomika main bahut sahi likhaa he ki ''sahi kahen to mukhyat: ek communist chintak ke rup main gramshi ne italy se baahar logon kaa dhyaan isliye aakarshith kiya ki usne un deshon ke liye marxvaadi ranneeti pradaan kii jinamein ab tak kranti ek prerana ho sakati thi, lekin model nahin
 That is, the strategy of socialist movement in non-revolutionary environment and circumstances
 ''gale main dard he
 Looks like some treatment will have to be done
 yahan ghar kii tarah bhaap vagairah lene kii vyavastha nahin he

 com / lcz2ynknf1 Actually, a video of 'dance Deewane Season 2' is going viral on social media
 is video main maadhuri dikshit (madhuri Dixit), tushaar kaaliya, shashaank khetaan sho ke ankar arjuna bijlani (arjun Bijlani) ke saath salmaan khan kii film 'bharat' (bharat) ke gane slo moshan (slow Motion) par muves karte dikhaai de rahe hai
 Fans are very fond of this style
 viral ho raheis video ko colors tivi ke twitor handle se share kiya gaya he
 While sharing this video, in the caption, giving Salman Khan a 'dance Deewane' challenge, wrote, 'we have taken your Slow Motion Challenge, will you also take our Dance Deewane Challenge?' However, now it has to be seen whether Salman Khan will take this challenge or not? holi kaa tyohaar kareeb he
 People have started preparing
 rangon ke is tyohaar ke din har koi khaas dikhnaa chahta he
 Therefore, the right choice of clothes is very important
 aaiye jaanate hai ki kis tarah kaa pahanava is holi aapke liye behatar sabit ho saktaa he
 1-you can also start with simple look
 trougers leging or genes ke saath simple kurta pahan kar aap sada or man ko bhaane vaala luk paa sakate hai
 2- If you want a traditional look then you can wear a jacket with a jumpsuit
 ise alaava ghutanon tak kii printate skirt ke saath tii-shart kaa mail bhi aapako ek alag luk de saktaa he
 If you are avoiding dark colors then you have a better option that you can also take a color scarf or stall that matches with light colored clothes
 cheharaa dhote vakt ham karte hai ye 5 galtiyaan!3-holi khelte samay aap pani ke sampark main rahete hai
 During this time it is important that you also pay attention to your footwear
 in maukon par hells pahananaa khatarnaak sabit ho saktaa he
 Therefore, it is important that you wear such slippers while playing the color that there is no fear of slipping or of getting stuck
 4-is dauraan aapako apane baalo kaa bhi dhyaan rakhana chahie
 It is important that you keep your hair tied well
 aap apane baalo kaa juda baandh sakati hai yaa ponytel bana sakati hai taaki aap bephikr hokar holi kaa anand le saken
 Without these 5 things, your Holi will be incomplete while playing Holi
 natural luk ke saath holi khelnaa zyada phaayde kaa sauda hoga
 You can use eyeliner and mascara for eyes
 iske alaava hothon ko rukhepan se bachaane ke liye lipbaam kaa prayog bhi kar sakati hai
 Twisted shirt and rolled sleeves
 43 varshiya sires mistre mumbai kii homi modi street par sthit tata ke mukhyalay bombai house ke suut-bootadhari or aupchaarik poshaak waalon ke bilkul ulat jaan padate hai
 It is also a kind of cultural shock in the board room of Tata Sons on the fourth floor
 yah ratan naval tata kaa vyapak najariya tha ki tata company main prabandhan ke str par kam umr ke logon ko aage badhaayaa jaae
 Mistry is part of the same dream
 ratan tata ne bade hi vyavasthit dhang se is agenda par kaam karnaa shuru kiya
 It debuted in 2009, when 46-year-old Ann
 chandrashekharan ko khaastaur par vishalkay company tata kansaltency ke siio ke bataur chunaa gaya; phir 42 varshiya aar
 Mukundan took over the reins of Tata Chemicals in 2008; The same year, Mukund Rajan, formerly an executive assistant to Ratan Tata, was appointed the head of Tata Teleservices (maharashtra)
 tab unki umr mahaj 40 varsh thi
 Then N
, the second executive assistant to the chairman
 shrinath ko 2007 main tata communications main sabase ooncha pad mila, jab ve sirf 45 varsh ke the or teen saal pehle brotin banerjee sirf 35 varsh kii aayu main tata houseing ke siio bane
 These elections are a clear indication that this group is currently undergoing a transition
 bade-bujurgavaron ne nae leaderon ke liye jagah khaali kar di he, jo samooh ke nae chehre ke rup main ubhar rahe hai
 Jamshed J
, 75, retired from the board of seven-member Tata Sons in June
 irani is naatakeey badlaav kii antarvastu par roshni daalate hai: ''sires behad santulit, nape-tule or gambhir vyakti hai
 All of us on the board of Tata Sons praised his thinking and thoughts and we all could see that a relationship was developing between Ratan Tata and him
 ''tata samooh ke andruni sutara bataate hai ki ratan tata kai baar board kii baithkon ke dauraan mahatvapurn aarthik maamalon main mistre kii salaah liya karte the
 It was clear that the youngest person on the board was being prepared for future big responsibilities
 2006 main 82 varsh kii aayu main pelanji shaporji mistre tata sans ke board se sevanivrutt hue tab aisa mana ja rahaa tha ki ve apane bade bete 47 varshiya shapore ko apana daayitv saunpane ke icchhuk honge
 But Ratan Tata's emphasis was on another person
 kedaar capital ke sansthaapak saajhedaar manish kejariwal ke mutabik mistre ''chup rahane or kam bolne vaale budghijeevi kism ke vyakti hai, jo har cheez ko gaharaari or vistaar ke saath dekhne main yakeen karte hai
 His vision is very balanced
 ve jaraa bhi bhavuk nahin hote or bijness ke liye bilkul anukool vyakti hai
 Industrialist Adi Godrej says that Mistry is the perfect choice for a "company undergoing transition"
 ve kehete hai, ''sires ne halchal paidaa kar di he
 After all, the business of this company is spread on such a large scale all over the world
 ''puri duniya main kaam kar rahe company ke bahut se oonche padon par baithe manager is nirnay ko ummid se dekh rahe hai kyonki tata samooh ke kul rajasav kaa 66 fisadi ab antarrashtriya vyapaar se judaa hua he
 Irani sees a lot of similarities with Ratan Tata becoming chairman in 1991 and now Mistry
 ''tata ne jab daayitv sambhala tab company kaa vaishvik rajasav sirf 10 fisadi tha
 Today, due to his vision, new and big ideas, well thought out strategies have increased amazingly
 ve hamase hameshaa kehete rahe hai-bada socho, saahsee nirnay lo or munaafe kii yojanaayen banaao
 See where the group stands today

 In the Delhi countryside, the politics of hookah drinking and drinking is hot, but these days the politics of hookah is very hot
 dilli main chalane vaale hukka baar par pabandi ko lekar aam aadmi party or bijepi ke bich sehara baandhne kii siyasat chal padi he
 It has happened that after a Central Government notification in Delhi, the Delhi Government issued orders to close the hookah bar running in all restaurants and cafes
 is bare main jab mangalvaar ko dilli ke swasthya mantri ne bayaan jari kiya, to bijepi emele manjinder singh sirsa or saansad pravesh verma palatwaar karne maidan main aa gaye
 According to Pravesh Verma, in May 2017, the Central Government issued a notification banning the hookah bar
 notificesh main kendriya swasthya mantralay ne niyam bana diya ki kisi bhi restaurant ke smoking aria main restaurant kii taraf se smoking kii koi chiz nahin parosi ja sakegi
 Not only this, no food and drink will be served in the smoking area
 agar graahak chaahe to wo apane saath laae smoking ke saamaan kaa istemaal restaurant ke smoking aria main kar saktaa he or smoking ke baad agar usko kuch khaanaa pinaa he to restaurant ke andar use parosa ja sakegaa
 But according to Verma, the Delhi government sat on this order for five months
 bijepi emele sirsa ne daawa kiya ki unhone centre sarkaar ke notification ke baad engiti main cese daayar kiya or dilli main chal rahe avaidh hukka baron par pabandi kii apil kii
 The NGT also summoned the Delhi government
 tab kahin jaakar sarkaar kii neend khuli or ab sirf bayaan jari kar satyendra jain avaidh hukqabaron par pabandi kii baat kar rahe hai, jabaki ection ke naam par kuch nahin kiya
 Sirsa alleged that the Delhi government is not serious about this drug trade and is not deliberately taking action on hookah bars
 ab hukka baar par pabandi ke liye centre se paanch maheene pehle notification ho gaya
 The Delhi government has also declared a ban, but the hookah bars are still running unabashedly and only politics is being done in the name of ban on hookah bars

 Apart from this, Dev is not averse to cry publicly

 raksha mantri manohar parrikar ne kaha he ki kashmir main sena ko aatankwaadiyon ke unke upar goli chalaane kaa intjaar karne or ‘‘shahid hone’’ ke bajaay un bandookdhaariyon par goli chalaane kaa puraa adhikaar he
 Addressing a BJP rally in Vasco, Goa last night, Parrikar said, "when i took over as the defense minister, the first thing i said to him (to the soldiers) was that if you were in the hands of any person If you see a machine gun or a pistol, do not expect him to come to you
 isse pehle ki aap shahid hon, aapako use khatm kar dena chahie
 '' parrikar ne daawa kiya ki pradhanmantri narendra modi nit sarkaar ke centre main satta main aane ke baad se sena kaa manobal badha he
 He said, "our army is fighting terrorists in Kashmir
" congress sarkaar ne unhen yah nirdesh diya tha ki jab tak saamne vaale kii (aatankwaadiyon kii) ore se un par goli nahin chalaai jaae tab tak ve javaabi karrwai nahin karen
 "in the backdrop of tremendous ceasefire violations by Pakistan, Parrikar said that Indian soldiers have this right and they are giving a befitting reply to the enemy
" parrikar ne kaha, ‘‘hamaare sainikon ko ab un par goli chalaane vaale vyakti par javaabi karrwai ke liye raksha mantralay se ijaajat lene kii jarurat nahin he
 They have every right to this and are also giving a befitting reply to our enemy
 mujhe bahut dukh he ki hamaare kuch sainik shahid ho gaye hai
 '' Comments parrikar ne bataaya ki mantralay kii karypranali ko samajhane main unhen lagbhag chah se aath maheene kaa samay laga
 The former chief minister said, "initially i could not understand how the Ministry of Defense functions
 ise samajhane main mujhe chah se aath maheene kaa samay laga

 If the words Masjid and Ayodhya are removed from the history of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), there is not much left to prove the effort on its part
 in do shabdon ke alaava ek vyakti bhi he jo vishwa hindu parishad ko uske hone kii sarthakata pradaan karata he
 The name of that person is Mulayam Singh Yadav
 15 aktubar ko vihip ke antarrashtriya sangrakshak ashok singhl dilli main inhen donon shabdon tathaa usee tisare vyakti kaa naam le rahe the lekin maahaul main koi khaas uttejnaa paidaa na hui
 Ashok Singhal said that Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav is trying to build a mosque in Ayodhya under pressure from Muslims
 iske liye baqayada 200 acre jameen ko chinhit kar liya gaya he or ek ritred jaj mahoday pichley do saal se is kaam ko anjaam dene kii koshish kar rahe hai
 This is Ashok Singhal of Ashok Singhal 2012
 jaraa sochie, yahi singhl agar 1992 ke singhl hote or mulaayam singh par aarope lagaate ki ve ayodhya main chupake se masjid or muslim samskruti centre banavaane kii koshish kar rahe hai, to kya khabar banati? 1992 ke or aaj ke singhl main do dashak kaa faasla he
 And why only see this gap in Ashok Singhal? In this period, Mulayam Singh, Masjid and Ayodhya have all come two decades apart
 vakt do dashak aage bad chukaa he
 So when Ashok Singhal calls a press conference to make such a serious allegation against Mulayam Singh, there is no break of journalists
 jo aate hai ve bhi sawaal kam hi uthaate hai
 Some of the journalists sitting behind showed more interest in playing the singles on Singhal rather than asking questions in the middle of the press conference
 agar yahi singhl nauven dashak vaale singhl hote to is khulaase ke baad na jane kya hota
 At least in the world of news, there is chaos
 lekin aaj unke is mahatvapurn khulaase par agle din ek kollam kii khabar bhi shaayad hi kahin chhapi
 Even after two decades of the Ram Mandir movement, he always remembers that the VHP represents the saint society of the country and the disrespect of the saint society will not be tolerated
 lekin ab janata ko yah purana jumala yaad nahin he
 In this long change of two decades, 'kal Chora Arvind Kejriwal' becomes more important than Singhal who is protesting against a Union Minister who comes from Muslim society, just a short distance from there
 agar vihip ke media centre main ek tivi channlavaale ke intjaar main singhl ko bolne se thodi der rokkar rakhaa jaataa he to thik bagal main sansad maarg par kejariwal ke dharne par darjanabhar ovi vine live prasaaran ke liye dati raheen
 The time has really changed for Ashok Singhal and VHP
 do dashak kaa yahi vah antar he jise shaayad ab tak vihip samaj nahin pai he
 The Ram temple movement from which BJP was born as a political alternative, that BJP too has never satisfied Ashok Singhal, it is not so
 chah saal ke endie shasankaal ke dauraan mandir yojana par kabhi koi kaam nahin hua
 Paramahamsa Ramachandras traveled from the world with his last wish, but Atal Bihari Vajpayee's government allowed his wish to be left behind
 endie ke is chah saal ke shasankaal ke dauraan aresas bhi yah maan baitha tha ki ram mandir se zyada jaruri centre kii sarkaar he, isliye singhl par kamobesh puure chah saal aresas kaa dabaav bana rahaa ki ve kabhi kuch aisa apriy nahin karenge jisase centre kii gaiyr-congressi sarkaar paanch saal kaa kaarykaal puraa karne se maharoom ho jaae
 Apart from this, the effect of age and heart disease has also served to calm the excitement of Singhal
 bhale hi aaj bhi unki aawaaj main umr or beemaari kaa koi lakshan na dikhaai detaa ho lekin sambhawatah ve yah baat samaj gaye hai ki ab unka bolnaa ek na chapanevaale bayaan se zyada kuch nahin he
 For VHP, there is no personality bigger than Singhal but the work of the council is now in the hands of others
 iske saath hi bijepi se vah talmail nahin rahaa ki vihip ke kehane par bijepi kisi mudde par aage bad jaae
 Perhaps this is the reason that when a journalist asked him if there was any talk with the BJP in this regard, Singhal said very strongly that "the talk keeps happening
" aap (patrakaron ko) bhi to vahaan (bijepi daftar) jate rahete hai
 You also talk
 ” yani singhl bhi samajhate hai ki bees saal ke samay pravaah main vah bhartiya janata party bahakar unase kitni dur ja chuki he ki ekbargi milane kii koi sambhaavna nahin bachi he
 Perhaps this is the reason why even after touching the magical triangle of Ayodhya, Masjid and Mulayam Singh Yadav, journalists did not show any special interest in listening to Singhal
 is jaadui trikon ne kabhi vihip ko hinduon kaa pratinidhi sanghathan bana diya tha
 The same magical triangle is visible once again after twenty years, but the VHP itself does not have the potential to make an issue and redeem it
 hinduon ke pratinidhi sanghathan hone kaa uskaa daawa feekaa padataa najar aa rahaa he
 Ashok Singhal still insists today that if a mosque is built in Ayodhya, the whole country will be disturbed, but this disturbing warning of his disturbance is unable to make anyone restless
 vidambnaa hi he ki agar singhl ke daavon main koi sachai he bhi to bhi unhen sunne vaala koi nahin bachaa he

 kendriya mantri nirmala sitaraman or arun jetali ne buudhvaar ko rafel ladaaku vimaan saude ke sambandh main purv kendriya mantri yashavanth sinha tathaa arun shouri ke aaropon ko khaarij kiya or kaha ki sarkaar is sambandh main sansad main pehle hi jawaab de chuki he
 Former Union Ministers Yashwant Sinha and Arun Shourie said the Kirafel deal is a case of 'criminal misconduct to be kept' and is much bigger than the Bofors scam
 unhone maang kii ki saude kii jaanch ek nirdhaarit samay main kaig dwaara karai jaani chahie
 Defense Minister Nirmala Sitharaman dismissed the allegations as 'baseless'
 mantri ne twit kiya ki sarkaar sansad main pehle hi aaropon par jawaab de chuki he
 a recent attempt to tarnish the government's image through unfounded accusations went awry in Parliament
 1
 All claims being leveled in various press conferences are already answered on the floor of the Parliament
 a recent attempt, in the House,to malign the government through baseless charges collapsed
 Today's was yet another attempt at repeating fabricated facts
 # Rafale— Nirmala Sitharaman (@nsitharaman)august 8, 2018vahiin kendriya mantri arun jetali ne rafel ladaaku vimaan saude main gadabadi kii shikayaton ko 'apramanik' or 'jhooth ko phir se jhaad-foonkkar pesh kiya janaa' qaraar diya tathaa kaha ki ye aarope un takaton dwaara lagaae ja rahe hai jo apni praasangikta sabit karne main lagaataar hataash ho rahi hai
 Jaitley wrote on Facebook under the title 'the Rafale Falsehood Repeated', 'there is no truth in the repeated baseless allegations nor is there anything to corroborate the alleged facts and heavy documents raised in support of the baseless allegations
 'sinha or shouri ne adhivaktaa-kaaryakarta prashanth bhushan ke saath ek samvaadadaata sammelan ko sambodhit karte hue france se 36 rafel ladaaku vimaan kharidne se jude 58,000 karod rupee ke saude ke sambandh main kai sawaal uthaae
 The three men, known as bitter critics of the NDA government, accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of single-handedly changing the standards associated with the deal and said that the procedures required to finalize the deal were severely violated
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki samoochaa sauda 'aapraadhik kadachaar, saarvajanik pad ke durupyog or rashtriya hit tathaa rashtriya suraksha kii keemat par pakshon ko sampann banane kaa anoothaa maamla he
 The trio said the government tried to 'hide' the facts
 congress rafel saude main baari aniyamittaaon ke aarope lagaati rahi he
 It says that the government is paying Rs 1,670 crore for a Rafale aircraft, while the UPA government had signed a Rafale deal for the purchase of 126 Rafale aircraft for Rs 526 crore
 sinha, shouri or bhushan ne sarkaar ke is tark ko bhi khaarij kiya ki vimaanon kii keemat unamem vishistataaon tathaa vishisht hathiyaar pranaaliyon kii vajah se bad gai
 Describing the Rafale deal as the 'biggest defense scam' of the country till date, Bhushan alleged that it caused a loss of at least Rs 35 thousand crore to the state exchequer
 jetali ne kaha, 'sarkaar ke khilaaf apusht aarope kuch nahin, balki un shaktiyon dwaara jhooth ko phir se jhaad-foonkkar pesh kiya janaa he jo apni praasangikta sabit karne main lagaataar hataash hoti ja rahi hai
 The government had already responded effectively to the things and misinformation presented by distorting this issue
 'unhone kaha ki ye aarope rafel ladaaku vimaan kii kharid ke liye 2016 main do sarkaron ke bich hue samjhaute ke bare main jhooth or managasaint tathy failaakar sarkaar ko badnaam karne kii bas ek or koshish hai
 He said that it is even more condemnable that a new attempt to tarnish the image of the government has been made in the Parliament almost two weeks after the face of such an attempt
