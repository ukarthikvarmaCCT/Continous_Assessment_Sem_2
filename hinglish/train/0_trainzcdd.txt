 We are connecting them with a corridor so that there is no conviction, there is a place to live
 ye to jangal ke raja hai, apane hisaab se rahete hai, aane vaale vakt main aap dekhenge
 'another reason is that tiger corridors and forests are spread over large areas in other states, but forests in Madhya Pradesh are not spread over large areas
 isliye shikari aasaani se ghaat laga lete hai
 Under the agreement to form a Special Tiger Protection Force, in two years, they were to make weapons and deploy them, but nothing has passed after seven years

 jameen par bijepi or vipaksh kii bhidnt dekhne ko mil rahi he
 For some time, all opposition parties, including the Congress, have been accusing the BJP of including the cinema and the small screen in the political agenda
 unhen apni party ke pramotion kaa madhyam bana diya he
 The current central government schemes are being mentioned in the serials
 congress is baat se naaraaz he
 a complaint has been made by the Congress about this in the Election Commission
 chunaav ke dauraan congress ne ise aachaar samhita kaa ulanghan bataaya he
 The Congress has demanded from the Election Commission that the broadcasts of the serials in which this is being done should be stopped
 apni shikaayat main congress ne kaha, "aise serials kaa istemaal modi kii image banane ke liye kiya ja rahaa he
 This is a violation of code of conduct by the BJP
 ''bataa den ki tujhse he rabta, bhaabiji ghar par hai or kumkum bhagya jaise serial par modi kii tamaam skims ke prachaar kaa aarope laga he
 Yesterday i realized Modi has found another venue to advertise himself
 i watch "bhabhi ji ghar par hain" (that's right, deal with it), this TV serial has started to use some not so subtle Product placement / advertisement recently, but yesterday something else happened

 Huh
 ve kehete hai ki- ''tum logon ne puure kanpur shahar kaa haal kharaab kar rakhaa he
 You know that when the issue of cleanliness campaign was started a few years ago, this campaign was stalled due to not being aware only
 lekin aaj ek karmath netaa kii vajah se yah abhiyaan phir ye active ho gaya he
 "there are more such dialogues included
" iske alaava baaki serials kaa bhi yahi haal he
 Now the thing to see is what the Election Commission decides on this
 paanch rajyon ke chunaavon ke parinaam aane ke baad bijepi khushi se phuli nahin samaa rahi he
 The reason for this is that states like Kerala and Assam were left out of the hands of the Congress, which would fulfill the dream of PM Narendra Modi's Congress Liberation
 in paanch rajyon main se bijepi sirf assam main jeet darj kara pai he, lekin pashchim bengal, kerala, tamilnadu main bijepi ne apni upasthiti darj karne ke saath-saath apane vot pratishat main acchhee khaasi badhotaree bhi kii he
 In many states, the bjp's government has an absolute majority government in Gujarat, Rajasthan, Haryana, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Assam, Goa and coalition governments in Maharashtra, Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab and Andhra Pradesh
 haalanki jammu-kashmir, punjab or andhrapradesh main duusare dalon ke mukhyamantri hai
 On the other hand, the Congress has government in Karnataka, Manipur, Meghalaya, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Nagaland
 jisame se sirf karnataka hi bada rajya he baaki sab chote rajya hai
 After the election results, the vote percentage of the Congress across the country decreased to 6
 5 pratishat rah gaya he
 And on the other hand bjp's vote percentage increased to 36
 5 pratishat ho gaya he
 Not much hope for next year's assembly elections PM Modi's dream of Congress-free India seems to be fulfilled many times because Congress does not have much hope from assembly elections in other states till 2019
 2017 main upi, punjab, uttarakhand, himachal pradesh, gujarat main vidhansabha ke chunaav hone hai
 There is little hope of Congress winning in UP
 punjab main badal sarkaar ke khilaaf maahaul to he, lekin vahaan par arvind kejariwal kii aam aadmi party ne congress se zyada majbootee se akali dal ko takkar de rakhi he
 What is the status of the Congress in Uttarakhand is not hidden from anyone and the election will be on the shoulder of Harish Rawat when many rebels of Congress have joined BJP
 or gujarat main bijepi kii tod ke liye koi bada cheharaa nahin he
 Elections in four states are to be held in 2018
 sabase pehle karnataka main chunaav honge yahaan par bijepi siddharmaiya ke saamne apane sabase bade chehre yediurppa ko utaarne vaali he
 The BJP will benefit from being in the fight against JDS
 saal ke ant main madhyapradesh, chhattisgarh or rajasthan main bhi chunaav hone hai
 In the face of Shivraj Singh Chauhan's popularity in Madhya Pradesh, no Congress leader can see such a distance
 chhattisgarh main congress aapasi ladaai main hi uljhi hui he aise main chunaav jitna dur kii kodi he
 The Congress has some hope from Rajasthan, but it is not easy for the Congress to defeat Vasundhara Raje
 modi ke netritv main bijepi badhati aagaab lagata he kii 1980 ke dashak main congress jis tarah se loksabhaa main bhi purna bahumat kii sarkaar thi or desh ke aadhe se zyada rajyon main congress kii sarkarein thi
 Today, under the leadership of PM Modi, BJP has reached that position

 Apart from this, students also have problems with the new curriculum

 BJP is aiming to win more than 220 seats this time in Maharashtra
 ise hasil karne ke liye mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis pradesh main rathyatra nikaalane ja rahe hai
 However, not only the opposition but bjp's ally Shiv Sena is also raising questions on this rath yatra
 vasundhara raaje, shivaraj singh chouhan or raman singh kii tarj par mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis apane paanch saal ke vikaas kaaryon ko ghar-ghar pahunchane ke liye agast main rathyatra shuru karne vaale hai
 The BJP has given the slogan of 'once again Shivshahi Sarkar' and 'this time across 220'
 is yatra ke jariye fadanvis pradesh kii sabhi 288 vidhansabha kshetron kaa daura karenge
 Raising the Rath Yatra, NCP spokesman Nawab Malik questioned that Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis should be ashamed to take out the Yatra
 pradesh main 15 hajaar kisaanon ke shav yatra kaa jawaab koun degaa? kisaanon ke paas jane ke liye mukhyamantri ke paas vakt nahin he or vah rathyatra nikaal rahe hai
 All games are being done to distract from the real issues of the state
 vipaksh hi nahin balki bijepi kii sahyogi shivasena bhi rathyatra ko lekar tanj ksaa he
 Taking a dig at Saamna's editorial, the Shiv Sena said that the proposed 'rath Yatra' of Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis should pass through the homes of farmers who had committed suicide
 rajya sarkaar ne pichley saptaah sweekaar kiya ki chaar saal main 12,000 se adhik kisaanon ne aatmahatya kii he
 In such a situation, to understand the grievances and sufferings of the families of the farmers, the proposed 'rath Yatra' should pass through the houses of these 12000 farmers
 maharashtra ke itihaas main pehali baar he ki jab koi netaa mukhyamantri rahete hue rathyatra ke jariye pradesh bhar kaa daura karenge
 Through this visit, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis wants to understand the political mood of the state as well as make his development work accessible among the people
 yah yatra agast main shuru hogi or vidhansabha chunaav tak jari rahegi
 Before Fadnavis, Vasundhara Raje had taken out a rath yatra in Rajasthan, Shivraj Singh Chauhan in Madhya Pradesh and Raman Singh in Chhattisgarh, but the three leaders could not save their government
 haalanki bijepi kii jin rajyon main sarkaar hoti he, vahaan par chunaav se pehle mukhyamantri aisi yatra nikaalte rahenge
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also been taking such a journey while being the CM of Gujarat, due to which the BJP started taking such trips in other states too
 maharashtra main devendra fadanvis bhale hi pehle siem hai jo rathyatra par nikalne vaale hai
 However, earlier in the 90s, BJP leader Gopinath Munde took out a 'sangharsh Yatra' against the Congress government in Maharashtra
 is yatra ke jariye bijepi ko rajya ke gramin ilaakon main kaaphi majbootee mili thi
 The result of this visit was that in 1995, bjp-shiv Sena came to power in Maharashtra for the first time
 iske alaava munde ne godavari parikrama yatra bhi kii thi
 After the death of Gopinath Munde and just before the 2014 assembly elections, Pankaja Munde took out a struggle like a father
 is yatra ke jariye pankaja ne obisi samudaay ko bijepi se jodne main ahm bhoomika adaa kii thi
 Pankaja Munde took out Sangharsh Yatra in 79 assembly constituencies of Maharashtra
 is yatra kaa bijepi ko kaaphi phayda mila tha

 Former Bihar Deputy Chief Minister and RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav has said that the BJP government at the Center has not fulfilled the promises, which upset NDA allies

 During a conversation with NDTV, he said - This is because PM Narendra Modi and Amit Shah are very arrogant
 ve apane sahyogiyon ko sammaan nahin dete hai
 If you see, voices of discontent are emerging from allies of BJP across the country and they are warning BJP to leave
 tejasvi yadav ne yah bhi spasht kiya ki mahagathbandhan sirf desh ke liye chintit he na ki koun pradhanmantri banegaa, iske liye
 He said- no one has claimed to be Prime Minister, the Grand Alliance is only worried about problems like farmers committing suicide, unsafe environment for women, unemployment in front of youth and this is being discussed
 tejasvi ne kaha ki centre sarkaar, modi ji or nitish ji sab milakar nagpuria kanoon ko lagu karnaa chaahate hai

 That is, BJP has understood its status, what is its situation in Bihar

 Nitish Kumar's account is not going to open

 The then AIADMK Publicity Secretary Natarajan then proposed that Sasikala would videography Jayalalithaa's programs
 jayalalita bhi shashikala ke kaam se santusht thim
 After this, both their friends were confirmed
 tamilnadu kii purv mukhyamantri jayalalita se mulaakaat ke baad unhone party main teji se apana prabhaav jamaaya
 Jayalalithaa's absence from Poise Gardens to Sasikala ran throughout Tamil Nadu
 jayalalita ne kabhi bhi shashikala ko raajnneeti ke kareeb jane nahin diya
 Even before his death, 'amma' did not advance Chinnamma
 aise main tamilnadu kii janata main ye dharna he ki ammaa bhi chinnamma ko siem banate nahin dekhnaa chaahati thim
 Sasikala Natarajan became party general secretary just days after Jayalalithaa passed away
 unhen siem banane ke liye o paneerselvam ne prastaav rakhaa or siem ke post se khud istifa de diya tha
 However later the political developments in the state changed rapidly and Panneerselvam came in opposition with his supporting faction

 She was extremely close to AIADMK supremo Jayalalithaa
 jayalalita bhi unpar behad vishwaas karti thim
 Both of their friends were very deep
 log to unhen jayalalita kii parchaai tak kaha karte the
 But in 2011, there was a bitterness in their relationship
 iske baad jayalalita ne shashikala ko apni party se nikaal diya
 He had made a complete distance from Sasikala
 haalanki baad main donon ke rishte tab saamaanya ho gaye, jab shashikala ne unase maafee maang lee
 On apologizing, Jayalalitha forgives Sasikala
 baad main shashikala party mahasachiv baniin
 Actually, both Panneerselvam and Sasikala leaders come from the same Thevar community, so there were fears of discord within the party with the formation of two power centers
 haalanki paneerselvam ne khud hi shashikala kaa naam vidhayak dal kii netaa ke taur par prastaavit kar diya tha
 The comments agar dekha jaae to ediemke main jahaan shashikala ke kaaphi samarthak hai, to vahiin duusari taraf unke virdohi bhi kam nahin he
 After Jayalalithaa's death, amidst speculation that Sasikala was being handed over the reins of the party, people had lodged a strong protest on social media
 jayalalita kii bhatiji deepa jayakumar ne bhi shashikala ko avishwasaneey insaan bataaya tha

 JMM BJP-AJSU is also trying to increase reservation to 14% reservation of OBC to 27%
 Engaged in exercise vahiin, jharkhand mukti morcha (jeemem) obisi aarakshan kii naav par savaar hokar satta main vaapasi karnaa chaahati he
 This is the reason why JMM, on the lines of Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, is also trying to create electoral atmosphere in Jharkhand by raising the demand for reservation of 27% to 14% of obcs
 obisi kaa aarakshan pratishat chhattisgarh or madhya pradesh main bhi badhaayaa ja chukaa he
 In both these states, the Congress government has increased OBC reservation from 14 percent to 27 percent
 chhattisgarh kii seemaa jharkhand se lagati he
 In such a situation, Jharkhand also has a direct impact on the political decisions of the neighboring state
 jeemem ke kaaryakari adhyaksh hemanth sorain apni sabhaaon main obisi aarakshan ke daayre ko badhaane kii maang lagaataar kar rahe hai
 Soren has embarked on a transformation journey from his strong support base Santhal Pargana
 iske tahat pradesh ke sabhi jila mukhyalayon main badi reliyaan kar rahe hai, jinamein obisi aarakshan ko 27 fisadi tak karne kii maang uthaayi ja rahi he
 JMM Secretary General Vinod Pandey aajtak
 in se baatcheet karte hue kaha ki jharkhand main obisi samudaay lambey samay se aarakshan ke daayre ko badhaane kii maang kar rahaa he
 Their demand is justified, JMM is raising this issue with full force and will fulfill it when it comes to power
 unhone kaha ki obisi samudaay ke saath bijepi ne dhokhaa kiya he
 The BJP is misleading the OBC community instead of giving them their rights
 bijepi-ajasu kii obisi par najarobisi ke bade vot bank par bijepi bhi puri tarah se majboot pakad banaae rakhana chaahati he
 In Jharkhand, the bjp's All Jharkhand Students Union (AJSU) is also in favor of increasing the OBC reservation cap to 27 per cent
 ajasu ke adhyaksh sudesh mahato ne kai baar yah maang sarkaar ke saamne uthaai he
 The BJP does not want to weaken its hold on OBC voters under any circumstances
 yahi vajah he ki raghuvar das sarkaar ne kai maah pehle pradesh ke upayuktaon ko nirdesh diya tha ki obisi kii aabaadi kaa aankada uplabdh karaayaa jaae
 Due to the Lok Sabha elections this work could not be done
 sarkaar ne phir se tamaam upayuktaon ko reminder bheja he
 The current reservation system in Jharkhand states that at present, Scheduled Tribes are getting 26% reservation, 10% for Scheduled Castes, 14% for obcs and 10% for economically backward upper castes in Jharkhand
 is tarah se pradesh main kul 60 fisadi aarakshan mil rahaa he
 Marandi had played Babulal Marandi, who was the first Chief Minister of Dhanjharkhand, had taken a step to increase the scope of reservation in the state during his tenure, but could not wear it
 marandi ne anusuchit janajati ke liye 32 fisadi, anusuchit jati ko 14 fisadi or obisi ko 27 fisadi aarakshan kaa praavdhaan kiya tha, lekin jharkhand ucch nyaayalay ne 50 fisadi se zyada aarakshan na dene kii vajah se inkaar kar diya tha
 However, now when the Narendra Modi government has taken 10% upper caste reservation steps, the scope of 50% has been broken
 isiilie jeemem apni khoi hui siyaasi jameen ko waapas paane ke liye obisi aarakshan kaa card chal diya he
 In such a situation, it has to be seen how much the people of Jharkhand trust this promise of JMM
 big bos 13 pichhlaa haftaa is sijan kaa ab tak kaa sabase vivaadit haftaa rahaa he
 For the first time in the history of Bigg Boss, all the contestants of the house were seen embarking on a melee together

 Some of the family accused Bigg Boss of being wrong, while others damaged the things of the house
 big boske itane vivaadit hafte ke baad audiyans samet gharavaalon ko bhi weekend kaa waar kaa itanjar tha
 It was meaningless for everyone to know what will be the reaction of Salman Khan after such behavior of the householders
 salmaan ke nishane par sabase zyada paras chhabda, siddharth de or shefali bagga rahe
 Salman also lambasted many contestants for talking dirty about girls
 salmaan khan ne jis tarah gharavaalon ko unki galtiyaan samajhaayin or jis tarah unhone gharavaalon ko handle kiya uske baad salmaan khan kii soshal media par jamkar saraahna ho rahi he
 The users who trolled Salman by accusing him of discriminating against Shahnaz Gill are now also praising Salman and making # besthostsalmankhan trend on social media

 Companies under the purview of the Securities Exchange Board of India (SEBI) may pay annual salaries of crores of rupees to their ceos, but the next head of SEBI will only get a salary of three lakh rupees monthly
 sarkaar ne sebi ke nae chairman ko kul teen lakh rupee kaa masik vetan dene kaa prastaav kiya he
 Accordingly, the annual salary package of Sebi chief would be Rs 36 lakh
 sebi ke vartmaan chairman si bi bhaave kaa kaarykaal farvari, 2011 main puraa ho rahaa he
 Information about the salary of Bhave is not available
 sebi ke niyaman ke daayre main desh kii sabhi soochibaddh companiyaan aati hai
 The annual salary package of ceos and other top executives of most of these companies sits in crores of rupees
 taaja aankadon ke anusaar, 265 companiyon ne suchit kiya he ki 2009-10 main unhone apane pramukhon yaa anya sheersh prabandhan ke adhikariyon ko kam se kam ek karod rupee kaa vetan diya
 Some of these officers got up to ten crore rupees
 haalanki, 2009-10 ke liye 5,000 soochibaddh companiyon main se zyada ke vetan aankadaan kii jaankaree nahin mil pai he, par inamen se kam se kam 500 companiyaan aisi hai, jinhone pichley vitt varsh main sheersh adhikariyon ko karodon rupee vetan ke rup main die hai
 a similar case is related to banking regulator Reserve Bank of India
 kendriya bank ke governor ko duusare bainkaan ke pramukhan kii tulana main kaaphi kam vetan miltaa he
 The special thing is that banks need the approval of the central bank to fix the salaries of their heads
 haalanki, soochibaddh companiyon ke liye apane siio ke vetan ke liye sebi kii manjuuri kii jarurat nahin hoti
 The central government fixes the salaries of the RBI and Sebi chiefs
 sebi ke agle pramukh ke liye aavedan maangane vaali adhisuchana main vitt mantralay ne kaha he ki sebi ke chairman ko bharat sarkaar main sachiv ke pad ke baraabar yaa kul teen lakh rupee kaa vetan kaa bhugtan kiya jayega
 The Finance Ministry has stated that the person applying should have 25 years of professional experience
 or uski umr 50 se 60 saal honi chahie
 The Chairman of SEBI will be appointed for the age of five years or 65 years whichever is earlier
 vah ek baar phir niyukti ke liye bhi paatr hoga
 The government has constituted a high-powered committee under the chairmanship of Cabinet Secretary KM Chandrasekhar for the selection of Sebi chairman

 Hardik Patel has also changed his stance following the announcement of reservation for Marathas in Maharashtra
 pichley 3 saal se gujarat main patidaaron ke liye aarakshan kii maang kar rahe hardik guuruuvaar ko obisi ayog pahunche
 Hardik Patel demands that the OBC Panch survey the Patidars
 maharashtra main lambey vakt se maratha aarakshan kii maang kar rahe the, jise obisi ayog ke survey ke baad maharashtra kii fadanvis sarkaar ne aarakshan dene kii ghoshnaa kar di he
 In such a situation, the Patidar leaders reached the OBC Commission in Gandhinagar with the demand for reservation
 hardik patel or unki team kii ore se ayog ke adhyaksh sugana bhatta ke saamne maang rakhi gai ki, kam se kam patidaaron kaa survey karavaaya jaae taaki aarakshan ko lekar doodh kaa doodh or pani kaa pani ho jaae
 Hardik Patel also raised many questions about the attitude of Vijay Rupani government of Gujarat
 hardik patel kaa kahana he ki maharashtra main bijepi kii sarkaar bane mahaj 4 saal hi hue hai, vahaan aarakshan diya ja rahaa he, to gujarat main to pichley 25 saal se bijepi kii sarkaar he
 For the last 3 years, the Patidars have been continuously demanding reservation in Gujarat
 hardik patel kii maang he ki obisi kota jin logon ko mila hua he usamen wo koi khalal pahunchaana nahin chaahate
 The commission should survey Patidars and try to give them reservation on economic basis
 vahiin, hardik patel kaa kahana he ki, gujarat main chunaav se pehle kamjor tabakon ke liye congress ne aarakshan kii baat kahi thi, aise main congress se bhi hamaari maang he ki, wo patidaaron ke liye sheetakaaleen satr main ek privet bill lekar aae
 As the BJP is thinking of bringing it for the Ram temple, a private bill of reservation for Patidars should be brought on the same lines
 hardik patel ne patidaar ko aarthik or saamaajik taur par aarakshan mili iske liye 11 pannon ki ek yachika obisi ayog ko diya he
 However, the OBC Commission has said to think on the demand for survey of Hardik Patel
 bharat kii diggaj nishanebaaj hina siddhu ne haal hi main kaha tha ki bharat ko 2022 main birmingham main hone vaale rashtramandal khelon ke bahishkaar ke bare main vichaar karnaa chahie
 Hina said this when shooting was decreed not to be included in the next Commonwealth Games
 hina ko ab bhartiya olympic sangh (ioe) ke adhyaksh narendar batra kaa samarthan mila he, jinhone kaha ki khelon kaa bahishkaar ek vikalp ho saktaa he
 Batra has written an e-mail to Sports Minister Kiran Rijiju informing that informal discussions have started between the IOA members
 batra ne jo mail likhaa he uski ek prati ieenes ke paas he
 "it is in relation to the statement made by the IOA Secretary General in May-2019 which stated that the idea of not participating in Commonwealth Games- xxrep 4 2 can be discussed
" is mudde par ab anaupchaarik taur par ioe sadasyon ke bich charchaa jari he or vah ioe ke mahasachiv rajeev mehta ke vichaaron se sahamat hai
 Earlier, the National Rifle Association of India (NRAI) Secretary General Rajiv Bhatia had told IANS that nothing could be done after the decision not to include shooting as the final decision on the issue has been taken by the organizing committee
 bhaatia ne kaha, 'aapako main kya bataaun ki hamane kya kya nahin kiya, lekin aayojan samiti hamaari sunne ko taiyaar nahin thi
 He told us that we do not want to waste money on shooting
 finance hi unhone ek maatr kaaran diya
 They are not ready to listen to anything
 hamane kaaphi kuch kiya, hamane is par sansad main bahes bhi karwaai, lekin aayojan samiti maanane ko hi taiyaar nahin he
 In June, the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) decided that shooting would not be given a place in the Games to be held in 2022
 1970 ke baad se aisa pehali baar hoga ki rashtramandal khelon main nishanebaaji nahin hogi
 This has dealt a big blow to India because if India stays ahead of the medal table in these games, a big reason behind this is the medals won in shooting

" peedita ne saath hi atul johari par yah aarope bhi lagaae ki unki baat na maanane par professor ne uske research work ko roke rakhaa
 At the same time, the victim also accused the department and high officials of not taking action on her complaints
 peedita ne kaha ki ab tak usne yah sochakar professor atul johari ke khilaaf police main shikaayat nahin kii ki kahin uskaa research work baadhit na ho jaae

 vah is tarah ke joke sunaate rahete the or research work ke bare main discus karne ke liye apane offis bulaate rahete the
 The victim further said in her statement, "when i went to his office, instead of the chair, he used to make me sit next to him on the sofa and awkwardly rubbed my back and shoulders without my permission
" yah sab mere liye bahut hi asahaj karne vaala tha
 Once in 2014, when i went to the lab to talk to him about my synopsis, he made uncomfortable comments about my organs and said, "maintain your body, otherwise you will become ugly like other girls
" mere manaa karne kaa bhi un par koi asar nahin hua
 The victim said that when she told her fellow students about the antics of the jeweler, and when the professor came to know about this, he started behaving with maliciousness towards her
 peedita ne kaha, 'unhone mere liye padhai kaa maahaul dubhar kar diya or mere research work par dhyaan dena bhi band kar diya or mere saare asinaments rokkar rakhane lage
 After this i also tried to change my lab, but the department did not support me
 maine apane dean ko bataaya ki meraa yon shoshan kiya ja rahaa he or main apana suparvizer badalanaa chaahati hum
 But since i could not change my lab, i had to do research under the guidance of Professor Johri
 "peedita ne kaha, "maine janvari, 2017 main hi apana manuskript professor johari ko de diya tha, lekin ab tak unhone koi jawaab nahin diya he
 Any girl who opposed these dirty antics would interrupt her research work, as she did with me
 main behad tanaav main or chintit hum, kyonki mujhe apana research july main jamaa karnaa he
 So far i have not complained to the police just because i was worried about completing my phd, but during this time i remained very uncomfortable
 "peedita ne police ko bataaya ki professor johari kii patni aksar lab aati rahati thim or hamen shaam 6 baje ke baad lab main na rukne kii salaah detii thim
 But when i heard the news about other girl students complaining against Atul Johri, i also decided to complain

 film: titaleediarector: kanu bahalastar cast: shashaank aroda, amit sayaal ,lalit bahal , ranvir shouri, shivani raghuvanshivadhi: 1 ghanta 57 minutesrtificate:aretimga: 2
 Kanu Bahl, director of 5 Starfilm 'titli', has previously worked as an assistant director in a number of films of producer director Dibakar Banerjee
 kanu ne 'lav sex or dhokhaa' film ko likhane main bhi sahaayta kii he
 This time Dibakar has given Kanu Bahl the opportunity to direct the film 'titli' and is also producing the film along with Yash Raj Films himself
 aaie jaanate hai ki kanu kii titali kitni udaan bhar pai he
 Kahani This is a story of a robber family in Delhi headed by Daddy (lalit Bahl) and their three sons Vikram (ranveer Shorey), Bavla (amit Sayal) and Titli (shashank Arora)
 parivaar kaa bijness sirf luutmaar kaa he jise ghar ke donon bade bhai vikram or pradeep to aage badhaate hai lekin sabase chote titali kaa is kaam main man nahin lagata or wo sab chhod chhaad ke aage bad janaa chahta he
 Meanwhile, there are many twists in the story including the wedding of the butterfly
 ab kya titali apane makasad main kaamyaab ho paata he yaa gharavaalon kii vajah se lutpaat main lag jaataa he? ye jaanane ke liye aapkofils dekhni jaruri he
 The story of the scriptfilm itself is written by director Kanu Bahl in collaboration with Sharat Kataria, which depicts the life of a family of a different kind of thinking
 film main kalpana se bachane kii koshish kii gai he
 The film's family is a typical 'male-dominated' family
 film main hinsa apni charam seemaa par dikhaai padataa he or lutpaat ke liye bahut sara khun kharaba dikhaaya gaya he
 After so much time, this violence starts to bore
 script film ko baandhakar rakh paane main kai jagah asafal ho jaati he
 On one hand, the story of the film shows the importance of 'money', while the story of making a romantic angle in it starts going elsewhere
 dark film main chamakdaar lav story ghusaane kii koshish kii gai he
 Ranveer Shorey has done a great acting in the role of Abhinavikram, while the work of Shashank, who is playing the title, is admirable
 bawalaa ke kirdaar main amit sayaal ne behtareen acting kii he khaas taur se kuch gambhir seens main to wo kaaphi jame hai
 If a good director is looking for a smooth acting artist then Amit Sayal can complete his search
 film main chaar mardon ke bich nilu urf shivani ne bhi ek majboot ladki ke rup main acha kaam kiya he
 Weak Link The weak link of the film is its scattered script
 gambhir or dark kahani ke saath-saath lav story kaa angel film ko khichdi bana detaa he
 The film binds the audience before Interval, but after that there is a lot of drama in the script
 kul jamaa baat he ki script or bhi crisp, kasi hui or tu da point ho sakati thi
 If you are an adult, love dark films and are convinced of over-realist cinema, then you can watch this movie
 muaavja maang rahe kisaanon par police kaa lathichargetrans ganga city project ke liye kisaanon kii jameen adhigrahitunnav main kisaanon ke khilaaf police karrwai ke baad uttar pradesh kii yogi sarkaar par vipaksh hamalavar ho gaya he
 Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi on Sunday lashed out at the Yogi government over the brutal police action on farmers
 unhone police karrwai kaa ek video bhi twitor par share kiya he
 In this video, the policeman is seen hitting a farmer lying on the ground with a stick
 priyanka gandhi ne yogi sarkaar par nishaanaa sadhate hue twit kiya, 'uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri abhi gorakhpur main kisaanon par badi-badi baaten kar rahe hai, unki police kaa haal dekhie
 In Unnao, a farmer has become half dead after eating sticks
 use or maaraa ja rahaa he
 Eyes should be bowed down with shame, those who grow food for you, such cruelty with them? ' However, after some time Priyanka Gandhi deleted this tweet
 vahiin upi ke purv mukhyamantri or sapa pramukh akhilesh yadav ne twit kar kaha ki, 'uttar pradesh main kisaanon ko trans ganga city project kii zamin ke uchit muaavze kii jagah bhaajapa kii lathi mil rahi he, ganne kaa mulya nahin mil rahaa, khadi fasal aawaara pashu kha rahe hai, desh main anndaataaon kii aatmahatyaayein badhati ja rahi hai
 
 
 Is this the definition of development under BJP rule
 'kyon bhadke kisaan?unnav main uttar pradesh rajya audyogic vikaas nigam kii trans ganga city pariyojna ke tahat kisaanon kii jameen adhigrahit kii gai
 But the farmers say that the compensation given was very low
 kisaan or muaavje kii maang ko lekar kai dinon se dharna pradarshan kar rahe the
 Later, when the police tried to calm the protest, the matter deteriorated and a clash ensued between the two
 yahaan tak ki kisaanon ke gusse ko shant karne ke liye police ko lathi charge bhi karnaa padaa
 Protesting farmers have pelted stones at JCB and cart
 iske baad jila prashasan kii taraf se 12 thanon kii police or kai company piesi ko maukey par bheja gaya
 Along with this, the officials of the Tehsil Department under the leadership of City Magistrate also reached the spot
 darasal, prashasan shanivaar ko kisaanon kii jameen par jesibi chalavaae jane ke baad kisaan ugr ho gaye
 The farmers got angry and threw stones at JCB
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki maukey par ab bhi baari force tainaat he
 What is the whole case? The farmers alleged that their lands were acquired without agreement in 2005, but were not being compensated in return
 iske virodh main ham sadak par utre hai
 In fact, the whole matter is of the Trans Ganges City of UPSIDC, where the farmers are continuously protesting due to non-fulfillment of the acquisition conditions

 Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Congress General Secretary and in-charge of Eastern Uttar Pradesh, started the election campaign on Monday
 priyanka prayagraj se boat par savaar hokar ganga nadi par kaashi tak kaa safar kar rahi hai
 Today is the third day of his visit
 upi main ganga nadi 1160 kilometre lambaai main bahati he
 Priyanka Gandhi is traveling in 140 kilometers of it
 raste main padane vaali paanch loksabhaa siton ke logon se priyanka sidhe sampark kar unhen saadhane kii koshish bhi kar rahi hai
 However, from Prayagraj to Varanasi at present, the Congress neither has any MP nor any MLA
 uttar pradesh main pichley teen dashak se ventilator par padi congress main jaan daalane ke liye priyanka gandhi chunavi ranbhumi main utar chuki hai
 Priyanka started her election campaign from her native city Allahabad and residence Swaraj Bhavan, from here Priyanka Gandhi tried to convey a big political message
 iske baad maa ganga, kai mandiron or mirzapur main ismail chishti kii dargah par maathaa tekte hue priyanka aaj varanasi pahunch rahi hai
 His visit is considered to be an exercise in religious, political, economic and social practice
 maa ganga karodon bharatiyon ke liye aadhyatm or aasthaa kaa strot hai
 Priyanka has started her election campaign from Prayagraj to Kashi by calling herself Ganga's daughter
 is yatra kii shuruyaat priyanka gandhi ne prayag main hanuman mandir kaa darshan karke kii
 Then worshiped the Ganges, after which she left for Kashi on board a boat
 bijepi, sapa or basapa ne chhina votbankelahabaad se varanasi ke bich congress kii raajnneetik jameen puri tarah se khiski hui najar aa rahi he
 This traditional political land of Congress is occupied by BJP, BSP, SP and Apna Dal
 priyanka gandhi ne prayagraj se varanasi ke bich 140 kimi kaa jo safar tay kiya he
 Under him, Allahabad, Phulpur, Bhadohi, Mirzapur and Varanasi directly affect the Lok Sabha seats
 in paanch sansadeey siton ke tahat kareeb 25 vidhansabha siten aati hai
 There is not a single MLA in 25 seats
 In the current time, politically, Congress does not have one seat out of five Lok Sabha and 25 Assembly seats
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ne paanchon siten jiti thi, lekin baad main hue upachunaav main phulpur seat bijepi ne ganvaa di he
 In this way, BJP currently has four and one SP
 vidhansabha chunaav ke nattejey ko dekhen to 25 main se congress ke paas ek bhi vidhayak nahin he
 While BJP has 16, BSP has 2, Apna Dal has three, SP and Nishad Party have one each
 kabhi congress kaa garh tha yah ilaakahaalanki, ek daur main desh ke pehle pradhanmantri pandit jawahar laal nehru kii karmbhumi phulpur rahi he
 By choosing from this seat, he became the Prime Minister of the country
 iske alaava uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri kamalapati treepathi kaa garh bhi varanasi rahaa he
 Despite this, the Congress has not been able to keep its fort
 aise main priyanka gandhi congress ke puraane durg ke siyaasi kile ko durust karne kii disha main kadam badhaayaa he
 Priyanka Gandhi's visit from Prayagraj to Varanasi has been considered as the first step towards strengthening the Congress
 priyanka gandhi ne is yatra ke jariye apane aapako vahaan ke logon se jodne or vipaksh ke kabje main apni raajnneetik jameen ko dobaaraa se waapas paane ke kavayad main dekha ja rahaa he
 In such a situation, how far Priyanka succeeds in her efforts? china kii dadagiri ko rokane ke liye ab bhartiya sena apni takat badhaane ke saath-saath do kubad vaale uunton ko bhi chini seemaa par tainaat karne ja rahi he
 There is a common saying, 'camel came down the mountain' but here the matter is another
 yahaan pahaad hi oont ke neeche aa rahaa he
 Actually, the border between India and China is surrounded by the Himalayan hills
 in simavarti ilaakon ke pahaado kii oonchai 12,000 se 22000 feet kii he
 Like humans in these areas, it is more difficult for animals too
 in ilaakon membhartiya sensobhi tak saamaan dhone ke liye khachcharon kaa istemaal karti ai he lekin ek khachchar maatr 40 kilo vazan hi uthaa paata he
 In view of the circumstances, the Indian Army will now employ only two hump camels to carry military goods
 do kubad vaale ye oont mushkil halaat main naa sirf zyada samay tak jinda rah pate hai balki khachcharon se paanch guna zyaada vajan uthaane ke liye bhi sakasham hai
 This is why double hump camels will be used in these areas now
 saath hi saath is ilaake main yah oont chaak-chauband bhi rah paaenge
 The specialty of camels with double humps is that species of camel which are found in areas with low temperature and cold desert

 He said that Yoga Day is not part of any common minimum program
 nitish kumaar ji niyamit yoga karte hai
 The JDU leader said that as far as the sharing of seats is concerned, till now the Bharatiya Janata Party has not discussed with us at any stage
 2019 chunaav ke maddenjar siton ke bantwaare parakesi tyaagi ne kahaaki jo euaspy he vah nitish kumaar hai
 There were two seats in 2014 but our vote was 16 percent
 jab vah bijepi ke saath jud gaya tab bijepi upar chali gai

 iskaa matlab yah nahin he ki jadyu kii dadagiri he
 This means that the Wider Participation of Nitish Kumar Image in NDA

 mira kumaar ne raajnneeti ke upar uthakarrashtrapati chunaavamein voting kii apil kii he
 He has written in the letter that the electoral college has a chance to create history and forget all the differences and take a decision by listening to the voice of the soul
 mira kumaar ko 17 dalon kaa samarthanrashtrapati ummidavaar chunane ke liye sansad bhawan main 22 june ko vipaksh kii baithak hui or mira kumaar kaa naam tay hua
 The meeting was attended by leaders of 17 opposition parties
 ensipi ke sharad pavaar ne mira kumaar ke naam kaa prastaav rakhaa
 The opposition says that they will appeal to the secular parties to support Meira Kumar

 Three years ago, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh used to be a national hero, but today SMS is the superstar of the world of jokes
 agar koi murkh achaanak saamaanya baat karne lage, to log uski prashansa karne lagate hai
 Conversely, if a hero slips while performing a stunt, he is judged by the peaks he has ever conquered
 jis matadaata ne 2009 main dow
 Singh was chosen because he had won the peak of Kanchenjunga, he had also hoped that by 2012 he would reach Everest
 isaki bajaae matadaataaon ko palat kar kah diya gaya he ki yojana badal di gai he, aaie baithkar is mandi kaa anand len kyonki hamaara doorsanchaar vaala aadmi paisa lekar bhaag gaya he or aajkal tihaad main chhuttiyaan bitaa rahaa he
 There is no reason for voter confusion
 usne ek baar nahin, kai baar spasht janadesh diya he, jaankaron ko galat sabit kiya he or netaaon ko chaunkaaya he
 He needs a strong government in return
 ho yah rahaa he ki jeetne vaala aise bartaav kar rahaa he, jaise ki jeet hasil karke vah kamjor ho gaya he
 This dangerous disease is not only for the Congress, but also others
 karnataka main bhaajapa ne aitihaasik janadesh kaa apmaan apni ochhi maansikta ke pradarshan se kar daalaa he
 Look at Andhra, where the Congress first ended its opposition and then eliminated itself
 pi
 Chidambaram turned around on the issue of Telangana first, then sat down
 rajasekhar reddy kii maut ek haadase main ho gai, to party ne pehle to ek boodha uttaradhikari thope diya, uske baad usase kuch yuva netritv thopa gaya jisane abhi-abhi apni tankhwaah 400 pratishat badha lee he
 The administration also died along with Rajasekhara Reddy
 uske baad congress ne aisa bujuval khelaa or itane moorkhtapurna tareeke se khelaa ki matadaata ab hans rahaa he to uske aansu nikal rahe hai
 Look at Akhilesh Yadav, what did he do with such a brilliant mandate? There can be nothing more ridiculous symbol of the agreement that the incarcerated leader be made a policeman
 ho saktaa he ki akhilesh mazaakia kism ke shaks hon, lekin agar yah majaak he, to nihaayat bhadda he
 The voter wants the Akhilesh who bahubali d
 pi
 Yadav was not given the ticket, not the one who just kept smiling while the minister with criminal background kept swearing in front of him
 baharhaal, akhilesh ke paas ab bhi vakt he or unka asli imtahaan pehali nahin, unki duusari cabinet hogi
 At the moment, they have to combine things according to their inheritance and succession
 lekin unke paas bahut zyada vakt nahin he kyonki bhartiya loktantr ab apane sabase samvedansheel charan main pahunch chukaa he
 The difference between a weak and strong government is no longer complicated

 When the DMK blackmailed the Prime Minister on the Indian side at the United Nations over the persecution of Sri Lankan citizens in the last phase of the war against the LTTE, Dr
 singh ke paas samjhaute or tark ke bich spasht vikalp tha
 He could have negotiated options with his colleagues in the government, sympathetic to the dmk's concerns, if he wished
 unhen yah spasht kehane kii jarurat nahin thi ki bharat kii videsh niti ko gathbandhan kii majaburiyon kaa bandhak nahin banaaya ja saktaa
 But he 'bowed down' to the dmk's point of view
 baad main kaaphi soch-vichaar kar dow
 Singh said that his UPA colleagues are a headache
 darasal, dow
 Singh's illness is not the handiwork of his colleagues, but his own Congress party has made fun of him
 uttar pradesh chunaav prachaar ke dauraan kuch cabinet mantriyon ne dam bharaa tha ki gaddi to rahul gandhi kii hi he, wo to dow
 The lion is seated on it which can be removed at any time
 pradhanmantri is par chup rahe
 Sonia Gandhi also did nothing
 sochie, yadi unhone yah maang kar daali hoti ki dow
 If Singh was made the Congress President in place of Sonia Gandhi, then how long he could have survived
 aisa nahin ki achaanak hue kisi visphot main koi gathbandhan lupt ho jaataa he, balki ek vishaal agnikand kii khwaahish main dhire-dhire uthati lapten use kamjor karti hai
 Whether it is Congress in Delhi or BJP in Karnataka, all political parties keep comforting themselves that destruction can be kept away from the importance of time and power

 Saphala Ekadashi has special significance in Hinduism
 is din sristi ke rachayita shri hari vishnu kii puja kaa vidhaan he

 puranic manyataon ke anusaar jo koi bhakt sachche man or shraddha se is ekadshi (ekadashi) kaa vrath karata he uske saare paap nasht ho jate hai or use jivan ke sabhi kaaryon main safalataa milti he
 In the end he decided to steal

 After some time, the whole city became fearful
 vah van main rahakar pashu aadi ko markar khaane laga
 Citizens and state employees would capture him but leave him in fear of the king
 van ke ek atipracheen vishaal pipal kaa vriksh tha
 People worshiped him like a god
 usee vriksh ke neeche vah mahapapi lumpak rahaa karata tha
 People considered this forest to be the playground of the gods
 kuch samay pashchaat pus krishna paksh kii dashami ke din vah vastraheen hone ke kaaran sheet ke chalate sari raatri so nahin sakaa
 His arms and legs fluttered
 suryoday hote-hote vah moorchhit ho gaya
 On the second day of Ekadashi, the heat of the sun was overcome at midday
 girtaa-padataa vah bhojan kii talash main niklaa
 He was not able to kill the animals, so after picking the fruits that fell under the trees, he came back under the same peepal tree
 us samay tak bhagwaan surya ast ho chuke the
 Placing fruit under the tree, he started saying - o God! Now this is your dedication
 aap hi trupt ho jaaie
 Due to grief that night, i could not sleep at night also
 uske is upwas or jaagran se bhagwaan atyant prasann ho gaye or uske saare paap nasht ho gaye
 The next day in the morning a beautiful horse decorated with many beautiful things came in front of him
 usee samay akashwani hui ki he raajputr! shrinarayan kii krupa se tere paap nasht ho gaye
 Now go to your father and get the kingdom
 aisi vaani sunakar vah atyant prasann hua or divya vastra dhaaran karke ‘bhagwaan aapaki jai ho' kahkar apane pita ke paas gaya
 Pleased with his father, he handed over the weight of the entire kingdom and took the path of the forest
 ab lumpak shastranusaar rajya karne laga
 His family, son etc
 The whole family became the ultimate devotee of Lord Narayana
 vruddh hone par vah bhi apane putr ko rajya kaa bhaar saunpkar van main tapasya karne chalaa gaya or ant samay main vaikunth ko praapt hua
 Therefore, the person who observes this supreme holy Safala Ekadashi gets liberation in the end

 In every case, the governor has to intervene, so understand the serious issue
 tejasvi ne kaha ki ham to dhanyavad dete hai mahamahim rajyapal kaa ki wo har masale ko lekar hastkshep karne kaa kaam kiya he
 It would have been nice if our uncle Nitish Kumar had said that if any child is upset then call us at 2:00 pm also
 magar jo kaam mukhyamantri ko karnaa chahie vah rajyapal kar rahe hai
 Tejashwi further said that one incident after another is happening, Muzaffarpur, Nalanda, Jehanabad or Gaya is a very painful event
 nitish kumaar ji kehete the ki raat main 12:00 baje tak ladkiyaan khule main gum sakati hai

 Since last year, his government has come through the thief door of double engine, since then the engine has been engaged in crime and crime graph has increased so fast that everything is failing in Bihar
 purv upmukhyamantrine kaha ki grih mantralay to unke under main tha, to aise logon ko to kadi se kadi sajaa milani chahie
 The guilty should not be reduced to death sentence
 rajya main tarah-tarah kaa kanoon banataa he lekin lagu koun karegaa, koi pataa nahin

 yah sthiti aa gai he ki log sochenge apni bacchiyon ko baahar bhejne se pehle ki waapas aaenge ki nahin aaenge, agar aaenge bhi to kis haalat main aaenge
 On the RJD leaders accusing the victim of harassing the victim, Tejashwi said that we are not making it an issue, nor giving any political form
 vipaksh ke hone ke naate agar kisi ko insaaf nahin mil rahaa he to ham logon ne cameti banaai he vahaan jaakar ke dekhen, logon ko nyaay mil rahaa he
 The government's own failure of administration is being imposed on the opposition
 isamen sirf rajaneta hi kyon kai log jo media kii bite lene gaye hai, unke liye bhi sawaal tha
 Especially in the clip that i have seen, he said that if i do not speak in the media, then the government will take action against those in the media
 tejasvi ne aage kaha ki jo sachai he sachai ko ujagar karnaa samasya kaa hal nahin he
 If the Governor is saying that call me then what else can be a serious issue
 yahaan to kai logon ne kya-kya baaten nahin kahi thim, kis tarah se banaavat kar ke aansu pochhne log jaaya karte the
 Why are the same people sitting here taking a dip in the house, we like it when Nitish Kumar goes to meet and listen to him, then perhaps the confidence is awakened
 upmukhyamantri susheel modi to har jagah pahunche rahete the, aaj kyon nahin ja rahe hai
 Is she not his child, the silence of the Chief Minister and the Deputy Chief Minister of Bihar does not break the silence in these matters and it is the same people who are engaged in giving air to Jungle Raj

 mantri gopal raay ne sadan main kaha ki desh main 29 rajya hai
 Haryana, UP, Maharashtra were made full states
 manipur-goa jaise chote rajyon ko bhi purna rajya kaa darja diya gaya lekin dilli ko nahin
 If Delhi were a full state today, the pace of work would have been 10 times higher, the work speed is less due to not having full state status
 gopal raay ne bataaya ki dilli kii satta kaa anubhav rakhane vaale bijepi netaa madanlaal khurana, laalkrishna adwani ne khud purna rajya kii maang ko rakhaa tha

 They did not know that Delhi would expand so much

 The central government should have all the control over there
 endiemasi kshetra ko centre apane alji ke paas rakhe or baaki dilli ko mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ko de den
 Then let's see who will do more work
 aapako bataa den ki supreme court se dilli sarkaar or centre sarkaar ke bich adhikaron ko lekar aae faisle ke baad aam aadmi party ne purna rajya ke mudde ko jor-shor se janata ke bich uthaane kaa elaan kiya he

 After a resounding win against Pakistan, Team India has a match against Bangladesh in the ICC World T20 today and would like to maintain this rhythm
 saath hi team india ko yah muqabla bade antar se jeetna hoga kyonki semifinal kii raah main is baar ran rate ke ahm kirdaar nibhaane kii sambhaavna he
 The Indian team lost their first match against New Zealand
 ab aage team agar ek or match haar jaati he to semifinal kii raah mushkil ho jaaegi
 At the same time, Bangladesh had to face defeat in both their matches
 use pehle match main pakistan ne haraaya to duusare main australia se shikast khaani padi
 In such a situation, he will have to win both his next matches by a big margin
 agar timen group daur ke ant main do-do match hi jitati hai to semifinal main jane ke liye tiimon ke ran rate ko dekhakar faisla liya jayega
 In this sense, teams will have to win by a big margin
 isse pehle donon timen asia cap ke final main aamane-saamne hui thim
 India then lifted the trophy by defeating Bangladesh
 tab viraat ne bharat ko jeet kii dahalij tak pahunchane main ahm bhoomika nibhaai thi
 Virat was the only one to win India against Pakistan
 top order ko karnaa hoga parformrohit sharma, shikhar dhawan or suresh raina ne pakistan ke khilaaf fail rahe tab yuvaraj ke saath kohli ne ahm saajhedaari nibhaai
 Although Yuvraj Singh has not played a very big innings for which he is known, but in the crisis, he always stood with Virat and won the team by winning important partnership
 pakistan ke khilaaf bhi unhone sankat ke samay wicket par khadey rahakar viraat kaa saath diya tha
 He always played small but important innings
 bangladesh ke khilaaf unase badi pari kii ummid hogi
 For Dhoni, the biggest concern in batting is the absence of Suresh Raina in form
 vah balle se koi kamaal nahin dikhaa paae hai
 Dhoni, however, said after the match with Pakistan that he had confidence in Raina
 buudhvaar ko dhoni chahenge kii raina unke bharose par khara utren
 Apart from this, Dhawan's form is also becoming a cause of concern for the team
 aaj ke match main shuruaati teenon ballebaajon ko acha score karnaa hoga
 The best thing for the team is for their bowlers to be in excellent form
 bhartiya team beete kai saalon se gendbaajon kii samasya se jujh rahi thi, lekin anbhavi ashish nehra, ravichandran aswin or yuva jasprit bumraah ne team ko naa sirf is sankat se ubaara balki ek majboot gendbaaji akraman kii neenv rakhi
 All-rounder Hardik Pandya supported the team in both batting and bowling
 vah haalanki shuruaati kuch maichon ke baad balle se ran nahin bana paae hai lekin gendbaaji main unhone hameshaa hi team ko safalataa dilaai he
 India will not take Bangladesh lightly, on the other hand Bangladesh may have lost both their matches but it is capable of defeating any team
 apane antim match main australia ke khilaaf usne ant tak ladaai kii thi or kangaaroon ko pareshaan kar rakhaa tha
 In such a situation, India cannot take it lightly
 bangladesh ke liye sabase badi chintaa tameem ikbaal kaa swasthy naa hona he
 He is the axis of the team's batting, but due to ill he did not play against Australia
 team chaahegi kii vah thik hokar jaldi vaapasi karen
 For Bangladesh, Arafat Sunny and Taskin Ahmed have suffered a major setback after being banned from bowling
 yahaan bangladesh in donon ke jane se thodi kamjor jarur lag rahi he
 At the same time, the return of Mustafizur Rahman from injury for Bangladesh is a good sign for the team
 vah bharat ke khilaaf hameshaa acha pradarshan karte aae hai
 Veteran team player Shakib Al Hasan has always been a threat to India
 vah balle or gend se team ke liye hameshaa upyogi yogadan karte aae hai

 lekin ab ek aisa video saamne aayaa he jisamen kaha ja rahaa he ki china ke pipuls libration army ke faujee hindustani sarhad main ghus aae hai, wo bhi arunachal pradesh kii seemaa ke bheetar
 Evidence of the entry of Chinese troops into the Tawang area of arunachal Pradesh is found in a video

 Intrusive live pictures of China can be seen in this video

 Our soldiers were shocked that China entered our border, that's why our soldiers told the Chinese soldiers that you have penetrated very deep into our border
 lekin chini faujee to maanon kuch maanane yaa sunne ko taiyaar hi nahin the
 The result was that Indian troops had to fight with Chinese troops for the protection of the border

 rajeev sethi ke asia heritage foundation ke mukhyalay ke taur par do dashakon tak kaam karne ke baad bhartiya shilpakala kii misaalon se ata padaa kai kamaron vaala ahaata ab bulldozeron ke hawaale kiya ja rahaa he
 By the end of this month, all the goods here will be closed in coaches
 dilli ke south ekstansion main sthit yah imaarat us kaam ke liye khuli rahi he, jise sethi 'saarvajanik padtaal' kehete hai
 It used to be an opportunity for people to take stock of contemporary art items themselves
 inamen jacket or sadiiyon se lekar sofe, lampashed, khilaunon or julri tak kai kalatmak chijen shaamil rahi hai
 Sethi says that these craftsmen are the 'creators of the story' and "in a knowledge-based economy it is their skill that we need to improve
" yah vah hunar he jisaki baaki duniya barabari nahin kar sakati
 "sethi gets along very easily with every person hovering around his office
" chaahe ve vahaan se guzar rahe arbapati hon, adhyeta, daftar ke saathi, patrkaar, utsuk aagatuk hon yaa japani sailaani jo unhen aise shaks ke taur par pahachaanate hai jo unke hotel, bunakaron, sangeetkaaron, natbaajon or kathputli kaa khel dikhaane waalon kii kala ke peeche rahaa he
 Sethi has stayed at various places
 unhone es
 Wetter, Ray and Charles Eames, Pierre Cardin, Pupul Jayakar, Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay have learned and guided them
 ve sabhi se mili hai; unki kitaab main ek kaali-safed tasviir he jisamen ve jaiki kennedy ke saath sanjeeda baatcheet main mubtila hai
 For half a century, Sethi has been a vanguard of Indian craftsmen
 sethi ne 1980 ke dashak ke madhya main neuyork or washington main hindustani dastakaari kii badi pradarshaniyaan lagaai thi
 It was not a tradition preserved in aspic, but rather a skill that was made new, contemporary and friendly
 aisa hunar jise pashchimi dizinron ne nikharaa tha
 This meeting of East and West was also not as much as it was about a kind of emotional crusade
 disambar 1985 main neuyork times se baat karte hue sethi ne isi praasangikta kii joardaar vakaalat kii thiah ''hamen ek korporate logo kii jarurat thi jo saaf-saaf bataae ki 'maid in india' kaa matlab 'sasta or ghatiya' nahin he
 
 
 We are talking about serious design internationally
 ''tab se 30 se zyada saal biit chuke hai
 This thing still needs to be said
 pradhanmantri kii 'mek in india' muhim paaramparik dastkaron kii ahmiyat ko sweekaar karti he, magar uske paas us vishaal vaishvik bazaar (kuch anumaanon ke mutabik, dastakaari kaa bazaar 2019 tak 700 arab dollar kaa ho saktaa he) main paith banane kii koi yojana dikhaai nahin detii, jisamen hindustan kaa hissaa naganya he
 Sethi says that in his meetings with the Planning Commission and now NITI Aayog, he has been emphasizing for decades that this is a very important creative industry with tremendous potential
 neshnal institute of dizin (jahaan 1960 ke dashak main sethi ne padhai kii thi) ke professor ashok chatarji is baat par afsos jataate hai ki bharat main vishwa str kii pratibha kii kadra nahin he
 In contrast, Chatterjee says that even cars and technology companies in Japan take inspiration from traditional crafts
 ve walcoman kaa hawala dete hai jo atyant sookshm kalakaari ke paaramparik japani gyaan ke saath gunthi hui technology kaa utpaada he
 Then why can't Hindustani manufacturers turn to traditional artisans? Sethi Hindustani is planning to make the knowledge of traditional handicrafts the foundation of the economy
 yah bade paimaane par swa-rojgaar kaa or niryaat kaa kaarykram hoga
 He says that the general government's attitude has been to regard these traditional handicrafts as 'sinking fields', "whereas in reality they are the future
 '' dastakaari ke hunar ko lekar afasarshahon or siyasatdanon ko itane lambey vakt se manaate aa rahe sethi, khaskar tab jab unamem se zyaadaatar ne berukhi hi dikhaai he, kya yah ummid banaae rakh sakate hai ki koi na koi to sunegaa?germany main sinographer shabd ke bare main sunne ke baad sethi khud ko sinographer kehane lage
 In fact, the Sinographer Theater is responsible for the synergy between all the visual effects — that is, the looks of the set, the costumes, the lighting, all the work that is often done by different experts
 sethi ko sinographer kii vah jimmedaari acchhee lagi jisamen use anginat takneekee pahaluon ko saath laakar ek makul vijan pesh karnaa hota he
 So they formed a company incorporating the term
 nateeja yah hua ki tex ke muddon ko lekar unhen varshon adaalat ke chakkar lagane pade kyonki afasarshahon ko lagata tha ki ve stenographer the, jo apni sevaaon ko galat dhang se pesh kar rahe hai
 He says, "well now many young people call themselves cyanographers
 ''apane saath kaam kar rahe dastkaron or kalakaaron ke badale hue halaat main unhen ummid kii kiran najar aati he
 Take, for example, the traditional rope weavers
 jab unhen apane hunar ke istemaal se lampashed banane ke liye nae sire se taiyaar kiya gaya, to inhen bunakaron ne paaya ki unhen lagaataar achche mehtaane vaale kaam mil rahe hai
 Government officials may have disappointed Sethi, but corporate patrons and public-private partnerships have occasionally given him shelter
 unke mashhoor 'festival of india' ke hote hue bhi unki sabase badi kamyaabi mumbai airport ke tii2 ko kaha ja saktaa he jise unhone apane kalatmak nazariye kii numaaish main badal diya
 He stamped Indian originality in a boring place like an international airport
 iske 'jai he' mujeim kaa shrey ve is hawaii adde kaa vikaas or sanchaalan karne vaali company jivike ke chairman ji
 V
 ke
 Let's give it to Reddy
 kalatmak logon ke bare main yah kahana ghisi-pity baat hogi ki ve tamagon main bharosa nahin karte or unhen dibbon main band hona pasand nahin he
 But a sad irony of Sethi's departure from the headquarters of South Extension is that things of art and literature have to be sealed in boxes
 sethi naaj se khud ko harfanmaulaa kehete hai, ek aisa curator, jise paaramparik hindustani dastakaari kii khud ko badalane or dhaalane kii kshamta par hameshaa bharosa rahaa he
 His old office has a screen with some Gond art on it, which is animated and is an attempt to create original narratives for international audiences
 jab sethi ritair honge—ve apane sansmaran likhane kaa mansuba to pehle se bana hi rahe hai—tab unke ullas or hindustani rachanashiltaa main unke khalis bharose kii kami hamen bahut khalegi
 Rajiv Sethi's success in Kalayapalat of Mumbai Airport's T2 is a big success
 vah sethi ke kalatmak nazariye kii behtareen misaal he
 *** bispi supremeo mayawati ne ravivaar ko saharanpur raily se upi main chunavi abhiyaan kaa aagaaj kiya to siyaasi pandit hairaan rah gaye
 The reason was the tremendous activation of Bahujan Samaj Party and its supporters on social media
 hairaani isliye ki jis party ne kabhi yah kahkar soshal media ke jariye prachaar karne se inkaar kar diya tha ki wo jameen se judi party he or use jameen par rahakar hi kaam karnaa he, duusari partiyon kii tarah hallaa machaakar nahin
 But during the Saharanpur rally, not only the BSP and its supporters were active on social media, but their strategy was also successful
 mayawati kii raily ke vakt # mayawatinextupcm twitor par trending topic rahaa
 The Bahujan Samaj Party, which is pushing for a heel injury to return to power in UP, may have realized that in today's era, the importance of social media to connect more and more people, especially youth, cannot be ignored
 bispi ne agle saal hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav ke liye baqayada twitor handle @bspup2017 bhi banaaya he
 # mayawatinextupcm and # chalosaharanpur trends were conducted through this Twitter handle during Mayawati's rally
 raily kaa live telecast link muhaiyaa karaayaa gaya
 It was ensured that the tweets to be handled by the bsp's official Twitter re-tweet party activists and supporters
 soshal media par active hue kaaryakrtanai peedi ke liye bispi kii nai ranneeti kaa asar bhi dikhaa
 # mayawatinextupcm was the top trending topic on Twitter in India while ranked sixth in the world
 chunki party kii taraf se is tarah kaa yah pehla prayog tha, isliye live strimming ke dauraan kuch takneekee dikkatein bhi ain
 Party sources say that as elections are approaching, activists have been asked to stay active on social media and this is the best way to stay connected with people 24x7

 2011 main arab spring ke dauraan usne apane 30 doston ke saath ek cycle raily nikaali or naaraa lagaaya, "hamen maanavadhikaar chahie
 "the Saudi government became restless after hearing the protesting voice of a 10-year-old child
 saudi sarkaar ke karinde uskaa peechha karne lage
 Murtaza had participated in several such dharna demonstrations during the Arab Spring

 sabase chota raajnneetik bandi kaha gayouse vakt vakeelon, activist ne use duniya kaa sabase chota raajnneetik bandi bataaya tha
 After being imprisoned for more than four years, Murtaza is now 18 years old and is now facing the threat of capital punishment
 murtaja par aarope he ki saudi arab ke dakshini shahar awamiya main apane bhai ke saath ek police stesan gaya or vahaan par petrol bam phenkaa
 According to a CNN report, his case is going on in a Terror Court
 sarkari paksh ne kaha he ki murtaja kaa taalluk ek 'ugravadi aatanki samooh' se he
 In addition, Murtaza is accused of making Molotov cocktails (petrol bombs), firing at security personnel
 saudi arab ke kanoon ke mutabik in kathith aparaadhon ke liye maut kii sajaa di jaati he

 bataa den ki sarkaar virdohi pradarshnon main murtaja kaa bhai bhi maaraa gaya he tab murtaja kii umr maatr 11 saal thi
 Amnesty International came into protest Amnesty International, a worldwide human rights organization, has opposed any such attempt by the Saudi government
 emnesti ne kaha ki antarrashtriya kanoon 18 saal se kam umr ke doshiyon ke liye kisi bhi aparaadh main maut kii sajaa ko pratibandhit karata he

 ek ore udati saadiyaan or gaadiyaan hai to duusari ore camere or cinema kii samaj kaa kamaal
 On one side there is a gathering of many artists, on the other side there is a love triangle of three stars
 ek ore hit film mashin he to duusari ore bhavyata kaa maahir khilaadi
 On December 18, something similar is going to be seen at the box office
 pehle baat karte hai rohit shetty kii
 Those who have a record of hit films, but it is also a matter of fact that the earnings are increasing with each of their films, but the story is getting weaker
 beshak jab tak kamai ho sab acha he
 The trailer of 'dilwale' has been released
 is trailor main koi cheez dekhne laayak he to vah shahrukh khan hai
 Watching the full trailer, it is seen as a glimpse of Rohit's old films
 dekhen, shahrukh-kaajol kii film 'dilavaale' kaa trailarshahrukh ke dialog achche hai, jitna kaajol ko dikhaaya he vah bhi thik he
 But after that the same Rohit Shetty style masala makes his film quite obvius
 dher saare actor
 By the way, it is always fun to see Shahrukh alone, not in the crowd of stars
 zyada kapadon main bhi he sex apiub baat sanjay lila bhansaali kii karen to ve apane manamafik filmein banaate hai
 His films have a depth and often have a love triangle in their story
 'bajirao mastaani' main bhi aisa hi he
 While the trailer of the film tries to show a lot of diversity, Sanjay Leela's grandeur is visible
 dekhen, ranvir-deepika kii 'bajirao mastaani' kaa tijersatha hi ranvir singh kaa bataur actor ek nae paaydaan par chadhana bhibollywood kii nai peedike maior hone kii ore ishaara karata he
 Then how the heroine is shown sexy by wearing more and more clothes, this skill is also only with Sanjay Leela Bhansali, and its example is Deepika Padukone
 kul milakar donon hi filmein logon ko apni ore khinchne ke liye ji-jaan lagaae hue hai
 So far, whatever spice has come from both films, 'bajirao Mastani' has been nineteen, while Rohit's 'dilwale' has been seen running on the old track

 Video-prime time: new insurance, pension schemes of the government will be effective? lambii khinchataan or rajd supremeo lalu prasad ke congress ko ek or seat die jane ke saath hi rajd, congress or rakanpa ke bich loksabhaa chunaav main gairsampradayik gathbandhan banane ko lekar buudhvaar ko aam sahmati ban gai
 In the presence of NCP state spokesperson Anil Kumar Jha during the joint press conference held at the residence of former Patna Chief Minister Rabri Devi today, the RJD and NCP of his party in Bihar to counter the communal powers of Congress state president Ashok Chaudhary After announcing to contest 2014 Lok Sabha elections together with RJD supremo Lalu Prasad spoke Or that Congress will contest 12 and NCP in one seat and RJD will contest the remaining 27 seats
 lalu ne bataaya ki aapasi talmail ke tahat congress jin 12 siton par chunaav ladegi unamem sasaram (surakshit), kishanganj, aurangabad, supaul, hajipur (surakshit), purniya, patna sahib, nalanda, samastipur (surakshit), valmikinagar, gopalganj (surakshit), mujffarpur tathaa ek seat katihaar par rakanpa chunaav ladegi tathaa baaki 27 siton par rajd apane ummidavaar khadaa karegi
 He said that in the 27 seats on which RJD will contest elections in coordination with Congress and NCP, West Champaran East Champaran Shivhar Sitamadhi Madhubani, Jhanjharpur Araria Madhepura Darbhanga Vaishali Siwan Maharajganj Saran Ujjiyarpur, Begusarai Khagadia Bhagalpur Banka Munger Pataliputra Ara Baksar Kaara Baksar Jaya ) Includes Nawada and Jamui (safe)
 congress, rajd or rakanpa ke bich gathbandhan kii yah ghoshnaa congress or rajd ke bich gathbandhan tathaa siton ke bantwaare ko lekar lambii khinchataan tathaa unke ek anya sahyogi purv kendriya mantri ramvilas paswan kii party lojpa ke rajg kii ore khisak jane tathaa loksabhaa chunaav kii ghoshnaa ho jane ke baad antim rup le paaya
 It is noteworthy that in the last Lok Sabha elections, RJD and LJP fought together in Bihar, while Congress fought on its own
 lalu ne gathbandhan ke liye tathaa sampradayik takaton ko rokane ke liye ekajute hokar chunaav ladane ke liye congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi or party ke sabhi anya rashtriya netaaon ke prati aabhaar vyakt kiya
 He said that today the biggest threat to the country is of communalism and communal forces want to destroy unity and integrity and put the country on the verge of partition
 isliye ve sabhi dharmanirpeksh dalon se desh ko bachaane ke liye ekajute hone kii apil karte rahe hai
 Lalu said that while accusing bjp's prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi of being an ally of communalism, Modi knew the country and the world and as of now, the US has not given him a visa to visit
 lalu ne aarope lagaaya ki aresas or bhaajapa babari masjid ke vidhwans baad ab apane gupt agendon ko lagu karne manshaa rakhti he
 Therefore, it is necessary for us (secular powers) to gather
 lalu ne pichhlaa loksabhaa chunaav or bihar vidhansabha chunaav congress ke saath milakar nahin ladne ko apni bhul bataate hue kaha ki is baar congress, rajd or rakanpa ne kaaphi koshish karke aapasi talmail ke saath bihar main chunaav ladane kaa nirnay liya he or anya chote dal jo bhi unke saath aana chahenge unka swaagat he
 After this alliance between the Congress, RJD and NCP, Lalu ruled out a friendly fight between these parties on any parliamentary seat
 bihar main mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ko koi factor nahin bataate hue lalu ne daawa ki narendra modi, nitish kumaar ke mitra hai kyonki modi ne kal mujffarpur kii raily main apane bhaashan main spasht kar diya he ki nitish unase kamare ke bheetar saath milte the, par baahar main unke saath haath milaane se darate the
 Lalu denied any danger to himself when his old ally LJP left the BJP
 isse pehle lalu ne congress or rakanpa ke kramash: 11 or 1 seat kaa prastaav diya tha
 Earlier, Bihar Pradesh Congress President Ashok Chaudhary said that the Congress always has an ideology to weaken communal powers in Bihar
 isliye 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main unki party ne nirnay liya he ki abhi kaa jo samay he usamen rajd ke saath gathbandhan karke is chunavi samar main sampradayik shaktiyon kaa munhatod jawaab den
 Regarding which national leaders of the Congress will come for campaigning in Bihar, the party's state president Ashok Chaudhary said that after Holi, the national vice president of Congress, Rahul Gandhi will visit Bihar
 congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ke rajd supremeo lalu prasad ke saath bihar main saath prachaar kiye jane ke bare main puche jane par ashok choudhary ne kaha ki samay aayega to jarur hoga
 Lalu Prasad, who was sentenced in the fodder scam case, ended his Lok Sabha membership after the withdrawal of the ordinance by the Union Cabinet for the relief of Rahul's convicted public representatives after the ordinance was torn down and now Lalu is no longer in the current Lok Sabha elections Will be able to fight
 congress ke varisht netaa or purv kendriya mantri shakeel ahamed jinke madhubani se chunaav ladne kii charchaa ke kaaran in donon dalon ke bich ab tak gathbandhan nahin ho paane kii baat kahi ja rahi thi, iske bare main puche jane par choudhary ne kaha ki saansad banane se adhik mahatvapurn party or sanghathan ko pradesh main majboot karnaa he

 pichley dinon mumbai main sansani si much gai
 The son of the MP from Amroha in Uttar Pradesh filed a complaint directly with the Police Commissioner Rakesh Maria against an escort service
 kaha ki ek ladki or uske dryver ne unhen or unke enarai dost ko lut liya
 The incident was described as night
 police kamishnar ko sidhe saansad ke bete ne sandesh bheja tha to karrwai to honi hi thi
 Escort service means such mysterious service which is neither legal nor falls under the category of illegal business
 is seva ko dene waalon kaa daawa he ki mahilaayein escort karne ke liye bulaai ja sakati he
 In Mumbai, this service operates indiscriminately
 vigyaapan khub aate hai
 Must also remain in the eyes of police
 paanch sitara hotel main tehre saansad sahab ke bete ko is sarvice kii jarurat mumbai ke pub or baar main jane ke liye mahasoos hui
 Police arrested two agents in a hurry after this complaint, but the case was high profile, so all the officers are silent
 is ghatana kaa byoraa or paristhitiyaan bataanaa isliye jaruri ho gaya tha, kyonki hoicourt ne guuruuvaar ko ek janhit yachika kii sunwaayee kii
 The hearing was linked to the police raid that took place on Marh Island
 yachikakarta kaa kahana tha ki police ne hotel main jaakar premi jodon ko jabardastee baahar nikaala
 Despite all the identities and evidence the hotel has, charges have been leveled against obscene couples for spreading obscenity
 ye masalaa soshal network par khub jorshor se uthaa
 After that, the PIL reached the High Court, on which notices have been issued to the Home Minister and the Commissioner of Police
 mumbai kii chhapemar police ab kah rahi he ki jin logon ko police ne us din pakadaa tha un sabake galat pate the, isliye police ke khilaaf koi shikaayat darj nahin karvaa rahaa
 Now, who has barely been left out of the clutches of this police, how can he muster up the courage of the same mind again
 vaise police bhi shaayad andarkhaane yahi chaahati thi
 There will be neither complainant, nor any policeman will stand in the dock
 mumbai kii chhapemar police ke charitra ko in donon alag alag ghatnaon se samajha ja saktaa he
 In one incident, he knows what an escort service is, how it works, advertisements are published every day
 
 
 yahaan tak ki use graahak bhi maaloom hai
 All these details are available with the police in the big hotels where the customers stay
 lekin vah ection lene kaa jokhim nahin uthaa sakati
 If a customer complains of fraud with him, he takes immediate action
 duusari ghatana main, madh ke jin hotalon main vah red karne pahunchi thi, use vahaan bhi maaloom tha ki bajet hotalon main thaharne vaale koun log hai
 The city where the whole family barely sleeps in a quarter to two hundred square feet, needs those budget hotels on a holiday, this is the reality of Mumbai and the police have known this for a long time
 tippaniyan In 'hafta Sanskriti', the hotel owners also do not hide the truth from the police, the beat marshal who comes round every day knows who is a lover couple and who is not
 
 
 yaa koun suraksha ke liye khatra ho saktaa he
 These two incidents are enough to tell that the police knows everything, just want to see the action where the lover belongs to the weaker section, where he is not in danger of getting screwed by a big man

 Why NYAY is still needed According to the research cell of the Congress, 70 percent of the people in the country were poor at the time of independence
 lekin congress sarkarein kaaphi mehnat kar ise 20 fisadi tak lekar ai hai
 Now the time has come to take the final blow on poverty
 congress kaa lakshya 20 fisadi garibi ko hataakar shunya tak laana or desh se garibi ko puri tarah se khatm karnaa he
 This scheme will provide economic justice and give the poor a chance to live with dignity and respect
 garibon ke haath main paisa jane se upbhog badhegaa or isse rojgaar badhegaa, kar rajasav bhi badhegaa
 Income inequality in the country is increasing rapidly
 duniya kii teesri sabase badi arthvyavastha hone ke naate yah ham sab kaa naitik daayitv he ki desh se garibi ko puri tarah se khatm karne kaa mahatvakankshi kaam haath main len
 The Congress wants to completely eradicate poverty from the country by 2030
 3
 Who will get the benefit of NYAY? The scheme aims to have 5 crore poorest families who constitute 20% of the population
 paisa sidhe parivaar kii mahila ke khate main jayega
 If he does not have a bank account, it will be opened
 4
 How much will the burden on the treasury The estimated cost of this scheme will be 1 per cent of GDP in the first year (at current prices) and up to 2 per cent of GDP in the second year
 yojana puri tarah se lagu hone par is par kareeb 3
 It will cost 6 lakh crore rupees
 aage chalakar is yojana kaa kharch ghatakar jidipi ke 1
 2 to 1 5 fisadi rah jayega, kyonki tab garibon kii sankhya ghat jaaegi
 The Congress believes that this will not be a big task given the size of the country's GDP of 200 lakh crores and the annual expenditure of 60 lakh crores of the central and state governments
 is prakaar nyaay par centre rajya sarkaron ke kul kharch kaa mahaj 5 fisadi hissaa kharch hoga or desh se garibi khatm karne jaise lakshya ke liye yah zyada nahin kaha ja saktaa
 5
 congress sarkaar kahaan se karegi iske liye dhan kii vyavasthaayojna ko lagu karne ke liye congress vittiya anushaasan or vivekpurna kharch kaa tarika apnayegi
 It will be implemented as a joint scheme of the central and state governments
 lekin laagat kaa mukhyat: centre sarkaar vahan karegi
 The scheme will be implemented by raising new sources of revenue and rationalizing the existing expenditure
 research cell ne kaha ki jab congress ne manaregaa lagu kiya tha, tab bhi bijepi or vipaksh ise bahut mahatvakankshi or kharchila bataa rahe the
 0 of GDP spent on it in the early stages of MNREGA
 6 fisadi tak tha jo baad main ghatakar 0
 Stayed at 3 percent
 bijepi agar bullate train ke liye 1 lakh karod rupee kii vyavastha kar sakati he to aarthik nyaay ke liye congress itani rakam kii vyavastha kar sakati he
 6
 kya anya yojanaon kii sabsidi band ho jaegimaujuuda yojanaon kii sabsidi jari rahegi or unase koi chhedchhad nahin kiya jayega
 The existing 11 main subsidy schemes for the poor will not be withdrawn
 isaki jagah rajasav badhaane kii koshish kii jaaegi
 There are more sources besides tax to increase revenue
 7
 How will the beneficiaries be identified? With the data available today, poor families can be easily identified
 saal 2011 kaa saamaajik-aarthik jati janaganana or parivaar ke aankade se madad mil sakati he
 This data was also used to identify the beneficiaries for the PM Awas Yojana
 antyoday ann yojana, ayushmaan bharat, ujjwala, piem awaas yojana, piem kisaan yojana jaisi skiimon se sambandhit data mil jayega
 8
 kaise lagu hogi yojanayah yojana kai charnon main lagu hogi
 The MNREGA scheme was implemented in several phases
 congress arthshaastriyon, samajashastriyon or sankhyakividon kii ek samiti banaaegi jo is yojana kii dizin, shuru karne or ise lagu karne kaa puraa kaam dekhenge
 Its next phase will be implemented only after the committee has indicated that everything is going well
 9
 On whose advice, the plan Congress has consulted many economists and experts from this country and abroad
 udhaaharan ke liye prakhyat global iconomist raghuram rajan, thomas picketti or abhijit bannerjee ne saarvajanik rup se yah sweekaar kiya he ki unase is yojana ke bare main salaah lee gai he
 For this, extensive economic discussions have been held
 desh bhar ke pariwaron ke aay vitaran aankadon, pariwaron ke khapat pravriti, vaishvik survey or rajya sarkaron tathaa nijee kshetra ke bhi aankadon kaa adhyayan kiya gaya
 10
 kya yah top-ap skim hanheen, pehle media main is tarah kii khabaren ai thim ki yah top-ap skim hogi or congress sarkaar yah sunishchit karegi ki har parivaar ko 12,000 rupee maheene tak aay ho sake
 But the Congress Research Cell has said that 6,000 months will be given per family under this scheme
 yah saal main 72,000 rupee hote hai
 It will be a full cash transfer
