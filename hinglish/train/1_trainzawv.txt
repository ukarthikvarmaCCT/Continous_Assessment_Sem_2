 Union Minister Piyush Goyal has launched a major attack on the Congress
 mumbai hamalon ko zikr karte hue piyush goyal ne kaha ki congress ne mumbai hamale ke gunahagaaron ke khilaaf koi karrwai nahin kii
 Rather, the then Chief Minister of the Congress, the late Vilasrao Deshmukh, was more concerned about getting his son to play a role in the film
 piyush goyal ne kaha ki jab 26 / 11 ko mumbai hamalaa ko congress kii sarkaar kamjor thi or usne koi karrwai nahin kii
 While the then Maharashtra Congress CM Divgant Vilasrao Deshmukh reached outside the Oberoi Hotel along with the filmmaker, when the hotel was firing and blasts
 congressi siem ko apane bete ke filmi kariyar kii zyada phikr thi
 Accusing the Congress, Piyush Goyal said that our armed forces were still capable, but the decision had to be taken by the leadership
 suraksha bal yah ummid karte rahe ki unhen munhtod jawaab diya jayega, lekin unhen karrwai karne kii anumati nahin di gai
 It was a cowardly government
 p Goyal: I'm from Mumbai,you might remember the 26 / 11 terror attack
 The then Congress govt was weak & couldn't do anything
 The then CM had brought a film producer outside Oberoi Hotel while shooting&bombing was going on inside
 CM was concerned about getting his child a film rolepic

 media reports ke anusaar, hamale ke baad 30 disambar ko vilasarav deshmukh, apane actor bete ritesh deshmukh or film nirmaataa ram gopal verma ke saath taj hotel gaye the
 There was speculation that Ram Gopal Varma would make a film on it
 haalanki, unhone isse inkaar kar diya tha
 At the same time, Vilasrao Deshmukh also refused to investigate in connection with any film project

 In the last three years, terrorists have carried out six attacks on military bases in Pakistan and most importantly and overwhelmingly have entered the fortified bases with little resistance

 Such audacious attacks have not only questioned the ability of the powerful armed forces to defend themselves, but have put more than 100 nuclear weapons, making Pakistan the world's fourth-largest nuclear power, ahead of France and Britain
 Security (india has some 80 nuclear weapons) has also raised questions

 "although Pakistan has done a lot to deal with terrorists, the threat to its stockpile is still considerable," says Christopher Clary, visiting fellow at the Defense Studies and Analysis Institute, Delhi
 ''punjab ke rajyapal salmaan taasir kii hatya unheen ke angrakshak dwaara kar die jane jaisi haal kii ghatnaon ne parmaanu hathiyaaron kii suraksha main tainaat karmiyon ke apane itihaas ko lekar ashanka paidaa kar di he
 There are fears that home piercing in Pakistani nuclear installations may be seriously damaging for weapons

 Another possible use of fissile material is to create a 'simple explosive system'

 The Pakistan government calls such apprehensions about its nuclear stockpiles "fear-mongering"

 The Pakistani Foreign Ministry says, "we realize to avoid getting into an arms race with India, but we will not compromise with our national security
" pakistan dakshin asia main shanti suraksha or sthirataa ko mahatv detaa he or parmaanu aprasar ke maamle ke saakshyon main 'chuninda dhang' or 'apwaad' ke dushprabhavon ke prati sajag he

 According to reports, Pakistan is not only indiscriminately making bomb bombs, but also producing fissile material from two different production sources

 The opposition team was waiting for the game to end, Pranav had broken the record of 117 years on the very first day by not being out for 652, the students of his opposition team (arya Gurukul) were exhausted and waiting for the game to end
 lekin kasee gandhi hai skool ke coach ne match ko chalate rahane diya
 Arya Gurukul's team was reduced to just 32 runs in the first innings, yet KC Gandhi High School scored 1465 runs in return, which was not needed
 vipakshi team ne majaburi main khelaa machaarya gurukul ke coach yogesh jagataap ne bataaya ki unke paas under-16 match khilne ke liye 12 saal ke khilaadiyon kii team thi

 The question simply arises as to what purpose is served by such a large score

 Such children are also necessary but in zonal matches
 skool or club cricket main aise kuch niyam banaae jane chahie jisase sabhi ke liye khilne kaa samay nirdhaarit ho
 Showcasing talent to all, Dravid said in a lecture at the MAK Pataudi Memorial that when 11 players are selected for the field, they are followed by 4 children who are sitting
 ve puraa din skool se chuttee lete hai or unke paas karne ke liye kuch nahin hota he
 Pranav Dhanavade's 1009 runs could not give other students a chance to show their talent

 If Azam Khan made a derogatory remark about Jayaprada, the Election Commission has imposed all kinds of restrictions on his election campaign for 72 hours
 haalanki rampur ke siyaasi or jaateey sameekaran aise hai jisamen ajam khan ko maat dena jayaprada ke liye aasaan nahin balki lohe ke chane chabane jaisaa he
 Azam Khan has entered the Lok Sabha elections for the first time in Rampur politics
 ajam ko takkar dene ke liye is seat se do baar saansad raheen film abhinetri jayaprada bijepi pratyaashee ke taur par maidan main hai
 At the same time, the Congress has fielded the party's national secretary and former MLA Sanjay Kapoor
 1967 ke baad rampur main pehali baar he jab congress ne rampur ke 'nawab parivaar' se baahar ke kisi shaks ko pratyaashee banaaya he
 Such is the Rampur Lok Sabha seat of Uttar Pradesh, where Muslim voters are more than Hindus
 2011 kii janaganana ke mutabik rampur main 51 fisadi muslim aabaadi he
 bjp's Nepal Singh was successful in winning the 2014 Lok Sabha elections when Congress fielded Nawab Kazim Ali Khan, SP Nasser Ahmed Khan and BSP fielded Akbar Hussain
 teenon partiyon se muslim ummidavaar ke chalate muslim voton ke bikharaav kaa phayda bijepi pratyaashee ko mila tha
 Despite this, the SP candidate lost by just 23 thousand votes
 rampur seat par nawab parivaar kaa dabadabaa saalon se rahaa he
 The Congress has so far given tickets to a member of the Nawab family in almost every election
 yah pehali baar he ki rampur ke is rasukhwale parivaar se kisi ko tikat na dekar congress ne sanjay kapur par daanv khelaa he
 In such a situation, Azam Khan is the only Muslim candidate to see the candidates of major political parties
 aise main ajam khan ko basapa or areldi kaa samarthan hasil he
 In such a situation, whatever polarization will happen in the politics of Rampur, Azam Khan can get its direct benefit
 haalanki jayaprada 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav main ajam khan ke virodh karne ke baavjood jeet darj kii thi
 In the same way, Azam Khan made false statements to Jayaprada even 10 years ago
 us samay jaya pradaa ne ajam khan ke bayaan ko lekar manch se royee thi
 He got a political advantage from this
 sapa se hone ke chalate muslim matadaataaon ne ajam khan ke mukhaalafat ke baavjood vot diya tha
 But the political equations have changed a lot this time
 jayaprada sapa ke bajaay bijepi se ummidavaar ke taur par maidan main he
 Not only this, there is no candidate from Rampur Nawab family
 aise main ajam khan ke liye puraa siyaasi maidan khaali najar aa rahaa he
 Considered the Muslim face of SP, Azam Khan has been a 9-time MLA from Rampur assembly seat
 itnaa hi nahin rampur kii paanch vidhansabha siton main se teen par sapa kaa kabja he
 Apart from this, the politics of Nawab Khan of Rampur is marginalized these days
 rampur ke siyaasi vaaris nawab kazim ali ko ajam khan ke bete record maton se maat dekar vidhayak chune gaye hai
 After this, there is no other option available to the Muslims due to none of the Nawab's family entering the Lok Sabha elections
 haalanki nawab parivaar kaa congress pratyaashee sanjay kapur ko he, lekin maujuuda halaat main muslim matadaataaon kaa bada tabaka gathbandhan ke saath najar aa rahaa he
 In the 16 Lok Sabha elections held since 1957 till now, the Congress fielded the people of Nawab family from Rampur Lok Sabha seat
 jisamen is kunbe ne 9 baar loksabhaa chunaavon main jeet darj kii he
 Zulfiqar Ali Khan alias Mikki Mian was a five-time MP, while his wife Noor Ban also reached the Lok Sabha after winning the 1996 and 1999 Lok Sabha elections
 ajam khan ne apni siyaasi lakeer nawab parivaar ke khilaaf khadey hokar khinchi he
 In 2004, Jaya Prada contested the election of Jaya Prada to Parliament to defeat the Nawab family from the politics of Rampur
 lekin jayaprada ne ajam khan or amar singh ke raajnneetik varchasv kii ladaai main amar singh ke saath khadi najar ain
 From here, the feud increased so much that it was seen up to the road
 ajam khan khule taur par jaya pradaa ke liye bayaanbaji karte aa rahe hai
 However, this time both of them are in direct competition

 In the role of Kingmaker, Jannayak Janata Party leader Dushyant Chautaladushyant Chautala will meet in Delhi on Friday on the strategy of the party, where there were armaments of the 75-odd Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Haryana for the last time, so where can you even raise the numbers to form the government Has arrived
 bijepi abhi bhi haryana kii number 1 party he lekin kingmekar ke role main jananaayak janata party (jejepi) ke netadushyant chautala gaye hai
 According to sources, the Congress is ready to give Dushyant Chautala the post of deputy CM, but he is not ready to open the cards
 haryana ke nattejey or rujhaan bataa rahe hai kicongressunaav se pehle bhitarghaat se na juujhi hoti to sameekaran kuch or bhi ho sakate the
 However, Congress is not giving up in the contest right now
 purv mukhyamantri bhupendra singh hooda ne apil kii he ki sabhi bijepi virdohi ek saath aaen or sarkaar banaaen
 However, he did not announce anything about the post of Chief Minister
 bataa den, haryana main trishankuvidhansabhake asaar najar aa rahe hai
 JJP leader Dushyant Singh Chautala said that he has called a meeting of the party executive at 11 am on Friday in Delhi to discuss the party's strategy
 unki tippaniyon ke bich yah khabar ai he ki vah chunaav ke baad hone vaale kisi bhi samjhaute ke liye shart ke taur par mukhyamantri pad ke liye jor de rahe hai
 No party is in a position to cross the magic figure of a majority in the 90-member Haryana Assembly
 bijepi 40, congress 31 or anya dal 19 siten jitate dikh rahe hai
 BJP has won 37 seats, while it is leading in three seats
 haryana main kaise banegi sarkaar or kya ho sakate hai sameekaran, aaie jaanate hai
 1-BJP and independents BJP has won 40 seats
 bahumat ke liye use 6 siten or chahie kyonki 90 sadasyeey haryana vidhansabha main bahumat kaa jaadui aankada 46 kaa he
 Independent candidates can give 6 seats to the BJP
 ye vahi ummidavaar hai, jo bijepi se tikat nahin milane par baagi banakar chunaav lade or jeet hasil kii
 It is now believed that they should be reconciled with their parent party and make Manohar Lal Khattar the Chief Minister again by giving his support
 bijepi inhen bada pad ofer kar sakati he kyonki khatter sarkaar ke bade-bade mantri haar kaa munh dekhakar maidan se baahar ho chuke hai
 So independents can be given a bigger roll
 2-congress-jejepi-anya kaa gathjodacongress ke paas 31 or jejepi ke paas 10 siten hai
 Therefore, if the congress-jjp and other government organizations want to form a government, then it will need 6 more seats
 ye siten anya dalon se aaengi
 But the problem is that among the other candidates, there are 6 BJP rebels, who are finding it difficult to enter the Congress camp at the moment
 anya main 6 ke alaava bache chaar congress ko samarthan dekar sarkaar nahin banavaa sakate
 In this case, a coalition government can be formed only when 6 mlas of other parties shift to Congress and together with JJP form the government of Bhupendra Hooda
 aisa hone kii gunjaaish kam he kyonki jejepi bina shart kisi ko samarthan dene ko raji nahin
 3-dushyant Chautala's support to BJP: There is also a situation that Dushyant Choutalakhud himself comes forward and agrees to support BJP
 sutron ke hawaale se aisi khabar he ki chautaala ne bijepi ko samarthan dene kii baat kahi he
 The problem will be that the BJP cannot give the Chief Minister's post to Dushyant Chautala as the difference of seats in the two parties is very large
 haalanki bijepi chautaala ko dipti siem bana kar or nirdaleeyon kaa samarthan lekar haryana main maje sesarkarbana sakati he
 In such a Surat, Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattaronghe and Chautala Deputy CM
 samarthan dene vaale nirdaleey netaa malaaidaar mantri pad paakar bijepi kii gaadi aage khinch sakate hai
 4 - Karnataka Formula may also apply in Haryana to Karnataka Formula
 karnataka main congress ke paas zyada siten hote hue bhi usne jedies netaa echdikumaraswamiko mukhyamantri banaaya tha
 There were also situations like Haryana, because no party had a majority
 lekin congress ne gaiyr-bijepi sarkaar banane kaa aahvaan karte hue siem kursi kii qurbaani di or kumaraswami ko mukhyamantri banaaya
 It is a different matter that the government was in a shambles from the beginning and eventually collapsed
 congress chaahe to aisa formula haryana main lagu kar jejepi kaa samarthan le sakati he
 Dushyant Chautala should be given the chief minister's post and support of independents including INLD
 haalanki isamen bhi un 6 nirdaleeyon kaa maamla funs saktaa he jo bijepi ke baagi hai
 The arithmetic of the data suggests that Dushyant Chautala is no less independent than he is important to form the government because without him no one can be formed

 Let me tell you that this film has broken the record of Kesari and Jolly LLB 2 by Akshay Kumar

 It has mission director Rakesh Dhawan (akshay Kumar) and project director Tara Shinde (vidya Balan)

 Meaning if the whereabouts of jaish-e-mohammed in Balkot are to be targeted, then there is no need to enter the border of Pakistan
 india today group si voter ke taaja survey se ek baat saamne ai he ki 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke baad kshetreey dalon kii bhoomika behad mahatvapurn hogi or sarkaar banane main unka sahyog jaruri hoga
 For the past several years, we are seeing coalition governments being formed at the center
 inamen kshetreey dalon ne apni suvidha se apane partner kaa chunaav kiya or satta yaa vipaksh main rahane kaa faisla kiya
 However, he kept using a common word for this which is communalism
 inkaa virodh karne kii baat kahkar vah amuman congress kii ore jhuk jate hai
 But when coalition governments are formed, the main party has to be under pressure from regional parties and their conditions are there
 ve apni sharton par kaam karte hai jiske dushprinaam pramukh dal hi nahin desh ko bhi jhelane padate hai
 We have been watching and experiencing this for quite some time
 chaahe vah annadramuk ho yaa dramuk yaa phir trinmul congress athwa ensipi sabhi ne jahaan tak ho sakaa apni sharten khub manavaayee
 Not only did he openly demand creamy ministries, but he also indulged in corruption and even threatened to topple the government on questioning
 beshak hamaara loktantr paripakv hota dikh rahaa he or iskaa udhaaharan saajha sarkaron kaa bananaa bhi he, lekin kshetreey dalon tathaa unke aakaaon kaa vyavhaar aisa katai nahin he
 In fact, for these satraps, the party is like a zamindari where everything is own and principles are laid down
 unke liye vyaktigat hit or thodaa bahut rajya ke hit hi mahatvapurn hote hai
 In this process, they leave behind the interests of the country, like DMK in Sri Lanka or Trinamool in Bangladesh
 in partiyon ne apane tuchh swaarthon ke kaaran desh ke liye kuch jaruri nitiyon ko lagu hone nahin diya
 Regional parties made alliances at their own convenience and broke, the principles were in vain
 lekin isamen pramukh dalon kii bhi galati rahi
 In the greed to gain power, he also immediately made compromises, without seeing what the consequences would be
 ve kai baar blakemeling ke aage jhuk bhi gaye or unki sharton par kaam bhi kiya
 If the major parties do not bow down to the regional parties, then it does not necessarily make their government fall as we saw during the tenure of UPA-2
 congress ne trinmul or dramuk kii bahut si baton ke aage jhukne se inkaar kar diya
 But this was when a lot of spectacle had taken place
 baharhaal yah tay he ki agali sarkaar bhi in kshatrapon ke sahyog se banegi or ve apni sharton par kisi bhi gathbandhan main aaenge
 It will be bad for the country, very bad

 He said that according to TRAI data, in June 2014, a consumer was using only 70 mega bytes of data in a month which increased to 1600 MB in September 2017
 internet istemaal karne vaale graahakon kii sankhya bhi in 3 saalon main 259 million se badhkar 429 million ho gai
 Ravi Shankar Prasad also informed the Parliament that digital transactions in the country are also growing at a very fast pace
 disambar 2015 main sirf 61 karod rupye kaa len-dein digital tranjaction ke jariye hua tha, jo ki oktober 2017 main badhkar 153 karod tak pahunch chukaa he
 Ravi Shankar Prasad said that the government is taking several steps to take internet access from village to village
 pichley mahineniti ayogke siio amitabh kaant ne bataaya tha ki 150 karod jibi pratimah mobile data upbhog ke saath hi bharat data upbhog karne ke maamle main top par pahunch gaya he

 Pay attention to why the counting of votes takes place only a few days after the vote
 Because this is the time when people shouting sloganeering slogans in the tonsil-like voice, from leaflets on the walls to the tamuk, pamphlets all over the carriage, and the night-and-night mouths of the dark-skinned people give their accounts - They are doing books

 ) Broke isro's connection to Vikram Lander
 Attempts to establish contact with Vikram Lander: Scientists of ISRO are now investigating where, how and why the disturbances occurred in Vikram Lander's landings
 For this, ISRO scientists have started digging long and wide data
 isro ke vaigyanik is sawaal kaa jawaab talashne ke liye vikram lander ke telemetric data, signal, software, hardware, liquid ingine kaa vistaarpurvak adhyayan kar rahe hai
 The last 20 minutes of Datavikram's landing were messed up in the last moments
 ye dikkat tab shuru hui jab vikram lander chand kii sataha se maatr 2
 Was 1 kilometer up
 ab vaigyanik vikram lander ke utarane ke raste (telemetric data of descent trajectory) kaa vishleshan kar rahe hai
 According to the report, there may be some secret hidden in the performance data of every sub-system
 yahaan liquid ingine kaa zikr behad ahm he
 This has been an important role in the landing of Vikram Lander
 lander se mili aakhri signlavaigyanik un signal yaa utsarjan sanketon kii jaanch kar rahe hai jisase kuch gadabadi kaa pataa chale
 This may include software problems, hardware malfunctions
 isamen aakhri ke 2
 1 kilometer figures are more important
 sensor se downlod hua datavikram lander jab chand kii sataha par utarane kii koshish kar rahaa tha to uske sensor ne kai data cmand centre ko bheje hai
 These include many other data including a picture of the moon's surface
 is par isro kii team kaam kar rahi he
 Attempting to make contact: Scientists of ISRO are constantly trying to establish that the lander can be contacted
 vaigyanikon kaa maananaa he ki agar vikram ne krash land kiya he to uske upkarnon ko nuksaan pahunchaa hua hoga, lekin agar orbitor ke jariye sahi disha main lander se sampark karne kii koshish kii jaae to sampark sthapit ho saktaa he
 The mapping orbiter of the landing area has devices that have the ability to measure the surface of the moon, take photographs
 agar orbitor aisi koi bhi tasviir bhejtaa he to lander ke bare main jaankaree mil sakati he
 Internal defaults or external elements ISRO Vikram is examining every aspect to find a flaw in the landing of the lander
 isro kii team ab ye jaanch kar rahi he ki kya kisi kism kii aantarik chook hui he yaa phir koi bahari tatv kaa haath he
 Help from other agencies The world space agencies were eyeing the landing of Chandrayaan-2
 isliye isro is par bhi vichaar kar saktaa he ki duusari agenciyon, jaise ki spes stesan, telescope se vikram lander se jude jaruri sensor data ko liya jaae, taaki vikram lander kaa lokation pataa chal sake
 ISRO is now studying whether some performance divergences occurred in the last phase of Vikram's landing
 kyonki jab lander chand kii sataha se 2
 These machines of the lander had done the exact work till it was 1 km away

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi reached Ramnagar, the ancestral residence of former Prime Minister Lal Baha Dur Shastri, in Varanasi on Monday 
 laal bahadur shastri ke paitruk nivas par kisi bhi pradhanmantri ke pad par maujuud vyakti kaa yah pehla daura tha
 No Prime Minister had visited Lal Bahadur Shastri's ancestral house while in office before PM Modi
 ramnagar pahunchane par pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa jis tareeke se joardaar swaagat hua usko dekhte hue laal bahadur shastri ke putr sunil shastri ne kaha ki aisa swaagat ram nagar main laal bahadur shastri kaa hua tha jab vah pradhanmantri banane ke baad pehali baar apane paitruk awaas par aae the
 Anil Shastri said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's arrival in Ramnagar seemed to him like his father coming to Ramnagar
 pradhanmantri modi ne takreeban 20 minute kaa vakt laal bahadur shastri ke paitruk awaas par guzaara or is dauraan unhone laal bahadur shastri ji kii kai puraani tasviren bhi dekhin
 There was a picture at Lal Bahadur Shastri's house where he is looking at some files while traveling on the plane
 is tasviir ko dekhte hi pradhanmantri narendra modi ne kaha ki 'shastri ji kaam bahut karte the'
 On this matter of the Prime Minister, Sunil Shastri said that Prime Minister Modi works very hard like Lal Bahadur Shastri
 pradhanmantri modi se mulaakaat ke dauraan sunil shastri ne pradhanmantri modi se anurodh kiya ki laal bahadur shastri kepaitruk awaas ko memorial bananeke kaam main teji laai jaae jiskaa narendra modi ne bhi samarthan kiya he
 World No
1 batsman (test and ODI) Virat Kohli has been included in the list of great players with his consistent performance, but the World Cup in England will be a chance to make his mark as an Indian captain
 australian sarajameen par test siries jeetne vaale pehle bhartiya captain kohli aisi team kii aguwai karenge, jisaki apni kuch samasyaayein hai
 But he is no less than the teams that change the stance of the match, which is a necessary thing for the big tournament

 Third fast bowler or additional all-rounder? Kuldeep or Chahal or both? In the World Cup, Kohli's ability will be seen more as a captain than as a batsman
 isamen koi shaq nahin ki bhartiya captain is saat hafte tak chalane vaale toornament main kaaphi ahm honge jisamen unke 11,000 ran paar karne kii ummid he or vah kuch or shatak bhi apane 41 saikadon main jodna chahenge

 It may also include a fourth double century, but for this the vice-captain will have to continue the same form
 team main shikhar dhawan bhi hai, jinhone apane antarrashtriya aagaaj ke baad se isisi pratiyogitaaon main kabhi bhi kharaab pradarshan nahin kiya he or vah bhi is record ko barkaraar rakhana chahenge
 Troubles start after this and this is something that the team has failed to solve on paper despite the top three players performing well on several occasions
 or wo he chauthe number kaa sthaan, ambati raidu ke is sthaan kii daud main asafal hone ke baad yah charchaa kaa vishay bana hua he or rishabh pant ko bhi team main jagah nahin mil saki he
 At the same place, Dinesh Karthik's experience was preferred

 Let me tell you that a few days ago Surendra Singh gave a controversial statement and he said that Muslims have many wives and their children are of animal instinct
 itnaa hi nahin, ve doctoron ko 'rakshas' or patrakaron ko 'dalal' bol chuke hai
 The MLA has also urged Hindus to have more children to save Hinduism

 (ieenes se bhi input) Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday laid the foundation of his dream project Kashi Vishwanath Corridor by handing over several schemes to his parliamentary constituency Kashi
 is maukey par pradhanmantri ne kaha ki varshon se baba vishwanath bandhe hue the, saans bhi nahin le paa rahe the, lekin aaj is kaam se unhen mukti milegi
 He said that even when i was not in politics, i still thought that something should be done here
 lekin yah mere naseeb main hi likhaa tha ki mere haath se ye kaam hua
 The pm's statement to free Kashi Vishwanath, the center of faith of crores of people, is a rage among the learned people of Kashi
 kaashi ko kioto banane ke kram main kaashi vishwanath mandir ke vistarikaran ke liye lalita ghat se vishwanath mandir tak do sau se adhik bhawanon ko adhigrahit kar todaa gaya
 These include about 50 ancient temples and monasteries
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne kaha ki unhone 40 se adhik pracheen mandir jis par logon kaa atikaraman tha use bhi mukt karaayaa he
 Mahant Vishambharanath Mishra of Sankatmochan temple aajtak
 in se baatcheet main kaha, 'bhagwaan shankar sabko mukt karne vaale hai aise main koi unhen mukt karne kii baat kare ye anuchit he
 i am very hurt by this

 It is playing with the faith of millions of people

 If the Prime Minister means that i get them liberated, then it is right because they freed these Deities
 pradhanmantri bataaen kiske kabje se mukt karaayaa? kaashi main jo hua he wo akalpya he
 How would people feel when they come from all over India to see the Gods and Goddesses
 'kaashi vidwat parishad ke sanghathan mahaamantri deepak malviya kaa kahana he ki baba vishwanath kaa desh ke dwadash jyotirlingon main vishesh mahatv he

 baba vishwanath ke ird gird sundarikaran kiya ja saktaa he, suvidhaayen badhaai ja sakati hai lekin baba ko mukt karne kii baat kahana anuchit he
 Deepak Malviya said that for the construction of Kashi Vishwanath Corridor, the temples and Deities which were demolished and built on it are inappropriate process
 kyonki in sabhi dev vigrahon kii praan pratishtha hui thi

 com / kbw3xtaozx Narendra Modi, who speaks hour after hour in rallies across the country, remains silent in important party meetings
 
 
 loksabhaa chunaav 2014 main ummidavaar chunane ke liye bhartiya janata party kii kendriya chunaav samiti kii ab tak teen baithken ho chuki hai, lekin adhikansh siton par ummidavaaron ke chayan main narendra modi ne na apni raay rakhi, na faisle main dakhal diya
 
 
 The opinion of state units is being given the highest priority in the selection of party candidates
 
 
 aisa kam hi hua he, jab modi ne kisi vishesh seat yaa vishesh ummidavaar ke bare main kuch kaha ho
 
 
 Apart from Modi, LK Advani and Arun Jaitley also remain silent for most of the day-long meetings
 
 
 narendra modi ko kareeb se jaanane vaale party ke netaa kehete hai ki narendra modi party ke andruni faislon kii prakriya main kam bolne main hi vishwaas rakhte hai
 
 
 Not opening its cards prematurely is an important feature of Modi's style of functioning
 
 
 vah apni soch ke bare main bhi kisi ko andaaza lagane kaa mauka nahin dete hai
 
 
 His decision to contest elections on his own is also one such big step, about which he will decide and will keep his announcement till the last moment
 
 
 chaahe vah party kii ore se pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar hon or ummidavaaron ke chayan kii mahatvapurn prakriya unki is mahatvakanksha ke puure hone ke raste kaa bada padaav ho, magar narendra modi isamen dakhal dete hue nahin dikhnaa chaah rahe, or kaha ja rahaa he ki yah sochi-samajhi ranneeti kaa hissaa he
 
 
 In fact, under the top leadership of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a special kind of mistrust towards the central leaders of the BJP has taken place
 
 
 varsh 2004 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi kii karaari haar ke baad se pichley 10 saal main party adhikansh samay aapasi jhagadon main hi vyast rahi he
 
 
 The second generation leaders did not get enough time to fight amongst themselves and LK Advani, despite being the biggest leader of the party, started appearing with one of these camps instead of resolving these conflicts
 
 
 yahi vajah rahi he ki party se in netaaon kaa asar kam karne ke liye aresas ne pehle ek bahari vyakti nitin gadakari ko party kii kaman saunpi or ab narendra modi ko pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar banaaya
 
 
 By the way, Narendra Modi is not unfamiliar with the corridors of Delhi
 
 
 sanghathan mahaamantri rahete hue unhone hastinapur kii durubhisandhiyon ko najadik se dekha he
 
 
 He is not even aware that many party leaders are not happy with his candidature
 
 
 vah yah bhi jaanate hai ki kai netaa ab bhi is ummid main hai ki agar bijepi ko 170 ke kareeb siten ain to modi ke bajaae koi or pradhanmantri ban saktaa he
 
 
 Narendra Modi also has an idea of how deliberately in the decisions of coalitions and candidates are being hampered within the party, so that the bjp's objective of crossing 200 seats is not fulfilled
 
 
 murali manohar joshi ko yah naaraazgi he ki unhen kisi ne yah kyon nahin kaha ki narendra modi banaras se chunaav ladanaa chaahate hai or vah unke liye seat khaali kar kanpur chale jaaen
 
 
 Lalji Tandon is angry that no one came to tell him that Rajnath Singh wants to come to Lucknow
 
 
 kailash joshi apni bhopal seat bachaane ke liye adwani ko vahaan se ladane kaa aamantran de rahe hai
 
 
 Everyone expected that Narendra Modi would tell him, but it did not happen
 
 
 or modi chup hi rahe
 
 
 Actually, Narendra Modi is keeping himself away from the leaders of Delhi under a well thought out strategy
 
 
 modi kaa maananaa he ki bijepi ko behtareen kamyaabi dilaane kaa ek hi nuskhaa he, or vah he janata se sidhaa samvaad
 
 
 11, sitting on Ashoka Road cannot achieve this success
 
 
 narendra modi kaa kahana he ki unke or aam logon ke bich koi or nahin aayega
 
 
 On important issues, he communicates his opinion to the party president Rajnath Singh, but he does not want to give such a message as per his wish, or is happening
 
 
 pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar ke rup main chaahe narendra modi ko 'baraabar darje ke logon main pehla' (first amang ikvals) mana ja rahaa ho, lekin agar vah pradhanmantri banate hai to party ke sarvocch netaa ban jaaenge
 
 
 Then it will be interesting to see whether he will remain silent on the internal affairs of the party or openly speak on the party forum
 
 
 ek taraf to bharat ke 2024 menolampicki mejabani kii kavayad kii khabaren aa rahi hai vahi duusari taraf bhartiya olympic sangh ke sheersh adhikariyon ko hi antarrashtriya olympic sangh ke adhyatra kii sambhavit bharat yatra ke bare main jaankaree nahin he
 Indian Olympic Association treasurer Anil Khanna has written a letter in this regard and sought information
 anil khanna ne apane patr main likhaa he ki unhen akhabaaron ke madhyam se yah pataa chalaa he ki international olympic sangh ke adhyaksh 27 april ko bharat aa rahe hai
 He has further written that General Secretary Rajiv Mehta is also not aware of this
 gauratlab he ki pichley kuch dinon se lagaataar is tarah kii khabaren aa rahi thim ki bharat 2024 main olympic keyojan kii daavedarikaregaa
 There is also talk of the President of International Olympic Association coming to India and meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 lekin bhartiya olympic sangh ko hi is ghatana kii jaankaree nahin he
 In such a situation, it can be understood how serious the Indian Olympic Association is about the claim of organizing the Olympics
 congress-ensipi ke bich seat shering formulamaharashtra main congress-ensipi kii siyaasi takatbijepi-shivasena gathbandhan ke bich seat tay nahinmaharashtra vidhansabha chunaav kaa bigul baj chukaa he
 When the bjp-shiv Sena alliance has decided to enter the electoral fray, the churning has started with the sharing of seats between the congress-ncp as well
 ensipi pramukh sharad pavaar ne mangalvaar ko congress kii antarim adhyaksh sonia gandhi se mulaakaat kii
 It is believed that during this time, the nuances of the alliance and seat sharing were discussed between the two leaders
 aise main sawaal he ki kya congress-ensipi ek saath milakar bijepi-shivasena gathbandhan kaa muqabla kar paaenge
 congress-ncp has agreed on the sharing of 215 seats out of total 288 assembly seats in Maharashtra
 isamen congress 111 or ensipi 104 siton par chunaav ladegi
 The matter is stuck regarding the remaining 73 seats, which are being talked about by both the parties to resolve them soon
 bataa den ki 2014 ke vidhansabha chunaav main congress-ensipi ne alag-alag chunaav ladaa tha, jiskaa khamiyaja donon ko uthaanaa padaa tha
 BJP and Shiv Sena also fought separately in this election
 288 vidhansabha siton main se bijepi sabase adhik 27
 It managed to win 122 seats with 8 percent votes
 shivasena ne 19
 It won 63 seats with 3 percent of the vote
 jabaki congress ne 18 fisadi vot ke saath 42 siten or or ensipi ne 17
 It won 41 seats with 2 percent votes
 aise main agar congress or ensipi ke vot ko milaate hai to yah 35 fisadi ke kareeb hota he
 Whereas BJP and Shiv Sena vote together is close to 47 percent
 is tarah se agar donon gathbandhan chunaav main utarate hai to congress-ensipi par bijepi-shivasena gathbandhan kaaphi baari najar aayega
 Shiv Sena, a longtime senior partner in BJP in Maharashtra's politics, has been working as a junior partner in the alliance since 2014
 bijepi is baar ke chunaav main bhi isi bhoomika main rahanaa chaahati he, jiske tahat vah shivasena ko apane se kam siten dena chaahati he
 At the same time, Shiv Sena is repeating the agreement on the 50-50 seat formula
 iske alaava 2019 ke maharashtra vidhansabha chunaavon main bijepi se acha pradarshan karke mukhyamantri kii kursi par daavedaari kii baat ab vah saarvajanik taur par kar rahi he
 In such a situation, if there is no agreement between the BJP and Shiv Sena on the seat sharing and the congress-ncp join the electoral battle together, then the contest can be quite interesting
 haalanki jammu-kashmir se dhara 370 ko hataane ke baad bijepi kaaphi badhat banaae hue he
 Apart from this, the way NCP and Congress leaders have joined BJP, the party's spirits are very high
 loksabhaa chunaav ke nateezon ko dekhen to bijepi kaaphi frontroot par dikh rahi he
 In fact, after the results of the 2014 assembly elections, there was speculation that the NCP could go with the BJP due to the delay in the BJP and Shiv Sena agreeing to form the government
 yahi vajah rahi ki bijepi ne shivasena ko apni sharten par gathbandhan main shaamil kiya
 However, the BJP leaders themselves are dismissing the ncp's chances of going with the BJP in this time assembly elections
 pichley kuch dinon main ensipi ke kuch bade netaa sharad pavaar kaa saath chhodkar bijepi main shaamil hue hai
 In such a situation, it is unlikely that Sharad Pawar will be ready for any alliance with BJP in the near future
 bhrashtacharke khilaaf andolan chhedane vaale maharashtra kesamajasevi anna hajaareki ore se tarif paane vaale bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne unke prati aabhaar vyakt karte hue kaha ki isse aage kaam karne ke liye hausala afjai hoti he
 On the occasion of the Chief Minister's program at the Janata Durbar, Nitish said that this gives inspiration to work further
 haalanki, hajaare dwaara kii gayi gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi kii tarif par nitish kumaar ne kuch bhi tippanee karne se inkaar kar diya
 Supporting Anna Hazare's demand to enact a law on the right to recall public representatives, Nitish said that this was the main demand of the Jayaprakash movement, which the Janata government had termed as impractical
 yah maang 30 varshon baad phir uthi he, is par charchaa honi chahie
 He said that the people are universal in a democracy, when the people's representatives do not meet the requirements, then such a law is needed to remove them
 hamaare desh kaa loktantr paripakv ho rahaa he, isliye is prakaar kii maange uth rahi he
 Nitish said that the Bihar government has passed the bill from both houses of the Legislature to give such rights to local municipal bodies within its ambit
 mukhyamantri ne kaha ki chaahe jo bhi ho, jahaan bhi ho, apane apane tareeke se bhrashtachar ke khilaaf pahal kerani chahie yahi vakt kii maang he
 The Bihar government has made a solid start against corruption by implementing the Special Courts Act and passing the Right to Public Services Bill
 unhone kaha ki lok sevaaon kaa adhikaar kanoon vah 15 agast tak lagu kara denge
 The people of the country have become vocal against corruption
 media ne bhi ise pramukh mudda mana he
 On the question of going to the politics of the center, Nitish said that the people have given majority to develop Bihar, there is no point in going to the center
 congress ke varisht netaa, ranneetikaar or purv kendriya mantri jairam ramesh ne kaha ki bhaajapa chunaav vaale rajyon main bhayaavah str par sampradayik dhruvikaran kar rahi he or yah congress ke liye badi chunauti he
 Ramesh said that 10 Amit Shah of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) on every Amit Shah (BJP President) is behind the scenes and engaged in polarization work
 samachar agency bhashaa se baatcheet main congress netaa ne kaha ki taanaashaahee kaa nayaa nakhmit shahhai or narendra modi chunaav prachaar ke dauraan pradhanmantri kii tarah bartaav nahin karte
 He said that Modi misrepresents history and uses vulgar language for his political rivals
 congress netaa ne yah bhi kaha ki modi sarkaar ke mek in india kaarykram main farji khabaren sabase bada kaarobaar ban gai hai
 He also accused the BJP of making non-essential issues an issue
 ramesh ne kaha ki bhaajapa har chunaav main zyada se zyada sampradayik dhruvikaran kar rahi he or yah in rajyon main bhi kiya ja rahaa he
 The Congress leader also blamed communal polarization for the 'wanton' victory the BJP got in Uttar Pradesh
 unhone kaha, 'uttar pradesh main bhaajapa kii jeet ke liye mere paas ek hi spashtikaran he ki yah bhayaavah str kaa sampradayik dhruvikaran tha jo ve in rajyon main bhi kar rahe hai
 They are doing this in Chhattisgarh and certainly in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan as well
 'congress netaa bole- do tarah se sampradayik dhruvikaran kar rahi bijepisal 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav kii taiyaariyon ko lekar congress kii ore se gathit kor group ke sadsy ramesh ne kaha ki bhaajapa deshbhar main do tarah kaa sampradayik dhruvikaran kar rahi he
 One is being openly polarized, which is the language of Amit Shah and PM Narendra Modi
 iske alaava aresas or iske log parde ke peeche rahakar jubaan se or ghar-ghar jaakar dhruvikaran kar rahe hai
 Opposition does not understand the seriousness of the polarization happening behind the scenes: Ramesh, while taunting the RJBP president, said, "amit Shah is a good example of a person who openly does politics of polarization in Katni and Karni
 har amit shah par aresas ke 10 amit shah hai, jo parde ke peeche rahakar dhruvikaran ke kaam main lage hue hai
 The same thing happened in Uttar Pradesh
 congress netaa ne kaha ki vipaksh khuleam kiye ja rahe dhruvikaran par dhyaan nahin de rahaa he or parde ke peeche rahakar kiye ja rahe is dhruvikaran kii gambhirtha bhi nahin samaj rahaa
 Asked if the Congress has managed to deal with the issue of polarization, 'a long battle will run between the Congress and the RSS', Ramesh said, 'this is a big challenge
 mahaj chunavi chunauti nahin he
 Whether in power or out of power, we have to face this challenge
 ' aresas se congress kii ladaai ko lambii chalane vaali qaraar dete hue ramesh ne kaha, 'yah turant khatm hone vaali cheez nahin he
 It is a long running battle
 'congress netaaon ke ootpataang bayanon par rahul ne dikhaai he sakhtiunhone kaha kiko adivasee ilaakon main pakad banane main varshon or dashakon kaa vakt laga he
 When asked why Congress leaders like CP Joshi are making controversial statements, Ramesh said that Congress President Rahul Gandhi has shown a lot of toughness on this
 bhaajapa ko in bayanon ko mudda banane ke liye jimmedaar qaraar dete hue ramesh ne kaha, 'bhaajapa gaiyr-jaruri muddon ko mudda banane or khabaron main herpher karne main maahir he
 Make in India is Make in BJP: Rameshramesh said, 'I believe Make in India is Make in BJP
 bhaajapa shasankaal main farji khabaren mek in india ke tahat sabase bada kaarobaar ban gai hai
 The truth is that in his election campaigns Modi himself presents wrong facts and tells wrong history
 purv kendriya mantri ne kaha ki wo apane chunavi abhiyaanon main pradhanmantri kii tarah nahin bolte hai
 After all, the Prime Minister is the Prime Minister

 fasebuk pej ‘mission Modi 2019 main apane100 mitron ko joden’ ne bhi is video ko post kiya he
 At the beginning of the viral video on social media, a person is heard asking: 'why does Pandey ji want to remove Modi ji?' AFWA found that the video entrepreneur also tweeted his name in which he wrote Munna Pandey

 Sharad Pawar's Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) released its first candidate list for the Lok Sabha elections on Thursday
 isamen unki beti supriya sule samet kul 18 naam hai
 Rajya Sabha MP Supriya Sule from Baramati, the traditional Lok Sabha seat of Sharad Pawar, will contest
 shiv sena kaa mumbai se baahar vistaar karne main ahm bhoomika nibhaane vaale or pichley do dashak se sharad pavaar ke paale main khadey tejatarraar netaa chagan bhujabal bhi loksabhaa chunaav ke liye taal thonkege
 Bhujbal will contest from the Nashik seat with strong MNS influence
 iske alaava bhandara se upie sarkaar main baari udyog mantri prafull patel chunaav ladenge
 Here are the candidates of NCP - Baramati to Supriya Sule - Nasik to Chhagan Bhujbal - Bhandara to Praful Patel - Satara to Udayan Raje Bhonsle - Jalgaon to Satish Patil - Raver to Manish Jain - North East Mumbai to Sanjay Dina Patil - Dindori to Bharti Pawar - Navneet Rana from Amravati - Devdutt Nikam from Shirur - Vijay Bhamble from Parbhani - Rajiv Rajale from Ahmednagar - Krishnarao Ingale from Buldana - Dhananjay Mahadik from Kolhapur - Sanji from Thane And Naik - Kalyan Dombivali to Anand Paranjap - Osmanabad to Padma Singh Patil - Madha to Vijay Singh Mohite Patil himachal pradesh main ravivaar ko voting hogi
 a total of 68 assembly seats will be voted, with 46 lakh voters deciding the future of 459 candidates
 chunaav main congress or bijepi ke bich mukhya muqabla he
 Fifteen thousand polling stations have been set up for voting
 chunaav prem kumaar dhumal or virbhadra singh jaise diggajon ke liye agnipariksha hai jinhone apane apane dhang se matadaataaon ko lubhaane kii koshish kii
 While the Congress tried to create an anti-incumbency wave in its election campaign, the ruling BJP threw its full force on the issue of inflation and corruption
 bhaajapa or congress sabhi 68 siton par chunaav lard rahi he, jabaki basapa ne 66 siton par apane ummidavaar utaare hai
 Himachal Lokhit Party (36), Trinamool Congress (25), SP (16), CPI (15), NCP (12), Swabhiman Party (12), CPI (7) and Shiv Sena are contesting four seats
 105 nirdaleey bhi chunavi akhaade main ade main hai
 Under the leadership of Chief Minister Prem Kumar Dhumal, BJP is hoping to write history in Himachal on the lines of Punjab
 punjab main akali
 
 bhaajapa gathbandhan aitihaasik paripati ke vipareet lagaataar duusari baar satta main aayaa tha
 To a large extent, like Punjab, Himachal Pradesh has never had a government for the second consecutive time since 1977
 chaar navambar kaa chunaav sabit karegaa ki bhaajapa itihaas bana paati he yaa phir congress uttarakhand ko doharaati he
 Out of a total of 459 candidates who beat the electoral fray, 27 are women
 chunaav ke liye 7253 matdaan centre banaae gaye hai
 The highest polling station has been set up at a height of 15 thousand feet at Hikkim in Lahaul Spiti
 maton kii ginati 20 disambar ko hogi
 In 2007, BJP won 41 seats while Congress was limited to 23 seats
 nirdaleey teen siton par vijayi rahe the or basapa sirf ek seat par hi kabja karne main kaamyaab ho paayi thi
 BJP and Congress
 
 For both camps, corruption is a major electoral issue in the state
 congress ko koyala, 2ji or rashtramandal khel jaise ghotaalon kii vajah se gambhir aaropon kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 Although allegations of corruption remained a major issue throughout the election campaign, the Congress retaliated against Dhamul and his cabinet colleagues and tried to minimize their impact
 virbhadra singh saarvajanik rup se dhumal par yah aarope laga chuke hai ki unhone keemtee jameen kam daamon par khaas logon ko de di
 bjp's aggressive attack against Virbhadra on the issue of corruption came to a halt when party president Nitin Gadkari was also accused
 kal tak ke paridrishy ke anusaar mahangaai kaa mudda sabase majboot mudda banakar ubhara he
 The BJP leadership used the increase in domestic gas and diesel prices as a powerful weapon against the Congress and asked voters how their household expenses would be spent
 himachal jahaan rail network naganya he, vahaan dijal arthvyavastha kii jeevanarekha he or ghar par vaikalpik eendhan ke abhaav main alpiji gas bhi kaaphi jaruri he
 Dhumal introduced an induction stove after the Congress-led central government reduced the number of subsidized cylinders
 31 lakh mahila matadaataaon ko lubhaane kii koshish kii
 Local Congress leaders were forced to pressurize the Center to withdraw another hike in LPG prices at the last minute
 sirmaur jile ke amboya gaanv nivasee satya sharma ne kaha, ‘mahangaai hamen buree tarah tod rahi he or sabsidi vaale silendaron kii sankhya ghataae jane se hamaare ghar kaa bajet gadabadane ja rahaa he
 'himachal Lokhit Party formed by BJP rebels has made the fight interesting
 68 main se 22 siton par baagi asar daal sakate hai 
 The same thing happened in the 2007 elections when the margin of victory in 22 seats was less than 2
5 thousand votes
 40 siton par jeet kaa antaraal paanch hajaar se kam maton kaa tha
 In such a situation, the power of Dhumal and Virbhadra can be affected in the last moments
 himachal main 50
 01 percent votes belong to the forward castes
 anusuchit jati 25
 59, Other Backward Classes 4
 32 or alpsankhyakon ke teen pratishat mat hai
 Traditionally, the Scheduled Castes vote has gone to the Congress account
 himachal lokhit party ke rup main teesri takat, basapa, rakanpa or trinmul congress kii upasthiti bhi parinaamon par asar daalegi
 Independents will also influence electoral mathematics, having received eight percent of the vote in 2007
 us samay bhaajapa ko 43
 78 percent and 38 to Congress
 90 pratishat mat mili the
 BSP 7 in the last election
 26 pratishat mat hasil kiye the
 0 in CPI (M) account
 57 or bhakpa kii jholii main 0
 19 percent voted
 is baar himachal lokhit party kaa hissaa bane vam dal apane pradarshan main sudhaar kii ummid kar rahe hai
 If Dhumal, a two-time chief minister, repeats the victory, his strength in the BJP will increase before the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 kal ke chunaav main kinnaur jile ke kalpa gaanv nivasee 96 varshiya shyaam saran negi bhi apane matadhikaar kaa istemaal karenge
 According to Election Commission data, he is considered the oldest voter in the country
 sabaki nazren congress kii 84 varshiya vidya stokes par bhi hongi jo chunaav main sabase umradraj ummidavaar hai

 On the day of Karva Chauth, the women wished to remain fortunate and broke the vow when the moon appeared in the sky

 Imran Khan's appeal has been made by PAK journalists, PAK PM has appealed to people to demonstrate, on Friday afternoon, the appeal to stand up in favor of Kashmir on the issue of Jammu and Kashmir, Pakistan is angry and wants to create such an atmosphere that India Is oppressing the people of Jammu and Kashmir
 pakistan isko lekar duniyabar ke saamne guhaar laga rahaa he, lekin koi use sun nahin rahaa he
 Now Imran Khan has appealed to the people of his country every 12 noon to 12 noon
 30 tak jahaan bhi ho vahaan khadey ho jaaen
 This appeal of Imran is being criticized, only Pakistani journalists are trying to show Imran a mirror
 kai patrakaron ne likhaa he ki imran khan ko pehle dekhnaa chahie ki vah apane desh main kya kar rahe hai
 Many Pakistani journalists are constantly mocking, or criticizing, this appeal on social media
 aksar twitor par in muddon par likhane vaaleen nayla inayat ne bhi tanj kasate likhaa, ‘braking!! bharat se aa rahe hawa or pani ko pakistan 12 se 12
 Will stop between 30 ’BREAKING!!! Pakistan to stop air and water coming from India at 12 to 12:30pm
 - Naila Inayat Nayala Inayat (@nailainayat) August 29, 2019 Not only this, even after repeating the slogan of 'kashmir Banega Pakistan' by successive Pakistani leaders, they took a dig and wrote that Pakistan was not always like this, we have seen good days too 
 1962 main bhi ham tab kashmir jeetne kii hi koshish kar rahe the
 کسی نے کیا ہی خوبصورت تجویز دی ہے: جنرل باجوہ کو بارڈر پر جہاد کیلیے بھیج دیا جائے۔ Aیت گئے تو کشمیر آزاد ہار گئے تو پاکستان آزاد! What a great idea: General Bajwa shud b sent to loc for jihad

 Pakistani-origin journalist Taha Siddiqui lashed out at Pakistan Army Chief General Qamar Bajwa for writing that General Bajwa should be sent to the loc for jihad
 agar vah jitate hai to kashmir free ho jayega or haarate hai to pakistan free ho jayega
 Let us tell you that even before this, Pakistani journalists have questioned many decisions of Imran Khan
 phir chaahe airspes ko band rakhana ho, rajanyik sambandhon ko band karnaa ho
 While addressing the people of Pakistan, Imran Khan appealed that we have to show that we are with the people of Kashmir, then the world will listen to us

 The formula is suggesting
 aap sutron kaa kahana he ki agar gathbandhan sirf dilli main hoga to phir 5-2 formule par hoga
 In this, Congress will contest on five seats, AAP and two

 agenda ajtak ke duusare din "telecom kranti" seshan main digital india or cashles india par baatcheet hui
 Anjana Om Kashyap moderated this discussion
 seshan main bharat sanchaar nigam limited (beasenel) ke cheirperson or managing diarector anupam shrivastav ne hissaa liya
 Anupam Shrivastava said that the telecom revolution in the country has passed ahead of competition
 ab sector kii sabhi companiyon ko compatishan ke saath-saath aapasi sahyog ko bhi badhaava dene kii jarurat he
 Speaking on the steps taken by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to promote cashless system in the country, Anupam said that this is a very ambitious plan
 philhal desh main smart phone ke istemaal se cashles tranjaction kii disha main badi chalaang lagaai ja rahi he
 But the real benefit in this direction will come only when rural India will be fully connected to this system
 anupan ne bataaya ki kendra sarkaar kedigital india or cashles tranjactionke sapane ko saakaar karne ke liye beasenel ne gramin bharat ko apana kendra bindu chunaa he
 BSNL is going to start a service called mobicash very soon, which will make it possible to transact even with a simple phone
 cashles india banane kii disha main yah sabase bada kadam he kyonki isse dur daraaj ke ilaakon main rahane vaale logon ko aasaani se joda ja saktaa he
 Srivastava said that till some time back BSNL was no more than any technical department of the government
 lekin ab paristhiti teji se badal rahi he
 This change is coming at the initiative of the employees themselves
 ab beasenel kaa moto sarvice vid smil kaa he
 Under this, every employee of BSNL now makes its full contribution to improve the facilities being provided
 iske tahat koshish kii jaati he ki graahakon ko beasenel se rishta banane main kisi tarah kii dikkat kaa saamana na karnaa pade
 BSNL has seen a big change in the last few months
 yah badlaav vitt varsh 2014-15 or 2015-16 ke dauraan tab saamne aayaa jab company ne ghate se baahar nikalakar munaafe kii taraf kadam badhanaa shuru kar diya
 Due to this change, once again people in the telecom sector of the country have started recognizing BSNL
 haal main hue 4ji spectrum bantwaare main shaamil nahin hone par anupam ne kaha ki darasal beasenel is spactrum se alag apni ek stratji par kaam kar rahaa he
 He said that our strategy is to provide data to customers at the fastest speed
 iske liye hamane 4ji ke bajaae wifai hollspot kii madad se broadband conection kaa rasta chunaa he
 In the last few months, BSNL has set up over 4000 wifi hotspot networks in remote areas of the country and plans to expand it to 40,000 hotspots over the next two years
 yah network taiyaar ho jane ke baad beasenel kii sevaayen kisi bhi haalach main spectrum sevaaon se behatar hogi
 Apart from this, while speaking on the challenge being faced by the recently launched Reliance Jio Satelicom sector, Anupam said that he had earlier expected that his data service would fade after the launch of Reliance Jio
 haalanki unhone daawa kiya ki beasenel kii data sarvice main lagaataar ijapha jari he
 Anupam said that the new mantra is now in the telecom sector
 yahaan conmpatishan ke saath-saath colaboraton behad jaruri ho chukaa he
 This will benefit all the telecom companies as well as it will go a long way in addressing complaints of call drop and connectivity
 ek baar phir cashles india par bolte hue anupam ne bataaya ki gramin bharat ko iske liye taiyaar karne kii kavayad main usne desh ke 80 hajaar panchayaton ko bharatnet se jodne kaa bidaa uthaaya he
 In this effort, he has completed the work of adding 60 thousand panchayats so far
 is kavayad ke saath hi in panchayaton tak ab internet suvidha pahunchaai ja chuki he or vah cashles tranjaction kii taraf kadam badha sakate hai

 navaratri kaa paavan samay or mauka lakhanu main nae bhavy sachivalay bhawan ke udghaatan kaa jo ab uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri kaa nayaa karyaalay bhi hoga
 This magnificent building was inaugurated by Mulayam Singh Yadav and worshiped by Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav
 yaheen par akhilesh yadav ne aaj pehali baar naye sachivalay main apane cabinet kii baithak bhi kii
 But even on this memorable occasion, Akhilesh Yadav was seen with a lot
 chehre par khushi kii jagah pareshaani or chintaa saaf jhalak rahi thi
 The reason for this was that Akhilesh Yadav when he was coming to inaugurate this secretariat building, shortly before his uncle and Samajwadi Party state president Shivpal Yadav announced a list of candidates for the assembly elections
 saat logon ko tikat die gaye or 14 logon ke tikat kaat die gaye
 Giving tickets to Amanmani was a shock for Akhilesh but Akhilesh Yadav was troubled by the fact that the ticket was given to Ammani Tripathi, son of Amarmani Tripathi, a candidate from Nautanwa in Maharajganj district
 amanmani treepathi ke khilaaf khud akhilesh yadav ne unki patni sara singh kii hatya ke liye sibiai jaanch kii sifarish kii thi
 Amanmani Tripathi married Sara in 2013 and shortly after that there was a fight between the two
 baad main sara kii hatya ho gai
 In this case, there was a lot of trouble and in the end Akhilesh Yadav recommended the CBI inquiry after Sara's mother
 jaisaa ki aapako maaloom he ki amanmani treepathi ke pita amarmani treepathi or unki patni madhumani treepathi pehle sahi madhumita hatyakand ke maamle main jail main sajaa kaat rahe hai
 Akhilesh said- See what happens next, when Akhilesh Yadav was asked against whom he had recommended a CBI inquiry, how did he get the party ticket, then Akhilesh Yadav told me that he knew anything about it Is not
 pallaa jhaadne kii koshish karte hue unhone kaha ki tikat ke bare main unhone apane saare adhikaar chhod die hai
 And on going to Kurede, Akhilesh said that everyone knows what he thinks about it
 tab akhilesh yadav se poocha gaya ki tikat ke bantwaare main kya unki bilkul nahin chal rahi he? akhilesh yadav ne uske baad apni baat samajhane ke liye taash ke khel kaa zikr kiya or kaha ki ant main jeet usee kii hoti he jiske paas turup kaa ikkaa hota he
 Akhilesh said in a challenging manner that there is still time in the assembly elections and see what happens till the end

 ''majdoor sangh se sambandhit kanoon kai sanghon kii ijaajat detaa he, or koi sangh prabandhan or kisi duusare sangh ke bich hue samajhaite ko maanane ke liye baadhya nahin he

 Such laws give rise to strong labor elites and powerful trade unions
 is tarah ke shram kanoonon kaa matlab he ki sangathit kshetra ke karmchaaree desh ke kul kamgaaron kaa 10 pratishat hai
 Debroy believes that section 5-B is necessary to separate layoffs from company lockouts and temporary layoffs
 chantni utani vivaadaaspad nahin he jitna company kaa band hona

 The Justice Department said Rizwan Firdaus, a 26-year-old US citizen, has also been charged with attempting to provide explosive material and resources to foreign terrorist organizations, particularly al-qaeda, to attack US troops abroad

 It contained explosives and the aircraft had to be guided by the GPC system
 april 2011 main firdaus ne apni sajeesh kaa vistaar kar usamen ek anya sthaan par hamale ko shaamil kiya
 In May and June of 2011, Firdaus surreptitiously handed over two pen drives containing step-by-step instructions on the plot to attack the Pentagon and the Capitol
 sajeesh ke mutabik, is hamale ke liye remote control se chalane vaale teen vimaanon or chah vyaktiyon kaa istemaal kiya janaa tha
 Including the person who described himself as 'aamir'
 arabi bhashaa main aamir kaa matlab netritv karne vaala hota he
 According to the affidavit, Firdaus, a graduate in physics from Northeastern University, began plotting a violent 'jihad' against America in early 2010

 During a meeting in June 2011 when he was told that three American soldiers were killed and four or five wounded in Iraq with his first phone explosive device, he seemed satisfied
 firdaus ne kaha tha, ‘nishchit taur par vahi hua jo main chahta tha
 According to the record conversations of several meetings, Firdaus considered Americans to be 'enemies of Allah' and wanted to inflict psychological pressure on America by killing them
 halafname ke mutabik, firdaus chahta tha ki america par gupt tareeke se joardaar hamalaa kiya jaye
 He believed, 'I can't stop because i have no other choice
 ’may 2011 main firdaus boston se washington aayaa

 usne sanket diya ki uski jamini hamalaa yojana main chah log shaamil honge jo swachaalit hathiyaaron se las honge or do tiimon main bante honge
 Firdaus mentioned that his extended attack would be like this
 is hawaii hamale se ham 'pi' imaarat ke mahatvapurn thikaanon ko prabhavi dhang se uda sakate hai or baad main ham isamen anya thikaanon ko shaamil kar sakate hai tathaa ham ek kshetra chhod denge jo alag-thalag hoga
 There people will be helpless and we can establish our dominion
 usne bataaya ki logon ke ek baar alag-thalag pad jane par un par hamale kii yojana khuli hogi or afratfari machaane ke liye golibari kii jaaegi
 The affidavit stated that between May and September 2011 Firdaus conducted research, ordered and gathered the necessary equipment for its attack plans, including a remote-controlled aircraft F-86 Saabre
 apni giraftaar se pehle firdaus ne ‘under covers’ se 25 pound si-4 visphotak (jo vah maan rahaa tha) chah purna swachaalit eke 47 rifl (mashin gan) or grenade hasil kiye
 In June 2011, Firdaus rented a pseudonym store in Framingham Massachusetts to build its aircraft for the attack and keep all its equipment
 halafname ke anusaar fremingham store ko agast 2011 main epa-86 remote niyantrit vimaan mila
 In the course of a full investigation, Firdaus gave eight explosive devices to the 'under cover' that he intended to be used by al Qaeda to kill American troops overseas
 nyaay vibhaag ne kaha ki firdaus ne 20 sitambar 2011 ko ek prashikshan video banaakar under covers ko diya jisamen yah pradarshan kiya gaya ki ‘cellphone datonator’ kis tarah banaae ja sakate hai
 In today's meeting, the undercover allowed Firdaus to inspect explosives and firearms (three C-4 detonation grenades and six full-automatic AK 47 rifles), according to the affidavit, and Firdaus urged his assault plan

 garmiyon main in chizon ke seven se rahen dur-1
 Do not eat more spicy things - Spices increase the taste of food, but they also severely damage the health of people
 zyada masaale khaane se jalan, pet kii samasya aadi hone lagati hai
 Along with this, the temperature of the body also increases
 2
 Consume non-vegetarian items - Avoid consuming non-vegetarian items as much as possible in summer
 garm mausam main masaaledaar gravi vaali chizon kaa seven karne se body temparechar bhi badhata he, jisase zyada pasinaa aata he
 Also the digestive system is disturbed
 3
 Junk food - Instead of eating junk food in summer, consume green vegetables more and more
 hari subjiyon se sharir ko jaruri nutrients milte hai, jo kai bimariyon se dur rakhane main madad karte hai
 4
 chaay or coffee-ham main se adhiktar logon ke din kii shuruyaat chaay kii pyaali ke saath hoti he
 But both tea and coffee increase body temperature
 inamen maujuud caffin sharir ko dihydrate karti he
 Therefore, keep away from tea and coffee as soon as summer starts
 5

 darasal, cheez sos main calories kii maatra bahut adhik hoti he
 At the same time, the body needs more nutrition in this season
 isliye diet main healdi chijen hi shaamil karen

 Film: Jai Hokalakar: Salman Khan, Tabu, Danny, Daisy Shah, Sana Khan Director: Sohail Khanstar: Dhai (2
 5)jai ho
 The common man has arrived
 jo gurutvkarshan shakti ko spidar main kii tarah dhata bataata he or aayran main kii tarah gundon ko mukka martha he
 And then he says, i am a common man
 ye dekhte hi aapako yakeen ho jaataa he ki aisa salmaan khan hi kar sakate hai
 This Bollywood superstar can do anything and he does not even need a hat to become a common man
 magar is baar is cinemai superhiro urf aam aadmi kaa agenda sirf kuch dushton kii pitayee bhar nahin
 Between all the emotions and drama, he has to give an issue and way for the public good
 badlaav kaa yah tarika darasal 2006 main ai ek telugu film ‘stallin’ main dikhaaya gaya tha
 Chiranjeevi was in the lead role in it
 stallin ke zyaadaatar tukdon ko jyon kaa tyon uthaa liya gaya he
 Chiranjeevi made this film at a time when he was preparing to start his political party Praja Rajyam in real life
 usee tarj par film jai ho aam aadmi ke paksh main bane maahaul ko cash karaane ke pher main he
 Jai Ho's real strength is not story or acting, its stardom
 ise dekhakar samaj aata he ki tamaam kintu parantu ke baavjood kisi bhi film main salmaan khan ke hone ke myne kya hai
 It is also well understood by Salman's brother Sohail Khan, whose next few weeks will be spent counting the box office revenue
 salmaan khan film main bhartiya sena main major rahe jai agnihotri ke role main hai
 He would like to form a chain of help
 yah plot sunne main bhala lagata he, magar film main kaam karata najar nahin aata
 Jai makes many powerful enemies for this good work
 ye dushman sirf jai ke nahin, desh ke bhi dushman hai
 It is a very moving and worn formula of Hindi films
 aakhir main hero un sabko khatm kar desh ko mukt karata he
 Obviously a lot of drama and action will be needed to reach this end
 yahi salmaan film kii asal puunji bhi hoti he
 The film Jai Ho is full of actors
 tabboo jai kii bahan gita kaa kirdaar jald hi bhul janaa chahengi
 His part has come to shine the image of Jai's caring brother
 kahani ke kai ghumaav bhi unheen se hokar jate hai
 Clearly it was a far lesser role than Tabu's abilities
 samaj nahin aata, unhone iske liye haa kyon kii
 But keeping the understanding aside, one has to watch Salman's film
 samaj lagaayenge to ye aam aadmi vaala filmi tark bhi palle nahin padega
 The film appears to be a party of a foolish man, not a commoner
 agar aap salmaan khan ke jabanj kism ke fain hai, tabhi yah film dekhie
 Whistle and go home happy
 thode dinon pehle kii hi to baat he, lagata tha ki gaanv ujaad hi jayega
 Despite the excellent land, sensible farmers and plenty of water, the fields looked bleak
 pani kheton main thahartaa hi nahin
 The crops would remain thirsty
 lagata ki mahangaai kisi roj samoochee jameen hi nigal jaaegi
 One has to sell the farmland and go to the city every day
 lekin hua ulta
 Now farmers do not think of selling land, but are buying
 ve sochate hai ki jo bachche padhane ke liye bade shaharon main gaye hai, ve lautenge to fasalein or jhum uthengi
 Champaran is situated on the banks of Mahanadi, 22 km from Abhanpur in Chhattisgarh
 yah vah bhoomi he jahaan mahaprabhu vallabhacharya ne janm liya
 The cultivated land in this village of 22 hundred people is 680 hectares
 gaanv main ve sabhi sansaadhan maujuud hai jo ek achche gaanv main hone chahie, lekin tab bhi ek bahut badi khami yahaan ke logon ko hameshaa salti rahi
 The greenery spread around them seemed to be false, because even after plenty of irrigation, the produce from the fields could not get enough
 darasal, is ilaake kaa mahanadi kaa kachaari ilaaka hona kisaanon ke liye jahaan phydemand tha to nuksaandeh bhi
 Unlike other irrigation-rich areas, some different measures were needed to grow crops on this land
 jameen aisi nahin he ki nahar se bharpoor pani dekar bhi acchhee upaj lee ja sake
 The wells were also not able to succeed due to alluvial soil
 yahi haal nalkupon kaa tha
 For good yield on the land here, such resources were needed, through which some irrigation can be done in few intervals
 sarkaar ne samasya ko pahachaanaa or phir to jaise chamatkaar ho gaya
 Sobharam, the owner of 17 acres, got 23 acres
 bholaram chakradhari ab saat acre main kisaani kar rahe hai, jabaki pehle unke paas sirf chaar acre hi jameen thi
 Nohar Singh has also bought one and a half acres of land and is now cultivating four and a half acres
 gaanv main tractor, thriller, rotaweater, thresar kii awaajen gunj rahi hai
 Earlier only paddy was cultivated here, now the area of vegetables is also increasing
 makka, moongfalee, ganna, papeeta jaisi acchhee aamadani dene vaali fasalein lahalha rahi hai
 People are taking wheat and gram produce in Rabi
 yahaan tak ki matar or sarson bhi yahaan boi jane lagi hai
 The comments sarkaar ne samasya ko samajhate hi upaay shuru kiye
 The effect of these measures is that now this village is complete
 bachche gaanv ke skool main to padhate hi hai, 10 se zyada kisaanon ne apane bacchon kaa daakhila nayapaara ke angreji skulon main bhi karaayaa he
 Four children are studying outside the state in Delhi, Poona and Nagpur
 gaanv ke kachche ghar ab pakke makaan main tabdeel ho rahe hai
 The solution was very easy, but it took willpower to land on the ground
 rajya sarkaar ne krishi afasaron ko sakriy kiya
 In the fields of 35 farmers, shallow tube wells were mined using special techniques, they were given a grant
 in nalkupon main 20 spricolor or do drip system kii sahaayta se 115 hectare kshetra main sinchai kaa saadhan uplabdh kara diya gaya
 And just, life changed
 chhattisgarh main abhanpur se 22 kimi dur mahanadi ke kinare basaa he champaran
 This is the land where Mahaprabhu Vallabhacharya took birth
 22 sau logon ke is gaanv main kheti kii jameen 680 hectare he
 The village has all the resources that should be in a good village, but even then, there was always a huge flaw in the people
 chaaron ore faili hariyaali unhen juthi lagati rahi, kyonki bharpoor sinchai ke baad bhi kheton se upaj paryaapt nahin mil paati thi
 In fact, the region where the Mahanadi's alluvial area was beneficial to the farmers was also harmful
 duusare sinchai-sampann ilaakon se itar is ilaake kii jameen par fasalein ugane ke liye kuch hatakar upaay karne kii jarurat thi
 The land is not such that good yield can be obtained by giving plenty of water from the canal
 kuen bhi kachaari mitti kii vajah se safal nahin ho paa rahe the
 The same situation was with tube wells
 yahaan kii jameen par acchhee upaj ke liye aise sansaadhan chahie the, jinke jariye thode-thode antaraal main thodi-thodi sinchai kii ja sake
 The government recognized the problem and then a miracle happened
 17 acre ke maalik shobhaaram kii jameen 23 acre kii ho gai
 Bholaram Chakradhari is now cultivating seven acres, whereas earlier he had only four acres
 nauhar singh ne bhi dedh acre jameen kharidi he or ab ve saadhe chaar acre main kheti kar rahe hai
 The voices of tractors, thrillers, rotavators, thrashers are echoing in the village
 pehle yahaan sirf dhan kii kheti hoti thi, ab to subjiyon kaa bhi rakabaa bad rahaa he
 Good income crops like maize, groundnut, sugarcane, papaya are blooming
 rabi main gehun or chanaa kii upaj log le rahe hai
 Even peas and mustard are being sown here
 tippaniyan The government started taking measures as soon as it understood the problem
 inhen upayon kaa asar he ki ab yah gaanv sampann ho chukaa he
 The children study in the village school, more than 10 farmers have enrolled their children in the English schools of Nayapara
 chaar bachche rajya se baahar dilli, puna or nagpur main padhai kar rahe hai
 The raw houses of the village are now turning into pucca houses
 upaay bahut aasaan tha, lekin ise dharaatal par utaarne ke liye ichhashakti kii jarurat thi
 The state government activated the agricultural officers
 35 kisaanon ke kheton main vishesh takanic se uthle nalkupon kaa khanan karavaaya gaya, unhen anudaan diya gaya
 With the help of 20 sprinklers and two drip systems in these tube wells, irrigation facilities were made available in 115 hectares
 or bas, badal gai jindagi

 The stars of Sardar Singh, captain of the Indian hockey team, seem to be in the dark
 landan kii rahane vaali ek mahila hockey khilaadi ne un par shaadi kaa jhansa dekar shaareerik sambandh banane kaa aarope lagaaya he
 a case has been registered in this case, but the whole family including Sardar is calling it a conspiracy
 is maamle main sardaar ke daawey bhale hi kuch bhi hon, lekin 2014 kii media report par yakeen karen to unako fasebuk ke jariye apana pyaar mil gaya tha
 His love was well-known on the social site between the captain of the Indian hockey team and a player of the England Under-19 women's hockey team
 us samaysardaar sinhane khud kaha tha, 'ek din main apane fasebuk pej par aae miseje pard rahaa tha
 Then i saw a message in which it was written that Sardara Singh you are a great player
 ai lav you
 i immediately responded to this message, because my fan looked very different from others
 'under-19 hockey team kii thi khiladius samay sardaar singh ko us ladki ne bataaya tha ki vah landan main rahati he
 Has played for England's Under-19 hockey team
 vah bhi sikh he
 After this, the two had decided to meet at the London Olympics
 us samay in donon ke rishte se parivaar ko koi bhi koi etraj nahin tha
 'both were in a live-in relationship' The most interesting thing here is that the girl who describes herself as Sardar Singh's fiancé also lives in London
 usne bataaya ki 2012 main landan olympic ke dauraan donon kii mulaakaat hui thi
 Both were in a live-in relationship since then
 agast 2014 main donon kii sagaai bhi hui thi
 'abortion' when pregnant, the girl told that during this time Sardar also formed a physical relationship with her
 pregnent hone par usne aborshan karaane kaa dabaav daalaa
 He refused to marry her when she got abortion
 haalanki, sardaar ne in tamaam aaropon ko galat bataakar khaarij kar diya he

 Defending champions Spain have reached the final of the Euro Cup 2012
 pehle semifinal main spain ne portugal ko haraaya
 No team could score a goal in the stipulated time
 iske baad penlti shoot out main world champion spain ne portugal ko 4-2 se maat de di
 For Spain, Iniesta, PK, Ramos and Fabregas scored goals, while Nani and Pepe were the target for Portugal
 euro 2012 ke final main spain kaa muqabla germany or italy ke bich semifinal kii vijeta team se 1 july ko khelaa jayega
 The first half for Portugal was good overall as Spain had some better chances but could not redeem them, leading to a 0–0 score at half time
 spain ke footballer alvaaro arbeloa ke paas nauven minute main gol karne kaa mauka tha lekin vah chook gayi
 Similarly, Portugal captain Cristiano Ronaldo had a chance to boost the team by scoring a goal in the 31st minute of the first half but he shot in the wrong direction
 bhartiya captain mahendra singh dhoni ne vishwaas jataayaa he ki kharaab farm se jujh rahe yuvaraj singh tii-20 vishwacap ke baaki maichon main acha pradarshan karenge lekin yah sweekaar kiya ki vah baari dabaav main hai or lay hasil karne ke liye jujh rahe hai
 Dhoni told reporters, "yuvraj is one of the best players in T20 cricket but it is true that he is not in the best form in the tournament
 vanade team se baahar kiye jane ke baad tii20 team main vaapasi karne se kathin ho jaataa he lihaaja un par dabaav he
 ' unhone kaha, 'yah kahana aasaan he ki yah chota praaroop he lekin jab koi khilaadi team main aata he to us par dabaav bananaa laazmi he
 Yuvraj was able to score just ten runs off 19 balls against the West Indies yesterday but Dhoni is confident that he will return to form and play the role of match winner
 unhone kaha, 'isamen ek yaa do match kaa samay lagata he
 We know what a great match winner he is
 vah apane dam par match jita saktaa he
 Regarding Amit Mishra, who won the Man of the Match award for the second consecutive match, Dhoni said that he had advised the leg-spinner to use his strength
 yah poochne par ki unhone mishra ko kya salaah di, dhoni ne kaha, 'maine usase kaha ki apni takat kaa istemaal kare
 He was nervous against Pakistan, so i told him to fly the ball which is his strength
 ' The Indian captain also expressed happiness over the bowling of Bhuvneshwar Kumar, who bowled 16 dot balls
 unhone kaha, 'bhubaneshwar kaa kaam nayi gend kaa sahi istemaal or adhik dhili genden nahin dena tha
 He threw the ball in the right direction
 jab pich se thodi bhi madad mili to use sahi jagah par gend phenkani chahie
 He swings the ball well against the West Indies
 ' Dhoni said that Shami is a permanent option for death overs, but he can also exercise the responsibility of assigning this responsibility to Jadeja, Ashwin and Mishra
 unhone kaha, 'bhuvi nai gend kaa behtareen gendbaaj he
 i am not saying that he cannot put up a death over
 main jadeja ko bhi death overon main aajmaana chahta hum
 Shami is an expert on death overs but i want to try another bowler who can be Jadeja, Ashwin or anyone
 ' So what happened, failed in the exam, there is a lot to do

 jab 'javaabi dhamkee' ke bare main unke suzav puche gaye tomushrrafne kaha ki ji haa, ve hamen daraa rahe hai ki ve ham par apni pasand ke vakt or jagah par hamalaa karenge
 Now, it is not said by anyone else but the Prime Minister, Defense Minister, Military General, Director General of Military Operations
 unhone kaha ki yah bahut gambhir maamla he
 Threats such as attacking the time and place of choice should not have been given
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki yah jang kii sambhaavna ko badhayega
 So don't do it

 Pakistan Army, carrying international journalists along the border, took a group of Pakistani army journalists to places near the Line of Control and told them about the situation there, denying Indian Army action on terrorist targets
 donon deshon ke bich bade tanaav ke bich niyantran rekha par maujuud pakistani sainya adhikariyon ne kaha ki unki seemaa ke bheetar kisi tarah kii karrwai asambhav he
 The surgical strike, a blow to the Pak army, took a different step of its kind and took the international media closer to the border and described the situation
 bharat kii ore se kaha gaya he ki uske javaanon ne pakistan kii seemaa main ghuskaratankithikaanon ko nishaanaa banaaya he
 The crossing of the Line of Control from Indian troops is another major setback for Pakistan, which has already suffered embarrassment over the action of US military forces in Abbottabad in 2011

 Never thought that i would go into the corporate world
 yah mahaj ek sanyog hi tha
 i just wanted to do something different, which was also fun for me, with the flow of time
 apane isi darshan ke chalate aaj main paanch mahadwipon ke chah deshon main rahete hue kaam kar rahi hum, 45 deshon kii yatra karti rahati hum or sabase badi baat yah ki main duniya kii vividhtaon ko kareeb se dekh paa rahi hum
 After getting an Economics (hons) degree from Lady Shri Ram College in Delhi, i wanted to join the Foreign Service, but for this i needed to get a Master's degree
 maine dilli skool of iconomix or jawaharlal nehru uniwarsity, donon jagah eme main daakhila le liya, lekin bas ek hafte kaa hi anubhav liya kyonki mujhe indian institute of management, kolkata or jamanalaal bajaj institute of management studies, mumbai main admician mil gaya tha
 At that time i thought it would be more fun to live in Mumbai, so enrolled in Jamnalal Bajaj Institute
 tab bhi mere man main tha ki bijness kii degree lene ke baad videsh seva kii pariksha main baithungi
 But i got a job at Voltas while studying
 voltas ne mujhe jabardast avasar diya
 i launched Rasna in the market, which gave me instant success
 voltas main thode samay tak naukari karne ke baad main cadabri main chali gai, jahaan ek yuva brands manager ke taur par mujhe tatkaaleen global chairman sar adrian cadabri se unke bharat daure par milane kaa avasar mila
 It was a memorable moment for me
 cadabri main kaam ke dauraan 1982 main videsh main padhgaye ke liye mujhe rotary international kii ore se scolership mil gai
 i immediately seized this opportunity
 america main student ke taur par yah laajawab anubhav tha
 i did an internship at United Nations in New York
 vahaan duniyabar ke logon se meri mitrataa ho gai or vietnam, dakshin africa, cambodia aadi deshon main unke anubhavon ko janaa
 a few days later Cadbury proposed to make me Senior Brand Manager in the UK
 maine pehla airated chocolate vispa launch kiya
 It was an instant success
 us samay (1984-86) marketing ke logon ke liye videsh main kaam karnaa durlabh baat hua karti thi
 i was the first person from Cadbury India, working in the UK
 mere liye cadabri kaa mahatv ek or kaaran se bhi tha
 It gave me an opportunity to work in Nigeria and South Africa
 vahaan main cells or marketing vibhaag kii pramukh thi
 i then moved to the coca-cola Company, where i became the first Global Marketing Director
 coca-cola main meri duusari bhoomika bhi utani hi chunauti bhari thi
 i was made Vice President of Marketing for Latin America, Division President of the Andean Division, etc
 isaki vajah se mujhe santiyago main rahanaa padaa or spanish bhashaa seekhni padi

 These days this saying is applicable to Chhattisgarh BJP
 chhattisgarh se rajya sabha kii ek seat ke liye bijepi ke 25 netaa daud main hai
 Looking at this list of leaders, the party has handed over the responsibility of the final decision to the central leadership
 rajya sabha main jane ke liye bijepi ke bheetar ghamaasan machaa hua he
 The term of Bhushan Lal Jangde, who has deep penetration in the Scheduled Caste community, is ending this month
 lihaaja sansad main pravesh karne ke liye bijepi ke kai netaaon ne qamar kas lee he
 Apart from the BJP state president, many of the office bearers of the organization, former mlas, former mps and ministers are also included in the Rajya Sabha to attend the Rajya Sabha
 ye dharm guru apane samudaay ke vot bank ko bijepi ke khate dalwane kaa hawala dekar apana naam panel main shaamil karaane main kaamyaab ho gaye hai
 The list of BJP leaders desirous of going to the Rajya Sabha has become so long that Chief Minister Raman Singh and the central organization officials have to face a lot of trouble
 iskaa andaja isi se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki kataai-chantai ke baavjood 25 netaaon kii suchi taiyaar hui he
 For the first time, a panel named 25 leaders was sent to Delhi
 lambii suchi dekhte hue chhattisgarh bijepi ne yah jimmedaari kendriya netritv ke maathe par daal di he
 Of the five seats in the Rajya Sabha of Chhattisgarh, three are in bjp's account while two are held by Congress
 bijepi netaa ram vichaar netaam anusachit janajati varg or ranvijay singh judev saamaanya varg se abhi rajya sabha sadsy hai jabaki bhushan laal jangade ko anusuchit jati varg se rajya sabha main bheja gaya tha
 In such a situation, the possibility of deciding the candidate of this class from their vacant seat is more visible
 phir bhi duusare varg ke tamaam netaaon ko bharosa he ki is baar unhen nazarandaaj nahin kiya jayega
 In Chhattisgarh, the Rajya Sabha candidates are selected for ethnic balance, not the candidate's merit
 yah ek parampara si ban gai he
 However, many leaders who are angry over the inclusion of names in the panel are raising their voice saying that the party high command should take a decision over caste and religion
 bhartiya tej gendbajjasprit bumraahne chot ke baad apni shandaar vaapasi kii he or nottingham main unhone test cricket main duusari baar paanch wicket lene kaa karnama kiya he
 Jasprit Bumrah was instrumental in this match
 unhone duusari pari main 85 ran dekar paanch wicket liye
 But, former West Indies bowler Michael Holding has raised questions about Bumrah's bowling
 holding ke anusaar bumraah abhi bhi gendbaaji kii shuruyaat karne vaale gendbaaj nahin bane hai
 On comparing Kohli to Sachin, Veeru told who is the great batsman in a conversation with an English newspaper, Holding said, 'I still will not start bowling with Jasprit Bumrah
 iske liye eshanth sharma or mohammad shami sahi vikalp hai
 He said, "shami and Ishant prove to be more effective with the new ball and hence both of them should start bowling with the new ball in the absence of Bhuvneshwar Kumar
" jasprit bumraah puraani gend se zyada khatarnaak sabit ho sakate hai
 '82 years ago, Bradman did this feat, now unlike batsman Jos Buttler, who has been told by Bumrah that the bowling action of Bumrah makes him different from others
 butler ne kaha, ‘vah behad pratibhashali gendbaaj he
 His action is special and achieves good speed from it
 vah aisa gendbaaj he jo aapke saamne alag tarah kii chunauti pesh karata he
 Let me tell you that Jasprit Bumrah could not play in the first two Tests of the Test series due to injury, but he did not give up and made a great comeback in the team due to off camera hard work and fitness
 nottingham test match main bumraah ne kul 7 wicket liye

 aam chunaav kii tazaa khabaron se apadet rahane ke liesbscribakaren ajtak kaa ellection special newzlator The Shiv Sena has targeted the Maharashtra government after the suicide incident of five farmers in Vidarbha in 24 hours
 saamana main shivasena ne bijepi par sawaal uthaae hai ki chunaav ke samay kiye gaye vaadon kaa kya hua he? vidarbha main kisaanon kii haalat nahin sudhari he, aaj bhi 24 ghante main paanch kisaan jaan de rahe hai
 In his mouthpiece 'saamana', Shiv Sena has questioned the Government of Maharashtra and its policies
 party ne likhaa he ki chunaav ke vakt kiye gaye vaadon kaa kuch nahin hua
 The government has changed, but the condition of Vidarbha farmers has not changed
 usamen yah bhi likhaa gaya he ki mukhyamantri khud vidarbha se hai par kisaan vahaan aaj bhi mar rahe hai
 It was written in 'saamana', that due to Vidarbha's son Devendra Fadnavis, a new hope was raised among the farmers of Vidarbha, but in the last 24 hours, the farmers of Vidarbha committed suicide
 ye kisaan sookhe or karj ke boj main dabe hue the
 'the newspaper wrote,' Five farmers committed suicide in Vidarbha, four in Yavatmal and one in Chandrapur district killed themselves
 yahaan kisaanon ne jehar khaaya he, daaru nahin pi
 What happened to the assurances given during the election? Who has the responsibility to fulfill the assurances? These farmers can live with dignity, it is the responsibility of the politicians of Maharashtra
 'maharashtra sarkaar par sidhaa nishaanaa sadhate hue shivasena ne likhaa, 'kisaanon ne bijepi ke netaaon ko bhar-bhar ke vot die
 The Chief Minister, Finance Minister are all from Vidarbha, yet why are the farmers dying

 He made a distinct identity for himself by performing dance dramas on classical poetry works of Hindi
 25 june, 1980 ko varanasi main unka janm hua

 yahaan prastut kavitaayen raajakmal se prakashit vyomesh shukla kii kavitaaon ke sankalan 'phir bhi kuch log' se lee gai hai
 The poet Vishnu Khare had given his intention about this compilation and the poems of Vyomesh Shukla
 vishnu khare kaa kahana tha ki vyomesh shukla kii kavita 'booth par ladanaa' shaayad hindi kii pehali kavita he jo itane eemaandaar kaaryakartaaon kii baat karti he jinase khud unki 'secular' partiyon ke netaa ajiz aa jate hai, phir bhi ve hai ki apni ladaai ladate rahane kii tarkiben sochate rahete hai
 Such political poems of Vyomesh have stood against forgetting constantly and are the compositions of a participative activist and an eyewitness in whom tragic commitment, hope and a compassionate resolve are always present
 
 
 
 It should also be indicated here that how and when politics will come in Vyomesh Shukla's fraudulently different poems, or that an entirely underground and unsympathetic-looking composition has an underground political text, is not easy to tell
 
 
 
 
 These are poems that meet the 'agenda', 'polemic' and triple terms of art

 According to Khurshid, "when i doubted the intentions of Anna Hazare's associates, he said that he was aware of his mistakes, but he had no choice, because retreating would harm the movement
" lekin yadi sahyogiyon ne kuch adhik galat kiya to vah unka saath chhod denge
 "anna Hazare specifically said that Kiran Bedi has full faith in her and she will listen to him
" nyaayamurti santosh hegade bhi bahut samajhadaar vyakti hai
