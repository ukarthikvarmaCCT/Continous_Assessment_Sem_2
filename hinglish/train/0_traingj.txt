 During the debate on the bill brought in the Lok Sabha to enact a law against triple talaq, the sting operation of 'aaj Tak' was also mentioned in which the mullah-maulvi are looking for ways to cut it after the divorce is banned
 
 congress saansad sushmita dev ne ye maamla uthaaya, or sarkaar se jawaab maanga lekin bijepi kii ore se saansad minakshi lekhi ne apane jawaab main saaf kar diya ki is bill se sirf talaak-e-biddat hi nahin balki uski kaat ke taur par istemaal ho rahe talaak-e-bin ko bhi jurm mana jayega
 Significantly, the Supreme Court has declared the triple talaq as unconstitutional
 iske baad ise jurm banaakar iske istemaal par sajaa kaa praavdhaan vaala bill aaj modi sarkaar ne loksabhaa main pesh kiya
 During the debate on the bill, Congress MP Sushmita Dev questioned that the government will declare divorce-e-biddat i
e
 triple talaq, but divorce-a-bin is being used to cut it
 sushmita ne apni baat ke samarthan main 'ajtak' ke sting oparation kaa hawala diya
 It is worth mentioning that Aaj Tak's sting operation shown on Wednesday evening exposed many clerics who were separating their spouses through divorce-a-bin after the divorce-a-biddat ban
 talaak-e-bin main teen talaak bolne kii jarurat nahin he
 Speaking twice in this leads to divorce
 biddat setalakadene ke baad agar patni ko dobaaraa jindagi main laana ho to halaala kii rasm nibhaani padati he jabaki moulanaon ke mutabik talaak-e-bin ke baad agar bivi ko waapas jindagi main laana he to kisi halaala kii jarurat nahin he
 When the reporter asks if there will be any problem with the Supreme Court? Mufti Sadiq replied that there is no problem
 ye to parmishan he
 Today, when Sushmita Dev raised this matter in the House, Meenakshi Lekhi replied on behalf of BJP
 minakshi ne kaha ki pesh kiye gaye bill main sirf talaak-e-biddat nahin balki aise sabhi talaak jiske jariye ek jatke main patni ko alag kar diya jaataa he, shaamil kiye gaye hai
 That is, it includes divorce-e-biddat as well as divorce-e-bin
 aisa nahin hoga ki teen talaak bain hone par koi pati apni patni ko ek yaa do bartlak kahkar useghar se baahar kar de or kanoon ke shikanje se batch jaae

 99% GST on goods and services up to 18%! 97% goods services are within the same scope, so this Yashogan of 'revolutionary' generosity! Sometimes milk gets ripped in such a way that it does not even make cheese, raita
 jiesti kaa haal ab kuch aisa hi samajhie
 India's second independence (as it was said at the time of its introduction in Parliament at midnight) has changed in 18 months into a system whose economic objectives have been destroyed
 jiesti dam todta hua ek sudhaar he, chunaav se pehle jisase siyaasi laabh kii bachi-khuchi boonden nichodi ja rahi hai
 The revenue collection of GST is miles away from the target and the state of the treasury is crisp
 agar sarkaar shuru se hi do tex daron vaala jiesti lekar chali hoti to baat duusari thi lekin ab to jatiltaaon kaa ambara gadha ja chukaa he
 The government is not even aware of the fact that the prices of products or services have come down since the Gujarat election to the extent of concessions in the GST till date because companies are increasing the price due to cost overruns
 jiesti ke tahat munafkhori rokane vaala tantra abhi shuru nahin hua jisase pataa chale ki riyaayaton kaa phayda kise mila he
 There is also no evidence to increase consumption or demand or increase business of companies due to the impact of concessions
 to phir achaanak is tex dayalutaa kii vajah• pichley 18 maah main sarkaar ko ehsaas ho gaya he ki rajasav ke maamle main masik ek lakh karod ru
 The goal of collecting is difficult at the moment
 sevaaon se texkh sangrah main kami ai he
 GST is now running only on the tax contribution of the major manufacturer and service provider (who were also the major taxpayers in the previous system)
 chote karadaata or nae panjikaran vaale kaarobaari riyaayaton kii madad se tex chori ke puraane dharre par laut aae hai
 • GST is currently paying 60 per cent of business returns on average
 i ve bill lagu hone ke baad paardarshita aane kii ummiden bhi khet rahi hai
 Tax evasion is tough on the election watchdog
 • jiesti kii pranaliyaan va niyam abhi tak sthir nahin hai
 Darned patches continue
 • isliye chunaav se pehle sarkaar ne do kaam kiye ek—ritern form salanaa ritern (9) ko agle saal tak ke liye taal diya
 Without this, it is not possible for taxpayers to match (invoice matching) and tax credit
 yahi vajah he ki jiesti kaa arthvyavastha par koi sakaaratmak asar nahin dikhaa
 Two- If GST is not working, then at least it will lead to electoral gains
 jiesti ke siyaasi istemaal kaa centre sarkaar ke paas yah aakhri mauka tha
 The political geography of the country has changed in the last 18 months
 jiesti council main ab vipaksh ke rajyon kii sankhya bad chuki he isliye aage sahmati mushkil hone vaali he
 Recent council meetings also indicated this
 vipaksh shasit rajya, jiesti ko sire se badalane kii baaten karne lage hai
 Never had a minister said that there could not be a uniform tax on airplanes or cars in the country (now 99 per cent
 
 
 ) yaa jiesti desh se tex chori ko mitaa degaa athwa isse kaarobaar kii laagat kam hogi yaa isse jidipi bad jayega
 Today the government does not even want to hear questions about them
 kya jiesti rajyon ke waite jaise bhavishya kii taraf bad rahaa he? apane shuruaati varshon (2005-08) main safalataa ke baad, raajnneeti or vittiya dikkaton ke chalate rajyon ne waite kaa anushaasan taar-taar kar diya
 Although GST is more structured than VAT, but when the central government itself has made a mark of its discipline for electoral politics, the states will also break their discipline
 i ve bill main rajya stareey riyaayaten iskaa namoona hai
 In February, we wrote that the reformism of GST is now a matter of history
 bharat kaa sabase nayaa sudhaar sirf saat maah main puraane radio kii tarah ho gaya, jise thok-peet kar chalaaya ja rahaa he
 Eighteen months later, the radio is now running only electoral broadcasts
 kahana mushkil he ki agle saal jiesti kaa kya hoga lekin 2019 lagate-lagate yah sabit ho gaya he ki hamaari siyasat sudhaaron kii samaj or saahas sire se daridr hai
 GST is moving towards future like VAT of states *** america ke las vegas main 7 se 14 sitambar tak hone vaali vishwa kushti championships ke liye bhartiya dal kaa chayan mangalvaar ko hoga

 In the fourth phase of Lok Sabha elections, votes will be cast in 13 parliamentary seats of Uttar Pradesh on April 29
 inamen 5 loksabhaa siten anusuchit jati ke liye arakshit hai or in sabhi paanchon siton par bijepi kaa kabja he
 However, given the changed political equation due to the SP-BSP alliance this time, BJP has fielded new faces by cutting the ticket of four mps from five
 baavjood iske bijepi ke liye in siton par jeet doharaana aasaan nahin dikh rahaa he
 Hardoi: Hardoi Lok Sabha seat is reserved for Scheduled Castes
 is seat par bijepi ke jai prakaash ravat, sapa kii ushaa verma or congress ke virendra verma ke bich kaante kaa muqabla he
 However, in 2014, Anshul Verma of BJP defeated Shiv Prasad Verma of BSP by about 81 thousand votes
 lekin bijepi ne anshul verma kaa tikat katkar unki jagah naresh agarwal ke kareebi or pichley loksabhaa chunaav main mishrikh seat se sapa ummidavaar ke rup main chunaav haarane vaale purv saansad jai prakaash ravat par daanv lagaaya he
 Angered by this, Anshul Verma left the BJP and joined the SP
 darasal hardoi kii siyasat main naresh agarwal kii tuuti bolti he
 This is the reason why BJP has expressed confidence in his favorite, but due to the alliance of SP-BSP, there is a contest of this seat between Usha Verma and Jai Prakash Rawat
 mishrikh:mishrikh loksabhaa seat bhi anusuchit jati ke liye surakshit he
 On this seat, BJP has fielded Ashok Rawat, BSP Neelu Satyarthi and Congress Manjar Rahi
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi kii anju bala ne basapa ke ashok ravat ko kareeb 87 hajaar maton se maat dekar jeet hasil kii thi
 Like Hardoi, Naresh Aggarwal also won the Mishrikh seat
 yahaan bhi bijepi ne apane maujuuda saansad kaa tikat katkar basapa se aae ashok ravat par bharosa jataayaa he
 In such a situation, Naresh Agarwal has the responsibility of winning his close seats in both Hardoi and Misrikh, but keeping the seats in the political equation due to the alliance is a big challenge for the BJP
 shahjahanpur:shahjahanpur loksabhaa seat bhi anusuchit jati ke liye arakshit he
 In this seat, BJP has fielded Arun Kumar Sagar, BSP Amar Chandra Johar and Congress Brahmwaroop Sagar
 2014 main bijepi ke krishnaraj ne basapa ke umed singh kashyap ko 2 lakh 35 hajaar maton se maat dekar jeet darj kii thi
 Like Hardoi Mishrikh, Shah has put his current mp's ticket on Arjun Sagar in Shahjahanpur seat, but the way Congress has frayed the bjp's equation by fielding Brahmswaroop
 haalanki 2014 main sapa-basapa ko milakar jitna vot mila tha
 BJP alone got more than that
 aise main gathbandhan or bijepi donon ke liye yah seat jeetna badi chunauti he
 Etawah: Etawah Lok Sabha seat is reserved for scheduled castes
 yahaan se bijepi ne ram shankar katheria, sapa se kamalesh katheria or congress ne ashok kumaar dohare ko pratyaashee banaaya he
 In 2014, Ashok Dohra of BJP won the SP by defeating Premdas Katheria by nearly twenty five lakh votes
 lekin bijepi ne dohare kaa tikat katkar agra se saansad rahe ram shankar katheria par bharosa jataaya he
 Due to this, Ashok has got angry and joined the Congress and got into the fray
 dilachasp baat ye he ki itawa se bijepi ne jab bhi jeet darj kiya to centre main uski sarkaar bani
 In Etawah itself, for the last four years, Shambhu Dayal, as a possible candidate of BSP, was engaged in strengthening his roots
 lekin seat sapa ke khate main jane se wo shivpal yadav kii party se chunavi maidan main utar gaye hai

 We become capable with our hard work and mind, but sometimes our ability is not able to work for us on some occasions
 ye aise maukey hote hai jab kuch ghatnaon par hamaara jor nahin chalata
 This is what we call a bad phase in our language and the nature of a human being is such that he remembers God only in bad times
 tab vah unki sharan jaakar unase apni kamnapurti kii prarthana karne lagata he
 But one thing you will definitely believe that God does not even listen to everyone's prayers
 agar aap chaahate hai ki aapaki pukaar bhagwaan tak pahunche to aapako prarthana karne ke sahi tareeke ke bare main pataa hona chahie
 Prayer is the prayer to tell your heart to God
 isse vyakti apane yaa dusron kii ichhaapoorti kaa prayaas karata he
 By the way, tantra, mantra, meditation and chanting are also a form of prayer
 prarthana chote str par kaam karti he or isaki vajah seprakruti main aapke anuroop badlaav aate hai
 If many people pray a prayer at once, it is more effective
 ek saath prarthana karne par prakruti main teji se badlaav hota he
 Why does prayer become unheard of? Sometimes people feel that they are praying to God a lot but they are not being heard
 agar aap is sthiti main hai to ham aapako bataate hai ki aakhir kyon kabhi kabhi prarthanaayen naakaam ho jaati hai
 First of all, understand that prayer like business and transactions also fail
 prarthana ke naakaam hone kii kuch vajahen hai, jaise :- aahaar or vyavhaar par niyantran na rakhane se prarthana naakaam hoti ha- mata-pita kaa sammaan na karne se prarthana asafal hoti he- prarthana se aapkaa hi nuksaan ho rahaa ho to bhi prarthana naakaam ho jaati he- ataarkik prarthana bhi asafal ho jaati heprarthana ke niyamasahi tareeke se kii gai prarthana jivan main chamatkaari badlaav laati he
 - Prayers should be performed in a simple and clean manner and prayers should be spoken easily
 - shant vaataavaran main prarthana karnaa sabase badhiya hota he
 - Prayer is accepted quickly especially at midnight
 - prarthana ko rose ek hi samay par karnaa acha hota he
 - Do not pray for the purpose of harm of others or irrational
 - duusare ke liye prarthana karne se pehle uske bare main sochen or phir prarthana shuru karen
 If you have adopted these rules, then believe that your prayer is for the money or child or job, it will be complete
 prarthana karne kaa tareekaapaki prarthana aapke isht sweekaar karen, iske liye kuch niyamon ke saath prarthana kerani chahie
 Learn about these rules: - First of all sit in a secluded place - after that keep your spine absolutely straight - then first meditate on your Ishta, Guru Yaiswar - After that do the prayer you want to do - your Keep the prayer confidential - whenever you get a chance, keep repeating your prayers
 If you pray with true heart in these ways, then your wish will surely be fulfilled

 congress ne aaj in baton ko sire se khaarij kiya ki party adhyaksh sonia gandhi or upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ke bich kisi tarah ke matbhed hai
 The party also described the recent statements made by senior leaders Kamal Nath and Digvijay Singh as his 'personal opinion', in which things like confusion and generational difference were said
 party ne saaf kiya ki sonia or rahul 'ekajute' tareeke se sanghathan ko sanchalit kar rahe hai
 In a press conference of the All India Congress Committee, party spokesperson Rajiv Gowda said, 'many leaders are expressing their personal opinions
 jahaan tak congress ke netaaon evam kaaryakartaaon kaa sawaal he, ham adhyaksh (sonia) or upaadhyaksh (rahul) dwaara party ko ekajute tareeke se chalaae jane ko lekar kaaphi khush hai
 ' baharhaal, gauda ne is sambhaavna se bhi inkaar nahin kiya ki rahul is saal kisi bhi samay party adhyaksh kaa pad sambhaal sakate hai
 Asked whether the party will bring generational changes in the coming session of the All India Congress Committee in the coming session, Gowda asked the late Congress President
 kamraj kii mashhoor tamil tippanee karte hue 'parakalam' yani intjaar kariye or dekhie kaha
 The committee's session can be held in April

 After taking over from Sitaram Kesari in 1998, Sonia has been the longest serving Congress president
 sonia kii tippanee ke bare main poochne par gauda ne kaha, 'jab hoga tab ham dekhenge
 There is strong speculation that Rahul may be made Congress President in the session of the All India Congress Committee to be held in the first week of April
 nau baar se congress ke loksabhaa saansad camel nath ne kal kaha tha ki ek hi party main nirnay karne vaali do ikaiyaan hai
 He also said that Rahul should hand over the command of the Congress completely
 kamalnath ne kaha tha, 'sonia gandhi sochati hai ki rahul kuch kar rahe hai or rahul sochate hai ki sonia gandhi kuch kar rahi hai
 a situation is required in which Rahul has command in his hands
 ' While dismissing speculation about Rahul's 'escape' from politics, Digvijay said that he would play a 'big role' when he returned from leave
 unhone yah bhi kaha tha ki maa-bete ke bich 'matbhed kaa koi sawaal hi paidaa nahin hota' or 'unke bich parivaar ke sadasyon kii tarah hi majboot sambandh hai
 ' yah puche jane par ki kya donon netaaon main raajnneetik taur par matbhed hai, is par digvijay ne kaha tha, 'donon alag-alag pidiyon ke hai
 Certainly every generation has a different mindset

 ham log alag gender hai or do tarah kii jindagi jite hai savita singhira taakah mahilaon ko daayre main rakhkar khwab dekhnaa sikhaaya jaataa haisapane ke peeche mat bhaagie, aap kursi par baithiye, kahie aaoh aakankshasahitya ke sabase bade mahakumbh 'sahitya ajtak 2019' ke manch ke tisare din 'ladakiyon ke khwab' vishay par yojit goshtee main shaamil teenon mahila lekhakon ne sweekaar kiya ki ladakiyon ko khwab dekhne ke zyada maukey to nahin milte hai
 The girls are allowed to see the dreams already prepared
 khwab dekhne ko lekar badlaav kiye jane kii jarurat he
 It is also true that girls are different from boys and their dreams should be allowed to be seen differently
 kya ladakiyon ke khwab ladakon se alag hote hai ke sawaal par kavyitri or esdies ignu kii nideshak professor professor savita singh ne kaha ki yah maananaa hi hoga ki ham log alag gender hai or do tarah kii jindagi jite hai
 Even while living in a society our life is different
 alag-alag rahete hue bhi hamaara jivan saath kaa bhi he
 Girl dreams different from boys: Savita Singh Professor Savita Singh further said that how much life we want and how much different life we want to live is the real issue
 bahut saare log aise hai jo maanate hai ki striyon kaa jivan alag se nahin hota he
 There is not much difference in them that there is something different in life for them
 aisi bahut si striyaan bhi hai jo khwab dekhati hai or unke khwab purushon ke kareeb bhi ho sakati he or unase bhinnata bhi ho sakati he
 Professor Savita Singh also read xxrep 4 - 'good-bad touch what, teach children the need for such stories'
 He said that we are Indians
 ham ek khaas dharm, jati, langikta se sambandhit hai
 Girls have different dreams
 ladakiyon ke khwab kii baat kii jaae to madhya varg kii ladakiyon ke khwab he professor bananaa, doctor bananaa, poilat bananaa aadi hi hota he
 Their dreams are the same as the middle class dreams and this dream was once the dream of men
 mahilaon main khwab aage chalakar kya rup legaa is par abhi kuch nahin kah sakate
 Professor Ira Taklakari considers himself a human being: Ira Takira Tak says on this question that seeing girls' dreams is different in that sense because they get ready-made dreams
 madhya varg hi nahin ucch varg kii ladakiyon ke liye yahi sthiti he
 Women are given dreams
 hamen ek daayre main rakhkar ek khwab dekhnaa sikhaaya jaataa he
 Girls should consider themselves human
 vah bhi ek insaan hai or unhen bhi sapane dekhne kaa haq he
 Never in life should we regret that we could not do anything
 professor aakanksha paare kashivalekhika aakanksha paare kashiv ne ladakiyon ke khwab par kaha ki ladakiyon ke khwab ko lekar condishan applai hote the jo dusron ko nahin dikhte the
 Even girls themselves do not see
 condishan applai kaa matlab he ki ladakiyon ko kahin janaa he
 This is the big thing that is not visible, but its effect is big
 ladakon ke sapane ladakiyon se alag hote hai kyonki ladakon or ladakiyon ko alag-alag chijen karne ko kaha jaataa he
 Woman behind every successful woman: Ira Tak author and filmmaker Ira Tak said that behind every successful woman is the woman's hand
 aaj ke daur main stri kii kamyaabi main stri kaa hi yogadan rahaa he
 Although the saying of 'woman is the enemy of woman' is a fatherly fact, but it is also true
 jab koi ladki safal hoti he to sabase pehle ladkiyaan hi jaj karne lagati hai
 He said that we start thinking that bad happened to us and was not allowed to proceed
 unhen lagata he ki jo sapane unhen dekhne nahin die gaye vahi dusron ke saath bhi ho
 Whereas in this regard, it can also be done in such a way that something which could not happen to you should not be for anyone else
 is tarah ke badlaav kiya janaa chahie
 When a woman says a good thing about a woman, why does she say infertile? Akanksha said that this is a woman's dream and people expect too
 unhone kaha ki pita or bhai bachapan se hamen dekhte hai to wo hamen aage badhane main madad karte hai, lekin aage bhi kai log milte hai jo aage badhaane main madad karte hai
 Akanksha said, don't run after the dream, you sit in the chair and ask them to come
 prem ke bare main kaha ki aap khul kar prem karo
 Love animals, love the poor
 har kisi se prem karo

 The 28th match of IPL season 11 between Rajasthan Royals and Sunrisers Hyderabad will be played at Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur from 4 pm today
 hyderabad jab rajasthan ke khilaaf maidan par utregi to uski najar jeet kii hetric par hogi
 Captain Kane Williamson, who started the IPL season with three consecutive wins, lost his way against Hyderabad, Kings XI Punjab and Chennai Super Kings, but won the low-scoring matches against Mumbai Indians and Punjab
 The team has regained its confidence
 sunrisers hyderabadpoints teble main sunrisers hyderabad duusare sthaan par he
 His share is five wins from seven matches
 captain williamson ne team kii ballebaaji ko bakhubi sambhala he
 He was 43 in seven innings so far
 16 kii ausat se 259 ran banaae hai
 Hyderabad's batting is largely dependent on Williamson
 uske liye sabase badi chintaa salaami ballebaaj shikhar dhawan or riddhimaan saaha kaa na chalanaa he
 Both of them have disappointed the team so far
 saaha ne abhi tak sirf 68 ran banaae hai
 At the same time, Dhawan has put 146 runs in his five innings
 isse pehle jab donon timen aapas main bhidi thim tab yusuf pathan ne 27 gendon main 45 ranon kii pari kheli thi
 But after this he could not continue this form against Mumbai and Punjab

 afghanistan ke raashid khan or bangladesh ke spinner shaakib al hasan kii jodi ne abhi tak team kii safalataa main ahm bhoomika nibhaai he
 One of the reasons for beating Mumbai and Punjab in the low-scoring match was the spin duo
 shaakib ne abhi tak aath wicket apane naam kiye hai to vahiin raashid ke hisse nau safaltaaen ai hai
 Among the fast bowlers, Siddharth Kaul and Basil Thampi have been very effective
 siddharth ne saat maichon main nau wicket apane naam kiye hai
 Though Basil has played fewer matches, he has impressed in all the games he has played

 His parts are three wins in six matches and an equal defeat
 rajasthan paanch maichon main chah ankon ke saath paanchaven sthaan par he
 Rajasthan, however, did not start their campaign well
 use pehle match main hi hyderabad ne nau wicket se haraaya tha
 After this, however, the team regained momentum and beat Delhi Daredevils and Royal Challengers Bangalore in two consecutive matches
 iske baad kolkata nite rides or chennai se use haar mili, lekin mumbai ko maat dekar rajasthan ne ek baar phir jeet kii raah par vaapasi kar lee he
 The team's lack of batting is that its batsmen could not convert a good start into a big innings and left the team in the middle at critical times
 captain rahane par team ke ballebaaji kram kii jimmedaari he, jisamen unhen ben stokes or rahul treepathi se sahyog kii ummid hogi
 The only good thing in the team's batting so far, is that Sanju Samson's bat is going on continuously
 is match main rahane ummid karenge ki samson balle se kamaal dikhaaen
 The team's bowling has been average, and here too it needs to raise the level of its game

 com / rcgitjnpko Former Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit admits that there were shortcomings in building the BRT corridor, which she could not overcome, but breaking it was not the solution to the problem
 unka kahana he ki kamiyon or khaamiyon ko sudhaarna chahie tha
 At the same time, his emphasis was also that breaking without any trial would be a waste of money
 lagaataar gadiyon kii badhati taadaad or jam se juujhati dilli kaa bhavishya innovations par he
 And for this purpose the foundation of BRT was laid, constructed
 tippaniyan Sheila Dixit believes that there was a lot of opposition to BRT, but people appreciated it
 tark ke taur par bataati hai ki ye logon ke samarthan kaa hi nateeja tha ki iske banane ke baad bhi biarti ke aasapaas kii sabhi siten congress kii jholii main gai thi
 Recalling the old days, Sheila Dixit says that as long as we were in government, it went on despite the flaws
 hamaari sarkaar jane ke baad iske implementation main kami rah gai
 If traffic was going on in the discipline, we had thought of such a model in four more places like this

 i would like the government to say, 'your decision
 main ummid karti hum ki ye faisla kuch behatar baat saamne laaegaa

 ' shila dikshit maanati hai ki biarti ko lekar khub virodh hua, lekin logon ne isko saraahaa bhi
 As an argument, it was a result of the support of the people that even after it was formed, all the seats around BRT went to Congress
 puraane dinon ko yaad karte hue shila dikshit kahati hai ki jabatak ham sarkaar main the tabatak khaamiyon ke baavjood bhi ye chalaa
 After the departure of our government, there was lack of implementation
 agar disiplin main trephic chalata to is tarah ke chaar or jagahon par hamane aisa model soch rakhaa tha
 Also saw the Central Bus Stand on the side, but could not succeed
 sarkaar ko yahi kahana chaahuungi, 'aapkaa faisla he
 i hope that this decision will bring out something better

 Once again the open drain in Ghaziabad, adjacent to Delhi, became the cause of death of a 15-year-old boy
 yah ladkaa dasvin kaksha kaa chaatr tha
 In Sarvodaya Nagar Colony of Police Station Vijay Nagar area of ghaziabad, there was an atmosphere of panic on Saturday, when the road overflowed after the sudden rains came in the afternoon, the road also became full with rain water
 isi dauraan ek dasvin kaksha kaa padhane vaala chaatr naale main samaa gaya
 However, people standing on the spot tried their best to save the student
 lekin tej bahaav ke kaaran kishor naalee main bah gaya
 In a hurry it was reported to the local police

 Also, the fire department team and NDRF team were called to the spot
 kareeb 4 ghante kii kadi mashkkat ke baad kishor ko naale se baahar nikaala gaya or tatkaal prabhaav se use aspataal pahunchaaya gaya
 But doctors at the hospital declared him dead
 baharhaal gajiabad main khule naale lagaataar maut ke naale sabit ho rahe hai
 Residents of Vijayanagar police station area Shivpuri area, Ashok's two sons named Dipanshu and Shubham studied in class 10 at Saint Teresa School in Sarvodaya Nagar Colony in Thana Vijay Nagar area
 donon hi apni-apni cycle se skool jate the
 Shortly after the rain, there was a school holiday, so Shubham left his bicycle shortly before his brother Dipanshu
 vah ghar pahunch gaya lekin dipanshu nahin
 Suddenly heavy rains occurred in the afternoon, due to which all the rainy sewers filled up and the water on the road also became full
 chaaron taraf pani hi pani najar aa rahaa tha
 Meanwhile, 15-year-old Dipanshu was going home with his bicycle but the bicycle went towards the drain and he was swept away in the fast water
 is dauraan paas main khadi ek ladki ne use girte hue dekha to shor machaaya
 People gathered at the scene
 haalanki use bachaane kaa prayaas kiya gaya lekin pani kaa bahaav itnaa tej tha ki vah dipanshu bah gaya
 However, his bicycle was found at some distance
 aanan- fanan main isaki soochna sthaneey police ko di gai
 On the basis of information, police reached the spot and started searching for Dipanshu with the help of local people
 lekin kisi tarah kii kamyaabi na milane ke baad damakal vibhaag kii team or andiaref kii team ko maukey par bulaayaa gaya
 After 4 hours of hard work, Dipanshu was found stuck in a litter inside the drain about 400 meters away, which was rushed to the hospital in a hurry
 lekin doctoron ne use mrit ghoshit kar diya
 As soon as Dipanshu's family heard this news, the ground slipped under his feet
 udhar ilaake ke logon main bhi nagar nigam ke khilaaf behad gussa he
 They fiercely whipped the municipal corporation, but the policemen present on the spot somehow pacified the people at that time
 logon kaa aarope he ki is ilaake main tamaam naale khule pade hai, jo hameshaa logon kii maut ko daavat dete rahete hai
 People say that many times the municipal authorities have also been made aware of this
 uske baavjood bhi is taraf koi dhyaan nahin diya gaya
 Due to this, Deepanshu got absorbed in the cheeks of Kaal
 khule naale lagaataar masuumon kii jaan le rahe hai
 Dipanshu died due to open drain, due to which the responsibility of the incident is clearly with the Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation and the Ghaziabad administration
 haalanki prashasan ke adhikari aaj hi safai ke liye naale ko khole jane kii baat kah jimmedaari se bachate najar aae
 But the question is that if the drain was opened due to cleanliness and the work was stopped due to rain, then why was the drain not covered again
 saath hi aisi koi vaikalpik vyavastha kyon nahin kii gai ki koi haadasa yahaan na ho
 However, the Municipal Corporation and local administration officials are saying that the investigation into the whole incident is happening

 nikita mehta ko maa bananaa hoga
 The Bombay High Court refused to allow an appeal to destroy a 26-week-old fetus with a severe heart disorder, stating that the young mother's request to undergo an abortion is a mercy death
 nikita bhi ek aurat he, wo bhi bananaa chaahati he maa
 That is why he has kept a six month old baby in his womb
 lekin, wo nahin chaahati ki uskaa baccha biimaar paidaa ho, uske bachche kii zindagi takalif se bhari ho
 When she came to know that the child had a hole in her heart, she went to the court for approval of abortion
 lekin doctoron kii raay or kanoonee pahaluon ko dekhte hue uski daleelein khaarij kar di gayi
 Rejecting the plea of nikita Mehta, who is swinging between mental anguish and moral issues, the court said that medical experts have not given a clear opinion that if the child is born, it can be seriously handicapped
 nyaayamurti khandeparkar ne kaha ki aap yah nahin jaanate ki vikruti kis had tak he
 Can you destroy a life unhone use dayaa mrityu ke samaan paaya
 a division bench of Justice Khandeparkar and Justice Amjad Syed said that its order was based on the opinion of three doctors of the JJ Hospital doctors panel, which said that the chances of the child being born are disabled or incapacitated
 isse pehle is panel ne kaha tha ki aisa hone kii bahut adhik sambhaavna he
 The court felt that the impartial experts consulted by the petitioners Nikita and her husband gave no basis for their conclusion regarding the quality of life of the child
 nyaayamurti khandeparkar ne kaha yah kanoon nirmaataaon kaa kaam he ki ve praavdhaan main badlaav kar aapaki sahaayta karen
 We cannot make provision for you
 atirikt solicetre general rajendra raghuvanshi ne bataaya ki adaalat ne mahasoos kiya ki maujuuda kanoon nikita ko uskaa bhun nasht karne kii ijaajat nahin dete
 Nikita's lawyer Amit Kharakanis said that although the Mehta family is disappointed, it has not been decided to go to the Supreme Court
 adaalat ne jeje aspataal ke teen doctoron vaale panel kii raay par bhi gaur kiya
 This panel had previously opined that there is a high probability that the child born may be disabled or incapable
 baad main panel ne apni raay badalte hue kaha ki is baat kii ksheen sambhaavnaayen hai ki paidaa hone vaala shishu viklang hoga
 Nikita is running at 26 weeks of pregnancy
 usne pichley hafte adaalat kaa darwaja khatkhataakar apane pehle bhrun ko nasht karne kii ijaajat maangi thi kyonki uske doctor ko 24wein hafte main is baat kaa pataa chalaa ki shishu ko hriday sambandhi vikaar he
 The court then constituted a committee of doctors
 adaalat ne yachikakarta nikita or uske pati harsh mehta evam unke doctor nikhil daataar ko yah chhot di ki ve swatantra raay hasil kar sakate hai
 Petitioner Nikita and her husband told the court that they wanted to destroy the fetus because the baby would need a pacemaker from birth and the quality of life would also deteriorate
 madhyamvargeey is danpati ne kaha pesamekar kaa kharchaa kareeb ek lakh rupye aata he or vah simit samay tak hi chal paata he
 This family said that it would not be financially possible for them to change the pacemaker every five years
 ye ek nikita kii kahani he
 But, there may be more Nikita
 maamla saamaajik sarokaar se judaa he, isliye samaaj main bhi shuru ho gai he ek bahes
 Two generations, two thoughts
 mudda gambhir he or bahes bhi
 Union Health Minister Anbumani Ramadoss also says that if there is a serious result from the debate, it will be considered
 unka kahana he ki ‘ek udhaaharan kii vajah se aisa nahin lagata ki kanoon main badlaav kaa vakt he, lekin bahes honi chahie or sarkaar bahes ke nateezon ko gambhirtha se legi
 By the way, the medical report has convinced the court that even if Nikita's child is unwell, treatment is possible
 jaahir he aisa hi hua to sabase zyada khush nikita hi hogi
 And if the debate over Nikita reaches some end, then it can be good for other Nikita as well

 'he said,' When Modi was called a 'merchant of death', the people had taught the Congress a lesson

Kalu Lal Gurjar, bjp's chief whip in the assembly, said that when all the mlas made a demand before the Chief Minister, we said what is the problem of getting the poojas done once?

 China has given the principle of socialist market coming to India
 Chinese President Xi Jinping has recently celebrated the 70th anniversary of communist rule in China
 is maukey par sabase mahatvapurn chini raashtrapati shi jinping kaa bhaashan rahaa
 He said in his address, 'in the 70 years under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the people have been continuously trying to achieve their goals
 china ne chini visheshta vaale samaajawaadee raste par aage badhkar nae yug main pravesh kiya he
 Thousands of years of poverty before the Chinese people will soon end, this is a great miracle in the history of human development
 'vaise jinping ke bhaashan main vampanthi sarkaar or samaajwaad kaa zikr to tay tha, lekin samaajwaad kii duhai kaa prabhaav ab chini mulk main halkaa hota ja rahaa he
 In China emerging as an economic superpower, it is not right to say directly about the end of socialism, but China is not averse to making effective socialism
 asal samaajwaad nahin samaj paaya china?jawahar laal nehru vishvavidhyalay (JNU) ke professor esen malakar kaa kahana he ki asal samaajwaad or china ke samaajwaad donon main bada fark he
 Fundamental problems arise due to the fact that the country does not understand the definition of socialism and calls itself a socialist, then it is unable to test itself on its criteria
 samaajawaadee vyavastha main dhan-sampatti kaa swaamitv or vitaran samaaj ke niyantran ke adheen rahete hai
 The principle of socialism is based on the international proletariat
 samaajwaad ko rashtravaadi kavach banayounhone kaha ki china kabhi lenin ke samaajawaadee siddhanton par nahin chalaa
 When the revolution took place in 1949, he opposed a communist country like Russia
 iske baad hi china ne chini samaajwaad kaa nijaat kiya tha
 China insisted on socialism under the guise of nationalism and gradually it created a new definition by linking socialism with nationalist armor
 vahiin, 1990 main rus se samaajwaad saaf ho gaya
 China developed a close friendship with developed countries, followed by a tour of globalization
 nae globaligeshan kaa daur viksit desh laae the, jo washington concensus kaa hissaa he
 The capitalists of the world made a rule and imposed it on globalization, which is called new liberalism
 isamen china ne apni setting baithaani shuru kar di, gloligeshan khud samrajyavad kaa hatkandaa tha
 However, China showed an understanding that it prominently placed its conditions in the process of globalization
 isse sabase zyada phayda china ko hua
 China gradually occupied the market of all countries
 ab china par nakel kasne ke liye america raashtrapati donald trump nae tarah ke aayaat kar laga rahe hai
 25% of the economists had to open, SN Malakar said that due to globalization, China too had to open its market
 haalanki usne sirf 25 fisadi hi indstrelist jone ko kholaa he
 In the agricultural sector, its market is still considered closed
 25 fisadi khuli arthvyavastha ke boote china poonjivadi deshon se kamai kar rahaa he or isi vajah se nayaa varg bhi paidaa ho rahaa he, jo samaajwaad se duuri kii badi vajah he
 Socialism is a classless society
 haalanki china ne samajhadaari dikhaai he ki usne apana abhi 75 fisadi bazaar nahin kholaa he, jisase samaajwaad ko thaharne kaa vakt mil gaya he
 Capitalists do not take over in China
 Faslaprofessor SN Malakar explains that in China any decision is taken by the government there, the capitalists do not take decisions, the national wealth that is earned from the world is spent on the people there
 aise main ham kah sakate hai ki vahaan samaajwaad he, lekin mujhe nahin lagata ki china main bahut din tak samaajwaad rahegaa
 The biggest reason for this is the introduction of the class structure
 china main privet companiyaan bad rahi hai
 The Chinese government is providing them protection
 dhire-dhire in companiyon kaa dakhal krishi kshetra main bhi hona tay he
 This will increase class structure and end socialism
 kyon diya samaajawaadee bazaar kaa siddhant?professor esen malakar ne bataaya ki china aise mode par he ki use samaajawaadee desh nahin kaha ja saktaa
 That is why China itself gave a theory, which is called socialist market
 is siddhant ko vietnam bhi maanata he
 The nature of this market is that people who are at the top of the socialist system will have all kinds of development under their control
 jab kabhi uthal-puthal hogi (jais honkong or tiyanmen squaire main hua tha) to chini sarkaar piples librasion army ke jariye use krash karke control kar legi, lekin chini sarkaar isamen thodi riyaayat bhi detii rahati he taaki arthvyastha par prabhaav naa pade
 Professor Malakar said that China is holding both socialism and capitalism, whereas socialism in its structure itself is a staunch opponent of capitalism
 khayr duniya poonjivadiyon ke dabaav main he, aisi sthiti main china main bhi samaajwaad kaa lambey vakt tak tik paanaa mumkin nahin he
 Chinese leftist, SN Malakar, who does not provide knowledge on the Internet, said that capitalist ideology has not yet entered the Chinese army because the Chinese army has Communist Party members
 vahaan par communist party kaa member internet par gyaan nahin detaa he
 He is trained for about three years
 unhen duniya ke bare main bataaya jaataa he
 It is also kept in waiting for membership
 jab kisi desh kii army main thos vichaardhaara ho to uskaa upyog kabhi bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 The entire army of China is armed with nationalism and communist ideology
 aise main kahin bhi china main uthal-puthal (jais honkong or tiyanmen squaire main hua tha) hoti he to vahaan kii army control kar leti he
 However, dictatorship has also emerged, which is not part of socialism
 professor malakar ne kaha ki agar ham aaj soviet sangh or cuba vaala samaajwaad china main dhudhenge to yah bemaani hogi
 Chinese President Coming to India Tomorrow Chinese President Xi Jinping is visiting India on Friday for two days
 narendra modi ke duusari baar pradhanmantri banane ke baad chini raashtrapati kii yah pehali bharat yatra hogi
 However, there is no possibility of any major agreement between India and China in this two-day tour
 kyonki ye ek tarah kii informal visit he, jisamen koi nishchit agenda par baat nahin hogi

 vittamantri pi chidambaram ne desh main do-teen bade vishwastareey bainkon kii aavashyaktaa bataate hue kaha ki iske liye banking kshetra main thodaa-bahut vilay or ekikaran jaruri he
 He said at the conference 'bancon-2012' on banking sector, some integration is necessary to work in the new business environment
 hamen is tarah ke sudrudheekaran athwa ekikaran se darana nahin chahie
 i know that there is a question of pride and identity here, but after all there is some merger and integration in the banking system of this country
 unhone kaha, hamen kam se kam do-teen vaishvik aakaar ke bank banane honge
 China has done this and if India wants to be the third largest economy in the world and it will be so, then we should have at least two global size banks and little consolidation, integration in banks cannot be avoided
 tippaniyan Chidambaram said that when there is merger, integration between big banks, then there is also an opportunity for local area banks
 unhone kaha, darasal mujhe afsos he ki 1996 main shuru hui sthaneey kshetra bank kii pahal pehle teen license dene ke baad band ho gai

 President Pranab Mukherjee said in his address to the nation on the eve of Independence Day that corruption has become a problem that is making the country hollow
 unhone kaha ki is buraai kaa virodh jaij he lekin yah loktantric sansthaaon par akraman karne kaa bahaanaa nahin ban saktaa
 In his first address to the nation, Mukherjee said, "the anger against corruption spread around and opposition against this evil is justified, because it is hollowing out the capacity and power of our nation
" kabhi-kabhi log dhairya kho dete hai lekin yah hamaari loktantric sansthaaon par akraman kaa bahaanaa nahin ban saktaa
 " sanvaidhanik sansthaaon par aae din kiye ja rahe hamalon par raashtrapati ne kaha, "sansthaaen hamaare samvidhan ke dikhaai dene vaale aadhaar stambh hai or agar inamen daraar aati he to hamaare samvidhan kaa adarshavaad kaayam nahin rah paaegaa
 They are a medium to connect principles and people
 ho saktaa he ki hamaari sansthaaen samay ke saath puraani pad gai hon, parantu jo bana hua he, use nasht karnaa koi samaadhaan nahin he, iske bajaay hamen inhen is dhang se punarnirmit karnaa hoga taaki ye pehle se adhik majboot bane
 Institutions are the protectors of our freedom
 " The President acknowledged that the credibility of those areas of politics, judiciary, executive and legislature would have to be restored, where complacency, exhaustion or corruption is hindering the results
 unhone kaha ki logon ko apane asantosh ko vyakt karne kaa adhikaar he
 But we must also understand that law cannot be separated from legislature or justice from judiciary
 unhone kaha, "jab praadhikari nirankush ho jate hai to loktantr ko nuksaan pahunchataa he parantu jab virodh baar-baar hote hai tab ham avyavashtha ko nyauta dete hai
 Democracy is a shared process
 ham sabhi kii, jeet yaa haar saath-saath hoti he
 Democratic attitudes require dignified behavior and tolerating opposing views
 " Mukherjee said, “parliament will function on its own time and at its own pace
 kabhi-kabhi isaki gati asahaj lagati he; lekin loktantr main sadaiv ek nyaay kaa din, chunaav kaa din aata he
 "comments "main aisa chetavanee ke rup main nahin, balki is anurodh ke saath kah rahaa hum ki saadhaaran ghatnakramon ke peeche chhipe astitvvaadi muddon ko or achche dhang se samajha jaae
 In a democracy, the important institution of accountability has provided an unmatched opportunity to address grievances through free elections
 " Expressing concern over the violence in Assam in the past, Mukherjee said, "I am particularly pained to see violence in Assam
 hamaare alpsankhyakon ko santvanaa kii, sadbhaavna kii or aakraamakata se bachaae jane kii jarurat he
