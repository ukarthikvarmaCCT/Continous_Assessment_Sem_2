 Know how Sanjay Dutt's time will be spent in jail
 jamaane ke saamne rote-rote apane aansu khud pi gaya munna
 Standing in front of difficult times, ask for prayers for this, but now there is no hope for prayers
 koi jatan kaam nahin aayaa, naa aansu or naa hi duaen
 Now time has also started counting down with the ticking of the clock
 munna ne maan liya, ki mukaddar kaa likhaa koun taal saktaa he, naseeb main jail kii kaal kothri likhi he, to jail janaa hi padegaa
 As long as the fetters of the law are seated with Munna, how long would they turn their faces? munna ko 16 may kii subah us ghadi se saamana karnaa hi padegaa
 According to the legal provisions of the surrender, Sanjay Dutt must first surrender in the TADA Court of Mumbai
 16 may ko subah se lekar shaam chaar baje ke bich kabhi bhi sarender kar sakate hai sanjay dutt
 He will then be taken to Arthur Road Jail
 iske baad unhen maharashtra ke 6 main se kisi ek central jail main transfar kar diya jayega
 By the way, it is more likely that Sanjay Dutt will be shifted to Yerwada Jail in Pune
 pune kii is aitihaasik jail main sanjay dutt do maheene kii kaid kaat chuke hai
 Sanjay Dutt is fully aware of the atmosphere here
 haalanki is baat se koi khaas fark nahin padataa, kyonki jail to jail hi he
 Sanjay Dutt will have to go through all the strict provisions which have been imposed with his sentence
 jab munnabhai jaaenge jail to sabase pehle sanjay dutt kaa medical test hoga
 Uniform and prisoner number will be available after the medical test
 aam kaidiyon kaa khaanaa milegaa, kapade khud dhonaa hoga
 Wake up at 7 in the morning and work for 5 hours
 sanjay dutt apni marji se koi bhi kaam chun sakate hai
 According to the jail authorities, when Sanjay Dutt came to jail last time, he had chosen to weave chairs
 unhone lakadiyon ke kaam main behad dilchaspee dikhaayi thi
 This time Sanjay Dutt chooses which job in jail
 jail main kaam ke rup main sanjay dutt ke saamne jo vikalp he usamen vah rasoi ghar main kaam kar sakate hai
 They can also find work in the jail bakery
 jail main bagwani kaa kaam kar sakate hai
 Spinning can be done by spinning yarn
 lohe yaa lakdi kaa kaam kar sakate hai
 In prison, skilled labor gets Rs 40, semi-skilled Rs 35 and untrained labor only Rs 25
 karodon kii kamai or lakhon ke kharch ke aadi sanjay dutt ko 40 rupee main guzaara karnaa hoga
 However, according to the new jail manual, he will get a maximum of Rs 1500 from the family
 in paison se sanjay dutt jail kii canteen se khaane pine kii koi cheez kharid sakate hai
 Sanjay Dutt can also be released on parole of 30 to 60 days during his three and a half year jail
 is bich unhen parivaar ke paanch sadasyon se maheene main ek baar milane kii ijaajat hogi, lekin wo mulaakaat sirf 20 minute kii hogi
 This is the real story of Munnabhai's real life in films
 purushon or mahilaon kii maut kaa ek mukhya kaaran fefdon kaa cancer bhi hota ja rahaa he
 Despite the rapid increase in the number of cases of this disease due to smoking during the last half century, the younger generation is not becoming conscious and is increasingly under the grip of smoking
 visheshgyon kaa kahana he ki cancer se hone vaali maut ke 90 fisadi maamalon kaa kaaran dhumrapaan hota he
 Lung cancer cases are higher than the combined figures of deaths from other types of cancer such as colorectal cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer
 onchologist dow e
 K
 anand kehete hai ‘‘aamtaur par fefdon kaa cancer 45 saal kii umr ke baad hota he
 But as the trend of smoking in youth is increasing, in view of this, this disease is holding them at an early age
 iske lakshanon kii ore aksar yuva dhyaan nahin dete or jab tak ilaaj ke liye pahunchate hai, tab tak bahut der ho chuki hoti he
 '' Oncologist Dr
 P
 pi
 Channa says, "quitting smoking reduces the risk of lung cancer, but does not end
" har saal 40 fisadi nae maamle saamne aate hai or pehle ke maamalon kaa ilaaj to chalata hi rahata he
 It is a cause of grave concern for the younger generation to suffer from this disease because they not only have their family, but also the future of society and country
 ’’dow anand kehete hai, ‘‘iske lakshanon main khaansee aana, thand laganaa, bhukh khatm ho janaa, neend na aana se lekar munh se khun nikalnaa tak shaamil he
 But people do not take the initial four symptoms seriously
 dhumrapaan karne vaale yah bhi nahin sochate ki unke ghar main unke bachche, patni, mata pita, unke mitra or aasapaas se guzarane vaale ve log tak is beemaari ke shikaar ho sakate hai jo swayan dhumrapaan nahin karte
 '' The report says that 6 of these
 9 karod log dhumrapaan karte hai, 16
 3 crore people eat other tobacco products and 4
 2 karod log donon tarah ke tambaakoo kaa seven karte hai
 a person addicted to smoking smokes an average of six cigarettes or 11 bidis daily
 isi ke chalate bharat tambaakoo seven ke maamle main vishwa kaa doosraa sabase bada desh he
 Dr
 sirohi kahati hai, ‘‘shaharon main swasthya sevaaon kii uplabdhta ke chalate is beemaari kaa pataa chal jaataa he, lekin gaanvon main log isse anbhigya rahete hai or vahaan samuchit swasthya suvidhaayen bhi nahin hai
 Therefore, cases of lung cancer are either undetected or go on very late
 ’’ vah kahati hai ‘‘sarkaar ko chahie ki is beemaari se yuvaaon ko bachaane ke liye celibrities kii madad se jaagarukta abhiyaan chalaae, kyonki unki apil kaa yuvaaon par asar jarur hoga
 The ban on smoking in public areas has not been of much benefit
 ’’ The 32-year-old man, who had attacked and molested at least 25 minors since April last year in the western part of Mumbai, was arrested from Khar area
 police ne bataaya ki ek aankh vaale aaropee ayaaj mohammad ali ansaari ke khilaaf juhu, santakruj, dien nagar, amboli, varsova, sayan, vacola, aareke maarg or antop hill ilaakon main 13 exiaar darj hai

 Out of that, 13 cases have been reported in different police stations
 pakistan or srilanka ke bich series kaa teesraa vanade colombo main ravivaar ko khelaa jayega
 In the 5 match ODI series, both the teams currently have one win each and the series is on par
 aise main pakistan or srilanka kii koshish tisare vanade main jeet hasil kar series main badhat lene par hogi
 In Colombo, Pakistan will also face a challenge to deal with the ICC ban on Mohammad Hafeez
 srilankai pichon par spinner kii bhoomika ahm he ye pehle vanade main sabit ho chukaa he
 In the first ODI, Hafeez took 4 wickets for 41 runs, due to which Pakistan won by 6 wickets
 isisi ke bain ke baad pakistan ko srilankai ballebaazon ko rokane ke nae upaay talashne honge
 Before the match, Sri Lankan captain Angelo Mathews said, "it will be difficult for Pakistan, yet we cannot take the opposing team lightly
" ' If you talk about ICC rankings, Pakistan is at number 9 in the current rankings
 champions trophy main qualifaai karne ke liye pakistan ko har haal main series jeetna hoga
 Pakistan performed very well in the first ODI
 ballebaazon or gendbaazon ne milakar team ko jeet dilaai, lekin duusare vanade main team patari se utar gai
 Captain Azhar Ali, Shoaib Malik and Mohammad Rizwan scored runs on the scoreboard with a half-century but the bowlers failed to stop the run
 duusari taraf srilanka ke liye kusal perera kaa shandaar form main hona kisi vardaan se kam nahin he
 Perera impressed everyone in the second ODI by scoring a fast half-century off just 17 balls
 captain maitheus ko aage bhi perera se dhamaakedaar pari kii ummid rahegi
 If there is any problem for Sri Lanka, then it is the form of the team's middle order batsmen
 opebers sahi shuruyaat de rahe hai lekin medil order ko pari sanbhale kaa anubhav nahin he
 Since the retirement of Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene, the team has found a solution to this problem
 iske alaava srilankai khilaadi field main sust hai jo captain bhi sweekaar kar chuke hai
 The batsmen and bowlers combined to win the team, but in the second ODI the team derailed
 captain azhar ali, shoeb malik or mohammad rigwaan ne ardhshtak banaakar scoreboard par ran batore lekin gendbaaz ran rokane main naakaam rahe
 On the other hand, for Sri Lanka, Kusal Perera is in no good boon
 perera ne duusare vanade main sirf 17 gend par tej ardhshtak banaakar sabko prabhavit kiya
 Captain Matthews will also expect a banging innings from Perera
 srilanka ke liye agar koi pareshaani kii baat he to wo he team ke medil order ballebzon kaa form
 The openers are giving a good start but the middle order is not experienced in the innings
 kumaar sangakara or mahela jayavardhane ke sanyas ke baad se team ko is samasya kaa hal nikaala zaruri ho gaya he
 Also Sri Lankan players are sluggish in the field which has also been accepted by the captain

 On 6 June, when the Meteorological Department had announced the arrival of monsoon to Kerala, everyone expected that the monsoon would finally arrive soon
 mausam vibhaag ne monsoon ke kerala pahunchane kii ghoshnaa kar to di, lekin 6 june ke baad monsoon aage badha hi nahin
 Like every time, this time also the meteorological department is lying to hide the bad monsoon
 kerala pahunche hue do din ho chuke hai lekin monsoon ek inch bhi aage nahin badha
 The Meteorological Department may have been producing false rains but the fact is that the monsoon situation is very bad at the moment
 6 june ke baad kerala main monsoon jaisi barish to katai nahin ho rahi he
 The trend of rain is being seen in the area of western Ghats and that too is just 1 cm to 4 cm
 jo ki is ilaake main bahut aam baat he
 It is estimated that the possibility of adverse conditions for the monsoon has increased

 If this happens then this cyclone will go towards Oman

 But this region of low pressure created in the Arabian Sea has curbed the speed of monsoon
 agar cyclone bana to monsoon dobaaraa jor pakadaney main kam se kam hafte bhar kaa samay laga degaa
 That is, there is a tremendous threat on the monsoon and its pace has stopped
 gauratlab he ki is baar monsoon ke saamaanya se kam rahane kii bhavishyavaanee mausam vibhaag pehle hi kar chukaa he
 According to this estimate, the average amount of rainfall in the monsoon season can be 95 percent in the long term
 jaankaron kaa kahana he ki monsoon kii barish kamjor rahane kii ashanka ke peeche prashanth mahaasaagar main ban rahe al nino kaa haath he

 jab abhinetri tanushri datta ne kareeb ek dashak pehle horn oke plis film ke set par naanaa patekar se hue apane kathith yon utpeeda kii bharatiyon ko yaad dilaai, to bollywood ke peshewaron ne apni pratikriya # metoo se nahin, balki # ibelieveher ke rup main di
 This hashtag is a proof that Bollywood is far behind in setting precedent like Hollywood
 hollywood main aise hi maamle main puraa bavaal khadaa ho gaya or produsar harvey vinstin, abhinayta kevin spacy, kamedian bill cosby jaise kai sitaron ko janata or manoranjan udyog kaa samarthan milanaa band ho gaya or unhen kanoonee karrwai kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Datta's story began to get a buzz when Janis Sequera, who was a reporter until Aaj Tak and Headlines Today, confirmed her statement and was also supported by Shiney Shetty, assistant director of the film
 iske baad priyanka chopra, farhaan akhtar, sonam kapur, swara bhaskar ne bhi datta kaa samarthan kiya
 Despite these comments, it seems that Bollywood has taken signature silence
 yahaan na koi # timesup andolan hoga or celebrity na hi kisi aword sho main peediton ke prati ekajutata dikhaane ke liye kaale kapadon main aaenge
 For veterans like Amitabh Bachchan of the film world, silence is the ultimate happiness

 His faint response was, "neither my name is Tanushree nor Nana Patekar

 in sabase mahila shashaktikaran par filmein banane kaa hamaara makasad khokhla sabit hota he
 Tandon's attack on Bollywood's duplicity is just right
 datta ke aawaaj uthaane ke baad film nirmaataa or koreographer farh khan ne instagram par ek photo share kiya, jisamen unke bhai sajid ke nirdesan main aane vaali film housephul 4 ke kalakaar dikh rahe hai
 There is also Nana Patekar in it
 tvinkal khanna ne datta ko apana samarthan diya, par unke pati akshay kumaar isi film main patekar ke saath kaam kar rahe hai
 Actors like Renuka Shahane admitted that many men and women have been subjected to Nana Patekar's anger, but no appeals like Patekar's boycott have come to light
 sajaa to dur kii baat he, film industry hinsak yaa kharaab bartaav karne vaale mardon ko fatkaar lagane kii bhi icchhuk nahin rahi he
 In 2002, Aishwarya Rai refused to work with her ex-boyfriend Salman Khan in a sentimental statement, "for his own good, for his understanding
" '' aishwarya ne kaha tha ki do saal ke rishte main unhone salmaan ke zyada sharaab pine kii aadat or unke 'shabdic, shaareerik or maansik' durvyavhaar ko sahan kiya he
 Despite this, Salman remained practically impeccable
 datta ko yah kahkar hatotsahit or badnaam kiya ja rahaa he ki america se lautne ke baad ve publicity ke liye yah sab kar rahi hai
 They currently settle in the US
 datta baagi hai or karrwai kii maang kar rahi hai, jisaki vajah se unke aalochakon kaa gussa bad rahaa he
 Bollywood does not seem to want any solution to this problem

 Last year, a woman assistant accused Vikas Bahl of molesting her

 Will Dutta get a second chance? Will anyone go ahead and help rebuild their career, which has exposed the industry's dirty secrets? "silence has become an option," says Richa Chadha

 ' In an interview to Shiv Sena mouthpiece Saamna, the party chief Uddhav said that the Shiv Sena has rotten in the last 25 years of alliance

 The encounter involves Uddhav Thackeray's interview

 " manmohan singh ke vipareet narendra modi ko ‘accidental piem’ (sanyog se pradhanmantri) to katai nahin kaha ja saktaa
 What could have been better than his rise
 bijepi ne unhen sitambar 2013 ke madhya main hi pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar ghoshit kar diya tha
 Such a six-month wide campaign has never been seen in the country before
 7 april se 12 may ke bich 36 dinon ke 16veen loksabhaa ke liye nau charnon ke matdaan ke prachaar main modi ne 3,00,000 kilometre se zyada kaa safar kiya, kareeb 430 reliyon ko sambodhit kiya or kareeb 5,800 saarvajanik aayojanon main shaamil hue
 The focus of publicity was on the promise of good governance and development
 janadesh bhi endie or modi ke liye bharpoor vishwaas mat kii tarah aayaa
 With this, the history of several hung mandates has been broken continuously
 bijepi ko akele 282 siten hasil huin or sarkaar chalaane kaa purna bahumat mil gaya
 The last time any party got a full mandate was in Congress three decades ago in 1984
 yah janadesh desh ke rajnatik chayan ke itihaas main nirvivaad parivartan jaisaa he
 BJP gets 31
 5 pratishat vot uske itihaas main sabase adhik hai or 19
 The Congress' vote share with 6 percent is the lowest in its history
 ascharyajanak rup se yah 2009 main bijepi ke vot pratishat ke baraabar hi he
 The trend of votes against the Congress (9 per cent) is also the same as seen against him during 1971 to 1977, and 1984 to 1989
 lekin is baar pehle se hi kamatar aadhaar ne use 20 pratishat se bhi neeche pahunchaa diya
 This made it difficult for the party to convert the votes received into seats
 bijepi ke paksh main 12
 The 7 per cent trend was also unexpected in the country's electoral history
 yah 1989 or 1991 ke daur main bijepi ke prati bane rujhaan se dedh guna zyada he or isi se ‘modi lahar’ kii baat main dam dikhne laga
 The only reason for the nda's victory is the bjp's excellent performance
 haalanki endie main bijepi ke sahyogi dal apane dam par maamuli vot hissedari badha paae, lekin unki siten 25 se doguni badhkar 53 tak pahunch gayi
 The Congress got only 44 seats in the 16th Lok Sabha, which is just one eighth of the 404 seats Rahul Gandhi's father Rajiv Gandhi got in the Indira massacre (1984)
 yah endie ke pehali baar satta main aane ke samay congress kii 114 siton se bhi kaaphi kam he
 So, the Congress Parliamentary Party leader will not even get the recognition of the Leader of the Opposition according to the Constitution because of getting less than 10 percent of the total seats! Delhi, Uttarakhand, Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh) and West (chhattisgarh, Goa, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra) had unexpected gains of seats
 uttar se 101 siten judakar 14 se 115 ho gayi, jabaki pashchim ne atirikt 45 siten dekar taadaad 61 se 106 kar di
 In Uttar Pradesh, Mayawati's Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) did not get a single seat whereas in 2009 it got 20 seats
 mulaayam singh yadav kii samaajawaadee party (sapa) ghatakar paanch par aa gai or congress ko sirf sonia gandhi tathaa rahul gandhi kii do siten hi milin
 Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) won a landslide victory in the 2013 Delhi Assembly elections but this time it was seen as a threat to the BJP, especially in the urban centers of Delhi and Varanasi
 varanasi se modi chunaav lard rahe the
 You probably had to bear the brunt of leaving the government in Delhi in 49 days and some upsets
 use sirf punjab main chaar siten milin
 In the east (odisha, Assam, Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal), NDA also got a good lead
 in rajyon main uski siten 25 se badhkar 53 ho gayi
 Reaching the first 12 to 31 seats in Bihar is especially important because Nitish Kumar's 17-year alliance with the JD (U) was broken
 uske baad kuch bhi chamatkaar nahin ho sakaa
 BJP has crossed its milestone on the basis of Modi wave but JD (U) has lost its leadership, Lalu Prasad Yadav's RJD got only four seats which is same as in 2009
 pashchim bengal main sipiem khiskkar sirf do siton par aa gai or 22
 Only 7 per cent votes were reduced
 use 2009 main nau siten or 33
 1 percent votes were received
 is baar kerala ke nattejey bhi anukool na hone se sipiem ke loksabhaa main bas 9 sadsy hi rah gaye hai
 (who chose BJP) Mamata Banerjee's Trinamool Congress has strengthened its hold over West Bengal with 34 (up from 19) seats and began to look like the Left Front in the 1980s
 vahaan is party ne joardaar tareeke se dastak de di he
 There is good news for BJP too
 bhagava party ne vahaan apana vot pratishat 6
 16 more than doubled from 1
 9 fisadi kar liya he
 Perhaps it is poised to become the main opposition party in the state
 dakshin main (andhra pradesh, karnataka, kerala or tamilnadu) bijepi ne karnataka main apana ghaataa do par hi roak liya or andhra main chandra babu naidu ke saath gathjod karke 13 siton kaa phayda kar liya
 In Tamil Nadu, the dmk's seats, which were battered by the 2G scam and family feud, declined from 18 to zero
 haalanki uskaa vot pratishat 25
 1 to 23
 3 par aakar maamuli-sa hi gira
 J
 jayalalita kii eiediemke tamilnadu kii 39 main se 37 siten hathiyaa le gai
 Its performance has been better, and as usual, the people of Tamil Nadu have given unilateral results to only one party
 sanket yah mil rahe hai ki congress ne apana muslim or sikh vot bank to banaae rakhaa he lekin hinduon ke sabhi virgon main (7 se 9 fisadi) samarthan ganvaa chuki he
 BJP has increased its popularity among Muslims by around 9%
 bijepi ke ‘saskruthik sadbhaav’ or ‘vikaas ke agenda’ kaa daanv shaayad anusuchit jatiyon (essi) or janajatiyon (asti) ke sir chadhakar bolaa he
 Probably 17 to 20 percent of sc-sts voted for him
 (congress kyon hui dharashayi)aayu varg kii baat karen to isamen congress 25 saal se kam umr ke yuvaaon main apana aadhaar kaayam rakh pai he jabaki madhya or usase adhik aayu ke logon main 5-7 fisadi tak aakarshan khoti lag rahi he
 On the other hand, BJP seems to be gaining grip in all age groups (it has gained 11-18 percent)
 bijepi kii lokapriyata sabase zyada yuvaaon main he or iskaa nuksaan congress ke alaava duusari partiyon ko hota lag rahaa he
 The bjp's road, electricity and water agenda may have brought in additional votes from the vocal middle class with the agenda of bread, cloth and house of the Congress
 matdaan main langik rujhaan ke fark kaa koi sanket nahin he
 Both men and women have an inclination towards the BJP
 aay, shiksha, jati, ling or umr ke vibhinn virgon ke vot rujhaan main fark nahin dikhaa he

 The Bahujan Samaj Party (gautam Budh Nagar, Ghaziabad, meerut-hapur, Bulandshahar, Agra, Fatehpur Sikri, Saharanpur, Amroha, Bijnor, Nagina and Aligarh) will contest elections on 11 seats
 jabaki 8 siton par samaajawaadee party (hathras, kairana, muradabad, sanbhal, rampur, mainpuri, firozabad or eta) or baaki kii 3 siten rashtriya lok dal (bagpat, mujffarnagar or mathura) ke hisse main gai he
 The Rashtriya Lok Dal has entered the SP-BSP alliance as the third party
 sapa-basapa gathbandhan ne ralod ko pehle 2 siten dene kii baat kahi thi, jis par ajit singh raji nahin the
 They were continuously demanding four seats
 isko lekar buudhvaar ko ralod netaa jayant choudhary or sapa adhyaksh akhilesh yadav ke saath lakhanu main baithak hui thi
 During this time, the seat sharing formula was decided, in which RLD has been decided to give Baghpat, Mathura and Muzaffarnagar seats
 is tarah se ralod ko teesri seat sapa ko apane cote se deni hogi
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi has handed over the command of Western Uttar Pradesh to Jyotiraditya Scindia
 sindhiya ne abhi siton ke bantwaare par koi bayaan nahin diya he par congress mahaan dal ke netaa kaishav dev maurya se gathbandhan kar yah ishaara diya he ki congress bhi taiyaari main peeche nahin he

 But this time the saffron camp is troubled by the envy of youth and farmers, the coming together of Muslim-unspoken votes, the opposition siege and the internal arrogance within the BJP
 pashchimi uttar pradesh ke mukhya loksabhaa siton akalan karne par bhaajapa pehle payadan par rahi, lekin sapa-basapa ko 2014 loksabhaa chunaav main bahut kam haashie se haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa
 In order to understand the data easily, the figures of the 2014 Lok Sabha elections of the main Lok Sabha seats have been looked at separately
 meerut loksabhaa kshetra main bhaajapa ko 47
 BSP got 86 percent vote share, BSP got 27 percent vote share, SP got 19

 Got 85 percent vote share

 sp's vote share 26
 51 fisadi or basapa kaa vot share 21
 70 per cent which is 48 in total
 21 fisadi bhaajapa ke vot share 2
 Was 27 percent higher
 saharanpur loksabhaa kshetra main bhaajapa ne jeet to darj kii, lekin vipakshi dalo bhi bahut kam antar se peeche rahe
 bjp's vote share 39
 59 fisadi rahaa congress kaa vot share 34
 Was 14 percent
 basapa vot share 19
 67 stayed and SP 4
 42 fisadi vot share par hi simat gai
 BJP 56 in Ghaziabad Lok Sabha constituency
 50 fisadi vot share ke saath apana paracham laharaaya or congress 14
 24% vote share, BSP 12
 89 fisadi vot share or sapa 7
 Tasted the defeat of 97 percent vote share
 pashchimi uttar pradesh main sapa-basapa aupchaarik tor par gathbandhan or siton kaa elaan kar chuki he jo bhaajapa ko 2019 loksabhaa chunaav main kadi chunauti de saktaa he kyoki bhaajapa ke paas 2014 loksabhaa chunaav main 80 main se 71 siten (vartmaan main 68 siten) he
 The BJP lost its 3 Lok Sabha seats in 2018 due to the Phulpur, Kairana and Gorakhpur coalition and according to the 2014 Lok Sabha election data, the total votes of both the SP-BSP were either ahead of the BJP or lost by a very small margin

 ham kaise khilakhilaa kar hansaa karte the
 
 
 How we used to laugh in our stomach
 kaise ham apane doston or chote bhai-bahanon ko gudagudi kiya karte the
 We grew older with the passage of time, but never noticed why we get tickles, and that too in certain parts of the body
 aakhir kin vajahon se kisi ke pet par chune se gudagudi hoti he magar sir par chune se kuch nahin hota
 After all, what is the science behind the tickle? Scientists say that if we laugh we are also on some jokes or jokes, but there is something else about the tickle
 yahaan maamla skin or chhuan kaa he
 The outermost layer of the skin is called the epidermis
 epidermis kai nason se swat: judaa hota he
 In a state of provocation, it connects to two parts of the brain
 ek jo chhuan kaa analysis karata he or doosraa jo aanandadaayi chizon kaa regulation karata he
 In general, a person has more tickling in places that are less and less surrounded by bone (the soles of the abdomen and feet)
 scientist maanate hai ki gudagudi khud ko surakshit rakhane kiprakriyaahai
 By doing this the body shrinks and the body comes in at least external contact
 kya insaan khud ko gudagudi kar saktaa he?yah ek saamaanya sawaal he jo aksar logon ke jehan main aata he
 We use all those tricks on ourselves after tickling others, but alas we do not feel the same way
 darasal, gudagudi sarprise kaa maamla he or ek insaan khud kosarpricenheen kar saktaa
 Our mind already knows that we are going to tickle ourselves
 ham kya harakatein karenge vagairah-vagairah
 If you try to tickle yourself in spite of this, then there will be something else instead of tickling
 haalanki apane hi haathon main kisi pankh ko lekar skin par phiraane se aap khud ko gudguda sakate hai
 But it rarely happens that you become laughable

 The article said that even though the Congress leadership is not free of charges about the 1984 riots, it kept itself apart from the frenzied crowd during the riots, but Narendra Modi was 'silent mob friends' during the 2002 riots
 Proved to be

 On this issue, Junagadh Deputy Collector RG Jadeja says that the Gujarat Panchayat Act has recently been amended by the state government, under which those who do not have toilets in their house, they cannot contest local bodies elections, and Lakhabhai's form is the same rule
 Is canceled under
 tippaniyan On the other hand, Lakhabhai says that his house falls in the forest of the Geer Sanctuary area, known as 'the only home of the Asiatic lions', where according to the rules, he does not dig any kind of concrete and construct any concrete

 jab kisaanon ne kagajaat par hastakshar karne se inkaar kar diya, to unki jameen par jabaran kabja kar liya gaya
 Alahasan, the then Zonal Officer (CO) of Rampur, misused his official position to grab the land of the poor
 tathyon kii pushti hone ke baad hamane ajam khan ke khilaaf ek aapraadhik maamla darj kiya he
 The case against the SP leader was registered on the basis of an investigation by the Revenue Department of Uttar Pradesh, in which all relevant documents were examined and statements of farmers, which are mainly from the minority community, were recorded
 rampur jile ke police pramukh ne kaha, 'rajasav vibhaag kii mukhya shikaayat ke aadhaar par ajam khan ke khilaaf 26 alag-alag maamle darj kiye jaaenge, kyonki isamen jameen ke alag-alag hisse or alag-alag maalik shaamil hai
 Asked if Azam Khan could be arrested, Sharma said, "it can happen at any time
" jaanch jari he
 'the FIR related to the case (FIR) states that apart from grabbing the land of farmers, Azam Khan as a cabinet minister for illegal possession of more than 5,000 hectares of land along the Kosi river between 2012 and 2017 Also misused his position
 ek rajasav adhikari ne kaha, 'rajasav record kathith rup se jaali the or kai sau karod rupee kii jameen par avaidh rup se mohammad johar ali vishvavidhyalay dwaara kabja kar liya gaya
 According to the Revenue Officer, there is strong evidence against Azam Khan for resorting to fake documents to fraudulently seize land along the river
 ajam khan ke dream project, mohammad ali johar vishvavidhyalay kii pariklpana 2004 main ek nijee urdu vishvavidhyalay ke rup main kii gai thi
 Construction of the university campus started rapidly after SP came to power in Uttar Pradesh
 saal 2012 main, akhilesh yadav sarkaar ne ajam khan ko vishvavidhyalay kaa aaajeevan kuladhipati banaae jane ko manjuuri di thi
 The move was opposed by the Governor of Uttar Pradesh

 In cases of land grabbing, Azam Khan tried to contact him to get a statement, but he could not be contacted

 The bugle for the Lok Sabha elections is over
 sabhi raajnneetik dal puri tarah se chunavi jang kii taiyaariyon main jute gaye hai
 If all the surveys that have come up till now are believed, then this time no party is getting clear majority
 ek or survey ke mutabik rashtriya janatantric gathbandhan (NDA) loksabhaa chunaav main bahumat se thodaa dur rahegaa, lekin gathbandhan ke jariye behad aasaani se sarkaar bana legaa
 The survey has given 264 seats to the NDA, while the UPA is expected to get 141 seats
 iske alaava anya dalon ko 138 siten milane kaa anumaan he
 At the same time, if there is no Grand Alliance in UP, then NDA will get 307 seats and UPA will have to be satisfied with just 139 seats
 iske alaava anya dalon ke khate main 97 siten ja sakati hai
 According to the latest survey conducted by c-voter for IANS, the outline of the next Lok Sabha will be determined on the basis of victory in UP

 The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) hopes that through this wave, it will defeat the opposition in the Lok Sabha elections
 survey main bhi is baat kii pushti hui ki narendra modi pradhanmantri pad ke pasandida ummidavaar kii daud main sabase aage hai
 If we talk only about BJP, then in this election it can get 220 seats and its alliance partners 44 seats
 agar endie mizo neshnal front (MNF), wiesar congress, telugana raashtra samiti (TRS) or biju janata dal (BJD) se chunaav baad gathbandhan karata he, to uski siton kii sankhya 301 ho jaaegi
 At the same time, Congress is likely to win 86 seats and its allies can get 55 seats
 upie agar chunaav baad gathbandhan karata he or isamen vam loktantric morcha (LDF), akhil bhartiya sanyukt loktantric morcha (AIUDF), trinmul congress (TMC), upi gathbandhan shaamil hoti hai, to siton kaa kul aankada 226 pahunch jayega
 According to the survey, if there is a mahagathbandhan in UP, then BJP can be reduced from 71 to 29 seats
 mahagathbandhan nahin hone kii sthiti main bijepi 2014 ke nateezon ko doharaa sakati he or 72 siton par kabja kar sakati he
 BJP can get the maximum 36 seats from Bihar

 Osama bin Laden is the biggest puzzle of the world war against terrorism, whether he is alive or dead

 No signs of bin Laden's existence have been found since 2003, according to the US intelligence agency CIA

 The news of inviting Congress President Ahul Gandhi at the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) event held at Vigyan Bhawan from September 17 to 19 made a lot of headlines
 saath hi aresas ke mukhar virdohi congress netadigvijay singhorajayram rameshko bhi aamantrit kiye jane kii khabaren saamne ain
 Such news has become a lot of media headlines for the past fortnight, according to sources in the RSS
 nyote kii khabar aane par shuruyaat main congress ne sadhi hui pratikriya di
 The party said that when the invitation comes, we will react to it
 aakhir party ko laga ki sonia gandhi ke adhyaksh rahete aresas ne unhen ek kaarykram kaa nyotaa bheja tha
 So maybe send this time too
 haalanki tab sonia ne sangh ko vighatnkaaree bataate hue nyotaa asweekaar kar diya tha
 But finally on September 14, two days before the event, when the news of the invitation came again, the media in-charge of Congress, Randeep Singh Surjewala, contacted Rahul Gandhi's office before he was confronted with the media
 puri chaanbin karne ke baad rahul gandhi ke daftar ne bataaya ki congress adhyaksh ke paas koi nyotaa nahin aayaa he
 Subsequently, Surjewala told the media that a false rumor of invitation was being spread for the last few days, while no such invitation has come
 saath hi surajevaala ne joda ki aresas kaa nyotaa koi gold medal nahin he
 rss's thinking is disruptive, they all know
 darasal, is bayaan ke zariye surajevaala ne ek tir se do nishane saadhe
 One kept the talk of not being invited, even attacked the RSS, and even if the invitation came, even hinted at Rahul Gandhi not going
 vaise dilachasp sirf rahul gandhi ko nyotaa aane kaa nahin he, balki party netaa digvijay singh se jab 'ajtak' ne nyote ke bare main poocha to unhone do took kaha ki unhen koi nimantran nahin aayaa he
 At the same time, Digvijay Singh said that it is another lie that came out of the factory of lies
 congress ke varisht netaa jairam ramesh ne bhi aresas kaa koi nyotaa milane se inkaar kiya he

 US President Donald Trump, in his annual State of the Union address on Wednesday, called on Congress to reject the politics of revenge, resistance and retaliation, as well as insisting on building a wall along the us-mexico border
 sulah ke liye unki apil par democrates ne koi pratikriya nahin di
 The opposition strongly opposes Trump's agenda and accuses them of showing haste in rejecting all-party cooperation
 raashtrapati or democrate saansadon ke bich seemaa par diwaar banane ke vivaadit prastaav ko lekar record 35 din tak gatirodh chalaa
 The government functioning was partially halted due to the deadlock
 is kaaran trump kaa sambodhan bhi sthagit karnaa padaa
 The address was earlier scheduled to be held on 29 January
 gatirodh ke dauraan democratic party kaa netritv sadan kii adhyaksh nancy pelocy kar rahi thim
 Trump said in Congress at the beginning of the State of Union address, "we must reject the politics of revenge, resistance and retaliation
" ' unhone daawa kiya ki vah apane sambodhan main america kaa agenda pesh kar rahe hai
 The President said, "an economic miracle is happening in America and the only thing that can stop it is stupid war, politics or ridiculous partisan investigation
 ' unhone kaha ki avaidh pravaasiyon ko bardaasht karnaa dayaa nahin he balki yah krurta he
 He said, "the state of chaos on our southern border is a threat to the security and financial condition of all Americans
" apane nagarikon kii jindagiyon or naukariyon kii raksha karne vaali ek avrajan pranali bananaa hamaara naitik kartavya he
 'trump said,' This includes our duty to the millions of migrants living here today who follow our rules and respect the laws
 vaid pravaasiyon se anginat tareekon se hamaara raashtra samrudh banataa he or hamaara samaaj majboot hota he
 "it's time to show the world that America is committed to stopping illegal migrants, drug smugglers and human traffickers," he said
 '
 In addition, US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that he would hold a second summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Vietnam in late February
 yah shikhar vaarta 27-28 farvari ko hogi

 In his annual 'state of Union' address, Trump said his administration's efforts to establish peace in the Korean Peninsula had progressed
 gorakshakon kii mob linching se50log or baccha chori kii afvaahon se30logon kii hatya ke baad,supreme court ne do saal puraane maamle main ab45pej kaa faisla dete hue preventive,sudharatmak or dandatmak kadamon kii baat kahi he
 Intentional or non-willful murder by a person, group or mob is a crime under the Indian Penal Code, ie, the IPC, instead of ensuring strict adherence to how effective the new Supreme Court guidelines will be
 
 
 ?supreme court ke disha-nirdesh,puraani bottle main nai sharaab :supreme court ne guideline jari karte hue kaha he ki mob linching kii ghatana hone par turantavbaish,jald jaanch or chargeshit,chah maheene main mukademe kaa trial,aparaadhiyon ko adhiktam sazaa,gavaahon kii suraksha,laaparvaah pulicekarmiyon ke viruddh karrwai,peediton ko twarit muaavze jaise kadam rajyon dwaara uthaae jaaen
 The Supreme Court has given many decisions on all these subjects in the past, which the imposition of mob lynching offenders does not encourage
 nai guidelinon se peedit paksh ko raahat shaayad hi mili,haa,adhikariyon ke kaagaj-pattar or meetingon kaa silsilaa bad jayega
 How will the misuse of laws like Masuka stop: If the Human Security Law (masuka) is introduced on the lines of the National Security Act (rasuka) to prevent incidents like mob lynching, it can cause many harm
 raajnneetik sangrakshan kii vajah se kashmir ghati main patharbaajon or haryana main jat andolan ke updraviyon ke viruddh darj maamle waapas ho jate hai
 On the other hand, if the Masuka law is implemented in cases like mob lynching, its misuse will increase the scope of trapping innocent people
 sansad dwaara nae kanoon ke naam par maamle ko taalna :supreme court ne kaha he ki mob linching ko pruthak aparaadh banane ke liye sansad dwaara nayaa kanoon banaaya janaa chahie
 Sections 302, 304, 307, 308, 323, 325, 34, 120-B, 141 and 147-149 of the IPC and sections 129 and 153 of the CRPC have adequate provisions for such offenses
 inhen lagu karne kii bajaay sansad dwaara nayaa kanoon laane se jamini halaat main kaise sudhaar hoga
 
 
 No police action due to the patronage of political parties: It is clear from the conduct of Union Minister Jayant Sinha that the guardians of the guard or mob lynching get protection of the leaders, then how to take police action
 
 
 ?aise ghrunit aparaadhon ko sangrakshan de rahe netaaon ko chunaav ke ayogy ghoshit karte hue,unke viruddh sakht aapraadhik karrwai yadi kii jaae,to phir chhutbhaiye netaaon kii mob linching kii dukaan khud-ba-khud band ho jaaegi
 Why not take contempt action against leaders instead of states: On September 6, 2017, the Supreme Court ordered the states to stop mob lynching on the petition of Tushar Gandhi, grandson of Mahatma Gandhi
 haryana,rajasthan or uttar pradesh jaise rajyon dwaara supreme court ke aadesh kaa paalan nahin karne kii vajah se,unke khilaaf avmaananaa kaa notice jari kiya gaya he,jis par agle maheene sunwaayee hogi
 Mob lynching has become an organized industry under the patronage of leaders, instead of taking concrete action against them, what would be gained from contempt notices against the states
 
 
 ?whotsap ke liye bharat main shikaayat adhikari kii niyukti kyon nahin :iti act ke tahat intermediri niyamon ke anusaar internet or soshal media companiyon dwaara desh main shikaayat adhikari kii niyukti zaruri he
 The Delhi High Court in August 2013 ordered the government to enforce this rule
 iske baad fasebuk,google or twitor jaisi companiyon ne bharat ke liye shikaayat adhikari ko europe or america main baitha diya
 Police and security forces are helpless to prevent rumors like cow protection, witch and child theft from being broadcast on platforms like Facebook and whatsapp
 whotsap main shikaayat adhikari ke madhyam se afvaahon ke sangathit bazaar par lagaam lagane ke saath police dwaara puraane kanoonon par sakht amal se mob linching par yadi prabhavi ankush nahin lagaaya gaya,to desh ko bheedtantr banane se kaise roka ja sakegaa

 CM TS Rawat will start the campaign on September 3: 17 thousand malnourished children are in Uttarakhand, 1600 untrained Uttarakhand government has devised new tricks to fight malnutrition
 kuposhan ke khilaaf jang main ab mukhyamantri se lekar prashasnic amale ke adhikari tak, sabhi kii sakriy bhoomika hogi
 Its outline has been prepared
 mukhyamantri trivendra singh ravat 3 sitambar ko kuposhan ke khilaaf abhiyaan kii aupchaarik shuruyaat karenge
 According to the information, the responsibility of this campaign has been entrusted to the Education, Health and Child Development Department
 mukhyamantri ravat samet pradesh sarkaar ke sabhi mantri or adhikari ek-ek kuposhit bacchon kii dekhbhaal kii jimmedaari uthaaenge
 The Department of Women Empowerment and Child Development has engaged 94 officers of the Secretariat in this task
 mukhyamantri ravat ne kaha ki kuposhan kaa shikaar hue shesh bacchon ke liye lagaataar pushtaahar bheja ja rahaa he
 He said that in the absence of correct information, children are not given nutrition
 mukhyamantri ne kaha ki logon ko ise lekar jaagruk karne ke liye vyapak prachaar prasar kii jarurat he
 For this, a comprehensive campaign is being started from September 3
 unhone kaha ki garbhvatee mahilaon kii jaanch kar unhen bhi paushtik aahaar diya ja rahaa he
 The Chief Minister said that now a detailed plan will be made for anemic pregnant women
 mahila shashaktikaran evam bal vikaas vibhaag kii sachiv saujanya ne kaha ki pradesh main 1600 atikuposhit bachche hai
 The total figure of malnourished children is 17000
 unhone kaha ki atikuposhit bachche is daayre se baahar nikal saken
 For this, these children are planned to be adopted by ministers, legislators and officials
 saujanya ke anusaar yah abhiyaan puure pradesh main ek maheene tak chalegaa
 Every year hundreds of children are falling victim to child trafficking in Jharkhand
 lekin unhen khojane vaala koi nahin he
 Renu, the 10-year-old daughter of Jatru Orao of Chanho block of Ranchi, went missing two years ago
 uski gumshudagi ke peeche kisi hiraman minj kaa naam bataaya jaataa he
 Ratni Kumari, the 12-year-old daughter of Soma Orao of Chanho, was missing in 2010 and 14-year-old daughter Shanti of Dhure Orao of the same area is missing since 2010
 ye maamle na police kii file main hai or na hi inke garib maa-baap ko yah pataa he ki unke bachche jinda bhi hai yaa nahin
 Police moves are sluggish due to which the matter goes into cold storage after a few days
 log apane bacchon ko paane kii aas main police se lekar maanavadhikaar or court tak ja chuke hai
 Baliram Paswan of Gumla had reached the Jharkhand High Court in March 2008 to recover his son Akash Raj and his two friends Shashank Shekhar and Pawan Soni
 paswan kii tarah sushamaa kispotta ne bhi apane do bhatijon ranjit (7) or anup (4) kii baramadagi ke liye hycourt kaa darwaja khatkhataya
 They were lost in October 2010
 gumshudagi, khaas kar bacchon ke maamle kii jaanch karne ke liye aparaadh anusandhan vibhaag (siidi) adhikrut he
 So the police did nothing other than research the paper
 so court ne pichley saal aktubar main donon maamalon ko janhit yachika main parivartit karte hue baliram ke maamle ko sibiai ke hawaale karne kaa aadesh diya
 And sought a detailed report from the CID on the missing children in Jharkhand and the action taken by the police so far
 sibiai baliram ke maamle kii jaanch kar rahi he
 He says, "I am not fighting for my son, but for the children whose childhood devils go to their advantage
" main to bas ummid par jinda hum
 But when the court also ordered a CBI inquiry in Sushma's case last month, stating that the agency looked into other unsolved cases of disappearance, the CBI moved the Supreme Court against this order, saying that for her It will not be possible to investigate hundreds of those cases
 sibiai ke vakil mukhtaar khan kehete hai, ''sibiai kaa gathan vishesh jaanch ke liye hua he
 This is the work of the State Police and not ours
 ham ek do maamle le sakate hai lekin sab kii jaanch karnaa sambhav nahin he
 "the figures of disappearance presented with great precision have also failed to hide the truth
" siidi ne court main daayar halafname main kaha ki 2008 se 2011 ke aktubar maah tak jharkhand ke vibhinn jilon main gumshudagi ke 335 maamle saamne aae
 There is no trace of cases prior to 2008
 in bacchon kii baramadagi kii dar 10 fisadi se adhik nahin he
 This shows the irresponsible attitude of the police
 adivaasiyon kii garibi or berogari kaa phayda uthaate hue akasar yahaan dalal unhen chand paise kaa laalach dekar unke bacchon ko shaharon main le jate hai jahaan unhen gharelu naukar ke rup main rakhaa jaataa he
 They later realize that their children have fallen victim to organized gangs
 jharkhand ke gumla, simdega, khunti, lohardaga jile or santhal pargana ke ilaakon main to saikadon placement cell khul chuke hai
 In 2010, 14-year-old Pradeep Orao of Sisai in Gumla district was taken to Delhi by an agent working for sunny placements
 bandhua majdoor ke taur par kaam kar rahe pradeep ko chhudaane ke liye pita ramesh orav ko 15,000 ru
 Had to give
 siidi ke mahanireekshak anuraag gupta kehete hai
 "the so-called relatives who take these children to the city are the ones who are associated with some agency
" ham akasar soochna paakar talaashi abhiyaan chalaate hai
 We also get success
 lekin kai baar aisa bhi hua he jab bas stand or railway stesan par in dallalon ko pakadaa gaya to unke saath ke bacchon ne khud ko unka rishtedaar bataa diya
 If we do not have a better rehabilitation system then what happens to their recovery
 '' yah bhi sach he, lekin prashasnic or police kii chusti bhi samay kii maang he
 In Pulwama in Jammu and Kashmir, 37 soldiers were killed in a terrorist attack on Thursday

 Lado Sarai is a village in Delhi
 yah gaanv ab shahar ban chukaa he
 The raw lanes have been shielded with cement and the drainage water is jammed at the bottom, then it starts leaking into the houses
 lado sarai pahunchate hi hamaari vyavastha kii traasadee najar aane lagati he
 a seven-year-old child Avinash died of dengue here a few days ago
 khabaron ke mutabik avinaash ke pita lakshmichandra or maa babita use lekar kai aspataalon main gaye lekin kai jagahon se manaa kar diya gaya
 Avinash could not be saved due to the delay
 is sadame main babitha or lakshmichandra ne building se kud kar apni jaan de di
 i could not keep myself normal while reading this news
 aap jitna sochie ki yah apwaad rahaa hoga, lekin utana hi maa baap kii bebasii ankhon ke saamne naach rahi thi
 When i reached Lado Sarai, after three-three deaths the tragedy of society and the system was visible in the streets, which filled with anger
 lage ki lado sarai kii kabhi upeksha nahin hui he
 
 
 a lime line was made outside the garbage house at the entrance
 jisase media ko lage ki yahaan saaf-safai hoti he
 i wish the same would happen with the whole of Delhi or any city
 teen-teen maut ke baad system kii yah nautanki or pareshaan karne vaali thi
 Posters containing dengue prevention measures were placed on the inner walls of the village
 logon ne bataaya ki yahaan se laash jate hi em si di vaale aa gaye or poster laga gaye
 Did not apply before
 meri nigaah ek aise hi poster par padi
 The date was written from January to September
 kisi ko bhi dikh saktaa he ki sari tareekhen ek hi pencil, ek hi likhaawat or ek hi roj likhi gayi hai
 Why the January handwriting will look like the handwriting of September
 kuch to rang main fark aana chahie tha
 It is good for the system to come into action, but writing the dates of the cleanliness drive in this way is nothing short of shameless
 logon ne bataaya ki pehle phoging hui nahin, ab jaakar phoging bhi hui he
 On coming out of the village, people showed that toilets have started being built on the roadside
 majdoor teji se kaam kar rahe the
 The villagers said that due to the fear of the media, toilets are being built
 logon ko dikhaane ke liye
 Prior to this, there is no public toilet anywhere around the village
 hamen khule main shouch karnaa padataa he
 There is a nice little park near Lado Sarai
 bacchon ke liye bane is park ko maujuuda system ke lihaaz se kaaphi acha hi kaha jayega
 Bio toilets were built in this park
 use dekhne chalaa gaya
 The condition of the toilet had become worse, no maintenance
 vahaan machharon ne raaj kaayam kar liya tha
 The comments iske baad gaanv waalon ne dikhaaya ki rashtramandal khelon ke dauraan sadak ke kinare kamare banaae gaye the
 It was in his knowledge that counters for opening bills etc
 would open in it, but he is still closed
 chaaro taraf kachra jamaa ho gaya he
 Another such room remains nearby
 uskaa darwaja peeche se khulaa hua tha
 Good light was on
 jarur iske liye sarkaar kaa lakhon rupaya barbaad hua hoga or vah bina kisi kaam kaa footpath par padaa hua he
 This is a picture of our country
 aisa kya he ki tamaam raajnneetik badlaavon ke saath neeche kaa system nahin badalata he
 Which is where it does not do its minimum work
 agar system kaam karne vaala hota to sadak kinare bane yah donon kamare bekaar nahin hote
 In winter, rains could do shelter work for the poor
 yah sari tasviren hataasha paidaa karne vaali hai
 We will get tired of it doing MCD vs Delhi Government, Delhi Government vs Central Government
 sara kuch sulajh jayega tab bhi yah hakeekat nahin badalane vaali he
 Isn't it shameful that the MCD is doing a smudge to save its image at the place where three people died

 What is it is that the system below does not change with all the political changes
 jo jahaan he vah apana nunatam kaam nahin karata he
 If the system were to work, both of these rooms built on the road would not be useless
 sardi ke dinon main hi garibon ke liye rain basere ke kaam kar sakate the
 All these pictures are frustrating

 Condemning the 'hideous terrorist attack' at a mosque in southeast Iran, US President Barack Obama called it an unforgivable crime
 obama ne ek bayaan main kaha, ‘‘poojasthal par nirdosh nagarikon kii hatya akshamya aparaadh he or jo iske liye apradhi hai unhen jimmedaar tehraaya janaa chahie
 "the US stands with the people of Iran who have lost their lives and are injured in such attacks," he said
 ’’obama ne kaha, ‘‘duniyabar ke logon ko saath aakar aatankwaad kii ninda or iskaa virodh karnaa chahie
 At the same time, human rights should be supported against a violent environment
 ’’ america ke raashtrapati se pehle videsh mantri hillari clinton ne bhi in hamalon kii ninda kii
 Hillary said, "the families of those killed in the attack have full consolation from the US
 ’’ videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa pi je krole ne kaha, ‘‘ham har tarah ke aatankwaad kii ninda karte hai
 If anywhere in the world, any citizen is a victim of terrorism then we are sad and we consider these terrorist incidents to be cowardice and disgusting

 - shahid kapoor (@shahidkapoor) August 10, 2014 aaj ek dost ne charchaa ched di isliye hindi cinema ke gayakadvay yaad aa gaye
 Both of them emerged in the eighties
 bhaavana badi acchhee thi lekin du: anayas hi judata chalaa gaya
 One was Mohammad Aziz, the other Shabbir Kumar
 donon sur ke sadhak the
 Sen in one tan, Pralapi in another
 mahaan rafee ke jivan ke antim varshon ke gaanon ko sunate hue in awaajon kaa purvabhaas hone lagata he
 Then suddenly one day when she ripped the closed walls of the radio and sat intruding in our ears, we realized that copy art can vary a lot
 chunki har gayak apane jivan main kabhi na kabhi kharaab gaata he, lihaaja rafee ne bhi kuch gane kharaab gaae the, unke andhbhakt isse asahmat ho sakate hai, lekin kisi din saamne baith kar unhen samajha duungaa ki rafee, kishor, mahaan lata, or mukesh, manna de sabane kuch gane kharaab gaae hai
 However, these two Sahabs took the best inspiration for their singing from Rafi's worst songs and came to sleep in the harmonium
 unhen sunate hue aisa lagata he jaise, (kaash wo vishisht aawaaj in shabdon se nikaal paata) mohammad rafee kii ruh ko danda maar kar gale main bitha diya gaya ho
 Once when Aziz Saheb was being interviewed on a poor channel, while talking to the reader, he proudly said that Rafi Sahab had been fit since childhood
 tabhi main samaj gaya tha, ab na chhutihain
 
 
 a subtle deviation in the song makes a big difference
 yahaan to donon ne durbhaagya se rafee sahab ke jivan ke antim varshon main gaae geeton se jo dhwani sunai padati he use hi saadh liya tha
 When the song started from there, the soul of listeners shook
 mand-mand gambhir hone kaa bhram paidaa karti vah aawaaj, rafee kii ruh ko sanbhale ek jinnaati jajba paidaa karti he
 It used to be that someone is practicing the system of singing in Masaan, and do not ask the Lyrics of that era
 yah ek aisa dadli cocktail tha, jo sambhavat: aage kabhi na hoga
 If done, the good fortune of Hindi cinema
 unke gaae kuch kaaljayi gaanon main, aajkali yaad kuchhi rahita nahin
 
 chunki gaate hue, aajkal, kuch or rahata kii dhwani uparokt ho jaati thi, isiilie vaisaa likhaa gaya he
 Like, once you remember
 
 The second sample, i am surprised to see your julifs, aa ha ha Dabur amla hair oil
 
 Neither Funkar Tujhisa Yaya after you
 
 Muhammed Rafi, you missed me a lot
 
 One is to sing on Rafi, the other is to film Amitabh
 ek taraf rafee jaisi reshmi aawaaj, duusari ore amitabh jaisi abhootpurv dialog delivery
 Mohammed Aziz committed historical injustice to both these personalities, but the culprits were not the producers of the film whose lousy minds had conceived, and filmed, such a song
 jaise ki, 'aakhri rasta' film kaa ek gaanaa he, 'tuune meraa doodh piya he, tu bilkul mere jaisaa he, uf ! maa kii chaati main doodh utar aae
 And the heroic among the singers, when Shabbir Kumar sang for Amitabh, made him the best man of Hindi cinema
 marid taange vaala
 
 yaad he naa?usee film kaa ek or gaanaa he, o maa sherawali
 Karunik narrative of mother-son union straying from ages to ages in Hindi cinema
 uff mat puuchhie, ab bhi jab vah gaanaa bajataa he, mere hriday ke saare kapaat vednaa ke jhanjhaavat main tharthara uthte hai
 Were the singers both, Zee does writing on his own songs
 kareeb dedh dashak tak in donon hi rambhaate gayakon ne kuch behtareen nagine die hai
 Hukumat, when a song from Dharmendra's great film plays in the voice of Shabbir Kumar, the desire for the fight arises, because his words are 'hey Maro Hit Him
 
 'such workmanship in the voice! Long research is needed on both these singers, who inspired Rafi to trample Rafi? All the songs of this era, which were sung by Rishi Kapoor, Mithun, Amitabh, and Jitendra, who wore white ghostly clothes from top to bottom, were priceless, listeners consider that surmala lost time as their good fortune
 unke kuch yaadgaar gaanon kii ek choti si suchi aapke saamne he
 You have done so much restlessness, My name is Lakhan, paper pen dalat la, how much sorrow is there in the world, i will be mad in your love
 See that both these majestic singers get mostly lamentable songs
 or donon ne kukkur rudan sareekha swar paidaa kiya
 His list of such songs is very long
 jis par garv kiya ja saktaa he
 Listening to many of his songs, it seems as if some dacoit of Rafi has gone crazy, has sat down with a katta in his neck and is saying, Sing son
 aise gayak baar baar paidaa nahin hote
 a golden period of cinema produces them
 jate jate, shabbir kumaar kaa ek gaanaa suniega, 'gori hai kalaaiyaan
 
 ' amitabh bachchan ke staradam ke sabase vikaraal samay main gayaki kaa ye bhima paidaa hua tha, jisane gale kii gada se sabko parrast kar diya tha
 i salute both these Asurasanis
 antarrashtriya cricket parishad (isisi) ne guuruuvaar ko pushti kii ki bharat or westeindies ke bich duusare test ke pehle din ke khel ke dauraan tisare ampire ko galat riple dikhaane ke kaaran bhartiya captain mahendra singh dhoni ko out qaraar kiya gaya
 During the Indian innings, Indian captain Dhoni was caught out at mid-on off Fidel Edwards
 maidani ampire ian gould ko andeh tha ki yah gend no ball ho sakati he isaliye niyamon ke anusaar unhone tisare ampire gregory brathwite se isaki pushti maangi
 But the replay shown by host broadcaster to Brathwaite was valid, so Dhoni was dismissed
 haalanki baad main pataa chalaa ki brathwite ko galat riple dikhaaya gaya tha or jis gend par dhoni ko out kiya gaya tha
 She was no hair
 isisi match referi kris broad ne kaha, is shrinkhalaa ke mejabaan prasarak iemji media ne apni galati sweekaar kar lee he or iske liye maafee maangi he
 This was unfortunate, but given the circumstances, i am satisfied that this mistake was not made intentionally
 isse maahaul tanaavpurn ho gaya he
 Brad said, umpires adopted the correct procedure so they cannot be held responsible
 ve is maamle main doshi nahin hai
 He said, given that the game continued after that, it clearly shows that this decision cannot be changed
 ham ab is ghatana ko peeche chhodane or bache hue match kii ore badhane ko baadhya hai
 Meanwhile, IMG Media spokesperson took responsibility for this and said that it was a case of human error
 unhone kaha, iemji media bahut gambhirtha se is maamle kii jimmedaari letaa he
 This was a human lapse
 lagata he madhyapradesh ke karmchaariyon ko nai sarkaar kaa bhi khauf nahin he
 This was noticed in the trauma center of Neemuch district hospital
 tractor trali palatney se 3 mahilaon kii maut or haadase main kareeb ek darjan se adhik ghayalon ko ilaaj ke liye jila chikitsaalay refer kiya gaya
 All the staff had already been informed about this
 staff ko sachet kiya gaya tha ki marijon ko turant chikitsa uplabdh karaaen magar karmchaariyon kii laaparvaahee kaa alam yah tha ki ek taraf haadase main ghayal log aspataal main aa rahe the to vahiin duusari ore logon kii jaan kii jimmedaari apane kandhon par uthaane vaali norsen aspataal ke general ward ke store room main nayaa saal manaa kar rahi thim
 While the injured patients were groaning in pain in the accident, on the other hand the nurses were making noise in celebration of New Year
 yah sab tab ho rahaa tha jab aspataal main jila panchayat siio sahit aalaa adhikari marijon kii dekhbhaal ke liye vyavasthaaon ko dekhne ke liye aspataal main maujuud the
 The media personnel knocked on the door of the room as soon as the media was eyeing the entire incident
 darwaja khulte hi norsen bhadak gayi
 After this, the nurses locked the door and started walking from there
 media ke kehane par ediem kamalesh bhargav ne karmchaariyon se chaabi maangi to chaabi dene main anakani karte dekh baad main adhikariyon kii maujuudagi main daravaaje kaa taala todaa gaya
 As soon as the lock was broken, it did not take any time for anyone to understand
 vahaan nae saal kaa jashn manaaya ja rahaa tha
 The most embarrassing thing is that the staff was celebrating at a time when three women had broken the cords of their lives
 kareeb darjanabhar marij jindagi or maut ke bich jhul rahe the
 Not only this, the area around the hospital is said to always be at peace and slogans are written
 magar yah sab kuch aspataal main hi ho rahaa tha
 The authorities have ordered an inquiry into the entire matter and assured them to take strict action on the responsibilities
 adhikariyon kii maujuudagi main maamle kaa panchnaama banaaya gaya
 After investigation late in the evening, the Collector suspended two staff nurses for negligence in view of the seriousness of the case
 lakhanu main hue lallantop sho ke aakhri seshan main khyath abhinayta or singer piyush mishra, laila main laila fame singer paavani pandey or film newton kaa sangeet dene vaaleen rachita aroda ne shirkat kii
 During this time, the three artists shared interesting experiences of their lives
 piyush mishra ne bataaya ki kis tarah unhone dasvin class main apana naam badal liya tha
 His name was Priyakant Sharma earlier
 isliye unhen log priya-priya kahkar chidhaate the
 He did not like it and changed his name to Piyush Mishra
 unhone bataaya ki unase life main har kaam ho gaya, phir chaahe wo harmonium bajaanaa ho, gayaki ho yaa geet likhnaa ho yaa adaakaari ho
 He said all these things are done to him, but two cups of tea are not made
 romance hameshaa gulabi nahin hota, irshaad bole- 'jitna sachcha, utana hi kaamyaab hoga'piyush ne kaha, 'main khud ko yang maanata hum or main yang hi maruunga

 'piyush told that one year he also learned classical singing

 This drama was' Hamlet never went to Bombay
 ab piyush ise upanyaas kii shakl main laa rahe hai
 Piyush Mishra also spoke about the conflict in his relationship with Anurag Kashyap, which caused a lot of disruption with Anurag
 unhone kaha, anuraag se kabhi dosti nahin tut sakati
 They are very close to him
 anuraag se unka man-mutaav jarur hua
 What kind of friendship without any fuss? Now Anurag has not met for a long time
 anuraag se kabhi dosti khatm nahin ho sakati
 'aamir's' daughter' Zaira said - wept for 4 days, crying for 4 days, when Anurag's eyes came in tears and Rachita Arora, who gave her music in boxer, told how she met Anurag Kashyap for the first time
 unhen pataa chalaa ki anuraag ko mujeec compoger khoj rahe hai
 He asked for time with Anurag and went to meet his office
 chunki rachita deree se offis pahunchi thim, isliye unka anuraag se milanaa tab hua jab ve offis se nikal rahe the
 Anurag heard Rachita's music in the car itself
 ye itnaa imotional tha ki ise sunakar anuraag ke aansu aa gaae
 In this way Ruchita got a chance as a composer in boxer

 Team India chemist Blaster Sachin Tendulkar has once made it clear about his retirement that he is not thinking of anything at the moment, because his mind and his body still ask him to play cricket

 The opposition has been attacking the BJP over evms since the exit poll after the Lok Sabha elections
 vipaksh kii maang he ki VVPAT kii kam se 50 pratishat parchiyon kaa milan kiya jaae
 After the Election Commission turned down this demand, on one hand, there has been a surge in BJP
 duusari taraf vipaksh ne is par hamale or tej kar die hai
 BJP national president Amit Shah has accused the opposition of tarnishing the image of democracy
 amit shah ne twit kar kaha, "EVM kaa virodh desh kii janata ke janadesh kaa anadar he
 Fueled by the defeat, these 22 parties are tarnishing the image of the country and its democracy in the world by questioning the democratic process of the country
 "amit shah ne kaha, "main in sabhi partiyon se kuch prashn poochna chahta hum
 "subsequently, Shah continuously tweeted several questions asking the opposition 6 questions
 prashn-1 : EVM kii vishwasaneeyata par prashn uthaane vaali in adhikansh vipakshi partiyon ne kabhi na kabhi EVM dwaara hue chunaavon main vijay praapt kii he
 If they do not believe in EVM, then why did these parties hold the power thread if they won the election? - Chowkidar Amit Shah (@amitshah) May 22, 2019 Q-2: After the Supreme Court of the country took cognizance of more than three pils The electoral process has been finalized
 jisamen kii har vidhansabha kshetra main paanch VVPAT ko ginaney kaa aadesh diya he
 So are you also questioning the order of the Supreme Court? - Chowkidar Amit Shah (@amitshah) May 22, 2019 Question-3: Just two days before the counting of votes, 22 opposition parties demanding change in electoral process is completely unconstitutional because No such decision is possible without the consensus of all parties
 — Chowkidar Amit Shah (@amitshah)may 22, 2019prashn-4: vipaksh ne EVM ke vishay par hangaamaa chah charnon kaa matdaan samaapt hone ke baad shuru kiya
 This became more acute after the exit poll
 eczit pole EVM ke aadhaar par nahin balki matadaata se prashn puch kar kiya jaataa he
 So how can you question the credibility of evms based on exit poll? - Chowkidar Amit Shah (@amitshah) May 22, 2019 Q-5: Election Commission publicly challenged by taking proactive steps on the subject of EVM disturbances It was invited to perform
 parantu us chunauti ko kisi bhi vipakshi dal ne sweekaar nahin kiya
 - Chowkidar Amit Shah (@amitshah) May 22, 2019 Amidst the questions, he said, "after this, the Election Commission further made the election process more transparent by linking EVM to VVPAT
 VVPAT prakriya ke aane ke baad matadaata mat dene ke baad dekh saktaa he ki uskaa mat kis party ko register hua he
 How reasonable is it to raise a question after the process is so transparent? "question-6: Some opposition parties are making objectionable statements like 'taking up arms' and" shedding of blood "if the election results are not favorable
 vipaksh bataaye ki aise hinsaatmak or aloktantric bayaan ke dwaara vah kise chunauti de rahaa he?— Chowkidar Amit Shah (@amitshah)may 22, 2019unhone aage kaha, "EVM par vipaksh dwaara uthaae ja rahe prashn sirf bhranti failaane kaa prayaas hai, jisase prabhavit hue bina ham sabko hamaare prajatantric sansthaanon ko or majboot karne kaa prayaas karnaa chahie
 "explain that the opposition demands that if the VVPAT slips at any booth do not match correctly, then the VVPAT slips of all the polling stations in that assembly constituency should be counted and matched with the results of the evms
 chunaav ayog ne buudhvaar ko lambii baithak kar vivipat parchiyon kii ginati kii prakriya se karne se inkaar kar diya he
 The commission said, the slips would be matched in the same manner as already decided
 isse pehle supreme court bhi parchiyon ke milan kaa pratishat badhaane vaali maang kii yachika khaarij kar chukaa he

 The Central Government has raised the question of dalit-adivasi and OBC reservation amid questions raised on the minority status of Aligarh Muslim University and Jamia Millia Islamia University

 Gehlot said that the reservation given to Dalit, Adivasi and other backward class students in the name of minority status in these institutions was denied and will not happen now
 gahalot ne irani ko 18 janvari ko likhe apane patr main kaha he ki maanav sansaadhaan vikaas mantralay kaa ye kadam saraahneey he, kyonki isse samaveshi samaaj ke nirmaan main sahyog milegaa or pradhanmantri narendra modi kii manshaanusaar 'sabakaa saath sabakaa vikaas' sahi arthon main lagu kiya ja sakegaa
 Gehlot told NDTV that his ministry has been continuously receiving reports about these two universities, in which under the garb of minority status, dalit-adivasi and OBC students were said to be denying constitution-provided reservation and other facilities
 gahalot ke mutabik ab jabaki maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantralay ne spasht kiya he ki jamiya milia vishvavidhyalay or aligarh muslim vishvavidhyalay kaa alpsankhyak darja na hokar ye kendriya vishvavidhyalay hai, in chaatro ko unka adhikaar dilaane main aasaani hogi

 In his letter to Irani on 18 January, Gehlot said that this step of the Ministry of Human Resource Development is commendable, because it will help in building an inclusive society and implemented 'sabka Saath Sabka Vikas' in true sense as per Prime Minister Narendra Modi's vision
