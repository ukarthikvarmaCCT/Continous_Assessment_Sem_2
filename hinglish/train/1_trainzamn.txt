haalanki, sutron ke mutabik, baithkon main daleel di gai ki abhi netritv parivartan kiya gaya to andolan ke aage jhukkar aarakshan dene ke faisle ke baad ise bhi jaaton kii jeet ke taur par dekha jayega
 But the manner in which the contradiction has deepened in the party, the demand to remove Khattar in the coming time may pick up
 haalanki modi kii kaaryastylee ko kareeb se dekhne vaale ek varisht netaa bataate hai, ''modi kabhi bhi netritv main badlaav yaa team ko zyada phent main bharosa nahin rakhte
 Hence, there is talk of removing Chief Minister Anandiben Patel from the worsened situation after the Patidar agitation in Gujarat or the speculation about Khattar does not seem to have much merit
 '' ve yah bhi daleel dete hai ki khatter ho yaa anandiben, donon modi kii pasand se mukhyamantri bane hai, donon ko banaate vakt saamaajik-rajnatik samikarnon ko tarjeeh nahin di gai
 In such a situation, if they are removed, then questions will be directly raised on Prime Minister Modi
 lekin in daleelon se itar bijepi ke ek anya netaa kehete hai, ''kya gujarat main modi ne kabhi aisi paristhitiyon kaa saamana kiya tha? ab unhen dilli kii raajnneeti jarur samaj aa rahi hogi, isliye anubhav ke saath bahut se siddhant bhi badalte rahete hai
 In such a situation, there will be no surprise if the leadership changes after a few months of calm
 ''cameti par bhi uthne lage sawalin daleelon main dam isliye bhi najar aata he kyonki is hinsak andolan ke mudde par bijepi main do-faad saaf najar aa rahaa he
 When the bjp's five-member committee, headed by Parliamentary Affairs Minister Venkaiah Naidu, gave a third meeting on 24 February, all mps from Haryana were called to give reservation to the Jats at the central level as well
 sutron ke mutabik, is baithak main haryana bijepi ke adhyaksh subhash baraala ne ek cliping dikhaai jisamen jat aarakshan kaa virodh karte hue saansad rajkumaar saini bol rahe the
 After this clipping, non-jat mps rallied and in the meeting itself, there was tremendous tu-tu, main-i between the two factions
 congress se bijepi main aae or abhi modi sarkaar main mantri raav indrajit singh ne to cameti par hi sawaal uthaa die
 According to sources, he said that there is not a single OBC representative in this committee, so how can Jats be considered to give reservation from OBC quota
 baithak main 34 hajaar karod rupye ke nuksaan, aagjanee, balaatkaar, chaatraon ke hostel main ghusane jaise mudde bhi uthe
 According to sources, one MP even said that non-jats have formed the BJP government in Haryana, but if Jats are given preference, then non-jats will have to leave politics
 saansad saini ne to apane talkh tevar main kah diya ki unhone apni obisi birdari kii baat kii he or ve aage bhi kehete rahenge
 non-jats demand that Jats be given reservation without tampering with 27 per cent of obcs
 gaiyr-jat netaaon kaa gut is baat par ada he ki police kii goli se maare gaye logon ko muaavja nahin dena chahie
 On the other hand, political mercury is also in spate in Chandigarh
 hinsa main hui kshati kii bharpai or mritkon ko muaavja dene ke liye hui cabinet baithak main khatter sarkaar ke mantri anil vij ne to sidhaa morcha khol diya tha
 According to sources, non-jat mlas are happy with Vij's disenchantment and a camp is demanding a meeting of the legislature party soon
 is baithak ke jariye naaraaz vidhayak netritv parivartan kii aawaaj buland karnaa chaahate hai
 This situation can be extremely difficult for the BJP as 41 of the bjp's 47 mlas are non-jats and only 6 are from the Jat community, with two ministers
 jatigat bantwaare kii hakeekat ko un dangaiyon ke prati haryana police kii sust pratikriya main bhi dekha ja saktaa tha, jo raste main padane vaali har cheez ko lut rahe the or aag laga de rahe the
 There are many reports that the Jat agitators knew in advance that the police would not take any action against them, so they blocked the road with great leisure and even dug deep pits from the excavators on the highway's contact routes
 rohtak, jhajjar or bhivani main dekhte hi goli maarane ke aadesh lekar utari fouj ko apane haathon main vastav main placard lekar dangaiyon ko dikhaanaa padaa kyonki naram pulisavaalon kii unhen pehle se aadat padi hui thi
 Again, the issue of Jat reservation and JNU was important in the big challenges that the Modi government has faced so far outside the Rajnath Parliament
 jab andolan hinsak ho uthaa to pradhanmantri narendra modi ne grih mantri rajnath singh ko phone kar sthiti sanbhaalane ko kaha
 In the Lalitgate case, Vasundhara Raje, Sushma Swaraj's defense and Shivraj Singh Chauhan in Vyapam and Rajnath, who took command on the award return issue, had to come forward from the government once again as a troubleshooter
 party ke ek varisht netaa kaa maananaa he ki bijepi ke sheersh netritv main jis tarah kaa abhijatyavargeey varchasv he, usamen gramin prishthbhumi ke dhoti pahanane vaale ekmaatr netaa rajnath singh hi hai jo kisaanon ke muddon ke saath-saath kai ahm masalon par party kaa paksh prakharata se rakhte rahe hai
 Rajnath's image being pro-farmer as the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, he is also considered an influence in this class
 20 farvari kii subah modi ne rajnath se puure maamle ko sanbhaalane ko kaha
 After that Jat leader and Union Minister of State Sanjeev Balyan was made the arbitrator
 unhone sabase pehle upi ke khap choudhariyon or aarakshan sangharsh samiti ke saath baithak kii
 The next day these Jat leaders were sent to Haryana for honorarium
 phir haryana ke jat netaa dilli aakar rajnath se mili
 Rajnath assured, "BJP is in favor of reservation, but what is the constitutional-legal path, it is being considered
" '' duusari taraf khatter ne sarvadaleey baithak bulaakar bill laane kaa elaan kiya or shah ne cameti bana di
 Whatever the outcome of the modi-shah lesson movement, the series of caste reservation movements is giving a lesson to the Modi government that the absence of strong leadership in the states and the balance of social equations from the state to the center and bypassing the political stature The solution of the equation of power will not be easy
 bijepi ke ek netaa bataate hai, ''modi-shah ko yah akalan karnaa hoga ki nijee swaarth main lipt mandali ke kuch logon ne sarkaar or party main bhale apni sthiti majboot kar lee, lekin sarkaar or party kii sthiti kahaan pahunchaa di he
 On the issue of Jat reservation, the way the failure of the BJP government of Haryana has come out, it should be expected that Modi will now understand the politics of Delhi
 khud sangh pramukh mohan bhagwat bihar chunaav ke dauraan aarakshan par nai bahes ched chuke hai or ab jab bijepi adhyaksh ne jat aarakshan masale par rajnatik cameti gathit kii to bhagwat ne phir apana purana rukh doharaa diya
 He advised to set up a non-political committee to review the reservation
 bijepi ke ek netaa kaa kahana he, ''bihar chunaav ke samay sangh pramukh ke aarakshan sambandhi bayaan se rajnatik napha-nuksaan chaahe jo hua ho lekin jaaton ke hinsak andolan ke baad badale hue paridrishy main bhagwat kaa vah bayaan ki aarakshan ke liye dabaav samooh banate hai or raajnneeti hoti he, bilkul sahi prathit ho rahaa he
 Angry Jats have cooled down for some time after the intervention of the Center and the announcement of enactment of a law on reservation for Jats
 bijepi or uske mukhyamantri ne haalanki aisa karke bhaanumati ke pitare par lage dhakkan ko hataa diya he
 It will be impossible to tell what will be the result
 lekin is andolan ne aarakshan ke mul bhav ko hi badal diya he
 The basic sense of reservation bhimrao ambedkar ne diya tha usamen samaaj ke us varg kaa pratinidhitiv tha jo vaaki deen-hin he
 That class is said to be in need of additional protection
 lekin aazaadee ke baad ke pehle 40 varshon main aghoshit jatvaad or phir mandal ke baad ghoshit jatvaad ke daur main jatiyon ke naam kii partiyaan or netaa ban gaye hai
 Today, the basis of reservation is not social weakness, but how capable a demanding society is in displaying political vision and muscle power
 aarakshan kaa uddeshy samaaj main dare-sahame logon ko sabal bananaa tha, lekin aaj ke daur main daraa-sahamaakar rajnatik varg aarakshan lenaa chaahate hai
 In such a situation, the modi-shah duo will have to understand where the BJP which has got an overwhelming majority in the Lok Sabha elections, is finding itself standing today
 agar ab bijepi kii nai jodi apni style main sudhaar kar sake to nishchit taur par vah itihaas rach sakati he, lekin is sthiti ko dirghakaalik ranneeti ke tahat nahin sudhara gaya to aarakshan kii pechidagiyon main ulajh itihaas bhi ban sakate hai

 Bollywood's famous actress Sridevi passed away late on Saturday night
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki cardiyak arest ke chalate unki maut hui he
 Everyone is expressing regret after hearing this news
 bollywood ke tamaam stars der raat se hi twit kar shridevi kii maut par dukh jaahir kar rahe hai
 But a tweet by century superstar Amitabh Bachchan remains a topic of discussion on social media
 darasal, shanivaar raat big bi ne teen twit kiye
 The first tweet of these was at 1 pm, in which the Indian team was congratulated for winning the T20 match against South Africa
 iske baad 1 bajkar 13 minute par unhone ek pustak vimochan samaaroh kii tasviir share kin
 Big b made his last tweet of the night, two minutes after that, ie at 1
15
 is twit main unhone likhaa, 'na jane kyun, ek ajeeb si ghabrahat ho rahi he!! amitabh bachchan ke is twit ke kuch der baad hi abhinetri shridevi kii maut kii khabar aane lageen
 Soon after, Boney Kapoor's brother Sanjay Kapoor confirmed the news of his death
 t 2625 - na jane kyun , ek ajeeb si ghabrahat ho rahi he !!— Amitabh Bachchan (@srbachchan)february 24, 2018@sohail2502 twitor handle se amitabh bachchan ke is twit par ek riplai kiya gaya
 In which he wrote that as soon as Amitabh Sir shared this thing, only after 20 minutes Sridevi died
 bijepi ke saath jaakar ajit pavaar ko hua nuksaanchaacha sharad pavaar se baghawat kar gaye the bhaajapa ke sathmaharashtra main shanivaar ko behad hi naatakeey dhang se devendra fadanvis ne mukhyamantri pad kii shapath lee
 The most surprising thing was that Ajit Pawar was sworn in as the Deputy Chief Minister
 devendra fadanvis or ajit pavaar kii shapath ke baad desh ke bade raajnneetik pandit hairaan rah gaye
 At the same time, the leaders of Shiv Sena, Congress and NCP took some time to understand the entire scene, but when they came out, they were in a very attacking mode
 shapath ke agle hi din yani ravivaar ko hi teenon partiyon ne yachika daayar kii or sabhi pakshon ko sunne ke baad adaalat ne buudhvaar ko fadanvis ko bahumat sabit karne ko kaha
 BJP leaders may claim to have the support of 145 mlas but between these claims on Tuesday afternoon 2
 35 baje ajit pavaar ne dipti siem pad se istipha de diya
 With the resignation of Ajit Pawar, it was also clear that the Fadnavis government would not last long and Devendra Fadnavis resigned from the post of CM shortly after
 is puure ghatnakram ko dekhen to isamen zyada nuksaan ajit pavaar ko hua
 Actually, Ajit Pawar no longer holds the post of Deputy CM nor is he expected to get this position in the government formed by Shiv Sena, Congress and NCP alliance
 chachaa sharad pavaar ke khilaaf kii bagaavanjit pavaarane apane chachaa sharad pavaar kii ichha ke viruddh jaakar devendra fadanvis se haath mila liya tha
 Ajit Pawar, who held a meeting with Shiv Sena and Congress to form the government till late evening, formed the government on Saturday morning with Devendra Fadnavis
 haalanki unhone ensipi ke jin vidhayakon par bharosa karke sharad pavaar se baghawat kii thi, wo bhi unka saath nahin die
 The NCPK rebel MLA returned to him again with a voice of the party chief
 iske baad ajit pavaar akele pad gaye
 Meanwhile, efforts by NCP leaders to persuade him continued and the effort paid off when he resigned as deputy CM and had to return to Sharad Pawar again
 shivasena, ensipi or congress milakar sarkaar banane kii ore agrasar hai
 Previously, where he was expected to get the post of Deputy CM in the Congress, Shiv Sena and NCP governments, now that too seems to be over
 shuukravaar shaam tak charchaa thi ki shivasena, ensipi or congress kii sarkaar main ajit pavaar dipti siem banenge, lekin baghawat ke chalate unhen in teenon dalon kii saajha sarkaar main shaayad hi koi pad mili
 It was clear from this whole battle that the elder Pawar was heavy, Ajit Pawar still needs to learn a lot from his uncle Sharad Pawar
 bijepi ke saath jane ke faisle se ajit pavaar kaa kad naa keval parivaar main balki party main bhi kam hua he
 After rebelling with Sharad Pawar, Supriya Sule said that the family always supported brother Ajit Pawar but he rebelled
 raajnneeti ke diggaj khilaadi sharad pavaar ne apane bhattije ajit pavaar ko hi apana raajnneetik uttaradhikari ke rup main taiyaar kiya tha
 But for some time, Sharad Pawar started to pursue daughter Supriya Sule
 parivaar main saamanjasy ke liye sharad pavaar ne ajit pavaar ko maharashtra or beti supriya sule ko dilli kii raajnneeti karne kaa jimmaa saunp rakhaa tha
 But now Ajit Pawar may also be stripped of the responsibility of Maharashtra
 ajit pavaar se sharad pavaar is had tak naaraaz hai ki somvaar ko unhone yahaan tak kah diya tha ki wo unke khilaaf karrwai karenge or wo (ajit pavaar ) kisi prakaar kaa faisla nahin le sakenge
 Sharad Pawar took the first action against Ajit Pawar on Saturday, when he took over from Ajit Pawar as the Legislature Party leader

 raajnneeti par internet latifon ke is daur main main bhi apana chota-sa vinamr yogadan karnaa chahta hum
 If Chetan Bhagat had written a book on the emergence of BJP in Maharashtra today, what would have been his name? Apparently, 'two Half Girlfriends
 ' chunki unhen apane sheershakon main ginati itani pasand he, lihaaja or bhi behatar hota agar vah is kitaab kaa naam rakhte, '123 or do half garlfrends
 'I don't know how much it has the potential to woo the internet market, but it is definitely a better way to express the bjp's amazing non-dilemma in the country's second largest state
 maje kii baat yah he ki isse parajeet or thukraa di gai congress party kii haalat kaa bhi pataa chalata he
 How is this and why do we call it non-confusion of BJP
 2014 ke chunaavon se itnaa to sabit ho gaya he ki jahaan tak rajnatik rangamanch kii baat he, is par philhal sirf ek sho kaamyaab he or vah he bijepi
 This was already manifested before many people were brought up
 lekin ab sharad pavaar or unki ensipi ke jamaavade ne jis chaturaai se bina shart paala badla he, vaisaa hamaari raajnneeti main pehle nahin hua
 Since we had a political history even before the Internet and Google and since elections have been held in Haryana as well, it is tempting to compare it with Bhajanlal's historical defection
 1980 kii garmiyon main indira gandhi kii satta main vaapasi ke saath hi haryana main bhajanlaal ne apane tamaam vidhayakon ke saath janata party chhodkar congress main samuhik dalbadal kar liya tha
 In this way a Janata Chief Minister and his cabinet became a Congressman overnight
 pavaar kaa paala-badal utana bhavy or shandaar prathit nahin hota, lekin vishuddh moti chamadi kii besharmi ke maamle main unhone bhajanlaal ko peeche chhod diya he
 Bhajanlal had at least the advantages of bargaining
 pavaar to haath main bheekh kaa katoraa liye bijepi kaa darwaja khatkhata rahe hai
 This reflects the condition of one of our two girlfriends
 duusari kii haalat to or bhi dayaneey he kyonki pavaar ke vipareet (jinaki raajnneeti hameshaa 'lacheelee’ rahi he—yaad kiijie ek baar pranab mukherjee ne yah kahkar ki pavaar hameshaa mili-jule sanket dete hai, kitni kushaagratha se unka nakh-sikh varnan kiya tha), shivasena kii raajnneeti, or main kahuunga ki arthvyavastha bhi, gidadbhabhaki, dabangai or garajadaar laffaaji par aadhaarit rahi he
 This election result has pierced his balloon
 us ekmaatr rajya main jahaan uskaa mahatv he, vah aakhirkaar bijepi kii bi-team banane kii bechaargi tak simat gai he
 Its influence has become so weak that it was never in Balasaheb's time, despite not being close to power
 agar vah bijepi se dur rahati he to vrihad mumbai nagarpalika (biemasi) kaa aadhipaty bhi ganvaa degi jo uski raajnneeti kaa vittiya eendhan he
 It is generally said that the most important thing about the latest election results is the Narendra modi-amit Shah pair's determination to contest alone in both the states
 lekin yah baat jaraa zyada gudh he
 It is a story of bjp's focus, strategic vision of its leadership and commitment to its cadres
 vah maharashtra main haashiye kii khilaadi thi or phir pramod mahajan kii hatya bhi uske liye ek jhatka thi
 Even then, she did not dig her way agar aap ek ke baad ek hue chunaavon ke nateezon kaa saavdhaanee se adhyayan karen to aap bijepi kaa vot pratishat or siten lagaataar badhati hui dekh sakate hai
 The same trend was evident in the 2009 assembly elections
 vah shivasena ke kurte kaa konaa pakadakar tab tak lataki rahi jab tak use jarurat thi or ab use uskaa haq dene se inkaar karne kaa dhong karke tang kar rahi he
 The desire to blame only Uddhav Thackeray is natural for this downfall
 lekin shivasena ko aage-peeche se benakaab kar dene vaali ranneetik mahabhul khud bala sahib ne kii thi, jab unhone maharashtrawaad kii jameen par khadi party kii aadharbhumi ko badalakar use hinduvad kii jameen par khadaa kar diya tha
 The Shiv Sena originally moved forward by countering the Left's hold on the trade unions of Mumbai and the Congress at that time also used it happily against a common enemy
 aisi bhi khabaren thim ki sena ne kabhi-kabhaar chunaavon main bhi congress ke saath 'milakar kaam kiya’ tha
 As long as she spoke, molested and harassed Marathi manoos, she held her place
 lekin jis din bala sahib ne hindutv kaa daaman thama, sambhavat: 1992 main babari masjid ke vidhwans se prerit hokar, usee din se shivasena bijepi kii sahaayak ban gai
 This worked till the time was in the hands of vajpayee-advani's gracious generation
 unhone ek udaar, secular, samaveshi mukhauta kaayam rakhaa or unke daahine baaju main shivasena apni harkaton se surkhiyaan bator sakati thi
 But Modi's rise changed all that
 ve hindutv ke asli, pashchaatap-viheen pravaktaa the or shivasena rajya main kisi surat main unase nahin lard sakati thi
 It was too late now to return to Maharashtrianism
 uddhav ne apane varisht partijanon ke saamne mana tha ki yah mahabhul thi lekin unke saath teen samasyaayein thim
 One, his stature was not high enough to overturn the stance established by Balasaheb
 do, unke chachere bhai raaj pehle hi nanus kii sharan main chale gaye the
 And three, he left it too late, the choice before him was that either he would make strategic improvements in the middle journey or opt for Ekla Chalo Re after breaking ties with BJP
 is bich bijepi unke ilaake main ghuspaith or atikaraman karti rahi
 Modi can now sit comfortably and form a minority government and challenge the Shiv Sena to vote with the Congress and show the government down
 awwal to ensipi, jiske liye yah jivan-maran kaa prashn he, aisa hone nahin degi
 And if it is allowed to happen, then the remaining of the Shiv Sena in the new election will also be destroyed
 ab aap samaj gaye honge ki bijepi half garlfriend ke taur par donon ke saath khilaunon kii tarah kyon khel sakati he
 a completely different strategy was adopted in Haryana
 kuldeep bishnoi kii party ke saath koi nishtha nahin thi or loksabhaa chunaavon se pataa chal chukaa tha ki uski kitni ahmiyat thi
 The audacity of the BJP was that it also denied Chautala and a firm victory with him
 usne apni kismat or himmat ke bharose aage badaae kaa faisla kiya or vah bhi us rajya main jahaan usne khud apane chunaav chinh par (jansangh ke rup main, 1967 main) kabhi 90 main se 13 se zyada siten nahin jiti thim
 The BJP was the only new option in front of voters who were drawn to quarrelsome dynastic politics
 yah maanakar chalanaa chahie ki is kamyaabi se prerit hokar ab vah aakhri rajnatik saathi akali dal se bhi apane ko dur kar legi
 And why not, after all, the Akali Dal is also a dynastic enterprise from which voters have come alive
 isaki tulana un rajyon main congress ke pradarshan se kiijie jinaki lagaam yaa to sahyogi dalon ke saath yaa sidhe uske haath main thi
 He has been associated with a Dravidian ally in Tamil Nadu for decades
 lekin rajya main khud apni maujuudagi, kader or saakh sthapit karne main vah is kadar naakaam rahi ki 2014 main jab use kisi party kaa saath nahin mila to vah puri 39 siten haar gai
 Its state organization does not exist, nor does the leader
 tamilnadu mahatvapurn udhaaharan he kyonki yahaan dashakon se indira or rajeev gandhi ko bharpoor pyaar or aadar miltaa rahaa he
 But his party, with its Kahli and Aramtalbi, put the state in the footsteps of a local ally
 bharose kii kami isse spasht he ki rahul gandhi ne yuva congress ke lakhon sadsy banaae, jisamen 90 fisadi alag ho gaye
 Compare this with the bjp's achievement which it has achieved in Maharashtra in a similar situation
 simandhra main (ek or bada rajya jahaan congress kaa may ke chunaavon main safaya ho gaya tha) or pashchim bengal main bhi party apane se tuutakar alag ho gaye netaaon (kramash: vaai
 s
 jaganmohan reddy or mamata banerjee) ko apni rajnatik jameen hathiyaate hue dekhati rahi
 The BJP is now taking its place as the dominant national party in both states and in the face of satraps, it has left the only option to fight or accept its supremacy

 ' sarkaar kii duvidhaayen do hai
 One is in the minority in Rajya Sabha
 duusare vaaki wo ye paigaam nahin dena chaahati ki wo kisaan virdohi he
 The problem is that the NDA government is surrounded on this issue from the farm to the Parliament
 iske baavjood agar sarkaar is bill ko loksabhaa main pesh karti he to ye ek raajnneetik daanv hoga or aisa karne se pehle sarkaar ko isse hone vaale napha-nuksaan kaa sahi andaaza lagaana hoga
 It is important that the bjp's ally Shiv Sena is also hesitant to openly support the government on this controversial bill
 party ke saansad anil desai ne enditivi se kaha, 'abhi dekhnaa hoga ki kis tarah se ye bill teble hoga, kis tarah se sanshodhan rakhe jaaenge, is par abhi kuch bhi zyaada nahin kah sakate
 This bill table is not even done yet
 ' The government's dilemmas are two
 ek to wo rajyasabha main alpamat main he
 Secondly, she does not want to give the message that she is anti-farmer
 mushkil ye he ki is masale par endie sarkaar khet se sansad tak ghiri hui he
 Despite this, if the government introduces this bill in the Lok Sabha, then it will be a political bet and before doing so, the government will have to guess the profit and loss of it

 Date 30 January 1948
 din shuukravaar
 The morning of this day was similar to the normal morning of January
 lekin shaam hote-hote yah din puure desh ke liye manahoosiyat le aayaa
 Mahatma Gandhi was killed on this date
 hatyare nathu ram godse kii teen goliyon ne mahatma gandhi kii jeevanalila isi din samaapt kar di thi
 Mahatma Gandhi's personal secretary v Kalyanam was also with Bapu on this day
 unhone 30 janvari ko tadake saadhe teen baje gandhiji ke jaagane se lekar unki hatya ke aadhe ghante baad tak jo-jo hua wo sab likhaa he
 By reading what v Kalyanam has written about this day, you start living that day
 har kisi ko yah lekh padhanaa chahie kyonki apane ateet main hui galatiyon ko dekhnaa-samajhnaa or unka saamana karnaa jaruri he
 So let us quickly know what things Mahatma Gandhi said and to whom on the last day of his life
 is din bhi baapu hameshaa kii tarah hi tadake saadhe teen baje jag gaye the
 As usual he prayed in the morning
 iske baad roj kii gatividhiyaan shuru ho gayi
 The situation in Delhi was far from normal in those days
 har taraf dange-fasaad ho rahe the, mahatma gandhi is vajah se bahut dukhi the
 Among the celebrities who came to meet Gandhiji that day was Mrs
 RK Nehru
 ve subah chah baje ai thim or dopaher main unhen america janaa tha
 At his request, Gandhiji gave him a photo with his signature on which it was written, 'you are the representative of a poor country and therefore you should be there in a simple and frugal manner
 ’kareeb do baje life magazine ke mashhoor photographer margret bark ne gandhiji kaa saakshaatkaar liya
 During this, he asked, 'you have always said that i would like to live for 125 years
 yah ummid aapako kaise he?’gandhijika jawaab unhen hairaan karne vaala tha
 He said that now he has no such hope
 jab margret ne isaki vajah poochi to unka kahana tha, ‘kyonki duniya main itani bhayanak chijen ho rahi hai
 i do not want to live in the dark
 ’margret ke jane ke baad professor enaar malkani do vyaktiyon ke saath aae
 Our Deputy High Commissioner Malkani in Pakistan told Gandhiji the plight of Hindus of Sindh
 unki baat dhairya ke saath sunne ke baad gandhiji ne kaha, ‘agar logon ne meri suni hoti to ye sab nahin hota
 People do not believe what i said
 phir bhi jo mujhe sach lagata he main kahata rahata hum
 i know that people are starting to think of me as an old man
 ’birla bhawan ke get par uskaa apana chaukeedaar bhi tainaat rahata tha
 Objections were raised to the recitation of Quranic verses during Gandhiji's meetings last year and Sardar Patel, as a home minister, ordered the appointment of a head constable and four constables at Birla Bhavan, taking precautionary measures
 20 janvari kii prarthana sabha main ek bam dhamaakaa hua tha
 The bomb was thrown by a Punjabi refugee named Madan Lal
 lekin yah gandhiji ko nahin laga
 a wall was broken by this
 lekin gandhiji ko kabhi nahin laga ki koi unhen maarane aayaa tha
 Still the police felt that the life of the Mahatma was in danger, so the number of police forces deployed in Birla Bhavan was increased
 haalanki police suraksha vyavastha ko or majboot karnaa chaahati thi or is vaaste prarthana sabha main aane vaale har vyakti kii talaashi lenaa chaahati thi
 But Mahatma Gandhi categorically refused to do so
 lekin police diaiji is baat se santusht nahin the or dopaher ke vakt wo khud birla bhawan aa gaye
 The DIG told Mahatma Gandhi that his life was in danger, so the police should be allowed to do their work
 iske jawaab main baapu ne kaha, 'jo aazaadee ke bajaay suraksha ko praathamikta dete hai unhen jeene kaa haq nahin he
 'instead of people agreeing to search, they will stop the prayer meeting
 shaam main paanch baje mahatma gandhi ko apni prarthana ke liye baahar lon main janaa tha
 But before that about four o'clock, the country's Home Minister Sardar Patel arrived there with his daughter
 patel ko gandhi ne hi bulaayaa tha kyonki wo unase baat karnaa chaah rahe the
 When Patel reached Birla Bhavan, Bapu was having food
 bhojan par hi baapu or patel kii baatcheet shuru ho gai
 This conversation continued even after five o'clock
 baton kii ahmiyat or gambhirtha ko dekhte hue hamamen se kisi kii bhi bich main bolne kii himmat nahin hui
 Abha and Manu gestured to Sardar Patel's daughter Maniben and the conversation ended at five ten
 iske baad gandhiji shauchalay gaye or phir fouran hi prarthana vaali jagah kii taraf bad chale jo kareeb 30-40 gaj kii duuri par rahi hogi
 While going to the prayer meeting, Gandhi was scolding Abha and Manu
 ve isliye naaraaz the ki prarthana ke liye der ho rahi he, yah unhen kyon nahin bataaya gaya
 He used to say, 'I am late
 mujhe yah acha nahin lagata
 When Manu said that she did not want to interrupt it in view of such a serious conversation, Gandhiji replied, "it is the duty of the nurse to give medicine to the patient at the right time
" agar der hoti he to marij kii jaan ja sakati he
 Unaware of the presence of Nathuram, his health in the crowd, Mahatma Gandhi was proceeding to talk to Aura and Manu when three bullets were fired one after the other and the Mahatma's footsteps stopped
 unka chashma or khadaauun unase dur kahin chhitak gaye
 There was chaos all around
 dopaher main mahatma gandhi ne life magazine ke mashhoor photographer margret bark se kaha tha ki wo ab or nahin jeena chaahate kyonki duniyaan bahut kharaab ho gai he or wo is andhere main nahin rahanaa chaahate
 By evening, he went away from this halfway forever
 bihar ke rohtas jile main golibari kaa ek sansanikhej maamla saamne aayaa he

 dhoni lagaataar kedaar jadhav or anya gendbaajon ko bataa rahe the ki kis tarah gend daalani he, kis ballebaaj kii kamajori kya he
 What Mahi said behind the stump - During the bowling of Kedar Jadhav, Dhoni was constantly saying, "very good, good putting"
 ''aisa hi daal isko, har teesraa ball ye hi rakhana''
 Dhoni also asked Kohli to set the fielding but in his own style
 wo chillaaye, '' chiku, do-teen jan (fielderon) ko idhar chhod de''
 Let me tell you that Chiku is the name of Virat Kohli

 According to the report, it is ironic that such candidates are being attracted towards the intelligence agencies of the country, who have got less marks in the civil service examinations

 bollywood abhinetri katrina caff ab apana rasta mode rahi hai or bollywood ke nae abhinaytaon ke saath kaam kar rahi hai, jo unase kaaphi junior hai
 Katrina will do the film opposite Sushant Singh Rajput and Aditya Roy Kapur, which will be directed by Abhishek Kapoor
 iske alaava katrina farhaan akhtar ke production main banane vaali film main bhi abhinay karengi, jisamen unke saath siddharth kapur honge
 Katrina had worked with Salman Khan in the 2005 film Maine Pyar Kyon Kiya
 iske baad unki jodi akshay kumaar ke saath kaaphi chamaki or film 'namaste landan' ke baad kai filmon main unke saath kaam kiya
 Meanwhile, she kept doing films like 'yuvraj', 'ek Tha Tiger' with Salman
 katrina ne shahrukh khan ke saath film 'jab tak he jaan' main or aamir khan ke saath 'dhooma 3' main romance kiya
 Be it Saif Ali Khan or Hrithik Roshan, Katrina teamed up with all the big stars of Bollywood and was also successful
 ye sab katrina se kaaphi senior abhinayta hai
 In such a situation, perhaps Katrina is beginning to think that she should do something different and that is probably the reason why she is doing films with junior actors
 vaise bhi katrina ne apane se junior imran khan ke saath jab film 'mere brother kii dulhan' ki thi tab wo film kaaphi chali thi or kaha gaya tha ki katrina film kaa boj apane kandhon par bhi uthaa sakati hai
 This challenge will once again fall on Katrina's shoulders, when her film with Aditya Roy Kapoor and Siddharth is released
 vaise katrina ke liye ab samay aa bhi chukaa he, jab na sirf unhen apana staradam dikhaanaa chahie, balki box offis par kirdaaron ke saath prayog bhi karnaa chahie
 Because even though Katrina may be on the list of successful actress and star till now, her films have always been with big stars and she has been a girlfriend in most of the films
 agar katrina ab juniurs ke saath kaam karti hai to unhen mahatvapurn kirdaar bhi milenge or safalataa kaa shrey bhi

 Kejriwal suddenly left the stage on Sunday and Ramdev claimed that the protocol for the meeting was fixed and that no one would be named as it would bring back black money and focus on corruption issues
 
 haalanki, kejariwal ne kaha, ‘aisa koi protocol nahin tha ki ham kisi kaa naam nahin le sakate
 When i took the names during the speech, i got a chit stating that i cannot take anyone's name
 mujhe nahin bataaya gaya tha ki naam nahin liye ja sakate
 He said that he was not feeling well for the last few days and asked Anna Hazare and Ramdev for permission to leave the venue as he had to take medicines
 unhone kaha, ‘maine unase poocha ki kya main dawa lene ke baad vahaan baith saktaa hum, unhone kaha ki nahin
 'kejriwal said,' Ramdev is a saint
 vah darshanik dhang se sochate hai ki hamen naam nahin lene chahie or hamen keval muddon ke bare main baat kerani chahie
 He is also right and i am also right
 ’unka daawa aise samay aayaa jab kejariwal ke achaanak uthakar chale jane se navgathit ramdev-anna hajaare gathbandhan main daraaren dikhaai deen
 Ramdev had issued a statement on Sunday night saying, 'we want to carry out the movement with dignity

 ' maharashtra main congress-ncp-shivasena kya saath aaengeshivsena ke saath jane ko lekar congress main suspencemaharashtra main shivasena, ensipi or congress ke bich sarkaar banane ko lekar abhi tak sahmati kaa formula nahin ban sakaa he
 The Congress is making a ruckus in Maharashtra and is embroiled in an alliance with the Shiv Sena
 dharmanirpekshata camp kii aguai karne vaali congress ke liye ugr hindutv kii pairokari karne vaali shivasena se haath milaane ke daag kaa khatra he
 Also, coalition politics does not suit the Congress very much
 yahi vajah he ki maharashtra sarkaar main hissedari ke ofer ke baavjood congress kashmakash main fansi hui he
 Please tell that first BJP and later Shiv Sena in Maharashtra could not stake claim to form government in due time
 maharashtra main shivasena, ensipi or congress kii somvaar ko hui marathon baithak kaa koi nateeja nahin niklaa sakaa he
 The crisis is about to form a government in Maharashtra
 jabaki, shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ne khud phone kar sonia gandhi se sarkaar banane ke liye samarthan maanga, lekin congress netaa kasee venugopal ne ise mahaj 'shishtachar vaarta' kaa naam diya
 At the same time, the Congress believes that the delay in Maharashtra government is not from their side, but from NCP Chief Sharad Pawar
 iske peeche congress kii theory he ki sharad pavaar chaahate hai ki donon partiyon shivasena or ensipi ko dhai-dhai saal siem pad mili
 That is, the post of CM should be rotational
 vahiin, shivasena abhi bhi aditya thakare ko mukhyamantri bananaa chaahati he
 The danger of slipping minority votes is not coming to the fore with the Congress Shiv Sena
 vah shivasena ke bajaay ensipi ke jariye baat kar rahi he
 Congress has put the responsibility of alliance in Maharashtra on Sharad Pawar's shoulders
 darasal congress kii raajnneeti kii chintaa he ki shivasena se saath jane paralpsankhyak mat kahin naaraaz na ho jaae, kyonki shivasena shuru se hi ugr hindutv kii raajnneeti karti rahi he
 His dream of secular alliance at the center of the Congress will remain unfulfilled
 is tarah se congress ko yah dar sata rahaa he ki shivasena kaa haath milaanaa gale kii fans ban saktaa he
 The threat of the North Indian vote is a worry for the Congress that the North Indian vote may not get upset if it joins the Shiv Sena in Maharashtra
 shivasena maharashtra main uttar bharatiyon ko nishaanaa banaati rahi he
 In such a situation, the Congress in North Indian states is in danger of losing their votes if they form a government with Shiv Sena
 isiilie congress kashmakash main fansi hui he
 The thirty-six figure between Bal Thackeray and Sonia Gandhi has been an important role of Shiv Sena founder Bal Thackeray in making the issue of Congress President Sonia Gandhi's foreign origin
 itnaa hi nahin sonia gandhi 1999 se lekar abhi tak shivasena netaaon se milane se parhez hi karti rahi hai
 Former President Pranab Mukherjee wrote in his book 'the Coalition Years 1996 to 2012' that Congress President Sonia Gandhi was angered when she met Bal Thackeray during the presidential election in 2012
 aise main sonia gandhi kis tarah se shivasena se haath milaae is lekar asanmajas bana hua he
 Maharashtra's heavyweight Congressmen do not want alliances Many veteran Congress leaders from Maharashtra have not agreed to tie up with Shiv Sena
 unhen lagata he ki ensipi or shivasena kii sarkaar banane main congress madad karti he to donon kshetreey partiyaan maharashtra main majboot ho jaaengi
 In such a situation, the situation of Congress will be similar to Uttar Pradesh
 congress ne upi main sapa or basapa ko samarthan diya tha
 As a result, the Congress has not been able to return to UP yet
 supreme court ke aadesh ke baad teesri baar khulne ja rahe sabarimala mandir main pravesh karne kii baat kehane vaali tripti desai or unki 6 sahyogiyon ko kochi airport se baahar nahin nikalne diya ja rahaa
 At the same time, the Kerala government is trying to build consensus on the court's decision, but the opposition is not ready

 Also, the auto drivers there have refused to take them to the temple

 He told his son Dharmendra of good luck
 dharmendra or uske kai rishtedaar use manaane kii koshish karte rahe lekin wo nahin mana
 Dharmendra used to pray a lot to convince his father Tarachand
 lekin tarachand is baat par aapa kho baitha or bete dharmendra ke saath kahasuni ke baad usne apni bandook nikaali or dharmendra par firing kar di
 Dharmendra fell on the ground as soon as he was shot

 The body of the deceased was hidden by his father and family in a room near Johar

 Police went to Dharmendra's house and questioned the family members
 lekin un logon ne police ko kuch nahin bataaya
 The police became suspicious after seeing the gestures of the family members
 lihaaja police ne shaq ke aadhaar par is maamle kii chaanbin shuru kii
 Meanwhile, on Sunday, police reached the room near Johar, where Tarachand and his family hid Dharmendra's body
 police ne talash ke dauraan kamare se laash baraamad kar lee or use panchnaame ke baad postmortem ke liye bhivani bhej diya gaya

 The producer of the film, Vipul Shah, says, "the sand went to Sonakshi and Akshay's eyes, hair and clothes
 sonakshi ke liye to halaat or bhi kharaab ho gaye lekin akshay-sonakshi or diarector murugados ne is maamle ko halke main liya or is par jamkar hansane lage

 After the departure of Ramlal, who has held the post of National General Secretary (organization) in the BJP for the last 13 years, BL Santosh has now got this responsibility
 bijepi kii ore se ravivaar ko yah jaankaree saarvajanik kii gai
 BL Santosh, till now, was not only the joint secretary general in the party as Ramlal's ally, but also in charge of South India, the responsibility of spreading the BJP in the respective states
 karnataka main sangh ke hardliner prachaarak kii chhavi rakhane vaale santosh chunaavon ke dauraan waar room ke kushal sanchaalan ke liye jane jate hai
 Live are low profile, but are considered to be expert in creating strategies behind the scenes
 haalanki unki safagoi kai baar bijepi ko asahaj bhi kar jaati he
 BJP president Amit Shah too has had to intervene several times in the past over his political encounter with Yeddyurappa in Karnataka
 ejeeniyar, avivaahit or prachaarkkarnataka ke shivamoga jile se naata rakhane vaale bi el santosh peshey se chemical ejeeniyar rahe hai
 The RSS ideology was so entwined in the mind that the engineer gave up his intention of settling home
 avivaahit rahete hue biel santosh sangh ke purnakalik prachaarak ban gaye
 He continued to play roles in the Union and allied organizations in half a dozen states of South India including Karnataka
 bijepi main aae to BSY na suhaeareses ne prachaarak ke rup main kaam karne vaale biel santosh ko baad main bijepi main bhej diya
 He then went on to become the organization general secretary from the RSS quota in the Karnataka Pradesh Sangathan
 2008 ke vidhansabha chunaav main biel santosh ne parde ke peeche rahakar puri ranneeti taiyaar kii thi
 As a result, when the BJP won the election, power was lost in this province of the south
 magar baad main biel santosh kii yediurppa se khatpat shuru ho gai
 He continued to see Yeddyurappa's image as a threat to the party
 raamalaal kii jagah biel santosh banaae gaye bijepi ke sanghathan mahasachivajab 2011 main jameen vivaad main yediurppa fanse to unhen siem pad se istipha dena padaa tha
 It is said that Yeddyurappa had to resign on behalf of BL Santosh due to tying up and pressurizing the central leadership
 tab se donon ke bich dooriyaan or bad gayi
 After the increase in sourness, BJP called BL Santosh as Joint General Secretary in the national team
 sutron kaa kahana he ki biel santosh bhale hi ab bijepi kii raajnneeti main hai, lekin vah vibhinn muddon par stand prachaarak vaala hi lete hai
 Yeddyurappa's politics in Karnataka has expressed resentment many times, describing the party's image as spoiler
 yahaan tak ki bijepi adhyaksh amit shah jab loksabhaa chunaav ke pehle bangalooru ke teen divasiy daure par pahunche the to unhone santosh or yediurppa ko ek saath baitaakar unase milakar kaam karne kaa vaada liya tha
 But still the distance between the two leaders did not decrease
 soshal media par sakriy rahane vaale santosh kaa chunaav ke dauraan ek fasebuk post bhi charchaa main rahaa tha, jisamen unhone kaha tha ki team bhaavana se kaam na karne vaale safal nahin hote
 This comment was seen linking to Yeddyurappa
 haalanki yediurppa camp aarope lagaataa rahaa he ki bhale hi biel santosh rashtriya team main hai, magar nigaah unki karnataka par hi rahati hai, vah bijepi main yediurppa kii jagah khud ko siem pad kaa daavedaar hote dekhnaa chaahate hai, jabaki biel santosh camp ke log is baat ko kaarij karte hue kehete hai, 'vah purnakalik prachaarak hai, karnataka main bijepi sanghathan kii chintaa karne kaa matlab siem pad kii mahatvakanksha nahin he
 "why is the post of General Secretary Organization important? There may be many national general secretaries in the Bharatiya Janata Party, but the post of General Secretary Organization is one

 isi tarah pradeshon main bhi sanghathan mantri kaa pad sirf aresas prachaarak yaa prishthibhumi se jude vyakti ko hi miltaa he

 With the formation of the DNA Profiling Advisory Committee, in 2003, for the first time, an attempt was made to regulate DNA technology
 isi ke aadhaar par ek draft bill banaaya gaya he
 In 2012, another expert committee was formed which covered issues related to privacy and amended the draft
 iske baad july 2017 main lau kamishan ne ise manjuuri de di lekin niztaa se jude kai mudde aise the jise lekar bahes chal rahi he or maamla supreme court main lambit he
 a month later in August 2017, a 9-member bench of the Supreme Court declared in one voice privacy as a fundamental right under Article 21 of the Constitution
 diene technology regulation bill 2019 ko isi saal janvari main loksabhaa se paas kara liya gaya lekin tab ye rajyasabha se paas nahin ho paaya or ye bill radd ho gaya
 When the Modi government returned to power with increased power, it has once again been introduced in the Rajya Sabha in July 2019, it is yet to be passed by the Lok Sabha
 bill main kya he?bill main diene technology ke jariye vishesh category ke logon jinamein peedit, gunahagaar, sandigdh, under trial, laapata or bina pahchaan ke mrit vyaktiyon kii pahchaan sthapit karnaa he
 The bill aims to regulate laboratories for DNA testing, create DNA data banks at the state and national levels, and a DNA regulatory board
 diene niamak bordais board ko sachiv str ke adhikari head karenge, board main diene vigyaan se jude tamaam vaigyanik, forencik or kanoonee maamalon ke jaankaar or sabhi police or suraksha agenciyon ke top adhikari jaise enie ke diji, sibiai ke diarector or roteshan ke aadhaar par tamaam rajyon ke dijipi or rashtriya maanavadhikaar board ke adhyaksh honge
 Primary responsibilities of the board - Helping the government to create DNA labs, data banks, guidelines and general rules for running these data banks - Recognition of DNA labs - Helping investigating agencies in cases of foreclosure - Special cases of privacy Take care - the cases which are in the power of the Board cannot be brought under the jurisdiction of the court
 diene data kaa klection or istemalbil ke mutabik diene jaanch kii ijaajat sirf kisi vyakti kii pahchaan sabit karne ke liye kii ja sakati he jaise:--ipisi ke tahat aise cese jahaan diene test se jaanch main madad ho
 - Trafficking, Human Trafficking, Abortion, Domestic Violence, Atrocities against Dalits and Tribals and Motor Vehicle Act - Family Cases, Child Identification and Pedigree, Human Organ Transplant, Identification of Person During Immigration - Medical Disturbances, Identification of Dead Person and No permission is required from the accused in cases related to death sentence or punishment above 7 years for unclaimed child DNA sample
 But the lesser punishment cases require the consent of the accused
 khaastaur par agar vyakti aaropee ho yaa laapata vyakti kaa rishtedaar ho
 In the case of handicapped and minor, written consent of family or guardian is required
 kisi bhi maamle main manaa karne par magistrate se madad lee ja sakati he
 Removal of DNA profile- The bill provides that if a person is neither a suspect nor an accused, once the DNA test is completed, his profile can also be removed on written request from the data bank
 sajaa or jurmaana– bina bataaye yaa bina sahi anumati liye diene sample lene yaa uskaa istemaal karne par teen saal kii sajaa yaa 1 lakh tak kaa jurmaana ho saktaa he vahiin diene nasht karne, badlaav karne yaa usamen chhedchhad karne main 5 saal kii jail yaa 2 lakh tak jurmaana ho saktaa he
 Why was the bill brought? While presenting the bill, reasons were given that DNA technology will have a tremendous impact on the judicial process in civil and criminal cases
 faujadaari ke maamalon main jaivik sabooton jaise rape cese main visra, hatya ke maamalon main khun or anjaane khat ke maamle main thook kii jaanch kii ja sakegi
 DNA tests will prove useful in civil cases such as victims of disaster and plane crashes
 diene jaanch kaa galat istemaal na ho iske liye niamak jaruri hai jisase samaaj yaa kisi vyakti kaa nuksaan na ho
 Dr
 Gaurav Aggarwal, a forensic medicine and law expert from Delhi, has raised many questions on this bill, which stood on the privacy and data security in the country
 unke mutabik diene profiling aadhaar kii tarah banataa jayega or dhire-dhire puure samaaj ko apni chapet main le legaa
 Dr
 Aggarwal said, "government's intention may be right, but we are now moving towards becoming a country under government supervision
" misaal ke taur par civil cese main diene profile kii koi jarurat nahin he, finger print hi kaaphi hai
 In many cases, it is better than DNA testing, as in the case of twins, DNA will be one, but finger prints will be different
 'saath hi unka kahana he ki diene sample rakhane kii jarurat nahin he
 It can be misused later
 sandigdhon ke diene sample lene kii ijaajat nahin di jaani chahie
 DNA samples are taken only in the most dangerous types of crimes worldwide
 na ki kisi bhi tarah ke sandigdhon ke sample liye jate hai
 DNA data can be hacked and once ready the digital data never expires, even after erasing it can be retrieved back again
 dow agarwal maanate hai bharat ko pehle niztaa or vyaktigat data ko bachaane se jude kanoon banane kii jarurat he
 Especially when the Supreme Court has declared privacy a fundamental right
 wo chetavanee bhi dete hai or kehete hai, 'kade kanoonon kii kami or niyamon kii gairmaujuudagi ke chalate bharat main diene sample ke galat istemaal kaa bada khatra he
 Whether mps listen to these warnings or not will be known only when this bill goes to the Parliamentary Committee
 vaise rajyasabha ke sabhapati venkaiya naidu ne vipaksh ko bharosa diya he ki iskaa khaas khyaal rakhaa jayega
 Can the stone be the answer to the bullet and the bike be the answer to the gun? Strange to hear, but what to do, Delhi Police has done the same
 dilli kii sadak par bike se stant kar rahe naujavaanon ko kaabo karne ke liye police ne sidhe goli hi daag di
 One youth died in the firing, while the other was injured
 darasal ye vahi bikers the, jo dilli kii sadakon par khaas din or khaas maukon par nikalate hai or sadak par stantbaaji shuru kar dete hai
 This is obviously a violation of law, but its punishment cannot be death
 desh kii rajdhani dilli
 
 
 And Delhi's most important, most special, most safe, most VVIP area
 kuch sau meter kii duuri par sansad bhawan, to kuch faasale par raashtrapati bhawan
 Between all this India Gate and adjoining Ashoka Road
 vahi, jahaan bijepi kaa mukhyalay he
 You must have understood from the place and name how much VVIP the area is
 zaahir he, phir aisi jagah par police kii suraksha bhi waisi hi hogi
 Some amateur stunters juggle on the open road with their bikes on special occasions in the dark of night
 isamen koi shaq nahin ki chalati sadak par is tarah kii stantbaaji galat he, kanoon ke saath khilwaad he
 But even his punishment and death cannot be done? But this is what happened
 dilli kii sadak par khuleam bike par kartab dikhaa rahe naujavaanon ko kanoon todane kii sazaa di gai goli markar
 Delhi Police shot
 haalanki yahi bikers isi jurm main kanoon todate pakade jate, to shaayad thane se hi jamaanat lekar ghar chale jate, kyonki inke jurm kii sazaa goli to nahin ho sakati
 2 of night on 27 July
 30 baje gol daakkhaana kaa ilaaka
 Just like every saturday-sunday night, about 30 to 40 bike riders gather at the round post to perform tricks on the bike
 par is raat pehle se india get ke aasapaas police mustaid thi
 The reason for this was that the news of these bike riders' feats constantly came to the media and questions were raised about the helplessness of Delhi Police
 lihaaza police ne is baar thaan liya tha ki wo in bikers kii manamaani ko rokegi
 So as soon as the bikers gathered at the round post office and started doing tricks, then someone called the police on the number 100
 in bikers ko gol daakkhaane se india get tak janaa tha kartab dikhaate hue
 But seeing their fun on the way, someone called the police on the number 100
 kol aate hi pisiar vine maukey par pahunch gai
 The bikers started running after seeing the police coming after them
 ab police or bikers ke bich res shuru ho gai
 The bikers approached Ashok Road near Hotel Le Meridien, but the police were chasing them here as well
 bakaul police, isi bich achaanak kuch bikers ne pisiar vine par pathar phenkane shuru kar die
 
 
 And this is where the police got angry
 police ne patthak kaa jawaab goli se diya
 Delhi Police targeted a biker and opened fire
 goli bike ke peeche baithe noujvaan karan pandeya kii gardan main ja lagi
 He fell down as soon as the bullet hit
 iske baad police ne duusari goli chalaai
 This time the bullet came out touching Puneet Sharma's hand and waist
 baad main donon ko aspataal le jaaya gaya, jahaan karan kii maut ho gai, jabaki punit khatre se baahar he
 The use of a gun instead of a bullet or a bike instead of a stone was annoying
 lihaaza vaardaat ke fouran baad police ke senior afasaron ne safai deni shuru kii ki police vaale bike ke pahie kaa nishaanaa le rahe the, taaki tair pankchar ho jaae
 The youth had no intention of shooting them
 bahut mumkin he ki police sahi kah rahi ho
 But the question is that he could be caught without firing even
 vahaan nahin, to kisi or mode par, phir goli chalane kii itani jalbaaji kyon?police ke tark main kitna dam?ek taraf police kahati he ki bikers pathar maar rahe the
 On the other hand it also says that bikers were running away
 phir yahi dilli police ye bhi kahati he ki usne bhaagate hue bikers ko pakadaney ke liye goli chalaai thi, vah bhi bike ke tair par, na ki bike savaar par
 But the question arises that after all the common youth of Delhi were sitting on the bike, not any fanatic
 phir halaat bhi aise nahin the, to phir goli chalaai hi kyon?police ke pravaktaa rajan bhagat kaa kahana he ki unka iraadaa sadak par stant kar rahe biker kii jaan lenaa nahin tha, balki wo to bike ke tair par goli markar use pankchar karnaa chaahate the
 But it was bikers who suddenly lifted the front wheel of their bike, causing the bullet to the young man sitting on the back of the bike
 yani yahaan bhi galati bikeron kii hi thi
 It is clear from the statement of Bhagat Saheb that the bikers on which the police fired, at least were not facing the police, but they were escaping from the police
 lekin phir bhi police ne unhen peeche se goli maar di
 In such a situation, the question arises that after all what was the need of the police to catch the running youth, who took a dangerous risk like shooting them to puncture the tires of the bike? The bikers doing street stunts were not terrorists or criminals, who were required by the police to catch them
 phir is tarah fyring karne kii akhir kya zarurat thi?dilli police kii maane, to bikeron ne police kii gaadi par patharav kiya tha, jisase kuch pulisavaalon ko chotein bhi ain
 But stopping and throwing stones at the police and running away on a bike are two different things
 yah police hi he, jo ye kah rahi he ki usne tair pankchar karne ke liye goli chalaai
 That is, bikers were running then
 sawaal yah he ki agar biker bhaag hi rahe the, to phir unhen police ne jane kyon nahin diya? yani police kii yah karrwai javaabi or aatmaraksha main kii gai karrwai kam, balki khundak main kii gai karrwai zyaada lagati he
 By the way, runners are as strange as stoning bikers on the police
 saafe-suthere lutiuns zone main bikeron ke paas eent-pattharon kaa hona bhi utana hi sandehaaspad he
 Anyway, after the incident, there were not so many stones and stones on the road, which can be said that the bikers had really left no other way than to shoot for the police
 aise main agar police kii goli se kisi tej raftaar bike kaa tair bhi pankchar ho jaataa tha, to isse hone vaale accident se na sirf biker, balki duusare logon kii bhi jaan ja sakati thi
 This police shot could also be found on an innocent person on the street
 vaise ab is maamle kii jaanch karaae jane kii baat kahi ja rahi he
 It is possible that this investigation may also lead to milk and water of milk, but the boy who lost his life by the police bullet will never come back
 darasal dilli ke naujavaanon kii bike par stantbaazi kaa yah shagal koi nayaa nahin he
 Hundreds of times, they have been in the streets before, but the police never took them seriously
 lihaaza unke hausale badhate gaye
 There was a time when this stunting gave some boys of Delhi a chance to shine on the silver screen
 par zaahir he ki sadakon par saream unki is kartab ko jaays nahin thahaaraay ja saktaa
 Very few people know that among the friends of the hero who is performing the stunts in the song of the 1983 film 'hero', two friends are from this Delhi, who had a hobby of doing stunts on the bike, to come on the silver screen
 phir kya tha? bike par stantbaazi puri dilli or khaaskar puraani dilli ke naujavaanon ke liye ek pansadeeda shagal ban gai
 After this time passed, the situation changed and only one young man from Delhi who did a stunt on a daily bike lost his life with a police bullet
 jab tak yah shagal qaayade-kaanoonon ke daayre main rahaa, sab thik rahaa
 But as soon as the streets came down after breaking the stuntbinding law, problems started
 vaqt-bewaqt or khaaskar parv-tyoharon ke maukon par dilli ke naujavaanon ne sadak ke bichombich stantbaazi kii aisi ravaayat daali ki police ke liye bhi unhen sanbhaalanaa mushkil hone laga
 This is the way for the youth of Delhi to express their happiness and enthusiasm, which has now come to dominate the law
 raat gahraate hi ye bike savaar dilli kii sadakon par apana kabja jamaa lete hai or phir shuru ho jate hai khatarnaak stant
 Although the special day for such stunting is Saturday or Sunday, but on the occasions of festivals such as these young people become more uninterested
 kya guru parab, kya shabe-baraat or kya guru poornima
 
 
 The date witnesses that hundreds of bikers have stunted on the streets of Delhi and the police have been watching everything made of spectacle
 or to or, bharat ke cricket match jeetne par dilli kii sadakon par stantbaazi hoti rahi he
 Just note that these boys do not care about their lives nor did they take law for their fun
 raftaar to raftaar, bahut se ladakon ke sir main par helmet tak nahin he
 It is obvious that while the common people have been troubled by this stunting, the police has also suffered due to the anger of the people due to their Kahili
 lekin phir bhi biker par lagaam lagane ke is maamle ko dilli police hameshaa hi halke taur par leti rahi he
 Now the police, who have awakened from sudden sleep, have broken all the laws and regulations
 jahaan baton or danda se kaam liya ja saktaa he, vahaan police ne goli chalaai he
 And the result has now come to the fore in the death of a biker
 sawaal uthta he ki akhir police ko kisi kii jaan lene kaa haq kisne diya? Recently, during his visit to Wayanad, Rahul Gandhi came to meet the nurse Rajamma Vavathil in Calicut
 ye vahi nurse hai jo rahul ke janm ke samay aspataal main maujuud thim

 5 Stardirector: Anurag Kashyapakalakar: Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Vicky Kaushal and Shobhita Dhulipala: Anurag Kashyap has made a knock with Raman Raghav as director after Bombay Valvett
 unhone jaisaa khud hi kaha tha ki bombai vailvet ne unhen duboya tha to raman raghav 2
 0 will cross them
 shaayad unka kahana sahi tha kyonki is baar ve star par nahin balki kalakaar par bharosa karne ja rahe the
 Bombay Valvet Jahan was a film with big stars like Ranbir Kapoor and Anushka Sharma on its shoulders and a big budget film, but Anurag was the director of both the actors, so the film was battered at the box office
 is baar ve apane chir-parichit andaaj main najar aae or ek dark thriller ke saath the
 While Bombay Valvet had bets on sets, in Raman Raghav, Anurag has made Mumbai and his slums his theme
 ye bhi padhein: film rivyuu: niraash karti he 'X :past is Present'unhone bharosa apane jaanche-parakhe navazuddin siddiki par kiya or navaj ne siddh kar diya ki baat acting kii ho to unka sani dhundhna mushkil ho jaataa he
 After watching the film, it is understood that this film is not of Anurag but of Nawazuddin
 beshak film ke diarector anuraag hi hai, or unhone is kairactor ko gadha he lekin yah navaj hi hai jinhone masti ke liye katl karne vaale ramanna ko parade par jinda kar diya he
 By the way Udta Punjab, Raman Raghav 2
 0 dekhte hue uddi mumbai kii jhalak bhi dekhi ja sakati he
 The film is based on the 1960s psychopath serial killer Raman Raghav who killed around 41 people
 kahani ko maujuuda daur main rachaa gaya he
 Ramanna (nawazuddin) is a psychopath killer and he kills for fun
 vah police ke paas jaakar nau katlon kii jimmedaari letaa he lekin koi us par yakeen nahin karata he
 The scene of the murder that Nawaz takes in the police station is truly memorable
 vaise bhi jitne natural dhang se navaj ne ramanna ke kirdaar ko ukera he utane hi natural dhang se ramanna logon kaa katl karata he
 The film stars Raghavan (vicky Kaushal), a police officer who is a drug addict and lives with a girl Simi (shobhita Dhulipala)
 udhar, ramanna katl karne main laga rahata he to vahiin raghav use pakadaney kii koshish karata najar aata he or police adhikari apane nashe tathaa garlfriend ke saath ulajhata rahata he
 The name of the story is a serial killer, his slaughtered and drunk police officer
 film kii kahani kaaphi khinchi gai he or puri film bahut slo chalati he
 Talking about Interview, the film also gets loose
 katl ke seen kii duration thodi kam ho sakati thi
 If the chemistry of Vicky and Simi was a little mixed, then the film gets sharper and sharper
 yah film sirf ek hi shaks ke kandhon par he or vah navazuddin hai
 Nawaz has set an example on silverscreen about what a psychopath killer can be, which will be difficult to reach in the coming times
 unka bolne kaa andaaj, bhavashoonyata or katl karne kaa tarika dekhakar munh se yahi nikalataa he ki acting ise hi kehete hai
 Vicky Kaushal and Shobhita have also acted well
 vaise bhi film main har vakt agar kisi kaa intjaar rahata he to ramanna hi he
 The budget of the film is about four crores
 bataaya jaataa he
 In this way, the film will not be in loss
 navazuddin ne film relies se pehle hi kah diya tha ki yah film unke liye maansik rup se bahut zyada thakaane vaali thi
 This thing can also be understood very well by this dialogue, 'apun to kya na hai saab is born nocturnal
 hamakaa baap apun ko lomadee bolta tha
 
 bolta he raat main meraa aankh chamakane lagata he
 
 
 'and with Nawaz, he wants to say,' Nobody is far away
 
 
 tu aisa sachcha behuda

 Aaj Tak's campaign against the rigging of railway tickets has brought color
 rail mantralay ne bhi tatkaal tikat booking main dhaandhlee kii baat maan lee he or khabar he ki tatkaal tikat booking niyamon main baari pherbadal kiya ja saktaa he
 Actually, Railways have decided to take this step in the light of the frequent arrests being made in connection with the immediate ticket fraud
 niyamon main bade pherbadal kii taiyaari he
 Several suggestions have emerged
 inamen se kuch ye hai:»booking khidki par pahchaan patr dikhaanaa jaruri ho saktaa he
 This will make it easier to keep the brokers away from the queue
 »baar-baar tikat kataane waalon par rakhi jaaegi nazar
 Thoughts on installing CCTV cameras on ticket windows
 isse booking clerkon se dallalon kii sathganth par bhi kasega ankush
 »time of booking of Tatkal tickets can be changed
 »website par tatkaal aarakshan hoga aasaan, internet tikat ke liye sarwar ko or majboot karne kii taiyaari
 »it is also being expected that there will be no booking of any kind at the time of booking Tatkal tickets
 jisase iarsitisi ke sarwar par sirf tatkaal tikat lene vaale rahenge or kanjeshan kii asuvidha bhi nahin rahegi
 »the reason for the visit will have to be given and the identity card will be mandatory
 »booking farm main likhit naamon ke alaava unase bhi pahchaan patr kii maang kii ja sakati he jo tikat kataane booking counter par gaye hai
 »help is being sought from the cyber experts so that the fraud can be detected in the booking
 »tatkaal kii booking counter kii jagah keval online hi hogi
 »earlier, Tatkal tickets were booked 72 hours ago which was changed to 24 hours earlier
 »rail mantralay tatkaal kii koi or skim jaise ‘imargency tikat’ suvidha laa sakati he
 Before this step is taken, the Railways has made changes in the Tatkal ticket booking process several times
 lekin tatkaal tikat booking main dallalon kaa bolbalaa lagaataar jari he
 What steps have been taken by the Railways to prevent disturbances in Tatkal ticket booking: »railways have banned online agent bookings from 8 to 10 am daily to keep touts from booking Tatkal
 »internet ke madhyam se tatkaal booking ke liye ek form main keval do logon ko tikat milane kii vyavastha bhi kii gai

 90 ke dashak main himachal pradesh ke rajyapal gulsher ahamed ko aachaar samhita ke ulanghan ke chalate istipha dena padaa tha
 Please tell that Kalyan Singh visited Aligarh, his home district on 23 March last month
 is dauraan unhone raajnneetik bayaan diya tha
 Kalyan Singh had said, 'all of us are BJP workers and because of this we would definitely like that BJP wins
 ham sab chahenge ek baar phir se centre main modiji pradhanmantri bane
 Modiji's becoming Prime Minister is necessary for the country and society
 'kalyaan singh ek daur main bijepi ke kaddavar netaa rahe the or maujuuda samay main rajasthan ke rajyapal hai

 Governor Gulsher Ahmed had reached Amarpatan seat to campaign for his son
 iske baad chunaav ayog ne rajyapal ke is kadam ko lekar naaraazgi jaahir kii thi, iske baad gulsher ahamed ko istipha dena padaa tha
 In such a situation, Kalyan Singh's statement is being seen like the Gulsher Ahmed case
 yahi vajah he ki chunaav ayog ne raashtrapati ko sangyaan lene kii baat kahi he
 On the statement of Kalyan Singh, Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot also said in a tweet that the post of Governor is a constitutional post

 - input IANS a shocking case has come to light in Bareilly Cantt area of uttar Pradesh
 jahaan beti kii sasuraal pahunche mata- pita kaa damaad or unke gharavaalon se vivaad ho gaya
 During this time, there was a scuffle
 isi bich gusse main aakar damaad ne apni saas kii naak chaba lee or chaaku se waar kar saas kaa kaan bhi kaat diya
 On receiving the information, the local police reached the spot and the girl's mother was admitted to the district hospital for treatment
 haalat gambhir hone kii vajah se ghayal mahila ko hair centre rafer kar diya gaya
 Actually, the victim's daughter gave birth to a child
 use dekhne hi wo mahila apane pati ke saath beti kii sasuraal ai thi
 In fact, a year ago, a woman resident of Pilibhit was married to Mohammad Ashfaq, resident of Cantt area of bareilly
 kareeb dedh maah pehle unke yahaan ek bete kaa janm hua
 The girl's parents recently reached the girl's in-laws
 ve kuch dinon ke liye beti or damaad ko pilibhit le jane aae the
 But the son-in-law was not ready to send the wife to the maiden
 bas isi baat ko lekar donon pakshon main vivaad ho gaya
 The talk grew so much that the quarrel started
 isi bich damaad ne saas kii naak chaba lee or chaaku se unka kaan kaa kaat diya
 The fight fights and dispute were reported to their neighbors police
 police maukey par pahunchi or susaraal paksh ke 6 logon ke khilaaf mukadmaa darj kar liya he
 But after committing the crime, the girl's in-laws fled the spot
 jab police vahaan pahunchi to aaropee damaad or uske ghar vaale vahaan se bhaag chuke the
 The girl's father has also lodged an FIR against half a dozen people, including his son-in-law

 This time around, Vasundhara Raje is the Home Minister in the government and the current Leader of Opposition Gulabchand Kataria
 yah ittefaq he yaa sajeesh, adaalat tay karegi, lekin vidhansabha chunaav kii sargarmi shuru hote hi gujarat or rajasthan main purv grih mantri par sibiai kaa shikanja kasnaa, ek tathy he
 The cbi's attempt is when the probe agency's reputation has been shaken in the investigation of five important cases related to Rajasthan
 haalia maamla kataaria se judaa he, jin par sibiai ne soharabuddin farji muthbhed maamle main shadyantrkaari hone kaa aarope lagaaya he
 The agency has accused him in a supplementary charge sheet
 kataaria bijepi ke varisht netaaon main se hai, jin par rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (aresas) kaa varadahast he
 Kataria, considered a strong opponent of Vasundhara Raje in the BJP, has recently been given the command of the Leader of the Opposition under the internal agreement and Raje has been made the state president
 ekajutata ke saath chunavi samar main kudi bijepi ke liye kataaria kaa taaja maamla gaharaa jhatka dene vaala he
 This is the reason why the bjp's top leadership, including Raje, has come to the rescue of Kataria and accused the Congress of using unscrupulous CBI

 Shah was arrested earlier in the case and is currently out on bail
 sibiai kaa kahana he ki soharabuddin kii 2005 main hui hatya se pehle usne paatani se 24 karod ru
 Asked, after which Patni asked Kataria for help
 paatani ne india today ko bataaya, ''kisi ne kabhi bhi mujhe koi dhamkee nahin di, kisi ne kabhi phiroti nahin maangi
 i never complained to anyone about it
 main to vaaki is bare main media main ai khabaron se puri tarah se sadame main hum
 Vasundhara Raje is seeing a big conspiracy in it
 16 may ko patrakaron se unhone kaha, ''sibiai ko is saal march tak antim chargeshit daakhil kar deni thi lekin poorak chargeshit kaa abhi daakhil kiya janaa darasal bikaner or jaipur main rahul gandhi ke daure se judaa he
 Party workers have also exposed Gehlot's misrule and fake plans in their meetings
 '' bijepi ne 18 may ko sibiai ke is durupyog ke khilaaf rajyavyapee band kiya
 The party has started capitalizing on the issue as a sympathy
 ek police adhikari kehete hai, ''chaliye maan bhi len ki vah farji muthbhed thi, tab chaahe sarkari theke main bhrashtachar kaa koi maamla ho, hiraasat main maut kaa, police firing kaa yaa laaparvaahee kaa, sab main dijipi, grih mantri or mukhyamantri ko bhi aaropee banaaya janaa chahie
 "the court is yet to come in the Kataria case, but this time also the CBI did exactly what it did in the Jaipur Dara encounter case
" vahaan bhi saare ahm sakshya is aakhri tathy ko pusht karte hai ki daara kii maut police hiraasat main hui
 The CBI cites just one phone call that BJP leader Rajendra Rathod and the then ADG A
 ke
 Jain is in the midst of it, and concludes that Rathore ordered Jain to kill Dara
 jain philhal is maamle main jail main hai
 According to the CBI, Dara was the culprit and threatened to kill Rathore, after which he was killed
 magar soharabuddin maamle kii hi tarah yahaan aisi koi dhamkee se judi shikaayat nahin milti jo rathod ne police main darj karwaai ho
 And there is no evidence to prove that Dara actually threatened
 daara singh ke gangster maalik ko sanyog se police hiraasat main to liya gaya lekin uski hatya nahin hui
 Despite the legal arguments in favor of Rathore, the cbi's action against him has seen the equation of Rajput vote in the state deteriorating and it is believed that it may harm the Congress in the same way as it did to the traders in the Sohrabuddin case
 is
 lekin congress ko shaayad lagata tha ki rathod ke khilaaf sibiai kii karrwai se jat vot unke paksh main aa jaaenge, chunki daara singh jat tha
 But Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot did everything in the Bhanwari Devi murder case
 is maamle main mantri pad se hataae gaye or philhal jail main din kaat rahe jat netaa mahipal maderna ke khilaaf sibiai abhi tak koi saboot nahin juta pai he ki unhone bhavari kii hatya kaa aadesh diya tha
 It is worth mentioning that even after interrogating the main accused Indira Devi in this case, the CBI let her escape
 indira vidhayak malakhan singh bishnoi kii bahan he
 Vishnoi is in jail in this case
 sibiai ne bas itnaa kaha he ki mahipal kii hi tarah bishnoi ko bhi indira ke bulaae ek giroh ne soochna di thi ki bhavari ko maar diya jayega
 The Vishnoi community is difficult to digest
 iske alaava gahalot ke kareebi netaaon or naukarshahon ke bhavari or duusari mahilaon ke saath sambandhon vaali tamaam kathith sidi kaa bhi ata-pataa nahin he
 Bhanwari used to come from the scheduled caste
 yah samudaay bhi gahalot se naaraaz he
 The shadow of politics on the CBI investigation is also evident in two cases related to Muslims
 gopalgarh golibari cond or uske baad hui hinsa main sibiai ne sirf mev or gurjaron ko hi giraftaar kiya he
 After the police firing in September 2011, ten people were killed by the mob attacking the dry fruits before the eyes of the police
 yah golibari jaij thi yaa nahin athwa golibari ke baad mewan kii hatya or unhen jalaae jane kii ghatana ko sibiai ne chuaa tak nahin he
 Similarly, in the Surwal case of Sawai Madhopur, the CBI has failed to bring forward any conspiracy
 yahaan ek mali mahila kii hatya par karrwai na kiye jane ke khilaaf ek acroshit meena yuvak ne kud kar jaan de di thi, jiske baad gussai bheed ne ek police inspector ko jala kar maar daalaa tha
 Muslims are also angry with Gehlot due to these incidents
 lekin taaja prakaran se philhal bijepi kaa focus gahalot sarkaar kii naakaamiyon se hat kar kataaria par kendrit ho gaya he
 The party will now make CBI an issue in the same manner as Narendra Modi made in Gujarat

 ) The formation of a coalition government of BJP and PDP in Jammu and Kashmir has not passed even a week, but there seems to be tension between the two on many issues
 taaja maamla muslim lig ke pramukh or hurriyat ke kattarpanthi netaa masarrat alam kii rihaai kaa he
 The Chief Minister of the province, Mufti Mohammad Sayeed, has formulated a policy of releasing political prisoners with non-criminal charges under his Healing Touch agenda and it is under this decision that Musrat Alam was released
 hurriyat ke is kattapanthi netaa ko saal 2010 main kashmir main faili hinsa kaa jimmedaar mana jaataa he
 About 125 people died in this violence
 alam piese yani public sefti act ke tahat baraamula ke jail main beete chaar saal se band the
 The state police then announced a reward of 10 lakhs for Alam's arrest
 un par aarope he ki unhone hi ghati main suraksha balon par patharbaji kaa abhiyaan chalaaya tha
 If sources are to be believed, the government can release 200 to 300 such people
 jammu-kashmir police ke dijipi ke rajendra ke mutabik unhen aise aadesh mili hai ki jin aatankiyon or alagavaadiyon ke khilaaf aapraadhik maamle naa ho, unhen reeha kar diya jaae
 On this issue, BJP leader in Kashmir Hina Bhatt says, 'mufti Saheb should not forget that he is running a common government and should discuss in cabinet before taking such important decisions
 naa to unhone up mukhyamantri se is masale par baat kii or naa hi bijepi se
 This decision has proved that with whose support Mufti Saheb won the election
 gauratlab he ki pidipi pramukh said jab pehle bhi mukhyamantri bane the to apane healing tach ke tahat saikadon aatankiyon ko raajnneetik bandi ke naam par reeha kar diya tha
 BJP had strongly opposed it then, but now BJP itself is on the backfoot from being a partner in power
 isse pehle mufti ne mukhyamantri banate hi kashmir main shantipurna chunaav ke liye pakistan, hurriyat or aatankwaadiyon ko dhanyavad diya tha
 Later, when there was an uproar in Parliament, then Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh himself clarified that the party and the government did not agree with the opinion of the Mufti
 ho saktaa he ki somvaar ko sansad main vipakshi dal phir yah mudda uthaae or sarkaar ko jawaab dete naa bane
 Of course, this decision of Mufti will strengthen the roots of PDP in the valley, but it does not become a new threat to security
