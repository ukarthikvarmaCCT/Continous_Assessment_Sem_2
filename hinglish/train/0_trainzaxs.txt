 hafiz said khuleam narendra modi kaa khun bahaane kii baat kar rahaa he
 'it's not just the not yet formed "grand Alliance" that desperately wants to stop India from having Modi as it's PM in 2019

 'off course this is not a comparison! Modi Ji's attack on Black money and corruption is getting the opposition in India on one page while his attack on terrorism & surgical strike is pushing Hafeez said to desperation! This proves that the Modi government is moving the right way! https: / / t

 co / iw98agdpgg — Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) April 9, 2016 i am very happy to have achieved the goal, she said she wanted to break the world record of Kalamandalam Hemlata in Kerala (thrissur)
 hemlata ne mohaniattam main yah record banaaya tha
 Significantly, Soni was continuously dancing in the Mount Littra Ji School auditorium in Rohania area of varanasi since last Monday evening
 isse pehle unhone pichley saal 14 november ko varanasi ke arya piji college sabhaagaar main world record banane kaa prayaas kiya tha lekin tabiyat kharaab hone ke chalate unhen bich main hi stage chhodia padaa tha
 Then they danced 87 hours 18 minutes
 dilli main kachare ke pahaad is vakt sabase badi samasya ban gaye hai or ye pahaad dilliwaalon ke gharon se nikle kachare se khadey hue hai
 Jokchara comes out of the houses, lying on the side of the roads, rotting on the slopes and then reaching the landfill sites and turns into a mountain
 kachra rozaana nikalataa he, lekin uske liye ab landphil site nahin he, jo hai wo bhar chuki hai
 In such a situation, there is only one solution to this problem and that is to convert waste into energy
 kyonki jo kachra landphil site par jaakar musiibat banataa he, wo bijli banane ke liye eendhan ke taur par kaam aa saktaa he
 In Ghazipur, waste can be generated from the waste-making plant house, but due to carelessness and government indifference, the garbage is not only going waste, but is also making it difficult for the capital Delhi
 gajipur ke kachare ke pahaad ke paas ek plant main isse bijli banaai ja rahi he
 At West & Energy plant of IF&LS, Delhi's waste waste is not only used as fuel, but also by making electricity and supplying it to homes
 gajipur main 2000 ton rozaana kachare kii khapat kshamta vaala plant pichley saal se shuru hua tha
 However, its operational capacity has been kept at 1300 tonnes per day
 matlab gajipur pahunchane vaale 2500 ton kachare main se 1300 ton kachra is plant main laayaa jaataa he, jise process karke bijli banane ke liye istemaal kiya jaataa he
 Although the number of garbage used to generate electricity is much lower than the waste generated throughout Delhi, it is still a way that can liberate Delhi from garbage
 is plant ke liye kachra bekaar kaa kooda karkat nahin, balki ro material hota he
 The dumping pit is collected in the trash
 The first waste that comes in the dumping pit is the same waste that was dumped in the open at the landfill site, but this waste is processed here
 is pit se kachra kraine ke jariye kanware belt main jaataa he or kanware belt par kachare ko sukhaya jaataa he
 Also, useless things are separated
 iske baad is kachare ko ek saise main banane ke liye process kiya jaataa he
 This part of the plant is the place that has been built, because at present there is no tradition of separating wet and dry waste in homes in Delhi
 agar yahaan sirf sookhaa hi kachra aae, to is hisse kii zarurat kam ho jaaegi
 It will also take less time to make the waste usable
 plant kii paryaavaran prabandhan kii senior manager rachana sharma ke mutabik yahaan kachare ko plant main istemaal laayak banaaya jaataa he, kyonki kooda mix hokar aata he, to ise alag-alag karnaa or sukhaana jaruri ho jaataa he
 The entire processing of waste is kept from the control room, which we throw in our houses as waste and do not like to be kept in the house for long, it is being destroyed as well as electricity is being made from it
 is plant ke sabase mahatvapurn control room main kachare se bijli banane kii prakriya par baariki se nazar rakhi jaati he
 Through this control room, all stages of electricity generation are monitored by reaching the waste system
 yahaan teen camaron ke jariye plant ke bheetar kii tasviir lagaataar milti rahati he
 After drying the waste is burnt at high temperature
 yahaan taapmaana 800 se 1000 degree celsius hota he or is prakriya main kachare se nikalne vaali hanikaarak gaison kaa prabhaav kam ho jaataa he
 Also the gases that remain are neutralized through the condenser
 chunki gajipur kaa plant euro standard par kaam karata he
 Therefore, care is taken to reduce the amount of harmful gases in the smoke coming out of the chimney

 ) Alka Lamba, MLA from Aam Aadmi Party, has once again spoken out of the party line
 dilli sarkaar banaam alji maamle main main supreme court ke faisle ke baad alka lamba ne twit ke jariye ek baar phir se apni hi party par sawaal uthaae hai
 Regarding the news of an alliance between the Aam Aadmi Party and the Congress in Delhi, Alka Lamba said that if the ACB had come into the hands of the Delhi government, would the Delhi government have acted against former Chief Minister Sheila Dixit? In fact, the Supreme Court said in its decision that the Center has authority over ACB, Commission of Inquiry etc
 vahiin bijli or jameen ke cirkil rate par rajya sarkaar kaa adhikaar bataaya he
 The move of the ACB to the Center is a setback for the Delhi government
 dilli sarkaar banaam uparajyapal maamle main supreme court ke faisle ke baad aam aadmi party ke vidhayak saurabh bharadwaj ne twit main likhaa- 'pyaare sanghiyon, shila dikshit kab jail jaaengi, ab modi ji se pucho, or roj pucho
 This tweet was retweeted by Alka Lamba and asked many questions
 alka lamba ne aam aadmi party ko target kiya or likhaa- agar congress se gathbandhan kii baat karne vaale kya asibi milane par congress kii purv mukhyamantri shila dikshit par karrwai karti? yaa phir gathbandhan bachaate? unhone aage likhaa ki twit se sabit hota he ki bijepi kii centre sarkaar karrwai kare yaa naa kare, magar aam aadmi party agar shila dikshit ko bhrasht maanati he to phir gathbandhan kyon?
 Big question: Will the former CM of Congress, Sheila Dixit, take action on meeting the # ACB who is talking about an alliance with the Congress? Yes / no? yaa phir gathbandhan bachaate? The tweet proves whether the central government of the BJP should take action or not, AAP considers Shilaji as corrupt, phir ganthbandhan kyon? https: / / t

 ACB kisi ke paas bhi rahe bhrashtachariyon ke khilaaf kaarywai jarur honi chaiye
 The Modi government neither took any action on its own nor did it allow the Delhi government to do so

 Actually, accused Harnek Singh never gave money to Jaskaran, but Harnek Singh himself had borrowed 40 lakh rupees from Jaskaran
 jaskaran ne kai baar harnek se apane paise maange lekin harnek ne paise dene kii bajaay ek badi or gahari sajeesh rach daali
 By throwing the body into pieces in Punjab, Haranek Singh confessed in police interrogation that after killing Jaskaran on October 14, the body was torn into pieces and thrown into Punjab
 uski is sajeesh main uski patni gurmeher bhi shaamil thi
 If the house came to ask for money, according to the sources, Jaskaran had come to the house on 14 October to ask for money from Harnek Singh and at the same time, Harnek killed him

 ” priti daawa karti hai ki do maheene baad jab ve sabake saamne ain to maano unki umr das saal bad chuki thi lekin unhen sach kehane par garv tha, or ve kisi se nahin darati thim

 The Mumbai Police was in a dilemma to confirm the charge of stalking (stalking) in the absence of CCTV to confirm Preity's allegation and appeared to be the protector of the female interest, so she sent a letter through Preity's lawyer Hitesh Jain to him himself until the next weekend

 The Wadia family, who were an integral part of Mumbai's high society, claimed that the reason for the verbal war between the two was that Preity refused to get up from the seat reserved for Ness's mother Maureen and nephew because Preity did not sit close to them
 Wanted ness kaa janmdin hone kii vajah se wadiya parivaar us din der se aayaa tha

 Life without a true friend seems boring
 aise hi sachche doston kii yaad main har saal agast ke pehle ravivaar ko friendship de manaaya jaataa he
 This year, this festival of friendship is being celebrated on 4 August
 lekin kya kabhi aapane sochaa he ki is din kii shuruyaat kab or kaise hui thi
 Who would have celebrated this day as a friendship first
 agar aapke man ko bhi ye sawaal aksar pareshaan karte hai to chaliye aapaki pareshaani dur karte hue aapako bataate hai ki aakhir kab or kaise hui friendship de manaane kii shuruuaat
 History of Friendship Day - Friendship Day started in America in the year 1935
 kaha jaataa he ki agast ke pehle ravivaar ko america sarkaar ne ek vyakti ko maar diya tha
 In memory of which one of his friends committed suicide
 jiske baad sarkaar ne us din se agast ke pehle ravivaar ko friendship de ke rup main manaane kaa nirnay liya

 joes haal naam ke is vyapaaree ne sabhi logon ke liye ek din aisa rakhaa jisamen do dost aapas main ek duusare ko card dete hue is din ko celibratt kar saken
 To celebrate this special day, the merchant chose the day of August 2

 bijepi or tiemasi ke bich jai shriram ke naare par chal rahi raar par pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee kii safai ke baad nayaa mode aa gaya he
 Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor on Sunday took a dig at Mamta and advised her to chant the name Ram
 kapur ne kaha ki mamata banerjee ko shriram naam mantra likhakar bheja he or unhen use apni mej par rakhane kii salaah bhi di he
 Kapoor said that evil forces have been affected by Mamta Banerjee
 asar is kadar he ki ‘jai shriram’ sunate hi vah chillane lag rahi hai
 He said that there is a clear mention in the Ramayana that if any evil power is affected by the mind of a person, then it can be ended by taking the name of 'lord Ram'
 mamata banerjee ko bhi chahie ki vah ram naam len
 The effect of these powers will reduce on them
 vahiin, pashchim bengal se saansad arjuna singh ke saath mamata ko ram naam likhe post card bhejne kaa abhiyaan shuru karne vaale tejinderpal singh bagga ne kaha ki desh ke vibhinn ilaakon se bhaajapa samarthak 25 lakh postcard ‘jai shri ram’ likhakar bhejenge
 It is worth noting that in 24 Parganas district of West Bengal, on Thursday, Mamata Banerjee had provoked some people shouting 'jai Shri Ram'
 aisa ek baar or chunaav prachaar ke dauraan bhi hua tha
 Didi had given the clarification that the Chief Minister of West Bengal had given clarification on the Jai Shri Ram controversy on Sunday itself
 mamata ne soshal site fasebuk par lanbaa post likh kar kaha tha ki jai siyaaraam, jai ram ji kii jaise dharmik naaron kaa saamaajik mahatv he
 i understand and respect the expressions of these slogans
 mamata ne bhaajapa par baar-baar ‘jai shri ram’ kaa naam lekar dharm ko raajnneeti se mila rahi he
 If a party puts a special slogan in its rallies, then they have no problem
 lekin vah in raajnneetik naaron ko jabaran thope jane ko bardaast nahin karengi
 The BJP is spreading negativity in Bengal through its strategy

 Counting hours are now left for the election campaign to end
 lihaaja, yahaan ke sabhi 90 vidhansabha kshetron main netaa jamkar reliyaan kar rahe hai or janata ke bich ja rahe hai
 The election campaign is also being seen in Noon, Ferozepur Jhirka and Punhana seats in Mewat region
 in siton kii khaas baat ye he ki yahaan se sabhi mukhya dalon kii taraf se muslim pratyaashee chunaav lard rahe hai
 More interestingly, ever since elections have started in these seats, only Muslim candidates have been winning since then
 ferozepur jhirka sitis seat par pehla vidhansabha chunaav 1967 main hua tha
 D
 from here in the first election
 mohammad ne congress ke tikat par chunaav jeeta tha
 Since then, the Muslim candidate has been winning this seat continuously
 is vidhansabha kshetra main hameshaa congress or inelo kaa kabja rahaa he
 INLD has won this seat twice in the 2009 and 2014 elections
 in donon chunaav main naseem ahamed ne jeet darj kii he or is baar naseem ahamed bhartiya janata party ke tikat par chunaav lard rahe hai
 In this case, claims are being made to change the history of this seat
 nunh sitanunh seat bhi mevaat kshetra main aati he
 Like Ferozepur Jhirka, there has always been a Muslim candidate winning the election here
 1967 main nunh se pehali baar rahim khan ne chunaav jeeta tha or vah ek nirdaleey ummidavaar ke rup main lade the
 Even after this, there were many occasions when no major in the state could win from here and a Muslim candidate won as an independent candidate
 2005 ke vidhansabha chunaav main habiburrahman ne nirdaleey ummidavaar ke taur par hi vijay praapt kii thi
 While the seat went to inld's account in 2014 and Zakir Hussain became MLA
 haalanki, is baar jakir hossain bhi bijepi ke tikat par chunaav lard rahe hai
 In such a situation, the battle for this seat has also become very interesting
 haryana chunaav: 2014 ke mukaable daagi ummidavaaron kii sankhya badi, rape ke aaropee bhi maidan main!punhana sitgurugram loksabhaa kshetra ke tahat aane vaali punhana vidhansabha seat 2008 ke parisemen ke baad astitv main ai
 In the first election held in 2009, inld's Mohammad Ilyas defeated Baji Mari and Bahujan Samaj Party's female candidate Dayawati
 haalanki, 2014 ke chunaav main mohammad eliyas haar gaye or nirdaleey ummidavaar ke taur par lade rahis khan ne fatah hasil kii
 This is the reason for the victory of Muslim candidates: The high number of Muslims in Mewat region is the major reason for the victory of Muslim candidates in these three seats
 haryana main muslim matadaata 7
 There are 2 percent, but Mewat has about 70 percent Muslim population
 mevaat kshetra main paanch vidhansabha siten aati hai, jinamein nunh, punhana, ferozepur jhirka vidhansabha seat par muslim matadaata nirnaayak bhoomika main he
 Apart from this, Muslim voters are in the role of Kingmaker in Sohna and Hathin seat
 ferozepur, punhana or nunh main kabhi bijepi ko jeet nahin mili he, lekin is baar party ne do muslim chehron par hi daanv lagaaya he, aise main kaha ja rahaa he ki ye chunaav mevaat ke itihaas ko badal saktaa he

 Angry RJD mlas boycotted the conference midway and left
 sammelan ko sambodhit karte samay upmukhyamantrisushil kumaar modine ek tippanee kii jahaan unhone kaha ki aaj ke din desh ke teen mukhyamantri jail kii hawa kha rahe hai
 The point is clear, Sushil Modi's gesture was somewhere towards RJD supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav and on hearing this comment all the RJD mlas present at the conference started creating a ruckus and left the program shouting slogans
 sammelan se baahar nikalne ke dauraan argedy ke vidhayakon ne mukhyamantri nitish kumaar or susheel modi ke virodh main narebaaji bhi kii or kaha ki nitish-susheel chor hai
 RJD mlas alleged that Sushil Modi made the international program like Commonwealth Parliamentary Union Conference a political platform and commented against Lalu Prasad
 ajtak se baatcheet karte hue argedy vidhayak shakti singh yadav ne kaha ki susheel modi ne rashtramandal sansadeey sangh sammelan jaise kaarykram ko or bihar ko badnaam kiya he, jahaan par is kaarykram kaa aayojan kiya gaya he
 Shakti Singh Yadav said that if the discussion is to be done then Sushil Modi would discuss corruption of BJP and tell how Diamond businessman Nirav Modi escaped from the country with 11 thousand crores? Another RJD MLA Alok Mehta said that Sushil Modi has politicized an international conference and tainted the dignity of this entire conference
 tejasvi ne kaha, susheel modi ne bihar ko kalankit kiyaavahin is maamle main rashtramandal sansadeey sangh sammelan, patna main daagiyon ke sargana susheel modi ne 52 deshon ke pratinidhiyon ke saamne bihar ko kalankit karne kaa kaam kiya he
 Sushil Modi, the largest 420 BJP leader in Bihar, has been involved in many cases
 ye sabase bade ghotalebaz hai
 Tejashwi said that why did Sushil Modi not tell at the Commonwealth Parliamentary Union conference that the Chief Minister of Bihar had a case of serious murder? Chief Minister Nitish Kumar is a convict on charges of stealing the thesis of a JNU student
 bihar kii mantriparishad main 75 fisadi mantri daagi hai
 Tejashwi questioned why Sushil Modi did not say that there were 40 record-breaking scams in Bihar under Nitish's leadership? Why did he not tell that his sister and he had taken crores of rupees in the creation scam
 apana kaala bhrashtachar chhipaane ke liye susheel modi ne is manch kaa prayog kiya
 According to Tejashwi, Sushil Modi should apologize for wiring the parliamentary system
 mukhyamantri se mauni baba bane nitish kumaar ko bhi is ghatana par munh kholana chahie ki kya majaburi he ki unhone aise tarkahin vyakti ko upmukhyamantri bana rakhaa he?gauratlab he ki, argedy netaa or purv upmukhyamantri tejasvi yadav ne pehle hi is kaarykram kaa bycott kar diya tha
 Tejashwi had alleged that in the past, the Bihar government has insulted the family of Bihar resident Constable Mujahid Khan and the deceased soldier who was killed in an encounter with terrorists in Karan Nagar area of srinagar in Jammu and Kashmir, in protest against this Are opposing the program

 chandraprakash ne garima ko kiraye kaa cameraa dilvaaya or usee flats main ek kamare main chandraprakash or doctor rakesh rahane lage
 More than half the rent of the flat was paid by Chandraprakash himself to make a place in the heart of dignity

 For which i tried to take my own life by hanging myself from the rubber trap in the hotel room, then suddenly i realized that if the trap broke and i survived, i would be more self-conscious, what my family would think
 phir mainebijili ke transfarmar se chipakane kii koshish karne kaa man banaaya par tab mujhe laga agar transfarmar ke bijli ke tej jatke se main dur jaakar gira or batch gaya to
 After which i found the fastest flowing place of Ganga with the hotel staff and started committing suicide
 par krime branch kii team lagaataar chandraprakash ko talashne kaa kaam kar rahi thi aurarudaki ke paas ganga ke kinare se thik us vakt use pakadaa gaya jab wo aatmahatya karne ja rahaa tha
 Ravinder Jadeja may have done well in the current ODI series against England, but former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram feels that it is too early to say that India has found the all-rounder they were looking for
 jadeja ne haalanki maujuuda shrunkhlaa main balle or gend donon se acha pradarshan kiya he, jisamen bhartiya team 3-0 se ajey badhat banaae hue he
 Akram feels that Yusuf Pathan is a strong contender for the all-rounder's position
 akram ne kaha, mujhe lagata he ki yusuf ek mahaan khilaadi he
 It is quite surprising that he is not in the Indian team
 lekin jadeja acha pradarshan kar rahaa he, isliye isse nishchit rup se big heater pathan par dabaav badhegaa
 Yusuf is 28 years old, while Jadeja is 22 and choosing between the two is a difficult task

 He was hesitant

 Reached Delhi, went to him

 From September 13 to May 10, you tried to do the work that you gave
 ek kaarykram nahin ho paaya
 He kept looking at me

 But on May 9, so many races had to cancel only one event amidst the sun

 While our District President who was worrying about the rally, Sushil Rai died suddenly

 Still there has been some deficiency

 If this is in mind, then the countrymen will not have the chance to be disappointed
 main zyada tivi or akhbaar nahin dekh paata
 People will evaluate the election differently
 agar deshavaasiyon ne hang parliament banaai hoti
 Had it given a fractured mandate, it could have been said that there was only a reason for anger towards the government or anti-establishment
 lekin bhartiya janata party ko sampurna bahumat dene kaa matlab hota he ki logon ne aashaa or vishwaas kaa matdaan kiya he
 This entire mandate is expected
 aapako yaad hoga jab 2013 main talkatoraa stadium main hamaari rashtriya parishad mili thi, tab maine kaha tha ki yah chunaav aashaa kaa chunaav he
 One thing came out of my mouth that day

 i said whether we walk or not, the country has moved
 aaj jab ham itani badi sankhya main central haul bijepi ke samarpit senaniyon se bharaa padaa he
 The reason for that, the country has moved, whether we walk or not
 ye umang, ye utsaah chalata rahegaa
 The era of responsibility begins

 Brothers and sisters, i am an optimistic person by nature

 Don't know what frustration is
 yahaan ek college main bhaashan hua tha to ek baat kahi thi
 Today again i am saying ye gilaas aadha pani or aadha hawa se bharaa he
 There is a great need to be optimistic for a positive path
 ashaavadi vyakti hi desh main aashaa kaa sanchaar kar sakate hai
 Crisis comes

 In 2001, there was a severe earthquake in Gujarat

 The Center, not the state, has to take steps on the stubble issue

 They do not see the poisonous air in Delhi
 -dilli ke up mukhyamantrimanish sisodiyane kaha, paraali nistaaran ke liye ab tak 63 hajaar mashine punjab or haryana ke kisaanon ko deen
 Will the stubble burn out with this much? While there are 27 lakh farmers in both the states
 agar itani sust raftaar se mashine banti jaaengi to saare kisaanon tak ise pahunchane main centre ko lagenge 50-60 saal

 By doing so, the government could curb private vehicles

 - Construction work is always happening in Delhi NCR

 To stay updated with the latest news of the general election, subscribe to Aaj Tak's election special newsletter jairam ramesh to kehete hai ki jab tak vasundhara kaa istipha nahin hoga aise dastauez nikalate rahenge
 For this, the Congress brought out the documents of 1949 from National Accident to show that Dholpur House is the property of the government
 congress ne aaj 2010 kaa rajasthan sarkaar kaa ek dastauez dikhaa kar bataaya ki dhaulpur house kii zamin kii maalik sarkaar he
 But when it was acquired by the National Highway Authority in 2010, it was compensated by Dushyant Singh
 wo bhi do karod
 Jairam Ramesh says that on 10 April 2013, two people had complained to the CBI that Dushyant Singh was not the owner, so how did he get compensation
 jairam ramesh ne bataaya ki yah apane aap main ek frad he jisaki sibiai report kaa aaj bhi intazaar he
 Apart from this, the order of additional district judge of Bharatpur was also shown on 17 May 2007, on the basis of which he claims that the court told Dushyant that he can take away the immovable property kept in Dholpur palace
 in sab daleelon se party sabit karti rahi ki dhaulpur pales dushyant singh kii nijee sampatti nahin he
 The BJP says that the 1949 document is correct, but in 1959, Dushyant Singh took the Dholpur Palace by giving the Saffron Bagh Palace
 bijepi ne bhi gada baari press conference kiya lekin congress kii tarah koi bhi dastauez patrakaron ko nahin pakadaaye magar apane paksh main dastavezon ko dikhaaya zarur
 The comments bijepi kaa kahana he ki 2010 main dushyant singh ko do karod kaa muawza mila tab to dilli or jaipur donon jagah congress kii sarkaar thi
 Why did the Congress not investigate when two people complained to the CBI on 10 April 2013? bijepi kahati he ki 17 may 2007 ke aadesh se dushyant singh ke paksh main chal achal sampatti ai he
 Our co-worker Harsha Kumari Singh has also said that upon reading this order in full, it seems that Dushyant Singh has got the Dholpur Palace
 bijepi ne usee aadesh kaa anexchar 9 padhakar sunaaya jisamen likhaa he ki vaaris ko dhaulpur city pales par haq banataa he
 The 2009 Gazette notification states that Dholpur Palace is a private property
 1980 main dhaulpur court main hemanth singh ne bayaan diya tha ki gholpur pales unhen puure jeevankaal ke liye mila he lekin kesarbagh ke badale ise unhen parivaar ko de diya gaya
 So is the Congress leaking parts of the documents that suit him or is the BJP leaking those parts
 lekin jab 2010 main iskaa neshnal haive atharity ne adhigrahan kiya to iskaa muawza dushyant singh ne liya
 That too two crores
 jairam ramesh kaa kahana he ki 10 april 2013 ko do logon ne sibiai se shikaayat kii thi ki dushyant singh maalik nahin hai to muawza kaise le liya
 Jairam Ramesh told that this is a fraud in itself, whose CBI report is still awaited
 iske alaava 17 may 2007 kaa bharatpur ke atirikt zila jaj kaa aadesh bhi dikhaaya gaya jiske aadhaar par unka daawa he ki court ne dushyant ko kaha ki ve dhaulpur mahal main rakhi achal sampatti ko le ja sakate hai
 With all these arguments, the party continues to prove that Dholpur Palace is not the personal property of Dushyant Singh
 bijepi kahati he ki 1949 kaa dastauez sahi he lekin 1959 main kesar baag pales dekar dushyant singh ne dhaulpur pales le liya tha
 BJP also held a huge press conference, but like Congress, no documents should be held by journalists but they showed documents in their favor
 tippaniyan BJP says that in 2010, Dushyant Singh got compensation of two crores, then there was Congress government in both Delhi and Jaipur
 jab 10 april 2013 ko do logon ne sibiai se shikaayat kii tab congress ne jaanch kyon nahin kii
 The BJP says that with the order of 17 May 2007, movable real estate has come in favor of Dushyant Singh
 hamaari sahyohi harsha kumari singh ne bhi kaha he ki is aadesh ko puraa padhane par yahi lagata he ki dhaulpur pales dushyant singh ko mila hua he
 BJP read the Annexure 9 of the same order in which it is written that the heir is entitled to the Dholpur City Palace
 2009 kaa gajet notification kahata he ki dhaulpur pales ek nijee sampatti he
 In 1980, Hemant Singh made a statement in the Dholpur court that he had been given the Gholpur Palace for his entire life, but in lieu of Kesarbagh, it was given to the family
 to kya congress dastavezon ke kuch hisson ko li kar rahi he jo use suut kar rahaa he yaa bijepi un hisson ko li kar rahi he use suut kar rahaa he
 The BJP says that the 1949 document is correct, but in 1959, Dushyant Singh took the Dholpur Palace by giving the Saffron Bagh Palace
 bijepi ne bhi gada baari press conference kiya lekin congress kii tarah koi bhi dastauez patrakaron ko nahin pakadaaye magar apane paksh main dastavezon ko dikhaaya zarur
