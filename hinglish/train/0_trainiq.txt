 When rulers started promoting technical education in this country instead of linguistics, it also had a major impact on our education system
 chaatro ko bataaya gaya ki ganit, angreji or vigyaan padho
 Will get employment and bread too
 phir kya tha har koi apane bachche ko ejeeniyar or doctor banane laga
 Liberalization led to courses such as MBA and CA
 inaki taiyaari ke liye tamaam santhaan khulne lage
 People started being ambassadors of brand India across the seven seas after taking the course and a salary package of lakhs was in their pocket

 Despite all the troubles, Sanskrit is read and when the Governor of a State questions his studies and Sanskrit at the convocation, the students do not delay in throwing slippers at the Governor
 ve jaanate hai ki chand barason baad sanskrit or urdu kii saansen tham jaaengi
 But every year lakhs of youth in these states spend their heads in subjects like Sanskrit and social science at the high school and intermediate level
 hindi madhyam main padhate hai or sapane sanjote hai
 The biggest dream is to become an IAS, becoming a doctor and engineer is a priority, but the status of IAS attracts them a lot

 In all states including UP, Bihar, there are lakhs of boys studying in the center board as compared to non-english board and school students who have to pay fines for speaking Hindi or their dialect in their schools
 angreji madhyam ke tamaam skulon main ladakon ko hindi bolne kii manaahi hoti he
 Speaking is beaten and a fine has to be paid

 Why is it limited around Mukherjee Nagar dilli ke alaava or kahin pradarshan kyon nahin ho rahe hai
 Because by putting emphasis on the market in the best English system, people have been frozen like curd
 desh ke 29 rajyon main angrejon ke bhartiya sanskaran taiyaar ho gaye hai
 Their only aim is to keep the administrative system within their grasp, so they are selectively beating non-english speaking students and people by dragging them to the sibling intersections of '10 Downing Street '

 The question is also why the central government does not liberate CBSE from English
 kyon nahin vah sibiesai ke jariye tamil, bangla, kannada or hindi main shiksha detii he
 No, they want to keep the people of this country linguistically enslaved through English

 There is a question from the political parties of the South whether they do not want to take over the power of Delhi

 maan lijie hindustan ke saare pradesh ek swatantra raashtra hote, to kya angreji hi unki rashtrabhasha yaa rajbhasha hoti he
 Or they would give respect to their languages and they would choose their language from official work to education
 udhaaharan ke liye maan lijie ki agar tamilnadu ek swatantra raashtra hota, to kya ve angreji ko praathamikta dete
 Or Tamil
 agar ve tamil ko praathamikta dete hai, to phir mukhyamantri jayalalita kaa ye kahana ki ‘ham bharat sarkaar se angreji main vaartalap karenge,’ is bayaan ko kis nazariye se dekhen
 Is this not double dealing with Tamil language? ye bhi kaha ja saktaa he ve tamil prem kaa naatak kar rahi hai
 Not only that, but also the boss of DMK
 kya jayalalita ne centre par is baat kaa dabaav banaara ki vah aadhikarik kaaryon ke liye tamil kaa prayog karen
 No, even if they made pressure, they accepted English
 unhen kam se kam angreji main puche jane vaale sawaalon ke jawaab tamil main dene chahie tha
 So that the Central Government is compelled to have a translator and interpreter in every department

 Keep in mind that all these things apply to all regions and languages
 aaj kis vibhaag main ek tamil bolne vaale kii jarurat he? mujhe lagata he kisi bhi aise aadmi kii jarurat nahin he jo tamil jaanata ho
 Yes, English speakers are needed
 angreji jaanane vaale kisi hindustani jabaan main anuwaad karte hai to wo computer kaa sahaara lete hai
 Because Tamil is not known
 rajyon kii jo shiksha vyavastha he usamen angreji main likhi gai kitabon ko padhaayaa jane laga he
 The English which should have been taught as a language, we have started teaching our languages in English
 ham apane hi bacchon ko kabir or raskhaan ke dohe angreji main padhaane lage hai
 Their meanings are beginning to be explained in foreign language, it shows that our children have forgotten their languages
 ve unhen samajhane main asamarth hai
 The most sad thing is that this inability does not inspire us to learn our languages
 kya ham jo shiksha hasil kar rahe hai usamen bhashaa kii pradhanta he, main kahuunga nahin
 There is a language which is not our own, but it dominates our entire education system and our languages
 ham ganit or vigyaan padhane lage hai, gaiyr bhartiya bhashaa main
 And our languages are far behind
 urdu isi desh main maranasann haalat main he
 Because we do not care about languages
 sabko angrejidan hona he
 a language reaches from one place to another with its people, it also has its own culture
 culture kii tulana main bhashaa ko apnaane main thodi mushkil aati he, kyonki use seekhney main time lagata he isliye ham culture ko apnaane lagate hai, phir dhire dhire ham bhashaa ko apana lete hai
 After that, we start feeling bad about everything
 ham apana chhod, gaiyr samskruti or bhashaa ko apana lete hai
 This is the Indian mentality
 hamen dur ke dhol suhaavne lagate hai apni ungaliyon main lipati bansuri ke bajaay
 When the British were going to hand over the power of this country to the Indians, people like Nehru resorted to the English to make their dominance, what was the harm in Hindi or any other language
 hamane sabakuch angrejon kaa apana liya, unki shiksha vyavastha, rahan sahan, saamaajik dhaancha
 We have formed colonies, as we were British colonies
 phir yahi shiksha vyavastha hamaari maasoom bhashaaon kaa galaa ghontati gai
 The result of this system is that children have to be killed and family members are fined for speaking English in their country
 is desh ke ucch nyaayalay main hindi jubaan main bahes karne kii manaahi he
 After all, what kind of country is this? jahaan angreji naa bolne waalon ko achhut samajha jaataa he, unhen hin bhaavana se dekha jaataa he
 The 60-year-old education system has created new British
 isi desh ke vishvavidhyalayon main agar koi baccha jo apane gaanv se padhane aata he to use majaboor kiya jaataa he ki vah pariksha main angreji main prashnon ke jawaab likhe, agar vah apni bhashaa main jawaab he to uske saath marking main doharaa vyavhaar kiya jaataa he or shart main yah bhi ullekh rahata he ki agar aap hindi main jawaab likhenge to aapke number kaate jaaenge
 It will be 2010, my friend wrote the Jawaharlal Nehru University form in Hindi, and could not get admission
 jabaki usne TISS jaise ek nijee santhaan main parchaa hindi main likhaa or use pravesh mil gaya
 You take the paper of any exam and read its conditions, in it you will get a condition in which it will be written that in case of any disturbance, the correct answer will be considered as the answer printed in English
 kyon? kyonki is desh main rahane vaale log kaale angrej ban gaye hai
 They do not know their language
 ve use sahi sahi nahin likh sakate
 i ask you how many students have come from non-english boards at St
 Stephens, one of the best colleges in the country
 zyaadaatar sibiesai yaa phir isiesai ke hote hai, yaa phir sabhi
 They study and then fly to America and Europe
 aise collejon kii kya jarurat he is desh main, lekin aise college chahie kyonki ek varg is desh main paidaa ho gaya jise sabakuch angrejidan chahie
 There is no Indianism left in them
 sisat vivaad to ek baangi bhar he
 If the attitude of the ruling class of this country remained the same, then this country would further disintegrate in the name of language
 kam se kam main to chaahunga hi ki purvanchal ek swatantra desh ho or vahaan ke bacchon ko bhojpuri main shiksha di jaae
 They read literature around the world, but in their own language
 duusari bhashaa seekhen, lekin apni bhashaa kii qurbaani dekar nahin
 i think the students' movement against CSAT is asking for sacrifice and who will give this sacrifice will decide the time

 Graves are sold in UP
 sunne main beshak atapata lage lekin 'aaj tak' kii tafteesh se saamne aayaa he ki upi kii rajdhani lakhanu main adhiktar kabragahon main kabr kii jagah dene ke liye donneton ke naam par hajaaron-lakhon rupye kii rakam lee ja rahi he
 The Shia Central Waqf Board has been receiving complaints for the past several years that graves are also spoken of
 ‘aaj tak’ ko shiya central vakf board ke jariye aise kagajaat haath lage hai jinase pataa chalata he ki kabr bechney-kharidne kaa silsilaa lambey samay se chalaa aa rahaa he
 When someone is taken to a burial place for burial after his or her lifetime, there is a reference to not having a place first
 phir marane vaale ke ghar-parivaar se uski haisiyat ke hisaab se donneton ke naam par rakam vasuul lee jaati he
 These amounts range from thousands to millions
 ek to wo parivaar pehle se hi apane kii maut ke gam se behaal hota he, upar se kabr kii jagah dene ke naam par uski majaburi kaa phayda uthaaya jaataa he
 The Shia Central Waqf Board conducted an investigation on its behalf in 2015 after receiving several complaints of the graves being sold
 phir jaanch adhikari kii report ke aadhaar par thane main taharir bhi di thi
 But despite this much, the process of selling graves continues in most of the graveyards of Lucknow
 shiya central vakf board khul kar aarope laga rahaa he ki kai kabristaanon main kabr kii jagah dene ke badale rakam vasuuli ja rahi he jise donneton kaa naam dekar galat kaam par pardaa daalane kii koshish kii jaati he
 Wasia Rizvi, chairman of the Shia Central Waqf Board, says that it is completely wrong to take donations in the name of Todafanane
 phir donneton ke naam par bhi jamkar farjivada kiya jaataa he
 Donation money is put into the accounts of other organizations and receipts are also given less amount
 wasim rizvi ke mutabik jo log paise kaa itanjam nahin kar pate, unhen lakhanu ke bade kabristaanon main apano ko dafnane ke liye jagah nahin mil paati
 According to the Shia Central Waqf Board, he also has evidence of 'black marketing of graves'
 iske liye wasim rizvi donneton ke vakt di jane vaali kuch raseed kii copy dikhaate hai
 Among them, it is mentioned that the amount of 45 thousand rupees to one lakh should be taken in the name of donation
 shiya setral vakf board kaa kahana he ki uski exiaar par police ne waisi sakriyata nahin dikhaai jaisi ki use dikhaani chahie thi
 If the action had been taken seriously, the sale of graves could have been prohibited
 ‘aaj tak’ ne shiya central vakf board kii jaanch report ko khangala to saamne aayaa ki lakhanu ke ek bade kabristaan gupran maab main dafnane kii evaj main 2005 se 2010 ke bich 59 lakh 82 hajaar 700 rupye vasule gaye
 Many people have sent complaints to the Shia Central Waqf Board with the receipt of donation
 jaise ki 2010 main gajla jaafaree kii kabr ke liye 45 hajaar rupe or nelofar jaafaree kii kabr ke liye 50 hajaar rupye kii rakam bataur donneton lee gai
 Similarly, in 2009, 30 thousand rupees were collected for Zahira Baig's tomb
 ek shaks jine raja ke mutabik unki chachee ke intkaal par kabristaan ke manager ne sava lakh rupye lekar kabr ke liye jameen di thi
 Jane Raza says that her family had to arrange this amount with great difficulty
 talkatoraa kabristaan ke mutavalli faiji ke mutabik kuch saal pehle tak is bade kabristaan main bhi paise lekar kabr di jaati the
 He says that even today, all this is going on in many cemeteries
 gupran maab lakhanu ke badekabristnonmen se ek he
 The caretaker of this cemetery, Izhar Hussain, refuses to buy and sell graves
 unka kahana he ki kuch log apni marji se jarur donneton dete hai, jisaki baqayada raseed di jaati he
 Anyone can get them investigated

 bataa den ki karnataka main sarkaar kii khinchataan ke bich tab congress ke 14, jedies ke 3 vidhayakon ne istipha de diya tha
 After this, the then assembly speaker Ramesh Kumar disqualified all 17 mlas

 After the results of the by-elections on 15 seats, the total seats will be 222
 iske baad 2 vidhansabha siton par chunaav baad main hone he

 Significantly, the BJP accused and his associates, the main accused in this gang rape incident, have been accused of gang rape two years ago
 police maamle kii jaanch kar rahi he
 Shocking Pakistan, a UK court directed him to pay £ 1,50,000 (about Rs 140 million) to India as compensation for legal expenses in the 67-year-old Hyderabad Funds case involving Nizam's assets
 And at the same time justified his behavior as 'inappropriate'

 It is believed that the legal expenses of the Government of India, the National Westminster Bank and the Nizam's successors, Mukarram Jah and Muftkham Jah, amount to around £ 400,000
 inamen se bharat ko 1,50,000 pound, neshnal westminster bank ko 1,32,000 pound or nizaam ke uttaradhikariyon ko 60,000-60,000 pound de die gaye hai
 There can be no change in the waiver of immunity under the judgment, which has opened the way for India to get the funds seized through the legal process
 yah bhi samajha jaataa he ki bharat sarkaar or nizaam ke uttaradhikari vishay par vichaar vimarsh kar rahe hai
 This case, known as the 'hyderabad Funds Case', relates to the transfer of £ 1,007,940 and nine shillings to a London bank account in the name of the newly formed Pakistan High Commissioner to Pakistan in 1948, Habib Ibrahim Rahimtullah
 yah bank khaataa westminster bank (ab netwest bank) kaa he
 The money was transferred by an agent

 Hyderabad became part of India on 18 September 1948
 20 sitambar, 1948 ko yah dhan rahimatulla ko hastanrit kiya gaya tha
 On 27 September 1948, the Nizam demanded the cancellation of the transfer claiming his transfer without his approval

 vanjaaraa par gujarat main aane par pabandi hatane ke baad wo shuukravaar ko phir gujarat aae to samarthakon ne unhen deshbhakt bataa diya
 Supporters welcomed the officer DG Vanzara as the hero of the fake encounter in Gujarat
 pulicekarmiyon ne salaami di to kuch varisht police adhikari or sahaaaropee stage par aakar swaagat karte dikhe
 Vanzara had been in jail since 2007, then got bail in 2015, but conditioned that he would not come to Gujarat
 kuch din pehle wo shart bhi hati to 8 farji encounter ke aaropee deshbhakt hone kaa dam bharte dikhe
 Said that he will now play the second innings and now the anti-nationals will run away from him
 tippaniyan His supporters came to the airport with the tricolor flag and the bandage
 mahatvapurn he ki kuch samay pehle vanjaaraa gujarat kii bhaajapa sarkaar se naaraaz the or dhamkee bhari chitthiyaan bhi likh chuke hai
 He had expressed displeasure with BJP national president Amit Shah and also from some senior police officers
 lekin ab kah rahe hai ki wo puraani baat ho gai he
 He himself is now seen preparing to enter politics
 haalanki vanjaaraa abhi kisi bhi farji encounter maamle main bari nahin hue hai, lekin ab unhen jaays tehraate hue rajya main raajnneeti phir se garmane kaa andeshaa he
 Especially Ishrat Jahan case can get a lot of attention
 david hedli apane bayaan main ye kah chukaa he ki usne suna tha ki ishrat jahaan, lashkar-e-taiyaba kii mahila aatanki thi
 Significantly, this encounter was found to be fake in the investigation and several other policemen including Vanzara are accused in it
 samarthakon ne gujarat main farji encounter kaa cheharaa bane adhikari di ji vanjaaraa kaa hero sa swaagat kiya
 When the policemen gave the salute, some senior police officers and co-accused appeared on the stage and were welcoming
 vanjaaraa 2007 se jail main the, phir 2015 main jamaanat mili lekin shartiya ki gujarat nahin aaenge
 a few days ago, that condition also happened, if the accused of 8 fake encounters were seen to be patriotic
 kaha ki wo ab duusari pari khelenge or ab deshvirohi unase bhaagenge
 The comments airport par unke samarthak tirangaa jhanda or bandbaje ke saath aaye the
 It is important that Vanzara was angry with the BJP government of Gujarat some time ago and has also written threatening letters
 unhone bhaajapa ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah se naaraazgi jataai thi or kuch varisht police adhikariyon se bhi
 But now they are saying that it has become an old thing
 wo ab khud raajnneeti main utarane kii taiyaari karte dikh rahe hai
 Although Vanzara is not yet acquitted in any fake encounter case, but now justifying him, there is a possibility of rekindling politics in the state
 khaas kar ishrat jahaan maamle ko tool mil sakatas he
 David Headley has stated in his statement that he had heard that Ishrat Jahan was a woman terrorist of lashkar-e-taiba
 mahatvapurn he ki ye ancounter jaanch main farji paaya gaya tha or vanjaaraa samet kai anya pulicekarmi isamen aaropee hai
 His supporters came to the airport with the tricolor flag and the bandage
 mahatvapurn he ki kuch samay pehle vanjaaraa gujarat kii bhaajapa sarkaar se naaraaz the or dhamkee bhari chitthiyaan bhi likh chuke hai

 The horrific incident with a girl was carried out in Rohtak district of Haryana
 naa sirf ladki kaa berahami se katl kiya gaya balki gangrape ke baad nirbhaya kii tarah uske sharir ko bhi kshat vikshat kar diya gaya
 The poor people broke all the bones of his head to erase his identity
 jab maamla khulaa to har koi hairaan rah gaya
 This incident, which reminds Nirbhaya, is on 9 May
 20 varshiyayuvatikam se waapas ghar laut rahi thi
 a road was parked waiting for a rickshaw
 tabhi ek car uske paas aakar rukii
 Some youths descended from the car and they forcibly inserted the girl into the car and escaped from there
 ladki ko agava kar liya gaya tha
 The boys in turn raped the young woman in a moving car
 ladki madad ke liye chillaati rahi
 They were begging for mercy from those poor ones
 lekin un havas ke shaitanon ko us par koi taras nahin aayaa
 The car continued to run on the road and they were cracking the young woman's body
 iske baad ve ek sunsaan jagah pahunche
 That place was Pashravarnath Colony behind Rohtak IMT
 jahaan un jaalimon ne us yuvati ko kaid kar liya
 For three days, the boys with the young woman, who would listen to him, would become ashamed of humanity
 ve darinde 9 may se 11 may tak us ladki par julm dhaate rahe
 He was raped several times
 ladki darindon se haar gai or 11 may ko uski laash police ko baraamad hui
 Police was finding it difficult to identify the girl
 kyonki un haivaanon ne ladki ke chehre ko eent pattharon se buree tarah kuchal daalaa tha
 All the bones of his head had been shattered in such a bad way
 uske jism par tej dhar hathiyaar ke nishaan the
 Jism was full of deep injuries
 uske privet parts ko kshat-vikshat kar diya gaya tha
 Seeing such humanity, Satan too should be shy
 pulicebhi hairaan pareshaan thi
 The condition of the corpse was testifying by screaming at the victim of every oppression
 beti teen se gaayab thi
 So her parents living in Sonipat district had reported the daughter's disappearance to the police
 usee shikaayat ke aadhaar par police yuvati ke mata-pita ko laash kii shinaakht ke liye rohtak bulaayaa
 Seeing the condition of the dead body, his family was in a bad condition
 unhone kabhi sapane main bhi nahin sochaa tha ki unki beti ke saath is tarah kaa maamla pesh aayega
 The police proceeded with the investigation with information from parents
 isi dauraan police ne shaq ke aadhaar par sumit naamak ek yuvak ko hiraasat main lekar poochtacha kii, jo yuvati ko pehle se jaanata tha
 During the interrogation, the police began to suspect his nervousness and gestures
 police ne sakhti se poochtacha kii to aaropee kii sari chaalaaki dhari rah gai
 The truth that came out was surprising
 darasal, sumit us yuvati ko pasand karata tha
 He wanted to marry her
 lekin yuvati ne use shaadi ke liye inkaar kar diya
 This is the thing that struck Sumit
 vah yuvati se badla lene kii sajeesh rachane laga
 Under the same plot, he along with his friends kidnapped the first woman and gang-raped her
 teen din tak uske saath haivaaniyat kaa khel khelaa
 Then slaughtered him mercilessly
 uski pahchaan chhipaane ke liye gangrape ke baad eent or pattharon se ladki kaa sir berahami se kuchlaa diya
 In Hajat, Sumit's tongue opened when the police equalized
 barbarta or insaaniyat ko sharmasaar karne kaa ye maamla saamne aayaa
 Hearing which shocked everyone's heart
 aaropee kaa daawa he ki ladki uski garlfriend thi
 Sumit not only murdered his girlfriend, but also gang-raped her several times before associating with her
 us par bepanaah julm dhaaya
 Till then it pained him
 jab tak ki uski jaan nahin nikal gai

 Terrorist scams continue in Kashmir over terror funding
 is bich mangalvaar ko rashtriya jaanch agency (NIA) ne 2 kukhyat patharbaajon ko giraftaar kiya he
 On the other hand, the NIA has prepared a list of more than 100 stones
 mangalvaar ko giraftaar kiye gaye patharbaajon main kulgaam kaa javed or pulavama kaa kamran shaamil he
 Kamram is around 22 years old and also works as a freelance photographer

 Explain that earlier, the army had prepared a list of more than two hundred and fifty terrorists present in the valley
 jiske aadhaar par unhen dher kiya ja rahaa he
 In such a situation, this list of stone-pelters and action on the basis of it is being considered as an important step towards establishing peace in the valley
 kashmir ghati main pakistan ke paise se aatank failaane kii sajeesh par rashtriya jaanch agency NIA ne badi karrwai kii he

 At the end of 2016, inflation was under control and the pain was borne out despite the increased tax

 Inflation will come on the wounds of loss of employment and earnings and that too just before the election
 madhya varg kaa mizaaj shaayad yahi bataa rahaa he
 Savings In the last four years, the consumption of the middle class became based on their savings due to not increasing the earnings
 yaa to unhone pehle se jamaa bachat ko upbhog par kharch kiya, yaa phir bachat ke liye paisa hi nahin bachaa
 As a result, the savings rate of the common people in India is at a minimum level of twenty years in proportion to GDP
 madhya varg ke liye yah doosraa dushchakr he
 Increasing inflation means not saving money for saving — and reducing returns on savings
 logon kii bachat kam hone kaa matlab he sarkaar ke paas nivesh ke sansadhano kii kami yani ki sarkaar kaa karj badhegaa matlab or zyada mahangaai badhegi
 This is the first time in the last two decades that the consumption and savings of the middle class in India have fallen badly together

 Aristotle had told us that the best constitution (government) in the world is the one controlled by the middle class
 inke bina sarkarein yaa to loklubhaavan ho jaaengi yaa phir mutthi bhar amiron kii gulam
 The larger the middle class in a country, the more balanced the governments will be

 It is said that as long as the house is in the house, then everything is fine, but the matter worsens when the battle of mian-biwi comes out of the boundary wall
 upi kii mahila vidhayak ke saath kuch aisa hi hua
 What did her husband suspect, they raided the wife's house in the dark of the night
 upi ke chandausi kii vidhayak lakshmi gautam ke ghar raat ke andhere main chhapemari hui, lekin ye chhapemari naa to police ne kii he or naa hi kisi sarkari mahakme ne, balki yahaan to vidhayak ke ghar main dabish di he, khud unke patidev ne
 And after the raid, the extent was reached when the MLA accused his wife of having illicit relations in public
 darasal, upi ke bhimnagar jile kii vidhayak lakshmi gautam or unke shikshak pati dilip varshney ke bich ye raar tab shuru hua, jab pati ne satta kii chaabi apane haath rakhane ke iraade se anusuchit jati se aane vaali apni house wif bivi ko hi vidhaan sabha chunaav kaa tikat dilaa diya
 The Samajwadi Party wave was going on in the state and in this wave Laxmi Gautam's fleet also crossed
 ab tak chulhaa chaukaa sambhaal rahi lakshmi ghar se nikal kar ja pahunchi, sidhe satta ke un galiyaaron main, jahaan tak pahunchnaa kai achche-acchon ke liye taumr khwab hi rah jaataa he
 But once the steps of Grihalakshmi fell out of the house, she went away step by step from her own husband and gradually the condition was that Lakshmi left her husband's house in Chandausi and moved to Moradabad, about 45 km away, but Husband then became a husband
 itani aasaani se peechha kahaan chhodanevaale the
 So, as soon as the opportunity comes, you come straight to your wife's house to calculate your respect and self-respect
 lekin yahaan takadir ne unke liye kuch or saprise package kaa intjaam kar rakhaa tha
 Sensing her husband's intentions, Biwi entered inside the house and closed the door
 ab baat jaise purusharth ko lalkaarane vaali ho gai
 Patidev may have done something, but his wayward gunman with his wife blocked him
 or tab bivi kii beijjati ne in patidev ko kuch aise jhagazora ki andar hi andar sulag rahaa apmaan kaa lava, ankhon se aansuon kii shakl main baahar nikal aayaa
 But the climax of this story remains
 aakhir kya hoga tab, jab police or khud vidhayak mahodaya apana munh kholengi
 When the matter progressed, then it went on increasing, first the relationship was talked about, then the dignity and then the dignity of the post
 had to tab ho gai jab miyaan ne bhrashtachar ko lekar apni hi vidhayak bivi kaa kaccha chittha kholana shuru kar diya
 But there was a new twist in the story when the wife opened her mouth
 shaam se shuru ho kar der raat tak chale is drame main abhi kaaphi kuch baaki tha
 These men, who have mastered the school, were told that their MLA wife is having fun with her lover in their house
 ye bhala unase kaise bardaasht hota so, is baar chhapemari ke liye wo akele nahin balki rishtedaaron ke saath pahunche the
 But what good does the legislator's gunman get from relatives with whom the relationship had already become a neem ballot
 bas, isiilie master sahab ke bade bhai ne jaise hi mauka dekh kar ghar ke andar ghusane kii koshish kii, vidhayak mahodaya ke ganman ne jeth ji ke gardan par haath rakh kar unhen aisa dhakka diya ki bujurg jeth ji bhabhi ji kii dahalij se sidhe khule maidan main ja pahunche
 Now his condition was like a fly extracted from milk
 lekin is dhakke ne jaise aag main ghi kaa kaam kiya
 It started with the arrival of a husband and wife, but when the wife did not consider the elder brother, then how much would the husband do to the wife? So, this time he attacked his MLA wife most strongly
 bataane lage ki kis tarah apane nazaij rishton se pehle to usne vidhayak pad kii garima mitti main mila di or phir vidhayak banane ke baad bas donon haathon se paisa luutane lagi
 When the talk of corruption ended, Patidev again started remembering his wife's personalities
 is baar bataaya ki kis tarah unki bivi ne kab-kab or kahaan-kahaan apane bwoyfrand ke saath gulchharre udaae
 But now perhaps the MLA had realized the result of this unofficial press conference of Patidev running outside the house
 lihaaja, pehle to unhone maamla taalane kii koshish kii or phir aaraam se baith kar baat karne kii
 Now the only way to escape in the situation that had been created, was the counterattack
 lihaaja, kehane lagi ki patidev shaq karte hai or unhen to dar he ki kahin wo unki jaan hi naa le len
 But the role of the police was still left in this story
 jab ilaake ke daroga sahab ko khabar mili ki vidhayak ke ghar par patidev kaa chapa pad gaya, to halaat kii najaakat ko bhaanp kar janaab fouran mauka-e-vaardaat par pahunche
 But here the media was already engaged in the coverage of the raid and when the officer saw all this, he realized his goodness in tightening the border from here
 lekin media bhala kahaan maananevaali thi, so unhone daroga sahab se sawaal jawaab shuru kar diya or achaanak hui sawaalon kii is bauchhaar ke bich jab daroga sahab ko kuch nahin soojha, to unhone ye kah kar peechha chhudaane kii koshish kii, ki wo to bas gasht par pahunche the
 Now the matter had gone out of the wall of the house, so the local Netaji of the Samajwadi Party also opened a front against his own MLA
 baharhaal, patidev kii chhapemari kaa asar donon ke rishton par kya hoga, ye to abhi nahin pataa, lekin abhi itnaa jarur kah sakate hai ki jab pati-patni ke rishton main aisi pench fansati he, to jagahansai jarur hoti he
 There is not as much talk about the subject of the film 'rang Rasiya' as it is about the boldness of this film

 Along with this, a video of the film came out, in which Nandana Sen's carved body was shown well

 It is special that Nandana has not even used a body double to give a perfect feel to this scene

 Earlier, on 14 December, the Supreme Court dismissed the pils filed for alleged irregularities in purchasing 36 Rafale fighter jets from France
 punarvichaar yachika main unhone aarope lagaaya he ki court ne use silband lipaphe main sarkaar dwaara saunpe gaye bina hastakshar ke ek note main kiye gaye 'saraasar galat' daavon par bharosa kiya

 gauratlab he ki isse pehle bhi congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi apni har sabha main daawa kar chuke hai ki narendra modi chunaav haar rahe hai
 This time the BJP is sure to lose the election
 congress kii ore se daawa kiya ja rahaa he ki congress kii aguwai main vipaksh is baar sarkaar banayega
 On the one hand, the Congress is rejecting the claim of victory, while the BJP is also not behind in making claims
 piem modi, bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne apni har sabha main daawa kiya he ki is baar desh main sarkaar ke paksh vaali lahar chal rahi he or bijepi pehle se bhi adhik siten jeet rahi hai

 aam chunaav kii tazaa khabaron se apadet rahane ke liesbscribakaren ajtak kaa ellection special news letters Rahul Gandhi's strategist Prashant Kishor is planning for UP Fatah, Congress leaders are calling it a reality
 lekin pareshaani kaa sabab ye he ki prashanth kishor urf pike ko rahul kaa varadahast praapt he
 For this reason, leaders who were not aware of it initially, are now forced to remain silent
 congress upaadhyaksh rahul kii ranneeti pike sambhaal rahe hai to raahal bhi unako 100 fisadi back kar rahe hai
 In such a situation, it is bound to be angry with the Congressmen who are looking at the flaws in pk's plan
 lekin pike ko rahul ke samarthan ke kaaran dal kaa koi netaa chaahakar bhi media ke saamne apni naaraazgi nahin jataa paa rahaa
 However, the 'PK Dard' of Congressmen spills over in mutual meetings
 sthaneey baton se bekhbar, netaaon se nahin lee jaati rysutron ke mutabik,prashanth kishoracongress ke liye upi kaa plan bana rahe hai, lekin sawaal uth rahe hai ki planning main sthaneey or pradesh ke netaaon kii raay kyon nahin lee jaati
 For example, PK gives the UP plan on August 18
 us par 21 agast se amal karne kii bhi baat karte hai
 The new team of the UP Congress says that after the announcement of such a big program, it needs at least 5 days to get it on the ground, but the new team was forced to accept only 21
 sthaneey netaaon ko pike ke plan main khamiyaan to najar aa rahi hai
 He wants to complain to the high command of the Congress party, but no one is willing to tie the bell in the cat's neck
 pike raay den, sanghathan main dakhal naa denupicongress kii nai timis baat ko lekar behad pareshaan hai ki unke saare vaade, daawey or bhavishya kii yojanaayen pike tay karte hai
 Party leaders say, 'we finally get the message
 ' sthaneey netaaon kii shikaayat he ki team pike ko kam se kam yatra ke root ke bare main jaankaree honi chahie
 For example, he says that the journey from Lucknow ends in Bahraich
 yatra vaapasi ke vakt nayaa root lekar kuch jilon ko saath joda ja saktaa he, lekin yatra nikalati he, aage badhati he, lakhanu aane ke bajaay netaaon kii mandali duusare root se nikalati he, jahaan vaapasi main koi kaarykram nahin hota
 Not liking pk's program: The pain of Congressmen is that Rahul's political strategists PK decide themselves, while in UP, the new team of UP Congress to take care of small political things in the big UP with 80 Lok Sabha seats and 403 assembly and Cardamom ignores satraps
 prashanth kishor ke plan ko congress ke netaa hakeekat se dur bataa rahe hai

 Went to do nadi kinare vah kapadaa dhone lageen

 AAP sarkaar kaa dillivaasiyon ko tohfa: CM kejariwal bole- ab vaid hongi kachi bastiyaan, malikana haq kaa sapana hoga pooraavahin is maamle main dm kaa kahana he, 'graminon ke dwaara or rina kii 7 saal kii bacchee ne jo bataaya uske mutabik rina devi kaa apane pati ke saath vivaad hua tha
 After which Reena threw the children into the water
 gaanv waalon ne jab dekha to unhone bacchon or rina devi ko pani se baahar nikaala
 No compensation has been announced in this case as it is a case of crime
 iskaa baadh se koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 This can be considered an attempt to murder

 In an episode in Netflix's web series Sacred Games, many serious allegations were made against former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi
 ab in aaropon kaa jawaab unke bete or congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne ek twit ke jariye diya he
 Rahul Gandhi wrote in his tweet, "BJP or RSS believes that freedom of expression should be legally controlled
 meraa maananaa he ki ye swatantraaa ek moolbhoot loktantric adhikaar he
 My father has died and lived to serve the country
 ek kaalpanik web siries ke kisi kirdaar kaa vichaar ise kabhi nahin badal saktaa
 "BJP / RSS believe the freedom of expression must be policed and controlled
 i believe this freedom is a fundamental democratic right
 My father lived and died in the service of India
 The views of a character on a fictional web series can never change that
 # sacredgames — Rahul Gandhi (@rahulgandhi) July 14, 2018 Let us know that a Congress worker from West Bengal objected to that episode of Sacred Games, in which Rajiv Gandhi has been described as a 'phatu' by Nawazuddin's character
 isko angreji sabatital main aapattijanak shabd se anuvaadit kiya gaya he
 Rajiv Sinha, a 37-year-old Congress worker, complained to the police and demanded registration of an FIR against Nawazuddin Siddiqui and the producers

 It was also demanded that they be removed from this series
 yachika main kaha gaya he ki content main purv pradhanmantri rajeev gandhi ke liye galat shabdon kaa istemaal kiya gaya he
 The person who filed the petition said that it has tried to tarnish Rajiv Gandhi's image
 ek aam saamaanya naagarik hone ke saath-saath indian neshnal congress kaa sadsy hone ke naate mujhe secred games ke in drishyon par aapatti he
 So remove that objectionable scene and separate it from Netflix

 bhashaa se input During this journey, he started India's first weekly newspaper, The Sunday Observer
 iske baad indian post or independent jaise akhabaaron ko sambhala
 Launched the Delhi edition of Pioneer, and after that, edited the Outlook Group's ten magazines for nearly a decade and a half, including Outlook, which overtook India Today, the most popular magazine in Indian news magazines
 ek patrkaar or sampadak ke taur par vinod mehta kaa biodata behad kaamyaab or chamakdaar rahaa
 Not only this, all his newspapers and magazines have created a special identity with their look and content
 is kamyaabi ke peeche kaise-kaise sangharsh or chunautiyon kaa saamana vinod mehta ko karnaa padaa, iskaa silsilewar or behad dilachasp vivaran unhone apni aatmakathaatmak pustak lakhanu bvoy e memoyar main kiya
 Since Vinod has been an editor in many establishments, his book Scandal and Gossip is no less, which is also seen in his second book 'editor Unplugged'
 lakhanu vishvavidhyalay se third class main bie paas or patrakarita main bina kisi prishthbhumi or talim ke bhi vinod agar itane kaamyaab hue to isamen unke us najire kaa ahm yogadan he jisase unhone patrakarita ko ek peshey ke taur par apanaaya or khud ko apane pathakon ke prati patibaddh or uttaradaayi banaae rakhaa
 In this endeavor, his own life became a journey of interesting experiences and now he presented the same ups and downs of his life as Lucknow Boy in a very interesting story
 college kii padhai puri karne ke baad vinod naukari kii talash main england gaye
 He already has a school friend with whom he gets his first job, in a factory where he has to cut iron rods with the help of a machine
 vinod ne khud bataaya he ki britain main aath saal rahane ke dauraan ve isi tarah ke chote mot kaam karte rahe
 Vinod returned to Lucknow after eight years in England
 tab tak naa to kariyar bana or naa hi yah tay ho paaya he ki kya karnaa he
 Vinod Mehta reached Mumbai without any plans
 unhone likhaa he ki 70 ke dashak main bharat main modelling or edwartiging hi aise do kshetra the, jinamein kaaphi sambhaavnaaen thi
 No expertise was needed to go into advertising, so he moved to that field
 lekhan se lagaav bad rahaa tha, isi dauraan unhone minaa kumari kii jeevani likhi
 In 1973, Debonair was started by Sushil Somani, owner of a printing press in Mumbai, within a few months of the closure of the magazine
 vinod ji ko jab isaki jaankaree mili to unhone maalik ko patr likh daalaa ki aap mujhe is patrika kaa sampadak bana dijie to main ise band nahin hone duungaa
 He did not even expect that Somani would entrust him with the responsibility of this magazine
 unhone is patrika ko jamaane main kaaphi mehnat kii, kai sthapit lekhakon ko joda
 In fact, the readers of that era realize that along with printing nude photos of girls in the magazine, some level material was also available to read, then the reason was humor
 is patrika ko kaamyaab banane ke baad unhone 1982 main unhone mumbai ke ek prakaashak kii madad se desh ke pehle saptahik akhbaar ke taur par sande abjarwar ko shuru kiya
 Vinod then reached the Indian Post
 vijaypat singhania ko baad main yah akhbaar band kar dena padaa
 Vinod has given an interesting account of how the business interests of a newspaper-runner seem to be affected by the news
 times samooh ke akhbaar independent ko shuru karne ke ek maheene baad hi unhen yah akhbaar chhodana padaa
 He has also depicted the clash of mentality of two newspaper staffers of the Times Group about his experience with the Independent
 lekin vaai bi chhavan ke khilaaf ek khabar ko chhapane ke baad unhen is akhbaar se asamay vidaa hona padaa
 He then pioneered the Pioneer edition of Delhi
 is akhbaar se bhi unhen mahaj isliye hatana padaa kyonki tabake iske maalik lalit mohan thapar ko lagane laga ki akhbaar kii khabaron se unke dost naaraaz hone lage hai
 After this, his successful journey to Outlook begins
 is patrika ko alag banane kii unki jaddojehad kisi ko bhi prerit kar sakati he
 Whether it was news of match fixing, or news of a confrontation between Vajpayee and Advani, or the matter of publishing the documents related to the Radia tapes, what kind of challenges were encountered in working on all these news, in his book Mentioned
 chaar dashakon ke apane sampadakatv ke anubhav ke aadhaar par vinod mehta likhte hai ki aap jo bhi kaam karen, usamen dakshata hasil kiijie to aapaki jarurat hameshaa bani rahegi
 While Vinod goes into detail about his career in Lucknow Boy, in the second part of his autobiography, Editor Unplugged, he has revealed the fine relationship between journalistic management and corporate
 darasal is dauraan ek nishpaksh aawaaj (haalanki kai log unhen congress ke pakshdhar bhi maanate hai) ke rup main bhi vinod mehta ne apni pukhta jagah banaai
 Their departure is such a loss for journalism and intellectual society, which will not be possible to compensate

 In his message on this occasion, Obama said that this month's holy month is of special importance for the people of the Middle East and North Africa who are courageously fighting for democracy, freedom and for their global rights
 obama ne kaha ki apni niyati tay karne, bhay evam hinsa se mukt jivan jeene or swatantra hokar apane dharm kaa paalan karne kaa mauka talash rahe logon ke saath america lagaataar khadaa he
 He said that in America, Ramadan reminds that Islam is part of the nation
 saarvajanik seva se lekar vyapaar tak, swasthya evam vigyaan se lekar kala tak, america muslim desh ko majboot banane main madad kar rahe hai or iske logon ke jivan ko samrudh kar rahe hai
 Obama said that Ramadan holds special meaning for one and a half billion Muslims of the world
 jayalalita kii jeevani 'ammaa jarney fram movie star tu political queen' main lekhika vaasanti ne ek ghatana kaa vistaar se zikr karte is ore ishaara kiya he ki aakhir koun si ek ghatana jayalalita ke liye raajnneetik utthan kaa sabab bani or iske chalate vah ek majboot netaa banakar ubharin or tamilnadu main 'ammaa' ke naam se mashhoor huin
 According to this statement, when Chief Minister m Karunanidhi started presenting the budget of Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly on 25 August 1989, then the Leader of Opposition Jayalalithaa complained in the House that the police are taking action against them at the behest of the ruling party 
 unke phone ko tap kiya ja rahaa he
 Members of Congress supported him and demanded a debate
 spikar ne bajet pesh kiye jane kaa hawala dete hue kaha ki iske chalate bahes kii anumati nahin di ja sakati
 With this, the members of Jayalalithaa's party, the AIADMK, started a commotion in the House and reached the well
 iske ek sadsy ne karunanidhi ko dhakka dene kii koshish kii, jisase unka santulan bighad gaya or unka chashma jameen par girakar tut gaya
 a member of the AIADMK tore the budget pages
 badhate hangaame ke bich spikar ne sadan ko sthagit kar diya
 Jayalalithaa also started leaving the house when a member of the ruling DMK tried to stop her
 usne unki sari is tarah se khinchi ki unka pallu gir gaya
 Jayalalithaa also fell to the ground
 tippaniyan Amidst this development, one of the members of the AIADMK caught up to help Jayalalithaa
 diemke sadsy kii kalai par jor se waar kar jayalalita ko unke changul se chhudvaaya
 Hurt by this insult, Jayalalithaa vowed like Panchali that she would now step into that house only when it would be safe for women
 yani ek tarah se unhone apane aap se vaada kiya ki ab wo tamilnadu vidhansabha main mukhyamantri ke rup main hi vaapasi karengi
 Within two years of this, during the election in 1991, he repeatedly mentioned his insults in the campaign
 natijatan upji sahanubhuti kaa unako laabh mila or vah chunaav jitkar pehali baar mukhyamantri baniin or rajya main mahilaon kii suraksha ke lihaaj se kai upaay kiye
 As a result, people started calling him 'amma'
 is vaakye ke mutabik 25 agast 1989 ke din jab mukhyamantri em karunanidhi ne jab tamilnadu vidhansabha kaa bajet pesh karnaa shuru hi kiya tha tabhi vipaksh kii netaa jayalalita ne sadan main shikaayat karte hue kaha ki satta paksh ke ishaare par police unke khilaaf karrwai kar rahi he
 Their phones are being tapped
 congress ke sadasyon ne unka samarthan kiya or bahes kii maang kii
 Speer cited the presentation of the budget and said that it could not allow debate
 isse jayalalita kii party annadramuk ke sadasyon ne sadan main shorsharaba shuru kar diya or wel tak pahunch gaye
 One of its members tried to sabotage Karunanidhi, which upset his balance and his glasses fell to the ground and broke
 annadramuk ke ek sadsy ne bajet ke pannon ko faad diya
 The speaker adjourned the house amid growing uproar
 jayalalita bhi sadan se nikalne lageen tabhi sattadhari diemke ke ek sadsy ne unhen rokane kii koshish kii
 She pulled her sari in such a way that her pallu fell
 jayalalita bhi jameen par gir gayi
 The comments is ghatnakram ke bich annadramuk ke ek sadsy jayalalita kii madad ke liye lapke
 Jayalalitha was freed from the clutches of the DMK member by striking her wrist
 is apmaan se aahat hui jayalalita ne panchali kii tarah pratigya lee ki ab wo us sadan main tabhi phir kadam rakhengi jab wo mahilaon ke liye surakshit ho jayega
 That is, in a way, she promised herself that now she will return as the Chief Minister in the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly
 iske do varshon ke bheetar 1991 main hue chunaav ke dauraan apane apmaan kaa zikr baar-baar abhiyaan main kiya
 As a result, she got the benefit of sympathy and she won the election and became the Chief Minister for the first time and took many measures for the safety of women in the state
 natijatan logon ne unako 'ammaa' kahana shuru kar diya
 With this, the members of Jayalalithaa's party, the AIADMK, started a commotion in the House and reached the well
 iske ek sadsy ne karunanidhi ko dhakka dene kii koshish kii, jisase unka santulan bighad gaya or unka chashma jameen par girakar tut gaya

 'IANS se input In view of the Lok Sabha elections in Madhya Pradesh, Congress has released a list of star campaigners who will go to the voters and seek votes for the Congress
 lekin, is list main netaaon ke saath santon ko bhi shaamil kiya gaya he
 In fact, with the success of the soft Hindutva formula in the 2018 assembly elections, Gadgad Congress is now thinking of adopting the same formula in the Lok Sabha elections as well
 madhyapradesh main congress ne apane star prachaarkon kii suchi main computer baba ko jagah dekar ye saaf kar diya he ki party soft hindutv kii raah par chalate hue hi loksabhaa chunaav main janata se vot maangegi
 When he spoke to Aaj Tak correspondent with Computer Baba, who made it to the list of Congress's star campaigners, he clearly said that the religion of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is a show of religion, which divides people into Hindus and Muslims
 computer baba ne to ye tak kah diya ki congress ke liye to ve prachaar karenge hi or mauka mila to narendra modi ke saamne chunaav ladanaa chaahate hai
 Talking to 'aaj Tak', Computer Baba said that i will go among the people and tell that BJP does the work of dividing into caste and religion
 main bijepi ke jhooth or paakhand se pardaa hataaoongaa
 Computer Baba said that the BJP only talks about religion, but the Congress works for religion honestly
 computer baba ne to bijepi ummidavaaron kii jamaanat tak jabt karwaane tak kaa daawa kiya or kaha ki main jahaan bhi congress ummidavaaron ke liye prachaar karne jaaoongaa, vahaan bijepi ummidavaar kii jamaanat jabt ho jaaegi
 The Congress itself believes that Computer Baba will keep the bjp's lie in front of voters during campaigning because Baba resigned from the post of Minister of State due to bjp's promise of Narmada patronage and Gaumata patronage
 loksabhaa main congress ke madhyapradesh chunaav prabharee suresh pachori kaa kahana he ki bijepi ne maa narmada kii safai, shipra kii safai, vriksharopan or anya dharmik aayojanon ko lekar pradesh kii bholi-bhali janata ko bhramit karne kii koshish kii
 Computer Baba would like to expose this and if he will go among the public to expose it then i do not think there is anything objectionable in it
 congress ke netaa mandir sirf chunaav ke samay nahin balki hameshaa apane dharm kaa paalan karte hai
 Computer Baba, once a star of the bjp's eyes due to its ability to keep the saint community, is now going to promote the Congress
 aise main maamle par bijepi ne kaha he ki computer baba kaa khud kaa koi mahatv nahin bachaa he, isliye unke prachaar karne se bijepi ko koi fark nahin padane vaala he
 BJP spokesperson Rajneesh Aggarwal said that Computer Baba has neither been a worker or a member of the BJP ever
 aise baabaaon kaa saamaajik or dharmik mahatv vaise bhi bachaa nahin he
 They sometimes prophesy, sometimes they do Netagiri
 akhaada parishad ne bhi unhen baahar kar diya he
 Those who do not follow the rules of being their Baba, religion and law, the society will not pay attention to them
 aapako bataa den ki computer baba ko shivaraj sarkaar ne 2018 ke vidhansabha chunaav se pehle rajyamantri kaa darja diya tha, lekin beete saal hue vidhansabha chunaav se thik pehle computer baba ne na keval pad se istipha de diya tha balki bijepi par narmada sangrakshan or gaumata sangrakshan ke maamle main jhooth bolne kaa aarope lagaakar chunaav ke dauraan bijepi kii naak main dam kar diya tha
 Now it is to be seen that the way computer Baba helped the Congress in the assembly elections, will they be able to do it in the Lok Sabha elections as well? Every news of the election will be received directly in your inbox

 The trust claims that in April 2010, it distributed baisakhi, hearing machines and tricycles to 42 people
 list main kam se kam chah naam aise hai, jo trust ke daawey par sawaal uthaate hai
 Our team found that some of these are not known and some have not received any help
 bulandshahr ke barhana gaanv main rahane vaali 17 saal kii priti na thik se bol sakati he, na sun sakati he or na hi chal paati he
 The list of Salman Khurshid's Zakir Hussain Memorial Trust states that he was given a crutches in the camp in April 2010
 bulandshahr prashasan ne bhi maan liya ki priti ko baisakhi mili he, lekin priti or uskaa parivaar ise galat bataate hai
 After this we reached Chitsona, another village in Bulandshahr
 jakir hossain trust kii list ke mutabik chitasona ke pradeep kumaar ko ek tipahiyaa diya gaya he, lekin pradeep kumaar naam kaa koi shaks is gaanv main rahata hi nahin

 nagala ugrasen gaanv ke shishpal ab is duniya main nahin he
 He died last year
 trust kaa daawa he ki unhen baisakhi mili, lekin shishpal ke bete ke mutabik yah daawa saraasar galat he
 The District Handicapped Welfare Officer of Bulandshahar says that everything will be cleared only after a thorough investigation
 trust kaa daawa he ki usne april, 2010 main 42 logon ko baisakhi, sunne kii mashine or tipahiyaa jaisi chijen bantee

 susheel modi ko jawaab dete huetejasvi yadavane bhi twit ke jariye un par nijee hamale kiye
 Tejashwi described Sushil Modi as a rigged and deceitful man, who calls Rajkumar Modi, a cousin born of his mother's womb, his distant relative
 tejasvi ne kaha ki jo vyakti apane sage bhai ko dur kaa rishtedaar bataata he vah insaan kitna bada frod or dogala hoga? tejasvi ne susheel modi or unke bhai rajkumaar modi par bhrashtachar ke aarope lagaae or sawaal poocha ki aakhir susheel modi chote se kapade kii dukaan chalaate-chalaate aaj kharbon ke maalik kaise ban gaye ?tejasvi ne yah bhi sawaal poocha kisushil modike bhai rajkumaar modi kii real state company, ashiana garden unke upmukhyamantri banane ke baad 1 xxrep 4 0 karod kii kaise ho gai? tejasvi ne aarope lagaaya ki susheel modi kii bahan rekha modi kii sanliptata hajaaron karodon rupee ke srijan ghotaale main bhi he

 Tejashwi once again openly challenged Sushil Modi and asked him to argue with him on the issue of corruption
 gayak sonu nigam ke ajaan ko lekar likhe gaye twits par muslim netaaon kii tarah se tikhi pratikriya saamne ai he
 Samajwadi Party leader and former UP minister Azam Khan has told Sonu Nigam not to live in such areas where such a loud voice is heard in his ears
 udhar, congress netaa shahzad poonawala ne bhi sonu nigam ko unke twits ke liye aade haath liya he
 Shahzad asked if Sonu will make an 'anti Ajan squad' for this? Please tell that Sonu Nigam had tweeted one after the other on Monday morning
 pehle twit main unhone kaha tha- ishwar sabhi par krupa kare
 i am not a Muslim and i had to wake up after listening to Ajan
 bharat main kab ye jabaran dharmikata khatm hongi
 Sonu said in another tweet that - and the moment Mohammed created Islam, there was no electricity
 phir edison ke (avishkaar ke) baad kyon mujhe ye shor bardaasht karnaa pade
 Sonu said in the third tweet, 'I don't think any temple or gurudwara uses electricity to lift people who don't follow that religion
 to phir aisa kyon?' sonu ne chauthe or aakhri twit me kaha- 'gundgardee he bas'
 On these same tweets of Sonu, Azam Khan said, 'they should not live in such areas, where such a loud voice is heard in their ears
 aise ilaakon se dur rahen
 Those who dance and dance should stay in such a place where they can make good efforts
 achche sukun kii jindagi guzaar saken
 There are rich people, live in a place where bhajans, gurbani, ajans are not heard
 naachne gane waalon ke liye vaise bhi aisi jagah suut nahin karte
 They should change the area and should not stay in such a place
 'is bich,maharashtra se taallukarakhane vaale congress netaa shahzad poonawala ne dilli main kaha- 'jahaan tak meraa sawaal he main ajaan se bhi jaagta hum, gayatri mantra se bhi jaagta hum
 Be it Ajan, Janmashtami's Aarti, use of a loudspeaker in Ganesh Chaturthi or the processions that go on the streets every day, these are all things that are happening against the noise pollution law
 agar dishanirdeshon kaa ulanghan ho rahaa he to samaan rup se karrwai honi chahie
 But selectively putting one in the dock and not even mentioning the other is not correct
 'shahzad ne ye sawaal bhi kiya ki kya iske liye sonu nigam 'anti ajaan squad' banaaenge? shahzad ne kaha ki agarkanoon kaa ulanghanho rahaa he to uskaa sabhi se sahi tarah se paalan karaane kaa kaam prashasan kaa he

 With the offer of the resignation of the first woman Chief Minister of Gujarat Anandiben Patel, the discussion started as to who would become the new Chief Minister of the state
 pichley dinon jis tarah anandiben ko mukhyamantri pad se hataae jane kii khabaron ne jor pakadaa tha, tabhi ye tay ho gaya ki anandiben ke netritv main 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav nahin lade jaaenge
 The big question in this situation is, who will be the successor of Anandiben? Some names are being discussed for the claimant of this post in the political corridor
 sutron ke mutabikmukhyamantri banane kii res mensbase upar gujarat bijepi ke adhyaksh vijay rupani kaa naam liya ja rahaa he
 Actually, Vijay Rupani is said to have a good hold in the organization
 anubhav ke saath hi vishwasaneey cheharaa hai rupanianandiben ke gujarat ke mukhyamantri banane ke baad rajya main party kaa sanghathan kamjor ho rahaa tha
 The bjp's internal mobilization was going to the high command
 yahi vajah thi ki sanghathan ko majboot banane ke liye vijay rupani ko adhyaksh banaaya gaya
 However, Vijay Rupani himself is also in the role of Transport Minister in the government
 aise main sarkaar chalaane kaa anubhav bhi unke paas kareeb ek saal kaa he
 Rupanivijay Rupani, who is also close to Shah, is being named above all because he is one of Amit Shah's close ones
 saath hi sarkaar or sanghathan kaa samanvay wo bakhubi kar rahe hai
 Even in the last days, all the important schemes of the government were announced by Vijay Rupani in place of Anandiben Patel
 haalanki jaankaar ye bhi maan rahe hai kigaiyr-patidaar samudaay se mukhyamantribanaae jane par bijepi ko gujarat main patidaar voton kaa nuksaan bhi jhelana pad saktaa he
 Nitin Patel, a close confidant of Modi, also has another name coming up as Anandiben's successor in the race
 nitin patel ek to patidaar samudaay se aate hai, saath hi wo lambey vakt se sarkaar main mantri bane hue hai
 When Narendra Modi was the Chief Minister in Gujarat, Nitin Patel was one of the leaders close to Modi
 haalanki patidaar andolan ke vakt par nitin patel ko apane hi patidaar samaaj ke gusse kaa shikaar hona padaa tha
 Even the Patidars had brought Nitin Patel into the community on the edge
 aise main sawaal yah bhi he ki kya nitin patel bijepi kii ummiido par khara utrenge
 The name of Bhikhu Dalsania is also the chair of the third party
 bhikhu dalsania pichley lambey vakt sebijapi ke sanghathanamen kaam kar rahe hai
 When Narendra Modi was the Chief Minister in Gujarat, Bhikhu had a very good hold in the organization
 wo aresas ke bhi kaaphi kareebi rahe he
 Clean image and casteist equations are also seen in favor of Bhikhu
 purushottam rupala or saurabh patel ke naam par phul stop!purushottam rupala or saurabh patel ke naam par purnaviram lagata dikh rahaa he
 Rupala has recently been made a member of the Rajya Sabha and has also been given a ministerial position at the center
 vaise main wo istipha den or gujarat ke mukhyamantri bane, yah baat har kisi ke gale nahin utar rahi he
 On the other hand, being the son-in-law of the Ambani family, there is no hope of Saurabh Patel becoming the Chief Minister
 agar saurabh patel ko siem banaaya jaataa he to 2017 main pehali baar gujarat main vidhansabha chunaav ladane kaa plan bana rahi aam aadmi party ko baithe bithaae ek mudda mil jayega
 Which can also become a loss deal for BJP in the assembly elections
 kapil mishra ke aaropon se uthe siyaasi tufaan ke bich ravivaar ko aam aadmi party kii rajya stareey baithak hone ja rahi he
 This meeting will continue till 8 pm in Punjabi Bagh, Delhi
 meeting main party ke navnirvaachit mandal adhyakshon ke alaava party ke aalaa netaa shariq honge
 These leaders include Arvind Kejriwal and Kumar Vishwas
 kya he meeting kaa agenda?samajha ja rahaa he ki baithak ke dauraan dilli main party ko majboot banane ke tareekon par charchaa hogi
 CM Kejriwal himself will address the meeting
 party se naaraaz chal rahe kumaar vishwaas bhi baithak main shaamil honge
 Apart from Kapil Mishra's allegations, these issues are also expected to be discussed in the meeting: - disturbances in evms - making the functioning of Delhi government accessible to the public - Challenges before the Church Party on the campaign 'my booth, the strongest': The recently concluded assembly elections The Aam Aadmi Party was not able to perform well
 iske baad emsidi chunaav main bhi party ko jhatka laga he
 After this, the party was not able to manage well that the rebellion of Kapil Mishra created a storm within the party
 is sabake bich party kaaryakartaaon ke girte manobal ko uthaanaa aam aadmi party netaaon ke saamne sabase badi chunauti he

 6 sitambar se pitrupaksh shuru ho chukaa he
 This time Pitrupaksha will be 14 days
 kaha jaataa he ki is dauraan hamaare purvaj or pitar dharti par utarate hai or hamen dekhte hai
 Once the ancestors are happy, they give blessings, which is fulfilled by desire
 pitrupaksh kaal ko shubh nahin maanate
 Therefore every auspicious work is prohibited during this time, such as wedding, home shopping or shifting, wedding shopping etc
 thik usee prakaar, jaise ki ghar main kisi parijan kii matyu ke baad ghar main ek khaas avadhi ke liye sabhi mangalik kaary roak die jate hai
 Why are these five creatures chosen? According to religious belief, during this time our ancestors are spiritually connected to us, we should seek blessings from them through worship rituals
 pitrupaksh ke dauraan apni aadaton or shaukon par thodon niyantran kar pitaron ko khush kiya ja saktaa he
 It is believed that during this period, one should feel free from all kinds of auspicious work and feel connected with his fathers
 gaay kii seva se miltaa he pitaron kaa aashirvadakaha jaataa he ki pitrupaksh main pitrugan pitrulok se dharti par aa jate hai
 In these 14 days time period, there is a lack of water on the Pitrilok
 isliye pitrupaksh main pitrugan pitrulok se bhuulok aakaar apane vanshajo se tarpan karwaakar trupt hote hai
 Therefore, when a person is in debt, how can he perform auspiciousness by celebrating happiness
 pitrurin ke kaaran hi pitrupaksh main shubhakarya nahin kiye jate
 Amid the ongoing tussle over the Lokpal bill, Gandhian activist Anna Hazare has slammed the government and accused him of not keeping his promise
 lokapal masauda vidheyak ke do sanskaran cabinet ko bhejne ke sarkaar ke nirnay par ‘aashcharya’ jataate hue gandhivadi anna hazaare ne kaha ki sakht lokapal kanoon banane kii kendra kii koi manshaa nahin he
 He said that if a weak law is made, he will go on hunger strike from August 16
 hazaare ne kaha ki sarkaar ne beete april main lokapal masauda samiti kaa gathan kar vaada kiya tha ki yah samiti ‘aam sahmati’ vaala masauda taiyaar kar cabinet bhejegi or samaaj ke sadasyon ke sujhaavon ko sweekaar kiya jaayegaa
 Now the government has turned back on its promise
 unhone kaha, ‘aashcharya he ki sarkaar cabinet ke paas masaude ke do alag-alag sanskaran bhejne kii baat kah rahi he
 If this was to be done, what was the rationale for the formation of the Lokpal Drafting Committee
 itnaa samay barbaad kyon kiya gaya
 This shows that the government has no intention of preparing an effective legislation
 sarkaar bhrashtachar ko khatm nahin karnaa chaahati
 "when i went on hunger strike in April, the government promised to accept all our suggestions," Hazare alleged at the press conference
 ab sarkaar apane vaadon se mukar rahi he
 If a weak bill is brought, i will fast on Jantar Mantar from August 16
 ’unhone kaha, ‘baba ramdev ke andolan ko jis tarah todane-marodane kii koshish kii gayi, agar vaisaa hi hamaare saath hua to ham iske liye taiyaar hai
 We are ready to arrest, eat sticks and eat bullets
 hamaara andolan ahimsak rahegaa
 Hazare's fellow activist Arvind Kejriwal said, "the government is missing an opportunity to enact a strict bill and take credit for it
" ab sarkaar ‘lokapal’ nahin, balki ‘jokapaal’ vidheyak laana chaahati he
 On whether the members of the society are 'blackmailing' the government, Hazare said, 'if we have to' blackmail 'any thing in the interest of the nation and society, then we also accept this charge
 ’unhone kaha ki agar sarkaar ne jantar mantar par unhen anshan kii ijaajat nahin di to vah giraftaar de denge
 On this, Kejriwal said, 'what can this government doing injustice be blackmailed
 sarkaar hamaare nirvaachit nahin hone kaa mudda uthaa rahi he
 The government should explain what people like Planning Commission Deputy Chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia are elected? ”he said,“ We have full respect for Parliament but Parliament needs to be separated from mps
 sansad kaa sammaan banaaye rakhane kii jimmedaari saansadon kii he
 On the statement of Law Minister Veerappa Moily on the issue of Lokpal on 34 out of 40 issues raised by the society, Kejriwal said, "we told the government 40 points first and 31 points later
 inamen se sirf 15 binduon par hi sahmati ban paayi he
 The remaining points have not been discussed yet
 sarkaar kaa daawa galat he
 He said that discussions on 20 per cent points could not be completed till the meeting of 15 June
 iske baavjood sarkaar ne aisi ghoshnaa kyon kii ki cabinet ke paas masaude ke do sanskaran bheje jaayenge
 We had asked to give audio tapes of the proceedings of the committee so far, but the government also rejected this demand
 kejariwal ne kaha ki pradhanmantri or sansad ke andar saansadon ke aacharan ko lokapal ke daayre main laane par sarkaar taiyaar nahin he
 The government is citing the Judicial Accountability Bill on the issue of higher judiciary
 hamane sarkaar se anurodh kiya tha ki kam se kam nyaayik javabdehi vidheyak ke nyaayadhishon kii jaanch se jude vishyon par hi is samiti main charchaa kara lee jaye
 Regarding the model of Lokpal, Kejriwal said that the government wants that only the 11-member body should be given all the rights
 lekin aisa karne se naukarshahon ke bhrashtachar ke sabhi maamalon kii lokapal jaanch nahin kar paayegaa
 The RTI activist said that the Hazare side would maintain dialogue with political parties after the final meetings of the Lokpal drafting committee to be held on June 20 and 21
 hamane beete april main andolan karne se pehle sabhi pramukh dalon ke netaaon se mulaakaat kii thi
 He said, 'in March we asked for a time to meet Congress President Sonia Gandhi but we were not given time
 iske baad hamane kendriya mantri pranav mukherjee or pi
 Chidambaram as well as BJP leaders like LK Advani, Sushma Swaraj, Arun Jaitley and Brinda Karat and D
 raja jaise vam netaaon se bhi mulaakaat kii thi
 He said that the government does not want a strict Lokpal Bill because by doing so, more than half of its ministers can go to jail in corruption cases
 masauda samiti ke sah-adhyaksh shanti bhushan ne kaha ki nau june ko sansad kii ek sthaayee samiti ne rajyasabha ke sabhapati ko vislabloar ke sangrakshan sambandhi vidheyak par apni report saunpi
 The committee clearly said that the Union Council of Ministers should be brought under the purview of the bill and the investigation should be handled by an independent body
 kendriya mantriparishad main pradhanmantri bhi aate hai
 He said that it is surprising that the Parliamentary Standing Committee says this, while the five ministers of the government are talking about keeping the Prime Minister's office outside the purview of the Lokpal
 prashanth bhushan ne kaha ki hamaare liye ab tak ke ghatnakramon kii ek badi uplabdhi yah rahi ki bhrashtachar se nipatane ke bare main janata ke bich vyapak jaagrukta laayi ja saki
 We have been able to communicate directly with the public on this issue
 maharashtra main 2014 ke mukaable ghat raheen bijepi kii sitenshivsena bargening power main, rakh sakati he apni shartmaharashtra main vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi-shivasena gathbandhan kii satta main vaapasi hona tay he
 In the results of 288 seats in Maharashtra, BJP got 105 seats and Shivesana got 56 seats
 jabaki 2014 ke chunaav main bijepi ko 122 siten mili thi
 In this way, the BJP has lost about 17 seats in the Maharashtra Assembly elections
 is tarah shivasena se milakar ladane ke baad bhi bijepi ko maharashtra main tagada jhatka lag rahaa he
 According to the results of 288 assembly seats in Maharashtra, the BJP won 105 seats and the Shiv Sena 56 seats
 jabaki congress ne 44 or ensipi ne 54 siton par jeet hasil kii he
 In such a situation, even though the bjp-shiv Sena may return to power, the BJP is facing a big setback
 haalanki bijepi 2014 ke chunaav main akele chunavi maidan main utari thi or 122 siton par baaji maari thi
 While Shiv Sena got 62 seats
 chunavi nattejey ke baad shivasena ko bijepi ke saath milakar sarkaar banane ke liye majaboor hona padaa
 Not only this, the Shiv Sena supported the BJP on its terms
 lekin is baar bijepi aisi sthiti main najar nahin aa rahi he
 Let us know that this time BJP is in the fray with Shiv Sena and has contested 164 seats
 jabaki uski sahyogi shivasena 124 siton par maidan main utari thi
 In this way, the BJP has not got any great benefit of going with Shiv Sena and joining congress-ncp rebels
 maharashtra main bijepi-shivasena ne 220 seat paar kaa naaraa diya tha, lekin jis tarah ke abhi tak rujhaan aae hai isse bijepi ko tagada jhatka laga he
 Half a dozen ministers from Maharashtra have lost the election
 gopinath munda kii beti pankaja munde chunaav haar gai hai
 While Pankaja was the strong minister to the Fadnavis government
 is baar shivasena kii najar siem pad par he
 In this election, Uddhav Thackeray's son Aditya Thackeray has contested from the Thackeray family for the first time
 aise main shivasena maukey kii najaakat ko dekhte hue dhai-dhai saal ke siem formule kii shart bhi bijepi ke saamne rakh sakati he
 In such a situation, the strategy of making the BJP a place on its own in the politics of Maharashtra may get a shock

 aisa mana jaataa he ki pitru paksh main hamaare pitar dharti par aakar hamen aashirwad dete hai
 These ancestors come to us through animals and birds and through them take food
 jyotishi kehete hai ki shraadh ke dinon main jeev ke rup main pitru dharti par aate hai or apane vanshajon ko aashirwad dekar krupa karte hai
 Therefore, it is necessary to serve animals and birds on the ancestral side
 aaie jaanate hai shraadh main pashu-pakshiyon kii seva kaa kya mahatv he
 - It is believed that in Pitru Paksha, our ancestors come to earth through animals and birds and bless us
 - jin jeevon or pashu-pakshiyon ke madhyam se pitru aahaar grahan karte hai wo hai- gaay, kutta, kauwa or cheentee
 - At the time of Shraddha, a portion of diet is also taken for them, only then Shraddha Karma is considered complete
 - shraadh karte samay pitaron ko arpit karne vaale bhojan ke paanch ansh nikaale jate hai- gaay, kutta, cheentee, kauwa or devataaon ke liye
 - Offering these five degrees is called Panchabali
 in paanch jeevon kaa hi chunaav kyon kiya gaya haikutta jal tatv kaa pratik he ,cheentee agni tatv kaa, kauwa vaayu tatv kaa, gaay prithvi tatv kaa or devtaa akaash tatv kaa pratik he

 China has expressed happiness over the decision to extend the tenure of Pakistan Army Chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa by 3 years
 pakistan ke pradhanmantri imran khan ke is faisle kaa swaagat karte hue kaha china ne buudhvaar ko kaha ki bajva china sarkaar ke 'puraane dost' hai jinhone dwipaksheeya sambandhon ko majboot karne main ahm bhoomika nibhaai he
 General Bajwa, 58, was appointed as the Chief of Army Staff in November 2016 by former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
 unhen november main ritair hona tha, lekin pradhanmantri imran khan ne 'kshetreey suraksha ke maahaul' ko dekhte hue unka kaarykaal 3 saal ke liye badha diya
 The decision has been taken by the Pakistan PM at a time when relations between India and Pakistan remain tense, and Afghan peace talks between the US and Taliban militants continue
 general bajva ke kaarykaal ke vistaar ke bare main puche jane par, chini videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa geng shuang ne kaha ki pakistan sena pramukh bajva ne china or pakistan ke sambandhon ko majboot karne main ahm yogadan diya he
 He said, 'we have taken note of the decision of the Government of Pakistan
 general bajva pakistani sena ke ek asaadhaaran netaa hai
 He is also an old friend of the Chinese government and the military
 'geng ne ek sawaal ke jawaab main kaha, 'bajva ne china-pakistan sambandhon main yogadan diya he
 We believe that the Pakistani Army under his leadership will continue to contribute to maintaining Pakistan's sovereignty, security interests, regional peace and stability
 'general bajva ne beijing se 60 billian america dollar ke pakistan-china aarthik galiyare (CPEC) ke tahat pakistan main china ke hiton kii raksha karne kaa vaada kiya he
 Explain that this corridor will connect China's largest province of Xinjiang to Pakistan's Gwadar port in Balochistan
 is galiyare main pakistani sena ne pehle hi ek batalian khadi kar di he or CPEC ke tahat chini nagarikon or pratishthanon kii suraksha ke liye ek or batalian banane kii yojana kii ghoshnaa kii he
 China's comment on Khan's decision to extend General Bajwa's term is no surprise, as there has been little public comment on China's appointments of its officials by any other country
 bajva ke vistaar kii pakistan ke vipakshi dalon ne tikhi aalochana kii thi, jisamen kaha gaya tha ki isse galat sandesh jayega ki pakistan kii sena 'ek yaa do vyaktiyon' par hi nirbhar he
 Experts say the Chinese spokesman's remarks about General Bajwa's expansion are aimed at strengthening China's special relationship with Pakistan's military establishment
 general bajva pakistan ke purv senapramukhon kii tarah hi china kaa chakkar lagaate rahe hai
 But he is the only Pakistani army chief who met Chinese President Xi Jinping during a visit to Beijing in September last year

 "nitish does not do 'hawabi' like Modi" Even though Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi does not accept the statement of the rescue of 15,000 people from Uttarakhand, his claim has definitely got the politics hot for the last few days

 Renu said that the Chief Minister (nitish Kumar) believes in the welfare of the people, not in air

 Wednesday's day in the Lok Sabha was very rude due to the dispute over the Rafale Ladaku plane deal with France
 jab kai baar mike band karnaa padaa, siton kii adla badali dekhne ko mili, kaagaj ke jahaaj udaae gaye or hooting va narebaaji hui
 When the debate started on behalf of Congress President Rahul Gandhi, the AIADMK MP started an uproar on the case of Kaveri
 tab rahul gandhi ko spikar se aagrah karnaa padaa ki sadan ko aandar main laayaa jaae
 As soon as the debate started, AIADMK mps started making a ruckus with placards in the hands of the Cauvery case, they also tore the paper
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne aarope lagaaya ki ediemke ke saansad pradhanmantri ko bachaane ke liye hangaamaa kar rahe hai
 Rahul asked the speaker if he can go to another seat and speak? After this, he reached the seat between NK Premachandran and Rajesh Ranjan and made his point
 jab rahul gandhi ne bahes ke dauraan goa ke mantri vishwajit raane kaa kathith audio sunaane kii koshish kii tab paanch minute ke liye mike band kar diya gaya
 After this, during the speech of Rahul, the mic was closed again and the house was adjourned for five minutes
 kamovesh aisi hi stithi tab dikhi jab kendriya vitt mantri arun jetali ne bolnaa shuru kiya or boforce, neshnal herald cese kaa zikr kiya
 After which Congress mps came to Vail and started shouting slogans
 iske baad morcha sambhala congress ke yuva saansadon ne, jyotiraditya sindhiya, sunil jakhad or gurjeet singh aujala ne kaagaj ke jahaaj banaae
 While mps Rajiv Satav, Ranjit Ranjan and Sushmita Dev flew the paper vessels made by them to the House
 is bich ek anya yuva saansad gaurav gogoi ne anya saansadon ke saath narebaaji kii kaman sanbhali
 Speaking to India Today, Congress MP Gaurav Gogoi said, 'we came to Vell and staged a protest because Finance Minister Arun Jaitley started mentioning other issues for winding up the case and finally a probe from the Joint Parliamentary Committee of Opposition (JPC) Turned down the demand ' antat: congress saansadon dwaara chaukeedaar chor he ke naaron ke bich spikar ko loksabhaa kii kaarywahi aadhe ghante ke liye sthagit kerani padi
 Film Review: Yeongistan Actor: Miroom Farooq Sheikh Sahab, Jackie Bhagnani, Neha Sharma, Boman Irani, Kayoji Irani Director: Syed Ahmed Afzalduration: 2 hours 13 minutes Star: 2 in 5
 5disclemrasis film kii kahani ke sabhi paatr bhartiya raajnneeti se liye gaye hai
 The main characters are made up of Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi
 uske halaat or tark kamobesh vahi hai, jo gandhi parivaar ke rahe hai
 Bureaucrats act in the same manner as the powerful and trusted bureaucrat PN Haksar of Indira Gandhi's time
 yahaan tak ki film main pranav mukherjee, eke antni or mira kumaar jaise kirdaar bhi najar aate hai
 The main character of the film goes beyond his political inexperience to visit India, eats food in the house of the poor and finally gives the slogan of Mobile Democracy for Young India
 baat-baat par youth or change kii baat karata he
 By borrowing the comment of a viewer in a flat tone to the conclusion of the entire film, it seems Rahul Gandhi's PR exercise before the election
 ab aage padhein
 
 
 Youngistan is a film in the electoral atmosphere, which directly tries to show the changing nature of Indian politics
 hero abhimanyu kaul japan main rahata he or ek games develpar he
 She also has her live in girlfriend Anvita
 unki masti bhari duniya main bhuuchaal aata he, jab abhimanyu ke pita bharat ke pradhanmantri kaul sahab kaa achaanak cancer ke chalate dehanth ho jaataa he
 Things become such that all the old guards of Kaul Saheb's party make Abhimanyu the PM
 tark vaise hi rahete hai, jaise indira gandhi ko pradhanmantri banaate vakt rahe the
 a dumb doll, it will be easily managed
 abhimanyu ko jald hi samaj main aa jaataa he ki bharat jaise desh kaa piem bananaa kisi corporat job kii tarah nahin he, jahaan aap personal or prafational ko alag-alag rakh sakate hai
 Although there is a senior bureaucrat Akbar here to help him, Abhimanyu remains a little nervous in the first half
 liv in relation vipaksh or media ke haath kaa hathiyaar ban jaataa he or uski apni hi cabinet ke mantri use bas ek good boy samajhate hai, jise chunaav tak ke liye saleeb par chadha diya gaya he
 But suddenly Abhimanyu makes up his mind to take things in his hand
 use yakeen he ki liv in garlfriend ke saath bina shaadi ke baccha hone ko yang hindustan samajhegaa
 He makes policies for this Youngistan
 varisht bengali netaa ko president bana detaa he
 An ardent leader of the South, who is the Finance Minister, gives him the treatment by Morarji Desai and another leader Ajay Thakur gets sidelined in the brokerage of defense deals
 unamem veepi singh kii chhavi najar aati he
 It is another matter that VP Singh played the role of crusader, not the accused in Bofors scam
 aakhir main logon tak sidhe pahunchakar, bhaavnaatmak apil kar or raajnneetik daanv pech apana kar abhimanyu apane yangistan ke sahare 272 kaa magic figure paa letaa he
 Revolutionary decisions like voting through mobile phones are also used in this work
 vah genes pahanakar badlaav laata he or kahata he ki main na topi pahentaa hum or na hi pahanaataa hum
 The story of the film is very flat and superficially depicts the political conspiracies that make our complex democracy and its politics black and white
 film main vipaksh kamobesh nadaarad he
 It could be appreciated that someone made a film with a plot of real politics
 jaise sujith sarkaar ne madras cafe banaai thi
 But due to weak treatment, this effort could not be achieved
 film main abhimanyu kii anubhavheenata or anvita ke garlfriend atitude ke chalate kuch phani sichuation paidaa hoti hai, jin par public khub thahaake lagaati he
 Once, the PM goes to eat Matka Kulfi at three in the night
 dukandaar (brajend kaala) piem ko dekh abhibhoot ho jaataa he or vahiin jameen par haath jod baith jaataa he
 i see India as a shopkeeper who was sitting in front of a special name and dynasty with his mother-in-law to be like you
 acting kii baat karun to farrukh shaikh sahab ko parde par dekhakar ankhen bhar aati hai
 This was his last film
 or hameshaa kii tarah ek baar phir unhone laajawab abhinay kiya he
 Sheikh sir allaah ne nishchit hi aapako jananath bakshi hogi
 Jackie Bhagnani clearly has the highest focus in the film
 magar is role ke tamaam shades ko vah puri tarah se nibhaa nahin paae hai
 If his acting was strong, the film would have been better
 anvita ke role main neha sharma ne acha kaam kiya he
 The rest of the characters in the film are well-chosen and have played their part well
 film ke gane achche hai
 The first song is Party Song Tanki Hain Hum Jhumta Hai
 taj tumhaara main bhi acchhee melody he
 The director of the film Syed Ahmed Afzal has shown strength

 loksabhaa chunaav main mili haar ke baad congress party main manthan jari he
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi wants to go to every booth to find out the reason for the defeat and that is why he has spoken to the booth level workers and sought a detailed report from the state in-charge to find out the reasons for the defeat
 rahul vaise to congress adhyaksh kaa pad chhodana chaahate hai lekin party ke varisht netaaon ne vikalp na hone kaa hawala dekar philhal unhen pad par bane rahane ke liye manaa liya he
 The Congress has given all rights to make changes in the organization to Rahul Gandhi, in such a situation, the leaders are hopeful that Rahul Gandhi will soon be accepted to continue in this post
 vahiin, rahul bhi vikalp talashne kii baat kahkar philhal pad par bane hue hai
 While in office, Rahul is now busy getting to the root of the party's defeat
 booth str se maangi reporterahul ne sabhi rajyon ke prabhariyon se haar ke kaarnon kii jaankaree ke liye report taiyaar karke saunpane ko kaha he
 According to Rahul's close, this is a normal process, it is the president's routine job to ask for a report after the defeat
 khaas baat ye he ki, bataur adhyaksh rahul ne jo report maangi he, usamen booth str ke kaaryakartaaon se baat karke haar ke kaarnon kii jaankaree ikattha karne ko kaha gaya he
 It is believed that changes will be made at the party's work style and organization level only after this report arrives
 vahiin, duusari taraf bataur purvi upi kii prabharee or party mahasachiv priyanka gandhi bhi apni report rahul gandhi ko soupengi
 For this, Priyanka has started meeting the leaders of UP as well as the big leaders of the state and talks on the reasons for the defeat to outline the future
 sutron kii maane to priyanka jaldi hi upi main gelevaar jaakar booth str tak ke kaaryakartaaon se milakar haar kii samiksha karke bhavishya ke kadamon ko lekar report taiyaar karengi
 Penetration among the majority is important, however, in the initial talks, the leaders have told Priyanka that we should take part in the religious ceremonies of the majority class in the name of secularism, not just for the name
 netaaon ne priyanka ko yaad dilaayaa ki kaise pehle ramlila samitiyon, bhagwat katha ke aayojanon samet tamaam dharmik aayojanon ke mukhiya congress ke netaa hote the, lekin ab bahusankhyak aayojanon ke mukhiya bhaajapa ke netaa yaa unke kareebi hote hai
 Due to this, the penetration of the party in the majority class is becoming increasingly weak
 vaise bhale hi netaa apane alaakaman se bol paa rahe hon yaa nahin lekin aapasi baatcheet main ye bataanaa nahin bhoolatey ki, rahul kii iftaar party tasviren to saalon se saamne aati raheen, lekin ek baar ko chhod den to holi, diwaali or khaskar rakshabandhan jaise tyoharon par rahul-priyanka kii tasviren kyon nahin saamne aatin
 The workers do not stop here in the mutual conversation, they even say that, going to temple-to-temple, not just token or in elections, is going to be a matter, rather, if Rahul Gandhi describes himself as a janeudhari, Shiv bhakta, Hindu Brahmin This should also be seen in his everyday life
 is loksabhaa chunaav main congress sirf 52 siton par simat gai he
 In such a situation, it is no less than a challenge for the party to stand in front of the Modi wave

 Standard SMS Charges Applicable ” 'ayya' is a film directed by Rani Mukherjee by Sachin Kundalkar
 film kii kahani minakshi yani rani mukherjee ke ird-gird gumti he, jiske parivaar main unke mata-pita, daadi or ek bhai hai
 Everyone is worried that Meenakshi gets married somehow and for this, they look for a good groom
 minakshi ek art college main naukari karti hai or yahaan unki mulaakaat hoti he, college ke ek student prithviraj se, jinhen vah dil de baithti hai
 Throughout the rest of the film, Rani keeps trying to unravel the secret of Prithviraj and tell her heart
 sabase pehali baat
 
 
 The film looked as if director Sachin might have been confused as to which genre to put the film in, comedy or serious


 Because of this, the sudden comic scene breaks the emotional scene in between
 kuch seen dekhakar lagata he ki unki film main jarurat hi nahin thi
 Sometimes it seems difficult to understand what is happening, why it is happening
 
 
 tippaniyan In the film, Rani's grandmother, mother and brother are all acting in the same style
 sirf subodh bhaave, jo film main rani se shaadi karnaa chaahate hai or rani ke pita kii bhoomika main satish alekar ne apane−apane kirdaar ke saath nyaay kiya he
 Rani Mukherjee is a good actress, but she is not able to leave her mark due to the messy screen-play and wandering story
 kuch gane achche hai, par rani dance main mashkkat karti dikhin
 Instead of feeling the dance, she is seen stepping carefully one by one
 prithviraj ke paas karne ko bahut kuch nahin he, par film main apni maujuudagi dikhaane kii khub koshish karte hai
 Overall the rating for the rough journey of 'ayya' is - 1
 5 star
 
 
 Meenakshi works in an art college and meets Prithviraj, a college student whom she gives her heart

isaki vajah se achaanak aae comic seen, bhaavnaatmak seen ko bich main hi tod dete hai
 Seeing some scenes, it seems that there was no need in his film
 kahin-kahin yah samajhnaa mushkil lagata he ki kya ho rahaa he, kyon ho rahaa he
 
 
 The comments film main rani kii daadi, maa or bhai sabhi ek hi andaaj main acting kar rahe hai
 Only Subodh Bhave, who wants to marry Rani in the film and Satish Alekar in the role of Rani's father, has done justice to his character
 rani mukherjee acchhee abhinetri hai, par gadabad screen−play or bhatakati kahani kii vajah se vah apni chhap nahin chhod paati hai
 Some songs are good, but Rani was seen dancing
 vah dance ko mahasoos karne kii bajaay bade dhyaan se ek-ek step karti najar aati hai
 Prithviraj does not have much to do, but tries to show his presence in the film
 kul milakar 'ayya' ke ubad-khabad safar ke liye reating he- 1

 Scientists have advised to prohibit all types of construction work around the temple

 'why not see it: If you want to avoid violence, abuse, and violence
 yaa aap 18+ kii shrenee main nahin aate hai
 So this film is not for you
