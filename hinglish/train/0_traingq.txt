 Expectations of Jet Airways flying again were completely wiped out when the state-owned State Bank of India filed an appeal with the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) to initiate insolvency proceedings against the company
 buudhvaar ko ensielti is par sunwaayee karegaa
 Meanwhile, Jet Airways share price fell more than 70 percent in the last two days
 buudhvaar ke kaarobaar main jet airways kaa share 32 rupye prati share ke paas kaarobaar kar rahaa he
 The debt-ridden airlines will go bankrupt, but the big question is, who will take the sinking jet with them? The heat of loss is also expected to reach the common man's pocket
 ham apni is khabar main un vibhinn hitdharakon kii baat karenge jinhen jet airways ke band hone se nuksaan uthaanaa padegaa
 Huge loss to banks - How many planes are owned by Jet will be known only after the NCLT process starts
 lekin yah tay he ki bainkon ke karj ke baraabar mulya kii kul sampatti jet ke paas nahin he
 Banks owe Rs 8000 crore of debt to airlines
 aise main bainkon ko baari ghaataa uthaanaa padegaa, jise takneekee bhashaa main heirkat lenaa kehete hai
 Experts in the market believe that this haircut may be as high as 80 percent
 vendors bhi dikkat main – jet airways ko sevaayen dene vaale 100 se zyada vendors kaa 1 xxrep 4 0 karod rupye se zyada bakaayaa he
 These include leasing companies
 jin vendors ke liye jet airways sabase bada client tha unke astitv kaa sankat bhi saamne hoga
 That is, Jet will also spoil the economic health of more than 100 vendors who used to supply goods or services
 karmchaaree par sankat – jet ke 23000 karmchaariyon ke kareeb 3000 karod bakaayaa hai
 Employees have not received salaries since March
 in karmchaariyon ko na keval aarthik haani hi hui he balki nai naukari kaa sankat bhi inke saamne khadaa he
 Investor losses - Investors who invested in Jet sank more than 90 per cent in the past year
 ek saal pehle jet airways ke share kii keemat 399 rupye prati share ke kareeb thim, jo buudhvaar ko 32 rupye prati share ke kareeb kaarobaar kar rahi hai
 Those millions of investors whose capital was absorbed by investing in Jet will not get any relief from NCLT
 aam janata ko bhi nuksaan – jet main gadabadiyaan bhale company ke pravartakon ne kii hon, karj dekar bainkon ne kii hon yaa galat nitiyaan banaakar sarkaar yaa niamakon main lekin yah samaj lijie ki jab ke doobane se sadak par chalata aam aadmi bhi prabhavit hoga bhale usne jivan main kabhi bhi jet airways main safar na kiya ho
 Understand how, banks will have to bear this loss if the 26 banks which owe Rs 8500 crores owed to SBI
 is nuksaan se bainkon kii puunji kam hogi or puunji kii kami sarkaar taxperes ke paise se bainkon main pun: puunjikaran karke puri karegi
 The sinking of the jet will also have many negative effects on the aviation sector of the country

 darasal, giriraaj singh ne buudhvaar ko sonia gandhi or unke parivaar par nijee hamalaa kiya tha, jiskaa congress samet sabhi rajnatik dalon ne virodh kiya tha
 Today, the Congress is protesting across the country to protest against Giriraj's remarks
 patrakaron dwaara is sambandh main sawaal puche jane par sonia gandhi ne jawaab dene se inkaar kar diya
 The leaders of Giriraj Singh's party himself applied his class for this comment
 aisi khabaren ain ki vittamantri arun jetali or bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne giriraaj se maafi maangane ko kaha, jiske baad giriraaj singh ne saarvajanik taur par khed jataayaa tha
 Giriraj had said in Hajipur, Bihar, that if Rajiv Gandhi had married a woman from Nigeria and that woman was not white, would the Congress still accept him as their leader? apni is tippanee par chautarafa aalochana jhelane ke baad giriraaj ne buudhvaar ko is par khed vyakt karte hue kaha tha ki unhone yah tippanee anaupchaarik baatcheet ke dauraan kii thi
 Giriraj said, during informal conversation many things happen
 yadi meri tippaniyon se sonia ji yaa rahul ji ko thes pahunchi he, to main khed vyakt karata hum

 After the loan waiver of farmers by the new Congress governments in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, the demand for giving benefits to the farmers across the country is gaining momentum
 donon rajyon ke baad bijepi shasit gujarat or assam main bhi kisaanon kii riyaayat dete hue karjamaafee kii kavayad shuru hui he
 There is a stir in the NITI Aayog after Congress President Rahul Gandhi's statement of not giving gold to PM Modi till the debt of farmers across the country is waived
 niti ayog ke upaadhyaksh rajeev kumaar ne enditivi se kaha- agar puure desh main aise halaat hote hai ki karjamaafee jaruri he to centre sarkaar is bare main sochegi
 Once this decision has been taken in 2008
 agar jaruri hua to is masale par kam se kam baat to ho hi sakati he
 It is possible to consider this proposal
 vahiin unhone yah bhi kaha ki niti ayog kaa maananaa he ki karj maafee koi samaadhaan nahin he
 This is the responsibility of the state governments
 isamen centre or rajya kaa koi dakhal nahin bunata he
 NITI Aayog suggested that the state governments should take the decision of loan waiver only after looking at their financial condition
 udhar jiesti par pradhanmantri ke bayaan par tippanee karte hue rajeev kumaar ne kaha ki ye pahal jarur honi chahie
 Currently 97 percent of the goods are in the slabs of 18 percent GST or below

 rail mantri mallikarjun khadge ne antarim bajet pesh to kar diya lekin sadan main itnaa shor sharaaba tha ki koi use sun bhi nahin paaya
 It is a matter of shame that when such important matters and announcements are being made, a handful of members were making noise like chaotic elements
 unhone spikar ke aagrah ko darkinar karte hue jis tarah kii besharmi dikhaai, uski jitani ninda kii jaae, kam he
 However, the Railway Minister while presenting the greed to rob public applause, presented a budget that can be praised
 unhone railway kii najuk aarthik sthiti ko samajha or uske anuroop koi aisa prastaav nahin rakhaa jisase railway kii haalat or bigade
 The Railway Minister made the work of the incoming Railway Ministers easier by announcing the Rail Tariff Authority for the matter of increasing fares, because now the increase or decrease of the fares will not be directly in their hands and the authority will keep making recommendations in this regard from time to time
 
 unhone premium rail gaadiyaan chalaane kii ghoshnaa karke ek bada kadam uthaaya he
 These will not only run additional trains but their fares will not be normal but they will be based on simple rules of supply and demand
 inase railway ko atirikt aay to hogi hi, yatriyon kii bhugtan kshamta ke mutabik unhen vikalp milegaa
 Like airplanes, their fares will keep on increasing
 bhartiya rail desh kaa sabase bada niyokta he
 The livelihood of millions of people rests on this
 ise aarthik rup se majboot bananaa jaruri he
 For some time now we are seeing that the railway is lagging behind in freight
 desh main jis tarah se udyogon kii taadaad badi, us hisaab se relon ko maal zyada dhonaa chahie tha
 This would have improved its economic condition but it did not happen and it is not able to compete with road transport which is more dear to the customers
 iskaa ilaaj is bajet main bahut thodaa dikhaai detaa he
 It is very important for the railways to carry maximum cargo and increase its revenue because most of the passenger trains run at a loss
 maal dhulaai ke lakshya ko rail mantri ne badha to diya he lekin vah apane lakshya main kitne safal ho pate hai, yah aane vaala samay batayega
 Actually, apart from making the process of sending goods easy, their timely delivery is very important, only when this happens, businessmen will connect with the railways on a large scale
 yatri suraksha railway ke liye hameshaa hi bada mudda rahaa he
 There is no significant emphasis on this budget
 yah ek bahut bada mudda he or railway ko iske liye tamaam kadam uthaane chahie
 The timely operation of trains and passenger safety are two issues in which there is no scope for more or less
 yah rail bajet is myne main saraahaa ja saktaa he ki chunaav sir par hone ke baavjood rail mantri ne koi aisa kadam nahin uthaaya he jise vishuddh populist kaha ja sake

 udyogpati chhot gaye
 The result of the seven-year hearing is that there is no evidence
 ghotaalaa hi nahin hua he
 In the name of appeal in the High Court, can political bread be baked on its fire
 yah maamla court ke daayre se baahar jaataa he
 The country should know what happened
 sieji kii report kis makasad se bani thi, kya diemke or udyogpatiyon ko raahat dene ke liye jaanch ke str par kotahi barti gai
 Congress Rajya Sabha MP Vivek Tankha has questioned how no one knows how the CAG report was leaked, the report which was to be placed in Parliament, but before that the report was leaked
 jab saboot nahin hai, aaropee chhot chuke hai tab phir kis ghotaale kii baat ho rahi he
 Appeal is being talked about in the High Court, on 30 December 2014, in the Sohrabuddin fake encounter case, Amit Shah was acquitted from the special CBI court, till date the appeal is not filed
 disambar 2017 aane ja rahaa he
 Does the CBI decide the appeal by asking someone
 kya yahi paardarshee or nishpaksh system he
 Our colleague Ashish Bhargava has also written some other things about the decision in his report, the judge has written that nobody listened to the telecom department
 sabhi ne maan liya ki ye bada ghotaalaa he jabaki aisa ghotaalaa nahin tha
 The comments sibiai ke bare main court kii tippanee dilachasp he
 Judge OP Saini has written that the CBI did a very good choreography of this case
 aisa koi ricard yaa saboot nahin jisase aparaadh sabit hota ho
 The official documents have been misinterpreted and out of context in the charge sheet
 gavaahon kii maukhik gavaahi ke aadhaar par aaropapatr daayar kiya gaya
 While the witnesses in the court did not say all this
 aarope patr main kai tathy galat hai
 The prosecution failed to prove the charge sheet
 jaj opi saini kii yah tippanee sabake liye chintaa kii baat honi chahie
 Is it so easy to fabricate a false case and send someone to jail on false charges and create a national movement
 kya sab kuch jhooth sabit ho jayega
 a lot is at stake
 yah sibiaai ne tab ke telecom mantri e raja par 200 karod ke ghoose lene kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 Which was given through the TV channel of DMK MP Kanimozhi
 e raja or kanimoi donon bari kar die gaye
 The investigation has been going on for seven years, the special judge kept waiting for the evidence every day, the evidence did not come
 yah baat zaruri he
 Before the original thing is lost in the political Tu Tu Main I, it is important to keep in mind that all the accused in that 2G scam have been acquitted in the 2G scam which created a political storm in the country
 zarur trial court kaa faisla he, magar jaanch supreme court kii nigaraanee main hui he, hai court ne jaj tay kiya tha
 The CBI has said that it will appeal in the High Court
 jaj opi saini kaa bayaan mahatvapurn he ki sibiai yaa koi bhi saboot hi pesh nahin kar paaya he
 Did the CAG give a wrong report at that time that the government treasury has been damaged by 1 lakh 76 thousand crores in the 2G case
 tab sara desh sann rah gaya tha ki paune do lakh karod kaa bhi ghotaalaa ho saktaa he
 Can there be such a big lapse with the CAG, then we have to question the CAG as well
 agar itani badi sanstha kii report kaa yah haal he to uski un report kaa kya karen jisamen wo nitiyon or lagu hone kii kamiyaan ginaata he
 1552 is a judgment of pages and the accused is not one, the evidence is not able to prove even one
 yah kaalpanik katha he yaa vaaki main aisa hua he
 In this case former Telecom Minister a Raja, former DMK MP Kanimoi Karunanidhi, Kanimozhi's mother and Karunanidhi's wife Dayalu Amma, former Telecom Secretary Siddharth Behura, a Raja's former private secretary RK Chandolia, Shahid Balwa, Surendra Pipara, Hari Nair, Gautam Doshi, Vinod Goenka, Asif Balwa, Rajiv Aggarwal, Karim Morani, Sharad Kumar, Sanjay Chandra are all acquitted
 kisi ke khilaaf saboot hi nahin pesh kar pai sibiai
 14 people remained in jail for several months
 e raja ko istipha dena padaa tha
 After this decision, the statement of Mukul Rohatgi, former Solicitor General of Modi government is important
 mukul rohtagi ne kaha he ki aap jis bhi tarah se dekhie, aapraadhik maamla nahin banataa he
 The tornado that caused the loss of 1 lakh 76 thousand crores is not correct
 hamaare sahyogi ashish bhargav ne mukul rohtagi se baat kii
 The 1 lakh 76 thousand crore scam figure was made on the CAG report when Vinod Rai was the CAG
 vinod raay ko modi sarkaar ne padam bhushan diya he, bank board beuro kaa chairman banaaya he or supreme court ne unhen bisisiai kii prashaskeey samiti main rakhaa he
 Whether Vinod Rai gave the wrong report, took the wrong advantage of trust in the institution, did the media get caught in the Vinod Rai report, this decision has proved all the history between 2011 and 2014 to be false
 sabake sab sawaalon ke kathghare main hai yahaan tak ki is jhooth par yakeen karne vaali janata bhi
 Vinod Rai also wrote a book after retiring from the post of CAG
 jiskaa tital tha Not just an accountant, the diary of the nation conciosukeeper, 21 disambar ke faisle ke sandarbh main kitaab kaa tital hi ulataa padhaa ja saktaa he, jaise vinod raay sirf lekhaakaar nahin the, kuch or the, or desh kii antaratma ke prahari kii diary, antaratma se jhooth bolne vaale kii diary lagati he
 Vinod Rai did not talk to anyone today
 phone se sampark karne kaa prayaas kiya gaya magar saamne nahin aae
 At that time when there was talk of 1 lakh 76 thousand crores scam, then Congress leader and senior lawyer Kapil Sibal used to say zero loss while being a minister
 kapil sibbal kaa aaj tak mazaaq udata he ki jiro los kaha tha
 After the verdict, Sibal said that zero loss was proved right
 vinod raay ko sabhi padon se barkhaast kar diya janaa chahie, unhone puure desh se jhooth bolaa tha
 When there was no evidence, no accused even then what could have been such a big scam
 faisla aisa he ki saazish kii theory bhi kamazor pad jaati he, kya modi sarkaar ke rahete sibiai jaanboojh kar cese ko kamazor kar sakati he, kya modi sarkaar itnaa bada jokhim uthaa sakati he, ye sab sawaal hai
 This decision changed the character of the media
 anna andolan hua
 Anchors started asking questions to the country and people felt that there was no one in the country other than the anchor
 ek majboot netaa chahie jo bolne vaala ho
 Was it all built on the foundation of a lie
 2ji scam ke vakt tatkaaleen pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne 3 janvari 2014 ko media ke saath vishesh baatcheet kii jisamen kaha tha ki media se zyaada itihaas mere prati dayaalu rahegaa
 Is the talk of Manmohan Singh getting right, the man who used to laugh at everything about Manmohan Singh, what is happening today that his everything seems to be on target
 jaj opi saini ne apane faisle main ek or baat kahi he
 Not a single person came
 yah ishaara karata he ki har koi us dharna se prabhavit tha jo afvaah, gapp or atakalbaaziyon ke aadhaar par banaai gai thi
 Rumors have no place in judicial processes
 bijepi maanane ko taiyaar nahin he ki 2ji spectrum ghotaalaa nahin hua tha
 The same statement is being made by the party and the government that the policies were framed in a corrupt way
 vitt mantri jetali kah rahe hai ki sieji kii report ke aadhaar par supreme court ne aavanton radd kiya tha
 But Judge OP Saini has said in his judgment that not a single evidence was presented and the assumption was made on the basis of rumors
 congress aakraamak he
 She is seeking cleanliness from Prime Minister Modi
 purv sieji vinod raay ke kilaaf karrwai kii maang kar rahi he
 p Chidambaram has said that the UPA government was demolished by spreading rumors of a false scam
 anand sharma ne kaha he ki jhooth kii buniyaad par bhrashtachar virdohi andolan chalaa
 The Congress government also passed the Lokpal Act, but it has been more than three years, the process of appointing the Lokpal has not started
 2G ghotaale kii baat ne desh kii telecom industry ko lambey samay ke liye tabah kar diya
 This employment sector became a layoffs sector
 license radd hue
 Thousands of people lost their jobs in this sector
 kya iskaa sambandh tamilandu kii raajnneeti se bhi he
 Recently, Prime Minister went to his house to know DMK chief Karunanidhi's condition
 kya is faisle ke baad bijepi diemke ko apane paale main le legi, kya ek gathbandhan ke liye itnaa bada siyaasi daanv chalaa ja saktaa he, tamilnadu main gathbandhan hoga to desh main sawaal nahin uthegaa ki 2ji ghotaale ke aaropee kahaan hai, wo bijepi ke saath kyon hai, wo bari kyon ho gaye
 An anecdote was created on the basis of lies
 kya sab kuch itnaa saral hota he ki pradhanmantri diemke se gathbandhan kar len or idhar 2ji ghotaale main uske netaaon ko chhudvaa den
 Why would the Prime Minister want to put his anti-corruption image at stake
 aane vaale dinon main dekhie ki diemke kii raajnneeti kis taraf jaati he, unki taraf koun jaataa he
 Judge OP Saini has written this matter in his Judgment
 sibiai kaa kahana he ki jo kamiyaan rah gayi hai ham unka bachaav karenge
 Our main plea was not considered
 jaj opi saini ne daleel kii baat nahin kahi he, kaha he ki sibiai koi bhi saboot pesh nahin kar pai
 The CBI says that their written evidence was not adhered to
 rajaneta chhot gaye
 Industrialists missed out

 The scam has not happened
 hoicourt main apil ke naam par kya isaki aag par siyaasi roti senki ja sakati he
 This matter goes beyond the purview of the court
 desh ko pataa chalanaa chahie ki hua kya tha
 For what purpose was the CAG report made, whether the DMK and the industrialists were taken aback at the level of investigation to give relief
 congress ke rajyasabha saansad vivek tankhaa ne sawaal kiya he ki sieji kii report kaise li hui kisi ko pataa nahin, jis report ko sansad main rakhaa janaa tha, magar iske pehle hi report li kar di gai
 When there is no evidence, the accused have escaped, then which scam is being talked about
 hoicourt main apil kii baat ho rahi he, 30 disambar 2014 ko soharabuddin phek encounter maamle main amit shah special sibiai court se bari hue to aaj tak apil file nahin he
 December 2017 is going to come
 kya sibiai kisi se puch kar apil kaa faisla karti he
 Is this a transparent and fair system? hamaare sahyogi ashish bhargav ne apni report main faisle ke bare main kuch anya baaten bhi likhi hai, jaj ne likhaa he ki telecom mahakme kii baat kisi ne nahin suni
 Everyone accepted that it was a big scam whereas it was not
 tippaniyan The court's comment about the CBI is interesting
 jaj opi saini ne likhaa he ki sibiai ne is cese kii badi acchhee koreography kii
 There is no record or evidence that proves the crime
 aarope patr main aadhikarik dastavezon kii galat or sandarbh se hat kar vyakhya kii gai he
 The chargesheet was filed on the basis of oral testimony of the witnesses
 jabaki court main gavaahon ne yah sab nahin kaha
 Many facts in the charge sheet are incorrect
 abhiyojan paksh aarope patr sabit karne main naakaam rahaa
 This comment by Judge OP Saini should be a matter of concern for everyone
 kya itnaa aasaan he jhootha cese gadhana or jhuthe aaropon main kisi ko jail bhejnaa or ek rashtriya andolan khadaa kar dena
 Will everything prove to be a lie? bahut kuch daanv par laga he
 This CBI accused the then Telecom Minister a Raja of taking bribe of 200 crores

 Will the BJP take the DMK into its fold after this decision, can such a big political bet be for an alliance, if there is an alliance in Tamil Nadu, then there will be no question in the country that where are the accused in the 2G scam, they are with the BJP Why are they, why are they acquitted
 kya jhooth ke aadhaar par ek kissa gadha gaya
 Is everything so simple that the Prime Minister should tie up with the DMK and get rid of its leaders in the 2G scam here? pradhanmantri bhrashtachar virdohi apni chhavi daanv par kyon lagaana chahenge

 After the crushing defeat against India, the Pakistan cricket team is being targeted not only on the field but also on social media
 asia kapmen bharat ne pakistan sabase badi jeet darj karte hue use 9 wicket se maat di, jiske baad top ballebaajababar ajampak cricket premiyon ke nishane par aa gaye
 Actually, Pakistan batsman Fakhar slipped on the pitch while jamballing and was called LBW
 lekin non strike par khadey babar ajam ne unhen rivyuu lene se inkaar kar diya
 However, it was later revealed that Fakhar was not out and the ball was in his hand
 agar babar unhen rivyuu kii salaah dete to pakistan ke wicket kaa patan nahin hota
 Fakhar was dismissed after scoring 31 runs
 Terrible advice by Babar Azam to Fakhar not to take the review even though Fakhar would have survived
 He then gets out by a meter and takes the review for himself
 This is atrocious conduct
 - Syed Talat Hussain (@ talathussain12) September 23, 2018 On the other hand, in-form Babar Azam himself was also out for 9 runs
 isse pehle unhone fakhar jamaal ke saath duusare wicket ke liye 31 ran jode the
 Had the pair of these two settled on the ground a few overs, Pakistan would not have had such a situation
 yahi vajah se ki soshal media par pakistani phens babar ko is haar kaa villen bataa rahe hai or unhen 2 wicket giraane kaa jimmedaar bhi maanate hai
 Yesterday Imam ul Haq and today Babar Azam advised Fakhar not to take review
 Both proved wrong
 Who is coaching them on this

 ashok gahalot ne pichley dinon rajasthan ke mukhyamantri ke taur par chaar saal puure kiye
 This is his second term
 unka pehla kaarykaal 1998 se 2003 ke bich rahaa tha, jiske baad ve bhartiya janata party kii vasundhara raaje se haar gaye the
 Despite his 9 years of political experience and Sonia Gandhi being the beloved Chief Minister, the examples of how bad the administration is in his reign are the events of the last few days
 gahalot ko ab gandhi bhi boj lagane lage hai
 For two decades, Gehlot, who has called himself Gandhi and the pure Gandhian Chief Minister of Marwar through the media, has now started saying that he did not read Gandhi and should not be compared to Gandhi
 ve sweekaar karte hai ki gandhi ko bamushkil jaanate hai
 He insisted that he should not be called as Gandhi of Marwar or Rajasthan
 aaj gahalot ek aise netaa ke rup main prachaarit ho chuke hai jin par aarope hai ki ve apane kareebi logon kii companiyon ko khub paisa banane detaa he, jinhen jaminen, jhilein, apartment banane ke liye kanoonon main riyaayat, jal or siver kii pipelinon or saura urja pariyojnaon main manmarjee theke aadi thaal main sajaa kar de die jate hai or yah sab janata kii gadhi kamai ke paise or sarkari jameenon kii keemat par kiya jaataa he
 In Rajasthan, corruption has touched new heights under the rule of Gehlot because the fear of law and order among the officers is over
 gahalot prashasan or police sambandhi ek bhi kamyaabi ginane ke laayak nahin hai
 One example would be enough
 rajasthan ke atirikt mukhya sachiv ve
 s
 singh kii maut subah kii saiyr ke dauraan sadak paar karte vakït hui, jab ve divyder par khadey the
 He was crushed by an Alto car
 jis tareeke se maut hui, usne sabko chaunkaa diya lekin police ke maathe par shikan tak nahin ai
 The police immediately called it a road accident, based on the only statement of an Alto driver named Deendayal, who said that he hit Singh and another officer, Vijender, in an affair to save a person
 iske baad se is ghatana main kai virodhabhas saamne aae hai
 This incident shows how incompetent, and unprofessional the police are in the Gehlot administration
 gahalot ke paas grih mantralay bhi he, police sidhe unke niyantran main aati he
 The responsibility of killing the 7-year-old girl Naina also falls on the administration, who was abducted from her home
 karauli jile main pappu sharma ke donon haath kaatane kii javabdehi bhi gahalot par hi he jo satta main chaar saal puure hone kaa utsav manaa rahe hai
 Just before the Pravasi Divas Conference in January 2012, Urban Development Minister Shanti Dhariwal, with the permission of Gehlot, adorned Jaipur with Rs 35 crore within two weeks
 phoonk die the
 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was to attend this event
 us samay bani sadaken or kiya gaya chuunaa dekhte-dekhte jhad gaya or pravaasiyon ko lubhaane ke liye banaae gaye shauchalay tab se kaam main hi nahin aae hai
 Now engineers are also agreeing that the work done in a hurry was inferior, but this excuse is actually being given so that more money can be withdrawn for the same work again
 shahari vikaas mantralay ne dallalon or bhu-mafiaon kii badi madad kii he
 He first announced the new Jaipur, then canceled it after four years
 aise aarope hai ki dhariwal or unki chuni afasaron kii team—jisamen gahalot ke log bhi shaamil hai—ne bilderon ko khuleam biloj or master plan kaa ulanghan karne kii chhot di
 There have been several incidents of atrocities of minorities
 gopalgarh golibari cond is maamle main sabase bura tha, jisamen 10 musalmaan maare gaye
 Due to the manner in which Gehlot kept pressing Bhanwari Devi's CD, Bhanwari Devi was killed and after which one of his ministers Mahipal Maderna and MLA Malkhan Singh were taken into custody
 gahalot ke apane jile jodhpur main samasyaon kaa ambara he
 There have been many cases of maternal and child deaths and adulterated drugs
 vikaas dar teji se neeche saraki he, berogari badhati ja rahi he, mahangaai bhi aasmaan chhu rahi he
 Tourism has taken a destructive form
 rajya ke netritv kii adoordarshita saaf dikhaai detii he
 Gehlot has ruled for a long time and he is not worried about winning anymore, but how is he going to retire? It is now in the hands of the BJP how it ensures its victory

 a Delhi gang rape accused has been considered as a minor by the court
 adaalat ne aaropee ke skool ke principal dwaara dikhaae register ke aadhaar par uski umr tay kii he
 This is the minor who is accused of the most brutal act of the girl
 is puure ghatana kram ne ek badi bahes ko janm de diya he, kya kanoon main bal aparaadhiyon kii umr seemaa 18 saal se kam kii jaani chahie
 Should there be a provision of Rare of the Rare in child crimes also? dilli gangrape main jis shaks kii karatuut sabase ghinauni thi use sabase kam sajaa hogi 
 The boy who committed the most brutality with the victim girl could be sentenced to a maximum of three years
 jis balaatkaar cond ne puure desh ko dahala kar rakh diya, uske sabase krur gunahagaar ke saamne aaj kanoon bhi bebas najar aayaa
 The police and the entire law and order system can no longer punish him for his crimes, as it has been proved in a Delhi court that he was under 18 years of age
 16 disambar, jis taarikh ko us ladke ne apni krur harkaton se puure desh kii ruh kampa di thi, us din uski umr thi 17 saal, 6 maheene or 12 din
 That is, this compulsion of law of 5 months and 18 days has given him such an impetus, by which he will escape his most dreadful crime by serving a sentence of just three years
 dilli police ne jo cese taiyaar kiya he uske mutabik is 6the naaballig aaropee ne hi 16 disambar kii raat peedit ladki or uske dost ko bas main baithne ko bulaayaa tha
 The same girl raped the girl twice
 yaheen nahin duusari baar usne ladki se tab balaatkaar kiya jab wo behosh ho chuki thi
 Then this minor had asked both of them to throw him out of the bus
 dilli police ke in tamaam daavon or naaballig aaropee ke gunahon kii tasdik bas main savaar peedit ladki kaa dost bhi kar chukaa he
 After the incident of 16 December, a big debate had started in the whole country
 kya juvenil justise act main naaballig aparaadhiyon kii umr seemaa kam kar deni chahie? kya juvenil justise act main bhi rer of di reerest gunahon kaa praavdhaan hona chahie taaki aise maamalon main naaballigon ko bhi kadi sajaa mil sake?16 disambar kii ghatana ke baad balaatkaar par kade kanoon banane ke liye bani justise verma kamity bhi apni siforishein de chuki he
 Justice Verma is not entitled that the age limit of minors should be reduced
 neshnal krime beuro ke aankade bataate hai ki aparaadh main shaamil naaballigon main 65 fisadi 16 se 18 saal ke bich hote hai
 The National Crime Bureau figures and the December 16 incident have sparked a new debate in the country at the moment whether minors involved in such a disgusting crime should really be considered minors

 Choi Young Joo, director of Overseas Business at the Itus Academy, says, "IIT is the most famous brand of Indian education abroad and Kota is its hub

 Maheshwari says that in 1997 he had selected 12 faculty members through campus placements

 Today, around 35 per cent of the people associated with coaching are from IIT

 'the reason for students to focus more on coaching than school is that the engineering entrance exam is completely different from class 12th
 institutes ne is maukey kaa laabh uthaaya or skulon se contract kar liya
 In such a system, students get their names written in these schools, but do not go to class
 isaki jagah ve ejineering kii taiyaari main lag jate hai or 12veen class kii pariksha ke samay hi skool jate hai
 Such institutes have opened their own schools, where they enroll children from class VI and prepare for IIT

 Pramod Maheshwari of Career Point says, "the new format will increase students' dependence on coaching centers
 isse students par dabaav doguna ho jayega
 Earlier they used to resort to coaching for entrance examination
 ab ve board pariksha ke liye bhi koching kaa sahaara lenge
 Govind Maheshwari, director of the Ellen Career Institute, says that many institutes tried to gain a foothold in the quota, but were not successful
 kota ke institute ab guwahati, patna, chandigarh or bangaloru jaise duusare shaharon main bhi apni branch khol rahe hai
 But Bansal says that student quota will be coming for students seeking admission in engineering

 aaj sthiti yah he ki kakadev or aasapaas ke ilaakon main akele ejineering or medical kii pravesh parikshaon kii taiyaari karaane ke liye chote-bade 100 se adhik centre kaam kar rahe hai
 These coaching centers mainly consist of Bhabha Classes, New Speed institute, Sigma Classes, New Light Coaching Institute, Raj Kushwaha Classes and Anees Srivastava Classes

 He says, 'the coaching fees for an engineering subject in Kanpur is Rs 15,000

 tippaniyan He says in question that if the US can 'kill Osama bin Laden by entering Pakistan' and India can do a surgical strike, then why are our security forces not allowed to attack the Naxalites in their area? He said that he does not have much faith in the government's strategy against the Naxalites

 ) The Congress on Monday conducted a political stunt in Ganaur, Sonepat, Haryana, to project the Messianic image of Rahul Gandhi
 kisaanon se baatcheet karne pahunche rahul ne pehle ek lanbaa bhaashan diya, jo kamobesh unke puraane bhaashanon jaisaa hi tha
 After this, when the round of question and answer came, Mike Rural Development Minister Jairam Ramesh took hold and instead of giving the delegates a chance, they started asking themselves
 masalan jairam ne pehla sawaal bhatta parsul kii ghatana or bhoomi adhigrahan ke sambandh main poocha
 In response, Rahul spoke almost the same thing in the syrup of sentimentality that he has said before on many forums
 party ko loktantric banane kaa vijan saamne rakhte hue unhone kaha ki agle 5 saal main vah congress ko aisi party bananaa chaahate hai jahaan party netritv nahin, majdoor or kisaan chunavi candidet chunenge
 He said that what he learned from the farmers, he could not teach the bureaucrats
 congress upaadhyaksh ne purv pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi or varisht bijepi netaa laal krishna adwani par unke pita rajeev gandhi kaa uphaas udaane kaa aarope lagaaya
 He said, 'when my father brought a computer to the country, senior BJP leaders Vajpayee ji and Advani ji made fun of him by saying' Computer Boy '
 baad main pramod mahajan iskaa shrey bijepi ko dene lage
 But today if you have a mobile phone in your pocket, it is only because of my father's thinking
 'rahul ne kaha ki ham aapako (kisaanon ko) vikalp dena chaahate hai, aadesh nahin
 Ordering is bjp's job
 vipakshi party par prahaar karte hue unhone satta ke vikendrikaran kii vakaalat kii
 He said that BJP thinks that only one person can run the country, whereas Congress wants to give strength to the people of India
 manaregaa, artiai or panchayat raaj isi ke udhaaharan hai
 The Congress Vice President alleged that the BJP presents the achievements of the Congress by making it their own
 unhone modi kaa naam liye bina kaha ki vipakshi dal sardaar patel ko bhi apane paale main lene kii koshish main he
 Read what Rahul Gandhi said and he spoke: How many people want to see their sons working in the fields here? Nobody wants it
 to hamaari soch kya he
 We do not want to tell you that your sons should not do farming
 wo aapkaa faisla he
 We just want to tell you that the option should be in your hands
 kheti main paisa nahin banataa
 Loss deal
 to pehla kaam hamaara, jo maine jameen kii baat kii
 If you make land, you will get security in it 
 magar vahaan nahin ruknaa chaahate
 We say that your sons should have the same opportunity as others
 ye kahaan se aegi
 Will come from employment and what kind of employment
 sarvice or menuphaccharing
 So in the last five-seven years, we talked about this Mumbai Manufacturing Corridor
 dilli mumbai
 mumbai-chennai dedicated railway fret coridor
 We have prepared the network
 ab isamen udyog lagenge or chois milegi aapke bacchon ko
 Our politics is to give you a choice
 order dene kii nahin
 That is the work of the BJP
 ham chaahate hai ki aapaki jo shakti he, uskaa prayog hindustan kare
 There is talk of politics
 hooda ji or jairam ramesh ji baithe hai
 Many complaints come
 jairam ji ke bare main shikaayat aati he ki bhai mantri nahin sunate hai
 So what is the problem? do teen jagah se tikat kii baat uthi
 Farmers do not appear in ticket distribution in the cabinet
 usamen aapaki hissedari nahin
 Till we have not changed it, we can talk like this
 main 10 saal se raajnneeti main hum
 Power is also needed to make a sound
 jab tak hamane aapako tikat ke process main nahin daalaa, tab tak shakti nahin aa sakati
 So in 15 seats, we asked people to give tickets
 ye meri soch he ki ek aisa din aae, jab aisi meeting jarur ho, jab tikat kii baat aae to aapaki line lag jaae
 What happens nowadays to farmers, laborers, Hooda ji and i and Jairam ji choose tickets
 hooda ji muskura rahe hai
 i am also smiling
 magar aisa din aana chahie, jab kisaan chune, majdoor chune
 And when the MP is sitting, he feels that the brother is not working, then there is pressure
 janata main se koi: yah kitne saal main ho jayega?rahul: ye main paanch saat saal main kar duungaa
 My problem is to understand you
 ye jo nirnay hote hai, aasaan nahin hote
 Hooda ji will also tell you
 isamen log gussa ho jate hai
 Become depressed jor lagata he
 i say you guys choose
 agar aap sab raajnneetik dalon ko dekhen
 See BJP, Congress, Left
 hindustan main karpshan kii baat karte hai
 There are many people who give their speech
 sirf bhaashan dete hai
 The main problem is that India needs to bring changes in the Lok Sabha and the Legislative Assembly
 50 fisadi mahilaon ke bare main baat kariye
 This is a meeting of farmers
 is meeting main kitne log hai
 400 people
 magar vahaan par dekhie
 Four - eight women
 ek aisa din aana chahie, jab ham kisaanon kii meeting bulaaen to 50 fisadi mahilaayein dikhaai jaaen or 50 fisadi
 i will brother main karuunga
 But what is the main point? main aapse lanbaa bol rahaa hum ki hindustan main jaankaree aapke paas he
 The farmer has
 mazdooron ke paas he
 The carpenter has it
 mahilaon ke paas he
 But we do not ask you
 system aapako bataata he
 i want us in the Congress party to start asking you
 kabhi kabhi hamen acha nahin lagegaa
 But we will ask
 ye hamamen or bijepi main fark he
 There is a thinking in the BJP that one person can run this country
 duniya kaa puraa gyaan ek vyakti ko he
 He knows about farming
 hawaii jahaaj ke bare main jaanata he
 What is the thinking that centralize power
 ham ulta kehete hai ki power hindustan kii janata ko do
 MANREGA
 artiai, panchayat raaj isi ke udhaaharan hai
 You all came, thank you very much
 jairam ramesh:ek minute baith jaaie
 This will not do
 rahul ji chale jaaenge
 You calm down aap baith jaaie
 See, right now Rahul ji has put his thoughts and ideas in front of you yahaan rahul ji maujuud hai
 Issues related to the farmer should be given priority, that is being discussed
 mike mere haath main he
 i want to ask Rahul ji two questions directly
 aap bhatta parsul gaye
 What are you thinking aapane kaha, bhoomi adhigrahan adhinium badalanaa he
 What are you thinking? Rahul: Not just Bhatta Parsaul
 niamgiri main or puure hindustan main dikh rahaa he
 The farmer owned land
 or uske haath main shakti nahin thi
 i saw it in UP
 sarkaar ek din order detii thi, duusare din gaayab
 Made a Formula One track somewhere
 use saal main ek baar yuj kiya ja saktaa he
 Brother too, you saw how it is going
 shaayad do teen saal main band bhi ho jaae
 See how many farmers land in a minute, brother to see Formula One
 gaadiyaan chakkar kaatengi
 Take the land, then justice should be done
 agar koi dilli main rahata he
 So we say that if you want to sell the land, then sell it
 magar jab kisaan kii jameen hoti he ki agar ham aapaki jameen lenaa chaahate hai, to le sakate hai
 you can not do anything
 tarika bhi galat he
 i went to Bhatta Parsaul
 vahaan mahila ro rahi thi
 Asked what happened boli, ek din aae or bole jameen aapaki nahin
 Didn't write anything
 jinhen jameen di, wo aa gaye or bole ye jameen aapaki nahin
 i got it
 dukh hua hoga aapako
 She did not say that she was sad for another reason
 jameen par meri fasal thi
 i said let me get this crop out
 unhone jaakar fasal jala di
 Now look, this is thinking
 ki ham usko sirf dabaaenge nahin, balki khatm kar denge
 This has to change
 niamgiri ke bare main kahana chahta hum
 Brother, this is not the case of the farmer
 jo kamjor he, usase chhino
 If there is strong man, money can be snatched away
 uske khilaaf hum
 Weak men go in front of the strong and say, this is my right, you cannot
 vedanta kya he
 What is there in Niamhgiri
 pehle kya hua karti thi
 Jayaram: Was MNC
 pehle jameen se boxite uthaati thi
 Rahul: Whose is this (bauxite)
 niamgiri main kya kah rahe the log
 i went there unhone kaha dekhie
 This is our religion
 ki agar ye pahaad lenaa chaahate hai, to panchayaton se puuchhen
 Were taking it there without asking
 panchayaton se poocha, to bole ki ham dena nahin chaahate
 We do not want half India to cry and half be strong
 jairam ramesh:rahul ji, aapane 10 lakh mahilaon ko mahila bachat samooh main ikattha kiya
 This is not a small job
 hamaara vahaan rajya sarkaar nahin he 25 saal se
 But in 40 districts, about one lakh women savings groups are assembled and connected with banks
 main aapse poochna chahta hum
 Why did you do this ye bilkul chup hai
 Rahul: They say why not talk
 main karnaa nahin chahta kyon nahin karata
 There are two types of people
 ek jo kaam karata he, doosraa baat karata he
 i told my father
 aap puraa din kaam karte ho
 Why do not you speak
 unhone kaha, kaam bolegaa
 And today, yesterday i gave a speech
 aapke jeb main phone he, ye mobile phone, ye unke kaam ne aapaki jeb main daalaa
 The most senior BJP leader, Vajpayee ji, Advani ji
 unke top netaaon ne us samay kya tha
 Named Computer Boy
 majaak udaaya or bhaashan die ki computer se kya hoga, barbaad ho jayega, naukariyaan khatm ho jaaengi or phir 15 saal baad, jab kaam karne vaala chalaa gaya
 Those people stood up and Pramod Mahajan ji said that we did computer work
 dekhie dekhie, sardaar patel ko uthaa liya
 In the coming times, we will say that the right to food, MNREGA, was also our thinking main iske bare main baat kam karata hum
 You said, i have done a great job
 mujhe mahilaon se seekhney ko mila
 i want a time in my life when half of the women are in the Lok Sabha and the legislative assemblies

 com / ri2bow5tbf— Riteish Deshmukh (@riteishd)december 16, 2019 BJP has said that the affidavit filed by the CBI Director makes it clear that Law Minister Ashwani Kumar tampered with the report
 bijepi ne pradhanmantri or koyala mantri ke istife kii maang karte hue kaha ki ghotaale kii nishpaksh jaanch ko prabhavit karne kii koshish kii gai or yah jaananaa behad jaruri he ki sibiai kii asli states report kya thi
 In its report to the court last month, the CBI had said that the government had not properly looked at the financial and other records of the companies, due to which the government lost its license distribution
 sarkaar kii mushkilen isliye bhi hai, kyonki jis samay kaa yah maamla he us dauraan koyala mantralay kaa prabhaar khud pradhanmantri ke paas tha

 Apart from being the chief minister of bjp-ruled states, there is another great similarity between Anandiben Patel, Devendra Fadnavis, Manohar Lal Khattar, Vasundhara Raje, Shivraj Singh Chauhan and Raman Singh
 ye sabhi milakar good gavarnence or pragatigami raajnneeti kii us charchaa ko patari se utaarne main ab sakriy bhoomika nibhaane lage hai jo modi sarkaar ke satta main aane ke baad shuru hui thi
 Actually, the states should have been the architect of the new governance, they are suddenly becoming the weakest link in the Modi model
 congress apane das saal ke taaja shashan main rajyon se jis samanvay ke liye buree tarah tarasati rahi, vah bijepi ko yun hi mil gaya
 This happened for the first time decades later, when 11 states have a coalition government that is running the government with a majority at the center
 baat keval rajnatik samanvay kii hi nahin he, vikaas kii sambhaavnaaon ke paimaane par bhi modi ke paas shaayad sabase acchhee team he
 Mackenzie, in his study, has assessed the states' developmental capabilities, basing the previous statistics of development in the states and existing facilities
 desh ke 12 rajya (dilli, chandigarh, goa, puducheri, gujarat, haryana, himachal, kerala, punjab, maharashtra, tamilnadu, utraakhand) desh kaa 50 fisadi jidipi sambhalate hai, jinamein desh ke 58 fisadi upabhokta basate hai
 In five of these 12 states, the government of BJP and allies is handling about 25 percent of the country's GDP
 tej sambhaavnaaon ke agle paaydaan par aane vaale saat rajyon (andhra pradesh, karnataka, rajasthan, chhattisgarh, jammu-kashmir, bengal, orissa) ko shaamil kar liya jaae to 19 main nau bade rajya or desh kaa lagbhag 40 fisad jidipi bijepi va uske sahyogi dalon kii sarkaar ke hawaale he
 mckenzie has further identified 65 urban districts with 40 percent GDP
 inamen bhi ek badi sankhya bijepi ke niyantran vaali sthaneey sarkaron kii he
 Ideally, this should have been the best development board
 kam se kam in rajyon, udyog cluster or shahari jilon ke sahare to pradhanmantri narendra modi ke mahatvakankshi abhiyaan jameen par utarane chahie the, lekin pichley 15 maheenon main in rajyon good gavarnence ke agenda ko bhatakaane main koi kami nahin chodi
 Scam comes out under every chair in Madhya Pradesh
 maharashtra sarkaar ne ghotaalon se shuruyaat kii or pratibandhon ko gavarnence bana liya
 Discussions of development in Haryana have turned into achievements like restrictions and teaching of Gita in schools
 dilachasp he ki rajyon ne bhale hi centre kii nai shuruyaaton ko tavajjo na di ho lekin bade prachaar abhiyaanon main centre ke model ko apnaane main deree nahin kii
 In the Prime Minister's latest meeting with industrialists, it emerged that the campaigns to ease the business were dying on the threshold of the states
 audyogic va kaarobaari manzooriyon ko aasaan va ekamusth banane kaa abhiyaan pichad gaya he
 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had to say that making the business comfortable is an ever-running process whereas the government had a year to lump all clearances while making Make in India
 centre sarkaar ke adhikari ab iske liye kam se kam teen saal kaa samay maang rahe hai to sirf isliye kyonki auron ko to chhodie, bijepi shasit rajyon ne bhi is abhiyaan ko bhav nahin diya
 Not only Make in India, bjp's own states did not listen to the Center to change the Mandi law
 digital india par rajya thande hai
 States such as Adarsh gram and Swachhta Mission do not have the activeness of states other than camera-proof images
 prashasnic sudhaar, rajya ke upakramon kaa vinievesh or paardarshita badhaane vaale faislon kii bajaae rajyon ne sarkari niyantran badhaane or loklubhaavan skiimon ke model chune hai jo niveshkon or yuva aabaadi kii ummiido se kam mail khate hai
 With this year's budget, the Modi government fully entrusted the responsibility of social services like education, health, rural development, city development to the states and limited the center to only resource allocation
 iskaa nateeja he ki 15 maheene main shiksha, swasthya, khaadya suraksha jaise kshetron main sabase bada shunya dikh rahaa he
 The Center wants to play an indirect role in social services while the states lack policy capabilities rather than resources
 isliye shiksha, sehat, gramin vikaas main kshamtaaon kaa vikaas or vistaar pichad gaya he
 The BJP leaders also believe that leaving the state completely to the needs of education and health is going to cause political damage
 modi ke satta main aane se pehle or baad main bani rajya sarkarein apekshaaon kii kasuti par kamjor pad rahi hai, jabaki kuch bade rajya yaa to centre se rishton main haashie par hai yaa phir chunaav kii taiyaari shuru kar rahe hai
 There are about ten major states across the country whose governments have time, resources and possibilities and most of them belong to the BJP and its allies
 “india” brands or abhiyaanon ko nateezon se sajaane kaa daaromadar inhen par he lekin kism-kism ke pratibandhon or ahm faislon kii divaani in sarkaron ne vikaas ko to chhodie, vikaas ke sakaaratmak sanvaadon ko bhi dhwast karnaa shuru kar diya he
 There is no end to electoral politics
 2016 kaa chunaav kaarykram is saal se zyada bada he
 Unlike the electoral politics, the Prime Minister will have to fit his model of governance afresh and tie the states with big and concrete plans or whatever the outcome of the Bihar elections, but if the state governments miss out, then investment, development and employment strategies Will turn upside down badly
 gujarat ke kuccha jile main arab sagar ke kori creek ilaake se ek nauka main savaar saat pakistani nagarikon ko giraftaar kiya gaya he
 BSF Inspector General AK Sinha said that our troops intercepted a boat which crossed the Indian waters near Corey Creek yesterday
 pot main saat log savaar the, jinhen giraftaar kar liya gaya he or sthaneey police ko saunpa ja rahaa he
 He said that during preliminary investigation these people said that they had come from Karachi and had come here for fishing purpose
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne buudhvaar ko machuaaron ke saath baithak main vaada kiya ki sarkaar banane par unki samasyaon ke samaadhaan ke liye alag mantralay banaaenge
 On February 28, Korahul Gandhi held a meeting with fishermen from various states

 Before the Gujarat Assembly elections, Congress President Rahul Gandhi had promised to form a separate ministry in a meeting with fishermen from the coastal areas
