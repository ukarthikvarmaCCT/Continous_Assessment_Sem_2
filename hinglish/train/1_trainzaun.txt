 bijepi ke samarthan se jammu-kashmir main sarkaar chalaa chukin mahabuuba mufti ne somvaar ko twit kar kaha ki is raajnneetik masale ke raajnneetik samaadhaan kii jarurat he
 All parties including Pakistan should be involved in this
 purv mukhyamantri ne kaha ki 1947 se hi sarkarein kashmir ko suraksha ke chashme se dekhati rahi hai
 It is ridiculous to expect the new home minister Amit Shah for quick fixes through the use of force
 Since 1947, Kashmir’s been looked through the prism of security by successive governments
 It's a political problem that needs a political redressal by involving all stakeholders inc Pak
 Expecting a quick fix through brute force by newly appointed HM is ridiculously naive— Mehbooba Mufti (@mehboobamufti)june 3, 2019gauratlab he ki prachand janadesh ke saath ek baar phir satta main ai modi sarkaar ne loksabhaa chunaav prachaar ke dauraan rajya main dhara 370 or anuchhed 35 a samaapt karne kaa vaada kiya tha
 It was also mentioned in the bjp's resolution letter
 party ke adhyaksh amit shah ko nai sarkaar main rajnath singh kii jagah grih mantri banaae jane ke baad unase kashmir ke halaat se kadai se nipatane kii ummid jataai ja rahi he
 Hurriyat also expressed hope before Mehbooba Mufti, Hurriyat Conference President Mirwaiz Umar Farooq also hoped on Friday that the new NDA government would seriously consider the offer of talks by Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan

 The Mirwaiz said these words while giving prayers (sermons) after prayers in Jama Masjid on the last Friday of Ramadan, 'jumat-ul-vida'
 shah se sakhti kii ummidakshmir ghati ke halaat sarkaar ke liye hameshaa chintajanak rahe hai
 Eliminate the time of the horrific flood a few years ago in which the Kashmiris were not tired of praising the army personnel who were helping, but now the news of stone pelting from Kashmir is common
 paak ke samarthan main narebaaji, sena par patharbaji karne waalon se sakhti se nipatane kii maang hameshaa hoti rahi he
 Now that PM Modi has given Amit Shah of strict image to the Home Ministry, people are hopeful that he will deal with it strictly
 rajdhani main 20 saal kii ek ladki ne saahas kaa parichay dikhaate hue chhedhkhani karne vaale ladke ko police ke hawaale kar diya
 a senior police officer said that the incident took place around 7 pm on Tuesday
 12veen kaksha kii chaatra chanakyapuri ke nehru park main apni maa ke saath tahal rahi thi
 During that time Manjeet, a 22-year-old man, started molesting her
 ladki ne pehle ansuna kiya lekin jab yuvak nahin mana, to ladki ne police or apane parijanon ko suchit kar diya
 Knowing the arrival of the police, Manjeet tried to escape, but the girl chased and caught him
 usee samay uske parijan bhi pahunch gayi
 When the police arrived, Manjeet was handed over to the police
 beete saal 18 june ko bijepi ke tamaam 'hukmran' gajiabad main ikattha hue the
 Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath was also present at the meeting along with a total of 14 mps and 59 mlas, including ministers of the Center and the state
 sabhi ke maathe par shikan thi
 The reason for this was the defeat in successive by-elections
 ek ke baad ek karke bijepi phulpur, gorakhpur, kairana or nurpur kaa chunaav haar chuki thi
 After taking over power, the question of Yogi Adityanath's leadership ability was constantly being questioned
 gorakhpur main mili maat se sawaal hone lage the ki kya yogi kii hindutv or kattarwadi chhavi nuksaan pahunchaa rahe hai? sampradayik dhruvikaran se party ko nuksaan pahunch rahaa he? yogi kii kattar hindutv vaali chhavi kathghare main aa gai thi
 It was said that if the performance in the by-elections was held under the leadership of Yogi, if this trend continued in the 2019 elections, then the entirety of it would be borne by them
 'ali bajrang bali' or 'haraa virus'2019 ke aam chunaav se thik pehle sapa, basapa ko 'gathbandhan' rupi jeet kaa nayaa formula milte dekh yogi ne fouran apane chir-parichit andaaj main hindutv kii dhar or tej kar di
 Firebrand yogis became even more furious than before
 'ali bajrang bali' or 'haraa virus' jaise bayaan isi kii baangi hai
 Now, before the 2019 result, exit polls show that the people of UP like this style of Yogi
 kya kahata he agsit polagathabandhan formula ke tahat pradesh kii 80 main se basapa 38, sapa 37 or RLD ne teen siton par chunaav ladaa
 Political pundits also started to believe that this time the BJP is going to suffer the most in UP
 lekin agsit pole in sabase alag kahani bayaan kar rahe hai
 In the exit poll of Aaj tak-axis My India, out of 80 Lok Sabha seats in the state, BJP alliance is seen getting 62-68 seats, SP-BSP-RLD alliance 10 to 16 seats and Congress getting 1 to 2 seats
 Huh
 23 may ko agar agsit pole sahi sabit hue to modi magic ke saath-saath iskaa shrey brands yogi ko bhi dena hoga
 This time Yogi has proved his leadership ability
 agsit pole jaise hi nattejey aae to aane vaale vakt main yogi kaa kad or badhanaa tay he
 The manner in which Prime Minister Narendra Modi, during election campaigning, used nationalism as an election campaign, referring to the air strike, describing the valor of the army, set a new narrative
 isse ek kadam or aage badhate hue yogi ne prakhar hindutv or rashtrawaad kaa puure prachaar ke dauraan jamkar istemaal kiya
 With the new attitude, Yogi has emerged as a poster boy of Hindutva
 ye yogi kaa jaadu hi tha ki duusare rajyon main bhi kaaphi log unhen sunne ke liye pahunch rahe the
 At the same time, Akhilesh Yadav had fewer rallies in the state than Yogi
 kattar hindutv vaali chhavi ko party ne bhunaayani:andeh yogi bijepi main piem modi ke baad lokapriyata ke maamle main agrani netaaon main shumaar hai
 Seeing his staunch Hindutva image, the BJP had completely thrown him into the election campaign this time
 yogi ne sirf reliyaan or road sho hi nahin kiye, balki soshal media main bhi ve kaaphi mukhar rahe
 Throughout the campaign, Yogi continued to target the opposition in his firebrand style
 loksabhaa chunaav se pehle jin rajyon main vidhansabha chunaav the, vahaan bhi yogi ne kai reliyaan kin
 a total of 150 election rallies - meetings in 9 states - Yogi began campaigning for the Lok Sabha with a Vijay Sankalp rally in Saharanpur on 24 April
 iske baad yogi bina ruke-thake lagaataar reliyaan karte rahe
 Yogi was in great demand outside Uttar Pradesh
 party ke aadesh par yogi ne lagbhag sabhi bade rajyon main reliyaan or road sho kiye
 Between April 24 and May 17, Yogi held around 150 rallies and election meetings in 9 states
 air strike kaa reliyon main kiya zikrayogi adityanath ne jab se soobe kii kaman sanbhali he, tabhi se hindutv or rashtrawaad unke pramukh agenda main rahaa he
 As soon as Yogi came, he tightened the screws on the slotter house and announced that there would be no restriction on the journey of Kavad
 kaanvadiyon par phool bhi barasaaye gaye
 When the elections came, Yogi gave a big edge to the Hindutva agenda
 air strike kaa reliyon main zikr kar yogi ne rashtrawaad ko apana pramukh hathiyaar banaaya
 Defeated coalition, Priyanka's might is also useless, this time bjp's path to UP was not easy
 pichhali baar bijepi ne 71 or sahyogi apana dal ne do siten jiti thim
 But this time, the 24-year-old rivalry between the SP and the BSP also ended in the fight for survival
 do dhruv sareekhee partiyon ne 'dosti' kar lee
 This further increased the responsibility of Yogi Adityanath, which he performed well
 congress kii baat karen to is party ko sanjivani dene ke liye priyanka gandhi ko utaara gaya
 It felt that UP got out of the hands of BJP this time, but Yogi also thwarted it
 priyanka bhi yahaan koi parakram nahin dikhaa sakin
 Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati were more than Rahul Gandhi on the target of Yogi in the entire campaign 'bua-babua' more targeted than Rahul
 buaa-babua par unhone kai dafe chutki lee
 He said that these 'friends' will become 'enemies' after 23 May
 sapa-basapa ko unhone tamaam upamaaon se vibhooshit bhi kiya
 In Bundelkhand, Yogi also recited Kabir's couplet 'liar ke liar liye, dunna bandha saneh' while expressing their friendship
 72 ghante ke bain main bhi diya sandeshdhuandhar prachaar ke dauraan kai baar unhone maryaada kii seemaa bhi langhi, jiskaa unhen khamiyaja bhugatna padaa
 The Election Commission banned him for three days from 16 April
 lekin, yogi ne in 72 ghanton kaa bhi bharpoor upyog karte hue puja-paath kar matadaataaon ko prakarantar sandesh diya
 On the first day, Yogi arrived to visit Hanuman Setu temple in Lucknow, then saw Ramlala in Ayodhya the next day
 tisare din yogi banaras pahunch gaye or vahaan kaashi vishwanath ke darshan kiye
 Was the talk made out of trouble? During the election campaign, Yogi made many such statements, which gave opportunity to the opponents
 5 april ko yogi ne muslim lig ko haraa virus kaha to 9 april ko meerut main kaha ki congress, espi, bispi ko ali par vishwaas he to hamen bhi bajrang bali par vishwaas he
 Before becoming Chief Minister, another statement of Yogi had been in the limelight, which shows his staunch image
 yogi ne kaha tha ki agar ve ek hindu ladki kaa dharm parivartan karenge to ham unki 100 muslim ladakiyon kaa dharm parivartan karenge
 Yogi's statement received a lot of criticism, but this image of Yogi gave him a lot of political advantage
 vidhasabha chunaavon main bhi thi demandam chunaav se thik pehle madhya pradesh, rajasthan, telugana or chhattisgarh ke vidhansabha chunaav main bhi yogi bijepi ke star campaner rahe hai
 Yogi Adityanath alone held 70 meetings in four of the five states
 yogi ne sabase zyada 26 chunavi sabhaayen rajasthan main kin
 At the same time, he held 19 meetings in Chhattisgarh
 madhya pradesh main unhone 17 chunavi sabhaaon ko sambodhit kiya
 At the same time, CM Yogi had 8 meetings in Telangana
 isse pehle yogi ne karnataka or gujarat vidhansabha chunaav main bhi kai sabhaayen kin
 According to the data, BJP won 26 of the 35 seats in Gujarat where Yogi held meetings

 input: bhashaa The ongoing controversy over the Sabarimala temple is not taking the name of a halt
 mandir ke kapaat khulne ke saath hi vahaan suraksha behad sakht kar di gai he
 There was a clash after the opening of the doors of the temple in the early hours of Tuesday
 isamen ek 52 saal kii mahila ghayal ho gai
 Apart from this, some media persons are also reported to have been injured
 mandir somvaar shaam paanch baje kholaa gaya tha
 a few days before the opening of the temple, very strict security arrangements were made there
 2300 javaanon ko mandir main tainaat kiya gaya he
 Despite this, there was a clash today

 During this time the woman was injured
 abhootpurv suraksha vyavastha ke bich do divasiy vishesh puja ke liye teen hafte main duusari baar bhagwaan ayappa mandir ke daravaaje somvaar ko yahaan khole gaye the
 It was already feared that those protesting the order of the Supreme Court regarding the entry of women of all age groups into the temple may protest here
 haalanki, police ne kaha ki mandir main 10 se 50 varsh aayu varg kii koi ladki yaa mahila najar nahin ai, lekin 30 saal kii ek mahila apane pati or do bacchon ke saath pamba sthit aadhaar shivi pahunchi he
 However, the woman named Anju, who hails from Cherthala in Alappuzha district, told the police that she did not want to come to the temple but came under pressure from her husband Abhilash
 police ne daawa kiya ki mahila ke pati kii jid he ki use apane parivaar ke saath puja-archana karne di jaae
 The Kerala Police is seen to be making contradictory statements on this issue
 ek sthaneey police adhikari ne daawa kiya ki mahila ne police suraksha kii maang kii thi jabaki police adheekshak rahul aar nair kaa kahana he ki mahila ne koi suraksha nahin maangi
 When the woman's husband continued with his stand, the police asked his relatives to come to Pamba for the final decision
 raat 10 baje mandir ke dwaar band hone ke samay anju or uskaa parivaar police niyantran kaksh main intjaar kar rahe the

 Meanwhile, the Kerala High Court on Monday said that devotees should not be harassed in the name of implementing the decision of the Supreme Court
 kya tha supreme court kaa faisla?bataa den ki supreme court ne 10 se 50 saal kii mahilaon ko mandir main pravesh se rokane kii sadiyon puraani parampara ko galat bataate hue use khatm kar diya tha or sabhi ayuvarg kii mahilaon ko pravesh karne kii ijaajat di thi

 It is a well-known measure of prosperity in villages
 chaar saal kii giravat ke baad, pichley saal ke kuch maheenon ke dauraan gramin mazdooree badhati dikhi thi lekin vetal phir daal par tang gaya he
 Wait! This decline is not normal because
 
 
 -pichley saal monsoon behatar rahaa or record upaj bhi
 So far this year, even though the clouds are kind - the rise in support prices has not been so bad
 -2014 se ab tak andhra pradesh, telugana, uttar pradesh, maharashtra, punjab, rajasthan, karnataka main kisaanon ke karj maaf kiye gaye yaa kiye ja rahe hai
 - In the last one year, the Center and States have put a record (maximum number of resources) in villages
 -or sasta aayaat rokane ke liye gehun, chini, khaadya tel ke aayaat par custom duty (haal main chini par 100 fisadi, chane par 50 fisadi, gehun par 30 fisadi) badhaai gai
 Still the revenue is falling in the villages! The loss of income is not only scary for the voters, hundreds of companies making mobiles, bikes, soaps, oils, chemicals, medicine, textiles, cement are also sweating on the village market
 Huh
 sarkaar ko uske hisse kii saraahna milani chahie ki usne pichley chaar saal main anya sarkaron kii tarj par kheti main jagah-jagah aag bujhane kii bharsak koshish kii he
 These efforts include the promise of raising the support price to the maximum extent
 kisaanon kii aay doguni karne ke iraade ke neeche nitiyon kii neenv najar nahin ai lekin yah maanane main harj nahin ki sarkaar gaanvon main ghatati aay kii hakeekat se gaffil nahin he
 In fact, there has been a paradigm shift in the rural economy in the last two years in the populous rural economy
 badalon kii berukhi kheti ko todatii he lekin achche megh se kamai nahin ugti
 The fertilizer and water of the government's help also goes waste

 To understand this, we have to knock on the factories of the cities which are mostly labor-intensive and have a large share in the Indian economy
 2005 se 2012 ke bich badi sankhya main gaanvon se log shaharon main aae the jab bhawan nirmaan, transport jaise kaarobaar fal-phool rahe the
 This was the period when the villages saw the fastest increase in earnings
 gramin aay main giravat kaa taaja adhyay, shaharon main shram aadhaarit udyogon main mandi kii vandana se prarambh hota he
 Leather, handicrafts, sporting goods, footwear, gems and jewelery, wood, paper industries were hit by demonetisation and deep recession after GST
 ye udyeg paaramparik rup se shramikon par aadhaarit hai
 The stars of construction have been bad since 2014
 shuruaati aankade hamen is akalan kii taraf dhakelte hai ki shahari mandi, gaanvon kii sabase badi musiibat he
 In the last two years there has been a massive migration of workers from cities to villages
 gaanv main ab kaam kam or maangane vaale haath zyada hai to mazdooree kaise badhegi? vahaan jabardast gussa yun hi nahin khadbada rahaa he
 a large part of the village economy is arguably now dependent on cities, so a record increase in GDP (fourth quarter of 2017-18) will not make sense
 gaanvon ko apni khushhaali waapas paane ke liye shaharon kii patari par baithkar lanbaa intjaar karnaa hoga
 Now the good days of the villages depend on the end of the recession from the cities
 shahar main dhandha-rojgaar badhegaa tab gaanv main baraat chadhegi
 It may take a long time for the city to open the house of employment amid oil inflation, high interest rates and weak rupee
 If despite the good harvest, debt waiver and government efforts, the urban recession has wrapped up the village, then sit back , Because this vicissitudes can change the politics of politics

 ) bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar or dilli ke siem arvind kejariwal ke manch saajha karne se nae raajnneetik samikarnon kii sugabugahat shuru ho gai hai
 With this friendship raising voices against Kejriwal, Lalu is also said to be unhappy with Nitish
 lagata he ki kejariwal bhi ab 'ekala chalo' kii niti se ukta gaye hai
 In political terms, walking together is not a bad deal for both leaders
 nitish kii najar bihar chunaav par he to kejariwal bhavishya ke akaash par nigahen jamaayen baithe hai
 Know what benefits Nitish and Kejriwal can get from this friendship: 1
 kejariwal kii chhavi kaa nitish ko phydarvind kejariwal vivaadon se ghire rahete hai, lekin unki chhavi eemaandaar netaa kii he
 His successful journey from the Anna movement to the formation of a government with a thumping majority is astonishing
 aise main nitish unhen apane saath dikhaakar saaf-suthri-eemaandaar raajnneeti ko pasand karne vaale bihari votaron ko aakarshith karnaa chahenge
 Kejriwal's political examination is yet to take place, but he has his own fan base in most states of the country, which is full of educated youth
 nitish iskaa phayda uthaanaa chahenge
 Kejriwal has a strong hold in the lower economic class and youth in Delhi
 kejariwal ke saath dikhne kaa jaraa bhi phayda nitish ko miltaa he, to vah nishchit hi khush honge
 2
 modi virdohi saajha morche main kejariwal kii aupchaarik entridesh main congress kii haalat patali he or modi virdohi morcha ek janpriya netaa ke abhaav se jujh rahaa he
 By standing with Nitish, Kejriwal is making a dent in that front and making his presence known
 aane vaali raajnneeti main tisare morche ke netaa ke taur par bhi kai raajnneetik jaankaar unki sambhaavnaaen khaarij nahin karte
 3
 dilli ko milegaa dostnitish kumaar ne apane kaarykaal main dilli sarkaar kii kai baar madad kii he or vah kejariwal kii dosti ke liye zyada lalayit najar aate hai
 You will remember that Nitish accepted sending the Bihar cadre officer to Delhi's Anti Corruption Bureau
 nitish jab bhi dilli aate hai to kejariwal se mili bagaiyr nahin lautate
 Both have met five times in the last two months
 aise main agar nitish bihar main dobaaraa siem kii kursi sambhalate hai to dilli ko desh main sambhavat: iklauti 'mitra sarkaar' milegi, jo gaahe-bagaahe prashasnic or anya masalon par madad kar sakati he

 ek-duusare ke muddon kaa karenge samarthanapako yaad hoga ki pichley kuch maheenon main dilli ke masalon par nitish kumaar lagaataar pratikriya dete rahe hai
 He has also supported the Kejriwal government's demand for full statehood status to Delhi
 alji-kejariwal vivaad par bhi unhone kaha tha ki yah kisi sarkaar he ki mukhyamantri adhikariyon kaa transfar nahin kar saktaa, phir bhi sari jimmedaari usee kii he
 If Nitish wins, it is likely that in the coming times he will openly support Kejriwal and some of his issues
 donon kii yah sashart or santulit jugalbandi bijepi ke liye sukhad to nahin hi hogi

 modi ke khilaaf ek safal chehroarvind kejariwal narendra modi ke khilaaf vijay ke safal pratinidhi hai
 BJP nominated Kiran Bedi as CM candidate in the last Delhi assembly, but votes were sought in Modi's name only
 pradhanmantri ne dilli main chaar badi reliyaan kin
 Big hoardings had their pictures placed on them
 iske baavjood bijepi buree tarah chunaav haar gai
 Kejriwal's AAP created history by winning 67 out of 70 seats and it became common in the country that Kejriwal stopped Modi's chariot
 bihar main bhi muqabla modi banaam nitish kaa he
 In such a situation, Nitish has played a strong political stance on a psychological level by bringing a person who has won over Modi
 yaad kiijie, haal hi main kejariwal ke saath dilli main manch saajha karte hue nitish ne pradhanmantri kii ek line doharaai thi, 'jo desh kaa mood he, vahi dilli kaa mood he', or iske aage yah joda, 'jo dilli kaa mood he, vahi bihar kaa mood he

 Hundreds of Delhi traders on Thursday strongly criticized the Monitoring Committee at a dharna organized by the Confederation of All India Traders (CAT) at Jantar Mantar, making frequent ceilings of shops in Delhi a major issue
 unhone kaha ki monitering cameti ke aloktantric evam adiyal ravaiye ke kaaran dilli main chaaron taraf ceiling kaa kahar he or sahi hone ke baavjood bhi abhi tak ek bhi vyapaarik pratishthan kii sil khuli nahin he
 Traders said that a major crisis of livelihood has arisen in front of lakhs of people in Delhi, the capital of the country, because thousands of shops in Delhi have been closed for the last one year due to sealing
 cat ne sarkaar se maang kii he ki dilli main ceiling ko rokane ke ab thos kadam uthaae jaaen or sarkaar yaa to sansad ke chaalu satr main is mudde par bill laae athwa sansad satr ke turant baad ek adhyadesh laae jisamen ek cat of date ghoshit kii jaae
 Whatever was the situation in Delhi till that cut off date should be maintained
 bill athwa adhyadesh main ceiling se band hui dukaanon kii sil bhi turant kholi jane kaa praavdhaan ho
 CAT has also demanded from the government that in view of the dictatorial attitude of the Monitoring Committee, the Government should demand the Supreme Court to dissolve the Monitoring Committee
 dharne main shaamil vyapaariyon ne ceiling or monitering cameti ke khilaaf joardaar naare lagaae or monitering cameti ke ek putale kaa dahan bhi kiya
 There are about 7 lakh traders in Delhi who employ about 25 lakh people
 is myne main ceiling dilli ke vyapaariyon ke liye kisi bhi daanav se kam nahin he
 cat's National General Secretary Praveen Khandelwal said that sealing in Delhi is a big issue due to the merchants and their employees being connected with the livelihood
 disambar 2017 se lekar ab tak gat ek varsh main dilli main hajaaron dukaane sil ho gai hai jinaki koi sunwaayee nahin he vahin duusari ore anya hajaaron dukaanon par ceiling kii talwaar lataki hui he
 The case has been going on for a long time in the Supreme Court and no decision is being taken
 court main vyapaariyon kaa paksh rakhaa hi nahin ja rahaa
 Khandelwal clearly said that if someone has taken possession of government land, then action should be taken against it, traders will have no objection
 lekin dashakon se vyapaar kar rahe vyapaariyon kii dukaanon ko bina koi notice or paryaapt samay die sil karnaa behad aloktantric he
 The Municipal Corporation of Delhi Act 1957, which has been passed by the Parliament, is being blown openly
 cat ke dilli pradesh adhyaksh susheel goyal ne maang kii ki jin marketon ko shift karnaa he unhen shift karne vaale sthaan par sari dhanchaagat suvidhaayen pehle uplabdh karai jaaen

 It is said that a photo is worth a thousand words! It seems that if someone has understood this saying very well, then they are people who are running fake news
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne ravivaar ko purvi uttar pradesh main teen jagahon par raily kii, jisamen mirzapur bhi shaamil he
 a picture of the Mirzapur rally is being widely viral on social media, showing that Muslim women are sitting in the front row shouting slogans for Modi
 soshal media par bijepi ke hajaaron samarthak is photo ke dam par yah daawa kar rahe hai ki modi kii lokapriyata ab muslim mahilaon ke bhi sar chadhakar bol rahi he
 It is not hidden from anyone that BJP is continuously trying to divide the minority votebank by winning the hearts of Muslim women
 maamla chaahe sharia adaalaton kaa ho, halaala kaa yaa phir teen talaak kaa
 BJP is constantly trying to give the message that it is the only party that is concerned about the interests of Muslim women
 purvi uttar pradesh ke daure main apane bhaashan main pradhanmantri narendra modi ne azamgarh main sawaal bhi uthaaya tha ki kya muslimon ke party hone kaa daawa karne vaali congress kya sirfmuslim mardonki hi party he? jis photo ke dam par mirzapur ke raily main muslim mahilaon kaa samarthan dikhaane kii koshish kii gai he hamane uskaa viral test karne kaa faisla kiya
 In the photo, three women wearing burqas are seen chanting slogans with a BJP sign on their throats
 photo ko bahut dhyaan se dekhne par pataa chalata he ki us main bain taraf bijepi kaa ek binar bhi dikh rahaa he
 But with the lotus mark in it, the word BJP is not written in Hindi, English or Urdu, but in some other language
 uttar pradesh kii raily main BJP kaa naam hindi angreji yaa urdu main nahin likhakar kisi or bhashaa main likhaa jaae isaki sambhaavna bahut kam he
 That's why we started searching for this photo
 yah photo kahaan se ai kis baat kii khoj karte hue hamen ek aisi tasviir mili jisko dekhakar yah saaf he ki isi tasviir se katkar sirf muslim mahilaon kii ki bhagidaari dikhaane vaala photo ko banaaya gaya he
 Seeing this big photo, it becomes clear that apart from the three women wearing the burqa, other people are also sitting in this rally, but by cropping the photo for the specific purpose, such a picture has been taken out which reveals only the Muslim women
 yah photo darasal karnataka chunaav ke dauranmodi kii ek relika he jise 9 may ko liya gaya tha
 The poster reads "BJP" in Kannada language
 karnataka vidhansabha chunaav prachaar ke dauraan modi ne 9 may ko bangarpet, chikmagalore or belgavi bhi main teen sabhaayen kii thim
 Modi himself then shared several pictures from his Twitter, including one
 uske baad kai duusare logon ne bhi ise share kiya tha
 During the Karnataka elections, the old photo tweeted by Modi himself is being spread by misleading the UP for political purposes
 photo asli he or raily bhi modi kii hi he
 But this is not Uttar Pradesh but Karnataka and the photo is old

 Congress general secretary Digvijay Singh on Monday hit back at Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi
 unhone kaha he ki modi pehle dharmanirpekshata kii paribhaasha to bataaen
 In fact, Modi said in Pune on Sunday that when the Congress comes into crisis, it hides in the burqa of secularism
 modi ke isi bayaan ko aade haathon lete hue digvijay ne kaha ki sangh or bijepi kaa secularism alag he
 They believe that there should be one country, one religion and one culture
 digvijay ne kaha, 'modi kii najar main secularism kya he? modi kii secularism kii paribhaasha kya he? modi dharmanirpekshata ke bare main kya kehete hai, ham pehle wo sunanaa chahenge
 Because the definition of Advani and that of the bjp-sangh is different
 ve ek dharm, ek samskruti or ek raashtra ko maanate hai
 With this, Digvijay also told journalists not to ask questions about Modi
 unhone kaha, 'aap log mujhase modi ji ke bare main zyada prashn naa puuchhen, kyonki main unako tarjeeh nahin dena chahta
 'significantly, at the Pune rally on Sunday, Modi said that when the Congress comes into crisis, it hides in the burqa of secularism
 unhone kaha tha, 'jaraa gaur se dekhie
 Whenever the Congress faces challenges, be it corruption, inflation, Supreme Court directives, a minister going to jail, raping girls or an insecurity, they do not respond to the people
 jab bhi sankat paidaa hota he, ve dharmanirpekshata kaa 'burka' pahan lete hai or bunker main chup jate hai
 Earlier, he had said in an interview to Reuters on Friday that secularism for him was 'india first'
 modi ke mutabik, 'dharmanirpekshata kii paribhaasha kya he? mere liye dharmanirpekshata kaa matlab 'bharat pehle' he
 My party's principle is, 'let everyone get justice
 tushtikaran kisi ke liye nahin

 Analysts also believe that if the Shiv Sena makes any alliance with the Congress with the intention of teaching a lesson to the BJP, then it will make the same mistake in Maharashtra that Akhilesh Yadav has done in UP
 yahaan mulaayam singh yadav ke us bayaan kaa sahaara liya ja rahaa he jo unhone upi main sapa-congress gathbandhan ke baad diya tha
 Mulayam Singh Yadav told his son and UP CM Akhilesh Yadav that he was making a mistake

 Bjp spokesperson MJ Akbar said to Rahul on Rahul's statement of not giving even a single inch of land, "when the Congress has nothing to say, stray Bachlata is
 ummid he ki baccha bhi balig ho jayega

 "congress is not the only party in the Parliament" On the Congress's warning of not allowing the monsoon session of Parliament to begin in Tuesday in the land bill and some cases of alleged corruption, Akbar said, "congress is not the only party in Parliament, more parties Huh

 com / chunkmztfz buudhvaar ko nai dilli ke 11, ashok road sthit bijepi mukhyalay par aam aadmi party or bhartiya janata party ke bich hinsak muthbhed hui
 There were also reports of violent clashes between BJP and AAP workers from Lucknow and some other parts of Uttar Pradesh
 der raat hote-hote donon hi party ke netaaon ne apane kaaryakartaaon se apil kii ki ve shanti banaae rakhen
 The new type of politics of the Aam Aadmi Party is presenting a big challenge for the established players of this region
 dilli vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi sabase badi party ke rup main ubhari, magar sarkaar congress ke sahyog se arvind kejariwal kii party ne banaai
 This new party, which made its place in Delhi politics due to dharna and agitation, made a dent in the traditional pro-bjp middle class and poor and Dalit votes of the Congress
 badi sankhya main sarkari karmchaariyon ne bhi is party ko vot die
 In the 49-day government, while Kejriwal made swift decisions in the public interest, his own and the attitude of some ministers made the image of the government such that they are not serious about running the government
 vishleshkon kaa maananaa he ki aam aadmi party kii praathamikta main loksabhaa chunaav hai, isiilie jab kejariwal ko laga ki dilli main ek aadhi-adhuri sarkaar bana kar vah yahaan bandha gaye hai, to unhone janalokapal ke naam par apni sarkaar ko qurbaan kar diya
 Since then, Kejriwal has been constantly clarifying his agenda for the Lok Sabha elections
 unka hamalaa udyogpati mukesh ambani par he or unka naam lekar vah lagaataar congress or bijepi par hamalaa kar rahe hai
 Kejriwal has said hundreds of times that Rahul Gandhi and Narendra Modi have met Mukesh Ambani
 lekin ab dhire-dhire unka hamalaa rahul par kam or narendra modi par zyada hota ja rahaa he
 It was only during Kejriwal's roadshow in UP that his party indicated that if Narendra Modi contested from Benaras, Kejriwal could contest against him
 kabhi kejariwal desh main modi kii hawa hone kii baat kehete hai, to kabhi kehete hai ki yah hawa tivi channlawaalon ne banaai he
 In Kanpur, he announced that he would visit there to know the reality of Gujarat's development
 isi dauraan unhen kathith taur par hiraasat main liye jane kii pratikriya main aam aadmi party ke kaaryakartaon ne dilli samet kai jagahon par bijepi daftaron par hinsak pradarshan kiye
 The bjp's counter-response was equally sharp and violent
 party ne eent kaa jawaab pathar se diya
 In Lucknow, the workers of the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha beat the Aam Aadmi Party workers on the street
 darasal, 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav main desh ke un bade shaharon se bijepi kaa safaya ho gaya, jahaan paramparaagat taur par bijepi ko samarthan miltaa rahaa he
 The middle class in these cities gave their support to the UPA and Manmohan Singh to successfully counter the economic crisis
 laalkrishna adwani ke netritv main is madhya varg ne apni aasthaa nahin jataai
 But things have changed in the last five years
 mahangaai, bhrashtachar, girti vikaas dar, badhati berojgaare jaise muddon ne isi madhya varg ke bheetar congress ke khilaaf jabardast gussa paidaa kiya he
 Anna Hazare and the mass movement of India Angry Corruption in Delhi to fight corruption, Jan Lokpal and the Government of India Angstered the government and this led to the birth of the Aam Aadmi Party
 yahi vajah thi ki november-disambar 2013 main jab dilli samet paanch rajyon ke vidhansabha chunaav hue, to bijepi ko inase baari ummiden thim
 These expectations were fulfilled in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan
 magar dilli main aam aadmi party ne uski ummiido par pani pher diya
 The people of Delhi showed anger against the Congress, but the Aam Aadmi Party took more advantage of it than BJP
 bijepi ko dhakka isliye bhi laga, kyonki usne vidhansabha chunaav main apane pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar narendra modi kaa jamkar istemaal kiya tha
 Now that the Lok Sabha elections have been announced, the headache of the Aam Aadmi Party is again troubling the BJP
 yah baat alag he ki abhi tak ke tamaam janamat surveykshan modi ke paksh main desh bhar main baari samarthan kii baat kar rahe hai, lekin media ke ek hisse main arvind kejariwal ko pradhanmantri pad ke daavedaaron main narendra modi or rahul gandhi ke saath dikhaaya ja rahaa he
 Kejriwal is excited by this support in the media
 bijepi ko lag rahaa he ki congress se naaraaz vot dilli kii hi tarah desh ke duusare bade shaharon main bhi aam aadmi party ke paas na chalaa jaae, aise main vot bantane par nattejey prabhavit ho sakate hai
 This happened to the BJP and its ally Shiv Sena in Mumbai in the last Lok Sabha election, where Raj Thackeray's party benefited the Congress by cutting their votes
 chunki kejariwal kii party chunavi khel kii nai khilaadi he, isliye uske pradarshan ke bare main kuch bhi andaja nahin lagaaya ja saktaa he
 However, whatever the outcome, the war on the streets between the two parties on Wednesday is not auspicious for democracy in any way
 vot kii ladaai sadakon par ladanaa us madhya varg ko to katai pasand nahin aayega, jiske voton kii darkaar bijepi or aam aadmi party donon ko he

 ' vahiin rahul ke is raily ko safal banane ke liye congressi kai dinon se jute hai
 The Congress, engaged in making the rally a success, said that Rahul Gandhi will attend a 'public outrage rally' at 9:30 am on Sunday at Ramlila Maidan

 About one and a half lakh to two lakh Congress workers are expected to attend the rally
 oparation bluestar ke 36 saal baad algaavvaadi netaa bhindranvaale kii yaad main ek gurudwara banaaya gaya he
 a man named Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale challenged India's sovereignty in Punjab and made a habitation at the Golden Temple in Amritsar
 june,1984 main sena ne mandir parisar ko aatankwaadiyon se mukt karaane ke liye sainya karrwai kii thi
 Called 'gurdwara Sant Khalsa', this gurudwara is built in the same place in rode-lande village of Baghapurana subdivision in Moga district, where Bhindranwale's ancestral house used to be
 is gurudware ko aam logon ke liye 14 farvari ko khol diya gaya
 Even if it is unknown, it is likely that both the previous SAD-BJP government and then the Congress government have deliberately ignored it because the construction of the memorial has been over a decade
 bhindranvaale ke bhai-bahan or anya parijanon ke varshon pehle rhode-laande gaanv ke pushtaini ghar ko chhodkar kahin or chale jane ke baad yah ghar khandhar main badal gaya tha
 Kanwarpal Singh, spokesperson of Bhindranwale's staunch pro-separatist party Khalsa, says, "even his sons did not approve of living in this village
" ''dilachasp he ki jiske vichaaron ko bharat ne aadhikarik rup se 'algaavvaadi' or 'charampanthi' ghoshit karke pratibandhit kar rakhaa he, us vyakti kii yaad main nirmaan kaary chalata rahaa or virodh kaa koi swar nahin ubhara
 When the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee and the Damdami Taksal together tried to build the Bluestar Memorial in the middle of the Golden Temple complex in 2013, there were vocal voices of protest as to why they were not heard for the memorial
 haalanki kanvarpal jor dekar kehete hai, ''bhindranvaale kaa maamla or '1984' kii ghatana ke baad failaa aatank, donon alag-alag maamle hai
 "not surprising if the governments sitting in Delhi and Chandigarh continue to watch and the schemes of many other monuments that have been running in the minds of the people of Dal Khalsa for years are completed
" dal khalsa gurudaspur ke agavaan gaanv main satvant singh or chandigarh ke baahar maloya gaanv main beant singh kii yaad main smarak banane ko taiyaar he
 *** shivaji ke vanshajon ko chahie apni jati ke liye shiksha or rojgaar main aarakshan
 This demand can change the political equation in the state
 abhi pichley 4 april ko chhatrapati shivaji kii terahavin peedi ke vanshaj sambhaji raaje ne bhaikhla se dakshini mumbai ke aaazaad maidan tak paanch kimi kii padayatra kii or vahaan ek lakh logon ko sambodhit karte hue maraathon ke liye shiksha or rojgaar main aarakshan kii maang kar daali
 This was the first major rally in Mumbai on an important issue that has the potential to change the political equation in the state
 raily ke ant main maratha jati or rajya main maujuud uske sanghathanon ke netaa ke rup main sambhaji kaa aupchaarik 'abhishek' kiya gaya
 Politically powerful and state 11
 2 karod aabaadi main 40 fisadi hissedari kaa daawa karne vaale maraathon ke liye aarakshan jajbaati masalaa he
 The credit of introducing caste-based reservation first in India is attributed to Shahuji Maharaj of this dynasty
 kolhapur ke shahi khandaan ke 42 varshiya vanshaj sambhaji chaahate hai ki sarkaar maraathon ko anya pichhadi jatiyon (obisi) main shaamil kare
 The Marathas have till now been considered as Kshatriyas of the upper caste
 raaje maanate hai ki is kadam se maraathon kii pratishtha ko thes pahonchegi, lekin unka daawa he ki isse lakhon maraathon ko phayda hoga, jo apane bacchon ko acchhee shiksha nahin dilaa pate or sarkari naukariyaan jinhen nahin mil paati hai
 Raje, sitting on a white couch in a palatial guest house in his palace, 125 years old, spread over 200 acres in Kolhapur, says, "I believe in pressure rather than taking a violent path
" ’ khud ko aam aadmi jaisaa dikhaane ke liye unhone halake nile rang kaa kurta or safed pajama pahana hua he
 Three months ago, his weight was 89 kg, which he has diligently reduced by 13 kg so that he can prepare himself for the political battle to come
 maraathon kaa daawa he ki maharashtra kii 11
 They are 40% of the population of 2 crores
 rajya ke kul 350 vidhayakon (vidhansabha or vidhanparishad) main se 200 maratha hai
 They can say that their agenda is very fine - they are not in favor of political reservation because there is already enough Maratha representation in the assembly
 vidhansabha or vidhaan parishad ke kul 350 vidhayakon main se 200 maratha hai
 They are also against reservation on economic grounds as it can be challenged in court
 india today se ve kehete hai, ‘main maraathon ko obisi shrenee main shaamil kiye jane kii maang kar rahaa hum
 We have to think about the benefits of the poor among us, freed from the bliss of our previous shining heritage and the conceit of coming from a superior caste
 ’sambhaji raaje kii samaveshi raajnneeti brahmanon ke khilaaf nafrat kii paaramparik marathi raajnneeti ko bhi badal sakati he
 There is another dominant caste in the Brahmin state, which is 3 of the total population
 5 fisadi he
 Groups like Maratha Seva Sangh and Sambhaji Brigade have been continuously attacking the institutions of Brahmins
 unka aarope rahaa he ki brahman ‘‘logon kaa dimag bhrasht karte hai
 'it is also in this context that the Brahmins introduce two historical Brahmin personalities each time as Shivaji's Guru - Samarth Ramdas Swami and Dadoji Kondadeva
 raaje nafrat kii raajnneeti ke sakht khilaaf hai, ‘mere purvaj chhatrapati shahu maharaj ne pune main brahmanon kii sanstha deccan ajukeshan sosayadi ko sabase zyada daan diya tha
 People have more expectations from them than me
 main duusari jatiyon or dharmon kii aalochana main yakeen nahin rakhata hum
 'raje first came into the limelight when he delivered a 150 kg statue of Shivaji to the fort of Raigarh, the historical capital of the Marathas, six years ago
 jab bhartiya puraatatv surveykshan ne is pratimaa ko vahaan lagaae jane se manaa kiya, to raaje ne phir iske liye rajya sarkaar ko raji kar liya
 He argued that this was where Shivaji used to hold his court
 raaje tabhi se lagaataar rajya kaa daura kar rahe hai or maang uthaa rahe hai ki shivaji ke paanch duusare kilon ko durust kiya jaae
 He clearly says, 'I don't want to be in politics
 lekin kilon kii marammat main meraa man lagata he
 After visiting Vidarbha, Marathwada and northern Maharashtra, he felt that the voice of the Marathas should be raised
 ve kehete hai, ‘vidarbha main khudakushi karne vaale zyaadaatar kisaan garib maratha the
 Marathwada and northern Maharashtra have almost similar conditions
 isamen koi shaq nahin ki vidhansabha main maraathon kaa acha pratinidhitiv he lekin is vajah se unki aarthik or shaikshanik sthiti main dhele bhar kaa bhi sudhaar nahin hua he
 By the way, there is a doubt among the OBC leaders about this move
 maharashtra obisi sanghatana ke upaadhyaksh shravan devare kaa maananaa he ki obisi shrenee main maraathon ko shaamil kiya gaya to obisi aarakshan kaa hissaa bant jayega
 In the words of Devere, 'the Bombay High Court has clearly stated in its four rulings that Marathas cannot be included in the obcs
 ’jati aadhaarit aarakshan ke liye supreme court kii ore se tay kii gai 50 fisadi kii seemaa ke mukaable maharashtra main pehle se hi yah aankada 52 fisadi par he
 Raje's supporters believe that the state will be allowed to raise this limit further, as has happened in Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka
 in do rajyon main aarakshan kii seemaa kramash: 75 or 61 fisadi he
 However, there is litigation as well
 rajya sarkaar ne udyog mantri narayan rane kii adhyakshata main ek cameti banaai he, jo maraathon ko aarakshan ke mudde par charchaa kar rahi he
 If the committee fails to take a 'suitable' decision, the Congress and ncp's traditional vote bank may pose a risk of breach
 maratha aarakshan raily main 4 april ko aaazaad maidan main maujuud gussaye logon ne raaje kii ore se mukhyamantri prithviraj chavaan ke paas jaakar maangon kaa gyaapan dene kii pahal ko khaarij kar diya
 He believed that there is no example of a Chhatrapati (king) ever going to any government and keeping any kind of request
 raaje kehete hai, ‘log chaahate the ki mukhyamantri khud vahaan aaen or meri baat sunen ki main kya kahana chahta hum
 In the event of the Chief Minister not coming there, there was a preparation for the people to march to the assembly
 maine is tarah kii kisi yojana ko manjuuri nahin di
 Ultimately, the laws of democracy must be respected
 ’ UP minister and Samajwadi Party leader Azam Khan has welcomed the decision to return the Sahitya Akademi Award to litterateurs

 Azam said of the litterateurs, 'we want to salute them
 unase kahana chaahate hai ki unki is qurbaani ne desh ke lakhon logon ko jindagi di he
 Azam also targeted the Shiv Sena and said that the party's intentions were not good

 Sachin is such a cricketer of the world who has his fans not only in India but also in countries not playing international cricket
 jahaan tak bharat kii baat he to yahaan ve kai cricket premiyon ke bhagwaan hai

 However, a section of the BJP believed that it would not be right to remove Amit Shah from the post of BJP President at the moment
 khaskar tab jab haryana, jharkhand, maharashtra, pashchim bengal or dilli main agle kuch maheenon main vidhansabha kaa chunaav hona he
 To further improve its position in the Rajya Sabha, BJP needs to do better in the assembly elections as well

 sena main 'van rank van pension' kii lagu karne kii maang ko lekar dilli ke jantar mantar par purv sainikon ke anshan ko 21 din ho chale hai, lekin abhi tak bhukh hadtaal tuutane ke asaar nahin dikh rahe
 Yes, it has happened so much that after meeting Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar on Thursday, these ex-servicemen are hopeful that some way will come out in the next two-four days
 vaise in sainikon ne pehle hi saaf kar diya he ki van rank van pension ko lekar jo sansad main paribhaasha di gai he us par koi samjhauta nahin hoga or jab tak sarkaar dedline kaa elaan nahin karegi, tab tak jantar mantar ke saath deshbhar main pradarshan jari rahegaa
 The comments sena kii ore se 1965 or 1971 main pakistan ke chakke chhudaane vaale captain darshan singh kehete hai ki ye sarkaar ke liye shame kii baat he ki uske sipaahi apni maang ko lekar sadak par hadtaal karne baithe hai, lekin ham kya karen iske sivaay koi chaara bhi nahi he
 However, the government is now looking to end this dharna at the earliest, so that the anti-jawan with the farmer who is becoming his image can be avoided
 sambhaavna yah he ki somvaar yaa mangalvaar ko phir se rakshaamantri kii purv sainikon ke dal se mulaakaat hogi or ve inhen koi thos bharosa de sakenge
 By the way, these soldiers have already made it clear that there will be no agreement on the definition of One Rank One Pension in the Parliament and till the government does not announce the deadline, the protest will continue across the country with Jantar Mantar Will remain tippaniyan Captain Darshan Singh, who rescued Pakistan's sixes in 1965 and 1971 on behalf of the army, says that it is a shame for the government that its soldiers are sitting on a road strike demanding their demand, but what can we do, other than this Is not vaise sarkaar ab is dharne ko jald se jald khatm karne kii firaaq main he, taaki kisaan ke saath jawan virdohi jo uski chhavi ban rahi he usase bachaa ja sake
 It is likely that on Monday or Tuesday, the defense minister will again meet with a group of ex-soldiers and they will be able to give them some solid confidence

 The central government, which has so far been taking a tough stance on the separatist organization in Kashmir, has taken a U-turn
 pakistani netaaon se algaavvaadiyon kii mulaakaat or baatcheet par ab tak roak lagane vaali sarkaar ab ise hari jhandi detii najar aa rahi he
 In a written reply to the Parliament last week, Minister of State for External Affairs VK Singh said, 'jammu and Kashmir is an integral part of India and Kashmir's separatist leaders are also Indian citizens
 iske chalate ve kisi bhi desh ke ripregentative se mulaakaat or baat kar sakate hai
 "no third party role in talks with PAK" In response, VK Singh has also made it clear that no third party will be brought into india-pakistan talks
 unhone kaha, 'bharat ab tak is baat par adig rahaa he ki pakistan se baatcheet main third party kaa role nahin hoga
 As stated in the Simla Agreement and the declaration in Lahore
 'hurriyat kii vajah se radd hui thi vaartabata den ki agast 2014 main modi sarkaar ne videsh sachiv str kibaatcheet se pehlepakistan kii alagavaadi netaaon se milane kii maang ko thukraa diya tha or baad main isi vajah se baatcheet bhi radd ho gai thi
 In August 2015, Pakistan's National Security Advisor (NSA) was supposed to visit India, but with him Pakistan High Commissioner in Delhi spoke to Kashmiri separatist leaders after which India canceled the talks
 us vakt videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ne pakistan ko bharat yaa algaavvaadi netaaon main se kisi ek ko chunane tak kii baat kah daali thi
 Therefore, the Modi government has been seen to be taking a tough stance on the activities of the separatist organization Hurriyat, but after the meeting of the india-pakistan NSA in Bangkok, there was hope for talks on security and terrorism
 isse yah bhi spasht ho gaya ki sarkaar hurriyat ke pakistani netaaon se milane par bain lagaakar apni raah mushkil bana rahi he
 It is believed that this decision was taken after this
 is saal 23 march ko pakistan de ke maukey par pakistani ucchayog main hurriyat ke netaa maujuud the
 US President Donald Trump attacked Congress for not passing strict immigration laws and called the entire system of prosecuting and extraditing illegal migrants a "grossly useless process"
 kai twit kar trump ne kaha ki america kanoonon ke mutabik sarkaar dakshin seemaa paar karke aane waalon ko aasaani se waapas nahin bhej sakati
 More than 1,200 caravans of Central American migrants are heading towards the US south border, which Trump tweeted
 isse pehle trump ne mexico ko dhamkee di thi ki agar usne seemaa paar karke america aane se logon ko rokane ke liye or adhik kadam nahin uthaae to vah uske saath hue uttar america mukt vyapaar samjhauta khatm kar denge
 The comments raashtrapati ne twit kar kaha, ‘yah kitna moorkhtapurna he ki hamaare desh ke kanoon dakshini seemaa paar karke aane vaale logon ko waapas bhejne kii aasaani se anumati nahin dete hai
 This very useless process should be changed
 mexico or canada main sakht avrajan kanoon hai jabaki hamaare paas obama kaa kiya hua majaak he
 ' unhone kaha, ‘kaaravaan yahaan kii ore bad rahaa he
 Must pass strict laws and build walls

 ' madhya america pravaasiyon kaa 1,200 se adhik kaa kaaravaan america kii dakshin seemaa kii ore bad rahaa he jiske maddenjar trump ne twit kiye
 Trump had earlier threatened Mexico to end the North America Free Trade Agreement with him if he did not take further steps to prevent people from crossing the border into the US
 tippaniyan The President tweeted, "how foolish it is that the laws of our country do not allow the return of those crossing the southern border easily
" is nihaayat hi bekaar prakriya ko badalanaa chahie
 Mexico and Canada have strict immigration laws while we have a mockery of Obama
 ’ He said, 'the caravan is heading here

 The body of the mother of a jawan in Tangdhar in Jammu and Kashmir, cut off from the rest due to heavy snowfall, had to wait for five days for the last rites
 lagbhag 8 logon kii ek team ne jawan kii maa ke shav ko lekar 70 kilometre paidal tay kiye, lekin prashasan goonga baharaa bana dekhtaa rahaa
 Let us tell you that there has been heavy snowfall in this area since January 25
 jiske chalate ye ilaaka desh ke baaki hisson se cat chukaa he
 Jawan's Maskina Begum said goodbye to the world on 29 January at the Army Hospital in Pathankot due to heart attack
 wo apane parivaar ke saath karnah ke ek gaanv chitrakoot main rahati thim
 She was living here with her son for the last three months
 jab unki maut hui to sena ke afasaron ne unke bete ko bharosa diya ki wo har sambhav madad karenge lekin aisa kuch nahin hua
 Not only this, he also promised to transport the dead body from Srinagar to Karnah
 lekin jab unka shav srinagar pahunchaa to sena ke afasaron ne apane haath khadey kar die
 After this, the jawan along with his wife picked up the bodies of his mother and brought them to the Chowkibal where they spent 4 days
 vahaan ke sthaneey logon se jawan ko kaaphi madad mili
 Though the jawan, while staying in the guard, made every effort to contact the administration, he did not get any help
 jiske baad chaukeebal ke logon ne jawan kii marhoom maa ko apane kandhe par uthaa 70 kilometre kaa safar tay karke unke grihnagar tak pahunchaaya
 Defense Minister Arun Jaitley has called Pakistan's claim false, in which it refused to mutilate the bodies of Indian soldiers
 jetali ne kaha ki pakistan ke inkaar kii koi vishwasaneeyata nahin he
 This cannot happen without the patronage or participation of the army
 karrwai ke sawaal par jetali ne kaha ki apni fouj par bharosa rakhie
 The Defense Minister said that the entire incident shows that the soldiers were killed first and then the bodies were vandalized
 yah sena dwaara kiya gaya
 On a border with such a large defense, where there is a post on a few meters, this cannot happen without the collusion of his army
 bharat ne dikhaae sakht tevarisse pehle buudhvaar ko bharat ne sakht lahaze main kaha ki uske paas is baat ke paryaapt saboot hai ki is barbar, nrushans or amanviya ghatana main pakistani sena kaa haath he
 Along with this, India asked to take action against the soldiers and commanders responsible for this
 is ghatana se acroshit bharat ne pakistan ke ucchayukta abdul basit ko talab kiya or is ghatana ke saboot pakistani ucchyukt se saajha kiye
 Foreign Ministry spokesman Gopal Wagle told reporters, the Foreign Secretary summoned the Pakistani High Commissioner to make it clear that India considers vigorous action to incite the mutilation of soldiers' bodies and we have evidence that the Pakistani Army has it is hand
 bharat ne bataaya he ki bhartiya javaanon ke khun ke nishaan se ye baat saaf ho gayi he ki pakistani sainik bhartiya seemaa main aae the or hamaare javaanon ke ang apane saath le gaye 
 
 pravaktaa ne bataaya ki is nrushans hatya se pehle pakistani chaukiyon se golibari kii aad main pakistani sainik krishna ghati main niyantran rekha paar karke is ore aae

 If the path of country's power passes through Uttar Pradesh, then there is a political history behind it
 desh ko sabase zyada pradhanmantri isi soobe ne die hai or sabase zyada loksabhaa siten bhi yaheen hai
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party led by Narendra Modi formed the government at the Center by winning 71 seats in the state
 28 saal baad yah pehla mauka tha jabaki kisi party ko spasht bahumat mila tha
 Whereas Narendra Modi's charisma was working in making BJP the number one party in fourth position in UP
 vahiin, upi ke tatkaaleen party prabharee amit shah kii ranneeti bhi behad kargar sabit hui thi
 Like Modi, Amit Shah's home state is Gujarat
 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main 2014 jaise nattejey dohraane ke liye waisi hi jimmedaari ek baar phir gujarat se taalluk rakhane vaale party netaa govardhan jhadfia ko saunpi he
 He has been made BJP in-charge of UP on Wednesday
 dangon ke dauraan gujarat ke grahamantri the govardhan jhadfiyadilachasp baat ye he ki gujarat main narendra modi ke siem rahete hue amit shah grahamantri the
 Whereas in the Modi government, before Shah, the responsibility of the Home Minister of Gujarat was in the hands of Govardhan Zadaphia
 jhadfia ke grahamantri rahane ke dauraan hi saal 2002 main gujraj dange hue the
 Zadaphia moved to the side line only after 2002 and later in 2005 he left the party
 unhone keshubhai patel ke saath milakar gujarat parivartan party banaai, lekin unhen koi khaas safalataa nahin mili
 Keshubhai parted ways with the BJP, however, after the 2013 assembly elections, the Gujarat Parivartan Party formed by Keshubhai and Govardhan Zadaphia merged it with the BJP
 jhadfia bijepi main vaapasi ke baad se sanghathan main sakriy hai
 Before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, BJP has entrusted him with a big responsibility by making Govardhan Zadaphia in charge of Uttar Pradesh
 vahiin, soobe main sapa-basapa ke bich gathbandhan hota najar aa rahaa he
 This is the reason why the BJP has given a lot of thought to the command of Zadaphia province
 abivipi se shuru kiya tha safarjhadfia gujarat ke patidaar (patel) samudaay se aate hai or akhil bhartiya vidhyaarthee parishad ke jariye unhone apana siyaasi safar shuru kiya
 He has worked in the organization with leaders like Sanjay Joshi
 iske alaava kisaan netaa ke taur par bhi apni pahchaan banaai thi
 It can be clearly understood that Zadaphia can play an important role in strengthening the organization along with maintaining the caste equation in UP
 jhadfia jis samaaj se aate hai vah samaaj upi main obisi ke tahat aata he
 Kurmis constitute around 5% of the population in UP
 sapa-basapa gathbandhan kar unhen saadhane kii koshish main juta he
 The biggest challenge to do this equation in your favor will be over Zadafia
 is baar hogi agnipariksha2017 ke gujarat vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan hardik patel kaa patidaar andolan kii kaat ke liye bijepi ne jhadfia ko jimmedaari saunpi thi
 The result was that the BJP once returned to power
 haalanki kuch siten jarur kam ho gai hai
 In the UP assembly elections like this, he was entrusted with the responsibility of helping the farmers of the state
 isamen wo safal rahe the
 After this, his next fire test is to be held in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections

 Let me tell you, while talking to NDTV, Mohanan said, 'we felt that the work of the Commission was not very effective in discharging it
 pichley kuch samay se hamen mahasoos ho rahaa tha ki hamen kinare kar diya gaya or hamen gambhirtha se nahin liya gaya
 It is an apex body for all figures in the country
 lekin vah apane uddeshy main kaamyaab nahin ho rahi thi
 We were feeling like this
 'iske saath hi unhone pushti kii he ki naukariyon ke aankadon kii report jari na hona unke istife kii vajahon main se ek he
 The 2017-18 PLFS report of the National Sample Survey was approved by the Statistics Commission in December itself, but was not released
 is report main rojgaar or berogari ke aankaden hote hai
 Mohanan said, "this report was approved by the Commission for release, as the Statistics Commission approves all the reports of the National Sample Survey Department and we had approved the report for release
 ayog ke do sadasyon ke istife ke baad congress ke varisht netaa pi chidambaram (P Chidambaram) ne buudhvaar ko narendra modi sarkaar par nishaanaa saadhaa or kaha ki ‘is sanstha kii aatma ko shanti mili, jab tak ki iskaa dobaaraa janm naa ho jaae
 p Chidambaram made three consecutive tweets one after the other and attacked the Modi government
 unhone likhaa- sarkaar kii badaniyat ke chalate 29 janvari, 2019 ko ek or sammanit santhaan khatm ho gaya
 After defeating the SP-BSP in Uttar Pradesh, BJP is now eyeing the votes of particular castes in Purvanchal
 iske liye purvanchal main prabhavi choti dalon kii jameen khinchne main bijepi jute gai he
 Through the two faces of Purvanchal, the BJP is engaged in the mission of getting Rajbhar and Kurmi votes in its court
 bijepi ne ek ranneeti ke tahat suheldev bhartiya samaaj party (subhaspa) ke mukhiya om prakaash rajbhar ke mukaable anil rajbhar or apana dal kii anupriya patel ke saamne ramashankar patel ko majboot kar apane iraade jaahir kar die hai
 The BJP is trying to bring the core voters of these small parties outright
 kaha ja rahaa he ki bijepi kaa maananaa he ki sahyogi party- apana dal ke prati naram hokar kurmi voton ko apane paale main nahin laayaa ja saktaa
 This will have to be planned
 yahi vajah he ki pehle modi sarkaar main anupriya patel kaa patta saaf hua or ab yogi sarkaar ke mantriparishad vistaar main unke pati ashish patel ko jagah nahin mili
 It is believed that the BJP is no longer in the mood to leave scope for other parties, encouraged by the widespread support from all castes in the 2017 assembly and 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 yahi vajah he ki suheldev bhartiya samaaj party ke baad ab apana dal ke kor voters ko bhi paale main karne ke liye bijepi ne daanv chal diya he
 BJP leaders, however, deny any plans to pull the ground of smaller parties
 unka kahana he ki yah to party vistaar kii swaabhaavik prakriya he
 Where there is scope, the party will strengthen itself and its leader
 haalanki upi ke bijepi netaa apana dal se pehle kii tarah hi sahaj rishte hone kii baat bhi kehete hai
 BJP strengthened Patel leader in Anupriya district, where Anupriya Patel wanted to see her husband and Apna Dal national president Ashish Patel as minister in Yogi government
 mantriparishad ke vistaar se pehle apana dal kaaryakarta ashish patel ke mantri banane ko lekar bahut aatmavishvaas se daawey kar rahe the, magar aisa kuch nahin hua
 The BJP worked to strengthen and strengthen its MLA Ramashankar Patel from Marihan in Mirzapur, replacing Ashish Patel
 raajnneetik vishleshkon kaa maananaa he ki sahyogi dal ke 'ghar' main hi kisi patel netaa ko mantripad dekar majboot karne ke peeche bijepi kii badi yojana he
 It is in a way an attempt by the BJP to elevate another Patel leader parallel to the Anupriya Patel family
 sandesh saaf he ki bijepi apana dal or anupriya ko bhav nahin de rahi
 BJP will no longer rely on Anupriya Patel for Patel votes
 darasal, modi sarkaar kii pehali pari main anupriya patel ko swasthya evam parivaar kalyaan rajya mantri banaaya gaya tha
 But in the second innings of the Modi government, Anupriya Patel was not given a place in the Council of Ministers
 iske baad baad mana ja rahaa tha ki iske badale bijepi unke pati or apana dal ke rashtriya adhyaksh ashish patel ko yogi sarkaar main jagah degi
 Since Ashish Patel is an MLC, it was believed that the BJP created an MLC to make him a minister in the state
 magar buudhvaar ko mantriparishad ke vistaar ke dauraan ashish kaa naam mantriyon kii suchi se gaayab rahaa
 Reason for disinterested with Apna Dal: What is the reason behind bjp's displeasure with Anupriya Patel family? Neither Anupriya Patel got a place in the Modi government when she was an MP, nor did her husband Ashish get an opportunity to become a minister in the Yogi government when she was an MLC
 iske peeche anupriya patel ke loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan bijepi ke saath kiye bartaav ko kaaran bataaya ja rahaa
 BJP sources say that during the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Anupriya Patel came down on seats
 yahaan tak ki unke priyanka gandhi ke bhi sampark main hone kii khabaren ain thim
 Since there was an opportunity for elections at that time, the BJP was silent
 party ko lag rahaa tha ki abhi kisi tarah kii pratikriya jaahir hone se kurmi voton kaa nuksaan uthaanaa pad saktaa he
 But even after the SP-BSP alliance in the Lok Sabha elections, the BJP in UP was able to win 65 seats and in almost all castes, the party was able to make a dent, then the party stopped giving any money to Anupriya Patel
 chunki 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi 2014 se bhi zyada majboot hokar ubhari to anupriya patel ko bhi laga ki bijepi ke saath hi rahane main bhalaai he, baagi banane main nuksaan
 The reason is that Anupriya Patel also felt the danger of a break in the party after encountering the BJP
 apana dal ke paas nau vidhayak or do saansad hai
 In which Anupriya Patel is also an MP herself
 bijepi ateet main kai chote dalon ko tod chuki he
 In such a situation, sources are saying that Anupriya Patel is compelled to stay with the BJP even if there is no representation in both the central and state governments
 rajbhar ko pehle hi kamjor kar chuki bijepibijepi ne uttar pradesh main rajbhar voton ke liye 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav se pehle om prakaash rajbhar kii suheldev bhartiya samaaj party (subhaspa) ke saath gathbandhan kiya tha
 Rajbhar voters prove decisive in many seats in Purvanchal
 gathbandhan kaa laabh bijepi ko mila tha
 As a result, Om Prakash Rajbhar became a cabinet minister in the Yogi government
 magar bijepi ne dhire-dhire banaras kii shivpuri seat se vidhayak anil rajbhar ko majboot karnaa shuru kiya
 Om Prakash Rajbhar took it as a challenge
 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan om prakaash rajbhar bhi siton kaa molbhav karne lage
 At the same time, he started making statements against the BJP
 party matdaan tak shant rahi
 But after the voting and a week before the results came, Yogi dismissed Om Prakash Rajbhar
 jiske baad unke pichhadaa varg vibhaag ko anil rajbhar ko siem yogi ne saunp diya
 Now, the BJP has promoted Anil Rajbhar as a cabinet minister
 mana ja rahaa he ki anil rajbhar ko majboot kar bijepi rajbharon ko sandesh dena chaahati he ki unki jati main om prakaash rajbhar se zyada ek shaktishaalee netaa he
 More bets for Kurmi votesbjp has made many bets for Kurmi votes
 masalan, ramashankar patel ko jahaan mantri banaaya
 At the same time, Swatantradev, who had a relationship with the Kurmi caste, has been made the state president
 vahiin haal main anandiben patel ko rajyapal banaaya gaya he
 Sources reveal that this has sent a message among Kurmi voters in the state that the BJP is giving good representation to people of their caste

 is bayaan se unki bhaavana ko kaaphi thes pahunchi he
 The Congress is constantly targeting the central government for not providing employment as promised

 On two or four occasions, the government became the champion of Hindi by speaking Hindi, but these students seeking to introduce talent in their language were branded as Hindi Medium

 Naval officials said that until the sailor is discharged from the army, he will be given lighter responsibilities as women cannot be given seafaring, as it is not yet allowed
 adhikariyon ne bataaya ki navik ne kaha tha ki vah 'ek aadmi ke sharir main fansi ek mahila kii tarah' mahasoos kar rahaa tha, isliye usne ye faisla kiya
 According to his sources, he is happy with the Navy's decision that he will be thrown out of service
