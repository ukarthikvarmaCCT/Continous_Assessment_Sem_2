 Leader of Opposition in Madhya Pradesh Ajay Singh said that it is clear that the government is trying to suppress the voice of the opposition due to not discussing corruption in the assembly and the termination of membership of the two Congress mlas

 Talking to reporters in the assembly premises, Singh said that the opposition wanted to discuss the growing corruption in the state in the assembly, for this, adjournment proposals were also given, but the government kept avoiding it and when the protest was expressed, the membership of two Congress mlas Was abolished
 yah vipaksh kii aawaaj ko dabaane kii koshish he
 Singh said that till yesterday, it seemed that the two businessmen who raided the Income Tax department had the support of the mlas and the ministers of the government, but the lack of discussion on corruption has proved that these have proved to the Chief Minister Chauhan There is a direct relationship
 singh ne ek sawaal ke jawaab main kaha he ki jo charchaa vidhansabha main kuch ghanton me khatm ho jaati, use ab gaanv-gaanv tak pahunchaaya jayega

 akhil bhartiya kisaan sangharsh samiti ne pichley maheene kii 31 taarikh ko raashtrapati ko ek gyaapan saunpa or unase maang kii ki kisaanon kii samasyaon ko sunne ke liye vishesh satr bulaanaa chahie
 The same thing happened as it was in today's political climate
 is mudde par aage koi charchaa nahin hui
 Those who came to meet the President under the banner of Kisan Sangharsh Samiti included senior Maharashtra MLA and MLA Raju Sethi

 "we have argued that when a special session can be convened at midnight on GST, then why cannot it be called for farmers? But in the memorandum submitted to His Majesty, there was one more thing which is more important to mention at this time
 vah yah ki purv pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi ne 11 disambar 2003 ko basti jile ke mandarva gaanv main hui maut ke baad krishi or kisaanon ke sankat par charchaa karne ke liye sansad kaa vishesh satr bulaayaa tha
 In fact, yesterday when Murali Manohar Joshi returned to see the currently unwell Atal Bihari Vajpayee, he said one thing, "perhaps nature has silenced him because what would he say in view of today's political situation?" Atal ji had a different style of speaking his words

 He said this when asked about the health of Atal ji by journalists
 murali manohar joshi ne kaha ki atal ji kii rog pratirohak kshamta behad kam ho gai he
 So no one is being allowed to meet them
 aspataal ke kamare ke daravaaje main lagi khidki ke jariye unhen dekha ja saktaa he
 The sadness of Murali Manohar Joshi is justified, because when Rahul Gandhi arrived to pay tribute to the farmers killed in the Mandsaur firing on June 6, it was termed as politics by a political section
 or yaad kiya gaya ki kis tarah 1998 main congress ke diggaj netaa or us vakt rajya ke mukhyamantri digvijay singh ne soyabean kisaanon par goliyaan chalavaain thim
 Whether Digvijay Raj or Shiva 'raj' farmers do not have the right to share the bullets
 murali manohar joshi kii yah tippanee ek sawaal jarur paidaa karti he, kya behad vakpatu or gambhir se gambhir baat ko sahajata se kehane main sakasham atal bihari vaajapeyi agar aaj sehatmand hote to kya kuch kah paane main sakasham hote?*** Former Deputy General Secretary of AIADMK and Sasikala's nephew TTV Dinakaran has been sent to police remand for five days by the Tees Hajri Court

 That is, in this country with a population of 125 crores, less than 1 percent people pay tax on business
 aisa isliye ki bharat ek aisa desh he jahaan log tex bachaane, chhipaane or churaane ke liye duniyabar main kukhyat hai
 India's sovereign rating on the international stage is extremely low due to tax evasion and black business in the country

 GST se kaise rukegi kaala bazaari?bharat main lagu jiesti ke praavdhaan kii sabase khaas baat yah he ki yahaan kaarobaar kaa digitaliseshan kiya ja rahaa he
 To do this effectively, a tax credit system has been created in GST
 iske tahat kaarobaari ko apane product athwa seva ke invais ko prati mahjiasti portelpar aplod karnaa hoga
 The software installed in the GST network will be used to match this invoice with the data of suppliers and vendors
 or yah milan sahi paae jane par kaarobaari ko tex credit kaa phayda milegaa
 Due to this rule, businessmen in the country will have to resort to registered suppliers and vendors only to get out of black business
 ye saplir or vendor bhi registerd hone ke saath hi 20 lakh rupee ke turnover se adhik hone par jiesti ke daayre main honge
 At the same time, traders will be forced to work only with registered suppliers and vendors to take advantage of the tax credit, otherwise they will face the challenge of losing customers

 Mulayam Singh Yadav has given a big statement, putting an end to the ongoing war in the Samajwadi Party for the last several months
 mulaayam ne kaha ki samaajawaadee party main ab koi vivaad nahin he or akhilesh yadav hi party kii ore se agle mukhyamantri honge
 He said that the party is one and he will campaign for Akhilesh across the state
 mulaayam kii maane to samaajawaadee party main bikharaav kaa sawaal hi nahin uthta he
 That is, the Mulayam faction succumbed to the Akhilesh group
 isse pehle mulaayam singh yadav somvaar ko chunaav ayog gaye or party chihn 'cycle' par daawa jataayaa
 Mulayam Singh said that the commission will decide on the party symbol
 hamane apni baat chunaav ayog ke saamne rakh di he

 unhone kaha ki agar chunaav ayog cycle ko fries kar detaa he to aise halaat main wo ayog se 'motorcycle' ko chunaav-chihn ke liye maang karenge
 Some people are misleading Akhilesh: Before this, Mulayam Singh was confronted with the media after he spoke before the Election Commission
 mulaayam singh ne kaha ki party simbel par faisla ayog karegaa
 We will issue a letter on the basis of that the candidate will contest the election
 mulaayam singh ne kaha ki party main koi matbhed nahin hai
 Those who are few will be resolved soon

 -nae adhyaksh ke chunaav ke liye namakan kii prakriya jaruri he taaki sabhi logon ko iske liye baraabar mauka mil sake
 It was not followed
 -ramgopal yadav pehle hi mahasachiv pad se hataa die gaye the
 He cannot bring any proposal
 unhen twitor ke jariye party main phir se shaamil kiya gaya jo ki vaid nahin he
 If no proposal is passed to remove Mulayam Singh from the post of President, then the question of election of new president arises
 EC se jald faisle kii apilis bich, akhilesh khemaa bhi chunaav ayog pahunchaa he
 After Mulayam, Naresh Aggarwal and Ram Gopal Yadav reached the Election Commission on behalf of Akhilesh faction
 akhilesh kheme ke niraj shekhar, akshay yadav, surendra nagar, abhishek mishra, niraj shekhar, kiranmay nanda bhi chunaav ayog gaye the

 He accused Akhilesh of being confused and said that some people are trying to divide the family and the party

 Both groups have also visited before

 The ball is in the court of election commission
 sulah kii koshishon par ajam khan ne kaha ki maine hameshaa pul kaa kaam kiya he
 There is a lot of haze
 koshish jari he
 It is not dark yet
 sabhi aihtiyaat baratna chahie ki rishton main or khatas naa ho
 This is the worst of all Muslims, they are afraid that it might not benefit BJP and fascist forces will not benefit
 isse pehle ravivaar komulaayam sinhane ek samvaadadaata sammelan main saaf kaha ki main ab bhi samaajawaadee party kaa adhyaksh hum or shivpal yadav sapa ke upi adhyaksh hai
 Along with this, he said that Ram Gopal Yadav has been excluded from the party, in which case he has no right to call a session
 vahiin sutron se khabar he ki amar singh ne mulaayam singh ke saamne party se istife kii peshkash kii he
 Former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister and senior Congress leader ND Tiwari has written to Mulayam Singh Yadav asking him to hand over political legacy to Akhilesh

 During this, he called the workers who were raising slogans outside and said that Akhileshmera is the only boy
 ab ham kya karen, vah jo kar rahaa he use karne do, ham kya kar sakate hai
 Will give you few marks ab sab kuch uske paas he, mere paas kya he
 i have a counting legislator
 akhilesh ke khilaaf mulaayam kuch bhi nahin bole, haa yah jarur kaha ki kai jagah sadakon kaa vikaas hua he, to usamen peedblyoody ministar shivpal yadav kaa bhi yogadan he
 In this way, Mulayam praised Shivpal
 us vakt shivpal saath hi baithe the
 On the issue of triple talaq in the Muslim society, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said that he has full faith in India's tradition in this matter
 unhone kaha ki muslim samaaj ke log khud is ladaai ke khilaaf aage aaen or is mudde kaa raajnneetikaran nahin hona chahie
 PM Modi was addressing a program organized at Vigyan Bhavan to commemorate Visvesvara Jayanti
 bhagwaan vasaveshwar ko yaad karte hue piem modi ne kaha ki samaaj ke har varg se aane vaali mahilaon ko unhone apane vichaar vyakt karne kaa haq diya
 Women from every section of society expressed their views
 kai mahilaayein aisi bhi hoti thim jinhen us samay samaaj main vyaapt buraaiyon ke tahat tiraskrit samajha jaataa tha lekin waisi mahilaon ko bhi anubhav mandap main apni baat rakhane kaa puraa adhikaar tha
 In the era of women's empowerment, this was a big effort, we can imagine, it has been the specialty of our country that evils have come, but the challenge of fighting against them has also arisen within us
 piem modi ne kaha ki jis samay raja rammohan raay ne vidhwaa vivaah kii baat rakhi hogi us samay ke samaaj ne kitni unki aalochana kii hogi lekin wo ade rahe, ki maataaon-bahanon ke saath ye ghor anyaay he ise dur hona chahie isliye main kabhi-kabhi sochataa hum ki teen talaak ko lekar aaj itani badi bahes chal rahi he lekin bharat kii mahaan parampara ko dekhte hue mere man main aashaa kaa sanchaar ho rahaa he ki is desh main samaaj ke bheetar se hi taqatvar log nikalate hai jo aprasangik paramparaon ko todate hai aadhunik vyavasthaaon ko viksit karte hai
 Such enlightened people will also be born from the Muslim society, they will come forward and they will fight themselves against whatever is being passed on to the daughters of Muslim society and they will find a way out at some point

 PM said that everyone should be respected, caste system, untouchability such as untouchability, everyone should have the opportunity to be equal, this is what Lord Vishweshwar wanted
 unhone har maanav main bhagwaan ko dekha tha
 He said that this body is a temple in which the soul is God
 samaaj main oonchanich kaa bhedbhaav khatm ho, shram kaa samman ho, har vyakti kaa shashaktikaran ho ye siddhant kisi bhi samaaj or loktantr ke liye majboot neenv kii tarah he
 The PM said that Lord Vishweshwar used to say that do not ask what caste and faith the man is, just say that it is ours
 ham sabake bich kaa ek he
 a strong nation is built on this foundation
 yahi siddhant raashtra ke liye niti nirdeshak kaa kaam karte hai
 PM Modi said that Lord Basaveshwar had formed the basis of these ideas for 800 years on the land of India, the same resonance in the government's mantra of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas
 bina bhedbhaav is desh ke har vyakti kaa apana ghar hona chahie
 Everyone should get 24 hours of electricity
 har gaanv main sadak, kisaan ko beemaa, khaad, pani mili yahi to he sabakaa saath sabakaa vikaas or ye desh main bahut aavashyak he sabko saath lekar, sabake prayaas se sabakaa vikaas kiya ja saktaa he
 In the past, ever since a picture of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has gone viral with Rakesh Singh, the main accused in Bhojpur liquor case, politics of dirty picture has been seen in Bihar
 chaahe vah sattadal ho yaa phir virdohi dal, donon ek duusare ke khilaaf vivaadaaspad photo jari kar rahe hai or raajnneeti kar rahe hai
 In the same sequence, on Friday, JDU released a photo at a press conference, in which former Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav is seen with a girl
 is tasviir par sawaal uthaate hue jediu pravaktaa sanjay singh ne kaha kitejasvi yadavasharaab kaa seven karte hai or ladakiyon ke saath dikhte hai
 Sanjay Singh said that RJD supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav and Tejashwi Yadav should peek into his house before attacking Nitish Kumar
 jediu pravaktaa sanjay singh ke dwaara tejasvi par kiye gaye hamale kaa jawaab bhi tejasvi ne turant diya
 While Tejashwi confessed that he was seen in photos with Islarki, but refused to recognize the girl
 tejasvi ne nitish par bhi hamalaa bolaa or ishaaron-ishaaron main sawaal poocha ki jab nitish kumaar dilli jaaya karte hai to vah bihar nivas main apana saamaan rakhkar palam vihaar or dwarka main kya karne jate hai? tejasvi ne nitish kumaar se judaa sawaal poocha ki jab vah rail mantri the to unhone archana express or upasna express train kis ke naam par shuru kiya tha?haalanki, bihar kii darty pikchar politics us vakt or darty ho gai tejasvi ke patrkaar sammelan main argedy ke vidhayak or pravaktaa shakti singh yadav ne ek tasviir jari kar diya jisamen jadyu pravaktaa sanjay singh ke bete ek ladki ke saath najar aa rahe
 Significantly, while responding to the personal attack on Nitish Kumar by the Tenth, JDU spokesman Neeraj Kumar said that if Nitish named the trains Archana Express and Upasana Express, what is wrong with it? Lashing out at Lalu Prasad, Neeraj Kumar questioned that if these trains were not named Archana Express and Upasana Express, should it be the Corruption Express and the Convicted Express? sattaaise aktubar ko haryana rajbhavan main jhatpat yojit shapath-grahan samaaroh main sabhi kii nazren nae upmukhyamantri dushyant chautaala par tiki thim
 The 31-year-old Jat leader was a shocking face for everyone in this election
 unki 10 maheene puraani party jananaayak janata party (jejepi) ne 90 sadasyon vaali vidhansabha main ek hi jatke main 10 siten jeet leen
 The grandson of Devilal, grandson of Om Prakash Chautala and this son of Ajay Chautala decided to form the government with the BJP and took oath of office as Deputy Chief Minister, standing next to Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar
 apane chote se rajnatik karier main—dushyant ne 2014 main 26 saal kii umr main loksabhaa kaa chunaav jitkar sabase yuva saansad ke taur par record book main apana naam darj karaayaa tha—chautaala parivaar ke is vanshaj ne apni chhavi 'pehla sajjan chautaala' kii pesh kii he jo unke khandaan kii dabang netaaon vaali chhavi ke bilkul vipareet he
 Educated in a public school, English-speaking Dushyant is the new face of Jat leadership in Haryana
 ve parivaar main apane se bado kii jati-kendrit raajnneeti se alag hatakar sabhi 36 birdariyon ko saath lekar chalane kii baat karte hai
 However, this predominantly farming caste has a share of about 26 per cent of the total population and is the highest among the jjp's 15 per cent votes
 jejepi ke 10 main se 5 vidhayak jat hai
 Both parties were trying to draw Dushyant to the side as the BJP got six seats by majority and Congress by 15 seats by majority
 lekin agle din jab ve adhyapakon kii bhartee ghotaale ke aarope main tihaad jail main band apane pita ajay chautaala or dada om prakaash chautaala se milane gaye to ajay chautaala ne unhen salaah di ki ve bhupinder singh hooda ke saath na jaaen kyonki aisa karne se unke liye jaaton main apni pakad majboot banane kaa avasar ksheen ho jayega
 This time Hooda got the most benefit of anti-khattar sentiments among the Jats
 lekin hooda abhi idi or sibiai kii jaanch ke maamalon main uljhe hue hai
 Professor Abhay Dubey at the Center for Study of Developing Societies says, "the weaker Hooda is, the more Dushyant will get
 iske alaava unhen yuva hone kaa bhi phayda hoga
 On the other hand, the BJP decided to wait for Dushyant before presenting his claim to form the government, while it had the support of seven independent mlas, Abhay Chautala of Indian National Lok Dal and Gopal Goyal Kanda of Haryana Lokhit Party
 kendriya grahamantri amit shah dushyant kaa samarthan lene ke icchhuk the (haalanki bhaajapa main ek varg log isse sahamat nahin tha) kyonki isse party ko alag-thalag padi jat birdari main apni pahunch banane main madad milti
 The BJP had opened up two avenues for talks with Dushyant — former Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal had approached him on the afternoon of October 24, when Minister of State for Finance Anurag Thakur later spoke to him on behalf of Amit Shah
 apane pita se milane ke baad dushyant ne thakur ko phone kiya or apni sharton ke bare main bataaya: upmukhyamantri kaa pad ore do vidhayakon ke liye cabinet or rajyamantri kaa pad
 The agreement was finalized
 phir thakur or dushyant is saude ko aupchaarik rup dene ke liye amit shah ke nivas par gaye
 Dushyant may have taken political risk by aligning with BJP, but this is not a new risk for him
 unchana kalam se chunaav ladgaye kaa unka faisla bhi bahut jokhim bharaa tha

 bharat kii ore se china ke teen patrakaron ke vija kii avadhi badhaane se inkaar kiye jane par china ke ek sarkari akhbaar ne hindustan ko chetavanee di he
 The daily newspaper has written that if this step is a reaction of China not supporting it in trying to gain membership of India in the NSG, then this would have serious consequences
 ‘da global times’ ke sampadakeey main kaha gaya, 'aise kayaas lagaae ja rahe hai ki chunkichinan parmaanu aapurtikarta samooh (enesji) main bharat ke shaamil hone kaa virodh kiya, isliye bharat ab badla le rahaa he
 If New Delhi is really taking revenge due to the NSG membership issue then it will have serious consequences
 ' bataa den ki china kii sarkari samachar agency shinhua ke teen chini patrakaron kii bharat main rahane kii avadhi badhaane se inkaar kar diya gaya he
 Visa period ending in late July These three journalists include Delhi-based bureau chief Wu Qiang and two Mumbai-based correspondents - Tang Lu and Ma Qiang
 patrakaron ke vija kii avadhi is maah ke ant main puri ho rahi he
 All three of them had sought extension of the visa period till the journalists who held these positions came after them
 'yah videshi media kaa nishkasana'sampadakeey main kaha gaya ki bharat ke is kadam ko kuch videshi media sansthaanon ne ek ‘nishkasana’ qaraar diya he
 The Global Times said in an editorial, "no official reason was given for not extending the visa period
 kuch bhartiya media sansthaanon kaa daawa he ki in teen patrakaron par farji naamon kaa istemaal kar dilli or mumbai ke kaipratibandhit vibhagonmen pahunch banane kaa andeh he
 'there are also reports that these journalists met with exiled Tibetan activists

 Negative effect on relations 'expulsion of correspondents by India is a cheap act', the editorial said in the headline, "the move has sent negative messages and this will undoubtedly have a negative impact on the media interaction between China and India
" ' isamen daawa kiya gaya he ki enesji main bharat kii sadsyta kaa virodh karke china ne kuch anuchit nahin kiya
 It followed the rule that all NSG members are required to sign the non-proliferation Treaty (NPT)
 'chini vija praapt karnaa bhi aasaan nahin'samachar patr ne kaha, 'bharat kaa dimag shankaalu he
 Whether Chinese correspondents apply for a long-term visa or a temporary journalist visa, they will face many problems

 Several steps are being taken to protect children from pressure in board examinations in Gujarat
 10veen or 12veen kii board kii parikshaayen buudhvaar ko shuru ho gayi
 This year more than 12 lakh students are taking this exam in Gujarat
 pariksha ke pehle din skool karmiyon ne kahin tilak karke to kahin phool dekar or kahin prasad dekar bacchon kaa pariksha kendron par swaagat kiya
 Every school saw an effort to relieve children from stress in examinations
 har saal kai bachche pariksha ke bhay se yaa pariksha main behatar pradarshan na kar paane par galat kadam uthaa baithte hai
 Keeping this in mind, these steps are being taken
 tippaniyan During the examination, there should be no pressure on the children, parents are also awakened
 ek pita dow mehul mashkaaria ne kaha ki ve samaaj main dekh rahe hai ki bacchon par beintahaa dabaav daalaa ja rahaa he
 It seems like this is the ultimate test of life

 We have seen this many times
 isliye mehnat ke baad ab bacchon ko mukt man se pariksha dene kaa maahaul bananaa chahie
 There is no pressure on the children, like many other examinations of the board, it is easy for the children to pass easily

 pariksha ke dauraan bacchon par zyada dabaav na banaaya jaae, ise lekar abhibhavakon main bhi jagriti aa rahi he
 One father, Dr
 Mehul Mashkariya, said that he is seeing in the society that children are being put under tremendous pressure
 aisa lagata he jaise yah jivan kii antim pariksha he
 By putting pressure on children to top, there is a disadvantage of children rather than benefits
 aisa bahut baar hamane dekha he
 Therefore, after hard work, children should now create an atmosphere to give exams with a free mind
 bacchon par dabaav na ho, board kii pariksha bhi anya parikshaon kii tarah hi bacchon ke liye aasaan gujaren iske liye kai sansthaaen bhi vishesh kaam kar rahi hai
 The head of one such organization, Oasis, Dr
 Maya Soni, said that he was a little worried about the recent environment
 ve bacchon ko samajhaana chaahati hai ki jindagi main or bahut saare avasar milane vaale hai
 Even if we are not able to do very well in this examination, much more has to happen in life
 shaayad in koshishon kaa hi nateeja he ki is saal pariksha se pehle koi durghatana nahin hui he

 nagar vimaanan mantralay beuro of civil aviation security ke tahat sabhi hawaii addon kii suraksha ke liye ek alag force chahta tha
 But this suggestion has been rejected by the Ministry of Home Affairs
 ab faisla liya gaya he ki desh ke sabhi hawaii addon kii suraksha kii jimmedaari kendriya audyogic suraksha bal (siaisef) ko de di jaaegi
 This decision was taken in a high level meeting
 isamen grih rajyamantri kiren rijiju, naagarik uddyan mantri jayant sinha, rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar ajit dobhaal, diibi dineshwar sharma ke alaava grih mantralay or BCAS ke afasar shaamil the

" ek plan par sabhi agenciyaan kaam kar rahi hai
 " enditivi india ko mili jaankaree ke mutabik is ucch stareey baithak main yah nateeja niklaa ki bharat main jitne bhi hawaii adde hai ve suraksha kii drushti se samvedansheel hai
 The biggest danger is from the routes that go from the city to the airports
 vahaan se visphotak aasaani se hawaii adde tak pahunchaae ja sakate hai yaa phir fidaayin bhi entry get tak pahunch sakate hai
 That is why it was decided to increase random checking on the routes from the city to the airports
 hawaii addon ko doosraa khatra cargo said kii taraf se he
 For this, it was decided that the patrolling cargo area should also be increased
 iske alaava tay kiya gaya ki jo maapdand grih mantralay ne tay kiye hai unhen rajyon ko apnaanaa hoga
 The meeting decided that soon CISF will be deployed at 98 airports in the country
 philhal 98 hawaii addon main se 59 siaisef ke paas hai or baaki 39 anya suraksha balon ke adheen hai
 According to the Home Ministry, 26 out of 98 are highly sensitive
 dilli or mumbai ke airport hyper sensitive category main aate hai
 18 of the more sensitive 26 airports have CISF deployments
 srinagar or imphal main (kendriya rigerv police bal) siarpief suraksha kaa jimmaa nibhaati he
 There are 58 airports in the sensitive category
 inamen se 37 main siaisef suraksha karti he
 Four of the 16 airports in the third category are under CISF
 siaisef ke diji surendra singh ke mutabik hawaii addon kii suraksha sabase ahm he
 To make the security shield more robust, the mechanism of counter-emergency needs to be strengthened
 diji kaa yah bhi kahana he ki hawaii addon ke paas said len bhi honi chahie taaki agar kisi gaadi par andeh ho to vahaan le jaakar uski checking kii ja sake
 In the meeting, it was also decided to install hi-tech system to scan the luggage of the passengers
 airporton ke baahar bakhtarband gadiyon ko tainaat karne kaa nirnay bhi liya gaya
 The comments rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar ajit dobhaal kaa kahana tha ki chunki grih mantralay ke paas suraksha audit karne kaa adhikaar he isliye samiksha bhi mantralay ko hi kerani chahie na ki BCAS ko
 According to him, the sensitivity of each airport should be assessed and for this the team itself should visit all the airports for review
 unhone kaha ki "har airport kii samvedansheeltaa clacyphid kii jaani chahie
 " baithak main sabase zyada chintaa airporton ke aasapaas kii imaaraton ko lekar jataai gai
 Doval said that if the BCAS cannot assess the security of these buildings, then the Ministry of Home Affairs should do this assessment
 civil aviation secreteri rajeev nayan choube kaa suzav tha ki bihaviour monitoring maikenism or yatriyon kii profiling karnaa bhi jaruri he
 The Ministry of Civil Aviation wanted a separate force under the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security to protect all airports
 lekin is suzav ko grih mantralay ne khaarij kar diya he
 It has now been decided that the responsibility of security of all the airports in the country will be given to the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF)
 yah faisla ek ucch stareey baithak main liya gaya
 This included Minister of State for Home Kiren Rijiju, Civil Aviation Minister Jayant Sinha, National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, DIB Dineshwar Sharma, besides the Ministry of Home Affairs and officers of the BCAS

 All agencies are working on a plan
 " According to information received by NDTV India, in this high level meeting, it was concluded that all the airports in India are sensitive in terms of security
 sabase zyada khatra un raaston se he jo shahar kii ore se hawaii addon kii ore jate hai
 From there, explosives can be easily transported to the airport or even fidayeen can reach the entry gate
 isiilie faisla liya gaya ki shahar se airporton tak jane vaale raaston par random checking badhaai jaae
 The second threat to airports is from the cargo side
 iske liye faisla hua ki petroling cargo aria bhi badhaayaa jaae
 Apart from this, it has been decided that the criteria set by the Home Ministry will be adopted by the states
 baithak main faisla hua ki jald hi desh ke 98 airporton par siaisef kii tainaati kii jaaegi
 Currently, 59 of the 98 airports are with the CISF and the remaining 39 are under other security forces
 grih mantralay ke mutabik 98 main se 26 behad samvedansheel hai
 Airports in Delhi and Mumbai fall under the hyper sensitive category

 According to CISF DG Surendra Singh, security of airports is of paramount importance
 suraksha kavach ko or zyada pukhta banane ke liye counter insargency ke maikenism ko pukhta karne kii jarurat he
 The DG also says that airports should also have side lanes so that if a vehicle is suspected, it can be taken and checked there
 baithak main yatriyon ke saamaan ko scan karne ke liye hitech system lagane kaa faisla bhi hua
 It was also decided to deploy armored vehicles outside the airports
 tippaniyan National Security Advisor Ajit Doval said that since the Ministry of Home Affairs has the authority to conduct security audits, the review should be done by the Ministry itself and not the BCAS
 unke mutabik har airport kii samvedansheeltaa kaa akalan kiya janaa chahie or iske liye team ko khud samiksha ke liye sabhi hawaii addon par janaa chahie
 He said that "the sensitivity of every airport should be classified
 " The biggest concern in the meeting was raised about the buildings around the airports
 dobhaal kaa kahana tha ki agar BCAS in imaaraton kii suraksha kaa akalan nahin kar saktaa to phir yah akalan grih mantralay ko karnaa chahie
 Civil Aviation Secretary Rajeev Nayan Choubey suggested that behavior monitoring mechanisms and profiling of passengers is also necessary

 This may sound sarcastic, but the truth is that the common man is the biggest winner of the 2009 general elections because he has given the Congress such a mandate that it can no longer have any excuse for not working
 haalanki in chunaavon ko muddavihin kaha ja rahaa tha, lekin sabase bada mudda tha-bhartiya raajnneeti kii khandit prakruti
 This issue has been resolved for at least the next five years
 vamapanthiyon kii haar khaas taur se mahatvapurn rahi
 He did nothing to spread the myth that the 2004 mandate was against reforms
 samyavaadiyon ne puri duniya main aadhi juthi-aadhi sachhee baaten kehane kii kala main maharath hasil kar lee he or hamaare apane kamred bhi isamen peeche nahin hai
 The result was that the UPA government failed to bring the economic reforms that Congress had promised in its election manifesto
 yah baat digar he ki shiksha or grih sareekhe mahatvapurn vibhaag sanbhaalane vaale uske mantriyon ne kuch nahin kiya or acha kaam karne se kahin zyada kaam kharaab hi kiya
 However, there may be wrong reasons behind the defeat of the Left
 jahaan mamata banerjee vamapanthiyon ke khilaaf apane teen dashak puraane abhiyaan ke boote marxvaadi garh ko dhwast karne main safal rahi hai, vahiin naino car pariyojna ke hat jane se pashchim bengal ko apurnty kshati hui he
 We all know what Mamata opposes
 lekin asli sawaal yah he ki unka najariya kya he?mahatvakanksha kii raajnneetiagale paanch varshon tak congress ko aisi sarkaar kii aguai nahin kerani hogi jiske raste main uske saajheedaar lagaataar mushkilen paidaa karte hai or taang khichate rahete hai
 After the 2004 elections, Drs
 manmohan singh ne ghoshnaa kii thi ki unki sarkaar kargar sarkaar sabit hogi or shashan ke morche par sudhaar laaegi
 But his government started implementing populist schemes
 us samay arthvyavastha main oochaal aayaa hua tha jiske kaaran in yojanaon ke liye dhan kii kami nahin padi
 But the boom in the economy was the result of the policies of the last five years more than the policies of the UPA government
 vaishvik arthvyavastha main aae oochaal ne bhi usamen mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai thi
 But now that the pace of development has slowed down, the pressure has also increased on the government exchequer
 puure desh kii yatra karne par ek baat spasht ho jaati he ki janaakanksha kaa str hameshaa ke liye badal gaya he
 There is no doubt that media, mobile telephony and roads development programs, especially the nda's programs, have changed India forever
 soochna tak pahunch ne janaakankshaon ko kaaphi badha diya he or saamaan tathaa sevaaon tak pahunch ne un aakankshaon ko puraa karne main madad kii he
 The slogan of inclusive development has left a deep impact on the psyche of the people and everyone wants a share in its fruits
 log apni aakankshaon ko puraa karne ke liye avasar chaahate hai, na ki maai-baap sarkaar se khayraat
 Farmers want uninterrupted supply of electricity, not free electricity
 khayraat garibi rekha ke neeche rahane vaali aabaadi tak simit rahani chahie kyonki unhen kalyankari rajya kii madad kii jarurat he
 As far as the politics front is concerned, the mandate has been known for inadvertent stability
 yah baat lambey samay se spasht thi ki apane boote satta ke kareeb pahunchane kii icchhuk party ko hindi kshetra main kisi bhi surat main acha pradarshan karnaa hoga
 The region was captured by regional parties by sitting on the basis of caste, sub-caste and religion
 darasal, unhone baanto or raaj karo kaa khel khelaa
 Dekhdekhi national parties also became involved in such sports
 unka charitra kshetreey partiyon se bahut bhinn nahin tha
 It gained political power, but the status of Hindi-speaking states remained the same
 uttar pradesh or bihar main vikaas naam kii cheez gaayab thi
 The Congress was forced to contest elections alone in these states, which proved to be a boon for him
 rahul gandhi ke jabardast chunaav abhiyaan or bahuprachaarit tathaa suniyojit 'bharat khoj yatra' ne congress ke paksh main kaam kiya
 The National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGA) and the Kisan loan waiver scheme received the maximum attention and were widely publicized in the UPA policies
 to kya iskaa arth yah he ki kshetreey raajnneeti yaa avasarwaadi raajnneeti ke din lad rahe hai? katai nahin
 If you look at the results of Uttar Pradesh, it will become clear that the bsp's vote percentage has increased and the Congress has benefited from the loss of BJP
 sapa ko bhi uttar pradesh main chuki hui takat nahin mana ja saktaa
 In Maharashtra, the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) has been breaching the Shiv Sena vote bank, due to which the Congress gained six-seven seats there
 pashchim bengal main kshetreey party trinmul congress kii jeet hui
 There is no hope of improving the Congress position there
 kerala main vamapanthiyon kaa vot pratishat pehle kii tarah bana hua he, lekin bhaajapa ke vot pratishat main kami ai, jiskaa phayda congress ko mila
 a trend in these elections was probably that voters ignored the allegiance to the party and voted for the winnable candidate of their interest groups
 kshetreey partiyon main vam morcha, rajd or sapa ko badi sankhya main siten ganvaani padin
 And the issues related to the respective state played an important role in this damage
 inamen se zyaadaatar mudde shashan or kanoon-vyavastha se sambandhit the
 Resentment from the government is not an issue
 i believe that Indian voters have been giving this message more than the end of regional politics for some time that good governance matters only to whoever the government is
 janvari 2009 main sielese kii ek report main hamane likhaa tha, ''2008 main rajyon main hue chunaavon se yah spasht sanket mila ki sarkaar se naaraazgi ab koi mudda nahin he
 It seems — and it has been proved from time to time — that ruling governments win elections because of their good performance and strong local leadership
 agar yah rujhaan jari rahaa to isse bhartiya loktantr kaa bhala hoga
 "delhi, Gujarat, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa and Chhattisgarh clearly give this message
 main is saal farvari main raibareli main kuch bhaajapa samarthakon se mila jinhone kaha ki ve congress ko vot denge
 On asking the reason, he said that employment will be created by setting up a rail coach factory here
 yahaan tak ki bihar main bhi, jahaan nitish kumaar kii lokapriyata badhati hi ja rahi he, yadi congress-rajd-lojpa ne chunaav-purv gathbandhan ke maatahat ladaa hota to nattejey kuch or nikal sakate the
 In Andhra Pradesh, the Congress's vote share remained in place, though it had fielded candidates in several states
 andhra pradesh main antar yah tha ki kshetreey partiyon ke vot vibhajit ho gaye the or chiranjeevi kii praja rajyam party ne tedepa kaa khel bigaadane kaa kaam kiya
 Extremist politics in Indian democracy — whether of leftists or rightists — is irrelevant
 isliye bhaajapa or vamapanthiyon ko abhi bahut kuch siikhnaa he
 This may sound a bit hypothetical as it may please liberal observers
 shivasena, maharashtra navnirmaan sena or communiston ke vot pratishat darshaate hai ki yahaan ativaadee vichaaron ke bhi samarthak hai
 Consider the emergence of AUDF in some parts of Assam
 kattarpanthi vichaar bhale hi haashie par hon, lekin ve bharat ke bahultavaadi samaaj or rajyatantr ke liye khatarnaak hai
 Undoubtedly, the BJP has to consider that a right-wing centrist party can be formed without polarizing India
 in chunaavon kaa samay kisi bhi vipakshi party ke liye phydemand hona chahie tha, lekin bhaajapa ne ghalmail kar diya or vah phayda nahin uthaa saki
 Mandate for governance and reforms The stock market reacted as expected when the Congress received a decisive mandate in the elections
 saath hi is baat kii ummid bhi badi kii ki bharat ke niti-nirmaataa aarthik sudhaaron ko phir patari par laaenge
 To regain the pace of India's growth and bring the economy on a strong path of growth, we must strictly implement reforms both in terms of economy and governance
 agar ham ateet kii baat karen to sudhaaron ko lagu karnaa aasaan nahin tha
 As far as the present is concerned, it will still not be easy to implement reforms, especially given the current global environment
 yahaan yah baat gauratlab he ki udaaravaadi pranali main poonjeevaad or shoshan kii adhikta se tamaam tarah ke sawaal khadey ho rahe hai
 The consolidated financial deficit / gross domestic product (which includes regional and off-balance products such as oil, fertilizers and cereals) increased by 11 percent in the 2009 fiscal year
 iskaa kaaran yah he ki halke kar se hone vaale rajasav or ucch saamaajik kharch, sarkari karmchaariyon ke vetan main vruddhi, kisaan rin maafee or sabsidi ko aapas main jod diya gaya he
 We see that the deficit for FY 2010 remains at an earlier level, 3 to the government to meet
 1 lakh karod ru
 Have to borrow philhal, sarkaar ke udhaar lene kii yojana kaa byaaj dar par simit prabhaav padaa he kyonki nijee kshetra main rin kii maang girane, nitigat daron main katautee, bhartiya rigerv bank dwaara market stabiligeshan skim (emesas) bonds shuru karne or mudrasfiti main lagbhag shunya pratishat kii vruddhi se uski bharpai ho gai he
 But if a lax attitude was adopted to overcome the fiscal deficit, the income from the bonds would decline as demand for private loans and WPI inflation would start rising from the second half of FY10
 iske alaava, samaayojansheel maudrik niti ko ulatney kii kisi bhi sambhaavna se sheyaron main giravat aa jaaegi
 As the economy has collapsed due to the global recession, the government will face difficulties in raising money for some of its populist schemes
 kya manmohan singh acha shashan de sakenge or aarthik sudhaar lagu kar sakenge? yaa phir ve bharat dwaara 1991 ke baad apanaai gai aarthik nitiyon ko lekar kshamayachak vaali mudra apanaayenge?upie adhyaksh or congress supremeo sonia gandhi ne kaha he ki indira gandhi kii bainkon ke rashtriyakaran kii niti ne bhartiya vitt pranali ko bachaa liya he
 Reading the election manifesto of Congress in 2009 did not raise much hope
 iske baavjood, chunaav ghoshnapatron ko bahut adhik tarjeeh nahin di jaani chahie
 If the Congress does not consider the mandate as a 'break away from the cat's fate', but gives its credit to its populist policies and inefficient governance of the last five years, then this happiness will soon be vindicated
 bharat ke log, chaahe ve kisi bhi saamaajik-aarthik str ke hon, pragati ke avasar or khel ke barabari vaale maidan kii khoj main hai

 Narendra Modi's name is well known for the post of Prime Minister from the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the Lok Sabha elections 2019
 lekin congress samet tamaam partiyaan piem pad kaa cheharaa saarvajanik karne se hichak rahi hai
 Though inside is a face race among all the big and small parties, they also feel that anything is possible in manipulative politics and if given a chance, the chair of the PM can also join hands
 darasal, bhartiya janata party kaa bhi vipaksh se sawaal hota he ki unka piem pad ke liye cheharaa koun he? khaskar congress se yah sawaal poocha jaataa he, haalanki congress main rahul gandhi ko lekar party main koi matbhed nahin he, lekin party naam saarvajanik karne se bachati rahi he
 At the same time, big faces of all regional parties including BSP chief Mayawati, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamat Banerjee, Sharad Pawar, Arvind Kejriwal are eyeing the pm's chair
 lekin bada sawaal he ki narendra modi ke mukaable main vipaksh kaa sabase bada cheharaa he koun, jo 2019 main kadi chunauti de saken
 Aaj Tak has tried to find the pulse of the public through Karvy Insights
 aakhir jis narendra modi ko vipaksh satta se hataane kii baat kar rahaa he, uske vikalp ke taur par vipaksh ke paas sabase bada lokapriy cheharaa koun he
 The survey asked who is the biggest face of the Prime Minister's post for 2019 as an alternative to Narendra Modi? The answer we got in the survey is a big relief for the Congress
 haalanki survey main kai kshetreey dalon ke pramukhon kaa bhi naam bhi piem pad ke daavedaar ke taur par ubharkar saamne aayaa he
 According to the survey conducted in January 2019, 52 percent people consider Rahul Gandhi as the claimant of the post of PM from the opposition as an alternative to Narendra Modi
 iske alaava mamata banerjee ko 8 fisadi, priyanka gandhi ko 5 fisadi, pi chidambaram ko 5 fisadi, akhilesh yadav ko 5 fisadi or arvind kejariwal ko bhi 5 fisadi log vipaksh kii ore se 2019 main piem pad ke daavedaar maanate hai
 While Mayawati wants to see 3 per cent, Sharad Pawar 2 per cent and just one per cent of people Chandrashekhar Rao on the pm's chair in 2019
 survey main ek aankada congress ke paksh main jaataa dikh rahaa he
 When the same question was raised in August 2016, 23 per cent considered Rahul as an alternative to PM Modi
 uske baad se lagaataar rahul gandhi kaa graph badha he
 In August 2018, 46 per cent considered Rahul as an alternative to Modi, while in January this figure has reached 52 per cent
 vahiin farvari 2016 main 10 fisadi log mayawati ko vipaksh kii ore se narendra modi kaa vikalp maanate the, lekin ab ye aankada girakar 3 fisad ho gaya he
 In this survey, a picture has become clear that the people of the country consider Rahul Gandhi as the biggest face in the opposition as an alternative to PM Modi
 yahi nahin, pichley teen saalon main rahul gandhi kii daavedaari or majboot hui he, or yah congress ke liye acha sanket he

 centre sarkaar ne saafe kiya he ki pushtaini gahanon par iskar vasuulne kaa uskaa koi iraadaa nahin he
 There is no such thing in the new tax proposals
 yahi nahin ghar main mili sone par mahilaon ke haq kaa bhi khyaal rakhaa gaya he lekin kai logon ke saamne kai sawaal hai
 Savita, working in a central government office, got married 20 years ago
 shaadi ke vaqt maayke or sasuraal se gahane bhi mili lekin wo ye nahin samaj paa raheen ki wo kaise sabit karengi ki ye pushtaini gahane hai
 Savita told NDTV, "I don't have the bill for the ornaments my father-in-law gave
 main kaise sabit karuungi ki mere paas jo gahanaa he wo pushtaini he?" In fact, the government has tried to stop the rumor that it will also tax ancestral ornaments
 usne ye saafe kiya he ki nae kanoon main pushtaini gahanon par tex lagane kaa koi prastaav nahin he or is bare jo afvaahen faili hai wo bebuniyaad hai or isamen koi tathy nahin he
 The comments yahi nahin, ghoshit aay se khride sone par bhi koi tex nahin he
 Apart from this, married women can keep 500 grams of gold
 avivaahit mahilaon ko 250 gram sone par chhot milegi
 While men will be able to keep up to 100 grams of gold without tax
 magar savita kii tarah duusari mahilaayein bhi hai jo yahi puch rahi hai ki pehle mili gahanon kii raseed wo kahaan se laaengi
 In fact, gold is the oldest and reliable means of saving in Indian homes
 ho saktaa he, sarkaar ke is elaan se sabko raahat mili lekin logon ke man main kuch sawaal bhi hai
 The Finance Ministry issued clarifications to put an end to the rumor regarding the taxation of gold ancestral ornaments, but it has raised many new questions in the minds of common people
 ab dekhnaa hoga ki sarkaar in sawaalon se aane vaale dinon main kaise nipatati he

 Not only this, there is no tax on gold purchased from declared income
 iske alaava vivaahit mahilaayein 500 gram sona rakh sakengi
 Unmarried women will get a discount on 250 grams of gold
 jabaki purush 100 gram tak sona bina tex ke rakh sakenge
 But like Savita, there are other women who are asking where they will get the receipt of the jewels found earlier
 darasal bhartiya gharon main sona bachat kaa sabase purana or bharosemand jariya he
 Maybe, this announcement of the government will bring relief to all, but there are some questions in the mind of the people
 sona ke pushtaini gahanon par tex lagane ko lekar uthi afvaah ko khatm karne ke liye vitt mantralay ne spashtikaran jari kiye lekin isane aam logon ke man main kai nae sawaal khadey kar die hai
 Now it has to be seen how the government deals with these questions in the coming days

 So Reema Lagoo has played the role of mother of almost every superstar of Bollywood in films
 chaahe 'kal ho na ho' main shahrukh khan kii maa kaa kirdaar ho yaa phir film 'araju' main akshay ke saath najar ain hon or yaa 'vastav' main sanjay dutt kii maa, rima lagu ne har film main 'maa' ke kirdaar ko ek alag aayam die hai
 But even then, the chemistry of his and Salman Khan's chemistry was a sight to behold
 ek samay aisa tha jab log rima lagu ko hi salmaan khan kii maa samajhane lage the
 In such a situation, as soon as the news of Reema Lagoo's demise came in the early morning on Thursday, everyone remembered Salma Khan's 'mother' Reema
 rima lagu ke nidhan kii khabar sunate hi soshal media par logon ko onscreen 'maa-bete' kii yah superhit jodi yaad aa gai
 Talking about their films, Salman and Reema were seen in the film Main Maine Pyar Kiya, which was a superhit
 uske baad 'pathar ke phool', phir 'saajan', 'ham saath-saath' hai or 'judawaan' main yah donon maa-bete ke kirdaar main najar aae
 In such a situation, the fans are also sharing a beautiful moment of this pair on social media
 darasal ek 15 second ke video main salmaan khan rima lagu ko dekhte hue unhen gale lagaate or unase pyaar se milte najar aa rahe hai
 Probably the last time they met each other
