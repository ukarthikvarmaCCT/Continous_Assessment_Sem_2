 You have seen the commercials that keep airing between TV shows, taken a good look at the hoardings put up in public places and have gone through full-page ads in newspapers
 You are now almost certain that you need life insurance
 While that’s definitely a good decision, it makes sense to step back for some time before taking the plunge
 Life insurance is a critical part of financial planning and has long-term repercussions
 Besides, the security of your family also depends on it
 So be prudent and ask yourself some pertinent questions before buying a life insurance
 Doing so will help you approach insurance with more clarity
 We quickly take you through the list of questions you should be asking yourself
 -- ‘what is my financial objective?’once you have decided that you need life insurance, list out your present and prospective financial objectives which have contributed to this decision
 Do you need it for your children's education or for the security of your spouse? It becomes easier to select a policy when your objectives are clear
 You know what you are getting into and what to expect from it
 If your objectives are not clear, you might end up buying the wrong policy under misguided notions
 -- ‘how much insurance do i need?’calculate your current and projected financials before buying a policy
 This will ensure that in case of any unfortunate incident, the financial security of your family is not threatened
 Your children can continue with their education without any hindrance and your spouse will not face monetary troubles
 - 'what kind of insurance policy should i buy?' It is advisable to do a little research on your own on the types of policies available and how they function
 This will help you select a policy that fits your requirements
 For example: If you are looking for a policy that provides returns at regular intervals, choose a money-back plan
 Likewise, if you want a policy that gives you a lumpsum amount at the end of a specified term, go in for an endowment plan
 - 'how much am i willing to pay?' To service a life insurance policy and reap its benefits in the long run, you have to pay a specific amount at regular intervals
 This amount is called premium
 If you do not pay the premium on time, there are chances the policy may lapse
 As a result, select a policy with a premium amount that matches your earning capacity
 - 'how many policies should i buy?' There is no cap on the number of policies you can buy
 As life stages change, your financial requirements change too
 So it is essential for you to review your life insurance plan from time to time
 In order to meet future financial commitments, you may feel the need to buy additional insurance policies
 Let us assume you have a life insurance policy that you had bought before marriage
 After getting married and having a child, you may want to plan for your child’s future well in advance
 This is when you can buy an additional policy that will help you build a corpus over a period of time
 So once your child grows up, you can use the insurance amount as planned
 Once you have the answers to all your questions, go ahead and buy a life insurance policy
 Reach out to reliable companies likebharti AXA Lifethat have a wide suite of plans for you
 Be it affordable term insurance plans or monthly income plans, the company has a diverse range of solutions that fit your requirements
 There is also an online term insurance plan, eprotect that offers tax return and family care benefit along with a smooth claims process
 Life insurance helps you financially protect your family
 But the buying process starts with asking the right questions which can help you make better choices! Based on Vijay's complaint, Manju was arrested by the police on the same day

 jammu-kashmir main bijepi-pidipi ke gathbandhan ne sabko hairat main daal diya
 Ideally, the Valley has not been away from the news even for a day after the alliance of these two parties on opposite ground
 mufti sarkaar kii gatividhiyon par modi sarkaar safai dete nahin thak rahi he
 In such a situation, the big question is how much this alliance will survive
 sawaalh kya bijepi or pidipi kii shaadi ghati main nayaa mausam laaegi yaa ye shaadi kuch hi vakt kii raajnneetik sahuuliyat he
 i would not call it marriage
 47 se ab tak bahut shaadi hui hai
 Marriage is between two people or families
 ye vyaktigat cheez hoti he
 Whether it is to enjoy power
 magar pidipi ke maamle main aisa nahin he
 Even during the last alliance with the Congress, we thought for a month
 ham partnership chaahate the,aisi ki jisase jammu kashmir ke logon ko kuch mili
 Common minimum program was found for this
 logon kaa purnvas, pakistan ke saath baat, raajnneetik bandiyon kii rihaai
 It was all positive
 us vakt centre main vaajapeyi ji ke netritv vaali endie sarkaar thi
 At that time, Mufti Saheb adopted a healing policy
 cracdown, pota khatm kar diya
 But when Atal ji saw the ground situation during the Kashmir visit
 indira gandhi ke baad yah pehla aisa daura tha, jab PM ko kaale jhande nahin dikhaai die
 Shops closed
 atal bole ham pakistan se baat karen, insaaniyat ke daayre main baat hogi
 That is why i repeatedly say that Mufti Saheb's Healing Touch Policy is the only solution
 sawaalh kya modi vaajapeyi ho sakate hai
 Will you give the same advice to Modi? Answer: BJP has come a long way after that
 vah vikaas kii raajnneeti ke raste par pehle hi chal chuke hai
 Our alliance is also on this basis
 chaahe vah jammu kashmir ke special states kii baat ho yaa kuch or
 Narasimha Rao said in 1995-96 of the Congress
 ski ij da limit autonomi ke maamle main
 Now the same Congress are surrounded by BJP
 aap samajhie, ham jammu kashmir main maahaul badalane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 Help in this sawaalh pichley saal aapane kaha tha bijepi ke saath gathbandhan nahin
 They do divisive politics
 gujjar banaam baniyaa
 Muslim vs Hindu
 kashmir banaam jammu
 And now you are with me
 Answer: It is a matter of understanding the mandate, not of desire
 us rajya main sanvaidhanik santhaaon ko, chune hue pratinidhiyon ko kaam karne kaa bharpoor mauka nahin mila
 We sat down and understood the mandate
 do vikalp the
 Go with one, Congress, NC
 yaa phir bijepi ke saath jaaen hamane bahut vichaar ke baad bijepi ko chunaa
 Why kyonki hamen puure desh kaa jammu kashmir ke prati mindset badalanaa tha
 We had to think of the whole state, not just the valley
 isliye hamane gathbandhan kiya or ek kaaman program tay kiya
 Question: Common minimum program is based on trust
 vah to dikh hi nahin rahaa
 Masrat Alam was released
 chunaav ke safal hone kaa credit hurriyat or pakistan ko diya gaya
 BJP is getting angry on all this
 jawaab- isiilie maine partnership kaha, marij nahin
 How many people present here knew that Jammu and Kashmir had been a state flag from the beginning
 aaj is par vivaad ho rahaa he
 As if Mufti Sahab came yesterday and the flag was replaced with a new one
 aapako to khush hona chahie ki is gathbandhan ke bahaane desh ko us rajya ke bare main pataa chal rahaa he
 The sovereignty of the country has always been paramount
 isiilie vahaan tirangaa he
 When i talk about Mindset, do not distribute it in the groove of hindu-muslim
 ye dashakon se kai vichaaron dwaara taiyaar kiya gaya he
 India's democracy is the greatest
 supreme court jaisi sanstha he
 But you also selectively tell his instructions
 jab court afjal guru ko faansee detaa he to kanoon he
 When the same court talks about the release of Masrat Alam, there is chaos
 sawaalh kya chintaa hoti he
 After releasing Masrat, the hash tag on Twitter said that Mufti Mohammad Saeed is pro Pakistan
 is soch ko kaise counter karenge
 Answer: Why should such a situation arise in Jammu and Kashmir that even a single Masrat Alam has to be sent to jail
 aap samajhie ki ye sarkaar kya karnaa chaah rahi he
 It is trying to stop the youth from going the path of separatism
 afvaah or asuraksha kaa maahaul khatm karnaa chaah rahi he
 Some mps were shouting in Rajya Sabha
 mufti 10 hajaar kaidiyon ko reeha karne vaale hai
 There are 16 prisioners in total
 usamen sirf do pathar phenkane vaale hai
 If we cannot bring Jammu and Kashmir back into the mainstream
 raahat nahin de sakate
 Then what is the use of politics and staying in power? meri khwaahish to ye thi ki masarat alam relies hota or log is par charchaa karte ki is desh main yah mumkin he ki rajya kii galati ko court durust kar saktaa he
 Masrat Alam may not have said this publicly, but people would have said
 dekhie is desh main nyaay he
 Is it wrong to follow the directions of the Supreme Court? nahin na, to hamane kaise galat kiya
 Question: Do Kashmiri Pandits also come under the purview of Healing Touch
 kashmiri panditon kii samuhik hatya karne vaale khuleam gum rahe hai
 Not one such killer was punished
 unka kya karengi
 Answer: First thing, i am not here to defend Masrat Alam
 jab 2010 main 125 log maare gaye, tab centre main ek report ai thi, jisamen kaha gaya tha ki congress sarkaar ne halaat ko thik se nahin samajha
 Masrat is the result of those mistakes
 steriotip sirf kashmiriyon ke saath hi nahin he
 Many of our Sikh brothers face racial attacks in America
 magar kuch gut hai, jo khud ko muslim kehete hai or aatanki ghatnaon ko anjaam dete hai
 Because of them we are questioned
 main issis par sharminda hum
 Shame on the Taliban who destroyed the Buddha statue in Bamiyan
 main har us shaks kii ninda karti hum jo bandook ke sahare solution khojataa he
 Whether it is a fake encounter or a terrorist
 sawaalh aap kashmiri panditon ke sawaalon par jawaab nahin de raheen
 Bitta Karate killed dozens of Kashmiris
 kya un par ritrial hoga?javaabah hamaare gathbandhan ke kaaman program main kashmiri panditon ko raahat purnvas kii baat he
 My childhood was spent in the lap of Kashmiri Pandits
 mere bacchon ko nahin pataa
 Talking about cases like Bitta Karate, he is in jail
 or aise kai cese hai
 But the charges against him could not be proved
 court main maamle tik nahin paae
 Whether it is Bitta Karate or people killed in fake encounter
 un sabko justise kii jarurat he
 Question: What will you do about tourism? Answer: This issue is very close to my father's heart
 papa rajeev gandhi sarkaar main tourism ministar the
 We are improving the infrastructure
 nai jagahen taiyaar kar rahe hai
 Apart from this, we are trying to engage the tourist more
 ek saal kaa vakt dijie
 Things will look changed
 sawaal: ghati main yuvaao ke liye cinemaghar nahin he, cafe nahin hai wo shaam main kahaan jaaen?jawaab: hamaare vakt bahut chijen thim
 We used to go to college to watch movies
 magar aaj aisa nahin he
 We will work for it
 ham bhi chaahate hai ki ghati main cafe hon, macdonald kii food chen ho, multiplex hon
 After six years you will not be able to make these complaints
 main khud maikdi freeq hum
 Question: How did Article 370 help Kashmir
 ye puure desh ke saath integrat nahin ho paaya
 Answer: This is a misunderstanding about 370
 jammu kashmir kii jameen bharat kaa hi hissaa he na
 Then
 ye kaisaa phobia he
 It is an emotional issue for the people of Jammu and Kashmir
 aapako unki takalif samajni hogi
 i also feel sad that when an army soldier dies
 magar jab ek 11 saal kaa baccha sena kii goli kaa shikaar hota he, tab bhi to utana hi dukh hona chahie
 i repeatedly said that these innocents should be killed
 inamen ek bhi aatankwaadi hota, to main siyasat chhod detii
 Question: Will Modi be able to win the heart of PDP like Vajpayee
 modi or vaajapeyi kii abhi tulana thik nahin
 Vajpayee's politics and understanding developed over the decades
 modi ji ko abhi ek saal hi hua he
 Yet he has shown heart in the case of the valley
 samaj dikhaai he
 Political profit has held back losses
 puure desh ne unhen janadesh diya he
 So why should we not believe them? darasal amanmani treepathi ko elahabaad hoicourt ne zamaanat di thi, jiske khilaaf sibiai or sara kii maa seemaa singh ne supreme court main yachika daakhil kii he
 Amanmani's wife Sara Singh died on July 9, 2015 under suspicious circumstances, in which case Sara Singh's mother Seema Singh filed a murder case against Amanmani and the CBI has filed a charge sheet investigating the case

 There is no dearth of praise for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's decision on demonetisation, saying it is good for the country
 vahiin kuch aise bhi hai jo notebandi se aam logon ko hone vaali dikkaton ko lekar faisle kii aalochana bhi kar rahe hai
 But the person we are going to tell you here, that is, Mohammed Anees, is a big fan of Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself
 peshey se silaai mashiinon ke export maikenic hai lekin inkaa dil painting main ramata he
 Mohammad Anees himself has also been impressed by the decision on demonetisation but he has the same respect for Modi as before
 piem modi ke hai muridamohammad anis kaa daawa he ki jab se narendra modi desh ke pradhanmantri bane, tabhi se wo unke mureed ho gaye
 Anis was so convinced of the Prime Minister's personality that he decided to make his paintings
 kareeb dhai maheene main anis ne bade jatan or lagan se pradhanmantri kii painting banaai
 In this, he left no stone unturned to portray Modi's influential personality
 anis ko ummid thi ki ye painting haathon-haath bik jaaegi or unki mehnat kaa acha inaam milegaa
 According to the billions of crores, it was seen that he sent pictures of paintings to many influential people, including politicians, businessmen, through social media and whatsapp
 anis kaa daawa he ki painting kii keemat karodon main lagani bhi shuru ho gai
 But then the decision on demonetisation came on 8 November
 iske baad sab badal gaya
 According to Anees, along with demonetisation, the sale of his painting also fell into ruin
 pehle jo log painting kharidne main dilchaspee dikhaa rahe the, ab unhone apane haath peeche khinch liye
 Anees is praying that the situation that has happened due to the ban on demonetisation should be normalized as soon as possible and the way for the sale of his painting should also be opened

 While giving a clarification on this issue, the team of doctors said that there was some technical mistake in the figures which were revealed last time
 dow
 Praveen Solanki told that there has been no increase in Hardik's weight
 doctor ne bataaya ki hardik kaa vajan kabhi 20 KG gata hi nahin tha, vah sirf 13 KG hi gata tha
 So now when the checkup is done, Hardik's weight has come to 65 KG
 bataa den ki doctoron ne hardik patel ko salaah di he, ki vah turant aspataal main bhartee ho jaaen
 However, Hardik continues to deny this

 ise samar olympic ke naam se janaa jaataa he Armed crooks in the capital Lucknow escaped on Thursday by robbing gold worth lakhs of rupees from the branch of Muthoot Gold Finance Company
 police philhal maamle main koi giraftaar nahin kar saki he
 According to the police, at around 9:30 am, seven masked armed miscreants entered the branch of Muthoot Finance in Alambagh in the capital and took hostages and escaped by looting gold worth lakhs of rupees
 lakhanu ke police adheekshak (purvi) rajesh kumaar ne kaha ki badmaash jate vakt sisitivi footage bhi apane saath le gaye
 He said that by looking at the blockade of the city, the miscreants are being searched
 philhal kisi kii giraftaar nahin ho saki he
 Police say that the value of gold was looted at present
 ashanka he ek karod rupee se zyada keemat kaa sona lutaa gaya
 The scope of government restrictions around the world is also changing and their circle is also tightening
 dharna-pradarshan yaa andolan karnaa mushkil hota ja rahaa he
 Voice suppression has become easier
 bhale hi asahmati ke swar kii sankhya lakhon main ho magar ab yah sambhav he or ho bhi rahaa he ki pehle kii tulana main inhen aasaani se dabaa diya jaataa he, khaskar tab jab kaha jaataa he ki soochna ke bahut saare madhyam ho gaye hai
 Internet and social media are done
 lekin isi daur main sarkaar achaanak internet seva thapp kar detii he
 Smartphones become useless and you go back to the public booth in a jolt in the era ie fifty years before today
 duniya bhar main nazar ghumaayiye, sena or police kii krurta pehle se kahin zyaada sakht or durust he
 It has to be debated whether technology has expanded our democracies or made them easy to be crushed
 dilli main ravidaas mandir tode jane kii ghatana ko lekar punjab ke kuch shahar main pradarshan hue, band hua
 Closed in Gurudaspur, Hoshiarpur, Jalandhar and Kapurthala
 yani bahut saare log sadakon par nikle honge lekin uski kahin koi khoj khabar nahin
 Frustrated, people started calling channels as to why there was no coverage of our performance
 aae din rajyon se sarkari bhartee ko lekar pradarshan hote rahete hai, laathiyaan chalati rahati hai magar channelon tak khabaren nahin pahunch paatin
 Whether you are five thousand or five lakh in number, you are zero in a round in which the number of channels has become thousand
 technalji ke kaaran ab yah mumkin he ki pradarshan main shaamil har kisi kii pahchaan kii ja sakati he, soshal media se unke post uthaakar unki raajnneeti kaa nakshaa samajha ja saktaa he, andolan kii aahat milte hi kuchalane yaa shant karne kii taiyaari pukhta kii ja sakati he
 It has become impossible to agitate
 sarkaron ne aise kanoon bana liye hai ki maamuli pradarshan main shaamil hone ke baad bhi rashtravirohi gatividhiyon main shaamil hone ke aarope main giraftaar kiye ja sakate hai
 It is the media era but the news in the media is second
 sau channel hai, magar sabakaa ek hi propeganda he jise angrezi main agenda kehete hai
 The one who is opposing is opposing the government and the country
 deshadroh kar rahaa he
 We have to understand why the obsolescence is becoming redundant
 kyon andolan mushkil hote ja rahe hai
 Why control over every possibility of movement has become more strict than ever
 loktantr kii batti internet ke switch par tik gai he
 The switch happened that you were cut off
 is sawaal ko aap vahaan bhi dekhie jahaan kashmir he or vahaan bhi jahaan kashmir nahin he
 So, we will talk about Hong Kong
 hong kong ke pradarshnon kii khabar hamaare channelon main speed news main dikhti he lekin duniya ke kai akhabaaron main is andolan kii ranneetiyon ko lekar khub likhaa ja rahaa he
 The Hong Kong movement is showing how the police and the state can now control people better than before and people can challenge this control
 hong kong ke andolan main state yani rajya kii akut takat ko chunauti kii kahani he
 Every student who believes in democracy should study Hong Kong movement
 11 hafte se hong kong main pradarshan ho rahe hai
 Hong Kong had been a colony of Britain for 150 years
 1984 main britain or china ke bich ek deal hui ki 1997 se hong kong china kaa hissaa banegaa lekin usase pehle 50 saal tak vahaan ek mulk, do system lagu hoga
 In 50 years, 2047, Hong Kong will be fully merged with China
 tab tak ke liye hong kong ke paas raksha or videsh maamalon ko chhod saare adhikaar rahane the
 But due to Chinese interference in the Hong Kong legislature, many laws were made that people there did not like
 unka kahana he ki unke loktantric adhikaron kii katautee hoti ja rahi he
 There were protests from time to time, but they were crushed
 hong kong ke paas abhivyakti kii azaadi he, jamaa hone kii azaadi he, apana legal system he
 Economic policy is also its own
 magar pichley dinon yahaan ek kanoon banataa he ki agar koi vyakti aise aparaadh main pakadaa jaataa he jis par hong kong ke kanoon ke tahat karrwai nahin ho sakati to unhen china bhej diya jayega
 There was apprehension among the people that they would be sent to China using this law
 june ke maheene se hi is kanoon ke khilaaf pradarshan hone lage
 But our focus is not on the issue between Hong Kong and China, but on the demonstrations and methods taking place there
 hong kong ke andolankariyon ne andolan kii samaj badal di he
 His preparation, his clothes and the use of technology are telling how difficult the future movement will be
 hong kong ke andolankariyon ne jo tarika nikaala he kya wo aaj kii sarkaron par dabaav daalane ke liye paryaapt he, yaad rakhie, sarkaron ke paas technalji ke kaaran lakhon kii bheed par niyantran karne kaa tarika he
 If she wants, she can make the network of millions of people disappear, a few thousand and even the network of any one
 aap achaanak duniya se lekar apane aas paas se cat jaaenge
 Therefore said that every student of democracy should study Hong Kong's performance, not Hong Kong's, its future
 jaise vahaan kii police jab andolankariyon se muqabla karne aati he to uske paas ek hai definishan camera hota he jo jhat se chehre kii tasviir letaa he or sara record baahar kar detaa he
 You can see that there is a man standing in the middle of the police personnel who has a camera
 pradarshan main shaamil chehre kii tasviir lee ja rahi he taaki pataa lagaaya ja sake ki ye koun hai
 Once identified, then it will be easy for the police to separate from the crowd
 is camere kii madad se police pradarshan main shaamil logon ko tod sakati he
 May torture them separately
 magar pradarshnakariyon ne iskaa bhi jawaab nikaala he
 When they get close to the police, they keep the laser on
 hare or nile rang ke leisure kii kirane camere ko kanfus kar detii hai
 The camera lens goes bad
 tasviir saaf nahin hoti he
 How much the world has changed
 hong kong kii police ne kaha he ki leisure kirnon se ankhon ko nuksaan pahonchega, sharir ke chamade ko bhi nuksaan hoga isliye iskaa istamaal na karen
 We read about the facial recognition camera on the CBC website, which states that this camera, after taking a picture, tells how the mood of the protester is, what is his identity, what will the face look like without a beard and with a beard, What else is speaking, he can also catch
 aise camere aane vaale dinon main pradarshan karnaa mushkil kar denge to aise leisure bhi hai jo camere ke saath khadi police ko mushkil main daal sakate hai
 This laser is so dangerous that the police demonstrated it in front of the media that by putting laser rays on white paper for too long, the paper can burn
 helicopter yaa hawaii jahaaz ko nuksaan pahunchaa saktaa he
 Now the police are arresting those who are buying laser torch
 police sade libaas main bazaar main leisure pointer kareedne waalon ko giraftaar kar rahi he
 We got a CNBC report about this
 may 2019 kii
 In which it has been told that there are about 200 million cameras in China, which can identify someone's face
 koun chori kar rahaa he se lekar class main koun sa baccha so rahaa he, har koi pakad main aa jaataa he
 This report states that the face of the population of more than 1 billion is the data in a system which can extract the entire record in one stroke
 camera kisi ko dekhte hi second bhar main hi bataa degaa ki saamne vaala koun koun he, uskaa record kya he
 Governments have come to such control technology and we are oblivious to Hindu Muslims
 aane vaale vakt main technalji kis tarah kii chunautiyaan hamaare loktantr ke liye laa rahi he, uski parvaah hi nahin he
 That is why the police of Hong Kong are given high speed internet service so that their high definition camera can work faster
 yah hinsa kaa nayaa daur or rup he
 Police is committing violence with the camera
 pradarshnkaree kii pahchaan kar rahi he to pradarshnkaree leisure ke saath javaabi hinsa kar rahe hai
 If facial recognition and posts posted on social media have made it impossible to include in a demonstration, then the people of Hong Kong have cut it
 isliye kaha ki loktantr kaa bhavishya bagaiyr dharna pradarshan ke nahin ho saktaa he or dharna pradarshan kaa kya bhavishya he use samajhane ke liye hong kong ke pradarshnon kaa adhyayan karnaa hi hoga
 The protesters' tactics have attracted worldwide attention
 yah video to duniya bhar main charchit hua tha jab lakhon logon kii bheed ambulance kii awaz sunate hi kinare ho gai or ambulance nikal gaya
 This preparation of the protesters has shocked the world as to how this can be possible
 police kii nazar se bachane ke liye pradarshnkaree telegram kaa istamaal kar rahe hai jisamen suraksha agencia hastkshep nahin kar sakati hai
 The news came that a cyber attack has occurred on Telegram's server
 iske siio ne kaha ki hamalaa china se hua tha taaki hong kong ke log telegram par gupt baatcheet na kar saken
 Telegram is an app on which you can communicate like whatsapp
 aapako upar se sirf andolankaaree lagenge lekin isi main andolkariyon kii ek line he jo zarurat ke saamaan uplabdh karaati he
 It is told by hand that what is needed and the goods come from a distance of one mile as the line becomes longer
 agar ishaara hua helmet chahie to helmet aa jaataa he
 Pallets are shielded from garbage tins or household items to protect against guns and rubber bullets
 to ab police ke paas hi kaanch kii dhaal nahin he balki pradarshnakariyon ke paas bhi he
 The protesters are also equipped with all the clothes like police so that the injury is minimized
 aansu gas bujhane kii bhi kai logon ko training di gai he
 The tear gas falls and is then covered with a traffic cone or pour water before it bursts
 yah bhi niyam he ki kisi jagah par zyaada der tak nahin rahanaa he
 There are separate instructions for that too
 jiskaa ishaara hote hi bheed pal bhar main chant jaati he
 Like water has to come and pass
 cheharaa pahchaan main na aae isliye pradarshnakariyon ne apana cheharaa dhank liya he
 Using automatic intelligence, facial recognition is done, so to avoid this, we apply masks on the face
 yahaan tak ki sisitivi camere ko paint se pot diya gaya he
 You know that cameras are installed on every scene in every city, due to these it is now difficult to agitate
 kya technalji se hi jawaab dekar hong kong ke pradarshnkaree khud ko anaam or gupt rakh sakate hai
 Hong Kong protesters are astounding the world every day with their tactics
 pradarshnkaree apana naam nahin bataate hai
 They do not have a leader whom the police arrest and make the movement useless
 loktantr ke liye ladane vaale metro train main ek hi taraf kaa token lete hai
 So that it is not known who went from where
 ye log credit card kaa bhi istamaal nahin karte hai
 Neither selfies nor photographs are taken where they perform
 aise sim kaa istamaal karte hai jise ek baar istamaal karne ke baad phenkaa ja saktaa he
 People involved in the movement have deleted all types of apps from their smartphones
 chini soshal media vibo or ve chat kaa istamaal nahin kar rahe hai
 Someone is putting anything on Facebook
 2014 main andolankariyon ne bahut sari tasviren fasebuk par daali thim jiske kaaran giraftaaryaan hone lageen
 Much has been learned from the 2014 movement
 aapas main baatcheet ke liye nae code kaa istamaal ho rahaa he
 Instead of rally, use picnic
 mobile sarvice band ho jane ke kaaran apana ek ap banaaya he jiske zarie local level par baatcheet ho jaati he
 The movement in Hong Kong is telling that when the state's survey increases, its control increases then what will the people do, will they lose the existence of being their own people, you can be a public without demonstrations in democracy, i think you are not public Can occur
 hong kong international airport ke bheetar hazaron kii sankhya main pahunch gaye
 It is one of the largest airports in the world
 pichley shuukravaar ko airport ke aas paas chote samooh main pradarshan shuru hua lekin somvaar aate aate bheed badi ho gai
 The protesters knew that people from many countries of the world come to Hong Kong airport, so they prepared posters in many languages so that they could reach the world
 vahaan par yatriyon ke bich apana pamplett baantne lage
 In media era, people are adopting the trick of the era when there was no media
 soshal media ke bare main kaha jaataa he ki yah logon ko azaad karata he, loktantric banaata he magar ab yah soshal media sarkaron ke liye logon par niyantran ke kaam aa rahaa he
 So even though reports of Hong Kong's performance are on social media, there will be no trace of their preparations
 airport par bheed lagane ke kaaran saikadon kii sankhya main flite cancil kerani padi
 The airport is completely closed
 agar pradarshnkaree police ko chaka rahe hai, chakma de rahe hai to police bhi unhen chakma dene lagi he
 She is joining the crowd as a protestor and is going to arrest them
 is kaaran pradarshnakariyon main bechaini bad gai he
 The crowd is beginning to suspect that there is no policeman among them
 airport ke bheetar ghus aane ke kaaran is andolan ko duniya bhar main zyada jagah mili he
 Many countries have warned their citizens to avoid going to Hong Kong as the situation is tense
 loktantric adhikaron ko lekar logon kaa yah hujum bataa rahaa he ki badi takaton se muqabla aasaan nahin he
 Technology has shortened the lifespan of the movements
 unki safalataa ab mushkil ho gai he
 How long Hong Kong protesters can dodge government control through these routes
 soshal media ke naam par loktantr kaa jashn manaane se pehle iske khataron kii thik se samaj ho jaani chahie
 People turn their back on the question of privacy, tomorrow you will remember this question when you want to go on the road with the question of your rights but will not be able to go
 soshal media ke rah paaenge or na hi real media ke
 Everything is told in Hindi, hopefully you will not try to understand at all
 china jaisi sarkaar ke saamne kab tak ye saare prayog kaamyaab honge kaha nahin ja saktaa
 Hong Kong CEO says Hong Kong's economic future is in crisis due to the demonstration
 uski chhavi kharaab ho rahi he
 People are saying that they want democracy
 swaittata chahie
 Beijing says that this Hong Kong demonstration is a sign of terrorism
 sarkari media main inhen aatankwaadi ke taur par dikhaaya ja rahaa he

 The people of Seelampur assembly, who were troubled by power cuts especially during Sahri and Iftari, met Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday morning along with the MLA
 shikaayat ke baad maukey par pahunche kejarivalmangalvaar kii shaam 8 baje ke aasapaasmukhyamantri arvind kejarivalko bijli katautee kii shikaayat mili
 Arvind Kejriwal, with a team of Energy Minister Satyendar Jain and Energy Secretary Sukesh Jain, went to the lane number 8 on the Jaffarabad Road where the public alleged that power was cut off during Sahari and Iftari
 saamne aayaa kejariwal kaa exclusive videois dauraan BSES ke CEO ko arvind kejariwal ne ilaake main aane ke liye kaha
 After this, at around 8

 varsh 2002 tak peedit ladki ke taaoo, chachaa or pita se aaropee kuldeep singh senger kii khub banati thi
 Everyone had to come to each other's house
 2002 main jab kuldeep singh senger pehali baar vidhansabha kaa chunaav lard rahaa tha, tab peedit ladki ke taaoo, chachaa or pita ne senger ko chunaav main bharpoor madad kii thi
 But after becoming MLA for the first time, Kuldeep Singh Sengar suddenly started avoiding the three brothers
 iske baad donon pariwaron ke bich daraar padani shuru ho gai
 Gradually, this rift turned into a mutual rivalry
 isi bich gram pradhan kaa chunaav aa gaya
 Then the victim's tau decided to contest the election of Pradhani himself, to teach Sengar a lesson
 udhar, duusari taraf vidhayak senger kii maa chunni devi pradhani kaa chunaav lard rahi thim
 It was for the first time that the two families were face to face
 haalanki chunaav se ain pehle kuldeep singh senger ne peedita ke taaoo ke mukademon ko hathiyaar bana kar uski ummidavaari khaarij kara di thi
 Hence, instead of the victim's tau, the mother of his close Devendra Singh was removed in the election

 When the reporter from Pragati Maidan asked the autowale to walk to Dwarka, the answer came
 pragati maidan jaisi jagah par hamen trephic police vaala madad ke liye nahin mila
 But we were relieved to see the pre-paid booth

 Sony Razdan seems to have decided to end this chapter
 unhone kangana ranut or mahesh bhatta se judi apni ek post delit kar diya he
 Soni Razdan says that she does not want to enter into such madness
 soni razdan or rangoli ke bich twitor war actor randeep hooda ke twit se shuru hui
 Randeep Hooda, who has worked with Alia Bhatt on the highway, praised Aaliya on Twitter, saying, "dearest Aaliya, i am so happy that you can find yourself and your work with the thoughts of any carefree and constantly becoming an actress
 You are not allowed to be affected
 bahut khush hum khud ko behatar banane ke tumhaare lagaataar prayaason ke liye
 Alia also responded to this tweet by Randeep by making an emoji shortly after
 randeep ke twit par kangana kii bahan naaraaz ho gayi
 The reason for the resentment was that Randeep had courted Kangana with Alia's praise
 haalanki randeep ne kangana kaa naam nahin liya tha
 Rangoli Chandel wrote Randeep's class on Twitter, writing, "to save Alia Baby, the nepotism gang dared to do it for you or else, i know what you did during the shooting of the film Finger
 ""kitna haraas kiya tuune kangana ko or kitna bada chatukaar he tu karan johar kaa
 But still nothing happened to you

 mahesh bhatta ne use brake diya tha, wo lagaataar beti or patni par roj atake karti rahati hai
 Now what remains after such hateful things
 iske peeche kya agenda he? haalanki isi twit ko soni razdan ne baad main delit kar diya

 @soni_razdan— Rangoli Chandel (@rangoli_a)april 16, 2019rangoli ne soni razdan ke delit twit par jawaab dete hue likhaa, "dear soni ji, mahesh bhatta ne unhen (kangana ranut) ko kabhi brake nahin diya, balki anuraag basu ne diya tha
 Mahesh Bhatt ji was the only creative director in his brother's production house
 
 It was not his own production house
 rangoli ne likhaa, film 'wo lamhe' ke baad kangana ne unke saath film 'dhokhaa' main kaam karne se manaa kar diya tha kyonki usamen kangana ko ek suicide bombar kaa kirdaar nibhaana tha
 She played a lot on Kangana in her office, she was very sad about this
 lekin baad main wo film 'wo lamhe' ke privyuu ke liye gai thi or unhone us par chappal phenk kar maari thi
 She was not allowed to watch her own film

 nakli noton ke gorakhdhandhe main inke alaava ek nayaa naam saamne aa rahaa he
 This is the name of Paras, the spoiled prince of Nepal
 nakli noton ke ek bade saudagar maajid manihar ke bete vicky ne is baat ke sanket die hai ki nakli noton kii bharat main supplai ke taar paras se jude hai
 The mastermind of the fake currency business could be Paras son of Gyanendra, the former king of Parasnapal, whose actions are familiar to the whole world, not only the people of Nepal
 ab iskaa naam aa rahaa he bharat kii arthvyavastha kamjor karne kii sajeesh rachane main
 To supply consignment of counterfeit notes in India
 shaq he ki ye nepal main baitha paras nakli noton ke dhandhe kaa mastermind ho saktaa he
 Paras's name is on the tongue of Vicky Manihar, a dealer of fake notes of Nepal arrested in Bahraich in Uttar Pradesh
 sutron ke mutabik vicky manihar ne poochtacha main khulaasa kiya he ki paras ke taar iesai or nakli noton se jude ho sakate hai or paras ke saathi ke taur par nepal sarkaar ke purv mantri saleem miyaan siddiqui kaa bhi naam liya ja rahaa he
 This is the first time that a dealer of fake notes has pointed a finger at someone in the royal royal house of Nepal
 sutron ke mutabik vicky manihar kii haisiyat nakli noton ke chota don kii tarah he or yahi vajah he ki bhartiya suraksha agenciyon ke liye uskaa khulaasa ahmiyat rakhata he
 The royal house in Nepal helps
 Fake note traders Kovikki Manihar was arrested in Bahraich with fake notes and at that time he came to strengthen the network of agents of fake notes in India
 lekin baharich pahunchate hi police ke hathe chadh gaya
 The wire of fake currency is associated with the royal house of Nepal, this was known to the Indian intelligence agencies even before Vicky Manihar got on his tongue

 nepal main jaali noton ke dhandhe kaa master mind unuus ansaari he jo ki nepal ke purv mantri saleem ansaari kaa betaa he
 Salim Ansari, leader of the Nepali Samajwadi Party, was a cabinet minister during the reign of King Gyanendra
 itnaa hi nahin saleem ansaari kaa betaa unuus jo ab nepal main nakli noton ke puure dhandhe ko sambhalata he wo khud nepale ke purv rajkumaar paras kaa shagird he
 Salary Ansari and Yunus Ansari are the largest henchmen of d Company in Nepal and if anyone has helped the business to flourish, it is Nepal The former prince of Paras
 nepal main bhartiya jaali noton kii taskari karne waalon ko rajgaraane se kis had tak madad milti rahi iskaa andaja is baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki gyanendra ke shasankaal ke dauraan simra airport par pakadi gai jaali noton kii badi khep raturaat asli noton main tabdeel ho gai
 Obviously this would not have happened without the connivance of the government
 sawaal ye ki kya ab bhi nepal kaa purv rajkumaar bharat ke khilaaf is sajeesh main shariq he
 After fleeing Nepal, Paras has maintained its base in Singapore and countries such as Singapore and Thailand are also being used as transit routes in the game of smuggling fake currency into India

 ji haa, ek din plastic dharti ko nigal jayega
 Today, even though we are carrying out various campaigns to save the environment, until we stop using plastic, then forget that the earth will be able to breathe properly
 jaanate he plastic se hone vaale nuksaan:-1
 Polyethylene is the deadliest for Earth because its use is destroying the fertilizer potential of the land
 vahiin ise jalaane se nikalne vaala dhuaan ozon parat ko nuksaan pahunchaata he, jo global varmig kaa sabase bada kaaran he
 worldearthday2017: Earth is going to waste only because of us 2
 yaheen nahin plastic jab khilaunon kii shakl membecchon ke bich aata he to vah bacchon ke liye behad hanikaarak hota he
 3
 plastic bags bahut se jahrile chemicals se milakar banate hai
 Chemicals such as xylene, ethylene oxide and benzene are used to make it
 in chemicals se bahut si bimaariyaan or vibhinn prakaar ke disoders ho jate hai
 The new DGP of UP, i have been studying from IIT Roorkee, Sulkhan Singh, is a strict officer 4
 plastic ko puri tarah se nasht nahin kiya ja saktaa
 If you think that it can be destroyed by burning, then by burning plastic, a huge amount of chemical is produced

 The manner in which Prime Minister Narendra Modi took a sudden demonetisation decision on 8 November 2016, and the manner in which the phase of turmoil started in the country, the comovations are still going on
 janata qatari main hai apana hi paisa lene ke liye
 If someone is on strike, he is doing everything to justify the decision
 halaat- janata post netaa mast
 From banks to atms and atms to Parliament, the situation is the same everywhere
 vipaksh kaa aarope hai ki is dauraan lagbhag 84 logon kii maut ho gai hai
 The Prime Minister does not want to make a statement even while in Parliament, due to which the Winter Session so far is spending only and only the money earned by the sweat of the public in vain
 vipaksh puch rahaa hai - agar bainko main or ATM main paise hai to phir line itani lambii kaise dikh rahi he?darasal sarkaar ek tir se do nishane saadh rahi hai, pehla kaale dhan ko samaapt karnaa doosraa lage haath keshales iconmi ko badhaava dena
 Where the private companies were going to stay behind in cashless economy's dream, so started cashing dreams and made millions of customers in a single month
 50 dinon kii mohalat sawaalon ke ghere mempradhanmantri ne khud janata se 50 din kii mohalat maangi thi unhone vaada kiya he ki 50 din ke andar, janata ko nakadi kii pareshaani se nahin jujhna padegaa
 But if you look at the report card of a month, then this promise of the Prime Minister is now under question, because demonetisation is near to a month, but the problem is neither reduced nor seems to decrease
 arthshaastriyon kaa maananaa he ki noton kii kami purti main 8-10 maheene lag sakate hai
 The village country god Bharocessar said that the atms will be repaired as soon as possible, but even now atms are lying empty without notes in many places
 bainko ke sthiti yah hai ki jari kii gai limit me babajood bhi janata ko das yaa paanch paanch hajaar dekar chalata kar diya ja rahaa hai
 This situation is of the cities, what is happening in the village countryside, God is trusting all that
 daawa yah bhi kiya ja rahaa hai ki desh ke lagbhag 95 fisadi atm ko ab 500 va 2000 rupee ke naye note dene ke hisaab se sudhara ja chukaa he lekin line aaj bhi lagi hui hai, doodh dene vaali atm mashin ab bhi note nahin ugal rahi he
 Maybe our destiny of getting in line will fix us
 isse zyada pareshaani tab shuru hui jab lagbhag har duusare din nae-nae farmaan nikalne lage falswaroop janata main bhram kii sthiti paidaa ho gai
 The government says that more than 13 lakh crore rupees of old notes have been deposited with it

 So will the remaining amount come to the public in the next twenty-four days? a total of Rs 40,000 crore notes have been exchanged in banks and post offices
 Note-breaking broke the number of pieces of 2000 notes in many places at the places of terrorism, proved that there is a nexus between bank personnel and heirs of black money
 They have also been caught
 notebandi ne aatankwaad or naksalwad kii to lagbhag qamar hi tod di he, khaskar jis prakaar naksaliyon ne ek maheene main aatmasamarpan kiya he
 But the discovery of 2000 notes with terrorists also gives some ominous messages
 sabase mjedaar to rahaa logon kaa raaton-raat logon kaa karodpati ban janaa, desh ke kaijandhan khatonmen achaanak kisne kaha se karodon daal die
 1 of the undisclosed income so far in these accounts
 64 karod rupaya jamaa he
 In many parts of the country, it was also seen that millions of notes worth 500–1000 were either burnt or thrown in rivers, or these notes were deposited in temples
 sarkaar ne yah bhi daawa kiya hai ki aath november kii notebandi ke baad se ab tak iskar vibhaag ne lagbhag 2,000 karod rupee kaala dhan pakadaa he
 And has seized cash and jewelery worth Rs 130 crore

 ) Today, India face Pakistan in the World T20
 is match main afridi, yuvaraj, kohli, rohit, hafeez, ahamed shahzad par sabaki nigahen hai
 Apart from these, Mohammad Aamir, Shahid Afridi, Ashish Nehra and Ravichandran Ashwin all have great hopes in the bowling department
 is bich ham kuch aise khilaadiyon kii baat karne ja rahe hai jin par bahut zyada nigahen nahin hai, lekin ye is match main star ban sakate hai
 1
 dhawan kaa bat machaa saktaa he dhamalshikhar dhawan kii batting main ninratarata naa hone ke chalate is match main kam hi logon ne unase koi ummid laga rakhi he
 In such a situation, if Dhawan's bat shines then it will be difficult for Pakistan
 dhawan tabadatod batting kar akele dam par match ko palatney kaa dam rakhte hai
 If Dhawan does not get out in the initial over, then he will surely be in trouble for Pakistan
 2
 If left, Hardik Pandyatim is only Hardik Pandya in the lower order of India who has got equal batting
 hardik apni hard hiting ke liye jane jate hai
 Making runs at a strike rate of 150-200 is as easy as pinching them
 pakistan ne apni zyada taiyaari team india ke top order ke liye kar rakhi hogi
 In such a situation, if they play even 20-25 balls, then Team India can hang big total on the scoreboard
 iske alaava hardik jarurat ke vakt brakethru dilaane main bhi maahir hai
 Every Indian fan would definitely like to see their celebrations like Brett Lee in Eden
 3
 Sharjil's bat may shine Sharjeel Khan, who has played a tremendous game in PSL, may not be in good form but his ability to turn the match on his own cannot be questioned
 sharsil kai baar apni team ko dhuandhar shuruyaat dilaakar ye baat sabit kar chuke hai pichley kuch maichon main nahin chale sharsil agar eden par chal nikle to pakistan ke middle order par dabaav nishchit taur par kam ho jayega
 We all saw his bat performance during the 10-ball innings against Bangladesh
 4
 Wahab Riyaz may become a threat, everyone is talking about Mohammad Aamir in this high voltage competition, but there is very little discussion on Wahab Riaz
 wahaab riyaj acchhee pes ke saath short pich gendon kaa jabardast istemaal karne ke liye jane jate hai
 The best example of this was shown against Australia in the 2015 World Cup
 eden kii pich par pes bolers ko swaabhaavik madad milti he
 In such a situation, given the weaknesses of Indian batsmen on short pitch balls, Wahab can do 'shaheen' for Afridi
 5
 Omar Akmal's hard hitting may come in the bottom order to score fast or to give a fast start to the team by batting in the upper order, Omar Akmal is the master of both
 agar ye galat shot khelkar yaa phir jaldbaaji main ran out naa hon to ye kisi bhi bowling atake ke liye khatra ban sakate hai
 Akmal is known for hitting long sixes
 tii20 main ye aise ballebaaj hai jo apana din hone par kisi bhi halaat main fanse match ko apni taraf mode sakate hai
 Apart from these five, in this match, Pakistani wicketkeeper batsman Sarfraj Ahmed will also be watching
 asia cap tii20 main jab bharat-paak kii timen bhidi thim to dhoni ko apana idal maanane vaale sarfaraj ne hi paak kii taraf se morcha thama tha

 It is worth mentioning that Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has given an ultimatum to Tejashwi Yadav to prove himself clean after the CBI case was registered in corruption cases
 nitish ne saaf kar diya he ki ve sahyogi lalu yadav or unke bete tejasvi yadav se kya chaahate hai

 On 23 June, Shankaracharya Swami Swaroopanand Saraswati of dwarka-sharada Peeth gave a statement on Sai devotees of India as if the lightning dropped
 “yah kaha jaataa he ki sai baba hindu-muslim ekta kaa pratik he
 This would have happened when he was considered Hindus as well as Muslims
 lekin musalmaan to use maanate nahin hai, to ham hi kyon maane?”shankaracharya ke haridwar se ‘achaanak’ jari hue is bayaan ne desh main khalabali machaa di
 In Shirdi, Sai devotees lodged effigies of Shankaracharya in various places, registering a case of inciting religious sentiments against him
 yah pehali baar nahin tha jab shankaracharya kii kisi baat ne vivaad kaa rup liya ho
 During the Lok Sabha elections, he also raised a strong objection to the bjp's slogan "har-har Modi"
 iske baad bijepi ko safai pesh kerani padi thi or narendra modi ko apane samarthakon se is naare kaa istemaal nahin karne kii guhaar lagaani padi thi
 In a video released to news channels, the 90-year-old Shankaracharya said, "sai Baba's income from Shirdi is just a little less than Tirupati Balaji's income
 ” ve kis ore ishaara karnaa chaah rahe the, yah samajhnaa mushkil nahin he
 In spite of all the protests happening in the patriotism , Shankaracharya stood by his point
 yahi nahin, unhone aage bhi joda, “logon ko pataa nahin he ki jisaki ve puja kar rahe hai vah ganga ko nahin maanata tha, keval allaah ko maanata tha or maansaahaari tha
 In response, there was a fierce competition among Sai devotees to bathe the Sai idols in the Ganges
 or jaise yahi kaaphi na tha
 Union Water Resources Minister Uma Bharti also jumped into the controversy
 shankaracharya ke samarthan main naga sadhu bhi utar aae
 The heads of the Akharas of the Naga Sadhus called for the support of Shankaracharya's faith in the worship of Sai Baba and to enter the crusade to protect Sanatana Dharma
 akhaada pramukhon ne ugr naga saadhuon ko “dharm kii khoi hui kranti waapas laane” kaa daayitv saunpa he
 Shankaracharya believes that Sai Baba is not an incarnation of God
 isi dharna ko puure hindu jagat main failaane ke liye akhaada pramukhon ne naga saadhuon ko elahabaad or haridwar main deraa daalane ko kaha he
 Here they will unite and strategize how to break the perception of Sai Baba as God
 kumbh ke shahi snaan ko chhodkar naga sadhu aam taur par kahin najar nahin aate hai
 It is believed that during this time, he is engaged in penance
 lekin ab unhen apni tapasya chhodkar dharm kii raksha ke liye ‘yuddh’ main shaamil hone ko taiyaar rahane kaa aadesh mila he
 There are about two lakh Naga monks in the country
 ugr swabhaav ke maane jane vaale ye sadhu sadakon par utar aae to kanoon or vyavastha kii haalat gambhir ho sakati he
 Here, by making a statement in support of Sai, Uma Bharti entangled herself in all this controversy
 unhone haridwar main kaha, “sai baba ne kabhi nahin kaha ki main bhagwaan hum
 Even the devotees of Sai Baba never said that declare him an avatar
 kitne logon ne sai ke darbar par mattha teka he or unke sankat nivaaran hue hai
 His statement provoked Shankaracharya and his supporters
 shankaracharya ne palatwaar karte hue kaha ki ve ab tak maanate the ki uma bharti bhagwaan ram kii bhakt hai lekin asal main ve musalamaanon kii anugami hai or isiilie ve ayodhya main ram mandir kaa nirmaan nahin karvaa pain
 Swami Swaroopananda is considered a Congress saint
 ve bijepi, pradhanmantri narendra modi or ram mandir andolan ke mukhar aalochak rahe hai
 Many organizations have come out openly against Shankaracharya's statement
 aresas ne sai baba kii aalochana ko anaavashyak bataaya he
 RSS leader Indresh Kumar said, "saints and sadhus should not interfere in the faith of others regarding the deities
 ” akhaada parishad ke purv pradhan mahant gyaan das kehete hai, “yah koi mudda hi nahin
 Swaroopanand does not know what is causing unnecessary controversy
 ”talavaarein khinch chuki hai
 Neither Shankaracharya nor Sai devotees are in a mood to retreat
 naga saadhuon ko is ladaai main utaarne ke bare main agni akhaada ke sachiv govindanand brahmacharee kehete hai, “dharmik apaat sthiti paidaa ho gai he
 Naga sadhus will have to fulfill the responsibility assigned to them by Adi Shankara
 aadi shankaracharya ne aathvin shatabdi main naga saadhuon ko dharm ke sangrakshak kii diksha di thi
 We have asked them to congregate in Prayag and Haridwar
 ” niranjani akhaade ke sachiv acharya narendra giri kehete hai, “hamaare kuch sadasyon ne mandiron se sai baba kii pratimaa hataani shuru kar di he
 Sai devotees have insulted Shankaracharya
 shastr sajjit sadhu jald karrwai karenge
 "regardless of the solution to the dispute, but Sai, who is finding a place in every temple, is surely blessing his priests

 In the matter of booth management, BJP President Amit Shah is known for his innovative strategies
 yahi vajah he ki unhen aksar siyaasi vishleshanon main bijepi ke chanakya kii upama di jaati he
 Tomorrow, on February 15, when Shah will take out a bike rally in Jind, Haryana, people will see a new idea of his booth management being implemented
 shah kii bike relibjepi adhyaksh amit shah jind main guuruuvaar main bike raily karne ja rahe hai
 In this rally, all ministers of the Manohar Lal Khattar government and BJP mlas and mps will accompany them on the bike
 ise desh kii sabase badi bike raily kaha ja rahaa he
 Till now, rallies have been organized by uniting supporters through trains, trucks, buses, tractors and trains, but the rally on such a large number of bikes seems to be a new experiment in itself
 75 hajaar bike reliharyana main kareeb 15 hajaar poling booth hai
 Five bikes and ten persons have been called to the rally from every booth in the state
 is tarah se pradesh bhar se 75 hajaar biken or dedh lakh kaaryakarta sidhe-sidhe is raily main shaamil honge
 President of Mission-2019, BJP President Shah is inaugurating Mission-2019 through this bike rally
 shah helicopter se jind pahunchenge or uske baad helleypad se raily sthal tak unako bike par jane kaa plan he

 us voter list main shaamil sabhi voters ko booth tak le jane or party ke paksh main vot dalwane kaa kaam usee pramukh panna ke paas hota he
 In order to strengthen the One Booth Ten youthbjp at the grassroots level, Shah started the formation of the Lotus Club under the formula of 'one Booth Ten Youth' at each booth
 iske jariye mandal str tak kii booth cametiyon ko majboot karne par jor diya gaya tha
 This formula of BJP has been adopted by many other parties as well
 bijepi kaa tiffin planbijepi ne tiffin plan kaa idia sangh se liya he
 This plan was first tried by the party in Gujarat
 iske jariye party ne booth str par party ko majboot kiya
 Under this, the party leaders take a tiffin of food from their house to every booth and interact with the party workers there and have food with them
 bijepi ne ab desh bhar main party ke saansadon ko kaaryakartaaon kii naaraazgi ko dur karne ke liye tiffin meeting kaa idia diya he

 ’’ unhone kaha ‘‘rajya main sthirataa or vikaas ke liye hamane mukhyamantri pad bhaajapa ko diya
 And now it is up to him to consider the issue of power sharing based on 50-50 formula
 ’’yah puche jane par ki mukhyamantri shibu sorain kab istipha denge hemanth ne kaha ‘‘pehle bhaajapa ko mukhyamantri pad kaa apana ummidavaar chunane dijie or 50-50 fomule par rukh spasht karne dijie

 In particular, Kangaroo offie Nathan Lyon has trapped him in his net four times
 aalochak kah rahe hai ki rishabh mili maukon kaa phayda uthaane main naakaam sabit ho rahe hai
 He does not seem to be giving due respect to Test cricket and his wicket
 vaise yah baat rishabh ke abhi tak ke score se bhi sabit hoti dikh rahi he
 Pant has scored 25, 28, 36, 30 and 39 in five innings in Australia
 yah score bataata he ki pant ne har pari main wicket par jamane ke baad apana wicket ganvaaya
 And the manner in which the wicket was lost also questioned Pant's attitude
 nishchit hi, agar is yuva wicketiper ke apane score ko badi pariyon main tabdeel karnaa he, to unhen apane khel par kaaphi kam karnaa hoga
 And according to the need of the team, you will also have to learn to choose your stroke and control your mind
 baharhaal, wicket ke peeche bhi pant par ungliyaan uthi hai, lekin unhone pichhali sirijon ke mukaable apane pradarshan main sudhaar kiya he
 This is evident from his record, which he has made in just three Test matches
 balki kahen ki abhi bhi tisare test kii australia kii duusari pari kheli jaani he
 While Syed Kirmani took 6 Tests and Mahendra Singh Dhoni took five Tests to do the same feat before Pant
 bataa den ki rishabhpant ne jari siries main teesraa test puraa hone se pehle hi 18 kaich apni jholii main jamaa kar liye hai
 And he has become the first wicketkeeper in Indian Test history to do so
 vahiin, kirmani or dhanoni ne kramash: 6 or 5 test maichon main 17 kaich lapke the
 You can understand yourself that the last fourth Test match is yet to be played, so Pant will also be wicketkeeping in another innings at the MCG
 jaahir he aise main rishabh pant is record ke str ko or ooncha kar sakate hai
