 Rajdeep Sardesai asked Iltija that the Mufti and Abdullah family have been accused that it was because of them that Kashmir has happened
 is par iltijaa mufti ne kaha, 'ye galat he
 The people of Kashmir are viewed with a wrong eye
 aap kashmir ke yuvaaon ko kehete hai ki ve patharbaj hai
 He said that this is not right, we are also like you
 sabhi patharbaj nahin hai
 you think wrong
 'linching par koi nahin hiraasat?iltijaa mufti kii maa mahabuuba mufti ko hiraasat main rakhe jane ke sawaal par unhone kaha, 'iskaa kaaran bataaya gaya ki ehtiyaat ke taur par unhen hiraasat main liya gaya taaki sthiti kharaab nahin ho

 'hakeekat nahin dikhaa rahaa mediamufti ne kaha ki anuchhed 370 hataane ko lekar bolaa gaya ki yah kashmir ke hit main he or ab iske baad kashmir kaa vikaas hoga

 His life has been affected for two months

 hamaare jivan ke liye ganga kii safai se zyada mahatvapurn ganga kaa aviral bahaav he
 Without avidity, the cleanness of the Ganges is not possible
 is soch ke vipareet banaaye gayi baandh vikaas nahin vinaash lekar aaye hai khaskar bihar, jharkhand ke liye
 The Farakka Dam has accumulated so much silt in the Ganges flowing from Bihar, Jharkhand that the scope of flood, flood level and wastage graph has increased considerably
 centre sarkaar is samasya kii ore koi dhyaan nahin de rahi
 Now the time has come to talk openly on these issues, to resolve them
 bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar is mudde par khaase aakraamak najar aaye
 The Bihar government, conducting a seminar in Delhi on the problem of silt in the Ganges, requested experts to suggest solutions
 shuukravaar ko ye seminar khatm hoga
 Its recommendations will also be sent to the central government
 nitish kumaarane kaha ki ganga hamaare liye raajnneetik mudda nahin, ye sabakaa mudda he or rashtriya mudda he
 The ever-decreasing danger of the Ganges, water quality and aquatic animals is a matter of concern for all
 jaise jangal kii saghanta baagh se pataa chalati he vaise hi ganga kii swatchta dolphin se pataa chalati he
 In the Ganges, gharial (ganges dolphins) and the Hilsa fish that grows in fresh water are on the verge of danger
 aise main ganga kii nirmalata or aviralata ke daawey par mugdh hone vaali centre sarkaar ganga main dolphin kii ginati or dasha kaa adhyayan karaaen
 Criticizing the National Waterways Policy, Nitish said that the waterways policy is not suitable for the Ganga already facing the problem of silt
 farkka baandh samasya kaa ek hissaa he naaki vahi ekmaatr samasya
 Farakka dam has a drainage level of 27 cusecs while in Mokama is 34 cusecs
 aise main farkka baandh ke liye pani ko jamaa karnaa hi samasya kii jad he
 When water accumulates, the flow stops
 ret baaluu tal main baith jaati he
 Then water comes out of the dam door and sand remains
 ye kai sau kilometre tak ho rahaa he
 That is when the Ganges enters Bihar from Buxar, it covers the distance of 110 kilometers from Patna to Patna in four hours
 lekin bhagalpur se farkka tak kii 175 kilometre kii duuri tay karne main chaar din lag jate hai
 That is, the flow is almost stagnant
 tehri or farkka baandhon ke dizin main bheeshan khami he
 Bihar is suffering as a result of Farakka's flaws in 42 years
 jaldi hi tehri baandh kii khami kaa gambhir nateeja saamne aa jayega
 On the plan to carry freight and passenger ships in the Ganga, Kumar said that it is necessary to study it honestly before implementation
 kyonki jab ganga main paanch se das meter kii dreging yani khudaai kar naharnuma sanrachana banaai jaaegi to ret kahaan jaaegi
 What will happen to the sand that accumulates in the flood every year
 isse hone vaale nuksaan kaa bhi aankalan karnaa hoga
 Its impact on the environment and the water bodies of the Ganges will also have to be reviewed
 sirf andhadhundh yojanaayen banane se nahin hoga
 There is a great difference of nature between other rivers and the Ganges
 ise duusari nadiyon ke samaan naa bartaa jaay
 In the inaugural session of the seminar, Swami Avimukteshwaranand, the successor of Shankaracharya Swaroopananda Saraswati, said that the cleaning of the Ganga would be done not by flowing money but by flowing water
 janata kaa moulik adhikaar he ki gomukh se chalaa gangaajal sabko mili
 But due to dams, water is not available
 is gambhir samasya par kaashi main 24 se 26 aktubar tak ganga sansad hogi
 Before this, Ganga Jagran Yatra will be taken out in every district along the banks of Ganga
 sansad main samaaj, sarkaar or visheshgyon ke saath vichaar vimarsh kiya jayega
 Swamiji said that these dams like Bhakra and Farakka were called by Nehru the temple of modern India
 unheen pandit nehru ne bhakhda ko motaape kii beemaari bhi kaha tha
 Therefore, the Central Government should conduct a deep study on the damage caused by these dams, the silt, or the problem of silt in the Ganga Yamuna and find solutions accordingly
 swami avimukteshwaranand ne kaha kiganga to hamaare liye divine dharoharhai
 Even today it attracts the most people
 duniya main pehla number ganga kaa he
 But, instead of honoring him, we have made preparations to transport him
 ye durbhagyapurna he

 khabaron kii maane to vah apane kariyar kii shuruyaat main hi chote parde par aana munasib nahin samajhate or isliye unhone is ofer ko thukraa diya
 The comments khabaron ke anusaar big bos kaa yah sijan salmaan khan host nahin karenge, isliye channel ne ranvir singh se sampark kiya tha
 According to the channel, Ranveer is quite popular among the younger generation nowadays, as well as a jumpy funny actor who can attract viewers and prove beneficial to the show's TRP
 isliye channel ne ranvir kii taraf rukh karnaa behatar samajha, magar ranvir apane kariyar kii shuruyaat main tivi par aane se parhez kar rahe hai, lihaaza unhone manaa kar diya
 In the last season too, when the episodes of Bigg Boss were extended, Salman could not complete the show due to the dates given to his films and other works and Salman left the show in between
 us vakt bhi channel ne salmaan kii jagah ranvir ko sho main laane kii koshish kii thi, magar tab bhi ranvir nahin aae the or farha khan ke saath us sijan ko puraa kiya gaya tha
 According to reports, Salman Khan will not be hosting this season of Bigg Boss, so the channel contacted Ranveer Singh
 channel ke mutabik, ranvir aaj kal yuva peedi main khaase lokapriy hai, saath hi uchhalane-kudane vaale mazaahia abhinayta hai, jo darshakon ko aakarshith kar saktaa hai or sho kii tiarapy ke liye phydemand sabit ho saktaa he

 At that time, the channel also tried to bring Ranveer in the show instead of Salman, but even then Ranveer did not come and that season was completed with Farah Khan
 pichley sijan main bhi jab big bos ke episods badaye gaye the, tabhi salmaan apni filmon or dusre kaamon ko di gai tarikhon kii vajah se sho ko puraa nahin kar paae the or bich main hi salmaan sho ko chhodkar chale gaye the

 If the picture of politics in Delhi changed, now the color of politics has started changing

 Arvind Kejriwal, the future Chief Minister of Delhi, arrived in the morning to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi at his 7-RCR residence
 17 minute tak chali mulaakaat main kejariwal ne dilli ke liye purna rajya kaa darja maanga or unhen shapath grahan kaa nyotaa diya
 It is said that Modi did not respond to the issue of full statehood, but promised to cooperate fully for the development of Delhi
 dilli ke bhavi dipti siem manish sisodiya bhi kejariwal ke saath the
 Speaking to the media after the meeting, Manish said, 'we told the Prime Minister that there is an absolute majority government both at the Center and Delhi
 isliye yah sunaharaa mauka he jab dilli ko purna rajya kaa darja diya janaa chahie
 'manish told that the Prime Minister has assured to cooperate fully in the development of Delhi
 saath hi, kejariwal ke shapath grahan samaaroh main aane main bhi unhone asamarthta jataai
 Modi is scheduled to go to Baramati on February 14 as part of the pre-planned schedule
 14 farvari ko aitihaasik ramlila maidan main arvind kejariwal siem pad kii shapath lene vaale hai
 It is also interesting that the two leaders are strongly opposed to each other in politics, but on 10 February, as soon as the picture of politics in the capital changed, the Prime Minister himself invited Kejriwal to come to tea
 haalanki mulaakaat ke dauraan chaay kahin najar nahin ai
 Significantly, a year ago, Kejriwal had sought time to meet Modi, but then Modi did not give him time
 dilli main haalia chunaav prachaar ke dauraan modi ne kejariwal par tikhe prahaar kiye the
 In his rallies, he had advised them to go to the jungle to work with the Naxalites and indirectly called them 'unfortunate'
 mulakaaton kaa dauradilli main aam aadmi party ko janata ne prachand janadesh diya or us janadesh ko saakaar karne ke liye rajdhani kii raajnneeti ke nae nayak arvind kejariwal matganana ke agle hi din yani 11 farvari ko ection main aa gaye

 Land is already ready Kejriwal had already prepared the land to meet Modi
 unhone modi cabinet ke do mantriyon se mulaakaat kii he or dilli ke bhavishya ko lekar apana agenda saaf kar diya he
 Along with this, we have also gathered complete information from the Chief Secretary of Delhi on the projects going on here and the economic condition of Delhi
 venkaiya naidu ke saath apni mulaakaat main kejariwal ne dilli ke anadhikrut coloniyon par baat kii
 Venkaiah has also given him full confidence to help
 vahiin, grih mantri rajnath singh se bhi kejariwal ne apni choti baithak main dilli ko purna rajya kaa darja die jane kii maang rakh di he
 That is, Kejriwal has done his homework before meeting Modi
 unhone dilli ke halaat ke puri jaankaree ikattha kar lee he or do kendriya mantriyon se mulaakaat karke apni maange bhi rakh chuke hai
 In such a situation, when he will meet the Prime Minister of the country, then perhaps he will be able to present his words in a firm manner according to the situation in Delhi

 Actually, these children were studying in a building that was in a very shabby state and could fall anytime
 karaval nagar ke alok punj senior secondary skool ke bachche lagaataar dar ke saae main padhai kar rahe the
 In this case, the Delhi government will also have to submit a status report to the High Court in three weeks

 Children are taught from class 6 to 12 at Alok Punj School in Karaval Nagar
 1992 se chal rahe is skool main padhai ke liye bacchon ko dilli sarkaar 100 fisadi fund detii aa rahi he

 yahi nahin, film main jaiki shroff or sunil grover bhi ahm role main hai
 Salman Khan's 'bharat' is directed by Ali Abbas Zafar, and depicts the story of the country with the life of a man in India
 kya pradhanmantri narendra modi ne 72wein swatantraaa diwas par svachh bharat mishan kii kamyaabi kaa ullekh karte hue vishwa swasthya sanghathan (WHO) kaa galat hawala diya? laal kile kii pracheer se apane bhaashan main piem modi ne apni sarkaar kii yojanaon kii safal gaatha kaa bakhaan kiya
 While praising the Swachh Bharat Mission, Modi cited a WHO report that the lives of three lakh children could be saved so far because of this mission
 pradhanmantri ne apane aalochakon par prahaar karte hue kaha ki jab unhone yojana ko shuru kiya tha to unka makhul udaaya gaya tha lekin yojana bahut zyada safal sabit hui
 The India Today Fact Check team investigated the Prime Minister's claim about the success of the Swachh Bharat Scheme
 piem modi ne 2014 main apane pehle swatantraaa diwas bhaashan main yojana kaa elaan karte hue kaha tha ki bharat ko svachh banane kaa mishan unki sarkaar kii praathamikta hoga
 Then launched Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (SBA) or Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) from 2 October 2014
 ye bharat kaa ab tak kaa sabase bada swatchta abhiyaan tha jisase 30 lakh sarkari karmchaariyon, skool or college ke chaatro ko joda gaya
 It was launched in 4,041 cities, towns and connected rural areas in the country simultaneously
 svachh bharat mishan kaa lakshya 2 oktober 2019 yani mahatma gandhi kii 150veen jayanti tak desh ko puri tarah ‘khule main shouch’ se mukt karana tha
 For this, 9 crore toilets were to be built in the villages
 peyajal or swatchta mantralay ke aankadon ke mutabik ab tak 8 karod se adhik tallet banaae ja chuke hai
 The government claims that more than four lakh villages in 427 districts of 19 states and union territories have been liberated from the 'open defecation' trend
 in aankadon ke mutabik mishan sahi disha main raftaar ke saath chal rahaa he
 Referring to the success of the Swachh Bharat Mission, PM Modi said in his Independence Day speech on Wednesday, 'when i announced the Swachh Bharat Mission in 2014 from the ramparts of this Red Fort
 logon ne meraa makhul udaaya tha ki main kyon is par urja laga rahaa hum, jabaki sarkaar ke liye or bahut kuch karne ko he
 But the WHO report has recently come
 isamen kaha gaya he ki swatchta mishan kii vajah se bharat main teen lakh bacchon kii jaan ko bachaaya ja sakaa he
 Saving the lives of three lakh children is laudable humanitarian work
 ’india today fact check team ne WHO kii report ko khangala jiske aadhaar par piem modi ne teen lakh bacchon kii jaan bachaae jane kaa daawa kiya tha
 Earlier this year, the South East Asia Regional Office of the WHO praised the Swachh Bharat Mission
 is report main kaha gaya he, ‘WHO bharat kii surakshit swatchta sevaayen adhik se adhik logon tak pahunchane kii patibaddhta kii prashansa karata he, ye maanate hue ki oktober 2019 tak 100% lakshya hasil kar liya jayega, 2014 main shuru hue is mishan se atisar (dast) or protein urja kuposhan se hone vaali 300,000 mauton ko roka ja sakegaa
 This WHO report was related to the impact of Swachh Bharat Mission on rural India
 WHO ne report main kaha, ‘sarkaar kii khule main shouch kii pravriti ko khatm karne kii patibaddhta se atisar kii beemaari or protein urja kuposhan ke boj par vyapak asar padegaa jo ki mrityu dar ko ghataane se sambhav ho sakegaa
 'apparently, the WHO made this estimate based on the efforts being made under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan
 lekin piem modi ne swatantraaa diwas ke bhaashan main report kaa hawala dete hue kaha ki teen lakh jaanon ko ab tak bachaaya ja chukaa he
 An investigation by the India Today's Fact Check team revealed that the WHO report, which PM Modi cited in his Independence Day speech, praised the Swachh Bharat Mission but there was no talk of saving three lakh lives so far
 was
 iskaa sirf anumaan lagaaya gaya tha
 That is, PM Modi's claim of rescuing three lakh lives by quoting WHO report was not factually correct

 The move was taken by the Union Home Ministry after the TARS MLA disguised the facts related to foreign travel
 grih mantralay ke is aadesh main kaha gaya gaya he ki ramesh chennamaneni ne sahi jaankaree chhipaai or sarkaar ko gumraah kiya
 If they had informed about this, the competent authority in this ministry would not grant them citizenship
 mantralay kii ore se yah bhi kaha gaya he ki yadi vidhayak ke khilaaf karrwai nahin kii gai to yah paripati ban jaaegi or log gumraah kar naagarikta hasil kar sakate hai
 That is why it has been decided to abolish his citizenship
 vahiin chennamaneni ne kaha he ki vah hai court jaaenge
 Chennamaneni is an MLA from Vemulawada seat in Telangana
 grih mantralay ke aadesh main kaha gaya ki sakasham praadhikaar santusht he ki yah saarvajanik rup se thik nahin hoga ki chennamaneni bharat ke naagarik bane rahen or isliye faisla kiya gaya he ki unki naagarikta khatm kii jaati he

 salmaan khan kii 'sultan' relies hone ke baad se hi darshakon kii nazren aamir khan kii 'dangal' par bhi thim
 The reason was that 'dangal' is also based on wrestling and its story is also based on Haryana
 lekin 'sultan' kushti ke bahaane ek lav story thi, vahiin 'dangal' bahut saare tir ek saath chalaati he
 'dangal' is telling that the first message in the end is 'dangal' is to save daughters
 gita or babita phogot ke bare main jo bhi jaanate hai, unako yah jarur pataa hoga ki jis kshetra se wo aati hai, vahaan kanya bhrun hatya dar bahut zyada he or sex reshyo behad bigadaa hua he
 Even today, it is believed that the girls will go to their marriage
 
 
 mhare pe boj banengi
 But the wrestler, Mahavir Singh Phogat, who learned and gave examples like Geeta and Babita to the country
 
 
 us soch or bhaavon ko use aamir ne bahut khubsuurati se 'dangal' ke do minute ke trailor main dikhaa diya he
 Let me tell you how Geeta Phogat, who won the first gold medal in women's wrestling at the Commonwealth Games in 2010, is the story of 'geeta Phogat'
 padhein :'dangal' jis gita kii kahani he, wo pahalwani kii rani he
 
 
 It can be said that the sequel of 'sultan' was the story of a player regaining the spirit and spirit, which also had a romance
 apane pyaar ko paane kii chaah 'sultan' ko banaati he or phir use waapas paane ke liye vah waapas akhaade main utarataa he
 Also read: Salman is like Azam Khan
 
 
 film kaa ant hota haisalmaan khanyaani sultan kii beti ke boxing gloves pahane panch ke saath
 Now how a father prepares his daughter to win the medal for the country, in this way, it can be called the sequel of 'sultan'
 'dangal' ke trailor main aamir khan akhaade main najar aate hai, salmaan kii tarah gathile badan ke saath
 
 
 But it is known that this look will be seen in a few scenes
 'sultan' vaali jhalkavahin 'dangal' kii pehali jhalak main scooter, becoground main khub beats ke saath hariyaanvi lahaze kaa ekasaas dete bol or akhaade kii jhalak ise kaaphi had tak 'sultan' ke kareeb hi khadaa kar rahi he
 The set is also giving the feel of 'sultan' Haryana
 or aise hai alag
 
 
 In the area from which Mahavir Singh Phogat comes, the son is considered the lamp of the house
 chaar betiyon ke hone se vah niraash dikhte hai
 The 'sultan' was not as happy
 mahavir kii ichha he ki betaa ho jise vah desh ke liye taiyaar karen
 Later he prepares the daughter for his ambition
 phir pradesh nahin puure desh ko bataate hen ki chhoriyaan ghar kii laaj nahin, sar ooncha karne vaali bhi hoti hai
 Aamir has a touch like 'rang De Basanti' in Haryanvi, but his facial expressions are so amazing that the tone will not stop
 medalist ped par nahin ugte
 
 
 When you hear the word hard in the dialog, you will understand it very well
 vahiin agali line main aamir kaa sapana ko sapana bolnaa ummid jagaata he ki film main vah boli ke maamle main bhi niraash nahin karenge
 In such a 'sultan', the problem was with Salman's Haryanvi
 majaak karte hue to vah 'prem mod' main zyada rahete the
 He could not get hold of the bid
 damdaar dialog hai donon filmon kii janmamla khel kaa he to 'sultan' kii hi tarah 'dangal' main bhi dialogs par puraa dhyaan diya gaya he
 Champion in both films is the thing to prepare
 'dangal' ke kuch dialog yahaan dekhen :- medalist aise hi nahin banate, inhen bananaa padataa he pyaar se mehnat se, lagan se
 
 
 - No more wrestling will be a riot - Everything that diverts their attention from the wrestling, i will remove it - Always remember one thing, son, if you win j Silver, people will forget you
 jo gold jiti to misaal ban jaavagi
 Opening and earnings will be made in the record
 The first trailer of 'dangal' coming on December 23, it seems that both its opening and earnings will be tremendous
 'sultan' 6 july ko id par ai thi
 Salman is the star of this festival and this release date never disappointed him
 vaise hi aamir disambar main christmas ke star hai
 His upcoming film Lagtaar has been a superhit at the end of the year
 or phir blockbster aise hi nahin banatin, inhen bananaa padataa he pyaar se mehnat se, lagan se
 
 
 And Aamir is the 'mahaveer' of this fun

 chawla ne is ghatana ko sharmnaak qaraar dete hue kaha ki purv mukhyamantri prakaash singh badal se aisi aashaa nahin thi kyonki aisa lagata he ki sukhbir badal ne pita ko bataaye bina hi yah nirnay le kiya hoga

 Cricket is called a Gentleman's game, but many times it has happened when cricketers tarnish this image
 is baar australian salaami ballebaaj david warner ne apni harakat se cricket ko sharmasaar kiya he
 Warner is accused of being intoxicated and attacked England's all-rounder Joe Root
 warner in dinon apni ballebaaji ke liye nahin, balki kisi or hi vajah se surkhiyon main hai or ye vajah aisi he, jiske chalate warner hi nahin, balki puri cricket australia baikfoot par he
 The result of Warner's act is that he was sidelined in the Champions Trophy with New Zealand on Wednesday
 sharaab ke nashe dhut warner ne aadhi raat ek baar main naa sirf jo root ke saath buree tarah marpet balki unke saath gaali-galoch bhi kiya
 Warner first abused Joe Root and then went ahead and hit his chin with a strong punch
 darasal, ek baar main jane ke dauraan jo root ne apane sir par nakli bal or dadhi laga rakhi thi or root ko is haalat main dekh kar warner ko achaanak itnaa gussa aayaa ki unhone pehle to root kii dadhi noch lee or phir unke chehre par ghunsa jad diya
 Later players from both teams rescued Root from Warner's clutches
 bas, phir kya tha? raat ke andhere main hui is vaardaat ne cricket kii puri duniya main sansani failaa di
 The matter quickly reached the management of both teams and before dawn, Warner was pulled out of the Champions Trophy match with New Zealand on Wednesday and then handed a ticket to Australia for a comeback in a few hours
 ravivaar ko australia or england ke bich hue match main england ne australia ko 48 ranon se shikast di thi, lekin match main munh kii khaane ke badale warner apni khiz maidan ke baahar virdohi team ke khilaadiyon par nikaalenge, aisa kisi ne bhi nahin sochaa tha
 Warner has already been made Bad Boy This is not the first time when Warner is in the news for some wrong reason
 abhi haal hi main ipel ke dauraan australia ke do khel patrakaron ke khilaaf twitor par ashleel baaten likhane kii vajah se warner kii kaaphi kirakiri hui thi
 Delhi Daredevils vice-captain Warner could not do anything special with the bat here, but as soon as he got the chance, he broke the limits of decorum on social networking sites and gave people a chance to send a damn on him
 warner ke aalochak sharabkhori kii aadaton kii vajah se bhi unhen nishane par lete rahe hai
 Warner vowed not to come to India and drink alcohol in the wake of the Champions Trophy preparations before the IPL, but those who know Warner say that during the IPL, he not only drank heavily, but also had fun with him from Australia
 Three school friends also reached India
 vivaadon main ghir chuke australian cricketerwaise akele warner hi kyon, australia ke andrew symonds or shen worne jaise duusare khilaadi bhi pehle is tarah kii galat or ajeebogareeb vajahon se surkhiyon main rahe hai
 Cricket and drug cocktails have embarrassed cricket not once or twice, but more often
 phir chaahe baat 2009 ke tii-20 champions trophy ke dauraan symonds ke sharaab pine kii ho yaa phir nashe kii vajah se 2003 ke worldcup se shen worne ke baahar hone kii
 Symonds was sent back in the middle of the tournament because of an alcoholic uproar during the 2009 T20 World Cup
 lekin shaayad symonds kii iklauti galati kii sajaa nahin thi
 Potting said after this action, Symonds did too much this time
 matlab saaf he ki symonds pehle bhi apane team ke members ke saath hi bhid rahe the
 By the way, this was not Symonds 'first and last mistake, whether it was sledding or Symonds' infamy of confronting Bhajji (harbhajan Singh)
 vaise nashebaaji or hangaame kii baat chale or australian spinner shen worne kaa zikr naa ho ye mumkin hi nahin he
 While Warne was expelled from the team for drug use in 2003, Warne was once caught drinking beer on the field
 nashe main duubate-duubate bache the flintoff2009 tii-20 world cap ke dauraan england ke tej gendbaaj or us daur ke up captain andrew flintoff ne to nashe main kuch aisa kar diya tha jisase har koi sakate main aa gaya tha
 When the England team went to play the World T20 tournament in the West Indies in 2009, Flintoff was drowned while having fun riding in a boat so immersed in alcohol
 bataate hai ki us raat flintoff ne 4 ghante se bhi zyada vakt tak lagaataar sharaab pi thi
 Indian cricketers have also created a furore and the infamy of violence and violence is not limited to foreign cricketers, but Indian cricketers have also been accused in this way
 2010 main tii-20 worldcup ke dauraan west indies main team india ke chah khilaadiyon or indian phens ke bich ek baar main party ke dauraan jhadap ho gai thi
 Because here the team came to have fun after the defeat in the match
 tii-20 world cap ke semifinal main munh kii khaane ke baad team india ke kai khilaadi apane mulk se hajaaron mile dur ek nite club main apana gam bhulane ke liye pahunche the
 Incidentally, during this time there was also a gathering of Hindustani cricket fans from all over the world
 lekin isse pehle ki hindustani khilaadi abhi haar ke sadame se ubar pate ki yahaan ek or sadma unka intjaar kar rahaa tha
 In this pub named Tequila Jose, the likes of Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina, Rohit Sharma, Zaheer Khan and Ashish Nehra had stepped in as soon as the fans started hooting these cricketers by calling them loosers-loosers
 team india ke in khilaadiyon ke liye ye baat bardaasht ke baahar hone lagi or tab achaanak team ke donon tej gendbaaj jahir khan or ashish nehra aape se baahar ho gaye or tanakshi karne vaale logon kii taraf bade
 Fans were also in large numbers, so a push-up started on both sides
 dekhte hi dekhte halaat bad se badtar hote gaye or bich-bachaav ke liye team india ke ranvir yuvaraj singh ko bich main aana padaa
 After the swamp of the people, this matter became quiet, but this jumble of fans in the pub with the players became a big news
 ye or baat he ki pub ke maalikon se lekar khud cricketer tak ne tab marpet kii in khabaron se inkaar kiya tha
 Pakistan players are also no more, with Paki Pakistan cricketers and controversies, Choli Daman has been supported
 2007 main dakshin africa main shoeb akhtar ne apane saathi mohammad asif kii net practice ke dauraan balle se dhunaai kii thi
 Before this, Miandad had already made headlines due to wrong reasons
 2007 main pakistan kii team dakshin africa ke daure par thi
 Suddenly during the net practice, something like this happened between Shoaib and the other fast bowler Mohammad Asif, which shocked Pakistan cricket fans as well as the entire cricket world
 pehle to kisi baat par donon ke bich kahasuni hui or agle hi pal shoeb akhtar ne gaaliyaan dete hue asif par hamalaa kar diya
 He hit the bat with full force on Asif's thigh, but luckily Asif did not get hurt much
 is vaardaat kaa asar ye hua ki pakistani cricket board ne shoeb ko fouran ghar kaa rasta dikhaa diya
 But this was not the first time the two were in the news for the wrong reasons
 isse mahaj ek saal pehle yani 2006 main donon ko bharat main ho rahi champions trophy ke dauraan nashili dawaaon ke istemaal kii vajah se team se nikaal baahar kiya gaya tha
 This time Shoaib was banned for two years while Asif was 12 months old
 cricket ke vivaadon kaa kissa javed miyandad kii harakat kaa zikr kiye bina adhuraa sa hi lagata he
 Famous Pakistani batsman Javed Miandad was seen by the world leaping to the crease in a strange way when he was fed up with repeated appeals from Indian wicketkeeper Kiran More
 1992 main jab pakistan or hindustan ke bich worldcup kaa muqabla chal rahaa tha, more wicket ke peeche lagaataar apil kar rahe the
 And Miandad found it so bad that he started frog jumping at the crease, mimicking Morey
 apane netaaon ke swaagat ke liye bijepi kaaryakarta itane utsuk hue ki airport kii suraksha ko taak par rakhkar ranve tak ja pahunche
 The incident is from the airport where three ministers in the Modi cabinet returned to Patna on Friday after taking oath
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki kendriya mantrimandal main shaamil hone ke baad shuukravaar ko pehali baar patna pahunche bijepi saansad rajeev pratap rudi, giriraaj singh or ramkripal yadav ke swaagat ke liye hajaaron kii sankhya main bijepi kaaryakarta patna airport pahunche the
 But as soon as the ministers arrived, the BJP workers broke the security of the airport
 mantriyon ke swaagat main maujuud bheed is kadar bekaabu ho gai ki wo suraksha ghere ko laanghte hue ranve ke kareeb ja pahunche
 Actually, BJP workers were allowed to go to the state hangar inside the airport to welcome the ministers
 aamtaur par yahaan chote aircraft ko park kiya jaataa he
 But the crowd became uncontrollable as soon as the ministers' ship landed
 surakshakarmiyon ne turant sthiti ko sanbhaalane kii koshish kii
 Seeing the seriousness of the matter, the BJP ministers themselves took the front and instead of walking on foot, reached the crowd
 mantriyon ne jaise taise bheed ko samajhakar sthiti ko sambhala
 After this act of BJP workers, a big question has arisen on the safety of Patna Airport
 ye sawaal uthne lage hai ki eport par itani bheed hone ke baavjood suraksha ke pukhta intjaam kyon nahin kiye gaye

 ) The most magnificent temple of Hindus in the world, Tirupati in Andhra Pradesh, has more than 9,000 kg of gold
 yah jaankaree adhikariyon ne di
 Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam (TTD), the manager of the Sri Venkateswara Temple, has 7,235 kg of gold with various nationalized banks under various deposit schemes

 According to sources, the board is studying various deposit schemes of gold and will deposit the higher returns
 titidi ke khajaane main baaki 553 kilo sone main shraddhaluon ke chadhaave ke chote-chote aabhushan shaamil hai
 The TTD often refrains from giving details of the gold deposits, but after the seizure of 1,381 kg of gold by election officials in Tamil Nadu last month, the institution presented details about the gold
 sona tamilnadu ke tiruvallur jile main 17 april ko us samay jabt kiya gaya jab ise pienbi kii chennai shakha se tirupati sthit titidi ke khajaane main le jaaya ja rahaa tha
 TTD initially denied that the seized gold was his, and said that he did not even know that the temple gold was coming back
 lekin vivaad badhane par apane rukh kaa bachaav karte he ki sona jab tak titidi ke khajaane main nahin pahunch jaataa tab tak vah uskaa sona nahin he
 Two days after PNB handed over the papers to the Income Tax Department, the gold reached the TTD treasury
 bank ne sona tirupati mandir kaa hone or use mandir bheje jane sambandhi kagajaat iskar vibhaag ko diya tha
 TTD executive officer Anil Kumar Sighal came in with full details as Chief Secretary L

 a meeting was called in the temple to see how the idol departed with respect

 Before the Union Budget, Chief Economic Advisor Krishnamurthy Subrahmanyan's Economic Survey 2018-19 added a whole chapter of behaviorist economics, outlining four key strategies for implementing public policies: Free environment: Individuals / Firms have to Leaving the road free; Light push: push people out to move towards the preferred goal Ana; Incentives: use of positive and negative measures for behavior change; And dictate: pressurizing new orders to achieve specific results
 sarkari arthshaastri bhale halke dhakke vaale nazariye kii himaayat karen, lekin narendra modi to bataur pradhanmantri apane duusare kaarykaal main lakshya hasil karne ke liye badlaav ke chaaron tareekon kaa istemaal kar rahe hai
 First of all, he followed the 'dictate'
 unhone bajet 2019 ke jariye apane iraade kaa khulaasa kiya, or apni chir-parichit style main unhone bada, vaaki bahut bada khwab dekha he
 He asked Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman to show in the budget how his government would work to double the size of the Indian economy, ie the current 26
 1 kharab dollar kii arthvyavastha ko 2024-25 tak $50 kharab dollar tak pahunchaana
 To understand how huge this goal is, consider these facts: When Modi became Prime Minister in 2014, the size of the economy is 18
 5 kharab dollar kaa tha
 At the end of his five-year term in 2019, the economy grew at an average rate of 8 percent annually to 26
 7 kharab dollar tak pahunchi
 To reach $ 50 trillion by 2024, the economy needs to maintain that growth rate
 modi ne kaha, ''pehle bharat chal rahaa tha, lekin ab new india daudega
 "if the economy reaches $ 50 trillion by 2024, and maintains the same pace of growth by 2030, the Indian economy will grow from the current sixth position in the world to the third position in terms of size
 is tarah america or china ke baad bharat teesri sabase badi arthvyavastha ban jayega
 a day after the budget, in Varanasi, Modi told the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) workers the complex principles of the economy with easy words and idioms as to why they are pursuing such a huge goal
 unhone kaha, ''kek kaa aakaar myne rakhata he
 The larger the cake, the larger the pieces people get
 hamane paanch varshon main bharat ko 50 kharab dollar vaali arthvyavastha banane kaa lakshya rakhaa he
 The larger the size of the economy, the more prosperity will come in the country
 '' uske baad pradhanmantri ne kaha ki ab focus desh main prati vyakti aay ko duguni (philhal 10,534 rupye prati maah) karne par hoga, kyonki, jaisaa unhone kaha, ''jab prati vyakti aay badhati he, to kray shakti main bhi usee kram main badhotaree hoti he,
 This increases demand
 maang main is vruddhi ko puraa karne ke liye, utpaadakta badhati he
 This leads to expansion of production and service sector
 ye sab milakar rojgaar ke nae avasar paidaa karte hai
 An increase in per capita income also increases savings, which can be invested
 ''bajet 2019 main, modi ne 50 kharab dollar ke lakshya hasil karne kii raah par badaae ke liye teen mukhya masalon par daanv lagaaya: bade paimaane par buniyadi dhaancha vikaas, karj kii aasaan uplabdhta or krishi main bade dhanchaagat badlaav
 At the top of this list, it is a matter of spending 100 lakh crore rupees in the next five years on the construction of infrastructure across the country
 iskaa matlab hoga ki maujuuda 7 lakh karod rupye salanaa ke bajaae 20 lakh karod rupye salanaa kharch
 This includes the rapid construction of national highways as well as the third phase of the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana
 25 lakh kilometre gramin sadakon ko apgrade karne ke liye 80,000 karod rupye kaa aavanton bhi shaamil he
 1 by 2022 under Pradhan Mantri Awas yojana-gramin
 95 karod ghar banane kaa bhi vaada kiya gaya
 9 since 2014 under Swachh Bharat Mission
 7 karod se adhik shauchalayon kaa nirmaan hua he or iske tahat 98
 2% of the houses have been covered by 2018-19
 modi ne in gharon main pipeline se pani pradaan karne ke liye har ghar jal yojana shuru kii he
 The second focus is to repair the financial system and clear the way for investment
 bajet main bainkon ke punarpunjikaran ke liye 70,000 karod rupye or tabah gaiyr-banking vittiya companiyon (enbiensi) ke liye 1 lakh karod rupye ke punaruddhar package kaa praavdhaan he
 The third important sector for the economy was to accelerate agricultural irrigation projects and boost agricultural exports, as well as provide income support of Rs 70,000 crore to the distressed farmers
 matsay or samudri utpaadon ke liye neeli kranti kii bhi neenv rakhi gai
 In addition to his $ 50 trillion dream, Modi has also implemented three other modes of behavior change, free of charge, encouragement and light-heartedness as described in the Economic Survey to achieve this goal
 sitaraman ke bajet bhaashan se sanket milte hai ki vimaanan, rajmarg, railway, bandargah or beemaa jaise pramukh kshetron main, sarkaar unmukt maahaul kii niti ko apanaakar videshi or gharelu khiladinnon ke liye nivesh or niyantran sambandhi baadhaon ko uttarottar kam karne ke drushtikon ke saath chalegi
 Showcasing incentives, the Prime Minister chose future industries and advanced technology sectors such as solar photovoltaic sales, lithium storage batteries, computer servers and semiconductor fabrication, and is trying to attract large manufacturing units in these areas through tax incentives 
 iskaa uddeshy un videshi companiyon ko bharat main apana kaarobaar sthapit karne ke liye aakarshith karnaa he jo america or china ke bich chal rahe vyapaarik tanaav ke falswaroop china se apana aadhaar or nivesh hataanaa chaahati hai
 The budget has given a light push to consumers and the auto industry to move towards green India and help reduce the country's oil exports by increasing the use of electric vehicles
 iske liye sarkaar ne electric vaahanon (ivies) par maal or seva kar kii dar ko 12 pratishat se ghataakar 5 pratishat karne kii patibaddhta jataai
 To make evs even more affordable, the government said that 2 on loan to buy such vehicles

 An additional income tax benefit of Rs
 in kshetron main baari nivesh kii peshkash ke baavjood, sitaraman ko bharosa he ki sarkaar rajkoshiya ghate ko kaabo main rakhane main safal rahegi
 As expected, the opposition parties termed the Prime Minister's promises on the budget as meaningless

W
 chidambaram ne kaha, ''lagata he, modi bade sudhaaron kaa jokhim uthaane ko taiyaar nahin hai
 On such criticisms, the BJP leader, former Finance Minister Arun Jaitley wrote in a blog that the Modi government believes in 'fiscal balance', in 'fiscal audacity'
 ek bade sarkari adhikari ne kaha, ''arthvyavastha ko disha dene ke liye usamen sthir sudhaar kii jarurat he na ki khalal daalane vaale kadamon kii
 Will make whatever changes are necessary, but cannot go beyond the mandate of the voter
 ''modi ne aalochakon ko ''peshewar nirashaavadi'' bataaya
 But many economists welcomed Modi's promise of a $ 50 trillion economy, but raised doubts about achieving this goal
 isaki vajahen hai
 The Indian economy is sluggish and the GDP growth rate is 6
 8 pratishat he, jo paanch saal main sabase neeche he
 But with overall global growth slowing, India managed to retain the title of being the fastest growing economy
 modi ke pad sanbhaalane ke baad se ausat vrudghi dar lagbhag 7
 3 percent, but this figure was also questioned by his former Chief Economic Advisor Arvind Subrahmanyam
 duusari vajahen bhi hai jo modi kii mahatvakankshi yojanaon main bharosa behaal nahin hone de rahi hai
 Private investment and exports have also fallen drastically in the last few years
 vikaas ke do aise pramukh kshetra hai jinhen aarthik surveykshan ne tej jidipi vrudghi or arthvyavastha ko 50 kharab dollar ke mahatvakankshi str tak pahunchane ke liye aavashyak mana he
 Experts say that bringing the economy to $ 50 trillion by 2024-25 will depend on many factors, including the real growth rate, inflation and currency exchange rate

 (see the accompanying story on the opinion of economists on the question of development
 )haalanki, vitt sachiv subhash chandra garg kaa maananaa he ki sarkaar lakshya samay se hasil karne ke raste par he
 He points to some things in the budget, "there is a lot about policy reforms in the budget
" nijee kshetra se nivesh praapt karnaa, vibhinn kshetron main pipipi, bade paimaane par mudrikaran kaarykram, ye sab sahaayak honge
 Though Modi has followed a phased economic policy so far, he will need to push for stringent reforms if he is to meet his stipulated target within the time limit
 khaskar infrastracchar sector main, jisase unhen arthvyavastha main joardaar badhat dilaane kii aas he
 For example, India now has the third largest domestic aviation market in the world
 is kshetra ko vastav main ek bada vaishvik hub bananaa he to iske liye badlaavkaari upayon kii jarurat he
 India has an open-sky policy that allows 100 percent foreign direct investment (FDI) in Indian airlines, but the ownership share can only be up to 49 percent
 isamen 5,000 kilometre ke daayre main aane vaale deshon ke niveshkon par bhi pratibandh he, jiske kaaran sudur purv or khadi deshon ke vyavsaayee nivesh nahin kar sakate
 This has been done to protect a handful of Indian airline companies, including the failed government carrier Air India
 isane gharelu or videshi donon tarah ke vistaar main adchane paidaa kii hai
 Qatar Airways flies to more than 160 destinations, while Air India only 40

 saath hi bhavishya kii chintaa bhi unhen hameshaa lagi rahati he
 Here are some convenient portfolios for such people
 inhen ham choti bachat yojana kah sakate hai
 Just think here, if you are in mid-age, you can take a loan, but if you are after sixty, then you will not get a loan from anywhere
 isliye jo kuch bhi nivesh karen use is hisaab se karen ki ritairement ke baad aapke paas baaki kii jindagi ke liye jamaa puunji ho

 pipief (PPF) ek jariyapeepief main paisa jamaa karnaa shuruuaati niveshak ke liye acha he jahaan vah kuch paisa apane bhavishya ke liye jamaa kar paata he
 It is a different matter that the rate of interest received from time to time has decreased
 philhal PPF par 8
 Interest is being given at the rate of 1 percent
 PPF main ek saal main keval 1
 Up to 5 lakhs of money can be invested
 lekin dhyaan dene vaali baat yah he ki jab aap PPF main paise jamaa karen to shuruaati maheenon main hi karen
 The financial year runs from April 01 to March 31
 isamen byaaj saal main ek baar miltaa he jabaki isaki calculation masik balance par hoti he
 That is, interest is accrued on the balance of the 5th of every month
 darasal is shrenee ke log tex se bachane ke liye janvari-farvari-march main jaakar PPF main paisa jamaa karte hai jabaki us par utana byaaj nahin mil paata jitna agar ise saal ke shuruuaati maheene yani april-may-june main jamaa karke paaya ja saktaa he
 In this, after 15 years PPF gets the money on completion of its term
 haalanki sharton ke saath kuch paisa nikaal sakate hai
 If you want after 15 years, invest this money in a particular place (fix deposit) or elsewhere
 ritairement tak aapke paas thik sa amount jamaa ho jaataa he
 As long as you are able to deposit money in this kind of investment, then you also get interest
 matlab jivan main durghatana ke samay aapke parivaar ke liye sivaay us jamaapunji ke kuch atirik nahin rah paata he
 Therefore, life insurance (life insurance) must also be there
 ipief epfipiepa par philhal 8
 You get interest from 75%
 nijee kshetra main kaam karne vaale karmchaaree kii company is acount ko kholti he
 Employee and company have equal stake in it
 philhal yah vetan kaa 12 fisadi hota he
 Actually EPF is your provident fund while EPS (employees Pension Scheme) is your pension
 selary kaa 12 fisadi EPF main jaataa he
 8 of the company's contribution
 33 fisadi (yaa 1250 rupaye main se jo adhik ho) EPS main jabaki baaki EPF main chalaa jaataa he
 EPS means that you do not get any interest on the amount deposited for pension
 jabaki provident fund vaale hisse par har saal byaaj judata jaataa he
 When you withdraw PF, you get both EPF and EPS amount
 life insurance-kuch log LIC yaa anya insurance company main apana paisa nivesh karte hai
 It involves risk
 haalanki ausatan ek insurance jivan bhar chalane main ghate kaa sauda lagata he kyonki isamen kuch jamaa puunji kaa 4-6 fisadi tak hi ritern miltaa he
 But due to the risk of life involved, the benefit of getting premature attracts people to take it
 choti aamadani ke logon ke liye yah ek acha vikalp hota he, jahaan unhen ummid hoti he ki jab tak jinda hai tab tak kuch to jamaa kar hi lenge jabaki jokhim ke vakt parivaar ko kuch jamaapunji hasil ho jaae
 While buying a life insurance policy, it seems that some of our investment is accumulating good money, whereas it is not
 is ritern main mudrasphiti yani mahangaai shaamil nahin hoti he
 Let us tell you by an example
 2005-06 main jahaan mahangaai dar 8
 85, while the insurance companies did not give the same amount of inflation during this period
 is tarah dekhen to yah bhi nivesh kaa koi behatar tarika nahin he
 It would be good that the amount you have fixed for the investment is engaged in different types of investment
 medical insurance-abhi bhi bharat main medical insurance us tarah popular nahin ho pai he jaisi isaki ummid thi
 Whereas if it is seen as an investment then it is a good investment
 ise kuch is tarah se samajhen
 a working person whose income is around the tax net
 agar jivan main sabakuch thik chal rahaa ho to thik he
 If a disease also happens to him or a member of his household, then the entire salary goes out in that and sometimes this expense also goes out of its capacity
 aise main yaad aata he ki medical insurance to le hi lenaa chahie tha
 At first it seems that we are healthy, after all what is the penalty (premium) is paying
 par iskaa sahi andaja tabhi pataa chal paata he jab aap yaa ghar ke anya sadsy biimaar hote hai or apni jeb se kharch hone ke bajaay kisi duusare (insurance company) kii jeb se paise jate hon
 Even those working in the private sector may be running a corporate insurance plan, but the benefits of insurance also become zero as soon as they go to work
 isliye chota hi sahi, ek flotor plan (parivaar ke liye medical insurance) to rakh hi lenaa chahie
 Renting a house - Every person needs a house for shelter
 yah jivan kii moolbhoot jaruraton main shaamil he
 But buying a house and renting it for the purpose of earning money is not a profitable deal
 darasal ek samay baad ghar kii keemat samay ke anusaar nahin badhati he
 It is considered old
 jise arthshaastra kii bhashaa main ghisaawat (dapriciation) kaha jaataa he
 Multiply it this way
 mana ek ghar bees saal pehle kuch lakhon main kharida ho or aaj kaa rate pataa kar len
 At the same time, this money would have been invested in different types of investment, some would have got less and some would have been getting higher returns
 nivesh visheshgy ghar ko investment naa maanakar libilities maanate hai
 Just think here, if you are in mid-age, you can take a loan, but if you are after sixty, then you will not get a loan from anywhere
 isliye jo kuch bhi nivesh karen use is hisaab se karen ki ritairement ke baad aapke paas baaki kii jindagi ke liye jamaa puunji ho
 Apart from this, after the age of retirement, the body becomes weak and is not able to work hard, which ends up being a means of earning
 or to or sharir bimariyon kaa ghar bhi banane lagata he jisase kharche kam hone ke bajaay badhate chale jate hai
 So, keep these things in mind and start small and save for the happiness of life after retirement

 The talks between Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and the newly elected President of the US Donald Trump are in the news
 is khabar se hairaani bhi ho rahi he kyonki chunaav prachaar ke liye dauraan trump ne pakistan ko sabase khatarnaak desh qaraar diya tha
 It has been claimed by the Government of Pakistan that Trump has praised Pakistan and the people there
 yahi nahin trump ne pakistan daure kaa navaj kaa nyotaa bhi kabool kar liya he
 Actually, Sharif called Trump and congratulated him on being elected president
 is dauraan donon netaaon ke bich tamaam masalon par baat hui
 However, the Government of Pakistan has issued a statement prominently highlighting the parts of the dialogue with Trump that make the image of Pakistan and the people there not only in the neighboring countries but also on the surface of the world
 trump kii team ne bhi saaf kiya he ki is baatcheet ke bare main pakistan sarkaar kii ore se jo kuch kaha ja rahaa he, vah paryaapt nahin he
 Trump has said many things about Pakistan, the people there and PM Nawaz Sharif
 inamen se 5 badi baton kaa matlab kya he, aaie jaanate hai
 
 
 1
 navaj shandaar vyakti hai, wo bahut acha kaam kar rahe hai
 For the Nawaz Sharif, such praise of the Pakistani Prime Minister on behalf of the future President of the world's most powerful country is like Sanjeevani
 is bayaan se lagata he ki trump kii najar main navaj sharif kii image pakistani janata kii najar main apane piem kii image kii tulana main acchhee he
 Because in recent times, all allegations of corruption including the Panama paper leak have been leveled against PM Sharif
 navaj sharif par apane parivaar ke naam desh hi nahin, balki videshon main akut dhandaulat jamaa karne ke bhi aarope lage hai
 Due to these allegations, his popularity has declined in Nawaz's country itself
 2
 Pakistan is a fantastic country and its people are very intelligent
 trump kii ore se pakistan or vahaan kii janata kii tarif kiya janaa nav-nirvaachit america raashtrapati ke rukh main bada badlaav he
 Earlier not only in election campaign, Trump has been condemning Pakistan for years
 saal 2012 main trump ne apane twitor acount ke jariye pakistan ko bhala-bura kaha tha
 During the presidential campaign, Trump had described Pakistan as a dangerous country
 trump ne musalamaanon kii america main entry par bain lagane ke vaade ke saath hi kuch mulkon ko aatank kaa garh qaraar diya tha
 Pakistan was also named in this list
 3
 America is ready to play whatever role Pakistan wants to resolve unresolved issues
 trump ke is bayaan kaa mul taur par ishaara kashmir masale par he
 This issue has been the root of a long feud between Pakistan and India
 trump se pehle bhi america ke jo raashtrapati hue unhone kashmir masale ko lekar madhyasthata karne se saaf inkaar kar diya
 America has always said that Kashmir is an issue between the two countries and both the countries can work together to solve this issue
 baavjood iske pakistan is masale kaa antarrashtriyakaran karne par tula hua he
 4
 mujhe navaj sharif kabhi bhi phone kar sakate hai, 20 janvari se pehle bhi
 The US and Pakistan have been each other's long-time allies, but the relationship between the two countries has soured in recent years on the issue of harboring terrorists
 america main 9 / 11 hamale ke mastermind alqaida pramukh osama bin laden ko jab america sena ne pakistan main ghuskar maaraa tha, us vakt donon deshon ke rishton main kaaphi kadavaahat aa gai thi
 At this time, the atmosphere is hot on the border of Pakistan and India
 donon padosi mulkon ke rishte din-ba-din tanaavpurn hote ja rahe hai
 In such a situation, Pakistan may need America at any time so that it can mediate to normalize the relationship with India
 5
 It would be an honor for me to visit Pakistan
 trump agar pakistan kaa daura karte hai to yah uske liye phydemand hoga
 a large part of the aid given to the US goes to Pakistan
 saal 2017 main pakistan ko america kii taraf se aarthik or suraksha sahaayta ke naam par kareeb ek arab dollar kii madad milane kaa anumaan he
 It is also worth noting that during the election campaign, Trump had even said that Pakistan is not a friend of America
 america ne pakistan ko arabon-kharbon dollar die lekin badale main use mila kya? bharat ne haal ke dinon main pakistan ko kootneeti ke morche par maat dete hue use padosi mulkon ke bich bhi alag-thalag karne main kamyaabi hasil kii he
 In such a situation, Pakistan is trying to show to the world that America is with it
