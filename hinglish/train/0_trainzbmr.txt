 The main reason for this is to impose Hindi
 'vaayaku ne kaha ki unke is bayaan kii vajah se log aalochana karenge or un par gussa karenge lekin yahi sach he
 Due to the use of Hindi, the level of debate in the House is continuously falling

 Vaiko, MDMK Chief: What literature is there in Hindi? It has no roots & Sanskrit is a dead language
 Shouting in Hindi nobody could understand even after using headphones(in Parliament)
 The standard of debates has deteriorated, the main reason for this is imposition of Hindi

 sweden main kooday kii killat ho gai he or is scandinavian desh ko apane behtareen ricikaling sanyantron ko chalaane ke liye duusare deshon se kooda aayaat karnaa pad rahaa he
 Sweden is one of the first countries to impose heavy taxes on fossil fuels in 1991, producing almost half of the electricity it needs
 sweden kaa ricikaling system itnaa sakasham he ki pichley varsh vahaan ke gharon se utpann hone vaale kachare ke ek fisadi se bhi kam hisse ko jameen main dabaane kii jarurat padi
 According to Anna Karin Gripwell, director of the Swedish Waste Management Recycling Association, her organization has inspired people over the years to never throw things out that can be recycled or reused
 sweden ke log prakruti ke taur-tareekon main rahanaa or paryaavaran se jude muddon par kya karnaa chahie ise lekar khaase jaagruk hai
 Sweden has implemented a National Recycling Policy so that private companies can also take on the task of importing and burning more of the garbage
 isse praapt urja neshnal heating network main chali jaati he or iskaa istemaal atyadhik thand ke samay gharon ko garm rakhane ke liye kiya jaataa he
 "this is the main reason that we have this district network so that we can use the heat generated by the recycling plant," the Independent quoted Gripwell
 europe ke dakshini hisse main log hamaari tarah is prakaar kooday se paidaa kii gai garmi kaa istemaal nahin karte
 They only use the chimney
 ham jeevashm eendhan ke vikalp ke rup main kooday kaa istemaal kar rahe hai
 Gripwell termed UK imports of litter from other countries a temporary condition
 gripvel ne kaha, 'european union ke deshon main kooday ko jameen main dabaanaa pratibandhit he, isliye jurmaana bharne kii bajaay wo ise hamen bhej dete hai
 They should build their recycling plants so that they can reduce their garbage there because we are working hard to do so
 ummid he ki har kooda kam hoga or jis kode ko jameen main dabaane kii nasht karne kii jarurat ho to use apane hi desh main kiya janaa chahie
 But to use recycling to generate heat, a large heating or cooling system will be required and it will take time to build infrastructure
 tippaniyan According to the report, Sweden's municipalities are investing in future technology, such as automated vacuum systems in residential areas that will not require litter transportation, as well as underground container systems that will make roads litter transport and odor free

 This way has been suggested by former Justice Markandey Katju
 unhone maharashtra ke rajyapal se apil kii he ki wo samvidhan kii anuchhed 161 ke tahat sanjay dutt ko maaf kar den
 Read when and when Sanju Baba has gone, the President of Jailpress Council of India and former Justice Markandey Katju has written a letter to the Governor of Maharashtra, Sankaranarayanan
 jisamen apil kii gai he ki sanjay dutt kii sajaa maaf kar diya jaae
 Former Justice Markandey Katju's letter There is no doubt that Sanjay Dutt has committed the offense of possessing arms without a license but for that Sanjay Dutt has been facing mental punishment for twenty years
 is dauraan unhone kaaphi pareshaani kaa saamana kiya he
 Apart from this, Sanjay Dutt has also spent 18 months in jail
 'majboot' sanjay dutt ko SC kaa faisla he sweekaar
 
 
 The biggest thing is that Sanjay Dutt has not been convicted for any role in the 1993 bomb blasts
 unhen supreme court ne bhi arms act ke tahat nunatam sajaa sunai he
 Sanjay Dutt got married a few years ago and also has two young children
 unke pita ne bhi samaaj kii bahut seva kii he
 In such a situation, Sanjay Dutt should be pardoned under Article 161 of the Constitution
 kya he anuchhed 161anuchhed 161 ke tahat rajyapal kisi bhi sajayaftaa mujrim kii sajaa ko kam kar sakate hai, badal sakate hai yaa phir khatm kar sakate hai
 There is an atmosphere of despair in Sanjay Dutt's family
 unke vakil supreme court main purnvichaar yachika daakhil karne kii baat kah rahe hai
 Now the letter of Justice Katju also raised an expectation in the Dutt family

 tippaniyan At the same time, the dealership agreement for six pumps of Rajdhani has been canceled
 maamla court main hone kii vajah se companiyon ne inhen kabje main nahin liya he
 The action has been taken after BPCL company chief manager (public relations) Sundararajan said that the STF had raided seven pumps in Lucknow simultaneously and installed a remote device in the dispenser machine
 (hedline ke alaava, is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he, yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he
 ) vahiin rajdhani ke chah panpon kaa dilarship agreement nirast kiya gaya he
 As the matter is in court, companies have not captured them
 bipisiel company ke chif manager (public relation) sundarrajan ne bataaya ki estf ne lakhanu ke saat panpon par ek saath chhapemari kar dispencer mashin main remote divaais lagaakar gadabadi karne ke khel ko pakadaa tha, jiske baad yah karrwai kii gai he

 We will do what is in our national interest and part of that strategic partnership is to respect the potential of each country and the national interest of the other

 He said issues such as energy, trade issues, Afghanistan, the Gulf and the indo-pacific region were discussed with Pompeo
 aatankwaad par jaishankar ne kaha ki unhone trump prashasan ke majboot samarthan ke liye prashansa vyakt kii he
 Pompeo arrived here on Tuesday

 Pompeo's visit comes ahead of a meeting between US President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Modi on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Osaka, Japan
 kendriya sankhyikee ayog ke purv pramukh pisi mohanan ne achaanak 28 janvari ko pad chhod diya
 He told NDTV that the government did not release the NSSO (national Sample Survey Organization) report on employment
 un par pad chhodane ke liye dabaav banaaya
 He claimed that the commission was gradually pushed aside
 unhone kaha ki jab NSSO kii report ai or hamane use 5 disambar ko apruve kiya to vah jari ho gai
 He said that the government's claim that it is a draft report is false
 ek baar report ko ayog apruve kar detaa he to vah final report hoti he
 You cannot say that it will now be approved by the government
 jab aap shabd 'apruve' kaa upyog karte hai to usase vishwasaneeyata kaa prashn paidaa hota he

 The government should focus on the issues and improve the system
 or mere saath istipha dene vaali minakshi ne bhi yahi baat kahi he
 He said that it was important to maintain the sanctity of the commission and the Niti Aayog should not be involved
 iskaa matlab he ki sankhyikee ko sarkaar se swatantra rakhaa jaae
 It should be published objectively
 aadhikarik aankadon ke kuch mul siddhant hai jinhen sarkaar ne 2016 main adhishuchet kiya he, or yah bahut spasht rup se kaha gaya he ki aankade puri tarah se swatantra hone chahie
 The Commission ensures that this happens

 It is important for the system to maintain the reliability of statistical data
 unhone kaha ki niti ayog kii isamen sanlagnta bahut jaruri nahin he

 Irregular acquisition of public money, this system will not be accepted: PM @narendramodi An appeal i also want to ensure that the responsibility of maintaining rules and intentions in various financial institutions, which have been given the responsibility to fulfill their duty faithfully
 visheshkar jinhen nigaraanee or monitoring kii jimmedaari saunpi gai he: PM @narendramodi Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni and chief selector k Srikkanth had said before the start of the two-test series against South Africa that they would miss the experience of Rahul Dravid, the 'wall' of Team India in the middle-order and had already sampled it Got to see in the test
 dakshin africa ke pehali ghoshit pari chah wicket par 558 ran ke jawaab main bhartiya team pehali pari main 233 ran ke andar simat gayi or jiske baad mejabaan team phalo aan khilne utari or do wicket ganvaa baithi
 He was never dropped from the Test team in Dravid's 139 Test career
 dravid ne 1996 main test karier kaa aagaaj kiya tha or uske baad se vah keval ek match main hi nahin khel paye the kyonki 2005 main srilanka ke khilaaf ahmedabad test main unhe pet kii samasya ke kaaran aspataal main bhartee karaayaa gaya tha
 Prior to this, Dravid played 93 matches in a row, making him the leading player after his debut
 purv captain mohinder amarnath dravid ko number teen kaa sarvshereshth ballebaaj maanate hai
 He said, "he is definitely the best number three batsman in the Indian team
 is number par ballebaaji karnaa aasaan nahin hota
 This is a very important place for the team
 vah kisi bhi gendbaaj ke khilaaf apana wicket bachaaye rakhte hai, jisase duusare chor ke ballebaaj ko bhi madad milti he
 'dravid is the best batsman to play at number three for India and he averages 55 at this position
 71 he
 He has scored 8970 runs in 113 Tests at this place and his highest score is 270
 bangladesh ke khilaaf mirpur main duusare test ke dauraan shahadat hossain ke bounsar se dravid ke jabade main fracture ho gaya tha or vah apana 29waan test shatak jamaakar 111 ran par ritred hart ho gayi the
 Due to injury, he will not play in a single match of the Test series against South Africa
 unke march main indian premier lig ke tisare charan tak feet hone kii ummid he
 The absence of 'wall' made Team India very heavy because the number three holds a very important position in the team's batting and in such a situation, the result is bound to be affected if the team's specialist batsman is injured
 dravid 19 vibhinn jodidaron ke saath 80 se zyada shatkeey saajhedaariyaan nibhaa chuke hai or yah bhi ek vishwa ricard he
 The veteran batsman scored 53 in 139 Tests
 75 ke ausat se 11395 or 339 vanade main 39
 Has scored 10765 runs at an average of 43
 dravid test cricket main 11,000 ran kaa aankada paar karne vaale master ballebaaj sachin tendulkar ke baad duusare bhartiya or vishwa ke paanchaven antarrashtriya khilaadi hai
 Dravid is the only international batsman to score a century against all 10 Test playing nations
 amarnath ne kaha, ‘‘is number kii khaasiyat yah he ki is sthaan par ballebaaji karne vaale ko halaaton ke hisaab se khelnaa hota he or agar vah is bhoomika main khara utarataa he to vah shandaar he
 Dravid is therefore called 'the Wall'

 His army consisted of two commanders Amardas Chauhan and Bhagwandas Chauhan who fought on behalf of Shah Jahan

 In the area, people bother in many ways

 Very important and limited and thoughtful purchase was seen in the basket

 Proudly kept saying that we have not done dishonesty and are happy with that

 rishikesh mukherjee bhartiya film industry ke sabase ahale darje ke film nirdeshak ke rup main jane jate hai
 He made films ranging from small issues at home to sensitive issues of society
 magar rishikesh mukherjee kii ek khaas baat thi ki unhone apni adhikansh filmon ko darshane kaa mizaaj hameshaa halkaa hi rakhaa
 Too dark they didn't take any film
 is vajah se bhale hi unhen sathyajith re, rithwik ghatak, adur gopalkrishnan jaise film nirdeshkon kii list main naa rakhaa jaae magar ve apane aap main bemisaal film nirdeshak rahe hai
 His visionary thinking was clearly visible in his films
 tabhi to ve golmaal main bhavani prasad ke rup main utpal dutt ke kirdaar ko mukammal kar paae yaa anand main hansate muskuraate ek biimaar shaks kaa kirdaar jise rajesh khanna ne play kiya tha
 He made his own kind of cinema, which the indebted Bollywood will always be
 kamedi filmon ke jariye kis tarah logon ko sikh di ja sakati he aisa rishikesh mukherjee se pehle kisi ne nahin kiya
 This was Rishi da's original style
 rishikesh mukherjee kaa janm 30 sitambar, 1922 ko kolkata main hua tha
 He died on 27 August 2006 in Mumbai
 1957 main musafir film se unhone apane kariyar kii shuruyaat kii
 The film had Dilip Kumar and Kishore Kumar in the lead roles
 vahiin bahut kam logon ko hi ye baat pataa hogi ki unhone 1998 main jhooth bole kaua kaate naam se ek film banaai thi
 Anil Kapoor and Juhi Chawla were in the cast of this film
 yahi film unke kariyar kii aakhri film rahi
 His dedication to making films made him extremely special
 rishikesh mukherjee kii punyatithi par bataa rahe hai unke dwaara banaai gai kuch khaas filmein
 1- Musafir - His first film was Musafir and was equally special
 is film main unhone kai alag alag kahaniyon ko lekar film banaai thi
 The film was produced in parts
 kamaal ke thotproces ke saath bani is film main kishor kumaar, suchithra sen or dilip kumaar lead role main the
 Rishi da's first film was such that this type of film was never made in Bollywood till that time
 2- aashirwad-aashirwad film ko rishi da ne dada muni yani ashok kumaar ke kariyar kii sabase behtareen film bana di
 Ashok Kumar's character tells the story of a person who is full of art and spiritually spiritual
 magar halaat kii maar ke kaaran use apane jivan kaa adhikansh samay jail main bitaana padataa he
 Ashok Kumar's journey in the film can really bring tears to anyone's eyes
 3- satyakam-dharmendra, sharmila tagore or sanjeev kumaar ke abhinay se saji ye film clasik filmon main gini jaati he
 Different shades of relationships are shown in the film, which make you very emotional at times
 dharmendra ne is film main kamaal kii acting kii thi
 4- Anand - Who can forget this film
 yahi wo film thi jisane rajesh khanna ko superstar bana diya
 The character who plays his laugh in the film manages to take everyone's heart
 saath hi isi film ne sadi ke mahanayake amitabh bachchan ke kariyar kii neenv bhi rakhi thi
 The film is timeless and its dialogues are very famous even in today's generation
 5- guddi-bade hi rer vishay par rishi da ne ye film banaai thi
 Apart from Rishi Da, no one can think of making a film on such an issue and has been so beautiful
 rishi da ne kaaphi pehle hi darshakon ko bataa diya tha ki sach kitna alag hota he
 Many times the person gets so absorbed in his thoughts that he starts to feel the same truth
 filmein kaise asal jivan nahin or asal jivan kitna alag he nadaan guddi ke drushtikon se ye rishi da ne is film main samajhaayaa tha
 6- Chef - This film was a mirror of the stories of the family
 kaise choti-choti baton par ham ek duusare se munh phula kar baith jate hai or rishton ke vaastavik saundarya kii andekhi kar dete hai
 But time knows when and how to explain the importance of relationships
 vahiin rajesh khanna ke yayavari kirdaar ko gadhana bhi itnaa aasaan nahin
 a servant has made him through circumstances or he is a God-sent messiah who arrives as a house-to-house servant, and turns away the love-mongers like malaise, malice, jealousy into love to keep going, Find another house where there is a lack of love and need
 7- arjuna pandit-sanjeev kumaar ne is film main arjuna pandit kaa lead role play kiya
 The character of the film was so strong that it could not remain without being affected by it
 sanjeev kumaar ne kaaphi parafaction ke saath is role ko play kiya
 How they transform from an irritable, strident and stone hearted person into a human being who dives into the ocean of knowledge and continues to make people luminous even after being a modest servant
 arjuna pandit kaa ye badlaav dil ko chhu lene vaala he
 Kannan Gopinathan, who quit the IAS job after being angered by the restrictions imposed in Kashmir, said on Sunday that the people of the valley should be persuaded about Article 370, but it could not happen because they were not given a chance to express their views
 kashmir main "abhivyakti kii swatantraaa ke hanan" ke khilaaf apane vichaar prakat karne ke liye kannan ne naukari se istife kaa daawa kiya he
 Gopinathan (32), a 2012 batch officer, came into the limelight when he took part in relief and rescue operations with volunteers by hiding his identity during the 2018 Kerala floods
 sangh shasit pradeshon daman or div tathaa daadaraa evam nagar haveli ke urja vibhaag main sachiv rahe gopinathan ne pichley buudhvaar ko istipha de diya tha
 There was no mention of the Kashmir issue in his resignation
 gopinathan ne ravivaar ko kaha, "main abhivyakti kii swatantraaa ke apane adhikaar kaa istemaal karnaa chahta hum lekin seva main rahete mere liye aisa karnaa naammumkin tha
 It has many rules and regulations
 " kerala ke kottayam jile ke nivasee gopinathan ne kaha ki anuchhed 370 kaa nirasan "chuni hui sarkaar kaa adhikaar he" lekin loktantr main logon ko aise faislon par pratikriya dene kaa adhikaar he
 Gopinathan told PTI, "people are not allowed to react to it even after 20 days of taking a decision on Kashmir and it is not acceptable in the democratic system
 nijee taur par, main ise sweekaar nahin kar sakaa saath hi aise samay main apni sevaayen bhi jari nahin rakh saktaa tha
 "he said," This is not something that i can accept in my country
 mujhe pataa he ki meri sweekruti se koi fark nahin padataa, lekin main yah jaahir karnaa chahta tha ki yah sahi nahin he
 We should allow them freedom of expression
 agar unhen yah pasand nahin he to ham unhen samajhane kii koshish kar sakate hai
 We cannot convince them by shutting down and stopping to express further thoughts
 " Before reading further, understand two things
 pehali baat, apana kaha kabhi-kabhi khud ko lag jaataa he, or duusari baat jis cheez ko zyada sir chadhaao, ek din wo gale jarur padati he
 The boomerang is unique, it comes back in reverse, when Arvind Kejriwal told the people of Delhi that if you see anyone doing anything wrong, then you should record it, sting it, and at that time they did not think they were throwing the boomerang
 
 tab kise pataa tha ek din unki yahi baat unke liye musiibat sabit hogi
 Today people are bringing audio recordings, showing video recordings
 baithkon ke mudde-phone par kii baaten sab jagajaahir ho rahi hai, har koi har taraf aam aadmi party kaa sting oparation karne main laga he
 Kejriwal himself may not be convinced that people can take his 'recorded record' thing so seriously
 duusari baat ko samajhane kii koshish karen,aam aadmi partike netaaon kii shuru se aadat rahi he, camere ko tarjeeh dene kii
 As soon as the camera came in front, they would start speaking in order to capture more and more footage, then even if in camera fascination they forget that the same thing has been repeated since the Anna movement
 tivi par shuru-shuru main ye sab dekhnaa-sunanaa bada acha lagata, ridh kii haddi main gulabi gudagudi hoti, dhire-dhire in sab baton se ub hone lagi jaisaa ek-dedh saal ke relationships ke baad garlfriend ke ‘or sunaao’ ‘khaanaa khaaya mere babu ne’ vaale massej se hone lagati he aam aadmi kaa baton se mohabhang hua or aam party kaa camere se, camera prem ab sirdard sabit ho rahaa he, aam aadmi party ke kisi netaa ke paas camera le jaakar dekhie sting oparation kii dehshat itani bhar chuki he ki unki cheekh nikal jaayegi
 It is not that the party is not looking for ways to get out of these mess, which party can bear Kumar Vishwas for so many days, can make Ashish Khaitan a leader, he can do anything
 sting oparations kaa kahar jhel rahi partydamage control main lag gai, or unke haath ai he market main nokia 1100 ke ri-loch kii khabar
 Leftovers in the party (leftovers mean those leaders who are not writing open letters nowadays, are not quarreling on Twitter, are not doing any new sting themselves and are writing the most special mile long blogs and not telling the world Darun grief!) The leaders have decided that everyone in the party should be caught holding the Nokia 1100, provided it does not have any recording facilities once it is back in the market
 saare netaaon-vidhayakon or kaaryakartaaon ko hidaayat di gai he ki ricarding kii suvidha se las saare gagetts wo party karyaalayon main jald se jald jamaa kar den
 If someone finds a device that can save images or sounds, it will be removed from the party as an anti-party act
 aam aadmi party main sadsyta lene ke liye nae dishanirdesh jari kar die gaye hai, party kii sadsyta lene vaale har kaaryakrtta ko shapathpatr par yah ghoshnaa kerani hogi ki uske paas aisa koi gajet nahin he jiske boote kal ko sting kiya ja sake, party main aane vaale har sadsy ko jhaadu topi ke saath-saath nokia 1100 bhi diya jayega
 Removed the car's number plate, tried to insure it, and when it didn't work out, Mercedes left to sell the car to the scrap
 
 
 lekin isi bich police ke haath lag gaye
 This is the story of the Mercedes hit and run case of Paschim Vihar in Delhi

 BJP said that DMK chief Stalin refused to call Congress President Rahul Gandhi as Prime Ministerial candidate at Mamta Banerjee's rally in Kolkata, which shows that he has withdrawn from his earlier stand
 bataa den ki kuch din pehle stallin apni party kii ore se congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ko piem narendra modi ko haraane kii kaabiliyat rakhane vaala bataa chuke hai
 Along with this, he also called Rahul Gandhi a candidate for the post of PM

 However, when Stalin was asked on Sunday, he said that he was firm on his stand to make Rahul Gandhi the Prime Ministerial candidate

 On these allegations, Stalin said that he had proposed Rahul Gandhi as PM in his party's program, while many opposition parties were involved in the Kolkata rally
 unhone kaha, "vah diemke kaa kaarykram tha jahaan hamen puraa adhikaar tha or hamane rahul gandhi ke naam kaa prastaav kiya kyonki tamilnadu ke logon ko ummid he or isamen kya galat he
 "according to Stalin, no party leader in Kolkata has said that he made a mistake by announcing Gandhi's name for the prime ministerial candidate

 Pleased with US President Donald Trump's mediation offer to resolve the Kashmir issue, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said on Tuesday that the contentious issue between the two neighbors should not be resolved bilaterally
 can
 bharat or pakistan ke bich kashmir mudde par trump (donald Trump) dwaara madhyasth banane kii peshkash kiye jane ke kuch hi ghante baad khan kaa yah bayaan saamne aayaa he
 Significantly, during the meeting at the White House, the two leaders discussed various issues including the Afghanistan peace process
 vahiin, bharat sarkaar ne trump (donald Trump) ke is daawey ko sire se khaarij kiya he ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ne unase kashmir mudde par madhyasthata karne kaa anurodh kiya he
 Imran Khan, who went on a three-day trip to America, welcomed the move of the trump
 america ke fox news se imran khan ne kaha, ‘‘dwipaksheeya tareeke se ham kabhi (kashmir vivaad) nahin sulajhaa sakenge
 "hours after the first meeting with Trump at the Oval Office, the Prime Minister of Pakistan said that there was a time when General (pervez) Musharraf and Prime Minister of India (atal Bihari) Vajpayee were, at that time we came very close to resolving the Kashmir issue
 Had gone
 lekin uske baad se ham do alag-alag dhruvon par hai or mujhe vaaki lagata he ki bharat ko baatcheet kerani chahie
 America can play a big role in this
 raashtrapati trump vaaki mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaa sakate hai
 Subsequently when the anchor of Fox News read India's statement that India has always been of the view that all the pending issues with Pakistan will be resolved bilaterally, Khan said that we are 1 of this earth
 30 arab logon kii baat kar rahe hai
 Think if this issue is resolved then what will be the peace of peace
 is baat se sire se inkaar karte hue ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ne kabhi bhi kashmir par america madhyasthata kii baat kahi he, bharat ne somvaar ko kaha ki pakistan ke saath kisi prakaar ke sambandh ke liye seemaa paar se aatankwaad kaa band hona anivaary he
 The Simla Agreement and the Lahore Proclamation provide the basis for resolving all issues between India and Pakistan in a bilateral manner
 imran khan ne trump kii tippanee kaa swaagat karte hue kaha ki raashtrapati, main aapako bataa saktaa hum ki abhi agar aap madhyasthata karke is mudde ko sulajhaa sakate hai to aapako arabon logon kii duaen milengi
 In response to another question, Khan said that if India destroys its nuclear weapons, Pakistan will also eliminate them
 unhone kaha ki haa, kyonki parmaanu yuddh koi vikalp nahin he
 The idea of nuclear war between Pakistan and India is also going to ruin itself because our borders are interlinked for two and a half thousand miles
 imran khan ne kaha ki mujhe lagata he ki upmahadweep main logon main aisi bhaavana he ki farvari main kuch ghatnaayen hui thim or seemaa par phir se tanaav hua
 So people have this feeling and that's why i asked President Trump if he would like to play this role
 america duniya kaa sabase shaktishaalee desh he, ekmaatr aisa desh he jo kashmir mudde ko sulajhane ke liye pakistan or bharat ke bich madhyasthata kar saktaa he
 Imran Khan said that for the last 70 years we have not been able to live like civilized neighbors only because of Kashmir

 In the aarushi-hemraj murder case, the problems of the Talwar couple acquitted by the Allahabad High Court have increased once again

 Despite all this, still mystery
 puraa desh ek shahari parivaar main is vicitra aparaadh katha kii har baariki par najar rakhata rahaa he
 Difficulty in analyzing chance-a-crime for a crime expert is due to lack of knowledge of the area of doubt — such as its geography, sociology, history, popular culture, or employment modalities
 aise main koi aparaadh visheshgy apni jaankaree ke anusaar hi samajhadaar yaa naasamajh ho saktaa he
 The analysis of crime in the aarushi-hemraj murder case is still dependent on circumstantial evidence
 isliye samay bitne ke saath itane tarah kii kahaniyaan or vishleshan aa gaye ki is gutthi kii har kadi isaki samiksha karne vaale ke nazariye main feet baith jaati he
 According to the CBI, the condition of the parents' involvement in the crime indicates that they could not explain why the lock of Aarushi's room was open that night

 'but according to Nupur, that was the biggest mistake of his life
 unhone kaha, 'us raat shaayad main chaabi daravaaje main hi chhod ai thi

 This flat had many doors and windows
 usamen lakdi ke daravaaje ke saath lohe ke gril vaala darwaja or phir ek bahari lohe ke gril vaala darwaja laga tha
 Hemraj's room was inside the flat, right next to the main gate
 chat bhi talwaar parivaar kii hi thi jisaki seedhi baahar ke kaaman aria se jaati thi
 Aarushi's room was next to her parents' room on the right
 uske kamare main har raat baahar se taala laga diya jaataa tha
 Hemraj had all the keys except Aarushi's room
 yahaan kuch sutara khulte hai jo aapako pareshaan karte hai
 So, what would have happened that night? The address is as follows

 She was also repeatedly playing bells and an iron outer grill
 aakhirkaar noopur aankh malate hue lakdi kaa darwaja kholti hai or andar ke lohe ke gril se puuchhati hai ki hemraj kahaan he? bharti kahati he, 'mujhe nahin pataa
 Will you throw the key down? ' When she came to see that the iron grill outside was not closed
 lekin bheetar kaa gril darwaja baahar se band he
 When he entered the house, Rajesh and Nupur were crying
 noopur uske seene se lag gayi or rote hue kaha, 'aarushi ke kamare main jaao or dekho ki kya hua
 'bharti goes inside and when Nupur removes the sheet, Bharti sees a thin stream of blood on Aarushi's throat
 noopur ro rahi he, 'dekho hemraj ne kya kiya
 'bharti asks,' Should i call neighbors? ' Nupur says, 'yes, call
 'samay- subah 6

 50 baje tak police aa jaati he or 8 baje tak media
 Aarushi's body is taken for postmortem at around 9 pm
 kuch vyaktiyon kii bhayankar bhuulon ne samuhik gadbadiyon ko badhaava diya
 For example, consider the story of Chunnilal Gautam, photographer and finger print collector of UP police
 gautam ne us subah anginat tasviren or ungaliyon ke nishaan kii tasviren khinchin
 Yet 22 out of 24 finger print photos are blurred, 23 of their photos do not match the negatives

 The question arises why three bottles of Sula wine, Kingfisher beer and Sprite are lying in Hemraj's room? What is the case of three glasses? Why is Hemraj's bed folded such that three people are sitting on it? Why is there so much urine in Hemraj's bathroom? In the same way, cut-throat go to the roof with steps of blood stains
 vahaan yah dekhakar hairaan rah jate hai ki chat par khun se sane haath ke chhap hai, cooler main khun jaisaa laal pani he or kone main sadaandh martha ek shav padaa he, sir par vaise hi nishaan hai jaise aarushi ke sir par the or donon kaa galaa bhi ek hi tareeke se kaata gaya tha
 There are many scars on the body
 ve kehete hai, 'may kii garmi main do din tak kadi dhoop main rahane ke baad shav kii aisi haalat thi ki rajesh bhi hemraj kii pahchaan nahin kar paae
 'the investigation went on and on the morning of 23 May, Police IG Gurdarshan Singh declared that it is honor killing

 Story: This story begins from where the story of Bahubali 1 ended, and Sita aka Mahendra Baahubali (prabhas) tries to tell Katappa (satyaraj) how Maharaja Amarendra Bahubali (prabhas) was ultimately killed
 kahani flashbek main jaati he or us samay kaa zikr hota he jab mahishmati ke samrajya main amrendra bahubali kaa rajbhishek hone vaala hota he or log khush the, lekin ye baat bhallaal dev (rana daggubatti) ko bilkul bhi bardaasht nahin thi
 Due to which he plans to kill Amarendra Baahubali with his father, in which Katappa is put forward and betrays the queen Shivagami (ramya Krishnan) as well
 saath hi kahani main devsena (anoushka shetty) kii entry hoti he
 Now under which circumstances Bahubali is murdered, you will have to find out by watching the film, because this is a surprise which has been hidden by the makers for 2 years and opening it while writing the review here will not be a good job but just i would like to tell that you must have heard the jokes of Katappa and Bahubali, but you are also emotional during the filming of that scene
 khayr kahani aage badhati he, aakhirkaar bhallaal or bahubali ke bich prachand yuddh hota he
 Desh got the answer- Why did Katappa kill Bahubali? Know why you can watch the film? The story of the film is very good that keeps you hooked as well as the screenplay is strong
 film kaa diarection laajawab he or diarection ke saath-saath viefex jabardast he jo aapako 2di main 3di kaa anand detaa he
 And that's why the film is visually rich
 har ek seen main kuch na kuch khaas jarur dekhne ko miltaa he
 There is a very amazing filming that is less than what is praised

 Prabhas has done an excellent job physically, he also applauds, as well as the work of his opposite Rana Daggubatti, which is a compliment to you, which you also hate, as well as different forms of Ramya Krishnan and Anushka Shetty, Tamannaah Bhatia's might, Satyaraj's knocks and the rest of the characters are effortless acting, which is worth watching
 bahubali dekhne ke liye logon ne aise maangi chuttee, dekhen kuch phani LEAVE applicationspilma kaa sangeet or khaastaur par becoground score kamaal kaa he jo aapako baandhe rakhata he
 The story of the fiction through the film seems real, which is the victory of director SS Rajamouli in the twenty-first century
 climax kii jang ke dauraan tabadatod ection he jisaki pariklpana kar paanaa bhi mushkil he , taaliyon kii gadgadaahat theatre main goonjati he
 The weak Qian film has been dubbed in Hindi, due to which you do not get to see the regular lip sync and the song is someone else but the artist is seen shaking the lips in some other way, though such dubbed movies on TV There is a lot and now it is also habit, a few things are very less in front of the grandeur of this film
 box offisvaise trade ke mutabik bahubali ke donon parts kaa bajet lagbhag 400 karod kaa he or bahubali 1 ne pehle se hi aankadon ke mutabik 419 karod kaa bijness kar liya he
 By the way, Bahubali 1 had grossed about Rs 419 crore which was included in the list of top grosser along with 'dangal' and 'PK'
 oversij main bhi 'pike' or 'dangal' ne super bijness kiya tha, to ek tarah se number 1 par 'pike' , number 2 par 'dangal' or number 3 par 'bahubali' thi
 According to Overseas Distributors, the film can do $ 7-8 million in Hindi, Tamil and Telugu languages on the opening day

 It will be released in three languages tamil, Telugu and Hindi

 MP Sharad Tripathi is asking why his name was not mentioned in the inscription of a scheme
 isi baat ko lekar bijepi saansad sharad treepathi or bijepi vidhayak rakesh singh baghel ke bich kaha-suni hoti he or saasand sahab kah dete hai ki aapke jaise vidhayak paidaa kiye hai to vidhayak baghel ne pratikriya main kah diya ki juute maarenge
 Legislator Rakesh Singh starts throwing the bag at the bus after removing Sasand Tripathi shoe
 bachaav main vidhayak baghel ne bhi haathon se maarane kaa prayaas kiya magar saasand treepathi kii tarah ve badla nahin le paae
 MP Tripathi killed many shoes
 unhone un gaaliyon kaa bhi istamaal kiya, jinke shuru main maa or bahanon kaa zikr hota he
 We continue to face such abuses on social media every day
 saansad kaa juuta maarna mahaz uksaave kii karrwai nahin he
 Sasand was rather provoked
 ek vidhayak ko yah kahana ki tum jaise vidhayakon ko paidaa kiya he, yahi apmanjanak tha
 The mla's self-respect was attacked
 juuta maarane kii is ghatana kii ek or vyakhya zaruri he
 Where does the right to hit the shoe come from
 us jati ke ahankaar se aata he, jise lagata he ki aaj bhi sara samaaj uski paidaaish he
 He has produced
 juuta maarane kaa ahankaar puri tarah se jativaadee he
 a general study of where this phrase came from and for whom it will tell is a racist ego
 jila kaary yojana samiti kii baithak main tamaam afasaron ke bich naam nahin hone ko lekar juute kaa nikal aana, us ahankaar kaa nikal aana he jo paidaa hota he jatvaad ke ahankaar se
 The MP has not only demonstrated the arrogance and self-proclaimed authority of his caste, but has also insulted the legislature
 upi vidhansabha ke spikar ko apane vidhayak ke sammaan main saasand ke khilaaf karrwai karne kaa aadesh dena chahie
 Today, the Modi government's advertisement has appeared in many newspapers that the red light culture has been abolished
 aaj hi uttar pradesh ke sant kabir nagar se yah video aayaa he ki laal batti abhi khatm nahin hui he
 Sansand Tripathi should be sent for one year in the Bharatiya Janata Party's school of nationalism where lectures against casteism are given
 agar rashtrawaad kaa asar inhen par nahin hoga to kis par hoga
 There is tension at the border and mps are slapping the MLA
 is drishy se sena kaa manobal gir saktaa he
 At the moment the district administration can take a lesson from this incident
 ab se koi bhi baithak ho, jisamen vidhayak or saansad aane vaale hon, unke juute utarava liye jaaen
 The MLA and MP should be seated at a reasonable distance
 vidhayak or saansad ke bich kam se kam do daaroga kaa baitha hona zaruri he
 If four supporters stand behind the MP, then the same number of supporters should be allowed to stand behind the MLA

 This does not mean there should be an exemption for carrying a pistol

 Shame on you, because that's what you can do

 But Iqbal is so exhausted that after the completion of the shoe running, the police officers come and separate the two
 koi vahaan tay nahin kar paaya ki roak dene par kiski taraf se ection ho jaataa he
 Review this development of Indian politics as well
 kaayade se sharad treepathi kaa tikat kaat dena chahie
 He should be kicked out of the party and put his shoe outside the office of the party that if someone uses it again, it will be like Sharad Tripathi
 agar sharad treepathi ke khilaaf karrwai nahin hui, to phir juuta maarna raajnneeti main pratishthit ho jayega
 Sharad Tripathi should also remove the shoe from his feet and brain
 paanv se pehle dimaag se juuta nikaal dena chahie, kyonki juuta maarane ke khyaal kaa pehla signal us dimag se aata he jo samaaj ke sankeern sanskaron se bana hota he
 When there is a shoe in the brain, then only comes a shoe in the hand
 ham sabhi kai baar juuta maarane kii baat kah dete hai
 It should be avoided
 na khud ko juute maarane kii baat kehani chahie or na hi kisi or ko juute maarane kii baat kehani chahie

 nahin bolnaa chahie
 Neither should it be spoken nor should it be removed
 na chauraahey par na tirahe par
 Let us understand by an example
 pitrusatta sirf purushon main nahin hoti, wo auraton main bhi ghusi rahati he
 Therefore, the fight against it has to be fought by men as well as women

 phir dobaaraa jab sunwaayee shuru hui to unhone kaha ki raksha mantralay ke purv karmchaaree yaa vartmaan karmchaaree ne chori kii he, isaki jaanch ho rahi he
 Justice Joseph asked that if corruption has been done in the Rafale deal, can the government take refuge behind the Official Secret Act? No
 atarni general, ham jaanch kar rahe hai, aapraadhik maamla he, oficial sikret act ke khilaaf he
 Justice KM Joseph- Suppose a big crime has happened, will you defend under the guise of national security? Justice KM Joseph - According to your argument, even in the Bofors case, the Criminal Court does not find any document
 yah cese band ho janaa chahie? atarni general- supreme court ke har vaakya ko asthir karne main istamaal kiya ja saktaa he
 Prashant Bhushan questioned that no police station has been registered on such a serious issue

 Attorney General KK Venugopal said that a CBI inquiry cannot be ordered
 isse desh ko baari nuksaan hoga
 Venugopal said that action should be taken against the Hindu newspaper under the Official Secret Act, but the Supreme Court did not say anything on it
 kyonki agali sunwaayee 14 march ko he
 During this debate, the court said strong words about Aam Aadmi Party MP Sanjay Singh

 bangladesh ne na keval menuphaccharing or export par aadhaarit utpaadan (GDP) or rojgaar main vruddhi ke saath sanrachanaatmak badlaav kiye hai, balki usne saamaajik sanketakon, aay str or gramin ilaakon main udhyamita ke str main bhi ullekhneey badhat hasil kii he
 Small finance institutions (mfis) have played an important role in these
 vishwa bank ke saal 2014 ke ek adhyayan main, jisamen micro credit kaaryakramon ke long turm asar ko dekha gaya he, yah nishkarsh saamne aayaa ki in kaaryakramon se gramin pariwaron ko zyada kamaane or zyada khapat main madad mili he
 Not only this, it has also contributed to the reduction of total poverty by more than 10 percent in the decade 2000 to 2010
 isse bangladesh ko aay asamanta ko badhane se rokane main madad mili he jo ki kai vikasshil deshon main dekha ja rahaa he
 How Bangladesh did microfinance, or small finance institutions in Kamalbad Bangladesh, started in the 1970s in which Grameen Bank and BRAC (formerly Bangladesh Rural Advance Committee) played an effective role
 laghu karj kaaryakramon ke dwaara nichle str ke logon ke aarthik or saamaajik vikaas kii disha main prayaas ke liye 2006 main gramin bank or uske sansthaapak mohammad unuus ko nobel shanti puraskaar se nawaja gaya tha
 Later, other organizations such as the Association of Social Advancement (ASA) also joined the campaign and the rural social and economic landscape changed completely
 singapore management uniwarsity ke saal 2008 ke ek paper main is baat par roshni daali gai he ki gramin bank or BRAC jaisi sansthaaon ne yah kamaal kaise kar dikhaaya
 Accordingly, Yunus developed a self-sustainable system of lending and borrowing at least by default and at least by default, with an average loan repayment rate of 97 per cent
 unhone gramin mahilaon par khaas jor diya or unhen is baat ke liye sangathit kiya ki ve kaarobaar ke liye samuhik jimmedaari len
 The good thing in this was that not only did every member join the loan, many used to deposit their extra money
 unuus ahamed kii mahatvapurn bhoomikayunus ne aise fund ke dam par kai tarah ke kaarobaari udhyam khadey kiye, munafa yaa bina munaafe vaale saamaajik abhiyaan ke saath, nitvir (kapadon kii bunai) se lekar software tak
 His efforts, 'led to a wave of entrepreneurship in the rural areas of Bangladesh, which effectively helped to change the structure of Bangladesh's rural economy
 ’ yahi nahin, unuus dwaara shuru kii gai diggaj telecom company gramisephone ne gramin bangladesh main sanchaar kranti laa di
 Similarly, BRAC also played an important role in transforming rural Bangladesh
 magsese puraskaar vijeta fazal hasan aabid dwaara sthapit is sanstha ne un sudur se sudur gaanvon kaa bhi punarniman kar diya, jahaan swasthya ke maamle main bhi sarkari sahaayta nahin mil paati thi
 This led to a significant reduction in the infant mortality rate
 aabid ne kai udhyamon kii funding or sthapana bhi kii, jinke dwaara resham utpaadan, deyari, hechari or anya kaarobaar kiye ja rahe hai
 They are creating employment and income for the rural poor
 dhaka uniwarsity ke professor saleem rehaan ne kaha ki 75 fisadi se zyada microfinance sansthaaen saamaajik vikaas kaaryakramon main lagi hai, jinka mukhya jor shiksha, swasthya, jal evam swatchta, mahila shashaktikaran or aarthik vikaas par he
 Why the change could not happen in India, then the question arises that despite the presence of large scale microfinance institutions in India, why such a change could not happen here? This curiosity demands a study
 ICRIER kii professor nisha taneja kahati hai ki bangladesh main ye sansthaaen jis tarah se jamini str par judi hui hai, logon kaa bharosa jeeta he or diphalt ko hatotsahit kiya he, vah asaadhaaran he
 It can also be implemented in India, but it requires a lot of vision and commitment
 mahila shashaktikaran or saamaajik badlaavabangladesh ke micro-finance sansthaaon ke kaam main mahilaayein centre bindu rahi hai
 Professor Kaushik Basu underlined this aspect while explaining the economic progress of Bangladesh
 vah likhte hai ki gramin bank or BRAC jaisi micro finance sansthaaon kii shuruyaat se or haal main sarkaar dwaara shuru kiye gaye kaam kii vajah se bangladesh ne ladakiyon ko shikshit karne main mahatvapurn pragati kii he, isaki vajah se mahilaon ko pariwaron or janata main behatar aawaaj mili he
 a 2019 study by the World Bank stated that Bangladesh has achieved significant success in many aspects of gender equality, creating opportunities for women and girls in every sphere of life — a reduction in fertility rates, Gender equality in schools has increased and in the last decade, the path of millions of women working in the textile sector has been opened
 in sabakaa asar yah he ki aaj vahaan ladakiyon ke liye schuli shiksha puri karne or 60 saal tak jeene kaa ladakon se behatar mauka dikh rahaa he
 It further states that the labor participation rate (FLFP) for women 15 years and above has increased from 26 percent in 2003 to 36 percent in 2016
 iske vipareet dakshin asia ke zyaadaatar anya deshon main is dar main giravat ai he
 For example, according to undp's 2018 updated Human Development Indices and Indicators, the FLFP rate in India was 27 in 2017
 2 fisadi hi tha, jabaki bangladesh main yah 33 fisadi tha
 The share of women in Bangladesh's national parliament has also increased (50 seats are reserved for women there) and 19 of 2017
 4 fisadi ke kshetreey ausat ke mukaable 20
 Was 3 percent
 us saal bhartiya sansad main mahilaon kaa pratinidhitiv 11
 It was only 6 percent
 ab bangladesh main zyada mahilaayein jameen kii maalik hai or unka kheton, pashuon, makaanon, gaiyr krishi bhoomi par zyada aarthik niyantran hasil he
 The World Bank report said, 'now the attitude of the society has changed in terms of women owning property, which is a good sign for women to move forward
 ' iske peeche tark yah he ki mahilaon ke aarthik shashaktikaran se garibi ghatati he, kyonki ve bacchon or samudaayon par zyada kharch karti hai
 All this is evident from the improvement in health and other indices there
 yuandipi kii 2018 kii report ke anusaar bangladesh main jivan pratyaasha dar 72
 8 which is 68 of India
 8 se behatar (saal 2017 main) he
 Similarly, the newborn mortality rate in Bangladesh (less than 5 years, per thousand, year 2016) 34
 2 he, jabaki bharat main yah 43 he
 Even Bangladesh is ahead of India in the major indices of education
 oktober main jab global hangar index (GHI) kii tivrata report jari kii gai thi, tab se bangladesh lagaataar bharat se behatar sthiti main he
 Bangladesh 25 in this report
 8 ank hasil hue hai (117 deshon main se use 88veen ranking hasil hui he), jabaki bharat kaa ank 30
 3 is (ranked 102)
 GHI ke dwaara 0 se 100 ke paimaane par kisi desh main bhukh or kuposhan ke str ko mapa jaataa he
 The lower the marks a country gets, the less the intensity of hunger and malnutrition is there
 haalanki bangladesh or bharat, donon isamen lagaartaar ‘gambhir’ vaali shrenee main bane hue hai
 The graph below shows what has been the position of India and Bangladesh in the GHI issue since the year 2000
 ek or mahatvapurn report gat oktober maheene main hi ai he- world bank kii pehali human capital index (HCI) or isamen bhi bharat se aage nikal gaya he bangladesh
 Through this index, the productivity of the next generation of workers is seen as a benchmark for full education and full health
 aisi arthvyavastha jisamen kisi ausat kaamgaar ko purna swasthya or purna shiksha hasil hoti he, use 1 ank hasil hota he
 However, this is not surprising, as Bangladesh has spent considerable resources for the development of its social sector (education, health, sports and women welfare etc
)
 uskaa kharch vitt varsh 2010 main jidipi ke 4
 9 in FY 2019, up from 4 per cent
 8 fisadi ho gaya he
 Money sent by migrants is the main carrier of development
 Another main carrier for the development of Bangladesh economy is the money sent by Bangladeshi migrants working abroad
 yah vitt varsh 2006 ke 4
 Has reached $ 15 billion in FY 2018 as against $ 8 billion
 pichley kai saal se yah bangladesh kii jidipi main 5 fisadi se upar bana hua he
 The graph which is showing a slight decrease in FY 2019, is because the figures are only till March 2019, while the financial year there is till June 30, 2019
 professor rehan kehete hai ki bangladesh main pichley chaar dashakon main videsh main karyrat bangladeshi pravaasiyon dwaara bheje jane vaale dhan (remitance) main kaaphi badhotaree dekhi gai he

 The statistics of the Ministry of Home Affairs itself are proving this
 aankaden bataate hai ki varsh 2011 se 2014 tak paramilitary force ke 368 javaanon nen aatmahatya kii
 January 2014 means that 15 soldiers have committed suicide in a month, but if we look at the number of soldiers who died during work in these three years, then it is a big shock
 is dauraan rajya police ke javaanon ke saath paramilitary force ke 371 jawan maare gaye
 Let us tell you that about 13 lakh paramilitary personnel are working across the country and the number of army personnel is many times more than these, but during this time there have been 265 suicide cases of army personnel

 bollywood staffkshay kumaaraki charchit film good news kaa trailor somvaar ko box offis par relies kar diya gaya he
 The trailer has received a good reaction on social media and has become increasingly viral
 haalanki film kaa trailor or poster relies hone ke baad ek sawaal jo ki adhiktar logon ko jehan main aa rahaa tha wo ye tha ki is film ke tital main news kii ssailing galat kyon likhi gai he?maaloom ho ki film ke naam kii ssailing Good News nahin balki Good Newwz he
 At the trailer launch event of the film, a user asked producer Karan Johar the question that you said that there is a story behind the wrong spelling of the name of the film
 kya aap us kahani ke bare main kuch bataanaa chahenge
 In response to this, Karan Johar said that in the creative world, there is a superstition about starting the name of films with a particular letter
 karan ne bataaya ki vah bhi aise hi andhvishwaas main fanse hue the or apni filmon kaa naam k se shuru kiya karte the
 Then some films were released which were titled k and had Kareena Kapoorbhi in it but despite this the film did not do well at the box office
 iske baad karan ne ye tay kiya ki shaayad ye sab baaten sirf unke dimag kii upaj hai or isamen koi hakeekat nahin he
 Karan Johar said that after many years he met Raj Mehta, who is very mad about everything
 unhone bataaya ki raaj ne film ke mujeec curator azim dayaani ke saath milakar kaha ki kya ve film ko a Good News naam de sakate hai
 In response, Karan Johar told him that it would be wrong English
 iske baad nirdeshak raaj or azim ek nayaa idia lekar aae or kaha ki ise Good Newwz naam dete hai
 View this post on Instagraminfact even some of the good movies don't even last for two days
 You try changing any number of spellings and venues but your bad time takes you down
 # Karanjohar changed the spelling of his film and even did the trailer at Fun Cinemas and not his regular Juhu PVR which was his lucky venue for all these years
 But he need not worry as he has # akshaykumar as that man is the current Harry Potter along with # ayushmankhurana of the box office
 # numerology # superstition # viralbhayani @viralbhayania post shared byviral Bhayani (@viralbhayani) onnov 18, 2019 at 1:40 am PST So spelling-karan Johar of the name of the changed film told that he too thought that if something goes wrong tomorrow All together will overthrow me, so i said that you should change the spelling
 karan ne bataaya ki haalanki ye vahiyaat he lekin unhone ek aisi ssailing banaai he jise sabhi ne sweekaar kiya he isliye mujhe koi dikkat nahin he

 mardaangi par sawaal uthe to purush jhooth kaa sahaara lete hai
 a recent study has shown that men do not refrain from lying about their height and sexual partners when it comes to masculinity
 is behad rochak study main kuch purushon par ek prayog kiya gaya or unase kaha gaya ki unhone strength parformens main kaaphi bura pradarshan kiya he
 In such a situation, to prove himself better, he cited his tall stature and also lied about his sexual partner

 Not only this, to prove his manhood he did the same thing
 vahiin duusari ore jin mardon kii mardaangi par koi sawaal nahin uthaaya jaataa he wo aisi baaten karne se bachate hai
 Psychologists believe that once a man's masculinity is questioned, he tries to prove it
 unki baton or harkaton main bhi wo ise sabit karne kii koshish karne lagate hai
 In this study on 100 people, these men were first told that their strength is less than others

 He increased his height by four to five inches and also said that he had many partners before

 One thing related to this study is also that in the houses where men are less educated and women spend the house, men are more violent in those houses
 aisa karke wo apnimardaangi sabit karne kii koshishkarte hai
 At the same time, another study also said that men usually look at science or engineering as a profession because they feel that they are better than women in terms of statistics

 aam aadmi party main mache ghamaasan or aarope-pratyaropon ke bich agar koi dal sabase zyada utsahit najar aa rahaa he to vah he bijepi
 The reason is that the infighting in the Aam Aadmi Party has not only given the BJP an opportunity to regain its lost ground in Delhi but has also dented the prospects of the Aam Aadmi Party in the upcoming assembly elections
 haal main hue emsidi chunaavon main jeet ke baad bijepi vaise bhi utsahit he or ab vidhansabha ke agle chunaav main dilli jeetne ke abhiyaan ko teji mil sakati he
 The BJP hopes to benefit from this boast in five more states besides Delhi
 1
 Gujarat is to be elected this year in the home state of PM Modi and Amit Shah
 arvind kejariwal or aam aadmi party pichley do saal se gujarat main chunavi ranneeti par kaam kar rahi he
 Especially on the issue of corruption, Kejriwal was seen to surround the BJP
 lekin ab khud par cash lene ke aaropon ke baad gujarat main party kii sambhaavnaaon ko bada jhatka lag saktaa he
 Apart from this, the Aam Aadmi Party in Gujarat also had an expectation from Patidar movement leader Hardik Patel but Hardik is now with Shiv Sena
 ye aam aadmi party ke liye rajya main dabl jhatka he
 2
 himachal pradeshgova or punjab main chunaav ladane ke baad aam aadmi party kii nigaah himachal pradesh par bhi he jahaan isi saal chunaav hone hai
 In the elections so far in Himachal Pradesh, the fight has been between the BJP and the Congress, but the Aam Aadmi Party is actively trying to take away the Congress land there
 aam aadmi party himachal main chunaav main utre lekin kamjor hokar to bijepi ko phayda ho saktaa he
 3
 rajasthanhaal main aam aadmi party ke netaa kumaar vishwaas jab party main naaraaz chal rahe the to unhen rajasthan kaa prabharee banaaya gaya he
 After Gujarat, the assembly elections in Rajasthan are the most important for the BJP in the coming times
 ab AAP main mache kalah se bijepi ke liye chunautiyaan bhi kam hongi
 4
 maharashtranitin gadakari kii companiyon ke maamle ko lekar maharashtra main bhrashtachar ko mudda banane kii shuruaati koshishon ke baad ab aam aadmi party khud ke ghamaasan se jujh rahi he
 People like Anjali Damania and Mayank Gandhi, who were among the early members of the party in Maharashtra, now appear to stand against Kejriwal's leadership
 aise main aane vaale vakt main bijepi ke liye mushkilen kam hongi
 5
 punjabapunjab main bhale hi bijepi kii sahyogi akali dal chunaav haar gai ho lekin bijepi ko apane liye agar rajya main bhavishya main jagah banani he to aam aadmi party main mache ghamaasan se use phayda ho saktaa he
 The Congress is now in state power and the Aam Aadmi Party stands in opposition by winning 20 seats, but the Punjab AAP unit also appears divided in the ruckus in the Aam Aadmi Party
 ghughghi se kaman lekar ab bhagwant maan ko de diya gaya he
 Earlier, 20 mlas under Ghughi's leadership wrote letters in favor of Kumar Vishwas
 punjab main bijepi ko apni jagah banane ke liye aap main padi foot se madad mil sakati he

 Today is the birthday of poet and critic Mrityunjay
 raajakmal prakaashan ne unki kitaab 'hindi aalochana main canan nirmaan kii prakriya' prakashit kii he
 Although Mrityunjaya has also been very famous for his poems, but his book of criticism is a very excellent book in itself
 is pustak main unhone hindi sahitya main pratimaanon ke gadhane kii prakriya par vistaar se charchaa kii he
 This book says that the canon-making process in Hindi criticism is deeply rooted in the debates of history
 lagbhag har aalochak ne apane samay-samaaj par tippanee kii he
 These comments are sometimes straightforward political, sometimes they look through criticism
 apane samay-samaaj main chal rahe navajagaran or hindi aalochana ke udbhav kaa sambandh bahut ghanaa he
 The process of canon-making has a long connection with our nation-building process
 jaise-jaise desh ban rahaa tha, vaise-vaise aalochana ke canan or unke aadhaar bhi badal rahe the
 
 
 
 baad iske aalochana ke canan-nirmaan kii prakriya marxvad ke samarthan or virodh kii dhuree par gatisheel rahi
 
 
 
 abhi hindi aalochana main canan-nirmaan ke lihaaj se asmita-vimarsh, stri or dalit-vimarsh mahatvapurn hai
 Critics associated with these are questioning the old canons and the processes of their construction
 ' is pustak main canan kii vyutpatti, itihaas, pashchimi aalochana main canan par hue vimarsh, or taduparant hindi aalochana main mishra-bandhu, ramachandra shukla, hajariprasad dvivedi, ramvilas sharma, muktibodh, namvar singh or nirmal verma se hote hue dalit tathaa stri-asmita ke vimarshon tak kii canan-nirmaan prakriya ko samajhane kii koshish kii gai he
 Book excerpt: The process of canon making in Hindi criticism Almost all the important books of history and criticism of Acharya Hazari Prasad Dwivedi came around 1940
 namvar singh ne apni pustak 'duusari parampara kii khoj’ main is dashak or agle 50 ke dashak kii swaabhaavik masti or fakkadpan ko dvivedi ji ke samgr rachanakarm or unke rachanakarm ke ek aadhaar ke rup main chihnit kiya he
 Dwivedi ji's Kabir is equipped with this clout
 unke 'kutj’, 'ashok ke phool’- sab is sarvanishtha fakkadpan ke sahchar hai
 But leaving aside the talk of 'poets of fun' and if the debate is focused on Dwivedi ji, then the question becomes important, which ground was working in making this puckishness? In the search for 'second tradition', he wrote: "in fact, in the fourth decade of the twentieth century, the rebellion had manifested itself in some form of clutter
 iskaa ek rup niraala ke 'kukuramutta’ [1940] ke badbolepan main he to doosraa rup rahul sankrutyaayan kii 'volga se ganga’ [1942] naamak kathakriti main he
 
 
 
 itihaaskaaron ke mutabik yah kaal ghor uthal-puthal or manthan kaa kaal tha
 The structure of Gandhia Yuga's idealism had risen in every sphere of life
 anek raaj-nitik or naitik adarsh sandigdh ho uthe the
 This is the period when the ideas of both Marx and Freud were simultaneously influencing and agitating the educated middle class of India
 duusare mahayuddh ke kaaran saamaanya jivan ke aarthik paksh par jo prabhaav padaa tha, usase asuraksha kii bhaavana or badi thi
 The problem of hindu-muslim unity also arose in the context of freedom struggle
 ’’namvar ji ne itihaaskaaron ke marfat jo vishleshan kiya he, use or vistaarit karne kii aavashyaktaa isliye he ki hajaari prasad dvivedi ko dekhne ke liye 40 ke dashak kii purvapithika ko dekhnaa aavashyak he
 Among the major questions of that period were the hindu-muslim question, which had become very powerful politically
 yah sawaal 30 ke dashak se hi, golmes sammelnon main pruthak nirvachan mandalon kii maang ke saath hi, or adhik gaharaa gaya tha
 By 40, the Hindu Mahasabha and the Muslim League had emerged as more autonomous powers
 isi prakriya kaa ek raktranjit rup 1940 ke saat saal baad hi vibhaajan, dangon or bhayaavah maanviya traasadee ke rup main hamaare saamne aata he; arthath jis daur main acharya dvivedi bhartiya samskruti kii avishuddhta par jor de rahe the, usee daur main bhartiya upnivesh ke raajnneetik patal par 'saanskrithik shuddhta’ kii fasal lahalha rahi thi
 Hazari Prasad Dwivedi was fighting it in his own way
 1940 tak aate-aate navajagaran kaa apana bauddhik taap kam ho chalaa tha or arya samaaj bhi pehle vaala arya samaaj nahin rah gaya tha
 In such a situation, the challenge was to find a solution to this question in front of a nation struggling for independence
 yahaan pakistani [tab bhartiya] lekhika mumtaj shah navaj kaa zikr akaaran nahin hoga
 Between 1943 and 1948 he wrote a novel - 'the Heart Divided'
 yahaan unhone hindu-musalamaanon ke tatkaaleen sambandhon main aa rahi saanskrithik daraaron ko bakhubi chihnit kiya he
 The dialogue of the characters in his novel evokes more contradictions and depths of the contradictions of the 30–40 environment
 "one young man said," Life has become impossible under Congress rule
 ham is tarah jinda nahin rah sakate
 You have to do something from the root
 chijen roj bigadati ja rahi hai
 
 
 
 sirf itnaa hi nahin, hamaare bacchon ko apane majahab or culture ke saare pratik chhodane ko majaboor kiya jaataa he
 They have to sing ‘vande Mataram’ instead of ‘aaslam-o-alayakum’, our old way of greeting
 ’
 
 
 Hindi has replaced Urdu, a thing called 'hindustani' is being run to mislead people
 usamen se bhi arabi or farsi ke harf baahar kiye ja rahe hai
 Perhaps the worst thing is the way the date books change
 musalmaan raajaaon-baadshahon ko behad galat tareeke se dikhaaya ja rahaa he
 
 
 "here the reference is to Gandhi's Wardha Scheme, in which Gandhi had made a plan for the education of elementary classes
 par tab tak hindu-muslim samudaayon ke bich daraar itani bad chuki thi ki ek duusare par ve adhiktar avishvaas hi karte the
 Nawaz's novel shows us the hallmark of this
 namvar ji 40 ke aas-paas jis hindu-muslim samasya kaa zikr kar rahe hai, uskaa thos pariprekshya mumtaj shah navaj ke upanyaas main maujuud he
 Studying Indian history closely, we see that in the early 40s, the politics of cultural purity was becoming popular in the middle class
 hindu or musalmaan samudaayon ke madhyavarg main naukariyon, bhashaa or angrejon ke pakshpaat ko lekar chali bahasein raajnneetik shakti ke rup main apane ko abhivyakt kar rahi thim
 It is around this time that Gandhi, despite giving the slogan 'quit India' in Indian politics, walks out of the stage
 bhartiya raajnneeti kaa centre congress main nehru ke ird-gird ghoomane lagata he
 This is the culmination of a whole generation of freedom movement
 ab satta main hissedari ke liye madhyavarg thik-thik saamne aa gaya
 The devaluation of ideals was being removed and the hindu-muslim problem was also expressing itself in typical modern form — that is, the question of participation in the state
 acharya hajaari prasad dvivedi ne aise main apane canan main kabir ko chunaa
 Till then Kabir was not established as a central poet on the literary scene
 iske pehle hindi main kabir par kuch chhitput kaam jarur hue the, par ye kaam kabir ko kavita ke canan main sthapit karne main sakasham na the
 We have seen that Kabir was not given a place in his Navratna by Kabir in the beginning
 kabir kaa vyaktitv or krititv aalochakon or sudhi-sahrudayon ke liye chunauti bana rahaa
 However, with the efforts of Rabindranath Tagore and Kshitimohan Sen, another identity of Kabir was being made at the same time
 apane 'hindi sahitya kaa itihaas’ ke 40 vaale sanskaran main acharya ramchandra shukla ne itnaa to mana ki prembhav or bhakthi se shunya ho rahi janata ko kabir ne maukey se sambhala or- ''iske saath hi manushyatv kii saamaanya bhaavana ko aage karke nimna shrenee kii janata main unhone aatmgaurav kaa bhav jagaaya
 
 
 But Kabir still did not join the canon
 mishrabandhuon ne bhi parvarti sanskaran main unhen jagah to di par isse bhi canan-nirmaan kii prakriya main koi bada pherbadal na hua
 Kabir joins another stream of culture for Hazari Prasad Dwivedi
 'na hindu, na musalmaan’ kaa unka ghosh 40 ke dashak main naye sire se tab praasangik hua, jab 'saanskrithik shuddhta’ ke barkhilaaf shantiniketan or vahaan se prerana lekar hajaari prasad dvivedi ne 'saanskrithik avishuddhta’ kii baat prarambh kii
 In 'ashoka's Flower' he wrote- ''
 
 
 manushya kii jivan-shakti badi nirmam he, vah sabhyataa or samskruti ke vrutha mohon ko rondti chali aa rahi he
 Do not know how many religions, beliefs, celebrations and fasts have been carried forward
 sangharshon se manushya ne nai shakti pai he
 The form of society in front of us today is such a form of eclipse and sacrifice
 desh or jati kii vishuddh samskruti keval baat kii baat he
 Everything is adulterated, everything is impure
 ’’namvar ji ne is saanskrithik khoj ko chihnit kiya he or dinakar, govind chand pandeya or agyeya aadi se iskaa algaav bhi dikhaaya he
 This is to say that Hazari Prasad Dwivedi, in the creation of culture against the cultural nationalist conception of Indian culture proposed by Savarkar and developed by Golwalkar etc
, who considers the difference between fatherland and virtuous land, which considers Muslims as second class citizens
 , Were searching for essential elements of mixedness and manhood
 par is puri saidhaantiki ko, jaisaa ki upar kaha gaya he, 40 ke vaataavaran ke gativigyaan main rakhkar dekhne kii jarurat he
 Further tracing the growing political contradictions in hindu-muslim communities, we can see that despite all the rationalistic trends of the Renaissance, there is a certain kind of tightening of the question of religion
 kuch apwaadon, masalan premchand or bhagatsingh aadi ko chhod diya jaae, to hindi kshetra main dharm ko lekar navajagaran kaa rukh viveksammat kam hi rahaa he
 Hazari Prasad Dwivedi chose a different path for himself which further expanded it without changing the defining structure of the nation
 yah vyapkikaran kii prakriya thi
 In modern times, there are many debates on the relationship of religion with the state
 dharm ko aadhunik rajasatta main dakhlandaji karne yaa uske saath ghalmail ko lagbhag sabhi aadhunik vichaarkon ne madhyakaalin mana; arthath dharm maanviya vyaktivatta kii vastu he na ki rajasatta main hastkshep kii
 It is at this point that the concept of 'secularism' can be considered as originating
 par iske aage dharmanirpekshata kii vyakhya ko lekar matvabhinnya ho jaataa he
 a section explaining secularism speaks of 'sarvadharma Sambhav'
 is sambhaav kaa taatpary he ki rajasatta sabhi dharmon ko manyata degi or un sabhi ko barabari ke bhav se dekhegi
 According to the second interpretation, 'sarvadharma Vergayate' would be true secularism in the context of the state
 kahana na hoga ki donon dhaaraon main is tarah ek buniyadi antar kii sristi ho jaati he
 In the first section, where there is a state of acceptance of religion by the state, the second section does not accept religion or is against the recognition of religion by the state
 bharat kii dharmik sanrachana ko dhyaan main rakhte hue bhartiya shaskaon ne pehali tarah kii 'dharmanirpekshata’ kaa chunaav kiya
 We can see this in Nehru's thinking and political initiatives and Dr
 ambedkar ke bhi
 He accompanied this interpretation of the Constitution's 'secularism'
 ambedkar ne bhi hindu dharm chhodkar buddha dharm apanaaya hi tha
 Needless to say that Dwivedi accepts the first interpretation of religion
 ve dharm ko bhi or vistaarit karke use uske mul arth 'dhaaran’ ke sandarbh tak le jate hai

 congress is baat ko lekar prasann he ki pradhanmantri ke ummidavaar ke rup main narendra modi kii peshbandi ne rajg main daraar paidaa kar di he or uskaa maananaa he ki gujarat ke mukhyamantri bhaajapa ke sirdard hai
 Congress general secretary Janardan Dwivedi said, Modi is a headache of BJP and NDA
 yah samprag ko prabhavit nahin karegaa
 We are not seeing him from that angle
 ham unke upwas ko is dashak ke sabase bade paakhand ke rup main dekh rahe hai
 Dwivedi, while indirectly sarcastically lashing out at senior BJP leader LK Advani, said that such people will have to beat Modi's drum, who cannot do their politics without the support of the Chief Minister of Gujarat
 yah sawaal karte hue ki aakhir modi ne kis uddeshy ke liye upwas kiya, dvivedi ne kaha ki yah ajeeb baat he ki jis vyakti ke khilaaf logon kii nyaay sambandhi shikaayatein hai usne is tarah kaa upwas kiya
 In view of contradictory signs coming from the JDU and Shiv Sena constituents of the NDA regarding the fast, he said that if the JDU and Shiv Sena are not with the fast then where is the NDA
 unhone kaha ki modi kii pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar ke taur par peshbandi ko lekar bhaajapa main sab kuch thikthak nahin he
 He asked the people in that party who had welcomed Modi's fast
 andar ve kaisaa mahasoos kar rahe hai
 He said that whether it is actually fasting or Rath Yatra, it is politics to gain control over the party
 in dinon bhaajapa main har koi apana varchasv kaayam karne ke prayaas main laga hua he
 The RSS as an organization is doing this while everyone else is doing it in their personal capacity
 agar aisi paristhitiyon main modi upwas kaa drama kar rahe hai to isamen ascharyajanak kya he
 This is just the beginning

 raksha mantri pad se istipha dekar goa ke mukhyamantri bane manohar parrikar shapath grahan samaaroh main ek chook kar baithe
 Actually, Parrikar mistakenly took the oath of the minister's post instead of the chief minister's post
 parrikar jab shapath grahan kar lautne lage to bijepi netaa nitin gadakari ne unhen is galati se avgat karaayaa
 After this Parrikar returned to the Governor again and took the oath of Chief Minister
 gauratlab he ki parrikar nechauthi baar mukhyamantri pad kii shapath lihai
 According to this, he is not new in swearing, but still he missed it
 parrikar ke saath 8 mantriyon ne bhi shapath lee
 Parrikar's cabinet consists of two BJP mlas, three from Goa Forward Party and two Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party mlas
 do nirdaleeyon ko bhi mantri banaaya gaya he
 That is, all three mlas of Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party succeeded in becoming ministers while two of three mlas of Goa Forward Party also became ministers
 donon nirdaleeyon ko mantri banane se saaf he kiperrikar ne apni sarkaarko samarthan ke badale main vidhayakon ko upakrit karne main koi kasar nahin chodi he
 He further said that as long as the command of the Congress was with Sonia Gandhi, everything was fine
 rahul gandhi ke haath main kaman aane ke baad party aage nahin bad paa rahi he
 Reacting to this news, UP Congress President Raj Babbar attacked the BJP and said that one of the motto of the party is to mobilize traitorous army
 reeta bahuguna joshi kaa sawaal he vah itihaas kii praadhyaapak rahi hai, unhen itihaas kaa gyaan he
 BJP sources said on condition of anonymity that there was a conversation between Rita and party leaders, daughter of former Chief Minister Hemvati Nandan Bahuguna
 kaha jaataa he ki vah shila dikshit ko congress kaa mukhyamantri pad kaa ummidavaar pesh karne ke congress netritv ke nirnay ko lekar aprasann hai or raaj babbar ko uttar pradesh party pramukh banaae jane ke baad vah swayan ko or adhik upekshit mahasoos kar rahi thim
 The comments unka maananaa he ki ek brahman mukhyamantri chehre ke taur par pesh karne ke liye unamem shila dikshit se adhik paatrata he
 Rita Bahuguna's brother and former Uttarakhand Chief Minister Vijay Bahuguna joined BJP a few months ago
 philhal reeta lakhanu kii kaint seat se vidhayak rahi hai
 Rita Bahuguna's joining BJP will be beneficial for the party as it will help the party unify the Brahmin vote
 congress ne brahman vot ko dekhte hue hi shila dikshit ko apana mukhyamantri pad kaa ummidavaar ghoshit kiya tha
 He believes that he deserves more than Sheila Dixit to portray him as a Brahmin chief ministerial face
 reeta bahuguna ke bhai evam uttarakhand ke purv mukhyamantri vijay bahuguna kuch maheene pehle hi bhaajapa main shaamil hue the
 Currently, Rita has been an MLA from Lucknow Cantt seat
 reeta bahuguna kaa bhaajapa main shaamil hona party ke liye laabhakaari hoga kyonki party ko brahman vot ko ekajute karne main madad milegi
 The Congress announced Sheila Dixit as its chief ministerial candidate only after seeing the Brahmin vote

 karnataka main kai din se chal rahe siyaasi drame ke baad shuukravaar ko supreme court ne bijepi ko doharaa jhatka diya he
 The Supreme Court has already asked the BJP to conduct a majority test by 4 pm on Saturday, as well as prohibiting the nomination of an anglo-indian member for the assembly
 gauratlab hi ki congress or jedy (es) ne guuruuvaar shaam ko supreme court main is bare main arji di thi ki karnataka main bijepi netaa bies yediurppa ko mukhyamantri pad ke shapathgrahan se roka jaae or kisi anglo indian samudaay ke sadsy ko emele manonith karne se bhi rajyapal ko roka jaae
 This application of Justice A

 Sikri went to the bench headed by it and it was scheduled to be heard on Friday
 yachika main kaha gaya tha kisanvidhan keanuchhed 333 ke tahat governor ko ek anglo indian sadsy ko vidhansabha kaa sadsy manonith karne kaa adhikaar he, lekin vah aisa mukhyamantri kii salaah par hi kar sakate hai, jinhen abhi bahumat pareekshan karnaa he
 In fact, the number of mlas in a majority test game matters to the BJP
 agar ek anglo-indian sadsy bijepi ke siem kii salaah par manonith hota to vah bijepi ke paksh main matdaan kar saktaa tha
 So the Congress immediately agreed to stop it
 gauratlab he ki karnataka main 222 siton par chunaav hue the, jisamen se bhaajapa ko 104, congress ko 78 or jedy-es ko 38 siten mili thim
 One of the two independent mlas had announced support for the BJP, but was seen involved in the Congress and JD-S dharna in front of Gandhi's statue in front of the Assembly on Thursday

 Mahadev Desai died of a heart attack on August 15 in the same prison
 unke nidhan par mahatma gandhi ne kaha tha ki unhone 50 saal kii jindagi main hi 100 saal kaa kaam kar diya
 Mahadev Desai is known as Mahatma Gandhi's personal secretary but he and Kasturba considered him like his son

 Cricket is definitely getting exciting, but questions are starting to arise at the level of cricket
 aisa lagane laga he, maano test match nahin, paanch din kaa van-de match ho rahaa ho
 In such a situation, any Test cricket fan is bound to worry

 bharat ke hindi pattee ilaakon main rahim ke dohe aaj bhi jeevant dekhe ja sakate hai
 Rahim was born on 17 December 1556 in Lahore to Bairam Khan, patron of Akbar
 inke dohe kii khaasiyat yah he ki yah padhe-likhe logon se lekar anpadh logon main lokapriy hai
 People still use Rahim's couplet to tell the things happening in their life
 rahim kii bhashaa ganga-jamuni tahjeeb vaali thi
 He had good knowledge of Arabic, Turkish, Persian, Sanskrit and Hindi
 rahim ne hindi ke tadbhav shabdon kaa prayog apane kavy main kiya he
 This was the reason that Akbar, happy with Rahim, gave him the title 'mirza Khan' to be given to the Shahzadas
 rahim ke granthon main rahim dohavali yaa satsai, barbai, shringaar, soratha mahatvapurn hai
 Rahim was a devotee of Lord Krishna, despite being a Muslim, he wrote many poems for Lord Krishna
 rahim ne apane kavy main pramukhataa se ramayana, mahabharat, puraana or gita ke nayakon ko jagah di
 He also translated Babur's autobiography 'tujke Babri' in Persian into Persian
 rahim ke mahatvapurn dohe1
 Kahi Rahim Sapti sage is made in many ways
 bipati kasuti je kase, tei saanche meet

 Rami stay in Chitrakoot, Rahiman Awadh Nares
 jaapar vipadaa padat he, so aavat yahi des
3
 Naat Neh distance well, which Rahim lived
 nikat niraadar hot he, jyon gadahi ko pani
4
 Look at Rahim's mind, silent silence
 ab dadur vaktaa bhae, ham ko puchhat koun
5
 Rahiman adversity is good, which happens for a few days
 hit anhith maa jagat main, jaani parat sab koy
6
 Rahim pani rahee, binu pani all sunk pani bhae na ubarain, moti maanush chun
7
 Little words beyond time, everyone's help sabha dusasana pat gahai, gada liye rahe bhim

 This is not Rahim, please love the transaction

 Gauld had to change the decision
 agali gend par stamping kii apil par tendulkar ko andeh kaa phayda mila
 The Pakistani fielders were also completely kind to Tendulkar
 tendulkar ko 27 ran par misabah ul haq, 45 ran par younis khan or 70 ran par kamran akmal ne jeevandaan diya
 On all three occasions, the unfortunate bowler was captain Shahid Afridi
 tendulkar jab 81 ran par the tab mohammad hafeez kii gend par umr akmal ne aasaan kaich tapakaaya
 Despite these lifetimes, Tendulkar could not complete his century in international cricket
 ajmal kii gend par unhone dhilaa drive khelaa or extra cover par afridi ne kaich lene main koi galati nahin kii
 Tendulkar played 115 balls and hit 11 fours
 is bich duusare chor par lagaataar teen wicket girane se tendulkar par dabaav bhi badha
 Gambhir missed the ball taking Hafeez's flight after a couple of attractive shots and the wicketkeeper completed the rest
 darshakon kaa dil tut gaya
 His beating was increased but Dhoni did not let Riyaz's hat-trick
 iske baad agali gend jab dhoni ke balle kaa kinaaraa lekar chaar ran ke liye gayi to kuch hi taaliyaan baji
 But the Indian team was under pressure and the Pakistani bowling dominated
 alam yah tha ki 30wein over ke baad gend ko seemaa rekha ke darshan karne ke liye 45wein over tak kaa intjaar karnaa padaa or is bich team ne tendulkar or dhoni ke wicket ganvaaye
 Dhoni also got life, but he could not take advantage of it
 wahaab riyaj kii gend par kamran ne unka kaich choda lekin isi over main bhartiya captain pagabaadha out ho gayi
 Dhoni also asked for a review but Simon Tafel's decision proved to be correct
 gul ne apane pehle chaar over main 41 ran diye the or baad main unki nahin chali
 In the batting powerplay, Raina targeted him and hit three fours in the 46th over
 yah powerple kaa pehla over bhi tha
 Meanwhile, 'second' rich Harbhajan Singh (12) was caught by Ajmal on 'second' while Riaz took the fifth wicket as Zaheer Khan (9)
 isse pehle ishavoltegsemifinal muqablemen captain dhoni ne toss jitkar pehle ballebaaji karne kaa nirnay liya

 nae motor whical act par raarkai rajyon ne ghatai jurmaana rashilist main bijepi rajya awwal‘ek desh ek vidhaan’ kaa naaraa dene vaali bhartiya janata party kii centre sarkaar ke liye uskaa hi ek kanoon musiibat ban gaya he
 The new Motor Vehicle Act, brought in to comply with traffic rules, significantly increased the penalty amount
 1 sitambar se lagu hue kanoon ke tahat hajaaron kii raashi ke chaalaan kate, lekin kai rajya sarkarein isse satark ho gai hai
 Many state governments have amended the law and reduced the penalty amount and the state of the Bharatiya Janata Party tops the list of these states
 kendriya parivahan mantri nitin gadakari ke is nae kanoon ke tahat jurmaana raashi 1000 se badhkar 5 hajaar yaa 10 hajaar rupee tak badha di gai
 When the new law came into force, news of invoices of up to 25 thousand and 50 thousand started coming and a heated debate started
 gujarat ne dikhaaya rastaam logon ke bich chaalaan ko lekar machi halchal ke bich rajya sarkaron ne is kanoon kaa hi ek jugad nikaal liya or is formule kii aguwai pradhanmantri narendra modi or grih mantri amit shah ke grih rajya gujarat ne kii
 The head of state, Vijay Rupani, at a press conference announced the reduction in the penalty amount and in many fines, reduced the amount to 90 percent
 chunavi chintaa main dubi bhaajapagujrat ne ek rasta dikhaaya to anya rajya bhi usapar chal die
 And in the forefront, the state where elections are going to be held in a few months
 or khaas baat ye he ki ye teenon hi rajya bhaajapa shasit pradesh hai
 After Gujarat, Maharashtra woke up and the state transport minister wrote a letter to Nitin Gadkari, raising concern over the fine amount
 devendra fadanvis kii sarkaar ko chintaa he ki kahin badi hui raashi voton kii sankhya naa gata jaae
 While Jharkhand and Haryana started on the path of Maharashtra itself, Jharkhand may soon call a special session and amend the new Motor Vehicle Act of the Center, while Haryana has said to run a 45-day conscious campaign
 ise bhi padhein: chaalaan par centre Vs rajya! ye rajya 12 din bhi nahin jhel paae road sefti par kanoonbina chunaav bhi chintaa jari haimaharashtra-jharkhand-haryana main to chunaav hai isliye jurmaana ghataane ke faisle ko raajnneetik chashme se dekha ja rahaa he lekin inase itar uttarakhand or karnataka bhi is pankti kaa hissaa ban gaye hai
 If Uttarakhand has announced the reduction of the 90 percent penalty, then it is being said that the views are being said by Karnataka right now
 in rajyon ke alaava bhi kai bijepi shasit rajya aise hai, jahaan nae kanoon kaa notification jari nahin kiya gaya he
 For example, the new Motor Vehicle Act has not yet been implemented in the country's largest state Uttar Pradesh
 sirf bijepi rajya hi nahin balki kai vipakshi partiyon ke rajyon ne bhi is kanoon ko lagu nahin kiya he
 So far, these states have reduced the amount of penalty: Gujarat, Maharashtra, Jharkhand (idea), Uttarakhand, Haryana (awareness campaign), Karnataka (idea), Uttar Pradesh (not yet implemented), West Bengal (protest), said, Nitin Gadkari? Let's bring the formula to the fore
 gadakari sadak banane main nai takanic laate hai, license banane ke liye nae formule laate hai or ab trephic niyamon kaa paalan karne ke liye gadakari nayaa kanoon laae to akele padate najar aa rahe hai
 However, Nitin Gadkari has said that the state government can use its authority to manipulate the law

 lekin abhi tak yah bill transport, tourism or culture kii parliamentry standing kamity ke paas rivyuu ke liye pending padaa hua he
 Road Transport and National Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari called it a historic step towards making roads safer and saving lives of millions of innocent people
 yah sthati tab he, jab modi sarkaar ke ek varisht netaa or mantri kii sadak durghatana main hi maut hui thi
 Gopinath Munde, popular backward class BJP leader from Maharashtra, was going to Indira Gandhi Airport in Delhi on June 3, 2014 when his car collided with another vehicle near Prithviraj road-tulagak Road roundabout

 Provision has been made
 kuch pramukh prastaav is prakaar hai-- sharaab pikar gaadi chalaane par 10 hajaar rupee tak kaa jurmaana or ‘hit and ran’ maamalon ke liye do lakh rupee kaa muaavja

 The total length of roads in the country is 52 lakh kilometers, but the national highway has a burden of 40 percent of the total traffic of the country, while the national highway is just 2 percent of the total roads of the country
 isi kii vajah se sadak durghatnaon ke aankade lambey hote ja rahe hai
 What did the government do on road safety? According to Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari, the ministry has tried to identify black spots to prevent road accidents on highways with the help of common people
 rajmargon par blike spots wo jagah kehalaate hai, jahaan par adhiktar durghatnaayen hoti hai
 After a detailed investigation, the government has identified 726 black spots on the routes across the country
 gadakari ke anusaar, in jagahon ko banane or sudhaarney ke liye kaam puri teji se chal rahaa he
 It is now being seen as a continuous process
 nae blike spots kii pahchaan kii jaati he or usamen sudhaar kiya jaataa he
 The death rate of people in road accidents is also high because the person injured in a road accident takes a long time to get proper accidental treatment
 is maamle se nipatane ke liye supreme court ke nirdeshaanusaar sarkaar ne ek vishesh guideline tay kii he jiske anusaar ghayalon ko aspataal pahunchane vaale bhale logon se aspataal, police yaa anya agenciyon kii taraf se koi poochtacha yaa uskaa kisi bhi tarah se utpeedan nahin kiya jayega
 Apart from these, the ministry is also trying to implement intelligent traffic system
 is system ko lagu karne se trephic kanoon todane waalon ko real time main trek karke pakadaa ja sakegaa
 An important initiative is also being taken by the Ministry regarding bridges
 sarkaar ne indian brij management systams (ibmes) kii sthapana kii he
 In this system, there will be a real time record of the bridges present in the entire country

 The government has also set a fixed guideline regarding speed breakers
