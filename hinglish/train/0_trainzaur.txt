 lagata he patliputra seat argedy supremeo lalu prasad yadav ke liye pratishtha kaa sawaal ban gaya he
 How important is the victory of his daughter Misa Bharti for Lalu Yadav on this seat, it can be gauged from the fact that Lalu Yadav reached the house of a man who has not only been in jail for the past several years but whose Identification has been a very dangerous criminal
 patliputra se misa bharti ke khilaaf jaise hi jail me band reetlal yadav ne apane ummidavaari kaa elaan kiya, lalu yadav apane laav-lashkar ke uske ghar ja dhamke
 For about 45 minutes, he prayed in a closed room with Reetlal's father and brother
 lalu chaahate the ki reetlal misa ke khilaaf chunaav naa lade
 Coming out of the room, he put a garland around the neck of the father whose son's name used to tremble in the Danapur area
 ye lalu yadav kii raajnneetik majaburi hi thi jo unhen us reetlal yadav ke daravaaje tak khinch laai jo kabhi patna or danapur kaa aatank kaha jaataa tha, jiske daaman par aaj bhi kai begunaahon ke katl ke daag hai, to kai masuumon ke apharan or phiroti ke liye wo aaj bhi jail main salaakhon ke peeche he
 There was a time when he was involved in the most wanted list of Patna Police and the police was looking for him dead or alive
 lekin aaj lalu yadav uski choukhat par apni sheesh nava aae
 The reason was that if Ritlal Yadav stood up in the elections, then the Yadav votes received by his daughter Misa Bharti will be breached and then this battle will become very difficult
 lalu ne reetlal yadav ke pita se mulaakaat khatm hone ke baad kaha ki ye hamaare puraane log hai, inase purana rishta he, inase baat hui he, ye yahaan kii raajnneeti tay karenge , jo hoga inke mutabik hoga
 In fact, after Ramkripal Yadav hit the ground, the battle of Misa Bharti has become very difficult
 aise main lalu apane vot me ratti bhar send bhi bardaasht nahin kar sakate
 Ritlal Yadav was a name that was not ready to listen to Lalu Yadav and he had announced to contest the election
 aise main lalu yadav ne beti kii is ladaai ke liye usulon ko taak par rakhaa or chal die us reetlal yadav ke ghar
 Lalu has called him innocent even at Reetlal's house, but even after the meetings, Reetlal's family has not said openly that he will not contest the election
 ilaake main or khaskar yadav matadaataaon par reetlal yadav kii acchhee pakad maani jaati he or pichhali vidhaan sabha chunaav main usne nirdaleey 50 hajaar se zyada vot batore the, jisase argedy apane garh main buree tarah haar gai thi, is baar bhi usne 27 taarikh ko apana parchaa bharne kaa elaan kar rakhaa tha
 In such a situation, Lalu Yadav was also in a hurry to manage him
 reetlal yadav maane yaa naa maane par lalu yadav aaj ek badi ladai haar gaye
 One thing became clear that now Lalu Yadav no longer has the same influence on the voters of his caste who once used to be his only
 saaf ho gaya ab raajnneetik rup se lalu se bade unki birdari ke netaa or apradhi ho chuke hai

 Transport expert Sudhir Badami says that such cracks are not right, it should be investigated
 bagaiyr jaanch ke kaha nahin ja saktaa ki daraaren upree hai yaa andruni
 The comments MMRDA diarector kaa kahana he ki ye daraaren phinishing kii vajah se hai
 All the pillars are fully fortified from the inside and work is being done on the basis of CRRI (central Road Research Institute) report
 2015 kii CAG report bhi in khaamiyon kii pushti karti he
 According to the CAG, the age of every civil structure should be 120 years, but it was ignored in the monorail and MMRDA did not take any action against the construction agencies

 It cannot be said without examination whether the cracks are overhead or internal

 The 2015 CAG report also confirms these flaws
 CAG ke mutabik har civil strecchar kii umr 120 saal honi chahie, lekin monorol main isaki andekhi hui or MMRDA ne construction agenciyon ke khilaaf koi kadam nahin uthaaya
 Anil Galgali, a complainant, says that he had earlier also complained to MMRDA, but no concrete steps were taken, just upstream repairs

 Moily's statement comes a day after Dhanoa's comment that he said Rafale is a game-changer aircraft and the Supreme Court has given a very good judgment on the deal
 vayusena pramukh ke is bayaan par moili kii is tippanee se vivaad khadaa ho gaya he
 Significantly, the Supreme Court in its order had dismissed all the petitions related to the investigation of the Rafale deal under the supervision of the court
 jodhpur main media ko sambodhit karte hue buudhvaar ko vayusena pramukh ne rafel ladaaku vimaan ko game changer bataaya tha
 He also said that he would not comment on the decision of the court, but the Supreme Court has given a very good decision
 kyonki hamen is vimaan kii bahut jarurat thi
 On Thursday, former Union Minister Veerappa Moily said that against the government record, the Ministry of Defense and the Chief of the Air Force wanted Hindustan Aeronautical Limited (HAL) to be included in the deal
 unhone kaha ki us samay vayusena pramukh dasolt ke pratinidhiyon ke saath hindustan aironotical limited gaye the or unhone paaya tha ki HAL vimaan banane main sakasham or visheshgy he
 i believe the Air Force Chief is not well, they are lying, they are suppressing the truth

 sarkaar ke is faisle ko rajya ke purv mukhyamantri or congress ke varisht netaa siddharmaiya ne galat qaraar diya he
 He has said that the decision to ban Tipu Sultan's birth anniversary through the BJP government of Karnataka is wrong and it is a big mistake
 The decision to discontinue Tipu Jayanthi by@bjp4karnatakais wrong & a big mistake
 Tipu was not recognized just because he is from minority community but because of his contribution as a ruler
 He fought bravely against British & initiated many development works
 Through a tweet @ inckarnataka — Siddaramaiah (@siddaramaiah) July 30, 2019, Siddaramaiah said that Tipu was not identified simply because he was from a minority community but also as a ruler
 unhone angrejon ke khilaaf bahaduree se ladaai ladi or kai vikaas kaaryon kii shuruyaat kii thi
 On the other hand, Karnataka Congress has shared a picture of the Chief Minister of the state Yeddyurappa

 On one hand, while the Delhiites have got some relief from the heat due to the rains for two days, on the other hand, this rain has made 'ravan' devastated
 vijay dashami yani dashahra bas kuch hi din dur he aise main ravan ko sajaane kii taiyaariyaan zoron par hai
 But the surprising thing is that there are no special arrangements to save Ravana from this unseasonal rain
 rajdhani dilli ke west dilli ilaake main har saal kii tarah is saal bhi raunak he or vajah he rang birange, har dizine ke ravan
 These days, within 2 km radius from Rajouri Garden to Tilak Nagar, Ravana is attracting the attention of people passing by
 lekin jis khubsuurati auki mehnat se ravan ko sajaayaa ja rahaa he barish se bachaane ke liye yahaan par koi vishesh intazaam nahin he
 According to the Meteorological Department, even in the coming days of the week, the capital Delhi is going to have wet weather, in such a situation, Ravan kept on the road is in bad condition
 sadak par rakhe ravan, kumbhakarna or meghnath ke ye putale abhi aadhe hi taiyaar hue hai
 The damage caused by rain water to mannequins made of cloth, glass paper, bass and glue can be estimated
 ravan ke putalon par kaam kar rahe ek kalakaar ne bataaya- 'iff putalon ko ham sadak par hi rakhte hai, aadhe putale metro ke neeche rakhaa gaya he, barish se bachaane kaa koi intazaam nahin he aise main bahut tej barish se kaaphi nuksaan ho saktaa he'
 An artist, who is painting different colors in Ravana, said- 'it is enamel paint which does not leave water, but the color of the paper and the color of the cloth used in it will surely fade from the rain water'
 logon ko dashahara kaa besabri se intazaar he, haalanki dashahara main abhi thodaa vakt he agar aane vaale dinon main bhi agar dilli main barish hoti he to bhiige hue ravan ko sukhaane ke liye kalakaaron ko kaaphi dikkaton kaa saaman karnaa pad saktaa he
 And if this happens, there will be a lot of difference in the effigy business, which is sure to damage the artists of the effigy market

 lekin jab unase ye poocha gaya ki aakhir pichley paanch saalon main kitne ghotalebaz logon ko dabl ingine kii sarkaar ne sazaa dilaai to unhone us par kuch bhi saafe-saafe nahin kaha
 However, he claims that the number of officers who took action in corruption cases during his reign had not happened before

 There is no doubt that concepts about corruption and inflation influenced the election results
 isliye sawaal paidaa hota he ki vikaas or shashan pranali chunavi kismat ko kis had tak prabhavit karte hai? is bare main aankade adhure hai
 While there is some evidence of good governance and punishing bad governance, it has to be clearly explained what the governance system ultimately means
 iskaa taalluk is baat se he ki naagarik kisi rajya sarkaar se kya ummiden rakhte hai
 Expectations are the boxes in which a citizen feels that he should get a favorable environment, good law and order situation, solid infrastructure facilities (electricity, roads and water) are available, social infrastructure should be maintained and corruption is reduced
 lekin inamen se kuch chijen rajya sarkaron ke daayre se baahar hai, jisase gananaaen ulat-pulat ho jaati hai
 Assembly elections have been held recently in Assam, West Bengal, Kavral, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry
 in paanch rajyon ke har vidhansabha kshetra main partiyon ke kaamkaaj ko lekar aankade uplabdh hai
 Some special data can be prepared about socio-economic indicators with some variations at the level of assembly constituencies
 is tarah hamen 2006 or 2011 ke bich saamaajik-aarthik suchakon main sudhaar (yaa unke bigadane) ke bare main jaankaree he or ham yah bhi jaanate hai ki 2006 or 2011 ke bich partiyon ko mili voton main kitna antar aayaa
 Is there a relationship between them? It is necessary to state here that this question is being asked at the constituency level and not at the state level
 nateezon se pataa chalata he ki agar koi is tarah se nirvachan kshetra or usase neeche ke str par dekhe, to isamen ve suchak sabase zyada myne rakhte hai jinka parivaar kii aarthik uplabdhiyon-prati vyakti aay or sadak sampark-se gaharaa or sidhaa sambandh he
 Socio-economic criteria, such as infant mortality, vaccination, and variable education-related factors, do not matter
 shaayad isliye nahin ki ve mahatvapurn nahin hai, balki isliye ki matadaata jaanata he ki inke bare main faisla centre sarkaar kii yojanaon ke antargat kiya jaataa he
 Even on the whole, crime does not matter, but violent crime, economic crimes and crimes related to social unrest have an impact on elections
 kya iskaa matlab yah he ki anya saamaajik-aarthik suchakon kaa chunaav nateezon par koi asar nahin padataa he? koi khaas nahin
 The same thing was observed in sample surveys of Assam, West Bengal, Kavral, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry
 in paanch rajyon main anya saamaajik-aarthik suchakon main sudhaar hone kaa matdaan ke tareeke par koi vishesh sankhyikeey asar nahin padaa

 Input: IANS kendriya paryaavaran mantralay ne shuukravaar ko mumbai kii adarsh koaparative sosayadi kii 31 manjila vivaadit imaarat ko puri tarah gaiyrkanoonee bataate hue sosayadi ko kaaran bataao notice jari kiya or do hafton main jawaab dene ko kaha he
 Adarsh cooperative Housing Society has been served a notice under the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) Notification 1991 for violation of rules
 kendriya paryaavaran mantri jairam ramesh ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘yah sabit hua he ki adarsh kooparative houseing sosayadi kii 31 manjila imaarat ke nirmaan main siarjed niyamon kaa gambhir taur par ulanghan hua he or puri imaarat gaiyrkanoonee he
 Therefore, the society has been issued a show cause notice asking why this unauthorized structure should not be demolished
 ’ramesh ne bataaya ki mantralay ne paryaavaran (sangrakshan) adhinium, 1986 kii dhara 5 ke tahat kaaran bataao notice jari kiya he or unhen likhit jawaab dene ke liye do saptaah kaa samay diya he
 He said that apart from this, the management of the society will be given a week's time to meet our officials
 mantri ke anusaar iske baad mantralay aage kii karrwai par faisla karegaa
 Ramesh said, 'it is clear that Adarsh (society) has not taken any permission from the Government of Maharashtra or from the Central Government to build the building
 isliye puri imaarat gaiyrkanoonee he
 He indicated that this land belongs to the state government or to the Defense Department, his ministry has nothing to do with it
 ramesh ne kaha, ‘hamaare liye yah myne nahin rakhata ki jameen kiski he
 Ours (of the Ministry of Environment) is limited to whether it violates the rules under the CRZ
 ’unhone kaha ki guuruuvaar ko dilli main maharashtra sarkaar ke adhikariyon or kendriya paryaavaran mantralay ke adhikariyon kii vistaar purvak hui baithak main yah nishkarsh saamne aayaa ki puraa dhaancha gaiyrkanoonee he or isamen siarjed niyamon kaa gambhir ulanghan hua he
 Ramesh said that in connection with this, the Maharashtra government had also given a show cause notice to the society in November 2009
 haalanki is notice ke jawaab or us par sarkaar kii taraf se karrwai ke bare main paryaavaran mantralay ke adhikariyon ne koi spasht uttar nahin diya
 There was no clear response from the environment minister to reporters' questions about whether there is any possibility of the building being completely demolished, although he said, "let the notice be answered
" pehla kadam uthaaya gaya he
 All options are open to us except regulation
 ’mantralay ke adhikariyon ne ek sawaal ke jawaab main kaha ki jis kshetra main adarsh sosayadi kii 31 manjila imaarat banaai gayi he, vahaan adhiktam nau manjilon ke nirmaan kii anumati mil sakati he
 Ramesh said, "let me make it clear that if construction was allowed in that area, a maximum of nine floors would have been approved
 ’is par jab samvaadadaataaon ne poocha ki kya imaarat kii 22 manjilon ko giraakar shesh bachi nau ke niyaman ke bare main sarkaar koi vichaar kar sakati he, to unhone kaha ki is bare main abhi kuch nahin kaha ja saktaa

 ' aaj hi kaa wo din he jab bharat ko angrejon kii gulaami se aazaadee mili thi

 Know why Pakistan started celebrating Independence Day on 14 instead of August 15, Pakistan is celebrating its 71st Independence Day today
 is din sabhi vidyalayon, sarkari karyaalayon par rashtriya dhvaj fahraaya jaataa he, raashtragit gaaya jaataa he or in sabhi mahapurushon, shaheedon ko shradhanjali di jaati he
 The Prime Minister of India hoists the national flag at Lalkil in the capital Delhi and addresses the nation
 71wein swatantraaa diwas par is baar desh ke 14wein pradhanmantri narendra modi ne rashtriya dhvaj fahraaya
 It is known that some stories related to independence, the speech made by India's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru in the midnight of 14 August 1947, is known as 'trust with Destiny'

 The Honorable Prime Minister hoists the flag from the Red Fort on every Independence Day, but this did not happen in 1947
 desh ke pehle pradhanmantri jawahar laal nehru ne 16 agast ko laal kile se jhanda fahraaya
 The reason for this was that the tricolor as the national flag of independent India was first hoisted at 10:30 pm on August 15, 1947 at the Council House (parliament House)
 kyonki 15 agast ko nehru ji or anya netaa raaj-kaaj ke kaamon main vyast the
 Due to busyness, Jawaharlal Nehru first started on August 16 at 8 am on the Red Fort

 Mahatma Gandhi was not involved in the celebration of independence, see RARE PHOTOS India and Pakistan got the midnight of Independence 15 but despite being free one day, Pakistan celebrates independence on 14 August
 pakistan ke sansthaapak mohammad ali jinnah ne pehle swatantraaa diwas par apane sandesh main 15 agast ko hi pakistan kaa bhi azaadi diwas kaha tha
 But after this, Pakistan started celebrating its Independence Day a day before on 14 August
 vahiin tab se jinnah kaa swatantraaa diwas sandesh bhi 14 agast ko hi sunaaya jaataa he
 Although both countries celebrate independence on the same day, but according to the Indian Independence Act, India and Pakistan were liberated on the same day
 15 agast tak bharat or pakistan ke bich seemaa rekha kaa nirdhaaran nahin hua tha
 This was decided with the announcement of the Radcliffe Line on 17 August

 china khoonkhaar aatanki sanghathan jaish-e-mohammad ke sargana masood ajahar ke mudde par to maan gaya, lekin parmaanu aapurtikarta samooh (NSG) main bharat ko shaamil kiye jane par uskaa adnga jari he
 On Friday, China said there would be no discussion of including India in the NSG until a plan was reached on countries that had not signed the Nuclear non-proliferation Treaty (NPT)
 jab china ke videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa lu kong se poocha gaya ki yah sahmati kab tak ban paaegi, to unhone samay seemaa bataane se inkaar kar diya
 He said that this issue needs to be discussed in detail
 lihaaja wo isko lekar koi bhavishyavaanee nahin kar sakate hai
 When China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Kang was asked if there was a change in China's attitude towards India's inclusion in the NSG
 iske jawaab main unhone kaha ki kazakhtan ke astana main chal rahi enesji kii baithak main bharat ko lekar koi charchaa nahin hui he
 Until a plan is agreed on the countries that have not signed the Nuclear non-proliferation Treaty, there will be no discussion on the inclusion of other countries in the NSG
 is dauraan china ke videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa kong ne kaha ki china bharat ke enesji main pravesh par adnga nahin laga rahaa he
 China is only talking about following NSG rules and procedures
 unhone kaha, 'china bharat hi nahin, balki kisi bhi desh ke enesji main shaamil kiye jane par adnga nahin laga rahaa he
 The NSG has procedures and rules, according to which the member countries decide
 mujhako lagata he ki astana main enesji kii baithak chal rahi he or isamen gaiyr parmaanu aprasar sandhi vaale deshon, raajnneetik or kanoonee muddon par charchaa hogi
 When the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman was told that most of the members of the NSG are supporting the inclusion of India, while China has been steadfastly obstructing, he said, "it cannot be said that China will be able to support India in the NSG
" Is obstructing the entry of haalanki main nishchit rup se yah kahuunga ki enesji ek bahupaksheeya gaiyr parmaanu aprasar maikenism he, jiske apane niyam or prakriya hai
 All member states should follow NSG rules and procedures
 saath hi koi bhi faisla aam sahmati se liya janaa chahie
 'let me tell you that 48 countries including China are members of NSG
 yah samooh vaishvik str par asainya kaaryon ke liye parmaanu saamagree or takanic ke aadan-pradaan ko sunishchit karata he
 The NSG was formed in 1974 to protest nuclear tests conducted by India 
 bharat ne may 2016 main enesji kii sadsyta ke liye aavedan kiya tha, jiskaa china shuru se hi virodh kar rahaa he
 Along with India, Pakistan has also applied for membership of NSG
 china kaa kahana he ki enesji main sirf unheen deshon ko shaamil kiya jayega, jin deshon ne parmaanu aprasar sandhi (enpiti) main hastakshar kiya he
 India has no longer signed the non-proliferation Treaty
 isse pehle aatanki sanghathan jaish-e-mohammad ke sargana masood ajahar ko vaishvik aatanki ghoshit karaane ke bharat ke prayaas par china lambey samay tak adnga lagaataa rahaa, lekin ant main harkar use haal hi main apane adnge ko waapas lenaa padaa tha
 After this, the UN Security Council declared Masood Azhar a global terrorist
 isko bharat kii badi kamyaabi mana gaya, jabaki pakistan kii vifaltaa maani gai

 unhone kaha ki pi chidambaram varisht netaa he or desh ke vittamantri va grahamantri rah chuke hai
 He said that everyone should remember that there are four pillars in our country, which include democratic institutions, Election Commission, media and judiciary
 ham apane desh main loktantr ko khote ja rahe hai
 However, Mamata Banerjee refused to react to the case filed against p Chidambaram
 mamata banerjee ne rabindranath tagore kaa hawala dete hue kaha ki nyaay kaa sandesh ekant main sisakiyaan le rahaa he
 Meanwhile, Mamta Banerjee also targeted the media

 tushaar mehta ne kaha ki INX media ne galat tareeke se FDI vasuul kii he, jo FIPB ke niyamon kaa ulanghan he
 INX Media benefited unfairly because of Chidambaram, after which the company has also given money to other companies

 bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah ne congress pramukh sonia gandhi dwaara pradhanmantri narendra modi par nishaanaa saadhe jane ke baad un par palatwaar karte hue ravivaar ko kaha ki sonia kii 'ankhon par pattee padi' he or vah un garibon kii cheekh sun or dekh nahin paa raheen jinhen haryana kii congress sarkaar ne pareshaan kiya he
 During an election rally in Sonepat district of Haryana, Shah said, 'I don't know what your (sonia) understanding is
 par kya aap is baat se inkaar kar sakati hai ki haryana main mahilaon par atyaachaar hua he or ve ro rahi hai? kya yah sach nahin he ki kisaanon kii jaminen chin lee gayi or ve ro rahe hai?' The BJP leader said, 'youth is also crying because it is not getting employment opportunities
 kya yah sach nahin he? soniyaji, main jaanata hum ki aap sach nahin dekh saktin kyonki aapaki ankhon par pattee padi he
 ' sonia ke kal ke bayaan par palatwaar karte hue shah ne kaha ki jo log jor se chillaate hai ve galatabayani karne ke bajaay apane aakrosh ko baahar nikaalane kaa majboot tarika sujhaate hai
 Shah said, 'you (sonia) cannot understand this pain because you do not go to the villages
 aap garib ke yahaan nahin paidaa huin
 You do not go to dalits
 hamaare pradhanmantri garib ke bete hai
 He has reached this stage by selling tea and understands the sufferings of the poor of the villages
 soniyaji, yadi aapako yah sab galat lagata he to phir aapako or aapaki party ko bhagwaan hi bachaae
 ' sonia gandhi ne haryana main ek jansabha ke dauraan kaha tha ki pradhanmantri narendra modi is tarah 'dikhaava' kar rahe hai jaise sara kaam unki sarkaar ke satta main aane ke baad hi hua he
 On this, Shah retorted that the wrong things Congress has done in the last 60 years are difficult to compensate
 shah ne kaha ki bhaajapa ne desh ko ek aisa pradhanmantri diya he jo bolte hai
 He said that in the first 100 days of the previous Congress-led UPA government and the bjp-led NDA government, the difference is that earlier Pakistan used to start firing from across the border and end it, but now it started from Pakistan India pacifies the firing
 shah ne kaha, 'pakistan ab kisi bhartiya sainik kaa sir kalam karne kaa saahas nahin kar saktaa
 The Modi government has made this difference in its first 100 days
 ' kendriya mantri evam bhaajapa netaa ravishankar prasad ne bhi modi ke khilaaf tippanee karne ko lekar sonia ko aade haath liya
 Prasad said, 'I am sorry to say that despite being out of power, the people writing Soniaji's speeches do not do their homework
 is vajah se vah kabhi-kabhaar aisi baaten kah jaati hai
 They will realize their mistakes by looking in the mirror
 ' unhone daawa kiya ki upie sarkaar kii aguwai karne ke liye congress ne jahaan ek kamjor pradhanmantri diya tha, vahiin bhaajapa ne kendriya cabinet kii aguwai ke liye ek majboot shaks ko aage kiya he
 Shah asked Sonia whether any Prime Minister was welcomed in America in the same way as Modi
 unhone kaha, 'pradhanmantri narendra modi ne jab sanyukt raashtra mahasabha ko hindi main sambodhit kiya to 125 karod bharatiyon ko garv mahasoos hua
 Targeting the Congress, Shah said that the previous Prime Minister used to address the country from behind the bullet proof cover from the ramparts of the Red Fort

 This has been mainly in view of increasing demand for ciders from importers and some banks and softening in domestic market
 kaarobaariyon ne kaha ki kuch videshi mudra ke mukaable dollar kii teji ke alaava satat puunji pravaah se rupee par asar padaa
 On Friday, the rupee was down 17 paise to 66 rupees due to pressure on the rupee due to fresh demand for importers' dollars and strong prospects of rising interest rates in the US

 6, which is disappointing
 Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has expressed concern over the deteriorating economy of the country
 unhone kaha ki arthvyavastha kii sthiti aaj bahut chintajanak he
 Reaching five per cent of GDP is a sign that we are caught in the vortex of a long recession
 bharat kii arthvyavastha main teji se aage badhane kii kshamta he, lekin modi sarkaar ke kuprabandhan ne desh kii arthvyavastha ko mandi main dhakel diya he
 Manmohan Singh said that the economy has not yet recovered from human mismanagement like demonetisation and GST
 bhartiya janata party ne unke is daawey kaa jawaab dete hue kaha he ki wo unki sarkaar kii galatiyon ko hi sudhaar rahe hai
 The Indian economy is reeling under recession these days
 pichhali timahi main bharat kii vikaas dar 5 pratishat rahi thi
 Which shows that India is stuck in recession
 sabase hairaani ki baat he ki menuphaccharing sector kii growth sirf 0

 Nominal GDP has reached the lowest level of 15 years
 kar rajasav main baari kami he
 Manmohan Singh said, there is huge apathy among investors
 yah aarthik sudhaar kii neenv nahin he
 Our economy has not recovered from the man made blunders of demonetisation & a hastily implemented GST

 com / 83cbjwhay9— Congress (@incindia)september 1, 2019naukariyon ke avasar paidaa na hone par bhi manmohan singh ne modi sarkaar ko jamkar gheraa
 He said that 3 in the automobile sector
 5 lakh naukariyaan ja chuki hai
 Similarly, in the unorganized sector, people are losing jobs on a large scale
 unhone kaha ki gramin bharat kii sthiti or dayaneey he
 Farmers are not getting the right price and rural income has fallen
 unhone kaha ki jis kam mahangaai dar ko modi sarkaar dikhaa rahi he, uski keemat hamaare kisaan or unki aay he
 He said that institutions are in danger and their autonomy is being trampled
 sarkaar ne arabiai se 1
 76 lakh crores, but he has no plans what will happen with this money
 unhone kaha ki is sarkaar main bhartiya data kii vishwasaneeyata sawaalon ke ghere main aa gai he
 Budget announcements were withdrawn, shaking the confidence of international investors
 unhone kaha ki bhu-raajnneetik badlaav ke kaaran vaishvik vyapaar main paidaa hue maukon kaa laabh lene main bharat naakaam rahaa or vah apana niryaat tak badha nahin paaya
 This is the condition of economic management in Modi government
 loksabhaa chunaav kaa samay jaise-jaise najadik aa rahaa he, vaise-vaise sabhi raajnneetik dalon main apane-apane ilaakon ke keel-kaante ko durust karne kii bechaini badhati ja rahi he
 Priyanka Vadra, daughter of Congress President Sonia Gandhi and sister of Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi, has indicated to take command of the mother and brother's parliamentary seat in their hands, so that both of them become independent during the general election and visit other parts of the country
 Can do
 sonia kii sansadeey seat raibareli or rahul kii loksabhaa seat amethi main santhnik dhaanche ko durust karne ke liye priyanka wadra ne in donon kshetron main apni sakriyata badha di he
 It was also seen during Rahul and Priyanka's last Amethi tour
 priyanka ab tak apni maa sonia kii hi seat par homework karti rahi hai, lekin ab donon sansadeey siton kii kaman sidhe unke hi haathon main hogi
 Party strategists also feel that after the way in which the party had to face opposition in Rae Bareli and Amethi in the recently concluded assembly elections, Priyanka has decided to take control of both these seats
 raibareli or amethi se jude ek sthaneey varisht patrkaar ramesh gautam ne bataaya ki 2009 main hue loksabhaa chunaav or ab ke halaat main bhi kaaphi antar aa chukaa he
 At that time Congress was in the possession of 6 out of 10 assembly seats of Rae Bareli and Amethi, but this time the number has come down to two
 gandhi parivaar ke liye yah khatre kii ghanti kii tarah hi he
 He said that due to tremendous infighting within the party in both the seats in the assembly elections, the party suffered
 isse naaraaz hokar hi priyanka ne donon siton kii kaman apane haathon main lene kaa man banaaya he
 Another interesting thing is that Madhusudan Mistry, the Congress in-charge of Uttar Pradesh affairs and state president Nirmal Khatri have already announced that the Congress will field its candidates in Etawah and Mainpuri, while the SP chief has given the sp's candidature in Rae Bareli and Amethi
 Haven't opened your cards
 is lihaaj se yadi in donon siton par sapa ne apane pratyaashee khadey kiye, to donon siton par muqabla bada hi rochak banegaa
 When asked about Priyanka's role in Rae Bareli and Amethi, Congress state spokesperson Zeeshan Haider said, "rae Bareli and Amethi have been the traditional seats of the Gandhi family and it is for the same family to decide how much will be there
 ’haidar ne kaha ki itnaa jarur he ki priyanka gandhi ab tak zyada samay raibareli ko hi detii ain hai, lekin is baar focus donon siton par rahegaa or unheen ke maargdarshan main pehle bhi chunaav ladaa gaya tha or abhi bhi ladaa jayega

 shivasena ne apane mukhpatr 'saamana' ke sampadakeey main mangalvaar ko aam aadmi party or congress par tikhe hamale kiye
 In the article, both the parties have been ridiculed by advising the readers to do the Arad Shraddha and the sacrifice of Congress
 sampadakeey main kaha gaya he ki aam aadmi party do guton main banty he or anna se alag hone kaa khamiyaja bhugat rahi he

 'lekh main aage likhaa gaya he ki anna hajaare ne arvind kejariwal ko kai baar samajhaayaa ki raajnneeti keechad he ise deh par mat malo, keechad main mat utaro
 But Kejriwal had turned the talk by saying that he was venturing into mud to clean the mud
 lekin dilli main sarkaar girane or pole-pattee khul jane ke baad keechad main utarane or uski safai karne kaa sara dhong sabake saamne aa gaya he or jo chunavi haddi kejariwal ne phenki thi wo ab unke hi gale main ataki hui he

 isse saaf ho gaya ki kejariwal kaa janalokapal kaa vichaar bhi dhilaa hi tha
 And finally
 
 
 sampadiya ke ant main likhaa gaya he, 'sirf dusron par jehar ugalane se kuch siddh nahin hota
 In politics, it is the turn to 'show the father or else do shraddh'

 Yes, the deity or idol can be a legal person ie a juristic person, but cannot fight a case

 Because Valmiki himself wrote it with poetic and imagination

 Kejriwal used to continuously speak against Chidambaram and today he became his friend? Sandeep Dixit has called Kejriwal as an opportunity

 In which Kejriwal made many serious allegations against Chidambaram

 All Muslims are engaged in persuading Allah with prayers

 By this, the body gets more and more nutrients
 ramajaan main lambey samay tak bhukhe rahane ke baad der shaam khaane se sharir main Adiponectin hormone banataa he, ye sharir ko zyada nutrients ebjorb karne main madad karata he
 5- Get rid of bad habits - Ramadan is the best time to get rid of bad habits

 According to the UK National Health Service, Ramadan is the best time to overcome smoking, alcohol and tobacco addiction

 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he) Swine flu havoc has spread in many countries of the world and before this disease reaches India, it is very important to take precaution
 bharat sarkaar is beemaari se prabhavit deshon main jane waalon ke liye adwijuri jari karne vaali he or ek toll free number bhi jari kiya he
 Most people are seen wearing surgical masks on the streets of Mexico
 ye khauf he swine flu kaa jisane abhi tak 1614 logon ko chapet main le liya he, jinamein se 103 maut ke munh main samaa chuke hai
 This flu has caused panic in the Rashtrapati Bhavan of America
 america raashtrapati baraak obama ne kaha ki ham swine flu ko lekar kaaphi gambhir hai or ise rokane ke sabhi jaruri kadam uthaae ja rahe hai
 But before these dangerous deadly diseases reach India, the government affected countries New Zealand
 spain, france, yues jane waalon ke liye adwijuri jari karne kaa faisla kiya he or janata ko jaankaree dene ke liye 1075 toll free number jari kiya he
 Apart from this, the Health Department has asked the countries affected by swine flu to investigate those returning in 10 days
 spinal flu se pehali maut southern oksaka state main hui thi
 But by the time the patient's sample was sent
 tab tak is marz ne aspataal ke kai staff ko apni chapet main le liya
 The special thing is that children and old people are usually the victims of the flu
 lekin swine flu ke shikaar 20 se 40 saal kii umr ke bich ke log hai
 Aaj Tak bureau with Delhi apni aarthik sthiti sudhaarney ke liye bhartiya railway LPG kii tarj par apane yatriyon ko sabsidi chhodane kaa vikalp dene ja rahaa he
 For this, the Ministry of Railways has approved a separate column in the ticket booking form 
 is kollam main yah poocha jayega ki aap rail tikat par sabsidi lenaa chaahate hai yaa nahin
 Those who would like to get subsidy on this will get railway tickets at the subsidized rate and those who do not want to take subsidy will get tickets at full rate
 is tareeke kii vyavastha rail tikat kii online booking ke liye iarsitisi kii website par bhi di jaaegi
 According to Railway Ministry sources, the option of taking or not taking subsidy will be started from next month
 milti he 43 fisadi kii sabsididrasal railway ko paisanger kiraye main ghaataa hota he or is par takreeban 43 fisadi sabsidi di jaati he
 This simply means that the railway earns only 57 rupees at the expense of hundred rupees on any ticket
 is vajah se railway par lagaataar aarthik dabaav bana rahata he
 Railways are constantly trying to get rid of it, but in the midst of all this a recent incident happened that the Railways got a new idea
 aise mila idiahua yun ki faridabad ke avatar krishna kher ne iarsitisi kii website ke jariye apnarel tikatbook karaayaa tha, jab unhone rail tikat kaa print liya to usamen neeche likhaa hua tha ki kya aap jaanate hai ki aapke kiraye kaa 43 fisadi desh ke aam naagarik vahan karte hai
 After this, Avatar Krishna made a check of Rs 950 in return for the subsidy received in his train ticket and sent it to the railway
 is ghatana ke baad railway board ke adhikariyon ko yah idia aayaa ki kyon naa aam logon ke liye tikat booking ke dauraan sabsidi chhodane kaa vikalp bhi diya jaae
 According to a high official of the Railway Board, people would like to travel without subsidy, as of now, the railway is not cashing in the checks of Avatar Krishna, because there is no such system at present
 lekin agle maheene se mantralay rail tikat main sabsidi naa lene kaa vikalp bhi dene ja rahaa he
 Railways hope that there will be many people in the country who are able to pay the full fare for their rail journey and would not like to take subsidy on rail fares
 aise logon ko railway ek vikalp dena chaah rahi he jisase jahaan ek taraf sakasham log bina kisi sabsidi ke yatra kar sakenge to vahiin jo log sabsidi rate par rail yatra karnaa chahenge unke liye pareshaani bhi nahin hogi
 Passenger fares are on board the Ghat railway route recently, a meeting was held in which it was decided that the option of giving up this subsidy should be given in the rail reservation form
 khaas baat yah he ki naa sirf senior citigen yaa phir kisi duusari category main milane vaali chhot ke saathi aam yatri ko bhi yah vikalp diya jayega
 Railway officials say that there has been a continuous loss in passenger fares over the past several years due to non-increase in fares over expenditure
 third asi kaa miltaa he sahi kiraayis samay kii sthiti yah he railway kaayatrikiraaya main jitna kharchaa hota he uske mukaable vah yatri se sirf 57 fisadi kiraaya hi vasuulata he
 In this way subsidy is 43 per cent
 aisi sthiti main rail adhikariyon kaa daawa he ki kiraye main badhotaree naa hone kii vajah se railway lagaataar ghate main ja rahaa he
 If you look at the journey of every category, then only and only the passengers of the third AC get the same fare which is a little more than their expenses
 baaki anya sabhi shreniyon main yatri kiraaya kharch ke mukaable kam vasula ja rahaa he
 Railway officials can be implemented in August
 Officials of the railways say that the whole system is being prepared for the option of giving up this subsidy and it is likely that this system will be implemented by the month of August
 iske baad dekhnaa yah hoga ki kitne yatri puure kiraye par safar karnaa pasand karenge
 Salary has increased but the problem is bigger than that, we will also talk about the implementation of the Seventh Pay Commission, but will continue to do what we were doing earlier
 ucch shiksha kii haalat karaab nahin he, unki karaab he jo ucch shiksha ke liye college gaye, admician fees di, 3-4 saal vahaan bitaayaa phir bhi is baat se fark nahin padaa ki class room main padhaane ke liye koi professor nahin aayaa
 They kept waiting for the degree, none of the professors did
 jo profasar bache hue hai unamem se kai bahut acha padhaate hai, kai raajnneetik dalon kaa jhola dhote hai or kaiyon ko padhaane hi nahin aata he
 In the country in which anyone is made Vice Chancellor, the confidence of appointing professors on the basis of merit cannot be so easily created
 kuch uniwarsity main professor padhaa rahe hai, unheen par boj daalane ke nae-nae tareeke apanaae ja rahe hai taaki nae professor rakhane kii zarurat na pade or jahaan zarurat se bachanaa mushkil he, vahaan edock rakhane ke faisle ho rahe hai
 Our colleague Dinesh Mansera has sent a report that the Uttarakhand cabinet has decided to hire lecturers on contract instead of reinstatement of permanent professors
 15 din pehle lok seva ayog ko likhaa gaya tha ki 797 pad bharne kii prakriya shuru ho magar 11 oktober ke din faisla palat gaya or ab 585 lekturer theke par rakhe jaaenge
 This college, which has been running in a tin shed for four years, is from Banbasa town in Champawat district of Uttarakhand
 aspataal ke stoff quarter ke campus main tin shed ke neeche chal rahaa he college
 The college neither has its own building nor its own toilet
 chaatr aspataal ke shauchalay kaa hi istamaal karte hai
 This tin shed has five teachers for teaching six subjects
 yah ilaake kaa ekmaatr college he
 How will the studies be done, neither the students nor the students will worry about it
 koi sawaal nahin kar rahaa, sab apana samay kaat rahe hai
 In this college, 125 students are wasting their lives, their lives should not be wasted anywhere else and the responsibility falls on someone else, so the government is running this college in tin shed
 jo chaatr yahaan nahin barbaad hona chaahate wo yahaan se duusare shahar ke collejon main chale gaye hai jahaan ke collejon kii haalat kaa anumaan aap laga sakate hai
 Therefore, the state government has decided that the 585 lecturers who will be hired on contract will have to teach at 500 rupees per hour
 ve chaahe kitna bhi ghanta padhaa len magar maheene main unhen 25000 se adhik nahin milegaa
 This is called maximum minimum i
e
 maximum which is minimum
 rajya main raaj mistre kii bhi dihadi 500 he or rajkeey college ke shiksha mistre kii dihadi bhi 500 rupee hai
 This is the socialism of the liberal system
 aap bhi soch rahe honge ki ham tanakpur se sate banabasaa kaise pahunch gaye, darasal fasebuk par ek pathak ne hamen pahunchaa diya
 Many times it seems that society has abandoned higher education
 jab lekturer-professor ke bagair hi hindustan bhar ke karodon chaatr paas hote rahe hai to kyon na college system hi band kar diya jaae or shahar ke ek bade maidan main har maheene kii paanch taarikh ko jitne chaatr samaa jaaen, un sabko unki pasand ke vishay main paas ghoshit kar diya jaae
 With this, neither will there be any problem of having a professor nor vice-chancellor and education minister
 ham is series ke dauraan ek aise samaaj kii haalat dekh rahe hai jo dekhi nahin ja rahi he
 But imagine how comfortable our society has been watching this situation
 jaise wo maanata he ki aatma bhale amar na ho, collejon kii yah haalat amar zarur he
 But Jayanarayan Mohan Lal Purohit of Phalodi, who did not think of building a government postgraduate college building
 is college kii imaarat to shandaar he magar shandaar imaarat main bhi hamaari vyavasthaaen apni nishaani chhod detii hai
 Hemchand Purohit, who achieved success in Mumbai, felt that if there should be a good college building in his area, he built a building with 5 crores from his pocket
 kitne armaan se unhone paanch karod lagaakar aadhunik suvidhaon vaale post graduate college kaa nirmaan kara diya magar yahaan padhaane ke liye shikshak nahin hai
 There should be 16 lecturer-professors but only three
 27 karmchaaree hone chahie the magar 7 hi hai
 Students from 30-30 kilometers come here to do MA
 kareeb 2000 chaatro ke namakan ke baad bhi yahaan teacher nahin he
 The government can run a project to destroy 1900 students by depositing them in one place
 2011 main yah college bana kar sarkaar ko de diya gaya tha
 a new system has been detected in Rajasthan
 duusare zilon ke permanent shikshakon main se hi kisi ko ek-ek maheene ke liye bhej kar yahaan padhai hoti he, kabhi nahin hoti he
 Think about what dreams Seth Hemchand Purohit of Mumbai might have had when he built this building by planting five crores
 ve chaahate to itane main apni zamin par college banavaakar munafa kama sakate the, magar aise kam hi hote hai jo sarkaar ko imaarat banavaa kar dete hai
 He just wanted his father's name to remain, so the name of this college is Hemchand Jai Narayan Purohit College, if the government had not broken the trust, then how many industrialists like Hemchand would come forward and build a college and give it in the name of their district or village Giving, as people have done before
 hemchand ji na sirf is college ke liye 100 bigha zamin daan di, balki das bigha zamin main building banaakar bhi diya
 Now go from Rajasthan to Jharkhand
 ranchi uniwarsity kaa haal lete hai
 Ranchi University has been in operation since July 12, 1960
 aaj iske tahat 64 college hai
 There are 23 post graduate departments
 do lakh chaatr hai, naujavaanon kii itani jaagruk aabaadi jis universti main ho, vahaan to loktantr or vyavasthaaon ke chaal-chalan main swarna yug hi aa janaa chahie
 But even the students of Ranchi University, it seems that after three years somehow they are waiting for the degree, not the professor in the class
 yahaan ke khaali padon par sidhe bahaali honi chahie thi magar 1982 ke baad se hui hi nahin
 You are going into 21st century, Ranchi University is stuck in 20th century itself
 assistant professor pramotion paakar associat profasar phir profasar ban kar ritair hote gaye, siten khaali hoti gayi 
 Here the teacher is placed on the contract
 research scollar class lete hai
 Professors have to do administrative work as non-teaching staff are not recruited for these jobs
 mujhe is baat par shaq he ki bahut se chaatro ko pataa he ki unke professor ko padhaane ke liye padhanaa bhi padhata he
 Neither the professor tells nor the student asks
 sabko lagata he ki professor computer hai, on kar do, padhaanaa chaalu, isliye inase admician bhi karaao, mantri kaa swaagat bhi karaao or niabandh lekhan pratiyogita kaa incharge bhi banaao
 This is Ramlakhan Singh Yadav College of Ranchi University
 koker ilaake main yah college he, 100 kattha zamin par bana he
 Since the 80s, there has been a judicial dispute over the college's land
 yah college hamaari nyaayik prakriya kii bhi misaal he
 In 40 years, this case has not reached its end
 college main bhi kisi ne sakriyata nahin dikhaai
 There cannot be a new construction here due to the stay of the Supreme Court
 yahaan par inter se lekar grajuation ke 9500 chaatr padhate hai
 With the introduction of the choice based credit system, the need of teachers in every subject has increased
 is vakt kisi bhi vishay ke liye ek yaa do se zyaada lekturer nahin hai
 According to the new system, this college needs about 150 teachers, but according to the old system, there are only 38
 itihaas main 300 chaatro ne admician liya he magar teacher ek hi hai
 There are eight hundred students in commerce, but only 3 teachers to teach
 haalat yah he ki shikshak class le yaa imtahaan le yaa kapi check kare
 There is a three-three, four-month exam and then a copy check
 shikshak kehete hai ki phir bhi ham log padhaa lete hai, magar aap samaj sakate hai ki kya padhai hoti hogi
 The college attracts children from rural areas around Ranchi
 ek chaatr to yahaan 40 kimi se rose cycle chalaakar aata he magar system use rose fail karata hoga
 One teacher told that to deal with this pressure, we have specially designed a routine so that no more than one thousand students are on campus at any given time
 im ahambadabad ke professor ko ramlakhan singh yadav college par ek adhyayan karnaa chahie
 The college is just three kilometers away from the Chief Minister's residence, but one lakh light years away from the government's eyes
 ramlakhan singh yadav bihar ke dabang netaa hue the, inke naam par kai jagahon par college he
 In our country, there was a dispute over the making of a statue of only 200 crores
 iskaa mujhe dukh he
 The demand should have been that if the idol of Ram is being built then it should be built at a cost of 20,000 crores instead of 200
 taaki duniya ko pataa chale ki ham bharat ke naujavaanon ke liye college bhale na bana sake, jo bane hue hai, unhen bhale na bachaa sake, magar murti ham chaah len to banaakar rahenge
 Our youth will not pass by studying in class, they are getting educated by watching debates on these topics in front of the TV channel
 ramlakhan singh yadav college ke principal sahab kii baat sahi he, aakhir ve kya kar sakate hai, jab koi kuch kar hi nahin rahaa he ve kya kar sakate hai
 Our colleagues Harbans and Manoj have sent the hall of a college in Dumka
 ye ek alag uniwarsity he
 Sido Kanhu Murmu University
 is uniwarsity main dumka, devgarh, godda, jamtada, pakudaur sahibganj ke 13 mahavidhyalay aate hai
 In 1855, Sido Kanhu raised his voice against the injustice of English rule and moneylenders
 30 june, 1855 kii raat sahibganj zila ke bhogandil gaanv main 10 hazaar se adhik santhal jamaa hue the
 Sido Murmu and Kanhu Murmu declared independence that night
 inaki zudwaan bahanen chand or bhairav bhi shahid ho gai thim
 This Santhal rebellion before 1857 is a defining page in history
 chaar bhai-bahanon ke shahid hone kaa kissa kaash jamaane tak pahunchataa magar sido or kanhu ke naam par bani uniwarsity kii haalat bhi thik nahin he
 The future of 55 thousand students in this university is waiting to be bright
 is universti main 476 assitant professor hone chahie magar 288 hi hai
 188 posts are vacant
 reader ke 34 pad hone chahie magar ek bhi reader nahin he
 Only one of the 13 colleges here has the privilege of being the principal
 baaki 12 college main principal bhi nahin hai
 Students and students have understood one thing
 uniwarsity kaa matlab pariksha dena or paas kar janaa he
 During this series, students and professors from many places told on the phone that there is only one thing that is going on
 imtahaan kaa farm bharaana or imtahaan karana
 Apart from this, all work is closed
 har college main principal or uniwarsity main visi kaa cameraa or aphis chamakta hua milegaa
 Pottery will definitely be found there
 padhai barbaad kar, paryaavaran kii raksha karte hue
 Teachers know what the reality is, so they are unable to claim it either
 yah baat sahi he
 When there is no one to teach, then what is left will teach the whole
 jharkhand ke do vishvavidhyalayon kaa haal hamane dekha
 Now i feel proud to tell the condition of Vinoba Bhave University in North Chotanagpur
 yahi ki hamaare aaj ke netaaon ne yaad karne ke maamle main kisi bhi netaa ko nahin choda
 On seeing the sign of anyone who has remembered, the soul trembles in the name of remembrance
 ab kuch ho kisi kii smriti main kuch bhi na bane
 There is also a shortage of 70 percent teachers in this university
 maatr 30 pratishat bache hue shikshakon ke bharose yah uniwarsity tal rahi he
 Students complain, the complaint is heard
 hamaare desh main karrwai bhale na ho, sunwaayee ho jaati he
 Now, many people consider the hearing to be action and postpone their sit-in till the next strike
 jo shikshak bache hue hai unhen college ke prashasan kaa kaam bhi karnaa hota he
 Even if the work of education stops, the work of administration should not stop
 bharat kii janata isi yakeen main soti he ki shashan kaa prashasan chal rahaa he
 The rest of the hospitals, schools do not run, what is the difference
 uniwarsity main ab is baat ko lekar ummid jaagi he ki 9 saal baad prophessoron kii bahaali kii kavayad shuru ho rahi he
 No one knows if there will be 70 per cent restoration, but the restoration is going to happen, hearing this, there has been a cloud of expectations
 professor ke aane kaa anumaan mausam vibhaag ke anumaan jaisaa ho gaya hai
 India will be the only country in the world where so many colleges have been opened for not teaching
 is halaat main aapako reating naam ke jhunjhane se dhokhaa diya jaataa he ki bharat main bhi duniya kii tarah reating shuru ho gai he
 Now colleges will be ranked
 is series ke dauraan yah bhi samaj aa rahaa he ki collejon kii grading ke liye neshnal acredation council (nack) kaa system bhi naakaafi or naakaam he
 a teacher from Surat said that when a team of Naik comes to our city, they have to send a sari and a box of sweets
 kai jagahon par nack kii team acha kaam bhi kar jaati he
 But what will happen with the NAC and rating, do you know that there are not 70 percent professors in such and such college
 hazaar se lekar das das hazaar chaatro kaa bhavishya admician fees lekar barbaad kiya ja rahaa he
 But this issue is not necessary
 murti banani chahie
 Heard that politicians have started drinking poison
 bharat ke lakhon-karodon chaatro ne uniwarsity main jaakar jo amrit piya he, usne hamaari vyavasthaaon ke saahas ko amar kar diya he or chaatro ko jarjar
 This line will be understood only when you read it four times and listen five times
 tippaniyan There is a happy news for the teachers of University
 aisa nahin he ki karaab system main khushiyaan nahin aati hai
 Come and will come
 prophessoron ke jivan main saatven vetan ayog kaa aagaman hua he, badhai
 The salary of teachers of Central University, State University and Aided College has increased
 is ghoshnaa se pataa chalaa ki bharat main 7 lakh, 58 hazaar professor hai
 i wish i could also find out how many lakh professors are not there in India
 selary zaruri he, kyonki jo bache hue professor-lekturer hai, padhaane ke liye kaaphi mehnat karte hai, khaskar hamane dilli uniwarsity main to dekha he, hamaare teacher hamen padhaane ke liye ghar par 5-5 ghante rose pard kar aate the
 Then we came to know for the first time that to teach we also have to read
 jo nahin padhaate hai wo principal yaa sattarudh dal kaa zaruri kaam karte hai
 That too is the work of nation building
 chaatr nirmaan se bhi bada kaam he raashtra nirmaan
 It is expected that there will be a press conference on the vacant posts as well
 jisamen bataaya jayega ki bahaali kii prakriya kaise paardarshee hogi
 Those who take the bag of the ruling party, not the readers, will get jobs
 jis mulk main kisi ko bhi vaais chancelar bana diya jaataa ho, vahaan sirf yogyata ke aadhaar par prophessoron kii niyukti kaa bharosa itani aasaani se paidaa nahin ho saktaa he
 Some universities are teaching professors, new ways of burdening them are being adopted so that there is no need to hire new professors and where it is difficult to avoid need, decisions are being made to keep adhoc
 hamaare sahyogi dinesh mansera ne report bheji he ki uttarakhand mantrimandal ne permanent profasaron kii bahaali kii jagah theke par lekturer rakhe jane kaa faisla kiya he
 15 days ago, it was written to the Public Service Commission that the process of filling 797 posts should start but on October 11, the decision was reversed and now 585 lecturers will be hired
 chaar saal se tin shed main chal rahaa yah college uttarakhand ke champavat zile ke banabasaa shahar kaa he
 The college is running under a tin shed in the campus of the staff quarters of the hospital
 college ke paas na to apni imaarat he na apana shauchalay
 Students use the hospital toilet
 is tin shed main chah vishyon kii padhai ke liye paanch teacher hai
 It is the only college in the area
 padhai kaise hoti hogi isaki phikr na to padhane waalon ko hogi or na padhaane waalon ko
 No one is asking, everyone is spending their time
 is college main sava sau chaatr apana jivan barbaad kar rahe hai, unka jivan kahin or barbaad na ho or uski zimmedaari kisi or na par aa jaae, isliye sarkaar tin shed main yah college chalaa rahi he
 Students who do not want to be wasted here have gone to colleges in other cities from here, where you can estimate the condition of colleges
 isliye rajya sarkaar ne tay kiya he ki jo 585 lekturer theke par rakhe jaaenge unhen 500 rupaya prati ghanta par padhaanaa hoga
 No matter how many hours they read, they will not get more than 25000 in a month
 ise adhiktam nunatam kehete hai yani jo minimum he vahi adhiktam
 Raj Mistry also has a daily wage of 500 in the state and Shiksha Mistry of Government College also has a salary of 500 rupees
 ye udaaravaadi system kaa samaajwaad he
 You may also be wondering how we reached Banbasa adjacent to Tanakpur, in fact a reader on Facebook reached us
 kai baar lagata he ki samaaj ne hi ucch shiksha ko chhod diya he
 When crores of students from all over India have been passing without lecturer-professors, then why not stop the college system and all the students of the city on the 5th of every month, in a big ground in the city The pass should be declared in isse to na to professor rakhane kaa jhanjhat hoga na hi vaais chancelar or shiksha mantri
 We are witnessing the condition of a society which is not being seen during this series
 magar sochie is haalat ko hamaara samaaj kitne aaraam se dekhtaa aa rahaa he
 Just as he believes that the soul may not be immortal, this condition of colleges is definitely immortal
 lekin falodi ke jainarayan mohan laal purohit rajkeey snatakottar mahavidhyalay kii imaarat banane vaale ne aisa nahin sochaa
 The building of this college is magnificent, but even in the magnificent building, our systems leave their mark
 mumbai jaakar kamyaabi hasil karne vaale hemchand purohit ko laga ki unke ilaake main college kii acchhee imaarat honi chahie to apni jeb se 5 karod lagaakar imaarat bana di
 With so much armament, he has invested five crores to build a post graduate college with modern facilities but there are no teachers to teach here
 16 lekturer-professor hone chahie magar hai sirf teen
 There should have been 27 employees but there are only 7
 30-30 kilometre se chaatr yahaan eme karne aate hai
 Even after enrollment of nearly 2000 students, there is no teacher here
 1900 chaatro ko ek jagah jamaa kar barbaad karne kaa project sarkarein hi chalaa sakati hai
 In 2011, this college was formed and given to the government
 rajasthan main ek nae system kaa pataa chalaa he
 Only one of the permanent teachers of other districts is sent here for one month and studies here, never happens
 sochie mumbai ke seth hemchand purohit ne kya-kya sapane dekhe honge jab unhone paanch karod lagaakar yah imaarat banavaai hogi
 If they wanted, they could earn profits by building a college on their land, but there are very few who make the government get the building done
 unhone bas itnaa chaha ki unke pita kaa naam rah jaae isliye is college kaa naam he hemchand jai narayan purohit mahavidhyalay, agar sarkaar ne bharosa nahin todaa hota to hemchand jaise kitne hi udyogpati aage aate or college bana kar apane zile yaa gaanv ke naam par de dete, jaisaa ki pehle bhi log karte rahe hai
 Hemchand ji not only donated 100 bighas of land for this college, but also built buildings in ten bighas of land
 rajasthan se chalate hai ab jharkhand
 Lets take the position of Ranchi University
 12 july, 1960 se ranchi universti chal rahi he
 Today there are 64 colleges under it
 23 post graduate vibhaag hai
 There are two lakh students, in the university where such a conscious population of young people is, there should be a golden age in the practice of democracy and systems
 magar ranchi uniwarsity ke chaatr bhi, lagata he ki class main professor kaa nahin, teen saal baad kisi tarah degree kaa intazaar karte rah jate hai
 The vacant posts here should have been restored directly, but not since 1982
 aap 21veen sadi main ja rahe hai, ranchi uniwarsity 20veen sadi main hi fansi padi he
 After getting promotion to Assistant Professor, Associate Professor then retired as a professor and the seats were vacant
 yahaan kantrect par teacher rakhe jate hai
 Research scholars take classes
 prophessoron ko prashasnic kaam karne hote hai kyonki in kaamon ke liye non teaching staff kii bhartee nahin hoti he
 i doubt that many students know that reading to teach their professor is also teaching
 na professor bataate hai or na chaatr poochhate hai
 Everyone feels that professors are computers, turn them on, teach on, so get admission from them, welcome the minister and also make charge of essay writing competition
 ranchi uniwarsity kaa yah ramlakhan singh yadav college he
 It is a college in the Koker area, 100 katha is built on the ground
 80 ke dashak se hi college kii zamin ko lekar nyaayik vivaad chal rahaa he
 This college is also an example of our judicial process
 40 saal main yah mukadmaa anjaam par nahin pahunchaa he
 Nobody showed activeness even in college
 supreme court ke ste ke kaaran yahaan par nayaa nirmaan nahin ho saktaa he
 It has 9500 students studying from inter to graduation
 chwis besd credit system lagu hone ke baad har vishay main shikshakon kii zarurat bad gai he
 Currently there are no more than one or two lecturers for any subject
 nae system ke hisaab se is college ko 150 ke kareeb shikshak chahie magar puraane system ke hisaab se 38 hi hai
 300 students have taken admission in history but the teacher is the same
 commers main aath sau chaatr hai, magar padhaane ke liye maatr 3 teacher hai
 The condition is that the teacher should take class or test or check the copy
 teen-teen, chaar-chaar maheenaa pariksha hoti he or phir kapi check hoti hai
 The teacher says that we still teach, but you can understand what education will be
 is college main ranchi ke aas-paas ke gramin ilaake se bachche padhane aate hai
 a student comes here cycling daily from 40 km, but the system fails him daily
 ek shikshak ne bataaya ki is dabaav se nipatane ke liye hamane khaas tarah se routine banaaya he taaki kisi vakt ek hazaar se adhik chaatr campus main na ho
 The professor at IIM Ahmadabad should do a study on Ramlakhan Singh Yadav College
 yah college mukhyamantri ke awaas se maatr teen kilometre kii duuri par he magar sarkaar kii nigaah se ek lakh prakaash varsh dur he
 Ramlakhan Singh Yadav was a strong politician of Bihar, there is a college in his name
 hamaare mulk main maatr 200 karod kii murti banane par vivaad ho gaya
 i am sorry for this maang yah honi chahie tha ki ram kii murti ban rahi he to 200 kii jagah 20,000 karod kii laagat se banani chahie
 So that the world knows that we may not be able to build a college for the youth of India, may not save those who have remained, but if we wish, the idol will be built
 hamaare yuva ab class rup main padhakar paas nahin honge, ve tivi channel ke saamne in vishyon par dibet dekhte hue agucated ho rahe hai
 The principal of Ramlakhan Singh Yadav College is right, what can they do when someone is not doing anything, what can they do
 hamaare sahyogi harbans or manoj ne dumka ke ek college kaa haal bheja he
 It is a separate university
 sido kanhu murmu uniwarsity
 The university has 13 colleges in Dumka, Deoghar, Godda, Jamtara, Pakur and Sahebganj
 1855 main sido kanhu ne angrezi hukumat or sahukaaron ke anyaay ke kilaaf awaz buland kii thi
 On the night of 30 June 1855, more than 10 thousand Santhals had gathered in Bhogandil village of Sahebganj district
 sido murmu or kanhu murmu ne us raat azaadi kaa elaan kar diya
 Their twin sisters Chand and Bhairav were also martyred
 1857 se pehle kaa yah santhal vidroh itihaas kaa ek nirnaayak panna he
 The story of the martyrdom of four siblings reaches the times, but the condition of the university named after Sido and Kanhu is also not good
 is uniwarsity main 55 hazaar chaatro kaa bhavishya ujjwal hone kaa intazaar kar rahaa he
 There should be 476 assistant professors in this university but there are only 288
 188 pad rikt hai
 There should be 34 posts of a reader but not a single reader
 yahaan ke 13 mahavidhyalayon main se sirf ek ke paas principal hone kaa saubhaahgya praapt hai
 The remaining 12 colleges do not even have principals
 chaatr or chaatraon ko ek baat samaj aa gai he
 University means taking and passing the exam
 is series ke dauraan kai jagahon ke chaatro or profasaron ne phone par bataaya ki ek hi kaam he jo chal rahaa he
 To fill the examination form and get the examination done
 iske alaava sab kaam band hai
 In every college, the principal and the vc's room and office in the university will be found shining
 vahaan gamale zarur milenge
 Protecting the environment, ruining studies
 shikshak jaanate hai ki hakeekat kya he, isliye daawa bhi nahin kar pate hai
 This is true
 jab padhaane vaala hoga hi nahin to jo bachaa hua he wo kaise sara padhaa degaa
 We have seen the condition of two universities of Jharkhand
 ab uttari chotanagpur ke vinoba bhaave uniwarsity kaa haal bataate hue garv sa mahasoos ho rahaa he
 That our today's leaders have not left any leaders in the matter of remembrance
 jise bhi yaad kiya he unki nishaani dekhakar yaad ke naam se hi ruh kaanp uthati he
 Now, nothing should be made in anyone's memory
 is uniwarsity main bhi 70 pratishat shikshakon kii kami bataai ja rahi he
 This university is postponed due to the remaining 30 percent teachers
 chaatr shikaayat karte hai, shikaayat sun lee jaati he
 Even if there is no action in our country, a hearing takes place
 ab to bahut se log sunwaayee ko hi karrwai samaj kar apana dharna agle dharne tak ke liye sthagit kar dete hai
 The teachers who remain are also required to do the administration of the college
 padhai kaa kaam bhale hi ruk jaae, prashasan kaa kaam nahin ruknaa chahie
 The people of India sleep in the belief that governance is going on
 baaki aspataal, skool chale na chale, kya fark padataa he
 There is hope in the university that after 9 years, the exercise of reinstatement of professors is starting
 kisi ko pataa nahin ki kya 70 fisadi bahaali hogi, magar bahaali hone ja rahi he yahi sunakar ummiido ke badal chaa gaye hai
 The estimate of the professor's arrival has become like the estimate of the Meteorological Department
 bharat duniya kaa akelaa desh hoga jahaan nahin padhaane ke liye itane college khole gaye hai
 In this situation you are deceived by the annoyance of the name of rating that the rating has started in India like the world
 ab collejon kii ranking hogi
 During this series, it is also understood that the National Accreditation Council (NAC) system for grading colleges is also insufficient and unsuccessful
 surat kii ek shikshika ne kaha ki hamaare shahar main nack kii team aati he to unhen sari or mithai kaa dibba dekar bhejnaa hota he
 In many places, Naik's team also does a good job
 par nack or reating se kya hoga, kya aapako pataa chalegaa ki falaan college main 70 fisadi professor nahin hai
 The future of ten thousand to ten thousand students is being wasted by taking admission fees
 magar yah masalaa zaruri nahin he
 The idol should be made
 suna he netaa log zehar pine lage hai
 The nectar that millions of students of India have drank by going to university has immortalized the courage of our systems and the students are shabby
 yah pankti tabhi samaj aegi jab aap ise chaar baar padhenge or paanch baar sunenge
 The comments universti ke shikshakon ke liye ek khushi kii khabar he
 It is not that bad systems do not bring happiness
 aati hai or aati rahengi
 The seventh pay commission has arrived in the life of the professors, congratulations
 centrel uniwarsity, state universti or aded college ke shikshakon kaa vetan badha he
 This announcement showed that there are 7 lakh, 58 thousand professors in India
 kaash yah bhi pataa chal jaataa ki bharat main kitne lakh professor nahin hai
 Salary is important, because the remaining professors and lecturers work hard to teach, especially as we have seen at Delhi University, our teachers used to study at home for 5-5 hours everyday to teach us
 tab hamen pehali baar pataa chalaa tha ki padhaane ke liye padhanaa bhi padataa he
 Those who do not teach do the essential work of the principal or the ruling party
 wo bhi raashtra nirmaan kaa hi kaam he
 Nation building is a bigger task than student building
 ummid he khaali padon par bhi ek press conference hogi
 Which will explain how the restoration process will be transparent
 sattarudh dal kaa jhola uthaane waalon kii nahin, padhane waalon ko naukari milegi
 You may also be wondering how we reached Banbasa adjacent to Tanakpur, in fact a reader on Facebook reached us
 kai baar lagata he ki samaaj ne hi ucch shiksha ko chhod diya he
 When crores of students from all over India have been passing without lecturer-professors, then why not stop the college system and all the students of the city on the 5th of every month, in a big ground in the city The pass should be declared in isse to na to professor rakhane kaa jhanjhat hoga na hi vaais chancelar or shiksha mantri
 We are witnessing the condition of a society which is not being seen during this series
 magar sochie is haalat ko hamaara samaaj kitne aaraam se dekhtaa aa rahaa he
 Just as he believes that the soul may not be immortal, this condition of colleges is definitely immortal
 lekin falodi ke jainarayan mohan laal purohit rajkeey snatakottar mahavidhyalay kii imaarat banane vaale ne aisa nahin sochaa
 The building of this college is magnificent, but even in the magnificent building, our systems leave their mark
 mumbai jaakar kamyaabi hasil karne vaale hemchand purohit ko laga ki unke ilaake main college kii acchhee imaarat honi chahie to apni jeb se 5 karod lagaakar imaarat bana di
 With so much armament, he has invested five crores to build a post graduate college with modern facilities but there are no teachers to teach here
 16 lekturer-professor hone chahie magar hai sirf teen
 There should have been 27 employees but there are only 7
 30-30 kilometre se chaatr yahaan eme karne aate hai
 Even after enrollment of nearly 2000 students, there is no teacher here
 1900 chaatro ko ek jagah jamaa kar barbaad karne kaa project sarkarein hi chalaa sakati hai
 In 2011, this college was formed and given to the government
 rajasthan main ek nae system kaa pataa chalaa he
 Only one of the permanent teachers of other districts is sent here for one month and studies here, never happens
 sochie mumbai ke seth hemchand purohit ne kya-kya sapane dekhe honge jab unhone paanch karod lagaakar yah imaarat banavaai hogi
 If they wanted, they could earn profits by building a college on their land, but there are very few who make the government get the building done
 unhone bas itnaa chaha ki unke pita kaa naam rah jaae isliye is college kaa naam he hemchand jai narayan purohit mahavidhyalay, agar sarkaar ne bharosa nahin todaa hota to hemchand jaise kitne hi udyogpati aage aate or college bana kar apane zile yaa gaanv ke naam par de dete, jaisaa ki pehle bhi log karte rahe hai
 Hemchand ji not only donated 100 bighas of land for this college, but also built buildings in ten bighas of land
 rajasthan se chalate hai ab jharkhand
 Lets take the position of Ranchi University
 12 july, 1960 se ranchi universti chal rahi he
 Today there are 64 colleges under it
 23 post graduate vibhaag hai
 There are two lakh students, in the university where such a conscious population of young people is, there should be a golden age in the practice of democracy and systems
 magar ranchi uniwarsity ke chaatr bhi, lagata he ki class main professor kaa nahin, teen saal baad kisi tarah degree kaa intazaar karte rah jate hai
 The vacant posts here should have been restored directly, but not since 1982
 aap 21veen sadi main ja rahe hai, ranchi uniwarsity 20veen sadi main hi fansi padi he
 After getting promotion to Assistant Professor, Associate Professor then retired as a professor and the seats were vacant
 yahaan kantrect par teacher rakhe jate hai
 Research scholars take classes
 prophessoron ko prashasnic kaam karne hote hai kyonki in kaamon ke liye non teaching staff kii bhartee nahin hoti he
 i doubt that many students know that reading to teach their professor is also teaching
 na professor bataate hai or na chaatr poochhate hai
 Everyone feels that professors are computers, turn them on, teach on, so get admission from them, welcome the minister and also make charge of essay writing competition
 ranchi uniwarsity kaa yah ramlakhan singh yadav college he
 It is a college in the Koker area, 100 katha is built on the ground
 80 ke dashak se hi college kii zamin ko lekar nyaayik vivaad chal rahaa he
 This college is also an example of our judicial process
 40 saal main yah mukadmaa anjaam par nahin pahunchaa he
 Nobody showed activeness even in college
 supreme court ke ste ke kaaran yahaan par nayaa nirmaan nahin ho saktaa he
 It has 9500 students studying from inter to graduation
 chwis besd credit system lagu hone ke baad har vishay main shikshakon kii zarurat bad gai he
 Currently there are no more than one or two lecturers for any subject
 nae system ke hisaab se is college ko 150 ke kareeb shikshak chahie magar puraane system ke hisaab se 38 hi hai

 But Jayanarayan Mohan Lal Purohit of Phalodi, who did not think of building a government postgraduate college building
 is college kii imaarat to shandaar he magar shandaar imaarat main bhi hamaari vyavasthaaen apni nishaani chhod detii hai
 Hemchand Purohit, who achieved success in Mumbai, felt that if there should be a good college building in his area, he built a building with 5 crores from his pocket
 kitne armaan se unhone paanch karod lagaakar aadhunik suvidhaon vaale post graduate college kaa nirmaan kara diya magar yahaan padhaane ke liye shikshak nahin hai
 There should be 16 lecturer-professors but only three
 27 karmchaaree hone chahie the magar 7 hi hai
 Students from 30-30 kilometers come here to do MA
 kareeb 2000 chaatro ke namakan ke baad bhi yahaan teacher nahin he
 The government can run a project to destroy 1900 students by depositing them in one place
 2011 main yah college bana kar sarkaar ko de diya gaya tha
 a new system has been detected in Rajasthan
 duusare zilon ke permanent shikshakon main se hi kisi ko ek-ek maheene ke liye bhej kar yahaan padhai hoti he, kabhi nahin hoti he
 Think about what dreams Seth Hemchand Purohit of Mumbai might have had when he built this building by planting five crores
 ve chaahate to itane main apni zamin par college banavaakar munafa kama sakate the, magar aise kam hi hote hai jo sarkaar ko imaarat banavaa kar dete hai
 He just wanted his father's name to remain, so the name of this college is Hemchand Jai Narayan Purohit College, if the government had not broken the trust, then how many industrialists like Hemchand would come forward and build a college and give it in the name of their district or village Giving, as people have done before
 hemchand ji na sirf is college ke liye 100 bigha zamin daan di, balki das bigha zamin main building banaakar bhi diya
 Now go from Rajasthan to Jharkhand
 ranchi uniwarsity kaa haal lete hai
 Ranchi University has been in operation since July 12, 1960
 aaj iske tahat 64 college hai
 There are 23 post graduate departments
 do lakh chaatr hai, naujavaanon kii itani jaagruk aabaadi jis universti main ho, vahaan to loktantr or vyavasthaaon ke chaal-chalan main swarna yug hi aa janaa chahie
 But even the students of Ranchi University, it seems that after three years somehow they are waiting for the degree, not the professor in the class
 yahaan ke khaali padon par sidhe bahaali honi chahie thi magar 1982 ke baad se hui hi nahin
 You are going into 21st century, Ranchi University is stuck in 20th century itself
 assistant professor pramotion paakar associat profasar phir profasar ban kar ritair hote gaye, siten khaali hoti gayi 
 Here the teacher is placed on the contract
 research scollar class lete hai
 Professors have to do administrative work as non-teaching staff are not recruited for these jobs
 mujhe is baat par shaq he ki bahut se chaatro ko pataa he ki unke professor ko padhaane ke liye padhanaa bhi padhata he
 Neither the professor tells nor the student asks
 sabko lagata he ki professor computer hai, on kar do, padhaanaa chaalu, isliye inase admician bhi karaao, mantri kaa swaagat bhi karaao or niabandh lekhan pratiyogita kaa incharge bhi banaao
 This is Ramlakhan Singh Yadav College of Ranchi University
 koker ilaake main yah college he, 100 kattha zamin par bana he
 Since the 80s, there has been a judicial dispute over the college's land
 yah college hamaari nyaayik prakriya kii bhi misaal he
 In 40 years, this case has not reached its end
 college main bhi kisi ne sakriyata nahin dikhaai
 There cannot be a new construction here due to the stay of the Supreme Court
 yahaan par inter se lekar grajuation ke 9500 chaatr padhate hai
 With the introduction of the choice based credit system, the need of teachers in every subject has increased
 is vakt kisi bhi vishay ke liye ek yaa do se zyaada lekturer nahin hai
 According to the new system, this college needs about 150 teachers, but according to the old system, there are only 38
 itihaas main 300 chaatro ne admician liya he magar teacher ek hi hai
 There are eight hundred students in commerce, but only 3 teachers to teach
 haalat yah he ki shikshak class le yaa imtahaan le yaa kapi check kare
 There is a three-three, four-month exam and then a copy check
 shikshak kehete hai ki phir bhi ham log padhaa lete hai, magar aap samaj sakate hai ki kya padhai hoti hogi
 The college attracts children from rural areas around Ranchi
 ek chaatr to yahaan 40 kimi se rose cycle chalaakar aata he magar system use rose fail karata hoga
 One teacher told that to deal with this pressure, we have specially designed a routine so that no more than one thousand students are on campus at any given time
 im ahambadabad ke professor ko ramlakhan singh yadav college par ek adhyayan karnaa chahie
 The college is just three kilometers away from the Chief Minister's residence, but one lakh light years away from the government's eyes
 ramlakhan singh yadav bihar ke dabang netaa hue the, inke naam par kai jagahon par college he
 In our country, there was a dispute over the making of a statue of only 200 crores
 iskaa mujhe dukh he
 The demand should have been that if the idol of Ram is being built then it should be built at a cost of 20,000 crores instead of 200
 taaki duniya ko pataa chale ki ham bharat ke naujavaanon ke liye college bhale na bana sake, jo bane hue hai, unhen bhale na bachaa sake, magar murti ham chaah len to banaakar rahenge
 Our youth will not pass by studying in class, they are getting educated by watching debates on these topics in front of the TV channel
 ramlakhan singh yadav college ke principal sahab kii baat sahi he, aakhir ve kya kar sakate hai, jab koi kuch kar hi nahin rahaa he ve kya kar sakate hai
 Our colleagues Harbans and Manoj have sent the hall of a college in Dumka
 ye ek alag uniwarsity he
 Sido Kanhu Murmu University
 is uniwarsity main dumka, devgarh, godda, jamtada, pakudaur sahibganj ke 13 mahavidhyalay aate hai
 In 1855, Sido Kanhu raised his voice against the injustice of English rule and moneylenders
 30 june, 1855 kii raat sahibganj zila ke bhogandil gaanv main 10 hazaar se adhik santhal jamaa hue the
 Sido Murmu and Kanhu Murmu declared independence that night
 inaki zudwaan bahanen chand or bhairav bhi shahid ho gai thim
 This Santhal rebellion before 1857 is a defining page in history
 chaar bhai-bahanon ke shahid hone kaa kissa kaash jamaane tak pahunchataa magar sido or kanhu ke naam par bani uniwarsity kii haalat bhi thik nahin he
 The future of 55 thousand students in this university is waiting to be bright
 is universti main 476 assitant professor hone chahie magar 288 hi hai
 188 posts are vacant
 reader ke 34 pad hone chahie magar ek bhi reader nahin he
 Only one of the 13 colleges here has the privilege of being the principal
 baaki 12 college main principal bhi nahin hai
 Students and students have understood one thing
 uniwarsity kaa matlab pariksha dena or paas kar janaa he
 During this series, students and professors from many places told on the phone that there is only one thing that is going on
 imtahaan kaa farm bharaana or imtahaan karana
 Apart from this, all work is closed
 har college main principal or uniwarsity main visi kaa cameraa or aphis chamakta hua milegaa
 Pottery will definitely be found there
 padhai barbaad kar, paryaavaran kii raksha karte hue
 Teachers know what the reality is, so they are unable to claim it either
 yah baat sahi he
 When there is no one to teach, then what is left will teach the whole
 jharkhand ke do vishvavidhyalayon kaa haal hamane dekha
 Now i feel proud to tell the condition of Vinoba Bhave University in North Chotanagpur
 yahi ki hamaare aaj ke netaaon ne yaad karne ke maamle main kisi bhi netaa ko nahin choda
 On seeing the sign of anyone who has remembered, the soul trembles in the name of remembrance
 ab kuch ho kisi kii smriti main kuch bhi na bane
 There is also a shortage of 70 percent teachers in this university
 maatr 30 pratishat bache hue shikshakon ke bharose yah uniwarsity tal rahi he
 Students complain, the complaint is heard
 hamaare desh main karrwai bhale na ho, sunwaayee ho jaati he
 Now, many people consider the hearing to be action and postpone their sit-in till the next strike
 jo shikshak bache hue hai unhen college ke prashasan kaa kaam bhi karnaa hota he
 Even if the work of education stops, the work of administration should not stop
 bharat kii janata isi yakeen main soti he ki shashan kaa prashasan chal rahaa he
 The rest of the hospitals, schools do not run, what is the difference
 uniwarsity main ab is baat ko lekar ummid jaagi he ki 9 saal baad prophessoron kii bahaali kii kavayad shuru ho rahi he
 No one knows if there will be 70 per cent restoration, but the restoration is going to happen, hearing this, there has been a cloud of expectations
 professor ke aane kaa anumaan mausam vibhaag ke anumaan jaisaa ho gaya hai
 India will be the only country in the world where so many colleges have been opened for not teaching
 is halaat main aapako reating naam ke jhunjhane se dhokhaa diya jaataa he ki bharat main bhi duniya kii tarah reating shuru ho gai he
 Now colleges will be ranked
 is series ke dauraan yah bhi samaj aa rahaa he ki collejon kii grading ke liye neshnal acredation council (nack) kaa system bhi naakaafi or naakaam he
 a teacher from Surat said that when a team of Naik comes to our city, they have to send a sari and a box of sweets
 kai jagahon par nack kii team acha kaam bhi kar jaati he
 But what will happen with the NAC and rating, do you know that there are not 70 percent professors in such and such college
 hazaar se lekar das das hazaar chaatro kaa bhavishya admician fees lekar barbaad kiya ja rahaa he
 But this issue is not necessary
 murti banani chahie
 Heard that politicians have started drinking poison
 bharat ke lakhon-karodon chaatro ne uniwarsity main jaakar jo amrit piya he, usne hamaari vyavasthaaon ke saahas ko amar kar diya he or chaatro ko jarjar
 This line will be understood only when you read it four times and listen five times
 tippaniyan There is a happy news for the teachers of University
 aisa nahin he ki karaab system main khushiyaan nahin aati hai
 Come and will come
 prophessoron ke jivan main saatven vetan ayog kaa aagaman hua he, badhai
 The salary of teachers of Central University, State University and Aided College has increased
 is ghoshnaa se pataa chalaa ki bharat main 7 lakh, 58 hazaar professor hai
 i wish i could also find out how many lakh professors are not there in India
 selary zaruri he, kyonki jo bache hue professor-lekturer hai, padhaane ke liye kaaphi mehnat karte hai, khaskar hamane dilli uniwarsity main to dekha he, hamaare teacher hamen padhaane ke liye ghar par 5-5 ghante rose pard kar aate the
 Then we came to know for the first time that to teach we also have to read
 jo nahin padhaate hai wo principal yaa sattarudh dal kaa zaruri kaam karte hai
 That too is the work of nation building
 chaatr nirmaan se bhi bada kaam he raashtra nirmaan
 It is expected that there will be a press conference on the vacant posts as well
 jisamen bataaya jayega ki bahaali kii prakriya kaise paardarshee hogi
 Those who take the bag of the ruling party, not the readers, will get jobs
 rajasthan main ek nae system kaa pataa chalaa he
 Only one of the permanent teachers of other districts is sent here for one month and studies here, never happens
 sochie mumbai ke seth hemchand purohit ne kya-kya sapane dekhe honge jab unhone paanch karod lagaakar yah imaarat banavaai hogi
 If they wanted, they could earn profits by building a college on their land, but there are very few who make the government get the building done
 unhone bas itnaa chaha ki unke pita kaa naam rah jaae isliye is college kaa naam he hemchand jai narayan purohit mahavidhyalay, agar sarkaar ne bharosa nahin todaa hota to hemchand jaise kitne hi udyogpati aage aate or college bana kar apane zile yaa gaanv ke naam par de dete, jaisaa ki pehle bhi log karte rahe hai
 Hemchand ji not only donated 100 bighas of land for this college, but also built buildings in ten bighas of land
 rajasthan se chalate hai ab jharkhand
 Lets take the position of Ranchi University
 12 july, 1960 se ranchi universti chal rahi he
 Today there are 64 colleges under it
 23 post graduate vibhaag hai
 There are two lakh students, in the university where such a conscious population of young people is, there should be a golden age in the practice of democracy and systems
 magar ranchi uniwarsity ke chaatr bhi, lagata he ki class main professor kaa nahin, teen saal baad kisi tarah degree kaa intazaar karte rah jate hai
 The vacant posts here should have been restored directly, but not since 1982
 aap 21veen sadi main ja rahe hai, ranchi uniwarsity 20veen sadi main hi fansi padi he
 After getting promotion to Assistant Professor, Associate Professor then retired as a professor and the seats were vacant
 yahaan kantrect par teacher rakhe jate hai
 Research scholars take classes
 prophessoron ko prashasnic kaam karne hote hai kyonki in kaamon ke liye non teaching staff kii bhartee nahin hoti he
 i doubt that many students know that reading to teach their professor is also teaching
 na professor bataate hai or na chaatr poochhate hai
 Everyone feels that professors are computers, turn them on, teach on, so get admission from them, welcome the minister and also make charge of essay writing competition
 ranchi uniwarsity kaa yah ramlakhan singh yadav college he
 It is a college in the Koker area, 100 katha is built on the ground
 80 ke dashak se hi college kii zamin ko lekar nyaayik vivaad chal rahaa he
 This college is also an example of our judicial process
 40 saal main yah mukadmaa anjaam par nahin pahunchaa he
 Nobody showed activeness even in college
 supreme court ke ste ke kaaran yahaan par nayaa nirmaan nahin ho saktaa he
 It has 9500 students studying from inter to graduation
 chwis besd credit system lagu hone ke baad har vishay main shikshakon kii zarurat bad gai he
 Currently there are no more than one or two lecturers for any subject
 nae system ke hisaab se is college ko 150 ke kareeb shikshak chahie magar puraane system ke hisaab se 38 hi hai
 300 students have taken admission in history but the teacher is the same
 commers main aath sau chaatr hai, magar padhaane ke liye maatr 3 teacher hai
 The condition is that the teacher should take class or test or check the copy
 teen-teen, chaar-chaar maheenaa pariksha hoti he or phir kapi check hoti hai
 The teacher says that we still teach, but you can understand what education will be
 is college main ranchi ke aas-paas ke gramin ilaake se bachche padhane aate hai
 a student comes here cycling daily from 40 km, but the system fails him daily
 ek shikshak ne bataaya ki is dabaav se nipatane ke liye hamane khaas tarah se routine banaaya he taaki kisi vakt ek hazaar se adhik chaatr campus main na ho
 The professor at IIM Ahmadabad should do a study on Ramlakhan Singh Yadav College
 yah college mukhyamantri ke awaas se maatr teen kilometre kii duuri par he magar sarkaar kii nigaah se ek lakh prakaash varsh dur he
 Ramlakhan Singh Yadav was a strong politician of Bihar, there is a college in his name
 hamaare mulk main maatr 200 karod kii murti banane par vivaad ho gaya
 i am sorry for this maang yah honi chahie tha ki ram kii murti ban rahi he to 200 kii jagah 20,000 karod kii laagat se banani chahie
 So that the world knows that we may not be able to build a college for the youth of India, may not save those who have remained, but if we wish, the idol will be built
 hamaare yuva ab class rup main padhakar paas nahin honge, ve tivi channel ke saamne in vishyon par dibet dekhte hue agucated ho rahe hai
 The principal of Ramlakhan Singh Yadav College is right, what can they do when someone is not doing anything, what can they do
 hamaare sahyogi harbans or manoj ne dumka ke ek college kaa haal bheja he
 It is a separate university
 sido kanhu murmu uniwarsity
 The university has 13 colleges in Dumka, Deoghar, Godda, Jamtara, Pakur and Sahebganj
 1855 main sido kanhu ne angrezi hukumat or sahukaaron ke anyaay ke kilaaf awaz buland kii thi
 On the night of 30 June 1855, more than 10 thousand Santhals had gathered in Bhogandil village of Sahebganj district
 sido murmu or kanhu murmu ne us raat azaadi kaa elaan kar diya
 Their twin sisters Chand and Bhairav were also martyred
 1857 se pehle kaa yah santhal vidroh itihaas kaa ek nirnaayak panna he
 The story of the martyrdom of four siblings reaches the times, but the condition of the university named after Sido and Kanhu is also not good
 is uniwarsity main 55 hazaar chaatro kaa bhavishya ujjwal hone kaa intazaar kar rahaa he
 There should be 476 assistant professors in this university but there are only 288
 188 pad rikt hai
 There should be 34 posts of a reader but not a single reader
 yahaan ke 13 mahavidhyalayon main se sirf ek ke paas principal hone kaa saubhaahgya praapt hai
 The remaining 12 colleges do not even have principals
 chaatr or chaatraon ko ek baat samaj aa gai he
 University means taking and passing the exam
 is series ke dauraan kai jagahon ke chaatro or profasaron ne phone par bataaya ki ek hi kaam he jo chal rahaa he
 To fill the examination form and get the examination done
 iske alaava sab kaam band hai
 In every college, the principal and the vc's room and office in the university will be found shining
 vahaan gamale zarur milenge
 Protecting the environment, ruining studies
 shikshak jaanate hai ki hakeekat kya he, isliye daawa bhi nahin kar pate hai
 This is true
 jab padhaane vaala hoga hi nahin to jo bachaa hua he wo kaise sara padhaa degaa
 We have seen the condition of two universities of Jharkhand
 ab uttari chotanagpur ke vinoba bhaave uniwarsity kaa haal bataate hue garv sa mahasoos ho rahaa he
 That our today's leaders have not left any leaders in the matter of remembrance
 jise bhi yaad kiya he unki nishaani dekhakar yaad ke naam se hi ruh kaanp uthati he
 Now, nothing should be made in anyone's memory
 is uniwarsity main bhi 70 pratishat shikshakon kii kami bataai ja rahi he
 This university is postponed due to the remaining 30 percent teachers
 chaatr shikaayat karte hai, shikaayat sun lee jaati he
 Even if there is no action in our country, a hearing takes place
 ab to bahut se log sunwaayee ko hi karrwai samaj kar apana dharna agle dharne tak ke liye sthagit kar dete hai
 The teachers who remain are also required to do the administration of the college
 padhai kaa kaam bhale hi ruk jaae, prashasan kaa kaam nahin ruknaa chahie
 The people of India sleep in the belief that governance is going on
 baaki aspataal, skool chale na chale, kya fark padataa he
 There is hope in the university that after 9 years, the exercise of reinstatement of professors is starting
 kisi ko pataa nahin ki kya 70 fisadi bahaali hogi, magar bahaali hone ja rahi he yahi sunakar ummiido ke badal chaa gaye hai
 The estimate of the professor's arrival has become like the estimate of the Meteorological Department
 bharat duniya kaa akelaa desh hoga jahaan nahin padhaane ke liye itane college khole gaye hai
 In this situation you are deceived by the annoyance of the name of rating that the rating has started in India like the world
 ab collejon kii ranking hogi
