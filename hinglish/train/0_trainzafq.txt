 On the historic ground at Lord's, host England managed to become world champions for the first time, but on Kistam's own
 isisi ke 'ajeeb niyam' ke chalate use kismat kaa saath mila
 Which has raised questions on the ICC rules
 england or newjiland ke bich vishwa cap ke final mukaable main 50-50 overon kaa match barabari par chuta or iske baad super over bhi taai ho gaya
 But later the win-loss decision was made on the basis of the maximum boundary during the match
 is paimaane par england newjiland par baari padaa
 Let's know, what is the rule made about super over, due to which New Zealand lost the World Cup to England
 bataa den ki toss jitkar pehle ballebaaji karte hue newjiland ne aath wicket par 241 ran banaae the
 In response, the entire England team went out to play on this score (241 runs) and the match was tied
 magar isisi ke niyam ne england ko vishwa champion bana diya
 Why is the Super Overgar match if the match is equal in the prescribed 50-50 overs, then the ICC has laid down the rules of Super Over for the result of the match
 nirdhaarit overs ke khel ke baad ek over kaa super over muqabla hota he
 If the match remains at par, then the team that declares the most boundary during its innings is declared the winner
 vishwa cap ke final mukaable main england ne 22 chauke or 2 chakke lagaae the, jabaki newjiland ne apni pari main 2 chakke or 14 chauke lagaae the
 England thus succeeded in winning
 ye he niyammatch ke parinaam ke liye jab super over kaa formula lagu hota he to match ke dauraan jo team baad main batting karti he to use pehle khilne kaa mauka miltaa he
 The win-loss is sustained on a six-ball match
 isamen do wicket girane par hi team kii pari khatm maani jaati he
 When the runs of both teams are equal even with a super over, then there is no second chance of a super over
 iske baad boundry ke aadhaar par hi kisi team kii jeet-haar kaa faisla hota he
 a round of rhetoric continues on Army Chief Bipin Rawat
 congress netaa or dilli kii purv mukhyamantri shila dikshit ke bete sandip dikshit ne sena pramukh ko 'sadak kaa gunda' kii sangya di he
 Dixit said that when our army chief speaks like a 'goon of the road', it sounds bad
 dikshit ke is bayaan ke baad bijepi ne unke khilaaf morcha khol diya
 Minister of State for Home Kiran Rijiju tweeted that what is happening with the Congress party? How can Congress call the army chief a goon of the road? haalanki bayaan dene ke thodi der baad hi sandip dikshit ne apane bayaan par maafee maang lee
 He said, 'I believe what i have said
 vah galat he, isliye maafee maangata hum or apana bayaan waapas letaa hum
 Congress leader Dixit said, "pakistan can do the same thing if it does the same kind of ulterior actions and make statements
" kharaab tab lagata he jab hamaare bhi thal senadhyaksh ek sadak ke gunde kii tarah bayaan dete hai
 If Pakistan gives, what is kept in their army
 wo sab to mafia tip ke log hai, lekin hamaare senadhyaksh is tarah ke bayaan kyon dete hai
 'he said, see, we have mildness, civilization, depth, strength
 hamaara desh duniya ke deshon main ek adarsh he
 And if we also do this kind of action, then it seems petty

 Therefore, people are urged not to tamper with the watermark window

 Significantly, BJP leader Yashwant Sinha recently said that if the government keeps sleeping on inflation and some serious steps are not taken, inflation can lead to violence in the country
 alvi ne kaha ki raajnneetik dalon ke is tarah ke bayaan prajatantr ko kamjor karte hai
 Strictly condemning the incident, BJP today said that the allegation of Congress is not justified that the incident happened due to bjp's statement
 loksabhaa main vipaksh kii netaa sushamaa swaraj ne kaha ki sharad pavaar ke saath ghati ghatana kii bhaajapa ninda karti he
 He said that Congress spokesperson Rashid Alvi's statement is far-fetched that violence took place on the statement of BJP leader Yashwant Sinha

 bandook chalaani nahin aati
 Do not know how to load pistol
 hathiyaaron ke naam to khayr koun yaad rakhe
 i do not remember when the expiry date of bullet and tear gas shells came out
 ab aise main aap upi police se kya ummid karegein? bas itnaa hi kah sakate hai ki sachmuch kamaal he yogi ji kii police
 Now, if someone does not mind, then let me also tell you that the UP Police is opening up the pole-band of so many of the police personnel
 darasal, upi police ke ek sahab ko laga ki chalo zaraa apni team kaa test le len
 Now what happens in that test is worth seeing
 yogi ji to kah rahe the ki uttar pradesh kii police ko aisa bana denge ki khud neuyork kaa police department aakar poochhega ki bhai karte kaise ho
 So now the curtain is going to be removed from this secret formula of UP Police
 kyonki ham ab aapako dikhaane ja rahe hai ki aakhir upi police karti kaise he
 First of all, have a glimpse of the training of Najibabad police station of Bijnor district of Western UP
 jahaan bijanour ke sio arun kumaar ne aane se kaaphi pehle ye kah diya tha ki wo nirikshan karne aa rahe hai
 The inspection started with these inspector of UP
 daroga ji ko pallate gan diya gaya or kaha chalie
 Hey, is this what you missed? sio saabah chilla uthe
 For a long time, the government has given this pellet to the gun station
 thane ke divaan sahab ne sambhaal kar bhi rakhi
 But na diwan means to sir
 naa inspector sahab se matlab
 Job is going on chalane dijie
 Thanedar drove, but what is that sir again saying Oh my God
 
 Then she missed
 magar ab aglaa fire kaise karen
 Where will the bullet take place
 koi to bataa do
 Sahab said to the Thanedar, now put the gun down
 goli change karo
 Standing there watching all this, Diwan Saheb was like a respect
 unhone thanedaar se bandook chhini or khud nishaanaa lagane lage
 But what did the divan shoot, but he got angry
 ab to nirikshan adhikari ne aakhirkaar kah hi diya, rahane do tumse naa ho paaegaa
 Now let's try another gun
 koi bolege nahin
 One sir is standing on his head
 upar se duusare saathiyon ke saamne beijjati bhi ho rahi he
 Come on, at least the Inspector will know how this gun works
 sahab ne poocha- bataaiye ise chalaate kaise hai
 And what is this gun called
 aaj to sardaar ji mushkil main funs gaye hai
 Because the Inspector has no answer to any question of the CO
 sahab ne jhallaakar poocha, pehla kaam kya karte hai
 Diwan Sahab is repeatedly trying to help Inspector Sahab
 magar sio sahab ne unhen chup kara diya
 After about 15 to 20 minutes of testing, it was decided that the inspector did not know how to fire a gun, nor did he know anything about it
 sahab ne apane staff se kaha "likhon in sabake bare main
 
 
 There is zero information
 " khayr ab inspector sahab kii jaankaree zero he
 So instead of inspecting the SO sir started giving information about weapons
 magar ye kya esao sahab ke samajhane or bataane ke baad bhi inspector sahab gan nahin chalaa paae
 In total, ashali and gunpowder, lying on a blanket, destroyed the conscience of these UP Police personnel
 sio sahab ko majaburi main kahana padaa- agar aap practice nahin karenge to barkhaast ho jaaenge
 It is not that the CO has come to inspect any special inspector at the police station
 balki unka ye ouchik nirikshan to police thane or pulisavaalon kii taiyaari ke liye tha
 So now it was the turn of general and practical knowledge of other policemen of the police station
 unhone thane ke usee inspector se poocha is asalhe kaa naam kya he
 Sir sir, Inspector sir does not even know the name of the gun
 to ye use chalaayenge kaise
 Even the Inspector, with a gun carrying a Tier Gas in his hands, could not tell what he was called
 sio sahab phir jhalla gaye or bole- chhod do nahin ho paaegaa tumse
 Now it was the turn of the second inspector of the police station
 jinke haath main aansu gas ke gole die gaye
 i was asked how the officer runs it
 to dekhie inspector sahab ne kya bataaya
 They said that they would run tear gas and sahib would lie down
 sio sahab ne sawaal daaga- aansu gas kaa gola chalaane ke baad aap let jaaenge? phir sio sahab ne sabaki class lagaai
 What is the level of UP Police personnel in general knowledge of weapons
 thane ke do darogaaon ko chhodkar duusare daroga to pistal or duusari riflon ko khol kar dobaaraa band bhi nahi kar paae
 Neither did he know the names of the weapons
 javaanon ke nirikshan ke baad sahab aage bade
 What was revealed when weapons were inspected
 pataa chalaa ki kai bandook or hathgole to chaar-chaar saal puraane hai
 The cartridges are damaged
 aansu gas ke gole bhi dhokhaa de gaye
 Now CO Arun Kumar was badly fussed and said - all these have expired
 darasal, ye daura tha bijanour ke ek sio arun kumaar kaa jo nazibabad thane pahunche the nirikshan karne
 Now think that if the soldiers are not ready to deal with an emergency in the police station and their weapons are of expiry date, then how events like Bulandshahar and Ghazipur happened then
 shaayad isi aadhi adhuri taiyaari kaa hi nateeja tha bulandshahr main inspector subodh kumaar kii maut
 And soldier Suresh Vats died in Ghazipur
 kul mila kar upi police ke thanon or javaanon main bas itani si dikkat he
 Everything else is fine

 23 saal tak pashchim bengal main bataur mukhyamantri kaam karne vaale basu ke bare main kabhi ye kaha jaataa tha ki ve bharat ke pradhanmantri ban sakate the
 Basu was born on 8 July 1914 in East Bengal (now Bangladesh)

 Then attended St

 Govind Ranade was a great nationalist, scholar, these things go well though Basu himself rejected this offer twice
 par 1996 main teesri baar unhen pradhanmantri banane kaa ofer mila
 This time he was ready to become Prime Minister
 unhone kaha tha ki agar party anumati degi to ve PM banenge
 But he was shocked when the party did not allow him to do it

 baad main jyoti basu ne kai intervyuu main naaraazgi bhi jataai thi or kaha tha ki party kaa ye faisla raajnneetik dwand kaa parinaam tha
 Later it was also said that many members of the CPI (M) Central Committee had already decided that Basu should be stopped from becoming Prime Minister
 khabaren aati raheen ki party ke is faisle se basu kaaphi dukhi rahaa karte the
 Let me tell you that before the 1989 Lok Sabha elections, Basu was offered to become Prime Minister
 ye ofer unhen chandrashekhar or arun nehru ne diya tha
 The second opportunity came in 1990 when the VP Singh government fell at the Center

 During this period, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal attacked PM Modi fiercely and said that Narendra Modi should speak on the Rafale aircraft agreement

 hamanen us dauraan rajdhani main bhrashtachar ko khatm kar diya gaya tha lekin modi ji ne hamaari sarkaar banane ke badenti karpshan branch ko kabje main liya
 PM Modi did not let the government of Delhi work

 Who dreams of invading Delhi today

 The PM of Pakistan also dreams of invading Kolkata

 If the PM of Pakistan had been in your place, we would have shown that the blood in us is still hot

 The Leader of Opposition is not a rhetorical post created to debate endlessly like lawyers
 sansadeey loktantr main yah check and balance ke liye jaruri he
 This is also necessary so that fairness, transparency and accountability are maintained through coordination of parties and opposition in the institutions
 bhartiya sansad kii loksabhaa main netaa pratipaksh kaa na hona koi asaadhaaran baat nahin he
 In 1969, a leader was recognized for the first time as Leader of the Opposition
 iske baad paanchavin (1971-77), saatvin (1980-84) or aathvin (1984-89) loksabhaa ke dauraan yah pad khaali hi rahaa
 However, a legal discussion about this began in 2014 when the speaker refused to give Congress the position of Leader of the Opposition
 2014 ke chunaav main congress loksabhaa main sabase badi vipakshi party thi, jiske paas kul 44 sadsy the
 The Congress was not authorized to be the Leader of the Opposition on the basis of not having at least 55 members in 545 i
e
 10% of the total seats of the Lok Sabha
 is baar satrahavin loksabhaa main congress ne ghoshnaa kar di he ki uske paas kul 52 sadsy hai jo 10 fisadi kii shart puri nahin karte, isliye vah netaa pratipaksh kaa pad nahin maangegi
 It is extremely important that before the formation of the next Lok Sabha, legal arguments are being presented in favor or opposition of the Leader of the Opposition
 netaa pratipaksh ke 10 pratishat kii shart kaise ai?2014 main congress ko netaa pratipaksh kaa pad dene ke bare main loksabhaa spikar ne centre sarkaar ke sarvocch kanoonee adhikari atarni general mukul rohtagi se salaah lee thi
 The advice given by Mukul Rohatgi on 23 July 2014 had three main points
 pehla, rohtagi ne 1956 main loksabhaa spikar ke nirdesh 120 or 121(1)(c) kaa hawala diya
 This directive states that if a party does not meet the quorum of having 10 per cent of the total members of the Lok Sabha, then the Speaker of the Lok Sabha is not bound to recognize the leader of the largest opposition party as the Leader of the Opposition
 haalanki, nirdesh 120 kahata he ki loksabhaa adhyaksh sadan kii prakriya ko sucharu rup se chalaane ke makasad se sadasyon ke ek association ko sansadeey dal yaa samooh ke rup main manyata de saktaa he or loksabhaa adhyaksh kaa nirnay antim hoga
 Directive 121 (1) (c) states that at least the prescribed quorum must be fulfilled to give recognition to the Parliamentary Party which constitutes 10 per cent of the total members of the House
 in nirdeshon main netaa pratipaksh kaa koi zikr nahin he, jabaki yah sansadeey dal yaa samooh kii manyata dene kii baat karata he
 What was the purpose of these directives of 1956
 Instruction 122 mentions 7 objectives: (a) Allotment of seats and blocks in the house (b) Allotment of rooms in Parliament House (c) Allotting committee room for party meeting (d) ) Supplying official documents (e) Nominating for parliamentary committees (f) Handing out a panel of names to the speaker for debate (g) Getting advice for moving the House or discussing any important points that come up in the House
 rohtagi kaa doosraa tark tha ki netaa pratipaksh kii manyata 'selleri and elounsej of leader of apojishan in parliament act, 1977' ke daayre main nahin aati he, jabaki netaa pratipaksh ke liye jo bhi naam saamne aata he, 'selleri and elounsej aaf leader aaf apojishan in parliament act, 1977' use sanvaidhanik manyata detaa he or yah pehali baar tha jab netaa pratipaksh pad ko kanoonee taur par vyakhyayit kiya gaya
 Section 2 of the law says that the speaker who will be the largest party in opposition in the lower house i
e
 Lok Sabha, will recognize its leader as the leader of the opposition, but there is no mention of the condition of having at least 10 percent of the members, on the basis of which Leader of the Opposition should be elected
 haalanki, rohtagi kaa tark he ki 1977 ke vidheyak ke paas hone ke baad bhi saatvin loksabhaa main netaa pratipaksh kaa pad khaali hi rahaa
 In 1956, the Speaker's directive to the Leader of the Opposition remained effective
 2005 se 2010 tak loksabhaa ke mahasachiv rahe pediti acharya kaa vichaar alag he
 He says that after the coming of 'salary and Alliances of Leaders of Opposition in Parliament Act, 1977', the post of Leader of Opposition got constitutional status and it was established
 is vidheyak ke paas hone ke baad 1956 kaa spikar kaa nirdesh apraasangik ho gaya
 After the 10th Schedule came into effect in 1985 (anti-defection Law), importance is given to every opposition party irrespective of the member numbers
 10veen anusuchee ne spikar ke nirdesh 120 ko apraasangik bana diya
 However, Subhash Kashyap, who was the General Secretary of Lok Sabha from 1984-1990, prefers the 1956 Speaker's instruction
 ve kehete hai ki 1977 kaa act yaa koi doosraa kanoon yah nahin kahata he ki spikar kaa nirdesh avaidhanik he, lekin ve yah bhi kehete hai ki spikar ko netaa pratipaksh kii manyata deni chahie, kyonki yah ek jimmedaari kaa pad he or swasth loktantr ke liye jaruri he ki majboot sarkaar ke khilaaf ek sthaayee vipaksh bhi ho
 Rohatgi's third argument was about the presence of the Leader of Opposition in the selection committees formed under the CVC Act, RTI Act, Lokpal and Lokayukta Act and Human Rights Act
 unhone kaha ki sivisi act or artiai act main loksabhaa ke netaa pratipaksh ke vikalp ke rup main sabase badi party ke netaa kaa praavdhaan kiya gaya he
 These four laws also provide that even if a post is vacant in the selection committee, the selection made by it will not be illegal, so Rohatgi denied the statutory requirement of the Leader of Opposition
 aage kya ho?yah myne nahin rakhata ki kanoonee bahes koun jeet rahaa he
 The Leader of Opposition has its own importance for effective opposition in Parliament
 iske alaava sivisi, sibiai, siaisi, lokapal jaisi javabdeh sansthaaon kii niyuktiyon main nishpakshta or paardarshita banaae rakhane ke liye bhi netaa pratipaksh kaa hona behad jaruri he
 Nor should it be exaggerated, nor should it be viewed inferiorly
 yah mahatv nahin rakhata ki kanoon main kitna jhol yaa kitni aspashtataa he, jaisaa ki rohtagi ne pesh kii thi
 The PDT Acharya cites the Westminster model that India is following
 isamen vipaksh apni swatantra satta hoti he or netaa pratipaksh ko 'pradhanmantri kii pratichaaya' kaha jaataa he jo ki sarkaar girane kii haalat main charge lene ke liye taiyaar rahata he
 Apart from this, the job of the Leader of Opposition in formulating policies and legislative work in the House is to unite the opposition and to keep it effective
 ve kehete hai ki netaa pratipaksh ko manyata dene ke liye ab sansad se paas kiya gaya kanoon maujuud he, ise lagu kiya janaa chahie
 Acharya also cites that exemplary example of the Delhi Legislative Assembly when in 2015 the BJP got just 3 seats out of 70
 phir bhi spikar ram nivas goyal ne bijepi netaa vijender gupta ko netaa pratipaksh kaa darja diya

 ) Union Minister Ananth Kumar Hegde has written a letter to the Chief Secretary of Karnataka, asking Tipu Sultan not to be invited to the events related to Tipu Jayanti to be held in the state, calling it anti-hindu and barbaric killer
 karnataka sarkaar ne ghoshnaa kii he ki har saal 10 november ko tipu jayanti kaa aayojan kiya jayega

 patr main kaha gaya he ki is baat ko tipu jayanti manaa rahe rajya ke sabhi vibhaagon ke dhyaan main laayaa janaa chahie
 Hegde has further stated that he condemns Tipu Jayanti to be celebrated in the state, as Tipu was anti-hindu
 usne mysore or kurg main hajaaron kii barbar tareeke se hatya karvaa di thi
 Keep in mind that Hegde has an old connection with controversies and has been making stern comments about Hindutva
 isse pehle unka ek video saamne aayaa tha, jisamen vah uttar kannada ke ek aspataal main doctor ko peetate hue dikhaai dete hai
 Significantly, the issue of being 'anti-hindu' remains a matter of debate across the country
 uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne haal hi main tajmahal ko upi ke paryaton sthalon kii suchi se baahar kar diya tha
 Reacting to this, up's BJP leader and MLA Sangeet Som called the Mughals 'traitors'

 Businessmen across the country are loudly registering their opposition to GST
 rajdhani ke furniture vyapaaree bhi hadtaal par hai, jiske chalate keval dilli main hi ab tak karodon ke nuksaan kaa anumaan he
 Earlier, there was a tax of 12 per cent on the purchase of furniture, which has been increased to 28 per cent
 ab furniture ke chote-bade shorums ke maalikon ke saath-saath furniture banane vaale chote se chote factory maalik bhi tex ke daayre main aa jaaenge, jinako abhi tak tex ke naam par ek paisa nahin dena padataa tha
 Along with the implementation of GST, any kind of furniture will fall in the category of luxury items
 isi ke chalate us par lagane vaala tex 28 pratishat kar diya gaya he yani agar ab aap koi furniture kharidne kii soch rahe hai to aapako zyada paise chukaane padenge
 Rattinder Bhatia, president of the furniture trade association, says, 'we are not opposed to GST, we are angry with furniture category as a luxury item, furniture is not a luxury for any house and take 28 percent tax on it Is not justified anywhere 'kirti nagar ke furniture kaarobaariyon kaa haldesh bhar kefurniture udyog kaa sabase bada hissaa choti factriyaan hai, jahaan home decoration se jude har tarah ke furniture banaae jate hai
 Big showrooms here buy furniture at arbitrary prices
 pehle kisi bhi tex slab kaa hissaa nahin the kyonki inaki aamadani zyada nahin hoti, par ab inako bhi 28 fisadi kar chukaana hoga
 Shyam Lal, the owner of a small furniture factory in Kirti Nagar, says, 'we will be ruined, we trusted Modi ji but he is taking away our livelihood from us, we should pay tax to pay the landlord's rent that the workers Wages, we are wasted

 " bharat main pradooshan badi samasya banataa ja rahaa he, lekin loksabhaa chunaav ke mudde se yah ekadam gaayab he
 In all areas of North India, due to burning of stubble, air pollution reaches dangerous levels, but it is not an issue for the leaders nor for the common man in the Lok Sabha elections
 chunaav ke dauraan isaki charchaa tak nahin kii ja rahi he
 At the same time, environmentalists say that today air pollution and water pollution is a major problem, but the awareness of it has not yet reached the level of common people to make it an electoral issue

 Kundan Kumar, a resident of Delhi, says that when people have nothing to do with the river, how can people have love for it? According to renowned environmentalist and in-charge Fayaz Khudsar of Yamuna Biodiversity Park, it is indeed unfortunate that this time no political party has given prominence to environmental issues in its manifesto
 unka maananaa he ki logon ko saaf hawa or pani se bhari hui nadi ko ab chunaav kaa mudda bananaa chahie, lekin is baar aisa nahin hua
 He believes that there is a need for more awareness among people about air and water pollution
 hamaare jaise paryaavaranvid aam logon ke bich paryaavaran ke mahatv ko bataane main kahin naa kahin naakaam rahe hai
 According to well-known environmentalist Vilas Gokte, there is a concern among the general public about the environment, but it has become an election issue, so much awareness has not come to the public
 unka kahana he ki vaayu pradooshan se log prabhavit ho rahe hai or nadiyaan puri tareeke se khatm ho rahi hai
 Due to this our existence is also in danger

 He also held separate talks with the outgoing Shankaracharya Swami Satyamitrananda Maharaj and sought his support and support for the party
 haridwar kii donon pramukh sansthaaon ke desh bhar main karodon anuyaayi hai
 Considered close to the Vishwa Hindu Parishad and the BJP, the Bharatiya Mata temple's saint Satyamitrananda also has widespread influence across the country and especially in Gujarat
 donon aadhyatmik sanghathanon ke pramukhon se mulaakaat ke bare main bijepi adhyaksh shah ne kuch nahin kaha, jabaki party ne ise shishtachar bhent bataaya
 However, after the meeting, Shantikunj chief Pandya praised the good governance of the Modi government and said that Shantikunj would discharge his role in bringing some public interest schemes of the central government to the people
 ek sawaal ke jawaab main unhone saaf kiya ki shaantikunj bijepi ke paksh main sidhe-sidhe samarthan yaa vot dene kii ghoshnaa nahin karegaa
 On the question of the difference between the 'namami Gange' scheme under the Ganga Cleanliness Campaign of the Central Government and the Ganga Cleanliness Campaign of Shantikunj, he said that Shantikunj worked more effectively than Namami Gange through public awareness
 bhartiya vishvavidhyalayon kii asahmati or vichaar-vimarsh kii samskruti gambhir chunauti se jujh rahi he, kyonki narendra modi sarkaar sarkari or nijee vishvavidhyalayon ke orientation or paathyakramon ko suniyojit tareeke se prabhavit karne kii koshish kar rahi he, taaki bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) or sangh parivaar kii hindu rashtrawaad kii vichaardhaara ko inamen samyojit kiya ja sake
 Government intervention in universities is not new, this trend has increased in the last 25 years, but the kind of interference we are seeing today is not seen before
 yah ab aise charan main pahunch gaya he, jahaan sarkari vishvavidhyalayon kii academik swaittata khatm ho sakati he
 The Modi government's plan is clear: long-term changes in programs and priorities lead to drastic changes in education, and to place people in important positions that will be useful in the future
 iske liye vah sarkaar or sangh ke vafaadaaron ko kendriya or rajyon ke vishvavidhyalayon, research, technology or saanskrithik sansthaaon main mahatvapurn padon par tainaat kar rahi he
 This is not the first time any power is appointing its favorite people in positions of strength and influence
 lekin pehle kam se kam sansthaanon ke pramukhon yaa academik nikaayon ke sadasyon main ek peshewar yogyata to dikhti thi, lekin is maamle main to maujuuda satta ke samarthit zyaadaatar logon kaa record bahut hi niraashajanak he
 Such people have little expertise or achievement even to show
 is maamle main kisi bhi tarah kii aalochana ko raajnneeti prerit bataakar khaarij kar diya jaataa he
 This counter argument cannot be accepted, as the government is choosing Hindu nationalists whose academic record has been dubious for key positions in educational institutions and universities
 america main rahane vaale hindutv vichaarak rajeev malhotra ko jawaharlal nehru uniwarsity ke centre for media studies main honorari faikalti niyukt karnaa iskaa ek acha udhaaharan he

 He tweeted on November 1 explaining why he retreated: "A biographer of Gandhi cannot teach in Gandhi's city for a course on Gandhi
 '' iske do din baad hi khabar ai ki nehru memorial mujium and librari (enemmal) socity ke kam se kam teen asahmati vaale sadasyon ko sarkaar ne hataa diya he, jinhone teen murti parisar main sabhi pradhanmantriyon ke liye sangrahalay banane ke nirnay kaa virodh kiya tha or tivi anker arnab goswami sahit chaar aise sadasyon ko niyukt kiya gaya jo sarkaar ke kadamon ke khilaaf na jaaen
 The reasons for these appointments and the exclusion of people are the same: the space for disagreement is steadily decreasing and the Sangh loyalists are being given considerable priority
 ramchandra guha ke maamle ko hi dekhen to akhil bhartiya vidhyaarthee parishad (abivipi) ne unhen "raashtra virdohi'' bataate hue unki niyukti par aapatti jataai thi
 This went against him and the university administration kept silence in this matter
 yah jeenyu se lekar eyu tak vibhinn vishvavidhyalayon main chal rahi ek maanak ban gai prakriya ke anuroop he
 On the other hand, due to change in NMML society membership, the ruling party wants to increase its political dominance

 angreji akhbaar 'indian express' ke mutabiq is maamle par pichley maheene supreme court main states report dene se pehle sibiai ne kanoon mantri ashvini kumaar or pradhanmantri karyaalay ke saath baithken kii thim
 According to the newspaper, in the meeting of senior CBI officials with the law minister, several amendments were suggested in this report and the CBI accepted them
 akhbaar ke anusaar is baithak main sibiai ke nideshak ranjit sinha bhi maujuud the
 The BJP has reacted sharply to this
 loksabhaa main vipaksh kii netaa sushamaa swaraj ne twitor par kaha ki ye gambhir maamla he or pradhanmantri ko bachaane ke liye sibiai par dabaav daalane kaa saboot he
 Leader of the Opposition in Rajya Sabha Arun Jaitley has also sought clarification from the government in this matter and has asked the Special Investigation Team (SIT) to investigate the scam
 jetali ne kaha, upie ek 'dusht' sarkaar he, jo sibiai ko swatantra rup se kaam nahin karne degi
 The comments enditivi ne jab is report ke bare main sibiai nideshak se poocha to unhone koi tippanee karne se inkaar kar diya
 The PMO also refused to respond, stating that the matter is sub judice
 is maamle main sibiai ke purv nideshak joginder singh kaa kahana he ki sibiai sarkaar kaa ek mantralay he or koi bhi sarkaar ise nishpaksh tareeke se kaam nahin karne detaa
 At the same time, Congress says that BJP has become used to mislead the country

 According to the newspaper, CBI Director Ranjit Sinha was also present in this meeting

 dilli se 150 kimi dur uttar pradesh kaa gaanv nagala fatela modi sarkaar kii nai kirakiri he
 Referring to the success of a year-old campaign to bring electricity to the villages, the Prime Minister announced from the Red Fort that electricity has reached the village after seventy years
 bhaashan ko saat ghante bhi nahin beete the ki sarkaar ko pataa chalaa ki daawa galat he, kyonki gaanv main ab tak andhera he
 After this the round of withdrawal of tweets and calling of the Uttar Pradesh government started
 skiimon ko labhaarthi tak pahunchane kii chunauti bhartiya gavarnence kii buniyadi uljhan he
 Nagla Phatela is its newest representative
 modi sarkaar ke saath yah uljhan zyada bad gai he kyonki nai mahatvakankshi scimen banane se pehle puraane tajurbon se kuch nahin siikhaa gaya
 On the other hand, publicity became so intense that Nagla Phatela started appearing in many places
 scimen banane main hamaare netaa laasaani hai
 Good schemes were made earlier and also made by this government
 skiimon kii duusari manzil sansaadhan jutaney, samanvay (centre, rajya or sarkari vibhaagon se) or lakshya tay karne kii he
 The scheme gets the last floor after reaching the beneficiary
 sarkaar kii kai scimen duusari manzil bhi paar kar nahin kar pai hai, jabaki madhyavadhi lag chuki he
 Three major schemes can be examined in the context of Nagla Fatela, who is a victim of the Last Mile Challenge
 november, 2015 main jab sarkaar ne sarvice tex par 0
 5% cess was imposed, by then a year had passed for the cleanliness drive and the targets of the scheme, method of implementation and resources were not decided
 safai kaa mishan nagaron va gaanvon main sampurna swatchta kii ummid jagaata tha, lekin ek saal ke bheetar hi ise upie sarkaar ke nirmal gram kii tarj par gaanvon main shauchalay banane or khule main shouch ko samaapt karne par simit kar diya gaya
 Due to the new taxation, resources started coming, but the campaign did not gain momentum
 shaharon kii safai antat: nagar nikaayon ko kerani he jinke paas sansaadhan nahin hai
 If the resources started going to the municipal corporations, then the cleaning wheel could spin in the cities
 gaanvon main shauchalay banaate samay yah nahin dekha gaya ki pani kii aapurti or mel nistaaran kaa intjaam kaise hoga
 The arrangement of resources for both these basic needs was not included in the scheme
 isliye gaanvon main bane shauchalay istemaal ke laayak nahin ho sake
 The latest situation is that despite government resolutions, schemes, departments and new taxes, the city and the village are as dirty as ever
 doosraa udhaaharan diarect benifit transfar (labhaarthiyon tak sidhe sabsidi) skim kaa he
 The scheme did not have a resource challenge as subsidies were already being distributed
 alabatta alpiji sabsidi baantne main mili safalataa ke baad skim thithak-si gai
 Actually, the LPG subsidy was universal, that is to be received by all
 kerosine yaa duusari sabsidi skiimon kii tarah, isamen labhaarthiyon ko pahchaanane kii chunauti nahin thi
 dbt's journey slowed after LPG
 kerosine va khaadya sabsidi kii debiti scimen sakriy nahin ho sakin
 Subsidy schemes are run by different ministries
 isamen rajya sarkaron kii bhoomika bhi mahatvapurn he
 This overall coordination is the second floor of DBT
 alpiji main yah kaam aasaani se ho gaya kyonki petroleum mantralay, tel companiyon or kuch sau gas agenciyon ko yah skim lagu kerani thi
 In the case of other schemes, this is not so easy
 labhaarthiyon kii pahchaan is skim kii aakhri manzil he, jiskaa paimaana abhi tak tay nahin he
 Efforts to connect MNREGA with DBT could not be accelerated as the coordination between the states and the center could not be achieved
 debiti ke liye sarkaar ke paas sansaadhan hai
 There are also experiences of successes, but due to the challenges of coordination and implementation, the destination has not been found
 saansad adarsh gram yojana bharat main gramin vikaas kii sabase krantikari pahal ho sakati thi kyonki pehali baar kisi sarkaar ne chune hue sarvocch pratinidhi ko loktantr kii sabase nichali ikai yani panchayat se joda tha
 This scheme could have been miraculous when linked to MP fund
 lekin yojana ke lakshya aspasht the
 Dozens of central and state schemes run in the villages that were not coordinated, so far from the government department, the mps also showed no interest in adopting the villages and a major initiative died in the middle
 cabinet main taaje pherbadal se pehle pradhanmantri ne kaha tha ki mere liye safalataa kaa arth yah he ki log badlaav mahasoos karen
 If i have to claim achievements, i would not consider it a success
 haalanki pradhanmantri ko khud, laal kile ke marathon bhaashan main rah-rahakar daawey karne pade
 The Prime Minister's speech on Independence Day was showing his uneasiness that the government has crossed half way, but the effects of the schemes are not visible
 acha he ki pradhanmantri baichaiyn hai, congress kii tarah hakeekat se gaffil nahin
 The restlessness of politicians is good especially when the government realizes the reality
 dhai saal puure kar rahi modi sarkaar ko ab kriyanvayan kii chunauti se do-do haath karne chahie, jo uske achche-achche iraadon ko patari se utaar rahi he
 The government has to come out of the multitude of schemes and select programs and deliver them to the results so that change can be felt
 pradhanmantri ke paas ab nagala fatela jaise tajurbon kii koi kami nahin he
 He must have understood the risk of playing expectations as of now
 unki hode ab vakt ke saath he, jiske guzarane kii raftaar par unka koi kaabo nahin he
 Galaxy Note 8 may launch
 Galaxy Note 7 kaa kya hashr hua tha yah aapako pataa hi hoga
 But now Samsung's Mobile Chief DJ Ko has announced that the company will launch the flagship smartphone in the mid of this year
 company kii taraf se jari kiye gaye statement se saaf he ki company Note 7 ke flop hone ke baad rukna nahin chaahati balki pehle kii tarah ise samay se launch karne kii taiyaari main he
 After continuous battery bursting of Note 7, the company finished its production and sales forever
 iske alaava reports yah bhi ai ki shaayad company is siries ko khatm kar sakati he

 isliye is saal ke mid main ek nae flagship kaa matlab kya he
 According to reports, the new flagship smartphone will be launched in mid-2017
 gauratlab he ki company note siries ke fablet isi vakt launch karti he
 That is, it is clear from the company's statement that the company is probably preparing to bring the Note 8
 kyonki Note 5 agast 2015 main launch hua, jabaki Note 7 ko bhi pichley saal agast main hi launch kiya gaya tha
 Recently launched Galaxy S7 and S7 + are getting good response worldwide
 isaki pre booking bhi kaaphi ho rahi he or ye smartfones lagbhag sabi department main damdaar hai
 Last month, Samsung made it clear that the company would replace the old Note 7 battery and sell its refurbished variant
 reports ke mutabik isaki bikri south korea main june se shuru hogi

 mukesh ambani ke 'jeeyo' sim kaa cheharaa ab bollywood ke badshaah shahrukh khan ban gaye hai
 There is no doubt that Shahrukh is the king of the ad world as well as the big screen
 shahrukh kaa edwartisment main aane kaa silsilaa superstar banane se pehle hi shuru ho gaya tha
 In the 90s, Shah Rukh appeared in the advertisement of 'hero Motorbike' and with his presence, he told everyone that he has come to establish his foothold in this industry
 shahrukh ne 24 saal ke abhi tak ke filmi kariyar main dheron aids kiye hai, jisamen 'cinthol' or 'di'debor' ke aid main wo apni patnigaurike saath bhi dikh chuke hai
 Shahrukh will be seen together with these 4 Bollywood actresses, most of them are seen in the commercial of Shahrukh 'pepsi'
 kuch saal pehle aayaa unka pepsy kaa 'oe bubbly
 
 
 'so people had climbed their tongues
 saath hi bollywood kii glamras heroinon se ghire hue bathtub main baithe shahrukh ke 'lucks' ke aid ne to dhooma hi machaa di thi
 Hopefully! Shahrukh Khan Shahrukh also became the brand ambassador of 'nokia' in these films and as long as Nokia remained No
1 in India, Shah Rukh remained his face
 iske alaava king khan 'airtel', 'videokon', 'dish tivi' ke aids main bhi dhamal machaa chuke hai
 Talking about cosmetics, he has also promoted 'fair and Handsome', 'emami', 'navratna Talk' and Tel
 salmaan nahin shahrukh khan banenge 'dhooma 4' ke villen?iske alaawashahrukhane 'nerolac paint', 'pepsodent', 'hundai', 'royal stag', 'panvilas', 'sona-chaandi chvayanprash', 'isiaisiai bank', 'sunfist' jaise brands ko bhi andorse kiya he
 There is no doubt that whatever brand Shahrukh becomes the face of, he becomes number 1
 shahrukh kaa matlab hi he brand kaa hit hona
 Shahrukh's cuteness and strong dialogue delivery attracts the audience and perhaps that is why even at the age of 50, Shah Rukh remains his first choice

 Ever since Aam Aadmi Party MP Bhagwant Mann has uploaded videos of all security points on his Facebook from the gate of Parliament to inside the Parliament House, all his parties not only his party mps against him in Parliament Front opened
 sab ne kaha kii maan ne sansad kii suraksha ke saath khilwaad kiya he or iske liye spikar ko unke khilaaf karrwai kerani chahie
 On the other hand, Hirendra Singh Khalsa, a sacked MP of his party, who has a Division Number 495, met the Lok Sabha Speaker and made a new complaint to Bhagwant Mann
 unhone shikaayat main kaha ki unki seat ko badal diya jaye kyonki unki bagal vaali seat par baithne vaale bhagwant maan sansad mensharab pikar aate hanore unke munh se sharaab kii badboo bhi aati he
 It is clear that Bhagwant Mann's day-to-day trouble is increasing instead of decreasing
 sadsyta radd karne kii maajkali dal or bijepi ke saansadon ne loksabhaa spikar se milakar bhagwant maan kii sansad sadsyta ko radd karne kii maang kar di
 Speaker Sumitra Mahajan also summoned Bhagwant Mann, after which Bhagwant Mann admitted his apology to the speaker, but the speaker only said after listening to his side that he would talk to all the parties only on this matter
 But will take a decision
 maafee ke laayak nahin he maanaaj bhagwant maan ko lekar sansad ke donon sadanon main kaaphi hangaamaa hua or sabhi partiyon ke saansadon ne is maamle main ek hi sur main kaha ki bhagwant maan kii ye galati maaf karne laayak nahin he
 Some members made a suggestion that a committee of mps should be formed on this matter, which should decide what action should be taken against Bhagwant Mann
 bhagwant maan ne jo galati kii he us par unke khilaaf kya karrwai kii jaae iskaa faisla loksabhaa spikar sumitra mahajan ko sansad kii suraksha ko dhyaan main rakhte hue karnaa he
 But in view of the Punjab election, the Akali Dal and BJP as well as the Congress are blaming the Aam Aadmi Party and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal for this mistake of Bhagwant Mann
 ye bhi sach he punjab chunaav se pehle bhagwant maan ne party ke liye badi musiibat khadi kar di he jiskaa nuksaan aam aadmi party ko punjab chunaav main uthanaa padegaa

 bjp's national council meeting continues at Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium
 baithak main modi ke alaava adwani, rajnath, jetali, amit shah sahit tamaam bade netaa maujuud hai
 This is the first meeting of the BJP National Council after Narendra Modi became Prime Minister
 isamen bataur bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ke naam par muhar lagi
 Former BJP president Rajnath Singh approved the name of Amit Shah, which was approved by the National Council of BJP
 rajnath singh ne apane sambodhan main kaha ki amit shah ko party kii kaman saunpna uchit faisla he
 Shah led the party to great success in UP
 rashtriya parishad kii baithak ke liye dilli main joardaar taiyaari kii gai he
 Grand arrangements have been made at the Nehru Stadium for the meeting
 bijepi ne puure stadium ko bhagava rang main rang diya he
 The stadium has photographs of Modi and Amit Shah
 stadium main atal, adwani, rajnath, jetali, sushamaa kii bhi tasviren hai modi or amit shah chhaae hue hai
 The BJP National Council meeting started at 11 am
 deep jalaane ke baad sabase pehle dilli bijepi adhyaksh satish upaadhyaay pratinidhiyon kaa swaagat kiya
 After the seal of the council, Amit Shah will deliver the presidential address
 unke bhaashan main sanghathan par jor rahegaa
 Amit Shah will give directions for the upcoming assembly elections and instill enthusiasm among the workers
 parishad kii baithak main bijepi kaa prastaav bhi paarit hoga
 The proposal presented by Arun Jaitley will have the accounts of the government
 prastaav main jetali daawa karenge ki raashtrapati abhibhaashan ke sabhi vaadon ko modi sarkaar ne pehle bajet main puraa kiya
 Hitech Forum for Modi is a high-tech platform built for PM Modi
 is par thri di takanic kaa bhi istemaal hoga
 The stage also has two large video screens
 haul main kareeb 2500 pratinidhiyon ke baithne kaa intjaam he
 Amit Shah and PM Modi will appear on stage together
 modi or shah kii jodi ko saath dekhne ke liye bijepi kaaryakarta betaab hai
 In the council meeting, senior party leader LK Advani will give guidance and show the benefits of strong organization

 According to BJP sources, the entire event will cost around one crore rupees
 party kii koshish dilli ko modimay banaakar ek baar phir bijepi kaaryakartaaon main utsaah bharne kii he
 US Secretary of State John Kerry may never forget his first rain in India
 buudhvaar subah jhamajham barish se rashtriya rajdhani dilli kaa haal behaal he
 Roads have become pond
 yahi kaaran he ki kerri jab subah iaiti-dilli ke chaatro ko sambodhit karne pahunche to bheed dekhakar dang rah gaye
 He wondered how such a large number of students went to meet him in such a season
 lage haath unhone tippanee bhi kii- kya aap log naav se yahaan aae hai
 
 
 Surely, this comment of Perkerei was taken as a joke from all over social media
 haalanki yah bahut sambhav he ki unhone aisa apane bhaashan kii shuruyaat se pehle maahaul ko khushnuma banane ke liye kaha ho
 However, even after the death of Moumus, the people of Delhi did not need a boat, but for John Kerry, it would be an information that many of the best cities of the world were so badly rained that the boats actually started moving there
 dilli main baari barish ke kaaran abhi tak naav chalaane kii naubat nahin ai, jabaki is vajah se america ke louiciana, britain ke landan or paris main barish kii vajah se sadak par naav tair chuki he
 In the same month in Louisiana, 20,000 people were evacuated from the waterlogged areas by boat after the rain
 barish ke kaaran louiciana shahar main 24 ghante ke liye tagada jam laga so alag
 Interestingly, John Kerry has been a traffic jam twice during his recent visit to Delhi
 bahut sambhav he ki isi kaaran unhone halaat ko dekhte hue iaiti main aisa bayaan diya

 Shia Waqf Board President Wasim Rizvi has given a controversial statement regarding Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi
 wasim rizvi ne kaha ki 'agar priyanka gandhi pehle market main aa jaatin to main apni film main unhen heroin bana detaa
 This statement of Wasim Rizvi has increased the electoral movement because as the elections are approaching, the controversial statements of the leaders are becoming electoral headlines
 wasim rizvi ne kaha, 'hamane kaha he ki priyanka gandhi kaaphi sundar hai
 We have also said that when she has come in the market, in the field of politics, if she had come soon, we would have offered her the role of Zafar Khan's daughter-in-law because she is beautiful and deserves to be a heroine
 'us samay agar vah market main aa jaatin to ek muslim ladki jafar khan kii bahu kaa role tha jo naazaneen patni ne kiya tha
 At that time we were looking for a Muslim girl and Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi are Muslims
 'shiya vakf board adhyaksh wasim rizvi ne aage kaha, 'meri najar main ve sundar ladi hai or kisi kii khubsuurati kii tarif karnaa bura nahin he
 If we came to the market when we were shooting our film, it was the role of a Muslim girl, Zafar Khan's daughter-in-law, which was done by Nazneen Patni
 us samay ham ek muslim ladki dhund rahe the or rahul gandhi or priyanka gandhi musalmaan hai
 'let me tell you that Priyanka Gandhi's brother and Congress President Rahul Gandhi is contesting from Amethi
 muqabla bijepi kii smriti irani se he
 Priyanka also understands this challenge very well, so gave the Congress booth workers the mantra of victory in a closed-room address
 priyanka gandhi ne apane sambodhan main kaha ki 'aap logon ne har baar apane parivaar ko chunaa he, is baar bhi aap apane parivaar ko chunie
 Like every time in the election, i will not be able to go to one block in a day
 ab rahul ne mujhe nai jimmedaari de di he
 i have to go all over the country to campaign
 isliye amethi main kam samay de paaungi
 You fight these elections, i have full faith in you, this time also you have to fight with more strength and Rahul has to win
 congress mahasachiv priyanka gandhi wadra philhal amethi ke daure par hai
 He encouraged the party workers on Wednesday by saying that this time only Rahul Bhaiya will also become MP and PM
 haalanki chunaavon main priyanka gandhi ke asar ko khud unki chachee menka gandhi ne asardaar maanane se inkaar kar diya he
 Priyanka Gandhi had been campaigning in the seats of Amethi and Rae Bareli before being made the general secretary, but this time Rahul Gandhi handed over the work of eastern Uttar Pradesh

 kaveri jal vivaad par supreme court ne apana faisla suna diya he
 In view of this, security arrangements had already been tightened in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu
 kaveri jal vivaad tribunel ne is masale par 5 farvari ko apana antim aadesh diya tha, jise karnataka or tamilnadu donon rajyon ne supreme court main chunauti di thi
 Kaveri is also called Ganga of South India
 yah pashchimi ghat ke parvat brahmagiri se nikali he
 Its length is about 800 kilometers
 kaveri nadi ke delta par acchhee kheti hoti he
 There is a dispute between the two states regarding its water
 supreme court ne kaaphi lambii sunwaayee ke baad pichley saal 20 sitambar ko apana faisla surakshit rakh liya tha
 This is a very emotional issue for millions of families dependent on the waters of this river in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu
 aaie 10 binduon main jaanate hai ki aakhir kya he yah vivaad
 
 
 1
 kaveri nadi jal ke vitaran or istemaal par karnataka or tamilnadu ke ilaake ke logon ke bich kareeb 137 saal se vivaad chal rahaa he
 The dispute first arose in 1881 when the erstwhile Mysore state decided to build a dam on the Kaveri
 tatkaaleen madras rajya ne is par aapatti kii
 After the mediation of the British people, an agreement was reached on this in 1924, after many years
 lekin vivaad aazaadee ke pehle or aazaadee ke baad bhi jari rahaa
 2
 saal 1990 main kaveri jal vivaad tribunel (CWDT) kii sthapana hui
 In 2007, the tribunal placed its order on it
 lekin supreme court ke aadesh ke baad hi saal 2013 main centre sarkaar ne is aadesh se sambandhit adhisuchana jari kii
 3
 kaveri nadi ke jal par chaar rajyon ke karodon log nirbhar hai
 The tribunal, in its order, allocated 419 teamac feet to Tamil Nadu, 270 teamac feet to Karnataka, 30 TMC feet to Kerala (a tributary of Kaveri passes through the state) and 7 TMC feet to Puducherry
 4
 The Cauvery Tribunal, based on 100 years of average water availability in the river, estimated that even if half of its water is available for use, 740 feet of TMC water can be found
 tribnunal ne karnataka ko aadesh diya ki use june se lekar may tak har saal 192 tiemasi foot pani chhodana hoga
 5
 tribunel ne kaha ki kharaab monsoon vaale saal main sabhi rajyon ko isi anupaat main jal main kami ko saajha karnaa hoga
 But this provision further increased the dispute between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu
 6
 In the last few years, due to erratic monsoon and huge water crisis in Bengaluru, Karnataka has been repeatedly saying that it does not have enough water in the Cauvery river basin to give Tamil Nadu its share
 7
 On the other hand, Tamil Nadu was also not happy with the Cauvery tribunal's order
 agast 2016 main tamilnadu supreme court kii sharan main chalaa gaya, yah daawa karte hue ki tribunel kaa aadesh galat he, kyonki usne sirf fasal ke mausam kaa dhyaan rakhaa he
 8
 tamilnadu kaa tark he ki rajya ke kisaan saal main do fasal bote hai, isliye unhen karnataka ke mukaable zyada pani milanaa chahie
 Tamil Nadu also argues that they need more water than the allocation of tribunals, as Samba paddy is cultivated in the state, which requires more water
 9
 Following this move by the Tamil Nadu government, Karnataka also immediately moved the Supreme Court and demanded additional water for the state
 karnataka ne kaha ki monsoon main utaar-chadhaav aurakam barish kiwajah se uske liye yah sambhav nahin he ki tribnul dwaara tamilnadu ke liye tay aavanton se zyada pani chhod sake
 10
 sitambar 2016 main supreme court ne karnataka ko aadesh diya ki vah agle 10 dinon ke liye har dinatamilnadu cocaveri nadi kaa 15,000 kusek pani de
 Following this order of the Supreme Court, large-scale violent demonstrations started in entire Karnataka

 Upendra Kushwaha, a minister in the Modi government, was also preparing to shock the BJP, but before that there has been a split in his Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP)
 RLSP saansad arun kumaar aaj kushvaha se alag hokar apni nai party banane kii ghoshnaa kar sakate hai
 Before the Lok Sabha elections, another political explosion in Bihar is going to be done by Arun Kumar, RLSP MP from Jehanabad
 patna ke esake memorial haal main ek bade kaarykram main nai party ke gathan kaa aupchaarik elaan kiya jayega
 According to the sources, both the name and the organization of Arun Kumar's party has been prepared
 nai party kaa naam rashtriya samta party (secular) hoga
 Ajay Singh Almasta, a close and former legislator of Arun Kumar, will be the national president of this party and Om Prakash Bind will be the party's Bihar president
 bataa den ki ajay singh almast saansad arun kumaar ke sabase bharosemand or kareebi maane jate hai
 Ajay Singh Almast, like Upendra Kushwaha, comes from the backward caste Kushwaha community
 ajay singh almast ke pita manjar laal kushvaha bhi apane jamaane ke bade netaa rahe hai
 In view of this, he is seen as an attempt to make a party penetration in Bihar's Kushwaha society by handing over the command of the party
 pradesh kii kaman bind kopradesh kii kaman omprakash bind jo ki atipichdi jati se aate hai
 Bind society also has a significant vote in Bihar
 maujuuda samay main ye samaaj nitish kumaar se saath he
 In such a situation, by handing over the command of Bihar Pradesh to Omprakash Bind, there is an attempt to help the most backward castes
 2014 main bani rlsparaelaesapi ke rashtriya adhyaksh upendra kushvaha or arun kumaar kii adaavat jagajaahir he
 However, Upendra Kushwaha and Arun Kumar together established the RLSP before the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 us vakt kushvaha party ke rashtriya adhyaksh or arun kumaar bihar pradesh ke adhyaksh banaae gaye the
 Only after this, along with BJP, he contested three Lok Sabha seats and won all the seats
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main upendra kushvaha karakaat loksabhaa se jabaki arun kumaar jahanabad se chunaav jitkar loksabhaa pahunche the or teesri seat sitamarhi se ramkumar verma ne jeet darj kii thi
 After winning the Darlok Sabha elections in both, Upendra Kushwaha was made Minister of State in the new government led by Narendra Modi
 rashtriya adhyaksh kaa pad bhi unke paas hi rahaa
 Later, after the differences between the two leaders of the party, the RLSP led by Upendra Kushwaha suspended Arun Kumar from the party, after which Arun Kumar was engaged in raising himself while staying within the NDA

 The alliance of leaders, officers and mafia has started to grab the grain of the poor
 pichley ek varsh ke dauraan pradesh ke kareeb har jile kii peedies main gadabadi kii shikaayat mili he
 "the coalition of grain mafia and officers in Gorakhpur has grabbed thousands of metric tons of APL wheat with regular allocation," says Sanjiv Mishra, a Gorakhpur social activist fighting against the mess in the PDS
 shikaayat karne par ye adhikari badi chaturaai se niyamit kii bajaae centre se har maheene milane vaale atirikt gehun kaa vitaran dikhaakar bachane kii jugat laga rahe hai
 On the target of APL wheat, the grain scam in the state, the highest APL wheat was also stolen
 is baar bhi kuch aisa hi he
 Actually there is no clear policy for wheat being allocated for distribution on APL ration cards
 anaaj mafia isi kaa phayda uthaata he or kadam-kadam par anaaj kii lut hoti he
 Officer S
 retired from Food and Logistics Department
 ke
 Verma says, "APL card holders in the city go to the lowest ration shops while Antyodaya's red ration card and white ration card for below poverty line (BPL) people demand food grains in the city and village alike
" it occurs
 isliye peedies ke jariye shahar main apiel anaaj kii bikri kar ghotaale ko anjaam diya jaataa he
 According to a standard of the Food and Logistics Department, no more than 10 kg of food grains will be given on an APL ration card
 ab jaraa gorakhpur kaa vakya dekhie
 In April 2013, 2,393 metric tonnes of wheat was distributed to a total of 1,60,969 APL card holders in urban areas
 agar yah maan liya jaae ki gorakhpur ke shahari ilaake main rahane vaala har apiel card dharak sarkari cote kii dukaan par rashan lene aayaa ho to ek card par 14 kilo gehun banta hoga jo swayan main hi maanak kaa ulanghan he
 Sanjeev Mishra says, "more than 60 percent of APL ration card holders living in Gorakhpur city do not go to the government flock to collect wheat
 agar 40 fisadi card dharakon ko 10 kilo ke hisaab se gehun diya gaya to baaki kaa anaaj kahaan gaya? '' anaaj chori ke tareeke or bhi hai
 Sacks of PDS food grains are now 50 kg instead of one quintal
 sitambar ke antim hafte main amethi ke block godaamon se anaaj kii jo boriyaan cotedaaron ko di gayi unamem keval 35 kilo hi rashan tha
 The sdms are investigating the matter
 bore ke jariye khelgodaam main anaaj ke bore rakhane kii kshamta kaa akalan gadabadi kii daastaan bayaan karata he
 Take Gorakhpur itself
 khaadya evam rasad vibhaag kii report ke anusaar, gorakhpur nagar main deepak kakkad or neelam kakkad ke naam se do godaam hai
 Both have a total capacity of 32,666 bags of quintals per month
 har maheene antyoday, bipiel, apiel, emdm yojana ke tahat niyamit or atirikt aavantit anaaj or chini kii maatra ko jod liya jaae to gorakhpur nagar main kul 44,722 quintal anaaj peedies ke tahat bantane ke liye pahunchataa he
 Since grain now comes in 50-50 kg sacks, the godowns in Gorakhpur city have the capacity to double 65,332 bags of 32,666, while the total allocated 44,722 quintals of grain will come in 89,444 bags
 is prakaar har maheene kshamta se adhik 2400 boriyaan kahaan or kaise rakhi ja rahi hai?anaaj kii boriyon ke jariye bhi khel ho rahaa he
 Sacks are supplied from Kolkata to the Food and Logistics Department to keep food grains
 in par company kaa naam, varsh or upi sarkaar likhaa hota he
 In Bareilly, there was no mark on about two and a half thousand sacks and through these, the matter of selling grains to rice mills was also revealed
 dhaandhlee karne waalon ke aise khel ko rokane ke liye khaadya or rasad vibhaag charmaraaye tantra se nigaraanee kar rahaa he
 There are 1,133 posts of marketing inspectors to be posted at the block level, of which more than 40 percent are lying vacant
 inke upar tehsil par aria marketing afasaron ke 468 pad hai jinamein keval 300 hi bhare hue hai
 The same situation is also with the supply inspector and district supply officers
 asal main upi kaa khaadya evam rasad vibhaag is maamle main desh kaa anokhaa he ki yahaan par ek hi vibhaag ke bheetar khaadya or vitaran kii alag-alag shakhaaen kaam kar rahi hai
 The government does not want to remove this fundamental irregularity, which is proving to be the biggest obstacle in curbing the grain scam

 However, the role of RSS is also considered important in bjp's decision
 baharhaal, is masale par siyaasi khinchataan jari he
 Fame on bail 
 
 ye koi jumala nahin he
 a rather bitter reality
 saal 1998 se, yani pichley 17 saal main salmaan ne jitna bhinam or paisa kamaaya wo jamaanat ke badaulatahai
 In fact, there are four cases against him in Jodhpur
 in sabhi maamalon main hit and ran cese kii tarah hi unhen bel mili he
 Salman Khansalman is still surrounded in five cases even though he got bail in the American Bakeryhit and Run case
 lekin aane vaali 14 may ko jodhpur kii adaalat main un par arms act ke tahat chal rahe ek duusare cese kaa faisla aana he
 After this, a hearing on the black deer hunting case is going to be held in Jodhpur court on June 1
 iske alaava rajasthan ke hai court main un par do or maamalon par sunwaayee honi he
 That is, the time to come can increase Salman's trouble
 rajasthan main un par chal rahe chaar maamalon main se do main unhen loar court se sajaa sunai ja chukaa he
 1 year jail in one case and 5 years in another case
 
 
 par rajasthan hai court ne unhen in donon hi maamalon main jamaanat ke naam par raahat di hui he
 If the case is prolonged then Salman will be benefited like this
 
 
 jaankaron ke mutabik kisi bhi cese kaa itnaa lanbaa chalanaa salmaan ke liye hi phydemand ho saktaa he
 People who testified against Salman in all these cases
 un sabhi kii umr us vakt 57-58 saal kii thi
 But now all are aged between 74-75 years old
 lihaaja vakt or umr ke saath-saath unki yaaddaasht bhi kamjor hui he
 Salman can benefit from this
 pehle bhi jail kii hawa kha chuke hai salmaan khansalmaan khan ko do chinkaara kaa shikaar karne ke maamle main or ghoda farm house shikaar maamle main van vibhaag ne sabase pehle 12 oktober 1998 main hiraasat main liya tha
 After this, Salman remained in judicial custody till 17 October
 10 april 2006 se 15 april 2006 tak yani 6 din ke liye central jail main rahanaa padaa
 Salman has spent 18 days in Jodhpur jail under police and judicial custody so far in three cases of black deer hunting
 or seshan court ne jab unki sajaa kii pushti kii thi to salmaan ko 26 agast 2007 se lekar 31 agast 2007 tak jail main rahanaa padaa tha
 Where is the important witness missing for 17 years? Haris Dulani is the person who is the most influential witness in all the four cases against Salman Khan in Rajasthan
 harish dulani shikaar ke vakt salmaan kii gypsy chalaa rahaa tha yani wo shikaar ke sabhi maamalon kaa chashmadid bhi he
 But surprisingly, Haris Dulani has been missing for the last 17 years
 logon ke mutabik harish dulani mumbai main he or kuch logon kaa maananaa ha ki wo videsh bhaag gaya he
 But till date no person has been able to cover the secret of the disappearance of Haris Dulani
 17 saal pehle harish dulani ek baar jodhpur se gaayab kya hua to wo phir dobaaraa kabhi laut kar jodhpur nahin aayaa
 Not only this, even his family members do not know where he is at the moment
 darasal harish dulani ne saal 1998 main salmaan khan ke khilaaf gavaahi di thi
 But a month later he was overturned by his statement
 uske baad wo aisa gaayab hua ki ajtak uskaa pataa nahin chal paaya he

 Suresh Kalmadi, the 69-year-old leader of the Congress, the "lifelong president" of the Athletic Association of India, remained president of the Olympic Association of India (IOA) for 15 years and until his name in the 2010 Commonwealth Games (CWG) scandal

 The provisions of a "new" and drafted IOA draft sent to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) for approval are shocking
 ye is baat kaa intjaam karte hai ki bhartiya khelon ke ye ladkadaate ghaagh apane-apane khel sanghon ke sirmaur bane rahenge, bhale hi unki umr or unka kaarykaal antarrashtriya olympic charter ke niyamon ke mutabik na ho

 During this meeting, it was decided in an hour that when the IOA is re-constituted at the end of this year, the heads of sports associations like Abhay Chautala (boxing), Narinder Batra (hockey) and Virender Nanavati (swimming) along with Bhanot will be there
 All arrangements will be made to keep the RSS on the posture of their unions

 antarrashtriya olympic samiti ne 4 disambar, 2012 ko bhartiya olympic sangh ko nilambit kar diya tha
 As a result, all Indian athletes have to compete in international events under the banner of IOC
 iosi ne ek chitthee bhejkar ioe ko uske nilamban kii teen vajahen bataai thim
 One is lack of autonomy, second is not to hold elections according to Olympic Charter and third is not to follow basic principles of morality and good governance
 iskaa matlab yah niklaa ki ioe ko sabhi maamalon main olympic charter ke mutabik nayaa samvidhan bananaa hoga, khaskar padaadhikariyon kii umr or kaarykaal ko lekar
 But by looking at the draft ioa's new constitution sent to the IOC for approval, it can be said that if it is approved, it will prove to be a blow to the fundamentals of the charter
 khaskar do ahm andekhiyon par jaraa najar daalate hai:1
 a member shall have the right to continue in the executive position for 20 consecutive years; Eight years as Treasurer or General Secretary and 12 years as Chairman
 iske baad chaar saal ke antaraal ke uparaant 70 saal kaa hone tak vah phir se 12 saal sangh main rah saktaa he
 (in contrast, Rule 20 of the Olympic Charter
 1 ke mutabik, kisi adhyaksh kaa kaarykaal sirf aath varsh kaa hota he
 It can be extended again for four years, but not after that
 )2
 The 70-year age limit applies only to three executive positions, not all members
 isse yah sunishchit ho jaataa he ki taqatvar prashaasak ritair hone kii umr ke baad bhi chunaav main apane rasookh kaa istemaal karata rahegaa
 (on the other hand, Rule 16 of the Olympic Charter
 3
 According to 3, "any member of the IOC can remain a member till the end of the calendar year in which he or she attains the age of 70 years
" ’’)ye praavdhaan is baat kaa pukhta intjaam karte hai ki koi prashaasak 70 saal kii umr hone tak ioe yaa kisi bhi rashtriya khel sangh par belgaum raaj kar saktaa he
 Worse, these provisions also give authority to an administrator like 81-year-old Malhotra to place his puppet in the position of head, instead of serving himself as vice-president, joint secretary or ordinary member
 Can
 itnaa hi nahin ioe ke adhikariyon ne olympic charter kii isse bhi badi andekhi karne kii taiyaari kar lee thi: unhone pad se ritair hone vaale adhyaksh ko chaar saal ke vishram ke dauraan bhi khel sangh kaa maanad adhyaksh banaae rakhane kaa adhikaar dene kaa vichaar kiya tha
 But in the end it was removed because they probably feared that the IOC officials would immediately realize the intent behind it
 is bare main ioe ke sanyukt sachiv rakesh gupta se jab sampark kiya gaya to unhone in praavdhaanon kaa bachaav kiya
 He gave such arguments for which no answer
 unheen ke shabdon main suniye: ‘‘bhartiya khelon main prashasan ke kshetra main niswaarth bhav se kaam karne vaale achche logon kii taadaad bahut zyada nahin he
 According to the Olympic Charter, the condition of 12 years on the tenure of office bearers is not practical for our country
 agar koi vyakti 40 saal kii umr main adhyaksh banataa he to charter ke niyamon ke anusaar vah sirf 52 saal kaa hone tak hi adhyaksh rah saktaa he
 If that administrator can work even further, then why should such a ban be imposed on him? ”according to Gupta Mahashi, as far as IOA is concerned, all the accused in the Commonwealth Games scam are capable of contesting elections as the court has given them Have not been convicted yet
 ve sawaal karte hai ki ‘‘agar cabinet mantri aaropon ke baavjood apane padon par bane rah sakate hai to ioe ke padaadhikari bhala kyon nahin rah sakate? kanoon kaa raaj kaayam rahanaa chahie
 These people must be considered innocent until proven guilty
 kalmadi mahoday, bhanot mahoday or verma mahoday sabhi agar chahen to chunaav ladgaye ke adhikari hai
 On October 4, 2012, the Ethics Commission of IOC (ethics Commission) recommended that Kalmadi, Bhanot and Verma be removed from IOA as criminal action against them has tarnished the Olympic Games image

 But given the ioa's record, the ministry should take strong steps instead of bowing down to officials who are trying their best to maintain their dominance

 Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu has suggested to replace the Sleeper Coach in trains with Reserve Chaircar for those traveling a short distance
 railway kii sehat ke liye kaati ja sakati he aapaki jecongreji akhbaar 'indian express' kii report ke mutabik, rail mantri ne vibhaag ko ek note bheja he, jisamen sujhaayaa gaya he ki sleeper coach kii jagah chairkaar lagaae jane se zyada se zyada yatri safar tay kar sakenge

 Baba, who exploits women in the name of faith and religion, is not deterring his antics

 Where a Baba kept a woman bound for many years in the name of getting rid of the upper bearing and raped the woman
 peedita ne police ko aapbeetee sunaate hue thane main maamla darj karaayaa he
 The victim woman, who reached Faridabad police, alleged that there is an ashram of Baba Ashok Mahant
 ab se kareeb 16 saal pehle wo apane parivaar ke saath pehali barbaba ke ashramagai thi
 Then Baba told his family members that he was overshadowed
 iske baad baba ne us sankat se chhutkaaraa dilaane ke naam par mahila ko apane ashram ke mandir main rahane ko majaboor kar diya
 The householder left the woman there and left
 iske baad baba ne mahila ke saath shaareerik sambandh bananaa chaahe to mahila ne inkaar kar diya
 Then Baba's mercury went up
 usne naa sirf us mahila ke saath marpet kii balki uske saath balaatkaar bhi kiya
 This sequence continued for many years
 mahila kaa kahana he ki jab bhi usne vahaan se bhaagane kii koshish kii to use pakad liya gaya
 Then Baba beat him fiercely
 wo hameshaa uske saath aisa hi karata tha
 Baba was also keeping the woman's family members in the name of upper crisis
 peedita ne police ko bataaya ki baba ne aasthaa ke naam par mahila ke makaan or uski bahan ke talaak ke baad mili 4 lakh rupee bhi hadap liye
 Now she wants the harshest action against accused Baba
 peedita ne faridabad ke mahila thane main shikaayat darj karaate hue nyaay kii guhaar lagaai he
 The police has registered a case against the accused Baba and two of his associates, taking the complaint of the woman seriously
 police kaa kahana he ki puraa maamle kii jaanch kii ja rahi he
 The woman says that if the investigation will be done, many more acts of Baba will be revealed
 mahila ke mutabik baba ne uske alaava kai or duusari mahilaon ko bhi apana shikaar banaaya he, lekin sabhi kisi naa kisi dar kii vajah se chup hai
 If Baba's actions are investigated in depth, the whole truth will be revealed
 philhal, police ne chaanbin shuru kar di he

 JNU President indian-american economist Abhijeet Banerjee has been awarded the Nobel Prize for Economics this year
 is bich nobel vijeta kaa jawahar laal nehru uniwarsity (jeenyu) conection bhi surkhiyon main bana hua he kyonki isi uniwarsity main padhai karte vakt wo tihaad gaye the
 In fact, the then JNU President NR Mohanty was expelled from the campus, which was strongly opposed by many students including Nobel laureate Abhijeet Banerjee
 aajtak
 in had a special conversation with NR Mohanty and knew what the whole matter was
 kyon nahin khush tha jeenyu administration?jeenyu ko khantee vamapanthiyon kaa garh mana jaataa he, lekin 1982-83 ke chaatr sangh chunaav main yahaan bada pherbadal hua tha kyonki yahaan jam chuke left (AISA) ko haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 The JNU administration was also not happy with this
 us vakt sthapit left sanghathanon ke baar se koi chaatraneta president bana tha
 The writer NR Mohanty was then the student union president
 unheen ke sanghathan ne jeenyu main sthapit vamapanthiyon ke myth ko todaa tha
 During that time, Mohanty was openly supported by Abhijeet Banerjee
 isi saal jeenyu main virodh kii aisi aandhi chali thi, jisamen abhijit banerjee ko bhi jail janaa padaa
 At that time, JNU student Yogendra Yadav, Sindhu Jha, Sunil Gupta and CPI leader Kanhaiya Kumar's guru SN Malakar were very active in student politics
 kya thi jeenyu main vidroh kii vajah?lekhak enaar mohanti ne bataaya ki jeenyu administration ne ek student ko hostel se nikaal diya tha
 There was a lot of resentment among the students about this
 main us vakt student union kaa president tha
 We went to meet the Vice Chancellor regarding this matter, when the student was asked about the reason for his removal from the hostel, the VC replied that he had misbehaved
 vahiin, students kii maang thi ki jaanch ke baad hi koi ection liya jaae
 NR Mohantymohanti said that earlier a student who was expelled from the hostel had compelled a teacher
 is complaint ke baad students bhi teacher ko nishkasit karne kii maang karne lage the
 Since the administration was not happy with our organization, that is why it was not ready for investigation and we too remained adamant on our demand
 is bich administration kii ore se student ke hostel room main dabl lock lagava diya gaya tha, jiske baad puraa maamla bigadaa tha
 About 700 students were arrested, Mohanty said that after the hostel room was locked, we started protesting and broke the lock and made the entry in that student's room
 isi ke baad puraa bavaal machaa tha
 The JNU administration expelled me, the union secretary and that student from the campus
 isi ection ke baad hi students ne puure jeenyu or vaais chancelar kaa gheraav kiya tha
 The case was so hot at that time that the police had to interfere
 iske baad police ham logon ko arest karke le gai thi
 Around 700 students were imprisoned, including around 250 girls
 mohanti ne bataaya abhijit banerjee mere junior the, lekin wo shuru se hamaare saport main the
 He also had to stay with me in Tihar Jail for this protest
 kisi union main nahin the abhijit banerjeeenar mohanti ne bataaya ki abhijit banerjee kisi union main nahin the, lekin jab main jeenyu ellection main president candidet ke rup main ladaa tha to unhone meraa khulkar saport kiya tha
 He told that we had formed a small organization on the JNU campus
 uskaa naam students for democratic socialism tha
 Due to this organization, i became the President of JNU
 mohanti ne bataaya ki abhijit bhale hi sanghathan se nahin jude the, lekin vichaaron par hamaara ek mat hua karata tha
 Mohanty told that last year i went to America
 maine sochaa tha ki boston main abhijit se mulaakat karuunga, lekin wo samar vekeshan main paris gaye the
 His wife Esther Duflo is of French descent and went to his in-laws during the holidays
 haalanki abhijit ne india aane par mulaakaat karne kii baat kahi he
 Tihar was mentioned after the Kanhaiya episode, JNU has been targeting BJP supporters for some time
 farvari main kanhaiya prakaran ke baad ek akhbaar main nobel vijeta abhijit banerjee ne ek artical likhaa tha
 In it, he said that we need a place of thinking like JNU and the government should definitely stay away from it
 isi lekh main unhone 1983 main tihaad jail 10 din kaatane kaa bhi zikr kiya tha
 He wrote that 1983 we students of JNU surrounded the VC
 visi ne us vakt hamaare student union ke presidant ko campus se nishkasit kar diya tha
 Meanwhile, the police came and took away hundreds of students, we were also beaten up
 lekin tab rajdroh jaisaa mukadmaa nahin hota tha
 However, there were allegations of attempt to murder
 centre sarkaar ne kai videshi sikhon par lage yatra kaa pabandi ko hataa diya he
 They were reportedly involved in subversive activities in the 1980s and 1990s
 unhen nigaraanee suchi main rakhaa gaya tha
 According to the information, the BJP government has probably done this by bowing to pressure from the ally Akali Dal ahead of the assembly elections in Punjab next year
 deshvirohi harakat karne waalon kii he kaali soochisuraksha agenciyon nepabandi vaali kaali suchi ko kai staron par taiyaar kiya tha
 The government has kept this blacklist of people of Indian origin mostly involved in subversive or anti-india activities and living outside the country
 is suchi main jin logon ke naam shaamil hai unhen bharat kii yatra se pratibandhit kiya gaya he
 May be the effect of Akali Dal pressure: Akali Dal chief and Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal, after writing a letter, requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi to remove the names of 36 Sikhs settled abroad, allegedly shortening the black list due to Modi's intervention
 has gone
 yah kadam isliye myne rakhata he ki punjab main vidhansabha chunaav agle saal ke shuruuaat main hone vaala he
 The BJP is included in the Badal government, while Union Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal is from the Akali Dal in the Modi government
 kaali suchi main ho sakate hai kai hajaar namgrih mantralay ke ek adhikari ne bataaya ki vibhinn saajhedaaron ke bich kaaphi charchaa ke baad kaali suchi se kuch naamon ko hataaya gaya he
 The exact number of people whose names have been removed from the black list is not known, but officials said that it is a large number
 unke mutabik is suchi main kai hajaar naam ho sakate hai
 What the Punjab CM and Deputy CM requested was that after Narendra Modi became Prime Minister in 2014, Prakash Singh Badal requested him to direct the Home Ministry that a mechanism should be created for regular review of all such cases
 badal ne kaha tha ki vah un logon ke naam hatwanaa chaahate hai jinke khilaaf koi maamla yaa kanoonee kaarywahi lambit nahin he
 Punjab Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Singh Badal also wrote a letter to Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh requesting him to review the black list of Sikhs
 saath hi un logon kaa naam hataane kaa anurodh kiya tha jo rajya main kisi aapraadhik maamle main vaanchit nahin hai
 a delegation of British Sikhs also requested the Prime Minister to remove the name of Sikhs from the list

 sarkaar kab mahasoos hoti he? jab sankat, beemaari, mahamari, aapadaa yaa haadase fat padate hai
 Government is an intangible entity, so most of the experience of governance is personal
 aapadaaen hi aksar gavarnence kii sakriyata or raajnneeti kii samvednishlata ko lekar thos or samuhik anubhav taiyaar karti hai
 Sadly, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government missed the first opportunity to make Delhi feel the government of Hamdard, which is suffering from infectious seasonal diseases, and is now being looted in the Supreme Court
 hakeekat yah he ki dilli ke apane duusare kaarykaal main aap, ab tak vaikalpik raajnneeti kaa sakaaratmak model nahin garh saki or gavarnence main bhi aise maukey par fisali jab use zyada samvedansheel hona chahie tha
 The influx of infectious diseases is not new, but the Delhi government, perhaps, was involved in a fight with the Center, was more masculine in electoral politics or was over-confident
 bimariyon yaa haadason kaa asar samay ke saath khatm hota he lekin inke bich log sarkaar ko apane saath jujhataa hua dekhnaa chaahate hai
 Leaders traveling abroad on such occasions, activists making absurd arguments, ministers accusing other agencies and ministers fretting over questions are a guarantee of political damage
 aap ke netaaon par dilli ke rajbhavan kii karravaayiyon main rajnatik shadyantr kii chaaya dikh sakati he lekin yadi koi sajeesh he to party ko or zyada sujh-boojh ke saath pratikriya kerani chahie thi
 But this new party may not encounter any politics other than confrontation
 isliye gavarnence ke moolbhoot kaamon par bhi aap ne takaraav ko hi samvaad bana liya
 In this long fight, not only was the governance field, but the Supreme Court imposed a fine on the AAP minister for default in basic governance like cleanliness, which is the first instance of its kind
 party ko rajnatik nuksaan kaa ehsaas jarur hoga, kyonki sankramak rogon se prabhavit hone vaale adhikansh log dilli main nikvan or madhyavarg ke hai, jo aap kii nai siyasat kaa aadhaar he
 AAP had to invent both new politics and new governance
 yah party bhartiya raajnneeti kii kshetreey, jaateey or vaicharik taksaalon se nahin nikali
 It was coined by the movement for change in governance
 sanyog se is party ko desh kii rajdhani main satta chalaane kaa bhavy janadesh mil gaya tha, isliye nai siyasat or nai sarkaar kii ummiden lajimi hai
 Delhi government has limited powers, this is not new but Kejriwal had to do politics of positive governance between these boundaries
 dilli kii satta main aap kii rajnatik shuruyaat bikharaav se hui or gavarnence kii shuruyaat takaraav se
 The party's internal democracy collapsed as soon as it came to power
 isliye vaikalpik raajnneeti kii ummiden jad nahin pakad sakin
 The Delhi government was also expected to undertake new experiments of governance which could form the basis of a positive opposition dialogue against the central government
 sach yah he ki sidhe takaraav ke alaava aap, centre kii gavarnence or nitiyon kii dhardaar or tathysangat samalochna viksit nahin kar pai
 From economic, policy, foreign policy, social services to employment and rural economy, there is a need for modern and futuristic dialogues, which you had the opportunity to start
 aise sanvaadon ko taiyaar karne ke liye dilli main aap ko nai gavarnence bhi dikhaani thi
 But despite the previous 49-day experiment, Arvind Kejriwal could not make his government a laboratory for innovative methods of administration that could form the basis of his national ambitions
 yahi vajah he ki aap raajnneeti va gavarnence ke sakaaratmak or gunatmak sanvaadon main koi jagah nahin bana saki, sirf centre se takaraav kii surkhiyaan batorne main lagi rahi
 For several months after coming to power, the leaders of the Modi government had also been cursing the Congress for all the past troubles
 yah ek kism kaa vipakshi samvaad tha, jisaki apeksha sarkaar se nahin kii jaati
 a year and a half later, the Modi government changed its dialogue, focused on implementation and agreed with the opposition, so there was an activeness in governance
 isi tarah har samasya ke liye centre se takaraav vaala kejariwal kaa dharawahik kuch zyada lanbaa khinch gaya jiske kaaran gavarnence sakriy nahin ho saki or dilli sarkaar vah kaam bhi karti nahin dikhi
 The experiences of AAP government in the national capital are being seriously tested all over the country
 punjab yaa goa ke chunaavon main matadaataaon ke paas puraane dalon ko aajamaane kaa vikalp maujuud he
 Therefore, if you consider yourself to be an option, then it has to be kept in mind that reference to the governance of Delhi will come in these elections
 philhal party ke chunavi sanvaadon main punjab yaa goa ke bhavishya ko sambodhit karne vaali nitiyaan nahin dikhti
 Default in killing mosquitoes and getting scammed by the Supreme Court on politics will outweigh the credibility of any government because such works are part of basic governance
 aap ke liye yah gafalat gambhir he kyonki kejariwal (dilli kii sanvaidhanik simaaon ke bich) nai vyavasthaaen dene kii ummid ke saath ubhare the
 Now they should first treat their government in Delhi and bring out the evidence of positive changes out of the conflicts
 aap kaa janadesh kamjor jameen par tikaa he
 He has nothing like ideology, family and geographical expansion, due to which old parties grow again and again
 aap ummiido kii tapish or majboot pratispardhi raajnneeti se ek saath mukaabil he
 So the risk of failure is many times higher than that of any old team
 kejariwal ko yah dar vaaki mahasoos hona chahieh gavarnence kii ek do badi chook unki raajnneeti ko chuk jane kii charchaaon main badal sakati he

 gaanaa 'pal main palat gai baaji' Acknowledging the lack of state Chief Minister Nitish Kumar at the bjp's Bihar Swabhiman rally, which is a conduit for the upcoming election campaign of the Bihar Legislative Assembly, senior party leader LK Advani urged him to forget the pledge and face the next election
 adwani ne gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi or nitish ke vigyapanon ko lekar upje vivaad ko shant karne kii kavayad main kaha, ‘‘manmutav hote rahete hai or jis vigyaapan main nitish or modi ko haath milaate hue dikhaaya gaya he, haath milaanaa to mitrataa kii nishaani he
 He urged that such things should not be overstated
 ullekhneey he ki bihar ke akhabaaron main narendra modi ke saath nitish ke photo vaale vigyapanon ko lekar mukhyamantri ne tikhi pratikriya di or unhone bhaajapa netaaon ke liye shanivaar ko yojit ratribhoj bhi radd kar diya
 After this, there were speculations that the partnership between BJP and JD u would be broken
 adwani ne aitihaasik gandhi maidan main raily ko sambodhan ke dauraan kaha, ‘‘mujhe bahut khushi hoti agar aaj is vishaal raily main nitish bhi hote
 He said, "little things keep happening, but i am confident that if the NDA continues to work as it did by turning misrule into good governance in Bihar, we will be successful throughout India
" ’’baton hi baton main bhaajapa netaa ne nitish ko yaad dilaayaa ki 1995 main mumbai main hue bhaajapa ke adhiveshan ke dauraan george furnandis vahaan ke jaslok aspataal main bhartee the or jab vah unhen dekhne gayi to nitish bhi vahaan maujuud the
 Advani said that at that time he requested Nitish to come to the convention and he was very happy that Nitish attended that session
 unhone nitish kii tarif karte hue kaha ki baad main jab rajg bana, to nitish usamen ek bahut safal mantri rahe
 However no other speaker, including Modi, had named Nitish and all credited Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi for the development of Bihar
 adwani ke is nitish gungan se lagata he ki bhaajapa vigyaapan maamle ko zyada tool nahin dena chaahati he or aglaa vidhansabha chunaav jad you ke saath milakar hi ladna chaahati he
 It will be interesting to see if Nitish accepts the reconciliation efforts made by Advani
 congress or aap ke bich gathbandhan kii baatcheet bhale hi vifal ho gai ho lekin kendriya mantri harshavardhan kaa maananaa he ki agar yah gathbandhan hua hota to isse bhaajapa ko na keval loksabhaa chunaav main balki agle saal hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav main bhi phayda miltaa
 In the Lok Sabha elections, BJP candidate from Chandni Chowk, Harsh Vardhan said, 'it is not a question for us whether the alliance was formed or not
 vyaktigat rup se mujhe lagata he ki agar ve gathbandhan karte or agar ham us samaj ke saath unhen haraate, to yah bhaajapa ke liye behatar hota kyonki tab ham agle chunaav main bhi iskaa dhyaan rakhte
 Harshvardhan said in an interview that he is confident that the BJP will win all the seven Lok Sabha seats in the national capital and is confident that the BJP will be ahead of both the Congress and the AAP
 kendriya mantri ne kaha, ‘jahaan tak bhaajapa kii baat he, agar donon partiyon (congress, aap) ke bich gathbandhan hua hota to main dilli main sabase khush vyakti hota
 Whether they fight alone or together, we are going to win
 ' unhone kaha, ‘bhaajapa, donon partiyon se kaaphi aage hai phir chaahe ve saath hon yaa alag hon
 BJP is getting tremendous response from the people
 aise main, is puri sthiti main koi doosraa sawaal hi paidaa nahin hota
 'significantly, even after much negotiation, there could not be an alliance between the Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)
 loksabhaa chunaav main harshavardhan chandani chowk sansadeey seat se bhaajapa ke pratyaashee hai jahaan unka muqabla congress ke jai prakaash agarwal or aap ke pankaj gupta se he
 All seven Lok Sabha seats in Delhi will go to polls on May 12

 He has filed a written complaint under section 420 in the police against the Meteorological Department
 raju shetty kaa kahana he ki mausam vibhaag ne is varsh monsoon pehle aane kaa anumaan lagaaya tha
 The Meteorological Department had predicted that the country would receive above-average rainfall
 shetty kaa aarope he ki rajya ke kai jilon membarishanheen ke baraabar hui, jiske kaaran kisaanon par dobaaraa buaai kii naubat ai he
 Let us tell you that Raju Shetty also agitated for milk producing farmers a few days ago
 doodh utpaadak kisaanon ko uchit keemat mili iske liye kolhapur se saansad shetty ke kaaryakartaaon ne maharashtra main doodh andolan kiya tha
 The state government had to bow to Shetty's movement
 nagpur monsoon satr main sarkaar ne doodh utpaadak kisaanon ko 25 rupee prati litre kaa bhav dene kaa adhyadesh nikaala
 Now almost within a month, once again Raju Shetty has come forward for the justice of the farmers
 unka kahana he ki marathavada or vidarbha ilaakon ke bade hisse main akaal ke halaat bane hue hai
 Some areas of Amravati, Wardha, Akola, Buldhana, Yavatmal have received less rainfall
 kisaan khud ko mausam vibhaag ke haathon thaga hua mahasoos kar rahaa he
 MP Raju Shetty has filed a complaint with the Meteorological Department for miscalculation, not taking action
 ab dekhnaa ye hoga ke police is maamle kii tafteesh kaise karti he
 Tight relations between Shiv Sena and BJP are no secret and now the party's mouthpiece Saamana has targeted the Yogi Adityanath government of UP
 patr main chape lekh main rajya kii kanoon-vyavastha ko lekar yogi sarkaar ko aade haathon liya gaya
 Is this 'sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas'? The article printed in Saamna says that since the rule of Yogi has come in UP, criminals have become fearless, their speed has become high-speed
 mukhpatr main likhaa gaya he, 'upi main ho rahe ghatnakram rajya kii chaati par mung dal rahe hai
 The victims are screaming out at the Yogi - Is this the sabka saath, sabka vikas? "was the previous government bad?" The article asked if the same situation was to happen in Yogiraj, what was the Akhilesh government bad? According to Saamana, before the UP elections, BJP leaders promised to make the state crime-free by strangling them
 mukhyamantri satta sanbhaalane ke baad kai baar kah chuke hai ki kisi ko kanoon apane haath main lene nahin diya jayega
 According to the letter, the claims of cm's claim are being exposed in the day of domineering in UP
 'yogiraj main apradhi nidar'lekh main kaha gaya he,'pichley 2-3 maheenon main apradhi behad nidar ho gaye hai
 During this time, the increase in crimes is giving evidence of this
 maamle chaahe lutpaat ke hon, katl ke, balaatkaar ke yaa phir sampradayik dangon ke
 Criminals of all kinds are showing their jauhar in Gundaraja of UP
 ' lekh main daawa kiya gaya he ki pradesh main hai speed train bhale naa chali ho lekin aparaadhiyon ke hausale jarur 'hai speed' ho gaye hai
 Accusations of opposition not 'wrong', Shiv Sena believes if the Yogi government in UP is not going beyond the culprits
 aise main agar vipaksh upi sarkaar par aarope lagaae to wo galat nahin hai kyonki upi main apradhi hi kanoon banaate hai or vahi kanoon todate bhi hai
 According to the article, 'the people of UP will need another government to answer these questions
 ' If you get stuck for some reason during the air journey and you missed your connecting flight, then this offer of DGCA is very special for you
 diarector general of civil aviation (dijisie) ne paisanger ke adhikaron kii suchi main badlaav kaa prastaav diya he ki yadi kisi paisanger kii connecting flite shuruaati flite ke let hone athwa cancel hone kii vajah se chhot jaati he to airline paisanger ko 20,000 rupee bataur jurmaana adaa karegi
 The DGCA has proposed a change in passenger rights that if an airline refuses to forcibly board a passenger, a compensation of Rs 5,000 will be paid to that passenger
 aamtaur par over booking ke chalate airlines kuch paisangers ko board paas nahin jari karatin or paisangers ko duusari flite se tikat book karana padataa he
 The DGCA has proposed this after the increase in incidents of not giving boarding passes
 haalanki dijisie ke in prastaavon kaa federation of indian airlines (exe) or gaiyr exe airlines jaise vistara or air asia india ne virodh kiya he
 Significantly, for the first time DGCA has proposed such a huge compensation
 ise padhein: aasaan hua hawaii safar, paisanger ko nahin rakhana hoga boarding pasin prastaavon ke alaava dijisie ne yah bhi prastaav diya he ki yadi kisi udaan main 120 minute se adhik kaa taramac dile (jab koi hawaii jahaaj udaan bharne ke liye ranve par intjaar kar rahaa ho yaa turant land karne kii sthiti main aage kii udaan jari karne main vakt lag rahaa ho) ho to aisi sthiti main paisanger ko plane se utarane or apni yatra cancil karne kaa adhikaar ho
 Significantly, there are more incidents of Tarmac delays in the country, especially in cold weather
 in prastaavon ke virodh main jet airways, indigo or go air ne maang kii he ki maujuuda niyamon ko hi jari rakhaa jaae
 At present, there is no provision for any compensation to the passenger in case of such delay
 haalanki, vistara ne in prastaavon par antim faisle se pehle maang kii he ki dijisie ko gharelu or antarrashtriya udaanon ke liye muaavje kaa alag-alag praavdhaan karnaa chahie
 It is to be noted that earlier the Ministry of Civil Aviation had proposed an increase in compensation for loss of life and property during air travel
 iske saath hi mantralay ne dijisie se air tikat canslation fees main katautee karne ke praavdhaan ke saath-saath yatriyon ko flite chhootane kii sthiti main muaavja dene kaa prastaav dene ke liye kaha tha
 After the Delhi High Court order, the Aam Aadmi Party may have reacted aggressively and also asked to challenge the order in the Supreme Court
 lekin sarkari kaamkaaj main uske tevar deele najar aa rahe hai or ab kejariwal sarkaar request mod main aa gai he
 The High Court, in its order, had considered LGCO the only administrator in Delhi and had given their approval necessary in government work
 lekin aadesh ke baad pehle to aap ne supreme court jane kii baat kahi thi or baad main kejariwal ke sahyogiyon ne dilliwaalon ko samasyaayein lekar alji ke paas jane kii salaah di
 But now it seems that the compulsion to run the government has forced the leaders of AAP to change the tone
 mantriyon ke paas nahin aaengi trsanfer-posting kii filanshuukravaar ko dilli ke upmukhyamantri manish sisodiya ne kaha ki alji nehai courtke faisle ke baad ek order nikaala he, jisamen unhone kaha he ki dilli main iees or danix afasaron kii transfar posting or services vibhaag se jude saare maamle unke adheen honge
 According to Sisodia, now no transfer-posting files will come to his ministers
 uparajyapal se mili sisodiyisi silsile main manish sisodiya ne shuukravaar ko alji se bhi mulaakaat kii
 According to Sisodia, he has requested LG to do the transfer-posting of course
 lekin unke do afasaro kii niyukti wo nahin chhenden
 Sisodia said that he has urged LG not to remove PWD Secretary and Health Secretary, as both these officers are doing education and health work very well
 gauratlab he ki dilli sarkaar ne paramparaagat tareeke se iees kii niyukti vaali jagah par duusari services ke afasaron kii niyukti kii he
 PWD secretary has been made an officer of an engineering service, while a doctor has been appointed as secretary in the health department
 sisodiya ne daawa kiya ki peedbludi ko ek ejeeniyar bahut behatar dhang se chalaa saktaa he or swasthya vibhaag ko doctor hi dhang se samaj saktaa he
 In Uttar Pradesh's capital Lucknow, criminals once again committed a serious robbery
 badmaashon ne din dahaade ek mahila bank manager se 20 lakh rupee lut liye
 At the time of the incident, the manager was going to deposit the money with a colleague in the bank
 lut kii yah sansanikhej vaardaat lakhanu ke kaint ilaake main hui
 Actually, a woman named Nirmala Devi is posted as a manager in the United Bank
 guuruuvaar ko vah alambag ilaake ke kotak mahindra bank se 20 lakh rupee nikaalkar apni car se kaint ilaake ke united bank main jamaa karne pahunchi thi
 Meanwhile, two miscreants arrived on the bike and escaped by snatching a bag full of money from Nirmala's hand
 nirmala ne turant police ko soochna di
 As soon as the news of the robbery started, the police officials also reached the spot
 nirmala ne police ko sari jaankaree di

 aaj se thik ek maheene pehle 26 april ko Gionee ne market main vaapasi karte hue do nae bajet smartphone Gionee S11 Lite or F205 ko launch kiya tha
 We have used S11 Lite and now we are passing it on to you
 company ne isaki keemat 13,999 rupee rakhi he
 In terms of price, this is the exact segment where Xiaomi, Moto and Asus occupy
 to ham aapako yahaan bataa rahen he ki company kii bazaar main vaapasi kitni safal rahi
 Built-quality and display: Metal body is usually given on the back panel of smartphones in this segment, but Gionee has given plastic body in the back panel of this smartphone
 body plastic kii he lekin phil glass vaali detii he
 The company's logo is given in the bottom on the back panel
 saath hi back main dual camera seoup, fingerprint sensor or flash bhi maujuud he
 Due to its plastic body, the weight of this smartphone is quite low and this is quite a good thing
 luk kii baat karen to iskaa overol luk bhi kaaphi premium he
 The back panel is glossy finish
 isi vajah se isamen thodi der upyog ke baad ungaliyon ke nishaan dikhaai dene lagate hai
 The volume rocker and power button are given on the right side and the Type b charging port, audio jack and speaker are given at the bottom
 hamen smartphone kii keemat ke lihaaj se tip si kii ummid thi
 However, in terms of display, the Gionee S11 Lite in 2
 5D gorilla glass ke saath 5
 a 70-inch HD + full view display is provided
 yani is smartphone main phul HD disple kii kami he
 Since FHD + display is given in smartphones with this price
 is haalia trend ke hisaab se 18:9 reshyo bhi diya gaya he jo aapako movie yaa video ke dauraan behatar phil detaa he
 The response of the colors and brightness of the display of this smartphone is better, although you will need to increase the brightness while using it in the sun
 vuing angel bhi ye smartphone behatar he
 But we have many complaints about touch
 iskaa tach smood nahin he
 Battery: This smartphone has a 3030mah battery and the company has promised to last it all day in a single charge
 yahaan company kaa daawa sahi thahartaa he
 We have used it very much as a primary phone continuously and the battery of this smartphone supports you to a great extent, but not as much as it can be compared to the rest of the smartphones in this range
 agar aap internet wi-fi ke jariye chalaate hai to ye smartphone thode zyada vakt tak aapkaa saath detaa he lekin mobile network par chalaane se bydaree jaldi saath chhod detii he
 Also, let us tell you specifically that it takes a lot of time to charge it as well
 haalanki hamane duusari company ke charger se charge kiya tha, kyonki company ne rivyuu ke dauraan charger nahin bheja tha
 It is possible that the battery can be charged quickly by the company's charger
 camera:is smartphone main maujuud camere kii baat karen to iske back main 13 megapixl or 2 megapixl ke do camere die gaye hai
 At the same time, there is a 16-megapixel camera in its front
 sabase pehle iske back camere kii baat karen to isaki parformens behad niraashajanak he
 If you expect bokeh mode as soon as you see dual cameras then you will be very disappointed
 kyonki kisi bhi subject ke border par aapako sharpaness nahin dekhne ko milegi
 Also, you will have to struggle a lot while focusing
 iske alaava iskaa shater bhi slo rispons detaa he or bina portret mod ke bhi focus lock karnaa behad mushkil he
 Talking about lighting conditions, the photos get clicked in sufficient light but detailing is not available
 saath hi macro photo lene ke dauraan bhi aap shorpaness ko lekar kaaphi niraash honge
 Similarly, trouble in low light increases even more
 yadi aap minial mod kaa upyog kar ISO badha bhi dete hai tab bhi diteling had se zyada kam rahati he
 That is, you cannot expect good photography from this mobile in low-light
 ab agar selfi camere kii baat karen to yahaan kuch had camera behatar he
 In better lighting conditions, the camera responds better, but in low-light, the problem of noise comes again
 lekin front camera phir bhi back camere kii tulana main behatar he
 Our experience of video calling with front camera was also better
 parformens:is smartphone main die gaye spacifications kii baat karen to isamen4gb raimaur Adreno 505 GPU ke saath 1
 Qualcomm Snapdragon 430 processor with 4ghz speed has been given
 isaki internal memory 32GB kii he jise card kii madad se 256GB tak badhaayaa ja saktaa he
 This smartphone Android 7
 1 nugat besd custom Amigo 5
 Runs at 0
 is smartphone ke procesar ne hi sabase zyada niraash kiya he kyonki is price range ke smartphone main 400 kii 600 siries ke procesar kii ummid kii jaati he
 When you switch between apps in this smartphone, it will start lagging here
 smartphone itnaa slo he ki yadi aap number dial karne kaa pad bhi open karnaa chahen to aapako apane kuch seconds dene padenge
 Also, when you open several apps at once and start using them simultaneously, this smartphone hangs completely
 isi tarah yadi ek saath dheron notification aa jaaen tab bhi phone kaa parformens kaaphi niraash kar degaa
 However, the experience of this smartphone was somewhat fine while playing heavy games
 lekin garm hone kii shikaayat main jarur karnaa chaahunga
 Apart from all this, if we talk about the fingerprint sensor, then here too it stays behind
 iskaa fingerprint sensor bhi kaaphi der main rispons karata he
 The reason is that we thought it better to use several patterns
 baaki is smartphone main UC broujar, fasebuk, instagram, massenger or whatsap jaise eps pre-loded die gaye hai
 Verdict: i would definitely not advise you customers to invest in this smartphone
 kyonki is price range main duusari companiyon ke behatar products bazaar main uplabdh hai
 Especially Xiaomi has a lot of smartphones at a lower price
 is smartphone kaa halkaa hona or premium luk vaala hona isaki khaas baton main se ek he
 The smartphone is far behind in all cases, whether it is camera or overall performance
