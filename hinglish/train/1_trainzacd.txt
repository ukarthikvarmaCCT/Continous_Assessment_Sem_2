 Siddaramaiah for the Congress and BS Yeddyurappa from the BJP are the contenders for the post of Chief Minister
 in 2 naamon ke alaava 3 or aise naam hai, jo siem kii qatari main hai
 There is a discussion in the political corridors from Delhi to Bangalore that in the event of no party getting a clear majority, the head of any one of these 3 names can crown the crown of the Chief Minister
 bijepi ke siem candidet bies yediurppabies yediurppa bijepi ke bahumat paane kii surat main mukhyamantri ke ummidavaar hai
 In Karnataka, senior leaders from the BJP are already the chief ministerial candidates announced by the BJP
 yediurppa ko bhi apni jeet kaa puraa bharosa he
 Due to this, he seemed confident about his victory till some time before the vote
 matganana se thik ek din pehle bhi unhone daawa kiya ki wo jeet rahe hai
 They have even claimed that they are going to Delhi to meet PM Modi in the evening on 15 May
 siddharmaiya kii prabal sambhaavnaenchunaav main congress bahumat paati he to siddharmaiya mukhyamantri pad ke sabase prabal daavedaar hai
 If the Congress gets an absolute majority in Karnataka, Siddaramaiah will grow not only in Karnataka but also at the national level
 aisi sthiti main unka kad rahul gandhi or sonia gandhi ke baad congress main tisare sabase bade netaa ke taur par ubharegaa
 If the Congress gets a majority in Karnataka, then it will be like a stamp of Rahul Gandhi's party leadership
 rahul gandhi ke congress adhyaksh banane ke baad ye pehla vidhansabha chunaav he or usamen shandaar jeet milti he to unke leadership kaushal ko virdohi bhi rashtriya str par nazarandaaj nahin kar sakenge
 If Congress does not get majority
 
 
 matganana main agar congress sabase badi party ke taur par ubhartee he, lekin bahumat se dur rahati he to siddharmaiya ke dobaaraa mukhyamantri banane kii sambhaavnaaon ko karaara jhatka lagegaa
 JDS will not be ready to support Siddaramaiah-led Congress
 siddharmaiya bhi dalit chehre ke liye mukhyamantri kii daavedaari chhodane ko taiyaar dikh rahe hai
 In such a situation, the name of Mallikarjun Kharge and Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee President G
 Parmeshwar comes out most strongly as a Dalit face in the party
 dalit chehre main mallikarjun khadge sabase agekhadge kaa naam 2013 main bhi congress kii ore se mukhyamantri ke rup main chal rahaa tha, lekin us vakt siddharmaiya ne baaji maar lee thi
 If in the changed circumstances, Kharge had to be sent as CM, Rahul himself can take over the post of leader of the party in the Lok Sabha
 khadge karnataka kii bidar vidhansabha se aate hai
 Apart from having long experience in the politics of the Center, he has also been the President of Karnataka Congress
 karnataka pradesh adhyaksh ji parameshwar bhi line menkarnataka pradesh congress ke adhyaksh ji parameshwar dalit mukhyamantri ke rup main khadge ke baad duusare number ke chehre hai
 In 2013, g Parameshwara played an important role in the victory of Congress
 haalanki, ve khud apni seat nahin bachaa sake or chunaav haar gaye
 Because of this, he was still lagging behind in the race for the post of CM
 lekin is baar agar dalit chehre kii talash hui to ve is baar bhi daud main majbootee se bane hue hai
 Kumaraswamy's prospects are also the key to JDS
 aise main jedies ke kumaraswami ke bhi mukhyamantri banane kii sambhaavnaaon ko nakaara nahin ja saktaa he
 This possibility is also strengthened because the Congress would not like to see the BJP take over power under any circumstances
 aise main congress jedies ko baahar se samarthan de sakati he or kumaar swami mukhyamantri kii kursi par virajman ho sakate hai
 Kumaraswamy could have some advantage even if he has a grand alliance in 2019

 ’ During the era of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, no one has the courage to speak against the Bharatiya Janata Party or against them
 kai baar bhaajapa se jude log party kii manshaa par sawaal uthaate bhi hai, lekin modi ke khilaaf bolne kaa saahas koi nahin dikhaa paata
 In such a situation, 2 senior party leaders are making rhetoric against the party these days
 khaas baat yah he ki donon kaa sarnem sinha hi he or donon ne bihar se raajnneeti kii shuruyaat kii
 Both have also been senior central ministers during the reign of Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 bade faislon ke khilaaf 2 sinhavartmaan pariprekshya main yashavanth sinha or shatrughan sinha bhaajapa se jude do aise rajaneta hai jo party par lagaataar hamalavar bane hue hai
 It is believed that both are extremely hurt by their neglect in the party, which is probably why both of them go against the party line when given a chance
 khaas baat yah he ki party alaakaman in 2 netaaon se jude har prakaran par chuppi saadh jaati he
 Recently, on the recommendation of the Election Commission on behalf of President Ram Nath Kovind, 20 mlas of the ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) lost their membership in the post of profit in the Delhi Assembly
 aap party ise modi or bhaajapa kii sajeesh bataa rahi he, usne faisle ke khilaaf hai court chali gai he
 Many parties, including BJP and Congress, are seen standing together on this matter, but these two senior leaders of the ruling BJP at the Center are angry and they have taken rebellious attitude again
 yashavanth sinha ne twit kar is faisle ko 'tughlakashahi' qaraar diya
 He tweeted, "president's decision to disqualify 20 Aam Aadmi Party mlas is against the nature of justice
 is maamle main koi sunwaayee nahin hui or na hi hycourt ke faisle kaa intjaar kiya gaya
 This is the worst order of the Tughlaq
 ''duusari ore, shatrughan sinha bhi is faisle ke khilaaf ho gaye hai or party kii line ke khilaaf jate hue aap party kaa samarthan kiya he
 He wrote in tweeting, "'AAP' came, 'AAP' dominated, 'AAP' was the 'AAP' spread in the discussion
" ghar-ghar main, har khabar main to kis baat kii phikar 'aap' ko? hiton kii raajnneeti zyada nahin chalati
 Don't worry, be happy! "he said in another tweet, hope and pray that you get justice soon
 'aap' kii team or khaskar 'aap' ko bahut bahut badhai
 Sinhayah is not the first time against demonetisation and GST when Sinha, two BJP stalwarts, has shocked people by going opposite the partyline
 purv vitt or videsh mantri yashavanth sinha sarkaar ke saahasik faislon notebandi or jiesti ke khilaaf jamkar hamalaa bol chuke hai
 He openly criticized the economic policies of the Narendra Modi government on several occasions and stated the need for 'lok Shakti' to control 'rajshakti'
 iske alaava yashavanth ne party pramukh amit shah ke bete jayant shah kii aay se adhik sampati banane ke maamle main party ko aade haathon liya
 To this, he had said, it seems that the party has lost its high moral ground earned over so many years
 yashavanth sinha yaheen nahin ruke unhone party ke khilaaf apana baagi tevar jari rakhaa
 a few days ago, he had said in a program that today's BJP is no longer the BJP that was at the time of Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Lal Krishna Advani
 modi ke mantri 'chaapluus'yashavanth kii tarah shatrughan sinha bhi party ke khilaaf jhanda buland kiye hue hai
 Criticized the party for its membership of AAP mlas
 vah pehle bhi kai baar party ke khilaaf gaye hai
 Actor-turned-politician Shatrughan Sinha once said, if the BJP survives the 'one-man show and two-man army', then it will only live up to the expectations of the people
 unhone bhi notebandi or jiesti kii khub aalochana kii he
 At the same time, Modi's close and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has been continuously targeted
 notebandi par unhone kaha tha ki notebandi se sabhi ko bahut dikkatein huin, factory band ho gaye, utpaadan gir gaya, berogari bad gai
 The situation became trivial
 unhen hi nahin, bahut saare logon ko laga or vah ise chhupaakar nahin kah sakate
 At the same time, he said that it has become 'neither live nor live let', while copying Prime Minister Modi's statement on corruption, 'naam khoona na khoona lenga'
 unhone pichley saal november main aarope lagaaya ki modi ke 90 fisadi mantri chaapluus hai or unhen koi nahin jaanata
 However, it is also interesting that nothing was said in view of the rebellious stand of these two leaders at the top level of the party
 party bhi unke khilaaf koi ection nahin le rahi
 The way Yashwant Sinha has been rebelling in the last few months, he could have got a severe punishment from the party, but the party high command has been tight-lipped in this matter, the same is with 'shotgun' Shatrughan Sinha
 
 shaayad donon ko ummid thi ki modiraj main unhen 'kuch' milegaa, lekin unki aas adhuri rah gai, vahiin party in donon par chup rahakar yah nahin dikhaanaa chaahati ki nayaa netritv puraane diggajon ko saath nahin rakh paa rahi

 10 point film rivyuu: bie passtar: paanch main se chaar stardiarectorntjay bahal,actorshilpa shukla, shaadaab camel, divyendu bhattacharya, rajesh sharma, dipti naval1 irotica nahin he yekssbase pehle sabase jaruri baat
 Do not go to the trailer of the movie BA Pass
 ye koi nasha tip ghatiya film nahin he, jisamen ek yangster or ek usase zyada umr kii aurat ke bich sex dikhaane ke si grad bahaane khoje gaye hon
 Although the film Ram Jaane Why is being promoted like that
 ye film sabase pehle ek ladke kii majaburi or kashmakash kii kahani he
 For sisters, for themselves, for good times, he inadvertently becomes a male prostitute
 isaki shuruyaat karti hai uski buaa kii dost ek anti
 In the midst of all this there are more worldly revolutions, which are compassionate, human, and repeatedly tell us whether something creeps behind the wall of Delhi in the day, at night, in the morning, in the evening and not even in the eyes
 Comes
 2 railway anti or plotofilm mohan sikaa kii kahani ‘da railway anti’ par besd he
 Take the hint of the story now
 mukesh anaath ho gaya he
 It is the responsibility of two sisters who are in the government ashram from the girls' shedi
 mukesh buree buaa or unke kamine bete ke paas rahakar bie paas course kar rahaa he
 Then she is seen by aunt's wife and kitty friend Sarika Aunty
 antee kii najare inayat hoti he or phir kai aantiyon kii
 But then something happens that all bets are reversed
 is fite main jo friend bane the, unke bhi kuch kisse hai
 Together these form a tragic collage in the last
 3 heroin koun honi thiofilmi khabaron par jaaen to diarector ajay bahal railway anti ke liye dilli kii jubaani or samaj rakhane vaali ladki chaahate the
 She is also not a Chokri type, an actress who looks like a woman, rather than a girl opshan do tay hue
 Richa Chadha and Shilpa Shukla
 shilpa ke saath ek dout tha ki unki chak de india kii image abhi tak kairi ho rahi thi
 Just then Richa got Anurag Kashyap's Gangs of Wasseypur and Ajay also encouraged him for this
 or is tarah sarika antee kaa damdaar or chunauteepurn role mila shilpa ko
 4 Shilpa Shukla's work: As a critic, an audience and a human being, i have become a fan of Shilpa Shukla
 chak de india main unhone bindiya nayak ko jinda kar diya
 The same player stood firmly in front of Shahrukh
 tughlaq bolte, chen kholte yaa baghawat ke sur alaapti hui
 He also spared BA pass the most dense color
 iktarafa chhichhori kamini aurat kaa role nahin he ye
 There were also some thirsty, some wise and some annoying shades
 shilpa ne apni aawaaj, ankhon ke utaar chadhaav or tehraav or deh bhashaa se ise nae maane die
 He again raised the scale of acting for himself
 badhai is irotic se dikhte magar gaharaai liye role ko kubulane or nibhaane kii
 5 Nada Le Gaye Shadab: In the film, Mukesh's face was often seen with intrepid gesture, sometimes some zeal and sometimes some nobility
 shaadaab ne ye sab dikhaaya bina phani dikhe
 i don't know much about his acting career
 magar shilpa, rajesh or duusare manze hue theatre or filmi actors ke saamne ve nausikhie to nahin hi lage
 He will be able to carry that dilemma and then in the intimate scenes with Sarika Aunty in the category of success
 or phir wo laachaargi bhare second half ke kuch seens bhi
 Good job my boy
 6 baaki actors kaise theikya casting kii gai he janaab
 Didn't think that they were watching the actors
 kabristaan ke johny ke role main divyendu jinhen aap dev di ke dalle ke rup main dekh chuke hai
 Darling actor Rajesh Sharma as Sarika's husband did not have much footage
 par jitna bhi tha use acha treetment mila
 Similarly, the middle class cry of parathe bani and false poverty, be it Geeta Agarwal in Mukesh's aunt's role or Happy Ranjith who lives a double life in the role of ph
d
, all have their corner of the film and give some extra meaning
 7 ek kisse ke kankal par uge kai or angambie paas sirf mukesh ke sarika ke jaal main funsane kii kahani nahin he
 It has Delhi hidden behind the curtains of day and night
 subah footne se pehle tak sadak kinare lipe pute khadey launde hai
 In Kholi, there are some disgusting people hanging dreams with colorful postcards
 kasparov or korpov kii ladai he
 With the help of the kitty party, the boss is involved in the good book
 takalif kii tanhaai main kharch hoti ek aurat he, jise dipti naval ne nibhaayaa he
 Small role, but remember forever
 kuch bahanen hai jo wardan ke shikanje se bachane ko bekaraar hai
 There is a brother who is running the last race between phone bells and sirens
 8 ashleel hue bina bold plot dikhaaya diarector bahal neofilm ke diarector ne pehali baar ye topi pahani he
 But it does not seem so
 jaisaa maine sabase pehle kaha ki film bold he
 There are many close scenes
 magar kahin bhi baglein jhaankne kii jarurat nahin padati
 Nothing looks vulgar
 camera kareeb aata he, to chehre kii rangath dikhaane ke liye
 Goes away just to know what is going on
 magar ye seen chehre par aakar chipakate nahin
 Railway aunt is a story, but Ajay has given it a good cinematic detail
 dilli kii kuch nai lokation bhi khojkar laae hai wo
 Overall, the film has won as many awards
 wo vaaki public ke parde par bhi unhen jastiphai karti he
 9 Some Foot Notes too: If Hindi is a film then there will be music
 yahaan bhi he magar becoground score kii tarah
 Just like it happens in life
 alokananda dasgupta ne use bojhil nahin banane diya
 He does not dilute the story, its effect
 or ye hindi filmon ke lihaaj se behad ahm kamyaabi he
 Similarly, in the first half of the film, it may seem that in the first half, it is okay, brother understood that Mukesh got involved in it
 ab kitna khinchoge
 But in the second half, the film that catches speed, on the straight end, it is spared
 camera work or lokation anuraag kashyap ke cinema kii yaad dilaataa he
 Far from New Delhi, the real-new Sarai Rohilla Numa locales of Old Delhi look like a camera hanging in a loaf and a worn-out AIIMS flyover
 ye film ke kuch or majboot paksh hai
 10 And finally, Prayer: a big filmmaker is not someone who can say something to certain characters in due time
 bada filmkaar wo he jo un kirdaaron ko us vakt main aapke jehan main pabast kar de
 Tell the film to end on screen
 magar aap jab lauten to saath main kirdaar bhi lauten
 Some questions were also returned, to which you keep composing the answer as to what happened to it
 vaisaa bhi to ho saktaa tha
 If i were, i would do like this
 kuch kirdaaron ke liye prarthana si chalati rahe ki kaash kuch thik ho jaataa uske saath
 This is not incompleteness, but the success of the new trend
 film jab khatm hoti he, to kuch khatm hota he, magar kuch shuru bhi hota he
 Not everything is visible on the screen
 isliye rah jaataa he dimag main
 i am again repeating the advice to the public that BA is not a cheap c grade film, it is a very tragic, emotional and complex story and this film must be seen
 america main bhedbhaav ke kathith maamle main ek 40 varshiya muslim vyakti ko america airlines ke plane se neeche utaar diya gaya
 The woman of the aircraft was repeatedly announcing the person's name and seat number, saying that she was eyeing them

 ) After being denied a visa to visit the US, Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi addressed the indian-american community through video conferencing and said that for him the definition of secularism is 'india first'
 saal 2002 ke godhra cond ke baad gujarat main bhadke dangon main musalamaanon ke maare jane kii vajah se aalochana jhelane vaale modi ne kareeb aadhe ghante lambey apane bhaashan main is vivaadit mudde kaa zikr tak nahin kiya
 Modi said, my definition of secularism is quite simple, 'first India'
 aap jo bhi karen, jahaan kahin bhi kaam karen, iske sabhi nagarikon ke liye bharat hi sarvocch praathamikta honi chahie
 The Chief Minister of Gujarat said, the country is above all religions and ideologies
 unhone kaha ki logon ko isi siddhant kaa paalan karnaa chahie
 Modi said, i agree with friends that as an Indian, as a citizen who loves India, you too will agree with my definition
 
 
 ham koi bhi kaam karen yaa koi bhi faisla karen, sabase upar bharat hi hona chahie
 The BJP leader said that nothing less than India's interest should be our goal and if this happens, secularism will automatically run in our veins
 maanavadhikaar hanan ke mudde par modi ko america vija se inkaar kar diya gaya tha
 Modi's speech as a keynote speaker at the Wharton India Economic Forum was canceled last week
 uniwarsity of pencilvenia ke prophessoron or chaatro ke ek tabake kii ore se modi kaa virodh kiye jane kii vajah se bhaashan ko radd karnaa padaa tha
 However, in his address, Modi did not say anything about the Wharton issue
 wharton vivaad se kaaphi pehle ‘oversij frends of bijepi’ kii ore se is kaarykram kii yojana banaai gai thi
 Hundreds of people had gathered in New Jersey's Edison and Chicago to hear Modi's speech
 apane sambodhan main modi ne yuvaaon ke kaushalpurna vikaas par jor diya, kyonki bharat kii kul aabaadi main yuva jansankhya 65 fisadi he
 He asked the Indian community to help in the proper development of India
 apane bhaashan main modi centre kii samprag sarkaar ke prati zyada aalochanatmak rukh apnaane se bachate najar aae, haalanki, unhone desh ke yuvaaon ke kaushal vikaas ke liye centre or apni aguwai vaali gujarat sarkaar kii ore se aavantit bajet ke mudde par baat kii
 He said, this shows the priorities of both governments
 modi ne kaha, main is manch kaa istemaal kisi sarkaar kii aalochana ke liye nahin kar rahaa, lekin aapke saamne kuch tathy rakhana chahta hum
 In his address, referring to Swami Vivekananda and the youth, Modi said that development is the key to solving all the problems of the country
 apni sarkaar ke vikaas model kii charchaa karte hue modi ne kaha ki desh main maujuud is ‘andhkaar yug’ main gujarat aaj ‘aashaa kii ek kiran’ he
 Modi also made full use of this opportunity to present Gujarat and India as a big tourist destination
 unhone bhartiya samudaay se apil kii ki vah duusare deshon ke nagarikon ko paryaton ke liye bharat aane ko kahen
 Once they start coming to India, it will give a big boost to the country's tourism industry and it will also strengthen the economy
 tippaniyan Modi also called for hotel and motel organizations in America to show India in their room TV sets
 america ke hotel or motal sanghathanon main gujarati mul ke log badi taadaad main hai
 He said, it will be a great service to India from your side
 jaruri nahin he ki hameshaa bharat main nivesh hi kiya jaae yaa dollar bheje jaaen, bharat aane ke liye logon ko prerit karnaa bhi seva kaa ek doosraa rasta he
 TV Asia CEO HR Shah claimed that Modi's speech was seen 'live' by millions of people worldwide
 modi ne kaha, dharmanirpekshata kii meri paribhaasha kaaphi saadhaaran he, ‘pehle bharat’
 Whatever you do, wherever you work, India should be the top priority for all its citizens
 gujarat ke mukhyamantri ne kaha, desh sabhi dharmon evam vichaardhaaraon se upar he
 He said that people should follow this principle

 od-ivan formule ko fail karne ke liye sajeesh kii baat karne vaali kejariwal sarkaar ne ab is masale par you turn le liya he
 The government constituted a three-member committee to investigate this aspect, whose report did not reveal anything of conspiracy
 haalanki dilli sarkaar saath hi fire sarvice ke wo aankade de rahi he, jiske mutabik od-ivan lagu hone ke baad aag kii ghatnaon ke teen guna badhane kaa daawa kiya gaya he
 Conspiracy not found in the report Who set fire to different parts of Delhi? Is this just a conspiracy to fail aud-even? The Kejriwal government of Delhi was saying the same until at least a few days ago, and in order to investigate this theory, the government quickly formed a three-member committee
 cameti ko yun to teen din ke bheetar main hi report deni thi, lekin lag gaye lagbhag saat din
 When the report came, the case turned out to be the Chuhiya Wala of Khoda Pahar
 jo parivahan mantri hafte bhar pehle sajeesh kii baat kar rahe the, report aane ke baad sur badal gaye
 The mcd-delhi government committee on Thursday submitted an eight-page report behind the fire
 report kaa zyaadaatar hissaa kooday ke dher yani land phil site main lagi aag kii baat karata he
 There too, the report of the government was seen talking only on the measures to deal with the fire rather than the conspiracy and the possible causes of the fire there, in which the blame of inefficiency was blamed on the bjp-ruled municipal corporation
 is saal bade aag ke maamlelekin mjedaar baat ye rahi kisarkaarne od-ivan ke dauraan dilli main pichley saal kii tulana main zyada maamalon kii baat to kah di, lekin ye nahin bataaya ki is saal april main saamaanya taur par aag ke maamle bade hai

 world tii20 kaa pehla sanskaran 2007 main khelaa gaya or mahendra singh dhoni kii captaini main team india ne pehali baar main hi champion ban gai
 Since then, this tournament has been played five times
 paanchon baar agal agal timen champion bani he lekin team india ke captain mahendra singh dhoni kaa sikaa yun jamaa hua he ki wo na keval sabase adhik world tii20 maichon main captaini karne vaale cricketer bane hue hai balki unhi ke naam par sabase adhik jeet vaale captain hone kaa tamgaa bhi jadaa hua he
 The record holder is captain Dhoni, who captained India in 62 matches of 20 international cricket, so far he has also led the team in 28 World T20 matches (before the match against New Zealand)
 kisi bhi anya team ke captain se kahin zyada
 Dhoni is followed by former England captain Paul Collingwood who captained his side in 17 matches
 collingwood ke thik peeche is toornament main khel rahi do timen ireland or westeindies ke captain wiliam portfield (15 match) or derren saimi (12 match) bhi 10 se adhik maichon main apni team kii captaini kar chuke hai
 The funny thing is that both of them are also at number two and three respectively, captaining the most matches in international T20 cricket
 jahaan portfield ne 48 maichon main ab tak ireland kii captaini sanbhali he to saimi ne 41 maichon main
 Ireland could not make it to the Super 10 of the tournament
 duusari ore westeindies ke saimi agar yah toornament jeet bhi jate hai to unki captaini main khele gaye maichon kii sankhya adhiktam 18 tak hi pahunch sakegi
 On the other hand, if Dhoni returns without playing the semi-finals this time, the figure of his captaincy record will reach 32 matches
 yani abhi agle kai world tii20 toornaments main dhoni kaa yah record yun hi kaayam rahegaa
 In both wins and losses, it is necessary to mention that India has won 18 matches under Dhoni's captaincy
 yah bhi ek record he
 Dhoni has also lost 9 matches and Ireland captain Portfield equaled him on 13 March
 ye donon world tii20 toornament main sabase adhik match haarane vaale bhi captain hai
 Not only this, Dhoni has also won the toss in the World T20 tournament 16 times so far
 yah bhi ek record hi he
 That is, Dhoni's name is in all the records of captaincy
 dhoni bharat kii ore se sabase adhik world tii20 mukaable khilne vaale cricketer bhi hai
 The funny thing is that he has also captained Team India in all these 28 matches played

 The Shiv Sena is seeing its contribution to Sharad Pawar's candidature as the initiative to unanimously unselect the presidential election
 uske liye sharad pavaar ek aisa naam he jis bahaane vah apana mul agenda chalaa paaegi
 The Shiv Sena is currently seen as the most capable candidate for the presidential election of Sharad Pawar

 Significantly, Shiv Sena party chief Uddhav Thackeray has announced his support for the BJP candidate by attending the recent NDA meeting

 Therefore, Sharad Pawar has reminded that the election of the President is not such that he can get the result only by fighting

 In such a situation, it will also be interesting to see if the Congress will put full force behind Sharad Pawar in the presidential election? is bich sarvasammati ke dhaage ko pakadakar shivasena ne sharad pavaar ko hi sarvasammat ummidavaar ke rup main pesh kiya he
 Shiv Sena leader and Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Raut has told NDTV India that BJP should support Sharad Pawar if there is a consensus on Sharad Pawar's name for the presidency

 Sharad Pawar is a name for her on the pretext that she will be able to run her original agenda

 Sautan gathered a lot of accolades on Monday without going to the audience in the release week
 unhone ramanand sagar or shakti samant ko film dikhaai
 Both of them said that in the climax, both of them take all the credit and you do not appear to be doing anything despite being a superstar
 unhone mujhe apane ghar bulaayaa or do-ek drinks ke baad unhone kaha ki climex seen kaa gaanaa katkar use badal do jisase main super star ke taur par dikhaai duun
 i tried to convince them that they were doing wrong but they insisted and said that they would not go to Delhi on the premiere

 But his performance from Aaradhana (1969)

 The Gujarat High Court has dropped the murder charges against all the 12 accused, rebuking the CBI investigating the 2003 Haren Pandya murder case

 Special Public Prosecutor JM Panchal said that the appeal of the accused has been accepted in part

 Taking a dig at the CBI, the court said that the investigating officer should be held responsible for such mistakes
 isse aropiyon ke khilaaf ninsaphi hui he or sarkari sansaadhan kaa bhi nuksaan hua he
 The court said that the CBI has not been able to prove the murder charges, hence the judgment of the lower court which held these people guilty of murder and criminal conspiracy which does not justify
 iske baad ucch nyaayalay ne nichali adaalat ke aadesh ko khaarij kar diya

 Prior to voting for Lok Sabha elections, Congress President Rahul Gandhi has played a big bet to woo the voters
 darasal, rahul gandhi ne ''nyaay skim'' kaa elaan kiya he jiske jariye desh ke kareeb 5 karod pariwaron ko har saal 72,000 rupee kii madad kar nunatam aay kii guarantee di jaaegi
 According to an estimate, 3 on Rahul Gandhi's plan
 6 lakh karod rupee kharch honge
 This amount is very large, it can solve many big problems
 aaie aaj ham aapako bataate hai ki is rakam se bharat main kya-kya kiya ja saktaa he yaa koun si samasyaayein dur ho sakati thim
 3
 6 lakh karod hota to kisaanon ko milte 30 hajaar rupamodi sarkaar ne antarim bajet main piem kisaan yojana kaa elaan kiya
 An amount of 75000 crores has been approved in the budget for PM Kisan Yojana
 is yojana ke tahat desh ke 12 karod chote or seemaant kisaanon ko 3 kishton main salanaa 6 hajaar rupee diya ja rahaa he
 If Rahul Gandhi's Justice Scheme 3
 6 lakh karod rupee ke anumaanit bajet kii tulana karen to piem kisaan yojana ke bajet se 5 guna zyada he
 In such a situation, it can be said that 12 crore farmers can get 5 times more than 30 thousand rupees against 6 thousand annually
 3
 Had it been 6 lakh crores, there would have been no need for debt from Japan, before 2022, with the help of Japan, the country's first bullet train will run from Mumbai to Ahmedabad
 yah train 508 kimi kaa faasla 3 ghante main tay karegi
 The total cost of this bullet train project 1
 10 lakh karod rupee kii he
 If Rahul Gandhi's justice scheme 3
 6 lakh karod rupee ke anumaanit bajet se tulana karen to is rakam se bharat sarkaar 500 kilometre kii duuri ke kareeb 3 line par bullate train ke project kaa vistaar kar sakati he
 With this, the Indian government will not even have to take a loan from Japan
 bataa den ki 88 hajaar karod rupee kaa karj liya gaya he
 This debt 0
 1% ke byaaj dar par he, jise 50 saal main chukaana padegaa
 3
 6 lakh karod hota to khatm ho jaataa rbi-sarkaar vivadbeete saal rigerv bank of india or bharat sarkaar ke bich vivaad ne khub surkhiyaan batorin
 a very big reason for this whole controversy3
 6 lakh karod rupee kii rakam ko bataai gai
 Indeed, it was claimed in the media report that Sarkar 3
 6 lakh karod kaa fund maang rahi he jo arabiai dene ke paksh main nahin he
 Estimated budget of Rahul Gandhi's justice scheme3
 6 lakh karod rupee kii he
 3
 6 lakh karod hota to ardhsainik balon ko milti puraani pensionbeete kai saalon se desh bhar main ardhsainik balon ko puraani pension yojana ke tahat pension dene kii maang ho rahi he
 Organizations associated with paramilitary forces across the country keep on displaying this
 agar rahul gandhi kii nyaay skim ke bajet se tulana karen to desh ke ardhsainik balon ke liye puraani pension skim lagu ho sakati he
 Explain that during the year 2017-18, a total of 1,56,641 on giving pension
 29 karod rupee kharch kiye gaye hai
 Apart from this, with the help of Rahul Gandhi's scheme, the budget of One Rank, One Pension (OROP) scheme for the Retiring Army can also be increased because under the One Rank, One Pension, the government has so far given 35 thousand to the retired soldiers
 Crores have been given
 3
 6 lakh crores would have doubled the defense budget
 India is currently spending Rs
 3 lakh crores on the defense sector, even in situations of tension with Pakistan and China
 agar rahul gandhi kii nyaay skim kii anumaanit bajet ko aavantit kiya jaae to dephence sector kaa bajet doguna ho saktaa he
 With this, India will become stronger in defense sector
 bataa den ki duniya bhar ke deshon kii ore se raksha bajet par kharch kii jane vaali raashi main 36 fisadi hissaa america kaa he jabaki china kaa 13 fisadi he
 Currently ahead of India, the US, China, Russia and Saudi Arabia are

 During this treatment, Lalita Pawar's right body was paralyzed as a result of any wrong medicine given by the doctor

 ye kahana he jaipur ke neendad gaanv ke kisaanon kaa
 Whether the elders, the young and the women, the farmers of this village have been sitting for land for the last 4 days
 jameen samadhi ke liye inkaa puraa sharir gaddhon ke andar he, bas sir hi sir baahar he
 Farmers started this unique movement of their kind to save land from Gandhi Jayanti (2 October)
 darasal, jaipur vikaas praadhikaran (jedie) ne is gaanv kekisaanon ko jameen khalikarne ke liye notice thama rakhe hai
 The government says that about 1350 bighas of land have been acquired in 2010 to build the colony
 vahiin kisaanon kaa kahana he ki sarkaar unki jameen ko oonche daamon par bechakar colony basaanaa chaahati he
 The government has started the process of eviction by depositing the compensation of the farmers who did not take compensation of the land in the court
 sarkaar kaa kahana he ki kisaan court me jamaa muaavja le len aurajameen khaali kar den
 On the matter of compensation, the farmers say that every farmer has some land for his own living, how can the government take it from him
 kisaanon ke mutabik jameen dene se acha he ki wo khud hi jameen main rah kar apni jaan de den
 The government is on the back foot in view of this farmers' movement
 sarkaar kii ore se kisaanon se kaha ja rahaa he ki wo baatcheet ke liye aage aaen
 At the same time, farmers say that there is no question of dialogue
 sarkaar yadi kisaanon kaa vaaki hit chaahati he to unki jameen nahin lene kaa elaan karen
 If this does not happen, the farmers will give up their lives by staying in pits but will not let their land go
 bataa den ki rajasthan sarkaar kaa jaipur vikaas praadhikaran bhi mandi kii chapet main he
 When the property market closed, the development work was stalled
 iske liye dhan chahie to kisaanon kii jameen lekar plot katkar bechney kii yojana banaai gai
 But the farmers of Nodar have stood firm against this move of JDA
 neendad ke jeevat ram
 He is almost 78 years old, but at this stage of his age, he is sitting in a pit to save his land
 unke do padpote hai, or nau pote hai, ek betaa viklang he
 Jeevat Ram says that he grew up in this land, he cannot even think of separating from it
 isi par mar jaaenge lekin ise alag nahin hone denge
 Similarly, tears come to the eyes of 80-year-old Dhapo while talking about the land
 gauratlab he ki sarkaar ne 2010 main hi kisaanon kii jameen par colony banane kii yojana banaai thi lekin ab jaakar kisaanon ko jameen sarender karne ke liye notice thamaaye hai
 In protest against this, farmers are protesting on the land adjacent to Jaipur Sikar Highway
 kisaanon main itnaa gussa he ki colony kii yojana ke tahat jo sadak banaai, use bhi ukhaad phenkaa
 The government has also threatened to sue him

 — taran adarsh (@taran_adarsh)july 13, 2016 Five years ago, Kaluvas, a village in Haryana, was recognized overnight because a star emerged from here and swept across the world
 us star kaa naam he vijender singh
 The same boxer Vijender Singh, who is surrounded by allegations of being involved in the drugs smuggling scandal day by day
 2008 ke olympic main medal jhatakkar vijender singh ne tahalaka machaa diya tha
 Then this village (kaluvas) came into the limelight
 vijender singh ne kuch bada karke dikhaane kaa jo sapana paala tha, use paa bhi liya
 But these days, Vijender's link with drug trafficking accused has tarnished his image
 mail today ne mangalvaar ko kaluwas gaanv kaa daura kiya
 Everything here was the same as it used to be
 gaanv ke jawan yuvak taash khel rahe the to bujurgon kii chaoupal bhi usee tarah jami thi, jaise aam dinon main jamati he
 Everyday work was also going on
 vijender ke shandaar ghar ke baahar unki maa khadi thim
 She hesitated when Mail Today wanted to talk to them
 kuch der baad ve baat karne ko taiyaar ho gayi
 She agreed to tell what was going on her and her family in the last few days
 mukkebaaz vijender singh kii maa krishna devi ne apane bete kaa puraa samarthan karte hue kaha ki parivaar in dinon kaaphi maansik pareshaani jhel rahaa he
 The drugs controversy has tarnished not only Vijender, but his family as a whole
 krishna devi ne bataaya, 'gaanv ke log haalanki parivaar kii bahut izzat karte hai or dil se ve hamaare saath hai, phir bhi unhen ghar se baahar nikalnaa bhi ab ajeeb sa lagane laga he
 We believe Vijender is not wrong, but still being a member of the family, there remains a burden on the mind in front of the people
 ' drugs taskari vivaad main vijender kaa naam tab saamne aayaa, jab unki patni ke naam registerd gaadi enarai anup singh kahlon, jo drugs taskari kaa mukhya aaropee he, ke flats ke baahar mili thi or isamen kaaphi maatra main heroin bhi baraamad hui
 Kahlas have been arrested
 vijender ke liye mushkilen tab or bad gayi jab unke hi dost ram singh ne yah kaha ki donon (ram singh or vijender) ne ek saath heroin lee thi
 The Punjab Police asked Vijender for samples of his blood and hair, but Vijender refused it
 krishna devi ko bharosa he ki kuch samay beshak lagegaa, lekin unka betaa paak saaf nikalegaa
 His mother said, Vijender is being framed because he is a star and his image is very clear
 ummid he ki vah jald khud kii nirdoshita sabit kar degaa
 The news that Vijender Singh was named drug traffickers shocked fans as well as the people of his village
 kaluwas gaanv ke hi ek nivasee subhash singh ne bataaya ki vijender ke bare main us khabar se hamen shock laga
 We have never seen Vijender or any of his family members smoking, far from talking about drugs
 itnaa bada khilaadi or saaf chhavi kaa vijender drugs legaa, yah hamaari soch se baahar he
 Another villager Hazari Singh said that he has been playing well for a decade and it is unfortunate to get involved in this controversy
 vah itane samay se neshnal team main he, yadi vah doping karata hota to kab kaa pakadaa ja chukaa hoga
 However, some people said in a suppressed voice that whatever it is, Vijender must prove his innocence
 ek gaanvvasi ne naam na chhapane kii shart par kaha ki ham jaanate hai ki vijender kaaphi izzat vaala insaan he
 He respects every person in the village
 lekin ham is aadhaar par uski chhavi nirdhaarit nahin kar sakate
 He also has a life outside the village
 agar vah nirdosh he to use saamne aana chahie or ise sabit karnaa chahie
 President's rule was imposed on Tuesday after an 18-day tussle over government formation in Maharashtra
 bijepi or shivasena ke baad rajyapal bhagat singh koshyari ne ensipi ko sarkaar banane kaa nyotaa diya tha, lekin usase pehle hi rajya main raashtrapati shashan lagu kar diya gaya
 According to Home Ministry officials, the NCP had approached the governor on Tuesday morning and sought 3 days to form the government
 haalanki rajyapal kaa mat tha ki koi bhi party aise sthiti main nahin he ki vah sarkaar bana sake
 pic
 twitter
 com / 9jrlzvf7zk— Bhagat Singh Koshyari (@bskoshyari) November 12, 2019 According to the ministry, the governor said in his report that elections were held 15 days, but no party appeared to be in a position to form the government
 ensipi ne kaha-3 din or chahierajbhavan ne ensipi ko mangalvaar shaam 8:30 baje tak sarkaar banane kaa samarthan jutaney kii baat kahi or letters dene kii baat kahi thi
 Before that, why did the NCP go to Raj Bhavan in the day and say that it needs 3 days time
 grih mantralay sutron ne ye jaankaree di he ki ensipi ne aisa letters rajbhavan ko diya
 After that the Governor of Maharashtra made his full report and sent it to the Central Government
 iske baad centre sarkaar ne cabinet meeting bulaai or raashtrapati shashan kii sifarish kii
 Meanwhile, NCP leader Nawab Malik was seen saying that he has majority, he should be given time
 jab governor ne shaam 8:30 baje tak kaa samay diya tha to aakhir ensipi ne kyon governor house ko likhakar diya ki unhen 3 din kaa samay diya janaa chahie
 The Home Ministry said that the Governor's report says that even after every possible effort from his side, the formation of the Government of Maharashtra is not visible as per the Constitution
 aise main rajyapal ke paas raashtrapati shashan kii sifarish karne ke alaava koi doosraa vikalp nahin he
 He made this recommendation according to Article 356 of the Constitution
 grih mantralay ne apane bayaan main kya kahagrih mantralay ne apane bayaan main kaha ki maharashtra ke rajyapal kaa maananaa tha ki chunavi prakriya samaapt hue 15 ho gaye hai or koi bhi raajnneetik dal sarkaar banane kii sthiti main nahin he, isliye rajya main raashtrapati shashan lagaana behatar hoga
 Earlier on Sunday, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had said that it would not form a government in Maharashtra given the stand of its alliance partner Shiv Sena
 288 sadasyeey vidhansabha main, bhaajapa 105 seat jitkar sabase badi party banakar ubhari thi or vah shivasena ke saath aasaani se sarkaar banane kii sthiti main thi, lekin 56 sadasyon vaali shivasena ne mukhyamantri pad ko lekar matbhed kii vajah se bhaajapa kaa saath dene se inkaar kar diya tha
 Since then, Shiv Sena has tried to form the government with the help of Congress and NCP
 rajyapal ne sabase pehle bhaajapa ko sarkaar gathan ke liye aamantrit kiya tha, uske baad unhone ravivaar ko shivasena ko aamantrit kiya
 The Shiv Sena, however, could not get enough MLA support in the 24-hour deadline
 uske baad koshyari ne somvaar shaam ko rakanpa ko sarkaar banane ke liye aamantrit kiya or samarthan darshane ke liye mangalvaar raat 8 baje tak kaa samay diya tha, haalanki usase pehle hi rajya main raashtrapati shashan laga diya gaya
 Shiv Senasinhivasena, who reached the Supreme Court on the Governor's decision, has approached the Supreme Court for hearing against the decision of the Governor of Maharashtra
 shivasena ne sarkaar banane ke liye rajyapal dwaara rakanpa va congress se samarthan patr lene ke liye teen din kaa samay nahin die jane ko lekar supreme court kaa rukh kiya he
 The registry of the apex court is yet to be approved by the Chief Justice, so that the case can be listed
 bataa den ki shivasena rajya main congress or rashtravaadi congress party (rakanpa) ke samarthan se gathbandhan sarkaar banane kaa prayaas kar rahi he lekin vah donon dalon se samarthan patr praapt karne main vifal rahi he
 Maharashtra Governor's move inspired by politics: The Congress Congress termed Maharashtra Governor BS Koshyari's move to recommend President's rule in the state as politically motivated
 party ne kaha ki rajyapal ne aamantrit dalon ko paryaapt samay nahin diya or sabhi dalon ko aamantrit karne ke baavjood unhone congress ko sarkaar banane kaa aamantran nahin diya
 Congress's chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala said in a tweet, 'governor Koshyari has insulted democracy in Maharashtra and has mocked the constitutional process by recommending President's rule
 'unhone kaha, 'maharashtra main akeli sabase badi party kii anupasthiti main, rajyapal ko pehle sabase bade chunaav purv gathbandhan bhaajapa-shivasena ko ekasaath or uske baad duusare sabase bade gathbandhan congress-rakanpa ko bulaanaa chahie tha
 Surjewala also questioned the governor for not inviting the Congress
 unhone kaha, 'agar rajyapal ne vyaktigat dalon ko bulaayaa bhi, to unhone congress ko kyon nahin bulaayaa? raashtrapati shashan lagane se pehle samay dene main gadabadi kyon kii gai
 48 hours for BJP, 24 hours for Shiv Sena and 24 hours for NCP

 Now think that when there will be half the teachers in any school, how will the education be good

 In all, the positions of 6 thousand teachers are vacant in the three mcds
 bijepi, congress or aam aadmi party jab emsidi chunaavon ke dauraan apni uplabdhiyon ko ginane main lage hai usee vakt dilli sarkaar or emsidi ko shikshakon kii niyukti par hai court ne fatkaar lagaai he
 The court has also ordered the formation of a committee in this matter which will tell the court how to start the process of appointment and how the process can be ended at the earliest
 hai court is baat se behad naaraaz tha ki pichley kai adeshon ke baad bhi ab tak shikshakon kii niyukti ke maamle ko sarkaar ne gambhirtha se nahin liya jo ki sidhe taur par bacchon ke bhavishya se khilwaad he

 2008 me court ne shikshakon kii niyakti ke aadesh bhi de die lekin 9 saal bitne ke baad bhihalaat sudharne ke bajaay badtarahi hue hai
 Even the poorest of the poor people do not want to admit their children here after seeing the condition of government schools
 court ke is aadesh ke baad ek baar phir ummid jaagi he ki sarkari skulon main pard rahe bacchon ko skulon main shikshakon kii kami ke chalate padhai kaa nuksaan nahin jhelana padegaa
 If the court order and the committee's recommendations are implemented soon, it is possible that the shortage of teachers in government schools will be completed by the next session

 Born on December 9, 1929 in Lucknow and died in Delhi on December 30, 1990
 is samay ke bich raghuveer sahay ne kya-kya nahin likhaa
 He was a great creator
 sahitya or patrakarita ko ek saath saadhane vaale adbhut lekhak
 Raghuvir Sahai's compositions are a living document of the beats of modern times
 unhone lekh ke alaava kavita, kahani, niabandh sabhi likhe or in sabamein unke tevar ke kya kehane
 Raghuveer Sahay started writing literature and doing journalism even before doing his MA in English literature from Lucknow University in 1949

 He got a job here, and also married here
 patni or pahchaan ke saath-saath yaheen vah samakaleen hindi kavita ke mahatvapurn stambh bane
 Alam was that sometimes journalism would come in his literature, sometimes literature would dominate his journalism

 ek aisa bharat jo aage badhane ke saath hi gaiyr barabari, anyaay or sabal varg kii ek nae tarah kii gulaami se jujh rahaa tha
 That is why the goal of his entire poetry journey was to create a democratic system in which there is no discrimination due to hunger, exploitation, injustice, murder, suicide, inequality, slavery, political sovereignty, caste, religion, sect, gender
 vah chaahate the ki jin aashaaon or sapanom se azaadi kii ladaai ladi gai thi, unhen saakaar kiya jaae
 As a journalist, editor, he had a close look at the dual faces and character of politicians and the ruling class
 is vishay ko lekar likhi unki kavita ‘aapaki hansi’ aaj bhi behad maujuun he
 You should see for yourself: exploiting the poor people by saying that you are laughing at the last moment of the democracy, all of you are laughing, you are laughable, you are laughing at me and how much you will be safe
 As a reporter, editor, critic and culture writer, the issues, topics that have been touched on by then in the literary world Was shown
 unhone aam aadmi kii pidaa apane andaaj main zaahir kii
 Through the 36 poems of his compilation 'against Suicide', he portrayed human duality and greed very well
 raghuveer sahay bahut bade or lambey samay tak yaad rakhe jane vaale kavi hai
 He went beyond the poems often written in literature about loneliness and loneliness, and touched on issues that were directly related to life and liveliness
 sahay keval raajnneeti par kataaksh karne vaale kavi nahin the
 His poems were clearly visible in journalistic attitude and news experience

 Muktibodh, Shamsher along with Raghuveer were among the top three names of that era
 par in teenon kii apni-apni khaasiyaten thim
 While Gajanan Madhav Muktibodh was known for weaving fantasies and Shamsher Bahadur Singh for singing his poetry, Raghuveer Sahay was popular for his subject, language and craft
 stri vimarsh ke bare main likhi ‘nari’ naamak kavita main isaki baangi dekhiehnari bichaari hapurush kii maari hethan se kshudhit haiman se mudit helpak kar jhapak karant main chit haiyah achraj kii baat nahin ki raajakmal prakaashan ne 6 khandon main jab raghuveer sahay rachanawali chhaapi to uskaa parichay dete hue likhaa, ‘chah khandon main prakashit unki rachanawali main aaj kaa samay sampoornataa main paribhaashit hua he
 Raghuveer Sahay is one of the class creators due to his unique creativity, whose relevance increases with the passage of time
 apane nae kathy or shilp ke kaaran raghuveer sahay ne hindi kavita ko nayaa rup diya
 'such people and their poems are always classy
 unhen rachanaaon kii ginati or unki lokapriyata se zyada unki praasangikta se aanka janaa chahie, or raghuveer sahay is kasuti par khare hai

 Fans have been trolling Rohit Sharma, the batsman of Team India, who performed extremely poorly in the Test series against South Africa
 darasal, rohit sharma ko maujuuda test siries main ajinkya rahane par tarjeeh di ja rahi he, iske baavjood ab tak vah teen test pariyon main sirf 31 ran hi bana paae hai
 In which his best score is 11 runs
 bataa den ki rohit sharma kaa gharelu maidan or videshi dharti par ballebaaji pradarshan main 60
 There is a difference of an average of 89, the most disappointing performance by any batsman in the world
 rohit ke is kharaab pradarshan ke baavjood unhen captain kohli lagaataar maukey de rahe hai, jisase aahat phens ne 'hitman' ko nishane par le liya he
 One user commented on Rohit Sharma, saying that only two Rohit Sharma can play the next Test match in Surat, if he tells Captain Kohli that this will be my last Test match or Rohit gives a good performance in the second innings
 Rohit sharma will play 3rd test match in only 2 condition
 1
 If rohit tells virat that this is my last test match2
 If rohit play a match winning knock in 2nd innings # savind # indvsa # savsindrt if you agree— Mycricweb (@mycricweb) January 14, 2018 Also many fans have tweeted a lot opposing Rohit Sharma being replaced by Ajinkya Rahane 
 I'm More Concerned If Somehow Rohit Sharma Manage To Score In This Match We Might Lose a Gem Of a Test Match Batsman Like Ajinkya Rahane
 🙄😯😫 # indvsa # indvssa # savind # savsind — Sir Ravindra Jadeja (@sirjadeja) January 14, 2018 @ iamkohlirohit sharma is a oneday player and flopped several times in test
 Many times dropped and recalled in test, Playing for 10 yrs still not permanent test player
 How many times you guys will try Rohit in test !!! - Abhishek Singh (@ Singhabhi_07) January 14, 2018plz give me 4 innings, i can score more than Rohit Sharma with better strike rates
 
 
 # deal— Janak Desai (@jnd583)january 14, 2018to all Rohit Sharma fans
 Face the fact that he is an overrated flat track bully
 And to all Kohli critics
 Determination wins over talent
 Every day!every time!every Which way!— Ravishankar v (@raviveeraghanta)january 14, 2018 Sisodia announced the proposal placed in the CABE meeting
 He said- New education policy points towards the formation of a private education board
 Education Minister Manish Sisodia in the Delhi government has announced the proposal placed in the CABE meeting
 unhone bataaya ki baithak main shiksha niti se jude mukhya 3 muddon par charchaa hui
 During this, Sisodia said that very little is spent on education in India
 unhone kaha ki rajya or centre ke ayog honge, council hongi, isse shiksha ayog main funs jaaegi
 But what will be the road map ahead? Sisodia said that today i have proposed that a law should be made in which central and state governments should keep 6% of GDP for the education budget
 unhone kaha ki shiksha dena sarkaar kii jimmedaari honi chahie
 But many rules of national education policy promote private school
 sisodiya ne kaha, 'nai shiksha policy privet shiksha board banane kii taraf ishaara karti he
 i have opposed the private board
 privet board se shiksha kii gunvattta par asar padegaa, har koi apane skool kii chaiyn bana legaa jo sahi nahin hoga
 He said that fake degree is the biggest challenge in the country
 phek degree ko rokane ke liye koi hal nahin he
 In the new education policy every college has the right to grant degrees, which should not be given
 saath hi sisodiya ne kaha ki desh ke saare institute ko multi faikalti bananaa ek galat edia he
 It is necessary to give government education, but it will not be right to create a private board
 “A Good deed is the best Prayer”

 In the group to which SRP Kalluri sent the message, there are some police officers and people from self-styled organizations like Agni, who have been questioned

 Kalluri was made IG of Bastar in July 2014 and since then several Naxalites surrendered in Bastar

 NDTV India had proved itself by visiting villages in Bastar that many surrenders were fake

 " somvaar ko dilli waalon ne dohari musiibat jheli
 On one hand, mercury went down due to increasing cold, on the other hand, due to pollution and fog, visibility was reduced on Monday morning
 saath hi logon ko saans lene main dikkat bhi hone lagi
 This happened because the amount of smog in the sky has increased
 hawa rukii to bad gaya pradooshandilli ke mausam vibhaag main senior scientist kuldeep shrivastav kaa kahana he ki somvaar subah dilli main hawaaon kii raftaar bilkul tham gai thi
 Due to this, the pollution in the air combined with the fog became a dangerous smog
 jisaki vajah se ek taraf visibility 300 meter tak pahunch gai to vahiin duusari ore logon ko saans lene main bhi dikkat kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 The speed of the air has stopped, Shrivastava further said that the situation is going to remain exactly like this for the next 2 to 3 days because the wind speed has stopped
 haalanki, isse ek phayda he ki taapmaana main thodi si badhotaree hui he
 Minimum temperature has increased by 1 degree on Monday compared to Sunday
 26 disambar se dobaaraa badhegi thand or kohradarasal, barfili hawa chalate hi dilli ko apni jakad main le legi or christmas ke agle din yani 26 disambar se iskaa prabhaav dilli main saaf taur par najar aane lagegaa
 Temperature will go down due to cold air moving
 vahiin, duusari ore koharaa bhi badhegaa
 Because of this, the feeling of cold will be more
 aise main mana ja saktaa he ki nae saal kii shuruyaat dilli main kanpakanpati sardi or ghaney kohre ke bich hogi
 The picture of unity in Samajwadi Party (SP) after the debacle in the Lok Sabha elections is currently looking blurred
 nateezon ke baad aisa lag rahaa tha ki chachaa-bhatija parivaar or party bachaane ke liye phir ek honge, lekin ab yah baat bedam lagane lagi he
 After losing two consecutive Lok Sabha elections and one assembly election, pressure has increased on Akhilesh to reunite the family
 khaskar sapa sansthaapak mulaayam sih yadav chaahate hai ki party ko khadaa karne main yogadan dene vaale chote bhai shivpal sih yadav ko dobaaraa saath laayaa jaae
 But Akhilesh is not ready
 unhen lagata he ki shivpal kii antry se party main unke ekadhikaar or varchasv ko khatra paidaa ho jayega
 Those close to Akhilesh believe that the SP president does not want many centers of power once again in the party
 shivpal ke aane se isaki sambhaavna kai guna bad jaaegi
 There have also been some personal talks that Akhilesh is not able to remove the bitterness about Shivpal
 loksabhaa chunaav main sapa-basapa-ralod gathbandhan ke parajeet hone ke baad se samaajawaadee netaaon ko ek manch par laane ke prayaas kiye ja rahe hai
 Sources say that in separate talks with prominent leaders, Mulayam Singh Yadav has expressed his desire to create an alternative to BJP by bringing old workers on one platform
 raajnneetik vishleshak ratanmani laal kaa kahana he ki "shivpal kii ore se koi hichak nahin he
 He feels that due to his seniority, if he goes to the party now, he will get a big post
 shivpal alag party banaakar apni himmat dikhaa chuke hai
 Therefore, his ability can also be doubted
 akhilesh or mulaayam donon jaanate hai ki sapa ko yahaan pahunchane main unka bada haath he
 "he said," Shivpal knows what his role will be in the party this time
 vah apni party kaa vilay apni shatren par hi karenge
 Right now an attempt is being made to convince him
 vah jaanate hai ki unka vah aparhand hai
 He wants to take credit that Shivpal can salvage the party that Mulayam created and Akhilesh sinks
 isliye isamen shivpal ko dikkat nahin he
 Akhilesh will face problems
 "gauratlab he ki shivpal pichley saal sapa se alag ho gaye the or unhone apni alag party bana lee thi
 However, interestingly, Shivpal Yadav is still an MLA from SP
 iske baavjood shivpal kii sadsyta ke samaapt karne ke liye sapa alaakaman kii ore se aaj tak kisi tarah kii koi chitthee nahin likhi gai he
 Whereas he himself was in the fray in the Lok Sabha elections against SP and fielded several leaders from his party in separate seats
 isliye sapa ne abhi sulah kii kuch bahut gunjaaish bana rakhi he
 But the head of the Progressive Samajwadi Party, Shivpal Singh Yadav, has refused to return to the SP
 haalanki unhone gathbandhan kii sambhaavna banaae rakhi he
 After a review meeting of the district and city presidents of Praspa at his residence, he claimed to have restructured the organization and brought Praspa to the main contest in the 2022 assembly elections
 shivpal kaa kahana he ki loksabhaa chunaav kii taiyaari ke liye paryaapt samay nahin mil paane ke kaaran apekshit nattejey praapt nahin ho sake
 Praspa spokesperson Deepak Mishra says that after coalition politics proved to be a failure, the public eye is on Praspa
 khud prasapa supremeo shivpal yadav bhi samaajawaadee party main ghar vaapasi kii charchaa ko viraam laga chuke hai
 You must have heard the name of Amarbel
 amarbel jis ped par hoti he

 The uproar over Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav's resignation is the result of Lalu Yadav's greed to collect substantial assets that his most promising political successor has been caught in the corruption net early in his political career

 The lineage of Indian politics is very rich, but like Tejashwi no one has faced the attacks of opposition like the corruption of his father

 When the Nitish Kumar government launched a pension scheme for those jailed during Jayaprakash Narayan's Sampoorna Kranti agitation in 2007, no one thought that it could be implemented in the true sense
 1974 ke isi sampurna kranti andolan ne 1977 main indira gandhi kii sarkaar giraayi thi
 There were several reasons to doubt the implementation of the plan
 andolan ko khatm hue 30 saal se zyada biit chuke the or pension ke bahut se asli hakdaar rajya chhodkar kahin or ja chuke the
 Particularly, the real claimants could be identified only on the basis of jail records and many jails were missing these records
 itnaa hi nahin bahut se aise daavedaar the jinka koi record nahin tha lekin bihar ke bade netaaon se kareebi jaan-pahchaan thi
 These leaders were also imprisoned during the entire revolution movement

 During that time, some jailed leaders are now ministers in Bihar
 yah baat digar he ki kisi bade netaa ne pension ke liye aavedan nahin kiya tha
 Subhani says, "the pension was to be paid from the government treasury, so strong evidence was required for every claim
 ” kuch jail record kate-fate or dimak ke khaae hue the jinhen padhaa nahin ja saktaa tha
 Some jails like Khagadiya did not have old records because they were swept away by the floods

 Angela rushed to the dentist with her child and was hopeful that her son would not have any dental problems
 ek jimmedaar maa kii tarah angela apane bacchon kii sehat ko lekar hameshaa hi satark rahati thim
 She felt that she also takes full care of her teeth
 wo apane bacchon ko khaane-pine kii har us cheez se dur rakhti thim jo unhen nuksaan pahunchaa sakate the
 But when the dentist told them that Finn was cavity in Kedudh's teeth, Angela was surprised
 is cavity ko bane kareeb chah maheene ho chuke the
 Angela says that she thought she was the world's worst mother
 par us vakt bhi unhen ye nahin pataa chal kii unke bete ko ye takalif ho kaise gai
 According to him, his children neither eat too much junk food nor do they wash their mouth after eating something sweet
 phir ye hua kaise?british dental association ke scientific adwiser professor demin walmsle kaa kahana he ki aajkal ke bachche snacks ko lekar kuch zyada hi utsaahi hote hai,jisaki vajah se unamem cavity hone kaa khatra bahut adhik hota he
 Researchers believe that many times, due to excessive care by parents, the teeth of children also get spoiled
 unhen lagata he ki unke bachche ko healdi drink pinaa chahie, yugart or duusare drink lene chahie
 But they forget that they all contain a lot of sugar, which affects the baby's teeth very badly
 bacchon ke daant do tareeke se prabhavit hote hai
 One is the intake of foods which have acidosis and the other which contain sugar
 amleey khaadya padaarth daanton kii upree parat yani inemal ko nasht karata he jabaki sugar bacteria ko janm detaa he
 The same thing happened in Angela's case
 angela apane bacchon ko paushtik aahaar dene ke chakkar main zeus, hani-grain baar diya karti thim
 She used to feed her children at night only by feeding them milk
 unhen lagata tha ki calcium unke bacchon ke daant ke liye bahut acha he
 But as Dr
 Nathwani says that milk is good during the day, but at night, the lactose present in it, which is a type of sugar, damages the teeth
 zyaadaatar maa-baap ko yahi lagata he ki raat ko doodh pinaa unke bacchon ke liye bahut phydemand hoga lekin ye baat kuch hi maa-baap ko pataa hoti he ki galat vakt par bachche ko doodh dena unke daanton ko majboot banane kii jagah or kamjor hi karenga

 Stories of tigers, lions and leopards are often seen on social media
 kai baar ye dil ko chhu jaati he or kai baar dil ko dahala jaati hai
 Recently, pictures and videos related to the violent attacks of tigers caught the attention of social media users
 kuch aise daawey saamne aae ki ye vibhats tasviren odisha ke daringbadi kii he
 Warangal in Chandauli district of Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and Telangana were also involved in the claims made by internet users regarding the location of these pictures
 india today fact check ne paaya ki ye tasviren or video puraani hai, isliye inase jude jo daawey kiye gaye hai wo jhuthe hai
 In all the viral posts, the video of the terrorists attacking the tigers is being shared on various whatsapp groups and it is claimed that the incident happened during a party in Daringbadi
 is video main dekha ja saktaa he ki ek shaks par do se teen baagh buree tarah se hamalaa kar rahe hai
 In the video, shouts are heard of frightened people who are trying to save the person from a distance
 video main ye log baaghon ko bhagane ke liye awaz vaale pataakhe bhi unki taraf daagate dekhte ja sakate hai
 When we searched for the incident of the recent tiger attack in Daringbadi, a report dated 13 January 2019 was found in Odishapost
com stating that no such attack occurred in the Daringbadi area recently
 report main forest ranger (van rakshak) ke hawaale se ye bhi daawa kiya gaya ki sthaneey logon ne aisi tasviren or video isliye circulet kii taaki chhuttiyaan manaane ke liye aane vaale sailaani is kshetra se dur rahen
 The Navbharat Times also covered the news and termed it a 'rumor'
 isamen soshal media ke ek yujar ke hawaale se ye bhi bataaya gaya ki ye video china ke ek chidyaghar kaa he
 We searched youtube on the incident of tiger attack in China's zoo and found this video on staronline
 isamen bataaya gaya ki purvi china ke yongore chidyaghar main june 2017 main ek shaks ko baagh ne maar daalaa tha
 The man entered the lion's enclosure to avoid paying the ticket

 He claimed that the leopard attack happened in Chiplun, Maharashtra

 hamane thik us jagah ko bhi dhund liya jahaan tendua sadak par leta tha or aasapaas motorbikes dikh rahi thim
 India Today came to the conclusion that these pictures and videos are not only old and misleading but they are different incidents in different places
 isse pehle darjanon kii sankhya main yuvakon ne patna hawaondde par hardik kii agavaani kii or unke samarthan main naare lagaae
 Hardik had last visited Patna in December 2016 when he went directly from Patna airport to Chief Minister Nitish's official residence
 tab rajya sarkaar ne unhen viipi satkar diya tha
 But this time the situation is different
