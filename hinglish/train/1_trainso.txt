 There is no reason for me to lie that i spoke to martyr ATS chief Hemant Karkare
 ’ madhya pradesh ke purv mukhyamantri ne somvaar ko daawa kiya tha ki unke paas ye record hai ki karkare ne unase baat kii thi

 This is not a new thing
 maine electronic media or print media se kai baar yah baat kahi he
 He also completely dismissed as "absurd" that he was questioning the investigation in the Mumbai attacks case or that he meant that Pakistani terrorists were not involved in Karkare's death

 He said, 'I have no doubt about the involvement of Pakistani terrorists in Mumbai attacks

 unhone kaha, ‘mahant mere puraane mitra hai
 They should not make such rhetoric
 ’bhaajapa ko aade haath lete hue singh ne kaha ki ghatana ke turant baad tatkaaleen rajyapal julio rabero ne yah bhi kaha tha ki karkare ne unase mumbai hamalon se kuch din pehle mulaakaat kii thi
 Singh said Karkare had told Rebero that he was saddened by senior BJP leaders LK Advani, Rajnath Singh and some Hindu organizations for 'making baseless accusations and questioning their honesty'
 unhone kaha, ‘main bhaajapa se yah poochna chahta hum ki adwani or rajnath singh ko karkare kii eemaandaaree par sawaal uthaane kaa kya adhikaar tha
 Was this act of the former home minister of the country not an attempt to influence the investigation and discourage Karkare
 ’ Questions are being raised on the board's examination system across the country due to the leak of the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) Class 10 Mathematics and Class 12 Economics question papers
 aise main sibiesai ke purv adhyaksh ashok ganguli ne is bare main 'bhashaa news agency ke paanch sawaal' shrinkhalaa main apni raay vyakt kii
 question 1
 kendriya madhyamik shiksha board 'sibiesai' kii 10veen evam 12veen kaksha kii pariksha main prashnptr li hone kii ghatana ko kis tarah se dekhte hai?uttar: sibiesai kii pariksha pranali bahut vishisht rahi he or iske baavjood prashnptr li hona chintajanak baat he kyonki isse prakaashan yaa collection centre str kii suraksha vyavastha sawaalon ke ghere main aa jaati he
 In such a situation, the examination system needs to be examined on a large scale
 prashn 2
 What could be the reasons for this lapse? Do you consider this to be a violation of established procedures? Answer: CBSE has mastered the conduct of examinations, but the occurrence of the question paper leaks suggests that the system is suffering from negligence
 sibiesai ne aisi pariksha ke liye kai prashnpatron kaa set taiyaar karne kii ek vyavastha taiyaar kii thi
 The first set of question papers varied by region
 kuch rajya board ne is pranali ko apanaaya he
 But after some time, CBSE abandoned the system of preparing multiple sets of several question papers
 agar ham multiple set aadhaarit prashnpatron kii vyavastha ko jari rakhte tab li jaisi ghatana kaa asar kam hota, tab puure desh main dobaaraa pariksha lene kii jarurat nahin hoti
 Question 3
 kya prakriya main koi khami aa gai he? agar haa, to tatkaal kya kadam uthaae jane kii jarurat he?uttar: kuch saalon main chaatro kii sankhya kaaphi badi he, us hisaab se nae pariksha centre bane hai
 The board will have to investigate these centers, or else such incidents can happen again and again
 jab aap is tarah kii badi pariksha kaa prabandhan karte hai to aapke paas plan bi or plan si taiyaar rahanaa chahie
 We have to prepare an arrangement for examining the set of sealed question papers at the examination center which includes a supervisor of CBSE
 ise bhi padhein: rajasthan main guruon kaa ghotaalaa, uniwarsity paperli maamle main 9 arestaprashn 4
 How do you see the proposal to electronically send and print the question paper at the examination center? Answer: In view of the wide geographical spread and settlement of the country, the proposal of sending the question paper in electronic form and then printing there does not seem practical
 
 prashn 5
 Question paper leak case how much harm to school education? Answer: Unhealthy competition is causing adverse effects on society
 yah ghatana is aswasthkar pratispardhaa kaa udhaaharan he jahaan kuch tatwon ne prashnptr li kiya, lekin iskaa nuksaan chaatro ko hi hota he
 Also read: Examination postponed due to leak of paper, students vandalized in VC office that former president of CBSE Ashok Ganguly has expressed concern over the question paper leaking as questions of the education system are being questioned due to the leak of paper
 saath hi nae pariksha kendron kii board ko jaanch kerani hogi or silband prashnpatron ke set kii pariksha centre par jaanch ke liye ek vyavastha taiyaar kerani hogi jisamen sibiesai kaa ek paryvekshak shaamil ho
 Otherwise such incidents can happen again and again
 paper li hone kaa sabase zyada asar chaatro par hi hota he

 mere hisaab se feminism yah he ki har aurat ko ek aurat hone kaa haq mili or kahin se bhi kamatar hone kaa ehsaas na ho
 Most of the time it is said to women that if you are a special kind of person then only you will be called a good woman
 'unhone kaha, 'sabase pahal hamen yah pahchaanana chahie ham kya hai
 What does our gender want from us? There is some difference biologically
 durbhaagya se ham ise nahin samajhate
 It is not just an issue of men's thinking
 feminism kaa matlab yah he ki aurat kisi aurat ke bare main sahaj ho
 'see the full coverage of Sahitya Aaj Tak here
 Let the Narcissist understand the Lesbian writer Meghna Pant said,' i felt in 2013 that i am a Feminist and people told me that i should not look like a Feminist
 main lesbian nahin hum
 i do not stay angry

 It took me a long time to understand what Feminism is
 hamane saal 2018 main kitaab likhaa 'feminist rani'
 Unfortunately people consider Feminism a wrong term
 log ise mardon ke khilaaf samajhate hai
 Literature Aaj Tak 2019 started with Suryakant Tripathi Nirala's Vani Vandana, people do not understand even in places like Kerala, Malayalam writer KR Meera told a tremendous story about this
 unhone kaha, 'ek baar kerala main ekakaryakram ke baad ek bujurg vyakti unke paas aae or usne kaha ki aap hameshaa feminism kii baat kyon karti hai? kya aapkaa pati acha aadmi nahin he
 'he said that people think about Feminism even in a place like Kerala
 unhone kaha ki 21veen sadi main bhi hamen abhi yah charchaa kerani pad rahi he ki hamen feminist kyon hona chahie
 People do not even know about words like justice and equality

 Balian told reporters on Wednesday on the sidelines of a program, 'the onion lobby of Maharashtra created inflation by creating a crisis all over the country
 ab kendra sarkaar is lobby kii nakel kasne kii taiyaari kar chuki he
 Under this, the cultivation of onions and pulses in North India will be encouraged

 The Union Minister said that 6 months ago, the Center had sought information from all the states including Uttar Pradesh on the need for pulses
 uttar pradesh ne iskaa koi jawaab nahin diya
 If the campaign against hoarding of pulses and onions was conducted, Uttar Pradesh did not think it appropriate to take partisan action

 The Union Minister said that till now the government was not interested in purchasing pulses, but to deal with hoarders, the Central Government is now planning to purchase pulses from farmers

 Walian said that imported pulses will soon come in the market

 supreme court ne ne vyavastha di he ki sarkari pratishthanon main padon ke samunnayan (upar kii ore uthaane kii kriya) main anusuchit jati, anusuchit janajati yaa anya pichhadaa varg kota jaise aarakshan niyam lagu nahin honge kyonki inkaa laabh keval padonnati main diya ja saktaa he

 2014 loksabhaa chunaavon ke baad narendra modi kii puri film jaisi bhi bane, lekin shapath grahan samaaroh main unhone siyaasi takat kaa trailor zarur dikhaa diya

 The list of Modi's guests did not end here

 Modi, considered the bjp's prime ministerial contender in 2014, also called the party's state unit president and office bearers at the ceremony and conveyed the message of PM in waiting without saying anything
 modi ke paksh main koi bole yaa na bole lekin loksabhaa chunaavon ke dauraan modi kii bhoomika badi hone se kisi ko inkaar nahin
 The manner in which slogans were raised in support of Modi in the presence of all BJP leaders, it is clear that the dream of winning Delhi through Gujarat has grown
 vaajapeyi or adwani kii khaali jagah ko bharne ke liye bijepi main daavedaaron kii kami nahin, lekin modi is qatari main sabase aage dikhne lage hai
 Modi's critics, who first made Gujarat a Hinduism and then a laboratory for development, are also convinced of his charismatic personality and political ability
 modi gujarat kii siyasat karte hon, lekin unka kad rashtriya ban gaya
 Modi gave a new dimension to his politics by offering development on Hindutva politics, but this is not enough for Mission Delhi

 unka maananaa he ki nai dilli ne baatcheet kii unki peshkash ko isliye thukraa diya kyonki padosi desh main chunaav mempakistanek mudda he
 Addressing the Future Investment Initiative Forum in Riyadh, Khan said that Pakistan wants peace with all its neighbors and especially India and Afghanistan
 sarkari radio pakistan ne khan ke hawaale se kaha, ‘bharat ke saath shanti se donon deshon ko shastr spardhaa main lipt hone ke bajaay apane sansadhano kaa upyog maanav vikaas ke liye karne main madad milegi
 'our efforts have failed,' Imran said, adding that peace in Afghanistan will give Pakistan easy access to Central Asian countries for bilateral economic and trade activities
 khan ne kaha ki unhone bharat kii taraf dosti kaa haath badhaayaa tha lekin bharat ne use thukraa diya tha
 After assuming power in August, the Prime Minister of Pakistan wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, suggesting that a meeting of the two Foreign Ministers on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) be held in September
 bharat ne prastaav sweekaar kar liya, lekin kuch hi ghanton ke bheetar aatankwaadiyon ne jammu kashmir main teen pulicekarmiyon ko maar diya jiske baad nai dilli ne UNGA se itar videsh mantriyon kii baithak radd kar di thi
 Expecting change for Imran, Pakistan Prime Minister Khan said that he will once again extend a hand of friendship after the general elections in India are over
 bharat main agle saal aam chunaav hone hai
 His statement is also being linked to the ruling Modi government at the center
 pakistan main lagaataar bharat sarkaar or bijepi par jubaani hamale ho rahe hai
 Representatives of Pakistani-funded terrorists and the authorities there have also been seen to target Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 aise main imran ko ummid he ki maujuuda sarkaar main unki daal galane vaali nahin he or vah ab chunaav nateezon ke intjaar main hai taaki nai sarkaar aane par bharat kii ore nae sire se dosti kaa haath badhaayaa ja sake
 The American app based cab company will now deliver food to people in India

 Users will have a lot of choice here to choose different types of food and our delivery partners will provide fast service which will be for everyone and everywhere 'ubereats will get the existing food delivery service Jomato, Food Panda and Swiggy Setters
 aapako bataa den ki haal hi main google ne bharat main food delivery ap- Areo launch kiya he jo jise sirf bangaloru ke liye shuru kiya gaya he
 Under this, in addition to food orders from local restorates, other service orders can be made for household chores
 gauratlab he ki bhartiya ap besd cab company Ola ne bhi food deliver karne kii sarvice shuru kii thi
 But it was later discontinued
 ola kii sarvice ola cafe chaar shaharon main thi- dilli, mumbai, bangaloru or hyderabad
 The ubereats app can be downloaded on the Apple App Store and Android Play Store
 iconomic times ke mutabik is ap ke jariye order karne par 25 se 35 fisadi kamishan lagegaa jo ubar ke khate main jayega
 That means it will be more Swiggy j which takes 15 to 20 percent commission of the order value

 Earlier, Alok Verma came into action as soon as he took office
 unhone antarim pramukh nageshwar raav dwaara kiye gaye transfar ko radd karne ke saath-saath 5 adhikariyon kaa transfar bhi kar diya tha
 The Congress targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi after the removal of Alok Verma from the post of CBI Director and alleged that this move to remove Verma has again proved that Modi is scared of investigating the Rafale case
 party ne aadhikarik twit main kaha, 'apana paksh rakhane kaa mauka die bina alok verma ko hataakar pradhanmantri modi ne ek baar phir dikhaaya he ki vah rafel maamle kii kisi bhi tarah kii jaanch se dare hue hai, chaahe vah sibiai nideshak dwaara jaanch ho yaa jepisi kii jaanch ho

 ABVP over JNU dispute, three leaders resign
 According to the JNU administration, the Chief Proctor has not mentioned the reason in his resignation
 dimri ne bhi istife kii baat sweekaarte hue vajah bataane se inkaar kar diya he
 According to Dimari's close aides, he was unhappy with the way the JNU administration wanted the Chief Proctor to work

 It is worth mentioning that in the case of missing JNU student Najeeb Ahmed, the Proctorial Inquiry was done only in which around 9 students of ABVP were issued show cause notice

 During this period, the students and teachers to whom the show-cause was issued were issued directly through the registrar, while according to the university rules, the responsibility of issuing the show-cause in such cases is that of the chief proctor
 sutron ke mutabik najeeb ahamed kii gumshudagi ke masale ke baad dimri or jeenyu prashasan ke bich matbhed bad gaye the

 akhbaar ke anusaar inhen intelligence afasar kaha ja rahaa he
 There are some conditions for being an intelligence officer
 jaise samaajawaadee party main koi pad nahin hoga
 May be sympathetic to Samajwadi Party
 padhaa likhaa ho or compyatur se lekar mobile aplication ke sanchaalan main daksh ho
 There should be no relation with the local leader
 chunaav ke baad inhen baqayda training di jaaegi or akhilesh yadav ke saath inaki mulaakaat karai jaaegi
 Candidates will now be decided based on their feedback
 akhbaar ke mutabik akhilesh yadav agle chunaav main 100 se zyaada vidhayakon ke tikat kaat dena chaahate hai
 Intelligence officers will also keep an eye on whether the local mlas are working or not, propagating the government's plans
 yah koi saamaanya ghatana nahin he
 In a democracy, it is the duty of a citizen to not only monitor how the government is doing but it should be equally important for him how a party operates
 agar loktantr main sansthaaon ko chalaane ke liye party system hi sarvamaanya ikai he to party kaa loktantric hona behad zaruri he
 Any ordinary citizen gets trained in democracy by becoming active in these party systems and one day gradually becoming the representative of the people, becomes the head of the government or an ally of the head
 desh or vyavastha ko chalaane ke liye banaai jane vaali nitiyon ke prati samajhadaari uski isi yatra ke aadhaar par banati chali jaati he
 The leader having his own intelligence officer is telling that you have to walk in a party according to the leader
 netaa hi party he
 It started with the entry of outside strategy managers into the party at the time of elections
 pehle ye party ke liye aae or ab ye netaa ke liye aane lage hai
 Many leaders, equipped with resources and black money in different party have also started forming their own team
 chunaav ke vakt amareeki vishvavidhyalayon se kai bekaar chaatr yahaan badlaav ke naam par aate hai or netaaon ko safalataa kaa maarg bataane ke naam par un saare tareekon se las kar jate hai jisase kisi netaa ke liye party kii zarurat hi na rahe
 Similar work has also been done by strategists of advertising and slogan companies
 pichley loksabhaa main is prakriya kaa paripakv rup dekhne ko mila tha
 The selection of Narendra Modi as the prime ministerial candidate had more social media and media involvement than bjp's own leaders
 jise khud narendra modi ne sangathit rup se sanchalit kiya
 Namo Fan pressured from within the party that whoever has become our leader, you have to choose him as the leader
 uske baad ki sari prakriyaayein baahar se aae is dabaav ke anukool hoti raheen
 The hostile powers were rapidly collapsing
 main nahin kahata ki narendra modi yogya ummidavaar nahin the balki unke chayan main is prakriya ko nazarandaaz nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 During the Lok Sabha elections, in many places i found a team of youth with laptops
 ve puure din party ke ummidavaar ke chunavi karyaalay se lekar ilaake main ghumaa karte the dekhne ke liye ki janaab chunaav thik se lard rahe hai yaa nahin
 i met a group of such talented youngsters who came to prepare the BJP candidate's feedback
 unamem se kai narendra modi ke prati samarpit to nahin the magar ve is kaam ko peshewar tareeke se kar rahe the
 Those youths claimed that by submitting each information, they send it directly to their central team and from there reach Narendra Modi
 main isaki sachai ko satyapit nahin kar saktaa lekin feedback jamaa karne kaa yah tarika kaaphi anokhaa laga
 There are many times that a candidate sits with a ticket or does not contest properly
 chunaav prachaar ke dauraan party kaaryakartaaon se uske sambandh behatar nahin hote hai
 All this can be very risky because losing these reasons could have affected the future of the leader
 itnaa hi nahin us sansadeey kshetra main narendra modi kii raily bhi hone vaali thi jiske liye muddon se lekar feedback tak taiyaar kar unhen bhej diya gaya tha
 In a way, these boys were also acting like their personal auditors
 isaki shuruyaat bhi kuch chunaav pehle se ho chuki he
 When the candidates were privately keeping spies to get information about the opposing camp
 bachapan kaa ek kissa yaad aata he jo kisi se suna tha ki ek saansad the jo kehete the ki ham jitna chunaav lade utana fiks dipazit kar diye
 When Indira ji wavered, she won and if there was no wave, she lost
 party se jo paisa mila wo fiks dipazit kar diye
 Later, he went through many such stories that the candidate, knowing that he would lose the ticket from the party, because he gets a lot of money from the party fund and the party supporters of the area as soon as the ticket is received
 nishchit rup se aise chunavi kamau ummidavaaron kaa kissa maine congress main zyada suna he
 Later this disease also entered the BJP
 jiskaa upaay narendra modi ne apana system taiyaar kar khoj liya
 The comments party yaa netaa ke lihaaz se dekhen to chunaav jeetne ke liye sab acha he lekin is prakriya main kya badal rahaa he us par nazar rakhni chahie
 What can the leader of a team of its intelligence officers in a party mean
 kya us netaa kaa apni party par bharosa nahin rahaa jiskaa wo netaa he
 Every leader seems to be taking recourse to these non-political tricks of control and surveillance over the party
 demokrasi koreokrasi main badalati ja rahi he
 The way choreography is created on one stage, in the same way in politics, waves are now being created for the leader
 netaa ab ek avatar he jo aasmaan se laanch hota he
 Event management companies are the only real political parties
 raajnneetik dalon kaa buniyadi charitra tezi se badal rahaa he
 One should try to understand this process
 sanghathan ab mukhyalay tak simat kar rah gaya he or mukhyalay bhi satta main baithe netaa kaa ek vistaar yani ekstansion counter banakar rah gaya he
 The activist has been replaced by a fan who maintains a pro-activeness on social media
 kaaryakarta ek alag kism kaa jaivik or saamaajik praani he jabaki fain kritrim ho saktaa he or kuch samay se lekar lambey samay tak ke liye ho saktaa he
 Institutions within the party are becoming non-essential
 kai partiyon main sanghathan ke chunaav bemaani ho chuke hai
 The party's executive functions have remained a counter to the contracting event company
 intelligence afasar or iti cell hi ab party honge jo ek netaa ke liye kaam karenge
 Where there will be no place of ideology
 ek ranneeti hogi jo saamne vaale kii galati kaa turant phayda uthaane ke liye taiyaar rahegi

 The leader is the party
 isaki shuruyaat chunaavon ke vakt ranneeti banane vaale bahari manjaron ke party main pravesh se hui thi
 First they came for the party and now they have started coming for the leader
 alag alag party main sansadhano or kaale dhan se las kai netaaon ne bhi apni aisi team banani shuru kar di he
 At the time of elections, many useless students from American universities come here in the name of change and in the name of telling the leaders the path to success, they are equipped in all the ways so that no leader needs a party
 isi tarah kaa kaam vigyaapan or slogan companiyon ke ranneetikaar bhi karne lage hai
 This process had seen a mature form in the last Lok Sabha
 pradhanmantri ke ummidavaar ke taur par narendra modi ke chayan main bijepi ke apane netaaon se zyada soshal media or media kii bhagidaari thi
 Which was organized by Narendra Modi himself
 namo fain ne baahar se party ke bheetar dabaav daalaa ki jo hamaara netaa ban chukaa he aapako usee ko netaa chunanaa he
 After that all the processes continued to adapt to this pressure from outside
 pratikul shaktiyaan tezi se dhahati chali gayi
 i do not say that Narendra Modi was not a qualified candidate but this process cannot be ignored in his selection
 loksabhaa chunaavon ke dauraan kai jagahon par mujhe laptaap yukt yuvaaon kii team mili
 They roamed the entire day from the party candidate's election office to the area to see if Zanab was fighting the elections properly
 aisa hi behad pratibhashali yuvaaon kaa ek dal mujhe mila jo bijepi ke ummidavaar kaa feedback taiyaar karne aayaa tha
 Many of them were not devoted to Narendra Modi but they were doing this work in a professional manner
 un yuvaaon kaa daawa tha ki ek ek jaankaree jamaa kar ve sidhe apni kendriya team ko bhejte hai or vahaan se narendra modi tak pahunch jaataa he
 i cannot verify the veracity of this but found this method of collecting feedback quite unique
 kai baar hota he ki ummidavaar tikat lekar baith jaataa he yaa thik se chunaav nahin ladata he
 During the election campaign his relations with party workers are not better
 yah sab kaaphi jokhim kaa kaam ho saktaa he kyonki in vajahon se haarane ke kaaran netaa ke bhavishya par asar pad saktaa tha
 Not only this, Narendra Modi's rally was also going to be held in that parliamentary constituency, for which from issues to feedback, they were prepared and sent
 ye ladke ek tarah se apane nijee auditor kii tarah bhi kaam kar rahe the
 It has already started some elections
 jab ummidavaar nijee taur par jasoos rakhane lage the taaki virdohi kheme kii jaankaree mil sake
 There is an anecdote of childhood that recounts from someone that there was an MP who used to say that we should deposit as many fixes as we fought
 jab indira ji kii lahar hui to jeet gaye or lahar nahin rahi to haar gaye
 Deposit the money that was received from the party
 baad main aise kai kisson se guzara ki ummidavaar jaanate hue bhi ki vahaan se haaregaa party se isliye tikat chahta he kyonki tikat milte hi party fund or ilaake ke party samarthakon se kaaphi paisa mil jaataa he
 Certainly i have heard more about the story of such electoral candidates
 baad main yah beemaari bijepi main bhi ghus ai
 Whose solution was found by Narendra Modi by designing his system
 tippaniyan From the point of view of the party or leader, it is all good to win the election, but what is changing in this process should be closely monitored
 ek party main netaa kii apni intelligence afasaron kii team ke myne kya ho sakate hai
 Did the leader not trust his party of which he is the leader? har netaa party par niyantran or nigaraanee ke in gaiyr-raajnneetik totakon kaa sahaara letaa hua nazar aa rahaa he
 Democracy is changing into choreocracy
 jis tarah ek manch par koreography se dhadakanen paidaa kar di jaati hai usee tarah se raajnneeti main bhi ab netaa ke liye lehren paidaa kii ja rahi hai
 The leader is now an avatar who launches from the sky
 event management companiyaan hi ab asli raajnneetik dal hai
 The basic character of political parties is changing rapidly
 is prakriya ko samajhane kaa prayaas karnaa chahie
 The organization is now confined to the headquarters and the headquarters has also become an extension of the leader sitting in power i
e
 the extension counter
 kaaryakarta kii jagah fain ne le lee he jo soshal media par netaa ke prati sakriyata banaae rakhte hai
 a worker is a different type of biological and social animal whereas a fan can be artificial and can last for some time to a long time
 party ke bheetar kii sansthaaen gair zaruri hoti ja rahi hai
 Organization elections in many parties have become meaningless
 party kii kaaryakariniyan event company ko theka dene kaa counter banakar rah gayi hai
 Intelligence officers and IT cells will now be the party that will work for a leader
 jahaan vichaardhaara kii koi jagah nahin hogi
 There will be a strategy that will be ready to take immediate advantage of the fault of the front
 is koreokrasi main aapkaa swaagat he

 is koreokrasi main aapkaa swaagat he
 During the Lok Sabha elections, in many places i found a team of youth with laptops
 ve puure din party ke ummidavaar ke chunavi karyaalay se lekar ilaake main ghumaa karte the dekhne ke liye ki janaab chunaav thik se lard rahe hai yaa nahin
 i met a group of such talented youngsters who came to prepare the BJP candidate's feedback
 unamem se kai narendra modi ke prati samarpit to nahin the magar ve is kaam ko peshewar tareeke se kar rahe the
 Those youths claimed that by submitting each information, they send it directly to their central team and from there reach Narendra Modi
 main isaki sachai ko satyapit nahin kar saktaa lekin feedback jamaa karne kaa yah tarika kaaphi anokhaa laga
 There are many times that a candidate sits with a ticket or does not contest properly
 chunaav prachaar ke dauraan party kaaryakartaaon se uske sambandh behatar nahin hote hai
 All this can be very risky because losing these reasons could have affected the future of the leader
 itnaa hi nahin us sansadeey kshetra main narendra modi kii raily bhi hone vaali thi jiske liye muddon se lekar feedback tak taiyaar kar unhen bhej diya gaya tha
 In a way, these boys were also acting like their personal auditors
 isaki shuruyaat bhi kuch chunaav pehle se ho chuki he
 When the candidates were privately keeping spies to get information about the opposing camp
 bachapan kaa ek kissa yaad aata he jo kisi se suna tha ki ek saansad the jo kehete the ki ham jitna chunaav lade utana fiks dipazit kar diye
 When Indira ji wavered, she won and if there was no wave, she lost
 party se jo paisa mila wo fiks dipazit kar diye
 Later, he went through many such stories that the candidate, knowing that he would lose the ticket from the party, because he gets a lot of money from the party fund and the party supporters of the area as soon as the ticket is received
 nishchit rup se aise chunavi kamau ummidavaaron kaa kissa maine congress main zyada suna he
 Later this disease also entered the BJP
 jiskaa upaay narendra modi ne apana system taiyaar kar khoj liya
 The comments party yaa netaa ke lihaaz se dekhen to chunaav jeetne ke liye sab acha he lekin is prakriya main kya badal rahaa he us par nazar rakhni chahie
 What can the leader of a team of its intelligence officers in a party mean
 kya us netaa kaa apni party par bharosa nahin rahaa jiskaa wo netaa he
 Every leader seems to be taking recourse to these non-political tricks of control and surveillance over the party
 demokrasi koreokrasi main badalati ja rahi he
 The way choreography is created on one stage, in the same way in politics, waves are now being created for the leader
 netaa ab ek avatar he jo aasmaan se laanch hota he
 Event management companies are the only real political parties
 raajnneetik dalon kaa buniyadi charitra tezi se badal rahaa he
 One should try to understand this process
 sanghathan ab mukhyalay tak simat kar rah gaya he or mukhyalay bhi satta main baithe netaa kaa ek vistaar yani ekstansion counter banakar rah gaya he
 The activist has been replaced by a fan who maintains a pro-activeness on social media
 kaaryakarta ek alag kism kaa jaivik or saamaajik praani he jabaki fain kritrim ho saktaa he or kuch samay se lekar lambey samay tak ke liye ho saktaa he
 Institutions within the party are becoming non-essential
 kai partiyon main sanghathan ke chunaav bemaani ho chuke hai
 The party's executive functions have remained a counter to the contracting event company
 intelligence afasar or iti cell hi ab party honge jo ek netaa ke liye kaam karenge
 Where there will be no place of ideology
 ek ranneeti hogi jo saamne vaale kii galati kaa turant phayda uthaane ke liye taiyaar rahegi
 Welcome to this choreocracy
 kai baar hota he ki ummidavaar tikat lekar baith jaataa he yaa thik se chunaav nahin ladata he
 During the election campaign his relations with party workers are not better
 yah sab kaaphi jokhim kaa kaam ho saktaa he kyonki in vajahon se haarane ke kaaran netaa ke bhavishya par asar pad saktaa tha
 Not only this, Narendra Modi's rally was also going to be held in that parliamentary constituency, for which from issues to feedback, they were prepared and sent
 ye ladke ek tarah se apane nijee auditor kii tarah bhi kaam kar rahe the
 It has already started some elections
 jab ummidavaar nijee taur par jasoos rakhane lage the taaki virdohi kheme kii jaankaree mil sake
 There is an anecdote of childhood that recounts from someone that there was an MP who used to say that we should deposit as many fixes as we fought
 jab indira ji kii lahar hui to jeet gaye or lahar nahin rahi to haar gaye
 Deposit the money that was received from the party
 baad main aise kai kisson se guzara ki ummidavaar jaanate hue bhi ki vahaan se haaregaa party se isliye tikat chahta he kyonki tikat milte hi party fund or ilaake ke party samarthakon se kaaphi paisa mil jaataa he
 Certainly i have heard more about the story of such electoral candidates
 baad main yah beemaari bijepi main bhi ghus ai
 Whose solution was found by Narendra Modi by designing his system
 tippaniyan From the point of view of the party or leader, it is all good to win the election, but what is changing in this process should be closely monitored
 ek party main netaa kii apni intelligence afasaron kii team ke myne kya ho sakate hai
 Did the leader not trust his party of which he is the leader? har netaa party par niyantran or nigaraanee ke in gaiyr-raajnneetik totakon kaa sahaara letaa hua nazar aa rahaa he
 Democracy is changing into choreocracy
 jis tarah ek manch par koreography se dhadakanen paidaa kar di jaati hai usee tarah se raajnneeti main bhi ab netaa ke liye lehren paidaa kii ja rahi hai
 The leader is now an avatar who launches from the sky
 event management companiyaan hi ab asli raajnneetik dal hai

 'special 26' is based on the true events of 1987, when a man named Maun Singh, along with some of his colleagues, was raided in many cities of the country by becoming a fake CBI officer and was caught with crores of goods
 
 
 film main bhi ajay, yani akshay kumaar apni team ke saath kuch aisi hi farji red daalate hai or asli sibiai afasar wasim, yani manoj vaajapeyi ko chakma dete rahete hai
 
 
 The comments niraj pandey achche nirdeshak hai, yah baat unhone apni pehali hi film 'e vadensade' main sabit kar di thi, or ab 'special 26' main bhi kahani ko vaastaviktaa ke kareeb rakhkar unhone aklmandi kaa kaam kiya he, lekin kuch dikkat film kii kahani main he

 aam aadmi party is samay jis mode par khadi he vahaan se aage kaa rasta vikat he or usase bhi badi baat he ki unki team bikhar gai he, mahatvapurn log unhen chhodkar ja rahe hai or jo hai unamem vaimnasy badhata ja rahaa he
 Now a new thing has happened that the court has framed charges against Arvind Kejriwal in a contempt case which can cause a lot of difficulty for him
 unhone jis utsaah se bijepi netaa nitin gadakari ke khilaaf khule aam aarope lagaae vah unke liye mahangaa padataa ja rahaa he
 The Delhi judge has framed charges against him under sections 499 and 500 in this case
 kejariwal ne jaj kii pahal ke baad bhi maamle main sulah karnaa uchit nahin samajha jo ek doordarshee kadam nahin kaha ja saktaa
 But even bigger problem is that two of his prominent soldiers have clashed with each other
 pehle to yogendra yadav or naveen jaihind bhid gaye
 At that time, the matter was not calm even when Kejriwal's special friend Manish Sisodia collided with Yogendra Yadav
 donon main email ke madhyam se jang hone lagi he or manish yogendra par prahaar karne se baj nahin aa rahe hai
 Manish is accusing them that Kejriwal agreed to contest elections in India instead of Delhi
 lekin jo log kejariwal kii prakruti ko jaanate hai ve manish ke is kathan par hansenge
 Aam Aadmi Party chief Arvind Kejriwal is an ambitious and publicity choice person
 unke liye party kitni ahmiyat rakhti he yah isse hi pataa chalata he ki loksabhaa chunaav main sabhi partiyon se zyada ummidavaar khadey karne ke baad ve unke ilaakon main jhaankne bhi nahin gaye
 He stayed only in Narendra Modi's constituency Varanasi so that he would get full mileage
 unke bharose khadey saikadon ummidavaar khadey ke khadey rah gaye
 Leaving them in the limelight, Netaji started contesting his election
 in sabakaa labboluab yah he ki aam aadmi party is samay ek najuk daur se guzar rahi he
 It is to be seen now how much talent and leadership art is there in Kejriwal because at that time the country was going through a phase in which the people of Delhi needed an honest and combative leader
 kejariwal main ve gun unhen dikhe or ve unke saath hote chale gaye or ek kaaravaan hi ban gaya
 But today, in front of Narendra Modi's huge stature, all the leaders are looking small
 aise main kejariwal kaa jaadu gaayab sa ho gaya he
 The remaining cancer was completed by the dissatisfaction of leaders and activists
 ab party ke saamne apana astitv bachaane kii chunauti he
 Now the way forward is difficult
 unhen pehle to unhen bikharati party ko ek karnaa hoga or phir use majbootee pradaan karnaa hoga
 This is not an easy task under today's circumstances
 kaaryakartaaon kaa manobal gira hua he or madhya varg ke log jo kabhi unka aadhaar the, ab unase dur hote ja rahe hai
 There is a big ideological crisis in the party because Kejriwal now considers communalism a bigger issue than corruption
 yah aisa mudda he jo congress, vam dalon, yadavi partiyon ko zyada suut karata he
 They run their own 'shop' of politics on this basis
 jab itani sari partiyaan or netaa is 'mahaan' uddeshy main lagi hui hai to us bheed main kejariwal kahaan feet baithenge, yah kahana mushkil he
 It is a tough exam time for Kejriwal and now you will know how skilled he is

 Gill is credited with crushing terrorism in Punjab
 gogoi ne kaha, ‘ham par gupt hatyaein jari rakhane kaa dabaav tha lekin hamane aisa nahin kiya
 When i became the Chief Minister in 2001, the BJP wanted the secret killings to continue and Advani wanted KPS Gill to be sent as Governor for this
 'unhone daawa kiya ki unki sarkaar ke dabaav ke kaaran gil ko purvottar rajya main nahin bheja gaya
 Gogoi was referring to the extrajudicial killing of suspected ULFA militants and their kin by masked people in the 1990s
 gogoi ne kaha, ‘mahant jab satta main the to assam main gupt hatyaein huin
 Then there was the BJP government at the Center
 ab mahant kehete hai ki unhone centre ke nirdesh par aisa kiya
 Assam BJP General Secretary Dilip Saikia dismissed the allegations
 saciya ne kaha, ‘yah aadharahin aarope he
 We have always believed in the integrity of India but not at the cost of covert killing of innocent people
 agar vah eemaandaar the to unhone gupt hatyaon kii jaanch ke aadesh kyon nahin die? vah sasti, vibhaajankaree raajnneeti kar rahe hai
 He said the Congress broke talks with the ULFA
 assam gana parishad (agap) ke prafull kumaar mahant ne kaha ki unke purvavarti congress netaa hiteshwar saciya ne gupt hatyaon kaa kaam shuru karaayaa
 He alleged, 'congress started secret killings
 hiteshwar saciya ne aisa karaayaa
 Its first victim became Bhupen Bora of Tezpur, who was kidnapped and killed by the Congress government
 ' saciya 1991 se 1996 tak assam ke mukhyamantri rahe
 Asked whether such killings continued even during his tenure as Chief Minister, Mahanta said, "the unified command was accountable for all security-related issues and it worked under the central government
" ' gogoi ne kaha ki rajg ek kii sarkaar un par ulpha ke prati ‘narmi' baratane kaa aarope lagaati thi kyonki unhone nirdosh logon kii hatya nahin hone di

 In the election season, there is a period of change of party among the leaders, in view of political profit and loss, the leaders are not even hesitant to break ties with their relatives
 aisa hi ek maamla upi ke badaayun se saamne aayaa he
 Samajwadi Party (SP) MP from Badaun, Dharmendra Yadav has spoken of breaking all relations with his brother-in-law Anujesh Pratap Singh when he joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)
 dharmendra yadav ne kaha, unhen pataa chalaa he ki anujesh pratap singh 24 march ko bijepi main shaamil hue hai

 Therefore, he has no relationship with Anujesh Pratap Singh anymore

 Former Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dixit has given a shocking statement about government formation in Delhi

 He said that if the BJP is in a position to form a government, it is good
 
 
 use sarkaar bana leni chahie
 The Congress, however, rejected Sheila Dixit's response, saying it could be her personal opinion
 dilli congress vidhayak dal ke netaa harun yusuf ne kaha ki congress kabhi sampradayik takaton kaa samarthan nahin kar sakati he or party dilli main dobaaraa chunaav ke paksh main he
 On Sheila's statement, Delhi Pradesh BJP President Satish Upadhyay has said that this is a mature and serious comment of Sheila Dixit as a politician
 satish upaadhyaay pehle se kehete aa rahe hai ki agar unhen uparajyapal kii ore se nyotaa miltaa he to vah dilli main sarkaar banane par jarur sochenge
 The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has reacted sharply to Sheila Dixit's statement
 party ke netaa ashutosh ne twit karke kaha he ki aisa lagata he ki shila dikshit or amit shah ek sur main bol rahe hai or donon dilli main bijepi kii sarkaar bananaa chaahate hai
 
 
 Congress should clear its stand on this
 ullekhneey he ki kerala ke rajyapal pad se istipha de chukin shila dikshit ne pichley dinon sakriy raajnneeti main lautne ke sanket die the
 Sheila had said that her future role would be decided by the Congress leadership

 Answer: Former CM Ashok Chavan's reply to Sanjay Nirupam raised on Congress leadership, serious question Chavan said- When he was strong, he used to speak well, Congress's infighting has come to the fore right before polling for assembly elections in Maharashtra and Haryana
 
 haryana congress ke purv adhyaksh ashok tanvar ne istipha diya he to mumbai congress ke adhyaksh rahe sanjay nirupam ne spasht taur par party ke sheersh netritv ko sawaalon ke ghere main khadaa kiya he
 Former Maharashtra Chief Minister and Congress leader Ashok Chavan has responded to Sanjay Nirupam's remarks
 ashok chavaan ne sanjay nirupam ke party main gutbaji ke aarope par kaha ki yah unki nijee raay ho sakati he
 Chavan said, 'as long as he was strong in the party, he was speaking well
 lekin jab baat nahin bani to wo aalochana kar rahe hai
 While giving this answer to Sanjay Nirupam, Chavan further said that he is his friend and does not want to say too much on this issue
 chavaan ne yah tippanee sanjay nirupam ke us bayaan par kii he, jisamen unhone yahaan tak kah diya tha ki congress kii antarim adhyaksh sonia gandhi ko apane darbariyon se mukti pani chahie
 Nirupam had said that she is not against Sonia Gandhi, but she should get rid of such people
 tikat vitaran par uthaae hai sawalsanjay nirupam ne aarope lagaaya ki jyotiraditya sindhiya ek baar bhi maharashtra nahin aae hai or apane doston se baatcheet ke aadhaar par tikat baant die hai
 He also said that people like Mallikarjun Kharge are useless, there is no interest in running the party
 21 oktober ko hone ja rahe matdaan se pehle maharashtra va haryana congress main gutbaji saarvajanik manchon se saamne aa rahi he
 The surprising thing is that the leaders who rebel against the Congress are directly targeting the Congress high command and questioning them

 Sophie Chaudhary, who has entered the world of music from singers, writers, composers, actresses and models, believes that she is not one, not two, but three times more a threat to her co-stars
 saal 2000 main mujeec band se apane kariyar kii pari shuru karne vaali sophy intertenment ke lihaaj se ek campalit package hai
 Very few people will know that in the year 2000, an all girls band named 'sansara' came
 is band ke members bhi aapako shaayad hi yaad honge
 This band could not play for a long time, but for 16 years, the voice of a band member kept their foot firmly in the world of pop music, with their tunes, they still make people dance
 sophy ne yun to kai hit pop gane die hai lekin sophy ke 16 saal ke lambey kariyar main unako abhi tak bollywood filmon main brake nahin mil paaya he
 Recently Sophie has released her new song 'sajan Main Nachungi'
 ek khaas mulaakaat main sophy ne bataaya, 'main ek multitaskar hum or main is maamle main bilkul dikhaava nahin karuungi
 i used to do acting, singing and weezing together
 meraa pehla kaam audiyans ko interten karnaa he
 There are many such actresses in Bollywood who are very good singers
 shaadi kaa sijan bas shuru hone vaala he
 So Sophie launched this song keeping in mind the wedding parties
 khaastaur se dilli menveding sijanko cash karaane ke makasad se sophy ne is gane ko dilli main launch kiya
 The song 'sajan Main Nachungi' is a modified version of the 1953 classic song
 6 dashakon ke baad is gane ko darshakon ke saamne ek baar phir pesh karnaa kisi chunauti se kam nahin tha
 Sophie told, 'this song is totally different, the old song is a sad song
 meraa gaanaa ekadam yang or papi he jisamen dhol beet he
 We all have fun in marriage and through this song i want people to have a lot of fun '
 sofika ye gaanaa logon ko khub pasand aa rahaa he
 Sophie is also excited by the response from the audience
 itnaa hi nahin unhen puri ummid he ki aane vaale shaadi ke sijan main ye gaanaa dilli ke party cirkil main khub pasand kiya jayega
 We would be wrong to say that the Indian middle class does not save and believes only in extravagance
 bharat kii bachat dar dekhen to vah kaaphi zyada he or isamen madhya varg kaa bada yogadan he
 He also thinks about tomorrow
 vah makaan or bacchon ke future or kai anya tarah kii jaruraton ke liye shuru se hi jodta chalata he
 But our society is aspirational / aspirational
 aisa samaaj jo ummiido se labarej he, jisaki dheron apekshaayen hai
 India is a spiritual country and the roots of life here are deeply rooted in religion, artha, kama and moksha, the four pillars of Hindu philosophy
 arth kii baat karne par maa lakshmi kaa zikr aata he
 We worship them and keep the doors and windows of the house open on Diwali
 isse paise kaa mahatv or usase judi hamaari manyata spasht ho jaati he
 In the matter of business, even the balance sheet of even the smallest entrepreneur of India is always right, no matter how it is in any corner of the world
 isiilie bharatiyon ko rejilient antraprenyor (jujharu udhyami) mana jaataa he
 Because of this, the Earth Factor is dominating today
 hamaara samaaj upar se neeche tak kai staron main banta hua he
 Here the emphasis is on status
 pehle yah jati vyavastha aadhaarit hota tha
 But its grip kept loosening, especially in cities
 ab status dikhaane kaa tarika badal rahaa he
 Economic forces are coming to the lower strata and they also want to show their changing status through material things
 beshak gujarat jaise rajya ab bhi apwaad hai, jahaan ke dhani log aaj bhi saadagi se jivan gujaarne main yakeen karte hai
 i also saw an example of this during my recent visit to Japan
 main sujuki company ke maalik se mila to dekhakar hairaani hui ki unke paas ek gaadi or do kamare kaa makaan he
 This is not possible in India at all
 hamaara madhya varg pragatisheel duniya se judsa chahta he
 Now his expectations are not the same as the old middle class
 aaj uski tamanna kuch zyada hasil karne kii he
 This is also indicated by the fact that India is the leading country in terms of credit card companies
 aakankshi samaaj hameshaa ummiido or umang se labarej hota he
 He has the quirk to move forward and has the ability to overcome any kind of adversity
 bilkul usee tarah jaisaa gaalib ne kaha he: mushkilen mujh par padin itani ki asaan ho gayi
 This class runs on this philosophy and goes on its journey
 is sabake bich vah material disple par yakeen karnaa bhi nahin chodta
 It is often asked whether GDP benefits to the middle class by loosening their pockets? Yes, it is good for GDP
 lekin! jid (yani gros domestic hepiness) ke liye nahin
 The rich section should also think about the class which does not have such resources
 saamaajik samvedansheeltaa behad jaruri he
 For countries like India, it becomes imperative to look at this aspect because the country is far ahead of the rest of the world in terms of poverty, illiteracy and malnutrition
 isliye sabkon ko saath lekar chalane kii bhaavana bahut jaruri he
 The definition of middle class has also changed to a large extent due to so many changes
 pehle madhya varg kaa ubhaar kshetreey tha, lekin ab ise rashtriya str par dekha ja saktaa he
 This is due to the revolution in television, media, communication and transport
 madhya varg kaa na sirf aakaar badha he balki yah pehle se kaaphi zyada prabhaavshaalee bhi ho gaya he
 And above all, it has now gone much higher than the caste system
 jahaan tak madhya varg ke paas aa rahe paise ke jariye kii baat he to vah naukari, krishi or jameen-jaaydaad bechakar har tareeke se paisa kama rahaa he
 Sadly, about 60 per cent of the people in this country are involved in agriculture but its contribution to GDP is only 16 per cent whereas such a large number of people are not connected to the service sector but it would have contributed 50-55 per cent in GDP
 is
 paise kaa flo har sector se he
 But after 1991, there has been a tremendous increase in the money coming through the service sector
 bharat main kharch karne kaa, sach puuchhie to koi pattern nahin he
 The level of satisfaction here matters

 The tendency of the middle class to spend heavily will never end because of this "little more" desire
 iskaa vistaar hoga
 Poverty will be less

 After New Zealand's young batsman Jesse Ryder and Kane Williamson, playing in the debut match, kept the third Indian bowler of the first cricket Test out of wickets for almost two seasons, fast bowler s Sreesanth said today that the bowlers of the host team made the Motera captain here Well done on the flat pitch of Patel Stadium
 rider ko din ke antim over main out karke bharat ko paanchavin safalataa dilaane vaale kerala ke is tej gendbaaj ne kaha, ‘yah sapaat pich thi
 We bowled quite well but the bowlers were not getting any help
 reverse swing bhi nahin mil rahi thi
 The 194-run partnership for the fifth wicket between Ryder (103) and Williamson (87 not out) helped New Zealand score 331 for the fifth wicket at the end of the third day in response to India's first innings total of 487

 He said, "we were caught out but we missed the catch
" ’ rider us samay 11 ran banaakar khel rahe the jabaki team kaa score chaar wicket par 166 ran tha
 New Zealand are still trailing by 156 runs, but despite this, Sreesanth hoped that the hosts could still win the match as it would not be easy for the New Zealand batsmen to face the spin duo of Pragyan Ojha and Harbhajan Singh in the second innings

 Odisha claims that the history of Rasgulla is related to its state, while West Bengal is also claiming Rasgulla

 bengal to khud hi maan rahaa he ki uskaa rasagulla 150 saal purana he

 The West Bengal government is taking the help of KC Das Private Limited to gather historical evidence to reveal Rasgulla or Rasogulla

 But Yamuna slowly moved backward

 The park developed by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) has added beauty to the beauty of the place, but has set the Yamuna River 100 yards away from the world famous marble mausoleum

 This is not protection

 bagdadi ke undervier kaa CIA conectionis samasya ko sulajhane ke liye america khufia agency CIA ne kurd ladaakon ke sanghathan sirian democratic forcej (SDF) ke jasuson se haath milaayaa
 An agent of the SDF meticulously rushed to the house where Baghdadi lived
 usne vahaan se bagdadi ke kuch undervier ko churaayaa or use america balon ko saunp diya
 By testing DNA from a sample from this underwear, America became 100 percent comfortable that the person present there is a terrorist of ISIS
 iske baad america ne is oparation ko anjaam diya
 Polt Caine, a senior SDF advisor, explained the story of Baghdadi's underwear on Twitter in detail
 unhone kaha, "15 may se hi ham bagdadi ke thikaane par najar rakh rahe the or use khojane kii koshish kar rahe the
 We managed to find out from our sources that Baghdadi has moved from Al Jor area of al Dashisha towards Idlib

 Then one of our agents reached the house where Baghdadi lived
 usne bagdadi ke kuch undervier ko hasil kiya or waapas aa gaya
 After this, DNA test was done with this underwear sample and it was ensured that the person who was looking for America lives in the same house

 So there was news that Baghdadi is going to change its base once again
 isi bich ek anya ghatnakram main turki ne syria main kurd ladaakon par hamalaa kar diya
 Because of this, the US had to stop its operation for a few days
 hamale ke dauraan kurdon kaa mila saathturki ne jald hi syria main apana oparation roak diya
 After this, the US once again launched a campaign to carry out its operation
 aakhirkaar shanivaar kii raat ko america ne is hamale ko anjaam diya
 US President Donald Trump, who was addressing the country after the end of Baghdadi, referred to the help from the Kurds
 turki ke sainya salaahkaar paulat can ne kaha ki america sena ko unki ore se puri madad mili
 The SDF helped the American troops to describe the airdrop as a target

 agar balakot main kii gai bhartiya sena kii air strike main pakistan ko koi nuksaan nahin pahunchaa he to vah international media ko vahaan jane kyon nahin de rahaa he
 Defense Minister Nirmala Sitharaman reached Aaj Tak's security meeting raising these questions
 unase sawaal kiya tivitien ke news diarector rahul kanwal ne
 The Defense Minister said that if Pakistan is saying that only trees have fallen in the air strike, then it should also be shown to the people
 aakhir media ke vahaan jane par bain kyon lagaaya gaya he
 He further said that it has been his habit to tell what lies to anyone
 bharat ke paas pukhta jaankaree thi ki vahaan fidaayin hamalaa karne waalon ko training di jaani thi or isamen nae or puraane donon aatankiyon ko bulaayaa gaya tha
 These people wanted to spread panic in India by taking training here

 The FBI said in its statement, "the threat posed by the extremists is real and it remains constant and is evolving into new dangerous modalities
" america dharti par hamale kii sambhavit sajishon se lekar yah pataa chalane tak ki americanyon ko desh se baahar jihad ke liye bhartee kiya ja rahaa he tak salbhar hamaare paas reporton kaa tantaa bana rahaa

 bhartiya antariksh anusandhan santhaan (ISRO) aise swadeshi rocket ko viksit karne par kaam kar rahaa he, jiskaa vajan 200 vayask haathiyon ke baraabar hoga or bhavishya main iske jariye bharatiyon ko antariksh main bheja ja sakegaa
 ISRO is preparing to enter the new world of the world's heavy-weight and multi-billion dollar launch market
 iske liye andhra pradesh ke sriharikota main rocket prakshepan centre main nirmit desh ke sabase baari rocket bhusthitik upgrah prakshepan yaan maa-3 (GSLV MK-III) viksit kiya ja rahaa he
 This rocket will be capable of carrying the heaviest satellites ever
 isroke adhyaksh eyes kiran kumaar ne kaha, ham yah sunishchit karne kii har sambhav koshish kar rahe hai ki yah nayaa puri tarah aatmanirbhit bhartiya rocket apane pehle hi prakshepan main safal ho
 This will be the first test launch of the GSLV MK-III, previously named launch vehicle MAK-3, but the rocket has been used by Indians from Indian soil to space into India, after all being true in a decade or at least six successful launches
 i will send it in rus, america or china ke baad bharat banegaa chauthaa deshyah rocket prithvi kii nichali kaksha main aath ton tak kaa vajan le jane main sakasham he
 ISRO has already drawn up plans that if the government approves the amount of three to four billion dollars, it will take a two-three-man crew into space
 agar yah maanviya upkram hakeekat main badal jaataa he, to bharat rus, america or china ke baad chauthaa aisa desh ban jayega, jiskaa ek maanviya antariksh udaan kaarykram hoga
 ISRO says the cost of developing the rocket will be the first Indian woman to go into space
 monsoon se pehle kii bheeshan garmi main bharat ke lonching stesan main bhartiya antariksh agency ke ejeeniyar puri tarah se desh main nirmit rocket launch karne kii jor shor se taiyaari kar rahe hai
 This new rocket is capable of carrying a four-tonne class satellite in geostationary orbit
 aisa anumaan he ki is nae rocket ko viksit karne kii laagat 300 karod rupee he, lekin ek bhartiya prakshepak kaa istemaal nai dilli ke sanchaar upgrahon ko sthapit karne main kiye jane par desh lagbhag itani hi bachat kar legaa
 Successful launching at first is not easy
 At this time, India uses the French Ariane 5 launched from Kourou in South America to place heavy four-tonne communications satellites
 kumaar ne jor diya ki GSLV MK-III ek aisa rocket he, jise shuruyaat se bharat ne dizin or develop kiya he, isliye ISRO ke ejeeniyar chaahate hai ki unki pehali koshish safal rahe
 This is not an easy task, as India's track record says that its first rocket launches have often failed
 dhruviya upgrah pramochan vaahan (PSLV) varsh 1993 main apni pehali udaan main asafal rahaa tha or iske baad se isane lagaataar 38 safal prakshepan kiye
 Similarly, the geostationary satellite launch vehicle MK 1 failed in 2001 and since then it has made 11 launches, half of which have been successful
 bharat ke paas do rocket hai jo parichaalan main hai
 PSLV 1 of these
 5 ton vajani upgrahon ko antariksh main le ja sakane main sakasham he or bharat ke chandra or mangal ke pehle abhiyaanon main ise hi praathamikta di gai
 The second rocket GSLV MK-II can launch two tonne class satellites and is repeatedly called the Naughty Boy of ISRO due to its failure
 nae GSLV MK-III kaa varsh 2014 main yah samajhane ke liye ek saborbit test launch kiya gaya tha ki yah vayumandal main kaisaa pradarshan karata he
 The rocket can carry as much weight as the SUV, although the GSLV MK-III has a length of 43 meters, which is the smallest of the three big Indian rockets but it is 1 from India's largest rocket GSLV MK-II
 5 guna adhik he or PSLV se doguna he
 The design of this rocket is superb and it is capable of carrying equal weight space of two suvs
 prakshpen centre main is yaan ko lekar utsaah kaa zikr karte hue kumaar ne kaha, puri tarah se ek nayaa rocket or atyadhik kshamta vaali ek puri nai upgrah pranali prakshepan ke liye taiyaar he
