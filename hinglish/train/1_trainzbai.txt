ye to bihar or nepal kii seemaa kii baat he lekin uttarapradesh se lage nepal ke border par yah sankhya yahaan se kai guna zyada he
 If seen in this way, the meat traders in Nepal are getting silver in the same way as the liquor traders of Nepal are happy with the closure of the slaughter house in Uttar Pradesh
 bihar main sharaab bandi se nepal ke sharaab karobaariyon kaa vyapaar 30 se 40 pratishat tak bad gaya he
 The air of the capital Delhi has become poisonous
 gadiyon se niklaa dhuaan sadakon se udi dhul or sarkaar kii naakamayaabi ne dilli ko gas chembar bana diya he
 Even Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has said that the capital has become a gas chamber
 rajdhani kii aabhohawaa main yah ghulaa jehar sirf dilli kaa nahin, balki aasapaas ke rajyon se niklaa vah kaala dhuaan he, jo kheton main padi paraali jalaane ke baad uthaa
 To know the ground reality till date, the team has visited some areas of Haryana
 dillise mahaj kuch kilometre dur sonipat main kheton main paraali jalaae jane ke nishaan mili
 Due to the fog reading for the last two to three days, the incidents of stubble burning are almost stopped now
 kohre se nam padi kheton kii paraali jalane laayak nahin he, lekin pichley 10-15 dinon main jo dhuaan in kheton se uthaa vah jehar ban kar vaataavaran main failaa or dilli tak jaakar bacchon va bujurgon ko biimaar kar rahaa he
 Why is the parlias lit up? The reporter tried to know from the farmers of Sonepat that why the parali is burnt and they have no idea that this smoke will darken the lungs of their children too? The farmers say that they have no other way than to burn the straw
 kyonki ye aasaan or samay bachaane kaa tarika he
 Farmers also say that it is incurred to cut the stubble and move it to another place, which the farmer cannot do
 kai kisaan to yah maanane ko taiyaar nahin hai ki paraali jalaae jane se hawa kharaab ho rahi he
 Rather, they say that the pollution caused by the vehicles and the emissions from factories in the states increases more pollution than stubble burning
 kuch kisaanon ne aaj tak se baatcheet main yah bhi kaha ki agar sarkaar paraali jalaae jane ko lekar gambhir he to use kisaanon ko sahuuliyat deni chahie or paraali ko dhulaai karne main sabsidi deni chahie
 Aaj Tak visited Karnal area of haryana after Halonipat
 dhundh kii chapet main lipta karnal gavaahi de rahaa he ki kaise paraali ke dhuen ne kohre ke saath milakar logon ko biimaar karne kii sajeesh kii he
 Stubble was burnt in the area in the past days
 ek saptaah se kohre kii nami ke chalatekheton se dhunouthanaa tham gaya he, lekin jo dhuna pehle se hi aasmaan ko khuli ankhon se ojhal kar rahaa tha, wo ab fefdon ko biimaar kar rahaa he
 Aaj Tak talked to the farmers of Karnal and tried to know when they will get rid of the years old poisonous tradition? Haryana Kisan Union state president Karma Singh says that farmers have no other easy means than this
 kyonki agali fasal kii buaai ke liye unka intjaar behad kam ho jaataa he
 Farmers say that to save time, after harvesting the crop, they burn the straw standing in the fields
 karnal ke duusare kisaanon kaa kahana he ki paraali ko katkar le jane ke liye jo kharch aata he wo kisaan vahan nahin kar saktaa
 Some farmers blame the smoke emanating from vehicles and factories for more pollution than straw
 haryana kisaan union ke pradesh adhyaksh ne aaj tak se baatcheet main kaha ki haryana sarkaar gaushalaayein khol rahi he
 In such a situation, if they buy the stubble of the farmers with MNREGA money and use it as fodder, then the state can get rid of the problems caused by burning of stubble
 kisaanon kaa yah bhi kahana he ki agar sarkaar paraali kii dhulaai main sabsidi de yaa iskaa kharch vaahan karen to kisaan paraali nahin jalaayenge
 It is not the case of Kurukshetra that no legal action has been taken to burn the straw
 sirf kurukshetra main prashasan ne dedh sau se zyada kisaanon kaa chaalaan kiya he or 5 paraali jalaaye jane ke maamle main mukadmaa bhi darj kiya he
 Police Vice President Gurmel Singh said that we have registered five firs in connection with burning of stubble and also through AAP we want to urge farmers not to do so
 kyonki isse na sirfpradooshanfailega, balki vah bhi biimaar honge
 The administration itself believes that stubble has been burnt in different areas of Haryana
 kurukshetra kii dipti kamishnar sumedha kataaria ne aaj tak se baatcheet main kaha ki pichley dinon unke ilaake main paraali jalane kii kaaphi ghatnaayen huin, jo philhal kuch dinon se tham gai hai
 Sumedha Kataria said that incidents of stubble burning had come to light recently
 dedh sau se zyada chaalaan kaate gaye hai
 The farmers are being asked not to do this by running a campaign
 paraali kaa istemaal bataur chaare ke rup main bhi kiya ja saktaa he, jiske tahat project par kaam kiya ja rahaa he
 It is true that the smoke emanating from it is dissolving the poison in the air
 ek lambii prakriya he jo nirantar karne kii jarurat he
 Burning the straw is an easy way for the farmers, but they believe that its smoke is making their children sick too
 lekin kisaan sarkaar kii ore najar uthaakar dekh rahe hai ki vah is maamle main saamne aae or unki madad karen
 But until this happens, the common man is forced to breathe in this poisonous air

 If the farmers come to the rally on their own, we have nothing to say about it, but if they come by themselves, it also means that the condition of the farmers in Assam is really good

 guuruuvaar ko sansadeey cameti main kareeb dhai ghante se zyada der tak bhansaali kii peshi hui
 Many questions were raised with Bhansali
 unhen kuch sawaalon ke likhit jawaab ke liye do hafte kaa vakt diya gaya he
 He was told in the meeting that people are not against any film, but the responsibility of mps is that there should be no problem in the society due to the film
 satipratha ko lekar cameti ne bhansaali ko gheraa
 According to sources inside, Bhansali said, his film is not based on history but on the poetry of Malik Mohammad Jaisi
 haalanki film ko kai logon ko dikhaae jane ke sawaal par unke paas koi santoshjanak jawaab nahin tha
 Let us tell you that Malik Mohammad Jaisi composed an epic poem 'padmavat' in Awadhi
 yah rani padmini kii kahani he
 According to which, Mohit Sultan Alauddin Khilji as queen wanted to get him under any circumstances, for this he attacked Chittor, but with thousands of Rajput women, Rani Padmini jumped into the fire and committed Jauhar

 cameti ne sawaal kiya ki kya film main johar kaa drishy dikhaaya gaya he? kya sati pratha ko filmon main dikhaaya ja saktaa he?bhansaali se puche gaye sawaal # 1
 Why did you show the film to some people in the media before sending the film to the censor board? what does this mean
 # 2
 You sent the film to the censor board on 11 November and announced by yourself that the film will be released on 1 December, while you know that the censor board has 68 days to give the certificate to the film
 apane khud se taarikh kaise tay kar lee? # 3
 When the dispute has been going on for the last year and a half, why didn't you take steps to fix it? # 4
 jab filmon main saare naam or saare kairactor itihaas se liye hue hai tab yah kaise kaha ja saktaa he ki film kaa itihaas se koi lenaa dena nahin he
 # 5
 kya yah baat sahi he ki aapane pehle karani sena ko yah vaada kiya tha ki film unhen dikhaaenge? # 6
 Does the film depict Johar's scene? Can Sati practice be shown in films? Many of these questions were answered by Bhansali to the committee
 kuch jawaab ke liye unhen 2 hafte kaa vakt diya gaya he
 Tampering with historical facts in the film was wrong - three members of Nana Patekarkameti said - Ban Banh Bhansali and Censor Board President Prasoon Joshi appeared before the Information and Technical Committee of Parliament on Thursday

 left ne bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar kii us maang ko jaij tehraaya he jisamen unhone bihar ko vishesh rajya kaa darja dene kii maang kii he
 CPI General Secretary AB Bardhan has said that if our government is formed then we will consider Nitish's demand
 gauratlab he ki nitish kumaar ne kaha he ki unki party kaa samarthan use hi milegaa jo bihar ko vishesh rajya kaa darja degaa
 Nitish is a major ally of NDA, but after this statement, the beat of NDA must have increased
 nitish endie ke saath apni ekajutata kii baat baar baar doharaate rahe hai, lekin unke is taaja rukh se lagata he ki oont kisi bhi karavat baith saktaa he
 On the other hand, Congress leader Digvijay Singh said on Nitish's statement that it is possible to consider his demand
 stri kii sabase bady chahat yah hoti he ki jis kisi purush se vah prem karti he, vah chaahati he ki uskaa premi use puraa samay de, usase baatcheet kare, uski bhaavnaatmak or shaareerik jaruraton ko acchhee tarah samajhe
 Even in the case of a physical relationship, instead of expressing her own feelings, she hopes that her boy friend or lover tries to understand her feelings on her own
 rahasy he strivaise to striyon kaa prem purushon ke liye hameshaa se ek rahasy rahaa he
 It is very difficult for any man to know what a woman wants in love and sometimes it is impossible
 jaane kya chaahati he vonational skin centre nai dilli ke dow
 If Naveen Taneja believes, you can easily guess what she wants from the behavior of women and her gestures
 hambistar kii taiyaari ke kram main agar koi stri apane maathe par apana haath rakhi ho to aap is sanket ko is prakaar samaj sakate hai jaise vah aap par haaavee hona chaah rahi ho
 When she looks like you have placed her hand on your chest like this, then she wants to indicate that you can move slowly
 aise hi jab vah aapke ankhon main ankhen daalkar dekh rahi ho to aap samaj le ki vah chaah rahi he ki aap use apane niyantran main le len
 If she is looking towards her feet, then she will definitely be traveling in Kalpanaaloka and would expect you to join her

 Union Housing and Urban Development Minister Hardeep Singh Puri has targeted the Delhi government over this entire incident
 NDTV se khaas baatcheet main unhone kaha ki main us jagah par gaya hum
 This is very unfortunate, there comes a cry
 choti- choti si galiyaan hai taare aisi latak rahi hai ki agar koi patang uda rahaa ho or taar main uski door fas jaae to short circuit ho jayega
 He raised questions that 50 people are living in a factory running in a small place and no one is aware of it
 unhone aage kaha ki ab chhodie ki usamen kiski galati kya he
 i ask a simple question, if there is a fire department in the Delhi government or any government, there is an industry department and there is a labor department, then how can it be that there is no application in which a No Objection Certificate is given
 aap sarkaar kah rahi hai ki isamen meri galati nahin he, kisi bhi cheez main unki galati nahin hoti he pradooshan main unki galati nahin hoti he, gande pani par unki koi galati nahin he
 The question is not whether this building is legal or not
 yah building special protection act ke tahat cover he
 But the fire department had to go and see what the danger of fire there was
 keval yahi nahin aap dilli ghumie saikadon jagah aapako aisi imaarte milengi jahaan par aag lagane kaa khatra tay he
 i have already said that whenever there are big incidents of fire, soon after that you set up an investigation team but the question is what do you learn from such incidents? 
 unhone kaha ki main blem game nahin kar rahaa hum agar jaanch main nikalataa he ki kisi or kii galati he to use khilaaf karrwai karo lekin ek cheez jo ankhon ko saamne najar aa rahi he ki taare you latak rahi hai neeche bachche gum rahe hai, kahin spark ho gaya kahin koi durghatana ho gai, usee kii main baat kar rahaa hum isamen koi political time scoring nahin he
 NDTV asked him if the MCD had no responsibility? To this Hardeep Puri replied that the people of the Municipal Corporation had gone there for sealing on Friday
 shuukravaar ko kyon gaye unako kya koi abhas tha ki kuch hone vaala he us chiz ko chhodie jaanch hone dijie
 i am not saying that blame or not blame the MCD or accuse the DDA or not
 vahaan 5 manjila building bani hui he vah special protection act ke tahat cover ho rahi he
 But i am saying that whenever such a bad event happens, we sit down with small things
 are badi tasviir dekho
 Everything i said yesterday was not a game of blem

 unhone TODAY ko kaha- ''maine dekha ki wo mere paas aa rahaa he to main man hi man chhataavaa kar rahaa tha ki maine darvaja kyon band nahin kiya
 '' Thank you # Aljazeera
 The door was meant to be locked! But perhaps it's good to have some levity in the midst of tackling some serious issues

 At the same time, he also demanded Islamabad to end its relations with the government there and close its embassy here
 tippaniyan The banned tehreek-e-taliban described themselves as protectors of Muslims in Myanmar and said in a statement that 'we will avenge your blood
 ’ taliban ke pravaktaa ehshanulla ehsaan ne maang kii he ki pakistan kii sarkaar myama se sambandh khatm kar le or islamabad main uskaa duutavas band kar de

 ’ myama ke duutavas se koi jawaab nahin aayaa he or tippanee ke liye iske adhikariyon se sampark nahin ho sakaa
 Probably for the first time TTP has commented on an issue which is not related to Pakistan and Afghanistan
 pratibandhit taharik e taliban ne khud ko myama main muslimon kaa sangrakshak bataaya or ek bayaan main kaha ki ‘ham aapke khun kaa badla lenge
 'taliban spokesman Ehshanullah Ehsan has demanded that Pakistan's government withdraw ties with Myanmar and close its embassy in Islamabad
 ehsaan ne ek bayaan main kaha, ‘ham na keval burma ke hiton ko chot pahunchaayenge balki burma ke pakistani (mitron) par bhi hamalaa karenge
 There has been no response from Myanmar's Embassy and its officials could not be contacted for comment
 sambhavat: pehali baar titipi ne aise mudde par tippanee kii he jo pakistan or afghanistan kaa nahin he

 bhaajapa pramukh amit shah par paroksh hamalaa bolte hue shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ne kaha ki unhone rajnath singh se kaha tha ki ve maharashtra vidhansabha chunaav tak bhaajapa adhyaksh bane rahen or yadi kaman unke haath main rahati to gathbandhan nahin tuutata
 Thackeray also said that he had contacted Rajnath Singh, Sushma Swaraj and senior party leader LK Advani during the ongoing seat sharing discussion with the BJP and apprised them of the situation
 unhone kaha, 'maine rajnath singh se kaha tha ki maharashtra vidhansabha chunaav tak bhaajapa adhyaksh bane rahen
 If he were, he would have kept us together
 ' thakare ne ek news channel se kaha, 'modi ko pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar namit karne ke liye bhaajapa sansadeey board ke faisle se ek din purv unhone mujhe yah bataane ke liye phone kiya tha ki unke naam kii ghoshnaa hogi or unhone hamaara samarthan maanga
 i supported it
 vah aise vyakti hai jo chizon ko jodakar rakh sakate hai
 ' unhone kaha, 'maine adwani ji tak ko, jo kuch ho rahaa tha uske bare main bataane ke liye phone kiya or unhone bhi yah kaha ki yadi gathbandhan tuutata he to yah sahi nahin hoga
 i told him that if the alliance breaks, please forgive me
 ' Uddhav Thackeray said that just as Shah had said at a rally in Kolhapur that the next government in Maharashtra would belong to the BJP, it was clear that the BJP did not want Shiv Sena as an ally
 shivasena netaa ne kaha ki pehle bhi aisa hua he ki gathbandhan main tanaav tha lekin divangat pramod mahajan or gopinath munde jaise 'samajhadaar' netaaon ko pataa tha ki chizon ko kitna kheenchna he
 He said, 'my intention was never to break the alliance
 jab mahajan or munde gathbandhan sambandhi muddon ko dekh rahe the to chijen acchhee thim
 When people appointed from Delhi came and started the conversation, things went wrong
 ' Thackeray said, 'amit Shah told me that Om Mathur (BJP leader) has been appointed for talks
 maathur ne kaha ki hamen sansadeey board ne kaha he ki yaa to baraabar yaa kuch nahin
 i told him that the BJP Parliamentary Board can decide your seats, not mine
 ' On the issue of the resignation of Anant Geete, the only minister on behalf of Shiv Sena in the Narendra Modi government, Thackeray said that he would talk to the Prime Minister about this

 Former Law Minister Ram Jethmalani has once again launched a scathing attack on Finance Minister Arun Jaitley
 jethmalani ne kaha ki jetali piem narendra modi ke liye 'aapadaa' kii tarah hai
 Well-known advocate said that you will see, one day Arun Jaitley will have to go to jail
 kabhi bijepi main shaamil rahe jethmalani ab arvind kejariwal ke saath hai
 Jethmalani is appearing for Kejriwal in a defamation case filed against Arun Jaitley on six AAP leaders including Kejriwal

 In an interview to a Marathi channel, Jethmalani said that the respect i had for PM Narendra Modi is completely gone because he is supporting a 'criminal'
 jethmalani ne kaha ki modi or bijepi ko isaki keemat chukaani hogi

 ram jethmalani beete kai saalon se arun jetali kaa virodh karte rahe hai
 It is believed that the post of Law Minister was snatched from Jethmalani in the Vajpayee government due to Jaitley
 upiesarkaar kekarykaal ke dauraan sibiai ke nideshak ke taur par ranjit sinha ko niyukt kiye jane par bhi jethmalani ne sushamaa or arun jetali kii aalochana kii thi

 The success of this effort can be gauged from the fact that, in big cities, the candidates who are preparing for the competitive examination are returning to Tikamgarh
 tikamgarh, bundelkhand kaa abhavagrast jila he, jahaan suvidhaon ke naam par rail line ko chhodkar vartmaan main aisa kuch bhi nahin he, jiske kaaran is jile ko vishisht pahchaan mili
 Special facilities are also not available here in the education sector
 yahi kaaran he ki, yahaan ke adhikansh chaatr hair secondary, snaatak karne ke baad pratiyogi pariksha kii taiyaari ke liye dilli, bhopal, indore or gwalior jaise shaharon kaa rukh karte hai
 District Collector Saurabh Kumar Suman has started the initiative to prepare for the examination of MP Public Service Commission and Union Public Service Commission

 The District Magistrates themselves teach the students every morning in the local agricultural college building through the society
 unke saath i-gavarnes ke sahaayak prabandhak anupam dikshit or piessi kii topper anuvibhageeya adhikari vandana rajput bhi koching detii hai
 The district administration took the help of social site Facebook to spread information about its initiative to the students and their families
 baahar padhane gaye chaatro ko afasaron kii koching kii jaankaree mili, to unhen laga ki, jab unke ghar main hi pratiyogita pariksha kii koching iske safal pratibhaagi de rahe hai to unhone tikamgarh lautne kaa man bana liya
 After graduating in engineering, Shubham Pathak, who went to Delhi to prepare for UPSC, came back to know about it
 unhone bataaya ki, unhen jab tikamgarh main koching kii jaankaree mili, to turant ghar laute
 The way of coaching collector, SDM and other senior officers is very good here
 isi tarah indore main saal 2016 se piessi pariksha kii taiyaari kar rahi bi tech nikita jain jile main hi utkrisht koching kii jaankaree milte hi ghar laut aayi hai or yahaan koching le rahi hai
 Nikita believes that the experience of collector, deputy collector and SDM will definitely benefit her through this coaching
 vahiin, ek ejineering college main professor or tikamgarh nivasee pranit khare piessi kii taiyaari ke liye dilli chale gayi the, lekin vahaan fees zyada hone kii vajah se vah ek saal main hi waapas laut aae
 Now they too have reached there after getting information about coaching of Tikamgarh district administration

" lekin iske liye vyapak vichaar vimarsh kii jarurat he or ise ek sansadeey samiti ko bhejnaa hoga
 In the bill, the daily allowance of members has been increased from one thousand rupees to two thousand rupees and both the constituency and office expenditure allowances have been increased from 20 thousand rupees to 45-45 thousand rupees

" yah koi pechida mudda nahin he tathaa sarkaar ko monsoon satr kii samaapti se purv isaki ghoshnaa kerani chahie
 The senior BJP leader said that many times mps have been asking to increase their salary and thus making open demand for better increment is not a 'right situation' according to them
 vidheyak pesh karte hue bansal ne sweekaar kiya ki vishesh panel gathit karne main ‘deree hui he’ or ise sadan ke sabhi pakshon se vichaar vimarsh ke jariye ‘behad jald’ kiya jayega
 Taking part in the discussion, Raghuvansh Prasad Singh of RJD and Sudip Bandopadhyay of Trinamool Congress termed the Left parties' walkout as' double standards' and said that these members should not take the increased salary till a special mechanism is established

 shastri ne kaha, vah bhookha hoga
 He would be really hungry
 yadi australia unhen pehle do maichon main ran banane detaa he to yah tendulkar ke liye bahut badi siries hogi
 He said, he will be a bit nervous initially but if he scores 50, 60 or 70 in the first two innings then it will be a very big series for him
 tendulkar ne test maichon par dhyaan kendrit karne ke liye disambar main ekadivasiy maichon main sanyas le liya tha
 The star batsman has not scored a century from the last 31 Test innings and 17 matches
 lekin shastri kaa maananaa he ki tendulkar ab bhi bhartiya ballebaaji linep main sarvshereshth hai
 He said, England bowled well, but i think they have got two months' rest and they will have used it for the preparations

 Priyanka Chopra was in the US for a long time and was involved in shooting Hollywood film Baywatch and American TV show Quantico

 Which was released about three and a half years ago
 lambey vakt baad priyanka kii vaapasi itani buree hogi isaki ummid phans nahin kar rahe the
 But what is the reason that made Priyanka Chopra's comeback so badly? Remember that Priyanka Chopra was going to return to Bollywood after a long time from India
 lekin apni shaadi ko vajah bataate hue unhone achaanak film se walkout kar liya
 He took this decision at a time when the news of Priyanka Chopra's return with Salman Khan had become common
 priyanka ke achaanak liye is faisle se salmaan khan se lekar producers tak sabhi naaraaz the or unke bayanon main ye baat saaf najar ai
 Salman Khan expressed anger against Priyanka in many places and producers said that Priyanka did not even think it necessary to tell her
 isse na sirf salmaan khan ke phans priyanka ke khilaaf ho gaye balki unke khud ke phans main bhi priyanka kii image negative hone lagi
 Apart from this, being cut off from Bollywood for so long was also a loss deal for Priyanka
 kyonki unka fain base yahaan kamjor pad gaya tha
 It is believed that his decision to leave India and go abroad and make a fresh start in Hollywood instead of being an established actress in India has been wrong

 But the middle class has suffered another setback, domestic cylinder prices have gone up as soon as GST is implemented
 ab logon ko LPG silendar lene ke liye 32 rupee zyada kharch karne honge
 Actually, these prices will increase with the implementation of GST and reduction in subsidy
 angreji akhbaar ikonimic times ke mutabik, jiesti ke lagu hone se pehle kai rajyon ko alpiji ke liye tex nahin dena hota tha, lekin kuch rajyon main is par 2-4 pratishat kaa waite lagata tha
 But now because LPG is placed in a 5% slab, its price is increasing by Rs 12-15
 iske alaava june se hielpiji kii sabsidimein bhi kuch katautee kii gai he

 iskaa matlab jiesti or sabsidi ke kaaran aam aadmi kii jeb par sidhe taur par 30-32 rupee kaa asar pad rahaa he
 However, with the coming of GST, there has been a reduction of up to Rs 69 in commercial LPG cylinders
 isse pehle commercial silendar par 22
 The tax used to be up to 5%, but now it has been kept in the 18% slab, due to which the prices are reduced

 So that it can be clear that if this is murder then who and why Pradeep was killed

 The Congress and JDS coalition government of Karnataka is celebrating Tipu Jayanti today (10 November)
 bijepi or dakshinpanthi sanghathan karnataka sarkaar ke is kaarykram kaa joardaar virodh kar rahe hai
 In such a situation political opposition to the BJP is also being removed
 karnataka main congress ke tatkaaleen siem siddharmaiya ne 2015 main karnataka main tipu jayanti kii shuruyaat kii thi
 Although he argued for the memorial of Karnataka's legacy behind it, political analysts say that it was his motive to draw Muslim voters towards him
 bataa den ki 18veen sadi ke mysore ke shaskatipu sultanko bhartiya muslim samaaj apana nayak maanata rahaa he
 He exemplifies Indian national unity
 congress ne bhi tipu janyati manaane ke peeche yahi tark diya he
 BJP has been opposing this event from the very beginning
 bijepi tipu sultan ko kattar muslim shaasha bataati he
 BJP and right-wing organizations say that Tipu Sultan broke temples and got Hindus converted on a large scale
 2015 main jaise hi congress ne is jayanti ko manaane kaa elaan kiya bijepi virodh main kud padi or lagaataar ise congress kaa tushtikaran kahati rahi he
 In the current political scenario, raising that issue has become a major political compulsion of BJP
 saal 2017 main tamaam koshishon ke baavjood bijepi satta main nahin aa saki
 BJP became the largest party, but could not regain lost power in 2012
 is chunaav ke baad bijepi ko takkar dene ke liye congress or jedies ek saath ho gayi
 BJP has fallen alone in the state
 raajnneetik panditon ke mutabik rojgaar, bhrashtachar, notebandi, kheti, sibiai, arabiai jaise muddon par centre main ghiri bijepi ke liye dharm kii sharan main janaa bijepi kii majaburi he
 This is the only issue in which BJP has an upper hand
 idhar rajya main jedies-congress kii sarkaar banane ke baad janata par inaki pakad lagaataar majboot hui he
 The results of the recent byelection bear witness to this
 yahaan par bijepi ko paanch siton par 4-1 se haar jhelni padi
 BJP also lost the Bellary seat in this by-election
 bijepi kaa pichley 15 saalon se is seat par kabja tha
 The Congress remained in power at the Center for 10 years but could not win this seat, but when jds-congress joined hands, this fort of BJP collapsed
 vishleshak maanate hai ki karnataka se mil rahe siyaasi sanketon ne bijepi ko dharmik golbandi par majaboor kiya he
 Before Lok Sabha elections 2019, the politics of religion is in full swing in the country
 kerala main sabarimala, uttar bharat main ram mandir ko lekar bijepi ke tevar sakht hai
 In Karnataka, BJP has got the issue in the form of Tipu Sultan Jayanti to prepare his political land
 kumaraswami ne banaai durirajya kii satta kaa sukh bhoga rahi jedies hameshaa se is aayojan se dur rahi he
 If sources are to be believed, the Gowda family was not in favor of the event from the beginning, but the complexities of the coalition government forced them to give the green signal to the event
 haalanki siem echdi kumaraswami khud is aayojan se dur rahenge
 The BJP has also attacked the JDS on this matter
 bijepi saansad shobhaa karandalaaje ne kaha he ki tipu jayanti kaa aayojan kar siddharmaiya ne apni satta kho di ab aisa hi unke saath hone vaala he jo tipu janyati manaane ja rahe hai
 Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) supremo Lalu Prasad has been ranting against Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar for a long time
 lalu ne is baar kaha he ki nitish ke naa koi usul hai or naa hi koi siddhant

 is par nitish ke ghor virdohi lalune un par kataaksh karte hue centre sarkaar kii ore ishaara karte hue kaha ‘baandhakar rakhen kahin chatak na jaae, maan liya he to jaakar le aaen
 Asked about the possibility of Nitish going with the Congress, leaving the BJP in the next Lok Sabha elections, Lalu said that what he meant by the principle, Nitish can go with anyone
 nitish ke bare main lalu ne kaha, 'unka naa to koi usul or naa hi koi siddhant he, ve kisi ke saath bhi ja sakate hai, unhen to keval gaddi (satta) chahie

 How safe is Indian Railways for women
 yahi jaanane kii koshish kii he
 The question is very big, the question is related to your safety, the question is related to the safety of women, the question is that the fear which follows you in the cities, is that fear, that fear leaves you in the Indian Railways? How safe are you as a woman, if you ride Indian Railways? Aajtak reporter Anjana Kashyap on the journey of about 1000 km in delhi-patna Rajdhani Express tried to know, understand and feel that if you travel on Indian Railways as a woman, how much your safety is taken care of 
 dilli se patna ke root par hazaron log rozaana safar karte hai
 Aajtak reporter Anjana Kashyap also traveled in second class of Rajdhani Express
 rajdhani express kaa second class ho to har koi andaaza yahi lagayegaa ki yahaan to suraksha ko lekar dikkat nahin honi chahie
 The security guards of the railway should also be properly patrolled
 lekin ajtak ne jab haqiqat jaani, sachai kii tah tak pahunchaa or phir saamne aayaa chaunkaane vaala sach
 Promise security is done in Indian Railways, but is it true? The truth of this train running on iron wheels is that women cannot travel without worry
 aankade bataate hai, pichley ek saal main, 11 balaatkaar kii ghatnaayen huin, or 76 chhedhkhani kii ghatnaayen aisi hi trainon main huin hai
 Hopefully, all these railway ministers Pawan Basal will also be watching and women also want to convey this message to the railway minister
 is desh main baat mahilaon ke shashaktikaun kii hoti he lekin suraksha ke naam par bhartiya rail fail hoti najar aa rahi he
 So these women want to open the eyes of the Railway Minister
 mahila suraksha ke liye railway police to bana di gai or kanoon bhi ban gaya, lekin kya koi arpeef kaa jawan dibbon main gasht lagaataa he?jab raat ke andhere main train steshnon par rukati hui patna kii ore bad rahi thi, hamaari team bina palken jhapakaae, is intazaar main baithi thi ki kahin se kisi darvaaze se koi railway police kaa jawan dastak de, apni duty nibhaae
 But our hope remained only hope

 Let me tell you that Indian Railways need about 3 lakh RPF personnel
 railway ko 75000 arpeef jawan rakhane kii ijazat mili hui he, isamen bhi 14 hazaar se zyaada javaanon kii jagah khaali he
 RPF has the responsibility of security in 3 and a half thousand trains
 ham aapako ye bhi bataa den ki 288 yatriyon kii suraksha kaa zimmaa ek arpeef ke jawan par he
 The truth of the safety of women in the world's largest railway system was opening on the route from Delhi to Patna
 sawaal ye he ki kya un ladakiyon kaa safar mahfuz he, jo bihar se dilli main padhai ke liye aati hai
 Are those women safe traveling from Bihar to Delhi for jobs
 kya wo bhartiya rail main bedauf safar kar sakati hai
 Before the budget, women are questioning Railway Minister Pawan Bansal

 As the Congress forms the government in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, the Rajya Sabha will also increase in strength
 vahiin, in nateezon ke aadhaar par aane vaale samay main bijepi ko kaaphi nuksaan hone vaala he
 Out of 26 seats in the three states, it currently has 21 seats, but by 2022, BJP will be reduced to 12 or 13 seats
 madhya pradesh main phaayde main rahegi congressrajyasabha ke liye 2020 main madhya pradesh se 3 siton ke liye chunaav hoga
 At present, BJP has 2 seats and Congress has 1 seat
 isamen congress ko 2 siten aasaani se mil jaaengi, jabaki bijepi ke khate main 1 seat jaaegi
 Similarly, there will be election for 3 seats in the year 2022
 in 3 siton main is samay 2 bijepi or 1 congress ke paas he
 Then Congress will get 2 seats and BJP will get 1 seat
 is tarah 2022 tak madhyapradesh main bijepi ke paas 11 main se 6 siten hongi to vahiin congress ke paas 5 saansad honge
 In Rajasthan, the Congress has zero member strength in the Rajya Sabha at present, but according to the number of mlas in the new assembly, its two members will be in the Rajya Sabha in 2020
 bijepi ko rajasthan se 2020 main keval 1 seat hi milegi
 In Rajasthan, 3 seats are vacant in 2020
 inamen vidhayakon kii sankhya bal ke hisaab se congress ko 2 or bijepi ko 1 seat mil sakati he
 However, the Congress will have to resort to independents and allies for the second seat
 isi tarah se 2022 main rajya main 4 siten khaali ho rahi hai
 In this, the Congress will get 2 seats easily while the third seat will be contested
 vahiin, bijepi ko 1 seat milegi or duusari seat ke liye use 7 or vidhayakon kii jarurat padegi
 In such a situation, it may be interesting to contest for the fourth seat in the state
 is tarah rajasthan main 2022 tak congress shunya se badhkar 4 se 5 rajyasabha saansad vaali party ho jaaegi
 BJP is losing in Chhattisgarh BJP is directly losing in Chhattisgarh
 2020 main rajya kii 2 siton ke liye chunaav hoga
 In which Congress and BJP currently hold 1-1 seats
 2020 main ye donon siten congress ke khate main chali jaaengi
 Similarly, in the elections held in 2022, both the seats will go to the Congress account
 inamen bhi is samay ek seat congress or ek bijepi ke paas he
 These mps elected this year are out of danger, the equation may change for many mps from Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh in the next five years in the Rajya Sabha elections
 vahiin kuch saansadon ke liye agle 5 saal surakshit hai
 These include Saroj Pandey of BJP from Chhattisgarh, Thawarchand Gehlot of BJP from Madhya Pradesh, Dharmendra Pradhan, Kailash Soni, Ajay Pratap Singh and Rajmani Patel of Congress
 yahi sthiti rajasthan se bhaajapa ke bhupendra yadav, kirodilal meena or madanlaal saini kii bhi he, jinka kaarykaal agle 5 saal tak surakshit he
 All these mps were elected in the April elections held this year
 gauratlab he ki madhyapradesh main 11, rajasthan main 10 or chhattisgarh main 5 rajyasabha sadsy hai
 BJP holds ten seats in the current Rajya Sabha
 madhyapradesh main 8 bijepi or 3 congress ke paas hai
 At the same time, Chhattisgarh has 3 BJP and 2 Congress Rajya Sabha mps
 iskaa matlab he ki in teen rajyon kii 26 siton main se 21 siten bijepi ke paas hai or sirf 5 siton par congress he lekin 2022 tak bijepi 12 yaa 13 siton par simat jaaegi
 In Dantewada district of Chhattisgarh, 7 soldiers were killed in a fierce attack by a Naxalite on a Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) patrol on Sunday night

 zimbabwe cricket team ke head coach hith stric or westeindies team ke head coach stuart lau, donon kii chahat he ki test kii ek pari main diares kii sankhya do se zyada kar di jaae
 Both of them said this after the recently concluded Test match between Zimbabwe and West Indies
 test match ke dauraan agar zimbabwe ke paas do se zyadaarivyuhote to vah jesan holder ko 11 ke nijee score par pavilion bhej diya hota
 Holder hit a century later, if the West Indies had a review, they could have won the match by dismissing Zimbabwe captain Graeme Krimer
 ieenes ke mutabik stuart lau ne kaha he, ki ‘camera lagane auratkanikako laane main kaaphi paisa khatm hota he, lekin hamane unka do baar galat tareeke se upyog kiya
 Stuart Law said, 'having a technique but not using it properly makes no sense to me
 hamen isamen zyada chaturaai baratarani padegi kyonki hamaare paas sirf do rivyuu hote hai
 'streak also justified Stuart's point, saying,' You end up making a lot of money to bring this technology
 jo log dekh rahe the unhen pataa he ki galat faisle liye gaye
 This is an issue on which we should discuss how we can use such expensive technology well so that the right decisions can be taken
 ’ Whether to install CCTV cameras in Delhi or buy arms, now the Delhi Police will not have to see the face of Delhi government
 kendriya grih mantralay ne dilli police ke adhikaron main ye badhotaree karke dilli kii sarkaar ko ek bada jhatka diya he
 Delhi Aaj Tak has that letter from the Ministry of Home Affairs, through which it has taken away all the rights of the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi and the Finance Department of the Government of Delhi
 bada masalaa yah he ki ab shila dikshit shaayad hi kabhi dilli police par apana adhikaar phir se jataa paaen
 You can show your bullying on the policemen by citing law and order
 vaise to pehle hi dilli kii police dilli sarkaar kii kam hi sunati he, lekin rahe-sahe adhikaron ko bhi kendriya grih mantralay ne dilli sarkaar ke haathon se chin liya he
 The Delhi Police has yet to go to the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi for all their needs , but now all the financial powers have either been given directly by the Ministry of Home Affairs to the Police Commissioner of Delhi or have kept it to themselves
 grih mantralay ne chitti likhakar jin adhikaron ko dilli ke uparajyapal se lene kaa faisla liya he, unamem sabhi kism ke gaiyr yojana kharch shaamil hai
 The Delhi Police will have full authority to purchase all types of arms
 dilli police ko ab steshnari par bhi manmarjee ke hisaab se kharch karne kii chhot hogi
 Police will no longer have to face anyone even for the purchase of tents and clothes
 yahaan tak ki suraksha ke lihaaj se kaaphi ahm maane jane vaale sisitivi camaron kii bhi khariddaari ab dilli police khud karegi
 The police commissioner may, on his own free will, undertake twenty-one trips a year to those officers who do not have the right to travel
 yani grih mantralay ne dil kholkar adhikaar police ko de die hai, lekin jaankaar itane adhikaar dene ko uchit nahin tehra rahe hai
 In this case, former Chief Secretary of Delhi, Omesh Sehgal, says that after giving the rights, there should be a system of checks and balances, because if it is not there, then there is more possibility of disturbances
 haalanki grih mantralay ne dilli sarkaar se adhikaar jarur chhine hai, lekin police kamishnar ke vittiya kaamkaaj par najar rakhane ke liye mantralay apana hi ek vittiya salaahkaar niyukt karegaa
 That is, the command of police rights has now gone directly to North Block

 greater noida ke dadri main akhlaaq kaa maaraa janaa mahaz haadasa tha yaa saazish yaa kuch or is par abhi jaanch chalegi or usase bhi lambii or usase pare bahes
 But this is an incident after which you, we should ask ourselves who we are after all
 
 
 pahchaan kya he hamaari
 
 
 Are you the mob that kills someone alone? isliye ki bheed main aapako taqatvar mahasoos hota he, jo akele main nahin hota
 That animal inside you gets a free hand to dance the orgy of hate, cruelty which civilization has been trying to make humans
 man ke kisi kone main koi choti si awaz aapako bataati he ki jo aap kar rahe hai galat he lekin bheed kuch or kah rahi he or is bheed se alag aap main himmat nahin he, bouna pate hai aap khud ko or is awaz ko dabaa dete hai
 Or do you stand with the crowd because you feel that if you are not with the crowd, then you will be targeted
 aap bheed kii krurta main isliye bhi shaamil hai kyonki bheed main kisi ek kii zimmedaari tay karnaa mushkil hota he or aapako lagata he ki jo bhi galat aap karenge uski koi javabdehi nahin hogi
 Or are you a spectator in this crowded playground, inciting you to a bloody game - with words, applause from applause
 
 
 asal main aap bheed se bhi zyada darpok hai
 
 
 Your mind also spreads the same cruelty, but you are happy to see someone else doing it
 kyonki aap sirf bheed kii kerani nahin dekhte, aap kanakhiyon se surakshit dubak lene ke raaston ko bhi dekhte hai
 You are probably among those who would kick a stray dog on the road and smile with satisfaction
 aap sirf or sirf dar se bamushkil insaan hone kaa dhong rachaa rahe hai
 You can also be a silent spectator
 
 
 sab dekh kar chup rah jane vaale
 You do not know whether the act of the crowd is right or wrong because no one knows if you do not say anything
 aap bhi nishcint hai kyonki har chiz kaa jawaab hoga aapke paas ki hamane to kuch kaha tak nahin
 This is the case, not even said
 sahi maan rahe hai to bhi dar, galat maan rahe hai to bhi dar
 Fear even one step ahead, fear even one step back
 dhyaan rakhiegaa kahin dar se hi kisi din jaan naa chali jaae, wo jaan jise itnaa sahej rahe hai
 But wait
 
 
 aap sab kii or bhi to pahchaan hogi
 
 
 There will be different communities, there will be different castes, there will be students, there will also be leaders, party workers, some dukadars, some agriculturalists, some engineers and so-called journalists
 in pahachaanon par khatra mandaraata lagata hoga kabhi, to kabhi bheed ban kar, kabhi uksaate darshak banakar, kabhi mook darshak ban kar khatre ko khatm karte honge
 No, i have not forgotten women
 aap bhi hai in sab main
 Those who have a long-standing relationship with pain
 
 Often men get this pain only
 
 
 pita, pati, betaa
 
 
 But for these, you give up your natural beauty
 yaa aapkaa khud kaa swaarth he, dar he
 
 
 If they do not support them, then who will bear the food and expenses, they will not be taken out of the house, they will not be left alone
 vaise ek khooni khel soshal media main bhi chalata he
 
 
 The roles are similar
 
 
 koi chhip kar, koi khul kar hamale karata he awaz dabaane ke liye
 You know kehane kii bhi zarurat nahin
 The comments puuchhie na khud se koun hai aap inamen se? Do humans still find themselves? kya aap wo bheed hai jo kisi akele ko toh kar maarthi he
 Because in the crowd you feel powerful, which is not alone
 aapke andar ke us jaanavar ko khuli chhot mil jaati he nafrat kaa, krurta kaa nanga naach naachne ke liye jise sabhyataa insaan banane kii koshish karti rahi he
 a small voice in any corner of the mind tells you that what you are doing is wrong but the crowd is saying something else and apart from this crowd you do not have the courage, dwarf finds you suppress yourself and this voice Huh
 yaa aap bheed ke saath isliye khadey hote hai ki aapako lagata he ki bheed ke saath nahin hue to uskaa nishaanaa ban jaaenge
 You are also involved in the cruelty of the crowd because it is difficult to decide the responsibility of any one in the crowd and you feel that whatever wrong you do, there will be no accountability
 yaa phir aap is bheed kii kridasthali main ek darshak hai, kisi khooni khel ke liye uksaate hue- shabdon se, taaliyon se tarif se
 
 
 Actually you are more timid than the crowd
 
 
 man aapkaa bhi usee krurta ko chatpataata he lekin aap kisi or ko ye karata dekh khush ho lete hai
 Because you don't just see the crowd doing it, you also see the way to take the safe from the bees
 aap shaayad un logon main se hai jo aate jate sadak par kisi aawaara kute ko laat maar kar santushti se muskaraa lete honge
 You are just pretending to be a human being only with fear
 aap mook darshak bhi ho sakate hai
 
 
 Those who see everything and stay silent pataa nahin bheed ke karname ko aap sahi maanate hai yaa galat kyonki aap kuch kehete nahin to kisi ko pataa nahin
 You are also sure because you will have the answer to everything that we have not even said anything
 yahi to baat he, kaha tak nahin
 Fear even if you believe right, fear even if you believe wrong
 ek kadam aage to bhi dar, ek kadam peeche to bhi dar
 Take care that some day you will not die due to fear, the life that you are saving so much
 lekin rukiye
 
 
 You all will be recognized even more
 
 
 alag alag kaum honge, alag alag jatiyaan bhi hongi, chaatr bhi honge, netaa bhi honge, party kaaryakarta, koi dukaadaar, koi khetihar hoga, koi ejeeniyar to koi tathakthith patrkaar bhi hoga
 These identities would seem to be threatening, sometimes by becoming crowds, sometimes by provoking spectators, sometimes by becoming silent spectators, to end the danger

 aksar mardon ke haathon hi miltaa he ye dard
 
 
 Father, husband, son
 
 
 lekin inhen ke liye aap apni naiysargik saumyata ko tilanjali de detii hai
 Or you have your own selfishness, fear
 
 
 ki inkaa saath nahin diya to koun uthayega khaanaa-kharchaa, kahin ghar se to baahar nahin kar die jaaenge, akele to nahin rah jaaenge
 By the way, a bloody game also plays on social media

 Needless to say

 kya sirf hawaii yatri hi yatri hai, rail yatri yatri nahin hai
 The question is simple that if a part of India makes a charter of the rights of air travelers, then why is there no such charter for railway passengers
 aapako darjanon aisi gadiyon ke naam bataa saktaa hum jo 10 se 60 ghante kii deree se chalati hai
 In what way are their passengers less than air travelers? agar hawaii yatriyon ko flite let hone par 10 se 20,000 tak kaa muawza milanaa chahie to rail main safar karne vaale yatriyon ko kyon nahin milanaa chahie
 Why should not the railway passengers also get the same facility that has been offered to the air passengers
 jayant sinha naagarik uddyan mantri hai or piyush goyal rail mantri hai
 Both are ministers in the same government
 jab jayant sinha itnaa dynamik faisla le sakate hai to dynamik rail mantri piyush goyal kyon nahin le sakate hai, wo chahen to paise kii bhi dikkat nahin hogi, kyonki is vakt vitt mantri bhi vahiin hai
 Even now it is not late, if Piyush Goyal wants, then the railway passengers can get damages in case of late trains, train cancellations
 vaise vitt mantri piyush goyal se yah bhi nivedan he ki ve esayssi sijiel 2016 batch ke 3287 naujavaanon ko jaldi niyukti patr dilava den, taaki ve sibiditi jaise vibhaagon main kaam kare desh ke liye zyaada se zyada kar sangrah kar saken
 Please listen to these young men
 3287 naujavaanon kii niyukti kaa maamla he
 We understand that expectations are burdened with you, but if you do not, then who will
 somvaar tak in sabhi ko niyukti patr mil janaa chahie
 The Ministry of Civil Aviation has created a charter for the rights of passengers
 air india ke alaava sari vimaan companiyaan privet hi hai
 If this charter comes into force, a new round of accountability will begin in domestic flights
 24 ghante pehle gharelu udaanon ke tikat cancil karaane par sara paisa waapas waapas hoga
 The entire money will be refunded if the ticket is canceled 24 hours in advance
 flite cancil hui, duusari flite chhot jaae, 12 ghante se zyaad kii deree par 20,000 muawza milegaa
 10,000 will be compensated for delay of 4 to 12 hours
 ab aap yah na sochen ki aandhi-tufaan yaa kohre ke kaaran deree hone par bhi milegaa
 It is proposed in the charter that compensation will be given for delay due to the same reasons, for which airline companies will be responsible
 hawaii yatriyon kii takalif ho yaa unhen koi bhi suvidha milti ho turant hedline ban jaati he
 Perhaps it will also be related to their economic status and news channels will believe that air travelers have a time, which they also have the responsibility to protect
 yadi jahaaz teramake par ek ghante se zyada deree se khadaa rah gaya tab yatriyon ko company kii taraf se free main naashtaa pani milegaa
 There is no quarrel or jealousy of air travelers
 magar rail yatriyon ne sarkaar kaa kya bigaada he ki ve 38-38 ghante kii let se train main safar karte hai, unhen kuch nahin miltaa he
 There is a provision to return full fare after delay of 3 hours
 railway bataa de ki kitne yatri clem karte hai or railway ne kitna kiraaya waapas kiya he
 Recently, Bhagalpur Garib Rath reached Delhi 38 hours late from Patna
 iske yatriyon ko kitna muawza milanaa chahie
 There is not even a fantasy of more than 24 hours in the charter of air passengers, but rail passengers are suffering a delay of 50 50 hours
 kya inhen railway kii taraf se free main naashtaa pani or 10 hazaar nahin milanaa chahie
 When the government itself cannot provide this facility to its passengers, then why does it expect this from the airlines
 or jab vah vimaan companiyon ko dene ke liye baadhya kar sakati he to vah khud rail yatriyon ko kyon nahin detii he
 May 19 Anand vihar-bhagalpur Garibrath reached Bhagalpur with a delay of 29 hours 10 minutes
 22 may ke din chalane vaali yahi train cancil kar di gai, yatriyon kaa kaaphi nuksaan hua
 Due to our rail series, there has been a lot of improvement in the timing of Freedom Fighter Express, patna-kota Express
 50 se 60 ghante kii deree se chalane vaali patna-kota express 20 or 22 may ko patna se rhite time khuli he
 Travelers are not sure at times
 swatantraaa senaanee express jab kisi stesan par samay par pahunch jaati he to yatri is gaadi ko aise dekhte hai jaise koi sapana dekh rahe hon
 But the experience of these trains is terrible
 amritsar se darbhanga ke bich jananaayak express chalati he
 All general bogeys are
 ye train bhi khub deree se chalati he
 Tell whether the railway will provide free breakfast water to the laborers riding in it
 23 may ko amritsar se darbhanga vaali train 11 ghante se zyada kii deree se chal rahi he
 The train on 22 May reached Darbhanga on 22 May with a delay of 22 hours 30 minutes
 patna stesan par habib ne kuch yatriyon se is sawaal par unki pratikriya maangi to unhone bhi yahi kaha ki yatri to rail ke bhi hai, let hone par unhen bhi muawaaja mili
 Ravi Prajapati has emailed us a copy of his RTI attached
 is par 6 march 2018 kii taarikh likhi he
 In this, Ravi had asked how many times the train 12367 and 12368 anand-vihar Bhagalpur Vikramashila Express reached its destination on time in the 2017-18 calendar year, then the answer is that train number 22367 Vikramshila Express at anand-vihar Terminal 2017-18 i have reached on time only 6 times
 train number 12368 apni manzil bhagalupar sirf ek baar rhite time pahunchi he
 This train has been late for 32-32 hours
 sochie is train ke yatriyon ko muaavja mili to kitna acha rahegaa
 Every right should be a common slogan
 jo hawaii yatri ko mili vahi rail yatri ko mili
 The problem of getting late is more in Indian Railways
 patna ke ek anbhavi travel agent anil ne bataaya ki ek railgadee jiske ravaanaa hone kaa samay subah 10 baje kaa he
 Now its chart will be made four hours before the right time
 maan lijie train 20 ghante let ho gai
 You would like a train ticket canceled
 to aap subah 10 baje ke aadha ghanta pehle hi cancil kara sakate hai
 That is, half an hour before the original time
 uske baad cancel nahin kara sakate hai
 Even then you come to know that the train will not open at 10 o'clock in the morning and you want to cancel, then the money is received through the train depository Receipt TDR
 agent kehete hai ki bahut kam logon kaa paisa waapas aata he or wo bhi kabhi samay par nahin aata
 Arrives several months later
 railway is maamle main apni sthiti or spasht kar sakati he
 If that's the case then that's really sad
 train let bhi chale or cancil hone kaa vikalp bhi na rahe yah acchhee baat nahin he
 We boarded the Railradar at 3
46 pm on 23 May
 railyatri
 Checked in, then 70 percent of the trains were late and 30 percent were running at that time
 ye rose kaa haal he
 Now we want to show a video of Information and Broadcasting Minister Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore
 sena or khilaadi prishthbhumi se hone ke kaaran vah hameshaa feet hi dikhte rahe hai
 It's a good thing
 pehle aap video dekhie soochna prasaaran mantri se chaar saal pehle pradhanmantri narendra modi ne maai clin india hashtag naam se chalange diya tha
 He used to tag nine people on Twitter, further nine people would also tag any nine
 unhone isaki shuruyaat The day was 2 October 2014
 saal main 9 ko diya tha
 Sachin Tendulkar, Anil Ambani, Salman Khan, Priyanka Chopra, Kamal Haasan, Mridula Sinha, Ramdev, Tarak Mehta were challenged by the team of Chashma
 iske baad kai log dekha dekhi chalange karne lage
 Some of the pictures also became disputed, but at that time people took pictures of cleanliness and also tweeted
 bharat main isaki shuruyaat bhartiya rail main hui
 When someone used to leave it in the postcard saying that the goddess would have to be compelled to not reach so many people
 ye isi pattern par shuru hua tha
 Well, this challenge of the Prime Minister is cold now
 us samay jo log brands ambesader bane the, unamem se kai ab is maamle main kam hi sakriy honge
 Rathod sahib challenged Hrithik Roshan, Virat Kohli and Saina Nehwal to say that we are fit then India is fit
 ye teenon pehle hi feet hai magar rathod chaahate hai ki ye sabhi apane fitness ke video or pikchar karen or apane phans ko feet rahane kii chunauti den
 The story of his fitness continues to be published in magazines, in this interview, journalists keep asking the same, so the fan will know
 feet hona zaruri he
 The Indian government spent a lot on the promotion of yoga, yet Rajyavardhan Rathore has to give up the challenge of fitness leaving the original work of his ministry, the reason for this will be known
 behatar hota ki ve apane sahyogiyon ko ye chalange dete na ki jo pehle se feet hai unhen
 Many mps and ministers and i too are in dire need of fitness
 kuch mantri or saansad fitness kaa khyaal bhi rakhte hai
 But there is a criticism of this
 duniya bhar main isaki aalochana kii jaati he
 The pressure that is put on a boy or girl in a particular way of fitness, makes him ill in another way
 aap iske chakkar main khaanaa pinaa chhod dete hai
 Want to be what the model looks like in TV
 lagate he usee kii nakal karne
 Hopefully you viewers will understand its danger and the minister may not have had this motive
 mantri ji kaa fitness nayaa nahin he, isliye prabhavit hone kii baat nahin he
 Yes, there should be someone who comes from 90 kg to 60 kg and if we promote yoga from gym to talk, then the matter should be made
 magar maine ise ek khaas makasad se dikhaaya he
 If Information Broadcasting Minister Rajyavardhan Rathore believes so much in his fitness, he should also pay attention to the fitness of the system
 esayssi siechaesel 2015 kii pariksha kaa rigelt agsat 2017 main aa gaya tha
 Due to our job series, several thousand students got appointment letters in many departments
 us dauraan hamane film division ke 29 chaatro kaa maamla bhi uthaaya
 It was expected that he would get the appointment letter but has not received it till date
 yahi nahin diarectorat aaf field publicity main bhi 12 noujvaan niyukti patr kaa intazaar kar rahe hai
 If the minister uses his super fitness to take news of these two departments, then there will be happiness in the house of 41 youth
 mantri bhi feet rahen or mantralay bhi feet rahe ye naaraa hona chahie
 The comments mantriyon kaa mul kaam he wo sabase pehle hona chahie
 Now you see 3287 youth have been elected to Income Tax Department
 teen hazaar se zyada kii sankhya hone ke baad bhi ye das maheene se niyukti patr kaa intazaar kar rahe hai
 One, it takes two to two years to test, and if you have to wait for ten months after passing, then what will happen to them
 kya piyush goyal unki chintaa dur nahin kar sakate
 This is the kind of India that ministers are doing pushups to make fit and are tweeting videos
 or usee bharat ke naujavaanon ke gaal aant bahen sab suukh ke kakadi ho gai hai ki kab sarkaar niyukti patr degi
 Meanwhile, a liter of petrol in Parbhani in Maharashtra has increased to 86 rupees 68 paise
 kai log vipaksh ko dosha de rahe hai ki vah mudda nahin uthaa rahaa he
 If you miss the opposition this much, then we show you an old statement by Prakash Javadekar
 jo soshal media par khub chal rahaa he
 He made this statement while in opposition
 kya acha hota
 Even if Prakash ji were in opposition even today, it would have been good or Prakash ji would have been finance minister instead of human resource, it would have been good
 kitne aatmavishvaas se kah rahe hai ki sarkaar chaahe to mumbai main 36 rupee prati litre petrol mil saktaa he, dilli main 34 rupee prati litre mil saktaa he
 That is why you are missing the opposition, not the government
 us vakt prakaash ji ne excise duty kii tulana jajia kar se kii thi
 At least they should have abolished this jizya tax
 unhen bataanaa chahie ki upie ne jo jajia lagaaya tha wo endie main kyon chal rahaa he
 Jayant Sinha is the Minister of Civil Aviation and Piyush Goyal is the Minister of Railways
 donon ek hi sarkaar main mantri hai
 When Jayant Sinha can take such a dynamic decision, then why can't Piyush Goyal, the dynamic railway minister, take it, if he wants, then there will be no problem of money because the finance minister is also there at the moment
 ab bhi der nahin hui he, piyush goyal chahenge to rail yatriyon ko bhi hawaii yatriyon kii tarah train let hone, train cancel hone par harjaana mil saktaa he
 By the way, Finance Minister Piyush Goyal is also requested to get 3287 youths of SSC CGL 2016 batch appointed early, so that they can work in departments like CBDT to collect maximum tax for the country
 plis goyal ji in naujavaanon kii sun lijie
 3287 is a matter of appointment of youth
 ham samajhate hai ki aap par ummiido ko boj he magar aap nahin karenge to koun karegaa
 All of them should get appointment letters by Monday
 naagarik uddyan mantralay ne yatriyon ke adhikaar ke liye charter banaaya he
 All airlines are private except for Air India
 agar ye charter lagu hua to gharelu udaanon main javabdehi kaa nayaa daur shuru hoga
 All the money will be refunded on cancellation of tickets for domestic flights 24 hours earlier
 24 ghante pehle tikat cancil karaane par puraa kaa puraa paisa rifund ho jayega
 Flight canceled, missed another flight, will get 20,000 compensation for delay of more than 12 hours
 4 se 12 ghante kii deree hone par 10,000 muawza milegaa
 Now you do not think that there will be delays due to thunderstorms or fog
 charter main prastaavit he ki unheen kaarnon se deree hone par muawza milegaa, jiske liye airline companiyaan zimmedaar hongi
 Whether air travelers suffer or get any facility, it immediately becomes a headline
 shaayad iskaa sambandh inaki aarthik sthiti se bhi hoga or news channel yah maanate honge ki hawaii yatriyon ke samay kii keemat hoti he, jisaki raksha karne kii zimmedaari unki bhi he
 If the ship remained standing on the Tarmac for more than an hour, passengers would get free breakfast water from the company
 hawaii yatriyon se koi jhagada nahin he na hi unase irshyaa he
 But what the railway passengers have done to the government is that they travel in the train with a delay of 38-38 hours, they do not get anything
 3 ghante se deree ke baad phul kiraaya waapas hone kaa praavdhaan he
 Tell the railways how many passengers claim and how much fare the railways has refunded
 abhi haal hi main bhagalpur garib rath patna se dilli 38 ghante let pahunchi
 How much compensation should its passengers get
 hawaii yatriyon ke charter main to 24 ghante se zyada kii kalpana bhi nahin he, magar rail yatri to 50 50 ghante kii deree bhugat rahe hai
 Should they not get breakfast water and 10 thousand free from the railway side
 jab sarkaar khud apane yatriyon ko yah suvidha nahin de sakati he to phir vah vimaan companiyon se isaki ummid kyon karti he
 And when she can force the airlines to give them, why does she not give herself to the passengers
 19 may anand vihaar-bhagalpur garibarath 29 ghante 10 minute kii deree se bhagalpur pahunchi thi
 The same train which was running on the day of 22 May was canceled, there was a lot of loss of passengers
 hamaari rail siries ke kaaran swatantraaa senaanee express, patna-kota express ke samay main kaaphi sudhaar hua he
 The patna-kota Express, running late by 50 to 60 hours, is open from Patna on 20 and 22 May
 yatriyon ko kai baar yakeen nahin hota he
 When the freedom fighter express arrives on time at a station, passengers see this car as if they are dreaming
 magar in gadiyon kaa anubhav bhayanak he
 Jannayak Express runs between Amritsar to Darbhanga
 sari general bogi hoti he
 This train also runs very late
 bataaiye kya railway inamen savaar mazdooron ko free main naashtaa pani degi
 On May 23, the train from Amritsar to Darbhanga was running late by more than 11 hours
 22 may kii train 23 may ko 22 ghanta 30 minute kii deree se darbhanga pahunchi he
 At Patna station, Habib asked some passengers for their response to this question, then they also said that the passengers are also on the rail, they also get compensation when they are late
 ravi prajapati ne hamen email se apni lagaai hui ek artiai kii copy mail kii he
 The date of 6 March 2018 is written on it
 isamen ravi ne poocha tha ki 2017-18 ke calendar year main train 12367 or 12368 anand-vihaar bhagalpur vikramshila express kitni baar apni manzil par samay se pahunchi, to jawaab miltaa he ki train number 22367 vikramshila express anand-vihaar terminal par 2017-18 main maatr 6 baar samay par pahunchi he
 Train number 12368 has reached its destination Bhagalpur only once
 yah train 32-32 ghante tak let chali he
 Think how good it will be if the passengers of this train are compensated
 har adhikaar ek samaan kaa naaraa hona chahie
 The air passenger gets the same rail passenger
 let hone kii samasya bhartiya rail main zyada he
 Anil, an experienced travel agent from Patna, told that a train whose departure time is at 10 am
 ab iskaa chart rhite time ke chaar ghanta pehle ban jayega
 Suppose the train was late for 20 hours
 aap chahenge ki train kaa tikat cancel kara len
 So you can cancel half an hour before 10 am
 yani original time ke aadha ghanta pehle
 Cancellation cannot be done after that
 phir bhi aapako pataa chal jaataa he ki train subah 10 baje nahin khulegi or aap cancil karana chaahate hai to train dipalitary recipt tidiar ke jariye paisa waapas miltaa he
 Agents say that very few people get their money back and that too never comes on time
 kai maheene baad aata he
 Railways can further clarify their position in this matter
 agar aisa he to vaaki dukhad he
 It is not a good thing to train late and not have the option to be canceled

 This is a daily situation
 ab ham soochna or prasaaran mantri rajyavardhan singh rathod kaa ek video dikhaanaa chaahate hai
 Being from the army and sportsmen background, he has always looked fit
 yah acchhee baat he
 First you watch the video, four years before the Minister of Information Broadcasting, Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave a challenge named My Clean India hashtag
 ve twitor par nau logon ko tag karte the, aage ve nau log bhi kisi nau ko tag kar dete the
 They started it 2 aktubar 2014 ke din kii thi
 Gave 9 in the year
 sachin tendulkar, anil ambani, salmaan khan, priyanka chopra, camel hasan, mridula sinha, ramdev, tarak mehta kaa ulta chashma kii team ko chalange kiya tha
 After this, many people started doing challenges
 kuch tasviren vivaadit bhi ho gai magar us vakt logon ne saaf safai kii tasviren khinchaa kar twit bhi kar diya
 It started in India on the Indian Railways
 jab koi postcard main yah likhakar chhod jaataa tha ki itane logon ko nahin pahunchane par devi kaa kopbhaajan hona padegaa
 It started on this pattern
 khayr pradhanmantri kaa yah chalange ab thanda padaa chukaa he
 Many of those who had become brand ambassadors at that time would now be less active in this matter
 rathod sahab ruthik raushan, viraat kohli or cyna nehwal ko chalange diya ki ham feet to india feet
 All three are already fit, but Rathore wants them to do their fitness videos and pictures and challenge their fans to stay fit
 inke fitness kii kahani patrikaon main chhapati hi rahati he, inase intervyuu main patrkaar yahi sab poochhate rahete hai, isliye jo fain hoga unhen pataa bhi hoga
 It is important to be fit
 bharat sarkaar ne yoga ke prachaar prasar par kaaphi kharch kiya, phir bhi rajyavardhan rathod ko apane mantralay kaa mul kaam chhodkar fitness kaa chalange dena padaa he, isaki vajah vahi jaanate honge
 It would have been better if he had given this challenge to his colleagues and not to those who were already fit
 kai saansadon or mantriyon or mujhe bhi fitness kii sakht zarurat he
 Some ministers and mps also take care of fitness
 magar isaki ek aalochana he
 It is criticized worldwide
 fitness ko lekar ek khaas tarah se dikhne kaa jo dabaav ladkaa yaa ladki par banataa he, use duusari tarah se biimaar hi karata he
 You stop drinking food during its cycle
 tivi main jaisaa model dikhataa he vaisaa hi bananaa chaahate hai
 Looks like copying it
 ummid he aap darshak iske khatre ko samajhenge or mantri ji kaa bhi ye makasad nahin rahaa hoga
 The fitness of the minister is not new, so there is nothing to be impressed
 haa koi aisa ho jo 90 kilo se 60 kilo par aa jaae or yoga se lekar gym kaa prachaar kare to baat bhi bane
 But i have shown it with a special purpose
 agar soochna prasaaran mantri rajyavardhan rathod apane fitness main itnaa yakeen rakhte hai to unhen system ke bhi fitness par bhi dhyaan dena chahie
 The result of SSC CHSL 2015 examination came in August 2017
 hamaari naukari siries ke kaaran bahut se vibhaagon main kai hajaar chaatro ko niyukti patr mila
 During that time we also raised the case of 29 students of the film division
 ummid thi ki inhen niyukti patr mil jayega magar aaj tak nahin mila he
 Not only this, 12 youth are waiting for appointment letter in Directorate of Field Publicity
 agar mantri ji apane super fitness kaa istamaal karte hue in do vibhaagon kii khabar le len to 41 naujavaanon ke ghar main khushiyaan aa jaaengi
 The minister should also be fit and the ministry should also be fit
 tippaniyan The basic work of ministers is the first thing to be done
 ab aap dekhie 3287 noujvaan iskar vibhaag ke liye chune gaye hai
 Despite having a number of more than three thousand, they have been waiting for appointment letter for ten months
 ek to imtahaan dene main do do saal lag jate hai, doosraa paas hone ke baad agar das maheene kaa intazaar karnaa hoga to un par kya beetegi
 Can Piyush Goyal not take care of them? ye kaisaa bharat he jise feet banane ke liye mantri puddp kar rahe hai video banaakar twit kar rahe hai
 And the cheeks of the youth of the same India have become dry cucumber when the government will give the appointment letter
 is bich maharashtra ke parabhani main ek litre petrol 86 rupee 68 paise ho gaya he
 Many people are blaming the opposition for not raising the issue
 agar aap vipaksh ko itnaa hi miss kar rahe hai to ham aapako prakaash jaavdekar kaa ek purana bayaan dikhaate hai
 Which is going on well on social media
 yah bayaan unhone vipaksh main rahete hue diya tha
 What would have been better prakaash ji aaj bhi vipaksh main hote to wo acha hota yaa phir prakaash ji maanav sansaadhan kii jagah vitt mantri hote, wo acha hota
 How confident are the people saying that if the government wants, then Mumbai can get Rs 36 per liter of petrol, Delhi can get Rs 34 per liter
 tabhi aap log vipaksh ko miss kar rahe hai, sarkaar ko nahin
 At that time, Prakash ji compared excise duty to jizya tax
 kam se unhen is jajia kar ko samaapt karvaa dena chahie tha
 They should explain why the Jupia imposed by the UPA is running in the NDA
 naagarik uddyan mantralay ne yatriyon ke adhikaar ke liye charter banaaya he
 All airlines are private except for Air India
 agar ye charter lagu hua to gharelu udaanon main javabdehi kaa nayaa daur shuru hoga
 All the money will be refunded on cancellation of tickets for domestic flights 24 hours earlier
 24 ghante pehle tikat cancil karaane par puraa kaa puraa paisa rifund ho jayega
 Flight canceled, missed another flight, will get 20,000 compensation for delay of more than 12 hours
 4 se 12 ghante kii deree hone par 10,000 muawza milegaa
 Now you do not think that there will be delays due to thunderstorms or fog
 charter main prastaavit he ki unheen kaarnon se deree hone par muawza milegaa, jiske liye airline companiyaan zimmedaar hongi
 Whether air travelers suffer or get any facility, it immediately becomes a headline
 shaayad iskaa sambandh inaki aarthik sthiti se bhi hoga or news channel yah maanate honge ki hawaii yatriyon ke samay kii keemat hoti he, jisaki raksha karne kii zimmedaari unki bhi he
 If the ship remained standing on the Tarmac for more than an hour, passengers would get free breakfast water from the company
 hawaii yatriyon se koi jhagada nahin he na hi unase irshyaa he
 But what the railway passengers have done to the government is that they travel in the train with a delay of 38-38 hours, they do not get anything
 3 ghante se deree ke baad phul kiraaya waapas hone kaa praavdhaan he
 Tell the railways how many passengers claim and how much fare the railways has refunded
 abhi haal hi main bhagalpur garib rath patna se dilli 38 ghante let pahunchi
 How much compensation should its passengers get
 hawaii yatriyon ke charter main to 24 ghante se zyada kii kalpana bhi nahin he, magar rail yatri to 50 50 ghante kii deree bhugat rahe hai
 Should they not get breakfast water and 10 thousand free from the railway side
 jab sarkaar khud apane yatriyon ko yah suvidha nahin de sakati he to phir vah vimaan companiyon se isaki ummid kyon karti he
 And when she can force the airlines to give them, why does she not give herself to the passengers
 19 may anand vihaar-bhagalpur garibarath 29 ghante 10 minute kii deree se bhagalpur pahunchi thi
 The same train which was running on the day of 22 May was canceled, there was a lot of loss of passengers
 hamaari rail siries ke kaaran swatantraaa senaanee express, patna-kota express ke samay main kaaphi sudhaar hua he
 The patna-kota Express, running late by 50 to 60 hours, is open from Patna on 20 and 22 May
 yatriyon ko kai baar yakeen nahin hota he
 When the freedom fighter express arrives on time at a station, passengers see this car as if they are dreaming
 magar in gadiyon kaa anubhav bhayanak he
 Jannayak Express runs between Amritsar to Darbhanga
 sari general bogi hoti he
 This train also runs very late
 bataaiye kya railway inamen savaar mazdooron ko free main naashtaa pani degi
 On May 23, the train from Amritsar to Darbhanga was running late by more than 11 hours
 22 may kii train 23 may ko 22 ghanta 30 minute kii deree se darbhanga pahunchi he
 At Patna station, Habib asked some passengers for their response to this question, then they also said that the passengers are also on the rail, they also get compensation when they are late
 ravi prajapati ne hamen email se apni lagaai hui ek artiai kii copy mail kii he
 The date of 6 March 2018 is written on it
 isamen ravi ne poocha tha ki 2017-18 ke calendar year main train 12367 or 12368 anand-vihaar bhagalpur vikramshila express kitni baar apni manzil par samay se pahunchi, to jawaab miltaa he ki train number 22367 vikramshila express anand-vihaar terminal par 2017-18 main maatr 6 baar samay par pahunchi he
 Train number 12368 has reached its destination Bhagalpur only once
 yah train 32-32 ghante tak let chali he
 Think how good it will be if the passengers of this train are compensated
 har adhikaar ek samaan kaa naaraa hona chahie
 The air passenger gets the same rail passenger
 let hone kii samasya bhartiya rail main zyada he
 Anil, an experienced travel agent from Patna, told that a train whose departure time is at 10 am
 ab iskaa chart rhite time ke chaar ghanta pehle ban jayega
 Suppose the train was late for 20 hours
 aap chahenge ki train kaa tikat cancel kara len
 So you can cancel half an hour before 10 am
 yani original time ke aadha ghanta pehle
 Cancellation cannot be done after that
 phir bhi aapako pataa chal jaataa he ki train subah 10 baje nahin khulegi or aap cancil karana chaahate hai to train dipalitary recipt tidiar ke jariye paisa waapas miltaa he
 Agents say that very few people get their money back and that too never comes on time
 kai maheene baad aata he
 Railways can further clarify their position in this matter
 agar aisa he to vaaki dukhad he
 It is not a good thing to train late and not have the option to be canceled
 hamane 23 may kii dopaher 3 bajkar 46 minute par Railradar
 railyatri
 in par check kiya, to us vakt 70 pratishat railgadiyaan let thim or 30 fisadi samay se chal rahi thim
 This is a daily situation
 ab ham soochna or prasaaran mantri rajyavardhan singh rathod kaa ek video dikhaanaa chaahate hai
 Being from the army and sportsmen background, he has always looked fit
 yah acchhee baat he
 First you watch the video, four years before the Minister of Information Broadcasting, Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave a challenge named My Clean India hashtag
 ve twitor par nau logon ko tag karte the, aage ve nau log bhi kisi nau ko tag kar dete the
 They started it 2 aktubar 2014 ke din kii thi
 Gave 9 in the year
 sachin tendulkar, anil ambani, salmaan khan, priyanka chopra, camel hasan, mridula sinha, ramdev, tarak mehta kaa ulta chashma kii team ko chalange kiya tha
 After this, many people started doing challenges
 kuch tasviren vivaadit bhi ho gai magar us vakt logon ne saaf safai kii tasviren khinchaa kar twit bhi kar diya
 It started in India on the Indian Railways
 jab koi postcard main yah likhakar chhod jaataa tha ki itane logon ko nahin pahunchane par devi kaa kopbhaajan hona padegaa
 It started on this pattern
 khayr pradhanmantri kaa yah chalange ab thanda padaa chukaa he
 Many of those who had become brand ambassadors at that time would now be less active in this matter
 rathod sahab ruthik raushan, viraat kohli or cyna nehwal ko chalange diya ki ham feet to india feet
 All three are already fit, but Rathore wants them to do their fitness videos and pictures and challenge their fans to stay fit
 inke fitness kii kahani patrikaon main chhapati hi rahati he, inase intervyuu main patrkaar yahi sab poochhate rahete hai, isliye jo fain hoga unhen pataa bhi hoga
 It is important to be fit
 bharat sarkaar ne yoga ke prachaar prasar par kaaphi kharch kiya, phir bhi rajyavardhan rathod ko apane mantralay kaa mul kaam chhodkar fitness kaa chalange dena padaa he, isaki vajah vahi jaanate honge
 It would have been better if he had given this challenge to his colleagues and not to those who were already fit
 kai saansadon or mantriyon or mujhe bhi fitness kii sakht zarurat he
 Some ministers and mps also take care of fitness
 magar isaki ek aalochana he
 It is criticized worldwide
 fitness ko lekar ek khaas tarah se dikhne kaa jo dabaav ladkaa yaa ladki par banataa he, use duusari tarah se biimaar hi karata he
 You stop drinking food during its cycle
 tivi main jaisaa model dikhataa he vaisaa hi bananaa chaahate hai
 Looks like copying it
 ummid he aap darshak iske khatre ko samajhenge or mantri ji kaa bhi ye makasad nahin rahaa hoga
 The fitness of the minister is not new, so there is nothing to be impressed
 haa koi aisa ho jo 90 kilo se 60 kilo par aa jaae or yoga se lekar gym kaa prachaar kare to baat bhi bane
 But i have shown it with a special purpose
 agar soochna prasaaran mantri rajyavardhan rathod apane fitness main itnaa yakeen rakhte hai to unhen system ke bhi fitness par bhi dhyaan dena chahie
 The result of SSC CHSL 2015 examination came in August 2017
 hamaari naukari siries ke kaaran bahut se vibhaagon main kai hajaar chaatro ko niyukti patr mila
 During that time we also raised the case of 29 students of the film division
 ummid thi ki inhen niyukti patr mil jayega magar aaj tak nahin mila he
 Not only this, 12 youth are waiting for appointment letter in Directorate of Field Publicity
 agar mantri ji apane super fitness kaa istamaal karte hue in do vibhaagon kii khabar le len to 41 naujavaanon ke ghar main khushiyaan aa jaaengi
 The minister should also be fit and the ministry should also be fit
 tippaniyan The basic work of ministers is the first thing to be done
 ab aap dekhie 3287 noujvaan iskar vibhaag ke liye chune gaye hai
 Despite having a number of more than three thousand, they have been waiting for appointment letter for ten months
 ek to imtahaan dene main do do saal lag jate hai, doosraa paas hone ke baad agar das maheene kaa intazaar karnaa hoga to un par kya beetegi
 Can Piyush Goyal not take care of them? ye kaisaa bharat he jise feet banane ke liye mantri puddp kar rahe hai video banaakar twit kar rahe hai
 And the cheeks of the youth of the same India have become dry cucumber when the government will give the appointment letter
 is bich maharashtra ke parabhani main ek litre petrol 86 rupee 68 paise ho gaya he
 Many people are blaming the opposition for not raising the issue
 agar aap vipaksh ko itnaa hi miss kar rahe hai to ham aapako prakaash jaavdekar kaa ek purana bayaan dikhaate hai
 Which is going on well on social media
 yah bayaan unhone vipaksh main rahete hue diya tha
 What would have been better prakaash ji aaj bhi vipaksh main hote to wo acha hota yaa phir prakaash ji maanav sansaadhan kii jagah vitt mantri hote, wo acha hota
 How confident are the people saying that if the government wants, then Mumbai can get Rs 36 per liter of petrol, Delhi can get Rs 34 per liter
 tabhi aap log vipaksh ko miss kar rahe hai, sarkaar ko nahin
 At that time, Prakash ji compared excise duty to jizya tax
 kam se unhen is jajia kar ko samaapt karvaa dena chahie tha
 They should explain why the Jupia imposed by the UPA is running in the NDA
 ab aap yah na sochen ki aandhi-tufaan yaa kohre ke kaaran deree hone par bhi milegaa
 It is proposed in the charter that compensation will be given for delay due to the same reasons, for which airline companies will be responsible
 hawaii yatriyon kii takalif ho yaa unhen koi bhi suvidha milti ho turant hedline ban jaati he
 Perhaps it will also be related to their economic status and news channels will believe that air travelers have a time, which they also have the responsibility to protect
 yadi jahaaz teramake par ek ghante se zyada deree se khadaa rah gaya tab yatriyon ko company kii taraf se free main naashtaa pani milegaa
 There is no quarrel or jealousy of air travelers
 magar rail yatriyon ne sarkaar kaa kya bigaada he ki ve 38-38 ghante kii let se train main safar karte hai, unhen kuch nahin miltaa he
 There is a provision to return full fare after delay of 3 hours
 railway bataa de ki kitne yatri clem karte hai or railway ne kitna kiraaya waapas kiya he
 Recently, Bhagalpur Garib Rath reached Delhi 38 hours late from Patna
 iske yatriyon ko kitna muawza milanaa chahie
 There is not even a fantasy of more than 24 hours in the charter of air passengers, but rail passengers are suffering a delay of 50 50 hours
 kya inhen railway kii taraf se free main naashtaa pani or 10 hazaar nahin milanaa chahie
 When the government itself cannot provide this facility to its passengers, then why does it expect this from the airlines
 or jab vah vimaan companiyon ko dene ke liye baadhya kar sakati he to vah khud rail yatriyon ko kyon nahin detii he
 May 19 Anand vihar-bhagalpur Garibrath reached Bhagalpur with a delay of 29 hours 10 minutes
 22 may ke din chalane vaali yahi train cancil kar di gai, yatriyon kaa kaaphi nuksaan hua
 Due to our rail series, there has been a lot of improvement in the timing of Freedom Fighter Express, patna-kota Express
 50 se 60 ghante kii deree se chalane vaali patna-kota express 20 or 22 may ko patna se rhite time khuli he
 Travelers are not sure at times
 swatantraaa senaanee express jab kisi stesan par samay par pahunch jaati he to yatri is gaadi ko aise dekhte hai jaise koi sapana dekh rahe hon
 But the experience of these trains is terrible
 amritsar se darbhanga ke bich jananaayak express chalati he
 All general bogeys are
 ye train bhi khub deree se chalati he
 Tell whether the railway will provide free breakfast water to the laborers riding in it
 23 may ko amritsar se darbhanga vaali train 11 ghante se zyada kii deree se chal rahi he
 The train on 22 May reached Darbhanga on 22 May with a delay of 22 hours 30 minutes
 patna stesan par habib ne kuch yatriyon se is sawaal par unki pratikriya maangi to unhone bhi yahi kaha ki yatri to rail ke bhi hai, let hone par unhen bhi muawaaja mili
 Ravi Prajapati has emailed us a copy of his RTI attached
 is par 6 march 2018 kii taarikh likhi he
 In this, Ravi had asked how many times the train 12367 and 12368 anand-vihar Bhagalpur Vikramashila Express reached its destination on time in the 2017-18 calendar year, then the answer is that train number 22367 Vikramshila Express at anand-vihar Terminal 2017-18 i have reached on time only 6 times
 train number 12368 apni manzil bhagalupar sirf ek baar rhite time pahunchi he
 This train has been late for 32-32 hours
 sochie is train ke yatriyon ko muaavja mili to kitna acha rahegaa
 Every right should be a common slogan
 jo hawaii yatri ko mili vahi rail yatri ko mili
 The problem of getting late is more in Indian Railways
 patna ke ek anbhavi travel agent anil ne bataaya ki ek railgadee jiske ravaanaa hone kaa samay subah 10 baje kaa he
 Now its chart will be made four hours before the right time
 maan lijie train 20 ghante let ho gai
 You would like a train ticket canceled
 to aap subah 10 baje ke aadha ghanta pehle hi cancil kara sakate hai
 That is, half an hour before the original time
 uske baad cancel nahin kara sakate hai
 Even then you come to know that the train will not open at 10 o'clock in the morning and you want to cancel, then the money is received through the train depository Receipt TDR
 agent kehete hai ki bahut kam logon kaa paisa waapas aata he or wo bhi kabhi samay par nahin aata
 Arrives several months later
 railway is maamle main apni sthiti or spasht kar sakati he
 If that's the case then that's really sad
 train let bhi chale or cancil hone kaa vikalp bhi na rahe yah acchhee baat nahin he
 We boarded the Railradar at 3
46 pm on 23 May
 railyatri
 Checked in, then 70 percent of the trains were late and 30 percent were running at that time
 ye rose kaa haal he
 Now we want to show a video of Information and Broadcasting Minister Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore
 sena or khilaadi prishthbhumi se hone ke kaaran vah hameshaa feet hi dikhte rahe hai
 It's a good thing
 pehle aap video dekhie soochna prasaaran mantri se chaar saal pehle pradhanmantri narendra modi ne maai clin india hashtag naam se chalange diya tha
 He used to tag nine people on Twitter, further nine people would also tag any nine
 unhone isaki shuruyaat The day was 2 October 2014
 saal main 9 ko diya tha
 Sachin Tendulkar, Anil Ambani, Salman Khan, Priyanka Chopra, Kamal Haasan, Mridula Sinha, Ramdev, Tarak Mehta were challenged by the team of Chashma
 iske baad kai log dekha dekhi chalange karne lage
 Some of the pictures also became disputed, but at that time people took pictures of cleanliness and also tweeted
 bharat main isaki shuruyaat bhartiya rail main hui
 When someone used to leave it in the postcard saying that the goddess would have to be compelled to not reach so many people
 ye isi pattern par shuru hua tha
 Well, this challenge of the Prime Minister is cold now
 us samay jo log brands ambesader bane the, unamem se kai ab is maamle main kam hi sakriy honge
 Rathod sahib challenged Hrithik Roshan, Virat Kohli and Saina Nehwal to say that we are fit then India is fit
 ye teenon pehle hi feet hai magar rathod chaahate hai ki ye sabhi apane fitness ke video or pikchar karen or apane phans ko feet rahane kii chunauti den
 The story of his fitness continues to be published in magazines, in this interview, journalists keep asking the same, so the fan will know
 feet hona zaruri he
 The Indian government spent a lot on the promotion of yoga, yet Rajyavardhan Rathore has to give up the challenge of fitness leaving the original work of his ministry, the reason for this will be known
 behatar hota ki ve apane sahyogiyon ko ye chalange dete na ki jo pehle se feet hai unhen
 Many mps and ministers and i too are in dire need of fitness
 kuch mantri or saansad fitness kaa khyaal bhi rakhte hai
 But there is a criticism of this
 duniya bhar main isaki aalochana kii jaati he
 The pressure that is put on a boy or girl in a particular way of fitness, makes him ill in another way
 aap iske chakkar main khaanaa pinaa chhod dete hai
 Want to be what the model looks like in TV
 lagate he usee kii nakal karne
 Hopefully you viewers will understand its danger and the minister may not have had this motive
 mantri ji kaa fitness nayaa nahin he, isliye prabhavit hone kii baat nahin he
 Yes, there should be someone who comes from 90 kg to 60 kg and if we promote yoga from gym to talk, then the matter should be made
 magar maine ise ek khaas makasad se dikhaaya he
 If Information Broadcasting Minister Rajyavardhan Rathore believes so much in his fitness, he should also pay attention to the fitness of the system
 esayssi siechaesel 2015 kii pariksha kaa rigelt agsat 2017 main aa gaya tha
 Due to our job series, several thousand students got appointment letters in many departments
 us dauraan hamane film division ke 29 chaatro kaa maamla bhi uthaaya
 It was expected that he would get the appointment letter but has not received it till date
 yahi nahin diarectorat aaf field publicity main bhi 12 noujvaan niyukti patr kaa intazaar kar rahe hai
 If the minister uses his super fitness to take news of these two departments, then there will be happiness in the house of 41 youth
 mantri bhi feet rahen or mantralay bhi feet rahe ye naaraa hona chahie
 The comments mantriyon kaa mul kaam he wo sabase pehle hona chahie
 Now you see 3287 youth have been elected to Income Tax Department
 teen hazaar se zyada kii sankhya hone ke baad bhi ye das maheene se niyukti patr kaa intazaar kar rahe hai
 One, it takes two to two years to test, and if you have to wait for ten months after passing, then what will happen to them
 kya piyush goyal unki chintaa dur nahin kar sakate
 This is the kind of India that ministers are doing pushups to make fit and are tweeting videos
 or usee bharat ke naujavaanon ke gaal aant bahen sab suukh ke kakadi ho gai hai ki kab sarkaar niyukti patr degi
 Meanwhile, a liter of petrol in Parbhani in Maharashtra has increased to 86 rupees 68 paise
 kai log vipaksh ko dosha de rahe hai ki vah mudda nahin uthaa rahaa he
 If you miss the opposition this much, then we show you an old statement by Prakash Javadekar
 jo soshal media par khub chal rahaa he
 He made this statement while in opposition
 kya acha hota
 Even if Prakash ji were in opposition even today, it would have been good or Prakash ji would have been finance minister instead of human resource, it would have been good
 kitne aatmavishvaas se kah rahe hai ki sarkaar chaahe to mumbai main 36 rupee prati litre petrol mil saktaa he, dilli main 34 rupee prati litre mil saktaa he
 That is why you are missing the opposition, not the government
 us vakt prakaash ji ne excise duty kii tulana jajia kar se kii thi
 At least they should have abolished this jizya tax
 unhen bataanaa chahie ki upie ne jo jajia lagaaya tha wo endie main kyon chal rahaa he
 There is no quarrel or jealousy of air travelers
 magar rail yatriyon ne sarkaar kaa kya bigaada he ki ve 38-38 ghante kii let se train main safar karte hai, unhen kuch nahin miltaa he
 There is a provision to return full fare after delay of 3 hours
 railway bataa de ki kitne yatri clem karte hai or railway ne kitna kiraaya waapas kiya he

 Sachin Tendulkar, Anil Ambani, Salman Khan, Priyanka Chopra, Kamal Haasan, Mridula Sinha, Ramdev, Tarak Mehta were challenged by the team of Chashma
 iske baad kai log dekha dekhi chalange karne lage
 Some of the pictures also became disputed, but at that time people took pictures of cleanliness and also tweeted
 bharat main isaki shuruyaat bhartiya rail main hui
 When someone used to leave it in the postcard saying that the goddess would have to be compelled to not reach so many people
 ye isi pattern par shuru hua tha
 Well, this challenge of the Prime Minister is cold now
 us samay jo log brands ambesader bane the, unamem se kai ab is maamle main kam hi sakriy honge
 Rathod sahib challenged Hrithik Roshan, Virat Kohli and Saina Nehwal to say that we are fit then India is fit
 ye teenon pehle hi feet hai magar rathod chaahate hai ki ye sabhi apane fitness ke video or pikchar karen or apane phans ko feet rahane kii chunauti den
 The story of his fitness continues to be published in magazines, in this interview, journalists keep asking the same, so the fan will know
 feet hona zaruri he
 The Indian government spent a lot on the promotion of yoga, yet Rajyavardhan Rathore has to give up the challenge of fitness leaving the original work of his ministry, the reason for this will be known
 behatar hota ki ve apane sahyogiyon ko ye chalange dete na ki jo pehle se feet hai unhen
 Many mps and ministers and i too are in dire need of fitness
 kuch mantri or saansad fitness kaa khyaal bhi rakhte hai
 But there is a criticism of this
 duniya bhar main isaki aalochana kii jaati he
 The pressure that is put on a boy or girl in a particular way of fitness, makes him ill in another way
 aap iske chakkar main khaanaa pinaa chhod dete hai
 Want to be what the model looks like in TV
 lagate he usee kii nakal karne
 Hopefully you viewers will understand its danger and the minister may not have had this motive
 mantri ji kaa fitness nayaa nahin he, isliye prabhavit hone kii baat nahin he
 Yes, there should be someone who comes from 90 kg to 60 kg and if we promote yoga from gym to talk, then the matter should be made
 magar maine ise ek khaas makasad se dikhaaya he
 If Information Broadcasting Minister Rajyavardhan Rathore believes so much in his fitness, he should also pay attention to the fitness of the system
 esayssi siechaesel 2015 kii pariksha kaa rigelt agsat 2017 main aa gaya tha
 Due to our job series, several thousand students got appointment letters in many departments
 us dauraan hamane film division ke 29 chaatro kaa maamla bhi uthaaya
 It was expected that he would get the appointment letter but has not received it till date
 yahi nahin diarectorat aaf field publicity main bhi 12 noujvaan niyukti patr kaa intazaar kar rahe hai
 If the minister uses his super fitness to take news of these two departments, then there will be happiness in the house of 41 youth
 mantri bhi feet rahen or mantralay bhi feet rahe ye naaraa hona chahie
 The comments mantriyon kaa mul kaam he wo sabase pehle hona chahie
 Now you see 3287 youth have been elected to Income Tax Department
 teen hazaar se zyada kii sankhya hone ke baad bhi ye das maheene se niyukti patr kaa intazaar kar rahe hai
 One, it takes two to two years to test, and if you have to wait for ten months after passing, then what will happen to them
 kya piyush goyal unki chintaa dur nahin kar sakate
 This is the kind of India that ministers are doing pushups to make fit and are tweeting videos
 or usee bharat ke naujavaanon ke gaal aant bahen sab suukh ke kakadi ho gai hai ki kab sarkaar niyukti patr degi
 Meanwhile, a liter of petrol in Parbhani in Maharashtra has increased to 86 rupees 68 paise
 kai log vipaksh ko dosha de rahe hai ki vah mudda nahin uthaa rahaa he
 If you miss the opposition this much, then we show you an old statement by Prakash Javadekar
 jo soshal media par khub chal rahaa he
 He made this statement while in opposition
 kya acha hota
 Even if Prakash ji were in opposition even today, it would have been good or Prakash ji would have been finance minister instead of human resource, it would have been good
 kitne aatmavishvaas se kah rahe hai ki sarkaar chaahe to mumbai main 36 rupee prati litre petrol mil saktaa he, dilli main 34 rupee prati litre mil saktaa he
 That is why you are missing the opposition, not the government
 us vakt prakaash ji ne excise duty kii tulana jajia kar se kii thi
 At least they should have abolished this jizya tax
 unhen bataanaa chahie ki upie ne jo jajia lagaaya tha wo endie main kyon chal rahaa he
 May 19 Anand vihar-bhagalpur Garibrath reached Bhagalpur with a delay of 29 hours 10 minutes
 22 may ke din chalane vaali yahi train cancil kar di gai, yatriyon kaa kaaphi nuksaan hua
 Due to our rail series, there has been a lot of improvement in the timing of Freedom Fighter Express, patna-kota Express
 50 se 60 ghante kii deree se chalane vaali patna-kota express 20 or 22 may ko patna se rhite time khuli he
 Travelers are not sure at times
 swatantraaa senaanee express jab kisi stesan par samay par pahunch jaati he to yatri is gaadi ko aise dekhte hai jaise koi sapana dekh rahe hon
 But the experience of these trains is terrible
 amritsar se darbhanga ke bich jananaayak express chalati he
 All general bogeys are
 ye train bhi khub deree se chalati he
 Tell whether the railway will provide free breakfast water to the laborers riding in it
 23 may ko amritsar se darbhanga vaali train 11 ghante se zyada kii deree se chal rahi he
 The train on 22 May reached Darbhanga on 22 May with a delay of 22 hours 30 minutes
 patna stesan par habib ne kuch yatriyon se is sawaal par unki pratikriya maangi to unhone bhi yahi kaha ki yatri to rail ke bhi hai, let hone par unhen bhi muawaaja mili
 Ravi Prajapati has emailed us a copy of his RTI attached
 is par 6 march 2018 kii taarikh likhi he
 In this, Ravi had asked how many times the train 12367 and 12368 anand-vihar Bhagalpur Vikramashila Express reached its destination on time in the 2017-18 calendar year, then the answer is that train number 22367 Vikramshila Express at anand-vihar Terminal 2017-18 i have reached on time only 6 times
 train number 12368 apni manzil bhagalupar sirf ek baar rhite time pahunchi he
 This train has been late for 32-32 hours
 sochie is train ke yatriyon ko muaavja mili to kitna acha rahegaa
 Every right should be a common slogan
 jo hawaii yatri ko mili vahi rail yatri ko mili
 The problem of getting late is more in Indian Railways
 patna ke ek anbhavi travel agent anil ne bataaya ki ek railgadee jiske ravaanaa hone kaa samay subah 10 baje kaa he
 Now its chart will be made four hours before the right time
 maan lijie train 20 ghante let ho gai
 You would like a train ticket canceled
 to aap subah 10 baje ke aadha ghanta pehle hi cancil kara sakate hai
 That is, half an hour before the original time
 uske baad cancel nahin kara sakate hai
 Even then you come to know that the train will not open at 10 o'clock in the morning and you want to cancel, then the money is received through the train depository Receipt TDR
 agent kehete hai ki bahut kam logon kaa paisa waapas aata he or wo bhi kabhi samay par nahin aata
 Arrives several months later
 railway is maamle main apni sthiti or spasht kar sakati he
 If that's the case then that's really sad
 train let bhi chale or cancil hone kaa vikalp bhi na rahe yah acchhee baat nahin he
 We boarded the Railradar at 3
46 pm on 23 May
 railyatri
 Checked in, then 70 percent of the trains were late and 30 percent were running at that time
 ye rose kaa haal he
 Now we want to show a video of Information and Broadcasting Minister Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore
 sena or khilaadi prishthbhumi se hone ke kaaran vah hameshaa feet hi dikhte rahe hai
 It's a good thing
 pehle aap video dekhie soochna prasaaran mantri se chaar saal pehle pradhanmantri narendra modi ne maai clin india hashtag naam se chalange diya tha

 Jannayak Express runs between Amritsar to Darbhanga
 sari general bogi hoti he
 This train also runs very late
 bataaiye kya railway inamen savaar mazdooron ko free main naashtaa pani degi
 On May 23, the train from Amritsar to Darbhanga was running late by more than 11 hours
 22 may kii train 23 may ko 22 ghanta 30 minute kii deree se darbhanga pahunchi he
 At Patna station, Habib asked some passengers for their response to this question, then they also said that the passengers are also on the rail, they also get compensation when they are late
 ravi prajapati ne hamen email se apni lagaai hui ek artiai kii copy mail kii he
 The date of 6 March 2018 is written on it
 isamen ravi ne poocha tha ki 2017-18 ke calendar year main train 12367 or 12368 anand-vihaar bhagalpur vikramshila express kitni baar apni manzil par samay se pahunchi, to jawaab miltaa he ki train number 22367 vikramshila express anand-vihaar terminal par 2017-18 main maatr 6 baar samay par pahunchi he
 Train number 12368 has reached its destination Bhagalpur only once
 yah train 32-32 ghante tak let chali he
 Think how good it will be if the passengers of this train are compensated
 har adhikaar ek samaan kaa naaraa hona chahie
 The air passenger gets the same rail passenger
 let hone kii samasya bhartiya rail main zyada he
 Anil, an experienced travel agent from Patna, told that a train whose departure time is at 10 am
 ab iskaa chart rhite time ke chaar ghanta pehle ban jayega
 Suppose the train was late for 20 hours
 aap chahenge ki train kaa tikat cancel kara len
 So you can cancel half an hour before 10 am
 yani original time ke aadha ghanta pehle
 Cancellation cannot be done after that
 phir bhi aapako pataa chal jaataa he ki train subah 10 baje nahin khulegi or aap cancil karana chaahate hai to train dipalitary recipt tidiar ke jariye paisa waapas miltaa he
 Agents say that very few people get their money back and that too never comes on time
 kai maheene baad aata he
 Railways can further clarify their position in this matter
 agar aisa he to vaaki dukhad he
 It is not a good thing to train late and not have the option to be canceled
 hamane 23 may kii dopaher 3 bajkar 46 minute par Railradar

 This is a daily situation
 ab ham soochna or prasaaran mantri rajyavardhan singh rathod kaa ek video dikhaanaa chaahate hai
 Being from the army and sportsmen background, he has always looked fit
 yah acchhee baat he
 First you watch the video, four years before the Minister of Information Broadcasting, Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave a challenge named My Clean India hashtag
 ve twitor par nau logon ko tag karte the, aage ve nau log bhi kisi nau ko tag kar dete the
 They started it 2 aktubar 2014 ke din kii thi
 Gave 9 in the year
 sachin tendulkar, anil ambani, salmaan khan, priyanka chopra, camel hasan, mridula sinha, ramdev, tarak mehta kaa ulta chashma kii team ko chalange kiya tha
 After this, many people started doing challenges
 kuch tasviren vivaadit bhi ho gai magar us vakt logon ne saaf safai kii tasviren khinchaa kar twit bhi kar diya
 It started in India on the Indian Railways
 jab koi postcard main yah likhakar chhod jaataa tha ki itane logon ko nahin pahunchane par devi kaa kopbhaajan hona padegaa
 It started on this pattern
 khayr pradhanmantri kaa yah chalange ab thanda padaa chukaa he
 Many of those who had become brand ambassadors at that time would now be less active in this matter
 rathod sahab ruthik raushan, viraat kohli or cyna nehwal ko chalange diya ki ham feet to india feet
 All three are already fit, but Rathore wants them to do their fitness videos and pictures and challenge their fans to stay fit
 inke fitness kii kahani patrikaon main chhapati hi rahati he, inase intervyuu main patrkaar yahi sab poochhate rahete hai, isliye jo fain hoga unhen pataa bhi hoga
 It is important to be fit
 bharat sarkaar ne yoga ke prachaar prasar par kaaphi kharch kiya, phir bhi rajyavardhan rathod ko apane mantralay kaa mul kaam chhodkar fitness kaa chalange dena padaa he, isaki vajah vahi jaanate honge
 It would have been better if he had given this challenge to his colleagues and not to those who were already fit
 kai saansadon or mantriyon or mujhe bhi fitness kii sakht zarurat he
 Some ministers and mps also take care of fitness
 magar isaki ek aalochana he
 It is criticized worldwide
 fitness ko lekar ek khaas tarah se dikhne kaa jo dabaav ladkaa yaa ladki par banataa he, use duusari tarah se biimaar hi karata he
 You stop drinking food during its cycle
 tivi main jaisaa model dikhataa he vaisaa hi bananaa chaahate hai
 Looks like copying it
 ummid he aap darshak iske khatre ko samajhenge or mantri ji kaa bhi ye makasad nahin rahaa hoga
 The fitness of the minister is not new, so there is nothing to be impressed
 haa koi aisa ho jo 90 kilo se 60 kilo par aa jaae or yoga se lekar gym kaa prachaar kare to baat bhi bane
 But i have shown it with a special purpose
 agar soochna prasaaran mantri rajyavardhan rathod apane fitness main itnaa yakeen rakhte hai to unhen system ke bhi fitness par bhi dhyaan dena chahie
 The result of SSC CHSL 2015 examination came in August 2017
 hamaari naukari siries ke kaaran bahut se vibhaagon main kai hajaar chaatro ko niyukti patr mila
 During that time we also raised the case of 29 students of the film division
 ummid thi ki inhen niyukti patr mil jayega magar aaj tak nahin mila he
 Not only this, 12 youth are waiting for appointment letter in Directorate of Field Publicity
 agar mantri ji apane super fitness kaa istamaal karte hue in do vibhaagon kii khabar le len to 41 naujavaanon ke ghar main khushiyaan aa jaaengi
 The minister should also be fit and the ministry should also be fit

 Despite having a number of more than three thousand, they have been waiting for appointment letter for ten months
 ek to imtahaan dene main do do saal lag jate hai, doosraa paas hone ke baad agar das maheene kaa intazaar karnaa hoga to un par kya beetegi
 Can Piyush Goyal not take care of them? ye kaisaa bharat he jise feet banane ke liye mantri puddp kar rahe hai video banaakar twit kar rahe hai
 And the cheeks of the youth of the same India have become dry cucumber when the government will give the appointment letter
 is bich maharashtra ke parabhani main ek litre petrol 86 rupee 68 paise ho gaya he
 Many people are blaming the opposition for not raising the issue
 agar aap vipaksh ko itnaa hi miss kar rahe hai to ham aapako prakaash jaavdekar kaa ek purana bayaan dikhaate hai
 Which is going on well on social media
 yah bayaan unhone vipaksh main rahete hue diya tha
 What would have been better prakaash ji aaj bhi vipaksh main hote to wo acha hota yaa phir prakaash ji maanav sansaadhan kii jagah vitt mantri hote, wo acha hota
 How confident are the people saying that if the government wants, then Mumbai can get Rs 36 per liter of petrol, Delhi can get Rs 34 per liter
 tabhi aap log vipaksh ko miss kar rahe hai, sarkaar ko nahin
 At that time, Prakash ji compared excise duty to jizya tax
 kam se unhen is jajia kar ko samaapt karvaa dena chahie tha

 hamane 23 may kii dopaher 3 bajkar 46 minute par Railradar
 railyatri
 in par check kiya, to us vakt 70 pratishat railgadiyaan let thim or 30 fisadi samay se chal rahi thim
 This is a daily situation
 ab ham soochna or prasaaran mantri rajyavardhan singh rathod kaa ek video dikhaanaa chaahate hai
 Being from the army and sportsmen background, he has always looked fit
 yah acchhee baat he
 First you watch the video, four years before the Minister of Information Broadcasting, Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave a challenge named My Clean India hashtag
 ve twitor par nau logon ko tag karte the, aage ve nau log bhi kisi nau ko tag kar dete the
 They started it 2 aktubar 2014 ke din kii thi
 Gave 9 in the year
 sachin tendulkar, anil ambani, salmaan khan, priyanka chopra, camel hasan, mridula sinha, ramdev, tarak mehta kaa ulta chashma kii team ko chalange kiya tha
 After this, many people started doing challenges
 kuch tasviren vivaadit bhi ho gai magar us vakt logon ne saaf safai kii tasviren khinchaa kar twit bhi kar diya
 It started in India on the Indian Railways
 jab koi postcard main yah likhakar chhod jaataa tha ki itane logon ko nahin pahunchane par devi kaa kopbhaajan hona padegaa
 It started on this pattern
 khayr pradhanmantri kaa yah chalange ab thanda padaa chukaa he
 Many of those who had become brand ambassadors at that time would now be less active in this matter
 rathod sahab ruthik raushan, viraat kohli or cyna nehwal ko chalange diya ki ham feet to india feet
 All three are already fit, but Rathore wants them to do their fitness videos and pictures and challenge their fans to stay fit
 inke fitness kii kahani patrikaon main chhapati hi rahati he, inase intervyuu main patrkaar yahi sab poochhate rahete hai, isliye jo fain hoga unhen pataa bhi hoga
 It is important to be fit
 bharat sarkaar ne yoga ke prachaar prasar par kaaphi kharch kiya, phir bhi rajyavardhan rathod ko apane mantralay kaa mul kaam chhodkar fitness kaa chalange dena padaa he, isaki vajah vahi jaanate honge
 It would have been better if he had given this challenge to his colleagues and not to those who were already fit
 kai saansadon or mantriyon or mujhe bhi fitness kii sakht zarurat he
 Some ministers and mps also take care of fitness
 magar isaki ek aalochana he
 It is criticized worldwide
 fitness ko lekar ek khaas tarah se dikhne kaa jo dabaav ladkaa yaa ladki par banataa he, use duusari tarah se biimaar hi karata he
 You stop drinking food during its cycle
 tivi main jaisaa model dikhataa he vaisaa hi bananaa chaahate hai
 Looks like copying it
 ummid he aap darshak iske khatre ko samajhenge or mantri ji kaa bhi ye makasad nahin rahaa hoga
 The fitness of the minister is not new, so there is nothing to be impressed
 haa koi aisa ho jo 90 kilo se 60 kilo par aa jaae or yoga se lekar gym kaa prachaar kare to baat bhi bane
 But i have shown it with a special purpose
 agar soochna prasaaran mantri rajyavardhan rathod apane fitness main itnaa yakeen rakhte hai to unhen system ke bhi fitness par bhi dhyaan dena chahie
 The result of SSC CHSL 2015 examination came in August 2017
 hamaari naukari siries ke kaaran bahut se vibhaagon main kai hajaar chaatro ko niyukti patr mila
 During that time we also raised the case of 29 students of the film division
 ummid thi ki inhen niyukti patr mil jayega magar aaj tak nahin mila he
 Not only this, 12 youth are waiting for appointment letter in Directorate of Field Publicity
 agar mantri ji apane super fitness kaa istamaal karte hue in do vibhaagon kii khabar le len to 41 naujavaanon ke ghar main khushiyaan aa jaaengi
 The minister should also be fit and the ministry should also be fit
 tippaniyan The basic work of ministers is the first thing to be done
 ab aap dekhie 3287 noujvaan iskar vibhaag ke liye chune gaye hai
 Despite having a number of more than three thousand, they have been waiting for appointment letter for ten months
 ek to imtahaan dene main do do saal lag jate hai, doosraa paas hone ke baad agar das maheene kaa intazaar karnaa hoga to un par kya beetegi
 Can Piyush Goyal not take care of them? ye kaisaa bharat he jise feet banane ke liye mantri puddp kar rahe hai video banaakar twit kar rahe hai
 And the cheeks of the youth of the same India have become dry cucumber when the government will give the appointment letter
 is bich maharashtra ke parabhani main ek litre petrol 86 rupee 68 paise ho gaya he
 Many people are blaming the opposition for not raising the issue
 agar aap vipaksh ko itnaa hi miss kar rahe hai to ham aapako prakaash jaavdekar kaa ek purana bayaan dikhaate hai
 Which is going on well on social media
 yah bayaan unhone vipaksh main rahete hue diya tha
 What would have been better prakaash ji aaj bhi vipaksh main hote to wo acha hota yaa phir prakaash ji maanav sansaadhan kii jagah vitt mantri hote, wo acha hota
 How confident are the people saying that if the government wants, then Mumbai can get Rs 36 per liter of petrol, Delhi can get Rs 34 per liter
 tabhi aap log vipaksh ko miss kar rahe hai, sarkaar ko nahin
 At that time, Prakash ji compared excise duty to jizya tax
 kam se unhen is jajia kar ko samaapt karvaa dena chahie tha
 They should explain why the Jupia imposed by the UPA is running in the NDA
 agent kehete hai ki bahut kam logon kaa paisa waapas aata he or wo bhi kabhi samay par nahin aata
 Arrives several months later
 railway is maamle main apni sthiti or spasht kar sakati he
 If that's the case then that's really sad
 train let bhi chale or cancil hone kaa vikalp bhi na rahe yah acchhee baat nahin he
 We did Railradar on 23rd May every 3rd at 46 minutes
 railyatri
 Checked in, then 70 percent of the trains were late and 30 percent were running at that time
 ye rose kaa haal he
 Now we want to show a video of Information and Broadcasting Minister Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore
 sena or khilaadi prishthbhumi se hone ke kaaran vah hameshaa feet hi dikhte rahe hai
 It's a good thing
 pehle aap video dekhie soochna prasaaran mantri se chaar saal pehle pradhanmantri narendra modi ne maai clin india hashtag naam se chalange diya tha
 He used to tag nine people on Twitter, further nine people would also tag any nine
 unhone isaki shuruyaat The day was 2 October 2014
 saal main 9 ko diya tha
 Sachin Tendulkar, Anil Ambani, Salman Khan, Priyanka Chopra, Kamal Haasan, Mridula Sinha, Ramdev, Tarak Mehta were challenged by the team of Chashma
 iske baad kai log dekha dekhi chalange karne lage
 Some of the pictures also became disputed, but at that time people took pictures of cleanliness and also tweeted
 bharat main isaki shuruyaat bhartiya rail main hui
 When someone used to leave it in the postcard saying that the goddess would have to be compelled to not reach so many people
 ye isi pattern par shuru hua tha
 Well, this challenge of the Prime Minister is cold now
 us samay jo log brands ambesader bane the, unamem se kai ab is maamle main kam hi sakriy honge
 Rathod sahib challenged Hrithik Roshan, Virat Kohli and Saina Nehwal to say that we are fit then India is fit
 ye teenon pehle hi feet hai magar rathod chaahate hai ki ye sabhi apane fitness ke video or pikchar karen or apane phans ko feet rahane kii chunauti den
 The story of his fitness continues to be published in magazines, in this interview, journalists keep asking the same, so the fan will know
 feet hona zaruri he
 The Indian government spent a lot on the promotion of yoga, yet Rajyavardhan Rathore has to give up the challenge of fitness leaving the original work of his ministry, the reason for this will be known
 behatar hota ki ve apane sahyogiyon ko ye chalange dete na ki jo pehle se feet hai unhen
 Many mps and ministers and i too are in dire need of fitness
 kuch mantri or saansad fitness kaa khyaal bhi rakhte hai
 But there is a criticism of this
 duniya bhar main isaki aalochana kii jaati he
 The pressure that is put on a boy or girl in a particular way of fitness, makes him ill in another way
 aap iske chakkar main khaanaa pinaa chhod dete hai
 Want to be what the model looks like in TV
 lagate he usee kii nakal karne
 Hopefully you viewers will understand its danger and the minister may not have had this motive
 mantri ji kaa fitness nayaa nahin he, isliye prabhavit hone kii baat nahin he
 Yes, there should be someone who comes from 90 kg to 60 kg and if we promote yoga from gym to talk, then the matter should be made
 magar maine ise ek khaas makasad se dikhaaya he
 If Information Broadcasting Minister Rajyavardhan Rathore believes so much in his fitness, he should also pay attention to the fitness of the system
 esayssi siechaesel 2015 kii pariksha kaa rigelt agsat 2017 main aa gaya tha
 Due to our job series, several thousand students got appointment letters in many departments
 us dauraan hamane film division ke 29 chaatro kaa maamla bhi uthaaya
 It was expected that he would get the appointment letter but has not received it till date
 yahi nahin diarectorat aaf field publicity main bhi 12 noujvaan niyukti patr kaa intazaar kar rahe hai
 If the minister uses his super fitness to take news of these two departments, then there will be happiness in the house of 41 youth
 mantri bhi feet rahen or mantralay bhi feet rahe ye naaraa hona chahie
 The comments mantriyon kaa mul kaam he wo sabase pehle hona chahie
 Now you see 3287 youth have been elected to Income Tax Department
 teen hazaar se zyada kii sankhya hone ke baad bhi ye das maheene se niyukti patr kaa intazaar kar rahe hai
 One, it takes two to two years to test, and if you have to wait for ten months after passing, then what will happen to them
 kya piyush goyal unki chintaa dur nahin kar sakate
 This is the kind of India that ministers are doing pushups to make fit and are tweeting videos
 or usee bharat ke naujavaanon ke gaal aant bahen sab suukh ke kakadi ho gai hai ki kab sarkaar niyukti patr degi
 Meanwhile, a liter of petrol in Parbhani in Maharashtra has increased to 86 rupees 68 paise
 kai log vipaksh ko dosha de rahe hai ki vah mudda nahin uthaa rahaa he
 If you miss the opposition this much, then we show you an old statement by Prakash Javadekar
 jo soshal media par khub chal rahaa he
 He made this statement while in opposition
 kya acha hota
 Even if Prakash ji were in opposition even today, it would have been good or Prakash ji would have been finance minister instead of human resource, it would have been good
 kitne aatmavishvaas se kah rahe hai ki sarkaar chaahe to mumbai main 36 rupee prati litre petrol mil saktaa he, dilli main 34 rupee prati litre mil saktaa he
 That is why you are missing the opposition, not the government
 us vakt prakaash ji ne excise duty kii tulana jajia kar se kii thi
 At least they should have abolished this jizya tax
 unhen bataanaa chahie ki upie ne jo jajia lagaaya tha wo endie main kyon chal rahaa he
 Now we want to show a video of Information and Broadcasting Minister Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore
 sena or khilaadi prishthbhumi se hone ke kaaran vah hameshaa feet hi dikhte rahe hai

 kashmiri ne endisi ko aisa pratishthit bhartiya santhaan bataaya, jo sena ke aalaa adhikariyon, karnal or unche str ke adhikariyon ko prashikshan detaa he
 Pasha told Headley that "if we succeed in attacking the NDC, we can kill even more Indian brigadiers than Pakistan has killed in four wars with India
" ’ apane aakaaon se nirdesh paane ke baad hedli ne dilli, pushkar or goa ke chabad houseon ke alaava endisi kii bhi toh lee
 After this he went back to Pakistan, so that he could give the material, photographs and videos from this entire reconnaissance campaign to his masters

 isse uski pahunch, dhamak or abhiyaanon kii chapaltaa main to khayr koi badhotaree nahin hi hoti, ulate yah uski hawaii takat par ulataa asar daalati he
 As per the current plan, with the recruitment of 36 Rafale aircraft purchased in ready condition by 2025, the Air Force has "30 Suki mkis or 17-20 squads, more than 90 between 272 to 312 upgraded with" Super Sukhoi "features
 There will be Jaguars or five squads, more than 60 mig-29s or four squads and more than 50 Mirage-2000s or three squads

 These are all medium multi-role combat aircraft (MMRCA), which, at most, can only be waged against Pakistan and the warring frontiers against China, given their distance constraints, but their strategic reach and importance is zero
 
 lihaaja china ke khilaaf doordaraj tak parmaanu hamale ke liye esayu-30 / rafel kii jo baat kahi ja rahi he, vah majaak he
 It envisions the Air Force as a strategic ally in the territory of the best air forces outside its territory (the Royal Air Force in the colonial period and the immediate aftermath of the 1962 war, and perhaps even the future, the US Air Force)
 - Consideration and conduct are appropriate
 vajah jo ho, par sena kaa jor puri tarah kam duuri se madhyam duuri ke vimaan hasil karne par he or tiu-22 ‘‘baikaphireʼʼ (jinaki pehali peshkash 1971 main kii gai thi) or usase bhi zyada ghaatak tiu-160 ‘‘blackjaikʼʼ hasil karne main uski jaraa dilchaspee nahin, jabaki in donon main se koi bhi ladaaku vimaan bahut pehle rus se kharida yaa lij par liya ja saktaa tha

 The worse thing is that with so little Rafale and such high investment, the Air Force will refrain from putting them in the battle because losing a single Rafale would mean Rs 1,600 crore

 Every leader who has been following Jawaharlal Nehru in the neat corner office of Prime Minister's Cell in South Block of New Delhi has been seen copying him
 yahaan tak ki narendra modi bhi, haalanki ve khuleam ise shaayad hi sweekaar karen
 Due to his education in the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Modi was seen spewing venom against the country's first Prime Minister and rejecting his achievements
 haalanki indira gandhi se zyada, nehru ko hi aadhunik bharat kaa nirmaataa mana jaataa he or unke baad aayaa har pradhanmantri, modi sahit, unheen jaisaa sammaan hasil karne kii hasarat rakhata aayaa he
 For example, search only by entering the words 'nehru' and 'books' on Google
 unki likhi kareeb 50 kitabon or unke bhaashanon ke sankalan ke alaava aisi kareeb hajaar kitabon kii fehrist nikal aegi, jo unke or unki viraasat ke bare main likhi gai hai
 This is a thick picture of Nehru's importance in the Indian public
 modi agle maheene bataur pradhanmantri apane paanch saal puure kar rahe hai or duusare kaarykaal ke liye janadesh maang rahe hai, unki nazren saaf taur par nehru jaisi buland viraasat sthapit karne yani duusare ganatantr kaa nirmaataa kahalaane par tiki hai
 While issuing the bjp's resolution letter for the 2019 general election, Modi did not restrict himself to what his government and the party would do by 2024, but rather he set a surprise by 2047, when Hindustan would give a hundred Will complete the year unhone aise bharat kaa vijan pesh kiya, jo viksit desh hone ke saath duniya kii ek mahashakti banegaa
 After saying that Modi referred to the work done by his government so far and said that if he is elected again for the next five years, then it will become a means to achieve the great goal (by the way, if Modi retires at the age of 75 years) If they uphold the principles of their party, they will have to settle in 2025 and then they can break the record of Nehru and Indira Gandhi for the longest time to hold the post of Prime Minister Finance will be out of Prime Numbers)

 Their method is militaristic and if they lose their trust from the Prime Minister, then they become very ruthless and harsh
 yahi vajah he ki nae bharat kii neenv rakhane ke liye nehru kii jai-jayakaar kii jaati he, to 1962 kii jang main china ke haathon apmanjanak paraajay ke liye unhen kosa bhi jaataa he
 Indira Gandhi is praised for making India a nuclear power in 1974 and for splitting Pakistan in the 1971 war, but is equally remembered for imposing Emergency between 1975 and 1977
 rajeev gandhi ko aisa pradhanmantri mana jaataa he, jinhone hindustan main computer kranti kaa sutarapaat kiya or vikaas kaa mishan taiyaar kiya, magar boforce ghotaale or hindustan ko srilanka kii jang main uljhane kii vajah se ve kadavi yaaden bhi jagaate hai

 Finally, in his first term, Manmohan Singh gained appreciation for his record of economic prosperity and the nuclear deal with the US, while in his second term he lost a lot of goodwill due to allegations of scams and policy paralysis
