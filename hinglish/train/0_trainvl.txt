 centre sarkaar ne banking sector main kaaphi bada kadam uthaate hue kai bade bainkon ke marjar kaa elaan kiya he
 Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman met the media on Friday and made big announcements in the banking sector
 saal 2017 main public sector ke 27 bank the, jinaki sankhya ab ghatakar 12 rah jaaegi
 This is an ambitious plan during the first term of the Modi government
 saarvajanik bainkon ke vilay ko lekar kai tarah kii ashankaayen rahati hai, haalanki abhi tak ke anubhavon se inkaa desh ko phayda hi miltaa dikh rahaa he
 SBI was started First of all, its associate banks and Mahila Bank were merged with SBI and then Bank of Baroda, Vijaya Bank and Dena Bank were merged
 vilay ke baad esbiai duniya ke 50 sabase bade bainkon kii suchi main shaamil ho gaya tha
 The government says that the new bank's customer base, formed after the merger, will increase market access and efficiency in operations
 iske alaava graahakon ko acchhee sevaayen milengi
 The government says that big banks benefit greatly from the economy and can easily cut costs to increase their efficiency
 vitt mantri nirmala sitaraman ne kaha ki isse customer kii rich badhane vaali he
 Bank capacity will increase, investment will be faster and there will be no inconvenience to the customers
 iconomi or banking ke liye phydemandbainkon kaa vishaal hona na sirf arthvyavastha ke liye phydemand he, balki isse unke vyavsaayik laagat main bhi kami aati he
 Former Finance Minister Arun Jaitley also said that this would strengthen banks and increase their lending capacity
 vilay ke kaarnon ko bataate hue unhone kaha tha ki bainkon kii karj dene kii sthiti kamjor hone se companiyon kaa nivesh prabhavit ho rahaa he
 Public sector banks account for nearly 90 percent of the total non-performing assets (npas) of the banking sector to counter the NPA crisis
 baking sector main pichley vitt varsh main kareeb 8 lakh karod rupee kaa enpie tha, jo vitt mantri nirmala sitaraman ke anusaar ab 7
 90 lakh crores is left
 NPA sankat ko dekhte hue kamjor bainkon ke vilay kaa matlab yah bhi he ki bainkon kii taadaad kam hogi, lekin ve puunjigat aadhaar par behatar honge or unki nigaraanee main aasaani hogi
 Larger banks have more capital
 sarkaar or niamakon ke liye inaki sahaayta karnaa aasaan hota he
 The government can easily help them in crisis and save them from drowning
 iske alaava bade bank nakadi kaa behatar prabandhan bhi kar sakate hai
 The merger of banks greatly increases their combined business
 isse unka enpie kul milakar sanbhaalane laayak ho jaataa he
 They have low cost deposits and increased buffer capital
 graahakon par khaas vipareet asar nahinjankaron kaa maananaa he ki kamjor bainkon kaa agar majboot bainkon main vilay hota he to graahakon ke liye phaayde kaa sauda hota he
 Strong banks can offer more attractive interest on deposits in the long term for account holders and can also reduce loan rates
 vilay prakriya main kam se kam 4 se 6 maheene kaa vakt lag saktaa he
 The branches of the respective banks will get a new name and their IFSC codes will also be changed
 haalanki, in bainkon ke graahakon par koi asar nahin padegaa kyonki yah prakriya charanbaddh tareeke se chalegi
 Explain that the merger process of its associates banks in SBI was completed in a long time and despite this the customer service was not affected
 vitt mantri ne kaha he ki graahakon ko kisi bhi tarah kii asuvidha na ho iskaa puraa dhyaan rakhaa jayega, unke paas kaaphi branch honge
 May be cheaper, loan writers believe that in the short term, even if the rate of banks 'account holders' existing investment plans or most loan schemes does not matter, new and large banks can offer good interest rate on deposits in the long term
 Are, because the new bank will have more assets, lower NPA and business will grow
 bank home lone, auto lone jaisi karj kii daron ko gata sakate hai
 As soon as the announcement of the possibility of unemployment increases, it has often been seen that employees go on protest
 karmchaaree unionon kaa kahana he ki bainkon kaa enpie bad rahaa he, aise main bainkon kaa vilay karne se desh main berojgaare badhegi
 When the merger of the three banks was announced earlier, the bank unions opposed it
 unka daawa he ki state bank of india (SBI) main uske 5 sahyogi bainkon ke vilay se koi chamatkaar nahin hua tha
 During that time many branches had to be closed
 enpie bad gaya tha or karmchaariyon kii chantni bhi hui thi
 At the same time, the business of State Bank was also reduced
 200 saal main pehali baar esbiai nuksaan main aa gaya tha
 Loss to Better Bank Employees! Employee leaders believe that better financial conditions, due to large network, employees get many facilities which can be closed after the merger

 monster india ke ek survey main pataa chalaa ki ek jaisi padhai or anubhav ke baavjood workaplace par mahilaon ke saath bhedbhaav hota he
 The survey revealed that the salary of most women is 19% less than male colleagues
 is survey main 60 fisadi varking auraton kaa maananaa tha ki unke saath workaplace par bhedbhaav kiya jaataa he
 How much less the salary of women than men? Difference in industry-salary IT - 26% Manufacturing - 24% Healthcare, Social Work - 21% Financial Services, Banking - 2% One third of women surveyed said that they are very good for top management role Hardly conceded
 86 fisadi mahilaon kaa kahana tha ki sefti factor naukari chunate samay kaaphi myne rakhata he
 Half the women in the survey said that they did not want to work night shifts
 mahilaayein sabase zyada bhedbhaav shaadi ke baad daftar main anubhav karti hai
 47 per cent of the women said that they are believed to have got married, which means they are no longer serious about work
 46 fisadi ne kaha ki matternity ke baad mana jaataa he ki wo naukari chhod dengi
 Not only this, 47 percent of the women said that a perception about them is also made that they cannot give equal hours to men in the office
 survey main ek tihaai mahilaon ne kaha ki top management gender equality kii baat to karata he par ye kaaryastylee main nahin jhalkata
 a third of the women surveyed believed that the mandatory crèche facility in offices after the maternity bill would help women stay in the workforce

 Masood, who is an important Muslim leader of Western UP, came at a time when the Congress Party was preparing to capitalize on the resentment of Muslims against SP after the Muzaffarnagar riots due to this effective Muslim leader of Western UP

 The summer havoc is steadily increasing with each waning day
 garmiyon main logon ko sehat ke saath kai skin sambandhit samasyaayein bhi sataane lagati hai
 At the same time, people quickly dehydrate
 lekin aap apane dressing style main kuch badlaav kar ke garmi main hone vaali kai samasyaon se batch sakate hai
 Let's know what kind of clothes to wear during the summer season
 1
 Wear cotton clothes - Many people sweat excessively during the summer season
 is samasya se bachane ke liye garmiyon ke mausam main coton ke kapade pahanane chahie
 It absorbs sweat and dries it quickly and also reduces the growth of bacteria from the body
 coton ke kapade pahanane se sharir ko thandak kaa ehsaas hota he saath hi ye infections ko bhi control karata he
 So it would not be wrong to say that cotton is the best fabric for summer
 2
 Avoid wearing synthetic fabric - Avoid wearing synthetic fabric in the summer season, because the synthetic fabric does not have air in it, so it does not dry out when sweating and the smell of sweat starts from the body due to the growth of bacteria
 3
 Wear light colored clothes - In the summer season, wear light colored clothes like- white, light yellow, green, sky colors
 halke rang ke kapade garmiyon main thandak kaa ehsaas karaate hai, kyonki ye suraj kii garmi ko ebjorb nahin karte hai
 Whereas darker clothes absorb heat as much as possible and make you feel warm
 4
 Wear loose clothes - Avoid wearing tight clothes as much as possible during the summer season, as this worsens blood circulation
 aisa hone par sehat sambandhi kai samasyaayein hone lagati hai
 So choose the right clothes in the summer season

 unhone kaha ki is hinsa ke bare main grih mantri amit shah ko jaankaree di jaaegi
 Police have so far confirmed the deaths of two BJP and one TMC worker
 bijepi kaa jhanda hataane ko lekar donon guton main jhadap shuru ho gai, jo khooni hinsa main tabdeel ho gai
 After the accident, North Central Railway has issued helpline numbers - Allahabad: 0532-1072, 0532-2408149, 0532-2408128; Mirzapur: 05442-1072, 05442-220095, 05442-220096; Chunar: 05443-1072, 05443-222487, 05443-222137 duniya main ammonia gas ke utpaadan main bharat duusare sthaan paalmonia gas ke sampark main aane par apane chahare ko pani se dhoenodisha ke balasore main ek factory mechamonia gas likehone se 90 karmchaaree biimaar pad gaye hai
 Sick employees have been admitted to a hospital in Balasore
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki biimaar karmchaariyon main zyaadaatar mahila karmchaaree hai
 There have been many such cases of leaking ammonia gas
 jaaniye ammonia gas kitni khatarnaak hoti he or agar aap iske sampark main aa jaane to kya karen
 Ammonia gas is used extensively in milk plants
 mana jaataa he ki ammonia gas plant main risaav kaaphi khatarnaak sabit ho saktaa he
 Objections are raised about its uses in many departments
 yahi nahin sambandhit vibhaagon ko gyaapan bhejkar plant main ammonia ke sthaan par koi duusari gas kaa istemaal karaane kii maang bhi kii gai
 Used in ice-making factory Ammonia is used as a coolant in ice-making factory
 prayogshaala main pratikaarak ke rup main iskaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 Not only this, liquor ammonia is used to remove oil grease stains from clothes
 ammonium carbonate banane main iskaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 This is the reason why it is widely produced all over the world due to its excessive use
 It is a dangerous and poisonous gas
 Ammonia Ammonia is a colorless gas with a pungent odor
 yah hawa se halki hoti he
 Chemical fertilizers like urea, ammonium sulfate, ammonium phosphate, ammonium nitrate etc
 are used to make it
 ammonia ke jaleey ghol ko likar ammonia kaha jaataa he
 China is ranked number one in the production of ammonia while India is ranked number two
 ammonia gas se hanimana jaataa he thodi si bhi zyada maatra main ammonia soonghney par jaan ja sakati he
 Exposure to high concentrations of ammonia in the air causes nasal, throat, and respiratory tract burns
 yahi nahin kendrit ammonia samaadhaan jaise audyogic clinar ke saath sampark twachaa kii jalan, sthaayee aankh kshati yaa andhaapan sahit sanksharak chot kaa kaaran ban saktaa he
 It has been found in a research that a sudden tear in the eye results in sniffing
 adhik maatra se ghutan utpann hoti he or mrityu bhi ho jaati he
 What to do when exposed to ammonia? If ammonia leaks from an industry or ammonia tank, if the ammonia suddenly spreads in the environment, then the eyes and face should be washed with enough water
 ammonia jal main ati viley he isliye chehre ko jal se dhone se yah ghulkar alag ho jaati he
 Edward Snowden, a former contractor and whistleblower of the US intelligence agency National Security Agency, has created his account on Twitter
 gauratlab he ki snowden ne america sarkaar dwaara apane hi nagarikon kii jasusi kiye jane kaa pardaafash kiya tha
 He has since been out of the US
 enese se zyada hue foloversunke twitor acount banane ke ek ghante ke andar lagbhag 2 lakh logon ne unhen follow kiya
 Currently number 8
 50 lakh kaa aankada paar kar chuki he or yah enese ke twitor handle ko follow karne waalon se zyada he
 Snowden has only followed the National Security Agency and the interesting thing is that he has only followed the nsa's Twitter account
 unhone twitor par aate hi pehla twit ‘can you hear me now’ kiya
 Thousands of people congratulated him on Twitter
 philhal is twit ko lagbhag ek lakh logon ne retweet kiyaahai
 He has written about himself on his Twitter account that 'earlier i used to work for the US government but now i do it for the people
 'dekhen snowden kaa pehla twitan you hear me now?— Edward Snowden (@snowden)september 29, 2015 For a variety of reasons ranging from resources to editorial choice to local but national channels running from Delhi, South India and Northeast India would come to the world only when there is something that is less of a language, more of a hullabaloo or a slapstick
 Ho
 aaj ke media jagat main tamaasha kii koi bhashaa nahin hoti he
 If there is a spectacle, the incident of France on Hindi channels will also take more space than the important news of India
 sisitivi se record kiye gaye china kii koi sadak durghatana channelon kii duniya main local sanskaran kii khabaron kii tarah chaa jaati hai
 This has been happening, it will continue to happen
 na aap badalenge na channel
 Why should we change when no one changes
 haal hi main jab jayalalita kii haalat gambhir hui to chennai kii sadakon par tamaasha hua
 Police came rote bilakhte samarthak aae, kisi thikaane par vidhayak dal kii baithak hone lagi to aspataal ke bheetar kii tamaam khabaren kisi rahasy kii tarah channelon par chaane lageen
 Chennai generally dominated the Hindi channels, which remained away from the daily hassles of South India
 chennai kii sadakon par jamaa log, police kaa tanaav or antim sanskaar ke liye samandar ke kinare umadi lakhon kii bheed
 In severe and tragic scenes, like the spectacle, they were jammed into the world of the viewers of North India
 kyonki iske liye bhashaa kii zarurat nahin thi
 You were sitting at home just watching the uproar and becoming aware of the politics of South India without going deep into it
 agar inhen sab lamhon main tamaasha na hota to shaayad hi hindi channel yaa dilli se chalane vaale kisi bhi bhashaa ke global channel isaki parvaah karte ki dakshin main kya hua he
 The story ahead of Chennai will rarely come
 haa agar kaveri jal samjhaute ko lekar tamaasha ho jaae, saikadon basen jal jaaen, log aatmadah kar len to phir se tamilnadu tivi par chaa saktaa he
 There is no fault of you audience in this
 dosha tivi kaa bhi nahin he
 Nor of journalism
 dosha shaayad us tamaashe kaa he jisaki koi bhashaa nahin hoti he
 The pageant is the element that converts the channels running from Delhi to Chennai and the channels running from Chennai to Imphal
 isliye kai baar aapako apni bhashaa chhodkar tamaasha karnaa padataa he
 But every time a spectacle is not a spectacle
 wo aapke bheetar kii chitkaar hota he
 There is helplessness, restlessness, helplessness
 maan lijie aap hindi bhashi hai
 Live in Chennai or live in Kerala
 do chaar hazaar kii sankhya he
 There is no language other than Hindi
 magar aap sarkaar kii kisi niti se naaraaz hai
 Obviously you will raise your voice
 poster binar lekar marina bich par aa jaaenge taaki vahaan se guzarate mantriyon kaa kafila aapako dekh len
 May be those ministers do not know Hindi
 aas paas se guzarate logon ko hindi nahin aati ho
 The slogans of your poster and our demands written on it, become useless
 aapako lagata he ki kaash koi pard le
 Understand what we are doing
 aisi sthiti main yakeenan aap tadap uthenge, kisi aise kii talash karenge ki koi to bas se utrega or hamaari bhashaa padhakar sarkaar yaa press ko ittala kar degaa ki ham kya kah rahe hai
 When nothing happens, you will do something else that will make people see why 100-200 people are performing
 aap apane hi mulk main akelaa mahasoos karenge
 Will scream, scream
 ant main tarah tarah kaa tamaasha karne lagenge
 Will do things kapade utaarenge
 Will walk on fire
 geet gaayenge
 You will take yourself across the language
 kai baar purvottar ke chaatr jab jantar mantar pahunchate hai to jis andaaz main wo patrakaron ko phone karte hai, usase unki tadap kaa andaaza hota he
 They call everyone
 hindi nahin aati magar angrezi main bolte hai
 Then speak broken Hindi
 koi to pahonchega, unki baat media ke zariye desh or sarkaar ke saamne laaegaa
 Whenever such a call comes, the voicelessness on the other side scares
 aapako meri baat baari bharkam lagati ho to ise or aasaan kar detaa hum
 Look at the people sitting in queues at Jantar Mantar in Delhi
 inke paas dilli kii media ke liye bhashaa nahin he
 That is why they have given their bodies as language
 inkaa sharir, inke kapade bol rahe hai
 We have all seen the farmers around Delhi at this Jantar Mantar, but have not seen the farmers of Tamil Nadu
 inhen hindi nahin aati he
 Some are speaking English but they are also barely
 lihaaza inhone apane kapade utaar diye hai
 The women are just in green petticoats
 mard hare rang kii lungi main
 We asked the question why green
 jawaab mila haraa rang isliye kyonki ye kisaanon kaa rang he
 Is the color of the earth
 uttar bharat kii raajnneeti kesaria ko hindu or hare ko muslim samajhane main lagi he, magar dakshin ke kisaan hare ko kisaan kaa rang bataa rahe hai
 This farmer is not out of religion
 sabake badan par tripund bana he
 Shiva's devotees fall in love
 kuch kisaanon ne haath main katoraa liya he
 It is written in English that Beggar means beggar
 angreji main likhaa he taaki dilli samaj sake
 As a beggar, he wants to convey his words in English to you
 inke binar tamil main bhi nahin hai
 Are in English
 kuch kisaanon ne gale main narmund kii maala daal lee
 It is the symbol of those farmers who have committed suicide by being fed up with debt and farming crisis
 100 kii sankhya main aae ye kisaan tamil main naare laga rahe hai
 Hardly its voice reached the farmers around Delhi
 bharat main kisaan kisaan ke liye nahin bolta he
 The city does not speak for the farmer
 naaron kii bhashaa badal bhi jaati to bhi inhen sunne vaale log nahin badalte
 Our colleague Munne Bharti tried hard to talk to someone
 na munne angrezi bol sakate the na wo hindi
 There was a middle language left on both sides, English which we sometimes tease in the name of fake linguistic self-respect
 kisne sochaa tha ki karz se laden kisaanon ko, aatmahatya karne waalon kisaanon ko angrezi kaa sahaara lenaa padegaa
 Marathi, Punjabi, Tamil have all left the farmers
 dilli kii angrezi kii apni alag dehshat he
 The English town of Delhi scares the English
 munne bharti ne ek kisaan se baat kii
 Do not listen to what they are saying
 kis tarah se bol rahe hai, unke bolne main jo tuutan he, use dekhiye
 If you find this topic heavy, then see something else
 dilli main kaaphi sankhya main taminladu ke log rahete hai
 Sometimes came as an officer and started living in RK Puram in South Delhi
 vahaan se ritair hue to mayur vihaar kii taraf jaakar bas gaye
 Many more are inhabited
 in logon ne bataaya ki tamilnadu ke log aakar khaane pine kaa intazaam kar de rahe hai
 Are showing support ye bhi acha he ki das paanch hi sahi, is shahar ke log inke bich ja rahe hai
 This is our quality jaisaa ki maine kaha ki tivi main dakshin bharat unheen maukon par hota he jab tamaasha hota he
 Otherwise, where in the Hindi world are we concerned about Tamil Nadu, that in the last four months, four hundred farmers have committed suicide
 dilli main baithne vaale manvidhakaar ayog ne 5 janvari ko rajya sarkaar ko vahaan kii press report ke aadhaar par notice bheja he
 The Tamil daily reported on 3 January 2017 that 83 farmers had died due to heart attack
 usee akhbaar ne 5 janvari 2017 ko bataaya he ki ek maheene main kisaanon kii maut kaa aankada 106 par pahunch gaya he
 The Commission wrote that policy makers are ignoring farmers
 kisaanon ko kheti ke sankat se nikaalane kii zarurat he
 At the same time, the Madras High Court had also asked the Tamil Nadu government to file an affidavit within four weeks that the government should tell what it was going to do to stop the farmers' suicide
 media report ke anusaar tamilnadu main bhayankar sookhaa he
 We are not even hot for North Indians, but there is a drought in our beloved state of South
 rajya sarkaar ne sookhaa se nipatane ke liye 39,565 karod kii madad maangi
 You consider it a package
 tamilnadu main sookhaa ghoshit kar diya gaya he
 The rainfall in the Northeast has come down by 62 percent this year
 1876 ke baad pehali baar itani kam barish hui he
 For the first time in 100 years, such a crisis has come, yet one has to stand bare body at Jantar Mantar to bring the story of this drought to you
 mettoor baandh kaa pani bahut kam ho gaya he, kisaan na zamin kii taraf dekh saktaa he na aasmaan kii taraf taak saktaa he
 The farmers who have come to Jantar Mantar do not have much fields
 chote kisaan hi hai saare
 They have some demands
 ye kisaan 100 dinon ke liye bhukh hadtaal kar rahe hai
 They have a pamphlet in Hindi on which it is written at the top, 'farmers, who give food to the nation, to stop their suicide
 tamilnadu ko registan banane se rokna
 To prevent the Cauvery River from drying up
 kaveri nadi ke liye prabandhan samiti kaa gathan
 Determination of fair profitable prices for agricultural products
 ' It is also written in the pamphlet, hunger strike with sorrow
 sanghathan kaa naam he dakshin bhartiya nadiya kisaan sangh
 This name is also new to us
 nadiya kisaan sangh
 These people demand to connect the rivers
 subah jantar mantar par in andolankariyon ke liye koi samarthan jataane aayaa tha
 They have put their problem in front of us in Hindi
 itane dinon se kisaanon ke masale ko dekhte hue ek baat samaj ai he
 The farmers of India are not helpless
 bharat ke kisaan raajnneetik faisla karnaa jaanate hai
 They do not make political decisions according to their crises, but for the whole society
 varna kai rajyon main kisaan kisi raajnneetik dal ke liye vot hi nahin karte
 These farmers of Tamil Nadu are stuck with their belongings at Jantar Mantar itself
 jantar mantar hi asli rajdhani he
 The only representative site of India's problems
 sarkaron ne janata par jo jantar mantar kiya he, usase mukti kaa sthal jantar mantar hi ho saktaa he
 Democracy in India is alive as long as Jantar Mantar is alive
 tabhi to ye kisaan nange badan khuli sadak par let gaya he
 Farmers also get sleep
 teen chaar dinon se aise ram gaye hai jaise jantar mantar hi inkaa ghar ho
 This place is the farm for them
 kisaanon kii aatmahatya, sookhe kaa sankat ham sab cover karte hai
 There is nothing that the government does not know about, the journalist has not written
 kisaanon ko daam nahin mil rahe hai
 Sometimes compensation is received
 kabhi kabhaar karza maaf ho jaataa he
 But the crisis and drought returns every year or every other year
 maharashtra main barish se sookhe ne mukti pai to tamilnadu ko yah rog lag gaya
 Whenever someone commits suicide, it is added to the previous suicide
 106 kisaanon ne aatmahatya kii
 This farmer was 107th
 isliye kisaanon kii takaleef ab bhashaa ke paar he
 Those who have great faith in the language should read Basharat Masood's report printed on the front page of Friday's Indian Express
 kashmir ke kupwada kii kaniza ko to bhashaa ne uf karne tak kaa mauka nahin diya
 'sleeping in mother's arms
 bagal main uskaa bhai so rahaa tha
 a bullet arrived which silenced Kaniza
 maa ne jab apana haath beti kii taraf badhaayaa to kuch chipchipa sa mahasoos hua
 If i looked closely, the blood was spread on the bed
 kaniza is duniya se ja chuki thi
 Bullet was going on outside
 kaniza ke ghar ke paas main aatankwaadi chhipe the jinhen suraksha balon ne gher liya tha
 Whose gun shot was not known
 magar ek duusare ghar main so rahi kaniza ko maar gai
 His brother Faizal was also sleeping there
 ghayal ho gaya
 The policemen helped and Astpal was taken
 faisal kii jaan batch gai he magar aspataal main hone ke kaaran kaniza ko aakiri baar ke liye bhi nahin dekh paaya
 The problem of Kashmir is also like the problem of farmers
 sabko sankat maaloom he
 The solution is none
 ab unki takalif bhashaa ke paar ho chuki he
 There is no language of our insensitivity
 ham us goli kii tarah ho gaye hai jo ek baarah saal kii bacchee ko chupchaap maar kar, uske bistar ko lahooluhaan kar gaayab ho jate hai
 If there is any language for the suffering of Kaniza's mother, then tell it
 us bhashaa se puuchhiye ki neend main so rahi kaniza ne tab kya kaha tha, jab goli lagi thi
 His mother was sleeping there
 vahiin to uskaa bhai so rahaa tha
 The comments 'bahut pyaar karti thi kaniza ko
 i have four sons meri iklauti beti thi
 Sleeping with my head on my right hand
 achaakan usne jatke se saans lee
 When i put my hand on his body, it felt a bit sticky
 jab maine apni haathon ko dekha to koon se laal ho gaye the
 When i threw the blanket, i saw that there was blood all around
 uske or faijal ke badan se koon bah rahaa tha
 This is the statement of Kaniza's mother who told Basharat Masood of the Indian Express how his only and very dear daughter Kaniza was killed
 enditivi ke nazir masudi bhi kaniza ke ghar pahunche
 How difficult it would be for a reporter to communicate with people in such times
 andhera sa cameraa he
 Kaniza's brother is Kafzada
 bahan achaanak kahaan chali gai he ye unki samaj se baahar he
 13-year-old Aslam and 10-year-old Zafar all have eyes but their sister is not
 ghar dur tha magar goliyaan duuri tay kar leti hai
 This is the second incident within a week
 pulavama main bhi encounter kii goliyon kaa shikaar ek baccha ho gaya
 Was 15 years old, killed
 5 march ko sopor main suraksha balon ke camp ke nazadik visphot hone se chaar bachche ghayal ho gaye
 Everyone will have arguments
 kuch kashmir ke export honge
 There will be some hard statements
 in sabase goli apana rasta khoj leti he
 She changes the path chasing a terrorist
 kaniza ko kya pataa tha
 
 
 
 ek goli uske bistar tak aa rahi he
 Recently, when the condition of Jayalalithaa became serious, there was a spectacle on the streets of Chennai
 police ai
 The weeping supporters came, the legislature party started meeting at a place, and all the news inside the hospital got sorted on the channels like a mystery
 aam taur par dakshin bharat kii rozaana kii taqalifon se dur rahane vaale hindi channelon par chennai haaavee ho gaya
 People gathered on the streets of Chennai, police tension and crowds of millions gathered at the sea shore for the last rites
 gambhir or dukhad jhanon main bhi inhen tamaashe kii tarah hi uttar bharat ke darshakon kii duniya main thela gaya
 Because it did not require language
 aap ghar baithe sirf hangaame ke drishy dekh rahe the or bina gaharaai se jane dakshin bharat kii raajnneeti ke bare main jaagruk ho rahe the
 If there was no spectacle in all these moments, then hardly any Hindi channels or global channels running from Delhi would care what has happened in the south
 chennai se aage kii kahani to shaayad hi kabhi aati hogi
 Yes, if there is a spectacle about the Cauvery water agreement, hundreds of buses burn, people commit suicide then Tamil Nadu can take over TV again
 isamen aap darshakon kaa koi dosha nahin he
 TV is also not to blame
 na hi patrakarita kaa
 The fault is probably that of a tamasha who has no language
 tamaasha hi wo tatv he jo dilli se chalane vaale channelon ko chennai main badal detaa he or chennai se chalane vaale channelon ko imphal main
 So many times you have to leave your language and do the spectacle
 magar har baar tamaasha tamaasha nahin hota
 It is a concern within you
 bebasii, bechaini, laachaari hoti he
 Suppose you are Hindi speaking
 chennai main rahete hai yaa kerala main rahete hai
 Two is the number of four thousand
 hindi ke alaava koi bhashaa nahin aati
 But you are angry with any government policy
 zaahir he aap awaz uthaaenge
 Posters will come to Marina Beach with banners so that the convoy of ministers passing by can see you
 ho saktaa he ki un mantriyon ko hindi nahin aati ho
 People passing by do not know Hindi
 aapke poster or us par likhe hamaari maange puri karo ke naare bekaar ho jate hai
 You wish someone could read it
 samaj le ki ham kya kar rahe hai
 In such a situation, you will surely suffer, seek someone that will get off the bus, and will read the language of us and tell the government or the press what we are saying
 jab kuch nahin hoga tab aap kuch or aisa karenge jisase logon kii nazar pade ki kyon 100-200 log pradarshan kar rahe hai
 You will feel alone in your own country
 chikhenge, chillaayenge
 In the end, you will start playing different kinds of spectacle
 harakatein karenge
 Will take clothes off
 aag par chalenge
 Will sing the song
 aap khud ko bhashaa ke paar le jaayenge
 Many times when the students of the Northeast reach Jantar Mantar, the way in which they call the journalists, they can guess their yearning
 wo har kisi ko phone karte hai
 Do not know Hindi but speak English
 phir tuuti phooti hindi main bolte hai
 Someone will reach them, they will bring their talk to the country and the government through the media
 is tarah kaa phone jab bhi aata he, duusari taraf awaz kii bebasii daraati he
 If you find me too heavy, then make it easier
 dilli ke jantar mantar par qatari baddh baithe logon ko dekhiye
 They do not have the language for the media of Delhi
 isliye unhone apane sharir ko hi bhashaa kaa rup de diya he
 His body, his clothes are speaking
 ham sabane isi jantar mantar par dilli ke aas paas ke kisaanon kaa hujum dekha he, magar tamilnadu ke kisaanon ko shaayad nahin dekha he
 They do not know Hindi
 kuch kuch angrezi bol rahe hai magar wo bhi mushkil se
 So they have taken off their clothes
 mahilaayein sirf hare rang ke peticot main hai
 Men in green lungi
 hamane ye sawaal poocha ki haraa rang kyon
 The answer was green because it is the color of the farmers
 dharti kaa rang he
 The politics of North India is taking the idea of kesariya as Hindu and Hare as Muslim, but the farmers of the south are describing Hare as the color of the farmer
 ye kisaan dharm se baahar nahin he
 Tripund is made on everyone's body
 shiv ke bhakt malmu padate hai
 Some farmers have taken a bowl in hand
 angrezi main likhaa he begar yani bhikhaari
 It is written in English so that Delhi can understand
 bhikhaari banakar wo apni baat angrezi main aap tak pahunchaana chaahate hai
 Their banners are also not in Tamil
 angrezi main hai
 Some farmers put garland of Narmund in the neck
 ye pratik he un kisaanon kaa jinhone karze or kheti ke sankat se tang aakar aatmahatya kar lee he
 These farmers, numbering 100, are raising slogans in Tamil
 shaayad hi isaki awaz dilli ke aas paas ke kisaanon tak pahunche
 The farmer in India does not speak for the farmer
 shahar kisaan ke liye nahin bolte he
 Even if the language of slogans changes, the people listening to them do not change
 hamaare sahyogi munne bharti ne bahut prayaas kiya kisi se baat ho jaae
 Neither Munne could speak English nor Hindi
 donon taraf ek bich kii bhashaa bachi hui thi angrezi jisase ham kai baar nakli bhashaai swabhimaan ke naam par chidhate hai
 Who thought that debt-laden farmers, farmers who committed suicide, would have to resort to English
 marathi, punjabi, tamil sab bhashaaon ne kisaanon ko chhod diya he
 Delhi has its own horror of English
 dilli vaali angrezi kasbe vaali angrezi ko daraati he
 Munne Bharti talked to a farmer
 wo kya bol rahe hai ye mat suniye
 Look at the breakdown in how they are speaking
 agar aapako ye topic heavi lagata he to aap kuch or bhi dekhiye
 a large number of people of Tamil Nadu live in Delhi
 kabhi afasar banakar aae or dakshin dilli ke aarake puram main rahane lage
 After retiring from there, he settled towards Mayur Vihar
 or bhi kai jagahon par based hue hai
 These people told that the people of Tamil Nadu are coming and arranging for food
 samarthan jataa rahe hai
 It is also good that the people of this city are going among them, only ten to five
 yahi to hamaari khubi he
 As i said in TV, South India happens on the same occasions when there is a spectacle
 varna ham hindi kii duniya main kahaan tamilnadu ko lekar chintit hote hai ki vahaan pichley chaar maheene main chaar sau kisaanon ne aatmahatya kii he
 The Human Rights Commission, which sits in Delhi, has sent a notice to the state government on 5 January based on the press report there
 tamil dainik ne 3 janvari 2017 ko khabar chhaapi he ki dil kaa daura padane se 83 kisaanon kii maut hui he
 The same newspaper has reported on 5 January 2017 that the death toll of farmers has reached 106 in a month
 ayog ne likhaa tha ki niti banane vaale kisaanon ko nazarandaaz kar rahe hai
 Farmers need to be removed from the farming crisis
 usee vakt madras hoicourt ne bhi chaar hafton ke bheetar tamilnadu sarkaar ko halafanama daayar karne ke liye kaha tha ki sarkaar bataaye ki wo kya aisa karne ja rahi he jisase kisaanon kii aatmahatya ruk sake
 According to media reports, Tamil Nadu is in severe drought
 ham uttar bharatiyon ke liye to abhi garmi bhi nahin ai he magar dakshin ke hamaare priy rajya main sookhaa he
 The state government sought 39,565 crore help to deal with the drought
 ise aap package samajhate hai
 a drought has been declared in Tamil Nadu
 is saal northeast main barish 62 pratishat kam hui he
 This is the first time since 1876 there has been so little rain
 100 saal main pehali baar aisa sankat aayaa he phir bhi is sookhe kii daastaan aap tak laane ke liye kisi ko jantar mantar par nange badan khadey hona padataa he
 The water of Mettur Dam has reduced very much, the farmer can neither look towards the land nor look at the sky
 jantar mantar par jo kisaan aae hai unke paas bahut khet nahin hai
 All are small farmers
 inaki kuch maangen hai
 These farmers are going on hunger strike for 100 days
 inke paas hindi main ek parchaa he jis par sabase upar likhaa he, 'kisaan, jo raashtra ko ann dete hai, unki aatmahatya ko rokna
 Stop Tamil Nadu from becoming a desert
 kaveri nadi ko sookhne se rokna
 Constitution of Management Committee for Cauvery River
 krishi utpaadon ke liye uchit laabhadaayak mulya kaa nirdhaaran
 ' parche main yah bhi likhaa he, dukh ke saath bhukh hadtaal
 The name of the organization is South Indian Nadia Farmers Association
 hamaare liye to yah naam bhi nayaa he
 Nadia Farmers Association
 ye log nadiyon ko jodne kii maang karte hai
 In the morning Jantar Mantar came to show any support for these agitators
 unhone hamaare liye hindi main inaki samasya ko saamne rakhaa he
 Looking at the issue of farmers for so many days, one thing has been understood
 bharat ke kisaan laachaar nahin hai
 Farmers of India know how to make political decisions
 ve apane sankaton ke hisaab se raajnneetik faisla nahin karte hai balki puure samaaj ke liye faisla karte hai
 Otherwise farmers in many states do not vote for any political party
 jantar mantar par hi apane saamaan ke saath tamilnadu ke ye kisaan date hue hai
 Jantar Mantar is the real capital
 bharat kii samasyaon kaa ekmaatr pratinidhi sthal
 The Jantar Mantar that governments have imposed on the people, can only be the site of liberation from Jantar Mantar
 bharat main loktantr zindaa he jab tak jantar mantar zindaa he
 That is why this farmer lies on the bare open road
 kisaanon ko bhi neend aati he
 For three to four days, such rum has been lost as if it was Jantar Mantar
 ye jagah hi inke liye khet he
 Farmers suicide, drought crisis cover us all
 aisi koi baat nahin jiske bare main sarkaar ko na maaloom ho, patrkaar ne na likhaa ho
 The farmers are not getting the price
 kabhi kabhi muaavze mil jate hai
 Sometimes the loan gets forgiven
 lekin sankat or sookhaa har saal yaa har duusare saal laut aata he
 In Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu got the disease if the drought eradicated from the rains
 jab bhi koi suicide karata he, use pichhali suicide ke saath jod diya jaataa he
 106 farmers committed suicide
 yah kisaan 107waan tha
 Therefore, the suffering of the farmers is now beyond language
 jin logon ko bhashaa par bahut bharosa hota he unhen shuukravaar ke indian express ke pehle panne par chhapi bashaarat masood kii report padhani chahie
 The language of Kupwara of Kupwara in Kashmir was not even given a chance
 'maa kii bahon main so rahi thi
 His brother was sleeping next door
 ek goli ai jo kaniza ko khamosh kar gai
 The mother felt something sticky when she extended her hand towards the daughter
 gaur se dekha to bistar par koon failaa hua tha
 Kaniza had left this world
 baahar goli chal rahi thi
 Terrorists were hiding near Kaniza's house which was surrounded by security forces
 goli kiski bandook se chali pataa nahin chalaa
 But Kaniza, who was sleeping in another house, was killed
 uskaa bhai faisal bhi vahiin so rahaa tha
 got injured
 police waalon ne madad kii or astpal le jaaya gaya
 Faizal's life is saved but due to being in the hospital, Kaniza could not even see for the last time
 kashmir kii samasya bhi kisaanon kii samasya kii tarah he
 Everyone knows the crisis
 samaadhaan kisi ko nahin
 Now their problems have been overcome by language
 hamaari samvedanheenata kii koi bhashaa nahin he
 We have become like a bullet who silently kills a twelve-year-old girl and bounces her bed
 agar kaniza kii maa kii takalif ke liye koi bhashaa he to bataaiye
 Ask that language what Kaniza, who was sleeping, said when she was shot
 vahiin to uski maa so rahi thi
 His brother was sleeping there
 tippaniyan 'I loved Kaniza very much
 mere chaar bete hai
 i was the only daughter
 mere daahine haath par sar rakhkar so rahi thi
 Achaakan he breathed in shock
 maine uske badan par apana haath rakhaa to chipchipa sa laga
 When i saw my hands, i was red with blood
 maine kambal phenkaa to dekha ki chaaron taraf koon failaa hua tha
 The blood was flowing from her and Faizal's body
 ' ye kaniza kii maa kaa bayaan he jinhone indian express ke bashaarat masood ko isi tarah bataaya he ki kaise uski iklauti or behad pyaari beti kaniza maar di gai
 Nazir Masudi of NDTV also reached Kaniza's house
how difficult it would be for ek reporter ke liye kitna mushkil hota hoga aise vakt main logon se samvaad bananaa
 It is a dark room
 kaniza ke bhai khofazada hai
 Where the sister has gone suddenly is out of their comprehension
 13 saal ke asalam or 10 saal ke zafar kii ankhon main sab he magar unki bahan nahin he
 The house was far away but the bullets cover the distance
 ek hafte ke bheetar yah duusari ghatana he
 In Pulwama too, a child died of an encounter bullet
 15 saal kaa tha, maaraa gaya
 On 5 March, four children were injured in an explosion near the security forces camp in Sopore
 sabake paas daleelein hongi
 There will be some Kashmir experts
 kuch sakht bayaan honge
 All these bullets find their way
 wo kisi aatankwaadi kaa peechha karte karte rasta badal leti he
 What did Kaniza know
 
 
 
 a bullet is coming up to his bed
 dosha shaayad us tamaashe kaa he jisaki koi bhashaa nahin hoti he
 The pageant is the element that converts the channels running from Delhi to Chennai and the channels running from Chennai to Imphal
 isliye kai baar aapako apni bhashaa chhodkar tamaasha karnaa padataa he
 But every time a spectacle is not a spectacle
 wo aapke bheetar kii chitkaar hota he
 There is helplessness, restlessness, helplessness
 maan lijie aap hindi bhashi hai
 Live in Chennai or live in Kerala
 do chaar hazaar kii sankhya he
 There is no language other than Hindi
 magar aap sarkaar kii kisi niti se naaraaz hai
 Obviously you will raise your voice
 poster binar lekar marina bich par aa jaaenge taaki vahaan se guzarate mantriyon kaa kafila aapako dekh len
 May be those ministers do not know Hindi
 aas paas se guzarate logon ko hindi nahin aati ho
 The slogans of your poster and our demands written on it, become useless
 aapako lagata he ki kaash koi pard le
 Understand what we are doing
 aisi sthiti main yakeenan aap tadap uthenge, kisi aise kii talash karenge ki koi to bas se utrega or hamaari bhashaa padhakar sarkaar yaa press ko ittala kar degaa ki ham kya kah rahe hai
 When nothing happens, you will do something else that will make people see why 100-200 people are performing
 aap apane hi mulk main akelaa mahasoos karenge
 Will scream, scream
 ant main tarah tarah kaa tamaasha karne lagenge
 Will do things kapade utaarenge
 Will walk on fire
 geet gaayenge
 You will take yourself across the language
 kai baar purvottar ke chaatr jab jantar mantar pahunchate hai to jis andaaz main wo patrakaron ko phone karte hai, usase unki tadap kaa andaaza hota he
 They call everyone
 hindi nahin aati magar angrezi main bolte hai
 Then speak broken Hindi
 koi to pahonchega, unki baat media ke zariye desh or sarkaar ke saamne laaegaa
 Whenever such a call comes, the voicelessness on the other side scares
 aapako meri baat baari bharkam lagati ho to ise or aasaan kar detaa hum
 Look at the people sitting in queues at Jantar Mantar in Delhi
 inke paas dilli kii media ke liye bhashaa nahin he
 That is why they have given their bodies as language
 inkaa sharir, inke kapade bol rahe hai
 We have all seen the farmers around Delhi at this Jantar Mantar, but have not seen the farmers of Tamil Nadu
 inhen hindi nahin aati he
 Some are speaking English but they are also barely
 lihaaza inhone apane kapade utaar diye hai
 The women are just in green petticoats
 mard hare rang kii lungi main
 We asked the question why green
 jawaab mila haraa rang isliye kyonki ye kisaanon kaa rang he
 Is the color of the earth
 uttar bharat kii raajnneeti kesaria ko hindu or hare ko muslim samajhane main lagi he, magar dakshin ke kisaan hare ko kisaan kaa rang bataa rahe hai
 This farmer is not out of religion
 sabake badan par tripund bana he
 Shiva's devotees fall in love
 kuch kisaanon ne haath main katoraa liya he
 It is written in English that Beggar means beggar
 angreji main likhaa he taaki dilli samaj sake
 As a beggar, he wants to convey his words in English to you
 inke binar tamil main bhi nahin hai
 Are in English
 kuch kisaanon ne gale main narmund kii maala daal lee
 It is the symbol of those farmers who have committed suicide by being fed up with debt and farming crisis
 100 kii sankhya main aae ye kisaan tamil main naare laga rahe hai
 Hardly its voice reached the farmers around Delhi
 bharat main kisaan kisaan ke liye nahin bolta he
 The city does not speak for the farmer
 naaron kii bhashaa badal bhi jaati to bhi inhen sunne vaale log nahin badalte
 Our colleague Munne Bharti tried hard to talk to someone
 na munne angrezi bol sakate the na wo hindi
 There was a middle language left on both sides, English which we sometimes tease in the name of fake linguistic self-respect
 kisne sochaa tha ki karz se laden kisaanon ko, aatmahatya karne waalon kisaanon ko angrezi kaa sahaara lenaa padegaa
 Marathi, Punjabi, Tamil have all left the farmers
 dilli kii angrezi kii apni alag dehshat he
 The English town of Delhi scares the English
 munne bharti ne ek kisaan se baat kii
 Do not listen to what they are saying
 kis tarah se bol rahe hai, unke bolne main jo tuutan he, use dekhiye
 If you find this topic heavy, then see something else
 dilli main kaaphi sankhya main taminladu ke log rahete hai
 Sometimes came as an officer and started living in RK Puram in South Delhi
 vahaan se ritair hue to mayur vihaar kii taraf jaakar bas gaye
 Many more are inhabited
 in logon ne bataaya ki tamilnadu ke log aakar khaane pine kaa intazaam kar de rahe hai
 Are showing support ye bhi acha he ki das paanch hi sahi, is shahar ke log inke bich ja rahe hai
 This is our quality jaisaa ki maine kaha ki tivi main dakshin bharat unheen maukon par hota he jab tamaasha hota he
 Otherwise, where in the Hindi world are we concerned about Tamil Nadu, that in the last four months, four hundred farmers have committed suicide
 dilli main baithne vaale manvidhakaar ayog ne 5 janvari ko rajya sarkaar ko vahaan kii press report ke aadhaar par notice bheja he
 The Tamil daily reported on 3 January 2017 that 83 farmers had died due to heart attack
 usee akhbaar ne 5 janvari 2017 ko bataaya he ki ek maheene main kisaanon kii maut kaa aankada 106 par pahunch gaya he
 The Commission wrote that policy makers are ignoring farmers
 kisaanon ko kheti ke sankat se nikaalane kii zarurat he
 At the same time, the Madras High Court had also asked the Tamil Nadu government to file an affidavit within four weeks that the government should tell what it was going to do to stop the farmers' suicide
 media report ke anusaar tamilnadu main bhayankar sookhaa he
 We are not even hot for North Indians, but there is a drought in our beloved state of South
 rajya sarkaar ne sookhaa se nipatane ke liye 39,565 karod kii madad maangi
 You consider it a package
 tamilnadu main sookhaa ghoshit kar diya gaya he
 The rainfall in the Northeast has come down by 62 percent this year
 1876 ke baad pehali baar itani kam barish hui he
 For the first time in 100 years, such a crisis has come, yet one has to stand bare body at Jantar Mantar to bring the story of this drought to you
 mettoor baandh kaa pani bahut kam ho gaya he, kisaan na zamin kii taraf dekh saktaa he na aasmaan kii taraf taak saktaa he
 The farmers who have come to Jantar Mantar do not have much fields
 chote kisaan hi hai saare
 They have some demands
 ye kisaan 100 dinon ke liye bhukh hadtaal kar rahe hai
 They have a pamphlet in Hindi on which it is written at the top, 'farmers, who give food to the nation, to stop their suicide
 tamilnadu ko registan banane se rokna
 To prevent the Cauvery River from drying up
 kaveri nadi ke liye prabandhan samiti kaa gathan
 Determination of fair profitable prices for agricultural products
 ' It is also written in the pamphlet, hunger strike with sorrow
 sanghathan kaa naam he dakshin bhartiya nadiya kisaan sangh
 This name is also new to us
 nadiya kisaan sangh
 These people demand to connect the rivers
 subah jantar mantar par in andolankariyon ke liye koi samarthan jataane aayaa tha
 They have put their problem in front of us in Hindi
 itane dinon se kisaanon ke masale ko dekhte hue ek baat samaj ai he
 The farmers of India are not helpless
 bharat ke kisaan raajnneetik faisla karnaa jaanate hai
 They do not make political decisions according to their crises, but for the whole society
 varna kai rajyon main kisaan kisi raajnneetik dal ke liye vot hi nahin karte
 These farmers of Tamil Nadu are stuck with their belongings at Jantar Mantar itself
 jantar mantar hi asli rajdhani he
 The only representative site of India's problems
 sarkaron ne janata par jo jantar mantar kiya he, usase mukti kaa sthal jantar mantar hi ho saktaa he
 Democracy in India is alive as long as Jantar Mantar is alive
 tabhi to ye kisaan nange badan khuli sadak par let gaya he
 Farmers also get sleep
 teen chaar dinon se aise ram gaye hai jaise jantar mantar hi inkaa ghar ho
 This place is the farm for them
 kisaanon kii aatmahatya, sookhe kaa sankat ham sab cover karte hai
 There is nothing that the government does not know about, the journalist has not written
 kisaanon ko daam nahin mil rahe hai
 Sometimes compensation is received
 kabhi kabhaar karza maaf ho jaataa he
 But the crisis and drought returns every year or every other year
 maharashtra main barish se sookhe ne mukti pai to tamilnadu ko yah rog lag gaya
 Whenever someone commits suicide, it is added to the previous suicide
 106 kisaanon ne aatmahatya kii
 This farmer was 107th
 isliye kisaanon kii takaleef ab bhashaa ke paar he
 Those who have great faith in the language should read Basharat Masood's report printed on the front page of Friday's Indian Express
 kashmir ke kupwada kii kaniza ko to bhashaa ne uf karne tak kaa mauka nahin diya
 'sleeping in mother's arms
 bagal main uskaa bhai so rahaa tha
 a bullet arrived which silenced Kaniza
 maa ne jab apana haath beti kii taraf badhaayaa to kuch chipchipa sa mahasoos hua
 If i looked closely, the blood was spread on the bed
 kaniza is duniya se ja chuki thi
 Bullet was going on outside
 kaniza ke ghar ke paas main aatankwaadi chhipe the jinhen suraksha balon ne gher liya tha
 Whose gun shot was not known
 magar ek duusare ghar main so rahi kaniza ko maar gai
 His brother Faizal was also sleeping there
 ghayal ho gaya
 The policemen helped and Astpal was taken
 faisal kii jaan batch gai he magar aspataal main hone ke kaaran kaniza ko aakiri baar ke liye bhi nahin dekh paaya
 The problem of Kashmir is also like the problem of farmers
 sabko sankat maaloom he
 The solution is none
 ab unki takalif bhashaa ke paar ho chuki he
 There is no language of our insensitivity
 ham us goli kii tarah ho gaye hai jo ek baarah saal kii bacchee ko chupchaap maar kar, uske bistar ko lahooluhaan kar gaayab ho jate hai
 If there is any language for the suffering of Kaniza's mother, then tell it
 us bhashaa se puuchhiye ki neend main so rahi kaniza ne tab kya kaha tha, jab goli lagi thi
 His mother was sleeping there
 vahiin to uskaa bhai so rahaa tha
 The comments 'bahut pyaar karti thi kaniza ko
 i have four sons meri iklauti beti thi
 Sleeping with my head on my right hand
 achaakan usne jatke se saans lee
 When i put my hand on his body, it felt a bit sticky
 jab maine apni haathon ko dekha to koon se laal ho gaye the
 When i threw the blanket, i saw that there was blood all around
 uske or faijal ke badan se koon bah rahaa tha
 This is the statement of Kaniza's mother who told Basharat Masood of the Indian Express how his only and very dear daughter Kaniza was killed
 enditivi ke nazir masudi bhi kaniza ke ghar pahunche
 How difficult it would be for a reporter to communicate with people in such times
 andhera sa cameraa he
 Kaniza's brother is Kafzada
 bahan achaanak kahaan chali gai he ye unki samaj se baahar he
 13-year-old Aslam and 10-year-old Zafar all have eyes but their sister is not
 ghar dur tha magar goliyaan duuri tay kar leti hai
 This is the second incident within a week
 pulavama main bhi encounter kii goliyon kaa shikaar ek baccha ho gaya
 Was 15 years old, killed
 5 march ko sopor main suraksha balon ke camp ke nazadik visphot hone se chaar bachche ghayal ho gaye
 Everyone will have arguments
 kuch kashmir ke export honge
 There will be some hard statements
 in sabase goli apana rasta khoj leti he
 She changes the path chasing a terrorist
 kaniza ko kya pataa tha
 
 
 
 ek goli uske bistar tak aa rahi he
 Suppose you are Hindi speaking
 chennai main rahete hai yaa kerala main rahete hai
 Two is the number of four thousand
 hindi ke alaava koi bhashaa nahin aati
 But you are angry with any government policy
 zaahir he aap awaz uthaaenge
 Posters will come to Marina Beach with banners so that the convoy of ministers passing by can see you
 ho saktaa he ki un mantriyon ko hindi nahin aati ho
 People passing by do not know Hindi
 aapke poster or us par likhe hamaari maange puri karo ke naare bekaar ho jate hai
 You wish someone could read it
 samaj le ki ham kya kar rahe hai
 In such a situation, you will surely suffer, seek someone that will get off the bus, and will read the language of us and tell the government or the press what we are saying
 jab kuch nahin hoga tab aap kuch or aisa karenge jisase logon kii nazar pade ki kyon 100-200 log pradarshan kar rahe hai
 You will feel alone in your own country
 chikhenge, chillaayenge
 In the end, you will start playing different kinds of spectacle
 harakatein karenge
 Will take clothes off
 aag par chalenge
 Will sing the song
 aap khud ko bhashaa ke paar le jaayenge
 Many times when the students of the Northeast reach Jantar Mantar, the way in which they call the journalists, they can guess their yearning
 wo har kisi ko phone karte hai
 Do not know Hindi but speak English
 phir tuuti phooti hindi main bolte hai
 Someone will reach them, they will bring their talk to the country and the government through the media
 is tarah kaa phone jab bhi aata he, duusari taraf awaz kii bebasii daraati he
 If you find me too heavy, then make it easier
 dilli ke jantar mantar par qatari baddh baithe logon ko dekhiye
 They do not have the language for the media of Delhi
 isliye unhone apane sharir ko hi bhashaa kaa rup de diya he
 His body, his clothes are speaking
 ham sabane isi jantar mantar par dilli ke aas paas ke kisaanon kaa hujum dekha he, magar tamilnadu ke kisaanon ko shaayad nahin dekha he
 They do not know Hindi
 kuch kuch angrezi bol rahe hai magar wo bhi mushkil se
 So they have taken off their clothes
 mahilaayein sirf hare rang ke peticot main hai
 Men in green lungi
 hamane ye sawaal poocha ki haraa rang kyon
 The answer was green because it is the color of the farmers
 dharti kaa rang he
 The politics of North India is taking the idea of kesariya as Hindu and Hare as Muslim, but the farmers of the south are describing Hare as the color of the farmer
 ye kisaan dharm se baahar nahin he
 Tripund is made on everyone's body
 shiv ke bhakt malmu padate hai
 Some farmers have taken a bowl in hand
 angrezi main likhaa he begar yani bhikhaari
 It is written in English so that Delhi can understand
 bhikhaari banakar wo apni baat angrezi main aap tak pahunchaana chaahate hai
 Their banners are also not in Tamil
 angrezi main hai
 Some farmers put garland of Narmund in the neck
 ye pratik he un kisaanon kaa jinhone karze or kheti ke sankat se tang aakar aatmahatya kar lee he
 These farmers, numbering 100, are raising slogans in Tamil
 shaayad hi isaki awaz dilli ke aas paas ke kisaanon tak pahunche
 The farmer in India does not speak for the farmer
 shahar kisaan ke liye nahin bolte he
 Even if the language of slogans changes, the people listening to them do not change
 hamaare sahyogi munne bharti ne bahut prayaas kiya kisi se baat ho jaae
 Neither Munne could speak English nor Hindi
 donon taraf ek bich kii bhashaa bachi hui thi angrezi jisase ham kai baar nakli bhashaai swabhimaan ke naam par chidhate hai
 Who thought that debt-laden farmers, farmers who committed suicide, would have to resort to English
 marathi, punjabi, tamil sab bhashaaon ne kisaanon ko chhod diya he
 Delhi has its own horror of English
 dilli vaali angrezi kasbe vaali angrezi ko daraati he
 Munne Bharti talked to a farmer
 wo kya bol rahe hai ye mat suniye
 Look at the breakdown in how they are speaking
 agar aapako ye topic heavi lagata he to aap kuch or bhi dekhiye
 a large number of people of Tamil Nadu live in Delhi
 kabhi afasar banakar aae or dakshin dilli ke aarake puram main rahane lage
 After retiring from there, he settled towards Mayur Vihar
 or bhi kai jagahon par based hue hai
 These people told that the people of Tamil Nadu are coming and arranging for food
 samarthan jataa rahe hai
 It is also good that the people of this city are going among them, only ten to five
 yahi to hamaari khubi he
 As i said in TV, South India happens on the same occasions when there is a spectacle
 varna ham hindi kii duniya main kahaan tamilnadu ko lekar chintit hote hai ki vahaan pichley chaar maheene main chaar sau kisaanon ne aatmahatya kii he
 The Human Rights Commission, which sits in Delhi, has sent a notice to the state government on 5 January based on the press report there
 tamil dainik ne 3 janvari 2017 ko khabar chhaapi he ki dil kaa daura padane se 83 kisaanon kii maut hui he
 The same newspaper has reported on 5 January 2017 that the death toll of farmers has reached 106 in a month
 ayog ne likhaa tha ki niti banane vaale kisaanon ko nazarandaaz kar rahe hai
 Farmers need to be removed from the farming crisis
 usee vakt madras hoicourt ne bhi chaar hafton ke bheetar tamilnadu sarkaar ko halafanama daayar karne ke liye kaha tha ki sarkaar bataaye ki wo kya aisa karne ja rahi he jisase kisaanon kii aatmahatya ruk sake
 According to media reports, Tamil Nadu is in severe drought
 ham uttar bharatiyon ke liye to abhi garmi bhi nahin ai he magar dakshin ke hamaare priy rajya main sookhaa he
 The state government sought 39,565 crore help to deal with the drought
 ise aap package samajhate hai
 a drought has been declared in Tamil Nadu
 is saal northeast main barish 62 pratishat kam hui he
 This is the first time since 1876 there has been so little rain
 100 saal main pehali baar aisa sankat aayaa he phir bhi is sookhe kii daastaan aap tak laane ke liye kisi ko jantar mantar par nange badan khadey hona padataa he
 The water of Mettur Dam has reduced very much, the farmer can neither look towards the land nor look at the sky
 jantar mantar par jo kisaan aae hai unke paas bahut khet nahin hai
 All are small farmers
 inaki kuch maangen hai
 These farmers are going on hunger strike for 100 days
 inke paas hindi main ek parchaa he jis par sabase upar likhaa he, 'kisaan, jo raashtra ko ann dete hai, unki aatmahatya ko rokna
 Stop Tamil Nadu from becoming a desert
 kaveri nadi ko sookhne se rokna
 Constitution of Management Committee for Cauvery River
 krishi utpaadon ke liye uchit laabhadaayak mulya kaa nirdhaaran
 ' parche main yah bhi likhaa he, dukh ke saath bhukh hadtaal
 The name of the organization is South Indian Nadia Farmers Association
 hamaare liye to yah naam bhi nayaa he
 Nadia Farmers Association
 ye log nadiyon ko jodne kii maang karte hai
 In the morning Jantar Mantar came to show any support for these agitators
 unhone hamaare liye hindi main inaki samasya ko saamne rakhaa he
 Looking at the issue of farmers for so many days, one thing has been understood
 bharat ke kisaan laachaar nahin hai
 Farmers of India know how to make political decisions
 ve apane sankaton ke hisaab se raajnneetik faisla nahin karte hai balki puure samaaj ke liye faisla karte hai
 Otherwise farmers in many states do not vote for any political party
 jantar mantar par hi apane saamaan ke saath tamilnadu ke ye kisaan date hue hai
 Jantar Mantar is the real capital
 bharat kii samasyaon kaa ekmaatr pratinidhi sthal
 The Jantar Mantar that governments have imposed on the people, can only be the site of liberation from Jantar Mantar
 bharat main loktantr zindaa he jab tak jantar mantar zindaa he
 That is why this farmer lies on the bare open road
 kisaanon ko bhi neend aati he
 For three to four days, such rum has been lost as if it was Jantar Mantar
 ye jagah hi inke liye khet he
 Farmers suicide, drought crisis cover us all
 aisi koi baat nahin jiske bare main sarkaar ko na maaloom ho, patrkaar ne na likhaa ho
 The farmers are not getting the price
 kabhi kabhi muaavze mil jate hai
 Sometimes the loan gets forgiven
 lekin sankat or sookhaa har saal yaa har duusare saal laut aata he
 In Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu got the disease if the drought eradicated from the rains
 jab bhi koi suicide karata he, use pichhali suicide ke saath jod diya jaataa he
 106 farmers committed suicide
 yah kisaan 107waan tha
 Therefore, the suffering of the farmers is now beyond language
 jin logon ko bhashaa par bahut bharosa hota he unhen shuukravaar ke indian express ke pehle panne par chhapi bashaarat masood kii report padhani chahie
 The language of Kupwara of Kupwara in Kashmir was not even given a chance
 'maa kii bahon main so rahi thi
 His brother was sleeping next door
 ek goli ai jo kaniza ko khamosh kar gai
 The mother felt something sticky when she extended her hand towards the daughter
 gaur se dekha to bistar par koon failaa hua tha
 Kaniza had left this world
 baahar goli chal rahi thi
 Terrorists were hiding near Kaniza's house which was surrounded by security forces
 goli kiski bandook se chali pataa nahin chalaa
 But Kaniza, who was sleeping in another house, was killed
 uskaa bhai faisal bhi vahiin so rahaa tha
 got injured
 police waalon ne madad kii or astpal le jaaya gaya
 Faizal's life is saved but due to being in the hospital, Kaniza could not even see for the last time
 kashmir kii samasya bhi kisaanon kii samasya kii tarah he
 Everyone knows the crisis
 samaadhaan kisi ko nahin
 Now their problems have been overcome by language
 hamaari samvedanheenata kii koi bhashaa nahin he
 We have become like a bullet who silently kills a twelve-year-old girl and bounces her bed
 agar kaniza kii maa kii takalif ke liye koi bhashaa he to bataaiye
 Ask that language what Kaniza, who was sleeping, said when she was shot
 vahiin to uski maa so rahi thi
 His brother was sleeping there

 mere chaar bete hai
 i was the only daughter

 When i saw my hands, i was red with blood
 maine kambal phenkaa to dekha ki chaaron taraf koon failaa hua tha
 The blood was flowing from her and Faizal's body
 ' ye kaniza kii maa kaa bayaan he jinhone indian express ke bashaarat masood ko isi tarah bataaya he ki kaise uski iklauti or behad pyaari beti kaniza maar di gai
 Nazir Masudi of NDTV also reached Kaniza's house
 ek reporter ke liye kitna mushkil hota hoga aise vakt main logon se samvaad bananaa
 It is a dark room
 kaniza ke bhai khofazada hai
 Where the sister has gone suddenly is out of their comprehension

 kisne sochaa tha ki karz se laden kisaanon ko, aatmahatya karne waalon kisaanon ko angrezi kaa sahaara lenaa padegaa
 Marathi, Punjabi, Tamil have all left the farmers
 dilli kii angrezi kii apni alag dehshat he
 The English town of Delhi scares the English
 munne bharti ne ek kisaan se baat kii
 Do not listen to what they are saying
 kis tarah se bol rahe hai, unke bolne main jo tuutan he, use dekhiye
 If you find this topic heavy, then see something else
 dilli main kaaphi sankhya main taminladu ke log rahete hai
 Sometimes came as an officer and started living in RK Puram in South Delhi
 vahaan se ritair hue to mayur vihaar kii taraf jaakar bas gaye
 Many more are inhabited
 in logon ne bataaya ki tamilnadu ke log aakar khaane pine kaa intazaam kar de rahe hai
 Are showing support ye bhi acha he ki das paanch hi sahi, is shahar ke log inke bich ja rahe hai
 This is our quality jaisaa ki maine kaha ki tivi main dakshin bharat unheen maukon par hota he jab tamaasha hota he
 Otherwise, where in the Hindi world are we concerned about Tamil Nadu, that in the last four months, four hundred farmers have committed suicide
 dilli main baithne vaale manvidhakaar ayog ne 5 janvari ko rajya sarkaar ko vahaan kii press report ke aadhaar par notice bheja he
 The Tamil daily reported on 3 January 2017 that 83 farmers had died due to heart attack
 usee akhbaar ne 5 janvari 2017 ko bataaya he ki ek maheene main kisaanon kii maut kaa aankada 106 par pahunch gaya he
 The Commission wrote that policy makers are ignoring farmers
 kisaanon ko kheti ke sankat se nikaalane kii zarurat he
 At the same time, the Madras High Court had also asked the Tamil Nadu government to file an affidavit within four weeks that the government should tell what it was going to do to stop the farmers' suicide
 media report ke anusaar tamilnadu main bhayankar sookhaa he
 We are not even hot for North Indians, but there is a drought in our beloved state of South
 rajya sarkaar ne sookhaa se nipatane ke liye 39,565 karod kii madad maangi
 You consider it a package
 tamilnadu main sookhaa ghoshit kar diya gaya he
 The rainfall in the Northeast has come down by 62 percent this year
 1876 ke baad pehali baar itani kam barish hui he
 For the first time in 100 years, such a crisis has come, yet one has to stand bare body at Jantar Mantar to bring the story of this drought to you
 mettoor baandh kaa pani bahut kam ho gaya he, kisaan na zamin kii taraf dekh saktaa he na aasmaan kii taraf taak saktaa he
 The farmers who have come to Jantar Mantar do not have much fields
 chote kisaan hi hai saare
 They have some demands
 ye kisaan 100 dinon ke liye bhukh hadtaal kar rahe hai
 They have a pamphlet in Hindi on which it is written at the top, 'farmers, who give food to the nation, to stop their suicide
 tamilnadu ko registan banane se rokna
 To prevent the Cauvery River from drying up
 kaveri nadi ke liye prabandhan samiti kaa gathan
 Determination of fair profitable prices for agricultural products
 ' It is also written in the pamphlet, hunger strike with sorrow
 sanghathan kaa naam he dakshin bhartiya nadiya kisaan sangh
 This name is also new to us
 nadiya kisaan sangh
 These people demand to connect the rivers
 subah jantar mantar par in andolankariyon ke liye koi samarthan jataane aayaa tha
 They have put their problem in front of us in Hindi
 itane dinon se kisaanon ke masale ko dekhte hue ek baat samaj ai he
 The farmers of India are not helpless
 bharat ke kisaan raajnneetik faisla karnaa jaanate hai
 They do not make political decisions according to their crises, but for the whole society
 varna kai rajyon main kisaan kisi raajnneetik dal ke liye vot hi nahin karte
 These farmers of Tamil Nadu are stuck with their belongings at Jantar Mantar itself
 jantar mantar hi asli rajdhani he
 The only representative site of India's problems
 sarkaron ne janata par jo jantar mantar kiya he, usase mukti kaa sthal jantar mantar hi ho saktaa he
 Democracy in India is alive as long as Jantar Mantar is alive
 tabhi to ye kisaan nange badan khuli sadak par let gaya he
 Farmers also get sleep
 teen chaar dinon se aise ram gaye hai jaise jantar mantar hi inkaa ghar ho
 This place is the farm for them
 kisaanon kii aatmahatya, sookhe kaa sankat ham sab cover karte hai
 There is nothing that the government does not know about, the journalist has not written
 kisaanon ko daam nahin mil rahe hai
 Sometimes compensation is received
 kabhi kabhaar karza maaf ho jaataa he
 But the crisis and drought returns every year or every other year
 maharashtra main barish se sookhe ne mukti pai to tamilnadu ko yah rog lag gaya
 Whenever someone commits suicide, it is added to the previous suicide
 106 kisaanon ne aatmahatya kii
 This farmer was 107th
 isliye kisaanon kii takaleef ab bhashaa ke paar he
 Those who have great faith in the language should read Basharat Masood's report printed on the front page of Friday's Indian Express
 kashmir ke kupwada kii kaniza ko to bhashaa ne uf karne tak kaa mauka nahin diya
 'sleeping in mother's arms
 bagal main uskaa bhai so rahaa tha
 a bullet arrived which silenced Kaniza
 maa ne jab apana haath beti kii taraf badhaayaa to kuch chipchipa sa mahasoos hua
 If i looked closely, the blood was spread on the bed
 kaniza is duniya se ja chuki thi
 Bullet was going on outside
 kaniza ke ghar ke paas main aatankwaadi chhipe the jinhen suraksha balon ne gher liya tha
 Whose gun shot was not known
 magar ek duusare ghar main so rahi kaniza ko maar gai
 His brother Faizal was also sleeping there
 ghayal ho gaya
 The policemen helped and Astpal was taken
 faisal kii jaan batch gai he magar aspataal main hone ke kaaran kaniza ko aakiri baar ke liye bhi nahin dekh paaya
 The problem of Kashmir is also like the problem of farmers
 sabko sankat maaloom he
 The solution is none
 ab unki takalif bhashaa ke paar ho chuki he
 There is no language of our insensitivity
 ham us goli kii tarah ho gaye hai jo ek baarah saal kii bacchee ko chupchaap maar kar, uske bistar ko lahooluhaan kar gaayab ho jate hai
 If there is any language for the suffering of Kaniza's mother, then tell it
 us bhashaa se puuchhiye ki neend main so rahi kaniza ne tab kya kaha tha, jab goli lagi thi
 His mother was sleeping there
 vahiin to uskaa bhai so rahaa tha
 The comments 'bahut pyaar karti thi kaniza ko
 i have four sons meri iklauti beti thi
 Sleeping with my head on my right hand
 achaakan usne jatke se saans lee
 When i put my hand on his body, it felt a bit sticky
 jab maine apni haathon ko dekha to koon se laal ho gaye the
 When i threw the blanket, i saw that there was blood all around
 uske or faijal ke badan se koon bah rahaa tha
 This is the statement of Kaniza's mother who told Basharat Masood of the Indian Express how his only and very dear daughter Kaniza was killed
 enditivi ke nazir masudi bhi kaniza ke ghar pahunche
 How difficult it would be for a reporter to communicate with people in such times
 andhera sa cameraa he
 Kaniza's brother is Kafzada
 bahan achaanak kahaan chali gai he ye unki samaj se baahar he
 13-year-old Aslam and 10-year-old Zafar all have eyes but their sister is not
 ghar dur tha magar goliyaan duuri tay kar leti hai
 This is the second incident within a week
 pulavama main bhi encounter kii goliyon kaa shikaar ek baccha ho gaya
 Was 15 years old, killed
 5 march ko sopor main suraksha balon ke camp ke nazadik visphot hone se chaar bachche ghayal ho gaye
 Everyone will have arguments
 kuch kashmir ke export honge
 There will be some hard statements
 in sabase goli apana rasta khoj leti he
 She changes the path chasing a terrorist
 kaniza ko kya pataa tha
 
 
 
 ek goli uske bistar tak aa rahi he
 Look at the people sitting in queues at Jantar Mantar in Delhi
 inke paas dilli kii media ke liye bhashaa nahin he
 That is why they have given their bodies as language
 inkaa sharir, inke kapade bol rahe hai
 We have all seen the farmers around Delhi at this Jantar Mantar, but have not seen the farmers of Tamil Nadu
 inhen hindi nahin aati he
 Some are speaking English but they are also barely
 lihaaza inhone apane kapade utaar diye hai
 The women are just in green petticoats
 mard hare rang kii lungi main
 We asked the question why green
 jawaab mila haraa rang isliye kyonki ye kisaanon kaa rang he
 Is the color of the earth
 uttar bharat kii raajnneeti kesaria ko hindu or hare ko muslim samajhane main lagi he, magar dakshin ke kisaan hare ko kisaan kaa rang bataa rahe hai
 This farmer is not out of religion
 sabake badan par tripund bana he
 Shiva's devotees fall in love
 kuch kisaanon ne haath main katoraa liya he
 It is written in English that Beggar means beggar
 angreji main likhaa he taaki dilli samaj sake
 As a beggar, he wants to convey his words in English to you
 inke binar tamil main bhi nahin hai
 Are in English
 kuch kisaanon ne gale main narmund kii maala daal lee
 It is the symbol of those farmers who have committed suicide by being fed up with debt and farming crisis
 100 kii sankhya main aae ye kisaan tamil main naare laga rahe hai
 Hardly its voice reached the farmers around Delhi
 bharat main kisaan kisaan ke liye nahin bolta he
 The city does not speak for the farmer
 naaron kii bhashaa badal bhi jaati to bhi inhen sunne vaale log nahin badalte
 Our colleague Munne Bharti tried hard to talk to someone

 These farmers, numbering 100, are raising slogans in Tamil
 shaayad hi isaki awaz dilli ke aas paas ke kisaanon tak pahunche
 The farmer in India does not speak for the farmer
 shahar kisaan ke liye nahin bolte he
 Even if the language of slogans changes, the people listening to them do not change
 hamaare sahyogi munne bharti ne bahut prayaas kiya kisi se baat ho jaae
 Neither Munne could speak English nor Hindi
 donon taraf ek bich kii bhashaa bachi hui thi angrezi jisase ham kai baar nakli bhashaai swabhimaan ke naam par chidhate hai
 Who thought that debt-laden farmers, farmers who committed suicide, would have to resort to English
 marathi, punjabi, tamil sab bhashaaon ne kisaanon ko chhod diya he
 Delhi has its own horror of English
 dilli vaali angrezi kasbe vaali angrezi ko daraati he
 Munne Bharti talked to a farmer
 wo kya bol rahe hai ye mat suniye
 Look at the breakdown in how they are speaking
 agar aapako ye topic heavi lagata he to aap kuch or bhi dekhiye
 a large number of people of Tamil Nadu live in Delhi
 kabhi afasar banakar aae or dakshin dilli ke aarake puram main rahane lage
 After retiring from there, he settled towards Mayur Vihar
 or bhi kai jagahon par based hue hai
 These people told that the people of Tamil Nadu are coming and arranging for food
 samarthan jataa rahe hai
 It is also good that the people of this city are going among them, only ten to five
 yahi to hamaari khubi he
 As i said in TV, South India happens on the same occasions when there is a spectacle
 varna ham hindi kii duniya main kahaan tamilnadu ko lekar chintit hote hai ki vahaan pichley chaar maheene main chaar sau kisaanon ne aatmahatya kii he
 The Human Rights Commission, which sits in Delhi, has sent a notice to the state government on 5 January based on the press report there
 tamil dainik ne 3 janvari 2017 ko khabar chhaapi he ki dil kaa daura padane se 83 kisaanon kii maut hui he
 The same newspaper has reported on 5 January 2017 that the death toll of farmers has reached 106 in a month
 ayog ne likhaa tha ki niti banane vaale kisaanon ko nazarandaaz kar rahe hai
 Farmers need to be removed from the farming crisis
 usee vakt madras hoicourt ne bhi chaar hafton ke bheetar tamilnadu sarkaar ko halafanama daayar karne ke liye kaha tha ki sarkaar bataaye ki wo kya aisa karne ja rahi he jisase kisaanon kii aatmahatya ruk sake
 According to media reports, Tamil Nadu is in severe drought
 ham uttar bharatiyon ke liye to abhi garmi bhi nahin ai he magar dakshin ke hamaare priy rajya main sookhaa he
 The state government sought 39,565 crore help to deal with the drought
 ise aap package samajhate hai
 a drought has been declared in Tamil Nadu
 is saal northeast main barish 62 pratishat kam hui he
 This is the first time since 1876 there has been so little rain
 100 saal main pehali baar aisa sankat aayaa he phir bhi is sookhe kii daastaan aap tak laane ke liye kisi ko jantar mantar par nange badan khadey hona padataa he
 The water of Mettur Dam has reduced very much, the farmer can neither look towards the land nor look at the sky
 jantar mantar par jo kisaan aae hai unke paas bahut khet nahin hai
 All are small farmers
 inaki kuch maangen hai
 These farmers are going on hunger strike for 100 days
 inke paas hindi main ek parchaa he jis par sabase upar likhaa he, 'kisaan, jo raashtra ko ann dete hai, unki aatmahatya ko rokna
 Stop Tamil Nadu from becoming a desert
 kaveri nadi ko sookhne se rokna
 Constitution of Management Committee for Cauvery River
 krishi utpaadon ke liye uchit laabhadaayak mulya kaa nirdhaaran
 ' parche main yah bhi likhaa he, dukh ke saath bhukh hadtaal
 The name of the organization is South Indian Nadia Farmers Association
 hamaare liye to yah naam bhi nayaa he
 Nadia Farmers Association
 ye log nadiyon ko jodne kii maang karte hai
 In the morning Jantar Mantar came to show any support for these agitators
 unhone hamaare liye hindi main inaki samasya ko saamne rakhaa he
 Looking at the issue of farmers for so many days, one thing has been understood
 bharat ke kisaan laachaar nahin hai
 Farmers of India know how to make political decisions
 ve apane sankaton ke hisaab se raajnneetik faisla nahin karte hai balki puure samaaj ke liye faisla karte hai
 Otherwise farmers in many states do not vote for any political party
 jantar mantar par hi apane saamaan ke saath tamilnadu ke ye kisaan date hue hai
 Jantar Mantar is the real capital
 bharat kii samasyaon kaa ekmaatr pratinidhi sthal
 The Jantar Mantar that governments have imposed on the people, can only be the site of liberation from Jantar Mantar
 bharat main loktantr zindaa he jab tak jantar mantar zindaa he
 That is why this farmer lies on the bare open road
 kisaanon ko bhi neend aati he
 For three to four days, such rum has been lost as if it was Jantar Mantar
 ye jagah hi inke liye khet he
 Farmers suicide, drought crisis cover us all
 aisi koi baat nahin jiske bare main sarkaar ko na maaloom ho, patrkaar ne na likhaa ho
 The farmers are not getting the price
 kabhi kabhi muaavze mil jate hai
 Sometimes the loan gets forgiven
 lekin sankat or sookhaa har saal yaa har duusare saal laut aata he
 In Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu got the disease if the drought eradicated from the rains
 jab bhi koi suicide karata he, use pichhali suicide ke saath jod diya jaataa he
 106 farmers committed suicide
 yah kisaan 107waan tha
 Therefore, the suffering of the farmers is now beyond language
 jin logon ko bhashaa par bahut bharosa hota he unhen shuukravaar ke indian express ke pehle panne par chhapi bashaarat masood kii report padhani chahie
 The language of Kupwara of Kupwara in Kashmir was not even given a chance
 'maa kii bahon main so rahi thi
 His brother was sleeping next door
 ek goli ai jo kaniza ko khamosh kar gai
 The mother felt something sticky when she extended her hand towards the daughter
 gaur se dekha to bistar par koon failaa hua tha
 Kaniza had left this world
 baahar goli chal rahi thi
 Terrorists were hiding near Kaniza's house which was surrounded by security forces
 goli kiski bandook se chali pataa nahin chalaa
 But Kaniza, who was sleeping in another house, was killed
 uskaa bhai faisal bhi vahiin so rahaa tha
 got injured
 police waalon ne madad kii or astpal le jaaya gaya
 Faizal's life is saved but due to being in the hospital, Kaniza could not even see for the last time
 kashmir kii samasya bhi kisaanon kii samasya kii tarah he
 Everyone knows the crisis
 samaadhaan kisi ko nahin
 Now their problems have been overcome by language
 hamaari samvedanheenata kii koi bhashaa nahin he
 We have become like a bullet who silently kills a twelve-year-old girl and bounces her bed
 agar kaniza kii maa kii takalif ke liye koi bhashaa he to bataaiye
 Ask that language what Kaniza, who was sleeping, said when she was shot
 vahiin to uski maa so rahi thi
 His brother was sleeping there
 tippaniyan 'I loved Kaniza very much
 mere chaar bete hai
 i was the only daughter
 mere daahine haath par sar rakhkar so rahi thi
 Achaakan he breathed in shock
 maine uske badan par apana haath rakhaa to chipchipa sa laga
 When i saw my hands, i was red with blood
 maine kambal phenkaa to dekha ki chaaron taraf koon failaa hua tha
 The blood was flowing from her and Faizal's body
 ' ye kaniza kii maa kaa bayaan he jinhone indian express ke bashaarat masood ko isi tarah bataaya he ki kaise uski iklauti or behad pyaari beti kaniza maar di gai
 Nazir Masudi of NDTV also reached Kaniza's house
 ek reporter ke liye kitna mushkil hota hoga aise vakt main logon se samvaad bananaa
 It is a dark room
 kaniza ke bhai khofazada hai
 Where the sister has gone suddenly is out of their comprehension
 13 saal ke asalam or 10 saal ke zafar kii ankhon main sab he magar unki bahan nahin he
 The house was far away but the bullets cover the distance
 ek hafte ke bheetar yah duusari ghatana he
 In Pulwama too, a child died of an encounter bullet
 15 saal kaa tha, maaraa gaya
 On 5 March, four children were injured in an explosion near the security forces camp in Sopore
 sabake paas daleelein hongi
 There will be some Kashmir experts
 kuch sakht bayaan honge
 All these bullets find their way
 wo kisi aatankwaadi kaa peechha karte karte rasta badal leti he
 What did Kaniza know
 
 
 
 a bullet is coming up to his bed
 dilli main kaaphi sankhya main taminladu ke log rahete hai
 Sometimes came as an officer and started living in RK Puram in South Delhi
 vahaan se ritair hue to mayur vihaar kii taraf jaakar bas gaye
 Many more are inhabited
 in logon ne bataaya ki tamilnadu ke log aakar khaane pine kaa intazaam kar de rahe hai
 Are showing support ye bhi acha he ki das paanch hi sahi, is shahar ke log inke bich ja rahe hai
 This is our quality jaisaa ki maine kaha ki tivi main dakshin bharat unheen maukon par hota he jab tamaasha hota he
 Otherwise, where in the Hindi world are we concerned about Tamil Nadu, that in the last four months, four hundred farmers have committed suicide
 dilli main baithne vaale manvidhakaar ayog ne 5 janvari ko rajya sarkaar ko vahaan kii press report ke aadhaar par notice bheja he
 The Tamil daily reported on 3 January 2017 that 83 farmers had died due to heart attack
 usee akhbaar ne 5 janvari 2017 ko bataaya he ki ek maheene main kisaanon kii maut kaa aankada 106 par pahunch gaya he
 The Commission wrote that policy makers are ignoring farmers
 kisaanon ko kheti ke sankat se nikaalane kii zarurat he
 At the same time, the Madras High Court had also asked the Tamil Nadu government to file an affidavit within four weeks that the government should tell what it was going to do to stop the farmers' suicide
 media report ke anusaar tamilnadu main bhayankar sookhaa he
 We are not even hot for North Indians, but there is a drought in our beloved state of South
 rajya sarkaar ne sookhaa se nipatane ke liye 39,565 karod kii madad maangi
 You consider it a package
 tamilnadu main sookhaa ghoshit kar diya gaya he
 The rainfall in the Northeast has come down by 62 percent this year
 1876 ke baad pehali baar itani kam barish hui he
 For the first time in 100 years, such a crisis has come, yet one has to stand bare body at Jantar Mantar to bring the story of this drought to you
 mettoor baandh kaa pani bahut kam ho gaya he, kisaan na zamin kii taraf dekh saktaa he na aasmaan kii taraf taak saktaa he
 The farmers who have come to Jantar Mantar do not have much fields
 chote kisaan hi hai saare
 They have some demands
 ye kisaan 100 dinon ke liye bhukh hadtaal kar rahe hai
 They have a pamphlet in Hindi on which it is written at the top, 'farmers, who give food to the nation, to stop their suicide
 tamilnadu ko registan banane se rokna
 To prevent the Cauvery River from drying up
 kaveri nadi ke liye prabandhan samiti kaa gathan
 Determination of fair profitable prices for agricultural products
 ' It is also written in the pamphlet, hunger strike with sorrow
 sanghathan kaa naam he dakshin bhartiya nadiya kisaan sangh
 This name is also new to us
 nadiya kisaan sangh
 These people demand to connect the rivers

 They have put their problem in front of us in Hindi
 itane dinon se kisaanon ke masale ko dekhte hue ek baat samaj ai he
 The farmers of India are not helpless
 bharat ke kisaan raajnneetik faisla karnaa jaanate hai
 They do not make political decisions according to their crises, but for the whole society
 varna kai rajyon main kisaan kisi raajnneetik dal ke liye vot hi nahin karte
 These farmers of Tamil Nadu are stuck with their belongings at Jantar Mantar itself
 jantar mantar hi asli rajdhani he
 The only representative site of India's problems
 sarkaron ne janata par jo jantar mantar kiya he, usase mukti kaa sthal jantar mantar hi ho saktaa he
 Democracy in India is alive as long as Jantar Mantar is alive
 tabhi to ye kisaan nange badan khuli sadak par let gaya he
 Farmers also get sleep
 teen chaar dinon se aise ram gaye hai jaise jantar mantar hi inkaa ghar ho
 This place is the farm for them
 kisaanon kii aatmahatya, sookhe kaa sankat ham sab cover karte hai
 There is nothing that the government does not know about, the journalist has not written
 kisaanon ko daam nahin mil rahe hai
 Sometimes compensation is received
 kabhi kabhaar karza maaf ho jaataa he
 But the crisis and drought returns every year or every other year
 maharashtra main barish se sookhe ne mukti pai to tamilnadu ko yah rog lag gaya
 Whenever someone commits suicide, it is added to the previous suicide
 106 kisaanon ne aatmahatya kii
 This farmer was 107th

 The problem of Kashmir is also like the problem of farmers

 The solution is none

 There is no language of our insensitivity

 This is the statement of Kaniza's mother who told Basharat Masood of the Indian Express how his only and very dear daughter Kaniza was killed

 How difficult it would be for a reporter to communicate with people in such times

 According to media reports, Tamil Nadu is in severe drought
 ham uttar bharatiyon ke liye to abhi garmi bhi nahin ai he magar dakshin ke hamaare priy rajya main sookhaa he
 The state government sought 39,565 crore help to deal with the drought
 ise aap package samajhate hai
 a drought has been declared in Tamil Nadu
 is saal northeast main barish 62 pratishat kam hui he
 This is the first time since 1876 there has been so little rain
 100 saal main pehali baar aisa sankat aayaa he phir bhi is sookhe kii daastaan aap tak laane ke liye kisi ko jantar mantar par nange badan khadey hona padataa he
 The water of Mettur Dam has reduced very much, the farmer can neither look towards the land nor look at the sky
 jantar mantar par jo kisaan aae hai unke paas bahut khet nahin hai
 All are small farmers
 inaki kuch maangen hai
 These farmers are going on hunger strike for 100 days
 inke paas hindi main ek parchaa he jis par sabase upar likhaa he, 'kisaan, jo raashtra ko ann dete hai, unki aatmahatya ko rokna
 Stop Tamil Nadu from becoming a desert
 kaveri nadi ko sookhne se rokna
 Constitution of Management Committee for Cauvery River
 krishi utpaadon ke liye uchit laabhadaayak mulya kaa nirdhaaran
 ' parche main yah bhi likhaa he, dukh ke saath bhukh hadtaal
 The name of the organization is South Indian Nadia Farmers Association
 hamaare liye to yah naam bhi nayaa he
 Nadia Farmers Association
 ye log nadiyon ko jodne kii maang karte hai
 In the morning Jantar Mantar came to show any support for these agitators
 unhone hamaare liye hindi main inaki samasya ko saamne rakhaa he
 Looking at the issue of farmers for so many days, one thing has been understood
 bharat ke kisaan laachaar nahin hai
 Farmers of India know how to make political decisions
 ve apane sankaton ke hisaab se raajnneetik faisla nahin karte hai balki puure samaaj ke liye faisla karte hai
 Otherwise farmers in many states do not vote for any political party
 jantar mantar par hi apane saamaan ke saath tamilnadu ke ye kisaan date hue hai
 Jantar Mantar is the real capital
 bharat kii samasyaon kaa ekmaatr pratinidhi sthal
 The Jantar Mantar that governments have imposed on the people, can only be the site of liberation from Jantar Mantar
 bharat main loktantr zindaa he jab tak jantar mantar zindaa he
 That is why this farmer lies on the bare open road
 kisaanon ko bhi neend aati he
 For three to four days, such rum has been lost as if it was Jantar Mantar
 ye jagah hi inke liye khet he
 Farmers suicide, drought crisis cover us all
 aisi koi baat nahin jiske bare main sarkaar ko na maaloom ho, patrkaar ne na likhaa ho
 The farmers are not getting the price
 kabhi kabhi muaavze mil jate hai
 Sometimes the loan gets forgiven
 lekin sankat or sookhaa har saal yaa har duusare saal laut aata he
 In Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu got the disease if the drought eradicated from the rains
 jab bhi koi suicide karata he, use pichhali suicide ke saath jod diya jaataa he
 106 farmers committed suicide
 yah kisaan 107waan tha
 Therefore, the suffering of the farmers is now beyond language
 jin logon ko bhashaa par bahut bharosa hota he unhen shuukravaar ke indian express ke pehle panne par chhapi bashaarat masood kii report padhani chahie
 The language of Kupwara of Kupwara in Kashmir was not even given a chance
 'maa kii bahon main so rahi thi

 The mother felt something sticky when she extended her hand towards the daughter

 Faizal's life is saved but due to being in the hospital, Kaniza could not even see for the last time

 Everyone knows the crisis

 What did Kaniza know
 
 
 
 a bullet is coming up to his bed
 itane dinon se kisaanon ke masale ko dekhte hue ek baat samaj ai he
 The farmers of India are not helpless
 bharat ke kisaan raajnneetik faisla karnaa jaanate hai
 They do not make political decisions according to their crises, but for the whole society
 varna kai rajyon main kisaan kisi raajnneetik dal ke liye vot hi nahin karte
 These farmers of Tamil Nadu are stuck with their belongings at Jantar Mantar itself
 jantar mantar hi asli rajdhani he
 The only representative site of India's problems
 sarkaron ne janata par jo jantar mantar kiya he, usase mukti kaa sthal jantar mantar hi ho saktaa he
 Democracy in India is alive as long as Jantar Mantar is alive
 tabhi to ye kisaan nange badan khuli sadak par let gaya he
 Farmers also get sleep
 teen chaar dinon se aise ram gaye hai jaise jantar mantar hi inkaa ghar ho
 This place is the farm for them
 kisaanon kii aatmahatya, sookhe kaa sankat ham sab cover karte hai
 There is nothing that the government does not know about, the journalist has not written
 kisaanon ko daam nahin mil rahe hai
 Sometimes compensation is received
 kabhi kabhaar karza maaf ho jaataa he
 But the crisis and drought returns every year or every other year
 maharashtra main barish se sookhe ne mukti pai to tamilnadu ko yah rog lag gaya
 Whenever someone commits suicide, it is added to the previous suicide
 106 kisaanon ne aatmahatya kii
 This farmer was 107th
 isliye kisaanon kii takaleef ab bhashaa ke paar he
 Those who have great faith in the language should read Basharat Masood's report printed on the front page of Friday's Indian Express
 kashmir ke kupwada kii kaniza ko to bhashaa ne uf karne tak kaa mauka nahin diya
 'sleeping in mother's arms
 bagal main uskaa bhai so rahaa tha
 a bullet arrived which silenced Kaniza
 maa ne jab apana haath beti kii taraf badhaayaa to kuch chipchipa sa mahasoos hua
 If i looked closely, the blood was spread on the bed
 kaniza is duniya se ja chuki thi
 Bullet was going on outside
 kaniza ke ghar ke paas main aatankwaadi chhipe the jinhen suraksha balon ne gher liya tha
 Whose gun shot was not known
 magar ek duusare ghar main so rahi kaniza ko maar gai
 His brother Faizal was also sleeping there
 ghayal ho gaya
 The policemen helped and Astpal was taken
 faisal kii jaan batch gai he magar aspataal main hone ke kaaran kaniza ko aakiri baar ke liye bhi nahin dekh paaya
 The problem of Kashmir is also like the problem of farmers
 sabko sankat maaloom he
 The solution is none
 ab unki takalif bhashaa ke paar ho chuki he
 There is no language of our insensitivity
 ham us goli kii tarah ho gaye hai jo ek baarah saal kii bacchee ko chupchaap maar kar, uske bistar ko lahooluhaan kar gaayab ho jate hai
 If there is any language for the suffering of Kaniza's mother, then tell it
 us bhashaa se puuchhiye ki neend main so rahi kaniza ne tab kya kaha tha, jab goli lagi thi
 His mother was sleeping there
 vahiin to uskaa bhai so rahaa tha
 The comments 'bahut pyaar karti thi kaniza ko
 i have four sons meri iklauti beti thi
 Sleeping with my head on my right hand
 achaakan usne jatke se saans lee
 When i put my hand on his body, it felt a bit sticky
 jab maine apni haathon ko dekha to koon se laal ho gaye the
 When i threw the blanket, i saw that there was blood all around
 uske or faijal ke badan se koon bah rahaa tha
 This is the statement of Kaniza's mother who told Basharat Masood of the Indian Express how his only and very dear daughter Kaniza was killed
 enditivi ke nazir masudi bhi kaniza ke ghar pahunche
 How difficult it would be for a reporter to communicate with people in such times
 andhera sa cameraa he
 Kaniza's brother is Kafzada
 bahan achaanak kahaan chali gai he ye unki samaj se baahar he
 13-year-old Aslam and 10-year-old Zafar all have eyes but their sister is not
 ghar dur tha magar goliyaan duuri tay kar leti hai
 This is the second incident within a week
 pulavama main bhi encounter kii goliyon kaa shikaar ek baccha ho gaya
 Was 15 years old, killed
 5 march ko sopor main suraksha balon ke camp ke nazadik visphot hone se chaar bachche ghayal ho gaye
 Everyone will have arguments
 kuch kashmir ke export honge
 There will be some hard statements
 in sabase goli apana rasta khoj leti he
 She changes the path chasing a terrorist
 kaniza ko kya pataa tha

 Farmers suicide, drought crisis cover us all
 aisi koi baat nahin jiske bare main sarkaar ko na maaloom ho, patrkaar ne na likhaa ho
 The farmers are not getting the price
 kabhi kabhi muaavze mil jate hai
 Sometimes the loan gets forgiven
 lekin sankat or sookhaa har saal yaa har duusare saal laut aata he
 In Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu got the disease if the drought eradicated from the rains
 jab bhi koi suicide karata he, use pichhali suicide ke saath jod diya jaataa he
 106 farmers committed suicide
 yah kisaan 107waan tha
 Therefore, the suffering of the farmers is now beyond language
 jin logon ko bhashaa par bahut bharosa hota he unhen shuukravaar ke indian express ke pehle panne par chhapi bashaarat masood kii report padhani chahie
 The language of Kupwara of Kupwara in Kashmir was not even given a chance

 ye sabhi ko maaloom he ki reliance jeeyo kii sevaayen ab muft nahin rahi

 is vajah se aisa ho rahaa he
 In Jio's Happy New Year offer, customers used to get 1GB in 4G speed every day for use

 In this regard, Jio's customer service officer said that the company has not yet fully migrated to the customers, due to which some customers are facing this problem
 haalanki company ne ye nahin bataaya ki is migration main company kitna vakt legi
 This has definitely shocked those customers who adopted a recharge pack of Rs 509 for the use of 2 GB data
 aise hi ek graahak kii shikaayat bhi khabar main ai thi, lekin baad main ye pareshaani dur ho gai thi

 Feroze Gandhi became MP when the first election was held after independence
 unke nidhan ke baad raibareli kaa netritv indira gandhi ne kiya
 When Indira was elected from Rae Bareli and became the Prime Minister of the country, she opened up a box of development for her parliamentary constituency
 ek ke baad ek kai audyogic ikaayiyon kaa udghaatan kiya
 NTPC is the largest industrial unit in the Rae Bareli region
 indira gandhi ne 1981 main uttar pradesh kii viddut pariyojna kaa udghaatan kiya tha
 Electricity production started here in 1988

 The explosion was so terrible that all the people jumped and bumped into the pipes of the power plant or got caught in them

 rahul gandhi kal hi gujarat ke teen din ke daure par pahunche the
 But on Thursday, he stopped his tour midway and headed straight to Rae Bareli

 This is not the first time of Rahul's visit to the victims after an accident, but the way he left Gujarat in the middle of the day and reached Rae Bareli before the incident took place 24 hours before the incident, the people watching his politics are surprised
 khaas baat ye he ki rahul ko raibareli se waapas gujarat aana tha kyonki vahaan chunaavon ke maddenjar unke kai ahm kaarykram the
 With Rahul showing such readiness to reach Rae Bareli, it is also being speculated that in future Lok Sabha elections he can contest from Rae Bareli instead of Amethi
 sonia gandhi jis tarah se biimaar hai
 It is believed that she will not contest the next election
 aise main raibareli kii seat par rahul utar sakate hai kyonki amethi main vaise hi smriti irani kii entry ne unki pakad kamjor kii he or 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main unki jeet kaa antar kaaphi kam rahaa tha

 They have been going on for generations, and mostly belong to the same caste society
 kisaan khet se gehun lekar aata he or mandi main rakh detaa he
 After that an employee arrives, sets the moisture content of the wheat and allows the inspector to buy the purchase
 kisaan ke us gehun ko taulne se lekar bore main bharne or trek main ladakar nigamon ke godaamon tak pahunchane kaa kaam aadhati kaa he
 For this, the adhatti has to pay a wage of six rupees for every fifty kilos of wheat sack
 badale main kharidne vaali agency aadhati ko dhai pratishat kaa kamishan detii he
 If the purchase price of wheat is Rs 1450 per quintal, then the agent gets Rs 35-36
 ab main yah nahin samaj sakaa ki yah dhai pratishat alag se aadhati ko miltaa he yaa wo genhu ko bore main bharne kii mazaduri or kamishan kaa paisa 1450 main se hi kaat letaa he
 The agent delivers the trucks to agencies
 kareed agenciyaan gehun kii quality kii jaanch karti hai or kami paae jane par 1450 rupee main se kuch hissaa kaat leti hai
 For this, the percentage of moisture content is broken and the percentage of grains broken
 yah itnaa jatil hota he ki aap algebra main paas ho jaayenge magar aadhati ke yahaan nahin
 Aadhati says that if he gave 1450 rupees to the farmers and the procurement agency paid less on the basis of quality then it would be lost
 vaise kisaan ko kabhi pataa hi nahin chalegaa ki uske gehun kii quality ko kis aadhaar par or kis maatra main kamazor bataakar paisa kaata gaya he
 Now it depends only on the integrity of the agent
 isliye mandi main aadhati kisaanon ko pakki parchi nahin detaa
 Whereas the adhatti should give a firm slip, which is called j form
 is raseed main gaanv or kisaan ke naam ke saath gehun kii kul keemat or rate likhaa hota he
 Giving a firm slip will mean paying full money
 kachi pakki dene kaa matlab he ki aadhati baad main kisaan kaa paisa kaat degaa ki aapke gehun kaa daam 1300 rupaya hi mila he
 The law should not give him a raw slip
 tab jab sarkaar ne kah diya he ki sab gehun kharida jayega
 Such news comes in the media but not everyone is bought on the ground
 koun sa gehun kharida jayega iske liye niyamon kii tamaam paraten tay hoti hai
 At a glance, if we remove this job, many problems will be eliminated
 jab mandi he, vahaan kisaan ko aakar anaaj bechnaa he or kharidne ke liye sarkari agency he to sthaayee or jatigat aadhaar par ye agent kyon hai
 There is another side to it
 aadhati shoshan kaa kaaran ho saktaa he to yahi musiibat main kisaanon kaa saathi bhi he
 Farmers say that the bankers get the land mortgaged for lending
 kaagazi karrwai main hi kaaphi vakt nikal jaataa he jabaki aadhati vishwaas ke aadhaar par karz de detaa he
 When the farmer has additional money, he invests with the agent only because the agent pays more interest than the bank
 kisaan aadhati se naaraaz ho saktaa he magar uske kilaaf khulaa vidroh nahin karegaa kyonki wo ek chakra main fansaa he
 The farmers said that they borrow more from the bank than the agent
 bank to zamin ke badale kheti ke liye lone detaa he, personal lone nahin detaa
 Arrati also gives personal loans
 aadhati se sirf paisa aasaani se miltaa he lekin vasuuli ke niyam behad sakht hai
 The rate of interest is much higher than banks
 itnaa hi nahin, ek kisaan ne bataaya ki agar do lakh rupee karj liya he to ek saath chukaana hoga
 If you pay half, then you will get another two and a half percent interest on the entire amount of the borrower loan
 is tarah se sood mul se zyada ho jaataa he
 When the country's leaders say that they will free the farmers from the moneylenders, they do not speak the whole truth
 unhen pataa hota he ki sahuukaar koun he
 They are the moneylender whose members are very big leaders in these parties
 isliye aadhati khatm hoga to kisaan or khatm hoga magar aadhati rahegaa to kisaan khatm hoga hi
 You should keep reading this line carefully and understand that when we take a loan for a house, on the basis of salary, you get a loan of up to thirty five lakh for a house of fifty lakhs
 hamaari naukari bhi pakki nahin he
 Can go anytime
 lekin kisaan karz lene jayega to pehle ek karod kii apni zamin bainkon ke paas girvee rakhega phir use dhai lakh kaa lone milegaa
 This is what a farmer told me today
 mujhe bank se jo lone milegaa wo das yaa bees saal ke liye milegaa kisaan ko zyada se zyada chah maheene ke liye lone miltaa he
 As soon as the grain falls in the mandi and the check of the payment is received, the farmers get a call to repay the loan first
 tippaniyan Now in this situation, our banks do not torture the farmers any less than the moneylenders
 phir bhi kisaan credit card ne unhen kai prakaar kii suvidhaayen di hai lekin kisaan ek aise chakra main fansaa he jisase wo nikal hi nahin saktaa
 It does not come out even when the weather is not bad
 fark itnaa hota he ki ek ummid ban jaati he ki uske achche din aa gaye hai
 Actually, good days of farmers do not come
 behatar he tivi band kiijie or mandiyon main jaaiye
 There you will find out how the farmer God has been relied upon
 mandiyon main unke baithne kii vyavastha dekh aaiye
 Shame on you raaton ko paharaa dene ke liye koi chaukeedaar nahin hota
 There is no police
 kisaan raatbhar jagakar apane anaaj kii chaukeedaari karata he
 This is when looking at the TV channels, it seems that our leaders must be working for the farmers
 vikaas kaa vikalp koun sa vikaas he ye koi nahin bataata balki uski jagah kaarykushalta or mobile phone ke eps ko nayaa vikaas bataa detaa he
 Therefore our understanding of all political debates is not clear that if this is not development then what is other development
 hamaari kheti ek gambhir sankat se guzar rahi he
 Has been going through many years
 centre se lekar rajya sarkaar tak koi apane kaam kaa hisaab nahin detaa ki hamane ye kiya or kheti ko sankat se ubaar liya
 They say Congress and Congress says BJP
 koi saath saal kii duhai detaa he to koi pandrah saal kisi rajya main sarkaar chalaakar bhi nahin bataa paa rahaa he ki hamane iskaa samaadhaan kiya he
 So even this debate gives us no special understanding except that people are happy to see the parties of their choice winning the debate
 sansad main netaaon ke bhaashan kii sanjidagi kaa imtahaan lenaa ho to aap kisi mandi main chale jaaiye
 i cannot say the mandis of other states but have seen the mandis of Uttar Pradesh and Haryana
 maharashtra kii mandi dekhi he kaaphi hitech kism kii lekin vahaan bhi to kisaan aatmahatya kar rahaa he
 Yet if there is so much pressure on the Prime Minister about the farmers that they are speaking in Parliament in a sad tone, then why is there no such pressure on the ministers, officers and employees of the states
 ab main aadhati, bank, mandi or kisaan system kaa network samajhaata hum
 i do not claim that my understanding is complete but i want to keep it as raw as you have understood
 rajya sarkarein apane nigamon ke zariye mandiyon se anaaj kharidti hai
 There is an intermediary between the farmer and these corporations that we call agents and agents
 ye aadhati pidiyon se chale aa rahe hai or zyaadaatar ek hi jatigat samaaj se sambandh rakhte hai
 The farmer brings wheat from the field and keeps it in the market
 uske baad ek karmchaaree aata he to gehun kii nami kii maatra tay karata he or parchez inspector ko kareedne kii anumati de detaa he
 From weighing the wheat of the farmer to filling it into sacks and loading it in trucks, it is the job of transporting it to the godowns of corporations
 iske liye aadhati ko har pachaas kilo gehun kii bori par chah rupee kii mazaduri deni padati he
 In return, the buying agency pays a commission of 2
5 percent to the agent
 agar 1450 rupee prati quintal gehun kaa kareed mulya he to usamen aadhati ko 35-36 rupee milte hai
 Now i could not understand that it gets two and a half percent separately to the adhati or he deducts the labor and commission money from the 1450 in the wheat sack
 aadhati trakon se agenciyon ke paas pahunchaa detaa he
 The buying agencies check the quality of the wheat and deduct a portion of the Rs 1450 if found to be deficient
 iske liye nami kii maatra se lekar toote hue daanon kii maatra kaa pratishat tay hota he
 It is so complicated that you will pass in Algebra but not in the faction
 aadhati kahata he ki agar usne kisaanon ko 1450 rupee de diye or kharid agency ne quality ke aadhaar par kam bhugtan kiya to uskaa nuksaan ho jayega
 However, the farmer will never know that on what basis and in what quantity his wheat quality is weakened and money is cut
 ab yah aadhati kii eemaandaaree par hi nirbhar karata he
 Hence, the agent in the mandi does not give a firm slip to the farmers
 jabaki aadhati ko pakki parchi deni chahie jise je form kehete hai
 In this receipt, the total price and rate of wheat is written with the name of the village and the farmer
 pakki parchi dene kaa matlab puraa paisa dena hoga
 Giving raw pulp means that the agent will cut the money of the farmer later that the price of your wheat has got only 1300 rupees
 kanuunan use kachi parchi nahin deni chahie
 Then when the government has said that all wheat will be purchased
 media main aisi khabaren aati hai magar zamin par sab nahin karidaa jaataa
 All the layers of rules are fixed for which wheat will be purchased
 ek nazar main ham is aadhati ko hataa den to bahut si samasya khatm ho jaaegi
 When the mandi is there, the farmer has to come and sell the grain and there is a government agency to buy, so why are these agents on permanent and caste basis
 iskaa doosraa paksh or bhi he
 If the exploitation can be the reason for exploitation, then it is also the partner of farmers in trouble
 kisaan kehete hai ki bank vaale karz dene ke liye zamin girvee par rakhwa lete hai
 a lot of time is left in paperwork while the agent gives loan on the basis of faith
 jab kisaan ke paas atirikt paisa hota he to wo aadhati ke yahaan hi nivesh karata he kyonki aadhati bank se zyaada byaaz detaa he
 The farmer may be angry with the agent but will not revolt against him because he is trapped in a cycle
 kisaanon ne kaha ki ve bank se zyada aadhati se karza lete hai
 The bank gives loans for agriculture, not personal loans, instead of land
 aadhati personal lone bhi detaa he
 The money is easily available from the agent, but the rules of recovery are very strict
 byaaz dar bainkon se bahut zyaada he
 Not only this, a farmer said that if a loan of two lakh rupees is taken, then it will have to be repaid simultaneously
 aadha chukaayenge to aadhati karz kii puri raashi par alag se dhai pratishat or byaaz le legaa
 In this way Sood becomes more than the original
 jab desh ke netaa kehete hai ki sahukaaron se kisaanon ko mukt karaayenge to puraa sach nahin bolte
 They know who the moneylender is
 aadhati hi wo sahuukaar hai jiske kai sadsy inhen partiyon main bade bade netaa hote hai
 Therefore, if the method is finished then the farmer will end, but if the method continues, the farmer will end
 aap is pankti ko dhyaan se padhate rahiye or yah samajhiye ki jab ham ek makaan ke liye lone lete hai to selary ke aadhaar par pachaas lakh ke makaan ke liye pantis lakh tak kaa lone mil jaataa he
 Our job is also not confirmed
 kabhi bhi ja sakati he
 But if the farmer goes for a loan, first he will pledge one crore of his land with the banks and then he will get a loan of 2
5 lakh
 ek kisaan ne aaj mujhe yahi bataaya
 The loan that i will get from the bank will be available for ten or twenty years, the farmer gets a loan for at least six months
 mandi main anaaj girte hi or bhugtan kaa check milte hi kisaanon ko phone aane lagata he ki pehle lone chukaayiye
 The comments ab is sthiti main hamaare bank bhi kisaanon ke saath sahukaaron se kam atyaachaar nahin karte hai
 Even then the Kisan Credit Card has given him many facilities but the farmer is stuck in a cycle from which he cannot get out
 mausam karaab nahin hone par bhi wo nahin nikal paata he
 The difference is that one hopes that good days have come
 darasal kisaanon ke achche din aate hi nahin he
 It is better to turn off the TV and go to the mandis
 vahaan pataa chalegaa ki kaise kisaan bhagwaan bharose chhod diya gaya he
 Look at their seating arrangement in the mandis
 aapako shame aegi
 There is no watchman to guard the nights
 police nahin hoti
 The farmer awakens throughout the night and guards his grain
 yah sab tab he jab tivi channelon ko dekhakar aisa lagata he ki hamaare netaa kisaanon ke liye kitna kaam kar rahe honge
 Our farming is going through a serious crisis
 pichley kai saalon se guzar rahi he
 No one, from the Center to the state government, gives an account of their work that we have done this and got the agriculture out of the crisis
 wo kehete hai congress or congress kahati he bijepi
 If someone asks for sixty years, then even after running a government in a state for fifteen years, he is unable to tell that we have resolved it
 lihaaza is bahes se bhi hamen koi vishesh samaj nahin milti he sivaay iske ki log apni apni pasand kii partiyon ko bahes main jitate dekh khush ho lete hai
 If you want to test the seriousness of the speech of the leaders in Parliament, then you go to some market
 main anya rajyon kii mandiyon kii baat nahin kah saktaa lekin uttar pradesh or haryana kii mandiyaan dekhi hai
 Mandi in Maharashtra has seen a lot of high-tech type, but even there, the farmer is committing suicide
 phir bhi agar kisaanon ko lekar pradhanmantri par itnaa dabaav he ki ve udhaas swar main sansad main bol rahe hai to rajyon ke mantriyon, afasaron or karmchaariyon par vaisaa dabaav kyon nahin he
 Now i explain the network of Aadhati, Bank, Mandi and Kisan systems
 main daawa nahin karata ki meri samaj puri he par jitna kaccha pakkaa samajha he wo aapke saamne rakhana chahta hum
 State governments, through their corporations, buy food grains from mandis
 kisaan or in nigamon ke bich ek madhyasth hota he jise ham agent or aadhati kehete hai
 They have been going on for generations, and mostly belong to the same caste society
 kisaan khet se gehun lekar aata he or mandi main rakh detaa he
 After that an employee arrives, sets the moisture content of the wheat and allows the inspector to buy the purchase
 kisaan ke us gehun ko taulne se lekar bore main bharne or trek main ladakar nigamon ke godaamon tak pahunchane kaa kaam aadhati kaa he
 For this, the adhatti has to pay a wage of six rupees for every fifty kilos of wheat sack
 badale main kharidne vaali agency aadhati ko dhai pratishat kaa kamishan detii he
 If the purchase price of wheat is Rs 1450 per quintal, then the agent gets Rs 35-36
 ab main yah nahin samaj sakaa ki yah dhai pratishat alag se aadhati ko miltaa he yaa wo genhu ko bore main bharne kii mazaduri or kamishan kaa paisa 1450 main se hi kaat letaa he
 The agent delivers the trucks to agencies
 kareed agenciyaan gehun kii quality kii jaanch karti hai or kami paae jane par 1450 rupee main se kuch hissaa kaat leti hai
 For this, the percentage of moisture content is broken and the percentage of grains broken

 When the farmer has additional money, he invests with the agent only because the agent pays more interest than the bank
 kisaan aadhati se naaraaz ho saktaa he magar uske kilaaf khulaa vidroh nahin karegaa kyonki wo ek chakra main fansaa he
 The farmers said that they borrow more from the bank than the agent
 bank to zamin ke badale kheti ke liye lone detaa he, personal lone nahin detaa
 Arrati also gives personal loans
 aadhati se sirf paisa aasaani se miltaa he lekin vasuuli ke niyam behad sakht hai
 The rate of interest is much higher than banks
 itnaa hi nahin, ek kisaan ne bataaya ki agar do lakh rupee karj liya he to ek saath chukaana hoga
 If you pay half, then you will get another two and a half percent interest on the entire amount of the borrower loan
 is tarah se sood mul se zyada ho jaataa he
 When the country's leaders say that they will free the farmers from the moneylenders, they do not speak the whole truth
 unhen pataa hota he ki sahuukaar koun he
 They are the moneylender whose members are very big leaders in these parties
 isliye aadhati khatm hoga to kisaan or khatm hoga magar aadhati rahegaa to kisaan khatm hoga hi
 You should keep reading this line carefully and understand that when we take a loan for a house, on the basis of salary, you get a loan of up to thirty five lakh for a house of fifty lakhs
 hamaari naukari bhi pakki nahin he
 Can go anytime
 lekin kisaan karz lene jayega to pehle ek karod kii apni zamin bainkon ke paas girvee rakhega phir use dhai lakh kaa lone milegaa
 This is what a farmer told me today
 mujhe bank se jo lone milegaa wo das yaa bees saal ke liye milegaa kisaan ko zyada se zyada chah maheene ke liye lone miltaa he
 As soon as the grain falls in the mandi and the check of the payment is received, the farmers get a call to repay the loan first
 tippaniyan Now in this situation, our banks do not torture the farmers any less than the moneylenders
 phir bhi kisaan credit card ne unhen kai prakaar kii suvidhaayen di hai lekin kisaan ek aise chakra main fansaa he jisase wo nikal hi nahin saktaa
 It does not come out even when the weather is not bad
 fark itnaa hota he ki ek ummid ban jaati he ki uske achche din aa gaye hai
 Actually, good days of farmers do not come
 behatar he tivi band kiijie or mandiyon main jaaiye
 There you will find out how the farmer God has been relied upon
 mandiyon main unke baithne kii vyavastha dekh aaiye
 Shame on you raaton ko paharaa dene ke liye koi chaukeedaar nahin hota
 There is no police
 kisaan raatbhar jagakar apane anaaj kii chaukeedaari karata he
 This is when looking at the TV channels, it seems that our leaders must be working for the farmers
 isliye mandi main aadhati kisaanon ko pakki parchi nahin detaa
 Whereas the adhatti should give a firm slip, which is called j form
 is raseed main gaanv or kisaan ke naam ke saath gehun kii kul keemat or rate likhaa hota he
 Giving a firm slip will mean paying full money
 kachi pakki dene kaa matlab he ki aadhati baad main kisaan kaa paisa kaat degaa ki aapke gehun kaa daam 1300 rupaya hi mila he
 The law should not give him a raw slip
 tab jab sarkaar ne kah diya he ki sab gehun kharida jayega
 Such news comes in the media but not everyone is bought on the ground
 koun sa gehun kharida jayega iske liye niyamon kii tamaam paraten tay hoti hai
 At a glance, if we remove this job, many problems will be eliminated
 jab mandi he, vahaan kisaan ko aakar anaaj bechnaa he or kharidne ke liye sarkari agency he to sthaayee or jatigat aadhaar par ye agent kyon hai
 There is another side to it
 aadhati shoshan kaa kaaran ho saktaa he to yahi musiibat main kisaanon kaa saathi bhi he
 Farmers say that the bankers get the land mortgaged for lending
 kaagazi karrwai main hi kaaphi vakt nikal jaataa he jabaki aadhati vishwaas ke aadhaar par karz de detaa he

 This is what a farmer told me today
 mujhe bank se jo lone milegaa wo das yaa bees saal ke liye milegaa kisaan ko zyada se zyada chah maheene ke liye lone miltaa he
 As soon as the grain falls in the mandi and the check of the payment is received, the farmers get a call to repay the loan first
 tippaniyan Now in this situation, our banks do not torture the farmers any less than the moneylenders
 phir bhi kisaan credit card ne unhen kai prakaar kii suvidhaayen di hai lekin kisaan ek aise chakra main fansaa he jisase wo nikal hi nahin saktaa
 It does not come out even when the weather is not bad
 fark itnaa hota he ki ek ummid ban jaati he ki uske achche din aa gaye hai
 Actually, good days of farmers do not come
 behatar he tivi band kiijie or mandiyon main jaaiye
 There you will find out how the farmer God has been relied upon
 mandiyon main unke baithne kii vyavastha dekh aaiye
 Shame on you raaton ko paharaa dene ke liye koi chaukeedaar nahin hota
 There is no police
 kisaan raatbhar jagakar apane anaaj kii chaukeedaari karata he
 This is when looking at the TV channels, it seems that our leaders must be working for the farmers
 ek nazar main ham is aadhati ko hataa den to bahut si samasya khatm ho jaaegi
 When the mandi is there, the farmer has to come and sell the grain and there is a government agency to buy, so why are these agents on permanent and caste basis
 iskaa doosraa paksh or bhi he
 If the exploitation can be the reason for exploitation, then it is also the partner of farmers in trouble
 kisaan kehete hai ki bank vaale karz dene ke liye zamin girvee par rakhwa lete hai
 a lot of time is left in paperwork while the agent gives loan on the basis of faith
 jab kisaan ke paas atirikt paisa hota he to wo aadhati ke yahaan hi nivesh karata he kyonki aadhati bank se zyaada byaaz detaa he
 The farmer may be angry with the agent but will not revolt against him because he is trapped in a cycle
 kisaanon ne kaha ki ve bank se zyada aadhati se karza lete hai
 The bank gives loans for agriculture, not personal loans, instead of land
 aadhati personal lone bhi detaa he
 The money is easily available from the agent, but the rules of recovery are very strict
 byaaz dar bainkon se bahut zyaada he
 Not only this, a farmer said that if a loan of two lakh rupees is taken, then it will have to be repaid simultaneously
 aadha chukaayenge to aadhati karz kii puri raashi par alag se dhai pratishat or byaaz le legaa
 In this way Sood becomes more than the original
 jab desh ke netaa kehete hai ki sahukaaron se kisaanon ko mukt karaayenge to puraa sach nahin bolte
 They know who the moneylender is
 aadhati hi wo sahuukaar hai jiske kai sadsy inhen partiyon main bade bade netaa hote hai
 Therefore, if the method is finished then the farmer will end, but if the method continues, the farmer will end
 aap is pankti ko dhyaan se padhate rahiye or yah samajhiye ki jab ham ek makaan ke liye lone lete hai to selary ke aadhaar par pachaas lakh ke makaan ke liye pantis lakh tak kaa lone mil jaataa he
 Our job is also not confirmed
 kabhi bhi ja sakati he
 But if the farmer goes for a loan, first he will pledge one crore of his land with the banks and then he will get a loan of 2
5 lakh
 ek kisaan ne aaj mujhe yahi bataaya
 The loan that i will get from the bank will be available for ten or twenty years, the farmer gets a loan for at least six months
 mandi main anaaj girte hi or bhugtan kaa check milte hi kisaanon ko phone aane lagata he ki pehle lone chukaayiye
 The comments ab is sthiti main hamaare bank bhi kisaanon ke saath sahukaaron se kam atyaachaar nahin karte hai
 Even then the Kisan Credit Card has given him many facilities but the farmer is stuck in a cycle from which he cannot get out
 mausam karaab nahin hone par bhi wo nahin nikal paata he
 The difference is that one hopes that good days have come
 darasal kisaanon ke achche din aate hi nahin he
 It is better to turn off the TV and go to the mandis
 vahaan pataa chalegaa ki kaise kisaan bhagwaan bharose chhod diya gaya he
 Look at their seating arrangement in the mandis
 aapako shame aegi
 There is no watchman to guard the nights
 police nahin hoti
 The farmer awakens throughout the night and guards his grain
 yah sab tab he jab tivi channelon ko dekhakar aisa lagata he ki hamaare netaa kisaanon ke liye kitna kaam kar rahe honge

 aadhati shoshan kaa kaaran ho saktaa he to yahi musiibat main kisaanon kaa saathi bhi he

 Dozens of vehicles are stuck on both sides of the highway

 The Meteorological Department had predicted heavy rains for two days on Saturday itself
 aise main logon ko aakasmik baadh or bhaskhalan se bhi sachet rahane ko kaha gaya tha
 Due to intermittent rains for the last few days, the soil has become wet and soft and additional rains are expected to cause landslides, accidental floods and mud subsidence which may lead to closure of highways and local roads

 While the party's internal differences in the bjp's two-day national executive in Goa have become known, the party is trying to calm the disputes by saying that all is well
 party logon ko 'ol ij wel' kaa sandesh dena chaahati he
 On Saturday, party spokesperson Prakash Javadekar tried to explain at the press conference that there was no division in the party
 prakaash jaavdekar ne ek ore jahaan congress ko kosa, vahiin bijepi ko desh kaa hit kar sakane vaali party bataaya
 On the issue of the alleged illness of LK Advani, he said that he is really sick
 saath hi party kii ore se liye jane vaale kisi bade faisle (sambhavat: modi ko lekar) par samvaadadaataaon se kal (ravivaar) tak intjaar karne ko kaha
 Javadekar said that Rajnath Singh has said that the present Congress government has created a crisis in the country
 congress kaa 9 saal kaa reportcard vifaltaa kaa card he or usapar se janata kaa bharosa uth chukaa he
 'advani fell ill due to changing weather' Prakash Javadekar said in a press conference on Saturday that Advani ji is really ill
 doctor ne unhen aaraam karne kii salaah di he
 For this reason, they will only rest for the next 3-4 days
 jaavdekar ne kaha ki rajnath singh ne bhi adwani ko tanaav na lene kii salaah di he
 Javadekar told that Advani has given best wishes to BJP workers
 jab prakaash jaavdekar se adwani kii beemaari ke bare main poocha gaya to unhone kaha ki yah mausam badalane kii vajah se he, koi badi beemaari nahin he
 Javadekar said that Advani has been his guide and will always be
 'hamane bharaa gilaas diya tha'bijepi adhyaksh rajnath singh ke bhaashan kii charchaa karte hue jaavdekar ne kahaaki bijepi ne congress ko bharaa hua gilaas diya tha
 Then the country's growth rate of 8

 BJP got development, Congress destroyed it

 The development of our country depends on the policies here
 piem ne naitikta ko rakhaa taak parabijepi ne koyala ghotaale ko lekar ek baar phir piem manmohan singh ko gheraa
 Javadekar said that the PM did not have the right to continue in his post after the Supreme Court's comment on changing the coal scam report
 yadi vah bane rahete hai to yah naitikta ko taak par rakhane jaisaa he
 BJP is fighting for change of system, Javadekar said that the fight of BJP is not only power but also for change of system
 bijepi shasit rajyon main sushasan he
 Actually, the basis of the model of development should be Swadeshi and Sarvodaya
 congress ke bijli muhaiyaa karne ke vaayade ko jhootha bataate hue jaavdekar ne kaha ki atomi deal se kuch nahin hua
 The government should apologize for this
 mulaayam singh yadav ne bhi is deal kaa samarthan kiya tha, isliye unhen bhi maafee maangani chahie
 Uttar Pradesh is immersed in darkness
 bijepi main dikhne lagi mahafoot2014 ke liye mahamanthan karne gai bijepi main mahafoot dikhaai de rahi he
 Many big leaders of BJP, including Advani, have not reached the national executive meeting
 haalanki bijepi sabaki alag-alag vajah bataa rahi he, lekin har koi jaanata he ki bina aag ke kabhi dhuaan nahin uthta
 For the Mission 2014, the BJP started the mahamanthan, but without Advani
 party sutron ke mutabik adwani modi ke naam par naaraaz the, isliye baithak main nahin pahunche or hawala diya kharaab sehat kaa
 However, till a day before, BJP was claiming Advani at the meeting
 khud party adhyaksh rajnath singh ne bhi kaha tha ki adwani aaenge, lekin matbhed itane bade ho gaye, daraaren itani bad gayi ki adwani ne rashtriya kaaryakarini kii baithak se kinaaraa kar liya
 Many Diggbat did not arrive, did not end with Advani's displeasure
 rashtriya kaaryakarini kii baithak ke shuru hone se pehle hi kai party netaaon ke naa aane kii khabar aa chuki thi
 Leaders like Maneka Gandhi, BC Khanduri, Yashwant Sinha did not attend the meeting
 isse pehle hi jaswant singh or uma bharti jaise netaa bhi rashtriya kaaryakarini kii baithak se kinaaraa kar chuke hai
 Though everyone cited poor health, Yashwant Sinha showed his gesture against Modi in gestures and clearly said that he has not had 'namo' Niya
 ab tak saaf ho chukaa tha ki modi ke naam par bijepi bant chuki he, lekin party kii taraf se lagaataar ye kaha jaataa rahaa ki koi kalah nahin he, koi manmutav nahin he
 Whereas, Alam is that now Team Advani's attitude has become tough
 udhar, rashtriya kaaryakarini ke andarkhaane se bhi bijepi alaakaman ke tikhe tewaron kii baat saamne aane lagi he
 It has been said that the high command is very angry with the rebellious remarks of big party leaders
 sutron ke mutabik, yahaan tak tay kiya ja chukaa he ki adwani ke bina hi ab modi kaa naam aage badhaayaa jayega
 That is, in the name of Modi, the Mahabharata is set in the BJP
 padhein sambandhit khabaren-in 10 vajahon se kabhi piem nahin ban sakate modimishan 2014 ke liye modi ke naam par lagegaa thappa!bjp ke paas modi hi he vikalpasinghal or ramdev ne kiya modi kaa gungangova adhiveshan: kya he bijepi kaa game plan?'modi se BJP biimaar, to desh kaa kya hoga' Questions have been raised in Australia after Sachin Tendulkar was awarded the Order of Australia
 australia ke fedral independent empi rob okshot ne kaha he ki australian pradhanmantri julia gilard ne bharat ke saath kootnithik sambadh behatar karne ke liye ye kadam uthaaya he
 According to Oakshott, he is not opposed to Sachin, but such a great respect of the country should not be used for politics in this way

 The voters of India have voted in favor of good governance rather than strong leadership, jobs instead of governmental favor and policy of appeasing and wooing India's diverse communities
 ye sabhi vikalp modinomics ke loklubhaavan naare or bhrashtachar mukt pragatisheel bharat ke vaade ke rath par savaar rahe hai
 This trend of choosing the ability to show some tax was also revealed in May 2013, when the electorate of Pakistan elected a new government and, like India, chose Nawaz Sharif, more favorable for development, by rejecting the Pakistan People's Party
 kul milakar yah is kshetra ke liye acha shagun he ki matadaata samajhadaar ho rahaa he or ateet se kati hui yuva aabaadi behatar jindagi paane ko betaab he
 India's inclination towards right wing is also no different from Pakistan
 2013 ke chunaav main jiti pakistan muslim lig navaj or purv cricketer imran khan ke netritv main ubhari duusari sabase badi party kaa duniya kaa najariya bhi dakshinpanthi he
 Now both countries have to deal with the issue of minorities
 pakistan main maamuli-si gaiyr-muslim aabaadi or shiya alpsankhyak aabaadi par hamale ho rahe hai
 India's parliament has the lowest number of Muslim mps after the 2014 election
 raajnneeti or dharm kii is jabardast pahchaan se ek shatabdi pehle shuru hui rajnatik prakriya kii pariniti vahaan hui, jahaan raajnneeti main dharm kaa samavesh hua or aasthaa rajnatik vichaardhaara kaa ek ang ban gai
 Therefore, many people in Pakistan, especially the right wing elements, are silently celebrating Modi's election as Prime Minister
 modi hindutv kii dein hone ke saath-saath uskaa aadhunik cheharaa bhi hai
 This justifies the existence of Pakistan
 sachaai bhale hi is saral vyakhya se bahut dur ho, lekin dharanaon ko hawa dene or unka phayda uthaane kii hi kala kaa naam raajnneeti he
 For example, Hafiz Mohammad Saeed of jamaat-ud-dawa, the leading anti-india voice in Pakistan, said that the bjp's victory in the election of India "has exposed the pole of Indian secularism"
 ’’ham main se bahut-se log apane bad or thode tede padosi ke saath adhik saamaanya or paripakv sambandh chaahate hai
 While cautioning such people, Saeed said that friendship (as if present) can no longer be continued
 said jaise bahut se logon kaa maananaa he ki bharat main chunaav pakistan or islam virdohi bhaawanaaon par ladaa gaya
 Although this is an exaggeration, the kind of treatment Modi has treated the small Muslim minority of Gujarat gives strength to such ideas in the Pakistani public opinion
 dakshin se hatakar madhya ke raste par aaen to sansad kii raksha samiti ke adhyaksh seenetter mushahid hossain jaise ashaavadi adhik utsahit hai
 Giving an opinion on the Indian election, he said that Modi will be governed by his economic agenda and hope that Atal Bihari Vajpayee will take inspiration from his style of work
 pakistan ke adhiktar vishleshak or rajnatik dal bhi shaayad yahi maanate hai
 The initiative taken by Prime Minister Vajpayee to come to Pakistan by bus and to make a special effort to visit the monument of the 1940 Lahore resolution has an indelible mark on the relations between the two countries
 sharif or parvej musharraf donon ne vaajapeyi ke saath sambandh rakhe the or is kshetra ke saath samvaad rakhane kaa unka nicksan jaisaa najariya bharat ke nae pradhanmantri ke liye aisi viraasat he, jise desh kii videsh niti banaate samay yaad rakhana phydemand sabit hoga
 Pakistan's relationship with the new government depends on which path Modi takes in the country
 agar modi aarthik vruddhi, vyapaar or sampannataa ke apane bahut se vaade puure karne vaale hai to is kshetra main shanti bharat ke sabase adhik hit main hogi
 On the contrary, Pakistan should be bothered if the way to show the much publicized but excessive nationalism and masculinity exists everywhere
 jaankaron ne pakistan kii taraf ranneetik drushti se berukhi apnaane kii salaah di hogi
 Nevertheless, it is very important for the new government to formulate a Pakistan policy
 ab tak yah niti aatanki ghatnaon par jaldbaaj pratikriya se lekar puraani peedi ke rajanetaaon kii khatti-mithi yaadon se jude apanepan ke bich jhulati rahi he
 The media-driven public's memory of the 26 November Mumbai attacks still dominates the general public opinion
 aisa nahin he ki is ghatana ko bhula diya janaa chahie, kyonki aatank kii koi bhi ghatana asweekaarya he, lekin rajanyik vikalpon ko simit karnaa, khaskar us desh ke liye katai aklmandi nahin he, jo kshetreey netritv kii aakanksha rakhata ho
 If the signs of the Indian media are true, then Modi is going to change the foreign and security policies of the country
 agar ve bijepi ke ghoshnaa patr ko sarkaar kii nitiyon main shaamil karne kii bhi koshish karne vaale hai, to bharat-paak sambandhon main jabardast hode kaa daur shuru hone vaala he
 It will first appear in Afghanistan
 bahut-se logon ko dar he ki agar donon desh samvaad ke mahatv se inkaar karte rahe, to bharat or pakistan ke bich chhadam yuddh or tej ho saktaa he
 Aggressive people sitting in Delhi may pressurize Modi to adopt an aggressive policy of responding to the disproportionate display of power from Pakistan
 aisa hua, to pakistan, khaskar uske suraksha pratishthan ke tevar bhi or garam ho jaaenge
 We hope that such a situation will not arise
 pakistan ke ranneetik vichaarkon main se ek varg ko chintaa he ki bijepi ne hameshaa bhartiya sena main nivesh kiya he or use aadhunik banane kii koshish kii he
 This will also alert Pakistanis
 bhartiya sena kii pakistan kii parmaanu shakti ke daayre se neeche paaramparik yuddh jari rakhane kii niti kaa pakistan pehle se hi jawaab de rahaa he
 When the leaders of both countries are showing dreams of development, jobs and bullet trains, both arms race is not needed
 bharat or pakistan ke sambandhon ko naukarshahi ke jaal or sena ke guna-bhaag, donon se mukt karne kii jarurat he or unhen aapasi aarthik sahyog par adhik dhyaan dena chahie, jisase dhire-dhire vishwaas paidaa ho sake
 Will Modi be willing to choose this path? Only time will tell
 pakistan ke pradhanmantri ne modi ko badhai di he or apane yahaan aane kaa nyauta diya he
 Many people in the country's administrative establishment believe that Pakistan can work with Modi
 aisi khabaren bhi hai ki haal ke maheenon main parde ke peeche sampark hue hai
 But when India's security establishment, some sections of the media and BJP workers see Pakistan only from the perspective of terrorism, will Modi want to have a better relationship with it? The bigger question is to what extent will the bjp's ideology impact power behavior and policy making? Whatever path Modi and his colleagues choose, they should remember this soulful poem by Vajpayee, "now there is no war Will give ’’ dosti bhale hi koson dur ho, lekin bharat or pakistan kii janata ko apane netaaon se paripakv samvaad kii apeksha karne kaa haq to jarur he
 In Pakistan, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif is slowly but steadily trying to take policy towards India
 donon paksh vaicharik str par chaahe jo bhi rukh apanaaen, parde ke peeche samvaad sahit aapasi rajnay jari rahanaa chahie
 Modi's rise in India is full of possibilities
 unke tarkash main sochi-samajhi pakistani niti honi chahie or pakistan kii asainik sarkaar ke saath baatcheet faldaayi hogi
 Taking inspiration from the meeting of the Director General of Military Operations in December last year, the interaction between the army should also be better
 pakistan main is baat par aam sahmati he ki rishte saamaanya hon or vyapaar bade
 The challenge for the BJP government may be to find better ways to change the policy and reshape mutual relations
 (raza rumi da friday times pakistan ke salaahkaar sampadak or dilli bai hart impreshans of a pakistani traveler ke lekhak hai) Shocking Bollywood filmmaker Subhash Ghai, the Bombay High Court has ordered him to return the land allotted to him for his ambitious film institute 'whistling Woods International'
 tippaniyan While awarding the verdict on a PIL, the court said that the land was illegally allotted
 court ne ghai ko nirdesh diya ki vah unke kabje main open land ke rup main maujuud film skool ke liye aavantit kii gai 14
 Return 5 acres of land immediately to the government, and 5 in the possession of the studio and film institute
 5 acre jameen 31 july, 2014 tak lautaaen
 Court from Ghai from the year 2000 to 5
 3 karod rupee salanaa ke hisaab se kiraaya dene ke liye bhi kaha he
 The decision is considered a cause of shame for Union Science and Technology Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh, as the land was allotted to filmcity in Goregaon in the name of opening a film institute under a joint venture with Ghai during his chief ministership
 
 ek janhit yachika par faisla sunaate hue court ne kaha ki zamin gaiyrkanoonee tareeke se aavantit kii gai
 The court directed Ghai to allot 14 to the film school in his possession as open land

 gujarat chunaav ke liye voting puri hone ke saath hi agsit pole ke nattejey saamne aa gaye
 These results have brought the news of bad news for the newly elected Congress President Rahul Gandhi
 maheenon kii ji tod mehnat or sadhe jaateey samikarnon ke baavjood congress eczit pole ke mutabik himachal main satta ganvaa rahi he jabaki gujarat main bhi uski siton main koi khaas ijapha nahin dikh rahaa
 The preparations and attitude with which Rahul landed in the Gujarat elections before becoming president was unprecedented
 unka aatmavishvaas badha hua saaf nazar aa rahaa tha
 This new avatar also reinforces his new responsibility as Congress President
 lekin adhyaksh ke rup main unke naam kii ghoshnaa ke ek saptaah baad hi gujarat or himachal ke vidhansabha chunaav parinaam aa rahe hai or agar agsit pole ke nattejey sach sabit hue to rahul ko kuch tikhe sawaalon ke jawaab dene honge
 How to avoid the responsibility of defeat? Rahul's critics say that only and only defeat has been settled throughout his political career
 wo jahaan bhi prachaar karne gaye, party harati rahi
 But due to his mother Sonia Gandhi holding the post of Congress president, the defeat of Rahul in the presence of the Congress party was also considered defeat
 ab, jabaki wo party adhyaksh ban gaye hai or ek bahari chehre ke bajaay gujarat main logon ke bich rache-based nazar aa rahe the, gujarat or himachal chunaav main congress kaa haarana sidhe taur par unki haar maani jaaegi
 Critics will say that even if you give the command, party and all rights to Rahul, he is destined to lose luck
 ye bhi padhein
 
 
 The most important thing in the Gujarat elections that will decide on the improvement in victory and defeat, then why share it? Rahul is undoubtedly appearing in a new avatar
 unke bare main logon ke bich dharna tezi se badalati mahasoos ho rahi he
 Rahul's confidence seems to be better and his speaking, answering things, his appearance is also improving
 pehali baar rahul ek paripakv netaa kii tarah dikhaai de rahe hai
 Even the opposition cannot forget to consider them as mrigachauna
 lekin gujarat kii haar unpar haas-parihaas ke tikhe hamale phir se karne kaa mauka khol degi
 An improvement in Rahul's image needs a clear proof right now, but according to exit polls he does not seem to get this proof in the Gujarat elections
 nae senapati main kaise bharosa karenge kshatrap?rahul ke liye gujarat jeetna isliye bhi zaruri he kyonki unki apni party main unhen gambhirtha se liya jaae, iske liye aavashyak he ki wo khud ko sabit kar paaen
 Rahul does not seem to cross the Congress party's strength in Gujarat even with full force
 aise main ve kis aadhaar par baaki rajyon main apane party ke chehron se jeet kii guarantee kaa vachan lenge
 In the coming days elections will be held in states like Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh
 vahaan bhi party ke nae netaa ubhar rahe hai
 Rahul could ask for a guarantee of victory only if he showed it himself
 lekin agsit pole ke mutabik unhen naakaami mil rahi he

 rahul se bhi zyaada piem modi ke liye nirnaayak he gujarat kaa janadeshparty main kaise rokenge virdohi awaajen?congress party main ek badi taadaad aise netaaon kii he jo rahul style raajnneeti main dhire-dhire haashie par dhakel die jaaenge or kam praasangik rah jaaenge
 In such a situation, if the results of Gujarat remain as per the exit poll, then these leaders will give vent to discontent within the party
 gutbazi or sonia lao, congress bachaao jaise naare bhi die ja sakate hai
 Even the discouragement of the worker at the lower level in the party can be very heavy in terms of saving the organization and rebuilding it
 rahul ko is vakt apane kaaryakartaaon main utsaah bhi bharna he or rahul virdohi tatwon kaa munh bhi band karana he
 Gujarat's win could have been helpful in this, but regret does not appear to be happening
 vipaksh kis aadhaar par maanegaa netaa?gujarat chunaav ke thik baad kaa puraa ek saal yani 2018 agle aam chunaav ke liye desh main raajnneeti khadi karne kaa vakt he
 At this time only Rahul's victory could bring him as an option for those dissatisfied with the opposition and Modi
 lekin agsit pole ke nattejey bataate he ki aisa hone nahin ja rahaa
 Now the opposition will refuse to see possibilities in Rahul and the divided opposition will miss out on a comprehensive strategy against Modi
 ye bhi padhein
 
 
 Five reasons, why it is important for Congress President Rahul Gandhi to win Gujarat in order to be an alternative to the politics of Modi and BJP in the next general election and to lead it, it was necessary that Rahul should win these elections
 gujarat main unki jeet ek bada sandesh lekar jaati jiskaa asar aagaamee vidhansabha chunaavon main bhi dikhataa or rashtriya raajnneeti par bhi
 Rahul's increased power could have given him the ability to operate any major opposition platform
 agar agsit pole ke nattejey sach sabit hue to rahul ye sunaharaa mauka kho denge
 You will remember Pooja Mishra who spoke 'spare Me' in Bigg Boss-5
 ab ve 'baaja baja duungaa' main item song kar rahi hai
 In the conversation with him, he talked a lot about his career from Bigg Boss
 pesh he unase baatcheet ke pramukh ansh:item song karne kaa kaise man banaaya?yah movie maine big bos se pehle sin kii thi
 It contains my item song
 yah isliye kiya, kyonki aajkal film main yaa to lead role myne rakhata he yaa phir item sang
 It is not inferior in any sense
 isamen aap boldnes kaa khub chhaunk laga rahi hai?aisa nahin he, isamen jaraa-si bhi chip-ness nahin he
 Its wording is also not like this
 jahaan tak dress kii baat he to unhone jo dress mujhe pahanane ke liye kahi, vah maine pahanane se manaa kar kii
 He said that i should arrange the dress myself
 maine dress dizin kii, or maine use pahana to sab dekhte rah gaye
 Is there anything to say about the kind of arrogance that is going on in Bigg Boss? Bigg Boss show is contrived by nature itself
 yah sho isliye chalata he kyonki star ke bare main jitna dikhnaa chahie, usase zyada dikhataa he
 But the definition of violence in the house should be redefined, because i was forced out of the house at two o'clock in the night only to speak of violence
 maine to kuch kiya bhi nahin tha
 Did you say anything about Big Boss-6's Imam Siddiqui? Yes, he stole my style
 sabase pehle time out shabd kaa istemaal maine kiya tha
 Now they are also doing a show with this name
 maine hi joker geoup bhi liya, jise imam ne navras main istemaal kiya tha
 You can check my video blogs to confirm all this, the whole thing will be understood
 suna he, is sijan main aapako laane kii baat chal rahi he?sho shuru hone se pehle mujhase baat hui thi, lekin ab koi baat nahin hui he
 Anyway, i am busy with many of my commitments

 Bollywood stars Amitabh Bachchan termed Mumbai's "shanti" as "terrible" on the nationwide shutdown organized by opposition parties today to protest the rise in prices of petroleum products and inflation, while Bipasha Basu asked Whether this shutdown can solve anything
 hindi film jagat ke mahanayake amitabh bachchan ne micro bloging website twitor par likhaa, ‘‘bharat band, insaan band, saans band, aashaa band or niraashaa band
 
 
 Mumbai is much quieter this morning
 yah kitna bhayanak he
 "bollywood Bala Bipasa Basu, famous for his glamorous style, tweeted," Prices of essential commodities are rising dangerously
 aam aadmi dwaara banaai gai sarkaar ko chaiye ki ab vah unke liye kaam karnaa shuru kare
 But can the India bandh solve anything? ”opposition NDA and Left parties have organized a nationwide bandh today in protest against the increase in petroleum prices and inflation
 aam aadmi party (aap) ke bhrashtachar virdohi yoddha arvind kejariwal ke utthan se na keval bharat ke rashtriya raajnneetik dal dare hue hai, balki jammu evam kashmir main kuch algaavvaadi netaaon main bhi unka bhay bana hua he
 They are afraid that this party will probably make an impact in the state
 yah baat algaavvaadi netaaon main se ek mohammad yaccin malik kii ore se jari bayaan se spasht he
 After aap's resounding victory in Delhi, Yasin, the leader of Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front, was the first person who gave AAP the title of 'anti-kashmir' party
 yahi nahin jab aap netaa prashanth bhushan ne aabaadi vaale kshetron main sashastr balon kii maujuudagi ke bare main janamat sangrah karaane kaa suzav diya to malik ne unhen bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ke aadmi kii oopaadhi di
 At the same time, the BJP called him an agent of separatists
 sirf yaccin malik hi nahin, balki saiyad ali shah gilaani ne bhi bhushan par nishaanaa saadhaa
 It is very interesting to see why separatist leaders of Jammu and Kashmir AAP are scared of the party
 in algaavvaadi netaaon ko unke bhrasht aacharan yaa mukhyadhara ke dalon dwaara banaai jagah ke chalate samaaj ke vimukh virgon ne hameshaa hi darkinar kiya he
 In such a situation, due to aap's emergence and its national influence, a debate has started on its entry into the politics of the state of Jammu and Kashmir
 yahi kaaran he ki jab kuch buddhijiviyon or naagarik samaaj samoohon ne jammu evam kashmir main vikalp ke rup main aap par charchaa shuru kii to algaavvaadi netaa khiz uthe
 Even Chief Minister Omar Abdullah seems to be in awe of the party's popularity and its charm in Jammu and Kashmir
 supreme court ne medical corces ke liye saajha pravesh pariksha yojit karne ke prastaav ko manjuuri de di he
 The Court has rejected its own decision in 2013 on the Common Entrance Test for MBBS, BDS and postgraduate medical courses

 During the hearing on the review petition of the National Eligibility Entrance Test (NEET), the Supreme Court said that NEET can be implemented until the validity of the Common Entrance Test is renewed
 court ne 2013 main medical corces ke liye saajha pravesh pariksha ko avaidh qaraar dete hue kaha tha kiemasiaiko nijee medical collejon par kaaman entrens test (siiti) lagu karne kaa adhikaar nahin he

 Let us know that the way of power of the country goes through UP and to win UP it is necessary to win the eastern region
 isi formule sebijapi2014 ke loksabhaa or 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav main upi se sabase zyada siten hasil kar satta main virajman hui thi
 Now in order to win the war of 2019, we have again set our eyes on the mission Purvanchal
 purvanchal ko saadhane ke lihaaj se piem modi do divasiy daure par somvaar ko kaashi pahunche
 During this time, his parliamentary constituency, Varanasi was presented with the gift of development projects worth 500 crores
 isamen electrical kaam (bijli ) old kaashi 36200 lakh, 33 in tu 11 kevi vidyut sab stesan betower -279 lakh, atal incubeshan centre 2000 lakh, nagepur gram peyajal yojana -275 lakh, 33 in tu 11 vidyut sab stesan kurusato nirmaa -260 lakh kaa locarpan shaamil he
 Narendra Modi wiped out the opposition in 2014 Lok Sabha elections from Varanasi
 unhone upi ke varanasi se bihar tak ke chunavi nateezon par asar daalaa tha
 Azamgarh was the only seat in Purvanchal where the BJP could not win
 baaki purvanchal kii sabhi loksabhaa siten bijepi ke khate main gai thim
 In the 2017 assembly elections, the BJP adopted the same strategy and PM Narendra Modi demolished the opposition by staying in Varanasi for the last three days of the election campaign
 ab ek baar phir modi ne 2019 fatah karne ke liye kaashi ko apana rankshetra banane kii kavayad shuru kar di he
 Significantly, to prevent Modi from coming to power, opposition parties are coming together in UP
 purvanchal ke gorakhpur or phulpur loksabhaa upachunaav main sapa-basapa kii ekta se bijepi chaaron khaane chit ho gai thi
 After this, the opposition's strength of unity was also seen in Kairana in western UP, where RLD defeated BJP
 upachunaav main mili jeet ke formule se utsahit sapa, basapa or congress 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav menmahagathbandhanabanaakar utarane kaa man bana rahe hai
 The churning continues with the seat sharing between the three parties
 sapa adhyaksh akhilesh yadav to bijepi ko rokane ke liye har samjhauta karne ko taiyaar he
 In Aaj Tak's Mind Rocks program, he had said that in 2019 we will do everything possible to stop the BJP and we are ready if two steps have to be taken back for the seat agreement
 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main vipaksh mahagathbandhan banaakar utarataa he, to bijepi ke liye 2014 jaise nattejey doharaana aasaan nahin hoga
 If you leave the Lok Sabha seat like Kashi, then most of the seats of Purvanchal can get out of bjp's hands
 bijepi ke haathon se purvanchal khiskaa to phir desh kii satta tak pahunchnaa mushkil ho jayega
 It is very important for the BJP to practice Purvanchal under the political temperament instead of UP
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki piem modi kaashi main apana janmdiwas manaane ke liye majaboor hona padaa he
 BJP is focusing more on Eastern Uttar Pradesh than Western Uttar Pradesh
 piem modi ne purvanchal main mishan-2019 kaa tanabana kaashi se bunane kaa aagaaj kar diya he
 Earlier, the foundation of the Purvanchal Expressway, the biggest project of the Uttar Pradesh government in Mulayam's citadel Azamgarh, was laid
 ye desh kaa sabase bada express-ve hoga
 The Purvanchal Expressway will also be connected with the Link Express Way in Gorakhpur, Allahabad and Bundelkhand
 gujarat ke patidaar samudaay ke liye aarakshan kii maang kar sukhiryon main aae nae patel netaa hardik patel jati ko pradhanta dete hai
 In Aajtak's program Sidhi Baat, he said directly that he casts votes only after seeing caste
 apni jati kaa jo acha netaa he, vahi unke liye sabase sahi he
 Not only this, he rejected the Modi model of Gujarat and said, 'there is no Gujarat model of development
 'exclusive baatcheet menhardikne pradhanmantri modi par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha, 'modi ke gujarat main amir or amir hue, garib or garib
 There is no Gujarat model of development
 maine apane gaanv main vikaas kaa koi model nahin dekha
 However, 22-year-old Hardik also said that it is not his goal to oppose anyone
 vah haq kii baat kar rahe hai or unke parivaar ke logon ne bhi narendra modi ko vot diya he
 It is interesting that the castes will be united
 On the one hand, while Hardik wants to be like him by claiming that he is a descendant of Sardar Patel, on the other hand, he talks about unifying the caste, apart from the anti-caste policy of Sardar Patel
 patel aarakshan ke masale par hardik patel kehete hai, 'chunaav main hamaari jati ke log khadey hone chahie
 The caste will be united only then the country will be united
 gujarat main 1 karod 80 lakh patel hai, lekin unamem se 5-10 fisadi hi rais he
 This does not mean that the entire community has become rich

 The farmers are committing suicide
 padhe-likhe logon ko naukari nahin mil rahi
 My grandfather owned 40 acres, i have 5 acres
 jameen bechakar flats kharidne ko vikaas nahin kehete hai
 "I am a fearless leader, but afraid of elections" Hardik Patel, who believes in responding to violence with violence, does not consider himself a leader from anywhere
 vah kehete hai, '27 karod patel mere saath hai
 Patels from all over the country are with me
 lekin main netaa nahin hum
 i am a fearless leader
 ' PAAS ke sanyojak hardik patel kisi tarah kirajnneetik mahatvakankshaase inkaar karte hai
 He talks about never contesting elections in future and says that he is afraid of elections
 58 ho netaaon ke ritairement kii umrayuvaaon ko raajnneeti main aage laane ke liye hardik patel unke ritairement kii umr 58 saal karne kii baat karte hai
 Advocating a young man to be Prime Minister, he says, "leaders who are older than 58 years should retire
" pradhanmantri koi yuva bane
 Hardik, an admirer of Shiv Sena founder Bal Thackeray, believes that if the blueprint of Delhi's Arvind Kejriwal's development had passed, Bal Thackeray would surely succeed
 'budtamiji karne vaale kaa haath kaat denge'hardik patel ne ahmedabad main beete dinon aarakshan ke liye raily ke dauraan hui hinsa ke liye police ko jimmedaar mana he
 He says, 'violence was committed by the police
 ' jab unase poocha gaya ki sadakon par pradarshnakariyon ne bhi to todphod kii, hardik ne jawaab diya, 'agar koi budtamiji karegaa ko bardaasht nahin karenge
 Will cut off the hands of abusers with their mothers and sisters
 'photo khinchane kaa matlab samarthan nahindesh ke hindu bigrade or modi virdohi ko apana saathi maanane se inkaar karte huehardikne kaha ki vah aisi kisi raajnneeti kaa hissaa nahin hai
 He said, 'the photo is with whom i am not necessarily associated with them

 i do not even know them
 'hardik kehete hai ki unke aasapaas jo bhi log hai, wo haq kii ladaai ke liye hai
 He says, 'I want to be Sardar, not Modi

 i will raise my voice whenever there is injustice

 shahar ke chandrasekhar aaazaad agriculture uniwarsity or kanpur uniwarsity main paanch agast ko pradesh ke udyog mantri pehle charan main kuch chaatro ko laptop vitarit karenge, baaki chaatro ko baad main laptop diye jaaenge
 According to a statement issued by the district administration, there are plans to distribute laptops to 28 thousand 500 students of the city who have passed the 12th examination in 2012
 pradesh ke udyog evam niryaat protsaahan mantri bhagavat sharan gangavar paanch agast ko sabase pehle kanpur uniwarsity main yojit samaaroh main 12veen paas 890 chaatr-chaatraon ko laptop kaa vitaran karenge

 50-year-old Shailendra Sethi of Kanpur runs a defense equipment manufacturing unit in Panki Industrial Area
 apni adhiktam kshamta se chalane ke liye is ikai ko rojaanaa 10,000 unit bijli kii jarurat hoti he, lekin roj 6 se 8 ghante kii katautee se utpaadan ko gaharaa jhtka laga he
 The factory was able to get only 6,000 units of electricity in June 2012
 sethi kehete hai, ''hamaara kaarobaar har maheene 10 lakh ru
 Is but four lakhs last month due to deduction
 kaa nuksaan ho gaya he
 "sethi is not alone in making such a complaint, this is the cry of the industrialists, businessmen and common people of the country
" garmi ke lanbaa khinchate chale jane or monsoon ke der se aane ke kaaran deshbhar main bijli kaa sankat gaharaa gaya he
 The Union Energy Ministry may be claiming that the demand and supply gap has been reduced due to the increase in energy capacity in the Eleventh Plan (2007-08 to 2011-12), but the situation has worsened at the ground level
 desh ke lagbhag sabhi hisson main lambii katautee ke kaaran log ab sadakon par utarane ko majaboor ho gaye hai
 The Ministry of Power, for instance, claims that 56,816 MW capacity was added in the Eleventh Five Year Plan, but due to coal supply and irrational charges, the plants remain idle or produce much below their capacity
 yahi nahin, kangaal vitaran companiyon ke paas bijli kharidne ke liye sansaadhan nahin he
 They either get subsidy from the government or they are forced to take loans from the bank to buy electricity
 uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ne apni purvavarti mayawati sarkaar par mahangi daron par bijli kharidkar upi power korporation ko 25,000 karod ru
 Is accused of causing harm
 unhone 4 july ko lakhanu main kaha, ''bank ab korporation ko karj dene se inkaar kar rahe hai
 “aggregate Transmission and Commercial (AT&C) losses are 27 per cent on average across the country
 isaki vajah se samasya bad gai he
 The power shortage is also different in different areas
 *bihar main may ke dauraan adhiktam 22
 There was a shortfall of 1 percent, while Himachal Pradesh had 11 in June
 6 fisadi kii kami thi
 * Tamil Nadu needs 12,500 MW daily, but only 8,500 MW is being produced there
 1995 ke baad rajya main koi nayaa power plant shuru nahin hua
 During the last seven years, the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board has increased its capacity to 333 MW but the demand has increased to 3,791 MW
 *assam main bijli kii kul kami saamaanya avadhi main 107 megawatt he jabaki zyada khapat vaale samay main yah 273 megawatt ho jaati he
 It needs 1,100 MW of power daily
 sarkari aankadon ke mutabik, assam ko centre se 751 megawatt bijli milti he or 408 megawatt rajya main paidaa hoti he
 Shyamakanu Mahanta, consultant in hydropower projects, admits, "two of the state's three large units lag behind their performance
 namrup thermal 58 fisadi kshamta par chal rahaa he jabaki lakva thermal 75 fisadi kshamta par
 According to the Mahant, the only way is that the state prefers its projects more
 *bihar main rojaanaa 3,000 megawatt kii jarurat he lekin yahaan 1,800 megawatt kii kami he
 The biggest reason for this is that there is no electricity generation in the state, due to that 40% power loss is lost in distribution
 *andhra pradesh main ausat salanaa panbizli utpaadan pichley das saal ke dauraan 577

 baharhaal, yahaan bijli kii haalat sudhari he
 In 2002, the distribution work was handed over to Reliance's BSES and Tata Power's DDL when 50% power was lost in the transmission itself
 10 saal baad yah 15 fisadi par aa gaya he, jo rashtriya ausat se kam he
 As of May 31 of this year, India had a total power generation capacity of 2,02,979 MW of which thermal plants i
e
 coal, gas and diesel based plants accounted for 66
 3 fisadi he
 Despite the indo-us nuclear treaty, the share of nuclear power is still a total of 2
 4 fisadi he
 The first unit of the Kudankulam plant in Tamil Nadu, which is delayed due to the protests, will generate 100 MW of power daily
 mana ja rahaa he ki yah agast, 2012 se shuru ho jayega
 Ashok Khurana, director general of the Association of Power Producers, says, "at least 50 per cent of the plants set up in the Eleventh Plan have increased our capacity to 56,816 MW, but they are working below their capacity because of fuel shortage Are coming in '' sarkari bijli sansthaanon kaa kul ghaataa kareeb do lakh karod ru
 They have reached and they also have such a small periodic loan, so they do not have the money to buy electricity
 kai rajyon main bijli kii killat ke saath hi ab doshaaropan shuru ho gaya he
 The Ministry of Power is blaming the Ministry of Coal and Petroleum for the lack of fuel supply and blaming the distribution companies of the state for the losses in distribution
 koyala mantralay badale main paryaavaran evam van mantralay ke sir par topi pahana rahaa he ki usne utkhanan kii raah main roda daalaa hua he
 The recent coal block scandal has made the Ministry of Coal almost inept - no new coal linkages have been approved since April 2010
 paryaavaran or van mantralay kii sakriyatawadi nitiyon ke chalate baari panbizli kshamta vaale uttarakhand jaise rajya main koi atirikt kshamta paidaa nahin ho saki he kyonki tehri baandh kaa virodh abhi thama nahin he
 a similar policy is being adopted in the case of the northeastern states as well, due to which it is still far-fetched to set up plants there practically
 yojana ayog ke sadsy or buniyadi dhaancha visheshgy gajendra haldiya bataate hai, ''2003 ke bijli kanoon ke chalate utpaadan, transmishan or vitaran ke maamle main nitiyon ko ab bazaar aadhaarit hona hoga
 But the distribution is still with the state monopoly companies
 jahaan kahin pratispardhaa ko manjuuri mili he, samasyaayein kam hui hai
 "state governments fear privatization of distribution companies as they fear that the entry of the private sector will increase the electricity tariff and cause anger among the people
" sachai bhi yahi he ki bijli aapurti main sabase kamjor kadi vitaran hi he
 The State Electricity Boards (sebs) have been in a dilemma since the fifties
 yojana ayog ne 2011-12 kii apni report main kaha tha, ''venkataraman cameti ne 1964 main kaha tha ki unke (esaibi ke) nivesh par munafa kaaphi kam he
 Despite this, the committee also said that one of the reasons for this is the burden on the electricity boards of the responsibility of electrification of rural areas where both expenditure and deficit are high
 '' maano yahi kaaphi nahin tha, so uttar pradesh ke chunaav se pehle samaajawaadee party ne kisaanon or bunakaron ko rojaanaa 18 ghante muft bijli kaa vaada kar daalaa
 The same work was done by Shiromani Akali Dal in Punjab and Anna DMK in Tamil Nadu

 "the gas-based 5,000 to 6,000 MW capacity is still to be approved, it has been stopped due to lack of gas," says an energy ministry official
 ''iske kaaran koyala mantralay or kol india limited kii chhavi kharaab hui he or unke liye kaam karnaa mushkil ho rahaa he
 "in every scheme, the energy sector has grown by eight to nine per cent, while CIL has been running negatively during the last three years," says the Energy Ministry official
 urja mantralay ke anumaanon ke mutabik in sanyantron ko adhiktam kshamta par chalaane ke liye kam-se-kam 50 karod ton koyala jaruri he

 Ramasubhamanian, Rohit Parihar, Amitabh Srivastava and Shravya Jain dilli vidhansabha ke vishesh satr ke pehle dinmukhyamantri arvind kejarivalpar mirchi atake par jamkar charchaa hui
 Delhi government minister Satyendra Jain expressed concern over the deteriorating law and order situation of Delhi and demanded a resolution from the central government to subdue the Delhi Police under the Delhi government
 vahiin, dilli ke siem ne kaha he ki agar piem modi dilli ke siem ko suraksha nahin de sakate to unhen istipha de dena chahie
 CM Arvind Kejriwal said in the Delhi Assembly that the Delhi Police is an institution and the police should protect their honor
 aam aadmi party vidhayakon ne siem par ho rahe hamalon or uske baad dilli police kii ore se koi karrwai na kiye jane ke masale ko sadan main uthaaya
 The AAP mlas told the House that the Rs 1 crore Samman Rashi scheme given to the Delhi Police in the event of martyrdom should be scrapped, but the CM disagreed with the demand of the mlas
 siem ne kaha ki un par jo hamale ho rahe hai or uske baad police kaa jo ravaiya he, uske liye dilli police ko dosha dena thik nahin he, balki in sabake peeche bijepi kii gandi raajnneeti he
 Kejriwal said that the BJP is making the Delhi Police a pawn, but the Delhi Police should respect the martyrdom of its comrades
 kejariwal ne kaha ki ve hameshaa dilli police ke saath rahenge, lekin modi kabhi police waalon ke saath nahin honge
 Kejriwal said that out of the 18 martyrs who have been martyred on duty, Rs 1 crore is being given the honor amount, 11 are Delhi Police soldiers
 kejariwal ne kaha ki dilli police ko chuni hui sarkaar ke daayre main aana chahie taaki dilli kii kanoon-vyavastha ko thik kiya ja sake or police sarkaar ke prati javabdeh ho
 He said that before the AAP government in Delhi, schools, hospitals were in bad shape and people used to curse teachers and doctors, but today they are the same teachers and doctors, due to which the situation has changed
 kejariwal ne kaha ki agar dilli police bhi sarkaar ke daayre main ho to yahi pulicekarmi dilli ke logon kii raksha karenge
 The CM said that he has been attacked four times in the last three years and not even a charge sheet was filed in a single case
 kejariwal ne kaha, "sawaal yah he ki ye hamale kyon hue? dilli kii logon ne yah gustaakhee kar di ki unhone ek aam aadmi ko siem bana diya or yahi kaaran he ki bijepi ab dilli ke logon se badla le rahi he
 These attacks of BJP are directly on the people of Delhi
 chaaron hamale bijepi ne dilli kii janata par karwaae hai
 "kejriwal said that after the recent attack in the Delhi Secretariat, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh called him and he told the Home Minister that either the Center has a hand in these attacks or the Center is in protecting the CM of Delhi
 Have failed
 siem ne kaha ki dilli kii police sidhe centre ke adheen he or agar piem modi dilli ke siem ko suraksha nahin de sakate to piem ko istipha de dena chahie
 The BJP high command's decision to support Jitan Ram Manjhi came in the wake of the mood of party mlas
 sutron ke mutabik kal raat party netaa susheel kumaar modi ke ghar vidhayak dal kii ratribhoj par hui baithak main vidhayakon se mili pratikriya ne party alaakaman ko chaunkaa diya
 At the same time, Jeetan Ram Manjhi said this morning that he has sought support from mlas and not from the party
 bihar bijepi main adhikansh vidhayakon kii raay thi ki bijepi ko vishwasamat ke dauraan maanjhi ke paksh main vot dena chahie na ki walk out karnaa chahie jaisaa party alaakaman soch rahaa he
 BJP mlas said in unison that they are coming back from their respective constituencies
 har jagah mahadaliton main nitish kumaar ke prati rosh he
 He is angry that Nitish is insulting a Mahadalit leader Jitan Ram Manjhi
 vidhayakon ke mutabik ye poocha ja rahaa he ki agar maanjhi ko is tarah apamaanit karke hataanaa tha to phir unhen nitish kumaar ne mukhyamantri banaaya hi kyon? He is the same Mahadalit who endorsed Nitish Kumar in the last Lok Sabha election
 bijepi ke kai netaa kehete hue mil jaaenge ki kai matdaan kendron par lambii-lambii kataron or ghanton intjaar karne ke baad mahadalit samudaay ne janata dal united ke paksh main ek tarafa matdaan kiya tha
 BJP strategists do not consider this analysis to be true that by supporting Manjhi, the upper caste votes of the BJP will be shattered by it
 wo poochhate hai ki aakhir maanjhi ne pichley nau maheenon main aisa kya kar diya jo oonchi jatiyon ke khilaaf jaataa ho
 One or two of his statements have gone against the upper castes, but there is no point in opposing Manjhi on the basis of statements alone

 bihar ke upmukhyamantri susheel kumaar modi or purv upmukhyamantri tejasvi prasad yadav bhrashtachar or benami sampatti ke mudde ko lekar shuukravaar ko aamane-saamne aa gaye
 Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader and former Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Prasad Yadav accused Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi of making black money white through his brother's companies, while Sunil Modi also gave a clarification on Tejashwi at the age of 26 Accusing him of owning benami properties, he sought his answer

 " He said that Lalu Prasad should tell how Rabri Devi became the owner of 18 flats? How did Tejashwi Yadav become the owner of 26 benami properties at the age of 26? He said that if Lalu Prasad wishes, i can come to his house and tell him about all his income and his sources

 If you take a quick look at the equation of this seat, the TDP has had a heavy upper hand in the Lok Sabha elections held here, as TDP has won 7 times from this seat while the Congress party has won only 3 times
 bijepi bhi yahaan pair pasaarne kii koshish kar rahi he
 The Congress had a one-sided rule in the Chittoor Lok Sabha constituency
 is baat kaa andaja isi baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki is seat se sabase zyada 11 aam chunaavon main congress ne jeet kaa paracham laharaaya he
 However, after the TDP came into existence in 1982, the Congress suffered a rapid collapse and in the 9 general elections held after 1982, the Congress could win only twice, while 7 times the seat went to the TDP
 1982 main tidipi ke gathan ke baad 1984 main aam chunaav hue jisamen tidipi ke sansthaapak anti ramarao kii aandhi main yah seat bhi congress ke haanthon se nikal gai
 However, in 1989, the Congress returned once again and won the seat in 1991, but the Congress victory ceased here and the TDP has consistently held this seat in the six general elections that followed

 His entire journey from the son of a tea shopkeeper to the country's most powerful Prime Minister has been filled with shocking stories and events that have shaped his personality
 uttari gujarat ke vadnagar railway stesan par ek choti-si chaay kii dukaan ke maalik damodaradaas modi ke ghar 1950 main janme narendra teen kamaron ke chote-se ghar main chah bhai-bahanon ke saath paley-bade
 During his childhood, Narendra Modi used to return from school to help his father at his shop and often used to take tea in the kettle to the customers
 vadnagar ke shri bi
 N
 hyskool main modi gyarahavin tak padhe
 There he was considered a brilliant student
 aashcharya nahin ki ve apni kaksha main sabase achche vaktaa the or skool ke naatakon main hissaa liya karte the
 Once he also played the role of Maharaja of Bhavnagar
 ve shiksha ke itar gatividhiyon main sakriy rahete the or ensisi ke ek kushal cadet bhi the
 "he was really multi-faceted," says his classmate Sudhir Joshi, who lives in Vadnagar
 ’’ unke anya sahpaathee nagaji desai, jinke saath modi kaaphi samay bitaayaa karte the, kehete hai, ‘‘ve skool main jo kuch bhi karte the, usamen awwal rahete the
 "modi came to the RSS branch in 1965 at the age of 15 under the influence of RSS leader Babubhai Nayak
" iske kuch dinon baad hi unhone swami vivekanand ko padhuya shuru kar diya, jinaki shakhsiyat or upadeshon ke ve mureed ho gaye the
 Apart from this, he was also influenced by the views of two local Sarvodayi leaders Dwarkadas Joshi and Rasiklal Parikh
 itani sari preranaon kaa hi asar rahaa ki unke bheetar aresas ke sikhaye prakhar rashtrawaad or sarvoday andolan kaa gandhivaad donon kaa mishran panpa
 The five years since he was 17 were quite turbulent and it was perhaps that part of his life that made the most profound impact on his personality
 jab ve bamushkil 18 baras ke the, tab unke mata-pita ne unki ichha ke virudv unke hi ghanchi (taili) samudaay kii ladki jashodaben se modi kii shaadi karvaa di
 On the one hand, the ideology of RSS and Sarvodaya was propelling Modi towards public service and on the other hand domestic responsibilities had come in the form of a husband
 yuva modi is dotarafa dabaav ko jhel paane main kaaphi dikkat mahasoos kar rahe the
 After all, he regretted his wife that he was not strong enough to take this decision first and then left home for three months and went to solitude in the Himalayas
 vahaan se ve ghar nahin laute, balki ahmedabad main apana sthaayee thikaana bana liya
 Minor Initiation In the late 1960s in the largest city of Gujarat, Modi started working as a supervisor in the canteen of Gujarat State Transport Corporation
 yahi vah samay tha jab aresas ke saath ve kareeb se jude or unhen sthaneey vishwa hindu parishad ikai kaa prabhaar saunpa gaya
 The credit for bringing him closer to the RSS in Ahmedabad goes to a person named Ambalal Koshti, who still works in the Gujarat BJP headquarters
 1970 ke dashak kii shuruyaat main aresas main kaam karte hue modi kaa sampark us shaks se baduya shuru hua jiskaa unke jivan par shaayad sabase gaharaa prabhaav he-aresas ke prachaarak lakshmanarav inaamdaar
 The story of how Modi became his confidant is very interesting
 inaamdaar ne uttari gujarat ke ek sudur ilaake main aresas ke ek teen divasiy shivi ke dauraan modi ko 50,000 ru
 Handled a bundle of
 modi ko yah samaj main nahin aayaa ki is nakadi ko kaise sambhala jaae
 Then they dug a pit at the place where RSS leaders used to sit during the day
 unhone paison kii potli vahiin gaad di
 On the fourth day in the morning, when Modi took out money from the pit in the presence of Inamdar, he was shocked
 ve inaamdaar hi the jinhone 22 baras kii umr main modi ko prachaarak banaaya, jiske baad modi ne apni padhai-likhaai dobaaraa shuru kii or phir duurastha shiksha ke madhyam se bie or eme kii padhai puri kii
 Khichdi and kadhi used to be Modi's permanent meals
 unki khaane ko lekar khaas pasand-naapsand kabhi nahin hua karti thi, haalanki apane kapadon, juuton or baaki saamaan ko lekar ve hameshaa sachet rahete the
 Even when he lived at the RSS headquarters in Kankaria area of ahmedabad, his dress was still a matter of discussion among fellow campaigners, who are taught to live a simple life
 ek prachaarak ke taur par kaam karte hue unhen unke chaahane vaale fansy sandels, sundar kurte ore aakarshak ghadibhan diya karte the
 Obviously, these things could not be hidden and there used to be a lot of whisper behind it
 us daur ke ek prachaarak ne bataaya, ‘‘modi paakhandee nahin the
 He did not lead a garish life, but his life was undoubtedly better than the life of an ordinary preacher
 ve anaavashyak kam kharch main nahin, balki sahajata main yakeen rakhte the
 "another anecdote of those days shows his cool nature and a different perspective from the rest of the campaigners
" aresas ke ek prachaarak ne sangh se judi ek mahila se shaadi kar lee thi jis par ahmedabad main sangh ke andarkhaane halchal much gai thi or log pareshaan the
 The couple was very scared
 jab ye dampati modi ke paas aashirwad lene pahunche, to unki pratikriya dekhakar dang rah gaye
 Modi took out a chocolate from his pocket and said, "don't be in guilt
 tumne koi paap nahin kiya he
 “umaar ka Udarmodi worked in rss-affiliated organizations between 22 and 25 years of age and as a district campaigner
 nirnaayak mode tab aayaa jab indira gandhi ne 1975 main immergency laga di
 During this time Modi came forward as an important strategist of RSS
 ve kai maheenon tak bhumigat rah kar congress virdohi takaton ko madad dete rahe
 In those days he used to ride a Lambretta scooter given to him by RSS and many still remember that Jana Sangh leader Shankarsinh Vaghela used to sit behind him, now a big Congress leader in Gujarat
 modi kaa aglaa yogadan 1979 main morvi baandh kii tabaahi ke shikaar hue logon kii madad karne ke rup main saamne aayaa
 He was in Chennai when he heard the news of the dam breaking
 ve 12 ghanton ke bheetar maukey par pahunch gaye or peediton ke parijanon kii madad ke liye ek trust banane main unki ahm bhoomika rahi
 Parendu Bachubhai Bhagat, who has worked under Modi since then, says, "his leadership in connecting the RSS to help the victims of the Morvi scandal further reinforced his image of being a good organizer in emergencies
" ’’modi ko 1986 main gujarat bijepi main sanghathan sachiv banaakar bheja gaya
 He played an important strategist in the state for the Ayodhya Ram Temple movement
 us dauraan 1987-89 ke bich rajya main sookhaa padaa tha or rajya sarkaar ke raahat kaary se kaaphi asantosh punap rahaa tha
 At that time, Modi along with Vaghela took out a Nyaya Yatra for justice for the drought victims
 us samay tak modi ubharate hue netaa ke taur par charchaa main aane lage the
 He then played a key role in the 1989 Lok Sabha elections and the 1990 state assembly elections
 donon chunaavon main bijepi ke vishwasaneey pradarshan ne unhen ek ahm rajnatik or chunavi ranneetikaar ke taur par majbootee se sthapit kiya
 As a result, he was made a member of the 11-member National Election Committee of the BJP for the 1991 Lok Sabha elections
 1990 se 2000 ke bich modi kam-se-kam chaar baar america ke daure par gaye
 There he made his inroads among the immigrant Indians
 unhone ek apravasi bhartiya kanchan banerjee ke ghar par vakt bitaayaa, jo boston main takaneekavid the
 Modi dined at his house several times
 modi ke atyaadhunik upkarnon se prem ke bare main banerjee bataate hai, ‘‘ek baar jab mere parivaar ne unhen hamaari ore se ek uphaar lene kaa dabaav daalaa to unhone sankoch karte hue ek aadhunik laptop dene ke liye kaha
 We were not even using that modern version then
 hamen jaanakar aashcharya hua ki ve aadhunik takanic se is kadar waakif hai
 "despite being hard on the outside, soft on the inside and extremely hard on getting it done, Modi's soft side shows that he is able to see even the finer points of personal behavior
" ahmedabad main 2007 main hue wibrant gujarat summit ke thik baad ek sahyogi ne modi ko bataaya ki manch par arvind mills ke sanjay lalbhai ko aakhri pankti main baitaane kaa faisla galat tha kyonki ve bahut pratishthit udyogpati hai or unke dada kastoorbhai lalbhai ek udaar samajasevi the
 Principal Secretary to Modi
 kailashnathan ne lalbhai ko turant ek maafee bharaa khat bheja
 Lalbhai was pleasantly surprised by Modi's move
 modi ke falsafe ko gaharaai se samajhnaa ho to unke kavita sangrahon aankh aa dhanya che or sakshibhav ko dekha ja saktaa he, jinamein modi ne 1970 ke dashak main likhi apni diary ke kuch ansh daale hai jab ve raajnneeti main abhi nahin aae the
 Modi also has a ruthless and tough side which is reflected in how he has crushed all his opponents within his party - first in Gujarat, where he has been in disputes with Keshubhai Patel and his former RSS ally Sanjay Joshi
 Entangled and then at the national level, when he was the party's prime ministerial candidate in 2013, bypassing the bjp's unfavorable national leadership
 Emerge ab yah daur modi kaa he, to unki preranaon or uske sroton ke bare main kai tarah ke kayaas lagaae jaaenge or unki vyakhyaayein kii jaaengi
 Whatever they may be, but it cannot be denied that the man who dominated the news in 2014 has led such a simple life that it is no less extraordinary in itself

 Jayawardene said after the win, it is entirely because of the team's solidarity

 manikarnika ne pehle din 8
 75 crores, which is considered to be less than the estimated figures
 film ko mixd rivyus mil rahe hai
 Whoever is coming to see the film is saying that only Kangana is seen in the film
 film ke ko diarector krish ne film main kangana ke saath kaam karne ke apane anubhav saajha kiye hai
 He has also revealed the reason for Sonu Sood leaving the film
 ek intervyuu ke dauraan krish ne kaha ki- film jab banakar taiyaar ho gai to kangana ko film main kuch seens ko lekar aapatti thi
 He seemed to have more scenes of the other characters
 unhone kuch seens ko rishute karne kii baat kahi
 The film's producer Kamal Jain was also with Kangana
 main phir se shoot karne par raji ho gaya or maine prashun joshi ke saath milakar planning kii
 During this, Kangan suddenly said that Sonu's character would have to die in the interval
 jabaki ye puri tarah se itihaas ke khilaaf tha
 Manikarnika: The director said - all she wanted to do was Kangana, Katwa's Seanbakol Krrish, "I did not agree
 sonu film main ek ahm kirdaar play kar rahe the
 In the film, he was in the role of Sadashiv
 unhone 35 dinon tak kaaphi khubsuurati ke saath is kirdaar kii shooting kii thi
 According to history, Sadashiv was supposed to die shortly before Laxmibai in the film, but Kangana's insistence was to kill this role in the interval
 camel bhi kangana ke saath the
 But Sonu did not understand this and refused to work further in the film
 jab itahaas se chhedchhad kaa meri taraf se virodh hua to kangana or camel kii taraf se kaha gaya ki vahi hona chahie jo film ke liye acha he
 "manikarnika Box office Collection Day 1: Kangana's 'manikarnika' made a modest debut, earning so much crores on the first day that at the time of Sonu's exit, Kangana said that Sonu does not want to dictate to a female director
 magar krish ne is par kaha- ye galat he, aisa nahin hua
 What Kangana said is not right
 main sonu ko film se baahar nikalne par doshi nahin maanata hum
 Sonu's run time in the first film was 100 minutes, which was later reduced to 60 minutes
 aise main koun kaam karnaa chahega
 No one will

 mejabaan england team ke khilaaf test shrunkhlaa main karaari haar ke baad duusare ek-divasiy match main badi jeet hasil hone par raahat kii saans lete hue bhartiya captain mahendra singh dhoni ne 50 overon ke praaroop ko form main lautne ke liye acha qaraar diya
 "india will get more support than the England team in the next three matches," Dhoni said after India won by 133 runs in a rain-affected match played in Cardiff using the duckworth-louis method
 aap ek aiami cricket nahin khel sakate
 This is a good format to return to form
 toss ganvaane ke baad pehle ballebaaji karne vaale bharat ne shuruaati jhatkon se ubarkar chah wicket par 304 ran banaae, jinamein suresh raina kii 100 ran kii bejod pari shaamil he
 In response, England were all out for 161 runs chasing a target of 295 runs by the duckworth-louis method
 dhoni ne kaha, shuruyaat mahatvapurn hoti he
 In the first 10 overs, we were not able to score the required runs, but we knew that if after 30 overs we put on a good partnership, then we could double the score
 ullekhneey he ki bhartiya pari ke turant baad barish aa gai thi or dhoni ne kaha ki isse unki team ko phayda mila
 He said, the rain helped our spinners
 rabindra jadeja ne gendbaaji main kamaal dikhaaya or 28 ran dekar chaar wicket liye
 Dhoni said about him, if we talk about the last few series, whenever the ball takes a slight turn, then we saw that it was not easy to score against Jadeja
 unhone kaha, vah usee kshetra main gendbaaji karata he or use wicket se bhi thodaa madad milti he, jo uski safalataa kaa mukhya kaaran he
 With this, he also struggles when he is not helped by the pitch
 use bhi gendbaaj ke rup main sudhaar karne honge
 The good thing is that he is improving and taking wickets for us
 vah hamaare liye nichle kram main upyogi khilaadi he
 He can score runs fast when there are few overs left
 paanch gendbaajon ke saath khilne ke bare main dhoni ne kaha, ham van-de main varshon se paanch gendbaajon ke saath khel rahe hai
 Both Jadeja and Ashwin can bowl and bat
 raina bhi vikalp he, jo kuch over kar saktaa he
 If a bowler does not have a day, Raina can bowl five or six good overs
 paanch gendbaaj hone se meri pareshaaniyaan samaapt ho jaati hai
 He said, the fast bowlers still need to improve
 unhen aaj thodi madad mili
 Apart from this, it has become a little difficult for him in the restrictions of the current fielding
 kul milakar paanch gendbaaj koi samasya nahin hai, kyonki jadeja or aswin ekadash main hote hai

 hira kahaan hai? kahaan he hira? shaayad kohinoor kii tis hogi tabhi hamaare hindi cinema vaale heere ko lekar aise samvaad rachate rahe hai
 Be it a diamond in a don's vault or a bank vault
 hira matlab tarah-tarah ke ajoobe vaala suraksha chakra
 All our heroes are graduates in computer science while stealing diamonds
 aisa lagata he ki algoritham kii khoj inhen logon ne kii thi
 They keep finger on each number slowly
 last number par thodi der kar ke liye aise rukate hai jaise atm kaa pin number yaad kar rahe hon
 By placing the finger on the last number, the door opens and the diamond comes in hand
 jabase sone ke aayaat se pratibandh hataa tha hamaare film vaale ikkisvin sadi main heere kii chori par shift ho gaye
 In order to increase the general knowledge of diamonds in the people, in all the safes, the diamond was always kept in a glass box or in a stand above the box so that every viewer could see that it was a diamond
 kohinoor in tamaam drishyon ke zariye hamaari kisi rashtriya granthi yani complex kaa hissaa rahaa he yaa nahin, daawa nahin kar saktaa magar hira sadaa ke liye chori kaa hi item rahaa he
 That is why our heroes have been taking the risk of bringing diamonds in all the films
 kabhi bhi ve film ke shuru main hira nahin churaate hai
 He practices in the entire film and then steals it in the last scene
 hira or clamex kaa janm-janm kaa naata he
 In Dhoom-2, Hrithik Roshan became the idol of Plaster of Paris
 unke saath heere ke sef main khadaa ho gaya
 i think that the set of diamond theft that happens nowadays is a lift area in a big building where many doors keep opening and closing simultaneously
 usee ko dhokhe se film vaale dikhaate hai ki dekho kitni suraksha he heere kii
 How many doors are there prince main to vivek obray pataa nahin koun sa kapadaa pahentaa he jo 440 volt ke karant ko jhel jaataa he
 In the eyes, how much training does Sushmita Sen give to Paresh Rawal, Arjun Rampal and Akshay Kumar
 paresh rawal to bijepi ke saansad bhi hai
 They should come forward and say that i have stolen diamonds in a film
 wo bhi ankhen band kar ke, sarkaar ajna de to wo kohinoor laa sakate hai
 In Happy New Year, Shah Rukh Khan divides the people of the world into two parts
 kehete hai duniya main do tarah ke log hote hai
 One winner and one loser
 ye amir or garib ke sanathan bantwaare ke market main nayaa item tha jisane puure vimarsh ko hi badal diya
 But not all people go to London to steal a diamond
 mere khyaal se pehle dubai main practice karnaa chaahate honge ki yahaan se ham chura sakate hai yaa nahin
 Later we will think Kohinoor
 king khan kehete hai ki zindagi har luzar ko ek mauqaa detii he taaki wo vinar ban sake
 i swear this dialogue with him, i was first convinced and then injured
 kohinoor aayega
 Life will give us a chance to bring it
 is ummid ke saath main cinema ghar se apane ghar laut aayaa
 In the name of Aurangzeb, we cannot tolerate the road but can be so desperate for Kohinoor touched by Babur's hand, did not understand
 yahi kya kam he moorkhon ne abhi rashtrawaad ke naam par un logon ko deshadrohi nahin ghoshit kiya he jinhone ankhon kaa nur kohinoor angrezon ko tohafe main de diya
 Kohinoor is the name of the occasion for us Hindus to become winners from losers
 ise laane ke naam par gaanv-gaanv gali-gali itihaas ke koodaakaar ajab-gajab ke kutark failaate rahete hai
 As soon as it was learned that Prime Minister Narendra Modi was going to London in November 2015, Hindi channels created a ruckus about the Kohinoor diamond
 kohinoor ko lekar lok swapn rachaa gaya ki yahi he wo hira
 Look closely, tear your eyes and see
 modi ji lekar aane vaale hai
 The channels did a trick
 jab bhi likhaa, prashnvachak chinh ke saath hi likhaa ki modi queen se kohinoor kii maang kar sakate hai? kya modi queen ke saath lunch ke dauraan kohinoor heere kii maang kargen ? you tub par maujuud in channelon kii cliping se pataa chalata he ki acha khaasaa propeganda khadaa kiya gaya
 His words made it seem as if PM Modi was going to say during lunch that Madam, the diamond which is placed next to you, if found
 
 
 main nahin, hamaare mulk ke channel vaale maang rahe hai
 
 
 if
 
 
 nahin to koi baat nahin
 
 
 
 
 There was a lot of news based on 'aisa Pyaar Hai'
 kisase pataa chalaa he kisi ne nahin bataaya
 It is revealed as if the jungle-jungle thing has gone
 mujhe to aisa hi sound karata he
 On the other hand, Azam Khan from Uttar Pradesh started making statements that the Prime Minister should bring Kohinoor as well as bring the ring of Tipu Sultan from London on which Ram is written
 kuch to khyaal rakhaa hota aazam sahab states kaa bhi
 The jeweler did not go to the shop to ask for a ring with diamonds from our PM
 heere kii maang hui yaa nahin, kisi ko pataa nahin
 The comments bhartiya rashtrawaad ke kuch rikt sthaan hai jise hamaari raajnneeti is ummid main kunthit karti rahati he ki kabhi hameen bharenge
 Our nationalism will not be complete until we fill it
 sansad se lekar sadak par kohinoor bhi us rikt sthaan kii tarah pesh kiya jaataa rahaa he jise landan se laakar bharaa janaa tha
 But hi
 sarkaar ne ye kya kar diya
 If someone had not been robbed, he would have said that he had stolen it
 ye bhi bolne kii koi baat thi ki hamane tohfe main diya he
 The Modi government abolished all the excitement regarding Kohinoor
 modi ji jab landan yatra par the tab britain ke pradhanmantri ne enditivi se kaha ki ham kohinoor nahin denge
 In this way only our museum will be empty
 saim tu saim baat bharat ke solicytor general ranjit kumaar ne supreme court main kahi he ki aisa karenge to hamaare musium khaali ho jaaenge
 Go o world people, we sacrificed the dream of the country for the sake of the museum
 lekin supreme court ko abhi bhi last hope he isliye court ne cese ko kaarij nahin kiya taaki bhavishya main koi daawa kare to mushkil na pesh aae ki aapaki court ne ise riject kiya hua he
 That is, the Supreme Court has kept that dream alive
