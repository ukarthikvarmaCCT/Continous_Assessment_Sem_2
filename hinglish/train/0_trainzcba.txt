 ab aise air purifaire kahaan tak bacchon ko dinabhar chalane vaale trephic ke dhuen se bachaayenge
 According to the parents, it is necessary to send the children to school and if the school is on the main road then there is pollution, then the parents are forced and the pollution is increasing

 varsh 2014 kii 26 may kii subah kii baat he, jab bijepi ke ek varisht netaa kii neend ek phone kol se khuli thi
 Named at the other end was Omprakash Singh, personal assistant to Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 unhone us netaa se rajdhani main gujarat bhawan main naashte par milane kaa anurodh kiya
 After the meeting, the leader realized that Singh's call was the first formal indication of Modi's induction into the Council of Ministers later that same day
 singh na to pradhanmantri karyaalay (piemo) main koi ek or cheharaavihin padaadhikari hai, na pad par baithaae gaye koi pichhalggu
 As an executive assistant to Modi, he is a key figure in the circle around the Prime Minister, and was therefore tasked with calling
 ve satta ke us galiyare kaa hissaa hai, jo piemo ke daravaaje kii ore jaataa he or usase hokar hi adhikansh log modi tak pahunch sakate hai-chaahe ve sarkaar main hon, yaa sarkaar ke baahar
 After working as Modi's personal assistant since 1998, when Modi was BJP general secretary, Singh continued to serve Modi during his tenure as the Chief Minister of Gujarat
 baad main modi unhen 7 rescorse road main apane nijee staff ke hisse ke rup main le aae
 On the surface, it may seem that due to his personal loyalty, Singh should be part of the class of close associates of Modi
 lekin party ke diggaj kehete hai ki sataha se gaharaai par dekho, to yah cheharaa ek vaicharik rup se patibaddh bhagava judaav kaa he-ain duusare chor kii rajnatik bhashaa main kahen, to ek jamini kaaryakarta kaa
 Singh is one of the first one-two batch workers trained at Surya Foundation
 yah foundation bijepi kii rashtriya kaaryakarini ke sadsy or udyogpati jai prakaash agarwal chalaate hai jo 1990 ke dashak ke madhya se ek vrihattar bhagava parivaar se aae vaicharik rup se patibaddh yuvaaon ko taiyaar kar rahaa he
 More than half a dozen of the Foundation's trainees comprise the personal staff of various ministers
 rajnatik satta ke nae dwarapalon main singh sirf ek misaal hai
 This situation is not only completely different from the UPA-1 and 2 governments, but — to a large extent — except the NDA government of Atal Bihari Vajpayee — it is different from all previous central governments, including all public experiments
 ye sabhi log vaicharik rup se patibaddh karmi hai, unamem se kai kii rajnatik mahatvakankshaayen bhi hai, or ve apane is kaarykaal kaa prayog bada netaa banane kii raah main ek seedhi ke rup main kar rahe hai
 Although usually gazetted officers are appointed as private secretaries (PS) of Union Ministers to coordinate with the bureaucracy on policy issues, such persons have been included in the private staff of ministers for many years, Who act as political gatekeepers for their masters
 ve apane sambandhit mantri ke saaye main kaam karte hai, lekin satta ke galiyaaron main unka dabadabaa hota he
 They are an important link to most non-official and political activities of ministers
 itane dashakon main, in rajnatik taur par niyukt or rajpatrit adhikariyon ne apane anubhav ke rup main jo kuch safaltaapurvak prachaarit kiya he, uske boote khud ko lagbhag aprihaary bana liya he
 As a result, outgoing ministers often recommend them to their successors, even across party lines
 haalanki modi ne satta sanbhaalane ke baad jald hi in rajnatik taur par sthapit upie sarkaar ke dwarapalon ko ek hi jatke main saaf kar diya
 He instructed his ministers that they would not hire any private staff-ps, APS, Personal Assistant (PA) of UPA ministers except grade-3 and grade-4 staff
 jahaan rajpatrit adhikariyon ko kahin or posting mil gai, vahiin asli khamiyaja un logon ko bhugatna padaa, jo upie ke mantriyon ke chaaya purushon ke rup main malaaidaar padon par satta sukh kaa majaa le rahe the
 Many of these people can still be seen in the corridors of power in Delhi, who do not hesitate to change loyalty and ideology
 lekin abhi tak koi daraar najar nahin ai he
 The reason is that the gatekeepers chosen by Modi's people are drawn from the class of activists and employees, who are from the wider Sangh Parivar and trained in government work, and are experts in keeping the hangers out because of their ideological perseverance
 
 aise kam-se-kam teen darjan padaadhikari ab aadhikarik taur par kendriya mantriyon kii seva main hai, or modi ke kam-se-kam 21 mantrimandaleey sahyogiyon ne unako niyukt kiya hua he, (dekhen box)
 On the contrary, most of the appointed persons of UPA ministers got jobs due to their personal loyalty to the minister concerned
 sutron kaa kahana he ki kuch maamalon main, in padaadhikariyon ko mantriyon ke vyaktigat sahyogi varg main bhagava parivaar ke varisht netaaon ke anurodh par shaamil kiya gaya he
 In such a situation, it can be said that these workers have been trained by the leaders themselves for years, when their stature within the party itself was growing

 Former captain Moin Khan feels that after the dismal tour of South Africa, the time has come when some major changes should be made in the Pakistani team
 is purv wicketiper ballebaaj ne kaha ki senior khilaadiyon ne dakshin africa main team ko test or vanade siries donon main niraash kiya he
 He said, "these players have served Pakistan cricket well for many years but i think now is the time for the Cricket Board to take some tough decisions after visiting South Africa
" ’’ The unemployed will have to say that if it is somewhere, then the government can be seen
 kyonki sarkaar ke paas naukariyon ke jo aankade hai usase lagata he ki berojgaar naukari lekar mujhase whatsap massej se mazaaq karte rahete hai ki hamaari khabar dikhaa dijie
 We just want to look unemployed on TV by taking a job
 jis raftaar se alag-alag rajyon ke berojgaaron ke paas mere number pahunch ja rahaa he
 
 
 May i not be unemployed
 aaj do baaten hui
 Mahesh Vyas has given the figure that three times in the last six weeks the unemployment rate has been more than 10 percent
 yah kisi bhi str se bhayankar he
 The second incident is that today the engineers of Maharashtra attacked my phone
 unka daawa he ki ve sankhya main 75,000 hai or sarkaar unhen diploma ejiniyaron kii bhartee main shaamil nahin hone de rahi he
 These engineers also staged an 11-day sit-in at the Pune Commissionerate
 jisamen tarah-tarah se pradarshan kiye or kai netaaon se mulaakaat kii
 Sold bananas, sold tea
 degree bechney kaa pradarshan kiya
 They say that at this time the Maharashtra government has removed the Mahabharti
 PWD, sichaai or jal sangrakshan vibhaag main
 Vacancy has come for 2500 junior engineers
 zaahir he 1998 ke niyamon ke anusaar sirf diploma ejeeniyar hi isamen shaamil ho sakate hai
 Diploma engineers also do not want anyone else to test their qualifications
 kyonki ejiniyaron kii bahaali hogi to diploma ejeeniyar ko mauka nahin milegaa
 But unemployment is so high that the patience of young people is falling apart
 chaatro ne mujhe samajhaayaa ki maharashtra kaa chayan ayog ejeeniyar kii bahaali main kai saal le letaa he
 The result of the 2017 examination has come recently
 vah bhi 15-200 vaikency nikalati he
 If a junior engineer gets a job in the same examination, then it is expected to happen quickly
 isliye unhen bhi mauka milanaa chahie
 After all, why the restoration does not come out for 75,000 engineers
 jo ki baat sahi bhi he
 They say that the government can change the rules and allow them to join the recruitment too
 inhen is baat kaa bharosa he ki prime time main dikhaa dene se maharasht sarkaar neend se jaag jaaegi
 So let me assure you, does the Maharashtra government know whether it wakes up or not? Only those who are unemployed know their pain
 bas meri nazar main unki kami yahi he ki ve sab apni apni ladaai lard rahe hai
 It is not that these people do not fight, but fighting in their islands does not lead to results
 ab 11 farvari ko jab lakhanu main priyanka gandhi raily kar rahi thim tab bahut se ejeeniyar congress daftar pahunch gaye
 Not to attend the rally, but to contact the journalists who came from Delhi, that someone should raise their point and the Chief Minister Yogi's eyesight be disturbed
 hamaare sahyogi manoranjan bharti ne ek se sampark kara diya
 He told that about 2200 engineers are going to be employed in Uttar Pradesh
 inamen se ek ne bataaya ki vah gujarat main ek multinational company main kaam karata tha
 UP came in the same salary
 aisi hi kahani kaiyon kii he
 When he saw the advertisement that UP Power Corporation Limited wanted engineers through outsourcing, he came to the job in his state
 inkaa intervyuu hua or phir salection
 Some were b
tech and some diplomas
 sabhi ko pradhanmantri ke dream project saubhaahgya yojana ke liye kaam par rakhe jane the
 Their job was to provide electricity from door to door
 inkaa kahana he ki jamkar mehnat kii or din raat kaam kar apana lakshya puraa kar diya, lekin abhi bhi kai zilon main 45 pratishat kaam adhuraa he
 Nevertheless, these engineers were removed from the three zones
 inkaa yah bhi kahana he ki upi main vidyut vibhaag main 60,000 se adhik pad rikt hai to inhen kyon hataaya ja rahaa he
 All these have been removed from the order of 28 February
 zaahir he 15 maheene ke kantrect ke liye rakhaa gaya tha, magar 6-7 maheene main hi nikaal diya gaya
 These 2000 engineers also understood that if the Hindu Muslim debates on TV, where will their problems be found? neshnal sample survey 2017-18 kaa data saamne nahin aa sakaa
 Two or two members of the National Statistical Commission also resigned, yet the unemployment figures are coming out in the same way

 IIM Ahmedabad has given a report that BSNL has 5 times more employees as compared to private telecom companies
 beasenal aarthik sankat se guzar rahaa he, isliye apane kharchon main katautee ke liye kai tarah ke upayon par vichaar kiya ja rahaa he
 In this, medical bills and travel allowances are being cut
 pichhali timahi main beasenal ko kareeb do hazaar karod kaa ghaataa hua tha
 What is the reason for the loss
 ham sheersh adhikariyon kaa bayaan nahin le sake, lekin union waalon kaa kahana he ki beasenel ke paas 4ji nahin hone ke kaaran ve baaki companiyon ke saath pratiyogita nahin kar paa rahe hai
 We told you different stories so that you see what is happening in the job sector
 abhi tak is baat ke kam aankade aae hai ki nichle str par kaam karne waalon kii selary kitni badi he, uske badhane kii raftaar kya he
 Recently, there was news that according to the report of National Sample Survey 2017-18, the survey has recorded the highest unemployment in 45 years

 2 pratishat thi
 The government is not ready to accept
 jo sector naukariyon kaa sirf 10 pratishat pratinidhitiv karata he, main uske kuch aankade dena chahta hum
 i want to give that 10 percent account
 sitambar 2017 se lekar november 2018 tak kareeb 15 maheene main 1 karod 80 lakh logon ne pehali baar provident fund kataanaa shuru kiya
 Does it happen without employment? inamen se 64 percent log hai jinaki umr 28 saal he
 Apart from this, i want to give you another fact
 hamaare desh main march 2014 main kareeb 65 lakh logon ko neshnal pension system main register kiya gaya
 In October last year, this number has gone to 12 million
 yah bhi bina naukari ke hua
 Would anyone have paid the same tax? raashtrapati ke abhibhaashan par bolte hue pradhanmantri ne rojgaar par kai baaten rakhin
 You should read the entire speech
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki 4 saal me 36 lakh bade trek yaa commercial wheekals bike hai
 About 150 million passenger vehicles have been sold
 27 lakh se zyada auto kii bikri hui he, jinhone bhi ye gadiyon kharidi hai, unako chalaane vaala hoga
 There must have been employment around it too
 magar trek operators vaale turant hi khandan karne lage

 com / 19a6duj6ir kyasadhvi prachior justisemarkandeya katjumen koi samanta he? philhal is sawaal kaa jawaab he - 'haa'
 In some detail, both of them have called Mahatma Gandhi a British agent
 ek schuli chaatra kaa researchmahatma gandhi koun the? unhen rashtrapita kyon kehete hai? lakhanu kii ek schuli chaatra aishwarya parashar ko pehle sawaal kaa jawaab to mil gaya tha, lekin duusare prashn kaa uttar nahin mil rahaa tha
 Then with the help of right to information, he discovered that the Central Government has no record of declaring Mahatma Gandhi as the Father of the Nation
 mahatma gandhiji ko bas adarpurvak rashtrapita kaha jaataa he
 Similarly, some other school students enlisted the help of their parents, teachers and books and found that Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose had first addressed his message from Singapore radio to Mahatma Gandhi as 'father of the Nation'
 uske baad 30 janvari, 1948 ko tatkaaleen pradhanmantri jawaharlal nehru ne radio par hi raashtra ke naam sandesh main kaha ki 'rashtrapita ab nahin rahe
 'justice Katju's research question which was in Aishwarya's mind may have been in the mind of Justice Markandey Katju too
 katju ne research kiya to kuch nayaa hi khoj nikaala
 Then on March 10, Justice Katju made a tweet
 apane twit main unhone kaha, "gandhi angrejon ke agent the, or subhash chandra bose japaniyon ke agent the
 There is not much difference between the two agents
 "justise katju ne blog par ek post likhaa 'gandhi- e british agent'
 In this post, Katju explains that Mahatma Gandhi used to work on the policy of 'divide and rule' by the British
 katju kaa kahana he ki gandhi angrejon ke agent the, jinhone bharat ko nuksaan pahunchaaya
 In support of his point, Katju has also provided some examples
 katju kaa kahana he ki gandhi aadyogikeekaran nahin balki charkha chalaane kaa prachaar karnaa chaahate the
 He says that by looking at Gandhi's speeches and writings, it seems that his inclination and emphasis was more towards the ideas of Hinduism (like Ramrajya, Gauraksha etc

 kya sadhvi ke bayaan par bhi sansad main ninda prastaav paarit kiya jayega? Senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and former External Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh said Kanimozhi and A, mps of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) jailed in the 2G spectrum scam
 raja ke saath-saath anya aropiyon ko jamaanat de deni chahie
 During an interview, Singh asked, "why should they stay in jail? How are they interfering in the case? Asked by Singh that Kanimozhi, former Union Telecom Minister Raja and former Telecom Ministry minister in the 2G spectrum scam case Shouldn't the main accused, including bureaucrats, remain in jail
 is sawaal par singh ne apni raay rakhi
 The BJP leader said, "I believe that if anyone has been accused and that charge is not of robbery, murder or such a serious nature
 
 And while the trial is going on, one should not be kept in jail because you cannot always refuse bail
 " singh ne kaha ki ye unke nijee vichaar hai
 He, however, said that he does not think that the BJP wants the accused to be kept in jail permanently

 Bhootnath has returned again
 bhootnath ne siddh karne kii koshish kii he ki jis kaam kii ummid ab insaanon se nahin kii ja sakati, use puraa karne ke liye yaa to bhoot ko aana padegaa yaa phir kisi alian ko
 Bhootnath of 2008 is the same as in 2014
 amitabh bachchan ke film main aa jane se ummiden bad jaati hai or ve kaaphi had tak ummiido par khare utre hai
 The film accurately portrays the current political and social environment
 aarakshan or satyagrah jaisi subject oriented filmein dene ke baad phir se big bi vishay aadhaarit film hi lekar aae hai
 One aspect of the film that gets stuck a bit is the messenger
 film kii length bhi thodi zyada he
 Of course, the film is fun
 kahani main kitna damakahani ek bhoot or bachche ke khattey-mithe safar par aadhaarit he
 But Bollywood directors give up their hold on the story in the coming second half, something similar can also be said about Bhootnath Returns
 kahani kii shuruyaat ek bhoot ke sangharsh se hoti he
 He has no respect in the ghostland
 use bhuton ke bich sammaan paane ke liye waapas dharti par aana padataa he, or bhootnath kii tarah is baar bhi use ek baccha akhrot mil jaataa he
 Bhootnath is seen by him only
 parth kii kuch samasyaayein hoti hai
 Bhootnath tries to drive them away
 bhaau (baman irani) aa jaataa he
 Then elections and maneuvers begin
 kahani second half main bhootnath se zyada chunaav par focus ho jaati he
 a little taste deteriorates here
 star apilahameshaa kii tarah amitabh bachchan laajawab hai
 His acting is amazing
 unki comic timming ke to kya kehane or energy bhi kamaal kii he
 Walnut is fun
 kahi-kahin yah chota-sa baccha film ke bade-bade stars par bhi baari padataa he
 His style is very funny
 hameshaa kii tarah baman irani bhi kamaal hai
 They try something new in each of their films and always become something of a villain who laughs even with fear, and touches the heart
 kamai kii batfilm ellection sijan main relies hui he or darshakon se conect karti he
 Jugalbandi of Amitabh and Partha is the USP of the film
 haalanki is sikval kaa pichley part se zyada koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 The story and its tone are brand new
 amitabh, parth or baman film kii euaspy hai
 The film is also very funny
 is weekend antertenment ke saath hi kuch sarthak sandesh liye, yah film dekhnaa badhiya he
 Speaking of fun, Bhootnath

 Earlier, the biggest problem of the users was that apps were not installed in the micro SD card
 samsung or alji ke is kadam se kai yugers kaaphi niraash honge kyonki ab zyada sies ke ap mobile kii memory jaldi khatm kar dete hai
 When Samsung was asked the reason for not giving this feature to Samsung's argument, its reply was also surprising
 company ne kaha ' company marshmelo ke adopteble storage feechar isliye nahin degi kyonki hamen lagata he ki hamaare yugers micro esady card kaa yuj phone se clic kiye hue photose, videos or gaanon ko dusredivis main files transfarkarne ke liye karte hai
 Samsung also says that Adoptable Storage is designed keeping in mind a smartphone with 4-8GB internal storage
 samsung iske liye kuch bhi daleel de par kai yugers ise sahi nahin maanate kyonki ve file transfar karne ke liye data cabel kaa yuj karte hai yaa OTG yuj karte hai jo kaaphi aasaan hai
 Advantages of Adoptable Storage: The Adoptable Storage feature of Marshmallow has two options
 jaise hi aap mobile main memory card lagaate hai aapke saamne do opshan hote hai
 In the first option, the card can be used as portable storage in which only files can be stored
 duusare main card ko internal storage kii tarah yuj kiya ja saktaa he
 If you use it as internal storage, then the memory card has to be formatted first
 uske baad internal memory or micro esady card marz ho jate hai

 (this satire is only the imagination of the writer ) Entering the name of himself and his family members for the census 2010, RJD supremo and former Union minister Lalu Prasad joked that he was 48 and his wife Rabdi Devi was 55, on Thursday
 janaganana ke liye aankada ekatra karne patna main purv mukhyamantri or bihar vidhansabha main pratipaksh kii netaa rabari devi ke sarkari awaas pahunche janaganana vibhaag ke nideshak ke senthil kumaar or anya karmiyon se lalu ne apane ko 48 kaa or patni rabadi devi ko 55 kaa bataaya
 When Lalu's media persons present there asked him if his wife was older than him, Lalu jokingly said that she does not know about this but she can grow up
 baad main lalu ne logon kii badhati jigyaasa ko yah kahkar turant shant kiya ki unke kehane kaa matlab tha ki unka janm 1948 main hua he or unki patni kaa janm 1955 main hua
 This is the first round of data collection for the census and will end in the month of June or July this year

 Distances between Pakistan Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani and President Asif Ali Zardari are increasing daily
 samachar patr 'da news' main mangalvaar ko chhapi ek report ke mutabik gilaani kaa rukh kadaa he or vah sarkaar ko vastav main ek pradhanmantri ke rup chalaanaa chaahate hai
 Quoting sources, the newspaper has written that Gilani's patience has been answered by the increasing interference of the President's office in day-to-day functioning
 yahi kaaran he ki desh ke do sheersh padon ke bich tanaav paidaa ho gaya he
 One reason for differences grew was British Prime Minister Garden Brown's recent visit to Pakistan when President Zardari represented Pakistan instead of Gilani at a joint press conference
 akhbaar ke anusaar gilaani ne is maamle ko uthaate hue jor diya ki protocol ke anusaar donon pradhanmantriyon ko samvaadadaata sammelan ko sambodhit karnaa chahie
 There are reports that Zardari wants to become Prime Minister by ending the controversial 17th constitutional amendment of former military ruler Pervez Musharraf
 musharraf ne pradhanmantri pad ke sabhi visheshadhikaar raashtrapati pad main samahit kar die the
 The most important is to abolish the provision allowing only graduates to participate in parliamentary elections

 According to 'the News', due to tensions between Geelani and Zardari, the posts of three important officials directly related to the post of Prime Minister have been lying vacant for months

 The atmosphere has started to build on the first Indian Grand Prix being held later this month on the Buddha International Circuit in Greater Noida

 In the presence of thousands of spectators, the driver of Red Bull, Daniel Ricciadre, raced his car in front of Rashtrapati Bhavan on the Rajpath thrice at a speed of up to 270 kmph

 Nitin Kumar Reddy was studying mechanical engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras
 har din vah nayab movie downlod karata or iity main sabhi students ko jodgaye vaale local computer network main unhen share kar detaa
 But on a sultry hot afternoon of May 2011, Reddy closed the door of his hostel room on the third floor and hung himself from the ceiling fan
 is ghatana se iity madras stabdh rah gaya, jahaan ke kareeb 620 acre vaale parisar main 8,000 chaatr or 530 shikshak, kareeb 400 prajatiyon ke paudhon, kaale hiranon, chhipakaliyon, kachhuon or jahirile naagon ke saath rahete hai
 Reddy, a final year student, was unable to complete a project in time and was asked to wait six months to complete it, while his department colleagues had graduated
 shaayad reddy academik dabaav nahin jhel paaya yaa institute main rukne kii shame use bardaasht nahin hui
 Or he was upset that he would no longer get a good job
 vajah chaahe jo bhi ho, 24 varsh ke is noujvaan kii aatmahatya sabhi iity main fail chuki ek beemaari kaa sanket detii he
 According to the government, 10 IIT students have committed suicide since 2010
 2011 main hi iity madras or iity khadipur main do-do aatmahatya, or iity kanpur evam iity dilli main ek-ek aatmahatya kii ghatnaayen hui hai
 a government task force found that in the last two years, there have been 18 suicide attempts in these technical institutions run by the Central Government Fund
 desh ke sabase umdaa technical ajukeshan chen iity main ‘‘aal ij wel’’ nahin he
 Millions of youth have been dreaming of reaching these institutions since the 1950s
 2012 main iity kii 9,647 undergraduate siton ke liye hone vaali sanyukt pravesh pariksha yani jeii main record 4,79,651 candidet shaamil hue the
 And this year when the JEE will be held in June, this number can cross five lakhs
 smart, lekin sarvshereshth naheepichley varshon main apane kathin standard ke liye jaani ja rahi jeii main bhi kai khamiyaan saamne ai hai
 Knowledgeable people say that smart minds are reaching iits, but it is not necessarily the best minds
 yah sab aise samay main ho rahaa he, jab singapore kii naanyang technological uniwarsity, honkong uniwarsity of science and technology, singh hua uniwarsity of beijing or korea ke advanced institute of science and technology jaise pratispardhi ejineering skool duniyabar main pramukhataa hasil kar rahe hai
 The reason for this is to a large extent that IIT has expanded rapidly in the last five years
 isse inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa ki iity se nikalne vaale chaatro kii gunvattta ghat rahi he-kam se kam tulanaatmak rup se hi-or brands iity kii pratishtha kam ho rahi he
 Whereas these institutions have played an important role in changing the image of India from the shores of the shoemakers to "country of mouse (computer mouse)"
 is samay desh main kul 16 iity hai
 Nine of these institutions have opened since 2008
 iskaa nateeja yah hua he ki iity ke prati dharna badali he
 Many professors and job recruiters say that the new iits in Bhubaneswar, Gandhinagar, Hyderabad, Jodhpur, Ropar, Patna, Indore and Mandi are not the same as the world expects iits to be
 nae main puraanon-si shaan nahinpahchaan jaahir na karne kii shart par iity dilli ke computer science ke ek varisht professor ne kaha, ‘‘amployrs ko puraane iity (khadipur, bombai, madras, kanpur, dilli) or nae iity ke bich antar saaf pataa he
 Along with the old iits and later institutions like Roorkee and Guwahati, now new iits are also in the field
 ’’ duniyabar main faile iity ke purv chaatro kii bhi kuch aisi hi raay he
 Indra Singhal, a San Francisco serial entrepreneur and alumnus of IIT Kharagpur, said, "until now, IIT used to mean something, now it is being differentiated on the basis of location after IIT
 ’’ is antar se iity ke prati soch bighad rahi he
 Anand Jagannathan, founder-ceo of Newsstand Corp, a student of IIT Kanpur in 1974, also says, "the brand iits are getting lighter now because their numbers are increasing so that there is no such thing as getting the best people there
" ’’yah sirf iity ke ilit tamge ko banaae rakhane ke bhaavnaatmak tark hi nahin hai
 Employers are differentiating because of quality
 zyaadaatar chote shaharon or kasbon main sthapit hone vaale nae iity na to acchhee faikalti aakarshith kar paa rahe hai or na hi unamem puraane iity jaisi suvidhaayen hai
 Take the example of Intel
 yah chip nirmaataa company har saal bharat se 150 ejiniyaron kii bhartee karti he
 Most of them are of IIT
 company main tallent delivery kii senior manager aprita singh kahati hai, ‘‘ham nae iity main nahin jate kyonki inke chaatro kii gunvattta main antar hota he
 Other mncs also do not want to move to the new iits
 ’’degree he, par kaam kii nahinyah mahatvapurn mudda he
 Many surveys have said that only one out of every four engineers in India is fit for employment, that too after training
 pratibha kaa akalan karne vaali company aspiring minds ke 2011 ke ek adhyayan main paaya gaya ki graduate ejiniyaron kaa sirf 17
 45% in Information Technology (IT) services sector and only 2
 68 fisadi hissaa ity product companiyon main rojgaar paane laayak he
 On the other hand, Mohandas Pai, former HR head of Infosys, says that India needs around 400,000 engineers every year
 vibhinn jagahon par faile iity kii zyada sankhya se bhavishya main gunvattta vaale ejiniyaron kii aapurti main madad mil sakati he, lekin shikshavid jis gunvattta kii talash kar rahe hai use hasil karnaa kathin lag rahaa he
 One way to increase the quality of education in the new iits is to bring the faculty of the top class, but it is not as easy to say
 iity ke assistant professor kaa vetan 75,000 ru
 The month starts, it is less than that which many engineers from Tier Two colleges get in the first salary
 kahaan hai achche teacher?iity bombai ke purv diarector or ab jeii apeks board ke chairman ashok mishra kehete hai, ‘‘log teaching main apane junun kii vajah se jate hai
 But when you see that your colleagues working in corporate are taking four times salary from you then it affects your spirit of teaching
 ’’ vidambnaa yah he ki kai jeii koching centaron main padhaane vaale bhi unase chah guna zyada paa rahe hai

 in 2004 from the same institute
 tech karne vaale jagannathan ne yahaan ke electrical ejineering department main assistant professor ke rup main jwine karne se pehle masachusets institute of technology se piechdi kii thi
 His paper has been included in two journals and a conference in the last one and half year job of IIT, Madras
 jagannathan kii is research se pichley ek dashak kii tulana main iity madras ke standard main thodaa sudhaar hua he
 Average of 1 publication by every faculty member in IIT Madras in 2002-03
 23 hi tha
 This figure 1 in other iits
 03 se 1
 Was up to 69
 2011-12 main iity madras ke prophessoron kaa yah ausat badhkar 2
 Reached 05
 iity bombai ne march, 2010 se ab tak videsh se 100 logon ko apane yahaan naukari di he
 The IIT Madras faculty also has about 30 such people
 research par jor dene kii ek vajah yah bhi he ki isse faikalti kii kami ko dur kiya ja sake
 The Anil Kakodkar Committee of 2010, in its recommendations for IIT, had set a target to produce 10,000 doctoral fellows (phds) every year by 2020-25, compared to the current 1,000
 ummid yah he ki aise piechdi main se kuch iity main hi padhaane ke liye ruk jaaenge
 In terms of the number of IIT professors, the student-teacher is far from the ideal figure that is required for good teaching
 puraane iity main shikshak-chaatr kaa anupaat 1:16 kaa he, jabaki adarsh rup main yah anupaat 1:10 kaa hona chahie
 The quality of seats has not increased at the pace of sudden increase in the number of seats
 2007 main iity main 5,537 undergraduate siten thim
 In 2012, this number rose to 9,647
 siton kii yah sankhya zyaadaatar arakshit varg main badi he kyonki maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantralay ne 2008 main anya pichde virgon (obisi) ke liye 27 fisadi aarakshan lagu kar diya
 Krishnan Balasubrahmanyam, professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at IIT Madras, says, "people believe that quality has declined
 yah swaabhaavik he kyonki aaj aap 50 fisadi zyada logon kaa pravesh le rahe hai
 "the problem of teacher shortage is made more serious by the fact that many students are not able to connect with older teachers who teach on 20-year-old notes and are not up-to-date as per the changing times
" iity kanpur se 2010 main postagraduate or ab samsung main kaam karne vaali armin mustafa kahati hai ki unhen saubhaahgya se achche shikshak mili the
 She says, "there were two to three professors at IIT who didn't teach much
 ve ek semester main aadha classes hi puraa karte the
 They were either on leave or absent
 ’’ naam na jaahir karne kii shart par iity kanpur ke ek professor is baat se sahamat dikhe ki iity corcej kii gunvattta main giravat ai he
 He said, "twenty-five years ago, teachers gave assignments to students every week, graded them and returned them to students
 aaj ve asinament nahin de sakate kyonki unki grading karne main bahut samay lagata he
 "the class size has grown and there is no longer personal contact with students
" course work main to kami dikh hi rahi he, ab yah aarope bhi lagaaya jane laga he ki arakshit varg kii siton main baari vistaar kii vajah se iity main sambhavat: kam merit vaale chaatro kii bhartee ho rahi he
 But this is a sensitive matter and most professors hesitate to talk about the quality of reserved category students
 lekin yah saaf he ki har koi class main bhedbhaav ko lekar chintit he
 The Kakodkar Committee conducted an online survey to get opinions from all the parties (including teachers and students) related to the IIT system
 isamen bade bahumat se logon ne jeii kii samay-samay par samiksha karne kaa suzav diya tha or gunvattta kii keemat par siton ke vistaar ke khilaaf chetavanee di thi
 The Changing Sociology of Talent Some people say that the big change in the Indian education complexes is actually a reflection of the changes in the population of India and the increase of aspiration
 zyada se zyada iity undergraduate ab chote kasbon se aa rahe hai
 "there is no significant difference between general and OBC students," says a professor who holds administrative responsibility at an IIT
 lekin bahut se duusare chaatro, khaskar hindi madhyam se padhakar aane waalon ko lekturer ko samajhane main dikkat hoti he
 English is the medium of instruction at IIT
 ve kehete hai, ‘‘unhen pehle saal main bahut dikkat hoti he
 Average grade 7 in four years
 3 hota he
 SC / ST class students around 6
 5 grad hasil karte hai
 "recently, the number of girl students in IIT has started increasing
 philhal, saamaanya varg main jeii ke liye aavedan karne waalon main 21 fisadi ladkiyaan hoti hai
 Now students are paying more attention to careers
 iity dilli ke computer science ke ek professor ne kaha ki gunvattta main badlaav aane kii dharna asal main saanskrithik badlaavon kii vajah se he
 He said, "twenty years ago there used to be talented people who had no ambition for career
 ve ajibo-garib kaam karte the or parikshaon main safalataa hasil karte the
 Today, from the day of taking admission in IIT, the path of everyone's career is set
 ’’maujuuda jeii vyavastha main aisi kuch dikkatein hai jisase shaayad asal pratibhavan chaatr chhot ja rahe hon or iske undergraduate corcej main bas smart chaatro kaa pravesh ho rahaa ho
 The professors say that in the coaching run for the entrance examination, candidates are made smarter for success in JEE
 jeii kii ek report ke anusaar, exam dene vaale har paanch chaatro main se sirf ek ne jeii 2012 ke liye koching lee thi, lekin safal abhyarthiyon main inaki sankhya kareeb aadhi he
 "we are getting good students," says Bhaskar Ramamurthy, director of IIT Madras
 lekin yah kahana kathin he ki ham sarvshereshth chaatr hasil kar rahe hai
 If i went to some coaching, i was taught how to make decisions and move forward when a question is beyond my comprehension
 lekin pratibhavan chaatr kii soch to yah hoti he ki ‘‘main ise hal karuunga
 "it may be that such a student wastes a lot of time in a single question
" ’’koching karoge, to milegaa!baat kuch ajeeb lagati he, lekin iity kai tareekon se koching udyog ko badhaane ke liye khud hi jimmedaar hai
 Earlier, JEE consisted of a multiple choice screening test, after which the candidates had to appear in a question-solving examination, in which the grades were screened by teachers
 lekin candidats kii sankhya badaae kii vajah se aisi grading kathin ho gai
 Ramamurthy said, "around 2000 we made a big mistake
 hamane duusari pariksha ko khatm karne kaa nirnay liya
 This led to coaching for multiple choice questions
 hamen yah anumaan nahin tha ki is tarah kii koching se is pariksha main gadabad ho jaaegi
 Now no one is taught for real understanding
 ’’ nateeja: chaatr ab course ke kaam ko lekar kam gambhir hai
 Professor Balasubrahmanyam, who joined IIT Madras about 13 years ago, said, "during the first six to seven years of my tenure, every year 5 to 10 students of undergraduate level were published in my department
 aaj hamen is str par aisa ek chaatr bhi badi mushkil se miltaa he
 "even beyond IIT, where there are some recruiters and academics among all these people feel that the gap between IIT and other engineering institutions has narrowed

 He had said, 'I was sad that i was working at one time and suddenly i had to be out of work without reason

 ' Some time ago, a video went viral in which Anushka Sharma was seen scolding a person named Arhan Singh for spreading garbage on the road
 ab arhan ne viraat kohli or anoushka sharma ko notice bhej diya he
 Arhan said till date that i do not want to comment on this matter yet
 mujhe abhi unke jawaab kaa intjaar karnaa chahie
 In fact, on 16 June, Virat Kohli shared a video on his social media account, in which Anushka Sharma was seen scolding a man who threw garbage on the road
 Saw these people throwing garbage on the road & pulled them up rightfully
 Traveling in a luxury car and brains gone for a toss
 These people will keep our country clean? Yeah right! If you see something wrong happening like this, do the same & spread awareness
 @anushkasharmapic

 com / p8flrmcnba — Virat Kohli (@imvkohli) June 16, 2018 After this video went viral, Arhan wrote a lengthy post on his Instagram account reprimanding Virat and Anushka
 arhan ne likhaa tha- disclemur: apane is post se mujhe shoharat paane kii koi ichha nahin he
 He further wrote - Horrible! i casually threw a small piece of plastic while driving
 paas se guzar rahi ek car kii khidki neeche hoti he
 Out of that, Anushka Sharma shouted like a roadside man
 main apni laaparvaahee ke liye maafee maangata hum, lekin anoushka sharma kii shabdon main agar thodaa tahjeeb hoti to usase wo choti star nahin ho jaatin
 There are many types of manners and cleanliness - one of them is the tone of conversation
 viraat ko airport chhodane ain anoushka, gale lagaakar kiya vidamere lagjri car se jo kooda galati se baahar gir gaya tha wo aapke munh se nikle kooday se bahut kam tha
 
 
 From your luxury car window
 
 
 yaa viraat kohli ke chote dimag se, jinhone ise shoot kar ke online post kiya
 This is the biggest waste
 Disclaimer: i have no desire to gain any mileage from this post of mine
 
 
 Horrible! So i happened to carelessly Litter a sq mm of plastic while driving! a car passing by rolls their window down and there we have our wonderful @anushkasharma ranting and yelling like a crazy roadside person! While I'm apologetic for my carelessness, Mrs Anushka Sharma Kohli a little etiquette and politeness in ur dialogue wouldn't have made ua lesser star !! There are all kinds of manners and hygiene
 
 verbal etiquette is one of them! The garbage that mistakenly went out of the window of my "luxury car"
 
 
 Was way less then the garbage that came out from your mouth
 
 
 From ur "luxury car's" window
 
 
 Or the trashy mind @virat
 kohli to shoot and post this online
 
 
 For whatever gains
 
 
 Now thats some serious trash !!! a post shared byarhhan Singh (@arhhansingh) onjun 16, 2018 at 7:05 am PDT After this, Arhaan's mother also expressed displeasure over Virat and Anushka writing a post on their Instagram
 unka kahana tha ki viraat ne unke bete kaa cheharaa dhundhala naa kar unke maan-sammaan par thes pahunchaai he
 He wrote - Anushka Sharma and Virat Kohli, in the name of cleanliness, we do not want publicity by your cheap stunt
 aap donon ne gopneeyata ke adhikaar kaa hanan karte hue apane phens or folbers ke ek video share kiya or video or apane post contate main mere bete ko sharminda kiya
 Whatever you are in your field through millions of followers and PR, whether you get money to campaign or you do all this for publicity
 
 
 bataur maa main yah bataanaa chaahati hum ki aapane mere bete arhan singh kaa cheharaa dhundhala naa kar ke naa sirf use soshal media par sharminda kiya he balki uske liye khatra bhi paidaa kar diya he
 i am concerned for my son's safety
 KBC ke registration main poocha gaya viraat-anoushka kii jindagi se judaa ye sawalapaki himamt kaise hui kisi kii chhavi, manobal or pratishtha ko chot pahunchane kii
 The boy is about to start his new venture
 khud ko acha naagarik sabit karne ke liye or apni fain folowing badhaane ke liye aapane aisa kiya
 How dare you? If both of you were equally concerned about cleanliness, then you would definitely do something about the dirt spread in your street
 aapako apane ilaake ke municipal adhikariyon ke saamne isaki aawaaj uthaani chahie thi, jo aapane nahin kii
 If you had good intentions, you would have explained it well to spread the garbage
 
 
 naa hi aisa ashisht or abhimaani bartaav karte or phir duniya ko dikhaane ke liye use soshal media par post karte
 @anushkasharma @virat
 kohli The last thing we would want is to get publicity out of your cheap STUNT in the name of CLEANLINESS! You both posted a video for your fans n followers by VIOLATING Basic Rights to privacy &you shamed my son in the video as well in your post content you both may be who you are in your fields, with millions of followers & all the PR backing you
 
 
 you may be paid for your campaigning or maybe doing it for sheer publicity as a mother, i would like to state that you have not only shamed my son @arhhansingh on social media by not blurring his face, but youve also exposed him to unwanted hostility 
 
 
 
 and danger from fanatics for such a small thing that you claim he has done but have no proof of anyways? i am concerned about my sons SAFTEY !!! how dare you crush somebody's image / and morale and reputation and expose him to public hate, a boy who is on the verge of starting his ventures,
 
 just to prove what good citizens you both are to increase your fan following? How dare you ?? If you both really cared or bothered about cleanliness, then you would actively do something about all the garbage in your own lane
 
 you would make a noise and use your VOICE to urge the municipal authorities to take action atleast in the lane where you live, to start with, which you haven't
 Posting videos of fake bravado just to fool your followers
 If your intention was genuine then you would pull over and politely correct the person for littering IF THEY DID in a decent and real manner
 
 
 and not by displaying such a rude and arrogant attitude, and then posting it for the world to see! You have caused a lot of grief with your post & this is morally and humanitarianly very wrong
 You may be # anushkasharma or # viraatkohli in your house or on screen & the field
 
 
 but on the streets you are just a citizen trying to correct another
 
 
 DO IT WITH KINDNESS
 
 
 
 fear karma
 And just FYI , he did not react badly, not coz of who you both are
 
 we couldnt care less,but only because he has a decent upbringing ! Unlike people like you, who seem to think that you are the empowered ones to talk and treat people as you wish !A post shared bygittanjali(@gittanjali
 elizabeth_singh) onjun 16, 2018 at 12:19 pm PDT You have hurt a lot from your post and it is human and morally wrong
 aap apane ghar, screen yaa field par bhale hi anoushka sharma yaa viraat kohli hai, lekin sadak par aap aam naagarik hai, jo dusron ko sudhaarney kii koshish kar rahe hai
 
 
 Be kind

 For your information, let me also say that he (arhan) did not give you the wrong answer

 If the treatment of schizophrenia, the most serious disorder of mental illness, is not treated, about 25 percent of the patients are at risk of committing suicide

 dilli se sate gajiabad main ek ladki kaa madrase ke andar ek maulavee ke dwaara kathith yon shoshan ke maamle par kendriya mantri giriraaj singh ne sawaal uthaaya he
 He has said that when supporters of Mohammed Ali Jinnah used to take to the streets and burn candles in the case of Kathua gang rape, why is he silent about this matter today? Giriraj said that Jinnah's supporters are plotting to divide the country
 vahiin duusari taraf congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi dwaara vande maataram raashtragit kaa sammaan nahin karne ko lekar giriraaj singh ne kaha ki unki maansikta bhi em ai em mukhiya asaduddin ovaisi ke jaisi he kyonki vah bhi rashtriya geet or raashtragan kaa sammaan nahin karte hai
 Giriraj Singh said that people have made a whole conspiracy to divide this country
 kuch log jinna ke pratinidhi banakar jab desh main kathua maamla hota he to log usamen dharmik sampradaay or dharmik unmaad dekha jaataa he or ek hi baar shaharon main log tii-shart pahanakar dikhaai dete hai
 He said that where the tears of people go missing and their candles are lost when a girl is raped in a madrasa
 pataa nahin logon kii jubaan kyon band ho jaati he, naa bahes hoti he or naa road par nikalate hai
 This is a fatal indicator for the country
 giriraaj ne kaha ki aise log galatfahami main naa rahen ki unki jubaan tagdi jubaan he or baakiyon kii chup jubaan he
 i would like to request that those who are supporters of Jinnah should support themselves
 bharat main unke samarthan ke mansoobey kabhi puure nahin honge
 He said that people like Rahul Gandhi sit down when the national anthem or national anthem is played
 mujhe to lagata he rashtriya geet or rashtriya gaan kii jo bhaavana em ai em mukhiya ovaisi ke andar dikhti he vahi bhaavana mujhe rahul gandhi ke andar bhi dikhti he
 Asaduddin Owaisi never respects the national anthem and i see a similarity in the mindset of Asaduddin Owaisi and Rahul Gandhi to this day

 17veen shatabdi main bana mughal shaasha shahjahan kii shikargah samay ke saath-saath bhaison kaa tabela ban chuki he
 It was built by the Mughal ruler Shah Jahan in Jonti village in outer Delhi about 400 years ago for his own comfort, but Shah Jahan would never have imagined that the hunting ground where he is going to rest easy is transformed into a cow buffalo dome
 Will go
 ji haa, ye he bahari dilli kaa wo jonty gaanv jahaan kabhi mughal shaasha shikaar karne ke baad apni sena or raniyon ke saath aaraam karne jate the
 But with the changing times, this hunting ground has been transformed into a buffalo these days
 kya he vajahadrasal iske peeche kii mukhya vajah ye he ki aaj tak kisi kaa dhyaan is shikargah par nahin gaya, jiske chalate ye shikargah ab il-legal kabje kii bhent chadhati ja rahi he or shikargah kii viraasat vilupt hoti ja rahi he
 The villagers say that the Kishikargah is spread in about 4 acres of land and after the Mughal ruler left here, the villagers started living inside this hunting ground
 samay ke saath- saath aabaadi badhati gai or gaanvvaale shikargah ko dinodin gherte rahe
 Now after so many years, Alam is that the villagers have started taking possession not only around it but also inside the shikargah and now the cows of the villagers thrive in this hunting ground
 khastahal hoti ja rahi shikargah kii haalat400 saal pehle basaai gai is shikargah kii haalat dinon din khasta hoti ja rahi he
 Also, sometimes a brick falls here and sometimes debris, which is becoming a problem for the people living around it
 shikargah kii is haalat par gaanvvaalon ke saath- saath prashasan bhi chintit he
 The administration wants it to be brought as a legacy, but whenever the administration took any step, it faced many problems, whether villagers or courts
 ye hai pareshaaniyandrasal shikargah kaa vikaas naa hone kii mukhya vajah shikargah ke aasapaas gaanvvaalon kaa basaa hona he
 The villagers say that they have settled here for a long time, which they also have paper documents
 court ne bhi ise jaij tehraate hue, in gaanvvaalon ko legal qaraar diya he
 Now the villagers want this hunting ground to be developed and their village must be a tourist place, for which they are willing to give their home as well, but the problem for the administration is how and where to shift them
 kaise hoga vikasstate orcyology vibhaag ke head vikaas maalu ke mutabik shikargah ke pun: vikaas ke liye gaanvvaale to unke saath hai lekin unke liye sabase badi chunaiti he ki in gaanvvaalon ko kahin or shift kiye bina is heritage ko develop karne kii
 For this, the Department of State Archeology and Art and Culture Department and the Department of Archeology Survey of India jointly made a plan for its development, on which work will start soon
 shikargah kii khasta haalat he use behatar kiya jaae saath hi shikargah ke paas bane talab ko bhi viksit kiya jaae
 Because this pond is also of Shah Jahan's time where queens used to come to take water
 jald hi iskaa development kiya jayega or bahut jaldi is talab main tourist ke liye boat bhi chalaai jaaegi

 People are more spiritual in the morning and hence at this time they are involved in activities like worship
 ek nae adhyayan main yah baat saamne ai he
 Researchers at the University of Connecticut said that when people are busy with work, their tendency towards spirituality is lowest
 sangeet sunate, padhate yaa kasarat karte vakt bhi logon menaadhyatm ke prati jaagruktaadhik hoti he
 Badrlee R
, assistant professor of sociology and co-author of the study
 i
 Wright said, 'the most amazing thing is that people's spiritual awareness varies throughout the day and at work
 ' kaam karte vakt aadhyatmik jaagrukta kam hoti he
 It is the lowest among people obsessed with work
 iske alaava, yah baat bhi saamne ai he ki samachar dekhne vaale log na dekhne waalon kii tulana main adhik aadhyatmik hote hai
 There is a complex interaction between spiritual awareness and circumstances
 unhone kaha, 'kabhi-kabhi halaat aapaki aadhyatmik jaagrukta ko prabhavit karte hai, to kabhi-kabhi aapaki aadhyatmik jaagrukta aapke halaat ko prabhavit karti he

 -input IANS Bharatiya Janata Party MP Sakshi Maharaj has once again made a controversial statement
 unhone musalamaanon kii nasbandi or unke matadhikaar chhine jane kii maang kii vakaalat kii he
 At the same time commenting on the facilities provided to Muslims, he said, 'appeasement has ruined the country
 ab desh main modi yug aa chukaa he
 Therefore the politics of appeasement will no longer work
 'sakshi maharaj ne kaha, 'is desh main ek jati vishesh kii ladki ko wajipha diya jaataa he
 Taxes are levied in Hindu temples
 vahiin duusare logon ko yatra karne main bhi chhot di jaati he
 Now this politics of appeasement will not be allowed at all
 ' unhone shivasena ke mukhpatr 'saamana' menmusalamaanon se matadhikaar chhinane kii maangako jaij tehraaya he
 Sakshi Maharaj has demanded such a stringent law for family planning which should be uniform for people of all castes, religions
 unhone kaha, 'parivaar niyojan bharat sarkaar kaa upkram he
 Hindus are also being sterilized
 agar musalmaan nahin kara rahe he to main nahin kahata ki musalmaan or isaayiyon kii karvaa do
 But there should be a law in the country which is one for all
 kyonki desh kii badhati hui jansankhya chintaa kaa vishay he
 The BJP MP has appealed to the parties and the opposition that together they should formulate a strong family planning law which will be followed by all
 or us kanoon kaa paalan naa karne waalon se sajaa ke taur par vot dene kaa adhikaar chin liye jane kaa praavdhaan ho
 Significantly, the Hindu Mahasabha's national vice-president, Sadhvi Deva Thakur, has spoken about sterilization of Muslims to stop the growing population
 sakshi ne aarakshan ko bhi galat tehraate hue kaha, 'ram vilaas paswan ho yaa khud sakshi maharaj, aarakshan kii jarurat nahin he
 Therefore, it needs to be considered
 aage chalakar sarkaar ko is disha main kadam uthaanaa hi padegaa
 'are Sakshi Maharaj constantly creating problems for the Modi government with his statements vah agar tufaan ke pehle kii khamoshi thi, to tufaan aane ke baad ehsaas hua ki us khamoshi ke peeche kya raaj tha
 It is being talked about by Tamil Nadu Chief Minister j Jayalalithaa, who finally broke her silence on the development model of Narendra Modi and Gujarat
 isi tarah, pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee or uttar pradesh kii purv mukhyamantri mayawati ne bhi modi par tikhe hamale bolne shuru kar die hai
 Known as the three 'goddesses' of politics, these three tall women leaders have tried to put a stop to the speculation that they can go with the BJP after the elections, but is it really so? ediemke supremeo, tamilnadu kii mukhyamantri je jayalalita or narendra modi kii mitrataa jagajaahir he
 In fact, since the Gujarat riots, politics has been isolated and has been under attack by opposition parties, if anyone other than Shiv Sena and Akali Dal extended their hand to Narendra Modi, it was Jayalalithaa
 hindutv ke muddon par jayalalita bijepi ke behad kareeb hai
 In such a situation, the relationship between Narendra Modi and Jayalalitha, the poster boy of Hindutva, is cordial
 ye nazadikiyaan tab bhi spasht hoti raheen, jab donon hi netaa ek-duusare ko chunavi jeet par badhai dete rahe
 In 2011, Modi took part in Jayalalithaa's swearing-in ceremony, while in 2012, Jayalalithaa sent her representation at Modi's swearing-in ceremony
 yah mana gaya ki endie ke vistaar main sabase pehle koi agar bijepi ke saath aayega, to vah jayalalita hi hongi, par aisa hua nahin
 Now Narendra Modi is campaigning in Tamil Nadu
 modi ke prati rajya main samarthan bad rahaa he
 The BJP has tried to carve out its own place in the traditional AIADMK-DMK fight in the state by forming a third front with five parties
 dmdike ke vijayakaanth jaise majboot sahyogi ke saath bijepi gathbandhan rajya main tisare vikalp ke rup main ubharta dikh rahaa he, isiilie jayalalita ne modi par hamalaa bolaa he
 By doing this, she wants to take Muslim votes with her
 isi ke liye shaayad unhone na to bijepi ke saath chunaav purv gathbandhan kiya or na hi is bare main koi sanket diya
 It is for sure that by breaking alliances with the left parties, they have kept their options open for the future
 mamata banerjee ke saath unki dosti majboot ho rahi he
 Perhaps it is also necessary for him to bolster his ambition to become Prime Minister as the leader of the alternative front in the event of no single coalition getting majority
 pashchim bengal main bhi kuch aisa hi ho rahaa he
 Mamta Banerjee has been involved in the Vajpayee government
 rajya main unki virdohi left partiyaan kahati hai ki chunaav ke baad mamata, modi ke saath ja sakati hai
 Like Jayalalithaa, Mamata is also concerned about Muslim votes
 rajya ke matadaataaon main modi ke prati utsukata dekhne ko mili he
 According to an assessment, if the percentage of votes received by the BJP goes above 20, then it can do a lot of damage to the Trinamool Congress
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki mamata ko modi par khulkar hamalaa bolne ke liye majaboor hona padaa he
 While Mayawati's strategy is very interesting and mysterious
 raajnneetik jaankaar hairaan hai ki uttar pradesh main mayawati, modi par us tikhe andaaj main hamale kyon nahin kar rahi hai, jiske liye vah jaani jaati hai
 The bsp's lack of alliance with the Congress has been the best news for the BJP in Uttar Pradesh
 pashchimi uttar pradesh main hue matdaan ke baad bijepi yah daawa bhi kar rahi he ki vahaan paramparaagat rup se mayawati kaa samarthan karne vaale jatav vot bank main bhi use send lagane main kamyaabi mili he
 Mayawati's own failure to contest the Lok Sabha elections is also raising many questions
 bijepi chaahe saarvajanik rup se kahe ki rajya main uskaa pramukh muqabla samaajawaadee party nahin, balki bispi se he, lekin jameen par aisa hota dikh nahin rahaa he
 On the ground, the SP is seen to be competing with the BJP and that is why the Muslim votes are being divided instead of polarized
 haalanki muslim matadaataaon ko aashwast karne ke liye mayawati kahati rahi hai ki chunaav ke baad bijepi ke saath gathbandhan karne kaa sawaal hi paidaa nahin hota
 These stanzas of Mamta, Mayawati and Jayalalitha are before the elections
 raajnneeti main na to koi sthai shatru hota he or na hi mitra
 There is no reason to believe that if the NDA stays away from the majority and needs support to reach the magical figure of 272, then it will look towards these three powerful women leaders
 par shaayad sarkaar ke sthayitv ko sunishchit karne kii yah kavayad kargar sabit na ho
 Especially given the attitude of these three leaders during the Vajpayee government
 lekin yah tay he ki aise halaat banane par inaki ek badi bhoomika jarur hogi
 The current tensions between India and Pakistan also overshadowed the 56-year-old Indus Water Treaty today when India clarified that 'mutual trust and cooperation' is crucial to the working of such a treaty
 sarkaar kii ore se yah bayaan us vakt aayaa he jab bharat main aisi maang uthi he ki uri hamale ke baad pakistan par dabaav banane ke liye is jal bantwaare samjhaute ko khatm kiya jaae
 Asked whether the government would reconsider the Indus Water Treaty in view of the increasing tension between the two countries, Vikas Swaroop, a spokesman for the Ministry of External Affairs, said, "it is important for work on such a treaty that the mutual agreement between the two sides There should be cooperation and trust
 '' saath hi unhone yah bhi kaha ki sandhi kii prastaavna main yah kaha gaya he ki yah 'sadbhaavna' par aadhaarit he
 Then when asked if India will end this treaty, they did not give any details and just said that everything is not mentioned in diplomacy and they did not say that this treaty is not working
 is sandhi ke tahat beas, raavi, satluj, sindhu, chenab or jhelum nadiyon ke pani kaa donon deshon ke bich bantwaaraa hoga
 The treaty was signed in September 1960 by Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and President of Pakistan Ayub Khan
 pakistan yah shikaayat karata aa rahaa he ki use paryaapt pani nahin mil rahaa he or vah kuch maamalon main antarrashtriya madhyasthata ke liye bhi aage gaya he

 ) Uttar Pradesh Electricity Department has been continuously in the limelight for some time over the wrong bill
 taaja maamla hapur sthit chamari gaanv kaa he
 The electricity department handed over a bill of Rs 128 crore to an elderly person living here
 khaas baat to yah he ki peedit ko jo bill diya gaya he usamen maheene main mahaj do kilowat bijli istemaal karne kii baat kahi gai he
 The aggrieved elderly has been circling the power department (UP Electricity Department) for the past few days to fix this wrong bill but no one is helping him
 eenai se baatcheet main samim main ne kaha ki hamaari baat koi bhi nahin sun rahaa he
 Where can we deposit such a huge amount? ham jab is bill ko lekar shikaayat karaane gaye to hamen kaha gaya ki agar hamanen bijli bill nahin bharaa to hamaara conection bhi kaat diya jayega
 Shamim alleged that it seems that the electricity department has issued the bill for the entire city in the name of my house
 unhone bataaya ki abhi tak mere ghar kaa bill 700 se 800 rupee ke bich aata tha
 In Shamim told that i only run one bulb and one fan in my house
 ab ek balb or pankhe kaa bill itnaa kaise aa saktaa he
 Significantly, this is not the first time that the UP Electricity Department has given a fake bill to someone
 isse pehle isi saal janvari menvibhag (UP Electricity Department)ne ek yuvak ko uske ghar main istemaal kii ja rahi bijli ke liye 23 karod rupee kaa bill dhama diya tha
 The special thing is that the UP Electricity Department has clearly written in its bill that 178 units were consumed in the young man's house during this period
 yah puraa maamla upi ke kannauj jile kaa tha
 The victim Abdul Basit has reported the matter to the department
 abdul basit ne kaha tha ki mujhe lag rahaa he ki bijli vibhaag (UP Electricity Department) ne mujhe puure uttar pradesh kaa bill thama diya he
 Basit said that even if i continue to give my earnings to the department even at my age, i will not be able to pay these bills till death
 bataa den ki vibhaag ne basit ko 23,67,71,524 rupee kaa bill diya tha
 In a special conversation with ANI, the engineer of the power department, Shahdab Ahmed said that we will soon correct this bill and give it to them
 unhone bataaya tha ki reeding main ai kuch gadabadiyon kii vajah se is tarah ke bill jenerate ho jate hai
 We will check the reading of their house once again and based on that they will be given a new bill
 isse pehle aisa hi ek maamla chhattisgarh se bhi saamne aayaa tha
 Where the electricity department had sent a bill of Rs 75 crore to a wage-earning woman for her one-room house
 sanvvaadadaata ne jab isaki shikaayat chhattisgarh state power distribution company limited ke prabandh nideshak ke pie courian philip se kii thi, to unhone kaha tha ki aisa galati se ho gaya he
 You get me the BP number, i will get it fixed right now
 pie sahab is bill ko to sudhaar lenge, magar bill dekhakar yadi kisi kaa dil baith gaya or jaan chali gai to! kai jagah aisi ghatana ho chuki he
 This was the case of Bhaisma village in Korba district, where Sarita Yadav, a resident, lived and worked hard
 uske ek chote se makaan main do pankhe chalate theore do balb lage the
 But Sarita got shocked when she got one month electricity bill of Rs 75,00,00,000

 Inaugurating the India Today Mind Rocks Summit 2012, India Today Group editor-in-chief Arun Puri said, “when we last met there was a smell of revolution in the air
 bhrashtachar ke khilaaf ladaai bas ek kanoon kii duuri par tha, hamaari arthvyavastha acchhee tarah aage bad rahi thi
 Although many scams were exposed, but still the faith in the government and administration was intact
 lekin aaj hamaari vikaas dar girti ja rahi he or saath hi hamaare yahaan naukariyon ke avasar bhi kam hote ja rahe hai
 The desire to become our global power has become like a joke
 ab aapke saamne aisi paristhitiyaan hai ki ek rajya kaa vyakti duusare rajya main bina dare nahin rah saktaa
 Today, the smell of corruption is widespread all over the country
 har jagah ghotaale najar aate hai
 Illegal politicians, devious bureaucrats and sly businessmen have consistently raped the country
 ham rus se alag nahin hai jahaan rajya pryojit poonjeevaad saamaanya he
 Referring to today's newspapers, he said that leaving Colgate there are two more small reports which show how rotten our system is
 ek khabar he dilli kii 895 avaidh coloniyon ko niyamit karne kii
 Do you know that there are more than 50 lakh people living in these illegal colonies who should not have been there
 ye singapore yaa norge jaise deshon kii aabaadi ke baraabar he
 He said that when these colonies were being formed, what were our institutions doing which were responsible for them
 ye sab emsidi adhikariyon, police or sthaneey netaaon kii mileebhagat se hua he
 'we do not punish wrongdoing, but celebrate it
 ' or ham sab jaanate hai ki in coloniyon ko kyon niyamit kiya ja rahaa he
 The second news is even more shocking
 supreme court ke anusaar bellari se 50 lakh ton se zyada louh ayask kaa naa keval avaidh khanan hua balki vahaan se 400 kilometre dur sthit ek bandargah se iskaa niryaat bhi kar diya gaya
 To do this, at least 5 lakh rounds of trucks would be required
 kya aap kalpana kar sakate hai ki itane bade paimaane par ye kaam hua to bhrashtachar kitni gaharaai tak pahunch chukaa he
 Is this the India we wanted? i do not think so
 kya isse aapako gussa nahin aata? mujhe yakeen he ki aap khud ko is duniya ke naagarik maanate honge or duniya main kahin bhi kaam karnaa chahenge
 There is no limit to your dreams and hopes
 agar aapako koi naukari nahin milti yaa phir aapaki naukari chhot jaati he to aap koi nayaa kaarobaar karne kii sochane lagenge
 All i mean to say is that you are all optimistic, multi taskers, interested in new technology, giving results, enjoying diversity and challenges
 aaplogon ko bas ek anukool maahaul chahie jisase aapaki urja or srujanaatmakataa ko sahi disha mil sake
 You want your voice to be heard as well
 aaj jo sabase badi samasya yah he ki is desh kii raajnneeti or rajaneta yuvaaon se puri tarah se cat gaye hai
 Today those people are ruling over us who think less about what India can become
 duusare deshon ke netaaon par najar daaliye
 When Barack Obama became the President of the United States, he was 47 and if he is elected again, he will be 51 years old
 britain ke pradhanmantri 46 varsh ke hai
 Even China, where age is given due importance, both future leaders of President Xi Jin Ping and Prime Minister Li Keqiang will be 57 and 59 respectively when they take over in October

 We also need youth in administration
 hamaare pradhanmantri kii umr 80 saal he or unka swasthya bhi bahut acha nahin he or hamaari cabinet kii ausat umr 65 varsh he jabaki hamaare desh kii aus umr 25 saal he
 i am sure that the youth will bring change in this country, so the youth should not be disappointed with the current circumstances
 abhi bhi ummid baaki he

 The Uttarakhand government announced a CBCID inquiry into the death of Sadhu Nigamananda of the Mother House in Haridwar
 rajya ke paryaton mantri madan kowshik ne samvaadadaataaon se baatcheet main kaha ki sarkaar nigamanand kii maut se jude sabhi maamalon kii sibisiaidi se jaanch karaayegi or puure tathy kii jaankaree hasil karne ke liye gaharaai tak jaayegi taaki doodh kaa doodh or pani kaa pani ho sake
 Kaushik said that the government had broken the fast of Swami Shivanand, the head of the Mother House, on the issue of sand mining in the Ganges, and the government fully agreed with him on the issue of purity and purity of the Ganges and mining in the Ganges was stopped
 
 unhone kaha ki swami nigamanand dwaara anshan ke dauraan unke ilaaj ke liye pehle sarkaar ne unhen haridwar ke aspataal main bhartee karaayaa tha or uske baad unhen jaaligrant sthit himalayan aspataal main bhartee karaayaa gaya tha
 The minister said that not only him but the entire party is sad over Nigamananda's death but those who are doing politics on his death should not do so
 rajya ke paryaton mantri kowshik ne kaha ki jahaan tak nigamanand ko jehar dene ke aarope kaa sawaal he to yah saare maamle jaanch ke dauraan ujagar ho jaayenge
 In this, the government will work with complete transparency
 ek sawaal ke jawaab ne unhone kaha ki matrusadan ke paramadhyaksh swami shivanand kii ore se yadi sarkaar se likhit rup se is puure maamle main paardarshita ke liye koi bhi aagrah kiya jaayegaa to us par sarkaar vichaar karegi
 When asked that Shivanand has demanded a post-mortem of Nigamananda's body again, he said that after examining the legality of this work, action will be taken by the government as much as possible
 unhone kaha ki swami nigamanand kii maut kaa mudda koi rajnatik nahin he
 No Congress leader has even gone to see Nigamanand till today and politics has been started on his death
 mantri ne kaha ki haridwar ke aspataal se lekar himalayan aspataal tak bhaajapa sarkaar ke hi logon ne nigamanand kii dekharekh kii thi
 When he was told that Shivanand had demanded a CBI inquiry into the entire matter, he said that a discussion will be held with the Chief Minister in this regard
 sarkaar ne sibisiaidi jaanch kii ghoshnaa kar di he

 Congress leaders have started brainstorming on the Congress defeats in Gujarat and Himachal
 congress netaa kamalnath ne kaha ki bijepi daawa kar thi ki unki dedh sau siten aaengi, lekin bijepi kii siten usase kam ai hai
 However, he admitted that the Congress organization was weak
 chunaav nattejey aane ke baad kamalnath ne kaha, 'gujarat bijepi kaa garh he, pradhanmantri kaa grih kshetra he
 bjp's tally has declined in this
 yah sabit karata he ki desh main kya halaat hai
 Whatever big claims the BJP was making, questions of development, of various schemes have been raised
 kisi ke upar vishwaas nahin he
 Weak Kamal Nath, an organization in cities, said, 'I believe that the Congress was weak, especially in the urban area
 hamaara sanghathan shahari kshetra main kamjor tha
 These results prove that the Congress needs to strengthen the organization in urban areas
 bijepi gujarat main kevalshahari kshetronmen jiti he
 On not questioning Rahul's leadership, at the first defeat under the chairmanship of Rahul, Kamal Nath said, "I do not believe it has happened, but some work needs to be done in our organization
" gujarat main hamaara sanghathan majboot nahin tha, lekin iske baavjood bijepi ke siton kii sankhya kam hui he
 Then Sanjay Nirupam, the head of EVM Ragamumbai Congress, has again chanted the EVM
 unhone daawa kiya ki gujarat main bhaajapa kii jeet rajya ke logon ke kaaran nahin balki iviem ke kaaran hui he
 He also said that electronic voting machines are a major threat to Indian democracy
 gujarat main congress party prabharee ashok gahalot ne bhi kaha ki chunaav kaa parinaam chaahe kuch bhi rahe, lekin desh kii janata ye maan rahi he ki jeet congress kii hi maani jaaegi
 He said that it is necessary to remove the apprehension about evms

 For this, the government will amend sections 2 and 3 of the Public Premises (eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Act 1971
 is act main sanshodhan ke jariye awasaiya accomodation kii paribhaasha or use khaali karaane ke praavdhaanon ko nae sire se paribhaashit kiya gaya he
 After amendment in the law, the officers of the director estate will have the right to start the process of evacuating the bungalow after the expiry of the fixed limit of staying in the government house
 diarector estate zarurat ke mutabik kar sakegaa poochtachadiarector estate zarurat ke mutabik sarkari awaas ko khaali karaane ko lekar sidhe sambandhit vyakti se poochtacha kar sakenge
 For this, there will be no need to follow the long and elaborate process under the old rules
 sarkari awaas main rahane kii samay seemaa khatm hone par diarector estate ke adhikari bangala khaali karne kaa aadesh bhi de sakate hai
 Not only this, if anyone does not obey this order, the help of the police can be taken to vacate the bungalow
 haivi finelia ja saktaa he
 In fact, the Modi government had a lot of trouble with the ministers, mps and Chief Ministers of Congress-ruled states in the UPA government to vacate the government bungalow
 jaise ambika soni, adhiranjan choudhary, harish ravat, umr abdulla jaise netaaon se unka bangala khaali karaane main modi sarkaar ke shahari vikaas mantri vankaiya naidu ke paseene chhot gaye the
 Rabri Devi, the wife of Rashtriya Janata Dal President Lalu Prasad Yadav and former Chief Minister of Bihar, has given a befitting reply to the statement of Union Minister and senior BJP leader Ashwini Choubey, in which she advised Rabri Devi to stay in the veil
 saath hi rabari devi ne ashvini choube ke bayaan ko mahilaon kaa apmaan bataate hue pradhanmantri narendra modi par bhi nishaanaa saadhaa
 On Rabri Devi's Choubey, the national vice-president of RJD, Rabri Devi said to Ashwini Chaubey, 'if you stay in the veil, it is better
 bijepi kaa naaraa he ‘beti bachaao, beti padhaao’ lekin betiyon kaa aisa apmaan? yah sabhi mahilaon ke liye apmanjanak he
 i want to ask them if they will ask women leaders in the BJP to stay in the veil, and at home? '' bjp's slogan is "beti Bachao," Beti Padhao "but such insult of daughters? It's insulting towards all women

 Rabri said in the video, 'choubeji you should tell the people of the country what is the problem with you getting out of the veil of women and getting involved in social life

 aam chunaav kii tazaa khabaron se apadet rahane ke liesbscrib karenajatak kaa ellection special newzlator People say that times are difficult to meet, but Narendra Modi is proving this saying wrong
 bharat kii saamaajik-aarthik gananaa modi ke liye aisa avasar lekar ai he, jo shaayad unako mili janadesh se bhi zyada bada he
 Assessments of the poor and failure of social security experiments already existed in most of the country's population
 taaja surveykshan ne in aakalnon ko aankadon kaa thos aadhaar dete hue modi sarkaar ko, puure aarthik-saamaajik niti niyojan ko badalane kaa anokhaa mauka saunp diya he
 This survey has bridged the biggest shortcoming of the policy planning framework
 bharat dashakon se apane logon kii kamai ke adhikrut aankade yani ek inkam data kii baat joh rahaa tha, jo har aarthik faisle ke liye anivaary he
 Here it is necessary to know the five major results of the socio-economic survey that will affect policies and politics: (1) Seven out of ten people live in villages in India, (2) 30 percent people are dependent on farming and 51 percent people are only laborers
 (3) In villages, the highest earning member in every family of four in five has a maximum income of Rs
 5,000
 prati maah he
 That is, the per capita income in a family of five members is one thousand per month
 se bhi kam he, (4) 56 fisad gramin bhoomihin hai, (5) 36 fisadi gramin nirakshar hai
 Only three percent of people are graduates
 (dekhen isi ank main 'kaise pichad gaya india main bharat') ye aankade keval gramin aabaadi kii aarthik sthiti bataate hai
 The urban part of this survey is yet to be released
 jo shaayad yah batayega ki shaharon main based 11 karod pariwaron main 35 lakh pariwaron ke paas aay kaa koi saadhan nahin he
 The Rural and Urban (unofficial) Economic Survey has three major findings
 pehla, desh kii 70 fisadi aabaadi gramin he
 Secondly, about 90 percent of the population including cities and villages is such that only 200 to 250 rupees
 prati din par guzaara karti he, or teesraa bharat main madhya varg keval 11 karod logon kaa he jinke paas ek surakshit niyamit aay he
 After this data, no one will believe that the time has come to change the foundation of the formation of policies in the country, which will begin by changing the parameters which are the basis of all economic-social policies
 desh main garibi kii paimaaish badale bina ab kaam nahin chalegaa kyonki in aankadon ne sabit kiya he ki bharat main garibi pichhali sabhi gananaaon se zyada he
 Consumption surveys, calculating inflation, accounting of employment, social security are needed
 formule bhi nae sire se tay honge
 In the light of this figure, the assessment of the reduction of inequality in India (guinea coefcient), which has been done on the basis of consumption, will also change
 in paimaanon ko badalte hi sarkari nitiyaan ek nirnaayak prasthaan bindu par khadi dikhaai dengi
 Socio-economic census data prove why MNREGA programs in India bring political success
 How do Raman Singh, Naveen Patnaik or Jayalalithaa remain cheap and successful with the help of cheap food, while the voters do not mind the success of industrial investment and infrastructure
 alabatta aankade yah bhi bataate hai ki loklubhaavan nitiyon kaa dhaancha sirf logon ko jinda rakh saktaa he, unki jindagi behatar nahin kar saktaa
 If these data are examined in parallel to the impact of economic reforms on the economy, perhaps a new path of policies will be felt, which will change the entire gamut of development, major reforms of governance, use of technologies, balanced open market and New schemes will be coined
 garibi kii raajnneeti yakeenan buree he lekin jab 90 fisadi logon ke paas aay suraksha hi na ho to rojgaar yaa bhojan dene vaali skiimon ke bina kaam nahin chalata
 In such a situation, new ways of providing social security will have to be found and jobs will have to be taken out of seasonal and temporary levels and taken to permanent
 aap pichley chah dashak kii gramin badahaali ko lekar congress ko kosne main apana vakt barbaad kar sakate hai lekin sach yah he ki in aankadon ke saamne aane kaa yah sabase sahi vakt he
 If these figures had come under Congress rule, then populism would have seen its peak
 centre main ab aisi sarkaar he jo ateet kaa boj uthaane ke liye baadhya nahin he
 It has a chance to revive the chemistry of policies in India
 saamaajik-aarthik surveykshan or puraane tajurbe taakid karte hai ki desh ko nitiyon va skiimon ke baari makadzaal kii jarurat nahin he
 Equipped with infallible technology, monitoring, coordination with the states, and three big social programs are enough, which can be realized by running parallel to the open and balanced market
 satta main aane ke baad pradhanmantri ne ye aankade dekhe hote to na keval unki nitiyon or kaaryakramon kaa diene badal gaya hota balki bijepi kaa rajnatik samvaad bhi sire se tabdeel ho janaa chahie tha
 200 as per the survey
 se 250 ru
 Bank accounts, insured Jan Dhan Yojana is almost meaningless for most of the daily population
 mek in india, digital india yaa is tarah ke anya kaarykram adhiktam das fisadi logon ko prabhavit kar sakate hai
 This is the reason why the Modi government's mission and schemes have not seen the impact of 90 per cent of the daily wage laborers and most of them in under-educated and uneducated India
 modi kii nitiyon kaa pani utre, usase pehle desh kii saamaajik-aarthik hakeekat unke haath main he
 In light of these figures, they can initiate a new beginning of policies and governance, as they have been chosen by the people only for new beginnings, not for new shades of past

 co / mqsu6wrqoz The Trinamool Congress led by West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and TDP of Chandrababu Naidu can also play a role in government formation at the Center
 mamata banerjee or chandrababu naidu bhaajapa-virdohi gathbandhan banane kii koshish karte rahe hai or yahaan tak ki is koshish main unhone congress se bhi meljol rakhaa
 However, with Mamata Banerjee being a strong attacker on the BJP, she has also been targeting the Congress, which has also responded equally
 basapa or sapa jahaan bhaajapa kii kadi ninda karte rahe hai, vahiin ve congress ko apane chunaav purv gathbandhan se baahar rakhkar use mahatvaheen darshaate rahe hai
 These regional parties can win close to 180 out of 543 Lok Sabha seats and the number of seats they will win in this election will determine their role
 trishanku sansad kai sambhaavnaaen paidaa karegi or gaiyr-congressi or gaiyr-bhaajapa kheme aisi hi sthiti chahenge
 Jaganmohan Reddy said earlier this month that he hoped to have a hung parliament, so that he would be able to reach a better compromise for the state
 makkal nidhi maiyam (emenem) ke netaa camel hasan ne bhi kaha he ki loksabhaa chunaav trishanku sansad kii sthiti paidaa karenge or tisare morche kii sarkaar bane isaki sambhaavna he
 According to a pre-poll poll conducted by the Center for Study of Developing Societies (CSDS), the BJP may lose seats due to 'more united opposition' in major states despite an increase in vote share
 surveykshan main bhaajapa ko 222 se 232 ke bich siten milane kaa anumaan jataayaa gaya he, jo ki 2014 main uske dwaara jiti gai 283 siton se kaaphi kam he
 The pre-poll poll shows that the Congress party can win 74–84 seats, having won only 44 seats in 2014
 surveykshan ke anusaar, rashtriya janatantric gathbandhan bahumat ke aankade tak pahunch bhi sakati he or nahin bhi or use 263 se 283 ke bich siten milane kii sambhaavna he
 The United Progressive Alliance (UPA) is expected to get 115 to 135 seats
 madhya march main jari kiye gaye surveykshan main kaha gaya tha ki rajg ko 264 siten milane kii sambhaavna he, jo ki sarkaar banane ke liye jaruri 272 ke aankade se aath siten kam he
 In this survey, the Congress-led UPA was projected to get only 141 seats
 kuch surveykshanon main rajg ko bahumat milane kii bhavishyavaanee bhi kii gai he
 There is also talk of the formation of a federal front before the elections and Rao also held meetings with non-bjp and non-nda parties before the election
 aise prayaas chunaav ke baad or tej ho sakate hai
 If there is a possibility of formation of a third front, then some partners of BJP and Congress can also join it

 The central government has decided not to appeal against the decision of the Bombay High Court in the transfer pricing case involving Vodafone
 kendriya mantrimandal kii baithak ke baad sutron ne yah jaankaree di
 The case relates to the price charged when transferring shares of the Indian entity of Wadaphone to its parent company in the UK
 hoicourt ne faisla diya tha ki is maamle main vodaphone par 3200 karod rupee kii dendar nahin banati
 Now the government has decided that it will not appeal against the decision of the Bombay High Court in the Vodafone case
 vodaphone maamle main apil nahin karne kaa faisla atorni general mukul rohtagi kii raay ke baad kiya gaya he
 Rohatgi had advised the Income Tax Department to accept the decision of the Bombay High Court in the Vodafone case
 gauratlab he ki hoicourt ne 10 oktober, 2014 ko apane aadesh main mobile seva company vodaphone ko badi raahat dete hue kaha ki vah transfar prising se jude maamle main 3200 karod rupee ke tex kii dendar nahin he
 The Income Tax Department accused the company of undervaluing the shares of its entity Vodafone while transferring them to a parent company in the UK
 vibhaag ne company se atirikt iskar kii maang kii thi
 This transaction of shares took place in FY 2010
 vodaphone ne iskar vibhaag ke aadesh ko chunauti dete hue 27 janvari ko bombai hoicourt kaa darwaja khatkhataya tha
 --- from input language aam nagarikon or sarkaar ke liye bhi phydemand mana jane vaala guds and services tex (jiesti) sanshodhan bill buudhvaar ko rajyasabha main paas ho gaya
 Voting on the bill took place late in the evening after an 8-hour-long discussion in the Upper House
 sanshodhan bill ke paksh main 203 vot pade, jabaki jayalalita kii party ediemke ne voting main hissaa nahin liya
 After passing the bill, Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted and thanked all the parties and their members
 vahiin vitt mantri arun jetali ne bill ke paas hone ke baad kek katkar khushiyaan manaai
 Earlier he had put the amended bill on the floor of the House
 unhone jiesti ko beete ek dashak kaa sabase mahatvapurn kar sudhaar qaraar diya
 Jaitley said that India will be transformed into a similar market with GST
 unhone kaha ki rajyasabha ne jiesti bill ko silect cameti ko saunpa tha
 In most parties, this bill has been agreed
 unhone kaha ki isse desh main bada badlaav aayega
 Jaitley said that they are grateful to all the parties
 itnaa hi nahin jetali ne congress netaa gulam nabi aajad kaa bhi shukriya adaa kiya
 i would like to add that GST will also be the best example of cooperative federalism
 Together we will take India to new heights of progress— Narendra Modi (@narendramodi)august 3, 2016I also thank media, intellectuals, economists and members of civil society for creating an enabling environment for the passage of # gstbill
 - Amit Shah (@amitshah) August 3, 2016I congratulate PM Sh @ narendramodiand FM Sh @ arunjaitelyfor creating wide consensus on # gstbillthat will benefit all including poor
 — Amit Shah (@amitshah)august 3, 2016duusari taraf tamilnadu kii siem jayalalita kii party AIADMK ne jiesti bill main 6 sanshodhan karne kaa prastaav dene kaa faisla kiya he
 Ghulam Nabi said- Congress will help the government, Ghulam Nabi Azad said that he will help the government on GST
 aaazaad ne kaha tha ki unki party or netaaon ne jo sanshodhan sujhaaye the, use bill main shaamil kar liya gaya he
 So now they will support it
 chidambaram ne kaha- 'swaagat karte hai'purv vitt mantri pi chidambaram congress kii taraf se rajyasabha main jiesti bill par apana paksh rakh rahe the
 They said that they welcome this bill
 unhone kaha ki beete kuch hafton main bill ko lekar sarkaar ke rukh main badlaav aayaa he
 Therefore, Congress welcomes this bill
 jarur padhein: in 20 baton se jaane GST sanshodhan bill par kisne-kya kaha?jiesti lagu hone par puure desh main ek tex niyam lagu ho jayega
 Currently, people have to pay 30 to 35 percent tax
 lekin jiesti lagu ho jane se logon ko lagbhag iskaa aadha yani 17 se 18 fisadi tak hi tex dena padegaa
 With the introduction of GST, excise tax, service tax, VAT, sales tax, entertainment tax and luxury tax will be abolished
 in bade badlaavon ke baad congress kii madad kii ummid1
 There will be no one percent additional tax in the business between the states
 2
 If the states suffer losses due to GST, the central government will give 100 percent compensation for 5 years
 aise banegaa kanoonjiesti vidheyak beete saal loksabhaa main paarit ho chukaa he
 Now, even after passing the Rajya Sabha, it needs the approval of the assemblies of at least 15 states
 yah manjuuri milane ke baad bill ko raashtrapati ke paas bheja jayega
 The bill will become law after the President's signature
 haalanki iske baad centre sarkaar ko centre or rajya ke liye jiesti se jude kanoon banane honge
 The foundation of GST was laid by the Vajpayee government, it is worth mentioning that the foundation of GST was laid by the Vajpayee government 16 years ago
 360 degree main ghumte hue buudhvaar ko rajyasabha main paas hone kii ummid he, kyonki 16 saal pehle vaajapeyi sarkaar alpamat main thi to pesh nahin kar saki or saal 2009 main manmohan sarkaar ne koshish kii, to gaiyr-congressi shasit rajyon ne virodh kar diya
 Now that the BJP has majority governments at the Center and most states, the Modi government softened its stance to take the Congress along in the Rajya Sabha
 jiske baad congress se sahmati ban gai
 Expecting benefit from GST to common man: Every country will get its benefit as soon as a tax scheme is implemented in the country
 iske lagu hote hi 20 se zyada indiarect tex khatm honge or sirf teen tarah ke (central, state or integrated jiesti) tex hi lagenge
 Central government will levy Central GST tax
 state jiesti tex rajya sarkaar vasuulegi, or integrated jiesti ko kendra rajya donon vasuulenge, kyonki ye do rajyon ke bich kaarobaar hone par lagegaa
 If some things are cheap, then some are expensive too
 The question will be in every mind that what will be cheap and what will be expensive with the implementation of GST? Eating in restaurants, consumer durables such as air condition, microwaves, machinery goods and freight will be cheaper, while canned food products, tea, coffee, mobile bills, credit card bills, jewelery and textiles will become expensive
 jiestilagu hone se growth rate main ijapha sambhavajiesti lagu hone ke baad do se teen baras tak mahangaai bad bhi sakati he

 kinnaron ne ek adalati cese ko lekar maang kii he ki isaki sunwaayee mahila court main nahin honi chahie
 This case should be transferred to another court
 chennai ke 11 kinnaron ke ek group par 19 saal ke ek ladke kaa apharan karne or jabaran sex change oparation karwaane kaa aapraadhik maamla mahila court main chal rahaa he
 These eunuchs have now filed a petition demanding that the case be transferred to another court
 in kinnar aropiyon ne apni yachika main kaha he ki ve na to purush hai or na hi mahilaayein, isliye unke liye ek special court kaa gathan kiya janaa chahie
 In 2009, 19-year-old Vinod was kidnapped by these eunuchs and in this case, the Crime Branch Criminal Investigation Department (CBCID) of Tamil Nadu arrested 11 eunuchs and later charged them
 ab in kinnaron ne apni taaja yachika main kaha he ki jis samay ke aarope un par hai, tab vinod ek purush tha isliye ye cese kisi anya court main transfar hona chahie or vahiin trial hona chahie
 However, in response to this, CBCID has stated that although Vinod had symptoms similar to women, he was not willing to undergo an operation to change sex
 parantu aropiyon ne jabaran uskaa oparation kar diya gaya
 Along with this petition, many ngos working for transgenders have been alerted
 chennai main transgenders main echivi sambandhi masalon ke liye kaam karne vaale enjio indian community welfare orgenijesh (ICWO) ke sachiv e je hariharan kaa is babat kahana he ki saamaanya taur par transgenders ko mahilaon kii tarah treet kiya jaataa he or is yachika se main hairaan hum
 Nevertheless, this matter has to be carefully looked into and discussed
 vahiin, kinnar samudaay ke log is yachika ke saath khadey najar aa rahe hai
 He argues that men can understand their problems well
 is maamle main jo aaropee banaae gaye hai, unhen mahila court se nyaay nahin mil saktaa
 a transgender activist, p Sudha, says that since transgenders are very few in number, special courts cannot be created for them, but their cases should run perfume from women's courts

 ambikapur ke bare main
 
 
 Ambikapur, one of the largest cities in Chhattisgarh, is considered a very important seat for the assembly elections
 kyonki pichley do chunaavon main bhale hi bhartiya janata party bahumat ke saath rajya kii satta hasil karne main kaamyaab rahi ho, lekin ambikapur main vah jeet kaa swaad nahin chakh pai
 Ambikapur assembly seat in Surguja district is one of the oldest cities in Chhattisgarh
 chhattisgarh main rail connectovity, bade skool, anya chijen maujuud hai
 But this area is mostly dependent on agriculture, about 40% of the area of ambikapur belongs to agriculture

 Despite the BJP getting three seats less than in 2008, they formed their government with an absolute majority

 In Chhattisgarh, the controversy over 'eggs' has deepened these days
 mid de mile main bacchon ko anda parosa jaae yaa nahin, is sawaal par paksh or vipaksh sadan se lekar sadak tak bhid gaye hai
 BJP leader Dharamlal Kaushik categorically said, "the Congress government of the state is plotting to move the state from vegetarian to non-vegetarian through the use of eggs in food
" unka kahana tha ki rajya main 'kabir panthi' or 'gayatri parivaar' jaisi sansthaaen hai
 He has a large number of followers
 aise main andey ko bacchon ke khaane main shaamil karnaa ek bade samudaay kii bhaawanaaon ko aahat karne jaisaa hoga
 He also argued that even if the Congress is saying that children who do not have to eat eggs will be given other nutritious things
 lekin aise main pankti main baithe shaakaahaari bachche anda khaane vaale bacchon ko dekhakar ‘anda’ khaane ke liye prerit honge
 In fact, the Congress government in the state was asked to include eggs in the mid-day meal distributed in schools to fight malnutrition
 tabhi se yah vivaad khadaa ho gaya he
 The Congress, however, issued an explanation on 16 July, seeing the controversy deepening
 isamen skool shiksha vibhaag ne skulon main shaala cameti yani skool vikaas samitiyon ko do hafte ke andar bacchon ke abhibhavakon ke saath baithkkar andey ke prayog ko lekar unka rukh pataa lagane ko kaha he
 In this explanation, it is suggested to sit in a separate row of egg-eating children
 saath hi jin skulon main abhibhavak andey ke istemaal sahamat nahin hote to vahaan par jo bachche khaanaa chahenge unhen ghar par hi andey bheje jane kii bhi baat kahi gai he
 After a meeting within two weeks, some permanent guidelines will be issued in this matter
 lekin bhaajapa netaa dharmalaal kowshik is spashtikaran ko bhi ek sajeesh qaraar dete hai
 He says that the meetings between the development committees and parents in the school will be just a ritual
 vahaan par faisla vahi liya jayega jo sattashin sarkaar chaahegi
 But the BJP will stand against this decision
 bhaajapa sarkaar to pehle bacchon ko anda khilaa chuki he, phir ab kyon etrajagariyaaband jile ke ek anganbari centre kii sahayika ne naam na bataane kii shart par kaha, '' 2014 se 2015 ke bich kendron main kuposhit bacchon ke liye gud, chanaa or anda khilaane kaa aadesh aayaa tha
 Under this campaign, the districts where the number of very malnourished children was more
 12-12 din ke sneh shivi lagaae gaye the
 All this was given to the children in it
 ''17 jilon ke atikuposhit bachche kha chuke hai andekorba, gariyaaband, balaudabazar, baalod, bemetara, bastar, durg, kawardha, mahasamund, dantewada, bijapur, jashpur, sukama, kanker, raipur, kondagaanv, narayanpur
 There is also ban on onion, garlic in these schools, forget the egg, NGO 'akshaya Patra' distributes mid-day meal meal among 13,139 children from 175 schools in Chhattisgarh
 chhattisgarh main ‘akshay paatr’ main mid-de mile vitaran main bataur food quality or sefti adhikari ke rup main kaam kar rahe vikaas yadav ne bataaya, ‘‘ ham khaane main lahasun-pyaaj istemaal nahin karte
 However, take full care of nutrition
 khansama sthaneey str kaa hi niyukt kiya jaataa he taaki vah sthaneey swaad ke anusaar khaanaa banaae
 On the question of eggs, he says that i do not know anything about this dispute, nor do we have any information about it
 yah poochne par ki kya sarkari aadesh aane par unhen mid-de-mile main anda shaamil karne kii anumati unke adhikari denge? ve kehete hai, ‘‘ sawaal hi nahin uthta, haalanki hamaara prabandhan hamaari pareint argenigeshan (scon) se bilkul alag he
 But it is a religious institution
 darasal ‘scon’ ke tahat hi akshay paatr foundation kaam karata he
 Therefore, eggs cannot be allowed to be included in food
 ’’ spasht he ki rajya main agar abhibhavak skool vikaas samiti ke bich baithak main andey ko mid-de-mile main shaamil karne par sahmati ban bhi jaati he to bhi rajya ke kareeb 13 hajaar bacchon ko anda mil hi nahin saktaa
 Earlier in Karnataka, the dispute also came up in Karnataka, when the government there sent a notice to the NGO Akshay Patra asking them to use onion-garlic in the mid-day meal
 lekin akshay paatr ne jawaab main kaha tha, ‘‘ kichan main satvik bhojan banataa he
 Food is offered to God first
 aise main khaane main pyaaj lahasun istemaal nahin kiya ja saktaa
 "mid-day meal is distributed only through mid-day meal in 15,668 schools across the country
 aise main kam hi ummid he ki kam se kam in bacchon ko to anda hi nahin balki lahasun, pyaaj bhi naseeb nahin hoga

 3
 jab rajasthan ke shahar jodhpur ghoomane gai or vahaan jaakar block print valilong skirtpahanakar ghoomane nikali to kai mahilaon ko ghaghara pahane dekha jo meri skirt jaisaa hi tha
 Even then i did not feel isolated
 4
 In Manali, Himachal Pradesh, i felt like being one of them when that black skirt was matching the woolen skirts (dohdu) of those local women
 5
 i used to feel completely normal wearing a skirt while sitting on a scooty with all the cousins at the clock tower of Meerut at night
 6
 In Saharanpur, we often go to eat Gulshan's ice cream only after 10 pm
 kai baar lanbaa intjaar karnaa padataa he meri hi tarah kai or ladkiyaan skirt pahane vahaan line main khadi najar aati hai
