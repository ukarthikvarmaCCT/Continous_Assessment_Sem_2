 a little time changed, even hours were spent waiting for their turn at the telephone booth
 phir dekhte hi dekhte mobile ne sari duniya muththi main laakar kab rakh di pataa hi nahin chalaa
 This saga of change has always been written with technical ink
 ab 4G iskaa aglaa padaav he jo aapaki duniyaan puri tarah se badal degaa
 Now you aajtak
 in par ek khabar se duusari khabar tak jane ke liye apni palkon tak ke jhapakanen kaa intjaar nahin karnaa padegaa
 This is how your world will change
 
 
 kya hai ye 'G' kaa jhamela?2g, 3G or 4G main aane vaale 'G' se matlab mobile takneekee kii jenereshan se he
 Just as the new generation is considered faster than the older generation, 4G is also faster than its older generation technologies (3G, 2G, 1G)
 internet seva main pehali donon peedi 1G or 2G kaa naata analog se he vanhi 3G or 4G digital duniya kii takneekee he
 So what does 4G mean? 4G is the fourth generation of wireless service
 3G takanic main OFDMA (orthogonal frequency divijan multiple acces) kii sahaayta se network kii suvidha ko or behatar banaaya jaataa he
 4G will be a fully IP based service
 isamen wais, data or multimedia ko samaan gati se bheja or risive kiya ja sakegaa
 How much better than 3G? To say, 3G has all the facilities that have the potential to change a lot in the world of technology
 par 4G kaa koi jawaab nahin
 The speed of 4G is 100 to 300 Mbps which is 50 times more than 3G
 3G ke mukaable 4G kaa data rate zyada he yani data kaa transfar tej gati se kiya ja saktaa he
 Also, the price of this technology is also expected to be lower than 3G, because with the arrival of 4G, consumption is also being projected to increase more than double
 3G takanic jahaan wide aria network par kaam karti he, vanhi 4G local aria network (LAN) or base stesan wide aria network par kaam karti he
 4G Vs
 3G ?speed:3g : adhiktam 3
 1 Mbps and 1 on average 300 Kbps
 5 mbps4g : amuman 2-40 Mbps par 100 se 300 Mbps tak badhaaye jane kii kshamta
 Maximum upload speed: 3G: 5 Mbps up to 4G: 500 Mbps Maximum download speed: 3G: 100 Mbps up to 4 G: 1 Gbps What are the biggest advantages of 4G? Users will be able to easily access audio and video of high quality
 - OFDMA (orthogonal frequency divijan multiple acces) kii vajah se aap behtareen quality (720p or 1080p) ke video kaa bina kisi rukawat ke luft uthaa sakenge
 - With the increase in speed with the arrival of 4G, it will be uniform
 matlab ye ki aapke phone se jitani data kii demand kii jaaegi utani hi baraabar speed main aapako mil sakegi
 The issue is that if you watch any video on youtube with Facebook, the speed decreases but it will not happen with the arrival of 4G
 - video kaling ke dauraan koi bhi rukaawat dekhne ko nahin milegi

 However, the entire nation is eyeing this serious issue
 ajinkya rahane ko bangladesh ke khilaaf vanade muqaabale main emes dhoni ne bhale drop kiya ho, lekin beete do saal ke unke pradarshan kaa aakhirkaar unhen inaam mil hi gaya
 Rahane, 27, has been named captain of Team India for the tour of Zimbabwe
 cricket kariyar main pehali baar rahane ko kisi badi team kii captaini kaa mauka mila he or wo bhi sidhe team india kii team he
 Ajinkya Rahane has scored 839 runs in the last one year, including two centuries in 25 odis, but during this time he has emerged as a very reliable batsman
 test maichon main bhi ve bharat kii ore se khaase kaamyaab ballebaaz rahe hai
 He has scored three Test centuries and all three on foreign pitches
 rahane ko zimbabwe daure ke liye mili captaini kii sabase badi vajah to yahi he ki chah senior khilaadiyon ko aaraam die jane ke baad rahane maujuuda team ke aise khilaadi dikhaai dete hai, jinako lekar chayankarta bhavishya kaa daanv khel sakate the
 Chief selector Sandeep Patil has also said that Rahane's performance has been very good in the last two years
 tippaniyan Although senior players like Harbhajan Singh and Murali Vijay are present in the team, but Murali Vijay has not been able to become a permanent member of the ODI team so far while Harbhajan Singh is returning to the ODI team after four years
 aise main chayankartaaon ke saamne rahane se behatar vikalp nahin ho saktaa tha
 Apart from this, Rahane has developed himself as a match cricketer in a very short time
 mushkil samay main rahane khud par par niyantran rakhana bakhubi jaanate hai
 In such a situation, he will have to prove his ability as a captain on the tour of Zimbabwe
 27 saal ke rahane ko zimbabwe daure ke liye team india kaa captain banaaya gaya he
 For the first time in a cricket career, Rahane has got the chance to captain a big team and he is also the team of Team India directly
 ajinkya rahane ne beete ek saal ke dauraan 25 vanade maichon main do shatak sahit 839 ran banaae hai, lekin is dauraan ve bade hi bharosemand ballebaaz banakar ubhare hai
 He has also been a very successful batsman for India in Test matches
 unhone teen test shatak banaae hai or teenon videshi pichon par
 The biggest reason for Rahane's captaincy for the Zimbabwe tour is that after resting six senior players, Rahane appears to be the players of the current team for whom the selectors could play the bets of the future
 mukhya chayankarta sandip patil ne bhi kaha he ki rahane kaa pradarshan beete do saalon main bahut acha rahaa he
 The comments vaise team main harbhajan singh or murali vijay jaise senior khilaadi jarur maujuud hai, lekin murali vijay ab tak vanade team ke sthaayee sadsy nahin ban paae hai jabaki harbhajan singh chaar saal baad vanade team main vaapasi kar rahe hai
 In such a situation, there could not be a better option than Rahane in front of the selectors
 iske alaava rahane ne khud ko behad kam samay main maior cricketer ke taur par viksit kiya he
 Rahane knows how to control himself in difficult times
 aise main zimbabwe daure par unhen ek captain ke taur par khud kii kaabiliyat sabit kerani hogi
 Ajinkya Rahane has scored 839 runs in the last one year, including two centuries in 25 odis, but during this time he has emerged as a very reliable batsman

 First question: At what time did the police reach the spot and what was happening when they reached the spot? Police said that they had received information at 12:40 pm
 aise main subah ke 4:00 baje ghayal rakabar khan ko lekar aspataal kyon gai?2
 Second question: The distance from the incident to the hospital is only 6 kilometers, so did the journey of 6 kilometers take 4 hours? 3
 teesraa sawaal:rakabar khan kii aspataal main saaf-suthra pahunchaa
 While the police itself is saying that he was stained with mud
 gaadi main baitaane se pehle rakabar khan ko police ne nahalaaya tha taaki gaadi gandi nahin ho?4
 Fourth question: BJP mlas themselves are raising the question that in order to please the public, the police also started beating Rakbar Khan with the public
 isamen kitni sachai he?5
 Fifth question: Eyewitnesses who were present on the spot say that Rakbar was in the police station after the incident
 to kya subah tak rakabar khan ko koi ilaaj nahin mila?6
 Sixth question: Did the police deliver the cow to Goshala first and Rakbar Khan to the hospital later? 7
 saatvaan sawaal:dspi ne rakabar khan ko gotskar qaraar de diya tha
 That is, 4 hours after the incident, Rakbar Khan was considered an accused by the police
 8
 Eighth question: The BJP MLA had said that our workers had beaten up a bit, after that the police also beat him
 to kya maarane walebijapi kaaryakartathe?9
 Ninth question: Why has the police not reached the accused despite the passing of the day? 10
 dasvaan sawaal:police jaanch se pehle hi rajasthan ke grahamantri police ko clin chit de rahe hai
 How to trust the investigation on this? It is noteworthy that in the Alwar village of Ramgarh police station area in Alwar, some alleged guards were beaten by a person named Rakbar Khan in the case of cow smuggling
 jiske baad vahaan police pahunchi thi or baad main aspataal pahunchane se pehle hi uski maut ho gai thi
 Congress General Secretary Digvijay Singh said that Rahul Gandhi will come in a big role in national politics and the party's command will definitely be in the hands of the younger generation from the older generation
 disambar main congress mahadhiveshan main apni team banane ke liye rahul gandhi kii jamkar tarif karne vaale singh ne haalanki is baat par kuch bhi spasht nahin kaha ki rahul kab tak apni is bhoomika main saamne aaenge

" unhone kaha ki aisa hona tay he
 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar may stand with the central government on the issue of demonetisation, but it is also not hidden from anyone that his allies, especially the Rashtriya Janata Dal and the Congress Party, do not agree with him on this issue
 iskaa ek jeeta jaagta udhaaharan ravivaar ko dekhne ko mila jab centre sarkaar dwaara yojit diji dhan mela main bihar ke shiksha mantri ashok choudhary ne bhari sabha main kendriya mantri radhamohan singh ko is mudde par khari-khoti suna di
 Ashok Chaudhary is also the President of Bihar Congress and IT Minister of Bihar
 do din pehle notebandi se aam logon ko ho rahi pareshaaniyon ke maddenjar vah patna main dharne par bhi baithe the
 When Ashok Chaudhary came to give a speech after Union Agriculture Minister Radhamohan Singh at a conference held in Patna with a view to increase awareness among the common people to promote digital payments across the country, he started by calling Radha Mohan Singh as his guardian But after this, he attacked the central government
 choudhary darasal radhamohan singh ke bhaashan main bihar kii vidhi vyavastha par kiye gaye vyangy par palatwaar karnaa chaahate the
 He said that this is the kind of digital age in which e-payment is being promoted by holding the neck of the people
 bihar sarkaar ke kisi mantri ne pehali baar kisi saarvajanik manch se centre par digital bhugtan ko lekar hamalaa bolaa he
 In his speech, Chaudhary asked why Transaction Tax is being charged? He questioned how digital payments can be carried among the common people in a state which lacks banks in 500 panchayats and only 70 branches are open despite the Reserve Bank's target of opening 1700 new branches
 choudhary ne is maukey par shiksha vibhaag ko mil rahi kendriya sahaayta main katautee kaa bhi zikr kiya or kaha ki shiksha vibhaag ke bajet main katautee kar desh main digital yug nahin laayaa ja saktaa
 The comments haalanki radhamohan singh pehle hi bol chuke the, lekin baad main ashok choudhary ke bhaashan par pratikriya dete hue unhone kaha ki aisi party (congress) ke log unase sawaal puch rahe he, jinhone centre main 60 varshon tak raaj kiya he
 The Union Minister also said that Ashok Chaudhary has described the plight of the country by his own party
 haalanki radhamohan singh ne yah bhi mana ki chunki choudhary apni party ke line ke anusaar bol rahe hai, isliye yah koi aashcharya kii baat nahin he
 Meanwhile, the Janata Dal does not seem to be in any hurried mood for its review meeting on United Demonetisation
 party netaaon kii maane to abhi nitish kumaar kalchakra puja, nishchay yatra ke baad 21 janvari ko nasbandi par yojit maanav shrinkhalaa kii taiyaari main vyast hai
 The party believes that the problems people are suffering from demonetisation have reduced
 ashok choudhary bihar congress ke adhyaksh bhi hai or bihar ke iti mantri bhi hai
 He was also sitting on a dharna in Patna in view of the problems faced by the common people due to demonetisation two days ago
 puure desh main digital bhugtan ko badhaava dene ke liye aam logon ke bich jaagrukta badhaane ke makasad se patna main yojit sammelan main kendriya krishi mantri radhamohan singh ke baad jab ashok choudhary bhaashan dene pahunche, to shuruyaat to unhone radha mohan singh ko apana abhibhavak bataate hue kiya lekin iske baad unhone centre sarkaar par karaara hamalaa bol diya
 In fact, Chaudhary wanted to reverse the satire on Bihar's legal system in Radha Mohan Singh's speech
 unhone kaha ki ye kaisaa digital yug he, jisamen logon kii gardan pakadakar i-pement ko badhaava diya ja rahaa he
 For the first time, a minister in the Bihar government has attacked the Center over digital payments from a public platform
 choudhary ne apane bhaashan main poocha ki aakhir tranjaction tex kyon liya ja rahaa he? unhone sawaal kiya ki jis rajya main 500 panchayat main bainkon kaa abhaav he or rigerv bank dwaara 1700 nae branch kholane ke lakshya ke baavjood maatr 70 branch khule hai, waisi haalat main digital pement ko aam logon ke bich kaise le jaaya ja saktaa he
 On this occasion, Chaudhary also mentioned the reduction in central assistance being received by the education department and said that the digital age cannot be brought in the country by cutting the budget of the education department
 tippaniyan Though Radhamohan Singh had already spoken, later, reacting to Ashok Chaudhary's speech, he said that people of such party (congress) are asking questions to those who have ruled the center for 60 years
 kendriya mantri ne yah bhi kaha ki ashok choudhary ne apni hi party dwaara desh kii kya durdasha kii gai he, uskaa bakhaan kiya he
 However, Radhamohan Singh also believed that since Chaudhary is speaking according to his party's line, it is no surprise
 is bich janata dal united notebandi par apni samiksha baithak ko lekar philhal kisi jaldbaaji ke mood main nahin dikhti
 According to the party leaders, right now Nitish Kumar is busy preparing for a human series on vasectomy organized on January 21 after Kalachakra Puja, Nischay Yatra
 party maanati he ki notebandi se logon ko ho rahi pareshaani main ab kami ai he

 sunil gavaskar kii 1971 se 1986 tak pandrah saal main lords par paanch test match khilne ke baavjood jab cricket ke makka par shatak jamaane kii hasarat puri nahin ho pai to apni muraad puri karne ke liye vah shesh vishwa ekadash kii team kaa hissaa ban gaye the
 In August 1987, Gavaskar fulfilled his wish by scoring 188 runs in the first innings of the match played between Rest of the World and MCC XI
 ab bharat ke ek or little master sachin tendulkar kii baari he jo bhale hi antarrashtriya cricket main shatakon kaa shatak jadne ke behad kareeb hai lekin lords main unhone ab tak ardhashatak tak nahin jadaa he or sirf tendulkar hi nahin balki england daure par gai bharat kii vartmaan team kaa koi bhi khilaadi cricket ke makka par abhi tak saikadaa nahin jad paaya he
 Rahul Dravid started his Test career at this ground but then he was dismissed after scoring 95 runs
 vivies lakshmana kaa is maidan par ausat 57
 00 but his highest score is also 74 runs
 virendra sahvaag or captain mahendra singh dhoni bhi is maidan par khele hai lekin vah bhi shatak se maharoom rahe hai
 Yuvraj Singh and Gautam Gambhir have not played Test matches on Lord's, while in ODI international cricket no Indian has scored a century on Lord's so far
 sabase pehle baat karte hai tendulkar kii
 The star batsman has played four Test matches at Lord's from 1990 to 2007 but his highest score in this is 37 runs
 unhone in chaar match main 21
 Has scored 149 runs at an average of 28
 unhone lords par jo teen van de match khele hai unamem vah keval 45 ran hi bana paae
 Dravid had played his first Test match at Lord's in 1996
 saatven number par ballebaaji karte hue jab vah 95 ran par khel rahe the tabhi unhone wicketiper ko kaich thama diya tha
 This was the same match in which Sourav Ganguly also started his Test career with a strong knock of 131 runs
 dravid ne iske baad yahaan jo chaar anya paariyaan kheli unamem unka score 46, 63, do or nau ran rahaa
 Even in four odis, Dravid could not score a century here
 lakshmana ko england kii dharti par hi nahin is team ke khilaaf bhi pehle shatak kaa intjaar he
 As far as the Lords are concerned, the veri-vari Special has scored 43, 74, 15 and 39 runs in four innings on this ground
 lords par ek van de main vah nau ran hi bana paae
 Dhoni played a Test match here in 2007
 uski pehali pari main vah shunya par ludhak gaye jabaki duusari pari main 76 ran banaakar naabad rahe
 Sehwag will not play in the first Test match starting July 21 and thus he will have to wait to score a century on cricket's Mecca
 sahvaag ne lords par ek match khelaa he jisamen unka ucchtam score 84 ran rahaa he
 As far as centuries on Lord's are concerned, then how can we forget the name of Dilip Vengsarkar, who set a new world record by scoring three centuries in three consecutive series on this ground
 unhone lords par bharat kii taraf se sarvaadhik 508 ran bhi banaae hai
 Even Ajit Agarkar has the distinction of scoring a Test century on Lords
 inke alaava vinu mankad, gundappa vishwanath, mohammad ajaharuddin, ravi shastri or saurav ganguli ne bhi lords par shatak jamaaye hai
 If we talk about one-day international cricket, no batsman has scored a century on Lord's from India yet
 van de main yahaan kisi bhartiya kaa sarvaadhik score 90 ran he jo ganguli ke naam par darj he

 wo ek serial repist he ye to pehle hi pataa chal chukaa tha
 But along with being a serial rapist, he is also a psycho rapist, it has now been revealed
 aisa koi or nahin balki maamle kii jaanch kar rahi police kaa kahana he
 Perhaps you will not believe it, but it is true that the person who carried out the incident like the cab rape scandal still has no regrets over his actions
 balki wo to ye kah rahaa he ki ladkiyaan us par marati hai, kyonki wo kaamdev he
 The person whose actions rocked the entire country
 jisaki ek karatuut ne rajdhani main mahilaon kii hifaazat par nae sire se bahes kii shuruyaat kar di
 On whose action, the anger of the people from the road to the Parliament kept on spreading
 jiske chalate cab companiyon kii shamat aa gai
 Due to which the Commissioner of Delhi Police was summoned to the Ministry of Home Affairs and due to which the Home Minister himself had to make a statement in both the Houses of Parliament
 vahi shaks ab jab bol rahaa he, to sun kar police bhi hairaan ho rahi he
 Because he still has no regrets over his actions and neither realizes how wrong what he did was wrong
 dilli police kii maane to teen din ke poochtacha main usne apni cab main savaar hone vaali ladki ke saath balaatkaar karne kii baat to kubul kar lee
 But at the same time it also surprised that after that night, how did the girl write a report to the police? If sources are to be believed, Yadav said that till date no girl has ever asked him for a relationship, because she is very smart, handsome and good looking
 usne yahaan tak kaha ki wo jis ladki ke bhi kareeb aane kii koshish karata he, wo khud ko khushkismat maanati he
 Because he is a living cupid
 jis shaks ke sir par ek nahin, balki serial repist hone kii tohamat chaspaan ho chuki ho, uski in baton ko sunakar kuch der ke liye police bhi hakki-bakki rah gai
 The officers questioning him now do not understand that this boast of Yadav is actually a sign of his mind getting spoiled or whether he is trying to confuse the police by proving himself to be a psycho or a lunatic by talking such things
 
 haalanki ab tak hui poochtacha par jaaen to police bhi use ab serial repist ke saath-saath ek psyco cese maan kar chal rahi he
 But the police also need to get the opinion of many experts before declaring her as sick
 poochtacha main saamne ai baton par jaaen to yadav ne ladki ko apane paas 15-20 cab hone kii baat bhi kahi thi or kaha tha ki ye sari texiyaan ubar cab ke saath chalati hai
 And he earns a lot of money
 police sutron kii maane to chehre or body language kii baat chhodie, shiv kumaar yadav ne ladki ke saath jyaadati kiye jane ke kisi tarah kaa afsos naa hone kii do took baat bhi kahi he
 It is said that the hands of law are very long, but every time Shiv Kumar Yadav escaped from these long hands
 wo to ab uske jurmon kaa bahi-khaataa khul rahaa he to sach pataa chal rahaa he
 And the truth is that the way Shiv Kumar Yadav survived every time he committed a crime, he got encouraged
 or kanoon kaa dar uske dil se jaataa rahaa
 And on seeing this he became a serial rapist
 lekin ab police uske gunahon par phulstop lagaana chaahati he
 That is why this time evidence is being gathered against him from Mathura to Delhi and from Delhi to New Jersey
 dilli cab rape cond ke mulgim shiv kumaar yadav se hui teen dinon kii poochtacha or tafteesh ke baad ab uske khilaaf itane subut ikattha ho chuke hai ki vardiwaalon ko yakeen he ki is baar ye psyco repist itani aasaani se salaakhon se baahar nahin aa sakegaa
 The police have not only gathered many important forensic evidences to lock Shiv Kumar Yadav in a big house for a long time, but have also talked to a girl living in New Jersey, USA, with whom Shiv Kumar Yadav has misbehaved
 Had
 police kii maane to tab is ladki ne ubar cab company se yadav kii shikaayat kii thi
 But despite this, the company did not pay any special attention to this complaint
 ravivaar shaam ko mathura main kareeb paune kilometre tak daud kar peechha karne ke baad yadav ko giraftaar karanevaali dilli police use raat ko hi lekar dilli aa pahunchi thi
 After this, the police took him on remand for three days after presenting him in Tis Hazari Court on Monday
 police ko giraftaar ke vakt hi vaardaat main istemaal kii gai cab yani swift diajar car to haath lag gai thi
 But many things like the clothes and mobile phone worn by the accused during the incident were yet to be recovered
 lihaaja, yadav ko hiraasat main lekar jaise hi police apane par ai yadav vaardaat kii tamaam kadiyon ko khud ba khud jodta chalaa gaya
 After this, the police recovered the mobile phone along with his clothes, which Shiv Kumar Yadav always kept with him
 darasal, ubar ke ap samet yphone ubar company kii ore se yadav ko diya gaya tha
 On friday-saturday night, after committing the crime, Shiv Kumar switched off his I-phone to cheat the police
 pehle to wo is koshish main wo kaaphi had tak kaamyaab bhi rahaa, lekin jald hi police ko uske do or mobile phone kaa pataa chal gaya
 And then it was captured due to technical surveillance as well as intelligence input
 tafteesh ke dauraan naa sirf yadav ke kai puraane gunahon kaa kaccha-chittha saamne aa gaya
 It was also clear that he had got two driving licenses
 haalanki baad main police ko pataa chalaa ki inamen se ek linces farzi he
 Therefore, now the police have started investigating the rape as well as the fraud cases against Yadav
 ye baat bhi saaf hui ki shiv kumaar yadav ne dilli police kaa ek farji kairactor certificate bhi hasil kiya tha
 Police suspect that on the basis of this fake certificate, he must have got a driving license
 aise main police yadav ke saath-saath us transport othority ke adhikariyon ke role ko bhi samajhane kii koshish kar rahi he
 Police claim that many evidence has been found from his cab and clothes, which will act as a nail in Yadav's coffin
 is bich shiv kumaar yadav ko teen dinon ke remand ke baad guuruuvaar ko court main pesh kiya gaya or vahaan se 24 disambar tak ke liye use jail bhej diya gaya
 However, separate security arrangements have been made for him in the jail in view of the rage in the case and the beating of the accused in the 16 December case
 guuruuvaar ko police ne adaalat ko ye bhi bataaya ki usne kis tarah farjivade se do linces hasil kiye
 On this, the court asked for action against the Transport Authority as well
 jaahir he, ab police is maamle main jald se jald chargeshit bhi daakhil karnaa chaahati he
 So that Shiv Kumar can be brought to its end
 paanch balaatkaar, chhedchhad, gunda act, arms act or naa jane kya-kya
 The list of convictions of Delhi-based cab driver Shiv Kumar Yadav is very long
 kuch itani lambii ki ab dilli se lekar mainpuri or mainpuri se lekar america tak uske sataae hue logon kii ek lambii list he
 But our system is no less amazing that despite being so much, he used to come out every time to carry out a new crime
 shiv kumaar yadav kii ye pahchaan beshak ab jamaane ke saamne ai ho, lekin hakeekat yahi he ki apane hosh sanbhaalane se lekar ab tak wo lagaataar ek ke baad ek gunahon ko anjaam detaa rahaa he
 And it is probably his genius that in his list of crimes, girls and women are the most guilty of putting their hands on their dignity
 apni cab main ek ladki ko pick karne ke baad kiye gaye rape karne kii is vaardaat ko mila liya jaae, to ab tak mote taur par uske khilaaf balaatkaar ke paanch or chhedchhad ke ek maamle kaa pataa chalaa he
 While the people of his village themselves tell that he has put his hand on the cloak of so many girls and women in his own village that there is no account of that
 jaahir he, gaanv ke log, police or khud shiv kumaar yadav ke gharavaalon kii maane wo ek serial repist he

 Troubled Pakistani Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani will appear before the apex court on Monday to face contempt charges
 is maamle main unke bhagya kaa faisla ho saktaa he or yadi unhone raashtrapati ke khilaaf bhrashtachar ke maamalon ko phir kholane se inkaar kiya to desh ek naye raajnneetik asthirataa ke daur se guzar saktaa he
 Gilani, 59, said before his appearance in the Supreme Court that he would resign from the post if the court convicted him against Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari for refusing to reopen corruption cases in Switzerland
 unhone aljajira se saakshaatkaar main kaha, ‘nishchit rup se pad chhodane kii koi aavashyaktaa nahin he, us haal main main sansad sadsy bhi nahin bana rah saktaa
 Gilani said, 'I have a good relationship with my powerful army at the present time
 ’ kuch samay pehle gilaani or sena ke bich memo cond ko lekar sambandhon main kai saptaah tak tanaav rahaa tha
 He said he was 'disappointed' by the unilateral action taken by the US to kill Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad
 unhone kaha, ‘unhen is bare main jaankaree saajha kerani chahie thi
 This was the reason why this unilateral action was not right
 ’ gilaani ne kaha ki ucchtam nyaayalay dwaara doshi qaraar dene par vah sansad kii sadsyta se swat: hi ayogy ho jaaenge
 If Gilani is convicted, he can be sentenced to six years and with removal from his post, he can be barred from holding any public office for five years
 gilaani ko ek tagada jhatka dete hue pakistan ke sheersh nyaayalay ke pradhan nyaayadhish iftikhar choudhary ne shuukravaar ko avmaananaa ke aarope tay karne ke khilaaf daayar kii gai unki apil ko khaarij kar diya tha
 Earlier on January 19, when the contempt case came up, Gilani personally appeared in the court and said that the government could not resume cases against the president as he was fully exempt in Pakistan and abroad
 gilaani kii daleelon ko khaarij karte hue nyaayalay ne unase kaha ki koi bhi vyakti kanoon se upar nahin he or aapke paas jaradaari ke khilaaf bhrashtachar ke maamle phir se shuru karne ke liye switzraland ke adhikariyon ko patr likhane ke alaava or koi vikalp nahin he
 Asked whether he believed he would go to jail, Geelani said he did not believe it would happen 'as you thought
 ’unhone doharaaya ki unhone switzraland ke adhikariyon ko patr likhakar nahin kaha he ki ve jaradaari ke khilaaf dhan shodhan ke maamle ko phir se kholen kyonki unhen na keval pakistan main hi nahin balki ‘puure vishwa main chhot praapt he
 Gilani said that Zardari was elected by both the Houses of Parliament and the four provincial assemblies in 2008 and there was no objection at that time
 sattarudh pakistan pipuls party ke sutron ne bataaya ki ummid he ki jab gilaani adaalat main upasthit honge to vah apane ruukh par kaayam rahenge
 Legal experts said that after being convicted, the president has the right to grant him clemency
 janemaane vakil evam saansad es em jafar ne kaha ki raashtrapati kii ore se kshamaadaan tabhi lagu hoga jab sajaa adaalat kii ore se sunaayi jaati he lekin us sthiti main unki doshasiddhi record main rahegi
 Therefore, the Prime Minister may be disqualified despite pardon from the President

 After all, how 3 players of Rajasthan Royals got caught in the bookmakers' trap
 jaane is kaale khel kaa puraa sach
 Is 'D' company playing fixing game? Are the fixing wires connected to the underworld? The black world is not connected to the black world in cricket
 is puure khel main mohare kai hai lekin mastermind ek jo saat samandar paar baitha he
 Jeeju Janardan became the real face of bookies, started with Sreesanth's club cricket partner Jiju
 jiju ne kerala chhodkar jab dubai main sampark banaaye to wo betting sindicket ke haathon main aa gaya
 Jiju was not aware of the faces behind the betting
 use ye ilm na tha kii stadium ke bheetar or baahar satte ke asli khilaadi mumbai ke wo bhai hai jo anderworld kii kaali duniya chalaate he
 On the other hand, when the brothers of Jurm came to know that there is a great firefly of cricket in Jiju's pocket, the betting kings' saliva started dripping

 He thought that once Sreesanth went up, many of the Rajasthan Royals players would be in the syndicate's story

 Jiju told both the young players that spot fixing is so easy that no other player of the team will understand it and lakhs will be lost
 over main ek no ball daalane ke liye 50 se 60 lakh mil sakate hai
 Apparently, these small town players could not turn down this offer of male freebies and got caught in the clutches of the betting cartel
 dubai main baithe anderworld ke gurgon ne jab ipel kii ek kaamyaab team kii is tikdi ko mohara banate dekha to phir bade paimaane par spot phixing kaa khel shuru hua

 In the 90s, Chhota Rajan and Sharad Shetty used to sit in Dubai and run a cricket cartel for Dawood Ibrahim
 1993 bam dhamaakon ke baad jab chota rajan or daaud alag hue to cricket main sattebaaji ke bhi do sindicket ho gaye
 The biggest syndicate was run by Sharad Shetty, who financed Dawood
 betting ke kaarobaar par kabja jamaane ke liye chota rajan ne dubai ke india club main sharad shetty kii goli markar hatya karvaa di
 But by 2005, Sharad Shetty was handled by Sunil Mirchandani alias Sunil Dubai, a businessman in Mumbai

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been advocating for holding the Lok Sabha and Assembly elections together
 bihar main bijepi kii dobaaraa se sahyogi bani jediu ne phir se modi ke is mudde par haa main haa milaayaa he
 JDU Bihar state president Vashistha Narayan Singh has said that if the Bihar assembly elections along with the Lok Sabha elections, then the party is ready for it
 darasalbihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumarakaphi pehle se is baat par jor dete rahe hai ki loksabhaa or vidhansabha kaa chunaav ek saath hona chahie taaki desh main paise or sansadhano kii bachat ho sake
 Nitish Kumar advocated holding Lok Sabha and Assembly elections all over the country together, JDU was with BJP and now when the issue has been raised once again, he is still with BJP
 bihar main vidhansabha kaa chunaav 2020 main hone vaala he, vahiin loksabhaa chunaav 2019 main hai
 In such a situation, the Bihar Legislative Assembly has to be dissolved about one and a half years ago
 iske baad hi loksabhaa ke chunaav ke saath vidhansabha chunaav ho sakegaa
 In such a situation, the term of the current assembly will be only three and a half years
 jabaki vipaksh iske liye taiyaar nahin he
 RJD leader and former Bihar deputy CM Tejashwi Yadav has clearly said that JDU is forced to take such a decision under BJP pressure
 loksabhaa chunaav ke saath keval bihar ke vidhansabha kaa chunaav karaane se kaam nahin chalegaa
 The rest of the country will also have to come together
 isamen kai aise rajya hai, jahaan kaa kaarykaal do saal bhi nahin ho paaegaa yaa usase bhi kam hoga
 In such a situation it is not possible without creating a criterion
 bihar vidhansabha kaa chunaav loksabhaa ke saath karaane main jediu or bijepi ko phayda ho saktaa he
 The biggest advantage is the coordination of seats
 doosraa ye ki nitish kumaar par argedy lagaataar aarope laga rahi he ki janadesh kaa apmaan kar wo bijepi ke saath khadey hai
 The RJD has 80 mlas, it is currently in the strongest position and in opposition since being out of power in 2005
 aise main jitna jaldi chunaav ho jaae acha hoga
 The biggest advantage may be the synergy of BJP and JDU seats
 isamen sidhaa formula loksabhaa kii zyada siten bijepi lade or vidhansabha main jediu ko ladane de
 Although JDU was in Bihar in the role of elder brother in both elections before 2013, the strengthening of BJP in 2014 seems to change the equation

 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar is so caught up with Sharad Yadav, the former president of Janata Dal United, that neither Sharad can be expelled from the party nor can keep him together for long
 darasal nitish ke mahagathbandhan se naata todane se sharad yadav naaraaz hai or khulkar bagawati tevar apanaae hue hai
 In such a situation, Nitish Kumar wants action on the party's Rajya Sabha MP Sharad Yadav, but the rules have thrown such a screw that even though he is unable to do so
 pichley dinon rajyasabha main jediu sansadeey dal ke netaa aaaraseepi singh or mahasachiv sanjay jha ne uparashtrapati venkaiya naidu se mulaakaat kar sharad yadav ke khilaaf karrwai kii maang kii
 JDU wants Venkaiah to cease membership of Sharad as the Chairman of Rajya Sabha as Sharad is working against the party
 sawaal uthta he ki agarnitish vastav main sharadpar karrwai chaahate hai to khud unhen party se baahar kyon nahin kar dete
 After all, why are they with the support of the Chairman of Rajya Sabha for action? Struggle with Rajya Sabha membership
 If Nitish Kumar himself is expelled from the party by taking action, then in such a situation his Rajya Sabha membership will not end
 duusari ore yadi sharad yadav khud party chhodkar jate hai to unki rajyasabha sadsyta chali jaaegi
 This is the reason why JDU wants Sharad to either resign from the party or to end his membership while the Rajya Sabha chairman takes action on him
 darasal samvidhan kii 10veen anusuchee main sadan ke baahar ke aacharan par bhi sadsyta jane kaa praavdhaan he or isse purv bijepi ne apane rajyasabha sadsy jai narayan nishad or janata dal united ne upendra kushvaha kii sadsyta radd karwaai thi
 In view of this, JDU leaders RCP Singh and Sanjay Jha have submitted memorandum to Vice President Venkaiah Naidu to end the Rajya Sabha membership of Sharad Yadav and Ali Anwar
 sharad ko shahid nahin bananaa chaahtisharad ke khilaaf nitish agar sidhe ection lete hai or unhen party se baahar kaa rasta dikhaate hai to sharad yadav apane aapako shahid ke taur par pesh kar sakate hai, aise main unke paksh main sahanubhuti ho sakati he
 This is also the reason that Nitish Kumar is avoiding direct action against him
 party main na ho sake baghawatsharad ke khilaaf sidhi karrwai se party main baghawat ho sakati he
 That is why Nitish is blowing very loudly
 darasal sharad yadav bhi jediu ke lambey samay tak rashtriya adhyaksh rahe hai
 In such a situation, there are many people in his organization
 nitish kisi tarah kii sidhi karrwai karenge to sanghathan main bhi foot kii ashanka he
 At the moment Nitish does not want to create any such controversy
 ladaai ve bhale hi haar chuke hai, lekin karnataka ke purv mukhyamantri bi

 yeddiurppa kaa har lihaaj se ashaaleen grih yuddh gati pakad rahaa he
 In such a situation, can his successor survive the coming headache? The 58-year-old Sadanand Gowda, the soft-spoken and ever-smiling Chief Minister, will have to keep a stock of analgesics at least with him
 yeddiurppa apane iraade kaa spasht sanket pehle hi de chuke hai
 Demonstrating his power to turn his resignation into a political drama, he went on a march to Raj Bhavan along with 70 BJP mlas, 20 members of the Legislative Council and 14 mps from Karnataka, which shocked the party high command
 vokkaliga samudaay ke gauda ne gupt matdaan ke dauraan bhaajapa ke rashtriya mahasachiv anant kumaar ke ummidavaar jagadish shetter ko haraa diya
 Anant Kumar has few friends in Karnataka's political circles because of his growing influence in national politics
 yahaan tak ki yeddiurppa ke virdohi bhi anant kumaar kii jagah purv mukhyamantri ko hi tarjeeh dete hai
 Gowda headed the bjp's Karnataka unit from 2007 to 2010, but has no administrative experience as he has never been a minister
 2008 main karnataka main bhaajapa ko vindhyachal ke paar dakshin main aitihaasik vijay dilaane or uske baad 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main bhi party ko rajya se baari bahumat se jitaane vaale yeddiurppa ne ghoshnaa kii he ki ve jansamarthan jutaney ke liye rajyavyapee daura karenge
 He insisted that he had no "personal agenda" and did not want to become a "super chief with remote control in hand"
 lekin iske baavjood ve yah daawa karne se nahin chuke ki ve agle chah maheene main bataur mukhyamantri laut aaenge, haalanki gauda ke bare main ummid kii ja rahi he ki ve 22 maheene shashan karenge
 Although Gowda is Yeddyurappa's confidant and loyal to his camp, tensions are beginning to creep into his smile
 yeddiurppa ke dabaav banane or up mukhyamantri ke rup main shetter ke unke sir par bane rahane kii vajah se gauda ke liye karnataka ke mukhyamantri kii kursi sanbhaalanaa aasaan nahin hoga
 Yeddyurappa the way Rajnath Singh, Arun Jaitley and M
 vankeya naidu sareekhe varisht netaaon ko kareeb ek saptaah tak apni ungaliyon par nachaate rahe, usase sabit hota he ki ve chaahe mukhyamantri hon yaa nahin, karnataka kii raajnneeti main unhen aasaani se shikast nahin di ja sakati
 The BJP high command has also understood well that the threat from their side has not reduced yet
 bhaajapa kii paanton main yadi yeddiurppa kaa sammaan he to log unase darate bhi hai
 He is the only leader who has public support
 lingayat hone kii vajah se unki takat or bad jaati he
 That is why every Lingayat Math supports them
 ve unhen baari rakam daan main jo dete rahete hai
 Yeddyurappa openly violated the directives of the party leadership, something no chief minister would have done in recent times
 unhone party ke varisht netaaon yaa party ke nirdeshon kii koi parvaah nahin kii, haalanki saarvajanik taur par ve yah dikhaava karte rahe ki ve ''party netritv kii ajna kaa paalan karenge
 "his ardent opponent Anant Kumar supported the Shettar and led the Lingayat community
" yeddiurppa kii tarah shetter bhi lingayat hai, lekin gupt matdaan ke faisle ne spasht kar diya ki lingayat samudaay kii vafadari kis taraf he
 After the vote, the BJP had decided that the number of votes cast in favor of which contender for the post of Chief Minister would not be disclosed
 lekin yah khabar ki gauda ke paksh main 63 vot pade jabaki shetter maatr 59 vot hi praapt kar sake, gauda kaa agle mukhyamantri ke rup main swaagat kiye jane ke chand minuton ke bheetar hi media ko li kar di gai
 This may have been done by Yeddyurappa supporters only to demonstrate their influence
 karnataka kii nai sarkaar ke saamne kai chunautiyon main se ek un logon ke khilaaf karrwai shuru karne kii he, jinke naam purv lokayukta en
 Santosh Hegde's extensive reports are listed
 rajnatik halkon main atakalein hai ki yeddiurppa kaa istipha antat is shart par hasil kiya gaya ki avaidh khanan maamle main unke khilaaf koi karrwai nahin kii jaaegi
 In this regard, Gowda's work will not be easy
 apane guru kii tarah hi un par bhi ek jameen ghotaale kaa bojha dhone kaa aarope he
 It is said that he is accused of being caught in a land scam even before being elected to the post of Chief Minister
 bhrashtachar se chalni rajya kaa kaarybhaar sanbhaalane ke saath hi gauda apni nijee eemaandaaree ke bare main sawaalon ke jawaab dene ke saath apriy jimmedaari ko sanbhaalenge
 It is clear that Yeddyurappa wants to use his own people to protect himself from legal action after any future action, especially after the scandal unfolded
 unki agali maang shaayad karnataka bhaajapa ke adhyaksh pad main badlaav kii hogi
 The outgoing Chief Minister has made his intention clear that he would prefer to become the President of the party, or else he would select a person for the post
 karnataka main bhaajapa ko khadaa karne vaale yeddiurppa ko agar apane upar kisi tarah kaa khatra dikhaai diya to ve un sabhi uplabdhiyon ko qurbaan karne ke liye taiyaar hai jinhen ve barason tak party ke liye hasil karte aae hai
 For so many years he has been centralizing power and it is believed that no file would go ahead without his consent
 rajya main mukhyamantri ke rup main 38 maah or up-mukhyamantri ke rup main 20 maah kaa yeddiurppa kaa shashan jitna vivaadaaspad rahaa, utana shaayad hi koi rahaa hoga
 Since becoming the Chief Minister, complaints started coming against him and minor rebellions were taking place in the party
 phir bhi unka maananaa he ki yadi party ne chunaav karwaae to ve party todakar chunaav jeet sakate hai
 The central leadership has already tasted Yeddyurappa's infamy
 karnataka bhaajapa main unke mahatvapurn mukaam par bane rahane ke liye itnaa hi paryaapt he

 Following in the footsteps of Yeddyurappa, the new Karnataka Chief Minister Dewargunda Venkatappa Sadanand Gowda has been caught in a land scam before taking over
 soochna kaa adhikaar kanoon ke antargat bangaloru ke ek dainik dwaara praapt soochna main kaha gaya he ki udupi ke saansad ne bangaloru main do rihaayshi sampattiyon ko jodakar bangaloru vikaas praadhikaran ke kanoonon kaa ulanghan kiya
 Both the places were allotted under the discretionary quota of the Chief Minister
 bangaloru vikaas praadhikaran ke niyamon main spasht taur par kaha gaya he ki do jagahon ko milakar ek tabhi kiya ja saktaa he jab donon sampattiyaan ek hi vyakti kii hon
 "the property that belongs to your children or siblings or even to a married couple cannot be clubbed together," says an authority official
 ''kharidaar or praadhikaran ke bich samajhaite ke chauthe praavdhaan main is baat par roak lagaai gai he ki makaan maalik sampatti kaa istemaal ghoshit uddeshy ke bajaae kisi anya uddeshy ke liye nahin kar saktaa
 In the case of Gowda's property, the land was acquired as residential property and it is now understood that a five-storey commercial complex is being constructed on the land spread over two residential sites

 asweekaar kiye jane ke baavjood, ve aage bade or ek vyavsaayik parisar banane ke liye unhone bhukhndon ko jod diya
 In this way, Gowda has violated the rules in three ways — by constructing a commercial complex on a residential plot, illegally owning two properties and constructing a five-story building — even after rejecting a request from the authority
 The rule allows only three floors to be built

 input: bhashaa Virat Kohli is being exploited on the feat that some record is coming out even after the next several days
 ravivaar ko srilankai purv captain angelo maithyuj ne unhen gam diya tha, lekin somvaar aate-aate viraat kohli ne is gam kaa apane hi andaaj main hisaab chuktaa kar diya
 Kohli gave Mathews such a shock that the Sri Lankan all-rounder would not even be able to recover, or not! darasal hua yah ki kotla test ke duusare din shaam ko slip main viraat kohli se angelo maithyuj kaa bahut hi aasaan kaich chhitak gaya tha
 Then Virat did not feel much grief, but as time went by, this catch was given a lot of grief to Kohli
 gam kii vajah yah rahi ki maithyuj ne is chode gaye kaich kareeb sau ran ke aas-paas bhunaate hue shatak thok daalaa
 But on the third day, a feat by Kohli came out which left Mathews behind
 yah bhi padhein : isiilie viraat kohli darate hai pujaara ke saath 'kuch bhi' khilne se! Actually the Sri Lankan all-rounder made a very special record three years ago
 tab maithyuj ne saal bhar main sabhi formet ( test, vanade-tii-20) main khele 53 maichon main 65
 He scored 2,687 runs at an average of 53
 lekin ab viraat ne unhen peeche chhod diya he
 Virat Kohli has become the third-highest batsman in all formats in a year due to the fire that Kohli boiled in the ongoing year
 viraat saal 2017 main abhi tak 2,768 ran banaakar is maamle main teesri paaydaan par aa gaye hai
 The comments yah bhi padhein : maithyuj ke shatak main rohit kaa 'haath'
 
 dakshin africa main kaise kaam chalegaa? Now, within a year, in all formats, Virat has scored more runs than second-ranked Ricky Ponting (2833, 2005) and Kumar Sangakkara (2868, 2014)
 vahiin chauthe number par newjiland ke can williamson (2692, saal 2015) or unke baad paanchaven number par agenlo maithyuj hai
 By the way, let me tell you that in the year 2017, Virat also won 6 Man of the Match and twice Man of the Series titles in his bag
 Back to back double Actually, it happened that on the second day of Kotla Test, very easy catch of Virat Kohli was dropped in the evening slip
 tab to viraat ko iskaa zyada gam nahin hua lekin jyon-jyon vakt gujarata gaya, vaise-vaise kohli ko yah kaich bahut gam de gaya
 The reason for the gum was that Mathews hit a century by roasting around the abandoned catches for almost a hundred runs
 magar tisare din kohli kaa ek aisa karnama nikalakar aayaa, jisane maithyuj ko peeche chhod diya
 Also read: That's why Virat Kohli is afraid of playing 'anything' with Pujara! darasal srilankai olerounder ne teen saal pehle bahut hi special record bana daalaa tha
 Matthews then played 65 matches in 53 matches played in all formats (test, ODI-T20) throughout the year
 53 ke ausat se 2,687 ran bana daale the
 But now Virat has left him behind
 jari saal main balle jo aag kohli ne ugali, usase viraat ek saal ke bheetar sabhi formanton main sabase zyada ran banane vaale tisare number ke ballebaaj ban gaye hai
 Virat has reached the third position in this case by scoring 2,768 runs in the year 2017 so far

 ' mumbai kii local trainon main 14 siten varisht nagarikon ke liye arakshit hongi
 This decision has been ordered by the Bombay High Court to keep seat reserves in every local train, which the Railways will have to implement from April 15
 court ne railway prashasan se saaf kah diya he ki wo ye sunishchit karen ki rigerv siton kaa istemaal keval senior citizan hi karen, koi or nahin
 In Mumbai, about 75 lakh people travel every day in the local of Western, Central and Haberra lines, these trains have separate coaches for women, a portion of coaches is reserved for the disabled also
 lekin varisht nagarikon ke liye aisi koi sahuuliyat nahin he
 a petition was filed by freedom fighter and senior citizen AB Thakkar urging the court to take a decision in the matter
 unki yachika par faisla dete hue justise abhaya ok or eke menon kii khandpeeth ne kaha second class ke dibbe main bujurgon ke liye kuch siten rigerv hoti hai lekin ye dekha gaya he ki vounaka upyog nahin kar pate
 The seats should clearly state that they are for senior citizens
 isse pehle railway ne court ke saamne daleel di thi ki unke liye varisht nagarikon ke liye seat rigerv karnaa, yaa dibba arakshit karnaa vyavaaharik nahin hoga, kyonki isse aam musafiron ke liye jagah kam ho jaaegi jisase durghatana kaa khatara bad saktaa he
 Mumbai's local trains have a carrying capacity of 1800 passengers, with more than 8000 people traveling at peak hours
 parivertini ekadshi (parivartini Ekadashi) yaa parshv ekadshi (parsva Ekadashi) kaa vishesh mahatv he
 It is believed that Lord Vishnu sleeps in Chaumas i
e
 Ashadh, Shravan, Bhado and Ashwin and then rises on the day of Devuthani Ekadashi
 lekin in maheenon main ek samay aisa bhi aata he jab sote hue shri hari vishnu apni karavat badalte hai
 This is the time of Ekadashi of the Shukla Paksha of Bhadra month
 is ekadshi ko parivertini ekadshi kehete hai or is din bhagwaan vishnu ke vaaman avatar kii puja kaa vidhaan he
 It is believed that by observing this Ekadashi fast, all sins of the devotees are destroyed and after death they get heaven
 kehete hai ki parivertini ekadshi kii katha padhane yaa sunne se hajaar ashwamedh yajna ke baraabar fal miltaa he
 In his left hand, Lord Vishnu took the test of King Bali
 raja bali ne teenon lokon par apana adhikaar kar liya tha lekin usamen ek gun yah tha ki vah kisi bhi brahman ko khaali haath nahin bhejtaa tha
 He used to donate to it
 daitya guru shukracharya ne use bhagwaan vishnu kii chaal se avgat bhi karavaaya lekin baavjood uske bali ne vaaman swaroop bhagwaan vishnu ko teen pag jameen dene kaa vachan de diya
 What was it then that in two steps, Lord Vishnu measured all the worlds, there was nothing left for the third step, so Bali fulfilled his promise and put his head under his foot
 bhagwaan vishnu kii krupa se bali rasaatal main pataal lok main rahane laga
 Hearing this, she got nervous and asked her seven sisters-in-law to get her womb tied in return
 sabase choti bahu ko nanad kaa dard dekha naa gaya or wo apni kokh bandhavane ke liye taiyaar ho gai
 After this incident, his children would have died on the seventh day
 aise karte-karte choti bahu ke saat beton kii mrityu hui
 Seeing this frequent occurrence with him, he called Pandit and asked the reason for this
 pandit ne hal bataate hue salaah di ki vah surabhi gaay kii seva kare
 The comments choti bahu ne surabhi kii seva or uski seva se prasann hokar surabh gaay use syahu ke paas le jaati he, jisane use shraap diya tha
 On the way to Sihu's house, the younger daughter-in-law stops for rest
 achaanak vah dekhati he ki ek saanp garud pankhni ke bachche ko dansane ja rahaa he
 She kills the snake
 lekin garud pankhni ko khun dekh galati se lagata he ki choti bahu ne uske bachche kii hatya kar di
 Before she speaks in anger, she is told that she saved the child's life by killing the snake
 garud pankhni is baat par prasann hokar choti bahu ko syahu ke paas pahunchaa detii he
 There, Syahu, pleased with the service of the younger daughter-in-law, blesses her with seven sons and seven daughters-in-law
 iske baad choti bahu se ghar phir kabhi putr kii asamay mrityu nahin hoti or hameshaa ke liye uskaa ghar haraa-bharaa ho jaataa he
 Pleased with the service and service of Surbhi, the younger daughter-in-law, Surbhu takes her to Syahu, who cursed her
 syahu ke ghar jate hue raste main choti bahu aaraam ke liye rukati he
 Suddenly she sees that a snake is going to sting the child of Garuda Phanshi
 vah saanp ko maar detii he
 But after seeing the blood of Garuda Phanni, it seems that the younger daughter-in-law murdered her child
 vah krodh main aakar kuch bolti isse pehle use bataaya jaataa he ki usne saanp ko markar bachche kii jaan bachaai
 Garuda Phanni is pleased at this and sends the younger daughter-in-law to Sihu
 vahaan, syahu choti bahu kii seva se prasann hokar use saat putr or saat bahu kaa aashirwad detii he
 After this, the son never dies again from his younger daughter-in-law's house and his house becomes green forever
 vahaan, syahu choti bahu kii seva se prasann hokar use saat putr or saat bahu kaa aashirwad detii he

 Want to face inflation or recession? Choose your problem
 philhal to donon hi badhane vaali hai
 According to the Reserve Bank, inflation will increase in the next three months
 or is saal kii duusari timahi main vikaas dar 4
 5 percent is not the end of this slope
 agle chah maah main mandi gahraaegi
 This year the growth rate of five percent is also impossible
 bachat, khapat or nivesh main kami se bani yah mandi jitani uljhan bhari he, mahangaai usase kam pechida nahin he
 It is understandable only after the peeling of inflation that the Reserve Bank has stopped the reduction in interest rates, and has moved the government to fight the recession and on the other hand the government is unable to understand which inflation is good
 And what is the worst or how to break this pair of recession and inflation? • Wholesale inflation in the month of October at the lowest level of 40 months (0
 16 fisad) thi, jabaki khudara mahangaai 16 maheene ke sarvocch str 4
 At 6 percent
 thok mahangaai utpaadakon ke str par keemton kii napjokh he jabaki khudara mahangaai upabhoktaaon kii jeb par asar kii paimaaish karti he
 The record decrease in wholesale inflation is evidence of demand breakdown due to which producers (farmers and industry) are not able to raise prices
 is saal rabi mausam tak krishi or khaadya utpaadon kii keemten laagat se kam thim
 The prices of manufacturing products have not increased for the past several months
 duusari taraf, khudara yani upabhokta mahangaai is saal janvari se badhane lagi thi jo ab sarkaar ko daraane vaale str tak aa gai
 Wholesale inflation is evidence of slowdown in consumption and retail inflation is expensive consumption
 donon kaa ek saath prakat hona maang or aapurti donon main dhanchaagat dikkaton kaa durlabh duryog he• mahangaai kaa doosraa pech yah he ki aapurti kii dikkaton ke kaaran falon-subjiyon vaali khaadya mahangaai bad rahi he jabaki maang main kami ke kaaran gharelu khapat ke saamaan, sevaaon, bhawan nirmaan, sanchaar keemton main badhotaree nahin hui he yani utpaadakon ke laabh nahin bad rahe hai
 • Another major challenge is the difference between urban and rural inflation
 aktubar ke maheene main gaanvon main khaadya mahangaai badhane kii dar 6
 4 percent while 10 in cities
 5 fisad
 • Another face of inflation measurement increases the confusion manifold
 care retings ke ek taaja adhyayan ke anusaar, pichley vitt varsh main bharat ke 19 rajyon main upabhokta mahangaai, rashtriya ausat se zyada rahi jabaki 11 rajyon main rigerv bank ke adarsh paimaane (4 fisad) se upar thi, yani ki hamaare pados kii mahangaai, desh kii mahangaai se bilkul alag he
 In light of the recession, the contradiction of inflation has put the economy in a state of difficult choices
 puraa utpaadan kshetra mandi kaa shikaar he
 This includes both farmers and industry
 2014 se 2019 ke bich kheti main kamai badhane kii raftaar isse pehle ke dashak kii tulana main aadhi rahi thi
 It is important to increase prices from both the farmer and industry point of view because now the wheel of consumption cannot revolve without increasing income and employment
 achraj nahin ki mandi ke baavjood mobile bill or kuch kaaron kii keemat main ijapha shuru ho gaya he
 For urban consumers, this scenario seems troublesome
 khaastaur par rojgaar dene vaale udyogon main mandi ke kaaran nai naukariyaan band hai or vetan main badhat bhi
 In such condition, food inflation will increase the troubles of life
 mahangaai yaa keemton main badhotaree bharat main samvedansheel paimaana he
 On this, the future of producers also rests and also the consumption
 bharat ke krishi bazaar main adhikansh keemten sarkaar tay karti he
 The poor distribution system does not allow market benefits to reach the farmers
 duusari taraf, baari tex, puunji kii kami or urja kii oonchi laagat ke kaaran udyogon kaa margin simit he isliye kaarobaari laabh maang or mulya, donon main badhotaree se aate hai
 Unnecessary intervention of governments has spoiled the market
 haal ke varshon main bharat main nunatam mahangaai ke baad bhi maang nahin badi
 Now the imbalance of policies is stifling
 na fasalon kii maang-aapurti par koi doorgaami niti he or na udyogon par tex kii
 The government sometimes runs towards a quick import of onions, which causes the balance of the crop market to deteriorate, and sometimes makes unexpected changes in tax rules on companies
 jaise ki pehle korporate tex ghataakar ghaataa badhaayaa gaya, ab jiesti badhaane kii taiyaari ho rahi he
 Stagflation is the most complex of the various recessionary volumes
 bekaari or mahangi jindagi kii yah jahrili jodi bhartiya arthvyavastha ko gher rahi he
 The government will soon have to decide whether to let inflation rise or slow down
 chunaav kathin he lekin is aag ke dariyaa main dub kar janaa hi hoga or koi sahaj vikalp nahin he

 Efforts were on to convince him, but on Sunday, Shivpal in Mainpuri spoke loudly and said that his party's overbearing people are involved in land grabbing and illegal liquor business
 afasar bhrasht hai or unki baat koi nahin sun rahaa he
 If this continues, then he will resign from the party
 ghatega akhilesh kaa kadaisaki pushti aaj mulaayam singh yadav ne party main karte hue kaha ki shivpal ne teen baar unako apana istipha saunpa he, magar har baar unhone unhen roak liya he
 Mulayam Singh said that if Shivpal Yadav left the party, then the government would be satisfied
 mulaayam ke in tewaron se saaf jaahir he ki party ke nitigat faisle ab mulaayam, shivpal or ram gopal hi lenge
 Akhilesh's role will now be seen less
 bahut saare video aae hai jinamein police kii barbarta darj hui he
 She is unilaterally penetrating into people's homes and killing them
 koi akelaa police se ghira hua he or us par chaaron taraf se laathiyaan barasaai ja rahi he
 In one video, people have fallen on each other and the police are being brutally lathi-charged
 jab koi pakade jane kii sthiti main hai to use maarane kaa kya matlab? jab koi ghar main he or vahaan hinsa nahin kar rahaa he to phir ghar main maarane kaa kya matlab? zaahir he police kii dilchaspee aam garib logon ko maarane main zyaada he
 He has a license to beat anyone as a nuisance
 kai saare video main police badla leti dikh rahi he
 She is damaging nearby properties
 vahaan khadi motorcycle ko tod rahi he
 Shops are breaking
 pathar chalaa rahi he
 She is running there where stones have gone on it but she is also seen running where there is no one in front and the police is killing the stones
 iskaa koi aankalan nahin he ki police kii hinsa or todphod se kitne kaa nuqasaan hua he? sirf jamiya se khabar ai he ki dhai karod kii sampatti kaa nuqasaan hua he
 There was peace within the university, was there no violence in the library? Will Yogi Adityanath or Amit Shah compensate people by auctioning police assets in such cases? Seven people have died in UP
 police aaraam se kah detii he ki usne goli nahin chalaai to phir vahaan par maujuud vah kya kar rahi thi? uske paas bhi to camere hote hai vahi bataa den ki goli kahaan se or kaise chal rahi thi? jamiya millia kii hinsa main teen goliyaan chali hai
 At first the police did not say that when NDTV showed this news, then many kinds of theory were given
 jab police ghirne lagi to kaha gaya ki logon ne chalaae or unke paas desi katte the
 Think that if this happens, the police do not tell on the first day? What stronger evidence could he have in support of his violence? Then when the video came in which the police were seen firing the police and the media was killed in silence
 zaahir he media police kii hinsa ko lekar zyaada sahansheel he
 Had he been interested in democracy, these questions would have been prominent
 har baar yah kahana ki bahari logon ne hinsa kii police ke jawaab par shaq paidaa karata he
 Shouldn't this police violence be shown? Many such videos are going viral but for fear of showing the media is going viral
 har jagah se police kii hinsa se jude prashnon or video ko saafe kar diya gaya he
 Only the violence of the people on the channels are visuals or in the news strip it is rightly written that the mob committed violence
 main yah nahin kah rahaa ki log hinsa nahin karte hai
 They do not create a state of violence
 bilkul karte hai
 In this case, people are not even washed with milk but in every case of violence or in most of the cases the violence of police is less visible
 jo bhi he kuch pradarshnon main kuch logon ko belgaum hote dekha ja saktaa he
 Stones are being run from among them
 aise log apni uttejnaa se maahaul ko tanaavpurn bana rahe hai
 They run stones in their street and weaken the protests of other cities
 logon kii uttejnaa se police ko kuch bhayankar hone kii ashanka main satark or atisakriy hone kaa mauqaa miltaa he
 a video has come from Ahmedabad
 logon ne police ko hi daboch liya he
 Violence on the police
 magar usee bheed se saat noujvaan nikal kar aate hai or police ko bachaate bhi hai
 This video was discussed a lot
 viral jagat or media donon main lekin jis video main kai saare police vaale ek aadmi par tabadatod laathiyaan barasaa rahe hai us par charchaa nahin
 Two videos are circulating from Daryaganj
 usamen police ke log chat par inten todate dekhe ja sakate hai
 There is a video of a night in which someone is surrounded and killed in the street
 wo cheekh rahaa he phir bhi maare ja rahe hai
 Whereas if he was accused of violence, then the police could easily be caught without killing him
 mangalore se aise kuch video viral ho rahe hai jisamen police kii barbarta saafe dikh rahi he
 When there is an attack from the front, the action of the police is understandable, but when there is no counter-attack, then the reason for entering the streets and shops and wreaking havoc is to keep only the people in position
 dariyaganj kaa ek or video viral ho rahaa he jisamen police vaale danda se car ke shishe tod rahe hai
 There are no people there
 logon kii car khadi he or police todate ja rahi he
 Would she have done this in someone else's neighborhood? It is the Delhi Police who quietly walked through the Tis Hazari Court
 vakeelon ne to kathith rup se lowep main aag laga di thi
 When the policemen were killed, did you see that Delhi Police was searching from their homes and rooms? Breaking their cars? So are we seeing the communal face of the Delhi Police? Whatever it is, the police is allowed violence
 aatmaraksha ke naam par uski hinsa ko sahi maan liya jaataa he
 After watching the video, it seems that the police have come in the process of killing
 kai video main police gaaliyaan detii dikh rahi he
 Telling people communal things
 jamiya main ladakiyon ko jinna kaa pilla kaha gaya
 a BJP leader says that the insects are coming out of the dandy when they are injected
 yah samaj lenaa chahie ki jin logon kaa satta par niyantran he unki bhashaa aisi he
 So the police will be allowed to speak such a language
 to kya pradarshnon ko hinsa ke hawaale karnaa thik hoga? meri raay main isse sanak bharaa faisalaa nahin ho saktaa
 Nothing will be achieved by violence
 isse peeche hatana hi hoga
 People will also have to learn how to behave, how to speak language when going to a performance
 varanaa police taiyaar baithi he
 Good thing that in many places the police did a fantastic job
 logon ko pradarshan karne diya or logon ne bhi dhang se pradarshan kiya
 This is why most demonstrations have been peaceful
 iske liye log or police donon badhai ke paatr hai
 The citizenship register and the law protest are devoid of leader, so it is the responsibility of the people to protect them from violence
 jaan-maal kaa nuqasaan thik nahin he
 No one gets justice when violence happens
 keval bahes hoti he
 People should understand that the law has been made
 NRC aegi
 So this is not a matter of a day
 jo log iske virodh main hai unke dhiraj or hausale kaa imtahaan he
 It is easy to come by running for a day
 sarkaar bhi intazaar main he ki do chaar dinon main thak jaaenge yaa phir itane log police kii goli se maar die jaaenge ki pradarshan kaa maqasad hi samaapt ho jayega
 Do not let violence happen
 na kiijie or na karne dijie

 raajnneetik hinsa badhate dekh chunaav ayog ne bengal main prachaar kaa samay kam kar diya he to vahiin mamata banerjee ke kareebi afasaron par bhi gaaj giri he
 Mamta Banerjee was enraged after the attack on the officers and heard the Election Commission very well
 darasal, mamata banerjee chunaav ayog par yun hi nahin bhadakin
 Actually, the officers who have been removed or shifted also include Mamta Banerjee's special officers
 chunaav ayog ne bengal ke pradhan sachiv (grih) atri bhattacharya ko pad se hataaya
 Along with this, CID ADG Rajiv Kumar was also removed from his post
 koun hai rajeev kumaar?ye vahi rajeev kumaar hai, jinako lekar beete dinon mamata banerjee centre sarkaar ke khilaaf dharne par baith gai thim
 Before becoming CID ADG, he was the Commissioner of Kolkata Police and his house was raided by CBI
 isi ke khilaaf mamata banerjee ne modi sarkaar ke khilaaf hallaa bol diya tha
 However, after reaching the Supreme Court and the court order, the matter was resolved a little and Rajiv Kumar was removed from the post of Commissioner
 jiske baad unki niyukti siaidi main kii gai thi
 Now once again, the Election Commission has removed Rajiv Kumar from the post of CID and sent him back to the Ministry of Home Affairs
 yani ab vah centre sarkaar ke adheen kaam karenge
 Apart from direct war on law and order, Home Principal Secretary Atri Bhattacharya, who has been sent on leave, also has a great status in the Bengal government
 wo isliye kyonki rajya kii kanoon vyavastha kaa puraa jimmaa inhen ke upar he or puure chunaav ke dauraan kanoon vyavastha par hi sawaal uthte rahe hai
 The BJP has been alleging throughout the election that violence is happening at the behest of Mamata Banerjee and law and order is deteriorating continuously
 aise main ab chunaav ayog kii taraf se bhattacharya par hi chot kar di gai he
 After the action of the Election Commission, Mamata Banerjee called it a wrong action and called it an action taken at the behest of PM Narendra Modi
 aapako bataa den ki loksabhaa chunaav ke aakhri charan ke matdaan ke liye ab sirf teen din bache hai
 But Bengal has become an electoral arena before voting
 bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ke road sho main bavaal hua or uske baad mamata banerjee ne unpar hi hinsa kaa aarope laga diya
 Seeing the matter growing, the Election Commission came into action and it has reduced the campaign time

 dilli police ko ab uske bans kii lathi kii jagah halki evam suvidhajanak tareeke se upyog kiye jane vaale plastic ke danda die jaaenge
 Plastic poles inflict less pain on the human body than sticks
 ek police adhikari ne bataaya, 'policorbonate se bani, paardarshee, thos tathaa lagbhag na tuutane vaale padaarth kii is nai chadi kaa halkaa hone ke kaaran upyog karnaa aasaan he tathaa isse chot bhi kam lagati he
 "on the condition of not disclosing the name, the officer said," Since the weight of such sticks is less, they will cause less harm to a person and there will be no possibility of serious injury
 'yaad rahe ki dilli ke ramlila maidan main june 2011 main yogaguru baba ramdev kii samarthak ek 51 varshiya mahila ke police kii lathi se ghayal hokar marane kii ghatana ke baad dilli police ko kaaphi aalochana jhelni padi thi
 In addition to the dead Rajbala during the protest against corruption, many supporters of Ramdev had to suffer the police action

 The court also accused the police of using sticks

 It is clear that Pranab got the benefit of "cross voting" in the state
 pranab ko vaise to keval 98 vidhayakon ke mat hasil hone the, jinamein se congress ke 71 or jad-es ke 27 vidhayak shaamil the lekin unhen 19 or vidhayakon kaa samarthan hasil ho gaya

 One MLA did not vote in the July 19 vote
 rajya main bhaajapa kii sthiti vaise hi asamanjas vaali he kyonki do saal main use teen maukon par mukhyamantri badalane pade
 The votes polled by Mukherjee in Karnataka are 15327 while Sangma's votes are worth 13493
 gujarat main bhi bhaajapa ke ek vidhayak ne mukherjee ke paksh main matdaan kiya
 Though Pranab was supposed to get the votes of only 98 mlas, of which 71 were from Congress and 27 from JD-S but he got the support of 19 more mlas
 tippaniyan The ruling BJP has 119 mlas in the Karnataka Legislative Assembly but Sangma managed only 103 votes
 19 july ko hue matdaan main ek vidhayak ne matdaan nahin kiya
 The state of the BJP in the state is similarly confused as it had to change the chief minister on three occasions in two years

 haalanki is tarah ke maamle main samari trial yani likhit bayaan ke aadhaar par sunwaayee kii jaati he, lekin rahul gandhi ne samans trial (bayaan darj) kaa anurodh karte hue pichley maheene ek yachika daayar kii thi
 Congress President's counsel Narayan Iyer had said that the matter is related to historical facts, so he will have to take recourse to many documents and get the statements of experts recorded
 rahul supremecourt bhi gaye thebta den ki isse pehle rahul gandhi ne is maamle ko khaarij karaane ke liye supreme court kaa darwaja khatkhataya tha
 The apex court had said that they should not discredit any institution in this way
 agar ve is maamle main afsos jaahir nahin karte hai to unhen court main trial kaa saamana karnaa padegaa
 Gandhi rejected it and asked to join the court proceedings
 bharat kii dahalij par global sankat kii ek or dastak ko samajhane ke do tareeke ho sakate hai: ek ki ham ret main sir ghusaa kar yah kaamana karen ki yah duniyavi musiibat he or ham kisi tarah batch hi jaaenge
 The second is to start looking for opportunities in this crisis
 modi sarkaar ne doosraa rasta chunaa he lekin jaraa thahrie, isse pehle ki aap sarkaar kii sakaaraatmakataa par riz jaaen, hamen is sarkaar ko mili avasaron ke istemaal kaa record or jokhim lene kii kuwwat parakh leni chahie, kyonki yah sankat apane purvajon kii tulana main alag he or gaharaa asar chhodie vaala he
 It was only the stock markets that were leading the way in India
 china main musiibat ke baad, ubhartee arthvyavasthaaon se niveshkon kii vaapasi ke saath bharat ko lekar feel good kaa yah shikhar bhi darak gaya he, jo sasti videshi puunji par khadaa tha
 Not much has changed fundamentally in the Indian economy in the last two years
 chunaav kii taiyaariyon ke saath ummiido kii sidhippon par chadhakar share bazaaron ne oonchai ke shikhar bana die
 India's economic indicators are moderately hot, there is a recession, interest rates are high, inflation of essential commodities is present, demand is absent, profits and incomes are not increasing even as the weather has increased
 lekin videshi mudra bhandar behatar he, kaccha tel sasta he or rajnatik sthirataa he
 There were already winds of crisis in the world
 apane vishaal property nivesh, mandi va ajeebogareeb banking ke saath, china 2013 se hi is sankat kii taraf khisak rahaa tha
 This is the third crisis after India's economic liberalization
 1997 main purvi asia ke karency sankat se bharat par doorgaami asar nahin padaa
 The banking and debt crisis in the US and Europe in 2008 also made India more secure
 ab china kii musiibat sir par tangi he
 India may be happy that the global turmoil will not affect us, but this crisis will decisively determine the future of India's growth
 pichley do sankaton ne bharat ko phaayde-nuksaanon kaa mila jula asar saunpa
 In 1997, when the currencies of the major countries of East Asia melted, there was an initial impact on India, but after that for the next seven years, the Indian economy changed its dress with the help of growth
 yah un bade sudhaaron kaa nateeja tha jo nabbe ke dashak ke madhya main hue or jinka phayda hamen vaastavik arthvyavastha main pratyaksh nivesh va growth ke taur par mila
 Till then, there was limited activity in India's stock markets
 2008 ke sankat ke baad america main byaaj daren ghatane se sasti puunji bah chali
 The last six years of reforms had raised expectations in emerging economies
 yahi vah daur tha jab bricks arthvyavasthaaen chamakin or bhartiya share bazaar niveshkon kaa tirth ban gaya
 Despite the apparent slowdown in the Indian economy, this investment continued till recently, reaching the peak in 2014 with the bugle of elections
 in tathyon ke sandarbh main taaja chunauti va avasar ko samajhnaa jaruri he
 The challenge: India's trouble is not the collapse of China, nor the global recession has made much difference except that exports have collapsed, which is already weak
 uljhan yah he ki america main byaaj daren badhate hi (isi maheene mumkin) videshi niveshak bharat sahit ubharate bazaaron se niklenge jahaan ve 2008 ke baad aae the, kyonki nivesh par hone vaale phaayde ghat jaaenge
 There is no growth in the real economy, so the profits of Indian companies cannot attract long-term investment
 yah pichley paanch saal main pehla mauka he jab visheshgy bharat sahit ubharate bazaaron main lambii giravat kaa sandesh de rahe hai
 Keep in mind that foreign investors have been a major source of dollars for India, so this farewell will be expensive
 yah feel good kii aakhri roshni he jo ab tuutane lagi he
 Opportunity: If time, economy size and global economy are separated, India is in a state of 1995 when GDP growth expectations were weak and there was no investment in stock markets
 alabatta videshi vyapaar, nivesh ke udaarikaran se lekar nijeekaran tak bharat ke sabhi bade dhanchaagat sudhaar 1995 se 2000 ke bich hue, jinka phayda global sankaton ke dauraan niveshkon ke bharose ke taur par mila
 The Modi government can fuel the next decade of Indian growth by making major structural reforms like the nineties
 vitt mantri thik kehete hai ki asli daaromadar vaastavik arthvyavastha par hi he
 Now the stock market will also accelerate on the strength and real growth of companies and not on cheap foreign capital
 is sankat ke baad bharat ke paas do vikalp hai: pehla, sudhaar rahit 6
 The average growth rate of 5-7 percent is what you can call the 21st century Hindu growth rate
 vishaal khapat or kuch global maang ke sahare (sookhaa aadi sankaton ko chhodkar) growth isse neeche nahin jaaegi
 The second is nine-ten per cent growth and growth in employment, facilities, income, which took place after 1997
 share bazaaron par global sankat kii dastak ke baad 8 sitambar ko jab pradhanmantri puure laav-lashkar ke saath udyogon ko jokhim lene kii naseehat de rahe the tab udhyami jarur yah kahana chaahate honge ki himmat dikhaane kii jarurat to sarkaar aapako he! pichley 15 maah main to sudhaaron kaa koi saahas nahin dikhaa he
 After rising interest rates in America, the shock of the crisis will intensify
 aglaa ek saal bataa degaa ki hamen 21veen sadi kii hindu growth rate milane vaali he yaa phir tarakkee kii tej udaan

 Micah Singh is one of the famous singers of Bollywood
 in dinon mika singh kaa ek video soshal media par teji se viral ho rahaa he
 The reason for this video going viral is not the strong performance of Micah Singh, but his performance
 darasal mika singh pakistan ke karachi shahar main ek khaas event main apni parformens dete najar aa rahe hai
 Tensions between India and Pakistan have increased a lot these days
 bharat ke bain lagane ke baad pakistan ne bhi indian artist par bain laga diya he
 In such a situation, concert of singer Micah Singh going to Karachi remains in the discussion
 pakistani singer fakir mahmud ne soshal media par mika kaa ek video share karte hue likhaa he, kashmir puri tarah se locdown he
 But an Indian singer comes, performs, earns money and goes away as if nothing has happened
 lekin dharm or deshbhakti to sirf garibon ke liye he
 Kashmir remains in complete lockdown but as free country we can do what we like
 Why not an Indian singer come, perform here, earns tax free $$$ and leave as did one yesterday
 But of course, religion and patriotism is for the poor

 He said that any type of content showing Indian tradition has been banned
 vaise isi saal jammu kashmir kii ghatana ke baad bharat ke film nirmaataaon ne apni ore se khud faisla liya tha ki wo pakistan main filmon kii screening nahin karenge
 Many producers had also announced not to release films in Pakistan

 Villagers beat up a Maoist who was shot dead after a Maoist shot and killed another of his accomplices on Friday night in Milky village under Barauni police station in Begusarai district of Bihar
 police adheekshak chhatranil singh ne shanivaar ko yahaan bataaya ki mritak maovadiyon main sikandar taanti or palaton taanti shaamil hai
 Police have taken the bodies of both the Maoists in their possession and sent them to the District Sadar Hospital for post-mortem
 unhone bataaya ki sikandar taanti ko uske saathi palaton taanti dwaara goli maare jane par graminon ne bhaag rahe palaton ko pakadakar peet-petakar maar daalaa

 The Delhi Police, who interrogated Kundra, claimed that Kundra accepted the betting but also lost a lot of money while doing so
 haal main bisisiai pad se istipha dene vaale jagadale ne kaha, ‘‘sattebaaji naitik rup se galat he kyonki aap ek team ke maalik hai
 Such things are not good for cricket nor for IPL
 bhartiya cricket premiyon kaa is khel par jo bharosa he, yah use khatm karne kii ek or ghatana he

 The government has not yet responded to the Memorandum of Procedure (MOP) for the appointment of Supreme Court judges
 samvidhan ke lihaaj se iske kya myne hai?sanvaidhanik peeth kaa aadesh yah he ki sarkaar ko memorandem par aakhri faisla lenaa hi hoga
 If the government does not take a decision, it means that it is not running as per the order of the constitutional bench
 jaj loya ke maamle se jis tarah nibata gaya, kya aap usase santusht hai?maamla sab jeudis (nyaayadhin) he
 It would be very wrong to say anything on this
 kya aap chaahati hai ki main jail chalaa jaaun?is saal maujuuda sijei ke khilaaf mahabhiyog chalaane kii maang kii gai
 But you have said that impeachment cannot be a solution? So what is the solution? Impeachment is a political process
 nyaayamurti karnan ke maamle main ek faisle main hamane kaha tha ki mahabhiyog nyaaypalika ke tamaam masalon kaa hal nahin ho saktaa
 There are deviations in the system
 or ek jaj kii kai kism kii asweekaarya gatividhiyaan ho sakati hai
 Suppose, one particular judge is corrupt, another is lazy, a third judge has absolutely no knowledge of the law
 mahabhiyog har cheez kaa jawaab nahin ho saktaa
 Unfortunately, the Constitution does not clearly state what to do
 is maamle main yaa to kanoon bananaa chahie yaa nyaaypalika ke str par tay kiya janaa chahie
 One has to develop some system
 nyaaypalika lagaataar badalane vaali sanstha he
 We should hope that the next generation of judges will debate these issues and deal with them
 march 2018 main sijei ko likhi apni chitthee main aapane do kanoonee diggajon lord bingham or justise robert jackson kaa hawala diya tha or nyaaypalika tathaa sarkaar ke bich kisi bhi meljol ko loktantr ke liye maut kii ghanti bataaya tha
 Is this one of your biggest concerns today? It has always been a matter of great concern
 loktantric samaaj main jarurat is baat kii he ki nyaaypalika kaa kaamkaaj puri tarah swatantra ho
 Anything that weakens this freedom can only be harmful to the credibility of this institution
 haal hi main aise maamle hue hai jinamein sarkaar ne jajon kii niyukti main collegium ke nirdeshon ko nazarandaaj kar diya
 Has this happened before? Yes, it has happened before
 kaaphi kuch maukon par us vakt kii sarkaron ne collegium kii siforeeshon ko andekha kar diya
 In fact, the 1993 Second Judge case was a response to this sequence
 karypalika or nyaaypalika ke bich yah takaraav kaaphi lambey vakt se chalaa aa rahaa he
 Why no solution could be found? The January press conference was an unprecedented event
 ham khud ise gaiyr-maamuli kehete hai
 But the confrontation between the executive and the judiciary is an ongoing process
 1970 ke dashak ke bare main sochie, jab supreme court ke teen jajon ko darkinar karke ek chauthe jaj ko pradhan nyaayadhish bana diya gaya tha
 Wasn't that a confrontation? Such conflicts will always go on, not only in our country, but in every democratic country
 aisa isliye he kyonki koi bhi sarkaar aakhirkaar har mumkin niyantran rakhana chaahegi
 It is with this understanding that constitutions are made and such explicit provisions are made in them which say that the judiciary must remain independent
 samvidhan ke nirmaataa, chaahe ve hamaare desh ke hon yaa duusare deshon ke, koi aise log nahin hai jo yun hi chaltau dhang se ek kanoonee dastavej taiyaar karte hon
 They are knowledgeable people, they know the history of mankind, the countries, what happened before, what kind of efforts the governments will make to keep the judiciary under control
 or ye koshishen hameshaa chalati rahengi
 This is the nature of power
 lord acton kii vah mashhoor baat yaad karen, "satta bhrasht karti he
 "what the confrontation will do will depend on how democratic the institutions are and how sensible the civil societies are
" hindustan ke supreme court ko aksar duniya kii sabase taqatvar adaalat kaha jaataa he
 Do you believe? i don't believe it
 kisi bhi adaalat kii takat aakhirkaar is baat par nirbhar karti he ki karypalika kanoon kii hukumat kaa kis had tak paalan karti he
 Recall that famous episode of American history during the Civil Wars when the Supreme Court issued a Habeas Corpus order and Lincoln's government refused to accept it
 supreme court is par bhala kya kar saktaa tha? sab kuch karypalika, nyaaypalika or samvidhan kii hidaayaton ke mutabik banaae gaye loktantric dhaanche ke tamaam hisson ke bich aapasi sammaan par nirbhar karata he
 Experts are saying that amidst the ongoing confrontation of judicial appointments in the collegium with your retirement, the functioning and direction of its functioning will change
 kya iskaa matlab collegium ke liye taabut kii keel hoga?main aisa nahin maanata
 If it is a system that is likely to end with a judge retiring, then it is a bad system
 mujhe yakeen he ki mere saathiyon ne jo shapath lee he us par khare utrenge or samvidhan kii raksha karenge
 What has brought me the greatest satisfaction of the tenure? i was able to play some role in the functioning of the democratic constitution of India
 main kitna kaamyaab rahaa, yah raay or akalan kii baat he
 People only find the spice in it, the January press conference, et cetera
 magar nyaayashastra ke lihaaj se kahuun, to ahm baat yah he ki mujhe 21 saal tak jaj ke taur par raashtra kii seva karne kaa mauka mila
 12 January is a small aspect of it
 kin mulyon ne aapako vah banaaya jo aap hai?do baton main meraa yakeen rahaa haih loktantr shashan kii sabase acchhee style he
 And that means equating disagreements
 ho saktaa he, main aapse sahamat na houn, par main aapke asahmat hone ke adhikaar kaa sammaan karata hum

 He said that seven central ministers of the state have been formed
 ve apane kshetra main acha kaam kaam kar sakate hai
 He was requested to accord special status to Bihar as recommended by Raghuram Rajan Committee
 maanjhi ne kaha ki bihar ke saaton kendriya mantri milakar bihar ko uskaa haq dilaa den, taaki ham bihar kaa pragati kii nai disha de saken
 To advance Bihar, eliminate poverty, unemployment and unemployment of Bihar and make it into the category of advanced states
 mukhyamantri ne kaha, ‘hamaara haq bhi kendra sarkaar nahin de rahi he
 We should get tax money and special state status for participation in tax
 jharkhand banane ke baad jo kshatipurti kii baarah hajaar karod rupee kii raashi tay kii gai thi, us mad main bhi paryaapt raash nahin mili he
 After the creation of Jharkhand, if the Center gives us the money for compensation, then we will be able to do a lot of development work

 The two-day talks on the Sir Creek maritime boundary dispute between India and Pakistan ended on Tuesday without significant progress
 yadhyapi donon pakshon ne vivaadit kshetra main bhoomi evam samudri seemaa ke liye ‘ek sauhardpurn samaadhaan’ talashne ke mudde par sahmati jataai
 The joint statement issued after the talks said, "the two sides discussed the demarcation of the land boundary in the Sir Creek area and the international maritime boundary between India and Pakistan
 ’bayaan main kaha gaya, ‘donon pakshon ne satat evam sakaaratmak vaarta ke jariye sar creek mudde kaa sauhardpurn samaadhaan talashne ke liye patibaddhta vyakt kii
 'the Indian side was led by secretary-general Swarna Subba Rao in the negotiations, while the Pakistani side was led by Rear Admiral Farooq Ahmed, Additional Secretary in the Ministry of Defense

 The next round of talks on the Sir Creek issue will be held in Pakistan
 sar creek kuccha ke ran main 96 kimi lambaa bhubhag he, jo bharat ke gujarat evam pakistan ke sindh praant ko alag karata he
 It is worth mentioning that the Sir Creek issue has been discussed after the talks on Siachen Glacier last week
 ye vaartaayen donon deshon dwaara vaarta prakriya shuru karne par bani sahmati kaa hissaa hai
 In February last year, the two countries agreed to start the dialogue process
 dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke baad astitv main aae sanyukt raashtra (united Nations) kii suraksha parishad main duniya ke 5 kaddavar desh america, rus, france, china or united kingdom ko jagah mili
 These countries are also called Permanent Five
 bharat lambey samay se is elite club main shaamil hone kii jaddojahad kar rahaa he
 Technically, his claim is made and most countries of the P-5 have accepted it openly
 sawaal uth rahaa he ki kya maujuuda vaishvik paristhitiyaan bharat ko suraksha parishad main bataur pi-6 shaamil karne ke sabase mufeed hai?beete kai dashakon se duniyabar main suraksha parishad ke vistaar kii maang chal rahi he or is daud main bharat sabase aage he
 Even before independence, India as a founding member signed the Washington Declaration on 1 January 1942 to bring the United Nations into existence and agreed to play an important role in all efforts for world peace
 sanyukt raashtra main bharat ke pehle pratinidhi sar e ramasvami mudaliyaar the
 The current P-5 members being economic and military power, as well as the countries of the world established after World War II, were given responsibility by the United Nations to eliminate the possibility of the Third World War
 sanyukt raashtra ke nirmaan ke vakt china ko chhodkar chaaron desh dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke vijeta samooh main the or badi aarthik or sainya shakti hone ke kaaran inhone vishwa shanti ko sthapit karne main apni ahm sakriyata nirdhaarit kii
 For the first time after independence, India became a temporary member of the United Nations Security Council in 1950–51
 suraksha parishad main pi-5 ke alaava 10 asthaayee sadsy hai or sadsy desh do varshon ke liye inkaa chunaav karte hai
 India has joined the Security Council 7 times till three years after independence (1950–51, 1967–68, 1972–73, 1977–78, 1984–85, 1991–92 and 2011–12)
 china se vyapaar ghaataa america or bharat ko ek saath laa rahaa he?suraksha parishad main is bhoomika ke baavjood pehali baar 1971 main bharat ko suraksha parishad main sthaayee sadsy na hone kii kami khali
 At this time, India played an important role in liberating Bangladesh from Pakistan
 iske baavjood duniya ke sabase bade loktantr bharat ko sabase puraane or taqatvar loktantr america se chunauti mili
 Standing in favor of Pakistan, the US sent a warship enterprise equipped with its Navy's most powerful Seventh Fleet fighter aircraft to help Pakistan in the Indian Ocean
 iske saath hi tatkaaleen america videsh mantri henry kisinger ne bangladesh kii aazaadee ke liye hui jang main bharat ko yuddh kaa kaaran tak qaraar diya
 However, the then Soviet Union (russia) did the work to save India from this assault of P-5 members in the Security Council, which, using its veto power, stopped the US move against India
 haalanki yah vaakya ab itihaas ho chukaa he lekin yaheen se bharat kii suraksha parishad main shaamil hone kii daud shuru hui
 In this race of the Security Council, former Prime Minister of India Indira Gandhi thrice (1972-73, 1977-78, 1984-85) gave the country a temporary seat in the Security Council
 iske baad purv pradhanmantri vishwanath pratap singh ne 1991-92 main bharat ko chhathi baar or phir purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne 2011-12 main saatvin baar desh ko suraksha parishad main pahunchaaya
 Through all these efforts for a temporary seat, India's strong claim for a permanent seat in the Security Council was presented
 beete dashakon main hue in prayaason ke chalate aaj sanyukt raashtra ke paanch sthaayee sadasyon main se chaar sadsy america, rus, france or united kingdom bharat ko pi-6 banane ke liye taiyaar hai lekin china lagaataar iskaa virodh kar rahaa he
 Apart from the Security Council, the infamous 'coffee Club' (uniting for Consensus) is active with China's support to oppose India's membership in the General Assembly of the United Nations
 is club main argentina, canada, colombia, costa rika, italy, malta, mexico, pakistan, korea republic, san marino, spain or turki shaamil he
 Along with India, this coffee club is opposing any extension of the Security Council
 modi kaa masterstroke?kendra kii satta par kabiz bhartiya janata party ke liye bharat ko suraksha parishad main jagah dilaanaa praathamikta he
 The party in its manifesto has pledged to make India a permanent member of the UN Security Council
 iske saath hi lagbhag 100 desh kii yatra ke dauraan piem modi ne is praathamikta par badhat banane kaa mauka nahin choda
 Addressing the United Nations General Assembly on 25 September 2015, Modi called for India to be given an active role in the Security Council, changing the Security Council to the challenges of the 21st century
 jahaan suraksha parishad main chaar sadsy america, rus, france or united kingdom samay-samay par bharat ko shaamil kiye jane kii vakaalat kar chuke hai, vahiin hameshaa virodh main baithne vaale china ke rukh main kuch sahajata darj kii gai he
 After the visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping to India in September 2014, a statement from the Indian Ministry of External Affairs stated that the Chinese government supports the inclusion of India in the Security Council
 iske saath hi kaha gaya ki china sarkaar kaa maananaa he ki maujuuda samay main antarrashtriya str par bharat kii ahm bhoomika he
 Outside, other than this statement of the Foreign Ministry, there is still a major achievement in this regard at diplomatic level from China
 haal main jis tarah bharat ne china ko uske van belt van road pariyojna main peeche dhakelne kaa kaam karte hue china ko saaf sanket diya he ki uski kisi bhi badi pariyojna kii safalataa tabhi tay hogi jab bharat us pariyojna ke paksh main khadaa he
 China needs more support of India against the US in the trade war that started due to the policies of US President Donald Trump
 aise main bharat ke liye china ko baatcheet kii mej par baitaane or suraksha parishad main seat ke liye raji karne ke pehle se behatar maukey hai
 Now according to the real politics on the United Nations platform, India can get permanent membership only if the five permanent member countries stand in favor of India
 itnaa hi nahin in paanch deshon main kam se kam ek desh aisa ho jo bharat kii daavedaari ke liye aam sabha main sadsy deshon ke bich ahm bhoomika adaa kare
 In such a situation where the activities of the coffee club will be helped to be disabled, the way of entry in the Security Council of India will be cleared

 hindi shikshak sun rahe hai? The disappointing defeat in the Test series against England proved a boon for the left-handed batsman Suresh Raina, who revived the lifeless Indian team, and through practice at Astroturf in Lucknow, he removed his known weakness in playing short-pitched balls
 By gaining new confidence
 short pich genden raina kii sabase badi kamajori maani ja rahi thi, lekin lakhanu ke guru gobind singh sports kalege ke estrotarf par kade abhyaas ke baad vah isse nijaat paane main safal rahe
 The result of this was that he gave a new confidence in the Indian team by performing a pull shot on short pitch balls of fast bowlers like James Anderson on England's pitch
 raina ko cricket kaa kakehara sikhaane vaale coach deepak sharma ne kaha, 'raina kii short pich genden khilne kii takanic ko lekar pehle bhi kaaphi baaten hoti rahi hai
 Fast bowlers used to put up a net of short pitch balls to dismiss them
 ab raina ke liye bounsar koi apratyaashit cheez nahin rah gai he
 Now he has understood that fast bowlers will only throw short pitch balls to him
 iske liye unhone khaas taiyaari kii thi
 ' unhone bataaya 'england jane se pehle 15 din pehle raina sports kalege main abhyaas ke liye aae the
 The sports college also has an astroturf on which synthetic ball bounces
 maine unke saath kaaphi samay estrotarf par abhyaas karaane main bhi bitaayaa
 Raina practiced short pitch balls with full enthusiasm here, which benefited him a lot
 mujhe unka aatmavishvaas dekhakar laga ki kuch nayaa saamne aane vaala he or ab raina bilkul badla hua khilaadi lag rahaa he
 ' raina shrunkhlaa main ab tak teen maichon kii do pariyon main 71 ke ausat se 142 ran bana chuke hai
 He has also taken three wickets while bowling economically
 iske alaava damdaar fielding karte hue teen kaich bhi pakad chuke hai
 Sharma said that the Indian team was indeed in a losing mood, so Raina gave a new thought and new enthusiasm to the team by scoring a century in the first match
 abhi unase kai uplabdhiyaan hasil karne kii ummid kii ja sakati he
 He said that Raina has entered a new phase of maturity as a player and his performance could open the doors of the Test team for him
 sharma ne kaha 'mere hisaab se isi tarah kii paripakvata or lay banaaye rakhane ke liye raina ko apana swaabhaavik andaaj kaayam rakhana chahie or prayogon se bachanaa chaiye
 He is an aggressive batsman and should not change his mind
 ' The coach said, "raina has matured even as a bowler
 vah ballebaaj ke dimag ko padhakar gend phenkata he
 i always told him that your bowling will support your batting and bowling

 Sharad Yadav has claimed that 500 members attended the National Council meeting he convened in New Delhi, this is beyond reality

 Sinha said that we all know how the people of India reacted to the Emergency which was 'the most powerful democratic effort in our country to maintain the tone of disagreement'
 ’ samaaj main samvaad roak na diya jaae, yah sunishchit karne kii jarurat par yechuri ke hastkshep par sinha ne kaha, ‘main sirf itnaa kahuunga ki adnga lagane vaala gambhir mushkil main he

 His promise of providing cheap electricity and water remained unfulfilled and the matter of eradicating corruption had just begun, so he resigned

 The people of Mumbai may be impressed by the promises he made to the people of Delhi, but the number of fans ahead of him is very less

 But recently Transparency International has inflicted a lot of injury on him by claiming that his claims are hollow, which will take him a long time to recover
 kejariwal narendra modi par khulkar pehle to hamalaa nahin kar rahe the lekin baad main ve un par bhi waar karne lage or unke khilaaf bhi muhim main jute gaye
 But such a direct attack on Modi is useless because he has been accused of other charges but he is like leaders like Nitish Kumar, Mamta Banerjee in terms of honesty
 un par aise ungali uthaakar kejariwal ne ek galat number dial kiya he
 He is nervous about Modi's popularity or what he calls marketing
 unki ghabrahat saaf dikh rahi he or isliye ‘uski kameez meri kameez se safed kaise’ ke tarj par wo modi par bhi keechad oochaal rahe hai
 But in this battle, Modi is sitting in the front row heroes and following his tricks like a skilled general
 vah jan samarthan ko or badhaane ke liye teji se prachaar karte ja rahe hai jisamen congress ke mahabali rahul gandhi bhi pichhadate dikh rahe hai
 Rahul Gandhi, undoubtedly filled with good feelings, has come to the field with the promise of eradicating corruption but he has nothing to say
 unki party ne unhen kuch aisa nahin diya he jinke aadhaar par vah is jang ko jeet lene kaa dambh bharen
 They look completely on the backfoot
 150 saal se bhi zyada puraani party kaa poorja-poorja is samay hilaa hua dikh rahaa he
 Rahul Gandhi is not a clever and playful player of politics like Narendra Modi
 ve sidhe taur par apni baat rakhane ke liye jane jate hai lekin ab uske liye vakt bahut kam bachaa he
 The biggest thing is that his party has left no stone unturned to embarrass him
 2ji ghotaalaa, kolgate vagairah kii kaali chaaya se party ko nikaalane main ve kitna safal honge, ye to samay hi batayega
 Modi is recognizing his weaknesses and showing the dream of a better India and no one is seen before him
 baharhaal abhi kuch bhi kahana jaldbaaji hi nahin galat bhi hoga
 Right now it can be said that Modi is running like a rudder mounted gallop and the challengers are still behind
 vakt hi faisla karegaa ki koun aage rahegaa or koun pichad jayega

 As per the new rules, the applicant has to personally go to the passport office where details of his body's unique identity such as fingerprint, eye color and any birthmark etc

 BJP is trying to connect directly with the voters through Bharat Vijay rally
 basapa mukhiya mayawati ne yah kahkar gathbandhan se duuri bana lee he ki loksabhaa chunaav main sapa kaa vot hi unhen transfar nahin hua
 Which did not help the coalition and now his party will contest the by-election on its own
 lekin loksabhaa chunaav main vot share ke aankade kuch or hi gavaahi dete hai
 Comparing the sp-bsp's vote share during the 2019 and 2014 Lok Sabha elections in the 15 seats out of 80 in which the alliance won, shows that the votes of the two parties in each of the 14 seats, except one seat, Transferred
 tabhi modi lahar main bhi gathbandhan 15 siten bachaane main kaamyaab rahaa
 Contrary to Mayawati's claim, SP lost the Mainpuri seat, while on the Kannauj seat, it did not get the full BSP vote
 is baar loksabhaa chunaav main basapa or sapa ne kramshah 38 or 37 siton par chunaav ladaa tha
 Out of which the BSP managed to win 10 out of 38
 basapa ne jo das siten jeetin hai, vahaan uske khate main sapa kaa 2014 vaala vot share judaa he
 Similarly, in four of the five seats of SP, the bsp's 2014 vote share is linked
 sapa ke ek netaa kaa kahana he ki agar vot share nahin hua hota to kaise basapa shunya se 10 siten jeet gai
 The loss was made by the SP, which was limited to five seats of five
 basapa ko vot transfar hone ke ye rahe saboot2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main gajipur main basapa ne kul 51
 Won with 2 percent vote share
 jabaki 2014 main basapa kaa vot share sirf 27
 Was 82
 vahiin sapa kaa vot share 24
 Was 49 percent
 is prakaar dekhen to is seat par 2014 kii tulana main basapa kaa 22
 The vote share increased by 26 percent
 jaahir si baat he ki yah vot sapa se hi shift hua hoga
 Take for example the Bijnor seat
 yahaan bhi basapa ko jeet mili
 BSP just 26 in 2014
 51 pratishat vot share mila tha, jabaki 2019 main 50
 97 percent vote share
 yani basapa ke vot share main 24
 There was a jump of 46 percent
 yah oochaal sapa kaa vot judane se hi aayaa
 Similarly, if we look at the Jaunpur seat, here too the BSP managed to win on the basis of sp's vote share
 2014 main basapa kaa yahaan vot share tha 17
 87 percent and 21 of SP
 93 pratishat
 Whereas in 2019 the alliance got 50
 08 pratishat vot share rahaa
 Thus, on the basis of the alliance, the BSP increased its vote share to 32 from 2014
 21 pratishat badhaane main safal rahi
 Similarly 54 at Lalganj
 01 pratishat vot share hasil kar basapa ne seat jholii main daali
 Whereas in 2014, the bsp's vote share here was just 29
 04 pratishat tha
 26 of 2014 to BSP in Shravasti
 55 pratishat ke mukaable 44
 The BSP won on the basis of sp's votes in Ambedkar Nagar, Amroha, Nagina and Saharanpur Lok Sabha seats also got 31 percent votes
 agar sapa kaa vot nahin miltaa to ye 10 siten kaise akele jeet paati basapa?mainpuri main ho gaya khel'sapa ne jo paanch siten jeetin, usamen mainpuri iklauti seat rahi, jahaan basapa ke vot share ke bagaiyr usne jiti
 Shockingly, SP also got its own vote on this seat
 mainpuri main 2014 main jab mulaayam singh yadav lade the to 59
 SP got 64 percent vote share, while BSP got 14 votes
 29 pratishat tha
 Thus, in 2014 the vote share of both the parties was 73 in total
 93 pratishat tha
 But in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the SP got only 53
 75 pratishat vot mili
 Whereas in 2014 SP alone got 59
 64 pratishat vot mili the
 That is, leave aside the bsp's vote, the SP has its own 5 compared to the last time
 89 pratishat vot kam mila
 In Azamgarh, sp's vote was transferred to SP
 pichhali baar jab mulaayam singh yadav lade the to 35
 It won by getting 340306 votes with 44 percent vote share
 magar is baar akhilesh yadav ne 60
 Won by winning 4 percent vote share and 621578 votes
 sapa ke khate me 24
 96 percent vote share added
 2014 main basapa ke 27
 It was 76 percent of the vote
 is prakaar dekhen to yahaan bhi vot transfar hua
 Talking about the seats of Samajwadi Party, a total of five seats were received
 isamen muradabad kii baat karen to 66 pratishat vot pade
 35 to Samajwadi Party last time
 26 pratishat vot share mila tha
 50 this time to the alliance
 65 pratishat rahaa
 Last time bsp's vote share here was 14
 27 pratishat rahaa
 Thus, sp-bsp's vote share of 49 in 2014
 53 pratishat tha
 While 50 in 2010
 65 pratishat rahaa
 That is, in Moradabad, the voters of both parties voted
 rampur main 2014 main sapa kaa vot share 35
 05 and bsp's vote share 8
 47 rahaa
 Thus, sp-bsp's vote share of 43 in 2014
 52 pratishat rahaa
 While 52 in 2019
 71 rahaa
 Which shows that votes and transfers also took place in Rampur
 kannauj main dimple ko nahin mili basapa ke puure voteaankadon se pataa chalata he ki kannauj main akhilesh kii patni dimple yadav ne bhale hi is baar zyada vot hasil kiye hon, magar unhen basapa kaa puraa vot nahin mila
 Which caused defeat
 2014 main dimple ko 4,89164 vot or basapa ko 1,27785 vot mili the
 Thus the total votes of SP and BSP in 2014 is 6,16,949
 jabaki 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main dimple yadav ko 550,734 vot hi mili
 That is, after the alliance, Dimple Yadav could add only 61,788 votes
 jabaki basapa ko 2014 main 1
 Over 27 lakh votes were received
 vahiin bijepi ummidavaar subrat pathak ne 2014 main mili 469257 vot ke aankade ko 563087 pahunchaakar jeet hasil kii
 It is being said that the SP got half the vote of the BSP and half the non-jatav Dalit vote went to the BJP
