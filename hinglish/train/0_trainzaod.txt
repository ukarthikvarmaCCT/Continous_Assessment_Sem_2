 Frustrated by the spot-fixing episode and other controversies related to the Indian Premier League, the breathtaking T20 league chairman Rajeev Shukla said he was not willing to accept the post again
 shukla ne kaha ki unka kaarykaal shuruyaat main ek saal ke liye tha jiskaa prayek varsh navinikaran kiya janaa tha
 He, however, said that he is not keen to continue in this prestigious position for a third consecutive term
 shukla ne kaha, ‘ipel pramukh kaa pad ek saal ke liye hota he jiskaa vaarshik aam baithak main har saal navinikaran kiya jaataa he lekin meri tisare saal is pad par bane rahane kii koi ichha nahin he
 He said, 'I do not crave any position in BCCI, my job was to organize matches and the matches were very well organized
 vivaadon ke baavjood stadium khachaakhach bhare the
 The IPL chairman said, "I have never run after any position
 jab mujhe ipel chairman kaa pad diya gaya to maine ise chunauti ke rup main liya or apni sarvshereshth kshamta ke saath apana kaam kiya
 Shukla said that there was a lot of discussion among the board members on the continuation of n Srinivasan as BCCI president after the spot-fixing case
 unhone kaha, ‘bisisiai ke sadasyon ke bich pehle hi charchaa ho chuki he or philhal hamaari chintaa bisisiai or bhartiya cricket kii chhavi kii raksha karnaa he
 Shukla's refusal to accept the post may put additional pressure on Srinivasan, who has refused to step down, stating that he did nothing wrong
 pichley saal chiraayu amin kii jagah ipel adhyaksh bane shukla ne kaha ki spot phixing prakaran ke saamne aane se pehle tak toornament thik chal rahaa tha or ab sabase mahatvapurn cheez saakh barkaraar rakhane kii he
 He said, 'because of the mistakes of some players and some people, the names of hundreds of players participating in IPL cannot and should not be spoiled
 kuch laalchee vyaktiyon kii vajah se ipel kii saakh par batta nahin lagaaya ja saktaa
 Asked what steps should be taken to maintain the credibility of the tournament, Shukla said, "the anti-corruption Unit should work closely with police agencies
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘sattebaajon par najar rakhana police kaa kaam he
 The second suggestion, which i have already accepted, is that an officer of the anti-corruption and Security Unit should be included with each team during the tournament as it will be able to identify a wrong player
 ’shukla ne kaha, ‘teesraa suzav he ki jo bhi pakadaa jaye, use kanoon ke mutabik kadi sajaa di jaye
 This will give them a lesson
 antim yah he ki khilaadiyon ke anubandh main ek praavdhaan hona chahie ki koi bhi agar bhrashtachar main lipt paaya jaataa he to us par aapraadhik mukadmaa chalaanaa chahie
 Shukla said that anti-corruption activities did not come under his purview as his job as IPL chairman was to organize tournaments
 unhone kaha, ‘bhrashtachar rodhi gatividhiyaan puri tarah se isisi or bisisiai kii jimmedaari he
 This is the reason why the ICC and BCCI were monitoring the ACSU IPL
 ve ipel pramukh ke daayre main nahin hai tathaa isisi or bisisiai kaa report karte hai
 Following this episode, the BCCI has formed a three-member committee which is investigating the allegations leveled against Gurunath Meiyappan, the son-in-law of board chief n Srinivasan and team principal of Chennai Super Kings
 mayppan ko sattebaaji ke aarope main giraftaar kiya gaya he

 Shukla said, 'my view is that BCCI should be bound to accept the recommendations of the three-member commission
 isaki jaanch ke nateezon ko bisisiai kii kaary samiti ke paas nahin bheja janaa chahie
 "he said," As far as Srinivasan is concerned, our view is that he should disassociate himself from the entire process till the investigation is pending
 unhen sabhi tarah ke kaamkaaj se dur rahanaa chahie jisase ki swatantra or nishpaksh jaanch ko sake
 When asked if he had any idea about spot-fixing in the IPL, Shukla said, "if i had any information i would not have let this happen
" hamen koi andaja nahin tha ki aisa kuch ho rahaa he

 mangalvaar din bhar upi bijepi ke sheersh netaa rajya kii loksabhaa kii sabhi 80 siton ke liye ummidavaaron kii suchi ko antim rup dene ke liye dilli main jute rahe or rajya prabharee amit shah ke saath maathapai hoti rahi
 Most candidates from the state are likely to be declared in the Central Election Committee meeting to be held on March 8 and 13
 yah tay mana ja rahaa he ki party adhyaksh rajnath singh gajiabad ke bajaae lakhanu se chunaav ladenge, lekin narendra modi kii banaras se ummidavaari ko lekar abhi tasviir saaf nahin ho pai he
 Most of the leaders of the state BJP want Modi to contest from Banaras or Lucknow
 rajnath ke lakhanu jane kii baat tay hone se ab banaras kii hi seat modi ke liye bachati he
 On the other hand, Bihar BJP leaders want Modi to contest from Patna, but he says that if Modi fights with Benaras too, it will have an impact in many parts of Bihar and BJP will get strength
 bijepi ke ranneetikaron kaa maananaa he ki is chunaav main uttar pradesh, bihar or maharashtra sabase mahatvapurn rajya hai
 For the BJP to perform well in up-bihar, it is necessary that Modi should contest from UP
 amit shah yah baat khule taur par kah chuke hai
 Murali Manohar Joshi is currently a party MP from Banaras and is not ready to give up his seat
 lekin party kaa kahana he ki agar modi ke banaras se chunaav ladane kaa faisla hota he, to joshi ko kanpur se chunaav ladane ke liye manaa liya jayega
 At the same time, the Gujarat BJP has made it clear that Modi will have to fight the state
 use lagata he ki uske 'mishan 26' ke liye yah behad jaruri he
 According to sources, Narendra Modi himself also wants BJP from Gujarat to win the maximum number of Lok Sabha seats this time
 modi ke liye ahmedabad purv yaa vadodara kaa naam sujhaayaa gaya he
 BJP sources say that Modi will fight UP or not, but will contest the Lok Sabha elections from Gujarat under all circumstances
 to sawaal yahi khadaa hota he ki modi ek seat se ladenge yaa phir do siton se? do siton se chunaav ladanaa koi nai baat nahin he
 Indira Gandhi herself has contested two Lok Sabha seats, but there is a constitutional obligation that a person can be a member of Lok Sabha from only one seat
 yani agar vah donon siten jeetta he, to use ek seat se istipha dena padegaa
 That is why it is being asked that if Modi stands from both UP and Gujarat, which seat will he resign in case he wins from both places? aam aadmi party kii ore se sanket mila he ki uske netaa arvind kejariwal banaras se narendra modi ke khilaaf chunaav lard sakate hai
 According to analysts, when this happens, the opposition parties like Congress, SP-BSP can try to make Modi's fight harder by supporting Kejriwal
 yah bhi mana ja rahaa he ki aisa hone par kejariwal ko jabardast prachaar milegaa or iske boote unki party desh ke duusare hisson main bhi kai siton par mukaable main aati dikh jaaegi
 But BJP strategists do not give much preference to Kejriwal's chances of contesting elections
 unka maananaa he ki arvind kejariwal surkhiyaan batorne kaa koi mauka nahin chodenge or jaruri nahin he ki modi ke sirf gujarat se hi chunaav ladane par vah vahaan se unke khilaaf khadey na hon, balki modi kahin se bhi chunaav laden, kejariwal unke khilaaf maidan main utar sakate hai
 Therefore, the BJP cannot decide on the basis of Kejriwal's chances of contesting elections or his mathematics
 aakhir main party main yahi tay hua he ki is bare main antim faisla narendra modi khud hi karen
 Decide whether he will fight from one seat or two
 yaa vah sirf gujarat se ladenge athwa upi se bhi
 It is certain that whatever decision Modi will make in this regard will be done keeping in mind the electoral gains and losses and not to correct the internal equations of the BJP as a section of the party wants
 aisi sambhaavna he ki modi kii ummidavaari kaa elaan party sabase aakhir main kare

 jammu-kashmir ke cricketer parvej rasul ko zimbabwe ke khilaaf paanchaven or antim van-de match main bhi antim ekadash main jagah nahin mili
 25-year-old Pervez Rasool has become the only player of Team India on this tour, who did not get a chance to play a single match
 is puure daure par team india main kai yuva khilaadi shaamil kiye gaye the, taaki bharat ko apane bench strength ko aajamaane kaa mauka mili

 He tweeted whether Rasul was taken to Zimbabwe only to drop his morale

 *** desh main in dinon bhagwaan hanuman lagaataar charchaa main hai or unki charchaa kaa vishay unki jati ko lekar he
 Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had called Hanuman a Dalit during the Rajasthan assembly elections, after which political rhetoric about his caste has started
 koi unhen dalit, koi musalmaan or koi unhen jat kaa bataa rahaa he, lekin ab saansad kirti aaazaad ne unhen chini bataa diya he
 On this issue, Kirti Azad said, 'hanuman ji was Chinese
 har jagah yah afvaah ud rahaa he ki chini log daawa kar rahe hai ki hanuman ji chini the
 At the same time, BJP MP Udit Raj called Hanuman a tribal
 hanuman kii jati ko lekar bijepi netaa tarah-tarah kii bayaanbaji par rahe hai
 Uttar Pradesh's charitable affairs minister Lakshmi Narayan Chaudhary told Hanuman a Jat during a debate in the Legislative Council
 unhone kaha tha, 'jo dusron ko dikkat main dekhakar kud padate hai, vah jat hi ho saktaa he
 Hence Hanuman was a Jat
 ' haalanki unki is daleel ko sunakar sadan main baithe vipakshi dalon ne hangaamaa machaana shuru kar diya
 Bukkal said - Hanuman was a Muslim, before this, BJP MLA Bukkal Nawab gave a unique statement about Bhimanuman's caste
 unhone kaha ki hanuman muslim the
 Therefore, the names of Muslims are placed on Rahman, Ramadan, Farhan, Suleiman, Salman, Zishan, Qurbaan
 bijepi ke vidhayak bukkal nawab ne hanuman ko dalit bataae jane par uthe vivaad kaa zikr karte hue kaha ki hanuman kii jati par baat hoti he
 So it should also be seen from which religion he belonged
 meraa maananaa he ki hanuman ji muslim the
 Therefore, the name that is given inside Muslims is similar to Hanuman
 hanuman kii jaatiko lekar sabase pehla bayaan upi ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne diya tha jisamen unhone 27 november ko alvar main chunavi raily main bhaashan ke dauraan hanuman ko dalit bataaya tha
 He had said that Hanuman was a forest dweller, deprived and a Dalit
 unke is bayaan ke baad siyaasi galiyaaron main jamkar virodh shuru ho gaya
 After this statement of Yogi Adityanath, everyone started describing Hanuman's caste on their own level
 rashtriya anusuchit janajati ayog (ensiasti) ke adhyaksh nand kumaar saay ne hanuman ko adivasee bataaya tha
 Whereas Baba Ramdev said that Hanuman is knowledgeable of Ashta Siddhi as well as Kshatriya
 kendriya mantri satyapal songh ne hanuman ko dalit nahin arya bataaya to shankaracharya swami swaroopanand saraswati ne unhen brahman bataaya
 BJP leader and Rajya Sabha MP Gopal Narayan Singh even went as far as to say that Hanuman was a monkey and a monkey is an animal, which is even lower than a Dalit
 wo to ram ne unhen bhagwaan bana diya
 Political rhetoric about Hanuman continues
 arnest ne kaha ki donon hi deshon main maujuud united stats agency for international deveopment (uasaid) unki jaruratein puri karne main madad kii koshish kar sakati he
 There are a sufficient number of emergency shelter and relief supply kits in warehouses throughout Afghanistan
 unhone kaha, pakistan main, uasaid ke maujuuda sahyogi jarurat padane par madad ke liye taiyaar hai
 We definitely have some things that can be helpful
 is bhayaavah sthiti se nipat rahi sarkaron kii harsambhav madad karne ke liye ham taiyaar khadey hai
 State Department spokesman John Kirby said he was not aware of any request from the United States for help in this regard
 uasaid ke kaaryvahak prabandhak alphonso i lenheart ne kaha, ham afghanistan or pakistan main mauton or tabaahi kii khabaron se behad dukhi hai
 The US is ready to help if these governments request international help
 unhone kaha, uasaid ke paas prabhavit deshon or washington main aapadaa visheshgy hai, jo ki sthiti par najar banaakar rakhe hue hai or sarkari adhikariyon evam maanavtaavaadi sahyogiyon ke sampark main hai
 "USAID has a glorious history of working to improve lives in Afghanistan and Pakistan and we remain committed to supporting the region even after this disaster," he said

 ghoomte-ghoomte hi zyaada siikhaa ja saktaa he
 From this point of view you can also see the journey of speeches of Prime Minister Narendra Modi between United Nations and SAARC
 aaj saarc sammelan main diya gaya unka bhaashan sanyukt raashtra sangh sammelan main jamaa dene kii kala se kahin zyaada behatar or paripakv tha
 Even those who criticize the Prime Minister's foreign visits can see practical possibilities for the SAARC region in the spirit of his speech today
 aaj ke bhaashan ne vaicharik bahason se gaayab ho chuke saarc ko waapas centre main laa diya he
 i look at the diplomacy and utility of these foreign forums with skepticism
 iskaa ek bada kaaran he ki meraa in muddon se kabhi naata nahin rahaa
 It is not that all these forums are ineffective, but at times it seems that the things spoken here are ideal, but they do not have any special qualitative effect
 in bhaashanon se sampadakeey to bhar jate hai, magar zamin par vaisaa kuch nahin badalata
 Despite accepting this suspiciousness, i believe that the Prime Minister's speech was good
 main ateet or bhavishya kii baaten nahin jaanata, isliye ek running camentry kii tarah ise likh rahaa hum
 The Prime Minister's speech does present a point of departure for at least one ideological establishment
 mujhe nahin maaloom ki pehle ke kisi vaktaa ne in bhaawanaaon ko vyakt kiya he yaa nahin, or kiya he, to unka kya hua, lekin pradhanmantri jab bol rahe the to haul main baithe logon ke chehre par tahaltey camaron ne kaaphi kuch dikhaa diya
 There was a kind of positivity
 videshmantri sushamaa swaraj bhi stabdh nazar aa rahi thim! manch par nepal ke pradhanmantri ke peeche baithe unke do sahyogiyon ke chehre par bhi khaas kism kaa nikhaar tha
 He was not making India the head of his words, but was saying that now the conflict is over, they work together
 bhaashan to khatm hua pradhanmantri ke chir-parichit jumalebaazi kii style main ki ham paas-paas hai, par saath-saath nahin hai
 Being together increases manifold strength
 aise jumalon se vah aam jan main sambhaavnaaon kii tasviir to khinch hi dete hai
 But the beginning part of this speech was also quite good
 main aatankwaad se ladane or uske khatare ke routine pravachanon kii baat nahin kar rahaa
 i am talking about the part that revives the dead SAARC
 pradhanmantri modi saarc ko avasaron kaa kshetra bana dena chaahate hai
 He wants to connect these areas
 aisa karne ke liye vah sirf dusron ko bhaashan nahin de rahe hai, balki bharat kii bhi kamazori gina rahe hai
 Due to all these things, the aspect of honesty starts to emerge in the speech
 modi kehete hai ki main jab sadak maarg ke zariye janakapur jane kii baat karata hum to afasaron main ghabrahat fail jaati he
 That is because the roads on the border are very bad
 main chahta hum ki ye behatar ho jaaen
 i want to improve the facilities at the border, so that the business can speed up
 aisa karte hue pradhanmantri bahut saavdhaanee se saarc deshon ke sambandhon ko utpaadak or upabhokta main badal dete hai
 Due to the border dispute, the bitter relations of citizens of SAARC countries change from producer and consumer to whether the distance between producer and consumer cannot be reduced
 modi kaa rashtrawaad darasal bijnesavad he
 Do business and provide all the facilities for doing business properly
 isi se rojgaar penpega or sabakaa bhala hoga
 Prime Minister Modi said that even within India and many times between India and Pakistan's Punjab, some goods cover such a distance that it not only becomes expensive but also takes a lot of time
 lekin yah duuri to tabhi dur hogi, jab pradhanmantri raajnneetik utaavlepan ke dabaav main aakar baat-baat main pakistan ke saath baatcheet band nahin karenge
 To improve these relations one has to be taken to the negotiating table in a condition free environment
 agar yah aasaan hota to isi sammelan main pradhanmantri swayan pahal kar nawaz sharif ko baahon main bhar lete
 With the construction of a road on the border, relations do not get better, but also due to doubt
 itane achche bhaashan ke baad modi ko sangh or virdohi dalon ke dabaav se nikalakar pakistan ko vaise hi daavat de deni chahie thi, jaise unhone apane shapathgrahan samaaroh ke vakt diya tha
 Neither Modi nor Nawaz Sharif will be able to break free from their domestic political reality
 pradhanmantri ne saarc deshon se yah bhi kaha ki unhen pataa he ki aapke saath vyapaar main bharat kaa palada baari he
 The trade surplus is in India's favor, but it cannot run
 vyapaar main santulan hona chahie
 By saying this, they hold a thread of trust to the SAARC countries that at least a new opportunity can be given to these relations
 vah kehete hai ki aaj khud se yah sawaal karne kii zarurat he ki duniya main dakshin asia kahaan he
 We should not look at each other with suspicion and negative attitude
 jo sapana main bharat ke liye dekhtaa hum, vahi puure ilaake ke liye dekhtaa hum
 Neighbors are good, this is the desire of the whole world
 kul milakar modi ne saarc deshon ko jhakzora he ki agar ham europe kii tarah ek-duusare se jud jaaen, vyapaar or logon kaa avaagaman bad jaae to saarc sambhaavnaaon kaa kshetra ban jayega

 i was heading towards Kannauj, sitting in a packed bus in thundering rain with thundering clouds and my memories were running towards childhood
 mere kaanon main ek aawaaj gunjane lagi
 Every evening, a large box of perfume bottles around the neck, the sound of the perfume hanging in a leg

 My grandmother used to buy perfume from him according to the changing season and said that memories are most associated with smell

 Suddenly the hoarse voice of the horn of the bus dissolved my sleep

 The bus landed me on the main road and left ahead, leaving it with diesel smoke and mud

 The issue of Section 370 did not sideline: BJPBJP today said that it has neither curtailed its stand on the removal of Article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir in the campaign campaign of this Assembly election nor has ignored the issue
 party ne kaha ki vah rajya main bhrashtachar mukt or vanshavaad mukt shashan muhaiyaa karaane tathaa vikaas ke vaadon ke saath chunaav lard rahi he
 This remark was made by the BJP at a time when the opposition parties have targeted it for reducing their stand on the issue of removal of Article 370 in the campaigning for the Assembly elections

 He said, 'we have neither given up on this issue nor separated from it
 sawaal yah he ki jammu-kashmir kaa chunaav ek acha shashan muhaiyaa karaane ke liye ladaa ja rahaa he
 It is not correct to say that we left one issue and did not leave the others
 ham sabhi muddon par chunaav lard rahe hai
 The BJP spokesperson claimed that the people of the state had become upset with three families - Nehru, Abdullah and Mufti and were supporting the party in the name of Narendra Modi

 Before the upcoming MCD elections in Captain and Maken's separate Rahadilli, the Aam Aadmi Party appealed for the MCD elections to be done in ballot paper instead of evms, while Delhi Congress President Ajay Makenne also added his voice

 haalanki salmaan or ulia donon hi khud ko ek duusare ke achche dost bataate aae hai
 But there have been many occasions when Salman and Yulia's close friends have said something about their relationship
 ab haal hi ki baat karen to salmaan ne ulia ko unka ek sctch gift kiya he
 Yulianne has shared this sketch on Instagram
 sctch par ulia or salmaan donon ke phans kii ore se kai mjedaar caments bhi post kiye gaye hai
 Fans have requested Yulia to make a sketch of Bhishmaal Khan
 uliane apni post main is baat kaa saaf-saaf zikr to nahin kiya he ki yah painting unhen salmaan khan ne hi gift kii he lekin painting ke neeche salmaan ke signechar se yah saaf he ki yah painting salmaan dwaara hi banaai gai he
 There is no doubt that Salman Khan loves painting and from time to time he keeps on painting as gifts to his dear friends

 main kul 21 baras kaa tha or banisbatan yuva umr main guzar gaye apane walid kii maut kii traasadee ke baad stenford se apni degree adhuri chhodkar lautaa tha
 The initial few years at Wipro were about to get embroiled
 sab kuch nayaa tha or siikhnaa padaa
 There were many good people for my help and support, but ultimately the responsibility was mine and i felt it very strongly
 maine zyaadaatar to cells ke logon ke saath sadakon par jaakar siikhaa
 We used to go shop-to-shop and persuade the shopkeepers to keep our vegetable oil, which we used to make in those days
 isse mujhe industry ke inasaani se lekar aarthik pahaluon tak kaa antarang najariya hasil hua
 It also taught me that our organization is as good as our sales people
 ve hamaare sabase ahm log the
 i also learned how complicated sales work is
 iske liye mehnat tathaa kaabiliyat jaruri he
 This was the lesson that i saw everywhere come true
 thik 17 saal pehle jab hamane foundation kii shuruyaat kii or sarkari skulon ke saath kaam karnaa shuru kiya, tab talim ke bare main mujhe kuch ata-pataa nahin tha
 But i knew that the best way to learn is to go and spend time with the people in the front row
 is maamle main aage kii qatari ke ye log shikshak or principal the
 i have done this in these years, and in each such case i got a glimpse of how non-trivial the teacher's role and challenges are
 ise bayaan karne ke liye aaie, main aapako apane ek khaas safar kaa tajurba bataata hum
 My journey to Barmer district of Rajasthan was an unforgettable experience
 ek skool main dopaher ke khaane ke dauraan pradhan shikshak ne bajre kii roti par ghi kii kalchhi udilne par jor diya
 On his own initiative he said, "you must be wondering about this ghee
" ''or phir unhone samajhaayaa
 The school has 265 students
 mid-de mile main utana hi anaaj miltaa he jo har bachche ke aadhaar par tay kiya gaya he
 But on any given day five to 10 children are absent from school
 ve yah pakkaa karte ki sahi maatra main khaanaa pakaaya jaae or gaiyrhaazir chaatro kaa anaaj bachaa lete
 In a few weeks, they save so much that they bring some ghee and sweets from the village grocery store
 or yahi ve chaatro ko dete hai
 It is clear that for the mid-day meal, a lot of money is needed from the government in all the schools across the country to increase the nutritional content
 magar maujuuda tangadasti main jo behtareen kiya ja saktaa he, vah ye pradhan shikshak karte hai
 This was the ghee, some of which they were sharing with school guests
 pradhan shikshak kii samajhadaari kai duusari chizon main bhi jhalak rahi thi
 Among them was the Bal Mela which was hosted by his school and where he went
 is aayojan kaa makasad paas-pados ke skulon ke shikshakon main shikshan kala ke asardaar tareekon ke bare main jaagrukta paidaa karnaa tha
 For Bal Mela, it was necessary to change educational ideas into effective and interesting mechanisms to attract teachers
 ve keval hoshiyaar or maahir hi nahin balki sachche or khare tathaa thos shaikshik samaj se bhi las the
 He was led by five teachers inspired by inspiration
 nateeja vah skool tha jahaan bachche khush the or bakhubi sikh rahe the
 The community was also extremely proud of this school
 yah un pechida chunautiyon ke baavjood tha jinka saamana skool ko karnaa pad rahaa tha
 Most of the children were suffering from extreme poverty in their homes, were able to come to school somehow, five teachers were handling the work of nine, etc
 barmer jile main main teen din rahaa
 There i met more than 200 school teachers
 unki patibaddhta, lagan or eemaandaaree dil ko chhu lene vaali thi
 Especially in view of the difficult situations and compulsions they had to work
 desh bhar ke ek ke baad ek jilon main maine yahi dekha
 There is a large section of teachers who are doing amazing work with their own initiative and understanding despite various shortcomings and challenges
 aise shikshakon kaa bhi ek bada hissaa he, jo sahaayta or sahi maahaul milane par acha kaam karata he
 a small part is careless and indifferent
 yah kaarobaar yaa duusare kshetron ke bade sanghathanon se bahut alahada nahin he
 This means that out of ninety million teachers spread across the country, lakhs of teachers are honest and committed
 hamen achche paathyakram, buniyadi dhaanche or prashasan kii jarurat he
 But teachers are the real fighters on the front line of education
 or achche or patibaddh shikshak bada fark laa rahe hai, baavjood iske ki kai duusari baaten unke khilaaf jaati hai
 This is the next line that will determine the success of our education and it is education that makes our society strong
 magar pichley dashakon ke dauraan hamane shikshakon ko baqayada kam aanka he or unamem kam nivesh kiya he
 If we give such importance to our teachers, then how can education be good? If we want to improve our education, then many measures are very important for our teachers and they need to be done immediately
 
 main yahaan mahaj teen kaa zikr karuunga
 First, there is a need to complete a complete transformation of our system of educating teachers
 yahi pranali bi
 Ed
 kaaryakramon ke jariye hamaare shikshakon ko taiyaar karti he
 B
 aid
 a large number of colleges have actually become degree shops, which have no real interest in education - they must be closed
 hamen puraane jamaane ke chote bi
 Ed
 kaaryakramon se jaruri taur par nijaat paa leni chahie or asal kalpanasheel paathyakramon ke saath chaar saal ke ekikrut paathyakramon kii taraf janaa chahie
 All colleges should run well with honesty and academic rigor
 ise mumkin banane ke liye achche-khaase sarkari or paropkaaree nivesh kii jarurat hogi
 But until we invest in preparing our teachers, how can we expect that they will be equipped with the ability to perform their roles well? The current problems of school education are to a large extent our system of educating teachers Are due to a pathetic condition
 yah behad khushi or tarif kii baat he ki centre sarkaar ne in sudhaaron kii disha main pehle thos kadam uthaae hai, magar kam se kam ek dashak tak lagaataar kaam karnaa hoga tab kahin jaakar fark aa paaegaa
 Secondly, the existing ninety million teachers will have to be supported and strengthened
 iske liye shikshakon ke peshewar vikaas ke liye jaruri asardaar jamini tareekon or sadhano ko viksit karne kii jarurat hogi
 Random and inconsistent teacher training must be discontinued
 iske liye skulon ko zyada or behatar saadhan tathaa sansaadhan muhaiyaa karwaane honge
 Some states like Karnataka have started well in terms of professional development of teachers
 teesraa, hamen apni shiksha kii tamaam buraaiyon kaa thikra shikshakon ke sir par phodda band karnaa chahie
 Instead we should give them their rightful place in the society — as architects and creators of good society
 unhen takat deni hogi, un par bharosa karnaa hoga or unhen sahaara dena hoga
 For this, there is a need for a cultural revolution in our education system and in society as a whole
 hindustan kii tarakkee maanav vikaas ke tamaam kshetron main agali qatari kii kshamta or prerana se tay hogi
 We should give importance to this front row and invest in it
 abhi tak hamane yah nahin kiya he, lihaaja isamen fouran or naatakeey badlaav kii jarurat he
 There is an important and basic need for human capability and capability of the front line, which is fostered by a culture of strengthening to make our country more equitable, equitable, human and sustainable
 iske peeche hamen apni samoochee rashtriya takat jhonk deni chahie

 Both are in front of the victims of Bhopal gas tragedy standing after 34 years, whose wounds have not been put on the wounds even after so many years
 phir bhi dil main zakhm liye bhopal gas traasadee ke ye peedit aise lakhon postcard pitishan main apana dard likhte hai
 Gas tragedy took 3 people of the family of Haseena Putli, resident of Bhopal, the amount of compensation they received from the government is 25 thousand rupees
 hasina kii ummiden ab puri tarah se tut chuki hai
 Hasina says, 'brother, we have been waiting, this party will help if we have come, how many years have we been waiting
 aap ko bataaen to koi party ne hamaara saath nahin diya
 Hasina questions the system and says, "why raise our voice, who raises the voice of the poor
" do bete 10-12 saal ke the
 There was no hope
 agar hai to jabbaar bhai, mehnat kar rahe hai uski mehnat vasuul kar de paravar digaar' vahiin ibrahimpura main rahane vaaleen 62 saal kii hamida haadase ko lekar aaj bhi saham jaati hai
 His family lost 41 lives one after the gas tragedy
 khud kai bimariyon se jujh rahi hai
 She recalls, "on the midnight of December 2, 1984, i saw only death on every side to save my life
 
 Laws house
 
 
 maayka sab khaali ho gaya
 
 kisi ko bhi vot den koi dhyaan nahin detaa'
 After this, what Hamida said was not less than a slap for all parties, he said, 'it's been 34 years
 aaj tak kisi sarkaar ne kisi ghoshnaptr ke andar ek line nahin likhi taaki peediton ko tasalli ho
 
 
 So many governments are coming
 
 
 ja rahi hai sarkaar se ummid karo lekin wo kuch nahin karti naa sunati
 
 
 Talk about our employment, pension, only to take votes is to roam abroad
 ' peedita raisa kahati hai, kisi raajnneetik dal se koi ummid nahin jo mila court se
 
 chunaav se koi ummid nahin he, pehle bhi congress thi jab gas rise
 
 
 BJP snatches employment of 2200 women, says Abdul Jabbar, convener of Bhopala Gas Victim Mahila Udyog Sangathan, sending lakhs of postcards, both parties are not paying attention to congress-bjp which is very shameful
 ye poocha jaae pragna thakur se union carbide kahaan he wo disha nahin bataa paaengi hamane shivaraj chouhan ko 26000 memorondom diye wo kahaan gayi hamen maaloom nahin
 At the same time, both the bjp-congress claim that the victims have not forgotten the Bhopal gas tragedy
 peediton ke halaat ke liye wo apane nahin duusare ke zimmedaar tehraate hai
 BJP spokesperson Rahul Kothari says, 'we are constantly in touch with them, they have been working in their midst, since the Congress government has come, only the paper work is being done, the hospital which was built Bhopal Memorial is on the verge of closure
 Can't do anything worse than this
 vahiin congress pravaktaa maanak agarwal kehete hai ki bijepi kii sarkaar ne 15 saal main kuch dhyaan nahin diya isaliye is sthiti se guzarana pad rahaa he
 They say that Digvijay Singh goes to those areas, Pragya does not know what happened in any street
 aapako bataa den ki haal hi main sanyukt raashtra kii ek report main kaha gaya he ki 1984 kii bhopal gas traasadee duniya kii sabase badi audyogic durghatnaon main se ek he
 But even after 34 years, if the victims are stumbling rate by rate, then their reason is also political
 aakhir is haadase ke gunahagaar ko desh se bhagane vaale us vakt kursi par baithe the, to unhen court main bachaane vaale aaj kursi par baithe hai
 a policeman posted at the National Conference's Hazratbal office in Srinagar, the capital of Jammu and Kashmir, died under mysterious circumstances
 police ne yahaan bataaya ki head consteble nazeer ahamed ravivaar raat besudh paae gaye jiske baad unhen aspataal main bhartee karaayaa gaya
 He died in Astpal itself
 is ghatana ke silsile main ek maamla darj kar liya gaya he or police maut ke kaarnon kaa pataa lagane main juty hui he
 Ahmed was in charge of the policemen posted at the National Conference office and was a resident of Mandipur in Duru

 From Student of the Year to Badrinath Ki Dulhania, the chemistry of Varun Dhawan and Alia Bhatt has always been liked by the audience
 lekin haal hi main ek report kii maane, to varun aalia yani vaaria kii yah jodi ek saath kaam nahin karnaa chaahati
 It is not limited to just wanting
 sunne main aayaa he ki donon ne kaaphi sakhti ke saath ye faisla kar liya he, abdonon saathkaam nahin karenge
 Since the beginning of his career, Varun and Alia have done around eight films
 inamen se teen filmein donon ne ek saath kii thim
 Maybe this is why both of them want to work with the stars by keeping distance from each other
 vaise student of da year ke baad hampti sharma kii dulhaniya or badrinaath kii dulhaniya menvarun or aaliayak saath najar aae the
 All three films did well at the box office
 wo samay aisa tha jab producers kii najar in donon ko ek saath cast karne par tiki hui thi
 Many experts took him as a hit couple like shahrukh-kajol and govinda-karisma
 magar is faisle ke baad lagata he ki varun or aalia ke phens ko hi nahin, un nirmaataa-nirdeshkon ko bhi tagada jhatka lagegaa, jo unhen saath lekar film banane kaa sapana sanjo rahe the
 However, some people are also considering a causal relationship Malhotra and Alia Bhattki relationship
 in donon ne bhi kariyar kii shuruyaat usee film se kii thi
 Varun is currently preparing for the release of Judwaa-2
 is film main vah pehali baar dabl role main najar aaenge
 It stars Jacqueline Fernandez and Taapsee Pannu
 vahiin aalia meghna gulzaar kii film raji kii shooting main vyast hai
 In this film, she plays a Kashmiri spy
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ko party ne 2019 main piem pad ke chehre ke taur par aage badhaayaa to sahyogi dal hi naa-nukur karne lage
 Not only this, the tone of RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav also changed
 piem modi ke khilaaf vipaksh kaa kunba banane se pehle hi bikharata dikhne laga
 In such a situation, the Congress did not delay in retracing its steps and hinted at Mayawati or Mamata Banerjee to be the PM
 congress ke is kadam ke peeche party kii sochi-samajhi ranneeti maani ja rahi he
 Opposition parties want to fight unitedly to defeat Modi in the Lok Sabha elections to be held in 2019 next year, but there is no consensus on leadership
 vipaksh ke kshatrap jo congress ke sambhavit sahyogi dal hai, wo philhal rahul gandhi ko piem ummidavaar ke taur par sweekaar karne ko raji nahin hai
 However, after a meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC), the Congress Party has projected Nehru Gandhi as the face of the PM post for 2019
 congress pravaktaa randeep surajevaala ne kaha, 'congress kaa nirnay sateek, sapaat or spasht he
 Rahul Gandhi is our face
 ham unke netritv main janata ke bich jaaenge
 We will naturally have the same face when we are the largest party
 isamen shaq kii koi gunjaaish nahin he
 'till now, the JDS seems comfortable only after the Congress contested the elections under Rahul's leadership, the other allies are hesitant
 argedy ne ishaaron-ishaaron main rahul kii piem pad kii daavedaari par sawaal khadey karte hue kai or naam is pad ke liye oochaal die
 After the stunning Mayawati also gave a sharp message to the Congress that an alliance in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh is possible only if her party gets respectable seats
 agar is samjhaute main sammanjanak siten nahin milti hai to bhi unki party akele ladane ko puri tarah taiyaar he
 Seeing the displeasure of allies over Rahul's claim to the post of PM, the Congress has pulled back
 darasal congress kisi bhi keemat par mahagathbandhan main bikharaav nahin chaahati he
 Therefore, as a strategy, the Congress also introduced the name of Mayawati or Mamta Banerjee
 bijepi ko rokane ke liecongress mayawati yaa phir mamata banerjeeko pradhanmantri ke rup main sweekaar kar samarthan de sakati he
 But such a situation will come when the Congress will get fewer seats than expected
 congress ne iske jariye do bade netaaon ke saadhane kii ranneeti banaai he, kyonki yahi do netaa hai jo rahul ke netritv ko philhal sweekaar nahin kar sakati he
 This is the dream of these two leaders to become Prime Minister for a long time
 haalanki congress ne rahul ke chehre ko aage badhaakar desh ko sandesh de diya he
 Now after this, Mayawati and Mamta Banerjee's name has also been put forward to keep allies aloof
 sutron kii maane to congress 2004 ke loksabhaa chunaav kii tarj par 2019 kii ranbhumi main utarana chaahati he
 Congress, like 2004, is trying to get 120 to 150 seats by any means
 jabaki vahiin congress ke sahyogi dal main se kisi bhi party ko 40 se zyada siten milanaa mushkil hai
 In such a situation, the bet will ultimately be in the name of the Congress
 iske baad phir congress rahul gandhi yaa phir manmohan singh kii tarah se hi apane kisi netaa ko pradhanmantri pad ke liye naam aage badhayegi
 After the election results, satraps will have no option
 aise main congress ke saath rahanaa unki majaburi hogi
 Bangladesh beat Pakistan by seven wickets in the second ODI with opener Tamim Iqbal's century in the second consecutive match and his century partnership with wicketkeeper batsman Mushfiqur Rahim
 iske saath bangladesh ne teen maichon kii shrinkhalaa main 2-0 kii ajey badhat hasil kar lee he
 Bangladesh beat Pakistan by 79 runs in the first ODI
 Pakistan's team batting first only managed 239 runs for six wickets
 vah is score tak bhi saad naseem (naabad 77) or wahaab riyaj (40 gendon par naabad 51) ke bich saatven wicket ke liye 85 ran kii atoot saajhedaari kii badaulat pahunch paaya tha
 Tamim however dwarfed Pakistan's score
 unhone 116 gendon par 116 ran banaae jisamen 17 chauke or ek chakka shaamil he
 The left-hander, who scored 132 runs in the first match, shared a 118-run partnership for the third wicket with Mushfiqur Rahim (65), leaving Bangladesh with only 38
 1 over main teen wicket par 240 ran banaakar itihaas rachaa
 This is the first time Bangladesh has won a bilateral series from Pakistan
 usne isi maidan par khelaa gaya pehla match 79 ran se jeeta tha
 Pakistan lost their fifth consecutive bilateral series in odis
 input-bhashaa It is not a new thing for a Hollywood actress to be completely unmasked
 aisa aae din hota rahata he
 But this time the case is different
 soshal media main hollywood kii coiactress kii neude photo likaho gai hai
 Renowned celebrities like Jennifer Lawrence, Kate Upton had their pictures taken by themselves, but their intention would be to 'store' them on their phones
 unhone aisa sochaa bhi nahin hoga ki havers unke yphone main sendhamari karke unki nijee tasveeron ko duniya ke saamne beparda kar denge
 This case is a bit out of order, so it is necessary to tear it apart
 yahaan is maamle ko kuch psychological or kuch practical tareeke se dekhne kii koshish kii gai he
 What is the need to take your new photo? Man wants some thrill in his life
 ye romaanch mountenearing ho sakati he, swimming ho sakati he, car res ho sakati he, horse riding ho sakati he
 But without taking the lowest risk and it can be more exciting than some of the previously calculated tasks, securing yourself in seclusion and taking a photo of yourself
 kuch isi tarah kaa romaanch warderob malfunction main chupa hota he
 This is also done intentionally
 yah baat alag he ki iske mul main publicity paane kii laalasaa hoti he
 What is a celebrity coming into a program without undergarment? The desire to feel the same sensation that runs fast in the body, the form of which varies slightly on different occasions
 kya yah privesi main dakhal kaa maamla he?is sawaal ke alag-alag jawaab ho sakate hai
 'yes' and 'no' can have their own arguments
 par pehali najar main yah privesi main dakhal kaa maamla lagata he
 Suppose an actress gave her nude photo for the cover of a magazine, can she be forced to give the same photo for five-seven more magazines? Because of that he has already shown his body
 
 
 chaahe koi porn star hi kyon na ho, antat: yah use hi tay karnaa hota he ki use kab deh dikhaani he, kab nahin
 Everything depends on his 'generosity'
 is nazariye se dekhen, to kisi kii personal life or bedroom seen vaali photo churaana or use bina ijaajat public ke bich laana chori he, privesi main dakhal he
 One natural and most important question is, why do people look at other's nude photos? Some of the answers may be: 1
 chhipe hue ko dekhne kii chahatjo chijen jis had tak gupt hoti hai, insaan ke bheetar use dekhne kii ichha bhi utani hi teevr hoti he
 The desire to see things which are always in front of the eyes is not so deep
 duniya ke jin tribal ilaakon main mahilaayein aaj bhi apana upree bhaag khulaa rakhti hai, vahaan unke saath rahane vaale purush shaayad hi unke stanon ko ghoorte honge
 The reason is that the desire to see what is found open everyday will be emphasized
 2
 The difference between 'real life' and 'reel life' as far as the desire of celebrities to see the nude is concerned is also very clear
 jo dabi hui ichha real life main kabhi puri nahin ho sakati, uski bharpai log reel life ke jariye karne kii koshish karte hai
 The internet has made it very easy
 search ingine main koi naam tip kiya or seconds main hi manachaaha rigelt saamne hota he, chaahe real ho yaa phir photoshop se nikaali gai ho
 In such a situation, watching a new image or video also becomes a 'mode' of sexual fulfillment
 3
 Wanting something new every time, the arrival of secret things with newness creates a different kind of attraction
 har baar ek hi cheez boriyat paidaa karti he
 People who keep a nude image or video in their mobile or laptop are also looking for something new every time
 nae or puraane kaa yah fark bahut bada hota he, cricket match kii tarah
 How long and how often would anyone want to see the highlights of a match that has passed? Everyone awaits a new match
 yahi baat kamobesh porn par bhi lagu hoti he
 4
 yah lat kaa bhi maamla haizyaadaatar maamalon main porn dekhne kii shuruyaat deh ke angon ko dekhne kii utsukata ke saath hoti he, par dhire-dhire yah lat kaa rup le leti he
 This addiction repeatedly draws to the Internet and porn
 5
 The body texture of women is not such that only men watch porn
 mahilaon ko bhi isamen dilchaspee hoti he
 Actually, it is a matter related to everyone's personal interest
 baavjood iske, nari deh kii banaavat hi kuch aisi hoti he, jo purushon kii najar apni ore khinchati he
 When the body is not open, people start moving around with 'scans' within their clothes
 apni neude photo khinchvaane or phir badanaami se bhi bache rahane kii psychology kuch alag tarah kii he
 Khushwant Singh and 'nagan Chitra' The late journalist Khushwant Singh shared some information with readers in his column with the headline 'nagan Chitra'
 unhone is baat kaa khulaasa kiya tha ki unke ek mitra ke paas neude photo kaa bada sangrah he, jise unhone khud bhi dekha he
 He told that based on the experience of his friend that most of the young women in the metros of their country agreed to give their nude photos, most of them wanted that even if the photo of their organs became public, Their identity should not be revealed
 neude photo khinchvaane kii is psychology ko is ek udhaaharan se badi aasaani se samajha ja saktaa he
 As a matter of morality and immorality, in different times, the same work has been defined in the opposite way
 yahi vajah he ki neude photo kheenchna ho yaa dekhnaa, ise naitikta or aniatikta ke kisi ek ghere main baandhna aasaan nahin he
 It is very much dependent on the spectacles through which he is trying to see
 kya sara dosha nai technology kaa he?shaayad nahin, kyonki technology ko humsafar chunane yaa na chunane kaa vikalp sabake saamne khulaa hota he
 No phone forces a selfie
 darasal, takanic kii khoobiyon kaa khub istemaal karnaa or isaki haniyon se bedaag bache rahanaa mumkin nahin he
 Now what next 
 
 jenifer laurence, ket aptan, karston danst, mairi e vinsted, ariana grand jaisi abhinetriyon kii nagn tasviren saamne aane se shaayad hi koi gambhir sabak lene ko taiyaar ho
 The FBI will continue to solve the case of hacking and the world will continue on its own path

 @bjp4india@bjp4delhi— Prakash Javadekar (@prakashjavdekar)november 16, 2019centre sarkaar ne yah elaan aise samay kiya he jab agle kuch maheenon main dilli main vidhansabha ke liye chunaav hone vaale hai
 At the same time, there is a continuous tussle between the Aam Aadmi Party and the BJP on issues related to Delhi
 dilli main pradooshan kaa str lagaataar badhata ja rahaa he
 The air in Delhi is in a fatal condition
 pradooshan ko kam karne ke liye dilli sarkaar ne lagu od-evan niyam kabhartiya janata party(bijpi) ke netaa or rajyasabha sadsy vijay goyal virodh kar rahe hai
 On Thursday, Vijay Goel, who was performing on ITO with placards in his hands, said that the odd-even has become a joke, it has not reduced pollution
 vijay goyal ne kaha ki paanch saalon main jin kaarnon kii vajah se pradooshan failata he, unhen kam karne ke liye kejariwal sarkaar ne kuch bhi nahin kiya he
 Describing the odd-even scheme as a drama, Vijay Goyal said that the Delhi government is not serious about the issue of pollution
 america raashtrapati baraak obama ne syria ke asad shashan ke khilaaf simit sainya karrwai ke apane faisle kaa bachaav karte hue kaha he ki yah maamla antarrashtriya samudaay kii vishwasaneeyata kaa sawaal ban gaya he or vah ‘barbarta’ ko lekar khamosh nahin rah saktaa
 On the other hand, Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned the US and its allies about the attack on Syria
 Obama said today at a joint press conference with Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Refielt in Stockholm, "I and Prime Minister Refilte agree that this The international community cannot remain silent in view of the kind of vandalism
 agar karrwai nahin kii gai to or adhik rasinic hamalon kaa khatra bad jayega tathaa ashanka he ki duusare desh bhi rasinic hathiyaaron kaa istemaal karne lagenge
 '' unhone kaha, ‘‘meri vishwasaneeyata daanv par nahin he
 The credibility of the international community is at stake and the credibility of the US and the Congress is at stake because we just talk that international rules are important

 america kaa aarope he ki syria ke asad shashan kii ore se beete 21 agast ko kiye gaye rasinic hamale main 400 bacchon sahit kam se kam 1,429 logon kii maut ho gai
 The Syrian government has denied the use of chemical weapons

 He called on the Assad regime to present evidence about the use of chemical weapons

 antarrashtriya samudaay kii vishwasaneeyata daanv par lagi he or america tathaa congress kii vishwasaneeyata daanv par he kyonki ham sirf baaten karte hai ki antarrashtriya niyam mahatvapurn hai
 '' ek sawaal ke jawaab main unhone kaha ki rasinic hathiyaaron ke istemaal ke khilaaf lakshmana rekha unki ore se nahin khinchi gai he, balki yah khud antarrashtriya samudaay kii ore se khinchi gai he
 The US alleges that at least 1,429 people, including 400 children, were killed in a chemical attack carried out on August 21 by the Assad regime in Syria
 syrian sarkaar ne rasinic hathiyaaron ke istemaal se inkaar kiya he
 Russian President Putin said that any military action would be an 'invasion' without the permission of the United Nations
 unhone asad shashan dwaara rasinic hathiyaaron ke istemaal ke bare main saboot pesh karne kaa aahvaan kiya
 At the same time, he also said that if it is proved without any doubt that the Syrian government has used chemical weapons, then he will not shy away from supporting the UN Security Council resolution related to military action

 tippaniyan The Obama administration told US lawmakers that the US is not only at risk of losing its international allies and allies if it does not take military action against the Syrian Bashar al-assad regime over alleged chemical weapons use
 His credibility may also be discounted

 Playing reverse swing bowling is the most difficult task for any batsman
 aisi paristhiti main tosachin tendulkaror rahul dravid jaise diggaj ballebaajon ke bhi paseene chhot jate hai
 However, great batsmen find a way out
 haal hi main melbern main BMW ke ek event main sachin ne ek mjedaar kissa sunaaya ki kis tarah unhone newjiland ke bowler kris kerns kii khatarnaak reverse swing gendbaaji kaa saamana karne ke liye anokhaa nuskhaa ijad kiya tha
 When Ganguly asked to take off the shirt
 
 Sachin said, 'we were playing against New Zealand in Mohali
 kris kerns bowling kar rahe the
 Rahul Dravid was also batting with me
 ball reverse swing ho rahi thi
 Cairns beat us two or three times
 hamen samaj nahin aa rahaa tha ki kaise unka muqabla karen
 We could not see the shining side of the ball
 kai baar pich aisi hoti he ki ball kii chamakdaar said dekhnaa mushkil ho jaataa he
 To find the reverse swing, it is necessary to look at the shining and rough side of the ball
 'jab sachin ko baar-baar koshish karne ke baad bhi ball kii chamakdaar said najar nahin ai to unhone ek mjedaar tarkeeb nikaali or ise rahul dravid ko bataaya
 As Sachin, 'I told Rahul that when i am at the non-striker end, i will look at Cairns to see which is the bright side of the ball
 ball main jis taraf chamak hogi, main usee haath main bat pakaduunga
 If he swings out, i will hold the bat in the left hand and if he swings in, i will hold the bat with the right hand
 'sachin kaa yah nuskhaa kaam kar gaya or iske baad kai badhiya shot lage
 All the fielders were surprised to see this
 khud kris kerns ko yah samaj main nahin aa rahaa tha ki kuch der pehle jo ballebaaj unki gend ko pard nahin paa rahe the, ve achaanak hi aasaani se ran kaise batorne lage
 After some time, the New Zealand fielders realized that Sachin was standing at the non-striker's end and looking at the bowler, not Rahul
 yani sachin kisi tarah se apane saathi ballebaaj tak gend ke shining said ke bare main massej de rahe hai
 Sachin said, 'after that Chris Cairns dug up his rhythm
 usne cross sim se ball pakadi or gend daalane ke liye daud padaa
 He stopped near the bowling crease and told me what to do now
 kerns ko ye baat pataa nahin thi ki maine rahul se pehle hi kah diya tha ki agar mujhe pataa nahin chalaa ki ball kii chamakdaar said kidar he to main balle ko donon haath se pakadakar donon paanv ke bich main rakh luungaa
 Hearing this funny story of Sachin's career, the people present there laughed fiercely

 Not only this, even if a person has committed a crime before 18 years and is convicted when he attains majority, he cannot be kept in a reform home
 kyonki aparaadh ke samay vah naaballig tha isliye use jail kii sajaa bhi nahin hoti
 In such a situation, there is no way but to leave the culprit

 Researcher pointed to location access in iphone 11 Pro
 lokation of karne ke liye sabhi eps kaa lokation acces karnaa hoga block
 Apple is generally considered a privacy choice company
 iphone ko android smartfones ke mukaable sicyor bhi mana jaataa he or aisa he bhi
 Apple CEO Tim Cook has also been critical of Facebook from time to time due to the privacy of users
 iphone 11 Pro tab bhi yugers kii lokation trek karata he jab use nahin karnaa chahie
 This kind of news is coming
 aisa kahana he, security research Brian Kreb kaa
 Recently they have found that the iphone 11 Pro tracks the location even when you have turned the location off
 ye maamla gambhir lagata he
 If you are an iphone user or have ever used an iphone, then you will know that a small arrow icon appears at the top of the screen when the location is turned on
 iskaa matlab lokation on he
 Likewise, this arrow icon is not visible when the location is off
 haalanki settings main aapako ek ye bhi opshan miltaa he ki aap ero ikon ko hide karenckhrebsounshechurity ke research Brian Krebs ne kaha he ki unhone iphone 11 Pro kii lokation of karke rakhi thi phir bhi yphone ke duusare eps unki lokation acces kar rahe the
 However, this problem is not found in other iphones other than this model
 lokation of hone ke baavjood eps dwaara lokation acces maamle ko lekar Brian Krebs aipal saport main pahunche
 He gave information about this in the Apple Support Forum, but the response of Apple was such that it is not a mistake
 itnaa hi nahin aipal ne ye bhi kah diya he ki company ko aisa nahin lagata he ki isse yugers ke saath security ko lekar koi dikkat ho sakati he
 An Apple engineer said in the statement, 'it is expected that the location service icon appears in the status bar when the location is turned on
 ye ikon un system servicesaj ke liye dikhataa he jinaki settings main switch nahin hote hai'krebs ne apane blogapost main likhaa he, 'aipal kaa nayaa iphone 11 tab bhi yugers kii lokation maangata he jab aapane sabhi aplication or system sarvice ke liye nevar request data karke set kar rakhaa he'iphone main lokation of karne kaa aasaan tarika he, aap settings main ja kar privesi opshan se ise of kar sakate hai, lekin isse ye sunishchit nahin hota he ki ab koi bhi ap aapaki lokation acces nahin kar rahaa he
 To block location access by an app, there is an option to go to different apps and block location access there
 lekin is security research ne paaya he ki iphone 11 Pro main alag alag eps main lokation of karne ke baavjood lokation colect kiya ja rahaa he
 Earlier with ios 13 people had reported about such a problem
 philhal aipal ke ejeeniyar ke statement se bhi ye saaf nahin ho paaya he ki aisa kyon ho rahaa he
 Even if Apple does not find this mistake, but it is a problem for a user
 bijepi ne bihar kii jediu sarkaar par nae sire se hamalaa shuru kiya he
 BJP alleged that State Director General of Police Abhayanand has been removed from the post under pressure from RJD supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav
 bihar kii jediu sarkaar ne mangalvaar ko police mahanideshak ke pad se abhayanand ko hataaya tha
 BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi said that the removal of a working and honest police officer from the post without completing his term is humiliating and breaking the morale of the police
 susheel modi ne aarope lagaaya ki jab se lalu prasad or nitish kumaar main samjhauta hua he, lalu prasad kaa police or prashasnic adhikariyon ke transfar-posting main hastkshep shuru ho gaya he
 Sushil Modi alleged that police officers of a particular class are being selected and posted to posts of lesser importance
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki paanch din pehle hi varisht police adhikariyon vinay kumaar praveen vashishtha or amit kumaar ko kam mahatv vaale padon par tainaat kiya gaya
 The former Deputy Chief Minister of the state said that when there was a disturbance in Patna after the murder of Brahmeshwar Mukhiya, the then Chief Minister Nitish Kumar had said that the Director General of Police is not responsible for the incident
 us samay jo bhi karrwai hui thi vah tatkaaleen mukhyamantri ke nirdesh par hi hui thi
 He alleged that even during the bjp's Hunkar rally, police officials were ready for all the protective arrangements, but then the then Chief Minister had instructed not to give importance to this rally
 agar unhen kaam karne ke liye swatantra choda gaya hota to ve suraksha ke pukhta bandobast karne main sakasham hote
 Sushil Kumar Modi alleged that when the political leadership is weak and unstable in the state, no official can prove to be very effective
 susheel modi ne kaha ki police mahanideshak ke pad par tainaati main jab tak hastkshep hota rahegaa, police kaa manobal giregaa or aparaadh ko roka nahin ja saktaa he
 It is worth mentioning that the Bihar government on Tuesday removed Abhyanand, a 1977 batch IPS officer of the Indian Police Service, from the post of Director General of Police of the state and replaced him with PK Thakur, a 1980 batch IPS officer, as the Director General of Police

 rajasthan main gurjaron ko aarakshan dene ke liye gahalot sarkaar ne bada faisla kiya he
 After the cabinet meeting, Sports Minister Ashok Chandna announced that a proposal will come in the Rajasthan Legislative Assembly for reservation of Gujjars
 sarkaar ke mutabik prastaav paarit hone ke baad gurjaron kii maang puri ho jaaegi or iske saath hi unka andolan khatm ho jayega
 On Wednesday, a proposal can be brought once again to give 5 per cent reservation to Gurjars in the Vidhan Sabha
 yah teesri baar hoga jab rajasthan vidhansabha main gurjaron ko 5 fisadi aarakshan dene kaa prastaav pesh kiya jayega
 The resolution for reservation will be passed on behalf of the Legislative Assembly and will be sent to the Central Government to amend the constitution for reservation of five percent of Gujjars on the same lines as the Central Government has given 10 percent reservation to the poor
 aisa karke congress sarkaar gurjar aarakshan kaa gend centre kii bijepi sarkaar ke paale main daalana chaahati he
 It is believed that after the passage of this bill, the agitation for Gujjar reservation in Rajasthan may end and millions of people can get relief
 gurjar aarakshan kii vajah se jagah-jagah hajaaron log fanse hue hai
 In the last 5 days, 45 trains were affected, in which 14 trains were canceled, while millions of people have been affected
 cabinet kii meeting ke baad khel rajya mantri ashok chandana ne kaha ki gurjar jo maang rahe hai uski maang vidhansabha main paarit kar diya jayega or uske baad gurjar andolan khatm ho jayega
 There is also a compulsion for the Congress to end the agitation for Gujjar Reservation at the earliest as incidents of violence were increasing everywhere
 is bich congress ke rashtriya adhyaksh rahul gandhi 14 farvari ko ajmer main sevadal ke kaarykram main aa rahe hai or us ilaake main bhi gurjar aarakshan ko lekar andolit hai
 It is also being said that Gurjars, once angry with Sachin Pilot not becoming Chief Minister, can return to Congress once again by bringing Gujjar reservation bill
 pichley hafte gurjar samudaay ne aarakshan kii maang ko lekar ek baar apana andolan shuru kiya he or kai jagah rail patariyon ko jam kar diya he
 The agitators stopped the movement of trains on the delhi-mumbai rail route
 gurjar samudaay ke log rajasthan main naukariyon or kalejon main 5 fisadi aarakshan kii maang kar rahe hai
 Agitator leader Colonel Kirori Singh Bainsla said, "we want five percent reservation for our community in the same way as the central government has provided 10 percent reservation for economically backward people
 sarkaar kii ore se hamaari maang par koi pratikriya nahin mil rahi he
 Nobody even came to talk to us, so we were forced to take this step
 "udhar, rajasthan sarkaar kaa kahana he ki gurjar andolan khatm ho or uske numaayinde sarkaar se vaarta karen lekin aisa kuch bhi hota nahin dikh rahaa
 The Ashok Gehlot government of Rajasthan has also formed a committee of 3 ministers for talks but both sides allege that no one is moving forward for talks which is making the situation worse
 kuch din pehle asaduddin ovaisi or prakaash ambedkar ek saath ek raily main dikhe
 At a rally in Sholapur in western Maharashtra, Owaisi greeted his new ally, prompting around 25,000 workers of Ambedkar's new party to converge there

 Savindan producer Dr
 bhimrao ambedkar ke pote or vanchit bahujan aghadi (VBA) party ke pramukh prakaash ambedkar ne 6 maheene pehle ghoshnaa kii thi ki wo asaduddin ovaisi kii party ke saath gathbandhan karenge or maharashtra kii sabhi 48 siton par chunaav ladenge
 Owaisi heads the All India majlis-e-ittehadul Musimin (AIMIM), which surprisingly won 2 seats in the 2014 assembly elections in Maharashtra, while the party has its full base and influence in Hyderabad
 sholapur main prachaar abhiyaan kii shuruyaat ke ke samay asaduddin ovaisi or prakaash ambedkar ne NDTV se kaha, philhal VBA soshal ejineering kaa ek prayog bhar he
 But in the month of May, if it can contribute to form a non-bjp and non-congress government at the Center, then no one will stop us

 Apart from Solapur, 64-year-old Ambedkar is also contesting from Akola seat in Vidarbha region
 vibie khud ko maharashtra kii un jatiyon kaa pratinidhi maanati he jo peedit or haashie par hai
 Its major leaders are Dalit and Muslim, both of which constitute 25 percent of the population in the state
 maharashtra kaa jhukaav ab tak do paramparaagat morchon sharad pavaar-congress or bijepi-shivasena kii ore rahaa he
 Among these, the inclination of Muslims and Dalits has been mainly towards the Congress
 (isliye congress VBA par bijepi kii bi team hone kaa aarope lagaati he or kahati he ki ise congress ke voton ko vibhajit karne ke liye banaaya gaya he
 ) On 1 January 2018, Dalits gathered near Pune to celebrate the 200th birth anniversary of the bhima-koregaon battle were attacked by a mob of upper caste people
 bhima-koregaanv yuddh main dalit sainikon ne angrejon ke saath milakar peshwa ke khilaaf yuddh kiya tha jo brahman the, or is tarah unke jaateey atyaachaar ko samaapt kiya tha
 Prakash Ambedkar blamed hardline Hindu organizations for the violence and alleged that such organizations have the patronage of the BJP government of the state
 unhone is hinsa kaa virodh karne ke liye maharashtra band bulaayaa tha
 Prakash Ambedkar said, 'its success gave me confidence that not only Dalits, but also Muslims and a large section of Maharashtra's obcs are ready for a new political front that puts their aspirations first
 isane vanchit bahujan aghadi kii sthapana kaa maarg prashast kiya
 According to the csds-lokniti survey, in the general elections held in 2014, 56 percent of the Dalits of the state chose the bjp-shiv Sena alliance while the Congress got 33 percent Dalit support
 bhagava gathbandhan se apane samaaj ke vot waapas lene ke liye, VBA congress ke saath chunaav purv gathbandhan ke liye raji thi or party ne pashchimi maharashtra ke marathavada or vidarbha kii 12 dalit prabhutv vaali siton par daawa kiya tha
 Congress did not accept even though out of the 12 seats which Prakash Ambedkar had demanded, Congress could not win any in the last three Lok Sabha elections
 purv kendriya mantri susheel kumaar scindia jo sholapur se congress ummidavaar hai or prakaash ambedkar ke khilaaf chunaav lard rahe hai, daawa karte hai ki sharad pavaar kii party ensipi ko gathbandhan se baahar rakhane kii ambedkar kii jid se hameshaa yahi laga ki vah kabhi bhi gathbandhan karne ko lekar gambhir nahin the
 'an NCP leader publicly supported the main accused of the bhima-koregaon violence, because of which Ambedkar did not want NCP in the coalition
 scindia sholapur se 3 baar saansad rah chuke hai
 Before this election, Ambedkar came dangerously close to being politically irrelevant
 unhone pichhali baar 1999 main chunaav jeeta tha
 Then in 2016, a printing press set up by Ambedkar in Central Mumbai was demolished for the construction of a commercial complex, which led to a tremendous anger in his community which brought him huge political gains
 uske baad bhima-koregaanv hinsa hui jisane unhen daliton kaa bada netaa bana diya
 The BJP has fielded Mahaswami Siddheshwar from Sholapur, while the Lingayats are religious leaders and have long been party supporters
the bjp-shiv Sena of the state, headed by VBA devendra fadanvis ke netritv vaali rajya kii bijepi-shivasena sarkaar dwaara sarkari naukari main oonchi jati vaale maratha samudaay ke liye aarakshan or unke liye collejon ke nirmaan jaise kadamon ke khilaaf nichali jatiyon main main vyaapt gusse par bade paimaane par daanv laga rahi he
 The Dhangar community, which has 9 per cent of the population in Maharashtra, says that this is what the Fadnavis government promised in 2014 that their community would be given 7 per cent reservation by giving them Scheduled Tribe status but that was not met
 philhal dhangar samudaay ko ghumantu janajati kaa darja praapt he or use 3
 5% reservation is available
 sangli se vanchit bahujan aghadi ke ummidavaar or dhangar netaa gopichand padalkar kehete hai, 'yadi rajya kii bijepi sarkaar saamaajik or shaikshanik rup se pichde varg ke antargat oonchi jati ke maraathon ke liye 16 fisadi aarakshan ke prastaav kaa bill paas kar sakati he, yadi centre kii modi sarkaar aarthik rup se pichhadon ke liye 10 fisadi kota kaa bill paas kar sakati he, to phir dhangar samudaay kii maang ko kyon najrandaaj kar diya gaya
 But there are also many contradictions in Prakash Ambedkar's efforts to form a new social alliance
 udhaaharan ke liye, maharashtra main hindu dalit ek niyo-buddhist ko apana netaa maanane ko anicchhuk hai
 (neo-buddhist Dr
 biaar ambedkar ke anuyaayi hai, jinke netritv main 1956 main lakhon daliton ne buddha dharm sweekaar kar liya tha
 ) These two communities also vote separately, Hindu Dalits choose bjp-shiv Sena while Buddhist Dalits often vote for Congress
 VBA kii sholapur raily main sajid shaikh va apane anya doston ke saath shaamil hone aae or pehali baar vot de rahe 22 varshiya vijay guru ne kaha, 'is baar bikharaav thodaa kam he
 Since 2014, the increasing attacks against Dalits across the country, whether it is Unat of Gurat or Saharanpur in UP, have come close due to these incidents
 ' vijay ne kaha, 'asaduddin ovaisi yuva muslim matadaataaon ke bich khaase mashhoor hai
 But in the end, the community will vote for the BJP, which the people do not know, and the VBA that people do not know today, may start to know it
 'ovaisi or ambedkar kii jodi ko sthaneey media ne maharashtra kii raajnneeti main 'viru or jai' kaa naam diya he, jo 1970 ke dashak main ai bollywood kii superhit film sholay ke do kirdaar hai, jo milakar daaku gabbar singh kii dehshat ko khatm karte hai
 He told NDTV, 'this may not be our turn this time but we are ready for our next fight

 Sonia Gandhi may have become the working president of the Congress but Digvijay Singh has come into full form as soon as he returns
 upie ke shasankaal main madhya pradesh se lekar dilli tak khulkar bayaanbaji karne vaale digvijay singh ko party ke purv adhyaksh rahul gandhi ke kaarykaal main khaas tavajjo nahin mil rahi thi
 The situation was that even during the Madhya Pradesh assembly elections, he was publicly expressing his pain, 'my speech cuts Congress votes, so i don't go to rallies
 ' darasal us samay chunavi reliyon main digvijay singh nadaarad rahete the
 The absence of Digvijay Singh at rallies in Madhya Pradesh was a matter of discussion between the activist and the media
 isaki ek vajah yah bhi thi ki party ke ranneetikaron ko lagata tha ki digvijay singh ke bayaan pehle bhi acha-khaasaa nuksaan pahunchaa chuke hai isliye unase uchit duuri banaae rakhana hi thik he
 Even Digvijay Singh was not showing in the posters
 ek samay rahul gandhi ke raajnneetik 'guru' kahe jane vaale digvijay singh party main puri tarah se alag-thalag padate chale gaye
 Meanwhile, he also lost the Lok Sabha election to Pragya Singh Thakur
 lekin sonia gandhi ke kaarykaal ke dauraan digvijay singh party ke niti nirdharakon main se ek the or raajnneetik ladaai or bayaanbaji main aage rahete the
 Sonia Gandhi had full faith in him
 tabhi aisa lag rahaa he ki sonia gandhi ke haath main ek baar phir kaman aate hi digvijay singh form main aa gaye hai
 On 1 September, he once again made a statement in the familiar style that 'bajrang and BJP people are taking money from ISI
 is par thodaa dhyaan dijie
 One more thing that Pakistan's ISI is being spied by non-muslims more than Muslims
 ' maamle ko tool pakadta dekh digvijay singh ne twitor par safai bhi di, 'kuch channel chalaa rahe hai ki maine bhaajapa par yah aarope lagaaya he ki ve ISI se paisa le kar pakistan ke liye jasusi karte hai
 This is completely wrong
 bajrang dal va bhaajapa ke iti cell ke padaadhikari dwaara ISI se paise lekar pakistan ke liye jasusi karte hue mapra police ne pakadaa he
 i have alleged this, which i still hold today, why the channels do not ask these questions to the BJP '
 lekin digvijay singh ke form main aane kii sabase badi kahani us samay saamne ai jabakmalnath ke netritv vaali sarkaar ke 28 cabinet mantriyon main se ek umang singhar ne yah kahkar sabko chaunkaa diya ki parde ke piche se digvijay singh hi sarkaar ko chalaa rahe hai
 In fact, a few days ago, Digvijay Singh wrote a letter to the ministers of Madhya Pradesh in which he had asked, 'I sent letters related to the transfer of other subjects for necessary action from January to August 15, 2019
 usamen maine mere patron par kii gai karrwai karaane yaa na hone kii dasha main jaankaree dene kaa anurodh kiya tha
 i want to meet you to know about the action taken on the letters sent by me, do not bother to provide time for this
 jab unke patr par rajya ke van mantri umang singhar se patrakaron ne sawaal puche to unhone kaha ki yah purv siem digvijay singh hai jo vastav main parde ke peeche se rajya sarkaar chalaa rahe hai, 'mananeey digvijay singh ke bare main ye kahuunga sarkaar parde ke peeche se chalaa rahe hai
 This is well known to all, the people of the state know that Congress workers know that they do not need to write a letter, why do they need to write a letter when the government is running
 philhal dekhne vaali baat yah he ki digvijay singh kaa ek baar phir form main aana congress ko kitna phayda pahunchaata he yaa nuksaan

 ) jiesti bill par mukhya vipakshi party congress kaa rukh monsoon satr main naram dikhaai pad rahaa he
 The Congress has softened its main demand for keeping the cap in constitutional amendments at 18 per cent tax rate
 haalanki congress apni maang par sarkaar se tex rate par guarantee kaa aashwaasan maang rahi he
 According to sources, there was a positive conversation between Ghulam Nabi Azad with Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Anant Kumar on behalf of the government, in which he told the government his new stand in Congress, now the party is waiting for the government's reply
 piem ne virodhiyon se milakar die sanketadrasal loksabhaa shuru hone se thik pehle pradhanmantri khud jaakar saamne baithisonia gandhise mili, phir agali qatari main baithe mulaayam singh samet tamaam netaaon se mulaakaat kii
 Although it was the courtesy of PM, but its political significance is being considered
 mana ja rahaa he ki piem ne vipaksh ko saath lekar chalane kaa sanket mia he
 a look at the demands of the Congress The Congress has indicated signs of softness in its main demand on the bill
 ab tak congress jiesti bill par apni teen maangon par adi thi
 First, the constitutional amendment bill on GST should be set at 18 percent of the tax rate
 doosraa-jiesti vivaadon ke niptaare ke liye praadhikaran kaa gathan ho
 Third - Producer states to withdraw additional one percent tax
 congress kii in teen maangon kii vajah se jiesti bill kai sansad ke satron main paarit nahin ho sakaa
 The reason for the change in the attitude of the Congress is believed to be the defeat of the Congress in the recent elections and the weakening of the party politically in the Rajya Sabha
 bich kaa rasta nikalne kii asajiasti par congress ke nae rukh ke baad agle ek-do din main congress netaaon se vitt mantri arun jetali or sansadeey kaarymantri anant kumaar kaa baatcheet karnaa tay mana ja rahaa he
 On the first and main demand of the Congress, there are three options from the government, either the GST rate can be included in the supporting rules of the bill or the GST rate limit can be kept in the GST bill
 agar nahin to sarkaar koi masauda laae jisamen jiesti rate ko kanoonee suraksha di ja sake
 The government hopes that the much-awaited GST bill will be passed in the monsoon session of Parliament with the cooperation of all
 loksabhaa main congress netaa mallikarjun khadge kaa is maamle par kahana he ki do maangon par to hamaare or sarkaar ke bich kareeb-kareeb sahmati ban rahi he
 Sonia Gandhi will take the final decision, it is believed that on Wednesday, when Sonia will face her mps in the Congress Parliamentary Party, then her stance on GST can decide a lot
 jiesti ek sanvaidhanik sanshodhan bill he
 In such a situation, Rajya Sabha should remain in the order and the support of most of the people, therefore it is also important for the government to get the support of Congress on GST
 vaise donon pakshon ke taaja rukh ko dekhte hue abhi tak to is bill ke isi satr main paas hone ke positive sanket mil rahe hai
 Anurag Kashyap is an experimenter and Rebel filmmaker of this era, he has also helped many actors in the industry to travel from floor to floor
 pankaj treepathi, vineet kumaar singh, richaa chaddha, huma kuraishi se lekar navazuddin siddiki tak is list main kai sitare aise hai jinhen bollywood main sthapit hone main kashyap kahin naa kahin madadgaar rahe hai
 That is why there is a perception among many people that they give a lot of opportunity to the Strugglers, but Kashyap also has his own strategy that he repeats these actors three times in his films and after that he rarely works with them
 
 ve haal hi main apane baar main kai dilachasp sawaalon ke jawaab dete nazar aae
 Kashyap answered a question by Manoj Bajpai on the film Companion's show
 manoj unase jaananaa chaahate the ki aakhir kya kaaran he ki kashyap aksar videsh main likhane ke liye nikal jate hai? is par kashyap ne kaha ki mujhe ghoomana pasand he
 i also like long flights because i can write long enough in them
 mujhe likhte samay ekant acha lagata he or videsh main ek phayda ye he ki kisi script par likhte hue main kahin bhi aa-ja saktaa hum or mujhe kisi actor kii chintaa nahin kerani hoti jo mujhase aakar kahe ki sar mujhe role chahie

 pradhanmantri narendra modi or bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah kii jodi kii taraf se sahyogiyon ko sanket de diya gaya he ki sahyog or samarthan paane or banaae rakhane ke liye bhaajapa koi pahal nahin karegi
 Allies will have to decide for this initiative themselves
 bhaajapa mahasachiv arun singh ne india today se kaha, "modiji ke netritv main bhaajapa ko pichley loksabhaa chunaav main purna bahumat mila tha phir bhi hamane apane sahyogiyon ko mantrimandal main sthaan diya
 In 2019, the BJP will also get a big success from the last election
 aise main hamaare saath jo sahyogi hai, unke liye bhi yah safalataa hogi
 The Congress forms its alliance on the formula of taking and giving, not the BJP
 '' to bhaajapa 2019 bina sahyogiyon ke ladegi?iskaa uttar dete hue bhaajapa mahasachiv kailash vijayawargeey kehete hai, "pichley chunaav main jad (you) ne hamaara saath chhod diya tha
 We decided to fight without JD (U)
 ham lade or jite
 Later our old colleague came back with us as JD (U)
 ''tidipi ke endie chhodane or anya sahyogi dalon ke rukh main aae badlaav se bane halaat main bhaajapa kamobesh usee ranneeti par manthan kar rahi he jiske tahat nitish ke alag hone ke baad bhaajapa chali thi
 Adopting the same strategy, the party won and won the Maharashtra Assembly elections irrespective of the Shiv Sena
 bhaajapa ke ek netaa kaa kahana he ki sahyogiyon ke saath chhodie se koi bada antar padane vaala nahin he
 In such a situation, the BJP should show itself to be cautious about leaving the allies, this is a well thought out strategy
 isliye bhaajapa, algepi, shivasena, suheldev bhartiya samaaj party kii taraf se pratyaksh or paroksh rup se mil rahi dhamkee kii parvaah nahin kar rahi
 Sources say that the party has decided that it is a better option than bowing to increase or maintain the alliance, to fight on its own
 agar 2019 aate-aate bhaajapa banaam anya kii sthiti banati he to bhaajapa ise apane liye mufeed maanati he
 However, allies are calling this stance of BJP fatal
 tidipi netaa thota narsinhan kaa kahana he ki ghatak dal kisi bhi gathbandhan ke liye mahatvapurn hote hai
 In areas where BJP has a presence, the party gets the votes of its allies
 jaise andhra pradesh, bihar yaa tamilnadu
 Keeping this in mind in the last election, the BJP also tied up with those parties which were not in a position to win any seat
 abhi bhi endie main do darjan aise dal hai jinke paas apni koi seat nahin he
 An LJP leader believes that JD (U) and BJP are strong in Bihar
 lekin ve yah bhi kehete hai ki agar in donon ke saamne baaki dal ek ho jaaen to bhaajapa ke liye mushkil ho jaaegi
 At the moment, in the midst of the changed political equation, the BJP has moved ahead with the image of Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 bhale koi gathbandhan chhodkar chalaa jaae
 To show an aggressive attitude to the allies, the BJP made a statement on behalf of Home Minister Rajnath Singh in the Lok Sabha after the no confidence motion from the TDP that the government is ready to discuss the no confidence motion
 tidipi se pehle viesar congress ne bhi avishvaas prastaav kaa notice diya tha lekin sarkaar ne apana rukh tab jaahir kiya jab tidipi ne bhi avishvaas prastaav kaa notice loksabhaa sachivalay ko diya
 The BJP is currently exerting its full force on strengthening the party in the states where the allies are together
 tidipi ke chhitakate hi bhaajapa ne apane kaddavar mahasachiv ram madhav ko andhra pradesh main sakriy kar diya he
 He has been asked to work on the blue print through which bjp's penetration in the backward classes was increased
 sutron kaa kahana he ki isi formule ke tahat bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah ne uttar pradesh kaa prabharee rahete hue pichhadon or gaiyr-jatav daliton main bhaajapa kii paith banaai thi
 Both bjp's old allies Ram Vilas Paswan and Upendra Kushwaha from Bihar have been uneasy ever since Nitish Kumar has joined the BJP
 sutron kaa kahana he ki in donon netaaon ko sandesh de diya gaya he ki siton ke bantwaare ko lekar bhi bhaajapa kisi tarah kaa dabaav lene ko taiyaar nahin he
 It is not necessary that these parties get as many seats as were given in the last election
 maharashtra main chunki shivasena pehle hi yah prastaav paarit kar chuki he ki 2019 ke loksabhaa or vidhansabha chunaav akele ladegi, isliye vahaan seat bantwaaraa charchaa kaa vishay nahin he
 BJP leaders say that if the Shiv Sena wants to fight it is welcome, but the BJP will not accept any demand for seats
 ahm baat yah he ki sahyogiyon se beparwaah bhaajapa apane puraane saathiyon ko bhi tavajjo dene ko taiyaar nahin he
 In Punjab, the Akali Dal is constantly under pressure from the BJP to give seven seats to the BJP in 2019
 abhi tak bhaajapa yahaan 3 or akali 10 siton par chunaav ladate aae hai
 To increase this pressure, the BJP is conducting a pole-open campaign against the Congress government alone in Punjab
 akali dal isi tarah kaa alag kaarykram chalaa rahaa he
 Despite being part of the NDA, the two are not together
 bhaajapa mahasachiv vijayawargeey kehete hai, "bhaajapa kaa prabhaav desh bhar main he
 Where we have less influence, we are strengthening ourselves
 kuch saal pehle tak bihar main yaa maharashtra main ham junior partner hua karte the lekin modiji ke netritv main bhaajapa in rajyon main sabase badi party he
 Understanding this practical mathematics is essential for any political party
 sabase badi party hote hue bhi bhaajapa is ganit ko samajhati he
 '' *** uttar pradesh main chunaav kii taiyaariyaan joro par chal rahi he

 In the Lok Sabha elections 2019, the Trinamool Congress has placed its bets on its sitting MP Vijay Chandra Burman who is facing a challenge from Bhagirath Chandra Roy of the Marxist Communist Party

 iske alaava bahujan samaaj party, socialist unity centre of india (communist), amara bengali, samaajawaadee jan parishad, kamatapur pipuls party (united) ke saath teen nirdaleey ummidavaar bhi maidan main hai
 Let us know that the three seats of West Bengal are to be voted in the second phase on 18 April

 In the second phase of Lok Sabha elections 2019, 97 Lok Sabha seats in 13 states are to be voted
 matdaan kaa parinaam 23 may ko aana he
 Jalpaiguri is a district of West Bengal rich in historical and natural beauty
 yah rajya ke uttar main sthit he or uttar bengal kaa doosraa sabase bada shahar he
 This district is important because it connects the rest of the states of the country to Northeast India
 bhugolic najariye se dekha jaae to yah pashchim bengal kaa ek shandaar sthal he, jahaan prakruti ne apana khajaana dil khol kar lutaaya he
 The Trinamool first contested the CPI-M seat of the Jalpaiguri Lok Sabha seat in 1962
 abhi is seat kaa pratinidhitiv trinmul congress ke vijay chandra burman kar rahe hai
 This seat has been mostly occupied by the Marxist Communist Party (CPI-M) after the Emergency in the country, but in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Vijay Chandra Burman of the Trinamool Congress managed to win from here
 burman ne 494,773 matlab 38
 Won with 00 per cent votes, while cpi's Mahendra Kumar Roy, who had held this seat since 1980, had to face defeat
 roy ko 425,167 yani 32
 65 percent votes were received
 laharaata rahaa he laal jhandajalpaigudi sansadeey seat teesri loksabhaa ke liye hue chunaav ke samay astitv main ai thi
 During that time, Jawaharlal Nehru had an aura in the public and politics of the country as well as the Congress
 iskaa asar vam rujhaan vaale pashchim bengal main dikhataa rahaa he, or jalpaigudi sansadeey seat par 1992, 1967 or 1971 main hue aam chunaavon main congress apana jhanda fahraati rahi
 But after the Emergency, the picture of the Jalpaiguri seat changed with the country and in the 1977 elections, independent candidate Khagendra Nath Dasgupta won from here
 iske baad 1980 main is seat par makapa ke subodh sen jeet kar sansad pahunche
 In 1984, 1989, Manik Sanyal of CPI-M reached Delhi by winning parliamentary elections twice in a row
 unke baad makapa ke hi tikat par 1991 or 1996 ke chunaavon main jitendranath das jitate rahe
 cpi's Minati Sen was consistently elected in the 1998, 1999 and 2004 elections
 2009 ke aam chunaav main makapa ne apana ummidavaar badla or mahendra kumaar roy chunaav jite
 Whereas in the 2014 elections, Vijay Chandra Burman of Trinamool Congress elected from here and reached Parliament
 saamaajik prishtabhumijalpaigudi jile kii takreeban 80 fisadi aabaadi main daliton or adivaasiyon kii hissedari he
 This is the reason that out of the seven assembly seats in Jalpaiguri, six are reserved for scheduled castes and tribes
 parisemen ayog kii 2009 kii parisemen report main jalpaigudi loksabhaa seat ko saat vidhansabha kshetron main vibhajit kiya gaya
 Of these, five are reserved for Mekaliganj, Dhupguri, Menaguri, Jalpaiguri and Rajganj Scheduled Castes and one assembly seat for Maal Scheduled Tribe
