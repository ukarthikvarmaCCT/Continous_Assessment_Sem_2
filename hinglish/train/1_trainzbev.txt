 75 fisadi kar diya
 This has increased the expectations of people to reduce EMI in loans
 lekin pichley varshon ke trend ko dekhen to is maamle main zyada khush hone kii vajah nahin banati
 While the Reserve Bank is being cut on interest rate cuts, banks are not giving full benefit to the customers
 repo rate main katautee kaa phayda graahakon tak na pahunchaa kar bainkon ne pichley paanch saal main gharelu arthvyavastha kaa ek tarah se dam ghont rakhaa he
 The industry has also been reluctant to expand new projects or old plants due to persistently high interest rates
 siemii ke anusaar, desh main nijee nivesh 14 saal ke nichle str par pahunch gaya he
 Higher interest rates are also directly impacting the consumption of automobiles, consumer durables and FMGC products
 isaki vajah se desh main khapat kaa ingine thap padaa he
 In January 2014, the Reserve Bank cut the repo rate by reversing the rise in interest rates
 iske baad se rigerv bank 10 baar repo rate main katautee kar chukaa he or isamen kul milakar 2
 There has been a reduction of 25 percent
 2014 ke 8 fisadi se repo rate ghatakar ab 5
 75% has been reached
 duusari taraf, desh ke sabase bade bank bhartiya state bank ne is bich apane karj kii byaaj dar main sirf 0
 6 per cent reduction and this is 10
 15 fisadi se ghatakar 9
 Has reached 55 percent
 is tarah kii nafarmani abhootpurv he
 But the Finance Ministry and the Reserve Bank seem to be silent on this
 bainkon kaa tark rahata he ki repo rate katautee kaa phayda graahakon or udyog tak pahunchane ke pehle unhen oonche byaaj dar vaale jamaa yojanaon kaa samaayojan karnaa he
 But they have got 5 years to adjust their loan portfolio
 iske liye ab koi bahaanaa nahin bachataa he
 Significantly, in the monetary policy review meeting of RBI on Thursday, the repo rate is 0
 25 fisadi kii katautee hui he
 Apart from this, the Reserve Bank has also given big relief by cutting the charges levied on its behalf in money transfer facility like NEFT
 rigerv bank ne atm nikasi par lagane vaale fees kii bhi samiksha karne kaa bhi nirnay liya he

 Air travel across the country remains a problem today as around 800 pilots of Air India are on strike

 For the air travelers, this is the morning of the disaster

 Around 800 Air India pilots have gone on strike since midnight
 jaahir he aise main sankat vimaan ke udne kaa hota he
 The strike will have the greatest impact on domestic flights as all the pilots belong to Indian Airlines
 payalton ne vetan vruddhi kii maang main ye hadtaal kii he
 The Indian Commercial Pilots Association (ICPA), which announced the strike, alleges that Indian Airlines and Air India pilots are discriminated against in pay and allowances
 unki maang he ki indian airlines ke payalton ke liye air india jaise vetan bhatte or kaam ke ghante nirdhaarit hon
 Negotiations with the Chief Labor Commissioner and Air India Management over the demand of the pilots before the strike failed for several weeks
 hadtaal kaa notice to 23 farvari ko hi diya gaya tha
 But due to negotiations, the strike due to extension of deadline and then the Delhi High Court was stopped from 16 March

 However, Union Aviation Minister Vayalar Ravi has formed a committee of three members in this matter

 management cote ke payalton kii sevaayen lekar is baat kii koshish kii ja rahi he ki vyapak paimaane par vimaan sevaaon main koi dikkat naa ho
 But to overcome the shortage of about 800 pilots is probably not going to be such an easy task

 madhya pradesh ke badnaam vyavsaayik pariksha mandal (vyapam) ghotaale main is saal june or july main achaanak ai mauton kii baadh ke baad puure desh main hallaa machaa
 Subsequently, in July, the Supreme Court handed over the investigation to the CBI
 lekin jaanch apane haath main lene ke baad se sibiai ab tak koi giraftaar nahin kar saki he
 The CBI has registered firs in more than 1,000 cases against the same people, on which Madhya Pradesh STF had already registered firs
 duusari taraf vyapam se puri tarah hataa di gai, madhya pradesh police ke maamle main dakhlandaji karne ke sanket milane lage hai
 The efforts made by the government to declare themselves as clean and clean have started opening up
 agar sibiai kii ab tak karrwai par najar daalen to sarvocch jaanch agency ke 170 adhikari bhopal main deraa daale hue hai
 Considering the prevalence of the case, preparations are being made to form a "special Branch for Vyapam Scam" for investigation
 professors colony main do bangalon ko jaanch dal kaa asthaayee karyaalay bana diya gaya he
 But with the investigation, CBI officials also have to struggle for stay
 zyaadaatar afasar abhi guest house yaa circuit house main tehre hai
 As far as the investigation is concerned, the Madhya Pradesh STF has already handed over all the cases to the CBI and the role of the STF has now ended in this case
 sibiai ko estf ne 150 se zyada maamle transfar kiye hai
 CBI also raided the country twice to say, but no concrete information has come out yet
 isiilie congress mahasachiv digvijay singh ke vakil kapil sibbal ne aktubar main supreme court main yah maamla uthaate hue kaha tha ki ab tak koi giraftaar nahin hui he or jameen par kuch bhi hota najar nahin aa rahaa he
 But amid the scathing CBI investigation, the Madhya Pradesh Police is again accused of saving the people of the ruling BJP and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh
 taaja maamle main gwalior police ne bina kisi shikaayat ke hi aresas se sambandhon ko lekar visal blower ashish kumaar chaturvedi ko poochtacha ke liye bulaayaa
 Chaturvedi is not only the whistle blower and key witness in the case, but is also one of the petitioners in the Supreme Court against the Vyapam scam
 8 disambar ko chaturvedi ko ek patr mila jisamen gwalior ke atirikt police adheekshak virendra jain ne unase karyaalay aakar apana bayaan darj karaane ko kaha
 The letter said that Chaturvedi had made some statements about the RSS, which were printed in a newspaper
 chaturvedi police ko aakar bataaen ki aresas ko lekar kya maamla he? gauratlab he ki 2013 main vyapam ghotaale ke surkhiyon main aane ke baad aresas ke kai sheersh netaaon ke naam bhi uchle the
 Former Madhya Pradesh Higher Education Minister Laxmikant Sharma jailed in connection with the scam and Sudhir Sharma, the main accused in the case, have also been close to the RSS
 vaise,2013 main apana paksh spasht karne ke liye sangh pramukh mohan bhagwat ne ghotaale se kisi bhi aresas netaa kaa naam jude hone ke andeshe ko khaarij kar diya tha
 In the latest case, this year, on 23 October this year, as a volunteer, Chaturvedi started taking steps in the path of rss's Vijayadashami program with a khaki necker, white shirt and long sticks
 isse aresas ke liye asahaj sthiti paidaa ho gai
 Chaturvedi claims that after this incident, RSS people instructed him to stay away from Sangh activities
 chaturvedi kaa yahi bayaan media main aane ke baad police jaanch main jute gai
 Advocating the police, Gwalior ASP Virender Jain told India Today, "clippings of news reports published in newspapers are sent to police headquarters to the concerned officers according to preference
 yah ek routine prakriya he
 The clipping of news of Chaturvedi's statement about the union was also received by my office
 isamen unka paksh jaanane ke liye unhen bulaayaa gaya tha
 "but Chaturvedi says that the police is not handing over the case to the CBI to save the RSS leaders
" maine police se maamle main dakhal na dene or aresas kii bhoomika kii jaanch sibiai se karaane kii maang kii he
 Like many liars in "vyapam Ka Sach", Dr
 Anand Rai of Indore is a whistleblower of the Vyapam scam as well as a volunteer of the Sangh
 peshey se doctor raay sangh se judi sanstha aarogy bharti ke indore vibhaag ke upaadhyaksh hai
 However, after disclosing the scam, he too is not being invited to any Sangh program
 raay isse pehle khud mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan par hi dabaav banane kaa aarope laga chuke hai
 Apart from this, he also described the transfer of his wife Gauri Rai as a manipulation of pressure
 baad main madhya pradesh hycourt ke aadesh par pati-patni ko ek hi jagah tainaat kiya gaya
 Not only this, after the CBI investigation started, the Madhya Pradesh BJP distributed a booklet named "vyapam Ka Sach"
 lekin aadhikarik taur par na to bijepi or na hi madhya pradesh sarkaar isaki prakaashak bani
 Vyapam's Whistle Blowers made serious allegations in this booklet
 isamen dow anand raay par bhi kai aapraadhik maamle hone kaa zikr kiya gaya tha
 One of these cases is also referred to 211 / 2007, Section 323, Section 504 in Police Station Palasia of Indore
 lekin raay ne jab artiai se iskaa byoraa hasil kiya to pataa chalaa ki yah cese anand raay putr surya prakaash raay naam ke kisi duusare vyakti kaa he
 Rai is also gathering evidence about other allegations
 is tarah kii harkaton par raay kehete hai ki maamla sibiai ko saunpane ke baad bhi madhya pradesh sarkaar ke log dabaav banane ke duusare hatkande apnaane se baj nahin aa rahe
 Yes, the difference is that earlier there was direct pressure, whereas now its tendency has become indirect
 saare ghatnakram par sakht tippanee karte hue congress mahasachiv digvijay singh kehete hai, “chaturvedi or raay sangh kaaryakarta hai
 Both were silenced when they sought cooperation from the Sangh in lifting the Vyapam scam
 uske baad maine inaki madad kerani shuru kii
 "singh believes that by interrogating Chaturvedi, the Madhya Pradesh Police has interfered in the investigation and will take legal action in this regard
" udhar, sibiai ke paas maamla pahunchane ke baavjood jaanch jis dhimi gati se chal rahi he, aane vaale dinon main vah bhi raajnneetik eendhan kaa kaam karegi
 The cbi's work can be understood from the fact that the reward was declared on Vyapam's accused BJP leader Gulab Singh Kirar, but the CBI took so long to arrest him that he was able to get anticipatory bail in advance
 haalanki party ne unhen philhal nilambit kar rakhaa he
 CBI has not been able to get anything new from the people in jail
 isse nyaay kii lau maddham padati najar aa rahi he
 According to CBI sources, the investigation of the scam may take about five years
 udhar jaanch shuru hone ke baad se do pramukh sibiai afasaron ne jaanch se hatane kii arji de di he
 If the CBI does not make some big revelations soon and the police continues to do the "routine", then questions will arise
 'phek news' par soochna evam prasaaran mantralay kii taraf se jari kii gai press release bhale hi pradhanmantri narendra modi ke aadesh ke baad waapas ho gai ho lekin abhi bhi chintaaen barkaraar hai

 patrias ne kaha ki in jhatkon ke baad se pakistan ke janajaatiy ilaakon main alqaida saham gaya he
 He said that now the core group of the organization is trying to save their lives instead of making attack plans against western countries and members of the middle-level Al Qaeda can seek safe places outside Afghanistan or South Asia
 patrias ne kaha ki isse alqaida ko pakistan ke janajaatiy ilaakon se naye logon ko aakarshith kar jehadi banane main kathinaayee aegi
 But Patrias warned that al-qaeda and its associated organizations could still pose a threat, which they considered its main goal

" unke footwork main jo pravaah dekhne ko miltaa tha vah puri tarah se gaayab he or unhen ise phir se hasil karne ke liye kadi mehnat kerani hogi

 The journey of Raghuvar Das's life has been extraordinary
 tata steel main avkaash par chal rahe shramik kii maamuli prishthbhumi se oonchi chalaang lagaakar aaj ve jharkhand ke mukhyamantri kii kursi par virajman hai
 When the journey is so spectacular, then there must have been some luck in it
 das ke maamle main haalanki dusron kii badakismati kaa bhi utana hi haath rahaa he
 It is a pleasant irony that all the successes of Das's career have included the failures of another
 raghuvar ne apana pehla vidhansabha chunaav 1995 main isiilie ladaa tha kyonki bijepi ne tab jamshedpur purv seat se vidhayak deenanath pandeya ko tikat dene se inkaar kar diya tha
 It was Pandey for whom Raghuvar campaigned in 1990
 tikat katane se naaraaz pandeya ne baghawat kaa jhanda uthaa liya or nirdaleey chunaav ladakar tisare number par aae
 Whereas Raghuvar was elected as MLA with a slight margin of 1,101 votes as a BJP candidate
 barason baad ab disambar 2014 main bhi aisa hi hua
 59-year-old Raghuvar Das emerged as a challenge leader of the BJP Legislative Party because BJP leader Arjun Munda, a three-time chief minister, lost the election to Kharsawan in a surprising manner
 agar munda nahin haarate, to raghuvar kii raah utani aasaan nahin hoti
 Raghuvar became the first non-tribal Chief Minister of Jharkhand with the oath taking on 28 December
 jabaki isse pehle mukhyamantri kii kursi ko nau baar sushobhit karne vaale paanchon shaks-babulal marandi, shibu sorain, arjuna munda, madhu kodaa or hemanth sorain-adivasee samudaay se rahe hai
 But after Munda's defeat, the BJP did not have any strong tribal
 vaise 2014 se pehle raghuvar hameshaa nepathy main hi rahe
 In the BJP, Marandi was first followed by Munda
 jab sari nazren munda par hoti thim, tab raghuvar nepathy main dhairya ke saath maukey kaa intjaar kar rahe hote the
 One such occasion came after the assembly elections in December 2009, when Raghuvar got his first major success and was elected the leader of the BJP Legislature Party
 haalanki itnaa bada sapana dekhne kii keemat bhi unhen chukaani padi, jab virodhiyon ne unhen saadhe chaar saal ke liye rajnatik biabaan main dhakel diya
 In the 2009 assembly elections, both BJP and JMM got 18–18 seats
 bijepi antat shibu sorain ke netritv vaale gathbandhan kaa samarthan karne ko raji ho gai
 Raghuvar was made the leader of the BJP Legislature Party and was sworn in as the Deputy Chief Minister
 haalanki raghuvar ne apni kaaryastylee se acchhee chhap chodi, lekin is pad par ve paanch maheenon se zyada nahin rah paae
 In May 2010, the BJP withdrew its support from the jmm-led coalition government, as Shibu Soren, who had not given up membership of Parliament yet, went against the hike in petrol prices in the "mistakenly" budget in the Lok Sabha
 Had voted against the deduction proposal
 lekin teen maheenon ke bheetar hi bijepi ke tatkaaleen party adhyaksh nitin gadakari ne arjuna munda ke kehane par jeemem se koi bhi sambandh nahin rakhane kii niti ko palat diya
 Therefore, in September 2010, another coalition government with the support of JMM took power and this time was shaved by its leadership
 tab bijepi vidhayak dal ke netaa raghuvar das ko munda ke haq main pad chhodia padaa
 Not only this, Das, who was the Deputy Chief Minister of the state till just three months ago, was not even made a minister in the new government
 aisa bhi nahin ki is bich raghuvar ne netritv ke liye apana daawa thokane kii koshish nahin kii yaa bagawati tevar nahin dikhaae, lekin unki koi bhi koshish diwaar main sir maarane se zyada rang na laa saki
 In October 2010, when Munda expanded his cabinet, Raghuvar did not attend the ceremony
 yahaan tak ki apni naaraazgi kaa izhaar karne ke liye unhone rajya bijepi pramukh kaa pad bhi chhod diya
 But the central leadership accepted his resignation and made Munda's confidant Dineshanand Goswami the head of the state party
 isi tarah aktubar 2011 main jab bijepi ke sheersh netaa laalkrishna adwani apni janchetana raily lekar ranchi aae, tab das ko party main darkinar hue ek saal se zyada ho chukaa tha
 Raghuvar thought that this is the perfect opportunity
 unhone ek sthaneey akhbaar kii prati adwani ko bhent kii, jisamen rajya sarkaar ke bijli sanyantron main koyale or tel kii barbaadi kaa khulaasa karti ek report pehle panne par chhapi hui thi
 The power department was still with Chief Minister Munda and it was clear who was on Das's target
 lekin yah daanv bhi ulataa padaa
 Then Raghuvar lived in political exile for four and a half years from May 2010
 apane vajood ke pehle 14 saalon main nau sarkarein dekhne vaale rajya main itnaa lanbaa daur yugon ke baraabar mana ja saktaa he
 During this period, no one took care of him on the organization front
 2004-05 or 2009-10 main bijepi ke rajya adhyaksh rah chuke das ko apana siyaasi vajood kaayam rakhane ke liye bhi jujhna padaa
 Raghuvar kept facing everything in the hope of pacifying the opponents and saving his political career
 unhone apni jameen nahin chodi or sanghathan main bane rahe
 He was finally noticed when the BJP won 12 of the 14 seats in Jharkhand in the Lok Sabha elections
 halaat agast main hi behatar hote dikhaai dene lage the
 Then Raghuvar was promoted to the party's national vice president in Amit Shah's team
 isi ke saath ve mukhyamantri kii kursi ke daavedaaron kii awwal jamaat main aa gaye
 With the assembly elections approaching, many people in Delhi felt that the BJP needed a new face in the state and Raghuvar started to emerge strong at exactly this point
 vidhansabha chunaav kii taiyaari ke silsile main das ne party ke sanghathanaatmak aadhaar ko majboot banane main koi kasar nahin chodi
 Raghuvar, who was elected MLA for five consecutive terms, never lost an election
 unka yah chunavi record bhi unhen duusare netaaon se kai darje upar sthapit karata he
 The slave was probably helped most by controlling his furiousness and being moderate
 pehle unhone apni naaraazgi or virodh kaa izhaar kiya tha, lekin kabhi apni rajnatik seemaa nahin langhi
 Munda spared no effort in bypassing him in Jharkhand politics, but Das never publicly uttered a word against him
 isi disambar main jab munda chunaav haar gaye, tab bhi ve chaay pine unke ghar gaye
 But etiquette does not mean that Raghuvar does not know his politics
 28 disambar ko jharkhand ke 10wein mukhyamantri ke rup main shapath lete hue unhone apane saath teen cabinet mantriyon main nilkanth munda ko bhi shapath dilwaai
 In October 2010, while expanding his cabinet, Arjun Munda ignored only two BJP leaders
 raghuvar das ke alaava ve duusare netaa nilkanth the
 Although Das is the first chief minister to take power with a clear majority, he began to act as if he wanted to finish the job quickly
 shapath lene ke fouran baad unhone jhaadu uthaai or pradhanmantri narendra modi ke swatchta abhiyaan main apana yogadan dene ke liye ranchi kii ek slam basti main pahunch gaye
 On the very first day of his tenure, he started whipping
 unhone kanoon or vyavastha ko fouran chust-durust karne kii taakid kii or garibon ko kambal baantne ke kaam kii nijee taur par khud nigaraanee kii
 He banned the siren of his convoy, and described himself as a "slave" of Jharkhand who is ready to face challenges
 sardiyon kii shuruyaat or subjiyon ke girte daam graahakon ke liye to raahat kii baat hai, lekin ek taraf notebandi or duusari taraf is sijan main subjiyon ke girte daamon kii vajah se kisaanon or mandi vikritaon par dohari maar padi he
 Because of this, sellers are finding it difficult to recover their costs
 aadhe hue subjiyon ke dampichley ek maheene main hisubjiyon ke damadhe gir gaye hai
 According to the sellers, the yield of vegetables is good this season, but this time due to note closure people are buying in limited quantity
 isiilie zyaadaatar subjiyan bekaar ho jaati hai
 Due to the fear of being useless, vegetables have become very cheap in the market
 gaajar kii keemat 30 rupee se girakar 15 prati kilo, shimla mirch 50 se girakar 30 rupee prati kilo, phulgobhi 40 se girakar 15 rupee prati kilo, tamaato 40 se girakar 10 rupee prati kilo, matar 40 rupee se 20 rupee prati kilo or methi patta 40 rupee se 10 rupee prati kilo tak pahunch gaye hai
 If the lack of cash has an impact on the market, if you talk about the retail market, here too, sellers say that due to lack of cash, more goods cannot come from the market and the cost of transportation is same
 isiilie laagat nikaalane ke liesubjiyanmhangi bechni padati hai
 In the retail market, peas are being sold for Rs 30 per kg, onion Rs 25 per kg, tomato Rs 30 per kg, capsicum Rs 40 per kg and fenugreek Rs 20 per kg
 cashles vyapaar samaj se pareiskaa matlab he ki har sabji vikreta mandi bhav se 10 se 20 rupee mahangi bechney ko majaboor hai or graahak kharidne ko majaboor hai
 Overall sellers want to make cashless payments, but cashless trade in the large wholesale market is still beyond the comprehension of traders and farmers, and hence the cash is being purchased in the vegetable market itself
 punjab main vidhansabha chunaav ko ab sirf ek haftaa baaki bachaa he
 In the last phase of campaigning, Aam Aadmi Party is going to focus on the VIP seats of the state
 patiala main road sho27 janvari ko arvind kejariwal patiala kii sabhi vidhansabha siton par road sho karenge

 Lalu said in his familiar style that since we left the post of Railway Minister, no one is able to stand there and the Ministry has been derailed
 lalu ne kaha ki jab ve rail mantri the to rail bhawan main vishwakarma or krishna bhagwaan kii murti rakhte the or unase kah rakhaa tha ki rail kii dekhbhaal kii jimmedaari aap par he
 However, Lalu said that if he is made railway minister now, he will not accept this post but after leaving his railway minister post, the rail engine is not able to accept anyone for the said post

 unhone daawa kiya ki yadi yediurppa ko bijepi ne nikaala nahin hota karnataka main hue vidhansabha chunaav main uski sthiti itani buree nahin hoti
 Taking a dig at Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi, Lalu said that Gujarat had already been a developed state

 Lalu, dismissing Nitish's Bihar model, said that if the components of Bharat Nirman were separated, what did Bihar do on its own during the NDA rule
 lalu ne daawa kiya ki aagaamee 15 may ko rajd dwaara patna main yojit raily mukhyamantri nitish kumaar kii vidaai or aresas ke rajg ke jariye dilli kii gaddi par baithne ke sapane ko puraa nahin hone kii disha main nirnaayak hogi

 RJD supremo Lalu Prasad has accused Nitish of making a poor statement about his son and said that he should tell what the status of his son is, what he is doing
 unhone kaha, ‘chaahe unka putr ho yaa party ke anya netaaon ke putr, putree evam patni laalaten nahin uthaaenge to kya unka tir (jadyu kaa chunaav) or bhaajapa kaa camel haath main thamenge
 Regarding JDU spokespersons, Lalu accused them of being cowardly for fear of being ousted from power, saying that this rjd's Parivartan rally would pour water on the fire in their homes

 The debate over the bcci's historic decision about reformist steps in the BCCI does not appear to be over after a month as some experts have termed it as 'directly unconstitutional' while others believe that the basis of this law is because Public interest and public money are attached to it
 bisisiai ne supreme court ke faisle par salaah dene or apana paksh rakhane ke liye sheersh adaalat ke purv justise markandeya katju ko chunaa he jinhone kathith taur par is faisle ko ‘asanvaidhanik’ qaraar diya he
 However, former Chief Justice RM Lodha, head of the panel of recommending judges, reacted to this and said that the Supreme Court's decision on the dispute is final
 unhen jane maane samvidhan visheshgy govind goyal kaa bhi samarthan kiya jinhone kaha ki supreme court ko board ke maamalon ko dekhne ko purna adhikaar he kyonki janata kii ruchi or paisa isamen jude hai
 'the decision should not have been left to the Lodha Committee' Goyal, however, has only apprehension that the matter should not have been left to the Lodha Committee after the verdict and the court should have asked the government to take the Games forward
 They should connect their agencies with this matter by taking the services of experts of
 ‘asanvaidhanik faisla’goyal ne saath hi supreme court ke faisle par bisisiai ko ‘salaah dene or uske maargdarshan’ ke liye justise katju dwaara chaar sadasyeey samiti ke pramukh kii peshkash sweekaar karne par bhi ashanka jataate hue kaha ki anuchhed 124 (7) supreme court ke purv nyaayadhishon ko bharat main kisi bhi adaalat yaa adhikaran ke samaksh paksh rakhane se roktaa he
 The BCCI, which sought a review of the verdict, however got the support of senior advocate Anoop George Chaudhary, who directly declared the verdict unconstitutional
 choudhary ne faisle par pratikriya dete hue kaha ki yah faisla purv kii sanvaidhanik peeth ke faislon ko sandarbh main rakhte hue nahin diya gaya he jo do nyaayadhishon kii peeth ke liye badhyakaari tha

 This is the first time the Central Paramilitary Force has appointed a brand ambassador
 kohli ne 2011 main west indies ke khilaaf test shrunkhlaa main padaarpan test khelaa tha or yah 25-varshiya ballebaaj tab se acha pradarshan kar rahaa he
 He also played a key role in India's World Cup victory in 2011

 To avoid the recession, do not buy expensive low-income gadgets, you must constantly invest a fixed amount in the right place
 The country's economy is currently going through a critical phase
 kaarobaar ghatata ja rahaa he, berogari badhati ja rahi he
 Such a situation comes when people do not have money
 desh ke kai sector main kaarobaari growth do dashak ke nichle str par he
 Till now the talk of recession was happening, but now the seal is seen
 darasal is samay bharat main aarthik mandi chintaa kaa vishay he
 But how does a common man cope with recession
 vaise to aarthik mandi har ek varg ko prabhavit karti he
 But the middle class is affected the most, and is currently happening
 aise main kam aay vaale log kuch aarthik step uthaakar mandi ko maat de sakate hai
 Don't buy expensive gadgets India is a big market in the eyes of the world
 har roj yahaan nae gagetts launch ho rahe hai
 But buying expensive mobiles, tablets and laptops is never considered better from an investment perspective
 kyonki in gagetts par kiye gaye kharch kabhi ritern nahin detaa or na hi usapar koi byaaj miltaa he
 So, in the midst of the recession, low-income people keep away from expensive gadgets
 udaarahan ke taur par agar koi 60 hajaar rupee kaa mobile kharidta he to us gajet kaa vailu kharidari ke baad se hi kam ho jaataa he
 And in the next few months after use, the price of that mobile is just a few thousand rupees
 yahi nahin, kabhi bhi kisi gagetts kaa ricell vailu nahin hota he
 So if your income is limited, then in order to maintain the economic balance, instead of 60 thousand at present, you can also work with a mobile of 10 thousand rupees and invest the remaining 50 thousand rupees in an emergency fund or at the right place
 
 nivesh kii gai raashi dhire-dhire badhati jaaegi or kuch saal baad vah ek bada fund ban jayega
 If the balance between income and expenditure is necessary, if income is incomplete and expenditure is rupee, then financial health can never improve
 haa, agar aamadani rupaya or kharchaa athnni he to phir baaki ke athnni se kisi bhi lakshya ko hasil kiya ja saktaa he
 So always try to keep expenses down from income
 jab aap aay or kharch ke bich santulan bitha lenge to phir aarthik morche par kabhi jhatka nahin lagegaa
 Invest responsibly
 If you manage to keep a balance between income and expenses, then the savings avenues are opened
 lekin bachat ke baad us rakam kaa kahaan nivesh karen, iskaa faisla bhi lenaa padataa he
 If you continue to invest even a small amount at the right place, then you can easily achieve your goal
 kyonki ek din main amir banane kaa koi formula nahin he
 So always keep a focus on spending and investment

 In response to this question during a recent event, Rajan attributed this to the traditional technique of making dosa on the pan

 You know, even today, a person puts it (rice solution) on the pan, spreads it and puts it on the griddle and keeps it ready

 However, the wages of the person making the dosa are constantly rising, especially in a state like Kerala

 bihar main sthaneey swashaasan ne is vyavastha ko badal kar rakh diya he or sarpanch apana mahatv mukhiyaaon ke haathon kho baithe hai
 This is confirmed by the number of candidates for the post of chief in the 10-phase panchayat elections in Bihar
 rajya chunaav ayog ke upasachiv or jansampark adhikari rajeev rathore bataate hai, ''mukhiya pad kii daud main 79,423 ummidavaar hai

 The sarpanch has quasi judicial powers and can only settle petty financial disputes

 If you ask any BJP leader these days the capital of India, then maybe Patna will hear in response, not New Delhi
 yah bihar vidhansabha chunaav ko lekar party kii bechaini kaa sabab hi he
 In the Lok Sabha elections, the BJP, which holds the seat of Delhi, is finding it much more difficult than the election of Bihar, so the national president of the party, Amit Shah, left his office at Ashok Road in Delhi, with the entire Lashkar, 1,100 kilometers away in Patna
 The state BJP office at k Veerchand Patel has been made its center
 pehle charan kii voting se thik das din pehle shah ne patna main baithkar chunaav kii sidhi kaman sanbhali to phija badalte der nahin lagi
 According to Shah's strategy on former Chief Minister Lalu Prasad Yadav's statement on beef, the first attack came from Yaduvanshi leaders as Lalu was constantly involved in polarizing the Yadav vote bank
 3 aktubar ko lalu ke is vivaadaaspad bayaan par der raat shah ne kor team ke saath baithak lee or aadhi raat ko party ke media vibhaag kii apaat baithak bulaakar lalu ko gherne kii ranneeti ko anjaam diya
 Therefore, Union Minister of State Ramkripal Yadav, MP Hukmdev Narayan Yadav and MP Nityanand Rai took an aggressive approach the very next day, which also showed the effect and Lalu fell on the backfoot
 bijepi ke ek varisht ranneetikaar is badali phija par tippanee karte hai, “ham nahin chaahate the ki bihar kaa chunaav vikaas ke mudde se bhatke, lekin lalu ke bayaan se na chaahate hue bhi chunaav majahabi rang le chukaa he, jiskaa hamen sidhaa phayda hoga
 "actually, Shah realizes that there is no Modi wave like the Lok Sabha elections and the battle has been a thorn in the new coalition (lalu-nitish) which has emerged from the caste equations
" isliye micro management main maahir maane jane vaale shah ne tikaton ke bantwaare se thik pehle bihar main bhagava lahar paidaa karne kii ranneeti bana lee thi, jise lalu ke bayaan ne mauka diya to patna main hi deraa daale shah ne use lapakane main tanik bhi deree nahin kii
 
 
 
 aakhir kyon daalana padaa dirashaah brigade ko laav-lashkar ke saath dilli se patna yun hi kooch nahin karnaa padaa he
 After the victory of the Lok Sabha elections, when the BJP was preparing for the Bihar elections early, it felt that the electoral climate is completely in its favor and it will take over the power of Bihar, moving like a storm
 lekin jab jamini str par kaam shuru hua to bijepi ko ehsaas ho gaya ki muqabla aasaan nahin he
 She was assuming that by joining hands with Lalu, Nitish would go rogue in public and would not allow good governance and Jungle Raj's cocktails to get on the tongue
 lekin aisa nahin hua, ulate muqabla kadaa or dilachasp hota chalaa gaya
 Even if the arithmetic of caste was going in favor of the grand alliance, Shah felt that sitting in Delhi, it would not be possible to raise the electoral strategy on the issue of development
 udhar bihar se jude aar
 K
 singh, shatrughna sinha jaise kuch saansadon ke mukhar saarvajanik virodh ne bhi party kii ummiido par chot kii
 But according to sources, fears of disturbances from local leaders of Bihar also put the central leadership in a shambles, taking Shah very seriously and has pushed the team outside the state to the polls
 bijepi kii sabase badi mushkil baagi ummidavaaron ke khadey ho jane kii vajah se paidaa ho gai thi
 According to sources, around 80-100 contenders who had been denied tickets were preparing to stake an independent seat
 lekin shah brigade ke ranneetikaar chunaav prabharee anant kumaar or sah chunaav prabharee dharmendra pradhan ne puure 7 din sirf baagiyon se baat karne or unhen samajhane-bujhane main lagaae
 However, more than half a dozen rebels are still in the ground
 unka daawa he ki ab baagi ummidavaar party ke liye us tarah sirdard nahin hai, jaisaa ki hafte bhar pehle tak the
 But the displeasure of the ticket holders in pulling Shah to Patna is also a big reason
 party kaa anumaan he ki bihar chunaav main do gathbandhanon kii ladaai se itar lard rahi choti-choti partiyon or nirdaleeyon ko milakar 20-22 log chunaav jitkar aa sakate hai
 Therefore, in the event of a hung assembly, the party is already working on a strategy to pull these people into its court
 prabandhan kaa shahnuma khaakamatadaan kii tareekhen jyon-jyon najadik aa rahi hai, bijepi netritv kii dhadakanen bhi badhati ja rahi he
 The party does not want to leave a single thread of strategy
 bihar ko chaar jone main baantkar pehle se kaam kar rahi party ne ab 12 nae jone bana die hai or kendriya mantri se lekar varisht netaaon ko jilon kaa prabharee bana diya he
 The morning of Shah, who has been continuously staying in Patna since October 2, begins with a brief meeting in which he assigns a task to the leaders, whose report has to be kept with the facts in the evening meeting
 phir shah din bhar alag-alag kshetron main daura kar raat ke tisare pahar tak apni kor team ke saath puure din kii samiksha or agle din kii ranneeti par manthan karte hai
 How the Bihar election has become a question of prestige for the bjp's shah-modi duo can be easily understood by the comment of a senior leader of Bihar, "if you look at the leaders engaged in the Bihar elections, these days Shah is the most He is a busy politician, whose image is of the person who sleeps late and wakes up early to reach the party office
 ”shah ne apni kor team ko bhi teen shreniyon main baant diya he jisamen se ek sirf rajnatik ranneeti to duusari team santhnik or teesri team pradesh ke teenon varisht netaaon kii he jo nichle str par samanvay ko dekhte hai
 Shah is on a tour anywhere in the state, but from the war room himself takes reports thrice a day which contains information about booth management, publicity material, call centers
 iske alaava, waar room ke jariye khud is baat par nigaah rakhte hai ki kis vidhansabha kshetra main party ke ghoshnaptr (vijan dastavej) ko darshane vaale hordings kahaan lage hai or kahaan lagane chahie, patna se bheji gai prachaar saamagree kaa sahi se istemaal ho rahaa he yaa nahin jaisi choti-choti chizon par shah kii sidhi nigaah rahati he
 a BJP strategist explains, "shah, instead of asking anything about the assembly at any meeting, only talks about booths and always focuses on how booth workers encourage their family and neighbors to make people To be brought to the polling station
 ” shah ke patna main camp karne ko ghabrahat kii bajaae pradesh ke netaa nirnay main tivrata se jodate hai or sthaneey netaaon kaa maananaa he ki adhyaksh ke khud maujuud rahane se saare faisle tabadatod ho rahe hai or asamanjas kii sthiti yaa dilli se hari jhandi kaa koi intjaar nahin karnaa padataa
 Every day 8 helicopters fly in the morning, in which the tour of the leaders of the NDA constituents is also decided by the BJP
 shah kii santhnik taiyaari kii nigaraanee patna main baithkar khud rashtriya sanghathan mahasachiv raamalaal karte hai to jameen par use dhar dene kii jimmedaari mukhya taur se rashtriya sah sanghathan mantri saudaan singh or bihar ikai ke sanghathan mantri nagendra nibhaa rahe hai
 In the last 10 days, Saudan Singh has visited 81 assembly seats in the first and second phase
 is daure main chunaav ladgaye vaale ummidavaaron se itar ve jiladhyaksh, mandal adhyaksh, vidhansabha prabharee or pravasi kaaryakartaaon samet gine-chune 8-10 logon ke saath baithak karte hai
 In these meetings, booth management, problems with feedback and persuading angry activists are considered and from there, the shortcomings are removed immediately through phone
 yani ek din main 10 se 12 vidhansabha siton kii baithken sanghathan ke str par jari hai
 Ramlal and Saudan reached Delhi on 10 October before the first phase of voting, but preparations for the second phase have been made
 bihari par baari pravasiiske alaava pehle se bane chaar centre kii jikvamedaari sanghathan ke ranneetikaron ne sambhaal rakhi he
 Dhan Singh Rawat, vice-president of Uttarakhand BJP and organization minister for a decade, has been standing at Supaul Center for three consecutive months
 iske alaava uttar pradesh ke sanghathan mantri sunil bansal bhi 8 jilon kii vyavastha ko dekh rahe hai
 Organizational Minister of Jharkhand Rajendra Singh is contesting the elections himself, while Madhya Pradesh Organization Minister Arvind Menon is also camping in Bihar
 sutron ke mutabik, tikat ko lekar machi hode ke baad maayoos kaaryakartaaon main naaraazgi, saansadon kii upeksha or mukhyamantri ummidavaar ghoshit nahin hone se party ke andruni asamanjas se kendriya netritv ko yah ashanka thi ki sthaneey str par bhitarghaat dilli chunaav kii tarah hi nuksaan kar saktaa he
 Therefore, Shah has put the organization's expert players from outside Bihar in the management from booth to zone, assembly and state BJP headquarters
 pehle se bane chaar jone kii jimmedaari bahari netaaon ke haath to thi hi, ab bane nae 12 jone main kendriya mantriyon, bihar ke saansadon ko jagah di gai he, lekin har jone main bahari netaa ko mukhya jimmedaari dekar nigaraanee ko durust kiya gaya he
 Union Minister of Health J
 pi
 Nadda, Steel Minister Narendra Singh Tomar, Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh, Communications Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, Ram Kripal Yadav, Giriraj Singh etc
 have been deployed with their team at the district level
 iske alaava mahasachiv kailash vijayawargeey, mumbai bijepi ke adhyaksh ashish shellar, saansad prahlaad patel, loksabhaa main bijepi ke mukhya sachetak arjuna meghavaal, bijepi upaadhyaksh shyaam jaju, saansad mahesh giri bhi jila str par kaam kar rahe hai
 In every zone, some union officials have also been added so that coordination can be improved
 bijepi ke liye kaam kar rahe pravasi netaaon kii sankhya 700 se zyada he
 But a party general secretary says that there are at least 10-15 migrant workers in every assembly
 yani yah sankhya 4,000 se zyada he
 From the system of Bihar BJP office to the responsibility of all the programs of the leaders, the National General Secretary, Dr
 anil jain dekh rahe hai
 Shah has also devised a strategy for publicity
 party yah maanakar chal rahi he ki kaante ke mukaable main antim samay main maahaul dekhakar vot kaa nirnay lene vaale logon ko bijepi ke paksh main aakarshith kiya ja sake
 Therefore, the party had earlier planned the strategy of one rally each in every Lok Sabha constituency of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, but doing so would have sent a message of panic
 lihaaja party ne ab har charan main modi se do din chunaav prachaar karne ke liye unki sahmati le lee he or iske tahat 22 reliyon kii ranneeti banaai gai he
 Apart from this, Home Minister Rajnath Singh, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj, HRD Minister Smriti Irani and Bhojpuri films superstar and BJP MP Manoj Tiwari will continue to hold rallies
 party ne voting se pehle ke saptaah main har vidhansabha main star prachaarkon kii kam se kam teen or pradesh bhar main 500 reliyon kaa khaakaa banaaya he
 It is clear that the bjp's strategy now is to create an atmosphere in its favor in the face of thorns in Bihar, but will the BJP, who tasted the bitter experience of micro management in Delhi, be able to break the deep caste casteism in the roots of Bihar? eke-47 esalt rifl ke liye duniya main mashhoor roosi company clashnicove ne apni chhavi ko nikhaarane kii yojana ke tahat ek nayaa logo va tagaline apanaaya he
 The company has described its weapons as weapons of peace

 This rifle is popular among security forces as well as terrorist organizations in the continent of Asia and Africa

 Along with this, this weapon company has also adopted a new slogan or slogan

 raksha mantri manohar parikr ne aaj atyaadhunik tarpedo varunastra ko nausena ko saunp diya
 Developed in drdo's lab, the torpedo can attack and destroy an enemy submarine or vessel at a speed of 40 knots under the sea
 swadeshi hathiyaaron ke nirmaan kii disha main varunastra ko desh kii badi uplabdhi mana ja rahaa he

 pandubbiyon ke alaava isko kai jangi poton main bhi feet kiya ja saktaa he
 With whom it can destroy other war ships
 varunastra ek haiviveet or advance tarpedo he
 Earlier, torpedoes developed by DRDO were light and short range
 nausena main shaamil hokar yah tarpedo dilli, kolkata or camorta shrenee ke yupoton main feet kiya jayega
 However, the firepower of this torpedo has not been officially disclosed
 tippaniyan DRDO has also helped in making Varunastra by the National Institute of Ocean Technology

 Rameshwar Teli is also an MP from this seat
 ek jamaane main congress kaa is seat par kabja hua karata tha
 Since 2014, the BJP is strengthening its hold in the northeastern states
 yah seat assam ke mukhyamantri sarbanand sonwal kii bhi rahi he
 He won a big victory in the 2004 Lok Sabha elections
 assam kii dibrugarh loksabhaa seat se congress ne pawan singh ghotwar ko pratyaashee banaaya he
 The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has once again made Rameshwar Teli its face
 bahujan mukti party se doctor titus bhengra chunaav lard rahe hai

 In all, 8 candidates are contesting from Dibrugarh
 raajnneetik sameekaran kii baat karen to dibrugarh kii 9 vidhansabha siton main se 8 par bijepi or 1 assam gana parishad ke paas he
 Dibrugarh Lok Sabha seat was won by Congress candidate Jogendra Nath Hazarika four times in a row
 1952 main hue pehle loksabhaa chunaav se lekar 1967 ke chunaav tak ve hi jite the
 After this, Congress candidate Rabindranath Kakoti also won in 1971
 1977 ke chunaav main congress ke tikat par jeetne vaale haren bhumij ne 1985 kaa chunaav assam gana parishad ke tikat se jeeta tha
 From 1991 to 1999, this seat again remained with the Congress
 yahaan se paban singh ghatowar lagaataar chaar baar chunaav jeet kar sansad pahunche
 In the 2004 election, Sarbananda Sonowal won the election on the ticket of Asom Gana Parishad

 com / v8nocje893 saamaajik kaaryakarta anna hajaare ne bhrashtachar ke khilaaf andolan kya shuru kiya, gandhi topi kaa jamaana laut aayaa
 Now not only the political parties are promoting the Gandhi cap, but the mass organizations are also forgetting to wear the cap
 fark sirf itnaa he ki pehle gandhi topi saadi-safed hoti thi, ab slogan likhi or rangeen bhi hoti he
 When Mahatma Gandhi started the Satyagraha movement during the freedom struggle, the white veneer symbol of peace was adopted
 tabhi se andolan se jude swatantraaa sangram senaniyon ne sir par safed topi pahanane kii bhi shuruyaat kii
 Later this became the dress of the leaders
 topi kaa naam 'gandhi topi' pad gaya
 People associated with freedom movement still do not forget to wear Gandhi cap
 dhire-dhire aadhuniktaa ke daur va fishan kii vajah se netaaon ne topi pahananaa band kar diya
 Gamcha took her place
 raajnneetik dalon ke netaaon va kaaryakartaaon main apni-apni party ke rang ke anuroop kandhe par gamchaa rakhane kaa prachlan shuru hua
 The tradition of wearing hat-like hats along with skins started at party functions
 topi va jhanda binar kii dukaanon par bhi hat va gamche kii demand bad gai
 But after the Anna movement started in April 2011, the demand for 'gandhi Topi' once again increased
 fark itnaa rahaa ki saadi topi kii jagah uske donon ore 'main hum anna' yaa 'mujhe chahie jan lokapal' likhi topi bazaar main utar ai
 People also started calling it 'anna Topi'
 us samay anna hajaare ke andolan ko puure desh main jamkar samarthan mila
 People going out on the road used to have caps on their heads
 'anna topi' kaa asar itnaa badha ki maujuuda samay main lagbhag sabhi partiyaan topi kaa istemaal karne lageen
 Be it BJP, Congress or other parties
 party kaaryakramon main kaaryakartaaon ke sir par hat jaisi topi kii jagah phir gandhi style kii topi najar aane lagi
 BJP saffron, Congress saffron, green and white striped hats are seen
 basapa ke kaaryakarta bhi usee style kii topi nile rang main pahane najar aane lage
 Kind sentences are also written on the caps
 raajnneetik partiyon ke saath andolan kar rahe vibhinn sanghathan bhi topi pahanakar apni aawaaj buland kar rahe hai
 He is already ordering hats for the movement
 is bare main raajnneetik partiyon ke jhanda, binar va topi ke thok vikreta shila inter prijej ke rajesh agarwal kaa kahana he, 'anna andolan ke saath hi topi kii maang kaaphi badi he
 Earlier Gandhi cap was sold in the year around 5000
 15 agast va 26 janvari or gandhi jayanti par hi vishesh maang hoti thi, lekin ab itani maang bad gai he ki aapurti karnaa mushkil ho rahaa he
 'along with political parties, other organizations are also ordering cap orders
 har maah ausatan paanch se saat hajaar gandhi topi kii maang aa rahi he
 General elections are yet to come, see what happens next

 uttar pradesh ke gajiabad main police kaa sabase bada ghotla saamne aayaa he
 The police kept most of the money recovered from the accused themselves
 jab aaj iskaa khulaasa kiya to thana prabharee sahit saat police karmiyon ko suspend kar un par mukadmaa darj kar liya gaya
 The policemen suspended include Inspector Laxmi Chauhan of Police Station Road, Ghaziabad, Sub Inspector Naveen Pachauri and five constables Bachhu Singh, Faraz, Dheeraj, Saurabh and Sachin

 itani badi rakam haath lagate hi lakshmi chouhan or unki team kii imaan dol gaya or baramadagi main herpher karte hue sirf 45 lakh rupee dikhaae
 Due to the handiwork of these policemen, once again the Uttar Pradesh Police Department has been stained
 desh main bhale hi upi chunaav kaa hangaamaa ho, lekin dilli main gurudwara prabandhak cameti ke liye ghamaasan kisi bade chunaav se kam nahin
 Those who are aware of Delhi's politics also know the importance of the DSGPC election, because holding the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee also implies the attitude of Sikh politics
 dilli sikh gurudwara prabandhak cameti ke chunaav 26 farvari ko hone hai or iske liye zordaar takkar chal rahi he
 The DSGPC is currently occupied by the Manjit Singh GK faction of the Shiromani Akali Dal and the Sarna Bandhu of the Akali Dal Delhi
 haalanki is baar panthak seva dal naam se ek nayaa gut bhi chunavi maidan main he or kaha ja rahaa he ki panthak seva dal ko aam aadmi party kaa samarthan hasil he
 There are a total of 46 wards in Delhi for DSGPC, under which management of gurdwaras across Delhi comes
 iske saath hi dsipisi kai skool, college, hospital or duusari saamaajik sansthaaon kaa bhi sanchaalan karti he
 This time a total of 376 candidates are in the fray for the 46 seats of DSGPC and the contest is considered to be a thorn
 mana yah jaataa he ki dilli main dsipisi ke chunaav nattejey main punjab kii raajnneetik hawa kaa ishaara miltaa he
 Although this time the Punjab elections were held before the DSGPC elections, the results of the DSGPC will come before the Punjab Assembly results
 yahi nahin is baar aam aadmi party ke samarthan kaa daawa karne vaala ek dal panthak seva dal bhi maidan main he, to dilli ke sikh samaaj main kejariwal kii party kaa aadhaar kaa andaaza bhi in chunaavon se lagaaya ja rahaa he
 However, the Aam Aadmi Party is refusing to give open support
 haalanki is baar congress samarthak maane jane vaale paramjeet sarna apni jeet kaa daawa kar rahe hai or shiromani akali dal par gadabadiyon kaa aarope laga rahe hai
 Sarna says that during the tenure of Manjit Singh GK, Sikhism has become disrespected and has made a religious institution completely political
 vahiin jike gut ke manjinder singh sirsa daawa kar rahe hai ki sarna bandhuon kii asaliyat unke pichley kaarykaal main hi saamne aa gai thi
 Therefore, now the people of Sikh society are not going to trust them
 vahiin aam aadmi party chori chupe gurudwara chunaav main apni dakhlandaazi karne kii koshish kar rahi he, lekin unka koi aadhaar nahin he or vah chaaron khaane chitt honge
 During this time both the parties are claiming that they have neither taken help from any political party nor used any leader for campaigning, but this election of Gurdwara is not so un-political
 khayr 26 farvari ko voting ke baad 1 march ko gurudwara prabandhak cameti ke nattejey aaenge
 Even though these elections belong to the committee managing the gurudwaras, the results will have many political implications
 yon shoshan ke khilaaf desh main chal rahe # metoo campan kii chapet abhinayta or netaa ke baad ab purv jaj bhi aa gaye hai
 a woman lawyer has filed a PIL in the Supreme Court against former Attorney General Soli Sorabjee, accusing her of continuous sexual harassment
 psorabji ne 'ajtak' se baatcheet main in sabhi aaropon ko aadharahin or jhootha qaraar diya he
 She clarified the allegations and said that it is her (female lawyer) habit to make allegations against people and in the past she has made such allegations against many judges and lawyers
 psorabji ne kaha ki wo mahila ke khilaaf court nahin jaaenge lekin unhen usapar taras jarur aa rahaa he
 The former Attorney General said that he has always seen that woman as a junior lawyer, he does not know why the woman has made such allegations against him
 psorabji ne aaropon ko managasaint qaraar diya he
 The petition against Soli Sorabjee has been filed at a time when the ministers in the central government are facing charges ranging from MJ Akbar to actors Nana Patekar, Alok Nath, Rajat Kapoor, singer Kailash Kher, writer Chetan Bhagat
 is campan ke tahat kaarysthal se lekar nijee jagahon par yon utpeedan kaa saamana kar chukin mahilaayein khulaam soshal media par apni shikaayat darj kara rahi hai
 Justifying the campaign, Jayassorabji also justified the # metoo campaign and said that it is a good thing, because women are speaking openly on this excuse
 haalanki unhone isamen galat shikayaton kaa andeshaa jaahir karte hue campan ke galat istemaal kaa bhi shaq jataayaa he, jisase kisi kii chhavi dhoomil ho sakati he
 The former Attorney General said that the women who are making allegations, along with the evidence, should also be asked why they have not come forward yet
 agar aisa nahin hota, to yah aarope sirf kisi ko chhavi ko kharaab hi kar sakate hai

 salwa judum ke shuru hone ke saath aasapaas ke ilaakon ke bacchon ke bhavishya ke raste band ho gaye the
 The fear of Naxalites was such that the schools of Jagrgunda, Anganwadi, ration shops all had to shift to Dornapal, 70 km away
 sukama ke colector chandan kumaar kehete hai ki jagargunda kaa skool ashram san 2006 ke baad se sanchalit nahin ho paa rahaa tha kyonki vahaan naksalwad kii kaaphi zyada samasya thi
 And there after Salwa Judum, all the people and organizations were to be brought to the side of the road, those who survived were staying in the camp
 vahaan ke logon ko bahut pareshaani ho rahi thi, isliye rajya shashan ne nirnay liya ki skool vahaan waapas jaaenge
 Since 2005, people in Jagargunda started migrating due to different reasons
 kisi ko naksaliyon kaa dar to kisi ko police kaa khauf
 As primary and middle school went on, the high school and higher secondary classes closed down
 bacchon ko padhai ke liye dornapal kii 70 kilometre kii duuri tay kerani padati thi
 The forest, the closure of the paths in the rain and two-four of the troubles was a daily story for the children

 lekin isse unhen safalataa nahin mili
 He had to struggle till the success of 'mehdi Lagi Mere Hath (1962)' and 'jab Jab Jab Phool Khile (1965)'
 in filmon ke pradarshan ke saath hi unako lokapriyata milani shuru ho gai
 Fantastic songs like 'pardesi se na aankhiyan' and 'yeh sama hai pyar ka' made him very popular
 iske baad film 'milan(1967)' ke pradarshan ke saath hi vah geetkaaron kii shrenee main sabase upar aa gayi
 He never had to look back again
 prem geeton ke safal rachanaakargitkaar anand bakshi ne sangeetkaar lakshmikant-pyarelal ke saath milakar 'farz(1967)', 'do raste(1969)', 'bobi(1973'), 'amar akbar anthoni(1977)', 'ek duje ke liye(1981)' or rahul dev burman ke saath 'kati patang(1970)', 'amar prem(1971)', hare rama hare krishna(1971)' or 'lav story(1981)' filmon main amar geet diye

 First, the government of Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mufti Mohammed Saeed issued an ordinance saying that it would be necessary to hoist the state flag with the tricolor in the state on government buildings and vehicles, but late night issued another order saying that it is not necessary at the moment is
 sarkaar ne tark diya he ki pehle galati se aadesh jari kar diya gaya tha
 Earlier, Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mufti Muhammad Saeed gave another blow to the BJP, however the government withdrew the decision as the dispute escalated
 pehle rajya sarkaar ne ek aadesh jari kar kaha tha ki ab rajya main sanvaidhanik padon par baithe logon tathaa un sabhi imaaraton par jahaan bhartiya tirangaa fahraaya jaataa he vahaan par tirange ke saath hi rajya kaa jhanda bhi fahraana jaruri hoga
 Failure to do so has a provision for punishment
 mufti sarkaar kaa yah faisla bijepi kii us maang or us naare kaa ‘jawaab’ mana ja rahaa tha, jisamen vah rajya se do samvidhan or do nishaan hataane kii maang karti rahi he
 It is reported that the mufti government is due to bring this ordinance that some BJP ministers were reluctant to put the state flag from their government vehicles
 vaise jammu-kashmir main rajya kaa apana samvidhan hone ke kaaran sarkari vaahanon or sarkari imaaraton par tirange ke saath hi rajya kaa jhanda ko bhi fahraana jaruri hota he
 The government has taken this step by implementing the Delhi Agreement of 1952
 kaha ja rahaa he ye aadesh phir mufti ke kehane par hi jari hua tha, kyonki unke paas hi saamaanya prashasnic vibhaag kaa kaarybhaar bhi he
 According to this ordinance, if someone insults the state flag or does not follow the instructions related to it, then the same action will be taken against him as done on the insult of the tricolor
 vaise isko lekar jammu-kashmir hycourt main ek maamla bhi chal rahaa he, jisamen sarkari imaaraton or vaahanon par rajya kaa jhanda fahraana anivaary tathaa saath hi rajya kaa apana ganatantr diwas bhi manaane kii maang par maamla chal rahaa he

 nyaayalay ne yachikakarta ko is maamle par sunwaayee ke liye upyukt ucch nyaayalay kii sharan main jane ko kaha
 The petitioner contended that the Constitution does not refer to the nomination of any one person from the sports category to the Rajya Sabha
 sisodiya ne apni yachika main kaha tha ki samvidhan kii dhara 80 (3) ke mutabik rajya sabha ke liye sahitya, vigyaan, kala or samaajik sevaaon ke kshetra kii hastiyon ko manonith kiya ja saktaa he lekin isamen khel jagat kii hastiyon ko namankit kiye jane kaa koi praavdhaan nahin he

 The World Health Organization runs awareness campaigns on blood donation and this is why World Blood Donor Day (world Blood Donation Day) is celebrated on 14 June in countries around the world
 is din jaagarukta abhiyaan chalaaya jaataa he or janamanas ko muft raktadan karne ke liye prerit kiya jaataa he
 But few people will know that even though the WHO has decided to one day for the World Blood Donor Day, it was Karl Landsteiner who made blood donation possible
 karl landstiner ko aadhunik blad transfusion kaa pitamah kaha jaataa he or yahi vajah he ki unke janmdin yani ki 14 june kovishwa raktadan divasake rup main manaaya jaataa he
 Shivaji was the first to give the country the navy, know many unheard of things
 Karl Landsteiner was born on 14 June 1868
 saal 1901 main karl ne A,B,O jaise blad group kaa pataa lagaaya
 Not only this, he also detected polio virus in the year 1909
 iske baad hi polio ko niyantrit karne kaa abhiyaan shuru kiya gaya
 Karl's most important discovery is to discover the system associated with the separation of the blood group, and the 1937 rhesus factor in association with Alexander Weiner, which makes it possible to bleed
