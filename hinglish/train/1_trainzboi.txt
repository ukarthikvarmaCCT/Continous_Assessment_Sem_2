 udhar bijepi ne apane kaddavar netaa gujarat ke mukhyamantrinarendra modiko bhi karnataka vidhansabha chunaav ke prachaar main utaara, lekin unka jaadu bhi yahaan nahin chalaa
 That is, along with the BJP president, Modi too could not overcome the bjp's corrupt government in Karnataka
 karnataka chunaav parinaam ke mukhya ansh|vidhansabha kshetra ke anusaar parinamvidhansabha chunaav kii matganana ke mutabik bijepi tisare number par aati dikh rahi he
 The party seems to be limited to only 39 seats
 mukhyamantri jagadish shettar haalanki, uttari karnataka kii hubli-dharwar madhya seat par badhat banaae hue hai lekin kai kaddavar netaa vahaan haar kii kagaar par khadey hai
 Alam is that of the current Deputy Chief Minister
 es
 Many ministers including Eshwarappa are also following
 ishwarappa shimoga seat par peeche chal rahe hai
 Apart from him Law minister
s
 suresh kumaar bengaluru ke rajajinagar or murugesh niraani uttari karnataka ke bagalkot jile ke bilagi vidhansabha kshetra main pichad rahe hai
 That is, the BJP has got a clean sweep here
 bijepi ke paas 1985 main yahaan 2 vidhansabha siten mili thim
 While the party won 40 seats here in 1994
 1999 main hue chunaavon main use 44 siton se santosh karnaa padaa tha jabaki 2004 main use 79 siten mili thim
 In the 2008 assembly elections, BJP registered an unprecedented victory and won 110 seats
 tab party ne paanch nirdaleey ummidavaaron kii madad se rajya main pehali baar sarkaar banaai thi
 But he had to bear the full brunt of changing the chief minister thrice amid allegations of wrong policies of the party and incessant corruption
 itnaa hi nahin vahaan ke mukhyamantri bi es yediurppa par bhi bhrashtachar ke aarope lage or unhen jail bhi janaa padaa
 He was then expelled from the party
 yediurppa ne baad main karnataka janata party (kegepi) kaa gathan kiya or aaj vahi yediurppa is chunaav main bijepi ke gale kii haddi ban gaye
 Yeddyurappa's party may be winning only 8 seats in this assembly election but it is certain that KJP has made a tremendous dent in bjp's vote bank and has become a major factor in bjp's defeat
 ab isi saal chaar rajyon dilli, rajasthan, madhya pradesh or chhattisgarh main vidhansabha chunaav or uske baad agle saal loksabhaa chunaav hone hai

 For Rohit Sharma, who is going through bad form, it will not be easy to return

 On the other hand, the Kiwi team, which lost the Test series 0–2, will come back with the intention of reversing

 In such a situation, the batsmen of the team headed by Captain Ross Taylor need to play in front of the spinners
 tej gendbaaj dag breswell or tim soudi bhartiya ballebaajon ke liye sirdard sabit ho sakate hai jabaki harfanmaulaa jaikab oram gendbaaji ke alaava ballebaaji main bhi lambe-lambe shot lagane main maahir hai
 In Ballbaji, the Kiwi team will rely more on Brandon mccullum, Martin Guptill, Taylor and Kane Williamson
 oram ke saath james franklin bhi harfanmaulaa khilaadi kii bhoomika nibhaane main sakasham hai
 The spin responsibility will remain on the shoulders of veteran Daniel Vettori

 Lalu Prasad Yadav, once called Baazigar of Bihar's politics, is away from the political picture of Bihar in the most difficult period of RJD and his family
 lalu ranchi main chaara ghotaale ke cese main sajaa kaat rahe hai
 Lalu's elder son Tejapratap Yadav has adopted a rebel stance amid the political Mahabharata continuing for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 loksabhaa chunaav ke tikaton ke vitaran main apni nahin chalane se gussaye tejpratap ne somvaar ko alag party lalu rabari morcha ke naam se banane kaa elaan kar diya

 On Friday, Tej Pratap also resigned as the guardian of the student RJD

 Chandra Prakashtej Pratap announced on Friday that he would field his candidates from Jehanabad and Shivahar
 jahanabad se chandra prakaash unke morche ke ummidavaar hai
 While rjd's official candidate from Jehanabad is Surendra Prasad Yadav
 surendra prasad yadav jahanabad se argedy ke pehle bhi saansad rah chuke hai
 Tejapratap's very good friend Chandra Prakash is also a Yadav by caste
 agar chandra prakaash chunaav main date rahe to argedy ko is seat par nuksaan ho saktaa he
 Chandra Prakash describes the political fight in Jehanabad as local versus outsider and says that Surendra Prasad Yadav does not belong here

 Like Angesh Singh, Tej Pratap was adamant on getting ticket from Shivhar to Angesh Singh
 shivahar seat par argedy ke vidhayak abu dojaanaa chunaav ladanaa chaahate hai
 Ambesh was the candidate from this seat
 ab tej pratap ne angesh ko apane morche kaa ummidavaar ghoshit kar diya he
 However, Tejashwi is yet to announce the candidate from Shivahar
 darasal tej pratap jab bihar ke kai ilaakon main badlaav yatra par nikle the to angesh or chandra prakaash ne sanghathan kshamta se unhen prabhavit kiya tha
 Tej Pratap now wants to give his message to supporters by giving them tickets

 patni aishwarya se chal rahe talaak ke bich tej pratap ko ye katai bardaasht nahin hua ki party chandrika raay ko loksabhaa kaa tikat de
 In fact, in the list released by Tejashwi on Friday, Chandrika Rai was announced to be removed from Saran seat

 rajendra pasvanalalu ke bade bete tej pratap pichley saal june se hi party main pratishtha paane ke liye ladaai lard rahe hai

 In particular, RJD state president Ramchandra Purve lives on the target of Tej Pratap

 vitt mantri arun jetali ne aam bajet 2018 main kisaanon kii aay 2022 tak doguni karne ke liye vishesh praavdhaan kiye hai
 In this, he has asked farmers to increase the MSP by 50 per cent or one and a half times the cost of their crops
 aaie jaanate hai ki iske kya myne hai, yah edia kahaan se aayaa or kisaanon ko asal main iskaa kitna phayda milane ja rahaa he
 In 2004, the UPA government created the National Commission for Farmers
 iskaa lakshya bharat main kheti, khadyann utpaadan, sookhe kii samasya se nipatane ke liye apane suzav dena tha
 This commission came to be known as Swaminathan Commission
 kamishan ne apni report (2006) main kisaanon ko fasalon par ai laagat kaa 50 fisadi emspi dene ko kaha tha
 There are three types of costs on crops in India
 This commission divided the cost of crops into three parts - A2, A2 + FL and C2
 A2 laagat main kisaanon ke fasal utpaadan main kiye gaye sabhi tarah ke nagdi kharch shaamil hote hai
 This includes the costs of seeds, fertilizers, chemicals, labor costs, fuel costs, irrigation, etc
 A2+FL laagat main nagdi laagat ke saath hi parivaar ke sadasyon kii mehnat kii anumaanit laagat ko bhi joda jaataa he
 At the same time, C2 cost includes cash and non-cash in crop production as well as lease rent on land and interest on agricultural capital other than land
 jetali ne kii he golmol baat, kuch bhi saaf nahinvitt mantri arun jetali ne kaha ki kisaanon ko unki fasal main laagat par 50 fisadi emspi milegaa
 However, he did not specify what cost the MSP would get
 swaminathan kamishan aane ke baad se kisaanon kii laagat ko teen shreniyon main gina jaataa he
 If farmers get 50 percent MSP at C2 cost then it can be a matter of benefit for them only
 A2 laagat main 50 fisadi milane par unhen laagat kaa kaaphi kam mulya milegaa
 a farmer will sell wheat at a loss of Rs 144 per farmer
 According to an estimate, the A2 + FL cost of wheat produced in 2017-18 is Rs 817 per quintal
 isamen 50 fisadi laagat jod dene se emspi 1325 rupee prati kuntal ho jaati he
 The C2 cost of wheat itself is Rs 1256 per quintal and adding 50 per cent more cost to it, the MSP is Rs 1879 per quintal
 maujuuda centre sarkaar ne oktober 2017 main gehun kaa emspi 1735 rupee kuntal tay kiya tha
 In this way, the farmer will get Rs
 144 less per quintal of wheat
 koi taiyaari nahin, kaise dilavaayenge emspi?yah bhi yaad rakhaa janaa chahie ki desh ke keval 6 fisadi kisaanon ko hi unki fasal par emspi mil paata he
 The rest of the farmers' crop goes to the middlemen, moneylenders and other brokers
 vitt mantri ne yah bhi saaf nahin kiya he ki 94 fisadi kisaanon ko emspi dilwane ke liye kya intjaam kiye jaaenge
 How to ensure their procurement is delivered to government procurement centers is the biggest question
 bina praavdhaanon ke kaise doguni hogi kisaanon kii aay?krishi kshetra ko pichley saal mili bajet se is baar ke bajet kii tulana kii jaae to 2022 tak kisaanon kii aay doguni karne kaa vaada bhi jameen par utarataa najar nahin aa rahaa he
 Rs 41,886 crore was allocated for the agriculture sector in 2017-18, which was later revised to Rs 41,105 crore
 is baar ke bajet main 2018-19 main is aavanton ko badhaakar 46,700 karod rupee kiya gaya he
 That is, how can farmers' income be doubled by increasing only Rs 4,845 crore
 yah sawaal bhi anuttarit he
 UPA-2 vs NDA, Who gave what to farmers? Yogendra Yadav says that the Finance Minister has promised to increase the MSP of 50% of the cost to the farmers in this budget, which will not give them any benefit
 ajtak se baatcheet main yadav ne kaha ki upie sarkaar laagat kaa 70 fisadi emspi de rahi thi
 This table shows why fm's declaration is meaningless
 He has aiming to achieve what the UPA government had already achieved
 In fact his NDA govt has further brought down returns over 'A2 + FL'

 The BJP is giving 40 to 50 percent more MSP to farmers at the same cost
 unhone is ke jariye bataane kii koshish kii he ki kaise endie sarkaar kisaanon kaa aay doguna karne kaa jhansa de rahi he
 In the family of Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar, there has been a fight over the politics of heritage
 is ladaai ke centre main hai unke do pote
 One grandson is Partha Pawar, who was fielded by Sharad Pawar from his Lok Sabha seat this year
 duusare unke divangat bade bai appa sahib pavaar ke pote rohit pavaar hai
 While Sharad Pawar's MP daughter Supriya Sule has become active in Delhi politics
 aise main maharashtra kii raajnneeti kaa vaaris banane ke liye in do poton main andarkhaane jang chhidi he
 However, after Parth Pawar lost the election by more than two lakh votes, now Rohit Pawar has an edge
 dada sharad pavaar kii seat ganvaakar parth pavaar parivaar se chunaav haarane vaale pehle sadsy ban gaye hai
 The first glimpse of the struggle over the politics of inheritance in the 'pawar family' was seen during the Lok Sabha elections
 jab ensipi supremeo sharad pavaar ne loksabhaa chunaav na ladane kaa faisla karte hue apni seat pote parth pavaar ko saunp di
 Rohit Pawar then wrote a Facebook post asking Dada Sharad Pawar to reconsider his decision
 hafington post main chhapi ek report main is ghatnakram ko lekar parth pavaar kehete hai ki unhone (rohit) ne mere chunaav main prachaar kiya
 But his cousin should not have written a Facebook post like this
 bakaul parth," yadi aap phone uthaane or phone karne kii jagah apane pita yaa dada ko patr likhte hai to mujhe lagata he ki yah morrkhtaa he
 He really had to talk to his grandfather and not write a letter to show affection
 ise logon ne galat rup main liya
 "when contacted, Rohit said, 'we are all together
 hamamen se kisi ne ek duusare ke khilaaf saarvajanik rup se kuch nahin bolaa he
 Recently, Rohit's presence with Sharad Pawar has started to look a bit more
 jab loksabhaa chunaav main ensipi kii haar par sharad pavaar ne media ko sambodhit kiya tha, tabase rohit unke saath-saath dikhte rahe hai
 Due to this, there are talks about Rohit going ahead in the race to become political heir
 pavaar parivaar kii siyaasi jadensharad pavaar ke sabase bade bhai dinkarrav govindrav pavaar urf appa sahib pavaar the
 He was the first member of the Pawar family to enter politics
 maharashtra main kisaanon or mazdooron ke hiton kii ladaai ladane vaale bade netaa ke taur par unhone pahchaan banaai
 Appa Saheb later persuaded his younger brother Sharad Pawar to join the Congress
 1999 main sonia gandhi se takaraav ke baad congress se nikaale jane ke baad sharad pavaar ne neshnal congress party banaai
 After this, the Pawar family dominated the politics of Maharashtra
 beti supriya sule party se saansad banati raheen
 At the same time, Sharad Pawar also promoted Ajit Pawar, son of another brother Anantrao
 ajit maharashtra main rajaneta ke rup main ubharne main safal rahe
 He also became deputy CM in ncp-congress alliance
 appa sahib ke pote rohit ke saamne aane se pehle tak ajit pavaar ke bete parth ko hi pavaar femily kaa uttaradhikari mana ja rahaa tha
 In 2017, Rohit won the Zilla Parishad election from the Pawar family's home town of Baramati
 tab se vah khamoshi ke saath rajya main apni jameen banaate rahe
 Many party workers in NCP see him as the real populist after Sharad Pawar
 parth ke vipareet vah bade aatmavishvaas ke saath saarvajanik maujuudagi darj karaate hai
 a party leader in pimpri-chinchwad said, "ajit Dada is not accessible, people are afraid to talk to him
 supriya dilli kii raajnneeti main biji hai
 Parth treats himself as a big politician
 rohit apwaad hai, vah kaaryakartaaon se judate hai
 In them we see the image of Sharad Pawar
 " party kaaryakartaaon ke ek varg kaa kahana he ki appa sahib ne hi sharad pavaar ko raajnneeti main utaara tha
 In such a situation, Rohit should come forward
 yah puche jane ki kya vah khud ko sharad pavaar kaa raajnneetik vaaris maanate hai, rohit kahet hai, 'party ke netaa raajnneetik vaaris tay nahin karte
 This public decides
 main raajnneeti main rahete hue samaaj or rajya ke liye kuch karnaa chaahunga
 On the other hand, Parth also dismisses any family dispute
 sutara bataa rahe hai ki aane vaale vidhansabha chunaav main rohit pavaar ek kathin seat chunakar lard sakate hai
 So that he will not be tempted to succeed with the help of family heritage
 ek party netaa kaa kahana he ki agar rohit chunaav haarate hai to bhi party kaaryakarta unase sahanubhuti rakhenge
 Activists would think that Ajit Pawar and his son did not let him succeed
 kul milakar rohit res main aage dikh rahe hai
 The Delhi High Court has issued notices to the Center and the Delhi government for not complying with court orders despite banning the sale of drugs online
 dilli hoicourt ne 12 disambar ko ek janhit yachika par sunwaayee karte hue online farmesi par roak laga di thi
 In the hearing held on Wednesday, the petitioner stated that the previous orders of the court were also not being followed and the online pharmacies were indiscriminately making home delivery of medicines
 dermatologist jahir ahamed kii taraf se lagaai gai yachika par sunwaayee karte hue court ne centre sarkaar or dilli sarkaar ko notice jari kar iskaa jawaab maanga he
 The court recognized that the health of the people cannot be played with and it needs to be checked immediately
 dilli, mumbai, kolkata or chennai jaise metro shaharon main dawaaon kii online bikri kaa bahut bada kaarobaar he, or online bik rahi in dawaaon par rajya sarkaron ke saath saath centre sarkaar kaa ankush bhi na ke baraabar he
 This is the reason why it is becoming common for drugs to be sold online to be banned
 yachika main is baat par khaastaur se bataaya gaya he ki doctor ke nakli priskripshan ke madhyam se aisi dawaaon ko ghar baithe mangavaya ja saktaa he, jo jaan ke liye jokhim bharaa sabit ho saktaa he
 Apart from this, medicines which are being ordered from verified doctor's prescription can also be ordered from an online pharmacy using a letter head countless times
 drugs and cosmetic act 1940 or farmesi act 1948 ke tahat bhi dawaaon kii bikri online nahin kii ja sakati
 It has also been mentioned in the petition that some websites are also supplying banned medicines
 lekin sach puuchhie to online farmesi par najar rakhana or pratibandh ke aadesh ko puri tarah se lagu karana sarkaar ke liye bhi tedi kheer hi he
 During the hearing, the central government told the court that some committees have been formed, who are considering how safe it is to bring medicines sold on the internet to the people online
 haalanki centre sarkaar ne kaha ki 6 maheene kaa vakt chahie taaki is disha main thik tareeke se faisla kiya ja sake
 The court will now hold the next hearing in the case on 9 May

 ' a former CIA official said Islamabad should 'clean up' its army after the Mumbai attack accused David Headley revealed that the attackers had links with the Pakistani intelligence agency
 purv siie adhikari or vartmaan main pratishthit brookings institute main karyrat bruce ridel ne kaha ‘‘david hedli ke ikbaalia bayaan se hamen pataa chalaa ki mumbai hamale kii sajeesh lashkar e taiyaba ne rachi thi or iske alqaida tathaa shaayad pakistani sena se bhi kitne gahare sambandh hai
 Recently, top Indian officials said that during the interrogation of Headley, evidence has been found about isi's involvement in the Mumbai attacks
 is par ridel ne kaha ‘‘lashkar e taiyaba or iske agrani sanghathanon par pakistan sarkaar dwaara kadi karrwai na karne tathaa pakistani sena kii ‘safai’ na karne ke liye koi bahaanaa nahin he
 "he said" If Headley is right, then such a picture of the Pakistan Army emerges in which it is cooperating in terrorism and this raises startling questions about our most important ally and India's nuclear-rich neighbor
 ’ridel ne kaha ‘‘mumbai ke bare main sach or lashkar e taiyaba kaa bhavishya aisa time bam he jo mahatvapurn paak sambandhon ko prabhvit kar sakate hai or up mahadweep ke liye sankat utpann kar sakate hai
 Reidel said that Headley is a convicted conspirator and can mislead by lying, but his new charges are causing chaos in India
 pichley saptaah bhartiya press ko li hui soochna ke anusaar, bataaya jaataa he ki hedli ne poochtacha main bhartiya adhikariyon ko bataaya ki pakistani khufia agency ne das aatankiyon ko karachi se jalmaarg se bharat le jane vaali nauka ke liye bhugtan kiya tha or pakistani nausena ne unhen commando training di thi
 Ajmal Kasab, the only terrorist surviving out of the ten terrorists, also told Indian officials about training from the Navy during interrogation
 kasaab ko bharat main, bekasoor nagarikon kii hatya kaa doshi tehraaya ja chukaa he 
 India's Home Secretary GK Pillai said that the revelations made by Headley showed that the Pakistani intelligence agency was controlling and coordinating the incident from beginning to end
 videsh mantri hillari clinton ne kabul main kaha tha ki hedli ke khulaase main vah baaten hai jinke bare main america pakistan ko bataa chukaa he 
 Reidel said, "washington and New Delhi are awaiting Islamabad's response
" pakistan ke saath mumbai hamalon ke baad nilambit vaarta bharat ne behaal kar lee lekin iske bhavishya ke bare main vah anishchit he
 New Delhi had doubts about Pakistan's role in the Mumbai attacks from the beginning but nothing could be proved before Headley's statement

 He has demanded the resignation of Kejriwal and Sisodia in this case
 bijepi saansad manoj tiwari ne kaha ki ek artiai se pataa chalaa he ki skulon main kamaron ke nirmaan ke liye atirikt 2000 karod rupee die gaye the, jo keval 892 karod rupee main banaae ja sakate the
 The 34 contractors who were awarded tenders include their relatives
 dipti siem sisodiya par aarope lagaate hue manoj tiwari ne kaha ki kejariwal sarkaar kahati he ki usne shiksha main bada kaam kiya he lekin sach ye he ki inhone shiksha ke naam par 2000 karod rupee kaa ghotaalaa kiya he
 He has demanded Manish Sisodia to resign immediately on the matter

 After the statement of former French President Hollande on the Rafale case, Rahul Gandhi said that the former President of France has called our PM a thief
 
 Then what was the joke of the Prime Minister started being made on social media
 
 On social media my PM is a thief like a flood of jumlas
 
 It is as if there was a noise of a thief
 
 
 kendriya kanoon mantri ne to yahaan tak kah diya ki rahul gandhi besharm or gairjimmedaar hai
 
 
 Not only this, Prasad further said that it is our allegation that Rahul Gandhi's family did not get commission, hence the Rafale deal was done again in 2012
 rahul gandhi kaa parivaar bina kamishan kaam nahin karata chaahe wo boforce ho, 2ji ho yaa koyala ghotaalaa ho
 BJP is angry about why PM is being called a thief
 ravishankar prasad ko jawaab diya congress ke randeep surajevaala ne
 He said that the name of Modi government should be changed to Modi Baba Chalis Chor and Ravi Shankar Prasad is abusive of the allegations
 surajevaala ne kaha ki modi sarkaar pakistan kii aad main chup rahi he
 Tender opened in 2012, so how about 2008? There is a lot of leeway to hide a lie
 saath hi surajevaala ne sawaal uthaaya ki modi ambani ke piem hai yaa desh ke? But in Indian politics, calling the Prime Minister a thief is not new
 hamaare yahaan piem ko chor bolne kaa ek gairavshaalee itihaas rahaa he
 In 2013, then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was called a thief
 upie sarkaar ke samay piem chor he hesh tag khub chalaa
 On behalf of the BJP IT cell, it was tweeted that tomorrow the whole country will know that our PM is a thief
 bhaajapa netaa minakshi lekhi ne likhaa tha ki piem chor he, nahin yah sarkaar choron kii baraat he, bhashtra, helpalace, papet piem
 
 
 Now let's go a little further
 
 When the case of Bofors came up during Rajiv Gandhi, the opposition slogan was that there is noise in the street, Rajiv Gandhi is a thief
 magar ab jab halaat palat rahe hai to ravishankar prasad ko yahi naaraa nagavar lag rahaa he
 The biggest question is why the issues are not being discussed
 yadi aarope lag rahaa he to sarkaar un sabhi dastavejon ko saarvajanik kyon nahin karti
 Why doesn't the government say that it is ready to bring a white paper on Rafael
 yahi to sanshay kii sthiti paidaa hoti he, kya kuch chupaaya ja rahaa he? rahi sahi kasar france ke purv raashtrapati oland ke bayaan ne puri kar di he
 The comments halaat ye ho gaye hai ki ek party press conference karti he, kuch iljaam lagaati he, doosraa ghante bhar ke bheetar nayaa aarope lekar aa jaataa he
 
 
 In this era of Kajal's closet in Indian politics, everyone is sootting each other and trying to prove a thief
 
 But the question will still remain the same, when it is being repeatedly asked by the French government or Dassault Company that they were talking to Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, how did the deal go to a private company, which any There is no experience of making such weapons

 The Union Law Minister has even said that Rahul Gandhi is shameless and irresponsible
 
 
 yahi nahin prasad ne aage kaha ki hamaara aarope he ki rahul gandhi ke parivaar ko kamishan nahin mila isliye rafel deal ko dubaara 2012 main kiya gaya
 Rahul Gandhi's family does not work without commission whether it is Bofors, 2G or coal scam
 bijepi ko is baat kaa gussa he ki piem ko chor kyon bataaya ja rahaa he
 Randeep Surjewala of Congress responded to Ravi Shankar Prasad
 unhone kaha ki modi sarkaar kaa naam badalakar modi baba chalis chor rakh dena chahie or ravishankar prasad aaropon kaa jawaab gaali se de rahe hai
 Surjewala said that the Modi government is hiding under the cover of Pakistan
 tender hi 2012 main khulaa to 2008 kii baat kaise? ek jhooth chhipaane ke liye bahut chhot bolne padate hai
 Also Surjewala raised the question whether Modi is Ambani's PM or the country? magar bhartiya raajnneeti main pradhanmantri ko chor kahana koi nai baat nahin he
 We have a terrible history of calling PM a thief
 saal 2013 main tab ke pradhanmantri manmohan singh ko chor bolaa gaya
 During the UPA government, PM Chor Hai hash tag ran a lot
 bijepi iti cell kii taraf se twit kiya gaya ki kal puraa desh jaan jayega ki hamaara piem chor he
 BJP leader Meenakshi Lekhi had written that PM is a thief, no this government is a procession of thieves, bhashtra, helpless, puppet PM
 
 
 ab thode or peeche chalate hai
 
 rajeev gandhi ke samay jab boforce kaa maamla aayaa tha tab vipaksh ne naaraa diya tha ki gali-gali main shor he, rajeev gandhi chor he
 But now when the situation is changing, Ravi Shankar Prasad is feeling the same slogan
 sabase bada sawaal he ki muddon par baat kyon nahin ho rahi he
 If the allegations are being made then why does the government not make all those documents public
 sarkaar kyon nahin kahati ki wo rafel par shwet patr laane ke liye taiyaar he
 This is where a situation of suspicion arises, is anything being hidden? The statement of former President of France Hollande has done the right thing
 tippaniyan Things have become such that one party holds a press conference, charges something, another comes up with an allegation within an hour
 
 
 bhartiya raajnneeti ke is kaajal kii kothri ke yug main sab ek-duusare ko kaalikh pot rahe hai or chor sabit karne par tule hai
 
 magar sawaal phir bhi vahi rahegaa ki jab france sarkaar yaa desalt company kii taraf se yah baar-baar kaha ja rahaa he ki unki baat to hindustan eronotics limited se ho rahi thi, aakhir ye sauda ek nijee company ko kaise chalaa gaya, jise kisi bhi tarah ke hathiyaar banane kaa koi anubhav nahin he

 Why is there so much disrespect for our own heritage as a nation? Protection of India's heritage under colonial rule has been dependent on the law to punish those who harm them

 This law should have given certain benefits to the people coming in the heritage area as they were not allowed to construct their property on their own, whereas people living outside the heritage area can develop their property as per their wish

 In 2010, Parliament enacted a National Monuments Authority law to make local area plans for the purpose of improving protected areas, for the purpose of improving protected areas

 These projects prove more damaging than the private houses built 100 meters from the monument

 Such conservation efforts will also boost tourism in the area and will also earn the government's income

 This will be good not only for our past, but also our future

 a bench of Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi and Justice Deepak Gupta gave the CBI 2 weeks to report the status of the investigation in the case
 peeth congress netaa vishwanath chaturvedi kii us yachika par sunwaayee kar rahi thi, jisamen sibiai ko maamle kii jaanch kii sthiti adaalat ko bataane ke liye nirdesh dene kaa anurodh kiya gaya
 Significantly, Chaturvedi filed a petition in 2005 urging the apex court to direct the trial of Mulayam Singh Yadav, Akhilesh Yadav, his wife Dimple Yadav and Prateek Yadav under the Prevention of Corruption Act
 sheersh adaalat ne ek march 2007 ko apane faisle main sibiai ko aaropon kii jaanch karne tathaa yah pataa lagane kaa nirdesh diya tha ki sapa netaaon kii aay se adhik sampatti se sambandhit yachika sahi he yaa nahin
 In 2012, the court dismissed the reconsideration petitions of Mulayam and his sons against the verdict and directed the CBI to proceed with the investigation of the case
 nyaayalay ne sibiai ko jaanch kaa aadesh diya tha, jiske khilaaf in sabhi ne punarvichaar yachika daayar kii thi, haalanki nyaayalay ne dimple yadav kii yachika manjuur kar lee thi or sibiai ko unke khilaaf jaanch rokane ko kaha tha
 The court said that he did not hold any public office
 adaalat ne ek march 2007 ke apane aadesh main sanshodhan kar sibiai se sarkaar ke saamne nahin balki adaalat ke saamne sthiti report pesh karne ko kaha tha
 In his new petition, Chaturvedi said that there was a long gap between the filing of the complaint, the direction of the court and indecision in the filing of a regular case in this regard and for 11 years an unusual long time has passed without any action in the matter
 niyamit maamla darj karne ke liye yah vishay ab bhi sibiai ke saamne lambit he
 The petition said that so far no FIR has been filed against mulayam-akhilesh and this not only caused irreparable damage to the entire case but also raised serious questions on the credibility and honesty of our investigating agencies
 is yachika main kaha gaya ki sibiai kanoon ke anusaar niyamit maamla darj karne tathaa kshetradhikaar vaale magistrate ko praathmiki kii report dene ke liye baadhya he
 In the context of the previous CBI status report, the new petition filed said that it indicated that not only Mulayam, Akhilesh and Prateek but Dimple also earned disproportionate assets

 This will provide an opportunity to get acquainted with each other, increase regional and cultural coordination and the state economy will also be dynamic
 'mukhyamantri ne kaha ki bahut armaan se yah yojana prarambh kii gai he aurais varsh 20 se 25 hajaar bujurgon koiske tahat labhanvit karne kaa lakshya rakhaa gaya he

 One who realizes that social media does not matter much is in great misconception about it
 ek samay aisa bhi tha, jab print media hamaare samaaj kii soch ko gaharaai tak prabhavit karata tha
 Then came the era of television and then it became an important medium for the expression of our social, economic and political views
 pehle print media tay karata tha ki electronic media ko kaise kaam karnaa chahie, lekin jaldi hi iskaa ulataa hone laga
 Now the TV debate has started making headlines in newspapers and newspapers are read only to cut the journey in trains or planes
 lekin iske baavjood likhit shabdon kii takat hameshaa bani rahegi
 Social media has changed drastically
 subah soshal media par jo vishay hote hai, shaam ko vahi tivi channelon par charchaa kaa mukhya mudda ban jate hai

 All this was done in the name of 'agni Pariksha' from the girl

 The girl alleged that Rahul used to molest her
 ladkike mutabik uski sagaai kahin or ho jane ke baad bhi rahul ne apana bartaav nahin badla
 It has been said that Rahul and Suman seem to be half-warts of the girl in the relationship

 The bill will not be applicable in the northeast areas
 Outside the tribal and permit areas bill, the government is coming to Parliament with the Citizenship Amendment bill, which is strongly opposed by many opposition parties
 cabinet ne buudhvaar ko is bill ko manjuuri di he or ab iske sansad main paarit hone kaa intjaar he
 According to the information, Nagaland and Mizoram along with the Inner Line Permit areas of Arunachal Pradesh have been kept out of the purview of this bill
 naagarikta sanshodhan bill se purvottar ke vah ilaake bhi baahar rakhe gaye hai jo chhathi anusuchee kaa hissaa hai
 These provisions were not initially part of the bill, these have been incorporated later

 There is a lot of anger in the northeastern states about this bill and there are demonstrations against it continuously

 Opposition, minority organizations and others have attacked the Muslims for not including Muslims in the heavy opposition in the Northeast
 unhone is tark par bhi is vidheyak kaa virodh kiya ki yah samvidhan ke khilaaf he, kyonki samvidhan dharm ke aadhaar par kisi naagarik se bhedbhaav nahin karata he
 The bill is seen as an attempt to change the definition of illegal migrants

 This amendment to the Citizenship Act is also being described as a violation of the Assam Accord of 1985, in which there was talk of deporting citizens of all religions who came from Bangladesh after 1971

 vahiin, duusari ore apane idial partner se milane se pehle purushon ke aath afaire or 6 van-nite stand hote hai
 The special thing is that this figure of men's affair and one-night stand is gradually decreasing
 ji haa, ek duusare adhyayan ke mutabik purush pehle kii tulana main ab commit karne main jyada nahin ghabaraate hai
 Not only this, now they want to settle down at an early age

 According to the survey, on average, a young man wants to be committed right from the age of 22, whereas 10 years ago this age was 24 years
 har 4 main se 1 single purush ne bataaya ki vah kamitid hona chahta he taaki vah apana parivaar shuru kar sake, jabaki har paanchaven bachaler ko is baat kii chintaa tha ki unke doston kii shaadi hone par ve akele pad jaaenge
 But men date 8 times to different women before settling down
 ve 3 baar blind date par bhi jate hai
 Apart from this, they meet 3 girls on the internet
 mahilaon or purushon main sabase zyada antar sexual parteners ko lekar he
 According to the survey, women have 7 sexual partners in their lives and 10 men

 The family of BSF head constable Sushil Kumar (47) was weeping under his martyrdom
 sargical stike ke baad se lagaataar pakistan kii ore se kiye ja rahe sijafire ulanghan main desh ke is vir sainik kii maut ho gai
 The family, which had to make preparations to celebrate Diwali, is celebrating mourning today after losing its support
 dukh kii is ghadi main parivaar kaa dard baantne ke liye pooraaharyanaumad padaa
 Children, elderly, women and even the body of Sushil Kumar, the body of the BSF jawans who carried his ancestral city, were also in tears
 baavjood iske logon main pakistan ke khilaaf jabardast gussa tha
 While the slogans of Susheel Zindabad were echoing, the slogans of Pakistan Murdabad were also raised
 ye kram shahid susheel kumaar kii antim vidaai yani anteshti tak jari rahaa
 Hundreds of people bid farewell to Sushil Kumar with moist eyes
 pakistan kii napak harakatein aaye din kai gharon ke chiraag buja rahi he
 But look at the spirit, angry with the martyrdom of one of his companions, Sushil told his wife that duty is more dear to him than festival
 diwaali to vah aae din sarhad par manaate he
 The story of the martyr head constable does not end here
 desh kii raksha ke liye apni jaan kurbaan karne vaale is jaanbaaj sipaahi kaa sapana tha ki uskaa betaa bada hokar sena kaa bada adhikari bane or desh kii raksha kare
 Martyr Head Constable Sushil Kumar was employed in BSF for the last 24 years
 lagbhag dedh saal pehle unka tabadalaa chhattisgarh se jammu ke ares pura sector main hua tha
 He was shot on Monday morning, after which he died
 unki shahadat se ek ore jahaan parivaar ko gaharaa sadma laga he vahiin unki maut par fakhr bhi he
 He is survived by his wife and two children
 ghar main unki bujurg maa bhi hai
 West Indies star spinner Sunil Narine said that there is no such ball as the third and it is just like playing a mind game with the batsmen of the opposing team
 mana jaataa he ki of spinners ke nae charchit hathiyaar doosraa ke baad pakistani spinner said ajmal ne ek or gend teesraa bhi ijad kar lee he
 Narayan was asked if there was a possibility of a third, apart from the traditional off break and the second, he replied flatly
 unhone isisi vishwa tii20 championships ke dauraan patrakaron se kaha, yah shaayad ballebaajon ke saath mindgem khelnaa he
 The batsmen are doing a lot these days as the game is progressing with them
 gendbaajon ke paas karne ke liye zyada kuch nahin he, isliye ve keval mindgem khel sakate hai
 No ball is surprising, Narayan said that the trend in T20 is changing and it is a difficult challenge for the bowlers
 unhone kaha, gendbaaj hameshaa kuch nayaa karne kii koshish kar rahe hai lekin aapako ho saktaa he ki pataa nahin ho abhi kya ho saktaa he or kya kargar nahin hoga
 The Caribbean bowler was asked, Is there a shocking ball, his direct answer was, 'no
 chaunkaane vaali koi gend nahin hoti
 i try to keep it as simple as possible
 main pichley do yaa teen saal se jo kar rahaa hum, vahi ab bhi karuunga
 ' bade parde par 27 saalon kaa lanbaa safar, is dauraan dheron superhit filmein, lekin ab lagata he ki bollywood ke 'baazeegar' kaa jaadu janata par asar nahin kar rahaa he
 Taking the last 6 movies of King of Romance, 5 of them have flopped badly at the box office
 chintaa kii baat ye bhi he ki jiro, jab harry met sejal, rais or fain jaisi filmein jinamein se kuch par thik-thaak bajet kharch kiya gaya tha ve filmein bhi box offis par munh ke bal giriin
 Such gossips have started on social media for a long time now that the stardom of superstars is over
 jiro shahrukh kii lagaataar teesri flop thi or iske baad shahrukh ne pehali baar kuch aisa kiya jo vah aam taur par nahin karte hai
 Shahrukh, who lives a very busy life, took a break from work and went on vacation with his entire family
 rajeev masand ke saath ek intervyuu main shahrukh ne kaha tha ki unhone kuch sochaa nahin bas nikal gaye
 So is Shahrukh's stardom really getting molded now? Have people really fallen in love with Shahrukh, who teaches 'love' to people? Is that the time when Shahrukh should not stand in front of the camera but behind the camera? These days, for Shahrukh, who is handling the production of films and web series, what can be those things that can give him tremendous popularity once again on the screen
 chaliye jaanate hai?1
 Content-based films Karan Shah Rukh Khan's last few films, he likes to play larger than life characters
 haalanki jiro main unhone meerut ke ek kam padhe likhe dilaphenk ladke kaa li se hatakar kirdaar jarur kiya tha, lekin baaki filmon main vah khud ko superstar project karnaa pasand karte hai
 If Shahrukh picks up movies with strong content, then maybe it can become a thing
 nayaa jamaana content kaa he or vahi filmein parde par hit ho rahi hai jinke content main jaan he
 2
 abhinay kii jaaduugari dikheshahrukh pichley kaaphi vakt se kaam kar rahe hai or unke abhinay main jaan hoti he isamen koi andeh nahin he
 However, in his last few films, no character was shown who left his mark on the minds of the audience
 shahrukh ke paas khud kaa production house he or jaahir he unke har roj dheron script aati hai
 Shahrukh now needs to pick up scripts that are out of the box in this era
 3
 Working on more than one medium, the web series Bard of Blood, which is being produced in Shahrukh's production, is very much in discussion these days
 siries main imran hashmi lead role main hai or is siries main shahrukh najar nahin aaenge
 Shahrukh appears only on the big screen and this is also a big problem
 salmaan khan, aamir khan, shahrukh or amitabh bachchan jaise sitare jahaan chote parde par aakar bhi darshakon se conect kar rahe hai vahiin shahrukh sirf bade parde par dikhte hai
 Although Shah Rukh has brought a couple of shows for TV in between, he has not been an effective show like Amitabh Aamir and Salman's shows (KBC, Satyamev Jayate and Bigg Boss)
 4
 Need to work on social image: The thing that has most impressed Shahrukh's stardom is his negative image
 pichley kuch saalon main aise tamaam ghatnakram hue hai jinase shahrukh kii chhavi ek had tak prabhavit hui
 The problem is that Shah Rukh did not do much to heal his image
 jabaki salmaan ne lagaataar kaam karte rahe hai
 Salman and Aamir have acquired a different image among the fans
 5
 Doing biopic and real life based films is now the time for biopic and real life cinema
 aisi filmein box offis par hit ho rahi hai jo yaa to satya ghatana par aadhaarit hai yaa kisi kii byopic hai
 Shah Rukh Khan had said no to Rakesh Sharma's biopic film in the past
 jabaki unhen akshay kumaar kii tarah hi aisi filmon par kaam karne kii jarurat he
 From such films where the audience is directly connected but also reach theaters to see such films
 udaipur ke zoological park main aajkal ek nayaa celebrity charchaa main he
 This is the white tiger 'rama', brought from Chennai to Rajasthan under the exchange program
 is baagh kii khaasiyat yah he ki yah sirf tamil samajhataa he
 Now it is trying to develop an understanding of Hindi and Rajasthani as well
 safed baagh rama ko chennai ke vandalur zu se rajasthan ke udaipur shahar ke sajjangadh zoological park laayaa gaya he
 In lieu of this white tiger, Tamil Nadu has been added to wolves
 rama ko jab udaipur laayaa gaya to pataa chalaa ki yah na to hindi samajhataa he na hi rajasthani
 The problem was that it obeyed them only when orders were received in Tamil
 tippaniyan Ram Singh, who is responsible for the care of five-year-old Rama in Udaipur, was challenged to handle the 'tamil-speaking' tiger
 rama paidaa bhale hi dilli main hua, or ab udaipur main he, lekin uski parvarish to chennai main hi hui he, or isliye swaabhaavik rup se uski bhashaa tamil he
 Eventually, Chelliah was summoned from Chennai, who raised Rama
 chelaiya ne udaipur pahunchane ke baad rama ko tamil main jo bhi kaha, usne uskaa paalan kiya
 But Chelliah cannot live here forever
 is samasya ko sulajhane ke liye unhone rama ke nae care tekar ram singh ko kuch tamil sikhaai
 In 21 days, Rama has changed into a new environment
 ab vah ram singh kii uttar bhartiya tamil kuch samajhane laga he
 Ram Singh says that "it does not know Hindi language
 isko tamil bhashaa main samajhaana padataa tha
 Like 'sapdahiya' means eating food, 'po' means going out, 'and' means coming in
 
 
 ab yah friendli ho gaya he
 Some Hindi is also understood like Rama
 
 Rama
 
 If you speak, it comes
 " It seems that Rama will soon overcome the obstacle which many people of North and South are not willing to overcome
 use hindi or tamil donon samaj aane lagengi
 Looks like Udaipur transfer from Chennai will give Rama a lot of fame
 use dekhne ke liye kaaphi bheed jute rahi he
 Apart from Rama, Rajasthan currently has only one more white tiger which is in Jaipur
 safed baagh rama ko chennai ke vandalur zu se rajasthan ke udaipur shahar ke sajjangadh zoological park laayaa gaya he

 udaipur main paanch saal ke rama kii dekhbhaal kii jimmedaari sambhaal rahe ram singh ke liye 'tamil bhashi' baagh ko sanbhaalanaa chunauteepurn tha
 Rama may have been born in Delhi, and is now in Udaipur, but he was raised in Chennai, and so naturally his language is Tamil
 aakhirkaar chennai se chelaiya ko bulaayaa gaya, jinhone rama kii parvarish kii he
 Chellaiah followed Rama to whatever he said in Tamil after reaching Udaipur
 lekin chelaiya yahaan hameshaa to rah nahin sakate
 To solve this problem, he taught Ram, the new caretaker of Rama, some Tamil
 21 din main rama nae maahaul main dhal gaya he
 Now he has started to understand something of Ram Singh's North Indian Tamil
 ram singh kaa kahana he ki "isko hindi bhashaa nahin aati
 It had to be explained in Tamil language
 jaise 'sapadahia' matlab khaanaa khaanaa, 'po' matlab baahar janaa, 'va' matlab andar aana
 
 
 Now it has become friendly
 kuch hindi bhi samajhane laga he jaise rama
 
 rama
 
 bolenge to aa jaataa he
 " lagata he rama ne jald hi vah baadha dur kar legaa jo uttar or dakshin ke kai log dur karne ko taiyaar nahin hai
 She will begin to understand both Hindi and Tamil
 lagata he chennai se udaipur transfar rama ko kaaphi shoharat degaa
 a large crowd is gathering to see him
 rama ke alaava philhal rajasthan ke paas sirf ek or safed baagh he jo ki jaipur main he
 It seems that Rama will soon overcome the obstacle which many people of North and South are not willing to overcome
 use hindi or tamil donon samaj aane lagengi
 Looks like Udaipur transfer from Chennai will give Rama a lot of fame
 use dekhne ke liye kaaphi bheed jute rahi he

 pakistan ke 66 saal ke itihaas main kisi loktantric nirvaachit sarkaar ne pehali baar paanch saal puure kiye hai
 This is an even greater achievement because of the serious problems of law and order, poor economic conditions, and even more so in the thoughtful madness of Chief Justice Iftikhar Ali Chaudhary who punishes senior leaders of the Pakistan People's Party (PPP) But it takes off ab yah kaaphi had tak tay he ki agar achaanak koi haroonges ghatana na hui to sansad ke liye aglaa chunaav 11 may, 2013 ko hoga
 But is Pakistan ready for these elections? a new Election Commission has been formed and voter lists are ready for the first time since 1970, but issues like law, order and booth occupancy are yet to be tried
 ab tak ke anumaanon ke anusaar yah lagbhag tay he ki desh kii bagdor gathbandhan sarkaar ke haath main hogi
 The two largest parties - the PPP and the Muslim League (nawaz), seem fully prepared and if the traditional belief is correct that most voters will vote as before, then Nawaz Sharif's party in Punjab has the upper hand
 uttar or madhya punjab main pipipi kii haalat buree ho sakati he, lekin dakshin main use phayda mil saktaa he or sindh ke apane paaramparik garh par uskaa kabja barkaraar rahegaa
 If Imran Khan's tehreek-e-insaf party got between 30 and 50 seats, Nawaz would suffer
 uthal-puthal bhare pashchimottar seemaa praant kii siten to noton kii theliyon se milengi
 Yet the most important issue is whether this election will establish a stable and sustainable democracy in Pakistan or this path is full of uncertainties
 kya ek or nirvaachit sarkaar apana kaarykaal puraa karegi? kya dharmik kattarpanthi takatein athwa sena use kaamyaab hone dengi? ham to bhale kii hi kaamana karte hai, par is yuva desh ke itihaas ko dekhte hue yah sawaal uthaanaa lajimi he
 On 11 August 1947, quaid-azam declared Pakistan a secular country
 ‘‘aap aaazaad hai, apane mandiron main jane ke liye aaazaad hai
 
 
 Are free to visit their mosques
 
 
 vakt ke saath-saath hindu-hindu nahin rahenge or musalmaan nahin rahenge
 
 
 His political status will be that of a citizen of the country
 ’’ unhone ek aadhunik islamic, par dharmanirpeksh or loktantric raashtra kii kaamana kii thi, kyonki unki najar main jab musalamaanon ko apana desh mil gaya to rashtravaadi sampradayikta kii sari vajahen mar gai thim
 But the sad thing is that instead of Jinnah's dream, victory was won by Maulana Maududi's Islamic ideology
 isamen sara jor islamic hukumat kaa ekadhikaar kaayam karne par tha, jisaki jhalak 1951 main paarit uddeshy prastaav main dekhne ko mili, jisamen pakistan islamic ganraajya ghoshit kar diya gaya
 It is the first Muslim country to have a religious identity in its name
 pakistan kii sabhi sarkaron main ek baat samaan rahi he
 She has been continuously feeding the people with the fear of Hindu India
 general ayub khan se lekar har raashtrapati ne is aag main ghi daalaa he
 It is a well-thought-out and constant trick, which aims to convince the people of the power of the government and the legitimacy of taking help of both foreign money and weapons
 isaki shuruyaat vajeer-e-ajam liyakat ali ne kii thi, jab ve dosti kaa haath maangane 1951 main pehali baar america gaye the
 Yahiya Khan, Bhutto, Zia and then all the leaders continued this trend
 lekin desh ke vajood ke liye islam kii jarurat kaa mukhauta or bharat ke liye paala gaya khauf pakistan ke vaaste behad khatarnaak sabit hua he
 This not only strengthened the Islamic fundamentalist forces, but also strengthened the army
 kisi bhi nai sarkaar ko pichley 60 saal se thopi gai, is chunauti kaa saamana karnaa padegaa
 If the next government has to complete its five-year term, then it will have to deepen the roots of democracy
 phir sena kii haisiyat kya rah jaaegi? kya pakistani fouj apni belgaum takat ko chhodie or chhavniyon main chupchaap baithne ke liye digaami taur par taiyaar he? pakistan main fouj sabase bada or sabase taqatvar kaarobaari gut he
 He owns most of the businesses and very large land, which has been gifted to his karkoons from time to time
 agar arthvyavastha par or sankat aayaa to kya sena dakhal nahin degi?pakistan par najar rakhane vaale kuch logon kaa daawa he ki kisi pukhta vajah ke bina satta kaa takhta palatnaa mushkil he
 i think the collapsing economy and the deteriorating condition of law and order can once again be sufficient reasons for these unworthy civilians to intervene
 ummid he ki pakistan tamaam mushkilon ke baavjood loktantr ke saath muhabbat kaa yah silsilaa jari rakhega

 This year everytime i looked at you i have been constantly overwhelmed because the thoughts coming back to me are 'be wise, be humble, be calm, be kind, be strong because there's a power inside you and you have to spend it, share it , spread it 'I will walk the path of my soul, change my destiny, make my karma
 Grateful beyond words to gannu and the universe for this life, for the opportunity to be truly alive and align myself to the higher purpose
 Gannu i am one with you and will continue to walk on your path

 "when Yusuf, who started his ODI career in 2008 against Pakistan, was asked about the statement of all rounder Shahid Afridi, in which this Pakistan player said that all the teams 'tamper' with the ball, Yusuf insisted
 "I don't know why he made such a statement
" main is par kuch nahin kah saktaa kyonki maine aaj tak kisi ko aisa (gend ko daant se katate) karte hue nahin dekha he
 He said, "many people have reacted to this, but i have not seen any such thing at the international level so far

 The government should formulate a framework to eliminate debt liabilities on the company in a short period of time after realistically assessing the income generating potential of the company

 After this, many users tweeted on Twitter with 'digvijay for CM' hashtag, in which Digvijay is being described as the most capable leader for the post of CM
 soshal media par koi unhen sachcha hindu to koi vishaal hriday or drudh nishchay vaala netaa bataa rahaa he
 After all these statements, on Tuesday, Digvijay Singh has tweeted and told himself out of the race of cm's chair
 haalanki isse pehle bhi jabakmalnathko pradesh adhyaksh kii kaman saunpi gai thi, tab bhi digvijay ne kaha tha ki wo siem kii res se baahar hai or party ko jeet dilaane ke liye ekajute hokar kaam karenge
 Even after being ousted from the power of Madhya Pradesh in 2003, Digvijay announced his retirement from the state's politics for 10 years
 apane baat ko majbootee se lagu karte hue wo ek dashak tak dilli kii raajnneeti main to sakriy rahe lekin madhya pradesh kii siyasat se koi vaasta nahin rakhaa

 Police of every city and state often drill mock to deal with terrorist incidents
 desh main badhati aatanki ghatnaon ko dekhte hue yah jaruri bhi he, lekin aatank ko kisi dharm se jodna khokhli soch hi dikhaati he
 This hollow thinking was introduced by the police there during mock drills in Surat and Narmada of Gujarat
 darasal yahaan mock drill main aatankiyon kii bhoomika nibhaane waalon ko muslim dikhaaya gaya tha
 They were put on Muslim hats and slogans of Islam would be kept alive, Kashmir would live, Narmada would carry
 is tarah kii harakat se saaf ho gaya ki police surat or narmada police muslimon ko kis nazariye se dekhati he
 Religious organizations are outraged over the terrorists being shown Muslim in the mock drill and the opposition Congress has sought a response from the government
 espi ne bhi galati maani he or kaha he ki doshiyon ko sajaa di jaaegi
 Questions are arising whether the Gujarat Police also believes that Muslims are terrorists, if not then why the terrorists were shown as Muslims and why the slogans of Islam Zindabad were raised
 aisa bhi nahin he ki police ne sirf ek baar aisa kiya ho
 The Narmada district police linked Islam to terrorism in a mock drill, the same way Surat police also linked religion to terrorism
 narmada main islam jindabad ke naare lagavaaye gaye the or surat main pulisavaalon ke sir par islamic topi saj gai
 The Surat police, however, admitted the mistake
 maamle kii jaanch ke aadesh bhi de die hai, lekin sawaal ye he ki kya ye chote police afasaron kii galati thi yaa is maamle main bade afasaron kii koi jimmedaari banati he
 Top police officials are saying that this act is of junior policemen, they have nothing to do with it
 ho saktaa he chand junior police afasaron par karrwai kii gaaj bhi gira di jaae, lekin kya bade adhikariyon kii koi bhoomika nahin banati
