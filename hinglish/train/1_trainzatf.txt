 Also, from past experiences, the government has assessed the seriousness of Mamata's threats

 The news is also coming that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh can talk to him to convince Mamta

 bhagwaan ne raja kii seva itani shraddha ke saath kii ki raja prasann ho gaya or usne apane gale kaa haar unke gale main daal diya
 With his Maya power, God put that necklace in San Ji's neck and he did not even know
 baad main jab san ji ko hosh aayaa to wo darate-darate mahal main gaye
 He felt that the king would scold him a lot for not arriving on time
 san ji ko dekhakar raja ne kaha, 'ab aap phir kyon aae hai? ham aapaki seva se bahut khush hue
 Want anything else? raja kii baat sunakar san ji bole, 'mujhe kshamaa kar dijie
 Kirtan was going on all night, so i could not come in time

 The king said, 'hey you came
 aapaki seva se prasann hokar maine aapako haar diya tha or wo abhi aapke gale main bhi he
 Comments san haar dekhakar chaunk gaye
 He realized that God had come in his form
 unhone raja se kaha, 'maharaj, yah sach he ki main nahin aayaa tha
 God came to my place
 aapane ye maala bhagwaan ko di thi or unhone use mere gale main daal diya
 ' san ji kii baaten sunakar raja unke charnon main natmastak ho gaya or kehane laga ki ab aap ko kuch karne kii jarurat nahin he
 Now you just indulge in Bhagavad bhakti

 'bajrangi bhaijan' kaa nirdesan kiya he, kabir khan ne jo salmaan ke saath isse pehle 'ek tha tiger' jaisi block baster bana chuke hai
 The story of the film revolves around a Pakistani girl, who stays away from her mother and stays in Hindustan and the girl meets Pawan Kumar Chaturvedi, ie Salman
 salmaan is bacchee ko waapas pakistan pahunchane kaa zimmaa uthaate hai
 You will have to watch the film to know what happens in this journey of going from Hindustan to Pakistan
 baat khaamiyon or khoobiyon kii
 The story is very simple and you will guess the outcome yourself
 film kaa pehla bhaag mujhe kamjor laga
 The story progresses slowly and in the meantime you may get confused to understand it
 film main aapako na to 'wonted' ke salmaan dikhenge na hi 'dabang' yaa 'kik' vaale salmaan kii jhalak dikhegi
 There will be light entertainment in the film
 dialog bhi itane asardaar nahin lage
 i found the script of the first part very weak
 baat khoobiyon kii karen to film duusare bhaag main kaaphi majbootee se parde par aati hai
 In the second part, entertainment is more and emotional scenes too
 navazuddin ke aate hi film main intertenment kaa tadakaa lag jaataa he
 The special thing is that director Kabir Khan has kept the theme of the film balanced in such a way that the feelings of the people of any country, whether Hindustan or Pakistan, are not hurt
 salmaan apane bhole-bhaale kirdaar main safal dikhe
 Harshali will win your heart as Shahida
 dharm or donon deshon kii soch par bhi badhiya tanz he
 Kareena's tenor is simple and easy
 film ke gane thik hai par 'selfi le le' or 'bhar de jholii' ke alaava koi or gaanaa aapaki jubaan par shaayad na tike
 The comments to kul milakar sidhi,saral film he 'bajrangi bhaijan', jo aapako hansaaegi bhi, par film main tark na dhundhen to behatar hoga
 The screenplay of the film is tight and it also has a good grip on direction
 darshakon main salmaan prem dekhte hue is film ko shaayad 3
 5 stars can be given, but as a critic, 3 stars to the film from my side
 film kii kahani ek pakistani bacchee ke ird-gird gumti he, jo apni maa se bichhadakar hindustan main rah jaati he or is bacchee kii mulaakaat hoti he pawan kumaar chaturvedi yani salmaan se
 Salman takes the responsibility of taking this girl back to Pakistan
 hindustan se pakistan jane ke is safar main kya-kya hota he, kaise-kaise mode aate hai, yah jaanane ke liye aapako film dekhni padegi
 Talk of flaws and merits
 kahani badi sidhi-si he or anjaam kaa andaaza aap khud laga lenge
 The first half of the film made me feel weak
 kahani aahista-aahista aage badhati he or is bich aapako ise samajhane main uljhan pesh aa sakati he
 In the film, neither you will see Salman of 'wanted' nor will you see a glimpse of Salman with 'dabangg' or 'kick'
 film main halkaa-phulka manoranjan chalata rahegaa
 Dialogue also did not look so effective
 pehle bhaag kii script mujhe bahut kamazor lagi
 Talking about the features, the film comes on screen very strongly in the second part
 duusare bhaag main intertenment bhi zyaada he or bhavuk seens bhi
 As soon as Nawazuddin arrives, there is a temper of entertainment in the film
 khaas baat yah he ki nirdeshak kabir khan ne film ke vishay ko is tarah santulit rakhaa he ki hindustan ho yaa pakistan kisi bhi desh ke logon kii bhaawanaaon ko thes na pahunche
 Salman was successful in his naïve character
 shahida ke kirdaar main harshali aapkaa dil jeet lengi
 There is also a lot of tension on religion and the thinking of both the countries
 karina kaa qirdaar sada or sahaj he
 The songs of the film are fine, but apart from 'selfie le le' and 'bhar de jholi', no other song can stand on your tongue
 tippaniyan Overall, the straightforward, simple film 'bajrangi Bhaijaan', which will make you laugh, but if you do not find logic in the film, it would be better
 film kaa screenple ksaa hua he or nirdesan par bhi acchhee pakad he
 Seeing Salman Prem in the audience, this film was probably 3
 5 star die ja sakate hai par bataur sameekshak meri ore se film ko 3 stars

 payalat ne iject ko safalataa purvak kiya he
 There is no information of any kind of loss

 The pilot is ejectively safe
 vayusena ne court of inquairi ke aadesh die hai
 It is worth mentioning that the Fire Powerdemonstration of the Indian Air Force is proposed on 16 February
 uskaa phul dress reharsal 14 farvari ko yojit hona he
 The aircraft was on its training mission in the same context
 mumbai se 30 kimi dur thane ke panchapakhadi kshetra main rashtravaadi congress party (ensipi) kaa sthaneey karyaalay air india ke hadataali payalton kaa apratyaashit mukhyalay ban gaya he
 Outside it and in the verandah are many cages filled with beautiful birds
 thane se vidhayak 47 saal ke jitendra avahad kaa kahana he ki unhen in pakshiyon se pyaar he or vishesh rup se unka chahchahana bahut pasand he
 These birds get good food, but they are locked in Avhad cages
 ve kabhi nahin ud sakenge
 Awhad has also caged the national airline as president of the striking Union Indian Pilots Guild (IPG), representing the pilots of Air India before the merger
 isse pehle bhootpurv indian airlines (aaie) ke payalton ne indian commercial payalts association (isipie) ke netritv main sitambar, 2009 or april-may 2011 main do baar badi hadtaal kii
 These three strikes stalled flights for a total of one month, giving the airlines Rs 500 crore
 se adhik kaa chuunaa laga
 International flights of Air India are at a standstill
 iske hajaaron yatri or chhuttiyaan manaane vaale log pareshaan hai
 These airlines, which are generously spending taxpayers' money, will not be able to fly high as long as it remains in the clutches of its unions
 ye unionen apane sadasyon ko baar-baar bina anumati ke anupasthit rahane ke liye uksaati hai
 This time 341 out of total 450 pilots of Air India reported being ill
 ye sabhi 'biimaar' payalat ipiji ke sadsy hai
 The strike cost Air India Rs 30,000 crore over a period of 10 years
 kaa nayaa anudaan package dene kii ghoshnaa ke maheene bhar ke bheetar hi ho gai
 This airline gets Rs 12 crore every day after the strike started from 7 May
 kaa nuksaan uthaanaa pad rahaa he
 Its total loss already is Rs 22,000 crore
 or bakaayaa karj 46,000 karod ru
 Belongs to is gharelu airlines kii samasyaayein 2007 main air india or indian airlines ke vilay ke turant baad shuru ho gayi
 The rules regarding the pay and allowances and working of the pilots of the two airlines were different
 ipiji kaa maananaa he ki isaki pratispardhi union ne sarkaar ko ek samjhaute par majaboor karke apane liye malai nikaal lee
 In this agreement, every pilot gets Rs 1 lakh
 prati maah kii vetan vruddhi ke saath bowing 787 drimliner prashikshan ke liye barabari kaa mauka mila tha
 The ICPA claims that the government has retracted its pre-merger promise of increment for Indian Airlines pilots
 donon unionon ko shikaayat he ki payalton ko akasar samay par vetan nahin miltaa, kabhi-kabhi to chah maheene tak vetan nahin miltaa
 There has been a demand for equality in terms of salary, allowances and career progress
 lekin naagarik uddyan mantralay or air india prabandhan in muddon ko sulajhane main puri tarah se vifal rahe hai, jiske chalate ye unionen aape se baahar hai
 In April 2011, Justice D
K
 em
 a four-member committee was formed under the leadership of the Dharmadhikari to look into human resource (HR) issues arising out of the merger
 is samiti ne farvari, 2012 main report saunp di, lekin sarkaar ne abhi tak us par koi karrwai nahin kii he
 Civil Aviation Minister Ajit Singh says that the government is studying the recommendations of this committee and will take steps on them soon
 ve jor dekar kehete hai ki is bich payalton ko kaam par lautnaa hoga or uske baad hi sarkaar unase baat karegi
 They cannot hold government and travelers hostage like this
 ajit singh in samasyaon ke liye bina vichaare kiye gaye vilay ko jimmedaar bataate hai
 1,600 pilots of Air India get a total of Rs 800 crore every year
 vetan miltaa he
 Commander's salary is Rs 7 lakh
 prati maah tak he, jo nijee airlines ke payalton se 10 se 15 fisadi tak zyada he
 The number of its commanders is around 600, who also get a lot of allowances, including free travel, with all family members six times a year, anywhere in the country or abroad
 ritair hone ke baad bhi unhen ye vishesh suvidhaayen jari rahati hai
 Yet India's old labor laws, which are upheld by the court order, identify them as 'workers' and allow them to form unions
 unke shisht or mukhar rajaneta avahad payalat nahin hai or is hadtaal main unka ku chha bhi daanv par nahin he
 His only connection with airlines is that Ruta, his wife and niece of the late trade union leader Dutta Samant, has been an air hostess in Air India for 27 years
 ruta air india cabin kru association (eicisie) kii sadsy hai, jo rashtravaadi congress party (ensipi) main avahad ke sahyogi or mitra kiran pawaskar ke sangrakshan main chalati he
 Pavaskar is a member of the Legislative Council in the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly
 pawaskar ipiji ke netritv main hadtaal kaa puri tarah se samarthan karte hai
 He claims that the management does not pay heed to the pilots until they stop the flight
 ve pichley 15 varshon se ol india jet airways officers and staff association ke bhi adhyaksh hai
 Avhad says his pilot friends convinced him to become the president of their guild in 2006
 ve avahad ke rajnatik mitra or sangrakshak sharad pavaar or unheen ke dal ke sahyogi prafull patel kii vajah se banate prabhaav ko dekh rahe the
 Patel was the Minister of Civil Aviation at the time of the merger
 kai log atakalein lagaate hai ki avahad darasal patel ke jane ke baad ajit singh ko pareshaan karne kii koshish kar rahe hai
 The reasons cited for the strike of the pilots are very insignificant
 air india jald hi 20 karod dollar (1,000 karod ru
 ) To buy 27 new Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft
 prabandhan chahta he ki puraane air india or tatkaaleen indian airlines, donon ke payalat baraabar sankhya main is nae vimaan kii udaan bharne kaa prashikshan hasil karen
 The IPG wants only its members to train for the new aircraft, while the ICPA, representing the interests of all 900 pilots of the erstwhile Indian Airlines, is opposing it
 do drimliner may ke ant or do anya disambar tak aa jaaenge, lekin air india ke kisi payalat ko ab tak inaki udaan kaa prashikshan nahin mila he
 ICPA Secretary General Captain Harish Sriyan says that "air India pilots are behaving like children who think the Dreamliner is a toy that is just coming for them and they are not there to share it
" '' par avahad kaa maananaa he ki drimliner kaa mudda bahut gambhir he
 Awhad agrees that the merger of Air India and Indian Airlines failed to resolve industrial relations issues
 ve kehete hai, ''maanav sansaadhan nitiyon ko sangat banane kaa koi prayaas nahin kiya gaya he
 This allows the then Indian Airlines pilot to be promoted from first officer to commander in six years, irrespective of whether there is a vacancy or not

 The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which is dreaming of forming a government at the Center after the upcoming Lok Sabha elections, does not want to leave any stone unturned to win as many seats as possible in the most politically important Uttar Pradesh
 party uttar pradesh main apane maujuuda saansadon ke saath hi pichley loksabhaa chunaav main duusare sthaan par rahe pratyaashiyon ko phir chunaav maidan main utaaregi
 In the recent meeting of the Uttar Pradesh BJP unit's core committee, it was decided early that in the 2014 general elections, the party will give tickets to the sitting mps as well as the candidates who have performed well in various seats of the state but have missed out on the victory

 Along with this, 10 candidates who finished second should also be tried
 bhaajapa netaaon ke mutabik, jin siton par party ke ummidavaar pichley loksabhaa chunaav main duusare sthaan par the, yadi unhen phir mauka diya jaataa he to unhen is chunaav main apni-apni seat par satta virdohi lahar (anti inkambency) kaa puraa phayda milane kii ummid he
 The party believes that among the 10 seats it won, there were strong and strong candidates like Rajnath Singh, Maneka Gandhi, Lalji Tandon, Varun Gandhi, Yogi Adityanath, who are likely to win again in this election
 tippaniyan The BJP, which is aiming to win 40 seats from Uttar Pradesh, will be discharged from this formula by the struggle of selecting strong candidates for 20 seats

 Pathak says that if the party enters the fray with this formula, then it will get around 40 seats
 yadi party 40 siten jeetne kaa lakshya paane main kaamyaab ho jaati he to dilli main sarkaar bananaa aasaan ho jayega

 Former Supreme Court judge Markandey Katju, who accused the three Chief Justices of the country of 'improper compromise' on the case of allowing a judge surrounded by corruption charges during the UPA government, to hold his post Chief Justice (retd) RC Lohati raised six questions on the issue
 katju ne sawaal kiya ki kya atirikt nyaayadhish ke khilaaf pratikul ibi report milane ke baad tatkaaleen pradhan nyaayadhish lahoti ne teen nyaayadhishon vaale ucchtam nyaayalay ke colegium kii baithak nahin bulaai thi, jisamen vah khud, nyaayamurti waike sabarwal or nyaayamurti rumaa paal shaamil the tathaa ibi report par gaur karte hue colegium ne bharat sarkaar se atirikt nyaayadhish kaa do saal kaa kaarykaal nahin badhaane kii sifarish kii thi? bhartiya press parishad ke adhyaksh katju ne apane blog main lahoti ke samaksh ye sawaal uthaae hai
 Regarding the timing of his statement, Katju said on Monday, "some people have commented on the timing of my statement
" hua yah ki kuch tamil nagarikon ne fasebuk par tippanee kii ki main fasebuk par kai maamalon ko post kar rahaa hum, aise main mujhe madras ucch nyaayalay ke apane anubhavon ke bare main bhi post karnaa chahie
 After this i started posting my experiences
 or yahi samay tha jab mujhe yah vakya bhi yaad aayaa or maine ise bhi post kar diya
 Katju asked, is it not right that the recommendation of the collegium of the three-judge Supreme Court was sent to the government, then he (lahoti), without consulting his two fellow judges of the collegium, gave the Government of India on its behalf Wrote the letter that the government should give a one-year term as additional judge to the judge concerned? He further said in his blog, if after investigation the IB had reported that the judges were found to be involved in corruption then why did they (justice Lohati) recommend to the Government of India to extend the term of this additional judge for one year in the High Court to the Government of India
 Was it? november, 2004 main madras ucch nyaayalay ke mukhya nyaayadhish bane katju ne tivi channelon se kaha, in teen purv pradhan nyaayadhishon ne anuchit samjhaute kiye
 Justice Lahoti started it
 iske baad nyaayamurti sabbarwal or nyaayamurti baalkrishnan ne ise aage badhaayaa
 He was the Chief Justice who can surrender
 kya ek pradhan nyaayadhish ko raajnneetik dabaav ke aage samarpan karnaa chahie athwa use aisa nahin karnaa chahie? baalkrishnan ne unke aaropon ko khaarij karte hue ise ‘puri tarah se aadharahin or tathyaheen’ qaraar diya he
 Katju has been a judge of the Supreme Court from 2006 to 2011
 unhen 5 aktubar, 2011 ko pisiai kaa adhyaksh niyukt kar diya gaya tha or is saal chaar aktubar ko unka kaarykaal samaapt hone vaala he
 He started the blog saying that when Lahoti was asked by some media persons about the blog and my statement printed in a daily, the former Chief Justice said that he had never done anything wrong in life
 katju ne kaha ki vah (lahoti) baarikiyon main nahin gaye, isliye mujhe unke samaksh kuch baarik sawaal khadey karne dijie
 He said, is it not right that at first i wrote him a letter from Chennai, in which he said that there are serious allegations of corruption against a judge of Madras High Court and in this way he (lahoti) is secretly against this additional judge Intelligence investigation should be done and after that i met Justice Lahoti in Delhi and a secret investigation of IB against that additional judge Urged again Rane, about which i had heard many complaints, which is involved in corruption were received from various sources? katju ne kaha, kya yah sahi nahin he ki mere aagrah par nyaayamurti lahoti ne us nyaayadhish ke khilaaf gopneey ibi jaanch kaa aadesh diya? unhone yah bhi sawaal kiya, kya yah sahi nahin he ki dilli main maine unase nijee taur par mulaakaat kii or phir jab main chennai laut gaya tab unhone dilli se mujhe phone kiya or mujhe bataaya ki vistrut jaanch ke baad ibi ne report di he ki nyaayadhish bhrashtachar main sanlipt hai? Now there are also reports that like the Madhya Pradesh government, the central government can increase the age of retirement of its employees by two more years
 bataa den ki madhya pradesh sarkaar ne apane karmchaariyon ke ritairement kii umr ko 2 saal badha di he
 Now the Madhya Pradesh government has increased the retirement age of employees from 60 years to 62 years

 shahrukh khan ne naam na bataate hue kaha ki ek diarector ne unase kaha tha, 'tum itane aam se dikhne vaale or badsoorat ho ki main tumhen kahin bhi istemaal kar saktaa hum
 Shahrukh said, 'I took such roles because i just wanted to act
 isse koi fark nahin padataa agar main rishi kapur yaa amitabh bachchan bananaa chahta, yaa main salmaan khan yaa aamir khan ban jaataa, kyonki wo sab to pehle hi is industry main kaam kar rahe the

 It is to be noted that the first match of the World Cup will be played on 19 February 2011 in Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh
 is maukey par cricketer madanlaal bhi maujuud rahe
 Star batsman Rahul Dravid has requested the International Cricket Council (ICC) to cut the number of 'meaningless' one-day matches and explore the possibility of overnight Test cricket and focus on big tournaments like the World Cup in the 50-over format
 
 unhone kaha, ‘yah daud kam honi chaiye ki do test saat van de or kuch twanti-20 khele jaaen
 People have been saying since 1985 that too many meaningless one-day games are being played
 shaayad ab yah samay aa gaya he ki is bare main kuch kiya janaa chaiye
 There is no point in organizing a series of seven odis
 ’dravid ne kaha, ‘bharat main oktober main bharat englad ek divasiy shrinkhalaa ke dauraan yah sambhavat: pehla mauka rahaa hoga jab darshak match dekhne stadium nahin aaye or yah sthiti chintajanak he
 "dravid said," When India and West Indies played odis, the grounds were filled but this time matches were played in places where there is not much international cricket
 ’salanaa bradmen vyaakhyaan dene aaye dravid yah shrey hasil karne vaale pehle videshi khilaadi hai
 He believes that efforts should be made to draw viewers in Test cricket
 championships 2013 main yojit karaane kii yojana thi lekin praayojakon or prasarakon kii vyasttaaon ke kaaran isisi ne ise 2017 tak sthagit kar diya
 Dravid said that it does not make sense if the stadium is empty if the audience watches the match even on TV
 unhone kaha, ‘khaali padi dderghaayen tivi par bhi acchhee nahin lagati
 The lower TV viewership affects the ratings
 reating girane par media ranneetikaar or vigyapandaata anyatra vikalp talashne lagate hai
 Dravid also appealed to the players to compromise their freedom and privacy to some extent provided it helps in keeping the game free from corruption

 isamen bhi sabase badi jatilta he pita or putr ke bich samvadaheenata
 Mulayam Singh has wept sadly from his party colleagues
 is naaraazgi ne sulah ke saare raste roak rakhe hai
 The story of Akhilesh Yadav's step mother Sadhana Gupta and Amar Singh is also in the background of this whole incident
 akhilesh kheme kaa maananaa he ki unki sauteli maa or amar singh milakar netaji ko bhadkaa rahe hai
 However, no clarification or statement has come publicly from either side
 vahiin mulaayam singh camp main is vivaad kaa thikra ramgopal ke sir phoda ja rahaa he
 He has also been suspended from the party
 lekin apane raajnneetik varchasv ke liye ramgopal akhilesh kaa daaman thame hue hai or unke prati apni vafadari ko doharaa rahe hai
 No decision is easy for Mulayam Singh Yadav at such a time
 faisla kuch bhi ho, chot mulaayam ko hi lagani he
 And Mulayam, who has a habit of winning over others, is now seen losing from his own

 right-arm leg-spinner Anil Kumble had achieved the feat which none other than him and England's Jim Laker could achieve
 kumble ne is din dilli test main prabal pratidwandvi pakistan ke khilaaf duusari pari main sabhi 10 wicket hasil kiye the
 Perfect Ten
 
 
 yah uplabdhi apane aap main behad durlabh he
 Many bowlers have taken eight or nine wickets in the innings before, but the pride of taking the full 10 wickets of an innings is in the name of Kumble and Laker
 kumble kii is karishmai gendbaaji kii badaulat team india ne dilli test 212 ranon ke antar se jeeta tha
 Everyone knows about Kumble's record of 10 wickets, but few people will know that fast bowler Waqar Younis had made a different plan to deprive Jumbo of this record
 apni tufaani ballebaaji se team india ko kai jeet dilaane vaale virendra sahvaag (virender sehwag) ke anusaar, kumble jab is record ke behad najadik pahunch gaye the to krij par utre vakaar younus khud ran out hona chaahate the
 Waqar's intention was to deny Kumble the perfect 10 record by doing so, but Waqar's plan was not successful due to Pakistan team captain Wasim Akram in this test
 akram kii tarif karte hue sahvaag ne twit kiya, 'kismat ke aage, sari sajeesh fail

 Kumble had taken 9 wickets and at the crease he (wasim Akram) and Waqar Younis
 akram ke anusaar, tabhi vakaar mere paas aae or kaha ki kyon na main ran out ho jaaun, taaki kumble 10 wicket na le paaen, is par maine kaha ki agar uski (kumble kii) kismat main 10 wicket hai to tum bhi use nahin roak sakate
 But i assure you that i will not give my wicket to Kumble
 akram ke anusaar, aakhirkaar meraa wicket kumble ke hi khate main gaya or unke 10 wicket puure hue
 In the second innings, Akram was caught by VVS Laxman off Kumble after scoring 37 runs
 pakistan kii puri pari 207 ran par samaapt ho gai thi or kumble ne is pari ke dauraan 74 ran dekar sabhi 10 wicket apane naam kiye the
 In the first innings of this test, Kumble took four wickets

 According to Virender Sehwag, who won Team India many victories with his stormy batting, Kumble was at the crease when Kumble reached the very close of the record, Waqar Younis himself wanted to be run out
 vakaar kii manshaa aisa karke kumble ko parfect 10 ke record se vanchit karne kii thi, lekin is test main pakistani team ke captain wasim akram (wasim Akram) ke kaaran vakaar kii yojana safal nahin ho pai
 Praising Akram, Sehwag tweeted, "next to luck, the whole conspiracy fails

 kumble 9 wicket le chuke the or krij par ve (wasim akram) or vakaar younus the
 According to Akram, then Waqar came to me and said that why should i not run out so that Kumble does not take 10 wickets, then i said that if he (kumble's) luck has 10 wickets then you also cannot stop him

 php The man, who killed his wife's prostitute for alleged reasons of suspicion of illegal ties and taunts of disobedience, was arrested by the police: Superintendent of Police (western Region) Anil Singh Kushwaha told reporters that the identity of the accused was Kamal Kurmi (40) It has taken place unhone bataaya ki camel par 22 may ko yojana kramank
 He is accused of strangling his wife Leela (35) in the 155 area by strangling him with his scarf
 kushavaah ne bataaya ki aaropee ne apni patni kii hatya se pehle kuch kore kaagajon par usase dhokhe se dastakhat kara liye the
 He used these papers to prepare fake suicide notes
 camel ne do pannon ke is patr main lila ke hawaale se likhaa ki vah apni marji se jaan de rahi he
 He said that after executing the murder, the accused hid a fake suicide note in his wife's inner garments
 baharhaal, jab police ne maamle kii jaanch main mili suraagon ke aadhaar par camel se sakhti ke saath poochtacha kii to vah tut gaya or usne apni patni kii hatya kaa jurm kabool kar liya
 According to Kushwaha, Kamal told the police that Leela often harassed her mentally by calling him 'namard'

 It is alleged that he conspired to kill his wife for the same reasons and implemented it

 Let me tell you that due to the defeat in the Lok Sabha elections, Rahul Gandhi had said that he did not want to continue in this post anymore
 52 sadasyon kii congress cameti se unhone kaha tha ki vah adhyaksh banakar nahin rahenge
 But this demand was rejected by the Congress
 party ke kuch varisht netaaon ne is baat ke sanket die the ki keval gandhi parivaar ke sadsy hi congress ko sambhaal sakate hai lekin rahul gandhi ne is baat ko sire se khaarij kar diya tha
 He had said that his mother and sister would not take this responsibility
 loksabhaa chunaav se thik pehle congress ne priyanka gandhi(priyanka Gandhi) kii political entry karakar apana sabase bada siyaasi daanv chal diya
 After the appointment of Priyanka Gandhi as Congress general secretary and the charge of Purvanchal in eastern Uttar Pradesh, such speculation has intensified that Priyanka Gandhi Vadra may contest the Lok Sabha elections
 congress ke diggaj netaa kapil sibbal ne priyanka gandhi ko congress mahasachiv banaae jane ke baad ek twit kiya he, jisase atakalon kaa bazaar tej ho gaya he
 If the tweet of Kapil Sibal seems to be pointing, if it proves right then Priyanka Gandhi can contest from PM Narendra Modi's parliamentary constituency Varanasi or CM Yogi's parliamentary constituency Gorakhpur
 haalanki, abhi tak isaki pushti nahin kii gai he
 Indeed, Congress leader Kapil Sibal made a tweet on Thursday
 is twit main unhone piem modi or amit shah ke congress mukt bharat kaa zikr kiya gaya he
 He has also written that with Priyanka Gandhi's entry in eastern UP, will PM Modi be free Varanasi or CM Yogi free Gorakhpur? 
 haalanki, congress sutron kaa kahana he ki priyanka gandhi apni maa sonia gandhi kii paramparaagat seat raibareli se chunaav lard sakati hai
 But no formal statement has been made on all this yet
 is bich kapil sibbal ne twit kiya aurpriyanka gandhi ke gorakhpur or varanasi se chunaav ladane kaa ishaara kiya
 Modiji and Amit Shah called for a: Congress mukt Bharat With the entry of Priyanka Gandhi in UP (east) will we see a: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 mukt Varanasi? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 mukt Gorakhpur? The political meanings of this tweet are also being taken because in 2014 PM Modi contested from Varanasi and that is his parliamentary constituency
 vahiin siem yogi gorakhpur se chunaav lade the
 Now this tweet is indicating that either Priyanka Gandhi will contest from Varanasi, PM will contest Modi and if she will contest from Gorakhpur then CM Yogi
 haalanki, siem yogi abhi uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri hai or abhi gorakhpur loksabhaa seat sapa ke paas
 Explain that in view of the SP-BSP alliance in UP, the Congress has given the command of Eastern and Western UP to Priyanka Gandhi and Jyotiraditya Scindia respectively to strengthen themselves in UP
 congress sutron kii maane to ek samay congress 10 siton kii ore dekh rahi thi, magar priyanka gandhi ke aane se congress kii najar ab kam se kam 30 siten jeetne par ho gai hai
 Since the murder of Munna Bajrangi in Baghpat Jail in Uttar Pradesh, the big don in the jails of the state has been living in panic
 wo na to apni hai security cell se baahar nikalate hai or na hi peshi main jane ko taiyaar hote hai
 Banda has not been out of his high security cell since the assassination of Mukhtar Ansari Munna Bajrangi in jail
 mukhtaar ansaari ab banda jail main mulaakaat karne aane vaale logon se bhi nahin mil rahe hai
 Sunder Bhati Nemunna, who is called Terror of Western Uttar Pradesh in Jhansi Jail, has refused to go to the court after the murder in Bajrangi Jail
 buudhvaar ko sundar bhaati ko ek maamle main sunwaayee ke liye gajiabad court main janaa tha, lekin police castady main bhi sundar bhaati ne jane se manaa kar diya
 There is a panic among the big dons and criminals in jail that if they can be killed inside the prison, then anything can happen outside the jail
 mukhtaar ansaari ke parijanon ne aupchaarik taur par camera par koi baat to nahin kahi, lekin ishaaron main wo is baat ko kah rahe hai ki agar jail ke bheetar bhi suraksha kii guarantee nahin he, to aise main mukhtaar kii suraksha ko lekar chintaa hona laazmi he
 Significantly, in January this year, there was a sudden rumor in Banda jail that Mukhtar Ansari had been poisoned
 haalanki baad main yah khabar ai ki milane gai patni or mukhtaar donon ko heart atake aayaa he
 The two were then brought to Lucknow, where they were sent back to Banda Jail after recovering after an investigation at PGI

 sibiesai kii 12veen kii pariksha main kul 85
 28 percent of girls passed, while only 75 percent of boys
 90, lekin iaiti kii pravesh pariksha main kul 1
 Only 1,476 girls were selected out of 13 lakh candidates
 sibiesai kii 10veen pariksha main desh bhar se kul 90
 68 percent girls passed, while the number of passed boys is almost two percent less, but out of the total 875 candidates selected in UPSC exam, the number of women is only 195 and there is not a single girl in the top three positions of IIT, is it not a contradiction? Looking at the examination results of the last few years, this contradiction becomes even more pronounced
 skool str par apana paracham fahraane vaali ladakiyon kii sankhya ucch or peshewar shiksha main aate aate kam ho jaati he
 Educationists blame the economic-social scope of the society and the lack of incentives from the government
 ensiiarti ke purv nideshak or rashtriya shikshak shikshan parishad (ensitii) ke purv adhyaksh professor je es rajput kaa maananaa he ki ladakiyon ke liye vigyaan or ganit kii shiksha bahut der se jaruri kii gai, lekin phir bhi ab dhire-dhire ladakiyon kii sankhya in kshetron main bad rahi he
 Pro
 rajput ne kaha ‘1964-66 ke neshnal kamishan on ajukeshan (kothaari kamishan) kii 1968 kii report kii anushansa ke baad ladakiyon ke liye ganit or vigyaan kii shiksha jaruri kii gai, lekin is ayog kii report ko kaaryrup main parinit hone main lanbaa samay lag gaya
 Based on the report, for the first time in 1986, examinations were held in Madhya Pradesh
 ham samaj sakate hai ki ladakiyon sambandhi ek report ko kaaryrup main parinat hone main itnaa samay laga to iske baad is kshetra main pragati hone main kitna samay lagegaa
 ' Pro
 rajput ne kaha ‘lekin phir bhi ab dhire-dhire ladakiyon kaa har kshetra main dakhal bad rahaa he
 However, due to social constraints in the rural areas, girls are still pushed forward in traditional education or are married
 ’unhone kaha ki aise main schuli shiksha main apana paracham fahraane vaali ladakiyon ko aage peshewar shiksha main utarane kaa mauka hi nahin mil paata or yahi is kshetra main unke pichhadane kaa kaaran he
 On the other hand the Vice Chancellor of Kashmir University, Dr
 riyaj punjabi maanate hai ki ladakiyon ko peshewar shiksha main aane ke prati protsaahit karne ke liye sarkaar ko or prayaas karne kii jarurat he
 Dr
 punjabi ne kaha ki saamaajik dharanaon ko badalane or pariwaron ke rukh main badlaav se bhi ladakiyon kii shiksha ke prati desh main kranti aa sakati he
 Dr
 punjabi ne bataaya, ‘aam pariwaron main aaj bhi maukey dena, protsaahan dena or shiksha ke naam par kharch karnaa jaise kaam ladakon ke liye hi hote hai
 There remains the same belief of families that teaching boys will work and girls will go away by marriage
 is rukh ke kaaran paramparaagat padhai main kahin aage rahane vaali ladkiyaan peshewar shiksha main peeche rah jaati hai
 'dr
 punjabi ne salaah di ki sarkaar agar ladakiyon ko ni:shulk koching or behatar shiksha hasil karne par protsaahan swaroop koi yojana shuru kare to ladkiyaan aage bhi ladakon ko bahut peeche chhod den
 Apart from this, the correct implementation of existing schemes can also help them to come forward
 duusari ore jawaharlal nehru vishvavidhyalay ke rector pro
 r Kumar explains the reason behind this trend of girls in basic subjects and less tendency towards field work
 pro
 Kumar said, 'the inclination of girls is usually towards basic subjects
 vigyaan kii bhi baat karen, to bhi ladkiyaan paaramparik vishyon kii ore hi zyada jhukati hai
 Sometimes social and economic circles also prevent girls from going out of the box
 ’unhone kaha ‘ladkiyaan ejineering kii ore aa rahi hai, lekin unki sankhya computer ejineering main zyada he
 In fields like mechanical and civil engineering, field work is more, so girls tend to go less on this side
 medical main bhi aise hi kshetron main ladkiyaan zyada dikhaai detii hai

 koyala ghotaale main congress ne motaa maal banaaya he
 These serious charges, BJP has imposed on the ruling party Congress
 piem ke istife kii maang par adi bijepi ne congress par bhi hamalaa bolte hue kaha ki desi bhashaa main kahen to congress party ne bhi is ghotaale main motaa maal banaaya he
 The party pitted a whole army of leaders against the Congress in this hullabal
 loksabhaa main vipaksh kii netaa sushamaa swaraj yaheen nahin rukii, saaf kar diya ki koi saath aae naa aae, bijepi piem ke istife kii maang se peeche nahin hatane vaali
 When the BJP started the Hallabol, the ministers of the government too came back into the fray
 bijepi ke sawaalon kaa jawaab dene ke liye sarkaar ke teen mantri ek saath aae
 Accusing the opposition of misleading the country
 press conference main congress ne bijepi ko pehle sabhyataa kii paath padhai
 Information Broadcasting Minister Ambika Soni also took charge on behalf of Congress
 unhone kaha ki motaa maal kamaane ke bijepi ke aarope par poocha wo kyon sansad thap kar karodon rupye jaaya kar rahi he
 In fact, the Congress is also following the formula of aggressive strategy
 sutron ke mutabik somvaar ko piem kaa sansad main bayaan bhi isi ranneeti kaa hissaa tha
 The pm's statement was prepared like a lawyer and it is being said that the PAC is ready to respond
 sutron ke mutabik congress ab 26 sitambar 2006 ko likhe kanoon mantralay kii chitthee ke sahare sieji report kii dhajjiyaan udaane kii bhi taiyaari main he
 The government is preparing to prove how to make the report sensational, the CAG quoted the same part of the letter of the Law Ministry in which it was written that the government can initiate the auction process and the need to change the law
 Is not
 sutron ke mutabik kanoon mantralay kii usee chitthee main ye bhi likhaa tha ki behatar hoga ki sarkaar nilaamee ke liye kanoon main badlaav kii prakriya shuru kare
 But the CAG deliberately ignored it while preparing the coal ministry report
 sutron ke mutabik bagaiyr sieji kii manshaa par sawaal uthaae report ke duusare pahaluon par bhi sawalia nishaan lagane kii taiyaari he
 It will be proved that the CAG report is beyond the facts
 ise sansanikhej banaaya gaya he
 The facts of the figures are also incorrect
 or kai mahatvapurn baton ko nazarandaaj kiya gaya he
 According to sources, a letter from 11 mps of 2006 is also in the process of exposing them in which they opposed the auction of coal mines
 isamen 5 bijepi ke, teen congress ke, ek jediu kaa ek jeemem kaa saansad ke dastakhat hai
 The government is making every effort to isolate the BJP and give the message to the common man that the government wanted to run the house
 baharhaal piem ke istife kaa sawaal nahin or bijepi bhi sansad naa chalane dene par adi he
 So the battle has now crossed
 alam yahi rahaa to mumkin he ki sansad jaldi hi anishchit kaal ke liye sthagit ho jaaegi

 Last year in Parliament, many such bills have been approved which are related to the life and rights of ordinary citizens
 bacchee se rape par faansee se judaa aapraadhik kanoon sanshodhan bill ho yaa phir daliton se atyaachaar ke khilaaf SC / ST act sanshodhan bill, ye aise vidheyak the jinase aam log sidhe taur par prabhavit hue hai
 However, many more important Bills are still awaiting the approval of Parliament and such Bills are expected to be passed in the year 2019
 mahila aarakshan bilsansad main kareeb 22 saal se mahilaon ko sansad or vidhansabhaon main 33 fisadi aarakshan dene se judaa bill lataka hua he
 In 2010, this bill was passed by the Rajya Sabha during the UPA government but due to opposition from parties like Samajwadi Party, BSP and Rashtriya Janata Dal in the Lok Sabha, this bill could not be passed
 yah bill 1996 main ech di devegoda sarkaar ne pehali baar pesh kiya tha or tab kai purush saansadon ne iskaa baari virodh kiya tha
 Recently, Congress President Rahul Gandhi had demanded to pass the Women's Reservation Bill in Parliament and said that his party is ready to fully support this bill
 sansad ke maujuuda satr main bhi mahila aarakshan bill ko manjuuri dene kii maang uthi he
 However, for the past four-and-a-half years, the ruling BJP, despite having a majority in the Lok Sabha, made no effort to get the bill passed
 jan lokapal bilbhrashtachar ke khilaaf jaanch ke liye 2011 ke anna andolan main is bill kii purajor maang kii gai thi
 The Lokpal Bill with a history of five decades was approved by the UPA Government in 2013, but till date the Lokpal has not been appointed in the country
 bill paarit hone ke baad saal 2016 main isse jude ek sanshodhan bill ko bhi sansad ke donon sadanon se paarit kiya gaya tha
 The Supreme Court has also said several times to appoint the Lokpal as soon as possible
 yani ye aisa bill he jo paas to ho gaya lekin usapar amal ab tak nahin ho sakaa
 After the formation of the Modi government in the triple talaq bill center, the government has placed the maximum emphasis on any one bill, then it is the same triple talaq bill
 saal 2017 main sarkaar ne muslim mahilaon ke adhikaar se jude is bill ko loksabhaa se paarit kara liya tha lekin rajyasabha main alpamat hone ke chalate bijepi ke liye mushkil hui or yah bill ucch sadan se waapas bhej diya gaya
 After this, the government also brought an ordinance for this
 maujuuda sheetakaaleen satr main kadi mashkkat ke baad sarkaar is bill ko loksabhaa se paarit karaane main safal ho gai
 However, opposition parties, including the Congress, insisted on sending it to the Select Committee
 ab bill rajyasabha main pesh hone vaala he, jahaan sarkaar ke paas paryaapt sankhyabal nahin he
 The Congress and the TMC have again demanded that the triple talaq bill be sent to the Select Committee and this bill has not been tabled in the Rajya Sabha despite all efforts
 sarogesi regulation bilimodi sarkaar saal 2016 main sarogesi ke durupyog ko rokane ke masakad se yah bill lekar ai thi
 The bill was also introduced in the Lok Sabha in January 2017 but after all the objections, the bill was referred to the Standing Committee, since then the bill has been hanging in Parliament
 is satr main sarkaar ne is bill ko loksabhaa se paarit kara liya he lekin rajyasabha se ab bhi ise manjuuri kaa intjaar he
 The bill calls for a ban on commercial surrogacy
 saath hi aise praavdhaan bhi kiye gaye hai jisase nisantan dampati sarogesi kaa sahaara le sakenge
 The Bill defines the term 'mother' in the context of surrogacy and it also sets out who can serve surrogacy
 yah vidheyak mahilaon kaa shoshan rokane main kargar sabit ho saktaa he
 Citizenship Amendment Bill: The amendment bill related to citizenship was also in the top list of the government but this bill has not been approved by Parliament
 saal 2016 main sarkaar ne is bill ko loksabhaa main pesh kiya tha lekin phir ise sanyukt sansadeey samiti (jepisi) ke paas bhej diya gaya
 The JPC headed by BJP MP Rajendra Agarwal will finalize the draft in its next meeting to be held on January 3
 loksabhaa main isi saptaah is vidheyak ko mul rup main pesh kiya jayega, kyonki jepisi ne vipaksh ke sabhi sanshodhano ko naamanzoor kar diya he

 Several Congress leaders will arrive at the CAG office on Thursday with documents related to the Rafale deal
 congress ke pratinidhimandal main ahamed patel, ambika soni, anand sharma, randeep surajevaala samet kai anya netaa shaamil honge
 The Congress was supposed to go for a meeting at CAG at 12 noon, but later this 2
 30 baje ke liye tay hui
 Let me tell you that the Congress leaders have gone to the CAG earlier on the Rafale issue
 congress pichley maheene kaig ke daftar main rafel se judi shikaayat lekar pahunchi thi
 All the spokespersons of the party, including Congress President Shahul Gandhi, are attacking the ruling BJP at the Center these days for allegations of irregularities in the Rafale deal
 is deal ko lekar france ke purv raashtrapati oland ke bayaan ke baad or bhi mudda aakraamak hua tha
 Amid allegations by the Congress on the Rafale deal, this deal is being rightly described by the government
 vitt mantri arun jetali kai baar is mudde par blog likh chuke hai, unhone rahul gandhi ke har aarope ko jhootha qaraar diya he
 On the other hand, the Air Force chief-deputy Chief has given Rafael many times, telling Rafael the need of the army
 haalanki, abhi tak is mudde par pradhanmantrinarendra modine koi bayaan nahin diya he
 What are the allegations of Congress? Rahul Gandhi and Congress have been alleging for the last several months that the price of the aircraft in the previous UPA government, the price of the deal which the Modi government has signed for the purchase of 36 Rafale fighter jets from French company Dassault
 There is a lot more than the agreement that was reached
 isse sarkari khajaane ko hajaaron karod rupye kaa nuksaan hua he
 The party has also claimed that Prime Minister Narendra Modi changed the deal and took the contract from HAL and gave it to Reliance Defense
 loksabhaa chunaav kaa bigul baj chukaa he or sabhi dalon ne apane-apane paksh main matadaataaon ko rijhaane ke liye chunavi reliyaan shuru kar di hai
 Election campaign is also gaining momentum in Delhi

 Kejriwal held two rallies in the East Delhi Lok Sabha constituency on Friday
 pehali reli new ashok nagar main or duusari madanpur khadar ilaake main
 Kejriwal was targeted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the election rally
 unhone centre sarkaar par taanaashaahee karne, kaam par adanga lagane kaa aarope bhi lagaaya
 Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said that 85 per cent seats should be reserved for colleges in Delhi for those doing 12th from Delhi
 50 nae college kholane ke liye pradhanmantri narendra modi ne pichley 4 saal main anumati nahin di
 If full state is formed then 85 percent reservation for children will be done
 mukhyamantri kejariwal ne daawa kiya ki dilli ke purna rajya banane par 2 saal ke andar itane college bana duungaa ki 60 pratishat vaale ko bhi dilli ke college main daakhila milegaa
 All the jobs in Delhi are available to the children outside
 85 pratishat naukariyaan dilli ke voter ke liye rigerv honi chahie
 He surrounded the central government and said that we said everything but the central government did not listen
 abhi ke abhi dilli main 2 lakh vaikency nikal sakati he
 Chief Minister Kejriwal in the cluster area located in Mandanpur Khadar, the home of every voter in 10 years, said that every voter family of Delhi should be made landlord within 10 years when it becomes a full state
 unhone kaha ki 4 saal main pradhanmantri modi ne har kaam ko roka he
 If he wins Modi again, he will stop Delhi's work
 unhone ek bhi kaam bhale kaa nahin kiya
 He further said that the Center has been looting one and a half lakh crores of rupees from Delhi in the name of tax for the last 70 years, but do not give lumps
 angrej bharat kaa paisa lootakar landan le jaaya karte the
 Now the center head car takes all your money to the center
 hamaara paisa hamaare par kharch hona chahie yaa nahin? ambedkar ne kaha tha 'ek aadmi ek vot', lekin dilli waalon kaa aadha vot he
 Delhi government is half government
 ye to beijjati he
 Insult to Delhi
 mukhyamantri kejariwal ne jor dekar kaha ki telugana, uttarakhand or jharkhand jaise bana tha usee tarah se sabko ladane katane ke liye taiyaar rahanaa padegaa
 You will have to make a big movement
 ho saktaa he ki bhagwaan isi chunaav main bedaa paar kar de
 Taking a dig at the ongoing sealing in Delhi, Kejriwal said that Nirav Modi and Vijay Mallya are not caught from the center and they are sealing our shopkeepers
 centre ko ek ordinence paas karnaa he bas
 Had it been a full state, we would have stopped the sealing within 24 hours
 bijepi ai to nahin milegi muft main dawaah amanatullahdusri ore, okhla ke vidhayak amanatullah khan ne madarpur khadar ilaake ke logon se apni kii he ki aam aadmi party kaa saath nahi chhodana

 daawa bhi kiya ki aap kii sarkaar nahin rahegi to sari dawaiya kharidni padegi
 The condition of children will not improve
 vidhayak amanatullah khan ne kaha ki agar purvi dilli se saansad mahesh giri ne ek bhi kaam ilaake main kiya ho to wo apana vot use denge
 Pointing towards the BJP, Amanatullah said that defeat the politics of hate
 unhone yah daawa bhi kiya ki unheen kii vajah se hi sarkari aspataaon main dawa free milti he
 Due to AAP government, thousands of people got treatment in expensive private hospitals for free in 4 years
 unhone kaha ki ye aapke vot kii takat he
 It is important to cast your vote thoughtfully

 boat lifestil ne bharat main pichley maheene kii shuruyaat main apane in-year headphone NIRVANAA TRES ko launch kiya tha
 We gave our time to this earphone and tested it
 ab ham iskaa rivyuu aap tak pahunchaa rahe hai
 Customers can buy it from Amazon India site for Rs 2,982
 haalanki company ne isaki keemat 3,990 rupee rakhi he
 Design and Build Quality: This earphone with a red and black color combination is quite attractive
 yani donon taraf ke yearplag ko kaaphi alag tarah kaa dizin diya gaya he
 This earphone wire has rubber coating
 isaki sabase acchhee baat ye he ki iskaa vir kaaphi lanbaa he or tab bhi ulajhata nahin he
 That is, even if you put it in the pocket using it everyday, even then it does not lose time in solving it
 iske alaava ise kaaphi majboot bhi banaaya gaya he jisase vir ke yearplag se alag ho jane kaa khatra bhi bahut had tak kam he
 In this, remote buttons have been provided to manage calls, pause the song and make the sound less
 isi remote main kol main baat karne ke liye mike bhi maujuud he
 However, a problem may occur to some users that this earphone sometimes does not stay in the ear and goes out
 yani ise kaanon main banaae rakhane ke liye thodi mashkkat jarur kerani pad sakati he
 Performance: boat Nirvana Tres has two 6mm dynamic drivers and one balance armature driver
 donon hi yearplag kii frequency range 20hz – 20khz he
 The presence of a triple driver is what makes this earphone special
 isamen hai-mid-lo teenon hi levels par aapako kaaphi crisp or clear sound quality milti he
 We listened to several genres such as reggaeton, electro, dub, house, metal, jazz, dubstep, full bass, acoustic and trans for testing
 testing ke baad ham isaki quality ke kaaphi impress hue saath hi isaki laudnes bhi kaaphi acchhee he
 Boat claims 6mm dynamic HD drivers act as woofers for low frequencies, while balance armature drivers act as tweeters for high frequencies
 ye teenon drivers mil kar aapako gajab saround kaa anubhav dete hai
 This earphone also has a second frequency with sufficient base
 drivers kii ye khubiyaan bajet main aane vaale yearfones main kam hi dekhne ko milti he
 In such a situation, it is definitely a winner here
 audio quality ke alaava sound yearphone se baahar nahin bhi nahin aati
 But we do have some complaints about Mike
 chunki isaki keemat 3 hajaar rupee ke kareeb he to hamen isse behatar anubhav kii ummid thi
 In this, while talking in the call, Mike feels the need to be completely close to the face
 pareshaani tab or bad jaati he jab aapasadakamen trephic ke bich hon
 But you can clearly hear about the front
 faisla:behtareen dizin or bild quality hone ke saath-saath crisp or clear audio rispons isaki khaasiyat he
 There may be some disappointment about Mike's experience, but music lovers can spend money on this earphone available in the budget

 - Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) April 22, 2014 Modi did not name anyone on Twitter, but it is clear that he has said this in relation to Togadia's controversial statement
 gauratlab he ki praveen togadiya ek video main apane kaaryakartaaon ko musalamaanon ke ghar par kabja karne ke liye uksaate dikh rahe hai
 Modi wrote, 'some such statements claiming to be well wishers of BJP are distracting the election campaign
 'congress ne modi ke twit ko 'ghadiyaali aansu' qaraar diya he
 Party leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi said that the BJP has not canceled Giriraj Singh's ticket, so his condemnation is a tear
 vahiin bispi pramukh mayawati ne is puri bayaanbaji ko mili-juli sajeesh qaraar diya
 Togadia appears to be caught in trouble in the case of 'hate speech' filed against Togadia

 Togadia also mocked the law? On the matter of the extermination of a Muslim from a Hindu-dominated area, Pravin Togadia is seen saying in this video, 'take possession of the house forcefully, after this the case will go on for years
 'unhone muslim parivaar ko 48 ghante main ghar khaali karne kii chetavanee di or kaha, 'agar aisa nahin hota he to uske offis pathar, tair or tamaato lekar pahunch jaaen
 There is nothing wrong in this

 The International Cricket Council (ICC) also described the pitch of the third Test cricket match played between India and Australia on the MCG as 'average' like Perth Stadium

 According to the report, the ICC on Tuesday confirmed the average status
 yah pichley saal drow chute ashes test match kii tulana main behatar darja he, kyonki tab emsiji kii pich ko teen ‘dimerit point’ mili the
 Achieving average status means that this field has not received any 'demerit point' from the ICC
 isisi ke niyam ke anusaar agar kisi match sthal ko paanch saal ke andar paanch ‘dimerit point’ milte hai, to uskaa antarrashtriya darja khatm ho jaataa he
 The MCG pitch came into limelight when India scored 443 runs after batting for almost two days
 yahaan tak ki uske pramukh ballebaaj cheteshwar pujaara ne dhimi ballebaaji kaa kaaran pich kii prakruti ko bataaya tha
 However, when India bowled, it seemed that the wicket had come alive

 The current pitch of the MCG is 15 years old, but will also be used next season
 nai pich taiyaar karne main teen saal kaa samay lagegaa
 Earlier, the Perth Stadium pitch was also rated average by the ICC , which was surprised by many former cricketers including Australian coach Justin Langer
