 Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad was a Rajya Sabha MP from Bihar
 yah seat unhone patna sahib se chunaav ladane ke liye chodi thi
 Shatrughan Sinha was nominated by the Congress from Patna Sahib seat
 yahaan kaa sabase romaanchak muqabla mana ja rahaa tha

 This was the biggest defeat for the Congress

 The Congress currently has 72 mlas in the Assembly
 jabaki bijepi ke paas 100 vidhayak hai

 The accent in which he talks to Aarti is very dirty

 Aarti is very good friend of Siddharth Shukla and she stands with Siddharth in everything

 This bad behavior of Siddharth has been pointed out by Gauhar Khan in his tweet

 Is BJP abandoning its insistence on stopping the biggest liberalization of the Indian market? Has Prime Minister Narendra Modi dared to awaken the lion of the retail business, which is equipped with the power of 125 crore consumers and $ 600 billion business and where after foreign and private investment, the engine of multifaceted growth can be started in the entire economy
 
 agar khudara kaarobaar main 51 fisadi videshi nivesh ke faisle par nai sarkaar kii sahmati or bijepi va uske sahyogi dalon ke rajyon kii manjuuri dikhaava nahin he to phir ise modi sarkaar kii pehali varshganth kaa sabase saahsee tohfa mana janaa chahie
 It was only the conservative insistence of the BJP, due to which the huge retail market of the country could not get the light of modernity, which could benefit from infrastructure, farming, employment to consumers
 retail kaa udaarikaran hokar bhi nahin ho sakaa
 The previous government opened 51% foreign investment in multi-brand retail in September 2012, but after overwhelming opposition from the BJP, the option of allowing investors was left to the states
 siyasat is kadar ho chuki thi ki kisi rajya ne aage badhane kii himmat hi nahin dikhaai
 The government's U-turn on FDI in retail is fresh because in April, Commerce and Industry Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had told the Lok Sabha that no decision has been taken on the policy of foreign investment in multi-brand retail
 yah pahalu badal shaayad bhoomi adhigrahan par mili naseehaton se upja he
 Modi is accepting that advocating for a strict land acquisition law while in opposition was the bjp's fault
 thik aisi hi galati retail main epadiai ke virodh ke jariye hui thi jise ab thik karne kaa vakt he
 The decision to increase the foreign investment limit to 51 per cent in the retail business was due to the same challenges that the Modi government is now facing
 mandi va bekaari se pareshaan upie sarkaar khudara kaarobaar main videshi nivesh laana chaahati thi taaki growth kaa jariya khul sake
 This was a revolutionary liberalization
 isliye global chhavi bhi chamakane vaali thi
 In the last one year, the Modi government has not been able to increase the lump sum supply of jobs or to make major reforms
 alabatta ab mauka saamne he
 According to the latest documents from the Ministry of Industry, 12 states including Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, including the BJP, its allies and the Congress are agreeing to give entry to foreign companies in retail business
 samarthan kii aisi sthiti pehle kabhi nahin bani thi
 This is the best opportunity to show courage to call foreign retail companies
 bharat kii upbhog khapat hi arthvyavastha kaa ingine he jiske boote 2004 se 2009 ke bich sabase tej growth ai thi
 Farming is behind the retail market, there are industries in the middle and consumers ahead
 upbhog kharch hi maang, rojgaar, aay main badhat, kharch va khapat kaa chakra taiyaar karata he, jo retail kii buniyaad he
 Retail is the third largest source of employment in India employing 40 million people
 skill deveopment mantralay maanata he ki 2022 tak is kshetra main kareeb 5
 5 crore people will get employment
 yah akalan is kshetra main videshi nivesh se aane vaali growth kii sambhaavna par aadhaarit nahin he
 The latest Boston Consulting report states that India's retail business will be worth $ 1 billion by 2020, at $ 600 billion today
 khudara kaarobaar kaa aadhunikeekaran, naukariyon kaa sabase bada jariya ho saktaa kyonki supplai chen se lekar store tak sangathit retail main sabase zyada rojgaar banate hai
 Inconsistencies over foreign investment in traditional retail have led to growing inconsistencies due to e-retail
 i-retail main tex, nivesh, gunvattta, paardarshita ke sawaal to apni jagah hai hi
 This has not led to much better employment than delivery man
 retail main nayaa nivesh, construction kii maang ko waapas lautaa saktaa he jo is samay gahari mandi main he or kheti ke baad rojgaron or maang kaa doosraa bada jariya he
 Retail brings a new market and tens of services to consumer products industries which is a part of Make in India
 retail kaa 60 fisadi hissaa khaadya va grosri kaa he jo ki pratyaksh rup se kheti se judata he
 Modern retail will be a big market for farmers and small scale industries
 retail ko lekar kuch nae tathy tasdik karte hai ki sarkaar iske sahare growth ke ingine main eendhan bhar sakati he
 According to the new GDP calculation, the pace of economic growth has increased from five percent to 7
 5 fisadi pahunchane ke peeche vishaal thok va khudara kaarobaar kii growth he
 The overall size of this business could not capture the old figure of GDP calculation
 puraane paimaane ke tahat thok va retail kaarobaar kaa, jidipi main yogadan naapane ke liye eneseso ke rojgaar survey kaa istemaal hota tha lekin nae formule main cell tex ke aankade ko aadhaar banaaya gaya to pataa chalaa ki thok va khudara kaarobaar na keval arthvyavastha kaa 20 fisadi he balki iske badhane kii raftarideepi kii dogunihai
 It would be better to listen to rahul-sonia's speeches against the changes in the Land Acquisition Act, along with Arun Jaitley's speech against foreign investment in retail
 isse yah ehsaas ho jayega ki bharat kii raajnneeti chunaav se chunaav tak kaa maukaparast khel he or congress-bijepi nitigat doordarshita main behad daridr hai
 However, changing decisions is also a proof of courageous politics
 isliye pradhanmantri agar nai soch kaa saahas dikhaa rahe hai to unhen bhoomi adhigrahan ke saath 125 karod logon ke vishaal khudara bazaar ke udaarikan kii himmat bhi dikhaani chahie jo keval bijepi kii dakiyanoosee siyasat ke kaaran aage nahin bad sakaa
 His courage can change both the appearance and the beauty of the economy
 loksabhaa chunaav main rajg ko mili baari bahumat ko congress dwaara marketing propaganda bataae jane kaa jawaab dete hue varisht bhaajapa netaa or videshmantri sushamaa swaraj ne congress par palatwaar kiya or kaha ki marketing hi kaaphi nahin, balki product bhi acha hona chahie
 Sushma retaliated to Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge's remarks about the victory achieved by BJP through marketing and said, "marketing was done by AAP (congress) too, but there is a fundamental principle of marketing that the product must be good
" sushamaa ne congress par yah chutki lene ke saath hi kaha ki jitani badi jeet rajg ko mili he uske kandhon par utani hi badi jimmedaari bhi aa gai he, jiskaa nirvahan vah sabhi sahyogi dalon ko saath lekar karegi
 He quoted the dialogue between Bhishma Pitamah and Yudhishthira in the Mahabharata, saying that Bhishma Pimamah had given Yudhishthira the message of never abdicating his responsibility by cursing the past, because if the past was good then the public would not change it
 videsh mantri ne raashtrapati ke abhibhaashan par pesh dhanyavad prastaav par charchaa main hastkshep karte hue kaha ki samprag sarkaar ke prati janata kaa gussa or narendra modi ke rup main bhaajapa ko vikalp ke rup main janata dwaara sweekaar kiya janaa hi itani badi jeet kaa aadhaar bana
 He attributed the defeat in the UPA government to inflation, corruption, glut of scandals, farmers' outcry, young unemployed, mistreatment of women, mistreatment of institutions and bad treatment from soldiers on the borders and the government's defeat
 Will work for improvement on all fronts

 The UP government is ready for all possible help
 iske baad is maamle main ek baar phir nayaa mode aata dikh rahaa he
 Taking forward the tradition of the Nath sect, whether Yogi Adityanath will be able to complete the construction of the Ram temple or not, the future will decide, but this community has an old association with the Ram temple
 upi ke siem yogi adityanath ke guru ke guru ne jis ram mandir kii neenv rakhane main ahm bhoomika nibhaai thi, lagata he wo kaam ab yogi puraa karenge
 By the way, Adityanath is the most popular among the Mahants of the Nath sect
 par jis raste par aaj ve hai, uski disha dikhaane kaa shrey mahant digvijaynath ko diya jaataa he
 Mahant Digvijaynath, Guru of Adityavanath was the mentor of Mahant Avaidyanath
 unhone hi babari masjid ke andar ramalala kii murti sthapit karne main ahm yogadan diya tha
 CM Yogi is strict, not just slaughterhouse
 
 
 UP main ye kaam bhi ho sakate hai bandakaha jaataa he ki 1949 main digvijaynath ne akhil bhartiya ramayana mahasabha jwine kii
 The same Mahasabha organized a nine-day recitation of Ramcharitmanas in front of the Babri Masjid, at the end of which the idols of Lord Rama and Sita were installed inside the mosque
 kuch reports ye bhi kahati hai ki ramalala kii murti ko digvijaynath ne hi sthapit kiya tha
 The discussion of Digvijaynath is also important because when he became the Mahant of the Nath sect in 1934, the temple had become the center of the politics of staunch Hindutva
 unhen mahatma gandhi kii hatya kii sajeesh main shaamil hone ke aarope main giraftaar bhi kiya gaya tha

 com / g97ajbqugo — Rahul Gandhi (@rahulgandhi) May 5, 2018 In the video, which Sawalrahul has shared with PM Modi, many questions have been asked to PM Modi
 -kya aap reddy bandhuon ko die gaye 8 tikat par 5 minute bolenge?-kya apane mukhyamantri ummidavaar (bies yediurppa) par bolenge, jinke khilaaf bhrashtachar or dhokhadhadi jaise 23 cese darj hai?-aap un 11 mantriyon par kab bolenge, jinke khilaaf bhrashtachar ke cese hai?is video main baqayada in netaaon ke naam or photo bhi lagaae gaye hai
 Also, corruption of the Reddy brothers has also been shown prominently
 video ke ant main likhaa gaya he ki hamen aapke jawaab kaa intjaar he
 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar is somewhat philosophical in his speech at every event
 nitish kumaar somvaar ko bihar ke khadyann vyavsaayiyon ke ek kaarykram main shaamil hue
 He clearly said that do not worry about safety
 agar aapako koi samasya ai to ham turant aapako suraksha pradaan karenge
 Nitish said that this is what you will say, do not worry, sometimes there is fear in the mind of the meaningless
 unhone kaha ki aajkal mere paas bahut log aate hai
 It is said that provide security to us
 ham un logon ko samajhate hai ki suraksha kaa koi matlab nahin he
 After all, who killed Indira Gandhi, the Prime Minister of this country? Who and when, tell who killed, who knows when and what will happen
 nitish ne kaha ki chintaa mat kariye, jo aadmi chintaa nahin karegaa vah aadmi bahut bulandi ke saath kaam karegaa
 Nitish said that we will advise do not worry
 aapako lage samasya aa gai he hamalon kii to suchit kiijie, ham zarur suraksha pradaan karenge or gadabad karne waalon ko chodenge nahin
 Nitish again said that incidents happen and action is taken after analyzing them
 lekin unke sarkaar main naa kisi ko fansaaya jaataa he naa hi bachaaya jaataa he
 They said that they do not know who will do what, but they are not going to leave it

 The bjp-led coalition has decided to wait until the Congress-led UPA candidate comes out and clarifies the changing political equations

 We exchanged views with constituents and gave an overview of the political events on the subject so far
 ’2012 ke raashtrapati chunaav kii tulana 1969 ke chunaav se karte hue unhone kaha, ‘ham kisi jaldbaaji main nahin hai

 ’adwani ne kaha ki shuukravaar ko shaam chaar baje samprag kii baithak he, pehle unako naam kii ghoshnaa karne dijie

 ’ adwani ne kaha ki raashtrapati pad ke chunaav ke mudde par hamane sabhi gaiyr congressi dalon, khaas kar vipakshi dalon ke sampark main rahane kaa faisla kiya he
 Significantly, the Trinamool Congress, which is in the UPA government, has asked all political parties to support former President APJ Abdul Kalam while rejecting the names of potential Congress candidates for the post of President
 trinmul pramukh mamata banerjee ne kaha ki kalam sapa or trinmul congress ke ummidavaar hai
 At the same time, the SP, which has been supporting the government from outside, hinted at keeping the path of talks open in the name of Pranab for the presidency, putting an end to the speculation of wanting a mid-term election and said that he is in favor of such a situation
 adwani ne kaha, ‘sarkaar or uske ghatak dalon main aapasi vishwaas kii baari kami he
 This is the first government in independent India, from Pandit Nehru to Manmohan Singh, with complete lack of cohesion and mutual dialogue
 ’unhone kaha ki sarkaar main vibhinn staron par saamanjasy kii kami ke kaaran desh ko aaj aarthik morche par kaaphi kharaab halaat se guzarana pad rahaa he, vahiin jis tarah se raashtrapati chunaav ke vishay ko aage badhaayaa gaya, usase raajnneeti ko nuksaan pahunch rahaa he
 The senior BJP leader said that contact at the top level in the ruling coalition is broken
 yah sabhi staron par dikhataa he
 It is also clear from this that one component of the ruling coalition (trinamool Congress) talks about making Prime Minister Manmohan Singh the presidential candidate
 unhone kaha ki guuruuvaar ko chennai main unki tamilnadu kii mukhyamantri se charchaa hui or unhone bhi isi tarah kii baat kahi

 The RJD leader said that it is the result of mistrust between the two leaders that Nitish Kumar is unable to raise a demand from Prime Minister Modi for special status for Bihar
 NDA kii raily se pehle tejasvi yadav ne donon netaaon se sawaal kiya he
 He asked whether Nitish Kumar still considers BJP as "burn India Party" and "badka False Party"? If you agree then why are you together? If you do not agree then apologize for your earlier statement? Former Deputy Chief Minister of Bihar said whether Narendra Modi still gives JDU "suppression and oppression of public" Believe it? If we believe then why is there in the oppression and oppression of the public? He said that will Narendra Modi apologize to the people of Bihar for not refusing to give their special state status? Modi ji had promised and announced several times in the Lok Sabha elections to give special status to Bihar? Will Modi ji give a detailed account of the special package of 1 lakh 65 thousand crores to the people of Bihar? Does Nitish still consider BJP as "burn India Party" and "badka False Party"? If you believe, why are you together? If you do not believe then apologize for your statement? Does Modi ji still consider JDU to be "suppression and oppression of the people"? If he believes then why is he in the oppression and oppression of the people? pic

The RJD leader said that Modi took action against 33 more scams like Nitish Kumar's 33 scams and the subsequent creation
 If Modi is honest against corruption then why not speed up the CBI investigation of creation and other scams against Nitish Kumar? Modi ji, this dualism will not work in Bihar? It is worth mentioning that people have started coming to Patna a day before to participate in the NDA resolution rally

 On the very first day of the first Test match against Sri Lanka in Gaul, Shikhar Dhawan played a stunning 190-run stormy innings, but along with him, Cheteshwar Pujara, who is considered to be the wall of Team India, also showed his bat's jewelery
 
 cheteshwar pujaara ne ek baar phir apni class or sanyam kaa loha manavaate hue shandaar shatak jadaa

 He did this feat in the 49th Test match
 cheteshwar pujaara bharat kii over se 49 test maichon main sabase zyada shatak lagane vaale ballebaajon kii suchi main tisare number par hai
 The first number comes from Sunil Gavaskar, who scored 19 centuries in 49 Tests
 13 shatak lagaakar duusare number par viraat kohli hai
 At the same time, Virender Sehwag had completed 12 centuries in 49 Tests and Pujara equaled him
 videsh main teesraa shatkagal main shatak jamaate hi cheteshwar pujaara ke videsh main teen shatak puure ho gaye
 Cheteshwar Pujara may have scored 12 centuries in Test cricket but only 3 centuries have come off his bat abroad
 do shatak unhone srilanka main banaae hai or ek shatak pujaara ne south africa main lagaaya he
 Record partnership with Dhawan Team India lost the first wicket early as Abhinav Mukund but then Shikhar Dhawan teamed up with Cheteshwar Pujara to form a marathon partnership of 253 runs for the second wicket

 Sheila vs Maken's fight in the Delhi Congress has now reached the court of the Gandhi family
 emsidi chunaavon main haar ke baad shila ne ajay maakan kaa istipha maanga tha, maakan ne istipha de bhi diya tha, lekin ab tak us par koi faisla nahin hua, balki faisla hone tak maakan ko kaam karte rahane ko kaha gaya
 In such a situation, about a dozen party leaders from Delhi met under the leadership of Sheela recently at the house of Rajya Sabha MP Kapil Sibal
 baithak main sabhi netaaon ne maakan kii kaaryastylee par sawaal uthaaye
 All the leaders also prepared a memorandum and all submitted it to Rahul
 shila samet in netaaon ne sonia se bhi milane kaa samay maanga he
 The party's internal front against Ajay Maken has not sought Ajay Maken's resignation in his memorandum, but has clearly stated that he is not taking the party leaders along
 in netaaon kaa tark he ki maakan ko free hand diya gaya, unhone apane hisaab se tikat baante, lekin phir bhi party buree tarah haari
 Not only this, many leaders left the party accusing Ajay Maken
 aarope ye bhi he ki maakan ne akele hi har ranneeti banaai or senior party netaaon kii koi puch nahin he
 Sheila even sought Ajay Maken's resignation after the defeat of MCD
 kapil sibbal ke ghar baithkkapil sibbal ke ghar hui baithak main shila dikshit, ramakant goswami, haaron usoof, rajkumaar chouhan or khud sibbal samet kareeb ek darjan netaa shaamil the, jabaki swasthya thik naa hone ke chalate e ke walia or mangatraam singhl ne apni likhit sahmati bhej di
 These leaders demand that there should be a leader in Delhi who will give a strong fight to the Aam Aadmi Party and BJP by taking everyone along before the next assembly elections
 is samay party ko majboot karne kii jarurat he kyonki, is samay dilli main party ded si ho gayi he
 These leaders submitted their memorandum to Rahul, then later Sheila Dixit personally met Rahul and complained about Ajay Maken and requested to take the state Congress out of the predicament
 sutron ke mutabik, ajay maakan ne rahul ko bataaya tha ki, emsidi chunaav aurarajouri garden vidhansabhake upachunaav main party kaa mat pratishat badha he
 So Sheila, especially Sheila, tried to dismiss Maken's claim that Rahul met political parties to win elections and form a government, not to increase his vote percentage
 aise main desh kii sabase badi party agar mat pratishat badhane kii baat se khush hogi to ye durbhaagya he
 However, Parishila Dixit refused to talk on the issue
 sutron ke mutabik, maakan virdohi kheme ke netaaon ne tay kiya he ki, chunki abhi wo alaakaman se baat kar rahe hai, isliye media se is bare main koi charchaa nahin karenge
 Overall, even though the Congress remains the third-party party in Delhi, the Sheila versus Maken battle is growing rather than halting
 aise main dilli main vaapasi kaa congress kaa khwab abhi to dur kii kaudi hi dikh rahaa he

 The newly formed group 'swaraj Abhiyan' said on Saturday that it would not ask social activist Anna Hazare to join her for the moment
 aisa isliye kyonki isse samooh par unke jaisi badi hasti kii madad lene kaa aarope lag saktaa he, lekin samooh bhavishya main unase sampark kar saktaa he
 Swaraj Abhiyan leader Yogendra Yadav said in Goa, 'we may wish to add him (anna Hazare) in future
 ham unase hamaara saath dene or hamaara maargdarshan karne kaa anurodh karenge, lekin hamane philhal unase sampark nahin kiya he
 Yadav has gone to Goa on a private tour and will also meet local leaders
 unhone kaha ki yadi ve aisa karte hai to aap se alag hue netaaon yogendra yadav or prashanth bhushan dwaara gathit samooh swaraj abhiyaan par aap samet anya partiyon kii tarah kisi badi hasti kii madad lene kaa aarope lag jayega
 Yadav said, 'they have not denied
 ham maargdarshan ke liye unke paas nahin gaye hai
 He said that he is meeting ordinary people struggling for the country and this is more important
 yadav ne ek prashn kaa jawaab dete hue dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ko pradarshan ke aadhaar par ek se 10 se bich ank dene se inkaar kar diya
 The leader said, 'every Chief Minister should be given a long time to assess
 unhen abhi aankna galat hoga
 ' yadav ne kaha, ‘vastav main hamane swaraj abhiyaan kii ek niti banaai he ki ham aap ke rosemara ke maamalon par tippanee nahin karenge
 The media likes this but we will not comment
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘hamane tomars (dilli ke purv kanoon mantri) ke maamle par tippanee kii, hamane dilli sarkaar dwaara jari saarvajanik vigyaapan ke maamle par tippanee kii
 We commented on the Lt
 Governor's case as they were policy related matters
 ’ yadav ne kaha ki dilli ko purna rajya kaa darja die jane kii maang nyyochit he
 He said, 'every selected government should have the right to transfer its officers
 mujhe lagata he ki aadesh ke takaraav kii raajnneeti purna rajya kaa darja paane kii koshish karne kaa ek aparipakv rasta he
 This is a very childish way of dealing with a very legitimate demand related matter
 is aparipakvata ke kaaran kuch hasil hone ke bajaae pratikul asar pad saktaa he
 In response to another question, Yadav claimed that the AAP leaders have compromised but this does not mean that volunteers have done so as well
 unhone kaha, ‘kisi saamaanya swayamsevak ne samjhauta nahin kiya he
 You are some of the best social activists in the movement
 unhone bhrashtachar se samjhauta nahin kiya he
 This feeling of theirs has to be kept alive
 ’tippaniyan Yogendra Yadav said that he had not yet received a letter to expel him from the party
 yadav ne kaha, ‘mujhe televijan channelon ke madhyam se pataa chalaa ki mujhe nishkasit kar diya gaya he
 i have written a letter to the disciplinary committee of AAP regarding giving me the expulsion letter which they have not given
 ’ When Yadav was asked how he felt when he was expelled from the party, he said, 'I am not one of those who can express their feelings but it does not look good when you are kept out of your own house
 yah acha nahin lagata
 'he said,' but you also remind yourself that you have chosen to walk on a difficult path, it will be a long journey, a stumbling block cannot stop a long journey
 ek baar girane par aapako yah kehane kaa avasar miltaa he ki thik he, mujhe or majboot hone kii aavashyaktaa he
 ' swaraj abhiyaan ke netaa yogendra yadav ne goa main kaha, ‘hamaari bhavishya main unhen (anna hajaare ko) jodne kii ichha ho sakati he
 We will request them to support us and guide us, but we have not yet contacted them
 ’ yadav ek nijee daure par goa gaye hai or vah sthaneey netaaon se bhi mulaakaat karenge
 He said that if they do, then the Swaraj Abhiyan, a group formed by AAP leaders Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan, will be accused of seeking help from a big figure like other parties, including you
 yadav ne kaha, ‘unhone inkaar nahin kiya he
 We have not gone to him for guidance
 ’ unhone kaha ki ve desh ke liye sangharsh kar rahe saadhaaran logon se mil rahe hai or yah adhik mahatvapurn he
 Yadav, while replying to a question, refused to give between one and 10 points to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on the basis of performance
 netaa ne kaha, ‘aankane ke liye har mukhyamantri ko ek lanbaa samay diya janaa chahie
 It would be wrong to judge them now
 ’ Yadav said, 'actually we have made a policy of Swaraj Abhiyan that we will not comment on aap's everyday affairs
 media ko yah pasand he lekin ham tippanee nahin karenge
 He said, 'we commented on the case of Tomar (former Law Minister of Delhi), we commented on the matter of public advertisement issued by the Delhi Government
 hamane uparajyapal ke maamle par tippanee kii kyonki ve niti sambandhi maamle the
 Yadav said that the demand for full statehood status to Delhi is justified
 unhone kaha, ‘har chaynit sarkaar ko apane adhikariyon ko sthanantarit karne kaa adhikaar hona chahie
 i think the politics of conflict of order is an immature way of trying to get full statehood
 yah ek bahut jaij maang sambandhi maamle se nipatane kaa ek bahut bachakaana tarika he
 This immaturity may have adverse effects rather than being achieved
 ’ yadav ne ek anya prashn ke uttar main daawa kiya ki aap netaaon ne samjhauta kiya he lekin iskaa yah matlab nahin he ki swayasevakon ne bhi aisa kiya he
 He said, 'no general volunteer has compromised
 aap andolan main kuch behtareen saamaajik kaaryaktaa hai
 They have not compromised on corruption
 unki is bhaavana ko jivit rakhana hoga
 Comments yogendra yadav ne kaha ki unhen party se nishkasit kiye jane sambandhi patr abhi tak nahin mila he
 Yadav said, 'I came to know through television channels that i have been expelled
 maine aap kii anushaasanamak samiti ko mujhe nishkasit kiye jane sambandhi patr dene ke sambandh main patr likhaa he jo unhone nahin diya he

 Media coverage is also not proving helpful in dealing with water crisis
 Water is not a common issue, but it is also political, social and economic
 Along with climate change, the water crisis is also increasing worldwide
 jal sankat ke chalate desh main krishi bhi prabhavit hui he
 In India Today Conclave 2019, senior journalist and founding editor of People's Archive of Rural India P
W
 sainath ne jal sankat ke vibhinn pahaluon kaa zikr kiya
 He said that people say that the next world war will be for water, i do not know when it will happen, but there has been a war over water for the last two thousand years
 pi
 Sainath said that there is a difference between politics on water and being a politician for water
 media kawarej bhi jal sankat se nipatane main madadgaar sabit nahin ho paa rahaa he
 If we look at the headlines of the newspapers for the last two or three weeks about the rain, then we will know how limited the water crisis is being viewed
 ek baat to saaf he ki barish ke pani se bhumigat jal ke str main koi sudhaar nahin ho rahaa he
 He said that he talks about Andhra Pradesh
 pichley kuch saalon kaa udhaaharan len
 Out of the last 20 years, Andhra Pradesh has been in drought conditions for 16 years
 sabase mahatvapurn jal bantwaare kaa masalaa he
 The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) said in 2018 that the monsoon has been almost normal
 lekin pichley 100 saalon main meri jaankaree main nahin he ki monsoon ko lekar is tarah kii koi catagori rahi ho
 Meaning you are saying that the man is in ICU but not dead
 barish ko saamaanya ke kareeb isliye bataa rahe hai kyonki saamaanya se kam barish hui
 P
 sainath ne kaha ki iemdi ke kshetravaar aankade bataate hai ki barish kii dar main baari kami ai he
 The issue of water is not only common but it is also a political, social and economic issue

 India has managed to surround Pakistan on every issue of terror in the SAARC conference held in Islamabad
 grih mantri rajnath singh guuruuvaar ko sammelan main hissaa lekar bharat laut aae hai
 He heard the neighbor entering his house very well, while on Friday he would also give a statement in Parliament
 pakistan ko dikhaaya aainasvadesh lautne ke baad rajnath singh ne pradhanmantri narendra modi se bhi mulaakaat kii
 He gave the details of his visit to the PM
 rajnath ne dilli pahunchakar kaha ki unhone bharat se jude sabhi mudde uthaae
 Pakistan's home minister showed his limits to Pakistan
 alam yah rahaa ki rajnath ke bhaashan ke media kawarej par roak laga di gai
 Later, the Home Minister did not participate in the luncheon held at the conference
 'aatank ko panaah dene vaale deshon ko alag-thalag karen'rajnath singh ne kaha ki un deshon ko alag-thalag kiya janaa chahie, jinhone apni dharti koatankiyoke liye panaahagaah bana rakhaa he
 It has been said in Rajnath Singh's statement that terrorism is not good and bad
 aatankwaad ko ham koi rang nahin de sakate, aatankwaad aatankwaad hota he
 Home Minister Rajnath has also given a befitting reply to declaring Burhan Wani as a martyr from this forum

 The PAK told the terrorists that the question of social service of Pakistan raises the question whether the Government of Pakistan considers the terrorist organization as a social organization and terrorists Hafiz Saeed and Salauddin as social workers? In fact, calling Hafiz Saeed and Salauddin a protest against Rajnath Singh, who took part in the SAARC conference, is a social worker, reflecting the insolvency of Pakistan on the issue of terrorism

 bainkon ke saamne non parforming asset kii samasya purv rigerv bank governraraghuram rajanke bayaan ke baad or gambhir ho gai he
 In a letter to the Estimate Committee of the Lok Sabha, Raghuram Rajan, while hiding the mystery of the NPA problem, wrote that the country's banks are sitting on a time bomb and if the bomb is not defused soon, no one can stop it from exploding
 gauratlab he ki estimet cameti ne purv governor se cameti ke saamne pesh hone kii apil kii thi or bainkon ke enpie par apana paksh rakhane ke liye kaha tha
 The committee had also given permission to Rajan to put his side through the letter, after which Raghuram Rajan gave his reply to the Lok Sabha committee in a sequential manner on the NPA
 raghuram rajan ne daawa kiya ki bainkon ke saamne sabase zyada bed lone aise hai jinhen 2006 se 2008 ke bich aavantit kiya gaya
 For the Indian economy, this was a time when the economic growth rate was very good and banks needed to increase this speed by giving more and more loans
 lekin aisi paristhiti main bainkon ko chahie tha ki vah karj dene se pehle yah sunishchit karata ki jin companiyon ko vah karj de rahaa he unka swasthya acha he or vah samay rahete apane karj kaa bhugtan karne kii sthiti main hai
 The negligence of the banks is unmatched
 Raghuram Rajan claimed that while the banks were negligent in disbursing new loans during this period, they acted to give loans to those who have a history of not returning the loan
 lihaaja, yah bainkon kii bahut badi galati thi or desh main gande karj kii shuruyaat thi
 Rajan claimed that a promoter who took a loan during this period told him that the bank was giving loans even to those who did not need the loan and the bank merely asked the company to tell it how much money it needed
 And that loan was given to the company
 girte rupee ko bachaane ke liye modi sarkaar apnayegi manmohan vaala formula?haalanki raghuram rajan ne kaha ki aise duniya ke anya deshon main bhi dekhne ko mila ki jab arthvyavastha acha kar rahi hoti he to bank zyada se zyada karj bazaar ko dene ko praathamikta dete hai
 But in such a situation, the bank needed to be more vigilant as a fast running economy could be weakened due to non-return of these loans
 sarkari bainkon se nahin thi ye ummidarghuram rajan ne enpie kaa thikra desh kii banking vyavastha par phodte hue likhaa ki enpie ke khel main desh ke sarkari bainkon kii bhoomika behad kharaab rahi
 According to Rajan, such negligence in the allocation of loans from public sector banks could not be expected
 rajan ke mutabik karj dene ke baad bainkon ne samay-samay par companiyon dwaara karj kii rakam kharch kiye jane kii sud nahin lee jiske chalate zyaadaatar companiyaan karj ke paise kaa galat istemaal karne lageen
 At the same time, some promoters resorted to fake receipts to show the expensive purchase of cheap equipment due to this negligence of the banks and the banks did a big job of passing them without checking it
 rajan ne daawa kiya jahaan desh privet bank aisi companiyon ko karj dene se kataraane lage jahaan paisa doobane kaa dar tha lekin sarkari bainkon ne isse koi sikh nahin lee or lagaataar difolter companiyon ko karj dene kaa kaam jari rakhaa
 UPA and nda's weakness Raghuram Rajan claimed in a letter to the Lok Sabha committee that while banks were working on large scale lending to companies, the first UPA and then NDA governments in the country continued to delay decision-making
 is dauraan koyala khadaanon ke aavanton par sawaal khadaa hua, anya infrastracchar projects par faisla karne main deree hui or nateeja yah rahaa ki karj lekar shuru kiye gaye zyaadaatar projects yaa to shuru nahin ho sake, shuru hue to unki laagat main bada ijapha ho gaya athwa projects ko band karne kii naubat aa gai
 NITI Aayog too, recently, Rajan Kumar, vice chairman of NITI Aayog, claimed that former RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan is responsible for the decline in the economy in the last three years
 rajeev kumaar ne kaha ki vitt varsh 2018-19 kii pehali timahi se pehle lagaataar 9 timahi main darj hui giravat ke liye rajan kii aarthik nitiyaan jimmedaar hai
 Rajiv Kumar said that the decline in growth rate during the last three years is due to increase in NPA of the bank
 kumaar ne kaha ki jab modi sarkaar ne satta sanbhali, tab bainkon kaa enpie 4 lakh karod rupee tha
 But by March 2017, this NPA has increased to 10
 5 lakh karod kaa aankada paar kar gaya
 Due to this increase in NPA, there has been a steady decline in GDP during the three years and only Raghuram Rajan is responsible for this
 in aaropon ko sire se nakaarte hue rajan ne sansadeey samiti ko bataaya ki niti ayog kii taraf se yah bayaan bina homework kiye diya gaya
 Rajan said that when the exercise to improve the bad balance sheet of the bank was started during his tenure, some people held the central bank responsible for the growth rate due to vested interests
 rajan ne kaha ki vah chaahate the ki bank apane gande karj ko chhipaane kaa kaam band kare or jald se jald ruke hue projects ko shuru kiya jaae jisase bank karj main die gaye apane paise kaa ek bada hissaa waapas le sake
 But this work was not done by banks properly and the npas of banks continued to increase
 rajan kii is safai ke baad enpie kii samasya par ho rahi raajnneeti ko nai disha milane kii ummid he
 However, now that Congress leader Kapil Sibal and former Finance Minister p Chidambaram continue to claim that the NPA problem was exacerbated after the upa's tenure, the ruling NDA claims that they have inherited the NPA problem

 That he will definitely take her in his new film 'sherkhan'

 dashami ke din (30 sitambar) ko durga murtiyon ke visarjan par pabandi lagaakar mamata banerjee ne ek baar phir rajya main sampradayik card khilne ke liye bhaajapa ko khulaa haath de diya he
 Due to Muharram on October 1, it has been decided to immerse the idol on Dashami till 6 pm so that there is no confrontation the next day
 is par bhaajapa netaa mamata par 'muslim tushtikaran' kaa aarope laga rahe hai

 ''adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki mamata kii ashanka khufia input par aadhaarit he
 The truth is that the government's scheduled time for immersion does not match the traditional puja almanac (which states that immersion is at 1 after midnight
 30 baje tak ho)
 Questioning the Chief Minister being a Hindu, Ghosh called the ban as a Taliban decree

 Yeddyurappa said that there was no veracity in the allegations and that the congress-jds alliance was trying to lure the mlas of his party

 The Congress also said that Yeddyurappa is making a 'futile attempt' to destabilize the government

 During this time, he heard all the suggestions of Dilip Kumar and found that he was very important
 is dauraan shahrukh ne bataaya ki vah shridevi ko lekar yash chopra kii banaai film 'lamhe' film dekh rahe the jab unhen film bich main chhod kar bhaagna padaa
 Shahrukh told, 'I was watching the film, my secretary came and he told that Yash Chopra is thinking about taking you to the film, i got up and went straight to your office
 or film mili dar
 
 
 ' aakhir 'vir jaaraa' ke baad 'jab tak he jaan' banane main aath saal kyon laga die, ke prashn par chopra ne kaha ki is dauraan tamaam acchhee filmein banaai gayi or unhone sochaa unhen koi behtareen film banani hogi jo inkaa muqabla kar sake
 So it was late

 dilli ke siem arvind kejariwal modi sarkaar se sargical strike se jude saboot mangakar ghir chuke hai to congress netaa sanjay nirupam sargical strike ko farji bataakar apni party main hi alag-thalag pad gaye hai
 Protests are taking place against Kejriwal against Delhi and Nirupam in Mumbai
 soshal media par bhi in netaaon kaa majaak ud rahaa he
 There are reports that the army has cleared the government to make public the evidence related to the cosurgical strike
 ek angreji akhbaar ne bhi sargical strike se judaa bada khulaasa kiya he
 The newspaper has reported to eyewitnesses that the bodies of those killed in the attack on the night of 29 September were loaded into trucks and buried before dawn
 yani in ghatnakramon ke baad sargical strike ko lekar sawaal uthaane waalon kii bolti band ho gai he
 Opportunity to redeem in assembly elections Now the question arises whether the Modi government will make public the video footage or photos related to the surgical strike or bring it to the world through the army
 aane vaale dinon main upi or punjab sahit kuch rajyon menvidhansabha chunaavhone hai
 PM Modi is also preparing to start a vigorous campaign for the UP assembly elections on the occasion of Navratri
 agar modi or unki party bijepi is masale ko lekar vidhansabha chunaavon main jaati he to janata ke bich sandesh jayega ki sarkaar ne jo vaada kiya tha, use puraa kar dikhaaya
 Anyway, from the day the DGMO gave the press conference and informed about the surgical strike, from that time the government and BJP supporters started trying to make air in favor of PM Modi
 kyonki uri hamale main 18 javaanon kii shahadat ke baad pakistan ke khilaaf kadaa kadam uthaane ko lekar modi sarkaar par bada dabaav tha
 People were referring to PM Modi's election promises, reminding them of what happened to the 56-inch chest
 lekin ab modi sarkaar in sabooton ke aadhaar par seenaa thokkar kah sakati he ki usne shaheedon kii shahadat kaa badla le liya he
 The Modi government can make Pakistan look like Pakistan by revealing the evidence related to tamasurgical strike to Pakistan
 kyonki pakistan ab bhi yah nahin maan rahaa he ki bhartiya sena ke commando uske kabje vaale ilaake main ghuse, aatankiyon ke camp tabah kiye or bina kisi nuksaan ke laut aae
 Pakistan is trying to make this incident a second turn by making it a violation of ceasefire
 iske alaava kejariwal, nirupam, digvijay singh or pi chidambaram sareekhe netaaon ke bayaan se pakistan ko shah miltaa he
 Pakistan's media is leaving no stone unturned to demoralize the current government of India and the Indian Army based on the statements of these leaders
 is bahaane pakistan ke hukmran modi sarkaar ke daavon kii khilliyaan udaane main jute hai
 Neighbors have also received the support of all countries including the US, Britain and Russia for the sub-indian Army's surgical strike
 haalanki, pakistan is ghatana ko apni haar ke taur par dekh rahaa he, isliye ise sargical strike maanane ko taiyaar nahin he or baar-baar parmaanu bam kii dhamkee de rahaa he
 After the Uri attack, India pulled all the neighboring countries into its court and isolated Pakistan
 lekin pakistan ke prem main andhaa china bharat ko sabak sikhaane ke daanv khel rahaa he
 Dragon has also given advice to India and Pakistan to reduce tension through mutual talks
 strike ke saboot saamne aane ke baad pakistan puri tarah expoj ho jayega ki uski jameen par aatank kii fasal lahalha rahi he
 Apart from this, other countries will also learn a lesson from this
 aise halaat main agar modi sarkaar sargical strike se jude saboot saarvajanik karti he to use hi phayda hoga

 However the operating system is the same

 chaar rajyon main vidhansabha kii siton ke liye upachunaav ke parinaam aa gaye hai
 One thing is clear from them that the wave of Modi which shook the whole of India is not visible now
 bihar main lalu-nitish ganthbandhan ko kaaphi safalataa mili he to karnataka main bijepi ko karaara dhakka laga he
 In Bihar, this coalition wrested some BJP seats, including Bhagalpur
 is seat par bijepi kii haar isliye bhi hairaan kar dene vaali he ki yah shahar dashakon se jansangh or baad main bijepi kaa garh rahaa he
 Here other parties have to make a lot of effort to win, but this time BJP very easily lost this seat
 na to party ne koi dhang kaa ummidavaar khadaa kiya or na hi dhuandhar prachaar kiya
 The weak candidate and the leadership's distance from the public led to his defeat
 party ne vahaan loksabhaa kii seat bhi ganvaa di thi or uske baavjood usase koi sabak nahin siikhaa
 He did not exercise any discretion in the selection of candidates and did not maintain complete communication with the public
 iske vipareet lalu-nitish gathbandhan ne har kadam soch-samajhakar uthaaya
 He did not give tickets to a single minority for not allowing votes to be divided on the basis of communalism
 duusari ore vahaan bijepi main netritv kaa sankat dikhataa he or voter vartmaan sheersh netaaon se khush nahin dikhte
 In Bihar, a lot of talk has been said about the party leaders regarding the distribution of tickets
 aisa lagata he ki bijepi kii rajya ikaayiyon main ativishwaas kii bhaavana bhar gai he tabhi to karnataka main vah bellari gramin kii seat haar gai
 The Congress won this seat while the party was hoping that it would again be heading for power
 karnataka main to uske vidrohi netaa yediurppa party main waapas aa gaye hai
 Despite this, the party lost an important seat in the by-election
 yah party ke liye chintaa kaa vishay ho saktaa he kyonki vah rajya main phir se vaapasi kii apeksha kar rahi he
 It may be a matter of satisfaction for the BJP that it has maintained its dominance in Madhya Pradesh and Shivraj Singh has lashed the opposition party Congress and established its supremacy
 unhone apni pakad or majboot kar lee
 Similarly, in Punjab, there was a fight between the Akali Dal and the Congress
 philhal vahaan ke bare main abhi koi nishkarsh nikaalnaa galat hoga
 There is not much time in the assembly elections in Bihar
 vidhaan sabha chunaav ke nattejey bijepi ke liye khatre kii ghanti kii tarah he
 It is clear that in the Lok Sabha elections, where people had agreed to Narendra Modi, there was nothing like it in these elections but people are voting on local issues
 upachunaavon ke nateezon se mukhya chunaav ke bare main kabhi bhi nishkarsh nahin nikaale jate hai lekin phir bhi bijepi kii rajya ikai ko phir se sochna hoga ki kahaan or kya galat hua
 The influence of planets in life is considered to be very strong and if Saturn becomes turbulent on it, then the arrival of sufferings starts in life
 isliye shani dosha se peedit jaatakon ko shanivaar ke din shanidev ko prasann karne ke liye unka pujan or vrath rakhanavrat vaale din kya karen
 
 
 - After getting a bath in Brahma Muhurta and wearing a clean cloth and offer water on the Peepal tree
 - lohe se bani shani devtaa kii murti ko panchamrita se snaan karaaen
 - Then install the idol on a lotus of twenty-four teams made from rice
 - iske baad kaale til, phool, dhoop, kaala vastra va tel aadi se puja karen
 - During the worship, pronounce the ten names of Kanshani - Konastha, Krishna, Pippala, Sauri, Yama, Pingalo, Rodrutko, Babhru, Mand, Shanaichar
 - pujan ke baad pipal ke vriksh ke tane par soot ke dhaage se saat parikrama karen
 After this, pray while reciting the mantra of Shani Dev
 
 
 shanaishchar namastubhyan namaste twath raahave
 Ketavath Namastubhyam Omnantipriddo, worship till the last day, worshiping like Saturn in Saturn mantra for protection from the wrath of Saturn, Durva for protection from Rahu's mischief, Ketu in Ketu mantra for protection from Ketu
 In Samidha, Krishna should give 108 ahuti from barley, black sesame to each
 phir apni aarthik kshamta ke anusaar brahmanon ko bhojan karakar louh vastu dhan aadi kaa daan avashya karen
 Many times the opponents go so far in their criticism that the truth is left far behind and the narrator based on the lie just moves forward
 aisi aalochana main tathyon par dhyaan nahin diya jaataa
 We do not want to stop at all and think about what will happen to that third party in the criticism of the adversary, who is unnecessarily losing his credibility in all these, is crushing
 yah sahi he ki in chunaavon main chunaav ayog ne apni puri taaqat nahin dikhaai or kai jagah uske kaary andeh ke ghere main rahe hai lekin iskaa matlab yah nahin ki vah puraa kaa puraa hi kharaab ho gaya
 But this seems to be the case in the Varanasi Lok Sabha case
 varanasi se tej bahadur kaa namakan radd hone ke baad turant soshal media par yah chalane laga ki modi ne haar ke dar ke kaaran namakan radd karavaaya
 The Election Commission is acting solely at the behest of the government
 chunaav ayog puri tarah bik gaya he
 Unsurprisingly, but no one wanted to know the reasons for which the nomination was canceled
 9 may ko supreme court ne tej bahadur kii us yachika ko khaarij kar diya jisamen unke namakar radd karne ko chunauti di gai thi
 Now look and understand what was the matter, in the points- kisi bhi sarkari naukari ke liye jab aap aavedan karte hai to iskaa uttar dena hota he, isi tarah chunaav ladane ke icchhuk se yahi sawaal poocha jaataa he; "kya aapako sarkari seva se bhrashtachar yaa deshadroh ke aarope main kabhi barkhaast kiya gaya he?"khayr
 
 
 Whatever papers will be short for the nomination filed on April 29, the Election Officer (returning Officer) will ask the candidate the very next day
 30 april ko sambandhit adhikari ne vahi patr tej bahadur se maanga or samay diya 1 may yani agle din kaa, yah namakan prakriya kaa antim din tha
 Here one may feel that it is not practical at all
 to nishkarsh nikaalane se pehle jaan lijie ki ye tariken pehle se hi tay hoti hai
 Why the Election Commission should have changed it or Tej Bahadur should have given any relaxation
 
 
 kyon? kya ye hai-profile seat he, isliye? itane mahatvurna chunaav main vipaksh ko koi ummidavaar nahin mila, to aise main tej bahadur hi sahi vikalp the, isliye? aise sawaal bhar poochna kitna haasyaaspad lagata he, jawaab to honge hi kya!lekin phir bhi ham bina soche-vichaar yun hi sawaal poochhate rahete hai or sansthaaon ko badmaam karte hai, logon main unke vishwaas ko kam karte hai
 While walking
 
 
 dhyaan rakhie ki varanasi loksabhaa kii seat se kul 101 namakan daakhil kiye gaye the jiname se 71 namakan patron ko radd kar diya gaya tha
 No one considered it appropriate to pay attention to this fact
 chunaavon kaa samay he
 Election Commission in the circle of questions, but this time the Supreme Court has dismissed the petition, then it will not be questioned
 Just think! And yes, one more thing
 
 
 tej bahadur ne khaane kii gunvattta kaa jo masalaa uthaaya tha, usamen meraa maananaa he ki jis ghatiya str par shikaayat nivaaran system kaam karata he, usamen tej bahadur kii shikaayat kaa nivaaran thik tarah se nahin hua he
 In such a situation, a further question arises that the department which had fired Tej Bahadur for complaining, would he easily issue NOC to him? Maybe yes, maybe no
 aise main ek sawaal or banataa he ki kya hamaari chunaav vyavastha us antim vyakti ke liye utani hi sahaj or aasaan he, jitne daawey kiye jate hai? akhir tej bahadur to bas apane adhikaron ke tahat hi chunaav ladane ja rahe the? to is tarah sawaal bahut hai
 This is where we stop
 philhal to itnaa samajhie ki vartmaan samay main chunaav ayog ne niyamanusaar hi kaary kiya he
 Therefore, it would be meaningless to question his credibility in this matter
 rajasthan ke baran jile main apni patni ko ek baar main teen talaak bolkar usase rishta todane par vyakti par maamla darj hua he
 The police gave this information on Wednesday

 Yusuf said in a press conference at Karachi Press Club, 'I have decided to say goodbye to international cricket
 iske liye ve halaat jimmedaar hai jinase main haal hi main gujara hum
 The 35-year-old Yusuf was the captain of Pakistan during the recent tour of New Zealand and Australia in which the team suffered a crushing defeat
 iske baad pakistan cricket board ne team ke kharaab pradarshan kii jaanch ke liye samiti kaa gathan kiya tha
 The committee decided to impose an indefinite ban on Yusuf and Younis Khan
 un par team main gutbaji karke manobal giraane kaa aarope lagaaya gaya
 Yusuf said, 'the board wrote to me saying that i spoiled the atmosphere of the team in Australia, so i decided to retire
 ’ usoof ne kaha, ‘maine hameshaa desh ko apana sarvshereshth dene kii koshish kii he
 i do not want to be a problem for the team, so it is okay to retire
 ’press conference main kisi bhi sawaal kaa jawaab dene se inkaar karte hue usoof ne kaha ki vah gharelu cricket or videshi lig main khelte rahenge kyonki vah cricket se naata nahin todna chaahate

 After this, they keep an eye on their prey for a long time and as soon as they get a chance, they break up on their prey and loot things like chains, purses and mobiles and escape

 The money of such people will be refunded to their account
 railway ne saaf kar diya ki kisi bhi surat main paise kaa nakad bhugtan nahin hoga

 Hence this rule was applied only on cash tickets (purchase from PRS counters)
 khabaren ain ki log ghar main pade kalaadhan ko safed karne ke liye is prakaar tikat book kara rahe hai taaki tik cancil karakar use white kar liya jaae
