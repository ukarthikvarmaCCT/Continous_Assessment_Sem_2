 kaamkaaj main teji laane kii pranali par jor dete hue pradhanmantri narendra modi ne buudhvaar ko naukarshahon se kaha ki un puraane niyamon or prakriyaaon ko khatm karen, jo bhram paidaa kar shashan main baadha paidaa karte hai
 The Prime Minister encouraged him to take a decision and promised that he would support him
 pradhanmantri ne sabhi mantralayon or vibhaagon ke 77 sachivon or varisht adhikariyon ke saath samuhik baithak kar unase kaha ki ve suzav dene yaa kisi mudde ko sulajhane main unke hastkshep ke liye sidhe unase phone yaa i-mail se sampark karen
 An official statement issued after such a meeting for the first time in the last eight years said that during a two-and-a-half-hour long meeting, Modi patiently listened to the top bureaucrats and sympathized with their sentiments
 'paristhitiyon' ke kaaran unki sahi kshamtaaon kaa akalan nahin hone ko lekar unke kshobh par bhi pradhanmantri ne gaur kiya
 Expressing full confidence in the commitment and ability of the bureaucrats to improve the future of the country, Modi asked them to simplify and fix administrative rules and procedures so that they can be pro-people
 unhone kaha, aise niyam or prakriya ho sakate hai, jo puraane ho gaye hai or prashasan kii prakriya main suvidha kii bajaay ve bhram paidaa kar rahe hon
 He stressed the need to identify and abolish such old rules and procedures
 sabhi adhikariyon kii un tak pahunch kaa vaada karte hue, pradhanmantri ne unhen utsahit kiya ki apni soochnaaon evam vichaaron ke saath ve sampark karen
 The statement said that he encouraged the authorities to take a decision and assured that he would stand by them
 prashasan main zyada dakshata evam prabhaav laane ke liye praudyogiki ke istemaal par jor dete hue modi ne kaha, loktantr main nagarikon kii shikayaton kaa samaadhaan kaaphi mahatvapurn he or soochna praudyogiki se is silsile main kaaphi madad mil sakati he
 He emphasized on 'team spirit' and urged the secretaries to become the leaders of their team
 unhone kaha, samuhik kaary se hi twarit parinaam hasil kiye ja sakate hai
 Always offering to keep an account of his work, the Prime Minister said that in the process of governance, ideas should be converted into institutional form, as institutions live longer than individuals
 varisht naukarshahon ne bhaawanaaon kaa samarthan kiya or isi tarah kii javabdehi kaa swaagat kiya
 On the other hand, it is good with PPF that FD gets more interest here
 paisa surakshit he, lekin aap apni jaruraton ke hisaab se ise samay par nikaal nahin sakate hai
 The process of withdrawing money even on need is complicated
 sarkari bainkon or sarkari karyaalayon main paisa jamaa hone par thodi dikkat kaa saamana karnaa hi hoga
 But here is such an advantage that the money keeps appearing in the account with full and timely interest
 or samyavadhi puri hone par khate main ise lekar prayog main laa sakate hai
 Now it is clear that if you can forget for a few years by applying money, then there is nothing better than PPF and if you want to use this money at any time you need nothing better than FD
 ab yah saaf he ki paisa lagaakar aap yadi kuch saalon ke liye bhul sakate hai tab pipief se behatar kuch nahin or agar aap is paise kaa istemaal kabhi jarurat par karnaa chaahate hai tab epady se behatar kuch nahin

 The Government of India is going to release the list of states with good business terms for the first time in the history of the country by 31 August
 vaanijya mantralay ke ek varisht adhikari ne enditivi ko bataaya ki yah pahal 'mek in india' program ke tahat kii ja rahi he or is suchi ko philhal antim rup diya ja rahaa he
 According to a senior commerce ministry official, eight criteria have been set for the ranking of states, the top one being 'starting Business', followed by 'allocation of Land and Permission to Build'
 teesraa maapdand 'paryaavaran kii manzuri' se judaa he, or chauthaa he 'mazaduron se jude kaayade-kanoon'
 Number five is 'basic Facilities', and in addition to this, the list of parameters includes 'inspection of Factories', 'tax-related matters' and 'implementation of Governmental laws'
 vaanijya mantralay ko ummid he ki suchi ke aane se rajyon main pratidwandvita badhegi or ve apane yahaan nayaa kaarobaar lagane ke liye utsahit honge
 The comments darasal, yah pahal bharat sarkaar kii us ranneeti kaa hissaa he, jiske tahat puure desh main nae kaarobaar lagane ke liye maujuuda maahaul main aadharbhoot badlaav kar bharat ko manuphaccharing hub banaae jane kii yojana he, or iske liye behad zaruri he ki rajya bhi apane kaam karne ke taur-tareekon ko jaldi badalen
 The strategy is also to change the thinking of the officials working in the states, so that they do not create obstacles in the process of change
 world bank kii tazaa report ke mutabik 'aasaan kaarobaari maahaul' ke maamle main bharat philhal duniya main 142wein number par he
 The NDA government wants India to be included in the first 50 countries in this list
 vaanijya mantralay ke ek varisht adhikari ke mutabik rajyon kii ranking ke liye aath maapdand tay kiye gaye hai, jinamein sabase upar he 'kaarobaar shuru karnaa', phir number aata he 'zamin kaa aavanton or nirmaan kii anumati' kaa
 The third criterion relates to the 'approval of the environment', and the fourth is 'rules and regulations related to workers'
 paanchaven number par 'buniyadi suvidhaayen' hai, or inke alaava maapdandon kii suchi main 'factoriyon kaa muyna', 'kar-sambandhit maamle' or 'sarkari kaayade-kanoonon par amal' bhi shaamil hai
 The Commerce Ministry is hopeful that the arrival of the list will increase the rivalry among the states and will encourage them to set up new businesses
 tippaniyan In fact, this initiative is part of the Government of India's strategy, which plans to make India a manufacturing hub by making a fundamental change in the current environment to set up new businesses across the country, and it is very important that the state also do its work Change the way to do it quickly
 ranneeti rajyon main kaam karne vaale adhikariyon kii soch badalane kii bhi he, jisase ve badlaav kii prakriya main aadchan paidaa na karen
 According to the latest World Bank report, India is currently ranked 142 in the world in terms of 'easy business environment'
 endie sarkaar bharat ko is suchi main pehle 50 deshon main shaamil karana chaahati he
 Number five is 'basic Facilities', and in addition to this, the list of parameters includes 'inspection of Factories', 'tax-related matters' and 'implementation of Governmental laws'

 China's official media said this today
 ‘global times’ ke ek lekh main kaha gaya he, 'yah khedpurn he ki bharat-china ke sambandhon main sipiisi ek anya aisa kaarak he, jis par donon ke bich matbhed hai, lekin bharat ke virodh ke kaaran china dwaara sipiisi kaa vichaar chhod dene kii sambhaavna nahin he
 It states that, in fact, the economic corridor connecting the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of Northwest China to the Gwadar Port of Southwest Pakistan does not target any third party, including India
 china ne haalia varshon main bharat evam china donon ke saath nikat aarthik sambandh viksit kiye hai, iske maddenjar is baat kii sambhaavna nahin he ki uski donon deshon main se kisi kaa paksh lene main ruchi hogi
 The comments gauratlab he ki lekh main do baar ‘pakistan ke kabje vaale kashmir’ (pioke) shabd kaa prayog kiya gaya he, haalanki ek sthaan par bhartiya media reporton kaa ullekh karte hue iskaa zikr kiya gaya he
 (apart from the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it has been published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) An article in the 'global Times' said,' It is regrettable that CPEC is another factor in the india-china relationship, on which there are differences between the two, but due to India's opposition, China has abandoned the idea of CPEC
 Not likely to give

 With China developing close economic ties with both India and China in recent years, it is unlikely that it would be interested in favoring either of the two countries
 tippaniyan Significantly, the article has used the term 'pakistan-occupied Kashmir' (pok) twice, though it is mentioned in one place by referring to Indian media reports

 britain main european union ke kilaaf janamat sangrah ke nattejey or america raashtrapati ke chunaav main trump kii vijay ke baad to maan liya gaya ki das bees saal tak dakshinpanth rahegaa
 Only then do the results of the election come in the Netherlands on 16 March and the right-wing leaders or parties who talk like this lose
 7 may ko france ke raashtrapati chunaav ke nattejey aate hai or dakshinpanthi ubhaar ke jor pakadaney ke baad bhi unki karaari haar hoti he
 i am afraid that the political debaters should not start writing that right-wing is now ending in the world
 maikron maatr 39 saal ke hai
 For the first time since Napoleon, such a young man is going to sit at the peak of the power of France
 maikron khud ke bare main kehete hai ki ve na left hai na rhite hai
 The merits of both are a mixture
 aisa aadmi hota khataranaak he, pataa nahin kab left ho jaae, kab rhite ho jaae
 Nevertheless, Macros received 66 percent of the vote
 dakshinpanthi laa pen ko 34 pratishat vot mil hai
 In France, right-wing forces had never received so much votes
 macro globalizeshan ke samarthak hai
 The European Union advocates the continuance of France in the Union
 ve imigrent yani pravaasiyon se bhi nafrat nahin karte hai, trump kii tarah nahin kehete ki duusare desh se aane vaale noujvaan america naukariyaan nahin kha sakate
 Macron's wife Brigitte Macron is 64 years old
 maikron jab 15 saal ke the tab briggit unhen drama sikhaaya karti thim
 At the age of 16, Macron had decided to get married
 maikron jis class main the us class main briggit kii beti bhi padhati thi magar maikron ko apni teacher se pyaar ho gaya tha
 Brigitte also has three children from her first marriage
 maikron apane prem ko kisi se chhipate nahin balki duniya ke saamne puure aatmavishvaas ke saath haazir hote hai
 France does not seem to have an anti-romeo squad
 maikron or briggit ke pyaar kii kahani par hi alag se prime time ho saktaa he
 Unemployment was a major issue in France
 berojgaare kii dar das pratishat he
 One in four youth are unemployed
 iske baad bhi america kii tarah mudda nahin chalaa ki duusare desh ke log unki naukariyaan kha ja rahe hai jaise america main chal gaya
 President Trump speaks highly against the immigrant
 haal hi infosis ko bhi kahana padaa ki vah kai hazaar americanyon ko apni company main bhartee karegi
 There was so much anger against immigrants that Indians were also victims of this
 america main bharatiyon kii hatya ho gai
 It is generally believed that if the unemployment increases, the right begins to heat up
 naujavaanon ko rashtrawaad kii bhashaa acchhee lagane lagati he magar france main aisa nahin hua
 There is more unemployment than America, but right-wing leader La Pen lost to a new politician who was contesting elections for the first time
 jeet ke baad maikron ne kaha ki ve france or europe kii raksha karenge
 Europe and the whole world is watching us and waiting for us to come forward to protect the conscience at risk in many places
 unhone kaha, 'main puri koshish karuunga taaki aage se aapke saamne atvaad ke liye vot karne kaa phir koi kaaran baaki naa rahe
 Everyone was saying that my victory is impossible, but such people did not know France
 ' Macron may have received 66 percent of the vote but the lowest turnout in 40 years in the history of France
 ek tihaai matadaataaon ne to na maikron ko vot diya na laa pen ko
 One crore twenty lakh voters did not vote at all
 teen saal pehle tak france kii raajnneeti main unhen koi nahin jaanata tha
 After all, why did the people in France reject the right, and the liberal socialist Hollande
 ek aise netaa ko kyon apana rahanuma chun liya jo na left se aata tha na rhite se
 The 39-year-old fights the first election, becoming the President of France
 tippaniyan This happened exactly in March, when Jesse Klaver, a 30-year-old youngster in the Netherlands, stops the storm of politics against anti-muslim people from other countries for jobs
 wo paryaavaran ke muddon ko lekar jeet jaataa he
 Hearth Wielder was believed to be winning in the Netherlands, who was calling for the closure of madrasas and mosques
 netherland ke chunaav par duniya kii nazar thi ki netherland bhi dakshinpanthi netaa kii baton main bah jayega lekin netherland kii janata ne kattar dakshinpanthi party ko haraa diya
 Worth Wilder was a photocopy of US President Trump in the Netherlands
 ve bhi netherland kii simaaon par diwaar banane kii baat karne lage, unke bhadakaau bhaashan se lagata tha ki ab koi tark nahin bachaa he, janata pagal ho chuki he, usne sochna chhod diya he, use bas dharm kii baaten acchhee lagati hai, musalmaan virdohi baaten acchhee lagati hai
 Like the Macrons of France, Jesseha, the leader of the Green Left, openly said that he himself was an immigrant
 ve imigrent kaa virodh nahin karenge
 His mother is of Indonesian descent and the father is of Moroccan origin
 is chunaav main unke chaar se chaudaa saansad ho gaye
 Not only this, the right leaders of the Netherlands started talking about making the Netherlands great again
 thik jaise trump ne america ko phir se mahaan banane kaa naaraa diya tha
 In France too, right-wing leader La Pen gave the slogan of making France great again and French
 trump to jeet gaye magar netherland or france main mahanata kii dukandaaree philhal band ho gai he
 People understood that the slogan to make the country great is bogus and a leader uses it to make his shop shine
 france kaa nateeja bataa rahaa he ki badi sankhya main matadaata in sab baton se chat gaye the isliye vot hi dene nahin gaye or jo gaye wo jaanate the ki asli masalaa berojgaare he
 Right-wing leaders are avoiding the question of jobs in the name of religion and nationalism
 france main raashtrapati pad ke 11 ummidavaar the, inamen se akele maikron hi the jinhone globaligeshan kaa samarthan kiya
 Our country, our company, our jobs
 is tip kii raajnneeti ko jeet kaa formula maan liya gaya
 In any country where a leader is seen doing these things, the media starts to see the future Prime Minister or President
 sabko lagata he ki rashtrawaad kii jo bhi baat karegaa, janata bahekaave main aati rahegi
 After the outcome of the referendum against the European Union in Britain and Trump's victory in the election of the US President, it was assumed that the right would remain for ten to twenty years
 tabhi 16 march ko netherland main chunaav ke nattejey aate hai or vahaan is tarah kii baaten karne vaale dakshinpanthi netaa yaa dal haar jate hai
 On 7 May, the results of the French presidential election arrive and they are defeated even after the right-wing upsurge
 mujhe dar he ki raajnneetik charchaakaar ab yah na likhane lage ki duniya main dakshinpanth ab samaapt hone laga he
 Macron is only 39 years old
 nepolian ke baad pehali baar koi itani kam umr kaa noujvaan france kii satta ke shikhar par baithne ja rahaa he
 Macron says about himself that he is neither left nor right
 donon kii khoobiyon kaa mishran hai
 It is dangerous to be such a man, i do not know when to go left, when to become right
 phir bhi maikron ko 66 pratishat vot mili hai
 The right-wing La Pen gets 34 percent of the vote
 france main abhi tak dakshinpanthi takaton ko kabhi itnaa vot nahin mila tha
 Macros are advocates of globalization
 european union main france ke bane rahane kii vakaalat karte hai
 They also do not hate immigrants, like the Trump, saying that young Americans from other countries cannot eat American jobs
 maikron kii patni briggit maikron 64 saal kii he
 When Macron was 15 years old, Brigitte taught him drama
 16 saal kii umr main hi maikron ne shaadi kaa faisla kar liya tha
 In the class that Macron was in, Brigitte's daughter also studied, but Macron fell in love with his teacher
 briggit kii pehali shaadi se teen bachche bhi hai
 Macrons do not hide their love from anyone but present themselves with full confidence in front of the world
 lagata he france main anti romeo dal nahin he
 The story of Macron and Brigitte's love can only be primed separately
 france main berojgaare bahut bada mudda tha
 The unemployment rate is ten percent
 chaar main se ek yuva berojgaar he
 Even after this, there was no issue like the US that people from other countries are going to eat their jobs as it went in America
 raashtrapati trump to imigrent ke khilaaf khub bolte hai
 Recently Infosys also had to say that it would recruit several thousand Americans to its company
 imigrents ke khilaaf itnaa gussa bhadkaa ki iske shikaar bhartiya bhi hue
 Indians were killed in America
 aam taur par mana jaataa he ki berojgaare badhati he to dakshinpanth garam hone lagata he
 Young people like the language of nationalism but it did not happen in France
 vahaan america se zyaada berojgaare he magar vahaan dakshinpanthi netaa laa pen ek nae rajaneta se haar gayi jo pehali baar chunaav hi lard rahaa tha
 After the victory, Macron said he would protect France and Europe
 europe or puri duniya hamen dekh rahi he or intazaar kar rahi he ki ham kai jagahon par khatare main pade vivek kii raksha ke liye aage aaen
 He said, 'I will try my best so that there is no more reason to vote for extremism in front of you
 sab kah rahe the ki meri jeet asambhav he, lekin aise log france ko nahin jaanate the
 ' maikron ko bhale hi 66 pratishat vot mili hai lekin france ke itihaas main 40 saal main sabase kam matdaan hua he
 a third of voters voted neither Macron nor La Pen
 ek karod bees lakh votaron ne vot hi nahin diya
 Nobody knew him in French politics until three years ago
 aakhir france main logon ne dakshinpanth ko kyon nakaar diya, udaaravaadi samaajawaadee oland ko kyon nakaar diya
 Why chose a leader who did not come from the left or from the right
 39 saal kaa noujvaan pehla chunaav ladata he, france kaa raashtrapati ban jaataa he
 The comments march maheene main thik aisa hua jab netherland main 30 saal kaa noujvaan jesi clavar muslim virdohi, duusare deshon se naukari ke liye aae logon ke khilaaf raajnneeti kii aandhi ko roak detaa he
 He wins over environmental issues
 netherland main harth vilder kii jeet maani ja rahi thi jo madrason or masjidon ko band karne kii baat kar rahe the
 The world had an eye on the election of the Netherlands that the Netherlands would also be swayed by the right-wing leader but the people of the Netherlands defeated the radical right-wing party
 netherland main worth vilder to america raashtrapati trump ke photocopy the
 He also started talking about building a wall on the borders of the Netherlands, his inflammatory speech seemed to have left no argument now, the public has gone mad, he has given up thinking, he just likes the religion, anti-muslim Things look good france ke maikron kii tarah green left ke netaa jesiha bhi khulkar kehane lage ki ve khud imigrent kii paidaaish hai
 They will not oppose the immigrant
 unki maa indonesian mul kii hai or pita morocco mul ke hai
 He had four to fourteen mps in this election
 yahi nahin, netherland ke dakshinpanthi netaa netherland ko phir se mahaan banane kii baat karne lage
 Just as Trump had raised the slogan of making America great again
 france main bhi dakshinpanthi netaa laa pen ne france ko phir se mahaan or french banane kaa naaraa diya
 Trump won, but Greatness shop in the Netherlands and France is currently closed
 log samaj gaye ki mulkon ko mahaan banane kaa naaraa bogus hota he or ek netaa apni dukaan chamakaane ke liye iskaa istemaal karata he
 The result of France is telling that a large number of voters had lost all these things, so they did not go to vote and those who went knew that the real issue was unemployment
 dharm or rashtrawaad ke naam par dakshinpanthi netaa naukariyon ke sawaal se batch rahe hai
 There were 11 presidential candidates in France, the only ones being Macron who supported globalization
 maikron maatr 39 saal ke hai
 For the first time since Napoleon, such a young man is going to sit at the peak of the power of France

 ) sargical strike ke baad desh main mache siyaasi ghamaasan ke bich videsh sachiv es jaishankar ne aisa bayaan diya jise lekar sarkaar kii hi kirakiri shuru ho gai he
 The Congress has said that Jaishankar's statement has exposed the Modi government's lie on the surgical strike
 videsh sachiv es jaishankarne videsh maamalon par sansad kii sthaayee samiti ko jaankaree di he ki bhartiya sena isse pehle bhi elosi paar sargical strike kar chuki he
 But this is the first time the government has brought this action of the army to the public
 aapako bataa den ki pichley hafte hi raksha mantri manohar parrikar ne kaha tha ki bhartiya sena ke itihaas main pehle kabhi sargical strike nahin hui
 On the question of the surgical strike incident in 2011, Parrikar had said that it would be better to call those incidents a 'covert operation'
 vipakshi dalon ne pehle to sargical strike ke saboot maange phir aisa daawa kiya ki pehle hi sarkaron ke kaarykaal main bhi sargical strix hue hai
 After the Uri attack and the subsequent POK surgical strike, the relationship between India and Pakistan has been severed
 centre kii modi sarkaar ne pakistan ko alag-thalag karne ke liye ke liye maahaul banaaya
 Trade between the two countries has been affected
 aisa laga ki bharat sarkaar ne pakistan se saare rishte todane kii taiyaari kar lee he
 There is a demand for banning Pakistani artists in India after the Uri attack, but the Foreign Secretary has said that the contact between the common people will continue as before, there will be no restriction on this
 uri hamale ke baad na sirf kuch partiyaan balki manoj tiwari samet centre main sattarudh bijepi ke kai saansadon ne bhi pakistani kalakaaron ko bharat main bain kiye jane kii maang kii thi
 In such a situation, Jaishankar's statement against Pakistan is showing against the atmosphere in the country
 kyonki uri hamale main bhartiya sainikon kii shahadat ke virodh main indian moshan pikchars producers association ne pakistani kalakaaron par bain laga diya he
 At the same time, 'cinema Owners Exhibitors Association of India' has also decided not to screen films of Pakistani actors in Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka and Goa
 emenes ne to pakistani kalakaaron vaali filmon kii screening bhi rokane kii dhamkee di thi
 Congress reversed after the statement of the current foreign secretary, Congress spokesperson Deep Surjewalane has targeted the Modi government
 unhone kaha, 'ummid kii jaani chahie ki es jaishankar par unki purvavarti videsh sachiv sujatha singh kii tarah 'sach bolne' or bijepi ke kapat ko benakaab karne ke liye gaaj nahin giregi
 He said that the foreign secretary has exposed the eloquence, brag and bravery of the Modi government

 film:haidarkalakaar:tabboo, shahid kapur, keke menon, shraddha kapoornirdeshak:vishaal bharadwajrating:2
 5 Starvisharan Bhardwaj's film 'hyder' is an adaptation of William Shakespeare's play Hamlet
 film kii kahani ek kashmiri chaatr ke ird-gird gumti he, jiske doctor pita achaanak laapata ho jate hai
 The officers take people on suspicion to get information about the militants
 yah kahani ek bete kii pita ko dhundhane yaa phir unki maut kaa badla lene ke aasapaas gumti he
 Taking the story of 'hamlet' and filming it based on 1995 Kashmir is a compelling idea of vishal Bhardwaj
 yahaan hinsa he, ugravad he, log aise hi achaanak gaayab ho sakate hai, yahaan jivan bekaar he
 In a war environment, a sensitive child's mental balance is so disturbed that he begins to feel strange, he sees the ghost of his father, he moves away from reality
 vishaal kaa is par film bananaa nishchit hi ek laajawab idia he
 'haider' is neither about Hamlet nor about Kashmir, it is difficult to say what it is
 film sard kashmir ke drishyon se shuru hoti he, aise drishy jo maine pehle kabhi nahin dekhe
 i have seen Vishal Bhardwaj's Omkara, Maqbool and Kaminey many times, but 10-15 minutes between the film was diverting my interest
 phir maine khud ko kaha ki yah hamelet kaa sanskaran he or kai film dekhne aae log to is naatak ke bare main jaanate bhi nahin he, bas film ko dekhte jaao jaise ye chalati ja rahi he
 When i go to see an emotional film, there is no avoiding me crying
 haalanki is film main bhi kai rone ke seen the, lekin meri ankhen nam nahin hui, film ke kalakaaron ne khub aansu bahaae or darshakon ke liye kuch bhi nahin choda
 Except for Tabu in the film, everyone's acting is touching the soul
 shahid kapur haidar ke kirdaar ke saath insaaf karne ke liye puri gaharaai par utre hai
 The film showcases his amazing talent
 shahid ne sabit kar diya he ki vah behtareen adaakaar pankaj kapur ke bete hai
 Shahid's silence in the film, his anger, his madness will all touch you deeply
 arshia ke rup main shraddha kaa kirdaar bahut joardaar he
 He lived the character well
 vahiin, ek shadyantrkaari jija ke rup main keke kaa kirdaar kahani ke ek hisse ke liye bahut mahatvapurn rahaa
 When one or two characters speak in solid Kashmiri language in the film, it is fun, but why not all the actors were asked to do it, there is no doubt that all the actors are capable of doing it
 vishaal ke paas is film ke liye bharpoor masala tha, lekin uljhe hue or chakra dene vaale screenple ne film ko kamjor bana diya
 Vishal has always made films that connect audiences, but in 'haider, he considered the audience stupid
 thodi kahani ke baad hi flashbek, har chote baat ko vistaar se samajhaate hai
 i think Vishal should have shown some trust to the audience, people are not stupid, everybody understands
 film ne na sirf ek acha mauka khoyaa he, balki kamjor screenple ke kaaran dil chhu lene vaali acting, parfect coschum or production dizin kii bhi barbaadi hui he

 unhone kaha tha ki big-baing ke baad brahmad ke thanda hone par isi kan ke kaaran padaarth main dravyaman kii maujuudagi he

 raashid kaa kahana he, ‘sho main vinaa kaaphi mashhoor raheen
 He was nominated seven times to drive him out of the house but the Indian audience vote saved him six times

 There is no major difference between UPA and NDA for India's financial system
 2008 ke baad jis tarah upie ne bainkon se andhadhundh karj baantne ko kaha or puri banking main bakaayaa karjon kaa barood bich gaya, thik usee tarah aarthik growth tej karne kii koshishon ko dhahte dekh modi sarkaar ko bhi lagane laga he ki karj par karj dekar chunavi sambhaavnaaen chamakaayi ja sakati hai
 With the latest dispute between the government and the Reserve Bank, this time bomb trick has also started
 bharat kii chhadam bankinkag yani enbiensi (gaiyr bankinkag vittiya companiyon) ne pichley chaar saal main berok-tok karj bate hai
 The government, through the Reserve Bank, is going to tie the dues of the banks to the banks
 bainkon ke paas bakaayaa karj kaa baari barood pehle se jamaa he jis par ab nayaa ardex bichne vaala he
 Reserve Bank Governor should remain or go, but now the government has heard the decree that one-government banks will have to buy outstanding loans of nbfcs or give new loans
 do-bainkon par bakaayaa karj vasuuli ko lekar sakhti nahin hogi or teen-upie kii tarj par bainkon ko karj baantne kaa abhiyaan shuru karnaa hoga
 Knowing all this, why is the government putting debt-laden banks on new ammo? The government wants to avoid a debt crisis before the elections
 enbiensi yaa shadow bankingrag ne bazaar se bade paimaane par (commercial paper or dibenture) karj liye hai
 They are not allowed to deposit or raise
 ve bank va bazaar se karj lekar aage karj dete hai
 2 of nbfcs
 3 lakh karod ke karj disambar tak chukaaye jane hai
 Some major liabilities will run until September next year
 isi bhugtan kii aahat ke baad aktubar main bazaar main nakadi kaa sankat shuru hua ki kyon lendaaron ko yah pataa he ki shadow banking ga ke pair ke neeche puunji kii jameen nahin he
 The government's exercise is to advance the clock of this time bomb so that the elections pass well
 aisa hi upie ne kiya tha jab companiyon ke bakaayaa karjon kaa bhugtan taal kar unhen nae karj die gaye the
 On the threat of the government, the Reserve Bank has asked banks to give more loans to this shadow banking, guarantee their bonds and even the State Bank then nbfc's Rs 45,000 crore
 ke bakaayaa karj kharidne ja rahaa he
 Mutual funds also used to invest their cash in NBFC bonds
 unhen is shadow banking ga kii sachaai maaloom he isliye pichley do maah main unhone kaaphi bikwaali kii he
 That is, the responsibility of their outstanding debt has now fallen on the bad banks who have savings of crores of depositors
 rigerv bank ke enpie formule ke mutabik, enbiensi yani shadow bankimbag ke enpie unke kul udhaar kaa 5
 8 per cent while banks' NPA (11 per cent of total debt)
 8 fisadi he
 The fresh relief they get will be broken after a year, and then new teeth of trouble will have grown
 2022 se sarkari karj kii dendaree kaa sabase lanbaa kram shuru ho rahaa he
 That is, the government will either have to repay the loan (through treasury bill) from the banks or raise new loan to repay it
 is bich sabase badi chunauti yah he ki byaaj daren badaae lagi hai jo is sankat ko samay se pehle aamantrit kar sakati hai
 Elections are in front, financial crisis is visible to everyone, so there is no immediate demand or investment due to immediate disbursement of debt
 iskaa laabh kuch hi bade shadow bainkon (enbiensi) ko hi milegaa
 As in 2010, during the crisis on microfinance companies, other financial companies will remain in crisis
 vittiya tantra main karj mithkon ke rakshas raktbeej kii tarah hota he
 He just changes the place, grows, never dies
 bazaar ko yah acchhee tarah pataa he
 In large economies, such a debt crisis occurs once in 40 years

 i was told in the Indian Consulate that you go to Sacramento

 (input bhashaa se) (from input language) loksabhaa main charchaa kii shuruyaat karte hue pradhanmantri narendra modi ne kaha ki aaj kaa din gaurav kaa din he
 Modi said that this movement has been 75 years, it had great importance in the independence of the country
 angrejon ne isaki kalpana nahin kii thi
 The PM said that at that time it is necessary to bring the sacrifices of great men to a new generation
 jab is andolan ke 25 saal or 50 saal hue the tab bhi iskaa mahatv tha lekin 75 saal puure hona badi baat he
 August 9 was a big role in the history of the country, it was not imagined by the British
 us dauraan mahatma gandhi or bade netaa jail gaye the, tab nae netaaon ne janm liya tha
 Which included leaders like Lal Bahadur Shastri, Ram Manohar Lohia
 modi ne kaha ki 1857 se 1947 takaazadee ke andolanke alag-alag padaav aae, desh ke sabhi logon ko ye ghatnaayen yaad hai
 This movement paved the way for independence
 1857 kaa sangram desh ke har kone main ladaa gaya, uske baad mahatma gandhi kaa bharat lautnaa, unka dandi march karnaa, bhagat singh, sukhdev, raajaguru, chandrashekhar aaazaad or netaji subhash chandra bose ne isamen ahm yogadan diya tha
 With this movement, people started feeling that if not now it will never happen
 pehle kabhi lagata tha ki andolan sirf kuch logon ke dwaara hi chal rahaa he lekin 1942 ke andolan main sabhi kaa saath mila
 The slogan in this movement was to leave India, during this time it is a big thing to say 'will or will die' of Mahatma Gandhi
 us dauraan gandhi ne kaha ki main swatantraaa se kam par santusht hone vaala nahin hum
 We will either do or die
 piem ne kaha ki us samay samaaj ke sabhi varg jab is andolan main jud gaya jisase isamen teji ai
 Mahatma Gandhi had said that if anyone dies during this time, he should put a bandage on his body or he will die
 modi bole ki jab sabhi logon ne ek saath isaki ladaai ladi to hamen 1942 se 1947 tak ke andolan main hamen aazaadee mil jaati he
 The PM said that Ramvriksha Benipuri has written a book, Chains and Walls in which he said that every person became a leader, every intersection of the country became a do or die office
 mumbai ne rasta dikhaa diya, aane-jane ke sabhi raste band ho gaye the
 The people had taken the Gandhi-manti mantra of do or die into their hearts
 modi bole ki bharat ke aaazaad hone se puri duniya main bada sandesh gaya or un jagahon par bhi aazaadee kaa andolan shuru hua tha
 The PM said that the lesson for us is that when we move together, we can move the country forward
 modi ne sohanlal dvivedi kii kavita bhi padhi, unhone 'usee ore' kavita kii panktiya sunai
 PM said that today when we are in 2017, we do not have Gandhi, there is no leadership like that time
 lekin 125 karod deshavaasiyon ke paas ye kshamta he ki ham gandhi ke sapanom ko puraa kar sakate hai
 At that time there was a favorable environment for India and even today there is a favorable environment for the country
 bharat ek baar phir duniya ke liye prerana ban saktaa he
 Modi said that for us, there is a bigger country than a party, politics is a big national policy
 bhrashtachar ke dimak ne desh ko tabah kar diya tha, hamen is sthiti ko badalanaa hoga
 The challenge of poverty, malnutrition and education before us is the challenge of the country, not just the government

 The Supreme Court has ruled that if a husband goes close to another woman, he cannot be held guilty of cruelty on his wife

 The husband later had an affair with his colleague
 iske baad tathakthith rup se patni alag-thalag mahasoos karne lagi or march 1996 main usne aatmahatya kar lee
 "the court observed that the so-called extra-marital relationship was not such as to force the wife of the accused to commit suicide
 iske saath hi aatmahatya karne vaali mahila ke pati ne kabhi koi aisa kaam nahin kiya jo saamaanya paristhiti main patni ko aatmahatya ke liye uksaae
 The court also said that if proved, the extra-marital affair can be declared illegal and immoral
 lekin is maamle main yah sabit nahin kiya ja sakaa he ki pati ne patni ko aatmahatya ke liye majaboor kiya

 This Tu Lana is bitter, but it exists: Lalu Prasad Yadav and Nitish Kumar wanted Mulayam Singh Yadav to be Manmohan Singh of Bihar
 yani bagaiyr kisi haq or haisiyat ke ve bas naam ke mukhiya bane rahen
 In Bihar's "general Secular Alliance", every work was being done in the name of "netaji", the showy president of the Janata Parivar
 12 agast ko jab lalu or nitish ne apni-apni party rashtriya janata dal (argedy) or janata dal (united) main 100-100 siten bantee, baaki 40 siten congress ko deen or mulaayam kii samaajawaadee party (espi) ke liye ek bhi seat nahin chodi, tab unhone iske bachaav main apana jawaab bhi taiyaar kar rakhaa tha, “sabhi siten netaji kii hi to hai
 “SP is a weighty party in Uttar Pradesh, but it has always been a marginal player on the electoral board of neighboring Bihar
 narendra modi ke centre kii satta main aane ke baad bijepi or uske netritv vaale endie ke khilaaf sabase bada gathbandhan maane ja rahe nitish-lalu-congress ke gathjod ke bich is chunaav main sidhi takkar he
 But the captain, who watched the match sitting off the field, suddenly decided on September 3 that he had tolerated a lot and would no longer be in the alliance
 is faisle ne bihar ke is oonche daanv vaale chunaav main mulaayam ko unke kad se kahin zyada ahmiyat baksh di, kyonki ek to “moulana mulaayam” ke baahar nikal jane se is “maha secular gathbandhan” kii chamak feeki pad gai he
 On September 8, Mulayam himself attacked Nitish, "who is secular?" Those who ran the government with BJP for eight years? Did he suddenly become secular today? " Secondly, when the results come, the SP may not get a single seat in them, but if it reaches even around its votes a decade ago, then nitish-lalu's game can be spoiled
 sapa 22 sitambar ko bihar main apane chunavi abhiyaan kii shuruyaat karegi, jab uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav patna main ek “milan samaaroh” kaa sanchaalan karenge
 Although Mulayam had announced to contest all the seats in Bihar while leaving the alliance, but now efforts are being made to form a coalition of small political players
 rashtravaadi congress party (ensipi) jo lalu-nitish kii mahaj 3 siton kii peshkash ke baad naaraaz thi, pehle hi sapa ke saath aa gai he
 According to sources, Mulayam is exploring the possibility of presenting NCP Lok Sabha MP Tariq Anwar from Katihar as the chief ministerial candidate
 aisa hua to isse muslim voton ke ek bade hisse ko apni jholii main daalane kii nitish-lalu kii ummiido ko jhatka lag saktaa he
 sp's Bihar in-charge and national general secretary Kiranmay Nanda has also hinted that Lalu's elder political leader Pappu Yadav's Jan Adhikar Party may also join his alliance
 sapa ko ummid he ki tikat bantwaare ke vakt tikat se maharoom argedy or jedy(you) ke netaa bhi uske kheme main bheed laga denge
 In the four assembly elections held in Bihar after 2000, SP has contested more than 100 seats each time
 usne sabase achche nattejey farvari 2005 main die, jab chaar siten apni jholii main daal lee thim
 By the way, when the assembly elections were held again in October 2005 after just eight months, its number of seats was reduced to two
 sapa ne in donon chunaavon main 2 fisadi se zyada vot bhi hasil kiye
 However, in the earlier elections in 2000 and after that in 2010, she got less than 2 per cent votes and she could not win any seat in both these elections
 vahiin ensipi farvari, 2005 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main 31 siton par ladi or 3 siten jiti thim
 He got 7 out of these 31 seats
 2 fisadi vot mili the, jo rajya ke kul voton ke ek fisadi ke aasapaas the
 The NCP contested 8 seats in October 2005, winning only one of them
 in 8 siton par use 21
 68 percent of the vote, his share of the total votes came down to one percent
 2010 ke chunaav main jab nitish kii aguai main endie ne baari jeet hasil kii, ensipi ek seat bhi nahin jeet saki, par kul voton main uski hissedari 2
 58 percent
 yahaan tak ki jab bihar main 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main kadaa trikoniya muqabla dekha gaya tha, tab 9,000 se zyada yani 15 fisadi matdaan boothon main haar-jeet kaa antar mahaj 50 voton ke kareeb tha
 a more rigorous contest is expected in the next election
 agar isamen bhi vot isi dharre par padate hai, to sapa-ensipi-pappu yadav kaa jo gathjod banane kii koshishen kii ja rahi hai, vah endie ko satta se dur rakhane kii lalu-nitish kii koshishon ke liye khatra ban sakati hai
 The nexus of this nexus is on the same vote bank which has been a broken Janata family
 bihar main bilkul sir par aa gaye chunaav mulaayam ke gathbandhan se baahar nikalne kii akeli vajah nahin hai
 There are more compelling reasons
 inamen mulaayam kaa bihar main apni siyaasi ahmiyat bachaana shaamil he
 It is believed that his son Akhilesh wants to take the sp's cadre and the strength of contesting elections in UP as a rehearsal before the 2017 assembly elections in UP
 isse bhi zyada, ve rajya main apni party ke pair failaana chaahate hai, khaskar us vakt jab saamaajik nyaay ke suramaaon&67 varshiya lalu or 64 varshiya nitish ke aane vaale varshon main apni chadar sametane kii ummid kii ja rahi he
 sp's basic vote bank of Muslims and Yadavs is exactly the same as Lalu's in Bihar
 lekin argedy main duusare paaydaan par koi majboot netritv ubharta dikhaai nahin detaa
 Despite this, Lalu is trying to hand over his inheritance to his sons and Pappu Yadav is insisting on grabbing him
 aise main 42 saal ke akhilesh yadav ke saath vakt he
 Had these been the summer days of brotherhood in the Janata family, Lalu would have reiterated his kinship with Mulayam and insisted that the head of the bespectacled family leave the Sultanate of Bihar to his chief warlords
 sapa supremeo lalu kii sabase choti beti rajalakshmi ke chachia pad-sasur hai
