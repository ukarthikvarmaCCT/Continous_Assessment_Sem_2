 However, a few years have yet to go between the enactment and enactment of this draft
 food companiyon kii manamaani ab nahin chalegi
 They have to tell what is in their packaged food
 In fact, the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSI) has now made up its mind to rein in the messing up of consumer health
 ethesai ne bhartiya khaadya suraksha evam maanak (labling and disple) regulations 2019 ke naam se masauda taiyaar kiya he
 According to this, now companies have to give all the information in canned food packets or cans
 centre for science and envaryament main diarector, program, food sefti and toxins ke amit khurana kehete hai, ''upabhokta puraa adhikaar he ki vah apane khaane ke bare main puri jaankaree hasil kare
 In such a situation, this is a very positive step
 ab bas intjaar he is nae regulancens ke lagu hone kaa
 "actually CSE has been working in this direction continuously since 2012
 2016 main ethesai ko siesai ne ‚Äòfood labling clems and edvertisement‚Äô naam se ek report bhi saunpi thi
 In this, the issue of labeling in canned food and the misleading information given in advertisements was not only taken seriously but it also talked about what steps can be taken to curb food companies
 haalanki ethesai kii raftaar ko dekhte hue or kitne saal abhi upabhoktaaon ko food companiyon kii manamaani se guzarana padegaa, iskaa thik-thik andaja lagaana abhi mushkil he
 The draft has a deadline of at least three years
 ethesai kaa gathan, bhartiya khaadya suraksha evam maanak act, 2006 ke tahat kiya gaya tha
 17 years have passed since then
 is bich sehatmand khaane ke adhikaar ko lekar ethesai hameshaa sawaalon ke ghere main hi rahi he
 India Today's report published in November 2018, after the bitterness in kaur-kaur, FSSAI came into action and the draft came out
 kya-kya jaankaree deni hogi1- dibbaband khaane ke poshak tatv jaise calories, saturated fat, trans fat, milaai gai chini, sodium (namak) kii maatra dibbe yaa packit ke bilkul saamne likhni hogi
 2- According to the diet for which nutrient is needed daily, what part of it has to be written clearly in canned food
 3- rojaanaa jaruri poshak tatv se agar zyada maatra dibbaband khaane main he to phir packet yaa dibbe ke saamne vaale hisse main laal rang kaa nishaan bananaa hoga
 So that the consumer can understand how harmful this food is in health
 4- khaas tarah ke khaane se hone vaali allergy ke bare main bhi likhnaa padegaa
 Meaning some people are allergic to cashew while some are allergic to peanuts
 soyabean ke paneer se allergy hona bhi aam baat he

 Indian Boxing Federation President Abhay Singh Chautala has expressed hope that Indian boxers will do well in the Olympic Games
 chautaala ne kaha, ‚Äòek jamaana tha jab videshi mukkebaaz hamaare mukkebaajon ko halake main lete the lekin ab halaat badal gaye hai
 The world has recognized our strength
 hamaare ladakon se virdohi darane lage hai
 'india's Vikas Krishnan (69 kg), Jai Bhagwan (60 kg), Manoj Kumar (64 kg) and l Devendro Singh (49 kg) have qualified for the Olympics
 chautaala ne kaha ki unhen ummid he ki april main kazakhstan main hone vaali asian upmahadwipiya olympic kwalifing toornament ke jariye duusare mukkebaaz bhi kwalifai kar lenge
 He also hoped that some boxers would qualify through World Series Boxing

 ‚Äô Changes in FDI rules in e-commerce from the government came into effect from the first of February
 niyamon main badlaav kaa mukhya uddeshy i commers companiyon kii ore se die ja rahe bade discount par najar rakhana he
 Also, after the implementation of the new rules, no company can sell goods on its platform by entering into an exclusive deal with a brand
 iske alaava pratispardhaa ko badhaane or bazaar main zyada maukey paidaa hon iske kisi ek vendor se adhiktam 25 fisadi saamaan kharidne kii shart bhi i commers companiyon ko lagu kar di gai he
 E-commerce companies petitioned the government to extend the date of implementation of the new rules, but the government did not give any relief in it, taking no risk before the election
 taarikh aage na badaye jane kaa desh ke vyapaariyon ne swaagat kiya
 But meanwhile, the big question is, what will be the impact of the new rules on this fast growing e-commerce market in the country? Also, who will benefit and who will lose? Big discounts? E-commerce companies used to offer big cashbacks and discounts to customers to increase market share and GMV (gross merchandise value)
 lekin nae niyamon ke baad aakarshak dils par kuch brake lag saktaa he
 In such a situation, the customers shopping online may miss the big offers on the festivals in the coming days
 walmart, amejan jaisi companiyaan isse sidhe taur par prabhavit hongi
 The major reason for the fast growing online shopping trend in the country was that online customers used to get good offers
 ab agar achche ophers nahin milenge to nishchit taur par in companiyon kii bikri main growth kii raftaar mand pad sakati he
 Small companies that sold their goods on a platform would have to spend to increase their capacity because the condition of not taking more than 25 percent of the goods from one vendor could affect the sales of that company
 bhartiya companiyon or ofline bazaar ko isse phayda hoga
 Because there is not much difference in price, customers can turn to the market
 shopping ke badalte trend main sarkaar kii yah koshish kitna asar dikhaati he iskaa sahi andaja aane vaale tyohaaron par i commers companiyon kii ore se hone vaali billian de cell jaise maukon par milane vaale rispons se pataa chalegaa

 bengal tigers jald hi khatm ho sakate hai
 According to a recent study, the Sundarbans, considered the last coastal bastion of the famous Bengal tiger and the world's largest mangrove forest, could be destroyed in the next 50 years due to climate change and rising sea levels

" ''laurence ne kaha, ‚Äò‚Äòyah baagh ke liye vastav main bahut hi kam sankhya he

 On Sunday, after a gap of 28 years at the historic Gandhi Maidan in Patna, the Congress is going to rally on its own in which Congress President Rahul Gandhi is going to attend
 congress ke 'jan aakanksha raily' ko safal banane ke liye kaaryakartaaon ne patna ke sabhi hisson ko binar or poster se paat diya he or yah ab party adhyaksh rahul gandhi ke liye mushkil kaa sabab ban gaya he
 In fact, many of the banners and posters that Congress workers have put in the city show Rahul Gandhi in the avatar of Ram, with which a complaint letter has been filed against Rahul Gandhi
 iske baad bhi congress kaa ye poster hamalaa jari he
 The Congress has released a new poster which shows PM Modi as Ravana
 shikayatakarta rakesh dutt mishra, jo bhartiya jan kranti dal ke mahasachiv hai, ne sijeem court main ise lekarrahul gandhisamet, bihar congress ke adhyaksh madan mohan jha or party kaaryakarta vijay kumaar singh ke khilaaf pariwaad patr daayar kiya he
 He has alleged that showing Rahul in the avatar of Ram has hurt the sentiments of Hindus
 gauratlab he ki congress kaaryakarta vijay kumaar singh ke dwaara rajdhani ke kai hisson main aise poster lagaae gaye the jisamen rahul gandhi ko ram ke rup main dikhaaya gaya tha
 The disputed poster was also attacked by the BJP in gestures and it was written, 'keep chanting Ram name, Tum Bana Bana Ram Jio Re'
 is poster par madan mohan jha ke saath vijay kumaar singh kii bhi tasviir chhapi thi
 There was no controversy about the first poster that new posters have been installed here

 Coming in this poster that Rahul Gandhi is in the role

 In-charge of Bihar Congress, Shakti Singh Gohil has appealed to the common people to participate in maximum number of the rally on their own after 28 years of Congress
 pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar ke taur par narendra modi ne 2014 main vaada kiya tha ki visthapit kashmiri panditon ko nyaay dilaayenge
 The PM has completed a four-and-a-half-year term but displaced Kashmiri Pandits are still forced to stay in refugee camps outside Jammu city
 india today ke sunil bhatta ne jammu ke baahar jaagti rifuji camp kaa daura kiya or jaanane kii koshish kii ki pradhanmantri modi ne abhi tak visthapit kashmiri panditon ko raahat pahunchane ke liye kya kiya he
 India Today team arrived to take stock of the Awake Relief Camp, the walls of the flats built in the camp were chopped off and leakage was found in the sewer lines
 camp ke kai flats aisi avasthaa main hai jinhen dekhakar kaha ja saktaa he ki vah kisi bhi samay darak kar dhah sakate hai
 These flats in the relief camp were allotted to displaced Kashmiris in 2011
 2014 main chunaav lard rahi bhaajapa ne unase vaada kiya ki vah jaagti ke is raahat camp ko satellite toun kii tarah viksit karte hue sabhi suvidhaon se las karne kaa kaam karenge
 However, given the dilapidated condition of these flats, it seems clear that they can collapse at any time and prove to be fatal for the refugees living here
 beete chaar saal ke dauraan raahat camp main rahane vaale sharnaarthi lagaataar sarkari karyaalayon kaa chakkar kaat rahe hai lekin kahin bhi inaki sunwaayee nahin kii ja rahi he
 Some people in these camps also claim that the flats in the relief camp have been constructed using inferior materials, due to which these flats are on the verge of collapse
 kashmir ko nuksaan pahunchane main kaamyaab rahe 'patharbaj', kho gai 3 saal kii aarthik raftarahat camp main pahunchakar kuch logon se baat karne par pataa chalaa ki yahaan ke log modi sarkaar se naaraaz hai or unka maananaa he ki sarkaar ne unhen nyaay dene kaa vaada karke unase munh mode liya he
 a displaced Kashmiri Pandit Veer Ji Sambli said that after 2014 he had high hopes from the Modi government but like the previous governments, this government too has failed completely to give him justice
 ek anya sharnaarthi jyoti ne kaha ki kendra main modi ke netritv main bijepi sarkaar banane ke baad ve behad khush thim lekin ab sabase bada sawaal yah he ki narendra modi ne saadhe chaar saal main hamaare liye kya kiya? jyoti ne kaha ki unke parivaar ko narendra modi se badi ummid thi lekin ab vah sirf tivi par bhaaiyon or bahanon kehete paae jate hai
 Jyoti was brought to this relief camp when her father-in-law was murdered by terrorists in 2011
 jyoti srinagar ke hubbakadal kii rahane vaali hai
 Significantly, the construction of flats built in this camp was completed in 2011 and was allotted to the refugees
 flats ke nirmaan ko 8 saal ho chuke hai
 Due to the water flowing from the sewer pipes, these flats are on the verge of collapse today
 satellite toun banane or suvidhaon se las karne kaa vaada aakhir kahaan gaya?in raahat campon main rah rahe yuvaaon kii haalat or bhi badtar he
 Sooraj Sharma, who is living in the camp, has a question as to where did the jobs that he was promised in 2014
 aatankwaad ke brake se baar-baar tut jaati he kashmiri iconomi kii liflinais raahat camp main kuch makaanon main nirmaan kaary bhi chal rahaa he
 The residents of the camp said that recently the state government has approved the repair work, due to which the repair work is going on slowly in some flats
 flats kii sthiti par jab kshetreey adhikariyon se baat kii gai unhone daawa kiya ki charanbaddh tareeke se flats ke marammat kaa kaam kiya ja rahaa he
 The Jammu and Kashmir government admitted relief commissioner Manohar Lal Raina admitted that there were some issues in the camp but the repair work could not be started due to legal hurdles
 philhal flats ke marammat ke liye sarkaar ne 10 karod rupee kaa bajet diya he or kaam shuru ho chukaa he
 Politics is also being held on the poor condition of the relief camp
 rajya main congress party ke pramukh pravaktaa ravinder sharma ne kaha ki pakistan samarthit aatankwaad ke chalate kashmiri pandit raahat campon se nikalakar apane ghar nahin ja paa rahe hai
 During the tenure of the UPA government, many Kashmiri Pandit families were successful in settling back in Srinagar and about 3000 people were given jobs
 vahiin bijepi netaa ravinder raina ne kaha ki yah modi sarkaar kii praathamikta he ki vah jald se jald aisa maahaul paidaa kare jisase kashmiri panditon ko unke ghar bheja ja sake
 It has been 29 years since the exile of Kashmiri Pandits from the Valley has received only promises from successive governments
 lekin abhi tak unke punarvaas ke liye kisi ne koi sarthak kadam nahin uthaaya he
 On the incident of theft of property worth more than 1
5 crore from the house of MLC Manorama Devi, former Bihar Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi has demanded the investigation of the entire case from a different agency, questioning the functioning and credibility of the Bihar Police
 
 maanjhi ne kothi thana prabharee kii hatya sahit haal ke dinon main hui kai aparaadhik ghatnao ke liye bihar ke police tantra ke kaary style or vishwaneeyata par kadaa prahaar kiya he
 He has held DGP of Bihar and SSP of Gaya responsible for deteriorating law and order in Bihar
 maanjhi ne kaha ki jab police or prashasan ke saamne sharaab maamle main emelsi manorama devi kaa ghar sil kiya gaya tha or jab hai court ke aadesh par ghar kaa sil khulaa to pure ghar kaa sil tuta mila, iskaa matlab yahi na hua ki police ne hi manorama devi kaa ghar lutvaya
 This proves that Bihar's police system is completely unsuccessful
 police ek ghar ko surakshit nahin rakh sakati he to to bihar kii janata ko kaise surakshit rakhegi
 Manjhi said that the police of Bihar is no longer trusted
 is kand kii jaanch bihar kii police ke bajaay kisi bahari agency se karwaane kii maang bihar sarkaar se kii he
 When the seal house of MLC Manorama Devi opened in Gaya, Bihar, after five months on the order of Patna High Court, the land was slipped from under the feet of the police

 iske alaava gaayab saamaanon main ek do naalee bandook, ek rifl tathaa ek revolver bhi gaayab he
 The license of these weapons is in the name of Manorama Devi
 manorama devi ne praathmiki main yah bhi kaha he ki makaan sil karte vakt rampur thanadhyaksh ukt hathiyaaron ke license va kaartoos lete gayi the, lekin hathiyaar ghar par chhod diya tha
 Apart from this, he has also told the police about the theft of clothes worth lakhs of rupees from the house

 rahul nenotbandiko lekar centre kii narendra modi sarkaar ko gherte hue kaha ki pradhanmantri ke is kadam se aam log to abhi hi cashles ho gaye
 He also alleged that after this demonetisation against black money, only black money has become white

 ' People in three districts of West Bengal and about three hundred villages are troubled by the terror of elephants
 haathiyon kaa jhund aae din kisaanon ke kheton main ghus jaataa he or unki mehnat or puunji se khadi fasal tabah kar detaa he
 Due to this, farmers are suffering huge economic losses

 Rural Panchnag Mahato, who is troubled by elephants, says, elephants move towards the village every day after dawn
 wo na sirf fasal barbaad karte hai balki gaanvon main logon or jhopadiyon ko bhi kuchal chuke hai

 ' haathiyon ko bhagane ke liye bees se pachchis logon kii jarurat hoti he
 We burn the fire and drive them away

 Kharagpur Divisional Forest Officer Anjan Guha says farming and farmers are suffering the most from elephants
 haathiyon ke gaanv kii taraf rukh karne ke peeche jangal main unke liye paryaapt khaanaa maujuud na hona ek vajah ho sakati he
 There are about 200 elephants in this area of which 140 are nomadic

 Local farmers have been plagued by the terror of these elephants
 midanapur ke vidhayak shrikant mahato kaa kahana he ki samay ke saath log haathiyon kii samasya se nipatna sikh gaye hai
 Now whenever herds of elephants attack, people become more organized and confront them and are succeeding in driving them away
 log aag or pataakhen jalaakar haathiyon ko bhagaate hai
 The government has formed mobile teams and hullah teams to tackle this problem
 ham van vibhaag ke adhikariyon kii bhi madad le rahe hai
 Encountering elephants is nothing new to the villagers
 sthaneey nivasee ranjit rana bataate hai, saalon se yahaan haathiyon kaa aatank he
 Many have lost their lives in elephant attacks
 anjan guha kehete hai ki sarkaar is samasya ke prati gambhir he
 He said, 'we had planned to start Mayurajarna elephant sanctuary five years ago

 We hope to get the scheme approved this year
 or agle paanch-saat saalon main ham yah abhyaaran bana paaenge
 According to the forest department survey, 1 in the forest area in West Bengal
 3% kaa ijapha hua he
 However, it did not stop the elephants from entering the fields
 haathiyon ke badhate hamalon ke kaaran par charchaa karte hue anjan guha bataate hai, 'hathi padosi rajya jharkhand or dalma ke jangalon se yahaan aate hai
 We have also seen that now these elephants are also moving towards the neighboring state of Odisha

 His ministers from Bihar were also honored at the Bihar Samman program in Delhi
 nitish kumaar ko lalu yadav kii tulana main aise saath kii zarurat he jo daagdar na ho, bhrasht na ho, jo narendra modi kii raajnneeti ke liye chunauti kaa chihn ho
 Perhaps this is why the posters of Nitish and Lalu are not seen together yet
 kejariwal ne to kah hi diya he piem modi dilli ke chunaav se pehle kii galtiyaan dauharaa rahe hai
 The DNA fight is in full swing in Delhi and now in Bihar

 Kejriwal has already said that PM Modi is playing the mistakes before the Delhi elections
 dilli main tab gotra or ab bihar main diene kii ladaai joro par he
 By the way, Kejriwal also wants to spread his footing out of Delhi
 tippaniyan On the other hand, the BJP wants to cover many of its faces in the state behind Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who won an impressive victory in the Lok Sabha
 bihar ke liye sava lakh karod rupee ke package se rajya ke abhootpurv vikaas karne kaa vaada kar rahi he

 His impact in the Rajya Sabha and most importantly at the Center, because the functioning of his government has started to be questioned during the one-year rule

 koi kaam shuru karne se pehle, swayan se teen sawaal jarur kijiye - main ye kyon kar rahaa hum, iske parinaam kya ho sakate hai or kya main safal ho paaungaa? or jab gaharaai se sochane par in sawaalon ke santoshjanak jawaab mil jaaen, tabhi aage badhen
 5
 koi vyakti apane karmon se hi mahaan banataa he, apane janm se nahin
 6
 bhay ko najadik na aane do
 If it comes close, attack it, that is, do not run away from fear and face it

 Hair loss is enough to bother anyone
 logon ko yah dar sataane lagata he ki bal jhadane kii vajah se vah dhire-dhire kahin ganje naa ho jaaen
 But you do not have to worry every time your hair breaks
 american hair los association ke mutabik, saamaanya bal badhane ke cycle main roj har kisi ke kareeb 100 bal tuutate hai haalanki agar zyada teji se bal tuutane lage to yah tanaav kii baat ho sakati he
 Most people's hair grows by half an inch every month
 kisi bhi vakt par aapke 90 fisadi bal bad rahe hote hai jabaki 10 fisadi bal niskriy avasthaa main pade rahete hai
 After two or three months, 10% of these hairs break down and new hairs start growing in their place
 duusari taraf, duusare follicals niskriy pad jate hai
 Hair loss is different from hair loss
 jab koi bal jad se gir jaataa he or dobaaraa nahin ugta he to use hair los kehete hai
 People often have their hair broken in stressful situations
 new york main lenox hill hospital main dermatologist doris de kehete hai, 'lekin phir bhi aapako bura mahasoos hota he kyonki bal badhaane main vakt lagata he
 It may sound like a hair loss but there is no hair loss
 'cleveland clinics ke mutabik, hair los ke liye allopsia ek medical turm he jisamen keval scalp par hi nahin balki puure sharir par vyakti apane bal khone lagata he, haalanki ganjepan ke liye adhiktar anuvanshiki vajahen hoti hai
 Apart from genetics there can be many reasons behind hair loss - hairstyle or wrong maintenance of hair - many times people start losing their hair due to frequent wrong hairstyling
 kuch log baalo ko rabar band se kasakar baandhte hai
 Making ponytail from top or making ponytail also causes hair breakage
 iske alaava daai, bleech, stratenurs yaa permanent wave solution ke istemaal se bhi bal jhadanaa shuru ho saktaa he
 Depending on the amount of damage caused by these chemicals, hair loss becomes permanent
 hormone asantulan-mahilaon main berth control pills, pregnancy, bachche ko janm, menopause kii vajah se hormone main aae badlaav kii vajah se bhi bal tut sakate hai
 Illness or Surgery - Due to stress caused by any disease or surgery, the process of hair growth may stop for some time
 thoyrite disorder, sifalis, aayran kii kami yaa infections kii vajah se bhi bal jhad sakate hai
 Medicines or vitamins - Cancer chemotherapy attempts to kill all the rapidly growing cells of the body and in the process attacks the roots of hair
 hair los ke liye yah ek badi vajah hoti he
 Sometimes hair loss can also start due to the side effects of some medicines
 vitamin e kii adhikta kii vajah se bhi bal tut sakate hai
 Lack of nutrients - excessive dieting or lack of nutrients in food can cause hair loss
 protein, vitamin or minerals kii kami iske liye jimmedaar ho sakati he
 It is natural for children to stop growing as they age
 mahilaayein saamanyat: puri tarah se ganji nahin hoti hai
 Most of the hair fall in the front part of the head and hair near the ears
 vahiin purushon main maathe ke paas zyada bal jhadate hai

 In the bjp's vision document released for the Delhi Assembly elections today, controversy has arisen over the writing of 'pravasi' (immigrants) to the people of the northeast living in the national capital, and the Congress has demanded an apology from the BJP and to remove the words 
 bijepi kii ore se aaj jari 24 pannon ke dastavej main dilli ko vishwastareey shahar banane kii disha main aage badhane kaa khaakaa or janata ke kalyaan ke liye uthaae jane vaale kadamon kaa zikr kiya gaya he
 In one place it is written that the emigrants from north-east will be provided protection
 isamen purvottar ke 'pravaasiyon' ke sangrakshan ke liye sabhi thanon main vishesh prakoshth or 24 ghante kaa helpline number dene kii baat kii gai he
 Quickly reacting to this, Congress leader Ajay Maken said, "is the BJP trying to say that the people of the Northeast are not Indian citizens
" ' unhone kaha, 'bhaajapa ke vijan document main ek bindu he 'purvottar ke pravaasiyon kaa sangrakshan kiya jayega
 The term 'immigrant' is used when people move from one country to another
 maakan ne kaha, 'ham maang karte hai ki ve is pankti ko apane ghoshnaptr se hataaen or janata se maafee maangen
 He said that this document has been issued to the people of the Northeast with such a word at a time when External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj is on a visit to China
 maakan ne kaha, 'agar sattarudh party apane ghoshnaptr main is tarah kii chijen kah rahi he to sushamaa swaraj kis aadhaar par china se is bare main baat kar raheen hai ki kis tarah uske bal arunachal pradesh or anya kshetron main ghuste hai
 We need to understand this
 ' At the same time, Union Minister Kiran Rijuju from Arunachal said, 'this was a curcular mistake and we will rectify this mistake
 ' The meaning of fashion is now comforted, so keep traditional clothes for all special occasions
 lekin hameshaa inase bachaa nahin ja saktaa he or kabhi-kabhi jab special pahanane kaa man karata he to inhen dresses kii yaad aati he
 By the way, Punjabi suits and salwar are very much liked in the name of Khas and they also fit every figure size
 isamen aapke karvs bhi achche lagenge to baari sharir vaali ladies sahi fabric chunakar slim dikh sakati hai
 At the same time, many trousers look loaded in this dress
 jaanate hai inako kairi karne ke 5 tips, jo hamane fishan exparts se khaastaur par aapke liye jutaaye hai -1
 Kurta should not be too long Punjabi or say that long kurta with Patiala salwar does not look good
 iske liye kurte kii lambaai ghutanon se upar hi rakhen
 2
 sahi fabric chunevgar aapkaa figure acha he to suut-salwar ke liye haivi fabric chune
 If the weight is a little excessive, then it is better to choose light fabrics
 lekin net yaa tishyu jaise fabric aapke liye nahin hai
 At the same time, if you are very slick, do not sew the suit in cotton and chiffon
 3
 How are the colors, Punjabi suits look good in every color
 agar aap slim dikhnaa chaahati hai to marun, blue jaise dark colors chune
 If your figure is good and the color is also clear, then shades of peach, pink, soft blue, orange will be very easy on you
 agar aapkaa rang saanwala he to bahut zyada dark shed main suut-salwar na len
 4
 sleeves bhi luk nikharati hampunjabi suut ke saath aap kisi bhi length kii sleeves pahan sakati hai lekin yah jarur dekhen ki aapke body tip par kya suut karata he
 For example, if your arms are heavy, avoid wearing sleeveless
 agar patali hai to aapakai tarah ke dizinaajama sakati hai
 5
 kaisaa ho gale kaa stilyun to nek pattern kaisaa bhi rakhaa ja saktaa he or yah isi par depend karata he ki aapaki gardan kisi he
 For example, if the neck is long, you will wear both deep neck and collar shirt
 lekin gardan choti he to collar vaali shart na pahanen

 ' The case of re-verification of all passports made between 2001 and 2017 in Deoband by Uttar Pradesh Police has caught fire
 kai sthaneey log jahaan is kadam ko suraksha ke lihaaj se mahatvapurn maanate hai vahiin devband main kai log is muhim ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaa rahe hai or isse anayas pareshaan karne vaala kadam bataa rahe hai
 The BJP city president of Deoband gave a big statement about this campaign done by the police in Deoband and even said that Deoband is the base of terrorism
 'aaj tak' se baatcheet main devband main bijepi ke sthaneey netaa gajraj rana ne kah diya ki devband visheshkar aatankiyon kaa adda ban gaya he or pichhali sarkaar ke dauraan bangladeshi or pakistaniyon ke passport yahaan bana die gaye
 The BJP leader says that since 2014, he had demanded that all passports made in Deoband be verified again
 panchayat ke dauraan 'aaj tak' se baatcheet karte hue devband ke sthaneey nivasee rohit singhl ne kaha ki ye sirf devband ko badnaam karne kii sajeesh he
 Rohit Singhal says that passports are not available without police investigation
 agar pehle veriphication main galati hui hogi to police kii galati he
 People should not be disturbed
 darasal upi aties dwaara devband se giraftaar aatanki abdulla se passport baraamad hua tha jo devband main bana tha
 In such a situation, it was also feared that Bangladeshi citizens or external elements are living illegally in Deoband, who have a relationship with terrorists
 isi ke tahat police passport veriphication dobaaraa karne ke liye ek bada abhiyaan chhedane kii taiyaari kar rahi he
 As the matter was being dealt with in a religious way, we talked to Mohammad Sharif Khan of the Darul Uloom Zakaria Madrasa of Deoband who said on the issue of verification of passports, "the terrorists arrested are linked to Deoband
 yah baat to hamaare grih mantri bhi nahin maanate or yah kahana ki aatankwaadiyon kaa sambandh devband se he yaa devband ke madrason se he yah galat he
 "mufti Sharif Khan questioned and said," Was the passport made only from Deoband or were there other cities where it was made? " We have seen in the newspapers what he has said that re-verification will only happen in Deoband
 "police dwaara uthaae ja rahe is kadam ko lekar devband ke mufti sharif khan ne 'aaj tak' se kaha, "iskaa matlab yah he ki jo aapke vibhaag ke log hai unamem kami he
 The verification that was done at that time was not corrected
 jab pehle hi veriphication sahi nahin hua to ri-veriphication main kahaan se sahi hoga?hamane jab unase yah poocha ki aakhir police dwaara kii ja rahi is kaarywahi se unhen aapatti kyon he to is par mufti ne jawaab diya, "hamen aapatti kisi baat se nahin he
 There is objection to what you are doing with the name of Deoband
 agar bina naam liye aap veriphication shaq ke aadhaar par karte to dikkat nahin thi
 he was right
 ab aapane jab naam liya he to iskaa matlab he ki yahaan aatanki rah rahe hai, to yah galat he
 i cannot say whether i am intentionally targeting or not, i can say that what i have done is wrong
 "devbandpulice sutron ne ajtak ko bataaya ki abhi tak unhen mukhyalay se passport number or naamon ke saath list baraamad nahin hui he
 It is a big challenge before the police that if people present all the documents including Aadhar card and Voter card during the verification, then how will they identify the Bangladeshis living illegally because the possibilities are like that, they have passport like Rest of the documents should also be present
 police ke saath-saath sthanyintelegence unitaki team bhi ri-veriphication ke kaam main shaamil hogi
 Sources in the police say that during re-verification all the people with criminal records will be easily identified as their records are with the police
 saath hi videshi naagarik jo devband main rah rahe hai unki bhi jaanch padtaal kii ja sakegi
 Currently, the Deoband police has not reached the passport list for re-verification
 sutron kii maane to yah abhiyaan mangalvaar yaa buudhvaar ko shuru kiya ja sakegaa
 It remains to be seen how the police will carry out the re-verification of thousands of passports that have been built in 17 years, as well as how much controversy this campaign will create
 dilli ke kanoon mantri somnath bharti ne bhrashtachar ke ek maamle main sabooton se chhedchhad karne ke aaropon ko khaarij karte hue apane pad se istipha dene se inkaar kar diya he
 He has claimed that there is no truth in these allegations
 wo sabooton se chhedchhad nahin balki use or majboot karne kii koshish kar rahe the
 In fact, English newspaper 'times of India' published a news on Tuesday, according to which in 2013 CBI accused lawyer Somnath Bharti of tampering with evidence in a corruption case and influencing the prosecution witness
 is babat patiala house court kii vishesh sibiai adaalat ne somnath bharti ko fatkaar bhi lagaai thi
 Describing the allegations as rubbish, Somnath Bharti said, 'the news published in the newspaper is wrong
 yah puri tarah se jhooth he
 i do not know why the newspaper was in a hurry to print such news without checking the facts
 ye maamla state bank of mysore kaa he, jahaan 116 karod kaa ghotaalaa hua
 i was trying not to tamper with the evidence but to strengthen it while i was accused of molestation
 'somnath bharti ne kaha, 'export (letters of credit) se judi teen companiyon ne milakar march 2009 main state bank of mysore ko 116 karod kaa chuunaa lagaaya
 Officials of State Bank of Mysore continued to give money to these companies in the name of letter of credit despite not getting the permission from foreign bank
 jab nuksaan 116 karod tak pahunch gaya to vijalence department harakat main aayaa
 The bank's agms at that time were Manmohan Singh and BS Diwakar
 unpar bhi aarope laga
 But the bank's desk officer Pawan Kumar was implicated
 sitambar 2010 main pawan ko suspend kar diya gaya wo bhi bina kaaran bataao notice ke
 The vigilance department had directed the framing of charges against everyone, but it is not known why the CBI only accused Pawan Kumar
 2013 main maamle kii sunwaayee ke dauraan paanch tarikhon par koi gavaah nahin aayaa
 BS Diwakar was also a witness in the case
 isliye mere client pawan kumaar ne 16 farvari 2013 bies divakar se phone par baat kii
 i also had a conversation during this
 mere paas us baatcheet kii puri transcript he
 We wanted to bring the truth before the court
 mujhase baatcheet ke dauraan bies divakar ne kai chaunkaane vaale khulaase kiye
 We had applied to the court to bring this CD on record
 is dauraan sibiai ne pawan kumaar kii bel cancil karne ke liye arji de di or puri prakriya main us ahm sidi kii baat kahin dab gai
 Somnath Bharti, however, did not deny the court's reprimand
 unhone kaha, 'gavaah par dabaav daalane or saboot ke saath chhedchhad karne ke liye mujhe doshi maananaa galat tha
 The judge made a wrong comment

 After Kapil Mishra, AAP rebel MLA Anil Vajpayee and Devendra Sehrawat are also facing the threat of cancellation of membership

 Its back panel is curved and is better for holding
 haalanki chote haath waalon ko ise ek haath se handle karne main thodi samasya ho sakati he
 The rest of the camera bump is not so easily detected, as it is largely a difference
 lekin ek dikkat ye he ki aapako iske saath cover yuj karne kii jarurat padegi, kyonki ungaliyon ke nishaan aasaani se back panel par lag jate hai
 The rest of the phone is quite light, which is a good thing
 yahaan power batan rhite said main diya gaya he, saath hi rhite main hi sim trey bhi maujuud he
 Here only support is provided for SIM
 yani memory card ke liye saport nahin diya gaya he

 Here is the App Drawer
 software par ye smood he
 Only you will get lots of apps preloaded and you can get upset with notifications
 lekin acchhee baat ye he ki in saare eps ko aninstall kiya ja saktaa he
 One good thing is that you don't get ads like Xioami's MIUI
 yahaan aapako olves on disple miltaa he, haalanki isamen keval missd kol alert, SMS or clock dekha ja saktaa he
 Talking about performance, it is exactly the same as Realme X
 is smartphone main bhi Realme ke phone kii hi tarah snapadragon 710 procesar hi he or rigelt bhi vaisaa hi he
 Here things like app switching to multi tasking can be done very easily
 saath hi is smartphone ke jariye Asphalt 9: Legends or PUBG Mobile bhi kaaphi maje se khele ja sakate hai
 Talking about the battery, here is a 3,765mah battery
 itani hi bydaree Realme x main bhi di gai thi
 Talking about Oppo K3, it can be run for 14 to 15 hours in normal normal comfort
 saath hi fast charger hone kii vajah se 1 ghante main ise lagbhag 90 pratishat charge bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 In this case, overall battery performance is good
 camera:camere kii baat karen to yahaan Realme x or Oppo K3 main antar he
 Realme x has a 48MP primary camera in the rear, while the Oppo K3 has a 16MP primary camera, as well as a 2 megapixel depth sensor for portrait
 baharhaal iske parformens kii baat karen to yahaan focus main koi lag nahin he or camera fast process bhi karata he
 Photos come better in daylight, but there is a problem in low-light
 de lite main HDR or white balance bhi behatar he
 However, night mode is given here for low-light
 isamen kuch had tak photose thik hai lekin rijolution kam he or halki noiji bhi hai
 The good thing is that its camera clicks better in indoor artificial lighting
 portret shots kii baat karen to yahaan age parfections 80 pratishat tak sahi he
 But the skin tone seems slightly changed
 rialami phone vaala chroma boost yahaan daijal color naam se diya gaya he, isse color boost karne main madad milti he
 Also, here Google lens has also been added as an option, it is better
 selfi kii baat karen to yahaan bhi koi shater lag nahin he or portret main boke effect acha miltaa he
 Photo samples: Note - Photos are resized for the web
 Indoor lightingnight modenight Mode at extreme Low lightportrait shotselfiepesala:realme x or Oppo K3 donon hi lagbhag kaaphi saamaan hai
 However, speaking of Oppo K3 only, it is an all-rounder phone
 yani har aria main ye apni keemat ke hisaab se behatar he
 But if you want to select one between Realme x and Oppo K3, then you can create an idea by looking at the design
 donon kii shuruaati kramash: 16,999 rupee or 16,990 rupee he
 But Oppo K3 is getting 64GB of storage with 6GB of RAM, while Realme x is being given 128GB of storage with 4GB of RAM
 saath hi Realme x kaa primary camera bhi 48MP kaa he
 In such a situation, Realme x can be selected for more storage and better camera
 reating: 8 / 10 Newly appointed Governor of Jammu and Kashmir, Satyapal Malik has said that winning the trust of the people of the state and resolving problems related to regional imbalances will be his first priority
 satyapal malik pichley 51 saal main jammu-kashmir kerajyapalbanane vaale pehle raajnneetijna hai
 Significantly, for most of the time in Jammu and Kashmir affected by terrorism, only bureaucrats or retired army officers have been appointed as governors
 sirf 1965 se 1967 tak ke do saal ke daur main karn singh rajyapal rahe jo vahaan ke rajpariwaar se bhi jude hai
 Satyapal Malik was the Governor of Bihar before this
 unhone indian express akhbaar ko die ek intervyuu main kaha, 'yah ek chunauteepurn kaam he
 The basic challenge is to win the trust of the people of the state
 'satyapal malik ne yah bhi bataaya ki vah jammu-kashmir ke purv siem mufti mohammad said ke saath jude rahe hai or unke saath unhone veepi singh kii sarkaar main kaam kiya he
 Malik said, 'mufti sahib was our friend
 maine unke saath kaam kiya he

 'kshetreey asantulan dur karne par jorsatyapal malik kaaphi varisht raajnneetijna hai or unhone charan singh, veepi singh jaise purv pradhanmantriyon ke saath kaam kiya he
 The appointment of a politician as governor for the first time in the last 51 years in Jammu and Kashmir indicates that the central government is giving prominence to solve the problems of Jammu and Kashmir
 is bare main malik ne kaha, 'sanket yah he ki governor janata kaa hona chahie
 The Prime Minister has always been serious about Jammu and Kashmir
 vahaan ke vikaas or teenon kshetron main kshetreey asantulan ko dur karne par unka focus rahaa he
 Be it flood or any crisis, he has always been with Kashmir
 'gauratlab he ki jammu-kashmir ke teenon kshetron (kashmir, jammu or ladakh) ke vikaas main asantulan kaa masalaa bijepi kaaphi samay se uthaati rahi he
 Governor rule has been in place since the fall of Mehbooba Mufti government in the state in June
 is vajah se rajya ke liye mufeedjankaron ke mutabik ek to vah aresas se jude nahin hai or duusare mufti mohammad said ke saath kaam kar chuke hai, isliye ummid kii jaati he ki rajya kii janata main unki sweekaaryata badhegi
 He has been active in politics since the seventies and has lived in several parties before joining the BJP
 haryana kii jananaayak janata party(jejepi) or aam aadmi party(aap) ke bich loksabhaa chunaav 2019 ke maddenjar gathbandhan kaa elaan jald ho saktaa he

 dushyant chautaala ne sanket die hai ki agar kisi party ke siddhant unki party se mail khate hai to unhen us party ke saath gathbandhan se koi gurej nahin he
 Dushyant Chautala has said that he can ally with any party with similar ideology
 haalanki dushyant chautaala ne saaf kiya he ki ve kisi bhi keemat par congress ke saath gathbandhan nahin karenge
 The Indian National Lok Dal, the dominant Jat party in Haryana, has been divided
 gharelu party hi do alag-alag partiyon main vibhajit ho gai he
 O
 pi chautaala ke bade bete ajay singh ke beton dushyant or digvijay ne apni alag jananaayak janata party (jejepi) bana lee he
 The INLD mlas led by Chautala's younger son Abhay Singh are leaving the party and joining the BJP
 aise main rajya main arvind kejariwal kii aam aadmi party haryana main apni jameen talash rahi he
 If this alliance happens, both parties can obviously benefit
 congress kaa aantarik kalah bhi is gathbandhan ko phayda pahunchaa saktaa he
 Congress Party national spokesperson Randeep Surjewala, former Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda and party state president Ashok Tanwar have different clashes with each other
 surajevaala jind upachunaav main haar ke baad party netaaon par vishwasghaat kaa aarope laga chuke hai
 Amidst all this, Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is trying to gain a foothold in the state

 yani bahumat sabit karne ke liye bijepi ko abhi bhi 8 vidhayakon kii jarurat padegi
 But JDSK Kumaraswamy won from two seats and became an MLA
 aise main unhen ek seat se istipha dena padegaa
 Then the BJP will need 111 seats in terms of 221 seats to prove the majority

 Those who are absent from the House during the floor test can make the situation favorable for BJP

 Yeddyurappa hails from the Lingayat community and is constantly trying to sway the Lingayat mlas of the Congress through Lingayat monasteries

 unhone post kiya tha ki chennai ko ab sirf barish hi bachaa sakati he
 The seriousness of the water crisis in Chennai can be understood from the fact that political parties also had to protest on the road
 chennai main pani sankat kaa haal yah he ki logon ko apane rosemara ke kaam ke liye pani ke nijee tankeron kaa sahaara lenaa padataa he
 Now people will have to pay double the money for these private tankers, the private water tanker association says that it is justified to increase the money because they have to go far to fill the water
 vahaan kii sarkaar yah nahin bataati ki kya ve sabhi rohingya musalamaanon ko aatankwaadi maanati he
 The Government of Myanmar itself says that the Saudi jihadists help the Rohingya terrorist organization
 ab ye koi nahin poochta ki ye saudi jihadi koun hai, kya inhen saudi arab main panaah milti he jo myanmar ke is garib ilaake main aakar aatankwaad failaa rahe hai
 Then why does the world not talk to that Saudi Arabia, with whom every other day, some nation stands for the major business
 zaahir he myanmar kaa yah bahaanaa he
 The government there should say whether they consider all 11 lakh Rohingya Muslims as terrorists
 gardian telegraph neuyark times jaise antarrashtriya akhbaaron main bangladesh kii seemaa se kaaphi reporting hui he
 Rohingya Muslims who have come to save their lives have told how the army is encircling the villages and burning them

 The government and Aung San Suu Kyi say that these organizations are spreading terrorism
 bhukhe pyaason ko khaanaa or dawa dekar duniya main aatankwaad failata he yaa bandook or bam dekar failata he
 Suu Kyi should tell who is giving weapons to the Rohingya liberation army

 The Rohingya are not only caught in the battle of 'army versus Rohingya', they have also been exposed to communal violence with Buddhist society

 To surround and kill them, the Myanmar government has removed a large number of people from the Buddhist community from there
 myanmar lagaataar rohingya musalamaanon ko gher kar maar rahaa he

 Rana Dasgupta of the Buddhist Hindu Christianity Council, a Bangladesh Hindu, has said that about 510 Hindus have taken refuge in Bangladesh's Cox's Bazar
 jis desh main maanavadhikaar kaa record karaab hota he, vahaan janata maari jaati he, hindu or musalmaan hi nahin, jisaki baari aati he sarkaar kuchal detii he
 That is why we have to decide whether to look at the Rohingya Muslims of Myanmar from the point of view of Muslims or from the point of view of human rights
 kya ham ab itane sampradayik ho chuke hai ki is baat se fark hi nahin padegaa ki kisi desh kii sena aam nagarikon ko gher kar yun hi goliyon se uda de rahi he
 Rohingya Muslims do not even have citizenship

 aaj tak unki santanon ko naagarikta nahin mili he
 They are undergoing terrible exploitation and torture

 The comments sharnaarthiyon ko dekhne kii samasya par sampradayik rang bharat hi nahin duniya ke kai deshon main chadha diya jaataa he
 Instead of speaking out against violence, this violence secretly serves to feed communal thinking
 jaise aap dekhenge ki bheetar-bheetar pakistan or bangladesh main hinduon ke prati hinsa par zehar failaayaa jayega
 But there will be no statement from the level of any minister or prime minister about it
 ham chahen to ise aise hi dekhte rah sakate hai lekin thodaa badlaav kar dekhenge ki har sarkaar ke neeche har samudaay maaraa ja rahaa he
 The attacks on Shias in Pakistan are no less terrible
 badi sankhya main shiya doctoron ko maar diya gaya he
 There is a debate in many countries of the world about the issue of giving refuge to refugees
 france, america or germany tak
 Germany has given refuge to millions of refugees
 bharat main 40,000 rohingya musalmaan rah rahe hai
 There is a dispute over Minister of State for Home Kiran Rijiju's statement that these are illegal and should be thrown out
 jabaki disha-nirdesh yah kehete hai ki jo bhi dharmik pratadna kaa shikaar hokar aayega use sharnarth kaa darja diya jayega
 International newspapers such as the Guardian Telegraph New York Times have reported much from the Bangladesh border
 jaan bachaakar aae rohingya musalamaanon ne bataaya he ki kis tarah sena gaanvon ko gher kar jala de rahi he
 He is firing bullets from a helicopter
 bacchon ko maar rahi he
 Myanmar's government has prevented poor Rohingya from reaching all kinds of help to Muslims
 sarkaar or ang saan su chi kaa kahana he ki ye sanghathan aatankwaad failaa rahe hai
 Terrorism spreads in the world by giving food and medicine to hungry thirsts or by giving guns and bombs
 su chi ko bataanaa chahie ki rohingya mukti sena ko hathiyaar koun desh de rahaa he
 This violence has also brought a violent face of Buddhist society as a symbol of peace and logic
 rohingya sirf 'sena banaam rohingya' kii ladaai main nahin fanse hai, ve buddha samaaj ke saath sampradayik hinsa ke bhi bhent chadhe hai
 a riot broke out after the rape and murder of a Rohingya woman in 2012, when one and a quarter million Rohingya Muslims had to flee the country

 Myanmar continues to surround and kill Rohingya Muslims
 aap samaj rahe hai ki vahaan maujuud hinduon ke saath kuch nahin ho rahaa hoga to galat he
 The Indian Express reported that 86 Hindus along with Muslims have been killed on August 27 and 28
 bangladesh hindu, buddhist, chrishchiyan unity council ke rana dasgupta ne kaha he ki kareeb 510 hinduon ne bangladesh ke kaks bazaar main sharan lee he
 In a country where the record of human rights is poor, people are killed, not only Hindus and Muslims, whose turn the government crushes
 isliye tay karnaa hoga ki hamen myanmar ke rohingya musalamaanon ko sirf musalamaanon kii nazar se dekhnaa he yaa maanavadhikaar kii nazar se
 Have we become so communal now that there will be no difference in the fact that the army of a country is surrounded by ordinary citizens and blasts it with bullets
 rohingya musalamaanon ko naagarikta bhi hasil nahin he
 The law there would give citizenship to the same Rohingya Muslim who would prove that his great-grandfather came to Myanmar before 1823
 kya koi do sadi pehle kaa record dekar sabit kar saktaa he
 Apparently the government there wants to eliminate this part of the population by killing it

 Our Prime Minister is in Myanmar for the second time

 Till date their children have not got citizenship
 ve bhayanak shoshan or yaatnaaon se guzar rahe hai
 Therefore, we not only need to understand Burma's political developments properly but we should also give moral support to the ongoing struggles for democratic rights there
 sanyukt raashtra sangh ke purv mahasachiv kophi annan ne rohingya musalamaanon par ek report taiyaar kii he

 Why haven't you condemned it yet? america ke videsh sachiv boris johnson ne ang saan su chi ko chetavanee di he ki ve rohingya musalamaanon tak madad pahunchane se roak kar acha nahin kar kar rahi hai
 No Nobel Prize winners have written to the Nobel Committee to withdraw the Nobel Prize given to Aung San Suu Kyi

 hinsa ke khilaaf bolne ke bajaae yahi hinsa chupake-chupake sampradayik soch ko khuraaq pahunchane ke kaam aati he
 As you will see, within Pakistan and Bangladesh, violence against Hindus will be poisoned
 magar ise lekar koi mantri yaa pradhanmantri ke str se bayaan nahin aayega
 If we want, we can continue to see it like this, but we will see a little change that every community is being killed under every government
 pakistan main shiyaon par jo hamale hue hai ve bhi kam bhayanak nahin hai
 a large number of Shia doctors have been killed
 duniya ke kai deshon main sharnaarthiyon ko sharan dene ke maamle main bahes chal rahi he

 Agreeing with the idea of the controversial Sriram Sena chief Pramod Muthalik, PWD Minister Sudin Dhavalikar said, "girls' pubs in short dresses are not suitable for our culture
 agar ham ise manjuuri dete hai to hamaare goa kii samskruti kaa kya hoga
 Girls going to pubs in short dresses reflects the wrong culture and should be discontinued

 ' westeindies main durvyavhaar maamle main fanse bhartiya team ke manager sunil subrahmanyam ko swadesh lautne ke liye kaha gaya he
 Subrahmanyam faced criticism for his poor behavior during Australia's Perth Test in December 2018, although he survived there later
 ab dekhnaa hoga ki subrahmanyam ko prashasnic prabandhak ke saakshaatkaar ke liye 16 agast ko mumbai main pesh hone kaa mauka milegaa yaa nahin, jinhen chantni ke baad iske liye chunaa gaya tha
 a board official told IANS that it is necessary for the role of the manager to see if he will be allowed or will he be removed from the post
 yah is cheez par nirbhar karata he ki unke swadesh lautne ke baad adhikari unke tark ko kis tarah se lete hai
 But this is not the first time when it comes to misconduct against him as an Indian team manager
 bataaya jaataa he ki tamilnadu ke purv spinner ne guyana or trinidad evam tobago main bhartiya ucchayog ke adhikariyon ke saath kathith durvyavhaar ke liye bina shart maafee kii peshkash kii, lekin is ghatana se unka rashtriya team ke saath yah pad ganvaana nishchit he

 is shooting ke samaapt hone par unhen ek i-mail bheja gaya, jisamen unhen pehali flite lekar waapas lautne ko kaha gaya
 The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) had asked two High Commission to contact the team manager Subrahmanyam for the advertisement to be filmed in the Caribbean , but when the officials of the Indian High Commission in Trinidad and Tobago contacted Subrahmanyam They did not pay attention to the authorities
 ravichandran aswin ke purv coach subrahmanyam ne 74 pratham shrenee match khele hai or 285 wicket nikaale hai
 Earlier, a BCCI executive said that earlier such activities were ignored, which is why this situation has arisen
 unhone kaha ki agar baat ucchayog kii nahin hoti or sioe ke mukhiya vinod raay par aanch nahin aati, to is baar bhi is ghatana ko nazarandaaj kiya jaataa
 He said, 'such acts had happened earlier, but they were ignored
 isi kaaran unka hausala badha he
 Now because the matter has come to the opinion then action can be taken
 ' vishwa cap ke dauraan bhi board ke adhikari unke vyavhaar se khush nahin the
 It is learned that Subrahmanyam attributed the stress to his alleged misconduct
 adhikari ne kaha, 'apane maafeename main unhone kaha ki unki neend puri nahin hui thi or vah tanaav main the, jisase vah is tarah kaa vyavhaar kar baithe
 He has apologized unconditionally
 lekin aapako samajhnaa hoga ki yah maamla sarkaar ke ucch str ke adhikariyon ke paas pahunch gaya he or bisisiai is maamle par zyada kuch nahin kar saktaa
 'it is noteworthy that 52-year-old Subrahmanyam was accused of continuously ignoring the calls of senior government officials
 phir unhone bisisiai adhikariyon ke phone bhi nahin uthaae
 It is said that a senior person from the Indian High Commission in Trinidad and Tobago asked for his cooperation, and he told him not to send me repeated messages

 Pokhari village in Maharashtra was declared open defecation free a year ago, where some other backward castes also live and claim that they are forced to defecate in the open, because they have to build toilets The money has not yet been received
 pokhari ke bahari hisse main rahane vaali ganga saay aanshik rup se lakwagrast he
 Their only wish is to have a toilet in their house so that they do not have to go for open defecation
 gaanv ko pradhanmantri narendra modi ke mahatvakankshi svachh bharat mishan ke tahat gat varsh khule main shouch se mukt ghoshit kiya gaya tha
 However, Say and some other backward caste families living at the end of the village claim that they are still denied toilet facilities

 unki ekmaatr ichha yah he ki unke ghar main bhi shauchalay ho taaki unhen khule main shouch ke liye nahin janaa pade

 haalanki saay or gaanv ke aakhri chor par rahane vaale pichhadi jati ke kuch anya pariwaron kaa daawa he ki ve abhi bhi shauchalay kii suvidha se vanchit hai
 The comments saay kahati hai, 'oonchi jati ke kisaanon ne apane gharon main shauchalay banavaa liye hai, lekin ham khud se shauchalay nahin bana sakate
 'however, Sarpanch Amol Kakade dismissed these claims, saying that 47 families living in the said township had actually encroached on government land and were not considered part of the village

 Like every kinsman, son-in-law also has two types
 ek good damaad or ek bed damaad
 While praising a good son-in-law, the Prime Minister has pointed to a bad son-in-law, then questions have arisen as to what his standards are on corruption and familism if it is a matter of a son-in-law
 unhone kya alag kiya he
 Familyism is an evergreen topic of politics, things only happen on this, nothing happens
 girdharilal dogra, jammu-kashmir main 27 saal tak vitt mantri rahe or 26 baar bajet pesh karne kaa mauka mila
 Senior BJP leader and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley is the son-in-law of Girdhari Lal Dogra, who lives in the National Conference and Congress
 girdharilal dogra kii janmashatabdi kaarykram main pradhanmantri modi, vitt mantri jetali, mukhyamantri mufti mohammad said or congress netaa gulam nabi azaad ne bhi shirkat kii
 Such a meeting on the birth centenary of a Congress leader is a rare and happy moment of politics, but if Finance Minister Arun Jaitley was not the son-in-law of Girdhari Lalji, what would have been such a confluence
 congress netaa gulam nabi azaad ne kaha ki sadaa congressi rahe girdharilal dogra ji 26 bajet pesh karne ke baad bhi apane liye ek ghar nahin bana sake
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi said one thing neither Girdhari Lal ji asked his son-in-law to change his ideology to his court, nor did the son-in-law use any influence of his father-in-law
 donon apane apane karmon se alag-alag raste par chale
 While saying this, the Prime Minister said lightly that today we know what things happen due to sons-in-law
 sab hans to pade lekin congress ko laga ki pradhanmantri ne robert wadra par tippanee kii he
 The matter reached familism just as rescue and attack began
 shakeel ahamed ne kah diya ki vyaktigat baat nahin kerani chahie
 Modi ji will also be somebody's son-in-law
 usase pehle pradhanmantri ne kaha ki girdharilal dogra par lage chitron main ek bhi tasviir main unka parivaar nahin he
 The family appears only in the funeral photo
 yah baat unke man ko chhu gai
 i want to comment on this matter of the Prime Minister
 kya hamane maan liya he ki adarsh netaa vahi he jo apane parivaar ko dur rakhata he
 Where and when it has been proven
 is lihaaz se raashtrapati obama to bahut bure honge jo apane pariwaron ke saath saarvajanik rup se dikhte hai
 It is a strange argument to consider politics as retirement
 america main purv raashtrapati bill clinton kii patni hillari clinton raashtrapati ke chunaav main utarane ja rahi hai
 Bush has come from the dynasty to become another president
 nae vaale kaa naam he jaib bush
 Familyism has become a canker in every democracy
 in pidiyon ke sahare netaaon or karporate kaa rishta bhi khandaani level par chalane laga he
 If everyone believes that familyism is canker then there is courage in our leaders or parties to open front against familyism or son-in-law
 sab is mudde ko paal poskar rakhte hai taaki kamazor vakt main dhela maarane ke kaam aae
 Our democracy has come under the grip of a few families
 yah ek badi samasya to he lekin parivaarwaad kaa matlab bhi khulkar samaj lenaa chahie
 The foundation of familyism only khandaani or koon ke rishton par aadhaarit nahin hoti
 Sometimes a family relationship is formed due to business and friendly reasons
 jaise lalit modi ke saath sushamaa swaraj or vasundhara raaje kaa paariwarik sambandhakai baar udyog ke kuch hisson kaa sarkaar par itnaa prabhaav dikhne lagata he ki ham ise parivaar kii jagah kroni capitalism bataane lagate hai
 Crony capitalism means control of capital and power of a group of people rabart wadra ek misaal hai to endie van ke time vaajapeyi ke damaad kaa naam bhi aise prasangon main liya jaataa tha
 In the scam like Vyapam, a different kind of familyism is seen, then in the 2G scam you have seen a special kind of familyism
 isi saat april ko hindu akhbaar main rukmani shrinivasana ne apni report main likhaa tha ki hamaare 130 saansad raajnneetik khandaanon se aate hai
 Samajwadi Party is a 100 percent family party in the Lok Sabha, 44 percent of the TDP mps from Andhra Pradesh come from political families
 sabase kam khandaani kism ke saansad jayalalita kii party se aate hai
 Only two of its mps are sons of mlas
 congress kii pahchaan hi parivaarwaad se hoti he, honi bhi chahie
 But why does this dynasticism not appear in Akali Dal or Shiv Sena or in his party
 congress kyon nahin parivaarwaad par kuch kahati he
 Many examples of familism will also be found within the BJP
 rajasthan kii mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje ke putr dushyant singh saansad hai
 Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh's son is also an MP
 endie ke do sahyogi akali dal or shivasena kaa parivaarwaad bhi vikhyath he
 Anupriya Patel's own party also stands on the legacy of familism
 ramvilas paswan kii lok janashakti paariwarik rup se sabase loktantric party he
 Lalu Prasad Yadav of Rashtriya Janata Dal has already said that if our son does not contest elections, what buffalo will feed
 mamata banerjee kii trinmul congress main bhi unke bhattije ab power centre ban chuke hai
 The chief of Andhra's Telugu Desam Party and son of Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu has also become active in the party
 guuruuvaar ko raipur main loksabhaa adhyaksh sumitra mahajan kaa ek bayaan akhabaaron main chapa he Raipur Bhaskar's headline - dynasty is not evil in politics, do not worry about the media
 nai duniya kii hedline he raajnneeti main vanshavaad jaays he
 i do not know to whom the Speaker Mahajan is giving the certificate while enlightening the mlas of Chhattisgarh
 rahul gandhi ko yaa badal parivaar ko yaa phir apni party ke bheetar faile parivaarwaad ko
 Later said that familyism is not good but said that if any family comes then it is not a bad thing
 spikar mahajan bhul gayi ki parivaarwaad or vanshavaad to loksabhaa main mudda tha
 It was not BJP but of journalists
 damaadvaad yaa parivaarwaad agar bhrashtachar ke pratik hai to inhen bachaane main sab kyon jute rahete hai
 When you ask a leader, the answer comes that we have not seen corruption in our house
 wo to padosi ke ghar main rahata he
 By the way, the Congress was irritated by the word Prime Minister's son-in-law, so what were the comments that Rahul Gandhi said kisaanon kii baat ai
 
 ham ordinance paas karenge bhaiya
 
 
 Passed ordinance three times
 dam nahin he
 We will not let you pass in Parliament
 
 You can see it

 Girdhari Lal Dogra, was finance minister in Jammu and Kashmir for 27 years and got the opportunity to present the budget 26 times
 neshnal conference or congress main jivan bhar rahe girdhaari laal dogra ke damaad hai bijepi ke varisht netaa or vitt mantri arun jetali
 Prime Minister Modi, Finance Minister Jaitley, Chief Minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed and Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad also attended the birth centenary celebrations of Girdhari Lal Dogra
 ek congressi netaa kii janmashti par aisa samagam raajnneeti kaa ek durlabh or sukhad kshan to he hi, lekin vitt mantri arun jetali girdhaari laal ji ke damaad na hote to kya aisa sangam hota
 Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad said that Girdhari Lal Dogra, who was always a Congressman, could not build a house for himself even after presenting 26 budget
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne ek baat marke kii kahi na to girdharilal ji ne apane damaad ko vichaardhaara badal apane paale main aane ke liye kaha na damaad ne apane sasur ke rasookh kaa koi istamaal kiya
 Both of them went on different paths with their deeds
 yaheen par kehete-kehete pradhanmantri halke andaaz main kah gaye ki aaj to ham jaanate hai ki damaadon ke kaaran kya-kya baaten hoti hai
 Everyone laughed but the Congress felt that the Prime Minister had commented on Robert Vadra
 bas bachaav or hamalaa shuru hote hi baat parivaarwaad par pahunch gai
 Shakeel Ahmed said that one should not talk personally
 modi ji bhi kisi ke damaad honge
 Before that the Prime Minister said that not a single picture in the pictures on Girdhari Lal Dogra has his family
 sirf antim sanskaar ke vakt kii tasviir main parivaar dikhataa he
 This thing touched his mind
 pradhanmantri kii is baat par main apni tippanee karnaa chahta hum
 Have we assumed that the ideal leader is the one who keeps his family away
 yah kahaan or kab sabit hua he
 In this context, President Obama would be very bad who appears in public with his families
 raajnneeti ko sanyas samaj lenaa ajeeb tark he

 This is a big problem, but the meaning of familism must also be understood openly
 parivaarwaad kii buniyaad sirf Is not based on the relationship of khandani and khoon

 Just like Sushma Swaraj and Vasundhara Raje's family relationship with Lalit Modi, sometimes parts of the industry have such an impact on the government that we start calling it crony capitalism instead of family
 kroni capitalism kaa matlab kuch logon ke samooh kaa puunji or satta par niyantran While Robert Vadra is an example, the name of the son-in-law of Time Vajpayee of NDA One was also taken in such contexts

 The question is how long political corruption will be avoided in the name of familism or son-in-law
 in pidiyon ke sahare netaaon or karporate kaa rishta bhi khandaani level par chalane laga he
 If everyone believes that familyism is canker then there is courage in our leaders or parties to open front against familyism or son-in-law
 sab is mudde ko paal poskar rakhte hai taaki kamazor vakt main dhela maarane ke kaam aae
 Our democracy has come under the grip of a few families
 yah ek badi samasya to he lekin parivaarwaad kaa matlab bhi khulkar samaj lenaa chahie
 The foundation of familyism only khandaani or koon ke rishton par aadhaarit nahin hoti
 Sometimes a family relationship is formed due to business and friendly reasons
 jaise lalit modi ke saath sushamaa swaraj or vasundhara raaje kaa paariwarik sambandhakai baar udyog ke kuch hisson kaa sarkaar par itnaa prabhaav dikhne lagata he ki ham ise parivaar kii jagah kroni capitalism bataane lagate hai
 Crony capitalism means control of capital and power of a group of people rabart wadra ek misaal hai to endie van ke time vaajapeyi ke damaad kaa naam bhi aise prasangon main liya jaataa tha
 In the scam like Vyapam, a different kind of familyism is seen, then in the 2G scam you have seen a special kind of familyism
 isi saat april ko hindu akhbaar main rukmani shrinivasana ne apni report main likhaa tha ki hamaare 130 saansad raajnneetik khandaanon se aate hai
 Samajwadi Party is a 100 percent family party in the Lok Sabha, 44 percent of the TDP mps from Andhra Pradesh come from political families
 sabase kam khandaani kism ke saansad jayalalita kii party se aate hai
 Only two of its mps are sons of mlas
 congress kii pahchaan hi parivaarwaad se hoti he, honi bhi chahie
 But why does this dynasticism not appear in Akali Dal or Shiv Sena or in his party
 congress kyon nahin parivaarwaad par kuch kahati he
 Many examples of familism will also be found within the BJP
 rajasthan kii mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje ke putr dushyant singh saansad hai
 Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh's son is also an MP
 endie ke do sahyogi akali dal or shivasena kaa parivaarwaad bhi vikhyath he
 Anupriya Patel's own party also stands on the legacy of familism
 ramvilas paswan kii lok janashakti paariwarik rup se sabase loktantric party he
 Lalu Prasad Yadav of Rashtriya Janata Dal has already said that if our son does not contest elections, what buffalo will feed
 mamata banerjee kii trinmul congress main bhi unke bhattije ab power centre ban chuke hai
 The chief of Andhra's Telugu Desam Party and son of Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu has also become active in the party

 During this time 2 children have died
 haadasa dev prakhand mukhyalay sthit suryakund ke paas hua
 Earlier in the year 2012, during the Chhath Puja, there was an accident in Patna, the capital of Bihar
 is dauraan bans ke balliyon se bana pul tut gaya tha
 After this, 18 people died due to stampede
 agar brisben main chauthe din subah main cheteshwar pujaara or shikhar dhawan kii set jodi hi maidan main utarati, to kya is test kaa nateeja kuch or ho saktaa tha? Just before the start of the fourth day of play, Shikhar Dhawan suffered an injury to his right wrist during practice
 chot ke chalate shikhar dhawan turant ballebaazi karne kii sthiti main nahin the, ise dekhte hue unki jagah viraat kohli, pujaara ke saath khilne aae
 During the practice, Kohli also suffered an injury to his left arm, but he landed
 haalanki kohli is chunauti par puri tarah se khare nahin utar paae
 After scoring just one run off 11 balls, he returned to the pavilion off Mitchell Johnson
 kohli ke out hote hi bhartiya pari ladkadaa gai
 After this, three other batsmen of Team India returned to the pavilion within just 11 runs
 duusari ore aar aswin ke out hone ke baad ballebaazi ke liye shikhar dhawan utre to wo puri tarah se set najar aae
 Not only did he complete his half-century, but he also managed to push Team India to a score from which there was little scope for Indian bowlers to struggle
 apni pari ke dauraan unhone kalai kaa behtareen istemaal bhi kiya
 With this innings, Shikhar Dhawan has also indicated his return to form
 haalanki vah khud se niraash ho rahe honge ki shatak ke kareeb pahunchakar bhi shatak se chook gaye
 In such a situation, a question arises that if Shikhar Dhawan had started the innings with Cheteshwar Pujara on the fourth day, then the picture of Team India would have been second
 bahut sambhav he ki bhartiya pari pehle satr main nahin ladkadaati
 After the end of the match, from Shane Warne to Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Virat Kohli's place in place of Shikhar Dhawan has deteriorated the Indian innings
