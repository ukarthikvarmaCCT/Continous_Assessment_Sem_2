 zaayra wasim ne pehali baar kisi hindi film ke liye audishan diya to unke maa-baap ne kaha tha, ''hoga to nahin
 "but it happened
" unki pehali film dangal (2016) aaj tak kii duusari sabase badi hit hui or 16 saal kii umr main zaayra wasim ko sarvshereshth sahaayak abhinetri ke liye rashtriya puraskaar mila
 Zaira shared this anecdote in a conversation with India Today during the promotion schedule of Aamir Khan Productions' film Secret Superstar
 unhone bataaya tha ki kashmir main log unke kaam se khush hai or unase acting jari rakhane ko kehete hai
 But two years later, Zaira's mind has changed
 zaayra ne itani jaldi bollywood ko alavida kehane par apane soshal media accounts par likhaa, ''is halake main kaam karte hue mujhe logon kaa bahut pyaar, samarthan or prashansa hasil hui, lekin yah mujhe jahaalat kii ore bhi le gaya kyonki main anjaane main imaan (aasthaa) ke raste se bhatak gai
 i was constantly working in such an environment which was coming in the way of my faith and my relationship with religion was threatening
 ''yah lanbaa afasana apane faisle par ek afsosajada ladki kii baangi he, jise quran kii shiksha main apane saare jawaab or makasad hasil ho gaye hai
 The Sky Is Pink (october 11), directed by Sonali Bose, is Zaira's upcoming film in which she plays a motivational speaker who suffers from pulmonary fibrosis and dies at just 19 years old
 zaayra ne kaha he ki unhen is film ke prachaar se alag rakhaa jaae
 Zaira, who grew up in Hawal area of srinagar, often making headlines due to stone pelting incidents, has never been fond of films
 2017 main unhone badi safagoi se yah baat kabool kii thi, ''maine jo bhi filmein dekhi hai vah thodaa-thodaa karke hi dekhi
 
 
 Not a single film was seen from beginning to end
 '' abhinay se sabaka mahaj ek sanyog tha
 She never considered herself weak but also confessed that she grew up with a kind of 'social discomfort'
 2018 main ek instagram post main unhone hataasha main apane sangharsh par likhaa tha, ''khalipan, bechaini-si mahasoos kar rahi hum
 
 
 "" And "the mind has become numb and thoughts of suicide come
 '' ant main yah bhi likhaa ki is dar par kaabo paa liya ki kaisaa saluk hoga
 After that, his decision to leave the industry which is always in the limelight is not surprising
 kashmir main unki ek saheli kahati hai, ''unke maa-baap unako lekar bahut phikrmand rahete hai
 Zaira was criticized when she met Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti in January 2017 and the friend stood by her
 tab burhan vaani ke maare jane ke baad ghati kaaphi ashaant thi
 Zaira says of her retired banker father Zahid, "he cares for me a lot
" mere bare main koi kuch galat bole, yah unhen bardaasht nahin
 "zahid had reached Mumbai to talk to Aamir Khan and asked him to trust that he would be fully safe in his interest
" zaayra ne kaha, ''jis pal ve aamir khan se mili, sab thik ho gaya
 '' Aamir Khan was seen in Zaira with a star whose future is bright
 unhone 2017 main india today tivi se baatcheet main kaha tha, ''mujhe lagata he ki vah aaj hamaari industry kii sabase behtareen actor main ek hai
 When i turn back to watch my first or second films, i feel that i was nowhere near him in acting
 yah adbhut he ki desh ke har hisse se pratibhaaen film industry main aa rahi hai
 In both of her films, Zaira with her performance had beautifully screened the aspirations, anger and passion of today's girls
 casting diarector mukesh chhabda, jinke sahaayak ne hi srinagar main pratibha kii khoj ke dauraan unhen dhund nikaala tha, kehete hai, ''ve camere ke saamne behad eemaandaar rahati hai
 His name was also recommended by the school principal of St
 Paul's International Academy
 chhabda kehete hai, ''unhone sachche dil se kaam kiya
 Perhaps that's why he did so well
 '' zaayra ko bhartiya mukhyadhara main kashmiri aakankshaon or sapanom ko jeene vaali ek yuva ke rup main dekha jayega
 What could be a better medium than the films for its expression? Zaira, however, was a reluctant-looking superstar
 mahabuuba mufti ke saath mulaakaat ke kaaran hue virodhon se aahat zaayra ne apane 'khule ikraarnaame / maafee' main likhaa tha, ''main jo kar rahi hum us par mujhe bahut fakhr nahin he or main chaahati hum ki har koi, vishesh rup se noujvaan, apane vaastavik jivan ke role modelon ko talaashen
 May be they can meet them in the current era or they can meet in history
 ''zaayra ke kareebi unhen 'antarmukhi' bataate hai
 She is very close to her family and aware of her identity as a Kashmiri
 ve kabhi mumbai main basna nahin chaahati thim
 a friend of hers who is not surprised by her decision says, "social restrictions double for famous people in Kashmir but they remain comfortable
 ''zaayra ke faisle par film birdari ne mili-juli pratikriyaayein di hai
 Some have respected his 'personal choice', while many have objected to his attempt to justify his decision on religion
 baad main hataa liye gaye apane ek twit main ravina tandon ne likhaa, ''jisane ab tak sirf do filmein hi kin or jise industry se itnaa kuch mila, uski kritaghnata koi khaas myne nahin rakhti
 It would have been better had she introduced goodness and said goodbye to the film industry and kept her regressive thoughts to herself
 '' dangal ke nirdeshak nitesh tiwari ne kaha, ''yah apratyaashit tha, lekin yah unki jindagi he
 None of us has the right to comment on their personal decisions
 ''kashmir main zaayra ke faisle kaa un logon ne bhi swaagat kiya, jinhone do saal pehle mahabuuba mufti se milane par unka trol kiya tha
 Actor Mir Sarwar also appeared in his support, which will appear in Ashutosh Gowariker's next film
 bahut kam logon ko hi pataa hoga ki zaayra aage kya karnaa chaahati hai
 She had secured more than 80 percent marks in the twelfth examination and now she will probably enroll in college
 ve shaayad apane ghar main apni teen billiyon ke saath khubasurat paharipoon ke najaare lene main sukun kaa ehsaas karengi
 "I always tried to get out, but every time i reached the closed street
 main na to isamen santusht thi or na isse nikal paa rahi thi
 
 
 i kept fighting my conscience for so long
 jab aap khud se sangharsh kar rahe hon to yah bahut lanbaa or bojhil lagane lagata he
 "zaira may be feeling free now
" ''safar kaaphi behad thakaaoo rahaa
 
 
 Life is short but if you have to fight with your soul it becomes very long and cumbersome

 There has been a flood of messages with point-wise comments against one leader or in favor of one leader
 aise main yah jaruri he ki kuch buniyadi baaten bhi yaad kar lee jaaen
 In this sequence, some small, but thick things related to the election are presented
 1
 We are so frustrated
 iskaa saboot har din meerut main nagma ke saath hone vaale bartaav se miltaa he
 2
 jab tak is desh main inwarter or water purifaire ke aid aaen, tab tak netaa mangal-vangal par jane kii baat na hi karen to acha he
 3
 chil or kool hona acchhee baat he
 But this does not mean that the mother lying on the death bed should show a picture of three husbands and tell the child that you do not know who your father is and the son still runs away for IPL
 4
 Like when a traffic challan is cut, the DL is pierced
 vaise hi chunaav ke pehle dal badalane waalon ko daag dena chahie
 So that we can know from a distance how tainted they are
 5
 And Netaji, now stop making people in the name of fighting ideology
 kyonki koi bhi vichaardhaara vikaas karne se nahin rokatii
 Neither majority nor minority
 6
 All clerics should be sent on Haj and Pandit Char Dham Yatra at government expense
 munh main tepe chipkaakar
 Those who survive and issue fatwas should be asked what is the account of the donation box and zakat goods
 vakf or ashram kii jameen kahaan se ai or uskaa istemaal ab tak kaise hua
 7
 desh ke tamaam celebrity sanbhal-sanbhal kar bolnaa band karen
 If you support a party, then come out in front
 agar magar kii dagar par labar-labar na karen
 Being a supporter of any political party or ideology does not make you a good or bad person
 8
 Do show your children all the colors and news of these elections
 unhen pataa chalanaa hi chahie ki jis samaaj kii unhen baar-baar duhai di jaati he, vah kis kadar ashleel ho chukaa he apane sabase jaruri karm ke dauraan
 Children should see and learn and if possible, teach us that things are not so expensive
 9
 You belong to any party
 sonia gandhi yaa mayawati yaa minakshi lekhi yaa shajia ilmi kii morph kar bhaddi banaai gai tasviir whatsap karne se aapkaa ghatiyapan hi pataa chalata he
 Therefore, apply your art to make a monalisa and move beyond the gender-sexual organs
 raajnneeti kii baat karen agar dil kii jagah dil or dimag kii jagah dimag he to
 10
 or sabase jaruri baat
 Summer is not much yet
 isliye apane munh kaa istemaal dahi jamaane ke liye na karen
 Say what you feel
 halke rahenge
 Anyway, the whole country is a victim of astonishing constipation
 so dimagi taur par farig hona jaruri he

 AAP MLA Alka Lamba on Saturday expressed happiness over the disputed proposal to withdraw the Bharat Ratna award to former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi for not supporting the party leadership
 lamba ne shuukravaar ko dilli vidhansabha main aap vidhayak jaranel singh dwaara pesh is vivaadit prastaav kaa samarthan karne se do took inkaar karte hue vidhansabha sadsyta se istipha dene tak kii baat kah di thi
 Calming the controversy arising out of it, senior AAP leader and Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said that the party does not support any proposal related to the withdrawal of the honor
 sisodiya ne party netritv dwaara lamba se istipha maange jane se bhi inkaar karte hue kaha ki na to istipha maanga gaya he or na hi unhone istipha diya he
 At the same time, Lamba also refused to resign
 sisodiya ke bayaan ke baad lamba ne twit kar kaha, 'mujhe behad khushi mahasoos ho rahi he ki party ne swargeey rajeev gandhi ko die gaye bharat ratna kaa samarthan kiya he
 This country can never forget Rajiv Gandhi's incomparable sacrifice and sacrifice
 'unhone us prastaav ko bhi twitor se hataa diya jisaki vajah se yah vivaad utpann hua
 Lamba said, 'I am removing the copy of the resolution which was not passed in the Assembly
 ' ullekhneey he ki lamba ne shuukravaar ko is maamle main apni naaraazgi jaahir karte hue kaha tha ki aap sanyojak arvind kejariwal ne unase vidhayak pad se istipha dene ko kaha he or party pramukh ke faisle ko sweekaar kar vah istipha de dengi
 Sisodia said that the controversy arose regarding a resolution passed during the last two days of discussion in the Assembly to provide justice to the 1984 anti-sikh riot victims
 unhone spasht kiya ki sadan se paarit mul prastaav main bharat ratna sammaan waapas lene kii baat shaamil nahin thi
 AAP spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj, who was present in the House at the time of the passing of the resolution, said that party MLA Jarnail Singh had to move a resolution to provide justice to the riot victims
 isi samay aap vidhayak somnath bharti ne vidhayakon ko vitarit kii gai prastaav kii prati par rajeev gandhi kaa bharat ratna sammaan waapas lene kii maang pen se likh kar ukt prati jaranel singh ko sadan patal par pesh karne ke liye de di
 Bhardwaj said that the original resolution was passed by the House which did not mention the demand related to the former Prime Minister
 unhone mana ki bharat ratna lautaane kii maang ko sanshodhit prastaav kaa hissaa mana ja saktaa he, jo ki paarit nahin kiya gaya
 Asked whether he would like to withdraw the Bharat Ratna award from Rajiv Gandhi, Sisodia said, "we have no idea that Bharat Ratna will be withdrawn from Rajiv Gandhi
" 'unhone is bhram ko vivaad kii vajah bataate hue kaha ki iske dur hote hi vivaad bhi khatm ho gaya he
 Sisodia also dismissed speculation about Lamba's resignation and offered his resignation
 ullekhneey he ki lamba ne kaha tha ki rajeev gandhi ne desh ke liye qurbaani di thi
 It cannot be forgotten
 isliye unhen diya gaya bharat ratna sammaan waapas lene vaale prastaav kaa vah samarthan nahin karti hai
 What Mahendra Singh Dhoni retired from Test cricket, it seems as if he donated everything
 australia main test series kii paraajay par gussa achaanak unke prati sahanubhuti main badal gaya he
 Cricket fans across the country are remembering what he did in his career
 aisa kyon ho rahaa he?dhoni ko bhartiya test team kii captaini saunpi gai thi
 It was his job to elevate it
 team ne bhi saath diya
 Some of that attitude also showed amazing, which Sourav Ganguly gave to the Indian team like a Gurmantra
 ab aaie, dhoni ke acshan riple se samajhie or tay kiijie ki ve kitne mahaan captain hai-1
 He took the country to number one in the ICC Test rankings
 lekin ye bhi sachai he ki 2000 se 2010 tak jis team india ne videshon main 41 test khele, sirf 14 haare
 He has lost 15 of the 24 Tests played since 2011 under Dhoni's captaincy
 yani sirf ghar main hi sher hai dhoni
 2
 van-de or tii-20 main team india ko duniya main ooncha mukaam hasil he
 Dhoni's captaincy is also credited to him
 in donon formet main unke netritv main team india ne vishwacap jite hai
 But there is also a truth that the team they are part of in the IPL tournament is under question
 dhoni par bhi aarope lage hai
 He is also an employee of India Cement, a company of the controversial former BCCI president Srinivasan
 yani har tarah se ek korporate house se jude hai, jiskaa judaav cricket se bhi he
 Now that all the players of the Indian team have been associated with a corporate house due to IPL, then how will Dhoni alone do
 team ke bheetar netritv par sawaal to uthne hi hai
 There is bound to be ruckus
 sahvaag, gautam gambhir, harbhajan, jahir jaise khilaadi behad saamaanya maahaul main team se baahar nahin hue
 Team India has lost in the first two Tests in Australia
 teesraa haarate-haarate bachi
 Before such a fate of the fourth and final Test would happen, Dhoni abruptly retired
 bich majdhaar main
 Shockingly

 Police in Haryana had an encounter with miscreants
 jisamen police kii goli lagane se ek wonted badmaash ghayal ho gaya
 The police later arrested two miscreants from the Delhi border
 police ke mutabik donon badmaashon ke khilaaf kai maamle darj hai
 Including the case of looting millions from a property dealer
 gudgaanv police kii maane to krime team car savaar do logon ko police naake par rokane kii koshish kii to un donon ne police par hi firing shuru kar di
 Police chased the miscreants from 3 to 4 km
 lekin ve saream firing karte hue bhaagate rahe
 Meanwhile, the police arrested both of them on the Delhi border
 disipi krime kaa daawa he ki pakade gaye donon badmaash new palam vihaar ilaake main property dealer ke saath hui 12 lakh kii lut main shaamil the
 On Friday, she was informed by the informer
 usee ke aadhaar par krime team ne bajhagheda gaanv ke paas police naake par un donon ko rokane kii koshish kii thi
 The miscreant's car hit the roadside with stones near the Delhi border
 isi dauraan ek badmaash ko pair mangolilgi or police ne donon badmaashon ko bhaagane se pehle hi giraftaar kar liya
 One crook is from Rohtak and the other is from Bahadurgarh
 kanpur dehaat ke rura thana ke bharthu gaanv main raat ke vakt ek aisa haadasa saamne aayaa jisane puure ilaake ke logo ko chaunkaa diya
 The family of a young man named Chhotu lived in Bharthu village
 ghar main ek patni or 6 bachche saath hi rahete the
 The roof of the house was of mud which fell suddenly and all the children of the house died
 kal raat chotu kaa parivaar rojaanaa kii tarah khaanaa khaane ke baad apane ghar main chaiyn kii neend so rahaa tha
 Although he had not the slightest idea that he would not have any sleep in the morning
 raat main ghar kii chat aisi giri kii chotu ke sabhi baccho kii maut ho gai
 After the accident, all the people buried in the debris were removed with the help of local people and were admitted to the district hospital for treatment
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki masuumon kii umr 3 saal se lekar 12 saal tak he
 Chhotu did not even know that in a few hours his whole family would leave him and his wife alone and face death
 kismat kii baat dekhiye chotu kii patni ek vivaah samaaroh main shaamil hone ke liye apane maayke gayi hui thi isaliye vah is haadase se bal bal batch gayi
 According to sources, it is learned that Chhotu is also seen fighting between life and death at this time
 modi sarkarbhartiya railway ko nayaa rup dene main juty hui he
 For this, Indian Railways is revamping railway stations with the adoption of new technology for safety standards
 isi ke tahat agle teen saal ke bheetar desh ke 10 railway steshnon ko airport jaisi suvidhaon se las kiya jayega
 By 2020, all these railway stations will start to look like airports
 saarvajanik kshetra kii company neshnal building construction corporation (NBCC) ko in railway steshnon ko airport si suvidhaon se las karen kaa jimmaa saunpa gaya he
 The company will have to complete the work by 2020
 iconomic times kii ek report ke mutabik in railway steshnon kaa punarravikas karne main 5000 karod rupee kharch kiye jaaenge
 These railway stations are the railway stations that will be equipped with modern facilities by 2020
 isamen dilli kaa sarai rohilla railway stational, lakhanu, gomti nagar, kota, tirupati, nellore, ernakulam, puducheri, madagaanv or thane railway stesan shaamil he
 These railway stations will be prepared on the lines of the airport
 iskaa matlab yah he ki jo bhi suvidhaayen aapako airport par milti hai, vahi sab suvidhaayen aapako in railway steshnon par bhi milengi
 An mou has been signed between Indian Railways and NBCC to implement this scheme
 vaise to pariyojna kii samay seemaa teen saal rakhi gai he, lekin enbisisi inhen agle dhai saal main hi puraa kar lenaa chaahati he
 Quoting the NBCC chairman, the newspaper has written that work on some of these stations will start from December this year
 iske alaava kuch ek par janvari se bhi kaam shuru ho saktaa he
 In Bihar, the Jai and Veeru pair of the Mahagathbandhan stand once again at the crossroads
 unke saamne kai vikalp hai
 They can take any route if they want
 alag-alag raah chun sakate hai lekin sawaal ye he ki kya lalu or nitish ek hi raste par saath-saath chalate rahenge yaa
 
 
 After the Congress was defeated in Bihar assembly elections 2015 by defeating BJP, it seemed that Nitish and Lalu's pair is now stuck with fevicol
 lekin maujuuda halaat main yah chaay main duube biscuit kii tarah ho gai he
 Now broken, now broken
 
 The car is running without trust and confidence
 lalu or nitish kii dosti kaa sira 1970 se jaakar judata he, jab sampurna kranti andolan ke dauraan jab donon ek saajha dushman ke khilaaf lard rahe the
 Even in the 2015 assembly elections, when both came together after a long time, they both had the same enemy
 
 
 lekin aaj lalu jiske khilaaf ladane kii baat kar rahe hai vonithish kaa dost nahin he, to dushman bhi nahinhai
 And Nitish has proved this by his political moves
 ab ye samay hi batayega ki nitish lalu ke saath bane rahenge yaa phir endie ke paale main chale jaaenge
 Let's know how long friendship between Lalu and Nitish happened
 
 
 or kab khinch gai donon ke bich lakshmana rekha
 
 
 1
 lalu or nitish pehali baar jaiprakash narayan ke socialist andolan ke dauraan saath aae
 It was the need of the hour that both had to fight against the same enemy
 aaj se takreeban chalis saal pehle lalu or nitish ne haath milaayaa tha
 During that time also Lalu was fighting the ideology of Hindutva and in order to keep his strength against them, Lalu wanted to keep a socialist leader like Nitish Kumar with him
 indira gandhi ke khilaaf jaiprakash kaa andolan dilli main satta parivartan laane main kaamyaab rahaa
 It was also the success of Nitish and Lalu as a youth leader
 donon kii siyasat ab patari par thi
 2
 1990 main bihar vidhansabha chunaav main janata dal ko jeet mili
 In the race for the post of Chief Minister, Nitish Kumar fully assisted Lalu and Lalu became the Chief Minister of Bihar
 3
 Two years later, differences began to arise between Nitish and Lalu
 kathith taur par naukariyon main ek jati ko praathamikta dene or transfar-posting main bhrashtachar kii vajah se nitish kumaar maujuuda rashtriya janata dal ke pramukh lalu se naaraaz the
 4
 1994 main nitish kumaar ne samta party banaakar lalu se alag raah chun lee
 But Nitish got only seven seats in the assembly elections, while Lalu became the chief minister by winning the assembly elections for the second time
 5
 In 1996, there was a stir in Lalu's political life
 patna hoicourt ne chaara ghotaale main sibiai jaanch ke aadesh die or lalu ko jail janaa padaa
 It is said that Nitish Kumar had a big hand behind the petition filed for investigation in the case
 lekin lalu ne mukhyamantri kii kursi par pakad dhili nahin hone di
 His wife Rabri Devi went to jail seated on the Chief Minister's chair
 or agle vidhansabha chunaav main bhi baaji maar le gaye
 6
 iske baad nitish ne bijepi ke saath haath mila liya
 As a minister in the NDA government, he stayed in Delhi for a few days and then returned to Bihar
 nitish or bijepi ne lalu ke khilaaf 2005 ke vidhansabha chunaav main haath milaayaa or 15 saal ke lalu yug vaali laalaten kii batti buja di
 7
 nitish kumaar ne june 2013 main bijepi ke saath naata tod liya lekin unhen isaki baari keemat chukaani padi
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Nitish got only two seats, while Lalu got four seats
 in donon ko pachhadte hue bijepi kii aguwai vaale endie ne 31 siton par kabja jamaaya
 8
 ek maheene baad nitish kumaar rajyasabha chunaav main samarthan ke liye lalu ke paas pahunche
 After 20 years, the two leaders embraced and then the foundation of the grand alliance was formed
 congress bhi saath ai or 2015 ke bihar vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi kii aguwai vaale endie ko karaari maat jhelni padi
 At that time Lalu needed Nitish and Nitish needed him
 lekin ab sthiti pechida ho gai he
 
 dilli kii siyasat main kaaphi ulatpher ho chukaa he
 Lalu and his family are surrounded on charges of corruption, benami property
 nitish par bijepi kaa dabaav badhata ja rahaa he, unhen endie main aane kaa nyauta mil rahaa he
 The grand alliance is weakening
 dekhnaa ye he ki nitish or lalu main se koun pehle duusare kaa haath chodta he
 Former World Tennis veteran Boris Becker, a former world favorite, said that India's current star tennis player Sania Mirza proved lucky for her

 It will go on to celebrate what kind of celebrating the nights, who has given the right to hurt the hearts of the people, it is time to go away from your limits, do not come in the eyes of the world

 In May 2014, when the Modi government took power at the Center, a few months later, militants in Assam executed a series of attacks, killing more than 80 people
 ab ye ‘shaitan’ phir se jaag uthe hai
 That too at a time when the BJP government was formed in Assam about two months ago
 bihar vidhansabha chunaav main haar ke baad bijepi ke liye naak kaa sawaal ban chuke assam chunaav ke dauraan piem modi ne bhi khub mehnat kii or purvottar main pehali baar apni party ko satta saunpane main kaamyaab hue
 Ghatlekin but the Kokrajharshah of Assam reverberated to the death of many innocent people on Friday with a blast of bullets and grenades
 balajan tiniyaali bazaar main auto rickshaw main aae nakaabposh hamalaavaron ne eke-47 se firing kii jisamen 13 log maare gaye or 50 ghayal bataae ja rahe hai
 However, an attacker has been killed but his companions have fled and are reported to be 3-4 in number
 sena or sthaneey police unki talash main jute gai he
 According to several early reports by devils, the attacker belonged to the Songbjit faction of the NDFB (S) ie National Democratic Front
 is sanghathan ne kareeb do saal pehle soobe main ek ke baad ek kai hamale kiye the jinamein 80 se zyada log maare gaye the
 The attacks took place on 23 December 2014 in Chirang, Sonitpur and Kokrajhar
 usee saal may main is tarah ke hamale pravasi musalamaanon par hue the, jab dilli main 10 saal baad nai sarkaar prachand bahumat ke sahare satta main aa rahi thi
 But the December 2014 attack was the biggest massacre in the history of Northeast India

 Many of these militants who have been involved in bloody violence for decades demanding autonomous Bodoland surrendered, but the Songbajit-led faction, the NDFB (S), refused to give up
 23 disambar kii wo manahuus shamendiefabi ke ugravadiyon ne 23 disambar 2014 ko shaam 6 baje ke kareeb assam ke kokarajhaar, sonitpur or chinraag jilon main hamalaa kar kam se kam 81 logon ko maut ke ghat utaar diya tha
 Most of them were from tribal and Christian communities
 ye hamale aise vakt hue jab ye log christmas kii taiyaariyon main jute the
 The severity of this attack in Assam, which has been burning in the fire of militant violence for nearly two and a half decades, is also evident from the fact that in 1992, a total of 80 people were killed in a year and in 1993 74 people were killed
 phir hinsa kaa dar23 disambar vaali ghatana ke baad adivasee samudaay main kaaphi rosh paidaa hua or jabardast virodh pradarshan hue
 After this, in the fierce violence, the tribal and Bodo community started burning each other's houses

 ' a new alliance of terrorists and the Pakistani army has been prepared for the attack on India
 pakistan ne bed ection team taiyaar kar lee he
 a team that is trying to target hit targets along the Indian border using hit and run strategy
 paak kaa ye mishan bhi yuddh unmaad badhaane kii hi chaal he
 This Bad Action Team is formed from the alliance of the Pakistani Army and the terrorists, which is the new weapon of the Pakistani conspiracy against India
 sutron ke hawaale se mil rahi khabar ke mutabik pakistan ne jammu-kashmir se lagi seemaa par aise kai daste tainaat kar die hai jo mauka milte hi bharat kii seemaa main ghuspaith ke liye taiyaar hai
 These squads, named as the Bad Action Team, include Pakistani army commandos, former commandos and dangerous terrorists
 bed ection team kaa makasad saaf he
 As soon as they get a chance, they will enter the Indian border and target the army and administrative bases along the border and then will quickly cross the border
 unke nishane par hai sena ke tactical headquarter, hathiyaaron ko depo, tel ke bhandar or jaruri saamaanon kii supplai line
 Bad action teams of 8-10 people have also been given special training for such actions
 bed ection team taiyaar karne ke peeche bhi pakistan kii manshaa jang kaa unmaad paidaa karnaa hi he
 Through such actions, Pakistan wants to increase the tension on the border so that the world can be shown the awe of war between two nuclear weapon countries
 taaki duniya kaa dhyaan aatankwaad ke khatme kii taraf se khinch kar jang kii rokthaam kii taraf kiya ja sake auki pakistan is koshish main mumbai hamale ke baad se hi laga hua he
 However, India is also ready to give a befitting reply to this new plot of Pakistan
 sena, surakshabalon auki khufia agenciyon ko alert kar diya gaya he auki seemaa par nigaraanee auki sakht kar di gai he
 Pakistan is plotting a new conspiracy against India
 wo aatankwaad ke masale par duniya ko jhansa dena chahta he
 He is creating a frenzy of war and in this effort, he has started increasing the mobilization of forces on the Indian border
 pashchimi seemaa se fouj hataane ke peeche bhi chaal yahi he
 According to the report quoting the agency, Pakistan has increased the mobilization along the Line of Control in Poonch and Rajouri in Jammu and Kashmir
 pathankot se lekar jammu ke akhnur tak pakistani rangers kii halchal bhi ekaek kaaphi tej ho gai he
 Not only this, Pakistan is also reducing the number of troops from its western tribal areas and they are being deployed along the eastern border with India
 khabar he ki pakistan ne pichley hafte vajiristaan main tainaat fouj kii do divijanon main se ek ko waapas bula liya he or unhen bharat se lagi seemaa par tainaat kiya ja rahaa he
 Last week, Pakistan deployed 5 more army brigades along the border with Jammu and Kashmir
 sawaal ye he ki aakhir pakistan par border par phonjon kaa jamaavada badha kar kya paigaam dena chahta he?bhartiya fouj seemaa par pakistani phujon kii badhati tainaati ko gambhirtha se le rahi he
 But many experts believe that Pakistan wants war, not just a frenzy of war, because it knows that the work that cannot be done by war will only create a frenzy of war
 asal main pakistan is baat ko acchhee tarah samajhataa he ki jang ke maidan main wo bharat kii jabardast takat kaa muqabla nahin kar saktaa lekin jang kaa unmaad failaa kar wo duniya kaa dhyaan aatankwaad ke masale se bhatka saktaa he
 In fact, Pakistan's strategy is to increase the mobilization of troops on the border and provoke India to make rhetorical statements and then tell the world how dangerous the situation in South Asia has become
 phir duniya aatankwaad ke mudde ko bhul kar jang rokane kii koshish main jute jaaegi
 This conspiracy of Pakistan was also exposed because the brigades which they have deployed along the border of India are not part of its strike corps 1 and strike corps 2
 ye brigades pakistan army kii defensive kor ke hai
 Pakistan wants to take double advantage of this strategy
 pakistan apane pashchimi kabyli ilaakon se sena ko hataa rahaa he taaki taliban ke khilaaf america ladaai kamjor pade or america par is baat ke liye dabaav banaaya ja sake ki wo bharat par rukh naram karne kaa dabaav banaae
 Obviously, the Indian strategists will have to remove any diplomatic cut from this new plot of Pakistan

 The first Tuesday of the year in the Delhi Metro was a problem for passengers
 metro kii blue line par dinabhar metro ruuk-ruuk kar chalati rahi
 As a result, the traveler continued to be troubled by the expectation of a pleasant journey
 metro main musafiron ke liye musiibat tab shuru hui jab mangalvaar kii subah kareeb 11 baje metro kii over head elactricity line main kharabi aa gai
 Fault in OHE near Pragati Maidan metro station
 lekin jaldi hi iskaa asar metro kii line number 3 or 4 par dikhne laga
 The metro trains on this line run between Noida, Dwarka and Vaishali where they were parked and the speed progress of the metro was limited to 20 kilometers per hour at stations around the grounds
 metro kii raftaar par brake laga to dhire dhire noida se dwarka or vaishali tak alag-alag steshnon ke bich chal rahi trainen bhi isse prabhavit hone lageen
 Because the speed of the pass-metro speed of Pragati Maidan reduced the bunching of trains and trains were stopped at different stations and allowed to proceed only after the line was cleared
 metro kii speed thamane se badi pareshanemetro kii raftaar par lagaam lagi tometro main safarkar rahe yatriyon kii musiibat bhi bad gai
 Because the distance the metro used to travel in ten minutes, it increased from half to one hour
 iskaa nateeja ye hua ki is root ke tamaam steshnon par yatriyon kii baari bheed jamaa ho gai
 At the same time, the situation within the metro trains also became strenuous
 dmarsi kii taraf se kaha gaya ki pragati maidan par oechai main kharabi kii vajah se raftaar kam kii gai
 So that OHE repair work can be done while trains are in operation
 lekin oechai kii kharabi ko thik karne main metro ko kareeb dhai ghante lag gaye
 Then the entire track circuit of the metro was jammed and the passengers had to wait in the train for hours to complete their journey
 bheed or deree kii vajah se kai yatriyon ne to metro se baahar nikalakar safar ke duusare tareekon ko istemaal karnaa hi behatar samajha
 According to a spokesperson for the Delhi Metro, the OHE problem was rectified at around 3:30 pm

 Addressing the party's Brahmin bhai-chara conference here, Mayawati said that the BSP is also in favor of giving reservation to the Savarnas on economic grounds and in this regard i have written a letter to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh as Chief Minister
 unhone basapa virdohi dalo par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki uttar pradesh main vidhansabha ke chunaav kareeb aate dekh virdohi dal brahamanon ko basapa se dur karne ke liye bhraamak prachaar ko tej kar sakate hai, jaisaa ki ve pehle se hi chalaate rahe hai
 He said that opposing parties can propagate this, i have only promoted people of my caste as a Chief Minister, being a Dalit, which is a lie
 mayawati ne kaha ki mukhyamantri ke rap main maine puure pradesh ko parivaar maanakar mukhiya kii tarah kaam kiya he or jis tarah parivaar kaa mukhiya sabase kamjor bachche ko vishesh tarjeeh detaa he
 We have given backward Dalit society people due to centuries of casteist system
 unhone kaha ki yah kaam to purvavarti sarkaron ko bhi karnaa chahie tha
 On this occasion, Mayawati defended the promotion of the family members of the party's national general secretary Satish Mishra and energy minister Ramvir Upadhyaya under the BSP rule, saying that they did not allow people in their party and government on the basis of the family but the party and its policies Is promoted on the basis of their loyalty

 Accusing the governments of all political parties in power before the BSP of exploiting the Brahmins, Mayawati said that expressing faith in the bsp's 'sarvajan Sukhaya, Sarvajan Hitay' policy, the Brahmin joined the Samaj Party and gave tickets to the party It has been a matter of whether or not to give a position in the government, has taken full care of the interests of Brahmin and upper caste society
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki basapa virdohi dalon kii sarkaar ban jane par samantvaadi takate ek baar phir samaaj par habi ho jaayegi or samaaj ke sabhi virgo ke garibon chaahe vah brahman ho athwa anya kaa shoshan shuru ho jaayegaa
 Earlier addressing the conference, the party's national general secretary Satish Chandra Mishra, referring to the full respect given to the Brahmin and Savarna Samaj by BSP chief Mayawati, termed her as 'goddess of law and justice' and appealed to the Brahmin society He should be associated with the BSP without being influenced by the propaganda of the opposition parties
 unhone is maukey par ‘brahman shankh bajaayegaa, hathi badhata jaayegaa‘ or ‘tilak lagaao hathi par, baaki sab baisakhi par‘ jaise naare bhi lagaaye

" Mamata Banerjee has given the message that she is doing everything she can for Hindu refugees
 '' mamata khud ko logon ko enarasi se bachaane vaale 'paharedaar' ke rup main pesh kar rahi hai
 This is equivalent to the term 'chowkidar' used by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Bengali 'paharidar'
 aakraamak tevar main mamata kahati hai, ''unhen (bhaajapa ko) bengal se kisi bhi naagarik ko chune se pehle mujhase nibatna hoga
 
 
 BJP is ruled by Assam, so it can implement NRC there
 ''yah mudda uttar bengal main gorkha, rajbongshi or anya jaateey samoohon ke bich bhi logon kaa dhyaan khinch rahaa he
 At the Cooch Behar rally, Mamta claimed that out of the 12 lakh Bengalis included in the Assam NRC, 11 lakh were Rajbongshi, while in Darjeeling she said that 1,50,000 Gorkhas were excluded from the NRC
 kuchbihar or jalpaigudi kii loksabhaa siton par bhaajapa kii jeet main rajbongshiyon ne badi bhoomika nibhaai thi, jabaki gorkhaon ne darjeeling main party kaa samarthan kiya tha
 Banning the Citizenship Amendment Bill, calling it a 'lollipop' of the Center, Mamata said that it cannot guarantee citizens their rights
 assam ke enarasi se baari sankchaya main hinduon kaa naam baahar rah jane ke baad se bhaajapa baikfoot par he or vah is vidheyak ko bangladesh, pakistan or afghanistan se aae hinduon or anya gaiyr-muslim sharnaarthiyon ke liye ek suraksha kavach bataakar isaki vakaalat kar rahi he
 "the Trinamool Congress is taking political advantage of the NRC issue by convincing both Muslim and Hindu refugees that no one is safe in bjp-ruled states," says Vishwanath Chakraborty, professor of political science at Ravindra Bharti University, Kolkata

 '' *** centre kii narendra modi sarkaar dwaara notebandi ke faisle ko bhale hi pachaas dinon kaa samay biit gaya ho lekin mamata banerjee ise lekar lagaataar modi sarkaar par hamale kar rahi he
 Annoyed by the arrests of TMC mps Sudeep Bandopadhyay and Tapas Pal after the demonetisation, Mamata Banerjee has been continuously taunting the Modi government
 somvaar ko pashchim bengal ke bardwan jile ke shahar bardwan main yojit maati utsav ko sambodhit karne pahunchi mamata ne ek baar phir modi ko aade haathon lete hue rajya hi nahin balki desh bhar ke udyog dhandho ko band karne kaa kaam bataaya
 Mamta said that what will happen to the CBI, IT after us, will arrest how many people
 modi babu chahen to sabhi ko arest kar len, bharat ko sirf jail banaaenge
 Mamatane said that the President should take the initiative to improve the situation by interfering in this matter, Mamta said that we are going to agitate for this for the next 72 hours
 maati utsav main mukhya vaktaa ke rup main yahan pahunchi mamata banerjee ne kaha ki wo jaanati he vyavsaay main mandi chal rahi he, unhone kaha ki isse main bahut dukhi hum
 i know that the farmers have not been able to work for the rabi crop
 mamata ne kaha ki bardwan ke ek gaanv kaa kisaan bank main paisa nahin hone ke kaaran mazdooron ko paisa nahin de paaya or apane aap ko maar daalaa
 Mamta said that Cashless India is being talked about, there is no cash and the talk of Cashless India

 He alleged that due to the decision that 12 percent of the villages do not have banks, the country is being destroyed
 mamata boleen ki ab petrol pump par bhi card nahin chalegaa to kya hoga, lagaataar kaarkaane band ho rahen he
 If Mamata said, Modi Babu, worship you or save people
 unhone kaha ki logon ko bainkon se paisa nikaalane main kaaphi pareshaani aa rahi he, 40 pratishat bainkon main paisa nahin he or 60 pratishat paisa band hai

 team india ke star ballebaaj viraat kohli aaj apana 28waan janmdin mana rahe hai
 The heights that Virat has touched in a very short time
 shaayad hi aisa koi cricketer kar paaya he
 Today Virat is one of the most wanted cricketers not only in the country but in the world
 desh ho yaa phir videsh har jagah kohli ke chaahane waalon kii ek lambii fouj he
 Those who know Viratvirat closely related to Chiku and his teammates call him as 'chiku'
 aakhir viraat kaa naam chiku kaise padaa aaiye aapako bataate hai
 There is a very interesting story behind it
 baat us samay kii he jab viraat dilli kii ranjai team main nae-nae shaamil hue the or khud ko sabit karne kii koshishon main jute the
 Till then, Virat had played only 10 Ranji matches
 dilli ranjai team main un dinon virendra sahvaag, gautam gambhir, rajat bhaatia or mithun manhas jaise diggaj khilaadi shaamil the or viraat in sabhi ke saath dressing room share karke kaaphi khush the
 At that time, the teams of Delhi and Mumbai were competing in the Ranji match
 ek shaam viraat ne apane hotel ke paas ek hair salon dekha or vahaan se bal kataakar nae luk main hotel waapas aae
 Virat asks the other players present at the hotel about his new haircut how it looks
 to dilli ke sahaayak coach ajit choudhary ne jawaab diya ki tum chiku lag rahe ho or aise viraat kohli kaa naam chiku pad gaya
 Virat Kohli played the first international one-day match in 2008 when Virat Kohli was playing in Under-19 and Ranji matches
 tabhi se har kisi ko maaloom ho gaya tha kii dilli kaa ye chuki ek din desh ke liye khelegaa or viraat kohli ko srilanka ke khilaaf 2008 main bhartiya vanade team main shaamil kar liya gaya
 In that series, Virat could not show anything special and had only one half century
 lekin saal 2009 main viraat kohli ke balle ne antarrashtriya str par apane balle kaa kaamaal dikhaanaa shuru kiya
 Kohli smashed a not out 79 against the West Indies in Johannesburg, then scored 107 against Sri Lanka in Kolkata
 iske baad se hi kohli ke balle ne apane antarashtriya str par shandaar pradarshan karnaa shuru kar diya
 Virat Kohli made a lot of runs on foreign land against teams like Australia, South Africa, England, West Indies and New Zealand and made a lot of runs on his own ground
 cricket ke har formet main viraat ne apni ballebaaji kaa johar dikhaaya he
 He is one of the finest batsmen in the world today
 kohli ne desh ke liye 176 vanade muqablon main 52
 Has scored 7570 runs at an average of 93
 jisamen unke 26 shatak or 38 ardhashatak shaamil hai
 The way he scored a century, it seems that he will break the record of Sachin Tendulkar's most centuries
 kohli ko saal 2014-15 main test team kaa captain banaayaviraat kohli ko saal 2011 main dhoni kii captaini main bhartiya test team main shaamil kiya
 But as soon as Mahendra Singh Dhoni left Test captaincy, he was made the captain of the Test team on the tour of Australia in 2014-15
 us samay bhartiya team badlaav ke daur se guzar rahi thi
 Dhoni's retirement got the team in trouble
 to team main manmutav kii khabaren bhi kohli ke liye kisi chunauti se kam nahin thim
 In such a situation, Virat Kohli not only united the team but also added aggression in the team by trusting his players
 us daure main viraat kohli ne captaini main pehle match main hi shatak jadaa
 Kohli became the fourth Indian captain to score a century in the first match while captaining
 test team kii captaini main hit rahe hai viratviraat kohli kii captaini main team india ne srilanka ko srilanka main or westeindies ko westeindies main haraane main kamyaabi hasil kii
 Under Kohli's captaincy, the Indian team has so far managed to defeat Sri Lanka, South Africa, West Indies and New Zealand
 vahiin bangladesh se ek match kii siries drow par khatm thi
 Under the captaincy of Kohli, the Indian team has played 16 Tests so far, in which the team has won nine, lost two, and five matches have been drawn
 vahiin gharelu maidaanon par team ne ek bhi match nahin ganvaaya he
 The team has become number one three times under the captaincy of Virat Kohli
 england ke khilaaf test siries par he najarkohli kii captaini main pehali baar bhartiya team janvari-farvari 2016 main number ek bani thi
 After this, the team achieved the number one chair in August this year and now India has achieved this feat by defeating New Zealand for the third time
 saaf he kohli kii captaini main team main or nikhaar or jeetne bhukh badhati ja rahi he jo kisi bhi team ke liye bahut acchhee baat sabit ho sakati he
 Kohli is now eyeing the five-test series against England
 jis tarah bhartiya team kohli kii aguwai main khel rahi he usase ye saaf he ki england kii raah kisi bhi lihaaj se aasaan nahin hogi
 Till now Kohli has scored 6592 runs at an average of around 46, playing 48 Test matches
 jisamen 13 shatak or 12 ardhashatak shaamil hai
 a new novel by Bhagwandas Morwal has arrived - Sur Banjaran
 hamaare yahaan hindi sahitya main kisi abhinayta, lok kalakaar yaa lokagayak kii jindagi ko aadhaar banaakar shaayad hi koi kahani yaa upanyaas likhaa gaya ho
 Surendra Verma's novel Main Chand Munda took a deep look at the National School of Drama and Modern Hindi Theater on the pretext of the life story of an actress
 marathi bhashaa main abhiram bhadkamkar kaa upanyaas bal gandharva or bangla main vinodini daasi kaa upanyaas nati vinodini charchit rachanaaen rahi hai
 Even in Marathi, Shirvadkar's play Nat Samrat can also be mentioned, even though his creation was inspired by the Italian playwright Louis Pirandello's play Henry the Fourth
 yah upanyaas do kaarnon se rekhaankit kiya janaa chahie
 Not only does a gimmick present the life story of the Natya-style singer and artist Ragini, more than that it brings to us in a very poignant manner the grand story of the birth, rise and fall of this theatrical genre
 ham jaanate hai ki nautanki kii kanpur style main abhinay par or hathras style main gayikee par jor hota he
 Morwal has uncovered each and every fact with great research and research
 upanyaas main aae sabhi paatr hamaare itane parichit hai ki padhate-padhate ham unke saath ekaakaar ho jate hai
 In this novel, there were chances that all the details would become very emotional and melodramatic
 lekin lekhak ne kahin bhi aisa nahin hone diya, chaahe raagini kii maa kii mrityu kaa prasang ho athwa pradarshan ke dauraan unke pati kii mrityu kii ghatana—jis tarah se in prasangon ko rachaa gaya he, usase lekhak kaa kalatmak sanyam jaahir hota he
 What is more restrained than this is that the city which Shah Jahan's eldest son Darashukoh settled and in which his heroine Ragini lived, comes to us in the last four lines of the novel
 sur banjaaran ko padhuya mere liye ek ahladakaari anubhav se guzarana tha
 For this, the author's effortless language, intermittent lingua franca and dialect and idiomatic style are responsible for this experience
 lekhak is had tak apane kathanak or uski nayika ke saath gunfit ho gaya he ki kuch tathyon kii andekhi kar di gai he
 For example, it was not the case that Agha Hashar Kashmiri had to write a play every day in Parsi Rangamandali
 sachai ye he ki unhen ek saal main ek nayaa naatak likhakar dena hota tha
 It also seems necessary to mention here that the names of almost all the characters in the novel are real, so why only the heroine's name is fictional? There must have been some social pressure of the creator behind this
 iske baavjood vishaywastu, rachana style or pathneeyata main nishchit rup se yah upanyaas ek mile kaa pathar mana ja saktaa he

 The question of the existence of West Bengalwam is a state of West Bengal in the opposite direction and interestingly, the Chief Minister of this state is challenging Narendra Modi in the most aggressive manner, then the BJP too can improve its performance in the same state and its potential loss of Hindi belt

 In such a situation, when Ruthe Kshatrap and some new allies joined the BJP, then the enthusiasm had to be high

 Except Assam, the BJP currently has only one seat in the Northeast, while the Congress has five seats
 lekin agar bhaajapanit gathbandhan kii baat karen to kul siten chaar ho jaati hai
 The mighty Kshatrapoki a decade and a half ago, Assam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi asked in a hilarious tone: Who is Ajmal? The AIUDF chief, Maulana Badruddin Ajmal, who won three seats at the same time as the Congress in the 2014 Lok Sabha, also asked the same question, who is Tarun Gogoi? Ajmal's party, which got training from Deoband, won 10 seats in 2006 within six months of establishment in 2006

 He hoped that the ups and downs are temporary and will improve soon

 devda kii dekharekh main haal ke aam chunaavon main congress mumbai kii sabhi chah siten haar gai
 Elections for the state government are to be held after three months in Maharashtra
 iske baavjood yahaan congress ke netaa naitikta se dur power hasil karne ke liye shakti sangharsh main vyast hai

 Sonia Gandhi took note of this and reportedly offered Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh to take over as interim president
 singh ne samajhadaari se manaa kar diya or kaha ki "yuva or gatisheel netaa ko rahul gandhi ko safal bananaa chahie
 "young and largely entitled leaders unhesitatingly unite around Rahul Gandhi

 Dwivedi claimed that not all meetings were authorized for the new appointment in place of Rahul Gandhi
 saboot ke taur par kaha gaya tha ki eke antni inamen se kisi bhi baithak main shaamil nahin hue the
 a senior Congress leader says, "even Dwivedi has now raised his voice
 ve patel ke saath score set kar rahe hai

 endie raashtrapati pad ke ummidavaar ke taur par bihar ke maujuuda garvanar ramnath kovind ke naam kii ghoshnaa kar chuki he
 The way many opposition parties apart from NDA have given the BJP leadership the confidence to support Ramnath Kovind, after that there are speculations that the next President of the country could be Ramnath Kovind
 raashtrapati pad ke ummidavaar ke taur par ramnath kovind ke naam kii ghoshnaa karne ke liye bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ne khud press conference kii jisamen unhone kai baar kaha ki ramnath kovind dalit samaaj se aate hai
 After that many ministers and BJP leaders tweeted statements and tweeters in the media mentioning 'ramnath Kovind comes from the Dalit class'
 aisa lag rahaa he ki ramnath kovind ko raashtrapati ummidavaar ghoshit karne ke saath hi pradhanmantri narendra modi or amit shah kii jodi ne 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke liye apni chunavi ranneeti ke bisaat bichaana shuru kar diya he
 If sources are to be believed, Ramnath Kovind does not originally come from a Sangh or BJP background
 ve nabbe ke dashak kii shuruyaat main bijepi main shaamil hue lekin uske baad bhi party ke kai dalit netaaon ko darkinar karte hue unhen chunanaa party ke andar or baahar sabhi ko aashcharya chakit isliye karata he kyonki party main kai dalit netaa hai jinka prabhaav shaayadramnath kovindse zyada apane samaaj par rahaa he or vartmaan main bhi he
 This decision clearly shows that the way Ramnath Kovind's name has been announced for the presidential candidate after electoral equations, keeping in mind the factored factor in the vote bank, it seems that somewhere to penetrate the maze of vote bank politics Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Amit Shah pair in the coming days, the name of the candidate for the Vice Presidential election South India or Musli i should not do it with society because BJP is weak in both these areas
 ab sawaal ye hai kibijapi ke netahameshaa kehete hai ki wo dharm ke aadhaar par or jati ke aadhaar par raajnneeti nahin karte hai lekin raashtrapati pad ke ummidavaar ko dalit bataa kar party kya sandesh dena chaahati he
 One thing is clear that the BJP no longer runs with ideology, but they are also winning the election

 iske jariye sibiai nideshak ko vittiya shaktiyaan pradaan kii gai hai jo anya ardhsainik balon ke mahanideshkon ke samaan he
 In order to protect the CBI investigation from political interference, the affidavit is likely to suggest the formation of an accountability committee whose members will be retired judges and who will oversee the independent functioning of the investigating agency

 Defeating BJP and Congress candidates, Third Gender Madhu Bai, who was elected Mayor of Raigad district of Chhattisgarh, came in for much discussion
 lekin puure raigarh nagar nigam kshetra kii saaf-safai kii jimmedaari sanbhaalane vaali meyar madhu bai khud gandagi se itani pareshaan ho gai hai ki unhone apana sarkari bangala tak chhodane kii dhamkee de daali he
 After becoming the mayor, relations between Madhu Bai and other municipal officials remained fine for a few days, but now the situation has become that Madhu Bai has made up her mind to leave her government residence
 vastav main meyar madhu bai ke sarkari awaas ke baahar gandagi kaa yah alam he ki badboo ke maare naak band kerani pade
 Local people of the area have also started to question whether the Mayor himself is living in this bungalow under these circumstances? In fact, the officers of the Nagar Nigam have deliberately built a garbage dumping yard near the Meyer bungalow
 yahaan rojaanaa shahar bhar kaa kachra ikaitha hota he
 But garbage is not picked up from this dumping yard for many days
 natijatan badboo or gandagi ke chalate meyar kaa apane hi ghar aana janaa dubhar ho gaya he
 Mayor Madhu Bai does not even see any justification for building a dumping yard near the bungalow, especially when a large number of government land is lying vacant on the outskirts of the city
 meyar madhu bai kaa kahana he, "shahar ke mukhya margon ko chhodkar kahin bhi saaf safai nahin ho rahi, jabaki har maah 80 lakh rupee keval safai ke naam par kharch ho rahe hai
 "he has blamed the commissioner of Nagar Nigam for this
 udhar kamishnar kii daleel he ki vah meyar ke bayaan se ittefaq nahin rakhte
 According to him, daily cleaning is done
 philhal gandagi se pareshaan meyar ne safai na hone kii surat main agle 48 ghanten main apana sarkari bangala chhodane kaa altimetum de diya he
 It has to be seen how much the municipal administration is able to stand in the eyes of this mayor
 jahaan logon ko apane vash main karnaa, chal-kapat or takat kaa durupyog hota he, vahaan aam taur par paise ke hi golmaal kii baat hoti he
 i am sorry to say this, but in this case
 
 Amma was not at all different from other abbot
 ve kisi chumbak kii tarah paise or sone ke gahanon kii ore khinchati thim or unka daan-paatr hameshaa upar tak bharaa rahata tha
 For years, i noticed that the rich and generous devotees were welcomed by royalty, and were greeted with a twinkle
 bahut dinon tak to main unke is vyavhaar ko yah sochakar sahi tehraati rahi ki yah amiron se lekar garibon ko dene kaa ammaa kaa tarika he, modern robinhood kii tarah
 Later i realized that a large part of the offerings placed directly in Amma's hand went to her family without stopping
 yah chadhaava bhakt is yakeen se chadhaate the ki isse unhen dharmarth kaary chalaane main madad milegi
 Initially i did not object to this
 mujhe lagata tha ki apane mata-pita ko badhibia ghar or bahanon kii shaadi ke liye dahej kii vyavastha ammaa kii jimmedaari thi, khaskar aisi sabhyataa main jo paariwarik mulyon par is kadar jor detii he
 But Amma went beyond limits in this work
 unke mata-pita, teenon bhaaiyon or teenon bahanon ko moti rakam or sona mila
 *** (gail Dreadwell with Amritanandamayi) His aggression also increased with the number of devotees and his scolding was no joke
 ve is saluk ko akasar yah kahkar sahi tehraaya karti thim ki ve apane najdiki logon ko hi daantati hai
 For years, i kept comforting myself by believing that i was the closest and then clinging to this idea like a man on the verge of a mound
 jo bhi ashram main rahanaa chahta tha vah aalochana karne yaa ammaa par sawaal uthaane kaa anjaam jaanata tha
 Anyone who dared to make a sound was immediately put on the black list, understood to be a traitor, and was seen as a danger hovering over the faith of his disciples
 ***agali subah tadake hi main ammaa se baat karne ke liye librari kii taraf jane lagi
 
 
 He immediately closed the door and held me in the arms
 isse pehle ki main kuchhjaan paati, main farsh par padi thi or vah mere saath jabardastee kar rahaa tha
 It all happened in the blink of an eye
 maine bebas mahasoos kiya
 My first shock felt like a sting, i groaned in pain
 main koi virgin nahin thi magar chah saal se maine kisi purush ko khud ko chune kii ijaajat nahin di thi
 i lay there, staring at the wall without moving, but this time tears were in my eyes
 meri deh main tanik bhi yon uttejnaa nahin thi, sirf aatank tha, or sadma
 i could not believe what was happening
 magar bahut der ho chuki thi

 Describing unemployment as a major problem in the country, where the entire opposition is terming the Modi government's tenure as a failure, there is a village in Rajasthan where employment has become a waste
 jodhpur se 70 kilomtar dur raajvaan gaanv ke logon ke paas roji-roti kamaane kaa jo rasta he, usee ne inke fefdon ko kamjor bana diya he, jisase puraa gaanv ek gambhir beemaari main funs gaya he
 Alam is that many people have lost their lives
 har 5 saal baad desh main aam chunaav ke rup main loktantr kaa sabase bada parv manaaya jaataa he, jisamen tamaam sabjbag dikhaae jate hai lekin kya jameen par un baton par amal hota he, ye sawaal hameshaa bana rahata he
 During the Lok Sabha elections in Rajasthan in 2019, Aaj Tak's team reached Rajwa village, about 70 km from Jodhpur, where it seemed that the disinterest of the system has become the destiny of this village
 dashakon se inaki jindagi achche dinon ke liye mohataaj he
 There is no drinking water nor basic facilities in rural villages under the grip of silicosis disease
 roji-roti ke liye mazdooree kaa jo rojgaar bhi he, wo jaanaleva ban gaya he
 There is an outbreak of a serious disease called silicosis on this village, which most of the men of the village are struggling with
 jindagi chalaane ke liye gaanv ke purush aasapaas ke ilaakon main 'send stone' kii khadaanon main pathar kii kataai kaa kaam karte hai
 But the dust and smoke from the mine goes into their lungs, it is giving rise to a serious disease
 alam ye he ki gaanv ke kai log is beemaari se jujhate hue apni jaan ganvaa chuke hai
 Youth like Nathu Singh and Rajiv suffer from silicosis disease
 zyaadaatar marijon ko ummid he ki sarkaar jaldi hi unhen ilaaj ke liye aarthik madad muhaiyaa karaayegi
 Many people like Polaram's son Ramesh are struggling with life as well as death
 haalanki, khadaan ke maalik prakaash gahalot se jab poocha gaya ki mazdooron ko silicosis se bachaane ke liye khadaan main kaam karte samay suraksha niyamon kaa paalan kyon nahin karavaaya jaataa to usne mazdooron par hi sawaal khadaa kar diya
 Prakash Gehlot says that every rule under the mining law is followed in his mine and workers are always asked to follow safety rules
 baharhaal, gaanv ke purush jahaan gambhir beemaari se jujh rahe hai to mahilaon kii sthiti bhi kam pareshaan karne vaali nahin he
 Even before entering the village, the roadside women are seen working hard under the scorching sun on the barren land carrying a shovel and spade
 aamadani ke naam par in mahilaon ko naregaa kaa sahaara he jiske tahat sadak ke kinare ek talab khodne kaa project laayaa gaya
 In a 15-day employment, earning 60 to 100 rupees per day, there is no fixed date for its payment
 is gaanv ko dashakon se sapane dikhaae gaye ki 24 ghante pani muhaiyaa karaayaa jayega lekin aaj bhi vah sapana mahaj sapana rah gaya
 If water ever came in the tap, otherwise it cost 300 to 400 to get drinking water through tanker
 maheene main 600 se 800 rupee is gaanv kaa har parivaar pani ke tanker par kharchaa karata he
 Most women consider water scarcity as the biggest problem
 gaanv main nal to lag gaye lekin pani nahin aata he
 If water comes 1 day in a week, it is considered by women as the greatest pleasure
 baharhaal, ek baar phir chunaav he
 The village will come out again, cast votes, cherish dreams of hope, but the question that stands before them is, will their hopes ever be fulfilled? Will their good days ever come? Because this village of Jodhpur is such a place where life struggles and death also clashes

 Have you ever heard someone write a suicide note first and decide to die later? Or would you believe that someone should write a suicide note and hide it in such a way that nobody has found it till three hours after death? And the amazing thing is that after three days, give the same suicide note to the police, who himself is under suspicion
 reporter puja tiwari kii maut ke teen din baad saamne aae ek suicide note ne achaanak ye saare sawaal khadey die hai
 Suicide note of worship in the circle of doubt, the simple note of getting a suicide note means that this letter was written before dying
 chaar pannon ke is suicide note ko likhaa angreji main gaya he par bhashaa hindi kii he
 Two out of four pages are signed but not two
 dastakhat ke taur par puraa naam likhaa gaya he- puja tiwari
 But the strangest thing is that no date has been written on any of the four pages of the suicide note
 web portal main jarnlist ke taur par kaam karne vaali puja tiwari kii maut ke teen din baad ab achaanak ye suicide note saamne aayaa he
 That too through the person who is in doubt
 haryana police kaa inspector amit
 Amit himself handed over this suicide note to the police on Wednesday evening
 uth rahe hai ye sawalbaat gaur karne vaali he ki ek aisa insaan jo marane ja rahaa he, kya wo us suicide note ko kisi bag main chupa kar rakhega? yaa phir aisi jagah rakhega jahaan kisi kii bhi najar aasaani se pade
 Especially in such a situation when she herself wants her family or friends not to be harassed for her death? Then why did Pooja hide the suicide note in such a place that it was found after three days? And that too after three days, the person himself reaches the police with that note, towards which the needle of suspicion rotates fastest in these three days
 police ko nahin lekin amit ko mila suicide noteinspector amit ke mutabik jis bag main puja ne suicide note rakhaa tha, us bag ko wo bhi istemaal karata tha
 He had gone to Panchkula with the same bag
 buudhvaar shaam ko achaak bag main rakhe suicide note par najar padi, jiske baad usne use police ko saunp diya
 Now the question arises here that after the death of Pooja, the police razed the entire house of Pooja
 magar tab wo bag or suicide note police ko kyon nahin mila? haalanki jis bag main saside note milane kaa amit daawa kar rahaa he ki wo bag puja kii maut ke ek roj baad bhi usee ke flats main tha
 Why Pooja has already written Suicide Notes Another important question arises about the suicide note
 ek may kii shaam se lekar der raat kareeb dedh baje tak puja lagaataar yaa to inspector amit ke saath thi yaa phir uski dost amarine uske saath thi
 Then when did Pooja write the suicide note? Usually the suicide-makers decide to die suddenly
 amuman aisa nahin hota ki suicide note pehle se likh kar rakh le or marane kaa faisla baad main kare
 Then just one and a half hours before the death, it did not seem like she was going to commit suicide by talking to Pooja
 police karegi puja kii handriting kii jaanchainhin tamaam sawaalon ko dekhte hue faridabad police philhal suicide note kii sachai ko lekar kuch nahin kah rahi he
 Police say that first she will match the suicide note and the handwriting of Pooja
 report aane ke baad hi tay hoga ki suicide note sachmuch puja ne hi likhaa he yaa phir ye police ko bhatakaane kii koi chaal he
 However, 24 hours after giving the suicide note, the same Inspector Amit has been arrested by the Faridabad Police
 police ne ipisi kii dhara 306 ke tahat amit ko giraftaar kiya he yani us par khudakushi ke liye majaboor karne kaa maamla darj hua he
 Now the question is that if Pooja committed suicide due to Amit, then why has she written something else in the suicide note? Use two pens to write a suicide note
 The suicide note is written with two different pens, because the suicide note Two different colored inks have been used to write
 pehla panna nile rang kii syaahi se likhaa gaya phir shaayad bich main hi syaahi khatm ho gai to baaki kaa note duusari kalam se likhaa gaya yani kaale langs kii syaahi se
 But no one is responsible for the death
 
 
 suicide note main saaf likhaa he ki puja kii maut ke liye kisi ko jimmedaar nahin mana jaae
 Neither to family nor friends
 alabatta faridabad kii doctor dampatti kaa naam likhte hue unke khilaaf bhrun hatya ke silsile main karrwai kii baat jarur likhi gai he par unhen bhi puja ne khud kii maut ke liye jimmedaar nahin tehraaya he
 Pooja's death has become the total bottom line of the mystery suicide note
 Pooja was upset after the sting operation against the hawkish doctors because a doctor had registered a blackmailing case against her
 yahaan sawaal is maamle main police kii bhoomika ko lekar bhi he
 Was the police harassing Pooja knowingly or under pressure from doctors? Obviously, despite the whole story, the mystery of Pooja's death has yet to be solved
 madhya pradesh ke grahamantri babulal gaur mahilaon ko lekar ek baar phir vivaadit bayaan diya he
 Recalling his Russia tour at a conference held at the BJP office, he said, 'I once went to Russia
 jis kaarykram main mujhe shaamil hona tha, vahaan ek mahila ne aakar mujhe maathe par chuum liya
 i said that if i come to know about it here, then my election ticket will be cut
 ' Gaur, an 85-year-old BJP leader, did not stop here
 unhone ek or kissa sunaaya jo majaak kii hadon ke paar nikal gaya
 Gaur said, 'in this meeting, the wife of a local leader came to me and asked about my dhoti, what is it wearing? How do you tie it without chains and belts? He said, Teach me how to tie it, then i said, i can teach you the art of tying the dhoti, but in private
 ' Nearly a hundred BJP workers and party supporters were present in this meeting, who liked this story very much and also played applause
 aapako bataa den ki gaur ne pichley saal june main bhi ek vivaadit bayaan diya tha
 He called the rape a social crime and said that it is sometimes right and sometimes wrong
 bijepi ne tab bhi is bayaan ko gaur kaa nijee bayaan bataate hue pallaa jhaad liya tha
 Earlier too, he had said that the rapes in South India are less because the women there dress lightly
 bijepi karyaalay main yojit ek sammelan main unhone apane rus daure ko yaad karte hue kaha, 'ek baar main rus gaya tha
 At the event where i was to attend, a lady came and kissed me on the forehead
 maine kaha ki yah baat mere yahaan pataa chal gai to meraa ellection kaa tikat cat jayega
 ' 85 saal ke bijepi netaa gaur yaheen nahin ruke
 He narrated another anecdote that went beyond the limits of the joke
 gaur ne bataaya, 'isi sabha main ek sthaneey netaa kii patni mere paas aakar meri dhoti ke bare main poochne lagi ki yah kya pahan rakhaa he? yah bina chen or belt ke kaise baandhte ho? usne kaha mujhe yah baandhna sikhaao to maine kaha, main tumhen dhoti baandhne kii kala sikhaa to saktaa hum, magar akele main
 ' is sabha main sau ke kareeb bijepi kaaryakarta or party samarthak maujuud the, jinhone is kisse ko khaasaa pasand kiya or taaliyaan bhi bajaain
 Let me tell you that Gaur also made a controversial statement in June last year
 unhone rape ko soshal krime bataaya tha or kaha tha ki yah kabhi-kabhi sahi hota he or kabhi-kabhi galat
 Even then, BJP had dismissed this statement as Gaur's personal statement
 iske pehle bhi unhone kaha tha ki dakshin bharat main rape kam isliye hote hai kyonki vahaan kii mahilaayein salike se kapade pahenti hai
 Gaur, an 85-year-old BJP leader, did not stop here
 unhone ek or kissa sunaaya jo majaak kii hadon ke paar nikal gaya
 Gaur said, 'in this meeting, the wife of a local leader came to me and asked about my dhoti, what is it wearing? How do you tie it without chains and belts? He said, Teach me how to tie it, then i said, i can teach you the art of tying the dhoti, but in private
