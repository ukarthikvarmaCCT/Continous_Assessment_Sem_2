 While the company's CFO will be put on behalf of Vodafone
 iske alaava siio kii niukti donon companiyaan mil kar karengi
 Will a new company come after the two companies merger? Vodafone CEO Vittorio has said that the two companies are strong, so will continue to run from different brands even after the merger
 yani ye donon milakar koi nai company nahin banaaenge, balki vodaphone or idia ke naam se hi chalenge
 Have the two companies become one from today? No, because the official announcement has been made but the process has not been completed
 idia ke board se is deal ko hari jhandi mil gai he, lekin abhi kai apruval milane baaki hai
 These include the Reserve Bank of India, the market regulator Securities and Exchange Board and the Foreign Investment Promotion Board
 2018 tak prakriya puri hogi jiske baad ye donon companiyaan ek ho jaaengi
 How many shares will be there? 45 in the company's shares after the merger
 1 fisadi vodaphone ke paas hoga jabaki 26 fisadi idia kaa hoga
 Apart from this, the rest will be of shareholders
 kya number-1 ban jaaegi ye company?vilay ke baad is bharat main is company ke 400 million customers honge or market share 35 fisadi kaa hoga
 That is, Airtel is currently the number-1 telecom company, but after the merger, Airtel will move to number two

 Will Airtel and Jio be hurt? Reliance Jio is fast pacing in India, so pressure on other companies is bound to increase
 is vilay se airtel or jeeyo ko khaas nuksaan nahin hoga, kyonki airtel ne pehle hi telenor ko kharid liya he or company apane 4G network ko behatar karne ke liye tikona digital network se spekatrum kharid rahi he
 The value of this deal is expected to be 1500 to 1700 crores

 Tariff can be war
 With this merger, users can get new plans and packs in the coming days
 kyonki pehle jeeyo ko takkar dene ke liye airtel nae plan launch kar rahi thi, lekin ab iske baad airtel ke saath idia-voda bhi nae plan or packs ke saath bazaar main hongi

 rajkumaar hiraani, yani bollywood nirdeshak raju hiraani ke mutabik, unke saath bhi aisa hi hua, tabhi to abhinayta aar
 Madhavan had refused to work in 'munnabhai MBBS', and now Raju Hirani is thankful to him for this reason
 darasal, raju hiraani 'munnabhai embibies' ko ek tivi serial ke rup main bananaa chaahate the, or chunki un dinon madhavan kaaphi mashhoor tivi abhinayta the, so, raju kahani likhane ke baad unheen ke paas gaye the
 
 
 But Madhavan refused to do this TV serial
 
 
 uske baad use film ke rup main banane kaa nirnay liya gaya or bade parde par sanjay dutt ko banaaya gaya 'munnabhai', or film release hui disambar, 2003 main, yani aaj se 12 saal pehle
 
 
 Today 'munnabhai MBBS' enjoys the status of a classic film, and this is perhaps the reason why Raju Hirani is now thanking R
 Madhavan, because only after his refusal did Raju decide to make a film on this story
 tippaniyan By the way, Raju Hirani is distributing r Madhavan's film 'sala Khadus', so Raju, who came to his promotional event, recalled the old things and said, "thankfully, Madhavan refused to do 'munnabhai' 
 
 
 aaj 'munnabhai' ko ek alag mukaam hasil he, or us series kii chaar kahaniyaan likhi ja chuki hai
 
 
 Right now i am making a biopic by Sanjay Dutt, and after that i will make 'munnabhai 3'
 
 
 " Significantly, excited by the success of 'munnabhai MBBS', the pair of producer Vidhu Vinod Chopra and director Raju Hirani made the sequel to the film 'lage Raho Munnabhai' in 2006, and it was also a successful success
 
 
 pehali film ke pramukh kalakaaron main se arshad varsi, boman irani or jimi shergill sikwel main bhi pramukh bhoomikaaon main dikhe the, jabaki pehali film kii nayika greysi singh thim, or duusari film main nayika thim vidya baalan
 
 
 Actually, Raju Hirani wanted to make 'munnabhai MBBS' as a TV serial, and since Madhavan was a very famous TV actor in those days, Raju went to him after writing the story
 
 
 lekin madhavan ne yah tivi serial karne se manaa kar diya
 
 
 It was then decided to make it as a film and Sanjay Dutt was made 'munnabhai' on the big screen, and the film was released in December 2003, 12 years from today
 
 
 aaj 'munnabhai embibies' ko clasik film kaa darja hasil he, or shaayad yahi vajah he ki raju hiraani ab aar madhavan kaa shukriya adaa kar rahe hai, kyonki unke manaa karne ke baad hi raju ne is kahani par film banane kaa faisla kiya tha

 Today 'munnabhai' has a different status, and four stories of that series have been written

 During the marriage of Sania Mirza and Shoaib Malik, everyone had made a lot of talk that this relationship will not last and the age of this marriage will not be long
 lekin yah khilaadi jodi is khubasurat bandhan ke chah saal puure kar chuki he or inaki kahani kisi romantinc filmi kahani se kam nahin he
 People of both countries are surprised that how they are able to fulfill this relationship with so much love and respect
 lekin sabhi kii atakalon par viraam lagaate hue yeshaadishuda jodaapane pyarbhre rishte ko puri eemaandaaree ke saath nibhaane main kaamyaab rahaa he
 Let's know, behind their beautiful relationship, these eight things which prove their understanding
 
 
 1
 The most special thing about Sania and Shoaib's relationship is that they both understand each other
 personal or profeshnal level par unki bonding bahut acchhee he
 Shoaib celebrates that many times we can share some things only with his partner and he says that he is lucky that Sania is with him
 2
 There is a cultural difference between the two, about which people made a lot of talk and also made political statements
 is par sania kaa kahana tha ki vah kisi pakistani se shaadi nahin kar rahi he, vah ek aeseinsaan se shadikar rahi hai jise vah pyaar karti hai
 3
 kai baar ham rishte main sabakuch parfect chaahate hai lekin parfect rishta wo hota he jo ek-duusare kii achchhai-buraai jaanane ke baad bhi saath rahe
 Shoaib was asked many times which team Sania is supporting in the Asia Cup, then his reply was very good that Sania will definitely support Team India but she also wants me to give my best in the field of sports
 4
 Whether you believe it or not, but both of them often give up their happiness for each other's happiness
 5
 How well they handle many needless and nonsense questions, it is less to be praised
 soch kar dekhie ki koi aapse baar-baar ye puche ki aapaki indian wif pakistani team ko kyon saport nahin karti or aise hi or sawaal
 But these two always like to answer very calmly

 Shoaib fully realizes that Sania is an Indian sportsman and will always have to prove his loyalty to the country and he always supports Sania as a good husband
 shoeb ne kabhi bhi sania ko unke desh pakistan ko saport karne ke liye nahin kaha

 donon har samay ek-duusare ko saport karte hai bhale hi puri duniya unke khilaaf kyon na ho

 yah kapal kabhi aapane pyaar ko jataane se peeche nahin hatana phir chaahe twitor par photose share karnaa ho yaa phir kisi intervyuu kesavaal-javabahon
 So are you also playing your relationship like this? cricket jagat kii sabase badi vanade team banakar ubhar rahi he bangladesh
 This team has shocked the cricket world by defeating the world's top teams in odis
 pakistan ke khilaaf 3-0 se clin sweep ke baad bangladesh ne pehle bharat ko teen maichon kii vanade siries main 2-1 se patkhni di or phir buudhvaar ko dakshin africa ko bhi 2-1 se dher kar diya
 None of them had sent their second-class team and the full strength team had to face the mouths of the Bangla lions
 bangladesh main cricketka nayaa daur aa chukaa he or isse ab sabhi badi timen darana shuru kar chuki hai
 Fear is also justified because this team has given five big lessons to the cricket world
 world cap 2015 main pehali baar ye team world cap nock out main pahunchi to 2017 champions trophy ke liye bhi apana naam pakkaa kar liya he
 This will be the first time Bangladesh has been included in the top 8 teams in the ODI team rankings and won the Champions Trophy ticket
 1- nidar hai bangla sher-bangladesh cricket team kaa sabase majboot paksh he uskaa nidar hona
 When the team plays, it does not make them afraid of the result
 team haar ke dar se upar uth chuki he
 There is a dialogue of the film Mary Kom 'don't scare anyone so much that the fear in them is over
 ' bangladeshi team kuch aise hi khilne lagi he
 However, he is yet to be tested on a foreign pitch
 pakistan, bharat or dakshin africa teenon tiimon ke khilaaf bangladesh kaa khilne kaa andaaj ek jaisaa tha
 2- Not just the captain, the whole team is aggressive - Every team captain has his own different way
 aisa mana jaataa he ki aakraamak captain team ko sahi disha main aage badhaata he
 If positive aggression takes you forward, negative aggression can destroy you
 bangladeshi team kaa har khilaadi aakraamak hokar kheltaa he
 With captain Mashrafe Mortaza, every cricketer dominates the opponent
 wicket milane par team kaa celibrasion bhi aakraamak andaaj main hi hota he
 Bangladeshi team by its own style makes the sweat of the opposing team
 3- ham saath-saath hai-teesri sikh ye ki bangladeshi cricketron ne duniya ko dikhaaya he ki ekajute hokar kaise khelaa jaataa he
 The team has the perfect mix of young and experienced players
 team main chaar shandaar olerounder khilaadi hai
 If the bowling team has strengthened, then the batsmen also performed their work well
 team kii sabase acchhee baat he ki wo ek khilaadi par nirbhar nahin rahati he
 Mahmudullah, Shakib Al Hasan, Nasir Hussain and Mashrafe Mortaza are all-rounders and have the ability to pull the team out of any situation
 mahamudullah bharat ke khilaaf siries main chotil the lekin taskin ahamed ne unki kami nahin khalane di
 The team's bench strength is also strong
 4- saumy kii 'raudra' ballebaaji-saumy sarkaar kaa bas naam hi saumy he lekin wo bahut khatarnaak ballebaaj hai
 Everyone has seen the way this batsman has batted for Bangladesh in the recent past
 16 vanade main unhone kareeb 50 kii ausat se ran thoke hai
 Soumya, with a strike rate of around 103, shows his form as soon as he arrives and puts the opposing bowlers under pressure from the start
 ek samay tha ki ballebaaj ke naam par bangladesh ke paas tameem ikbaal or mushafikur rahim ke alaava koi nahin tha
 But as Soumya, the team has found a batsman who gives a bang to the team by batting
 saumy se salaami ballebaajon ko pari ke aagaaj kii tip leni chahie
 5- Mashrafe's 'magic' - Mashrafe Mortaza set a new example of captaincy
 aakraamak hone ke saath mashrafe main sooyeeboojh kii bhi kami nahin he
 They lead the team from the front
 khud ke pradarshan se team ke saamne udhaaharan pesh karte hai
 Mashrafe does not shy away from taking the front on difficult times and does not hold back from experimenting
 team ko aise hi captain kii jarurat hoti he
 Murtaza's decisions about the change from field placement to batting order seem to be a hit right now
 ashish dhawan ne america kii yel uniwarsity se shandaar tareeke se grajuation ke baad, wal street main kaam kiya, uske baad harvard uniwarsity se distinction ke saath emb kiya or phir chriscapital kii sah-sthapana kii, jo bharat main sabase safal privet equity form main se ek he
 Anyone can get jealous seeing Dhawan's resume
 lekin do saal pehle unhone central square foundation (siesuef) kii sthapana karke venture capitalist se venture philenthropist banane kii raah apana lee
 This organization helps social entrepreneurs with a mission to transform the Indian education system
 dhawan kehete hai, ''do saal pehle bharat ne ek global test diya, or ham ajukeshan ke maamle main neeche se duusare sthaan par rahe
 On the one hand we are talking about being superpower, on the other hand our education system is worse than emerging countries
 is sector main kaaphi kaam karne kii jarurat he
 "I met some very capable students at Ivy League's Anubhavayal
 lekin mujhe sabase zyada tajjub yah jaanakar hua ki unamem se zyaadaatar apane desh kii seva karnaa chaahate hai
 He had a great desire for public service
 lihaaja, yel main maine sabase mahatvapurn sabak yah siikhaa ki paisa bananaa hi sab kuch nahin he, or yah ki aap apane desh ke liye kaaphi kuch kar sakate hai or karnaa chahie
 i learned a lot from my peers at Harvard
 mere section main aisa shaks tha, jisane baad main america kii special oparations force green berat kaa netritv kiya
 In this way there were wonderful people, who were really leaders
 bijness skool aapako global citigen banaata he or isse vibhinn paristhitiyon main leadership ko samajhane or use saraahne main madad milti he
 In addition, you spend a lot of introspection while spending two years in business school
 harvard main hi maine apane lakshya tay kar liye the
 i wanted to become an entrepreneur at the age of 30 and at the age of 45 wanted to do some work in the social sector
 agar main kisi bijness skool main nahin padhaa hota to yakini taur par nahin kah saktaa ki main yah faisla kar paata
 Career change i wanted my second career apart from business and wanted to focus on one of the problems of the country
 jab main hyskool main tha to mere teacher ne mujhe junior class main 'maths ij fan’ naam ke topic ko padhaane ke liye kaha tha
 i loved this work very much
 lekin jab maine apni maa ko bataaya ki main teacher bananaa chahta hum to unhone is vichaar ko sire se khaarij kar diya
 i also slowly gave up on this idea, but the Teaching worm had bitten me
 auntreprenyar banane ke apane pehle lakshya ko puraa karne ke baad maine sochaa ki agar main doosraa kariyar bananaa chahta hum to mujhe isaki yojana kaaphi pehle shuru kerani hogi
 i started joining the board of volunteer organizations
 iske jariye maine sahi logon se milanaa or ajukeshan sector kii samasyaon ko samajhnaa shuru kiya
 When i saw the big aspect of the picture, i realized that my skills would not be better utilized by teaching
 main 20 saal ke apane bijness kariyar ke anubhavon kaa istemaal karke ajukeshan sector main vyavasthaagat badlaav karnaa chahta tha
 So, today i can use my skills of venture capitalist in CSF to look at a wide range of problems and solve them
 anbhavi kii salahsbase pehle apane kariyar main khub jokhim uthaaen
 Build confidence in yourself to do something different from others
 doosraa, mentres ko talaashen or unke saath aaajeevan dosti banaae rakhen
 Many people are ready to become mentors of youth
 mere teen menter hai, jo pichley 25 saal se mere saath hai, or unhone meri soch or kariyar ko kaaphi had tak prabhavit kiya he
 Third, study diligently
 khub padhein or achche objarwar bane
 You can learn a lot by watching in your life

 aaj maine film dekhi jabariyaa jodi or kya bataaen ki is film main kya he
 Story is required to make a film, which is not there in this one
 siddharth malhotra or pariniti chopra starer is film main bihar main hone vaali jabariyaa shaadiyon ke bare main dikhaaya gaya he
 The film stars Babli Yadav (parineeti Chopra)
 ve wo karti hai jo unke man main aae
 Is absolutely fearless
 duusari taraf hai abhaya singh (siddharth malhotra) jo shaadi or shraadh donon karavaate hai
 Abhay is domineering and is seen flaunting his bullying
 donon bachapan ke dost bhi hai, jinhen javaani main milte hi pyaar ho jaataa he
 Babli, who was celebrating her boyfriend's infidelity two moments ago, sees Abhay and expresses her love to him and starts decorating her wedding dreams
 abhaya babu sabakaa ghar jabardastee basaate hai, lekin apni baari main dar jate hai
 This film, based on the story of Abhay and Babli, goes from one place to another within a short time of its start and the sensation in it stops
 film kii kahani to dhundhani mushkil thi hi usapar siddharth malhotra or pariniti chopra kii acting bhi kisi julm se kam nahin he
 Yes, in between, Sanjay Mishra, Javed Jaffrey and Aparshakti Khurana come and make you feel good
 film ke panch or joke achche the haalanki wo is film batch nahin sake
 What director Prashant Singh was trying to create, it is very difficult to guess by looking at the forced pair
 film kaa vishay badhiya tha, agar isaki kahani ko dhang se parde par utaara gaya hota to ye kamaal kar sakati thi
 But seeing the film, it is clear that the makers could not understand how to do justice to this story
 siddharth or pariniti ke kirdaaron kii simple kahani ko itnaa uljhaayaa gaya ki ye film naa hui kisi ke phone kii uljhi hui hands-free ho gai, sulajhane kaa sawaal hi paidaa nahin hota
 The songs of the film are fine
 kul-milakar is film ko jhelana itnaa mushkil he ki agar koi aapako bandook ke jor par bhi ise dekhne ko bole to bhi aap aisa naa kar paaenge
 The film seems extremely difficult at the box office
 kul milakar lagata to yahi he ki siddharth or pariniti ke khate main jabariyaa jodi ke rup main ek or flop film shumaar ho gai

 The Supreme Court verdict on Maharashtra may come at 10:30 am on Tuesday
 isi bich NCP ke netaa ajit pavaar ko manaane main har koshish kar rahe hai
 In the morning, senior party leader Chhagan Bhujbal had come to convince Ajit Pawar and now the new Legislature Party leaders Jayant Patil and Chhagan Bhujbal and Dilip Valse have gone to meet Ajit Pawar at this time
 isse pehle sutron ke hawaale se khabar ai thi ki ajit pavaar ko waapas laane ke liye ensipi-shivasena dhai-dhai saal sarkaar chalaane ke liye taiyaar ho gai he
 But the question is when the NCP claims that it has the support of 53 mlas and the signature of mlas in the Raj Bhavan has been signed by 51 mlas
 baaki do vidhayak baad main dilli se mumbai aa gaye hai, to phir ajit pavaar se itani minnaten kyon kar rahi he? bataaya ja rahaa he ki jo netaa ajit pavaar ko manaane gaye hai wo ajit pavaar kii baatcheet party supremeo sharad pavaar se bhi phone par karaaen
 Actually there are speculations that the Supreme Court may ask to prove a majority in the House
 aise jo vidhayak abhi ensipi ke saath hone kaa daawa kar rahe hai vah sadan main kiske paksh main vot karenge is par kuch kaha nahin ja saktaa he
 Perhaps the NCP leaders feel that it may not happen that under the influence of Ajit Pawar, the mlas of the party should vote in favor of the government
 yahi kuch haal shivasena or congress ke netaaon kaa bhi he
 The legislators of both these parties are also kept in hotels
 vahiin ensipi ke vidhayakon ko teen alag-alag hotalon main tehraaya gaya he
 Let us tell you that in the Maharashtra Assembly elections, BJP has got 105 seats, Shiv Sena 56, NCP 54 and Congress 44 seats
 bijepi or shivasena ne milakar bahumat kaa 145 kaa aankada paar kar liya tha
 But Shiv Sena kept demanding 50-50 formula according to which the model of running the government was two and a half years
 shivasena kaa kahana he ki bijepi ke saath samjhauta isi formule par hua tha lekin bijepi kaa daawa he ki aisa koi samjhauta nahin hua
 This led to differences so much that the two-year old friendship of the two parties was broken
 iske baad kai daur kii baithkon ke baad congress-ncp or shivasena ne faisla kiya ki uddhav thakare kii aguwai main sarkaar banaai jaae or shanivaar ko teenon dal rajbhavan jaakar daawa pesh karne vaale the
 But the BJP overturned Ajit Pawar in the night and CM Devendra Fadnavis took oath at 8 am and Ajit Pawar became deputy CM with him
 ajit pavaar ne daawa kiya unke paas ensipi ke sabhi vidhayakon kaa samarthan he
 But later Sharad Pawar denied these things
 ab maamla supreme court pahunch gaya he or kal aane vaale faisle kaa intjaar he

 yahaan tak ki pakistan va bangladesh kii tulana main bharat kaa niryaat paanch or chaar guna zyada teji se gira he
 Entering within the data also shows that the decline in exports of manufactured products from India is faster than in emerging markets
 inamen oonchi keemat vaale transport, mashinari or electronics ko tagdi chot lagi he
 The rupee has lost nearly 24 percent against the dollar in the last three years
 aam taur par kamjor gharelu mudra niryaat kii badhat ke liye adarsh maani jaati he, alabatta kamjor hone ke baavjood bhartiya rupaya niryaat main pratispardhi deshon kii mudraon ke mukaable majboot he isliye niryaat gira he
 In such a situation, exporters needed government policy help which was not seen
 pratispardhaatmakataa main giravat niryaatkon ko lambey samay ke liye bazaar se baahar kar detii he, jiske chalate maang badhane ke baad bazaar main pair jamaana mushkil ho jaataa he
 The effect of decreasing competitiveness of Indian products is also reflected in imports
 vaanijya mantralay ke aankade bataate hai ki jab se global trade main susti shuru hui he, bharat kaa china se aayaat bad gaya he
 It has a higher share of manufactured goods
 matlab saaf he ki bhartiya utpaada niryaat va gharelu, donon hi bazaaron kii pratispardhaa main tik nahin paa rahe hai
 India's service exports are also downhill
 rigerv bank kaa taaja aankada bataata he ki farvari 2015 main sevaaon ke niryaat se praptiyon main 12
 55 per cent decline
 soochna takanic sevaaon ke niryaat main growth bani hui he lekin raftaar gir rahi he
 Two weeks ago in the same column, we wrote that the government figures prove that free trade agreements are the biggest means of increasing foreign trade, however, the Narendra Modi government is more conservative about this liberalization
 mukt vyapaar kii disha main ruke kadam niryaat main giravat kii badi vajah hai
 India's textile and apparel exports are the latest example of this confusion
 kapadaa niryaat main bharat ab pakistan se bhi peeche ho gaya he
 In 2014, Pakistan became part of the European Union's preferred trade system and with this, textile exporters found around 37 large markets where they are exporting without paying import duty
 coton textile exports association ke aankade bataate hai ki bharat kareeb 19 kapadaa or 18 paridhaan utpaadon kaa bazaar pakistan ke haathon kho chukaa he
 To return to this market, India needs a trade agreement with the European Community
 kapadaa niryaat un kai mahatvapurn kshetron main ek he jahaan niryaat rojgaron kaa sabase bada madhyam he
 a large part of India's exports come from labor-based industries, in addition to textiles, handicrafts, gemstone jewelry etc
 hakeekat yah he ki bharat kaa 45 fisadi niryaat choti or majholi ikaiyaan karti hai, niryaat ghatane ke kaaran bekaari bad rahi he or naukariyon ke sankat ko gaharaa kar rahi he
 Foreign trade has emerged as a policy weakness of the Modi government
 pradhanmantri modi ke global abhiyaanon kii roshni main dekhne par yah badahaali or mukhar hokar saamne aati he
 There is no concrete strategy to increase exports in the last two years
 duusari taraf, yah asamanjas or gadha hota gaya he ki bharat darasal videsh vyapaar ke udaarikaran ke haq main he yaa bazaar ko band hi rakhana chahta he
 There is a lot of anger among the government representatives about the Reserve Bank Governor's well-being on the data of economic growth rate
 alabatta is kshobh kaa thodaa-sa hissaa bhi agar niryaat kii phikr main lag jaae to shaayad is morche par paanch saal kii sabase kharaab surat badalane kii ummid ban sakati he

 What happened on 20 August 2013? i went to Gadchiroli, Maharashtra to meet Magsaysay award-winning doctor and social worker Prakash Amte
 wo bhamragarh main lok birdari aspataal chalaate hai jo sthaneey logon ke bich kaam karti he
 On 20 August 2013, i landed at Bhallarshah at nine thirty
 yahaan se mujhe bhamragarh ke liye bas leni thi
 (see also map of India while reading) During this time some people caught me from behind
 wo log sade kapadon main the
 i was startled, scared too
 chillane kii bhi koshish kii lekin kuch hi der main wo mujhe khinchate hue railway stesan ke baahar laae
 About 20 people pushed me in a Tata Sumo standing there
 gaadi ke andar pitayee shuru
 He was killing anywhere, howsoever
 jab unhone meraa purse chhina to laga chor hai kuch lootnaa chaahate hai
 One hour later one of them said, 'you want to know who we are, then he showed his ID
 tab mujhe pataa chalaa ki wo log gatchiroli special branch ke log the
 'after endless rounds of torture, they blindfolded me
 maine unase kaha ki main jeenyu kaa chaatr hum
 i showed my ID
 lekin wo to jaise sunne ko hi taiyaar na the
 They started pressuring me that i should accept silently what they say
 unhone mujhe kaha ki tum sweekaar karo ki tum naksalwadi netaaon se milane ja rahe ho
 If you did not accept, then understand the consequences
 dhaai teen ghante baad gaadi ruki
 The place was like a military camp
 vahaan wo mujhe ek kamare main le gaye
 There i saw a board on which the name was written Shuez Haq
 mujhe baad main pataa chalaa ki wo haq sahab gatchiroli ke espi the
 He also threatened me to accept what we said
 pulisia bajirao yani torchar20 agast se lagaataar 80 ghante yani lagbhag teen din tak unhone mujhe bilkul sone nahin diya
 During this time he used to kick me, give dirty abuses and besides that he had his Bajirao

 Which he greatly glamorized
 us pattee kii khaasiyat yah hoti he ki usase chot to bahut lagati he lekin jakhm nahin hota

 unhone mujhase kaha ki mujhe yah baat sweekaar kerani hogi ki main maovadi commander narmada se milane ja rahaa tha
 If this was a sheer lie, there was no question of accepting it
 wo maarthe ja rahe the lekin main ye kaise sweekaar karata
 In the meantime, i was threatened with an encounter, threatening to put petrol in Ennis too
 naksaliyon kaa dress bhi pahanaaya gaya or kaha gaya ki ye pahanaakar encounter kar denge kisi ko pataa nahin chalegaa
 During this time, no one in my home nor college knew where i was

 BJP spokesman Rajuv Pratap Rudy rejected Mani Shankar Aiyar's statement, saying, "no better statement can be imagined by Mani Shankar Iyer

 " By the way, the BJP also said that the party did not declare Rahul Gandhi as the prime ministerial candidate, because he does not want Rahul to directly compete with Narendra Modi, because he knows that Rahul will lose

 The by-elections have always been a challenge for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which performed brilliantly in the last Assembly and Lok Sabha elections in Uttar Pradesh

 The saffron party has won only three of these - Lucknow East, Noida and Saharanpur

 The BJP lost the Lok Sabha by-elections in Gorakhpur, Phulpur and Kairana

 The strategy of state organization General Secretary Sunil Bansal, who was the architect of bjp's golden performance in the last UP assembly and Lok Sabha elections, was also lost in the Lok Sabha by-elections
 aise main ye upachunaav bansal ke kaushal kii pariksha bhi lenge
 On August 13, at a meeting with party leaders at the state BJP headquarters, Bansal drew a blueprint for BJP getting more than 51 percent of the votes in the assembly by-elections
 loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan jin boothon par bhaajapa ko paraajay mili he, un par vishesh abhiyaan chalaakar sthaneey sameekaran durust karne kii ranneeti banaai gai he
 In the Lok Sabha elections held in May, eight BJP mlas have won elections and become mps

 One assembly seat fell vacant after the BJP MLA was convicted by the Supreme Court and one seat became the Governor of the BJP MLA (see graphics)
 is tarah kul 13 siton par vidhansabha upachunaav kii jang kaa maidan taiyaar ho chukaa he
 Since the High Court has considered the Hamirpur Assembly seat vacant since April 19, there is a compulsion to conduct the elections within six months
 aise main sambhaavna he ki pradesh kii sabhi khaali vidhansabha siton par 19 aktubar ke pehle upachunaav sampann ho jaaenge
 Ajit Kumar, professor in the sociology department of Banaras Hindu University, says, "the by-elections are falling right in the middle of the tenure of the Yogi government, which will also be a measure of public mood towards the functioning of the BJP government in the state
" ''tikat ke liye maaramaribhajapa ke liye sabase zyada dikkatein upachunaav ke tikat ke daavedaaron ne badhaai hai
 The Balha assembly seat vacated by Akshaywarlal Gaur, BJP MP from Bahraich, has more than a dozen contenders, including his son Anand Gaur, Manish Arya, son of Gajadhar Prasad, a three-time MLA from Jana Sangh
 kanpur kii govindnagar seat se vidhayak rahe satyadev pachori ke saansad banane ke baad is seat par unke putr anup pachori, kanpur uttar ke bhaajapa adhyaksh surendra maithani, purv vidhayak niraj chaturvedi tikat par daawa thonk rahe hai
 After Rita Bahuguna Joshi, an MLA from Lucknow Cantt, became the MP, Joshi's supporters are demanding that her son Mayank Joshi be given a ticket
 bhaajapa ke ek pradesh mahaamantri bataate hai, ''vidhansabha upachunaav kii har seat par bhaajapa kaa tikat maangane waalon kii sankhya 10 se adhik he
 "to avoid the hue and cry over ticket distribution, the BJP core group has decided not to give tickets to the sons-daughters or relatives of mla-turned-politicians
" bhaajapa ne upachunaav vaali 12 vidhansabha siton (ghosi ko chhodkar) par pradesh sarkaar ke 13 mantriyon ko prabharee banaaya he

 The BJP has tried to balance the local social equation by appointing Dalit cabinet minister Ramapathi Shastri in the Yogi government on Balha (reserved) seat and Upendra Tiwari, minister of state for Brahmin (independent charge)
 bhaajapa ke liye rampur or jalalapur sabase kathin vidhansabha siten hai
 The charge of Jalalpur seat has been assigned to Cabinet Minister Brijesh Pathak
 ruhelkhand vishvavidhyalay se ritair praadhyaapak mohammad ajijul haleem bataate hai, ''bhaajapa muslim bahulya rampur vidhansabha seat ko keval ek sthiti main jeet sakati he jab basapa or congress se majboot ummidavaar khadey hon jinke bich muslim maton kaa bantwaaraa ho jaae
 Otherwise this seat is a safe seat for SP
 ''sapa-basapa ke liye chunautisapa ke saath milakar loksabhaa chunaav ladgaye vaali basapa ne usase gathbandhan todgaye ke baad pehali baar vidhansabha upachunaav ladgaye kaa faisla kiya he
 Manish Hindavi, associate professor in the economics department of Lucknow University, says, "having won 10 seats in the Lok Sabha, Mayawati also wants to show that she has won the Lok Sabha seats on her own, by doing well in the by-elections
 mayawati basapa ko bhaajapa ke mukaable mukhya vipakshi party bhi sabit karnaa chaahati hai
 Mayawati realizes that the BSP got a large share of Muslim votes only due to the alliance with the SP in the Lok Sabha elections
 dalit-muslim gathjod ne hi basapa kii siton ko sapa se doguna kar diya
 To test this strategy in a by-election, Mayawati handed over the chair of the state BSP president to former Rajya Sabha MP Munkad Ali
 ali ne vidhansabha upachunaav vaale kshetron main maujuuda yaa purv ke sabase varisht basapa padaadhikari ko sector prabharee bananaa shuru kar diya he
 Among the 13 seats where the assembly by-elections are to be held, in the 2017 assembly elections, the BSP and Congress were second in the 4-4 and SP 3 seats
 is lihaaj se sapa kii chunauti in upachunaavon main or bhi bad gai he
 In view of the preparations for the by-elections, the SP has started a special membership campaign among the Dalit and Backward Class voters
 sapa ke mukhya pravaktaa rajendra choudhary kehete hai, ''upachunaav vaale vidhansabha kshetron main booth samitiyon ke gathan kaa kaam jald hi puraa hoga
 The SP, which defeated the BJP in the last Lok Sabha by-election, is once again hoping for a good performance in these by-elections
 iske liye sapa ne chote dalon suheldev bhartiya samaaj party, pis party, apana dal (krishna gut) se sampark kar sthaneey jati sameekaran saadhane kii koshish shuru kar di he
 The most pathetic condition is that of the Congress, which has been reduced to one MP in the state
 uskaa pradesh sanghathan bhang he
 In such a situation, the preparations of the Congress for the by-elections are fully dependent on the National General Secretary and in-charge of Eastern UP Priyanka Gandhi
 loksabhaa chunaav main munh kii khaane vaali partiyon ke liye vidhansabha upachunaav apni siyaasi pakad jaahir karne kaa ek mauka he
 If she misses it then her road to the 2022 assembly elections could be very difficult

 On Friday, Rahul tweeted that since Modi government has come, he is saying that he will bring black money, whereas now in 2018, when the capital has increased there, he is saying that it is all white money

 com / 7aigt529st — Rahul Gandhi (@rahulgandhi) June 29, 2018 The party released the old video, let me tell you that even before this, the Congress party had surrounded the Modi government on this issue by holding a press conference
 congress ne shuukravaar ko ek video jari karte hue pradhanmantri narendra modi ko nishane par liya
 This video is before Narendra Modi became Prime Minister, in which he is saying how the rupee is falling against the dollar and all this is happening due to the corrupt government at the center
 congress netaa arpyen sinhane kaha ki jab narendra modi vipaksh main the, tab vah tatkaaleen pradhanmantri manmohan singh kaa majaak udaate the, kya hamen bhi ab aisa hi karnaa chahie
 He said that during the campaign he had promised 15 lakh rupees, but when he came to power it became a jumla
 gauratlab he ki swiss bank ne jo taaja aankade jari kiye hai usamen dikh rahaa he ki pichley ek saal main bharatiyon kii jamaa puunji main kareeb 50% kii badhotaree hui he
 These figures had been steadily declining for the last three years, but such a sudden jump in 2017 could raise concerns for the Modi government
 vipaksh ke alaava kai saathiyon ne bhi isko lekar sarkaar ko gheraa he

 -input IANS On May 19, the day of the Assam election results, the BJP was immersed in celebration, but the party's national president Amit Shah had his eyes fixed on Arjun's eyes
 jehan main uttar pradesh kaa vidhansabha chunaav tha
 And late in the evening they took the decision
 fouran pradesh adhyaksh keshav prasad maury ko farmaan sunaaya gaya ki rashtriya kaaryakarini kii baithak elahabaad main hogi
 The only example of Shah's flirtation with UP is that he often tells his colleagues, "to win 2019, it is necessary to win UP
 " uttar pradesh kii ahmiyat shah kii saakh se judi he kyonki tamaam vivaadaaspad prishthbhumi ke baavjood bijepi kii sheersh kursi tak pahunchane main upi kaa sabase bada yogadan he
 In such a situation, if the BJP does not win the fort of UP, then the image of Shah emerged as a skilled strategist will collapse
 shaayad tabhi janvari main jab shah kii duusari baar tajposhi kii charchaa chal rahi thi, to bijepi kii upi ikai kii ore se sanghathan kaa chunaav karaane ke anurodh par unhone kaha tha, ''pehle mere adhyaksh pad kaa chunaav ho jane do, phir upi ke bare main sochoongaa
 "A strategist who knows Shah closely," says UP, has a different blueprint in his mind that he hardly likes to share with anyone before he embodies it
 "lekin upi kaa mahatv bijepi kii modi-shah kii jodi ke liye kitna ahm he, iskaa andaja is baat se bhi lagaaya ja saktaa he ki modi sarkaar ke ek saal puraa hone par upi ke mathura main to doosraa saal puraa hone par saharanpur main raily kii gai
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ambitious Farmers Crop Insurance Scheme was launched from Bareilly and Ballia district of Purvanchal was selected for launching the Ujjwala scheme
 rashtriya kaaryakarini ke liye bhi elahabaad kaa chayan kiya gaya jo bijepi kii raajnneeti ke lihaaj se atyant hi pichhadaa kshetra rahaa he
 The bjp's strategy behind this is to create a saffron atmosphere in UP within the next three months
 lekin modi-shah kii jodi ko bihar chunaav ne ehsaas kara diya he ki maahaul bananaa or jamini str par use voton main tabdeel kara paanaa aasaan nahin he
 Therefore, the party has stepped up its work on an effective strategy, keeping itself in the competition and looking after the post-election equation
 party kyon chaahati he sapa se muqablabihar chunaav ke nateezon ke baad se hi upi main bispi ke paksh main maahaul banane laga tha
 But BJP wants its fight to be seen with SP
 shah khud saarvajanik manchon se lagaataar bispi ko khaarij kar sapa se ladaai kii baat kar rahe hai
 Even in internal meetings, Shah says that BJP does not compete with BSP as it did not get a single seat in Lok Sabha
 haalanki aisa kehete hue ve mayawati ko mili 20 fisadi voton ke tathy ko andekha karte hai
 Actually, there is a strategy behind this: BJP wants to create an environment that makes people feel that BSP is not in the fight so that its direct benefit will be given to the party
 vajah? upi main aksar yah dekhne ko mila he ki sapa ke kamjor hone kaa phayda bispi ko miltaa he
 a senior BJP leader reveals something about this strategy in this way, "SP is the ruling party, it can be polarized only in the event of a contest and most importantly, BJP from BSP if it becomes a hung assembly after elections An alliance is possible, not possible with SP
 " haalanki bijepi ke ek anya ranneetikaar kaa maananaa he ki agar musalmaan bispi kii ore nahin gaya to party kaa muqabla sapa se hona tay he
 bjp's three-tier strategy: BJP is working on electoral strategy by dividing Uttar Pradesh into six zones
 lekin uski ranneeti tristareey he
 In Purvanchal, where the BJP is in a very weak position, where the party is fully adopting the caste equation, polarization will be its main weapon in western UP
 vikaas kaa mudda upi ke sabase pichde kshetra bundelkhand main aajamaaya jayega
 In this, the party will first try to publicize the functioning of the Modi government at the center, as if the country is seeing a change, but due to the SP government in UP, the people are not getting the benefit of the central schemes
 iske alaava purna parivartan ke sandesh ke tahat party pichley 14-15 saal ke sapa-bispi raaj main bhrashtachar, apradheekaran or sampradayikta ko tathyon ke saath rakhane kii disha main kaam kar rahi he
 Also, the party is not in a mood to give up any issue related to polarization
 isliye party ne pehle kairana se kathith hindu palaayan kaa mudda uchhaala to baad main use kanoon-vyavastha se jodakar pradesh sarkaar kii vifaltaa se jod diya
 The BJP wants the contest to be SP vs BJP so that it gets the natural benefit of the sp's domination and its image that promotes criminals
 isliye party ne mathura or kairana kii ghatana ko puure pradesh main purajor dhang se oochaal diya he
 The party created a separate email id regarding illegal possession, on which the party has received more than 1,200 complaints so far
 in jagahon par bijepi aarpaar ke sangharsh kii ranneeti bana rahi he or upi main ''khun se ranga mathura, so rahi sarkaarya ke naaron ke saath hordings-poster laga die gaye hai
 The trend of polarization is being spread by the BJP, which is trying to catch the pulse of the public which allegedly only instigates the feeling of hearing of Muslims and Yadavs during the SP government
 bijepi ke ek varisht ranneetikaar ke shabdon main, ''chunaav main jab tak sidhaa dhruvikaran nahin hoga bijepi apana dam nahin dikhaa paaegi
 "but the bjp's polarization card has collapsed in the Bihar elections
 isliye party is mudde ko lekar thodi asahaj bhi he
 a senior BJP leader recalls, "when the elections were held in 1993 after the disputed structure was demolished in Ayodhya, Kalyan Singh was a symbol of that whole development but in that election the party came down from 221 seats to 177 seats
 " is netaa kaa maananaa he ki jab dhruvikaran ke charam par bhi party chunaav na jeet saki to ab dhruvikaran ke sahare satta kaa sapana dekhnaa galatfahami hogi
 However, on 27 June, in a conference of booth workers of Awadh area in Barabanki, Shah linked Kairana to the Hindu migration, the laptop scheme of the SP government also raised the issue of giving preference to the same community in jobs
 unhone do took kaha, ''sab kuch ek hi sampradaay ko milegaa to baaki log kahaan jaaenge?" bijepi is mudde par july main ram mandir ko lekar supreme court main hone vaali sunwaayee kaa bhi intjaar kar rahi he
 The bjp's difficulty in ending the 14-year exile in the Mahabharat UP on the faces of the Chief Minister is the difficulty of the BJP
 itane lambey samay tak rajya kii satta se maharoom party main aisa koi vyaktitv nahin jo maaya-mulaayam ke saamne khadaa ho sake
 Out of the two old faces that the party hopes to live on, Kalyan Singh has gone to the Governor's line and Rajnath Singh is the Union Home Minister
 rajnath ko mukhyamantri kaa ummidavaar banane ko lekar charchaa khub he par party main na to koi uski pushti karne ko taiyaar he or na hi khaarij karne ko
 However, the final decision in this regard will be at the level of the Sangh and Prime Minister Modi
 lekin rajnath ko mukhyamantri pad kaa ummidavaar banane kaa maamla atyant samvedansheel hoga kyonki isse kendriya raajnneeti main nakaaratmak sandesh ja saktaa he
 If he is sent to UP, the modi-shahki duo could be accused of sidelining senior leaders because he had been the CM 16 years ago and had conducted two Lok Sabha elections as the National Speaker
 lekin unhen bhejne se pradesh main party kii gambhirtha dikhegi or maaya-mulaayam ke mukaable majboot chehre kaa sankat bhi khatm ho jayega
 But according to sources, Rajnath is not at all keen on going into state politics because if lost, all the fine will behead him and modi-shah, who sits on bjp's top power through UP, will be saved from responsibility
 haalanki rajnath ke alaava party kii dhruvikaran kii raajnneeti main sabase mufeed cheharaa gorakhpur se saansad yogi adityanath bhi hai, jinako lekar party main gambhirtha se charchaa ho rahi he
 Varun Gandhi and Human Resource Development Minister Smriti Irani, who do not fit into the mold of the social equation, seem to be mobilizing for themselves
 haalanki upi se jude kareeb ek darjan kendriya mantriyon main zyadatar aaayaatit chehre hai jo ab upi kaa netritv kar rahe hai
 In such a situation, it will also be interesting to see whether the state will be led by the original UP or any external
 party agar koi cheharaa project nahin karti he to uski sabase badi chunauti pradhanmantri modi ke chehre par daanv khelnaa hoga
 Despite Modi's blistering rally in Bihar, the party's backward fall in the results raised questions on his credibility, after which the party played a successful bet on the local face in Assam
 sutron kii maane to upi main pradhanmantri kii reliyaan bihar kii tarah nahin hongi
 Fueled by the bouquet of social engineering and leadership, the BJP has moved towards creating a big bouquet of social equations and alliances
 pradesh adhyaksh kii niyukti main party ne purvanchal ke obisi netaa keshav prasad maury par daanv khelaa, lekin ab tak ke anubhav main vah card bahut mufeed sabit nahin hua he
 The resentment among the upper castes had increased the party's concern with the way the party insisted on the obc-dalit
 lihaaja party ne musalmaan chehre mukhtaar abbaas nakvi ko jharkhand se rajyasabha bhejkar pratikatmak brahman chehre shiv pratap shukla ko rajyasabha saansad banaaya
 Now if the party projects CM then it can also be upper caste
 soshal ejineering kaa guladasta khud shah ne taiyaar kiya he, jinhone loksabhaa chunaav main bataur prabharee mahasachiv 20 fisadi muslim voton ko chhodkar savarna, pichhadaa or daliton ke 80 fisadi vot ko target kiya tha
 And the NDA won 73 out of 80 seats in the Modi wave
 haalanki is baar bijepi ne saamaajik sameekaran main bhi micromanagement kiya he
 Apart from the 20 per cent Muslim vote, the party has been able to unite the rest of the Dalit-backward votes in its favor, leaving around 10 per cent Yadav and 10-11 per cent Jatav votes
 obisi ke kurmi vot bank main aadhaar rakhane vaale apana dal ke saath bijepi kaa gathbandhan pehle se hi he or ab party rajbhar samet kareeb darjan bhar choti partiyon ke saath sampark main he
 Most of these are proposed by the party for merger and the merger will be aligned with those whose vote will not be transferred
 dalit vot bank main send lagane ke liye party ne buddha bhikshuon ko aage kar dhamm chetana yatra shuru kii he jo buddha viharon main jaakar bijepi ke liye vot maang rahe hai
 The BJP has taken special care of the social equation in all its six zones, from the appointment of regional presidents to the lower level team
 isi sameekaran ke lihaaj se sabhi siton par 5-6 naamon kaa panel bhi taiyaar kar liya he
 Under this strategy, caste equation has also been kept in a booth, ten youth formulas and in the coming time, the process of caste conventions will be intensified
 sambhavit mantrimandal pherbadal man bhi is sameekaran kii jhalak dikhegi
 It includes names like Anupriya Patel, Yogi Adityanath, Rajveer Singh, Krishna Raj and Kaushal Kishore
 lekin bijepi kii chintaa is baat ko lekar bad gai he ki sapa kaa congress ke saath kahin andruni samjhauta ho jaataa he or areldi uskaa hissaa ban jaati he to musalmaan matadaataaon ko spasht vikalp dikhegaa
 Not only this, unlike sp's bullying image, Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav's personal image is not of Bahubali or Dabangg
 aise main chunaav vyaktitv par hota he to akhilesh bijepi kii badi chunauti banakar ubharenge
 Organizational strengthening is the original mantra of "booth won, won the election"
 upi main kareeb 1
 There are 40 lakh booths out of which BJP 1
 10 lakh booth tak sanghathan durust karne kaa kaam puraa kar liya he or ab kshetravaar booth sammelnon ko khud shah sambodhit kar rahe hai
 There will be legislative conference after that
 bijepi kaa daawa he ki upi main uske sadasyon kii sankhya 2 karod ke paar he, jinamein se 1
 Records with 40 crore names and addresses are with the party
 shah upi chunaav ko loksabhaa chunaav se aasaan maanate hai
 The reason for this is that during the Lok Sabha, the party had access to 10 mps and 32 per cent booths, which has now reached 73 mps and 87 per cent booths
 saansadon ko bhi ab maheene main 10 din sanghathan ke kaarykram ke hisaab se pravaas karne ke nirdesh die gaye hai
 Shah has made the system active till the booth by drawing up a board-level executive within 21 days of the national executive
 jaahir he ki jis upi ne shah kaa rashtriya adhyaksh ke taur par rajarohan kiya, vahi ab ranneetik kushalta kaa imtihaan legaa
 Not only this, this election will also prove to be a litmus test of the functioning of the Modi government

 ek nae janatam surveykshan main bahusankhyak americanyon ne baraak obama se bas ek kaarykaal tak hi raashtrapati rahane kii apeksha kii he
 In such a situation, Obama has described himself as a weak candidate, because the bad economy is weakening the prospects of his re-election in 2012
 abisi news ne somvaar ko jab obama se poocha ki kya kharaab arthvyavastha ke kaaran navambar 2012 main paristhiti unke vipareet rahegi, to obama ne kaha, "nischitarup se
 I'm getting weak
 lekin din samaapt hone par log sawaal karte hai- yah drushti kisne di?" obama ne kaha ki america janata aaj utani behatar sthiti main nahin he, jitani behatar sthiti main chaar varsh pehle thi
 Obama said, "the unemployment rate has become very high
 " nau pratishat kii berogari dar aadhi se adhik sadi ke dauraan kii sabase oonchi dar he
 Since the employment approval rate hovers around 40 percent, Obama will not be too weak in the 2012 election
 lekin unhone 2012 ke chunaav ko 'mulyon or drushtiyon' kaa ek chunaav bataaya, or kaha ki yah chunaav is mudde par ek janamat sangrah bhi hoga ki kya sarkaar ko shiksha va adhosanrachana main dirghakaalik sudhaaron main is samay nivesh karnaa chahie yaa nahin
 Meanwhile, according to another poll conducted by ABC News / Washington Post, only 37 percent of Americans want Obama to be re-elected in the November 2012 election, while 55 percent of Americans want a Republican candidate to win
 democrate obama kii jeet to chaahate hai, lekin aisa chaahane waalon kaa pratishat keval 58-33 hi he, jo ki party ke bheetar obama ke prati apekshaakrit kamjor bharose ko jaahir karata he
 Republicans, by contrast, are confident of winning 83–13 percent of their candidates

 kuch chauke or chakke jadte hue unhone balle kaa munh kholaa hi tha ki 29 ran par tej gendbaaj trent bolt kaa shikaar ban gaye
 The disappointment of not redeeming this golden opportunity could be read clearly on his face
 gambhir kii pareshaaniyaan abhi khatm nahin hui thim, newjiland kii pari ke dauraan fielding karte hue ve daayan kandhaa chotil kar baithe the
 Even during India's second innings on Sunday, he had to dive while running
 nateeja phir usee kandhe par chot
 The physio was called on the ground but Gautam was unable to rotate his shoulder properly
 unhen ritair hona padaa
 Given the kind of injury Gambhir had, he was unlikely to come down for batting on the fourth day of the match

 After India's first wicket fell as Murali Vijay, he again landed for batting, then a wave of happiness ran in the audience

 Senior Bihar BJP leader Sushil Modi recently accused Lalu Prasad Yadav of a number of scams
 unhone isse jude dastavej bhi media main jari kiye the
 Now Sushil Modi has also come under target of Tejashwi Yadav
 fasebuk par tejasvi ne likhaa he susheel modi par rajd ne jitne bhi aarope lagaae hai us vah kumbhakarni neend soe hue hai
 By pretending to be a monk himself, he dodges the morality and honesty, but does not speak a word nor give any explanation on the corruption prevailing in his house
 tejasvi yadav ne susheel modi se 7 sawaal puche hai

Why does his tongue stop when he answers the allegations against him? 2- lalit chhachavariyaa jaise mani londring ke betaj baadshahon kaa unke bhai kii company se kya lenaa dena he? aarake modi ke lalit chhachavariyaa se vyavsaayik sambandh hai ki nahin? 3

 Since then, the atmosphere of chaos
 kahin gaadi kii keemat se zyaada kaa chaalaan kaata ja rahaa he
 So, due to challan cutting, angry people are setting their vehicles on fire
 to kahin kisi ko chaalaan kii rakam bharne main do-do maheene kii tankhwaah chali ja rahi he
 But the whole country was stunned when news of this challan of death came
 noida-ghaziabad road par ek trephic police vaale ne 35 saal ke ek shaks kaa aisa chaalaan kaata ki thik usee jagah uski jaan chali gai
 What were these less before
 jo ab sarkaar ne inhen chaalaan ke naam par logon ko luutane kaa license bhi de diya
 Now it seems that this is the road master who has stopped thinking
 jise chaha chaalaan ke naam par hadakaane lage
 Started bullying
 manamaane niyam kanoon bataakar chaalaan kii raseeden pakadaane lage
 Challans of more than the number of people whose carts were not started were cut across the country
 dar gaye log, sach main dar gaye
 Who are sitting on the driving seat of the car even with full documents
 unke bhi dil jor jor se dhadak rahe hai
 It is just a matter of fear that the challan is not cut
 ye khauf is kadar tari he ki sadak par trephic police waalon ko dekhakar hi log dil pakadakar baith ja rahe hai
 And if these policemen are stopping vehicles, then their condition is deteriorating
 ghaziabad or noida ko milaane vaali ek road par jab ek pulisavaale ne sharma ji ke bete kii is gaadi par danda maaraa to wo is khauf main aa gaya ki naa jane usase kya galati ho gai
 Moreover, the UP16-AC-0290 number was intercepted by the vehicle as if the terrorists were not sitting in the train
 driving seat par baithe moolchand sharma ke bete gaurav kaa to halak hi suukh gaya
 Did not know what this police will do now
 abhi baat kar hi rahe the ki achaanak seene main dard uththa
 Went to heart or kadamon ne jism ko uthaane se inkaar kar diya
 Gaurav came down on his knees
 dil kaa daura padaa tha
 The breath had stopped
 ek bebas baap badahavaas tha
 Raise your son lying on the ground
 yaa sadame main aa gai apni patni ko sanbhale
 The Bedil traffic policeman was taking pictures of the car instead of lifting the pride on the ground
 is manzar ko dekhakar bhi koi rahagir madad ko raji naa hua
 The son was rubbing heels on the road
 or baap kabhi zamin par pade bete ko uthaata
 Once upon a time, he would take care of an unconscious wife
 jaise taise ek shaks madad ko raji hua
 With his help, the father placed the son in the car
 maa uske seene ko sahala rahi thi
 Bad father could not understand where to go
 us madadgaar shaks ne gaadi sanbhali or gaurav ko lekar nazadik ke fortis hospital le gaya
 The hospital's emergency ward refused to admit after seeing Gaurav's condition
 sector 62 se gaadi ko kailash aspataal kii taraf modaa gaya
 Where after 10 to 20 minutes of investigation, he was told to go through this world of his son
 baap ke pairon ke neeche se zamin khisak gai
 Moolchand Sharma, who retired from Army School, could not understand what happened to him in a moment
 achche bhale bete ne unki ankhon se saamne dam tod diya
 His son, who was just 35, was married just a few years ago
 5 saal kii maasoom bacchee he uski
 But the biggest issue was still left for one father
 use ye khabar us bete kii maa ko deni thi
 Which kept him in his womb
 paala-posa bada kiya
 He still had to give this news to his wife
 jo uske waapas ghar lautne kii raah tak rahi thi
 And he had to give this news to the innocent girl who does not sleep without placing the head on her chest
 hai ye ek baap kis kis ko ye kalejaa chaak kar dene vaali khabar sunaae
 Whom to handle
 kis kis ko dilasa de
 How could he handle himself? yakeenan bahut tadapaa hoga wo baap
 But he has absorbed all his sorrow in his chest
 kyonki ise ab bahut lanbaa safar tay karnaa he
 It is to bear the responsibility of his son's wife and children on these old shoulders

 vishwa hindu parishad kii netaa sadhvi praachi ke ‘muslim mukt bharat’ sambandhi bayaan ko lekar aaj jammu-kashmir vidhansabha main jamkar hangaamaa hua

 mumbai or maharashtra main media kaa kaam kathin hone vaala he
 Especially in cases involving crime
 maharashtra sarkaar ne bombai hoicourt me ek halafanama daayar kar bataaya he ki aaropee or peedit kii niztaa banaae rakhane ke liye police ko disha-nirdesh jari kiya he, jisamen aaropee kaa naam, uski tasviir or usase judi koi bhi jaankaree media ko dene ke liye manaa kiya gaya he
 The affidavit was given in response to a PIL filed in the Bombay High Court
 janhit yachika daayar karne vaale vakil rahul thakur ke mutabik, kisi par bhi maamla darj hote hi police uski puri jaankaree, tasviir media ko de detii he
 The result is that the person is considered a criminal even before he is proved guilty, which is injustice
 rajya sarkaar ke halafname main 15 disha-nirdesh die gaye hai, jisamen aaropee ke saath peedit or uske parivaar kii jaankaree dene par bhi roak lagaai gai he
 Along with this, the confessional statement of the accused, arms and other items seized from him have also been asked not to be given to the media
 or to or hatya ke maamle main mritak kii tasviir bhi media ko dene par roak lagaai gai he
 According to this, it is to be done till the charge sheet in that case is filed and all the accused are caught
 aise main sawaal uthanaa lajimi he ki kahin ye media trial ke naam par media par pabandi kii koshish to nahin? varisht patrkaar jatin desai kaa kahana he ki is tarah kii pabandi paardarshita khatm karti he
 Citing the 1993 Mumbai serial blasts, Jatin Desai asks if there are still many accused absconding in that case, shall we not report it? desai ke mutabik, is tarah kii pabandi ke pehle sarkaar media kaa paksh bhi jaan leti to acha hota
 RTI activist Anil Galgali has called it an attempt to strangle the media
 galgali kaa kahana he aropiyon ko benakaab karne se unamem bhay paidaa hota he or aparaadh par roak lagati he or media tabhi khabar chalaati he jab police maamla darj karti yaa phir kisi ko giraftaar karti he
 Galgali's question is why does the police arrest the wrong man? jabaki purv ipies sudhakar suradkar kaa kahana he ki jab ham haq kii baat karte hai to ferj bhi samajhnaa hoga
 This type of ban is necessary in matters related to national security, but not in all cases
 khaas baat he ki media hi nahin kai police vaale bhi is paripatrak ko puri tarah se thik nahin maanate
 He says that in many cases of murder, the identity of the deceased is due to the media
 bina shinaakht ke hatya kii gutthi sulajhaai nahin ja sakati
 The comments sawaal is baat par bhi uth rahaa he ki agar roak lagaani he to dosha sabit hone tak kyon nahin? sirf aarope patr daayar hone tak hi kyon? uske baad bhi to kai aaropee chhot jate hai
 Then will there be no injustice to him? Nonetheless, the ban is on giving some specific information to the media
 media main chhapane par nahin isliye ise media par pabandi to nahin kahenge, lekin ye media ko kaaphi had tak soochna dene se rokane kii koshish jarur he
 It is also true that the rights of the accused and the victim should be taken care of, but at the same time it is also necessary to see that there will be transparency in the investigation or else the influential people will not desist from meeting the police and hugging the case
 aakhir kai aise maamle hai, jo media kii vajah se hi anjaam tak pahunch paae hai
 Therefore a watchman like media is also necessary
 yah halafanama bombai hoicourt main daayar ek janhit yachika ke jawaab main diya gaya he
 According to lawyer Rahul Thakur, who filed a public interest litigation, the police give his complete information and photo to the media as soon as a case is registered
 nateeja ye hota he ki dosha sabit hone ke pehle hi vah shaks apradhi maan liya jaataa he, jo anyaay he
 The state government's affidavit contains 15 guidelines, which prohibit information on the victim and his family along with the accused
 iske saath hi aaropee kaa ikbaalia bayaan, uske paas se jabt hathiyaar or duusare saamaanon kii tasviir bhi media ko nahin dene ke liye kaha gaya he
 Moreover, in the case of murder, the photo of the deceased has also been prohibited from being given to the media
 iske mutabik, aisa tab tak karnaa he jab tak us maamle main aarope patr daayar na ho jaae or sabhi aaropee pakad na liye jaaen
 In such a situation, the question arises that is there an attempt to ban the media in the name of this media trial? Senior journalist Jatin Desai says such a ban ends transparency
 1993 main hue mumbai serial bam dhamaakon kaa hawala dete hue jatin desai poochhate hai ki us maamle main to ab bhi kai aaropee faraar hai to kya ham uski reporting hi na karen? According to Desai, it would have been good if the government had known the media's side before such a ban
 artiai kaaryakarta anil galgali ne to ise media kaa galaa ghontne kii koshish qaraar diya he
 Galgali says exposing the accused creates fear in them and stops the crime and the media only reports when the police register a case or arrest someone
 galgali kaa sawaal he police galat aadmi ko giraftaar hi kyon karti he? Whereas former IPS Sudhakar Suradkar says that when we talk of rights, duty also has to be understood
 rashtriya suraksha se jude maamalon me is tarahan kii pabandi jaruri he, lekin sabhi maamalon main nahin
 The special thing is that not only the media but also many policemen do not consider this circular to be completely correct
 unka kahana he ki hatya ke kai maamalon main mritak kii shinaakht hi media kii vajah se ho paati he
 Murder without identification cannot be solved
 tippaniyan The question is also arising that if there is a ban, then why not till the blame is proved? Why only till the charge sheet is filed? Even after that, many accused are released
 to kya tab uske saath anyaay nahin hoga? baharhaal, roak media ko kuch khaas jaankaree dene par lagi he
 Not to be published in the media, so it will not be called a ban on the media, but it is definitely an attempt to stop the media from giving information to a large extent
 yah bhi sach he ki aaropee or peedit ke adhikaar kaa khyaal rakhana chahie, lekin saath main ye dekhnaa bhi jaruri he ki jaanch main paardarshita bani rahe varna rasukhdaar log police se milakar maamle ko rafadpha karne se baj nahi aaenge
 After all, there are many such cases, which have been reached due to the media
 isliye media jaisaa paharedaar bhi jaruri he
 The state government's affidavit contains 15 guidelines, which prohibit information on the victim and his family along with the accused

 1993 main hue mumbai serial bam dhamaakon kaa hawala dete hue jatin desai poochhate hai ki us maamle main to ab bhi kai aaropee faraar hai to kya ham uski reporting hi na karen? According to Desai, it would have been good if the government had known the media's side before such a ban
 artiai kaaryakarta anil galgali ne to ise media kaa galaa ghontne kii koshish qaraar diya he
 Galgali says exposing the accused creates fear in them and stops the crime and the media only reports when the police register a case or arrest someone
 galgali kaa sawaal he police galat aadmi ko giraftaar hi kyon karti he? Whereas former IPS Sudhakar Suradkar says that when we talk of rights, duty also has to be understood
 rashtriya suraksha se jude maamalon me is tarahan kii pabandi jaruri he, lekin sabhi maamalon main nahin
 The special thing is that not only the media but also many policemen do not consider this circular to be completely correct
 unka kahana he ki hatya ke kai maamalon main mritak kii shinaakht hi media kii vajah se ho paati he
 Murder without identification cannot be solved
 tippaniyan The question is also arising that if there is a ban, then why not till the blame is proved? Why only till the charge sheet is filed? Even after that, many accused are released
 to kya tab uske saath anyaay nahin hoga? baharhaal, roak media ko kuch khaas jaankaree dene par lagi he
 Not to be published in the media, so it will not be called a ban on the media, but it is definitely an attempt to stop the media from giving information to a large extent
 yah bhi sach he ki aaropee or peedit ke adhikaar kaa khyaal rakhana chahie, lekin saath main ye dekhnaa bhi jaruri he ki jaanch main paardarshita bani rahe varna rasukhdaar log police se milakar maamle ko rafadpha karne se baj nahi aaenge
 After all, there are many such cases, which have been reached due to the media

 RTI activist Anil Galgali has called it an attempt to strangle the media
 galgali kaa kahana he aropiyon ko benakaab karne se unamem bhay paidaa hota he or aparaadh par roak lagati he or media tabhi khabar chalaati he jab police maamla darj karti yaa phir kisi ko giraftaar karti he
 Galgali's question is why does the police arrest the wrong man? jabaki purv ipies sudhakar suradkar kaa kahana he ki jab ham haq kii baat karte hai to ferj bhi samajhnaa hoga

 But the wife knew that the husband was present with a woman inside the house
 patni ne sidhe colbel bajaayaa, lekin andar se jab koi jawaab nahin aayaa to usne police ko bula liya
 What was then, the police peeked inside the house from the back door of the flat
 cheekh chillaakar us mahila ke pati se main door kii chaabi maangi
 As soon as the door opened, that was what was expected
 gusse main laal pili ho rahi shikayatakarta ne us colgirl or apane pati ke saath jamkar hathapayee kii
 The police, who were engaged in beach rescue, captured the callgirl and the victim's husband

 100 meter kii daud kaa naam aate hi beijing olympics kii ve tasviren zahan main aane lagati hai, jahaan jamaica ke yusen bolt ne itihaas rachaa tha or sab hairaan rah gaye the
 
 
 But now, apart from Bolt, there are many faces in London Olympics who can outplay, and achieve the status of being the fastest humans on earth
 
 
 haalanki ab bhi is res ko jeetne ke sabase bade daavedaar yusen bolt hi hai, or unheen ke naam is event main world record bhi darj he
 
 
 He took this time at the 2009 World Athletics Championships in Berlin, Germany
 
 
 vaise iske alaava pichley olympics, yani varsh 2008 main china ke beijing shahar main hue khelon main 100 meter, 200 meter, or 400x100 meter riley main unhone hi swarna padak jeeta tha

 The comments inke baad zikr karnaa hoga, america ke pratibhashali dhaavak justin gatelin kaa, jinhone varsh 2004 main hue athens olympics main gold jeeta tha, or tab se yah dhaavak vakt-vakt par apane hone kaa ehsaas karwaata rahaa he

 bolt ke baad jamaica ke hi yohan blake is daud ko jeetne ke duusare sabase bade daavedaar hai
 
 
 Yohan Blake is the defending World Champion, and his best time of 9
 75 second kaa he
 
 
 In 2011, Blake won the World Championship, and in the same year he has also beaten Usain Bolt in the 100 and 200 meter races
 
 
 tisare daavedaar hai, tyson ge
 
 
 After Bolt, Tyson Gay has done the best time in 100 meters race
 
 
 tyson kaa sarvshereshth samay 9
 69 seconds
 
 
 haalanki ge 29 saal ke hai, magar landan olympics ke liye unhone jabardast training kii he
 
 
 Anyway, Tyson Gay is one of the three athletes who beat Bolt
 
 
 tippaniyan To be mentioned after this is the talented American runner Justin Gatlin, who won the Gold in the Athens Olympics in 2004, and since then this runner has been making sense of himself from time to time
 
 
 haalanki drug test main positive paae jane par un par chaar saal kaa bain bhi laga, magar 'fiter' gatelin ne varsh 2010 main vaapasi kii or kai event jite
 
 
 Another name is Bolt's own compatriot Asafa Powell, and his claim is none the less
 
 
 duniya main sabase zyada baar 100 meter kii res 10 second se kam main khatm karne kaa record powell ke hi naam he
 
 
 He has also beaten Bolt
 
 
 varsh 2005 se lekar 2008 tak powell hi 100 meter daud ke shahenshaah bhi rahe hai
 
 
 The third contender is Tyson Gay
 
 
 bolt ke baad 100 meter kii res main sabase badhiya samay nikaalane kaa karnama tyson ge ne hi kiya he
 
 
 Tyson's Best Time 9
 69 second he
