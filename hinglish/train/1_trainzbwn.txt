pradesh congress ke soshal media department ne ahmedabad main ‘war room’ samet teen centre bana rakhe hai
 Teams of more than 150 people are busy day and night
 ye team kareeb 2000 walentrs ke jariye party ke sandeshon kososhal mediake jariye logon tak pahunchane kaa kaam kar rahi hai
 Rohan Gupta, the head of the Congress's Social Media Department for Gujarat, told Aaj Tak that the war room is working on a social media campaign day and night through volunteers
 hamaare teen alag-alag centre ahmedabad main hai, jahaan par content banataa he
 Then, attention is given to how to reach it to the people
 congress kii gujarat soshal media team ne haal main ‘main hum pakkaa gujarati’campagne shuru kiya he
 Earlier, 'vikas Gando Thayo Che' and 'thank you Mota Saheb' have also been made the basis of the campaign
 rohan gupta kehete hai ki logon kaa dhyaan khinchne ke liye unki team ‘kuch hat kar’ campagne taiyaar karne kii ranneeti par kaam kar rahi he
 Rohan Gupta makes his point clear that what the BJP says, which it markets, there is a difference of ground in reality
 vahiin hamaara puraa kaa puraa campan hakeekat dikhaane main he
 Are we not Gujaratis when it comes to Gujarati identity? Did BJP not remember Gujarati while taking decisions like demonetisation, GST? We are exposing bjp's claims through our campaign, that is why they are getting it wrong
 ham un par koi iljaam nahin laga rahe, sirf hakeekat dikhaa rahe hai

 By placing high standards for membership, the CPC is not only hoping to attract the best and brightest youth, but is also trying to build the party's image as a group of talented people
 kariyar ke liye maukey uplabdh karana nishchit rup se ek badhibia upaay he
 But is this enough to maintain faith in the party's mission? Xi Jinping, the son of a revolutionary and former leader of the party and the new general secretary, may not think so

 Surprisingly, Xi's message is ideologically absolute
 unka mukhya naaraa america-prerit ''chini sapana'' he, jisamen ''chini raashtra ke mahaan punarjagran'' kaa aahvaan he
 Among the many challenges Xi faces today, one of the biggest challenges is that some people in China, especially in cities, are beginning to seek their role in operating the country
 pichley do saal main china ke shahari log pehali baar apni maangon ko lekar sadakon par utarane lage hai

 lekin kuch had tak ek vajah yah bhi he ki party asantosh bardaasht nahin karti he
 Yet the demand for political reforms has increased among intellectuals
 beijing ke itihaaskaar or ek prabhaavshaalee purv netaa ke putr jhang lifan kehete hai ki party main bahut se log loktantr nahin balki shi kii tarah taqatvar bananaa chaahate hai
 They believe that economic growth will continue to justify the party even further
 ve kehete hai, ''yah sachmuch ek virodhabhas he kyonki arthvyavastha ke udaarikaran se saamaajik or rajnatik maang uthegi
 Reforms cannot be avoided
 ''shi ke liye soviet sangh ke patan se sabase bada sabak tha ki samyawad main gorbachev kii ''kamjor'' aasthaa thi, jaisaa ek aantarik baithak main unhone bataaya tha
 Instead of considering democratization, Xi is trying to restore confidence in the party through sustained economic growth, nationalism and anti-corruption campaigns
 abhi yah kahana jaldbaaji hogi ki ve isamen safal hote hai yaa nahin
 It is certain that he has got the support of such solid communists like Li Hongta, who were disenchanted with the current party

 pakistan main hinduon par hamale kii ghatnaayen aam baat hai, lekin is baar intehaa ho rahi he
 a video is going viral on social media in which it is said that the police of Pakistan is beating and beating Hindu families
 is video ko ye likhakar share kiya ja rahaa he ki "dekhen pakistan main hinduon ke saath kya hota he
 After watching this video, your eyes will get filled, if possible, wake up some more people
 "video main saaf taur par dekha ja saktaa he ki bahut saare police ke jawan jinhone kaale rang kii vardi pahani hui he, usapar english main likhaa hua he
 
 
 
 
 "no Fear"
 ve gharon main jabaran ghuskar logon par danda or laat-ghunse barasaa rahe hai
 The women of the house are seen screaming
 pulisavaale ek aadmi ko ghar se khinchakar baahar nikaal rahe hai
 Everyone is put in line and put in a cart
 is viral video ko ek hafte main sabase zyaada bijepi mishan 2019 naam ke fasebuk pej par sabase zyaada yani ab tak 15 lakh se zyaada log dekh chuke hai
 Over 45 thousand people have shared it
 iske alaava kai logon ne bhi ise fasebuk pej par daalaa he
 We were also surprised when we saw the video
 kya vaaki pakistan main hinduon ko peeta ja rahaa he, kya pakistan main hinduon ke saath julm kii ati ho rahi he ?, pakistan main hinduon ko laat-ghunson se maaraa ja rahaa he
 Why are women screaming, why are men being chased? Why Pakistan's police became enemies of Hindus? We fact-checked it
 ye video pakistan kaa bataaya ja rahaa he
 So we first reverse-searched the video on the Internet
 hamen pataa chalaa ki ye video sabase pehle 5 aktubar, 2014 ko you-tub par bilal afagaan naam ke ek shaks ne post kiya tha
 While uploading the video, Bilal wrote that the Pakistani police had beaten the citizens there, he did not mention any religion in his post
 sirf yahi nahin hamen ye video "pis worldwide" naamak ek or you-tub pej par mila
 Which was posted on 25 May 2015
 lekin is video par jo capshan tha wo chaunkaane vaala tha
 It was written that the police who persecuted Christians - i want everyone to see this video, showing how badly Christians are being treated by the Pakistani government
 yahaan pakistani police isaayiyon ke gharon par chaape maar rahi he or giraftaar kar rahi he or pitayee kar rahi he
 In such a situation, we got confused whether this video is about beating of Hindus, or beating of Christians
 ab hamaari padtaal or mushkil ho gai
 For this we turned directly to Pakistan
 islamabad main ajtak ke reporter hamaza aamir ne bataaya ki ye video pakistan ke faisalabad shahar kaa he
 And this video is not about the beating of any minority Hindus, but this video is of 11 June 2013 when people were protesting on the streets in the Khurriyamwala Town area of faisalabad on the power cuts
 logon ne gadiyon or petrol pump tak phoonk daale, jiske jawaab main pakistan ke punjab praant kii police ne karrwai kii
 And killed people by sneaking into homes
 yahaan tak ki mahilaon ko bhi nahin bakhsha
 Pakistan news channels at that time also showed this news loudly
 jiske chalate pakistan ke 5 pulicekarmi bhi suspend kar diye gaye the
 This video has been shared many times before with the same claim that atrocities with Hindus are happening in Pakistan and sometimes over Christians
 padtaal se saaf ho gaya he kii yah video pakistan ke faisalabad main bijli kii samasya ko lekar ho rahe pradarshan ke dauraan
 The video is dated 11 June 2013
 pradarshan ke dauraan vahaan par bheed hinsak ho gai thi
 In response to this, the Punjab Police had beaten the father to the local people, but this video has nothing to do with any caste or religion
 fact check main yah video fail sabit hui
 Singer-musician Adnan Sami has again castigated Pakistanis

 Among the people whom Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar got with him in the election battleground against BJP, Arvind Kejriwal has a prominent name beyond the count of votes and seats
 nitish jab bhi dilli aate hai kejariwal se mulaakaat karte hai, vahiin rashtriya rajdhani main keservil kaa karishma dekh chuke nitish kii chunavi ranneeti bahut had tak kejariwal jaisi hi he
 It is interesting that while Nitish Kumar first gave the slogan of 'fight against communalism', the DNA of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has become electoral minister and social media is a big weapon for the bjp's chariot
 rajya main jaise-jaise chunaav ke din najadik aa rahe hai, nitish kumaar twitor par sakriy ho rahe hai
 JDU-RJD has started such an exercise among people in social media to assembly constituencies, which is in some way compatible with 'kejriwal style'

 Not only this, voters were also connected through whatsapp during this period

 The Aam Aadmi Party worked on the policy of bringing the leader and the public closer to the leader and gave a new stream to politics
 bihar main nitish kumaar bhi ab is dhara ko apane anusaar modane main jute hue hai
 After 'har Ghar Dastak', 'ask Nitish Campaign' was also a very popular idea in which people can directly question their Chief Minister
 soshal media ko tawvajonithish sarkaar ne beete kuch maheenon main soshal media ko bhi khub tawvajo di he
 While Nitishkhud has been active on Twitter, other party leaders and activists are also connecting with the public through Facebook
 geet-sangeet or ringtonnithish kumaar ne 'har ghar dastak' ke saath chunaav prachaar ke liye ek geet bhi banwaaya he
 Not only this, he is also making it ringtone and reaching it to the people
 dilli main aam aadmi party ne bhi chunavi jameen taiyaar karne ke liye kuch aisi hi vidhiyon kaa istemaal kiya tha
 First, he left the chair, then asked for forgiveness, it is a coincidence that the way Arvind Kejriwal had apologized to the public for his return after 49 days of government in Delhi, it was Nitish Kumar in the same manner that Nitish Kumar also took the post of the first Chief Minister
 Resigned from the office and then returned to the post apologizing to the public

 This is a serious film which was to have a slow start and we were ready for it
 magar ye zarur he ki film ko kaafii pasand kiya ja rahaa he or box offis par lambey samay tak jaaegi

 is film se bhi waisi hi ummid he kyonki tex free hone kaa kuch na kuch to faaydaa hoga 'drishyam' ko

 Even after 7 decades of independence, no educational institute of India, ie University, is included in the 200 leading universities of the world
 yah aankada desh kii ucch shiksha kii gunvattta ko prakat karata he
 However, there is a shortage of institutions of higher education in this country

 He has discussed these in his convocation address
 vaise ye spasht he ki hamaare vidhyaarthiyon main yogyata kii kami nahin he
 The same students go out many times and wave their glory and get their qualifications ironed
 ukt chintaa apni jagah he lekin vartmaan sthiti or bhi gambhir he
 Many universities have not been able to maintain their old standards
 bharat ke kai bade vishvavidhyalayon ke str main giravat ai he
 The policy of the then UPA government was very bizarre
 is sarkaar ne vishvavidhyalayon yaa anya ucch shiksha santhaan kaa str sudhaarney ke liye koi prayaas na karte hue kai nae kendriya vishvavidhyalay sthapit kar die
 The new government has not done anything yet, so commenting on it here is not very appropriate
 lekin yah jarur prathit hota he ki yah bhi puraani sarkaar ke tarj par chalegi kyonki iske dhoshna patr main prayek rajya main ek iaiti, ek ai ai em or ek kendriya vishvavidhyalay kholane kii baat kahi gai he
 However, no government will pay special attention to opening new institutions because it is easier to take political advantage
 nae santhaan khule he, bhale hi vah asthai jagah par chal rahe ho or asthai karmchaaree ho, sabhi ko dikhaai detaa he jabaki vishvavidhyalay ke str main sudhaar ke liye prayaas kaa prabhaav bahut jald nahin prathit hota or ek bada varg jisko nimna str se laabh ho rahaa tha naaraaz ho jaataa hai
 Thus it is not easy to take political advantage from it
 vaise nae santhaan kholane kii niti ke khilaaf bhi koi nahin he
 But there is a need for new institutions in this country, but along with this policy, attention needs to be paid to the old institutions as well
 niyukti main paardarshita or shodh tathaa shikshan ke str ko sudhaar kar sansthaanon ke str ko badhaayaa ja saktaa he
 There is a lack of transparency in university level appointments

 Words like brother nepotism, guru disciple tradition, casteism etc
 are very prevalent at university level

 The problem does not end here on the first appointment, after becoming an assistant professor, the promotion to the posts of Associate Professor and Professor persists
 hameshaa chuuhe billi jaisi daud bani rahati he
 All these problems can be controlled to some extent if changes are made in the appointment process
 sangh lok seva ayog jaisaa ek ayog acha vikalp ho saktaa he
 It is necessary to note here that this commission should be impartial and do nothing under the pressure of the government
 jaisaa ujisi kaa ek udhaaharan saamne aayaa he
 In the UPA government, the same UGC did not put any pressure on the University of Delhi and today the UGC changed as the Central Government changed and forced the University of Delhi to remove the four-year course
 shodh main sudhaar laane ke liye sabase pehle piechdi str ke shodh main sudhaar laane kaa prayaas karnaa padegaa
 Write anything and submit a phd
 The supervisor sends the thesis to his familiar teachers and gets it passed
 It is necessary to try to break this tradition, however, with some good appointment, this problem will be regular because the qualified person can do something good or right
 It can be assumed that we will try, but relying only on this belief will not improve, we need a strict rule
 sarkaar ko acchhee shodh ke liye shodh raashi badhaanen ke saath saath vishvavidhyalayon ko aavashyak moolbhoot suvidhaon se susajjit karnaa hoga in sabhi prayaason se ham hamaare shaikshik sansthaanon ke girte str ko bachaa sakate hai

 He is also an MLA from Naranpura in Ahmedabad
 aaj jab ve vidhansabha pahunche to get par hi unke swaagat ke liye kai mantri, vidhayak or kaaryakarta maujuud the
 The assembly session ends on Friday, so Shah arrived to attend as an MLA
 vidhansabha bahes main hissaa lete hue unhone congress par hamalaa bolaa
 After the meeting, he met Congress leader Shankarsinh Vaghela to discuss tea
 is mulaakaat se atakalon kaa daur shuru hua he
 However, Shankarsinh said that the meeting was offered by Shah, so they met as an old ally
 tippaniyan It is noteworthy that Amit Shah arrived in Gujarat to celebrate the victory in Uttar Pradesh to encourage the enthusiasm of BJP workers in Gujarat
 yahaan party ne unka joardaar swaagat kiya
 On this occasion, about one lakh workers gathered from all over the state
 lekin jab gujarat main bhaajapa main bhi is chunavi jeet kaa phayda uthaane ke liye jald chunaav kii sugabugahat tej he tab amit shah ne ise khaarij karte hue navambar main hi chunaav kii sambhaavna vyakt kii
 He said that "friends, Vijay Rath of Bharatiya Janata Party under the leadership of Narendra Bhai is going to visit Gujarat in November
" main aapse poochna chahta hum ki jab bhaajapa kaa rath gujarat aa rahaa he to kya bhaajapa kaaryakarta taiyaar hai
 Let me tell Modi sir
 '' Amit Shah hoped to win more seats in the Gujarat elections than before
 amit shah ke liye yah raily mahatvapurn thi kyonki rajya main ab bhi patidaar aarakshan andolan, thakor samaaj kaa andolan or dalit bhi sarkaar ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaa rahe hai
 In such a situation, it seems necessary to show confidence of victory among the workers
 amit shah ne kaha ki ganga ke kinare kanpur ke ek sammelan main kaaryakartaaon ne nirnay kiya tha ki is baar 300 se zyada siton vaali sarkaar banani he
 Similarly, on the banks of the great Sabarmati river, where the foundation of the freedom struggle was laid, today the Bharatiya Janata Party workers have gathered to take a pledge that this time Gujarat has to bring more than 150 seats
 uttar pradesh ke baad amit shah mishan gujarat main jute gaye hai
 On Thursday, he will appear as an MLA in the Assembly and will also take stock of the party's election preparations
 ullekhneey he ki uttar pradesh main jeet kaa jashn manaakar gujarat main bijepi kaaryakartaaon kaa utsaah badhaane ke liye amit shah kaa gujarat aagaman hua
 Here the party welcomed him strongly
 is maukey par puure rajya ke kareeb ek lakh kaaryakarta jute
 But when the rush of elections is fast to take advantage of this electoral victory in the BJP in Gujarat too, Amit Shah rejected the possibility of election in November itself
 unhone kaha ki ''mitro narendra bhai ke netritv main chal rahaa bhartiya janata party kaa vijay rath ghoomte-ghoomte navambar main gujarat aane vaala he
 i want to ask you whether BJP workers are ready when the bjp's chariot is coming to Gujarat
 modi sahab se kah duun
 '' amit shah ne gujarat chunaav main pehle se zyada siton par jeet kii ummid jataai
 This rally was important for Amit Shah as the Patidar reservation movement, Thakor Samaj movement and Dalits are also raising their voice against the government
 aise main kaaryakartaaon main jeet kaa bharosa jataana jaruri lag rahaa he
 Amit Shah said that at a conference in Kanpur on the banks of the Ganges, the workers had decided that this time a government with more than 300 seats was to be formed
 isi tarah us mahaan sabarmati nadi ke kinare, jahaan par swatantraaa sangram kii neenv rakhi gai, aaj bhartiya janata party ke kaaryakarta yah sankalp lene ke liye ikatthe hue hai ki is baar gujarat main 150 se zyada siten laana he
 After Uttar Pradesh, Amit Shah Mission has converged in Gujarat
 guuruuvaar ko ve vidhayak ke taur par vidhansabha main hajiri denge or party kii chunavi taiyaariyon kaa jayja bhi lenge
 Amit Shah hoped to win more seats in the Gujarat elections than before
 amit shah ke liye yah raily mahatvapurn thi kyonki rajya main ab bhi patidaar aarakshan andolan, thakor samaaj kaa andolan or dalit bhi sarkaar ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaa rahe hai
 In such a situation, it seems necessary to show confidence of victory among the workers

 Stars of srk's Diwali party, Kareena's look Viral Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan organized a birthday and Diwali party together at his bungalow Mannat in Bandra on the evening of 3rd
 is party main tamaam diggaj sitare shariq hue
 Sparkled by film stars, the party was attended by various film stars including Kareena Kapoor Khan, Alia Bhatt, Katrina Kaif, Aamir Khan, Jackie Shroff and Sanjay Leela Bhansali
 3 november ko bollywood ke king khan 53 saal ke ho gaye
 So let's see how the stars arrived at their Grand Birthday Come Diwali party
 uttar pradesh kii raajnneeti kaa tilism tut gaya he
 One can think of UP as UP; no one can defeat its regional leaders
 
 
 upi kii raajnneeti ne is dharna ko majboot kiya ki rashtriya raajnneeti main gathbandhan kii raajnneeti hi chalegi
 It was demolished by Amit Shah under the leadership of Prime Minister Modi in 2014 and again in 2017 after three years
 'upi ko gujarat pasand he', pataa nahin kisi ne ye naaraa kyon nahin likhaa, lekin upi ne apni taraf se yahi naaraa de diya he
 Those who understand Indian politics have become confused by understanding UP
 philhal yahi lagata he ki upi ko amit shah se behatar koi nahin jaanata or upi pradhanmantri modi se behatar kisi ko nahin pahachaanata he
 Before Congress and Modi, UP, trapped in BJP, BSP and SP, could not find a way to make way for itself
 kai saal lag gaye
 Modi and Amit Shah sidelined these parties twice within three years
 congress gathbandhan karne ke baad bhi 28 siton se ghatakar 6 par aa gai
 bjp's ally Apna Dal came out above the Congress with 9 seats
 11 siton par ladakar 9 siten jeetne kaa strike rate congress se bhi behatar he
 Rashtriya Lok Dal, which has scared BJP in the name of Jat vote, has got the same seat of Chhaprauli
 bijepi ne 2014 main 300 se adhik siton par badhat hasil kii, teen saal baad 324 siton par jeet mili
 In 62 seats, BJP candidates won by more than 50,000 votes
 yah janadesh sirf upi kaa nahin he balki pradhanmantri modi ke kaamkaaj ke liye bhi he
 The public has sent him a thank you note before 2019
 upi kii is jeet kii kahin koi samanta nahin milti he
 In one case it can be compared to Bihar
 nitish kumaar ne vahaan ati pichhadaa or mahadalit kii raajnneeti kii khoj kii or ghanghor tareeke se use gadha
 The same pattern is seen with BJP in UP
 bijepi kii is jeet se ek laabh us tabake ko milegaa yaa milanaa chahie jo yadavon or jatvon ke varchasv kii raajnneeti ke kaaran nahin mil sakaa tha
 non-yadav backward and very backward classes will also get a share of power
 unke bheetar se bhi satta kaa labhaarthi varg paidaa hoga
 As long as this hunger persists, BJP will remain permanently in UP
 jaise hi varchasv ke rup main ati pichhadaa kaayam hoga raajnneeti ise chunauti degi
 Then a new equation will form, a new leader will emerge
 philhal yah sameekaran or netritv kii chamak bijepi ke paas aayaa he
 BJP leaders also repeatedly said that the Brahmin, Baniya's party has now become a party of the poor and extremely backward
 iske baad bhi bijepi ko itani badi kamyaabi nahin milti agar use sabhi virgon se utsahjanak samarthan nahin miltaa
 BJP has won for itself but presents a challenge to losers to understand politics
 haar-jeet hoti rahati he, lekin ye wo jeet he, jiske saamne haarane vaala bifer gaya he
 Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati talked that they were able to see the defeat, but could not understand the reason for the defeat
 kabhi apane vikaas se unka yakeen uth rahaa he to kabhi iviem mashin se
 No party had got such a majority since 1980
 yah jeet itani badi he ki uttarakhand main hi bijepi kii apni badi jeet par baari he
 In Manipur and Goa, the BJP can also try to form a government
 uma bharti ne enditivi india se baat karte hue kaha ki pradhanmantri ek nai aarthik samskruti viksit kar rahe hai, jahaan amir or garib kaa jhagada nahin he, magar garib kaa cheharaa sabase aage he
 They are preparing a people who are not dependent on the government, but can stand on their own feet
 amit shah ne kaha he ki bijepi kii vichaardhaara or pradhanmantri kii vikaas kii nitiyon kii jeet he
 Amit Shah said that after the first two-phase election, he had said that BJP would win 90 seats out of 125, but more than that 115 seats were won
 ye wo daur tha jab jat matadaataaon ke kaaran bijepi ko chunauti milti dikh rahi thi
 The comments amit shah ne ye bhi kaha he ki upi kii sarkaar kii pehali baithak main kisaanon kaa karza maaf kiya jayega
 Congress raised the issue but BJP is going to show it
 ho saktaa he upi ke baad duusare rajyon ke kisaanon ko bhi is faisle kaa laabh mili
 The BSP has reached 19 seats
 1989 main jab party ne pehla chunaav ladaa tha, tab use 13 siten ai thim
 The BSP that had the distinction of defeating the BJP during the Ram Janmabhoomi era, the BSP used to say 'got Mulayam Kanshi Ram, Jai Shri Ram flew into the air'
 27 saal baad bijepi ne mulaayam or kanshiram kii banaai party ko hawa main uda diya he
 Justice of politics is also justice of nature
 basapa ke paas paanch saal sochane ke liye vakt mila magar usne jo bhi kiya, nahin chalaa
 Amit Shah had little time to understand UP, winning twice between 2013 and 2017
 har jati varg main bijepi ko jabardast samarthan mila he
 BJP has got 84 percent seats in the Scheduled Caste dominated assemblies
 obisi bahul vidhansabhaon main 78 pratishat siton par bijepi jiti he
 The BJP has won 90% of Jat dominated seats
 yadav bahul 65 fisadi siton par bijepi ne jeet hasil kii he
 BJP has won 82 percent of the seats in urban areas
 gramin kshetron kii 80 fisadi siton par bijepi ne jeet hasil kii he
 In a way, the Modi wave of 2017 is bigger than the Modi wave of 2014
 2014 main bijepi ko 337 siton par badhat thi
 The sp-congress alliance should have won 310 seats, but BJP won 324 seats
 2014 kii tulana main 14 seat zyaada
 If the UP is not seen from a new scale, then it would be unfair to deal with this great mandate
 anusuchit jati ke matadaataaon me se 41 fisadi ne bijepi ko pasand kiya he
 The BSP is favored only by 25 percent of scheduled caste voters
 jat matadaataaon main se 45 fisadi bijepi ko, 21 fisadi basapa ko or 22 fisadi bhaajapa ko diya he
 Out of the Yadav voters, 38% got BJP, 32% got SP Congress and 22% got BSP
 general matadaataaon main se 44 fisadi bijepi ko, 24 fisadi sapa congress ko or 21 fisadi bispi ko
 This data shows that the siege of caste has broken in UP politics
 na cast he, na kor cast he, na misalenius cast he
 The BJP gained more than 300 seats in 2014, winning 324 seats three years later
 62 siton par bijepi ke ummidavaar 50,000 se zyaada vot se jite hai
 This mandate is not only for UP but also for the work of Prime Minister Modi
 2019 se pehle janata ne unhen thankyuu note bhej diya he
 There is no resemblance to this victory of UP
 ek maamle main isaki bihar se tulana kii ja sakati he
 Nitish Kumar discovered the politics of the backward and Mahadalit there and coined it in a terrible way
 yahi ek pattern upi main bijepi ke saath dikh rahaa he
 This victory of the BJP will give an advantage to that section which could not be got due to the politics of domination of Yadavs and Jatavs
 gair yadav pichhadaa or ati pichhadaa varg ko bhi satta main hissedari milegi
 a beneficiary class of power will also be born from within them
 jab tak yah bhukh bani rahegi, bijepi upi main sthaayee rup se rahegi
 Politics will challenge it as soon as supremacy prevails
 phir koi nayaa sameekaran banegaa, koi nayaa netaa saamne aayega
 At present, this equation and leadership shine has come to BJP
 bijepi ke netaaon ne bhi baar-baar kaha ki brahman, baniyaa kii party ab garib or ati pichhadon kii party ban gai he

 They are preparing a people who are not dependent on the government, but can stand on their own feet
 amit shah ne kaha he ki bijepi kii vichaardhaara or pradhanmantri kii vikaas kii nitiyon kii jeet he
 Amit Shah said that after the first two-phase election, he had said that BJP would win 90 seats out of 125, but more than that 115 seats were won
 ye wo daur tha jab jat matadaataaon ke kaaran bijepi ko chunauti milti dikh rahi thi
 The comments amit shah ne ye bhi kaha he ki upi kii sarkaar kii pehali baithak main kisaanon kaa karza maaf kiya jayega
 Congress raised the issue but BJP is going to show it
 ho saktaa he upi ke baad duusare rajyon ke kisaanon ko bhi is faisle kaa laabh mili
 The BSP has reached 19 seats
 1989 main jab party ne pehla chunaav ladaa tha, tab use 13 siten ai thim

 In a way, the Modi wave of 2017 is bigger than the Modi wave of 2014
 2014 main bijepi ko 337 siton par badhat thi
 The sp-congress alliance should have won 310 seats, but BJP won 324 seats
 2014 kii tulana main 14 seat zyaada
 If the UP is not seen from a new scale, then it would be unfair to deal with this great mandate

 The BSP is favored only by 25 percent of scheduled caste voters

 general matadaataaon main se 44 fisadi bijepi ko, 24 fisadi sapa congress ko or 21 fisadi bispi ko
 This data shows that the siege of caste has broken in UP politics

 bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne khud kaha he ki unka asli lakshya pashchim bengal main 22+ siten jeetne kaa he
 But now the TMC has responded to this target of Shah

 Mamta also addressed this rally

 He said that what did these people win in Junglemahal, they started the politics of violence
 bengal kii siem ne kaha ki jo gunde pehle sipiem ke liye dhamkee dene kaa kaam karte the, ab ve bijepi kii sharan main hai
 He alleged that BSF had entered the voting line during the panchayat elections
 tiemasi pramukh ne kaha ki uttar pradesh main encounter ke naam par logon ko maaraa ja rahaa he
 He said that forget about the Emergency of Indira Gandhi, in today's time people do not have the right to choose their religion

 In fact, referring to the controversy in Lalu Prasad Yadav's family, Sanjay Singh had said that Misa Bharti's role in Lalu Prasad Yadav's family is like that of Shurpanakha
 jis tarah shurpanakha apane bhai ravan or bibhishana ke bich jhagada karwaati thi, vaise hi misa bharti tejpratap yadav or tejasvi ke bich jhagada karvaa rahi hai
 Let me tell you that for quite some time there have been reports of estrangement between Lalu Prasad Yadav's son Tej Pratap Yadav and Tejashwi Yadav

 When does Kemdrum Yoga dissolve? - When there are auspicious planets in the eighth or sixth house from the moon
 - jab kundali main shubh grah majboot hon
 - When there are only auspicious planets in the center
 - jab brihaspati centre main ho
 - When night is born in Shukla Paksha or day in Krishna Paksha
 kemdrum yoga se bachane ke upaay kya he?- nity praatah mata ke charan sparsh karen

 Most people in India consider Hindi as the national language
 desh kii sarvaadhik jansankhya hindi samajhati he or adhikansh hindi bol lete hai
 But it is also true that Hindi is not the national language of this country

 According to Urvashi, it is unfortunate that even after seven months, the Government of India, which has spoken big things in the name of Hindi, has not been able to give information about the promotion of Hindi in the country
 varsh 1947 se vittiya varsh 2012-13 tak videshon main hindi ke prachaar-prasar kii jaankaree dene ke liye urvashi sharma kii soochna kii arji pradhanmantri karyaalay se grih mantralay ke rajbhasha vibhaag, rajbhasha vibhaag se videsh mantralay or videsh mantralay se vitt mantralay ko transfar kii ja rahi he
 According to a letter written by Director of the Ministry of External Affairs, Manish Prabhat on 21 February, the Government of India is not aware of the promotion of Hindi abroad from the year 1947 to the financial year 1983-84
 urvashi kaa kahana he ki yah dukhad he ki hindi ke naam par vaktavy dekar apane kartavyon kii itishree maanane vaali bharat sarkaar ke paas videshon main hindi ke prachaar-prasar kii 36 varsho kii koi jaankaree hi nahin he

 Samajwadi Party Rajya Sabha MP Munavvar Salim has sharply attacked Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi in the case of two Muslim youths arrested from Mewat district of Haryana in a conspiracy to carry out a terrorist incident in Muzaffarnagar
 saleem ne kaha ki rahul gandhi ne jis din indore kii raily main kaha tha ki mujffarnagar ke yuvak aatankwaadiyon ke sampark main hai, tabhi is baat kaa andeshaa ho gaya tha ki yuvaraj ko sahi sabit karne ke liye hindustan kaa khufia tantra koi kasar nahin chhodega
 He said that Rahul Gandhi should also be interrogated along with the arrested youth if this investigation is true
 unhone maang kii ki jab tak khufia agenciyaan rahul se poochtacha nahin karatin tab tak desh kii suraksha agenciyon kii karypranali par sawaal bana rahegaa
 He said that it would be said that until Rahul was questioned, poor Muslims got trapped and Rahul Gandhi survived
 congress ke kai netaa sieji kii bhoomika kii aalochana karte rahe hai
 Now that the CAG has attacked, there has been a sharp response from the Congress
 digvajiy singh ne poocha he ki kya sieji piem bananaa chaahate hai
 Targeting the CAG, Information and Broadcasting Minister Manish Tiwari said that the constitutional authorities should remain within the purview of Laxman Rekha
 tiwari ne kaha, ‘‘yah sarvaadhik durbhagyapurna he ki kaig ne apni sankhya (2-ji ghotaale main 1
 Instead of justifying the correctness of the estimated loss of Rs 76 lakh crore), criticized the government on foreign land and foreign platform
 ’’ He was replying to questions asked by CAG Vinod Rai on the statement made yesterday at Harvard's Kennedy School
 tiwari ne kaha, ‘‘sawaal sankhya kii shuddhta ke bare main he
 Our question to the Comptroller and Auditor General is that where 1
 76 lakh karod rupee kaa nuksaan he

 ’’ He said that this is not the first time he (CAG) has done so (criticizing the government)
 unhone kaha, ‘‘yah pehla mauka nahin he jab unhone aisa kiya he
 i believe constitutional authorities should follow the Lakshman Rekha
 ’’ CPM MP Sitaram Yechury has supported the CAG
 unhonen kaha ki sieji kaa kaam sirf acounts kaa audit hi nahin policy kaa audit bhi karnaa he
 At the same time, the Trinamool Congress called these allegations serious and said that the government should respond to this
 isse pehle guuruuvaar ko pehle 2-ji or phir koyala aavanton ghotaale ke maamle main ai sieji report ko lekar khud par ho rahe hamalon kaa sieji vinod raay ne karaara jawaab diya he
 Speaking at a foreign university, CAG Vinod Rai pulled up the government and said that those who believe that their role is only that of an accountant are wrong
 tippaniyan Vinod Rai asked whether Parliament and the public consider us only accountants for government expenditure? Our role in the Constitution requires more than just being an accountant
 raay ne kaha ki ham sarkari kaamkaaj ko behatar banane ke liye prabandhan kii kisi bhi duusari sanstha jitna hi kaam karte he
 The CAG will continue to expose the nexus between bureaucrats, politicians and capitalists
 unka kahana tha ki sarkaar udyogon ke liye nitiyaan banaaen naa ki puunjipatiyon ke liye

 There is a loss of Rs 76 lakh crore
 vah sawaal ab bhi barkaraar he
 '' unhone kaha ki yah pehla mauka nahin he jab unhone (kaig ne) aisa (sarkaar kii aalochana) kiya he
 "this is not the first time he has done this," he said
 meraa maananaa he ki sanvaidhanik praadhikaron ko lakshmana rekha kaa paalan karnaa chahie
 '' sipiem ke saansad seetaram yechuri ne sieji kaa samarthan kiya he
 He said that cag's job is not only to audit the accounts but also to audit the policy

 But the Chief Minister sitting in power in Delhi has probably forgotten that Delhi government levies excise duty and VAT on petrol
 bijepi netaa tiwari kaa ye bhi kahana he ki dijal-petrol kii keemten antarrashtriya str par kachche tel kii keemat badhane se prabhavit hai
 He said that the way the Central Government has reduced its tax by two and a half rupees, CM Kejriwal should give relief to the people of Delhi
 tiwari kaa aarope hai ki pichley 2 saal main 15 pratishat se waite 27 pratishat waite kar diya, jiskaa bhaar dilli kii janata par pad rahaa he
 Tiwari said that Kejriwal is taking revenge for the defeat in the MCD election and he should reduce the price of oil in Delhi by at least Rs 5 per liter
 iske saath hi dilli bijepi adhyaksh manoj tiwari ne kaha ki pichley 25 din se safai karmchaaree apni maangon ko lekar ke hadtaal par hai lekin dilli sarkaar ko jo fund centre sarkaar se miltaa he wo fund bhi dilli sarkaar nigam ko bhejne kii bajaay bahaane kar rahi he
 Manoj Tiwari says that the people of Delhi are suffering the brunt of the strike
 tiwari ne centre kii ore se jari fund kii jaankaree dete hue kaha ki karmchaariyon ko abhi tak chauthe vitt ayog kii bakaayaa raashi 10,228 karod rupee nahin mili he
 Also, according to the court order, the government did not give 1904 crore rupees for 2017 and 2018, due to which the employees have gone on strike
 dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne logon ko hajaaron litre muft pani dene kaa vaada to kiya

 Water is also releasing foam and smelling bad

 On the other hand, thousands of liters of clean water is being wasted every day in Mehrauli
 is ilaake main kareeb chah jagahon par jameen se pichley salbhar se lagaataar pani nikal rahaa he
 Jalboard says that this water is not ours

 Broker Arifasarita Vihar by profession has been living in a small flat in Janata Colony since 2006
 parivaar main bete or beti hai
 To say this public flat should be small for a family of common man
 lekin aarifa ke dil kii tarah unke ghar main besahaara or musiibat main fanse jaanwaron ke liye khub sari jagah he
 Arifa's motive for living became her life as she grew up fond of childhood
 unhoneshadike baad bhi ise jari rakhaa
 But the husband did not like this passion of Arifa
 unhone aarifa ke saamne jaanwaron or unke bich main kisi ek ko chunane kii shart rakh di
 At this, Arifa supported the needy animals and since then she lives in her small house with her two children, 25 cats, 20 dogs and many other animals
 aarifa ko pati ke saath-saath mohalle waalon ke virodh kaa bhi saamana karnaa padataa he
 They often talk to their neighbors about the same thing
 unako vaise bhi sarkari yaa aam logon se koi aarthik madad nahin milti he
 Also he has to face opposition
 itani mahangaai main bade hote apane bete or beti kii parvarish karnaa behad mushkil hota he
 But she shelters any injured animal in her home with an open heart
 gandhivadi netaa anna hajaare ne kaha he ki agar janalokapal vidheyak sheetakaaleen satr main nahin aayaa to congress ke khilaaf chalaaungaa janajagran kaa abhiyaan
 Anna's movement will begin with the by-election in Hisar, after which he will visit Uttar Pradesh and urge people not to vote for the Congress
 padhein: twitor-fasebuk kii duniya main anna ne rakhaa kadashanna hajaare ne kaha ki congress ab tak baar-baar vaadon se mukarti rahi he
 While Jan Lokpal is very important for the country interest
 unhone kaha, ‘hisar ke upachunaav main congress ke abtak ke vyavhaar ke bare main logon ko bataaungaa ki kaise wo vaadon se mukarti rahi he
 Also, the late night lathicharge on the fast of Ramdev Baba will be talked about
 ’padhen: anna ne kaha, janalokapal hota to jail main hote chidambarapanna ne kaha ki hisar ke upachunaav ke baad wo uttar pradesh ke daure par bhi jaaenge
 He said that during his visit to Uttar Pradesh, he will sensitize people to vote wisely
 unhone bataaya ki dashahara ke baad unka ye daura prarambh hoga
 Anna said, 'I will start the tour from 13th or 15th after Dussehra
 ’anna ne kaha, ‘congress agar sansad ke sheetakaaleen satr main janalokapal vidheyak nahin aata to sabase pehle uttar pradesh kaa daura karuunga
 After this, i will start my fast there just three days before the election of Uttar Pradesh
 yah anshan lakhanu main hoga
 Read: How Bal Thackeray again targeted Anna, Anna said that even if this bill comes in the winter session, then i will visit there and convince people to vote for the best candidate
 yah puche jane par ki kya congress ke khilaaf prachaar bijepi kaa samarthan nahin he to anna ne kaha ki main aaj tak bijepi yaa sangh ke kisi kaarykram main nahin gaya to main samarthak kaise ho gaya
 He also said that the arrest of Sanjeev Bhatt in Gujarat is wrong
 dekhen: anna main dikhataa he mahatma gandhi kaa aksagandhivadi netaa ne ralegan siddhi main ek samvaadadaata sammelan kaa aayojan kar kaha, ‘hisar ke upachunaav main main logon ko congress ne jo aashwaasan diya he or abtak jo vaadakhilaphi karti aayi he usase avgat karaungaa
 'anna told that his tour is going on in 5 states
 agar congress vaade se mukari to wo janata se congress ko vot nahin dene ko kahenge
 See: Anna said, 'my comparison with Gandhi is not right' Anna said that BJP has given its full support to Jan Lokpal
 bijepi ke adhyaksh ne ek samarthan patr bhi bheja he
 Other parties have also sent their letters of support
 lekin ab tak congress kii ore se koi patr nahin aayaa he
 Anna once again stressed that it is necessary to bring the Jan Lokpal bill
 hamaara mukhya makasad janalokapal he
 Even after conducting a three-time survey in Madhya Pradesh, it has not been able to decide who should be given tickets and who should not be given in the Vidhan Sabha elections
 yahi vajah he ki bijepi ab tikat ke daavedaaron ko lekar kaaryakartaaon kaa man tatol rahi he
 The party has started at the district level to seek suggestions of ticket claimants from the workers across the state
 madhya pradesh main vidhansabha chunaav main tikaton ke daavedaaron ko lekar bhartiya janata party ab apane kaaryakartaaon ko bharose main lene kaa kaam kar rahi he
 For this, the BJP has asked for the feedback of the contenders from all the assembly seats in the state
 isamen har vidhansabha main pradesh ke bade netaaon kii duty lagaai he
 In this opinion, envelopes will be given to the workers, in which they have to write the names of the three contenders of their assembly as per their choice
 is dauraan unhen is baat kaa dhyaan rakhana he ki 3 naamon main se unka khud kaa naam na ho
 Along with every assembly in the state, 6 assembly seats of Bhopal were also held on Wednesday
 bhopal main raishumaari ke liye purv bhaajapa pradesh adhyaksh nandakumar singh chouhan or pravaktaa rajnish agarwal maujuud rahe
 If sources are to be believed, the BJP has already conducted a survey before this, but in view of the feedback received from it and the dissatisfaction of the workers, this opinion is being conducted
 darasal, is raishumaari ke zarie bhaajapa apane kaaryakartaaon kaa gussa dabaanaa chaahati he
 At the same time, the Congress is tightening up on this opinion
 congress netaa maanak agarwal ne kaha ki bhaajapa ko zamin khisakati dikhi, to chunaav se thik pehle kaaryakarta yaad aa gaye
 The BJP knows very well that this time it will have to face the anti-incumbency factor as well as the resentment of the workers
 lihaaja bhaajapa kii koshish he ki jitna ho sake kaaryakartaaon ko saath lekar chalaa jaae
 Please tell that the Election Commission has announced the dates of Madhya Pradesh Vidhan Sabha elections
 yahaan ek charan main matdaan hoga
 There are 230 assembly seats, whose last date for filing nominations is November 9, while the names will be withdrawn by November 14
 yahaan sabhi siton par ek saath 28 november ko matdaan hoga

 After taking charge of UP, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and Jyotiraditya Scindia met with activists from across the state separately and prepared their report
 jaldi is report ke saath donon congress adhyaksh se charchaa karke kai faislon ke aupchaarik elaan karenge
 According to sources, the first question to the workers was to remove or retain the state president Raj Babbar
 is lihaaj se puure aankadon ko ikattha karke jo tasviir ubhari usamen kareeb 75 fisadi se zyaada logon ne rajbabbar ko hataane kii maang kii
 Many activists even said that their glamor can be used in publicity and not in the organization
 isliye unako star nahin pradesh main rahane or puraa vaqt dene vaala netaa chahie
 You can leave the post and fight the election here
 From time to time, Raj Babbar himself has also offered to Rahul to quit the post, but Rahul was constantly in the mood to keep his choice Rajabbar
 ab rajbabbar khud loksabhaa kaa chunaav ladanaa chaahate hai
 For this, he has also started visiting Moradabad and Fatehpur Sikri initially and taking feedback
 ab ek baar phir rajbabbar ne apni manshaa alaakaman ko bataa di, to duusari taraf kaaryakartaaon ne bhi apni manshaa priyanka-sindhiya ke saamne zaahir kar di he
 Raj Babbar has won the Lok Sabha elections from Agra and Firozabad seats
 2014 main vah gajiabad seat se chunaav lade the or bijepi ke wike singh se haare the
 It may be in the formula that UP Congress is likely to get two new presidents soon
 isse ek or samasya kaa bhi samaadhaan ho jayega ki ek adhyaksh, do mahasachivon ke ek saath alag-alag jagahon par hone par kiske saath hoga
 That is, a formula is being prepared for Eastern UP General Secretary Priyanka for Eastern UP Congress President and Western UP General Secretary Scindia for Western UP President, which will be finalized after discussion with Rahul
 priyanka or sindhiya ne liya tha feedbaikabata den, 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main congress uttar pradesh par khaas focus kar rahi he
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi has fielded Priyanka Gandhi and Jyotiraditya Scindia in the UP field
 purvi uttar pradesh kii kaman priyanka gandhi or pashchimi upi kii kaman jyotiraditya sindhiya ko di gai he
 Recently, Priyanka and Jyotiraditya gathered feedback by meeting party officials and workers of 80 Lok Sabha seats in UP
 isse pehle congress ne lakhanu main road sho nikaala tha
 Team India is feeding Sachin Tendulkar, Virender Sehwag or Gautam Gambhir as part of the rotation policy during the ongoing CB Series in Australia, but former India captain and NDTV cricket expert Sunil Gavaskar believes that these three batsmen in every match Should play and this will benefit the team
 gavaskar kii raay main agar team main kisi ko aaraam dena he, to vah rohit sharma or suresh raina main se koi ek hona chahie
 Tendulkar looked in good form in the odis against Sri Lanka and scored 48 runs before being bowled by Angelo Mathews

 We saw (temporarily) unaccompanied Cubs and the discomfort / fright in the presence of jeeps
 Their gay abandon the following day in presence of their mother drove home the point further
 When the pressure is on for signtings, ethics are often compromised
 Habituation results, which is definitely detrimental for the animals
 We need an urgent rethink on how tourism is handled in wildlife reserves

 Xi Jinping has once again occupied the post of President in China
 aise main china ke ek pramukh ranneetijna kaa kahana he ki shi jinping ke duusare kaarykaal main doklam jaise muddon par china sidhe tareeke se deal karegaa
 The strategist says that under the old approach, China will not just try to eliminate differences but will solve the problem directly
 china ke ministry of state security se talluk rakhane vaale ek pramukh think tanks china institutes of kantmparary international relation ke upaadhyaksh yuan peng ne yah baaten kahin
 According to him, when it comes to dominance, territorial integrity and defense of major issues, we will always adopt a dogmatic and strong way, because there will be no scope of compromise in these matters
 peng buudhvaar ko paanch saal main ek baar hone vaale communist party ke congress menchin ke videshi niti ke sambandh main bol rahe the
 When he was asked to clear things by giving an example of Doklamak, he said that it would be fearless on the matter and the conditions of the time
 peng ne doklam or south chin si donon muddon par bolte hue kaha ki pahalechinmatbhed dur karne kii koshish karata tha, ab vah un maamalon main sidhe taur par nipatega
 According to Peng, this is because even though China is trying to resolve differences, each time the other party does not agree
 isliye ab ham samasyaon ko sidhe taur par niptenge or apane uchit sarokaar kii raksha karenge
 At the same Congress, President Xi said that China will try to resolve the differences in a peaceful manner, but other countries should not think that Beijing will continue to digest the issues going through it every time and will not take any action
 shi ke anusaar doklam or south chin si donon muddon par china ne apni prabhutaa kii raksha karte hue or maamle main badi pikchar dekhte hue faisla liya
 According to Yuan, establishing peace in the neighborhood and protecting his sovereignty is not always easy
 koi bhi desh apni prabhutaa or apane phaayde kii keemat par shanti nahin banaae rah saktaa he
 In such a situation, China will not tolerate any such move which will harm China
 bharat kii taraf naram bartaavvahin yuan kii baton se yah prathit hua he ki china kii yah dhamkee chote deshon ke liye thi kyonki bharat ke bare main bolte hue yuan naram dikhaai die
 According to him, the Doklam case is a matter of seeing the big picture in India and China and handling the relationship
 china or bharat donon desh bricks ke sadsy hai or teji se ubhar rahe hai
 In such a situation, the development of both countries should be like brothers
 donon deshon ke bich yuddh hote nahin dekhnaa chahenge
 We would also like to increase the relationship between India and China on the lines of the relationship between China and Russia
 aise main matbhedon vaale maamle ko gambhir or sahi tareeke se nipatane kii jarurat he

 sarkari skool se padhai puri karne vaale dhananjay ko ek chaay kii dukaan se super 30 koching ke bare main pataa chalaa
 Dhananjay met Anand, who runs Super 30 coaching, after saving some money to reach Patna
 iske baad wo iaiti kii pariksha main baithe or phir kya hua ye sab jaanate hai
 Now the twist in the story is that to study electrical in IIT Kharagpur, Dhananjay will have to pay counseling and seat fees, which is 45 thousand rupees
 dhananjay ne bataaya "bank mujhe tabhi lone degaa jab main unhen admician letters dikhaaungaa
 But this will happen later
 philhal to mujhe counselling ke liye 45000 rupye chaiye kyonki wo is maheene kii 12 taarikh tak hi he
 " sirf dhananjay hi nahin madhepur ke sujith kumaar, nalanda ke prem paal or sasaram ke shravan kii bhi yahi haalat he
 Their parents also work as laborers and they too are facing difficulty in raising money
 tippaniyan Anand Kumar, the director of Super 30, said that the government needs the support of poor children to study in institutions like iits
 kuch aise kadam uthaane honge taaki garib parivesh se aane vaale bacchon ke liye raah aasaan ho sake jaise counselling fees ko maaf karnaa hoga
 The bank only gives loan after admission

 org" Controversy continues between Aam Aadmi Party's Youth Manifesto and Ashish Khaitan's comparison with Dharma Ganthras
 iske baad party ke senior netaa punjabi culture sikh rahe hai
 The Sikh leaders of the party are of the view that if the opinion was shown to them by showing them the cover page of this Youth Manifesto before issuing, it would not have been so troubling
 na hi party ko is tarah se publikali maafee maangani padati
 In front of the camera, the Sikh leaders of AAP start defending their party on this issue
 ve log menifesto ko lekar apane hi party ke senior leaderon ke bare main kuch bhi kehane se bachate hai
 Khaitan and Sandhuparty, who were taken away from 'boland Punjab', also sent their leaders Ashish Khaitan and Kanwar Sandhu, who prepared the Youth Manifesto, from the campaign 'boland Punjab' to seek public opinion to prepare the main manifesto in Punjab
 Has also given away
 donon hi netaa pehle is campan kaa ahm hissaa hua karte the
 Kejriwal and Khaitan asked for forgiveness many times, when the national convener of AAP, Arvind Kejriwal came to the Darbar Sahib in Amritsar to apologize on July 18, suspense remains on whether Ashish Khaitan will be with him
 party ke punjab sanyojak succha singh chhotepur ne kaha ki party kai baar stratji ke tahat kisi netaa ko aage kar detii he, kabhi kisi ko peeche bula liya jaataa he
 This is the party's own decision
 khetaan pehle se hi kai baar maafee maang chuke hai
 Another local party leader Himmat Singh Shergill said that Khaitan had already apologized to the people of Punjab many times with folded hands
 ab is baat ko yaheen khatm kar dena chahie
 It is also the opinion of the leaders of Punjab that before speaking, before coming to Punjab from Delhi and speaking in media or public, leaders outside the party of Punjab and Kejriwal himself are also studying Punjab and Sikhism
 
 iske liye party ke sikh netaaon se bhi panth orpunjab ke itihaas ke bare mendilli main baithe netaa raay le rahe hai
 It is also possible to consult Sikh leaders before speaking anything
 punjab ke bare main jaanane main koi buraai nahinsuccha singh ne is bare main kaha ki kisi bhi rajya main jane se pehle vahaan ke bare main study karnaa acchhee baat he
 Kejriwal is already learning Punjabi
 vah punjab ke bare main adhik jaankaree juta rahe hai
 At the same time, Shergill said that senior leadership is also studying about Punjab and keeps taking information from us
 isamen kuch galat nahin he
 Opposition parties are taking a pinch of Kejriwal, while the parties sitting in opposition are taking a pinch after the internal controversy over the manifesto and the study of leadership in Punjab and speaking to local leaders only after speaking about something
 congress vidhayak dal ke netaa charanjit channi ne is masale par kaha ki aam aadmi party ko punjab ke bare main koi jaankaree hi nahin he
 How many of its leaders should study about Punjab, who will not win the upcoming election
 AAP ke gale kii fans bana menifesto vivadkul milakar ye menifesto vivaad punjab main aam aadmi party ke liye gale kii fans ban chukaa he
 The party is trying hard to end the controversy by apologizing to the people of Punjab and the photo printed on the cover page and the statement of Ashish Khaitan, but it does not seem that in the coming days, this ruckus will soon cool down

 Every director has a tried and tested formula which always proves effective and director Vishal Bhardwaj's tried formula is to convert the plays of English litterateur Shakespeare into Hindi films
 philhal ‘maqbool’ or ‘omkara’ ke baad vishaal bharadwaj, haidar’ ke saath aa rahe hai
 'haider' is inspired by William Shakespeare's famous play 'hamlet'
 ‘haidar’ ke saath vishaal wiliam shakespeare ke naatakon par apni tikdi puri karne ja rahe hai
 While some believe that Vishal has thoughtfully placed a bet on 'haider' in view of the failure of his previous film 'matru Ki Bijli Ki Mandola', some people are in a tizzy whether this huge formula of Vishal will work ? See, Vishal Bharadwaj's journey to 'haider' playing the harmonium
 In response to this question, Vishal says, "not this recipe, this is the literature of William Shakespeare
" agar nuskhaa hota to kab kaa khatm ho chukaa hota lekin yah chaar sau saadhe chaar sau saal se chalaa aa rahaa he
 Here is my previous film 'matru'

 kyonkiid ke dauraanunaki maujuudagi se hinsa bhadakne kii ashanka thi
 In this era of looking good and living gracefully, skin care is becoming a part of daily life
 ham rojaanaa twachaa kii kitni dekhbhaal karte hai, yah hamaari umr, ling, saamaajik-aarthik haisiyat or sehat par nirbhar karata he
 Therefore, we should learn the mantra for maximum skin care
 twachaa kii dekhbhaal kis tarah or kaise karen, ise samajhane ke liye sabase pehle yah jaananaa jaruri he ki aapaki twachaa kisi he
 The outer layer of the skin i
e
 the epidermis is the body armor
 katane-fatne se nijaat paane ke liye yah parat har vakt khud ko nae dhang se taiyaar karne kii prakriya main lagi rahati he
 In this process, dead cells (keratin proteins) are formed which climb over other dead cells to form an outer layer
 mrit koshikaon kii parat badaae se twachaa khurduri or kaali padane lagati he
 It is not treated with a moisturizer but an exfoliating cream
 saath hi twachaa ke taileey hone kii vajah ko pahchaanana or uskaa upachaar karnaa bhi jaruri he
 In some people, the entire epidermis begins to thicken as the layer of dead cells increases, as well as the amount of pigments (melanin) in the cells
 is asaamaanya badlaav ko chikitsa jagat kii bhashaa main aconthosis nigarikans (een) kehete hai
 Its symptoms are initially dark circles, changing the color of chin, blackening of the neck and lower part of the armpit
 kuch logon main twachaa badrang hone lagati he
 People with AN typically have more weight than normal
 unhen keel-muhaanse, chehre par bahut zyada bal, kabhi na jane vaali roosi or lagaataar bal girane kii shikaayat rahati he
 Insulin registration (IR) is the most common cause of AN, it is very important to treat this metabolic condition
 iaar se jude nattejey kharaab aane par budhapa samay se pehle aa jaataa he, jhaaiyaan dikhne lagati hai or khaskar gaalon or maathe par kaale dhabbe padane lagate hai or jhurriyaan pad jaati hai
 The lack of vitamin-d also affects the structure and robustness of the epidermis
 paryaavaran pradooshan kii vajah se shahari bharat main yah samasya aam ho gai he
 Due to deficiency of Vitamin D, the skin becomes dry and thick
 hatheliyon or taluon kii khaal sakht ho jaati he or usamen daraaren padane lagati hai
 The inner lining of the skin acts as a dermis cushion and strengthens and protects the vital parts of the skin such as follicles, follicles, oily and sweat glands, arterial nets and nerves
 dermis paraspar guthe hue kolagen reshon or ek duusare main gunthe hue elastic reshon se banati he
 All these proteins are spread in Glu (proteoglycans)
 kolagen ko nuksaan hone se khinchaav ke nishaan pad jate hai
 Once these marks fall, it is almost impossible to erase them
 lekin inhen padane se roka ja saktaa he
 Skin care is a creative process that requires solutions, as needed
 twachaa kii buniyadi dekhbhaal kii shuruyaat clinging yani safai se hoti he
 If we understand well what we are cleaning, then the process becomes clear
 ham twachaa main based bacteria or fafoond, dhul-mitti or paryaavaran pradooshan se utpann gandagi kii safai karte hai
 There is a protective layer of oil on the skin which is the product of the oil glands below it
 is taileey parat kii sanrachana or motaai sharir ke angon ke bich hamaari umr tathaa mausam ke anusaar badalati rahati he
 The imbalance of hormones also changes this
 ham jin chizon ko saaf karnaa chaahate hai ve is tel main chipak jaati hai or ise hataae bina ham puri safai nahin kar sakate
 Therefore it is necessary to remove the oil from soap or cleanser
 moyscharizer uske baad lagaaya jaataa he or use lagaana aapaki marji par he
 Its purpose is to bring the oily layer of skin back to the places where it does not appear to come on its own
 vayaskon visheshkar mahilaon ke liye moyscharising niyamit rup se jaruri he
 But more moisturizing, especially on the face, can also cause acne
 haal ke varshon main bharat main sanscreen products ke niyamit istemaal se suraj kii kirnon se twachaa ke bachaav kaa tarika teji se apanaaya ja rahaa he
 The biggest benefit of applying sunscreen products is at the same time when it is applied in a good amount on the whole face and neck 30 minutes before sun exposure
 britain main kuch saal pehle hue vaigyanik adhyayan main bataaya gaya ki zyaadaatar log jis tarah sanscreen product lagaate hai usase unhen sirf 25 pratishat aavashyak suraksha hi mil paati he
 While trying to eradicate all the blemishes to give our skin a great glow, we must remember that the skin is a mirror of our inner health

 jiske aadhaar par students ko notice diya gaya tha
 He said that this decision has been taken for the benefit of the students only, as there is no chance for them if they do not do well in the coming years

 dhoni ne farvari 2008 se janvari 2009 tak lagaataar 9 maichon main jeet hasil kii thi
 Kohli's series of consecutive wins began against the West Indies from July 6 this year, which is still intact

 The batsmen of Team India did well in the Indore ODI

 But the team's head coach Ravi Shastri made changes and brought Hardik Pandya to fourth place in the third match and his experiment was successful and the team won

 The hosts, who have captured the series, can try the players sitting on the bench in this match
 mohammad shami, umesh yadav or akshar patel is sthiti main plaing ilevan main aa sakate hai
 There is no comeback for the Kangaroos
 The current form for Australia is also a matter of concern

 In the first match, the bowlers got off to a good start but eventually lost the rhythm and then the batsmen could not do their work
 duusare match main bhi lagbhag yahi hua
 The bowler failed when the batsman walked in the third match

 Although Finch's return in the last match strengthened the team, he hit a century as soon as he arrived

 But the silence of Warner and Glenn Maxwell with the bat is a headache for Australia

 gauratlab he ki 1984 main hui is traasadee main 15,000 se zyada logon ne dam tod diya tha
 The US hoped that the decision of the Indian court in connection with the Bhopal gas tragedy would be in the interest of the victims of this accident
 dakshin evam madhya asia maamalon ke sahaayak videsh mantri robert blake ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha ‘‘bhopal ke babat, nishchit taur par vah maanav itihaas kii sabase badi audyogic traasadiyon or audyogic durghatnaon main se ek thi

 Human Resource Development Minister Prakash Javadekar on Thursday denied media reports on the government's intention to make Hindi compulsory
 is baat kii jaankaree unhone twit ke jariye di
 Javadekar said that no language is being given mandatory status in the new National Education Policy (NEP)
 prakaash jaavdekar ne twit kar likhaa, "nai shiksha niti par bani samiti ne apane masauda report main kisi bhashaa ko anivaary karne kii sifarish nahin kii he
 There will be no entrance test for admission in DU: Prakash Javadekar The Committee on New Education Policy in its draft report has not recommended making any language compulsory
 This clarification is necessitated in the wake of mischievous and misleading report in a section of the media
 @ narendramodi @ pmoindia — Prakash Javadekar (@prakashjavdekar) January 10, 2019world Hindi Day 2019: Know- how different this day is from Hindi Day, it is important to clarify this in view of the misleading report of a section of media
 aapako bataa den, 'da indian express' kii ek report main kaha gaya tha ki sarkaar nai shiksha niti main hindi ko kaksha 8 tak anivaary karegi
 However, Javadekar has denied this
 taaki bacchon ke bich ye galat soochna na jaaen
 Now it is not so
 pakistan ke bare main america raksha mantralay ne apni ek report main do took shabdon main kaha he ki vah bharat kii behatar sainya shakti kaa muqabla karne ke liye aatankwaadiyon ko aage badha rahaa he
 Not only this, he is also using such forces to create instability in Afghanistan
 100 pannon se bhi zyada lambii is report main yah bhi kaha gaya he ki afghanistan ke heraat main bhartiya duutavas par hamale main bhi pakistani agenton kaa haath tha
 The Pentagon has said that Pakistan is allowing terrorists to use their land for operations against Afghanistan and India, which could threaten Afghanistan's sovereignty and territorial balance
 is report main kaha gaya he ki yah afghanistan main samjhaute ke pakistan kii patibaddhta ke khilaaf he
 This report is significant in the sense that this is the first time that the Pentagon has openly accused Pakistan of playing a major role in terrorist attacks and instability in neighboring countries
 yah koi nai baat nahin he lekin badi baat yah he ki pentagon ne yah aarope lagaaya he jise us ilaake main hone vaali har ghatana or halchal kaa ilm he
 India did not know how many times in front of the international world, but no major country ever paid attention to them
 bharat ne america ko yah bhi bataaya tha ki uske die dhan or hathiyaaron kaa beja istemaal karke bharat ke khilaaf sajeesh kii ja rahi he
 But the US never paid attention to those things, but now that the water is above the head, the Pentagon also believes that Pakistan has become the base of terrorists who are posing a threat to India and Afghanistan
 report main yah kaha gaya he ki pakistan ko bharat-afghanistan kii mitrataa khatak rahi he or vah us kshetra ko asthir karnaa chahta he
 It is now clear that the government of Pakistan and the ISI are involved in this conspiracy
 kamjor navaj sharif ab fouj ke saamne pehle vaali takat nahin rakhte or iesai kaa ek dhada unki baaten nahin sunata
 These are proving to be a headache for them
 apane astitv kii raksha ke liye vah unki harkaton par chup rah jate hai
 It is not easy for them to control the pony terrorists of ISI and Pakistan Army
 pentagon kii is report ke baad yah ummid kii ja sakati he ki america pakistan par sakhti karegaa or iskaa sidhaa tarika he use di jane vaali madad main baari katautee
 Part of the American assistance to Pakistanis appears in the conspiracy against India
 usase hi hathiyaar kharide jate hai or aatankiyon ko paala posa jaataa he
 If the US stops giving financial aid to Pakistan then it will be impossible for it to do proxy war
 ab gend america nitikaron ke paale main he
 It remains to be seen how much they value stability in the region
 kendriya mantri arun jetali ne buudhvaar ko congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi par jamkar nishaanaa saadhaa
 He said that nowadays some media organizations are doing a story on the Congress President
 jab maine un kahaniyon ko samajhane kii koshish kii or jaankaree jutai to pataa chalaa ki us vyakti (rahul gandhi) ne kabhi bijness kiya hi nahin
 Despite this, he is leading a good life
 videsh yatraaen kar rahaa he
 As on date, every person who needs money in cash is against the electoral bond
 jab tak cash main paise mil rahe the tab kisi ne aawaaj nahin uthaai
 The Rahul and Gandhi families make money from the wealth creation scheme
 pichley kuch varshon main rahul gandhi or unki team ne yah tay kiya ki jo bhi eemaandaaree se apana kaam kar rahaa he
 Make him upset through politics
 rahul gandhi ko samajhnaa chahie ki jo log kaanch ke gharon main rahete hai ve dusron par pathar nahin phenkate
 Whatever i have read and gathered information has revealed these things

 ve sampatti srijan skim chalaate hai
 i challenge the Gandhi family to prove me wrong
 aise kamaate hai sampatti srijan skim searun jetali ne bataaya sampatti srijan skim kaise kaam karti he
 He accused Rahul and Gandhi family that whenever the Congress is in government
 tab ve kaagajon par kisi ko bhi kirayedar bana dete hai
 Then the Gandhi family farmhouse is given to whomever needs to be removed
 wo aapako advance main rupye detaa he
 Not only this, the tenant also pays the salary of the driver and the servant working at the farmhouse
 2004 se 2014 tak yahi hota aayaa
 Then they go to the real estate developer
 wo aapako ek plot bechata he
 You give him the installation
 develper gandhi parivaar ke saath agreement karata he ki aap jo bhi installment denge, usamen aapako nishchit taur par laabh milegaa
 Jignesh Shah's FTIL company was a tenant in the farmhouse of tenant Rahul, a scamster living in a farmhouse
 inhone 16 hajaar niveshkon se kareeb 5800 karod rupye lut liye

 inaki do companiyaan thim
 People's money could be returned by merging the two, but these people did not do so in their government
 usee bich, jignesh shah political equity lekar aae
 After our government came, we merged the company to compensate the investors
 sarkaar banate hi kirayedari khatm ho gai
 After FTIL, he got Unitech's Sanjay Chandra
 unki jaanch 2ji maamle main chal rahi he
 Chandra has been in jail for the last year and a half
 chandra bhi gandhi parivaar ko vaisaa hi phayda pahunchaate the jo real istate develper se miltaa tha
 In retaliation on Mehbooba, Jaitley said - We are following the same rule that was decided by Harun Jaitley on the statement of Mehbooba Mufti that many types of constitutional arguments are being given
 kaha ja rahaa he ki dhara 350 or dhara 35e agar waapas le liye jaaen to kashmir bharat kaa hissaa hi nahin rahegaa
 But Mehbooba does not know that when Maharaja Hari Singh became the princely state of Karna Singh, he too said that the merger of Kashmir into India had the same conditions as the rest of the states
 dhara 370, 26 janvari 1950 main aayaa jabaki vilay usase pehle hua tha
 At the same time, Section 35A came in 1954
 bharat ke samvidhan main kisi bhi prakriya se koi alag ho jaae, iskaa koi praavdhaan nahin he

 When the results of the Bihar Assembly elections were fought at the stake, the other BJP leaders started to cry out, but Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said philosophically that the arithmetic of the election went against the NDA after the formation of the Grand Alliance
 , Hence the loser
 itane bade vakil kii baat ko khaarij nahin kiya ja saktaa
 But if the fate of the party is to be determined by arithmetic instead of Narendra Modi's charisma, then the party will not have to be very enthusiastic about the assembly elections in 5 states in 2016 and 7 states in 2017
 bihar chunaav ke baad baaki dal bijepi ke khilaaf kuch aisi golbandi karne kii koshish kar rahe hai, jaisi golbandi sattar ke dashak main congress ke khilaaf hua karti thi
 The blurred picture of this mobilization will be revealed from the list of leaders who reached the swearing in of Nitish Kumar
 vaise, 2016 main pashchim bengal, tamilnadu, puduccheri, kerala or assam main chunaav hone hai
 Regional parties such as the Trinamool Congress in West Bengal, AIADMK in Tamil Nadu and AINRC in Puducherry
 pehle do rajyon main to mukhya vipakshi dal bhi congress na hokar diemke or vam morcha jaise dal hai
 There are Congress governments in Assam and Kerala
 kerala main vipaksh main vammorcha he to assam main pichley vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi chauthe number kii party thi
 But right here in charge of the Assam BJP, Mahendra Singh reminds, "there has been a miracle in Assam in the Lok Sabha elections under the leadership of Narendra Modi
 hamaara vot bank ek jatke main 11 fisadi badhkar 37 fisadi hua or hamane sabase zyada 7 siten jeetin
 10 Congress mlas have joined BJP
 aise main itihaas main pehali baar assam main camel khil saktaa he
 But despite this enthusiasm, BJP is aware that if the Congress befriends Badruddin Ajmal's All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF), then the party's path can be difficult
 aise main bijepi bhi assam gana parishad ke saath nae rishton kii sambhaavna talashne main jute gai he
 That is, both big parties need the alliance's booty for their survival
 udhar, pashchim bengal main trinmul congress jis tarah lagaataar behatar pradarshan doharaa rahi he, usamen lagata nahin ki vidhansabha chunaav mamata banerjee ke saamne koi apratyaashit chunauti lekar aane vaala he
 On the other hand, in 2017, elections are held in the states of Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Gujarat, Goa, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Manipur
 jaahir he, sabase dilachasp or faislakun muqabla upi kaa hoga
 There is also a fact that the entire coalition of Bihar was dusted off by the BJP, its role was played in the Delhi bungalow of Samajwadi Party President Mulayam Singh Yadav
 yah baat digar he ki har baar kii tarah is baar bhi yadav sabase pehle apane hi banaae gathbandhan se chalaang maar gaye
 Their confusion is grounded
 uttar pradesh main pichley loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ne itane vot hasil kiye the ki sapa or bispi ke vot jod bhi liye jaaen to bhi camel se kam hi the
 In such a situation, the grand alliance of sp-bsp-congress on the lines of Bihar can be guaranteed to win, but there is no possibility of it at the moment
 haa, congress yaa ajit singh kaa rashtriya lokdal kisi party ke saath judakar gathbandhan jarur kara saktaa he
 However, Nirmal Khatri, president of the Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee, says, "the BSP has gone with the BJP earlier too and the SP was fighting only to win the BJP in Bihar
" congress apane dam par taiyaari main juty he
 "but they are not even canceling all possibilities of the alliance
 udhar sapa ke rashtriya mahasachiv naresh agarwal kaa satark jawaab he, “gathbandhan par koi bhi faisla netaji hi karenge
 "however, Agarwal agrees that after Bihar's defeat, an atmosphere is being created against the BJP in the country and this can lead to a certain kind of understanding among various political parties
 uttarakhand kaa ganit or dilachasp he
 In the 2012 assembly elections, there was a difference of only one seat and half per cent of votes between the Congress and BJP, while the BSP got 12 per cent votes
 aise main bispi se madhur rishte congress kaa bhagya jagaa sakate hai
 In Punjab, BJP contests on the basis of local power Shiromani Akali Dal (badal)
 is baar akaliyon kii haalat kamjor bataai ja rahi he to aam aadmi party ne chauthi takat ke taur par pravesh kiya he
 That is, the alliance of the state will depend on the immediate relationship of the four parties
 haa, bijepi kaa gujarat durg philhal kisi bhi tarah ke gathjod se surakshit he, ab agar patel aarakshan kaa mudda tool pakad jaae to alag baat

 ' britain ke pradhanmantri boris johnson ne kaha ki no-deal bracit (jaaniye kya he bracit) vifaltaa maani jaaegi or iske liye british va irish sarkarein jimmedaar hongi
 He reiterated that it is necessary for the country to leave the EU by 31 October

 Addressing the media here with Varadkar, Johnson said, "I noticed no-deal (no deal)"
 
 Yes, we can, Britain can certainly succeed, but there is no doubt that this will result in failure of governance, for which we will all be responsible
 "burka pahane mahilaon ko britain ke piem ne bolaa 'letterbox', sikh saansad ne yun diya karaara jawaab

 If implemented, Northern Ireland would support some of the EU single market rules, but after Brexit the UK and EU would not agree on a trade deal
 kya he bracit? aakhir kaise Brexit kii vajah se phir gir sakati he britain kii sarkaar, jaaniye yahaan As of now, we are not able to get out of the land acquisition bill itself, so think about Aadhaar? The premise is about the project
 haal hi main supreme court ne kade shabdon main sarkaar se poocha ki jab aadhaar anivaary nahin he to maangate nnyon ho? court ne sarkaar ko chetavanee di ki 23 sitambar, 2013 ke aadesh kaa paalan kiya jaae, jisamen kaha gaya tha ki aadhaar card nahin hone kii vajah se kisi bhi vyakti ko laabh kii yojanaon se vanchit nahin kiya ja saktaa
 In such a situation, it is now difficult for the government to carry forward its cash transfer scheme, so how to increase it
 darasal vipaksh main rahete hue bijepi ne aadhaar pariyojna par na sirf sawaal uthaae the, balki bijepi kii rahanumai vaali vitt maamalon kii sansad kii sthaayee samiti ne shd athurity of india bill- 201'' ko niztaa main dakhal or suraksha ke saath khilwaad qaraar dete hue khaarij kar diya tha
 Now the BJP itself is in power and has made Aadhaar its dream project
 lekin modi sarkaar fouran bill laakar aadhaar pariyojna kii sanstha yuidi ko vaidhanik darja dene se parhez kar rahi he
 However, the government was in a bit of a cunning mood to take this process forward
 pehle jan-dhan yojana ke tahat bank khate khulwaaye or duusari taraf aadhaar card ke panjikaran kii prakriya tej karvaa di
 After that, the government added half a dozen schemes to Aadhaar in the first five months
 haalanki ise anivaary banane se sarkaar ne parhez kiya
 But they started forcing people to make Aadhaar cards by linking them to schemes
 dilli jaisi kuch rajya sarkaron ne laabh kii yojanaon se itar shaadi ke panjikaran, rashan card or sampattiyon kii kharid-bikri aadi ke liye ise anivaary bhi kar diya, jis par supreme court ne kadi aapatti jaahir kii
 Why confusion remains Senior officials of the UIDAI believe that the confusion over the base is the worst case of this plan
 saamaanya taur par is tarah kaa kaam grih mantralay ke adheen aata he, lekin jab 13 agast, 2009 ko praadhikaran ne pehla dastavej jari kiya to usamen aadhaar ko vaikalpik bataaya kyonki tab neshnal population register (enpiaar) kii bhi baat thi, jo philhal thap he
 The motive behind Aadhaar was to help service delivery to the needy
 iske liye 2010 main sarkaar sansad main bill lekar ai, lekin tab vipaksh main rahete hue bijepi ne iskaa virodh kiya
 Some former Aadhaar officials at the time say that the standing committee had to consider the merits of the project, but the committee deviated and rejected the bill
 haalanki manmohan cabinet ne samiti kii siforeeshon ko nahin mana
 Now this bill is with the new government
 upie sarkaar kii tarah hi endie sarkaar ne bhi is yojana main hadabadi dikhaai
 Union Minister of State for Petroleum Dharmendra Pradhan implemented the plan to transfer LPG subsidy directly to the bank account on November 15, 2014, in the 52 districts in which the UPA government had done it
 uske baad janvari, 2015 se ise desh bhar main lagu kiya gaya
 While the Aadhaar card has not been issued in the entire country
 khud pradhanmantri narendra modi ne yuidi ko june, 2015 tak kaa lakshya diya tha
 But UIDAI believes that in any case it is not possible to complete this work before March 2016
 lekin yahaan sarkaar ne chaturaai kii or bank khate ko anivaary kiya or aadhaar banavaane ke liye logon ko jaagruk karne ke naam par dabaav daalaa jane laga jisase kai gas agenciyon par logon kaa gussa bhi footataa dikhaa
 The reason for the confusion is that the government is unclear about how many schemes to include in direct cash transfer (DBT)
 isliye kahin shaadi ke panjikaran to kahin jameen kii kharid-bikri to kahin rashan card ko lekar aadhaar anivaary hone laga
 While the government wanted to first complete the campaign to build Aadhar across the country, and then proceed with these plans
 ab matadaata pahchaan patr main bhi aadhaar ko anivaary kiya ja rahaa he
 However, right now the Election Commission is talking about seeking Aadhaar from the identity card holders
