 Now a new bench will be built for this

 Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi said that today we will not hear the matter, but will set a time limit
 is maamle kii sunwaayee ab 29 janvari se hona tay kiya gaya he
 Rajeev Dhawan said that he wanted to tell the court that in early 1994, Justice UU Lalit had appeared on behalf of Kalyan Singh in a contempt case in the court

 He said, 'I just want to bring this thing in front of Lordship
 hamen is masale kii sunwaayee main koi aapatti nahin he
 Now it is completely up to you
 mujhe khed he ki or main aisa masalaa uthaanaa nahin chahta tha
 On this, the CJI said that what is the matter of regret in this, you have just told the facts
 haalanki, upi sarkaar ke vakil harish salve ne kaha ki justise yuyuu lalit ke peeth main shaamil hone se unhen koi dikkat nahin he
 But after taking up such a case, Justice YU Lalit has distanced himself from the issue
 chif justise ranjan gogoi ne is bare main jaankaree di
 Apart from this, Rajiv Dhawan also questioned the constitution bench, saying that the matter was earlier with the bench of 3 judges but suddenly the matter went before the bench of 5 judges, on which no judicial order was issued
 haalanki, supreme court ne kaha ki samvidhan peeth kaa gathan karnaa chif justise kaa adhikaar he

 bharat main pehali dakshin panthi sarkaar kaa aana aitihaasik tha
 The defeat of the BJP was greater than the victory of Congress in 2004

 India is the biggest victim of terror

 In the last decade, terrorism has taken 42 thousand lives in India
 aatankwaad kii vajah se hamane kaaphi khun bahaya he
 It was as if we would have to live under the shadow of attacks

 The international face of India has changed a lot in the past decade

 The India nuclear deal made it clear that India and America are natural allies

 afghanistan main aatank ke khilaaf jang najuk daur main he
 Political interests may force Obama to step down
 yaad rakhen ki bharat ke bhi afghanistan main kaaphi hit hai kuch kii aapatti par aatank ke khilaaf jang roki nahin ja sakati
 There will be no justice for India battling terror if its neighbors do not improve
 vaise khun ke kuch dhabbon ko chhod den to is dashak kaa rang haraa bhi tha
 Attempts to save the Earth were not agreed in Copenhagen, but Copenhagen created a great consciousness to protect the environment

 We should improve such market conditions with international cooperation
 bhavishya ke anishchit se hamaari aaj kii ummiden dagamagaa rahi hai magar ye sach he ki aane vaali leadership bhavishya sanvaar degi
 By leadership i mean leadership that makes strong decisions
 ham jaanate hai ki satta kii majaburiyaan badlaav kaa rasta roak detii hai
 Look at the difference between candidate Obama and President Obama? We have great expectations of development in many areas
 raajnneeti, arthvyavastha, suraksha, paryaavaran main ham badi ummiden rakhte hai auki ham ummid karte hai bharat kai morchon par duniya kaa maargdarshan karegaa
 There is immense growth potential in the country due to immense youth power

 After the Telugu Desam Party parted from the National Democratic Alliance to demand special status for Andhra Pradesh, BJP President Amit Shah on Saturday wrote a letter to the TDP chief and the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, calling the decision politically motivated and unilateral

 vahiin andhra pradesh ke mukhyamantri chandrababu naidu ne patr kaa jawaab de diya he
 On Saturday, Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu accused the BJP of spreading lies
 patr ke jawaab main naidu ne kaha ki shah ne apane letters main aarope lagaaya he ki andhra sarkaar centre dwaara die gaye fund ko istemaal karne main naakaamayaab rahi
 In such a situation, he is saying that the Andhra government is unable
 haalanki main bataanaa chaahunga ki unki sarkaar main jidipi or krishi vyavastha kaaphi acchhee he
 Many national awards have also been received for this
 naidu ne kaha ki yahi hamaari asli kshamta he, aise main aap kyon jhooth failaa rahe hai
 Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu further said that the Kishaka letter is full of lies
 saath hi kaha ki centre ke isi swabhaav kii vajah se rajya main kai industrion kaa vikaas nahin ho paaya
 Naidu accused the Center of giving more attention to the North East states
 naidu ke anusaar agar purvottar rajyon kii tarah unhen bhi saath mila hota to unke rajya main bhi kai industry aati
 Shah had termed Naidu's decision as unfortunate
 Let me tell you that earlier in his letter Shah had said that the Modi government's commitment to the development of Andhra Pradesh is firm and no one can question it
 rajg se alag hone ke naidu ke faisle ko durbhypurna qaraar dete hue shah ne patr main kaha ki yah faisla puri tarah se raajnneeti se prerit he or isamen pradesh ke vikaas ko darkinar kiya gaya he
 Shah wrote that BJP has always believed in the politics of development and working and this is our source of inspiration
 shah ne likhaa ki andhra pradesh ke bantwaare se lekar ajtak bijepi ne hameshaa andhra pradesh ke logon kii aawaaj ko uthaaya he or logon ke hiton ke liye kaam kiya he
 We constantly think about the interest of the Telugu people and the Telugu state
 congress ne pradesh ke bantwaare main logon ke hiton kaa khyaal nahin rakhaa, jisaki vajah se logon ko mushkil kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 The Congress did not take care of the sentiments of the people during the Partition
 shah ne chandrababu naidu ko dilaai 2014 kii yadachandrababu naidu ko 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav kii yaad dilaate hue shah ne likhaa ki jab rajyasabha or loksabhaa main aapaki party ke paas paryaapt sankhya nahin thi, tab bhi bijepi ne is baat ko praathamikta se sadan main uthaaya or pradesh ke logon ko nyaay dilaane kii baat kahi thi
 Significantly, Chandrababu Naidu has decided to part ways with the NDA alliance to demand a separate statehood status for Andhra Pradesh
 shah ne apane patr main likhaa ki andhra pradesh kaa vikaas hamaari sarkaar ke agenda main sabase upar he or iskaa udaahan he ki ham pradesh main shaikshanik santhaan, aadharbhoot sanrachana samet anek vikaas kaaryo main vishesh sahyog de rahe hai

 ali shaan ne 49wein minute main vah gol daaga

 khel ke antim kshanon main bharat ko teen penlti corner mili, lekin vah uskaa phayda nahin uthaa paaya
 India's 3–1 lead proved decisive
 bharat ko is mukaable main paanch penlti corner mili, jisamen se vah ek ko hi canwart kar paaya

 dilli ke palam ilaake main sampatti vivaad ko lekar do-do hatya kaa maamla saamne aayaa he
 The police have registered a case against the accused, although he has not been arrested so far
 police ke mutabik, donon hatya karne vaala mritkon kaa rishtedaar hi he
 The younger brother shot and killed his own sister-in-law and nephew over an ongoing property dispute with the elder brother
 daramil palam ilaake main pramod apane parivaar ke saath rahata tha
 a few days later, his elder brother Praveen also came to live with his family
 palam ke jis makaan main parivaar rahata tha, usee makaan ko lekar donon bhaaiyon ke bich kaaphi dinon se vivaad chalaa rahaa tha
 It is being told that on Sunday, Pramod first shot his nephew on the floor of the house and closed the door and waited for his sister-in-law Deepa under the house
 uski bhabhi deepa us samay kisi kaam se apane duusare makaan par gai thi
 As soon as Deepa reached the second house in Palam, Pramod, who was waiting under the house, also fired on him
 deepa kii ghar ke baahar hi maukey par hi maut ho gai
 When Pramod opened fire on his sister-in-law Deepa, he also had two children with Deepa
 ganimat rahi ki pramod ne donon chote bacchon ko kuch nahin kiya or maukey se faraar ho gaya
 Deepa and her son Rishi died in this incident
 soochna paakar maukey par pahunchi police ko deepa kii laash ghar ke baahar, jabaki maasumbache kii lashflatt ke andar padi mili
 This double murder spread sensation in the area
 police tamaam angel se jaanch main juty he ki vaardaat main akelaa pramod hi shaamil tha yaa koi or bhi ore vaardaat ke peeche asli kahani ko bhi talasha ja rahaa he
 The biggest court is once again in trouble, as it is not just allegations of sexual harassment against Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi but also the charge of lawyer Utsav Bains
 bains ke mutabik, kuch corporate lobby chif justise ko badnaam karne kii sajeesh main lage hai
 In this case, a special bench of three judges on Thursday gave the former Supreme Court judge AK Patnaik the responsibility of investigating this alleged conspiracy
 indira jaisingh ham khush hai ki justise patnayak ko jaanch kii jimmedaari di gai he
 We will also support them fully
 sunwaayee ke dauraan court ne kaaphi sakht tippaniyan bhi kin, masalan court ne kaha ki samay aa gaya he jab ham dhan or bahubali yani khud ko taqatvar samajhane waalon ko bataa den kii aap sansthaanon ko nahin chalaa sakate
 People who understand this are playing with fire
 ye khatm hona chahie
 Because the system wants to be repaired and there are conspiracies to discredit and eliminate it
 ab or aisa nahin chalegaa
 The allegations of fixing are serious
 mat sochen ki fiksar yaa dhanwaan log supreme court ko chalaa rahe hai
 The investigation will start from today, on the other hand, the inhouse committee of three judges is going to start the investigation of the case of sexual harassment charges on Friday
 lekin is samiti main shaamil justise envi ramana ne khud ko sunwaayee se alag kar liya he
 The alleged victim objected to the Supreme Court by writing a letter to the inquiry committee that Justice Ramana is a family friend of CJI Gogoi
 ab sijeai sabhi jajon kii raay se panel main duusare jaj ko shaamil karne kii adhisuchana jari karenge to jaanch aage badhegi
 Also read: CJI Case: From allegations to action, know what is the whole matter is not the first time when a case has come against the Chief Justice of the country
 justise gogoi se thik pehle jab justise deepak mishra CJI the to mahabhiyog kii prakriya shuru karne kaa shor machaa
 Now of sexual harassment on Justice Gogoi
 tab bhi or ab bhi chhavi to nyaaypalika kii hi bigadati he
 These are the aspects
 
 
 -aarope he ki fixrs kaa giroh supreme court main bench fiks karne kii koshish main rahata he 
 - Are the court sacked employees and others involved in the conspiracy to implicate the Chief Justice? british vaigyanikon ne daawa kiya he ki bharat se duniya bhar main ek aisa bacteria fail rahaa he, jiskaa koi ilaaj nahin he
 British scientists have not given it NDM-1, while in general it is being called New Delhi bacteria
 darasal yah ek tarah kaa anzime he, jo agar kisi bacteria main chalaa jaae, to us par koi dawa asar nahin karti
 This bacteria is found in those patients who have returned from India or Pakistan undergoing surgery
 is bacteria se gastric problem shuru ho jaati hai, jiske chalate multiple organ felyor or marij kii maut tak hone kii ashanka rahati he
 Its patients may show early symptoms like urination and infection
 british vaigyanikon ne is superbag ko duniya ke liye khatra bataaya he
 However, Indian doctors have denied that this superbug originated in India
 unka kahana he ki ho saktaa he ki yah pashchimi propaganda kaa hissaa ho
 At the same time, concern was also raised in the Parliament on superbugs
 bijepi ke eses ahaluwalia ne maamle par chintaa jataate hue kaha ki yah sambhavit saazish bhi ho sakati he
 Congress's Jayanthi Natarajan also supported Ahluwalia
 vahiin sarkaar kii taraf se prithviraj chouhan ne kaha ki vah maamle kii jaanch karakar report saunpenge
 As such, the power of vote is considered to be the most important in a democracy
 lekin ek shakti sahyogi dalon kii bhi hoti he, jo satta ke shikhar tak pahunchane ke liye behad nirnaayak sabit hoti he
 It has also been the most important link in the history of Indian politics
 yahi vajah he ki chunavi sijan main gathbandhan dalon kii naaraazgi, netaaon kaa maan-manuval jaisi sargharmiyaan aam ho jaati hai
 Now that the 2019 Lok Sabha elections are over, the resentment of loved ones is bound to emerge
 sattadhari bijepi bhi isse achhuti nahin he
 BJP colleagues have also started showing him eyes
 satta kaa swaad chakhne ke baad kisi ne daaman chhod diya he, to koi sharten lagu kar aage kaa rasta tay karnaa chahta he
 That is, the BJP, which has pledged to rule the country for 50 years, can now worry its own people
 narendra modi ke netritv main 2014 loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ne itihaas rachate hue 282 siton par jeet darj kii
 This was the first time the BJP got a thumping majority
 26 may 2014 ko endie kii sarkaar bani or narendra modi ne pradhanmantri pad kii shapath lee
 Ministers were also sworn in from the quota of NDA partners Shiv Sena and other parties including TDP
 lekin jaise-jaise 2019 kaa chunaav kareeb aata rahaa, tidipi or shivasena kii naaraazgi khulkar saamne aati gai
 TDP left After Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu decided to break away from the NDA after being part of the Modi government for four years
 andhra pradesh ko vishesh rajya kaa darja dene kii maang par modi sarkaar se dhokhaa milane ke aarope lagaate hue march 2018 main tidipi ne bijepi kaa saath chhod diya
 Both ministers also resigned from the Modi cabinet from the TDP quota
 tidipi ek majboot kshetreey dal ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 In 2014, the party contested 30 seats and won 16
 dakshin bharat main kamjor maani jane vaali bijepi ko tidipi kii takat kaa bada phayda mil saktaa tha, lekin philhal donon kii raahen alag hai
 Shiv Sena will contest elections separately! Maharashtra's Shiv Sena, which is said to be close to BJP, has also announced its displeasure
 haalanki, donon dal gathbandhan main maharashtra sarkaar chalaa rahe hai, lekin notebandi jaise rashtriya muddon par shivasena bijepi ke virodh main khadi najar ai he
 There has been frequent rhetoric of tussle between the two parties
 shivasena khule taur par bijepi ke saath chunaav na ladane kii ghoshnaa kar chuki he
 However, on the occasion of the completion of four years of the Modi government, BJP Amit Shah went to Mumbai and met Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray, but Shiv Sena's attitude is still bitter
 loksabhaa chunaav ke baad 2014 main hi maharashtra vidhansabha chunaav hue the, jisamen bijepi ne shandaar pradarshan kiya tha
 The Shiv Sena supported the BJP that emerged as the largest party and formed a coalition government
 loksabhaa ke samikarnon kii baat kii jaae to rajya main kul 48 siten hai
 In the 2014 elections, Shiv Sena won 18 of these seats, while BJP got 22 seats
 aise main shivasena kaa janaa bhi bijepi ko is bade rajya main baari nuksaan de saktaa he
 In Jammu and Kashmir, the regional party PDP did not form part of the NDA in the Central Government, but no party got a majority when the Kashmir Assembly elections were held in late 2014
 jiske baad bijepi ne pidipi ko samarthan kaa elaan kiya or mufti mohammad said ke netritv main pidipi ne sarkaar banaai
 After the death of Mufti Saeed, his daughter Mehbooba Mufti took charge of the province
 donon dalon ke bich vaicharik matbhed hone ke baavjood ye gathbandhan chaar saal tak chalata rahaa or aakhirkaar isi maheene (june 2018) bijepi ne apana samarthan waapas le liya
 From the point of view of the Lok Sabha elections, the PDP is in a strong position in Jammu and Kashmir
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main modi lahar ke bich party ko rajya kii 6 loksabhaa siton main 3 par jeet mili thi
 While BJP won the remaining 3 seats
 ab jabaki 2019 kaa chunaav aane vaala he, to usase pehle hi donon dalon ke sambandh khatm ho chuke hai
 In Bihar, JDU leader Nitish Kumar has formed a government with BJP by breaking the grand alliance with Lalu Yadav's RJD and Congress
 lekin loksabhaa chunaav ko lekar donon dalon ke bich ab tak sab sahi nahin chal rahaa he
 There is rhetoric between the leaders of both parties on seat sharing
 media reports ke mutabik, jahaan bijepi ke sthaneey netaa alag chunaav ladane kii koshish ko bal de rahe hai, vahiin jediu ne saaf taur par kah diya he ki bijepi chaahe to akele sabhi 40 siton par lard sakati he
 Actually, here BJP wants to distribute seats on the 2014 formula
 2014 main bijepi ne 40 main se 22 siton par jeet hasil kii thi
 The party wants to compromise on the basis of the result of the last Lok Sabha elections
 jabaki bijepi ke is aadhaar ko jediu galat maan rahi he
 JDU says 2019 should not be considered as 2014
 khabar ye he ki jediu jahaan 25 siton kii maang kar rahi he, to vahiin bijepi 22 siton se kam par ladane ko raji nahin he
 However, in 2014 JDU won just 2 seats
 in bade dalon ke alaava chote dal bhi bijepi ke liye fans bane hue hai
 Bharatiya Suheldev Party President Om Prakash Rajbhar, an ally in the UP government, is openly presenting a challenge to the BJP
 aise main ek taraf jahaan congress tamaam bijepi virdohi dalon ko ekajute kar narendra modi ko satta se bedakhal karne kii yojana par kaam kar rahi he, vahiin lambii pari khilne kaa pran lene vaali bijepi ke apane hi khilaadi uske gale kii haddi banate dikhaai de rahe hai

 If a government has not only started many schemes keeping in mind the problems of such a large section of the society, but has also implemented them smoothly, then there is no doubt that its popularity will remain intact for a long time

 Barack Obama, who was President of the US for eight years, addressed his country to the people for the last time
 apni ferewel spich main obama ne kaha ki mishael or mujhe pichley kuch hafton se shubhakamanaayen mil rahi hai
 Today i want to thank you
 har din maine aapse siikhaa
 You guys made me better president and human being

 pichley aath saal main ek bhiaatanki hamalanhin hua
 However he said that Boston and Orlando remind us how dangerous bigotry can be
 hamaari agenciyon pehle se kahin adhik prabhavi hai

 ham giren yaa uthen hamen saath hona chahie
 In the coming 10 days, the country will once again see the strength of our democracy, how a elected president takes power
 loktantr ke liye kaam karnaa hameshaa se mushkil rahaa he
 Calling democracy in the country a threat from racism, inequality and a harmful political environment, Obama called on Americans to unite to protect it

 Therefore, we as citizens should be vigilant about external aggression

 jis mahila ke saath badasluki hui uske khilaaf pehle se naa to aniatik sambandhon kii koi shikaayat police main darj he or naa hi koi exiaar
 The Khap Panchayat gave a decree in front of everyone to tear and beat the woman's clothes in public place
 phir khud hi khap panchayat kii sadasyon ne kai purushon kii maujuudagi main hi pehle mahila ke kapade phaade, galigalouj kiya or phir juute-chappalon se jamkar pitayee kii
 The woman kept pleading with Rahm from the crowd but no one listened to her
 mahila ke saath hui badasluki kaa video bhi saamne aayaa he
 SP of Western Tripura Ajit Pratap Singh says that it has been reported that misbehavior with a woman has been done by some women
 espi ke mutabik jis jis ne bhi mahilaon ke saath badasluki kii unke khilaaf sakht karrwai kii jaaegi
 It is being told that other members of the family including the husband of the victim woman have also been banished from the village
 ye parivaar gaanv main kiraye ke ek makaan main rahata tha
 The most disturbing thing in this incident is that the woman was harassed in front of the crowd and no one tried to save her
 jis jagah ye ghatana hui wo tripura kii rajdhani ke paas hi sthit he
 If the Khap Panchayat in the vicinity of the capital is so fearless and crosses all limits in punishing a woman, then the situation in the far flung areas of the state itself can be understood

 unhone kaha ki sudhaa bhargav hindibhashi hai, lekin jo chitthee unki likhi bataai ja rahi he usamen marathi shabd bhi hai
 Seeing this letter, the bench remarked, 'yes, it can only be written by Marathi speakers
 saath hi likhane main aadha chandramaa bhi marathi hi istemaal karte hai
 Earlier during the hearing, Abhishek Manu Singhvi said, "it has been nine months but the government has not been able to apply for transit remand even after being accused of being Maoist
" ab achaanak yah kadam kyon uthaaya ja rahaa he? bina court aadesh ke aropiyon kii giraftaar ke liye police bal kaa ye ection katai gaiyrkanoonee tha
 He said that the transit remand application is based on Bhima Koregaon, but it is not mentioned anywhere in the three letters submitted by the police
 iske baad court ne police kii cese diary talab kii
 While giving a diary, Tushar Mehta said that it is in Marathi
 is par court ne kaha ki ham marathi samaj lenge
 On this, Singhvi said that there are judges knowing Marathi in this bench, so you will get ease
 hamen ye suvidha nahin he
 Harish Salve said that if this investigation is revealing the misdeeds of illegal workers, then the investigation should go ahead
 unhone esaiti banane kii maang par kaha ki aajkal to sabhi piiel main esaiti banane kii hi yachana hoti he, kyonki court bhi aksar esaiti banaakar jaanch kaa aadesh de detaa he
 Earlier, Harish Salve said, in many cases the court makes SIT
 isse janata main ye chhavi ban rahi he ki sibiai, enie jaisi agenciyaan avishwasaneey hai, tabhi lagbhag har piiel main esaiti kii maang copy-paste kii tarah hoti he
 During the hearing, Singhvi said that these letters were also mentioned in the discussion on a TV channel
 ve chitthiyaan news channel ko kaise milin? itane gopneey dastavej kaise saarvajanik hue? singhvi ne chitthee kaa hawala diya to harish salve ne yachikakartaon ke paas chitthee aane par sawaal uthaaya
 On this, Singhvi said that this letter is present on the website of many news channels
 sunwaayee ke dauraanbench main shaamil justise khanvilakar ne poocha ki jo material police ne ikattha kiya he, uskaa giraftaar logon se kya sambandh he? isi dauraan tushaar mehta ne aropiyon ke bich hue samvaad kaa byora diya
 Tushar Mehta said during the hearing that Prakash Chetan and G
 Saibaba are the names of the same man
 vah na keval hindi jaanata he balki hindi main bhaashan bhi detaa he
 The letter written to him also mentions several conspiracies and meetings of the Eastern Regional Bureau (ERB)
 unhone kaha ki aropiyon se mili dastavejon main kai jagah aisi gambhir baaten hai jinhen court main bolkar padhanaa uchit nahin he
 There are many codes in the correspondence of the accused
 masalan lo intencity combat ko (LIC) kaha gaya he
 On this, Singhvi said that if Prakash and Saibaba are the same man, how can one write a letter while in jail
 is maamle kii sunwaayee puri ho chuki he or ab donon pakshon se likhit main apana jawaab dene ko kaha gaya he
 The deadline to respond is until next Saturday

 kavi surendra sharma, arun jaimini or sunil jogi ne apane vyang se puri mehfil lut lee
 Poet Surendra Sharma coined such wells and rivers, which everyone began to wow after hearing
 vahiin, haryana kii ranjiti par arun jaimini ne tikhe vyang kiye, jabaki sunil jogi ne 'mushkil he apana mail priye' se samaa baandha
 Stay away from all those who give messages
 
 
 kavi surendra sharma ne kaha ki main ek sandesh dena chahta hum, jitne sandesh dene vaale hai unase bachakar rahen
 If you take your own decision then you will be able to live a better life
 main poochna chahta hum ki kisne varna vyavastha banaai
 If Ram's Sabaris can eat plum, then why can't Sabri go to Ram's temple
 surendra sharma ne kaha ki jindagi main kisi garib kaa majaak mat udaana kyonki ishwar ke liye har cheez mahatvapurn he
 He said that all Indians going to America will get sad, but money is with everyone
 koi ye nahin kahata seth bhookha hum roti khilaade
 Amiri's airs remain as long as poverty beholds
 garibi niharna band kar degi to amiri kii akad khatm ho jaaegi
 Click here for registration in Sahitya Aaj Tak, while narrating an anecdote on this, Surendra Sharma said that the river swagger said to the well, "what is your avakat, you know?" He said with folded hands, there is a difference between disorientation and stagnation
 pyaasa mere paas aata he or tum pyaase ke paas jaati ho

 The Delhi Commission for Women has sent its recommendations to the Delhi government for the improvement of the Bagger Home (monk house) located in the Nirmal Chhaya Complex
 ayog ne is home kii kharaab haalat ke liye jimmedaar, adhikariyon ke khilaaf sakht karrwai karne kii sifarish kii he
 On 4 January last month, Delhi Women's Commission chairperson Swati Maliwal conducted a surprise inspection of the Bagger Home with her team
 ayog kii adhyaksh ne puri raat bager main home main rahane-khaane kii vyavastha or saaf safai aadi kaa nirikshan kiya or jisamen bahut sari khamiyaan pai gayi
 After this, on 8 February, he visited there at 5 in the morning
 ayog kii team ne apane nirikshan ke dauraan vahaan maanavadhikaron kaa ulanghan bhi paaya tha
 After this, the investigation was done for a month and has now sent its recommendation to the Delhi government for improvement
 ayog ko auchak nirikshan ke dauraan pataa chalaa ki bager home main jab videshi mahilaayein aati hai to vahaan castaff unke privet part tak chack kartaahe jo ki sidhaa-sidhaa maanavadhikaron kaa ulanghan hai
 This was also confirmed by the staff there
 ayog ne apni sifarish main is tarah kii jaanch to turant prabhaav se band karne ke liye kaha he
 Also, there is talk of installing equipment for investigation there
 ayog ne jaanch main paaya tha ki maansik rup se aksham mahilaayein, bager home main rahane vaali anya mahilaon kaa khaanaa taiyaar karti hai
 Asha Jyoti Home and Bagger Home have the same kitchen
 ek cook or ek sahaayak hi bager home or aashaa jyoti main rahane vaali 80 mahilaon ke liye khaanaa taiyaar karte hai
 Women who cook also do not take care of cleanliness
 ayog ne sifarish kii he ki bager home ke liye paryaapt sankhya main cook or sahaayakon ko niyukt kiya jaae or maansik rup se aksham mahilaon se khaanaa banvaanaa turant prabhaav se band kiya jaae
 The team of the Commission found in inspection that even foreign women living there are not given enough clothes to wear
 ek uzbek mahila ne bataaya ki usne 22 din se kapade nahin badale hai kyonki unhen pahanane ke liye duusare kapade nahin die gaye hai
 Apart from this, the Commission found that mattresses have not been provided for sleeping here
 ayog ne sifarish kii he ki unhen pahanane ke liye paryaapt kapade or sone ke liye gadde muhaiyaa karaaye jaaen
 Bagger Home has been used as detainee home for many years to accommodate foreign women
 inke rahane ke liye kis tarah kaa ditten home hona chahie is par grih mantralay or anya kisi vibhaag ne aaj tak koi ruchi nahin dikhaai he
 In addition, a woman living in the Bagger Home had complained during the commission's inspection that she was molested by the Fourner Regional Registration Officer (FRRO)
 yahaan shikaayat ke samaadhaan kii koi vyavastha nahin he
 The Commission has written in its recommendation that a regulation should be made after discussing with the concerned departments to improve the bagger home
 saath hi shikayaton ke nivaaran ke liye zarurat padane par police kii sahaayta bhi lee jaani chahie
 There is no separate arrangement for the care and catering of sick and pregnant women in the Bagger Home
 ayog kaa maananaa he ki aisi mahilaon kii dekhbhaal or unke khanpan kii vishesh vyavastha hona jaruri he
 Nirmal Chhaya Complex has around 1500 girls and women living in different houses but there are only 2 doctors to take care of them
 nari niketan main sudhaar ke liye di gai sifarish main bhi ayog ne doctoron kii sankhya badhaane kii baat kahi thi
 The commission found during inspection that the toilets made here are very dirty
 vahaan badboo se bura haal tha
 There was only one employee for cleanliness
 hairaani kii baat yah he ki soshal welfare department ne bhi apane jawaab main yah baat sweekaar kii he ki bager home va aashaa jyoti home main ek hi safaikarmi he
 It is highly condemnable that the department is also aware that there is a shortage of staff for cleanliness, but still the shortage of staff has not been met
 ayog ne apni sifarish main safaikarmi staff kii kami ko jald se jald dur karne ke liye kaha he
 The Commission has found that there is also a shortage of water in this home, due to which the women living there are not able to take bath properly and have become allergic
 ayog kaa maananaa he ki department yadi samay-samay par in home kaa nirikshan karegaa to is tarah kii choti-choti samasyaayein apane aap dur ho jaaengi
 The response from the Social Welfare Department after the Commission's inspection states that FRRO is not willing to run Detention Center (bagger Home)
 iske liye vibhaag ne kai baar likhaa bhi he ki uske karmchaaree videshi nagarikon ko rakhane main aksham hai
 Therefore, FRRO should create a detention center separately and keep foreign women in it
 lekin 2014 main up rajyapal kii adhyakshata main ek baithak hui thi jisamen yah nirnay liya gaya tha ki epararo kii ore se jo teen ditension centre chalaaye ja rahe hai unhen chalaane kii jimmedaari soshal welfare department kii hogi
 The Commission also believes that the Social Welfare Department should run a Detention Center
 ayog ne apane nirikshan or jaanch ke baad paaya bager home kii monitering na ke baraabar hoti he
 In 2014, the then Social Welfare Secretary Satbir Bedi and in 2015 the director of the same department last visited this home
 ayog kaa maananaa he ki vibhaag ke sabase senior officer ko maheene main ek baar in jagahon kaa daura karnaa chahie
 Also, the need to install CCTV equipment for monitoring them has also been mentioned
 kya rajasthan main yaa bharat main kahin bhi sirf jaj, magistrate, afasar, saasand or vidhayakon ke kilaaf juthi exiaar hoti he? agar in prabhaavshaalee logon ke khilaaf juthi exiaar hoti he to phir aam logon ke khilaaf kitni exiaar hoti hongi? aise main kisi sarkaar ko kya karnaa chahie? pehle aam logon kii raksha kerani chahie yaa phir afasaron kii? rajasthan sarkaar ne 23 aktubar ke rose vidhansabha main jo vidheyak pesh kiya he, use lekar is tarah ke sawaal ubharne lage hai
 If this bill is enacted, then a case will not be reported when a government is allowed to file an FIR
 agar vah 6 maheene main anumati nahin degi to kaaran bhi nahin bataaegi ki anumati kyon nahin di gai
 During this, you can understand who will get the benefit of delay
 aap chahen to yah bhi samaj sakate hai ki 180 din tak sarkaar exiaar kii anumati nahin degi
 So what can happen to the journalist who is carrying the news
 6 maheene ke dauraan sabooton ko gaayab kar diya jayega or khabar likhane vaale kaa intazaam ho jayega
 Do you want this somvaar ko jab yah vidheyak pesh hua to sadan ke baahar congress ke netaa munh par kaali pattee baandh kar pradarshan kar rahe the
 Congress leader Sachin Pilot has said that his leaders have also protested within the House
 payalat kaa kahana he ki ye kaala kanoon he or sarkaar taanaashaahee karnaa chaahati he
 The Congress was also stirred when a section of the media started raising questions about the proposed bill
 pichley maheene jab rajasthan sarkaar adhyadesh le ai to vipaksh 7 sitambar se lekar 20 aktubar tak kahaan tha
 bjp's Bhavani Singh Rajawat, Manakchand Surana and Ghanshyam Tiwari have opposed its proposals
 ghanashyam tiwadi to sadan se hi vakout kar gaye
 Ghanshyam Tiwari has challenged the government's claim that this amendment is being brought to wear armor to honest officers
 tiwadi ne kaha he ki kya sarkaar ke paas koi suchi he ki koun se adhikari eemaandaar hai or koun se nahin hai
 While presenting the bill, Home Minister Gulabchand Kataria has said that he is ready to amend if needed
 18 disambar, 2013 ko lokapal kanoon paas hua tha
 The Lokpal has not been appointed till October 24, 2017
 varna kisi adhikari yaa jaj ke khilaaf bhrashtachar kii shikaayat lekar lokapal ke paas jane kii suvidha hoti
 The Lokpal issue has been cleverly disappeared
 ab to karpshan ke maamle main exiaar ke liye rajasthan sarkaar anumati kaa adhikaar apane paas rakhana chaahati he
 If this bill is enacted, then what rights will be left to the Lokayukta in Rajasthan, is the Lokayukta also being neutralized through this law? Not only this, unless the government gives permission, the court also cannot order an FIR
 kya sarkaar ko court par bharosa nahin rahaa? artiai se milane vaali soochna kaa kya matlab rah jayega, pehle aap usee sarkaar se bhrashtachar kii soochna hasil kiijie, phir aap usee sarkaar ke paas jaaiye ki falaan adhikari ke khilaaf exiaar kii anumati mil sakati he
 It is also possible that the government will allow the case to be filed in the case of opposition, and will not allow it in the case of its mlas
 rajasthan sarkaar ne 21 aktubar ko press reelij jari kar safai di he
 The state government has said in its press release - because in Section 156 (3), through the court, most of the police stations in the police stations have filed cases against any eminent and biggest public servant due to malpractices, degrading and personal enmity
 Go and news is published against him in the media
 isse locasevak kii chhavi to dhoomil ho hi jaati he or use maansik santaap tathaa juthi badanaami kaa saamana bhi karnaa padataa he
 Later most such cases are found to be false
 udhaaharan ke taur par 2013 se 2017 ke bich jitne bhi mukademe 156(3) main darj hue hai unamem se kareeb 73 pratishat mukademon main police ne effaar ( final report) lagaai
 That is, during this period about 73 percent of the people had to face false infamy
 unhen doshi na hote hue bhi na keval maansik santaap jhelana padaa balki nyaayalay or karypalika kaa samay bhi jaaya hua
 Were the 73 percent of those who faced false slander, only mlas, mps, officers, magistrates and judges? The government should have also mentioned how common people are in this 73 percent
 sarkaar ke paas yah aankada kahaan se aayaa, isaki koi jaankaree nahin di gai he
 There is no information about which agency the government will have before the FIR
 phir police ke hone kaa kya matlab rah jaataa he
 Is a separate police agency going to be formed for judges, magistrates, officers and mps? Do not forget that the government agencies also lodge false cases against citizens, in the case of terror, 20-20 years young people have been implicated in fake cases and kept in jail
 is vidheyak main is baat kaa zikr kyon nahin he
 Why hasn't the government made a provision of two years of jail against officers who have filed false cases
 jhuthe mukademe kya parshad, mukhiya, jila parishad ke sadasyon ke khilaaf nahin hote hai, unako kyon chhod diya he? According to the 2015 statistics of the National Crime Research Branch Bureau, in 2015, 40 lakh, 10 thousand, 195 cases were registered under IPC
 inamen se 1 lakh, 13 hazaar, 388 maamle jhuthe paae gaye
 Not even 3 percent of the total FIR
 rajasthan sarkaar ko 73 fisadi kahaan se aankada mila, kya rajasthan main juthi exiaar hi darj hoti hai
 By the way, the press release of the Rajasthan government has been very cleverly written
 kahin bhi saaf-saaf nahin likhaa he ki 73 fisadi juthi exiaar darj hui hai
 Let's look at the graphics one more time
 agar aap sarkaar kii baton ko ghayan se na dekhen to kab sadak ke bich main braker aa jayega pataa hi nahin chalegaa or aapkaa sar car kii chat se takaraa jayega
 The press release stated that all the cases between 2013 and 2017 have been filed in 156 (3)
 unamem se kareeb 73 pratishat mukademon main police ne effaar (final report) lagaai
 The press release did not say that the police found 73 percent of the firs in the final report to be false
 yah kaha he ki 73 fisadi maamalon main antim report pesh kar di
 During this period, about 73 per cent of the people faced false slander
 unhen doshi na hote hue bhi na keval maansik santaap jhelana padaa
 Not only 73, 100 percent people have to face mental anguish due to FIR
 is bayaan se aisa lagata he ki 27 fisadi aise bhi hai jo exiaar se khush hote hai, unhen kisi prakaar kii pareshaani nahin hoti he
 This bill is also against the media
 jab tak sarkaar exiaar kii anumati nahin degi, media apni report main us adhikari, saansad yaa vidhayak kaa naam nahin le saktaa he
 Even two years in jail if i tell your identity
 pratham soochna report main kahin nahin likhaa he ki jo likhaa gaya he vah saboot he yaa faisla he
 This only means that the police should start an investigation in this matter immediately
 editors gild ne kaha he ki pratyaksh rup se ye nyaaypalika or naukarshahi ko jhuthe exiar se bachaane ke liye laayaa gaya
 In reality, it is a deadly weapon to harass the media, hide the wrongdoings of bureaucrats and curb the freedom of the press given by the Constitution
 editors gild chahta he ki rajasthan sarkaar turant adhyadesh waapas le or ise kaanoon banane se parhez kare
 Instead of taking strict steps against fake and false cases, the Rajasthan government has brought an ordinance that wants to silence the messenger
 editors gild ne yah bhi kaha ki rajasthan sarkaar kaa ye qadam kathor he or ye janhit kii khabar dene vaale patrakaron ko giraftaar karne tak kii khuli chhot detaa he
 Parliament created a new CRPC code in 1970, stating that a person who is a judge or magistrate or public servant cannot be removed without the approval of the government if he is found to be accused of being involved in a crime
 Then the court will not take cognizance against him without sanction
 yahi nahin vidheyak laane se pehle rajasthan sarkaar ne raashtrapati se adhyadesh kaa anumodan liya he
 The ordinance has also been introduced and it has been introduced in the Legislative Assembly to make laws
 pipuls union for civil liberties ne is vidheyak ko rajasthan hycourt main chunauti dene kaa elaan kiya he
 Rajasthan's lawyer AK Jain has filed a petition in the court against this bill
 maan lijie ki yah vidheyak bagair sanshodhan ke paas ho jaataa he
 After that how would reporting a scam
 kya reporter khabar lekar 180 din baithegaa, sarkaar ke paas jayega ki aap exiaar anumati dijie to ham chhaapen
 Please, hang up for 180 days so that the scamster cleans both us and the evidence
 phir bhi reporting kaise hogi, iskaa ek namoona pesh karata hum
 It is not a sample, but the entire fabric is a police station
 reporter ko artiai se hasil jaankaree se pataa chalata he ki ek vibhaag main ek adhikari ne 200 karod kaa gaban kiya he
 Now how will he write the news because even two years jail is to be avoided
 priy darshak or priyatam pathak, aaiye aap or ham donon milakar jhil ke kinare chalate hai or apni apni kalpanaaon ke istemaal se is khabar ko samajhane kaa prayaas karte hai
 The alleged embezzlement of 200 crores of rupees is related to the MP who was sitting next to that minister who came from Delhi and was not drinking tea, that close officer of the same MP said the rules at his behest Broke and gave a contract of 200 crores to a contractor close to that MLA
 ham itnaa jaanate hai ki jahaan ghotaalaa hua he, wo vibhaag ek sarkari imaarat main he
 Which consists of a hundred rooms and in which a thousand employees sit
 inhen main se ek kamare main wo vaala afasar baithta he jisane 200 karod kaa kathith rup se ghotaalaa kiya he
 His relatives are also allegedly involved in this scam, but if we tell the name, there will be 2 years in jail
 kis shahar main, kis maamle main, kis chiz kaa ghotaalaa hua he agar ham itnaa bhi bataa denge to to pataa chal jayega ki wo vibhaag koun sa he, us vibhaag kaa sachiv koun he, us vibhaag kaa mantri koun he, or hamen do saal kii jail ho jaaegi
 If you do not know, then we are telling that the matter is of a department located in the north direction from Jaipur, the name is A, the name of the secretary is b and the name of the minister is the amount of scam
 us imaarat sthit us vibhaag ke us afasar ne us maamle main 200 karod kaa kathith rup se wo vaala ghotaalaa kiya he, jo vaala bihar main ho chukaa he
 However, in which building, in which department, in which case, in which case, in which case, that scam of 200 crores has been done, you will have to wait for 6 months to know, as long as the government will not allow the FIR to be done after its investigation , We cannot tell more than this
 isiilie thodaa likhaa he zyaada samajhnaa
 If the FIR is not approved, then understand that the officer of that department located in that building has not done a scam of 200 crores in that case
 kya aisa nahin ho saktaa ki sarkarein itnaa sab karne ke bajaae ek kanoon paas kar den ki press main sirf lori chhapegi
 Anchor lullabies will be played on TV
 bijepi ke paas sampurna bahumat he, jis tarah se vah adhyadesh le ai usee tarah se vah ise paas bhi kara sakati he
 Now it used to be that if the police could not file an FIR, then someone would go to court and get orders and the investigation would start
 magar yah vidheyak paas hua to court se bhi anumati nahin milegi
 It is sure that if the state government does not give the award in six months, then it will be considered that the permission has been granted, not only this, it is also written in the bill that the government will not have to give any reason for its decision
 saansad or vidhayak kaa naam he, mukhyamantri kaa nahin he, to kya mukhyamantri ke khilaaf epa ai aar ho sakati he yaa mukhyamantri bhi vidhayak hote hai yaa hoti hai to unke khilaaf bhi epa ai aar ke liye unheen se manzuri leni hogi
 In Uttar Pradesh, one such case is pending in the Allahabad court regarding Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath
 is bare main ham march 2017 kii scrol dot in kii ek report kaa sahaara le rahe hai jisamen bataaya gaya he ki akhilesh sarkaar ne yogi adityanath ke khilaaf mukadmaa chalaane kii anumati nahin di
 If the Home Ministry is also under Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, will he allow prosecution against him? The comments maamla 2007 kaa he, saansad ke taur par un par kathith rup se hinsa or nafrat bhadakaane kaa aarope he
 Gorakhpur journalist Parvez Parvaz had filed an FIR in which Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath was also named but the government did not allow the prosecution
 10 july, 2015 se yah maamla anumati kaa intazaar kar rahaa he
 The final decision has not been made even in seven years
 jabaki krime branch ne jaanch puri kar lee he
 Defending the government's decision in the court, the chief secretary said that the CD which Parvez had submitted was tampered with
 maamla adaalat main he isliye zyaada tippanee karnaa uchit nahin hoga
 Dainik Jagran has written that a hearing took place in the case on 23 October
 godi media vaise hi bhajan-bhojan main laga hua he ab kanoon hi ban jayega to sabko aaraam ho jayega ki report hi nahin kerani he varna jail ho jaaegi lekin aap aam aadmi kii nigaah se sochie, jhuthe mukademe aapke khilaaf honge to unka kya hoga, kya aapaki pareshaani kisi saansad yaa vidhayak yaa afasar se kam he, unka cese ladane ke liye to sarkaar ke paas vakeelon kii fouj hoti he, aapke paas kya hota he
 There is no other debt, worship and worship
 press kii azaadi par hamalaa nahin he to kya he
 If a false FIR is being written, then its solution should be to make it difficult to write an FIR against two people and leave the rest on their condition
 aap chahen to yah bhi samaj sakate hai ki 180 din tak sarkaar exiaar kii anumati nahin degi
 So what can happen to the journalist who is carrying the news
 6 maheene ke dauraan sabooton ko gaayab kar diya jayega or khabar likhane vaale kaa intazaam ho jayega
 Do you want this somvaar ko jab yah vidheyak pesh hua to sadan ke baahar congress ke netaa munh par kaali pattee baandh kar pradarshan kar rahe the
 Congress leader Sachin Pilot has said that his leaders have also protested within the House
 payalat kaa kahana he ki ye kaala kanoon he or sarkaar taanaashaahee karnaa chaahati he
 The Congress was also stirred when a section of the media started raising questions about the proposed bill
 pichley maheene jab rajasthan sarkaar adhyadesh le ai to vipaksh 7 sitambar se lekar 20 aktubar tak kahaan tha
 bjp's Bhavani Singh Rajawat, Manakchand Surana and Ghanshyam Tiwari have opposed its proposals
 ghanashyam tiwadi to sadan se hi vakout kar gaye
 Ghanshyam Tiwari has challenged the government's claim that this amendment is being brought to wear armor to honest officers
 tiwadi ne kaha he ki kya sarkaar ke paas koi suchi he ki koun se adhikari eemaandaar hai or koun se nahin hai
 While presenting the bill, Home Minister Gulabchand Kataria has said that he is ready to amend if needed
 18 disambar, 2013 ko lokapal kanoon paas hua tha
 The Lokpal has not been appointed till October 24, 2017
 varna kisi adhikari yaa jaj ke khilaaf bhrashtachar kii shikaayat lekar lokapal ke paas jane kii suvidha hoti
 The Lokpal issue has been cleverly disappeared
 ab to karpshan ke maamle main exiaar ke liye rajasthan sarkaar anumati kaa adhikaar apane paas rakhana chaahati he
 If this bill is enacted, then what rights will be left to the Lokayukta in Rajasthan, is the Lokayukta also being neutralized through this law? Not only this, unless the government gives permission, the court also cannot order an FIR
 kya sarkaar ko court par bharosa nahin rahaa? artiai se milane vaali soochna kaa kya matlab rah jayega, pehle aap usee sarkaar se bhrashtachar kii soochna hasil kiijie, phir aap usee sarkaar ke paas jaaiye ki falaan adhikari ke khilaaf exiaar kii anumati mil sakati he
 It is also possible that the government will allow the case to be filed in the case of opposition, and will not allow it in the case of its mlas
 rajasthan sarkaar ne 21 aktubar ko press reelij jari kar safai di he
 The state government has said in its press release - because in Section 156 (3), through the court, most of the police stations in the police stations have filed cases against any eminent and biggest public servant due to malpractices, degrading and personal enmity
 Go and news is published against him in the media
 isse locasevak kii chhavi to dhoomil ho hi jaati he or use maansik santaap tathaa juthi badanaami kaa saamana bhi karnaa padataa he
 Later most such cases are found to be false
 udhaaharan ke taur par 2013 se 2017 ke bich jitne bhi mukademe 156(3) main darj hue hai unamem se kareeb 73 pratishat mukademon main police ne effaar ( final report) lagaai
 That is, during this period about 73 percent of the people had to face false infamy
 unhen doshi na hote hue bhi na keval maansik santaap jhelana padaa balki nyaayalay or karypalika kaa samay bhi jaaya hua
 Were the 73 percent of those who faced false slander, only mlas, mps, officers, magistrates and judges? The government should have also mentioned how common people are in this 73 percent
 sarkaar ke paas yah aankada kahaan se aayaa, isaki koi jaankaree nahin di gai he
 There is no information about which agency the government will have before the FIR
 phir police ke hone kaa kya matlab rah jaataa he
 Is a separate police agency going to be formed for judges, magistrates, officers and mps? Do not forget that the government agencies also lodge false cases against citizens, in the case of terror, 20-20 years young people have been implicated in fake cases and kept in jail
 is vidheyak main is baat kaa zikr kyon nahin he
 Why hasn't the government made a provision of two years of jail against officers who have filed false cases
 jhuthe mukademe kya parshad, mukhiya, jila parishad ke sadasyon ke khilaaf nahin hote hai, unako kyon chhod diya he? According to the 2015 statistics of the National Crime Research Branch Bureau, in 2015, 40 lakh, 10 thousand, 195 cases were registered under IPC
 inamen se 1 lakh, 13 hazaar, 388 maamle jhuthe paae gaye
 Not even 3 percent of the total FIR
 rajasthan sarkaar ko 73 fisadi kahaan se aankada mila, kya rajasthan main juthi exiaar hi darj hoti hai
 By the way, the press release of the Rajasthan government has been very cleverly written
 kahin bhi saaf-saaf nahin likhaa he ki 73 fisadi juthi exiaar darj hui hai
 Let's look at the graphics one more time
 agar aap sarkaar kii baton ko ghayan se na dekhen to kab sadak ke bich main braker aa jayega pataa hi nahin chalegaa or aapkaa sar car kii chat se takaraa jayega
 The press release stated that all the cases between 2013 and 2017 have been filed in 156 (3)
 unamem se kareeb 73 pratishat mukademon main police ne effaar (final report) lagaai
 The press release did not say that the police found 73 percent of the firs in the final report to be false
 yah kaha he ki 73 fisadi maamalon main antim report pesh kar di
 During this period, about 73 per cent of the people faced false slander
 unhen doshi na hote hue bhi na keval maansik santaap jhelana padaa
 Not only 73, 100 percent people have to face mental anguish due to FIR
 is bayaan se aisa lagata he ki 27 fisadi aise bhi hai jo exiaar se khush hote hai, unhen kisi prakaar kii pareshaani nahin hoti he
 This bill is also against the media
 jab tak sarkaar exiaar kii anumati nahin degi, media apni report main us adhikari, saansad yaa vidhayak kaa naam nahin le saktaa he

 kis shahar main, kis maamle main, kis chiz kaa ghotaalaa hua he agar ham itnaa bhi bataa denge to to pataa chal jayega ki wo vibhaag koun sa he, us vibhaag kaa sachiv koun he, us vibhaag kaa mantri koun he, or hamen do saal kii jail ho jaaegi
 If you do not know, then we are telling that the matter is of a department located in the north direction from Jaipur, the name is A, the name of the secretary is b and the name of the minister is the amount of scam
 us imaarat sthit us vibhaag ke us afasar ne us maamle main 200 karod kaa kathith rup se wo vaala ghotaalaa kiya he, jo vaala bihar main ho chukaa he
 However, in which building, in which department, in which case, in which case, in which case, that scam of 200 crores has been done, you will have to wait for 6 months to know, as long as the government will not allow the FIR to be done after its investigation , We cannot tell more than this
 isiilie thodaa likhaa he zyaada samajhnaa
 If the FIR is not approved, then understand that the officer of that department located in that building has not done a scam of 200 crores in that case
 kya aisa nahin ho saktaa ki sarkarein itnaa sab karne ke bajaae ek kanoon paas kar den ki press main sirf lori chhapegi
 Anchor lullabies will be played on TV
 bijepi ke paas sampurna bahumat he, jis tarah se vah adhyadesh le ai usee tarah se vah ise paas bhi kara sakati he
 Now it used to be that if the police could not file an FIR, then someone would go to court and get orders and the investigation would start
 magar yah vidheyak paas hua to court se bhi anumati nahin milegi
 It is sure that if the state government does not give the award in six months, then it will be considered that the permission has been granted, not only this, it is also written in the bill that the government will not have to give any reason for its decision
 saansad or vidhayak kaa naam he, mukhyamantri kaa nahin he, to kya mukhyamantri ke khilaaf epa ai aar ho sakati he yaa mukhyamantri bhi vidhayak hote hai yaa hoti hai to unke khilaaf bhi epa ai aar ke liye unheen se manzuri leni hogi
 In Uttar Pradesh, one such case is pending in the Allahabad court regarding Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath
 is bare main ham march 2017 kii scrol dot in kii ek report kaa sahaara le rahe hai jisamen bataaya gaya he ki akhilesh sarkaar ne yogi adityanath ke khilaaf mukadmaa chalaane kii anumati nahin di
 If the Home Ministry is also under Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, will he allow prosecution against him? The comments maamla 2007 kaa he, saansad ke taur par un par kathith rup se hinsa or nafrat bhadakaane kaa aarope he
 Gorakhpur journalist Parvez Parvaz had filed an FIR in which Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath was also named but the government did not allow the prosecution
 10 july, 2015 se yah maamla anumati kaa intazaar kar rahaa he
 The final decision has not been made even in seven years
 jabaki krime branch ne jaanch puri kar lee he
 Defending the government's decision in the court, the chief secretary said that the CD which Parvez had submitted was tampered with
 maamla adaalat main he isliye zyaada tippanee karnaa uchit nahin hoga
 Dainik Jagran has written that a hearing took place in the case on 23 October
 godi media vaise hi bhajan-bhojan main laga hua he ab kanoon hi ban jayega to sabko aaraam ho jayega ki report hi nahin kerani he varna jail ho jaaegi lekin aap aam aadmi kii nigaah se sochie, jhuthe mukademe aapke khilaaf honge to unka kya hoga, kya aapaki pareshaani kisi saansad yaa vidhayak yaa afasar se kam he, unka cese ladane ke liye to sarkaar ke paas vakeelon kii fouj hoti he, aapke paas kya hota he
 There is no other debt, worship and worship
 press kii azaadi par hamalaa nahin he to kya he
 If a false FIR is being written, then its solution should be to make it difficult to write an FIR against two people and leave the rest on their condition
 18 disambar, 2013 ko lokapal kanoon paas hua tha
 The Lokpal has not been appointed till October 24, 2017
 varna kisi adhikari yaa jaj ke khilaaf bhrashtachar kii shikaayat lekar lokapal ke paas jane kii suvidha hoti
 The Lokpal issue has been cleverly disappeared
 ab to karpshan ke maamle main exiaar ke liye rajasthan sarkaar anumati kaa adhikaar apane paas rakhana chaahati he
 If this bill is enacted, then what rights will be left to the Lokayukta in Rajasthan, is the Lokayukta also being neutralized through this law? Not only this, unless the government gives permission, the court also cannot order an FIR
 kya sarkaar ko court par bharosa nahin rahaa? artiai se milane vaali soochna kaa kya matlab rah jayega, pehle aap usee sarkaar se bhrashtachar kii soochna hasil kiijie, phir aap usee sarkaar ke paas jaaiye ki falaan adhikari ke khilaaf exiaar kii anumati mil sakati he
 It is also possible that the government will allow the case to be filed in the case of opposition, and will not allow it in the case of its mlas
 rajasthan sarkaar ne 21 aktubar ko press reelij jari kar safai di he
 The state government has said in its press release - because in Section 156 (3), through the court, most of the police stations in the police stations have filed cases against any eminent and biggest public servant due to malpractices, degrading and personal enmity
 Go and news is published against him in the media
 isse locasevak kii chhavi to dhoomil ho hi jaati he or use maansik santaap tathaa juthi badanaami kaa saamana bhi karnaa padataa he
 Later most such cases are found to be false
 udhaaharan ke taur par 2013 se 2017 ke bich jitne bhi mukademe 156(3) main darj hue hai unamem se kareeb 73 pratishat mukademon main police ne effaar ( final report) lagaai
 That is, during this period about 73 percent of the people had to face false infamy 
 unhen doshi na hote hue bhi na keval maansik santaap jhelana padaa balki nyaayalay or karypalika kaa samay bhi jaaya hua
 Were the 73 percent of those who faced false slander, only mlas, mps, officers, magistrates and judges? The government should have also mentioned how common people are in this 73 percent
 sarkaar ke paas yah aankada kahaan se aayaa, isaki koi jaankaree nahin di gai he
 There is no information about which agency the government will have before the FIR
 phir police ke hone kaa kya matlab rah jaataa he
 Is a separate police agency going to be formed for judges, magistrates, officers and mps? Do not forget that the government agencies also lodge false cases against citizens, in the case of terror, 20-20 years young people have been implicated in fake cases and kept in jail
 is vidheyak main is baat kaa zikr kyon nahin he
 Why hasn't the government made a provision of two years of jail against officers who have filed false cases
 jhuthe mukademe kya parshad, mukhiya, jila parishad ke sadasyon ke khilaaf nahin hote hai, unako kyon chhod diya he? According to the 2015 statistics of the National Crime Research Branch Bureau, in 2015, 40 lakh, 10 thousand, 195 cases were registered under IPC
 inamen se 1 lakh, 13 hazaar, 388 maamle jhuthe paae gaye
 Not even 3 percent of the total FIR
 rajasthan sarkaar ko 73 fisadi kahaan se aankada mila, kya rajasthan main juthi exiaar hi darj hoti hai
 By the way, the press release of the Rajasthan government has been very cleverly written
 kahin bhi saaf-saaf nahin likhaa he ki 73 fisadi juthi exiaar darj hui hai
 Let's look at the graphics one more time
 agar aap sarkaar kii baton ko ghayan se na dekhen to kab sadak ke bich main braker aa jayega pataa hi nahin chalegaa or aapkaa sar car kii chat se takaraa jayega
 The press release stated that all the cases between 2013 and 2017 have been filed in 156 (3)
 unamem se kareeb 73 pratishat mukademon main police ne effaar (final report) lagaai
 The press release did not say that the police found 73 percent of the firs in the final report to be false
 yah kaha he ki 73 fisadi maamalon main antim report pesh kar di
 During this period, about 73 per cent of the people faced false slander
 unhen doshi na hote hue bhi na keval maansik santaap jhelana padaa
 Not only 73, 100 percent people have to face mental anguish due to FIR
 is bayaan se aisa lagata he ki 27 fisadi aise bhi hai jo exiaar se khush hote hai, unhen kisi prakaar kii pareshaani nahin hoti he
 This bill is also against the media
 jab tak sarkaar exiaar kii anumati nahin degi, media apni report main us adhikari, saansad yaa vidhayak kaa naam nahin le saktaa he
 Even two years in jail if i tell your identity
 pratham soochna report main kahin nahin likhaa he ki jo likhaa gaya he vah saboot he yaa faisla he
 This only means that the police should start an investigation in this matter immediately
 editors gild ne kaha he ki pratyaksh rup se ye nyaaypalika or naukarshahi ko jhuthe exiar se bachaane ke liye laayaa gaya
 In reality, it is a deadly weapon to harass the media, hide the wrongdoings of bureaucrats and curb the freedom of the press given by the Constitution
 editors gild chahta he ki rajasthan sarkaar turant adhyadesh waapas le or ise kaanoon banane se parhez kare
 Instead of taking strict steps against fake and false cases, the Rajasthan government has brought an ordinance that wants to silence the messenger
 editors gild ne yah bhi kaha ki rajasthan sarkaar kaa ye qadam kathor he or ye janhit kii khabar dene vaale patrakaron ko giraftaar karne tak kii khuli chhot detaa he
 Parliament created a new CRPC code in 1970, stating that a person who is a judge or magistrate or public servant cannot be removed without the approval of the government if he is found to be accused of being involved in a crime
 Then the court will not take cognizance against him without sanction
 yahi nahin vidheyak laane se pehle rajasthan sarkaar ne raashtrapati se adhyadesh kaa anumodan liya he
 The ordinance has also been introduced and it has been introduced in the Legislative Assembly to make laws
 pipuls union for civil liberties ne is vidheyak ko rajasthan hycourt main chunauti dene kaa elaan kiya he
 Rajasthan's lawyer AK Jain has filed a petition in the court against this bill
 maan lijie ki yah vidheyak bagair sanshodhan ke paas ho jaataa he
 After that how would reporting a scam
 kya reporter khabar lekar 180 din baithegaa, sarkaar ke paas jayega ki aap exiaar anumati dijie to ham chhaapen
 Please, hang up for 180 days so that the scamster cleans both us and the evidence
 phir bhi reporting kaise hogi, iskaa ek namoona pesh karata hum
 It is not a sample, but the entire fabric is a police station
 reporter ko artiai se hasil jaankaree se pataa chalata he ki ek vibhaag main ek adhikari ne 200 karod kaa gaban kiya he
 Now how will he write the news because even two years jail is to be avoided
 priy darshak or priyatam pathak, aaiye aap or ham donon milakar jhil ke kinare chalate hai or apni apni kalpanaaon ke istemaal se is khabar ko samajhane kaa prayaas karte hai
 The alleged embezzlement of 200 crores of rupees is related to the MP who was sitting next to that minister who came from Delhi and was not drinking tea, that close officer of the same MP said the rules at his behest Broke and gave a contract of 200 crores to a contractor close to that MLA
 ham itnaa jaanate hai ki jahaan ghotaalaa hua he, wo vibhaag ek sarkari imaarat main he
 Which consists of a hundred rooms and in which a thousand employees sit

 The press release did not say that the police found 73 percent of the firs in the final report to be false
 yah kaha he ki 73 fisadi maamalon main antim report pesh kar di
 During this period, about 73 per cent of the people faced false slander
 unhen doshi na hote hue bhi na keval maansik santaap jhelana padaa
 Not only 73, 100 percent people have to face mental anguish due to FIR
 is bayaan se aisa lagata he ki 27 fisadi aise bhi hai jo exiaar se khush hote hai, unhen kisi prakaar kii pareshaani nahin hoti he
 This bill is also against the media
 jab tak sarkaar exiaar kii anumati nahin degi, media apni report main us adhikari, saansad yaa vidhayak kaa naam nahin le saktaa he
 Even two years in jail if i tell your identity
 pratham soochna report main kahin nahin likhaa he ki jo likhaa gaya he vah saboot he yaa faisla he
 This only means that the police should start an investigation in this matter immediately
 editors gild ne kaha he ki pratyaksh rup se ye nyaaypalika or naukarshahi ko jhuthe exiar se bachaane ke liye laayaa gaya
 In reality, it is a deadly weapon to harass the media, hide the wrongdoings of bureaucrats and curb the freedom of the press given by the Constitution
 editors gild chahta he ki rajasthan sarkaar turant adhyadesh waapas le or ise kaanoon banane se parhez kare
 Instead of taking strict steps against fake and false cases, the Rajasthan government has brought an ordinance that wants to silence the messenger
 editors gild ne yah bhi kaha ki rajasthan sarkaar kaa ye qadam kathor he or ye janhit kii khabar dene vaale patrakaron ko giraftaar karne tak kii khuli chhot detaa he
 Parliament created a new CRPC code in 1970, stating that a person who is a judge or magistrate or public servant cannot be removed without the approval of the government if he is found to be accused of being involved in a crime
 Then the court will not take cognizance against him without sanction
 yahi nahin vidheyak laane se pehle rajasthan sarkaar ne raashtrapati se adhyadesh kaa anumodan liya he
 The ordinance has also been introduced and it has been introduced in the Legislative Assembly to make laws
 pipuls union for civil liberties ne is vidheyak ko rajasthan hycourt main chunauti dene kaa elaan kiya he
 Rajasthan's lawyer AK Jain has filed a petition in the court against this bill
 maan lijie ki yah vidheyak bagair sanshodhan ke paas ho jaataa he
 After that how would reporting a scam
 kya reporter khabar lekar 180 din baithegaa, sarkaar ke paas jayega ki aap exiaar anumati dijie to ham chhaapen
 Please, hang up for 180 days so that the scamster cleans both us and the evidence
 phir bhi reporting kaise hogi, iskaa ek namoona pesh karata hum
 It is not a sample, but the entire fabric is a police station
 reporter ko artiai se hasil jaankaree se pataa chalata he ki ek vibhaag main ek adhikari ne 200 karod kaa gaban kiya he
 Now how will he write the news because even two years jail is to be avoided
 priy darshak or priyatam pathak, aaiye aap or ham donon milakar jhil ke kinare chalate hai or apni apni kalpanaaon ke istemaal se is khabar ko samajhane kaa prayaas karte hai
 The alleged embezzlement of 200 crores of rupees is related to the MP who was sitting next to that minister who came from Delhi and was not drinking tea, that close officer of the same MP said the rules at his behest Broke and gave a contract of 200 crores to a contractor close to that MLA
 ham itnaa jaanate hai ki jahaan ghotaalaa hua he, wo vibhaag ek sarkari imaarat main he
 Which consists of a hundred rooms and in which a thousand employees sit
 inhen main se ek kamare main wo vaala afasar baithta he jisane 200 karod kaa kathith rup se ghotaalaa kiya he
 His relatives are also allegedly involved in this scam, but if we tell the name, there will be 2 years in jail
 kis shahar main, kis maamle main, kis chiz kaa ghotaalaa hua he agar ham itnaa bhi bataa denge to to pataa chal jayega ki wo vibhaag koun sa he, us vibhaag kaa sachiv koun he, us vibhaag kaa mantri koun he, or hamen do saal kii jail ho jaaegi
 If you do not know, then we are telling that the matter is of a department located in the north direction from Jaipur, the name is A, the name of the secretary is b and the name of the minister is the amount of scam
 us imaarat sthit us vibhaag ke us afasar ne us maamle main 200 karod kaa kathith rup se wo vaala ghotaalaa kiya he, jo vaala bihar main ho chukaa he
 However, in which building, in which department, in which case, in which case, in which case, that scam of 200 crores has been done, you will have to wait for 6 months to know, as long as the government will not allow the FIR to be done after its investigation , We cannot tell more than this
 isiilie thodaa likhaa he zyaada samajhnaa
 If the FIR is not approved, then understand that the officer of that department located in that building has not done a scam of 200 crores in that case
 kya aisa nahin ho saktaa ki sarkarein itnaa sab karne ke bajaae ek kanoon paas kar den ki press main sirf lori chhapegi
 Anchor lullabies will be played on TV
 bijepi ke paas sampurna bahumat he, jis tarah se vah adhyadesh le ai usee tarah se vah ise paas bhi kara sakati he
 Now it used to be that if the police could not file an FIR, then someone would go to court and get orders and the investigation would start
 magar yah vidheyak paas hua to court se bhi anumati nahin milegi
 It is sure that if the state government does not give the award in six months, then it will be considered that the permission has been granted, not only this, it is also written in the bill that the government will not have to give any reason for its decision
 saansad or vidhayak kaa naam he, mukhyamantri kaa nahin he, to kya mukhyamantri ke khilaaf epa ai aar ho sakati he yaa mukhyamantri bhi vidhayak hote hai yaa hoti hai to unke khilaaf bhi epa ai aar ke liye unheen se manzuri leni hogi
 In Uttar Pradesh, one such case is pending in the Allahabad court regarding Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath
 is bare main ham march 2017 kii scrol dot in kii ek report kaa sahaara le rahe hai jisamen bataaya gaya he ki akhilesh sarkaar ne yogi adityanath ke khilaaf mukadmaa chalaane kii anumati nahin di
 If the Home Ministry is also under Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, will he allow prosecution against him? The comments maamla 2007 kaa he, saansad ke taur par un par kathith rup se hinsa or nafrat bhadakaane kaa aarope he
 Gorakhpur journalist Parvez Parvaz had filed an FIR in which Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath was also named but the government did not allow the prosecution
 10 july, 2015 se yah maamla anumati kaa intazaar kar rahaa he
 The final decision has not been made even in seven years
 jabaki krime branch ne jaanch puri kar lee he
 Defending the government's decision in the court, the chief secretary said that the CD which Parvez had submitted was tampered with
 maamla adaalat main he isliye zyaada tippanee karnaa uchit nahin hoga
 Dainik Jagran has written that a hearing took place in the case on 23 October
 godi media vaise hi bhajan-bhojan main laga hua he ab kanoon hi ban jayega to sabko aaraam ho jayega ki report hi nahin kerani he varna jail ho jaaegi lekin aap aam aadmi kii nigaah se sochie, jhuthe mukademe aapke khilaaf honge to unka kya hoga, kya aapaki pareshaani kisi saansad yaa vidhayak yaa afasar se kam he, unka cese ladane ke liye to sarkaar ke paas vakeelon kii fouj hoti he, aapke paas kya hota he
 There is no other debt, worship and worship
 press kii azaadi par hamalaa nahin he to kya he
 If a false FIR is being written, then its solution should be to make it difficult to write an FIR against two people and leave the rest on their condition
 kya jin 73 pratishat logon ko juthi badanaami kaa saamana karnaa padaa, unamem sirf vidhayak, saansad, afasar, magistrate or jaj hi the? sarkaar ko yah bhi bataanaa chahie tha ki is 73 fisadi main kitne aam log hai
 No information has been given to the government where this data came from
 sarkaar ke paas exiaar se pehle jaanch karaane kii koun si agency hogi, isaki bhi koi soochna nahin he
 Then what is the point of being a policeman? kya jajon, magistrate, afasaron or saansadon ke liye alag police banane ja rahi he, unke liye alag se jaanch agency hogi? mat bhuuliye ki sarkaar kii agenciyaan bhi nagarikon ke khilaaf jhuthe mukademe darj kara detii hai, aatank ke maamle main 20-20 saal noujvaan farji mukademon main fansaa kar jail main rakhe gaye hai
 Why this bill is not mentioned in this bill
 sarkaar ne jhuthe mukademe daayar karaane vaale afasaron ke khilaaf do saal kii jail kaa praavdhaan kyon nahin rakhaa he
 False cases are not against the councilor, the head, the members of the Zilla Parishad, why have they been dropped? rashtriya aparaadh shodh shakha beuro ke 2015 ke aankade ke mutabik, 2015 main ipisi ke tahat darj 40 lakh, 10 hazaar, 195 maamle darj kiye gaye
 Of these, 1 lakh, 13 thousand, 388 cases were found to be false
 kul exiaar kaa 3 pratishat bhi nahin he
 From where did the Rajasthan government get 73 percent of the data, do only false firs are registered in Rajasthan
 vaise rajasthan sarkaar kii press release main bahut chaalaaki se likhaa gaya he
 It is not clearly written anywhere that 73 per cent false firs have been filed
 ek baar or graphics par nigaah daalate hai
 If you do not look at the government's words carefully, then when the breaker will come in the middle of the road, you will not know and your head will hit the roof of the car
 press relies main kaha gaya he ki 2013 se 2017 ke bich jitne bhi mukademe 156(3) main darj hue hai
 About 73 percent of them have frs (final report) by the police
 press relies main yah nahin kaha ki police ne final report main 73 fisadi exiaar ko jhootha paaya he
 It has said that in 73 percent of the cases, a final report has been submitted
 is avadhi main kareeb 73 fisadi logon ko juthi badanaami kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Despite being guilty, he not only suffered mental anguish
 exiaar hone se 73 hi nahin 100 fisadi logon ko maansik santaap jhelana padataa he
 From this statement, it seems that there are 27 percent who are happy with the FIR, they do not have any kind of trouble
 yah vidheyak media ke kilaaf bhi he
 Unless the government allows the FIR, the media cannot name the officer, MP or MLA in its report
 pahchaan bhi bataa degaa to do saal kii jail
 Nowhere is it written in the First Information Report that what is written is evidence or verdict
 itnaa hi matlab hota he ki police is maamle main tatkaal jaanch shuru kare
 The Editors Guild states that they were brought directly to protect the judiciary and bureaucracy from false firs
 asaliyat main ye media ko tang karne, naukarshahon ke galat kaamon ko chupaane or samvidhan dwaara di gai press kii azaadi par lagaam lagane kaa ghaatak hathiyaar he
 The Editors Guild wants the Rajasthan government to immediately withdraw the ordinance and abstain from enacting it
 farzi or jhuthe muqadamon ke kilaaf sakht qadam uthaa kar sazaa dene ke bajaae rajasthan sarkaar aisa adhyadesh laai he jo sandeshvahak ko chup karana chahta he
 The Editors Guild also said that this step of the Rajasthan government is harsh and it gives an open leeway to arrest the journalists who are reporting the public interest
 sansad ne 1970 main nai siarpisi code banaaya tha, isamen likhaa he ki koi vyakti jo ki jaj he yaa magistrate he yaa locasevak he, jise bina sarkaar kii manzuri ke nahin hataaya ja saktaa he, agar wo kisi aparaadh main shaamil paaya jane kaa aaropee banataa he tab bina manzuri ke adaalat uske khilaaf sangyaan nahin legi
 Not only this, before the introduction of the bill, the Rajasthan government has taken approval of the ordinance from the President
 adhyadesh laayaa bhi ja chukaa he or ise kanoon banane ke liye vidhaan sabha main pesh kiya gaya he
 The People's Union for Civil Liberties has announced to challenge this bill in the Rajasthan High Court
 is bill ke khilaaf rajasthan ke vakil ek ke jain ne adaalat main yachika daayar kii he
 Suppose this bill passes without amendment
 uske baad kisi ghotaale kii reporting kaise hogi
 Will the reporter sit with the news for 180 days, go to the government that if you give FIR permission, we will print
 pleez, aap 180 din tak lataka dijie taaki ghotalebaz hamen or saboot donon ko saaf kar de
 i still offer a sample of how reporting will occur
 namoona to nahin he balki puraa kaa puraa kapade kaa thaan he
 Information obtained from RTI to the reporter reveals that an officer in a department has misappropriated 200 crores
 ab vah khabar kaise likhegaa kyonki do saal kii jail se bachanaa bhi he
 Dear audience and dear reader, let us together walk the banks of the lake and try to understand this news using our own imaginations
 200 karod ke kathith rup se hue is gaban kaa sambandh us vaale saansad se lagata he jo us rose dilli se aae us mantri ke bagal main baithe the or chaay nahin pi rahe the, usee vaale saansad ke us kareebi adhikari ne unke kehane par niyamon ko todaa or us vaale vidhayak ke kareebi thekedaar ko 200 karod kaa theka de diya
 We know enough that the department is in a government building where the scam has taken place
 jisamen sau kamare hai or jinamein ek hazaar karmchaaree baithte hai
 In one of these rooms sits the officer who allegedly scammed 200 crores
 is ghotaale main uske rishtedaar bhi kathith rup se shaamil hai magar ham naam bataa denge to 2 saal kii jail ho jaaegi
 In which city, in which case, what is the scam, if we tell this much, then it will be known who is that department, who is the secretary of that department, who is the minister of that department, and we have two years Will be jailed aapako pataa na chale isliye ham bataa rahe hai ki maamla jaipur se uttar disha main sthit ek vibhaag kaa he jiskaa naam a he, sachiv kaa naam ba he or mantri kaa naam sa he, ghotaale kii raashi da he
 That officer of that department located in that building has allegedly done a scam of 200 crores in that case, which has happened in Bihar
 phir bhi kis imaarat main sthit kis vibhaag ke kis afasar ne kis maamle main 200 karod kaa wo vaala ghotaalaa kiya he, ye jaanane ke liye aapako 6 maheene kaa intazaar karnaa hoga, kyonki jab tak sarkaar apni jaanch ke baad exiaar karne kii anumati nahin degi, ham isse zyada nahin bataa sakate
 That's why little is written to understand more
 agar, exiaar kii anumati nahin mili to samajhie ki us imaarat main sthit us vibhaag ke us afasar ne us maamle main 200 karod kaa ghotaalaa nahin kiya he
 Is it not possible that instead of doing so much, governments should pass a law that only Lori will be printed in the press
 tivi main ankar loriyaan sunaayenge
 The BJP has an absolute majority, the way it brought the ordinance, it can also pass it
 abhi yah hota tha ki agar police exiaar nahin kar sakati to koi court jaakar aadesh le aata tha or jaanch shuru ho jaati thi
 But if this bill is passed, then even the court will not allow it
 yah zarur he ki agar rajya sarkaar chah maheene main injazat nahin detii he to ye mana jayega ki ijazat mil gai he, yahi nahin vidheyak main yah bhi likhaa he ki sarkaar ko apane faisale ke liye koi kaaran bataane kii zarurat nahin hogi
 The name of the MP and MLA is, the Chief Minister is not, so can there be an FIR against the Chief Minister or if the Chief Minister is also an MLA or is there, then the FIR will have to be approved against him
 uttar pradesh main mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ko lekar aisa hi ek maamla elahabaad court main lambit he
 In this regard, we are resorting to a report in March 2017 by Scroll
in which states that the Akhilesh government did not allow the prosecution of Yogi Adityanath
 grahamantralay bhi mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ke adheen he to kya ve apane kilaaf mukadmaa chalaane kii anumati denge?tippaniyan The case dates back to 2007, as an MP he is alleged to have incited violence and hatred
 gorakhpur ke patrkaar parvaiz paravaaz ne ek exiaar darj karai thi jisamen mukhyamantri yogi adityanath kaa bhi naam tha magar sarkaar ne mukadmaa chalaane kii anumati nahin di
 Since July 10, 2015, the case is awaiting permission
 saat saal main bhi antim faisla nahin hua he
 While the crime branch has completed the investigation
 court main sarkaar ke faisle kaa bachaav karte hue mukhya sachiv ne kaha tha ki parvaiz ne jo sidi jamaa karai thi usamen chhedchhad hui he
 It is not appropriate to comment more as the matter is in court
 dainik jaagran ne likhaa he ki 23 aktubar ko is maamle main sunwaayee hui
 The dock media is engaged in hymns and food, now the law will be made, then everyone will be relaxed that they will not be reported or else they will be jailed, but think from the eyes of the common man, what will happen to them if false cases are against you, Is your problem less than any MP or MLA or officer, the government has an army of lawyers to fight their case, what do you have
 karja, puja or koi nahin he duja
 What if there is no attack on the freedom of the press
 agar juthi exiaar likhaai ja rahi he to iskaa upaay yah hona chahie do chaar logon ke khilaaf exiaar likhavana mushkil kar do or baaki kaa unke haal par chhod do
 Is a separate police agency going to be formed for judges, magistrates, officers and mps? Do not forget that the government agencies also lodge false cases against citizens, in the case of terror, 20-20 years young people have been implicated in fake cases and kept in jail
 is vidheyak main is baat kaa zikr kyon nahin he
 Why hasn't the government made a provision of two years of jail against officers who have filed false cases
 jhuthe mukademe kya parshad, mukhiya, jila parishad ke sadasyon ke khilaaf nahin hote hai, unako kyon chhod diya he? According to the 2015 statistics of the National Crime Research Branch Bureau, in 2015, 40 lakh, 10 thousand, 195 cases were registered under IPC
 inamen se 1 lakh, 13 hazaar, 388 maamle jhuthe paae gaye
 Not even 3 percent of the total FIR
 rajasthan sarkaar ko 73 fisadi kahaan se aankada mila, kya rajasthan main juthi exiaar hi darj hoti hai
 By the way, the press release of the Rajasthan government has been very cleverly written
 kahin bhi saaf-saaf nahin likhaa he ki 73 fisadi juthi exiaar darj hui hai
 Let's look at the graphics one more time
 agar aap sarkaar kii baton ko ghayan se na dekhen to kab sadak ke bich main braker aa jayega pataa hi nahin chalegaa or aapkaa sar car kii chat se takaraa jayega
 The press release stated that all the cases between 2013 and 2017 have been filed in 156 (3)
 unamem se kareeb 73 pratishat mukademon main police ne effaar (final report) lagaai
 The press release did not say that the police found 73 percent of the firs in the final report to be false
 yah kaha he ki 73 fisadi maamalon main antim report pesh kar di
 During this period, about 73 per cent of the people faced false slander
 unhen doshi na hote hue bhi na keval maansik santaap jhelana padaa
 Not only 73, 100 percent people have to face mental anguish due to FIR
 is bayaan se aisa lagata he ki 27 fisadi aise bhi hai jo exiaar se khush hote hai, unhen kisi prakaar kii pareshaani nahin hoti he
 This bill is also against the media
 jab tak sarkaar exiaar kii anumati nahin degi, media apni report main us adhikari, saansad yaa vidhayak kaa naam nahin le saktaa he
 Even two years in jail if i tell your identity
 pratham soochna report main kahin nahin likhaa he ki jo likhaa gaya he vah saboot he yaa faisla he
 This only means that the police should start an investigation in this matter immediately
 editors gild ne kaha he ki pratyaksh rup se ye nyaaypalika or naukarshahi ko jhuthe exiar se bachaane ke liye laayaa gaya
 In reality, it is a deadly weapon to harass the media, hide the wrongdoings of bureaucrats and curb the freedom of the press given by the Constitution
 editors gild chahta he ki rajasthan sarkaar turant adhyadesh waapas le or ise kaanoon banane se parhez kare
 Instead of taking strict steps against fake and false cases, the Rajasthan government has brought an ordinance that wants to silence the messenger
 editors gild ne yah bhi kaha ki rajasthan sarkaar kaa ye qadam kathor he or ye janhit kii khabar dene vaale patrakaron ko giraftaar karne tak kii khuli chhot detaa he

 About 73 percent of them have frs (final report) by the police

 It has said that in 73 percent of the cases, a final report has been submitted

 Despite being guilty, he not only suffered mental anguish
 exiaar hone se 73 hi nahin 100 fisadi logon ko maansik santaap jhelana padataa he
 From this statement, it seems that there are 27 percent who are happy with the FIR, they do not have any kind of trouble

 editors gild ne kaha he ki pratyaksh rup se ye nyaaypalika or naukarshahi ko jhuthe exiar se bachaane ke liye laayaa gaya
 In reality, it is a deadly weapon to harass the media, hide the wrongdoings of bureaucrats and curb the freedom of the press given by the Constitution
 editors gild chahta he ki rajasthan sarkaar turant adhyadesh waapas le or ise kaanoon banane se parhez kare
 Instead of taking strict steps against fake and false cases, the Rajasthan government has brought an ordinance that wants to silence the messenger
 editors gild ne yah bhi kaha ki rajasthan sarkaar kaa ye qadam kathor he or ye janhit kii khabar dene vaale patrakaron ko giraftaar karne tak kii khuli chhot detaa he
 Parliament created a new CRPC code in 1970, stating that a person who is a judge or magistrate or public servant cannot be removed without the approval of the government if he is found to be accused of being involved in a crime
 Then the court will not take cognizance against him without sanction
 yahi nahin vidheyak laane se pehle rajasthan sarkaar ne raashtrapati se adhyadesh kaa anumodan liya he
 The ordinance has also been introduced and it has been introduced in the Legislative Assembly to make laws
 pipuls union for civil liberties ne is vidheyak ko rajasthan hycourt main chunauti dene kaa elaan kiya he
 Rajasthan's lawyer AK Jain has filed a petition in the court against this bill
 maan lijie ki yah vidheyak bagair sanshodhan ke paas ho jaataa he
 After that how would reporting a scam
 kya reporter khabar lekar 180 din baithegaa, sarkaar ke paas jayega ki aap exiaar anumati dijie to ham chhaapen
 Please, hang up for 180 days so that the scamster cleans both us and the evidence
 phir bhi reporting kaise hogi, iskaa ek namoona pesh karata hum
 It is not a sample, but the entire fabric is a police station
 reporter ko artiai se hasil jaankaree se pataa chalata he ki ek vibhaag main ek adhikari ne 200 karod kaa gaban kiya he
 Now how will he write the news because even two years jail is to be avoided
 priy darshak or priyatam pathak, aaiye aap or ham donon milakar jhil ke kinare chalate hai or apni apni kalpanaaon ke istemaal se is khabar ko samajhane kaa prayaas karte hai
 The alleged embezzlement of 200 crores of rupees is related to the MP who was sitting next to that minister who came from Delhi and was not drinking tea, that close officer of the same MP said the rules at his behest Broke and gave a contract of 200 crores to a contractor close to that MLA
 ham itnaa jaanate hai ki jahaan ghotaalaa hua he, wo vibhaag ek sarkari imaarat main he
 Which consists of a hundred rooms and in which a thousand employees sit
 inhen main se ek kamare main wo vaala afasar baithta he jisane 200 karod kaa kathith rup se ghotaalaa kiya he
 His relatives are also allegedly involved in this scam, but if we tell the name, there will be 2 years in jail
 kis shahar main, kis maamle main, kis chiz kaa ghotaalaa hua he agar ham itnaa bhi bataa denge to to pataa chal jayega ki wo vibhaag koun sa he, us vibhaag kaa sachiv koun he, us vibhaag kaa mantri koun he, or hamen do saal kii jail ho jaaegi
 If you do not know, then we are telling that the matter is of a department located in the north direction from Jaipur, the name is A, the name of the secretary is b and the name of the minister is the amount of scam
 us imaarat sthit us vibhaag ke us afasar ne us maamle main 200 karod kaa kathith rup se wo vaala ghotaalaa kiya he, jo vaala bihar main ho chukaa he
 However, in which building, in which department, in which case, in which case, in which case, that scam of 200 crores has been done, you will have to wait for 6 months to know, as long as the government will not allow the FIR to be done after its investigation , We cannot tell more than this
 isiilie thodaa likhaa he zyaada samajhnaa
 If the FIR is not approved, then understand that the officer of that department located in that building has not done a scam of 200 crores in that case
 kya aisa nahin ho saktaa ki sarkarein itnaa sab karne ke bajaae ek kanoon paas kar den ki press main sirf lori chhapegi
 Anchor lullabies will be played on TV
 bijepi ke paas sampurna bahumat he, jis tarah se vah adhyadesh le ai usee tarah se vah ise paas bhi kara sakati he
 Now it used to be that if the police could not file an FIR, then someone would go to court and get orders and the investigation would start
 magar yah vidheyak paas hua to court se bhi anumati nahin milegi
 It is sure that if the state government does not give the award in six months, then it will be considered that the permission has been granted, not only this, it is also written in the bill that the government will not have to give any reason for its decision
 saansad or vidhayak kaa naam he, mukhyamantri kaa nahin he, to kya mukhyamantri ke khilaaf epa ai aar ho sakati he yaa mukhyamantri bhi vidhayak hote hai yaa hoti hai to unke khilaaf bhi epa ai aar ke liye unheen se manzuri leni hogi
 In Uttar Pradesh, one such case is pending in the Allahabad court regarding Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath
 is bare main ham march 2017 kii scrol dot in kii ek report kaa sahaara le rahe hai jisamen bataaya gaya he ki akhilesh sarkaar ne yogi adityanath ke khilaaf mukadmaa chalaane kii anumati nahin di
 If the Home Ministry is also under Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, will he allow prosecution against him? The comments maamla 2007 kaa he, saansad ke taur par un par kathith rup se hinsa or nafrat bhadakaane kaa aarope he
 Gorakhpur journalist Parvez Parvaz had filed an FIR in which Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath was also named but the government did not allow the prosecution
 10 july, 2015 se yah maamla anumati kaa intazaar kar rahaa he
 The final decision has not been made even in seven years
 jabaki krime branch ne jaanch puri kar lee he
 Defending the government's decision in the court, the chief secretary said that the CD which Parvez had submitted was tampered with
 maamla adaalat main he isliye zyaada tippanee karnaa uchit nahin hoga
 Dainik Jagran has written that a hearing took place in the case on 23 October
 godi media vaise hi bhajan-bhojan main laga hua he ab kanoon hi ban jayega to sabko aaraam ho jayega ki report hi nahin kerani he varna jail ho jaaegi lekin aap aam aadmi kii nigaah se sochie, jhuthe mukademe aapke khilaaf honge to unka kya hoga, kya aapaki pareshaani kisi saansad yaa vidhayak yaa afasar se kam he, unka cese ladane ke liye to sarkaar ke paas vakeelon kii fouj hoti he, aapke paas kya hota he
 There is no other debt, worship and worship
 press kii azaadi par hamalaa nahin he to kya he
 If a false FIR is being written, then its solution should be to make it difficult to write an FIR against two people and leave the rest on their condition
 asaliyat main ye media ko tang karne, naukarshahon ke galat kaamon ko chupaane or samvidhan dwaara di gai press kii azaadi par lagaam lagane kaa ghaatak hathiyaar he

 Their purpose is to spread Bapu's ideas more and more by Digvijay
 "udhar, bhaajapa ne digvijay kii is kavayad ko "paakhand" qaraar dete hue congress par nishaanaa saadhaa he
 State BJP spokesperson Umesh Sharma said, "congress governments have named many roads across India after Mahatma Gandhi
 lekin desh kii aazaadee ke baad congress netaa baapu ke dikhaae maarg par kabhi nahin chale
 "he said," Now that the BJP is carrying forward Bapu's legacy in the country and the world, then the insane Digvijay is doing hypocrisy in the name of Gandhigiri

 This was a sign of Nitish's seal which is very important for Giriraj
 ve yahaan rashtriya janata dal ke tanwir hasan or bhakpa ke kanhaiya kumaar ke saath trikoniya mukaable main fanse hai
 The BJP hopes that Nitish's campaign will help the Union Minister of State for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises get the votes of the most backward classes (ebcs) and Dalits
 jad (you) sutron kaa kahana he ki 30 fisadi ibisi or 15 fisadi mahadalit party kaa mul vot bank hai
 There are more than 150 castes in these two sections which constitute 45% of the total voters of Bihar
 kaha jaataa he ki bhaajapa ke sheersh netritv ne nitish se giriraaj ke liye prachaar karne kaa anurodh kiya tha
 That is why the Chief Minister reached Begusarai on 22 April and again on 27 April to campaign for him
 giriraaj ke liye prachaar karne ko nitish ke liye rajnatik majaburi ke rup main dekha jaataa he jiske liye ve apane buniyadi mulyon se samjhauta karte hai
 Nitish and Giriraj are two different poles both in their ideology and methods
 nitish saamaajik sadbhaav or dharmanirpekshata kii vakaalat karte rahe hai, vahiin giriraaj apane kattar hindutvvaadi vichaaron ke liye jane jate rahe hai
 In fact, on April 23, a day after Nitish left his campaign, Giriraj again raised controversy, saying that the Election Commission should ban the use of green flags of Muslim organizations

 The BJP cut the tickets of its five sitting mps to replace Nitish's wish and also left the traditional seat of Bhagalpur
 jaahir he ki mukhyamantri ko bhi is ehsaan kaa badla chukaana hi tha
 However, a section of JD (U) leaders fear that it may go against the party's secular image
 bhaajapa ke saath gathbandhan kii ek traasadee yah rahi he ki matdaan ke chaar charan puure ho jane ke baad bhi jad (you) kaa chunavi ghoshnaptr abhi tak jari nahin ho paaya he
 In fact, the draft manifesto also included the party's clear stand against enforcing the Uniform Code of Conduct and the removal of Article 370, which is contrary to the bjp's views on these issues
 jad (you) ke ek netaa kaa kahana he, ''vot hasil karnaa dharmanirpekshata se zyada jaruri he
 As part of the NDA, JD (U) and BJP are contesting 17-17 seats in Bihar while Ram Vilas Paswan's Lok Janshakti Party is contesting six seats

 Team India coach Ravi Shastri said he would have preferred a 16-man squad for the World Cup instead of a mandatory list of 15 players
 rishabh pant, ambati raidu jaise khilaadiyon ko team main shaamil nahin kiye jane par unhone kaha ki jo world cap kii team main jagah nahin bana sake, unhen niraash hone kii jarurat nahin he
 India on Monday announced a 15-man squad for the World Cup starting in England from May 30 and the debate started after the selectors did not select young wicket-keeper batsman Rishabh Pant and veteran Ambati Rayudu
 shastri ne ek intervyuu main kaha, 'main chayan ke maamalon main shaamil nahin hona chahta
 If we have an opinion, we tell it to the captain
 'unhone kaha, 'jab aapako 15 khilaadiyon kaa hi chayan karnaa he to aisa hona laazmi hi he ki kisi na kisi ko baahar karnaa padegaa jo kaaphi durbhagyapurna he
 i wanted to include 16 players
 hamane isisi ko bhi iskaa zikr kiya tha jab ek toornament itnaa lanbaa ho to 16 khilaadiyon ko rakhana sahi hoga
 But the order was only for 15 players
 'bache khilaadiyon ko bhi mil saktaa he maukashasthri ne kaha ki jo 15 khilaadiyon kii suchi main jagah nahin bana sake, unhen aage dekhnaa chahie kyonki mauka kabhi bhi mil saktaa he
 He said, 'those who could not make a place in it, they need not be disappointed
 yah kaaphi ajeeb sa khel he
 It can cause injuries
 isaliye aapako nahin pataa ki aapako bhi bulaava mil saktaa he
 When asked about the fourth position of Vijay Shankar, while captain Virat Kohli revealed Rayudu to be the frontrunner for this place a few months ago, Shastri said that this place is always for flexibility
 unhone kaha, 'paristhitiyon or pratidwandvi ko dekhte hue chauthe number kaa sthaan puri tarah se lacheela he
 i would say that the top three
 
 
 ke baad aap bahut hi lacheele ho sakate ho
 'india did better in 5 years, the philosopher also rejected the criticisms that India was seen to be very dependent on Kohli
 unhone kaha, 'agar aap pichley 5 varshon ko dekho to jis tarah se bhartiya team ne pradarshan kiya he, vah hameshaa hi sheersh do yaa teen main rahi he
 When a team stays in the top two or three for five consecutive years and remains number one in Tests and then top three in T20 cricket, you cannot depend on any one player
 'unhone kaha, 'jab aapkaa ricard itnaa nirantar he to aapke khilaadiyon ke har samay pradarshan karne kii jarurat hoti he
 The credit for this goes to the team

 com / qdar03adsf Lalu Yadav has written in it, 'right now when Bihar is going to write a new saga
 loktantr kaa utsav chal rahaa he
 Sitting alone in a hospital in Ranchi here, i am wondering if the subversive powers will be able to imprison me in this way and write a conspiracy story in Bihar
 mere rahete biharvasiyon ke saat main phir se dhokhaa nahin hone duungaa
 i am in captivity, my thoughts right there
 apane vichaaron ko aapse saajha kar rahaa hum, kyonki ek duusare se vichaaron ko saajha karke hi ham in baantne vaali takato se lard sakate hai
 He further wrote, 'this time everything is at stake in the elections
 is baar kaa chunaav pehle jaisaa nahin he
 The country, society, Lalu means that you have the courage to walk with your head raised and your rights and respect and dignity are at stake
 ladaai aar-paar kii he
 There is a trap around my neck from the government and the tricksters
 umr ke saath sharir saath nahin de rahaa par aan or aabru kii ladaai main lalu kii lalkaar hameshaa rahegi
 The decision of the Supreme Court for Lalu Prasad Yadav is also the biggest blow, because this will be the first time since 1977 that Lalu Prasad Yadav will not be involved in any election campaign
 bataa den ki 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav or 2015 main bihar vidhansabha chunaav main apni party ke liye lalu prasad ne prachaar kiya tha, haalanki, us vakt bhi vah jail se jamaanat par baahar aae the
 Many things will be new after the Supreme Court Judgment
 masalan, 1977 ke baad jab lalu prasad yadav pehali baar chunaav lade the or saaran se saansad ke rup main chune gaye the, chunaav prachaar nahin kar paaenge
 He was disqualified for his involvement in the fodder scam, which prevented him from contesting the election, but was involved in campaigning for his party in the 2014 elections and the 15 assembly elections
 itnaa hi nahin, jab tak chaara ghotaalaa ke hi ek maamle main sibiai kii special court main doshi paae gaye lalu prasad yadav ko hai courtbari nahin kar detaa, tab tak lalu prasad yadav kaa jail se baahar nikalnaa kaaphi mushkil he
 Let us know that Lalu Prasad has been convicted in three cases related to the fodder scam worth more than nine hundred crore rupees
 ye maamle 1990 ke dashak main, jab jharkhand bihar kaa hissaa tha, dhokhe se pashupaalan vibhaag ke khajaane se dhan nikaalane se sambandhit hai
 Lalu Prasad had cited his age and declining health for bail in the High Court, stating that he was suffering from diabetes, blood pressure and various other ailments and had already got bail in a case related to the fodder scam
 rajd supremeo ko jharkhand main sthit devgarh, dumka or chibasa ke do koshagaar se chal se dhan nikaalane ke aparaadh main doshi tehraaya gaya he
 At present, he is under trial in connection with the withdrawal of funds from Doranda treasury
 bijepi nevishesh jaanch dal (esaiti)kii report par santosh jataayaa he
 The SIT has reportedly stated that no evidence has been found to prosecute the Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi
 bijepi ne kaha, isse sabit ho gaya he ki gadhe gaye subut sach nahin hote
 bjp's chief spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad said here, "as per media reports, the SIT has said in its report presented to the Metropolitan Magistrate's court that no evidence has been found against the Chief Minister regarding the Gujarat riots
 unhone kaha ki dangon main gulburg sosayadi narsanhaar main maare gaye congress ke purv saansad ahsaan jaafaree kii patni zakiya jaafaree kii shikaayat par supreme court ke nirdesh par esaiti kaa gathan kiya gaya tha
 But according to media reports, the SIT has not found any evidence to prosecute the riots against the Chief Minister of Gujarat
 prasad ne kaha, ‘agar media kii ye report sahi he to hamen bahut santosh he
 In order to implicate Modi, the Congress and some organizations at the national and international level were being misinformed for the last ten years
 lekin ab sabit ho gaya he ki gadhe gaye subut sach nahin hote
 Describing the riots as unfortunate, he said that the culprits should be punished, but making the riots a weapon of propaganda against Narendra Modi is grossly unfair
 is sawaal par ki esaiti kii report ke baad kya modi bijepi kii ore se pradhanmantri pad ke prabal ummidavaaron main shaamil ho gaye hai, unhone kaha ki is baat main koi shaq nahin he ki modi bhaajapa ke varisht netaa hai or pradesh tathaa rashtriya donon str par unki mahatvapurn bhoomika rahegi
 On the other hand, Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Sushma Swaraj expressed relief on this alleged clean chit given to Modi and said that at least now the malicious propaganda against the Chief Minister of Gujarat should be ended
 sushamaa ne twitor par kaha, ‘supreme court dwaara gathit esaiti kaa kahana he ki narendra modi ke khilaaf koi subut nahin hai
 It is a great relief for us
 das saal se chale aa rahe ninda prachaar ko ab to samaapt ho janaa chahie

 bharat ke paas bumraah, shami, umesh or eshanth jaise vishwastareey tej gendbaaj hanye gendbaaj kisi bhi halaat main vipakshi ballebaaji kram ke parakhche uda sakate henworld cricket main sabase khatarnaak tej gendbaaji akraman ke bare main sochane par endi roberts, maaikel holding, joel garnor, colin croft or mailkam marshall kaa naam jehan main aata he
 At a time when Caribbean cricket is at an end, it seems that Indian pacers have imbibed all the qualities of its fast bowlers and that is why today they have emerged as 'toppers' worldwide
 ek samay tha, jab bharat ke paas kapil dev the, lekin vah akele the
 After this came Javagal Srinath, Venkatesh Prasad, Zaheer Khan and Ashish Nehra and Irfan Pathan but they either played alone or could play dukes
 aaj alam yah he ki bharat ke paas paanch yaa yun kahen ki chah aise tej gendbaaj hai, jo kisi bhi halaat main kisi bhi team ke ballebaaji kram ke parakhche uda sakate hai
 India has world-class fast bowlers in the form of Jaspreet Bumrah, Mohammed Shami, Umesh Yadav, Ishant Sharma, Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Hardik Pandya and most importantly they are all serving the team together
 aise bhartiya cricket ke itihaas main isse pehle kabhi nahin hua tha
 2019 is about to end and this year the name of Indian fast bowlers is on everyone's tongue
 iskaa kaaran bhartiya tej gendbaajon kaa is saal kaa pradarshan he, jo kai myanon main aitihaasik he
 Seeing the current attack of India, everyone has assumed that India has the most dangerous and capable fast bowler of this time
 yah baat aankadon se bhi sabit hoti he
 Test average of Indian bowlers in 2019 is just 15
 16 rahaa he, jo pradarshan ke lihaaj se abhi tak ke cricket itihaas main ek calendar saal main 50 se adhik wicket lene vaale bowling atake kaa doosraa sarvshereshth pradarshan he
 Not only this, it is also the best average of any fast bowling attack this year
 australia 22
 Ranked second with 49
 saath hi yah pichley 67 saal main kisi ek calendar saal main kisi team ke bowling atake kaa yah sabase acha samuhik gendbaaji ausat he
 Fast bowling attack best, Indian strike rate of 31 this year
 06 he, jo test itihaas main kisi team ke fast bowling atake kaa sarvshereshth strike rate he
 Australia ranks second in this case
 australian gendbaajon kaa is saal 46
 6 strike rate
 is dauraan in bhartiya gendbaajon ne kul 116 wicket liye hai
 India has always been famous for spinners
 bies chandrashekhar, bishan singh bedi, irapalli prasanna, venkat raghavan ke baat kii viraasat ko maninder singh, anil kumble, harbhajan singh ne sambhala
 Indian fast bowlers have never been in the news, but now Tehelka is making fast bowlers
 bumraah, eshanth, umesh, shami, bhubaneshwar ke nijee pradarshan kii baat karen to eshanth ne is saal kul chah test match khele hai
 In these six matches, the tall bowler has taken 34 wickets in his name
 is dauraan unka ausat 15
 56 and strike rate 32
 5 rahaa
 At the same time, Umesh played four Test matches this year and took 14 wickets in his name
 umesh is saal test team se baahar hi chal rahe the lekin bhubaneshwar kumaar kii chot ne unhen dakshin africa siries main vaapasi karai
 Umesh's average of 13 this year
 65 rahaa he jabaki strike rate 23
 1 is swing par ballebaajon ko nachaane vaale shamiapani swing ke dam par ballebaajon ko nachaane vaale shami bhi peeche nahin hai
 This year, the West Bengal bowler has played eight Test matches and has taken 49 wickets in his name
 is dauraan shami kaa ausat 16
 66 and strike rate 23
 1 rahaa
 The special thing in Shami's performance is that he has been very economical for India in the second innings
 chot ke kaaran dakshin africa or bangladesh siries se baahar rahane vaale bumraah ne is saal sirf teen test match khele hai or in maichon main daaen haath ke is gendbaaj ne 19 wicket apane naam kiye hai
 Bumrah has a lower average than his peers
 bumraah kaa is saal ausat 13
 14 while strike rate is 30
 09 rahaa
 These figures show that the spin-dominated Indian team now also has fast bowlers who can take wickets everywhere
 inkaa prabhutv is tarah kaa rahaa he ki bangladesh ke khilaaf eden gardens stadium main khele gaye din-raat test match main rabindra jadeja or ravichandran aswin jaise diggaj spinner wicket nahin le paae or mehmaan team ke puure 20 wicket tej gendbaajon ne hi nikaale
 This is not the first year that Indian bowlers have done well
 saal 2018 main bharat ne apane lagbhag sabhi test videshi jameen par khele the
 Indian bowlers took 158 wickets in these 11 Test matches
 yah ek saal main kisi bhi fast bowling atake kaa viketon ke lihaaj se doosraa sarvshereshth pradarshan tha
 Bowling attack like Windies: Fast bowling attack was the highest wicket-taker in a year, with Garner, Croft, Holding
 marshall, robtters or silavester clark jaise gendbaaj the
 This attack took a total of 189 wickets in 1980
 pichley saal bharat ne yahaan lagbhag sabhi test baahar khele the to vahiin is saal usne apane zyaadaatar test bharat main khele hai
 Indian fast bowlers also do well on foreign ground
 ullekhneey he ki eshanth, shami, bhubaneshwar or bumraah ne apane kariyar main adhikansh wicket oversij main liye hai
 This is due to the help of wickets and conditions, but even if the fast bowlers dominate the Indian ground, which is considered to be the base of spinners, then it tells what kind of sharp bowling attack is there and it is definitely the Indian This is the beginning of a new era for cricket
 bhartiya vayusena ne pakistan main aatankiyon ke thikaanon par hamalaa kiya

 The CAG report of Delhi has revealed a big problem regarding rationing
 report saamne aate hi aam aadmi party sarkaar sawaalon se ghir gai he
 On this, the statement of Deputy CM Manish Sisodia has come
 manish sisodiya ne kaha ki hamaare upar aarope nahin lage hai, balki aarope to main laga rahaa hum
 Sisodia claimed that whoever is guilty will not leave, whether minister or criminal or LG
 manish sisodiya ne kaha ki is report main sab kuch saaf-saaf likhaa he
 This is not just a matter of 3 years, but it has a raw letter of the last 8-10 years
 is report main 25 saalon tak ke record nikalakar saamne aae hai
 Manish Sisodia alleged that we have been saying for the last 3 years that there is corruption in the ration department
 kareeb dedh saal pehle hamane yojana banaai ki rashan main bhrashtachar he or uparajyapal se kaha ki ham door step delivery vaali nai yojana laa rahe hai
 The Lieutenant Governor said that he has held talks with the officers and the officers have told them that everything is fine
 afasaron ne file par likh rakhaa he ki sab kuch thik chal rahaa he, isliye us yojana kii jarurat nahin he
 According to Sisodia, now the CAG report is showing that there is a theft in the rental system
 jis chori ko ham 3 saal se bataa rahe hai ki chori ho rahi he, hamen vyavastha badalane do
 We say remove officers, do not remove LG officers
 ham kehete hai in ko suspend karo, LG suspend nahin karte
 We say let's change this system, LG doesn't change the system
 'hua ghotaalaa'manish sisodiya ne bataaya ki sieji report kahati he ki is vyavastha main is had tak chori ho rahi he ki godaam se rashan kii dukaan tak le jane ke liye jin trakon kaa istemaal hua, unke number yaa to scooter ke the yaa motorcycle yaa thri whealer kaa number tha
 One who comes on ration trucks, the CAG report says that he has arrived on a scooter or motorcycle
 iskaa matlab ki ghotaalaa ho rahaa he or neeche gadabad ho rahi he
 When we are saying that there is a mess, then the Lieutenant Governor does not take action on any officer, does not even transfer it, does not even give him a show cause notice
 manish sisodiya ke anusaar uparajyapal ghotaalon ko dabaane ke liye in afasaron ko kyon bachaa rahe hai? netritv or chuni hui sarkaar hi in ghotaalon ko uthaa rahi he
 The minister says that come by inspection, the officer does not go to inspect and transfer it to the Lieutenant Governor
 netritv, mantri or upmukhyamantri jis baat ko cheekh cheekh kar kah rahe the sieji ne vahi baat ko sahi tareeke se chaan chaan kar saamne laa die hai
 'this was the reason why door step delivery' The door step delivery of the ration was brought because the solution would have come from that
 imran hossain ne karrwai kii, lekin aage kii karrwai nahin hui
 Ever since the High Court order has come, since the transfer of an officer is not discussed with the minister
 uparajyapal kii marji chalati he yaa secretary kii marji chalati he
 'I have made my own complaint' Sisodia said that i have already told the Lieutenant Governor that an officer has filed till affidavit in favor of private school

 How exciting this match was can be gauged from the fact that Australia declared their first innings a few overs before lunch on the fifth day and Pakistan played only four overs
 iske baad tii brake tak aadhi pakistani team pavilion pahunch chuki thi or din kaa khel khatm hone se pehle hi australia ne haal ke dinon main apni sabase yaadgaar jeet main se ek darj kar lee

 On this basis, the Australian team gained a lead of 181 runs
 lekin khel ke aakhri din pakistan apni duusari main sirf 163 ranon par olout ho gai
 With this, Pakistan lost the series along with the match
 australian captain steven smith ko unki shandaar 165 ranon kii noout pari ke liye main of da match ke khitaab se nawaja gaya
 The match started early on the last day of the game, the fourth day of the Melbourne Test was not played due to rain
 lekin khel ke aakhri dinaustraliankptain steven smith ne teji se ran banaae or apni team ko ek bade score tak pahunchaa diya
 Smith scored 165 runs in 246 balls with the help of 13 fours and a six
 smith ko michel stark (84) kaa acha saath mila
 Both shared a 154-run partnership for the seventh wicket
 stark ne sirf 91 gendon main 3 chauko or saat chhakkon kii madad se 84 ran banaae
 He broke this partnership by getting Sohail Khan caught out by Asad Shafiq
 australian gendbaajon kaa rahaa jalawakhel ke chauthe din yaha muqabla barish kii vajah se puraa nahin ho sakaa tha or aisa lag rahaa tha ki yahmuqabladro ho jayega
 But Pakistan's start in the second innings was very bad as Majuh fell two wickets for six runs
 jiske baad use lagaatara jatke lagate rahe

 lekin ek rang kii chunari odhakar ham bataanaa chaahate hai ki ab auraten ekajute ho gai hai
 "nirmala's answer is Nazir's answer to women living in big cities and the answer for those who divide violence against women into religion and community
" saamaanya si dikhne vaali ye auraten bade-bade makasad ke liye lard rahi hai
 From alcohol detention to education, from employment to women's health, many of these women fighting on so many fronts have written many success stories

 isse pehle kendriya mantri rajeev shukla ne kaha tha ki bill aaj hi pesh kiya jayega
 Earlier, opposition to the Telangana bill started as soon as the Rajya Sabha started, due to which the proceedings had to be postponed twice
 telugana vivaad ke chalate aaj rajyasabha adhikari se dhakka-mukki kii gai or narebaaji or hangaame ke baad kaarywahi ko sthagit karnaa padaa

 He alleged that the feelings of the people of Seemandhra have not been taken care of
 kendriya mantri pallam raju ne bhi chiranjeevi ke vichaar kaa samarthan karte hue kaha ki vah vidheyak ko paarit karne ke tareeke se dukhi hai or vah apni party or sarkaar main virodh jataate rahenge

 photedaar or vincent jorge ne party adhyaksh ke liye sonia gandhi ke naam par vichaar kiya
 According to Arjun Singh, he first took Sitaram Kesari
 seetaram kesari se hari jhandi milane ke baad arjuna singh, kesari or photedaar narsimha raav ke paas pahunche
 Arjun Singh wrote, Hearing our suggestion, Rao remained silent for a few minutes with a calm gesture, then suddenly screamed with anger and his words meant something like this
 'kya yah jaruri he ki congress party ke saath aisi railgadee kii tarah pesh aayaa jaae jiske saare dibbe nehru-gandhi khandaan ke ingine se khinche jate rahenge yaa koi anya vikalp nahin he? raav ke gussa jaahir karne ke andaaj ko dekhakar main thaga sa rah gaya
 Rao felt that he had said too much in a short period of time and in a hurry exposed his feeling of opposition to the Nehru family
 unhone sanbhalte hue poocha- is suzav se koi nuksaan nahin hone vaala lekin kya wo ise sweekaar karengi
 Arjun Singh has proved his loyalty in this book, but the role of those who were not in his goodlist has also been questioned
 tay he ki arjuna singh kii kitaab se kai ghatnaon par nai bahes chhid gayi he
 Arjun Singh's book refers to the Babri Masjid incident
 is dauraan unhone narsimha raav par nero jaisi bhoomika main rahane kaa aarope lagaaya
 The role of Prime Minister Narasimha Rao on the movement of Ayodhya is also mentioned in detail in the book of Arjun Singh
 ayodhya cond par pradhanmantri narsimh raav sabhi ko khush karne kii koshish main the
 On one occasion, he decided to go and meet the RSS chief himself
 maine is prastaavit kadam par aapatti jataai or kaha ki isse sarkaar kii badi badanaami hogi
 By now the differences between me and the Prime Minister had become public
 arjuna singh ne 6 disambar ke pehle hui har halchal kaa kitaab main vistaar se zikr kiya he
 He claims that Narasimha Rao did not take the whole matter seriously
 arjuna singh ne ye bhi likhaa he unhone is baat kii chetavanee pehle hi de di thi ki kisi bhi vakt babari masjid kaa dhaancha giraaya ja saktaa he
 Arjun Singh writes, 'I called Muktsar at the Prime Minister's residence in the afternoon
 mujhe bataaya gaya ki wo kisi se baat nahin kar sakate
 They have locked themselves in a room and we have been instructed not to disturb them under any circumstances
 mere dimag main achaanak nero kii wo mashhoor chhavi kaundh gai ki jab rome jal rahaa tha vah bansuri baja rahaa tha
 'arjun Singh and Narasimha Rao's differences were well known
 arjuna singh ko is baat kaa bharosa tha ki gandhi parivaar se unki vafadari kabhi naa kabhi rang jarur laaegi, lekin 2009 main cabinet list se arjuna singh kaa naam gaayab tha
 Arjun Singh has written that he was hurt from within
 beshak arjuna singh ke liye maananaa mushkil tha ki unki pari ab khatm ho chuki he
 Arjun Singh is no more, it is another matter that there will be many new revelations with stories of politics recorded in the pages, many aspects of one truth will be revealed

 bhartiya janata party ke adhyaksh amit shah ne karnataka ke aagaamee vidhansabha chunaav ko lekar kaha ki bijepi karnataka ke chunaav jeetne ja rahi he
 He also accused the Congress that "the way Siddaramaiah (chief Minister of Karnataka) is running the state, an anti-government wave will definitely work in it
" iske alaava pradhanmantri narendra modi kii apaar lokapriyata bhi factor he
 On 'aaj Tak's flagship show' Sidhi Baat ', he said on the issue related to Lingayat,' The people of Karnataka and the Lingayat community are well aware that the Congress rejected the proposal to give this community a separate religion status in 2013
 
 congress is mudde ko hawa de rahi he kyonki wo jaanati he ki vikaas ke naam par wo chunaav nahin lard sakati
 Shah, on the other hand, refused to go to temples, churches and mosques on behalf of Congress President Rahul Gandhi to woo voters, saying that he had also visited temples in Gujarat and Himachal
 lekin kya hua?khud amit shah bole: ye shah-modi kaa daur nahin, ye keval modi kaa daur he, padhein 10 bade bayaan'endie nahin tuutegaa'endie se telugu desham party ke alag hone or shivasena ke 2019 main bina gathbandhan akele chunaav ladane ko lekar unhone kaha ki 2014 main kai nai partiyon ne hamaare saath haath milaayaa tha
 11 parties joined us and only one of them has separated
 endie nahin tuutegaa
 'SP and BSP alliance responsible for by-election': Shah blamed the SP-BSP alliance on the occasion for the crushing defeat in Uttar Pradesh by-election
 saath hi unhone kaha ki party ne haar ke kaarnon kii samiksha karne ke liye ek samiti gathit kii he or party 2019 main 50 fisadi vot share ke liye ladaai ladane ko taiyaar hai
 On the question of messing up the electoral arithmetic of the BJP with the possibility of a coalition of strong opponents SP and BSP in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections on the lines of the by-election, Shah said that it is not easy
 ‘sidhi baat’ main bole amit shah, pakistan kii har goli kaa jawaab ham gole se denge'2019 main milegi sabase zyada siten'unhone kaha ki media do siton (gorakhpur or phulpur) ke nateezon ko lekar baag-baag he
 The Congress distributed sweets in the Parliament complex that we have lost eight seats in the by-elections but no one is saying that we have taken away 11 states from them
 koi bhi tripura kaa naam nahin le rahaa, jahaan do hafte pehle hi hamane baari jeet hasil kii
 Shah also said that we have formed a committee to investigate the reasons for the defeat and the report that will come from it will be worked on
 hamen yah dhyaan rakhana hoga ki upachunaav sthaneey muddon ko dhyaan main rakh kar lade jate hai, har sthaneey chunaav kaa alag paridrishy hota he, lekin aam chunaav main bade netaa or bade mudde shaamil hote hai
 In 2019, BJP and National Democratic Alliance will gain more seats
 jo jeet congress ko 50 saalon se nahin mili, 2019 main hamen milegi: sidhi baat main amit shah'bharat bam se degaa jawaab'unhone kaha ki 1967 ke baad congress kabhi bhi 50 fisadi se zyada vot hasil karne main safal nahin hui he
 We got 50 per cent of the votes in Gujarat, Himachal and Tripura
 bahudaleey loktantric vyavastha main 50 fisadi se adhik vot jeetna bada janadesh hota he
 Regarding Pakistan, he said that India will respond to every bullet of Pakistan with a bomb
 yahi ekmaatr samaadhaan he
 We cannot hold peace talks between bullets and bombs
 (dekhen puraa video) However, everyone says that money cannot give happiness
 lekin kai baar vaaki isse khushi kharidi ja sakati he
 If you are not sure of our point then know these ways and change your perspective - 1) Buy the experience, not the stuff
 Experts believe that spending money on holiday or adventure sports experiences lasts longer than buying stuff
 
 isaki vajah yah he kiapake anubhav yaaden banakar aapke dimag menrahate hai or jab bhi aap inke bare main sochate hai, mood ekadam rifresh ho jaataa he
 2) Spend your money on others: According to a research, you get more happiness by spending money on other people, usually friends or family, than spending money on yourself
 isliye khush rahane ke liye dusron kii khushiyon ko apane se jodna shuru kar den
 Besides, doing charity or helping the needy is also a better way to find happiness
 3) choti chizon main dhundhen khushiyankai baar ek icecream yaa yahaan tak ki salon main head massage lene se jo relaxeshan kii feeling aegi, usase bhi aapako khushi milegi
 You don't necessarily have to wait for something big to get happiness
 choti safaltaaon yaa maukon par bhi aisa kiya ja saktaa he
 4) Buy leisure time, try to buy time for yourself and spend that leisure time in the things that you like to do
 jaise agar aapako khaanaa bananaa nahin pasand he to aap ek cook rakh sakate hai or jo samay bache, use un kaamon main laga sakat hai jo aapako khushi dete hon
 5) Spend on hobbies
 If you spend on the membership of a sports club or join a class in which you are deeply interested, then happiness will not be away from you
 apnipasand kaa kaam karne par jo sukun miltaa he,uski khushi lambey samay tak aapke saath rahati he or choti paristh tiyon main aapako tuutane nahin detii

 Sibal said, 'the Prime Minister's Office is the main center of our parliamentary democracy
 ek swatantra lekin nirankush janalokapal puri vyavastha ko buree tarah asthir kar saktaa he
 The Lokpal can do an inquiry against the Prime Minister only to find out whether the allegations against him are baseless
 isse sansadeey loktantr ko thes pahonchegi
 He said that the Prime Minister is not exempt from prosecution under the existing system
 kisi maamle main agar tathy saarvajanik daayre main hon to vyavastha kisi bhrasht vyakti ko pradhanmantri pad par nahin bane rahane de sakati
 In the second episode of his article released through the Press Information Office, Sibal said that it would be a historical mistake to weaken the Prime Minister's organization amidst the volatile neighborhood and the real threat of terrorism
 sibbal ne apane lekh main kaha, ‘janalokapal vidheyak ke bare main chintaa kii ek or vajah saansadon ko abhiyojan ke daayre main laane kii koshish se judi he
 Article 105 (2) of the constitution protects the right of Members of Parliament to put their voice and vote inside the House
 ye do adhikaar bahumoolya hai
 The Union Minister said that by bringing the use of these rights of Members of Parliament under the purview of the prosecution, questions will be raised on everything the mps say and every vote they cast
 is tarah kaa adhikaar lokapal ko dene ke liye sanvaidhanik sanshodhan kii jarurat hogi
 Sibal said that the solution to this issue lies with the Ethics Committee of Parliament, which can take action against any member on receipt of prima facie evidence of corruption and seek prosecution approval from the Speaker

 Modi government 2
 0 ke pehle loksabhaa satr kii shuruyaat ho gai he
 Today the budget session has started and new mps will be sworn in
 isse pehle pradhanmantri narendra modi ne jab media ko sambodhit kiya to unhone ishaaron-ishaaron main vipaksh ko naseehat de di
 The PM said that the opposition left the worry of the number game and raised the issues of public welfare
 pradhanmantri ke is bayaan se ab kayaas lagane lage hai ki kya modi sarkaar bada dil dikhaate hue vipakshi party congress ko loksabhaa main netaa vipaksh kaa pad degi?bataa den ki pichhali loksabhaa main bhi netaa vipaksh kaa pad kisi party ko nahin mil paaya tha
 And this time the number game is telling the same
 vipaksh main congress is samay sabase badi party he or uske paas kul 52 saansad hai
 While 10 percent of the strength of the House is required for the post of Leader of the Opposition, 55 seats are required for the post of Leader of the Opposition
 haalanki, chunaav nateezon ke baad congress party kii ore se bayaan diya gaya tha ki unke paas netaa vipaksh kii sankhya nahin he, isliye vah is pad kii maang bhi nahin karenge
 'modi would like to give this post to Congress only', senior journalist Urmilesh also said on this issue that there is no party in the opposition that has such a number that it can get the post of Leader of the Opposition
 hamaare news channel ajtak par charchaa ke dauraan unhone kaha ki congress ke sansadeey dal kaa netaa jo hoga, vahi vipaksh kaa netaa bhi hoga
 Urmilesh said that the ruling party would like that the post of Leader of the Opposition would like the Congress to get it, because showing such a big heart with such a strong majority will also give a good message
 gauratlab he ki pichley kaarykaal main mallikarjun khadge congress ke netaa sadan the jo ki vipaksh kii sabase badi party hone ke kaaran ‘netaa vipaksh’ kii bhoomika main hi rahete the
 However, the Modi government did not officially give him this post, for which he continued to fight for five years
 ab ek taraf vipaksh ke netaa ko lekar charchaaen tej ho rahi hai to vahiin duusari ore abhi bhi congress kaa netaa sadan koun hoga, iskaa intjaar he
 The last time Mallikarjun Kharge held this position, but now he himself has lost the election
 aise main congress kii ore se ye pad koun sanbhaalega is par sawaal he, kya khud rahul gandhi ye pad sanbhaalenge iske bhi kayaas tej hai
 Before the commencement of the proceedings of the House, the Prime Minister addressed the media and said that the people of the opposition leave worrying about the number, their feeling is valuable for us
 sansad main ham paksh-vipaksh ko chhod nishpaksh kii tarah kaam karen
 The PM said that we hope that more work will be done in the House this time
