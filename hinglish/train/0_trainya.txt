 court ne kaha ki aise maamlo main unke maansik rog ke aadhaar par unakisja-e-maut ko umrakaid kii sajaa main badalanaa chahie
 Today's verdict could have an impact on many cases, including mercy petitions filed by the three convicts awaiting sentence in the murder of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi
 unhone apni dayaa yachika radd karne ke raashtrapati ke kadam ko chunauti dithi
 With regard to the handling of mercy petitions and execution of punishment-a-death, a bench headed by Chief Justice p Sadasivam said that prisoners sentenced to death must be informed of the cancellation of their mercy petition
 unhen faansidene se pehle apane parivaar ke sadasyon se mulaakaat kaa ek mauka bhi jarur milanachahie
 The court termed it unconstitutional to keep any detainees, including detainees awaiting sentencing-in-death, in Kokide-e-lonai
 bench ne yah bhi kaha kidayayachika radd hone ke 14 dinon ke andar sajaa-e-maut par amal kar liya janachahie

 in dinon ek chitthee jharkhand ke mukhyamantri shibu sorain ke gale kii fans ban gai he
 Today, there is a by-election in the Tamar assembly constituency and a letter has been issued by the Naxalites to vote for Shibu Soren
 ab vipaksh ise mudda bana rahaa he or guruji bhannaae hue hai
 Guruji is angry
 gusse se aag babula ho rahe hai
 The reason for the by-election in Tamad on Monday
 mukhyamantri shibu sorain kii upachunaav main gardan fansi hui he
 The contest has become triangular and meanwhile, this letter of Naxalites has started roaming in the assembly constituency
 is chitthee main naksaliyon ne guruji ko hi vot dene kaa farmaan sunaaya he or farmaan naa maanane par gram pradhan ke liye mukarrar kii he sajaa-e-maut
 Guruji is awash with the questions being raised about this letter and he feels that the neck may not be lost in the affair of the Naxalites
 haalanki shibu sorain ise vipaksh kii chaal bataa rahe hai
 This area of tamar in Ranchi is a stronghold of Naxalites
 isi ilaake main naksaliyon ne jediu vidhayak kii dindahaade hatya kar di thi
 In such a situation, the Opposition is alleging that Shibu Soren is trying to win elections by fearing Naxalites
 guruji par isse pehle thane se teen naksaliyon ko chhudwane kaa daag laga tha
 The Opposition then accused him of calling the Chief Minister's residence in the Assembly
 lekin chitthee kaa maamla zyada pechida he
 Naxalites' reported letter has come just before the election
 bhartiya mul ke america yoga guru ne apane ke kareeb 46 saal choti ladki koyog sikhaane ke bahanehawas kaa shikaar bana daalaa
 Guru Bikram Chaudhary, who invented 'hot Yoga', had earlier accused five girls of rape
 duniya ke saikadon celibrities is yoga guru ke diwane hai
 Read the rape case of a yoga guru
 
 
 bikram choudhary ne ab se koi 40 saal pehle jab bharat chhodkar pehali baar america main apana kadam rakhaa, tab usne khwaabon main bhi nahin sochaa tha ki ek roj wo apane yogasana kii badaulat america ke saath-saath puri duniya main raaj karne lagegaa, lekin apni koshish or kismat kii badaulat usne jo kuch hasil kiya, uski duusari misaal koi ho hi nahin sakati
 
 
 
 or hot yoga main tabdeel ho gaya hath yogavideshiyon ke liye yoga ek nai cheez to thi hi, bikram ne 100 fahrenheit yani takreeban 40 degree celsius ke taapmaana par logon ko yoga siikhaa kar unhenchust-durust rakhane kaa jo anokhaa nuskhaadhundh nikaala, usne dekhte hi dekhte yoga ke saath-saath choudhary ko bhi shoharat kii bulandiyon par pahunchaa diya
 Along with ordinary Americans, Chaudhary became crazy after seeing people from all over the world and especially celebrities
 hindustan kaa saalon purana hath yoga ab'hot yoga'main tabdeel ho chukaa tha
 Chaudhary took advantage of the opportunity and got a patent for 26 hot yoga rugs
 dhire-dhire choudhary ne har wo cheez hasil kii, jisaki khwaahish kisi aam insaan ko ho sakati he
 Be it a luxurious bungalow, expensive car or a wealth of crores
 choudhary ke paas sabakuch tha lekin is sheesh mahal par tab pehali daraar pad gai, jab usee kii ek student ne us par balaatkaar karne kaa iljaam laga kar puri duniya main sansani failaa di
 After this, like Chaudhary Parayoun, the accusations of persecution started
 is student kii dekhadekhi chaar or ladakiyon ne choudhary par bilkul milte-julate iljaam lagaae, jinamein se kai maamalon par philhal america adaalat sunwaayee bhi kar rahi he
 After almost two years, Chaudhary has been accused again of exactly the same as it was before
 is baar bhi balaatkaar kaa iljaam lagane vaali ye ladki koi or nahin, balki unase 46 saal choti unki ek student he
 For the first time, in 2010, if the rape of the American newspaper New York Times, the Canadian-origin girl has not only shocked everyone by accusing him of Bikram Chaudhary, but has also filed a lawsuit against him in the US court
 choudhary par ilzaam lagane vaali ladki jill lollar ne is silsile main kii gai apni shikaayat main bataaya he ki choudhary ne uske saath pehali baar saal 2010 main tab balaatkaar kiya, jab 18 saal kii umr main usne los vegas main choudhary kii teacher training classes jwine kii thi
 During his training course those days, his mentor Bikram Chaudhary once showed him a Hindi film and during this he kept giving him his massage for hours and then seeing the opportunity he caught the girl and tortured her
 tab choudhary kii umr koi 64 saal kii rahi hogi
 Mafilolor first raped and then told that after this Chaudhary also apologized to him and promised to make him a champion, but just a week later Chaudhary called him again to meet him alone in a hotel and after reaching there he again Made him a victim of his evil intentions
 iske baad wo kuch saalon tak choudhary se training leti rahi or choudhary vakt be vakt uske saath jabardastee karata rahaa
 Lawler last raped Lawler in February 2013
 haalanki july 2014 tak choudhary se yoga kii talim lene vaali lollar ne kaha ki wo is yon utpeedan se ab tak buree tarah ghabaraai hui thi or isi vajah se ab tak khamosh bani rahi
 However, this is not the first and new case against Chaudhary
 sase pehle bhi uske khilaaf chah alag-alag umr kii ladakiyon ne aise hi ilzaam lagaae hai lekin kamaal kii baat ye he ki itnaa hone ke baavjood choudhary kii shoharat main kami aane kii bajaay vakt ke saath isamen or ijapha hi hua he
 Like Lawler, a girl named Sarah Bogan has filed a complaint in court against Chaudhary alleging rape
 kaan main kuch budbudaya or kar daalaa repasara ne kaha he ki saal 2000 main choudhary ne use tab apana shikaar banaaya, jab wo uske paas yoga seekhney kii gai thi
 Sara is much younger in age than Chaudhary like Lawler
 donon ke bich 38 saalon kaa faasla he lekin iske baavjood sara kii maane to saal 2000 main ek roj choudhary ne pehle uske kaan main budbudate hue kukeshleel baaten kahinor phir uske saath balaatkaar kar daalaa
 Bikram Chaudhary, who has made the world popular with 26 hot yogas, has achieved every worldly thing through yoga, he has not been less in controversies
 yahi vajah he ki choudhary par ye rape kaa pehla or iklauta nahin, balki chatha maamla he
 It is another matter that Bikram Chaudhary has denied this charge on himself as before
 chaar saal kii umr se shuru kiya tha yogachaar saal kii umr se yoga kii shuruyaat karne vaale bikram choudhary kaa janm kolkata main hua tha
 On seeing this, he felt the passion of yoga such that he started practicing yoga for at least 6 hours every day, and as a result of this hard work, Bikram became extremely adept in all the yogasanas
 mahaj 13 saal kii umr main neshnal india yoga championships kaa khitaab apni naam kar puri duniya kaa dhyaan apni ore khinch liya
 Bikram's stars reached such lofty levels that in 1973, US President Nixon, who was suffering from a disease called Felbitis, called him for his treatment
 iske baad bikram america main hi rah gaye or unhone vahaan yoga sikhaane kii shuruyaat kar di
 After this Bikram Chaudhary started Bikram Hot Yoga under his own name and made a brand of Yoga and started Yoga Studios in different countries with the same name
 phir to dekhte hi dekhte wo lakhon-karodon or arabon main khilne lage
 There is also a strange coincidence with Bikram Chaudhary, the world's richest yoga guru, and a litany of controversies
 ittefaq ye ki choudhary jab bhi vivaadon main aae sex kii vajah se hi aae or zyaadaatar maamalon main un par iljaam lagaanevaali ladkiyaan unase umr main aadhe se bhi kam nikaleen
 Many years ago, Chaudhary had revealed himself to possess unlimited sexual power in an interview
 ab canadian mul kii ladki jill lollar ne ab choudhary par shikaayat lagaakar beshak unhen nae sire se surkhiyon main laa diya ho, lekin bikram choudhary pehali baar tab vivaadon main aae jab do saal pehle yani saal 2013 main paanch or ladakiyon ne un par yoga classes ke dauraan hi rape karne ke iljaam lagaae the
 Then 11 cases of rape and excess were registered against Chaudhary
 adaalat ne shuruaati sunwaayee ke baad 11 main se 8 maamalon ko aage kii sunwaayee ke liye manjuuri di thi
 One of these women was Sarah Bowdon, while the other was Meenakshi Jaffa Bodan, who accused Chaudhary of sexual harassment and defamation
 thik in teen ladakiyon kii tarah choudhary kii ek or chaatra larisa anderson ne bhi us par rape kaa aarope lagaaya
 Anderson said that Chaudhary raped her once daily when she went to her house for dinner
 dinar ke baad jab uski patni so gai to choudhary ne anderson ko havas kaa shikaar banaaya
 Still, the whole world is surrounded by accusations of civil harassment and Chaudhary may be facing litigations, but there is no dearth of celebrities among Chaudhary's supporters
 jis shaks ko america aane kii pehali daavat koi or nahin, balki khud america raashtrapati detaa ho, us shaks kii haisiyat kaa andaja lagaana mushkil nahin he
 Be it UK football star David Beckham, famous tennis player Andy Murray, pop singer Madonna, Lady Gaga, dancer Michael Jackson or Hollywood actress Jennifer Aniston, Chaudhary's fans and students are among the few people to meet just once
 The whole world is killed for all

 world cricket main apni shandaar of spin gendbaaji or ‘doosraa’ ke janak pakistan ke dhurandhar purv of spinner sakalan mushtak bharat ke senior of spinner harbhajan singh ke saath kiye ja rahe bartaav or unhen team se baahar rakhane se dukhi hai
 He said that Bhajji is being used and thrown away
 bhajji ko khilne kaa mauka nahin diya ja raharavichandran asvinako ‘vishwastareey gendbaaj’ qaraar dete hue sakalan mushtak kaa maananaa he ki pichley saal tii20 antarrashtriya maichon menharbhajanako ek main bhi khilne kaa mauka nahin dene se is gendbaaj ke aatmavishvaas ke liye acha nahin he
 Pakistani cricketer Saqlain said, "the Indian cricket board and team management's behavior with Harbhajan is not very good
 vah vishwastareey gendbaaj tha or ab bhi vishwastareey gendbaaj he
 The emergence of Ashwin does not mean that you exclude Harbhajan or put him under too much pressure
 ’bhajji ne teen baar vaapasi keatest cricket main 208 or vanade main 288 wicket lene vaale 39 varshiya sakalan ne kaha ki behtareen pradarshan karne vaale khilaadi ko baahar karnaa team ke liye acha udhaaharan nahin hota
 He said, 'you see he has come back three times since he was dropped (in 2001) which means that when you needed him, you took him into the team and when your need was over, you dropped him out
 
 isliye aapane uske liye dabaav bana diya
 You have already ignored his previous achievements
 ’bhajji ko chauthi pasand kaa gendbaaj bana diya gayasakalan ne kaha, ‘vah pehali pasand kaa spinner hona chahie tha or aswin kaa uskaa sahyogi
 Instead you created self doubt on him and have now made him the third or fourth choice spinner
 ’unhone kaha ki jab koi khilaadi vaapasi karata he to uskaa aatmavishvaas kam hota he or use apana sarvshereshth pradarshan karne ke liye aatmavishvaas dilaane kii jarurat hoti he

 Shiv Sena has also quipped after the Central Government reprimanded the Supreme Court over the issue of black money
 shivasena ne modi sarkaar kii ore se sirf teen naam bataae jane kii aalochana kii he
 Party chief Uddhav Thackeray described the Centre's move as 'chane Kurmura'
 uddhav thakare kii party naseehat di he ki centre ko kaala dhan waapas laane kii shuruyaat swadeshi kaale dhan se kerani chahie
 In an editorial in party mouthpiece 'saamana', Uddhav wrote that the Center is now realizing how difficult it is to handle the issue of black money
 haalanki unhone yah bhi likhaa he ki pradhanmantri narendra modi main is mudde ko hal karne kii kshamta he
 Taking a dig at the central government, he wrote, "then (before the election), the anti-black money campaigners claimed that if all the black money deposited in foreign banks came indigenously, then every house of Hindus would go with gold thatch
 abhi tak sarkaar ne keval teen logon ke naam bataae hai
 Looking at this, the whole matter looks like chane-kurmure
 'shivasena pramukh ne likhaa he, 'gujarat ke vyapaaree pankaj lodhiya kaa vaarshik kaarobaar lagbhag 80 karod rupee kaa he
 It is heard that only 50 crore is deposited in his foreign bank account
 yah apane aap main bada majaak he

 unhone yah bhi kaha he ki khud chunaav hi kaale dhan kii gangotri hai

 There is no shame in telling this Chicago mother that she uses cannabis before taking care of her children
 ye maa to maanati he ki bhaang kaa nasha use ek behatar maa banaata he
 Leia Grover is 31 years old
 wo kahati he ki unhen lagata he ki bhaang kaa nasha karke wo apane bacchon ko zyada achche tareeke se sambhaal paati hai
 But he has strict objection that people often judge him wrong because of his habit
 haalanki taarkik rup se ye sahi to nahin he lekin liya kaa kahana he ki bhaang kaa nasha karne ke baad wo apane bacchon ko zyada behatar tareeke se sambhaal paati hai
 Can have more fun with them
 unki jid ko zyada achche tareeke se sambhaal paati hai
 He has also written an article about his unique parenting skills
 acchhee baat ye he ki liya har roj nasha nahin karti hai
 She also avoids doing this even before driving
 unhen apane bacchon kaa puraa khyaal hota he isliye wo unke saamne bhi nasha nahin karti hai
 She only gets intoxicated when she starts feeling stressed while handling her children
 ek chota sa brake lekar wo unase dur ho jaati hai or nasha karke waapas laut aati hai
 He first drank cannabis at the age of 15
 uske baar-baar dhire-dhire unhen isaki lat lag gaior ye unhen pasand aane laga
 She says that she did not consume it for many years in between, but one day when she was alone at home and her children were crying and screaming, she was under a lot of stress
 uske baad unhone apane us box ko tatola jise unhone lambey samay se nahin chuaa tha
 After taking a puff from it, all their stress subsided
 unka kahana he ki nasha karne ke baad jab wo apane bacchon ke paas lautin to kaaphi sukun main thim or unhen koi tanaav bhi nahin tha
 They believe that after they get intoxicated by cannabis, they stop making a difference with the noise, screams and filthiness of their children
 aisa karne ke baad wo tanaav nahin leti hai or apane bacchon kaa zyada achche se khyaal rakh paati hai

 First advice: Politics in economic figures, trouble surers always shine the image of the country under their leadership, but political figures are dangerous in economic statistics
 satta main aane ke baad modi sarkaar, jidipi ke aankadon kii gananaa badali or achaanak bhartiya arthvyavastha kii growth 5-6 fisadi kii jagah 7-7
 5 percent started appearing
 duniya bhar ke visheshgyon ko is par shaq hua kyonki jamini hakeekat isse bilkul alag he
 However, instead of clarifying these figures, the government started claiming that India is beating China in its growth
 samajhnaa jaruri he ki bharat kaa samgr jidipi china ke jidipi kaa keval 20 fisad he
 If China grows at a rate of five per cent every year, then in less than four years, it will add an economy like India
 jis tarah india shining kii nai koshishen visheshgyon ke gale nahin utar raheen, thik usee tarah china ke jidipi aankade duniya ke liye paheli rahe hai
 Compared to the debt crisis of Europe and America, China is more scared because there is no transparency in the statistics of this country, so the risk assessment is difficult
 yaad kiijie china ke pradhanmantri lee kekuang kaa 2010 kaa bayaan jab unhone kaha tha ki “aarthik aankade maanav nirmit hai, isliye bharosemand nahin hai
 Suspicion on China's GDP figures began after the 1998 East Asia crisis when all of China's neighboring economies did not fall but showed a growth of around 8 per cent
 haal ke varshon main bhi audyogic utpaadan ke aankade china kii tej growth ke daawey kii chugali khate rahe hai
 Today, when China is in trouble, the most questions of credit are being raised on its economic data, in which there has always been a temper of politics
 duusari naseehatah bank kamjor to jokhim bhariagar sarkaar kii taiyaariyon main tadbradili nahin ai to jald hi 1980 kii tarj par lone meley waapas hone vaale hai
 The central government is about to launch a loan disbursement campaign through Mudra Bank
 taiyaari to yah he ki kuch chote karj bagaiyr jamaanat ke de die jaaen
 This is frightening, especially at a time when it has become difficult to recover 12 paise for every rupee of loans disbursed by banks and the size of the total loans stranded has crossed Rs 3 lakh crore
 desh main nivesh kii gaadi to thap he kyonki sasta karj growth kii buniyadi shart he or rigerv bank kii taraf se byaaj dar kam hone ke baavjood fanse hue karjon se laden bank karj sasta karne ko taiyaar nahin hai
 The Modi government was expected to restructure the banks and solve the problem of stranded debts
 sarkaar ko jab bakaayaa karjon kii vasuuli kaa saahas dikhaanaa chahie tha ki zyaadaatar bade karj rajnatik rasookh vaali companiyon ke naam hai, tab “lone melon” kii shuruyaat china jaisi hi galati he
 China has seen the spectacle of growth by blowing its banking
 china main kareeb 15 saal pehle kul bakaayaa karj ek kharab dollar tha jo ab 25 kharab dollar par he
 China's state-owned banks disbursed loans under political pressure that were used in real estate or unproductive industrial investment
 china kaa bhawan nirmaan dantakthaon main tabdeel ho chukaa he jo kareeb 1
 3 billion dollars in debt and is about to burst
 real estate kii maang or audyogic niryaat ghatane ke baad china ke bainkon ne kism-kism kii micro finance skiimon or share bazaar main niveshkon ko karj dena shuru kar diya or karj kaa cancer udyog se lekar sheyaron tak fail gaya
 India's banking is certainly not as bad as China, but after the formation of the Modi government, the first warnings of danger in India have come about banking
 antarrashtriya mudra kosh ne april main apni ek report main bharat ke bainkon ko rus ke baad sabase khatarnaak sthiti main bataaya he
 Almost all the experts believe that debt-laden Indian banks are like time bombs which can rip the entire system at anytime
 china or bharat aarthik sudhaaron ke maamle main do vipareet dishaao main chal rahe hai
 China is trying to make its industrial economy into a consumption-based economy, while India wants to convert the consumption-based economy into a production-based economy
 lekin yah dekhnaa achraj bharaa he ki china taaja sankat ke baad jab apaardarshee arthvyavastha ko thik karne main laga he, tab bharat ke achche khaase or bharosemand aarthik tantra ko jaan-boojhkar apaardarshita or siyasat se pradooshit kyon kiya kaa ja rahaa he
 Prime Minister, whether the crisis of China is an opportunity for India or not, it will decide the time, but the Chinese art of inviting the crisis is definitely a pretext for India, which can be explosive to ignore

 tippaniyan He was referring to Mayukh Mahar, Himesh Kharwal and Manoj Tiwari who hold cabinet level positions in the government
 unhone kaha, ‘‘yadi unka mukhyamantri main koi vishwaas nahin he to unhen pad par bane rahane kaa koi adhikaar nahin he
 '' mahaar rajya yojana ayog ke upaadhyaksh hai jabaki kharkawaal or manoj tiwari sansadeey sachiv hai
 Interestingly, he represents the assembly constituency located in the Kumaon region which is considered to be the stronghold of Rawat and who had hoped to become the chief minister

 After this, the US reduced it from 35 percent to 21 percent
 france ne bhi 2022 main ise 33 fisadi se ghataakar 25 fisadi karne kaa plan banaaya he
 The corporate tax rate in India is around 35 per cent after imposing various surcharges and cesses
 1997 se 2019 tak ausatan corporate tex 34
 94 percent
 2001 main yah adhiktam 38
 95 per cent was recorded, while in 2011 the minimum was 32

 Under the income tax, large domestic companies and foreign companies are obliged to pay corporate tax
 gharelu companiyaan apni kul aamadani par tex detii hai jabaki videshi companiyaan sirf un raashiyon par tex detii hai jo unhone bharat main arjeet kii he
 The fourth year of the roadmap announced by Jaitley is coming to an end
 corporate kii taraf bad-chadhakar maang kii ja rahi he ki corporate tex ghataya jaae
 The Finance Minister will work on the possibilities of reducing corporate tax for domestic and foreign companies
 haalanki, sarkaar kii taraf se aisa koi sanket nahin he ki rajasav kii sthiti acchhee he or corporate tex ghataane kii maang ko puraa kiya ja sake

 By the time of the film, the film had almost become a headache
 ekadam se lite jali thi thodi raahat mili
 But there was a fun thing to be seen in the interval
 sensor board ke adhyaksh pehlaaj nihalaani kaa naam aayaa or meraa desh mahaan shuru ho gaya
 It was a video prepared by Nihalanike to promote Prime Minister Narendra Modi, describing his and his government's achievements
 'baapu-modi' shabd bhi khub prayog hua
 Nihalani knew that there was a hype about 'prem Ratan Dhan Payo' and a large number of people would also come to see it, perhaps because he introduced this song with the film
 chaliye acha he
 Anyway, Salman Khan has done kite flying during 'jai Ho' with Prime Minister Narendra Modi (who was the prime ministerial candidate at the time) in 2014, so it was no surprise that this video of Nihalani with Salman's film was not surprising
 lekin is gane ke liye yah koun-sa mauka he, samaj hi nahin aayaa kyonki abhi-abhi bihar chunaav ke nattejey aakar hate hai or endie kii karaari haar hui he

 dekhen video Love is a beautiful feeling that can only be felt
 lekin kya aapane kabhi sochaa he ki pyaar karne se aapkaa vajan bhi bad saktaa he
 Yes, it is not us but this has been confirmed in a study
 australia kii 'central queenland uniwarsity' kii ek study ke mutabik, jab log kisi ke saath pyaar ke rishte main bandhe hote hai yaa unako kisi se pyaar hota he to unka vajan badhane kii sambhavana zyada hoti he
 Researchers have included more than 15,000 people in this study
 unhone study main shaamil purush or mahilaon ke body maas index (BMI) kii tulana karne ke baad nattejey ghoshit kiye
 Explain that both singles and couples of different lifestyles have been included in the study
 partner se nahin chaahate brallep, padhein ye 5 baaten
 
 
 This is the reason for weight gain - During the study, researchers found that love and weight gain are closely related to each other
 darasal, jab log kisi ke saath rishte main hote hai to kuch samay ke baad unamem apane partner ko impress karne kii bhaavana khatm ho jaati he
 Due to not paying attention to themselves, inadvertently people start gaining weight
 - vajan badhane kaa ek mukhya kaaran yah bhi he ki jo log pyaar ke rishte main hote hai wo log gym jaakar eksrasij karne ke bajaae apana zyaadaatar samay partner ke saath ghar main rahakar hi gujaarna pasand karte hai
 The changed lifestyle is also an important reason for weight gain
 apane partner kaa test lene ke liye jarur karen ye ek kaam- aksar jab log pyaar main hote hai to wo behad khush rahete hai or agar rishta nayaa ho to yah khushi dabl ho jaati he
 Let us know, when we are happy, then the happy hormones oxytocin and dopamine are released in our body
 in happy hormone se chocolate, wine or zyada calories vaali chijen khaane kii ichha hoti he, jo vajan badhaane kaa kaam karti hai
 Are women cricket players being sexually abused in Uttarakhand? Are incidents like rape happening to them? If the sports minister is indeed true, then nothing could be more unfortunate for Devbhoomi
 uttarakhandke khel mantri aravind pandeya ne cricket sanghon ko chetavanee di he ki wo sudhar jaaen
 It has also said that they have complete proof against all the unions
 khel mantri ye bhi kaha ki cricket sanghon se jude kuch log hai jo khel ke naam par mahila cricket khilaadiyon kaa jivan barbaad kar rahe hai
 a lawsuit will be filed against such people under Section 376
 agar vaaki mahila cricket khilaadiyon ke saath aisa hua he yaa aisa ho rahaa he to mantri ke saath hi mukhyamantri trivendra singh ravat ko bhi turant ection lenaa chahie
 Because for the sports world this incident is no less than a black chapter
 jis desh ke pradhanmantri beti bachaao or beti padhaao kaa naaraa dete hai, usee desh main aisi ghatnashrmasarkarne vaali he
 If there is evidence, then why is the government still silent? The way the sports minister has openly spoken about sexual exploitation or rape of women players
 saath hi saboot kii baat bhi kahi he to phir aisi kya vajah he ki karrwai ke liye sirf kaha ja rahaa he
 Why action has not been taken so far mantri pad jaae to jaae par nahi chalane duungaa gundgardikhel mantri ne ajtak se baat karte hue ye bhi saafe kar diya ki mujhe chaahe kisi bhi had tak janaa pade, main jaaoongaa
 i will not let anyone play with the future of Uttarakhand
 saath hi kisi kii gundgardee chalane nahin duungaa
 Arvind Pandey also clarified that it is a matter of great regret that due to some fall in the lower category people, the promising players of Uttarakhand are illuminating the name of another state by not playing from Uttarakhand
 desh bhale hi meraa ho, lekin rajya kaa naam bhi roshan hona chahie
 Therefore, it makes it clear that if i do not improve my Uttarakhand's cricket future, then i have no right to be the Sports Minister
 main bina der kiye apane khel mantri pad se istipha de duungaa
 After all, why are such situations? It is important to note that for the last 17 years, the cricket world in Uttarakhand had to be deprived of the recognition of BCCI in its own state
 kyonki devbhumi uttarakhand main ek nahin, balki kai aise cricket sangh hai, jinhone apni alag se association bana rakhi he
 Because of this, conflict has been seen continuously in the last years
 shaayad yahi vajah he kii khel mantri ko baqayada sakht rukh akhriyaar karnaa padaa

 If we look at the figures of india-china trade, it is clear that China's penetration in India is much deeper than firecrackers
 china se pataakhon kaa aayaat 10 lakh dollar kaa bhi nahin hoga

 5 arab dollar), chemicals (6 arab dollar), fertiligers (3
 2 billion dollars), steel (2
 3 arab dollar) kaa he
 In 2016-17, we imported about $ 72 billion from China
 2015-16 main ye 61 arab dollar kaa tha
 After China, India's largest imports are from the US, Saudi Arabia and Emirates
 lekin china se hone vaala aayaat in teenon deshon se hone vaale aayaat se adhik he

 90 ke dashak main karypalika ke kilaaf shuru hai nyaayik sakriyata 2014 ke saal main usee karypalika ke saamne apana mukammal bachaav tak nahin kar saki
 In this examination, the executive will take back his lost control or the judiciary has become even better, which law scholars will debate for a long time
 kendriya kanoon mantri ravishankar prasad ne rashtriya nyaayik ayog ke liye samvidhan sanshodhan bill pesh karte hue use aitihaasik bataaya
 Today is a historic day for democratic beings who keep an eye on constitutional laws and institutions
 kis rup main aitihaasik he, yah bahes kaa vishay ho saktaa he
 The appointment of judges of the Supreme Court and 24 High Courts will form a Commission for Transfer and Promotion, abbreviated as NJAC, which will be headed by the National Judicial Appointments Commission as the Chief Justice of India
 kanoon mantri, supreme court ke do varisht jaj, do pratishthit naagarik iske sadsy honge
 The terms of who will be distinguished members, how to become and how long will be given
 engiesi ko sanvaidhanik darja diya gaya he, taaki sarkaar isamen koi pherbadal na kar sake
 If 2 out of 6 members of the NGAC do not agree on any candidate, then the appointment will not take place
 raashtrapati engiesi kaa prastaav punarvichaar ke liye lautaa sakate hai, lekin panel ne sarvasammati se prastaav bheja to raashtrapati ko maananaa hoga
 Only the senior judge of the Supreme Court will become the Chief Justice, but he will not attend the meeting of the Appointments Committee
 agar aaj loksabhaa main kanoon mantri ravishankar prasad ko bolte suna ho to aapane unke bheetar ke vakil or rajaneta ko ek duusare se khub hode karte dekha hoga
 Made a good speech
 nae ayog ke do naagarik sadasyon kii niyukti jo cameti karegi uskaa ek sadsy netaa vipaksh ho yaa loksabhaa main sabase badi party kaa netaa hoga yani kanoon mantri ne congress kii pareshaani bhi kam kar di
 This provision will also be important for appointments from Lokpal to Election Commission
 kanoon mantri ne kaha ki nayaa bill sansad or nyaaypalika kii shaktiyon ke samaan bantwaare or aadar par tikaa he, magar nae ayog main pradhanta nyaaypalika kii bani rahe, iske liye pramukh to chif justise honge hi, do jaj bhi honge
 Also, the member for the appointment of a committee for the appointment of two persons will also be the Chief Justice
 ayog jo prastaav bhejega sarkaar sweekaar karegi
 Throughout the speech, Ravi Shankar Prasad was cautious about whether any of his talk should be construed as an interference in the jurisdiction of the judiciary
 isliye unhone is baat kaa vistaar se zikr kiya ki aaj is bill ko pesh karne se pehle bees saalon main chaar baar samvidhan sanshodhan ke prayaas hue hai, saat baar vibhinn cametiyon ne vistaar se suzav die hai
 The Law Minister quoted the constitution maker, Dr
 Ambedkar, as to how he was not in favor of giving supreme authority to the President, the Chief Justice of India and Parliament in the matter of appointment of judges
 saal 1993 ke supreme court ke jis faisle se colegium system kii shuruyaat hoti he
 The statement of late Justice JS Verma, who gave that decision, was also mentioned in which he said that the judiciary misunderstood his decision
 ravishankar prasad kehete hai ki 1950 se 1993 tak jajon kii niyukti kii puraani vyavastha ne bahut acha kaam kiya
 Today there is no judge before the Collegium
 main sawaal poochta hum ki aaj viaar krishna ayyar jaise jaj kyon nahin hai
 Why is there no judge like HR Khanna? Where are judges like Bijan Mukherjee, VVN Bose SR Das? There were shortcomings in that system, so did legend
 jab ravishankar prasad ye udhaaharan de rahe the to mujhe dhyaan aa rahaa tha ki centre yaa rajya sarkarein apane panel par vakeelon kii niyukti peshewar tareeke se karti he yaa raajnneetik pasand ke aadhaar par
 Why not make it transparent as well
 main is yogya to nahin hum par kya hamaare kanoon mantri yah kah rahe hai ki maujuuda colegium system main yani 1993 ke baad se koi aisa jaj hi nahin bana, jiskaa naam liya ja sake
 Has the Supreme Court not given historic verdicts since 1993? tu ji ghotaale se lekar anya ghotaalon main netaaon se lekar udyogpatiyon ko jail bhejne kii daastaan kya is system main darj nahin he
 The Law Minister gives another example, Jabalpur High Court Chief Justice GP Singh, whose book is cited, could not appear in the Supreme Court
 is par sochna hoga
 The Law Minister did not mention any of the allegations or examples of former Justice Katju, but in response to his own examples one can ask whether those in the Supreme Court became judges who were less capable than Chief Justice GP Singh
 jab 2012 main supreme court ke purv chif justise esech kapadia ritair hue tab forbs patrika ne likhaa tha 'justise kapadia pilgrim of justise' yani nyaay kaa tirthayatri
 The Hindu wrote in September 2012 that Kapadia's term would be remembered for targeting corruption at high ranks
 india today ne likhaa ki nyaaypalika main bharose ko behaal kar justise kapadia ritair ho gaye
 DNA wrote 'A Chief Justice of India Who Breeds Integrity'
 yah bhi dhyaan main rakhiyegaa ki kuch chif justise par sidhe yaa apratyaksh rup se aarope bhi lage
 In recent times, Justice Katju referred to several incidents of corruption in the judiciary and in many cases stated that the Chief Justice, as the head of the Collegium, did not take steps
 ek maamle main unhone purv pradhan nyaayadhish kapadia kaa bhi zikr kiya he
 Public interest litigation against the collegium system was heard in the Supreme Court on Monday
 is system ke bachaav main maujuuda chif justise aar em lodha ne kaha ki jaanboojh kar ek abhiyaan ke tahat nyaaypalika kii chhavi kharaab kii ja rahi he
 i belong to the first batch of judges appointed from this collegium system and Justice Nariman will be the last judge
 agar colegium system fail ho gaya he, to ham sab fail ho gaye hai
 Soon the collegium system will become history
 kya nayaa system wo sab itihaas banane main sakasham hoga jo kathith rup se colegium se nahin bana
 You know that since 1993, the Collegium of the Supreme Court appoints judges
 ab rashtriya nyaayik niyukti ayog karegaa

 But looking at the Chinese people outside the window to see those people as something strange and satirizing them in their own language (which i realized from their laughter) was a sign of Asian narrow thinking

 The diplomatic dispute in the case deepened when Malaysia recalled its ambassador from North Korea and summoned North Korea's ambassador Kang Chola to reprimand, but Kang retaliated

 'north Korea also criticized Malaysia for conducting a post-mortem without its approval

 The Ministry of External Affairs said, "the Ministry insists that the death occurred under mysterious circumstances on Malaysia's land, so it becomes the responsibility of the Government of Malaysia to conduct an investigation to find out the cause of death

 warden kii madad se jiromile nivasee indrajit ne uske saath teen baar rape kiya
 Not only this, he was also threatened to kill on opening his mouth
 warden or indrajit kii ore se dhamkee milane par vah 28 sitambar ko raksha grih se faraar ho gai thi
 The child is pregnant for three months
 rajkeey uttar raksha grih main bhi ladkiyaan surakshit nahin hai
 The girl was also sexually abused, the case was revealed when the victim girl underwent a medical examination
 sadar hospital main hui medical jaanch main ladki garbhvatee pai gai
 The revelation of the case created panic in the administrative office
 pita or bhai kii havas kaa shikaar bhi ho chuki he peeditapita or bhai dwaara lagaataar yon shoshan kiye jane se ajiz aakar dilli kii rahane vaali ladki soni (kaalpanik naam) ne apana ghar chhod nai duniya basaani chaahi, lekin kismat ne use ek baar phir dagaa diya
 Soni left home after escaping the lust of her loved ones and fled to Maharashtra
 maharashtra child line ne use patna ke hawaale kar diya
 Patna handed over Soni to Muzaffarpur's North Defense Home a year ago

 child line is khulaase ke baad bal kalyaan samiti ko likhit taur par peedita ko waapas bulaane kaa patr diya
 But the Child Welfare Committee neither made proper arrangements for the victim to stay anywhere nor lodged any complaint in the matter with the police

 Escape from North Defense Home in the name of leave of warden
 jile ke varisht adhikariyon kaa is maamle main chuppi sadhana

 Just before the Gujarat assembly elections, the Congress won a major strategic victory
 gujarat main lambey samay se dikh rahe yuva asantosh kii pahchaan ban chuke hardik patel, jignesh mewaani or alpesh thakor kaa samarthan congress upaadhyaksh yuva netaa rahul gandhi ko miltaa najar aa rahaa he
 It remains to be seen whether the people of Gujarat take these four young leaders - Rahul, Hardik, Alpesh and Jignesh - hands-on
 chaaron yuva netaaon ne modi ke gujarat model main laga di he sendhapradhanmantri narendra modi apane grih rajya gujarat ke vikaas kaa model pesh kar desh kii satta main aae
 For the BJP, which has made Vikas the slogan of every election campaign, the Gujarat model will be the support for the future
 lekin beete kuch maheenon ke dauraan in chaaron yuva netaaon ne jis tarah gujarat menaarakshan, sharabbandi, berogari or dalit utpeedanjaisi samasyaon kaa pitara kholaa he, usase modi ke is gujarat model main send najar aane lagi he
 Hardik Patel got a new identity not only in the state but through the country through the Hardik Patel Patel Anamat Movement, which emerged as the messiah of the Patidars
 ahmedabad ke viramgaanv main janmen hardik abhi 24 saal ke hi hai, lekin unki reliyon main jis tarah lakhon kii sankhya main patidaar samudaay juta, usase gujarat kii raajnneeti main unki takat kaa andaja lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Most importantly, Patidars constitute 18% of the population in Gujarat and the Patel community has influence in 70 of the 182 assembly seats in the state
 pichley do dashak se rajya kaa patel samudaay bijepi kaa paramparaagat voter rahaa he, jo philhal naaraaz mana ja rahaa he
 As a result, in the district panchayat elections held in 2015, the Congress won 8 out of 11 of Saurashtra and the BJP had to face a crushing defeat
 una se dalit utpeedan ke khilaaf uthi aawaaj ke pratik bane jigneshgujarat ke una main oonchi jati ke logon dwaara dalit samudaay ke yuvakon kii berahami se pitayee ne gujarat main dalit utpeedan kii ore puure desh kaa dhyaan aakarshith kiya
 Jignesh is a lawyer and social worker by profession
 oona main goraksha ke naam par daliton kii pitayee ke khilaaf hue andolan jignesh ne netritv kiya
 Jignesh did the work that the Dalit society wanted to be free for centuries
 daliton ke haq main jignesh dwaara shuru kiye gaye 'aazaadee kooch andolan' se jis tarah daliton ke alaava muslim samudaay ekajute hua, usne nishchit taur par bijepi ke maathe par chintaa kii lakeeren khinch deen
 Significantly, Gujarat has seven percent Dalit population
 obisi cheharaa alpesh ne milaayaa congress se haathgujrat main 60 se zyada siton par acha prabhaav rakhane vaale obisi samudaay ke nae pratinidh banakar ubhare alpesh ne shanivaar ko dilli main congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi se mulaakaat kii or jald hi congress ko samarthan dene kaa elaan kar diya he
 Alpesh was identified with the Thakore army three years ago
 alpesh ne gujarat main sharabbandi ke baavjood har jagah aasaani se milane vaali desi sharaab ko bada mudda banaaya
 The Thakor army, led by Alpesh, started 'janata Raid' at local liquor stores in central and north Gujarat
 alpesh ne nasha mukti abhiyaan ke saath gujarat main badi sankhya main yuvakon ke berozegaar hone ke mudde ko bhi saath le liya
 Alpesh also expanded the scope of Thakor army and added the entire OBC society to it
 gujarat main obisi samaaj kii 146 jatiyaan hai, jo 60 se zyada siton par apana asar rakhti hai
 Alpesh has done booth level management in about 80 countryside assembly seats in Gujarat
 pichley kai chunaav se obisi matadaata bijepi ke saath rahe hai, lekin kuch samay se obisi samudaay naaraaz he
 Alpesh is in the mood to cash this resentment
 badla-badla he rahul kaa andamb baat karte hai congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi kii
 The Congress has so far not won any election due to Rahul Gandhi's leadership or his charisma
 lekin beete kuch dinon se rahul kaa bilkul nayaa cheharaa dekhne ko mil rahaa he
 His rallies in Gujarat are not only attracting huge crowds, but his speeches have also brought new finesse
 rahul gandhi ab 23 oktober ko gujarat main alpesh kii jansabha main alpesh ke saath manch saajha karte najar aaenge
 In the coming days, when Rahul will share the stage with these young leaders of Gujarat, it will be a matter of seeing how the people of Gujarat take them
 congress na sirf in yuva netaaon ke jariye gujarat main vaapasi karnaa chaah rahi he, balki gujarat ke jariye vah rahul gandhi kii raajnneetik image bhi chamakaana chaah rahi he
 It has been more than a decade since i began my intensive travels during elections in different and remote parts of the country, in which i occasionally went to neighboring countries
 vahaan se ikattha anubhavon ko main apane stambh 'deevaaren bolti hai’ main likhata rahaa hum
 As the name suggests, these are the prayers written on the walls
 inamen aksar bhittichitra, sinboard, hording, vigyapanon kii baat hoti he jo aapako kisi badalte hue ilaake ko samajhane main madad karte hai
 All this together, however, creates an idiom that you need to get around by adopting old-fashioned reporting methods, reading, talking to people and keeping your senses open and letting the experiences come
 is shrinkhalaa main samooche hindibhashi kshetra, uttar, purab, pashchim or dakshin main hue badlaavon ko samaybaddh tareeke se darj kiya gaya he or sabhi ahm rajya iske daayre main aa chuke hai
 The only exception to this is Delhi where i live and vote
 sawaal uthta he ki kya dilli ek ahm rajya he? vah rajya bhi he kya? iskaa beshkeemtee lutiuns vaala hissaa centre sarkaar ke adheen he
 Its land and police (the two things by which every chief minister exerts influence) are also under the center
 loksabhaa main dilli sirf saat saansad chunakar bhejti he jo sankhya pados ke chote-se rajya haryana main sansadeey siton ke aadhe se kuch zyada he jabaki padosi uttar pradesh ke dasven hisse se bhi kam he
 Most of the urban power and responsibility within Delhi is under the elected municipal corporations
 is tarah se dilli kii chuni hui sarkaar ek kism se bonsai he, jiske paas ek sarkaar jitani sari baadhyataaen to hai lekin jisaki pahunch or takat ek vaastavik rajnatik ikai ke jitani nahin he
 Still, it is the government of Delhi that is why it is important, as once there was a song playing in AIR - Delhi is the heart of India
 
 
 
 In the past, what was applicable to intellectualism and ideas, today it is applicable to political power
 masalan, ham kabhi kaha karte the ki bengal aaj jo sochataa he, bharat vahi kal sochataa he
 On the same lines, we can say that the one who rules Delhi today will rule India tomorrow
 jaahir he, is muhaavarey main samay ke saath hone vaale badlaav beshak darj honge
 With the exception of only one exception from the mid-seventies to today, we find that whichever party has won the election of the students' union of Delhi University, Delhi has won most of the seven Lok Sabha seats
 aisa bhi shaayad hi hua ho ki jis party ko dilli main jeet mili, vah bharat par raaj nahin kar saki
 Even in 1999, 2004, 2009 and now 2014, the same straightforward trend has been maintained
 ab hamen isamen ek atirikt shart jo jodani hogi vah arvind kejariwal kii aam aadmi party kaa ubhaar he jo bijepi ke saath sidhe mukaable main he
 It would be absurd to say that the trend of the past will repeat itself and if the Aam Aadmi Party wins in Delhi, it will rule India in the future
 yah jarur ho saktaa he ki vah jeet ke baad khud main bada badlaav kare or ek vaikalpik rashtriya takat ke rup main khud ko sthapit karte hue madhyamargi vam vaicharik lokapriy spes se congress ko bedakhal kar daale tathaa narendra modi ke liye kahin zyada bada sankat khadaa kar de
 If BJP wins, it will give power to Modi's power, it will confirm that Modi's wave is intact and then they will be able to overcome even more powerful challenges than Congress
 dilli itani ahm he or kejariwal itane kathor pratidwandvi hai ki unhone modi ko apni ranneeti or sameekaran badalane ko baadhya kar diya he
 This is the first time under the leadership of Modi that instead of seeking votes in his name, his party is contesting in front of a chief minister
 isse doharaa uddeshy sadhegaa
 For one, Delhi has got a candidate with a personal reputation equal to Kejriwal as Kiran Bedi
 duusare, pratikul sthiti aane par modi ke paas vikalp apnaane kii gunjaaish bhi maujuud he
 If Delhi had been on the broad lines of national politics, it would have been easier to assess it
 tab modi ke liye yah chunauti bhi nahin pesh kar paati
 In every election held in the last 15 months, including the election of four states, the voters of Delhi have voted overwhelmingly for Modi and his party, irrespective of their caste or ethnicity
 aaj kii dilli main zyaadaatar pravasi hindibhashi rajyon or haryana se hai or kuch puraane punjabi yahaan rahete hai
 It is also the richest state in the country in terms of per capita income and is at the forefront of the best roads (one can even say the least bad), metro, tens of thousands of buses, green area, schools, colleges
 dilli main haalanki pahchaan koi zyada myne nahin rakhti he
 This is not because the urbanization here has given rise to an inclusive environment but it is because the economy of Delhi determines the economy here
 dukandaaree par palata shahardilli kii sahi tasviir khinchne ke liye suketu mehta jaisi drushti or vivarnaatmak takat chahie taaki is par ek moti kitaab likhi ja sake
 i am limited to just looking at the writings written on the walls, so the pillar in front of Akshardham metro station in East Delhi is enough for me to open my knowledge eye so that i understand why Delhi is different
 is khambhe par ek develper kaa vigyaapan laga he jo dukaane bechata he or jis par ek sandesh likhaa he: rupaya pedo par nahin ugta, dukaanon main ugta he
 As you enter the poorest Jamnapar area in East Delhi, go through traffic and crowd of people and go and talk to the vendors of vegetable, ice cream, pakoras, property agents and small shopkeepers and auto drivers
 is ilaake main takreeban sabhi log daftar ke baad kuch na kuch bechate hai
 They do jobs during the day but earn less than that
 parivaar, badhate hue bachche, shaadi-byaah or behatar jindagi bitaane kii adamya mahatvakanksha ke liye zyada paisa chahie
 This is not possible in one way
 sarkari naukariyon main lage tamaam log, yahaan tak ki chaparasi, daftari or chaukeedaar bhi kuch na kuch nakad lekar ghar aate hai
 This capital is a corrupt city where there is a cost to carry a file, open a door and talk to someone on the phone
 yahaan property ke dhandhe main lage log bataaenge ki nichle or madhyam darje ke sarkari karmchaaree kitne bhrasht hai
 According to a reliable estimate, around five lakh government employees get Rs 5,000 in their pocket daily
 ausatan lekar ghar lautate hai
 They have to spend this money but they cannot take it to the bank
 ve apni jeevanstyli bhi nahin badha sakate varanaa logon ko shaq ho jayega
 Among those who survive, there are either a handful of honest public servants or private-sector workers with low salaries — these people help others to spend that cash
 yah paisa khaane-pine main, manoranjan main, nae-nae fansy phone main or beauty parloron main khapata he
 If you go to the lower and lower middle class areas of Delhi, you will find that every person is a shopkeeper here
 har ghar se ek dhandha chal rahaa he—khaane-pine se lekar darjigiri or tution se lekar homeopathy tak
 Delhi is a double income city and this second income does not come from bribery or money, but from domestic enterprise
 dilli main paisa isi kaarobaar or dukandaaree se pravaahit hota he or iske graahak ve log hai jinaki aay nakadi main he
 Now you must understand why that pillar is eye-opening: money does not grow on trees, it grows in shops
 dilli main udyog yaa sansaadhan kam hai
 The biggest source of cash here is the government and the biggest occupation here is shopkeeping
 babugiri or muftgiriuhi vajah he ki dilli kii sanchaalak takatein hai lobh, mahatvakanksha or ek aakraamak, khurdari samvedanheenata jo desh ke kisi or shahar main nahin milti
 a fourth-grade staff leader living in Mandavali in the eastern corner of Delhi says, "sirji, we belong to the city of freedom fighters
 ” uske shabdkosh main swatantraaa senaanee kaa matlab vah vyakti he jo har cheez muft chahta ho, parivahan se lekar bijli, shiksha, pani or yahaan tak ki vaai-fi bhi
 The reason for Kejriwal's rise in Delhi is that he has read the minds of the poor people of Delhi well: the value of money for the voters here is the same as that which has been identified for the voters elsewhere
 inhen har maal yaa seva sarkaar se muft main chahie
 That is why his idea of free wifi in the entire city is excellent
 beshak ve iske or phaayde ginate hai: jaise ki har mahila ke mobile phone par wiphoi se judaa ek aplication hoga taaki vah kisi bhi khatre kii ashanka main sabase kareebi police stesan ko soochna de sake
 In this, however, it has been assumed that every woman on the road, transport and at work will have a mobile phone
 vaise dilli koi garib shahar nahin he, isliye yah muft ke naam par lubhaane vaali raajnneeti bhi nahin he
 The Congress first understood this when it partnered with the mafia to cater to this dose of voters, giving crores of people the opportunity to loot government land on which illegal colonies were settled and where more than half of Delhi lives today is
 dilli kaa 2008 kaa chunaav congress inhen coloniyon ko niyamit karne ke vaade par jeet pai thi, lekin 2013 main usne koi taaja koshish nahin kii jab log bijli, pani or parivahan kii badhati keemton se trast ho chuke the
 They believe that the minimum price for these services should be recovered
 kejariwal is baat ko samajh gaye, lihaaja vot batorne ke liye unhone sasti bijli, muft pani, shiksha, har parivaar ke liye ek makaan kaa naaraa de daalaa
 Free Wifi is the slogan to woo the upper section in this episode
 unki hordigon par likhaa he: degree, aay, wiphoi
 This means that in today's Delhi, bread, cloth and house means education, money and communication communication
 kejariwal sabase pehle is rahasy ko khol paae isiilie aaj ve itani majboot chunauti bane hue hai
 In the business of popular politics, he has left the old leaders like Congress far behind
 ab congress gharon main muft siver conection dene kaa vaada kar rahi he
 Compare this with degree, income and wifi, the difference will be understood
 paisa agar dilliwaalon kii pahchaan kaa sabase bada paimaana he to vah paisa hi he jo dilli ko bhugol or vaastu ke lihaaj se baantta bhi he
 South Delhi is of nobles and nobles
 dakshin-madhya dilli sabase amir or taqatvar he
 West Delhi is rich with only money and hunger for money
 iske baad baari aati he nirdhan uttari or purvi dilli kii
 Amidst all this, there is a tired old Delhi, which is on the verge of collapse
 dilli main mumbai ke hisaab se jhuggiyaan nahin hai
 Most of its votes are occupied by Kejriwal
 ve khud maanate hai ki dilli main pachaas lakh ke kareeb jhuggiyaan hai haalanki vaastavik paimaane par jinhen yahaan jhuggi mana jaataa rahaa he or jinhen je
 J
 colony kaha jaataa rahaa he, unki sankhya isaki aadhi hi hogi
 Apart from these, there is a plethora of illegal colonies in Delhi — from Sangam Vihar in South Delhi to Burari in North Delhi — and some are just legitimate colonies to name, such as mandavali-vinod Nagar in East Delhi
 maximum sab-citiapane desh main or pakistan main deevaaron par likhi ibaaraton kii talash main maine badi betkalluphi ke saath apane phone par tasviren khichin hai taaki apane elstritor ko chitra banane main madad kar sakuun, or badale main is kautuhal se zyada kharaab or koi pratikriya mujhe nahin mili he: yah koun murkh he jo hordigon, diwaar par bane chitron kii tasviren khinch laata he or yah to koi japani bhi nahin lagata? lekin apni dilli main tasviir khinchne ke liye har baar phone uthaate hi log mujhe andeh se dekhne lag jate hai
 Nearly everyone has illegally constructed or expanded their homes and is surrounded by concerns that i am not gathering evidence for a government official or a court-appointed oversight committee
 jameen ko lekar ghatiya shashan or congress-style kii chunavi raajnneeti ne shahar kii teen-chauthai aabaadi ko kisi na kisi rup main avaidh kii tarah rahane par majaboor kar diya he
 So, there are some very illegal areas - from the poorest Burari to the richest military farms
 ardh-vaid gaiyr-abhijatya tabaka dilli ke vishaal nichle varg kaa nirmaan karata he or vah kejariwal se bahut prem karata he
 Illegal colonies of Delhi are in a sense the answer to Mumbai's slums
 aam jhuggi bastiyon se behatar lekin avaidh, suvidhaon se maharoom or mafiaon dwaara sanchalit
 For their easy convenience, we give them the name of super-slum
 dilli ke zyaadaatar hisson main, jaise ki purv ke ilaakon main vibhinn aarthik varg kandhe se kandhaa milakar rahete hai
 Those rich in these imprison themselves in cages — putting their balconies and ugly fields in open areas to frame themselves to protect themselves from both snooping, poor neighbors and prodigal monkeys
 yah getband samudaayon kii dilli kii moulik, bhayaavah avadharana he
 "I say different but you are wrong to call them lower class," Kejriwal told me
 hamaare bich pichhlaa samvaad saal bhar pehle hua tha
 Then we debated, firstly on Anna's movement and then - when i saw his giddy, deep populistism and he expressed my dislike for his personality and politics
 lekin ab vah zyada pukhta rajnatik hai, moti chamadi vaale, or jaisaa ki maine apane haal ke prakaashan anticepating india kii bhoomika main anumaan lagaaya tha—unhone mukhyadhara kii shanti ko paa liya he
 “there are two classes in Delhi
 ek vah jise hamaare 49 din ke shashan main sidhe phayda mila—sabsidiyon, keemton main giravat or chote bhrashtachar main giravat se
 You are wrongly called the lower class
 usne pichhali baar jaldbaaji main hamaare istipha dene ke liye hamen maaf bhi kar diya he
 "the second class, they say, is middle and upper class, still apprehensive
" ''koi bhi yah sweekaar karne ko taiyaar nahin tha ki hamen lokapal bill ke mudde par istipha dena chahie tha
 "so, their slogan is - five years, Kejriwal
" unhone ek sanghathan khadaa karne kii disha main shandaar kaam kiya he or aise pratibhashali log jutaaye hai jo bijepi ko bhi ranneeti main maat de dete hai
 His youth team playing electoral wrestling has transformed his weaknesses into strengths
 pehle unke mafalar kaa majaak udaaya jaataa tha, ab vah ek style-statement ban gaya he
 "my social media team landed with Mufflerman's hashtag and it kept trending for a month," he says
 unki lagaataar khaansee kaa bhi majaak bana
 So now he openly coughs on the mic as if he is putting his side
 unhen bhagoda kaha gaya isliye vah apane prachaar abhiyaan bhaashan kii shuruyaat main khud hi is baat ko maan lete hai or iske liye maafee maang lete hai
 But the basic thing is that he understands Delhi better than the rest
 wiphoi muft dene kii peshkash isi samayik kaabiliyat kaa parichay he
 Ironically, the lower class of Delhi is more inclusive and tolerant than its elite class
 garib ilaakon kii aabaadiyaan apni jagahon va maukon ko lekar zyada sahajata se ghulmil jaati hai
 You will find the jerk (hindu) meat shop right in front of the halal (muslim) meat shop
 nihaari parosane vaale barkat kii roti or pahari hindu dhaba agal-bagal mil jaaenge
 As people continue to increase illegal floors and expansions in the sidewalks and air, walking in most of the streets is like walking in concrete and steel forests
 aage badi hui khidakiyon, balakaniyon or airkandishanron (ji haa, ye koi garib ilaake nahin hai) ke bich se aasmaan kii ek jhalak bas dikh paati he
 They want everything - including electricity for their AC, but they don't want to pay for it
 ve buniyadi taur par pratishthan virdohi bhi hai
 The traditional trade union movement is over, so Kejriwal brings all these three things - freebies, power and defiance
 kejariwal ne apana arthgyan bhi behad kaayade se taiyaar kar rakhaa he
 He says, no one wants to live in a slum, but no one wants to be pushed even thirty miles away from the city
 isliye ve alag-alag modelon kaa adhyayan karke punarvaas kii yojana chalaayenge
 He says, "we will not convert Delhi into a slum but we will not throw those living in slums out of Delhi
 ”purab purab he or pashchim pashchimpurvi or pashchimi dilli ke bich virodhabhas utana hi tikshn he jitna ki un pratyaashiyon ke bich jinke saath main baari-baari se ja rahaa hum
 There is fire and passion in Kejriwal, image and peace in Kiran Bedi
 kejariwal pehle hi jam chuke hai or bedi ko is samay desh kii sabase taqatvar party ne maidan main utaara he
 Obviously, this is a big thorn collision
 kejariwal ke log aapako jo bhi abhas dene kii koshish kar rahe hon, sangh / bijepi kaa aadhaar or kaaryakarta bedi ke saath jame hai
 Even if they oppose Bedi as an outsider, it would not have been obvious
 pashchim dilli main sthit arya samaaj road jhandevalaan main sangh mukhyalay se mahaj aadha mile dur he jahaan main bedi ke prachaar trek par savaar hota hum
 You realize that you are in West Delhi when so many firecrackers burst when the candidates arrive that they look like a shootout between BSF and Pakistani Rangers in Jammu
 or yah sab bade khushnuma maahaul main hota he
 Bedi swaps flowers and garlands with her fans
 phir koi trek ke aage chadh jaataa he
 He has a thong in his hand which is filled with white pigeons
 bedi unamem se ek ko apane haath main pakadati hai or logon kii kartal dhwani ke bich aaazaad kar detii hai
 The symbol of the release of pigeons in the election campaign is beyond my comprehension
 lekin pashchimi dilli main aapke paas he to shaan se dikhaaiye or agar nahin he to bhi bhaad main jaae, phir bhi dikhaaiye
 If Suketu Mehta called Mumbai our maximum city, then we can call West Delhi as our maximum sub-city

 It is difficult to tell the meaning of this in any family magazine, but it can be understood by saying that my stuff alone can surprise all the competitors

 West Delhi has given Delhi its Punjabi complexion — paralyzed by its food, opulence, grime, cholesterol, cellulite, dolle, wisdom, and tears
 viraat kohli, shikhar dhawan, virendra sahvaag, gautam gambhir, eshanth sharma—in sabhi main koun-si baat ek jaisi he? ye sabhi pashchimi dilli se hai
 Like in East Delhi, there is an enterprise in every household and it has been flourishing for decades

 After demonetisation, 80 thousand such cases have been reported in which the Income Tax Department is investigating after the non-filing of income tax return
 kendriya pratyaksh kar board (CBDT) ne isaki jaankaree di he
 Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) chairman Sushil Chandra gave this information on Wednesday
 unhone pragati maidan main vyapaar meley main iskar vibhaag ke stall kaa udghaatan kiya
 On this occasion he informed that the Income Tax Department has identified 80 lakh people who have filed their returns during the last three years
 lekin is baar ab tak ritern daakhil nahin kiya he
 Chandra said that after Huinnotbandi in November 2016, it has helped to increase the tax base in the country
 unhone kaha ki notebandi se pratyaksh karon se desh kaa shuddh rajasav bhi badha he
 "last year, direct taxes contributed 52 per cent and indirect taxes contributed 48 per cent," Chandra informed
 '' unhone bataaya ki kai saal baad aisa hua he, jab pratyaksh karon kaa yogadan apratyaksh karon se adhik rahaa he
 What did the demonetisation help? Answering this question, Chandra said, 'I would say that the money came into the bank accounts
 isse hamaare liye ye pataa lagaana aasaan ho gaya ki kitne logon ne paise to jamaa kiye, lekin unka ritern daakhil nahin kiya
 Regarding the action taken after demonetisation, CBDTPM chief told that the Income Tax Department then sent emails and SMS to a large number of people
 kai logon ne iske baad apana ritern daakhil kiya
 Chandra said that after Kinotbandi, notices were sent to three lakh people who did not file returns
 ye sanvaidhanik notice the
 2 after notices 25 lakh logon ne ritern jamaa karaayaa
 Although 80 thousand people have not yet submitted the returns
 iske baad vibhaag inke peeche laga hua he
 The issue of airport construction in Uttar Pradesh's Meerut district is getting entangled in political strings
 rajya sarkaar hawaii adde ke liye jameen dene kii prakriya par abhi bhi chuppi saadhe hue he
 The special thing is that the government has agreed to give free land in four cities, but the screw of Meerut is stuck
 meerut main hawaii adde ko lekar kendriya mantri choudhary ajit singh pahal kar chuke hai
 For this, there has been a lot of discussion between the state and the central government
 ajit singh ke naagarik uddyan mantri banane ke baad logon ko hawaii adda banane kii ummid jaagi thi
 His party Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) has also consistently promoted it as his issue
 mana ja rahaa he ki is puure maamle main bas yahi fans he
 In fact, the ruling Samajwadi Party in the state does not want Ajit, being the aviation minister, to gain political advantage in the coming Lok Sabha elections and that is why the matter hangs
 raajnneetik vishleshak haalanki, yah bhi maanate hai ki aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav main sapa kii yah ranneeti kahin meerut or aasapaas ke jilon main us par baari na pad jaae
 Especially, when SP got better results in Meerut and adjoining districts in the last assembly election
 is baar pradesh sarkaar ke kaddavar mantri shahid manjuur meerut loksabhaa kshetra se sapa ke pratyaashee hai
 In such a situation, the SP should not do its own damage in order to not benefit the RLD
 iraq kii rajdhani baghdad ke dakshin purv hisse main shanivaar ko ek car bam hamale main kam se kam 21 log maare gaye jabaki kareeb 42 log ghayal hue hai
 According to local police officials present on the spot, the attack was carried out by targeting Shia pilgrims going to Qazamia, the holy shrine of Baghdad
 haalanki iraqi suraksha adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki yah hamalaa bich bazaar main kiya gaya he
 These two separate statements have not been resolved immediately
 adhikariyon ne pahchaan ujagar nahin hone kii shart par bataaya ki unhen media se baat karne ke liye adhikrut nahin kiya gaya he
 In the coming days, a large number of Shia devotees from all over Iraq are expected to visit this holy shrine in connection with the eighth-century death anniversary celebrations of Imam Musa al-qazim
 philhal kisi ne isahamale kii jimmedaarinhin lee he
 However, the Islamic State has been responsible for targeting and attacking people in Shia-dominated areas of Shia devotees and Baghdad

 PDP which is an ally of the government and AIADMK is just one party with which Narendra Modi has a good relationship
 lekin fark bhavishya kii raajnneeti ke gart main chipa he jahaan bijepi khud ko dekhnaa chaahati he or us bhoomika tak pahuchane main party ko ummid he to sirf AIADMK se
 Sasikala is the next big face of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, by placing his hand on the head of his special colleague Sasikala near Jayalalithaa's body, gives many hints
 ye baat saafe he ki aane vaale dinon main shashikala AIADMK main sabase ahm kirdaar nibhaane vaali hai
 It was not hidden from anyone that while Jayalalitha was battling with life and death in the hospital and the discussion was going on about who should hand over her legacy, the party and cadre had the same name on their tongue
 khud par chal rahe adalati mukademon ko dekhte hue centre sarkaar se philhal achche sambandh rakhaneshshiklaki bhi jarurat he or rajya se lekar rashtriya raajnneeti main AIADMK kaa saath bijepi kii apni jarurat he
 The central government played a full role from the hospital to the funeral, sensing the support of the people, who were with the Center at every turn
 centre kaa numaayinda banaakar kendriya mantri venkaiya naidu ko chennai bheja gaya to vahiin varisht kai kendriya mantri rajya main upajane vaale sanvaidhanik sankat ke bare main jayalalita ke sahyogiyon ko salaah dete rahe
 National mourning was announced and all the ministers started talking about the amicable relationship between Amma and Modi
 raashtrapati chunaav main sahyog kii ummidab bijepi ko naa sirf agle saal hone vaale raashtrapati chunaav ke liye AIADMK ke samarthan kii jarurat he balki congress or mamata banerjee samarthit vipaksh ke khilaaf bhi
 Therefore, in the coming time, the strategists of the party will be trying to somehow help the opposition reach the brink of AIADMK breakdown due to Amma's departure
 bijepi ko phayda is baat kaa he ki vichaaron ke maamle par do dhruvo main batin tamilnadu kii raajnneeti main dakshinpanthi vichaaro par wo shuruyaat se hi AIADMK ke saath khadi he
 Though it does not have a shining star like Amma or MGR in the state nor a cast combination like DMK, the challenge for the party is to fill this void
 modi se the madhur rishteye vahi bijepi he jiske netaa kabhi shankaracharya kii giraftaar se aahat hokar jayalalita ke khilaaf dharne par baithe the or ye ammaa kii vahi party he jisane atal bihari vaajapeyi kii sarkaar girane par sonia gandhi se najdiki sadhi thi
 But the game changed when Narendra Modi became Prime Minister, whose relationship with Amma has always been politically sweet
 satta main aate hi modi ne sahyogi naa hone ke baavjood AIADMK ke netaa ko loksabhaa main upasabhapati banwaaya to jaya ne virodh ke baavjood jiesti bill par sarkaar ko asamanjas main naa daalate hue walkout kar bill paas karvaa diya
 Right now the state's chief minister Panneerselvamka aims to get a grip on the party and Sasikala has to prove herself in the absence of Amma
 in donon ke bich kii pratispardhaa hi bijepi ko aane vaale dinon par rajanithik phayda pahunchaayegi
 It is obvious that he will have to try to create a sweetness with both of them in some way, only then he will be able to stand his political crop on the moisture of sympathy developed for Amma
 saal 2002 ke baad narendra modi raajnneeti kaa aisa cheharaa bane jisaki shakhsiyat vikaas ke model par taraashi gai to sampradayikta kii chaaya ne kabhi daaman nahin choda
 Actually, in the way of Modi becoming the PM, there was an attempt to make this a hindrance
 ab vah pradhanmantri hai, lekin kathith taur par charchaa he ki desh ke alpsankhyakon main modi ke aane se asuraksha hui he
 At the same time, Modi talks about taking everyone along
 aise main bada sawaal ki 100 din baad musalamaanon ke man ko kitne bhaae piem modi?panchayat ajtak ke 9wein seshan 'muslim ke man bhaae modi' main jamaat ulema-e-hind ke agxcutive member or netaa moulana mahmud madani, congress netaa raashid alvi, sipiem saansad mohammad saleem or bijepi netaa sheshadri chaari ne hissaa liya
 Question: As soon as Modi came to Delhi from Gujarat, Muslims started feeling insecure
 kya aisa vaaki main he yaa paracepshan he?madani:muslim samaaj main koi asuraksha nahin he
 Insecurity can happen due to any one incident in one area, but it is not so in the whole country
 sawaal: kaha jaataa he ki muslim kisi ek mudde par jhat se ek ho jate hai?raashid alvi:ye baat sahi he ki bahut saare raajnneetik dal muslimon ko vot bank ke taur par dekhte hai
 But it is wrong to say that they unite quickly on any one issue
 har rajya main ve alag-alag partiyon ke saath hai
 Yes, it is true that ever since this government came, it has been trying to frighten Muslims, but they are not afraid
 sawaal: daraane se kya laabh hoga?raashid alvi:vot bank kaa laabh hota he
 Modi offering a Gita in Japan is a very good thing
 lekin unhone yah bhi kaha ki mere desh main so cold secular logon ke maathe par bal pad jaaenge
 i want to ask if Modi is the Prime Minister of any party, one party or one community on foreign land
 madani:agar main apni baat karun to main kisi se nahin darataa
 No political party has made this country a secular but the people have created it and this country will always be secular
 sheshadri chaari:jahaan tak bhagavat gita kii baat he to wo modi ji ne tathakthith secular logon ke liye kaha he
 Rashid Alvi Ji, you don't need to worry too much
 haa, vot bank ke naam par kisi samudaay ko nahin daraaya janaa chahie
 Mohammad Salim: Communalism is in our thinking

 Seshadri Chari: i am neither an expert of Jihad nor love

 Question: Was there a mistake on Section 370? Seshadri Chari: We say that whether it is Section 370 or General Civil Code, there should be discussion
 lekin jaise hi dhara 370 kaa zikr aata he hangaamaa ho jaataa he
 It is a matter of Muslims that there is a vote bank
 ham kah rahe hai charchaa to karaao
 Rashid Alvi: You talk about the constitution, but you don't even have the blue print of the general civil code
 bijepi dhara 371 kii baat kyon nahin karti, jo arunachal or nagaland ko khaas darja detii he
 Why don't you ask the people of Kashmir what they want on Article 370
 sheshadri chaari:dhara 370 keval kashmir se hi nahin balki desh se bhi judaa mudda he
 It is also related to other states who want to do business there
 dhara 370 ke hatane se jitna phayda kashmiriyon ko hoga utana hi phayda tamilnadu ke vyapaariyon ko bhi hoga
 Because right now their trucks cannot go there and sell goods
 raashid alvi:sheshadri ji aap ye to maanate hai ki hamaari or aapaki is baat par koi asahmati nahin he ki kashmir bharat kaa atoot hissaa he
 Then if you take a decision on Kashmir then you will consult Kashmiris or not
 sheshadri chaari:maine ye nahin kaha ki kashmiriyon se mat pucho
 The whole country will decide on Article 370
 kashmiriyon se bhi pucho or tamilnadu main baithe sheshadri chaari se bhi pucho
 There is an atmosphere in the country today
 dhara 370 par baat honi chahie
 Question: Does Modi like Muslims? Madni: Modi ji is our Prime Minister
 abhi sirf 100 din hue hai
 If they keep the people below okay, then perhaps there is no need to ask this question

 Mahatma Gandhi once wished that he wanted to live for 125 years
 gandhi jis tarah kii nishkaam or yogitv kii paraakaashtha par pahunchi jindagi jite the, usamen ye mushkil jarur ho saktaa tha lekin asambhav nahin tha
 If that had happened, they would have been alive till 1994
 is vakt ham unako yaad kar rahe hote to unke naa hone ke 25 varshon kii antaheen pidaa ke rup main or yaad karte to is rup main ki kabhi haad maance kaa vah farista is dharti par chalaa tha, iskaa yakeen karnaa bhavi maanav sabhyataa ke liye mushkil hoga
 This is the year of the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and hence an attempt to capture his memories, to convey his personality to the common people has been done by senior journalist Arvind Mohan, through the book '150 ba-bapu' published from National Book Trust
 is kitaab main aap gandhi kii jindagi ke tamaam pahaluon se rubaru ho sakate hai
 He has his personal life, how he gets out of his childhood submissive, how to take tough decisions to improve the life of another, try him first on his own, how to be very ahead in serving his wife
 100 years before today, because wives in Indian society were nothing more than colonies for their husbands), participated in the freedom struggle of India
 A
 So why offload the clothes from his body and why charge fees for the show itself did not have a doctor they cost when charging a fee to touch your feet or sick but the doctor
 aise samay main jab desh bhaawanaaon kii asay jowar main ghira he, gandhi ke sansmaranon ko padhanaa ek nai drushti kholane laayak hoga
 It is not easy to read Gandhi in its entirety because i had once read in student life that the most literature written on any personality after Napoleon Bonaparte in the world is Mahatma Gandhi
 apane vidhyaarthee jivan se lekar ajtak maine jis vyaktitv ke bare main sabase zyada padhaa or guna, ve mahatma gandhi hi hai lekin aisa lagata he ki us gandhi ke bare main hamaari samaj shunya he
 Gandhi's personality is such that he stands behind that void and makes our spirits ten times
 us gandhi ko thode main prastut karne kaa prayaas apni kitaab main arvind mohan ne kiya he
 When the narrative falls on the facts and we deliberately leave the truth out of our eyes, then it becomes more necessary to remember Gandhi
 masalan aaj jab goraksha ko samaaj sudhaar kaa paimaana bana diya gaya he, tab gandhi hamaare saamne goseva kaa pratibimb banakar ubharate hai
 When a calf was in unbearable pain, Gandhi could decide to put it in the lap of death by injecting poison into it
 pataa nahin, aaj hote to hamaare mahaan ‘rashtravaadi’ unki kya durgati karte!gandhi vartmaan ke seene par khadey ateet kaa vah louh stambh hai jisapar khadaa hokar apana bhavishya nihaar sakate hai
 Gandhi breaks the misconception of this option when we believe that power is the only option to save society, nation and civilization
 santatv ke pahaluon se alag gandhi kaa ek pahalu nitant raajnneetijna kaa he
 When Gandhi meets the emperor of the British Empire as a representative of slave India, when he comes in a dhoti and asks why he comes in such clothes, he says that the cloth of my part has also been worn by the emperor
 vah gandhi hindustan main raaje-rajavaadon kii vilasita par prashnvachak chihn lagaataa he or aam aadmi ke hiton kaa hami banataa he
 He devotes his life to bridging the psychological, social and political differences between Gandhi, hindu-muslim, and his 78-year-old chest, as its price, suffers three bullets and this country is a fire of atonement for ages
 arvind mohan ne apni kitaab main bagaiyr apni taraf se kuch kahe gandhi ke jivan prasangon se hi in pahaluon ko ujagar karne kaa prayaas kiya he
 If Gandhi's white habit remains absolutely untainted in the Kajal chamber of politics, how Gandhi's social revolution and personal life played an important role behind it, this aspect will also be revealed in this book
 gandhi se bada hindu is brahmad main koun hua hoga? lekin hindu dharm kii kuritiyon ke khilaaf, jaat-paant, chuaachhut ke khilaaf unhone aawaaj uthaai to banaras ke pandon ne unki tasviir main aag lagaai
 a black flag was shown in Deoghar
 pune main bam phenkaa, karachi main kulhadi se waar kiya
 Gandhi was the biggest signature against Brahminism in this country
 aise hi un logon ne gandhi kii hatya nahin kar di thi, jo brahmanwad ke poshak the (hai) or aad hindutv kaa lete the (hai)
 Without making any specific comments on his behalf, Arvind Mohan has tried to bring Gandhi's personality to the people, but this book also disappoints
 kitaab kii bhashaa aisi he jaise kisi dasvin fail ne likhi ho jabaki lekhak eme paas ho
 In many places the syntax is very messy
 bhashaa ke pravaah main taratamya kii kami he
 The spelling flaw is found in the natural sense
 gandhi or kasturba kii jindagi ke 150 varshon ko dedh sau kahaniyon main sametanaa aasaan nahin he lekin uskaa ek krambaddh aacharan ho saktaa he, jise nahin nibhaayaa gaya
 It seems as if this book has been written in a hurry
 kam se kam gandhi par aisi jaldbaaji nahin honi chahie kyonki jis dhiraj or aatmasanyam se gandhi ne apni sari ladaai ladi, wo dastaan itani prerana dene ke liye kaaphi he ki unke bare main likhte samay ashuddhiyon or atakanon se bachaa jaae
 At the same time, many episodes were undeserved while many episodes were left unfinished
 jaise ki gandhi ke sachiv mahadev desai kii mrityu par gandhi kii pidaa ko
 In the condolence message sent by Gandhi to his wife on the death of Mahadev Bhai, it was written that there is no need to mourn you, because i have become more widowed than you
 in saare sawaalon or sandarbhon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue jaruri he ki jald hi is kitaab kaa aglaa sanskaran aae
 At the moment, you must read this book once because today this country needs Gandhi the most
 100 saal pehle se bhi zyada

 -input language punjab ke cabinet mantri navjot singh siddhu ke bataur mantri pad par rahete hue kapil sharma ke kamedi sho main shirkat karne ko lekar mache raajnneetik bavaal ko punjab sarkaar ko khatm karne kaa man bana rahi hai
 According to sources, Punjab Chief Captain Amarinder Singh had sought a legal opinion from Punjab's Advocate General Atul Nanda on this matter and is now preparing to give a green signal to Navjot Singh Sidhu in this matter
 punjab ke edwocket general atul nanda kii or se of record mili jaankaree ke mutabik shuruuaati tathyon ko dekhakar aisa nahin lagata ki navjot singh siddhu ke khilaaf offis of profit yaa Conflic of Interest kaa koi maamla banataa ho or unke TV main kaam karne ko lekar koi kanoonee pechidagi ho
 But according to law experts, Kavanjot Singh Sidhuka, while holding the ministerial position, taking all the facilities that a minister has, pleading to make money in this way, joining a private TV channel program according to ethics and a ministerial code of conduct not right
 siddhu kaa kamedi sho chhodane se inkaar, bole- ye laabh kaa pad nahin hapunjab-haryana hoicourt ke varisht vakil harbhajan singh bajva, jagmohan singh bhatti or ech
 C
 aroda ke mutabik navjot singh siddhu ke maamle main bhale hi punjab sarkaar ye kahe ki ye offis of profit yaa Conflict of Interest kaa maamla nahin banataa lekin bharat ke pradhanmantri narendra modi ne apane kendriya mantriyon ke liye jo model code of conduct lagu kar rakhaa he
 If that Government of Punjab also implements the Model Code of Conduct, then in this case it would be a violation of the code of conduct
 apane sho par kapil sharma kaa majaak udaana chaahate hai krishna abhishekakanoon ke jaankaron ke mutabik navjot singh siddhu ko moral ground par naitikta ke aadhaar par TV sho main kaam karne se bachanaa chahie kyonki jis tarah ke sho main wo kaam kar rahe hai usase aane vaale dinon main ye maamla badhata hi jayega
 Other ministers, officers and employees of the Punjab government and other state governments can also plead by examining Navjot Singh Sidhu that they too can do any other work after finishing their official work of 9 to 6
 isi vajah se navjot singh siddhu ke ek role model or ek rajaneta hote hue ek misaal kaayam karte hue kamedi sho main kaam karne ke apane faisle ko taal dena chahie
 CM Amarinder will take legal advice on the TV career of Sidhu, a minister, and social worker H

 Arora has written a letter to the Chief Secretary of Punjab on the case of Navjot Singh Sidhu
 ech
 C
 aroda ke mutabik kanoon ke mutabik sanvaidhanik padon par rahane vaale rajaneta code of conduct se bandhe hote hai
 In such a situation, the case of Navjot Singh Sidhu doing a comedy show on TV may not come in the office of profit, but according to the code of conduct, Navjot Singh Sidhu cannot take money in exchange for appearing in a program on TV
 aise main navjot singh siddhu ko TV sho karne se roka jaae
 H
 si
 Arora has made it clear that if Navjot Singh Sidhu continues to serve as a minister despite his appeal and continues to work in TV, then he will complain to the Governor of Punjab and also in the punjab-haryana High Court
 Will file a petition regarding to kya band ho jayega kapil sharma kaa shovahin bharat sarkaar ke adishnal solicytor general satyapal jain ke mutabik kanoon yaa samvidhan main aisa koi praavdhaan nahin he ki navjot singh siddhu ko mantri pad par rahete hue TV sho main jane se roka ja sake
 It has to be decided first whether Navjot Singh Sidhu achieved a special objective by taking advantage of this position by going to Kapil Sharma's comedy show as a minister and then through that work to the producers of the channel or Kapil Sharma show
 There is no attempt to do it
 satyapal jain ke mutabik ye maamla offis of profit yaa Conflict of Interest kaa to nahin banataa he lekin naitikta or ek mantri kii aachaar samhita kaa maamla ye jarur banataa he
 The way Navjot Singh Sidhu is adamant about his stubbornness to work in TV and wants to continue in the post of a minister, a wrong example in this coming future is being given to other politicians, officers and government officials
 is
 krishna abhishek ke sho main naa jaakar kapil ke sho main aaenge ye special guestcaptain amarinder singh ke navjot singh siddhu ke paryaton mantralay ko badalakar kisi duusare mantralay ko saunpane ke bayaan par bhi satyapal jain ne kaha ki isse is samasya kaa hal nahin hoga or jab tak bataur mantri navjot singh siddhu tamaam sarkari suvidhaayen le rahe hai to aise main unki naitikta or aachaar samhita par lagaataar sawaal uthta rahegaa ki kaise wo mantri pad par rahete hue is tarah se TV sho ke madhyam se paisa kamaane main lage hue hai
 The compulsion in front of Captain Amarinder Singh is that after 10 years, all the big leaders of Congress, especially Navjot Singh Sidhu, who came to power in Punjab, have to take him along
 isi vajah se captain amarinder singh kii ore se edwocket general se legal opinian ke madhyam se navjot singh siddhu ko TV sho main kaam karne ko lekar hari jhandi dene kii taiyaari he
 But as long as Navjot Singh Sidhu will continue to hold the post of minister and will also continue with TV shows, the debate over his ethics and conduct of a minister will continue
 aise main kanoon ke visheshgyon ne bhi navjot singh siddhu ko yahi raay di he ki wo is puure bavaal ko khatm karte hue apana dhyaan mantri pad kii ore lagaaein or apane mantralay kii jimmedaari sambhalate hue kisi bhi duusare kaam or khaas taur par TV sho ko karne se bachein
