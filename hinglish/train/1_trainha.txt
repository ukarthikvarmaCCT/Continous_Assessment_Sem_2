 Ivey also has a helpdesk where the visually impaired and their families can call and ask questions about their problems, get guidance and connect with the facilities and resources available to them

 jorge samaveshi shiksha par ek kitaab, 'handbook of inclusive ajukeshan for agucators, administators and plansrs' ke sahalekhak bhi hai
 He considers himself lucky in this matter, but says that although inclusive education is a strong concept, the way it is implemented in India proves to be negative rather than effective
 vah kehete hai, 'drushtibadhiton se samaaj kii ummiden behad kam hoti hai, lekin samaaj or swayan uske parivaar ko unhen sahanubhuti ke sthaan par ek sambhavit maanav sansaadhan ke rup main dekhnaa hoga
 His parents expected him to do better in school, playing his role at home, and a good job after completion of education

 Hopefully, slowly, but there will definitely be a change in the attitude of the people looking at the sight

 res-3 main khatarnaak or pichhali res filmon se behatar stant hone kii baat kahi gai thi
 But people's reaction says something else

 Anytime a fight starts

 Expensive vehicles have been flown for action scenes, a lot of money has been spent
 lekin ye stant seens impact nahin daal pate

 There were earlier reports about the climax of Race-3 that many climaxes have been shot

 Many viewers were so bored of Race-3 that they could not even sit in the theater till the climax
 vahiin jinhone dekha unhen clymex behad kamjor laga
 Apart from this, the climax is quite confusing, not knowing what the directors were looking for

 ye maine padhaa he
 Also read that those who are opposing the bill are speaking the language of Pakistan
 sanjay raut ne kaha ki ye pakistan kii sansad nahin he
 It belongs to India
 hamaare majboot pradhanmantri hamaare majboot grahamantri aapse bahut aashaa he
 We are the master of the school in which you study
 hamen sharnaarthiyon ko sharan de rahe hai to ghuspaithiyon ko nikaalnaa chahie
 We must accept them on the basis of humanity
 us par raajnneeti nahin honi chahie
 He said, "he has given support on all the issues and will continue to give
 kai jagahon par bill kaa virodh ho rahaa he
 Violence is taking place from Assam, Tripura, Mizoram
 '' raut ne aage kaha, ''deshbhakti kaa pramaan patr lene kii jarurat nahin
 There is no need to give evidence of how much courage we have
 yah bill dharmik nahin he, lekin maanavtaa ke aadhaar par is par charchaa hona chahie
 i believe that all the brothers including Sikhs, Muslims of Pakistan, Afghanistan, Bangladesh are being violated
 main maanata hum ki unako sweekaar karnaa chahie lekin usamen raajnneeti nahin honi chahie
 Sanjay Raut finally said that the Home Minister should first settle the Kashmiri Pandits back in Kashmir
 sanjay raut ko 5 minute kaa samay diya gaya tha is bill par bolne ke liye lekin wo samay samaapt ho jane ke baad bhi bol rahe the
 The Deputy Chairman of the Rajya Sabha asked him to sit down and then asked BSP leader Satish Chandra Mishra to speak
 haalanki sanjay raut ne yah spasht nahin kiya he ki wo is bill ke samarthan main hai yaa virodh main
 Earlier in Parliament, Derek o'brien of TMC said that you are not taking care of the people of the country and talking about respecting others? Bengal is not Gujarat
 derek o bryan ne kaha ki vaada karne main zyada vaada todane main yah sarkaar shandaar he
 The government says that there is some reason to worry about this bill but i say there is reason to worry
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar ne notebandi ke samay kaha ki aap mujhe 50 din de dijie agar halaat thik nahin hue to aap mujhe saarvajanik jagah par sajaa de dijiega
 But that did not happen
 derek o bryan ne kaha ki ye log jhooth bolte hai
 Those who say they do not, therefore there is cause for concern on this bill
 westeindies ke captain derren saimi ne kaha ki yadi unke ballebaaj shivnarayan chandrapal se prerana lekar krij par tikkar khelte hai to vah bharat ko pehle test cricket match main 350 ran kaa lakshya dene kii koshish karenge
 The West Indies have lost two wickets for 21 runs in the second innings after gaining a 95-run lead in the first innings but Sammy feels it will not be difficult to give India a strong target if his batsmen maintain their patience
 saimi ne duusare din kaa khel samaapt hone ke baad kaha, ‘dekhiye ham 450 ran kaa lakshya dene ke bare main to nahin soch sakate lekin ham jitna sambhav ho utane adhik ran banane kii koshish karenge
 We also played in Bangladesh under such conditions and our strategy was also there
 ’unhone kaha, ‘wicket dhimaa he or gend nichi rah rahi he
 In such a situation, the batsmen will have to set foot at the crease
 jis tarah se pehali pari main shiv (chandrapal) ne ballebaaji kii yadi ve usee tarah se tikkar khelte hai to ran banate rahenge
 We are looking to target close to 350
 ’bhartiya team ko 209 ran par sametane kaa shrey saimi ne apane gendbaajon ko diya
 He said, 'we have full confidence in our ability
 puraa shrey hamaare gendbaajon ko jaataa he
 They had a good start but we have patience
 hamane wicket tu wicket or sidhi gend karne kii ranneeti apanaayi jisase hamen safalataa bhi mili
 Sammy said that his bowlers have the ability to dismiss India on both innings
 unhone kaha, ‘hamen kabhi apane gendbaajon kii kshamta par andeh nahin tha
 We bowled out India on three of four occasions in the West Indies
 hamen sahi aria main gend karne kii apni kshamta par vishwaas he
 Be it Sachin or Ishant Sharma, you have to bowl in the right area to get the result
 ’unhone leg spinner devendra bishu ke bare main kaha, ‘vah hamaari gendbaaji vibhaag kaa ahm ang he
 He is not in his best form but the good thing is that he is taking wickets
 yadi vah lagaataar line va length se gendbaaji karegaa to zyada safal rahegaa
 The Caribbean captain also praised wicketkeeper Carlton Baugh for giving the team some important wickets
 unhone kaha, ‘ham carlton ke prayaas ko kam nahin aank sakate
 He did a great job in difficult situations
 lakshmana or sahvaag ko jis tarah se unhone out kiya us tarah ke pradarshan se puri team kaa manobal badhata he
 Revealing the strategy against Sachin Tendulkar, Sammy said, "when Sachin came to the crease, i handed the ball to Fidel Edwards
 jab duniya kaa sarvshereshth ballebaaj saamne ho to aap uske saamne apane sarvshereshth gendbaaj ko lagaaoge
 We had strategized them to bowl straight and find chances of lbw which proved to be effective
 ’saimi ne bhartiya spinner pragyan ojha kii bhi tarif kii
 He said, 'left-arm spinners are often successful against us
 ham pehali baar ojha kaa saamana kar rahe hai or uski footage dekh rahe hai
 He is bowling wicket to wicket but for the next matches we will make a strategy by watching the footage
 ’ Attacking Narendra Modi, Congress President Sonia Gandhi said that those who do not believe in secular values, cannot understand the spirit of patriotism and if they get power it will destroy the country
 modi ko nishane par lete hue sonia gandhi ne aaj kaha ki vah deshbhakti kaa nagaada baja rahe hai or janata ko gumraah kar rahe hai
 Addressing his first public meeting in Delhi after the announcement of the Lok Sabha elections, the Congress president also criticized Arvind Kejriwal for running away from the government after becoming the chief minister
 sonia ne upie sarkaar dwaara kiye gaye ‘aitihaasik’ kaaryo’ kaa zikr kiya or janata se ek baar or upie kii sarkaar banane kii apil kii
 He said that some people are playing the role of patriotism
 'aap bataaie ki jo log dharm nirpeksh mulyon main yakeen nahin karte, deshbhakti kii bhaavana ko kya samaj sakenge
 They want to mislead you and grab power only for themselves and their people
 ' Sonia did not take Modi's name, but her reference was towards Modi
 kuch din pehle hi modi ne raksha mantri eke antni ko pakistani agent bataaya tha
 Sonia said that patriotism is in the veins of Congress and it can be learned from the 'sacrifice' of Congress leaders
 unhone loksabhaa chunaavon ko do vichaardhaaraon kii ladaai bataaya or janata se kaha ki vah bhaajapa kii charampanthi or vibhaajankaree vichaardhaara ko parrast kare
 Targeting Kejriwal, Sonia said that some people thought that running the government was a children's game
 'aapane dekha ki kis tarah ve dilli (sarkaar) se bhaag gaye
 ' daliton or garibon ko lubhaane kii kavayad main sonia ne sir par mailaa dhone kii pratha ko samaapt karne or pheriwaalon ko kanoonee darja dene ko lekar bane kanoonon kaa ullekh kiya
 He said that the police and administration would no longer be able to harass the hawkers
 muslimon ke liye samprag sarkaar dwaara kiye gaye kaaryon kii charchaa karte hue unhone kaha ki sarkaar ne sachhar samiti kii adhikansh siforeeshon ko lagu kiya he
 He said that if voted back to power, the Congress will provide health security to the people and pension to the needy
 sonia ne kaha ki unke liye ganga jamuni parampara satta se adhik mahatvapurn he or bure iraade vaale log desh or samaaj ko tabaahi or andhere kii ore le jaaenge
 He told the public, 'I believe in your intelligence
 mujhe yakeen he ki aap koi galati nahin karenge or congress kaa samarthan karenge
 He said that bjp's ideology divides the society and fights one brother to the other while the Congress believes in keeping the society united and looks at everyone with one eye
 isse pehle sonia ne assam ke lakhimpur main ek chunavi jansabha ko sambodhit karte hue bijepi or uske pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar narendra modi par prahaar tej karte hue logon se is vipakshi party kii ‘nafrat kii raajnneeti’ se saavdhaan rahane or uske jhuthe vaade evam badi-badi baton ke jhaanse main nahin aane kaa aahvaan kiya
 He said, 'the opposition, especially the BJP, is roaming around the country and talking big things and what did it do when its government was at the Center?' He said that the BJP and its leaders are engaged in 'politics of hate'
 unhone logon se vipaksh ke jhuthe vaadon ke jhaanse main nahin aane balki apane vivek kaa istemaal kar congress ke samarthan main nirnay lene tathaa uske ummidavaaron ko vot dene kii apil kii
 He said that the Congress has strengthened the ganga-jamuna culture of the country
 congress adhyaksh ne kaha, 'ham jhuthe vaade nahin karte
 We deliver on the promises we make
 congress ‘har haath shakti, har haath tarakkee’ main vishwaas karti he
 ' sonia ne kaha, 'hamane 2009 ke ghoshnaptr main jo bhi vaade kiye the, saare puure kiye
 We will do the same in the case of the 2014 manifesto and we need your support for that
 ' upie adhyaksh ne kaha, '(vipaksh kii) kathani or kerani main kaaphi antar he
 The people of the Northeast know the real nationalism, hope you do not come in the guise of those who simply beat the drum of nationalism
 ' Targeting BJP, he said, 'congress has always shed its blood and sacrificed for the country
 duusari taraf, aisa dal he jisane bas desh ko baanta he
 He said that Congress workers in Assam and other places continued to make sacrifices for the country before independence and after independence, the Congress was engaged in nation building
 sonia ne aarope lagaaya, 'tab bijepi or anya dal kahaan the? aazaadee se pehle or uske baad vipaksh kaa kahin koi naamo nishaan hi nahin tha
 They are simply engaged in dividing the country

 In Lucknow, the capital of Uttar Pradesh, the ATS team arrested an international smuggler with a fake note of seven lakh rupees from the railway station
 aaropee ke paas se hajaar or paanch sau ke nakli note baraamad kiye gaye
 The case is of Charbagh railway station in Lucknow
 aties ko apane khufia sutron se khabar mili thi ki ek bada taskarnakali notonki khep lekar train pakadaney ke liye aayega
 Based on the information, the ATS team spread the net at Charbagh Railne station
 soochna ke mutabik team ne adhikari vishramghar ke paas se anrrashtriyataskargiroh ke sadsy nizamuddin ansaari ko giraftaar kar liya
 Fake notes worth seven lakh rupees were found in the bag from him
 baraamad hui rakam main ek-ek hajaar rupee ke paanch sau or paanch-paanch sau ke chaar sau note shaamil hai
 The ATS found out in the interrogation that Ansari is a resident of East Champaran district of Bihar
 vah varsh 2009 se nakli noton kii taskari kar rahaa he
 In questioning, he has revealed the names of many people involved in this business
 ab aties ke adhikari is giroh se jude anya taskaron kii dhar pakad karne kii yojana bana rahi he
 Currently, the accused has been remanded after presenting him in court
 bharat kemukhya nyaayadhishke khilaaf mahabhiyog ke prastaav par chaaron ore munh kii khaane ke baad aakhir congress ko kya mila? congress ko ye pataa tha ki mahabhiyog prastaav kisi keemat par paarit nahin ho saktaa
 Even if she brought the motion, it is clear that she wants to pressurize the Chief Justice
 pehle to congress ke mahabhiyog prastaav ko uparashtrapati ne asweekaar kar diya
 Against this, on May 7, two Congress mps reached the Supreme Court but there was no hearing in the bench where they reached
 iske baad masale par sunwaayee ke liye paanch jajon kii samvidhan peeth kaa gathan der shaam hua or isaki soochna website par daali gai or sunwaayee 8 may ko tay hui
 The most important thing was that the Chief Justice did not include the Chief Justice and the four judges who made allegations against the press conference Justice in the month of January
 variyata kram main chah se lekar das number tak ke jajon ne congress kii yachika par sunwaayee shuru karte hue congress ke vakeelon se mudde ke gundosh par bahes karne ko kaha lekin vakil is baat par ad gaye ki samvidhan peeth gathan kaa prashasnic aadesh unhen muhaiyaa karaayaa jaae
 They were not ordered to set up a constitution bench and were asked to either withdraw the application or the bench would dismiss it
 congress ke taraf se vakil ne yachika waapas le lee
 Even after the withdrawal of this petition, the Congress has the option of filing a fresh petition and seeking a copy of the administrative order
 jaj loya cese jaise kuch maamalon main manachaahi bench na milane ke chalate court se khinchataan pehle se chal rahi thi
 After the judges' press conference in January, the visit of a leader of a party to a judge's house and his picture is well known to what extent politics is involved in this matter
 congress ko sansad ke bheetar apane prastaav kaa hashr or adaalat main yachika ke na tikne kaa abhas tha isliye usne prashasnic aadesh kii copy ko mudda banaaya
 In fact, Congress is troubled by the decisions of the court which affect its vote bank and is apprehensive about the outcome of the lawsuits which have a bad effect on its politics
 vah chif justise par sattadhari party ke ishaare par kaam karne kaa aarope lagaati he or isi kram main sijeai par dabaav banane ke liye mahabhiyog prastaav laai
 So that the Chief Justice is notorious
 lekin congress ke naakaam hone ke saath hi court se ek sandesh to saaf chalaa gaya ki raajnneetik dabaav ke aage adaalat nahin jhuki
 The country needs a fair court at this time because the leaders are constantly falling
 congress to vipakshi dal thi agar kabhi satta main rahane vaale dal ne dabaav banane kaa aisa prayaas kiya to adaalat ke paas doguni badi chunauti khadi ho jaaegi
 The Congress has put a stain on the career of the Chief Justice that he is the first CJI against whom the process of impeachment started
 ye bhi ki inke khilaaf chaar jajon ne baghawat kii
 But all these attempts to blackmail the court also became known
 munh kii khaane ke baavjood mahabhiyog episod se raajnneetik rup se kamjor hoti congress ko apane vot bank main sangharsh karne vaali party or centre sarkaar ko chunauti dene vaali party kii chhavi ubhaarne main madad mili

 film kaa naam:kaagaj ke phulsdiarector:anil kumaar choudharystar cast:vinay pathak, mugdha godse ,ryma sen, saurabh shukla, amit bahal ,rajendra sethivadhi:109 minutesrtificate:u / aretimga:1 staramen lekhak hum, maine ek kahani likhi he, meri kahani chhapati nahin, or isi vajah se main sabaki najar main naakaara hum kyonki main sach main vishwaas rakhata hum
 Director Anil Kumar Chaudhary has tried his best to show these things through a film
 109 minute kii yah film kya aapkaa manoranjan karegi? aaie jaanate hai:kahanidelli ke model toun ilaake kii kahani he jahaan rahane vaale purushottam treepathi (vinay pathak) ek lekhak he jisaki kitaab 'ek thahari si jindagi' taiyaar he lekin koi use chhapane ko taiyaar nahin or unki patni nikki (mugdha godse) ko lagata he kii purushottam zyada koshish nahin karte, aage badhane kii ichhashakti nahin rakhte ityadi
 Purushottam works in an ad agency but for some reason has to leave the job and ultimately the only motive is to prove himself in the eyes of his wife and family
 phir dhire-dhire jindagi kii apadhapi main kabhi noodles or raajma kii ladaai to kabhi andhvishwaas ke liye kalah
 Then Nikki's brother (saurabh Shukla) and Kuku Seth (rajendra Sethi) work as Rubina (raima Sen )'s entry and the story goes on
 vinay pathak ek baar phir se usee andaaj main hai jo aapane unki pichhali filmon main pehle se hi dekh rakhaa he, is baar ek pati or lekhak ke rup main apane kirdaar ko nibhaa rahe hai to vahiin abhinaytasorabh shuklaka prayog puri tarah se kar paane main diarector asafal rahe hai
 Mugdha who is shown to be a part of a Punjabi family but her Hindi is also very difficult to speak while speaking, due to which her face and expressions of speech seem to be completely opposite, Raima Sen has given her character of Rubina to an extent Lively but overall the film seems unable to satisfy you through entertainment
 film main ek bhi gane kii jarurat nahin he kyonki jis pal bhi geet aate hai wo film kii lay ko kharaab kar dete hai achaanak se shaan kii aawaaj main vinay pathak aapako geet gaate hue najar aate hai or vahiin becoground main bhi seen ke dauraan mujeec aapako santusht nahin karata he
 Some of the dialogues in the film are comical such as' Ring ki nag ko nagina, one who loves and betrays him as kamina ', then some full of knowledge -' Writer is the one whose writing reaches the people 'and' Sometimes someone's home Should not become emotional dustbin '
 film 'viki donor' jaise saas bahu ke seen aapako is film main bhi najar aate hai

 He is accused of sexually abusing the children of an orphanage in Panaji, Goa
 bharat-britain ke bich baatcheet ke agenda main ab is 67 varshiya british naagarik kii file sabase upar he
 As a last-ditch attempt to bring Varley here and prosecute him, India has decided to put diplomatic pressure on Britain
 sibiai nideshak ranjit sinha ne haal hi main videsh sachiv sujatha singh se mulaakaat kii or unase british videsh sachiv ke saamne is maamle ko uthaane kii guzarish kii

 iskaa sanchaalan germany kaa naagarik fredy albert pits kiya karata tha, jise goa ke kuch log aadar se fadar fredy tak pukaara karte the
 But when the police raided the orphanage in 1991, he got evidence of the activities of the international child sex gang

 Some of the photographs involved extremely abusive acts with children
 sibiai ke mutabik worle ne bacchon kaa yon shoshan kiya or ek choti ladki kii nagn tasviren utaarin
 CBI alleges that he used to visit that orphanage mostly during Christmas, so that his crime is hidden in the atmosphere of celebration

 There he changed his name again to Deed Pol
 lekin sibiai ne jab goa ke avrajan adhikariyon se sampark kiya to worle yaa dead pole naam ke kisi videshi ke aane kaa koi sanket nahin tha
 Even the date stated by the British authorities was not known to anyone who had a British passport coming to Goa

 The CBI waited for 12 years
 aakhir janvari 2012 main sibiai dwaara jari kiye gaye red corner notice ke aadhaar par worle ko bainkak main giraftaar kar liya gaya
 Despite this, the CBI could not arrest him, who is a wanted criminal in 30 cases in India

 Britain should not be so difficult to persuade, as Varley has been convicted in the 1970s for sexual exploitation of children
 worle ke pehle aparaadh kii jaankaree tab mili thi, jab vah bisek saal kaa tha or west yorkshaire ke holifaques main bal sangrakshan adhikari ke taur par kaam karata tha

 You can enjoy within a radius

 However, Salman told Arya that things outside the house should not be brought inside
 minisha bahut samajhadaari ke saath pesh ain ai or usne arya kii is tippanee par koi bhi pratikriya karne se inkaar kar diya
 Today it was Arya's turn to sit on Danger posture
 jab salmaan ke arya se kaha ki aap surakshit hai or is asana se uth sakate hai, to arya ne uthne se manaa kar diya
 Salman got angry on this and said why are you showing me the attitude
 jis baat se aap guzar chuke ho, usase main kai baar guzar chukaa hum
 Eventually Arya and Pritam leave safely

 Ramdev said that political will and courage are needed for such a big decision because law and order and arrangements have to be arranged, it is not a matter of lallu-panju because he does not know how the country runs
 bharat main 99% muslim dharmantarityogaguru baba ramdev ne kaha ki bharat main 99 fisadi muslim dharmantarit hai or bhagwaan ram sirf hinduon ke nahin balki musalamaanon ke liye bhi shraddhey hai
 Ramdev said that the decision of the court is very important in terms of national unity
 ramdev ne kaha ki desh kaa sabase sundar bhagwaan ram kaa mandir ayodhya main hone chahie or yah ham sabhi kaa sapana he
 He said that not only the country but also the Ram temple of Ayodhya should be prepared as the most beautiful shrine in the world

 saath hi agar sansaadhan kam pad jaae to mere jaise ram bhakt hajaaron karodon rupee daan dene ke liye taiyaar hai

 hamaara dharm bhale hi agal ho lekin diene or purv ek hi hai
 He said that i authentically say that 99 percent of India's Muslims see their own form because all converts are Muslims
 mandir nirmaan main sahyog karen muslimyogaguru ne kaha ki ayodhya main ram mandir nirmaan ke liye musalamaanon ko bhi sahyog karnaa chahie kyonki vah bhi hamaare hi bhai hai
 He said that due to social and political reasons, the religion attack of Muslims has been different but that too belongs to us
 ramdev ne kaha ki hinduon ko bhi ayodhya main masjid ke nirmaan main madad kerani chahie taaki saamaajik sauhaard or bhaichaare kii misaal kaayam ho sake
 Ramdev said that people used to say earlier that a decision will be made on Ayodhya, but today the situation is completely opposite and all are living in peace

 The rally ended
 kafila jaise hi jangal se gujara
 Knuckles detonated the landmine and held it

 Date, 25 May 2013
 din, shanivaar
 Time, 3:00 pm, Place, Sukma, Chhattisgarh
 chhattisgarh main vidhansabha chunaavon ke pehle congress kii parivartan raily chal rahi thi
 
 
 All the big Congress leaders of the state were present in the rally
 aane vaale khatre se anjaan sabhi log khaanaa khaane ke baad kareeb 20 gadiyon ke kaafile main sukama se nikle
 Danger of attack of Naxalites
 darasal naksaliyon ne congress or duusari partiyon ko aisi reliyaan naa nikaalane kii dhamkee de rakhi thi
 But the Congress rallied in Sukma and after the rally was over, all the Congress leaders and their supporters left for Jagdalpur
 shaam kareeb 4:15 baje pradesh adhyaksh nandkumar patel kii aguai main 20 gadiyon kaa kaafila sabase zyada naksal prabhavit darabha ghati main jangal main pahunchataa he
 In the convoy, two escort vehicles were plying in front of Nandkumar Patel's car
 is baat se anjaan kii aage sadak par maut kaa puraa jaal bicha hua he
 In fact, the Naxalites had dropped a tree on the road and laid a land mine in that place and surrounded the whole area and are hiding in it and waiting for them
 tabhi kaafile main sabase aage chal rahi gaadiyaan jaise hi naksaliyon ke giraae ped tak pahunchi to kaafile kii raftaar tham gai
 As soon as the vehicles stopped, the Naxalites blew mines and after that there was a loud blast and both the vehicles flew in a blast
 abhi koi kuch samajhataa ki jangal main chhipe naksaliyon ne donon taraf se firing shuru kar di
 Actually, nobody had even thought in the dream that Naxalites can attack so big
 dhamaakon ke baad golibari ke chalate afratfari much gai
 Nobody was feeling anything
 isi bich congress pradesh adhyaksh nandkumar gaadi main savaar apane bete dinesh patel ke saath gaadi se baahar utar gaye
 On the other hand, Maoists were firing continuously on both sides, raising slogans of Maoists Zindabad
 haalanki kaafile main maujuud security guards ne bhi naksaliyon kii golibari kaa jawaab diya
 But his bullets soon ran out
 ab naksali kaafile kii taraf bade or har gaadi kii talaashi leni shuru kar di
 Seeing the situation worsening, Nandkumar Patel surrendered with his son Dinesh Patel
 unke saath sukama ke emele kwasi lakma bhi the
 Seeing them surrender, the Naxalites took the three and took them about 200 meters inside the forest
 naksaliyon ne sabase pehle netaaon ke saath maujuud security guards ko apana nishaanaa banaaya or unki hatya karne ke baad kareeb 100 naksaliyon ne ek-ek gaadi ko check karnaa shuru kiya
 Congress party state secretary Dr
 Shiv Narayan Dwivedi was also present in that convoy
 golivari ke dauraan wo apni gaadi se utar kar zamin par let gaye
 All three of his security guards present with him were killed
 tabhi unke peeche vaali gaadi main baithe mahendra karma gaadi se utar kar unki bagal main let gaye
 Along with these two, former Congress MLA Phoolo Devi was also lying
 darasal naksali ek khaas shaks kii talash main the or wo shaks the chhattisgarh ke purv grih mantri mahendra karma
 When he came to know, he surrendered
 unke milte hi naksali mahendra karma, dow shiv narayan dvivedi or baaki duusare logon ko pakad kar jangal ke andar le gaye
 Senior Congress leader Vidyacharan Shukla was also injured in the firing of Naxalites
 unako teen goliyaan lageen thi
 It had been more than an hour while the Naxalites were firing and every single moment was proving heavy for the people who were held hostage by the Naxalites
 jin logon ne sarender kiya tha unhen halki si ummid thi ki naksali shaayad unki jaan baksh den, lekin tabhi kuch aisa hua jisaki ummid kisi ko nahin thi
 Frightened by the attack, all the big leaders present in the convoy had surrendered to the Naxalites
 naksali sabhi ko pakad kar apane saath jangal main le aae the
 He asked all the people to lie on the ground on the stomach
 ab unhone sabhi se poochtacha kerani shuru kar di
 Meanwhile, the Naxalites took away the Congress state president Nandkumar Patel and his son Dinesh Patel
 unke saath sukama ke vidhayak kwasi lakma bhi the or phir naksaliyon ne bina kuch bole nandkumar patel or unke bete dinesh patel kii goli maar kar hatya kar di lekin unhone kwasi lakma ko chhod diya
 Even after so much slaughter, perhaps the Naxalites were not yet filled with heart
 ab unhone mahendra karma kaa naam lenaa shuru kiya
 When Mahendra Karma himself revealed his identity, he also took him inside with him
 
 As soon as he was identified, the Naxalites threatened him that he had survived his attack last time and this time there is no chance of his survival
 iske baad naksaliyon ne un par goliyon kii bauchhaar kar di
 Naxalites shot around 50 Karma
 itnaa hi nahin karma kaa berahami se qatl karne ke baad unki maut kaa jashn bhi manaaya
 According to Dr
 Shivnarayan, the Naxalites involved in the attack were between 20 and 25 years old
 naksali apni kamyaabi par bade khush dikhaai de rahe the
 Meanwhile, the Naxalites killed the leaders of the Congress by electing them to death
 inamen congress ke purv vidhayak udai mudaliyaar kii bhi maut ho chuki thi
 Dr
 Shivnarayan Dwivedi, who was eyewitness of this whole sentence, had a bullet in his arm and seeing the blood dripping from his hand, a Naxalite commander asked one of his comrades to inject him and give him water too
 unke mutabik unke kaafile par kareeb ek hazaar naksaliyon ne hamalaa kiya tha
 The Naxalites also gave the captives to the people that if such an attack happens again in the future, if they raise their hands, then the Naxalites will not kill them
 kismat kaa khel dekhie congress ke varisht netaa ajit jogi is hamale main bal-bal batch gaye
 Actually he too had to go to Jagdalpur with this convoy
 lekin tabiyat kharaab hone kii vajah se wo nahin gaye or unki jaan batch gaye
 The attack, which lasted for about an hour, killed more than two dozen people, while 35 Congress workers and 19 jawans are still missing
 hamale kii khabar milte hi ilaake main siarpief ke 6 hajaar se zyada javaanon ko bheja gaya he or jangalon main talaashi abhiyaan chal rahaa he or varisht congress netaa vidyacharan shukla gudgaanv ke medanta aspataal me jindagi or maut se lard rahe hai

 On this the CM neither took the news of his minister nor the family of the victim
 haa, jab pani sir se upar chalaa gaya or siem ko laga ki kirakiri zyada ho jaaegi to varun thakur ko phone kar unki ichha poochne lage
 However, only a few minutes after Khattar's call, the Supreme Court started hearing
 haryana sarkaar, centre, sibiesai or sibiai ko notice jari kar court ne yachika main uthaae gaye sawaalon kaa jawaab maang liya
 The attitude of the schools has come to the fore with the government and administration
 court ne bhi sunwaayee ke dauraan kaha ki ab ye sirf ek skool yaa bachche kaa maamla nahin balki desh ke skulon main padhane vaale sabhi bacchon kii suraksha kaa sawaal he, lihaaja is paranotice jaarikia jaataa he
 Now the government will have to answer the questions raised in this notice in three weeks

 rajasthan main 16 lakh logon ko naukari dene kaa vaada karke satta main ai vasundhara raaje sarkaar ke rojgaar vibhaag kii haalat dinondin khasta hoti chali ja rahi he
 Alam is that the condition of the employment department of the state has also become like the unemployed
 In the last four years, four lakh unemployed reached the employment department, but the department was able to provide jobs to only 765 people by spending Rs
 349 crore
 itnaa hi nahin, rojgaar vibhaag is saal july tak ek bhi vyakti ko naukari nahin dilaa paaya
 At the same time, the officers argue in the case that vacancy does not come, so where to get the job done
 is sambandh main rajasthan ke rojgaar mantri jaswant yadav kaa kahana he ki sarkaar ke paas nijee naukari nahin hai
 Employment will be provided in the private sector
 haalanki jab unase yah sawaal kiya gaya ki aakhir kaise rojgaar uplabdh honge, to vah bina jawaab die chalate bane
 The layer of dust that has accumulated in the chairs of the employment department, neither the staff nor any officers are present in the offices of the employment department of Rajasthan and other districts including Jaipur
 in daftaron main khaali padi kursiyon or tablon main dhul kii moti parat tak jam gai he
 Officers are seen moving around
 haalanki is vibhaag kaa kaam berozegaron ko rojgaar uplabdh karaane main madad karnaa he, lekin agar pichley chaar saal ke bijepi sarkaar ke aankadon par gaur karen, to chaar saal main kareeb chaar lakh berozegaar naukari ke liye rojgaar vibhaag ke daftaron main registration karvaa chuke hai
 But the department has managed to get only 765 people employed in the entire state
 soobe ke 16 jilon main ek bhi vyakti ko nahin dilava paaya rojgararajya ke 16 jile to aise hai, jahaan rojgaar vibhaag pichley chaar saal main ek bhi vyakti ko rojgaar nahin dilava paaya he
 Meanwhile, the number of unemployed applying for unemployment allowance has increased by about 20 percent
 rajya main sarkaar berozegaron ko 650 rupee berogari bhatta 30 saal se kam umr ke berozegaar ko do saal ke liye detii he
 349 crores was blown in the events This year i
e
 till July 2017, the employment department in the entire state has not been able to get a single job, while in the last four years, the department has spent Rs 349 crores on salary and allowances and events
 is babat jaipur ke rojgaar vibhaag ke upanideshak kaa kahana he ki sarkari naukari to ab aati nahin
 But so far four employment fairs have been organized for private jobs
 rojgaar dene ke liye kaha gaya tha, magar ab tak nahin diya
 We are reminding them again
 rojgaar vibhaag ke upanideshak ramesh sharma kehete hai ki sarkari naukari yahaan se ab milti nahin or privet naukari ke liye rojgaar dene waalon ko bulaate hai
 But no one listens
 telugana ke baad ab royal−telugana kaa mudda uth rahaa he
 a group of ministers has planned to reshuffle the old fixed border of Telangana and add two more districts to it
 kuranul or anantpur zilon ko telugana main shaamil karne kii baat kii ja rahi he
 This is being done with the intention of having equal parliamentary constituency in both the divided parts of Andhra Pradesh
 agar ye do zile telugana main shaamil ho jate hai, to telugana or simandhra main 21−21 loksabhaa siten or 147−147 vidhansabha siten ho jaaengi
 Congress can benefit politically by becoming royal-telangana
 tiares or telugana congress ke netaa iskaa virodh kar rahe hai

 kendriya telecom mantri manoj sinha ne kaha he ki desh main telecom mantralay kaa kaam sirf sarkaar ke liye revenue ekatra nahin he
 The Ministry of Telecom is also responsible for providing digital and other services in the country
 telecom mantri dwaara diya yah bayaan sanket detaa he ki jald aane vaali telecom niti main bade pherbadal kiye ja sakate hai
 Where the telecom sector is currently complaining that the central government levies a large amount in the name of levy and base price from the industry for allocation of spectrum
 ab telecom mantri ke is bayaan ke baad industry ke paksh ko rakhte hue kendra sarkaar apni telecom niti main pherbadal kar sakati he
 Along with this, the Union Minister said that the Ministry of Telecom has an important role in fully launching the Digital India project
 digital india taiyaar hone kaa phayda duusare sectoron ko bhi milegaa
 Read this: Is the Udaran on FDI the Modi government's last bet for the 2019 election battle? It is noteworthy that between 2010 and 2016, the central government had a total revenue of Rs 3,48,467 crore in 6 auction of spectrum
 telecom industry se spectrum ke liye bataur tex itani badi rakam vasule janaa ek pramukh kaaran he ki maujuuda samay main telecom companiyon par 7
 There is a debt burden of Rs 7 lakh crore
 iske saath telecom companiyon kaa daawa he ki telecom seva se ho rahi kamai ke ek rupee main unhen 30 paise bataur tex dena padataa he
 The Union Minister informed that the government is coming up with a new telecom policy of the country in March

 Along with this, the central government will include whatever provision it considers necessary to make Digital India successful
 bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) puri takat is baat par laga rahi he ki 2019 kaa chunaav camestry arthath chehre (modi) ke mudde par ladaa jaae
 The reason is clear that arithmetic (vote figures) does not appear to be in favor of BJP
 vaise bhi 2014 kaa jab chunaav hua tab bhi bhaajapa arthmatic ke lihaaj se vah chamatkaar nahin kar saki thi jisaki hawa modi ke chehre ne bana diya tha
 The BJP was able to get only 31 per cent of the votes in the last Lok Sabha election
 party kii asli chintaa bhi yahi he
 People who are active in the bjp's war room are going to the bottom of the data and issue
 un logon kaa akalan he ki yadi bhaajapa 2014 ke mukaable 5-6 fisadi vot ganvaati he to use sidhe 100 siton kaa nuksaan ho jayega
 BJP 25 in 1998 Lok Sabha Election
 59 fisadi vot hasil hue the or party ko 182 siten mili thi
 Whereas in 2014 BJP got 31 percent votes and the party won 282 seats
 party kii duusari chintaa yah he ki yadi arthmatic ko saadh bhi liya jaae to camestry (cheharaa) par hi sampurna ranneeti ko jhonk dena, chunaav nateezon ke baad sarkaar banane kii guarantee nahin he
 That is, it is unlikely that the government will be re-elected if it gets less than majority seats

 Before this, Jayant Patil, the new NCP Legislature Party leader who went to try to convince Ajit Pawar, also had to return empty-handed

 Those who try, do not lose
 'ensipi ne ajit pavaar (ajit Pawar) ko hataakar jayant patil ko vidhanmandal dal kaa netaa chun liya
 Ajit Pawar is silent but the BJP is opposing his appointment
 purv mantri or bijepi netaa ashish shellar ne press conference karke jayant patil kii niyukti ko avaidh bataaya
 If BJP sources are to be believed, then all his bosses are now on Ajit Pawar
 chunki ve ensipi vidhanmandal dal ke netaa hai or party ne kisi or ko chif vip nahin banaaya he to ajit pavaar kaa aadesh hi lagu hoga
 On the day of majority, if they issue a whip to vote in favor of BJP and even if they assume that all the mlas except them vote against the BJP, then the Assembly Speaker should issue an order to abolish all membership by making that whip a basis

 ab ek nai khoj se ye baat bhi saamne ai he ki hamaari kharaab lifestil bhi hamen dil kaa marij bana rahi he or videshiyon ke mukaable bharatiyon main iskaa khatra 5-6 guna zyada he
 With this discovery, only through a blood test can it be found that your artery has started getting blocked and you may be at risk of heart attack in the coming time
 gangaaraam aspataal main hui ek study main ye tamaam baaten saamne ai hai jise isiemr ne fund kiya he
 The new discovery has revealed two such things in the body that being in high amounts means tremendous obstruction in coronary artery and the full risk of heart attack
 sharir main do biomarker sistatin si or small dence kaa pataa chalaa he jisaki zyada maatra kaa sidhaa sambandh coronary artery main rukaawat se he
 Dr
 of Gangaram Hospital
 rajnish ke anusaar ye khoj yuvaaon main badhati coronary artery main rukaawat kii beemaari ko jald se jald pahchaanane main madad karegi
 These two biomarkers will show that if they are growing in the body, then one needs to be careful, avoid early treatment and treatment
 aankaden bataate hai ki videshiyon ke mukaable bharatiyon main coronary artery kii beemaari 5 se 6 guna zyada he or pehle jahaan 45 se 55 saal main coronary main rukaawat dekhi jaati thi ab ye umr ghatakar 25 se 35 saal rah gai he

 Doctors have raised a lot of hope from the identification of these biomarkers
 unke mutabik kam umr main yadi sharir main ye pahchaan liye jaaen to cholesterol kii maatra control kii ja sakati he
 Lifestyle can be improved, and the risk of heart attack can be reduced at an early age
 ahm baat ye he ki bade hi aasaan test se in markers kaa pataa kiya ja saktaa he
 These discoveries may in fact play an important role in reducing the number of growing heart patients

 ) thik ek maheenaa pehle 2 july ko centre sarkaar ne mahangaai rokane ke liye cabinet kii baithak kii or ek bahut bade faisle ke tahat yah elaan kiya ki aalu−pyaaj kii jamkhori rokane ke liye vah isaki adhiktam stock limit tay karegi
 That is, the government wants to define the definition of hoarding of potatoes and onion and this will happen when a wholesaler or retailer can keep the quantity of potatoes and onions with them, because so far there are fruit-vegetable perishable commodities so far No stock limit was applicable
 ek maheenaa ho gaya he or ab tak keval madhya pradesh ne yah daawa kiya he ki vah apane yahaan keval pyaaj par 3−4 maheenon ke liye stock limit lagayegaa, lekin aalu par stock limit lagane se vah bhi manaa kar rahaa he or daleel yah he ki pichley 4−5 saalon main madhya pradesh main aalu ke daam sthir rahe hai isliye aalu par aisi koi limit nahin lagegi
 In Delhi, the month before which the central government decided to impose a stock limit on potato-onion, this issue is still under discussion in Delhi
 desh kii sabase badi azadpur mandi, jo puure desh se judi hui he, uske vyapaaree bataa rahe hai ki desh main kahin bhi stock limit lagegi to sabase pehle unako pataa lagegaa isliye vyapaar sutara kah rahe hai ki mahinebhar main kaayade se to kahin stock limit lagu hui hi nahin he
 The Ministry of Food also has no such information, in which the states are informing about the imposition of stock limit
 aise main sawaal yah he ki ab ye puraa maamla kis taraf ja rahaa he or ab sarkaar ke mahangaai roko plan main aage kya ho saktaa he
 As far as my experience is concerned, according to it, the Central Government will say that it is the job of the State Government to impose stock limits and the State Governments will also count many reasons for not implementing the stock limit and the story will continue as it has been for years

 jabaki, jharkhand mukti morcha (jeemem)-congress or argedy aapas main haath milakar chunavi maidan main utarane kii taiyaari main he
 In such a situation, if the opposition camp joins the electoral arena, then the political equation of the BJP can get disturbed in the seats which the party won in the last election with a small number of votes
 bataa den ki jharkhand kii kul 81 vidhansabha siton main se 2014 main bijepi ne 37 siten or uske sahyogi ageesu ko 5 siten mili thi

 In this way Tala Marandi won by just 712 votes
 jabaki is seat par congress ke manju snehalata hembram ko 2,673 mat mili the

 While jmm's Haji Hussain Ansari got 67,441 votes
 is tarah se bijepi ne yah seat 6,984 maton se jeet darj kiya tha

 Ghatshilaghatshila assembly seat was won by Laxman Tudu of SEJP with 52,506 votes
 jeemem ke ramdaas sorain ko 46,103 vot mili the
 In this way, BJP won this seat with 6,403 votes
 jabaki, congress ke sindrella balamuchu ne 36,672 mat hasil kiya tha
 In this way, the jmm-congress will be united this time, then the bjp's equation may deteriorate

 At the same time, Sanjeev Sardar of JMM got 61,485 votes, thus he was defeated by 6,706 votes

 ) Me and my Sikh wife got married 41 years ago under the Special Marriage Act, 1954
 vaise to samaaroh shantipurvak sampann hua, lekin ek baar us samay mujhe apni hansi rokani padi, jab mujhe shapath leni padi ki 'apni purna jaankaree tathaa vishwaas ke anusaar' main kisi bhi or se vivaahit nahin hum
 If we had done this marriage before 1954, both of us would have had to renounce our religion before we could get married
 darasal, varsh 1954 se pehle samaan naagarik samhita sirf anishvarwadiyon tathaa naastikon ke liye uplabdh thi, jo apane purvajon ke dharm kaa parityag kar swayan ko siddh kar chuke hon
 All this changed in the year 1954
 bhartiya uttaradhikaar adhinium, 1925 (asampradayik visheshan 'bhartiya' par dhyaan den) ke saath shaamil kiye gaye vishesh vivaah adhinium ke jariye hamane 60 varsh pehle khud ko vaikalpik samaan naagarik samhita de di thi
 Yet Modiists, who have vowed to impose mandatory Uniform Civil Code on our minorities, are not pleased to explain why they have not adopted the Uniform Civil Code which has been present in our Constitution for 60 years till date
 nahin, ve aaj bhi hindu kanoon ke antargat vivaah karte hai, or apni nijee zindagiyon ko usee hindu personal lau ke tahat chalaate hai, jise teen anya kanoonon ke saath vaikalpik samaan naagarik samhita ke prabhavi hone ke baad varsh 1955 or 1956 main lagu kiya gaya tha
 And Modiists make fun of minorities who oppose the implementation of the Uniform Civil Code in place of their respective personal laws
 yah pakhand kisalie
 
 
 The Only to mock Muslims, to claim that Muslims are anti-reform, while the majority are progressive
 koi bhi personal lau un kanoonon se zyaada pragatisheel nahin he, jiske tahat maine vivaah kiya tha
 That was a decision i had to make reluctantly because the priests of the temple built by my father refused to perform the marriage ceremony because my bride was not a Brahmin
 uske baad haalanki unhone ek duusare pujari se vivaah sanskaar sampann karvaa lene kii peshkash kii, jo kuch paise lekar meraa kaam kar saktaa tha, lekin mujhe gussa aayaa, or maine vah peshkash saaf thukraa di, or apni bhavi patni kii sahmati se ek aise kanoon ke antargat vivaah karne kaa nirnay kiya, jo aadhunik or dharmanirpeksh tha
 That is why the majority community chose their personal law despite modern, secular laws being available
 
 
 ? sirf isliye ki hindu personal lau hinduon ke dil ke zyaada kareeb he
 In such a situation, why should their personal laws not be close to heart for other sects
 
 
 ? It is true that the Parliament has prepared Hindu Personal Law, while the rest of the Personal Law is not
 lekin aisa sirf isliye hua, kyonki mahatma gandhi ne yah sunishchit kiya tha ki swadhinata ke liye chalaaya gaya hamaara andolan na sirf videshi satta se mukti dilaae, balki ham un bhayanak kuprathaon se bhi chhutkaaraa paa saken, jo hinduon ke dharm tathaa samskruti se judi thim
 The making of the Code by Parliament was possible because it was the remaining work of the freedom struggle
 azaadi se bahut pehle, varsh 1941 main british bhartiya sarkaar ne bean rau kii adhyakshata main hindu lau cameti kaa gathan kiya tha, jisane apana kaam puraa karne main chah saal liye, or swatantraaa diwas kii purv sandhya par samvidhan sabha ko apni report saunpi
 Even after that, eight years were taken again, and finally the Hindu Marriage Act in 1956, the Hindu Succession Act in 1956, the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act in 1956, and the Hindu Minorities and Protection Act were passed in 1956 itself
 tab se lekar ab tak inamen kai sanshodhan kiye ja chuke hai, or nishchit rup se aage bhi hote rahenge, jiske chalate ise 'kaary pragati par he' mana ja saktaa he
 So, to expect that other sects would not take so much time to change their laws is malicious
 yah bhi dhyaan dena hoga ki rau cameti ke hindu code bill par sansad main hui bahason main sirf hindu saansadon ne hi bhaag liya, or muslim, isai tathaa parsi samudaayon kii bhagidaari bilkul nahin yaa bahut kam rahi, jiske kaaran gaiyr-hinduon ke dimag main aayaa, or lagbhag sahi aayaa, ki unke kanoon hindu hi banaate or sanshodhit karte hai, anya sampradaayon ke log nahin
 Then why tell Muslims or other non-hindus non-muslims how they have to improve their laws
 sudhaar aasaan nahin hote
 Hindu conservatives from President Dr
 Rajendra Prasad to the bottom tried to stop the reforms wholeheartedly, and left such loopholes in the code that there were more reports of bipartisan marriages and polygamy among Hindus than Muslims (1961 census And the 1974 report of the Committee on the Status of Women)
 iske alaava, varsh 1964 main hindu vivaah adhinium main kiye gaye ek sanshodhan ke parinamswaroop ab hindu talaak adhinium ke tahat ek patni ko 'uske vaivaahik nivas se aasaani se nikaala ja saktaa he, yadi pati yah kahe ki uske (pati ke) mutabik vivaah tut chukaa he

(yah main nahin kah rahaa hum, balki yah ambedkar uniwarsity, lakhanu ke vidhi sankaay ke dean professor ajay kumaar ne apni mahaan kalakriti 'uniform civil code : chalenjes and cancetrints, 2012' main kaha he) unhone hindu kanoonon par ek or visheshgy dow jediem deret ke hawaale se yah bhi kaha he ki iske baad lagu kiye gaye vivaah kanoon (sanshodhan) adhinium, 1976 kii vajah se yah 'ascharyajanak rup se mahilaon ke prati kahin zyaada asamvedansheel kanoon' ban gaya
 In his much-loved article in the December 16, 1995 issue of 'the Economic and Political Weekly', Flavio Agnes also introduced a bundle of unethical and malicious parts of the law
 baharhaal, jaisaa ki hyderabad kii nalsar uniwarsity kii kulapati farzaana mustafa ne sanshodhit hindu kanoon ko lekar sawaal kiya, "kya isse hindu mahilaon kaa utthan hua
 
 
 The How many Hindu women get a share in the property
 
 
 ? vastav main hindu mahilaon ko jaaydaad main jitna hissaa mila he, vah sanshodhit hindu kanoon ke anusaar unhen mil sakane vaali jaaydaad kaa ek bahut chota hissaa he
 
 
 Changing the law does not necessarily lead to social changes
 
 
 " or vah ant main likhti hai, "kanoonon main nirdeshaatmak badlaav laane se aavashyak saamaajik badlaav nahin aate hai
 
 
 "(the Hindu, 2 July 1994) isse ham yah behad mahatvapurn nishkarsh nikaal sakate hai, ki yadi kanoon ke saath-saath dharaatal par saamaajik sudhaar bhi chahie to kanoon main sudhaar sampradaay ke bheetar se hi hona chahie
 The same thing has been consistently said by the Indian Women's Muslim Movement (BMMA)
 bimeme kii sah-sansthaapak noorjahan safia nawaz ne 29 june, 2014 ko 'da hindu' kii patrika main kaha he ki saat saal kii avadhi main 10 rajyon main basii hazaron mahilaon, jinamein adhiktar garib thim, se salaah-mashvire ke baad unhone ek nayaa 'muslim vivaah evam talaak adhinium' taiyaar kiya he
 He says that the people of the sect should be allowed to discuss it first
 jaisaa ki pakistan samet kai muslim deshon ne dikhaaya he ki muslim personal lau main sudhaar karnaa bhi utana hi saadhy he, jitna hindu personal lau main sudhaar karnaa, lekin jaisaa hinduon se jude maamle main hota he, aisa tabhi sambhav he, jab sudhaar karne kaa dabaav sampradaay ke bheetar se hi daalaa jaae
 There will be opposition from the pressures from outside, especially when a sect is a minority, whenever reforms are attempted
 isi vajah se begum safia nawaz saaf-saaf kahati hai, "ham samaan naagarik samhita kaa virodh karte hai
 
 
 "they want the personal law of their denomination to continue, but they are confident that they can improve it from within
 nishchit rup se koi bhi deshbhakt bhartiya is pahal kaa swaagat hi karegaa
 It is argued by quoting the independent views expressed by the Supreme Court from time to time that the Uniform Civil Code will strengthen national integrity, but on the contrary, bringing a law without hastily preparing a consensus will only increase communal tension, The way the country is shattered by blasphemous comments made about the beliefs and beliefs and traditions of another sect
 
 yadi ham besabr hokar, sudhaaron kii prakruti ko lekar muslim samudaay main mataiky banane se pehle hamaari us sansad main kanoon banane ke jariye muslim personal lau main sanshodhan karte hai, jahaan muslimon kaa pratinidhitiv behad kam he, ham apane samvidhan main varnit us vyavastha ko khatre main daal denge, jo jatil saamaajik-kanoonee muddon se nipatane ke liye paristhitiyon ke prati samvedansheel he
 Our constitution is uniquely Indian, says Kumar, who understands the differences at many levels, and recognizes the differences between individual groups, so he boasts of various personal laws
 saath hi kumaar yah bhi kehete hai, "bharat sarkaar ne soch-samajhakar, haalanki chupake se, nazar bachaakar, saavdhaanee se, or dhire-dhire vibhinn bhartiya personal lau ke bich saamanjasy bithaaya, or personal lau ke unke apane-apane darje ko chunauti die bina sabko lagbhag ek hi jaisaa bana diya
 
 
 "he cites the Child Marriage Restraint Act, 2006 as an example, and describes it as a sensible way forward
 so, modi sarkaar ko samaan naagarik samhita ko thande baste main daalkar desh ko samaan vittiya samhita dene kii disha main shuruyaat kerani chahie
 Why should the tax exemption be given only to Hindu undivided families and not to undivided families of any other denomination
 
 
 ? so, hamen ummid he ki vittamantri arun jetali agle saptaah ke apane bajet bhaashan main is 'gugali' kaa jawaab zarur denge

 uddhav ne kaha ki bijepi bhi to aisa hi chaahati thi ki mukhyamantri usee kii party kaa ho
 At the Shiv Sena rally, Uddhav Thackeray hit back at the BJP and said, "yes, i want the Chief Minister to belong to the Shiv Sena, if the public wants it
" isamen galat kya he? kya bijepi apana siem nahin chaahati thi?'guuruuvaar ko bijepi ke saath gathbandhan tuutane ke baad shanivaar raat apni pehali raily ko sambodhit karte hue uddhav ne kaha ki ve mukhyamantri pad ke liye lalayit nahin hai
 He said, 'but if you are going to challenge me, i will show you that i will contest elections in your stronghold and become the Chief Minister
 'uddhav ne kaha ki bijepi lagaataar un siton kii bhi maang kar rahi thi, jo kai saal se shivasena kii he
 He did not directly speak against Narendra Modi, nor attacked the BJP
 unhone sawaal kiya, 'loksabhaa chunaav main maharashtra ne majbootee ke saath modi ko vot diya, par badale main shivasena ko kya mila?

 The assembly elections are due on October 15, a few days after the Sena's 25-year-old alliance with the BJP broke
 uddhav thakare ne apane mukhya chunavi mudde ke taur par marathi gaurav ke mudde ko uthaaya
 He claimed that the BJP had already decided to break the alliance
 uddhav ne kaha ki shivasena kaa pramukh hone ke naate unhone aakhir tak gathbandhan ko bachaane kaa prayaas kiya
 He said, 'I apologize to Maharashtra
 uddhav thakare ne gathbandhan ko nahin todaa

 In the Lok Sabha elections 2019, the Congress was told about its dilemma on a major strike surgical strike behind the massive defeat
 chunaav nateezon ke baad mana gaya ki congress sargical strike par saaf stand nahin le pai or logon main iskaa galat sandesh gaya
 Once again, the Congress Government's decision to abruptly remove Article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir is visible in the Congress repertoire
 congress ne bhale hi sansad main modi sarkaar ke is kadam kaa virodh kiya, lekin party ke bheetar ise lekar asamanjas kii sthiti bani hui he balki duusari party ke duusari qatari ke kai netaaon kaa alag rukh dekhne ko mila
 Even though the Congress has strongly opposed the removal of Article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir and the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganization Bill, former Congress MP Deepender Singh Hooda and Mumbai Congress President Milind Deora have supported the Narendra Modi government's decision
 jarnadan dvivedi ne bhi 370 par modi sarkaar ke faisle kaa samarthan kiya
 The stance of these leaders shows that there is confusion in the Congress on such issues, and it has no concrete strategy to surround the Modi government
 rajyasabha main congress ke netaa vipaksh gulam nabi aaazaad ne dhara 370 ko asarhin karne kaa taarkik tareeke se virodh kiya lekin unhen congress ke duusare netaaon kaa saath nahin mila
 Many leaders in the Congress Working Committee believe that whatever stand the party's senior leaders are taking in Parliament, it seems that the ground is far from reality
 ham jameen par siyasat karte hai
 In this way, the party is going to suffer a political loss due to the protest
 duusari ore rahul gandhi, priyanka or sonia gandhi kii taraf se is par koi bayaan nahin aana bhi congress ke asamanjas rup main dekha ja rahaa he
 The big leaders of the Congress are seen on the line against the provision to make 370 inactive, but the party's youth brigade leaders and activists are taking a different line from the party's stand
 isi ko mudda banaate hue rajyasabha main congress ke chif vip bhubaneshwar kalita ne rajyasabha se istipha de diya

 Pakistan's microbiologist Mohammad Khalil Chishti was acquitted of murder by the Supreme Court in a 20-year-old criminal case and allowed him to go home without restriction
 supreme court adaalat ne haalanki, jaanboojhkar nuksaan pahunchane ke maamle main bhartiya dand samhita kii dhara 324 ke tahat unki doshasiddhi main hastkshep se inkaar kar diya or utani hi sajaa sunai, jitani ki vah jail main pehle hi kaat chuke hai
 a bench of Justices p Sadasivam and Justice Ranjan Gogoi noted that Chishti remained in jail for about a year during his stay in India and that the purpose of justice would be served by sentencing him at par with the period spent in jail
 nyaayalay ne adhikariyon ko nirdesh diya ki ve chishti ko unke passport sahit sabhi dastavej waapas kar den
 It said that Chishti is free to return to Pakistan without any restrictions
 peeth ne chishti kii umr or yogyata par bhi vichaar kiya or adhikariyon ko nirdesh diya ki ve chishti kii baadha rahit swadesh vaapasi ke liye harsambhav kadam uthaaen
 The court also referred to its order of 10 May and said that since no further action is needed against Chishti, the bail amount of Rs five lakh should be returned to him or the person nominated by him
 sheersh adaalat ne 10 may ko chishti se do hafte ke bheetar ucchtam nyaayalay registry ke samaksh apana passport or paanch lakh rupee kii nakad jamaanat raashi jamaa karne ko kaha tha
 Two other accused in the case were also convicted only under Section 324 and ordered to be released immediately
 nyaayalay ne kaha ki maamle main koi vishwasaneey sakshya saamne nahin aayaa
 Prosecutors brought two sets of documents related to the crime and the evidence, which were conflicting
 isse purv, 4 may ko supreme court ne swadesh jane ke chishti ke aagrah par sunwaayee ke liye sahmati jataai thi or centre se is par jawaab maanga tha
 The apex court granted bail to Chishti on 9 April
 unhen 20 saal puraane hatya ke maamle main doshi tehraaya gaya tha or vah rajasthan kii ajmer jail main umrakaid kii sajaa kaat rahe the
 The court granted bail to Chishti on humanitarian grounds, but told him not to leave Ajmer until further orders
 centre ne haalanki, yah kahkar chishti ke asthaayee rup se pakistan jane par aapatti jataai thi ki ho saktaa he ki vah waapas nahin lauten, lekin nyaayalay ne unhen pakistan jane kii anumati de di thi
 Chishti came to Ajmer in 1992 to see his mother
 is dauraan vah ek jhagade main ulajh gaye, jisamen unke ek padosi kii goli markar hatya kar di gai, jabaki unka bhatija ghayal ho gaya
 Born in an affluent family to oversee the Dargah of Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti in Ajmer, Chishti opted to stay in Pakistan after the partition of the country in 1947, as he was studying there at the time
 tippaniyan After an 18-year trial, Chishti was sentenced to life imprisonment by the Sessions court of Ajmer on January 31 last year after pleading guilty in the murder case
 unhen purv main mukademe ke dauraan bhi nichali adaalat se jamaanat mil gai thi, lekin nirdesh diya gaya tha ki vah ajmer nahin choden
 He was arrested again after being convicted, so that he could serve the sentence

 karachi medical college ke jane-maane professor chishti edinburgh uniwarsity se piechdi hai
 The Supreme Court court, however, refused to interfere in his conviction under Section 324 of the Indian Penal Code in a case of intentional harm and sentenced to the same punishment as he had already been incarcerated
 nyaayamurti pi sadashivam or nyaayamurti ranjan gogoi kii peeth ne ullekh kiya ki chishti bharat main pravaas ke dauraan lagbhag ek saal jail main rahe or nyaay kaa uddeshy unhen jail main bitaai gai avadhi ke baraabar hi sajaa sunaakar puraa ho jayega
 The court directed the officials to return all the documents including their passports to Chishti
 isane kaha ki chishti bina kisi pratibandh ke pakistan lautne ko swatantra hai
 The bench also considered Chishti's age and qualifications and directed the officials to take all possible steps to return home without Chishti's hurdle
 court ne 10 may ke apane aadesh kaa bhi ullekh kiya or kaha ki chunki chishti ke khilaaf aage kisi kaarywahi kii jarurat nahin he, isliye paanch lakh rupee kii jamaanat raashi unhen yaa unke dwaara namankit kiye gaye vyakti ko waapas kar di jaani chahie
 On May 10, the apex court had asked Chishti to submit his passport and a cash bail of Rs five lakh before the Supreme Court registry within two weeks
 maamle ke do anya aropiyon ko bhi keval dhara 324 ke tahat hi doshi tehraaya gaya or unhen tatkaal reeha karne ke aadesh die gaye
 The court said that no credible evidence emerged in the case
 abhiyojan paksh aparaadh or sabooton se jude do set dastavej lekar aae, jo aapas main virodhabhasi the
 Earlier, on May 4, the Supreme Court had agreed to hear Chishti's request to go abroad and sought a response from the Center

 2014 main centre main aane ke baad se bijepi kii aguai vaali endie sarkaar ne kai rajyon main chunaav jitkar sarkaar banaai
 The BJP managed to form a government there despite not being the largest party in Goa and Manipur
 vahiin jammu kashmir main virdohi party ke saath haath milakar jammu kashmir main pehali baar sarkaar banane main kaamyaab rahi
 However, the bjp-led NDA suffered a crushing defeat in Delhi, Bihar and Punjab
 agar ham in sabhi chunaavon par najar daalenge tobiharka chunaav abhi gujarat hue vartmaan chunaav se miltaa-julata prathit hoga
 Let us know what are the things that lead the Gujarat election closer to the 2015 Bihar election
 1
 Both the issue of Bihar and Gujarat assembly elections were contested from the point of development
 bihar main modi ne apane 18 maheene ke kaarykaal ko aage rakhkar vot maanga
 At the same time, Modi also put the road map of the NDA government in front of the people
 vahiin gujarat main bhi piem modi or amit shah ne bhigujrat chunaavaki shuruyaat vikaas dar or vikaas se jude duusare aankadon ko pesh kar vot maanga
 2
 partiyon kaa neeche girnahalanki turant hi bihar or gujarat main raajnneetik bahasabaaji kaa ruukh vikaas se hatakar duusari taraf mud gaya
 DN started talking about the extent of falling down in Bihar
 yah silsilaa modi ke nitish kumaar ke political diene par die gay bayaan se shuru hua tha
 After this, supporters of Nitish started sending hair samples from the people of Bihar to the PMO
 gujarat main bhi vikaas ke muddon ko chhodkar congress ne piem modi par personal varbal atake shuru kar die
 He was called a tea seller and a vile
 vahiin congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi se bhi unke dharm ko lekar baat poochi gai
 After this, the Congress called him a Janeudhari Hindu
 congress ne iske liye pikchar bhi jari kiye
 The Congress protested against PM Modi's statement on former PM Manmohan Singh regarding the meeting held at Mani Shankar's house
 3
 The issue of outsiders One thing that was most common in Bihar and Gujarat was the issue of outsiders and local leaders
 bihar main nitish kumaar or argedy lalu prasad yadav ne yah mudda uthaaya tha or modi or shah par bahari bolkar atake kiye the
 At the same time, in Gujarat, Modi called himself the son of this soil and targeted Rahul Gandhi on this issue
 4
 Talking about caste politics, Gujarat is like Bihar
 14 pratishat tak jati aadhaarit vot ke palati hone se donon rajyon ke chunaav par asar padataa he
 While Yadav plays a pivotal role in Bihar, Patel plays this role in Gujarat
 donon hi jati apane apane rajyon main 14 pratishat aabaadi tak maujuud hai
 The formation of a caste-based group and its role in victory also played a very important role in the elections of both the states
 jahaan mahadalit, muslim or yadavon gathbandhan ne jediu or argedy kii jeet pakki kii
 At the same time, in Gujarat, the Congress took forward caste-based politics and combined the Patels and Kshatriyas to form paksh (paksha)
 gujarat congress ke bharatsingh saulanki ke pita or purv siem madhavsingh solanki ne 1985 main khaam (kham) kii sanrachana kii thi
 Kham means Kshatriya, Harijan means Dalit, Adivasi and Muslim
 is formula ne rajya main patidaaron kii bhoomika gaunya kar di
 This benefited the Congress for some time
 solanki kii leadership main party ne 1985 main 182 seat main se 149 par kabja kiya
 However, this move of Solanki led the Patidars to drift away from the Congress forever and with the help of the Patidars, the BJP won the 1995 election and Keshubhai Patel became the first CM of the BJP
 5
 cm's face In both states, the Ruling Party had already put its Chief Minister's face in front
 jahaan siem nitish kumaar mahagathbandhan ke chehre the to vahiin gujarat main bijepi ne bijay roopaani kaa naam siem phase ke liye rakhaa he
 However, BJP has also been taking the name of Deputy CM Nitin Patel to woo Patel and Patidars
 vahiin vipakshi partiyaan donon rajyon main mukhyamantri kaa cheharaa chunaav se pehle dene main naakaam rahe hai
 BJP and Congress did not announce their cms in Bihar and Gujarat respectively
 6
 Jeetwah can share another similar thing with such a commonality, that is to win again the party in power
 jahaan jediu ne bihar main satta barkaraar rakhi thi
 Exit polls are also indicating for Gujarat that BJP can retain power here
 18 disambar ko nateezon se yah baat saamne aa jaaegi ki kya donon rajyon ke chunaav main ek or saamaan baat judati he yaa nahin

 anti rape bilamangalvaar ko sansad main pesh kar diya gaya he
 The government has made several important changes in this bill before it was introduced
 kendriya cabinet ne kiye ahm badlaavakendriya cabinet ne faisla kiya he ki sahmati se sex kii umr seemaa 18 saal hi rahegi
 Chasing a girl would be a non-bailable offense, but no one would be arrested for just staring
 mote taur par partiyon main aam sahmatigauratlab he ki isse pehle anti rape bill par sahmati banane ke liye sarkaar ne sabhi dalon kii baithak bulaai
 In this meeting, there was a general opinion on the fat of the anti-rape bill, but many parties objected to the issue of reducing the age of sex with consent
 bijepi or bispi samet kai partiyon ne sarkaar se kaha tha ki agar ladakiyon ke liye shaadi karne kii nunatam umr seemaa 18 saal he, to sex ke liye sahmati dene kii umr 16 saal na kii jaae
 The government accepted this demand
 haryana main lagaataar ho rahi rape kii ghatnaon or doklam main ek baar phir chini sainikon kii ghuspaith par congress ne modi sarkaar par hamalaa bolaa he
 Congress leader Randeep Surjewala on Thursday morning put 7 questions on Modi government by holding a press conference
 unhone kaha ki jo satellite image saamne ai hai kya is baat kii jaankaree sarkaar ke paas he
 Will PM Modi accept that a new threat has arisen on Doklam
 congress ke modi sarkaar se 7 bade sawaal1
 Does the Modi Government and the Ministry of Defense know that China has captured Doklam? (according to the satellite image) 2
 china ne doklam main jo maujuuda sthiti paidaa kii he kya wo 28 agast, 2017 kii videsh mantralay ke bharat-china samjhaute ke mutabik he ?3
 How will the trijunction issue in Doklam be in future? 4
 media report ke mutabik china ne arunachal pradesh main 1
 Road is constructed within 3 km
 kya ye sahi he?5
 Will Narendra Modi accept that the new threat has arisen on the Doklam issue? 6
 videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ne kaha tha ki masale ko baatcheet se hal kiya jayega
 New developments in Doklam not violated? 7
 apane daawey ke mutabik modi sarkaar ne ghuspaith rokane ke liye abtak kya kiya he?in sawaalon ke alaava bhi surajevaala ne bijepi par jamkar hamalaa bolaa
 Taking a dig at AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi, he said that Owaisi is part of bjp's b team, he carries forward the disruptive agenda of BJP
 isliye unke bayanon ko deshhit main nahin dikhaaya jaae
 Surjewala also targeted CM Yogi Adityanath
 unhone likhaa ki adityanath vikaas ke naam par grahan, mukhyamantri kii naak ke neeche oxigen kaa pement naa hone se bachche mar jate hai
 The houses of Dalits should be set on fire and the CM remains silent
 daliton ko nahalaakar or itr lagavakar wo milte hai
 His rule has become misrule, his words do not matter
 haryana gangrape par bhi savalunhone kaha ki aaj bhi haryana ke fatehabad main gang rape kii ghatana saamne ai, mukhyamantri sirf lip sarvice kar rahe hai
 His government wants to sit in Delhi and run Haryana, the Chief Minister is not comfortable with BJP President and Center leaders making trips to Delhi
 sirf kuch adhikariyon ke tabadale se rape nahin rukne vaale hai
 Surjewala alleged that Haryana is at number one in the government figures in gang rape
 akele khatter sarkaar hi nahin centre bhi zimmedaar he kyonki apradhi haryana- dilli border kaa istemaal karte hai
 PM awake and ask his government to take strong action
 sallu bhai apane saath ke kalakaaron ke saath apni tulana karte rahane kii vajah se aksar surkhiyon main rahete hai
 But this time, he also sat tight on Indian cricketer Virat Kohli, because Virat's moody nature matches him
 iske chalate unhone viraat ko 'metrosexual' qaraar de diya
 Salman Khan recently arrived in Dubai for the launch of a jewelery store
 vahaan press conference ke dauraan cricket world cap ke maichon kaa zikr shuru ho gaya
 But as soon as Sallu Bhai was compared to Virat Kohli for his good looks and moody behavior, Sallu Bhai gave a statement that i do not think i am like Virat Kohli
 ve kafemetrosexualhai or main nahin hum
 He described Anushka Sharma's boyfriend Virat as a boy who is very concerned about his looks and loves shopping
 phir badi chaturaai se unhone topic change kar diya or apni personal life ke lakshya ke bare main baat karne lage
 Marriage is not so important for him as his desire for children
 philhalasalmaan india ke most eligible bachaler hanore jab bhi unase shaadi ko lekar koi sawaal kiya jaataa he, wo use majaak main taal dete hai
 Sallu Bhai is currently shooting for his next film 'prem Ratan Dhan Payo' with Sonam Kapoor in Gujarat

 70 Total money spent (crores) a rebellion inside the BJP in Karnataka may lead to a major uproar on Monday
 somvaarase shuru ho rahaa he rajya vidhansabha kaa satr
 The rebels are angry, the opposition has also got the issue now
 aise main sarkaar par dabaav banane ke liye vidhansabha main hangaamaa to ho hi saktaa he
 The day of Kamal's power in Karnataka has finally come
 bijepi ke shashan par unki hi party ke purv mukhyamantri yediurppa kii vakradrushti padi he
 And now in the statistics of democracy, the questions stood on Shettar's power mathematics
 or is ganit ke guna-bhaag kaa puraa kaam hone he vidhansabha main
 In the bjp's internal tussle, 14 mlas supporting Yeddyurappa have so far resigned
 spikar ne inamen se 13 kaa istipha manjuur kar liya he
 However, the Governor of Karnataka says that he has no formal knowledge of any political crisis
 aaj unke agenda par sirf karnataka vidhansabha ke sanyukt satr ko sambodhit karnaa bhar he
 By the way, if we look at the statistics game, then in the changed circumstances, there is no big danger on the chair of Jagdish Shettar
 225 sadasyon kii karnataka vidhansabha main bijepi ke paas pehle 119 vidhayak the
 Much more than the majority figure of 113
 ab jab 14 vidhayakon ne istipha de diya he to sadan main bahumat kaa aankada bhi kam ho gaya he
 The BJP has the support of its mlas as well as 1 Independent
 matlab kaante kii takkar main bhi aankada bijepi sarkaar ke hi saath he
 Probably because of this growth of statistics, Karnataka Chief Minister Jagdish Shettar has repeatedly claimed that his chair is safe
 bhale hi shettar ko apni kursi surakshit lage
 But the political drama of Karnataka is not going to stop
 bijepi ke baagi bhi bhare baithe hai, vipaksh main congress or jedies bhi taiyaar he
 This means that there is a possibility of uproar in the assembly
 bijepi ke liye sabase badi chintaa isi saal hone vaale vidhansabha chunaavon main apni satta ko bachaae rakhane kii bhi he

 These are not ordinary lines but they are called tripunds
 jaaniye kya he tripundamathe par chandan yaa bhasma se bani teen rekhaaen tripund kehalaati hai
 Tripund is made by Chandan or Bhasma with the help of three fingers
 tripund kii teen rekhaon main 27 devataaon kaa vaas hota he
 Each line has 9 gods
 tripund dhaaran karne waalon par shiv kii vishesh krupa hoti he
 Must visit Shri Siddhivinayak Temple in Mumbai, can be placed in 32 parts of the body
 Do not keep in mind that the Tripunda is applied only on the forehead
 tripund sharir ke kul 32 angon par lagaaya jaataa he kyonki alag- alag ang par lagaae jane vaale tripund kaa prabhaav or mahatv bhi alag he
 These organs include forehead, frontal, both ears, both eyes, both elbows, both wrists, heart, both lateral parts, navel, both knees, both calves and both legs
 kis ang main kis devtaa kaa vaasasharir ke har hisse main devataaon kaa vaas mana gaya he
 Shiva in the forehead, Moon in hair, Rudra in both ears and Ganesha in the mouth of Brahma, Vishnu and Lakshmi in both arms, Shambhu in the heart, Prajapati in the navel, Naag and Nagakanya in both the urus, Sage girls in both knees, sea in both feet
 And all the pilgrimage places in the vast hermitage form

 Ashes should be used the same ashes, which are obtained from the havan or yagna performed for the holy work

 If you do not get a job, then these remedies will also help
 Science also believes that the beneficial tripund is applied with sandalwood or ash
 chandan or bhasma maathe ko sheetaltaa pradaan karata he
 Doing more mental labor causes pain in the thinker center
 aise main tripund gyaan-tantuon ko sheetaltaa pradaan karata he
