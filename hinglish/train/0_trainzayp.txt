 The Chennai team, which dominated the last three seasons, is currently grappling with a spot-fixing scandal in which some of its players, as well as top officials, have been put under the scanner
 coach stephen fleming ne haalanki yah sweekaar kiya ki maidan se baahar ke muddon kii andekhi nahin kii ja sakati or yah team ke liye dhyaan bhang karne jaisaa hi he
 Referring to the betting controversy, Fleming said, "there's a lot going on, i won't lie
" toornament se pehle dhyaan bhang karne ke liye kaaphi kuch gata
 i think we were all unsure what would happen in it
 lekin spot phixing vivaad se jujhane vaali chennai kii team ko ipel main sabase zyada nirantar tiimon main se ek kaha ja saktaa he, jisaki aguwai bhartiya captain mahendra singh dhoni kar rahe hai
 This year, Chennai will take on the field without some of their dependent stars, including Australian player Michael Hussey and South Africa's Albie Morkel, whom the team lost in the players' auction
 lekin newjiland ke visphotak ballebaaj brendan maikulam kii upasthiti se chennai kii team majboot dikhti he
 West Indies leg-spinner Samuel Badri could prove to be an important player in Sehwag's hopeful bowling as he would have gained confidence as the third wicket-taker in the recent World Cup Twenty20

 When Headley was arrested in 2009, the Vigilant Intelligence Department (IB) stalled the Ministry of Tourism's proposal to give benefits of Tourist Visa on Arrival (TVOA) scheme to tourists from other countries
 par iviefarti system ke saath hi khufia vibhaag kii sabhi aapattiyon ko darkinar kar diya gaya
 This system has been developed by the National Informatics Center
 is nae system kii madad se vija or imigration se judi anaapattiyaan jari karne vaale sabhi daftaron ke bich talmail bithaaya ja sakegaa
 It also includes offices of the Ministry of Home Affairs, Ministry of External Affairs, IB, Foreigners Registration Office and 150 Missions abroad
 is system main vija aavedak kii sari jaankaree darj hoti he or isi ke aadhaar par yah us paryatak ko bharat se baahar jane tak trek karata rahata he
 While getting electronic visa will boost tourism, IVFRT also has other advantages

 With this, smugglers will be able to keep an eye and know the methods of smuggling gold and drugs
 haalanki iviefarti main aavedak kii biomitric jaankaree jutaney jaise kuch pahalu abhi shuru nahin ho sake hai lekin adhikariyon kii maane to jab inaki shuruyaat hogi tab is system ko dagaa dena aasaan nahin hoga

 baharhaal jo bhi ho, priyanka gandhi ko chunavi raajnneeti se alag rakhkar party ko koi phayda nahin hoga
 He would definitely have benefited from his activeness

 dharna or sachaai main kitna antar he yah 7 disambar ko us samay saaf jaahir ho gaya jab patna hycourt ne rajyapal devanand conwar ke chancelar ke apane adhikaar ke tahat niyukt kiye gaye chah vaais chancelar or chaar pro-vaais chancelar kii niyukti radd kar di
 Chief Justice Rekha M
 doshit or justise e
 The Bench of Amanullah canceled these appointments because Governor Konwar had not completed the mandatory process of seeking advice from the state government before filling these posts
 court ne aara ke vir kuker singh vishvavidhyalay ke ek shikshak ram tavakya singh kii janhit yachika par yah faisla sunaaya
 The judicial order that the governor received is going to immediately tarnish his image, but the defeat is just hanny and seems to be limited to the case of Governor Konwar as it has strengthened the position of the governor more than the state government
 court ne apane aadesh main kaha he, ''apane chune hue logon ko vaais-chancelar or pro vaais-chancelar pad par niyukt karne se pehle chancelar ko rajya sarkaar kii raay leni chahie
 The Chancellor may approve or reject the State Government's opinion
 ''yadi aadesh ko padhaa jaae to aisa lagata he ki kul milakar asar yah hua he ki governor ko short turm ke nuksaan ke badale long turm ke liye phayda hi hua he
 It is not surprising that, even after the High Court dismissed his appointments, the Governor did not show any willingness to challenge the decision in the Supreme Court as it reaffirmed his dominance in the matter of appointments
 is aadesh se yah baat bhi sabit ho gai he ki 'sarvocch athurity' hone ke naate chancelar kaa faisla antim hona chahie
 After all, what could the Governor have achieved better than the Konwar court's decision, which was initially believed by everyone against him
 yah aadesh rajya sarkaar ko bhi is baat ke liye majaboor kar saktaa he ki vah bihar rajya vishvavidhyalay act or patna vishvavidhyalay act 1976 kii apane tareeke se vyakhya karnaa chhod de
 Earlier in January 2011, the State Human Resource Department had unilaterally sent a list of 12 names to the Chancellor to appoint a vice-chancellor from this suggested list
 rajyapal ne jaahir taur se rajya sarkaar kii naamon kii is suchi ko kachare ke dibbe main daal diya or 1 agast, 2011 ko apni pasand ke chah visi or chaar pro-visi kii niyukti kar di
 It is said that the Governor had strongly objected to the recommendation of the State Government in the matter of appointment of Vice Chancellor
 guwahati hycourt or supreme court main ek dashak se zyada samay tak lau kii practice ke anubhav ke saath shreshth kanoonee dimag rakhane vaale governor conwar ne lagata he ki aadesh kii baarikiyon kaa vishleshan kar liya he
 For this reason, perhaps he has allowed six Vice Chancellors to continue working till further orders
 court ne chah visi or chaar pro-visi ke padon ko bharne ke liye 30 din ke bheetar nai niyuktiyon ke liye nirdesh bhi jari kar die hai
 Those vcs who have been asked to continue in their position till 'next order' include Shambhunath Singh of Patna University, b

 Although Director General of the Border Security Force
 ke
 Sharma says that in the last two years only 200 Rohingya refugees have come to India, out of which only 12 were stopped this year
 sanyukt raashtra ne kade shabdon main kaha ki hamale ke baad sena kii javaabi karrwai ''saaf-saaf behisaab'' he or chetaya he ki rohingyaon ke saath myanmar kaa bartaav ''jaateey safaye kaa adarsh udhaaharan'' lagata he
 There is worldwide outrage over the exodus of Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar as nearly half a million people fled, mostly migrating to Bangladesh during the last five years
 haalanki myanmar ko bharat ke rup main ek dost mil gaya he
 During the visit to Myanmar in the first week of September, Prime Minister Narendra Modi told Suu Kyi, "we understand your concerns about militant violence in Rakhine province, especially violence against security forces and innocent people being killed due to this
 
 "bharat ne is aashaa main myanmar sena ke saath achche rishte bana rakhe hai ki vah purvottar main sakriy aatankwaadiyon ke khilaaf karrwai main madad karegi
 Many of these terrorists have established hideouts in the forests of Myanmar
 yah mahaj sanyog nahin he ki pichley ek saal main bhartiya sena ne myanmar kii seemaa main ghuskar purvottar main sakriy vidrohiyon ke khilaaf do baar oparation kiye
 It is clear from the letter sent by the Union Home Ministry to all states on 8 August that the Government of India had already decided its stand on the Rohingya case before the violence on 25 August
 grih mantralay ne us patr main kaha ki rohingya pravasi bharat kii suraksha ke liye bada khatra or desh ke simit sansadhano par boj hai
 At the same time, the administration and intelligence agencies were told that "this action of the illegal Myanmar security forces is in response to the attacks of the Muslim extremist organization Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA)
" earese ne aktubar 2016 ko kai suraksha chaukiyon par hamalaa kiya tha, jisamen kai pulisavaale maare gaye
 Then on 25 August this year, 12 security personnel were killed in his planned attack
 donon hi maukon par myanmar ke suraksha balon ne earese ko jad se mitaane ke liye bade paimaane par 'safai abhiyaan' chalaaya jiske kaaran kareeb 5,00,000 rohingya bangladesh bhaagane par majaboor ho gaye
 Begin the process of identifying the migrants and sending them back early
 " sarkaar ke mutabik, jammu, hyderabad, haryana, uttar pradesh, dilli-ensiaar or rajasthan main 40,000 rohingya rah rahe hai
 Most of them came here in 1982 after the Myanmar law to deprive them of citizenship
 sanyukt raashtra sharnaarthi ucchayog (yuanechasiaar) ke haalia anumaanon ke mutabik bharat main 2,00,000 sharnaarthi rah rahe hai or sharnaarthi aabaadi ke lihaaj se bharat 25waan sabase bada desh he
 There are many types of refugees here - Tibetans who came in 1959; Bangladeshi came in 1971; Dodge came in 1963; Tamils from Sri Lanka in 1983, 1989 and again in 1995; And Afghan refugees who arrived during the 1980s
 afghanistan, myanmar, somalia, congou, eritrea, iran, iraq, sudan or syria samet duniyabar se sharnaarthi bharat aae hai
 In 2012, UN secretary-general Antonio Guterus praised India's stance on refugees as an example for the world
 aisa pehali baar he ki centre sarkaar ne kisi sharnaarthi samooh ko nirvasit karne ke apane iraade jaahir kiye hai
 Home Minister Rajnath Singh described them as 'illegal immigrants'
 haalanki yah spasht nahin he ki sarkaar myanmar ko kaise un rohingya musalamaanon ko waapas lene ke liye raji karegi jinhen vah apana naagarik hi nahin maanata
 Roshni Shankar, executive director of Aara Trust, Center for Refugee Law and Forced Migration Studies, says, "those people may be a threat to our people in the future, are we just going to send the entire community back when we have to Well know that they will have to be victimized at the time of their return? "she says," We have never adopted such a policy before and it is not clear that against the Rohingyas Why is this being done? "in any situation involving refugees, India's response has been decided not by any constitutional policy but for political reasons as India is among the few countries in the world that have neither a national refugee protection framework
" Nor any immigration policy
 hamane yuan rifuji kanvension-1951 yaa uske 1967 ke protocol par dastakhat bhi nahin kiye hai
 Neither have we ratified the 1954 UN Convention on Statelessness or the 1961 UN Convention on Reduction of Statelessness
 isliye bharat baadhya nahin he ki sharnaarthiyon ko ukt sandhiyon main tay adhikaar de
 He decides to grant long-term visas to refugees in an ad hoc manner
 shankar kahati hai, ''aisi tadarth vyavastha ke kaaran bharat main ek spasht or susangat sharnaarthi vyavastha nahin ban pai or is vajah se vibhinn sarkaron ko apane rajnatik vichaaron ke mutabik nitiyaan apnaane kaa mauka mil gaya
 "most human rights activists allege that the bjp's stand against Rohingya Muslims is not because of security concerns, but because of anti-muslim ideology
 mumbai sthit centre for study of socity and secularism ke nideshak irfan ejeeniyar kehete hai, ''agar tamil sharnaarthi bharat main koi suraksha khatra paidaa nahin karte jabaki littey ne is samudaay se badi sankchaya main ladaake bhartee kiye, to bhala rohingya suraksha ke liye khatra kaise ho gaye? sirf isliye ki ve muslim hai, un par bharosa nahin kar sakate?"myanmar ko chhodkar sabhi padosi deshon ke log bharat main sharan ke liye sidhe sarkaar se maang karte hai or unhen videshi kshetreey panjiyan adhikari (epararo) jaruri dastavej jari karte hai jabaki myanmar samet sabhi gaiyr-padosi desh yuanechasiaar ke tahat aate hai
 The Commission, after evaluating each person's asylum application, inquires the applicant and issues the ID card as a refugee only after obtaining biometric data for registration
 is puri prakriya main chah maheene se ek saal lag jaataa he
 The government currently allows all UNHCR ID refugees, including the Rohingya, to apply for 'long-term visas' and each case is decided differently
 shankar kahati hai, ''yuanechasiaar ko sirf nai dilli se hi sanchaalan kii ijaajat he or durbhagyavash har sharnaarthi (rohingya samet) aupchaarik rup se sharan lene main sakasham nahin ho paata kyonki jab tak unke aavedan kaa moolyankan ho rahaa hota he, unke paas dilli aane kaa koi rasta nahin hota
 "that is why out of 40,000 Rohingya Muslims living in the country, only 16,500 are registered with UNHCR
 sharnaarthiyon bandobast ko zyada tarateebavaar banane ke liye sarkaar ne 1955 ke naagarikta kanoon main sanshodhan kaa prastaav rakhaa
 In July last year, the Central Government introduced the Citizenship Amendment Bill in Parliament
 isamen kaha gaya ki afghanistan, bangladesh yaa pakistan main dharmik utpeeda ke shikaar hue hindu, sikh, buddha, jain, parsi yaa isai majahab ke gaiyr-kanoonee pravaasiyon ko aane diya jayega or unhen na to kaid main daalaa jayega or na hi waapas bheja jayega
 However, Muslim refugees not included in this bill cannot relieve themselves of their human responsibility towards Rohingya

 He says, "in keeping with the growing economic and political status of India in international circles, it should accept Rohingya Muslims in certain numbers
" "sharnaarthiyon ke masale par centre kaa paraspar virdohi rukh us vakt bhi saamne aayaa, jab 14 sitambar ko isi centre sarkaar ne rohingyaon kii baadh se nipatane main sahaayta ke liye bangladesh ko maanviya sahaayta bheji
 Sankar says, "we are ready to provide financial assistance to Bangladesh but are concerned about the economic viability of doing so within our own borders
" "haalanki maanavadhikaar agenciyon or kaaryakartaaon ne tamaam rohingya musalamaanon ko sandigdh aatanki tehraane kii koshish ke liye sarkaar kii aalochana kii he, par is baat ke bhi kaaphi saboot hai ki duniya bhar ke jehadi guton ne is sankat kaa phayda uthaaya he
 Even refugees lodged at the United Nations Refugee High Commission (UNSCR) can be a threat, this was revealed in October 2016 when the Ansar police checkpoint, created to help inside the Nayapada refugee camp in Bangladesh, was attacked
 yah hamalaa nurul avsaar urf ruhullah naam ke ek shaks ne kiya tha jiskaa naam shivi main bataur sharnaarthi darj tha
 This is the reason why Veena Sikri, India's former High Commissioner to Bangladesh, supports the government's decision to repatriate the Rohingya and says that there is every possibility of Rohingyas being radicalized by the ARSA in India
 earese ne 14 sitambar ko jari ek bayaan main kaha ki uskaa al kaayda, iageies, lashkare taiyaba yaa kisi bhi duusare dehshatgard dhade se koi rishta nahin he
 Security analysts and counterterrorism experts are not ready to believe it, as a 2016 report by the International Crisis Group (ICG) states that the leader of the ARSA, Ataullah Abu Ammar Junjuni alias Hafiz Tohar, was born in Karachi and a madrasa in Saudi Arabia Went in yahaan tak ki uskaa sarparast abdus kadoos burmi, jo rohingya mul kaa hi ek or pakistani he, lashkar ke sargana hafiz said ke saath baithkon main bhi shaamil hua tha
 According to the ICG, the ARSA is headed by a committee of Rohingya migrants in Saudi Arabia and appears to be financially strong and fairly organized
 dilli police ke vishesh cell ne 17 sitambar ko al kaayda ke liye kaam karne vaale ek shaks samiun rahamaan ko giraftaar kiya
 This 28-year-old British citizen wanted to establish a terrorist module in eastern India by recruiting Rohingya Muslims
 yah pehla mauka nahin he jab al kaayda ke saath rohingya musalamaanon kaa judaav saamne aayaa he
 After 9 / 11, American troops received several videos, including those in Al Qaeda camps in Afghanistan, or were not extended to other neighboring countries like Nepal, Myanmar and Sri Lanka
 yah hindustan main rohingya sharnaarthiyon ko lekar sarkaar ke virdohi rukh kaa pehla ishaara tha
 After a massive public outcry and protest in Assam, which refused to bear the burden of 'illegal Hindu infiltrators' from Bangladesh, a Joint Parliamentary Committee is now examining the bill
 vidheyak ke samarthan main bhaajapa ke netaa or assam ke vitt mantri hemanth biswa sarama ne yahaan tak daawa kiya ki rajya main 55 lakh 'avaidh muslim ghuspaithiyon' kaa muqabla karne ke liye asamiya hinduon ko 1,50,000 'avaidh bengali hinduon' kii darkaar he
 While these are not official figures, this peculiar argument by the BJP leader makes the common complaint against Rohingya refugees meaningless that they are a burden on our economic resources
 supreme court ke vakil upamanyu hajarika kehete hai, ''agar 40,000 rohingya hamaare upar aarthik boj hai, to kalpana kiijie ki 1
 5 lakh Hindu Bangladeshi can damage a state like Assam
 keval rohingya hi kyon, sarkaar ko bangladesh se aae un tamaam ghuspaithiyon ko bhi baahar nikaal dena chahie jo aarthik vajahon se hindustan main daakhil hue hai
 "according to Rahul Raj, director of the Delhi-based Indian Institute of Human Rights, Hindustan was receiving Myanmar's jihadist training as a responsible global force
 2013 main jab upie satta main tha, tathakthith rohingya solidarity orgenigeshan (aresao) ke liye kaam karne vaale ek shaks khali mahmud se dilli police kii poochtacha main bhi rohingya ugravadiyon ke pakistan ke saath judaav ke saboot saamne aae the
 Human rights activists believe that it is in the government's authority to take action against any foreigner for 'anti-national' work, but they feel that it is unfair to call the entire community as terrorists
 deva kehete hai, ''agar kuch nishchit rohingyaon ke aatanki gatividhiyon main shaamil hone kii thos jaankaree maujuud he, to unhen daakhil hone se rokna or waapas bhej dena chahie
 But it is illegitimate to impose the threat of security to the entire section of people as a potential threat to security
 sarkaar jaanch-padtaal kii behatar vyavastha to beshak kaayam hi kar sakati he
 "following the order of 8 August, two Rohingya refugees living in India — Mohammed Salimullah and Mohammed Shakir — filed a petition in the Supreme Court seeking assurances from the government that they would not be deported back to Myanmar
 in donon sharnaarthiyon ke naam yuanechasiaar main darj hai
 In response, the government on 16 September filed a 16-page affidavit stating that the government would present evidence of the involvement of Rohingyas with 'militant groups' and the proceeds from illegal routes
 halafname main yah bhi kaha gaya ki sarkaar ke paas suraksha agenciyon or duusare bharosemand sroton ke ikattha kiye gaye saboot hai jo bataate hai ki kuch rohingya pravaasiyon ke taar pakistan se sanchalit aatanki sanghathanon or duusare deshon se kaam kar rahe aise hi sanghathanon ke saath jude hue hai
 It was also said that there were reports of Rohingya being involved in ISIS and other "militant groups" conspiracies to incite communal and fiscidious bloodshed
 javaabi yachika main un do rohingya pravaasiyon ne kaha ki ve ''mahaj gaiyrkanoonee pravasi bhar nahin" hai kyonki ve bheeshan daman or katleam ke bich myanmar se bhagkar aae hai
 This entitles them to protection under several international treaties based on the principle of non-refoulement or non-withdrawal
 non-rifoulment yaa gaiyr-vaapasi ke siddhant ke mutabik, sharan maangane vaale kisi bhi shaks ko us desh main waapas nahin bheja ja saktaa jahaan unki ''nasl, majahab, rashtriyata, kisi khaas saamaajik samooh kii sadsyta yaa siyaasi raay kii vajah se jindagi yaa aazaadee ko khatra ho
 "although Hindustan has not signed the 1951 United Nations Refugee Treaty, the UNHCR said in a statement in Delhi that the principle of non-refoulement is part of prevailing international law and applies to all countries, even if they have signed the treaty Whether signed or not sheersh adaalat ko die apane halafname main centre sarkaar ne daawa kiya ki vah is siddhant ko maanane ke liye baadhya nahin he kyonki bharat ne jis naagarik or rajnatik adhikaron par antarrashtriya samjhaute par dastakhat kiye hai, usamen yah shaamil nahin he
 In addition, even under the 1951 Treaty, the policy of non-refoulement is not unhindered but imposes restrictions on national security concerns
 alabatta duniya bhar main ho rahi aalochana or desh ke bheetar dabaavon kii vajah se—rashtriya maanavadhikaar ayog ne 18 agast ko rohingya sharnaarthiyon ko waapas bhejne ke faisle ko lekar grih mantralay ko notice jari kar diya—sarkaar ko apana rukh naram karne ko majaboor hona padaa
 "we have asked the states to find out all the illegal migrants and take action under the established procedures," says Kiran Rijiju, Union Minister of State for Home Affairs
 isamen kisi khaas samudaay kii koi baat nahin he
 "in a written statement to India Today, the UNHRC said that it had not received any official information from the government regarding any change in the government's stand on the issue of refugees and also any cases of evacuation of Rohingya recorded in UNHCR from India
 No information

 Two Lucknow-based social workers have approached the Reserve Bank of India against HSBC on allegations of black money in bank accounts in Stijerland
 kaaryakartaaon ne kaha ki unhone is bare main rigerv bank ko tab patr likhaa he jab isse pehle echesbisi ne unki shikaayat main lagaaye gayi sabhi aaropon ko khaarij kar diya
 He cited the response to the first complaint by HSBC, stating that HSBC has stated that it seriously complies with the law wherever it operates
 nae varisht vaishvik netritv vaali team or pichley saal nai ranneeti ke jariye echesbisi ne anupaalan ko kadaa karne ke liye pukhta kadam uthaae hai
 The activists say that HSBC India's response came when the Reserve Bank asked it to look into the complaint
 unhone phir se rigerv bank ko shikaayat bheji he kyonki unki shikaayat ke mul mudde par jawaab nahin diya gaya
 The complainants have cited Aam Aadmi Party convenor Arvind Kejriwal in his complaint, in which HSBC has been criticized for its facility to keep black money deposits in Swiss bank branches in Switzerland

 Now that it seemed that there are no more obstacles in the way of an ambitious tax system in place of the separate taxes levied by the Central and State Governments on goods and services, then only two incidents have come in the way of the election of Bihar Assembly bjp's tremendous defeat and the chairman of the state finance ministers' committee

 Hence, the GST tax bill first introduced by the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government in 2000 will not only miss the April 2016 deadline set by the Narendra Modi government, but experts have expressed speculation from India Today that it could now hang till October 2017 is
 is niraashajanak andeshe ke kai kaaran hai
 One of these is that the government will have to opt for Mani from the non-nda members as per tradition
 uske baad, vidheyak ko rajyasabha main paarit karaane ke liye do-tihaai bahumat kii jarurat hogi
 The NDA is seven members behind this as Congress, Left parties and AIADMK are against the bill
 phir ab bihar main baari jeet ke baad vidheyak kaa pehle samarthan karne vaale jedy(you) ke 12 rajyasabha sadasyon ke samarthan kii bhi guarantee nahin he
 Equally important will be special technology arrangements to implement this tax reform and preparation of all industrial and service sectors to accept these taxes
 kai tarah kii vastuon kaa utpaadan karne vaale maharashtra or gujarat jaise rajya pehle hi is sambhaavna se bhadke hue hai ki ve apane rajya main utpaadit vastuon par milane vaale kar se vanchit ho jaaenge
 Gujarat has opposed the tax regime based on the whereabouts of consumption in the Bill
 asal main is vyavastha main pashchim bengal jaise mukhya rup se “upbhog” karne vaale rajyon ko jiesti rajasav hissedari main laabh mil saktaa he jabaki “utpaadan” karne vaale rajyon ko kar rajasav main ghaataa ho saktaa he
 The Center has reportedly agreed to give Gujarat an additional GST share in tax revenue in addition to the same GST share for two years
 lekin vah abhi tak is par apni rajamandi nahin jaahir kar paaya he
 Economy Benefit The implementation of GST was being promoted as the single biggest reform to benefit the country's economy
 godarej industries ke chairman adi godarej kaa maananaa he, “jiesti ke jariye ham desh main vikaas kii dar ko dohare ankon main le ja sakenge or baaki chijen apane aap sudhar jaaengi
 “its basic idea is to create a joint, cooperative and undivided Indian market to strengthen the economy
 kansalting form kepiemji main paroksh kar ke pramukh sachin menon kehete hai, “ek baar jiesti lagu ho jaae to har sauda is kar vyavastha ke tahat aa jayega
 "at this time it becomes easy for many people to avoid tax because they fall in different jurisdictions of the Center and the state
 isko kaale dhan se nibatane ke bhi majboot hathiyaar ke rup main dekha ja rahaa he
 Many people are insisting on fixing the GST rate to 20 percent, although the Congress is in favor of increasing it to 18 percent
 centre or rajyon ke bich hue pehle ke vichaar-vimarsh main jiesti kii dar ko 25 se 26 pratishat nirdhaarit karne kii raay jaahir kii gai thi
 But experts said that this rate was going to harm the basic concept of GST
 aditya birla samooh ke mukhya arthshaastri ajit ranade kaa kahana he, “jiesti kanoon ko koi nishchit dar nirdhaarit karne se bachanaa chahie or sirf yah kahana chahie ki dar pratispardhi hogi or antarrashtriya maanakon tathaa rajasav nirpekshata ke vichaar ke anuroop hogi
 "apart from the rates, the Congress also wants some more changes in the bill, including a system of compensation for municipalities and panchayats and the formation of an independent dispute settlement system
 jiesti main deree kitni mahangi pad sakati he? itane vyapak str ke kisi bhi kar sudhaar main aisa to nahin ki pehle hi din se kar sangrah main koi ullekhneey vruddhi ho jaaegi
 However, many estimate that tax collection will increase by 30 to 40 percent
 yah usee vruddhi ke anuroop he jab rajyon ne 2003 main bikri kar ko chhodkar waite ko apanaaya tha
 India's indirect tax collection in April to August 2015 was Rs 54,396 crore, a 37 per cent increase over the previous year as a result of the increase in excise duty due to additional revenue measures
 jiesti lagu hone ke baad isamen or teji aegi
 For the government, service tax is a means of increasing the additional income and if it is not implemented then the rates of excise duty can increase and the state governments can increase the sales tax to compensate for the revenue loss
 upabhoktaaon par asarlekin sabase bada nuksaan to khud upabhoktaaon kaa hoga
 1 to average prices of consumer goods from GST
 5 se 2 fisadi kii kami aane kii sambhaavna vyakt kii ja rahi he
 About 70 percent of our consumption is spent on food, clothing and other consumer goods and only 30 percent on consumption services
 jiesti ke lagu hone ke baad utpaadan kar, jo abhi 28 fisadi he, 20 fisadi par aa jayega or seva kar, jo abhi 14 fisadi he, 20 fisadi kii dar par pahunch jayega
 Amit Kumar Sarkar, partner at advisory firm Grant Thornton India and head of indirect tax, says, "consumers in the country will directly benefit from 3 to 5 per cent
" ” isse mahangaai kaa dabaav kam ho saktaa he, jisase madhya varg ke logon ko zyada kharch karne kaa protsaahan mil saktaa he or jidipi dar ko kam se kam 1
 a boost of 5 to 2 percent is expected
 kai logon kaa yah bhi kahana he ki sarkaar ko jiesti ke karadhaan kaa dayera badhaakar zyada se zyada vastuon va sevaaon ko iske daayre main lekar aana chahie
 As stated in some reports, keeping the petroleum products, electricity and real estate out of it, may substantially undermine the objective of GST
 sarkaar kaa daawa he ki is kar ko lagu karne ke liye praudyogikeey dhaancha taiyaar kiya ja chukaa he
 1,380 crore to build and maintain GST technology network for five years
 kaa qaraar pehle hi saftware company infosis ko diya ja chukaa he
 The government has also set up an organization called GST Network, which will serve as a technological base for implementing GST and interconnect the databases of the Center and the states
 ab yahi baaki rah gaya he ki jiesti vidheyak ko paarit karwaane ke liye vipaksh kaa samarthan jutaya jaae, par sarkaar ab tak isamen naakaam rahi he, khaas taur par bhoomi adhigrahan vidheyak ke maamle main use munh kii khaani padi he
 Ranade says that the Congress and the BJP should agree to a mutual interest in the country as both parties have already agreed to one percent compensation in lieu of central sales tax
 yah shart congress kii kathith purvasharton main se ek thi
 This is a very positive thing for those states which fear a significant revenue loss
 vaise bhi jiesti upie sarkaar ke agenda main tha lekin tab vah bijepi ke virodh ke kaaran atak gaya tha
 Now the Congress is adopting the same attitude
 par asli dikkat endie sarkaar ke ravaie ko bataaya ja rahaa he
 However, now the government is planning to convene a meeting of leaders of all the major opposition parties so that important Bills and the functioning of Parliament can be discussed
 yah swaagatyogy he
 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has said that he is ready to negotiate with anyone including Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi to remove the deadlock over the bill
 unhone 16 november ko ek saakshaatkaar main yah bhi daawa kiya ki sarkaar ke paas vidheyak ko paarit karne ke liye sadan main jaruri sankchaya he, “jis din us par rajyasabha main charchaa hogi or us par voting kii jaaegi, mujhe rattibar andeh nahin he ki use manjuuri mil jaaegi
 The number is in our favor

 mana ja rahaa he ki tejasvi yadav nitish sarkaar ke khilaaf jo report card pesh karenge usamen sabase bada mudda hoga haal ke dinon main bihar main hue sampradayik dange, jisaki vajah se nitish kumaar kii kaaphi kirakiri ho rahi he
 The communal riots that started in Bhagalpur on March 17 and after the festival of Ramnavmi followed by Tejashwi Yadav will surround Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on the issue of communal violence spread in about 8 districts of the state
 gauratlab he ki 2005 main jab mukhyamantri ke taur par nitish kumaar ne bihar kii kaman sanbhali thi or 2017 ke bich bihar main sampradayik dangon kii ghatana kabhi bhi sunne ko nahin mili
 But there have been many cases of communal violence in the state since the coalition with the BJP again last year
 report card main tejasvi yadav is baat ko lekar charchaa kar sakate hai ki kis tareeke se nitish kumaar ne bhaajapa or RSS ke saamne ghutane tech die hai
 Due to which incidents of communal violence are continuously happening in the state and Nitish who claims good governance is unable to stop such incidents
 sampradayik hinsa kii ghatnaon ke alaava haal hi main ucchtam nyaayalay dwaara anusuchit jati or janajati ko lekar kanoon main badlaav ko lekar bhi tejasvi yadav nitish sarkaar ke khilaaf hallaa bolenge or report card main is baat kaa zikr hoga ki bihar main pichley kuch vakt main kis tareeke se daliton ke khilaaf atyaachaar badha he
 In the report card, Tejashwi Yadav will also present an account of our work for the last 8 months of the Bihar government
 pradesh main pichley kuch maheenon main jis tareeke se kai ghotaale saamne aae hai, isko lekar bhi tejasvi yadav report card main zikr karenge
 The creation scam, toilet scam, dustbin scam, scholarship scam have to be reported
 biharko vishesh rajya kaa darja ab tak nahin die jane ke mudde ko bhi report card main tejasvi yadav uthaaenge
 Tejashwi Yadav will raise the issue of non-development despite the formation of double engine government in the state and will mention that despite the government of double engine, Bihar has not got the status of special state till now

 in teenon ghatnaon ko railway keala afasarakahin naa kahin aapas main jod kar dekh rahe hai
 While the railways is troubled by recurring train accidents, on the 1st of January in the new year, there was an incident which brought previous railway accidents under suspicion
 1 janvari ko raat 12:10 par uttar purv railway ke tahat kalyanpur or mandhana railway steshnon ke bich main 3 jodi fish plate fatty hui pai gai or railway patari ko kaata gaya
 Actually, during track patrolling, trackmen Sanjeev Kumar and Ramraj found 50 rail clips uprooted from the railway tracks and also found 3 pairs of fish plates torn

 In such a situation, this thing is not able to get around the neck of the railway officials
 21 ways the train derailed on this railway track
 haalanki is rail haadase kii jaanch kamishnar railway sefti kar rahe hai
 But the railway officials are doubting this right from Dabi Juban

 ayodhya masale main samjhaute kii koshishon ko bada jhatka laga he kyonki is maamle main donon taraf se muqadama lard rahe chaar bade daavedaaron nirmohi akhaada, viechpi, hindu mahasabha or sunni central vaqf board ne kisi tarah ke samjhaute se inkaar kar diya he
 The Nirmohi Akhara and the VHP have said that their medicine is on the disputed land, so both the temple and the mosque do not accept them there
 maaloom ho ki ayodhya main hanuman gadhi ke mahant or nirmohi akhaade ke rashtriya adhyaksh mahant gyaandas or babari masjid muqadame ke sabase buzurg pairokaar hashim ansaari ne vivaadit zamin par agal-bagal mandir masjid or unke bich 100 fit kii diwaar uthaane kii peshkash kii thi
 Mahant Gyandas is the president of the Akhara Council of which Nirmohi Akhara is a member
 isliye vah nirmohi akhaade kii taraf se yah peshkash kar rahe the
 Four Muslim advocates claimed ownership of the Babri mosque the same year in 1961, when the song "dharmaputra" in the country, "this is a mosque, and that fetish, whether it is as if it was a superhit," was the same year
 unka kahana tha ki masjid main murtiyon rakh di gai hai
 That mosque is not a fetish
 saalon se yah tay nahin ho paaya he ki vahaan kiske khuda kii ibaadat ho
 As soon as the news of the settlement negotiations came, it started getting sharp reactions from all sides
 nirmohi akhaade ke mahant ramdaas ne kaha, "samjhaute kii koi bhi koshish sirf unheen teen logon ke bich ho sakati he, jinhen hai court ne apane faisle main vivaadit zamin kaa ek tihaai hissaa diya he
 Since this land has been given to the VHP and Sunni Central Waqf Board on behalf of Nirmohi Akhara, Ramlala Virajaman, only he can enter into any agreement, not Mahant Gyan Das
 or chunki hamaara daawa puri zameen par mandir kaa he isliye ham vahaan mandir-masjid donon banane kaa koi samjhauta nahin kar sakate

 Former Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal finally returned to where he had left
 kejariwal ne aakhirkaar central dilli ke tilak len ke us sarkari awaas se apana saamaan samet liya, jahaan par vah janvari main bataur dilli ke mukhyamantri ke taur par rahane aae the
 Arvind Kejriwal has now returned with his entire family to the same flat in Girnar Apartment, Kaushambi, Ghaziabad, UP from where he came
 arvind kejariwal farvari main sarkaar se istifa dene ke baad se har maheene 85,000 rupee kiraaya dekar rah rahe the, sarkari awaas par naitikta kaa hawala dekar sawaal uth rahe the, aakhir jab kejariwal siem nahin to sarkari awaas khaali kyon nahin kar rahe hai
 At first Kejriwal was busy in the elections, later he cited the examination of the daughter and when the examination was done, the problem came to light that he was not getting a house in Delhi
 ek makaan mayur vihaar main mila, lekin baad main uske liye bhi na kerani padi kyonki us makaan main avaidh nirmaan tha
 The deal to rent a house in the civil lines of Delhi was officially done, but later he got caught in the property dispute of two brothers and Kejriwal backed out of it
 asal main kuch or bhi vajah thi, jisaki vajah se arvind kejariwal apane parivaar ke liye dilli main kiraye kaa makaan nahin talash paae
 The first was that Arvind Kejriwal had to keep in mind that the place where he lived should be easily accessible
 saath hi vahaan ke aasapaas ke log or maahaul aisa ho ki bheedbhad hone par logon ko dikkat na ho
 Arvind has a total of six members in his family, so a 3–4-room house was compulsory
 baat yah bhi rahi ki kejariwal ab purv mukhyamantri hone ke saath hi ek party pramukh bhi hai or pratishthit nai dilli vidhansabha seat se vidhayak bhi hai, isliye unako ghar main hi ek offis bhi rakhana hoga jiske liye jagah honi chihie
 And the biggest thing is that the house should not be a victim of criticism
 ab itani sari sharton, vivaadon or paristhitiyon main kejariwal kam se kam dilli main kiraye kaa makaan nahin dhund paae or laut gaye vahiin jahaan se aae the
 This flat has been allotted in the name of Kejriwal's IRS wife and was the same as before, although his close relatives consider his Kaushambi residence as auspicious for him, because while staying there he worked on issues like Right to Information Act, Lokpal movement Got fame aam aadmi party banaai
 The party surprised everyone by winning 28 seats in the first time and upon seeing Kejriwal became the CM of Delhi
 jabaki tilak len main jane ke baad aalochana, vivaad haaavee rahe or sarkaar se istipha, party kii loksabhaa main karaari haar jaisi ghatnaayen hui jisase kejariwal or party kaa manobal or janata main bharosa tutaa
 Now it has to be seen whether returning to Kaushambi, UP will be auspicious for Kejriwal? pradesh adhyaksh ne beniwal ko di hidayatakaha, bhaajapa akele chunaav ladane main sakshambhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) loksabhaa chunaav main rashtriya loktantric party (aralapi) ke saath gathbandhan kar maidan main utari thi
 Now civic elections are going to be held in the state
 aralapi ke hanuman beniwal kii ore se kii ja rahi bayaanbajiyon ke bich gathbandhan ke bhavishya par atakalein lagaai jane lagi thim
 In the midst of all this, BJP state president Dr Satish Puniyane has clarified that the party is capable of contesting elections alone
 unhone kaha ki nikaay chunaav main party akele chunaav ladegi
 Will not be aligned with RLP
 doctor punia ne kaha ki abhi gathbandhan kii aavashyaktaa nahin mahasoos ho rahi
 There is no initiative for alliance on our side
 unhone aralapi ke hanuman beniwal ko hidaayat bhi di, ki vah bhaajapa ke andruni maamalon main dakhlandaji na karen
 He should desist from it
 beniwal ke badbolepan se liya faisla?doctor punia ke is bayaan ko beniwal ke badbolepan se jodakar dekha ja rahaa he
 This discussion has been strengthened by the way Poonia instructed Beniwal
 gauratlab he ki loksabhaa chunaav ke baad vidhansabha upachunaav main bhi bhaajapa or aralapi ne milakar chunaav ladaa tha
 Beniwal has often taken an attacking stand with former Chief Minister Vasundhara Rajeko
 bhaajapa netaaon par lagaaya tha bhitarghaat kaa aaropahaal hi main khinvsar seat ke liye upachunaav hua, jahaan se hanuman beniwal ke bhai narayan beniwal ummidavaar the
 Narayan also won the election, but the margin of victory was small
 ise lekar beniwal ne bhaajapa netaaon par bhitarghaat kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 There was also anger among BJP leaders
 nagaur se saansad hai beniwalpradesh kii 25 main se ek seat bhaajapa ne aralapi ko di thi
 RLP Sehuman Beniwal won the Nagaur parliamentary seat defeating Jyoti Mirdha of the Congress
 isi maah do vidhansabha siton ke liye hue upachunaav main bhi yah gathbandhan jari rahaa or bhaajapa ne khinvsar seat aralapi ke liye chhod di thi

 ' kisaanon ke karj maafee kaa vaada congress ke liye vidhansabha chunaavon main jeet ke ahm kaarnon main se ek rahaa
 But is Rahul Gandhi withdrawing from his promise that the debt waiver promise of farmers will be fulfilled within 10 days of the formation of new Congress governments? Such a claim is being made on behalf of thousands of people on social media
 darasal bhraamak sandesh dene ke liye do clips ko jodakar video taiyaar kiya gaya
 In a video uploaded by two well-known right-wing Facebook pages - 'modinama' and 'nation with Namo', it was claimed that Rahul had backed down from his promise of debt waiver
 in pejon kii ore se share kiya gaya video do alag video clips ko jod kar banaaya gaya
 The first clip is of a public meeting of Rahul in Chhattisgarh
 vahiin doosraa clip mangalvaar ko vidhansabha chunaav nattejey aane ke baad dilli main rahul kii press conference kaa he
 In the shared video of modinama, the accompanying message is - 'promise se palate Rahul'
 43 second ke video main ‘pehle’ or ‘baad’ ke rahul ke video dete hue saath daawa kiya gaya- “jeet ke 24 ghante ke andar hi dikhaa pappu kaa asli rang
 Using the same video on the Nation with namo page, the title was given - within 24 hours of the results came back from the promise of debt waiver
 modinama pej kii pehali windo main die video ke saath sheershak diya gaya he- ‘chunaav jeetne se pehle
 'in this video, a part of Rahul's election speech has been taken
 isamen rahul ko ye vaada karte suna ja saktaa he ki congress agar satta main aati he 10 din ke andar hi kisaanon ke karj maaf kar die jaaenge
 In the second window of the Modinama page, the video is titled - 'after winning the election
 ’ is video main rahul gandhi kii press conference kaa chota sa hissaa liya gaya he, jisamen unhen kehete suna ja saktaa he ki ‘karj maafi samaadhaan nahin he
 By the time this report was written, this post has been shared 22,000 times on Facebook
 modinama ke 19 lakh folbers hai
 The India Today Fact Check team found in its investigation that the post of 'modinama' is misleading
 chunaav prachaar ke dauraan rahul ne congress ke satta main aane par kisaanon ke karj 10 din main maaf karne kaa vaada kiya tha
 At the press conference after the results came out, Rahul reiterated his promise
 lekin saath hi unhone kaha ki ‘karj maafee’ kisaanon kii dikkaton kaa samaadhaan nahin he balki ‘sahaara dene kaa sirf ek kadam’ he
 The first part of the viral video is part of Rahul Gandhi's election speech in Chhattisgarh
 isamen unhone pradhanmantri narendra modi par ‘kisaanon ke karz maaf karne main naakaam rahane’ kaa aarope lagaate hue hallaa bolaa
 Then promised that if the Congress came to power, the farmers' debts would be forgiven in 10 days
 video ke doosraa hissaa rahul gandhi kii press conference se liya gaya jiseyahandekha ja saktaa he
 In a 14-minute press conference, Rahul Gandhi reiterated his promise of debt waiver and said that the process would be started with the formation of the government
 haalanki press conference main ek sawaal kaa jawaab dete hue rahul ne saaf kiya, ‘maine apane chunavi bhaashanon main bhi kaha he ki karj maafee sahaara dene kaa ek kadam he
 Debt forgiveness is not the solution
 kisaanon kii takalifon kaa samaadhaan bahut jatil prakriya hoga
 The solution will come from creating infrastructure and bringing technology to farmers
 ’rahul ke isi jawaab se ye hissaa liya gaya ki karj maafee samaadhaan nahin he
 And then he was selected and used to make misleading videos
 india today fact check team kii padtaal se sabit hua ki rahul gandhi karj maafee ke apane vaade se peeche nahin hate hai or viral video bhraamak he

 In the last three years, the death of j Jayalalithaa and m Karunanidhi, among the biggest leaders of Tamil Nadu politics, has brought a vacuum in the state's politics
 jise bharne ke liye kai yuva rajaneta qatari main khadey dikhte hai
 In this episode, where on one side there are E
 Palaniswami and O
 Panneerselvam, on the other side there are youth like Stalin

 a wide disparity can be expected in the performance of the winning party and runner-up in every state of the country
 beete kuch chunaav ke aankadon par najar daalen to pataa chalata he ki 1952 se ab tak hue chunaav main har rajya main kisi ne kisi party ko bada bahumat mila he
 On the basis of Lok Sabha elections, the winning party in 77% of the states of the country has got twice as many seats as compared to the losing party
 apane pratidwandi se jeet ke maamle main duusare rajyon kii tulana tamilnadu sheersh sthaan par he
 Not only this, Tamil Nadu has won the winning party with a big margin
 abhi tak hue chunaav main party ko mili jeet main se 94 fisadi jeet badi thi
 Despite all this, mainstream parties like Congress and BJP have not benefited from this rise of the state in decades
 kshetriy party ke is utthan kaa khamiyaja raashtra str kii partiyon ko bhi uthaanaa padaa he
 This is the reason that at one time the Congress whose total vote share in the state was around 20 percent has now come down to less than four percent
 jabaki tamilnadumein bijepi kabhi bhi apni maujuudagi nahin darj kara pai
 However, the BJP did tie up with the AIADMK
 1998 main ediemke ne atal bihari vaajapeyi kii endie ko apana samarthan jarur diya tha
 But after 13 months, he had also pulled his support
 jis vajah se vaajapeyi sarkaar sansad main vishwaas mat nahin jeet pai thi or sarkaar 1999 main gir gai thi
 At the time of Jayalalithaa, the AIADMK gained 10 percent among the female voters

 Tamil Nadu has 10 bellwester seats - one of which correctly predicted the results of 11 Lok Sabha elections

 jail main band ram rahim par ab tak kaa sabase chaunkaane vaala khulaasa hua he
 a conspiracy has been uncovered that was hatched within the dera 16 years ago, but Parwan could not
 us daur ke ek pratibhashali chaatr ko apana chela banaakar ram rahim tabaahi kaa wo saamaan hasil karnaa chahta tha, jo uske ishaare par maut barsaata
 When the stock of weapons was seized from Ram Rahim's camp, everyone was surprised as to why there was a need for so many guns in the ashram of Ram Rahim, who describes himself as a saint
 lekin isse aage kaa sach sunakar aapke hosh hi ud jaaenge
 Because Ram Rahim's preparation was not just guns, but more than that, he had to raise a cache of bombs and missiles
 sunne main kitna bhi atapata lage lekin ram rahim ke saikadon raaj main se ek ye bhi he ki khud ko massenger of god bataane vaala shaks aisi tabaahi kii sajeesh rach rahaa tha ki yadi wo kaamyaab ho jaati to na jane kya ho jaataa
 This plan with the destruction of Ram Rahim has been revealed by Virender Singh, resident of Kaithal
 16 saal pehle virendra jab schuli chaatr the to apni pratibha ke dam par surkhiyon main chaa gaye the
 He had designed models of missiles and new types of tanks during his school days
 science acjibishan main rakhe unke model tatkaaleen raashtrapati apije abdul kalam ne bhi dekha or unke dimag kii daad di thi
 Missile models were fiercely discussed
 ye vahi daur tha jab ram rahim kaa sitara bulandiyon par chadhana shuru hua tha
 Thanks to the blessings of power and luck, the number of supporters of Ram Rahim Teji was moving rapidly from lakhs to crores
 aise main virendra kii research ke bare main sunakar ram rahim ke dimag main shaitani sajeesh janm lene lagi
 He put his people behind Virendra
 un dinon main ram rahim ke aabhamandal ko dekhte hue virendra ne bhi uskaa nyaute sweekaar kar liya
 After taking admission in the ashram school, he started working on his research
 ram rahim ne virendra ko apane ashram main khaas darja diya tha
 Virendra had the freedom to go anywhere in the ashram unabated
 ram rahim aksar usase research ke bare main baat karata tha
 Now the question arises that why Ram Rahim, who had charged lakhs in the name of school in Dera, lured Virendra for free education
 kya baba virendra kii pratibha kaa galat phayda uthaane kii firaaq main tha? kya virendra kii madad se apane liye missile banvaanaa chahta tha? kya ram rahim sarkaar or prashasan se bhavishya main hone vaali jang kii taiyaari kar rahaa tha?16 saal pehleram rahimake nyaute par deraa gaye virendra kii maane to sach vaaki itnaa hi khatarnaak tha, jise wo us vakt samaj nahin paaya tha
 It was a privilege that the empire of hypocrisy and lies in the camp opened the eyes of Virendra who came to research soon
 kareeb saal bhar main hi virendra ne dere ko alavida kah diya tha
 Ram Rahim's dream remained a dream

 ' rahul gandhi ke saath islamic vidwaanon kii baithak main shaamil hone vaale irfan habib ne kaha ki unhen alpsankhyak samaaj ke buniyadi masalon ko uthaanaa chahie
 In a conversation with Aaj Tak, Irfan Habib said on Thursday that the Congress President was advised to raise the basic issue of Muslims
 unhone kaha ki sikh or isai samudaay kii tarah musalmaan bhi is desh ke naagarik hai
 Muslims also face the same problems that every citizen has to face
 musalamaanon ke saamne garibi, berogari or suraksha kaa mudda sabase ahm he
 Explain that Rahul had a meeting with Muslim intellectuals on Wednesday
 rahul gandhi ko salaahirfan habib ne rahul gandhi se kaha, musalmaan bhi aaj khud ko utana hi asurakshit mahasoos kar rahaa he jitna dalit
 What is the reason for this, some people know it, while some other people should try to know it
 irfan habib ne kaha, 'agar aap (rahul) musalamaanon kii baat karnaa chaahate hai to un logon kii baat kiijie jo darkinar kiye gaye hai
 You can also talk to them by calling them Muslims or you can say those who are poor and backward and feel insecure
 tab logon ko lagegaa ki aap desh kii baat kar rahe hai or sirf alpsankhyakon kii baat nahin kar rahe hai
 The historian said, those who are accusing the Congress or other parties of appeasement of the minorities, in fact the same people are appeasing the majority
 unhone kaha, kya bahusnkhyakon kaa tushtikaran rashtrawaad he?irfan habib ne rahul gandhi ko salaah dete hue kaha ki yah is tarah kaa casette he jise aap baar baar nahin chalaa sakate hai
 You cannot live in history nor bring it back, but take lessons from it
 indira gandhi kaa jamaana waapas nahin aa saktaa
 But taking lessons from that era, the mistakes committed by the Congress need to be rectified
 unhone kaha ki sirf congress hi nahin balki duusari partiyaan bhi jab musalmaan kii baat karti hai to vah dadhi or topi waalon ko dhundne nikal jaati hai
 They bring people with beard hats who have no connection with Muslims
 vah log choti-choti sansthaaon kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai jinhone apni dukaan banaai hui he
 Irrfan Habib said, 'I do not think that bearded caps should be considered representative of Muslims
 dadhi topi ek dharmik pratik he
 Those who use beard caps are evil and should also be criticized who bring them to the forums and use them
 'irfan habib ne dharm ke naam par kii jane vaali raajnneeti par naaraazgi jaahir kii
 He said that there should not be politics in the name of Muslims, religion and church
 isse raajnneetik dhruvikaran hota he
 In such a situation Hindu becomes Hindu
 musalmaan, musalmaan ban jaataa he or koi hindustani nahin rah jaataa
 He said, 'in yesterday's meeting i mentioned that whether it is personal law, Aligarh University or Urdu issue, it is not the issue of ordinary Muslims
 aam musalamaanon kaa mudda vahi he jo aam hinduon kaa he jisamen roji roti or suraksha pehle he
 'irfan Habib said,' We advised him to talk on basic issues which include issues like education, employment
 rahul gandhi in masalon par sahamat the or unhone kaha bhi ki vah bhi aisa hi sochate hai
 "rahul is reforming the party, Irfan Habib," Rahul Gandhi said that we are improving and will try to raise these issues
 ' unhone bataaya, 'sab kii baat sunne ke baad rahul gandhi ne kaha ki ham sudhaar karenge or hamen pataa he ki hamane kahaan galtiyaan kii hai
 Those mistakes we are trying to fix, we are talking of taking everyone along
 'kul milakar aisa laga ki shaayad aatmachintan kii baat he or congress akele apane balboote par sirf ladaai nahin lard sakati he
 He has to fight together and it seems to be self-conscious
 yah sahi bhi he kyonki jin rajyon main congress apane balboote akele lard sakati he, uske alaava rajyon main use kshetreey partiyon ko saath lekar chalanaa hi hoga
 Swami Chakrapani has advised Congress President Rahul Gandhi to go on a visit to Mansarovar
 muslim buddhijiviyon ke saath baithak par unhone kaha ki congress ne kahin na kahin hinduon kii upeksha kii he
 The Congress gave the name of saffron terrorism and it was the affidavit in the court against Setu Samudram
 aaj modi pradhanmantri or yogi mukhyamantri bane hai, lekin takat un main nahin balki vah takat hindutv main he
 It has to be understood that you should take everyone along, but do not ignore Hindutva

 Delhi Women's Commission chairperson Swati Maliwal has written a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi regarding the violence in the Banaras Hindu University
 mahila ayog kii adhyaksh ne ye chitthee guuruuvaar ko likhi
 Respected Prime Minister, the girls of Banaras Hindu University (BHU) in Uttar Pradesh recently raised their security issues, instead of giving them protection, they were lathi-charged
 yah bahut dukhad ghatana he
 The girls come to study in university like BHU, DU, JNU to make their future by facing big difficulties from village-towns and small towns and assuring their family their safety
 vishvavidhyalayon main hi hamaari betiyaan surakshit nahin rahengi to betiyaan padhane ke liye baahar kaise niklengi
 In such a situation, how will the 'beti Bachao Beti Padhao' campaign of the government succeed
 bchaumen hui chhedchhad kii ghatana pehali baar nahin hui thi, balki kaaphi samay se ladakiyon ke saath is tarah kii ghatnaayen ho rahi thim
 The girl was molested inside the campus on Saturday and despite complaining, the BHU administration did not take any action at that time
 ladakiyon kii shikaayat par jab uniwarsity prashasan ne sunwaayee nahin kii to ve apni aawaaj uniwarsity prashasan tak pahunchane ke liye dharne par baith gayi
 But instead of addressing their grievances, they were lathi charged
 is ghatana se man kaanp uthta he ki aakhir itani beharahami se kaise or kyon nirdosh ladakiyon par lathi barasaai gayi
 It is a matter of shame that the VC of BHU instead of taking the issue seriously, held the girls responsible and made non-sensitive statements in the media
 ek uniwarsity ke visi ke aise bayanon se puure desh kii chaatraon kaa manobal tuutata he
 Repeated molestation of girls is not just an incident of BHU
 pichley ek saptaah main dilli ke do kalejon main ladakiyon kii suraksha ko lekar badi chook hui he
 Around 500 students of Delhi University's Ambedkar College reached the police station demanding a safe environment around the campus
 kyonki is kalege ke campus ke paas aae din ladakiyon ke saath chhedchhad or chhina jhapati kii ghatnaayen hoti rahati hai
 The second incident occurred at the Khalsa College inside the Delhi University Campus, where some people tried to enter the Girls Hostel
 ladakiyon kii suraksha ke mudde saath-saath unke saath deshbhar kii uniwarsities va collejon main jo bhi bhedbhaav ho rahaa he wo bhi ek ahm mudda he
 Many universities and colleges in Delhi are treating girls with discrimination
 dilli main sthit kai uniwarsity va collejon main ladakiyon ke hostel kaa samay ladako ke hostel ke samay se alag he
 When the Delhi Commission for Women asked the reason for discrimination against girls, many universities and colleges argued that due to the safety of girls, it has been made a rule to return to their hostels sooner than boys
 bade dukh kii baat he ki aazaadee ke 70 saal baad bhi ladakiyon ke saath shiksha ke sarvocch sansthaanon main bhedbhaav ho rahaa he
 In the Hindu College of Delhi University, girls are being charged more hostel fees than boys
 ise lekar liye dilli mahila ayog ne ujisi se lekar maanav sansaadhaan vikaas mantralay tak se ladakiyon ke saath ho rahe bhedbhaav ko khatm karwaane kii koshish kii, lekin abhi tak kuch nahin hua
 It has often been seen that when girls are demanded from the university and college administration for their safety, the girls are given orders to hurry to hostels by imposing discriminatory rules
 collejon ke campason main khulaa evam surakshit maahaul dene kii bajaay ladakiyon ke liye piznra banaaya ja rahaa he
 Several levels of effort are required to make the campus safe
 campus ke aasapaas sisitivi lagane, police kii petroling badhanaa or sadakon par roshni karnaa atyant aavashyak he
 The most important thing is that if a girl is molested or any other untoward incident, then the university college administration should be strictly instructed not to suppress such cases but to help the victim girls
 ladakiyon ke liye dilli ke campus-collejon main hi nahin balki deshbhar ke campason main surakshit maahaul bananaa chahie
 Sir, we want -1
 biechayu ke campus main ladakiyon par hue lathicharge ke liye vaais chancelar ko turant barkhaast kar unke khilaaf sakht karrwai kii jaae evam ladakiyon ko suraksha pradaan kii jaye
 2
 dilli nahin balki puure desh main ladakiyon or ladakon ke hostel kii timming ko lekar jo bhedbhaav ho rahaa he use turant khatm kiya jaae
