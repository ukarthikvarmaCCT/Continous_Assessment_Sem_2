 Ved Pratap Vedic, who met the terrorist Hafiz Saeed in Pakistan and made headlines, has again said something that is going to be disputed
 veda pratap vaidic ne kaha he ki jin saansadon ne hafid said se unki mulaakaat kii ninda kii thi, ve maansik taur par asthir hai
 Ved Pratap Vedic did not stop here
 unhone yah tak kah diya ki vivaad ke dauraan unka saansadon ke munh par thukne kaa kar rahaa tha
 It is worth mentioning that Ved Pratap Vedic met Hafiz Saeed, the mastermind of Mumbai attack, in the beginning of July this year
 unhone is meeting kii tasviir soshal media par share kii jise lekar bavaal shuru ho gaya
 Its echo was also heard in Parliament
 vipaksh kaa aarope tha ki yah mulaakaat sarkaar ke jaankaree bina sambhav nahin thi
 However, the NDA government flatly denied this
 veda pratap vaidic ne yah vivaadit bayaan teen divasiy ajmer sahitya mahotsav ke aakhri din diya
 He also said that if a proposal to declare him a 'traitor and a traitor' was brought, he would spit on the mouths of all mps supporting it
 chaahe vah 545 hi kyon naa hon
 Ved Pratap Vedic said that if the present government wants to send him to jail, he would like to keep Manmohan Singh with him in Tihar Jail

 darasal rajya sarkaar ne sangrakshit jangal kshetra main udyog or anya gatividhiyon kii sitambar 1994 main ijazat di thi
 The bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra said in a resentful manner that the government had done nothing on these 'false' claims for 30 years and now the government is requesting to cancel their permission
 hairat kii baat he ki rajya sarkaar ke paas in aavantiyon kii suchi tak nahin he
 When the government told this to the court, Justice Mishra said that on what basis are the officers passing the claims of those allottees? The Supreme Court rebuked that after granting permission 26 years ago, the government slept for so many years and is now suddenly demanding to be canceled
 court ne kaha ki upi sarkaar kaa apane adhikariyon par to niyantran he nahin or ulte court main kah rahi he ki wo duusare paksh ko sune bagaiyr aavanton radd kar de
 The court asked the Yogi government of UP to rate which new projects have still been allowed in which areas
 court ne ye bhi kaha ki NTPC,UPEC jaise sansthaanon ko aankh mundakar projects ke liye jameen de di
 Now, after 26 years, when they are claiming the land, they are ready to unilaterally cancel the claim
 court ne kaha ki vah bina aloty companiyon or logon ko sune bagaiyr is maamle main koi faisalaa yaa aadesh nahin de sakate
 The court said that your negligence will have serious consequences
 aapako bataa den ki uttar pradesh sarkaar renukut-mirzapur ke sangrakshit jangal ke kshetra main july 1994 main udyogon or anya sansthaanon ko bhoomi aavantit karne ke aadesh ko ab khaarij karne kii guhaar supreme court se laga rahi he
 The government has told the Supreme Court that forest officers and district courts are still approving the claims of those institutions while the Supreme Court issued an order on July 19, 1994 prohibiting encroachment of protected forest land
 saath hi yah bhi kaha tha ki is sangrakshit van bhoomi par agast 1994 ke baad kisi kaa koi bhi daawa maanya nahin hoga
 That is, ignoring the 26-year-old Supreme Court's order and disregarding the district court and forest officials for 26 years, they kept watching the state governments silently

 Book: Alice in Corporate (english) Author: Tulika Tripathi Price: Rs 299addition: Hard Bounce, 125 pagepublisher: Penguin Books indiacharles Lutwyz Dogson coined the character of Alice Carroll in 1865, by Lewis Carroll, who created her fantasy world
 elice gaahe-bagaahe hamen aisi jagahon par le jaati he jo asal main hai hi nahin
 But we just follow him like that
 charles ne shaayad hi tab sochaa hoga ki elice kaa kirdaar romani khayalon kii duniya kaa paryaay ban jayega
 a world will remain lost in its own world
 uski jigyaasa yaa kahen ki uski icchhaaen, use ek aparichit duniya kii saiyr karaayengi jinka vajood vastav main kalpana se aage kahin nahin he
 In Tulika Tripathi's book 'alice in Corporateland' we also meet a similar girl Alice who has graduated during the recession
 apni kaamkaaji jindagi kii shuruyaat se thik ek din pehle vah romaanch or kalpanaaon ke bhavasaagar main gote lagaati he or uske chhinten hamaare man ko bhi aanandit karte hai
 Like that legend in the year 1865, in this story, Alice chases the bill of a rabbit and then finds herself in a 'corporate land'
 is jaadui or kaalpanik yatra main elice kii mulaakaat pinokiyo, syndrella, 7 dwarf, rapenjal or peter pan se hoti he, jo use apane andaaj main kariyar sambandhi suzav or prashikshan dete hai
 The book becomes special in the sense that it gives you an experience of adventure as well as the skill of a 'skilled' trainer
 pathakon ko elice se jodne ke liye tulika elice kii sthiti kaa puraa byora detii hai
 For example, it is a time of recession, jobs are not available and Alice is starting her career as an intern
 yah kahani bataati he elice kin tareekon se har pal badalte is 'corporate land' main khud ke liye jagah banaati he
 How she keeps getting better and better herself in the working world and most importantly, you are with her throughout this journey and feel like everything is happening in front of your eyes
 kitaab yaa tulika kii lekhan kala kii khaasiyat yah he ki jaise-jaise elice corporate land kii saiyr par aage nikalati he, uski baarikiyon ko sikhti he, lakshya ke mahatv or dhairya kii mahatta kii use samaj hoti he
 Also, these ideas are communicated in the reader as well
 kitaab ko padhane ke kram main aap yahi sochate hai ki kaash, koi ek shaks aisa hota jo aapako bhi kariyar kii shuruyaat main aise hi 'tips or tricks' ke bare main bataata
 Where is the lack of any creation is not complete in every way
 agar is kitaab kii kamiyon kii charchaa karen to lekhika kai jagahon par yah nirnay nahin le pai hai ki vah ek 'guide book' likh rahi hai yaa romaanchak or kaalpanik katha
 There are many such details or incidents of 'corporate land' in this story that remind you of your past mistake and learning related to it
 lekin iske saath hi kai jagahon par ghatit ho rahi ghatnaayen or kahani kii rup-rekha ke bich jaanwaron or pakshiyon ke saath uskaa saamanjasy bitha paanaa thodaa mushkil jaan padataa he
 Why to read if you are starting your career or you are stuck somewhere in the middle of the career, then this book is for you
 yah aapako suzav detii he or saath hi aapkaa manoranjan bhi karti he
 What is different is not that this is the only book like this
 vikaas swaroop kii 'da accidental aprentis' or aswin sanghi kii 'chanakya chent' ke saath hi kai aisi kitaaben isi kathavstu par likhi gai hai
 But the message of Ellis in Corporate Land and its way of suggesting is different from others

 sachin: a billian drims ek documentry drama he
 This is the story of Sachin Tendulkar, Lord of Cricket
 ek madhyamvargeey parivaar kaa ladkaa kaise shoharat kii bulandiyon par pahunch jaataa he, yah film isi kahani ko dikhaati he
 The film shows Sachin's hard work and states that there is no short-cut for Saplata
 beti sara se shuru hoti he filofilm kii shuruyaat ek video se hoti he, jismensachinaki god main unki nanheen bitiyaa sara hai
 This is a real video and is from the time Sara was born
 sachin ne jab unhen apni god main pehali baar liya tha tab unhone kaha tha ki 'mujhe bahut dar lag rahaa he ise pakadaney main'
 Then the story of the film moves towards Sachin's childhood
 sachin bachapan main kaaphi shararti the
 He used to throw the air out of someone's car
 sachin kii film ke premier kii photosbahana ke bat ne badal di jindagisachin kii jindagi tab badalati he, jab unki badi bahan tohfe main unhen bat detii hai
 After this, Sachin starts playing cricket with his elder brother Ajit
 1983 ke worldcup ne sachin kii jindagi ko ek nai disha di
 He started thinking of cricket as his destination and dreamed of winning the World Cup
 apane guru aachrekar ji ke saath cricket practice se lekar apane pehle match tak pahunchane kaa safar drama form main he
 Most of the original videos are shown later in the film and the story moves forward through different people
 film ke premier parap beti ke bal sanvaarte dikhe sachinmaster-blaster kii life ke romaanchak or imotional pahalu1) sachin bachapan se sabake chahate the
 The parents believed him, he was allowed to do what Sachin wanted him to do
 bade bhai ajit ne unki manzil ko apni manzil mana or hameshaa unka saath diya
 2) The first match of Sachin's life was against Pakistan, when the Pakistani players took him very lightly
 lekin unke bare main wasim akram ne kaha tha ki sachin main unhen mahaan khilaadi banane kaa aks shuru main hi dikh gaya tha
 3) Even after becoming a big player, he loved music
 vaise or unka naam hi mashhoor sangeetkaar sachin dev burman kii vajah se rakhaa gaya tha
 Sachin also sings a song, did you hear his voice 4) Whether it be rain or sunshine towards the game, Sachin never compromised with the cricket practice
 jaldi agar wo out ho jate to kis tarah se apni kaamiyon par kaam karte
 5) How he was as an ideal son, an ideal husband and father of his two children is well depicted
 6) cricket captain banane ke baad kis tarah se kuch senior khilaadi unki baat nahin maanate the or mohammad azahruddin ke saath unki anban bhi bahut salike se dikhaai gai he
 In a real video, Young Sachin is giving an autograph to his fans and sits quietly Azhar beside him
 saath ravi shastri kii camentry jahaan wo ishaaron main kah rahe hai ki saaf dikh rahaa he kis tarah se limlite badal rahi he
 7) The downfall of a successful player is seen when the newspaper's head line started becoming "endulkar" instead of Tendulkar
 us dauraan parivaar ke saath unhonen kaise vakt bitaayaa- ek video main usee dauraan apane bete or beti ke saath koob hansi majaak karte dikhte hai sachin
 8) After the embarrassing defeat in 2007, the hard work of winning the World Cup in 2011 has shown very well
 9) kuch kamaal ke videos jahaan sachin 35 cencheri banane ke baad apane team mets ke saath kek kaat rahe hai , yaa videshi lokation main aam aadmi kii tarah bivi bacchon ke saath gum rahe hai, jo bharat main unke liye munasib nahin he
 10) The pain of losing the father and how he considered his father to be his god
 pehali baar jab hotel ke kamare main sachin kii patni ne unhen apane pita kii maut kii khabar sunai
 
 
 Seeing that moment, the audience could not stop the tears in their eyes
 sitaron se roshan rahi sachin kii partylekin in muddon ko dhundhenge darshak1) sachin or anjali kii prem kahani, bataur putr, pita or pati to wo dikhte hai , lekin prem kahani shuru kaise hui thi wo ansh film main nahin he
 2) Vinod Kambli, who was his childhood friend, definitely has the first major partnership with him but later the rift between him and Kambli is not in the film
 documentry he, dhoni par bani film se tulana naa carendocumentry kii kahani bataanaa mushkil hota he ,lekin nirdeshak james arkaskin ,lekhak sandip sreevastav or sivakumar anant, kii tarif kerani hogi jis tarah se unhone is film main sachin ke bachapan ko drama form main rakhaa he or baad main asal videos ke jariye kahani ko aage badhaayaa he or bich bich main sirf sachin ko hi sutaradhar kii tarah dikhaaya
 Along with the interviews of Sachin's wife and Sachin seniors Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and Ravi Shastri, the story has also made the story interesting, there are also interviews of megastar Amitabh Bachchan with Sachin's Fans where he was telling when Sachin landed on the field Everyone had high expectations
 haa, dhoni kii byopic se is film kii tulana nahin kerani chaiye kyonki wo puri tarah fiction thi
 Sachin became emotional after remembering his father
 
 
 No Stars kyonki sachin ke aage taare fike hai
 
 
 Now the question is how many stars should be given to this film, then the answer is that Sachin's name is enough to see the story of Sachin Tendulkar on screen
 har us shaks ko ye film dekhni hi chaiye jo jindagi main kuch hasil karnaa chahta he

 But when identity, trouble and trouble become a stain, then life becomes difficult
 phir unki to sabase badi pareshaani yahi thi ki unhen puraa samaaj naa to mard maanata tha or naa hi aurat
 So far, in the custom of society, there are only two genders or say that there is only two status
 yani aap yaa to mard ho sakate hai yaa aurat
 But on Tuesday, the country's biggest court gave a third gender i
e
 third status to the country while giving a historic verdict
 ji haa, ab desh main maujuud pachaas lakh se bhi zyada kinnaron ko tisare darje main shaamil kar liya gaya he
 When suddenly she stares at them, sometimes in the crowd, sometimes in the courtyard of the house
 kabhi sadak par tokabhikisi mehfil main
 Sometimes you must have seen those faces darting at the beat of dholak and sometimes at the sound of applause
 ye wo hai jo jab-jab saamne aate hai nazren naa chaahate hue bhi unpar tik jaati hai
 Their identity had become such that every particular person wanted to get rid of them in some way
 lekin jab khud yekisi ke peeche pad jaaen to phir inase peechha chhudaana aasaan nahin hota
 So far in the world and in the world as well as in India, there were only two categories i
e
 two genders and these two claimants ie man and woman had all the necessary identities, rights, facilities, rights
 magar 15 april ko desh kii sabase badi adaalat yani supreme court ne ek aisa aitihaasik faisla sunaaya ki us faisle ke aate hi achaanak ab ek teesraa gender yani tisare darje ne janm le liya he
 Like the backward castes, more than fifty lakh eunuchs have been given the right to live with dignity by raising their heads
 supreme court ne unhen third gender qaraar dekar wo saare adhikaar dene ko kaha he jo pichhadi jatiyon ko hasil hai
 These include education, health, jobs, reservation
 itnaa hi nahin supreme court ne apane faisle main kinnaron ko baccha god lene kaa adhikaar dene ke saath-saath unhen sex change karwaakar aurat yaa mard banane kaa bhi adhikaar de diya he
 The Kinnar community had been fighting for this right for years
 1871 se pehle tak bharat main kinnaron ko transgender kaa adhikaar mila hua tha
 But in 1871, the British placed the eunuchs in the category of criminal tribes, ie Jarayampesha tribe
 baad main aaazaad hindustan kaa jab nayaa samvidhan bana to 1951 main kinnaron criminal tribs se nikaal diya gaya
 But he did not get his right even then
 haalanki tab se ab tak ye kinnar usee duniya main rah rahe the, jisamen ham or aap rahete hai
 But we meet you and you only on the occasion of happiness
 marji se yaa jabardastee
 The work of those who are considered unlucky is just to pray
 lekin in dua dene waalon kaa bhi ek sach he
 40-50 thousand kinnars every year, but how? For us and you, eunuchs are just eunuchs
 zyaadaatar log yaa to kinnaron kaa saamana karne sebachate hai yaa phir unase nafrat karte hai
 There is hardly anyone who tries to get to know the eunuchs closely
 shaayad hi koi ho jisane kinnaron kii duniya main jhaankne kii koshish kii ho
 The truth of the world of Kinnars is very frightening and revealing
 desh main har saal kinnaron kii sankhya main 40-50 hajaar kii vruddhi hoti he
 Out of all the corners of the country, 90 percent are such that they are made
 philhal desh main kinnaron kii chaar deviyaan hai
 Over time, people who have a zana sense have also joined the Kinnar fraternity
 kinnaron kii duniya ke apane kanoon hai or apane rivaaj
 When the death of the kinners is not shown to any non-kinner
 aisa mana jaataa he ki aisa karne se marane vaala agle janm bhi kinnar hi paidaa legaa
 Kinners do not burn the dead but rather bury it
 khwab or hakeekat ke bichakinnaron kii jindagi rahasyamay hoti he or yahi samaaj ke duusare logon ko unke prati utsuk rakhata he
 a terrible truth of the Kinner world is that this society is looking for boys who are beautiful
 jisaki chaal-dhaal thodi komal ho or jo ooncha uthne ke khwab dekhtaa ho
 This community grows closer to him and then he is castrated as time passes
 badhiya, yani uske sharir ke hisse ke us ang ko kaat dena, jiske baad vah kabhi ladkaa nahin rahata
 In the days of struggle, many producer directors refused to take Amitabh Bachchan into the movies after counting their flaws
 itnaa hi nahin jab vah akashwani main swar pariksha ke liye gaye to vahaan unki aawaaj ko khaarij kar diya gaya, lekin unhone apni in sabhi kathith khaamiyon ko gunon main badalakar yah sabit kar diya ki unhen nakaarne vaale hi galat the

 paarchaa kaa kahana he ki 1970 ke dashak main filmon ke charitron ko behtareen dhang se samajhane main amitabh bachchan se behatar koi doosraa kalakar nahin tha
 The other actors were tied to a particular genre, but Amitabh Bachchan showed all the roles well

 Bollywood megastar and show host Amitabh Bachchan has apologized for this

 co / ynpav4dyfo — Amitabh Bachchan (@srbachchan) November 8, 2019 Sony TV admitted its mistake even before Amitabh Bachchan's apology
 soshal media par bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ke netaa nitesh rane or shri rajput karani sena ke saath milakar kebisi ke ek darshak varg ne kaarykram ke sawaal par virodh jataayaa, jahaan maratha yoddha shaasha ko shivaji ke rup main sanderbhit kiya gaya tha
 As the hash tag boycot started trending on KBC Sony TV social media, the company that produced the show publicly apologized for their mistake
 vivaad sho ke baad shuru hua, jab kaarykram ke host amitabh bachchan ne kebisi ke haalia apisod main sawaal kiya : inamen se koun sa shaasha mughal samraat aurangzeb kaa samakaleen tha? e) maharana pratap, bi) rana sanga, si) maharaja ranjit singh, di) shivaji
 The answer to this answer was D) Shivaji
 lekin prashn kaa uttar dete hue bachchan ne chhatrapati shivaji maharaj ko sirf shivaji kah kar sambodhit kiya
 Soon many viewers objected to this, saying that Sony Channel and Amitabh Bachchan have insulted the great Maratha ruler Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and should apologize for this
 channel ne jataayaa afsos-yah mudda soshal media par lagaataar charchaa kaa vishay bana rahaa or shuukravaar subah tak hesh tag boykot kebisi soni tivi soshal media par trend kar rahaa tha
 In the end, the channel accepted its mistake and apologized
 'koun banegaa karodpati' ke guuruuvaar shaam ke episod main, channel adhikariyon ne ek tikar chalaaya, jisamen likhaa tha : "anjaanepan ke chalate kal (buudhvaar) ke episod ke dauraan chhatrapati shivaji maharaj kaa ek galat sandarbh pesh kiya gaya, jiskaa hamen behad afsos he
 " kashmir maamle par madhyasthata ko lekar america raashtrapati donald trump ke daawey kii pole khul gai he
 Democratic Party MP Brad Sherman said, 'everyone knows Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will never do such a thing
 har koi jo dakshin asia kii videsh niti ke bare main kuch bhi jaanata he, wo ye jaanata he ki kashmir masale main bharat lagaataar tisare paksh kii madhyasthata kaa virodh karata rahaa he
 Everyone knows that PM Modi will never do such a thing
 trump kaa bayaan gair sanjeeda or bhraamak he or sharminda karne vaala bhi
 i have apologized to Indian Ambassador Harsh Shringla for this disgraceful and embarrassing mistake of Trump
 maine donald trump kii shaukia or sharmnaak galati ke liye bhartiya rajdoot harsh ve shringla se maafi maangi he
 'at the same time, after the strong response of India, now the matter has also been cleaned from the US side
 america videsh mantralay ne bayaan jari kar bharat ke us paksh kaa samarthan kiya he jisamen kaha gaya he ki pehle aatankwaad kaa khaatmaa ho uske baad hi baatcheet sambhav he
 Apart from this, the Kashmir dispute has also been described as a bilateral matter
 duusari ore congress saansad shashi tharur ne bhi trump ke bayaan par kadi asahmati jataai he
 He said, 'I really don't think Trump has any idea what he is talking about? Either no one informed them about the matter or they did not understand what Modi was saying or what is India's stand on third party mediation
 videsh mantralay ko is maamle par spashtikaran dena chahie ki bharat ne kabhi bhi aisi kisi madhyasthata ko lekar koi baat nahin kii he
 In a joint press conference with Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan, Trump said on Monday that Modi was with him two weeks ago and offered to mediate on the Kashmir case
 trump ne yah bhi kaha ki mujhe lagata he ki bharat hal chahta he or pakistan bhi
 This issue has been going on for 70 years
 mujhe isamen madhyasthata karne par khushi hogi
 On the other hand, the Congress on Tuesday lashed out at Prime Minister Modi over the claims of US President Donald Trump and questioned whether the Prime Minister should answer whether he had made the offer or whether Trump is lying
 party ke mukhya pravaktaa randeep surajevaala ne twit kar kaha, 'ab white house ne likhit rup se yah puri tarah spasht kar diya he ki pradhanmantri modi ne raashtrapati trump se kashmir par madhyasthata ke liye kaha tha
 He questioned, "when will our Prime Minister wake up and tell Trump nonsense if Trump is lying?" Or the same question whether Prime Minister Modi asked the US President for mediation? vah bharat kii sabase charchit khilaadiyon main se ek hai, lekin tennis star sania mirza kaa khud kaa maananaa he ki 'lingabhed' ke kaaran 'is desh main sania mirza hona mushkil he
 
 
 Sania Mirza, referring to the difficulties faced during her career as a female player, said, "yes, it is difficult to be Sania Mirza in this country
 
 
 meraa maananaa he ki mujhe apane kariyar main adhiktar vivaadon kaa saamana isliye karnaa padaa, kyonki main mahila hum
 
 
 If i were a man, i could have avoided some of these controversies
 
 
 " Indeed, Sania Mirza has been appointed as the UN Women's Goodwill Ambassador for the South Asian region, and is involved in campaigning to end violence against women and girls and to spread awareness about gender equality

 hamaare vartmaan khelmantri sarvanand sonoval mahila khelon ko bahut badhaava dete hai or maine nijee rup se yah dekha he
 Sania said, "I am happy that the government is also talking about gender inequality prevailing in our society and the truth is that it is trying to do something about it, which shows how important it is
" sania mirza ne kaha, hamen saanskrithik badlaav kii jarurat he or ummid he ki media bhi isaki jimmedaari legaa
 The role of media is important
 vah badlaav laa saktaa he or use aisa karnaa chahie
 He said, gender equality should be supported by all of us
 kuch is bare main bolte hai, kuch nahin
 i have been chosen to speak on this
 mujhe ummid he ki ek din sabhi bolenge ki ham sab ek hai or mahilaon ke saath vastu kii tarah vyavhaar nahin kiya jayega
 i will do my best to bring change
 tennis star ne iske saath hi kaha ki vah 6 disambar se shuru hone vaale international premier tennis lig (aitipiel) main khilne ko lekar utsahit hai
 They said, i am leaving tonight
 main yahaan se abhyaas karne jaaoongi or uske baad sidhe hawaii adde jaaoongi
 i am very excited about this
 main aitipiel main khilne ke liye taiyaar hum
 Are we waiting for an All India Radio that when the Prime Minister speaks, he will say something that has not been spoken yet
 aisa kya sunanaa baaki he, jo ham pradhanmantri ke bolne kaa intazaar kar rahe hai
 It is being reminded in every debate and article that oh yes, the Prime Minister is not even speaking
 itnaa to bolte hai, magar is par kyon chup ho gaye hai
 Have they also become silent Modi like Maun Mohan Singh? ve man kii baat main nahin bol rahe hai, jan se baat nahin kar rahe hai
 For the last two weeks, the ministers of his government and spokespersons of the party have been speaking out loud that nothing wrong has happened
 kya pradhanmantri kuch alag kah denge, kya ve kah denge ki haa, galat hua he
 My party spokesperson was lying
 thik he ki chunaavon main bahut bolaa karte the, lekin kisi bhi netaa ke saamne do mukhyamantri or do kendriya mantri ko ek saath hataane kii chunauti ho, use chuppi maar hi jaaegi
 You can undoubtedly compare his compulsion to Manmohan Singh
 isamen khushi milti he to zarur kiijie, lekin ek pradhanmantri kya apane netaaon ke kaale-safed karnaamon ke bare main nahin jaanate honge
 Do they not know from where their mps, mlas bring money
 kya unhen pataa nahin ki virdohi dalon ke netaaon ke paas kahaan se paisa aata he
 This was the reason that Manmohan Singh kept silent, this is why Prime Minister Modi has to keep quiet
 pradhanmantri ko bolne kaa man zarur karata hoga
 Whenever he would go to any meeting, his eyes would avoid him that no one has come in the hope that i have to speak on Vasundhara Raje and Sushma
 jab ve janmdin ke bare main twit karne jate honge to khyaal to aata hi hoga ki koi yah na likh de ki vasundhara maamle par kab bolenge
 It is not so easy for the Prime Minister to keep quiet
 lalit modi ne arun jetali, rajeev shukla, robert wadra or priyanka gandhi ke bhi naam liye hai
 What will they say in terms of their home to others' home
 kahaan tak bolenge
 The Prime Minister too must have wondered whether the days have come, when the Chief Minister was upset with the allegations against him, then everyone used to defend me, today when he has become the Prime Minister, he has to defend them all
 un par lage aaropon ko sahanaa pad rahaa he
 Therefore, i understand the pain of those who speak openly
 unki chuppi unhen bheetar se bahut bulawaati he
 He started a campaign of Selfie with Daughters so that there could be some more talk about him on social media
 aalochakon ne tab to khub saraahaa tha jab gaanv ke sarpanch ne ye abhiyaan chalaaya, lekin jab pradhanmantri ne ise aage badhaayaa to sab aalochana karne lage
 It must be seen that the sarpanch of the village has not resorted to a noble campaign to hide their shortcomings, but it is also not right to question their campaign on the basis of this
 yah sawaal zaruri to he hi ki in abhiyaanon se hakeekat badalegi kya
 If it has not changed anywhere, it has also changed somewhere, but it will definitely require such campaigns
 sunanaa bhi ek tarah se bolnaa hota he
 Many are reminding that Maya Kodnani, who went to jail as Chief Minister in Gujarat on charges of rioting, was not removed until she was sent to jail
 aise daleelon ke sahare aam aadmi party vaale kah rahe hai ki hamane bhi jitendra singh tomars ko tabhi hataaya jab ve jail gaye
 This habit is good in the Prime Minister
 ve kisi ko hataate nahin hai
 Home Minister Rajnath Singh had rightly said that these are ndas, there are no resignations here
 kya ye pradhanmantri kaa bayaan nahin he
 Until he refutes this statement is the prime minister's own
 yah bhi to sochiye ki kahin ve chup rahakar dusron kii bolti band karne kaa koi plan to nahin bana rahe
 i have not seen any defeat of Narendra Modi as a leader in politics from 2000 to 2015
 isliye utsahit jan apni qamar thik se kas len
 His silence has led many to become advisors
 ve lekh likhane lage hai ki pradhanmantri nahin bolkar apana nuksaan kar rahe hai
 Some remedy is suggesting that i wish there would have been a media advisor in the Prime Minister's Office
 is haalat main to acha he ki koi nahin he varna har duusari khabar ye hoti he ki pradhanmantri ke media salaahkaar bhi phone nahin uthaa rahe hai
 His mobile is off for four days
 manmohan singh ne bhi to rakhaa tha, unhone koun-sa tir maar liya
 When there are so many advisors in the media, then what is the need to hire someone and keep an advisor? jo vyakti apane dam par chunaav ladakar apni party or virdohi raajnneeti ko dharaashahee karte hue pradhanmantri ban saktaa he vah bina media salahakar ke bhi kaam chalaa saktaa he
 We are all beginning to see corruption as a 3-hour film
 kahani kaa ant sukhaant ho or asaty par satya kii vijay ho jaae
 Corruption is the follower of today's politics
 use mitaane vaala mit jayega
 Whether it is Congress or BJP, Janata Dal or Samajwadi, all are doing politics of morality with the money of corruption
 ham sab chaahate hai ki film khatm ho or agali kisi film ke liye bhrashtachar haar jaae
 Today someone removed a piece of his speech from Google
 main sunne laga
 The Prime Minister was speaking at the Allahabad meeting
 sunate hue ek baar to mujhe bhi laga ki safai ho jaaegi lekin kya ham nahin jaanate ki mushkil he
 i am writing for you what he said
 unke bhaashan ko shabdash tip kiya he
 The comments " aap mujhe bataaiye raajnneeti main se apradheekaran khatm hona chahie ki nahin hona chahie
 Hooliganism should be done or not
 bam bandook kii raajnneeti samaapt honi chahie ki nahin chahie
 Bless me with mother Ganges soil
 elahabaad ke bhaaiyon bahanon mujhe aashirwad do
 i have come out with fists of death
 main raajnneeti main aparaadh ke khilaaf ladanaa chahta hum
 i want your blessings to end criminalization
 main aapako bataata hum
 After the formation of the new government, the number of parliament members who will come, they have written in the affidavit while filling their nomination, how many cases have been filed, all have been written
 ye sari chizein main supreme court ko de duungaa
 The Supreme Court will fold hands and make such a system that they open the account of all the new people who have come out
 cese chalaao, ek saal ke andar-adar jo gunahagaar hai, unhen jail main daalo, jo begunaah hai, unhen sansad main bhejo
 And those who go to jail, the seat will be vacant, by-elections will come, they are known in Allahabad
 
 
 haa
 
 
 Brothers and sisters no longer a crook, these bombs will not appear in Parliament after a year of gun politics
 ek baar sansad kii safai kar duungaa or phir essembly ko haath main luungaa
 As many as are sitting in the assembly (both of them spread their hands and pinch, the crowd is filled with enthusiasm), i will live with milk and milk
 isamen kisi party or gotra nahin dekhuunga
 i will not see anyone
 agar modi pe mukadmaa hoga, wo bhi chalegaa
 This speech is so brilliant, a strong reply comes in his support from every point
 bheed nai urja se bhar jaati he
 Ram knows how much Parliament was cleaned in a year, but the Prime Minister's wish is being fulfilled
 sabaki pole khul rahi he
 It is not easy to clean corruption and criminals from politics
 bolne kaa matlab he ki kaarywahi karnaa
 If they set out on this path, they would never be able to come back to the seven racecourse
 sabko hataate-hataate yaa to akele bachenge yaa khud bhi hat jaaenge
 You are ready for this
 ye balidaan sirf unhen nahin aapako bhi dena hoga
 " pichley do hafte se unki sarkaar ke mantri or party ke pravaktaa jor-jor se bol hi rahe he ki kuch galat nahin hua he
 Will the Prime Minister say something different, will he say yes, wrong
 meri party ke pravaktaa jhooth bol rahe the
 Well, he used to speak a lot in the elections, but any leader has a challenge to remove two Chief Ministers and two Union Ministers together, it will kill him silently
 aap beshak unki majaburi kii tulana manmohan singh se kar sakate hai
 If you find happiness in this, definitely do, but what a Prime Minister would not know about the black and white exploits of his leaders
 kya unhen pataa nahin ki unke saansad, vidhayak kahaan se paisa laate hai
 Do they not know where the money comes from the leaders of the opposing parties
 yahi kaaran tha ki manmohan singh chup rahete the, yahi kaaran he ki pradhanmantri modi ko chup rahanaa pad rahaa he
 The Prime Minister must have wanted to speak
 ve jab bhi kisi sabha main jate honge unki nigahen unase bachati hongi ki kahin koi is ummid main to nahin aa gaya he ki mujhe vasundhara raaje or sushamaa par bolnaa he
 When they go to tweet about the birthday, the thought comes that no one should write down when Vasundhara will speak on the matter
 pradhanmantri ke liye chup rahanaa itnaa aasaan nahin he
 Lalit Modi has also named Arun Jaitley, Rajiv Shukla, Robert Vadra and Priyanka Gandhi
 wo apane ghar se lekar dusron ke ghar tak ke maamle main kya-kya bolenge
 Where will i speak? pradhanmantri bhi sochate honge ki kya din aa gaye hai, jab mukhyamantri tha to apane upar lage aaropon se pareshaan rahata tha, tab sab meraa bachaav karte the, aaj jab ve pradhanmantri bane hai to unhen un sabakaa bachaav karnaa pad rahaa he
 He has to bear the charges against him
 isliye main khulkar bolne waalon kii takalif samajhataa hum
 Their silence invites them from within
 unhone selfi vid dotrs kaa abhiyaan chalavaaya taaki soshal media par unhen lekar kuch or baaten bhi ho saken
 Critics were highly praised when the sarpanch of the village launched this campaign, but when the Prime Minister took it forward, everyone started criticizing it
 zarur dekhnaa chahie ki gaanv ke sarpanch ne apni kamiyon ko chhipaane ke liye ek nek abhiyaan kaa sahaara to nahin liya, lekin sirf is baat ko aadhaar banaakar unke abhiyaan par sawaal uthaanaa bhi thik nahin he
 This question is important, whether the reality will change with these campaigns
 kahin nahin badali to kahin badali bhi he par isse aise abhiyaanon kii zarurat to rahegi hi
 Listening also means speaking
 kai log yaad dilaa rahe hai ki gujarat main mukhyamantri ke taur par dangon ke aarope main jail gayi maaya kodenani ko tab tak nahin hataaya jab tak unhen jail nahin bheja gaya
 With the help of such arguments, the Aam Aadmi Party members are saying that we too removed Jitendra Singh Tomar only when he went to jail
 pradhanmantri main ye aadat acchhee he
 They do not remove anyone
 grahamantri rajnath singh ne thik kaha tha ki ye en di e hai, yahaan istife nahin hote
 Is this not the statement of the Prime Minister? jab tak ve khandan nahin karte tab tak yah bayaan pradhanmantri kaa hi he
 Also think that if they are not making any plan to keep quiet and stop speaking to others
 2000 se 2015 tak kii raajnneeti main maine netaa ke taur par narendra modi kii koi haar nahin dekhi he
 That's why excited people tighten their waist properly
 unki chuppi se kai logon ko salaahkaar banane kaa mauka mil gaya he
 They have started writing articles that the Prime Minister is doing his loss by not speaking
 koi upaay bataa rahaa he ki kaash pradhanmantri karyaalay main media salaahkaar hota
 It is good in this condition that there is no one or else every other news is that even the Prime Minister's media advisors are not picking up the phone
 unka mobile chaar dinon se band he
 Manmohan Singh had also kept, which arrow he shot
 jab media main itane salaahkaar hai hi to tankhwaah or pad dekar kisi ko salaahkaar rakhane kii zarurat kya he
 a person who can become a Prime Minister by contesting elections on his own and ruining his party and anti-politics, can also work without media advice
 ham sab bhrashtachar ko 3 ghante kii film kii tarah dekhne lage hai
 Let the end of the story be peaceful and the triumph of truth prevail
 bhrashtachar hi aaj kii raajnneeti kaa paalankarta he
 The one who eats it will be erased
 congress ho yaa bhaajapa, janata dal yaa samaajawaadee sab bhrashtachar ke paise se hi naitikta kii raajnneeti kar rahe hai
 We all want the film to end and corruption will be lost for the next film
 aaj kisi ne google se unke bhaashan kaa ek ansh nikaal kar diya
 i started listening
 pradhanmantri elahabaad kii sabha main bol rahe the
 While listening, i also thought that cleanliness will happen, but don't we know that it is difficult
 aapke liye likh rahaa hum ki unhone kya bolaa
 Has typed his speech verbatim
 tippaniyan "you tell me that criminalization should not end in politics
 gundgardee jaani chahie ki nahin chahie
 The politics of bomb guns should or should not end
 maa ganga kii dharti se mujhe aashirwad do
 Brothers and sisters of Allahabad bless me
 main maut ko mutthi main lekar niklaa hum
 i want to fight against crime in politics
 main apradheekaran kaa khaatmaa karne ke liye aapkaa aashirwad chahta hum
 Let me tell you nai sarkaar banane ke baad ye jitne parliament ke member chunakar aaenge, unhone apana namakan bharte samay affidavit main likhaa he kis par kitne cese darj hue hai, sab likhaa hua he
 i will give all these things to the Supreme Court
 supreme court ko haath jodakar kahuunga ki aisi vyavastha karo ki ye jo nae chunakar aae hai, sabakaa khaataa khol do
 Run the case, within a year, put other people who are guilty, in jail, those who are innocent, send them to Parliament
 or jo jail jaaenge wo seat khaali ho jaaegi, upachunaav aayega, elahabaad main maaloom hai na
 
 
 Yes 
 
 bhaaiyon bahanon ab koi badmaash, ye bam bandook kii raajnneeti karne vaale ek saal ke baad sansad main dikhaai nahin denge
 Once i will clear the Parliament and then take the assembly in hand
 vidhansabha main jitne baithe hai ( ve donon haath failaa kar chutki bajaate hai, bheed josh se bhar jaati he),doodh kaa doodh pani kaa pani karke rahoonga bhaaiyon
 i will not see any party and gotra in it
 kisi kaa nahin dekhuunga
 If Modi gets sued, that too will do
 yah bhaashan itnaa shandaar he, unki har baat par peeche se unke samarthan main jaandaar jawaab aata he
 The crowd fills with new energy
 ek saal main sansad kii kitni safai hui ye to ram jane, lekin pradhanmantri kii ek marzi to puri ho hi rahi he
 Everyone's pole is opening
 itnaa aasaan nahin he ki bhrashtachar or aparaadhiyon ko raajnneeti se saaf kar dena
 To speak means to take action
 is raste par ve nikle to kabhi laut kar saat rescorse nahin aa paaenge
 Removing all will either survive alone or will be removed by itself
 aap taiyaar hai, iske liye
 These sacrifices have to be given not only to you but also to them

 We are all beginning to see corruption as a 3-hour film
 kahani kaa ant sukhaant ho or asaty par satya kii vijay ho jaae
 Corruption is the follower of today's politics
 use mitaane vaala mit jayega
 Whether it is Congress or BJP, Janata Dal or Samajwadi, all are doing politics of morality with the money of corruption
 ham sab chaahate hai ki film khatm ho or agali kisi film ke liye bhrashtachar haar jaae
 Today someone removed a piece of his speech from Google
 main sunne laga
 The Prime Minister was speaking at the Allahabad meeting
 sunate hue ek baar to mujhe bhi laga ki safai ho jaaegi lekin kya ham nahin jaanate ki mushkil he
 i am writing for you what he said
 unke bhaashan ko shabdash tip kiya he
 The comments " aap mujhe bataaiye raajnneeti main se apradheekaran khatm hona chahie ki nahin hona chahie
 Hooliganism should be done or not
 bam bandook kii raajnneeti samaapt honi chahie ki nahin chahie
 Bless me with mother Ganges soil

 After the formation of the new government, the number of parliament members who will come, they have written in the affidavit while filling their nomination, how many cases have been filed, all have been written
 ye sari chizein main supreme court ko de duungaa
 The Supreme Court will fold hands and make such a system that they open the account of all the new people who have come out
 cese chalaao, ek saal ke andar-adar jo gunahagaar hai, unhen jail main daalo, jo begunaah hai, unhen sansad main bhejo
 And those who go to jail, the seat will be vacant, by-elections will come, they are known in Allahabad

 This speech is so brilliant, a strong reply comes in his support from every point
 bheed nai urja se bhar jaati he
 Ram knows how much Parliament was cleaned in a year, but the Prime Minister's wish is being fulfilled
 sabaki pole khul rahi he
 It is not easy to clean corruption and criminals from politics
 bolne kaa matlab he ki kaarywahi karnaa
 If they set out on this path, they would never be able to come back to the seven racecourse

 " unki chuppi se kai logon ko salaahkaar banane kaa mauka mil gaya he
 They have started writing articles that the Prime Minister is doing his loss by not speaking
 koi upaay bataa rahaa he ki kaash pradhanmantri karyaalay main media salaahkaar hota
 It is good in this condition that there is no one or else every other news is that even the Prime Minister's media advisors are not picking up the phone
 unka mobile chaar dinon se band he
 Manmohan Singh had also kept, which arrow he shot
 jab media main itane salaahkaar hai hi to tankhwaah or pad dekar kisi ko salaahkaar rakhane kii zarurat kya he
 a person who can become a Prime Minister by contesting elections on his own and ruining his party and anti-politics, can also work without media advice
 ham sab bhrashtachar ko 3 ghante kii film kii tarah dekhne lage hai
 Let the end of the story be peaceful and the triumph of truth prevail
 bhrashtachar hi aaj kii raajnneeti kaa paalankarta he
 The one who eats it will be erased
 congress ho yaa bhaajapa, janata dal yaa samaajawaadee sab bhrashtachar ke paise se hi naitikta kii raajnneeti kar rahe hai
 We all want the film to end and corruption will be lost for the next film

 Hello Uncle, Bouva speaking
 '' dilli main efem sunne vaala lagbhag har shaks is aawaaj se waakif he
 The thin-bodied, soft-spoken, popular radio jockey Raunak has his eyes open even before he opens his lips
 ve apni tukbandi or shararti bachche bauwa kii aawaaj se lakhon logon ko gudgudate hai
 His satire appeals to most people in today's era
 lekin inhen kii vajah se vivaad kaa tufaan bhi khadaa ho jaataa he, or ve apane guide kii naseehat yaad karte hue khamoshi odh lete hai
 The atmosphere of the person enhances his personality, Raunak is no exception
 raunak kii jaden uttar pradesh ke ambedkarnagar jile ke gaanv jahangirganj main hai, jahaan se unke pita jagadish dube sattar ke dashak main mumbai pahunche or godarej company main naukari shuru kii
 "one of his claims to fame is that he was the first in his generation to get married after getting employed!" Says Raunak, laughing
 Raunak, born on December 25, 1984 in Jagdish and Madhuri Dubey's home in Mumbai, has a big Sister Seema and younger brother are Rahul

 Became Announcer or Radio Jockey in Akashwani in 2006, which was a part time job as he got admission in Chetna College for MBA in the same year
 emb ke duusare saal main spinech naamak ritel store main supplai chen manager ban gaye or teen saal tak koi chuttee nahin lee lekin privet efem main entry kii koshish jari rakhi
 Even after giving interviews on Red FM nine times, he did not feel disheartened and finally became successful for the tenth time in 2009
 ve lakhanu chale gaye, jahaan sitambar 2010 tak rahe or phir 4 aktubar, 2010 ko dilli main shaam 5-9 kaa samay diya gaya
 Then, like the youth, he used to talk about fun and raised social issues rarely
 lekin is bich disambar 2011 main shaam vaala sho karte-karte ek prank kol ke dauraan red efem ke studio main hi khyaali bauwa kaa janm hua, jo apane purabia andaaj se logon ko gudgudane laga
 "I didn't realize it initially but slowly it caught pace and people started liking it a lot," says Raunak
 phir usko hamane apane sho kaa mahatvapurn hissaa hi bana diya
 In 2014, he got a morning slot in which he would talk on various issues
 phir 2017 main zee news par 'fan kii baat' shuru kiya, jo rajnatik vyangy tha
 Also did other shows on TV
 2009 main lakhanu main hi unki mulaakaat bhatkhede se bharatnatyam kii vishaarad sonam se hui, donon ke bich pyaar hua
 They both got married in December 2013

 is par rajya kii purv mukhyamantri mahabuuba mufti ne kaha he ki yah puraa ghatnakram niraash karne vaala he
 The Mufti said in a special conversation with Aaj Tak that the governor should have first looked into the possibilities of forming a government
 adarsh sthiti yah hoti ki vah sabase bade dal ko sarkaar banane ke liye aamantrit karte
 He further said that if Sajjad Lone is claiming to have 18 mlas with him, then it means buying and selling
 ham aage kii sambhaavnaaon ko talaashenge
 Such decisions cannot be expected in a democracy
 vahiin, congress ke netaa gulam nabi aaazaad ne is ghatnakram par kaha he ki bijepi nahin chaahati he ki uske alaava koi or sarkaar banaae
 He further said that now elections should be held in the state in three to four months, because we do not want the Governor's rule to remain there
 unhone kaha ki bijepi kaa taanaashaahee ravaiya ek baar phir se sabake saamne aa gaya he
 Azad said that there was not even talk among the parties and a meeting of mlas was called but BJP does not want any government in Jammu and Kashmir
 gulam nabi aaazaad ne is baat ko sweekaara ki 23 november ko vahaan congress ke vidhayakon kii baithak hone vaali thi jisamen ham sarkaar banane kii sambhaavnaaon par vichaar karne vaale the
 Because such things were going on for three to four months that the possibilities of forming a government there should be explored
 lekin pench yahaan funs rahaa tha ki is tarah ke halaat main naa to congress kaa koi netaa mukhyamantri banane ke liye taiyaar tha naa hi neshnal conference se koi mukhyamantri banane ke liye raji ho rahaa tha or naa hi pidipi apana mukhyamantri vahaan chaah rahi thi
 In this, it was not possible to form a government there
 haa ribelle jarur vahaan chaah rahe the ki sarkaar bane
 As soon as the BJP came to know that the possibilities of forming a government were being considered, they quickly imposed President's rule
 idhar, ensi adhyaksh umr abdulla ne ek twit main likhaa, 'jammu-kashmir neshnal conference paanch maheenon se lagaataar vidhansabha bhang karne kii maang kar rahi thi
 It is not a coincidence that Mehbooba Mufti was going to stake claim to form the government and the Governor dissolved the assembly
 'JKNC has been pressing for assembly dissolution for 5 months now
 It can't be a coincidence that within minutes of Mehbooba Mufti Sahiba letter staking claim the order to dissolve the assembly suddenly appears
 — Omar Abdullah (@omarabdullah)november 21, 2018bataa den ki buudhvaar shaam ko mahabuuba mufti ne rajyapal ke samaksh sarkaar banane kaa daawa pesh kiya tha
 The Governor dissolved the assembly shortly thereafter

 Earlier on Wednesday, Mehbooba claimed that she had the support of the Congress and the National Conference
 vahiin, bhartiya janata party ke pradesh adhyaksh rabindra raina ne kaha he ki bijepi rajyapal dwaara uthaae gaye is kadam kaa swaagat karti he

 In the aftermath of victory like Gujarat's defeat and unmatched defeat in the by-elections, there are questions in the government which no party has faced in recent years
 jaahir he, is tarah kii nirantar chunavi vijay bhi to durlabh thim
 For the first time since economic liberalization, the country saw that three parties in the five largest economies ie Club Five (maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and Karnataka) and the emerging three major states (rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh) on that party
 Is ruled by who is also ruling at the center

 After this, three major small economies Jharkhand, Haryana and Assam are also under bjp's control
 yah aisa avasar tha, jiske liye upie sarkaar das saal tak tarasati rahi
 Many important experiments of reforms could not hold ground because the political relations of the Center with large and resource-rich states were not warm
 lekin kya centre va rajyon main rajnatik rishton ke rasayan se modi sarkaar ke mishan paravaan chadh sake? modi sarkaar pichley ek dashak kii pehali aisi sarkaar he jisane 'swatchta' se 'udaan' yani jameen se lekar aasmaan tak kaaryakramon or mishnon kii jhadi laga di, phir bhi sarkaron se naaraazgi ne gher hi liya!kyon nahin ummiido par khari utari modi kii team india?1

 But in the last four years, no new major revolutionary reforms or experiments have been seen in any state
 yojana ayog ko samaapt karne se phayda nahin hua
 Instead of getting independence in the economic decisions of the states, the new scheme got Raj, which was loaded on the old structure

 The financial situation of the states has deteriorated in the last three years

 kitni hasarat se aapane apana nayaa smart phone kharida tha
 Looked at friends' phones, looked at commercials and even danced on the internet
 phone kharidne gayi, to jitna sochaa tha usase kahin zyada kharch kar daalaa
 Now the phone runs cool, but what to do with this combined battery! They leave the house in full charge, but the battery starts sinking before the sun sets
 dar laga rahata he ki kahin bich main hi phone band na ho jaae
 If people who use smart phones are asked what they hate most about their phones, then most people will answer - battery
 phone kii technology pichley kuch saalon main kahaan se kahaan pahunch gayi
 But sadly, there was no radical change in the case of battery
 rahi sahi kasar puri kar di companiyon ke bich is baat kii hode ne ki koun kitna slim phone bana saktaa he
 The slim phone looks beautiful but it also means that there will be less room for battery in the phone
 ab dubli-patali si betry bhala rocket kii raftaar vaale smart phone ko kitni der chalaa paaegi
 The result is that you are seen moving around with the charger all the time
 ham aapaki is mushkil ko aasaan banane ke kuch upaay bataate hai
 Do not expect that these measures will start running the battery of your smart phone as much as your old basic phone
 aakhir ye kaise sambhav he ki aap chalaaen to SUV lekin ummid karen maruti 800 ke milage kii! lekin in upayon se itnaa jarur hoga ki ghar lautne se pehle hi phone band ho jane kaa khatra kam ho jayega
 The measures that we are telling, they are written according to Android phones
 lekin zyaadaatar baaten har phone par lagu hoti hai– settings or steps kuch alag ho sakate hai
 Here are 20 tips to make the battery run longer
 shuruaati tips un logon ke liye hai jinaki naye phone se abhi nayi dosti he
 Further tips are for old and experienced users
 1
 Reduce the brightness of the phone's screen - in a smart phone with any touch screen, the screen spends more than half the battery alone
 screen jitani badi, chamakdaar or hai rijolution vaali hogi use power bhi utani hi zyada chahie
 If your phone has auto mode for screen brightness then use it
 nahin to britaness ko 50 percent ke aasapaas rakhen
 This will reduce the emphasis on your eyes and the battery will also cost less
 khaas jarurat ke samay– jaise tej dhoop main photo yaa video dekhte samay aap kuch der ke liye britaness badha sakate hai
 2
 jeepies, blue tooth, vaai-faai ko of rakhen–jeepies (global pojishning system) kaa istemaal to aap vaise bhi kabhi-kabhaar hi karenge
 But even if you keep it running, the battery will continue to be spent fast
 isi tarah vaai-faai tabhi on karen jab istemaal karnaa ho
 If wi-fi is still going outside the range, then the phone will continue to search for wi-fi signals and the battery will keep going

 Avoid the vibration of the phone - the phone has to take a lot of strength to vibrate compared to the sound of the ringtone
 isliye bahut jaruri ho (jaise bujurg logon ko yaa jab aap meeting main hon) tabhi wibrasion mod kaa istemaal kare varna ise Disable kar ke rakhen
 In the same way, it is good to keep the 'shake' means that the phone activates and keeps the features closed
 (settings>> Sound and Display>> Phone Vibrate)4
 Leave the fascination of the live wallpaper - the floating wallpaper on the phone screen, the vibrantly moving leaves such as live wallpapers look beautiful
 lekin ye samaj len ki ye betry ke bade dushman hai
 Instead it would be nice to make a dark color photo wallpaper
 5
 Reduce Screen Time Out - Screen timeout means that after doing nothing, the screen light will automatically turn off
 screen timeout jitna kam hoga, betry utani lambii chelegi
 (settings >> Sound & Display >> Screen timeout) 6
 camera, video sanbhal kar –jab phone kii betry kam ho tab camera or video kaa istemaal sanbhal kar karen
 These two things require a lot of power
 jab phone zyada garm mahasoos hone lage to samaj jaaen ki betry teji se kharch ho rahi he or use aaraam kii jarurat he
 7
 aplications thik se band karen -naye yugers sabase zyada yahi galati karte hai
 Applications do not close by pressing the home button, only go into the backgroud
 najaron se ojhal hokar wo betry bhi pite hai or phone kii mamari bhi
 To close applications, press the back button until you exit the app
 yaa phir Exit batan kaa istemaal karen
 8
 phaltu ke App downlod nahin karen -lakhon App muft downlod karne ke liye uplabdh hai iskaa matlab ye nahin kii aap apane phone ko Apps kaa kachraghar bana den
 Remove the apps that you do not use and which have filled your mind from the phone
 9
 Find battery usage - by going to the settings of the phone (settings >> About Phone >> Battery Use), see which application is spending how much battery
 agar koi bina kaam kii aplicoshan zyada betry kha rahi he to use yaa to phone se hataa den)
 If there is a place where the mobile signal is not coming - like an airplane - then turn off the phone or do it in Flight Mode
 nahin to phone lagaataar signal khojataa rahegaa
 10
 2G -3G mod check karen –kahin aisa to nahin ki aapane mobile company se 3G plan liya bhi nahin he or aapkaa phone GSM / WCDMA (auto Mode) par chal rahaa he
 To check which mode the phone is running, go to (settings >> More Settings >> Mobile Networks >> Network Mode >> GSM Only) and if you are not using 3G then bring it to 2G ie GSM Only mode
 aisi jagah par jaaen jahaan 3G sarvice nahin ho to yaad karke isi tarah GSM Only mod par chale jaaen varanaa phone 3G signal khojane main betry phoonkata rahegaa
 11
 vijets se chhutkaaraa paaen–vijets saamaanya se bade sies ke wo iken hai jo aapke phone kii screen par zyada jagah gherte he
 Like weather forecasters, or Facebook and Twitter widgets
 khud-ba-khud apadet hon vaale apadet vijets na sirf betry udaate hai balki lagaataar internet kaa bill bhi badhaate hai
 Do not crowd apps icons on the phone's home screen
 jin Apps ko kabhi kabhaar istemaal karte hai unhen home screen par nahin rakhen balki Menu ke bheetar jaakar kholen
 12
 phone ke inbilt power sever istemaal karen–agar aapke phone main pehle se power seaving mod diya hua he to use on karke rakhen
 This reduces the screen brightness when there is less battery and tries to save the battery by shutting down some less important applications
 lekin play store se betry seaving Apps downlod karnaa koi acha idia nahin hai
 Battery saving apps are the subject of much controversy and many experts believe that the amount of battery that these apps save is spent in running the app itself
 13
 To keep Location Services off - To do this, go to (settings >> Locations Services) and remove the tick mark from all the boxes
 lokation services he to kaam kii cheez lekar lagaataar on rahane par ye aapke phone kii lokshan ko trek karne ke chakkar main betry kharch karti rahati he
 In particular, GPS blows a lot of battery
 jarurat hone par aap lokation sarvice ko kuch der ke liye on kar sakate hai
 14
 Apps ko auto apadet mat hone den –android phone ke tamaam ap aae din apadet hote rahete hai
 Time-free app updates will be huge for both your battery and data charges
 auto apadet of karne ke liye ( Menu>> Play Store>> settings>>auto –update apps) main jaaen or ise Do not auto update par set karen
 Make sure to update your apps manually at least once a week by going to (menu >> Play Store >> My Apps)
 15
 Reduce Sync Interval of Apps - Have ever noticed how many services are running continuously in your phone - that is, Sync keeps happening
 fasebuk, twitor, jimail, offis mail, google plus
 
 
 They also take batteries and data
 agar aap inhen band nahin kar sakate to in Apps kii settings main jaakar Sync Interval kam kar len
 If possible, instead of App download for Facebook and all such things, make bookmarks in the browser and use it
 16
 Uninstall or Disable Extra Apps - Uninstalling downloaded unnecessary apps is easy
 lekin unka bekaar ke Apps kaa kya karen jo phone main pehle se maujuud the lekin aap kabhi istemaal nahin karte
 Android 4
 0 or upar ke varjan main ap ko Disable karne si suvidha he
 Go to (settings >> Application Manager >> All)
 jin Apps ko aap kabhi istemaal nahin karte use kholen or Disable karne kaa batan dabaaen
 If the option to disable is not visible, then first uninstall all its updates
 iske baad phir se Disable karne kii koshish karen
 Keep in mind, do not disable the services you are unable to understand, otherwise there may be something wrong with the phone
 17
 Update Firmware - Check whether your phone has the latest Firmware available for it
 agar nahin he to ise apadet karen 
 Some phones update the OTA (over the Air) firmware
 lekin kai phones main Firmware Update karne ke liye aapako ise Computer se jodna hoga yaa phir sarvice centre kii madad len
 If the battery is going fast after firmware update, then you have to format your external memory card i
e
 SD card
 kaam jaraa mushkil he lekin Firmware Update aapke phone ko naye jaisaa tej bana detaa he or kai nayi suvidhaayen bhi laata he
 18
 AMOLED screen he to blike kaa istemaal karen –agar aapke phone kaa screen AMOLED he to yaad rahe, Black color aapkaa pasandida rang hona chahie
 From the wall to the background color of the browser, the longer you use black, the longer the battery will run
 19
 Do not use two antivirus - some people think that two antivirus will make their phone more secure
 lekin aisa nahin he – ye aapke phone ko sust bana degaa or betry bhi jaati rahegi
 20
 Animation of karen –agar betry aapke liye sabase jaruri cheez he to tamaam aplikations main anemation of kar den
 The style will go down but the battery life will go up
 (settings>> Developer Options>> Drawing) main jaakar tamaam anemation yaa to of kar den yaa Animation Scale kam kar den
 Due to low battery, if the phone is going to be shut down completely and it is not possible to charge, then turn off Mobile Data
 phone to chalata rahegaa, bas internet se judi services kaam nahin karengi
 Nawazuddin Siddiqui, who grabbed everyone's attention with his acting in Gangs of Wasseypur, has some anger these days
 isaki vajah or koi nahimbipasha basubataai ja rahi hai
 This resentment is not personal but professional, which Nawazuddin has mentioned in the Dabi tongue
 navazuddin ko is baat kaa bhi ranj he ki jab se unki jodi suparn verma nirdeshit film aatma menhot bipasha basuke saath aane kii khabar media main ai he tab se achaanak unke tital role par baariki se gaur kiya ja rahaa he
 Nawazuddin says that it is really strange that my title role in the soul is so discussed
 isse pehle mangangs of vasepuramein bhi tital role play kar chukaa hum
 Nobody is discussing that
 main pehle jaisaa tha aaj bhi vaisaa hi hum
 People may see changes in me, but i do not see any change in myself
 aapaki baat main dam to he navaj lekin auron kii tarah aap chaahakar bhi bipasha ke jaadu se batch nahin sakate
 Steel company Tata Steel sold its 25-acre land at Borivali in Mumbai to Oberoi Realty for Rs 1,155 crore through auction
 company ne ek bayaan jari kar kaha, bikri prakriya ke sanchaalan ke liye gathit swatantra nideshkon kii samiti ne ghoshnaa kii ki oberoi realti limited ne nilaamee main sabase oonchi 1,155 karod rupee kii boli lagaai
 Tata Steel started the bid-cum-auction process for the sale of this land on 18 December last year
 ratan tata kii mahatvakankshilkhatikaya car nainoko ab company iske nae avatar 'janeex naino' ke taur par bazaar main utaarne kii taiyaari main he
 With this, the tag of the cheapest car will also be removed from this Tata Motors car
 pehali baar ke car kharidaaron ko aakarshith karne or sabase sasti car kaa tamgaa hataane ke iraade se company nae model main kai nai khubiyaan jodne ja rahi hai
 The Nano was introduced in the year 2009 as the cheapest car
 tab duniya bhar kaa dhyaan isaki ore aakarshith hua tha
 Among other features, the genx Nano will include automatic manual transmission, an open boot and Bluetooth phone sync audio system and other features
 janeex naino ko agle chah-saat saptaah main bazaar main utaara jayega
 After this, the current version of Nano will be gradually removed
 haalanki, iske sirf sienji sanskaran ko kaayam rakhaa jayega
 Girish Wagh, senior vice president of Tata Motors, dismissed speculation that the brand would be scrapped
 unhone kaha ki naino company kaa atyant mahatvapurn product he
 input language raksha mantri manohar parrikar ne kaha ki agar desh par fathankot jaise aatanki hamalaa hota he to ise ladaai kii tarah hi mana janaa chahie
 At the same time, Home Minister Rajnath Singh said that the government is not yet in a position to say with certainty what path the terrorists had come
 donon mantriyon ne kaha ki vahaan par suraksha balon main saamanjasy or talmail main koi kami nahin thi
 The sending of the NSG was also justified because if the terrorists had taken three families living on the base as hostages, then the NSG has the expertise in handling such cases
 donon ne kaha ki ye oparation keval 43 ghanta chalaa naa ki teen yaa chaar din
 The two Union Ministers said this during the discussion in the Lok Sabha
 tippaniyan Under Rule 193, these ministers gave their views during the situation arising out of the terrorist attack on Pathankot airbase in Lok Sabha
 haalanki inke jawaab se vipaksh santusht nahin hua
 Especially Congress leader Jyotiraditya Scindia said that after two and a half months after the terror attack, the government does not know from which way the terrorists came, then how can we be satisfied with their reply
 vipaksh ne isi bahaane rashtriya suraksha salahakaar par nishaanaa saadhaa or kaha ki pehle se jab aatankiyon ke input mil gaya tha to phir kaise aatanki base main daakhil ho gaye
 Significantly, on January 1, the terrorists attacked the Indian Air Force base in Pathankot and killed 7 security forces personnel
 javaabi hamale main sabhi chah aatanki maare gaye
 The two ministers said that there was no lack of cohesion and coordination among the security forces there
 enesji ke bheje jane ko bhi sahi tehraaya kyonki agar aatanki vahaan base par rah rahe teen pariwaron ko bandhak bana lete to enesji ko aise maamalon se nipatane main maharath hasil he
 Both said that this operation lasted only 43 hours and not three or four days
 donon kendriya mantriyon ne ye baat loksabhaa main charchaa ke dauraan kahi
 The comments niyam 193 ke tahat loksabhaa main pathankot airbase par hue aatanki hamale se upje halaat ke dauraan in mantriyon ne apni baat rakhi
 However, the opposition was not satisfied with his reply
 khaskar congress ke netaa jyotiraditya sindhiya ne kaha ki aatanki hamale ke dhai maheene baad jab sarkaar ko ye nahin pataa ki aatanki kis raste se aaye the to phir ham unke jabaab se kaise santusht ho sakate hai
 The Opposition targeted the national security advisory on the pretext and said that when the input of terrorists was already received, then how did the terrorists enter the base
 gauratlab he ki ek janvari ko aatankiyon ne pathankot main bhartiya vayusena ke base par hamalaa kar suraksha balon ke 7 javaanon ko shahid kar diya tha
 All six terrorists were killed in retaliatory attacks

 Underlining the Congress government's peace and development agenda in Assam, the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) and party president Sonia Gandhi on Saturday appealed to militant organizations in Guwahati to join the central government's peace initiative
 sonia ugravadi sanghathan ulpha (united libration front of assam) ke paresh barua ke netritv vaale shanti vaarta virdohi gut ke band ke elaan ke baavjood yahaan pahunchin
 The bandh was announced to protest against his visit
 isi gut ne shuukravaar raat tinsukiya jile main ek bam visphot kiya tha, jisamen ek vyakti kii maut ho gai thi
 Sonia addressed the public meeting at the Sarsuzai Stadium here amidst tight security arrangements
 rajya main sarkaar kii pehali varshganth par samaaroh kaa aayojan isi stadium main kiya gaya
 Congress has come to power for the third time in a row
 sonia ne kaha, 'main aaj yahaan aakar behad khush hum
 This is a very happy occasion as the government constituted for the third consecutive time under the leadership of the Congress has completed one year
 'unhone kaha ki yah is baat kaa sanket he ki sarkaar kii nitiyaan rajya ke logon kaa vishwaas jeetne main sakasham rahi hai
 The trust of the people has increased the responsibilities of the government
 sonia ne kaha, 'zyaadaatar ugravadi sanghathan yah maan chuke hai ki hinsa se unki samasyaon kaa hal nikalne vaala nahin he
 i hope that those who have stayed away from the peace agreement will join the Central Government's peace initiative very soon
 'unhone kaha, 'aap sabhi ko pataa hi he ki 2001 main jab mukhyamantri tarun gogoi ke netritv main congress kii sarkaar bani thi, us samay rajya kii sthiti atyant shochaneey thi
 Government employees were not getting salary
 sadaken nahin thim, koi gramin vikaas kaarykram or udyog nahin tha
 Due to law and order problem, businessmen started leaving the state
 aaj main yahaan kii badali hui tasviir dekhakar bahut khush hum
 The Congress president said, 'about 27 years ago, former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi signed the historic Assam Accord for the development of the state
 maujuuda sarkaar rajya ko vikaas kii ore le jane ke liye lagaataar assam samjhaute ke nirdesh ke mutabik kaary kar rahi he
 He said, "it is the result of the continuous efforts of the present government that the state has been able to achieve many achievements in terms of development
" assam ne khadyannon kaa ricard utpaadan kar desh main itihaas rachaa he
 The tea industry has received a life lease during the last 11 years of Congress rule in Assam
 assam aisa pehla rajya he jahaan ucch vidyalayon ke chaatro ko muft commuter die gaye hai
 Sonia said, "the people of the state have given all possible support to the government and the Congress government will never let people down in the process of making Assam one of the developed and peaceful states of the country
" ' The Central Government claimed in the Supreme Court that the 'radia tapes' aired in the media were manipulated and no government agency was responsible for the leaking of tapes of these recorded telephone conversations
 tippaniyan In a sealed confidential report filed before a bench headed by Justice GS Singhvi, hearing the petition of industrialist Ratan Tata, the government has made these claims regarding the excerpts of the taped telephone conversations
 report main kaha gaya he ki us samay companiyon ke liye lobing kaa kaam karne vaali nira radia kii telephone baatcheet tap (bich main record) karne main doorsanchaar seva pradaata companiyon samet aath se das agenciyaan shaamil thim
 The bench hearing the case looked at some of the opening pages of the government's report, stating that the additions to the tapes of the talks circulated in the media have been subtracted
 report kaa hawala dete hue nyaayamurti singhvi ne kaha ki baatcheet ke shuruaati or antim ansh mul tepe se mail nahin khate hai
 He said that the report also claimed that government officials who were involved in the investigation of the case do not know who leaked these tapes
 khandpeeth ne kaha, ‘‘yah sambhav he ki aisa kisi or ne kiya ho
 '' udyogpati ratan tata kii yachika par sunwaayee kar rahi nyaayamuti ji es singhvi kii adhyakshata vaali khandpeeth ke samaksh daakhil moharband gopneey report main sarkaar ne tap kii gai telephone vaartaon ke prasaarit anshon ke bare main ye daawey kiye he
 The report said that eight to ten agencies, including telecom service provider companies, were involved in taping telephone conversations of Neera Radia, who was lobbying for companies at the time
 maamle kii sunwaayee kar rahi khandpeeth ne sarkaar kii is rapat ke kuch shuruaati prishthon ko dekha he, jisamen kaha gaya he ki media main prasaarit vaarta ke tepon main jod ghataav kiye gaye hai

 It was found in the upper deck of the Boeing 747-400 business class
 yah vimaan mumbai-hyderabad-jedda maarg par udaan sankhya eai 965 se parichaalit ho rahaa tha
 He said that the security personnel took the plane to shore at the airport and security personnel investigated it and later gave operational clearance

 Measures should be taken to improve it
 aadhikarik sutron ne bataaya ki jedda main vimaan ke utarane se thik pehle unhone bataaya ki plastic main lipta ek baksaa bijness class kii ek seat ke neeche padaa mila
 The crew members noticed it and immediately informed the pilot who conveyed it to Jeddah aircraft traffic control
 sutron ne bataaya ki hawaondde par vimaan ke utarane par payalton se use ek kinare le jane ko kaha gaya jahaan surakshakarmiyon ne grenade ko nikaala or paaya ki isamen koi visphotak nahin he
 The aircraft was later allowed further operations
 grenade par 'anti royat ston grenade' jaise chihn hai or ise biguef ke tekanpur aadhaarit tear smoke unit main taiyaar kiya gaya he
 Authorities suspect that it may have remained after the security exercises held earlier last month
 sutron ne bataaya ki udaan bharne se pehle kisi vimaan ko vibhinn charnon kii jaanch or saaf safai ke daur se guzarana hota he jisamen vibhinn shrenee ke karmchaaree shaamil hote hai
 They are also responsible for not seeing such an object in the aircraft

 Terrorist attacks on security forces in Jammu and Kashmir are not taking the name of stopping
 shuukravaar ko aatankiyon ne kashmir ghati main ek baar phir se grenade hamalaa kar diya
 This is the third terrorist grenade attack in the Kashmir Valley in the last 24 hours
 shuukravaar ko aatankiyon ne srinagar ke ghantaghar laal chowk ke paas or shopiyaan main suraksha balon ko nishaanaa banaaya
 Earlier on Thursday, terrorists also carried out a grenade attack in Srinagar, injuring 6 people including an Assistant Sub Inspector (ASI) Iqbal Singh and 2 traffic police personnel
 ASI ikbaal singh jammu and kashmir armd police kii 14 batalian main tainaat hai
 Both of his legs suffered injuries in Thursday's grenade attack
 is hamale trephic pulicekarmi harish manjuur ke gardan ke peeche hisse or sanoullah ke daahine pair main chot ai
 On Friday, the terrorists launched the first attack targeting security forces near Lal Chowk in Srinagar, while the second attack was conducted at a police camp in Shopian in South Kashmir
 in grenade hamale main suraksha balon ke vaahan or aasapaas kii dukaane kshatigrast ho gaye
 However, no casualties have been reported in these latest attacks
 Two incidents of # grenadeattack by # terrorists; one in # Srinagar& other in # Shopian
 # Policeis at the spot
 Investigation in both incidents is going on
 No loss of life or property reported
 @jmukmrpolice— Kashmir Zone Police (@kashmirpolice)january 18, 2019is grenade hamale ke baad suraksha balon ne ilaake ko gher liya he or sandigdh aatankiyon kii talash shuru kar di he
 Currently these terror attacks are being investigated
 vahiin, abhi tak yah spasht nahin ho paaya he ki in teenon hamalon ke peeche kis aatanki sanghathan kaa haath he
 However, on Wednesday, intelligence agencies issued a high alert for jaish-e-mohammed terrorist to carry out suicide attacks
 guuruuvaar ko jo hamalaa hua tha, wo ghantaghar laal chowk se ek kimi kii duuri par he
 In the last 24 hours, 3 grenade attacks have come to the fore in the Kashmir Valley, when the Intelligence Department has issued a high alert about terrorist attacks
 buudhvaar ko khufia agenciyon ne kashmir main aatanki hamalon ko lekar surakshakarmiyon ko hai alert par rahane ko kaha tha
 The security forces were also told that they should remain fully alert in all areas of Kashmir Valley
 khufia agenciyon ne apni report main kaha tha ki jaish-e-mohammad ke fidaayin aatanki suraksha balon ke thikaanon par hamalaa kar sakate hai
 These terrorists are armed with ieds and other explosives
 jaish ke fidaayin aatanki suraksha balon kii chaukiyon par firing bhi kar sakate hai
 Following this intelligence alert, about 500 additional companies of Central Armed Police Forces have also been deployed to thwart the plans of the militants in Kashmir
 isse pehle sena diwas par senadhyaksh general bipin ravat ne bataaya tha ki kashmir ghati main sainya oparation main aatankiyon ko kaaphi nuksaan pahunchaaya gaya he
 He had clearly said that no compromise would be made with the security of the country

 Indian cricket team will face arch-rivals Pakistan on Sunday in their second match of Group-2 of the Twenty20 World Cup
 australia ke khilaaf apane pehle super-8 match main sharmnaak shikast jhelane vaali bhartiya team khitaab ko daud main bane rahane ke liye har haal main yah match jeetna hoga
 The situation in Pakistan is much better than India
 'karo yaa maro' match ke liye taiyaar bharatvah super-8 main apana pehla match jeet chukaa he or philhal talika main australia ke baad duusare sthaan par he
 The South African team, which lost to Pakistan, is in third place on the basis of better run rate while India with the worst run rate is in fourth place
 pakistan kaa palada is samay baari dikh rahaa he kyonki usne vishwa cap ke abhyaas match main bharat ko karaari shikast di thi
 In terms of composition, the Pakistani team seems to be in a better position at the moment
 'najafagarh ke nawab' kaa safarnamousake paas achche gendbaaj or stareey ballebaaj hai jabaki bharat ke paas beshak achche ballebaaj or kai stareey spinner hai lekin ve england ko chhodkar kisi anya mukaable main apni pratibha ke saath nyaay nahin kar sake hai
 The embarrassing defeat against Australia has forced the Indian strategists to brainstorm on their decisions, but the biggest problem of the Indian team remains the team combination even today
 tii-20 world kapah australia ne bharat ko 9 wicket se rondapakistani cricket bhale hi andruni raajnneeti kaa shikaar rahaa he lekin kabhi bhi kisi ne pakistani team ko halke main lene kii galati nahin kii he
 Obviously, India will not make such a mistake and not in such a situation when it has lost in the practice match
 pakistan ke paas beshak bharat jitne sakasham ballebaaj nahin hon lekin uske ballebaajon main bharat kii kamjor akraman pankti ko nestnabut karne kii puri kshamta he or phir umr gul or sohail tanwir jaise visheshgy twanti-20 gendbaaj is team kii akraman pankti ko sabase sakasham banaate hai
 In such a situation, India will have to raise the level of its game because if there is a mistake this time, then Dhoni's team's dream of repeating the success of 2007 will be broken
 pakistan ko haraane ke liye bharat ko har lihaaj se santulit khel dikhaanaa hoga lekin usase pehle captain ko santulit team chunani hogi, jo jaruraton par khari utar sake
 It seems that the magic of Tigmanshu Dhulia has weakened
 sahab bivi gangster siries main do jabardast film or bullate raja jaisi revange drama ke liye mahashur tigmanshu dhulia is baar milan tokies lekar aae hai
 Tigmanshu's previous film was Sahab Biwi Gangster 3 flop
 aaie jaanate hai tigmanshu kii milan tokies kis tarah kii film he
 a boy named Kahanayanu (ali Fazal) dreams of becoming a big film director
 par uski jaati jindagi main tamaam tarah ke sangharsh hai
 He is making a living by making small films
 isi ke saath vah kuch doston ke saath ek racket bhi chalaa rahaa he
 This racket does the work of cheating in the exam
 janardan (ashutosh rana) ko apni beti matholi (shraddha shrinath) ko bie kii pariksha main paas karwaanaa he
 Janardhana seeks Anu's help for this
 yaheen se anu matholi ke sampark main aata he or donon kii prem kahani paravaan chadhati he
 But Maithili's father Janardhan did not approve of this relationship
 darasal, vah apni beti kii shaadi kisi duusare ladke ke saath karwaanaa chahta he
 The twist in the story starts from here and it is a test of love
 kya anu matholi kaa pyaar hasil kar paata he, kya donon alag ho jate hai, kaise janardan anu ko roktaa he? anu janardan kaa saamana kaise karata he in tamaam chizon ko jaanane ke liye tigmanshu dhulia kii film dekhne janaa hoga
 It is obvious that there is nothing new in the story of Milan Talkies
 aisi kahaniyon ke plat pehle bhi kai martabaa hamaare saamne aa chuke hai
 There is also no new treatment in it
 upar se film kii kahani main kai jagah speed braker hai
 Because of this they move at a weak speed
 ant tak aate-aate tamaam chijen ubaau lagane lagati hai
 However, there is some interest in the story in the first half of the film
 lekin duusare half main puri film patari se utari najar aati he
 It can be said that the story of Milan Talkies has fallen victim to scattering
 actinb agar kisi film kii neenv yani kahani hi kamjor ho to achche kalakaar bhi isamen kya kar sakate hai
 Milan Talkies has a great star cast
 kahani main dam nahin hone kii vajah se koi bhi kalakaar apane kirdaar ke saath nyaay nahin kar paaya he
 Ali Fazal's work as Anu will be called average
 unhone apni taraf koshish kii he, lekin wo tamaam tarah ke bikharaav kii vajah se audiyans ke saath conect nahin kar paata
 Shraddha Srinath, who is making her debut on the big screen, has definitely impressed to some extent
 film main unhone dance bhi kiya, intens seens bhi die or drama bhi kaaphi kiya he
 The problem is that there is no depth in his character
 tehraav kii bhi kami lagati he
 Their chemistry is screened with Ali on screen, but due to the story they both have nothing to keep the audience tied up
 ashutosh rana kii kaabiliyat ko dekhte hue lagata he milan tokies unke liye nahin thi
 His character did not seem credible at all
 vaise agar ye film agar 20 saal pehle ai hoti to shaayad uski kahani or kirdaaron main logon ko bharosa hota
 Sanjay Mishra also has a small role in the film
 lekin wo bhi kuch khaas najar nahin aate
 There is also a villain in this romantic story
 sikandar kher ne yah kirdaar nibhaayaa he
 But they have appeared ineffective on the screen
 vaise is film main agar kisi ko dekhakar chehre par muskaan aati he to wo hai tigmanshu dhulia
 Tigmanshu has also acted in the film
 unhone anu ke pita kaa kirdaar nibhaayaa he
 His comic timing and punches are accurate
 film main baaki kalakaaron kaa kirdaar zyada develop nahin he
 Directiontigmanshu Dhulia has tried to make a pure desi romantic film with Milan Talkies
 lekin ise dekhakar kaha ja saktaa he wo isamen buree tarah fail hue hai
 This film cannot be digested by today's audiences
 tigmanshu ne is baat par to jor diya ki anu, matholi se pyaar karata he
 But throughout the film, it is not told why Maithli's father does not accept their relationship
 ye pahalu aakhir tak khatkata he
 The length of the film is also beyond comprehension
 clymex bhi niraashajanak he or tamaam chijen pehle se hi pataa chal jaati hai
 The songs of Musicmillan Talkies are also not worth remembering
 puri film main bas sonu nigam kaa 'shart' gaanaa hi thoda sukun detaa he
 The background score is also very average and does not make any scene more effective
 romantic filmein dekhne kaa shauk he to milan tokies dekhne se parhez karen
 Tigmanshu cannot hope at the box office through this film
 odisha main pul girane se bada haadasa saamne aayaa he
 Two people have died due to the collapse of an under-construction bridge in the capital Bhubaneswar
 jabaki 10 log ghayal ho gaye hai
 It is being told that 5 people are still buried under the rubble
 ye haadasa rajdhani ke bomikhaal ilaake main hua
 Where a part of the bridge under construction fell, people present there came under his control
 is dauraan malbe main dabane se 2 logon kii maut ho gai, jabaki 10 log ghayal ho gaye
 Five people are still trapped in the rubble
 raahat bachaav team maukey par pahunch gai he or fanse logon ko bachaane kii koshish kii ja rahi he

 HIV is considered the most dangerous of sexual diseases
 sambhavat: aisa isliye he, kyonki ise puri tarah thik karne kii dawa ab tak viksit nahin kii ja saki he
 According to a recent report by the World Health Organization, HIV infection is the leading cause of deaths worldwide
 lekin aapako yah jaanakar hairaani hogi ki echivi or aids main antar he
 Being HIV positive does not mean that the person has AIDS
 isliye iske bare main sahi jaankaree behad jaruri he
 Do not suffer from joint pain, do it in winter, this remedy is different from AIDS HIV In fact, infection of HIV (human Immunodefeciency Virus) makes our immunity weak
 immune system ke ek baar kamjor hote hi, duusari sankramak bimariyon kaa khatra bhi bad jaataa he
 Because the body loses its power to prevent infection
 jabaki isse itar aids HIV kaa aglaa charan mana jaataa he
 You can understand this in the way that a cough with a mucus that lasts for a month takes the form of a TV
 jaahir taur par ham khaansee or tibi ko ek tarah nahin dekh sakate hai
 Obesity not only protects against kidney disease
 Green vaccine is also HIV
 Unprotected sex with HIV infected person
 Transmission of infected blood using infected needles can lead to infection of a pregnant woman with her child
 According to a recent report by WHO, there are currently 35 victims worldwide
 3 million yani kareeb saadhe teen karod log echivi se sankramit hai
 Of these, about 21 lakh people are between 10 and 19 years old
 
 
 
 So, if women live more than men, infections in children can be checked and treated at the right time, then children from infected pregnant mothers can be protected from this disease
 ek aankade ke anusaar saal 2012 main echivi se sankramit 62 fisadi garbhvatee mahilaon ke bacchon ko isi tarah sankraman se bachaaya gaya tha
 For the first time in Asia: AIIMS introduced the risk of virtual autopsytb because the body's immunity is weakened due to HIV infection, so the risk of TB increases significantly
 saal 2012 main echivi sankramit kareeb teen lakh 32 hajaar rogiyon kii maut tibi se hui
 Street food is the choice! These deadly diseases may be a way to avoid it
 Regularly check for sexually transmitted diseases
 Make safe sex

 intelegence beuro ne apana itihaas chhapane kaa kaam sthagit kar diya he
 That is, at the moment you will not know the official version of the real story of famous IB operations

" jaise aazaadee ke baad netajisubhash chandra bose ke parivaar kii gatividhiyonper najar kyon rakhi gai
 Therefore, a final decision cannot be taken on this till now
 'ibi is bare main bhi sachet he ki uske aadhikarik itihaas main kisi purv netaa kaa zikr unke vaarison ko naaraaz kar saktaa he or isse 'visphotak' vivaad bhi khadaa ho saktaa he
 But not having a written history of IB or RAW will mean that information and claims about this will come from the former authorities, which can be wrong and can also be exaggerated

 In which it was said that Janardhan Singh Sigriwal hid a criminal case in his election affidavit
 is aadhaar par unki loksabhaa kii sadsyta radd kii jaae
 Janardhan Singh Sigriwal reached the Lok Sabha in 2014 defeating former MP Prabhunath Singh
 unhone apane namakan ke dauraan die gaye afidavit main apane khilaaf chaar aparaadhik maamalon kaa zikr to kiya tha
 But forgot to mention a criminal case of 1986
 jin chaar aparaadhik maamalon kaa zikr he, usamen sabhi rajnatik dhakina pradarshan se jude hue the
 But even before this, Sigrawal had contested four assembly elections, in which he did not mention the cases of 1986 in his affidavit
 prabhunath singh ne bhagwaan poor bazaar cese nambar 46 / 86 ko aadhaar banaakar sigrival kii loksabhaa sadsyta radd karne ke liye yachika 2014 daayar kiya tha
 After three years of hearing, the court argued that due to lack of information Sigriwal could not mention in affidavit, there is no need to cancel the membership after 3 years
 sigrival ke vakil es di sanjay kaa kahana he ki prabhunath singh court main ye sabit nahi kar sake ki sigrival ne jaanboojh kar is cese kaa zikr nahi kiya tha
 In such a case, the court dismissed the petition of Prabhunath Singh
 patna hoicourt kaa yah nirnay bijepi ke liye raahat lekar aayaa he kyonki patna hoicourt ne hi isse pehle sasaram ke bijepi saansad chhedi paswan kii sadsyta radd kar di thi jisaki vajah se wo raashtrapati or uparashtrapati ke chunaav main vot nahi daal sake

 After the withdrawal of support, BJP Legislature Party leader Das told reporters that he handed over the letter to the Governor withdrawing support from the state government to all 18 mlas of the party
 ab rajyapal ko rajya ke bhavishya ke bare main faisla karnaa he

 Yes, the story is of South Carolina, USA, where in a risky operation, police rescued a girl hidden in a container
 baat june 2017 kii he
 The girl was taken hostage by a goth slayer
 wo kaatil pehle us ladki ke bwoyfriend kaa qatl kar chukaa tha
 The mauka-e-vardat was in a residential area

 Now in view of all the evidence, the American court has sentenced him to life imprisonment

 soobe main bijepi or jeemem (jharkhand mukti morcha) ke bich chal rahi siyaasi dangal main jubaani jang ab apni seemaa langhane lagi he
 On the occasion of the 39th Foundation Day celebrations of JMM in Dumka, the party's working president Hemant Soren termed the BJP as a monster and said that the BJP has been slowly occupying the entire country from Delhi to the demon and independent agencies of the country
 It has taken all the pillars of democracy in its pocket
 vahiin bijepi ne hemanth sorain par bhrashtachar kaa aarope lagaate hue kaha ki hemanth ne kai cell companiyon ke sahare mani londring kii he
 Former Chief Minister and JMM working president Hemant Soren, while addressing a huge public meeting at the historic Gandhi Maidan of allan-e-jangdumka from Santhalpargana, has put the state government on its target
 party netaa hemanth sorain nebijepiki tulana ek rakshas se karte hue kaha ki is desh main janata ko ab nyaay milanaa mushkil ho gaya he kyonki desh kii sabhi swatantra agencia bijepi ke ishaaron par chal rahi he
 In such a situation, people will now have to go to the Jan Adalat for justice
 unhone bijepi ke adivasee or dalit prem par bhi sawaal uthaaya
 Rejecting bjp's JMMK allegations, BJP MLA Ram Kumar Pahan alleged that Hemant Soren was running several cell companies under the guise of a person named Ravi Kejriwal
 in companiyon kii madad se unhone mani londring kii he
 It is said that Ravi Kejriwal used to work loudspeakers in meetings
 baad main shibu sorain ke sampark main aane ke baad achaanak kismat ne palati khai or wo karodon main khilne laga
 It is alleged that during the peak days of Shibu Soren, the Kejriwal family was responsible for making money for the Shibu family and wasting money

 After he became the Emergency Secretary, it was said that the Soren family used to do politics and the rest of the work was done by Prayag Kejriwal and Manohar Pal

 In such a situation, JMM has started working on a strategy to surround BJP by organizing a huge public meeting in Dumka
 yuva dalit netaa chandrashekhar aaazaad urf ravan chaahe mayawati kaa virodh karte nahin dikhte hai par bahujan samaaj party (basapa) supremeo mayawati shaayad unki maujuudagi se khatra mahasoos kar rahi hai
 Mayawati has directly declared the Bhim Army leader Chandrashekhar as a spy of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)
 bhim army ke pramukh chandrashekhar ke banaras se chunaav ladane kii ghoshnaa par mayawati ne bhaajapa ko nishane par liya or kaha ki," daliton kaa vot baantkar bhaajapa ko phayda pahunchane ke liye hi bhaajapa bhim army ke chandrasekhar ko varanasi loksabhaa seat se chunaav ladava rahi he "
 In her attack, Mayawati called Chandrashekhar a BJP spy and said that the BJP is contesting Chandrasekhar for the purpose of dividing the votes of Dalits
 mayawati ne yah bhi aarope lagaaya he ki bhim army ko bhaajapa ne hi banwaaya he
 Mayawati alleges that the BJP first tried to send Chandrasekhar to the BSP to carry out intelligence
 chandrashekhar ko lekar mayawati kaa aisa bayaan pehali baar nahin aayaa he
 Even earlier, he denied any political relationship with Chandrasekhar
 to kya bure daur se guzar rahi mayawati or basapa ko siyaasi sanjivani kii jarurat nahin thi? kya basapa ko nematon kii tarah mil rahaa chandrashekhar jaisaa urjavan netaa nahin chahie? kya mayawati kanshiram se viraasat main mili apni raajnneeti kaa khajaana bhi baaki vanshavaadiyon kii tarah apane parivaar ko hi saunpna chaahati hai yaa unhen chandrashekhar main apane vaaris kii bajaae pratidwandvi or khatra najar aade laga he
 Devendra Shukla, Senior Fellow of Election and Media Research at c Voter and political commentator, explains the incident as “dalit population in Uttar Pradesh is around 21% to 23%
 daliton kaa yah samaaj do hisson main banta he
 One, the Jatavs who constitute around 14% of the population and who are Mayawati's fraternity
 chandrashekhar bhi jatav hai
 So fear of Mayawati is bound to happen
 mandal andolan main daliton ke jatav vot vaale hisse kii raajnneeti se basapa majboot ban
 Just like SP with the support of Yadavs in OBC
 mandal andolan tak dalit, obisi or muslim congress ke vot the
 But it got divided between these two parties
 gaiyr-jatav voton kii aabaadi kariban 8% he
 There are 50-60 castes and sub-castes among them and this vote is divided
 "yah vibhajit vot hi kabhi bhaajapa ko to kabhi congress ko majbootee detaa he
 Then why did Mayawati advise BSP workers to stay away from Chandrashekhar? Seeing the face of defeat in the last three elections and the successive vote share and the loss in the base, the Shatru Party is ready to join hands with the Samajwadi Party but why is it keeping distance from leaders like Chandrasekhar? Shukla reminds Are, "this time brought Chandrashekhar out of jail to BJP, but took him away to Congress
 mayawati ke mukaable bhaajapa mukhya pratidwandvi he
 To prevent the split in Jatav votes, Mayawati called Chandrashekhar an agent of the BJP
 kyonki agar vah unhen congress kaa agent bataati to isse dalit congress ke paksh main ekajute hi hote
 Dalits have never been against Congress
 "to kya kya chandrashekhar se duuri banaae rakhane main mayawati kaa ateet aade aa rahaa he? kanshiram ke baad basapa par niyantran ke liye mayawati ko bahut kuch karnaa padaa tha
 Why did Mayawati not allow any leader of the second line in the BSP to be ready? Why any leader whose height grew, he could not stand in the BSP? What is the reason that big leaders have been removed from BSP? Whom is Mayawati always worried about? The answer is the same: insecurity
 mayawati kii basapa main koi number do nahin he
 There is no second line of leadership
 mayawati agar congress se duuri banaakar chal rahi hai to uske peeche bhi yahi soch he ki koi unke dalit vot bank main send na laga le jo 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main unki party ke sifer rahane par bhi kariban 19 fisadi tak sabut tha
 Congress can do this work
 khaskar, priyanka gandhi wadra ke chunavi maidan main khulkar aa jane ke baad se mayawati ne congress par hamale tej kar die hai kyonki mayawati ke dalit vot bank main sapa send nahin laga sakati
 But such apprehension always persists from the Congress
 iske saath hi unhen yahi dar bhaajapa se bhi laga rahata he
 In the 2017 assembly elections, the Dalit vote also turned towards the BJP and in 2014 it also happened in Uttar Pradesh
 to kya yahi vajah he ki sapa ke akhilesh yadav kii ichha ke baavjood mayawati uttar pradesh main congress ke saath gathjod karne main anicchhuk rahi hai
 Mayawati is also attacking the minimum income scheme for the poor through tweets
 mayawati ne rupye dekar garibi dur karne ke congress ke daawey par bhi sawaal uthaae hai
 In fact, behind the SP-BSP alliance, a theory of sephology is working which is called Index of Opposition Unity (index of Unity / Scattering in Opposition Parties)
 vipakshi dalon kaa jitna adhik bikharaav hoga utana ioyu utana hi kam hoga
 That is, if there is a triangular fight in a seat, the winning party will need only one third of the vote
 par congress ke aane se ganit kharaab ho gaya he or mayawati ko ashanka he ki uske vot bank par congress na daawa thonk de
 Shukla says, what will happen if the BJP is surrounded? Even if Chandrasekhar is on the pretext of targeting the BJP, the ultimate advantage will be for the BJP and the loss will be for the BSP
 vah aage samajhaate hai, "savarna aadhaar vaali bhaajapa ko gherne se 17 anusuchit jatiyon vaali arakshit siton par dalit or muslim voton ko ekajute kiya ja sakegaa
 But this will push the upper caste votes on the general seats
 agar dhruvikaran hua to basapa ko sabase adhik nuksaan hoga"vah saath main jodate hai, basapa sabhi arakshit siton par chunaav nahin jitati he
 It has always won seats where the Dalit population is high but that seat is not reserved
 vahaan dalit aabaadi umadakar basapa ko vot karti he
 According to experts, this attitude of the BSP supremo will ultimately give rise to the expectations of the BJP and only BJP will get it

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi celebrated his 68th birthday on Sunday
 modi ke janmdinpar deshbhar se tamaam mashhoor hastiyon ne unhen shubhakamanaayen bhejin or jagah-jagah kai aayojan bhi hue lekin andhra pradesh ke kisaanon ne piem modi ko is maukey par jo gift bheja wo gift kam or apane dard se piem ko parichit karaane kaa ek idia zyada tha
 In fact, Andhra Pradesh farmers sent 68 paise checks to PM Modi on his birthday
 khabaron kii maane to kisaanon ne ye check karjamaafee ke naam par apane saath ho rahe majaak ke virodh main bheje
 The Rayalaseema Saguniti Sadhana Samiti (RSSS) of Andhra Pradesh collected thousands of checks on behalf of farmers, these checks were worth 68 paise
 is samiti ne ye check kisaanon kii khastahalat kii taraf sarkaar kaa dhyaan aakarshith karne ke liye bheje
 They say that despite having resources here, Rayalaseena is one of the most backward areas of the country
 aresases ke mutabik karanul, anantpur, chitoor or kadappa jaise ilaakon main pani kii baari kami he jabaki krishna or panna jaisi nadiyaan yaheen se hokar guzarati hai
 The institution says that the leaders have no concern about the problems and distress of the farmers of Rayalaseema
 unhen ummid he ki unke is kadam ke baad sarkaar kaa dhyaan unki pareshaaniyon par jayega or modi kisaanon ke liye sinchai kii acchhee vyavastha ke liye vishesh anudaan kii ghoshnaa karenge
 Let us tell you that on the occasion of his birthday, PM inaugurated the Hussardar Sarovar Dam, which is the second largest dam in the world, ending the 56 year long wait of Gujarat
 is baandh kii oonchai 138 meter or lambaai 1
 2 kilometers
 mana ja rahaa he ki isse gujarat ke hajaaron gaanvon ke saath maharashtra ke 37, 500 hectare ilaake tak sinchai kii suvidha hogi
 Jalore and Barmer, Rajasthan's two drought-hit districts, will quench the thirst of 2 lakh 46 thousand hectares and provide drinking water to 9,633 villages in Gujarat
 gujarat chunaav main is baar kagress soch samaj kar ‘soft hindutv’ kaa card khel rahi he or is ranneeti se tus se mas nahin hona chaahati
 Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi himself seems to stand on this line
 gujarat chunaav ke maddenjar rajya kii pehali do yatraaon main rahul kai mandiron main darshan karte najar aae to navadurga pandalon main unhone aarti bhi kii
 In this context, when Rahul resumed his tour of Gujarat from November 1, he made it clear that he would hold the line of 'soft Hindutva' even if the area was minority-majority
 buudhvaar ko rahul ne teen din ke daure kii shuruyaat bharuch jile ke jambusar se kii
 This area is considered to be a minority
 rahul ke pahunchane se pehle hi raily sthal bharaa hua najar aane laga tha
 It was known at a glance that a large number of minorities also came to listen to Rahul
 congress ko ye ashanka thi ki gujarat kaa ye chunaav sampradayik line par naa chalaa jaae or dhruvikaran se kahin uskaa nuksaan naa ho jaae
 But at the same time it was a question for the Congress how to leave the minority area completely without campaigning
 isi kashmakash main party ne ek tarika ijad kiya
 It was decided that Rahul would do only one rally and one road show in this area
 jambusar main rahul ke manch par pahunchate hi elaan hua ki kshetra ke sant mahant sabase pehle rahul ko puja archana karaayenge or aashirwad denge
 It was also done in a hurry
 ye apane aap main dekhne vaala tha ki jis raily main adhiktar alpsankhyak najar aa rahe the, vahaan manch par rahul ke bhaashan se pehle puja-archana congress or rahul kii siyasat kaa rukh saaf bataa rahi thi
 After the rally in Jambusar, Rahul's convoy left for tribal dominated area
 raste main kai jagah alpsankhyak ilaakon main sadak chauraahon par umadi bheed ke baavjood rahul sirf abhivadan karte hue aage bad jate hai
 Usually Rahul is looking at a place like this where more people gather, then he is sure to take out the mike from his bus and say something
 lekin buudhvaar ko alpsankhyak bahul ilaake main unhone aisa kuch nahin kiya
 Despite the crowd, Rahul's gesture made him feel that he wanted to move faster by merely registering his presence in the area
 congress beshak khud ko dharm yaa jaat-paant kii raajnneeti se dur bataati he
 But this time in Gujarat, he is in a mood to move forward by firmly sticking the card of soft Hindutva to the chest
 rahul gujarat yatraaon main mandiron yaa navadurga pandalon main janaa jis tarah nahin bhul rahe us tarah wo alpsankhyakon ke dharmasthalon ke liye nahin kar rahe
 Under this strategy of the Congress, Ahmed Patel, the party's political leader and Sonia's political secretary, has kept himself completely on the backfoot in the Gujarat elections
 gujarat se hi taalluk rakhane vaale ahamed patel rahul kii pehali do yatraaon se puri tarah dur rahe
 When Rahul's third journey started from Bharuch, Ahmed Patel's home district, he appeared
 lekin ahamed patel kii puri koshish yahi rahi ki un par koi focus naa aae
 That is why he gave a short speech from Rahul's stage only at a few places, that too in Gujarati
 zyaadaatar jagahon par bhale hi wo manch par baithe lekin unhone khud hi bhaashan dene se duuri banaae rakhi
 At one place, Rahul requested him, then he went and gave a mere 5-minute speech in Gujarati
 rahul gujarat ke is daure main alpsankhyak bahul ilaake main prachaar ke thik agle din unaayi mata ke darshan karne jaaenge
 Congress is taking steps forward by blowing the flame
 congress kii puri koshish he ki bijepi ko kahin se bhi ye mauka naa mili ki wo uske soft hindutv ke card par pani pherane kaa prayaas kare
 This is the reason why Rahul is putting full emphasis in the philosophy and circumambulation of temples
 kul milakar congress kaa daanv saaf he ki chunaav sangram main agar wo bahusankhyak matadaataaon ko lekarbijepise gujarat main muqabla karne main kaamyaab hoti he to alpsankhyak matadaata to uskaa saath de hi denge
 From this strategy of the Congress, it seems that she somewhere believes that she has been losing in the last elections in Gujarat due to the allegations of Muslim appeasement
 yahi vajah he ki congress kaa haath gujarat main soft hindutv ke saath najar aa rahaa he

 It happened that in a television comedy show, comedian Kapil Sharma asked a question related to John Abraham, then Bipasha immediately said to Kapil, "who John?" apni film 'alon' ko promot karne bipasha basu is kamedi sho main pahunchi thi
 He was also present here with his film hero Karan Singh Grover
 tabhi kapil sharma ne bollywood abhinaytaon kii fitness or personality se jude sawaal puche
 When Kapil asked Bipasha how much number would he give to Anil Kapoor in 10, then Bipasha gave number 7 to Anil Kapoor

 As soon as Kapil took the name of John Abraham, Bipasha immediately said "who John?" mazaaq main hi sahi lekin bipasha ne television par saafe kah diya ki vah jon ko nahin jaanati
 This is the same John with whom Bipasha had love issues

 When we like a photo or a photo affects us, we want to know its full story
 ham jaananaa chaahate hai ki kin halaat main ye photo bani
 What was seen next in this photo
 or aisa kya he jo is photo main nahin dikh rahaa lekin ghatit hua tha
 That's why aajtak
 in ne is tasviir ko apane camere main kaid karne vaale varisht photo patrkaar ravi choudhary se baat kii
 Ravi is associated with news agency PTI
 aage kii puri kahani ravi choudhary se hi suniye:-hamen jaankaree thi ki kisaan aaj dilli main daakhil ho sakate hai or police unhen dilli-upi border ke paas roak sakati he
 So i reached here at seven in the morning
 kaaphi der intjaar karne ke baad kisaanon kaa ek chota samooh 9 baje ke aasapaas pahunchaa
 Around 11000 farmers arrived around 11 o'clock
 kuch kisaan peeche, thodi duuri par ruke hue the
 There was also a barricading of the UP Police on the way to the farmers
 us bairicade ko kisaanon ne hataa diya or upi police ke javaanon ne bhi ek tarah se unhen rasta de diya
 Now the batch of farmers reached the second barricade with their tractor-trolley
 ye bairicade dilli police ne lagaaya tha
 On one side there was a group of enthusiastic farmers and on the other side of the barricade, Delhi Police personnel and water canon carts were standing
 main apane kuch photographer saathiyon ke saath is sadak se lage fliover par khadaa tha
 The farmers had flags in their hands
 police ke jawan bhi danda or aansu gas ke gole chhodane vaale gan se las the
 The farmers were trying to go further, shouting slogans
 wo apni tractor se bairicade ko hilaane kii koshish bhi kar rahe the
 Police started using water canons on the farmers around 11:30 am
 qareeb-qareeb das minute tak police ne kisaanon par iskaa istemaal kiya
 Soon after, they started firing tear gas shells
 main kai or pradarshan cover kar chukaa hum or us hisaab se kahuun to police ne kaafii der tak kisaanon par pani barsaaya or aansu gas ke gole daage
 The farmers were dispersed by this action
 unke jhandon main se kapadaa gaayab ho gaya or unke haath main keval danda rah gaye
 The farmers started throwing something towards the police
 unamem kaaphi gussa tha
 That's when i saw something happening on the roadside
 maine apane camere kaa zum badhaayaa to dikhaa ki police ke danda ke jawaab main ek bujurg kisaan ne bhi danda uthaaya hua he
 i found this scene quite touching
 aksar jab police kii laathiyaan chalati hai to log bhaag khadey hote hai yaa police kii lathi se khud ko bachaane kii koshish karte hai
 But here it was not so
 tasviir main aap dekh sakate hai ki ek taraf police ke kai jawan hai vahiin duusari taraf wo(kisaan) akele khadey hai
 i have been in the field for many years
 har kuch din main ek baar pradarshnakariyon or police ko aamane-saamne paata hum lekin aaj se pehle maine aisa koi drishy nahin dekha tha
 In this picture, the anger of an elderly farmer is challenging the strength of the system
 maanon wo kah rahaa he, ham haare nahin hai
 i have been doing photo journalism since 2008
 aisi kisi bhi sthiti main kaam karnaa bahut mushkil hota he
 But we work under similar conditions
