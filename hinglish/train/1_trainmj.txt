 Congress President Sonia Gandhi says that there are different challenges in every phase of politics
 'aaj tak' ne sonia gandhi se exclusive baatcheet kii
 Sonia Gandhi believes that in politics, faces also change and emerge with time
 sonia se varisht patrkaar rajdeep saradesai ne khaas baatcheet kii
 Rajdeep: Some people believe that the Congress needs a leader like Indira Gandhi at this time? Sonia: Every time there are different challenges and then the faces also change according to the time
 rajdeep:log kehete hai ki narendra modi indira gandhi jaise majboot netaa hai?sonia:main is baat se sahamat nahin hum, indira or unki raajnneeti ko mat bhuuliye
 Bongi became the President, then PM
 lekin unka majaak banaaya gaya
 He was humiliated
 party ke bheetar hi unhen nishaanaa banaaya gaya
 But he did not give up, compete and won
 rajdeep:kya aapane ladane kaa jajba indira gandhi se siikhaa he? kyonki pehle aapako nishane par liya gaya or ab rahul gandhi par hamale ho rahe hai? kya aapako lagata he ki party ko or badalane kii jarurat he, kyonki 60-70 ke dashak main modi ji jaise netaa nahin the?sonia:har daur main apane tarah kii chunautiyaan or raajnneetik chehre hote hai
 So there is no need to change the party
 mujhe lagata he ki congress kii maujuuda ranneeti bilkul sahi he
 Rajdeep: People accuse Indira Gandhi of promoting dynasty in Congress? Sonia: This charge is wrong, Jawaharlal Nehru was the leader of the people
 indira gandhi loktantric tareeke se chunakar ai thim, unhone dharmanirpekshata par bal diya
 People joined together and the party strengthened
 phir party ne ye tay kiya kise aage karnaa he
 Indira acted only in the interest of the poor
 rajdeep:indira gandhi se aapaki pehali mulaakaat kab hui thi?sonia:indira ji se pehali mulaakaat landan main hui thi, indira ji ko rajeev or mere bich nazdikiyon kii khabar lagi thi to unhone mujhase poocha ki tum rajeev se shaadi karnaa chaahati ho
 He always encouraged me to move forward
 main chaahati thi ki rajeev raajnneeti main nahin jaaen
 Rajdeep: Is this the most difficult time for the Congress when it got just 44 seats in the Lok Sabha? raajnneeti main ye sab chalate rahata he
 The policy of the party does not change with the victory or defeat
 rajdeep:jis din indira gandhi par hamale hue the, aap kahaan thim or aapako kaise pataa chalaa?sonia:diwali kii taiyaariyaan chal rahi thi, main apane kamare main the, achaanak kisi kii rone or cheekhney kii aawaaj ai
 When we got out we were told that Indira ji has been attacked
 phir hamane dekha ki wo jameen par giri hui thim or unke sharir par kai goliyaan lagi thim
 i could not understand what happened
 unako uthaakar lekar ames gaye lekin unhen bachaa nahin paae

 There is a clear bias towards each other in creating a framework for the sharing of resources
 donon ek-duusare par andhra pradesh punargathan adhinium main kuch praavdhaanon kii gambhir upeksha karne kaa aarope laga rahe hai
 Their motive is to cash in on the sentiments of the administrative people as well as to preserve the vote bank
 sachaai yah he ki donon rajya paise kii tangi se jujh rahe hai
 Both have earned Rs one lakh crore
 kaa bajet pesh kiya he par donon ko hi nahin pataa ki itnaa paisa ve kahaan se jutaayenge
 They are looking towards the center with hope, so that the promises they made in the election announcement can be fulfilled

 The government will bring the SC / ST amendment bill in this Parliament session
 jabaki monsoon satr ke samaapt hone main mahaj ek saptaah kaa samay bachaa hua he
 The Modi government wants to put the reality of political parties on the Dalit issue in front of the people through this bill
 kyonki isse saaf ho jayega ki koun dal daliton ke saath hai or koun si party khilaaf
 If the government strategists believe that many opposition parties can obstruct this bill in Rajya Sabha
 aise main sarkaar ke paas vipaksh ko gherne kaa ek acha mauka haath aa jayega
 Please tell that the bench of two judges of the Supreme Court gave a decision to change the SC / ST Act in March this year
 jisamen supreme court ne kaha tha ki essi / asti maamle main FIR darj karne se pehle koi praarambhik jaanch kii jaae
 Prior arrest will have to be taken to arrest the accused
 iske alaava CRPC kii dhara 438 anusuchit jati evam anusuchit janajati atyaachaar nivaaran kanoon par lagu hogi
 This decision of the Supreme Court caused a stir in the country's politics

 iske baad modi sarkaar ne aashwaasan diya gaya tha sarkaar maamle kii dubaara sunwaayee ke liye court main rivyuu patishan daayar karengi
 If there is no change in the Supreme Court's decision even after the review petition, then the government will change the Supreme Court's decision to restore the old and original form by bringing SC / ST amendment bill in the Parliament
 modi sarkaar ne ise maamle main rivyuu patishan daayar kii or tab se ye maamla court main he
 After this, on the instructions of the Prime Minister, a ministerial group was formed in this matter
 isamen grahamantri rajnath singh, ramvilas paswan, kanoon mantri ravishankar prasad or saamaajik nyaay or adhikrita mantri thavar chand gahalot ko shaamil kiya gaya
 Dalit organizations have once again given an ultimatum to the Modi government that if by August 9, the SC ST Act is not enacted in the old form, then they will stage a massive protest
 is maamle main dikkat tab ai jab endie kii sahyogi dal algepi kii taraf se ram vilaas paswan ke bete saansad chiraag paswan ne modi sarkaar ko patr likhaa
 If the SC does not bring the bill for the old form of the ST Act or bring an ordinance, then on August 9, his party will join the Bharat Bandh by the Dalit army
 chiraag paswan ne yahaan tak kah diya tha kii jarurat padane par bada faisla le sakate hai
 Chirag's demands were also supported by the JDU
 vipaksh ke dalon ne bhi kahaan kii sarkaar ko is par faisla lenaa chahie
 If sources are to be believed, the Modi government has decided to amend the SC ST Act in the old form after brainstorming on the basis of a ground report in this entire matter
 darasal 9 agast ko 'bharat band' ke dauraan hone vaale jaan-maal nuksaan kaa thikra ek baar modi sarkaar par footataa
 With this, the opposition would have tried to make the image of the Modi government anti-dalit
 chiraag paswan ke anusaar agar algepi bhi yadi is bharat main shaamil hoti endie kii ekta par sawaal uthte jo modi sarkaar or bijepi ke liye acha nahin hota
 Only after this, the government has taken steps for amendment
 sarkaar ke is kadam ke baad algepi adhyaksh or kendriya mantri ramvilas paswan ne twit karke kaha, pradhanmantri ke netritv main cabinet ne aitihaasik faisla liya ki essi / asti act1989 main mahatvapurn badlaav kar use supreme court ke 20 march 2018 ke faisle se pehle kii sthiti ko behaal kiya jayega
 If the Modi government is able to pass the amendment bill in both the houses of Parliament, then it can get benefit in this year's assembly elections and 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 bijepi iske jariye daliton ke bich sandesh dene kii koshish karegi ki modi sarkaar dalit virdohi nahin balki dalit hitaishi he
 Meaning that the government is carrying laddus in both hands on this issue

 Police did not know how many thousand raids, seized millions of liters of liquor, but in one case this law seems helpless
 maamla nyaaypalika se judaa hua he, isliye police bhi lagaataar is maamle main pardaa daalane main lagi he
 The case of liquor found in the bottle of mini water is related to an accident in which two motorcycle-borne youths are killed, but the vehicle with which the accident took place had blue lights
 yahi nahin durghatana ke baad us car kaa driver ghayal or savaar faraar ho gaye tab pataa chalaa ki gaadi kii pichhali seat par sharaab kii khaali bottle miniral water or kuch khaane kii chijen rakhi hui thi
 Apparently, the program of drinking alcohol was going on in the moving vehicle, but due to the accident, this thing also came to the fore
 jis gadee se durghatana hui uskaa nambar biaar-01 pibi 5569 he
 When the car owner was searched by the court's SGM number, it was found out that the vehicle is of ACGM-9 Sanjay Kumar Rai, who is posted in Gaya Court
 neeli batti kii gaadi privet gaadi se durghatana or durghatnagrast gaadi main sharaab kaa paaya janaa ek bahut badi ghatana thi or wo bhi bihar main, jahaan sharabbandi kaa kadaa kanoon lagu he
 The police should take immediate action on this, but no police has not taken any action so far, while the matter is on Monday

 Police are denying that the vehicle contained alcohol
 soshal media main jab isaki tasviir vyler hui to police ne haasyaaspad bayaan dete hue kaha ki gaadi se sharaab kii bottle nahin balki petrol baraamad hui he
 Police say it is being investigated
 halaki exiaar main gaadi se sharaab kii bottle milane kaa koi zikr nahin he
 Now the question arises whether the man sitting on the back seat of the car was drinking petrol instead of alcohol
 uth rahe hai ye sawalbihar main sharabbandi ke khilaaf police ne muhim ched rakhi he
 From the common man to the high-profile people, no offense is being taken to send them to jail on the issue of alcohol, but in this case the police seems to be evasive because the matter is related to the judiciary
 privet gaadi main batti lagaana bhi supreme court ke aadesh kaa ulanghghan he
 Yes, the police is also investigating whether the ACGM itself was present in the vehicle at the time of the accident
 agar wo maujuud nahin the to gaadi main neeli batti lagaana gaiyrkanoonee he
 The question is also being raised that if someone is drinking alcohol in a hotel, then if there is an FIR against the owner of that hotel then why not take action on the person who got the bottle of liquor in the car

 On Saturday, when lawyers and policemen witnessed violence in Delhi's Tis Hazari court, lawyers allegedly assaulted a woman police officer in uniform there
 isi ke saath usee din se unki loded bandook bhi laapata he
 In a CCTV footage near NDTV, it can be seen that the policemen are trying to set the vehicles on fire outside the room in which they have locked themselves to avoid a mob of lawyers
 jhadap ke chaar din baad bhi dilli police ne apni mahila adhikari ke maamle main koi shikaayat darj nahin kii he, jinke saath tees hajaari court main vakeelon ne marpet kii
 a woman officer of the Indian Police Service reportedly said that her loaded 9mm service pistol had been missing since Saturday
 lekin dilli police ne kathith rup se iske liye bhi exiaar darj karne se manaa kar diya
 a senior official told NDTV that the female officer told her colleagues that making a formal complaint would not yield any results, which would prove a fool in itself
 aadhikarik taur par, police kaa daawa he ki ve aupchaarik shikaayat ke bina koi karrwai nahin kar sakate
 But in cases of sexual harassment, the police has the right to take action on its own
 ek adhikari ne bataaya, 'police par jaanch tej karne or samvedansheel muddon ko dabaane ke liye bahut dabaav he
 So the senior officials who were told about both these incidents are also silent on this
 vastav main, mahila adhikari ko maamle ko aage na badhaane ke sanket mili hai
 On Saturday, a policeman asked three lawyers to remove the wrongly parked car, following which the dispute arose
 iske baad hui hinsa main 30 log jakhmi ho gaye
 NDTV has found footage of several CCTV cameras, in which lawyers are seen attacking policemen and trying to set bikes on fire
 vahiin, pulicekarmi aag par pani daalkar use bujhaate hue dikh rahe hai
 The lawyers wanted that the police constable who prevented his comrades from parking the car should be handed over to them
 maukey par maujuud ek adhikari ne yaad karte hue bataaya, 've (vakil) itane gusse main the ki consteble ko vardi badalakar saadhe kapade pahanane ke liye kaha gaya
 After changing the uniforms, criminals were seated in lockups to avoid angry lawyers

 The state BJP said, it is 'fully' ready to face fresh elections immediately

 The letter of the Lieutenant Governor is likely to be replied by the Center after Diwali
 haalanki, bijepi yah kahati aa rahi he ki uparajyapal se aamantran milane ke baad dilli main sarkaar gathan ke bare main vah koi faisla karegi
 BJP sources said that many central leaders and the RSS are not in favor of manipulating the government and have indicated to the state leadership to be ready for the elections
 uparajyapal ne raashtrapati ko bheji gai apni report main kaha he, chunki dilli main sarkaar gathan ke liye kisi bhi party ne daawa nahin kiya he isliye bijepi ko sarkaar banane ke liye aamantrit kiya ja saktaa he kyonki vidhansabha main vah sabase badi party he

 sadhvi pragna ne taaja bayaan main kaha ki vah na sirf babari masjid ke upar chadhi thim, balki use giraane main bhi madad kii thi
 Taking immediate action, the Election Commission also served a notice to Sadhvi Pragya for violating the Election Code

 Amar Singh, a former leader of the Samajwadi Party in the country's politics, has the ability to fit every slot
 lakhanu main ek kaarykram main pradhanmantri narendra modi ne jab amar singh kaa naam lete hue udyogpatiyon or rajanetaaon kii santh-ganth kaa zikr kiya to ek baar phir raajnneeti kii mukhya dhara main amar singh praasangik ho gaye
 Perhaps this is the reason that now the market of speculation about Amar Singh joining BJP is hot

 Amar Singh says that 'I am not making any effort (to join BJP)
 main modi ji ko pasand karata hum or unke samarthan main khadaa hum

 Amar Singh, who once again came into the limelight after PM Modi's program in Lucknow, was invited by Om Prakash Rajbhar, chief of bjp's ally Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party in UP, to contest the party from Azamgarh
 is prastaav par jawaab dete hue amar singh kaa kahana he ki unki rajbhar se is sambandh main koi baat nahin hui
 He still has four years in the Rajya Sabha
 lihaaja ve kisi ek kshetra se sanlagn nahin hokar puure uttar pradesh kaa bhraman karnaa chahta hai or agar sambhav ho to puure desh kaa
 Please tell that former SP leader Amar Singh met UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on 23 July
 jiske baad raajnneetik halkon main atakalein lagaayi jane lagi thim ki vah bhaajapa main shaamil ho sakate hai
 It is notable that Amar Singh recently said, 'BJP is a big political party
 main yah nahin kahuunga ki mauka milane par main bhaajapa main shaamil nahin hounga lekin mujhe mauka koun de rahaa he
 i have not made any request

 There is hardly any person in the world who can expect an animal to behave like humans
 or thik isi tarah shaayad duniya kaa koi jaanavar bhi ye ummid nahin karata hoga ki khud ko sabhy kehane vaala insaan uski tarah jaanavar ban jaae
 Now the animal could not become a human being
 par haa insaan jab-tab khud ko jaanavar jarur bana letaa he
 Had it not been so, a leopard would not have eaten thirty bullets in six seconds
 ek tendue ke encounter ko dekhakar ye andaja lagaana mushkil he ki inamen insaan koun he or jaanavar koun? kyonki khud ko insaan kehane vaale tamaam insaan jo harakat kar rahe hai waisi harakat to shaayad jaanwaron main bhi insaanon ke saath nahin hoti hogi
 Dead leopard was also shot
 vaise ye jaanavar is vakt bebas naa hota to shaayad in insaanon kii itani himmat bhi naa hoti
 But everyone present here knows that whatever they do with it at this time, they will bear it quietly
 kyonki murde kabhi virodh nahin karte
 They are just on the mercy of the living
 goliyaan lagane ke baad tendua mar chukaa he
 And that's why it is helpless
 or uski bebasii kaa phayda uthaa kar ye insaan alag-alag angel se alag-alag poj main khilakhilaate or muskuraate hue uski tasviren utaar rahe hai
 And this young man is telling stories of his bravery
 ye tandua naa to aatankwaadi tha or naa hi isane sarhad paar se ghuspaith kii thi
 It had just wandered the Kashmir Valley due to snow and came close to the settlement
 haa, isane kuch insaanon ko jakhmi karne kaa gunaah jarur kiya tha
 But was this his punishment? This sad story has come from Anantnag district of Kashmir Valley
 jile ke mirpura ilaake main kuch dinon se ek tendua dikhaai de rahaa tha
 Due to the heavy snowfall in the valley, it may have lost its way and reached close to the township from the forest
 kuch insaanon se uskaa saamana bhi hua or unhen usne ghayal kar diya
 Meanwhile, on Monday morning, news was received that the leopard is close to the settlement
 tendua ke basti main hone kii baat kai dinon se thi par is dauraan van vibhaag nadaarad tha
 As soon as the news of the leopard spread on Monday morning, the army personnel present in the surrounding areas along with the forest department also followed the leopard
 kiske kehane par pataa nahin
 On seeing such a large number of soldiers, the settlers were also surprised
 phir kya tha kuch hi der main puri basti bhi ikatthi ho gai
 The leopard search began after this
 basti vaale danda se las the to jawan eke-47 se
 Where the leopard was seen, the habitation would run him
 insaanon or tendue ke bich ye luka-chupa ghanton jari rahi
 During this, the army personnel fired several rounds
 phir aakhirkaar ek jagah tendua gir padaa
 Was almost unconscious or perhaps dead
 par usamen harakat jaraa bhi nahin ho rahi thi
 He may have already been shot

 dami candidet tabhi pakadaa jaataa he jab uski gaadi se kisi or kii chunaav saamagree yaa jhanda baraamad ho
 To fight the assembly elections, there is a bail amount of only 10 thousand rupees
 kisi ke chunaav ladane par roak nahin he isliye aksar netaa dami candidet kaa sahaara lete hai
 These dummies can also be independents and can also belong to an unknown party registered in the Election Commission
 upi main pichley vidhansabha chunaav main 403 siton par kul 223 partiyon ke ummidavaaron ne chunaav ladaa tha
 According to an estimate, at least 2 thousand dummy candidates were raised in the last election in UP
 ek baar phir upi chunaav kii taiyaariyaan chal rahi hai to dami candidet bechney vaali dukaane khul chuki hai
 How are the dummy candidates running these shops selling and what is the rate of each dummy candidate? You can read this shocking disclosure - Wasi Ahmed - Listen, the dummy thing is that my party is also registered
 main usase dami khadaa kar duungaa
 From 'rashtriya Awami Dal'
 wo bhi sin meraa hi hota he
 Reporter - Which other party is you told? Wasi Ahmed - 'national Awami Dal', i am also the national president 
 reporter-ye chunaav ayog main registerd he?vasi ahamed-haa, registerd he
 Wasi Ahmed hails from Bareilly, the national convener of an organization called All India Muslim Majlis
 lekin upi chunaav main dami candidet vaali deal karne ke liye ye dilli tak pahunch gaye
 When the special team of 'aaj Tak' found themselves in Delhi as electoral campaigners of a political party for UP, Wasi revealed a party called 'rashtriya Awami Dal'
 reporter-'rashtriya awami dal'
 When was it done? Wasi ahmed-yeh in 2002
 reporter-isi naam se he?vasi ahamed-haa, 'rashtriya awami dal'reporter-lekin is naam par, 'rashtriya awami dal' par kabhi koi ellection ladvaya he aapane?vasi ahamed-haa 2002 main essembly ellection ladvaya 10
 From the Reporter-10 seat? Wasi ahmed-yes, fought
 reporter-upi?vasi ahamed-upi, aapaki dua se
 Wasi Ahmad has fielded a dummy candidate from 10 seats in 2002 in the name of the Rashtriya Awami Dal, which were fought for electoral gains for candidates of other parties
 dami candidet ke phaayde ginaakar vasi ahamed deal karne lage
 Reporter - For my knowledge, tell me what are the advantages of a dummy? Wasi ahmad-dummy have these benefits, dummy carts are installed
 dami ke aadmi ko suraksha mil jaati hai
 He belongs to the worker
 security, gaadiyaan lekar us bajet se kuch candidate ne kharchaa idhar dikhaaya kuch uskaa dikhaaya
 Reporter - OK
 'rashtriya awami dal' upi main das log bhi is party kaa naam nahin jaanate honge
 But this party is registered in the Election Commission and when elections come, they open their shops for the benefit of other candidates
 aise kai chehre hai, aise kai anjaan rajnatik dal hai, jo upi chunaav se pehle raajnneeti ke darty game main lage hai
 One is Rajesh Bharti
 inaki bhi apni siyaasi dukaan he
 In the name of Swarashtra Jan Party, of which he is the president
 uttar pradesh ke mirzapur ke rajesh bharti ne apni party 2011 main chunaav ayog main registerd karwaai
 The dummy candidate business has been going on since then
 rajesh bharti-wo apni party kaa jhanda lagayegaa, aapaki party kaa jhanda nahin lagayegaa
 He will put up his poster, take the car in his name
 wo swayan ghoomegaa, ab ghumte samay samaaj main baith kar ke kya baaten karata he, wo aapaki baat kah degaa
 But that candidate will run for his party
 reporter -yahi to baat kah rahe hai
 Rajesh Bharti will promote propaganda
 aaj tak kii special invastigeshan team ne rajesh bharti jaise kai chunavi dhandhebaazon ko pakadaa, jo khaas taur par chunaav ke mausam main active ho jate hai or is firaaq main rahete hai ki koi bada rajnatik dal yaa koi ummidavaar unase dami candidet kii deal kar legaa
 a Shariq Usmani is the leader of a political party called 'apna Desh Party' and is in charge of this party in western Uttar Pradesh
 hamaari baatcheet main ye dami candidet ke sikret darty game ke master nikle
 Shariq Usmani - Man has all kinds of planning
 bhai dekhiye do chijen hai aajkal ke daur main, ab jo maahaul chal rahaa he, sabase pehle to aap paise se sab kuch kharid sakate hai, duusari baat aapaki niti aisi honi chahie kii aapaki baat uske dimag main aap kis tarah se bithaayenge ki wo aapaki baat maan le
 Shariq Usmani was willing to remove the dummy candidate from his party to benefit our candidate in the 2017 UP elections
 lekin iske liye jo rakam unhone maangi wo chaunkaane vaali thi
 Shariq Usmani - At least like 20 candidates
 10 se 12 karod rupaye to kam se kam kharchaa aayega hi aayega
 At least 20 candidates
 reporter-kitna ?shaarik osmani-kam se kam 10 karod maan ke chaliye aap
 Reporter-10 Lakhs? Shariq Usmani-10 Crores
 20 candidet utaarne ke liye 10 se 12 karod rupee kaa kharch
 That is, a rate of at least 50 lakh rupees for every dummy candidate
 netagiri kii har dukaan kaa rate alag he
 No one has heard the name of the party and stands to gain by standing for the candidate
 chunavi dhandhe kaa khulaa khel chal rahaa he
 The 'aaj Tak' team caught another person who was running the dummy candidates in the UP elections
 naam rajesh kumaar kushvaha, jo khud ko 'bharat rakshak kranti party' naam se ek rajnatik dal ke upaadhyaksh bataate hai
 When the dummy candidate was talked about for the UP elections, Rajesh himself agreed to become a dummy candidate
 sabase hairaan karne vaali baat ye he ki in siyaasi dukaanon kaa jaal har taraf failaa he
 They claim to put up a dummy candidate in the elections from any constituency anywhere
 'big bos' ke gharavaalon ke din kii shuruyaat film 'lakshya' ke tital song se hui
 In the morning once again, Nitibha fought with Manveer and Mona over household chores
 ghar ke captain hone ke naate manavir ne faisla kiya ki kichan main kam bartan honge to safai zyada bani rahegi
 For this, he left only eight plates and kept them in the store room, but Nitibha objected to this and brought back all the plates
 nitibha ne kaha ki unhen sabko kaam karne ke liye kanvince karnaa chahie, lekin vah sabaki taraf se faisle nahin le sakate hai
 Later, during a conversation with Manveer and Mona, Manu says that despite being a part of the reality show and industry for the last ten years, it lacks confidence and never uses its full potential
 shaam ko tikat tu phinale ke liye 'big bos' ne solar system task introdeus kiya
 For this task, a ticket to finale was kept in the garden area, around which the families had to roam like planets
 gharavaalon ko apana pani bachaate hue or dusron kaa pani giraane kii koshish karte hue chalanaa tha
 At each level, one member had to be out of the game and after each level the remaining members had to fill their respective bowls and start walking on the top orbit
 lopamudra ko ranking task main pehali rank mili thi isliye unhone duusare orbit se chalanaa shuru kiya
 For the entire season, Nominated Rohan was made the task manager
 task shuru hone ke baad kaaphi der tak chalane ke baad body pen hone kii vajah se mona task se baahar ho gayi
 In the next round, Lopamudra joined, but on arrival, he announced that the one who would drop his water would spoil his task
 kuch der baad lopa ke juute kaa les khul gaya jise baandhne kii koshish karte hue vah rukne lageen lekin manavir or manu ne kaha ki vah ruk nahin sakati hai
 Angry Lopa started walking fast and after some time she got trapped
 haalanki lopa ne apni haar ko sakaaratmak tareeke se nahin liya
 Manveer asked her that if she was not hurt, she started saying what difference it made to her
 or vah dusron ko dosha dene lageen ki les khulne par unhen baandhne nahin diya gaya isliye vah gir gayi
 She also started commenting against Bani
 agle round main nitibha phisalkar gir gayi or manu, manavir or bani hi task main batch gaye
 After this Manu and Manveer made a plan to topple Bani
 manu ne kaha ki vah bani ke peeche chalenge or unka boul gira denge
 However, 'bigg Boss' announced the end of the day of the task
 der raat teenon practice karne lage, vahiin manu ne kaha ki vah tikat tu phinale se zyada captaini ke liye mehnat kar rahe the
 In tomorrow's episode we will see that Bani will angrily throw her bowl and manu-manveer will become the contender for Ticket to Finale
 baad main manavir or mona se baatcheet ke dauraan manu kehete hai ki reality sho or industry kaa pichley das saalon se hissaa hone ke baavjood usamen confidence kii kami he or vah apane puure potential kaa istemaal kabhi nahin karti he
 In the evening, 'bigg Boss' introduced the Solar System task for Ticket to Finale
 is task ke liye garden aria main tikat tu phinale rakhaa gaya tha jiske chaaro taraf gharavaalon ko grahon kii tarah ghoomana tha
 The householders had to walk while saving their water and trying to spill water of others
 har level par ek sadsy ko game se baahar hona tha or har level ke baad baaki bache sadasyon ko apane-apane boul main pani bharkar upar vaale orbit par chalanaa shuru karnaa tha
 Lopamudra was ranked first in the ranking task so he started from the second orbit
 vahiin puure sijan ke liye nominated rohan ko task kaa sanchaalak banaaya gaya
 Mona dropped out of the task due to having a body pen after running for a long time after the task started
 agle round main lopamudra ne join kiya lekin aate hi unhone ghoshnaa kar di ki jo unka pani giraayega vah uskaa task kharaab kar dengi
 After a while, Lopa's shoe laces opened which she started trying to tie but Manveer and Manu said that she could not stop
 gusse main lopa tej chalane lageen or kuch der baad funskar gir gayi
 However, Lopa did not take his defeat in a positive way
 manavir ne unase poocha ki chot to nahin lagi to vah kehane lageen ki unhen kya fark padataa he
 And she started blaming others that she was not allowed to tie when the laces opened, so she fell
 vah bani ke khilaaf bhi coment karne lageen
 In the next round, Nitibha slipped and Manu, Manveer and Bani survived the task
 iske baad manu or manavir ne bani ko giraane kaa plan banaaya
 Manu said that he would follow Bani and drop his bowl
 haalanki 'big bos' ne task ke din kii avadhi khatm hone kii ghoshnaa kar di
 All three started practicing late at night, while Manu said that he was working hard for captaincy more than Ticket to Finale
 kal ke episod main ham dekhenge ki bani ne gusse main apana boul phenk dengi or manu-manavir tikat tu phinale ke daavedaar ban jaaenge

 Sharif told reporters during his stay in London on his way to the US to meet Obama on Wednesday, although India does not want such (third party) intervention, but world powers must join to resolve the issue
 pakistan kii sarkari samvaad samiti apipi ne navaj sharif ke hawaale se kaha, bharat or pakistan donon hi parmaanu shakti sampann hai or yah kshetra ek parmaanu takaraav kii ashanka vaala ilaaka he
 In response to a question on Kashmir, the Pakistani Prime Minister said that during his visit to the US during the Kargil conflict in July 1999, he had explicitly told US President Bill Clinton that if the US intervenes, the Kashmir issue can be resolved
 unhone kaha, maine unase kaha tha ki vah jitna samay pashchim asia mudda sulajhane par kharch kar rahe hai, uskaa 10 pratishat bhi samay den, to donon deshon ke bich kashmir kaa mudda sulajh jayega
 He said Clinton promised then, but things changed after that
 navaj sharif ne kaha, pakistan ne sanyukt raashtra mahasabha main apni chintaa (kashmir ko lekar chintaa) uthaai thi or vishwa ne isaki prashansa kii thi
 i will repeat this message once again during my official visit to America

 Sharif said that both sides have been involved in an arms race for the last 60 years
 unke hawaale se kaha gaya, sthiti khatarnaak ban sakati he
 India has an atomic bomb, we also have it, India develops missiles, we do too
 isaki ek seemaa honi chahie
 We all should consider it
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki vah obama se apni mulaakaat ke dauraan america drone hamalon kaa bhi mudda uthaaenge
 Apart from the Afghanistan issue, other major issues will be discussed during the meeting between Obama and Sharif, india-pakistan relations are expected to be included

 ’’ There are reports of differences in the Sunni Waqf Board in the Ayodhya case
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki ayodhya maamle main muslim paksh ke vakeelon ne bayaan jari kar kaha he ki hamen kisi kii bhi madhyasthata manjuur nahin he
 The lawyers said, "neither we, nor the main Hindu parties, accept arbitration

 The panel members Sriram Panchu and Zafar Farooqui seem to have a synergy
 report se sahamat nahin hum
 There is also a question on the timing of the report leaking
 " aapako bataa den ki buudhvaar ke din jab antim sunwaayee chal rahi thi ki is maamle main gathit madhyasthata samiti ne apni report supreme court ko saunp di he
 Sources said that this report said that the Muslim side has agreed to give up the claim on the disputed land and also said that the government should renovate the rest of the mosques in Ayodhya and provide land to build the mosque
 Advocate on record for Sunni Waqf Board Ejaz Maqbool in Supreme Court has issued a press release and denied reports of settlement on Ayodhya issue before the mediation panel
 Shahid Rizvi, a lawyer for the Sunni Waqf Board, also told NDTV
 unhone kaha, 'hamane madhyasthata panel ko apane vichaar die hai lekin ham adaalat main prastut kiye gaye nipataaran yojana kaa khulaasa nahin kar sakate hai
 It is positive and all people, Hindus and Muslims will be happy

 "it is believed that this report of the panel can prove to be a major link in resolving this 134 year old dispute

 If 39-year-old Krishna Kumari wins the election, she can become the first woman Hindu MP in Pakistan
 pakistan pipuls party (pipipi) ne sindh praant main thar kii rahane vaali ek hindu mahila ko seenet chunaav ke liye ummidavaar banaaya he
 The Upper House of the Parliament of Pakistan is called the Senate
 pakistan pipuls party ke soshal media team ke sadsy ayaaj bureero ne krishna kumari ke party kii ore se ummidavaar banaae jane kii pushti kii he
 Let me tell you that Muslim dominated Pakistan is considered as a conservative country
 yahaan mahilaon ko samaaj main kai str par bhedbhaav kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 Due to being an Islamic country, Hindus also face difficulties in many places
 bharat, pakistan main bacchiyon kaa yon utpeedan dardanaak: sanyukt rashtrakumari ek kohli parivaar se aati he or vah ek saamaajik kaaryakarta ke taur par apane bhai ke saath pipipi main shaamil hui thim
 He was later made president of the Union Council from Bereno
 kumari kaa janm ek garib kisaan parivaar main varsh 1979 main hua tha or unke parivaar ke sadasyon ne ek jameendaar kii ek nijee jail main kareeb teen varsh gujaarey
 According to the US report on India's contribution to Afghanistan, Kumari married Lalchand at the age of 16 and she was studying ninth grade at that time
 haalanki unhone apni padhai jari rakhi or varsh 2013 main unhone sindh vishvavidhyalay se samaaj shaastra main masters kii degree hasil kii
 The Congress and the BJP dismiss it as a wooden hand
 iske vyaavhaarik rup lene or tikne ko lekar andeh jataayaa jaataa rahaa he
 But if you talk to the leaders of regional parties, especially the 17 parties who were present on the stage at the Talkatora Stadium on Wednesday, most believe that the Third Front is an idea whose time has come to take action
 tisare morche ko khaarij karne ke peeche donon rashtriya partiyon kii apni-apni vajahen hai
 Ideally, the BJP wants it to be the only alternative to the Congress party at the Center
 party kisi anya sakasham vikalp ke ubhaar ko ek khatre kii tarah hi dekhati he jo congress virdohi voton main send laga saktaa he
 Former BJP president Venkaiah Naidu said, "this is an experiment that has failed repeatedly and it is not going to happen
" ”congress kii museebatcongress party bhi ‘tisare morche’ ko kaaphi andeh se dekhati he
 The emergence of a competent alternative makes a dent in the 'secular vote bank' of the Congress as it provides an alternative to those who are opposed to the political thinking of the BJP
 tisare morche yaa anya kisi vikalp main zyaadaatar kshetreey partiyaan hi shaamil hoti hai
 Given that the Congress is the only party with a pan-india presence, regional parties can only emerge at the expense of the Congress party
 pichley hafte lagaataar do dinon main hone vaali do ghatnaon ne vishleshkon or rajnatik jaankaron ko centre main ek gaiyr-congressi, gaiyr-bijepi gathbandhan ke sambhavit ubhaar par dhyaan dene ko majaboor kar diya he
 On Tuesday, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, while effectively interfering in a party conference in the state, unceremoniously unseated the bjp's prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi
 iske agle hi din 17 kshetreey partiyon ke netaa kai saal ke baad pehali baar ek manch par aae jisase tisare morche ke ubhaar ko hawa mili
 Such people can consider the emerging platform of regional and small parties as the competent alternative to both national parties who are not influenced by the politics of tremendous brand like Narendra Modi and corruption and inefficiency of the UPA government and the Congress party in general and especially Rahul Gandhi by Narendra Frustrated with the failure to challenge the campaign under Modi's leadership
 sah-astitv par sankatwaise tisare morche main khud ko hi nasht kar lene kii aadat he
 Keep in mind that no government of the Third Front was able to complete its tenure, due to which a big question arises about its formation and the potential for any possible experiment
 dikkat badhaane vaali baat yah bhi he ki kshetreey netaaon kii mahatvakankshaayen hiloren maarthi rahati hai
 The question of leadership is always rooted and that is why such experiments often collapsed earlier
 jepi yaa ve
 P
 singh jaisi kisi kendriya hasti ke abhaav main zyaadaatar kshetreey partiyon ke netaa khud ko sambhavit pradhanmantri ke rup main dekhte hai or yah ek sambhavit adangha he jisaki vajah se tisare morche ke aage bad paane kii sambhaavna dhoomil hoti he
 The indication of what will happen next can only be understood from the fact that a section of SP supporters present in the crowd were constantly shouting slogans about Mulayam Singh becoming Prime Minister
 isse baithak main maujuud bahut logon ko achraj hua ki aakhir tisare morche ke netaaon ne apni pichhali galatiyon se koi sabak liya he yaa nahin
 It is a fact that JD (U), SP, Left Front, Biju Janata Dal (BJD), JD (S), AIADMK, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), Jharkhand Vikas morcha-prajatantrik (JVM) and Assam Gana Parishad (AGP) ) Leaders of diverse parties came together on the stage
 gaur karne kii baat he ki inamen se chaar kshetreey partiyaan—jedy(you), eiediemke, jeviem or agypi 1998 se 2004 ke dauraan rashtriya janatantric gathbandhan (endie) kaa hissaa rahi hai or ensipi ab bhi upie kaa hissaa he
 But the absence of parties such as RJD, LJP, BSP, TMC and DMK have revealed what kind of contradictions the platform may face further
 kuch kshetreey or choti partiyaan bhi ek-duusare ko sweekaar karne vaali nahin hai
 SP and BSP cannot come together and neither DMK and AIDMK or Left Front and TMC, RJD and JD (U)
 kshetreey partiyaan yah maanati hai ki satta main aane kii yadi koi ummid rakhni he to uske liye ekmaatr rasta yahi ho saktaa he ki ve ek binar ke neeche aaen or iske alaava unako paraspar jodgaye vaali koi vichaardhaara jaisi cheez nahin he
 But in these parties, the scope of any pre-election agreement is rarely seen
 iskaa pramaan yah he ki ye partiyaan apane prabhaav vaale ilaake main duusari partiyon ke liye ek seat bhi chhodie ko taiyaar nahin hai
 This raises a serious question on their co-existence
 maukaparasti kaa mellekin secularism ke naam par ekajute huin partiyon main se kisi ne nahin kaha ki ve bijepi yaa congress vaale gathbandhan main shaamil nahin hongi
 If the political situation changes, the AIDMK and the Biju Janata Dal will have no hesitation in joining hands with the BJP despite their commitment to secularism
 isi tarah jedy (you) or jedy (es) congress se gathbandhan kar sakate hai
 Everyone knows that regional leaders are looking for opportunity and during this time they want to hide their leaves under the cover of secularism
 sambhavit tisare morche ne apni vyaavhaarikta khud hi tay kar lee he
 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar says, "as far as possible and as many parties as possible, we should stick together
 ” lekin aisa ho, iske liye prastaavit morche ke netaaon ko na keval apni mahatvakanksha par kaabo rakhana hoga balki apane antarvirodhon ko bhi sanbhaalanaa hoga
 If we look at the history, then it can be said that it is easier to say, not to do

 43 karod Nisha Priya Bhatia, a former officer of the Intelligence Agency Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), who had tried suicide in front of the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) nearly two years ago, surprised everyone by taking off her clothes in a courtroom of the Delhi High Court on Thursday
 nisha priya bhaatia kii is harakat ko dekhakar nyaayadhish ne aanan-fanan main unki maansik haalat kii jaanch karaane kaa aadesh diya
 Justice Ajit Bharihoke, while ordering a mental examination of Bhatia, said, "the petitioner's (nisha Priya Bhatia) attitude of exposing herself in open court is very regrettable and it appears that she is not mentally fit
" ’nyaayadhish ne kaha ‘yah koi akeli aisi ghatana nahin he balki dopaher ke bhojan ke baad vaale satr main bhi unhone aisa hi karne kii koshish kii thi jisaki ummid kisi saamaanya vyakti se nahin he
 After the adjournment of his case before noon, when the former RAW officer took off his jacket and stripped himself, the court ordered his detention
 adaalat ne sambandhit thane ke esechao se kaha ki unhen jaanch ke liye institute of human bihaviours and alide sciensej (iechabes) le jaaen
 Bhatia acted strangely in the courtroom when the judge adjourned the hearing on his plea
 bhaatia kii yachika atirikt mukhya metropolitan magistrate ajay pandeya or metropolitan magistrate preetam singh ke khilaaf thi
 Bhatia, once the head of raw's training wing, had filed a petition against the judges of the lower court alleging that he had tried to help her boss and former agency secretary Ashok Chaturvedi
 bhaatia ne chaturvedi par yon utpeedan kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 The woman officer alleges that former RAW chief Chaturvedi used to call her at her office and made lewd comments
 haalanki, chaturvedi ne in aaropon se inkaar kiya he
 During the day, a female lawyer came to Bhatia's rescue and pleaded to release her on the grounds that she had to take her daughter from school
 iske baad nyaayamurti bharihok ne maamle kii sunwaayee apane kaksh main karne kaa faisla kiya or kaha ‘main unhen jail bhej duungaa
 She has also caused a lot of problems in the ACMM court, i believe she is a mentally ill woman
 ’camere kii jad main ho rahi kaarywahi ke dauraan bhi jab bhaatia ne apana karnama doharaaya to adaalat ne jaanch ke liye unhen maansik aspataal bheje jane kaa faisla kiya
 The judge said that his mental status report should be submitted to the court before the hearing date of the case on February 28
 aaj se sawan kaa maheenaa shuru ho rahaa he or is maheene main shivlinga kii puja kaa vishesh mahatv he
 It is believed that in this month, the wishes of all the devotees who worship Lord Shankar and fast for him are fulfilled
 vishesh rup se avivaahit kanyaayenshivlinga kii poojichha or manachaaha var paane ke liye karti hai or is maheene main vrath bhi rakhti hai
 According to Pandit Vinod Mishra, a belief associated with the worship of Shivalinga is that women, especially virgins, should not touch Shivlinga
 yahaan tak ki shivlinga kii puja kaa khyaal karnaa bhi unke liye nishedh he
 It is believed that the lingam together represents the vagina (which symbolizes the goddess Shakti and is the creative energy of the woman)
 vinod mishra ke anusaar isliye stri ko shivlinga ke kareeb jane kii ajna nahin hoti he
 This is because Lord Shiva is absorbed in severe penance
 devon ke dev mahadev kii tandra bhang na ho jaae isliye mahilaon ko shivlinga kii puja na karne ke liye kaha gaya he
 When Shiva's sleep is disturbed, he becomes angry
 iske alaava mahilaon kashivlinga ko chhukar puujakarna maa parvati ko bhi pasand nahin he
 Maa Parvati may be angry with this and the worshiping women may have the opposite effect of such worship
 mahilaon ko shiv kii puja murti rup main kerani chahie
 Worshiping the entire Shiva family is especially beneficial for them

 17 november ko ritair ho rahe hai nyaayamurti gogoidenjhi gogoi kaa antim kaary diwas 15 november kodesh ke sambhavat: sarvaadhik charchit va vivaadit ayodhya ke ram janmabhumi-babari masjid maamle main aaj subah saadhe das baje supreme court apana faisla sunaane ja rahaa he
 After completing the hearing of the case, the country's top court reserved its decision
 tabhi se yah anumaan lagaaya ja rahaa tha ki pradhan nyaayadhish nyaayamurti ranjan gogoi ke sevanivrutt hone se pehle is maamle main faisla aa jayega
 Justice Gogoi retires on 17 November
 vaise to adaalat kisi bhi din baith sakati he, maamle ko sun sakati he or faisla de sakati he lekin phir bhi 17 november ko ravivaar he or saamanyat: itane bade maamalon main faisla avkaash ke din nahin aayaa karata
 Also, the day in which judges are retiring, decisions are not usually pronounced in big cases
 isse pehle 16 november ko shanivaar kaa bhi avkaash he
 In such a situation, the last working day of Justice Ranjan Gogoi is falling on 15 November
 isse yah anumaan lagaaya gaya ki ayodhya maamle kaa faisla nyaayamurti gogoi kii adhyakshata vaali peeth 14 yaa 15 november ko suna sakati he

 Despite this, neither the court nor the government, from any side, indicated that the verdict in the Ayodhya case could come before November 14-15
 phir achaanak, shuukravaar raat yah soochna aati he ki ayodhya maamle par faisla shanivaar subah saadhe das baje sunaaya jayega
 It is believed that this sudden announcement is part of this deliberate strategy that anti-social elements could not get a chance to prepare for any kind of crime in this very sensitive, emotion and faith related matter
 or isiilie shuukravaar kii raat elaan kiya gaya ki ek raat ke katane ke baad shanivaar kii subah hone ke saath hi maamle main faisla suna diya jayega

 aapahudarih ek ziddee ladki kii aatmakathaalekhakah ramanika guptaprakashakah samayik prakashankimtah 795 ru
 Ramanika Gupta has been in the news for the first section of her autobiography about the incident before Aphudari, which a senior litterateur called "the story of a female political activist"
 ab unhone apane jivan ke antarang prasangon ke irdagird jo kuch buna he use ek ziddee ladki kii aatmakatha kahkar aapahudari naam se prakashit kiya he
 According to the writer, your time is very long and the geography is huge
 ab ve apni umr ke 86wein varsh main hai or is pustak main unhone 1970 tak ke apane antarang kshanon kaa zikr kiya he
 At that time, his age is just 40 years
 is tarah unki umr ke lambey hisse kaa vivaran chapana baaki he jiske or dilachasp hone ke asaar hai
 Ramanika Gupta has been an activist associated with the trade union, but her life's quest was not to make her realize her presence by reaching power, but she says in her autobiography about her own aspiration, "I could tie all the boundaries now, Could break boundaries
 simaaon main rahanaa mujhe hameshaa kachotata rahaa he, seemaa todgaye kaa abhas hi mujhe atyadhik sukhakaari lagata he
 i can break taboos
 
 
 apni deh kii main khud maalik hum
 i host
 sanchalit nahin
 "in this entire autobiography, Ramanika sets out to explore the role of a stubborn girl as well as an independent expression of the woman's desire
 ve jahaan-jahaan jaati hai vahaan unke sambandh banate chalate hai—kahin bhi ve chali nahin jaatin lekin apane in sambandhon ke bare main jab ve likhti hai to purush pradhan samaaj ke tilism ko resha-resha kar daalati hai
 She expresses her experience in these words, "what is sexual devotion about society, society has decided, but it has not changed its norms with understanding
" 
 
 vyakti badalata rahaa, pyaar kii paribhaashaayen, sukh kii vyakhya, yon kaa dayera sab to deshkal ke anuroop badalata he
 Relationships are also relative
 durbhagyavash samaaj ne apana drushtikon nahin badla khaskar bhartiya samaaj ne
 "among the men of this Indian society who have a relationship with Ramanika Gupta, there is also a long list of her husband, husband's friend, leader, the leader who walks with the leader, the ordained men
 aapahudari se guzarate hue yah saaf mahasoos hota he ki sexuality kii khoj utsavdharmita main tabdeel hoti he
 There is nowhere in the entire autobiography of a woman
 jahaan haadase main boldnes ke baavjood ek raajnneeti-vimarsh bhi saath chalata he vahiin aapahudari main ramanika gupta antarangta ke vimarsh main bhinn-bhinn ayaamon kii padtaal kar stri ko apane badan kaa khudamukhtaar banane kii raah taiyaar karti hai
 This autobiography does not link to the episodes of autobiographies of women writers published in the last ten years because those authors have given their rich time to literature
 ramanika ne hindi kii seva ek saamaajik kaaryakarta kii tarah kii he lekin antat yah puri kitaab unki apni nijee-yatra he isamen samaaj kahin peeche chuta rah gaya lekin yah pathneey to he hi iske alaava ek nirbhik stri ne apane jivan kii antarangataaon ko behad bold nazariye se pesh kiya he

 The atmosphere of 2019 general elections is being created across the country
 modi sarkaar apni kalyankari yojanaon ko saamne rakh janata ko vikaas kaa saboot de rahi he to congress ne ab sarkaar ke khilaaf rafel deal ko lekar morcha khol diya he
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi has not only claimed scam in this defense deal, but also directly questioned the role of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in this deal
 congress adhyaksh ne kaha he, 'modiji ne vyaktigat rup se yah sauda karavaaya
 Modiji personally went to Paris
 vyaktigat rup se saude ko badalawaaya gaya
 The whole of India knows this
 'itnaa hi nahin, rahul ne raksha mantri nirmala sitaraman ke bayaan par bhi sawaal uthaae
 He said, 'the Defense Minister is saying that she will not inform India, the martyrs and their families about the money spent on the planes, about this deal
 iskaa kya arth he? iskaa yahi arth he ki ghotaalaa hua
 In fact, the Defense Minister has given a written reply in the Rajya Sabha in this regard that information about the deal of Rafael Fighter Plain from France cannot be made public, because the negotiations on the deal are state secrecy
 raksha mantri ke is bayaan ne congress ko haaavee hone kaa bada hathiyaar de diya he or bijepi mukhya vipakshi dal kii in daleelon par ghirti najar aa rahi he
 
 -deal kii jaankaree kyon nahin saajha kii ja rahi he?-fiter plane itane mahange daamon main kyon kharida gaya?-is saude main technology transfar kyon nahin ho rahaa he?congress kyon laga rahi ghotaale kaa aropcongress netaa gulam nabi aaazaad ne daawa kiya he ki pradhanmantri ne apni france yatra ke dauraan nirdhaarit mulyon kii andekhi kar kharid kii
 He claimed that a Rafale aircraft 1570 during Modi's rule
 8 karod rupaye main kharida gaya, jabaki upie ke dauraan is ek vimaan kii keemat par 526
 1 crore was agreed
 bharat ko mahangaa kyon?aaazaad ne ye bhi daawa kiya jis fiter plane kii deal modi sarkaar ne bharat ke liye kii he, vahi plane katar ko 694
 8 crores has been sold
 to bharat ko 100 pratishat zyada daam par kyon bechaa gaya?'kya he puraa sauda?darasal, rafel fiter plane kharidne kii prakriya congress ke netritv vaali upie sarkaar ne saal 2010 main shuru kii thi
 But the deal could not be finalized during his tenure
 saal 2014 main centre kii satta badal gai or narendra modi ke netritv main bijepi kii sarkaar bani
 On September 23, 2016, French Defense Minister Jean Evereans and India's Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar signed the Rafale Deal in Delhi
 is deal ke tahat bharat ko france se 36 rafel fiter vimaan milane hai
 However, the entire deal was 126 aircraft
 purv raksha mantri eke antni ke ek puraane bayaan ke mutabik, is saude main ye tay hua tha ki 18 jahaaj 'of da shelf' kharide jaaenge or 108 jahaaj bharat main banenge
 Now Congress is alleging that the Modi government decided to buy 36 aircraft unilaterally
 congress ne ye bhi aarope lagaaya he ki vimaan kharid main niyamon kii andekhi kii gai, yahaan tak ki cabinet kii suraksha maamalon kii samiti se purv anumati bhi nahin lee gai
 Apart from this, it has also been claimed in the media reports that the tender that came out to buy fighter planes had 6 companies
 lekin bhartiya vayusena ne rafel ko sabase behatar bataate hue usee se fital plane kharidne kaa faisla kiya
 Now the problem for BJP is that the Congress claimed that Modi personally went to Paris and he went there and personally changed the deal
 doosraa ye ki 18 ke bajaay 36 vimaan kharide ja rahe hai or is puure saude ke bare main sarkaar kii taraf se koi jaankaree nahin di ja rahi he
 Thirdly, Congress is saying that now the cost of a plane is Rs 1555 crore whereas Congress was buying this aircraft for Rs 428 crore
 is tamaam daleelon ke aadhaar par congress vimaan kharid main ghotaale kaa aarope laga rahi he
 Whatever else the bjp's UP youth unit has done to the youth in the name of meeting Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi and Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha national president Anurag Thakur, what else can be called fraud
 party ke yuva morcha kii ore se chalaae ja rahe sadsyta abhiyaan ke pehle charan main kai tarah kii khamiyaan ujagar huin, jisase yah sabit ho gaya he ki yuva morcha ati utsaah main soobe ke yuvaaon ke saath vishwasghaat kar rahaa he
 The membership campaign was launched across the country on 23 July by the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM)
 utsahit yuva morcha ne kendriya netritv dwaara die gaye 10 lakh sadsy banane ke lakshya ko badhaakar 20 lakh kar diya
 On the same day, membership campaign was also started in about 55 districts of the state including the capital, and by the evening, it was claimed that on the first day, 50 thousand members took BJP membership
 bhajayumo kii ore se kaha gaya ki pehle din lagbhag 50 hajaar logon ko bijepi kaa sadsy banaaya gaya
 On the contrary, in the membership program organized in Lucknow, hundreds of people were filled in the form but only few people got the party's official receipt (membership book)
 is sawaal par party ke padaadhikariyon ne kaha ki sadsyta shulk sirf unheen se liya gaya, jinhen bahi di gai he, to phir sawaal yah he ki jin logon se farm bharwakar rakhe gaye hai, kya ve phir paanch rupee jamaa kar bijepi kii sadsyta lene aaenge yaa bhajayumo ke utsahit yuva kaaryakarta khud hi un yuvaaon ke ghar jaakar unhen bijepi kii adhikrut bahi pakadaayenge
 The second biggest question is that the youth who have filled the forms have not received the BJP membership receipt
 aise main unhen bijepi kaa sadsy kaise mana ja saktaa he? yani hajaaron farm bina bahi die hi baant die gaye or un logon kii sankhya ko bhi jodakar dhindhora peeta gaya ki pehle din hi 50 hajaar se adhik sadsy bana liye gaye
 The question is that before starting such a big program, why was not the authorized book printed by the youth front
 yani modi or bhajayumo ke rashtriya adhyaksh anuraag thakur se milaane ke naam par yuvaaon se sirf farm bharwakar chalaa gaya
 It is worth mentioning that it has also been announced by the BJYM that the youth who will make one thousand members will be given a chance to meet Modi and the youth who will make 500 members will be reunited with Anurag Thakur
 jab sadsyta abhiyaan ke dauraan yuvaaon ko party kii adhikrut bahi hi nahin di gai, tab yah kaise tay kiya ja saktaa he ki kisne 1000 or kisne 500 sadsy banawaye
 About the membership campaign, Uttar Pradesh BJP Yuva Morcha president Ashutosh Rai said that 50,000 people were added on the first day of membership campaign
 abhi bhi log bijepi se judane ke liye utsahit hai
 When asked why the party's official receipt was not being given to the youth during the membership drive, Rai said, "the party did not expect so many people to join
" baad main bahiyaan kam pad gayi, isliye yuvaaon se sirf farm hi bharwaaye gaye
 They will be given the book later
 'raay ne haalanki yah bhi kaha ki bhajayumo kii puri koshish sabhi yuvaaon tak bahiyaan pahunchane kii rahegi
 Party state president Laxmikant Vajpayee said that the program was started by the BJYM on the direction of the central leadership
 jahaan tak baat sadsyta abhiyaan ke dauraan adhikrut raseed dene kii he to jitani adhikrut bahiyaan thim, usee ke sahare abhiyaan kii shuruyaat kar di gai
 More books will be printed soon

 jamaat-ud-daawa pramukh or lashkar sargana hafiz said ko chah maheene ke liye nazarband karne kii khabar mangalvaar ko surkhiyaan bator rahi hai
 After Hafiz was taken into custody, a video is going viral on social media in which Hafiz is seen saying that he has been arrested due to the friendship between India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Donald Trump
 
 udhar aisi atakalein bhi hai ki karrwai pakistan ne us chetavanee ke baad kii jisamen america ne kaha ki agar jamaat ud daawa ke khilaaf karrwai nahin kii gai to vah pakistan par pratibandh laga saktaa he
 It is also important to know among them that the incident of detention of Hafiz Saeed is not the first time
 isse pehle bhi samay samay par hafiz said ko house arest kiya ja chukaa he
 On 13 December 2001, Saeed was detained by the Pakistan government on charges of collusion in an attack on the Indian Parliament, and once again released on March 31, 2002, the let leader was arrested on 31 October 2002
 tippaniyan Similarly, Hafiz was detained by the Punjab province of Pakistan after the 2006 Mumbai train attack but was released a few days later on the orders of the Lahore High Court
 iske baad ek baar phir isi maamle par said ko hiraasat main lekar ek guest house main band rakhaa gaya lekin baad main adaalat ke aadesh main chhod diya gaya
 Then in December 2008, Hafiz Saeed was placed under house arrest once again when the United Nations included Saeed's so-called religious organization Jamaat Ud Dawa in the list of terrorist organizations
 bataa den ki jamaat ud daawa khud ko paropkaaree sanghathan bataati he lekin use pratibandhit lashkar e taiyaba kaa sahoyagi sanghathan bhi bataaya jaataa rahaa he
 After this, Hafiz was repeatedly released on a court order by house arrest in 2009 after India's demand for Saeed's extradition
 jahaan kaiyon ke liye hafiz ko nazarband kiya janaa trump kaa asar he, vahiin kuch log aise bhi hai jo pakistan sarkaar ke said ke khilaaf baar baar uthaae jane vaale is kadam ko ab gambhirtha se nahin lete
 As a Twitter user has written that the house arrest of Hafiz Saeed means that the chicken biryani will be brought to his house
 Hafiz Saeed house arrest simply means that chicken biryani will be home delivered to him

 trump ke aane ke hafte ke bheetar hi haafiz ko nazarband kiya gaya he
 ' inke sabake bich yah jaan lenaa bhi jaruri he ki hafiz said ko nazarband karne kii ghatana pehali baar nahin hui he
 Even before this, Hafiz Saeed has been arrested from time to time
 13 disambar 2001 ko bhartiya sansad par hamale main santh ganth ke aarope main said ko pakistan sarkaar ne hiraasat main liya tha or march 2002 main reeha karne ke baad ek baar phir 31 oktober 2002 ko lashkar sargana ko house arest kar liya gaya tha
 The comments isi tarah 2006 main mumbai train hamale ke baad pakistan ke punjab praant ne hafiz ko nazarband kar liya tha lekin kuch hi din baad lahore hoicourt ke aadesh par reeha kar diya gaya
 After this, Saeed was once again detained in a guest house on the same matter but later released in a court order
 iske baad disambar 2008 main ek baar phir hafiz said ko tab nazarband kar liya gaya jab sanyukt raashtra ne said kii tathakthith dharmik sanstha jamaat ud daawa ko aatankwaadi sanghathanon kii suchi main shaamil kiya
 Explain that the Jamaat Ud Dawa claims to be a philanthropic organization but has also been described as a cooperative organization of the banned lashkar-e-taiba
 iske baad bharat kii said ke pratyrpan kii maang ke baad 2009 main baar baar hafiz ko house arest karke, court ke aadesh par reeha kiya gaya
 While the impact of Trump's detention of Hafiz for many, there are some people who do not take this step of taking repeated steps against Saeed of Pakistan Government seriously now
 jaisaa ki ek twitor yuzar ne likhaa he ki hafiz said ko house arest karne kaa matlab he ab chikan biryani unke ghar tak pahunchaai jaaegi
 Hafiz Saeed house arrest simply means that chicken biryani will be home delivered to him
 — shalya chikitsa (@velabhai1) January 31, 2017 At the same time, there is hope in Twitter user Gabbar Singh's tweet, when reacting to the news of Hafiz's house arrest, 'america had put a reward of $ 10 million on Hafiz Saeed in 2012
hafiz Khulla obama ke puure shasankaal main haafiz khulla ghumaa
 Hafiz is under house arrest within a week of Trump's arrival
 ' Similarly, Hafiz was detained by the Punjab province of Pakistan after the 2006 Mumbai train attack but was released a few days later on the orders of the Lahore High Court
 iske baad ek baar phir isi maamle par said ko hiraasat main lekar ek guest house main band rakhaa gaya lekin baad main adaalat ke aadesh main chhod diya gaya
 Then in December 2008, Hafiz Saeed was placed under house arrest once again when the United Nations included Saeed's so-called religious organization Jamaat Ud Dawa in the list of terrorist organizations
 bataa den ki jamaat ud daawa khud ko paropkaaree sanghathan bataati he lekin use pratibandhit lashkar e taiyaba kaa sahoyagi sanghathan bhi bataaya jaataa rahaa he
 After this, Hafiz was repeatedly released on a court order by house arrest in 2009 after India's demand for Saeed's extradition
 jahaan kaiyon ke liye hafiz ko nazarband kiya janaa trump kaa asar he, vahiin kuch log aise bhi hai jo pakistan sarkaar ke said ke khilaaf baar baar uthaae jane vaale is kadam ko ab gambhirtha se nahin lete

 Have brought mangoes from there
 usne mujhase poocha ki kya main ye khaauungi? is dauraan vah mere puure badan ko sahalaane kii koshish kar rahaa tha

 jpg It has become extremely difficult for the BJP, which won seven seats in Delhi in the general election 2014, to form a government in the current Delhi Assembly
 uske mukhyamantri pad ke ummidavaar harshavardhan samet teen vidhayak loksabhaa kaa chunaav jitkar saansad ban gaye hai
 In such a situation, bjp's math has reduced from 32 to 29 in the 70-member assembly
 aise main samajha ja rahaa he ki saamaajik kaaryakarta or purv ipies adhikari kiran bedi dilli main bijepi kaa cheharaa ho sakati hai
 After the three seats are vacant, at least 34 mlas will be required even before the by-election to form the government
 yani bijepi ko paanch vidhayak or jutaney honge
 While there are 28 mlas of the Aam Aadmi Party and 8 of the Congress in the current assembly
 aise main bijepi ko agar anya do vidhayakon kaa samarthan mil jaataa he, to bhi party bahumat ke aankade kaa jugad nahin kar paa rahi
 In such a situation, the BJP hopes for a possible break in the Aam Aadmi Party
 agar aisa nahin hota he, to bijepi nae sire se vidhansabha chunaav karaane par jor degi, kyonki taaja modi lahar main use aasaani se bahumat miltaa dikh rahaa he
 But in such a situation, it is not easy for the BJP to decide who will be the chief ministerial candidate
 agar harshavardhan ko phir se laayaa jaataa he, to bijepi ko chandani chowk loksabhaa seat se upachunaav ke liye ek nayaa cheharaa dhundhna hoga, jo congress or AAP ko haraane kii kshamta rakhata ho
 If Harsh Vardhan is given responsibility in the central government, then according to sources, there may be an attempt to re-connect Kiran Bedi with BJP
 khud bedi chunaav nateezon or modi lahar ko dekhte hue aise kisi prastaav ko khaarij karne ke bajaae sochane ke liye taiyaar hone kaa bayaan diya he
 Monday is the last day of the latest round of talks between the leaders of the Center and Telangana on the issue of separate state and all eyes are on whether there is any agreement between the two sides
 is silsile main praja rajyam party ke mukhiya or film star chiranjeevi somvaar ko pranab mukherjee se milane vaale hai
 On Sunday, Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Kiran Reddy held a meeting with Pranab Mukherjee to discuss various options to resolve the Telangana issue
 baad main unhone kaha ki jald hi koi aisa hal nikal aayega jisase telugana ke logon kii icchhaaen puri hon
 Meanwhile, Telangana Rashtra Samithi chairman Chandrashekhar Rao has expressed hope that the decision will be in favor of Telangana state
 saath hi unhone chetavanee dete hue ki agar kendra ne is mudde ko dabaane kii koshish kii to wo phir se bhukh hadtaal par baith jaaenge
 a woman judge who was a victim of a gang of gangs, carrying a bag from a car by pointing a thug, recovered a crooked bag, Police Sikh Court's Additional Sessions Judge Neera Bharihok in Delhi's Okhla area in search of miscreants succumbed to the gang
 ve 24 sitambar ko okhla ilaake main andar basti main kisi kaam se gai thim, tabhithak-thak gangke badmaashon ne car panchar or sheesha tuutane kaa jhootha ishaara kar unka bag nikaal liya
 The accused chased them for two kilometers
 is babat okhla thane main cese darj kiya gaya he or aropiyon kii talash kii ja rahi he
 On September 24, the woman Additional Sessions Judge of Saket Court went to Okhla area for some work, according to a false puncture of car puncture and glass breakdown
 isi dauraan thak-thak gang ke do badmaashon ne mahila ko car panchar or sheesha tuutane kaa jhootha ishaara kiya
 As the car stopped, the miscreants took away their bags
 police ke mutabik, aaropee kareeb 2 kilometre dur se hi mahila kaa peechha kar rahe the
 On getting the information, Okhla police station conducted a search operation
 isi bich mahila jaj kaa bag baraamad kar liya gaya
 500 rupees were missing from the bag
 philhal police aropiyon kii talash main juty he
 Significantly, in the capital Delhi, the terror of the gangs is constantly increasing
 is gang ke sadsy chaar pahiyaa vaahanon par savaar logon ko shikaar banaate hai
 It is difficult to identify the members of this gang because of their appearance like normal people
 bhaajapa ne rajya ke chunaavon main kisi netaa kaa naam ghoshit nahin karne kii apni panrapara se hatate hue assam vidhansabha chunaavon ke liye kendriya mantri sarvanand sonoval ko apana mukhyamantri pad kaa daavedaar ghoshit kiya
 BJP General Secretary J
 pi
 Nadda told reporters that the BJP Parliamentary Board took this decision in an hour-long meeting in which Prime Minister Narendra Modi and party president Amit Shah were also involved
 party ke rashtriya sachiv shrikant sharma ke saath nadda ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘assam kii janata sarvanand sonoval ko rashtriya nayak ke taur par jaanati he
 The parliamentary board has decided that the party will contest Assam elections under his leadership
 bhaajapa assam main apni sarkaar banane ja rahi he
 'this decision shows a strategic shift in the party's traditional way of contesting the state assembly elections by ignoring the state leadership and focusing more on the central leaders
 bihar chunaavon main party kii haar ke liye isi tareeke ko jimmedaar tehraaya gaya tha
 Apart from declaring Kiran Bedi as the chief ministerial contender at the last minute in the Delhi Assembly elections, the BJP has not announced a leader's name for the state assembly elections in the last few years, instead seeking votes in Modi's name
 jab nadda se poocha gaya ki kya party anya chunaav vaale rajyon main bhi mukhyamantri pad ke ummidavaar kaa naam ghoshit karegi to unhone kaha ki is mudde par vichaar nahin kiya gaya or baad main nirnay liya jayega
 Sonowal, 53, is currently the Union Minister for Sports and Youth Affairs (independent Charge)
 sonoval 2011 main bhaajapa main shaamil hone se pehle ol assam students union ke adhyaksh the or agypi ke netaa the
 He was made the president of the Assam BJP in November
 agle kuch maheenon main jin paanch rajyon main chunaav hone hai, unamem se assam se bhaajapa ko sabase zyada ummiden hai jahaan 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaavon ke dauraan vah sabase badi party ke taur par ubhari
 At the meeting, the Modi-led board congratulated Shah on re-elected party president
 pradhanmantri ne ummid jataai ki vah party ko bhavishya main or safaltaaen dilaayenge
 The comments sonoval ke naam kii ghoshnaa se pehle guuruuvaar ko din main pradesh ke prachaar-abhiyaan main shaamil rahe bhaajapa netaaon kii baithak hui
 a similar meeting was held in West Bengal with the leaders handling the campaign
 shah ne donon baithkon kii adhyakshata kii jinamein chunavi ranneeti par vichaar-vimarsh kiya gaya
 Nadda said, 'BJP will contest all the state assembly elections with full power and will emerge strong in a comprehensive manner
 bhaajapa assam main apni sarkaar banane ja rahi he
 The board meeting was attended by Modi, Shah and Nadda along with Union ministers Rajnath Singh, Arun Jaitley, Sushma Swaraj, Nitin Gadkari, m Venkaiah Naidu, Ananth Kumar, and all the board members
 party ke rashtriya sachiv shrikant sharma ke saath nadda ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘assam kii janata sarvanand sonoval ko rashtriya nayak ke taur par jaanati he
