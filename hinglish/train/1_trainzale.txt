 Indicating that rules should be framed soon for media coverage of terrorism related incidents, Union Information and Broadcasting Minister Arun Jaitley today said that the government is seriously considering the issue
 pratham nyaayamurti jees verma smriti vyaakhyaan dete hue jetali ne yah bhi kaha ki media sansthaanon par pabandi kaa samay nahin rahaa he or praudyogiki ke chalate sensorship asambhav ho gai he
 However, he also said that the manner in which the counter-terrorism operations of the security agencies are covered is currently an important subject in terms of media responsibility
 jetali ne kaha ki sawaal yah uthta he ki media ko sidhe maukey par jane kii anumati honi chahie yaa kuch pratibandh hone chahie
 According to the Information and Broadcasting Minister, the intelligence agencies claimed that their media coverage helped the attackers' bosses during the 26 / 11 terror attacks in Mumbai and kept them informed about what the security agencies were doing 
 jetali ne kaha, 'hamaari suraksha agenciyon or raksha mantralay kaa spasht mat he ki isaki anumati nahin di ja sakati
 And so the time when the security operation is going on, very strict discipline will have to be maintained on the way of reporting from the spot within a limited period of time
 ' unhone kaha, 'is mudde par sarkaar gambhirtha se or bahut aage kii soch ke saath vichaar kar rahi he
 ' unhone yah bhi kaha ki paramparaagat tareeke se jahaan sochaa jaataa he ki kisi akhbaar yaa channel par pabandi lagaai ja sakati he lekin sachaai yah he ki pratibandh ke din lad gaye hai
 Now it is very difficult to pressure the media institutions by refusing to advertise
 sensorship kii sambhaavna ke sambandh main jetali ne kaha ki praudyogiki ne ise asambhav kar diya he
 He said, 'suppose today that even if emergency is imposed under Article 352 of the Constitution, the effect of censorship will be zero

 Jaitley also referred to a rule in which TV channels are not allowed to show advertisements beyond 12 minutes
 unhone kaha ki kya sarkaar ko akhabaaron or channelon ko bataanaa chahie ki kitne vigyaapan or kitni khabaren dikhaai jaaen
 The Information and Broadcasting Minister said, "the government's interference in how much news is shown and how many advertisements is a bad example from my personal view
 ' On another important issue, the minister said that the issue of cross-holdings in the media, or those who invest in media, need to be debated on the issue of business
 unhone kaha ki anek deshon main is vishay par kanoon hai lekin bharat main nahin
 He said that in the media, the time has come to debate in judicial circles so that Indian society can form a mature opinion on the subject
 iske alaava jetali ne kaha ki media ko bade maamalon or adaalat main vichaaradhin maamalon main reporting karte samay niztaa kaa dhyaan rakhane jaise muddon par bhi vichaar karnaa chahie
 He said that there are not many external threats before the media but there are challenges within it which are related to quality, reliability and being competitive and fair

 Excerpt: Raj Chengappa: This will be your first visit to India as Head of Government
 pehle aap banker ke taur par vahaan gaye hai
 What impressed your mind about this country? Emanuel Macro: This is my first visit as President and i am very happy that i am coming to visit your country
 june (2017) main jab pradhanmantri modi paris aae the, tab iskaa nyauta unhone mujhe diya tha
 We had a wonderful meeting, a fantastic and very friendly conversation and they told me - come to India
 to ab main aa rahaa hum
 But i remember my first visit as a banker and i was very impressed by the energy of the people, especially in Bangalore and i remember many young and talented people especially in tech companies
 vah bahut, bahut asardaar he or mere saath (is yatra ke dauraan) bahut saare french siio or french start-ap bhi aaenge, jo bhartiya starop or antrapriner ke saath roj-ba-roj kaam kar rahe hai yaa unke pramukh employr main se ek bharat main hai
 So i mean that our youth and spouses are the links between us
 raaj chengappah aapane pradhanmantri modi kaa zikr kiya or aap donon kii umr main koi 27 saal kaa fark he
 Nevertheless, when you met him for the first time in this office in June 2017, it seemed that both of you had a good time
 modi ke saath aapaki chemistry kisi he?macrothmain samajhataa hum ki agar aap ek hi peedi ke na hon, tab bhi aapke bich chemistry ho sakati he or meri nijee jindagi shaayad is kism kii chemistry ke sabase achche udaahranon main se ek he
 i was deeply impressed by Prime Minister Modi's vision, especially his strong commitment to climate (reversing change), and a part of this agenda that we will pursue together in India, especially through the International Solar Alliance
 magar main samajhataa hum ki chemistry is tathy kii vajah se he ki ve bahut budhimaan shaks hai or unka nijee falsafa or swadhinata ke prati jhukaav he
 And they are deeply connected to the sovereignty of your country, just as i am connected to the sovereignty of my country
 main samajhataa hum ki isamen alag-alag samskritiyon or sabhyataa kii nijee prishthbhumiyon kaa mail he, par siyaasi falsafe ke lihaaj se kuch saajha khubiyaan or saajha ahm baaten bhi hai—samprabhutaa, vaishvik mudde, jalwaayu or yuvaaon ke prati yah majboot patibaddhta
 Raj Chengappa: France and India are partners in the International Solar Alliance (ISA)
 magar raashtrapati (donald) trump ke kaman sanbhaalane ke fouran baad unhone tay kiya ki america 2015 ke paris jalwaayu parivartan samjhauta kaa hissaa nahin rahegaa
 Although at that time you used brilliant words and said, "let's make our planet great once again", but isn't this a very serious blow? Macro: i understand that it's a very serious setback for the US federal government , But not for America itself
 mere liye nijee kshetra, america rajya jalwaayu parivartan ke khilaaf is ladaai ke saath gaharaai se patibaddh hai
 That is why i am very hopeful about this common battle and what we can implement, because i believe that America will have to rejoin this club at some point or the other
 magar raashtrapati trump ke elaan ke fouran baad yah behad jaruri tha ki paris samjhaute kii ruparekha ko bachaakar rakhaa jaae
 And in this context, the words of commitment from Prime Minister Modi were very important to me when he came to Paris in June last year
 duusari baat is agenda ke anuroop kaam ko anjaam dena he, kyonki bahut saare deshon ne is agenda ke liye apane samarthan kaa elaan kiya he, par unhone apane-apane ilaakon main khud apane liye silsilewar kaary yojanaon ko anjaam nahin diya he
 That is why i organized the One Planet Summit in Paris in December (2017) to build concrete projects on the ground and arrange the funds to fulfill these 12 commitments
 maine in patibaddhtaon ke amal par bahut baarik najar rakhi he or iskaa ek hissaa antarrashtriya saura gathbandhan bhi he
 Raj Chengappa: The ISA is expected to raise $ 1 trillion separately
 kya yah rakam ham juta paaenge? aap ise kaise sunishchit karenge?macrothrakam hamen jarur milegi, kyonki kai deshon ne hamase vaayada kiya he, or keemat ko lekar sab saath milakar kaam kar rahe hai
 If you look at today's price, there has been a huge reduction in the amount of subsidy so that competitive energy can be obtained through solar energy
 yah bada mauka he, kyonki vikaas ke lihaaj se lambii chalaang lagane or na keval africa ke liye balki kai or ilaakon ke liye vikaas kaa tikaoo model hasil karne kaa yahi sabase acha tarika he
 This is a tremendous opportunity for India
 pradhanmantri modi ke saath ham banaras jaaenge or ek badi pariyojna kaa udghaatan karenge jisamen bhartiya or french khilaadi shaamil hai
 One of the key challenges for the International Solar Alliance is to arrange funds first
 iskaa mujhe puraa bharosa he kyonki kai saare desh hamaare saath hai or kyonki ham saath milakar sambhaal lenge, lambey vakt ke dheron niveshkon ko aakarshith karne kii hamaari patibaddhta kii badaulat aisa hoga
 Secondly, we have a list of important and reliable projects
 is conference kii taiyaari karte hue hamane jo homework kiya he or iske baad jo kaam ham karenge, (vah yah he ki) thos pariyojnaon kii ek fehrist banaaenge taaki aakraamak tareeke se unhen puraa kar saken
 People need proof
 hamen nattejey chahie
 We have to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and we have to develop this new type of energy, especially renewable energy, through this solar energy initiative
 raaj chengappah doosraa hissaa bharat kii aapaki ahm dwipaksheeya yatra kaa he
 One of the things that you and PM Modi have discussed is deepening of strategic relationships
 maikron kii vah koun-si chhap he jo aap dilli main utarane par chhodia chahenge?macrothmain chahta hum ki bharat is ilaake main suraksha ke lihaaj se ek ahm or bharosemand bhagidaar ho taaki ham vah hasil kar saken jise main samprabhutaa kii aazaadee kahata hum
 i think we have a big challenge, and that is to protect your sovereignty in the Indian Ocean / Pacific Ocean region
 apane bhugol ke jariye ham is ilaake kaa hissaa hai
 Many people ignore it
 magar ham mahaj ek europea takat nahin hai
 We are also part of the forces of the Indian Ocean / Pacific Ocean region through Réunion Island and an island in the Pacific and for me it is very important to be part of this partnership in terms of collective security
 sagar main maujuudagi or asar ke lihaaj se ham duusari badi vaishvik takat hai
 We are a strong maritime force, we have a large navy equipped with numerous nuclear submarines
 ham is samuhik suraksha ko mahfuj rakhane kii khatir is ilaake main vibhinn mishnon ke jariye behad sakriy hai
 And for me, India is a trusted partner to maintain stability in this entire region, to avoid any domination and to safeguard the sovereignty of its partners
 samuhik suraksha or is dotarafa agenda kii baat karen, saath hi aatankwaad-virdohi or tamaam kism ke aatankwaad kii, khaskar seemaa paar aatankwaad kii baat karen, to ham donon ne hi pichley saal aatankwaad ke alag-alag roopon kaa saamana kiya he or hamaare saajha aadan-pradaan, hamaari khufia sevaaon ke bich kii kadigoon ko majboot karne ke liye najadik se (milakar) kaam karnaa behad jaruri he taaki ham apane logon kii hifaazat kar saken
 Raj Chengappa: i am glad you mentioned terrorism because it is a matter of deep concern for both countries
 ham donon hi hamalon ke shikaar rahe hai
 What common initiatives can we take, especially with countries that support terror, such as Pakistan? Macro: We have always discharged our responsibilities
 yahaan tak ki pehle bhi jab bharat par hamale hue yaa jab vah ilaake main mushkil halaat main tha, hamane uskaa samarthan kiya tha or ham isi niti par chalanaa jari rakhenge
 What we need to do now is to increase two-way cooperation in terms of security, good practices and exchange of information
 aapke liye ek khatra iraq-syria ilaake se jihadiyon kaa waapas lautnaa hoga
 One of our main shared interests is cooperation in this area
 unhone france par kai baar hamalaa kiya or ab ve waapas lautne or aapke ilaake main panaah lene kaa faisla karenge
 Very solid cooperation is very important and important in terms of sharing intelligence, enhancing anti-terrorist cooperation
 mere liye yah ek ranneetik bhagidaari he
 If we want to increase it, give it a new face, then we have to think about the whole area, the area of the indian-pacific Ocean, and think how the balance can be maintained in this entire area
 raaj chengappah bharat or france ke bich ek duusare ke nausainik addon tak pahunch hasil karne ko lekar kuch baatcheet hui he, jisko lekar ek samjhaute par dastakhat bhi hone hai
 Do you think this will happen during this visit - modi-macro Maritime Agreement? Macro: Definitely
 aapke paas hamaari kuch companiyon se judi alag-alag pariyojnaayen hai
 But you need a common two-way structure, a framework from government to government
 hamaari companiyon ko iskaa hissaa hona hoga, par keval kai hisson main ek hisse ke taur par hi
 i have seen all the debate going on in your country about Rafael
 magar main aapke logon se chahta hum ki ve yah baat dimag main rakhen ki yah kahin zyada ranneetik or ahm saajha dhaanche kaa mahaj ek tukdaa he, or vah zyada ahm he ki ilaake main sthirataa ko kaise banaae rakhaa jaae
 Because we are two big forces of the area and we have to maintain stability and freedom of access and avoid any domination of any one in the area
 or yah behad ahm he kyonki yah samuhik sthirataa kaa hissaa he
 i think it is part of the Indian DNA
 main bhartiya samskruti kaa bada mureed hum or main is baat se hameshaa prabhavit rahaa hum ki aap, sadi-dar-sadi, jise main kahuunga, ek kism kii asthir sthirataa, use mahfuj rakh sake hai
 It is very difficult for the French people to understand this because we love classical gardens where everything is neatly decorated in neat beds
 aapaki samskruti ghumaavon or is asthir sthirataa se zyada bani he
 It is very effective, it is part of your DNA and your strength, (it) is the ability (which) always maintains all balance from within to outside
 or main jaanata hum ki is ilaake main yah kabhi-kabhi kitna mushkil hota he, kyonki bahut saare log kinhin takaton ke dabadabe se darate hai, (unamem) hamale ke aage kamjor hone kaa ehsaas hota he
 And that is why i want France to become India's partner in this fight against terrorism
 par saath hi mere liye ek ahm baat yah bhi he ki aap apane is diene ko banaae rakhen, samaveshipan or santulan kii taraf is jhukaav ko banaae rakhen
 For your originality in this area, it is very important for the global environment
 aapke saamne is duniya main itane saare jokhim hai, itani sari anischitataayen hai, itani sari badi takatein ek duusare par hamalaa karne kii or vaishvik dhaanche ko todane kii koshish kar rahi hai
 You need a mindset in which people are able to maintain balance, avoid one's domination and violence and look for inclusive political and cultural solutions
 raaj chengappah rafel sauda bharat main vivaad kaa vishay ban gaya he
 The opposition party Congress is saying that India gave too much money, that they had bargained better by bargaining in their time
 sachaai kya he?macrothmain iskaa hissaa nahin tha, par mujhe kahana hoga ki molbhav ham sabake liye phydemand the
 The Government of India negotiated very well
 unhone bharat ke audyogic hiton kii hifaazat kii
 a large part of the production work will now take place in India, so your Prime Minister has protected the interests of industry and workers very well
 or suraksha ke nazariye se shandaar sauda aapke haath laga he, kyonki rafel is shrenee kaa behtareen vimaan he or maujuuda maahaul main mahfuj rahane kaa yah sabase acha tarika he
 As far as France is concerned, it was very good because India is a great possibility in India and because it is a part of the shared consensus between us
 loktantr main sarkaar or vipaksh ke bich beshak hameshaa vaad-vivaad honge hi
 i am not a part of the domestic political life of India, but i understand that your government has protected the interests of our country very well, not only from the economic and industrial perspective but also from the strategic point of view
 raaj chengappah saude ke byore kyon ujagar nahin kiye ja sakate or aaropon ko chautarafa mandaraate rahane dene kii bajaae andeh dur kyon nahin kiye ja sakate?macroh sabase pehle to ye vanijyik samjhaute hai or jahiraa taur par pratispardhi hai, jinhen ham saude ke byore nahin jaanane de sakate
 In India and in France, when the deal is very sensitive, we cannot reveal the details for business reasons
 kuch takneekee muddon par jawaab nadaarad hone kii kuch vajah ye vyavsaayik samjhaute or vibhinn companiyon ke hit hai
 Secondly, the Government of India has to hold some discussions and they have to consider what details they would like to reveal to the Opposition and Parliament
 main unamem se nahin hum jo in charchaaon main dakhal de or aapako yah baat jarur samajni chahie ki hamen vyavsaayik samvedansheeltaa par vichaar karnaa padataa he
 Raj Chengappa: China has started the One Belt One Road (OBOR) scheme and you used the word bigot
 obioar ko lekar bharat kii apni chintaaen hai
 In your opinion what should China do to address these concerns and address them? Macro: Negotiate with India
 main is saal kii shuruyaat main china gaya tha or main samajhataa hum ki aaj china majboot ranneetik or vaishvik nazariye se las bahut badi takat he
 This road has never been a one-way street, but one of trade and balance roads between different countries
 agar obioar pahal ko kaamyaab hona he, to jahaan iskaa vistaar kiya janaa he, us ilaake ke tamaam deshon ke saath ise zyada samaveshi or santulit hona hoga
 OBOR must match global commitments and become green
 kyonki vahaan maine apane jin gahare vishwaason kii baat kii, unamem se ek yah tha ki aap paris samjhaute kaa hissaa banane ke baad yah nahin kah sakate hai ki aap un deshon main se kuch main koyale ke kaarkaane kholenge jahaan yah sadak jaaegi
 i understand how this initiative can be considered a threat from India's perspective
 sabase acha jawaab yahi hoga ki kuch alahada peshkash kii jaae
 Suppose, okay, we need to develop the entire region up to Africa
 hamen zyada vyapaar, zyada aarthik akhandta, zyada aadan-pradaan kii darkaar he, hamen apane logon ko behatar talim dene kii jarurat he
 So we can be a part of it because it is for common good, but let's talk about our role in this game, being part of the whole plan
 agar yah mahaj varchasv kaayam karne kii yojana he, to yah kabhi paravaan nahin chadhegi
 If this is the case then you have reason to fear
 magar ise bahut majboot bhu-rajnatik vijan ke taur par lijie, to bhi ise bahut vikasman banaaie or hamaare saajha lakshyon se mail khaane vaala banaaie
 Raj Chengappa: One thing on the agenda of your visit to India is to increase two-way trade
 pichley saal hamane 10 arab dollar kaa kaarobaar kiya, jo kaaphi asardaar mana gaya
 Will you set goals in this journey and what do you think needs to be done to achieve them? Macro: We can do a lot more and i will try to set a goal
 magar is yatra main mere teen mukhya uddeshy hai
 Climate, which has both two-pronged and global objectives, is the overall collective framework for security and the region
 yuvaaon kii baat bhi mere man main bahut zyada he, yuvatiyon ko talim dena or zyada se zyada aadan-pradaan karnaa
 If we work according to these things, i am sure that business will grow
 is gatividhi ke swaabhaavik nattejey ke taur par main lakshya tay karne kii koshish karuunga, par main pradhanmantri modi ke saath inaki vishwasaneeyata ke bare main tasdik bhi karnaa chaahunga
 Because if i set goals, i also want to meet them
 sahi niveshon, vyapaar or ek duusare ke liye apane bazaaron ko kholane ke lihaaj se bhi ham bahut kuch kar sakate hai
 But for me the exchange of people is very important and important with the aim of increasing business
 aapkaa paaramparik aitihaasik saajhedaar hameshaa britain tha or main chahta hum ki ab france nayaa saajhedaar ho, 21veen sadi kaa aisa saajhedaar jiskaa hawala diya jaae
 Because i think India will have to work more with Europe and the European Union overall
 uske liye main chahta hum ki france europe main bharat kaa praveshdwar bane
 This will be the foundation of strategic relationships
 main chahta hum ki aapaki srujanatkamata, aapke yuva, aapaki udhyamita france main or zyada maujuud ho, or zyada pahachaani jaae, or main france kii taraf se bhi yahi cheez chahta hum
 a few days ago, i met a lot of designers, creators for Fashion Week
 
 
 main kahuunga ki is kaarobaar ke jeniyas logon ko bulaayaa tha
 Many Indian initiators were also present in them, they were very influential and they would be part of my journey
 raaj chengappah mujhe yakeen he ki ek baat ko lekar aap jarur chintit honge or vah he pariyojnaon main hone vaali deree, khaskar raksha pariyojnaon main
 Are French businessmen worried about our way of working, especially of the Ministry of Defense? Macro: i am a very practical person
 agar mere paas koi prastaav aata he to main use sidhe mantri yaa pradhanmantri ke paas le jaaoongaa
 i will not go through the media, because this is not a good way to work
 main samajhataa hum ki ham bahut kuch kar sakate hai
 Many can fix rules, simplify their bilateral ways, minimize bureaucratic processes and reduce the complexity of relationships
 yah logon kii bhagidaari ke madhyam se ho saktaa he
 i want more and more artists to come to France, more and more chefs go to India and develop our cooking
 main chahta hum ki takneekee vaale or shastreey, donon hi udyogon main korporate aaen, choti-choti sevaaon main unki bhagidaari ho, ve chote or smart city dizin karen
 i would like your designers, articles and researchers to come to France in greater numbers
 main chahta hum ki 2020 tak france main bhartiya chaatr-chaatraon kii sankhya doguni ho jaae
 It is not a good thing that the number of Indian students in France is very less
 aapkaa purana sambandh britain se rahaa he
 i want your young students to come to France
 france main kaaphi khulaapan he
 It is part of the European Union
 aapke chaatr angreji bolte hai, yahaan aapako kai bhashaaon kaa maahaul milegaa
 Most of your students speak English fluently
 hamaare vishvavidhyalayon or grad skulon main aap angreji ke madhyam se padhai kar sakate hai
 It is a city of creativity and entrepreneurship
 main chahta hum ki paris or france aapke chaatro ke liye europe or yahaan tak ki america tak pahunchane kaa ek nayaa centre bane
 i want to develop these things because this is the best way to grow the business
 abhi yah vyapaar sambandh raksha ke kshetra main sarkaar se sarkaar ke bich baatcheet ke kaaran he
 This is right
 par takneekee or rachanaatmakataa ke kshetra main nayaa vyapaar udhyamiyon or logon ke bich aapasi sambandhon ke kaaran ho rahaa he
 Raj Chengappa: You are indeed a great ambassador of France
 doosraa mudda europe he
 You said that Europe is making a comeback despite Breguit
 aap italy main anishchit chunaav nattejey dekh chuke hai
 Why are you so optimistic about Europe and the entire union? Macro: i am not only optimistic
 main drudh bhi hum
 i have a strong desire to do something
 vakt daud rahaa he or aapako teji se kaam karnaa hoga
 The Chancellor has secured an alliance after the recent elections in Germany
 duusari taraf italy main jan adhikaarwaad teji se badha he
 People in France have decided the opposite
 unhone khulaapan, aadhuniktaa or desh main kayapalat ko pasand kiya he
 i have two objectives
 ek he france main parivartan laakar use zyada aakarshak, khulaa or majboot desh bananaa
 We have made so many improvements in the last seven months like never before
 yah kargar bhi rahaa he
 People will see its results in the coming years
 abhi iske bare main andaja nahin lagaaya ja saktaa he kyonki nattejey milane main samay lagata he
 But we have made necessary corrections
 hamen pehle se kahin majboot or sangathit europe kii jarurat he, ek aisa europe jo suraksha detaa he, shikshit karata he or pehle se kahin zyada nivesh karata he taaki vah vaishvik str par america, china or kuch swaabhaavik sahyogi deshon jaise bharat ke saath kadam se kadam milakar chal sake
 If the leaders of Europe are not yet in a position to decide immediately and speed up, they can destroy the European plan or put it in danger
 main puri tarah us par dhyaan kendrit kar rahaa hum or chahta hum ki ham pehle se kahin zyada sakasham bane
 Raj Chengappa: Globalization is facing another hit, and that is President Donald Trump's decision to take a protectionist step
 ve ek tarah se vaishvikaran ke prayaas ko nasht kar rahe hai
 How will this affect your dreams and plans in Europe
 macrothmain samajhataa hum ki yah ek baari galati he, yah vaishvik vyapaar vaataavaran ko nuksaan pahunchane jaisaa he
 The US had a major role in the policy of drafting the WTO, and (new steps) would result in reduced opportunities and a situation of trade war between countries
 isliye ham ise rokane kaa prayaas karenge
 i hope we will succeed in this but nobody knows when charges will be levied on a unilateral basis, we have to protect ourselves against dumping
 agar koi mahashakti vaishvik sandhiyon ke vipareet kisi kaaran ke bina shulk lagaataa he to yah bahut badi galati he
 i will do my best to convince President Trump — we must save our shared global structure
 raaj chengappah pradhanmantri narendra modi vaishvikaran ke bahut bade samarthak hai
 You have been talking to them
 macrothmain june (2017) main pradhanmantri modi se baat kar chukaa hum
 i heard his speech a few weeks ago in Davos
 ve hameshaa se is bare main ekadam spasht rahe hai ki ve hamaare vaishvik or vyapaar niyamon kaa puraa sammaan karte hai kyonki unhen isamen phayda najar aata he
 We must protect our people and our businesses with firmness, openness and clear rules, not by violating our own rules
 raaj chengappah main kuch nijee sawaalon ke saath ise samaapt karnaa chahta hum
 
 
 What is your favorite Indian dish
 maikron dish to nahin?macrothmain pradhanmantri modi kii salaah maanoonga, lekin tandoori chikan mujhe bahut pasand he
 i love it here
 raaj chengappah meraa aakhri sawaal he ki france ke itihaas main sabase kam umr kaa raashtrapati hone ke kya phaayde or nuksaan hai?macrosemere liye jitna phayda he, utana nuksaan bhi
 i have no right to compromise
 phaayde kii baat yah he ki jab aap yuva hote hai to aap bahadur, aksar saahsee or logon ke liye kathor hote hai kyonki aap bada sudhaar karnaa chaahate hai
 There is an energy inside you to do all this
 par jab aap yuva hote hai to ummid kii jaati he ki aap logon kii lambey samay tak seva karenge or aapako kam samay tak kaam karne kii chhot nahin milti he
 Both benefits and losses are related to energy: When you know that you are going to work for your people for decades, this feeling drives you to destroy them so that you can transform the country and take decisions that Even if it seems complicated in the short term, because you know that you are going to serve people for a long time
 main samajhataa hum ki mere desh ko isi kii jarurat he—dirghakaalik faisle
 France is a unique country
 hamaare yahaan kai krantiyaan ho chuki hai
 We are determined to achieve our objectives
 ham bahut teji se badlaav karne main bhi sakasham hai
 Our intention is to become one of the global leaders so that we can pursue our deepest values
 yah hamaara diene he

 a post shared bysara khan (@ssarakhan) onoct 24, 2018 at 10:54 pm PDT Sara said in the video, "I am making these videos because i want to tell you that my younger sister whom i love the most 
 
 
 jitne bhi log mere aas paas hai wo jaanate hai wo mere liye kya myne rakhti he
 i kept her like my daughter
 lekin ab maine use anfolo kar diya he or uski sari tasveeron ko delit kar diya he
 "people are talking a lot of things," says Sara
 sab kuch galat he
 This is the truth that i am going to tell you
 wo 18 saal kii he or itani maior he ki apana khyal rakh sake
 She does not want anyone to say anything to her, it is not wrong because she is matured
 main ab koi nahin hoti ki use ye kahuun kii wo kya kare or kya nahin
 i wanted to be her mother and control her
 ab usne mujhe chhod diya he or achche ke liye choda he
 "sara said," i was just trying to be a good sister because i didn't want to repeat the mistakes i made
 main chaahati thi ki wo doston ko parakhe or sahi galat samajhe
 Maybe my method was not right but my intension was right
 usne mujhe chhod diya or maine use jane diya
 So if you hear something that happened between us, then it is all nonsense
 sach ye he ki wo badi ho chuki he or khud ko sambhaal sakati he

 The DCP said that the accused said that he chased the robbers up to 100 meters, they turned towards GT Karnal Road
 usne kaha ki badmaashon kaa peechha karte samay uski motorcycle main kuch kharabi aa gai or vah use thik karaane mistre ke paas le gaya

 He coined a false story with his friend Raghav
 raghav ko bhi dhan kii jarurat thi kyonki usne apane nivas sthaan bulandshahr ke chandok jile main kisi se karj le rakhaa tha

 vivekanand tiwari ne aajtak
 Talking on the phone, in why he went to the High Court
 unhone kaha,‘maan lijie kisi vishvavidhyalay main 10 vibhaag hai, unamem se prayek main 5-5 siten rikt hai to sabko milakar vishvavidhyalay ko unit maanakar niyuktiyaan hoti thim

 lekin karypalika main baithe logon kii manamaani karne kaa dosha sarkaar yaa supreme court par nahin madh sakate hai
 Reservation is not bad, but it is not implemented properly at the executive level
 beuroperesi main baithe log, vishvavidhyalayon ke kulapati or kul sachiv manamaane tareeke kaam karte hai
 Its blame should not be laid on the government or the Supreme Court
 vivekanand kehete hai, ‘mujhe nahin pataa tha ki yah maamla itnaa bada ho jayega
 i only went to court against the appointments being made in Banaras Hindu University
 lekin jab faisla aayaa to yah bada maamla ban gaya kyonki yah centre sarkaar or vishvavidhyalay anudaan ayog (ujisi) se judaa hua tha
 Vivekananda Tiwari, who is teaching on the adhoc at the Central Tibetan Studies University, Sarnath, said, 'later my lawyer explained the mathematics of the 13 point roster and the 200 point roster
 ’ vah kehete hai ki, ‘mere kai saare dost dalit, adivasee or pichde virgon ke hai

 i will always remember this match
 ’unhone kaha, ‘tunrat hi mere man main aayaa ki mujhe team se baat kerani chahie
 i spoke to the players in the team bus after the fourth day of play and Australia had not declared their innings then
 maine unhen kaha ki kal wo hamen jo bhi lakshya denge, ham uskaa peechha karne kaa prayaas karenge
 'mahendra Singh Dhoni was injured then, in his absence Kohli captained the team
 kohli ne kaha ki unhone khilaadiyon se poocha ki kya kisi ko koi aapatti yaa hichak he, to unhen tunrat hi bataa dena chahie
 He said, 'nobody objected and then i told him to go to his room with the idea that he would come down to chase the target tomorrow
 ’ is 29 varshiya khilaadi ne 62 test main 19 shatak jad liye hai
 Kohli said, 'we came to the crease on the fifth day thinking that we can win this match
 ham haalanki is lakshya ko hasil nahin kar paae

 Every person has a different upbringing and a different nature

 The first year of marriage makes a big difference in your lifestyle

 maamuli galati par bhi 'shaadi ke baad man nahin lag rahaa' jaise oche coment sunne ko mil sakate hai

 There is a close fight between BJP and Congress in Kolhapur

 Another Asaduddin Owaisi's party MIM has won one seat here
 jabaki anya ke khate main 9 site gai hai
 Six of these are said to be bjp-backed
 agar ye chah bijepi se milte hai to party kaa aankada 49 ho jayega
 Out of 81 seats in Kolhapur, BJP + has 32 seats, Congress 27, NCP 15 and Shiv Sena 4 seats
 bid main bijepi ko jhatkadusri ore, bid main bijepi ko bada jhatka laga he
 BJP leader Pankaja Gopinath Munde belongs to this area
 yahaan 4 main se teen nagar palikaon par ensipi ne kabja jamaa liya he
 Significantly, in the 2010 corporation elections, Shiv Sena got 21 seats, MNS 27, BJP 9, Congress 15 and NCP 14 seats
 iske alaava pichley chunaav main 11 nirdaleey ummidavaaron ne jeet darj kii thi
 The BJP has lagged behind the Shiv Sena in the latest election figures, but it has won the mayoral battle

 Apart from this, Prema Mhatre of Shiv Sena, Shivaji Shelar of BJP and Ashele Manre of BSP were elected unopposed
 ravivaar ko kalyaan-dombiwali nagarpalika main 122 siton or kolhapur main 81 siton par matdaan kiya gaya tha
 Kalyan is an area dominated by MNS, but here she is lagging far behind
 do partiyaan
 BJP and PDP
 saidhantik rup se ekadam vipareet
 But the assembly election results have brought the two closer
 ye pehali baar he ki bijepi jammu-kashmir main sarkaar kaa hissaa banane ja rahi he
 But PDP is on the driving seat with 28 seats as against its 25 seats
 shuukravaar subah pradhanmantri modi or pidipi ke mufti mohammad said ke bich mulaakaat hui
 And also agreement on common minimum program
 jis par pidipi-bijepi sarkaar kaam karegi
 But is it possible -1
 dhara 370:centre main bijepi kii sarkaar banane ke baad sabase pehali controvarsi dhara 370 par hi hui
 Jitendra Singh, Minister of State for PMO, said that after joining the office, this government will consider removing Section 370
 haalanki, kuch din pehle sarkaar ne sansad main spasht kiya he ki sarkaar ke paas is dhara kaa hataane kaa abhi koi prastaav nahin he
 Whatever be the case, this section, which gives special status to Kashmir, has been knocking the BJP and the Sangh from the beginning
 in sab baton ke ulat pidipi ko kashmiriat se judi sabase kattar party mana jaataa he
 Before forming the government in Kashmir, she has been asking for clarification in writing what is her view on the issue of Section 370
 2
 AFSPA: In Kashmir, there has been tension over the AFSPA, a law for the military to act against terrorists or to grant surprise scrutiny
 kashmir kii sabhi partiyaan raajnneetik jarurat ke hisaab se ise hataane kii maang karti rahi hai
 The leaders of the National Conference and Congress have been giving statements about this
 pidipi to ise lekar zyada hi mukhar rahi he
 He is also in favor of talks with Pakistan about this
 dabaav bijepi par hoga
 Which has come from the Hindu areas of the state, while the army's action runs in Muslim dominated areas there
 3
 Nature of the government: Modi and the Mufti have talked about issues
 yaa shaayad sarkaar main hissedari ko lekar bhi
 But it has not been clear whether the BJP will have a Chief Minister in the state
 yadi aisa hoga to baaki mantrimandal main bijepi ko kitne or koun-koun se vibhaag milenge
 How much will be allowed to work 4
 Pressure on the central government: After coming to the PDP government, Modi will try to put more and more pressure on the government to meet the needs of the state by increasing it
 mukhyamantri hone ke naate sara shrey unhen milegaa, isliye bijepi kii sthaneey leadership se khinchataan bhi sambhav he
 5
 vipaksh kaa dabaav:vidhansabha main neshnal conference or congress ko kramash: 15 or 12 siten mili hai
 These 27 mlas would like to bring out the conflicting ideology of PDP and BJP
 donon partiyon ke saamne dharmsankat khadaa kiya jaae
 As soon as there is an army operation or encounter, they will surround the PDP about what she is going to talk to the Prime Minister about AFSPA
 iske alaava modi sarkaar ke liye sakshi maharaj jaise netaa jis tarah pareshaani khadi karte hai, vaise hi pidipi ke bhi kuch netaa bayaan dene main belgaum hai
 It will not take long to grow bitterness
 dekhnaa hoga, donon partiyon kaa ye satta sukh kab tak kaayam rahata he

 It is difficult to say when politics takes place
 thik vaise hi rajanetaaon ko kab koun si baat yaad aa jaae yaa phir yah ki kab paraayaa apana ban jaae pataa nahin chalata
 Lalu Prasad has a similar situation in Bihar at this time
 argedy pramukh ko achaanak se in dinon atal bihari vaajapeyi yaad aane lage hai, vahi vaajapeyi jinpar shabdabaan chalaane se lalu kabhi gurej nahin karte the
 Lalu Prasad says that he is 'miss' Atal Bihari Vajpayee a lot these days
 vah kehete hai, 'atal bihari jaisi raajnneeti aaj nahin rahi
 When Atal ji was Prime Minister, he used to talk and talk easily with a phone, and Vajpayee used to listen, but today is not the same
 ' lalu prasad kaa kahana he ki laalkrishna adwani bhi saaf-suthriraajnneetikarne vaale netaa hai, lekinbijepimen aaj unhen tadapane ke liye chhod diya gaya he
 Actually, it is not difficult to understand this 'missing' politics of Lalu
 spasht he ki lalu prasad ne atal or adwani ke bahaane sidhe taur par narendra modi par prahaar kiya he
 Modi describes himself as the path of Atal
 aise main atal ke bahaane modi par hamalaa zyada kargar ho jaataa he
 While Advani's indifference to Narendra Modi is no longer hidden from anyone
 bihar kii raajnneeti kaa 'ganesh'lalu ne khud ko bihar kii raajnneeti kaa 'ganesh' ghoshit kiya he
 He said, 'everyone revolves around them'
 lalu ne kaha ki bihar kii raajnneeti unase hi shuru hogi or unke aasapaas hi ghumegi, vahibihar kii raajnneetike ganpati hai
 Lalu's statement has come at a time when the debate on 'bada Kaun' has started between Nitish and Lalu in Bihar
 lalu ne nitish kumaar ko siem pad kaa cheharaa bhale bataa diya ho, lekin vah yah jataane se nahin chook rahe ki raajnneeti unke hi ird-gird ghumegi
 Lalu Prasad has been integrating gods in politics even before
 2005 ke chunaav ke thik pehle unhone ek baar rabari devi ko saakshaat durga kaha tha
 There was a time when the number of students studying engineering was very high
 vahiin ab taaja aankadon ke anusaar ejineering main admician lene vaale chaatro kii sankhya main kami ai he
 The reason for the shortage is being attributed to the interest of the students, which is gradually ending in engineering
 isi vajah se kai college band ho gaye hai or kai college band hone ke asaar hai
 According to data released by the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), the number of total engineering admissions in the country has seen the fastest decline in these five years
 website da indian express ne eisitii kii ore se bataaya he ki saal 2017-18 main desh bhar main ejineering kii 1
 67 lakh seats have been reduced
 pichley saal ke anusaar yah giravat doguni he
 16 in undergraduate and postgraduate engineering last year
 62 lakh siten thi, or 2016-17 main 17
 There were 5 lakh seats
 nahin bananaa he ejeeniyar, band ho jaaenge desh main 200 ejineering college!aapako bataa den, saal 2012- 2013 se ejineering main admician lene vaale chaatro kii sankhya main kareeb 1
 86 lakhs decreased
 jiske baad saal 2016 se paaya gaya ki har saal ejineering main admician lene vaale chaatro kii sankhya main lagaataar kami aa rahi he
 At the same time, according to AICTE, every year about 75,000 students are declining
 saal 2016-17 main bii / beatech kii 51 fisadi siten 3291 college main khaali rah gayi thi
 Girwat of engineering seats is increasing continuously
 aapako bataa den, ab kai collejon ne eisitii se sampark kar beatech or emtek siton ko kam karne kaa anurodh kiya he
 At the same time, the major reason for the decrease in the seat is being told to 755 colleges which have about 92,553 seats
 in collejon ne eisitii se seat main kami or kuch ejineering branch ko puraa band karne kii maang kii he
 Dream of becoming an engineer? So job at your own risk
 
 
 eisitii abhi 83 ejineering college ko band karne ke liye sahamat ho gai
 After the closure of these colleges, 24,290 seats will be reduced
 duusari ore lagbhag 53 sansthaanon ko dandit kiya gaya he
 Due to which 17,907 seats have been reduced
 eisitii ke sutron ke mutabik, ejineering siton main ye giravat pichley kuch saalon se collejon main kam admician kii vajah se bataaya ja rahaa he
 At the same time, the biggest reason for not taking admission in engineering college is that students have been told not to get jobs in this field

 ’’ Bismillah Khan, a famous shehnai player who was melodious in the sound of Indian classical music and culture, was born on 21 March 1916 in a Bihari Muslim family in Dumraon, Bihar
 unki shehanai kii dhun kaa divaana aaj bhi har koi he
 Let's know interesting things related to him on his birthday: -1
 bismilla khan kaa bachapan kaa naam qamruddin tha
 He was the second child of his parents
 chunki unke bade bhai kaa naam shamshuddin tha isliye unke dada rasul baksh ne kaha 'bismillah' jiskaa matlab tha 'acchhee shuruyaat'
 He later became known as 'bismillah Khan'
 tabhi se aaj tak duniya unhen 'bismilla khan' ke naam se jaanati he
 2
 bismilla khan ko sangeet viraasat main mila tha kyonki unke khandaan ke log darvari raag bajaane main maahir the, jo bihar kii bhojpur riyasat main apane sangeet kaa hunar dikhaane ke liye aksar jaaya karte the
 3
 unke pita bihar kii dumraanv riyasat ke maharaja keshav prasad singh ke darbar main shehanai bajaayaa karte the
 4
 mahaj 6 saal kii umr main bismilla khan apane pita ke saath banaras aa gayi
 There he learned to play the clarinet from his uncle Ali Baksh 'vilayati'
 unke ustad chachaa 'vilayati' vishwanath mandir main sthaayee rup se shehanai-vaadan kaa kaam karte the
 5
 14 saal kii umr main pehali baar elahabaad ke sangeet parishad main bismilla khan ne shehanai bajaane kaa program kiya
 After which he appeared in a short time as a first class shehnai player
 6
 Ustad Bismillah Khan, honored with the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award, Padma Shri, Padma Bhushan, Padma Vibhushan, Tansen Award, was conferred India's highest honor 'bharataratna' in 2001
 7
 On 15 August 1947, on the eve of the country's independence, the shehnai of Bismillah Khan with the tricolor fluttering on the Red Fort welcomed the independent India by playing the clarinet
 kamaal kii baat ye he ki har saal 15 agast ko pradhanmantri ke bhaashan ke baad bismillah khan kaa shehanai vaadan desh ke swatantraaa utsav kii ek pratha ban gai
 8
 bismilla khan ne 'bajri', 'chaiti' or 'jhula' jaisi locadhunon main baaje ko apni tapasya or riyaaz se khub sanvaara or clasical mausiqii main shehanai ko sammanjanak sthaan dilaayaa
 9
 unki shehanai afghanistan, europe, iran, iraq, canada, pashchim africa, america, japan, honkong or vishwa bhar kii lagbhag sabhi deshon main goonjati rahi
 The film world was also not untouched by the resonance of his shehnai
 10
 He wanted to play the clarinet at Delhi's India Gate, but it could not happen
 21 agast 2006 unhone duniya ko alavida kah diya

 However, after Zardari's repatriation, the political stir there has intensified
 congress chhattisgarh vidhansabha chunaav kii siyaasi jang fatah karne ke liye puri takat laga rahi he
 Keeping this in mind, party president Rahul will arrive in Raipur on a day-long visit

 yah aisa mausam he, jab gali-mohallon main ek hafte pehle se hi laudspikar par azaadi ke gane or soshal media par vir ras se las post ke jariye logon ke andar deshbhakti kii hawa bhar jaati he
 Just think, if there was an information revolution in the era of the freedom movement, then this fight for independence could have been a little easier, someone would update the photo on Facebook, someone would write a tiger against the British on Twitter, or some train in a group of whatsapp There would have been a plan to rob
 lekin kaash, sab kuch itnaa aasaan hota
 At that time there were problems of communication, it was not so easy to convey the message, the British had a sharp eye and censorship on it
 na kuch bol sakate the, na kuch chhap sakate the
 In such a situation, the patriots resorted to freedom looms to take on the British, who kept boiling in the veins of Indians, sometimes in the form of prayer, sometimes in the form of heroic juice

 Neither could speak or could print anything
 aise main angrejon se loha lene main deshbhakton ne azaadi ke taraanon kaa sahaara liya, jo kabhi prarthana ke rup main, kabhi vir ras ke rup main bharatiyon kii nason main ubaal laate rahe
 India is called the land of the people, we enjoy listening more than reading, and if they are in the shape of singing, then the thing is different
 aisi kai or prarthanaayen or taraane the, jisane azaadi kii ladaai main jaan phoonk di, lekin inke rachanakaaron ke naam kabhi saamne nahin aa paae
 The special thing was that it was a little difficult for the British to understand these words, so Prabhat Pheri was removed, which echoed the ray of freedom
 
 
 'utho sone waalon, savera hua he, vatan ke faqiron kaa pheraa hua he

 ' alag-alag tareeke se apni baat sab tak pahunchane kii koshish har baar rang nahin laati thi
 In the British era, it was not so easy to say your point
 aise main sahityakaron ne apane tareeke se logon tak baat pahunchane kaa bidaa uthaaya
 He started talking in similes, which was the way the British used to think before banning it because it had literary elements
 raza nakvi ke maanjhi geet main vahi baat nazar aati he
 
 
 'the clouds also shine Manjhi, lightning also shines Manjhi, daaen baayen sannata he or raat andheri he maanjhi, Extinguishes the mind haa, kashti tej chalaa maanjhi

 yahi nahin, aaj ke ulat us vakt ke gaanon ke jariye logon ko jail jane ke liye prerit bhi kiya jaataa tha, jaise
 
 
 'listen, Gose-heartedly, these words, anokhe niraale hai jangi fasaane, Somewhere mourning, some weddings, isi tarah katate rahenge jamaane, Do some courage, don't find excuses, chalo jail khaane

 ' Apart from this, the 'victorious world tricolor Pyara' of Shyamlal Gupta 'councilor' cannot be forgotten
 jaliyanvaala baag or bhagat singh kii faansee se judi samvednaaon ko bhi geeton main piroyaa gaya
 One such memorable incident is related to the lion, when Ashfaq had gone to Bismil for some work in the Arya Samaj temple (shahjahanpur) and was humming this ghazal of Jigar Muradabadi


 ‘kaun yeh yeh tamanna is in the floor of Ishq
 jo tamanna dil se nikali phir jo dekha dil main he
 ' bismil yah sher sunakar muskaraa die to ashfaq ne puch hi liya, 'kyon ram bhai! maine misra kuch galat kah diya kya?' is par bismil ne jawaab diya 'nahin mere krishna kanhaiya! yah baat nahin
 i respect Jigar Saheb a lot, but he shot a big arrow on the old ground of Mirza Ghalib, calling it a lion-beaten lion
 koi nai rangath dete to main bhi irshaad kahata
 ' ashfaq ko bismil kii yah baat janchi nahin, unhone chunauti bhare lahaze main kaha, 'to ram bhai! ab aap hi isamen girah lagaaie, maan jaaoongaa, aapaki soch jigar or mirza gaalib se bhi parale darje kii he
 'at the same time, Pandit Ramprasad' Bismil 'read this lion


 "sarfaroshi's desire is now in our heart
 dekhnaa he jor kitna baazuu-e-qaatil main he"tippaniyan On hearing this, Ashfaq jumped up and hugged Bismil and said, "ram brother! i agree, you are also masters of maestro
" ' vaise to ashfaq ne is gazal ko kai baar padhaa he lekin is baat ko lekar abhi bhi sanshay he ki ise likhaa kisne he? samachar website bibisi hindi main chhapi ek report ke mutabik ise likhane vaale bismil azimaabadi hai or ye kaazi abdul gaffaar kii patrika ‘sabaah’ main 1922 main chhapi thi jiske baad angrezon ne is par pratibandh laga diya tha

 In view of the Lok Sabha elections of the film 'PM Narendra Modi', many political meanings are being extracted
 pehle hi purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh par aadhaarit film 'da accidental prime ministar (the Accidental Prime Minister)' ko lekar pehle hi maahaul garmaaya hua he
 However, now everyone's eye is on this biopic of Prime Minister Narendra Modi as it will show many incidents of his life, and it will be seen by the opponents

 As soon as Trinamool Congress separated from UPA, the government has made preparations to increase rail fares
 raahat kii baat sirf itani he ki saadhaaran shrenee ke kiraayon main philhal badhotaree nahin kii ja rahi he
 The prices of AC trains tickets, freight fares and food at railway stations will go up from October 1 and service tax will be levied on them
 rail mantri si pi joshi or vitt mantri pi chidambaram ke bich baithak ke baad is babaat faisla liya gaya
 a senior railway ministry official said that fares for AC First Class, Executive Class, AC 2 Tier, AC 3 Tier and AC Kursiyan are from October 1 to 3
 708 fisadi kii vruddhi hogi or is sambandh main adhisuchana jari kii ja rahi he
 He informed that apart from this, service tax will also be levied on freight and other services
 seva kar 12
 36 per cent but after adjusting 70 per cent it is 3 on AC class passenger fares and freight fares
 708 fisadi padegaa
 However, services offered at stations such as catering and parking are 12
 36 fisadi vruddhi kaa bhaar jhelana padegaa kyonki in sevaaon main koi saamanjasy nahin kiya gaya he
 The decision comes within days of Trinamool Congress's departure from the UPA government

 The official said that in the event of cancellation of ticket, service tax amount will not be refunded to the passengers
 riyayati tikaton par seva kar kul keemat kaa 30 fisadi hoga
 Under the Finance Bill 2012, passengers traveling in AC category were brought under service tax from July but it was not being implemented due to opposition from Trinamool Congress
 dilli vidhansabha kii 70 main se 67 seat jitakaram aadmi party (aap) ne itihaas rach diya
 This is exactly what happened in Sikkim some twenty years ago
 jab vahaan 1993 main bane sikkim democratic front (esadf) ne agle saal hi rajya main apni sarkaar bana lee thi
 And this power remains till today
 aaie,ek najar daalate hai 'aap' orsikkim democratic frant kii kuch samaantaaon par-1
 The SDF formed its government the following year of establishment
 usee tarah aam aadmi party ne bhi gathan ke kuch maah baad hi 2013 main dilli main satta hasil kii thi
 And formed the government with an unprecedented majority in this election of 2015
 2
 The ideology of the SDF is based on democratic socialism
 janata ke shashan kii kalpana ke saath party main sabhi dharmon or virgon ke liye samaan adhikaar hai
 Similarly, the ideology of the Aam Aadmi Party is based on Swaraj
 yani apana raaj, janata kaa raaj
 3
 dilli or sikkim, donon hi rajyon kaa aakaar chota he
 There are nine districts in Delhi
 to sikkim main chaar
 The way the SDF researched the basic issues district-wise
 vaise hi aap kii ek team pichley do saal se dilli main kar rahi he
 4
 esadf 1994 ke chunaav ke baad pawan kumaar chamling ke netritv main nirantar satta main he
 This party further strengthened its position with the success of the 1999 and 2004 assembly elections
 2009 ke chunaavon main esadf ne rajya kii sabhi 32 siton par jeet hasil kii thi
 He also occupied the only Lok Sabha seat in Sikkim
 aam aadmi party ne 2013 ke vidhaan sabha chunaav main dilli kii 70 main se 28 siten hasil kii thi
 After this, in the Lok Sabha elections 2014, four party mps from Punjab were also elected
 or haal ke chunaav main party ne 70 main se 67 siton par jeet kaa paracham laharaaya diya
 5
 pahari ilaaka hone kii vajah se sikkim main zyada industry aadi nahin hai
 The biggest source of income is tourism
 esadf sarkaar kam sansadhano ke baavjood janata ko zyada suvidhaayen dene kii koshish karti rahi
 The Aam Aadmi Party also wants to provide maximum facilities to the people of Delhi
 jinamein sadak, pani or bijli praathamikta he
 The major sources of income of the Delhi government are sales tax and excise
 6
 The Sikkim government has cut all taxes and VAT to provide relief to the people of the state
 jisaki vajah se janata par zyada dabaav nahin rahata
 Similarly, you are also in favor of exemption in taxes of the states
 taaki dilli ke nichle tabake ko raahat mil sake7
 The SDF has held its government accountable to the public
 bhrashtachar rokane ke liye vyapak str par nigaraanee hoti he
 Time is fixed for all government functions
 sabhi rajkeey kaaryon main paardarshita banaakar rakhi jaati he
 The entire tax system is online
 aam aadmi party bhi sarkaar or janata ke bich paardarshita kii baat karti he
 8
 esadf kii sarkaar ne rajya ke buniyaade dhaanche ko majboot banane ke liye har sambhav prayaas kiye hai
 Involved the public directly in many campaigns
 rajya ko saaf sudhara banane ke liye muhim chalaai
 You also promise to make Delhi clean and tidy
 slam or jeje coloniyon main vikaas kar safai or hariyaali sthapit karnaa party kaa makasad he
 The Sikkim government made the citizens of the state responsible for the development and cleanliness of their cities
 aap bhi dilli waalon ko yahi sabak dena chaahati he ki rajya ke naagarik bhi apni jimmedaari kaa paalan karen
 Be aware of public property
 9
 There are more organizations from every political party
 yuva, mahila evam chaatr sanghathan aadi
 But the SDF has ten different frontal organizations
 jinamein yuva, mahila, chaatr ke alaava majdoor, seva nivrutt karmchaaree, anusuchit jati, anusuchit janajati ke alaava vaahan chaalak sanghathan bhi shaamil hai
 The Aam Aadmi Party is also expanding the organization in this direction
 aap ne auto chaalkon kaa ek sanghathan aam aadmi party auto sanghathan 'aas' bana rakhaa he
 10
 esadf kii sarkaar janata ko muft shiksha or swasth sevaayen de rahi he
 30 percent of the state government's total budget is spent on education
 aam aadmi party kaa agenda bhi kuch aisa hi he
 The party has been advocating free education and health services in Delhi
 chunaav main yah ek bada chunavi mudda bhi rahaa
 11
 rajya main logon ko sibar or internet friendli banane ke liye sikkim sarkaar ne sibar village yojana shuru kii he
 Under which people from rural areas will be able to collect information and agriculture related information through internet
 isi tarah aap ne chunaav agenda main dilli ko muft vaai-faai suvidha dene kaa elaan kiya tha
 So that every Delhiites can use the internet for free

 So Abida also became a victim of this desire
 magar shuru se aisa na tha
 When Abida came to know about Majid Bhai, he did not fail
 magar us din kisi nikaah kii daavat main unase nigaah do chaar ho gai
 Abida remained tough from above
 magar bheetar se sheer maal si tar mithaas bhar gai jehan main
 He felt like a layer of dried pistachios spread over kheer
 kheer main doobane utraane ko aatur
 Abida and Majid are united
 parivaar khush, paravaradigaar khush
 But not everyone had to walk like this
 varanaa kahani kaise banati
 This story too is not a juggling of any contractor and engineer
 mode na aae, mushkal na aae, to koi ilm ko kyon kar yaad kare
 Abida would have been separated, but then also a fear
 ki kahin maajid kaa ishkia mizaaj unhen dur na kare
 Once, something like this happened that Abida kept away from Majid because of it
 sasuraal main kabhi saas kii seva karti to kabhi nanad kii jachagi karaati
 And on the other hand, Majid felt like grinding in his memory
 jab had ho gai to jism ko ek maand mili
 Named Mona
 muaamala tab khulaa, jab is aurat ke hamal thahar gaya
 Zahid told Abida
 or yahaan se tihari yantranaa kaa daur shuru hua
 Abida did not abuse Zahid
 bas bechaargi, dayaa or dildaari kii tirangi chadar odh lee
 One day the monstrous mona rate reached
 use ye kehane
 That you did not fall child
 main teri dekhbhaal karuungi
 Majid turned into a heap that looked sharp from outside, but scorched inside
 or mona
 He only knew how to cook bread for his stomach through the fire of body
 bacchee hote na hote, bahut kuch badalane laga
 Made less, more broken
 judane kii koshish main kuch or
 And what was left in the end was just a lesson
 junglee kabutar ismat aapa kii ek lambii kahani yaa ki chota upanyaas he
 It would be appropriate to leave this debate to critics anyway
 hamaare hisse to ye kissa hi bhala
 You will read it in one go
 chote chote silasilon or byoron ke jariye manjar bandhata
 And then the story was filled with fervor that you could not even complain that the eyes had just stopped

 buraai par achchhai kii jeet ke pratik ke taur par ravan dahan prativarsh isi ramlila maidan main kiya jaataa he or yah kaam pichley kuch varshon se pradhanmantri manmohan singh or congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi karti ain hai, lekin is baar bhrashtachar rupi ravan kaa dahan karne kii baari anna hajaare kii he
 If we consider the historical backdrop of Ramlila Maidan, it is said that the British got it ready for the camps of British soldiers in the year 1883
 ajmeri get or turkman get ke bich 10 acre main faile ramlila maidan main ek lakh log khadey ho sakate hai or police kii maane to isaki kshamta 25 se 30 hajaar logon kii hi he
 Over time, many organizations in Old Delhi started staging Ramlila in this ground and due to this it was identified as Ramlila Maidan
 desh kii aazaadee kii ladaai ke dauraan mahatma gandhi, jawaharlal nehru, mohammad ali jinna, sardaar vallabhbhai patel or jaiprakash narayan jaise netaaon ne bhi virodh pradarshan ke liye isi maidan ko apni pansad banaaya
 In December 1952 at the Ramlila Maidan, Satyagraha was organized by Shyama Prasad Mukherjee on the issue of Jammu and Kashmir, which completely rocked the government
 desh ke pehle pradhanmantri jawahar laal nehru ne bhi 1956-57 main isi maidan main apni jansabhaayen kii
 Queen Elizabeth of Britain addressed a large public meeting in this ground on January 28, 1961
 china ke saath 1962 ke yuddh main mili haar ke baad 26 janvari, 1963 main pradhanmantri jawaharlal nehru kii maujuudagi main sur samraji lata mangeshkar ne bhi isi maidan main ek aitihaasik kaarykram prastut kiya tha
 He gave his voice to the patriotic song 'aye Mere Watan peoples, fill in the eyes, remember those who have been martyred', written by the touching poet Pradeep
 1965 main pakistan ke khilaaf ladaai ke dauraan isi maidan main tatkaaleen pradhanmantri laal bahadur shastri ne jai jawan, jai kisaan kaa naaraa diya tha
 In 1972, the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi addressed a historic public meeting at the same ground to celebrate the creation of Bangladesh and victory in the war against Pakistan
 1975 main jaiprakash narayan ne isi maidan se indira gandhi kii netritv vaali saraakar ko ukhaad phenkane kaa aahvaan kiya tha
 The famous poet Ramdhari Singh Dinkar's famous line, 'empty the throne that the public comes', was raised by the people as a slogan
 is vishaal raily se dari sahami indira gandhi kii sarkaar ne 25-26 june, 1975 kii raat ko apatkaal kii ghoshnaa kar di thi
 Talking about the recent times, this is the same Ramlila ground, where yoga guru Baba Ramdev raised his voice against the government on the issue of black money
 5 june, 2011 ko ramdev ke samarthakon par police ne jamkar laathiyaan barasaai thim
 Now Anna's historical movement continues in this ground
 wo ped par baitha tha
 You on the stage
 wo ped se nahin utraa
 You did not get off the stage
 fark ye ki wo duniya chhod gaya or aap sab insaaniyat chhod gaye
 And now all the leaders are speaking on the death of the same Gajendra
 khub bol rahe hai
 But then finally they are also saying that there should be no politics on this death
 ab apane netaaon se koi puche ki phir raajnneeti kar koun rahaa he?bol sab rahe hai
 But no one is saying koi nahin kah rahaa ki aakhir gajendra kii maut kaa jimmedaar he koun? gajendra to dilli ke jantar-mantar se aspataal hote hue apane gaanv jaakar panchtatv main villin bhi ho gaya
 But their leaders still do not hawk when they become a vulture, circling the corpse of sensation
 shahadat main lapet kar maut kaa mol lagaate hue koi kaagaj ke chand tukade dene kaa elaan kar rahaa he to koi gajendra ke bahaane sookhe khet par apni siyaasi fasal kaatane main lag gaya he
 Suddenly, the farmer of the country has become beloved by everyone
 kejariwal sahab, aap aam aadmi-aam aadmi ratate nahin thakte
 Your every thing, every promise, every fight, every dharna starts from the common man but ends at the common man itself
 phir aap to unamem se hai jo kehete hai ki viipi culture khatm karnaa he, aam aadmi ko khud uth kar khud aage bad kar kaam karnaa he
 But here before your eyes a common man climbs the tree
 baqayada gale main fanda kasata he
 Then he waits with complete satisfaction
 aap sab rahe the
 You were knowing everything
 par kar kya rahe the? intjaar? ki wo latak jaae phir aap harakat main aaenge
 Hey, if you would have taken the responsibility of being a citizen at that time, then you would not have to go to the hospital with Manish Sisodia
 kejariwal sahab
 
 
 You you aapke khaas kumaar vishwaas ke bare main kya kahen
 
 
 Seeing Gajendra hanging on the tree, he is asking from the stage what is hanging? And then the hands start cursing the Delhi Police
 vishwaas sahab kavi bhi hai
 It is said that the heart of the poet is very soft
 police ko laanat bhejne kii bajaay agar manch se utar kar 25 kadam khud chal lete to gajendra batch jaataa
 It is about Delhi Police
 to police amuman maukey par der se pahunchane ke liye badnaam he
 But here the police was already present before the accident
 bas vakt rahete use ped par chadhana tha
 But even she could not climb the tree in time
 is ped par buudhvaar ko sirf gajendra kii maut nahin hui
 
 
 Rather, humanity died with him
 ab uski maut par garajane or jehar ugalane waalon jitna bhi garjo gajendra ko uskaa muaavja nahin de sakate
 Did Gajendra really want to commit suicide? Did he reach Delhi to commit suicide by walking hundreds of miles away from Dausa? Or did he fall prey to the accident after getting into someone's provocation? We are not raising this question
 
 
 balki ye kahana he khud gajendra ke gharavaalon kaa
 
 
 Who had told the family before his death that he would come on TV today
 or dopaher ke dedh bajte-bajte wo sachmuch tivi par aa gaya
 It came as the whole country watched live
 use or uski maut ko
 But the question now is whether Gajendra wanted to climb the tree and come on TV only as a spectacle or to show his death live? If he had already made up his mind to commit suicide and had reached Jantar Mantar in Delhi, then why was there no mention of suicide in his last slip? Hail rains in Dausa undoubtedly damaged Gajendra's crop
 
 
 lekin ye koi aisi vajah nahin thi ki wo sidhe khudakushi kar letaa
 
 
 And that too hundreds of miles from home, Delhi Police of Delhi had written two letters to him before the Aam Aadmi Party rally
 
 
 or donon hi chitthiyon main raily main 5 hajaar se zyada bheed naa jutaney kii taakid kii thi
 It was also said that if this happens, it can happen
 or police kii maane to raily main 5 hajaar se zyada kii bheed jute gai thi
 So did the Delhi Police anticipate any untoward incident at the Aam Aadmi Party rally? sunwaayee ke dauraan supreme court ne kaha ki kaha shelter home main bacchiyon ko drugs diya gaya
 This situation is very serious
 court ne sibiai kii dhimi jaanch par bhi sawaal uthaaye
 The Supreme Court also objected to the transfer of officers of the CBI investigation team
 supreme court ne sibiai ko nirdesh diya ki wo kal tak 20 sitambar kii team or ab kii team kii suchi daakhil kare
 Earlier, the Supreme Court had said that there would be no change in the investigation team
 duusari taraf, is maamle main bihar ke begusarai ke espi ne kaha ki manju verma ke khilaaf aaropon ko abhi tak sahi nahin paaya gaya he
 Therefore his arrest has not been done

 Does Modi ji blame anyone on this subject or not? Did you ask for an explanation from the NSA, IB Chief, and Raw Chief? Former Chief Minister Digvijay Singh asked Prime Minister Modi and his ministers for an opinion on the Uttar Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya calling the Pulwama attack an accident
 pulavama aatanki hamale ko maine “durghatana” kah diya to modi ji se le kar 3 kendriya mantri ji mujhe pakistan samarthak bataane main jute gayi

 He alleged that Digvijay is the general secretary of jaish-e-mohammed rather than the general secretary of the Congress

 The code of conduct prepared by the Ministry of Home Affairs says that all ministers have to submit details of their income and assets to the Prime Minister's Office by 31 August

 However, when NDTV contacted the office of these ministers, Rajnath Singh's office said that they are preparing all the documents and will soon file the details as per the Prime Minister's wish

 chhattisgarh ke gariyaaband jile ke supebedagaanv main kareeb dhai hajaar log rahete hai
 In this village, 55 people died in just six months from a kidney infection
 yahaan 187 aise marij hai jinka sarkari aspataal main ilaaj chal rahaa he
 Initially the villagers did not count the deaths here but when they suspected the presence of any toxic chemical in the drinking water, they started collecting the death figures
 is gaanv kii haalat ye he ki is gaanv main naa to ladke-ladakiyon kii shaadi ho rahi he or naa hi koi rishtedaar hi yahaan aata he
 They too feel that if they drank the water of this village, they too would fall prey to the kidney disease
 chhattisgarh kii rajdhani raipur se maatr 140 kimi dur sthit supabeda gaanv main har hafte kisi naa kisi kii maut ho jaati he
 Or simply say that there is no such day of the year left when weeds do not occur in some house
 har hafte yahaan koi naa koi bemaut maaraa jaataa he phir wo chaahe baccha ho bada yaa phir boodha ho
 That too from kidney infection
 haal hi main is gaanv main 18 saal kaa devraj kaa maut ho gai
 Here almost daily, a person from the village is admitted to a government or non-government hospital for dialysis
 is gaanv ke zyaadaatar log kidney kii beemaari se peedit hai lekin jaanch ke dauraan doctor ye nahin bataa paae he ki aakhir beemaari kya he
 Despite so many deaths, the villagers have not stopped drinking the water provided by the tap water schemes
 kabhi channa daalkar to kabhi fitkaree gholkar yahaan ke log pani ko saaf karte hai
 The public health engineering department of the government tested the water here but it did not find any impurities in the water
 udhar gramin aisi kisi khatraanak vastu kaa bhi istemaal nahin karte jisase unhen kidney main beemaari yaa infections tak kii sambhaavna ho
 The entire population of the village depends on agricultural work
 wo naa hi itnaa adhikpastisiteor kitnashkon kaa upyog karte he jisase unamem shaarrik durbalata kaa khatra ho
 Despite this, the deaths that occur here are due to kidney disease
 gaanv ke panch rajesh sahu ke mutabik ab tak wo gaanv main hone vaali mauton kaa byora nahin rakhte the lekin lagaataar hone vaali mauton kii vajah se ab panchayat main marane vaale shaks kii puri medical report rakhi jaati he
 According to him, 55 deaths have occurred in the last months, which is very serious
 is gaanv main camp kar rahe raipur ke sarkari medical college ke neprology vibhaag ke doctor sunil geete ke mutabik wo kidney infections se judidvaaiyangraminon ko muhaiyaa kara rahe hai
 Apart from this, investigations are being done on four points which are related to the surroundings and personal use of the villagers
 is gaanv main swasthya shivi lagaakar sarkaar apni aupchaarikta puri kar rahi he

 Ananya Pandey made a great debut with Student of the Year 2
 bhale hi film pehle part jaisaa jaadu nahin bikher pai magar ananyaa pandey kii acting ko saraahaa gaya
 Some time ago, Ananya said during an interview that even after being selected for a journalism course at a US college, she was unable to go there because she had to make time for her debut film
 ek insta yujar ne unki baat ko jhootha qaraar dete hue kaha tha ki ananyaa ne kabhi bhi kisi fahrren universti ke liye aplai nahin kiya tha
 Ananya has given a befitting reply with proof on Insta
 unhone kaha, "main aisa karnaa nahin chaahati thi
 i don't think i need to explain anything to anyone
 magar pichley kuch samay se ye juthi khabar fail rahi he ki maine USC ke admician ke liye aplai nahin kiya tha
 Now it became too much
 sabase zyada dukh kii baat ye he ki mere parivaar or doston ko isse guzarana pad rahaa he
 As i said earlier, i was selected for the Spring 2018 semester of Annaberg School for Communication and Journalism
 "view this post on instagrami didn’t want to do this
 i didn't feel like i needed to explain myself to anyone, but the rumors that i faked my admission at USC have been doing the rounds for a while now
 They've been getting out of hand, and it’s even more unfair and sad that my family and friends have to go through this
 As I've stated earlier, i was accepted by Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism at USC for a major in Communication in the Spring 2018 semester
 But since i was shooting for my first film and the release date later got pushed, i had to request for a deferral (which means postponing my admission) twice - first to Fall 2018 and later to Fall 2019, both of which they gracefully agreed to do
 In my case, i could only defer my admission two times so i will not be attending university (for now), since I've decided to pursue my career in acting
 As for the people who have been trying to pull me down with these accusations, i would like to send you all lots of love, peace and positivity
 And would also like to say that even though they're to be my classmates (nameless and faceless) - I'm sure they aren't because I've grown up with the people i went to school with and they would never do something like that
 It's never okay to bully anyone - creating fake conversations, stories and screenshots is very dangerous and can seriously damage people’s lives
 So please be loving, positive and kind
 ❤ (PS - my father’s real name is Suyash and i blurred out my address for security reasons)a post shared byananya 👩🏻🎓💫(@ananyapanday) onjun 8, 2019 at 2:36am pdt"magar kyonki main apni pehali film kii shooting main biji thi or relies date do baar aage ke liye shift kar di gai thi, mujhe do baar apana admician postpon karana padaa
 This happened for the first time in the year 2018 and the second time in the year 2019
 donon baar hi meri request except kar lee gai
 In my case it is such that i can postpone my admissions only twice so i can no longer go to university
 is vajah se maine acting kariyar kii taraf dhyaan diya
