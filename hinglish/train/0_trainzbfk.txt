 As the case progressed in court, the prosecution remained vigilant and was found to be vigilant in its arguments
 2
 During the whole hearing it was very difficult to understand what the prosecution was trying to prove in court with its arguments
 3
 The prosecution was presenting a very weak plea and by the time the trial in the case was over, it became clear to the court that the prosecution had become completely directionless
 4
 Special government lawyers and general government lawyers appointed in the case were found to argue in different directions without any coordination
 ise bhi padhein: court main sabit nahin hua ghotaalaa, jaaniye kya tha 2G spectrum aavanton kaa puraa maamla5
 Most of the documents presented by the Telecom Ministry were unorganized and the policy issues of the Ministry were further complicating the whole matter due to which no one understood the whole matter
 6
 The disorganized documents and policies of the Ministry raise suspicion that some particular facts were presented in a special way to give scam to the case and many facts were drawn to such a level that it was impossible to understand the case

 The US drone attack on Saturday targeted a Pakistani Taliban complex in the country's restive northwest tribal region near the Afghan border, killing 11 extremists
 adhikariyon ne bataaya ki yah hamalaa uttari wajiristaan main kiya gaya, jahaan pichley maheene se pakistani sena taliban or anya charampanthiyon ke lambey samay se maujuud thikaanon ko khatm karne ke liye lard rahi he
 On Saturday, eight missiles were fired from a drone in the compound, killing 11 members of the Pakistani Taliban faction, a senior security official in the area said
 adhikari ne bataaya ki maare gaye charampanthiyon main pakistan taliban ke do 'mahatvapurn' commando shaamil hai, lekin unhone unki pahchaan kaa khulaasa karne se inkaar kar diya
 An official had earlier reported the death of eight extremists

 The canal is the pulse of the voters of Jhunjhunu district that anyone can press on at the last moment in the election summer
 or is nabj kii kamajori ko diggaj congressi netaa shishram ola se behatar bhala koun jaan saktaa he, jo apane harek chunaav main nahar ko mudda banaate hai or jeet bhi jate hai
 In the last election too, he had crossed the Naiya Canal
 is baar ola ne nahar kii maang kar ek tir se do nishane saadhe hai
 One, the elections are next year, so we have to look for the weak pulse of the voters and the second is to show Gehlot an eye
 kuch aise hi iraadon ke saath pichley dinon ola ne nahar laane ke liye gahalot sarkaar ke khilaaf jile main ek din kaa pradarshan kiya
 In this demonstration, Ola whipped up the Gehlot government and the Haryana government
 ola kii maane to jab ve centre main jal sansaadhan rajya mantri the tab unhone centre water kamishan kii manjuuri ke saath 934 karod ru
 Get the canal approved at Jhunjhunu
 lekin rajasthan or haryana main alag-alag dalon kii sarkarein hone se sahmati patr par hastakshar nahin hue
 Says Ola, "I am willing to fight across the canal
" ''ola ne jamaa bheed se sahyog maanga or saath main yah bhi kaha ki gahalot sarkaar se hamaari koi dushmani nahin he lekin jile main pani kii jarurat pehle he
 Their demand is valid, but Ola's words were political because before this demonstration BJP leader Sumitra Singh had said that she will support Ola in the demonstration on the demand of canal
 par ola ne saaf kah diya ki manch par koi bhaajapai nahin baithegaa
 Reacting to this, Sumitra described Ola as a psychopath and said, "ola is not interested in bringing politics, but in politics
" ''khayr, ab raajnneeti kii baat karen to ola kii is sabha main koi congressi vidhayak nahin tha or na hi baari jansamarthan jute paaya
 Describing this meeting as a gimmick, Jhunjhunu BJP district president Dashrath Singh Shekhawat says, "the people of the district are bored with both Ola and Canal
" pradarshan main ek lakh se zyada bheed honi thi lekin hui 2,000
 Public knows everything
 ''pichley teen dashak se ola nahar ke mudde se jude hai or kai baar ve anshan or istipha dene kii dhamkee bhi de chuke hai
 According to Sumitra Singh, the issue that is being raised by Haila has been raised in the assembly decades ago, when she first became an MLA
 sumitra singh kii maane to unke dwaara uthaaya gaya mudda vidhansabha ke record main bhi darj he
 At that time the Indira Gandhi Canal was named Rajasthan Canal and excavation work was going on
 lekin jhunjhunuun ko is nahar se jodne kii koi sambhaavna nahin thi
 Significantly, the political atmosphere of Jhunjhunu district is not Congress vs BJP but Congress vs Congress
 ola kii kisi baat par bhaajapa apni pratikriya de usase pehle congress ke netaa ola ke khilaaf bol padate hai
 On the one hand, veteran Congress leader Ola and Surajgarh MLA Shravan Kumar on the other hand often discuss each other in a loud manner
 vahiin, rajya sarkaar ke mantri dow
 Rajkumar Sharma and Ola also do not hold back from spewing venom against each other on the public stage
 mantri rajendra gudha or gahalot sarkaar ke sankatmochan mantri dow
 Jitendra Singh also does not have good relations with Ola
 ola ko takreeban aadha darjan netaaon ne gher rakhaa he
 But Ola, who believes in doing something, does not leave any chance in which he does not show his opponents eyes
 ola lagaataar paanch baar saansad, aath baar vidhayak or centre or rajya sarkaar main mantri rah chuke hai
 Ola, who has reached this age of playing by playing political pieces, knows which tricks will be defeated by whom
 tabhi to ola ne haal hi main us maang (nahar) par sarkaar ko gheraa jiske mantri (nahar mantri) khud ola ke bete bijendra ola hai
 But Ola knows where the target is targeted? Will the politics going on the canal in Jhunjhunu district really quench the thirst of dozens of villages where there is no drinking water? Due to the absence of any party's interest, now the cost of the canal has increased so much that a large part of the budget is needed for this
 kya is hisse ke liye jile ke netaa or rajasthan sarkaar sahi main raajnneeti se pare jaakar ek hokar nek prayaas karegi? haa, is baat kaa sabko yakeen he ki agle chunaav main bhi nahar hi mudda rahane vaali he
 Reliance Jio gigafiber public launch time is near

 But now according to the report, the company has reduced the security deposit to Rs 2500
 philhal Jio gigafiber free he, kyonki ye testing ke daur main he
 According to the report of Telecom Talk, if the user offers a preview offer of Jio gigafiber by paying 2500 rupees, then they will be given internet at a speed of 50mbps, while those who take a connection with a security fee of Rs 4500, you will get an internet connection with 100mbps speed
 Jio gigafiber agar aap 2500 rupee de kar lenge to aapako single band wifai router diya jayega jo 2
 Supports 4ghz
 kul mila kar isse chote main istemaal kar sakate hai
 Will work well in one or two rooms
 lekin agar aap 4500 rupee dekar Jio gigafiber lete hai to aapako dual band wifi router diya jayega
 Talking about the data limit, capping 1000GB has been given in both plans
 ye data aapako ek maheene ke liye diya jaataa he
 However, there is also a fact that money is not being taken for company data under the preview offer
 yugers jo paise denge wo security diposit he yani agar aapako yuj nahin karnaa he to divaais paapas karke paise bi waapas le sakate hai
 These offers are for select users as it has not been launched commercially

 BJP MP from north-east Delhi Manoj Tiwari targeted the children of Aam Aadmi Party convenor Arvind Kejriwal during the campaign for Kachunav on Friday, saying that he hoped that he would grow up by staying away from Arvind's shadows and lies
 bhojpuri filmon ke abhinayta se netaa bane tiwari ne pichley chunaavon ke baad AAP ke congress se samarthan lene ko nishaanaa banaate hue ye baat kahi
 Addressing the rally in Azadpur, Tiwari said, 'let Arvind Kejriwal live his children

 On the first day 6 schools staged their respective plays
 drama festival kii theme 'jaldi jaldi' ke tahat skulon ne apane apane naatak prastut kiye
 a drama is composed by combining music dance and acting and that's why the schools made a very beautiful effort to put all these elements in the drama and put them on the stage
 bacchon ne naatak ke bich main dance or mujeec kii prastuti di
 The children took part and the children also looked very happy after performing the drama
 bachche apane kapade or mechap ko lekar behad extited dikhe
 According to 8-year-old Shreyasi, she does drama because she is very fond of makeup and costume

 Drama teacher at Vasant Valley School, Mohit Mukherjee said that children have more potential than elders, but children need to be very patient
 teen dinon tak chalane vaale is festival main kul 18 skool hissaa lenge jisamen se pehle din 6 skulon ne apni prastuti di or sabaki tarife batori

 jamshedpur sthit dhatkidih ke rahane vaale 16 saal ke fardin kaa shav beete 20 agast ko beldih club lake main mila tha
 Fardeen was very fond of playing games in mobile, so Fardeen's friends and family are fearing that he may have fallen victim to the 'blue Whale' game
 mili jaankaree ke anusaar, fardin 19 agast kii der raat kisi ko bataae bagaiyr ghar se nikal gaya tha
 The next day, Fardeen's family lodged a missing complaint with the police
 fardin ke pita katar main kaam karte hai
 The police were searching for Fardeen that the information was found in Beldih Lake, which stirred him up
 shav fardin kaa hi tha
 CCTV footage posted in the house showed that at around 2
30 pm, Fardeen came out of the house talking on the phone
 fardin ke doston or parijanon kii maane to padhai main kaaphi tej fardin ko mobile main game khilne kaa behad shauk tha
 This time, perhaps that reason was not good
 doston kaa yah bhi kahana he ki rigelt ko lekar vah pareshaan nahin tha
 Despite this, his death under mysterious circumstances raises many questions
 police is maamle main fardin kii aakhri lokation or kol detail khangaal rahi he
 The police is also investigating the case with a conspiracy, love affair and now the 'blue whale' game angle

 India has made great progress and its middle class has grown significantly
 lekin karodon log ab bhi bheeshan garibi main yaa phir bhayanak tangahaali main jivan guzaar rahe hai
 This is the reason why Indira's policies are still relevant and are also adopted by anti-congress like Narendra Modi (bjp's official aim is to create a 'congress-free India')
 yah is baat ko rekhaankit karne kaa vakt he ki desh ke liye indira kii nitiyon ke kya myne hai
 Policies to eradicate poverty should include measures that can meet the immediate needs of the poor
 jis desh main kisaan kheti ke liye barish par betahasha nirbhar hon, jahaan jameen ke chote-se tukade par bahut saare log nirbhar hon, vahaan ek sookhaa bhi jivan-maran kaa sawaal ban jaataa he
 a program similar to NREGA was developed by the Congress governments to learn from the mistakes made to use the labor of farmers in building a useful infrastructure
 duusari baat, rajnatik vakpatutaa main is baat kaa hameshaa dhyaan rakhaa janaa chahie ki desh main amiron se kahin zyada sankhya main garib hai
 In such a situation, even though steps should be taken to promote economic development by encouraging wider investment and construction, policy emphasis should always be on removing poverty
 indira ke liye rajvanshajon ke privi purse ko samaapt karnaa ahm faisla tha kyonki isse yah sanket gaya ki ve sampann tabakon ko unki suvidhaon se vanchit karke garibon ke liye badi ladaai ladgaye ko tatpar hai
 It was like an ointment for the deprived sections because it strengthened them psychologically
 indira kii teesri baat yah jaahir karne kii thi ki chaahe netaa ke paas jitne bhi adhikaar or shaktiyaan hon par vah ek saadhaaran jindagi jeeta ho
 Indira may have as much desire or courtesy to keep close to or show her close association with a top class intellectual, but she lived life in a very normal way and was happiest with her family, especially her grandchildren

" ye filein koyala blokon ke aavanton main hui aniyamittaaon ke aaropon ko sabit karne ke liye bahut jaruri hai

 In January, CBI officials questioned AMR director Arvind Jaiswal about his alleged links with Coal Minister Sriprakash Jaiswal and former Coal Minister Santosh Bagrodia
 sibiai nideshak kehete hai ki ve filein laapata hone or koyala mantralay kii ore se jaankariyaan nahin die jane kaa mudda baar-baar uthaate rahe
 The Supreme Court on 6 August ordered the government to cooperate in the CBI investigation and make available the documents sought by the investigating agency immediately
 ek sibiai adhikari yah shikaayat karte hai, ‘‘yah sab maamle ko halkaa karne kii mili-juli koshish kaa hissaa lagata he
 However, the CBI director believes that the case can still be saved
 sinha kehete hai, ‘‘sarkaar ne laapata filon ke bare main ab tak hamen aadhikarik rup se kuch nahin kaha he
 We will wait till the government tells us something or does not give these files in any way
 is bich ham 29 agast ko supreme court ko cese kii sthiti ke bare main jaankaree denge or agle nirdesh kaa intjaar karenge
 If the CBI did not find the missing files, then its director says that the CBI will try to reconnect the missing links based on the details of the movement of those files and other documents
 sibiai sutron kaa daawa he ki ve bhale hi filon ke mukhya hisson ko phir se sangathit kar len, ve un tippaniyon ko kabhi hasil nahin paaenge, jo kisi vishesh vyakti yaa company ke paksh main faisla karne ke liye filon main darj kii gai hongi
 The process of retrieving key parts of files will also be lengthy
 kul laapata filon main se lagbhag 150 filein 1993-2004 ke bich kii avadhi se sambandhit hai, jis dauraan 45 koyala block aavantit kiye gaye the
 The rest of the files relate to the allocations for the period 2006 to 2009 and correspondence between various ministries and states
 sibiai sutron kaa daawa he ki inke filon ke abhaav main labhaarthiyon kii ore se tathyon kii galatabayani karne or sarkaar kii ore se pakshpaat karne ke aaropon ko pusht karnaa lagbhag asambhav ho jayega
 These files contain serious documents like application forms, documents related to them, all the details of screening committee meetings, objections of officials and other records
 sibiai ke mutabik vah is baat kii jaanch ke liye taiyaar he ki kya jaan-boojhkar saboot nasht kar die gaye hai, lekin yah jaanch karne ke liye bhi yah jaruri he ki mantralay kii ore se is sambandh main ek praathmiki darj karai jaae
 When India Today contacted Coal Minister Sriprakash Jaiswal, he refused to comment, saying he would make a statement in Parliament about that
 isse pehle 20 agast ko rajyasabha main die ek bayaan main jaiswal ne kaha tha ki unhone laapata filon kaa maamla dekhne ke liye ek antar-mantralayan samiti kaa gathan kiya he
 His explanation given to a news channel is ridiculous that he could not be searched because the files were kept one above the other
 bataaya jaataa he ki koyala mantralay ke adhikari filon main yah dekhne main lage hai ki unamem kya he
 a senior leader of the opposition BJP BJP quipped, "after that we have to check the wind speed in the reserves room of the coal ministry
" mantri kahenge ki hawa bhi bahut tej he, jo filon ko gaayab kar detii he
 "at the moment there are chances that there is a possibility of the Colgate case disappearing into the air

 This indicates that this young bowler may be given a place in the team for the first ODI against Australia
 arun ne kaha, vah aisa gendbaaj he jisamen kaaphi kshamta he
 He impressed a lot in the two matches he played
 yah acha he or uskaa baayen haath kaa hona hamen atirikt phayda detaa he
 We have a player who we can refine to be a good bowler in the future
 saraan ke pehle match main khilne kii sambhaavna ke bare main poochne par coach ne kaha, agar usamen kshamta he to kyon nahin
 This is a bilateral series and we have to try our potential bowlers
 ab tak usne prabhavit kiya he

 Talking about the bowling of the team, Arun said, "spin is the strong side of India and we have had very good fast bowlers in the last few times
" hamaare paas teen se chaar gendbaaj aise hai, jo 140 kimi pratighanta se adhik kii raftaar se gendbaaji kar sakate hai, lekin aswin sambhavat: aaj vishwa kaa number ek spinner he or jadeja bhi australia main kaaphi khelaa he
 Akshar is also doing well in domestic cricket

 Something that cannot be known before and something that is not under your control
 nishchit taur par hamen unki kami khalegi
 On not using Ishant Sharma in the two warm-up matches, Arun said, he is absolutely fine
 eshanth kaaphi anbhavi gendbaaj he or agar aapane match se pehle dekha ho to vah maidan par gendbaaji kar rahaa tha
 He is throwing 25 to 30 balls on the field
 mujhe lagata he ki anya khilaadiyon ko aajmaana chahie or shami chotil ho gaya he, isliye yah adhik mahatvapurn ho gaya he ki dekhen ki agle match main koun khelegaa
 From this perspective it was important that we give the rest of the bowlers a chance

 arun shanivaar ko abhyaas match main bharat ke pradarshan se santusht hai
 India defeated Western Australia XI by 64 runs in the ODI practice match thanks to disciplined bowling after the fifties of Rohit Sharma and Manish Pandey
 team kii gendbaaji ke bare main arun ne kaha, spin bharat kaa majboot paksh he or pichley kuch samay main hamaare paas kaaphi achche tej gendbaaj rahe hai
 We have three to four bowlers who can bowl more than 140 km / h but Ashwin is probably the number one spinner in the world today and Jadeja has played a lot in Australia
 akshar bhi gharelu cricket main acha kar rahaa he
 So watch and wait
 tippaniyan Fast bowler Mohammed Shami was ruled out of the limited-overs series against Australia due to a hamstring strain, to which Arun said, "I think it's part of the game
" kuch aisa jisase pehle janaa nahin ja saktaa or kuch aisa jo aapke niyantran main nahin he
 We will surely miss them
 do abhyaas maichon main eshanth sharma kaa istemaal nahin karne par arun ne kaha, vah bilkul thik he
 Ishant is a very experienced bowler and if you have seen before the match, he was bowling on the field
 vah maidan par 25 se 30 gend phenk rahaa he
 i think other players should try and Shami gets injured so it becomes more important to see who will play in the next match
 is najariye se yah mahatvapurn tha ki ham baaki gendbaajon ko mauka den

 bharat ke log ek aise loktantr main rahete hai, jiske bare main bhavishyavaanee kii ja sakati he
 You may not be able to tell who will win the next election but there is no doubt about the next election
 pakistan ke log loktantr ke intensive care unit (isiu) main rahete hai-bhale hi use jinda rakhane vaale saare mukhya ang thik-thaak kaam kar rahe hon, lekin yah pataa nahin hota ki ve kab tak sahi rah paaenge
 There are only a few days left for general elections to be held in Pakistan, but many still doubt whether these elections will be conducted according to their schedule
 30 april, 2013 kii shaam pakistan ke sena pramukh general parvej kayaani ne jo bhaashan diya, vah pakistan ke loktantr kii kamajori ko hi darshata he
 Just 11 days before the election, General Kayani in his speech assured the people of Pakistan that elections will be held and democracy is not threatened by the army of the country
 sach kahen to is tarah ke aashwaasan sunne main achche lagate hai, lekin ve pakistan main badlaav kii aitihaasik paripati ko bhi darshaate hai
 As the election campaign is reaching its peak, the tehrik-e-taliban Pakistan (TTP) or the Taliban of Pakistan are based on the Awami National Party (ANP), Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) and Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP)
 The attack is intensifying
 iske saath hi is bare main bhi aspashtataa bani hui he ki pakistani loktantr chaupat hoti arthvyavastha, kshetreey jatiltaaon or gharelu atvaad kii chunautiyon kaa saamana kis tarah kar paaegaa
 The truth is that such assurances are being given, they only indicate nervousness about the stability of democracy
 rashtriya maamalon main sena kii aawaaj ab bhi taqatvar he, is bare main kisi tarah ke shaq kii gunjaaish nahin he
 The question is whether this voice is as powerful as it always was
 yahaan kahani mjedaar ho jaati he
 Since 2008, General Kayani and the army high command have taken a soft and behind-the-scenes approach and are not directly interfering in national affairs
 america ke saath milakar hastkshep karne or afghanistan seemaa se lage duurand rekha par apni sthiti majboot karne ko chhodkar zyaadaatar samay ve tamashbin bane rahe
 This new attitude can be attributed to General Kayani to some extent
 pakistan main loktantr isliye nahin tikaa rahaa ki sena sudhar gai he, balki rashtriya sansthaaon ke nae sanskarnon ke kaaran aisa hua he
 She is no longer bowing down to the Pakistani military rulers, as she used to bow before
 in sansthaaon main sabase aage hai nyaaypalika or rashtriya media
 The best view of the new appearance of these institutions is found in the return of General Pervez Musharraf to Pakistan
 musharraf ne sena pramukh, chif agxcutive or phir raashtrapati ke rup main apane lambey kaarykaal (1998 se 2007) ke dauraan chatukaaron kii jo fouj taiyaar kii thi, uske bal par ve khud ko mahaan hasti maanane lage the
 The one who kept the illusion of victory in Kargil, who ousted Nawaz Sharif's elected government
 sharif ne pakistaniyon ko mobile phone, internet ke istemaal or vibhinn chounalon ko dekhne kii aazaadee di thi
 Musharraf believes that the people of Pakistan are longing for a return to the glorious days of 2005, when in conversation with the Washington Post, he boasted, "many people say if you want to go abroad and go to Canada
" If you want a visa or citizenship and want to become a millionaire, then get yourself raped; "or after this infamous statement, he has a fur with John Stewart on a channel called Comedy Central Zee show had appeared on The Daily Show
 lekin in baton kii bhi ek seemaa hoti he
 By the time Musharraf was finishing his tour of the promotion of his pseudo-written book, most Pakistanis had decided that his time was now over
 jab unhone march, 2007 menkuch samay ke liye chif justise iftikhar choudhary ko barkhaast karne kii koshish kii thi to unke liye badi vikat sthit paidaa ho gai thi or badi sankhya main log unke khilaaf ho gaye the
 Only then did the end of Musharraf's phase come to a close and the only question remained was when would it end
 pakistan main musharraf ke daur kaa ant hone kaa kaaran yah tha ki nyaaypalika or kanoonee birdari ne ek vardidhari general ke dambh ke khilaaf khadey hone kaa faisla kar liya tha
 The General's best days were over
 musharraf ne pakistan lautakar paaya ki na sirf nyaaypalika pehle se zyada majboot ho chuki he, balki unhone yah bhi dekha ki pakistan main sena pramukh rahane ke dauraan jo log unke kareebi dost ban gaye the, ve unke sattavihin hote hi usee teji se nadaarad ho gaye, jis teji se ve prakat hue the
 It has become more difficult today for a general to gain public support while in Pakistan or after retiring
 pakistan kii janata ke jehan main yah sena kii chhavi kharaab hone kaa saboot nahin he, balki yah pakistan main nai nyaaypalika or nai media ke ubhaar kaa sanket he
 Today's judiciary has made its special place among the people of Pakistan through deliberate judicial intervention
 nyaaypalika ke is tarah ke hastkshep ko aam taur par sangyaan lenaa kaha jaataa he
 This same image of the judiciary has given judges the ability to challenge the legislature and branches of the executive and summon both powerful generals and television's rockstar anchors in courts where they have to respond to the law
 loktantr behaal karne ke liye adaalat kii yah sakriyata mulk ke logon ko acchhee lag rahi he
 It is also true that in a society where there are at least as many saints as sinners, the judiciary is not untouched by the diseases spread in the society
 bhai-bhatijawad, bhrashtachar, janhit ke naam par dhaandhlee jaisi bimaariyaan aaj bhi pakistan kii nyaaypalika kaa hissaa hai
 In spite of all this, the judiciary in Pakistan handles cases without interference from outside forces or censor
 is prakaar yah swaabhaavik hi he ki pakistan lautne kii galat salaah ne musharraf ko jail pahunchaa diya he, or unke khilaaf kai mukademe chal rahe hai
 Not only this, he has also been denied to contest elections, for which he came back
 pakistan kii nyaaypalika main is tarah kii sakhti pakistani samachar madhyamon ke saahas ke bina sambhav nahin thi
 Pakistani journalists have prepared an open and honest dialogue about the importance of various institutions
 iske saath hi unhone apni seemaa main sena ke dakhal ko rokane kaa saahas bhi dikhaaya he
 The freedom gained by a commentator like me is a result of the enormous sacrifices of journalists
 unhone sarkaar ke us dhaanche kaa jamkar virodh kiya he, jisamen soochna par ankush lagane kii koshish kii jaati rahi he or duusari taraf soochna par kathor niyantran rakhane kii ichha rakhane vaale aatankwaadiyon kii badhati takat ke aage na jhukne kaa bhi saahas dikhaaya he
 There is speculation that Musharraf will be quietly flown out of the country
 mana ja rahaa he ki is yojana ke peeche sena kaa haath he
 But where Musharraf will go is a secondary question of the process in which a former Pakistan army chief has been summoned to court, detained, deprived of government posts and completely humiliated
 has been done
 ab pakistan main, sabase taqatvar, logon ko pakistan ke loktantr main gaiyr-kanoonee dakhlandajiyon ke sambhavit nateezon ke bare main gambhirtha se sochane ke liye majaboor hona padegaa, bhale hi yah loktantr abhi chaahe jitna kamjor kyon na najar aa rahaa ho
 Its weakness and uncertainty about the state of democracy is an important question
 ek naagarik sarkaar se duusari sarkaar ke bich sankraman swaagatyogy he
 But along with this, many things also need to be considered
 pakistan abhi aadim samay se baahar nahin aayaa he
 And we are certainly far away from the strong tradition of democracy, but in a short span of a few weeks a lot is happening in Pakistan, which has never happened before
 yahaan ek purv sena pramukh ko jail kii sajaa ho gai
 In a few days elections are going to be held to replace another government there
 ho saktaa he jaldi hi ek din pakistan apni aarthik, kshetreey or suraksha kii chunautiyon kaa saamana karne main safal ho jaae
 Who knows what the future of Pakistan's democracy is going to be? After all, unlike Indian democracy, we are just getting started
 jaidi pakistan main rahane vaale raajnneetik vishleshak or tippaneekar hai Launching the yatra for the sixth time in the last 21 years, senior BJP leader LK Advani strongly called for a change in both the system and the leadership in the country, strongly raising the issue of scams and black money stashed abroad

 adwani kii is rath yatra ko bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne hari jhandi dikhaakar ravaanaa kiya
 Everyone needs good governance: Advani | LIVE TV Advani said, 'I will also mention the flaws of my party
 agar kisi tarah kaa bhrashtachar meri party main he to main ise bhi samaapt karuunga
 Advani, however, did not fully explain the situation on the subject whether he considered himself a prime ministerial candidate or not

 Advani's Jan Chetna Yatra begins | Watch video: Advani said, 'many scams have been exposed one after another during the tenure of the present government of the Center, which has created resentment against corruption in the minds of the people
 log ab bhrashtachar bardaasht karnaa nahin chaahate he

"

 Corruption should be eliminated from this country
 iske liye keval netritv main hi badlaav kii jarurat nahin he balki vyavastha main bhi badlaav kii jarurat he
 "life of Advani in pictures
 Advani's Rath Yatra" Advani said that such visits bring consciousness to the nation
 is prakaar kii yatraaon kaa desh main mahatvapurn yogadan hota he
 The purpose of this visit is good governance and clean politics
 iske alaava lokapal ore videshon main jamaa kalaadhan waapas laane kaa mudda bhi ahm he
 Advani will visit 7,600 km during his Jan Chetna Yatra and the journey will end in Delhi
 is dauraan vah 100 jilon kii yatra karenge
 He said that this was what Lok Nayak Jayaprakash Narayan did and he is also working to awaken the nation
 adwani ne janmabhumi dooshit kiah lalu |rathyatripani purv kii ramajnmabhumi yatra ko yaad karte hue unhone kaha, yah in yatraaon kaa hi yogadan he ki jahaan ek samay bihar kii dharti par samastipur main meri yatra roki gayi thi vahiin usee dharti par vartmaan sarkaar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar is yatra ko hari jhandi dikhaa rahe he
 Advani said, “JP instilled a sense of patriotism among the people in the 70s and instilled confidence in democracy
 ghotaalon or bhrashtachar ke kaaran loktantr main bharosa kam hua he, jise behaal karne ke liye maine yatra shuru kii he
 Earlier, Advani launched the Janchetna Yatra from Sitab Diyara of Jaiprakash Narayan's birthplace Saran on the occasion of Loknayak's birth anniversary
 sitab diyaara ke samaaroh ke baad hawaldda maidan main nitish kumaar ne hari jhandi dikhaakar janchetana yatra ‘rath’ ko ravaanaa kiya, jo bihar sahit 23 rajyon or chaar centre shasit pradeshon se gujaregaa
 Advani said that there has been a decline in current politics and public confidence in political parties has decreased, which has become a cause for concern
 adwani ne kaha, ‘keval congress ko hi dosha nahin diya ja saktaa he balki bhaajapa main bhi main kai kamiyaan nikaalata rahata hum
 Every citizen of the country will have to perform duty, only then the country will develop
 ’ bihar main rajg sarkaar kii tarif karte hue bhaajapa ke varisht netaa ne kaha, ‘nitish kumaar apni himmat or samajhadaari se sarkaar chalaa rahe hai
 Nitish Kumar while addressing this gathering said, "the Jan Chetna Yatra against corruption, inflation and black money is welcome
 kuch log hai, jo yatra ko duusare makasad se dekh rahe hai
 How did the campaign against corruption become communal? yah samaj se pare he
 Hitting indirectly at the former Bihar Chief Minister Lalu Prasad, he said, 'people doing the Pangea Panth and Tantra mantras teach us the lesson of secularism
 isse satta milane vaali hoti to log pradhanmantri ban jate 
 There is no need to go to the public
 ’ nitish ne kaha, ‘daal main kuch kaala na ho to darane kii jarurat kya he ? bhrashtachar ke khilaaf abhiyaan main darane kii jarurat nahin hai
 The meeting was addressed by senior leaders including Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Sushma Swaraj, Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Arun Jaitley, BJP General Secretary Anant Kumar
 baharhaal, rashtriya janata dal ke rashtriya adhyaksh lalu prasad ne aaj daawa kiya ki bhaajapa netaa laal krishna adwani kaa abhinandan karne vaale bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar kii sarkaar ab jane vaali he
 Addressing the public meeting, Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Sushma Swaraj said that due to corruption people have lost faith in political leaders
 jan chetana yatra ke sanyojak anant kumaar ne kaha ki jaiprakash narayan ke baad adwani ke netritv main duusari sampoorn kranti shuru hui he jo desh ko bhrashtachar se mukt banane ke liye he
 Earlier, Advani, along with his daughter Pratibha, besides Sushma Swaraj, Arun Jaitley and other leaders visited the late Samajwadi leader's native place and paid floral tributes to him
 adwani ne apni pehle kii yatra ko bhi yaad kiya or us samay rajya ke mukhyamantri lalu prasad ke aadesh par samastipur se apni giraftaar kaa zikr kiya
 On this occasion, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar said without naming Lalu Prasad that some people are calling the Jan Chetna Yatra against corruption as communal
 unhone kaha, ‘unhone yatra ko hari jhandi dikhaane par meri dharmanirpeksh chhavi par bhi sawaal kiya he
 They should know that this is a journey against corruption which people will not tolerate anymore

 punjab ke cabinet mantri or varisht congress netaa trupt rajinder singh bajva ne navjot singh siddhu par nishaanaa saadhaa he
 He has advised Sidhu to resign from the Punjab cabinet
 bajva ne shanivaar ko kaha ki yah baat bilkul saaf he ki punjab main hamaare leader, hamaari party ke leader siem captain amarinder singh hi hai, lekin agar siddhu unhen apana netaa nahin maanate yaa khud ko unase bada maanate hai to unhen cabinet se istipha de dena chahie
 Bajwa said that whatever responsibility Rahul Gandhi assigns to Sidhu, he should fulfill it
 bajva ne navjot singh siddhu ko kam bolne or kaam zyada karne kii naseehat bhi di or kaha ki vah dhire dhire chalem
 He may have said that his (navjot Singh Sidhu) dreams are big, but they will come true only when Vad will pay attention to his words and walk at a low speed
 bajva ne kaha, 'yah sabko pataa he ki mere, captain amarinder singh, siddhu ke or puri congress party ke captain rahul gandhi hi hai
 But Captain Amarinder Singh is the leader of Congress and government in Punjab and will remain
 ' unhone kaha ki jis tarah ke atitude or body language ke saath navjot singh siddhu ne captain amarinder singh ko apana captain na maanane kii baat kahi he, vaise main unhen cabinet ko chhod dena chahie
 Significantly, on the issue of going to Pakistan in the foundation stone program of Kartarpur Sahib Corridor, Navjot Singh Sidhu in Bengaluru said on Friday that he was sent by Rahul Gandhi to Pakistan
 unhone kaha, 'mere captain rahul gandhi hai, unhone hi bheja he har jagah
 Sidhu said that Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh forbade me to go to Pakistan
 lekin kareeb 20 congressi netaaon or kendriya netritv ke kehane par main pakistan gaya tha
 The CM of Punjab is like my father
 main unase pehle hi bataa chukaa tha ki main pakistan jaaoongaa
 My captain is Rahul Gandhi and the captain of CM is also Rahul Gandhi

 desh main tex kii dar ab duniya ke vibhinn deshon kii tulana main pratispardhaatmak he, aise main nae nivesh kii ummid bhi jagati he
 But this is the ideal situation
 companiyon ne jiesti kii raahat bhi graahakon tak pahunchaai thi yaa nahin is par hi jaanch chal rahi he to ye raahat graahakon yaa arthvyavastha tak pahonchegi isaki nigaraanee koun karegaa or kaise hogi?khapat badhaane ke liye sarkaar zyada se zyada saste karj kii vyavastha kar sakati he
 The price of products can be reduced by reducing the tax rate
 in donon hi morchon par sarkaar ne kuch kadam uthaae hai
 RBI has cut the policy rates by 110 basis points
 daron main katautee graahakon tak pahunche isaki vyavastha karj kii daron ko bahari benchmark se jodne kii shuruyaat ke saath kii ja chuki he
 GST Council meetings continue to reduce tax on products and services from time to time
 jidipi main khapat, sarkari kharch or nijee kharch yahi teen pahie hai
 Efforts are being made to increase consumption
 nijee kharch bade iskaa rasta tex main katautee se saath nikaala gaya
 Government has assured that there will be no reduction in government expenditure
 to kya maan len ki diwali ke baad kii timahi se desh kii aarthik vikaas main sudhaar ke sanket milane lagenge?mere hisaab se bachat or rojgaar do aise morche hai jahaan abhi sarkaar ko or prayaas karne kii jarurat he
 Some big announcements should be made to encourage savings and to increase employment, the government should start investing without delay
 kyonki aay badhane par hi kharch badhegaa or bhavishya ke prati ashanvit hone par hi lakhon kii kist bandhavane kii himmat aegi
 It may be that increasing indiscriminate spending makes it difficult to maintain the discipline of fiscal deficit, but we must not forget that we are not the only country in the world to suffer from recession
 ghate ke baad global agenciyaan kya karengi?sarkaar ke karj lene ke baad mahangaai kitni badhegi? is baton kii chintaa ek do saal chhod deni chahie
 Because even during the recession of 2008-2009, these figures were not very influential
 khapat sudharegi, bachat or nivesh badhegaa to gaadi khud-va-khud patari par laut aegi

 Whether a Naxalite or an active terrorist in Kashmir
 modi sarkaar suraksha se judi chunautiyon ke saath majbootee se nipategi
 BJP National President Amit Shah has given this assurance
 ajtak ke saath exclusive intervyuu main unhone emsidi chunaav se lekar yogi sarkaar ke kaamkaaj or pashchim bengal jaise rajyon main party kii muhim par bebaak baatcheet kii
 This was his first interview after the MCD elections and the Naxalite attack in Sukma
 'haath se nahin jaane denge kashmir'shah ne media ke kuch halkon main kashmir ko lekar jataai ja rahi chintaa ko khaarij kiya
 The BJP president said that no matter what government remains, no power can separate Kashmir from India
 unki raay main ghati main maujuuda hinsa mahaj ek phej he or sarkaar sabake sahyog se is phej se kashmir ko baahar le aegi
 According to Shah, this is not the right time to review the alliance with PDP in the state and the Modi government is also making diplomatic efforts to improve the situation
 'baukhalaahat kaa nateeja he sukama hamalaa'amit shah kii raay main chhattisgarh ke sukama main siarpief javaanon par hua hamalaa naksaliyon kii baukhalaahat kaa nateeja he
 He claimed that after the Modi government came, pressure has increased on the left wing extremists and such attacks are a response to this pressure
 shah ne bharosa dilaayaa ki javaanon kii shahadat bekaar nahin jaaegi
 'accept defeat Kejriwal' During the interview, Amit Shah also spoke on the MCD election results
 unhone yaad dilaayaa ki 2015 main kejariwal kii jeet par unhone khud badhai di thi or ab aam aadmi party ko bhi haar sweekaar kerani chahie
 Shah also dismissed Kejriwal's allegation of disturbances in evms
 unka maananaa he ki nakaaratmak siyasat ke chalate kejariwal ko haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa he
 He said, 'I want to remind Kejriwal
 wo kehete the rhite tu ricol hona chahie
 The people of Delhi have given the message of Right to Recall
 ab kejariwal ko sochna he
 Shah claimed that the Aam Aadmi Party is a victim of internal divisions
 lekin saath hi kaha ki bijepi kejariwal kii party ko todane kii koshish nahin kar rahi he
 He also praised party president Manoj Tiwari in Delhi
 lekin kya wo agle vidhansabha chunaav main party ke siem ummidavaar honge, is sawaal ko wo taal gaye
 Praising the Yogi government, he said that the Yogi government is doing a good job after coming to power
 haalanki unhone mana ki sarkaar ke saamne kathin chunautiyaan hai
 He hoped that the efforts of the Yogi government would yield good results
 'sabhi gorakshak nahin hamaare kaaryakarta'amit shah ne bharosa dilaayaa ki sarkaar goraksha ke naam par ho rahi hinsa par jald kaabo paaegi
 According to him, these elements are there in every society and it is not necessary that every such person is a part of BJP or its associated organizations
 'tripal talaak par saaf rukh'shah kaa kahana tha ki teen talaak par party or sarkaar kaa rukh he
 The BJP wants that Muslim women should get the rights given in the Constitution
 2019 main jeet kaa bharosiumit shah ne mana ki agle aam chunaav ke liye vipakshi partiyaan saath aane kii koshish kar rahi hai
 Therefore, this challenge will not be easy for the party
 lekin unhone bharosa jataayaa ki modi ke kaam kii badaulat 2019 main koi satta-virdohi lahar nahin hogi

 bhansaali ke saath badasluki se naaraaz film jagat ke logon ne hamale ke doshiyon ke khilaaf kadi karrwai kii maang kii he
 Let us tell you that during the shooting of Padmavati in Jaipur's Jaigad Fort, Rajput Karni Sena on Friday raped Bhansali on the sets
 karani sena kaa kahana he ki ve aitisahik tathyon ko tod-marodakar pesh kiye jane kaa virodh kar rahe hai
 Narendra Kumar, in-charge of Amer police station, said, "the filmmaker has stopped shooting at Jaigad Fort and the film's team has left that place
 ’’ film nirmaan se jude ek sutara ne kaha, ‘‘film nirmaataaon ne pehle hi saaf kar diya he ki rani padmavati or allaudin khilji ke paatro ke bich aisa koi drishy nahin he
 Bhansali has shot his films in Rajasthan in the past, but he never faced any problems
 jo kuch hua durbhagyapurna tha or team apana saamaan baandh rahi he
 People from an organization of Rajput community had indulged in indecency with Bhansali yesterday and also stopped shooting by vandalizing the film's set at Jaigad Fort
 in logon kaa aarope tha ki bhansaali apni film main allaudin khilji or rani padmavati ke bare main tathyon ko tod-marodakar pesh kar rahe hai
 Lokendra Singh Kalvi, the founder of the organization said in a press conference, "I do not support any violence
 karani sena vahaan shooting kaa virodh karne or bhansaali se baat karne gai thi
 But he refused to meet, and his security personnel fired three bullets into the air, which led to a provocation
 ’’ kaalvi ne kaha ki unhone shooting se chah maheene pehle hi film ko lekar apni aapatti vyakt kar di thi
 He came to know about the film's scenes through an interview with film actor Ranveer Singh
 bhansaali ne is mudde par saarvajanik taur par koi bayaan nahin diya lekin film main kaam kar rahe kalakaaron ranvir, deepika padukon or shahid kapur samet film jagat ke logon ne is ghatana ke liye sanghathan kii ninda kii
 Deepika, who is playing the role of Padmavati, tweeted, "am shocked"
 kal kii ghatana ke bare main jaanakar bahut dukh hua
 The actress assured that the film's team did not tamper with any historical facts and the team's goal was to bring the story of "courageous and powerful" Padmavati to the screen
 ek anya twit main deepika ne kaha, ‘‘padmavati ke taur par main aapako bharosa de sakati hum ki itihaas se kisi bhi tarah kii chhedchhad nahin kii gai he
 "he wrote," Our only effort is and will be that the story of this courageous and powerful woman be shared with the world as radically as possible
 ’’ film main allaudin khilji kii bhoomika nibhaa rahe 31 varshiya ranvir ne kaha ki unki manshaa kisi kii bhaawanaaon ko thes pahunchane kii nahin thi
 He said that what happened is very unfortunate
 mujhe ummid he ki rajasthan ke log hamaari manshaa ko samajhenge or sahanubhuti dikhaate hue hamaara saath denge
 Like a team, while making 'padmavati', we are taking care of the sentiments and sentiments of the people of Rajasthan and the Rajput community
 unhone twit kiya, ‘‘sanjay sar bharat ke sabase daksh or pramanik film nirmaataaon main se ek hai or ham aisa kuch bhi nahin karenge jisase kisi kii bhavanaaen aahat hon
 Shahid Kapoor, who plays Raja Ratan Singh in the film, also condemned the attack on Bhansali, saying the violence was "unacceptable"
 tippaniyan Senior scriptwriter Salim Khan has also described the attack on Bhansali as a matter of shame
 bollywood ko ‘‘sholay’’ jaisi film kii kahani dene vaale 81 varshiya saleem khan ne kaha ki unke kai rajput dost hai lekin kabhi kisi ke saath aisa nahin laga
 He said, "I have grown up with Rajput boys and have been close to their family
 ye log anuvaanshik rup se bahadur, dildaar or vafaadaar hote hai
 Those who attacked Sanjay Leela Bhansali were calling themselves Rajputs
 ye is bhadra samudaay ke liye shame kii baat he
 '' amer thane ke prabharee narendra kumaar ne kaha, "filmkaar ne jaigarh kile main shooting roak di he or film kii team us jagah se ja chuki he
 "the filmmakers have already made it clear that there is no such scene between the characters of Rani Padmavati and Alauddin Khilji," a source associated with filmmaking said
 bhansaali ne pehle bhi rajasthan main apni filmon kii shooting kii he lekin unhen kabhi koi dikkat nahin ai
 Whatever happened was unfortunate and the team is packing their belongings
 ’’ rajput samudaay ke ek sanghathan ke logon ne kal bhansaali ke saath abhadrata kii thi or jaigarh fort main film ke set par todphod karke shooting bhi roak di
 These people had alleged that Bhansali was distorting the facts about Alauddin Khilji and Rani Padmavati in his film
 sanghathan ke sansthaapak lokentre singh kaalvi ne ek samvaadadaata sammelan main kaha, ‘‘main kisi hinsa kaa samarthan nahin karata
 Karni Sena went there to protest the shooting and talk to Bhansali
 lekin unhone milane se manaa kar diya or unke surakshakarmiyon ne hawa main teen goliyaan daagin jiske baad uksaave kii sthiti bani
 Kalvi said that he had expressed his reservations about the film six months before the shooting
 unhen film abhinayta ranvir singh ke saakshaatkaar ke madhyam se film ke drishyon ke bare main pataa chalaa tha
 Bhansali did not publicly give a statement on the issue but filmgoers including Ranveer, Deepika Padukone and Shahid Kapoor, working in the film, condemned the organization for the incident
 padmavati kii bhoomika adaa kar raheen deepika ne twit kiya, ‘‘stabdh hum
 Very sad to know about yesterday's incident
 ’’ abhinetri ne bharosa diya ki film kii team ne kisi bhi aitihaasik tathy se chhedchhad nahin kii or team kaa lakshya screen par ‘‘saahsee or shaktishaalee’’ padmavati kii kahani laana tha

 ) Film Name: ABCD 2 (any Body Can Dance -2) Director: Remo d Souzastar Cast: Varun Dhawan, Shraddha Kapoor, Prabhu Deva Duration: 154 minutes Certificates: u Rating: 2 Remo d Souza's debut as a director director was given to ABCD by the audience
 It was well appreciated and Remo has tried to make ABCD 2 (any Body Can Dance-2) this time by moving the same installment
 is baar star cast menvarun dhawan or shraddha kapoorki maujuudagi he or film 3 di main bhi banaayi gai he
 Has Remo completely touched the audience this time too, let's review the film-this is a story based on real-life events of the dance troupe of the small town of Mumbai, 'nalasopara', whose dream is to reach great heights and Wash off the stain on you
 jiske liye suresh (varun dhawan) or uske saathi bharsak prayaas karte hai
 Vinny (shraddha Kapoor) also plays an important role in this and Vishnu Sir (prabhu Deva) is the teacher of this entire group
 imoshan, drama, or super dance karte hue aakhirkaar tipical indian filmon jaise is film ko anjaam miltaa he
 This is a better film in the films based on script, acting and dance
 kahani main kuch bhi nayaa nahin he, lekin dance behtareen he
 The duration of the film is more than two and a half hours, which starts to bore after a while
 lekin film kaa 3 di effect laajawab he jisaki vajah se film ek vijual treet he
 Due to the characters, there is an attempt to do emotional but you are not able to get emotional
 rishton kaa taana bana bhi dikhaaya gaya he or harek baat main kuch naa kuch kami jhalkati he
 The film's love angle also looks a bit incomplete
 kuch geet aise bhi the jinka mere hisaab se hona jaruri nahin tha wo bevajaah vakt or screenple le jate hai
 Dance is a film based on competition but it could be cut short and crisp
 varun dhawan or shraddha ke saath saath screen par aae harek actor ne bakhub abhinay kiya he
 You will never see Varun dancing like this and seeing this form of reverence you can say that he is also a great dancer
 prabhu deva kii entry to gajab hoti he lekin mere hisaab se unhen zyada prayog main laayaa ja saktaa tha
 If there is a film based on music and dance, then of course songs are bound to be laughable but as i said earlier if there were few songs, the film would have looked more interesting
 ye geet tivi radio or internet par sunate vakt to kaaphi achche lagate hai lekin film main inkaa prabhaav thodaa feekaa sa lagata he
 Why see - If you are interested in dance, Varun, Shraddha, Remo and Prabhu Deva's fans, then you must watch this film
 kyon naa dekhen-agar aap kisi nai tarah kii kahani kii talash main hai, to yah film aapke liye nahin bani he
 It is a very big film which gets tired after a time
