 But there is one such IPS officer of Bihar cadre after whom an intersection is being named
 ye ipies afasar hai vikaas vaibhav
 This intersection is in Bagaha of West Champaran but these IPS officers are still posted as digs of Bhagalpur range
 2003 batch ke ipies afasar vikaas vaibhav jab 2007 main bagaha ke espi hua karte the or us samay us ilaake ke liye jo kaam kiya usko yaad karte hue aaj 10 varshon ke baad unke naam par chauraahey kaa naam rakhaa ja rahaa he
 The program for this is being organized on Friday, 1 September
 bagaha ke samarkola gaanv ke bich ek chauraahaa he jiskaa naam ab vikaas vaibhav chauraahaa hoga
 People will now know this intersection by the same name
 2007 main jab vikaas vaibhav bagaha ke espi banakar aaye the tab is ilaake kochamparan kaa chambalkaha jaataa tha
 This crossroads then became deserted and a den of criminals
 log din main bhi udhar se guzarane se darate the
 Gajendra Yadav of the same area, who was very conscious about the environment, started planting saplings in that intersection and surrounding areas
 gajendra yadav ne tatkaaleen espi vikaas vaibhav se milakar us chauraahey kii samasya bataai or kaha ki aparaadhiyon kii vajah se vahaan se guzarana bhi mushkil ho gaya he
 The SP, conscious of its duty, immediately took action and not only freed that intersection from criminals but also encouraged Gajendra Yadav to plant more trees
 yahaan 7 lakh ped lag chuke hai
 Today this area is Gulzar
 dukaane saj gai hai
 Tree plants grew and took the form of a beautiful market
 vikaas vaibhav kii vajah se ab din main kya, der raat tak dukaane khuli rahati hai
 There is also outside and business here

 Vikas Vaibhav not only freed Bagaha from his crimes but also did many things for the society
 yahi vajah thi unka transfer hone par bagaha ke logon ne andolan kiya tha
 That is, even today the people of Bagaha remember that SP, whose name is Vikas Vaibhav

 chote chote shaharon main bhi prayogshaalaayein banani chahie taaki utpaadon kii jaanch aasaani se or jaldi ho sake
 The most important thing is to keep the international standards in mind, their corresponding standards should be set so that the products going out of the country can meet the standards there

 The revolver is known today as the smallest and most effective weapon of death, but very few people know that Samuel Colt, who designed this dangerous weapon, was born on July 19 in 1814
 1
 It was named Revolver because of the rotating cylinder in it
 2
 During the Mexican War in 1846, the US government placed orders for 1000 Colt Revolvers
 3
 Before this only one and two barrel flintlock pistol existed
 4
 The idea of making the colt a revolver came from seeing an anchor winch in the sea
 5
 In the year 1856, Colt's company produced 150 weapons daily

 As soon as the assembly elections were announced in Delhi on February 7, the political fervor has intensified
 in chunaavon ko aam aadmi party(aap) ke sanyojak arvind kejariwal or bijepi kaa netritv karne vaale pradhanmantri narendra modi se sidhe taur par jodakar dekha ja rahaa he
 In the 2013 assembly elections, BJP has suffered the expense of undermining Arvind Kejriwal by staying away from power in Delhi
 jabaki 2013 main vidhansabha chunaavon main bijepi sabase badi party ke taur par ubhari thi
 Know further why Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party remains a cause of fear for PM Modi in the Delhi Assembly elections
 ye hai wo 7 vajah jiske chalate 'aap' se darate hai piem modi1
 The Aam Aadmi Party is going to fight in Delhi elections under the leadership of Arvind Kejriwal
 dilli ke log ab bhi kejariwal ko 'badlaav kaa cheharaa' maanate hai
 In the 2013 assembly elections, the BJP introduced Dr
 Harsh Vardhan as the chief ministerial face of the party but in these elections the BJP has not yet found a leader to contest Kejriwal
 2
 AAP has been looking ready for the Delhi Assembly elections for quite some time
 party ne 70 siton par apane ummidavaaron kaa pehle hi elaan kar diya he
 After the defeat in the Lok Sabha elections, the AAP focused on the Delhi elections instead of contesting the Haryana and Maharashtra elections
 lekin iske ulat bijepi har chunaav lard rahi he or bijepi ab chunaav kii tarikhon ke elaan ke baad ummidavaar tay nahin kar paa rahi he
 3
 bijepi 'aap' ko in vidhansabha chunaavon main halke main nahin le sakati he
 Although the BJP did very well in Delhi in the Lok Sabha elections, the Aam Aadmi Party stood second in almost all the seats
 duusari vajah ye bhi he ki 'aap' kii chhavi dilli main badlaav se jodakar dekhi jaati he
 4
 sirf 49 din kii sarkaar ke baad kejariwal ke istipha dene se logon main gussa to tha, lekin iske baavjood bhi loksabhaa chunaav main aam aadmi party kaa vot fisad badha he
 BJP got 33 percent votes in the assembly elections, while in the Lok Sabha elections the party got 46 percent votes
 iske vipareet aam aadmi party ko vidhansabha chunaav ke 29 fisadi kii tulana main loksabhaa chunaavon main 33 fisadi vot mili the
 5
 dilli ke jhuggi jhopadi ilaake main rahane vaale log arvind kegerinvaal kaa samarthan kar sakate hai
 Apart from this, AAP is still popular among young voters
 2013 vidhansabha chunaav main 'aap' ne 28 siten jiti thim jabaki 19 siton par party duusare number par rahi
 AAP lost about 4 thousand votes in about 8 seats in Delhi
 6
 Both Modi and Kejriwal deliver wonderful speeches
 donon hi netaa aam aadmi or bhrashtachar ke khilaaf baat karte hai
 If we talk only about corruption, then the image of the two leaders is clear among the common man
 loksabhaa chunaav main logon ne vikaas kii sambhaavnaaon ke maddenjar modi ko vot diya tha
 In such a situation, he can vote for Kejriwal in the Delhi Assembly elections
 7
 Aam Aadmi Party is considered very strong on social media
 piem modi kii tarah arvind kejariwal ke bhi twitor, fasebuk par active folbers hai
 Being more active on social media, 'AAP' can woo bjp's young voters
 aaj kaldesh main dharm parivartan kii laharsi chal rahi he
 Many people have 'returned home' and many are preparing for 'homecoming'
 gajab kaa utsaah he dharm parivartan karaane waalon main
 By the way, those who change religion are also not behind
 ek majahabi thekedaar cheekh-cheekh kar elaan kar rahe hai ki bharat ko 2021 tak hindu raashtra bana denge
 Hinduist organizations have called it 'homecoming' rather than 'conversion'
 sardi ke is mausam main dharm parivartan ke mudde par sansad bhi garm he
 There is a tussle between the government and the opposition in both houses on this issue
 kehane vaale kah rahe hai ki dharm parivartan karaane ke maamle main sangh or hinduvadi sanghathanon kaa utsaah kendra main bijepi sarkaar aane ke baad doguna ho gaya he
 This is the reason that there are reports of 'homecoming' coming from many places
 ab sawaal ye he ki 'ghar vaapasi' karne vaale ye log hai koun? or wo kyon majahab badal rahe hai? kai logon kaa kahana he ki unhen is kaam ke badale ek badi rakam di ja rahi he or kuch kaa kahana he ki daraa dhamka kar aisa kiya ja rahaa he
 In fact, those who come to the 'homecoming' are slum dwellers who can do anything to feed themselves and their families
 gandi bastiyon main kachare ke saath jindagi bitaane vaale ye log sharnaarthi hai to kuch duusare rajyon se palaayan kar aae majdoor
 Some beggars and some garbage pickers
 do vakt kii roti hi inhe is tarah ke kaam ke liye majaboor karti he
 In such a situation, if an offer like 'return home' comes, in which neither hard work nor any trouble, instead of meeting the needs, then what is the harm? The reality is that these people have no 'home'
 to phir ghar vaapasi kisi? lekin sawaal par sawaal ye he ki kya inaki majaburi kaa phayda uthaane waalon kaa ye kadam jaij he? The Uttar Pradesh government has proposed an amendment to the Criminal Procedure Code (CRPC) to expedite the disposal of rape cases and to make the bail rules tougher in such cases
 rajya vidhansabha main aaj pesh kiye gaye dand prakriya samhita (uttar pradesh dwitiya sanshodhan) vidheyak main nyaayik pareekshan tathaa jamaanat sambandhi kuch nai dharaaen or upadharaayein prastaavit kii gai hai
 The proposed bill proposes a section under which the concerned judge will have to settle the rape case under Section 376 of the Indian Penal Act within six months
 ek anya up dhara kaa prastaav bhi kiya gaya he jisamen kaha gaya he ki balaatkaar ke aarope kaa paryaapt aadhaar hone par aropit ko jamaanat nahin milegi
 The Bill states that the punishment period in such cases shall not be less than seven years and may also carry life imprisonment
 prastaavit vidheyak main kaha gaya he ki balaatkaar ke aarope main giraftaar yaa phir aatmasamarpan karne vaale vyakti ko sirf aadhaaron par jamaanat di ja sakegi
 Under the first premise, the court, including the High Court and the Sessions Court, will have to satisfy that the accused is not guilty of any crime
 doosraa, aaropee 16 saal se kam umr kaa ho, biimaar ho yaa phir aksham ho

 sex sambandh banaate vakt mahilaayein kisi purush se kya chaahati hai, yah hameshaa se hi shodh kaa vishay rahaa he
 Much has been written on this earlier
 isi mudde par tazatreen research ke nattejey saamne aae hai
 More than 700 women have expressed their views openly in addition to the topics of sex related topics
 mahilaayein bistar par kya chaahati hai mard se, jaaniye wo 12 raaj
 
 
 1
 sirf kamkrida par hi ho puraa dhyanbistar par mahila partner kii yon-ichha ko trupt karne ke liye sabase jaruri cheez he- ‘jajba’
 About 42 per cent of the women surveyed accepted this
 mahilaayein kai tareeke se purushon ke pyaar ko mahasoos karti hai, jinamein sabase zyada inkaa dhyaan khinchataa he aapke munh se kii gayi ‘sharaaraten’
 To show love in the eyes, to move the lips on sensitive organs, to touch the body in any other way is pleasing to women
 jeebh ke agle bhaag se najuk angon kaa sparsh bhi mahilaon kaa man machalane ke liye kaaphi hota he
 2
 forple kii ahmiyat sabase zyadakamakrida kaa asli majaa sirf charam tak pahunchane par hi nahin he, balki iske har pal kaa bharpoor anand lenaa chahie
 The foreplay is also an important part of it, which has its own fun
 survey main shaamil mahilaon ne mana ki forple ke dauraan hone vaali uttejnaa ekadam alag tarah kii hoti he
 Women said that men should be a bit 'creative' in terms of sex
 kuch nayaa or ekadam alag andaaj main kiya janaa mahilaon ko khub bhaataa he
 3
 ‘anand’ va ‘santushti’ main fark hekkinsle institute ke shodh main yah paaya gaya ki purushon ke saath-saath mahilaon ne bhi yah mana ki unhen condom ke bina yon sambandh zyada acha lagata he
 But women also believed that they are more relaxed when condoms are used during sexual intercourse
 yah sukun 'protection' ko lekar hota he
 The women surveyed said that condoms are an effective way of preventing sexual diseases
 iske istemaal se mahilaayein khulkar sex kaa bharpoor majaa le paati hai
 4
 dhire-dhire, aaraam se
 
 
 All women want that their very soft organs should not be given much trouble in the initial stages
 mahilaayein purushon se chaahati hai ki ve uske sensitive angon ke saath samvedansheeltaa se hi pesh aaen
 This means that during sexual intercourse, if they want to use the tongue and fingers to create the necessary sensations, then they should eradicate it by giving them trouble
 5
 Environment also affects 50% of the women admitted that they could not reach the peak due to lack of favorable weather and environment during sexual intercourse
 mahilaon ne mana ki darasal purushon ke thande paanv kii vajah se unhen zyada takalif hoti he
 Dr
 holstage ne kaha ki sex ke dauraan vaataavaran bhi kaaphi myne rakhata he
 If the room temperature is favorable, it enhances the sex
 6
 Keep the position during sex, it is very important to take care of the position while making a relationship relationship
 stri ke nichle bhaag ko agar do-teen takiyon ke sahare thodaa-sa or upar uthaakar sambhog kiya jaae, to isse sansarg thik se ho paata he
 The situation is also better when the woman comes on top of the lying man and has sexual intercourse
 isse striyaan ‘un’ angon main zyada uttejnaa mahasoos karti hai
 Another position women and men like is 'doggy Style'
 matlab, jisamen stri ghutanon or haathon ke bal khud ko santulit kiye rahati he or purush uske thik peeche jaakar sambhog karata he
 7
 tareeke to or bhi hai
 
 
 Australian sex researcher Juliet Richters says that only one in five women surveyed believed they reached orgasm only through normal sexual intercourse
 zyaadaatar yuva mahilaon kaa maananaa tha ki ve apane partner se chaahati he ki ve sex ke dauraan apane haath or munh kaa bhi zyada istemaal karen
 He came to know this fact during a survey conducted on 19 thousand people for his book
 90 fisadi se zyada mahilaon ne mana ki ve keval sex ke dauraan apane partner dwaara mukh kaa bhi istemaal kiye jane ke baad charam tak pahunchati hai
 Research has found that when the play is done in a relaxed, gradual, but continuous manner, the pair quickly reach the peak
 8
 In a hurry, only fifty percent of the women involved in the 'work' censure said that they reached the peak in 10 minutes or less
 sex medicine ke ek jarnal main prakashit study ke mutabik, sex main jaldbaaji dikhalaane par purush to santusht ho jate hai, par mahilaayein charam tak nahin pahunch paati hai
 In such a situation, it is the responsibility of men to take their partner with them in a long game without hurrying
 9
 Identifying Sensitive Other Organs Researchers on sex have found that not only is the G-spot sufficient to give pleasure, but there are other parts in the body of women where sensations are more
 isamen A- spot bhi shaamil he, jahaan sahalaane se mahilaon kaa sharir yon kriya ke liye shaareerik rup se taiyaar ho paata he
 Fingering of fingers is useful in this work
 10
 Test the preparation properly: There is also a lot of mistake in testing whether a woman is ready for sexual intercourse or not
 california uniwarsity main lekturer barbara kisaling kaa maananaa he ki sirf bahari lakshan se hi isaki pahchaan sambhav nahin he
 According to him, 'butterfly position' is better than most
 11
 One has to pay the 'price'
 
 
 agar mahila apane thakaaoo kaam yaa neend kii kami kii vajah se pareshaan he, to isak sthiti main vah mushkil se uttejit hoti he
 In such a situation, the responsibility of men increases
 purushon ko chahie ki ve vyanjan pakaane yaa kapade dhone aadi kaam main inaki madad karen
 The women surveyed admitted that in a situation when men help their work, they feel better
 12
 It is not necessary to reach the peak every time, the woman must reach the peak every time, it is not necessary
 kai baar tanaav va thakaan kii vajah se aisa nahin ho paata
 In such a situation, instead of forcibly continuing the 'game' for half an hour, it is better to end it
 charam tak na le jane ke liye har baar purush hi jimmedaar nahin hota
 Still, if the woman wants, you can satisfy her with your hands and fingers
 kul milakar is krida kaa anand hi myne rakhata he
 Vandalism of 'dial 100' in Sambhal district of Uttar Pradesh caused a furore when a woman died
 shanivaar ko khet main pani ko lekar shuru hue vivaad ke baad soochna par pahunchi dial 100 kii police jhagada kar rahe donon yuvakon ko pakadakar thane le jane lagi, tabhi apane ek bete ko police se chhudaane pahuchi maa ko police ne dhakka de diya

 He was being taken to the hospital, but died on the way

 shivpal ne yah bhi kaha ki samaajawaadee party ke vidhayak or saansad kovind ke samarthan main vot daalenge
 When asked if Kovind had asked for votes from him, he said, "meera Kumar did not ask for support from me, Kovind asked for it and Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath also spoke to cast his vote in favor of Kovind
 '' See- unhone kaha ki ramnath kovind zyada dharmanirpeksh hai or samaajawaadee hai, saath hi ve unke padosi bhi hai

 From 8 am to 12 am
 inkaa taalluk us maihar band se he, jisaki buniyaad hindustani shastreey sangeet kii mahamedhavi shakhsiyat or anveshak baba allaudin khan ne rakhi thi
 Baba, who is a five-time Namaji and goes up to the hill of more than four km every morning to see Sarada Devi of Maihar
 pan
 Baba who gave rapturous sitarists like Ravi Shankar and Nikhil Banerjee
 duniya main sarod kii alakh jagaane vaale ali akbar khan to unke apane bete the
 The legends of his strict discipline in music are still recited to the present day
 aise baba kaa shastreey saajon vaala yah akelaa-anoothaa band he
 Baba had told about this band in his story by writing, "A band party was also prepared as per the orders of Raja (the then Raja Brijnath Singh of Maihar who sat on the throne in 1917)
 saare anaath bacchon ko usamen shaamil kiya
 Gathered a hundred and fifty boys by beating Dundee
 ve mere hi ghar par rahete, khate-pite
 
 
 Taught the king for eight hours
 chaar ghante band kaa kaam
 
 
 The king would say - If i go out anywhere, i should listen to the song
 koi kahin bhi besura na rahe
 "A band with such a historical background, established in 1918, was not doing well for a long time
" saajon or kalakaaron kii koi khoj-khabar lene vaala nahin
 There is no way to review his performance
 vaise to 1949 main hi aazaadee ke baad vindhyas pradesh banane par band ko khatm karne kii naubat aa gai thi
 But then the Central Government intervened and saved it
 1955 main yahaan sangeet kaa ek college kholkar band ko usase jod diya gaya
 Well, concerned with the plight of this heritage, some Sudhejans recently referred it to Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan and requested to do something for the band
 usee kaa nateeja tha ki 1 november ko pradesh ke sthapana diwas samaaroh ke maukey par bhopal main is band kii prastuti ke baad chouhan ne ise pradesh kii saanskrithik dharohar kaa darja dene kaa elaan kiya
 One of the long-time band's two tablaists, Dr
 ashok badholia kehete hai, ''ham kalakaaron ke liye vah sachmuch bhavuk kar dene vaala pal tha
 We travel in a sleeper carrying 50-50 kg of equipment
 bada ksht hota he
 "looking at some parts of the music college, it seems that it has not been cleaned even for decades
 asal main rajdhani bhopal se maihar (jila satna) kii duuri 450 kimi se bhi zyada he
 The cultural superficiality of the successive governments in the state had increased this distance manifold
 us elaan ke natijatan band ke kalakaaron main ek nayaa josh, nai sphurti aa gai he
 His performance of Raag Yemen at the Tansen function in Gwalior last week was so well received by the audience that on his insistence, he had to play another bandh of Rag Bageshri Kanhara
 ab saare kalakaar agle hafte (24-26 disambar) baba kii hi yaad main hone vaale salanaa sangeet samaaroh ke liye riyaj main jute gaye hai
 Says Suresh Chaturvedi, the band chief and also in charge of the music college for the last seven years, says to Ghadd Bhav, "it has now been approved to fill four vacant posts of signatories in the college
 ” ab janvari main akashwani ke liye dilli main recording kaa bulaava he or farvari main kolkata janaa he
 Now the people of the band are planning to do some performance every month in Maihar too
 sarkaar kai pahaluon se soch rahi he
 State Culture Minister Laxmikant Sharma says, "all the worries about the rare instruments of the band, and the instrumentation, the lack of artists and the building, etc
 will be allayed
" ” saaj sachmuch badi chintaaon main se ek he
 Baba included Indian instruments like sitar, tabla, harmonium, and western instruments like chelo and violin
 unhone sitar par prayog ke saath ek nayaa saaj sitar banjo or iske alaava sarod, saarangi or sitar teenon kii khaasiyaton vaala chandra saarang bhi ijad kiya
 But the lead instrument of the band is still the umbilical wave, which was made by Baba by cutting the guns of old guns
 chandra saarang bajaane vaala to ab yahaan koi bhi nahin he
 Prabhudayal Dwivedi of the band is the only writer of Nalatarang
 band ke zyaadaatar kalakaar sthaneey hai
 They realize that they are running a big legacy, but what should be done for them, it is not in their concerns
 band ke liye baba 3 minute se 3 ghante tak bajaane laayak kareeb 150 bandishen bana gaye the
 The current band plays 30–35 bandish among them
 (unheen main se koi chugali bhi karata he ki 15-20 se zyada nahin)
 But these people do not have a single notation written
 sab kuch kalakaaron ke dimag main he
 These people never spoke about their publicity
 nateeja? itani samrudh viraasat ke baavjood unhen kabhi videsh jane kaa mauka nahin mila
 Its artists are quite malicious
 vibhinn deshon se saanskrithik samanvay ke tahat kalakaaron ko videsh bhejne or bulaane vaali bhartiya saanskrithik sambandh parishad (isisiar) ko jaise is band ke astitv kii khabar hi nahin
 Many attempts to learn about this from its director general Suresh Goyal failed
 khayr, band ne kisi bhi tarah se kuch nayaa karne kii kyon nahin sochi? is par 1979 se band main sakriy chaturvedi bas gum-phirakar itnaa hi kehete hai ki ''hamaare paas baba kii dharohar he, usee ko sanjokar chalate hai
 "the recently departed Pt
 ravishankar ke shishy or maihar hokar aae shubhendra raav yahaan ek ahm baat jodate hai, ''dekhie, baba behad doordarshee or udaar shakhsiyat the
 When he had included instruments like chelo and violin at that time, today he would have done something new by thinking even further
 ”yahi sawaal ab baba ke pautra 62 varshiya rajesh khan uthaa rahe hai
 With the intention of inheriting the heritage, he settled here last February from his family from Dubai and is taking home near Baba's protected original residence and teaching music to 25-30 students and there are plans to open a Gurukula here
 band or sangeet vidhyalay kii 'badahaali’ par ve kupit hai or inkaa prashasan unke haath main dene ke liye mukhyamantri chouhan se aagrah bhi chuke hai
 But Culture Minister Sharma is not aware of this
 chaturvedi kehete hai, ''hamen rajesh ji ke saath milakar kaam karne main koi aapatti nahin
 "but Rajesh, who brought the artisans of the band, who brought in an artisan from Kolkata, says," Old things are disappearing
 abhi ke log paryaapt yogya nahin hai
 i should be given administrative rights, so that i can do something to save the legacy
 ” is baar ke maihar utsav main unke bade bhai ashish khan or bhattije shiraj khan bhi aa rahe hai
 Apart from him, Rajesh will also play Sarod
 jo bhi ho, band kaa or uske liye apni umr qurbaan karne waalon kaa swar kaayam rahanaa chahie

 They never look angry and a glimpse of a slight smile on their face is a rare occurrence
 lekin jab desh chahta he ki ve drudh hon, kade nirnay len, or desh kii kamyaabi ke saath khush hon tab yah masini cheharaa deshavaasiyon kaa bharosa nahin badhaata
 When India is facing border encroachment and inhuman insensitivity on the part of its hostile neighbors, they remain fully situated
 unke chaaron ore jab ghotaalon kaa bavandar machaa he or unke apane log chhitak kar dur ja rahe hai, ve in sabase upar kuch nahin dekhne, kuch nahin sunne or kuch mahasoos nahin karne kii avasthaa ko praapt kar chuke dikhte hai
 They are beyond doubt and have nothing to do with accountability
 ve bharat ke pradhanmantri hai, jo kaaphi teji se desh ke liye nahin to kam-se-kam sarkaar ke liye sabase badi sharmindagi main tabdeel hote ja rahe hai

 Just a day earlier, on 30 April, the Congress was held back breathlessly awaiting the decision of the Supreme Court on the government's revised CBI coal scam affidavit

 He postponed the major part of his hearing till 6 May
 isse congress ko kuch vakt mil gaya
 Meanwhile, the opposition in Parliament, one kilometer away from the Congress headquarters, stalled all the proceedings, sparing the Finance Bill

 C
 chaako kii harakat bhi pradhanmantri ke gale kii haddi ban chuki he
 For the first time in nine years, Manmohan Singh has become a burden for the ruling coalition
 unki taaja dikkatein beete 5 march ko shuru hui thim, jab kendriya kanoon mantri ashvini kumaar ne atorni general gulam vaahnavati ko phone milakar koyala ghotaale par sibiai kii us jaanch report kii sthiti janani chaahi thi, jise supreme court main jamaa kiya janaa tha
 Ashwini Kumar wanted to gauge how much the scandal would be blamed on the Prime Minister, who was also the coal minister himself during the allocation of disputed coal blocks in 2008 and 2009
 vaahnavati ne unhen ek baithak bulaane kii salaah di or kaha ki isamen sibiai ke vakil atirikt solicytor general harin pi
 Rawal should be summoned
 iske baad rawal us baithak main apane str par sibiai ke jaanch adhikari ko talab karenge
 Vahanvati also advised Ashwani Kumar that one joint secretary each from the Ministry of Coal and the PMO be called in that meeting
 baithak kii taarikh agle din 6 march rakhi gai
 CBI director Ranjit Sinha was also called
 yah atigopneey baithak thi
 After this, on March 12, Rawal clearly told the Supreme Court that there was no political interference in the CBI report
 unhone jhooth bolaa tha
 But this wonderful plan of the government came to light when senior judge R, a member of the bench of three judges hearing the coal scam
 em
 Lodha emphasized that the CBI should file an affidavit, not a status report
 court ko spasht taur par yah jaananaa tha ki kya sarkaar ne sibiai kii report se chhedchhad kii he? jaanch kii saamagree saajha karke ab tak kanoon mantri or duusare adhikariyon kii madad karte rahe sibiai nideshak sinha is mode par mukar gaye
 He insisted that he could not lie in the affidavit
 unhone kaha ki unhen supreme court ko yah bataanaa hi padegaa ki kanoon mantri or duusare afasaron ke saath unhone jaanch report saajha kii thi
 If sources are to be believed, the CBI director did not want to risk breach of oath by writing lies in the affidavit
 iske baad 15 april ko ek pramukh dainik ne khabar chhap di ki sibiai supreme court se yah kehane ja rahi he ki uski report se sarkari afasaron ne chhedchhad kii he
 All the officials who attended the meeting on 6 March were named in this news but Vahanvati's name was missing
 sarkaar kaa gorakhdhandha puri tarah benakaab ho chukaa tha
 The Supreme Court on 30 April accused the government of "breaching the pledge"
 us din bhi vaahnavati lagaataar kehete rahe ki unhone report nahin dekhi he
 This meant that the two most senior law officers in the government lied before the Supreme Court as they wanted to save Manmohan Singh from the heat of the coal scam
 vaahnavati ne 28 april ko pradhanmantri se 7 rescorse road par mulaakaat kar kaaphi lambii baatcheet kii thi ki 30 april ko supreme court main sarkaar kii ranneeti kya rahegi
 Ultimately it was decided that the government would not adopt a defensive posture
 yah pehla bada ghotaalaa nahin he jiske saakshyon kaa sira pradhanmantri tak pahunchaa he
 Nor is this the first attempt of Congress to suppress anything
 tatkaaleen doorsanchaar mantri e
 The Prime Minister's role in instigating Raja for the 2G scam is still pending investigation, despite P

 Chacko tried his best to call off the inquiry without calling the Prime Minister for question and answer
 is ghotaale par daalaa gaya paradaa koyala ghotaale ke mukaable kuch hi aasaan rahaa kyonki 2ji maamle main sarkaar (or chaako) ne lagaataar puri koshish kii ki sara dosha e
 Put the king over
 koyala ghotaale main bich main kahin koi mantri nahin he, jise bali kaa bakra banaaya ja sake
 The Prime Minister himself had signed files to give free coal blocks to companies with questionable credibility
 vastav main 27 agast, 2012 ko sansad main die apane bayaan main unhone koyala mantralay main liye gaye saare faislon kii jimmedaari khud ke upar lee thi
 He had said, "being in charge of the ministry, i take full responsibility for all the decisions of the ministry
 ’’ iske alaava ve manmohan hi the jinhone janvari 2005 main koyala mantralay kii sujhai gai nilaamiyon ko tatkaaleen kanoon mantri hansraj bharadwaj kii madad se roak diya tha
 The ministry had, in its first opinion, talked of auctioning it by an administrative order but Manmohan sought her second opinion on it
 pradhanmantri ko ab kuch to bolnaa hi padegaa
 If indeed Harin Rawal, Ashwini Kumar, Ghulam Vahanvati, CBI, PMO and Coal Ministry officials have done all this scandal without their consent and knowledge and have clearly violated the order of the Supreme Court, then the Prime Minister needs to resign It should be taken while the Prime Minister is standing firmly behind his infamous Law Minister
 yadi aisa nahin he to iskaa arth sidhe khud unki kursi kaa janaa hoga
 Manmohan had made a strong statement on April 27 at the Rashtrapati Bhavan during the defense induction ceremony, "there is no question of the resignation of the law minister
" ’’ iskaa sidhaa matlab yah nikalataa he ki main nahin jane vaala
 When his own role was questioned, he came into his old defensive avatar, "the matter is in court
" ’’piemo ke adhikari jor dekar kehete hai ki manmohan singh ke paas chupaane ko kuch bhi nahin he
 "the CBI is investigating companies, not the government," says a PMO source
 pradhanmantri ne to koyala ghotaale par pehle hi sansad main paardarshee bayaan de diya he
 The government actually became the victim of a corporate feud, just like it was in 2G
 ’’party aadhikarik taur par khud ko kaaphi kadaa dikhaa rahi he
 Congress general secretary Janardan Dwivedi says, "as far as the Supreme Court's comments are concerned, i believe that its final opinion is yet to come and as soon as it happens, a suitable decision can be taken
" ’’ upie ke varisht mantri haalanki andarkhaane maayoos hai
 They believe that some action will have to be taken to face the charges of opposition
 ve pradhanmantri se isaki ummid kar rahe hai
 a senior Union Minister believes that the Law Minister should resign but it may not happen
 ek or mantri sidhe shabdon main kehete hai, ‘‘ashvini kumaar ko bachaane par jor dekar pradhanmantri party ke liye sharmindagi paidaa kar rahe hai
 "many within the Congress believe that only the Prime Minister can get Ashwani Kumar's resignation because he is considered a man of the Prime Minister
 iske alaava, is par bhi shaq he ki ashvini kumaar ne yah sab pradhanmantri ke prati vafadari ke chalate unhen bachaane ke liye kiya yaa phir iske peeche kisi or kaa haath tha
 The biggest challenge for the Congress at the moment is that after May 6, it will get some more time
 isaki sambhaavna ho sakati he kyonki 10 may se agle 45 dinon ke liye supreme court greeshmavkash ke liye band rahegaa
 On this day, the current session of Parliament will also end and then the monsoon session will start in late July
 congress kii ek or ummid yah he ki 8 may ko use karnataka ke chunaav main jeet hasil hogi or is tarah bhrashtachar kii sangeen ko vah bijepi kii ore mode degi
 Rahul Gandhi has already made this an issue in his election rallies
 lekin bijepi peeche hatane nahin ja rahi he
 He is targeted by the Prime Minister
 rajyasabha main bijepi ke upanetaa ravishankar prasad kehete hai, ‘‘sarkaar ne rawal ke saath milakar supreme court ke samaksh tathyon ko tod-marod kar pesh kiya he
 We are more concerned about knowing what becomes the Prime Minister's accountability as he himself is the subject of investigation this time
 ’’sarkaar ko hilaa dene vaale ghotaale rahe hon chaahe or jaruri mudde, pradhanmantri ne apni vishwasaneeyata ko durust karne ke liye kuch khaas nahin kiya he
 His rude statements are probably his smallest problem
 ladakh main chini ghuspaith kii khabaren saarvajanik hue do hafte ho gaye, lekin ab tak pradhanmantri kaa iklauta bayaan is masale par 27 april ko aayaa tha jisamen unhone kaha, ‘‘hamaare paas bhi ek yojana he
 We do not want to drag the situation further
 ’’ lagaataar ho rahe atikaraman ke barakes unka yah bayaan kamajori kii gavaahi detaa he
 Manmohan's favorite strategy has been to keep distance from all important matters of policy and governance
 yah ab kargar sabit nahin ho rahi
 According to the opposition, despite being the Prime Minister, he does not have much rights
 yashavanth sinha kehete hai, ‘‘satta ke do kendron vaali pranali adarsh maani gai thi: sonia party main or manmohan sarkaar main
 But they take all their strength from Sonia only
 jab se rahul congress ke upaadhyaksh bane hai, manmohan number teen par aa gaye hai
 Leave the alliance, they cannot lead the party either
 ’’pradhanmantri kii badtar sthiti par yah ek sahanubhutipurna bayaan mana ja saktaa he
 However, he could have been strict with his coalition partners
 masalan, 2009 main jab puraa upie unki chhatrachhaaya main majboot khadaa tha, ve diemke ko e
 Instead of Raja, another telecom minister could have asked for suggestions
 tab tak janvari 2008 main kii gayi e
 The King's services had also become public
 ve us vakt rajnatik taur par majboot the, phir bhi unhone gathbandhan ke dabaav ke aage ghutane tekna manjuur kar liya
 Barring the nuclear deal, it is his inability to stand firmly on decisive matters that has made Manmohan Singh a blot in the Prime Minister's name
 ab bhi yah kayaas hi lagaaya ja saktaa he ki loksabhaa chunaav niyat samay yani april 2014 main honge yaa shaayad november 2013 main
 The Congress is looking at its options
 yadi usne loksabhaa chunaav ko rajya ke chunaavon ke saath karwaane kaa man banaaya to uske paas logon se kehane ko kuch nahin hoga
 If the elections were held on time, he would probably get the benefit of the cash subsidy and food security bill
 congress ke prabandhakon kaa maananaa he ki agar supreme court ne uski haalat patali nahin kar di to chunaav apane samay par hi hoga
 The Congress will at least have the benefit that the BJP is still stuck in its vicious cycle and the leadership question has not been resolved there
 vam dal bhi chaahate hai ki mamata banerjee ko or vakt satta main mili taaki unki vishwasaneeyata ko or nuksaan pahunche
 Samajwadi Party's Mulayam Singh Yadav and Bahujan Samaj Party supremo Mayawati are currently focusing their attention on Uttar Pradesh
 diemke apane khandaan ko ghotaalon se bachaane main masaroof he jabaki eiediemke kii dilchaspee srilanka ke tamilon main zyada he
 Overall, the national agenda is missing from this country at the moment
 aam chunaavon kaa vakt jo bhi rahe, matadaataaon ke dimag main bhrashtachar or aarthik kuprabandhan (buniyadi taur par mahangaai) kaa mudda hi chaaya rahane vaala he
 Now it is a misfortune of Manmohan Singh that the public sees them as a symbol of both
 kabhi in donon masalon par unki jitani bedaag or behtareen chhavi thi, vah utani hi zyada patan kaa shikaar hui he
 They are easy targets for the opposition's attack, be it BJP or smaller parties, who are dreaming of coming together in a 'federal front'
 jis vakt bharat ko ek aise netaa kii jarurat he, jo bharosa kho chuke siyaasi tabake se mohabhang kii shikaar janata ko tasalli dekar protsaahit kar sake, ve desh ke saamne chup ho gaye hai
 There is another speculation in the air that instead of Manmohan Singh, there may be a prime minister who is immaculate
 congress haalanki ise lekar uhapoh main he
 Even if he thought of getting rid of the Prime Minister, it would simply mean that he had confessed his crime
 agar usne manmohan singh ko pad par banaae rakhaa to yah bojh uski bachi-khuchi vishwasaneeyata ko bhi chaat jayega or jaahir he, voton kaa nuksaan to hoga hi
 The party is hesitant to remove him and place another man loyal to the family on the Prime Minister's chair, but this work is possible after the 2014 elections on its own
 dikkat yah he ki 2014 kii kursi rahul gandhi ke liye honi chahie thi, lekin ve ab tak yah tay hi nahin kar sake hai ki unhen pradhanmantri karyaalay main baith kar desh ko chalaanaa he yaa apni maa kii tarah ghar main aaraam se baithkar
 For this reason, Manmohan Singh has now become a necessary burden for the Congress - perhaps the country does not consider him so important

 yoga guru ramdev ne aataa noodles launch karne se pehle food sefti and standard athurity kii manjuuri nahi lee he
 He argues that he has got a license for pasta and noodles belongs in this category
 lekin athurity kaa kahana he ki instant noodles ke liye alag se ijaajat kii jarurat he
 FSSAI chairman Ashish Bahuguna has told NDTV that neither Patanjali Yoga nor Aayush, Baba Ramdev's company, has a license to make noodle
 unhone bataaya ki bharat main keval 10 companiyon ko instant noodle banane kaa license diya gaya he
 After all, you have to know whether these noodles are safe or not
 is bich enditivi india kii jaanch se niklaa ki yahaan ek hi license number se alag-alag khaadya padaarth beche ja rahe hai
 Oats are also available at Patanjali Hospital in Pandav Nagar, Delhi, and flour and noodles are also available
 lekin in teenon alag-alag utpaadon kaa license number ek hi he - 10014012000266
 When we talked to shopkeeper Nishant Goyal about this, he said that earlier this thing was not in my knowledge, now he will talk to Patanjali about this
 vaise 16 nanvabar ko hi yoga guru ramdev ne apana ye aataa noodles dilli main badi dhoomdhaam se launch kiya tha
 But due to the objection of the Food Safety and Standards Authority, he is now clarifying that something has gone wrong
 unke mutabik patanjali ke saare utpaadon kii ethesaai se apruval lee gai he
 It is worth mentioning that on the last Monday itself, Yoga Guru Baba Ramdev's Patanjali Ayurved has introduced 'nutritious' instant noodle, which will compete with Nestle's Maggi brand
 nestle kaa yah utpaada bhi bhartiya bazaar main paanch maheene ke pratibandh ke baad pichley saptaah phir pesh kiya gaya
 To meet the demand for its products, Patanjali is set to set up five new manufacturing units within a year, which will be set up in delhi-ncr, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh
 tippaniyan Ramdev had said during this time, 'by the end of December our noodle will arrive in 10 lakh shops
 ham apni utpaadan kshamta badha rahe hai
 However, he did not give details of the investment to be made in setting up new plants
 patanjali ne 70 gram ke aataa noodle kii keemat 15 rupee rakhi he or daawa kiya gaya he ki yah pratispardhiyon ke mukaable sasta he
 So Ramdev's noodles are engulfed in controversy as soon as he comes to the market, while Maggie is returning to the shops
 ethesaai ke chairmen ashish bahuguna ne enditivi ko bataaya he ki na to patanjali yoga or na hi aayush, baba ramdev kii kisi bhi company ke paas noodle banane kaa license nahin he
 He informed that only 10 companies in India have been given license to make instant noodle
 aakhir ye jaananaa hoga ki ye noodles surakshit hai yaa nahin
 Meanwhile, NDTV India investigation revealed that different foods are being sold here with the same license number
 dilli ke pandav nagar main patanjali chikitsaalay main oats bhi mil rahaa he, aataa bhi or aataa noodles bhi
 But the license number of these three different products is the same - 10014012000266
 jab is bare main hamane dukandaar nishanth goyal se baat kii to unhone kaha ki pehle ye baat meri jaankaree main nahin thi, ab is bare main wo patanjali se baat karenge
 However, on November 16, Yoga Guru Ramdev launched his dough noodles with great fanfare in Delhi
 lekin food sefti and standard athurity ke aitraaj ke ab wo safai de rahe hai ki kahin kuch gafalat hui he
 According to him, all the products of Patanjali have been approved from FSSAI
 ullekhneey he ki beete somvaar ko hi yoga guru baba ramdev ke patanjali ayurveda ne 'paushtik' instant noodle pesh kiya he, jo nestle ke megi brands se muqabla karegaa
 This Nestle product was also reintroduced in the Indian market last week after a five-month ban
 apane utpaadon kii maang puri karne ke liye patanjali saal bhar ke andar paanch nai menuphaccharing uniton kii sthapana karne kii taiyaari main he, jo dilli-ensiaar, madhya pradesh, maharashtra, karnataka or uttar pradesh main sthapit kii jaaengi
 The comments ramdev ne is dauraan kaha tha, 'disambar ke ant tak hamaara noodle 10 lakh dukaanon main aayega
 We are increasing our production capacity
 ' haalanki unhone nae sanyantron kii sthapana main hone vaale nivesh kaa byoraa nahin diya tha
 Patanjali has priced the 70 gram flour noodle for Rs 15 and it has been claimed that it is cheaper than the competitors

 Released this Friday is 'raja Natwarlal', directed by Kunal Deshmukh, and Emraan Hashmi, Pakistani actress Humaima Malik, Paresh Rawal, KK Menon, Deepak Tijori and Sumit Nizhavan in lead roles
 
 
 'raja natvarlaal' main imran hashmi ek thag bane hai, jiskaa naam he raja or vah apane dost raghav, yani deepak tijori ke saath milakar choti-moti thagi karata he
 
 
 Jiya is in the king's life, making him love, and she is a bar dancer
 
 
 lekin raja ko lagata he ki choti-moti thagi se zindagi nahin sudharne vaali, isliye vah raghav ke saath milakar 80 lakh rupee kii chori karata he
 
 
 This theft is overshadowed by them, because that money belongs to the underworld King Wardha Yadav, who runs his business from Cape Town
 
 
 bas, isse aage kii kahani aapako nahin bataa saktaa, or agar aapako puri kahani janani he, to tikat kharidkar film dekhni padegi
 
 
 But i will tell you, the merits and demerits of the film
 
 
 sabase pehle baat khaamiyon kii
 
 
 The songs of the film will not attract you much, and anyway they have slowed down the pace of the film
 
 
 haalanki diarector kunal deshmukh ne koshish kii he ki gaanon ke bich main bhi film kii kahani aage badhati rahe, lekin vah is koshish main puri tarah kaamyaab nahin ho paae
 
 
 In the script, all the fakes of the film have been woven by the filmmaker according to his convenience
 
 
 film main kuch dialog achche hai, lekin adaayagi ke vakt asardaar nahin lagate
 
 
 Kunal and Imran's team have once again made cricket a weapon, and perhaps that's why i missed the movie 'jannat' while watching the film, which according to me is not good for 'raja Natwarlal'
 
 
 ab baat karte hai khoobiyon kii
 
 
 All the actors have done justice to their respective characters
 
 
 yun to humaima malik pakistani film 'bol' main sabakaa dil jeet chuki hai, lekin yahaan bhi unhone acha kaam kiya he
 
 
 Deepak Vault seems to be acting smoothly
 
 
 sumit nizaavan bhrasht inspector ke role main feet hai
 
 
 Emraan Hashmi has done his work honestly
 
 
 kai jagah film main aage kya hone vaala he, aap pehle se anumaan laga sakate hai, lekin film se shaayad aap ruchi nahin khoyenge
 
 
 The film's team has done well by adding a sense of friendship to the thugs, and perhaps people can join it
 
 
 meri taraf se film kii reating he - 2

 From time to time films have been made on the ravaged rebels
 1994 main kaan film festival kaa hissaa bani or 1996 main bharat main release hui shekhar kapur kii bandit queen apane nirmam, krur or hard hiting chithran se bhartiya cinema main mile kaa pathar sabit hui thi
 The bandits, who used to speak profanity in typical language, had achieved a new level of realism in films
 iske baad saal 2010 main ai irfan khan kii film paan singh tomars bhi chambal kii ek behtareen film kahi ja sakati he
 But Sonchiriya is not able to touch that level
 abhishek choube kii film main dakaiton ke luks or cinemetography par to dhyaan diya gaya he, lekin kirdaaron kii aatma ke saath film nyaay nahin kar pai he
 Son bird could have been made better
 kahaneimergency kaa daur he or sarkaar ne chambal ke baagiyon par nakel kasne kaa man bana liya he
 Man Singh (manoj Bajpayee) arrives at a wedding for robbery with his gang
 gang ke kuch usul bhi hai
 Like do not harm children and women
 haalanki lut ke dauraan police kii dharpakad hoti he or maan singh police ke haathon maaraa jaataa he
 After this, senior gang member Vakil Singh (ranveer Shorey) takes charge of the gang
 is bich ek thakur mahila ek bacchee ko lekar behad main pahunchati he
 What has happened to the child that Lakhan (sushant Singh Rajput) begins to connect emotionally with her and makes it her motive to take him to the hospital
 iske liye aapako film dekhne janaa hoga
 Actingalkhan's character is going through a lot of chaos
 baagi lakhan astitvvaadi sawaalon se jujh rahaa he
 'what is the religion of the rebel?' And many dialogues like 'I used to be a rebel, now feel rebellious, now i feel ashamed' that he does not just follow sheepishly
 balki dilodimag se sochataa bhi he
 At the same time, Manoj Bajpayee appears only in parts of the film
 desh ke sarvshereshth actors main shumaar manoj jab-jab screen par najar aate hai, sammohit karte hai
 His dialogue uttered with a wry smile, 'has anyone ever died from the official bullet
 inke to vaadon se mare hai sab
 Sisters, brothers
 ” aaj ke daur main bhi praasangik he
 Ranveer Shorey's makeup in the character of Vakil Singh also looks very special and he has already carried many films on his shoulders, in which "titli" can be called very important
 lekin is film main ranvir kii original awaz kaa naa hona akharata he
 The director of the film, Abhishek Chaubey, should make it clear why the voice of an actor like him was not used in the film
 police officer kii bhoomika main ashutosh rana apni krurta se impress karte hai
 He had said that director Abhishek Chaubey acts like a Democratic dictator in his films
 baavjood ashutosh kii krur dikhne kii naiysargik kshamta unhen film kaa sabase real kairactor banaati he
 At the same time, as a Thakur's wife, by performing the land, she performs her responsibility well
 nirdeshnaudta punjab ke baad se hi abhishek choube se logon kii ummiden kaaphi bad gayi thi
 He went to the rugged locations of Chambal and shot at real locations
 yahi kaaran he ki film kii cinemetography kaaphi acchhee he
 Chaube has tried to show this in a philosophical film with bandits, how pathetic and unsafe these robber-looking robbers in the rugged forests can be from inside
 haalanki film main daakuon ke samvaad kai maukon par vaastavik nahin lagate
 On some occasions, the film's twists are also difficult to digest
 masalan, ek khoonkhwaar daaku apane bhai ke hatyare ko bina kuch kiye chhod detaa he or 'police kii dharpakad kii khabar hone ke baavjood daaku kaa gang gaanvvaalon ko luutane kii koshish karata he', aise kuch sawaal hai jo script kii kamazori kaa ishaara karte hai
 Apart from this, killing many characters in the film's climax could also have been avoided as it seems unwarranted
 film main jati pratha, pitrusatta, ling bhed or andhvishwaas bhi ahm hissaa he
 Why see this film can be seen for the acting of Ashutosh Rana, Manoj Bajpayee and Ranveer Shorey
 film main bandit queen yani phulan devi kaa twist bhi kaaphi dilachasp he
 It is reminiscent of Hitler's fictional character in the film Inglorious Bastardz of "quentin Tarantino"
 kyon naa dekhenbhi apni-apni son chidiya ko dhund rahe he
 Everyone is looking for freedom in the rugged and the reasons for not watching this film, the reasons for not watching the film are overshadowed

 The film will be released in theaters on December 23
 dubai main shahrukh ke saath unki sah star priyanka chopra, nirdeshak farhaan akhtar or nirmaataa ritesh siddhvani the, lekin sabhi kii najar shahrukh par hi thi
 In response to a question from an audience, he said, 'I do not consider myself ideal
 mere bhi apane chote bachche hai or main unke liye filmein banaata hum, lekin meraa maananaa he ki unhen sabhi prakaar kii kahaniyon se rubaru hone dena chahie, taaki ve apane tantra ke bare main samajhen-bujhen or unke saath bahut hi saralata se bade hon
 We are not justifying anything here
 ' If you are employed, then you will have to do more for investment in tax savings this year
 aapane sevings kaa certificate daftar main jamaa kar diya he to aapako acchhee tarah pataa hoga ki kaise pehali baar tex free investment kii limit puraa karnaa pehle se mushkil ho gaya he
 In July last year, in the first budget of Modi government, tax free income was increased from 2 lakh to 2
 5 lakh kar diya gaya tha
 The tax exemption limit under 80C was also increased from one lakh to one and a half lakhs annually
 home lone ke byaaj ke reepement par milane vaali chhot bhi 1
 Increased from 5 lakhs to 2 lakhs
 lekin jis tarah se mahangaai bad rahi he or iconomi kii jaruratein badal rahi hai, use dekhte hue ye badhotaree bhi kaaphi nahin maani ja rahi he
 We tell you five possible big announcements in the budget, from which your earnings are going to increase without increasing salary
 1) tex free inakam limit bad sakati habjet main 3 lakh tak kii salanaa kamai ko tex free kiya ja saktaa he
 Right now it is two and a half million rupees
 agar aisa hua to 25 hajaar rupee maheene tak kamaane waalon ko koi bhi inakam tex nahin dena hoga
 2) Changes in tax slabs The government wants to save more money in the hands of the people
 isse log zyada kharch karenge or market main demand badhayenge
 As a result, production will increase and millions of people will get employment
 aisi khabaren hai ki is bajet main 10 lakh rupee tak salanaa kamai par 10 fisadi, 10 lakh se 20 lakh kii salanaa kamai par 20 fisadi or 20 lakh se zyada kamaane waalon par 30 fisadi kaa slab lagu hone vaala he
 If this happens, the puzzle of income tax will become absolutely easy
 3) 80si kii limit 2 lakh ho sakati havaise to abhi pichley bajet main hi sarkaar ne 80si kii limit ek se badhaakar 1
 5 lakhs
 lekin zyaadaatar exparts maan rahe hai ki sarkaar jis policy par chal rahi he, usase ye sanket miltaa he ki wo ye limit badhaakar kam se kam 2 lakh kar sakati he
 This is so that people invest more money in savings schemes
 isse ek to desh ke vikaas ke liye sarkaar ke haath main zyada paise aaenge or doosraa bahut badi taadaad main logon ko ek tarah kii soshal security milegi
 4) Transport allowance will increase? If you look at your salary slip, then you get Rs 800 in the name of transport allowance every month
 ye wo rakam he jo sarkaar maanati he ki aap ghar se daftar aane-jane main kharch karte hai isliye is par koi tex nahin lagata
 Not only big cities like Delhi, Mumbai, today even in small cities, 800 rupees is extremely low for the whole month
 is bajet main iske badhane ke puure chance hai
 5) Expect to increase medical reimbursement, your salary gets Rs 15,000 for a year for treatment, medicines and medical tests
 ye wo rakam hoti he jiske liye aapako medical bills jamaa karne hote hai or badale main aapako in par tex nahin dena padataa
 In today's era of inflation, there is nothing for the entire family of 15,000 rupees
 aisi khabar he ki is bajet main ye rakam badhkar 50,000 rupee hone vaali he
 When you type something on your mobile phone, such as a password or PIN or any other information, it can be easily stolen by hackers

 ' lekin chunki mobile eps evam websiton ko praaia: in sensoron main se zyaadaatar kaa istemaal karne ke liye parmishan kii jarurat nahin padati, aise main kuch asurakshit program chori chori aapke sensor se data chura sakate hai or uskaa istemaal samvedansheel jaankaree jaise ki kol karne kii timming, shaareerik gatividhi, yahaan tak ki aapke tach ection, pin or password tak kii chori ho sakati he

 Story writer Munshi Premchand became famous not only in the country but also as 'katha Samrat'
 premchand kii jayanti 31 july ko bade hi utsaah se manaai ja rahi he
 On this special occasion, read his story 'the story of two bulls' and relive your memories
 
 
 kahani: do belon kii kathajanwaron main gadhaa sabase zyada budhimaan samajha jaataa he
 When we want to call a man a first class idiot, we call him a donkey
 gadhaa sachmuch bevakoof he yaa uske sidhepan, uski niraapad sahishnutaa ne use yah padavi de di he, iskaa nishchay nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Cows kill horns, a married cow takes the form of a lioness involuntarily
 kutta bhi bahut garib jaanavar he, lekin kabhi-kabhi use bhi krodh aa hi jaataa he, kintu gadhe ko kabhi krodh karte nahin suna, na dekha
 As much as you want, kill the poor, however bad, put the rotten grass in front, there will never be a shadow of discontent on its face
 baishakh main chaahe ekaadh baar kulel kar letaa he, par hamane to use kabhi khush hote nahin dekha
 Permanent nostalgia permanently casts on his face
 sukh-dukh, haani-laabh kisi bhi dasha main use badalte nahin dekha
 All the qualities of sages and sages have reached its zenith, but the man calls him an idiot
 sadgunon kaa itnaa anadar!kadaachit sidhaapan sansar ke liye upyukt nahin he
 See, what is the plight of Indians in Africa? Why are they not allowed to enter America? Poor people do not drink alcohol, save four paise for time, work by breaking the law, do not fight with anyone, eat four things and eat gum, yet are infamous
 kaha jaataa he, ve jivan ke adarsh ko nicha karte hai
 If they had learned to answer brick with stone, they might have been called civilized
 japan kii misaal saamne he
 a single victory made him a republic among the civilized nations of the world
 lekin gadhe kaa ek chota bhai or bhi he, jo usase kam hi gadhaa he
 And that is 'bull'
 jis arth main ham 'gadhaa' kaa prayog karte hai, kuch usee se milte-julate arth main 'bachhiya ke taaoo' kaa bhi prayog karte hai
 Some people might call bulls the best of idiots, but we don't think so
 bail kabhi-kabhi martha bhi he, kabhi-kabhi adiyal bail bhi dekhne main aata he
 He expresses his dissatisfaction with many other ways, and therefore his place is inferior to that of a donkey
 jhuri k paas do bail the- hira or moti
 Handsome, hardworking, with a good height
 bahut dinon saath rahete-rahete donon main bhaichara ho gaya tha
 Both used to exchange each other in silent language, sitting face to face or nearby
 ek-duusare ke man kii baat ko kaise samajha jaataa he, ham kah nahin sakate
 Of course, there was such a secret power in them, that a man claiming superiority in life is deprived
 donon ek-duusare ko chatkar soonghakar apana prem prakat karte, kabhi-kabhi donon sing bhi mila liya karte the, vigrah ke naate se nahin, keval vinod ke bhav se, atmiyata ke bhav se, jaise donon main ghanishthata hote hi dhaul-dhappa hone lagata he
 Without it friendship is some whisper, some light, then more cannot be trusted
 jis vakt ye donon bail hal yaa gaadi main jot die jate or gardan hilaa-hilaakar chalate, us samay har ek kii cheshtaa hoti ki zyada-se-zyada boj meri hi gardan par rahe
 After opening the day after noon or evening, both of them would have licked each other and eradicated their fatigue, after getting bored in the Nandas, they would get up together, put their mouth in the Nand and sit together
 ek munh hataa letaa to doosraa bhi hataa letaa tha
 Coincidentally, Jhuri once sent Goen to her in-laws
 belon ko kya maaloom, ve kahan bheje ja rahe hai
 Understood, our owner has sold us
 apana yon bechaa janaa unhen acha laga yaa bura, koun jane, par jhuri ke saale gaya ko ghar tak goyi le jane main daanton pasinaa aa gaya
 If both of them stalked from behind, they ran right and left, holding the wheel and pulling it from the front, then both of them would push backwards
 martha to donon singe nichi karke hunkaarte
 If God had given him a voice, he would ask Jhuri, "why are you expelling the poor? We have not put any effort in serving you
" agar itani mehnat se kaam na chalata tha, or kaam le lete
 We were ready to die working for you
 hamane kabhi dane-chaare kii shikaayat nahin kii
 Whatever you fed, he ate with bowed head, then why did you give us a bench in the hands of this bloodthirsty? In the evening, both the bulls reached their new place
 din-bhar ke bhukhe the, lekin jab naand main lagaae gaye to ek ne bhi usamen munh nahin daalaa
 Was feeling heavy hearted
 jise unhone apana ghar samaj rakhaa tha, vah aaj unase chhot gaya
 This new house, new village, new man seemed to disguise him
 donon ne apni mook bhashaa main salaah kii, ek-duusare ko kanakhiyon se dekha or let gayi
 When he fell asleep in the village, both of them loudly broke the turban and went towards the house
 pagahe bahut majboot the
 It was not possible that any bull would break them, but both of them had double power at this time
 ek-ek jatke main rassiyaan tut gayi
 Jhuri woke up in the morning and saw that both the bulls are standing on the manger
 donon kii gardanon main aadha-aadha garaanv latak rahaa tha
 Knees to feet are full of mud and both have revolting affection in their eyes
 jhuri belon ko dekhakar sneh se gadgad ho gaya
 Ran and hugged them
 premalingan or chumban kaa vah drishy bada hi manohar tha
 Boys from the home and village gathered
 or taaliyaan baja-bajaakar unka swaagat karne lage
 This event was important even if the event was not unprecedented in the history of the village, the bal-sabha decided that a greeting letter should be given to both the animals and animals
 koi apane ghar se rotiyaan laayaa, koi gud, koi chokar, koi bhusi
 One child said- "no one will have such bulls
" ''duusare ne samarthan kiya- ''itani dur se donon akele chale aae
 'third said-' They are not bulls, they are men of that birth
 'iskaa pratwaad karne kaa kisi ko saahas nahin hua
 When Jhuri's lady saw the oxen at the door, she got burnt
 boli -'kaise namak-haraam bail hai ki ek din vahaan kaam na kiya, bhaag khadey hue
 'jhuri could not hear this attack on her bulls-' Why is Namak Haram? What would you have done if you had not given fodder? ”the woman said to Rob -“ You know how to feed the bulls, and everyone keeps drinking water
 'jhuri ne chidhaayaa-'chaara miltaa to kyon bhaagate ?'stri chidh gayi-'bhaage isliye ki ve log tum jaise buddhuon kii tarah bail ko sahalaate nahin, khilaate hai to ragadkar jotate bhi hai
 The two were lazy and ran away
 ab dekhuun kahaan se khali or chokar miltaa he
 i will not give anything except dried straw, eat or die
 'vahi hua
 Mazur has been instructed to give the bullock an empty dry straw
 belon ne naand main munh daalaa to feekaa-feekaa, na koi chikanahat, na koi ras !kya khaaen ? aashaa-bhari ankhon se dwaar kii ore taakane lage
 Jhuri said to Mazur - "why doesn't a little cake leave me?" "mistress will kill me
" ''churaakar daal aa
 "na dada, from behind you will say the same thing
 'duusare din jhuri kaa saalaa phir aayaa or belon ko le chalaa
 This time, he harnessed both to the cart
 do-chaar baar moti ne gaadi ko khai main giraanaa chaha, par hira ne sambhaal liya
 He was more tolerant
 sandhya-samay ghar pahunchakar usne donon ko moti rassiyon se baandha or kal kii sharaarat kaa majaa chakhaaya phir vahi sookhaa bhusa daal diya
 Applied all kinds of nutrients on both my hair
 donon belon kaa aisa apmaan kabhi na hua tha
 Jhuri also touched them with a flower stick
 uski titakaar par donon udne lagate the
 Got hit here
 aahat sammaan kii vyathaa to thi hi, us par mila sookhaa bhusa !naand kii taraf ankhen tak na uthaain
 The next day Gaya plowed the oxen in the plow, but both of them vowed not to lift their feet
 vah maarthe-maarthe thak gaya, par donon ne paanv na uthaaya
 Once, the ruthless person put a lot of poles on Hira's nose, Moti got out of control
 hal lekar bhaaga
 The plow, the rope, the gambling, the holdings, all became equal
 gale main badi-badi rassiyaan na hotin to donon pakadai main na aate
 Hira said in silent language - Running is meaningless
 'moti ne uttar diya-'tumhaari to isane jaan hi le lee thi
 "this time there will be a big beating
 ''padane do, bail kaa janm liya he to maar se kahaan tak bachenge ?''gaya do aadamiyon ke saath dauda aa rahaa he, donon ke haathon main laathiyaan hai
 'moti said -' i should show you fun too, i am coming with sticks
 'hira ne samajhaayaa-'nahin bhai ! khadey ho jaao
 "if i beat you, i will drop one or two
" ''nahin hamaari jati kaa yah dharm nahin he
 'moti buried his anger in his heart
 gaya aa pahunchaa or donon ko pakad kar le chalaa
 Kushal was skilled that he did not fight at this time, otherwise the pearl would have turned
 uske tevar dekh gaya or uske sahaayak samaj gaye ki is vakt taal janaa hi bhalmansahat he
 Today the same dry straw was brought to both of them again, both stood quietly
 ghar main log bhojan karne lage
 At that time, the little girl took two loaves and left them in the mouth of both
 us ek roti se inaki bhukh to kya shant hoti, par donon ke hriday ko maano bhojan mil gaya
 a gentleman lives here as well
 ladki bhairo kii thi
 His mother had died
 sauteli maa use maarthi rahati thi, isliye in belon se ek prakaar kii atmiyata ho gai thi
 Both would fill the day, eat poles, stick, tie them in the evening in the evening and at night the same girl would feed them two loaves
 prem ke is prasad kii yah barkat thi ki do-do gaal sookhaa bhusa khaakar bhi donon durbal na hote the, magar donon kii ankhon main rome-rome main vidroh bharaa hua tha
 One day Moti said in silent language - "now the diamond is not endured!" What do you want to do? "I will pick and throw a couple of horns
 ''lekin jaanate ho, vah pyaari ladki, jo hamen rotiyaan khilaati he, usee kii ladki he, jo is ghar kaa maalik he, yah bechaari anaath ho jaaegi
 "then throw the mistress, she kills this girl
" 'lekin aurat jaat par sing chalaanaa manaa he, yah bhul jate ho
 "you do not allow me to leave in any way, tell me, run away
 ''haa, yah main sweekaar karata, lekin itani moti rassi tuutegi kaise
 'there is a solution to this, first chew the rope a little
 phir ek jatke main jaati he
 'when the girl went away feeding the loaves at night, both the ropes started chewing, but the thick rope did not come in the mouth
 bechaare baar-baar jor lagaakar rah jate the
 Suddenly the doors of the house opened and that girl came out
 donon sir jhukaakar uskaa haath chaatane lage
 Tails of both straightened up
 usne unke maathe sehalaye or boli-'khol detii hoon, chupake se bhaag jaao, nahin to ye log maar daalenge
 Today, it is advisable at home to put Nath in their noses
 'usne garaanv khol diya, par donon chup khadey rahe
 Moti asked in his language - 'why not move now?' Heera said - 'go on, but tomorrow this orphan will suffer, everyone will doubt it
 sahsa balika chillaai-'donon foofa vaale bail bhaage je rahe hai, o dada! dada! donon bail bhaage ja rahe hai, o dada! dada! donon bail bhaage ja rahe hai, jaldi daudo
 Gaya went into a hurry and went to capture the bulls
 ve donon bhaage
 Gaya followed, and intensified, Gaya made a noise
 phir gaanv ke kuch aadamiyon ko bhi saath lene ke liye lautaa
 Both friends got a chance to escape
 sidhe daudte chale gaye
 Even having knowledge of the route
 jis parichit maarg se aae the, uskaa yahaan pataa na tha
 New villages started being found
 tab donon ek khet ke kinare khadey hokar sochane lage, ab kya karnaa chahie
 Heera said- 'I know, forgot the way
 ''tum bhi betahasha bhaage, vahiin use maar giraanaa tha
 "what would the world say if he killed her?" He should leave his religion, but why should we leave our religion? ”both were distraught with hunger
 khet main matar khadi thi
 Started grazing
 rah-rahakar aahat lete rahe the
 Nobody comes here
 jab pet bhar gaya, donon ne aazaadee kaa anubhav kiya to mast hokar uchhalane-kudane lage
 First, they both belched
 phir sing milaae or ek-duusare ko thekne lage
 Moti retreated several steps to Hira, even as he fell into the ditch
 tab use bhi krodh aa gaya
 Carefully stood up and confronted Moti
 moti ne dekha ki khel main jhagada hua chahta he to kinare hat gaya
 Hey ! What is this ? Somebody is getting bullied
 haa, sand hi he
 He came out in front
 donon mitra baglein jhaank rahe the
 The bull was like an elephant
 usase bhidana jaan se haath dhonaa he, lekin na bhidane par bhi jaan bachati najar nahin aati
 It is even approaching them
 kitni bhayankar surat he !moti ne mook-bhashaa main kaha-'bure fanse, jaan bachegi ? koi upaay socho
 Heera said in a worried voice - "he is bloated in his pride, Arju-beg will not listen
 ''bhaag kyon na chalem?''bhaagna kaayarta he
 "then die here
" banda to nau do gyaarah hota he
 "and those who run?" "then think of some measures soon!" The solution is to hurt both the men together
 main aage se ragedata hoon, tum peeche se ragedo, dohari maar padegi to bhaag khadaa hoga
 Sneak towards me, you thrust the horn into his stomach from the armpit
 jaan jokhim he, par doosraa upaay nahin he
 Both friends rushed, putting their lives in danger
 sand ko bhi sangathit shatruon se ladane kaa tajurba na tha
 He was accustomed to wrestling with an enemy
 jyon-hi hira par jhapata, moti ne peeche se daudaya
 When the bull turned towards him, Heera ran away
 sand chahta tha, ki ek-ek karke donon ko gira le, par ye donon bhi ustad the
 They never gave him a chance
 ek baar sand jhallaakar hira kaa ant kar dene ke liye chalaa ki moti ne bagal se aakar uske pet main sing bhonk diya
 When the bull came back in anger, Heera stabbed the horns in another aspect
 aakhir bechaara jakhmi hokar bhaaga or donon mitron ne dur tak uskaa peechha kiya
 Even the bull collapsed breathlessly
 tab donon ne use chhod diya
 Both friends used to go on swinging with victory
 moti ne sankethik bhashaa main kaha-'meraa ji chahta tha ki bachaa ko maar hi daalun
 'heera disdains -' Do not run horns on a fallen Barry
 ''yah sab dhong he, bairi ko aisa maarna chahie ki phir na uthe
 "now think how you will reach home
" ''pehle kuch kha len, to sochen
 In front of the pea field itself, Moti entered it
 hira manaa karata rahaa, par usne ek na suni
 Just two or four grains were eaten that the man ran with sticks and surrounded both friends, the diamond was on the ridge
 moti seenche hue khet main tha
 His hooves started sinking into the mud
 na bhaag sakaa
 got you
 hira ne dekha, sangi sankat main he to laut padaa
 Even if we get caught, we will be caught together
 rakhwalon ne use bhi pakad liya
 Both friends were locked in Kanji Haus in the morning
 donon mitron ko jivan main pehali baar aisa sabika padaa tha ki sara din biit gaya or khaane ko ek tinkaa bhi na mila
 Did not understand what sort of a saint was he
 isse to gaya phir bhi acha tha
 There were many buffaloes, many goats, many horses, many donkeys, but there was no choice in front of them, all were lying on the ground like dead
 kai to itane kamjor ho gayi the ki khadey bhi na ho sakate the
 All day the friend kept staring towards the gate, but did not seem to bring any choice
 tab donon ne diwaar kii namakeen mitti chaatni shuru kii, par isse kya tripti hoti
 Even when no food was available at night, the flame of rebellion erupted in Heera's heart
 moti se bolaa-'ab nahin rahaa jaataa moti !moti ne sir latakaae hue jawaab diya-'mujhe to maaloom hota he ki praan nikal rahe hai
 "come break the wall
" ''mujhase to ab kuch nahin hoga
 "just used to brag on this statue!" 'baade kii diwaar kachi thi
 The diamond was strong, its pointed horns were buried in the wall and when it hit hard, a chirp of clay came out
 phir to uskaa saahas badha usne daud-daudkar diwaar par chotein kin or har chot main thodi-thodi mitti giraane laga
 At the same time, the watchman of Kanji Haus came with the lantern to collect the animals
 hira kaa uddanddapann dekhakar use kai danda raseed kiye or moti-si rassi se baandh diya
 Moti stuttered and said - "I finally killed him, what did i get?" ''aisa jor maarna kis kaam kaa ki or bandhan main pad gaye
 "I will hit you vigorously, no matter how many the bonds
 ''jaan se haath dhonaa padegaa
 ''not bothered
 yon bhi to maranaa hi he
 Think, how much would have been saved if the wall had gone itself
 itane bhai yahaan band hai
 No one is active
 do-chaar din yahi haal rahaa to mar jaaenge
 "yes, that's it
" acha, to laa phir main bhi jor lagaataa hoon
 'moti also hit the horn in the wall, a little mud fell and then the courage increased, then he started thrusting the horn in the wall as if fighting an opponent
 aakhir koi do ghante kii jor-aajamaai ke baad diwaar upar se lagbhag ek haath gir gai, usne dooni shakti se doosraa dhakka maaraa to aadhi diwaar gir padi
 The fall of the wall meant that all the animals lying half-awake woke up, the three horses escaped to gallop
 phir bakriyaan nikaleen, iske baad bhens bhi khask gai, par gadhe abhi tak jyon ke tyon khadey the
 Heera asked - 'why don't you both run away?' One donkey said - 'whatever may be caught again
 ''to kya haraj he, abhi to bhaagane kaa avasar he
 "we are scared
 ham yaheen pade rahenge
 'it was past midnight
 donon gadhe abhi tak khadey soch rahe the ki bhaagen, yaa na bhaagen, or moti apane mitra kii rassi todane main laga hua tha
 When he lost, Heera said - "you go, let me stay here, maybe i will meet somewhere
" 'moti ne ankhon main aansu laakar kaha-'tum mujhe itnaa swaarthee samajhate ho, hira ham or tum itane dinon ek saath rahe hai
 Today you have fallen into trouble, may i leave you and be separated? ”heera said -“ You will get hit a lot, people will understand, this is your mischief
 'moti ne garv se bolaa-'jis aparaadh ke liye tumhaare gale main bandhana padaa, uske liye agar mujhe maar pade, to kya chintaa
 It is enough that the lives of nine-ten beings are saved, they will all bless
 'yah kehete hue moti ne donon gadhon ko singon se maar-maar kar baade se baahar nikaala or tab apane bandhu ke paas aakar so rahaa
 As soon as dawn, there was a commotion between the scribe and the watchman and other employees, there is no need to write it
 bas, itnaa hi kaaphi he ki moti kii khub marammat hui or use bhi moti rassi se baandh diya gaya
 Both friends lay there tied for a week
 kisi ne chaare kaa ek trin bhi na daalaa
 Yes, the water was shown once
 yahi unka aadhaar tha
 Both of them had become so weak that they did not even get up, the stumps had come out
 ek din baade ke saamne duggi bajane lagi or dopaher hote-hote vahaan pachaas-saath aadmi jamaa ho gaye
 Then the two friends were taken out and people would come and see their appearance and their minds would fade away
 aise mritak belon kaa koun khariddaar hota ? sahasaa ek dadhiyal aadmi, jisaki ankhen laal thim or mudra atyant kathor, aayaa or donon mitra ke kulhon main ungali godakar munshiji se baaten karne laga
 Seeing the face, the intuition of both friends was shaken
 vah kyon he or kyon tatol rahaa he, is vishay main unhen koi andeh na hua
 Both of them looked at each other with great eyes and bowed their heads
 hira ne kaha-'gaya ke ghar se naahak bhaage, ab to jaan na bachegi
 "moti replied with a sense of disrespect -" Say, God has mercy on everyone, why don't they have mercy on us? "" To live our life for God is equal
 " chalo, acha hi he, kuch din uske paas to rahenge
 Once God saved us as that girl
 kya ab na bachaayenge ?''yah aadmi churi chalaaegaa, dekh lenaa
 "so what is the concern?" Meat, skins, horns, bones will all come in handy
 'nilaam ho jane ke baad donon mitra us dadhiyal ke saath chale
 Both of them were shivering
 bechaare paanv tak na uthaa sakate the, par bhay ke maare girte-ghadte bhaage jate the, kyonki vah jaraa bhi chaal dhimi ho jane par danda jamaa detaa tha
 On the way, a raven of cow-oxen appeared grazing in a green necklace
 sabhi jaanavar prasann the, chikne, chapal
 Some used to bounce, some cheated sitting happily, what a happy life they had, but how selfish they are
 kisi ko chintaa nahin ki unke do bai badhik ke haath pade kaise duhkhi hai
 Suddenly both came to know that there is a familiar way
 haa, isi raste se gaya unhen le gaya tha
 The same fields, the same gardens, the same villages began to be found, their speed began to accelerate
 sari thakaan, sari durbalata gaayab ho gai
 Ahh ! Take this ! Lost his own
 isi kuen par ham poor chalaane aayaa karte the, yahi kuan he
 Moti said - 'our house has come close
 'hira bolaa -'bhagwaan kii dayaa he
 "I run home now
" ''yah jane degaa ?'ise main maar giraata hoon
 'no-no, run and walk on the station
 vahaan se aage ham na jaaenge
 'both of them frantically ran like a calf and ran towards the house
 vah hamaara thaan he
 Both of them came to their place and stood up
 dadhiyal bhi peeche-peeche dauda chalaa aata tha
 Jhoori was sitting in sunlight near the door
 belon ko dekhte hi dauda or unhen baari-baari se gale lagane laga
 Tears of joy were flowing from the eyes of friends
 ek jhuri kaa haath chaat rahaa tha
 The bearded man went and took hold of the ropes of the bulls
 jhuri ne kaha-'mere bail hai
 "how are your bulls?" i come auctioned from Mvesikhana
 '''main to samajhataa hoon, churaae liye jate ho! chupake se chale jaao, mere bail hai
 They will be sold only if i will sell them
 kisi ko mere bail nilaam karne kaa kya akhriyaar hai ?''jaakar thane main rapat kar doongaa
 "I have bulls
" iskaa saboot yah he ki mere dwaar par khadey hai
 The bearded jhalla grew to forcefully capture the bulls
 usee vakt moti ne sing chalaaya
 The bearded man moved back
 moti ne peechha kiya
 Beard ran
 moti peeche dauda, gaanv ke baahar nikal jane par vah rukaa, par khadaa dadhiyal kaa rasta vah dekh rahaa tha, dadhiyal dur khadaa dhamkiyaan de rahaa tha, gaaliyaan nikaal rahaa tha, pathar phenk rahaa tha, or moti vijayi shur kii bhaanti uskaa rasta roke khadaa tha
 The people of the village saw this spectacle and used to laugh
 jab dadhiyal harkar chalaa gaya to moti akadata hua lautaa
 Heera said- 'I was afraid that you might not get angry and kill
 ''ab na aayega
 "if i come, i will take news from far away
" dekhuun, kaise le jaataa he
 "the one who shoots you?" Will die, but it won't work
 ''hamaari jaan ko koi jaan hi nahin samajhataa
 "because we are so straight
" 'jaraa der main naandon main khali bhusa, chokar or dana bhar diya gaya or donon mitra khaane lage
 Jhuri Khad was caressing both of them
 vah unase lipat gaya
 Jhuri's wife also came running from within
 usne ne aakar donon belon ke maathe chuum liye

 French Prime Minister Edward Philippe has warned of more terrorist attacks in the country
 unhone kaha ki desh main november se apatkaal hataaya jayega
 The country has been under emergency since December
 tippaniyan "there may be more attacks, more tragedies, and victims in the country," Xinhua was quoted as saying by the news agency
 ham aatankwaad se ladenge
 However, the state of emergency is not permanent
 ' The Prime Minister issued the government's guidelines for the next five years and said that his staff is preparing to remove the emergency in the country from November 1
 samachar agency sinhua ne philip ke hawaale se bataaya, 'desh main or hamale, or traasadiyaan, or peedit ho sakate hai
 We will fight terrorism
 haalanki, apatkaal kii dasha sthai nahin he
 ' pradhanmantri ne agle paanch varsh ke liye sarkaar kaa dishanirdesh jari karte hue kaha ki unka staff ek november se desh main lage apatkaal ko hataane kii taiyaari kar rahaa he

 bhartiya naagarik kulbhushan jadhav ko pakistani sainya adaalat dwaara faansee kii sazaa sunaae jane ke mudde ko lekar hegg sthit antarrashtriya panchat (antarrashtriya nyaayalay yaa international court of justise yaa isije) main somvaar ko sunwaayee main bharat ne apana paksh rakh diya he
 In this regard, India has made its demands clear
 bharat or pakistan aamane-saamne hai
 Pakistan has now been given a chance to present its case
 gauratlab he ki is mudde kii vajah se donon deshon ke bich sambandh tanaavpurn ho gaye hai
 The case is being heard in the Great Hall of Justice of the Peace Palace located in the Hague, Netherlands (holland)
 isse pehle donon desh lagbhag 18 saal pehle sanyukt raashtra kii is sheersh adaalat main aamane-saamne aae the, jab pakistan ne uske nausainik vimaan ko maar giraae jane ke maamle main hastkshep kaa aagrah kiya tha
 Read, special things about hearing
 
 
 bhartiya shishtmandal kaa netritv dow deepak mittal kar rahe hai
 Harish Salve, a well-known lawyer for India, has kept the title
 bharat ne pakistan par vienna samjhaute ke ulanghan kaa aarope lagaaya
 Pakistan has violated the Vienna Agreement
 kulbhushan jadhav ko bina rajanyik mulaakaat kaa mauka die giraftaar kar rakhaa gaya, or ab un par faansee kii talwaar latak rahi he
 The execution of Kulbhushan Jadhav by Pakistani military court is a violation of rights under Article 36
 bharat dwaara anurodh kiye jane ke baavjood pakistan ne koi saboot yaa dastauez bharat ko nahin diya
 India has asked the international tribunal that Pakistan take all necessary steps to ensure that Kulbhushan Jadhav is not hanged
 anuchhed 74 ke anusaar, praavdhanik kadam uthaae jane kaa anurodh sabhi anya anurodhon kii tulana main praathamikta paaegaa
 India said that the situation is very serious, so the court has been approached in short notice
 kulbhushan ko pakistan main kathith taur par giraftaar kiya gaya
 Pakistan did not inform India
 bharat kii ore se kaha gaya ki aisapiaar (pakistani sena kaa media) ke pravaktaa ne kaha ki jadhav ke paas duutavas kii pahunch kaa adhikaar nahin he
 India wants to say this - there have been three occasions - in the Costa Rica vs Nicaragua case, in Belgium and Senegal, what was possible was attempted
 parague banaam america ke maamle main court ne yah faisla kiya tha ki america sarkaar parague ke naagarik ko duutavas kii pahunch uplabdh karaae
 In the case of Germany v
 America, the court also said that the death penalty for a German citizen would be a loss of justice
 kulbhushan ke maamle main kai kanoonee raste uplabdh hai
 He cannot be hanged while the case is going on in this court
 agar aisa hua to yah viena kanvenshan kaa ulanghan hoga
 Pakistan has not yet been assured that Kulbhushan will not be hanged until the case goes on
 bharat ne kaha ki pakistan ne daawa kiya he ki uske paas kulbhushan jadhav ke jasusi karne ke kai saboot hai
 But he rejected India's persistent requests and did not show any evidence in this case
 bharat ne saaf kaha ki jadhav par lage jasusi ke aaropon se bharat inkaar karata he
 India says that Jadhav was kidnapped from Iran and confessed while being in military custody
 pakistan ke videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa ne kulbhushan jadhav ke khilaaf aadharahin, suvichaarit or propeganda ke tahat aarope lagaae
 Pakistan's allegations lack truth
 jab se pakistan ne usko apni jameen par pakade jane kaa daawa kiya he tab se bharat ko us tak pahunch ke adhikaar se vanchit rakhaa gaya he
 India has filed a case under Article 1 of the Veena Convention
 court ne hameshaa hi duutavas kii pahunch uplabdh karai jab bhi aise maamalon main military court main cese chalaa he
 India again states that this access has not yet been provided to India
 bharat ko abhi tak kulbhushan par lage aaropon kii copy nahin di gai he
 Because of this, India has not been able to comment directly on the allegations against him
 ham kulbhushan jadhav ke maamle main kanoonee rup se apana paksh rakhana chaahate hai
 India said that she has given her views on the basis of Veena convention in this matter
 ham keval yah kahana chaahate hai ki is prakaar kii kisi bhi giraftaar ke liye sambandhit desh ko turant suchit kiya janaa chahie
 This case is prima facie a violation of the Vienna Convention

 india today group ke is kaarykram main bhartiya sena ke purv adhyaksh general veda prakaash malik, purv nausena adhyaksh admiral arun prakaash or purv vayusena adhyaksh air chif marshall es krishnaswami ne ‘border kaa bajet’ seshan ke dauraan sena ke bajet par vitt mantri ko kya karnaa chahie is par charchaa kii
 General Malik, who was the Chief of Army Staff during the Kargil War, started this discussion by stressing the need for India to become self-sufficient in the defense sector
 unhone kaha, ‘bharat apane raksha utpaadon main se 70 fisadi kii kharid karata he
 We should emphasize on exports
 ’ gauratlab he ki bharat salanaa 8 arab dollar aayaat ke saath duniya ke sabase bade raksha ayaatkon main shaamil he
 General Malik said, 'modi has a vision
 unhone kaha bhi he ki hamen raksha utpaadon ke niryaat par jor dena chahie
 The three former army chiefs emphasized on increasing the allocation for the defense sector in the budget
 haalanki, pichhali sarkaar ne antarim bajet main isamen 10 fisadi kii badhotaree kii thi
 It is noteworthy that former finance minister Chidambaram had allocated Rs 2,24,000 crore for the defense sector in the interim budget
 sena main sudhaar kaa suzav dete hue general malik ne kaha, ‘raksha utpaada pranali ko raksha mantralay se alag karne kii jarurat he
 Taking a dig at the repeated failure of DRDO (defense Research and Development Organization), former Air Chief Marshal S
 Krishnaswamy said that it has been 56 years since this organization was formed but today the army is struggling with the lack of defense equipment behind it
 There has been a shortage of DRDO
 unhone kaha, ‘diardio lagaataar nae upkarnon ko saamne laane main naakaam rahaa he
 The new government needs to pay special attention to this
 ’raksha kshetra main nijee or pratyaksh videshi nivesh (epadiai) kii jarurat par teenon purv sena pramukh ekamat dikhe
 Former Naval President Admiral Arun Prakash said, "it is the need of the hour that the government focus on opening up the defense sector to foreign companies
" raksha kshetra main epadiai kii ijaajat di jaae
 'general Malik said,' Modi government also needs to focus on resolving the issue of Line of Control (loc) with neighboring countries

 ' 92 saal se chali aa rahi rail bajet kii parampara ab khatm hone ja rahi he
 Since 1924, the railway budget, which is being presented separately from the general budget, will be merged in the general budget itself
 railway ke aadhikarik sutron kii maane to buudhvaar ko hone vaali cabinet main rail bajet ko aam bajet main milaane ke prastaav ko manjuuri de di jaaegi
 If this happens, the tradition of separate railway budget will be ingrained in history and Suresh Prabhu will be recorded as the last railway minister who presented the railway budget in Parliament
 aagaamee vitt varsh ke liye saal 2017 main ab sirf or sirfam bajtahi sansad main pesh kiya jayega
 The financial accounting of the Ministry of Railways will also be a part of the general budget in the same way as it is for the other ministry
 vaise to aam bajet main rail bajet ke marjar ke saidhantik sahmati ho gai he
 For this, the Railway Minister has already given his consent to the proposal of NITI Aayog
 buudhvaar ko cabinet kii baithak main is prastaav par muhar lag jaaegi
 According to the top officials of the Ministry of Railways, the finance ministry will now decide the budget of the Ministry of Railways, but the rights of both the ministries are still to be divided and the process for this is yet to be decided
 vitt mantralay or rail mantralay ke bich jin vishyon par abhi atim faisla hona baaki he unamem pension kii dendaree, dividend, railway ko vitt mantralay se milane vaale gros bajtary saport or kiraaya tay karne kaa adhikaar jaise masale hai
 The right to decide the fare is to be retained by the Railway Ministry
 The Ministry of Railways is seeking to retain the right to decide the fare and freight
 iske alaava rail mantralay bazaar se paisa uthaane ke adhikaar ko bhi vitt mantralay ko nahin dena chahta
 The biggest concern of the Ministry of Railways is that the burden of the Seventh Pay Commission and the sharp decrease in freight revenue
 iske chalate pehle se hi aarthik pareshaaniyon kaa dabaav jhel rahe rail mantralay ke liye divident dene se lekar oparational laagat nikaal paanaa mushkil ho rahaa he
 In such a situation, with the merger of the general budget, further difficulties in the rights of the Railway Ministry can be increased
 ye he railway kaa bajet planis saal ke railway ke bajet plan kii baat karen to 2016-17 ke dauraan railway ko karmchaariyon kii selary ke liye takreeban 70 hajaar karod rupee chahie
 Railways need about 23 thousand crores for fuel power of trains
 ritred karmchaariyon kii pension kii mad main takreeban 45 hajaar karod rupee kii jarurat he
 At the same time, to give the Government of India as a dividend, the Railways needs an amount of about 5500 crores
 rail tarriff athurity banegirelway ke jaankaron ke mutabik aam bajet main rail bajet ke vilay ke saath bhartiya railway ko vittiya taur par aazaadee mil sakegi
 With this, it is believed that Indian Railways will get freedom by giving dividends
 iske alaava rail mantralay ko ab vitt mantralay ke saamne gros bajtary saport ke liye gidgidaana nahin padegaa
 With this, it is believed that the Finance Ministry will also help in sharing the huge burden on the Railway Ministry due to the Seventh Pay Commission
 ek badi baat ye he ki rail kiraaya badhaane ke adhikaar ko lekar vitt or rail mantralay ke bich is baat par sahmati he ki aane vaale dinon main kiraye main kami or badhotaree ke liye rail tarriff athurity banaai jaaegi
 Even after the merger of the Railway Budget in the General Budget, the Ministry of Railways will be allowed to announce new trains and projects

 com / e56xy94kf7 gajiabad se sate hapur main do din pehle hui artiai kaaryakarta mangat singh tyaagi kii maut kaa maamla garmane laga he
 There has been a demand to investigate the murder case in Bankhanda village of Babugarh police station area from any other investigating agency instead of the police
 gaanvvaalon kii maang par jiladhikari rajesh kumaar singh ne maamle kii jaanch estf se karaane kaa nivedan pradesh sarkaar se kiya he
 Vijaypal, brother of the deceased and Subhash Pal, National Treasurer of the RTI Association, said that Tyagi was a very honest person
 ve artiai ke jariye bade khulaase kar rahe the or isi vajah se unki hatya kii gai ho
 In what vehicle did Mangat Singh Tyagi's assassin arrive, what was his number, how he escaped, police were looking for answers to the footage of CCTV cameras installed at the India gas godown and petrol pump near the deceased's house
 is
 godaam main kul chaar camere lage hai
 One of them is located outside the warehouse
 filon main chipa he hatyaron kaa suragartiai association ke rashtriya adhyaksh mangat singh kii hatya kyon or kisalie kii gai, iskaa raaj unke kamare main band 20 hajaar filon main chipa ho saktaa he
 He usually did not let anyone go in this room
 unke nazdikiyon kaa maananaa he ki in filon main kai vibhaagon-afasaron kaa kaala chittha he jinamein unase ranjish rakhane waalon kii jaankaree mil sakati he
 Mangat Singh Tyagi, who has been fighting for the poor, laborers and helpers for the last seven years, is also murdered for fear of big revelations of corruption
 tyaagi ne kareeb 14000 se adhik artiai daakhil kar vibhinn vibhaagon main hone vaale bhrashtachar kaa khulaasa kiya tha
 These scams exposed the Ghoda farm land scam in the Garh region, a scam of about 250 acres in the Sadar tehsil of Noida, a scam of Rs 1000 crore in village Achheja of Tehsil Hapur, and a scam of crores in Simbhali Sugar Mill
 sabase bada ghotaalaa garh kshetra ke bijli vibhaag main kareeb 225 karod rupee kaa ghapala tha jisamen tyaagi ko kai baar anjaam bhugatne kii dhamkiyaan bhi mil chuki thim
 Mangat Singh Tyagi, who started politics with Chaudhary Charan Singh, a true soldier of the RLD, and was called the Messiah of Farmers, was also a true soldier of RLD
 siyaasi dalon main punap rahe bhrashtachar ko dekh unhone raajnneeti se tauba kar lee
 About seven years ago, Mangat Singh Tyagi had set up an RTI organization and burnt the bugle against corruption
 varsh 2007 main tyaagi ne artiai association of india naam se sanstha kaa gathan kiya
 He made his headquarters in village Balkhanda
 varsh 2012 main association registerd hui to unhone upi, uttarakhand, bihar, karnataka, rajasthan, jammu-kashmir, madhyapradesh, jharkhand, chhattisgarh aadi rajyon main isaki shakhaaen kholi
 This organization has more than 20 thousand workers in nine states while the organization has filed more than 30 thousand rtis
 siyaasi maidan main yun to pakki dosti yaa dushmani jaisaa kuch nahin hota lekin dushman kaa dushman phir bhi dost ho saktaa he
 When there is such a victory chariot of saffron flag in front of which leaders like Sarathi Modi and Amit Shah, then this becomes even more relevant for the opposition parties
 yahi vajah he ki vipakshi kheme se uth rahe sur is baat kii ore ishaara kar rahe hai ki khud ko dharmanirpeksh kahalaane vaale raajnneetik dhade ne abhi se agle aam chunaav kii taiyaari shuru kar di he
 Seeds of Opposition Grand Alliance on up's land? Former CM Akhilesh Yadav, who was inaugurating the party's membership drive on Saturday, said, "whatever alliance will be formed in the country in the coming time, the Samajwadi Party will play an important role in it
 ' isse thik ek roj pehle akhilesh yadav kii dhur virdohi mayawati ne bhi saaf kiya tha ki wo bijepi ko haraane ke liye kisi bhi party se haath milaane ko taiyaar hai
 According to the news agency PTI, Mayawati said that she did not hesitate to seek support from any party in the fight against disturbances in evms
 'aisa har roj nahin hota jab ek duusare se aankh main aankh milakar naa dekhne vaali samaajawaadee party or bispi ek jaise siyaasi sur lagaaein
 Obviously after 2014 and 2017, both parties are now worrying about survival
 vichaardhaara ke masalon se to baad main bhi nipta ja saktaa he
 If we look at the data of the 2017 assembly elections, it would be shown that if the BSP had also come with the alliance of Samajwadi Party and Congress, the results might not have been so unilateral
 duusari partiyon main bhi badi bechainilekin astitv kii chintaa kai duusare kshatrapon ko bhi sata rahi he
 The BJP is having a 2-day national executive meeting on Saturday in Bhubaneswar
 baithak main naa sirf naveen patnayak kii dedh dashak se zyada puraani satta ko badalane kii ranneeti ban rahi he balki uttar-purv main party kii jameen majboot karne par bhi vichaar ho rahaa he
 The bjp's spectacular performance in the recent local elections must have raised the Odisha Chief Minister's concern
 kuch aisa hi pashchim bengal main mamata banerjee ke bare main kaha ja saktaa he
 Trinamool has no way of dealing with the bjp's ever-growing graph in the state
 kul milakar 2019 ke siyaasi mahabharat se pehle halaat aise ban rahe hai jahaan kshetreey partiyon ko vajood kii ladaai main saath aana pad saktaa he
 This type of alliance has been successful in Bihar
 haalanki desh kii raajnneeti main alag-alag ravaiye or soch kii in partiyon ko ek dhuree kii jarurat hogi or philhal congress hi ye bhoomika nibhaa sakati he
 Who will lead the opposition coalition? There are also indications in the opposition camp to find the leadership of such anti-bjp front
 haal hi main kai vipakshi netaa ensipi netaa sharad pavaar kii aatmakatha 'apni sharton par' ke hindi sanskaran kii lonching ke maukey par jute
 What CPM leader Sitaram Yechury said on the stage was worth noting in this context
 wo bole, 'sharad pavaar kii pari abhi khatm nahin hui he
 It needs to be taken forward
 vaikalpik model kaise hasil ho, is par alag raay ho sakati he
 Sharad Pawar will have to fulfill this responsibility
 jediu netaa kasee tyaagi ne bhi yechuri kii baat kaa purajor samarthan kiya
 The experience of the Third Front, however, testifies that any such experiment will succeed only if the Congress becomes its axis
 kya congress main baaki he dam?in dinon aise virale hi log milenge jo congress par daanv lagane ko taiyaar hai
 Party leaders like Mani Shankar Iyer have agreed that if the Congress wants to win now, it will have to wait until 2024
 ayyar kaa maananaa tha ki agar bijepi ko haraane ke liye agar koi mahagathbandhan banataa he to congress ko uski aguwai kaa daawa chhodane ke liye bhi taiyaar rahanaa hoga
 But there is also a truth that the Congress is still the biggest opposition party in terms of reach across the country
 pichley vidhansabha chunaav main congress 5 main se 3 rajyon main sabase badi party thi
 Therefore, it is not right to underestimate the role of Congress in any political equation against BJP
 iske ye myne nahin he ki party ko apni chhavi or charitra ko dobaaraa gadhane kii jarurat nahin hogi
 Victory on its own seems far-fetched for the party at the moment and leaving seats for other parties in the coalition will only weaken the political ground of the Congress in the long run
 saaf he ki party ke ranneetikaron ko 2019 se pehle apni praathamiktaayen saaf kerani hongi
 Now or Never! After the assembly elections of five states, the people of Gujarat and Himachal will vote this year
 iske baad rajyon main chunaav kaa silsilaa kamobesh agle aam chunaav tak jari rahegaa
 The bjp's issues and faces are already clear in front of the public, but the challenge is in front of the Opposition to formulate its strategy without losing time
 kyonki vakt or siyasat kisi ke liye nahin rukate
 Eminent playwright, actor and poet Girish Karnad believes that technology has influenced the reading habits of the youth and is missing the real pleasure of reading hardbound books
 karnad ne jaipur sahitya utsav main kaha, ‘hard bound yaa paperbaque pustakon se padhane kaa chalan yuva peedi main khatm ho chalaa he
 They no longer stick to tablets or ipads
 ’ kannada main naatak likhane vaale karnad ne kaha ki vah shiddat se mahasoos karte hai ki yuva log padhane kaa asli anand nahin uthaa paa rahe hai
 The plays of Karnad have been translated into English and other languages
 unhone kaha, ‘aisa kehane main main avashya saavdhaanee baratuunga kyonki meri umr ke logon ke liye yah sochna aam baat he ki yuva log hamaare samay jaisaa anand nahin le paa rahe hai
 Karnad said that it is natural for young people to be hypnotized towards new technology but the appeal of printed books is evergreen

 One of these Dinesh Dhruv died near Charama

 Six soldiers in the car suffered severe injuries

 The local people and some police personnel arrived on the spot and placed the injured in an ambulance

 gujarat ke ahmedabad shahar main restaurant par dhaava bolne vaale gunde abhi tak police kii pahunch se baahar hai
 There the miscreants beat the restaurant owner's rod fiercely
 yahi nahin vaardaat ke baad ek badmaash ne peedit ko dhamkee bha de daali thi
 This incident of Gundagardi is of Shree Shashi restaurant in Nana Chiloda, Ahmedabad
 maamla 12 april kaa he
 Jignesh alias Jigo Nair, a local goonda from Ahmedabad, came to eat with his friends in the restaurant
 unhone restaurant main fast food or khaanaa khaaya
 And after that those people started going from the restaurant without paying any money
 unhen jaataa dekh restaurant ke maalik kamalesh ne unhe tokaa or unase paise maange
 This thing went very exasperated to Jigo and his companions
 isi dauraan ve log restaurant maalik ko dhamkiyaan dene lage
 And passed out
 kamalesh unke peeche jane laga
 a miscreant threatened to lift the chair in his hand
 iske baad restaurant maalik waapas andar chalaa gaya
 But then a crook came back and attacked the restaurant owner with an iron rod
 us gunde ne ek ke baad ek lohe kii rod se kamalesh par 6 baar waar kiya
 The restaurant owner tried to catch the goon to defend himself
 lekin wo kaamyaab nahin hua
 Those miscreants also broke the restaurant owner's car by injuring the restaurant owner
 restaurant main koharaam machaaya
 After this, the goons left from there
 iske baad kamalesh ne fouran police se badmaashon kii shikaayat kii
 But this complaint became even more overwhelming for Kamlesh
 khud ko ilaake kaa dada kehane vaala jigo nair haath main chaaku lekar vaardaat ke agle din phir se restaurant pahunch gaya or kamalesh ko phir se dhamkee dekar vahaan se chalaa gaya
 All this incident was captured in the CCTV cameras installed there
 jinamein saaf dekha ja saktaa he ki kaise badmaashon ne restaurant main kahar barapaaya
 The biggest question is that despite all this, no policeman even burnt around the restaurant
 aisa lag rahaa he ki shahar ke police prashasan ne ek gunde ke saamne ghutane tech die hai
 The city police is reluctant to put a hand on the goon despite the complaint
 police ne shikaayat to le lee he lekin kamalesh ko nyaay milanaa abhi baaki he

" ’’ Approaching Sanjeev Kumar for the film 'angoor', Gulzar said, "let us roll our age
" " jawaab main sanjeev kumaar bole, "dekho, koun ye baat kah rahaa he!"asal main, gulzaar ne apni zyaadaatar filmo main sanjeev ko boodha dikhaaya tha
 But Gulzar remembered the 23-year-old boy who played the role of the father of the Hindi version of 'all My Sons' so beautifully that Prithviraj Kapoor, who was sitting in the audience, asked, "who is he? Gulzar knew that in the same film Who can do the most reliable of two age rolls
 sanjeev kumaar kisi methd ke actor nahin the
 Rather, he used to play a role so effortlessly that the character would dominate and the co-actor was surprisingly encouraged to give his best
 dilip kumaar-rajkpur-devanand kii tikdi se alag ve ek aise actor the bhi, jiskaa apana ek alag manarism tha
 So natural that it didn't seem like acting
 'angoor' ko yaad kariye, kitni sahajata or aasaani se koi dabl role kar jaataa he
 Of course you cannot miss Deven Verma without giving credit, but sometimes your actor gives you the best
 vah set par aate hi camera role sunate hi us kirdaar main aapako shaamil kar letaa he or is tarah ki aap camere ko bhuulakar apana sarvottam dene lagate he
 The three heroines of the film Namkeen, Waheeda Rehman-shy Tagore and Shabana Azmi, recall that they were upset with Sanjeev's lethality
 teenon ne milakar tay kiya ve sanjeev se baat nahin karegi
 But as soon as the shot was completed, the anger of the three would get evaporated
 kaaran, sanjeev itani ekirtles natural tareeke se vah shot dete ki wo apana gussa chhod deteen
 Sanjeev's entry in the introduction sequence of the song "biti Na Bitaai Raina" is a bit late
 par ve kahin se us lay-taal continuty ko brake nahin karte hai
 Gulzar was so impressed by this shot that he asked, "what do you want? Who will ask me
" ""paan khaanaa chhod do
 "sanjeev Kumar said

 "try" and "dastak" showed one of his range and "chess players" the other
 sathyajith re bhi is actor kii range jaanate the
 Check out his Comfort with Saeed jaffrey-farukh Sheikh and his Jugalbandi in 'angoor' with Deven Verma! In Hindi cinema, i consider it the best jugalbandi, which trains the audience till the last scene
 uske baad koi jugalbandi mujhe main stream cinema main shot-dar-shot ek-duusare ko compliment karti dikhi to wo thi munna or circuit! "pati, patni or wo" ke thande-thande pani se nahaana chahie vaale gane ko yaad kariye
 How many actors can be prepared to show body shape on the screen of Hindi cinema? He had the courage to look "ugly", which set him apart from others! Many pages can be written on this actor

 - Saturn gets annoyed by insulting parents and their age persons
 - hare bhare ped-paudhon ko nasht karne se shani gussa hote hai
 - Shani is not happy with the people who kill the workers and the rights of their employees
 - kisi kii jameen jaaydaad or paisa hadap lene se shani uski jindagi main andhkaar le aate hai, isliye shani ko andhkaar kaa kaarak bhi mana gaya he
 - Saturn gets angry due to not keeping the western direction of the house clean and due to waterlogging there

 After the lesson, sprinkle the steel lotus water all over the house

 ' supreme court main dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal or unki sarkaar ko fatkaar lagi, to vipaksh ko maano unhen gherne kaa mauka mil gaya
 Already, Kejriwal is accused of being busy in electoral states outside Delhi, but the Supreme Court's remarks during the dengue and chikungunya hearings were used by the opposition to sharpen the allegations
 jaise hi supreme court ne poocha ki kya kejariwal vaaki beemaari kii vajah se dengue or chikangunia ke khilaaf ranneeti banane vaali meeting main shaamil nahin hue yaa phir wo gujarat main the? vipaksh ke tamaam netaa sakriy ho gaye
 Delhi BJP said that Kejriwal's heart seems to be in Delhi these days, which will worry about dengue and chikungunya
 rashtriya mantri aar pi singh ne kaha ki dilli ke mukhyamantri ne bimariyon ko kabhi syriasli liya hi nahin, wo apana ilaaj karaane ke liye to chuttee par hote hai, lekin dilli ke log kaise pareshaan hote hai, isaki phikr nahin
 Not only this, their ministers also remain missing from Delhi, still most of their ministers are outside Delhi
 vidhansabha main vipaksh ke netaa vijendra gupta ne kaha ki supreme court kii tippanee ye bataati he ki kejariwal ke liye raajnneeti pehle he or gavarnence baad main
 Arvind Kejriwal and his party left the Delhiites as orphans and now people feel betrayed
 gupta ne aarope lagaaya ki dilli ke mukhyamantri beemaari kaa bahaanaa banaakar court ko bhi gumraah karne kii koshish kar rahe hai
 This exposes his lies and at the same time it is clear that Kejriwal's focus is now Gujarat and Punjab, where elections are going to be held in the coming months
 dilli waalon kii pareshaani yaa unki samasyaon se unhen koi lenaa-dena nahin he

 Suresh Mirage, the then police inspector of PEN, told NDTV India that not just the dead bodies were found from the spot, which was very difficult to decide whether it was a murder or something else, so i recorded the station diary and sent the samples for examination

 (input bhashaa se) In the Congress' Save the Constitution campaign, Amit Shah has retaliated shortly after Rahul Gandhi's attack
 shah ne sawaal kiya he ki ye samvidhan bachaao abhiyaan he yaa vansh bachaao abhiyaan?amit shah ne kaha ki rahul gandhi lagaataar yah kah rahe ki desh ko samvidhan congress ne diya he
 By saying this, Rahul is carrying forward his family's tradition of insulting Ambedkar
 nehru-gandhi parivaar ne ambedkar ko jivit rahete apamaanit kiya tha
 this is so embarrassing
 If there is one party that has destroyed the spirit of our Constitution, it is the Congress
 They do not want rule of democracy but they want rule of dynasty
 Hence this is a farce of a movement by their President
 https: / / t
 co / n6mwpbhirc— Amit Shah (@amitshah)april 23, 2018shah ne kaha ki agar kisi party ne samvidhan ko nuksaan pahunchaaya he to congress party hi he
 They do not believe in democracy
 ye vanshavaad ko chalaanaa chaahate hai
 The Congress party is again on the path of dividing society and spreading hatred
 piem ke liye ve lagaataar oche shabdon kaa prayog kar rahe hai
 The Congress' Save the Constitution campaign is ridiculous as well as ironic
 aazaadee ke baad se agar kisi party ne samvidhan ko nuksaan pahunchaaya he to wo sirf congress he
 It is worth noting that shortly before, Congress President Rahul Gandhi has launched a scathing attack on PM Modi and BJP government at Talkatora Stadium in Delhi
 rahul ne aarope lagaaya ki desh main jo bhi sanvaidhanik sanstha hai, unhen dabaaya ja rahaa he
 Four judges of the Supreme Court came before the public to plead for justice
 rahul ne kaha ki sarkaar ne unhen sansad main bolne se roka, agar rafel or neerav modi ke mudde par agar main 15 minute sansad main boluun to narendra modi ji khadey nahin ho paaenge

 The Supreme Court has also said in its order that since 2009 till now what is the level of underground water in entire Delhi? Where the ground water level has dropped and where it has increased

 Despite the SP-BSP alliance in Narendra Modi's fierce wave in the Lok Sabha elections, Akhilesh Yadav could not stop his party's poor defeat in Uttar Pradesh
 is haar ke baad sapa main manthan kaa daur shuru ho gaya he
 On Monday, Akhilesh Yadav and Mulayam Singh held a meeting with SP leaders throughout the day
 is baithak ke baad mana ja rahaa he ki sanghathan main bade str par badlaav kiya ja saktaa he
 Also, there is a lot of discussion that Akhilesh Yadav can return to his father Mulayam Singh's political formula to provide strength to the party again
 uttar pradesh main 90 ke dashak main mulaayam singh yadav ne sapa kii neenv rakhi thi
 Mulayam Singh took special care of the caste equation along with paying attention to the leaders associated with the land for preparing political ground in the state
 mulaayam singh ne yadav samudaay ke saath-saath muslim, obisi, dalit, rajput or brahman samudaay kaa sameekaran banaaya tha
 Interestingly, Mulayam Singh did not just pay attention to the votes of these castes but also gave special importance to the leaders of these castes in the party
 inamen kurmi samudaay ke benny prasad verma, gurjar samudaay se ramsharan das, kshatriya samudaay se mohan singh, brahman chehre ke taur par janeshwar mishra, muslim samudaay ke ajam khan, bhoomihaar samudaay se kunwar revati raman singh, yadav samudaay se ambika choudhary-parasnath yadav-balram yadav, kushvaha samudaay se harikeval prasad, shakya samudaay ke raghuraaj shakya or paasi chehre ke taur ram sagar ravat pramukh netaa the
 As a result, Mulayam Singh Yadav reached the throne of power in the first election after the formation of the party
 maujuuda samay main sapa kii kaman akhilesh yadav ke haathon main he, lekin mulaayam kii tarah se unke paas jamini netaa nahin he or jo hai bhi unhen akhilesh ne aage nahin badhaayaa he
 This fundamental difference is seen between Mulayam and Akhilesh's SP
 mulaayam jis formule ke jariye soobe se lekar desh main apni pahchaan banaai, akhilesh yadav ne usase duuri bana lee or bijepi ne soobe main apni jagah banane ke liye isi sameekaran ko apana liya
 Akhilesh Yadav, who holds the political legacy of Mulayam Singh Yadav, has suffered a crushing defeat in the third consecutive election
 pehle satta main rahete hue 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main sapa ko 5 siten mili
 All these five seats were won by members of the Mulayam family
 iske baad 2017 main akhilesh yadav apni satta ko barkaraar rakhane ke liye congress se haath milaayaa, lekin sapa ke raajnneetik itihaas main sabase kam 47 vidhayak hi jeet sake or saath hi satta bhi ganvaani padi
 After this, Akhilesh Yadav aligned with BSP supremo Mayawati to stop Narendra Modi's Vijay Rath in Uttar Pradesh in 2019, but he also failed completely in this
 basapa se gathbandhan hone ke baad bhi sapa apni paramparaagat seat kannauj, badaayun or firozabad seat ganvaa baithi
 Although SP has got five seats this time too, but these seats are Mainpuri, Azamgarh, Rampur, Moradabad and Sambhal
 jabaki basapa jiro se 10 ke aankade par pahunch gai he
 It is now believed that Akhilesh Yadav can make many changes in the organization after the party's debacle, in which there may be a holiday from the party's state president to many more leaders
 akhilesh yadav saal 2022 ke upi vidhansabha chunaav ke maddenjar sanghathan main jameen se jude netaaon ko tavajjo dene kii disha main manthan kar sakate hai
 non-yadav backward castes will be given preference in the changes in the organization
 akhilesh yadav ne sapa ke chaaron frontal sanghathan lohia vahini, samaajawaadee yuvajan sabha, mulaayam singh youth brigade or samaajawaadee chaatrasabha ko bhang karne kaa man bana chuke hai
 In the era of Mulayam Singh Yadav, the way the state president was in the hands of Ramsharan Das of Gurjar community
 isi tarah ab akhilesh yadav bhi soobe main party kii kaman ab gaiyr yadav ko de sakate hai
 Through this card, Akhilesh Yadav will try to bring the lost political land of SP by trying to bring non-yadav backward castes with him

 On which he demanded an inquiry from the then Home Minister
 videsh rajyamantri general wike singh ne kaha ki ab ek baar jab phir yah baat sabit ho gai he ki us vakt ke sarkaar ke do mantri unke khilaaf sajeesh rah rahe the or unhen sajeesh main funsana chaahate the
 Now he has written a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi demanding a high-level inquiry into the matter
 purv senadhyaksh singh kaa kahana he ki philhal vah kisi kaa naam nahin lenaa chaahate
 He still does not want to tell which ministers in the government were involved in this conspiracy
 unhone kaha ki is maamle kii ucchstareey jaanch honi chahie or koun bade log is sajeesh main shaamil the, iskaa khulaasa hona chahie
 General VK Singh also said that this whole episode affects the morale of the army
 is desh kii sena deshprem ke sarvocch maapdand tay karti he
 The Indian Army cannot even think of any such thing
 general wike singh ne kaha ki congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi or sonia gandhi se is maamle par bhartiya sena se maafee maangani chahie
 He said that the incident has been 6 years
 isaki vistrut jaankaree honi chahie
 In the interest of the country, such fake news can become a big threat to the country

 We have also demanded a meeting with the Chairman of the Standing Committee for this, to investigate who was behind it

 west indies ke captain darrin sami jab duusari baar tii20 vishwacap kii trophy lene manch par jane ke liye taiyaar ho rahe the, to us shandaar maukey par unhone jo bhaashan diya, usamen apane baagi tevar saaf taur par dikhaa die
 In the speech, he accused the West Indies Cricket Board that he was not supporting this team of champions
 west indies ke khilaadi jab khushi se uchhalte-kudate hue stadium kaa chakkar laga rahe the to yah saaf tha ki ham antarrashtriya tii20 ke pratham kunbe ke utsaah ke ufaan ko dekh rahe the
 But was it a beautiful start or the end of a seemingly impossible journey? The West Indies played in their own different style throughout the tournament — and kept triumphing over their victory song champion after each win
 unhone har baar apni jeet west indies ke logon ko samarpit kii, jinka apane khel ke prati prem kabhi bhi nahin diga, bhale hi kshetreey or antarrashtriya str par khel ke prashasan or pratispardhaa kaa maandand kitna bhi gir gaya ho
 Despite what this team has done today, this comparison may seem unfair, but Sammy, Gayle, Samuels and Russell can undoubtedly be named in the category of great players like Lloyd, Richards, Greenies and Roberts
 1975 or 1979 main ekadivasiy vishwa cap kaa khitaab apane naam kiya karne vaali west indies kii tiimon ko aaj bhi sabase mahaan tiimon kii shrenee main rakhaa jaataa he
 These teams had broken the prejudices towards their nation by their confidence and ability
 lekin aaj kii yah team! utani shashakt bhale na maani jaati ho, lekin is team ke aath khilaadi jo kolkata main vishwacap kaa final jeetne vaali team kaa hissaa the, us team main bhi the, jisane 2012 main colombo main srilanka ko haraakar tii20 kaa vishwacap jeeta tha
 This spectacular achievement of these players has also broken many socio-economic streams
 1975 main cricket jagat us uplabdhi ke liye taiyaar nahin tha, jo west indies ko is khel ke jariye hasil kerani thi—khel kii shant or samrajyavaadee lay ko apni dhuandhar aakraamakata se taar-taar kar dena
 Players such as Vivian Richards were making the Black Power aware of their aggressive game
 ve cricket team ke saath-saath gulaami se mukti kaa pratik bhi the
 They were representing the people of their country and giving voice to them
 1980 ke dashak ke madhya main jab west indies test maichon main apana dabadabaa banaae hue thi or uske tej gendbaaj or belgaum ballebaaj kahar barapaaye hue the tab bhi nazariye main khaas badlaav nahin aa sakaa or us samay kii patr-patrikaon main unke tabadatod bounsaron ke istemaal kii khub aalochana hui thi
 The mixture of joy and anger found in the current team of West Indies could also be seen in the team of that period
 mouj-masti ke jariye dukh bhul janaa caribbian parampara kaa hissaa rahaa he—darasal, ravivaar kii raat jamaica carnival main tabdeel ho gai thi
 And a friend of Carlos Braithwaite who heard the noise during the fourth six confirmed that it was the happiest moment that night
 lekin kolkata main is jeet ke baad team ke khiladinnon ne jis tarah sahaj bhavanaaen vyakt kin, vah party ke shaukeenon jaisi nahin thim
 They were full of anger and outspoken
 sampuls ne to apni kameez hi faad di or england kii team par kataaksh kiya
 He also vented his anger against Shane Warne and expressed his displeasure at the commentator Mark Nicklas himself for being "of empty mind"
 sab kuch kaa labbolubaab tha ki ''hamaara sammaan karo
 "likewise, those who see only the playboy lifestyle of Chris 'universe Boss' Gayle and his comrades are not really able to see the potential of the current greats of the West Indies
 unhone bekaar ho chuke west indies cricket board, jisane 70 or 80 ke dashak main caribbian team ke gauravshaalee dinon kaa laabh uthaane ke liye kuch bhi nahin kiya or jo maujuuda peedi ke prati sammaan kii thodi si bhaavana bhi nahin rakhata he, se apni sevaayen waapas le lee hai
 On demanding money to the best of their ability, they are dismissing them as selfish, who themselves want to benefit from their achievements
 70 ke dashak main aisi hi sthiti main puri team kairi paikar kii world siries cricket kii taraf chali gai thi
 Even if the players want to play for the money, but this does not reduce the importance of their game
 cricket main west indies kii ludhakti image yah dikhaati he ki vah aaj ke vaishvikrut jagat se pratispardhaa karne main samarth nahin he
 Therefore, any achievement that helps break their status quo must definitely be appreciated
 is uplabdhi se caribbian deshon main cricket ko lambey daur main kya phayda hone vaala he, is bare main kuch kah paanaa kathin he
 However, Cricket Board President Dave Cameron agreed to meet Sami in response to her comments
 lekin unhone aisa daant piste hue kiya he or ek email ke jariye apni bhaavana kaa izhaar kiya he, jiskaa sheershak thah ''dablooisibi adhyaksh valrd tii20 ke aayojakon ke prati atyant prashansa kaa bhav rakhata he
 “keep in mind that both men and women teams have won the World Cup this time
 west indies kaa bhavishya cricket ke us praaroop main hi dikhaai detaa he, jisamen unhone itnaa shandaar pradarshan dikhaaya he
 While the board has shown lukewarm response, the Caribbean Premier League has not delayed to respond
 iske pratinidhiyon ne chauthe-chakke ke saath mili jeet ke kuch hi minuton ke bheetar west indies ke star khiladinnon ke pradarshan kii jamkar tarif kii or bataaya ki july main jab toornament shuru hoga to vahaan ke log apane nayakon ko dekhne ke liye badi sankhya main jutenge
 Throughout the tournament, the West Indies played like a franchise team — playing in their country — and the reason was that many of their players played in the IPL
 haalanki ye log west indies ke liye team ke rup main vishwa cap 2015 ke baad se saath nahin khele the
 However, it is unlikely that the West Indies team will be able to make a big comeback in all formats of cricket after this achievement
 gail or unke saathiyon ke liye test cricket khatm-sa hi he, isliye nahin ki ve ise khelnaa nahin chaahate, yaa unamem ise khilne kii kaabiliyat nahin—gail do tihare shatak laga chuke hai—balki isliye ki paanch din ke khel main mehnat ke hisaab se utana paisa nahin he, jabaki unke paas tii20 main khilne ke liye karodon ru
 There are already many contracts
