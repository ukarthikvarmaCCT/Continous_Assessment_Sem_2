 His tenure with England from 1999 to 2007 was full of mixed results
 karston ke baad sambhavit coach ke liye flechar ke naam par charchaa chal rahi thi or unki niyukti kaa faisla yahaan bisisiai kii kaaryakari samiti kii baithak main liya gaya
 The announcement comes as a surprise as the BCCI had not given any indication that it would impose the name of the coach today
 bisisiai sachiv en shrinivasana ne baithak ke baad patrakaron se kaha, flechar ke saath anubandh do saal kaa he
 He may not be able to join the team for the West Indies tour, as he has some prior commitments
 shrinivasana ne kaha ki karston ke kaarykaal ke dauraan gendbaaji coach kaa bhaar sambhaal rahe erik simons apane isi pad par barkaraar rahenge
 Fletcher, who captained the Zimbabwe team in the 1983 World Cup, has played only six odis for the African country and his tenure as England coach has been mixed
 flechar ke kariyar kaa sarvshereshth daur tab rahaa, jab england ne 2005 main gharelu shrunkhlaa main australia par ashes shrunkhlaa or westeindies main 36 varsh baad pehali shrunkhlaa jitkar test ranking main teesraa sthaan hasil kiya tha
 The Indian team will now have a difficult responsibility on their shoulders as they take over the post of South Africa's Kirsten, who has set a high standard by ending his tenure by giving the Indian team a memorable World Cup win earlier this month
 karston ke saath bhartiya team videshon main yaadgaar jeet darj or drow khilne ke baad test ranking main sheersh par or vanade suchi main duusare number par pahunch gai thi
 He left the post to spend time with his family
 flechar england cricket team ko koching dene vaale pehle videshi coach the or yah kaarykaal unke liye utaar-chadhaav bharaa rahaa
 He is considered a very tough coach, leading England to eight consecutive Test wins
 flechar kii koching ke dauraan england ne 2005 main 1987 ke baad pehali baar star susajjit australian team ko parrast kar ashes siries apane naam kii thi
 The former Zimbabwe captain was awarded the OBE by the British royalty, but his post was questioned due to the poor form of the England cricket team
 england kii team bharat or pakistan main siries drow karaane main safal rahi, lekin 2006-07 ashes siries main australia se 0-5 se mili haar ke baad flechar kii kaaphi aalochana kii gai or is dauraan unhone apane pad se istipha dene se inkaar kar diya tha
 But his exit from the opening round of the 2007 World Cup tournament in the West Indies of England made it impossible for him to resign and he resigned

 After the current assembly elections are over, the Union government may take significant steps to ban 'triple talaq', hinting that Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad has given the SP, Congress and BSP their stand on the disputed issue
 Asked to clarify
 is baat par jor dete hue ki yah mudda kisi dharm yaa aasthaa se nahin balki mahilaon ke sammaan se judaa hua he, prasad ne kaha, ‘‘ham aasthaa kaa sammaan karte hai
 But the worship system and the misdeed cannot go together
 unhone kaha ki ek saath teen baar talaak bolne kii yah kupratha mahilaon se unka sammaan chin leti he
 He said that the Center is committed to ending this "mischief"
 ’’ gajiabad main kal shaam ek samvaadadaata sammelan ke dauraan kendriya mantri ne kaha tha, ‘‘uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaav ke baad sarkaar teen talaak pratibandhit karne kii disha main mahatvapurn kadam uthaa sakati he
 The process of assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh and four other states will end on March 11 with the results coming

 nyaay, samanta or mahilaon kaa sammaan
 The senior BJP leader said, "we are the only party that respects women
" anya dal na to mahilaon ko acchhee jagah dete hai, or na hi unka sammaan karte hai
 "sharing his war on this issue in Lucknow, Prasad said," i say that Akhilesh, Rahul and Mayawati ji should clarify their stand on the issue of triple talaq
 ’’ BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad said that the BJP in its election manifesto has promised to take sides in the Supreme Court by taking opinion from Muslim women of the state on the issue of triple talaq
 teen talaak raajnneetik rup se alag hatakar ek mudda he lekin rahul, akhilesh or mayawati is par mahilaon se koi raay nahin lenge, kyonki un par tushtikaran kii raajnneeti haaavee he
 Describing the triple talaq as an exploitative provision, he said that this question is not about any faith or religion but of women's justice, women's equality and women's respect
 koi bhi kupratha kisi aasthaa kaa hissaa nahin ho sakati
 He said that 20 Islamic countries of the world have ended the practice of triple talaq
 vahaan ise sharia main dakhlandaji nahin mana gaya
 In such a situation, how can this custom be abolished in a secular country like India against Sharia? tippaniyan Describing the alliance of Congress and SP as a coalition of corruption and crime, the Union Minister said that this is an alliance done in frustration

" ’’uttar pradesh or chaar anya rajyon main chal rahi vidhansabha chunaav kii prakriya 11 march ko parinaam aane ke saath samaapt hogi
 Emphasizing the need to put an end to this practice which has hurt the lives and dignity of women, Prasad said that the Central Government's stand was asked on behalf of the Supreme Court, on which three grounds have been responded to by our side
 
 
 Justice, equality and respect for women
 bhaajapa ke varisht netaa ne kaha, ‘‘ham ekmaatr party hai jo mahilaon kaa sammaan karti he
 Other parties neither give women a good place, nor do they respect them
 ’’ lakhanu main isi mudde ko lekar apane waar paine karte hue prasad ne kaha ‘‘main kahata hum ki akhilesh, rahul or mayawati ji teen talaak ke mudde par apane rukh spasht karen

 Three divorces are politically isolated issues, but Rahul, Akhilesh and Mayawati will not take any opinion from women on this, because they are dominated by appeasement politics
 unhone teen talaak ko ek shoshankari praavdhaan bataate hue kaha ki yah sawaal kisi imaan yaa dharm kaa nahin balki nari nyaay, nari samanta or nari sammaan kaa he
 No evil practice can be part of any faith
 unhone kaha ki duniya ke 20 islamic desh teen talaak kii pratha ko samaapt kar chuke hai
 There it was not considered an interference in the Shari'a
 aise main bharat jaise dharmanirpeksh desh main is rivaaj ko khatm kiya janaa sharia ke khilaaf kaise ho saktaa he
 The comments kendriya mantri ne congress or sapa ke gathbandhan ko bhrashtachar or aparaadh kaa gathbandhan qaraar dete hue kaha ki yah hataasha main kiya gaya gathjod he
 Describing it as the confluence of the Ganges and the Yamuna is unbecoming of these rivers
 prasad ne ek sawaal par kaha ki ram mandir kaa mudda aasthaa se judaa he
 He also indicated a very early decision in this matter pending in the Supreme Court
 unhone bhaajapa ke pradesh kii satta main aane par yantric pashu vadhashaalaayein band karne ke chunavi vaade ke auchity ke bare main puche gayi sawaal par kaha ki aisa hona hi chaiye, kyonki ve katlgahen samvidhan kii manshaa ke khilaaf hai
 Describing demonetisation as a step to make the country honest, Prasad said that it has curbed terrorism, Naxalism, hawala business, betel nut killing and body trade

 The deep controversy between the Congress and the JDU has probably ended with Rahul Gandhi's intervention after the NDA candidate was supported in the presidential election
 kaha ja rahaa he ki unhone apni party ke netaaon se nitish kumaar ke khilaaf nahin bolne kaa nirdesh diya he
 JDU has also hinted at taking a positive stance in this direction with the opposition in the Vice Presidential election
 media main ai report ke anusaar congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ne nitish kumaar kaa majbootee se paksh lete hue apane party ke netaaon se jediu pramukh kii aalochana karne se dur rahane kaa nirdesh diya he
 Bihar Pradesh Congress President Ashok Chaudhary confirmed that he had met his party vice-president Rahul Gandhi in Delhi early this week, but denied the details of the meeting
 media report ke anusaar rahul ne choudhary ko nitish ke khilaaf bayaan jari karne vaale party netaaon ke khilaaf karrwai ke sanket die
 In fact, Rahul was outside the country at the time when the dispute between the Congress and JDU was deepened
 congress or jediu ke bich vivaad congress ke varisht netaa gulam nabi aaazaad ke nitish kumaar par bihar kii beti mira kumaar kii haar sunishchit karne ke liye aagaamee 17 july ko hone vaale raashtrapati chunaav main endie ummidavaar ram nath kovind kaa samarthan karne kaa aarope lagaaya
 Azad had attacked Nitish directly, saying that those who hold one ideology take a decision while those who have many ideologies take different decisions
 aaazaad ke is tippanee ke baad pradesh ke kuch congress netaaon ne bhi jediu pramukh par waar kiya tha
 Nitish hit back at the Congress and asked why it was chosen to defeat Bihar's daughter
 upie sarkaar ke kaarykaal ke do baar avasar aae the us samay kyon nahin unhen ummidavaar banaaya
 On Azad's remarks, JDU also retaliated, saying that he was not a hanger
 nitish ke endie ummidavaar ramnath kovind kaa unke vyaktvi ko lekar samarthan kiye jane par bihar kii mahagathbandhan ke ghatak dalon congress, endie or jediu ke bich aarope-pratyarope kaa daur chalaa tha
 The differences between the Congress and the JDU may have ended after this intervention by Rahul, who had a better relationship with Nitish in a political light
 in donon dalon ke bich matbhed samaapt hone kii baat aise samay saamne ai he jab vipakshi dalon kii raashtrapati pad kii ummidavaar mira kumaar apane teen divasiy daure par bihar pahunch rahi hai
 Meira Kumar will meet Congress and RJD mlas and mps, but her meeting with Nitish is not scheduled
 jediuke rashtriya mahasachiv ke si tyaagi ne phone par aaj kaha ki aagaamee agast maheene main hone vaale uparashtrapati chunaav ko lekar vichaar vimarsh karne ke liye agar vipakshi dalon dwaara agar unki party ko aamantrit kiya jaataa he to nishchit taur par ham usamen bhaag lenge
 Tyagi also said that his party would support the joint candidate of the opposition for the vice-presidential election if JDU is approached and called to the meeting
 yah puche jane par kya ve ukt baithak main ve shaamil honge
 Tyagi said that his party's national president Nitish Kumar and senior leader Sharad Yadav will take a decision in this regard
 bihar sarkaar main shiksha mantri or congress ke pradesh adhyaksh ashok choudhary ne kaha ki ham ummid karte hai ki jediuuparashtrapati chunaavamein ham logon ke saath hogi

 Dravid told coach Duncan Fletcher to keep close attention to his game

 Amidst direct attacks by Amanatullah Khan, Dilip Pandey and Deepak Bajpai, the party's internal controversy has come to the surface due to Kumar Vishwas not getting the support of big leaders on social media
 party netaaon kii vyaktigat bayaanbaji ke baad ab kumaar vishwaas ko kaaryakartaaon kii ore se tikhe hamale bhi jhelane pad rahe hai
 The lack of coordination between Kumar Vishwas and Kejriwal Camp has been clearly seen since the in-charge of Rajasthan in the controversial meeting of the Political Affairs Committee
 aise main sawaal uthta he kya kumaar vishwaas rajasthan ke chunavi maidan main akele yuddh lard rahe hai? haal hi main rajasthan prabhariyon ke saath party daftar main hui baithak khatm hone ke baad kumaar vishwaas usee daftar main maujuud party ke bade netaaon se mulaakaat kiye bina hi laut gaye, or party ke netaaon ne bhi unase milanaa uchit nahin samajha
 Significantly, in the Aam Aadmi Party, the clap of disputes is ringing with both hands
 kumaar vishwaas ke kai bayaan hai party netaaon or kaaryakartaaon ko pasand nahi aa rahe hai

 hairaani kii baat to yah he ki saamaanya kaaryakartaaon ke twit ko share karne vaali 'aap' kii soshal media fouj kumaar vishwaas ke campan ko aage nahin badha rahi he
 Kumar Vishwas's team has started a ' # backtobasic' campaign on Twitter, but so far no major leader except Kumar Vishwas has retweeted or shared it
 yahaan tak ki aam aadmi party ke rashtriya acount par bhi kumaar kii gatividhiyaan nahin dikh rahi hai

 Talk to the passengers traveling in the 7 to 44 hours late train, their pain will not be heard from you

 The way the freedom fighter express has started running on time after prime time, will other trains also get the distinction of running on time
 bihar ke arriya zile ke jogbani se ek train aati he dilli ke anand vihaar, naam he simanchal superfast
 Ask the passengers of Seemanchal their travel experience
 shivank ne is kaam main thodi madad kar di
 When you put the number 12488 of Seemanchal Superfast train in a website called ETRAIN INFO, it was found that this train was delayed by 36-36 hours
 yah train puure saal isi tarah let chalati rahi he jabaki superfast he

 How much sadhana will he do sitting in the train, how much satisfaction and balance will be there within him, nothing happens

 How many mps will be there between Araria to Delhi, some one may have even written a letter to the Railway Minister
 na likhaa hoga to janata ne unase shikaayat kii hi hogi, par yah train ek saal se is tarah let kyon chal rahi he

 Our partners Manish and Habib visited this Patna station and took the condition of this train and passengers

 This is the daily situation of the passengers going to Kota at Patna station
 yah train jab patna se hi shuru hokar chalati he to phir 21 ghante kii deree se kaise khul sakati he
 Passengers on the platform are forced to sleep by laying sheets in the sun and heat
 ye yatri rose apane dhiraj kii pariksha lete hai ki aaj ve kitne ghante tak patna kota kaa intazaar kar sakate hai
 Passengers from all over Bihar wait for Patna to go to Kota by this train

 Parents and students all keep on trying to get someone to run their train right time
 prime time main ham koshish karenge ki rail mantri sara kaam chhod kar kal se hi patna kota express rhite time par chalava den

 On May 4, Patna was delayed by 25 hours and reached Kota late by 28 hours

 This train could not reach Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus, its journey was terminated in Kalyan
 kalyaan pahunchate pahunchate 27 ghante let ho chuki thi
 We went to the Twitter handle of the Railway Minister and saw what the passengers who are upset with the delay are writing to the Railway Minister
 hamane jaakar dekha to 7 may kii shaam 7 baje se 8 baje ke bich 65 ke kareeb logon ne twit kiye jisamen deree kii shikaayat he
 Devendra Khare (@ Devendr34836561) tweeted that Sir we are traveling from Gorakhpur to Jammu

 We were forced to stay in Jammu 24 hours
 mujhe kaam par lautne main deree ho rahi he
 @ arunjaiswal1107 tweeted that Dear @railminindia wake up from sleep
 train number 05228 34 ghante se bhi zyaada let ho chuki he
 Due to this train train number 15228 has been delayed for more than 30 hours
 pichley kuch maheene se yah ho rahaa he
 Do something tippaniyan @ Anshu74556499 Dear Sir, i am happy with the work being done in your ministry but want to bring your attention to the train number 15025 which comes from Mau to Anand Vihar
 yah train 22 ghante 50 minute kii deree se chal rahi he
 @ Shivash05243981 Sir Train No
 12685 Chennai to Mangalore Superfast Express Chennai to 5 pm instead of 5 pm
 15 baje khulne vaali he
 Can you find out the reason and inform me
 yatra kii taarikh to 5 may thi magar kai baar stesan gaye, phone kiya or ant main pataa chalaa ki train cancil ho gai
 This is the screen shot of the railway website, in which it is clearly written that Gorakhpur Dehradun is late for 44 hours
 phir cancil ho gai he
 If you want to wait for such a train, then you are late for 44 hours
 yahi ek train nahin he
 Talk to railway passengers
 7 ghante se lekar 44 ghante kii deree se chalane vaali train main safar karne vaale yatriyon se baat kiijie, unki pidaa aapse suni nahin jaaegi
 One passenger told that when fed you cancel the ticket because if you do not reach on time, then there is no benefit of going many times, in such a way that the passenger has to bear the loss if you cancel the ticket
 jis tarah se prime time ke baad swatantraaa senaanee express samay par chalane lagi he kya duusari trainon ko bhi samay se chalane kaa gaurav hasil hoga
 a train arrives from Jogbani in Araria district of Bihar, Anand Vihar in Delhi, named Seemanchal Superfast
 simanchal ke yatriyon se unki yatra kaa anubhav puuchhie
 Shivank gave some help in this work
 itrain daat info naam kii ek website main simanchal superfast train kaa number 12488 daal dekha to pataa chalaa ki yah train 36-36 ghante kii deree se chali he
 This train has been running late throughout the year while being superfast
 pichley ek saal main 323 din simanchal let chali he, 41 din cancil hui he
 The average latency is 10 hours
 adhiktam 36 ghante let he
 The Simanchal Express from Jogbani on May 5 is running late by 32 hours 36 minutes
 5 se 7 may ho gaya magar jab hamane check kiya tha tab yah train aligarh hi pahunchi thi
 Jogbani-run Seemanchal 12487 will open on May 6 with a delay of 27 hours 20 minutes
 7 may ko jogbani se chalane vaali simanchal 8 may ko ravaanaa hogi, 16 ghante let
 If this is the condition of Superfast that he will be late for 36 hours, then imagine how deep the endurance of the passengers will be
 wo train main baithkar kitni sadhana karte honge, unke bheetar kitna santosh or santulan hoga, kuch nahin hone ko lekar
 Can Railway Minister Piyush Goyal leave all the work and accept the challenge of running the Seemanchal Express on time
 arriya se dilli ke bich na jane kitne saansad hote honge, kisi na kisi ne railmantri ko patr bhi likhaa hoga
 If it was not written, the public would have complained to them, but why is this train running late in this way for a year
 meraa yakeen he ki agar aap sahi sawaal karenge to rail mantri sara kaam chhodkar vaaki simanchal express ko samay se chalava denge
 After this, we will request them to get the Patna Kota Express also run on time
 hamaare sahyogi manish or habib ne patna stesan par jaakar is train or yatriyon kaa haal liya
 There is no problem for the passengers going to Kota at Patna railway station
 patna stesan par kota jane vaale yatriyon kaa rose kaa haal yahi he
 When this train starts from Patna, then how can it open with a delay of 21 hours
 platform par yatri vahiin dhoop or lu main chadar bichhaakar sone ke liye majaboor ho jate hai
 These travelers test their endurance daily for how many hours they can wait for Patna Kota today
 is train se kota jane ke liye bihar bhar se yatri patna pahunch kar intazaar karte rahete hai
 If someone misses class, then someone misses the exam
 maa baap or chaatr sab chatpataate rahete hai ki koi inaki train rhite time chalaa de
 In prime time, we will try to leave the railway minister's work and get the Patna Kota Express to run at the right time from tomorrow itself
 unhen do trainon kaa jaldi hi uddhaar karnaa he
 One for Patna Kota Express and the other for Seemanchal Superfast running 36 hours late
 aaiye ab ham aapako patna kota express kaa kuch ricard bataate hai
 Patna Kota Express, which ran on May 1, was delayed by 21 hours from Patna and reached Kota late by 31 hours

 On May 3, 9 hours 55 minutes opened late and reached Kota with a delay of 17 hours 20 minutes
 4 may ko patna se 25 ghante kii deree se khuli or kota pahunchi 28 ghante let
 On May 5, the train opened from Patna with a delay of 19 hours and 40 minutes till the news was written
 kya railway main koi aisa he jo patna-kota express or simanchal ko samay par chalava de taaki chaatro ko pareshaani na ho
 This does not mean that two trains run properly to show us and the other trains are late
 ham let hone vaali trainon par series karte rahenge
 Now listen to the agony of passengers traveling by patna-kota Express
 kya pataa rail mantri turant sara kaam chhodkar is train ko kal hi samay par chalava den
 According to e-train

 This train has run on time only 2 times in the last one year
 ravivaar ko amritsar jane vaale ek yatri ne bataaya ki intercity band hone se sachkhand express par kaaphi dabaav bad gaya he

 He had sent a shoot from mobile with General Bogi and you see what is happening
 is video main ek aadmi dikhegaa jisane hawa main chadar baandh di he or usee main baitha safar kar rahaa he
 Many people ask if this was the case even before
 to pehle bhi reporting hoti thi
 Our own colleagues Parimal and Ravish Ranjan have reported several times inside the train at various times during festivals
 sawaal aaj kaa hona chahie
 Why all these trains are in this condition today
 kyon 36 ghante deree se chal rahi hai
 Is there no cost for the common people? aap rail yatra ke apane anubhavon ko video record kar hamen bhejie
 We will give your feedback to the Ministry of Railways through prime time
 agar koi unka adhikari dekh rahaa hoga to kya pataa train sahi samay par chalane lage
 If you ask the right questions, then the train will run on time

 On 4 May, this train left for Katihar from Delhi, reaching Katihar, it was 30 hours late
 nai train ke bheetar kaa haal dekhie
 Looks like an old train
 champaran satyagrah kaa sau saal hona kitni badi ghatana he
 If the trains run on this occasion start crawling within a month, then ask yourself if we are remembering Bapu's struggles in this way
 jab samay par nahin chalaa sakate to is train ko chalaane kii zarurat hi kya thi
 It is not that only the train coming from Bihar to Delhi is running late
 hamane abhi aapako gorakhpur dehradun express kaa haal bataaya jo 6 may ke din 44 ghante let ho jane ke kaaran cancil kar di gai

 If you want to wait for such a train, then you are late for 44 hours
 yahi ek train nahin he
 Talk to railway passengers
 7 ghante se lekar 44 ghante kii deree se chalane vaali train main safar karne vaale yatriyon se baat kiijie, unki pidaa aapse suni nahin jaaegi
 One passenger told that when fed you cancel the ticket because if you do not reach on time, then there is no benefit of going many times, in such a way that the passenger has to bear the loss if you cancel the ticket
 jis tarah se prime time ke baad swatantraaa senaanee express samay par chalane lagi he kya duusari trainon ko bhi samay se chalane kaa gaurav hasil hoga
 a train arrives from Jogbani in Araria district of Bihar, Anand Vihar in Delhi, named Seemanchal Superfast
 simanchal ke yatriyon se unki yatra kaa anubhav puuchhie
 Shivank gave some help in this work
 itrain daat info naam kii ek website main simanchal superfast train kaa number 12488 daal dekha to pataa chalaa ki yah train 36-36 ghante kii deree se chali he
 This train has been running late throughout the year while being superfast
 pichley ek saal main 323 din simanchal let chali he, 41 din cancil hui he
 The average latency is 10 hours
 adhiktam 36 ghante let he
 The Simanchal Express from Jogbani on May 5 is running late by 32 hours 36 minutes
 5 se 7 may ho gaya magar jab hamane check kiya tha tab yah train aligarh hi pahunchi thi
 Jogbani-run Seemanchal 12487 will open on May 6 with a delay of 27 hours 20 minutes
 7 may ko jogbani se chalane vaali simanchal 8 may ko ravaanaa hogi, 16 ghante let
 If this is the condition of Superfast that he will be late for 36 hours, then imagine how deep the endurance of the passengers will be
 wo train main baithkar kitni sadhana karte honge, unke bheetar kitna santosh or santulan hoga, kuch nahin hone ko lekar
 Can Railway Minister Piyush Goyal leave all the work and accept the challenge of running the Seemanchal Express on time
 arriya se dilli ke bich na jane kitne saansad hote honge, kisi na kisi ne railmantri ko patr bhi likhaa hoga
 If it was not written, the public would have complained to them, but why is this train running late in this way for a year
 meraa yakeen he ki agar aap sahi sawaal karenge to rail mantri sara kaam chhodkar vaaki simanchal express ko samay se chalava denge
 After this, we will request them to get the Patna Kota Express also run on time
 hamaare sahyogi manish or habib ne patna stesan par jaakar is train or yatriyon kaa haal liya
 There is no problem for the passengers going to Kota at Patna railway station
 patna stesan par kota jane vaale yatriyon kaa rose kaa haal yahi he
 When this train starts from Patna, then how can it open with a delay of 21 hours
 platform par yatri vahiin dhoop or lu main chadar bichhaakar sone ke liye majaboor ho jate hai
 These travelers test their endurance daily for how many hours they can wait for Patna Kota today
 is train se kota jane ke liye bihar bhar se yatri patna pahunch kar intazaar karte rahete hai
 If someone misses class, then someone misses the exam
 maa baap or chaatr sab chatpataate rahete hai ki koi inaki train rhite time chalaa de
 In prime time, we will try to leave the railway minister's work and get the Patna Kota Express to run at the right time from tomorrow itself
 unhen do trainon kaa jaldi hi uddhaar karnaa he
 One for Patna Kota Express and the other for Seemanchal Superfast running 36 hours late
 aaiye ab ham aapako patna kota express kaa kuch ricard bataate hai
 Patna Kota Express, which ran on May 1, was delayed by 21 hours from Patna and reached Kota late by 31 hours
 2 may ko paune 17 ghante der se khuli or 19 ghante 50 minute kii deree se kota pahunchi
 On May 3, 9 hours 55 minutes opened late and reached Kota with a delay of 17 hours 20 minutes
 4 may ko patna se 25 ghante kii deree se khuli or kota pahunchi 28 ghante let
 On May 5, the train opened from Patna with a delay of 19 hours and 40 minutes till the news was written
 kya railway main koi aisa he jo patna-kota express or simanchal ko samay par chalava de taaki chaatro ko pareshaani na ho
 This does not mean that two trains run properly to show us and the other trains are late
 ham let hone vaali trainon par series karte rahenge
 Now listen to the agony of passengers traveling by patna-kota Express

 According to e-train

 This train has run on time only 2 times in the last one year
 ravivaar ko amritsar jane vaale ek yatri ne bataaya ki intercity band hone se sachkhand express par kaaphi dabaav bad gaya he
 In General Bogi, the passengers are going to fly
 koi neeche so rahaa he to koi chadar baandh kar hawa main lataka he
 He had sent a shoot from mobile with General Bogi and you see what is happening
 is video main ek aadmi dikhegaa jisane hawa main chadar baandh di he or usee main baitha safar kar rahaa he
 Many people ask if this was the case even before
 to pehle bhi reporting hoti thi
 Our own colleagues Parimal and Ravish Ranjan have reported several times inside the train at various times during festivals
 sawaal aaj kaa hona chahie
 Why all these trains are in this condition today
 kyon 36 ghante deree se chal rahi hai
 Is there no cost for the common people? aap rail yatra ke apane anubhavon ko video record kar hamen bhejie
 We will give your feedback to the Ministry of Railways through prime time

 Within a month, this train has started running late for 10 to 11 hours
 katihaar se nai dilli kaa mul kiraaya 1456 rupee he

 The growing tussle between the judiciary and the government over the appointment of judges in the higher judiciary and the functioning of the collegium dominated the Supreme Court during 2016
 jahaan arunachal pradesh or uttarakhand main raashtrapati shashan lagaae jane ke maamle main modi sarkaar ko jabardast sharmindagi kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 After Prime Minister Narendra Modi's declaration of the denial of five hundred and one thousand rupee notes in the country, the issue continued to reach the top court, due to which the government's breath remained stuck
 nyaayalay ne is maamle kii lagbhag har sunwaayee par is nirnay se janata ko ho rahi pareshaaniyon ke liye sarkaar ko aade haath liya or usase kuch asahaj karne vaale sawaal bhi puche
 The court, however, denied any tampering in the demonetization decision, but later submitted several petitions regarding it to the Constitution Bench for a considered decision
 sarkaar ko vimudrikaran ke maamle main hi nyaayalay kii fatkaar nahin sunani padi balki arunachal pradesh or uttarakhand rajyon main raashtrapati shashan lagu karne ke maamle main bhi sharmasaar hona padaa
 However, there was a war of war between the judiciary and the government over the appointment of judges in the higher judiciary and both accused each other of crossing 'lakshmanrekha'
 nyaaypalika or bhaajapa ke netritv vaali rajg sarkaar ke bich talavaarein to pichley saal hi us samay khinch gai thim jab samvidhan peeth ne rashtriya nyaayik niyukti ayog kanoon nirast kar diya tha
 This tussle was further compounded this year when the apex court threatened to take up the appointment of judges on behalf of the judicial side but later, hearing a PIL, held the Center responsible for stalling the work of the judiciary

 The special thing is that there has been a lot of controversy over violence by cow guards and Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself had to say repeatedly that violence in the name of cow protection will not be tolerated
 nakvi se jab is bare main jab poocha gaya to unhone kaha ki jin rajyon main gau hatya ko lekar kanoon he vahaan is kaa sakhti se paalan kiya jayega
 He said that people should be sensitive on issues related to emotions but at the same time it is also important that there is no violence in the name of cow protection
 jab nakvi se poocha gaya ki tamaam logon kaa aarope he ki is samay desh main maahaul aisa he jisase alpsankhyakon ke man main dar bana hua he to unhone kaha ki is baat main koi sachai nahin he or yah baat bas vipaksh ke vilaap mandali ke kuch log doharaate rahete hai

 najam sethi ne yah aashaa vyakt kii ki bharat main aam chunaav ke baad jab nai sarkaar aegi to halaat badalenge
 And there is nothing better than cricket diplomacy to restore peace
 unase jab yah poocha gaya ki big thri ke samarthan ke liye kya pisibi ke bheetar se hi unpar dabaav tha to unhone sidhe-sidhe use nakaar diya
 He said that we had many reasons why we changed our stand
 jab shuru main hamane iskaa virodh kiya to nau main se teen sadsy desh hamaare saath the or hamaare paas is prastaav ko aage badhaane ke liye jaruri aath vot nahin hone kii vajah se yah aage nahin bad sakaa

 algaav vikaas ke liye sahi nahin tha
 And so we thought it appropriate to give conditional support which is still our stand
 yah in teenon deshon khaas kar bharat ke bhavishya ke cricket daura kaarykram par nirbhar karegaa
 When Sethi was asked that the performance of the Pakistani team has been poor in recent times, he said, "we have to change the nature of our domestic cricket according to the most suitable format at the international level
" saath hi unhone yah bhi bataaya ki 2015 ke world cap se pehle senior cricket team ke koching staff badale jaaenge

 darasal, adivasee ilaakon main congress majboot dikh rahi he to anusuchit jati vaali siton par ajit jogi va mayawati kaa asar dikh rahaa he
 In such a situation, if the Janata Congress and BSP alliance performed as expected, then this time the key to power can also come in their hands
 bataa den ki congress ne pichley teen chunaav main ajit jogi ko apana cheharaa banaaya tha, lekin vah raman singh ko satta se bedakhal nahin kar saki he
 However, the competition has been very close
 is baar congress jogi ke bina bijepi se takkar le rahi he

 Amar Singh lashed out at Mulayam earlier in the day, saying that he allied with Kalyan Singh, resenting the traditional Muslim base of the SP in the greed of backward votes
 unhone kaha ‘maine mulaayam singh yadav ko kabhi saanp nahin kaha
 i commented on the 'green snake in the grass' on a common basis
 ’ unhone kaha ki yah hawala ‘us kisi bhi vyakti ke liye he jo dharmanirpeksh hone kaa bahaanaa karata he or dharmanirpeksh soch ke aadhaar par gathbandhan karata he

 There is a lot of scope for rigging and external elements can be very effective
 yah ashanka niraadhaar nahin thi or kaaphi had tak aisa hota dikh bhi rahaa he
 Many big players like Sreesanth also got caught in this trap and ended their career
 kai tiimon ke maalikon par ungliyaan bhi uthin
 But the biggest shock came when it was learned that the son-in-law of n Srinivasan, the powerful President of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), is also associated with it
 is aadhaar par unase istipha bhi maanga gaya, lekin unhone us jaij maang ko thukraa diya or apane pad par jame rahe
 He also conducted an investigation
 jaahir he ki jab vah us shaktishaalee pad par majbootee se kabiz the to koi bhi jaanch nishpaksh kaise ho sakati thi
 Now that the Supreme Court has said that no investigation can be impartial while holding Srinivasan's post and should he resign, the BCCI chief would have no other way
 agar vah aisa nahin karenge to subrat roy kii hi tarah unhen bhi supreme court ke chaabuk kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he
 Now Srinivasan will have to resign
 iske baad hi ipel main spot phixing ke maamle kii nishpaksh jaanch hogi
 The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is a sports organization that not only has a lot of money but also has avenues to make money
 yah pehla mauka nahin he ki vahaan sheersh padon par baithe logon par ungali uthi ho
 In the IPL, fingers were raised on many, of which Lalit Modi is still sitting abroad
 lekin yah maamla to or bada he jisamen avaidh tareeke se paise kamaane or gaiyrkanoonee kaam karne kaa aarope bisisiai president ke damaad par laga he
 Not only this, strict action should also be taken on the basis of this investigation so that the country's most popular sport does not become infamous forever
 ise daagdar logon se bachaana hi hoga taaki karodon cricket premiyon ke vishwaas ko thes na pahunche
 Now it is time to remove the dirt of this game forever
 abhi to bas shuruyaat hui he
 Look ahead

 ) In the neighboring country of China, committing cyber crime of citizens is not new
 yahaan tak ki duniyabar main sibar aparaadhon ke peeche aksar chini nagarikon kaa hi haath hota he
 Recently, the Chinese government has taken more than 1900 suspected cyber criminals, taking strict steps in this matter
 darasal badhate sibar aparaadhon se pareshaan hokar chini sarkaar ne april mencybar aparaadhiyonke khilaaf ek vishesh abhiyaan shuru kiya tha
 Before that, the police had received more than 750 cyber related complaints
 jinamein logon kii unki nijee suchanaaen yaa phir nijee tasveeron ko saarvajanik karne kii shikaayatein sabase zyada thi
 Taking this complaint seriously, China's cyber police seized more than 23 billion private information and deleted more than 3 lakh 52 thousand illegal content

 The incidence of blackmailing citizens and money from bank accounts has increased significantly in China
 chini sarkaar ne in sabhi shikayaton ke baad karrwai karte hue 1900 se zyada sandigdh sibar aparaadhiyon ko giraftaar kiya he
 Apart from this, the government is also keeping a close eye on more than 610 websites
 maharashtra ke koregaanv bhima main daliton par hamale kii aag abhi thandi bhi nahin hui ki centre kii bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) sarkaar ke saamne ek nai mushkil aa gai he
 The Supreme Court's decision on 20 March on the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (prevention of Atrocities) Act-1989 has once again angered these communities
 darasal, supreme court main justise adarsh kumaar goyal or udai umesh lalit kii peeth ne apane faisle main kaha ki is act ke tahat darj maamalon main agrim jamaanat di ja sakati he
 Not only this, according to the Supreme Court, if he is a government employee, prior to his arrest, the appointment of the Senior Superintendent of Police will have to be obtained for his appointing authority and other ordinary people
 isse pehle na to agrim jamaanat milti thi or na hi giraftaar ke liye manjuuri leni padati thi
 The impact of this decision was seen the very next day and the Gujarat High Court granted anticipatory bail to 15 accused of the Savarna community in the case of Dalit atrocities of Jadar police station in Sabarkantha district
 jaahir he, supreme court ke faisle ko lekar daliton or adivaasiyon main baari aakrosh he
 Protests have taken place in various places
 supreme court main vakil nitin meshram kehete hai, ''supreme court ko is tarah ke legislative nechar ke faisle dene kaa adhikaar hi nahin he
 This is a decision against the constitution of the country
 ''is faisle kii najaakat ko bhaanpate hue congress ne bina deree kiye sarkaar par hamalaa bolaa or iske khilaaf supreme court main punarvichaar yachika daalane kii maang kii
 Party president Rahul Gandhi said, "BJP is working against the SC-ST community under the mentality of the Sangh and is thinking of abolishing this law
" ''lekin sirf vipaksh hi aisi maang nahin kar rahaa balki bhaajapa sarkaar main shaamil endie sahyogi lok janashakti party (lojpa) ne 26 march ko supreme court main punarvichaar yachika daal di
 LJP leader Ram Vilas Paswan acknowledged that the government should take appropriate steps on this issue for the interests of Dalits (see interview)
 khud bhaajapa main bhi daliton ke muddon ko lekar virodh ke swar ubharne lage hai
 BJP MP Udit Raj told India Today, "there is a lot of outrage among Dalits and tribals across the country about the Supreme Court's decision
 maine is masale par pradhanmantri se milane kaa vakt maanga he
 The court, in its judgment, also spoke of misuse of this law
 lekin vishvavidhyalay anudaan ayog (ujisi) ke purv chairman sukhdev thoraat durupyog kii baat tathyon par aadhaarit nahin maanateh ''supreme court ne yah faisla dete hue daliton-adivaasiyon kii saamaajik-aarthik sthiti ko dhyaan main nahin rakhaa he
 His condition is so bad that he cannot get justice
 cese main khamiyaan chodi jaati hai or aaropee chhot jate hai
 "ironically, about two and a half years ago, the Modi government amended the Act 2015 by making this law more stringent in the interests of Dalits and Adivasis
" thoraat or meshram kaa maananaa he ki daliton-adivaasiyon ko saamaajik suraksha or nyaay nahin mil paa rahaa tha, tabhi to sarkaar ne sanshodhan kiya tha
 Meshram questions, "why didn't the court then summon the SC-ST commission to present the figures and not listen to it?" Udit Raj, where the verdict is said to be motivated by caste bias, Meshram is prejudiced against judges Even the upper caste judges present in the judiciary are abusing the powers of the Supreme Court and go beyond the constitutional values
 Are also giving decisions
 '' ve nyaaypalika main daliton-adivaasiyon-alpsankhyakon kii bhagidaari or kathith bhedbhaav kaa sawaal uthaate hai
 Perhaps that is why Paswan is demanding the formation of the Indian Judicial Service
 essi-asti samudaay ke log aarakshan ko lekar bhi sarkaar se naaraaz hai (dekhen box)
 Actually, the government is working to implement reservation on the basis of department or subject in universities and it is believed that this will have an adverse effect on the reservation, because the seats are very less on the basis of department or subject

 "the UGC notification is unconstitutional," says Rahul Sonpimple, student leader of Birsa Ambedkar Phule Students Association at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU)
 iske baavjood ise jabaran lagu kiya ja rahaa he
 Protests are also taking place on reservation issues
 alam yah he ki 28 march ko bhaajapa kii saansad savitribai phule ne sarkaar ke khilaaf yah kehete hue bigul phoonk diya ki aarakshan ko khatm karne kii sajeesh rachi ja rahi he
 He also announced a movement to save reservation

 sutron ke mutabik, party kaa ek tabaka isko lekar gambhir he ki supreme court main rivyuu petishan daayar karke gend adaalat ke paale main daal di jaae
 They believe that if the government is seen to reverse this decision, then its traditional voter forward castes will be offended
 vahiin doosraa tabake kaa maananaa he ki pichley chunaavon main essi-asti samudaay apane paramparaagat dalon ko chhodkar bhaajapa kii ore muda he, agar ve bhaajapa se vimukh hue to agle chunaavon main party ko baari nuksaan ho saktaa he
 However, Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad says that the government is serious about the safety of SC-ST people
 prasad kaa kahana he, ''adaalat ne jo kaha he, sarkaar uskaa alok main samuchit tareeke se vichaar karegi
 All options are open and we will decide at the appropriate time
 ''is saal jin chaar rajyon main vidhansabha chunaav hone hai, unamem 231 siten essi-asti ke liye arakshit hai, vahiin loksabhaa main unke liye in pradeshon kii 25 siten arakshit hai
 In such a situation, if the state government does not resolve these issues soon, then the coming time may also be costly for them

 *** kapil sharma in dinon charchaa main hai
 Discussion is due to three reasons, first- to bring his girlfriend Ginni to the world
 doosraa- australia se lautate vakt flite main sunil grover se ladaai or teesraa- baari bharkam advance tex bharne ke kaaran
 The second reason is not giving up their pursuit
 ab khulaasa hua he ki aakhir kapil ne flite main aisa sunil ke saath kya kiya tha ki vivaad itnaa bad gaya or doctor mashhoor gulati ne sho tak chhod diya
 Read the full story of the quarrel here

 The Hindustan Times quoted an eyewitness present on the flight at the time of the incident - Kapil Sharma grabbed an entire bottle of whiskey
 jab cabin kru khaanaa sarv kar rahe the to us vakt vahaan maujuud puri team ne khaanaa shuru kar diya
 Kapil got angry with this
 kapil abhi bhi drink kar rahe the or unhen etraj tha ki log unke bina hi khaanaa kha rahe hai
 Kapil threw a shoe at Sunil, slapped many slaps and said - when i did not start eating, how did you take food? Kapil was shouting so loud that even the co-passengers present there were disturbed by it
 chashmadid ne bataaya- kapil ke chillane se unki team ke member itane saham gaye ki aadha khaanaa ke baad bhi plate kru member ko lautaane lage
 During this, Sunil tried to calm Kapil
 isse kapil or bhadak gaye or unhone apana juuta nikaal kar sunil ko maar diya
 Sources say that Kapil also caught Sunil's collar and slapped many
 is dauraan kai femail kru member bhi ghayal ho gai

 And brought a new show
 haalanki, tiarapy na hone kii vajah se vah sho band ho gaya tha
 If this continues, then Kapil Sharma's show will be ruined! The passengers were disturbed, some emergency was felt
 During this time many passengers were so nervous that they felt an emergency
 is dauraan kapil lagaataar punjabi main gaaliyaan die ja rahe the
 On this, the crew there said - If Kapil had not calmed down, the security would be called for the flight landing

 dakshin africa ke captain phalf du plasis ke saath bhartiya purush or mahila tiimon ke captain viraat kohli or harmanpreet cor ne is pahal kaa swaagat kiya
 Kohli said, 'the biggest tournament of T20 cricket will now be called the World Cup, which is the right name
 bharat ne 2007 main pehla tii-20 vishwa cap jeeta tha or australia main 2020 main hone vaale vishwa cap main jeet darj karnaa hamaare liye shandaar hoga
 'harmanpreet said,' i am sure that the popularity of this tournament will increase in the coming years
 ’ du plasis ne kaha, ‘har khilaadi sapana vishwa cap main khilne kaa hota he or is pahal se zyada khilaadiyon ko aisa mauka milegaa
 ' aam chunaav 2014 se pehle bhartiya janata party ke pradhanmantri pad ke daavedaranrendra modine vaada kiya ki satta main aane ke baad vah videshi bainkon main jamaakaladhandhan waapas lekar aaenge
 Now the Modi government is completing its term in power, but the government has no answer on the question of black money from abroad
 ab videsh se kalaadhan waapas laane kaa mudda pakistan main uthaaya gaya he, lekin bharat se ulat yah vaada pakistan menimran khanki sarkaar banane ke baad kiya ja rahaa he
 The Imran government of tehreek-e-pakistan has formed after the recent elections in neighboring country Pakistan
 purv cricket star imran khan pradhanmantri hai or asad umr pakistan ke nae vitt mantri hai
 After the formation of the government, Asad Omar has claimed that at present, about two and a half lakh crores of Pakistan's money is lying in foreign banks and tax havens in the name of Pakistani citizens
 asad ne vaada kiya he ki yah imran sarkaar kii praathamikta he ki vah jald se jald videshi bainkon se is paise ko pakistan laae or pakistan ke vikaas main kharch kare
 Significantly, before the 2014 general elections, Narendra Modi also claimed that about 1 in Indian banks in foreign banks
 4 lakh karod rupee kaladhan chipa he
 With this claim, Modi promised that after forming the government it would be his priority that all the black money deposited abroad would be brought back and spent on the development of the country
 aise main kya pakistan main imran sarkaar apni janata ke saath thik vaisaa samvaad karne kii koshish kar rahi he jaisaa bharat main pradhanmantri modi ne karte hue desh main apni lokapriyata main bada ijapha kiya he
 Read this: Imran will be able to handle the falling rupee-rising inflation, the falling economy of Pakistan? haalanki dubai real estate athurity kaa hawala dete hue umr ne kaha ki pakistani nagarikon kaa lagbhag 1400 karod rupaya dubai ke real estate main gaiyrkanoonee dhang se nivesh kiya gaya he
 Therefore, every pie of black money lying abroad with this money will be brought back
 donon hi deshon ke kaledhan ke mudde par ek or khaas baat he
 The Modi government formed the Spashan Investigation Team after taking command in May 2014 to curb black money and corruption in the first cabinet meeting
 ab 2018 main imran khan ne pakistan sarkaar kii bagdor sanbhaalane ke baad apni pehali cabinet baithak main task force kaa gathan karte hue use jimmedaari de di he ki vah dashakon se bhrashtachar ke jariye ekatra kiye gaye paise kii gananaa kare or use waapas pakistan laane kaa rasta taiyaar kare
 Significantly, during the tenure of the former government, Finance Minister Ishaq Dhar claimed in the Pakistani Parliament that two and a half lakh crores of Pakistani citizens are deposited in foreign banks with tax evasion
 baharhaal, ab dekhnaa yah he ki kya pakistan main yah kavayad mahaj imran khan kii lokapriyata main ijapha karne ke liye he phir vaaki imran sarkaar pakistan ko dashakon ke bhrashtachar ke daldal se baahar nikaalane kii kavayad kar rahi he

 bharat-pakistan ke bich rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar str kii baatcheet se pehle hurriyat conference ek baar phir charchaa main he
 In such a situation it becomes necessary to know some basic things about the big leaders of Hurriyat
 hurriyat conference or iske bade netaa
 
 
 The Hurriyat Conference is the largest organization of separatists in Jammu and Kashmir
 darasal, isamen 23 alag-alag dhade hai
 Some of these groups have a soft stance, and some warm
 mirwij umr farujhurriyat conference main mirwij umr faruk ke netritv vaala dhada narampanthi mana jaataa he
 The chairman of the Liberal faction Mirwaiz has been under house arrest several times before
 saiyad ali shah gilanisaiyad ali shah gilaani hurriyat conference ke kattarpanthi dhade ke netaa hai
 Gilani is known for his Pakistanism
 gilaani kaa maananaa he ki kashmir bharat kaa aantarik mudda nahin, balki yah antarrashtriya mudda he, jise isi soch ke saath hal kiya janaa chahie
 When the Indian government canceled the Foreign Secretary level talks with Pakistan earlier, they called it unfortunate
 mohammad yaccin malikyacin malik jammu-kashmir libration front (JKLF) ke adhyaksh hai
 Yasin Malik's recent stance is that he is not going to meet Pakistan National Security Advisor Sartaj Aziz
 unhone apane do varisht saathiyon gulam rasul idi or shaukat bakshi ko unase mulaakaat ke liye dilli bhejne kii baat kahi
 Yasin boycotted the assembly elections last year
 inke aage kyon jhukati he sarkaardarasal,hurriyat conferenceko jammu-kashmir ke nagarikon ke ek tabake kaa vishwaas hasil he
 On the voice of these leaders, many people of Kashmir valley come down to protest against the government
 jammu-kashmir main jitani ashaanti failegi, antarrashtriya str par utana hi kashmir kaa mudda surkhiyon main chhayega
 For these reasons, the central government cannot ignore these leaders for a long time
 aakhir kyon reeha kiye gaye algaavvaadi netaa
 
 
 The question arises that Hurriyat leaders were under house arrest before NSA level talks with Pakistan, so why were they released? Actually, the center's objective was not to keep those leaders under house arrest till the talks
 sarkaar hurriyat netaaon ke saath-saath pakistan ko bhi yah sanket dena chaahati thi ki vah vaarta ko lekar ekadam sanjeeda he or isaki raah main rode atkaaye jane par koi bhi kathor kadam uthaa sakati he
 The Center considered it necessary to just 'gesture' first through detention and then release

 isliye jab ham aatankwaad ke viruddh duniya ko aagaah karte hai to hamaari aawaaj main na keval gambhirtha hoti he, balki aakrosh bhi hota he
 The Prime Minister indirectly referred to the outrage over terrorist incidents in India by Pakistan-backed elements
 pradhanmantri ne yah bhi kaha ki 'aatankwaad ke mudde par vibhajit duniya' un siddhanton ko nuksaan pahunchaati he, jisapar sanyukt raashtra kaa nirmaan hua tha

 Therefore, when we raise our voice against terrorism, there is seriousness and resentment in it

 Hope loopholes in our judicial system are not exploited & culprits get exemplary punishment https: / / t

 Amen to that
 The guilty deserve the most severe punishment possible under law
 And to those politicians who defended the accused, vilified the victim & threatened the legal system no words of condemnation are enough

 The party wants to resolve it not through the court, but through the streets and parliament
 trinmul kii netrimamta banerjeereliyon or pradarshnon kii raajnneeti main maahir hai
 Being in this type of politics from student life, she knows what it is used for and how it can be used
 isliye unhone bengal kii ladaai ko dilli main laane kaa faisla kiya he
 This is being done under a well thought out policy so as to put pressure on the ruling party and turn the investigation into the scam

 Derek o'brien, once the country's best quiz master, has become a master of cheap things at this time
 sansad main unki bhashaa itani ugr or abhadra ho rahi he ki unke ateet ke bare main yakeen nahin hota
 Perhaps he is paying tribute to Mamata Banerjee being made a member of Rajya Sabha, otherwise a higher educated person would have heard such mild things

 It is obvious that the same question then arises that is it not a crime in parliamentary democracy to not let the house run? This is completely wrong
 iskaa matlab hua ki sadsy apane kartavyon kaa paalan nahin kar rahe hai or jaanboojhkar vyavdhaan paidaa kar rahe hai
 His intentions are clear
 yah jaanate hue bhi ki sansad main kai vidheyak lambit hai, rajya sabha kaa yun na chalane dena ek galat parampara he
 Anyway, many scholars have questioned the need of Rajya Sabha and by such behavior what does the opposition members want to show? Do they want to debate whether the Rajya Sabha is needed or not?

 yahaan loktantr ke praan basate hai
 By spreading chaos here, hurting the dignity of Parliament and fulfilling our interests is shameless

 Google Earth is a tool or software through which you can reach any corner of the world
 sach main? nahin, bilkul bhi nahin
 Because on Google Maps, many places are hidden from you or you say that they are not shown to people for security reasons
 america, china, rus or israel jaise deshon kii kai sikret jagahen map se bler kar di gai hai taaki uskaa map na banaaya ja sake
 But does the security of India's sensitive places for Google Map also matter as much as the US and China? Has the Indian government asked Google to blight sensitive places? On one hand, the Volkel Airbase of the Netherlands has been completely blamed with Google Earth, on the other hand, despite the terrorist attacks on the Pathankot airbase, this airbase has been sent via Google Earth Can be seen easily

 Yachika said, 'it is possible that the terrorists may have reached through the online map of this airbase but the government has failed to blur sensitive places with Google map'
 In this petition, the Mapathon conducted by Google in India was also criticized
 
 kyonki is event ke vinar vishaal saini ne hi pathankot shahar kii masping kii thi jisamen air force stesan bhi shaamil he
 However, Google's Mapathon has been in the question before
 2013 main sibiai ne pathankot military airforce stesan kii samvedansheel image publish karne ko lekar mapathon event kii jaanch kii gai thi
 According to a report by The Hindu, Sanjay Kumar, president of the Association of Geospan Industries has raised the question, 'how can Google block sensitive locations on the map that the government has not even given them a list?' That India has never asked to blur the sensitive map, but it does not appear to be happening
 ek angreji akhbaar kii report ke mutabik sarkaar ke aalaa adhikariyon kuch saal pehle military se jude samvedansheel jagahon ko mask karne ke liye aavedan kiya tha
 But Google has not accepted a single application citing its policy

 The comments burhanpur police ne maamle main subhash coli ko mukhya shikayatakarta banaaya he lekin enditivi ke saath baatcheet main coli ne kaha unhen jabaran gavaah banaaya gaya he
 He said that he had not informed the police
 vah ravivaar ko ek padosi kii madad karne ke liye thane gaya the jise naare lagane ke aarope main police le gai thi
 On Monday, he was in the police station, so the police made him a witness
 coli ne kaha us din naare lage lekin 'vande maataram' or 'bharat mata kii jai' ke naare lage

 unki shikaayat he police ne unase galat bayaan lekar unke gaanv mohag ke 15 logon ke khilaaf deshadroh kaa maamla darj kar liya, jabaki vah us din gaanv main maujuud tak nahin tha
 Koli has now submitted an affidavit in the court saying that the police have fabricated a false case against 15 youths
 jabaki shahpur thane ke prabharee sanjay pathak ne pehle kaha tha "subhash coli ne somvaar ko gaanv main paak kii jeet par desh virdohi naare lagane kii shikaayat kii thi
 On the basis of the complaint, a case was registered against 15 people under sections 120B (conspiracy) and 124A (anti-national activity)

 Burhanpur police has made Subhash Koli the main complainant in the case but in a conversation with NDTV, Koli said he was forcibly made a witness
 unhone kaha ki unhone police ko suchit nahin kiya tha
 He went to the police station on Sunday to help a neighbor who was taken to the police on charges of raising slogans
 somvaar ko vah thane main tha isliye police ne use hi gavaah bana diya
 Koli said that day, slogans were raised but 'vande Mataram' and 'bharat Mata Ki Jai' were raised
 subhash coli kaa pesha dish antina thik karnaa he
 His complaint is that the police registered a case of treason against 15 people of his village Mohag after taking false statements from him, even though he was not present in the village that day
 coli ne baqayada ab court main halafanama dekar kaha he ki police ne 15 yuvakon ke khilaaf jhootha cese gadha he
 Whereas in-charge of Shahpur police station, Sanjay Pathak had earlier said "subhash Koli complained on Monday about raising anti-national slogans on Pakistan's victory in the village
 shikaayat ke aadhaar par 15 logon ke khilaaf dhara 120bi (sajeesh) or 124e (desh virdohi gatividhi) ke tahat maamla darj kiya gaya tha
 ' police ab kah rahi he ki use coli ke daavon ke bare main nahin pataa

 assam main bhartiya janata party kii jeet paanch rajyon ke chunaavon kii sabase badi khabar he
 If you read all the analysis published during the Assam elections, then it will be mentioned in them that the politics of Assam has its own complexity
 vahaan kii saamaajik vividhta ke kaaran bhartiya janata party ke liye ladaai aasaan nahin he
 If those analyzes are considered correct, then the bjp's victory in this respect also becomes big
 assam main bhartiya janata party kii jeet ne use us manovaigyanik dabaav se ubaar liya he jise vah dilli or bihar kii haar ke baad mahasoos kar rahi thi
 The Bharatiya Janata Party alone won 61 seats in the 126-seat assembly
 kareeb-kareeb party ne akele hi sarkaar banane ke 63 ke aankadon ko chhu liya he
 Both its allies have also performed well
 agypi ko 14 or bodo land ko 12 siten mili hai
 Compared to the results of 2011, BJP has risen from 5 to 61
 agypi ko pichhali vidhansabha kii tulana main sirf 4 siten adhik mili hai
 The Bodo Land People's Front had 12 seats
 12 siten mili hai
 That is, the Bharatiya Janata Party has been in great advantage in terms of seats
 congress 78 siton ke saath maidan main utari thi lekin haar kar 25 par aa gai
 Badruddin Ajmal's party contested with 18 seats but remained at 13
 ajmal kii party ko nuksaan kam hua magar congress ko karant maar gaya
 According to the 2014 Lok Sabha, out of 14 seats in Assam, BJP won 7 and 36
 8 fisadi vot hasil kiye the
 BJP may have won the seats this time due to the alliance, but the vote percentage has dropped
 use 29
 Got 5 percent votes
 congress ne bihar se nahin siikhaa or gathbandhan nahin kiya
 The BJP has said that it learned from Bihar and formed an alliance
 assam kii jeet ke peeche agypi se 2011 main bijepi main aae sarbanand sonoval or 2015 main congress se bhartiya janata party main aae himanta vishwa sharma ke janaadhar kii badi bhoomika he
 Look at the charisma of politics that the former leader of the Assam Gana Parishad, which is the bjp's partner in this election, is going to become the Chief Minister
 ho saktaa he ki purv mukhyamantri prafull mahanta sonoval mantrimandal main sahyogi kii tarah kaam karen
 Himanta may again become Deputy Chief Minister
 2011 main sonoval prafull mahanta se ajmal se najdiki ke sawaal par agypi chhod bijepi main aa gaye
 Became state president of BJP within a year
 yani 2012 tak bijepi ke paas apane netaaon kaa itnaa abhaav tha ki duusare dal se aayaa vyakti saal bhar ke bheetar pradesh adhyaksh ban jaataa he
 In 2014, BJP mps are formed and ministers at the Center
 itnaa bharosa congress apane hi puraane netaa himanta vishsa sarma par nahin kar pai
 On the other hand, Himanta Vishwa, who has been accusing the BJP of corruption, takes it into his court
 isi april main iconamik times or diene kii khabar ke anusaar ek press conference main amit shah ne kaha he ki himanta ke khilaaf bhrashtachar ke jo bhi aarope lage hai uski jaanch hogi
 The newspaper has quoted the news quoting PTI
 sitambar 2015 tak himanta congress main hi the
 The great thing of the BJP is that it made Sarbananda the candidate for the chief minister and did not even allow Himanta to revolt
 udhaar ke netritv par aadhaar taiyaar kiya he rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ne
 BJP gave tickets to only 14 candidates from other parties, the rest were its own candidates
 rajya kii raajnneeti kaa adhyayan karne vaale rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ko bhi is jeet kii buniyaad daalane kaa shrey de rahe hai
 After all, what did the RSS do? assam main kaam kar chuke rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ke ek varisht sadsy se hamane baat kii
 It is not enough to tell just that the Sangh worked very hard, many things came out when they talked to find out what they did in hard work
 assam main 590 ke kareeb saraswati shishu mandir hai
 There are four and a half thousand schools with a teacher
 yah skool doordaraj ke ilaakon main chalate hai
 The teacher's training union provides for these
 yah shikshak sangh kii vichaardhaara se las hote hai
 These teachers give honorarium union of five thousand from their level, by taking donations from people and institutions
 purvottar ke chaatro ke liye assam ke bheetar 100 se adhik chatravaas chalate hai
 There is no such institution in India that has so many schools in one state
 koi privet sanstha bhi sangh se is maamle main match nahin kar sakati he
 In Assam alone, there are about twelve hundred and fifty branches of the Sangh at this time
 sangh kii ek or sanstha yahaan kaaphi kaam karti he jiskaa naam he seva bharti
 It was found in the conversation that seven thousand health workers of Seva Bharati work
 inhen swasthya rakshak kaha jaataa he
 The union gives them training in homeopathy and natural medicine which also becomes the means of their employment
 sangh 14 saal se har saal aath dinon kii ghanavantari seva yatra nikaalata he
 About 200 MBBS doctors are brought from all over the country
 inaki team aath-aath dinon tak alag-alag ilaake main camp lagaati he
 And a truck medicine is distributed among the poor by asking people
 sangh kaaryakarta ne bataaya ki ham logon ko apni vichaardhaara or seva se prabhavit karte hai
 Whoever wants to vote never says, but if someone in politics turns upside down, then it is our job to keep an eye on him
 tamaam sansthaaon se jude pandrah bees hajaar kaaryakarta chunaavon ke samay apni jimmedaari khud samaj jate hai
 Especially when their organization is abused, then they will never vote on the side that causes abuse
 isi baatcheet main ek dilachasp baat yah pataa chali ki is baar assam ke satradhikaar kaaphi naaraaz the
 As there is a monastery, so is the session in Assam
 mathadhish ko vahaan satradhikaar kehete hai
 Resentment has increased due to the occupation of Bangladeshi Muslims on the land of Sessions of Assam
 satradhikaron ne bhi sangh ko target kiye jane se naaraazgi jataai he
 Two hundred and fifty officers had talked about change
 in satron main bhakthi, nrity, sangeet kaa shikshan, prashikshan chalata he
 Do those who challenge the Sangh or talk about a Sangh-mukt Bharat, have the conviction of the Sangh's structure and the commitment of the workers
 aisa nahin he ki sangh kaa yah aadhaar hameshaa bijepi ko jeet hi dilaa detaa he lekin agar sangh se ladanaa he to ladane waalon kii taiyaari kya he
 This time 250 magistrates, ie religious monks, started talking about change
 in mathon se jude bhakton kii shrinkhalaa ne congress ke aadhaar ko bheetar hi bheetar kamjor kar diya
 Now it has to be seen whether the Congress ever used the politics of soft Hindutva through these authorities
 hamane jab yah sawaal poocha ki yah itane hi taqatvar hai to pehle kyon nahin bijepi ke paksh main badlaav kara sake
 In response to this, it was told that the Congress government's tolerance towards Bangladeshi Muslims was disenchanted and it angered the target of the Sangh
 bangladeshi musalamaanon kaa mudda bijepi rashtriya str par uthaati rahi lekin isse assam main vah jagah nahin bana saki
 Meanwhile, Badruddin became Ajmal's party and continued to win seats
 is baar ajmal khud chunaav haar gaye hai, unhen congress ke ummidavaar waajid ali choudhary ne 16,723 maton se haraa diya he
 If the Congress had similarly challenged Ajmal from the front, he would not have been accused of nurturing Muslim communalism
 jaankaar kehete hai ki ajmal ne muslim sampradayikta ko badhaava diya jisaki pratikriya main congress naram hindutv kii taraf jane ko majaboor hui
 But the same Ajmal was also supporting the UPA in 2009 from outside
 congress agar hindutv aadhaarit sampradayikta ke prati gambhir hoti to muslim sampradayita se bhi sangharsh karti
 However, Ajmal says that his party is not just a party of Muslims
 duusare dharmon ke logon ko bhi tikat detii he
 Now the Sangh says that the BJP government will have to identify and send out Bangladeshi Muslims
 kya vaaki bijepi itane bade str par musalamaanon kii pahchaan karegi or nikaalane kaa kaam karegi
 If the Sangh believes, its government will have to be tested on this basis
 bijepi ne 9 muslim ummidavaar utaare the, do hi jeet sake
 Jammu and Kashmir has the most Muslims, there is a BJP government
 uske baad assam main hai, vahaan bijepi kii sarkaar he
 The comments assam main bhartiya janata party ne muslim vot ke myth ko bhi dhwast kar diya he
 During the Lok Sabha elections it was said that there are so many Muslim majority seats in UP
 iske baad bhi bijepi ne 70 se adhik loksabhaa siten upi main jeet leen
 Separate fighting of opposing parties in UP benefited as it did in Assam
 assam main bhi congress or eudief milakar ladate to donon kaa mat pratishat bijepi se adhik hota
 The Congress neither openly challenged or shook Ajmal
 assam main muslim maton kii takat kaa andaja aap is baat se laga sakate hai ki ek baar jamiyat ulema hind ke moulana asad madani ne apni 18 maangen puri na hone par congress kii sarkaar hi gira dene kii baat kah di thi
 Neither Ajmal nor Madani has influence in the government that is being formed in Assam today
 muslim vot kii chunavi takat ko bijepi ne apni ranneeti se kamjor kar diya
 Assam's victory is big for BJP
 bijepi mukhyalay main assam kii parampara main pradhanmantri kaa swaagat ho rahaa he
 When Narendra Modi came to the BJP office as Prime Minister, he took the name of Devdas Apte
 yah vahi apte hai jo nagpur se 1963 main jansangh ke prachaarak banakar assam gaye the
 When Prime Minister came to Delhi during his political training, Apteji was the incharge of BJP headquarters
 naanaa ji deshmukh apte ji ko avadh tirhut mail se assam le gaye
 Apte ji is now 80 years old but went to Assam at the age of 24 years
 apte ji se baat kii to unhone bataaya ki lanbaa vakt lag gaya assam ko bangladeshi musalamaanon kaa masalaa samajhane main
 Apte ji formed the Anti Infiltration Committee in 1964
 tab assam kii rajdhani shilong hua karti thi
 They brought the census report from the library there
 praja socialist party ke vidhayak madhusudan das ko is masale se jod diya
 Apte ji is happy with this victory
 sangh jeet ke is drishy main shaamil nahin he par kya yah jeet uski nahin he
 It is the happiness of his loved ones
 126 siton kii vidhansabha main akele bhartiya janata party ko 61 siten mili hai
 The party has almost touched 63 figures of the government alone
 uske donon sahyogi dalon kaa bhi pradarshan acha rahaa he
 AGP has got 14 seats and Bodo Land has got 12 seats
 2011 ke nateezon se tulana karen to bijepi 5 se 61 par pahunchi he
 The AGP has got just 4 seats more than the previous assembly
 bodo land pipuls front ke paas 12 siten thim
 Has got 12 seats
 yani siton ke maamle main bhartiya janata party kaaphi phaayde main rahi he
 The Congress was in the fray with 78 seats but lost to 25
 badaruddin ajmal kii party 18 siton ke saath maidan main utari thi magar 13 par rah gai
 Ajmal's party lost less but Congress was electrocuted
 2014 ke loksabhaa ke hisaab se assam kii 14 main se bijepi ne 7 siten jiti thim or 36
 Won 8 percent of the votes
 bijepi ne is baar gathbandhan kii vajah se siten bhale hi acchhee jiti hon lekin vot pratishat uskaa gira he
 Him 29
 5 fisadi vot mili hai
 The Congress did not learn from Bihar and formed an alliance
 bijepi ne kaha he ki usne bihar se siikhaa or gathbandhan kiya
 Sarbananda Sonowal, who came to the BJP in 2011 from AGP and Himanta Vishwa Sharma from Congress in 2015, has a big role behind the Assam victory
 raajnneeti kaa karishma dekhie ki jo assam gana parishad is chunaav main bijepi kii partner he, usee kaa purv netaa mukhyamantri banane ja rahaa he
 ex-chief Minister Prafulla Mahanta Sonowal may work as an aide in the cabinet
 himanta phir se up mukhyamantri ban sakate hai
 In 2011, Sonowal left the AGP on the question of his proximity to Praful Mahanta to Ajmal and joined the BJP
 ek saal ke bheetar bijepi ke pradesh adhyaksh ban gaye
 That is, till 2012, the BJP had such a shortage of its leaders that a person from another party becomes the state president within a year
 2014 main bijepi saansad banate hai or centre main mantri
 The Congress could not rely so much on its old leader Himanta Visa Sarma
 udhar bijepi jis himanta vishwa par bhrashtachar ke aarope lagaati rahi, use apane paale main le leti he
 According to Economic Times and DNA news in April, Amit Shah has said in a press conference that any allegations of corruption against Himanta will be investigated
 akhbaar ne pitiai ke hawaale se khabar chhaapi he
 Until September 2015, Himanta was in the Congress
 bijepi kaa kamaal yah rahaa ki usne sarbanand ko mukhyamantri kaa ummidavaar banaaya or himanta ko vidroh bhi nahin karne diya
 The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh has laid the foundation on the leadership of credit
 bijepi ne duusare dalon se aae sirf 14 ummidavaaron ko hi tikat diya, baaki uske apane hi ummidavaar rahe
 Those who study the politics of the state are also giving credit to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh for laying the foundation of this victory
 aakhir kya kiya aresas ne
 We spoke to a senior member of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh who has worked in Assam
 sirf itnaa bataanaa kaaphi nahin he ki sangh ne bahut mehnat kii, mehnat main kya kiya yah jaanane ke liye jab baatcheet kii to kai baaten nikalakar ain
 There are around 590 Saraswati Shishu temples in Assam
 ek shikshak vaale saadhe chaar hajaar skool hai
 These schools run in remote areas
 inke liye shikshak kii training sangh detaa he
 These teachers are equipped with the ideology of the union
 in shikshakon ko paanch hajaar kaa maandey sangh apane str se detaa he, logon or sansthaaon se chanda lekar
 More than 100 hostels run within Assam for students from the Northeast
 bharat main koi bhi aisi sanstha nahin he jiske paas ek rajya main itane skool hon
 No private institution can match the association in this case
 akele assam main sangh kii is vakt kareeb saadhe baarah sau shakhaaen chalati hai
 Another organization of the Sangh does a lot of work here, namely Seva Bharati
 baatcheet main pataa chalaa ki seva bharti ke saat hajaar health varkar kaam karte hai
 These are called health guards
 sangh inhen homeopathy or prakritik chikitsa kaa prashikshan detaa he jo unke rojgaar kaa bhi zariyaa ban jaataa he
 The Sangh takes out eight days of Ghanvantari Seva Yatra every year for 14 years
 isamen desh bhar se kareeb 200 embibies doctor laae jate hai
 Their teams camp in different areas for eight-eight days
 or ek trek dawa logon se mangakar garibon main banti jaati he
 The Sangh worker said that we influence people with our ideology and service
 kise vot dena he kabhi nahin kehete, lekin raajnneeti main koi ulta pulta karegaa to us par najar rakhana bhi hamaara kaam he
 Fifteen and twenty thousand activists associated with all the institutions themselves understand their responsibility at the time of elections
 khaskar jab unke sanghathan ko gaali di jaati he tab ve us taraf to kabhi matdaan nahin karenge jinase gaali padati he
 In this conversation, an interesting thing came to know that this time the Assam authorities were very angry
 jaise math hota he usee tarah assam main satr hota he
 The abbot is called an authority there
 assam ke satron kii jameen par bangladeshi musalamaanon ke kabze ke kaaran naaraazgi badi he
 Officials have also expressed their displeasure over the targeting of the Sangh
 dhai sau satradhikaron ne parivartan kii baat kahi thi
 Devotion, dance, music teaching, training runs in these sessions
 sangh ko chunauti dene vaale yaa sangh mukt bharat kii baat karne waalon ko kya sangh ke is dhaanche or kaaryakartaaon kii patibaddhta kaa ilm he
 It is not that this foundation of the Sangh always gives BJP victory but if the fight is to fight the Sangh then what is the preparation of the fighters
 is baar 250 satradhikaron yani dharmik mathadhish parivartan kii baat chalaane lage
 The series of devotees associated with these monasteries weakened the Congress base within
 ab yah dekhnaa hoga ki kya congress kabhi in satradhikaron ke jariye naram hindutv kii raajnneeti karti thi
 When we asked this question that it is so powerful, why couldn't we first make a change in bjp's favor
 iske jawaab main yah bataaya gaya ki bangladeshi musalamaanon ke prati congress sarkaar kii sahansheeltaa se log aajiz aa gaye the or sangh ko target kiye jane se yah naaraaz ho gaye
 The BJP continued to raise the issue of Bangladeshi Muslims at the national level, but it could not make it to Assam
 is bich badaruddin ajmal kii party ban gai or lagaataar siten jeetne lagi
 This time Ajmal himself has lost the election, defeating Congress candidate Wajid Ali Chaudhary by 16,723 votes
 agar congress isi tarah ajmal ko saamne se chunauti detii to us par muslim sampradayikta ke poshan kaa aarope nahin lagata
 Experts say that Ajmal encouraged Muslim communalism, in response to which the Congress was forced to move towards soft Hindutva
 lekin yahi ajmal 2009 main upie ko baahar se samarthan bhi de rahe the
 If the Congress had been serious about Hindutva-based communalism, it would have also fought Muslim communalism
 haalanki ajmal kehete hai ki unki party sirf musalamaanon kii party nahin hai
 Also gives tickets to people of other religions
 ab sangh kaa kahana he ki bijepi sarkaar ko bangladeshi musalamaanon kii pahchaan kar unhen baahar bhejnaa hoga
 Will the BJP really identify and remove Muslims on such a large scale? sangh kii maane to is aadhaar par uski sarkaar kii pariksha honi he
 BJP fielded 9 Muslim candidates, only two could win
 jammu-kashmir main sabase adhik musalmaan hai, vahaan bijepi kii sarkaar he
 Thereafter in Assam, there is a BJP government
 tippaniyan In Assam, the Bharatiya Janata Party has also dispelled the myth of the Muslim vote
 loksabhaa chunaavon ke dauraan kaha jaataa tha ki upi main itani siten muslim bahul hai
 Even after this, BJP won more than 70 Lok Sabha seats in UP
 upi main virdohi dalon ke alag ladane se laabh mila jaise assam main mila
 In Assam too, if Congress and AUDF were to fight together, the vote percentage of both would be higher than BJP
 congress ne na to ajmal ko khulkar chunauti di na hi haath milaayaa
 You can gauge the strength of Muslim votes in Assam from the fact that once the Maulana Asad Madni of Jamiat Ulema Hind had said that the Congress government was toppled if its 18 demands were not met
 aaj assam main jo sarkaar ban rahi he usamen na to ajmal kaa asar he na madani kaa
 The BJP weakened the electoral strength of the Muslim vote by its strategy
 assam kii jeet bijepi ke liye badi he
 The Prime Minister is being welcomed in the Assam tradition at the BJP headquarters
 jab pradhanmantri banakar narendra modi bijepi daftar main aae the tab unhone devdas apte kaa naam liya tha
 This is the same Apte who went to Assam from Nagpur in 1963 as a Jan Sangh pracharak
 jab pradhanmantri apane raajnneetik prashikshan ke daur main dilli aae the tab apte ji hi bijepi mukhyalay ke incharge the
 Nana ji took Deshmukh Apte from Awadh Tirhut Mail to Assam
 apte ji abhi 80 saal ke hai lekin 24 saal kii umr main assam gaye the
 When he spoke to Apte, he told that it took a long time to convince Assam about the issue of Bangladeshi Muslims
 apte ji ne 1964 main anti infiltreshan cameti banaai
 The capital of Assam was then Shillong
 vahaan kii librari se sensos kii report lekar aae
 Praja Socialist Party MLA Madhusudan Das was associated with this issue
 apte ji is jeet par khush hai
 The Sangh is not involved in this scene of victory but it is not his victory
 uske apano kii hi khushi he
 The Congress did not learn from Bihar and formed an alliance
 bijepi ne kaha he ki usne bihar se siikhaa or gathbandhan kiya
 Sarbananda Sonowal, who came to the BJP in 2011 from AGP and Himanta Vishwa Sharma from Congress in 2015, has a big role behind the Assam victory
 raajnneeti kaa karishma dekhie ki jo assam gana parishad is chunaav main bijepi kii partner he, usee kaa purv netaa mukhyamantri banane ja rahaa he

 himanta phir se up mukhyamantri ban sakate hai
 In 2011, Sonowal left the AGP on the question of his proximity to Praful Mahanta to Ajmal and joined the BJP
 ek saal ke bheetar bijepi ke pradesh adhyaksh ban gaye
 That is, till 2012, the BJP had such a shortage of its leaders that a person from another party becomes the state president within a year
 2014 main bijepi saansad banate hai or centre main mantri
 The Congress could not rely so much on its old leader Himanta Visa Sarma
 udhar bijepi jis himanta vishwa par bhrashtachar ke aarope lagaati rahi, use apane paale main le leti he
 According to Economic Times and DNA news in April, Amit Shah has said in a press conference that any allegations of corruption against Himanta will be investigated
 akhbaar ne pitiai ke hawaale se khabar chhaapi he
 Until September 2015, Himanta was in the Congress
 bijepi kaa kamaal yah rahaa ki usne sarbanand ko mukhyamantri kaa ummidavaar banaaya or himanta ko vidroh bhi nahin karne diya
 The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh has laid the foundation on the leadership of credit
 bijepi ne duusare dalon se aae sirf 14 ummidavaaron ko hi tikat diya, baaki uske apane hi ummidavaar rahe

 aakhir kya kiya aresas ne
 We spoke to a senior member of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh who has worked in Assam
 sirf itnaa bataanaa kaaphi nahin he ki sangh ne bahut mehnat kii, mehnat main kya kiya yah jaanane ke liye jab baatcheet kii to kai baaten nikalakar ain
 There are around 590 Saraswati Shishu temples in Assam
 ek shikshak vaale saadhe chaar hajaar skool hai
 These schools run in remote areas
 inke liye shikshak kii training sangh detaa he
 These teachers are equipped with the ideology of the union
 in shikshakon ko paanch hajaar kaa maandey sangh apane str se detaa he, logon or sansthaaon se chanda lekar
 More than 100 hostels run within Assam for students from the Northeast
 bharat main koi bhi aisi sanstha nahin he jiske paas ek rajya main itane skool hon
 No private institution can match the association in this case
 akele assam main sangh kii is vakt kareeb saadhe baarah sau shakhaaen chalati hai
 Another organization of the Sangh does a lot of work here, namely Seva Bharati
 baatcheet main pataa chalaa ki seva bharti ke saat hajaar health varkar kaam karte hai
 These are called health guards
 sangh inhen homeopathy or prakritik chikitsa kaa prashikshan detaa he jo unke rojgaar kaa bhi zariyaa ban jaataa he
 The Sangh takes out eight days of Ghanvantari Seva Yatra every year for 14 years
 isamen desh bhar se kareeb 200 embibies doctor laae jate hai
 Their teams camp in different areas for eight-eight days
 or ek trek dawa logon se mangakar garibon main banti jaati he
 The Sangh worker said that we influence people with our ideology and service
 kise vot dena he kabhi nahin kehete, lekin raajnneeti main koi ulta pulta karegaa to us par najar rakhana bhi hamaara kaam he
 Fifteen and twenty thousand activists associated with all the institutions themselves understand their responsibility at the time of elections
 khaskar jab unke sanghathan ko gaali di jaati he tab ve us taraf to kabhi matdaan nahin karenge jinase gaali padati he
 In this conversation, an interesting thing came to know that this time the Assam authorities were very angry
 jaise math hota he usee tarah assam main satr hota he
 The abbot is called an authority there
 assam ke satron kii jameen par bangladeshi musalamaanon ke kabze ke kaaran naaraazgi badi he
 Officials have also expressed their displeasure over the targeting of the Sangh
 dhai sau satradhikaron ne parivartan kii baat kahi thi
 Devotion, dance, music teaching, training runs in these sessions
 sangh ko chunauti dene vaale yaa sangh mukt bharat kii baat karne waalon ko kya sangh ke is dhaanche or kaaryakartaaon kii patibaddhta kaa ilm he
 It is not that this foundation of the Sangh always gives BJP victory but if the fight is to fight the Sangh then what is the preparation of the fighters
 is baar 250 satradhikaron yani dharmik mathadhish parivartan kii baat chalaane lage
 The series of devotees associated with these monasteries weakened the Congress base within
 ab yah dekhnaa hoga ki kya congress kabhi in satradhikaron ke jariye naram hindutv kii raajnneeti karti thi
 When we asked this question that it is so powerful, why couldn't we first make a change in bjp's favor
 iske jawaab main yah bataaya gaya ki bangladeshi musalamaanon ke prati congress sarkaar kii sahansheeltaa se log aajiz aa gaye the or sangh ko target kiye jane se yah naaraaz ho gaye
 The BJP continued to raise the issue of Bangladeshi Muslims at the national level, but it could not make it to Assam
 is bich badaruddin ajmal kii party ban gai or lagaataar siten jeetne lagi
 This time Ajmal himself has lost the election, defeating Congress candidate Wajid Ali Chaudhary by 16,723 votes
 agar congress isi tarah ajmal ko saamne se chunauti detii to us par muslim sampradayikta ke poshan kaa aarope nahin lagata
 Experts say that Ajmal encouraged Muslim communalism, in response to which the Congress was forced to move towards soft Hindutva
 lekin yahi ajmal 2009 main upie ko baahar se samarthan bhi de rahe the
 If the Congress had been serious about Hindutva-based communalism, it would have also fought Muslim communalism
 haalanki ajmal kehete hai ki unki party sirf musalamaanon kii party nahin hai
 Also gives tickets to people of other religions
 ab sangh kaa kahana he ki bijepi sarkaar ko bangladeshi musalamaanon kii pahchaan kar unhen baahar bhejnaa hoga
 Will the BJP really identify and remove Muslims on such a large scale? sangh kii maane to is aadhaar par uski sarkaar kii pariksha honi he
 BJP fielded 9 Muslim candidates, only two could win
 jammu-kashmir main sabase adhik musalmaan hai, vahaan bijepi kii sarkaar he
 Thereafter in Assam, there is a BJP government
 tippaniyan In Assam, the Bharatiya Janata Party has also dispelled the myth of the Muslim vote
 loksabhaa chunaavon ke dauraan kaha jaataa tha ki upi main itani siten muslim bahul hai
 Even after this, BJP won more than 70 Lok Sabha seats in UP
 upi main virdohi dalon ke alag ladane se laabh mila jaise assam main mila
 In Assam too, if Congress and AUDF were to fight together, the vote percentage of both would be higher than BJP
 congress ne na to ajmal ko khulkar chunauti di na hi haath milaayaa
 You can gauge the strength of Muslim votes in Assam from the fact that once the Maulana Asad Madni of Jamiat Ulema Hind had said that the Congress government was toppled if its 18 demands were not met
 aaj assam main jo sarkaar ban rahi he usamen na to ajmal kaa asar he na madani kaa
 The BJP weakened the electoral strength of the Muslim vote by its strategy
 assam kii jeet bijepi ke liye badi he
 The Prime Minister is being welcomed in the Assam tradition at the BJP headquarters
 jab pradhanmantri banakar narendra modi bijepi daftar main aae the tab unhone devdas apte kaa naam liya tha
 This is the same Apte who went to Assam from Nagpur in 1963 as a Jan Sangh pracharak
 jab pradhanmantri apane raajnneetik prashikshan ke daur main dilli aae the tab apte ji hi bijepi mukhyalay ke incharge the
 Nana ji took Deshmukh Apte from Awadh Tirhut Mail to Assam
 apte ji abhi 80 saal ke hai lekin 24 saal kii umr main assam gaye the
 When he spoke to Apte, he told that it took a long time to convince Assam about the issue of Bangladeshi Muslims
 apte ji ne 1964 main anti infiltreshan cameti banaai
 The capital of Assam was then Shillong
 vahaan kii librari se sensos kii report lekar aae
 Praja Socialist Party MLA Madhusudan Das was associated with this issue
 apte ji is jeet par khush hai
 The Sangh is not involved in this scene of victory but it is not his victory
 uske apano kii hi khushi he
 In 2011, Sonowal left the AGP on the question of his proximity to Praful Mahanta to Ajmal and joined the BJP
 ek saal ke bheetar bijepi ke pradesh adhyaksh ban gaye
 That is, till 2012, the BJP had such a shortage of its leaders that a person from another party becomes the state president within a year
 2014 main bijepi saansad banate hai or centre main mantri
 The Congress could not rely so much on its old leader Himanta Visa Sarma
 udhar bijepi jis himanta vishwa par bhrashtachar ke aarope lagaati rahi, use apane paale main le leti he
 According to Economic Times and DNA news in April, Amit Shah has said in a press conference that any allegations of corruption against Himanta will be investigated
 akhbaar ne pitiai ke hawaale se khabar chhaapi he
 Until September 2015, Himanta was in the Congress
 bijepi kaa kamaal yah rahaa ki usne sarbanand ko mukhyamantri kaa ummidavaar banaaya or himanta ko vidroh bhi nahin karne diya
 The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh has laid the foundation on the leadership of credit
 bijepi ne duusare dalon se aae sirf 14 ummidavaaron ko hi tikat diya, baaki uske apane hi ummidavaar rahe
