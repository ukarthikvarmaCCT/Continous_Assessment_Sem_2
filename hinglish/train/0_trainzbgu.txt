 agar aap iti kshetra main naukari karnaa chaahate hai or opako intervyuu ke liye bulaayaa gaya he to aap sidhe intervyuu ke liye naa jaaen
 Before going for the interview keep some things in mind, so that you do not face any problem during the interview
 aaie jaanate hai intervyuu se pehle kin-kin baton kaa dhyaan rakhaa janaa chahie
 - Prepare résumé according to IT - When you go for an interview, it is necessary to take the résumé with you and it represents you
 iti sector ke liye rigeume banaate vakt usamen apane field se judi hui chizon kaa zikr karen
 Many times we make a résumé by looking at the résumé of someone else, so do not do this and mention technical things based on your work
 kar lijie ye 5 kaam, offis main rahegaa tension free maahaul- sawaalon ke jawaab ke liye taiyaar rahen-iti intervyuu main aikyuu ke sawaalon ke saath iti sambandhi sawaal bhi puche jate hai
 In which information about how to do a job or any technical work can be sought, so be prepared to answer technical and field related questions
 - prajntesan yaa demo-jab aap intervyuu ke liye jaaen to pehle hi apane paas kaam kaa record rakh len
 After that, during the interview, you can tell about your program or your achievement etc
 ye chijen aap ek prajntesan yaa kisi record ke liye jariye dikhaa sakate hai
 Do this work with less effort, sitting at home will be good income! - Do not give wrong information - Many times people offer their biodata in a big way to get the job
 lekin aisa karne se interview ke dauraan ulta asar bhi pard saktaa he
 So do not do this and if you have any problem in any question, then do not answer it instead of giving wrong answer
 - haav bhav or shaareerik bhashaa-kisi bhi intervyuu main non varbal communication kaa mahatv hota he
 The things that we cannot express by speaking to anyone are seen in our body language or gestures
 kisi sawaal kaa jawaab dete hue aapke chehre par galat kism ke expressant negative count ho sakate he
 The word 'lok' used in democracy is free from all the narrowness in its vast expanse
 'lok' jati-dharm-bhashaa-kshetra-varg aadi samooh kii sanyukt samaveshi ikai he, jisamen sashastitv kaa udaar bhav sakriy rahakar 'lok' ko aadhaar detaa he
 It is necessary to have everyone's sympathy for everyone in 'lok'
 isi se 'lok' ek ikai ke rup main sangathit hokar apni jivan-shakti arjeet karata he
 The liberal idea of 'live and let live' is the guiding principle of Lok Sabha and based on this principle, 'lok' has established democracy as an autonomous 'system' for justice, equality and peace in all governance systems
 i have validated the best
 swatantraaa-prapti ke saath bharat ne loktantric vyavastha ko sweekaar kiya
 The line presented at the beginning of our Constitution is' We the people of India
 
 
 ' hamaari samaveshi prakruti kii sakshi he
 In this 'we', the sense of 'all' is - not of any class, varna, sect, group, etc
 yah 'ham' shabd 'survey bhavantu sukhinah' kii ore ingit karata he
 This 'we' contains a generous spirit of welfare and upliftment of all Indians
 'sabakaa saath, sabakaa vikaas' iskaa sankalp he or isi sankalp kii sampoorti main hamaari swatantraaa evam swaittata kii sarthakata he
 There is a need to accept this truth honestly in contemporary context - 'lok' (public) as well as 'tantra' (leadership-administration)
 yah vichaarneey he ki saidhantik str par desh kii ekta or akhandta ke prati patibaddhta kaa sankalp nirantar dohraane or saamaajik-nyaay, samanta evam samarasata ke lok lubhaavan naare oochhaalane vaale hamaare 'tantra' ne vyaavhaarik dharaatal par satta par abaadh adhikaar paane kii durasha main vot bank banane ke liye 'lok' ko anek samoohon main baantne kii jo kuta rachanaaen rachin unke kaaran aaj hamaara loktantr bhayaavah samasyaon se grast he
 The provocative speeches, the efforts of the 'group-specific' interests in place of all the 'folk', the violent politics, and the alleged politics entangled in the arithmetic of statistics, have filled life with dissatisfaction, unrest, insecurity and fear
 'lok' kii nirankushta or 'tantra' kii taanaashaahee swatantraaa kaa path kantakakirn kar rahi he
 On the one hand, 'lok' is resorting to violence on the pretext of so-called movements, vehicles are being burnt, innocents are being killed, milk is being shed on roads, vegetables are being thrown, public life is being disturbed-- That is, all that is happening in a democracy should not be done by the 'lok' (people)
 duusari ore 'tantra' kahin ugr aandolankariyon par laathiyaan-goliyaan barsaata najar aata he to kabhi unki uchit-anuchit maangon ko sweekaar karata, muaavja baantata or ghutane tekta dikhaai detaa he
 Both conditions are detrimental to the health of democracy
 hamaari vartmaan uparyukt sthiti ke liye tantra kii satta lolupata, satta paane ke liye samooh athwa varg vishesh ke tushtikaran kii pravriti tathaa jati-dharm aadhaarit vot bank kii dooshit raajnneeti uttaradaayi he
 In democracy, power is the medium of service to the people, not the fulfillment of luxury feudal aspirations
 seva ke path par sangharsh nahin hota kintu adhikadhik sukh-suvidha sanchay kii chahat, janata kii gadhi kamai ke bal par vyaktigat vilasitaayen jutaney kii ichha raajnneetik dalon ke madhya galakat spardhaa paidaa karti he
 Unfortunately, our democracy is headed in this direction
 satta ke rath ko vilasita ke pankil-path se virat kar seva or tyaag ke path par agrasar karnaa aaj praathamikta ban gai he
 Today, constitution has become essential in public political life because the words uttered by the people in the big posts decide the course of action of the people
 hamaare netritv main vaksanyam kaa abhaav hamaare samaaj par dushprabhav daal rahaa he
 Perhaps in Indian politics, soon after the attainment of independence, it was rife with blame
 isiilie prakhyat kavi pandit shyaamanarayan pandeya ne san 1956 main prakashit 'shivaji' mahakavy main chetavanee di thi-unmatta bhaashan khor netadesh ko bahaka na den 
 Do not disturb the life of attached disciplined subjects
 
 Today, the consequences of showing negligence to the warning given to us by Mahakavi nearly sixty years ago are before us
 vartmaan saamaajik raajnneetik sthitiyaan is tathy kii sakshi hai
 Unfortunately, today 'lok' is divided into various political parties
 prayek saadhaaran naagarik pratyaksh-apratyaksh rup se vichaar ke str par kisi naa kisi dal ke nikat he or usee ke netaa kii baat par puri tarah vishwaas karata he- chaahe vah baat sahi ho athwa nahin
 This situation is worrisome
 apni pasand ke netaa par vishwaas karnaa sahaj swaabhaavik he kintu uske galat nirnyon kaa bhi aankh mundakar samarthan karnaa loktantr ke hit main nahin he
 This cannot be said to be appropriate under any circumstances
 saamanytah 'lok' apane 'tantra' dwaara nirdeshit path par aage badhata he kintu vartmaan pratikul paristhitiyon main 'lok' ko aage badhkar 'tantra' kaa maargdarshan karne kii aavashyaktaa he
 Due to the suicidal politics of appeasement entangled in the electoral arithmetic of votes, 'tantra' is not able to give right direction to its 'lok'
 atah 'lok' ko 'app deepo bhav' ke siddhant par apane kalyaan kaa path swayan nirmit karnaa hoga
 Those doing politics for the interests of the groups in the party will have to show the right direction and this will be possible only when the 'lok' group is overcome by the narrow mindset of the interests of the particular group, sacrificing personal interests and devoted service to the whole society
 Reveal social workers working in Tantra, do not allow Bahubalis with criminal background to enter Tantra
 'lok' kii aisi sakriyata se hi 'tantra' main sudhaar sambhav hoga or hamaara loktantr apni vikaas-yatra satat jari rakh sakegaa
 Turning democracy into a mob is a dangerous game
 reliyon, sabhaaon, yatraaon ke rup main 'tantra' khuleam yah khel kheltaa rahaa he
 In this race of power-performance, power, time and money are misused, along with life, people also feel inconvenienced by disrupting traffic and other systems
 yahi bheed ugr or hinsak hokar rashtriya-sampatti ko bhi kshati pahunchaati he
 Unpleasant incidents happen
 aaj jab shashan ko janata tak or janata ko shashan tak apni baat pahunchane ke liye doordarshan, samachar-patr, email, soshal-media jaise anek prabhaavshaalee sansaadhan uplabdh hai tab aise bheed bhare pradarshnon-sabhaaon kaa kya auchity he ? lokhit main rashtriya-sampatti kii suraksha ke liye 'lok' or 'tantra' donon ko bheed jutaney se bachane kii aavashyaktaa he
 The role of every citizen in democracy is that of a conscious watchdog
 'lok' kii jaagrukta se 'tantra' galat nirnay nahin le saktaa, vah apni manamaani nahin kar saktaa or jaagruk 'tantra' lok-kalyaan main baadhak aapraadhik tatwon ko nahin panpane detaa
 Thus the success of democracy depends on the awareness of both 'lok' and 'tantra'
 vidmbana yah he ki aaj ham apane samuhik swaarthon ke prati jaagrukta prakat karte hai, lokhit ke prati nahin
 If we renounce the divided mindset and become aware of the interests of the whole society by tying it into a single thread of national consciousness, forget mutual disharmony, renounce the bitterness of past events and pledge for mutual cooperation, our democracy will become more powerful and meaningful
 yah smaraneey he ki hamaare loktantr kii jeevanshkti vibhinn samoohon ke madhya samanvay main he, sangharsh main nahin

 Karnal Singh and his comrades became aware of their rights for the first time due to the efforts of the Land Acquisition Conflict Committee (ZPSC), a left wing organization working for land rights in Sangrur district, on June 27, 2014, to combat more than 500 police personnel Came out of their homes for sthaneey panchayat or rajasav adhikari anusuchit jatiyon ko lij par dene ke liye arakshit 121 acre jameen kii nilaamee ko radd karnaa chaahate the

 The ships have to wander in the sea for 15-20 days
 Haldia port of West Bengal has not one or two, but the entire 35 ships are standing
 bandargah kaa kinaaraa chhichhlaa ho chukaa he
 The work of deepening the edges by removing the sand of the sea is so dull that ships have to wander in the sea for 15-20 days to reach the port
 haldiya port ke adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki wo chaahakar bhi kuch nahin kar sakate, kyonki bandargah par jahaazon ke aane kaa rasta banane vaale drager naakaafi hai
 24 out of 35 ships are loaded with iron vessels currently stranded at Haldia Port, out of which 24 ships are loaded with iron, while crude oil on four ships, sugar on one ship, cement on one ship and chemical on one ship

 ab 10 million se bhi graahakon vaali badi vird sarvice prowider company BSNL kai rajyon main cabel TV operators ke saath saajhedaari kar rahi he
 BSNL already provides broadband and landline services to customers in many areas and now with the help of cable TV operators, the company will provide three services within a single bill
 telecomtok kii report ke mutabik, BSNL ne pehali khep main andhra-pradesh or telugana, karnataka or gujarat jaise kuch rajyon main cabel tivi sarvice prowiders ke saath saajhedaari kii he
 According to the information received, BSNL will help the cable TV operators to get a new box, which will provide all the three services like jiofiber's ONT box
 jaisaa ki upar bataaya gaya ki BSNL ke 10 million se bhi zyada vird broadband sabsakribers hai
 But the pace of customer engagement is a bit slow
 khaastaur par pichley do saalon main sthiti thodi zyada bigadi he
 It is being speculated that with the new jiofiber bundle plans, Jio can move ahead of BSNL in less than 6 months
 maujuuda samay main BSNL graahakon ko landline or broadband plance uplabdh kar rahaa he
 But in Geofiber, landline, broadband and cable TV services are being offered at an initial price of Rs 699
 haalanki jeeophiber graahakon ko live tivi dekhne ke liye alag se LCO conection lenaa hoga
 In such a situation, after partnering with cable TV operators, BSNL will be able to provide triple play services at almost the same price

 In a spectacular performance in the five state assembly elections, the Congress has broken Prime Minister Narendra Modi's dream of 'congress Mukt Bharat'
 party ne chhattisgarh main do-tihaai se adhik siten jitate hue prachand bahumat hasil kiya he
 At the same time, the party also got a clear majority in Rajasthan
 madhya pradesh main bhi congress sabase badi party banakar ubhari he
 It is clear that the Congress has come back in the Hindi states
 haalanki, congress ko telugana or mizoram main haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa he
 With this mandate, the Congress has emerged strong and this will give a strong boost to President Rahul Gandhi
 amethi se loksabhaa saansad rahul ke liye yah jeet isliye bhi ahm he kyonki unhone 2014 ke aam chunaavon se lekar kai rajyon main haar ke baad ab sidhe mukaable main piem modi or amit shah ko patkhni di he
 This victory will not only strengthen Rahul Gandhi's Iqbal within the Congress but it will also be difficult to stop him from becoming the axis of the Grand Alliance
 bayanon se bhi milane lage sanketajediu ke purv adhyaksh sharad yadav ne rahul gandhi ke samarthan main sabase pehle khulkar bayaan diya he
 He said, 'rahul Gandhi is the leader of the largest party of the opposition
 ' mahagathbandhan ko lekar bhi sharad ne kaha, 'mahagathbandhan kai maheenon se kaam kar rahaa he
 In the name of shared heritage, conferences have taken place in many places and will work forward
 'vidhansabha chunaavake nattejey abhi puri tarah se saamne bhi nahin aae the ki tabhi samaajawaadee party ke supremeo akhilesh yadav ne twit kiya- 'jab ek or ek milakar banate hai gyaarah 
 
 
 Then the power of the elders becomes nine and eleven
 
 
 ' is twit se spasht he ki akhilesh bijepi virdohi partiyon ke ek saath aane kii himaayat kar rahe hai
 Senior party leader Ram Gopal Yadav has also said that his party will unconditionally support the Congress if needed in Madhya Pradesh
 is bich, bispi supremeo mayawati ne buudhvaar kii subah press conference kar madhya pradesh main congress ke samarthan kaa elaan kiya he
 Earlier, it was important that the issue is important because from time to time, the parties opposing the BJP, like the Trinamool Congress, SP, BSP, sometimes clearly, sometimes in gestures, question the opposition parties united under Rahul Gandhi
 Have been standing
 mamata ne bhi naam tay karne kaa kiya tha virohisi saal july main media se baatcheet karte huemamta banerjeene rahul gandhi ke netritv main aglaa chunaav ladane ko lekar kaha tha- 'agle loksabhaa chunaav ke liye ban rahe mahagathbandhan main pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar kaa naam philhal tay nahin kiya janaa chahie
 If this happens, it will affect the unity of regional parties
 bijepi ke khilaaf sabhi kshetreey partiyon ko ek saath aana chahie or desh ke hit main qurbaani deni chahie
 We have to fight for the people
 2019 main ham logon kii, logon ke dwaara or logon ke liye sarkaar banaaenge
 'akhilesh had told Mulayam, pm's contender this year, Akhilesh Yadav had given a statement-' Netaji Mulayam Singh Yadav can also be a contender for the post of PM
 netaji kisaanon ke netaa hai or kisaanon ke vikaas ke bina desh kaa vikaas nahin ho saktaa?' congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ke pradhanmantri banane ke sawaal par unhone kaha tha ki yah samay tay karegaa
 Party spokesperson Sunil Singh said in July this year, "rahul Gandhi or someone else will be the face of the alliance, how can this Congress decide?" Who will be the pm's face, all the parties will decide together
 ''aap' ne bhi kiya tha virondilli ke siem arvind kejariwal ne bhi paanch rajyon ke vidhansabha chunaavon se pehle kaha tha ki bijepi ko haraana he to congress ko vot na karen
 Mayawati had also aligned against the Congress, Mayawati has also never openly accepted Rahul Gandhi's leadership
 unhone chhattisgarh main congress se haath nahin milaayaa tha or ajit jogi kii party se gathbandhan kar liya tha
 During the assembly election campaign in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, BSP supremo Mayawati attacked the BJP as well as the Congress
 unhone tel ke bade daam par bijepi ke saath congress par bhi nishaanaa saadhaa tha
 He had said that the wrong economic policies of the Congress-led UPA government were pushed forward by the Modi government, due to which the prices of petrol and diesel have increased drastically today
 matlab saaf he ki nattejey aane se pehle rahul gandhi ke netritv yaa 2019 main piem pad ke liye unki daavedaari ke samarthan main bijepi virdohi partiyaan saaf bayaan nahin de rahi thim
 
 
 
 lekin ab aage najar aa rahe rahulalekin rajasthan, chhattisgarh or madhya pradesh main congress kii jeet ke baad halaat teji se badal rahe hai
 Now the grand alliance under the leadership of Congress can take shape more clearly
 or isaki aguwai karne main rahul gandhi sabase aage khadey najar aa rahe hai
 Rahul will be the axis of anti-bjp parties! Apart from BJP in the country, Congress is the only party whose workers are in all states of India
 is morche par congress hi bijepi ke mukaable khadi najar aati he
 His presence is universal
 congress ke alaava vipaksh kii kisi bhi party kii maujuudagi puure desh main nahin he
 This situation was also there earlier
 lekin bijepi ke haathon congress ko lagaataar milti haar kii vajah se bijepi virdohi partiyaan rahul gandhi ke netritv main khadi nahin hona chaahati thim
 At the same time, due to the defeat in most states, the Congress was also not able to openly pressurize that the allied parties should accept Rahul Gandhi's leadership in the alliance
 lekin ab is baat ke puure asaar hai ki teen rajyon main mili jeet ke baad rahul gandhi kii ore se mahagathbandhan kaa netritv karne or 2019 main unki piem pad kii daavedaari ko lekar congress zyada mukhar hogi

 In their last match, Chennai registered a big win over the Dolphins

 During this time he also completed five thousand runs in T20 cricket
 lahore ke kilaaf ek chakka jadte hi raina pehle bhartiya ballebaaz honge jinke naam tii-20 main 200 chakke ho jaaenge
 Before Raina, 10 foreign batsmen have done this feat

 in par smart city ke bare main concept note mila
 Although it is easy to take oath of ministerial post or Member of Parliament in Hindi and Sanskrit, but when you start writing a concept note on Smart City, you will get it in English first
 angreji main hi mila
 The Consulate Note uploaded in November 2014 has said some things in many ways, which we call filling the page in college
 jaise 2050 tak shahari aabaadi dugani ho jaaegi
 At present, the urban population in India is only 31 percent but its contribution to the GDP is 60 percent
 magar ise 'etna etna' saal ke baad badhaakar 75 pratishat hona he
 Therefore cities need to be made smart
 shahar aarthik vikaas ke eenjan hai
 It states that the smart city will have better infrastructure, better water cleaning services, transparent process, investment will come in and approvals for commercial activities will be made easier
 soochna technology ke istemaal se smart city kii kushalta ko badhaayaa jayega
 There will be favorable environment for employment and economic activities
 google karenge to thik isi bhashaa main kai agenciyon ke lekh smart city kii vakaalat karte mil jaaenge
 The concept paper has a question what is a smart city
 iskaa jawaab suniye, shahar main alag-alag logon ke liye smartnes kaa matlab alag hota he
 It can be smart design, smart housing, smart mobility, smart technology, etc
 smart city kii paribhaasha dena mushkil he
 If the definition is difficult, can we tell what is the difference between design and smart design? smart city kii khoobiyon ko technology se bataaya ja saktaa he
 The government is presenting it as a model of employment, economic development and a better life
 44 pej ke concept note main ek para ye mila ki yah bhi zaruri he ki shahar samaveshi hon or aise dhaanche bane jisamen anusuchit jati / janajati, saamaajik or aarthik rup se pichde, alpsankhyak, auraton ko vikaas kii mukhyadhara main laayaa ja sake
 According to the concept note of the Smart City, the state capital will also be made smart
 das se chalis lakh ke 35 shahar bhi smart banenge
 25 cities of one to two lakhs will be settled
 ek se do lakh ke shahar to privet builder basaate hi rahete hai to kya ve aarthik gatividhi nahin badha rahe hai
 Now i have a question
 maine jitne bhi lekh padhe unamem bharat ke maujuuda shaharon ko ausat bataaya gaya he
 But when read again and again in the same articles that 31 per cent of India's population is urban and the contribution of cities to GDP is 60 per cent, then the question arises that if the contribution of cities in this average condition is so much, are they not smart
 agar hamaare shahar aarthik rup se itane bekaar hai to 60 pratishat tak kaise pahunch sake hai
 The curiosity of the smart city should be tempered by both question and possibility
 isamen koi shaq nahin ki nae shaharon kii zarurat he lekin kya smart city ke daawey par bharosa kiya ja saktaa he ki isse bijness badhegaa
 Building a city will increase business or increase industry
 kya smart city ke bahaane construction udyog ko badhaava dena jo banate vakt to jidipi main gina jayega magar banane ke baad china ke kai shaharon kii tarah bhutaha ho jayega
 The comments gift jaise finance city kii baat to samaj aati he lekin ek desh main aap aise kitne shahar bana sakate hai
 If the communication technology can be used to make smart city better and less expensive, then why can't the same technology be brought to the old cities to improve the standard of living there
 kya smart city nayaa sez(sez) he
 It has been claimed that the approval process will be made easier for the business, so why should the businessmen of Delhi's Sadar Bazar, Mumbai's Jhaveri Bazar and Kolkata's Bazar Bazaar not get it
 maujuuda majhole shaharon ko smart city main badalane kii baat he lekin kya vaaki hamen 100 smart city kii zarurat he
 Satellite cities like Gurgaon, Noida, Navi Mumbai are also facing challenges
 kai project launch hote rahete hai magar unka haal sab jaanate hai
 The bulk of the land taken for SEZ is lying idle
 duniya bhar main smart city ko ek bijness idia ke rup main prachaarit kiya ja rahaa he

 i am telling you all this so that you can understand that this is now a new business and a reality
 abhi tak raajaaon ne basaaya, sarkaron ne basaaya, logon ne atikaraman kar shahar basaaye, ab companiyaan shahar basaayengi
 But when you see his company's bus running back and forth under police protection, are you really worried that the prices of petrol and diesel are going up again by three rupees and four rupees per liter
 kya punjab sarkaar ke liye petrol mahangaa nahin hua he ki ek privet company kii gaadi ko police kii do-do gaadiyaan escort kar rahi hai
 Does the state government give such protection to any private company bus or will the bus of Badal family company be given such protection? Will so much protection be given to the mother who is struggling in the hospital and one of her daughters is killed? Are there two buses of Mercedes on a bus, two buses of Mercedes? You decide whether it is smartness or not
 agra ke fatehpur sikari kii is ghatana se aapako khud ke smart hone par shame aegi

 Concept note about smart city found in
 vaise hindi or sanskrit main mantri pad yaa saansad kii sadsyta kii shapath lenaa aasaan he lekin jab aap smart city par concept note likhane chalenge to pehle angrezi main hi milegaa
 Found in English only
 nanvabar 2014 main aplod kiye gaye conspet note main kuch baton ko kai baar ghumafirakar kaha gaya he, jise ham college main panna bharna kehete hai
 For example, by 2050, the urban population will double
 abhi bharat main shahari aabaadi 31 pratishat hi he lekin jidipi main uskaa yogadan 60 pratishat he
 But it has to be increased to 75 percent after the year 'etna Etna'
 isliye shaharon ko smart banane kii zarurat he
 Cities are engines of economic development
 isamen bataaya gaya he ki smart city main badhiya infrastracchar hoga, pani safai kii behatar sevaayen hongi, paardarshee prakriya hogi, nivesh aayega or vanijyik gatividhiyon ke liye manzuri kii prakiya aasaan kii jaaegi taaki aasaan ho sake
 The use of information technology will enhance the efficiency of the smart city
 rojgaar or aarthik gatividhiyon ke liye anukool maahaul banegaa
 If Google does, articles of many agencies will be found advocating smart city in the same language
 concept paper main ek prashn he smart city kya he
 Hear the answer, smartness means different to different people in the city
 yah smart dizine ho saktaa he, smart houseing ho sakati he, smart mobility ho sakati he, smart technology ityadi ho sakati he
 It is difficult to define a smart city
 agar paribhaasha mushkil he to kya yah bataaya ja saktaa he ki dizine or smart dizine main kya antar he
 The merits of smart city can be explained through technology
 sarkaar ise rojgaar, aarthik vikaas or behatar jivan ke model ke rup main pesh kar rahi he
 a paragraph in the 44-page concept note found that it is also important that cities be inclusive and have a framework in which the Scheduled Castes / Tribes, socially and economically backward, minorities, women can be brought into the mainstream of development
 smart city ke concept note ke anusaar rajyon kii rajdhani ko bhi smart banaaya jayega
 35 cities of ten to four million will also become smart
 ek se do lakh ke 25 shahar basaae jaaenge
 If one to two lakh cities continue to settle in private builders, are they not increasing economic activity? ab meraa ek sawaal he
 In all the articles i have read, the present cities of India have been described as average
 lekin unheen lekhon main jab baar-baar ye padhaa ki bharat kii 31 fisadi aabaadi shahari he or jidipi main shaharon kaa yogadan 60 pratishat he to sawaal uthaa ki is ausat haalat main agar shaharon kaa yogadan itnaa he to kya ve smart nahin hai
 If our cities are so useless financially, how can we reach 60 percent? smart city kii jigyaasa ko sawaal or sambhaavna donon se shant kiya janaa chahie
 There is no doubt that new cities are needed, but can the smart city claim that it will increase business? shahar banane se bijness badhegaa yaa udyog badhaane se
 Will the construction industry be promoted on the pretext of smart city, which will be counted in the GDP at the time of construction, but will become haunted like many cities of China after it is built
 tippaniyan It is understandable about a finance city like a gift, but how many such cities can you build in a country
 jis communication technology kaa istemaal smart city ko behatar or kam kharche vaala banane main kiya ja saktaa he to vahi technology puraane shaharon main kyon nahin laai ja sakati jisase vahaan kaa jivan str behatar ho sake
 Is Smart City the new SEZ (SEZ)
 daawa kiya gaya he ki bijness ke liye manzuri kii prakriya aasaan kii jaaegi to yahi chhot dilli ke sadar bazaar, mumbai ke jhaveri bazaar or kolkata ke bada bazaar ke kaarobaariyon ko kyon na mili
 There is talk of converting existing medium cities into smart cities, but do we really need 100 smart cities
 gudgaanv, noida, navi mumbai jaise setailite shahar bhi chunautiyon se guzar rahe hai
 Many projects are launched, but their condition is well known

 kya kisi bhi privet company kii bas ko rajya sarkaar aisi suraksha detii he yaa badal parivaar kii company kii bas ko aisi suraksha di jaaegi? kya itani suraksha us maa ko di jaaegi jo aspataal main sangharsh kar rahi he or uski ek beti kii jaan ja chuki he? marcidij kii basen hai to kya ek bas par do do police kii gaadi? ye aap tay kiijie ki ye smartnes he yaa nahin

 in par smart city ke bare main concept note mila
 Although it is easy to take oath of ministerial post or Member of Parliament in Hindi and Sanskrit, but when you start writing a concept note on Smart City, you will get it in English first
 angreji main hi mila
 The Consulate Note uploaded in November 2014 has said some things in many ways, which we call filling the page in college
 jaise 2050 tak shahari aabaadi dugani ho jaaegi
 At present, the urban population in India is only 31 percent but its contribution to the GDP is 60 percent
 magar ise 'etna etna' saal ke baad badhaakar 75 pratishat hona he
 Therefore cities need to be made smart
 shahar aarthik vikaas ke eenjan hai
 It states that the smart city will have better infrastructure, better water cleaning services, transparent process, investment will come in and approvals for commercial activities will be made easier
 soochna technology ke istemaal se smart city kii kushalta ko badhaayaa jayega
 There will be favorable environment for employment and economic activities
 google karenge to thik isi bhashaa main kai agenciyon ke lekh smart city kii vakaalat karte mil jaaenge
 The concept paper has a question what is a smart city
 iskaa jawaab suniye, shahar main alag-alag logon ke liye smartnes kaa matlab alag hota he
 It can be smart design, smart housing, smart mobility, smart technology, etc
 smart city kii paribhaasha dena mushkil he
 If the definition is difficult, can we tell what is the difference between design and smart design? smart city kii khoobiyon ko technology se bataaya ja saktaa he
 The government is presenting it as a model of employment, economic development and a better life
 44 pej ke concept note main ek para ye mila ki yah bhi zaruri he ki shahar samaveshi hon or aise dhaanche bane jisamen anusuchit jati / janajati, saamaajik or aarthik rup se pichde, alpsankhyak, auraton ko vikaas kii mukhyadhara main laayaa ja sake
 According to the concept note of the Smart City, the state capital will also be made smart
 das se chalis lakh ke 35 shahar bhi smart banenge
 25 cities of one to two lakhs will be settled
 ek se do lakh ke shahar to privet builder basaate hi rahete hai to kya ve aarthik gatividhi nahin badha rahe hai
 Now i have a question
 maine jitne bhi lekh padhe unamem bharat ke maujuuda shaharon ko ausat bataaya gaya he
 But when read again and again in the same articles that 31 per cent of India's population is urban and the contribution of cities to GDP is 60 per cent, then the question arises that if the contribution of cities in this average condition is so much, are they not smart
 agar hamaare shahar aarthik rup se itane bekaar hai to 60 pratishat tak kaise pahunch sake hai
 The curiosity of the smart city should be tempered by both question and possibility
 isamen koi shaq nahin ki nae shaharon kii zarurat he lekin kya smart city ke daawey par bharosa kiya ja saktaa he ki isse bijness badhegaa
 Building a city will increase business or increase industry
 kya smart city ke bahaane construction udyog ko badhaava dena jo banate vakt to jidipi main gina jayega magar banane ke baad china ke kai shaharon kii tarah bhutaha ho jayega
 The comments gift jaise finance city kii baat to samaj aati he lekin ek desh main aap aise kitne shahar bana sakate hai
 If the communication technology can be used to make smart city better and less expensive, then why can't the same technology be brought to the old cities to improve the standard of living there
 kya smart city nayaa sez(sez) he
 It has been claimed that the approval process will be made easier for the business, so why should the businessmen of Delhi's Sadar Bazar, Mumbai's Jhaveri Bazar and Kolkata's Bazar Bazaar not get it
 maujuuda majhole shaharon ko smart city main badalane kii baat he lekin kya vaaki hamen 100 smart city kii zarurat he
 Satellite cities like Gurgaon, Noida, Navi Mumbai are also facing challenges
 kai project launch hote rahete hai magar unka haal sab jaanate hai
 The bulk of the land taken for SEZ is lying idle
 duniya bhar main smart city ko ek bijness idia ke rup main prachaarit kiya ja rahaa he

 Concept note about smart city found in
 vaise hindi or sanskrit main mantri pad yaa saansad kii sadsyta kii shapath lenaa aasaan he lekin jab aap smart city par concept note likhane chalenge to pehle angrezi main hi milegaa
 Found in English only
 nanvabar 2014 main aplod kiye gaye conspet note main kuch baton ko kai baar ghumafirakar kaha gaya he, jise ham college main panna bharna kehete hai
 For example, by 2050, the urban population will double
 abhi bharat main shahari aabaadi 31 pratishat hi he lekin jidipi main uskaa yogadan 60 pratishat he
 But it has to be increased to 75 percent after the year 'etna Etna'
 isliye shaharon ko smart banane kii zarurat he
 Cities are engines of economic development
 isamen bataaya gaya he ki smart city main badhiya infrastracchar hoga, pani safai kii behatar sevaayen hongi, paardarshee prakriya hogi, nivesh aayega or vanijyik gatividhiyon ke liye manzuri kii prakiya aasaan kii jaaegi taaki aasaan ho sake
 The use of information technology will enhance the efficiency of the smart city
 rojgaar or aarthik gatividhiyon ke liye anukool maahaul banegaa
 If Google does, articles of many agencies will be found advocating smart city in the same language
 concept paper main ek prashn he smart city kya he
 Hear the answer, smartness means different to different people in the city
 yah smart dizine ho saktaa he, smart houseing ho sakati he, smart mobility ho sakati he, smart technology ityadi ho sakati he
 It is difficult to define a smart city
 agar paribhaasha mushkil he to kya yah bataaya ja saktaa he ki dizine or smart dizine main kya antar he
 The merits of smart city can be explained through technology
 sarkaar ise rojgaar, aarthik vikaas or behatar jivan ke model ke rup main pesh kar rahi he
 a paragraph in the 44-page concept note found that it is also important that cities be inclusive and have a framework in which the Scheduled Castes / Tribes, socially and economically backward, minorities, women can be brought into the mainstream of development
 smart city ke concept note ke anusaar rajyon kii rajdhani ko bhi smart banaaya jayega
 35 cities of ten to four million will also become smart
 ek se do lakh ke 25 shahar basaae jaaenge
 If one to two lakh cities continue to settle in private builders, are they not increasing economic activity? ab meraa ek sawaal he
 In all the articles i have read, the present cities of India have been described as average

 If our cities are so useless financially, how can we reach 60 percent? smart city kii jigyaasa ko sawaal or sambhaavna donon se shant kiya janaa chahie
 There is no doubt that new cities are needed, but can the smart city claim that it will increase business? shahar banane se bijness badhegaa yaa udyog badhaane se
 Will the construction industry be promoted on the pretext of smart city, which will be counted in the GDP at the time of construction, but will become haunted like many cities of China after it is built
 tippaniyan It is understandable about a finance city like a gift, but how many such cities can you build in a country
 jis communication technology kaa istemaal smart city ko behatar or kam kharche vaala banane main kiya ja saktaa he to vahi technology puraane shaharon main kyon nahin laai ja sakati jisase vahaan kaa jivan str behatar ho sake

 Since the terrorist attack in Pulwama, Jammu and Kashmir on 14 February, india-pakistan relations have seen a period of ups and downs
 donon deshon ne ek-duusare kii vayusima main jaakar strike karne kaa daawa kiya
 In this expedition, the Indian Air Force wing commander Abhinandan Vardhaman reached the Pakistani border with the mig-21 in the course of killing Pakistan's F-16
 is ghatana ke baad pakistani pradhanmantri ne video sandesh jari kar kaha ki bhartiya payalat pakistan main he or iske ek din baad unhone apni sansad main kaha ki ve bhartiya payalat ko reeha karenge
 In the meantime, he offered to settle the matter through an interaction with India in two video messages and investigate the Pulwama incident
 bharat ne aatankwaad ke khilaaf sakht rukh apanaate hue kaha ki pehle ection lo, phir baat hogi
 However, during this time people from both countries were seen fighting against each other on Twitter
 soshal netwarking site twitor par logon ne ek-duusare kii senaaon or netaaon par or aapas main bhi khub laanat-malaanat kii
 During this period, many people trended the # indiastrikesback hashtag in support of the Indian Air Force's attack on Balakote on 26 February following the Pulwama terror attack
 bharat kaa kahana he ki usne balakot main jaish-e-mohammad ke thikaane par hawaii hamalaa kar aatankiyon ko maut ke ghat utaar diya he
 However, Pakistan has denied this claim
 iske baad 27 farvari ko pakistan ke teen F-16 bina soochna die bhartiya vayusima main ghus aae or yahaan par missile bhi giraayi
 When he was warned by the Indian Air Force to return, Wing Commander Abhinandan rode in the mig-21 and chased him and heaped an F-16
 lekin is dauraan abhinandan kaa plane bhi krash ho gaya or vah pakistani seemaa main land hue
 People took to Twitter to trend # pakistanstrikesback in support of this Pakistan strike
 jab ye donon hashtag twitor par trend kar rahe the, usee dauraan donon deshon ke kuch log ek or hashtag ko twitor par trend kara rahe the
 This hashtag of # saynotowar was appealing to the rulers and people of both countries for peace
 haalanki, kuch logon ko shanti kii baat bilkul raas nahin aa rahi thi or ve iske khilaaf # sayyestowar hashtag ko trend kara rahe the
 Amidst all this, the Wing Commander Abhinandan was handed over to India by nine and a half hours on the night of March 1, and the impact of the war environment that had been going on for the last three-four days had diminished for some time
 pakistani sena ke adhikariyon ke bich garv se sir ooncha kiye wagha-ataari border par chalate hue wing commander abhinandan ko dekh donon deshon ke bich yudhviram chaahane waalon ko isamen dosti kii jhalak dikhaai de rahi thi to yuddh chaahane waalon ko apni jeet or haar dikhaai de rahi thi
 Now the question is which of these four hashtags was most frequently tweeted on Twitter during these four days of the war frenzy, ie which of these campaigns won
 twitor ke aankadon ke mutabik, inamen sabase kam twit # sayyestowar ko kiya gaya
 78,600 people tweeted it
 iske baad number aata he # pakistanstrikesback hashtag kaa
 It was tweeted 2,91,000 times
 vahiin, # indiastrikesback hashtag ko 6,25,000 baar twit kiya gaya
 It should be noted here that both India has a higher population and literacy rate than Pakistan, so # indiastrikesback has been tweeted by far more people than # pakistanstrikesback
 haalanki, in sab hashtag main sabase zyada twit # saynotowar ko kiya gaya
 It was tweeted by 6,27,000 people
 yani donon deshon ke bich yuddh ko chaahane waalon logon ke mukaable shanti kii baat karne waalon kii sankhya zyada thi
 (photo credit- Hamza Aamir) This peace may have been advocated in the virtual world, but another beautiful sight was seen when Abhinandan was in Pakistan

 anna andolan kaa saal tha
 In view of this, Anna and Anna supporters came in Gandhi cap
 gandhi topi ko 'anna topi' kaha jane laga
 When Anna's supporters split, the cap was also divided
 achaanak raajnneeti main tarah tarah ke naaron se likhin tapiyaan nazar aane lageen
 Gandhi's simple hat became a billboard, that is, he became more a symbol of his party and his slogan than ideology
 gandhi kii topi british hukumat ke kilaaf pratirodh kaa pratik thi
 Nehru appeared in the Gandhi cap, but gradually the Gandhi cap disappeared from the heads of the Congress leaders
 bachi rah gai to seva dal ke kaaryakartaaon ke sar par
 When Anna Hazare came to the scene in 2011, he had a hat, but Gandhi was called but because he used to say, 'I am Anna Hazare, i want Lokpal'
 2012 main anna se arvind kejariwal alag hue to topi bhi saath-saath nikali magar ab us topi par likhaa hota tha 'mujhe chahie swaraj' or 'main hum aam aadmi'
 Later, the slogan 'five years Kejriwal' was also written on the cap
 baaki dalon ne bhi apane dal ke rang kii topi pahan lee
 BJP supporters put 'modi for PM' on their caps
 topi ko lekar aisi hode bhartiya raajnneeti main kabhi nahin dekhi gai
 By the time the Congress leaders discovered their hats, the franchise of the Gandhi Topi brand was distributed among all parties
 jis vakt safed topi thi usee daur main aresas ne apni topi ke liye pehle khaaki phir kaala rang chunaa
 Meanwhile, the clothes of the Sangh also changed several times, but in the meeting of the House of Representatives in Nagaur, the Sangh decided that from now on, half-pants would not be worn
 mausam ke hisaab to ye faisla sardi main hona chahie tha, magar garmi main bhi log phul pant to pahante hi hai
 Now volunteers will wear brown trousers instead of khaki
 rajasthan ke nagaur main sangh ke general secetry bhaiyya joshi ne kaha ki saamaanya jivan main phulpant chalati he
 There is nothing specific about why we have accepted it
 bhaiyyaji badlaav ke kaarnon ke bare main vistaar se bataate to thik se charchaa hoti
 Normally, the swayamsevaks of the Sangh also wear dhoti kurta, kurta pajama and pant shirt, but the branch will now be seen in full pants
 pataa chalata ki beong or bedaul fitting ke kaaran half pant kii vidaai hui yaa vaaki half pant silne vaala koi acha tailor nahin mila
 Half pants are also no less popular if you keep track of the world of fashion
 bade-bade brands tarah tarah kii fitting vaale half pant bechate hai
 Wasn't the Sangh's branches expanding because of half pants? media main pichley do saal se to yahi chap rahaa he ki shakhaon kii sankhya badhati ja rahi he
 In the meeting of All India House of Representatives held in Nagaur, Joint General Secretary of the Union Krishnagopal has presented a report that in the last one year, 5524 branches have been connected in daily branches
 yani subah kii shakhaon kii sankhya 51,335 se badhkar 56,859 ho gai he
 The 'hindu' newspaper has published this in its report
 pitiai ne pichley saal november main ek report prakashit kii thi
 According to this report 10,000 branches have grown in ten years
 pitiai ne vidarbha ke joint secetry deepak tamshettiver ke hawaale se likhaa he ki november, 2014 se november, 2015 ke bich 6684 shakhaaen badi hai
 The Sangh should also make an app and provide the details of all the branches so that volunteers can connect with each other's branches
 sochiye bhaajapa sarkaar baat-baat main ap banavaa detii he lekin sangh kyon ap nahin banavaata
 If such an app is created then we will not have to depend on Rakesh Sinha for everything
 hamaari janata ko is baat se fark nahin padataa ki koun kya pahentaa he
 Just the price should not be known
 ghadi, suut or shawl kii keemat kaa pataa lagate hi raajnneeti hone lagati he
 Now come to the thought
 kabhi samiksha to kabhi krimi layer ke naam par sangh hawa kaa rukh bhaanp rahaa he yaa aane vaale samay kii taiyaari kar rahaa he
 On Sunday, Bhaiyyaji Joshi was asked what is the opinion about Jat and Patidar reservation movement, then his reply was that it is a matter of concern
 jab doctor baba sahab ambedkar ne aarakshan kaa prastaav kiya tha, tab unhone saamaajik sthiti or saamaajik nyaay ke sandarbh main kaha tha
 The people belonging to the scheduled castes and tribes were left behind due to many reasons, so we consider reservation for them right
 aarakshan kii vajah se ek bade varg ko phayda hi hua he
 There should be a demand for reservation in the context of this sentiment
 jab sampann log aarakshan kii maang karte hai to yah sahi soch nahin he
 Those who are rich should give up some of their rights
 kya sampann se unka sirf matlab jat or patidaar andolan he yaa wo sampann ke bahaane aarakshan ke daayre main aane vaali jatiyon ke sampann tabake kii ore bhi ishaara kar rahe hai
 There is also consistency and a variety of instability in the Sangh statements
 bhaiyya ji joshi se jab krimi layer ke bare main poocha gaya to jawaab diya, hamen yah sochna hoga ki kya aarakshan kaa phayda un logon tak pahunch rahaa he jinhen isaki zarurat he
 There is a need to read the issue of creamy layer and attend church 
 abhi coment karnaa sahi nahin hoga
 What is meant by the needy is not getting the benefit of reservation
 kya siten khaali rah ja rahi hai to bhaiyya ji joshi jaldi bharne kii baat kar rahe hai
 The creamy layer is only for obcs
 chah lakh se zyada kamaane vaale krimi layer maane jate hai or unhen aarakshan nahin miltaa he
 When the affluent is not getting reservation, then what does Bhaiyyaji Joshi mean by affluent
 kya sangh yah maanata he ki jat or patidaar sampann hai or aarakshan ke hakdaar nahin he
 So why did the Haryana Chief Minister not expressly refuse unki sarkaar to jat aarakshan par vichaar karne kaa vaada kar chuki he
 While the BJP government in Gujarat has refused the Patidar reservation
 3 november, 2015 ko ranchi main bhaiyya ji joshi ne hi kaha tha ki aarakshan tab tak rahanaa chahie jab tak samaaj ko isaki zarurat he
 This is our stand

 25 oktober, 2015 ke 'dainik bhaskar' main chapa he ki mohan bhagwat ne kaha ki aarakshan sangh kaa vishay nahin he
 We do not study in terms of reservation
 phir bhaiyya ji joshi ko kyon kahana padaa ki kya aarakshan kaa phayda zaruuratmand tak pahunchaa, krimi layer par charchaa karne kii zarurat he
 What do you mean by affluent people? professor sukhdev thoraat or nitin tagade ne economik and polytical vikali main chape lekh main pesh kiya he
 Based on the employment data of the 2012 National Sample Survey, it has been reported that in 2012, the number of regular salaries in the non-agricultural sector was 8
 56 karod thi
 Out of these, 6 crore jobs belong to the private sector which are outside the purview of reservation
 ab batch gayi 2
 56 crore jobs, 40 percent of which are temporary jobs
 asthaayee naukariyon main aarakshan lagu nahin hota he
 Accordingly, the number of permanent jobs in the non-agricultural sector becomes 1
 54 karod
 Ie 8
 56 karod sthaayee naukariyon ke maatr 18 fisadi main hi aarakshan lagu hua
 Of these, the share of the permanent employees of Scheduled Castes 18
 5 pratishat hi tha
 Arun Jaitley immediately clarified the government's opinion on Bhaiyya Joshi's statement
 aarakshan kii jo vyavastha chal rahi he usamen koi badlaav nahin hone vaala he
 BJP has given this explanation without delay
 bijepi kya yahi baat jat samudaay se bhi kah rahi he
 He promised to provide reservation to weaker sections on economic grounds
 kya us par bhi party kii raay badal gai he
 From the BSP to the Congress, there is talk of reservation of poor sections on economic basis
 kya hua
 Gandhi's simple hat became a billboard, that is, he became more a symbol of his party and his slogan than ideology
 gandhi kii topi british hukumat ke kilaaf pratirodh kaa pratik thi
 Nehru appeared in the Gandhi cap, but gradually the Gandhi cap disappeared from the heads of the Congress leaders
 bachi rah gai to seva dal ke kaaryakartaaon ke sar par
 When Anna Hazare came to the scene in 2011, he had a hat, but Gandhi was called but because he used to say, 'I am Anna Hazare, i want Lokpal'
 2012 main anna se arvind kejariwal alag hue to topi bhi saath-saath nikali magar ab us topi par likhaa hota tha 'mujhe chahie swaraj' or 'main hum aam aadmi'
 Later, the slogan 'five years Kejriwal' was also written on the cap
 baaki dalon ne bhi apane dal ke rang kii topi pahan lee
 BJP supporters put 'modi for PM' on their caps
 topi ko lekar aisi hode bhartiya raajnneeti main kabhi nahin dekhi gai
 By the time the Congress leaders discovered their hats, the franchise of the Gandhi Topi brand was distributed among all parties
 jis vakt safed topi thi usee daur main aresas ne apni topi ke liye pehle khaaki phir kaala rang chunaa
 Meanwhile, the clothes of the Sangh also changed several times, but in the meeting of the House of Representatives in Nagaur, the Sangh decided that from now on, half-pants would not be worn
 mausam ke hisaab to ye faisla sardi main hona chahie tha, magar garmi main bhi log phul pant to pahante hi hai
 Now volunteers will wear brown trousers instead of khaki
 rajasthan ke nagaur main sangh ke general secetry bhaiyya joshi ne kaha ki saamaanya jivan main phulpant chalati he
 There is nothing specific about why we have accepted it
 bhaiyyaji badlaav ke kaarnon ke bare main vistaar se bataate to thik se charchaa hoti
 Normally, the swayamsevaks of the Sangh also wear dhoti kurta, kurta pajama and pant shirt, but the branch will now be seen in full pants
 pataa chalata ki beong or bedaul fitting ke kaaran half pant kii vidaai hui yaa vaaki half pant silne vaala koi acha tailor nahin mila
 Half pants are also no less popular if you keep track of the world of fashion
 bade-bade brands tarah tarah kii fitting vaale half pant bechate hai
 Wasn't the Sangh's branches expanding because of half pants? media main pichley do saal se to yahi chap rahaa he ki shakhaon kii sankhya badhati ja rahi he
 In the meeting of All India House of Representatives held in Nagaur, Joint General Secretary of the Union Krishnagopal has presented a report that in the last one year, 5524 branches have been connected in daily branches
 yani subah kii shakhaon kii sankhya 51,335 se badhkar 56,859 ho gai he
 The 'hindu' newspaper has published this in its report
 pitiai ne pichley saal november main ek report prakashit kii thi
 According to this report 10,000 branches have grown in ten years
 pitiai ne vidarbha ke joint secetry deepak tamshettiver ke hawaale se likhaa he ki november, 2014 se november, 2015 ke bich 6684 shakhaaen badi hai
 The Sangh should also make an app and provide the details of all the branches so that volunteers can connect with each other's branches
 sochiye bhaajapa sarkaar baat-baat main ap banavaa detii he lekin sangh kyon ap nahin banavaata
 If such an app is created then we will not have to depend on Rakesh Sinha for everything
 hamaari janata ko is baat se fark nahin padataa ki koun kya pahentaa he
 Just the price should not be known
 ghadi, suut or shawl kii keemat kaa pataa lagate hi raajnneeti hone lagati he
 Now come to the thought
 kabhi samiksha to kabhi krimi layer ke naam par sangh hawa kaa rukh bhaanp rahaa he yaa aane vaale samay kii taiyaari kar rahaa he
 On Sunday, Bhaiyyaji Joshi was asked what is the opinion about Jat and Patidar reservation movement, then his reply was that it is a matter of concern
 jab doctor baba sahab ambedkar ne aarakshan kaa prastaav kiya tha, tab unhone saamaajik sthiti or saamaajik nyaay ke sandarbh main kaha tha
 The people belonging to the scheduled castes and tribes were left behind due to many reasons, so we consider reservation for them right
 aarakshan kii vajah se ek bade varg ko phayda hi hua he
 There should be a demand for reservation in the context of this sentiment
 jab sampann log aarakshan kii maang karte hai to yah sahi soch nahin he
 Those who are rich should give up some of their rights
 kya sampann se unka sirf matlab jat or patidaar andolan he yaa wo sampann ke bahaane aarakshan ke daayre main aane vaali jatiyon ke sampann tabake kii ore bhi ishaara kar rahe hai
 There is also consistency and a variety of instability in the Sangh statements
 bhaiyya ji joshi se jab krimi layer ke bare main poocha gaya to jawaab diya, hamen yah sochna hoga ki kya aarakshan kaa phayda un logon tak pahunch rahaa he jinhen isaki zarurat he
 The issue of creamy layer needs to be read and discussed
 abhi coment karnaa sahi nahin hoga
 What is meant by the needy is not getting the benefit of reservation
 kya siten khaali rah ja rahi hai to bhaiyya ji joshi jaldi bharne kii baat kar rahe hai
 The creamy layer is only for obcs
 chah lakh se zyada kamaane vaale krimi layer maane jate hai or unhen aarakshan nahin miltaa he
 When the affluent is not getting reservation, then what does Bhaiyyaji Joshi mean by affluent
 kya sangh yah maanata he ki jat or patidaar sampann hai or aarakshan ke hakdaar nahin he
 So why did the Haryana Chief Minister not expressly refuse unki sarkaar to jat aarakshan par vichaar karne kaa vaada kar chuki he
 While the BJP government in Gujarat has refused the Patidar reservation
 3 november, 2015 ko ranchi main bhaiyya ji joshi ne hi kaha tha ki aarakshan tab tak rahanaa chahie jab tak samaaj ko isaki zarurat he
 This is our stand
 jo bhagwat ji ne kaha wo sahi shabdon main nahin rakhaa gaya
 Nowhere has it been said that the reservation policy needs to be reviewed
 jis bayaan kaa khandan kar rahe the wo sitambar, 2015 ke panchajnya main chapa tha jisamen sangh pramukh mohan bhagwat ne kaha tha, jaise apane samvidhan main saamaajik pichde varg par aadhaarit aarakshan niti kii baat he to uski raajnneeti ke bajaay jaisaa samvidhankaron ke man main tha, vaisaa usko chalaate to aaj ye saare prashn khadey nahin hote
 Ever since this provision came into the Constitution, it has been used as politics
 hamaara kahana he ki ek samiti bana do
 Those who take the representatives of politics also, but let those who are in service and who have thoughts in the interest of the whole country
 unako tay karne de ki kitne logon ke liye aarakshan aavashyak he
 How long will it be required
 in sab baton ko lagu karne kaa puraa adhikaar us samiti ke haath main ho
 Keep in mind that all these things are authentically applicable
 tippaniyan i do not know whether the rebuttal was printed in the next issue of Panchajanya
 25 oktober, 2015 ke 'dainik bhaskar' main chapa he ki mohan bhagwat ne kaha ki aarakshan sangh kaa vishay nahin he
 We do not study in terms of reservation
 phir bhaiyya ji joshi ko kyon kahana padaa ki kya aarakshan kaa phayda zaruuratmand tak pahunchaa, krimi layer par charchaa karne kii zarurat he
 What do you mean by affluent people? professor sukhdev thoraat or nitin tagade ne economik and polytical vikali main chape lekh main pesh kiya he

 Arun Jaitley immediately clarified the government's opinion on Bhaiyya Joshi's statement
 aarakshan kii jo vyavastha chal rahi he usamen koi badlaav nahin hone vaala he
 BJP has given this explanation without delay
 bijepi kya yahi baat jat samudaay se bhi kah rahi he
 He promised to provide reservation to weaker sections on economic grounds
 kya us par bhi party kii raay badal gai he
 From the BSP to the Congress, there is talk of reservation of poor sections on economic basis
 kya hua
 At the time when there was a white cap, the RSS first chose khaki and then black for its cap
 is bich sangh ke kapadon main kai baar badlaav bhi hue, lekin nagaur main hui pratinidhi sabha kii baithak main sangh ne tay kiya ki ab se half pant nahin pahana jayega
 According to the weather, this decision should have been made in winter, but even in summer people wear full pants
 ab swayamsevak khaaki kii jagah bhure rang kii patalun pahana karenge
 In Nagaur, Rajasthan, the general secretary of the union, Bhaiyya Joshi, said that in normal life, fulpant works
 hamane use sweekaar kiya he iske vishesh kaaran kuch bhi nahin he
 Bhaiyyaji would have explained the reasons for the change in detail
 aam taur par sangh ke swayamsevak dhoti kurta, kurta pajama or pant shart bhi pahante hai lekin shakha main ab phul pant main nazar aaenge
 It would turn out that half-baked farewell due to clumsy and unsympathetic fitting, or really no good teller stitched the half pants
 agar aap pahanaavon kii duniya kii khabar rakhte hai to half pant bhi kam lokapriy nahin he
 Big brands sell a variety of fitting half pants
 kya half pant kii vajah se sangh kii shakhaon kaa vistaar nahin ho rahaa tha
 For the last two years, the number of branches is increasing in the media
 isi nagaur main hui akhil bhartiya pratinidhi sabha kii baithak main sangh ke joint general secetry krishnagopal ne report pesh kii he ki pichley ek saal main rozaana lagane vaali shakhaon main 5524 shakhaaen judi hai
 That is, the number of morning branches has increased from 51,335 to 56,859
 'hindu' akhbaar ne apni report main ye chapa he
 PTI published a report in November last year
 is report ke anusaar das saal main 10,000 shakhaaen badi hai
 PTI quoting Joint Secretary Deepak Tamshetivar of Vidarbha has written that between November 2014 and November 2015, 6684 branches have been increased
 sangh ko bhi ek ap bana kar sari shakhaon kaa byora uplabdh kara dena chahie taaki swanyasevak ek-duusare kii shakhaon se jud saken
 Think BJP government makes an app for talk but why does the Sangh not make an app
 agar aisa koi ap ban jaae to hamen har baat ke liye rakesh sinha par nirbhar nahin rahanaa hoga
 Our people do not care who wears what
 bas daam kaa pataa nahin chalanaa chahie
 As soon as the price of the watch, suit and shawl is known, politics starts happening
 ab aate hai soch par
 Sometimes, in the name of creamy layer, the Sangh is anticipating the wind or preparing for the coming time
 ravivaar ko bhaiyyaji joshi se poocha gaya ki jat or patidaar aarakshan andolan ke bare main kya raay he to unka jawaab tha ki yah chintaa kii baat he
 When Dr
 Baba Saheb Ambedkar proposed reservation, he said in terms of social status and social justice
 anusuchit jati or janajati ke log bahut se kaarnon kii vajah se pichad gaye the isliye unke liye aarakshan ko ham sahi maanate hai
 a large section has benefited due to reservation
 isi bhaavana ke sandarbh main aarakshan kii maang honi chahie
 When affluent people demand reservation, it is not right thinking
 jo sampann hai unhen apane kuch adhikaar chhod dene chahie
 Do they mean Jat and Patidar movement by affluence or are they also pointing towards the affluent section of castes coming under reservation under the pretext of prosperity
 sangh ke bayanon main nirantarata bhi he or ek kism kii asthirataa bhi
 When Bhaiyya joshi was asked about the creamy layer, he replied, we have to think whether the benefit of reservation is reaching those who need it
 krimi layer ke mudde ko padhane or charchaa karne kii zarurat he
 It will not be right to comment now
 zaruuratmand ko aarakshan kaa laabh nahin mil rahaa he se kya matlab he
 Are the seats being left vacant, then Bhaiyya ji is talking about filling up soon
 krimi layer sirf obisi ke liye he
 Those earning more than six lakh are considered creamy layers and do not get reservation
 jab aarakshan sampann ko nahin mil rahaa he to sampann se bhaiyyaji joshi kaa kya matlab he
 Does the Sangh believe that Jats and Patidars are prosperous and not entitled to reservation
 to prachaarak rahe haryana ke mukhyamantri ne saaf-saaf manaa kyon nahin kiya
 His government has already promised to consider Jat reservation
 jabaki gujarat main bijepi sarkaar patidaar aarakshan se inkaar kar chuki he
 On November 3, 2015, Bhaiyya Joshi in Ranchi had said that reservation should remain as long as the society needs it
 yahi hamaara stand he
 What Bhagwat Ji said was not put in the right words
 kahin par nahin kaha gaya ki aarakshan niti kii samiksha kii zarurat he
 The statement he was refuting was printed in Panchjanya in September 2015, in which Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat said, as in his constitution, there is a reservation policy based on socially backward classes, rather than its politics as the constitutionalists had in mind If you used to run like that, today these questions would not have arisen
 samvidhan main jab se yah praavdhaan aa gaya tab se uskaa raajnneeti ke rup main upyog kiya gaya he
 We say make a committee
 jo raajnneeti ke pratinidhiyon ko bhi saath le lekin chale un logon kii jo sevaabhaavi ho tathaa jinke man main saare desh ke hit main vichaar ho
 Let them decide how much reservation is required for many people
 kitne din tak uski aavashyaktaa padegi
 The authority to implement all these things should be in the hands of that review
 dhyaan main rakhana hoga ki ye sari baaten pramanikta se lagu ho
 The comments mujhe jaankaree nahin he ki panchajnya ke agle ank main iskaa khandan chapa tha yaa nahin
 In the 'dainik Bhaskar' of October 25, 2015, Mohan Bhagwat has said that reservation is not the subject of the association
 aarakshan ke maamle main hamaara adhyayan nahin he
 Then why did Bhaiyya ji have to say if the benefit of reservation reached the needy, there is a need to discuss the creamy layer
 sampann log se kya matlab he
 Professors Sukhdev Thorat and Nitin Tagade have featured in an article published in the Economic and Political Weekly
 2012 ke neshnal sample survey ke rojgaar ke aankadon ke aadhaar par bataaya he ki 2012 main gair krishi sector main niyamit rup se selary kii naukari karne waalon kii sankhya 8
 56 crores
 inamen se 6 karod naukariyaan privet sector kii hai jo aarakshan ke daayre se baahar hai
 Now survived 2
 56 karod naukariyaan, jinamein se 40 fisadi asthaayee naukariyaan bhi hai
 Reservation in temporary jobs does not apply
 is hisaab se gaiyr krishi sector main sthaayee naukariyon kii sankhya ho jaati he 1
 54 crores
 yani 8
 Reservation was implemented in only 18 percent of 56 crore permanent jobs
 inamen anusuchit jati ke sthaayee karmchaariyon kaa hissaa 18
 It was only 5 percent
 bhaiyya ji joshi ke bayaan par turant arun jetali ne sarkaar kii raay saaf kar di
 There is no change in the reservation system that is going on
 bijepi ne bina deree ye safai de di he
 Is the BJP saying the same thing to the Jat community? usne aarthik aadhaar par kamazor tabakon ko bhi aarakshan dene kaa vaada kiya tha
 Has the party's opinion changed on that as well
 aarthik aadhaar par garib tabakon ke aarakshan kii baat to bispi se lekar congress bhi karti he
 What happened
 rajasthan ke nagaur main sangh ke general secetry bhaiyya joshi ne kaha ki saamaanya jivan main phulpant chalati he
 There is nothing specific about why we have accepted it
 bhaiyyaji badlaav ke kaarnon ke bare main vistaar se bataate to thik se charchaa hoti

 jis bayaan kaa khandan kar rahe the wo sitambar, 2015 ke panchajnya main chapa tha jisamen sangh pramukh mohan bhagwat ne kaha tha, jaise apane samvidhan main saamaajik pichde varg par aadhaarit aarakshan niti kii baat he to uski raajnneeti ke bajaay jaisaa samvidhankaron ke man main tha, vaisaa usko chalaate to aaj ye saare prashn khadey nahin hote
 Ever since this provision came into the Constitution, it has been used as politics
 hamaara kahana he ki ek samiti bana do

 How long will it be required
 in sab baton ko lagu karne kaa puraa adhikaar us samiti ke haath main ho

 tippaniyan i do not know whether the rebuttal was printed in the next issue of Panchajanya
 25 oktober, 2015 ke 'dainik bhaskar' main chapa he ki mohan bhagwat ne kaha ki aarakshan sangh kaa vishay nahin he
 We do not study in terms of reservation
 phir bhaiyya ji joshi ko kyon kahana padaa ki kya aarakshan kaa phayda zaruuratmand tak pahunchaa, krimi layer par charchaa karne kii zarurat he
 What do you mean by affluent people? professor sukhdev thoraat or nitin tagade ne economik and polytical vikali main chape lekh main pesh kiya he
 Based on the employment data of the 2012 National Sample Survey, it has been reported that in 2012, the number of regular salaries in the non-agricultural sector was 8
 56 karod thi
 Out of these, 6 crore jobs belong to the private sector which are outside the purview of reservation
 ab batch gayi 2
 56 crore jobs, 40 percent of which are temporary jobs
 asthaayee naukariyon main aarakshan lagu nahin hota he
 Accordingly, the number of permanent jobs in the non-agricultural sector becomes 1
 54 karod
 Ie 8
 56 karod sthaayee naukariyon ke maatr 18 fisadi main hi aarakshan lagu hua
 Of these, the share of the permanent employees of Scheduled Castes 18
 5 pratishat hi tha
 Arun Jaitley immediately clarified the government's opinion on Bhaiyya Joshi's statement
 aarakshan kii jo vyavastha chal rahi he usamen koi badlaav nahin hone vaala he
 BJP has given this explanation without delay
 bijepi kya yahi baat jat samudaay se bhi kah rahi he
 He promised to provide reservation to weaker sections on economic grounds
 kya us par bhi party kii raay badal gai he
 From the BSP to the Congress, there is talk of reservation of poor sections on economic basis
 kya hua
 The Sangh should also make an app and provide the details of all the branches so that volunteers can connect with each other's branches
 sochiye bhaajapa sarkaar baat-baat main ap banavaa detii he lekin sangh kyon ap nahin banavaata
 If such an app is created then we will not have to depend on Rakesh Sinha for everything
 hamaari janata ko is baat se fark nahin padataa ki koun kya pahentaa he
 Just the price should not be known
 ghadi, suut or shawl kii keemat kaa pataa lagate hi raajnneeti hone lagati he
 Now come to the thought
 kabhi samiksha to kabhi krimi layer ke naam par sangh hawa kaa rukh bhaanp rahaa he yaa aane vaale samay kii taiyaari kar rahaa he
 On Sunday, Bhaiyyaji Joshi was asked what is the opinion about Jat and Patidar reservation movement, then his reply was that it is a matter of concern
 jab doctor baba sahab ambedkar ne aarakshan kaa prastaav kiya tha, tab unhone saamaajik sthiti or saamaajik nyaay ke sandarbh main kaha tha
 The people belonging to the scheduled castes and tribes were left behind due to many reasons, so we consider reservation for them right
 aarakshan kii vajah se ek bade varg ko phayda hi hua he
 There should be a demand for reservation in the context of this sentiment
 jab sampann log aarakshan kii maang karte hai to yah sahi soch nahin he
 Those who are rich should give up some of their rights
 kya sampann se unka sirf matlab jat or patidaar andolan he yaa wo sampann ke bahaane aarakshan ke daayre main aane vaali jatiyon ke sampann tabake kii ore bhi ishaara kar rahe hai
 There is also consistency and a variety of instability in the Sangh statements
 bhaiyya ji joshi se jab krimi layer ke bare main poocha gaya to jawaab diya, hamen yah sochna hoga ki kya aarakshan kaa phayda un logon tak pahunch rahaa he jinhen isaki zarurat he
 The issue of creamy layer needs to be read and discussed
 abhi coment karnaa sahi nahin hoga
 What is meant by the needy is not getting the benefit of reservation
 kya siten khaali rah ja rahi hai to bhaiyya ji joshi jaldi bharne kii baat kar rahe hai
 The creamy layer is only for obcs
 chah lakh se zyada kamaane vaale krimi layer maane jate hai or unhen aarakshan nahin miltaa he
 When the affluent is not getting reservation, then what does Bhaiyyaji Joshi mean by affluent
 kya sangh yah maanata he ki jat or patidaar sampann hai or aarakshan ke hakdaar nahin he
 So why did the Haryana Chief Minister not expressly refuse unki sarkaar to jat aarakshan par vichaar karne kaa vaada kar chuki he
 While the BJP government in Gujarat has refused the Patidar reservation
 3 november, 2015 ko ranchi main bhaiyya ji joshi ne hi kaha tha ki aarakshan tab tak rahanaa chahie jab tak samaaj ko isaki zarurat he
 This is our stand
 jo bhagwat ji ne kaha wo sahi shabdon main nahin rakhaa gaya
 Nowhere has it been said that the reservation policy needs to be reviewed
 jis bayaan kaa khandan kar rahe the wo sitambar, 2015 ke panchajnya main chapa tha jisamen sangh pramukh mohan bhagwat ne kaha tha, jaise apane samvidhan main saamaajik pichde varg par aadhaarit aarakshan niti kii baat he to uski raajnneeti ke bajaay jaisaa samvidhankaron ke man main tha, vaisaa usko chalaate to aaj ye saare prashn khadey nahin hote

 tippaniyan i do not know whether the rebuttal was printed in the next issue of Panchajanya
 25 oktober, 2015 ke 'dainik bhaskar' main chapa he ki mohan bhagwat ne kaha ki aarakshan sangh kaa vishay nahin he
 We do not study in terms of reservation
 phir bhaiyya ji joshi ko kyon kahana padaa ki kya aarakshan kaa phayda zaruuratmand tak pahunchaa, krimi layer par charchaa karne kii zarurat he

 Arun Jaitley immediately clarified the government's opinion on Bhaiyya Joshi's statement
 aarakshan kii jo vyavastha chal rahi he usamen koi badlaav nahin hone vaala he
 BJP has given this explanation without delay
 bijepi kya yahi baat jat samudaay se bhi kah rahi he
 He promised to provide reservation to weaker sections on economic grounds
 kya us par bhi party kii raay badal gai he
 From the BSP to the Congress, there is talk of reservation of poor sections on economic basis
 kya hua
 When Dr
 Baba Saheb Ambedkar proposed reservation, he said in terms of social status and social justice
 anusuchit jati or janajati ke log bahut se kaarnon kii vajah se pichad gaye the isliye unke liye aarakshan ko ham sahi maanate hai
 a large section has benefited due to reservation
 isi bhaavana ke sandarbh main aarakshan kii maang honi chahie
 When affluent people demand reservation, it is not right thinking
 jo sampann hai unhen apane kuch adhikaar chhod dene chahie
 Do they mean Jat and Patidar movement by affluence or are they also pointing towards the affluent section of castes coming under reservation under the pretext of prosperity
 sangh ke bayanon main nirantarata bhi he or ek kism kii asthirataa bhi
 When Bhaiyya joshi was asked about the creamy layer, he replied, we have to think whether the benefit of reservation is reaching those who need it
 krimi layer ke mudde ko padhane or charchaa karne kii zarurat he
 It will not be right to comment now
 zaruuratmand ko aarakshan kaa laabh nahin mil rahaa he se kya matlab he
 Are the seats being left vacant, then Bhaiyya ji is talking about filling up soon
 krimi layer sirf obisi ke liye he
 Those earning more than six lakh are considered creamy layers and do not get reservation
 jab aarakshan sampann ko nahin mil rahaa he to sampann se bhaiyyaji joshi kaa kya matlab he
 Does the Sangh believe that Jats and Patidars are prosperous and not entitled to reservation
 to prachaarak rahe haryana ke mukhyamantri ne saaf-saaf manaa kyon nahin kiya
 His government has already promised to consider Jat reservation
 jabaki gujarat main bijepi sarkaar patidaar aarakshan se inkaar kar chuki he
 On November 3, 2015, Bhaiyya Joshi in Ranchi had said that reservation should remain as long as the society needs it
 yahi hamaara stand he
 What Bhagwat Ji said was not put in the right words
 kahin par nahin kaha gaya ki aarakshan niti kii samiksha kii zarurat he
 The statement he was refuting was printed in Panchjanya in September 2015, in which Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat said, as in his constitution, there is a reservation policy based on socially backward classes, rather than its politics as the constitutionalists had in mind If you used to run like that, today these questions would not have arisen
 samvidhan main jab se yah praavdhaan aa gaya tab se uskaa raajnneeti ke rup main upyog kiya gaya he
 We say make a committee
 jo raajnneeti ke pratinidhiyon ko bhi saath le lekin chale un logon kii jo sevaabhaavi ho tathaa jinke man main saare desh ke hit main vichaar ho
 Let them decide how much reservation is required for many people
 kitne din tak uski aavashyaktaa padegi
 The authority to implement all these things should be in the hands of that review
 dhyaan main rakhana hoga ki ye sari baaten pramanikta se lagu ho
 The comments mujhe jaankaree nahin he ki panchajnya ke agle ank main iskaa khandan chapa tha yaa nahin
 In the 'dainik Bhaskar' of October 25, 2015, Mohan Bhagwat has said that reservation is not the subject of the association
 aarakshan ke maamle main hamaara adhyayan nahin he
 Then why did Bhaiyya ji have to say if the benefit of reservation reached the needy, there is a need to discuss the creamy layer
 sampann log se kya matlab he
 Professors Sukhdev Thorat and Nitin Tagade have featured in an article published in the Economic and Political Weekly
 2012 ke neshnal sample survey ke rojgaar ke aankadon ke aadhaar par bataaya he ki 2012 main gair krishi sector main niyamit rup se selary kii naukari karne waalon kii sankhya 8
 56 crores
 inamen se 6 karod naukariyaan privet sector kii hai jo aarakshan ke daayre se baahar hai
 Now survived 2
 56 karod naukariyaan, jinamein se 40 fisadi asthaayee naukariyaan bhi hai
 Reservation in temporary jobs does not apply
 is hisaab se gaiyr krishi sector main sthaayee naukariyon kii sankhya ho jaati he 1
 54 crores
 yani 8
 Reservation was implemented in only 18 percent of 56 crore permanent jobs
 inamen anusuchit jati ke sthaayee karmchaariyon kaa hissaa 18
 It was only 5 percent
 bhaiyya ji joshi ke bayaan par turant arun jetali ne sarkaar kii raay saaf kar di
 There is no change in the reservation system that is going on
 bijepi ne bina deree ye safai de di he
 Is the BJP saying the same thing to the Jat community? usne aarthik aadhaar par kamazor tabakon ko bhi aarakshan dene kaa vaada kiya tha
 Has the party's opinion changed on that as well
 aarthik aadhaar par garib tabakon ke aarakshan kii baat to bispi se lekar congress bhi karti he
 What happened
 kya sampann se unka sirf matlab jat or patidaar andolan he yaa wo sampann ke bahaane aarakshan ke daayre main aane vaali jatiyon ke sampann tabake kii ore bhi ishaara kar rahe hai
 There is also consistency and a variety of instability in the Sangh statements
