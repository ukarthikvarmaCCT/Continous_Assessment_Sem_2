 You must have seen and heard many cases of marriage or marriage and divorce till date, but have not heard of any such case that due to the decree of the panchayat, a young woman can become a bride for only one day
 panchayat ne ek din purv yuvati kaa vivaah karaayaa tha usee panchayat ne choubees ghante ke baad uskaa talaak bhi karvaa diya
 Now the woman is wandering from rate to rate to get justice
 bihar ke purniya jile ke bysi se ai peedita ne jile ke police adheekshak amit lodha se milakar nyaay kii guhaar lagaai he

 peedita kaa kahana he ki uskaa to jivan barbaad ho gaya parantu doshiyon par karwai to ho
 He complains that after the divorce, the amount of meher (maintenance) that was given to him was also shared by the accused
 police ke anusaar bayasi thana kshetra ke chandragama panchayat ke bakharia gaanv nivasee mohammad hasanur evam peedita (jakarun nishaan) main prem tha
 The villagers were caught one day in a suspicious state by the villagers
 iske baad panchayat baithi or panchayat main hue faisle ke baad donon kaa nikaah kara diya gaya
 But just twenty four hours had passed since the victim became a bride that the Panchayat again pronounced this marriage as a decree of immediate divorce
 peedita kaa aarope he ki gaanv ke hi kuch logon ke bahekaave ke kaaran panchayat ne talaak kaa farmaan sunaaya
 After this divorce, the Panchayat gave a decision to give 70 thousand rupees as the amount of Meher to the victim
 idhar, police adheekshak lodha ne shuukravaar ko bataaya ki is maamle kii ek praathmiki bysi thana main darj kara di gai he tathaa police ne puure maamle kii jaanch shuru kar di he

 Like his cricketing career, Gautam Gambhir (gautam Gambhir), one of Team India's best 'opener' who has faced many ups and downs in politics, made a brilliant opening on the pitch of General Election 2019, BJP from East Delhi seat The ticket is expected to win with over three lakh votes
 gambhir kaa saamana congressi diggaj arvinder singh lavali or aam aadmi party kii aatishi se tha jinhone chunavi abhiyaan ke dauraan un par kai tarah ke aarope bhi lagaae the
 Arvind Kejriwal has lost his conscience and faith in this election, he will lose his power in 8 months! The more mud AAP has spread in Delhi, the more 'kamal' will blossom in Delhi !! Gambhir is going to hit an unbeaten hundred in his debut match on the basis of his popularity, social concern and 'modi wave'
 chunaav se ek maheenaa pehle hi bhartiya janata party main shaamil hue gambhir ne chunaav ayog dwaara jari rujhaanon ke baad twit main likhaa,‘yah naa to ‘lavali cover drive'or naa hi ‘aatishi ballebaaji' balki bhaajapa kii ‘gambhir' vichaardhaara ko logon kaa samarthan he
 thanks all

 The more mud you spread in Delhi, the more lotus will bloom in Delhi
 'gambhir kaa ishaara matdaan se thik pehle aatishi or aap dwaara un par mahila virdohi parche bantwane ke aaropon par tha
 Atishi accused Gambhir of distributing such pamphlets to discredit her and she was also crying at the press conference

 @ bjp4delhi @ bjp4india Gambhir challenged Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal by accusing him of hatching a conspiracy to either prove the allegations or quit politics
 isse pehle bhi unhone gambhir par do voter ai di rakhane ke aarope lagaate hue chunaav ayog se unki ummidavaari radd karne kii sifarish bhi kii thi
 Gambhir joined BJP only on 22 March
 Neither it's a ‘lovely' cover drive and nor it is an ‘aatishi' ballebaazi
 It's just the bjp's 'serious' ideology which people have supported
 Thanks a lot to all the @bjp4india and @bjp4delhi team-mates for getting this mandate

 sabase pehle disple-dizin or bild quality kii baat karen to Infinix Hot 8 main 720X1600 rijolution ke saath 6
 52-inch HD + 20: 9 drop notch display is given, which is much better
 acchhee baat ye he ki isamen drop noch panel main selfi camere ke alaava LED flash saport bhi aid kiya gaya he
 The rest is quite bright and punchy
 bild qualidity ke lihaaj se baat karen to iskaa rier panel plastic kaa he or yahaan back main hi fingerprint scinar tripal camera seoup ko jagah di gai he
 This panel is of gradient design and does not look much premium
 yahaan rhite main hi power batan or wolum rockers ko jagah di gai he
 There is a SIM slot in the left panel and there is also a slot for additional memory card
 bottm main yahaan micro USB port, spikar gril or 3
 Port is provided for 5mm headphone jack
 overol bild quality itani premium nahin he lekin keemat ke lihaaj se thik he
 Fingerprint scanner and face unlock response is also better
 haalanki chote haath waalon ko van hand handlling main dikkat ho sakati he
 Performance, Camera and Battery: This smartphone has 64GB of storage with 4GB of RAM
 tulanaatmak taur par dekhen to Realme C2 main is keemat main 2GB ram ke saath 32GB kii storage milti he
 Apart from this, it has an octa-core mediatek Helio P22 processor
 bataa den yahi procesar Realme C2 main bhi miltaa he
 At first glance, there is no lag in regular use like app switching
 saath hi eps bhi yahaan turant rispond kar rahe hai
 Talking about the battery, in this the company has given a large 5000mah battery in it and the company claims that it will be able to run the phone for 3 days
 thodi si baat software ko lekar karen to yahaan zyada pre loded eps nahin die gaye hai, jo maujuud bhi unhen remov kiya ja saktaa he
 Also, for better battery optimization, an app named Freezer has also been given here
 ab baat karte hai camere kii to aapako bataa den company ne is smartphone ke rier main tripal camera seoup diya he
 f 1 to customers in this setup
 8 aparchar ke saath 13MP primary camera, 2MP defth sensor or VGA lo-lite sensor milegaa
 Its primary camera is better in artificial lighting and day light, but its performance in low-light is not so good
 portret kii baat karen to yahaan Bokeh mod thik hi he, haalanki agej main aapako sharpaness nahin milegi
 The rest of the HDR response is also better
 ek acchhee baat ye he ki yahaan portret mod main skin tone par koi asar nahin ho rahaa he
 Talking about selfies, the quality is better in daylight and artificial lighting
 haalanki skin tone main thodi smudaness jarur he
 Apart from this, here is the front flash for low-light selfie
 is flash kaa upyog video colling ke dauraan bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 Here the focus of the primary camera is fast, but there is definitely some lag in the shutter
 overol ye smartphone bajet main ek acha phone he
 HD + is a better all-rounder with display, processor, large 5000mah battery, 4GB RAM and 64GB storage
 keval 6,999 rupee ke liye aapako body ko nazarandaaj karnaa hoga

 and tivi ke lokapriy serial bhaabi ji ghar par he kii puraani anguri bhabhi yani shilpa scindia ne sho kii produsar ke pati sanjay kohli par behad sansanikhej or gambhir aarope lagaae hai
 An FIR has been lodged against the Kohli couple on Shinde's complaint, but the couple is mummified by asking them to answer the charges against them in court
 shilpa ne apni exiaar main vistaar se us paristhitiyon kaa bakhaan kiya he jinka saamana unhen karnaa padaa
 Read the full statement of Shilpa recorded in the FIR: - The big allegations of old 'anguri Bhabhi', used to touch wrongly the producer's husband, FIR "I started working in Bhabiji Ghar Par Hai" from November 2010
 hamaara set palghar main tha
 From the very beginning, Sanjay Kohli was abusive with me
 sanjay aisi baaten karata tha ki shame aa jaae par main ignor kar detii thi kyonki tivi industry main is tarah ke log bhare pade hai
 Sanjay Kohli often tried to come to me on the sets during the shooting of the show
 is dauraan sanjay ne kai baar 'tum mujhe acchhee lagati ho', 'tum bahut sexi ho', 'tum bahut hot ho, main tumhaara bahut bada fain hum' jaise coment mujhapar kiye
 Shilpa Shinde, when i was out of the serial 'bhabi Ji Ghar Par Hain', used to openly touch my waist wrongly and used to say that i was not feeling well at all and when i refused to do it
 "come on so much goes on, be friendly", "gone by mistake" used to say so
 industry main sabakuch sho ke nirmaataaon ke haath main hone kii vajah se main kuch bol nahin sakati thi
 Anyway, my work money was with them and if i complained to them, then my work money which was suppressed by those people did not get back to me, because of this i kept quiet
 iske baad bhi sanjay kohli par koi fark nahin padaa
 Due to which incident happened to me, i started feeling very mentally disturbed
 maine sho kii produsar benifer ko apane saath hui ghatana ke bare main bataaya jis par benifer ne mujhe chup rahane ke liye kaha or dhamkee di ki agar main is bare main kisi se bhi baat karuungi to ve mujhe sho se baahar kar dengi or meraa kariyar bhi barbaad kar dengi
 Because they knew that the serial i am working in cannot do anything against the producer of the serial
 shilpa ke aaropon par boleen produsar, 'use or publicity nahin denge'agle din, sanjay kohli set par aae, us vakt main apane mechap room main thi
 Coming into the makeup room, he said, 'you like me very much, i don't want to remove you from the show
 ' mujhe tumhaare saath shaareerik sambandh banane hai tumhen jo chahie wo main tumhen duungaa'
 There is nothing wrong in this
 main hameshaa aapako ko-oparate karuunga or ye main apni wif se aksar bolta hum
 'anyway, you do not turn away from my eyes, how were you trying to comment on me
 us vakt main sanjay kohli ko apane se dur karne kaa prayaas kar rahi thi or unka virodh kar rahi thi
 At the same time, Bharat alias Pinku Patwa, the make-up artist of the serial, came out of the bathroom and saw the incident happening to me
 usee kshan sanjay kohli vahaan se chale gaye
 The other day i understood that Bharat, the makeup man, was fired
 uske baad phir se taarikh or samay to yaad nahin par sanjay kohli ne phir se shaareerik sambandh banane kii baat kii or kaha ki sho ke pramotion ke liye ham baahar chalate hai
 Stay there in someone's room and you solve me, i solve you
 agar isi tarah main virodh karti rahi to vah mere saath jabardastee bhi kar sakate hai
 At that time, i left from there
 On the second day, Sanjay called me in his office and threatened that if after this i do not continue working quietly in serial then he will replace me with another actress
 10 maheene pehle kuch or the shilpa scindia ke produsar par aropamujhe migraine or lo bldpressure jaisi samasya he or apane saath hui ghatana se mujh par iskaa kaaphi asar hone laga tha jis kaaran maine sho ke nirmaataa se chuttee maangi thi jis par unhone mujhe bataaya ki sho main abhi bahut kaam bachaa he or mujhase 10 din ke kaam ko 2 din main hi karvaa liya
 On March 3, 2016, i was discharged as an Unprofessional and accused me that i was demanding many things, so they are replacing me and got it announced in the media
 us dauraan mere teen maheene kii selary bhi un logon ne mujhe nahin di
 Even after doing so, they did not stop and they closed all the paths of my career
 jahaan kahin se bhi mujhe kaam karne ke ofer aate the wo log vahaan bhi meri badanaami karte the or meraa kaam band karvaa dete the
 Because of which i do not have work today ''

 us par aap kaayam hai?jiro los kaa kya matlab he, main 50 baar safai de chukaa hum
 When the government policy was that we should not process the auction
 yahi niti thi naa
 When there was no auction policy, then how are you saying loss on the basis of auction, it is a hypothetical loss in itself
 maine to itnaa hi kaha tha ki us vakt aisi niti nahin thi, to phir los kaa kya matlab hua
 Whenever you took a bold step, whether it was education or the matter of regulating the Internet, there was a case

 Samsung launched the Galaxy A8 + in India last month
 pehali jhalak main yah smartphone Galaxy Note 8 jaisaa lagata he
 But the two smartphones are quite different from each other
 hamane is smartphone ko jaancha parkhaa he or aapke liye lekar aae hai iskaa phul rivyuu
 In this review, we will know how this smartphone performs in real life testing, how its camera is, how is the backup, how fast, how accurate is multi tasking and is this smartphone for you? Apart from this, you will get answers to many questions in this review
 dizin or bild qualityise yuj karenge to kai baar log bhram main rahenge kii aap Galaxy Note 8 yuj kar rahe hai jo isse dugani keemat vaala smartphone he
 Build quality is solid and it is also premium
 isamen metal frem ke saath glass back diya gaya he jaisaa aapako Galaxy S8 main bhi miltaa he
 Because of this it is quite easy to hold
 yah smartphone is segment ke apane pratidvindi smartphone One Plus 5T or Honor View 10 ke mukaable thodaa baari he, lekin slee hone kii vajah se koi fark nahin padataa
 Fingerprints are due to the glass back, but less than expected
 iphone x ke mukaable isamen kam fingerprints padate hai
 Fingerprint scanner is given below the camera in the rear and LED flash is given on the right side of the camera
 rier panel ke chaaron kinare karvd hai, isliye grip acchhee banati he or ise yuj karnaa ek acha experience he
 With the phone you also get a cover which is good
 phone ke upar kii taraf micro esady or sim slot diya gaya he, dayee taraf spikar gril he neeche kii taraf yuasabi tip si slot or yearphone jaik he
 On the left is the volume rocker key and the SIM slot
 yani is smartphone main aap do sim or ek memory card laga sakate hai
 The display Galaxy A8 + has a 6-inch Infinity display, which has a resolution of 1080X2220 pixels
 aspct reshyo 18
 It is 5: 9
 isamen 2
 5D curved glass is installed
 pehali najar main aapako yah disple premiy lagata he, kyonki samsung kii yah khaasiyat bhi he ki wo apane hai and smartphone main shandaar disple detaa he
 It is bright and colorful and the AMOLED panel also makes it beautiful
 disple kaa color production kamaal kaa he or sanlite main bhi aap ise achche dekh sakate hai
 The viewing and gaming experience was good due to the low bezel
 olves on disple kaaphi sharp dikhti he or amolade panel kii vajah se yah or bhi khubasurat lagati he khaskar tab jab aapane olves on disple main becoground image yuj kiya he
 performancesamsung has set the Exynos 7885 octacore chipset in this smartphone
 yah procesar 14nm procesapar bana he or isamen do cortex-a73 kor lage hai jo 2
 Are 2ghz
 jabaki chah kor cortex-a53 hai or ye 1
 Are of 6ghz
 Galaxy Note 8 ke baad yah samsung kaa doosraa smartphone he jisamen 6GB ram diya gaya he
 Its internal memory is 64GB
 spacification jabardast hai or real life main yah khare bhi utarate hai
 Whether it is heavy gaming or multi-tasking
 yah kaaphi smood he
 Open many apps at once
 Loading time is negligible which you are not able to notice
 screen choti karke bhi aap ise yuj kar sakate hai
 During every high end smartphone review we run Asphalt 8: Airbone to test how it responds during gaming
 kuch eps khule bhi rahen becoground main to bhi aaraam se gaming kii ja sakati he aapako kai lag mahasoos nahin hoga
 However, it has felt lag on running it continuously for two to three times
 Galaxy A8+ main aapako Android 7
 1
 1 besd company kaa apana custom yujar intphes miltaa he jo duusare samsung ke smartphone jaise Galaxy S8 or Note 8 main bhi he
 Some pre-installed apps will also be found which have Google's essential apps, while apps like Power Point, Word, Linked In and One Drive are also given
 ek ap se duusare eps main switch karnaa kaaphi aasaan or fast he
 Chatting to watch videos by splitting the screen in two halves is also better
 iske multi tasking ke liye bhi yah smartphone kaaphi umdaa he
 Battery backup Galaxy A8 + has a 3,500mah battery
 khaas baat ye he ki ise aap jaldi charge kar sakate hai kyonki yah fast charging bhi saport karata he
 Within 45 to 50 minutes, you can fully charge it with the charger provided with it
 mixd yuj main yah subah se shaam tak chal sakati he or raat tak aapke paas itani bydaree hoti he ki aap charge main lagaakar bhi ise kaam kar saken
 However, the battery backup cannot be termed, because keeping the on-display always will consume more battery
 kul mila kar itnaa he ki aap phul charge karke puure din chalaa sakate hai, colling, web browjing, videos or soshal media sabakuch yuj karte hue
 Camera: Samsung has given two selfie cameras in a smartphone for the first time with the Galaxy A8 +

 7 is selfi ke liye isamen 16 megapixl or 8 megapixl kaa dual camera seoup diya gaya he
 Looking at the rear camera aperture, it seems that it will be great, but in real life it is not so
 rier camera se clic kii gai tasviren is smartphone segment ke lihaaj se shandaar nahin hai
 It cannot be called bad because it is an average
 outdoor photography behtareen he or clic kii gai tasviren shandaar lagati hai, lekin baat jab kam raushnee main photography kii ho to yahaan is smartphone ne hame niraash kiya he
 Colors are worth seeing in the pictures clicked in the light outside and it will also live up to your expectations
 selfi camere main boke effect he jo live focus ke naam se he
 While clicking the photo, you can adjust the background blur done by how much blur to keep
 camera department thodaa lo he, lekin aap niraash nahin honge
 If your budget allows, you can buy it
 is segment ke duusare smartfones ke mukaable zyaadaatar department main iskaa palada baari he
 Rating to date - 4 / 5 jammu-kashmir par china ke bayaan se congress bhadkimneesh tiwari ne twit kar sarkaar se poocha sawaalhankong, tibet ke mudde par ghira he chinashi jinping ke bharat daure se pehle china ne jammu-kashmir ke masale par bayaan diya he
 In the presence of Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan, who visited China, China spoke about following the UN rules on Jammu and Kashmir
 ab is bayaan par bharat main vivaad ho rahaa he
 Congress MP Manish Tiwari questioned the central government on this issue and said why not, India talks to China about Tibet, Hong Kong
 congress netaa manish tiwari ne guuruuvaar ko twit kiya ki agar shi jinping kah rahe hai ki unki nazar jammu-kashmir par he, to pradhanmantri yaa videsh mantralay kyon nahin kahata he ki bharat honkong main ho rahe loktantr ko lekar pradarshan ko dekh rahaa he, shinjiyang main ho rahe maanavadhikaar ke ulanghan, tibet kii sthiti or south china par china kii dakhal par hindustan nazar banaae hue he
 Xi Jingping says he is watching Kashmir but why does @ pmoindia / MEA not say 1) We are watching Pro Democracy protests muzzled in Hong Kong
 2 )we are watching human rights violations in Xinjiang
 3) We are watching continued oppression in Tibet 4) We are watching South China Sea — Manish Tewari (@manishtewari) October 10, 2019 China reversed statement on Kashmir! Has retracted his statement regarding beete dinon china kii ore se bayaan diya gaya tha ki jammu-kashmir ke masale par bharat-pakistan ko aapas main baat kerani chahie
 But when Imran Khan arrived in China, China took a U-turn from its statement and said that China is closely monitoring the issue of Jammu and Kashmir
 haalanki, china kii is tippanee par bharat ne kadaa virodh jataayaa or kaha ki kashmir kaa masalaa bharat kaa aantarik mudda he aise main koi doosraa desh isapar bayaan naa de te behatar hoga
 Read this: modi-jinping's mega meeting in Mahabalipuram, PAK will be defeated over Kashmir! India will show China a mirror Detracts from
 kyonki is vakt china prashasit honkong main loktantric pradarshan chal rahaa he, lekin chini sarkaar ise dabaane main juty hui he
 Apart from this, Uygar Muslims are also being pressed in China, which is the eye of the whole world
 ise padhein: bharat kii china kii do took- kashmir hamaara aantarik maamla, bayaan dene se bachein duniya ke deshmuslim ekta kii baat karne vaala pakistan bhi is masale par chuppi saadhe hue he
 In such a situation, if China raises the issue of Jammu and Kashmir, then everyone has an eye on what is India's stand

 Assembly elections in Gujarat are near and political equations are also changing rapidly

 This time, apart from the Aam Aadmi Party, another new party can enter the fray

 isi ke baad sambit paatra ne ovaisi par tippanee kii thi
 The Rajasthan government had recently passed the Panchayat Ordinance to provide for educational qualification in the 2015 Panchayati Raj elections
 iske tahat sarpanchon ke liye 8veen paas or jila parishad sadasyon ke liye 10veen kii marksheet zaruri kar di gai thi, lekin janata bhi system se paar paanaa acchhee tarah se jaanati he
 In Rajasthan, where 1872 sarpanches have been elected, 746 have charges against them for imposing fake degrees and mark sheets
 jaise- dausa ke hingota gaanv main haal hi main sarpanch chuni gayi mamata kumari, jo philhal faraar hai, un par farzi marksheet or transfar certificate lagaakar chunaav ladane kaa aarope he
 Not only Mamta, many more sarpanches are surrounded by this charge
 darasal rajasthan main sarpanch kaa chunaav ladane ke liye 8veen paas hone kaa jo kanoon pichley saal bana he, uski vajah se rajya ke gramin hisson ke 80 fisadi log chunaav ladane kii yogyata kho baithe hai
 Now these people are working with fake certificates
 rajasthan main panchayat raaj mantri rah chuke or ab grahamantri gulab chand kataaria ne mana, 'jahaan hazaron log chune gaye hai vahaan kuch aise bhi log hai, jinhone galat marksheet dekar chunaav ladaa or jeeta bhi
 If an FIR is registered against him, action will be taken
 ' unhone mana ki saare milakar kareeb 600-700 aise maamle hai
 At present, the government has received complaints against 746 out of more than nine thousand elected sarpanches, out of which an FIR has been filed against 479
 rajya ke tonk zile main police kaa ek panchayat chunaav prakaran cell bhi bana diya gaya he, jo in maamalon kii jaanch kar rahaa he
 The cell has recently arrested a woman sarpanch Shimla Devi Meena
 wo tonk ke badoli gaanv kii sarpanch bani thi
 He had a certificate of Herbert School, an English medium school in Kota
 panchayat chunaav prakaran cell ke prabharee or is maamle ke jaanch adhikari bhagwaan sahay sharma ne bataaya, 'chunaav ke samay jo naam nirdesan form hai or transfar certificate hai, unki jaanch maine kota jaakar kii
 He also contacted the District Education Officer and investigated the Herbert Children's School, but there was no evidence of the release of the marksheet
 'tippaniyan There is a school in Barmer, which has very much helped the public representatives
 kotidiyon kii dhaani ke is sarkari madhyamik skool se 100 se zyaada farzi certificate jari kiye gaye
 35 of them have also won elections
 philhal police skool ke dastavezon kii jaanch kar rahi he
 Obviously, the government thought that illiterate people should stay away from power in a democracy
 lekin anpadh logon ne padhe-likhe logon ke saath milakar rasta nikaal liya
 After all, if these people were not there, where would they get the certificate from? rajasthan main jahaan 1872 sarpanch chune gaye hai, unamem se 746 ke khilaaf farzi degree or marksheet lagane ke aarope hai
 For example, Mamta Kumari, recently elected sarpanch in Hingota village of Dausa, who is currently absconding, is accused of contesting elections by putting on fake marksheets and transfer certificates
 sirf mamata hi nahin, kai or sarpanch is aarope se ghire hai
 In fact, due to the legislation passed in Rajasthan last year to pass the 8th to contest the sarpanch, 80% of the people of rural parts of the state have lost the ability to contest
 ab ye log farzi certificate ke sahare kaam kar rahe hai
 Former Minister of Panchayati Raj in Rajasthan and now Home Minister Gulab Chand Kataria admitted, 'where thousands of people have been elected, there are some people who have contested and won by giving wrong marksheets
 agar unke khilaaf FIR darj hui he to karrwahee hogi
 'he admitted that there are around 600-700 such cases altogether
 philhal sarkaar ke paas nau hazaar se zyaada chune gaye sarpanchon main se 746 ke khilaaf shikaayatein mili hai, inamen se 479 ke khilaaf FIR bhi darj hui he
 a police panchayat election case cell has also been formed in Tonk district of the state, which is investigating these cases
 cell ne haal hi main ek mahila sarpanch shimla devi meena ko giraftaar bhi kiya he
 She became the sarpanch of Badoli village in Tonk
 unhone kota ke ek angrezi madhyam skool herbert skool kaa certificate lagaaya tha
 Bhagwan Sahay Sharma, in-charge of the Panchayat Election Case Cell and the investigating officer of the case told, “I checked the name guidance form and transfer certificate at the time of the election, going to Kota
 vahaan jila shiksha adhikari se bhi sampark kiya or herbert children skool kii jaanch kii to vahaan se marksheet jari hone kaa subut nahin mila
 Comments barmer kaa ek skool to aisa he, jisane bahut man lagaakar janata ke numaayindon kii madad kii
 More than 100 fake certificates were issued from this government secondary school in Kottidi's Dhani
 inamen se 35 chunaav jeet bhi chuke hai
 Police are currently investigating school documents
 jaahir he, sarkaar ne sochaa ki anpadh log loktantr main satta se dur rahen to behatar
 But illiterate people along with educated people found a way out
 aakhir ye log na hote to unhen certificate kahaan se milte

 Sushma said, Chidambaram's argument was a later thought argument that he did not mislead the CVC selection panel and also that the Leader of the Opposition is making baseless allegations
 unhone kaha, maine unka :chidambaram: bayaan dekha he
 i would only say that if he knew that the case against Thomas was pending, then it was the first duty of the government to make the selection committee aware of it
 unhone aisa nahin kiya
 Attacking Chidambaram, he said, "what he is saying now is the arguments later thought, this fact is completely irrelevant
" uttar pradesh or bihar upachunaav ke niraashajanak nattejey bhartiya janata party ke liye chintaa kaa sabab ban gaye hai
 In particular, losing the Gorakhpur and Phulpur Lok Sabha seats of UP is being considered a big blow to the party
 haalanki, apni paramparaagat gorakhpur seat par haar ke baad upi ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath iske peeche ati-aatmavishvaas ko vajah bataa rahe hai
 But the party high-command has summoned him to Delhi
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki yogi adityanath ko aaj dilli bulaayaa gaya he
 Where in the evening he will meet BJP National President Amit Shah
 mana ja rahaa he ki is baithak main gorakhpur or phulpur upachunaav ke nateezon par charchaa ho sakati he
 This meeting will be held between Amit Shah and Yogi Adityanath at 5 pm on Saturday evening
 bataa den ki isse pehle yogi adityanath haar ke baad apane kai kaarykram radd kar die the
 Yogi canceled all his political programs to be held on Thursday
 tay kaarykram ke mutabik yogi adityanath ko gonda janaa tha, vahaan par yogi ko 4 divasiy lok kala mahotsav main hissaa lenaa tha
 But now he will be replaced by Deputy Chief Minister Dinesh Sharma at the festival
 kaarykram main yogi ko nanaaji deshmukh kii murti kaa anaavaran karnaa tha
 The results of the by-elections in gorakhpur-phulpur Lok Sabha seat were declared on 14 March
 gorakhpur se yogi adityanath or phulpur se dipti siem keshav prasad maurya 2014 main saansad bane the
 But this seat was vacated after getting the responsibility of CM and Deputy CM, after which voting was held here on 11 March
 bataa den ki ab takapurvanchal kii gorakhpur sitako bijepi kaa sabase majboot durg mana jaataa rahaa he, lekin upachunaav main ye surakshit kila darak gaya
 With the support of the BSP, the SP has won the victory in the by-election in Gorakhpur Lok Sabha seat, which has been invincible for BJP for the last 30 years
 bijepi ummidavaar ko gorakhpur sansadeey seat se sirf nahin haar hi nahin mili balki jis gorakhnath math ke yogi adityanath mahant hai, us par bhi 2014 loksabhaa chunaav se kam vot mili hai
 BJP candidate Upendra Shukla received only 182 votes at the Gorakhnath Math booth (booth number 250)
 jabaki 2014 ke chunaav main yogi adityanath ko 233 vot mila tha
 However, Gorakhnath Math is the biggest center of the politics of Yogi and Gorakhpur for the last three decades
 vahiin haar par yogi adityanath ne kaha tha ki ham is (basapa-sapa) gathbandhan ko samajhane main fail rahe, jiskaa ek kaaran atiaatmavishvaas bhi he
 Both elections are a lesson for us, it needs a lot of review

 The burning of paddy straw, the remnants of the Kharif crop, has become a source of intense smoke already in the entire Punjab and Haryana

 The steps taken by the state governments to discourage farmers from setting fire to the paddy residue had virtually no effect

 The Congress government led by Amarinder Singh in Punjab last week also directed the deputy commissioner to put a red mark on the land document (khasra Girdawari) of the disobedient farmers
 bhuswamiyon ko yah chetavanee di gai thi ki aise nishaan hone par unhen coparative socity se karj or kheti ke upkaran uplabdh karaane se inkaar kiya ja saktaa he

 Farmers want either the government to provide the necessary machinery for sowing or Rs 200 per quintal to compensate for the high cost of separating the straw from the soil

 Agricultural experts say that tools such as the 'happy Cedar' suggested by the Punjab Agricultural University can be used for winter wheat cultivation, which does not require the removal of paddy stubble

 a UGC official said that the commission has decided to link the Aadhaar card to the bank account of the students so that scholarship and fellowship can be provided to them easily
 vishvavidhyalayon evam collejon ko is par amal karne ko kaha gaya he
 For this purpose the UGC has asked universities to appoint a regional officer on priority basis who will help the students in the context of Aadhaar card and keep an eye on the institutions
 adhikari ne kaha ki bhartiya vishisht pahchaan praadhikaar ne desh ke prayek naagarik ko vishisht pahchaan sankhya ‘aadhaar’ pradaan karne kaa nirnay kiya he jo kalyaan yojanaon par prabhavi amal main sahaayak hoga
 He said that under this initiative, it has been decided to link the cash transfer directly to the bank account of the students
 adhikari ne bataaya ki aise adhikariyon kii niyukti vishvavidhyalay se sambhddha prayek kalejon ke liye karnaa anivaary hoga jo aadhaar card or chaatravrutti aadi se jude vishyon par rajya sarkaron se samanvay sthapit karenge
 The UGC has sent a note to universities in this regard and has asked to take this work forward at a fast pace
 vishvavidhyalay anudaan ayog ne chaatro se bhi aadhaar card praapt karne kii disha main pahal karne ko kaha he
 However, no date has been announced yet for the students to get the Aadhaar card
 vishvavidhyalayon evam collejon se aadhaar panjikaran kaary ke liye rajya evam centre ke adhikariyon se samanvay sthapit karne kaa bhi suzav diya gaya he
 Under the current practice, only after getting approval and recognition from the university, students send applications to UGC for fellowship
 iske baad rakam vishvavidhyalay ke khate main hastantarit hoti he or chaatro ko check ke jariye dhan praapt hota he
 These trends are in the context of various schemes like JRF, Rajiv Gandhi Fellowship, CSIR Fellowship, Maulana Azad Fellowship
 ayog ne vishvavidhyalayon evam kalejon se gunvatttapurna paathyakram kaa vikaas karne, daakhile kii prakriya ko paardarshee or behatar banane tathaa pariksha sudhaar par teji se amal karne kaa suzav diya he
 ugc's Educational and Administrative Reforms Scheme has been added in the 12th Plan with the condition of granting recognition to the institute and financial assistance

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi today said that the Muslims of India will fail al-qaeda, because the nature of terrorism in India has not originated from its soil but has been exported
 modi ne aaj yahaan council on fahrren relations main die apane sambodhan main do took shabdon main kaha ki aatankwaad se raajnneetik napha nuksaan kii bina par nahin ladaa ja saktaa or ise shikast dene ke liye desh, jati, dharm se upar uthakar maanavtaa ke aadhaar par puri duniya ko ekajute hona hoga
 The Prime Minister regretted that many countries of the world could never understand the abominable form of terrorism
 sambodhan ke baad vahaan upasthit logon ke prashnon kaa jawaab dete hue pradhanmantri ne kaha ki bharat ke musalmaan al-kaayda ko 'fail' kar denge
 He said, 'you must have seen that the nature of terrorism in India does not originate from its soil but it has been exported
 ' In response to questions asked in relation to the declaration of al-qaeda's flagship al-qaeda branches in India, he said that India is a country of Lord Buddha and Mahatma Gandhi and its citizens can never support terrorism
 gauratlab he ki america yatra se pehle vahaan ke ek samachar channel ko diye intervyuu main modi ne kaha tha, 'bharat ke musalmaan desh ke liye jienge, desh ke liye marenge or desh kaa kabhi bura nahin chahenge
 'he said,' With the mindset of weighing terrorism from different scales or calling any terrorism as 'good' and calling someone as 'bad' or not allowing terrorism to run in a country that likes and not running terrorism in a country that doesn't like it
 It cannot be fought together
 ' Yoga guru Baba Ramdev denied the possibility of forming a new political party, saying that he is not disillusioned with Prime Minister Narendra Modi yet, as he had two more years to fulfill the promises made in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 Have survived

 ' The 2019 Lok Sabha elections are going to be very interesting
 sabaki najar desh kii sabase zyada siton vaale soobe uttar pradesh par lagi hai
 In such a situation, there are 5 such seats in up's Purvanchal, where the reputation of veterans is at stake
 isamen pradhanmantri narendra modi, unki cabinet main sahyogi, kaddavaar netaa sapa sangrakshak mulaayam singh or arpyen singh jaise diggaj netaa shaamil hai
 maya-akhilesh alliance in Uttar Pradesh and Congress general secretary Priyanka Vadra's political entry as Purvanchal incharge has made Purvanchal's political contest even more interesting
 pichley do loksabhaa chunaavon ke voting pattern ye bataata he ki in paanch siton par ye donon factor agar kaam kar gaye to ek bade mantri or upi bijepi adhyaksh kii siten chin sakati hai
 These five seats are - Banaras, Azamgarh, Mirzapur, Chandauli and Kushinagar
 bataa den ki 2014 main prachand modi lahar ke baavjood in paanch main se 3 siton par congress ke vot bade the, jisamen pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa loksabhaa kshetra varanasi bhi shaamil tha
 However, if we look at the voting pattern of Varanasi, the parliamentary seat of PM, then Congress, SP-BSP and Aam Aadmi Party contested elections together, they will not be able to defeat the Prime Minister
 aakhir aisa sambhav kaise?samaajawaadee party or bispi ke gathbandhan or priyanka ke chunavi samar main utarane ke baad 2014 or 2009 loksabhaa chunaavon ke voting pattern dekha jaae to in paanch siton par sapa-basapa ke voter teji se paala badalte hue najar aate hai
 For example, Bahujan Samaj Party lost about 67 per cent of the votes in the Varanasi seat in 2014 elections and the Samajwadi Party lost about 63 per cent of the votes
 pradhanmantri narendra modi kii viraat jeet or arvind kejariwal ko mili 2 lakh se zyada voton ne banaras main sapa-basapa kii pole kholkar rakh diya
 This is the reason why the two are entering the electoral arena together
 congress or sapa-basapa gathbandhan donon kii najar purvanchal kii in paanchon siton par he
 However, currently the NDA currently holds 4 seats from these five seats
 varanasidesh kii sabase hai profile seat he varanasi, purvanchal main priyanka ke maidan main utarane kii khabaron ke bich yahaan chunaav ko or rochak bana diya he
 In 2014, only the Samajwadi Party and bsp's vote share slipped
 jabaki is lahar ke baavjood congress ke voter unke saath barkaraar rahaa tha
 Most of the SP-BSP votes were shifted towards Modi and Kejriwal, but the funny thing is that the Congress vote was increased by 14 percent
 jabaki sapa ko 63 fisadi to bispi ko 67 fisadi voton kaa nuksaan hua tha
 According to the data, the SP-BSP together does not seem to compete with Prime Minister Modi
 yahi nahin agar sampurna vipaksh, jisamen congress or aam aadmi party bhi mil jaati he to bhi modi se lagbhag 2 lakh vot peeche najar aa rahi he
 Anupriya Patel, the current MP from Mirzapur Mirzapur and nda's associate Apna Dal president, may face difficulties this time
 modi sarkaar main swasthya env parivaar kalyaan rajyamantri anupriya ke liye mirzapur jeetna ek kathin chunauti ban sakati he
 In 2014, BSP candidate Samudra Bind received 40 percent more votes
 haalanki 2009 ke mukaable bispi ko 9 fisadi zyada vot mili the
 While Samajwadi Party lost 50 per cent of the votes
 
 a shocking statistic here is that the Congress also had a 174 per cent increase in votes
 is baar sapa or basapa anupriya ko kadi takkar to denge lekin unhen haraa paane wo ab bhi kaamyaab nahin ho paaenge, jabatak congress unke saath na aae
 Previous electoral figures show that if SP-BSP and Congress combine here, Anupriya Patel's chair could be in danger
 haalanki congress in ummid main bhi hogi ki priyanka ke aane ke baad wo is seat par anupriya patel ko sidhi takkar de sake, kyonki mirzapur unki paramparaagat seat rahi he or aazaadee ke baad se congress ko yahaan 6 baar jeet mil chuki he
 Chandauli In 2014, one third of the voters of Chandauli Lok Sabha seat were won by Mahendra Nath Pandey and sent to Lok Sabha
 unhone bispi ke anil kumaar maury ko kareeb dedh lakh voton se haraaya tha
 But statistics show that this time the SP-BSP alliance has laid thorns in his path
 2014 main mahendra pandey ko 4
 14 lakh votes were received, while the SP BSP got 4 lakh 61 thousand votes on this seat
 aise main agar gathbandhan apana pradarshan doharaaya to bijepi ke liye ye seat gavanni pad sakati he
 At the same time, if the Congress too joins the coalition, then Mahendranath Pandey will be in a very difficult situation and he may have to face defeat by more than 70 thousand votes
 azamgarhazamgarh ek aisi seat he jahaan espi-bispi ke gathbandhan ko lekar koi khaas fark nahin padane vaala he
 In this Muslim and Yadav dominated area, Mulayam buried the flag on his own
 2014 main unhone bijepi ke ramakant yadav ko kareeb 50 hajaar voton se haraaya tha
 The Samajwadi Party received 175 percent more votes than in 2009
 aise main jaahir he ki 2019 main unke saath bispi bhi jud gai he jiskaa unhen sidhaa phayda milegaa
 In the five seats of Purvanchal which are being discussed, Congress votes have been reduced in 2 seats
 inamen se azamgarh seat bhi ek he
 Total 3 to Mulayam Singh Yadav
 4 lakh vot mili the or agar inamen bispi ke vot jod diye jaaen to ye aankada 6 lakh ke paar chalaa jaataa he
 That is, if Mulayam fought from here, his victory would be confirmed
 kushinagarakushinagar seat sahi myanon main priyanka gandhi ke liye chunauti bhari siton main se ek he
 In 2014, BJP wrested this seat from veteran Congress leader and former Union Minister RPN Singh
 yahaan ke bhi aankade kaaphi rochak hai, arpyen ko 2009 ke mukaable 27 fisadi zyada vot mili the, lekin bijepi ke rajesh pandey ne unhen 85 hajaar se zyada voton se maat dekar sansad pahunche the
 Rajesh Pandey received around 39 per cent votes, 10 per cent more than RPN
 aankade bataate hai ki is seat par congress ko jeet tabhi milegi jab unhen sapa–basapa kaa saath mili
 If this happens, then the Congress candidate got about 1 from BJP
 5 lakh vot zyada mil sakate hai
 In 2009, RPN defeated Swami Prasad Maurya of BSP here
 haalanki soobe ke 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav se pehle swami prasad bijepi kaa daaman tham liya or maujuuda samay main yogi sarkaar main mantri hai
 Here is a record of the data on 5 popular seats of Purvanchal
 lekin sabhi kehete hai raajnneeti main 2 or 2 chaar nahin hote hai
 There will be many hands till the election, many games will be spread and many new players can also get on the board, so the real strength is hidden in the hands of the voters

 Former Delhi Chief Minister and senior Congress leader Sheila Dixit died today
 dilliwaale unhen ek shandaar mukhyamantri ke taur par hameshaa yaad rakhenge jinhone dilli ko sajaayaa-sanvaara
 She was the Chief Minister of Delhi for three consecutive times
 rashtriya rajdhani ko viksit karne ko lekar unhone shandaar kaam kiya
 Sheila Dixit is considered to be a major contributor in setting up flyovers, roads, DTC bus services, hospitals, universities and metros in Delhi
 blue line bas ko hataakar naye kism kii bason ko ditisi ke bede main shaamil karne jaise kadam bhi unhone hi uthaaya tha
 Sheila Dixit had arranged for CNG as Chief Minister to make Delhi pollution free
 aaj dilli ko fliover or ring road ke liye janaa jaataa he
 Ring road has a big role in reducing traffic
 is ring ko aakaar dene main bhi shila dikshit ne badi bhoomika nibhaai thi
 The ring road structure was shaped and expanded during his tenure as chief minister
 isiilie desh ke lokapriy mukhyamantriyon main unka naam hameshaa liya jayega
 a benign image was a major reason for his success
 yah to saaf he ki bhugolic, shaikshik, saanskrithik or aarthik taur par dilli khushhaal rajya he, jahaan samasyaayein apekshaakrit kam dekhne ko milti hai
 Let us know that a lot of work was done in Delhi with the skill of Sheila Dixit
 haalanki vah bhaagyashaalee bhi raheen or halaat aise bane ki sab kuch unke paksh main hota chalaa gaya
 At one time Delhi was considered a BJP stronghold, but Sheila Dixit was the leader who drove the Congress out of power by taking Delhi out of the bjp's possession
 centre sarkaar kii ore se apni yojanaon ke prachaar prasar ke liye vigyapanon par karodon rupye kharch kiye janaa nai baat nahin he
 But now famous comics characters like Chacha Chaudhary are also being taken to promote the schemes of the Narendra Modi government
 is tarah kii kitabon ko sarv shiksha abhiyaan ke tahat paathya pustakon ke alaava bacchon ke anya adhyayan (extra Curricular Reading) ke liye prakashit kiya gaya he
 These are to be distributed to students from fifth to tenth grade
 ensipi saansad supriya sule ne is mudde ko uthaaya he
 According to Supriya, 'chacha Chaudhary' comics are being used to show how beneficial are the five schemes brought by Prime Minister Modi
 supriya hairaani jataati hai ki is comics ko kendriya maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantralay ke nirdesh par maharashtra ke rajya shiksha vibhaag ne taiyaar kiya he or rajya ke sabhi jila parishad skulon main baanta ja rahaa he
 There is not only one such book but many books on various issues
 ek kitaab main piem modi kii biography he
 There is a book on former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 ek kitaab main comic karactor miki mouse kaa bhi istemaal kiya gaya he
 It is being told that such books have been printed in all the regional languages
 baraamati se saansad supriya sule ne pune main press conference main marathi bhashaa main prakashit ‘chachaa choudhary ani modi’ (chachaa choudhary or modi) naamak kitaab ko dikhaaya
 Supriya Sule alleged that the central government has gone to such an extent that the BJP is not even leaving school children to promote the government's schemes
 comics marathi bhashaa main he
 Supriya Sule said, 'children should develop a good reading habit, but it is a pity that such books are being distributed to the Government
 ye khushi kii baat he ki isamen swatchta kaa paath he
 But what does it mean to have a photo of Modi Saheb on every page, on the front, on the back
 isaki jagah sant gadge baba yaa anya kisi rashtriya netaa kii tasviir bhi istemaal kii ja sakati thi
 This would have followed any role model for the coming generation
 lekin dukh kii baat he ki sarkaar nihit swaarth ke liye khud ko hi pramot kar rahi he
 Not only the use of petrol pumps for this, now it has reached such an extent that education is also being made for this
 desh kaa itihaas gavaah he ki kisi bhi party ne apni vichaardhaara ko badhaane ke liye shiksha ke kshetra kaa istemaal nahin kiya
 It is sad that government machinery is constantly being used for its promotion
 ’is mudde par prasiddh shikshavid heramb kulkarni ne india today se kaha, ‘is sarkaar ko apni prashansa kaa baaja bajaane kii aadat he
 The reality is that it does not have much to tell in the name of its work
 yahi vajah he ki bijepi sarkaar schuli bacchon ko bhi apane propaganda ke liye nahin chhod rahi he
 The central government is also interfering in education
 ye bahut dukhad he
 RTI activist Vihar Dhurve says that Modi's picture has been used on every page of the book, which means that BJP is involved in promoting Modi more
 or isamen bacchon ke liye poorak stareey pathan ko bahut kam sandesh he
 a government official, on the condition of anonymity, told that the contents of 3000 books were called from 80 publishers, out of which 1600 books were shortlisted, which were printed by 69 publishers
 supriya sule ne ‘chachaa choudhary ani modi’ naam kii jis marathi comics ko press conference main dikhaaya, uske pehle pej kaa hindi anuwaad he-“modi ne duniya main apane ko leader ke taur par sabit kiya he
 In his leadership, the whole world is saying that India is changing
 ve dinamen 20 ghante kaam karte hai or bharat kii behatari ke liye yojanaayen banaate hai
 These schemes are -1
 ujjwala yojana2
 Save daughter, teach daughter 3
 digital india4
 Demonetisation 5
 gstisi pej par bain ore chachaa choudhary kaa paatr kehete dikhataa he- ham sab ko in yojanaon main hissaa lekar inhen safal bananaa chahie
 By doing this, the country will move forward
 comics ke anya pannon par ladakiyon ko har kshetra main badhaava dene ke liye ‘beti bachaao, beti padhaao’, notebandi, jiesti, digital pement, ujjwala yojana aadi kaa ullekh kiya gaya he

 sarkaar ne online khudara bazaar plateform ke kshetra main 100 pratishat pratyaksh videshi nivesh (epadiai) kii anumati de di he taaki desh main or zyada pratyaksh videshi nivesh ho
 It is clear in the guidelines of the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) that FDI will not be allowed in its retail sales model through e-commerce by holding goods
 vaishvik online khudara companiyaan aimajon or ibe aadi bharat main online market plateform kaa parichaalan kar rahi hai
 Foreign companies also invest in domestic companies like Flipkart and Snapdeal in this area
 lekin, vibhinn online retail modelon main epadiai ko lekar abhi tak koi spasht dishanirdesh nahin tha
 To bring clarity, DIPP has also defined e-commerce as the model of online retailing of goods in inventory and market place model ie running of online market platform for retail business
 market place model se taatpary kisi i-commers unit dwaara digital or electronic network par iti plateform uplabdh karana he
 In this model the e-commerce unit will play only the role of liaison between buyer and seller
 vahiin, inventary model se taatpary un i-commers gatividhiyon se he jisamen vastuon or sevaaon kaa bhandar i-commers unit ke paas he or ise kanjayumors ko sidhe bechaa jaataa he
 However, the guideline states that an e-commerce company will not be allowed to make more than 25 percent of total sales to any vendor or group company in its market place
 diipipi ne kaha ki niti main spashtataa ke liye i-commers sector main epadiai par dishanirdesh taiyaar kiye gaye hai
 The government has already allowed 100 percent FDI in business to business (B2B) e-commerce
 dishanirdeshon ke tahat i-commers se taatpary vastuon or sevaaon kii online kharid farokht se he
 This includes the purchase of digital products on digital and and electronic networks
 digital or electronic network main computer, tivi channel or anya internet aplication shaamil hai
 DIPP said that e-commerce marketplaces can provide support services to sellers in the form of warehouses, logistics, order fulfillment, call centers, payment collection and other services
 haalanki, is tarah kii ikaayiyon kaa inventary par swaamitv kaa adhikaar nahin hoga
 Such ownership would lead to the business model being an inventory based model

 There may be some shortage of firecrackers in Diwali, but if the firecrackers are harming our health and harming the environment, then we need to think properly about their use
 sarvocch nyaayalay ne apane haal ke faisle main pataakhon kaa prayog karne kii ijaajatadivaliki raat aath se 10 baje ke bich de di
 During this period, the level of pollution in Delhi and other metros will definitely increase
 diwali kii dhooma-dhadaam ke bich swasthya se judi samasyaon se apane ko kis tarah se bachein va pataakhon se kis tarah bujurg va biimaar log apni swasthya kii dekhbhaal karen
 JP Hospital's Senior Specialist in Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Dr
 gyanendra agarwal ne yah poochne par ki dama ke marij yaa aam vyaktiyon par pataakhon ke dhuen kaa asar kaise hota he? dow
 Aggarwal said that Diwali, the festival of lights, brings with it a lot of happiness, but the problem of patients suffering from asthma, COPD or allergic rhinitis increases these days
 pataakhon main maujuud chote kan sehat par bura asar daalate hai, jiskaa asar fefdon par padataa he
 In this way, the smoke from firecrackers can cause inflammation in the lungs, due to which the lungs are not able to do their work properly and the conditions can even reach that organ failure and death can occur
 aise main dhuen se bachane kii koshish karen
 Dr
 agarwal kehete hai ki pataakhon ke dhuen kii vajah se asthma yaa dama kaa atake aa saktaa he
 This can happen when harmful toxic particles reach the lungs, which can also cause life risk to the person
 aise main jin logon ko saans kii samasyaayein hon, unhen apane aap ko pradooshit hawa se bachaa kar rakhana chahie
 Fireworks smoke can also cause a risk of heart attack and stroke
 pataakhon main maujuud lead sehat ke liye khatarnaak he, iske kaaran harntac or stroke kii ashanka bad jaati he
 When the smoke emanating from the firecrackers enters the body with breath, the flow of blood starts to stop
 dimag ko paryaapt maatra main khun na pahunchane ke kaaran vyakti stroke kaa shikaar ho saktaa he
 Dr
 gyanendra agarwal kehete hai ki bachche or garbhvatee mahilaon ko pataakhon ke shor va dhuen se bachakar rahanaa chahie
 Concentrated smoke from firecrackers causes respiratory problems, especially in young children
 pataakhon main hanikar rasayan hote hai, jinke kaaran bacchon ke sharir main toxins kaa str bad jaataa he or unke vikaas main rukaawat paidaa karata he
 Smoke of firecrackers also increases the chances of miscarriage, so pregnant women should also stay at home at such times
 dow
 Agarwal says that radioactive and toxic substances are used to make crackers colorful
 ye padaarth jahaan ek ore hawa ko pradooshit karte hai, vahiin duusari ore inase cancer kii ashanka bhi rahati he
 He said that the smoke increases the PM in the air during Diwali
 jab log in pradooshkon ke sampark main aate hai to unhen aankh, naak or gale kii samasyaayein ho sakati hai
 Fireworks smoke, colds can cause colds and allergies and can also cause congestion in the chest and throat
 yah puche jane par ki pataakhon ke jalane se kis tarah kii gaisen paidaa hoti hai? dow
 Agarwal said that during Diwali fire pollution increases due to firecrackers
 dhul ke kanon par copper, zinc, sodium, lead, magnesium, cadmium, sulfur oxide or nitrogen oxide jamaa ho jate hai
 These gases have harmful effects
 isamen copper se saans kii samasyaayein, cadmium-khun kii oxigen le jane kii kshamta kam karata he, jisase vyakti anemia kaa shikaar ho saktaa he
 Vomiting and fever and lead to zinc cause damage to the nervous system
 magnesium va sodium bhi sehat ke liye hanikaarak he
 What precautions should be taken by ill people regarding firecrackers and pollution during Diwali? Dr
 agarwal kehete hai ki chote bacchon, bujurgon or biimaar logon ko apane aap ko bachaa kar rakhana chahie
 Heart patients should also avoid firecrackers
 inke fefden bahut najuk hote hai
 Many times the elderly and sick people become a victim of heart attack due to the noise of firecrackers
 kuch log to shock lagane ke kaaran mar bhi sakate hai
 Small children, innocent animals and birds are also frightened by the loud sound of firecrackers
 pataakhe biimaar logon, bacchon or varisht nagarikon ke liye khatarnaak hai
 Asked if firecrackers also produce sound and smoke? They cause noise pollution, what should be done to avoid this? On this, Aggarwal says that noise has a bad effect on human health
 shor yaa aawaaj hawa se failati he
 It is measured in decibels
 visheshgyon kaa kahana he ki 100 decible se zyada aawaaj kaa bura asar hamaari sunne kii kshamta par padataa he
 According to the World Health Organization, a sound of 45 decibels is favorable for cities
 lekin bharat ke bade shaharon main shor kaa str 90 decible se bhi adhik he
 The appropriate level for humans is considered to be up to 85 decibels
 anchaahi aawaaj manushya par manovaigyanik asar paidaa karti he
 He said that noise can cause stress, depression, high blood pressure, hearing loss, tinnitus, sleep disturbances etc
 tanaav or ucch raktchaap sehat ke liye ghaatak he, vahiin tinnitos ke kaaran vyakti kii yaaddaasht ja sakati he, vah avsaad / depressant kaa shikaar ho saktaa he
 Too much noise is not good for heart health
 shor main rahane se raktchaap paanch se das guna bad jaataa he or tanaav badhata he
 All these factors can cause hypertension and coronary artery diseases
 aise main diwali ke dauraan pataakhon va pradooshan se bachane ke liye kya saavdhaaniyaan baraten? is sawaal par dow
 Aggarwal said that try not to burn firecrackers or fire less firecrackers
 pataakhon ke jalane se carbon dioxide, carbon monooxide or sulfur oxide jaisi gaisen nikalati hai jo dama ke marijon ke liye khatarnaak hai
 Existing smoke in the air can be fatal to children and the elderly
 unhone salaah di ki pradooshit hawa se bachein, kyonki yah tanaav or allergy kaa kaaran ban sakati he
 Cover your mouth with a handkerchief or cloth to avoid allergies
 dama aadi ke marij apana inheler apane saath rakhen
 If you have trouble breathing, use it immediately and after this consult a doctor

 Gulshan Kumar of t series used to say that this song is throat to heart

 Recently, Anil Kapoor approached me for "badan Pe Stars" for Fanney Khan, so i told him, i don't like such songs anymore

 "why are not good songs being made"? We jokingly wish we were born in Pakistan
 main kah rahaa hum pataa kar lijie usamen tathy he
 This is why music is not coming according to you and remixes are coming on remixes

 It happens
 maine apane aap ko paaya, isliye meri yatra behatar rahi
 "why are remixes being made?" Sometimes it would have been better if we were from Pakistan
 kyonki hamen bharat main kaam mil rahaa hota
 Now it has happened that singers have to pay money to music companies for their shows
 yadi aap unhen paise nahin dete hai to ve aapkaa gaanaa bajaaenge hi nahin
 Those songs will not get you done
 wo ye karenge ki apane singrs ko gaanaa dilavaayenge or phir us singer ko bada karenge or phir usase paise lenge gane ke
 "" They don't do this with Pakistani singers
 ye acchhee baat he ki wo unke saath aisa nahin karte
 But if that's the case then why are you doing the same with Indian singers? Atif Aslam is my good friend
 aap usko nahin bolte ki shoj ke liye mujhe paise do
 Relief is not said that let us sing and give money to us
 ye dhandha hi ulataa ho gaya he
 You ask me how much is true in the industry that i am saying
 yahi kaaran he ki nae gane aa hi nahin rahe hai
 And remixes are coming on remixes
 pehle nirdeshak, nirmaataa, gayak sangeet banaate the
 These days music companies are making music
 aapkaa kaam aapako aata he
 You can improve it
 main aapako kya gyaan duun isamen
 "ajan is closed, now sleeps" Do not say Ajan, it is not about Ajan but loudspeaker

 Modi said that apology will not serve any purpose as it is not the right way to deal with such allegations
 modi se godhra cond ke baad hue dangon ke liye maafee maangane ke bare main poocha gaya tha jisamen 1000 se adhik log maare gaye the
 Modi said, 'I am sure that if there is even a truth in these allegations, then i feel that Modi should be hanged at the crossroads for India's bright future and tradition
 sajaa aisi honi chahie ki aane vaale 100 baras main kisi ko aisa aparaadh karne kaa saahas na ho
 'it hurts even if the ant dies,' Modi said in an interview broadcast on ANI, 'if i have committed a crime, Modi should not be forgiven
 maafee maangane ke baad logon ko maaf karnaa, yah kya vyavastha he? maafee nahin maangani chahie
 Modi should never be forgiven
 ’ unhone kaha ki agar vah saal 2002 yaa 2007 kaa chunaav haar gaye hote to maafee maangane kii baat uthati hi nahin
 There is a small circle which thinks that they have created a storm by working hard

 It is his passion to make Modi fall

 He said that his remarks were not misinterpreted as he intended
 kuch varsh pehle sadbhaavna upwas ke dauraan gol topi pahanane se inkaar karne ke bare main puche jane par modi ne kaha ki vah apni parampara kaa paalan karte hai or dusron kii paramparaon kaa sammaan karte hai
 If the round cap will be hoisted, then not the bjp's prime ministerial candidate said, 'I am against the policy of appeasement
 main tushtikaran ke kisi pratik ko kabhi nahin apanaaunga, lekin agar koi gol topi uchhaalega tab main ise bardaasht nahin karuunga
 Such punishment should be given which is precedent
 ’ mukademon kaa saamana karne vaale vidhayakon evam saansadon ko jail main daalane se sambandhit unki haal kii tippanee ke bare main puche jane par narendra modi ne kaha ki raajnneeti kaa apradheekaran gambhir mudda he
 He said that if he comes to power, for such mlas and mps against whom criminal cases are pending, he will urge the Supreme Court to set up a special court and pronounce the verdict in a year
 modi ne kaha ki jo log doshi qaraar diye jate hai, unki seat khaali ho jaaegi or unka sthaan bina aapraadhik aaropon kaa saamana karne vaale logon se bharaa jaayegaa
 The BJP leader said, 'everyone says this but no one does

 PM Modi's Kisan Rally in Bengal Today 12: 11 AM FIFA World CUP: Harry Kane Wins Golden Boot Award 12: 09 AM France Wins FIFA Football World Cup, Croatia 4-2 devbhumi uttarakhand main chaar dham yatra kii shuruyaat hue lagbhag ek maheenaa biit chukaa he
 This time a large number of devotees are taking part in the Char Dham Yatra
 lekin ek maheene main hi is yatra main aae 44 shraddhaluon kii maut ho chuki he
 With 44 deaths in the first month, questions are being raised on the Department of Health, which has been able to provide better health facilities
 is baar ricard tod sankhya main yatri chardhaam aa rahe hai, jisamen sabase zyada badrinaath or kedarnath kii ore rukh kar rahe hai
 Usually Badrinath used to have a high number of travelers, but this time a large number of people have come to Kedarnath
 jahaan badrinaath main ek maheene main paanch lakh se zyada shraddhalu pahunche hai, vahiin kedarnath main bhi is baar yah aankada lagbhag baraabar hi he
 Before the commencement of the yatra, the Health Department had talked about providing better health facilities for the passengers, but at the beginning of the yatra, 44 people from far off places have died
 is maamle main jab swasthya mahanideshak uttarakhand se poocha gaya to unka kahana he ki yatra main kisi prakaar kii koi asuvidha na ho iske liye sarkaar ke dwaara behatar prabandh kiye gaye hai
 Besides, health facilities are also being provided to the passengers
 swasthya mahanideshak dow ravindra thapalial kii maane to ab tak 71 hajaar logon ko health post main upachaar bhi diya ja chukaa he
 Nurses and doctors are deployed for the treatment of people and are doing their duty
 yatriyon kii ho rahi lagaataar mauton se swasthya vibhaag kii vyavasthaaon par sawaal uthne laazmi hai
 However, according to the Director General of Health on this matter, out of 44 devotees killed, about 27 have died due to heart attack and others have died due to different reasons
 magar kahin na kahin oonchai par oxsigen kii kami ek badi vajah he
 The figure of 44 deaths in the first month of devotees who came to visit the Chardham Yatra of Devbhoomi Uttarakhand is shocking
 swasth vibhaag kii ye ahm jimmedaari banati he ki wo behatar suvidhaayen den or samay se ilaaj uplabdh kara saken
 But the statistics of death are telling something else
 pradhanmantri manmohan singh se jab mantrimandal vistaar ke bare main sawaal poocha gaya, to unhone is baar bhi purana jawaab hi diya
 a reporter from Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who was returning to attend the G20 summit meeting in Toronto, sought to know about the plans for cabinet expansion in view of the monsoon session coming closer to Parliament
 iske jawaab main singh ne kaha, ‘‘jahaan tak monsoon satr or cabinet pherbadal kii baat he, mujhe lagata he ki yah press conference mantrimandal main pherbadal kii ghoshnaa karne kaa uchit sthaan nahin he
 You will know whenever this is done
 ’’ singh hameshaa hi cabinet main pherbadal sambandhi sawaalon ke jawaab taalte rahe hai
 The Aam Aadmi Party has accused Delhi Congress state president Ajay Maken of allegations of irregularities in the CCTV tender
 dilli sarkaar dwaara sisitivi kii tender prakriya par safai dete hue aam aadmi party (aap) ke netaaon ne daawa kiya ki jald hi sarkaar cabinet ke saamne shahar main sisitivi lagane kii jaankaree rakhegi
 Aam Aadmi Party's Delhi convenor and minister Gopal Rai said that Ajay Maken has lied about CCTV
 sisitivi tender prakriya ke bare main gopal raay ne vistrut jaankaree di
 He said that there are two types of tenders, the rate contract tender and the second project contract tender
 rate contract tender main ek camere kii laagat kaa anumaan lagaaya jaataa he
 As the number of cameras increases, the total cost also increases
 dilli sarkaar jo camere lagane ja rahi he wo rate contract tender ke tahat hai
 Gopal Rai further said that, as far as the easing of the terms is concerned, let me tell you that when the tender was withdrawn for the first time, two companies applied
 zyada nipun (expert) companiyaan isamen aavedan den, ye sochakar dobaaraa tender nikaala gaya tha
 But for the second time also only those two companies applied
 un do companiyon main se ek privet company thi or duusari centre sarkaar kii bharat electronics limited company thi
 Since the estimated cost of the government company was lower than the estimated cost of the private company, we chose Bharat Electronics Ltd
 of the central government
 unhone kaha ki main ajay maakan ji se poochna chahta hum ki jab abhi kaam shuru hi nahin hua to ghotaalaa kahaan or kaise hua?iske saath hi gopal raay nijay makanse 5 sawaal bhi puche-1
 Why is Ajay Maken involved in the conspiracy to stop CCTV cameras? 2
 tathakthith ghotaale ke naam par mohalla clinics kaa kaam rukvakar ajay maakan ko kya phayda hua?3
 Why did Ajay Maken lie to the Cabinet not to approve? 4
 15 saal kii sarkaar main congress ne kitne CCTV camere lagaae?5
 The Nirbhaya case took place in Ajay Maken's parliamentary constituency New Delhi
 saansad rahete hue mahila suraksha ke liye ajay maakan ne kya kiya? us samay centre or dilli, donon hi jagah congress kii sarkaar thi
 Gopal Rai alleged that the BJP is taking revenge for its defeat with the people of Delhi
 up-rajyapal centre ke ishaare par dilli sarkaar ke sabhi kaamon main adnga lagaate rahe hai
 But why is Delhi Congress state president Ajay Maken always obstructing the interests of the people of Delhi
 ye baat aaj tak samaj nahin ai
 Has Ajay Maken ji prepared for joining BJP? kapil dev kii aguwai vaali bhartiya team 1983 main jab vishwa champion bani thi to use keval 20 hajaar pound kii inami raashi mili thi lekin yadi 2011 main mahendra singh dhoni kii timvishv kapavijeta banati he to use isse lagbhag 90 guna adhik puraskaar raashi milegi
 The International Cricket Council has kept the prize money for Cricket Mahakumbh running in India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh from 19 February to 2 April, almost double the previous World Cup
 is toornament main champion banane vaali team ko 30 lakh dollars(lagbhag 18 lakh 74 hajaar pound yaa 13 karod 67 lakh rupee) kii inami raashi milegi
 Alam is that this time the team winning the first round will also get 60 thousand dollars (about 27 lakh rupees), which is more than the prize money (30 thousand pounds) given to the Australian team, which became the first champion in 1987
 is baar jo bhi team quarter final main pahonchegi, usko teen lakh 70 hajaar dollars (lagbhag ek karod 68 lakh rupee) milane tay hai
 In the same way, the team that lost in the semi-finals would get $ 750,000, or Rs
 41 million, and the team that lost in the final would get $ 1
50 million, or Rs
 63
83 million, which is the biggest prize money as compared to all the previous World Cups
 is
 lekin saurav ganguli kii team ko 2003 main keval up vijeta banane par hi aath lakh dollars mil gayi the jabaki champion austrailia ko 20 lakh dollars mili the
 Four years later, this amount was increased to 22 lakh 40 thousand dollars in the World Cup held in the West Indies
 riki ponting kii team pichhali baar bhi champion bani thi jabaki up vijeta rahi srilankai team ko das lakh dollars mili the
 When the Indian team became champions in 1983, the cricket board also did not have money to give to the players
 aakhir main paisa ikattha karne ke liye lata mangeshkar kaa cancert karavaaya gaya tha jisase champion team ke prayek khilaadi ko ek-ek lakh rupee mil gaya tha
 Now if Dhoni's team becomes champion, then each of its members is sure to get crores of rupees
 guzarat main jald hi uski pehali saura vedhashala or nakshatra vedhashala banane ja rahi hai
 Government recognized Indian Planetary Society (IPS) has selected Kutch district for this project costing around Rs 12 crore
 ipies ke siio akshay malhotra ne bataaya ki saura vedhashala kaa upyog surya tathaa saura pranali ke adhyayan ke liye kiya jayega jabaki nakshatra vedhashala vibhinn akaash gangaaon, grahon or taron kaa adhyayan kar suchanaaen ekatra karegi

 unhone bataaya ki pehali baar ipies pehali saura or nakshatra vedhashalaon kii sthapana karne ke liye kisi pariyojna se judaa he
 We have decided to set up these observatories in Kutch as the sky is very clear
 sateek parinaamon ke liye aasmaan kaa saaf hona bahut jaruri he
 Malhotra said that there are such observatories in different parts of India, which are operated by the government, but we are an independent NGO recognized by the government

 He told that it is very important to clear the sky at night to observe the galaxies
 tippaniyan He said that the budget for the solar observatory is about two crore rupees while we may need at least Rs 10 crore for the constellation observatory
 pariyojna ke liye ham pipipi model apanaayenge or ise puraa hone main kuch saal lagenge
 Apart from this, we will also request grants and funds from the government
 kuccha main sambhavit jagah kaa vyapak adhyayan karne ke liye malhotra in dinon vahiin hai
 He informed that for the first time IPS is associated with a project to establish the first solar and constellation observatories
 hamane kuccha main aasmaan bahut saaf hone kii vajah se ye vedhashalaayein vahaan sthapit karne kaa nirnay kiya he
 Clear sky is very important for accurate results
 malhotra ne bataaya ne ki bharat ke vibhinn hisson main aisi vedhashalaayein hai, jinka sanchaalan sarkaar kar rahi he, lekin ham ek swatantra gaiyr sarkari sanghathan hai jise sarkaar ne manyata di he
 For the first time such observatories are being established in Gujarat
 unhone bataaya ki raat ko akashgangaon ke nirikshan ke liye aasmaan saaf hona bahut jaruri he
 The comments unhone bataaya ki saura vedhashala ke liye bajet kareeb do karod rupee he jabaki hamen nakshatra vedhashala ke liye kam se kam 10 karod rupee kii jarurat pad sakati he
 We will adopt the PPP model for the project and it will take a few years to complete
 iske alaava ham anudaan or sarkaar se bhi kosh kaa aagrah karenge

 rouj avenue court ne chrishchiyan mishael kii arji par sunwaayee karte hue buudhvaar ko sibiai or idi ko notice jari kar jawaab daakhil karne ko kaha he

 chunaav jeetne ke baad gahalot sarkaar ne ko-oparative bainkon ke kisaanon ke karj maaf karne kii ghoshnaa kar di, lekin bainkon ko dene ke liye sarkaar ke paas paise nahin he
 Hence, farmers are not getting new loans due to lack of money with banks
 fasalon kii buaai khatm ho gai magar sarkaar paise jutaney ke liye bhagdaud main lagi he
 District collectors have even said that if the government does not arrange loans for farmers, law and order problems may arise
 jaipur jile ke phaagi ke ko-oparative sosayadi main kisaan lone ke liye chakkar kaat rahe hai, lekin kisaanon ko lone nahin mil paa rahaa he
 The co-operative banks have no money left to distribute to the farmers
 jowar, bajra, mung or dalhan kii fasalon kii buaai ke liye kisaan ko paise chahie hote hai, magar do maheene baad bhi sarkaar paise nahin juta saki he
 600 crore loans were to be given in Jaipur district, but the government has been able to mobilize only 232 crore
 kisaanon main ise lekar baari naaraazgi he
 Fiji's farmer Brijmohan Sharma said that he had applied for 50 thousand loan for seed manure for planting moong but could not get it
 vahiin, kisaan govind narayan kaa kahana he ki mere 20 hajaar lone maaf hue the magar is baar to nahin mila he, kehete hai ki upar se hi paise nahin aayaa tha
 5 thousand crores was to be given to the farmers in this season
 The Rajasthan government wanted Rs
 5 thousand crores to give to the farmers for this season's crop, but even after taking loans from all the institutions after two months, it did not raise more than 2 thousand crores
 Pie
 darasal, rahul gandhi ne ghoshnaa kii thi ki sarkaar banane ke baad 10 din ke andar kisaanon kii karj maafee nahin hui to mukhyamantri badal denge
 In view of this, the Rajasthan government announced loan waiver of 83 thousand crore farmers of cooperative banks but nothing was given to the cooperative banks
 phaagi ko-oparative bank ke adhyaksh om sharma kaa kahana he ki sarkaar ne bina soche samajhe lone maaf kar die or ko-oparative bainkon ko paisa mila nahin
 Even if 200 crore came from NABARD, the Central Co-operative Bank put 100 crore part of its loan waiver before it
 bikaner main 372
 54 crores out of 5 crores, 536 in Ajmer
 44 main se 75 karod, bharatpur main 451

 Whereas now the crop has come to be ready
 2 lakh tak kisaanon ke lone hue the maafcongress ke purv adhyaksh rahul gandhi kii karj maafee kii muhim ko dekhte hue vasundhara raaje ne chunaav ke pehle ko-oparative sosayadi ke 50 hajaar tak ke kisaanon ke lone maaf kar die the
 The Congress government, after coming to power, waived loans of up to 2 lakh farmers to keep the promise of Rahul Gandhi
 ab sarkaar kah rahi he ki ham koshish kar rahe hai or vipaksh kah rahi he ki kisaanon ko samay par lone nahin mil paa rahaa he
 The government is saying that we have taken a loan of 2600 crores to give to the farmers, now it is being distributed
 udhar nijee or sarkari bainko ne kisaanon ke lone maaf karne se ye kehete hue manaa kar diya he ki rajya sarkaar pehle kisaanon ke paise chukaaye tabhi ham kisaanon ke lone maaf karenge
 When we asked the chairman of SBI, we made it clear that waiving farmers loans is not a solution
 jaipur aae esbiai ke chairman rajnish kumaar ne kaha ki saxysive sarkarein aati hai or lone maaf kar detii he
 Now the time has come for us to consider whether this scheme is giving benefit to the farmers or not
 jila colectoron ne sarkaar se kaha he ki kisaanon ke lone kii jaldi vyavastha kii jaae varanaa kanoon-vyavastha kii samasya ho aa jaaegi
 The problem has become that in view of the government's announcement of loan waiver, the government and private banks are not able to give loans to farmers and the co-operative bank does not have enough money to distribute the loan
 is sabake bich kisaan kah rahe hai ki isse acha to lonmaphi ke pehle hi tha
 The festival of Diwali is being celebrated in the capital of the country very beautifully
 'ajtak' kii team ne aise parivaar se baatcheet kii jinhone is diwali pataakhon ko puri tarah na kah diya he
 Interestingly, these families and their neighbors used to fire heavily during the last few years on Diwali night, but this family has taken a pledge against the increasing pollution and poisonous air
 aathvin class main padhane vaali devi bataati hai ki diwali se pehle skool main nukkad naatak ke jariye jaagruk kiya gaya ki pataakhe se nikalne vaala pradooshan sehat ke liye kitna khatarnaak he
 Noise pollution from firecrackers is also enough, so parents are forbidden to buy firecrackers this year
 devi ne dilliwaalon se apil karte hue kaha ki diwali pataakhon kaa nahin balki deeyon kaa tyohaar he
 In such a situation, people should welcome Roshni to life and bid farewell to the wrong practice of bursting firecrackers
 is muhim main devi ko parivaar kaa saath mila he
 Devi's mother Meghna said that with increasing pollution, awareness in her family has increased significantly
 meghna aas-pados main pataakhe na jalane se behad khush hai
 He said that 'till 2 years ago our family and neighbors used to burst a lot of firecrackers but now the pollution is so much that it is difficult to breathe
 khushi kii baat he ki hamaari colony main ab pataakhen nahin phodte balki diye jalaae jate hai
 Nargis, who lives in Devi's neighborhood, says that firecrackers have been banned completely at home
 nargis ne badhate pradooshan par chintaa jataate hue kaha ki 'pichley saal diwali ke baad pradooshan itnaa zyada tha ki saamne vaali imaarat najar nahin aa rahi thi
 This year we have refused to buy firecrackers at home, that there is a dog in their house who is scared to hear the sound of firecrackers
 'haalanki jab parivaar or padosiyon se poocha gaya ki pataakhon ke bina wo diwali kaise manaayenge to kaaphi dilachasp jawaab mili
 Family members said that Diwali is a festival of firecrackers
 ek duusare se milane kaa tyohaar he, mithaas failaane kaa tyohaar he, naa kii pradooshan failaane kaa
 In such a situation, instead of bursting firecrackers, they will celebrate the festival of Diwali by spending time with family, making Rangoli
 aapako bataa den ki dilli main har saal sardiyon ke mausam main pradooshan kaa str achaanak bad jaataa he
 Also, due to firecrackers burning during Diwali, the air becomes poisonous many times
 aise main supreme court ne raat 8 baje se 10 baje tak green pataakhe phodne kii anumati di he
 However, in view of the increasing pollution, people are now shying away from firecrackers
 'khataron ke khilaadi'ke episods main jaisaa najar aata he, waisi gambhirtha or dar hameshaa set par nahin bana rahata
 Celebrities who often take part on the set also have fun with their host, film director Rohit Shetke

 jab rohit unke saath masti nahin kar rahe hote hai to vah unke pranks kaa khub majaa lete hai
 By the way, Rohit Shetty's pranks are quite famous in the entire film industry
