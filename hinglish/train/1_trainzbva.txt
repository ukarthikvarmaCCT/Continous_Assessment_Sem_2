 bataa den, banda main bal kunwar patel ko samaajawaadee party ke ummidavaar shyama charan gupta se muqabla karnaa hoga
 Shyama Charan Gupta, BJP MP from Prayagraj Lok Sabha seat of Uttar Pradesh, recently joined the Samajwadi Party
 iske baad samaajawaadee party ne unhen banda se apana ummidavaar ghoshit kar diya
 Let me tell you, Gupta contested the 2014 elections on BJP ticket and was elected Lok Sabha MP from Prayagraj
 2004 main vah sapa ke tikat par banda se chunaav jeet chuke hai
 It is said that Gupta feared ticketing by BJP this time, so he decided to go to SP
 is bich bhaajapa ke pradesh adhyaksh mahendra nath pandeya ne kaha tha ki gupta ko ahsaas tha ki unke karmon se is baar unhen bhaajapa se tikat nahin milegaa isliye unhone apana nayaa thikaana talash liyaayagupta, jo ek bade kaarobaari hai, 2009 kaa chunaav sapa ke tikat par phulpur se lade the lekin unhen paraajay kaa saamana karnaa pada tha
 Under the agreement with BSP, SP has got 37 seats while BSP will contest 38 seats
 teen siten ralod ko di gayi hai jabaki gathbandhan ne sonia gandhi ke nirvachan kshetra raibareli or rahul gandhi ke kshetra amethi se ummidavaar nahin utaarne kaa faisla kiya he
 Uttar Pradesh, which has 80 Lok Sabha seats, will go to polls in all phases of the election that starts on April 11
 VIDEO- bijepi saansad shyamacharan gupta ko sapa ne banda se diya tikat Janata Dal (united) President Sharad Yadav on Friday, accused of extravagance in the name of organizing the Commonwealth Games, and said that there is a need to maintain full transparency and transparency in the money being spent on organizing these games
 yadav ne kaha ki jab 2003 main rashtramandal khelon kii mejabani dilli ko saunpi gai thi to us samay in khelon ke aayojan par 1100 karod rupee ke anumaanit bajet kii baat kahi gayi thi jiske ab badhakar kareeb 13 hajaar karod rupee tak pahunch jane kii sambhaavna he
 These do not include the expenditure incurred on repairs in the national capital and adjoining areas from the budget of Delhi government
 unhone khelon ke aayojan par kharch kiye ja rahe dhan par puri nigaraanee rakhane or javabdehi nirdhaarit karne par jor diya or saath hi rashtramandal khelon ke aayojan par ab tak hue kharche kaa audit kisi swatantra agency se karaane kii maang kii
 The JDU leader said that since there is criticism about the expenditure on the Commonwealth Games, the common man would like to know the expenditure account, so the expenditure so far should be audited by an independent agency because this country is without any accountability to the taxpayers
 Can not tolerate the flow of money like water
 jadyu netaa sharad yadav ne kaha ki rashtramandal khelon ke naam par jitani raashi kharch kii ja rahi he utana paisa desh main khelon ke vikaas ke liye ab tak khel mantralay ko kabhi uplabdh nahin karaayaa gaya
 He said that it is right that the infrastructure for sports should be developed in our country and an atmosphere should be created among the youth about sports in the country
 unhone kaha ki agar rashtramandal khelon kii taiyaariyaan samay par puri ho jaati to isse kaaphi paison kii bachat hoti
 Yadav welcomed the decision of the Delhi High Court to place the Commonwealth Games 2010 Organizing Committee and the Indian Olympic Association under the Right to Information Act (RTI)
 unhone aayojan samiti kii swaittata kii daleel ko betuka batate hue kaha ki jab paisa sarkaar kaa he to niyantran sarkaar kaa hona chahie or janata ko is bare main jaanane kaa puraa adhikaar rahanaa chahie
 It is noteworthy that the Delhi High Court gave this decision on Thursday on the petition of the Organizing Committee, which challenged the government's decision to bring it under the purview of this transparent law
 rashtramandal khelon kii aayojan samiti or centre sarkaar main us samay than gai thi jab samiti ne soochna ke adhikaar adhinium ke tahat use suchnaayen saarvajanik karne ke liye uttaradaayi qaraar dene ke sarkaar ke faisle ko chunauti di thi
 The committee argued that since it is an independent and autonomous entity, it does not come under the purview of the RTI Act
 paabandiyon ke chalate chaatro kii upasthiti behad kam rahighati main do maheene se zyada samay se paabandiyaan chal rahi hanjammu-kashmir sarkaar ne buudhvaar se sabhi college, vishvavidhyalay or ucch shiksha sansthaanon ko kholane kaa aadesh diya he
 The schools were already opened
 haalanki, kashmir ghati main do maheene se zyada samay se chal rahi paabandiyon ke chalate skool or vishvavidhyalayon main chaatro kii upasthiti philhal behad kam rah rahi he
 Ruban, a student of bcom in Srinagar told, “I am a student of bcom
 samasya yah he ki maahaul thik nahin he
 The means of communication are not working, the transport services are at a standstill
 abhibhavak bhi bacchon ko baahar bhejne se dar rahe hai
 "ruban is not the only one who feels that way
 srinagar ke espi college pahunche kuch or chaatro ne bataaya ki maahaul thik nahin he
 a student outside SP College said, “we came here to take stock of the situation
 andar bahut se ardhsainik bal ke jawan maujuud hai
 In such a situation, nobody will feel like going inside
 aisa lag rahaa he ki is vakt college kaa istemaal suraksha balon ke liye kiya ja rahaa he or aage bhi kiya jaataa rahegaa
 We are definitely worried about our future as the exams are coming closer, but our parents are also scared
 ”ek or chaatr akibamotorcycle se pahunche the
 He said that he has come to see what is the news about his annual examination
 akeeb kaa kahana he, “aaj yahaan mushkil se koi chaatr dikh rahaa he
 Most people are worried about what is going on
 koi mobile network kaam nahin kar rahaa he
 Public transport facilities are also very limited
 ” iske pehle sarkaar ne skulon ko kholane kaa aadesh diya tha lekin badi sankhya main chaatr nadaarad rahe
 The parents say that the atmosphere is not normal and the Kashmiri people have not yet come out of shock
 ek abhibhavak alimohammad ne kaha, “sabase pehali baat to jo kuch hua usase kashmiri khush nahin hai
 The government should not have done this (removal of Article 370)
 agar dimagi shanti nahin he to skool college kya karenge? jahaan tak chaatro kii baat he to koi bhi mata pita kisi tarah kaa khatra uthaane ko taiyaar nahin hai
 "significantly, on August 5, the central government had taken a major decision and neutralized Article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir and divided the state into two union territories
 uske baad se ghati main halaat tanaavpurn bane hue hai

 When there will be no beds in the hospitals, how can anyone get the benefit of Ayushman Bharat Scheme? But the misfortune is that the pace of infrastructure development of the health sector is very slow, that is why the plunder of the private sector continues on the health front
 duusari baar bani modi sarkaar kii nai vitt mantri nirmala sitaraman se ummid he ki bajet main vah is morche par kuch kargar kadam uthaaengi
 The health sector's health worsens according to the National Health Profile 2018, with 7,10,761 beds in about 23,582 government hospitals in the country
 desh main har kareeb 10 hajaar logon par sirf ek allopathic doctor uplabdh he
 Of this, only 10 percent are employed in government hospitals
 is tarah har 2000 logon par sarkari aspataal kaa sirf ek bed he
 In a population of more than 125 crores, this capacity is same as cumin in the camel's mouth
 desh main philhal kareeb 476 medical college or 562 dental college hai
 About 87,000 students study in them
 isi tarah har saal 1
 30 lakh general nurses study in midwife nursing institutes and 46,795 student pharmacy colleges
 desh kii kareeb 70 karod jansankhya gramin ilaakon main rahati he, lekin unki swasthya jaruraton ko puraa karne ke liye sirf 1
 There are 56 lakh health sub-centers, around 26 thousand primary health centers and 5,624 community health centers (as of 31st March 2017)
 is tarah gramin ilaakon main doctoron or aspataalon kii baari kami he
 According to a report by the World Health Organization, 75 percent of the primary healthcare services in rural areas are dependent on the jhola print doctors
 gramin kshetron ke har paanch main se mahaj ek doctor medicine kii practice karne ke yogya he
 The WHO report has revealed a shocking disclosure of the problem of doctors
 saal 2016 main ai is report main kaha gaya he ki gaanvon main apane ko allopathic doctor bataane vaale logon main se 31
 4 percent have studied only up to 12th, while 57
 3 kathith doctoron ne kahin se medical shiksha nahin lee he
 The problem is not just this
 sarkari aspataalon main jo sajo-saamaan hai unka bhi istemaal nahin ho paa rahaa
 a report by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) has revealed that 27 of the clinical equipment in hospitals
 31 fisadi or non-clinical equipment kii 56
 There is a 33 per cent shortage, but it is also shocking that many important medical equipment are unable to be used for five to five years as their annual maintenance contract is not done
 is tarah, yah saaf he ki desh ke swasthya kshetra ko agar sarkaar sudhaarna chaahati he to iske buniyadi dhaancha vikaas ke liye usee tarah se kranti lani hogi, jaisaa ki sadakon ke maamle main modi sarkaar ne kiya he
 In the interim budget, Union Minister Piyush Goyal had announced to increase the health sector budget by about 16 per cent to Rs 61,398 crore, but about Rs 6,400 crore is about the Ayushman Bharat scheme
 ummid he ki is purna bajet main vitt mantri nirmala sitaraman desh ke healthcare sector kii sehat ko sudhaarney ke liye kuch bada kadam uthaaengi

 court ne unhen sarender karne ke liye chaar hafte kaa samay diya he
 The court refused to grant a six-month extension after hearing arguments from Sanjay Dutt
 gauratlab he kifilm industry ke278 karodsanjay dutt par lage hai
 Earlier, the Supreme Court on Tuesday dismissed the application of convict Jabunnisa Anwar Kazi in a 1993 Mumbai bomb blast case
 jabunnisa ne apni arji main sarender karne ke liye mohalat maangi thi
 Significantly, under the Arms Act, Jabunnisa has received a five-year sentence
 iske alaava ishahaak mohammad or shahrif abdul kii yachika ko bhi supreme court ne khaarij kar diya tha
 The Supreme Court on Tuesday heard the case on Tuesday at 10 am on the plea of actor Sanjay Dutt to extend the surrender period to six months in the 1993 Mumbai blasts case

 Justices p
 sadashivam kii adhyakshata vaali supreme court kii peeth ne is yachika kii sunwaayee karte hue maanviya aadhaar par yah faisla diya
 a few days ago, Sanjay Dutt, while publicly sobbing in the midst of tears, announced that he will no longer pray for forgiveness, he will reach jail on time
 lekin ab mohalat maangi he, 6 maheene kii taaki adhuri filmein puri kar saken
 He had argued that 7 of his films are incomplete, all together costing a loss of 278 crores
 munnabhai kaa role karke dubaara logon ke jehan main mahatma gandhi kii yaad taaja karaane vaale sanju baba ne apni yachika main kaha tha ki agar samay nahin diya gaya to saikadon mazdooron kii roji-roti par asar hoga
 Expressing unwavering faith in the law, he said that he did not sign any new film after the verdict
 jinaki filmein ataki hai wo bhi supreme court se sanjay dutt ke liye thodi raham kii guhaar laga rahe hai
 Filmmaker Apoorva Lakhia told, 'we have written a letter, in which they should be exempted till the work is over
 ’udhar, jabunnisa ne apni umr kaa hawala dete hue court se raahat kii guhaar lagaai thi
 Jabunnisa, 70, suffering from kidney cancer, is undergoing treatment
 jabunnisa ne apni yachika main kaha tha ki use naa keval lagaataar doctoron kii dekharekh main rahane kii jarurat he, balki hameshaa ek dekhbhaal karanevaala bhi chahie
 She had said that she would not survive while in jail in this condition
 sanjay dutt kii daleelon ke jawaab kuch vaazib sawaal bhi banate hai
 Those questions may be something like this: -is Sanjay Dutt doing the country a favor by making films? -was the employment of the people associated with the project permanent? -when it was known that the High Court has been punished, even the Supreme Court's decision Will come soon, then why sign new films? - If the softness is based on Munna then what should be strictly on the role of kancha-chyna, villains and other criminals? -sanjay Dutt's 7 films will not release Will the country suffer big losses? Some questions are being asked by law experts as well: Sanjay Dutt gets the same charges and the same punishment
 The plea of the three accused in the 1993 Mumbai blasts, Jabunnisha, Qazi and Abdul Gafoor, was given by the Supreme Court on Tuesday
 Was rejected

 film main gaanaa 'ruk ja o dil diwane
 
 
 At the end of it, Shahrukh slams Kajol to the ground
 dilachasp ye he ki kaajol ko iske bare main pataa hi nahin tha
 Actually, Aditya Chopra wanted to shoot Kajol's natural reaction
 isliye unhone kaajol ko yah baat bataai hi nahin
 Kajol had applied lipstick marks on Shahrukh's chest
 You will remember the scene when Shahrukh Khan removes his shirt and shows lipstick marks on his chest
 asal main seen ke shoot se pehle kaajol ne hi shahrukh ke seene par wo nishaan banaae the
 Many scenes had to be taken to shoot this scene because whenever Shahrukh Khan removed his shirt, Kajol would laugh
 24 baar riject hua tha gaanaa 'mere khwaabon main jo aae
 
 
 "who came in my dreams
" 
 
 gane kaa sangeet taiyaar karne main kalyaan-anand ke paseene chhot gaye the
 Aditya Chopra rejected the different tune for the entire 24 times
 ant main jo dhun final kii gai vah aaj bhi logon kii jubaan par he
 The song for the second film was shot 'mehndi Lagake Rekha
 
 
 'yah vahiin gaanaa tha jisase jariye farah khan kii yashraj camp main entry hui thi
 But this song was recorded for another film

 com / ayxpqavc9b— Andy Rexford (@andyrexford)february 27, 2015THE ILLUMINATI CONDUCTED THIS WHOLE DRESS SITUATION TO REPLACE OBAMA WITH a LIZARD WITHOUT BEING NOTICED # whiteandgold— STOP THE ILLUMINATI (@illuminati_stop)february 27, 2015 Senior BJP leader Gopinath Munde, who has adopted a rebellious tone, dismissed reports of leaving the party, alleging that some people of his party were spreading such rumors
 congress main shaamil hone kii atakalon ke bich munde ne vipaksh kii netaa sushamaa swaraj se unke awaas par mulaakaat ke baad samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘main bhaajapa main tha or bhaajapa main hum
 The news coming in this regard is incorrect
 ’maharashtra ke mukhyamantri prithviraj chavaan or sonia gandhi ke raajnneetik sachiv ahamed patel se mulaakaat ke bare main puche jane par unhone kaha, ‘bhaajapa ke sheersh netaaon ke saath chal rahi baatcheet ke dauraan unki maharashtra ke mukhyamantri yaa ahamed patel se kabhi bhi mulaakaat nahin kii
 Such reports are baseless
 ’party se apni or samarthak kaaryakartaaon kii pidaa kaa samaadhaan nikalne ke bare main puche jane par munde ne kaha, ‘maine kabhi apni pidaa saarvajanik nahin kii
 i have put it before the top leaders of the party and now they have to find a solution
 ’munde kii pidaa ke bare main puche jane par sushamaa swaraj ne kaha, ‘pidaa uchit sthaan par rakhi jaati hai, ise saarvajanik nahin kiya jaataa he
 Munde has put his suffering in a proper place
 iskaa samdhaan nikal aayegaa
 When asked about the news of leaving the party and joining the Congress, Sushma said, "such rumors are being spread to tarnish Munde's image
" munde ne swayan spasht kiya he ki is sambandh main aa rahi khabaren galat hai
 Before the 40-minute meeting with Sushma, Munde, the deputy leader of the party in the Lok Sabha, admitted that he had 'troubles' on many things and on all these he was in talks with senior party leaders including Sushma to find a solution
 
 vah party ke kuch anya varisht netaaon se bhi milenge
 In response to the questions, he also dismissed the discussions of joining the Congress or UPA government and called them mere rumors
 sushamaa ne kaha ki munde kii do din pehle party ke sheersh netaaon ke saath baithak ke dauraan vah dilli main nahin thim
 Munde urged him to meet and put his point before him

 ) During the election campaign, an SMS from BJP leader Ashwini Upadhyay used to repeatedly drink in my mobile - will make Delhi corruption free in 15 days and crime free within 3 months
 bhrashtachar ko lekar aam aadmi party ke vaade bhi kuch kam nahin hai
 Apart from this, you must have heard so many promises and claims in this election, which it seems that the parties have an alladin's lamp, which the CM will burn as soon as he sits on the chair
 haalanki is maamle main bijepi adhyaksh amit shah thodi safagoi dikhaate hue kah chuke hai ki bank account main 15 lakh rupee kaala dhan laane kaa modi kaa vaada to ek chunavi jumala tha
 So it is better that after the election, when the leaders tell you that their promises were electoral jumps, before you look at the reality - Nirbhaya cannot be saved cm-delhi's law and order and police are directly in the hands of the central government
 is maamle main dilli kaa mukhyamantri utana hi kar saktaa he, jitna koi bhi aam aadmi
 Whatever party is claiming to eradicate the crime is lying sixteen
 lekin partiyaan bhi kya karen dilli main mahilaon ke khilaaf aparaadh or anya aparaadh apane aap chunavi mudda ban jate hai aise main partiyaan in par daawey kiye bina nahin rah saktin
 So tie the knot that CM belongs to any party, Home Minister Rajnath Singh will be responsible for the crimes of Delhi, no Kejriwal, Kiran Bedi or Ajay Maken
 bijli ke vaade bhi hawaii hai-prachaar abhiyaan main pradhanmantri ne baar baar kaha ki bijli kii aisi vyavastha kii jaaegi ki aap jis chaahe company se bijli kaa conection lenge
 He told in easy terms that the electricity company can be changed as soon as the mobile operators can change
 yahaan aapako bataa den ki siddhantaroop main shila dikshit kii tatkaaleen sarkaar is vyavastha ko paarit kar chuki thi
 But electricity does not come from a mobile tower like a mobile signal, but from electrical wires
 iske alaava or bhi bahut si oparational majaburiyaan hai, jinke kaaran paanch saal pehle siddhant rup main sabake sahamat hone ke baavjood yah vyavastha lagu nahin ho pai
 And in this election campaign, no such basic thing was said in which to change these operational compulsions
 udhar aap aadmi party kii sasti bijli sirf sabsidi se aa paaegi
 At his instance, the power companies will not reduce the price in any case
 ulate agar sarkaar ne zyada koshish kii to ve dilli kii bijli supplai gadabada dengi, vaise bhi ek maheene baad garmiyaan aane vaali hai
 And if the government gave subsidy, where will the money come from? dilli sarkaar kaa nizaam centre kii madad se chalata he
 Obviously, if the Kejriwal government is formed, Modi is not going to pay money, at least for subsidy, buoyed by the defeat
 isliye bijli par zyada utsahit hone ke asaar nahin hai
 Haryana will not provide water - There was a Congress government in Delhi and the Center for the last 10 years, but Haryana did not provide additional water to Delhi
 agar haryana aisa karata he to vahaan ke mukhyamantri apane kisaanon ko kya jawaab denge
 That is why Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar remained completely silent on the water issue despite being present at the Prime Minister's rally on 10 January
 centre, emsidi or didie-upar bataaya ja chukaa he ki police centre ke paas he
 Apart from this, before placing a bill in the Delhi Assembly, it has to get the approval of the Center
 yah vyavastha anya kisi rajya main lagu nahin hoti, lekin aadha rajya hone ke kaaran dilli ke mukhyamantri ko har kaam bade darbar se poochkar karnaa hota he
 Last time the same screw was stuck with the Lokpal
 kejariwal centre kii anumati ke bina bill laae the or congress ne niyamon kaa hawala dekar uskaa samarthan nahin kiya tha
 That is, without a good relationship with the center, the leaf will not move in the assembly
 doosraa mudda he emsidi or baaki nagar nikaayon kaa
 Delhi's main roads and flyovers have been built so much in 15 years that now there is no place to build them
 coloniyon ke andar kii sadaken emsidi ke paas aati hai
 Cleanliness of the city is also with these bodies
 yani dilli kii chaudi sadakon se hatate hi galiyon or bastiyon kii duniya puri tarah siem ke haath se baahar he
 That is, do not question the Chief Minister about here either
 garibon ke liye makaan banane kaa mudda he to dilli kii jameenon par didie kaa kabja he
 Unless the DDA says yes, the Delhi government will not have room to build new ones
 takaraav nahin, rasta khojein siemto kya dilli kaa mukhyamantri kuch nahin kar saktaa
 It is not so, he can pay attention to education and health
 iske alaava dilli jal board ke paas pehle se maujuud pani ke behatar prabandhan par dhyaan de saktaa he
 He also has options to make the city beautiful
 lekin ye saare kaam vikaas ke hote hue bhi sansani yaa khabar banane vaale nahin hai
 In such a situation, it is better that the Chief Minister should work in his limited field of work instead of interfering with the work of the Center, the DDA or the body
 dilli kaa mukhyamantri jitani jaldi yah sweekaar kar legaa ki vah adhure rajya kaa adhuraa mukhyamantri he, utani jaldi vah dilliwaalon kii behatar seva kar paaegaa
 If he compared himself to other chief ministers, the Delhiites would continue to rub
 vaise bhi mukhyamantri kii kursi dilli main chale ghamaasan chunaav prachaar ke lihaaj se kuch zyada hi choti he
 India will send the statements of eyewitness witnesses of the Mumbai attacks to the Pakistan anti-terrorism Court as evidence
 vishesh sarkari vakil ujjwal nikam ne yah jaankaree di
 The evidence also included the magistrate's statement, stating that the court had approved the prosecution's appeal in which the prosecution sought certified copies of the statements
 ek yaa do din main kootnithik madhyam se in bayanon ko bataur saboot pakistan bhej diya jayega
 The eyewitness statement is accompanied by the testimony of the magistrate before whom Pakistani terrorist Mohammad Ajmal Kasab gave a confessional statement and admitted his alleged role in the attack on November 26 last year
 kasaab mumbai hamalon ke dauraan pakadaa gaya ekmaatr jivit aatankwaadi he
 Suryanikam, who is running in Pakistan against Lakhvi, said that apart from the statements, the details of the testimony of some foreign nationals and some items recovered from Taj, Oberoi hotels and Nariman House will also be sent to Pakistan
 aatankwaadiyon kaa hamalaa taj, obaroy hotalon or nariman house main hi hua tha
 The magistrate's statement is considered significant as he said in the lower court that Kasab had admitted before him that the conspiracy for the attack was hatched by lashkar-e-taiba operatives including Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi in pakistan
 lakhvi ke khilaaf pakistan kii adaalat main sunwaayee chal rahi he
 The testimony of FBI officials will also include testimony from FBI officials
 unhone nichali adaalat main kaha tha ki ghatana sthalon se baraamad mobile phonon kaa istemaal aatankwaadiyon ne hamale ke dauraan pakistan main maujuud apane aakaaon se baatcheet main kiya tha
 Officials of a foreign mobile company also testified through video conference in the court that the mobile phones used by the terrorists were imported from China to Pakistan
 nikam ke anusaar, aatankwaadiyon ke paas se baraamad saamaan main rabar kii nauka or khaadya saamagree aadi hai jin par ‘‘maid in pakistan’’ kaa label laga hua he
 These goods will also be sent to Pakistan to prove that the attack conspiracy was hatched in Pakistan and the terrorists came from Pakistan to India
 bharat pehle bhi de chukaa he sabootis maamle main bharat sarkaar purv main bhi pakistan ko saboot bhej chuki he
 This includes the confessional statement of Kasab and the chargesheet filed by the police in the court
 baharhaal, pakistan kii adaalat ne in sabooton ko lakhvi tathaa chah anya ke khilaaf aarope tay karne ke liye ‘‘aparyaapt’’ bataaya
 a hearing is going on in Pakistan court against all these
 nikam ne bataaya ki aatankwaad nirodhak adaalat main kasaab ke die gaye ikbaalia bayaan ko magistrate ne ‘‘svaichhik’’ bataaya he
 In such a case, the evidence against Kasab is not only strong but also "fair and credible"
 unhone kaha ki sabhi gavaahon ke bayaan abhiyojan paksh ke is daawey ko majboot karte hai ki hamale kaa shadyantr pakistan main rachaa gaya tha
 The magistrate's statement proves that Hafiz Saeed, the founder of lashkar-e-taiba, was also involved in this

 ’ In UP, the issue of trying to change the religion of some Muslim families by greed is constantly getting hot

 Asaduddin Owaisi said that action was not taken two days after the matter came to light
 unhone sapa pramukh mulaayam singh yadav kii ore ishaara karte hue kaha, 'agar aap or bijepi mili hue nahin hote, aap ection nahin lete aresas or bajrang dal ke khilaaf? aap nurakushti karnaa chhod dijie
 Owaisi said while speaking his voice and saying, 'I am as much as a Muslim Indian, as much as a Muslim
 na isai darenge, na musalmaan darenge
 You try a million, we are not going to convert religion
 mulk ko bachaana he, to apane jokaron ko roko, apane chamachon ko roko
 
 
 In response, Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu said that doing politics on the issue of conversion is wrong

 adarsh nagar police kaa kahana he ki sompaal bhaagane ke liye thane kii teesri yaa chauthi manzil se neeche kud gaya
 Due to which his knee was broken but then the question arises that when Sompal's knee was broken how did he reach Majlis Park metro station, 6 kilometers from the police station? The surprising thing is that Sompal jumped from above
 jameen par gira
 Both his knees were broken
 vah baahar chalaa gaya lekin thane main maujuud kisi bhi police vaale ko naa to koi aawaaj sunai di or naa hi uski bhanak lagi

 Sompal was found on the bank of Keelashkad in such a way that it looks like he was the victim of an accident, but in the investigation so far, the team of DIU has not found any such clue from Majlis Park metro station, which proved this accident
 Possible sompaal ke gharavaalon kaa kahana he ki police apana jhooth chhipaane ke liye kahaniyaan garh rahi he
 There is a direct allegation from the family that the police beat Sompal fiercely
 use bahut zyada chot lagi

 Much controversy has arisen over Rahul's not meeting the sarpanch from Hazare's village
 padhein: rahul se nahin mil paye ralegan ke sarpanchain dinon maun vrath kar rahe hajaare ne ek likhit bayaan main kaha he ki sarpanch or unki team ne ‘aatm sammaan’ ke liye yah faisla kiya he
 However, he also said that he has no personal feelings against anyone

 But he did not meet because he is said to have not taken the time to meet Rahul
 bhrashtachar ke khilaaf andolan chalaa rahe anna hajaare ne kaha ki unke sahyogiyon or sarpanch ne unase kaha ki ab ve log rahul se nahin milenge

 ’ rahul se mulaakaat kaa samay na milane se kshubdh dal ne dilli se waapas jane kaa faisla kiya or kaha ki ab unhen mulaakaat kaa samay mil bhi gaya to gaanv hi faisla karegaa ki congress netaa se milanaa chahie yaa nahin
 Congress' PT Thomas, however, apologized for this' communication gap 'which led to confusion
 bataaya jaataa he ki yah bahucharchit mulaakaat thomas ne hi tay kii thi
 Hazare said the sarpanch received a phone call from Thomas asking him to come to Delhi on 17 October
 agle din rahul se mulaakaat honi thi
 He said, 'they asked for my permission and i said yes
 ’pathare ne nai dilli main samvaadadaataaon se kaha tha, ‘rahul gandhi se 18 oktober ko subah nau baje mulaakaat kaa samay milane kii baat sun kar ham yahaan aae the
 We trusted the mp's point

 ’ pathare ne kaha tha, ‘rahul se mulaakaat ke liye samay maangane sambandhi patr main hamane kaha tha ki jaisaa ki saansad ne kaha he, ham unase milanaa chaahate hai
 Thomas' office contacted us several times
 yahaan tak ki rahul gandhi ke karyaalay ne sarpanch se kai baar sampark kiya tha
 Photo: rahul-priyankamapari, who became 'common' among the public, said that the party from Ralegansiddhi village was humiliated and would no longer meet Rahul
 hajaare ne kaha, ‘jab sarpanch or yuvakon ne kaha ki vah rahul gandhi se ab dobaaraa nahin milenge or na hi unhen ralegansiddhi aamantrit kiya jayega to mujhe khushi hui
 i value the self-esteem that youth show
 ’ gandhivadi netaa ne kaha ki unhone pratinidhimandal ko janalokapal vidheyak ke liye rahul se samarthan lene kii salaah di thi lekin durbhaagya se mulaakaat hi nahin ho pai
 He said that the delegation did not go to Delhi to make any demand, 'political leaders in the country have made the youth helpless
 main bhrashtachar virdohi andolan ko majboot karuunga or yuva shakti ko jaagrath karuunga
 'photo: Rahul Gandhi did Hazratbal's visit in Srinagar, said that when he was fasting at Ramlila Maidan in August, Thomas Ralegansidhi came and was so impressed by the work done here that he felt that Rahul should come here
 unhone kaha, ‘ham raajnneetik netaaon ko ralegansiddhi aamantrit nahin karte
 But if anyone comes, we will fully welcome him
 ham gram vikaas par kisi ke saath bhi charchaa karne ke liye taiyaar hai
 Hazare said that it seems that this issue of rural development is not being taken seriously at the national level
 unhone kaha, ‘maine unase (sarpanch or unke dal se) kaha ki desh ke vikaas se jude muddon par charchaa karnaa jaruri he or isiilie ve dilli gaye the
 He did not go there to ask anything from Gandhi or Thomas
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘lekin maine tivi par dekha ki sarpanch or unke saath gaye log rahul se mili bina khaali haath aa gaye

 a senior official told NDTV that these terrorists keep shifting from one place to another in their bunkers and are trying to infiltrate from where they get a chance
 takneekee intercepts ke jariye aanka ja rahaa he ki ghuspaith karne kii firaaq main jo aatanki baithe hai, unki sankhya 100 ke aasapaas he or sialkot main jo dasta koshish kar rahaa he, usamen paanch se chah aatanki bataaye ja rahe hai
 In the meeting of the Unified Head Quarters, it was discussed how to reach the terrorists who are present in the valley, an official said
 takreeban 150 se 180 aatanki ghati main sakriy hai or 20 ke aasapaas jammu ke poonch or rajouri ilaake main, 13 log north or south kashmir main hai
 The terrorists are taking advantage of the fog on the international border and there is not much snowfall in the valley, so it can also infiltrate through valleys and small rivers, so the vigil has been extended not only on the international border but also on the line of control

 Voting will be held from 9 am to 4 pm
 aaj hi nattejey ghoshit kiye jaaenge
 The contest has become interesting with bjp's 9th candidate Anil Agarwal coming into the fray
 bijepi jahaan apane 9wein ummidavaar ko jitaane kii jaddojahad kar rahi he, vahiin sapa-congress or areldi sahit puraa vipaksh ekajute hokar basapa pratyaashee bhimrao ambedkar ko jitaane kii koshish main laga he
 However, BSP MLA Mukhtar Ansari and sp's Hariom Yadav are lodged in the jail, whose vote has been stayed by the court
 is tarah se vipaksh ko do vot kam ho gaye hai
 For the ten Rajya Sabha seats, 11 candidates were contesting for the Rajya Sabha elections, with Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, Dr
 ashok bajpeyi, vijaypal singh tomars, sakaladeep rajbhar, kanta kardam, dow
 Anil Jain, GVL Narasimha Rao, Harnath Singh Yadav and Anil Kumar Aggarwal have been declared their candidates as the 9th candidate
 sapa ne jaya bachchan, jabaki basapa ne bhimrao ambedkar ko pratyaashee banaaya he
 Now, except for SP in the country's most important state, Uttar Pradesh, no opposition party is in a position to win a single Rajya Sabha seat on its own
 basapa ne haal main gorakhpur or phulpur loksabhaa upachunaav main sahyog dekar sapa kii jeet main ahm bhoomika nibhaai he
 It is now the turn of the SP to repay the debt
 sapa-basapa kii dosti kii buniyadaspa-basapa ne 23 saal kii dushmani ko bhulaakar dosti kaa haath milaayaa he
 BSP chief Mayawati is taking a soft approach towards SP
 yah aage bhi jari rahegaa, iskaa sara daaromadar rajyasabha chunaav ke parinaam par nirbhar he
 This election will have a decisive impact on the prospects of the alliance between SP and BSP before the upcoming Lok Sabha elections
 isiilie sapa pramukh akhilesh yadav basapa pratyaashee ko jitaane ke liye harsambhav koshish main lage hai
 Opposition equation: The support of 37 mlas is necessary for a candidate to win in Rajya Sabha in Uttar Pradesh
 pradesh kii 403 sadasyeey vidhansabha main sapa ke paas 47 sadsy hai
 Even after winning the election to his candidate Jaya Bachchan, he has 10 additional votes left
 basapa ke paas 19 vot hai jabaki congress ke paas saat or rashtriya lokdal ke paas ek vot he
 In such a situation, only a coalition of these parties can send the tenth member to the Rajya Sabha, but even a little mess can spoil the whole math
 bijepi kaa ganitsoobe main sattadhari bijepi gathbandhan ke paas 324 vidhayakon kaa sankhyabal he
 On this basis, the BJP is set to win eight seats
 iske baad party or sahyogi dalon ke milakar 28 vot atarikt bachenge
 In such a situation, the biggest challenge before the BJP is to win its 9th candidate
 soobe main sabhi dal apane-apane maton ko ekajute rakhane or sahejane main jute hai
 BJP, SP and BSP have resorted to 'dinner diplomacy'
 akhilesh ne vidhayakon ko daavat di, jisamen shivpal yadav sahit nirdaleey vidhayak raghuraaj pratap shaamil hue
 It was a relief for the SP
 shivpal or raghuraaj ke saath aane ke baad bijepi kaa siyaasi sameekaran bigadataa najar aa rahaa he
 At the same time, BSP chief Mayawati also held a meeting of her legislators late evening on Thursday
 congress ne rajyasabha chunaav main basapa pratyaashee ko samarthan dene kaa elaan kiya he
 The bsp's equation may spoil it
 Naresh Agarwal, who left the SP unhappy after not getting a ticket in the Rajya Sabha, and his SP MLA son Nitin Agarwal are also likely to vote in favor of the BJP

 Onion 2 has crossed the 100 mark in retail
 5% tex se pareshaan lakhanu kii sabji mandipyaaj kii keemton ne ek baar phir sabhi ko rula diya he
 It has been a long time but there is no hope of a fall in onion prices
 pyaaj kii keemat ab kai jagahon par 100 rupee ko paar kar gai he
 Be it Rajdhani, Delhi or Lucknow, the price of onions in the retail market has crossed the three-digit mark of Rs 100
 lakhanu main pyaaj kii kami ke alaava 2
 5% tax is also causing problems to people
 baat pehle rajdhani dilli kii karte hai to kal tak jo pyaaj retail bazaar main 75 se 80 rupee bik rahaa tha
 That onion is now being sold in the wholesale market for Rs 80 to 90
 pyaaj kii lagaataar bad rahi keemat logon ke liye badi pareshaani banati ja rahi he
 Onions selling for 80 to 90 kg in the wholesale market are selling 110 to 120 rupees in the retail market
 kaarobaari maanate hai ki aane vaale kuch dinon main pyaaj ke daam or badhenge
 SD Gupta of Ghazipur mandi says that onion is coming only from Rajasthan Alwar mandi
 yah desh kii iklauti mandi he jo puure desh main is vakt pyaaj kii supplai kar rahi he jisase purti nahin ho paa rahi he
 In such a situation, onion prices are continuously increasing
 dukandaar kahana he ki wo rojaanaa 15 se 20 trek kii khapat karte the lekin ab wo sirf 1 se 2 trek hi mandi main aa rahaa he, jisko bechnaa bhi unke liye baari pad rahaa he
 Onion will come soon from Gujarat Mandi On the other hand, onion is selling 85 rupees per kg in Asia's biggest market Azadpur Mandi
 pyaaj kaarobaari rajendra singh kaa kahana he ki mandi main abhi rajasthan or afghanistan kaa pyaaj bik rahaa he jisaki keemat 55 se lekar 85 rupee tak he
 They also believe that Gujarat's onion will start descending in the mandi in the next 1 week, after which onion prices may come down
 rojaanaa pyaaj kaa kaarobaar karne vaale kaarobaari vijender kehete hai ki mandi se maal bechney vaala kisaan kharidne vaala aadhati he or aadhati se retail bazaar main bechney vaala kaarobaari bhi is vakt ghabaraaya hua he
 The price of onion which is 80 to 90 rupees in wholesale market, then it is selling in the retail market from 100 to 120 rupees by applying fare and wages, but selling onion from the wholesale market would be too big for the business of retail market
 Can be seen
 kaarobaariyon kaa kahana he ki ab log rojaanaa pyaaj kharidne main katautee kar rahe hai, aise main pyaaj stock karnaa unke liye bhi ghaatak siddh ho saktaa he
 Therefore, they are reluctant to keep onion stock
 dilli ke alaava lakhanu kepyaaj kii mandiki baat karen to vahaan bhi pyaaj ke bhav aasmaan chhu rahe hai jiske chalate thok par pyaaj bechney waalon or kharidne vaala donon ke aansu nikal rahe hai
 On the basis of wholesalers are selling, onion is being sold at Rs 80 per kg, which is selling at Rs 100 per kg in the retail market
 tex hate to sasta ho jaae pyajasath hi thok par ikkaa-dukka vyapaaree hi pyaaj ko baahar se trakon ke dwaara manga kar supplai kar paa rahe hai kyonki bengalooru or rajasthan se aane vaala pyaaj bhi kaaphi mahangaa ho gaya he jiske chalate unako sarkaar ko dhai percent alag se tex bhi dena hota he
 According to him, if two and a half percent tax is lifted, there will be some relief from the increased prices of onions, as well as loss of damage due to wear and tear when it reaches Lucknow
 jisaki vajah se jis rate par ham pyaaj laate hai us rate main hamen munafa nahin hota he
 Due to this, once a week is being harvested, onion is so expensive that it is difficult to sell
 ab ek bori pyaaj le jate hai to use ek hafte tak bechate hai kyonki graahak ab jo pehle 2 kilo pyaaj letaa tha vah dhai sau gram yaa aadha kilo hi le rahaa he
 Due to this, onion sales have come down significantly
 aaj pyaaj kaaphi mahangaa ho gaya he or abhi iske halaat thik nahin hai
 Lucknow wholesaler Rakesh says that onion has become very expensive
 pyaaj ko agar zyada rakhte hai to sarkaar bolti he ki jamkhori kar rahe hai
 We have also sold onions for 30-40 rupees per kg, but today the situation is not favorable

 ja musharraf ne tatkaaleen grih mantri laalkrishna adwani se kaha thah ''mistar adwani, main aapako saaf bataa duun ki daaud ibrahim pakistan main nahin he
 "while India has continued to hold the list of most wanted in every meeting of officials of the two countries, Pakistan has been categorically denying Dawood's presence
 bharat daaud ko pratyrpit karne ke liye pakistan par paryaapt rajnatik dabaav daalane main naakaam rahaa he
 He came closest to his extradition in 2003 and 2004 when Advani took up Dawood's case with the US
 america vitt vibhaag ne ek ekjacutive order ke tahat use 'speciali deginated global tebrist' qaraar diya, jisase america main uski sampatti jabt ho jaati or america naagarik ke saath uske lenden par pabandi lag jaati
 It took some time that Pakistan would eventually accept Dawood's presence, but with political pressure coming down from India, he started re-establishing the old raga
 tabhi se daaud bharat main aatankwaadi karrwai karwaane ke liye apane anderworld network kaa istemaal kar rahaa he or nakli bhartiya noton ke dhandhe or aatankwaadi sanghathanon ke liye hawala lenden ke dhandhe main apana hissaa badha rahaa he
 Experts say that there is a case of putting Dawood in the special category in which people dangerous for national security are kept
 khufia beuro ke purv pramukh ajit dobhaal kaa kahana he, ''america ne osama bin laden kaa sirf isliye peechha nahin kiya kyonki usne 9 / 11 hamalon kii sajeesh rachi thi balki vah unke liye spasht or nirantar khatra tha
 Law experts say that with other options to extradite Dawood, the need to exert pressure on Pakistan to get him extradited to India, along with the other options of extraditing Dawood
 1993 ke visphoton ke maamle main vishesh sarkari vakil ujdgaval nikam kaa kahana he, ''sabase pehle america ne daaud ko antarrashtriya aatankwaadi ghoshit kiya, ab bharat ko america se kahana chahie ki vah pakistan par use panaah na dene ke liye dabaav daale
 In 2006, a Special Terrorism and Destructive Activity (prevention) Act (TADA) court convicted and punished 100 of the 129 accused in the Mumbai attack
 yah bharat ke itihaas main sabase lanbaa chalane vaala mukadmaa he
 Indian investigators accept that there is no investigation in which the 1993 blasts have been conclusively linked to Dawood
 un visphoton se daaud ko jodne vaala sirf ek ikbaalia bayaan he, jisamen ek vyakti ne police ke saamne sweekaar kiya ki usne tiger memon or teen agyaan pakistaniyon ko visphot kii sajeesh rachate dekha tha
 Former CBI director Joginder Singh says, "even if we bring Dawood here, can we blame him in the 1993 blasts case?" We have only one confessional statement made before the police which is not valid in court

 ' varisht patrkaar or sampadak alok mehta aajkal televijan dibet kaa bada cheharaa hai
 The sharp edge of the pen and the soft smile on his face is his special identity
 mehta apni lekhnee va vichaaron main spashtataa ke saath hi apane behtareen sambandhon ke liye bhi mashhoor rahe hai
 Regardless of the institution they were in, whether in power or opposition, their journalistic neutrality was not questioned
 rajdhani ke patrakarita jagat hi nahin siyaasi jagat main bhi aaj unki acchhee-khaasi dhak he
 But this editor, journalist Alok Mehta, was not produced in a day
 iske peeche ek lambey anubhav kaa bhi haath he
 Mehta, who started his journalism in 1971 as a parliamentary and political affairs reporter in 'hindustan Samachar', worked as a 'weekly Hindustan' correspondent in Delhi from 1976 to 1979
 saal 1979 main mehta kaa chayan vaayas of germany, colon ke hindi vibhaag main sampadak ke rup main hua, jahaan ve 1982 tak rahe
 When he returned to India, he started working as a political correspondent in the weekly 'dinman'
 1988 se 1993 tak 'navabharat times' patna ke sthaneey sampadak ke rup main yogadan dene ke baad dilli main 'navabharat times samachar seva' ke sampadak bane
 He was the Executive Editor of Dainik Hindustan from 1994 to September 2000
 oktober 2000 se july 2002 tak 'dainik bhaskar' ke sampadak rahe
 Then Newdunia took charge in Delhi, but before that he was also the editor of 'outlook Weekly'
 vah editors gild of india ke adhyaksh bhi rahe
 He was the first editor of Hindi to be elected to this post
 mehta bhartiya press parishad ke sadsy bhi rahe
 In addition, he was a trustee of the National Book Trust, Raja Rammohun Roy Library Foundation and Prem Bhatia Memorial Trust, as well as members of the Hindi Ministry's Foreign Advisory Committees and the National Commission of India at UNESCO
 alok mehta ko unki pustak 'patrakarita kii lakshmana rekha' par saal 2006 main 'bhaaratendu harishchandra puraskaar' se sammanit kiya gaya tha
 In the same year, he was awarded the 'sahityaar-patrakar Samman' of Hindi Academy and the prestigious 'journalism Bhushan Award' of Uttar Pradesh Hindi Institute
 varsh 2007 main unhen 'haldi ghati sammaan' bhi mila
 Apart from this, he has also been awarded 'national Sadbhavana Award', 'national Tulsi Samman', 'indira Priyadarshini Award' and 'best Journalism Award'

 Read on literature Aaj Tak, part of his book 'kalam ke Senapati' written on Hindi journalism and the role of editors
 yah pustak mehta ke sansmaranon ke bahaane hindi patrakarita ke gauravshaalee yug ke saath hi bazaar ke dabaav main uske vyavsaay ke rup main parivartit ho jane kii gaatha bhi he
 Book excerpt: The great commander of the soldiers of Kalam's Senapatikalam can be called the editor of the army
 jamaana talwaar, top, tanks, ladaaku vimaan yaa jahaaj athwa mixilon kaa ho, senapati nirantar taiyaari karte hai
 They do not have to wage war constantly, but the challenge of making their editorial team constantly vigilant, precise, restrained, sharp, honest, fair and successful, with the editor's ideological dilemma creation, showing the miracles of his pen
 sainikon ke ghaav dikhte hi upachaar kii vyavastha hoti he, lekin sampadak ke ghaav-dard ko dekhnaa-samajhnaa aasaan nahin or upachaar bhi bahut kathin
 Millions of people are overwhelmed by seeing the miracles of the pen, praised, criticized for disagreeing
 sampadak kii nishpakshta or garima se unhen ‘star’ maanate hai, lekin unke sangharsh kii bhanak bahut kam logon ko milti he
 During my journalistic journey of more than 45 years, i have got opportunities of close contact with editors, publishers, owners, politicians from an early age
 shreshthatam sampadakon ke saath kaam karne ke avasar mili or jinke saath kaam nahin bhi kiya, aise kai varisht sampadakon ke saath editors gild ke sakriy padaadhikari ke rup main jude rahane se unki safaltaaon ke peeche rahe sangharsh kii jaankariyaan milti raheen
 a number of well-known editors wrote their autobiographies, but most editors did not print in newspapers or books
 sangharsh kii antarkthaayen duniya ke saamne nahin rakhin
 That is why i find it necessary to give glimpses of the darkness, pointed claws, difficulties, dangers behind the dazzling posts
 har kadam par amrit kalash ke liye khai paar kerani hoti he
 One has to drink poison like Shiva himself
 girakar uthanaa padataa he
 The society has to get a feeling of staying alive from its pen by repeatedly getting injured from the inner self
 dariyaa main gahari dubkee lagane ke baad phir baahar nikalakar tairnaa or kinare pahunchnaa padataa he
 The final stop of the editor's race, swimming, flight is nowhere to be seen
 antim saans tak kalam kii dhar dikhaate rahane kii prabal maansikta sampadak kii rahati he
 Comparing journalism of the freedom movement is neither fair to me nor possible to me
 isi tarah aazaadee ke baad 20-25 varshon tak us patrakarita kaa asar bana rahaa
 It will be fortunate that since about 1970, there were opportunities to see and understand the rise, struggle, defeat and defeat of the editors in journalism
 patrakarita main ise krantikari badlaav kaa yug kahana anuchit nahin hoga
 Expectations from editors also changed at all levels
 bhoomikaayen badalati dikhin
 Politics, power, managerial capital, corporate and market demands, the textual hunger of distant readers, the cooperation of their own peers, the opportunity to see and face opposition, and opportunities to deal with
 sabase pehle aadhunik bharat ke shreshthatam hindi sampadakon main agrani apane sampadak rajendra maathur se judi sangharsh yatra kii ek jhalak pesh karnaa jaruri he
 While a professor in the prestigious college of Indore, Rajendra Mathur started writing in the state's leading newspaper 'naiduniya'
 rashtriya-antararashtriya maamalon par unki tippaniyon ne pathakon ko hi nahin, prabandhakon or unke varishthatam partner pradhan sampadak rahul barpute ko bhi chamatkrit kar diya
 Therefore, in 1970, Rajendra Mathur was added as a full-time editor with a editorial extension to keep the page number of the newspaper from 8 to 12
 kuch hi maheenon baad ek workshaap main likhit pratiyogita ke aadhaar par mujhe ujjain ke anshkalik samvaadadaata ke bajaay indaur main sampadakeey vibhaag main up sampadak-samvaadadaata kii tarah judane kaa prastaav mila
 Had to accept such an attractive offer at such a young age
 phir sidhe rajendra maathur ke pehle chaynit patrkaar kaa gauravpurn sukh tha
 In spite of the limited staff in the editorial department, much like British journalism had to learn from Rajendra Mathur's amazing editorial leadership ability in morning and evening meetings for news and editorial page content
 sabase junior or kam umr ke baavjood kuch hi maheenon main maathur sahab ne sampadakeey prishth par lekh likhavane-chhapane ke saath puure prishth ke feechar likhane, prishth sangyojan ityadi kaa daayitv saunp diya
 Complete freedom in news and writing, but the use of restrained language continued to increase the prestige of the newspaper while verifying and sharpening the facts
 yon purnakalik hone se pehle isi akhbaar main rajendra maathur kii gahari mitrataa sampadakeey saathi sharad joshi or prabhaash joshi se rahi
 Therefore, a series of heated debates on political-social international subjects continued
 asal main rajendra maathur indore ke ek college main angreji ke praadhyaapak rahete hue pehle part time sahaayak sampadak kii tarah ‘naiduniya’ se jude the
 Leaving the job in 1970 to become a full-time editor
 rahul barpute, rajendra maathur, abhaya chhajalani, narendra tiwari ke bich kai muddon par badi asahmatiyaan rahete hue koi ek nishchit raay saamne aati
 This newspaper was founded jointly by Labhchand Chajlani, Narendra Tiwari and Vasanthalil Sethia
 swatantraaa aandolan ke sakshi samarthak hone se akhbaar par asar tha or dhan lagaaye bina sampadak rahul barpute kaa prabhaav ek maalik- partner se kam nahin tha
 From this point of view Rajendra Mathur and Abhay Chhajlani were loved by everyone due to the almost equal age group and Abhayaji was considered to be somewhat competitive
 abhayaji kii bhoomika akhbaar kii dainandin kawarej ke saath prasar or vigyaapan ke saath talmail kii bhi rahi
 With this view, Rajendra Mathur kept paying maximum attention to the superiority of ideas and news
 samasya tab shuru hui, jabaki rajendra maathur akhbaar ko pradeshik seemaa se baahar le jane ke liye prastaav badhaane lage
 The institution had limited capital, but the editorial quality was superior
 meri to umr kam thi, lekin samaj main aa gaya ki rajendra maathur ko narendra tiwari or rahul barpute kaa samarthan adhik mila
 i learned so much in one and a half years and from 10 am to 2 pm, i realized from work experience that the real work area should be Delhi, the capital of the country
 rajendra maathur or abhaya chhajalani ne samajhaayaa ki dilli to sagar he, vahaan pahchaan gum ho jaaegi, lekin maine hindusthan samachar agency main samvaadadaata banane kii chunauti swikaarna aavashyak samajha
 i got the blessings of Mr
 Mathur
 isliye teen maheene ke probeshan ke baad waapas nahin lautnaa padaa
 The waves of waves were eaten in the ocean of national journalism, crocodiles could not be made, but identity remained submerged
 baharhaal, is samay kendra bindu hai- rajendra maathur
 When the famous editor-in-chief Sachchidanand Hiranand Vatsyayan became editor of Navbharat Times around 1978, he proposed to Rajendra Mathur to be an assistant editor
 acchhee baatcheet hui
 The managers approved, but there was a salary limit in the Times at that time
 maathur sahab ke saamne sankat yah tha ki unki patni shrimati mohini maathur ko bhi college praadhyaapak ke rup main indore main jitna vetan mil rahaa tha, use milakar hone vaali aamadani kii purti times nahin kar paa rahaa tha
 
 times main sarvaadhik pratishthit hone ke baavjood agyeya apane sahyogi ke liye seemaa se adhik vetan nahin dilava sakate the
 He authored Shani and international radio journalist Gaurishankar Joshi, Prof
 siddheshwar prasad jaise sahyogi avashya jode, lekin navabharat times ke vistaar ke liye samvaadadaataaon kii acchhee team taiyaar karne kii puri chhot bhi prabandhan ne nahin di
 i know this because Agyeya had done a formal interview with the management to connect me and Ramsharan Joshi, but the management later put the brakes on
 main to vaise bhi saptahik hindustan main kaam kar hi rahaa tha or kuch maheenon baad radio vaayas of germany ke hindi sampadak ke rup main colon chalaa gaya
 Meanwhile, in late Rajendra Mathur was made the chief editor in 1981 to place Indore in 'naiduniya', but he too continued to flirt without elaboration
 1990 yaa 2000 ke baad jo log sampadak ke varchasv kaa mudda uthaate hai, unhen aise tathyon par bhi dekhnaa chahie ki agyeya, rajendra maathur, manohar shyaam joshi, es
 Nihal Singh, Kuldeep Nayar, b
 ji
 Renowned editors like Varghese, Khushwant Singh also had to deal with managerial limitations and had to leave the institute sooner
 1982 ke praarambhik maheenon main times main bhi navabharat times ko behatar banane ke liye prabandhkeey taiyaari shuru hui
 Keeping in mind the possibility of buying a new printing press, Ramesh Chandra, the General Manager of the Times, arrived in Cologne for the printing machines trade fair 'drupa' to be held in the city of Düsseldorf, Germany
 vahiin sahyogi mitra madhusudan anand or mere gharon main bhojan ke dauraan navabharat times ke badlaav par lambi charchaaen hoti raheen
 We were also in a mood to go back home from abroad
 indore kii tarah mujhe colon main bhi hindi patrakarita ke liye dayera simit dikh rahaa tha
 Then there was also the fact that in 1978 or not, in 1982, the Times could bring Rajendra Mathur as editor with a reasonable salary
 yon tab bhi saptahik hindustan se meraa istipha nahin hua tha or main vahaan ja saktaa tha, lekin maathur sahab ke aane par maine bhi times se judane par sahmati de di
 Returning home in July 1982, i met Mathur Saheb in Indore
 unhone mana ki vah ‘navabharat times’ main aane ko taiyaar hai, lekin kuch maheenon baad
 In such a situation, till then i should accept the post of political correspondent getting in 'dinman'
 maine vahi kiya
 When Rajendra Mathur arrived as Editor of 'navbharat Times' in October, he started printing my news in 'navbharat Times' while living in 'dinaman'
 swaabhaavik he ki is pahal se puraani li vaale ‘navabharat times’ ke puraane sahyogiyon ko bada ksht hua
 However, Mr
 Mathur had come for the rejuvenation of the newspaper
 unhone puraani mashiinon kii tarah ghisi-pity patrakarita ko badalane ke liye saare morche khol die
 At the end of about a year, i was dragged into 'navbharat Times' as a special correspondent
 rajendra maathur kii visheshta yah thi ki rajaneta yaa prabandhakon ke vichaar yaa sambandh kaise bhi hon, apni baat kii nishpakshta or panepan main kami nahin aane dete the
 Be the familiar Chief Minister, Union Minister or Leader of the Opposition- If you wish to meet and welcome the tea or office, even with the doors open, but if the opposite is true, the reality of the same leaders, write authentic news or critical comment highlighting the mess- He did not hesitate to print
 tabhi to congress, sanghebhajapa, samaajawaadee, communist vichaaron vaale netaa yaa samarthak sadaa bhram main rahete
 Compliment or condemn the editor? Rajendra Mathur's journalism did the job of showing mirror to the power system without spreading terror in the true sense
 apane se jude do-teen kisse
 The real name of Chandraswami associated with power was Nemichand Jain
 isliye times ke maalik jain parivaar se bhi usne apane thode sambandh jod liye the or kabhi-kabhaar unke bangale ke guesteroom main thahar bhi jaataa tha
 Once i wrote explosive news highlighting Chandraswami's political conspiracies
 pehle samachar sampadak parasdas jain kii najar padi
 They came running to my desk and said, 'you know who this is?' i said effortlessly, 'yes, i have known for years, Chandraswami cheating politicians
 ’ samachar sampadak ne jhunjhalaate hue kaha, ‘are bhai, jaraa samajho, yah jo bhi ho, maalikon ke guest house main bhi rahata he
 Do you understand what will happen when printed? i then spontaneously replied, 'know what will happen, Mathur sir
 maine unhen bataa diya tha
 Now show them the report you wrote
 vah uchit nahin samajhenge to, fadkar phenk denge
 i wouldn't mind
 main to keval sampadak ko jaanata hum
 What do i have to do with Chandraswami or the owners? ’ maine to apni baat kah di or chal diya
 The news editor went in front of Mathur Saheb and spoke and showed the copy of the report
 maathur sahab ne padhakar bina kuch kaate ‘tik’ lagaaya or kaha ki aap ise chhap dijie
 Who would dare to argue with them now? Now not one, at least five to seven reports were published on the bust of Chandraswami
 mujhe kabhi pataa nahin chalaa ki prabandhan se unki koi baat hui yaa nahin
 This was an example of fearless journalism
 doosraa kissa raashtrapati bhawan se judaa hua he
 Giani Zail Singh was the President
 ve hindi ke sampadakon or patrakaron ke saath bada sammaan or snehamay vyavhaar rakhte the
 As the editor of 'navbharat Times', Rajendra used to respect Mathur and also read newspapers regularly
 sharad joshi bhi vyangy ke stambh main gyaniji ko lekar yada-kada vyangyatmak tippaniyan bhi karte rahe
 As an officer of the Press Association of Special Correspondents Institute, once i requested, Gianiji also invited special correspondents from all the capital on tea and snacks in the evening, but after the terrorist incidents in Punjab only after one and a half years' i Wrote a report for 'navbharat Times', in which a person associated with terrorist activities in Rashtrapati Bhavan was given a guest post
 Detailing the serious information such as being kept in
 maathur sahab ne us report main bhi ek pankti nahin kaati or pehle prishth par pramukhataa se khabar chap gayi
 Gyaniji was not directly held liable, but the name of a senior trusted aide of Gyaniji, the press secretary of Rashtrapati Bhavan, came in him
 yah khabar bhi sarkaar ke hi pravartan nideshaalay dwaara nyaayalay tak pahunchaae gayi prakaran se lee gayi thi
 So there was no question mark on its authenticity, but it was probably the first time in India, when the sensational revelation of the sources directly of Rashtrapati Bhavan and terrorist activities was published in a newspaper
 hangaamaa swaabhaavik tha
 The next day, along with the editor-in-chief, the company's president and executive director was displeased with Rashtrapati Bhavan, but it was Rajendra Mathur who showed fearlessness on the issue and did not publish any apologies or corrections
 isi tarah 1985-86 ke daur main vishwa hindu parishad ke jain yaa daalamia pariwaron se bahut achche sambandh rahe
 Being a Hindi newspaper, religion related news, discourses or articles etc
 were also printed, but at the same time, the report of a chartered accountant about the mess in the accounts of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, wrote detailed news and Mathur Sahib gave the impression
 
 neeche se upar tak log duhkhi hue
 Sardar Angre, belonging to the Scindia family of Gwalior, was also mentioned in that report
 rajasi thatbaat vaale sardaar ongre ne kisi parichit ke madhyam se yah dhamkee bhi bhijwayi ki likhane vaale samvaadadaata yaa sampadak ko trek se kuchal denge, lekin maathur sahab ne ise hanskar taal diya or kaha ki ab raja-maharaja koi nahin he, saradaaron kaa bhi koi aatank nahin ho saktaa
 In this case also no explanation had to be printed
 punjab main chal rahe aatankwaad ko lekar maathur sahab kii behad tikhi tippaniyon se naaraaz sanghathanon ke dhamkee bhare patr milte rahe
 Mathur sahab was advised to take protection from the government, but he did not accept it
 vah to apni car ke alaava jarurat padane par saamaanya bas se bhi apane ghar jane main kisi tarah kii chintaa nahin karte the
 Senior leaders like Arjun Singh, Narayanadatta Tiwari or LK Advani used to meet Mathur Saheb in person
 arjuna singh madhya pradesh se hi unase parichit the
 i also had a good acquaintance with Arjun Singh, but during the elections in Churhat assembly constituency of Arjun Singh around 1987, i wrote an eye-witness report for the excesses being committed by his supporters and Mathur Sahib Published him prominently on the first page
 isi tarah arjuna singh ke punjab main rajyapal rahete bhopal main kerava baandh ke najadik ban rahe unke bhavy bhawan ko lekar photo ke saath lambi-chaudee report maine likhi or maathur sahab ne uski saraahna bhi kii
 It was never realized how much Arjun Singh expressed his unhappiness
 punjab kii sthiti par rashtravaadi vichaaron ke liye maathur sahab kii dhardaar tippaniyon ko lekar bhartiya janata party or sangh ke netaa bhi bahut prasann hote the
 The Congress government at the Center also agreed with his views on fighting terrorism, but on Advani's rath yatra, Mathur Sahib wrote frankly on the issues of protecting the nation more than the temple
 matlab laalkrishna adwani ke puure kaarykram kii aalochana hoti rahi
 At the same time, Mathur Sahab never hesitated to publish the news of his rath yatra or an article written by an editorial associate in support of it
 isi tarah boforce top kii kharidi main dallali liye jane ko lekar lage bhrashtachar ke gambheer maamalon par maathur sahab ne congress sarkaar kii dhajjiyaan uda deen
 In the Bofors scandal, my news filled with many new facts related to brokerage also continued to be featured prominently in the newspaper
 kai logon kii yah dharna bani ki maathur sahab dwaara unke sahyogi kaaryakari sampadak surendra pratap singh ke kaaran akhbaar vishwanath pratap singh kaa saath de rahaa he
 a few days later Vishwanath Pratap Singh also became the Prime Minister and by implementing the Mandal Commission report, the fire of movement spread across the country, then Surendra Pratap Singh and some other colleagues kept writing articles in support of the report of the Mandal Commission
 beuro main karyrat rambahadur raay vishwanath pratap singh kii yatra main saath dete hue report bhi likhte rahe, lekin maathur sahab swayan apni sampadakeey tippaniyon main or kuch anya sahyogiyon athwa lekhakon kii aalochanatmak baaten bhi pramukhataa se likhte-chhapate rahe
 They called it democratic journalism
 chandrasekhar ke pradhanmantri banane par times santhaan ke ek kaarykram main unki hi upasthiti main maathur sahab ne apane bhaashan main kuch vyangyatmak tippaniyan kar deen
 J
 pi
 Despite being a supporter of the movement and democratic expression, Chandrashekhar could not tolerate the remarks made with a simple and easy nature and the next day he expressed his strong opposition to the managers
 prabandhakon ne unki naaraazgi maathur sahab tak pahunchaayi
 The sensitive Mathur Sahib was very sad to know this
 unhen chandrasekhar se aisi ummid nahin thi
 He grieved inside
 duusari taraf vishwanath pratap singh or chandrasekhar ke saath achche sambandh rakhane vaale sampadakeey sahyogi apane dhang se prabandhan ke samaksh maathur sahab ke netritv ko lekar apni asahmatiyaan bhi bataate rahe
 The unfortunate part was that the senior colleagues who had been associated with the newspaper by Mathur Saheb continued to campaign to shore up Mathur Saheb, unknowingly for their personal interests
 ‘navabharat times’ main vyapak badlaav se hindi patrakarita ko ek nayi disha mil rahi thi
 Rajendra Mathur's proposals and efforts were getting the support of the management
 isliye lakhanu, patna or jaipur se bhi akhbaar ke sanskaran shuru hue
 There was already a version in Mumbai
 maathur sahab daftar ke andar or saarvajanik manchon se bhi yah kehete rahe ki koi akhbaar rashtriya akhbaar hone kaa daawa tabhi kar saktaa he, jabaki desh ke adhikansh rajyon main uske sanskaran hon
 He also wanted to see the presence of 'navbharat Times' in Hyderabad, Bangalore and Eastern states in West Bengal i
e
 Kolkata in the southern states
 antararashtriya str par praarambhik rup main padosi desh hone ke naate pakistan main bhi apane samvaadadaata rakhane kii unki ichha thi
 In the same sequence, he also told me that would i be ready to go to Pakistan? i gave my consent to go anywhere on his order
 kootnithik matbhedon or simaaon ke kaaran vah sambhav nahin hua, lekin lakhanu, jaipur, patna sanskarnon ko lekar bhi prabandhan se adhik raajnneeti or unionbaji ke dabaav patrakaron ne daale
 Along with the expansion, new managers were also recruited for various departments
 emb kii acchhee shiksha or upabhokta vastuon kii marketing karne vaale log media sansthaanon par apane dhang se nuktachini bhi karte rahe
 It also has an interesting anecdote
 lakhanu sanskaran shuru karne ke liye rajendra maathur kuch hafte lagaataar lakhanu main rahe
 Their stay was in a good hotel, which was being borne by the company
 subah se der raat tak apane sampadakeey sahyogiyon ke saath kaam karte hue kai baar maathur sahab daftar ke aasapaas kisi dhabas main jaakar bhojan kar lete the
 When his Lucknow travel bills reached the management after a few months, there was an objection to the hand written dhaba bills saying that there was a prior approval of the expenditure of the hotel, but there was no pre-approval on the bills of the dhaba
 haasyaaspad baat to yah thi ki hotel main rahane-khaane kaa bill saikadon rupayon main tha or dhabas ke bill chaar-chah sau rupayon ke bich hi the
 Mathur did not get excited on this
 unhone hanskar apane sahaayak ko kaha ki iske liye rameshchandra ji yaa acount mahaprabandhak se sweekruti dilava den, yuva manageron ko apana tarika samaj main nahin aa saktaa
 In the management, the president of the institute Ashok Jain and youth vice-president Sameer Jain respected Rajendra Mathur very much
 samir jain apni shankaa samaadhaan ke liye do-do ghante maathur sahab se charchaa bhi karte the
 On the other hand, when Dinanath Mishra was appointed as local editor in the Patna edition, his old colleague and like-minded Nandkishore Trikha, on behalf of his National Union of Journalists, sent a lengthy letter of protest to the management
 us virodh se deenanath mishra ko bheje jane kaa nirnay to nahin badla, lekin patrakaron kii aapasi katutaa dekhakar maathur sahab or mujhe bahut dukh hua
 Once on occasion, i also expressed my opposition to such activities for the same union meeting
 maathur sahab ko praarambhik maheenon main bhi sampadakeey parivartanon ke liye times kii union kaa virodh bhi jhelana padaa
 Journalists who used to operate locksmiths throughout the day as reporters in the evening and paid salary after Khanapurti, had to face the problem of closing shoplifting with new editorial policies
 aise hi ek patrkaar nagar nigam kii raajnneeti main sakriy rahane ke kaaran daftar main do-chaar din hi aane par bhi apni puri tankhwaah lete the, unhen bhi kaam karne ke liye kahe jane par baari pareshaani hui, lekin aise chhutbhaiya virodh or unionbaji kaa asar na to maathur sahab par hua or na hi prabandhan par, lekin 1990 ke aasapaas varisht sahyogiyon ne samir jain ke dimag main yah vichaar foonka ki ‘navabharat times’ ke saath -saath ‘times of india’ kii bhi saamagree bazaar main pahunchane ke liye times kaa ek hindi sanskaran alag se nikaala jaae
 At that time, in the 'navbharat Times', the Times was definitely printed when there was some special news, but its originality was maintained
 surendra pratap singh jab ‘dharmayug’ main the, tabase meraa unka parichay tha
 When he became editor on Sunday, i used to write the occasional political report with his special request and permission of Manohar Shyam Joshi while staying in 'weekly Hindustan'
 germany se bhi maine ravivaar ke liye kuch feechar likhe the
 Similarly, Rajendra Mathur was also impressed by the success of Surendra Pratap Singh on Sunday
 isliye jab surendra pratap singh ne navabharat times se judane ke liye maathur sahab ko patr likhaa, tab maathur sahab ne unhen laane ke liye bhoomika banaayi
 It was late to be placed in the Lucknow edition, but Surendra Pratap Singh was appointed as the local editor of the Mumbai edition after being placed in the Mumbai edition
 angreji akhabaaron kii drushti se times kaa mukhyalay us jamaane main mumbai hi mana jaataa tha
 That's why Sameer Jain also spent a few days in Mumbai
 vahiin surendra pratap singh ne sampadakeey gunvattta ke saath marketing ke jariye adhik munaafe ke formulon par samir jain ko prabhavit karne kii koshish kii
 That is why S
 after one and a half years
 pi
 Singh was transferred to Delhi and made Executive Editor
 isse 1982 se pehle kii team kii dhili- dhaali puraani style ke kaam ko badalawaane main suvidha hui
 Even before Surendra Pratap Singh came to the institute, i once gave Sameer Jain a letter of suggestion to put an executive editor with Mathur Saheb and some other changes with a view to modernizing Navbharat Times
 tab samir jain ne mujhase yah kaha tha ki akhbaar main chhapane vaali saamagree se adhik mahatva mujhe uski aamadani badhaane se he
 The management's job is not to count the newspaper copy, but to see the balance sheet grow stronger, but there is no doubt that Sameer Jain wanted to maximize profits by maintaining quality
 umr or anubhav kii drushti se ve rajendra maathur or girilal jain ke samaksh vichaaron kii asahmatiyaan to vyakt kar dete the, lekin kisi tarah kaa sidhaa hastkshep nahin kar paa rahe the
 Through Surendra Pratap Singh in Navbharat Times and Dilip Padgaonkar in Times, Sameer Jain was able to see his formulas in practice
 isliye times ke anudit akhbaar ke prastaav ko unhone amali rup dene kii thaan lee
 Surendra Pratap Singh once suggested that Mathur Saheb is a great intellectual editor, so he should be entrusted with the task of extracting a best magazine like Reader's Digest instead of Navbharat Times, but the president or executive of Dharmayuga and Dinman Directors could not agree to such a magazine
 tab times ke anudit akhbaar ke liye badi chaturaai se maathur sahab dwaara hi laae gayi sahaayak sampadak vishnu khare ko aage badha diya gaya
 Two assistant editors were also appointed along with Vishnu Khare
 anudit akhbaar kii is yojana ke liye rajendra maathur se kisi tarah kaa vichaar-vimarsh nahin hota tha
 Mathur saheb and Rameshchandra Jain were deeply saddened at preparing to launch such a newspaper in their own institution
 yah aprasannataa company ke adhyaksh ashok jain tak bhi pahunchi or kuch maheenon ke baad ise puri tarah se thande baste main daal diya gaya
 The translated newspaper never came out, but after the demise of Mathur Saheb, it became tabloid-style while being Nabhata broadsheet, translated and spiced up
 1988-1991 ke bich kii kuch ghatnaon kaa bhi zikr karnaa aavashyak lagata he
 Due to certain failures and some serious complaints of the Patna edition, Mathur Sahib approved Surendra Pratap Singh's proposal to change the local editor
 sthaneey sampadak ke liye vahaan pehle se karyrat arun ranjan ko hi rakhe jane kaa prastaav surendra pratap singh kaa tha, lekin maathur sahab bihar ko badi chunauti maanate the, isliye unhone mujhe patna sanskaran sambhaalane kaa prastaav rakhaa
 Surendra Pratap Singh and some other colleagues probably did not want this
 unhone maathur sahab ke saamne hi sidhaa virodh vyakt nahin kiya, lekin samir jain tak kai tark rakhe
 There was also a ridiculous argument among them that Alok Mehta was sitting with Pakistani diplomats in a music gathering and a photo is also found as proof of that
 matlab yah ki pataa nahin inke sambandh pakistan kii kisi agency se jude hue na hon
 Before the same Times management, there was a complaint before that due to being in Hindusthan news, i must have had deep relations with Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh
 rajendra maathur or rameshchandra ji is tarah kii ool-jalul baton ko hansee main uda diya karte the
 Therefore, the proposal related to Patna also remained hanging for two-three months, but finally President Ashok Jain approved to send me to Patna only on the recommendation of Mathur Saheb
 patna sanskaran main bhi kuch maheenon baad teen–chaar naye up sampadak or samvaadadaata rakhe jane the
 Then, as Principal Editor, Rajendra Mathur himself reached Patna and took the written examination of about 30 people
 phir intervyuu main mujhe or patna ke mahaprabandhak ko saath main baitaakar chaar yuva patrakaron ko chunaa
 Appointment letters were also given to them at the local level
 lagbhag do hafte baad times ke pradeshik sanskarnon kii incharge nandita jain (ashok jain kii suputree) ko surendra pratap singh ke jariye yah soochna mili ki patna main chaar nayi niyuktiyaan hui hai
 Nanditaji called me and asked how four new appointments were made there
 i told him that Rajendra Mathur selected him after examination and interview and he started working
 us jamaane main mobile nahin tha or saamaanya phone par kuch minuton kii hi baat ho paati thi
 Therefore, in short, Nanditaji said in a sharp note that who are the people who appoint Rajendra Mathur? i answered him from my side that as the Chief Editor, i only know Rajendra Mathur
 prabandhan se talmail vahi karte honge
 For this you can understand from them how appointments were made
 nanditaji ne aadesh ke lahaze main kaha ki aaj shaam chaar baje tak un logon ko sevamukt kar diya jaae
 He hung up
 thodi der baad maine maathur sahab ko phone karke kaha ki main telex par apana istipha bhejnaa chahta hum
 If they wanted to know the reason, then i told them that Nandita Jain refuses to know you, then there is no point in my living
 main to sirf aapako jaanata hum
 Mathur saheb immediately said with great seriousness that you will not do anything
 aap shaanti se baithiye, jo kuch karnaa he, main hi karuunga
 Perhaps he informed Ashok Jain and Executive Director Rameshchandra Jain of such interference
 in donon ne bhi is tarah kii baat par apni aprasannataa vyakt kii or kaha ki aap patna ko suchit kar dijie ki naye niyukt logon ko hataane kii koi jarurat nahin he
 In this way the case became cold
 tab times santhaan se judi companiyon kii chini mil hoti thi or jain dharmavalambiyon kaa ek tirth sthaan bhi sanyukt bihar kshetra main aata tha
 Therefore, the management's keen interest was also in Bihar, but there was no interference
 bahucharchit chaara cond kaa bhandaphod karne vaali pramanik or dastaveji khabaren sabase pehle hamane navabharat times ne hi chhaapin
 Then the supporters of the then Chief Minister Lalu Prasad Yadav also tried to attack the printing unit of the Times and set it on fire, but the result of the editorial persistence of Rajendra Mathur was that i or any editorial colleague was never informed of any interference or opposition from the management Received rajendra maathur ke loktantric swabhaav kaa anuchit laabh kuch sheersh sahyogiyon, patrakaron evam manageron ne uthaaya
 Not only this, to make the owners happy, they put small obstacles of poor quality
 bahari raajnneetik patibaddhta or swaarthon ke kaaran ve vyavastha se hit sadhate rahe
 Mathur saheb could write or speak blatantly bitter words in front of presidents-prime Ministers, owners of the company, but he was deeply saddened at the wickedness of some people who were called his own strangers
 bahut si baaten sambhavtah shrimati mohini maathur yaa gahare mitra sharad joshi ko avashya bataa dete rahe honge
 Can not claim, but being the first supreme disciple, some things of the mind were also heard by me
 company kii andaruni khinchataan or bahari maahaul se duhkhi hokar mujhase ek baar unhone yah bhi kaha tha ki ‘pani sir se upar nikalne kii sthiti main yadi main times samooh chhod duun, to khushvanth singh kii tarah kollam to likh hi luungaa
 'meaning because of conspiracies or hallucinations, the company would have resigned immediately if he had tried to place them somewhere
 duusari taraf ham jaise sahyogiyon ko yah ahsaas bhi ho rahaa tha ki unke sabase puraane mitra prabhaash joshi ke kuch prayaason evam baton se maathur sahab aahat the
 Prabhashji's arrival at his home in the last few years was an undeclared taboo
 prabhaash joshi or unke param priy kuch saathi maathur sahab ke bajaay prabhaash joshi ko hi bada safal sampadak maanate the
 Due to such internal wounds, the sensitive Mathur Sahib left goodbye to this world at the age of 56 due to accidental heart attack
 unke jane se navabharat times to anaath jaisaa ho hi gaya, shreshthatam hindi patrakarita kii pragati ke liye bhi kutharaghaat sa ho gaya
 He transferred me from the management to Delhi in spite of all the obstruction, a month and a half before his death, but without him no one had the power to preserve the entire structure of the newspaper
 vastav main kisi bhi prabandhan ko munaafe kii chintaa hona uchit kaha ja saktaa he, kyonki vartmaan daur main adhikansh companiyaan ‘gandhi-nehru’ yug kii tarah seva or saamaajik jaagrukta laane ke liye samachar santhaan nahin chalaati hai
 Three generations passed out, but the editor's institution and the entire journalism have been suffering more due to the aspirations, selfishness, self-devotion etc
 of journalists and editors
 navabharat times bhi usee sthiti kaa parinaam he
 After Mathur Saheb, the Times Group did not appoint anyone as editor-in-chief or even an editor
 niyam-kanoonon ke kaaran samaacharon ke liye uttaradaayi or dilli-mumbai market sthaneey sampadak yaa kaaryakari sampadak kaa ullekh print line main nunatam 8 points main chhapane laga
 S
 as executive editor
 pi
 Singh was also the closest to Sameer Jain, but he was offered the position of director in the company, not an unicameral editor
 kuch maheenon baad es
 P
 singh ne istipha de diya
 It was not that this news only happened on the Hindi newspaper, the same fate happened to the very ambitious editors of Times of India sitting next to it
 jo varisht sahyogi dilip padaganvkar ke saath sampadak girilal jain kii kamiyon ko samirji yaa unke manageron ke samaksh pesh karte the, ve sahi arthon main kabhi girilal jain ke kad vaala sampadak pad nahin paa sake
 Sometimes he was given a huge salary company with positions like Executive Editor, sometimes Consultant Editor
 isliye ab bhi maalikon ko doshi tehraane ke bajaay patrakaron-sampadakon ko apni kerani, kathani, andruni markat se hone vaali kshati kaa manthan karnaa chahie

 kisaanon par bhi maar pad rahi he
 By the way, in his statement Pawar cautiously said that if the decision on demonetisation is taken to end black money, NCP supports it
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ke bayaan par pavaar ne kaha aap indira gandhi ko dosha dete hai

 Jobs are being impacted
 nae note kahin kuch khaas logon tak hi to nahin pahunch rahe hai, aisa najar aa rahaa he
 Demonetisation has killed farmers and laborers

 The terrorists are failing to crack down on them

 He said that currency is a very serious issue
 is par lottery denge, aisa kabhi suna nahin
 However, he dismissed the possibility of waging a public movement on this issue and said that he can do mass agitation, but how will the currency come out of it

 Opposition has expressed many questions and apprehensions about the closure of 500 and 1000 notes
 jediu netaa sharad yadav kaa kahana he ki sarkaar kaale dhan ko rokane kii jo baat kar rahi he
 How effective it will be, it is difficult to say, but black money inside the country will benefit, but what happened to that black money
 jo desh ke baahar logon ne jamaa kiya hua he
 The government had made very big claims that black money outside the country would be brought to it and the public was asked to deposit Rs 15 lakh in their accounts
 sarkaar ne yahaan ki karansi to badal di, kya vahaan kii karency badalawa paaenge
 Sharad Yadav said that by changing the currency here, the farmers will be troubled by the general public farmers, the government did not think about them
 aajkal logon ke paas 10 or sau rupee ke note nahin hote, to is sab se hone vaali pareshaani kaa kya hoga
 Politics is a decision; CPI (M) has expressed apprehension that the government has stopped 500 and 1000 notes to stop black money, it will have limited effect
 yah keval raajnneetik dikhaava maatr he, sarkaar kii ore se jo daawa kiya ja rahaa he ki 500 or 1000 ke note band karne se kalaadhan nakli note bhrashtachar or aatankwaad par lagaam lagegi, isamen koi dam nahin he
 Way to cover up the failures CPM says that the PM himself has believed that the highest amount of black money is outside the country, whereas fake notes can be of any amount, which 500 and 2000 new notes will be announced by the government
 Has done this, will the government be able to rein in fake notes in future
 ek mana hua sach he ki jo aatankwaad kaa paisa he vah electronic dhang se transfar hota he ,na ki cash tranjaction
 The CPM said that this is only a way to cover up the failures on the economic front of the Modi government
 idhar kendriya mantri rajeev pratap rudi ne in tamaam daavon or ashankaon ko jhuthalaate hue saaf kiya he ki pradhanmantri ke is faisle se bhrashtachar nakli karansi kaala dhan par roak lagegi, yah ek aitihaasik kadam he sabko is baat ko sweekaar karnaa chahie

 Hassan: The challenge of inheriting the Hassan Lok Sabha seat of Karnataka is considered the traditional seat of the Deve Gowda family
 is seat par purv piem echdi devgauda ke pote prajjwal revanna chunavi maidan main utre hai
 Prajjwal Revanna is the son of the state PWD Minister HD Revanna
 prajjwal ke upar dada kii raajnneetik viraasat sanbhaalane kii chunauti he

 In this seat, BJP is supporting Sumanlata instead of fielding its candidate
 2014 main yahaan se jedies ke sies puttaraju ne chunaav jeet darj kii thi
 After this, jds's LR Shivrammegowda won this seat in the by-elections held in 2018
 is baar kumaraswami ke bete nikhil apane parivaar kii raajnneetik viraasat ko sanbhaalane ke liye maidan main utre hai
 However, due to the alliance of Congress JDS, Nikhil Kumaraswamy's position is considered very strong

 Artists: Bipasha Basu, Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Doyle dhawandirector: Suparna vermakahani is how much of a film director lives
 vah ek saamaanya script ko achche treetment ke saath badhiya film main tabdeel kar saktaa he
 In this case the soul seems to have missed somewhere
 film kii kahani kaa theme acha he
 It is a triangle between the mother, father and daughter
 ek single madar maaya (bipasha basu) he
 She has a six-year-old daughter Nia (doyle Dhawan) who loves her father Abhay (nawazuddin Siddiqui) very much
 use nahin pataa uskaa pita uski maa par shaq karata tha or use peethta tha
 She does not even know that he is dead
 nia hameshaa apane pita se milane kii baat karti he or ek din abhaya kii aatma nia ko lene ke liye laut aati he
 This is where the story begins
 first half main kahani sarapat daudti he
 But in the second half, the film seems to lose its rhythm
 film kai seens main daraati he lekin kai seen thope hue se lagate hai
 Like an old lady sitting on the roadside saying that he has returned
 star apil aisa lagata he ki suparn verma ne nawaz par bharosa dikhaane kii bajaae technology par zyada yakeen kiya he
 After the second half, the soul of Nawazuddin, riding on the chariot of technology, is seen
 unki acting ke kaayal darshakon ko kaaphi dhakka lag saktaa he
 Seeing Nawaz who plays in the first half, he feels that he comes again and again in the scene but it does not happen
 doyal ne behtareen acting kii he
 At such a young age, his impressions were truly worth it
 bipasha basu ko horer filmein karnaa aata he
 Technology The sound of the film is very good, the makers of the film have used Hollywood's sound technology
 nia kaa maaya par tut padana, chaakuon kaa hawa main udana or aaine main aatma kaa dikhnaa kai behtareen drishy hai
 The impact of the film being in 3D would have been tremendous
 kamai kii baat suparn verma film ko hollywood kii tarj par bananaa chaahate the
 Everything went well till the first half, but in the second half the film seems to be out of his hands
 horer filmon ke shaukeen darshakon ko kuch niraashaa ho sakati he, thriller contant bhi kam he
 The story seems quite obvius
 supernatural filmon ke shaukeen, bipasha or nawaz ke jabardast fain ise dekhnaa jarur pasand karenge

 World Cup winning captain Kapil Dev said that Virat Kohli's form is not a matter of concern as India's fate in the upcoming Champions Trophy is not solely dependent on the Indian captain
 champiens trophy england main june ke pehle hafte main shuru hogi or maujuuda ipel main kohli zyada ran nahin juta paa rahe hai
 If Kohli's form would affect India's campaign in the prestigious ODI tournament, 1983 World Cup winning captain Kapil said, 'did you watch the Test match against Australia in Dharamsala? Everyone said that if Kohli does not play, India will lose
 lekin ham jaanate hai ki kya hua
 'he said,' It is unfair to say that other members of the team are underestimated, thinking that India's fate depends only on them (kohli)
 ’ 58varsh ke purv aal rounder ne kaha, ‘kohli team kaa ahm sadsy he,vah bada khilaadi he or vah jaanata he ki kaise khelnaa he or kab khelnaa he
 'madame Tussauds' wax statue of Kapil was unveiled in Delhi
 kapil ne kaha ki bharat main nishchit rup se jeetne kii kaabiliyat he lekin yah nirbhar karata he ki ve toornament ke dauraan apni yojanaon ko kaise karyanvit karte hai
 Kapil said, 'I think the team looks good
 bhartiya team pichley paanch varshon se acha khel rahi he lekin yah isi par nirbhar karata he ki ve match ke din kaisaa pradarshan karte hai
 We definitely have the ability to win
 lekin ve khud ko kaise dabaav mukt banaaye rakhte hai or pratidwandvi team par dabaav banaate hai,yahi ahm hoga
 "when asked if a particular bowler can prove important to the Indian team, he said," It is not just a matter of a bowler because the team wins
 koi gendbaaji main aguwai kar saktaa he lekin bagaiyr team sabhi ko ekajute hokar pradarshan karnaa hoga tabhi team ke paas jeetne kaa mauka hoga
 "he said," i think that today's young players probably have more passion than us, we were immature but today's youth are professionals
 ’bhartiya chayankartaaon ne yuva khilaadiyon ke bajaay anubhav ko tavajjo di he jinhone ipel main acha pradarshan kiya he
 Asked about the selection of the team, Kapil said, 'if they had chosen the young team, you would have said that they have ignored the senior players
 isaliye chayankartaaon kii aalochana karnaa sahi nahin samajhataa
 They have done a good job
 meri raay bhale hi alag ho sakati he lekin unki aalochana karnaa meraa kaam nahin he
 "india does not yet have a bowling all rounder of their kind and when asked if any other Kapil Dev will come out of the country, he said," It is impossible
 mai kaamana karata hum ki mere se zyada behatar100kapil dev bharat se nikalen
 "he said," But it is not a matter of being a fast bowler all rounder
 agar aap aar aswin yaa ravindra jadeja ko dekho to ve bharat ke liye achche aal rounder bane hai
 That is why i think there are a lot of all-rounders in our team
 kapil ne kaha, ‘mujhe lagata he ki team acchhee dikh rahi he
 The Indian team has been playing well for the last five years but it depends on how they perform on match day
 hame nishchit rup se jeet darj karne kii kaabiliyat he
 But how they keep themselves free from pressure and pressure on the rival team will be important
 ’yah poochne par koi vishesh gendbaaj bhartiya team ke liye mahatvapurn sabit ho saktaa he to unhone kaha, ‘yah sirf ek gendbaaj kii baat nahin he kyonki team jitati he
 One can take the lead in bowling but without the team all have to perform in unison only then the team will have a chance to win
 ’unhone kaha, ‘mujhe lagata he ki aaj ke yuva khilaadiyon main shaayad hamase zyada junun he,ham aparipakk the lekin aaj ke yuva peshewar hai
 The Indian selectors have preferred the experience over the younger players who have done well in the IPL
 team ke chayan ke bare main poochne par kapil ne kaha, ‘agar unhone yuva team chuni hoti to aap kehete ki unhone senior khilaadiyon kii andekhi kii he
 Therefore, it is not right to criticize the selectors
 unhone acha kaam kiya he
 My opinion may be different but it is not my job to criticize them
 ’bharat ke paas abhi tak unki tarah kaa gendbaaji aal rounder nahin he or yah poochne par ki kya desh se koi doosraa kapil dev nikalegaa to unhone kaha, ‘yah asambhav he
 i wish that 100 Kapil Dev better than me leave India
 ’unhone kaha, ‘lekin yah ek tej gendbaaj aal rounder nikalne kii baat nahin he
 If you look at r Ashwin or Ravindra Jadeja, he has become a good all rounder for India
 isaliye mujhe lagata he ki hamaari team main kaaphi aal rounder maujuud hai’

 There are about 5-6 groups of monkeys living in this area in the forest where the river has dried up, but in some parts there is water in the pits, some groups of monkeys which are large in number and dominate that particular part which make the small group Can be intimidating
 pien mishra ke mutabik ho saktaa he ki hamale ke dar se apni gufaaon tak hi simit rahe or hit-stroke ke kaaran unki maut ho gai
 Mishra said that it is a bit strange that monkeys are vegetarians and usually people do not get involved in such struggles

 The commission has said in its report that the dreams of admission are shown to children, there are neither qualified teachers nor facilities to fulfill them, it seems clear that children are being used only to earn money

" Those who used to die at his words are now forbidden to speak to him
 aage unhone kaha, ve darbar sajaane ko kehete hai or bolne se pabandi lagaate hai
 But they are descendants of Kabir, hence cannot accept it

 He said that the path he had chosen was not right, he was changing, the free speech resolution was not right, he was changing what we had heard was not right, we are changing what we all thought was not right
 How did we keep quiet? Don't change the hopes of the world, we are speaking, now we are speaking the power of power, we said we will not speak the language of the people, we are the languages of the people They say just come from the noise of the noise, we are confident, 'I will not be remembered because, i was silent or spoke on the deviation of politics
