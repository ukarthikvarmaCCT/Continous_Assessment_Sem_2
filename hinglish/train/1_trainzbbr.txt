 bjp's PM candidate Narendra Modi's right hand and BJP General Secretary Amit Shah said on Saturday that the storm of change is blowing across the country and its impact will be seen even in Congress strongholds like Amethi
 gauratlab he ki congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi amethi se lagaataar teesri dfa jeet darj karne kii koshish main hai
 Addressing a rally in Phulpur Lok Sabha constituency, Shah said, 'the whole country is witnessing a wave of change
 dinondin yah hawa tej hi hoti ja rahi he
 Shah said, 'I was in Amethi on Friday and pay attention to my words, people in that area are going to vote for change this time
 'bijepi netaa kaa kahana tha ki vahaan jis tarah kaa maahaul he
 It reminded me of the 1977 elections when the Congress lost even in its stronghold
 aap mujhase likhit main yah le sakate hai
 Shah, who created the electoral cycle in UP for BJP, also lashed out at SP and BSP
 shah ne kaha, 'donon partiyon kaa sankeern, jativaadee agenda he or centre main congress kii aguwai vaali upie sarkaar ke bane rahane ke liye ve donon jimmedaar hai
 Taking a dig at Mulayam Singh Yadav, who is advocating for forming a Third Front government at the Center, Shah said, 'where are they going to get seats? Karnataka, Gujarat or Maharashtra? They will not get more than 10-15 seats in Uttar Pradesh

 The account of Tarun Vijay was first tweeted in favor of Congress President Rahul Gandhi's Kailash Mansarovar Yatra
 twit main likhaa gaya ki jo log rahul gandhi kii kailash yatra kaa mazaaq uda rahe hai, aisa ek hindu ko nahin karnaa chahie
 Whatever it is between Rahul and Shiva, there is nothing greater than Shiva

 tabhi to america kii rahane vaali amanda loy ne apane chote kad ko hi apana hausala bana liya
 Four-foot Amanda Loy participated in the bodybuilding competition for the first time last week and when she held the trophy, the entire hall echoed with applause
 amanda kii lambaai chaar foot or vajan 32 kilo he
 She has been a victim of hypochondrioplasia since birth
 yah ek tarah kaa bounaapan he, jiskaa matlab he ki unki shaareerik kad-lathi hameshaa boune vyakti jaisi rahegi
 Talking about her condition, Amanda says, "it's like an average body folded into a small packet"
 kai maheenon kii kadi troning ke baad amanda ne pichley hafte arizona ke mesa main yojit natural western uese figure compitishan main hissaa liya
 Dressed in bikinis and heels, Amanda looked the same as the rest of the contestants, except for her stature
 unhen chiyar karne ke liye unka puraa parivaar, dost or coach gordon bichar maujuud the
 According to Beecher, 'there is no doubt that Amanda was a fan favorite
 jab vah stage par ain to auditorium main maujuud logon ne jamkar unki saraahna kii'
 Despite her short stature, Amanda greatly influenced the judges
 unke varg main kul nau pratiyogi thim
 She came in at number four and took home the gleaming trophy
 nursing kii padhai kar rahi 22 saal kii amanda kaa maananaa he ki vah shaayad duniya kii pehali chote kad kii mahila hai jisane body building pratiyogita main bhaag liya ho
 According to him, "as far as my information and Google are concerned, i am the only woman of short stature who has participated in such shows"
 ab amanda ko ummid he ki vah apane is pishan ko profeshan main badal paaengi
 His coach Beecher is looking for sponsors who can help Amanda in body building
 aapako bataa den ki do saal pehle amanda ne body building ke bare main sochaa or 6 maheene pehle unhone dit or training kii ore dhyaan dena shuru kiya
 She started going to the gym 6 times a week
 ab unka aglaa compitishan may main hoga
 Amanda hopes that others will also be affected by her success
 unke mutabik, 'isse koi fark nahin padataa ki aap koun hai or kaise dikhte hai
 If you want to stay fit, then only Dedication is needed
 pradhanmantri hote hue bhi nagarpalika chunaavon main mili jeet par twit karnaa or kaaryakartaaon kaa utsaah badhanaa, ye narendra modi kii raajnneetik style he
 The victory of the civic elections of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka resulted in the effect of his tweet that the other big leaders of BJP also started encouraging their workers by tweeting
 bengaluru nikaay chunaavon main siten to congress kii bhi badi hai lekin jab rahul gandhi kaa twitor handle dekhne gaya to kuch nahin mila
 The future leader of the party could have encouraged the courage of his workers who may not have won, but brought more seats than before
 shaayad rahul gandhi sochate honge ki jab loksabhaa haar gaye to nagarpalika ke haarane se kya fark padane vaala
 Modi thinks Lok Sabha is fine, if the municipality wins it is even better
 yah donon hi udhaaharan bataa rahe hai ki raajnneeti ke morche par din raat koun data hua he
 There is no need to say whether the assembly election is important for the prime minister for whom the municipal elections are important
 media lagaataar likh rahaa he ki bihar vidhansabha kaa chunaav pradhanmantri modi ke liye behad khaas he
 Nobody tells why it is special
 kya 2014 ke janadesh ke vakt janata ne yah kaha tha ki aapako purna bahumat to de rahe hai lekin jab tak bihar nahin jeetenge us bahumat kii koi manyata nahin he
 Was the 2014 mandate a practice election before the Bihar Assembly elections
 kya loksabhaa kaa chunaav vidhansabha ke saamne lig match tha
 After the victory of the Lok Sabha in Maharashtra, Haryana and Jharkhand Legislative Assemblies, what remains is to be completed from Bihar
 zarur jeetna chahie lekin jeet gaye to pradhanmantri ke naitik bal par kya asar padegaa
 Is his moral strength or Iqbal weakened till he wins Bihar elections
 kya unka iqbaal tabhi kaayam hoga jab ve bihar jeet kar dikhaayenge
 Then he should have resigned after his defeat in the Delhi Assembly elections
 jis chunaav ke liye obama tak ko bulaayaa gaya
 The suit that was sewn up to auction
 kya ham or aap maan len ki dilli chunaav haarane ke baad pradhanmantri kaa loksabhaa vaala janadesh kam ho gaya he
 Has his ability to make decisions come down
 dilli chunaav ke vakt bhi kaha gaya ki unke ecchhatra netritv ke kaaran party ke netaa naaraaz hai
 Saying all this somewhere that he was not nervous that he brought Kiran Bedi to the ground overnight
 dilli ko loksabhaa samaj reliyaan karne lage
 Even after this, what happened if you lost? kya sarkaar tab nahin chali thi yaa ab nahin chal rahi he
 Till now it had been read that one election does not affect the other
 har chunaav pehle ke chunaav se alag hota he
 It is different even when the same party is winning every election
 vidhansabha kaa asar na to loksabhaa par padataa he or na loksabhaa kaa vidhansabha par
 One thing is said that the party that wins the Lok Sabha wins some elections in the vicinity
 khaskar upachunaav
 But remember the bypolls in UP and Bihar soon after the Lok Sabha
 bijepi kaa pradarshan acha nahin rahaa
 At the same time, people said that the Modi wave has ended
 phir kuch samay baad usee bihar ke upachunaavon main bijepi kaa pradarshan acha rahaa to ab nitish maanane ko taiyaar nahin hue ki ve haar gaye hai
 Every win is different in itself
 main samajhnaa chahta hum ki pradhanmantri modi ke liye bihar ko kyon itnaa bada maanak banaaya ja rahaa he
 Suppose if the BJP loses, will it take away the 2014 mandate from them
 kya ve istipha de denge
 Do they not deal with Nitish Kumar as the Chief Minister at the Prime Minister's residence yet? karte hi hai
 Someone will tell what will happen
 kai dinon se soch rahaa hum ki agar bijepi haar gai to kya hoga or jeet gai to kya ho jayega
 The senior journalists who have been the last professors of politics argue that there is a niche within the party that is waiting for defeat
 is keme kaa maananaa he ki bihar jeetne ke baad modi ko niyantrit karnaa mushkil ho jayega
 After losing, these people will start speaking
 main vaaki un logon ke bare main jaananaa chahta hum jo bijepi main rahete hue ab modi ko niyantrit karne kaa plan kar rahe hai
 The experience of meeting such courageous and interesting people can be quite romantic
 bade patrakaron ko in bahaduron kaa naam or cheharaa kuch to bataanaa chahie
 Who are these and under whose leadership are they going to challenge the modi-shah duo in the BJP? kya ye shatrughan sinha ke netritv main aage badhane vaale hai
 i am not saying that the influence of Modi and Shah era will never be weakened, but that Bihar will be defeated soon, let us put forward a strong argument
 aise kyon kaha ja rahaa he ki bihar main haarate hi pradhanmantri modi or adhyaksh amit shah istipha dekar nepal chale jaaenge
 If those who wanted to lose were confident of their ability then why did Delhi lose the chance after the election
 dilli main to bijepi kii loksabhaa main congress se bhi buree haar hui thi
 What can be more concrete proof that Modi wave has ended than winning just three seats out of 70
 maan lijie ki bihar main bijepi jeet jaati he to kya party ke bheetar modi virdohi khemaa congress main shaamil ho jayega
 If this is the case then why Modi and Shah's pair will perform their aarti after winning
 bhai aap hamaare hi saath raho bengal kaa chunaav aa rahaa he ab uskaa intazaar karo
 Another argument is being made that winning the election of Bihar is necessary for a majority in the Rajya Sabha
 rajyasabha ke ganit ke hisaab se bihar jeetne ke baad bhi 2016 tak bijepi ko rajyasabha main bahumat nahin milegaa
 By 2018, she will reach near majority
 tab jab bijepi bihar ke baad bengal or upi bhi jeet le
 Accordingly, if the central government sets out on the Vijay Yatra for the assembly elections, then it will come back to Delhi by 2019
 kya janata main is baat par vot maanga jayega ki ham to ji vidhansabha jeetne main lage the
 Forgot to work in the center
 zaahir he rajyasabha ke liye bhi bihar kaa chunaav mahatvapurn nahin he
 Political arguments are becoming absurd
 madhya pradesh main nagarpalika chunaavon main jeet mili to mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ko laga ki 2014 kii modi lahar ke baad ab agar koi lahar he to shivaraj lahar he
 He declared that Vyapam is not an issue
 aise bataane lage jaise vyapam par janadesh aayaa ho
 As the people of Madhya Pradesh have said, what a great job that the seats of medical students were sold with money
 jaalsaajon ke chakkar main funskar noujvaan jail chale gaye
 There were also reports of death of some people
 wel dan
 We support you
 jabaki usee samay supreme court se vyapam ko lekar khabaren aati raheen
 Every day a new case is being reported
 ek aaropee ke puraane teble kii chaanbin kii gai to lakhon rupee ke note nikal aae
 If the mandate on Vyapam has already arrived, then the Chief Minister should write to the Supreme Court that we have got the mandate by the Honorable Court, do not let the cbi's time be wasted on Vyapam
 vyapam kaa cese us janata ko waapas kar den jisane nagarpalika main hamen baari bahumat diya he
 Can a Chief Minister dismiss the scam charges from the mandate
 kya mukhyamantri chouhan yah chhot apane virodhiyon ko bhi denge
 The Congress did not win even after the Bhopal gas carnage accused Anderson
 jeet or haar ke baad raajnneeti samaapt nahin hoti
 It keeps going
 asli rajaneta hota he jo donon hi sthitiyon main nahin rukta he
 Bizarre analysts are not wondering what will happen to his politics if Lalu Nitish loses in Bihar
 kya unke liye ye chunaav mahatvapurn nahin hai
 Isn't it important for Rahul Gandhi and Congress
 kya rahul gandhi kaa imtahaan hone vaala he
 Even as Prime Minister, Narendra Modi has done many rallies in Bihar
 un par to 243 siton kaa bhaar he
 Rahul Gandhi has a weight of only 40 seats
 is hisaab se to rahul gandhi ko har vidhansabha main bees-bees reliyaan or tees-tees padayatraaen kerani chahie
 There is pressure to win on those who have won and there is no pressure to win on those who have lost, which is the political discussion
 tippaniyan What will happen after Bihar when the Prime Minister's political morale after losing Delhi has not been affected? thik he bihar se dilli kii tulana nahin kii ja sakati lekin apni lahar kii javaani main kisi nausikhiye netaa se haar janaa kya kam sadma he
 The Prime Minister fights every election seriously as of yet to be seen and known
 ye unki apni fitarat he
 Well, Vyapam and Lalit Modi could not speak anything on the case
 thik he ki mahangaai par kuch nahin bol paa rahe hai lekin iske baad bhi ve janata ke bich chale jate hai
 Those who have to speak, speak
 yah bataata he ki narendra modi kis had tak raajnneetik praani hai
 They do politics around the clock
 agar ve nagarpalika chunaav par twit kar sakate hai to rahul gandhi ko nagarpalika chunaav main jaakar padayatra kerani chahie
 Of course, the election of Bihar is politically important
 hamen yah bhi samajhnaa chahie ki 2014 kaa janadesh 2019 tak ke liye he
 Bihar is not even for the assembly elections
 raajnneetik charchaakaron ke liye chunaav kisi meley se kam nahin he
 As soon as he returned after winning Bihar, he would start writing that Bihar was easy, now he will show it by winning UP
 kya modi loksabhaa main 70 siten jeetne kii kamyaabi upi main doharaa paaenge
 o opponents of Modi within my BJP, the era has gone that the commander has gone to war on the border of Telangana and you will revolt and occupy the Sultanate of Delhi
 or kar bhi lenge to patrakaron ke zariye apni raajnneeti mat karo
 Seats have also increased in the Bangalore civic elections, but when Rahul Gandhi's Twitter handle went to see, nothing was found
 party kaa bhavi netaa apane un kaaryakartaaon kaa hausala to badha hi saktaa tha jo bhale na jeet sake hon magar siten pehle se zyada le aae
 Perhaps Rahul Gandhi must have wondered what difference it made to the loss of the municipality when the Lok Sabha lost
 modi sochate hai loksabhaa to thik he nagarpalika jeet jaaen to or bhi thik he
 Both of these examples are telling who is standing day and night on the political front
 jis pradhanmantri ke liye nagarpalika ke chunaav mahatv rakhte hon uske liye vidhansabha kaa chunaav mahatvapurn he yaa nahin kehane kii koi baat hi nahin he
 The media is constantly writing that the election of Bihar Assembly is very special for Prime Minister Modi
 kyon khaas he yah koi nahin bataata
 Did the people at the time of the 2014 mandate say that they are giving you an absolute majority but till Bihar will not win that majority has no recognition
 kya 2014 kaa janadesh bihar vidhansabha chunaav se pehle kaa practice chunaav tha
 Was the Lok Sabha election a league match in front of the assembly
 loksabhaa kii jeet ke baad maharashtra, haryana or jharkhand vidhansabhaon main jeet ke baad aisa kya baaki rah gaya jo bihar se puraa hona he
 One must win, but if won, what will be the impact on the moral strength of the Prime Minister
 kya unka naitik bal yaa ikbaal bihar chunaav jeetne tak kamazor ho gaya he
 Will his Iqbal stand only when he shows Bihar by winning
 phir dilli vidhansabha chunaav main haar ke baad to unhen istifa de dena chahie tha
 The election for which Obama was called
 jo suut silvai gai wo nilaam tak ho gai
 Should we and you believe that after losing the Delhi elections, the Prime Minister's mandate of Lok Sabha has reduced
 kya faisle lene kii unki kshamta kam ho gai he
 Even during the Delhi elections, it was said that the party leaders were angry due to their unanimous leadership
 kahin yahi sab kah kah ke unhen nervas to nahin kar diya gaya ki ve raaton raat kiran bedi ko maidan main le aae
 Rallies deemed Delhi as Lok Sabha
 iske baad bhi haar gaye to kya ho gaya
 Did the government not run then or is it not running now? abhi tak to yahi padhata aa rahaa tha ki ek chunaav kaa duusare chunaav par asar nahin padataa
 Every election is different from the previous election
 tab bhi alag hota he jab har chunaav ek hi party jeet rahi hoti he
 The Legislative Assembly has neither an impact on the Lok Sabha nor the Lok Sabha on the Legislative Assembly
 ek baat kahi jaati he ki jo party loksabhaa jeet kar aati he wo aas paas ke kuch chunaav jeet leti he
 Especially by-elections
 lekin loksabhaa ke turant baad upi or bihar ke upachunaavon ko yaad kiijie
 BJP did not perform well
 utane main hi logon ne kah diya ki modi lahar samaapt ho gai he
 Then after some time the BJP performed well in the same Bihar by-elections, now Nitish is not ready to accept that he has lost
 har jeet apane aap main alag hoti he
 i want to understand why Bihar is being made such a big standard for Prime Minister Modi
 maan lijie bijepi haar gai to kya unase 2014 kaa janadesh chhin jayega
 Will they resign? kya abhi ve pradhanmantri nivas main mukhyamantri ke taur par nitish kumaar se kaary vyavhaar nahin karte hai
 Let's do it
 koi to bataaye ki kya hoga
 i have been thinking for many days, what will happen if the BJP loses and what will happen if it wins
 raajnneeti ke antim professor ho chuke bade patrakaron kii daleel he ki party ke bheetar koi khemaa he jo haar kaa intazaar kar rahaa he
 It is believed that after winning Bihar, it will be difficult to control Modi
 haarane ke baad ye log bolnaa chaalu karenge
 i really want to know about those people who are now planning to control Modi while in BJP
 aise saahsee or dilachasp logon se milane kaa anubhav kaaphi romchank ho saktaa he
 Big journalists should tell the names and faces of these brave people
 ye koun hai or kiske netritv main bijepi main modi or shah kii jodi ko chunauti dene vaale hai
 Are they going to proceed under the leadership of Shatrughan Sinha
 main yah nahin kah rahaa ki kabhi modi or shah yug kaa prabhaav kamazor nahin hoga lekin wo bihar haarate hi ho jayega isaki koi thos daleel to saamne rakhen
 Why is it being said that Prime Minister Modi and President Amit Shah will resign and go to Nepal as soon as they are defeated in Bihar
 haar kii chaah waalon ko agar apni kaabiliyat par bharosa tha to dilli chunaav ke baad mauka kyon ganvaa diya
 In Delhi, the BJP had also lost badly to the Congress in the Lok Sabha
 70 main se maatr teen siten jeetne se zyaada thos pramaan kya ho saktaa he ki modi lahar samaapt ho chuki he
 Suppose the BJP wins in Bihar, then will the anti-modi camp within the party join the Congress
 agar aisa khemaa he to jeetne ke baad modi or shah kii jodi inaki aarti kyon utaaregi
 Brother, stay with us, the election of Bengal is coming, now wait for it
 ek or daleel di ja rahi he ki rajyasabha main bahumat ke liye bihar kaa chunaav jeetna zaruri he
 The BJP will not get a majority in the Rajya Sabha until 2016, even after winning Bihar by the calculations of the Rajya Sabha
 2018 tak wo bahumat ke kareeb pahonchegi
 Then when BJP wins Bihar and UP also after Bihar
 is hisaab se agar centre sarkaar vidhansabha chunaavon kii vijay yatra par nikal jaae to laut kar dilli aate aate 2019 aa jayega
 Will the public ask for votes on the fact that we were busy in winning the assembly
 bhul hi gaye ki centre main kaam bhi karnaa he
 Obviously, Bihar election is not important for Rajya Sabha
 raajnneetik daleelein betuki hoti ja rahi he
 After winning the municipal elections in Madhya Pradesh, Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan felt that if there is any wave after the Modi wave of 2014, then there is Shivraj wave
 unhone elaan hi kar diya ki vyapam koi mudda nahin he
 They started saying that the mandate had come on Vyapam
 jaise madhya pradesh kii janata ne kaha ho ki kitna shandaar kaam hua ki medical chaatro kii seat paise lekar bech di gai
 The youngsters went to jail after getting caught in a round of fraudsters
 kuch logon ke maut kii khabaren bhi ain
 Well done
 ham aapako saport karte hai
 At the same time, there were reports about Vyapam from the Supreme Court
 har din kisi nae cese ke darj hone kii khabar aa ja rahi he
 When an accused's old table was scrutinized, notes worth millions of rupees came out
 vyapam par agar janadesh aa hi gaya he to mukhyamantri supreme court ko likh den ki mananeey adaalat hamen janadesh mil gaya, aap vyapam par sibiai kaa samay barbaad na honen de
 Return the case of Vyapam to the public who has given us an overwhelming majority in the municipality
 kya koi mukhyamantri ghotaale ke aaropon ko janadesh se khaarij kar saktaa he
 Will the Chief Minister give this exemption to his opponents as well
 bhopal gas cond ke aaropee anderson ko bhagane ke baad bhi congress jiti kii nahin
 Politics does not end after victory and defeat
 yah chalati rahati he
 There is a real politician who does not stop in both situations
 vicitra vishleshankarta yah nahin soch rahe hai ki agar lalu nitish bihar main haar gaye to unki raajnneeti kaa kya hoga
 Are these elections not important for him? kya rahul gandhi or congress ke liye mahatvapurn nahin he
 Is Rahul Gandhi going to test? pradhanmantri hokar bhi narendra modi bihar me kai reliyaan kar chuke hai
 They have a weight of 243 seats
 rahul gandhi par to 40 siton kaa hi bhaar he
 Accordingly, Rahul Gandhi should conduct twenty-two rallies and thirty-thirty padayatras in every assembly
 jo jeeta hua he us par jeetne kaa dabaav he or jo haara hua he us jeetne kaa dabaav nahin he, ye koun si raajnneetik charchaa he
 The comments jab dilli haarane ke baad pradhanmantri ke rajnatik hausale par koi asar nahin padaa to bihar ke baad kya ho jane vaala he
 Well, Bihar cannot be compared to Delhi, but what a shock it is to lose to a novice leader in his youth
 abhi tak jitna dekha or janaa he pradhanmantri har chunaav ko gambhirtha se ladate hai
 This is his own nature
 thik he ki vyapam or lalit modi prakaran par kuch bol nahin paae
 It is okay that they are unable to speak on inflation, but even then they go out among the public
 jo bolnaa hota he bol aate hai
 It tells to what extent Narendra Modi is a political animal
 ve choubees ghante raajnneeti karte hai
 If they can tweet on the municipal election, then Rahul Gandhi should go for a walk in the municipal election
 beshak bihar kaa chunaav raajnneetik rup se mahatvapurn he
 We should also understand that the 2014 mandate is for 2019
 bihar vidhansabha chunaav tak ke liye nahin he
 Election for political discourse is nothing short of fair
 ve bihar jeet kar lautate hi ye likhane lagenge ki bihar aasaan tha, ab upi jeet kar dikhaayenge
 Will Modi repeat the success of winning 70 seats in Lok Sabha in UP
 he mere bijepi ke bheetar modi virodhiyon, wo zamana chalaa gaya ki senapati telugana kii seemaa par yuddh karne gaya he or aap baghaavat kar dilli kii sultanate par kabza kar loge
 And even if you do, do not do your politics through journalists
 jis pradhanmantri ke liye nagarpalika ke chunaav mahatv rakhte hon uske liye vidhansabha kaa chunaav mahatvapurn he yaa nahin kehane kii koi baat hi nahin he
 The media is constantly writing that the election of Bihar Assembly is very special for Prime Minister Modi
 kyon khaas he yah koi nahin bataata
 Did the people at the time of the 2014 mandate say that they are giving you an absolute majority but till Bihar will not win that majority has no recognition
 kya 2014 kaa janadesh bihar vidhansabha chunaav se pehle kaa practice chunaav tha
 Was the Lok Sabha election a league match in front of the assembly
 loksabhaa kii jeet ke baad maharashtra, haryana or jharkhand vidhansabhaon main jeet ke baad aisa kya baaki rah gaya jo bihar se puraa hona he
 One must win, but if won, what will be the impact on the moral strength of the Prime Minister
 kya unka naitik bal yaa ikbaal bihar chunaav jeetne tak kamazor ho gaya he
 Will his Iqbal stand only when he shows Bihar by winning
 phir dilli vidhansabha chunaav main haar ke baad to unhen istifa de dena chahie tha
 The election for which Obama was called
 jo suut silvai gai wo nilaam tak ho gai
 Should we and you believe that after losing the Delhi elections, the Prime Minister's mandate of Lok Sabha has reduced
 kya faisle lene kii unki kshamta kam ho gai he
 Even during the Delhi elections, it was said that the party leaders were angry due to their unanimous leadership
 kahin yahi sab kah kah ke unhen nervas to nahin kar diya gaya ki ve raaton raat kiran bedi ko maidan main le aae
 Rallies deemed Delhi as Lok Sabha
 iske baad bhi haar gaye to kya ho gaya
 Did the government not run then or is it not running now? abhi tak to yahi padhata aa rahaa tha ki ek chunaav kaa duusare chunaav par asar nahin padataa
 Every election is different from the previous election
 tab bhi alag hota he jab har chunaav ek hi party jeet rahi hoti he
 The Legislative Assembly has neither an impact on the Lok Sabha nor the Lok Sabha on the Legislative Assembly
 ek baat kahi jaati he ki jo party loksabhaa jeet kar aati he wo aas paas ke kuch chunaav jeet leti he
 Especially by-elections
 lekin loksabhaa ke turant baad upi or bihar ke upachunaavon ko yaad kiijie
 BJP did not perform well
 utane main hi logon ne kah diya ki modi lahar samaapt ho gai he
 Then after some time the BJP performed well in the same Bihar by-elections, now Nitish is not ready to accept that he has lost
 har jeet apane aap main alag hoti he
 i want to understand why Bihar is being made such a big standard for Prime Minister Modi
 maan lijie bijepi haar gai to kya unase 2014 kaa janadesh chhin jayega
 Will they resign? kya abhi ve pradhanmantri nivas main mukhyamantri ke taur par nitish kumaar se kaary vyavhaar nahin karte hai
 Let's do it
 koi to bataaye ki kya hoga
 i have been thinking for many days, what will happen if the BJP loses and what will happen if it wins
 raajnneeti ke antim professor ho chuke bade patrakaron kii daleel he ki party ke bheetar koi khemaa he jo haar kaa intazaar kar rahaa he
 It is believed that after winning Bihar, it will be difficult to control Modi
 haarane ke baad ye log bolnaa chaalu karenge
 i really want to know about those people who are now planning to control Modi while in BJP
 aise saahsee or dilachasp logon se milane kaa anubhav kaaphi romchank ho saktaa he
 Big journalists should tell the names and faces of these brave people
 ye koun hai or kiske netritv main bijepi main modi or shah kii jodi ko chunauti dene vaale hai
 Are they going to proceed under the leadership of Shatrughan Sinha
 main yah nahin kah rahaa ki kabhi modi or shah yug kaa prabhaav kamazor nahin hoga lekin wo bihar haarate hi ho jayega isaki koi thos daleel to saamne rakhen

 Accordingly, Rahul Gandhi should conduct twenty-two rallies and thirty-thirty padayatras in every assembly
 jo jeeta hua he us par jeetne kaa dabaav he or jo haara hua he us jeetne kaa dabaav nahin he, ye koun si raajnneetik charchaa he
 The comments jab dilli haarane ke baad pradhanmantri ke rajnatik hausale par koi asar nahin padaa to bihar ke baad kya ho jane vaala he
 Well, Bihar cannot be compared to Delhi, but what a shock it is to lose to a novice leader in his youth
 abhi tak jitna dekha or janaa he pradhanmantri har chunaav ko gambhirtha se ladate hai
 This is his own nature
 thik he ki vyapam or lalit modi prakaran par kuch bol nahin paae
 It is okay that they are unable to speak on inflation, but even then they go out among the public
 jo bolnaa hota he bol aate hai
 It tells to what extent Narendra Modi is a political animal

 If they can tweet on the municipal election, then Rahul Gandhi should go for a walk in the municipal election
 beshak bihar kaa chunaav raajnneetik rup se mahatvapurn he
 We should also understand that the 2014 mandate is for 2019
 bihar vidhansabha chunaav tak ke liye nahin he
 Election for political discourse is nothing short of fair
 ve bihar jeet kar lautate hi ye likhane lagenge ki bihar aasaan tha, ab upi jeet kar dikhaayenge
 Will Modi repeat the success of winning 70 seats in Lok Sabha in UP
 he mere bijepi ke bheetar modi virodhiyon, wo zamana chalaa gaya ki senapati telugana kii seemaa par yuddh karne gaya he or aap baghaavat kar dilli kii sultanate par kabza kar loge
 And even if you do, do not do your politics through journalists
 kya ham or aap maan len ki dilli chunaav haarane ke baad pradhanmantri kaa loksabhaa vaala janadesh kam ho gaya he
 Has his ability to make decisions come down
 dilli chunaav ke vakt bhi kaha gaya ki unke ecchhatra netritv ke kaaran party ke netaa naaraaz hai
 Saying all this somewhere that he was not nervous that he brought Kiran Bedi to the ground overnight
 dilli ko loksabhaa samaj reliyaan karne lage
 Even after this, what happened if you lost? kya sarkaar tab nahin chali thi yaa ab nahin chal rahi he
 Till now it had been read that one election does not affect the other
 har chunaav pehle ke chunaav se alag hota he
 It is different even when the same party is winning every election
 vidhansabha kaa asar na to loksabhaa par padataa he or na loksabhaa kaa vidhansabha par
 One thing is said that the party that wins the Lok Sabha wins some elections in the vicinity
 khaskar upachunaav
 But remember the bypolls in UP and Bihar soon after the Lok Sabha
 bijepi kaa pradarshan acha nahin rahaa
 At the same time, people said that the Modi wave has ended
 phir kuch samay baad usee bihar ke upachunaavon main bijepi kaa pradarshan acha rahaa to ab nitish maanane ko taiyaar nahin hue ki ve haar gaye hai
 Every win is different in itself
 main samajhnaa chahta hum ki pradhanmantri modi ke liye bihar ko kyon itnaa bada maanak banaaya ja rahaa he
 Suppose if the BJP loses, will it take away the 2014 mandate from them
 kya ve istipha de denge
 Do they not deal with Nitish Kumar as the Chief Minister at the Prime Minister's residence yet? karte hi hai
 Someone will tell what will happen
 kai dinon se soch rahaa hum ki agar bijepi haar gai to kya hoga or jeet gai to kya ho jayega
 The senior journalists who have been the last professors of politics argue that there is a niche within the party that is waiting for defeat
 is keme kaa maananaa he ki bihar jeetne ke baad modi ko niyantrit karnaa mushkil ho jayega
 After losing, these people will start speaking
 main vaaki un logon ke bare main jaananaa chahta hum jo bijepi main rahete hue ab modi ko niyantrit karne kaa plan kar rahe hai
 The experience of meeting such courageous and interesting people can be quite romantic
 bade patrakaron ko in bahaduron kaa naam or cheharaa kuch to bataanaa chahie
 Who are these and under whose leadership are they going to challenge the modi-shah duo in the BJP? kya ye shatrughan sinha ke netritv main aage badhane vaale hai
 i am not saying that the influence of Modi and Shah era will never be weakened, but that Bihar will be defeated soon, let us put forward a strong argument
 aise kyon kaha ja rahaa he ki bihar main haarate hi pradhanmantri modi or adhyaksh amit shah istipha dekar nepal chale jaaenge
 If those who wanted to lose were confident of their ability then why did Delhi lose the chance after the election
 dilli main to bijepi kii loksabhaa main congress se bhi buree haar hui thi
 What can be more concrete proof that Modi wave has ended than winning just three seats out of 70
 maan lijie ki bihar main bijepi jeet jaati he to kya party ke bheetar modi virdohi khemaa congress main shaamil ho jayega
 If this is the case then why Modi and Shah's pair will perform their aarti after winning
 bhai aap hamaare hi saath raho bengal kaa chunaav aa rahaa he ab uskaa intazaar karo
 Another argument is being made that winning the election of Bihar is necessary for a majority in the Rajya Sabha
 rajyasabha ke ganit ke hisaab se bihar jeetne ke baad bhi 2016 tak bijepi ko rajyasabha main bahumat nahin milegaa
 By 2018, she will reach near majority
 tab jab bijepi bihar ke baad bengal or upi bhi jeet le
 Accordingly, if the central government sets out on the Vijay Yatra for the assembly elections, then it will come back to Delhi by 2019
 kya janata main is baat par vot maanga jayega ki ham to ji vidhansabha jeetne main lage the
 Forgot to work in the center
 zaahir he rajyasabha ke liye bhi bihar kaa chunaav mahatvapurn nahin he
 Political arguments are becoming absurd
 madhya pradesh main nagarpalika chunaavon main jeet mili to mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ko laga ki 2014 kii modi lahar ke baad ab agar koi lahar he to shivaraj lahar he
 He declared that Vyapam is not an issue
 aise bataane lage jaise vyapam par janadesh aayaa ho
 As the people of Madhya Pradesh have said, what a great job that the seats of medical students were sold with money
 jaalsaajon ke chakkar main funskar noujvaan jail chale gaye
 There were also reports of death of some people
 wel dan
 We support you
 jabaki usee samay supreme court se vyapam ko lekar khabaren aati raheen
 Every day a new case is being reported
 ek aaropee ke puraane teble kii chaanbin kii gai to lakhon rupee ke note nikal aae
 If the mandate has come on Vyapam, then the Chief Minister should write to the Supreme Court that we have got the mandate by the Honorable Court , do not let the cbi's time be wasted on Vyapam
 vyapam kaa cese us janata ko waapas kar den jisane nagarpalika main hamen baari bahumat diya he
 Can a Chief Minister dismiss the scam charges from the mandate
 kya mukhyamantri chouhan yah chhot apane virodhiyon ko bhi denge
 The Congress did not win even after the Bhopal gas carnage accused Anderson
 jeet or haar ke baad raajnneeti samaapt nahin hoti
 It keeps going
 asli rajaneta hota he jo donon hi sthitiyon main nahin rukta he
 Bizarre analysts are not wondering what will happen to his politics if Lalu Nitish loses in Bihar
 kya unke liye ye chunaav mahatvapurn nahin hai
 Isn't it important for Rahul Gandhi and Congress
 kya rahul gandhi kaa imtahaan hone vaala he
 Even as Prime Minister, Narendra Modi has done many rallies in Bihar
 un par to 243 siton kaa bhaar he
 Rahul Gandhi has a weight of only 40 seats
 is hisaab se to rahul gandhi ko har vidhansabha main bees-bees reliyaan or tees-tees padayatraaen kerani chahie
 There is pressure to win on those who have won and there is no pressure to win on those who have lost, which is the political discussion
 tippaniyan What will happen after Bihar when the Prime Minister's political morale after losing Delhi has not been affected? thik he bihar se dilli kii tulana nahin kii ja sakati lekin apni lahar kii javaani main kisi nausikhiye netaa se haar janaa kya kam sadma he
 The Prime Minister fights every election seriously as of yet to be seen and known
 ye unki apni fitarat he
 Well, Vyapam and Lalit Modi could not speak anything on the case
 thik he ki mahangaai par kuch nahin bol paa rahe hai lekin iske baad bhi ve janata ke bich chale jate hai
 Those who have to speak, speak
 yah bataata he ki narendra modi kis had tak raajnneetik praani hai
 They do politics around the clock
 agar ve nagarpalika chunaav par twit kar sakate hai to rahul gandhi ko nagarpalika chunaav main jaakar padayatra kerani chahie
 Of course, the election of Bihar is politically important
 hamen yah bhi samajhnaa chahie ki 2014 kaa janadesh 2019 tak ke liye he
 Bihar is not even for the assembly elections
 raajnneetik charchaakaron ke liye chunaav kisi meley se kam nahin he
 As soon as he returned after winning Bihar, he would start writing that Bihar was easy, now he will show it by winning UP
 kya modi loksabhaa main 70 siten jeetne kii kamyaabi upi main doharaa paaenge
 o opponents of Modi within my BJP, the era has gone that the commander has gone to war on the border of Telangana and you will revolt and occupy the Sultanate of Delhi
 or kar bhi lenge to patrakaron ke zariye apni raajnneeti mat karo
 Till now it had been read that one election does not affect the other
 har chunaav pehle ke chunaav se alag hota he
 It is different even when the same party is winning every election
 vidhansabha kaa asar na to loksabhaa par padataa he or na loksabhaa kaa vidhansabha par
 One thing is said that the party that wins the Lok Sabha wins some elections in the vicinity
 khaskar upachunaav
 But remember the bypolls in UP and Bihar soon after the Lok Sabha
 bijepi kaa pradarshan acha nahin rahaa
 At the same time, people said that the Modi wave has ended
 phir kuch samay baad usee bihar ke upachunaavon main bijepi kaa pradarshan acha rahaa to ab nitish maanane ko taiyaar nahin hue ki ve haar gaye hai
 Every win is different in itself
 main samajhnaa chahta hum ki pradhanmantri modi ke liye bihar ko kyon itnaa bada maanak banaaya ja rahaa he
 Suppose if the BJP loses, will it take away the 2014 mandate from them
 kya ve istipha de denge
 Do they not deal with Nitish Kumar as the Chief Minister at the Prime Minister's residence yet? karte hi hai
 Someone will tell what will happen
 kai dinon se soch rahaa hum ki agar bijepi haar gai to kya hoga or jeet gai to kya ho jayega
 The senior journalists who have been the last professors of politics argue that there is a niche within the party that is waiting for defeat
 is keme kaa maananaa he ki bihar jeetne ke baad modi ko niyantrit karnaa mushkil ho jayega
 After losing, these people will start speaking
 main vaaki un logon ke bare main jaananaa chahta hum jo bijepi main rahete hue ab modi ko niyantrit karne kaa plan kar rahe hai
 The experience of meeting such courageous and interesting people can be quite romantic
 bade patrakaron ko in bahaduron kaa naam or cheharaa kuch to bataanaa chahie
 Who are these and under whose leadership are they going to challenge the modi-shah duo in the BJP? kya ye shatrughan sinha ke netritv main aage badhane vaale hai
 i am not saying that the influence of Modi and Shah era will never be weakened, but that Bihar will be defeated soon, let us put forward a strong argument
 aise kyon kaha ja rahaa he ki bihar main haarate hi pradhanmantri modi or adhyaksh amit shah istipha dekar nepal chale jaaenge
 If those who wanted to lose were confident of their ability then why did Delhi lose the chance after the election
 dilli main to bijepi kii loksabhaa main congress se bhi buree haar hui thi
 What can be more concrete proof that Modi wave has ended than winning just three seats out of 70
 maan lijie ki bihar main bijepi jeet jaati he to kya party ke bheetar modi virdohi khemaa congress main shaamil ho jayega
 If this is the case then why Modi and Shah's pair will perform their aarti after winning
 bhai aap hamaare hi saath raho bengal kaa chunaav aa rahaa he ab uskaa intazaar karo
 Another argument is being made that winning the election of Bihar is necessary for a majority in the Rajya Sabha
 rajyasabha ke ganit ke hisaab se bihar jeetne ke baad bhi 2016 tak bijepi ko rajyasabha main bahumat nahin milegaa
 By 2018, she will reach near majority
 tab jab bijepi bihar ke baad bengal or upi bhi jeet le
 Accordingly, if the central government sets out on the Vijay Yatra for the assembly elections, then it will come back to Delhi by 2019
 kya janata main is baat par vot maanga jayega ki ham to ji vidhansabha jeetne main lage the
 Forgot to work in the center
 zaahir he rajyasabha ke liye bhi bihar kaa chunaav mahatvapurn nahin he
 Political arguments are becoming absurd
 madhya pradesh main nagarpalika chunaavon main jeet mili to mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ko laga ki 2014 kii modi lahar ke baad ab agar koi lahar he to shivaraj lahar he
 He declared that Vyapam is not an issue
 aise bataane lage jaise vyapam par janadesh aayaa ho
 As the people of Madhya Pradesh have said, what a great job that the seats of medical students were sold with money
 jaalsaajon ke chakkar main funskar noujvaan jail chale gaye
 There were also reports of death of some people
 wel dan
 We support you
 jabaki usee samay supreme court se vyapam ko lekar khabaren aati raheen
 Every day a new case is being reported
 ek aaropee ke puraane teble kii chaanbin kii gai to lakhon rupee ke note nikal aae
 If the mandate on Vyapam has already arrived, then the Chief Minister should write to the Supreme Court that we have got the mandate by the Honorable Court, do not let the cbi's time be wasted on Vyapam
 vyapam kaa cese us janata ko waapas kar den jisane nagarpalika main hamen baari bahumat diya he
 Can a Chief Minister dismiss the scam charges from the mandate
 kya mukhyamantri chouhan yah chhot apane virodhiyon ko bhi denge
 The Congress did not win even after the Bhopal gas carnage accused Anderson
 jeet or haar ke baad raajnneeti samaapt nahin hoti
 It keeps going
 asli rajaneta hota he jo donon hi sthitiyon main nahin rukta he
 Bizarre analysts are not wondering what will happen to his politics if Lalu Nitish loses in Bihar
 kya unke liye ye chunaav mahatvapurn nahin hai
 Isn't it important for Rahul Gandhi and Congress
 kya rahul gandhi kaa imtahaan hone vaala he
 Even as Prime Minister, Narendra Modi has done many rallies in Bihar
 un par to 243 siton kaa bhaar he
 Rahul Gandhi has a weight of only 40 seats
 is hisaab se to rahul gandhi ko har vidhansabha main bees-bees reliyaan or tees-tees padayatraaen kerani chahie
 There is pressure to win on those who have won and there is no pressure to win on those who have lost, which is the political discussion
 tippaniyan What will happen after Bihar when the Prime Minister's political morale after losing Delhi has not been affected? thik he bihar se dilli kii tulana nahin kii ja sakati lekin apni lahar kii javaani main kisi nausikhiye netaa se haar janaa kya kam sadma he
 The Prime Minister fights every election seriously as of yet to be seen and known
 ye unki apni fitarat he
 Well, Vyapam and Lalit Modi could not speak anything on the case
 thik he ki mahangaai par kuch nahin bol paa rahe hai lekin iske baad bhi ve janata ke bich chale jate hai
 Those who have to speak, speak
 yah bataata he ki narendra modi kis had tak raajnneetik praani hai
 They do politics around the clock
 agar ve nagarpalika chunaav par twit kar sakate hai to rahul gandhi ko nagarpalika chunaav main jaakar padayatra kerani chahie

 He declared that Vyapam is not an issue
 aise bataane lage jaise vyapam par janadesh aayaa ho
 As the people of Madhya Pradesh have said, what a great job that the seats of medical students were sold with money
 jaalsaajon ke chakkar main funskar noujvaan jail chale gaye
 There were also reports of death of some people
 wel dan
 We support you
 jabaki usee samay supreme court se vyapam ko lekar khabaren aati raheen
 Every day a new case is being reported
 ek aaropee ke puraane teble kii chaanbin kii gai to lakhon rupee ke note nikal aae
 If the mandate on Vyapam has already arrived, then the Chief Minister should write to the Supreme Court that we have got the mandate by the Honorable Court, do not let the cbi's time be wasted on Vyapam
 vyapam kaa cese us janata ko waapas kar den jisane nagarpalika main hamen baari bahumat diya he
 Can a Chief Minister dismiss the scam charges from the mandate
 kya mukhyamantri chouhan yah chhot apane virodhiyon ko bhi denge
 The Congress did not win even after the Bhopal gas carnage accused Anderson
 jeet or haar ke baad raajnneeti samaapt nahin hoti
 It keeps going
 asli rajaneta hota he jo donon hi sthitiyon main nahin rukta he
 Bizarre analysts are not wondering what will happen to his politics if Lalu Nitish loses in Bihar
 kya unke liye ye chunaav mahatvapurn nahin hai
 Isn't it important for Rahul Gandhi and Congress
 kya rahul gandhi kaa imtahaan hone vaala he
 Even as Prime Minister, Narendra Modi has done many rallies in Bihar
 un par to 243 siton kaa bhaar he
 Rahul Gandhi has a weight of only 40 seats
 is hisaab se to rahul gandhi ko har vidhansabha main bees-bees reliyaan or tees-tees padayatraaen kerani chahie
 There is pressure to win on those who have won and there is no pressure to win on those who have lost, which is the political discussion
 tippaniyan What will happen after Bihar when the Prime Minister's political morale after losing Delhi has not been affected? thik he bihar se dilli kii tulana nahin kii ja sakati lekin apni lahar kii javaani main kisi nausikhiye netaa se haar janaa kya kam sadma he
 The Prime Minister fights every election seriously as of yet to be seen and known
 ye unki apni fitarat he
 Well, Vyapam and Lalit Modi could not speak anything on the case
 thik he ki mahangaai par kuch nahin bol paa rahe hai lekin iske baad bhi ve janata ke bich chale jate hai
 Those who have to speak, speak
 yah bataata he ki narendra modi kis had tak raajnneetik praani hai
 They do politics around the clock
 agar ve nagarpalika chunaav par twit kar sakate hai to rahul gandhi ko nagarpalika chunaav main jaakar padayatra kerani chahie
 Of course, the election of Bihar is politically important
 hamen yah bhi samajhnaa chahie ki 2014 kaa janadesh 2019 tak ke liye he
 Bihar is not even for the assembly elections
 raajnneetik charchaakaron ke liye chunaav kisi meley se kam nahin he
 As soon as he returned after winning Bihar, he would start writing that Bihar was easy, now he will show it by winning UP
 kya modi loksabhaa main 70 siten jeetne kii kamyaabi upi main doharaa paaenge
 o opponents of Modi within my BJP, the era has gone that the commander has gone to war on the border of Telangana and you will revolt and occupy the Sultanate of Delhi
 or kar bhi lenge to patrakaron ke zariye apni raajnneeti mat karo

 or kar bhi lenge to patrakaron ke zariye apni raajnneeti mat karo
 Politics does not end after victory and defeat
 yah chalati rahati he
 There is a real politician who does not stop in both situations
 vicitra vishleshankarta yah nahin soch rahe hai ki agar lalu nitish bihar main haar gaye to unki raajnneeti kaa kya hoga
 Are these elections not important for him? kya rahul gandhi or congress ke liye mahatvapurn nahin he
 Is Rahul Gandhi going to test? pradhanmantri hokar bhi narendra modi bihar me kai reliyaan kar chuke hai
 They have a weight of 243 seats
 rahul gandhi par to 40 siton kaa hi bhaar he
 Accordingly, Rahul Gandhi should conduct twenty-two rallies and thirty-thirty padayatras in every assembly
 jo jeeta hua he us par jeetne kaa dabaav he or jo haara hua he us jeetne kaa dabaav nahin he, ye koun si raajnneetik charchaa he
 The comments jab dilli haarane ke baad pradhanmantri ke rajnatik hausale par koi asar nahin padaa to bihar ke baad kya ho jane vaala he
 Well, Bihar cannot be compared to Delhi, but what a shock it is to lose to a novice leader in his youth
 abhi tak jitna dekha or janaa he pradhanmantri har chunaav ko gambhirtha se ladate hai
 This is his own nature
 thik he ki vyapam or lalit modi prakaran par kuch bol nahin paae
 It is okay that they are unable to speak on inflation, but even then they go out among the public
 jo bolnaa hota he bol aate hai
 It tells to what extent Narendra Modi is a political animal
 ve choubees ghante raajnneeti karte hai
 If they can tweet on the municipal election, then Rahul Gandhi should go for a walk in the municipal election
 beshak bihar kaa chunaav raajnneetik rup se mahatvapurn he
 We should also understand that the 2014 mandate is for 2019
 bihar vidhansabha chunaav tak ke liye nahin he
 Election for political discourse is nothing short of fair
 ve bihar jeet kar lautate hi ye likhane lagenge ki bihar aasaan tha, ab upi jeet kar dikhaayenge
 Will Modi repeat the success of winning 70 seats in Lok Sabha in UP
 he mere bijepi ke bheetar modi virodhiyon, wo zamana chalaa gaya ki senapati telugana kii seemaa par yuddh karne gaya he or aap baghaavat kar dilli kii sultanate par kabza kar loge

 ye shabd mexico ke ek kasbe main rahane vaale ek shaks ke hai
 He said this to the media, referring to the things that happened during a cyclonic storm that came as a shock
 aap video main khud dekh sakate hai ki kis tarah se tufaan upar se ghumad rahaa tha or tej hawaaen gharon kii chhaton ko uda rahi thim
 An occasion also came when a group of brown clouds roamed the middle of the town
 pehle se chal rahi tej hawaaen or tej ho gayi or yah najaara kisi ko bhi daraane ke liye kaaphi tha
 As the storm was rising, it was also causing havoc
 hawaaon ke saathi hi gharon kii chhaten ke dhahne or chizon kii girane kii awaaje aa rahi thim
 The entire town was filled with dust
 mili jaankaree ke mutabik tufaan ne ilaake main baari tabaahi machaai he or sampatti ko acha-khaasaa nuksaan pahunchaa he
 However, no casualty has been reported yet
 jaise-jaise tufaan bad rahaa tha vah tabaahi bhi machaa rahaa tha
 It was the companions of the wind that the roofs of houses collapsed and things were falling
 puure kasbaa dhul se bhar gaya tha
 According to the information received, the storm has caused great destruction in the area and has caused significant damage to property
 haalanki abhi tak kisi ke hataahat hone kii khabar nahin he
 The tension between the Aam Aadmi Party and MLA Alka Lamba has increased before the Lok Sabha elections
 taaja maamla alka lamba ke vidhansabha kshetra chandani chowk main hone vaali mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal kii jansabha se judaa he
 Actually on Wednesday, Delhi Chief Minister and Aam Aadmi Party's national convenor Arvind Kejriwal is to hold an election rally in the Jama Masjid area of chandni Chowk, but the MLA of the area Alka Lamba says that he has no information about this public meeting of Kejriwal
 naaraaz aap vidhayak alka lamba ne ek bayaan jari kar kaha ki '20 farvari ko meri vidhansabha chandani chowk, jama masjid get nambar 1 par mukhyamantri jansabha karne aa rahe hai, jisaki mujhe koi khabar nahin he
 Even the party has removed the old face from the field for the year 2020, while as an MLA, i am still actively working among the people and taking forward the development work
 mujhe kamazor karke party ko kya laabh hoga? aarope mujh par lagaaye ja rahe hai ki main congress main ja sakati hum, jabaki congress se gathbandhan main koi or hi kisi bhi str par samjhauta karne ko taiyaar baitha he
 
 jo sabake saamne bhi he
 The people have chosen me, i will continue my work while remaining dedicated to the people '
 aapako bataa den ki aam aadmi party or vidhayak alka lamba ke bich matbhed beete 2 maheenon se lagaataar banahuahai
 In late December, a resolution was passed in the Delhi Assembly to withdraw the Bharat Ratna from former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi
 aam aadmi party sutron kaa kahana he ki vidhayak alka lamba ne dilli congress ke ek netaa ke kehane par yah prastaav bina party kii sahmati ke somnath bharti ke jariye 1984 hinsa sambandhit mul prastaav main shaamil karavaaya, jisase party kii fajihat hui
 However, nothing has been formally said about Alka Lamba on behalf of the Aam Aadmi Party
 jabaki alka lamba kaa tabhi se ye kahana he ki 'maine is prastaav kaa virodh kiya tha or sadan se baahar chali gai thi'
 It was also evident in the recording of the Delhi Legislative Assembly that Tilak Nagar MLA General Singh of the party read the motion while Alka Lamba walked out of the House
 is maamle se aam aadmi party kii jo fajihat or kirakiri hui usase naaraaz mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne alka lamba ko istifa dene tak ko kah daalaa tha, haalanki phir party ke duusare netaaon ke bichbachaav ke baad maamla kuch shant hua tha
 But after this case, Alka Lamba also raised questions that the party has expelled her from the whatsapp group and Arvind Kejriwal has also stopped following her on Twitter
 aise main party unako lekar apana rukh saafe kare, lekin party ne alka lambako lekar philhal aupchaarik rup se chuppi sadhi hui he

 Ravi Shankar Prasad's Varkanoon Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad attacked the Congress fiercely
 unhone kaha ki congress party pehle se hi nyaaypalika main dakhal dene kaa kaam karti rahi he
 He said that it has been in the history of Congress to tarnish the dignity of judges and judiciary
 phir chaahe vah justise hegade, justise shelat or justise grover kaa hi maamla kyon naa ho
 Ravi Shankar Prasad said that Judge HR Khanna, who gave the verdict during the Emergency, had turned down the post of Chief Justice
 vahiin indira gandhi ne immergency kaa faisla bhi unke nirnay ke baad hi liya tha
 He said that in today's government there are also Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Rajnath Singh, Arun Jaitley, Sushma Swaraj and myself who fought during the Emergency

 Modi's government was attacked even after Joseph's name was not approved
 congress netaa kapil sibbal ne kaha ki ham lagaataar kah rahe hai ki nyaaypalika khatre main he
 The law says that the collegium of the Supreme Court says it will be the same, while the government wants that if they do not agree, the collegium will ignore the recommendations and will not approve it
 kapil sibbal ne kaha ki bijepi kahati he ki desh badal rahaa he, lekin ham kehete hai ki desh badal chukaa he
 The whole country knows the way the government is treating the judiciary today
 sarkaar kii manshaa saaf he ki vah justise joseph ko jaj nahin banane denge
 Sibal said that the government does not want to run according to the collegium
 sarkaar apane rukh par barkaraarkentre sarkaar main sutron kii maane to sarkaar kii taraf se supreme court main kaha gaya he ki jab kisi kaa naam waapas kar diya gaya he to uski niyukti kaise ho sakati he

 On the other hand, it has been said by the Chief Justice that it is unthinkable to give stay warrant on the appointment of a judge
 supreme court ne kaha he ki abhi puraa process hone diya jaae, colegium ke jariye puri prakriya hogi

 The Aam Aadmi Party government of Delhi is angry at the delay in the appointment of its two new ministers
 dilli ke dipti siem manish sisodiya ne press conference kar kaha ki "6 may ko alji ko do mantriyon kii niyukti ke liye patr bhej diya tha, lekin centre sarkaar ne ab tak manjuuri nahi di he"
 The comments sisodiya ne kaha ki centre sarkaar aisa kis kanoon ke tahat kar rahi he, ye samaj se pare he, kyonki mantri niyukt karnaa mukhyamantri kaa adhikaar he or itihaas main shaayad pehali baar itani der ho rahi he

 The term 'cage parrot' for the CBI was used by the Supreme Court during the UPA regime

 Kapil Sibal tweeted on Alok Verma's removal from the post of director, "by removing Alok Verma, the committee has confirmed that the parrot of the cage could disturb the corridors of power with his voice
 isi vajah se pinjre ke tote ko phir se pinjade main bheja gaya
 On Thursday itself, the committee headed by the Prime Minister has removed Verma from the post of Director of CBI and appointed Director General of Fire Services and Home Guard Department

 However, even after that, the committee approved the decision to remove Verma from 2-1
 isse pehle mangalvaar ko supreme court ne alok verma ko sibiai nideshak ke pad par behaal kar diya tha
 On the recommendation of the CVC, Alok Verma was sent forcibly on leave by the government about two months ago
 alok verma ko sibiai pramukh ke pad se hataae jane par congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne bhi twit kiya tha
 Taking a dig at PM Modi, he wrote, 'now fear is on Mr

 Following the increasing cases of dengue in Delhi, the MCD is now adopting an environmental friendly method to eradicate dengue larvae
 emsidi ke mutabik puraane tareekon se swasthya or paryaavaran par pratikul prabhaav padataa he or isliye ek aisa tarika apanaaya ja rahaa he jo paryaavaran ke anukool ho
 MCD has taken a new initiative to eradicate dengue larvae
 yamuna kinare kii jhaadiyon se emsidi dhund-dhund kar larva jamaa kar rahi he
 In fact, Delhi Mendengoo cases have reached 50 and in July alone, after 22 cases, the corporation swung into action and campaigned extensively to eradicate the dengue larvae along the Yamuna
 is dauraan bade-bade jaalon se nadi kinare ke pani se larva ikaitha kiye gaye or phir unhen duusari jagah par le jaakar dafnaaya gaya
 Riding on a boat, the team of MCD picks up the larvae along the Yamuna shore first by traps from the river bank and then they are put into drums and put in the pre-made pit
 gauratlab he ki yamuna kinare baari taadaad main ugi jhaadiyon ke neeche machhar andey dete hai, jiske baad vaataavaran main umas badhane ke saath hi in andon se machhar ban puri dilli mendengue kii dahshatfail jaati he or yahi vajah he ki emsidi kii team yamuna main jaakar larva ko pakad rahi he
 This is also being done because if chemical is used to kill the larvae that are growing in the river, then they can prove fatal for the small fish that are growing in the river
 aapako bataa den ki dilli main abtak dengue ke kul 50 maamle saamne aa chuke hai jiske baad teenon emsidi ne yamuna nadi ke kinaaron par isi tarah kaa abhiyaan chalaaya tha taakilakhon-karodonki taadaad main punap rahe larva kaa machhar banane se pehle hi khaatmaa kiya ja sake
 The land of Deoband in western UP is decorated with red, blue and green flags with a mission to defeat the saffron party in the 2019 political battle
 navaratri ke mausam main mayawati, akhilesh yadav or ajit singh ne mahagathbandhan kii pehali saajha raily ke liye duniya ke sabase bade islamic centre main shumaar devband ko chunaa he, jo chunavi lihaaj se behad mahatvapurn mana ja rahaa he
 The SP-BSP-RLD alliance aims to show its solidarity through this rally, while Dalits, Muslims and Jats are also to bring together the biggest decisive vote banks for the alliance in West UP
 pashchim kii siton kaa centrepashchim upi kii 8 loksabhaa siton ke liye 11 april ko vot daale jaaenge
 For the first phase, the three coalition leaders are the only joint rally
 aise main teenon netaaon ne aise jagah se raily ko sambodhit karne ke liye chunaa he ki ek saath pashchim kii kareeb 5 loksabhaa siton ke matadaataaon ko saadhaa ja sake
 Deoband is one such center with a strategy to focus Saharanpur as well as Kairana, Muzaffarnagar, Baghpat and Bijnor Lok Sabha seats simultaneously
 musalamaanon kaa sabase bada centresaal 1866 main daarul-ulum ke rup main devband main ek madrasa (islamic skool) sthapit kiya gaya, jo aaj duniya ke sabase bade islamic shikshan centre ke rup main apni pahchaan rakhata he
 Deoband is also considered as the biggest center of the politics of the country's Muslims
 haalanki, aupchaarik taur par daarul-ulum se kisi party ke paksh main samarthan dene kaa elaan nahin kiya jaataa he, lekin vahaan se nikalne vaale kisi bhi sandesh ke bade myne hote hai
 In such a situation, the SP-BSP wants to give a big message from the platform of Deoband, which has forgotten the old feud to overthrow the Bharatiya Janata Party government from the Center
 varisht patrkaar yusuf ansaari kaa kahana he ki devband kii dharti se sapa-basapa khaskar muslim matadaataaon tak ye sandesh pahunchaana chaahate hai ki bijepi ko haraane main gathbandhan hi sakasham he
 In such a situation, Congress should be supported in favor of coalition by not voting
 muslim beltpaschim uttar pradesh ko soobe kii sabase badi muslim belt ke rup main bhi janaa jaataa he
 Saharanpur, Muzaffarnagar, Meerut, Bijnor, Amroha, Bulandshahar and Moradabad are the districts where Muslim voters are in a decisive role
 pehle charan ke tahat jin aath siton par matdaan ho rahaa he, un loksabhaa kshetron main muslim matadaataaon kii sankhya ausatan 25 fisadi se zyada he
 Muslims are 26 in Kairana seat, 31 in Meerut seat, 20 in Baghpat seat, 31 in Muzaffarnagar seat, 38 in Saharanpur seat, 19 in Ghaziabad seat and about 38% in Bijnor seat
 jabaki gautamabuddhanagar seat par 14 fisadi muslim matadaata hai
 In Deoband Tehsil alone, about 40 percent Muslims are there, whereas 25 percent Dalit population is here
 yani pehle charan kii sabhi siton par musalmaan vot ahm bhoomika main he, jahaan saharanpur main sabase zyada muslim voter hai
 The Muslim voters of the first phase are especially Sunni Muslims, whose Islamic center is also Deoband
 gathbandhan dalon ke kaaryakartaaon ko ekajute karnacongress ko gathbandhan se baahar rakhkar narendra modi ke khilaaf mayawati-akhilesh yadav or ajit singh hunkaar bhar rahe hai
 The BJP is calling the alliance of these parties a great disaster
 ek satya ye bhi he ki teenon dalon kaa vot bank ab tak ek-duusare kaa dhur virdohi rahaa he
 In West Uttar Pradesh, which has Jat, Gujjar, Muslim and Dalit voters, the SP has been getting great support from Muslims, while the BSP has also won from the dalit-muslim alliance, while the rld's base has been the Jat vote
 saamaajik taur par jat or daliton ke bich bada takaraav dekhne ko miltaa rahaa he
 The 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots have created a huge gap between Muslims and Jats
 aise main in teenon dalon ke liye apane-apane votbank ke saath party kaaryakartaaon ko bhi gile-shikave bhulaakar ek saath laana badi chunauti he
 There is a large number of Dalit Muslims in Saharanpur who are believed to be trying to practice through a common rally of Deoband
 daliton par mayawati kii najar2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main narendra modi ke netritv main jab bijepi ko prachand bahumat mila or upi kii 71 siton par usne fatah pai
 The assessment of the results revealed the fact that Dalits had more votes than expected for BJP, due to which the BSP could not win a single seat
 vidhansabha chunaav main bhi bispi ko bada jhatka laga
 After this, in May 2017, the violence between Dalits and Rajputs in Shabbirpur became the subject of nationwide discussion
 is hinsa se bhim army netaa chandrashekhar ek bada cheharaa banakar ubhare hai, haalanki mayawati saarvanajanik taur par unhen nakaarti rahi hai
 Even before the shared rally, Chandrasekhar questioned Akhilesh Yadav on the pretext of the Chamar Regiment
 dilachasp baat ye he ki shabbirpur devband vidhansabha kshetra main hi aata he
 Mayawati reached here after the violence, although she was not allowed to go to Shabbirpur
 aise main ek baar phir mayawati devband ke manch se shabbirpur main daliton par hue atyaachaar ko mudda banaakar bijepi ko aasaani se gher sakati hai
 Saharanpur is the name of number one in the list of BJP Lok Sabha seats won in Lok Sabha and Assembly
 musalamaanon or daliton kii badi aabaadi hone ke baavjood saharanpur loksabhaa seat par 2014 main bijepi ke raghav lakhanpal ne jeet darj kii thi
 However, the margin of his victory was small
 lakhanpal ne congress pratyaashee imran masood ko kareeb 65 hajaar maton se haraaya tha
 While Jagdish Singh Rana of BSP got about 2 lakh 35 thousand votes
 chauthe number sapa ke tikat par lade imran masood ke chachere bhai shajaan masood ko 52 hajaar vot mili the
 Now the SP BSP is with them, but Imran Masood is showing strength once again on the Congress ticket
 isi tarah 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav main devband vidhansabha seat par basapa-sapa ummidavaar kii takkar main bijepi ke brijesh ne baaji maari thi
 Congress president Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi can also rally in Saharanpur
 aise main is seat par muslim matadaataaon ko congress ke bajaay gathbandhan kii ore puri tarah aakarshith karne ke makasad bhi devband se chunaav prachaar kaa aagaaj karnaa badi vajah mana ja rahaa he
 In this way, through Deoband, the coalition does not want to give a big message by bringing Dalits and Muslims together only in Saharanpur seat, but it wants to give a big message from all over the state
 khaskar, pehle teen charnon main pashchim upi kii siton par jahaan muslim vot nirnaayak bhoomika hai, vahaan is raily kaa vyapak asar dekhne ko mil saktaa he

 ’ The political battle for the Lok Sabha election 2019 is on, with Rahul Gandhi's statement that Tejashwi Yadav is constantly attacking him against Sushil Modi's threat of defamation

 Tejashwi's statement is also understood to be a gesture towards PM Modi
 tejasvi ne ek baad ek kai twit kar susheel modi par hamalaa bolaa
 At the same time, he also attacked Nitish Kumar and said that in Bihar, the real birthright of the Sangh is Nitish Kumar
 tejasvi yadav ne susheel modi par nishaanaa sadhate hue sabase pehle twit kiya - desh kaa lakhon karod rupaya lutaakar bhagane vaale or lootakar bhaagane vaale ek hi 'varna or jaat-birdari ke hai
 There is not a single Dalit-backward, tribal and Muslim among these fugitive dacoits and thieves

 The culmination of mental bankruptcy is saying that Lalu has met Sangh

 Finding some other excuse, in the series of tweet by Rafael Chor's Gotiya Bhai Srjjan Chor! adwani ji ko nakel daal unki unmaadi yatra ko roka
 Not a single riot was allowed in 15 years! Khandani chor sahib, people are laughing at your foolish absurdity in spite of defeat
 srijan chor ji, lalu ji ne sangh kii ghrunit nafarti raajnneeti ko bihar main paanv pasaarne nahin diya
 Advani ji was pulled out and stopped his frenzied journey
 15 varsh main ek bhi danga hone nahin diya! Khandani Chor sahib, people are laughing at your foolish absurdity in spite of defeat
 rajd netaa tejasvi ne nitish kumaar par bhi prahaar kiya
 He wrote - Nitishji is drinking milk lying in the lap of the Sangh
 bihar main sangh ke asal janmdata nitish ji hai
 When the Sanghis stopped feeding them after 6 months of inversion, then they wanted to come to Lalu ji's shelter

 Sanjay Dutt, ie Kabir, is a fraudster, who has escaped with money by making these four owls and living the life of Aishoram
 chaaron apane saath hui dhokhadhadi kaa badla lene kabir ke paas pahunch jate hai, or phir shuru hota he ek-duusare ko bevakoof banane kaa silsilaa
 The characters of director Indrakumar's 'double Dhamaal' are actually like the characters in cartoon films, who chase each other, clap them, squeeze their nose, mouths, mimic film stars, But still we do not laugh
 film ke boring first half ne mere sabar kaa kaaphi imtihaan le liya tha, so, jaise-taise second half dekhne kii himmat jutai, or shukr he, yahaan diarector ne film thodi-bahut sambhaal lee
 There are some good comic scenes of characters fighting gorillas and playing golf
 'pipli live', 'taare zameen par', 'kits' or 'guzarish' jaisi dheron filmon kaa khub achche se mazaaq udaaya gaya, haalanki ant main film phir boring ho gai
 Mallika Sherawat's specialization is in some other types of films, so it is not uncommon for her to be sidelined by having one or two dance numbers, but she is moved to waste Arshad Warsi and Javed Jaffrey
 secretary ke role main kangana se bhi behatar kaam karaayaa ja saktaa tha
 Ashish Chaudhary does not even get dressed in the guise of a girl
 'dabl dhamal' mindles kamedi he, jisamen kahani naam kii koi chiz he hi nahin
 
 
 'double Dhamaal' is a sequel to 'dhamaal', released about four years ago, but seeing its lousy comedy, it would have to be called 'half Dhamaal'

 RSS Sarsanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat came to the Dinanath Mangeshkar Hospital in Pune as the chief guest at a function on Thursday evening
 apane bhaashan main mohan bhagwat ne desh main swasthya seva or shikshan seva bina vyapareekaran kiye saamaanya janata tak pahunchaana kitna jaruri or shikshit logon kaa kartavya he, is vishay par bole
 Without naming anyone, Bhagwat said, "any Indian citizen goes to Pardesh and if the people there honor him, then 50% contribution of India is always there, and who should not forget it
" aadmi kitna bhi kaabil kyon naa ho pardesh main sammanit hone main 50% yogadan apane desh kaa hi hota he
 "he further said," a man born in this country who earns respect by going to any corner of the world, should never think that my country has no contribution to earn this respect
 ye aap ganth baandh lo ki is desh main janm liya hua aadmi duniya main kahin bhi izzat kamata he to kehane kaa taatpary ye he ki desh kii haalat kisi bhi ho, duniya ke kisi bhi kone main us aadmi ke izzat kamaane main 50% yogadan isi desh kaa hi hota he
 The respect we get all over the world is not only given to us by our work, we also get that respect because of our country
 "apni baat kaa spashtikaran dete hue aresas sarasanghachaalak mohan bhagwat ne desh ke us samay ke janemaane suprasiddh sahityakar purushottam lakshmana deshpandey kaa 1962 kaa america daure kaa vaakya bataaya, vaakya china ke saath yuddh haare bharat kaa tha
 At that time, the joke on Prime Minister Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru in America had to be tolerated
 american mimicri artist rone kii nakal karte hue stage par aayaa or nehru kii nakal karte hue kaha, "kennedy ankal kennedy ankal us maao ko bataao wo bahut pareshaan kar rahaa he
 "mohan Bhagwat said that Deshpande could have given an answer if he wanted, but considering the condition of the country at that time, he thought it better to keep quiet
 agar us samay deshpandey kisi or desh main gaye hote to swami vivekanand ke desh se aae hue vyakti ko unke gun-avagun dekhe bagaiyr sammaan miltaa or maan diya gaya hota
 Recently a friend of mine went to China
 vahaan ek mandir tha to wo meraa dost us mandir main gaya
 There were candles lit in the temple
 vahaan ek mahila khadi thi, us mahila ko disturb naa karte hue meraa dost aage jaakar khadaa rahaa, namaskara kiya or lautakar aane laga to us mahila ne us bhartiya se poocha ki kya aap hindu ho, or mere dost ne haa kaha to- turant us mahila ne mere dost ko sheesh jhukaakar, neeche jhukkar namaskara kiya
 The woman did not ask anything else, the Hindu came from Hindustan and immediately greeted her
 to ye apni pahchaan, apane desh kaa naata, sadaiv hamaare saath hoti he or us naate kaa parinaam hota hi he
 So we should remain authentic with that identity
 bhagwat ke mutabik hindustan kaa naagarik shikshan or swasthya ko sabase zyada mahatva detaa haiaaj sarkari aspataal main opershan kii suvidha hone ke baavjood saamaanya aadmi ko sarkari aspataal or vahaan ke swasthya seva par vishwaas nahin he or shaayad isiilie saamaanya aadmi uskaa ghar-dwaar bechakar ek privet hospital main oparation kii jid lagaataa he
 So healthcare and education should be the cheapest in the country which should not outweigh the normal person
 lekin saamaanya aadmi is daud main ulajhata hi chalaa ja rahaa he or agar saamaanya aadmi ko is duvidha se chhutkaaraa karnaa he to koi or vikalp khoj nikaalnaa chahie
 Mohan Bhagwat said that instead of thinking of man's illness in today's race world, man has to fall ill or not to make any such arrangement
 aadmi kaa swasthya hi acha ho wo biimaar hi naa pade isliye us disha main kaam karnaa hoga, khaanaa vishmukt kaise kiya jaay is par kisi ko khoj chaanbin karnaa padegaa
 You will have to think about what the exercise will be like
 agar jarurat ke mutabik vyaayaam hota nahin he or maansik tanaav hoga tab khaanaa kaise is par sochna chahie
 What are the small things that the retaliatory power always remains to fight the disease
 aadmi khud ko beemaari se dur rakhane ke liye swayan purna ho saktaa he ki nahin
 If you ask me yes it can happen
 bhale hi main jaanwaron kaa doctor hum lekin aadamiyon ke bare main thodi bahut jaankaree he
 Mohan Bhagwat requested that in future, the common man should take care of his own health, minor illnesses from the facilities around his house, so that management should be done, but not the work of such a hospital
 But if such a hospital has made up its mind, then big hospitals like Dinanath Mangeshkar can do it
 sarasanghachaalak ne vyapareekaran karne vaale aspataalon ke kaan khinchemohan bhagwat vishisht varg ke logon or deenanath mangeshkar aspataal main trustee, or doctors se baatcheet main bole, "jo bhi unhen deenanath mangeshkar aspataal ke varisht doctors dwaara bataaya gaya to unhen ye samaj aayaa ki deenanath aspataal garibon ko seva dene main tatparta dikhaa rahaa he
 "mohan Bhagwat further said that India is a very big country
 deenanath mangeshkar aspataal jaisi acchhee swasthya seva logon tak pahunchane ke liye aise aspataal desh bhar main uplabdh karaane honge
 It would be wrong if work was done with business thinking for health and education, today there is a need of healthcare in the country at large, so people are becoming doctors but doctors should not give healthcare in view of commercialization
 swasthya seva dena doctors kaa kartavya he or wo unhen karnaa chahie bina vyapareekaran kiye
 He further said, "I am a part of the society, i am the soul of the society, i am a part of the soul of the society, i have affinity for the society
 isiilie doctor ko samaaj ke liye swasthya seva behaal kerani he
 With this idea, every person of the society will have to provide healthcare
 "aakhir mensarasanghachaalak mohan bhagwatne deenanath mangeshkar aspataal ke prati aabhaar vyakt kiye ki jaanwaron kaa doctor hote hue bhi unhen insaanon ke aspataal main mukhya atithi ke rup main aamantrit kiya or sammanit kiya

 When asked whether he deserved less credit than he deserved, Mishra said, "yes, so many things happened about the pitch and we were not given enough credit
" hamaare gharelu halaat pichley 15 saal se aise hi hai or yah aaj se nahin he
 When we went to Sri Lanka we also got a pitch taking spin there and we bowled well there
 ’spin gendbaaji se dawaab main he africa timis leg spinner ne kaha, ‘mujhe lagata he ki agarspinner acchhee gendbaaji kar rahehain to kam se kam acha pradarshan karne ke liye unki tarif kiijie
 It is not that the spinners got wickets just because of these pitches
 hamane desh ke baahar bhi acha pradarshan kiya he
 Mishra believes that due to the technique of the South African batsmen, he had to suffer losses against the spin balls
 aswin ke 24 or jadeja ke 16 viketon kii tulana main do maichon main saat wicket chatakaane vaale mishra ne kaha, ‘jaise upmahadweep se baahar jane par hamen adhik oochaal kaa saamana karnaa hota he usee tarah jab timen bharat aati hai to unhen adhik spin kaa saamana karnaa hota he
 It is a question of harmony

 He supports me the way i want him to
 ’mishra ne tisare test kii duusari pari main amala ko out kiya jiske baad dakshin africa kaa ballebaaji kram dhwast ho gaya
 The leg-spinner revealed that he had asked Kohli to give him a short spell
 mishra is baat se bhi sahamat nahin hai ki team prabandhan ko un par kam bharosa he kyonki spin tikdi main unhen aakhir main gendbaaji ke liye bulaayaa jaataa he
 He said, 'I don't think there is a lack of trust
 srilanka main kai baar mujhe pehle akraman par lagaaya gaya
 It depends on the circumstances
 haa, bangaleru main mujhe team se baahar kar diya gaya lekin main team prabandhan ke faisle se sahamat tha ki team ko ballebaaji majboot karne ke liye alrounder kii jarurat he
 "he gives his hundred percent" This Indian cricketer believes that his trust and good relationship with Ashwin and Jadeja is the key to success

 Asked if this was extra motivation for the team, Mishra said, "you don't need extra motivation while playing for India

 How to understand the mountain of Venus? - If this mountain is raised, it is good - it makes the person emotional and generous - but if it is more elevated then the person is sensual - the character of such people is weak- If this mountain is pressed then there is a physical problem - the person does not get happiness and resources in life - The attraction side of the person is very much disturbed
 a lot of lines disturb the mind on the mountain of Venus - If there is a trap on the mountain of Venus, then the person lives in absence - Sometimes despite the efforts of the person, he does not get happiness - If there is a mole on the mountain of Venus, then there is a possibility of inadvertence
 If the person crosses on this mountain, the plans of the person get messed up
 - The person has problems with the opposite sex - If there is a square on this mountain, then the chances of traveling to jail are made

 Manoviraj Khosla, one of Vijay Mallya's closest friends, is particularly angry with the media
 unhone enditivi ko bataaya ki aisa pehali baar nahin hua he ki maalya videsh gaye hon lekin is baar media ne bevajaah hi unke dost ke khilaaf muhim ched di he
 According to Khosla, Mallya was going abroad on March 2, this was known to those near him for 15 days
 aise main wo achaanak yaa chupchaap nahin bhaage
 Not only this, Khosla also assured that he will come to India soon and will repay him as far as the loan is concerned
 isse thik pehle maalya ne bhi twit kar unhen bhagoda kehane par aapatti jataai thi
 On Saturday, when asked by JDS supremo and former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda that today Mallya is in discussion everywhere for wrong reasons, does he not think that he made a mistake by supporting Vijay Mallya in Rajya Sabha election
 tippaniyan Deve Gowda's reply was that the JDS did not commit any sin by doing so because Vijay Mallya was the son of Karnataka, he was not born abroad, and Mallya's father Vittal Mallya was a reputed businessman of the country
 aise main jedies ne nirdaleey ummidavaar vijay maalya ko samarthan dekar koi paap nahin kiya
 However, Deve Gowda said that there is no doubt that Mallya made a mistake
 vahiin maalya ke mitra or fishan diziner khosla ne is baat par bhi naaraazgi jataai ki rin kii rakam ko malaya ke aishoaaraam or kharchile swabhaav se jod kar dekha ja rahaa he jo ki thik nahin
 According to Khosla, Mallya took the loan for Kingfisher Airlines and not for Ayyashi
 vijay maalya ke nazadiiki mitron main se ek manoviraj khosla media se khaasaa naaraaz hai
 He told NDTV that this is not the first time that Mallya has gone abroad, but this time the media has unnecessarily launched a campaign against his friend
 khosla ke mutabik maalya 2 march ko videsh ja rahe hai ye unke nazadikiyon ko 15 dinon se pataa tha
 In such a situation, he did not run suddenly or quietly
 itnaa hi nahin, khosla ne ye bhi bharosa dilaayaa ki wo jald hi bharat aaenge or jahaan tak karje kaa sawaal he, use maalya chuktaa zarur karenge
 Just before this, Mallya also objected to tweeting him as a fugitive
 vahiin shanivaar ko jedies supremeo or purv pradhanmantri ech di devegoda se jab ye poocha gaya ki aaj maalya galat kaarnon se har jagah charchaa main hai, aise main kya unhen lagata nahin ki vijay maalya ko rajyasabha chunaav main samarthan dekar unhone galati kii
 The comments devegoda kaa jawaab tha ki jedies ne aisa karke koi paap nahin kiya he kyonki vijay maalya karnataka ke bete hai, kahin videsh main unka janm nahin hua tha, or maalya ke pita vittal maalya desh ke pratishthit vyapaaree the
 In such a situation, the JDS committed no sin by supporting independent candidate Vijay Mallya
 haalanki devegoda kaa kahana tha ki isamen koi shaq nahin ki maalya ne galati kii he
 At the same time, Khosla, a friend and fashion designer of Mallya, also expressed displeasure that the loan amount is being linked to Malaya's luxury and expensive nature which is not right
 khosla ke mutabik maalya ne qarz kingfisher airlines ke liye liya tha ayyashi ke liye nahin
 According to Khosla, Mallya was going abroad on March 2, this was known to those near him for 15 days

 The comments devegoda kaa jawaab tha ki jedies ne aisa karke koi paap nahin kiya he kyonki vijay maalya karnataka ke bete hai, kahin videsh main unka janm nahin hua tha, or maalya ke pita vittal maalya desh ke pratishthit vyapaaree the
 In such a situation, the JDS committed no sin by supporting independent candidate Vijay Mallya
 haalanki devegoda kaa kahana tha ki isamen koi shaq nahin ki maalya ne galati kii he
 At the same time, Khosla, a friend and fashion designer of Mallya, also expressed displeasure that the loan amount is being linked to Malaya's luxury and expensive nature which is not right
 khosla ke mutabik maalya ne qarz kingfisher airlines ke liye liya tha ayyashi ke liye nahin
 Deve Gowda's reply was that the JDS did not commit any sin by doing so because Vijay Mallya was the son of Karnataka, he was not born abroad, and Mallya's father Vittal Mallya was a reputed businessman of the country
 aise main jedies ne nirdaleey ummidavaar vijay maalya ko samarthan dekar koi paap nahin kiya
 However, Deve Gowda said that there is no doubt that Mallya made a mistake
 vahiin maalya ke mitra or fishan diziner khosla ne is baat par bhi naaraazgi jataai ki rin kii rakam ko malaya ke aishoaaraam or kharchile swabhaav se jod kar dekha ja rahaa he jo ki thik nahin

 The state government said that in August 2010, criminal trials were registered against some innocent farmers in the violence that took place in the village of Tappal Jikarpur in Aligarh
 jaanch ke dauraan paaya gaya ki jila prashasan ne kisaanon ke khilaaf farji mukademe darj kara die the
 The state government said that during the investigation it was also found that in order to protect its interests, force was also used on the peacefully performing farmers

 Civil interests were violated in filing cases against the farmers and the accused suffered unnecessary torture

 During investigation, it was found that the district administration had filed fake cases against the farmers
 rajya sarkaar ne kaha ki jaanch ke dauraan yah bhi paaya ki apane hiton kii raksha ke liye shantipurvak pradasharn kar rahe kisaanon par bal kaa bhi prayog kiya gaya
 Later, criminal cases were also filed against the farmers
 kisaanon ke khilaaf mukademe darj karne main naagarik hiton kaa ulanghan kiya gaya or abhiyukton ko anaavashyak rup se pratadna kaa shikaar hona padaa
 The comments rajya sarkaar ne kaha ki jaanch main paaya gaya ki aligarh ke tappal main hue andolan main hui hinsak ghatnaayen aapraadhik hinsa kii shrenee main nahin aati hai

 Good news came from the World Bank on Tuesday for the BJP and the Narendra Modi government before the elections in Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh were completed by one year
 world bank kii ‘ease of doing business’ kii report ke mutabik bharat ne ‘vyapaar karne main aasaani’ ke maamle main pichley saal ke mukaable 30 paaydaan kii chalaang lagaai he
 India has come at number 100 in the list of 190 countries, while last year it was at number 130
 usase pichley saal bharat kii pojishan 131veen thi
 Issues like economy, demonetisation, GST, employment are more hot these days in the election campaign of two states
 vipaksh inhen lekar modi sarkaar par nishaanaa saadhane kaa koi mauka nahin chhod rahaa he
 In such a situation the BJP must have breathed a sigh of relief from this report of the World Bank
 congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi chunaav vaale rajyon main aae din jaakar logon ko samajha rahe hai ki kis tarah modi sarkaar ne notebandi or jiesti kii dohari maar se desh kii arthvaswastha ko chaupat karke rakh diya he
 Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday targeted Finance Minister Arun Jaitley to rejoice over this World Bank report
 rahul ne twit ke jariye kataaksh kiya- ‘sabko maaloom he Ease of doing business kii hakeekat lekin khud ko khush rakhane ke liye Dr
 Jaitley This idea is good
 ’ vipaksh ke aaropon or sarkaar ke daavon ke bich world bank kii ‘ease of doing business’ report ke bare main kuch baaten jaananaa jaruri he
 This report of the World Bank has nothing to do with demonetisation nor GST
 world bank har saal is report ko taiyaar karne main das paimaane par duniya ke deshon ko parakhata he jo puri duniya ke deshon par ek jaisaa lagu hoti hai
 For example, how long does it take to set up a new enterprise in a country and how easily it gets electricity for it
 notebandi sirf bharat main hui thi isliye report main iske asar ke bare main koi zikr nahin he or na hi is baat kaa akalan he ki isse bharat kii arthvyavtha par kya asar hua?jiesti beshak bharat ke aarthik sudhaaron kii disha main ek aitihaasik kadam he lekin world bank kii is report main iskaa bhi koi asar nahin he
 Because GST came into effect from 1 July and the World Bank used only the data till 1 June in preparing this report
 isliye rahul gandhi ke aaropon main kitni sachai he uske bare main kam se kam is report ke aadhaar par kuch nahin kaha ja saktaa
 It is also worth noting that in preparing such report, the World Bank does not use the official data of any country, but instead generates a report on different subjects for survey itself
 is report main duniya bhar kii ranking karne ke liye world bank ‘distance to Frontier’ ke tareeke kaa istemaal karata he
 This method means that the World Bank first finds out which country is the top in the world on the chosen ten parameters and then it is assessed how far behind the number 1 country is compared to that number 1 country
 
 jin das baton kaa akalan world bank apni report main karata he wo hai -'starting a business''dealing with Construction permits''getting credit''protecting Minority investors''paying taxes','trading across borders','enforcing contracts','resolving Insolvency'
 For example, to start a new business, only one formality has to be done in New Zealand and this work is completed in half a day
 uski tulana main is maamle main jo desh sabase peeche he vahaan 18 aupchaariktaayen puri kerani padati hai or isamen 100 din kaa samay lagata he
 In such a situation, no matter what the leaders of the opposition including Rahul Gandhi say, it is a big achievement for the Modi government because India is the only one in the big countries that has jumped 30 places within a year
 ab sawaal ye uthta he ki ye kamaal hua kaise? darasal pichley saal is ranking main sirf ek pojishan kaa sudhaar hone par modi sarkaar ko bada jhatka laga tha or pradhanmantri ne isapar naaraazgi bhi jataayi thi
 After that, the government studied those things deeply, which the World Bank included in its survey
 pehla badlaav to ye hua ki sarkaar ne world bank se kaha ki wo is survey ke liye sirf mumbai nahin balki dilli ko bhi shaamil kare jo baat maan lee gayi
 After this, the government specially tasked the officers to prepare the municipalities of Mumbai and Delhi to make the connection of electricity and water for business easy, small and completely online
 
 kai maamalon main aisi vyavastha ki gai ki agar online appelication par tay samay ke bheetar karwai nahin kii jaae to use khud ba khud anumati maan lee jaae
 The website of the concerned departments was made clean, easy to understand and computer and internet related to important works were made faster and better
 taaki online kaam karne main koi pareshni na ho
 Companies were informed about all these changes and what changes have been made to make business easier
 bharat kii rankigko is saal behatar banane main sabase zyada yogadan tex dene kaa he jisamen bharat kaa score pichley saal ke 47 ke mukaable is saal 66 ho gaya he
 But India is still much worse in terms of granting construction permits and is almost at the bottom of the 181st position
 ‘ease of doing business’ report ko lekar aane vaale saal kii rankig main bharat kii pojishan or behatar hone kii ummid he kyonki tabatak jiesti kaa asar bhi is report main shaamil hoga
 However, in the electoral environment, the World Bank report is similar to that of the BJP, as if the wish is fulfilled

 With the dismantling of Article 370, the central government's biggest challenge is to keep the situation there under control after the end of the special state status from Jammu and Kashmir
 ab khabar he ki sarkaar ne apni yojana main badlaav laate hue faisla liya he ki jammu-kashmir kii sthiti par ab srinagar se hi najar rakhi jaaegi
 According to sources, the government has decided to change its plan to keep an eye on not only the entire valley from Srinagar but also both Jammu and Ladakh regions
 mana ja rahaa he jammu-kashmir se vishesh rajya kaa darja khatm kiye jane or uskaa vibhaajan kiye jane ke baad pradarshan or anya hinsak gatividhiyaan ho sakati hai
 In such a situation, heavy security arrangements have been made there and curfew has been imposed in many areas including the valley
 ghati kaa daura kar rahe nsaisase pehle jammu-kashmir police ko mili saakshyon par adhyayan karne ke baad sarkaar ne videshi paryatakon ko vahaan se waapas bhej diya or jail main band kaidiyon ko vahaan se nikaalkar dur duusare rajyon kii jail main shift kara diya
 Meanwhile, National Security Advisor (NSA) Ajit Doval is in constant touch with several top officials of the state to take stock of the local situation
 vah lagaataar ghati kaa daura kar chuke hai
 State Chief Secretary BR Subrahmanyam and state DGP Dilbag Singh are also visiting different parts of Doval's team
 saath hi sthaneey logon se mil bhi rahe hai or unase yah bataane kii koshish kar rahe hai ki anuchhed 370 khatm hone ke baad kshetra kaa kis tarah se vikaas hoga
 On 5 August, Ajit Doval reached Srinagar just an hour after Home Minister Amit Shah neutralized Article 370
 dobhaal pehle aise rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar (enese) hai, jinhen cabinet rank hasil he
 Ajit Doval visited several areas in the valley till now
 isamen dakshin kashmir kaa wo shopiyaan kshetra bhi shaamil he jo sthaneey aatankwaadiyon kaa bada centre he
 In an effort to get closer to the people, sources in the NSA security establishment say that Ajit Doval wanted to take the field privately and take stock instead of input collected by security officials
 pichley dinon ajit dobhaal kii kashmir yatra ek soshal media sansani ban gai jab dakshin kashmir kii sadakon par logon ke saath bhojan karte hue unka video or tasviren viral ho gai thi
 Jammu, Kashmir Police, CRPF and Army these 3 forces will take care of the newly created Jammu and Kashmir Union Territory and Ladakh Union Territory
 yah nai vyavastha 31 oktober se prabhavi hogi
 The death toll of about 70 children at the BRD Medical College in Gorakhpur is yet to be resolved
 oxigen gas silendar kii kami ke kaaran bacchon ko supplai nahin mil saki, lekin sarkaar abhi bhi kuch nahin kar saki he
 Neither any FIR has been filed nor any convict has been arrested
 ab is maamle main ek nayaa khulaasa hua he
 It is being said that a day before the incident, it was clear that there was a shortage of oxygen gas cylinders
 lekin phir bhi unhen mangaya nahin gaya tha
 Authorities 350 km from Cilindergorakhpur
 dur elahabaad se mangane chaahe, kyonki yah sab ek tender prakriya ke jariye hota he
 But if the officers did not get into this affair and would have taken the cylinder from the local area, then probably the lives of about 30 children could have been saved
 adhikariyon ne elahabaad or faijabad se silendar mangaaye, jab ghatana hui to silendar raste main hi the or bachche maut se jujh rahe the
 According to a report, there have been about 500 deaths due to Japanese fever this year
 1 janvari se lekar 13 agast tak lagbhag 1208 teevr anseflitis syndrome (AES) ke cese aae, jinamein se 152 kii maut hui
 Rajbhar, the father of a child in the deaths at BRD Medical College, lodged a complaint against the state Health Minister, Medical Education Minister and Principal Health Secretary after losing his child
 lekin koi FIR darj nahin hui
 At the same time no FIR has been filed in any case, nor has any post-mortem been done
 bhrashtachar se gai bacchon kii jaanis khulaase se saaf he ki kuch adhikari apane jaan-pahchaan kii supplai companiyon ko phayda pahunchaana chaahate the
 This has been the reason that they did not take cylinders from Gorakhpur and want to get them from Allahabad or Faizabad
 yani adhikariyon kaa bhrashtachar bacchon kii maut kaa kaaran rahaa
 Earlier it was reported that due to non-payment of Rs 69 lakh, the oxygen supply firm had stopped supplying oxygen
 haalankiaspataal prashasan or upi sarkaaryah kah rahi he ki bacchon kii maut oxigen kii kami se nahin hui he
 UP Health Minister Siddharth Nath Singh said that in the month of August, more children usually die from encephalitis and these deaths are also similar
 mumbai ke getwe of india par mangalvaar ko us vakt hangaamaa much gaya jab 1 hajaar ke kai note pani main tairte dikhaai die
 In a short time a huge crowd gathered here to loot these notes
 angreji akhbaar mumbai mirar ne kolaba ke ek nivasee harichandra somar ke hawaale se likhaa he, 'maine suna ki getwe of mumbai ke pasahjaar-hajaar ke note tair rahe hai
 When i reached there, i saw many notes in the sea
 pani gaharaa nahin tha to main turant kud gaya or hajaar rupee ke do note nikaal laayaa
 i took three rounds and took three more notes
 'unhone bataaya, '5000 rupee nikaalane ke baad main dobaaraa pani main nahin gaya kyonki hai tide ke chalate pani kaa str bad gaya tha
 'till the arrival of the police, the local people picked up many notes from there
 kolaba ke ek police adhikari ne bataaya, 'hamane pani se note nikaalane vaale teen logon ko hiraasat main liya he
 He was released after taking his statement
 ' Pragya Thakur may have to apologize under the pressure of the party, but he is 100 per cent right that under a particular ideology, Godse was a patriot - according to his definition of the country, he worshiped it
 uski gandhi ji se koi nijee dushmani nahin thi
 What he taught to him by the RSS or the Hindu Mahasabha was fully implemented
 sankat yah he ki aaj jo aresas yaa usase jude sanghathan hai, unako apni vaicharikta kaa bharosa hi nahin, isliye ve godse kii tarah gandhi ko saamne se goli nahin maarthe, peeche-peeche unka vadh karte hai
 They walk with the dress of ideas, not ideas - when they reached Gandhi's school, they put on Gandhi's dress, and when they reached Ambedkar's school, they wore Ambedkar's cloak
 lekin godse labaadon vaala aadmi nahin tha
 He bought a pistol straight away, remembered his gurus and shot Gandhi
 gandhi ji agar godse kii goli khaakar bhi jivit rah gaye hote to maanate ki godse deshbhakt tha
 Just trying to convince him that what he considers a country is not a country, which he considers a religion, it is not a religion
 pragna thakur khud ko sadhvi kehane ke baavjood itani samaj nahin rakhti ki godse ke bare main aisa koi bachaav kar saken
 She also does not see that the BJP, which apologized to her, herself wants to kill Gandhi daily in one way or the other
 aaj hi bijepi ke ek kshetreey pravaktaa ne kaha ki gandhi pakistan ke rashtrapita hai
 BJP drove him out
 dilachasp yah he ki yah soch sangh parivaar ke bheetar arase se maujuud rahi he
 But perhaps a rule in the disciplined Sangh Parivar is that you do not publicly accept what you think
 godse kii shikaayat hi yahi thi ki gandhi pakistan kaa paksh lete hai
 Many anti-gandhis are asked the question, why should we call Gandhi the Father of the Nation? India has been a country for centuries before Gandhi was born
 use kisi baapu ne janm nahin diya
 At first sight this argument seems correct
 lekin gandhi ko kisne rashtrapita yaa baapu kaa darja diya? kya gandhi ne apane liye yah darja maanga tha? darasal gandhi ke virdohi maane jane vaale subhash chandra bose ne gandhi ko pehali baar rashtrapita kaha tha- yah 1944 kii baat thi
 Then why did Subhash Chandra Bose, sitting in Germany, feel that Mahatma Gandhi (the title of Mahatma was conferred on him by Rabindranath Tagore) should be called the Father of the Nation
 kyonki subhash chandra bose yah dekh paa rahe the ki puraane raag-dweshon, puraani chauhaddiyon, puraani riyasaton or puraane rajavaadon ko peeche chhodkar, parampara kii bahut sari jakadanon ko jhatak kar- azaadi kii ladaai kii kokh se jo ek nayaa bharat nikal rahaa he
 Mahatma Gandhi was shaping him
 or yah kaam ve akele nahin kar rahe the- isamen ve puure raashtra kii sarvanumati ko saath lekar chal rahe the
 When this consensus came against him, he stood on the sidelines and alone, the country was celebrating independence in Delhi, he was engaged in preventing riots in Bengal

 In fact, Gandhi's assassination was also a poignant reminder that the newly formed country has lost its father
 30 janvari 1948 kii raat jitne gharon main chulhaa nahin jala, jitne gharon main aansu nahin sookhe, unako gin lijie to aap paaenge ki aisa shok, aisa rudan sirf pita kii mrityu par sambhav he
 Fathers are not the only ones who become the means of giving birth to us, they are also those who we consider as fathers
 lekin jo rishton or mulkon ko bilkul jad vyakhya or murti tak simit rakhte hai, unako hi yah baat samaj main nahin aati ki koi vyakti kisi mulk kaa pita kaise ho saktaa he
 They do not understand that as much as in geography, countries continue to be formed in our consciousness
 yahi vyaktiyon kaa bhi sach he
 Many times the identity of individuals becomes so big in our consciousness that they become a symbol of a great value, sometimes the whole country
 rashtriya swayan sevak sangh yah baat samajhataa he ki bharat or gandhi ekaakaar ho chuke hai
 Those who talk of love to India cannot speak of hating Gandhi
 isliye uski party bijepi pragna thakur ko maafi maangane par majaboor karti he
 But the truth is that he does not love this India either
 is desh kii saanskrithik bahulata use pareshaan karti rahi he, ek daur main uske jhandon kaa teen rang use chubha karata tha
 It is the democratic compulsion of this country that it keeps its original ideas postponed and does not hesitate to chant the name from Gandhi to Ambedkar for power
 gandhi agar pita bhi hai jo zaruri nahin ki unhen puja jaae
 Good fathers are not to be worshiped, but to be reasoned
 gandhi ko pita kehane vaale subhash chandra bose unase bahut dur tak asahmat rahe
 Tagore, who called Gandhi a Mahatma, looked at the non-cooperation movement with suspicion and Gandhi had to say that the poet lives in a different world of his imagination
 gandhi ko guru maanane vaale jawaharlal nehru ne unke 'hind swaraj' se apni gahari asahmati jataai
 Later, as the Congress got away from Gandhi, she began to worship him by making his idol as if it would wash away his sins
 phir gandhi par sawaal karne kaa, gandhi se sawaal karne kaa chalan khatm hota gaya
 The Sangh Parivar was afraid of Gandhi, then he also knew that worshiping Gandhi would keep his sins hidden
 sankat yah he ki uski vaichariki se prashikshit hokar nikle log achaanak godse kii murtiyon banaate dikhte hai, kabhi use deshbhakt bataate nazar aate hai or kabhi gandhi par keechad uchhaalate milte hai
 But the fearful manner in which BJP leaders defend themselves on such antics shows how much Gandhi scares them
 sach to yah he ki yah desh gandhi kii santanon kaa he, unke maanas putron kaa he- ise godse kii aulaaden nahin badal saktin

 Former Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar, who has been in the limelight for his controversial statements, is once again in the news due to the statement made to Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 unhone kaha ki 2014 se pehle maine sochaa bhi nahin tha ki narendra modi jaisaa vyakti desh kaa pradhanmantri ban saktaa he
 Mani Shankar Aiyar, who was expelled from the Congress, said during an event held at the India International Center on Saturday, according to ANI news agency, that he never thought that a person calling Muslims as papi (puppy) would sit in the Prime Minister's chair
 ayyar ne kaha, '2014 se pehle maine nahin sochaa tha ki ek aisa mukhyamantri jo musalamaanon ko pille (kute kaa baccha) samajhataa ho, wo desh kaa netritv karegaa
 When Modi was asked if you are sad that in 2002 so many Muslims had to sacrifice their lives, they said that even if a puppy comes under the car, there is some heart injury
 'maine nahi socha tha 2014 ke pehle ki ek CM jo Musalmanon ko pilley(puppies) samajhta hai,jab poocha gaya ki aapko dukh hai kya ki itne Musalmanon ko jaan ki kurbaani deni padi 2002 mein,unhone kaha 'ek pilla bhi gaadi ke neeche aa jaaye to dil mein kuch chot lagta hai': MS Aiyarpic

 It was not thought that such a person could become the Prime Minister of the country

 i learned from him that minority communalism is better than majority communalism
 unhone hamen bataaya ki ham yaa to dharmanirpeksh ho sakate hai yaa phir desh bhi nahin ho sakate
 He further said, 'I am proud of Hindus, Buddhists, Jains, people of Christianity and i am very proud of Muslims
 muslimon ne bharat par 666 saal raaj kiya

 unhone aapako pakistan diya or aaj aap unhen lalkaar rahe hai
 'sahir Lodhi is a famous and experienced TV anchor of Pakistan
 shaayad apane anubhav se unhen andaaza ho gaya ki ye tiarapy batorne kaa acha mauka he, lihaaza wo chuke nahin
 'if we don't make the line, we don't make it, will we blame quaid-e-azam?' If we take the initiative of bribe, if brother is killed, then we will blame quaid-e-azam for this? We will accuse him of accusation, false statement, wrong style, we are so sorry
 soch kar tali bajaaie
 'anchor imparting knowledge to the whole of Pakistan on Mohammad Ali Jinnah is turning red-yellow with anger
 chehre par gusse ke artificial haav-bhav aa-ja rahe hai
 The guests are sitting quietly on the set of the live event and anchor Sahir Lodhi single-handedly looks desperate to take the TRP to new heights
 sahir lodhi kii Unscripted spich taaliyon kii gadgadaahat ke saath khatm hoti he
 But what was the head and foot of Sahir Lodhi who said so many things
 ye shaayad wo khud nahin jaanate honge
 But Anchor Sahir Lodhi was so enraged while talking about Basirpaar that even the girl was scared, she tried to explain her point
 ankar sahir lodhi agar ladki kii baat puri tarah sun lete, use bich main naa rokte to shaayad acha hota
 Later a guest sitting on the stage tried to make anchor Sahir Lodhi realize his mistake
 yani ankar sahir lodhi yaa to ladki kii baat ko samaj hi nahin paae
 Or perhaps he got a chance to increase his TRP, because there was no such challenge or challenge for Mohammad Ali Jinnah in the girl's talk
 ladki kii spich- 'koi nahin ye dekhne vaala, koi nahin ye poochne vaala ki kin haathon saunp gaye tum dil se pyaara pakistan, qaayade aazam aao zaraa tum dekho apana pakistan
 In this country, sometimes women are murdered and sometimes they are played with respect
 ' ab naa jane ankar ko ladki kii spich main kaayade ajam kii beijjati kaise mahasoos ho gai
 But to the extent that the anchor later apologized to the girl, she was also seeing her senselessness
 baad main ankar ne kaha- 'ai em sori, maine galati kii
 Will offer many things that will not be right
 kaayade ajam ko blem mat karnaa
 i can not control ' is puure live episod main ek baat to saaf he ki ankar sahir ne khud ko zyada deshbhakt dikhaane kii koshish kii he
 But her stupidity came to the fore, as the girl had not insulted quaid-e-azam while talking about the plight of women in Pakistan, but raised the voice of women suffering insults every day in Pakistan
 live tivi sho ke dauraan pakistan ke mashhoor ankar sahir lodhi ne jis tarah mohammad ali jinna ke bahaane pakistani mahilaon kii awaz dabaane kaa naatak kiya, uske baad unke sho kii tiarapy kitni badi
 It is not known
 lekin isse ek baat to acchhee hui he ki pakistan main mahilaon kii durdasha par bahes shuru ho gai he
 This is good because even today in most areas of Pakistan, women are forced to live in the Stone Age
 aankade bhi cheekh-chikhakar isaki gavaahi dete hai
 According to the report of the international body Thomson Reuters Foundation, Pakistan is the third most dangerous country in the world for women
 pakistan maanavadhikaar ayog ke mutabik pakistan main har saal 1000 se zyada ladakiyon or mahilaon ko izzat ke naam par maar daalaa jaataa he
 In Pakistan, there are incidents of acid attacks being thrown at seven hundred and fifty women every year
 pakistan main har roj 4 mahilaayein rape or gangrape kaa shikaar banati hai
 Every year in Pakistan, 800 women who commit incidents like gangrape, kidnapping, acid attack, either commit suicide or attempt suicide
 or pakistan kii 90 fisadi mahilaayein gharelu hinsa kii shikaar banati hai
 These are just the figures which are recorded in the government records
 hakeekat to ye he ki pakistan main mahilaon ko kadam-kadam par julmo-sitam, atyaachaar or apmaan ke ghunt pine padate hai
 This is the same Pakistan where religious institutions recommend to the government that if women do not listen to their husbands then laws should be made to give the husband the constitutional right to beat her
 had to ye he ki sahir lodhi jaise padhe-likhe mashhoor tivi ankar bhi kattar mullah-maulaviyon kii tarah bartaav karne lagate hai or basirpair kii baaten karke mahilaon ko unki had main rahane kii hidaayat tak de daalate hai
 Seeing these conditions of Pakistan, anyone will say
 pakistan ke kaayade ajam aao jaraa tum dekho apana pakistan
 In Bikaner district of Rajasthan, a single son stabbed his mother to death with a sharp weapon
 vaardaat ke vakt mahila ghar main akeli thi
 The police have registered a case
 dil dahala dene vaali hatya kii yah vaardaat bikaner kii jainarayan vyas colony main hui
 Thanadikari Sanjay Bothra said that 55-year-old Omvati Chaudhary used to live with her family near Gurdwara in Vyas Colony
 somvaar kii dopaher unkashwaunke kamare main padaa mila
 The deceased's husband Sajjan Singh first saw Omvati's body lying in the room
 unhone apane ek padosi ko bulaakar police ko khabar dene ke liye kaha
 On receiving the information, the police reached the spot
 police ne chaanbin main paaya ki mahila ke gale ko kaata gaya tha
 Blood was scattered in the room
 thanadhikari sanjay bothra ne bataaya ki beeti raat ko is ghatana ke vakt parivaar ke anya sadsy ghar main hi the
 The deceased's husband Sajjan Singh had first reported this to his neighbor
 usee ne police ko phone kiya
 Bothra said that on the basis of suspicion, the son of the deceased Sandeep Kadwasra has been detained on charges of murder
 jisane praathmik poochtacha main apana jurm kabool kar liya he
 Actually, he is addicted to drugs
 police ne maukey se omvati ke shav ko kabje main lekar postmortem ke liye pibiem aspataal main pahunchaaya
 After the post-mortem, the dead body has been handed over to the next of kin
 dakshin-purvi dilli ke kalkaji ilaake main 90 varsh kaa vyakti apni patni ke shav ke saath rahete hue paaya gaya
 The comments police ne aaj bataaya ki govind ram ke padosiyon ne uske ghar se durgandh aane ke baad kal raat police ko suchit kiya
 After this matter came to light
 police ke anusaar vruddh vyakti maansik rup se aswasth he or kalkaji ke apane ek room ke flats main apni patni gopi ke shav ke saath rah rahaa tha

 ) sattarudh bahujan samaaj party (basapa) kii baat ho to use har jagah nila hi nila dikhataa he
 Since the color of this party's flag is blue , it is clear that Mayawati, the president of this party and the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, would like the colors of all the other parties like Samajwadi Party (SP), Congress and BJP to be gone and blue everywhere
 Color is dominant
 unki vichaardhaara main nila rang aasmaan kaa pratik he, jo kisi jati, ling, dharm yaa amir or garib ke aadhaar par bhedbhaav nahin karata
 Therefore, officers are vying to paint the state machinery in blue color for the sycophancy of 'bahnji'
 lok nirmaan vibhaag se lekar swasthya or shahari vikaas tak tathaa nagar nigamon se lekar soochna evam prachaar vibhaag tathaa pradesh police tak, rajya kii mashinari main har jagah nila hi nila rang najar aa rahaa he
 The Public Works Department headed by Mayawati's most trusted minister, Nasimuddin, has installed blue signboards across the state and placed blue lacquer on the grills of the dividers between the newly constructed buildings and the road
 bade bazaaron or posh ilaakon ke chauraahon ko nile rang se pota ja rahaa he
 The Information and Publicity Department, which promotes the Chief Minister and creates a good image, also appears bathed in blue
 is vibhaag main har kahin nila hi nila dikhataa he
 Government annual diaries, journals, folders, roadside hoardings and banners to the invitation letters of Chief Minister related programs have been painted blue
 mukhyamantri kii rajnatik baithkon or jan sabhaaon ke nile main naha uthne kii baat to samajh main aati he, lekin sarkari kaaryakramon main bhi prabandh adhikari isi rang kaa chayan kar rahe hai
 For example, when the Chief Minister was in Delhi during the trade fair, the Uttar Pradesh pavilion had a blue carpet or when he addressed the press conference, his background was also blue
 parivahan vibhaag mukhyamantri ko khush karne ke liye ek kadam aage bad gaya he
 He is promoting the bsp's social engineering slogan Sarvajan Hitayya, Sarvajan Sukhay by stealing it on government buses and promoting it in every corner of the state
 is vibhaag ke aakaaon ne bason par to pehle hi nila rogan karvaa rakhaa he or ab un par sarvajan hitay
 
 
 Just writing the service
 do saal pehle tatkaaleen police mahanideshak vikram singh ne bhi mukhyamantri ke janmdiwas par unke sarkari awaas main media ke saamne unhen chocolati kek khilaakar khush karne main koi kasar nahin chodi thi, jis par janata ne unki khilli udayi thi
 It was during his tenure that the white-khaki uniform of the traffic police was changed to white-blue, which was similar in color to the uniform of BSP workers
 lekin mayawati ko khush karne kii unki chaal kaam nahin ai kyonki pichley saal jab kanoon-vyavastha kii sthiti bighad gai to unhen tatkaal pad se hataa diya gaya
 The new Director General of Police Karmbir Singh is also heading in the same direction
 mayawati ke sapanom kii pariyojna ambedkar park or kanshiram prerana sthal se lekar basapa sarkaar ke raaj main viksit hue maidaanon or smarakon kii raksha ke liye rajya police ne uttar pradesh vishisht parikshetra suraksha vahini naam se ek nayaa bal khadaa kiya he, jisaki vardi bhi nile rang kii he
 Just a few days ago, on the occasion of Deepawali, most IAS and PCS officers fought each other by decorating their houses with blue lights in government colonies to show loyalty to the BSP and the Chief Minister
 pehle kii sarkaron main yahi adhikari kisi bhi rang kii roshni se apane ghar sajaa liya karte the, par nile se nahin
 The residence of senior IAS officer and Additional Cabinet Secretary Netram, located on Vikramaditya Marg in Lucknow, was illuminated with blue lights
 or phir, mukhyamantri ke taur par jab mayawati apana janmdin manaati hai to sab kuch nila hi nila najar aata he
 The same color prevails in the auditorium and the officers present in front of them in blue pant-shirts
 adhinsth adhikari hi nahin, vipaksh bhi mayawati ke nile rang se vibhor he
 The most prominent among them is Pramod Tiwari, the senior Congressman and the leader of the party in the assembly, who is often seen in blue Nehru jacket with the Chief Minister in government programs
 bhaajapa ke pravaktaa or vidhaan parishad sadsy hriday narayan dikshit kehete hai, ''mujhe lagata he ki mukhyamantri mayawati ko khush karne kii khatir rajya mashinari ko nile rang main rangane ke liye adhikari doshi hai
 "last week itself, he resigned from a committee of the House to protest against the officials' behaving like BSP workers and not giving them proper accommodation"
 dikshit bujurg ho chuke hai or unki taang main chot lagi he, lekin isse bhi basapa ke vafaadaar adhikari nahin pighale
 Not only that the state machinery and BSP loyal officers are painted in the blue color of the BSP, the Mayawati government itself has used government money to install elephant statues in most of the Chief Minister's dream projects
 hathi basapa kaa chunaav chinh he
 For this reason, a PIL was filed before the Supreme Court and the Election Commission, accusing it of 'misusing' the state exchequer
 lekin party ke mahasachiv satish chand mishra is maamle main ayog ke saamne pesh hue to yah yachika khaarij kar di gai
 Officers and leaders in Uttar Pradesh have a history of sycophancy
 1980 vaale dashak kii shuruyaat main jab narayandutt tiwari mukhyamantri the to sanjay gandhi ke slipper uthaate dekhe gaye the
 He was then widely criticized for hurting the dignity of the Chief Minister's post
 yahi nahin, basapa sansthaapak kanshiram jab videsh daure par gaye the to bataaya jaataa he adhikariyon ke ek samooh ne unke paanvon main mauje pahanaae the
 Moreover, in 2007, when the SP government was celebrating three years in power, big bureaucrats were seen queuing up at the party's Lucknow headquarters
 aise main rajya ke adhikari yadi mukhyamantri ko khush karne ke liye rajya mashinari ko nile rang main rang rahe hai to isamen nai baat kya he

 in Ganesh Chaturthi festival is starting on September 2 amidst the economic slowdown in the country
 10 din tak chalane vaale is tyohaar ko deshbhar main dhoomdhaam se manaaya jaataa he, lekin is baar is tyohaar par mandi kii aahat kaa asar saaf taur par dekha ja rahaa he
 The recession is also visible on this festival
 bhagwaan ganesh kii murti banane vaale murtikaron se lekar puja ke liye bhavy pandal kaa nirmaan karaane vaale aayojak tak, sabhi pareshaan hai
 Madan Prajapati, who has been making the idols of Lord Ganesha for almost 25 years, has made around 80 sculptures this year
 kam he murtiyon kii mangamadan bataate hai ki mandi kii aahat thodi mushkilen lekar ai he
 He said that the demand for idols is less this time than in previous years
 madan iske peeche kii vajah bataate hue kah rahe hai ki kai aise log, jo pichley saal tak murtiyon le ja rahe the vah is baar kam chande kii baat karte hue murti lene aae hi nahin
 Madan says that every year people associated with many puja committees carrying idols from him have not come to him so far this year
 chande kii kami se jujh raheen samitiyanmandi ke kaaran murtiyon kii kam maang se jujh rahe murtikar madan akele nahin
 Pooja committees, which have been preparing for a long time, along with other sculptors who make the idol, are also facing a crisis
 yah sankat he chande main ai kami kaa
 Apart from this, the crisis of donations is also in front of the organizers who put up big Ganesh pandals, who are upset with the sponsors this time
 rajdhani bhopal ke new market ilaake kii mashhoor ganesh puja samiti ke logon kii maane to pichley saal ke mukaable is baar unhen chanda ikattha karne ke liye zyada mehnat kerani padi
 According to Ajay Devnani, secretary of Ganesh Utsav Samiti, the collected Chandanyu Market Merchants Federation is insufficient for the event, the amount that has come so far is not enough for the event
 unhone mana ki is saal chande ke liye unhen nai jagahon par bhi janaa padaa or sponcer ke liye pehle se zyada mehnat kerani padi
 However Ajay is confident that more sponsors will come and the event will be grand this year like every year
 rajdhani main sajte hai pratham poojya ke 20 bade pandaladarasal madhya pradesh kii rajdhani bhopal main pratham poojya bhagwaan ganesh ke kareeb 20 bade puja pandal sajte hai
 Ganesh worship is organized in many pandals even on a small level
 mandi kii aahat se is baar na keval bhopal main inaki sankhya main kami ai he, balki aayojakon ne bhi kai tarah ke kharchon main is baar katautee kar di he
 There is still a tussle between the BJP and Shiv Sena over the formation of government in Maharashtra
 bijepi vidhayak dal ne devendra fadanvis ko apana netaa chun liya he
 BJP sources are claiming that the blue print of the Maharashtra government is ready
 iske mutabik maharashtra main bijepi-shivasena kii saajha sarkaar banegi or devendra fadanvis puure 5 saal ke liye mukhyamantri rahenge
 At the same time, there can be two Deputy Chief Ministers, one of which will be of Shiv Sena and one of BJP
 sutron kaa kahana he ki shivasena kuch malaaidaar padon kii maang kar sakati he
 She can also ask for independent charge of the Minister of State at the Center
 haalanki shivasena vidhayak dal kii baithak ke baad sarkaar gathan par aupchaarik baat hogi
 Meanwhile, Shiv Sena spokesperson Sanjay Raut has tweeted in a tweet that the media reports are being misunderstood saying that the Shiv Sena has become soft
 unhone twit kiya, 'shivasena naram pad gai he
 
 
 She has retreated
 
 
 padon ko samaan rup se baanta jaae
 
 
 This demand has been abandoned
 
 
 aisa kaha ja rahaa he
 It is public, everyone knows, what has been decided will be according to that
 ' aapako bataa den ki ek din pehle hi shivasena netaa sanjay raut ne kaha tha ki maharashtra ke vyapak hit main ‘sammaan' se samjhauta kiye bagaiyr party ke liye bhaajapa nit gathbandhan main bane rahanaa jaruri he
 Raut had said that there is no hurry to form the next government
 unhone un kayaason ko khaarij kar diya ki agar nae mantriparishad ke gathan main deree hoti he to shivasena bant sakati he
 Significantly, the Uddhav Thackeray-led party is aggressively pushing for a 50:50 formula on alternating chief ministerial post and power sharing, but the BJP has rejected the demand
 raut ne kaha ki donon sahyogiyon ke bich 21 oktober ko hue vidhansabha chunaav se pehle jo tay hua tha unki party bas use hi lagu karwaanaa chaahati he
 The head constable Suresh Vats was stoned in the head
 senior police adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki unhen nahin pataa ki wo pathar kisne phenkaa tha, jisase suresh vatsa kii maut ho gai
 But it can be seen in the videos of two mobile phones that Arjun Singh Kashyap was leading the Nishad community protesting with the demand for reservation
 kashyap ghatana ke baad se faraar hai
 In a video, Kashyap can be heard saying, 'I am here to demand my community
 anya logon ne hamaare adhikaar le liye or hamen aise hi chhod diya gaya
 The police said that it was Kashyap who instigated the mob against the policemen
 senior police adhikari pivi rama shastri kaa kahana he, 'ham aapraadhik kaamon ke liye sakht dharaaen lagaayenge
 The accused will be punished severely
 isse ek majboot sandesh jayega or koi bhi pulicekarmiyon ko nuksaan pahunchane kii himmat nahin karegaa
 'let me tell you, a total of 27 people have been arrested so far in the three cases filed in this case
 sapa adhyaksh akhilesh yadav ne is ghatana ko sthaneey prashasan kii naakaami qaraar dete hue kaha he ki pradhanmantri kii raily kii vajah se prashasan or puure khufia vibhaag ko pataa tha ki kahaan par kiskaa dharna-pradarshan hone vaala he, magar iske baavjood yah dukhad ghatana ghat gayi
 However, he also said that innocent people are being harassed under the guise of this
 darasal he ki gajipur jile main pradhanmantri narendra modi kii raily main jane se roke jane se naaraaz logon dwaara kiye gaye patharav main head consteble vatsa kii mrityu ho gayi thi
 District Superintendent of Police Yashveer Singh said that the Rashtriya Nishad Party workers were prevented by the police and administration from attending the Prime Minister's rally
 isse naaraaz hokar unhone jagah-jagah rasta jam kar diya or raily se lautne vaale vaahanon par patharav kiya
 During this, head constable Suresh Vats (48), who went to open the jam, died due to stone pelting on his head

 com / watch?v=r3nhttumhri&sns=fb Indian selectors have taken a big risk by keeping Ambati Rayudu out of the number four position in most matches for the last one year
 vishwa cap team main raidu kii jagah kisi anbhavi ballebaaj kaa chayan karne ke bajaay vijay shankar jaise kam anbhavi khilaadi par vishwaas karnaa baari pad saktaa he
 a 15-member squad of India has been announced on Monday for the World Cup-2019
 bhartiya team main sheersh kram main teen ballebaajon rohit sharma, shikhar dhawan or captain viraat kohli kaa sthaan tay he, lekin chauthe number jaise najuk sthaan par team ko anbhavi ballebaaj kii kami khal sakati he
 At number four, India needed a batsman who could finish the innings and hence some former cricketers were advocating for Ajinkya Rahane to be given a chance again
 yahaan tak ki purv captain saurav ganguli ne to test visheshgy cheteshwar pujaara ke naam kii sifarish kii thi jo sheersh kram ke naakaam rahane par pari sanvaar sakate hai
 Apart from 15, these 4 players will also be given in the World Cup
 In the team that has been selected for the Dharvishwa Cup to Team India, there is every possibility that either one of the fourth number Vijay Shankar or KL Rahul will be fielded
 mahendra singh dhoni paanchaven or kedaar jadhav chathe number kii jimmedaari uthaa sakate hai
 The seventh number is important in the lower middle order, on which Hardik Pandya is set to descend
 Dinesh Karthik gets the nod over Rishabh Pant
 - Cricket World Cup (@cricketworldcup) April 15, 2019 According to cricket experts, the selectors have taken a big risk by excluding Rayudu and not picking an experienced batsman like Ajinkya Rahane in the middle order
 dekhnaa he ki yah saahasik faisla phydemand hota yaa nahin
 Former captain Krishnamachari Srikkanth had chosen one of the pure batsmen like Shreyas Iyer or Shubman Gill for this number
 kai cricket panditon kii raay main rohit, dhawan or kohli ke asafal rahane par team ko madhyakram kii kamajori baari pad sakati he
 He said, 'india's top order is very strong in the presence of Rohit, Dhawan and Kohli, but failure of these three in a match will be the real test of the middle order and in that case the team can miss the innings batsman and In this context, this move of the selectors can be called risky
 ’world cap ke liye team india kaa elaan, karthik-vijay shankar-jadeja ko maukapichley kuch varshon se bharat ne chauthe number par ambati raidu ko aajamaaya
 He has batted at number four in 14 matches in the last one year, including 42
 18 kii ausat se 464 ran banaae, lekin haal ke kharaab form unke chayan main aade aa gai
 The selectors also preferred the current form
 jab bhi chauthe number par anbhavi ballebaaj rakhane kii baat uthi, to sabase pehla naam rahane kaa saamne aayaa
 But he has not played any ODI since February 2018
 unhone jo 90 vanade khele hai unamem se 54 maichon main vah salaami ballebaaj ke rup main utre, jabaki 25 maichon main vah chauthe number par ballebaaji ke liye aae, jisamen unhone 36
 Scores were scored at an average of 65
 is lihaaj se rahane is number ke liye upyukt ho sakate the
 But in the current scenario, Shankar can be fielded at this number, who has not batted at number four even once in his brief ODI career of nine matches
 unhen haal main do maichon main paanchaven number par aajamaaya gaya, jisamen vah 62 ran hi bana paae
 Rahul has been added to the team as the third opener, but it is believed that he can be dropped at number four
 record ke liye bataa den ki rahul ne pichley ek saal main keval do maichon main is number par khele or unamem unhone sirf nau ran banaae
 Karthik, who was selected as the second wicketkeeper in the last one year, was also dropped at number four, in which he scored 122 runs
 vaise coach ravi shastri captain kohli yaa dhoni ko number chaar par utaarne ke sanket purv main de chuke hai
 Kohli has batted only once in the last one year (seven runs) and Dhoni at number four in three matches
 in maichon main dhoni ne 128 ran banaae, jisamen ek naabad 87 ranon kii pari bhi shaamil he
 BCCI said - Rishabh Pant had made a place in the WC team, due to this, Bahudhoni was scheduled to land at number five, on which he scored 361 runs in 11 matches in the last one year
 is purv captain kii behad dhimi ballebaaji haalanki pichley kuch samay se chintaa kaa vishay bani hui he
 However, at the same time, he is the strongest link in the three main places of the middle order and in such a situation, his responsibility increases not only behind the wicket but also in front of the wicket
 jadhav number chah ke liye adad ballebaaj ho sakate hai
 Jadhav, who returned after recovering from an injury, had scored 281 runs in 11 matches in the last one year, batting at number six
 paristhiti ke anusaar pandya ko bhi is number par utaara ja saktaa he
 Karthik could be a contender for this place if Jadhav is not in the playing XI

 anuchhed 370 par centre sarkaar ke samarthan main bisapicashmir main vikaas kii jataai ummidakaha khush honge buddha anuyaayi khushis faisle kaa laabh kashmiriyon ko milegaa When Rahul Gandhi will get the command of the Congress Party, this question has now gone into the womb of the past
 kyonki rahul gandhi congress ke adhyaksh ban gaye hai
 Rahul is the sixth person from the nehru-gandhi family to become the president of the Congress
 rahul gandhi se pehle motilal nehru, jawaharlal nehru, indira gandhi, rajeev gandhi or sonia gandhi ke haathon main party kii kaman rahi he
 With Rahul's coronation, Sonia Gandhi, who has been in this post for 19 years, has been relieved of responsibility
 19 saal pehle april 1998 main jab sonia gandhi ne jab congress kii kaman sanbhali, tab bhi party kii siyaasi haalat kamjor thi
 After Rajiv Gandhi's assassination in May 1991, senior Congress leaders announced Sonia to be the President of the Congress without asking her, but Sonia did not accept it and vowed never to enter politics
 sonia ne rajeev gandhi foundation kii sthapana ke saath khud raajnneeti se dur rakhane kii koshish kii
 After this, the party's worries further increased after the government of Narisamha Rao in 1996
 is chunaav main bijepi or janata dal ne baari badi hasil kii or bijepi ne gathbandhan sarkaar banaai
 Seeing the condition of the Congress getting worse day by day, Sonia Gandhi took primary membership of Congress in plenary session of Kolkata in 1997 under pressure from Congress leaders
 jiske baad april 1998 main wo congress kii adhyaksh baniin
 In this way, Sonia Gandhi, as the fifth generation of the nehru-gandhi family, assumed the responsibility of the post of Congress President
 ab jabaki rahul gandhi ko party kii kaman saunpi gai he, tab bhi congress kii haalat khasta he
 Despite forming the government in 2004 and 2009, the Congress suffered a major setback in 2014 and under the leadership of Narendra Modi, the BJP formed the government with an absolute majority
 iske baad maharashtra, haryana, upi, uttarakhand, goa, assam samet kai suubon main party ne apane dam par sarkaar banaai
 On the other hand, the Congress lost elections one after the other
 yahaan tak ki nikaay chunaavon main bhi congress apni saakh nahin bachaa paa rahi he
 In such a situation, the most challenging challenge before Rahul now is the Gujarat elections and the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 ab sawaal ye he kya rahul gandhi apni maa sonia gandhi kii tarah congress ko 2004 or 2009 jaisi jeet dilaane main kaamyaab ho paaenge? Trinamool Congress supremo and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has declared assets worth around Rs 30 lakh
