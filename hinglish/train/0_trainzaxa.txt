 gudgaanv ke jaj kii patni gitanjali ke katl kii tafteesh jaise-jaise aage bad rahi he nae-nae khulaase ho rahe hai naa sirf khulaase ho rahe hai balki gitanjali ke gharavaale jaj sahab ke khilaaf nae-nae iljaam bhi laga rahe hai vaise philhal is murder mistry ko lekar teen theory saamne aa rahi he or inhen theory ko saamne rakh kar police maamle kii jaanch kar rahi he bete kii chahat kii theory to aapako pataa hi he, jo do nai theory saamne ai he wo donon hi rishton ko lekar he jaj sahab ke bhi rishte or gitanjali ke bhi rishte
 Can someone shoot six shots without fear in the police line park? Can anyone take a loaded revolver for a walk in the park? Can anyone give their own loaded revolver to a supari killer for murder? And can a professional killer miss three targets from close range? Gitanjali was killed only in the desire of son? Or is the relationship behind the murder? Did CJM have a relationship with anyone else? Or was Geetanjali being blackmailed for the relationship? Renter shot at Geetanjali? Who knows his own shot Gitanjali? Or shot after fight? Was the killer who knew Gitanjali? Or was the murderer close to the CJM? Or was the murderer of the CJM the murderer? All these questions have confused the case
 ek jaj kii bivi ke katl ke paanch din baad bhi kaatil kaa cheharaa yaa katl kaa makasad to saamne nahin aa paaya par haa shaq main duube kya, kyon, kaise or koun ke sawaalon kii is fehrist main hi kaatilon ko dhundne kaa kaam jarur jari havaise katl ke paanchaven din ek ahm suraag or do raaj jarur saamne aae hai suraag ye ki us park se goli ke do khokhe mili hai jis park main gitanjali kaa katl hua yani khokhe se yahi sabit hota he ki katl park ke andar hi hua kahin or nahin
 The secret is that the people of Gitanjali have made a new disclosure
 khulaasa ye ki sijeem sahab kaa kisi or mahila se bhi rishta tha or doosraa raaj ye ki khud gitanjali ko koi blike mail kar rahaa tha puraane rishton ke liye or kaha ye bhi ja rahaa he ki buudhvaar ko gitanjali use se milane park main gai thi bhari hui pistal lekar
 But the two got into a fight and from the pistol Gitanjali to Gitanjali, he fired at the Gitanjali, although the Gurgaon police are currently silent on Gitanjali's old relationship or the question of blackmailing him
 ab police ke saath-saath cese kii khamoshi tabi tuutegi jab is kya, kyon, kaise or koun ke sawaalon ke jaavab milenge
 The police may be silent on the issue of blackmailing Gitanjali over the old relationship, but the family members of Gitanjali are openly speaking about the new relationship of the judge
 gitanjali ke ghar waalon kaa iljaam he ki jaj sahab kii jindagi main koi or mahila bhi he or bahut mumkin he ki usee vajah se gitanjali ko raste se hataa diya gaya
 So did Gitanjali's husband i
e
 CJM Ravneet Garg of Gurgaon's illegitimate connection became the reason for his wife's murder? Whatever the police investigation, Gitanjali's family members are also suspected of killing Gitanjali due to illicit relations of her son-in-law
 vaise ye pehla mauka nahin he, jab is blind murder kii koi theory saamne ai he balki hakeekat to ye he ki pichley paanch dinon main police gitanjali ke kaatil kaa beshak koi suraag naa dhundh pai ho, uski maut ko lekar paanch alag-alag theoriyaan saamne aa chuki hai
 You will remember that the first time Gitanjali's corpse was found, her husband Ravneet Garg raised suspicion of his wife's suicide, but as soon as the family members of Gitanjali got the news of their daughter's death, the family accused the first charge against Ravneet
 How did Ravneet reach the result of Kudkushi without any investigation? In fact, Ravneed and his family killed Geetanjali for not giving birth to a son and now they are trying to escape the matter by calling themselves suicides, they also mentioned this in their first tahir given to the police
 lekin iske baad gharavaalon ne khulaasa kiya unhone shaadi ke vakt se lekar ab tak gitanjali ke sasuralwaalon ko naa sirf lakhon rupye kii gaadiyaan or nakadi dahej main di, balki samay-samay par sasuralwaalon kii taraf se aisi chizon kii maang bhi kii jaati rahi thi
 But just as the police started interrogating Gitanjali's husband Ravneet Garg amid these allegations, his statements took another new twist in the case
 garg ne kaha ki gitanjali unke ek naukar or driver se akasar khafa rahati thi or ho saktaa he ki un donon ne bhi gitanjali se khundak nikaalane ke liye sajeesh rachi ho ab aise main police ke liye naukar or driver se poochtacha karnaa jaruri ho gayalekin jaise is maamle kii aakhri theory nahin thi iske baad gitanjali ke gharavaalon ne apni beti ke katl ke liye jo vajah bataai, wo ab tak kii tamaam vajahon se sabase zyada ajeeb or chaunkaanewaali he
 If Gitanjali's brother believes it is very possible that her husband took Gitanjali's life only because of her illicit relationship
 ab is iljaam ke baad gitanjali ke gharavaalon se iske peeche kii vajah kaa poochna lajimi tha so, jaise hi unase ye sawaal poocha gaya, unhone jawaab diya 'haa, meri bahan ne bataaya tha avaidh sambandhon ke bare main, tabhi to hamane ye compline di he
 'now obviously, in this case the police is not able to get to the bottom of a theory, till then a new theory comes out and how long will the curtain be removed from the face of such a real murderer, at present no one has the answer
 udhar gudgaanv police katl ke paanch din baad bhi jhaadiyon main sar khapa rahi he or kamaal dekhie ki jis jhaadi kon wo pichley chaar dinon se jhaad rahi thi, yahaan tak ki jaanch ke naam par jhaadiyon ko ukhaad tak ke le gai usee jhaadi se vaardaat ke paanchaven din use do goliyaan milti hai
 These bullets were found from the same place from where the body of Gitanjali was found, in connection with the murder of Gitanjali, wife of CJM Ravneet Garg, the Special Investigation Team of the Gurgaon Police, ie SIT, was constantly scouring the police line park for the last five days
 kyonki police ko lag rahaa tha ki agar kaatil ne isi jagah par gitanjali kii jaan lee he, to yakeenan maukey se us par chalaai gai goliyaan bhi jarur milengi kyonki gitanjali ko jo teen goliyaan lagi thi, wo sabhi kii sabhi uske jism ko chhedati hui aar-paar nikal gai thior aakhirkaar somvaar ko police kii koshish tab rang laai, jab park main mitti chaanane ke dauraan use ek-ek kar do goliyaan mil gayi ye goliyaan kaartoos kaa wo hissaa hai, jo aam taur par nishane par lagati hai aise main police ko shaq he ki ye goliyaan gitanjali ko maari gai unheen teen goliyon main se hai, jo uske sharir ke aar-paar nikali thi
 Now the police are conducting forensic examination of these bullets, so that it can be clear whether these bullets were fired from the same revolver of CJM Garg, which was found on the occasion
 police ke liye ye jaananaa isliye bhi jaruri he, kyonki gitanjali kii laash jis tarah ek park ke bich khuli jagah par padi hui mili, use dekh kar is baat se bhi inkaar nahin kiya ja rahaa tha ki kaatil ne gitanjali kii jaan kahin or lene ke baad laash ko park main laakar phenk diya hoga
 Now if the forensic investigation makes it clear that these bullets are only from the six bullets fired by Ravneet Garg's revolver, then at least one thing will be clear that Gitanjali was murdered at the same place in the park, Where his dead body was found iske baad police nae sire se aas-paas ke ilaakon main is vaardaat ke chashmadid kii talash kar sakati he, saath hi us ilaake main vaardaat ke vakt kisi khaas mobile number kii movement kaa bhi pataa laga sakati he, taaki kaatil kaa koi suraag uske haath lag sakehaalanki ab tak kii tafteesh main ye baat saaf hui he ki vaardaat ke vakt gitanjali apane saath mobile phone lekar tahalne ke liye nahin gai thi lekin kya ghar se baahar jane se pehle gitanjali ne kisi ke saath phone par baat kii thi? kaatil tak pahunchane ke liye police ke liye is sawaal kaa jawaab jaananaa bhi zaruri he or isi vajah se police gitanjali kaa sidiaar yani mobile phone kii kol detail bhi khangaal rahi he
 In such a situation, if the movement of a particular mobile number recorded in Gitanjali's CDR is found around the park during the incident, then it can prove to be an important information for the police

 agar koi musiibat main he to uski madad nahin karte hai
 But when it comes to the Protest, they stand with a stick
 ham media vaale bhi koi doodh ke dhule nahin hai
 Nowadays people are also raising questions about the media
 media ke andar bhi karpshan he
 Journalists have also started talking as spokespersons of some party
 main yah nahin kahata ki hamaare samaaj ke sabhi log kharaab hai
 Many citizens also do good work
 kai netaa bhi samaaj ke hit main kaam kar rahe hai
 Many journalists also preserve this livelihood while keeping the value of journalism
 lekin sawaal yah uthta he yah dikhaawat kyon ? ham apane soch ko badal nahin paae lekin ravan ke putale ko jalaate rahete hai, yah sochakar ki buraai ke upar achchhai kii jeet hogi
 If this was done by burning effigy of Ravana, then the citizen of the country would not be so insecure
 desh tarki kar rahaa hota
 Ravana also had many good qualities
 ravan ek acha shaasha tha jo apni praja kaa khyaal rakhata tha
 But this is not visible in our society
 kai rajaneta ram banakar ravan kaa putala jalaayenge, ravan ke naam par raajnneeti kii roti seconge
 If our politicians were really Ram, today Ramrajya would have been in our country
 ham karpshan ke daldal main nahin hote, jati or dharm ke naam par vot nahin maangate, hindu or musalmaan ko do taraazuon main nahin taulate
 The comments ham khud ko sabase bade loktantric desh kaa naagarik maanate hai, kya sach main ham sabhi sabhy or sajag naagarik kaa dharm nibhaate hai
 When elections are held, we select a candidate who is not fit to be a leader, who ignores development
 ham yah dekhte hai hamaare dharm or jati se koun khadaa hua he, use chunakar aage bhejte hai
 Then when he does not work, he keeps crying
 hamaare pados main agar kisi kii hatya ho jaati he to ham dekhte rahete hai
 If someone is in trouble, they do not help
 lekin jab protest kii baat hoti he to danda lekar khadey ho jate hai
 We, the media, are also not a milkman
 aajkal media ko lekar bhi log sawaal uthaa rahe hai
 There is corruption inside the media
 patrkaar bhi kisi na kisi party ke pravaktaa ke rup main baat karne lage hai
 i do not say that all the people in our society are bad
 kai naagarik acha kaam bhi karte hai
 Many leaders are also working in the interest of society
 kai patrkaar bhi patrakarita kaa maan rakhte hue is jeevika ko bachaae rakhen hai
 But the question arises why this appearance? We could not change our thinking but keep burning effigy of Ravana, thinking that good will triumph over evil
 agar ravan kaa putala jalaane se yah ho jaataa to aaj desh kaa naagarik itnaa asurakshit na hota
 The country would have been progressing ham khud ko sabase bade loktantric desh kaa naagarik maanate hai, kya sach main ham sabhi sabhy or sajag naagarik kaa dharm nibhaate hai

 The English newspaper 'the Indian Express' has given such news

 rajpakshe se bhi hindi main hi baat kii modi nehaalanki vah angreji main itane sahaj hai ki unhen angreji kaa hindi main tarjuma karne ke liye dubhashie kii jarurat nahin he

 But for those who were speaking Hindi or Hindi mixed Urdu, the Prime Minister did not need an interpreter

 However, it is not clear whether External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj will adopt Vajpayee's method or not
 abhi tak unki sari baithken angreji main hui hai
 Foreign Minister of China is coming to India on Sunday

 Huawei's subsidiary Honor has recently launched Honor 10 Lite in the Indian market
 haalanki ise pichley saal hi china main launch kiya gaya tha
 Two variants of this smartphone have been launched in India
 4GB ram or 64GB internal storage verient kii keemat 13,999 rupee he
 The second variant has 6GB RAM 64GB internal memory
 isaki keemat 17,999 rupee he
 That is, 4,000 rupees more than 4GB variants
 bharat main mid range smartphone kharidne waalon ke liye 4,000 rupee kaa antar kaaphi bada he
 You have several options for Rs 17,999, which have more memory and specifications are also better
 4GB ram verient kii keemat thik he or is keemat par iske spacification bhi behatar hai
 Customers can purchase POCO F1 at this price
 POCO F1 main qolkom snapadragon 845 procesar he, jabaki Honor 10 Lite main aapako Kirin 710 miltaa he
 According to Geekbench tests, Qualcomm Snapdragon 710 gives better overall performance than Huawei's Kirin 710 chipset
 jaahir he qolkom snapadragon 845 in donon se fast he or ye abhi nayaa he
 Although Snapdragon 855 has also come in the market, but it is being given in high end smartphones and such phones are few
 bydaree kii baat karen to miderange yugers keliye yah bada mudda he
 In the 6GB variant of Honor 10 Lite, you will also get a 3,400mah battery, while Xiaomi's POCO F1 has a 4,000mah battery
 Honor 10 Lite main fast charging bhi nahin he, jabaki POCO F1 quick charge 3
 0 support means fast charge
 USB Type c aapako Honor 10 Lite main nahin miltaa, jabaki POCO F1 main USB Type c saport he
 You will be well aware of the advantages of USB Type C
 is daur main is bajet ke smartphone main USB Type c kaa naa diya janaa khalataa he
 If you want to buy a smartphone for gaming, for photography or for watching movies, performance is essential
 Snapdragon 845 kaa hona plus point he
 So if you are thinking of taking Honor 10 Lite, then you can buy POCO F1 instead
 agar Honor 10 Lite ke 6GB ram verient kii keemat 15,999 rupee bhi hoti to ye deal behatar hoti, lekin company ne ise base model kii tulana main 4,000 rupee mahangaa rakhaa he
 There is also a fact that nowadays companies reduce their smartphone prices ahead of time
 to dekhnaa dilachasp hoga or bhi smartphone jo 20 hajaar tak ke segment ke hai, inaki keemat kam hoti he yaa nahin
 If this happens then the competition in the market of 6GB RAM variants of Honor 10 Lite will be even stronger

 congress par nishaanaa sadhate hue unhone kaha, ''agar main swatchta abhiyaan kii baat se laal kila kii karata hum, to ye log majaak udaate hai
 During this time, Modi questioned the people present in the rally that if i talk about cleanliness, is it not right? unhone kaha ki congress kaa sirf ek kaam virodh karnaa he
 Be it a matter of economic reforms or a policy related issue

 What Modi said in Shivamoga: In Modi Shivamoga, PM Modi said, "I have a special relationship with Shivamoga
 main raajnneeti main kaaphi der se aayaa
 When i took a trip to Kashmir Tricolor from Kanyakumari in the year 1991, i had the first opportunity to address Shivamogga
 yah pehla avasar tha, jab maine itani badi jansabha ko sambodhit kiya tha
 i can never forget the love that Shivamoga gave me that day
 us samay karnataka praant ne is yatra ko safal banane ke liye kesaria vaahni banaai thi
 a large number of people of Karnataka reached Jammu and Kashmir and made this unity campaign a success
 ''congress par karaara hamalaa bolte hue modi ne kaha ki congress angrejon ke nakshekadam par chal rahi he
 The Congress wants to rule by dividing by caste, religion, sect and region
 unhone kaha ki congress apana hisaab tak nahin dena chaahati he
 Congress is lying
 unhone logon se kaha ki agar congress vot maangane aae, to poochna kii sand mafiaon ko sangrakshan dene vaale koun hai
 There is no difference between Congress's c and Corruption's c now

 What Modi said at Gadagadag rally in Gadag: After the Karnataka Assembly results, BJP will turn into PPP

 That is Punjab, Puducherry and Family Congress
 piem narendra modi ne shanivaar ko duusari raily gadag main kii
 In Gadag, Modi said that the people of Karnataka will also do the work of making the Congress Party a PPP Congress Party after the elections
 yani chunaav ke baad congress punjab, pudducheri or parivaar tak simat jaaegi
 In Gadag, PM Modi said that such a government is sitting in Karnataka, which keeps sleeping
 hamane sapana sanjoya he ki 2022 tak kisaanon kii aay doguni ho or sabake paas ghar ho
 At the rally, Modi said that there is only one mantra for the leaders of the Karnataka Congress, 'bap bada na bhaiya bade bade bhaupai rupaiya' and the Chief Minister has changed the saying 'father too big, brother too big but bigger than that' Rupaiya, Siddha Rupaiya '
 congress par nishaanaa sadhate hue modi ne kaha ki congress ne puure karnataka main vasuuli mafiaon kaa bahut bada network khadaa kiya hua he
 If this Congress government went, how would the money go to Delhi
 congress ke netaaon or mantriyon ne ek tanks bana rakhaa he, jisamen se bhrashtachar kaa paisa sidhe pipeline se dilli main baithe congress ke bade netaaon ke paas jaataa he
 This is the reason why the Congress is looking upset due to the defeat in Karnataka
 modi ne kaha ki karnataka main congress ne apana sabakuch daanv par lagaaya he, chunaav jeetne ke liye aaj congress chatapata rahi he
 The Congress government of Karnataka has found such herbs in the forests here, which they feel can keep the Congress alive in the entire country
 bhrashtachar congress ke jivit rahane ke liye jaruri he
 # 4
 tumkur menmodi ne kya kaha?shanivaar ko piem narendra modi ne sabase pehle tumkur main raily ko sambodhit kiya
 Modi said in the rally, Congress does poor, poor, poor in every election
 congress sirf yahi maala japakar hameshaa se chunaav jeetne kii koshish karti rahi he
 Congress leaders, who do not know green chilli and red chillies, talk about sleeping with potatoes, they are also talking about the farmer today
 isse pehle bhaashan kii shuruyaat karte hue modi ne kaha ki pradhanmantri banane ke turant baad mujhe is dharti ke vandan kaa saubhaahgya mila tha
 At the same time, Modi attacked the Congress fiercely
 piem ne kaha ki ham congress ke paapon ko dho rahe hai
 The Congress ran such a government that today this sector is craving for electricity
 is kshetra ke vikaas ke liye bhi hamaari sarkaar ne bada abhiyaan chalaaya he
 For so many years the Congress was under rule, why did it not do anything and the farmers of this country were drowned in debt
 unhen aatmahatya kerani pad rahi he
 Had the Congress done anything for the farmer, my farmer would have produced gold from the soil
 piem modi ne jedies par bhi nishaanaa saadhaa
 Modi said that in all surveys, JDS is not coming even at number three in the state
 aise main party ko apana vot dekar kharaab na kare, sirf bijepi hi congress ko haraa sakati he
 JDS cannot beat Congress, if any government in Karnataka can change then it is BJP
 modi ne kaha ki congress or jedies ke bich parde ke peeche santh-ganth he, congress kaa netaa jedies se dosti kar meyar ban chukaa he
 Modi said that he also respects former PM HD Deve Gowda
 modi aage bole ki 30-35 maheenon main hamaari sarkaar ne 1 lakh karod se zyada kharch kar kisaanon tak pani pahunchaaya he
 i have waged a fight against corruption
 hamane aadhaar ke saath diarect benefit transfar yojana shuru kii, hamane sidhe hakdaar logon ke bank khate main paise jamaa karana shuru kiya
 Modi said that i want to ask the Congress, which does politics in the name of farmers, why our Tumkuru farmers did not get the water from Hemvati river
 ham hemavathi or netravati nadi ko jodakar tumkur or aasapaas ke 8 jilon ke kisaanon tak pani pahunchaayenge
 At the same time, PM Narendra Modi tweeted this morning and also informed about his rallies
 piem ne kaha ki ve aaj ek baar phirkarnatakake logon ko sambodhit karne ja rahe hai
 Modi said that he will do 4 rallies today
 piem narendra modi karnataka main 15 reliyaan karne vaale the, lekin sambhaavna ke anusaar ve 21 reliyaan kar sakate hai
 Today once again i have the opportunity of connecting with my sisters and brothers of Karnataka

 Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP from Gorakhpur Yogi Adityanath lashed out at the Samajwadi Party (SP) government in Uttar Pradesh on Wednesday, despite a ban from the Lucknow administration
 yogi ne kaha ki soobe main loktantr khatre main he or use bachaane ke liye aage aana hoga
 Yogi said, "democracy in UP is in danger
 prashasan ne subah se hi pareshaan karke rakhaa hua he
 The government is after us
 pehle thakurdwara main kaarykram karne se roka gaya phir mainpuri main
 We were also prevented from meeting in Lakhimpur Kheri
 lakhanu main bhi hamaari raily par pratibandh laga diya gaya he
 " unhone kaha ki upra main loktantr ko kuchalane kaa prayaas lagaataar kiya ja rahaa he
 In order to impose democracy in UP, the government of a family of the state has to be overthrown
 upachunaav kaa matdaan hi is sarkaar kaa bhavishya tay karegaa
 Yogi said, "so the by-election will not have a significant impact on the state government as well as the Center, but if BJP wins, the countdown of familyism will start in UP
 " It is noteworthy that Yogi's meeting took place near Mashipulia in Lucknow, but the administration refused to approve the rally citing law and order
 is bich pradesh adhyaksh lakshmikant vaajapeyi ne kaha ki prashasan ne jis tareeke se yogi kii reliyon ko rokane kaa prayaas kiya, uski shikaayat chunaav ayog se jarur kii jaaegi

 sarkari sutron ko kahana he ki raily ke dauraan bhaajapa kaaryakartaaon or samaajawaadee party ke kaaryakartaaon main bhidnt kii sambhaavna thi
 It is being said that close to the venue of the rally of Yogi Adityanath, the administration also allowed Samajwadi Party leaders to rally around the same time

 pehle shivasena kaa jor shahari vikaas mantralay kii ore thise baar pavaar kii ensipi shivasena ke liye degi qurbaanimaharashtra ke itihaas main aisa pehali baar hone ja rahaa he jab shivasena ko rajya kaa grih mantralay milane ja rahaa he
 From 1999 to 2014, the Home Ministry of Maharashtra has been with the Nationalist Congress Party continuously
 lekin is baar gathbandhan dharm ke dabaav main jhukate hue ensipi ye ahm mantralay shivasena ko dene par raji ho gai he
 According to sharad-uddhav's long meeting on 'home', on Friday, Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray had a long talk with NCP President Sharad Pawar
 ye mulaakaat varli main hui
 During this time the portfolio sharing was discussed in detail
 meeting main mukhyamantri uddhav thakare ne shahari vikaas mantralay ke badale apni party ke liye grih mantralay kii joardaar pairvi kii
 Sources reveal that Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has understood the importance of the Home Ministry after being in the cm's post, now he wants this ministry for his party at all costs
 is meeting main shivasena ke ranneetikaar sanjay raut, shivasena ke vidhayak dal ke netaa ekanath scindia, varisht party netaa subhash desai, ensipi netaa jayant patil or ensipi netaa ajit pavaar shaamil the
 Pawar has had the power of the Home Ministry since 1999
 Let the NCP in Maharashtra keep the Ministry of Home Affairs in its quota for a long time
 1999 se lekar 2014 ke bich paanch baar maharashtra ke mukhyamantri badal gaye, lekin grih mantralay kaa jimmaa ensipi ke paas hi rahaa
 Sharad Pawar this time, these powerful ministries are ready to sacrifice for Shiv Sena
 sutara bataate hai ki pehle shivasena kaa jor shahari vikaas mantralay kii ore tha
 The party had been demanding this ministry since the formation of the government, but now the Shiv Sena has changed its mind
 bataa den ki 1995 main jab shivasena ne maharashtra main pehali baar sarkaar banaai thi, us dauraan bhi grih mantralay kaa pad bijepi ke paas tha
 When the Shiv Sena formed a government with the BJP in 2014, the BJP retained its claim on this ministry
 purv siem devendra fadanvis ne sunishchit kiya ki ye mantralay unke haath se baahar na jaae
 If Shiv Sena gets the Home Ministry this time, this will be the first time that Balasaheb's party will take over the Home Ministry of Maharashtra
 mantri ban gaye, mantralay nahin milabta den ki maharashtra main sarkaar gathan ko ek saptaah ho chukaa he, lekin jin netaaon ne siem uddhav thakare ke saath shapath lee thi, unhen abtak mantralay nahin mila he
 The BJP has attacked the government on this matter
 uddhav thakare ne 28 november ko siem pad kii shapath lee thi
 Along with him, 6 leaders of Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena were sworn in as Cabinet Ministers, but they have not been able to get the post of ministers yet
 bijepi netaa ashish shellar ne kaha ki is gathbandhan ke vidhayakon main gaharaa asantosh he
 According to the report, in this meeting, Sharad Pawar said that the department should be divided among the ministers at the earliest
 maharashtra main mantrimandal kaa vistaar nagpur main hone vaale sheetakaaleen satr ke baad prastaavit he

 ifa aword 2018 seremani main shridevi ko shradhanjali dene ke liye unke kuch yaadgaar video kaa istemaal kiya gaya tha
 Later a fan of Sridevi alleged that these videos belonged to her and the organizers used them without her permission
 ab boni kapur ne in aaropon kaa vistaar se jawaab diya he
 Sridevi's fan Saba Arif wrote a post on Facebook on July 30, stating that when she watched the IIFA Award ceremonies on TV the previous night, she showed her videos while paying tribute to Sridevi
 inaki parmishan nahin lee gai thi
 Saba says that she published the video of Sridevi on her channel Kaleidoscopia on 25 March 2018
 sabaa ne khud kaa shridevi par banaaya hua video kaa link bhi share kiya he
 Comparing the two videos, only the background music of Saba's video has been changed
 sabaa is baat se dukhi he ki unka video istemaal kiya gaya, wo bhi bina unase puche or credit die
 jahnavi-ishaan does not have work after beats? Know what is true In response to the allegations, Boney Kapoor has said, "almost all the clips in the video are from me or Yash Raj Films, which gives us the right to use them as we want
 video ko yashraj ke saath discshan ke baad ifa ke liye maine manjuuri di thi
 i want to know how Saba Arif is telling them her own
 yadi unhen video se koi dikkat he to aarope lagane ke bajaay unhen mujhase milanaa chahie
 Saba also reacted to Bonnie's cleanliness
 unhone kaha, "beshak video aapke apane hai, lekin maine is video main apane dilo-jaan lagaae hai, ise is tarah banane main teen din lage
 He did not change the clips or the sequence of songs
 ye sab maine mere clip istemaal hone ke liye nahin kaha tha, balki meri mehnat or bina meri jaankaree ke istemaal ke bare main tha
 These are still my videos and i am surprised to see such a reaction on my post
 "kya chori kaa tha IIFA main shridevi kaa tribut video? fain ne lagaae aaropabata den ki sabaa ke aaropon ke baad log ifa ke aayojakon ko internet par nishaanaa bana rahe hai
 Even several celebs are reacting to Saba Arif's allegations

 '' In the general election, where Narendra Modi has changed the electoral landscape of the country into a battle of BJP vs others, the by-elections in Bihar will be the first test that this Prime Minister's aura that has grown bigger than the BJP is still the party
 Can win or not
 loksabhaa chunaav main ‘modi lahar’ ne uttar pradesh or bihar kii hindi pattee main bijepi virodhiyon ko jameen dikhaa di thi—donon rajyon kii kul 120 main se virodhiyon ko mahaj 16 siten hasil huin
 By the way, by-elections are to be held in 12 assembly seats in Uttar Pradesh too, but notification has been issued for early elections to 10 seats in Bihar
 bihar main vidhayakon ke paala badalane se loksabhaa chunaav se pehle hi kai siten khaali ho gai thim
 The by-elections in Uttar Pradesh are likely to be held later this year along with the Maharashtra and Haryana assembly elections
 chunaav ayog ne bihar ke 10 sansadeey kshetron main faile 10 vidhansabha siton par up-chunaav ke liye 21 agast kii tithi nirdhaarit kii he
 The state executive committee of Bihar BJP met in Patna on 19-20 July, in which it was asked to re-unite in view of not only the immediate challenges but also the assembly elections due next year
 haalanki, iske baad koi ghoshnaa nahin kii gai, lekin bataaya jaataa he ki is baithak main kendriya mantri radha mohan singh ne ek tarah se susheel modi ko mukhyamantri kaa ummidavaar ghoshit kar diya, jabaki abhi is par kendriya netritv kii muhar lagani baaki he
 As the BJP prepares to meet the first challenge after May 16, Bihar by-elections are equally important for 'others' —rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and Janata Dal United (JDU)
 rajya main haaavee jatigat raajnneeti ke baavjood aam chunaavon main bijepi ko chaunkaane vaali safalataa mili thi
 Out of the total 40 seats in the state, BJP got 22 seats and its coalition partners Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) and Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP) got 9 seats
 is tarah gathbandhan ko kul 31 siten hasil huin
 On the other hand, ruling Nitish's JD (U) and Lalu Prasad's RJD won only two and four seats respectively
 ab rajya main or kisi tarah ke rajnatik badlaav ko rokane kii koshish main pehle ke do dhur virdohi rahe nitish kumaar or lalu prasad yadav haath milaane kii taiyaari kar rahe hai
 It was unthinkable before May 16 for Nitish to join hands with his long-time rival, who had made it to the top by opposing Lalu's alleged 'jungle raj' during rjd's tenure in the state
 unka yah nayaa gathbandhan apni pahchaan kii raajnneeti kii takat ko ekajute karne kaa hataasha bharaa kadam he, kaaphi kuch vaisaa hi jaise uttar pradesh ke 1993 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main ‘kamandal raajaneet’ ke charam daur main bijepi ko satta se baahar rakhane ke iraade se do dhur virodhiyon mulaayam singh yadav or mayawati ne haath mila liye the
 The BJP-JD (U) alliance won seven seats in 2010 out of the 10 assembly seats in Bihar where the by-elections are going to be held
 lekin loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan in siton par pade voton par najar daalen to nayaa endie (bijepi-algepi-araspi) in 10 main se 8 vidhansabha siton par badhat banaae hue tha
 Out of 10 Lok Sabha seats related to these, the bjp-led coalition won 8 seats
 agar jedy (you) gathbandhan or argedy gathbandhan ke ummidavaaron ko loksabhaa chunaav main mili saz voton kii baat kii jaae to aisa lagata he ki 10 vidhansabha siton main se chaar par unhen jeet mil sakati he
 Whether or not the pre-election announcement of the alliance helps to increase this number will be known only after the by-election
 argedy or jedy (you) ke netaa chunaav purv gathbandhan ke icchhuk dikh rahe hai
 Raghuvansh Prasad Singh, RJD vice-president and former Union minister who lost to ljp's Ram Kishore Singh in Vaishali seat in the Lok Sabha elections, says, "if the JD (U) goes ahead to form an alliance, we will consider it
" ham chaahate hai ki desh kii dharmanirpeksh takatein dharmanirpeksh maton ko phir se ekajute karen
 "believing that Mandal's politics is now in its final stages, they insist that the goal of this alliance should be 'development'
 singh kehete hai, “bihar ke vikaas ke liye gathambadhan ke saajhedaaron ko nunatam saajha kaarykram taiyaar karnaa chahie
 Lalu's confidant said that the RJD chief was so attracted to the idea of coalition because people close to him were just discussing that the RJD and JD (U) together got more than 45 per cent of the votes in the Lok Sabha elections
 Have met
 duusari ore nae endie ko sirf 39 fisadi (bijepi ke 29
 4 per cent, 6 of LJP
 4 fisadi or araspi ke 3 fisadi) vot
 BJP has no fear of this math
 bijepi netaa shahanvaj hossain kehete hai, “nitish-lalu kaa gathbandhan rajya main bijepi kii takat par muhar lagayegaa
 Nitish thinks that the people who have voted for him will vote for him even if he stands with Lalu
 aisa hoga nahin
 The RJD-JD (U) alliance will not have 'nitish Raj', it will run at the behest of Lalu
 sirf bijepi hi lalu ke pratyaksh yaa paroksh asar ko roak sakati he
 "RJD and JD (U) leaders say that talks about the alliance are moving in a 'positive' direction, but there are many issues that need to be resolved
" sabase bada sawaal yah he ki gathbandhan kaa netaa koun hoga-nitish yaa lalu? siton ke bantwaare kaa formula tay karnaa bhi samasya ho sakati he
 Lalu cannot contest elections because he is convicted in the fodder scam
 unki patni or bihar kii purv mukhyamantri rabari devi kaa maananaa he ki kisi bhi bijepi virdohi gathbandhan main lalu kaa hi prabhutv rahegaa
 JD (U) has already named Nitish as the chief ministerial candidate for the 2015 assembly elections
 aam chunaav main jedy (you) ke dayaneey pradarshan—iske 26 ummidavaaron kii jamaanat jabt ho gai—ko dekhte hue nishchit rup se lalu baari mol-tol karenge
 JD (U) leaders say that the RJD was almost wiped out in the 2010 assembly elections
 use vipaksh ke netaa pad ke liye jaruri 10 fisadi siton par bhi jeet hasil nahin hui thi
 This battle of leadership between the two satraps will decide whether after a year of Bihar's war, they will unite against the emerging BJP and win or win separately
 madhya pradesh ke indore se bhi aisi hi ek mahila kii bahaduree kii khabar aa rahi he

 Former Central Reserve Bank (RBI) Governor Raghuram Rajan has said that the Reserve Bank Governor is not a bureaucrat for the Central Government and it is a mistake of the Government to consider him a bureaucrat
 yah baat raghuram rajan ne apni nai kitaab 'ai du wat ai du' (I Do What i Do) ke jariye rakhte hue kaha he ki kendra sarkaar ko rigerv bank governor ke pad ko lekar apane rukh main sudhaar karne kii jarurat he
 According to Rajan, the biggest danger of not having a clear definition of the Reserve Bank Governor's rights is that bureaucracy is constantly trying to reduce its powers
 haalanki rajan ne kaha ki governnar kii shaktiyon ko lekar maujuuda sarkaar se pehle kii sarkarein bhi aisa karti raheen he jisase arthvyavastha main kendriya bank kii bhoomika kamjor hui he
 Significantly, Raghuram Rajan's new book is just a compilation of his speeches and articles
 yah kitaab purv main kendriya bank ke governor rahe duvuru subbarao kii kitaab kii tarah apane kaarykaal kaa purna vrittant nahin he
 Nor does Rajan's book reveal the behind-the-scenes game in decisions taken during his tenure like former Governor Yag Venugopal Reddy
 reddy 2003 se 2008 tak kendriya bank ke governor rahe

 'rajan said,' In an environment where the central bank has to stand firmly against the top tier of the central and state governments from time to time, i am my predecessor, Dr
 subbarao ke shabdon ko yaad karata hum
 When he said that the Finance Minister would one day say that i am often upset with the Reserve Bank, so upset that i want to go out for a walk, even if i have to go alone
 lekin bhagwaan kaa dhanyavad he ki rigerv bank yahaan he
 Addressing a gathering at St
 Stephens College in the capital, Delhi, Rajan said, "the work of the Central Bank was not as easy as it seemed and certainly it was not at all to reduce and raise interest rates
" ’bainkon kii swatantraaa jarurirajan ne aage kaha ki kaamkaaj ke bare main faisle lene kii swatantraaa rigerv bank ke liye mahatvapurn he
 Rajan spoke of independence in the operations of the central bank for macroeconomic stability
 saath hi unhone yah bhi kaha ki ‘rigerv bank ko sarkaar dwaara tay ek dhaanche ke tahat sadaa hi vitt mantralay ke paraamarsh ke saath kaam karnaa he or vah sabhi baadhyataaon se mukt nahin ho saktaa

 unhone kaha ki vrihad aarthik sthayitv ke liye bharat ko majboot or swatantra rigerv bank kii aavashyaktaa he

 This is amazing of 'atul sir' class
 1874 main bani madhya pradesh kii pehali jail main in dinon tees se zyada kaidi angreji sikh rahe hai
 More interestingly, the English teacher of prisoners Atul Anand himself is also a prisoner and is serving a life sentence
 angreji kii class shuru hone kaa vakya kuch is tarah he
 Some time ago some courses of Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU) started here
 unamem emb kaa course angreji main tha
 Some of the prisoners here wanted to do MBA but they were obstructed by the lack of knowledge of English
 tab jail prashasan kii ore se jail main angreji kii koching kaa intjaam kiya gaya gaya
 For a few days, an outside teacher took an English class, but due to some reasons, this class soon stopped
 angreji seekhney kii kaidiyon kii lalak ko dekhakar anand ne unhen angreji sikhaane kaa bidaa uthaaya
 An electrical engineer by profession, 24-year-old Anand is serving life imprisonment for killing a policeman since December last year
 anand bataate hai ki sajaa hone ke baad vah himmat haar chuke the lekin jab se unhone kaidiyon ko padhaanaa shuru kiya he, tab se unke jivan main nai aashaa kaa sanchaar hone laga he
 They teach English to inmates every morning for two hours in the jail for the last three months
 kaidiyon or anand ke utsaah ko dekhte hue jail prashasan ne bhi is pahal ko protsaahit kiya
 Looking at Anand's teaching skills, in addition to the inmates preparing for MBA in class, there are those prisoners who have never had any relationship with English
 aise hi ek kaidi 52 saal ke ayodhya prasad angreji kii ek bhi class nahin chhodte
 Jailed for the last nine years, Prasad is serving life imprisonment
 ve kehete hai, ''aaj ke samay main angreji siikhnaa bahut jaruri he
 i very much wish that i would surprise my three daughters by talking with them in a fluent English
 ''prasad subah kii class main jo kuch bhi sikhte hai, raat main duusare kaidiyon ke saath milakar uskaa abhyaas bhi karte hai
 These prisoners try to speak in English with each other as far as possible
 jab koi dikkat aati he to turant apane shikshak se puch lete hai, jo unke aas-paas hi maujuud rahete hai
 These students of 'atul Sir's class' say that they are enjoying so much for the first time in learning English
 jail adheekshak gopal tamrakar bhi is pahal se khaase khush hai
 He says, "atul Anand's English class has further enhanced the atmosphere here
" bandi bhi khush hai or iske achche parinaam saamne aa rahe hai
 Tamarkar says that the real purpose of the jail is that by the time the prisoners are released from here, they should be completely away from the world of crime and be able to live a respectable life
 jail prashasan is baat se bhi khush he ki kaidiyon ko angreji seekhney ke liye baahar ke shikshak kaa muhtaaj nahin hona pad rahaa he
 This initiative has brought a new ray of hope in the lives of prisoners

 With the UP elections approaching, the changed strategy of the Congress and the increasing activism of Priyanka Gandhi in it has led to speculation whether Priyanka Gandhi will contest from the Rae Bareli Lok Sabha seat in 2019 elections instead of Sonia Gandhi
 haal ke dinon main sonia gandhi kii sakriyata siyaasi galiyare main kam hi dekhi gai he
 Experts say that Sonia Gandhi's activity has declined due to poor health
 haalanki, priyanka gandhi ke karyaalay ne in atakalon kaa khandan kiya he or kaha he ki abhi vidhansabha chunaav se jude kaam main ve vyast hai or 2019 ke bare main soch bhi nahin rahi hai
 In such a situation, the speculation about contesting elections is baseless
 sapa-congress gathbandhan main priyanka ke phone se bani batupi chunaav ke liye jab sapa se gathbandhan par baat bigadate-bigadate bani to iskaa shreypriyanka gandhiko diya gaya
 It was said that Akhilesh Yadav's wife Dimple talked about the alliance due to Priyanka Gandhi's Understanding
 isse pehle bhi priyanka gandhi apratyaksh taur par siyasat main sakriy rahi hai
 Priyanka has been watching the election management of Congress in Amethi and Rae Bareli Lok Sabha seats since 1999

 Many senior Congress leaders have acknowledged Priyanka's role in the alliance with Samajwadi Party (SP) in Uttar Pradesh
 congress 105 siton par, jabaki sapa 298 siton par chunaav ladegi
 a Congress leader said that Priyanka Gandhi played an important role in organizing the alliance
 'party main priyanka ke liye baari samarthan'congress ke pravaktaa ajay kumaar ne kaha, "congress kaaryakarta party main unki ahm bhoomika ke icchhuk hai
 There is huge support for them, which looks like
 jab unki bhoomika tay kii jaaegi, aapako soochna de di jaaegi
 "the Congress spokesperson said that party vice-president Rahul Gandhi requested Priyanka and the Congress general secretary and in-charge of the party in Uttar Pradesh played a role in an alliance with the SP
 ahamed patel ne kiya twitaparty ke senior netaa ahm patel ne bhi twit kar sapa-congress gathbandhan main priyanka ke role ko sweekaar kiya
 It is clear from these things that the party was moving ahead from the hesitation seen by the Congress in bringing Priyanka to the political table
 iske saath hi ye atakalein bhi lagane lagi he ki kya priyanka 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main raibareli seat se ummidavaar hongi?wrong to suggest lightweights were dealing on behalf of Congress party
 Discussion was at the highest level- b / w CM (UP), GS i / c & Priyanka Gandhi— Ahmed Patel (@ahmedpatel) January 22, 2017 Why from Rae Bareli? Sonia Gandhi first contested Amethi in 1999
 haalanki, rahul gandhi ke liye rasta taiyaar karne ke vaaste 2004 main wein raibareli seat se chunavi maidan main utrin
 Now both these seats are known as Gandhi family seats
 rahul gandhi 2004 se amethi se saansad hai to sonia raibareli kaa pratinidhitiv karti hai
 Priyanka Gandhi oversees election management in both these seats and Priyanka has had direct contact with the people there

 Born in the US from a Pakistani poet-diplomatic father and an American mother, Headley was fond of drugs and sex

 According to an intelligence official, "from there the plan to attack Mumbai sprouted
 hedli kii ore se mahatvapurn jaankariyaan milane par iesai or lashkar kaa bharosa bad gaya or ve zyada bade hamale ke liye taiyaar ho gaye
 "the attack on Mumbai is the only such attack in the world that has all the elements of modern terrorism — infiltration by sea, fidayeen commandos and explosive-laden vehicles
" sitambar, 2007 tak lashkar ne mumbai ke taj mahal hotel main mehmaanon par hamalaa karke bhaagane kii yojana hi banaai thi
 The plan saw two gunmen sneaking into Mumbai from the indo-nepal border or the indo-bangladesh border, attacking and then fleeing towards Kashmir

 These attackers had never been out of Pakistan before

 But the reality came out
 use jail main daal diya gaya lekin vah vahaan se faraar ho gaya

 vah kashmir main jang karne ke liye taiyaar tha, lekin 40 saal kii umr dekhte hue use manaa kar diya gaya

 There was also an argument between the two about Headley's first wife at the hotel, and in December 2007, Faiza fought outside Headley's house in Lahore and fought
 iske liye hedli ko aath din jail main bhi bitaane pade
 Faiza then took refuge in the US Embassy in Islamabad and told the Security Bureau of the US State Department that her husband is a drug trafficker and terrorist spy who is going to India for a covert operation
 usne bataaya tha ki jab usne america agenton se baat kii to unke paas pehle se hi hedli ke bare main ek file maujuud thi
 Importantly, no such intelligence was ever shared with Indian agencies

 New England Test captain Joe Root wants to take his batting to the level where Virat Kohli of India and Steve Smith of Australia have reached after becoming captain
 gauratlab he ki root ko elestare cook ke istife ke baad england kaa nayaa test captain banaaya gaya he
 Cook had resigned from England's Test captain after a 0–4 defeat in the Test series against India
 root abhi tak apane karier ke 53 test main 52
 Has scored 4594 runs at an average of 80
 kohli kaa captain banane ke baad ausat 67 se upar he or vah world ranking main top-3 main hai
 Joe Root said, 'I want to do the way Virat and Steve Smith have performed
 main unase prerit hokar usee str tak janaa chahta hum
 Every child wants to be the captain of England one day and i have got this opportunity, so i want to leave an impression of my performance
 ’ test cricket main viraat or steve smith kaa ballebaaji ausat abhi root se upar he
 The special thing is that even after assuming the captaincy, these two have not let their batting be affected in any way
 jo root bhi viraat or smith kii tarah pradarshan karnaa chaahate hai
 Smith has so far scored 60 in 50 tests
 15 ke ausat se 4752 ran banaae hai jisamen 17 shatak shaamil hai
 Similarly, Virat Kohli scored 51 in 54 tests
 75 ke ausat se 4451 ran banaae hai jisamen 16 shatak shaamil hai
 Virat is currently the only batsman in the world to have Test, ODI and T20 average of more than 50
 jo root ne kaha,‘viraat or steve smith ne jis tarah se pradarshan kiya he, main bhi vaise hi karnaa chahta hum
 i want to go to the same level, inspired by them
 har baccha ek din england kaa captain bananaa chahta he or mujhe yah mauka mila he lihaaja main apane pradarshan kii chhap chhodana chahta hum
 In Test cricket, Virat and Steve Smith's batting average is still above the route
 khaas baat yah he ki captaini sanbhaalane ke baad bhi in donon ne apni ballebaaji ko kisi bhi tarah prabhavit nahin hone diya he
 Joe Root also wants to perform like Virat and Smith
 smith ne ab tak 50 test main 60
 He has scored 4752 runs at an average of 15 which includes 17 centuries
 isi tarah viraat kohli ne 54 test main 51

 After 9 months of demonetisation, Yashwant Sinha, finance minister in bjp's Atal Vihari Bajpai government, is saying that the current Modi government has pushed a healthy economy from the previous governments towards recession
 sinha kaa kahana he ki party halkon main unke alaava aisa maanane vaale kai netaa hai lekin kaaran vash vah kuch bol nahin paa rahe
 Sinha says that he is criticizing the economic policies of the Modi government while playing its responsibility towards the country
 haalanki sinha aise pehle netaa, arthshaastri yaa purv mantri nahin he jo notebandi ke faisle par sawaal khadaa kar rahe hai
 During the last 9 months, the former Prime Minister has declared this wrong decision
 desh or duniya ke tamaam arthshaastri bhi daleel de rahe hai ki notebandi kaa yah faisla apana makasad kabhi puraa nahin kar saktaa
 The former RBI governor has claimed that this is a hasty decision of the Modi government which will have a negative impact on the economy for a long time
 inke alaava kai global aarthik agenciyaan bhi daawa kar chuki hai ki notebandi ne raftaar pakadati bhartiya arthvyavastha par brake laga diya he
 In such a situation, what happened to those benefits that many government and non-governmental organizations, including the Finance Ministry, showed to the common man
 vahiin vitt mantri arun jetali ne ek kadam aage badhkar notebandi ke in phaaydon kii puri list apni website par bhi laga di thi
 Were all these benefits counted only to cover the decisions of the Modi government? One by one, to see how the benefits of demonetisation are demolished: Read also: Demonetisation, Ministry of Finance, Reserve Bank and National Confusion 1
 bhrashtachar par lagaam?desh main 500 or 1000 rupee kii pratibandhit karency kul karency kii 85 fisadi thi
 This currency was also an apparel of corruption in the country
 notebandi ke faisle ke baad se hi bhrashtachar ke liye is karency kaa istemaal rukne kii baat kahi gai
 At the same time, the new currency was gradually operated by the government, which increased the problems of the common man, but it is clear from the new currency recovered in the raids of the investigating agencies during the last 9 months that the new currency has replaced the old currency
 Has not left 2
 Cashless Economy? On the decision of demonetisation, the Modi government said that to create a cashless economy, it is necessary that more and more transactions are done in the country through digital mediums
 isse karency par desh kii nirbharta kam hogi or rigerv bank or anya baikon ke saath-saath kendra sarkaar ko karency sanchaalan main kam kharch karnaa padegaa
 The cashless economy will benefit the government as well as the common man, as his money will be more secure in digital exchanges
 lekin beete 9 maheenon ke dauraan nai karency kii chapai or mudra sanchaar kii laagat ne rigerv bank ke munaafe ko saaf kar diya
 3
 nakli karency par lagaam?notabandi kaa faisla lete hue sarkaar ne bataaya tha ki desh main seemapar se nakli karency ke pravaah kii gambhir samasya thi
 The fake currency that reached his hands had to suffer immediate loss of such value
 vahiin sarkaar ko bhi iske rokthaam ke liye bade network kaa sahaara lenaa padataa tha
 Therefore, the government claimed that the use of currency (digital payment) and large denominations will clear the fake currency from the country in one stroke
 vahiin nai karency ke suraksha maanak zyada pukhta hone ke kaaran agle kai varshon tak arthvyavastha nakli karency se surakshit rahegi
 Water on such benefits has also been restored as new fake currency has been recovered from the country in large quantities during the last 9 months
 4
 Will the real estate sector be transparent? The government hoped that the biggest benefit of demonetisation would be in the real estate sector
 beete kai dashakon se real estate sector kaledhan ke nivesh kaa sabase bada jariya tha
 Due to this, it was common for the paper to have a big difference between the purchase of property and the actual purchase
 isse jahaan sarkaar ko stamp duty main bada nuksaan hota tha vahiin aam aadmi ko blikemani na hone ke chalate makaan kharidne main dikkaton kaa saamana karnaa padataa tha
 But the condition of real estate sector has worsened over the last 9 months
 ek darjan se zyada bade real estate projects atake paden hai vahiin kai badi companiyon ke upar diwalia hone kaa khatra mandara rahaa he
 5
 khatm hoga kalaadhan?notebandi ke baad desh main kaledhan ke khilaaf saamaajik badlaav laane ke kaam ko aasaani se kiya ja saktaa he
 It is a fact that black money cannot be eliminated from any economy until it is boycotted at the social level
 abhi tak kaledhan kaa nivesh property or sona-chaandi main kiya jaataa tha jisase inaki keemat vaastavik keemat se hameshaa adhik bani rahati thi
 After demonetisation, the use of black money in these areas will be curbed
 aisa kendra sarkaar ko ummid thi
 But the RBI data in August 2017 also dented this advantage as 99 percent of the banned currency reached the RBI through banks in the demonetization process
 6
 Parallel economy will be closed? There was always a parallel economy in the country with the help of black money and corruption
 desh main koyala kii khaadaan se lekar sadak kinare chaay or sabji bechney vaale is samanaantar arthvyavastha main shaamil rahete the
 Most people here used to carry out their economic activities, damaging the country's gross domestic income
 sarkaar kaa maananaa tha ki notebandi ke baad digital pement kii ore rujhaan or notebandi se khatm hue kaledhan kaledhan ke saath-saath is samanaantar iconomi ko mukhyadhara main jodne main aasaani hogi
 But the financial situation has worsened during the last 9 months
 manuphacchiring sector ke saath-saath sarvice sector main lagaataar giravat darj ho rahi he
 7
 badhegaa tex base?desh main digital pement ko badhaava dene kaa sabase bada phayda hoga ki bade se bade or chote se chote tranjaction bainkon ke paas darj honge
 The Income Tax Department will also be constantly monitoring these transactions
 jab desh main blike iconomi kaa aadhaar nahin rahegaa to jaahir he zyada se zyada log tex kaa bhugtan karne ke baad hi apni kharid-farokht ko puraa kar paaenge
 This will result in a rapid jump in the revenue of the Central Government, its financial deficit will be reduced and it will have enough resources to improve the country's infrastructure
 lekin notembdi ke baad ke aankadon se saaf ho gaya ki kendra sarkaar ko is faisle se rajasav main koi phayda nahin hua
 8
 financial seaving main hoga ijaphanotbandi ke pehle tak desh main log apni seaving ko property, sona or jewelery main nivesh karte the
 When needed, people sold it and converted it into currency
 maujuuda samay main desh ke 50 fisadi se adhik parivaar apni sevings ko inhen tareekon se rakhte hai
 Is black money most of the money invested here? The government hoped that after demonetisation, real estate and gold would not be able to give the expected returns, so people would turn to banks to keep their savings and investments in options like savings banks, demand drafts and mutual funds would increase
 lekin yah phayda bhi bainkon ko nahin mila
 Also read: 20169 will be remembered for surgical strike against black money
 badhengi bainkon kii kamai?sarkaar ne ginaya tha ki notebandi se kaledhan par lagaam ke saath-saath teji se badhate digital pement se bainkon kii kamai main bada ijapha dekhne ko milegaa
 This increase will be used by the bank to expand itself as well as to lure customers
 vahiin notebandi se bainkon ke paas ekatrit hui daulat se unhen apana purana ghaataa paatane main bhi madad milegi
 But during 9 months, there has been a slowdown in banks and their npas remain intact
 vahiin aam aadmi ke liye ab banking mahangi ho chuki he
 After demonetisation, banks across the country have charged many free services offered to customers
 10 sasta hoga karj?vittiya jaankaron ko hawaale se kaha gaya ki notebandi ke baad se bainko ko rahe phaayde kaa sidhaa asar desh main byaaj daron par padana tay he
 Along with transparency in the financial world, banks will try to give more and more loans to spread their business
 vahiin graahakon ko lubhaane ke liye vah karj par lagane vaale byaaj daron main badi katautee kaa elaan kar sakate hai
 With this, loans for business, buying cars or scooters or business in the country will start getting cheaper rates
 gauratlab he ki notebandi ke baad arabiai do baar repo repo rate main katautee kar chuki he lekin is katautee ko philhal puri tarah se grahakon tak pahunchane main bank naakamayab rahe hai
 At the moment, waiting for cheap loan is doing business with common man
 uttarakhand ke purv mukhyamantri harish ravat ko sibiai ne sting maamle kii jaanch ke silsile main pesh hone kaa saman jari kiya he
 The sting is reportedly shown in a deal with a journalist to regain the support of rebel mlas
 tippaniyan Rawat will be questioned on Monday
 ravivaar ko unhone video main maujuud hone kii baat sweekaar kii thi or kaha tha ki ek patrkaar se milanaa aparaadh nahin he
 However, till now they have been challenging the validity of this CD as fake
 harish ravat ne dehradun main ek kaarykram main bhaag lene ke baad samvaadadaataaon se ek baatcheet main kaha, 'kya kisi patrkaar se milanaa koi aparaadh he? tab tak takneekee rup se ayogy ghoshit nahin hue vidhayakon main se kisi ne bhi mujhase baatcheet kii to isse kya fark padataa he? raajnneeti main kya kisi channel ko ham band kar sakate hai?' Claiming his innocence in this regard, the former Chief Minister said that if anything from the CD is certified that he offered cash or any other kind in exchange for taking the support of the disgruntled mlas, he would be hanged in front of the public Are ready
 unhone kaha, 'agar mere khilaaf aisa koi pramaan miltaa he ki ki maine kisi ko dhan yaa kisi or cheez kii peshkash kii to mujhe ghantaghar par lataka dijie
 'significantly, Ghantaghar Chowk is located exactly in the middle of Dehradun

 pdf The future of the Orissa project of South Korean steel company Posco has once again fallen into limbo with the latest decision of Union Ministry of Forest and Environment, but the Government of Odisha is confident that the project worth Rs 52,000 crore will be raised
 paryaavaran mantralay ne is pariyojna ke liye van sambandhi manjuuri ko roak diya he
 Orissa Steel and Industry Minister Raghunath Mohanty believes that Posco's project will move forward
 unhone tamaam atakalon ko khaarij karte hue kaha, hamen bharosa he ki posco paradeep ke paas ikai laga paaegi
 Orissa Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik had also said earlier that he is still confident that this dream project will come into force
 par pariyojna ke raste main jis tarah ek ke baad ek aadchan aa rahi he, usase aise logon kii sankhya kaaphi kam rah gai he, jo patnayak ke is bharose par vishwaas kar paa rahe hai
 Posco signed a Memorandum of Understanding (mou) for the project with the state government on 22 June 2005
 company aaj tak is 1
 For the project of 20 million tonnes per annum capacity, 4,000 acres of land is waiting
 posco pratirodh sangram samiti ke adhyaksh abhaya sahu ne kaha, tamaam prayaason ke baavjood sarkaar posco ko ek inch jameen bhi uplabdh nahin kara pai he
 We will continue to fight for our rights
 emoyu ke praavdhaanon ke anusaar, company ko 60 lakh ton kshamta kii ikai ko july, 2010 yaa pir jameen kaa kabja lene ke 36 maah main chaalu karnaa tha
 People from two of the seven villages near the project site are strongly opposed to the project, due to which work has not been progressed
 haalanki, is pariyojna ko pradhanmantri ke saath saath rajya ke mukhyamantri kaa bhi samarthan hasil he
 All Odisha Steel Pounding President PL Kandoi said, "as the project is facing obstacles, only time will determine its future
" company ke ek kaaryakari ne gopneeyata kii shart par bataaya ki yadi posco ko jameen mil bhi jaati he, company ke liye nirmaan ko aage badhanaa us samay tak sambhav nahin hoga jab tak ki use kachche maal k aapurti sunishchit nahin hoti he
 The people of Cuttack are opposing the company's plan to divert water from the Naraj Dam of the Mahanadi River
 iske alaava posco dwaara sundargarh jile main khandadhar louh ayask bhandar se ayask ke khanan kaa bhi virodh kar rahe hai
 The Government of Odisha has recommended Khandadhar Bhandar for a possible license in the name of Posco India, but it has been challenged in the High Court
 abhi ucch nyaayalay ne is par nirnay nahin diya he
 In such a situation there is uncertainty about the availability of raw materials for the company
 'mujhe tiger shroff hairat main daal dete hai
 It seems that that human being can do anything 'in a recent interview, Ayushmann Khurrana had said this about Tiger
 iske alaava actor pulakit samraat bhi ek intervyuu main tiger shroff kii tarifon ke pul baandhte nazar aae the
 As well as supporting Bollywood stars, Tiger has carved an image of an action star from his last few films, apart from Karan Johar's film, doing a film with Hrithik Roshan as well
 tiger ke sitare bulandiyon par hai lekin ek or actor aisa he jise kai log desh kaa sabase behtareen ection star maanate he, ve girls ko self dephence techniks sikhaate hai, kai baar chot khaane ke baad bhi apane sabhi stants khud karte hai, jo duniya ke top 6 marshall artist main apana naam shumaar kara chuke hai or jinaki killer body ke saamne jon abraham tak fike nazar aae the lekin bollywood ne kahin naa kahin is sitare ko said line kiya hua he
 The name is Vidyut Jamwal

 Apparently due to this, electricals are bereft of the powerful Bollywood work that can make actors in Bollywood go from floor to floor, but electricity does not matter much to the people who live on their own terms and their talent and their hard work Let's focus on vidyut sabase pehle surkhiyon main tab aae the jab jon abraham ke saath unhone film force main kaam kiya tha
 Seeing the stunning body of shirtless electricity in the climax with John, many viewers realized that this star is going to become the new action star of Bollywood

 com / wv904dfjpi The Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) satellite on June 16 took pictures of the formation of thick clouds in the skies of Uttarakhand
 isro kii website par bheji gai in tasveeron ke vishleshan ke baad ‘baari barish yaa badal fatne’ kii bhavishyavaanee kii gai or uttarakhand main 11 sthanon par laal nishaan laga diya gaya
 Barkot, Kirtinagar, Muni ki Reti, Narendra Nagar, Pauri, Raiwala, Rishikesh, Rudraprayag, Srinagar, Tehri and Uttarkashi will be hit by heavy rains in a few hours
 yah ab tak spasht nahin he ki ye tasviren samay rahete bhartiya mausam vibhaag ko bheji gai thim yaa nahin
 ISRO has abruptly changed the site after India Today Group's English news channel Headlines Today reported it and wrote on it that everything was experimental
 isro ko tasviren milane ke baad 24 ghante se bhi kam samay main baari barish ne in sari jagahon par vinaash kaa tandav shuru kar diya
 More than 1,000 people were killed and more than 5,000 are still missing
 marane waalon kii sahi sankhya ke bare main abhi tak anumaan hi lagaae ja rahe hai
 It is the worst natural disaster in the country after the tsunami in December 2004
 shavon kii durgandh ab hawa main vyaapt he
 This destruction has put a question mark on India's readiness to deal with the natural crisis
 desh ke saamne maujuud khataron ke bare main grih mantralay kii 2009 kii report ekadam spasht he
 According to the report, 27 out of 35 states and union territories are prone to disaster
 desh kaa kareeb 58
 6 percent of the area is earthquake prone area
 4 karod hectare (12 pratishat bhubhag) kshetra main baadh or kataav kaa andeshaa rahata he, 7,516 kimi ke kul samudr tat main 5,700 kimi tat tufaan or sunami se prabhavit ho saktaa he, kul krishi kshetra ke 68 pratishat hisse main sookhe kaa andeshaa rahata he, pahari ilaakon main bhuskhalan or barfile tufaan kaa khatra hota he
 The crisis-prone British company, Maplecraft, last year named India as the fifth-largest natural disaster-prone country after Bangladesh, the Philippines, the Dominican Republic and Myanmar
 prakritik vipatti se nibatane main bharat kaagajon par to kaaphi taiyaar dikhaai detaa he
 It has a complete system of remote sensing devices, which is one of the largest such systems in the world
 isamen 11 upgrah hai, jo mausam main hone vaale kisi bhi badlaav kaa pataa laga sakate hai, pradhanmantri kii adhyakshata main rashtriya aapadaa prabandhan praadhikaran (endieme) he, jiskaa vaarshik bajet 800 karod ru
 Belongs to yah kendriya mashinari rajya sarkaron se judi hoti he, jo kisi bhi sankat ke samay sabase pehle sakriy hoti he
 But Uttarakhand has shown how slow the wheel of this heavy machine moves at the time of need
 rajya sarkaar dwaara sashastr balon ko 17 june ko bulaayaa gaya or vah bhi tab, jab kendriya jal sansaadhan mantri harish ravat ne raksha mantri e
 K
 antni se baat kii
 Had there been direct talks between the state government and the armed forces, the crisis could have been accurately described and the army would have been activated quickly
 lekin yah to dheron galatiyon main se sirf ek udhaaharan he
 In early June, two doppler radars were approved by Uttarakhand for security by Jaan's security
 ye radar badalon ke sateek aakaar kaa pataa laga lete hai or aath ghante pehle tak kii turant chetavanee de dete hai
 But they could not be established, as the state government could not provide land for them in Nainital and Mussoorie
 aktubar, 2009 main jab andhra pradesh kii krishna nadi main is sadi kii sabase bhayanak baadh ai thi, to rajya sarkaar usase nibatane ke liye taiyaar thi
 Flood sensing devices warned him of increasing water in the river and computers showed graphs which areas would be affected by the flood
 natijatan, baadh aane se pehle hi 1,00,000 logon ko samay rahete surakshit jagahon par pahunchaa diya gaya tha
 Only 37 people died in that natural disaster
 vinaash kii jagah par jaldi pahunchohimalay ke samvedansheel ilaake main sthit uttarakhand ne kabhi bhi apana rajya aapadaa prabandhan bal (esadiaref) banane kii jarurat nahin samajhi
 Only Bihar, Odisha, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra and Nagaland have set up SDRF battalions with 1,000 trained personnel to rescue people in times of disaster
 rashtriya aapadaa prabandhan praadhikaran (endieme) kii ore se is tarah kaa bal banane kaa nirdesh diya gaya he
 It took the Uttarakhand administration nearly two days to realize that dealing with heavy rains between 14-17 June was beyond the capacity of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF)
 tab tak yani 19 june tak bahut se log maare ja chuke the
 The biggest reason for this was that mobile towers fell in many places due to heavy rains, floods and landslides
 isaki vajah se rudraprayag, chamoli, uttarkashi or pithauragarh ke kai hisson se phone ke jariye sampark cat gaya tha or ve alag-thalag pad gaye the
 In such an emergency, at least two important schemes are still stuck in red tape
 2003 main antariksh vibhaag kii ore se prastaavit upgrah aadhaarit sanchaar kii vyavastha 2005 tak sthapit ho jaani chahie thi
 But it is still stuck at the plan level, whereas in 2006 itself, Rs 6 crore
 ke jaruri upkaran manga liye gaye the
 It is being planned to build a national disaster communication network since 2007
 yahaan tak ki aasaan samaadhaan, jaise satellite phone tak nahin kharide gaye the
 a week after the disaster, the Ministry of Home Affairs hastily asked 200 satellite phones from Hong Kong and sent them to the NDRF battalion engaged in relief work in the state
 saste samaadhaan ke taur par sthaneey prasaaran suvidha ke bare main bhi vichaar nahin kiya
 It costs just one lakh to install an FM transmitter
 kii laagat aati he
 If the government wanted it could have been installed in every district so that messages could be sent on mobile phones
 centre-rajya ke bich talmail jarurigrih mantralay ne 2005 main pradhanmantri kii adhyakshata vaali ek sarvocch sanstha banaai thi, taaki desh main rashtriya aapadaa ke samay kendriya rup se bachaav kaa kaam kiya ja sake
 Five major disasters have occurred in eight years, but the NDMA has completely failed in its objective
 april 2013 main sansad main pesh kii gai lekha mahaniyantrak (sieji) kii report kahati he, ‘‘endieme ko zyaadaatar kshetron main beasar paaya gaya
 "10 important plans were either left incomplete or they were running way behind schedule
 endieme ke ek varisht adhikari kehete hai ki ve isliye peeche chal rahi hai ki rajya ke prashasan par unka koi niyantran nahin hota
 He says, "we don't have the right to audit them
" ham yojana puri na hone par jimmedaar adhikariyon ko kuch nahin kah sakate
 Even we cannot speak them to follow the guidelines
 ’’rashtriya aapadaa prabandhan kanoon kii adhisuchana chah saal pehle jari ho gai thi, lekin vinaash kii taiyaari ke liye rashtriya yojana ab tak taiyaar nahin hui he
 The most important of these was to create a unified command to connect all resources, people, materials and machinery in times of crisis
 rashtriya aapadaa taiyaari kaa lekha taiyaar nahin kiya ja sakaa he, kyonki kendriya grih sachiv kii adhyakshata vaali neshnal agxcutive cameti kii baithak haal ke maheenon main nahin hui he
 Build a rescue structure In Uttarakhand, helicopters engaged in rescue operations had no means of contacting people trapped in the mountains
 kai varshon se duniyabar main aapadaa ke samay bachaav karne vaali timen dhwani upkarnon se las helicopteron kaa istemaal karti thim
 These devices can send rescue instructions covering a much larger area affected by disaster
 in helicopteron dwaara utaare jane vaale tokari jaise plateform se duniyabar main bahut se logon kii jaan bachaai ja chuki he
 Only one chopper in Uttarakhand had such a facility
 in bachaav agenciyon ke paas jivan rakshak upkarnon main se bahut-se upkaran nahin the, jaise portable pul, jinhen helicopter se neeche laayaa ja saktaa tha, radimaid sookhaa bhojan, gas mask, saura urja se chalane vaale bade water filter plant or behad halke thermal kambal va waterpruf chaadaren
 Even if the devices were bought somewhere, they were not even used like synthetic aperture radar for 20 crore
 main kharida gaya tha
 This radar is used to warn of flooding but has not been used yet
 yahaan tak ki chetavanee dene vaala buniyadi upkaran bhi nahin he, jabaki use disambar 2004 kii sunami ke baad kharida janaa tha
 So far 147 sirens have not been established in the Nicobar Islands
 ye siren sunami se pehle logon ko bhaagane kii chetavanee de sakate hai
 It is a symbol of how careless we are even now in matters of disaster management
 duniyabar ke cricket premiyon ko jahaan sachin tendulkar ke mahashatak kaa intjaar he vahiin australian cricket premiyon kii najar riki ponting par tiki thi jo lagbhag pichley do saal se test maichon main tihare ank main nahin pahunch paae hai
 The former Australian captain failed to score a century despite a good start in the first innings of the first Test cricket match against India
 jab lag rahaa tha ki ponting pichhali 31 pariyon se shatak nahin jamaa paane ke dabaav se paar paakar tihare ank main pahunchane main safal rahenge tabhi tej gendbaaj umesh yadav kii uthati gend par unhone slip main vivies lakshmana ko kaich thama diya
 Ponting scored 62 runs before being dismissed
 ponting ne apana aakhri shatak janvari 2010 main pakistan ke khilaaf hobart main banaaya tha
 After this, he has scored only eight half-centuries in 32 innings
 unhone hobart ke is match kii duusari pari main 89 ran banaae the
 After this Test match, Australia's most successful batsman has played 28 of the 31 innings in 17 Tests
 63 kii ausat se 859 ran hi bana paae hai or unka sarvaadhik score 78 ran he
 Not only this, in this match Ponting came down to bat at number four, while his favorite place in the batting order is three
 ponting ne number teen par balalebaaji karte hue 32 shatak lagaae hai lekin number chaar par vah kabhi saikadaa nahin laga paae hai
 His highest score at this number is 78, which he recently scored against New Zealand in Brisbane

 Along with this picture, he has also given a special message to the new parents especially the fathers
 unhone pita banane vaale sabhi purushon ko apni patni kaa saath dene ko kaha he
 He wrote in the post, 'new Dads (fathers) and lovely people, this is World Breastfeeding Week and this post is to tell you that you are the biggest supporter and encouragement of your child's mother
 ek maa udhaas ho sakati he, aatmavishvaas main kami, chintit yaa tanavagrast ho sakati he or ye brestfding ko prabhavit kar saktaa he
 These points do not directly affect milk production within the mother, but there may be changes in her response to the child
 iskaa rigelt ye hoga ki baccha kam doodh piega or milk production main bhi samasya ho sakati he
 So you stay with his (wife)
 'view this post on instagramnew dads & loved ones listen up! Its World Breast feeding week and this post is for you to know that you can be the biggest support and encouragement to a new mom! a mother may be depressed, lacking in confidence, worried, or stressed and it affects breastfeeding
 These factors do not directly affect her milk production, but can interfere with the way in which she responds to her baby
 This can result in the baby taking less milk, and failing to stimulate milk production
 So be there for her
 ❤️ Understanding the pressure on her physically and emotionally is the best thing you can do
 Nothing like feeling loved at such an overwhelming time
 🙌🏻 
 i would also like to give a shoutout to moms who have struggled with low milk production
 This could happen due to a pathological reason including endocrine problems or a host of other factors 
 a few mothers have a physiological low breast-milk production, for no apparent reason, and production does not increase when the breastfeeding technique and pattern improve
 There is no reason to shame them or make them feel any pressure in not being able to BF
 we need to support all mothers and show love and respect 🍼

 Even though such incidents are exaggerated in the media, they remain a thrill in cricket

 com / guetl76xiwwhoever wishes you with HBD HBD HBD on your birthday, just note their names and on their anniversary wish them HA HA HA # virukagyaan indrani or peter mukherjee kii beti vidhi mukherjee ne sibiai ko bataaya ki april, 2012 main shina bora ke laapata hone ke baad jab usne sampark karnaa chaha to use shina ke naam se bani ek nai i-mail idi se jawaab mila
 This further strengthens the cbi's case that her mother Indrani, after killing Sheena in April 2012 and locating her body, used to send e-mail and text messages in her name
 maamle kii jaanch sibiai ke paas aane ke baad usne vidhi kaa bayaan darj kiya tha
 She also said that she used to get angry whenever she asked Indrani about Sheena
 vidhi ke anusaar, indrani ne use bataaya ki shina ne america ke kisi hira vyapaaree se vivaah kar liya he
 Vidhi said in a statement, the police informed me and my father (peter) that Sheena Bora was killed on April 24, 2012, and in this regard my mother (indrani), driver Shyam Rai and my biological father Sanjeev a case has been registered against Khanna
 maine sanjeev khanna se sampark kiya or hatya tathaa us aparaadh main unki sanliptata ke bare main poocha
 He took it very lightly and said 'ha ha ha' and disconnected the phone
 tippaniyan Vidhi told the CBI, 'in the year 2009, Sheena started living with us in Mumbai
 phir use mujhe, meri maa kii bahan ke rup main milwaaya gaya
 Then i came to know that Sheena and Rahul (her son from Peter Mukherjee's first marriage) have a love affair
 iske kaaran peter or indrani main bahut jhagade hua karte the
 My mother does not like Rahul
 vidhi ne kaha, varsh 2009-10 ke bich, mujhe pataa chalaa ki shina meri maa kii beti he, jaisaa ki rahul ne mere pita peter ko bataaya tha
 i asked my mother and she shouted that Rahul is lying and wants his father Peter to divorce them (indrani)
 yah sibiai ke cese ko or majboot karti he ki april, 2012 main shina kii hatya karne or uske shav ko thikaane lagane ke baad uski maa indrani, uske naam se i-mail or text massej bheja karti thi
 After the investigation of the case came to the CBI, he recorded a statement of law
 usne yah bhi kaha tha ki vah jab bhi indrani se shina ke bare main puuchhati vah naaraaz ho jaati thi
 According to the law, Indrani tells her that Sheena has married a diamond merchant in the US
 vidhi ne ek bayaan main kaha, police ne mujhe or mere pita (peter) ko suchit kiya ki 24 april, 2012 ko shina bora kii hatya ho gai he or is sambandh main meri maa (indrani), driver shyaam raay or mere biological pita sanjeev khanna ke khilaaf maamla darj ho gaya he
 i contacted Sanjeev Khanna and asked him about the murder and his involvement in that crime
 unhone ise bahut halke main liya or kaha 'ha ha ha' or phone kaat diya
 The comments vidhi ne sibiai ko bataaya, 'varsh 2009 main, shina hamaare saath mumbai main rahane lagi
 Then she was introduced to me as my mother's sister
 tabhi mujhe pataa chalaa ki shina or rahul (peter mukherjee kii pehali shaadi se uskaa betaa) ke bich prem sambandh he
 Due to this, there used to be a lot of quarrels between Peter and Indrani
 meri maa rahul ko pasand nahin karti he
 Vidhi said, between 2009-10, i came to know that Sheena is my mother's daughter, as Rahul told my father Peter
 maine apni maa se poocha or usne chillaate hue kaha ki rahul jhooth bol rahaa he or chahta he ki uske pita peter unhen (indrani) ko talaak de den

 The Taliban on Wednesday fired rockets at the Jirga, a panchayat of tribal leaders convened by President Hamid Karzai, as part of efforts to make peace in Afghanistan, and tried unsuccessfully to disrupt the meeting with a suicide attack
 karaji or bhartiya rajdoot jayant prasad un lagbhag 1500 logon main shaamil the jo is ghatana main surakshit batch gaye jisamen do hamalavar maare gaye or paanch afgaan surakshakarmi ghayal ho gaye
 Sources said as soon as President Karzai arrived to address the 'jirga', two rockets fell on the huge tent where delegations including several senior diplomats were present
 lekin iske baavjood karaji ne apni baat jari rakhte hue kabyli netaaon se upaay sujhane ke liye kaha jisase desh main yuddh khatm ho sake or shanti kaayam kii ja sake
 As Karzai concluded his address, two suicide bombs exploded about 200 meters away from him, shaking the stage
 sutron ne bataaya ki hamalaavaron ne jirga tak pahunchane kii koshish kii lekin jab unhen roka gaya, unhone khud ko dhamaake se uda diya
 He said that one of the President's guards, two soldiers of the Afghan Directorate General of Defense and two army personnel were injured in the attack
 sutron ne bataaya ki taliban ke do aatankwaadi paas ke ek ghar main ja chupe
 One of them was seriously injured by the security forces while the other was arrested
 sankat kii ashanka ke maddenjar jirga kii suraksha ke liye lagbhag 12,000 surakshakarmiyon ko tainaat kiya gaya tha
 The Taliban has already rejected the jirga, saying it is just propaganda
 taliban kaa kahana he ki america netritv waal sanybal jab tak afghanistan se nahin jaataa, tab tak koi shanti vaarta nahin ho sakati
 Karzai appealed to the Jirga representatives to advise on how to end the ongoing violence in the country and how to disarm the Taliban
 unhone kaha, ‘desh aapaki or aapaki salaah kii ore dekh rahaa he, taaki use shanti kaa rasta mil sake or afghanistan ko is pidaa tathaa dukh se bachaaya ja sake
 Hundreds of people, dressed in tribal costumes and turbans, sat in different rows

 Early stage ceremonies are still carried out on behalf of both countries at a small level

 With this, more and more people will reach here on the lines of the Wagah border
 yah ilaaka aazaadee ke pehle kaa vah ilaaka he jahaan bharat se sialkot ke liye sadak maarg bana hua tha, jiske jariye afghanistan ke raste hote hue ek vyapaarik maarg tha
 This place has been chosen for the Beating Retreat Ceremony so that people of both countries can come here and understand each other

 The show of friendship has always been on display in the midst of a tense atmosphere since Partition
 seremani kii shuruyaat main aakarshak veshbhusha main saje bachche deshbhakti vaale gaanon par prastuti dete hai
 After this the Beating Retreat Ceremony lasts about 156 seconds
 is dauraan, donon deshon ke jawan march karte hue border tak aate hai
 After this, 2 commanders and 6 soldiers of BSAF and Rangers join it from India and Pakistan
 is dauraan donon deshon ke guard naak se naak kii barabari tak aate hai
 The higher their legs are taken during the march, the better it is considered
 donon deshon ke javaanon kii joshbhari aawaaj or parade kii dhamak se kuch aisa maahaul ban jaataa he ki seremani dekhne vaale josh or deshbhakti se bhar uthte hai
 It seems the patriotic slogans of BSF and Pak Rangers jawans will start cheering every time they shout loudly, the more the crowd of the audience cheers them
 jawan ek-duusare desh se behatar pradarshan kar saken
 After this, the jawans take off the national flag of their country together in a very surprising style
 sabase aakhir main, jawan kabhi behad saralata se to kabhi behad gusse se ek-duusare ko dekhte hue haath milaate hai
 After this the doors of both countries are closed
 kuch isi tarj par jammu kashmir ke octry kii seremani main donon desh ke jawan apana jalawaa bikharenge
 The soldiers have to face a lot of problems due to the tradition of throwing shoes during the special shoesbeating retreat in March
 march karne vaale biguef ke javaanon ne shikaayat kii thi ki unhen ghutanon main dard or qamar se judi kai pareshaaniyon se do-chaar hona padataa he
 For this, the Government of India and BSF have provided special shoes to the jawans
 in khaas tareeke ke juuton se BSF jawan jab beating retreat main pair patakate hai to unke ghutanon main dard nahin hota he
 Due to this, there is more excitement in the soldiers

 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne loksabhaa chunaav se pehle bada daanv khelte hue desh ke sabase garib 20 fisadi logon ke liye nunatam aay sunishchit karne kaa elaan kiya he
 The scheme has been named 'nyaya' under which it has been announced to give Rs 72000 annually to the poorest 5 crore families in the country
 is lihaaj se is yojana par 3
 60 lakh crores is estimated to be spent
 congress kii is ghoshnaa ke baad yah bahes chhidi he ki is yojana ko chalaane ke liye itani badi rakam kahaan se aegi or iskaa desh kii arthvyavastha par kaisaa prabhaav padegaa?congress kii ghoshnaa par tippanee karte hue niti ayog ke upaadhyaksh rajeev kumaar ne kaha, '2008 main tatkaaleen vitt mantri pi
 Chidambaram to financial losses2
 5 fisadi se badhaakar 6 fisadi tak le gaye
 This announcement is like moving on the same pattern
 rahul gandhi arthvyavastha par padane vaale iske prabhaav kii chintaa kiye bina ghoshnaa kar baithe
 If this scheme applies then we will go four steps further
 ' haalanki congress party kaa kahana he ki yah yojana bajet neutral (bajet neutral wo avadharana he jisamen kisi yojana kaa prabhaav bajet par nahin padataa) hogi or vittiya ghate ko dhyaan main rakhte hue taiyaar kii jaaegi
 Jayati Ghosh, professor and development economist at Jawaharlal Nehru University, says that the 'nyaya' scheme being budget neutral means that the scheme will be funded by cutting from other schemes
 to pehla sawaal to yahi he ki congress ko yah spasht karnaa chahie ki wo kin yojanaon main katautee karne ja rahi he? duusari sabase badi baadha yah pataa lagaana he ki kiski aamadani kya he, kyonki log yojana ke bare main jaanate hi apni aay chhipaane lagenge
 The third challenge is that when people start getting money without working, why should people do the work? Fourth, how to spend the money that the government gives? Fifth, where will the money for the scheme come from? Professor Jayati Ghosh says that it would have been better if the Congress party had talked about making public services - health, education, nutrition etc
 accessible to all
 iske saath hi gramin or shahari vayaskon ko rojgaar kii guarantee kaa vaada karti or jo kinhin kaarnon se kaam nahin kar paa rahe unhen pension detii
 These three steps could have guaranteed minimum income
 haalanki, jayati ghosh kaa maananaa he ki is yojana kii ghoshnaa se chhidi bahes se yah to spasht ho gaya he ki sirf aarthik vruddhi hone se sab kuch thik ho jayega, yah avadharana kori bakawaas thi
 The biggest question in the debate over the justice scheme is, where will the money come from for the scheme and what will be its impact on the fiscal deficit? Professor Arun Kumar at Jawaharlal Nehru University says that 3 to be spent on this scheme
 60 lakh karod hamaari jidipi kaa 1
 8 percent
 agar raajnneetik ichhashakti hogi to hamaari arthvyavastha se itnaa paisa nikaala ja saktaa he
 Demonetisation and GST have adversely affected the economy and deepening poverty
 isaki chintaa sabko he
 This is the reason why the Central Government announced Rs
 75000 crore in its budget to give a support amount of Rs
 6000 to small and marginal farmers annually
 jahaan tak sawaal he ki 'nyaay' yojana ke liye paisa kahaan se aayega, to hamen dhyaan dena chahie ki abhi kuch dinon pehle yah report ai thi ki desh ke sabase amir 9 logon ke paas desh kii 55 fisadi velth he
 There are 150 billionaires in India to date, more than in Japan
 jabaki japan kii parcapita inakam ham se 30 guna he
 In this context, economic inequality in the country has increased continuously
 sarkaar chaahe to 
 1 by levying a 5 percent wealth tax
 50 lakh karod rupee is yojana ke liye nikaal sakati he
 Also Prof
 arun kumaar kaa kahana he ki tex main chhot hamaari jidipi kaa 6 fisadi yani 5-6 lakh karod rupye he
 It cannot be finished, but it can be reduced
 kelkar cameti kii report main bhi yahi kaha gaya tha ki sarkaar tex rate kam kare or tex main chhot ghataae
 At least 1 lakh crore can be raised by doing so
 centre sarkaar ne pehle se hi garib kisaanon ke liye 75000 karod kaa praavdhaan kar rakhaa he, ise bhi isamen shaamil kiya ja saktaa he
 Therefore, if there is political will, money can be raised for the scheme and it will not have any effect on the financial deficit
 nyaay yojana se desh kii arthvyavastha par padane vaale prabhaav ke sawaal par professor arun kumaar kaa kahana he ki is yojana ke lagu hone logon kii kray shakti badhegi jisaki vajah se thodi bahut mahangaai bhi bad sakati he
 But this will have a positive effect that farmers will also start getting the right price for their crop, which is still not available
 iske saath hi sust pade chote-majhole udyogon kii gati bhi badhegi
 Due to which employment will also increase and government's tax collection will also increase
 arthshaastriyon or jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki nyaay yojana kii ghoshnaa se desh main asamanta, amiri or garibi ko lekar ek bahes chhidi he
 So that something better will come out
 lekin jaankaron kaa yah bhi maananaa he ki is tarah kii yojanaon ko lekar saavdhaanee bhi baratani hogi kyonki duniya main is tarah kaa koi model nahin he jahaan itane bade paimaane par nunatam aay jaisi yojana chalaai ja rahi ho
 Therefore, policy controllers also have to be very careful
 chaaval kaa istemaal twachaa kii dekhbhaal ke liye bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 Many supermodels and actresses give priority to home remedies for skin care and cooked rice water is also special
 saptaah main ek baar iskaa istemaal karenge to beauty se judi kai samasyaon kaa nidaan aasaani se ho jayega
 Actually, the use of maad enhances the complexion of the skin
 chehre ke daag-dhabbon or jhurriyon ko bhi dur karne main bhi chaaval pakane ke baad bachaa pani madadgaar hota he
 Apart from this, the skin tightens and the pores are tight with the head
 isamen lavan, vitamin or anti-oxident kii paryaapt maatra hoti he, jisase twachaa main nami barkaraar rahati he
 Due to these characteristics, this mod is also a good cleanser
 jaaniye iske istemaal kaa sahi tarika:pehla charan:ek cap chaaval ko acchhee tarah saaf kar len or pani se dho len
 Second step: Now pour water in a vessel containing rice in proportion to its cooking
 ise chaaval kii maatra se dogune se thodaa zyada rakhen or is aadhe ghante ke liye bartan ko dhakkar rakh den
 This will dissolve the nutrients present in the water in the rice
 aadhe ghante ke baad is bartan ko gas par rakh den or chaaval pakane den
 Third step: After cooking the rice, take out its model and allow this water to cool
 baad main is pani se apane chehre par halke haath se massage kar len
 Fourth step: After massaging for about 10 minutes, wash your face with this water and wipe the face with a clean dry cloth
 aapako twachaa main aayaa badlaav turant najar aayega
 Fifth step: Many people also use this water to shine in the cobals
 haalanki maad kaa istemaal karne se pehle chikitsak kii salaah jarur len

 taapasi ne kaha "mujhe yaad he ki shoot se ek din pehle main apane aapako is baat ke liye samajha rahi thi ki mujhe aise diggaj abhinayta ke saamne saamaanya rahanaa he
 The actress said, "the next morning with Bhagya, the scene with Amitabh was quite normal
 haalanki mere liye yah saamaanya sa drishy film kaa sabase mushkil drishy ban gaya
 " taapasi ne kaha ki unke liye yah kirdaar kaaphi chunauteepurn tha, kyonki unhen isamen ek 'tromatiped sexuali wailated' ladki kaa kirdaar nibhaana tha
 He said that from the beginning, the film's co-producer Shoojit and director Anirudh had made it clear that his character would not shed tears, even if he had to go through any violence or trouble
 adaalat main nyaayadhish ke faisla sunaane ke baad bhi is kirdaar ko nahin ronaa tha
 Tapasi tried to play this character optimally, overcoming her feelings
 unhone kaha "kam se kam rup main bhaawanaaon ko darshane kaa prabhaav kaaphi alag tha
 We do not have to keep emotions in Indian cinema
 ise jitna ho sake, darshana hota he
 During the shoot of 'pink', i realized that more and more things have to be controlled
 " Taapsee also says that for the first time in this film she did not use any type of makeup and she liked it very much

 She does not use makeup in her real life at all

 He says that in many ways the character played in 'pink' is very close to his real life
 haalanki unhen is prakaar kii kisi bhi cheez kaa saamana nahin karnaa padaa

 ) Taapsee said "I remember that one day before the shoot i was explaining myself that i have to be normal in front of such a veteran actor
 " abhinetri ne kaha, "bhagya se agali subah meraa amitabh ke saath drishy kaaphi saamaanya tha
 However, for me this simple scene became the most difficult scene of the film
 " Taapsee said that this role was quite challenging for her, as she had to play a 'traumatized sexually violet' girl in it
 unhone kaha ki shuru se hi film ke sah-nirmaataa shoojit or nirdeshak aniruddh ne is baat ko saaf kar diya tha ki unka kirdaar aansu nahin bahaayega, phir chaahe unhen kisi bhi hinsa yaa pareshaani se guzarana pade
 The character did not cry even after the judge delivered the verdict in court
 taapasi ne apni bhaawanaaon par kaabo pate hue behtareen rup se is kirdaar ko nibhaane kaa prayaas kiya
 He stated "the effect of depicting emotions was quite different, at least in form
 bhartiya cinema main hamen bhaawanaaon ko apane bas main nahin rakhana hota
 It has to be shown as much as possible
 'pink' kii shooting ke dauraan mujhe is baat kaa ahsaas hua ki isamen zyada se zyada in chizon ko niyantrit karnaa he
 " taapasi kaa yah bhi kahana he ki is film main unhone pehali baar kisi bhi prakaar ke mechap kaa istemaal nahin kiya or unhen kaaphi acha laga
 She considers the dressing done by the girls to look good on camera
 vah apane asal jivan main mechap kaa bilkul bhi istemaal nahin karatin
 They do not even know to apply eye liner on their eyes
 unka kahana he ki kai prakaar se 'pink' main nibhaayaa gaya kirdaar unke asal jivan ke kaaphi kareeb he
 However, he did not face any such thing
 tippaniyan Talking about the possibility of getting the award for the character played in 'pink', Taapsee said that people had expressed similar hope after 'baby'

 Then it turns to three o'clock

 Was this done so that the coverage of the rally or the announcements made in it were not affected? It is better that the commission take its headquarters to the BJP office
 nayaa bhi he or new india ke hisaab se bhi
 The Chief Election Commissioner will sit there with a party secretary and decide the timing of the press conference
 desh kaa samay bhi barbaad nahin hoga
 The commission should also declare itself the election in-charge of the BJP
 kya farq padataa he
 Also give an excuse to extend the time of the press conference
 kuch bolnaa hi he to bolne main kya jaataa he
 This institution is constantly playing with its credibility
 gujarat vidhansabha kii tarikh tay karne ke maamle main yahi hua

 na jane kitne sarkari camere lagaakar us road sho kaa kawarej kiya gaya
 There is already doubt about EVM machine
 aaj ek raily ke liye ayog ne press conference kaa samay badha kar khud ishaara kar diya he ki ham ab bharose ke qaabil nahin rahe, bharosa mat karo
 If the people sitting on the post like Chief Election Commissioner, will reduce the credibility of the institutions in this way, then what will be left in this country? The comments isliye behatar he chunaav ayukta bench kursi lekar bijepi ke nae daphtar main chale jaaen
 If there is no place, then there is a park outside, put a chair there and work
 maalik ko bhi pataa rahegaa ki sevak kitna man se kaam kar rahaa he
 How are these people who have no backbone, how do they reach even? Then why is the commission doing the press conference gimmick? The release will be read at the same rally sent to the Prime Minister
 dekho janata dekho, sab lut rahaa he ankhon ke saamne
