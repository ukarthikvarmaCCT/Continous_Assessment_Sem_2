 That is, this year, recruitment has doubled compared to the average of the last four years
 kaash rail mantri in bhartiyon ko chah maheene main puraa karke dikhaa dete
 The average time of completion of recruitments would be reduced to 6 months, which is currently 2 to 3 years
 bilkul ho saktaa he
 What an energetic minister like him cannot do
 vaise abhi tak nahin hua, prabhu ji nahin kar paae to iskaa matlab yah nahin ki piyush goyal se nahin hoga
 Compliments of millions of students will be received
 jo bhi he teen saansadon kii badaulat railway main bhartee ko lekar aapke paas kam se kam kuch thos aankada to aa gaya
 That is why they thank you
 kya vaaki railway main staff kii baari kami nahin he, is par rail union kaa kya kahana he
 SSC exams are always in dispute
 iske pariksha kendron kaa bhi haal lenaa zaruri ho gaya he ki pariksha hoti kahaan hai
 What kind of centers are there? is bich aapako pataa hi he ki esayssi sijiel 2015 or 16 kii pariksha kaa nateeja agast se aktubar 2017 ke bich aa chukaa tha
 But he did not join till the end of January
 15000 se adhik chaatr pareshaan gum rahe the
 Our series started about this
 hamane aapako bataaya tha ki 11,000 naujavaanon kii jwining kii prakriya shuru hui he
 But students have started messaging about it that someone has gone medical but is not getting the letter, so after getting the joining cadre of someone, it is stuck
 phir bhi maamla aage badha he to chaatr khush hai
 In the Department of Post, the students selected for the post of accountant are growing eagerly when their letter will come
 somvaar 5 march ko jab excise or custom vibhaag main inakam tex inspector or tex clerk kii jwining kii prakriya shuru ho gai
 Their number is 1635 only
 ye chaatr bahut khush hai
 First pass the exam in three years, then pass and wait for joining for seven to eight months
 kitna torchar hota hoga
 Do you know at which centers SSC exam takes place
 kuch to bade centre hote hai jo iti companiyon kii hoti he, lekin bahut centre kaa haal dekhakar aap hairaan rah jaaenge ki lakhon chaatro ke bhavishya ke saath aisa khilwaad kaise ho saktaa he
 We do not want to go through the process of choosing the center, but we want you to visit these centers
 gauge len
 See what kind of fun your kids are having
 pehle ye video dekhie, elahabaad main 5 or 6 march ko chaatro ne esayssi ke intazaamon ke kilaaf pradarshan kiya, raily nikaali or dharna bhi diya he
 The slogan of their rally is first they have fought the whites and now they will fight with the thieves
 ab aate hai pariksha centre ke sawaal par
 Students have raised questions about many centers
 banaras main hamaare sahyogi ajay singh ne khud jaakar maukey par kai centaron ko check kiya he
 Many centers run in rented computer institutes in small homes
 baithne kii jagah nahin hoti, inkaa pataa bhi mushkil se miltaa he
 The setting in these centers increases the scope of copying
 pehle pariksha subjective hoti thi to skool college main hoti thi, jab se abjective pattern aayaa he tab se computer centre main hone lagi he
 These centers are being outsourced
 varanasi ke cigara ilaake ke is centre ko dekhie
 This is a hardware institute, the examination is also being done here
 chote se jagah main chal rahe is institute main role number get par laga he
 Examination is going on inside
 chaatr kehete hai ki jo bheetar gaye hai ham dekh nahin paa rahe hai ki wo kya gul khilaa rahe hai
 Actually, due to the lack of centers, these examinations run in many shifts and for many days
 is vajah se bhi dhaandhlee ho jaati he or dhaandhlee kii afvaah bhi ud jaati he
 Ajay Singh talked to the coaching manager, you should listen yourself
 ham to ek shahar se bataa rahe hai
 The pictures that students have sent from many cities are horrifying
 aap yakeen nahin karenge itani badi pariksha kaa yah haal ho saktaa he
 When we do not have the resources, then why is there an on-line examination
 varanasi ke cigara ilaake main hi yah doosraa centre he
 a generator is placed on the road and a roll number and seating arrangement are listed on it
 is building main computer institute ke alaava hostel bhi he or duusari vyavsaayik gatividhiyaan bhi chalati hai
 This is the center of SSC
 yah building bhaajapa ke vidhayak kii he
 The name of the gate is also hung
 ravi treepathi ji bhadohi se bhaajapa ke vidhayak hai
 We do not say that he has any role, but seeing the name of the MLA hanged outside the examination center, rumors start to gain strength
 unki bliding main agar kiraaye par chalane vaale computer centre main esayssi kii pariksha hoti to chaatr swaabhaavik rup se andeh kar sakate hai
 SSC should be properly examined before placing centers in such places
 uttar pradesh main 12, 460 shikshakon kii bhartee kaa maamla ajeeb mode se guzarataa rahata he
 We have raised the issue of these teachers many times, but several hundred times more than that, these students have demonstrated to protest their demands
 sirf dharna pradarshan hi nahin balki in shikshakon ne apni ladaai adaalat main bhi ladi
 They also lose by winning from there
 3 november 2017 ko hoicourt ke single bench ne upi sarkaar se kaha tha ki 2 maheene main in shikshakon kii bhartee ho jaani chahie
 Two months were completed on 3 January 2018, but 12,460 teachers were waiting for reinstatement
 phir yah maamla division bench main suna gaya
 From there also these 12, 460 teachers won
 is baar hoicourt ne upi sarkaar se kaha ki 4 hafte ke bheetar bhartee kii prakriya shuru kiijie
 Four weeks were completed on 6 March
 chaatro ko kuch pataa nahin he
 Perhaps the government knows what no one knows
 tippaniyan In 2016, advertisements for the recruitment of 12, 460 teachers were released
 march 2017 tak isaki counselling chalati rahi
 By 18 March 2017, the entire district was cut off and merit list was made
 lekin 23 march ko yogi sarkaar ne in bhartiyon par roak laga di
 Since then, these youngsters have been performing on every occasion
 ye tasviren unheen ke pradarshnon kii he, unheen kii bheji hui he
 Even two and a half months from July 16, 2017 to September 3, 2017, staged a protest at the Lakshman Mela ground in Lucknow
 12, 460 shikshak court se jeet jate hai magar sarkaar se nahin jeet pate hai
 Meet all types of ministers, meet mps, but their recruitment process does not begin
 court kaa aadesh bhi lagu nahin ho pota he
 You are watching what is the condition of jobs
 ham 24 wein episod tak aa chuke hai
 Don't know how many episodes will go on, but there is no special change in the situation
 12, 460 shikshak court se do do baar mukadmaa jeet jate hai, magar un adeshon ke baad bhi naukari nahin milti he
 From 2014 to 2017, the total recruitments of group-c and Grud turned out to be 1 lakh 70 Hajakar 134
 ise aap chaar saal main baant den to 2014 se har saal nikalne vaali bhartiyon kii sankhya hoti 42, 533
 The number of recruitments released in 2018 is said to be 90,000
 yani isi saal bhartee pichley chaar saal ke ausat kii tulana main dabl nikali he
 i wish the Railway Minister could have completed these recruitment in six months
 bhartiyon ko puraa hone ke samay ke ausat ko 6 maheene par laa dete jo is vakt 2 se 3 saal he
 Exactly
 unke jaisaa urjavan mantri chaahe to kya nahin kar saktaa he
 Well, it has not happened yet, if Prabhu ji could not do it does not mean that Piyush will not be from Goyal
 lakhon chaatro kii duaen milenge
 Whatever it is, due to the three mps, you have at least some solid data about recruitment in the railway
 isliye inkaa shukriya to banataa hi he
 Is there really a huge shortage of staff in the railways, what does the union say on this
 esayssi kii pariksha hameshaa vivaadon main rahati he
 Its examination centers have also become necessary to know where the examinations take place
 kis tarah ke centre hote hai
 In the meantime, you know that the result of SSC CGL 2015 and 16 examinations came between August and October 2017
 magar janvari biit jane tak inaki jwining nahin hui thi
 More than 15000 students were wandering around
 isi ko lekar hamaari series shuru hui thi
 We told you that the process of joining 11,000 youth has started
 magar ise lekar bhi chaatr massej karne lage hai ki kisi kaa medical ho gaya he magar letters nahin mil rahaa he, to kisi kii jwining kader milane ke baad ataki hui he
 Still, the matter has moved forward, the students are happy
 department of post main acountint pad ke liye chune gaye chaatro kii besabri badhati ja rahi he ki unka letters kab aayega
 On Monday 5 March, when the process of joining the Income Tax Inspector and Tax Clerk in the Excise and Customs Department started
 inaki hi sankhya 1635 he
 These students are very happy
 pehle to pariksha paas kiijie teen saal main, phir paas kar jwining ke liye intazaar kiijie saat aath maheene
 What a torture it would be
 kya aap jaanate hai ki esayssi kii pariksha kin centaron par hoti he
 There are some big centers which belong to IT companies, but you will be surprised by seeing the condition of many centers, how can such a mess happen with the future of millions of students
 ham centre chunane kii prakriya main nahin janaa chaahate magar ham chaahate hai ki aap in centaron kaa muyna karen
 Take review dekhen ki aapke bacchon ke saath kis tarah kaa mazaaq ho rahaa he
 Watch this video first, on 5 and 6 March in Allahabad, students demonstrated against SSC arrangements, took out a rally and staged a sit-in
 inaki raily kaa naaraa he pehle lade hai goron se ab ladenge choron se
 Now come to the question of examination center
 kai centaron ko lekar chaatro ne sawaal uthaaen hai
 Our colleague Ajay Singh in Banaras has himself visited and checked several centers on the spot
 kai centre chote-chote gharon main kiraye par chalate vaale computer institute main chalate hai
 There is no place to sit, their address is also difficult to find
 in centaron main setting ke zarie nakal kii guzaaish bad jaati he
 Earlier the exam was subjective, then the school was in college, ever since the objective pattern has come, it has started happening in the computer center
 in centaron ko out sorce kiya jane laga he
 See this center of Sigra area of varanasi
 ye hardware institute he yahaan bhi pariksha ho rahi he
 In this small institution, the roll number is installed at the gate
 andar pariksha chal rahi he
 Students say that those who have gone in, we cannot see what they are feeding
 darasal centre kam hone ke kaaran ye parikshaayen kai paali main or kai din tak chalati he
 Because of this, there is rigging and rumors of rigging also fly away
 ajay singh ne koching manager se baat kii aap khud sun len
 We are telling from a city
 chaatro ne kai shaharon se jo tasviren bheji hai wo bhayaavah hai
 You will not believe that such a big test can happen
 jab hamaare paas sansaadhan nahin hai to phir aan line pariksha kii maaramaari kyon he
 This is the second center in Sigra area of varanasi
 sadak par janarator rakhaa he or usee par role number or sitting arrangement kii suchi chipka di gai he
 In addition to the Computer Institute, this building has hostels and other business activities
 yahi esayssi kaa centre he
 This building is of BJP MLA
 get par kaa naam bhi tanga he
 Ravi Tripathi is a BJP MLA from Bhadohi
 ham nahin kehete ki unki koi bhoomika he magar pariksha centre ke baahar vidhayak kaa naam tanga dekhakar afvaahon ko bal milane lagata he
 In their bleeding, students can naturally be suspicious if they had SSC examination in a rented computer center
 esayssi ko aisi jagahon par centre dene se pehle thik se jaanch kerani chahie
 The case of recruitment of 12, 460 teachers in Uttar Pradesh goes through a strange turn
 hamane in shikshakon kaa maamla kai baar uthaaya magar usase kai sau guna baar in chaatro ne apni maangon ko lekar dharna pradarshan kiya he

 Its counseling continued till March 2017
 18 march 2017 tak saare zile ke cat of gaye or merit list ban gai thi
 But on 23 March, the Yogi government banned these recruitments
 iske baad se ye noujvaan har maukey par pradarshan kar rahe hai
 These photos are of his performances, sent by him
 yahaan tak ki 16 july 2017 se teen sitambar 2017 tak dhai maheene lakhanu ke lakshmana mela maidan main dharna bhi diya
 12, 460 teachers win from the court but do not win from the government
 har tarah ke mantri se mil aate hai, saansadon se mil aate hai magar inaki bhartee kii prakriya shuru nahin hoti
 Court order also does not apply
 aap dekh hi rahe hai ki naukariyon kii kya haalat he
 We have come to the 24th episode
 pataa nahin kitne episod tak chalate chale jaaenge, lekin halaat main koi khaas badlaav nahin he

 esayssi ko aisi jagahon par centre dene se pehle thik se jaanch kerani chahie
 The case of recruitment of 12, 460 teachers in Uttar Pradesh goes through a strange turn
 hamane in shikshakon kaa maamla kai baar uthaaya magar usase kai sau guna baar in chaatro ne apni maangon ko lekar dharna pradarshan kiya he
 Not only the sit-in demonstration, these teachers also fought their battle in the court
 vahaan se jeet kar bhi ye haar jate hai
 On 3 November 2017, a single bench of the High Court had asked the UP government that these teachers should be recruited in 2 months
 3 janvari 2018 ko do maheene puure ho gaye magar 12,460 shikshak bahaali kaa intazaar karte rah gaye
 The case was then heard in the division bench
 vahaan se bhi ye 12, 460 shikshak jeet gaye
 This time the High Court asked the UP government to start the recruitment process within 4 weeks
 6 march ko chaar hafte puure ho gaye
 Students do not know anything
 shaayad sarkaar ko pataa ho jo kisi ko pataa nahin he
 The comments 2016 main 12, 460 shikshakon kii bhartee kaa vigyaapan niklaa tha
 Its counseling continued till March 2017
 18 march 2017 tak saare zile ke cat of gaye or merit list ban gai thi
 But on 23 March, the Yogi government banned these recruitments
 iske baad se ye noujvaan har maukey par pradarshan kar rahe hai
 These photos are of his performances, sent by him
 yahaan tak ki 16 july 2017 se teen sitambar 2017 tak dhai maheene lakhanu ke lakshmana mela maidan main dharna bhi diya
 12, 460 teachers win from the court but do not win from the government
 har tarah ke mantri se mil aate hai, saansadon se mil aate hai magar inaki bhartee kii prakriya shuru nahin hoti
 Court order also does not apply
 aap dekh hi rahe hai ki naukariyon kii kya haalat he
 We have come to the 24th episode
 pataa nahin kitne episod tak chalate chale jaaenge, lekin halaat main koi khaas badlaav nahin he
 12, 460 Teachers win two cases out of court, but do not get jobs even after those orders
 ab aate hai pariksha centre ke sawaal par
 Students have raised questions about many centers
 banaras main hamaare sahyogi ajay singh ne khud jaakar maukey par kai centaron ko check kiya he
 Many centers run in rented computer institutes in small homes
 baithne kii jagah nahin hoti, inkaa pataa bhi mushkil se miltaa he
 The setting in these centers increases the scope of copying
 pehle pariksha subjective hoti thi to skool college main hoti thi, jab se abjective pattern aayaa he tab se computer centre main hone lagi he
 These centers are being outsourced
 varanasi ke cigara ilaake ke is centre ko dekhie
 This is a hardware institute, the examination is also being done here
 chote se jagah main chal rahe is institute main role number get par laga he
 Examination is going on inside
 chaatr kehete hai ki jo bheetar gaye hai ham dekh nahin paa rahe hai ki wo kya gul khilaa rahe hai
 Actually, due to the lack of centers, these examinations run in many shifts and for many days
 is vajah se bhi dhaandhlee ho jaati he or dhaandhlee kii afvaah bhi ud jaati he
 Ajay Singh talked to the coaching manager, you should listen yourself
 ham to ek shahar se bataa rahe hai
 The pictures that students have sent from many cities are horrifying
 aap yakeen nahin karenge itani badi pariksha kaa yah haal ho saktaa he
 When we do not have the resources, then why is there an on-line examination
 varanasi ke cigara ilaake main hi yah doosraa centre he
 a generator is placed on the road and a roll number and seating arrangement are listed on it
 is building main computer institute ke alaava hostel bhi he or duusari vyavsaayik gatividhiyaan bhi chalati hai
 This is the center of SSC
 yah building bhaajapa ke vidhayak kii he
 The name of the gate is also hung
 ravi treepathi ji bhadohi se bhaajapa ke vidhayak hai
 We do not say that he has any role, but seeing the name of the MLA hanged outside the examination center, rumors start to gain strength
 unki bliding main agar kiraaye par chalane vaale computer centre main esayssi kii pariksha hoti to chaatr swaabhaavik rup se andeh kar sakate hai
 SSC should be properly examined before placing centers in such places
 uttar pradesh main 12, 460 shikshakon kii bhartee kaa maamla ajeeb mode se guzarataa rahata he
 We have raised the issue of these teachers many times, but several hundred times more than that, these students have demonstrated to protest their demands
 sirf dharna pradarshan hi nahin balki in shikshakon ne apni ladaai adaalat main bhi ladi
 They also lose by winning from there
 3 november 2017 ko hoicourt ke single bench ne upi sarkaar se kaha tha ki 2 maheene main in shikshakon kii bhartee ho jaani chahie
 Two months were completed on 3 January 2018, but 12,460 teachers were waiting for reinstatement
 phir yah maamla division bench main suna gaya
 From there also these 12, 460 teachers won
 is baar hoicourt ne upi sarkaar se kaha ki 4 hafte ke bheetar bhartee kii prakriya shuru kiijie
 Four weeks were completed on 6 March
 chaatro ko kuch pataa nahin he
 Perhaps the government knows what no one knows
 tippaniyan In 2016, advertisements for the recruitment of 12, 460 teachers were released
 march 2017 tak isaki counselling chalati rahi
 By 18 March 2017, the entire district was cut off and merit list was made
 lekin 23 march ko yogi sarkaar ne in bhartiyon par roak laga di
 Since then, these youngsters have been performing on every occasion
 ye tasviren unheen ke pradarshnon kii he, unheen kii bheji hui he
 Even two and a half months from July 16, 2017 to September 3, 2017, staged a protest at the Lakshman Mela ground in Lucknow
 12, 460 shikshak court se jeet jate hai magar sarkaar se nahin jeet pate hai
 Meet all types of ministers, meet mps, but their recruitment process does not begin
 court kaa aadesh bhi lagu nahin ho pota he
 You are watching what is the condition of jobs
 ham 24 wein episod tak aa chuke hai
 Don't know how many episodes will go on, but there is no special change in the situation
 12, 460 shikshak court se do do baar mukadmaa jeet jate hai, magar un adeshon ke baad bhi naukari nahin milti he
 See this center of Sigra area of varanasi
 ye hardware institute he yahaan bhi pariksha ho rahi he
 In this small institution, the roll number is installed at the gate
 andar pariksha chal rahi he
 Students say that those who have gone in, we cannot see what they are feeding
 darasal centre kam hone ke kaaran ye parikshaayen kai paali main or kai din tak chalati he
 Because of this, there is rigging and rumors of rigging also fly away
 ajay singh ne koching manager se baat kii aap khud sun len
 We are telling from a city
 chaatro ne kai shaharon se jo tasviren bheji hai wo bhayaavah hai
 You will not believe that such a big test can happen
 jab hamaare paas sansaadhan nahin hai to phir aan line pariksha kii maaramaari kyon he
 This is the second center in Sigra area of varanasi
 sadak par janarator rakhaa he or usee par role number or sitting arrangement kii suchi chipka di gai he
 In addition to the Computer Institute, this building has hostels and other business activities
 yahi esayssi kaa centre he
 This building is of BJP MLA
 get par kaa naam bhi tanga he
 Ravi Tripathi is a BJP MLA from Bhadohi
 ham nahin kehete ki unki koi bhoomika he magar pariksha centre ke baahar vidhayak kaa naam tanga dekhakar afvaahon ko bal milane lagata he
 In their bleeding, students can naturally be suspicious if they had SSC examination in a rented computer center
 esayssi ko aisi jagahon par centre dene se pehle thik se jaanch kerani chahie

 Film- Manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansiakalakar- Kangana Ranaut, Ankita Lokhande, Jissu Sengupta, Danny Denzongpa, Mohammed Zeeshan Ayub, Suresh Oberoi, Kulbhushan Kharbanda Others Directors- Kangana and Krushrating- 3 'tanu Weds Manu' directed by Anand L
 Rai and In 'tanu Weds Manu Returns', actress Kangana Ranaut had entertained everyone a lot
 film 'queen' main bhi kangana kii acting kii jamkar tarif hui thi
 Kangana is guaranteed to make the film a hit on her own
 hansaane, rulaane ke baad kangana kaa damdaar ection skill saamne aayaa he jo ki aapako film 'manikarnika: da queen of jhaansi' main dekhne ko miltaa he
 When the queen of Jhansi is mentioned, the matter will be of heroism and Kangana has left no stone unturned to energize this character
 film kaa nirdesan khud kangana or krish ne milakar kiya he
 Let's know how the film has become
 
 
 kya he film kii kahani?manikarnika ek period drama he
 The story of the film begins with the birth of Manikarnika (kangana Ranaut)
 kangana bachapan se shastr chalaane main behad hi nipun hai
 Seeing this same ability, the king of Jhansi, Gangadhar Rao (jissu Sengupta) comes into relationship and gets married
 shaadi ke baad unka naam 'lakshmibai' ho jaataa he
 Everything works fine rani lakshmibai jhaansi ko uskaa uttaradhikari detii he, jiskaa naam hota he 'damodar das raav'
 But he dies at just 4 months old
 iske baad gambhir beemaari se unke pati kaa bhi nidhan ho jaataa he
 Due to the death of the child and husband, the British try to capture Jhansi
 apane rajya ko bachaane ke liye rani lakshmibai jhaansi ke gaddi par baithti hai or elaan karti hai ki jhaansi kisi ko nahin dengi
 After this, how Rani Laxmibai fights the war and how she is martyred for her motherland, for this you have to watch the film
 vaise vistaar se film kii kahani aapako dekhne-sunne ke baad hi samaj aegi
 Why watch the film? For those interested in period films, the film is perfect
 film main bharpoor maatra main ection he
 Kangana's rage was seen
 film kaa becoground mujeec behad hi shandaar he, jisaki vajah se ection seens main jaan aati he
 Kangana was full of passion throughout the film
 movie kaa camera or viefex acha he
 The film is inspiring
 sabase zyada film main kisi cheez par focus kiya gaya he to wo he kangana ke luks
 From the entry to the end of her film, Kangana looks amazing
 danni denjongpa or mohammad jisaan ayub ne gajab kii adaakaari kii he
 The dialogues of the film are full of patriotic spirit and the dialogue is also good
 film ke sets par kaaphi kaam kiya gaya he
 Kangana has done a great job in terms of direction

 Why Green? Because eco-consciousness and fashion can co-exist with LIVA Eco! # kanganaranauta post shared bykangana Ranaut (@team_kangana_ranaut) onjan 19, 2019 at 8:41 am PST Why not watch the film's length is too big
 iske kaaran kai baar dhyaan bhatkaav sa bhi mahasoos ho saktaa he
 There are many dialogues in the film but there is no punch in them
 banaavati se bhi lagate hai
 In the second half of the film, an attempt has been made to bring the fun element of coercion, which is Akharata
 vahiin kangana main josh to bharpoor maatra main dikhaa he lekin unki aawaaj main fark saaf dikh rahaa tha
 Despite the use of technology, there are two types of differences in his voice in the film
 ankitha lokhande bhi apni debyue film main khaas kamaal nahin dikhaa pai
 His presence in the film was less
 aisa bhi lagata he ki ankitha chote parde vaale frem se abhi nikal nahin pai hai
 The film is not one in which all aspects have shown their presence simultaneously
 kahin ection he to mukhya kirdaar kii aawaaj damdaar nahin, kahin kirdaaron kii entry acchhee he to wo film ke bich main kahaan kho jate hai, pataa hi nahin chalata
 They were not established before the characters were introduced
 box offiskangana kii is film kii box offis par navazuddin kii thakare se takkar he
 Manikarnika's first day box office is expected to earn 13 to 15 crores
 lekin navaj kii thakare se ise nuksaan uthaanaa pad saktaa he
 Looking at 26 January, the film may get viewers in the early days in a patriotic atmosphere, but it is not certain that their arrival will be in the days ahead
 bevajaah sa he vivadfilm kaa virodh karne vaale sanghathanon kii ore se jhaansi kii rani ke romance, dance aadi par sawaal uthaaya he
 But you will find these controversies meaningless while watching the film
 gudgaanv kii ek nijee company main kaam karne vaali 27 saal kii ek yuvati se kathith taur par balaatkaar ke silsile main 'ubar' company ke ek driver kii giraftaar ke ek din baad dilli sarkaar ne aaj antarrashtriya cab booking seva 'ubar' par rashtriya rajdhani main pabandi laga di

 yadav (32) ko mathura se giraftaar kiye jane ke ek din baad dilli sarkaar ne 'ubar' ko kaali suchi main daal diya jisase yah company rajdhani main kisi tarah kii parivahan seva uplabdh nahin kara paaegi
 The government took this step when it was revealed that accused Shiv Kumar Yadav had spent seven months in jail in 2011 on rape charges
 haalanki, is maamle main use bari kar diya gaya tha
 The Delhi government said in a statement, 'transport Department has banned all activities related to providing transport service by' wwduberdotcom 'with immediate effect
 vibhaag ne company ko bhavishya main dilli ke rashtriya rajdhani kshetra main koi parivahan seva pradaan karne ke maamle main bhi kaali suchi main daal diya he
 ' dilli kii ek adaalat ne 32 saal ke yadav ko teen din kii police hiraasat main bhej diya

 police ne kaha ki ravivaar ko mathura main giraftaar kiye gaye yadav se poochtacha kii jarurat he taaki uske dwaara istemaal main laae gaye mobile phone ko baraamad kiya ja sake
 Official sources said that the Union Home Ministry is considering asking all state governments and the administration of the nine union territories to ban the company where 'uber' cab services are available
 'ubar' kii cab sevaayen bengaluru, mumbai, hyderabad, chennai, jaipur, ahmedabad, chandigarh, kolkata or pune main uplabdh hai
 Police said that during the investigation, prima facie it was revealed that criminal negligence was done by Uber
 jaanch ke dauraan kai tarah kii kathith khamiyaan saamne ai hai
 Neither the driver was given police verification nor the GPS device was installed in the car
 niyamon ke mutabik, sabhi nijee cab seva pradaataaon ke liye yah jaruri he ki vah driveron kii prishthbhumi kii jaanch or unka police satyaapan karaaen

 Congress candidate Rajendra Singh Parmar has won this seat
 unhen 86254 vot mili hai
 While BJP candidate Ramanbhai Solanki got 74786 votes

 Prior to this, Natwar Singh Thakor won elections on Congress ticket in 2002, 1998, 1995 and 1990
 haalanki, is baar congress ne indrajit ke rup main nayaa candidet utaara or unhone 78 hajaar vot pate hue jeet darj kii
 Vyara Seat is a part of Surat district of South Gujarat
 ye seat anusuchit janajati ke liye arakshit he

 bijepi aaj tak yahaan koi chunaav nahin jeet pai he
 This time Congress candidate from here, Gamit Punabhai Dhedabhai, has received 87140 votes
 jabaki unke virdohi bijepi candidet arvindabhai ruumasibhai choudhary ko 63677 vot mili hai
 Congress won from here in 1962, 1967, 1972, 1975
 iske baad 1980 indira gandhi kii congress ko yahaan se jeet hasil hui
 He was the Congress candidate winner in 1985
 iske baad 1990 or 1995 main yahaan se nirdaleey ummidavaar jite or phir 1998, 2002, 2004(upachunaav), 2007 or 2012 ke baad 2017 main bhi congress candidet ne hi jeet darj kii
 Jhagadia seat: Jhagadia seat of tribal dominated Bharuch district has also gone outside the purview of the main political party Congress and BJP to Janata Dal United account

 In 1998, Chhotubhai Vasava continued to win on Janata Dal and then on Janata Dal United ticket
 yani is seat se kabhi bhi bijepi ummidavaar ko jeet naseeb nahin ho pai he
 However, Congress has always won from 1985 and earlier

 a cocktail of drugs, rage and rasuk killed a TV journalist in Delhi
 ek news channel main kaam karne vaala hardip apane ghar main doston ke saath baitha hua tha
 Under his flat was a Raisjade's gym
 gym main sharaab kii party chal rahi thi, tej mujeec baj rahaa tha
 When Hardeep requested not to make noise from the people partying below, Raiszade did not tolerate this and shot the journalist
 hardip par thi puure parivaar kii jimmedaariye ghatana dilli ke posh vasant kunj ilaake kii he
 The incident is on Sunday
 30 saal kaa hardip kainyus channlonmen kaam kar chukaa tha or mata-pita kaa iklauta betaa tha
 There is a gym named Rinku under Hardeep's house and his liquor party was going on at around 10
30 pm
 hardip ne jab rinku ko shor-sharaaba na karne ke liye kaha to pehle to usne hardip ke saath gaali-galoch kiya
 After that Hardeep comes back to his room
 aspataal pahunchate hi dam todakuch der rinku bandook taane hardip ke kamare main pahunch gaya or marpet karne ke baad use goli maar di
 After this, Rinku went waving gun at Hardeep's friends present there

 hamaare ghar main hamaare alaava kai duusare chote-mote jeev rahete hai
 There are some creatures that do not harm us due to their existence, but there are others whose presence makes our house dirty
 yaa phir wo kisi beemaari kaa kaaran ban jate hai
 a spider is one such insect that weaves webs on the walls of the house, corners and dark places
 aamtaur par ye makadiyaan logon ko koi nuksaan nahin pahunchaati hai lekin kuch aisi bhi hoti hai jinke khuli twachaa par chal dene se us sthaan par fafola pad jaataa he
 Although there are many types of insecticides available in the market to keep these puckers away, but some of us feel that the use of pesticides can affect the health of them and other household members
 par aapako shaayad ye pataa nahin hoga ki makadiyon ko gharelu tareeke apanaakar bhi ghar se baahar kiya ja saktaa he
 1
 sabase pehle to makadi ke saare jaale saaf kar dijie
 Carefully clean the webs outside the house first because most spiders weave their webs outside the house
 deevaaron ke kone unke rahane kii sabase upyukt jagah hoti hai
 2
 ye sabase aasaan upaay he
 Try to clean the walls and hidden corners once by looking at the house while cleaning
 aisa karne se makadiyaan panpane hi nahin paaengi
 3
 ye sunishchit karnaa bahut jaruri he kiapake ghar kii koi diwaar tuuti-phooti na ho
 Nor should there be cracks in it
 aisi hi jagahon par makadiyaan sabase adhik panapati hai
 If there are cracks, fill them immediately
 4
 Vinegar is a substance that kills such pests but does not affect human health
 aap chahen to sirke ko ekkapade main dubokar un jagahon par rakh sakati hainjahan makadiyon ke hone kii sambhaavna adhik ho
 5
 baking soda ke istemaal se bhi makadiyaan bhaag jaati hai
 Spiders do not like the smell of which they run away from near baking soda
 6
 The use of citrus oil also leads to spiders fleeing home

 While leaders like Ramdas Athawale and Mayawati sharply criticized Nandi's statement, an FIR was lodged at the Ashok Nagar police station in Jaipur late evening under the Scheduled Castes / Tribes (SC / ST) Act and a section of the Indian Penal Code
 bayaan ko tool die jane ke baad nandi ne apni safai main kaha ki unke bayaan kaa aashay kisi varg vishesh kii bhaavana ko aahat karnaa nahin tha
 He said that his statement was misinterpreted
 udhar, mahotsav main tisare din vivaad or iske baad hangaamaa, glamer or khel, mahatma gandhi kaa yogadan, bhartiya asthirataa or ullas kaa mila jula vaataavaran chaaya rahaa
 In the session organized on the theme of 'republic of Ideas' at the festival, he said, "it will be indecent and unnatural statement
 lekin yah sach he ki sabase bhrasht vyakti obisi, essi or ab bade paimaane par asti se aa rahe hai
 And as long as this happens, the Indian Republic will be alive
 " unhone kaha, "main ek udhaaharan dena chaahunga
 The least corrupt state is West Bengal
 pichley 100 varshon main obisi, essi, asti varg ke log satta ke najadik bhi nahin pahunche
 It is a completely clean state
 " After this, after raising the opposing voice of the Dalit groups, he said in clear, "I believe that an autocratic society can only be a corruption-free society

 vishwa cancer diwas ke maukey par cancer visheshgy dinesh pendharkar bataate hai ki kai baar unke saamne ye sawaal aate hai ki mujhe cancer kaise ho saktaa he? main dhumrapaan nahin karata, main rojaanaa kasarat karata hum, main sahi khaanaa khaataa hum or main har saal apana swasthya jaanch karwaata hum
 When the cancer is confirmed, the distressed patients often say the same thing to me
 lekin vaastaviktaa yah he ki yah kisi ko bhi ho saktaa he
 Because we have pollution, pesticides and stressful life around us
 in sabake asar secancerpaida hota he jis par kisi kaa vash nahin he
 To avoid this, health checkup is fine from time to time but awareness and vigilance are equally important
 aaj vishwa cancer diwas he
 Cancer Day is observed every year on 4 February to spread awareness about it worldwide
 umr badhane ke saath badhata he canstygar hamaare sharir kii koi koshika swasthya jaanch ke agle din cancer grast ho jaati he to uskaa pataa hamen agle swasthya jaanch ke nattejey aane par chalegaa, joki aamtaur par saal bhar baad karavaaya jaataa he
 By then it is too late and it can spread to other parts of the body
 ham apane parivaar ke sadsy, kareebi dost, yaa sahakarmi ko jaanate honge jo is ghaatak beemaari kaa saamana kar rahe hai
 Therefore, as soon as its initial symptoms are seen, they should immediately see a trained cancer specialist (oncologist)
 har saal cancer ke lagbhag 11 lakh nae maamle saamne aa rahe hai
 Of these, 3
3 million people in India are battling cancer at any given time
 cancer umr badhane ke saath badhata jaataa he or budhaape main cancer hone kii sambhaavna kaaphi adhik hoti he
 Now, we can get a lot of information about cancer on the internet
 isliye ab hamamen se zyaadaatar cancer ke bare main anjaan nahin hai
 Scientists are constantly making new discoveries to prevent, investigate and treat it
 yahi kaaran he ki pehle kaha jaataa tha ki hamen saal main ek baar mammography jaanch jarur karavani chahie
 But now we can get it done once in two-three years
 vahiin, mammography ke liye umr seemaa ko bhi 40 se badhaakar 50 kar diya gaya he
 The first symptom of cancer is mild to deep pain in the affected area
 iske alaava ekaek akaaran vajan ghatana
 Abnormal enlargement of any part of the body, bleeding without reason, shortness of breath, loss of appetite, fever, or extreme tiredness
 cancer kaa ilaaj sambhavam dharna ke vipareet cancer ke ilaaj ke kai tareeke uplabdh hai
 It is dependent on the age of the patient, the intensity of the disease and the spread
 lekin ilaaj kaisaa ho yah koi anbhavi or kushal doctor hi bataa saktaa he
 Cancer treatment is different for every patient, this increases the patient's chances of staying alive for longer
 ab cancer kaa pataa shuruaati jaanch main hi lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Scientists are engaged in finding a permanent cure
 vahiin, ab cancer kaa behatar ilaaj uplabdh he
 Once the cancer is diagnosed, the patient needs treatment throughout his life
 maansik pareshaani sa jujhate hai cancer ke marizgin marijon kii cancer koshikaayen puri tarah hataa di gai hai or vah swasth ho gaya ho use bhi lagaataar swasthya jaanch kii jarurat padati he
 Most of the patients are suffering from mental problems due to cancer, who will see them if something happens suddenly
 isliye kuch saamaanya ilaaj jisamen kisi visheshgy kii jarurat nahin ho jaise tikaa lagaana, pani chadhaanaa ityadi ghar par hi kiya janaa chahie
 There is a need to provide cheap and better treatment at home to cancer patients in India and some companies are working in this direction
 jaise tracostomy management, stoma care, onko immergesi rikaganishan aadi
 These companies provide round the clock care to patients at home
 isliye ham is beemaari par vijay paane se pehle marijon or parijanon ke liye is beemaari se ladaai aasaan bana sakate hai
 Or at least relieve the fear of care during this disease

 India has now handed over the evidence to Pakistan
 imran khan ne guruuvar ko baqayada pakistani sansad main is baat kaa elaan kiya ki unhen bharat kii taraf se bheje gaye pulavama hamale ke saboot mil chuke hai
 Now the ball is in Imran Khan's court
 khan sahab pehle inkaa kuch karampulawama ke baad pakistan ke pradhanmantri imran khan ne kaha tha ki bharat unhen saboot de to ve guarantee dete hai ki karrwai karenge
 Dear sir kitne saboot lijiega
 Your shelves are filled with dossiers from India
 magar hindustan main maare gaye hazaron begunaahon ke khun ke ek bhi katare kaa hisaab nahin hua
 You tell me what has happened hota to kya pulavama se lekar sansad hamale tak kaa gunahagaar masood azhar bekhauf aapke mulk main gum rahaa hota
 Hafiz Saeed, the perpetrator of 26 / 11, would have been weaving dreams of becoming Prime Minister in your country
 ghati main naujavaanon ko bargalane vaala salauddin vahaan photo khichvaa rahaa hota
 And if Ratti was equally concerned about the dossier, Dawood Ibrahim, the mastermind of the 1993 Mumbai blasts, would not have been your guest
 paak piem imran khan ne kaha ki hamane sidhaa-sidhaa hindustan ko ofer kiya he ki agar aap kisi tarah kii investigation chaahate hai
 So Pakistan is fully willing to help
 14 pannon main darj he PAK kii karatukab agar aap sach main pulavama ke gunahagaaron kaa kuch karnaa chaahate hai to phir dekhie 14 panne ke us dogier ko jise bharat kii taraf se pakistan ko saunp diya gaya he
 It has every one of the actions of your country
 14 panne kii fil main pulavama hamale main jaish ke haath hone ke saboot maujuud hai
 Video tape is also accompanying Adil Dar as proof of his involvement with Jaish
 local fidaayin ko trend karne vaale gaazi ke bare main jaankariyaan hai
 There is evidence of Jaish commander Abdul Rashid Ghazi intruding into India
 pakistani dharti par pulavama hamale kii planning ke pukhta saboot hai
 Dar's statement in which he is proud of Jaish being a terrorist
 dhamaake main istemaal gaadi ke maalik sajaad bat ke bare main jaankariyaan hai

 javaabi karrwai main maare gaye kamran kii phone par baatcheet kii tronscript he

 Abdul Rashid Ghazi is the soldier who prepared the IED for the attack
 sajaad bat usee kaa karinda he jisane dhamaake ke liye istemaal car kaa intazaam kiya or kamran usee kaa commander he jo adil ke napak mansoobon main uske saath saath tha
 This dossier has been handed over to the Acting High Commissioner of Pakistan after covering the entire story of 14 pages in 14 pages with a strong demand from Pakistan
 saath hi dogier ke zarie bharat ne pakistan se sakht lahaze main kuch baaten bhi kahi hai
 From India it was said that Pakistan should ban the terrorist organization jaish-e-mohammed
 jaish sargana masood ajahar ko giraftaar kiya jaae
 Action should be taken in case of attack on Parliament House
 masood kii sampatti ko pakistan sarkaar zabt kare
 Action should also be taken in the case of Pulwama and Pathankot attacks
 pakistan apni jameen par aatankwaad ko band kare
 Strict action should also be taken against other terrorist organizations and mentors
 pulavama hamale ke baad vishwa str par bharat ne jis tarah apana rukh pesh kiya he usase saaf ho gaya he ki aatank par sachhee karrwai ke liye ab pakistan ke paas ye aakhri mauka he
 Because in future India will fight with weapons not with dossiers

 mauka tha 'india today anforgateble' kaa jahaan aamir khan or ranvir singh donon hi apni filmi kariyar par khulkar baat kar rahe the
 Aamir wanted to know from Ranveer that despite being from a non-film background, how did he achieve this position in the industry? In response to which Ranveer said, 'I didn't want to be an actor as much as i remember
 main sirf hindi filmon kaa hero bananaa chahta tha
 Neither Hollywood, nor off beat movies, only mainstream Hindi films attracted me
 '2016 main pehle din kii kamai ke maamle main ye filmein rahi top pararanvir ne kaha, 'film industry se naa hote hue yahaan apni ek jagah bananaa kisi ke liye bhi kaaphi mushkil he

 ' The Ayodhya case is on the 25th day of hearing in the Supreme Court
 muslim pakshakaron ke vakil rajeev dhawan apana paksh rakh rahe hai
 Rajiv Dhawan said that there is no dispute over the sanctity of Lord Rama
 isamen bhi vivaad nahin he ki bhagwaan ram kaa janm ayodhya main kahin hua tha
 But when will such sanctity be enough to turn a place into a judicial one? For this, there should be an expression like Mount Kailash
 isamen vishwaas kii nirantarata honi chahie or yah bhi dikhaaya janaa chahie ki nishchit rup se vahiin prarthana kii gai thi
 During the hearing, Dhawan, referring to the poetry of Allama Iqbal, described Rama as an Imam Hind and was proud of him
 lekin phir kaha ki baad main wo badal gaye the or pakistan ke samarthak ban gaye the
 During the hearing, Rajiv Dhawan also read in the court the famous lion of Allama Iqbal, 'hindustan is proud of Ram's existence
 
 
 ahal-e-nazar samajhate hai us ko imam-e-hind
 On this, Justice DY Chandrachud asked Rajiv Dhawan, are you saying that there should be some physical expression? Wouldn't it be very difficult to set parameters to make the place a person? Rajiv Dhawan replied to this, no texts are able to tell at which exact place in Ayodhya was Lord Rama born
 saath hi court ne rajeev dhawan se poocha ki bhagwaan kaa swayambhu hona kya saamaanya prakriya he? ye kaise sabit karenge ki ram kaa janm vahiin hua yaa nahin? dhawan ne kaha ki yahi to mushkil he
 The Shigufa of Ramjanmasthana was left by the East India Company in 1855 and the Hindus were allowed to worship at the Ramchabutra there
 ham or aap jaise tamaam aam log aksar is tarah kii baaten karte paae jate hai ki videsh main settle ho jaaen yaa duusare viksit desh suvidhaon ke maamle main bharat se kahin behatar hai
 In such a situation, no one raises a finger on our thoughts
 aam janata agar aisi baat kahe to koi controvarsi nahin hoti
 So why so much ruckus on Aamir's small statement? Just because he is a public figure? Shah Rukh Khan has recently given his statement on this matter
 unhen is baat se katai fark nahin padataa ki koun sa actor kya kah rahaa he yaa kya chahta he
 Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan stressed that like other professionals, actors should have the freedom to speak their mind
 aamir ke bayaan par soshal media par hue yuddh par baat karte hue shahrukh ne kaha,'hamen alag-alag muddon par baat karanichahie or unka hal nikaalane ke bare main sochna chahie
 The only meaning of freedom of expression is that you keep your opinion, another's opinion and Phil should discuss the subject together
 soshal media charchaaon kaa manch hona chahie na ki bahes yaa jajment yaa final disijan dene kaa manch
 Shah Rukh clearly said, 'if a person expresses his views on social media, it does not mean that he should understand the whole truth
 us par charchaa honi chahie
 But some foolish people start giving their judgments here

 Or they are trying to pressurize the Congress by talking to the Aam Aadmi Party, because it is possible that the Congress is not giving much consideration or big offer to them by believing that Sidhu and his colleagues have no choice but to join the Congress and Seeing this news that Sidhu has an AAP option, Congress should offer a new or better deal to Sidhu and his colleagues
 isse pehle buudhvaar ko ek news channel se baatcheet main aam aadmi party ke mukhiya or dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne kaha tha ki siddhu se unki baatcheet chal rahi he or ummid he wo hamaare saath aaenge
 It is natural to raise the question whether Sidhu and his colleagues do not feel right to go to the Congress or if they are not getting a good deal from the Congress
 yaa phir wo aam aadmi party se baat karke congress par dabaav bananaa chaah rahe hai kyonki ho saktaa he ki congress ye maanakar ki siddhu or unke saathiyon ke paas congress main aane ke alaava vikalp nahin he unako zyaada tavajjo yaa badi peshkash naa kar rahi ho or ye khabar dekhakar ki siddhu ke paas aap vaala vikalp maujuud he congress koi nai yaa acchhee deal siddhu or unke saathiyon ko ofer kar de

 bihar ke darbhanga se saansad kirti aaazaad ko bijepi ne party se suspend kar diya he
 The party's national president Amit Shah has accused Azad of carrying out anti-party activity
 aaazaad par aarope he ki unhone party line se alag jaakar gatividhi kii hai
 Punishment for speaking the truth: Kirti Azad, who appeared in front of the media after Azadanilamban said that i did not do any anti-party activity
 main 9 saal se is mudde ko uthaa rahaa hum
 If someone is responsible, then that party is themselves
 jo sach bolta he wo baahar hota he
 Now i tell you
 maine vyaktigat kisi ke khilaaf nahin bolaa
 It is unfortunate for the party that i was removed
 aaj tak se baatcheet main kirti aaazaad ne kaha ki unhone abhi duusari party main jane ko lekar koi faisla nahin kiya he, lekin party ko do took chetavanee jarur de daali
 He said - see what happens next
 jetali par bolaa tha hamaladasalakirti ajaadane vitt mantri arun jetali ke khilaaf morcha khol diya tha
 Azad held a press conference on Sunday without naming Jaitley and alleged that crores of crores were paid to fake companies in the DDCA
 aaazaad pichley kaaphi samay se didisie main kathith rup se hue bhrashtachar ko lekar kaaphi mukhar rahe hai
 Shah wrote Khatbijp national president Amit Shah wrote a letter to Kirti informing him about his suspension
 shah ne khat main likhaa ki pichley kuch maheenon se aapane party ke niyamon kaa ulanghan kiya he or party virdohi gatividhiyaan kii hai
 You made a knot with the opposition parties Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party to get the party in trouble
 sadan ke andar or baahar donon jagah aapane party ke virodh mengtividhiyaan kii
 Shah further writes in the letter that you made anti-party statements in the media
 aapke kaamon se party or padaadhikariyon kii pratishtha bhi daanv par lagi
 By repeatedly raising this issue, you tried to embarrass the party and its people

 Not only this, Sunny always takes care that she should never make such a statement, so that she is criticized in the media
 lekin jab spilitavila ke ek pratiyogi ne unhen ek box se maaraa to unhen khub gussa aayaa
 However, the contestant did not throw the box with the intention of hurting Sunny Leone
 balki uskaa nishaanaa to koi anya pratiyogi tha, lekin shikaar sani ho gayi or box unke pair par jaakar laga
 This put Sunny Leone in her feet
 iske baad sani leone ke gusse kaa koi thikaana nahin rahaa, wo dard ke maare karaah rahi thim or us pratiyogi par jor-jor se chillane or gaali-galouj karne lageen
 The contestant then apologized to Sunny, but it took him a long time to calm down
 baad main unhone apane pair main pade nil kii ek tasviir lekar twit kiya, jisamen unhone likhaa ki dekhen box kitni jor se mere pair main laga tha
 This is how hard that box hit me from the last episode of @ mtvsplitsvillai know he didn't mean it but it hurt: (pic

 madhyapradesh main is baar anaaj kii banpar paidaavaar hui he, lekin ek baar phir sarkari laaparvaahee se anaaj sad rahaa he
 About four hundred quintals of grains were damaged due to sudden rains in Chhindwara Mandi of Chhindwara
 yahi halaat bhind, siwani jaise kai ilaakon kii mandiyon main dikhe
 There are four teen sheds in Chaurai Mandi, besides the traders here, the cooperative society is also buying
 kisaanon kaa aarope he 4 main se 3 shed main adhikariyon kii mili bhagat se vyapaariyon kaa anaaj rakhaa he, kisaanon kii tulaai khule main hoti he jisase achaanak ai barish main anaaj barbaad ho gaya
 Farmer Naveen Sharma, who brought wheat to the mandi, said that the message has come from 8 days, the farmer is sitting, today the whole grain got wet in the rain
 lagbhag 50 quintal kaa nuksaan ho gaya
 In Bhind too, wheat was destroyed for buying Hazro Quintal kept in the rainy market on 11 May
 siwani mandi main bhi genhu par barish kaa grahan laga
 By the way, the government asked questions to save the crop from rain, but she started singing her virtues in the case
 jansampark mantri narottam mishra ne fasal bachaane ke sawaal par kaha ye sthaneey vyavastha he
 By the way the crop has come good, the hard work of the farmer and the record of irrigation due to the Chief Minister of the earth has increased the area
 vipaksh kaa aarope he fasal ko jaan boojhkar sadaaya ja rahaa he
 Youth Congress President Kunal Chaudhary said, if you can loot, loot it, the scheme is going on in the name of farmers
 jab kisaan ke paas fasal rahati he to daam nahin milte jab kisaan ke paas se fasal chali jaati he to itane daam badhate hai upabhokta bhi pareshaan he
 They are deliberately rotten, they have got the bhagat of the government so that the selected traders will benefit
 desh main is baar genhu kaa ricard utpaadan hua he labhagag 350 lakh ton kharidari sarkaar kar sakati he, lekin ek baar phir bhandaaran main bhayaavah laaparvaahee kii tasviren saamne aa rahi hai
 This year, Sakar has fixed the MSP of wheat at Rs 1735 per quintal
 rajya sarkaar 265 rupaye bonus de rahi he, yani kisaanon ko 2,000 rupee quintal milenge
 The Madhya Pradesh government aims to buy 67 lakh tonnes of wheat, but if it is ruined like this, both the customer and the farmer will have to be upset
 vaise sarkaar se sawaal fasal ko barish se bachaane kaa poocha lekin wo maamle main apane gun gane lagi
 Public Relations Minister Narottam Mishra said on the question of saving crops, this is the local system
 vaise fasal acchhee ai he, kisaan kii mehnat he or dharti putr mukhyamantri kii vajah se sinchai kaa jo record rakabaa badhaayaa he
 The opposition alleges that the crop is being purposely rotten
 youth congress adhyaksh kunal choudhary ne kaha lut sako to lut lo, yojana kisaanon ke naam par chal rahi he
 When the farmer remains with the crop, he does not get the price
 When the crop is gone from the farmer, the consumer increases the prices
 jaan boojhkar sada rahe hai, sarkaar kii mili bhagat he taaki chuninda kaarobaariyon ko phayda ho
 This time there has been a record production of wheat in the country, about 350 lakh tonnes can be procured by the government, but once again pictures of horrific negligence in storage are coming out
 is saal sakaar ne gehun kaa emspi 1735 rupaye prati quintal tay kiya he
 The state government is giving a bonus of Rs 265, that is, farmers will get Rs 2,000 quintals
 madhyapradesh sarkaar ne kaa lakshya 67 lakh ton gehun kharidne kaa he, lekin agar ye aise hi barbaad hua to graahak or kisaan donon ko pareshaan hona hoga
 The International Cricket Council (ICC) asked the captains of India and England cricket teams, Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Alastair Cook respectively, to exercise restraint and respect the icc's judicial process
 gauratlab he ki england main chal rahe test shrunkhlaa ke dauraan rabindra jadeja or james anderson vivaad maamle par aae isisi ke faisle kii dhoni or cook donon ne aalochana kii thi
 Dhoni criticized the decision to impose a penalty of 50 per cent match fee on Jadeja saying that "many things were ignored while taking the decision"
 " The two teams clashed between Jadeja and Anderson on the second day of the first Test match at Trent Bridge in Nottingham
 jiske baad bharat ne anderson par jadeja ko apshabd kehane or dhakka dene ke liye shrenee-3 kaa aarope lagaaya, jabaki england ne jadeja par shrenee-2 kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 ICC Chief Executive Dave Richardson said the statements made by Dhoni and Cook are questioning the disciplinary process of the ICC
 isisi dwaara jari vaktavy main richardsan ne kaha, "cook or haal hi main dhoni ne trent brij main hue pehle test match ke dauraan upje vivaad par haal hi main saarvajanik bayaan die
 Dhoni's statement is serious and undermines the icc's disciplinary process
 " The ICC also defended match referee David Boon's decision to impose a fine on Jadeja
 richardsan ne kaha, "isisi david boon dwaara liye gaye nirnay or iske liye apanaai gai prakriya kaa samarthan karata he
 Under the ICC Code of Conduct, deciding such disputes is very complex
 ham david boon dwaara maamle ke samast sabooton kaa saavdhaneepurvak adhyayan karne ke baad liye gaye nirnay se santusht hai
 " jadeja ko chunki isisi kii aachaar samhita ke shrenee-1 ke ulanghan kaa aaropee paaya gaya he, isliye vah isisi ke is faisle ke khilaaf apil nahin kar sakate
 But the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is currently consulting with its lawyers to appeal against it

 bihar ke purv up-mukhyamantri or maujuuda samay main netaa vipaksh tejasvi yadav (tejashwi Yadav) ne loksabhaa chunaav (lok sabha Election 2019)se thik pehle piem narendra modi (PM Modi) or bihar ke siem nitish kumaar (nitish Kumar) par tanj kiya he
 He (tejashwi Yadav) tweeted that Modi ji cheated Bihar on the pretext of two crore jobs from youth, Rs 15 lakh in bank accounts, special state status and special package
 you-turn specialist nitish chachaa to har teen saal main palatibaji kaa stant kar bihar ko thagte rahete hai
 Listen, Mr
 Modi, now
 
 
 'bardaasht nahin bihar se chal, chalo banaaen behatar kal
 In another tweet, Tejashwi Yadav wrote that how long will Nitish Chacha stay behind the chair? The election has come, now get out, talk on issues, the public is waiting
 modi ji ne yuvaaon se 2 karod rojgaar, 15 lakh khate main, vishesh rajya kaa darja or vishesh package ke bahaane bihar ko ji bharkar chalaa

 com / kv4avsgrot Significantly, this is not the first time that Tejashwi Yadav has targeted PM Modi and CM Nitish Kumar
 isse pehletejasvi yadav ne kaha tha ki nitish kumaar or narendra modi ji kaa gathbandhan ghor avasarvadita kii paraakaashtha he
 In the name of Narendra Modi, on which Nitish Kumar had split from BJP, what did he not say to Narendra Modi in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections? In the 2015 Bihar assembly elections, Narendra Modi and his tapes were heard to defeat the BJP, it was like blowing air
 15 lakh or 2 karod naukariyanmangte the
 But in 2017, Nitish Kumar insulted the mandate and joined hands with the BJP which defeated all the principles, dignity, policy and rules
 tejasvi yadav ne kaha tha ki abhi bhi nitish kumaar or narendra modi main avishvaas kaa rishta he
 If Nitish Kumar did not give the status of Patna University up to Central University, as Nitish Kumar said, then where can Nitish Kumar have the courage to ask Narendra Modi for special state status for Bihar? My Prime Minister Modi and Nitish Kumar have some questions
 
 
 pehla sawaal to yah ki kya nitish kumaar BJP ko abhi bhi 'bharat jalaao party' or 'badkaa juthi party' maanate he? agar maanate he to saath kyon he? agar nahin maanate to apane pehle vaale vaktavy ke liye maafi maange? kya narendra modi JDU ko abhi bhi 'janata kaa daman or utpeedan' maanate he? agar maanate he to janata ke daman or utpeedan main saath kyon he?, teesraa sawaal yah ki kya narendra modi bihar kii janata se vishesh rajya kaa darja nahin dene ke apane vaade se mukarne kii maafi maangenge? modi ji ne loksabhaa chunaav main anekon baar bihar ko vishesh rajya kaa darja dene kaa vaada or ghoshnaa kii thi? sawaal to yah bhi he ki kya modi ji 1 lakh 65 hazaar karod kaa drametic vishesh package kaa vistrut lekha-jokha bihar kii janata ko denge? sawaal to yah he ki kya rambilas paswan ko bagal main baitaakar nitish kumaar parivaarwaad par bhaashan denge? nitish kumaar ko chunauti detaa hoon ki agar wo parivaarwaad ke kilaaf he, to saarvajanik rup se ghoshnaa kare kii wo apane suputr ko raajnneeti main nahin laayenge or parivaravaadi dalon se gathbandhan nahin karenge
 Tejashwi Yadav had asked that Amrapali CMD Anil Sharma who contested from Nitish Kumar's party
 jo bijepi kii madad se rajyasabha chunaav lade
 Will Narendra Modi and Nitish Kumar end corruption by taking corrupt people like Mukul Roy, Yedurappa, Sukhram and Anil Sharma? Will Narendra Modi be counted with his word to report to the public the action taken against Nitish Kumar's 33 scams and 10 more big scams like creation after that? If Modi is honest against corruption, then why not speed up the CBI investigation against Nitish Kumar for creation and other scams? Modi only, this dualism will not work in Bihar? Will Nitish Kumar take this pledge by writing publicly from the stage at the Sankalp rally tomorrow and give an affidavit that he will not compromise with any other coalition except the BJP and retaliate till the 2024 general election
 agar wo aisa nahin karte he to spasht he ki wo aam chunaav ke baad kursi dekh kisi bhi dal ke saath bhaag sakate he
 Will BJP take an affidavit from them? Tejashwi had asked if PM Modi will make public the DNA report of Bihar CM Nitish Kumar in Patna tomorrow? Nitish ji sent a PMO after cutting a hair and nails of 1 crore Biharis, including himself, by filling a train
 ‬ kya modi ji bataayenge nitish ji ne unki thali kyon khinchi thi? baadh ke samay unki madad ko kyon nakaara tha? 2103 me unke naam par bijepi se gathbandhan kyon todaa tha? kya nitish kumaar or narendra modi bataayenge bihar ko vishesh rajya kaa darja kyon nahin diya ja rahaa? aise main sawaal yah bhi uthta he ki kya narendra modi har naagarik ko 15 lakh rupye er yuvaaon ko salanaa 2 karod naukari dene ke apane vaade par spashtikaran dena chahenge? kya nitish kumaar satta sangrakshit or samposhit mujaffarpur jan balaatkaar mahapaap ke liye janata se maafi maangenge? BJP campaigned aggressively: Congress campaign was good: During the era of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Election Chanakya National President of Indian politics Amit Shah, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) waved success flags in the elections
 in safaltaaon ke pichhimit shaahaki ranneeti rahi, to piem modi kaa cheharaa bhi
 Whether the election is from any state, the BJP may or may not have named the Chief Ministerial candidate in the presidential style, he has put forward the face of PM Modi
 maharashtra ke chunaav main bhi party ne centre main narendra, rajya main devendra kaa naaraa diya tha
 Similarly, in Haryana, a strategy of propaganda was woven around Modi and the Manohar government
 bhaajapa ke presidential style kaa yah bhartiya varjan ek baar phircongresspar baari padaa
 Except Haryana, the Congress leader got stuck in the attacks on the special and failed to make public the issue of issues, give it edge, localize the election
 nateeja haar ke rup main saamne aayaa
 In both states, the BJP tried to appear as a ruling party in the elections
 prachaar ke dauraan bhaajapa ne satta main rahete hue bhi khud ko vipaksh main khadaa dikhaane kii koshish kii
 In each rally, the leaders counted the achievements of Modi at the Center and the Manohar government of the state, more than that, the opposition attacked the Congress and the imperfections of the regime
 bhaajapa kii yah ranneeti anti inakambency ko ek had tak kam karne main safal rahi
 The Congress also suffered due to sluggishness in the campaign
 While the BJP campaigned aggressively on the one hand, on the other hand, the Congress also looked dull on this front
 haryana or maharashtra ke mukhyamantriyon ne rathyatra ke madhyam se prayek vidhansabha main pahunchane kaa prayaas kiya

 is dauraan unhone punjab ke afasaron ko saraahaa ki ve punjabi main bahut acha patrachaar karte hai, lekin iske saath hi unhone kaha diya, 'punjab ke zyaadaatar IAS thik se angreji main patrachaar nahin kar sakate
 'finance Minister Manpreet Badal's criticism was criticized as soon as the statement of Finance Minister Manpreet Badal surfaced in Punjab and the opposition parties akali-bjp and Aam Aadmi Party put Manpreet Badal, who was responsible for IAS officers, into the dock
 akali dal ke pradhan sukhbir badal ne kaha ki manpreet badal ko khud angreji nahin aati or wo urdu main hi baat karte hai
 In such a situation, they should not give advice to IAS officers
 'punjab ke IAS afasaron kaa majaak banaaya'vahiin akali dal ke punjab ke purv vitt mantri parminder singh dhindsa ne kaha ki wo bhi punjab ke vitt mantri rahe hai, lekin unako kabhi aisa anubhav nahin hua ki kisi IAS adhikari kii likhi sarkari chitthee dekhakar unhen sharmindagi kaa saamana karnaa padaa ho
 Parminder Singh Dhindsa said that by saying this as finance minister, Manpreet Badal has made fun of IAS officers of Punjab
 aam aadmi party kii pratikriyaam aadmi party ne bhi manpreet badal ko naseehat di he ki agar punjab main punjabi bhashaa kaa istemaal bad rahaa he, to ye acchhee baat he
 In such a situation, there is no need to pay more attention to English
 aam aadmi partike varisht netaa baljinder cor ne kaha ek ore to sarkaar punjabi bhashaa ko badhaava dene kii baat karti he
 At the same time, he publicly insults his officers for not doing correspondence in English properly
 baljinder cor ne kaha ki manpreet badal khud to urdu main baat karte hai or apane afasaron ko angreji thik se likhane kii naseehat de rahe hai
 Manpreet Badal seems to be surrounded badly after the statement made by the minister on the English to the IAS officers
 khabar ye bhi he ki manpreet badal ke is bayaan se punjab ke IAS afasar bhi behad naaraaz hai, lekin protocol kii vajah se wo khulkar kuch bhi kehane se batch rahe hai
 By the way, if we talk about the previous government, then all the English teachers also failed in the English test

 supreme court ne jainon ke dharmik rivaaj 'santhara' (mrityu tak upwas) ko avaidh bataane vaale rajasthan hoicourt ke aadesh par antarim roak laga di he
 The Rajasthan High Court termed the practice as suicidal and punishable under the Indian Penal Code 306 and 309
 digambar jain parishad ne hoicourt ke is faisle ko supreme court main chunauti di thi
 In fact, the Rajasthan High Court had said that santhara or fast till death is not an essential part of Jainism
 ise maanviya nahin kaha ja saktaa, kyonki yah mul maanavadhikaron kaa ulanghan karata he
 The comments vakil nikhil soni ne varsh 2006 main ‘santhara’ kii vaidhata ko chunauti dete hue hoicourt main janhit yachika daayar kii thi
 The petitioner's lawyer had described 'santhara', which is fasting till death after sacrificing food and water, as a violation of the right to life

 In the Jain scriptures this type of death is called Santhara
 ise jivan kii antim sadhana bhi mana jaataa he, jiske aadhaar par vyakti mrityu ko paas dekhakar sabakuch tyaag detaa he

 (from input language) kukhyat aatanki sanghathan alqaida ke chif rahe osama bin laden ke bete hamaja bin laden kii maut kii khabar he
 Hamza's death has been claimed in media reports quoting US intelligence officials
 hamaja, osama kii 3 jivit patniyon main se ek kheriya sabaar kaa betaa tha, jo abtabad main apane pati osama bin laden ke saath rah rahi thi
 In March this year, it was reported that the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) had taken a major decision and named Hamza bin Laden, the son of Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, in the banned list
 is bain ke baad hamaja bin laden kii yatra par pratibandh lag gaya tha
 All his assets were confiscated
 saath hi uski ore se kii jane vaali hathiyaaron kii kharid-farokht par roak laga di gai thi
 Hamza bin Laden was seen as the 'most likely successor' of Al Qaeda's current leader Ayman al Jawahiri
 sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad (UNSC) kii 1,267 iesas or alqaida pratibandh samiti ne farvari ke antim hafte main 29 varshiya hamaja ke naam ko suchi main daal diya tha
 On the same day, the US announced a reward of one million dollars (about 7 crore rupees) to the informer regarding Hamza
 sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad (UNSC) or america kii ore se hamaja bin laden ko lekar is kade faisle ke baad saudi arab ne bhi ghoshnaa kii thi ki usne hamaja kii naagarikta radd kar di he
 Then the press release issued by the Security Council stated that Al Zawahiri announced that Saudi Arabia-born Hamza bin Laden was an official member of Al Qaeda
 sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad ne tab duniya ko aagaah karte hue kaha ki hamaja ne 'alqaida ke sadasyon se aatankwaadi hamale karne kaa aahvaan kiya he
 He was seen as Al Jawahiri's most 'potential successor'
 'lambey samay se 'jihad ke crown prince' ke naam se kukhyat hamaja ke thikaanon ko dhundne kii koshish america kar rahaa tha
 It was then said that he could hide anywhere
 aise kayaas lagaae ja rahe the ki vah pakistan main chipa ho saktaa he, yaa phir afghanistan yaa iran main uske hone kii khabar aati rahi,pichley saal agast main aisi khabar bhi ai thi ki hamaja ne world trade centre (WTC) par aatanki hamale ke gunahagaar aparankarta mohammad atta kii beti se shaadi kar lee
 Hamza's marriage was confirmed to Osama bin Laden's half-brothers, Ahmed and Hasan Atta, from the English newspaper The Guardian
 jharkhand vidhansabha chunaav ke pehle charan kii 13 siton par kaaphi rochak muqabla hota najar aa rahaa he
 In the first phase, 190 candidates are contesting in 13 seats
 bijepi pratyaashee ko party ke baagi or endie se naata todakar alag maidan main utari ol jharkhand student union (ageesu) ne mushkilen khadi kar di hai
 In the first phase of the 13 assembly seats, the BJP is seen to be contesting on three of its rebel candidates
 jabaki, teen par endie se alag hokar chunaav lard rahe ol jharkhand student union (ageesu) se chunauti mil rahi he or saat siton par bijepi or mahagathbandhan ke bich sidhaa muqabla mana ja rahaa he
 Let us know that in the first phase, 9 seats belong to Palamu division
 yahaan gadwa, daltonganj, vishrampur, panaki, manika, gumla or bishunpur main bijepi or congress-jeemem gathbandhan ke bich sidhaa muqabla he
 The rebel candidates are challenging the BJP in Bhavnathpur, Latehar and Chatra
 lohardaga, chhatarpur or hussainabad seat par ageesu bijepi kaa sameekaran bigaadti najar aa rahi he
 The BJP made Bhanupratap Shahi, a candidate from the youth struggle front, cutting the ticket of Anant Pratap Dev from Bhavnathpur
 isse naaraaz hokar anant pratap nirdaleey taur par chunavi maidan main hai
 Similarly, BJP has fielded Prakash Ram from JVM in Latehar seat, due to which Baidyanath Ram revolted and took the field on behalf of JMM
 isi tarah se chatra seat par bijepi ne jai prakaash singh bhagat kaa tikat katkar argedy se aae janardan paswan ko utaara he
 In such a situation, Satyanand Bhokta, who was an MLA from this seat from BJP, has rejected the election rhythm from RJD
 iske alaava jharkhand main basapa kii iklauti seat rahi hussainabad se party ne is baar sher ali ko utaara he, jiske chalate vidhayak kushvaha shivapujan mehta ne ageesu se taal thok di he
 In the Mahagathbandhan formula, this seat has gone to rjd's account and the party has fielded Sanjay Yadav while the BJP has given its support to Independent candidate Vinod Kumar Singh
 lekin hussainabad seat ke raajnneetik sameekaran ko dekhte hue yah seat paramparaagat rup se basapa ke paas rahi he
 In such a situation, the atmosphere seems to be in his favor by joining Muslim votes
 pehle charan kii 13 siton par jeviem samet anya dalon ke ummidavaar bhi baaji badal sakate hai
 Of these, four seats are considered very high profile
 inamen vishrampur seat par ramchandra chandravanshi or chandrashekhar dube par sabaki najar rahegi
 In Garhwa seat, BJP is contesting between Satyendra Nath Tiwari and jmm's Mithilesh Thakur
 aise hi dalatonganj seat par bijepi alok chaurasia or congress ke krishnanand treepathi ke bich sidhi takkar dekhne ko mili rahi he
 In such a panki seat, there is going to be a close fight between bjp's Kushwaha candidate Shasibhushan Mehta and Congress's Devendra Kumar Singh
 latehar seat par bijepi ke prakaash ram or jeemem ke baidhnath ram to manika seat par bijepi ke raghupal singh or congress ke ramchandra singh ke bich seat ladaai maani ja rahi he
 In the same Gumla seat, bjp's Mishir Kujur and jmm's Bhushan Tirkey are in the fray
 bishunpur seat par bijepi ke ashok uraanv or jeemem ke chamara linda ke bich sidhi ladaai he

 View this post on Instagram🙏 The past few days have been trying times for us as a family
 Today, particularly, has been one of the hardest
 We laid to rest a beautiful soul who has gone too soon
 She leaves behind a legacy that is unique
 Her talent was undeniable, her beauty unmatched and her ability to connect with the audience was legendary
 Sri had the same connect with her family as well
 The one thing that helped us all get through these last few days, was the amazing amount of love and support from everyone - be it her many colleagues, to her innumerable fans, her caring friends and loving family, from across the country and the world 
 This outpouring of love is the memory that we would like Khushi and Janhvi to have of their mother
 
 
 a woman who was loved unquestionably by everyone
 Let us all who loved Sri, envelope her two little ones, her life, as she often called them, with as much or more love than we gave Sri so that they can live their lives ahead with a little less ache in their hearts
 Let us help them remember their mother fondly, with that beloved twinkle in her eyes, and help them build a life and be what Sri had dreamt for them
 To the members of the media, we ask that you respect the privacy of the family and allow us the space to grieve
 Sri lived her life with dignity and we implore, that you give her the same respect

 District Judge Amarnath did not accept Rawat's request to stay the order passed by the Center to vacate the house
 nyaayadhish ne unase unka tip saat bangala khaali karne ko kaha jahaan vah mukhyamantri banane se pehle rah rahe the
 He pleaded with the court because he was given an alternative home on Rouse Avenue
 unhone kaha ki yah ghar kharaab haalat main he or unke rahane ke liye sahi nahin he
 However, when the matter was put up for hearing, the Center said that since Rawat was not willing to relocate to Rouse Avenue, he was given another option on Purana Qila Marg under state quota which he did not oppose

 The Congress has been constantly questioning Anil Ambani's entry in the deal between India and the French government, and now a new revelation has revived the controversy
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi anil ambani korafel dilmen shaamil kiye jane par lagaataar centre sarkaar or pradhanmantrinarendra modise lagaataar sawaal poochhate rahe hai
 a French website quoted former French President François Hollande as saying that Anil Ambani's Reliance's name was proposed by the Indian government for the Rafale deal and Dassault Aviation Company had no other option
 oland kaa kahana he ki bharat sarkaar kii taraf se hi reliance kaa naam diya gaya tha
 Dasso does not have a role in choosing this
 kya kahata he media partoland kaa saakshaatkaar chhapane vaali media part ke adhyaksh adway planele ne india today se is maamle main kaha ki deal ko lekar oland bilkul spasht hai, unhone deal ke vakt anil ambani kii maujuudagi ko lekar bharat sarkaar se sawaal kiye the
 Reliance was forcibly imposed in this case by the Indian government
 pehle qaraar 100 se zyada vimaan ko lekar tha, lekin baad main bharat sarkaar ne 36 vimaanon par sahmati jataai
 The head of the media part said that we had asked him a question about Anil Ambani because later Ambani's money was invested in Julie Zeit's film
 is par oland ne kaha ki is deal kaa matlab yah nahin ki vah apni garlfriend ko kuch gift karen
 Ambani did not meet the French government for the deal
 reliance bharat sarkaar kii maang ke aadhaar par deal main shaamil tha
 Hollande said that the matter is not related to his being the President
 koi sikret he modi kya?saamaajik kaaryakarta or prakhyat vakil prashanth bhushan ambani ke ek twit ne puure maamle main nayaa mode laa diya
 In his tweet, he quoted former French President François Hollande as saying that France had no role in choosing Anil Ambani

 Is this also a secret, Modi ji? 'this is explosive! Former French President Hollande, with whom Modi signed the new deal for 36 Rafale planes, says that the French & Dassault had no say in selecting Ambani as the partner (commission agent?) For the deal! Was recommended by Modi
 Is this also secret Modiji?https: / / t

 uski ore se kaha gaya he ki vyavsaayik maamle main bharat sarkaar kii koi bhoomika nahin he
 Neither the Government of India nor the French Government has any role in choosing a partner
 The report referring to fmr French president Mr
 Hollande's statement that GOI insisted upon a particular firm as offset partner for the Dassault Aviation in Rafale is being verified
 It is reiterated that neither goi nor French Govt had any say in the commercial decision
 - Defense Spokesperson (@spokespersonmod) September 21, 2018 The whole controversy came after an article published on Friday in the French news website mediapart

 PM cheated - Rahul Congress president Rahul Gandhi also attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi after this disclosure, tweeted, 'PM talked privately behind closed doors and made changes in it
 francwa oland ko dhanyavad, ham ab jaanate hai ki unhone diwalia ho chuke anil ambani ke liye billian dollars kii deal karai
 The Prime Minister has betrayed the country
 unhone hamaare sainikon kii shahadat kaa apmaan kiya he
 'the PM personally negotiated & changed the # Rafaledeal behind closed doors
 Thanks to François Hollande, we now know he personally delivered a deal worth billions of dollars to a bankrupt Anil Ambani
 The PM has betrayed India
 He has dishonoured the blood of our soldiers
 - Rahul Gandhi (@rahulgandhi) September 21, 2018 On the other hand, Congress leader Manish Tiwari retweeted the article, urging Hollande to give the price of the deal, saying, 'you also tell that Rafale's Rs 590 crore in 2012 How did the price become 1690 crores in 2015
 kareeb-kareeb 1100 karod kii vruddhi
 i know that because of the euro it is not a problem of calculus
 'president ( Former) Francois Hollande should also enlighten us how the price went up from 590 crores in 2012 to 1690 crores in 2015 per Rafale fighter jet? Escalation of a mere 1100 crores

 Due to the terrible earthquake in Nepal on Saturday, where both Nepal and India are in bad condition, modern internet services are working to reunite the affected families with their loved ones
 soshal netwarking site fasebuk kii 'sefti check' or google kii ‘person finder’ bhi sevaayen logon ko apano kii sthiti or khud ke surakshit hone sambandhi soochnaaon ko saajha karne main madad kar rahi hai
 For example, people of the Himmatramka family living in the Birganj area of nepal have marked themselves safe on Facebook
 parivaar ke sadsy nitesh himmatramka ne bataaya, 'bharat main hamaare rishtedaar hamaari suraksha ko lekar chintit thea, isliye hamane swayan ko surakshit chihnit kiya
 ' uttar pradesh se lekar pashchim bengal tak ke logon ne fasebuk kii is ‘sefti check’ suvidha kaa prayog kar khud ke surakshit hone ke bare main suchanaaen saajha kii hai
 The service was launched in October last year
 yah seva aapadaa prabhavit ilaakon main fanse hue logon ke liye alert jari karti he, jisamen log apane fasebuk mitron ko apane surakshit hone kii suchanaaen saajha karte hai
 Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg said in one of his posts, 'safety check' is our effort to help the community in times of natural disasters
 iske madhyam se koi aasaani se apane sabhi parijanon or doston ko bataa saktaa he ki vah prabhavit kshetra main surakshit he’
 The idea to build it came after the 2011 tsunami in Japan
 isi tarah google kaa ‘person finder’ prabhavit ilaakon main logon ko apane surakshit hone kii jaankaree dene main madad karata he
 Here you can find information about your loved ones from Google's database or share information about someone so that more people can find it
 is par do vikalp milte hai, pehla ‘ai em looking for samavan’ (main kisi ko dhund rahaa / rahi hum) or doosraa ‘ai haev infremeshan about samavan’ (mere paas kisi kii jaankaree he)
 This feature of Google is available on the homepage of Nepal and India only
 yah suvidha angreji, hindi or nepali bhashaa main uplabdh he
 Under this facility, information can also be collected from SMS in India and America to find someone
 vartmaan main isse ab tak 3300 logon kii jaankaree jutai ja chuki hai
 The service issues an alert for people stranded in disaster-hit areas, in which people share notifications about their safety to their Facebook friends
 fasebuk ke sansthaapak mark jukerbarg ne apane ek post main kaha tha, ‘prakritik aapadaa ke samay samudaay kii madad karne ke liye ‘sefti check’ hamaara ek prayaas he
 Through this one can easily tell all his family and friends that he is safe in the affected area '
 ise banane kaa vichaar varsh 2011 main japan main ai tsunami ke baad aayaa tha
 Similarly, Google's 'person Finder' helps people in affected areas to be informed about their safety
 yahaan par aap google ke databes main se apano kii jaankaree ko dhund sakate hai yaa kisi ke bare main jaankaree ko saajha kar sakate hai taaki or log use dhund saken
 There are two options on this, 'I am looking for someone' (I am looking for someone) and second 'I have information about someone' (I have information)
 google kii yah suvidha nepal or bharat ke hompej par hi uplabdh he
 This facility is available in English, Hindi and Nepali language
 is suvidha ke tahat kisi ko khojane ke liye bharat or america main esemes se bhi jaankaree jutai ja sakati he
 At present, information of 3300 people has been collected from it

 supreme court ne sahyog maanga ki jajon kii niyukti kii tarah kya samvedansheel keson ke aavanton ke maamle main sijeai kaa matlab collegium hona chahie
 The matter will be next heard on 27 April
 supreme court ne kaha ki isamen koi vivaad nahin ki CJI master of roster hai
 Prima facie, we feel that this can be resolved by rectifying the in-house process, not judicially
 supreme court ko ye tay karnaa he ki keson kaa aavaton kaise ho, koun kare
 Hundreds of cases are filed in the Supreme Court every day, in this case how will the judicial work be done if the five judges of the collegium decide it
 ye tarika vyavhaarik nahin lagata he
 The job of the judges is not just to give justice but to protect democracy and the Constitution and to maintain the rule of law
 supreme court ne chaar jajon kii press conference par kuch bhi sunne yaa bolne se inkaar kiya, kaha is par koi baat nahin karenge
 The court said that which case is sensitive or who will decide it
 kisi ke liye koi samvedansheel ho saktaa he kisi ke liye koi or
 At the same time, Dushyant Dave and Kapil Sibal said that the Chief Justice is the Master of Roster
 tippaniyan Petitions usually go directly to the judges by registry
 sirf samvedansheel maamalon ko hi registry chif justise ke paas bench ke liye puuchhati he

 June 3, 2010, Tilaknagar in Mumbai at 10 pm
 haal ke dinon main mumbai ne aisa shootout pehali baar dekha
 Don's henchmen worked all over his house
 koi kuch samaj paata, thodi hi der main goliyaan khamosh ho gayi
 The speed at which the shooters came, also disappeared at the same speed, but, the news that came out after this was also sensational with this incident
 ji haa, ye goliyaan chali thim chota rajan ke behad kareebi farid tanasha par
 The four attackers had done away with Chhota Rajan's henchman Farid Tanasha by firing bullets in his head, stomach and hands
 farid tanasha ke maare jane kii khabar jaise hi baahar ai, mumbai main sansani fail gai
 a lot of questions started coming up, but before the speculation market heated up, Bharat Nepali, the master mind of the shootout, came to the fore
 chota rajan kaa purana saathi
 Yes, this old colleague of Chhota Rajan had done all the work of Farid Tanasha
 mayanagari mumbai main bharat nepali ke haathon anjaam di gai ye duusari sabase badi vaardaat thi
 Earlier, the Nepalese people had murdered lawyer Shahid Azmi in his office on 11 February
 lekin, tanasha kii hatya mumbai anderworld ke liye koi maamuli ghatana nahin he
 Especially for Nana Company leader Chhota Rajan, because after the murder of Tanasha, there is now a danger that the Nana gang may not get upset
 17 sitambar 2000, bainkak sthit savan court apartment kii si wing kii imaarat goliyon se tharra uthati hai
 Around four attackers create a storm on the second floor of the c wing
 ye hamalaa hua tha anderworld don chota rajan par
 Dawood's henchmen Chota Shakeel's shooters carried out the attack
 kaayade se dekha jaae to chota rajan gang kii ulti ginati isi hamale se shuru ho gai thi
 Rajan had escaped in the attack, but his closest Rohit Verma was killed
 iske baad to chota rajan gang main aisi send lagi ki ab iske khatm hone kii athkalen bhi lagane lagi hai
 In 2005, Chhota Rajan's closest aide Balu Dokre was killed in Malaysia by d Company men
 baaluu dokare or rohit verma chota rajan ke sabase khatarnaak sharp shooter maane jate the lekin, dushman gang ne to rajan gang main send lagaai hi, khud apane shakki mizaaj or paise kii kamajori kii vajah se bhi rajan kamjor ho gaya
 For money, he sometimes took someone out of the company and sometimes offered bullets to his people
 rajan se alag ho chuke logon kii maane to 1993 ke mumbai blast ke baad usne di company se khud ko alag kar apane upar deshbhakti kaa mulammaa chadhaane kii koshish kii thi lekin, isaki aad main usne jo harakatein kii usne apano ko hi dushman bana liya
 If Rajan's old colleagues are to be believed, then Rajan adopted double standards regarding the accused of Mumbai blast
 jinase use phayda ho saktaa tha use apane drugs taskari ke dhandhe main istemaal kiya, jisase phayda nahin tha use maut ke ghat utaar diya
 For example, he used Pilu Khan and Ijaz Pathan, accused in the blast, to get into the drugs trade
 khabar he ki rajan ke tamaam puraane kareebi ab uske khilaaf ekajute ho gaye hai
 Ijaz Lakdawala, Hemant Pujari, Bunty Pandey have joined hands with a trio of Bharat Nepali, Santosh Shetty and Vijay Shetty against Rajan
 isamen sabase khatarnaak he bharat nepali, jo karnaa he to karnaa he, main yakeen rakhata he or is samay uskaa sabase bada makasad jaan padataa he naanaa gang kaa safaya
 Chhota Rajan's gang on the verge of extinction
 rajan kaa khaatmaa to das saal pehle hi ho gaya hota jab daaud ke ishaare par chota shakeel ke gurgon ne us par hamalaa bolaa tha
 Lucky little Rajan not only survived the wounds of the bullets but also escaped from Bangkok's hospital in a very surprising way from getting caught in the law
 em-16 se las thai military ke commandos ko bhanak bhi nahin lagi or faraar ho gaya don
 In a similar filmy style, underworld don Chhota Rajan escaped from the fourth floor of Samitiways Hospital in Bangkok
 di company ke hamale se to chota rajan kisi tarah baraa niklaa tha lekin apane aasapaas thai military ke commandos ko tainaat karwaakar chota rajan ne apane liye mol lee thi ek nai musiibat
 Here, Indian agencies were ambush for Rajan's extradition, on the other hand Chhota Rajan was flirting to be free from all these restrictions
 maheene bhar main rajan kii tabiyat thik ho chuki thi or use bainkak police aspataal main bhartee karaane kii baat shuru ho chuki thi
 Since Rajan's escape from there would have been impossible, Rajan's henchmen speeded up the drive to expel him
 pehle aspataal ke doctor chingam kii madad se rajan ko usee aspataal main bhartee rakhane kaa aadesh adaalat se jari karavaaya gaya or phir bhaagane kii sansanikhej ranneeti banane lagi
 The most important characters in it were Santosh Shetty and Bharat Nepali
 usee santosh shetty se jab aaj tak kii team ne bainkak main mulaakaat kii to usne bataaya ki us 15 din main hamane planning shuru kiya
 Now how to get rid of them
 is dauraan hamane ye kiya ki bharat bhai ne jo mountain cliembing kaa ek course sikh liya
 Seven Day Crash Course
 ji haa, chauthi manzil se bhaagane ke liye rassi ke sahare kudane kii training bharat nepali ne lee
 At around eleven o'clock on the night of 24 November 2000, Thai commandos were knocked unconscious by having a sleeping pill in the drinks
 raat ke kareeb ek baje bharat nepali mountain cliembing ke upkaran se las rajan ke kamare main pahunchaa
 As Rajan's wounds were not yet healed, he tied Rajan in his waist
 15 minute kii mashkkat ke baad donon neeche pahunch chuke the jahaan santosh thai military kii gaadi lekar taiyaar tha
 The trio reached the Cambodia border from there where they fled to Cambodia with the help of a helicopter
 phir indonesia, tehran or landan hote hue wo kareeb do saal malaysia laut aayaa
 However, security agencies were not the first to be exposed by Rajan
 2003 main wo singapore main bhi fansaa tha
 It happened that Rajan was going to London on the passport of a British citizen named Joginder Singh
 amsterdam main jab uskaa huliya passport kii tasviir se mail nahin khaaya to emigration adhikariyon ne usase big ben ke bare main poocha lekin, rajan ke paas iskaa jawaab nahin tha
 After investigation, it was found that Joginder Singh had died years before
 rajan ko agali hi flit se singapore bhej diya gaya jahaan wo chaar dinon tak emigration ke ditension centre main kaid rahaa
 Santosh Shetty and Bharat Nepali helped him once again with this difficulty
 use kisi tarah jamaanat dilwakar samudr ke raste se singapore se nikaal le gaye
 Mumbai blasts of 1993, these blasts had written a very dark and hideous chapter of terrorism
 inhen dhamaakon ke baad di company main padi thi ek badi daraar
 After the Mumbai blast, Chhota Rajan was separated as Dawood's traitor
 usne daaud ke kuch logon ko chun-chun kar maar giraaya
 It was felt that Rajan has waged a war against the enemies of the country but now only those who are with Rajan are questioning his intentions
 isamen sabase aage he santosh shetty
 According to Santosh Shetty, it happened that in 92, Chhota Rajan started separating from Dawood and started to marginalize
 or usee vakt plan bananaa shuru ho chukaa tha ki main kaise inase alag ho jaaun or dur chalaa jaaun
 It had no relation or connection with the Bombay bomb blast
 blast to ek bahaanaa ban gaya tha
 There are more reasons to question Rajan's intentions
 misaal ke taur par 1993 bam dhamaake ke aaropee film distributor hanif kadawala kii hatya
 It is reported that a few months before the murder, Rajan collected Rs 2 crore from Hanif
 sawaal uthta he ki agar rajan kii najar main kadawala deshadrohi tha to phir use paise vasuulne kii kya zarurat thi
 Rajan's intentions are being questioned by another close friend
 wo he guru satum
 According to Satam, after reaching Malaysia, Rajan told Dawood on the phone that the path of the two had been separated and he needed his share
 daaud ne rajan ko niraash nahin kiya or fouran 10 lakh dirham rajan ke hawaale kar diya
 Not only this, after Sharad Shetty was killed in his Dubai hotel in 2003, Rajan called Dawood and said that Sharad was gone, the account was paid

 BCCI President n Srinivasan made it clear that he would not resign
 shrinivasana ne kaha ki un par dabaav daalaa ja rahaa he lekin istife kaa sawaal nahin hota he
 Meanwhile, Gurunath Meiyappan was produced today in the Fort Court of Mumbai, where the court ordered to send Meiyappan to the police custody by 29 May
 police ne mayppan kii saat din kii hiraasat maangi thi
 On reaching Mumbai, Srinivasan told reporters, 'I have done nothing wrong, i have no intention of resigning
 koi mujhe istipha dene ke liye baadhya nahin kar saktaa he
 Some people are now trying to create pressure but the question does not arise
 ’unhone hawaii adde par patrakaron se sankshipt baatcheet main kaha ki bisisiai puri tarah se apane niyamon ke hisaab se chalegaa
 The law will do its job
 is bich pitiai ke hawaale se khabar aa rahi he ki yadi shrinivasana istipha nahin dete hai to unhen nilambit kiya ja saktaa he
 Meiyappan confessed to the crime In the interrogation of the police, Meiyappan confessed to the crime of betting
 mayppan ne kaha ki ve vindu daara singh ke jariye satta lagaate the
 Meiyappan will be presented in court on Saturday
 mumbai krime branch ke joint seepi himanshu roy kii aguwai main hui kareeb 3 ghante kii poochtacha ke baad mayppan ko giraftaar kiya gaya
 Himanshu Rai said, 'there is evidence of Meiyappan's involvement in betting
 mayppan ko 24 ghante ke andar court main pesh kiya gaya jayega
 'mumbai Crime Branch asked about 60 to 70 questions to Meiyappan
 mayppan ke shuukravaar shaam yahaan pahunchate hi mumbai police ne unke khilaaf ipel main spot phixing maamle kii jaanch main teji ke liye unhen turant police mukhyalay le gai
 Police interrogated Meiyappan in the case after Meiyappan's name was revealed by Bollywood actor Vindu Dara Singh, arrested in the spot-fixing case in IPL-6
 vindu ne kidaham khulaasevahin spot phixing ke aarope main giraftaar vindu daara singh ko adaalat ne 28 may tak police castady main bhej diya he
 Meanwhile, BCCI Chief n Srinivasan may be discharged from his post
 sutron ke hawaale se khabar he ki ise lekar bisisiai ke bheetar aam sahmati ban gai he
 If Srinivasan withdraws, he will be replaced by Arun Jaitley
 krime branch ko sattebaaji ke aaropon main giraftaar vindu se abtak jo jaankaree mili he uske hisaab gurunath sattebaaji ke sabase bade guru najar aate dikh rahe hai
 If we believe Vindu's disclosures, Gurunath has lost about 1 crore in betting in the current season of IPL
 gurunath mobile ke jariye vindu daara singh ke sampark main rahete the or vindu daara singh or pawan jaipur naam ke buki se sampark sadhate the
 130 conversations held between Vindoo and Meiyappan The call records of the investigating agency revealed that in the last two months, Vindu and Gurunath had at least 130 conversations, not 25-30
 gurunath ke bare main kaaphi jaankaree mumbai police ne juta lee he
 But the real pole of Gurunath, who is seen as the great guru of betting, will be revealed when he will be confronted by Vindu, which has been prepared by the Mumbai Police
 mumbai police ke afasaron kii ek toli gurunath or vindu se sawaalon kii lambii suchi taiyaar kar rahi he
 In fixing, Pakistan umpire Bhigurunath is not only betting on the cricket ground as well as the umpire of Asad Rauf and the Mumbai Police is restless to crack down on him
 lekin khabaren hai ki gurunath kii tarah ampire asad rauf bhi mumbai police ko chamakaa dene main kaamyaab rahe
 Two days ago, the Mumbai Police got information about the exploits of Asad Rauf
 mumbai police kii krime branch ne do din pehle hi unki khojbin bhi shuru kar di lekin hoshiyaar asad rauf shaayad bharat se bhaag nikalne main kaamyaab rahe
 When the Mumbai Police run on Assad Rauf, it will run, but the ICC has fallen
 6 june se england main shuru ho rahi isisi champion trophy kii ampiring se rauf ko hataaya ja chukaa he
 The spotlight on cricket is fixing cricket, which is a game of courage and enthusiasm and competition, but the stigmas of cricket did not leave it worth anything
 cricketron ne isaki gend gend bech daali, ampire ne har gend ke saath stadium main gunjane vaali hindustaniyon kii bhavanaaen bench daali to baaki kaa hisaab team ke maalik or board ne kar diya
 What is left of fixing-betting in IPL now? nothing
 ipel kii ranginiyon or chamak ke peeche sab kaala he
 There is a huge fraud behind this shower of sixes and fours
 ipel ke kadam-kadam par sajeesh kaa gadabadjhaalaa he
 There is a huge scam of fixing behind this passion of India
 har roj hote nae khulaason se ipel kii chamak bad se badtar hoti ja rahi he
 It will not be the heart of cricket lovers who spend thousands of rupees to reach the stadium, but this is true
 is khel main badanaamiyon ke sivaa kuch bhi nahin
 In this game, there is nothing but messing with the feelings of Indians in this game
 ipel sijan-6 kii shandaar chamak ko pehla daag srisanth, ajit chandila, ankit chavaan se laga
 But after that, the stains started, after several days of fixing the IPL, so many stains of revelations have been made that the entire gamut of the IPL has turned black
 cricket khilaadiyon se ipel main phixing or sattebaaji kaa kalank bollywood tak pahunchaa
 The stigma of stigma from Bollywood reached the underworld and now the questions from the umpire to the CEO of the team are under question
 en shrinivasana bisisiai adhyaksh hai, desh main cricket ke kunbe main inke ishaaron ke bagaiyr ek patta nahin hill saktaa lekin inke damaad gurunath mayppan par hi sattebaaji ke sawaalon kaa shikanja he
 Gurunath Meiyappan, who is also the CEO of ipl's Chennai team, is being told that not only has he been fond of betting but he has also lost about 1 crore in IPL season-6
 bookies or khilaadiyon ko ladkiyaan supplai karata tha vindutaja khulaasa sunakar to aap hairaan hi rah jaaenge
 Inquiries from two models have revealed that TV artist Vindu Dara Singh, arrested for betting, used to supply bookies and girls to players as well
 to sawaal he cricket ke is kalank main bachaa kya or bachaa koun? khilaadi phixd hai to team ke siio phixd hai, ampire phicsad hai to gend-gend phixd he
 Would it not be correct to say that Vindu's relationship with All Is Fixed! Harbhajan and csk's 3 cricketers in IPL are making the cricket of passion and passion get further down in the IPL fixing and betting
 mumbai police ke hathe chadh chuke vindu daara singh ne kuch or naamon kaa khulaasa kiya he
 Vindu Dara Singh has confessed to good acquaintance with Harbhajan Singh (bhajji) and the 3 Chennai Super Kings cricketers
 ab jaanch agenciyaan ye pataa lagane main juty he ki vindu kii jaan pahchaan kii had kya he? mumbai police kii krime branch kaa haalanki khud hi ye kahana he ki vindu se jaan-pahchaan kaa matlab ye nahin ki in chaaron khilaadiyon ke bhi rishte sattebaaji yaa phixing se hon
 But you will also have to consider the next argument of the Mumbai Police
 mumbai police ne ye kaha he, 'inaki bhoomika kii jaanch kii jaaegi
 'the name of 4 cricketers including Harbhajan sprung up The scope of investigation of spot fixing in IPL is increasing
 sutron ke mutabik, kuch or khilaadi phixing ke is fande main jald funs sakate hai
 According to sources, Vindu has close ties with the three players of Chennai Super Kings
 yahi nahin, ve harbhajan singh ke bhi saath dekhe gaye hai
 But no evidence has yet been found of these players being involved in the fixing game
 modells ne kiye chaunkaane vaale khulaasedo modells se poochtacha main bhi chaukaaney vaale khulaase hue hai
 The models have confirmed to the Crime Branch of the Mumbai Police in interrogation that Pakistani umpire Asad Rauf was in contact with Vindu Dara Singh and some bookies arrested for betting
 modells ke hawaale se ye bhi khulaasa hua he ki rauf ko bhi ladkiyaan supplai kii jaati thim
 But the biggest disclosure of the questioning of the models is that TV artist Vindu Dara Singh himself used to supply girls to bookies and cricketers
 phixing cond main ab tak kya-kya hua
 
 
 The arrest of the first cricketers Sreesanth, Chandila and Chavan
 phir bisisiai adhyaksh en shrinivasana ke damaad or chennai super kigs ke siio gurunath mayppan sawaalon ke ghere main
 And now accuses Pakistani umpire Asad Rauf of directing the betting leaders on every finger in the cricket field at his fingertips
 aakhir cricket ke kalank se bachaa koun? noton kii moti-moti gaddiyon ke laalach main cricketer phixd to sattebaaji se noton kaa ambara khadaa karne kii jugat main ampire bhi phicsad or to or jinke bharose hindustan ne cricket kaa puraa rajpaat choda- us bisisiai adhyaksh ke damaad or chennai team ke siio gurunath mayppan ke bhi pair cricket ko kalankit karne vaale sattebaaji ke daldal main andar tak dhanse hue hai
 Just in this whirlwind of revelations related to fixing and betting, try to understand so much about which people are able to avoid the stains of the contact

 In 2014, the BJP captured all but one of these seats, except Azamgarh

 If the SP and BSP candidates look at the votes received in 2014 and if the traditional voters of both parties do not leave them, then the BJP is probably in a position to lose all 14 seats except Pratapgarh

 Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas are one of the popular couples
 kaaphi samay tak ek duusare ko date karne ke baad donon ne pichley saal disambar main shaadi kar lee thi
 Recently, Priyanka told about the moment when she fell in love with Nick
 ek intervyuu ke dauraan priyanka chopra ne kaha, ''nik jaise insaan se shaadi karne ke bare main sabase acchhee baat yah he ki ve samajhate hai ki hamaara jo kariyar he vah kya he uskaa mahatv kya he
 His career has been longer than my career
 unhen is kshetra main 20-21 saal ho gaye hai
 They know how much he and his family have sacrificed for their careers
 yahi ek cheez thi jise jaanakar laga ki mujhe unase pyaar ho gaya he
 "" i remember we had our second or third date
 main los angelis main meeting kar rahi thi
 During this time my team from India and America were present
 ham doston ke saath ek boat par lunch kar rahe the
 It was a memorable weekend and bunches with friends for me
 is dauraan agar mujhe koi meeting cancil karne kaa kaaran detaa to main cancil kar detii
 During this time i was wondering if they were listening to me, they were listening to me
 ''view this post on Instagram🧡 # cannes2019a post shared bypriyanka Chopra Jonas(@priyankachopra) onmay 19, 2019 at 7:47am pdtisake baad priyanka ne kaha, iske baad nik mujhe kinare le gaye or kaha, main samajhataa hum ki aap jahaan par hai uske liye aapane kitni mehnat kii hai
 I'm going to dinner with my friends, you finish work and come back
 main waapas jaakar meeting main baith gai
 i said, they are hosting our friends and waiting for me to end this meeting
 us dauraan mujhe pataa chalaa ki ve kitna khyaal rakhte hai'' For almost 18 years, Anil Kumble has been an important part of the public life of the country with his outstanding bowling and discipline, ie the period during which an infant becomes a full adult, capable of marrying, voting or driving
 ve desh kii phiraki gendbaaji kii parampara ke sabase kaamyaab kirdaar rahe hai or bhartiya cricket ke ab tak sabase kaamyaab match jitau gendbaaj bhi rahe hai
 Not only this, he is the second player in the history of cricket to score all 10 wickets in a Test innings
 unke is puure safar main aise maukey thode hi aae jab unki aalochana hui, ekaadh baar yah kaha gaya ki ''ve gend puri nahin ghuma paa rahe hai" or unhen vah aitihaasik naayakatv bhi hasil nahin hua jo amuman bhartiya darshakon ne shaayad ballebaajon ke liye surakshit kar rakhaa he
 But despite all this high-pitched, hope-and-disappointment, Kumble was really nervous for the first time on 21 June when he had to appear in an interview for his first appointment in Kolkata
 rashtriya team ke mukchay coach ke liye apane aavedan par bhartiya cricket control board (bisisiai) kii ucchstareey cricket paraamarsh samiti (siesi) ke saamne peshi ke bare main india today se khaas baatcheet main 45 varshiya kumble kehete hai, ''vah din vaaki baari tha! main un teen logon ke saamne baitha tha jinke saath dressing room main kai saal gujarey the, lekin ateet main cricket par naram-garam bahason se yah mulaakaat kuch alag kism kii hi thi
 The atmosphere was tense
 "kumble kaa intervyuu kar rahe teenon shaks sachin tendulkar, saurabh ganguli or ve
 V
 es
 Laxman has been his long-time collaborator on the field
 or kumble chaahe jitna tanaav mahasoos kar rahe hon par baaki kaa khyaal yah tha ki unhone usee sahajata or baariki se sari chijen bataayin jinase log parichit rahe hai
 Entering the room, she won the committee's heart by saying "good after nun, fox" in an unfamiliar style
 uske baad to kumble hi chhaae rahe
 According to a source familiar with the room's conversation, "he raised issues and the cac's man just shook his head
" unhone viraat kohli ke aakraamak tevar or use sahi disha dene kii baat kii
 He was unhappy with the attitude of the spin bowlers and insisted on taking 20 wickets abroad
 samiti ko kahana padaa ki kumble ne apana homework acha kiya he
 He did not want to get this appointment only with the help of his credibility as a player
 "unase do ahm sawaal puche gaeh unhen bataur coach kyon chunaa jaae, or ve bharat ke videsh main kharaab pradarshan ko sudhaarney main kaise madad kar sakate hai? kareeb 90 minute tak chaay kii chuskiyon ke saath kumble team india par apni raay rakhte rahe
 Apart from four Tests in the West Indies this July, India is going to play every Test match at home ground for the next 12 months, but Kumble is not ready to be tied for short-term gains
 unhone ganguli, lakshmana or tendulkar se kaha ki hamen gharelu maidan main to jarur jeetna chahie lekin hamen apane hunar ko har sthiti ke liye dhardaar bananaa hoga, ham ghumaavdaar pich banaakar gharelu maidan par apane phiraki gendbaajon ko test match teen din main nibata dene kaa mauka dene or videsh main tej pichon par bemaani hone kaa tarika nahin apana sakate
 "they were saying what the committee wanted to hear from them," says another source familiar with the conversation
 " aakhir ''jambo" (lambey pairon kii vajah se unhen pyaar se isi naam se bulaayaa jaataa he) ko 23 june ko bhartiya cricket ke sabase ahm or baari tanaav vaale pad kii jimmedaari hasil ho gai
 "he assured those people that he had the right thoughts about the team in his mind
" "kumble ne kuch hafte pehle apane parivaar ke saath chhuttiyaan bitaane ke dauraan coach kii hode main shaamil hone kaa man banaaya tha
 He says, "we were talking about what i want to do in the future
" baat gum-phirakar coach ke pad par aa tiki, kyonki mujhe pataa tha ki bhartiya team kisi coach kii talash main he
 "he told his wife Chetna that if he gets the responsibility of the coach, he will have to stay out of the house for months, as it used to be during the game
 ve kehete hai, ''usne kaha ki uskaa samarthan bana rahegaa, jaisaa ki vah hameshaa karti rahi he or bacchon kii umr bhi aisi ho gai he ki koi samasya nahin hogi
 Thinking just that, we sent our application
 "bisisiai kaa chakra teji se ghumaa
 Kumble's main competitor was another former Test captain, Ravi Shastri, who has been operating the team for the past 18 months in various capacities and has also become a rapport with Kohli
 haalanki kumble ke khilaaf pehali daleel yah thi ki unke paas kisi test team kii koching kaa anubhav nahin he, jo is pad kii ek anivaary shart thi, jise unke jaise khilaadi ko jarur pataa hona chahie tha
 Sources say, "as soon as he entered his room, the pan started bending rapidly
 " hode main haar jane se niraash ravi shastri ne sanket diya ki unki prastuti ke dauraan ganguli kii gaiyr-maujuudagi se andaja lag gaya ki unhen nishpaksh sunwaayee kaa mauka nahin milegaa
 Nevertheless he played the dignity of congratulating Kumble
 kathith taur par unhen ballebaaji coach banane kii peshkash kii gai thi lekin unhone thukraa diya
 The reason for Kumble's arrival in this new role in the golden generation is also the fact that a new era has come in Indian cricket, with the "golden generation" retiring from 2008 to 2013 now in various capacities
 Is added
 tendulkar or lakshmana siesi main ganguli ke saath hai, jo bengal cricket association ke bhi pramukh hai
 Rahul Dravid is the coach of India's a team
 anil kumble rashtriya team ke pramukh coach hai
 This is the kind of confluence in Indian cricket that everyone aspires to, even if it is happening in the corridors of power, not on the field, which has always been accused of neglecting the needs of players and spectators
 Which are like the lifeline of the game
 in paanchon main kumble hameshaa surkhiyon se dur rahe hai
 Looking at the players 'masculinity and superstars' image, they seem to be using them like a physicist on the field after learning all the twisted possibilities of cross-sloping lines in engineering school
 ve apane prayog main itane eemaandaar the ki koi un par sawaal nahin uthaa saktaa
 He emerged as a statesman who never tried to project his image more than reality
 bharat ke 2003 ke australia daure kii ek ghatana shaayad kumble ke vishesh nazariye kii ek jhalak pesh karti he
 Usually the top players of our country try to avoid such situations
 us samay kumble ko pehle brisben test main baitha diya gaya nnyonki do saal pehle kandhe kii chot se unka farm buree tarah prabhavit ho gaya tha
 In his place, Harbhajan Singh was given the command of the spin bowling attack for a short time
 pehle din ke khel ke baad kumble captain ganguli ke paas pahunche
 He told Ganguly that he wanted to announce his retirement after this Test and go home
 yah baat kisi dhamkee yaa ultimatum ke taur par nahin kahi gai thi kyonki unhen yakeenan lag rahaa tha ki unka vakt puraa ho gaya he
 Shocked, bewildered Ganguly explained to him that he would stay until the series was over
 ise niyati kaa pher kahen ki harbhajan kii ungali test ke dauraan chotil ho gai
 Kumble again came into the team and took 24 wickets in the next three games
 isse edilade main aitihaasik jeet hasil karne main madad mili
 They then reached the summit
 aakhir 2008 main jab unhone dilli ke firozshah kotla maidan main apane ritair hone kaa elaan kiya to ve team ke captain the
 Harbhajan explains that Kumble always valued the team more than his performance
 ve kehete hai, ''maine jab pehali baar dressing room main kadam rakhaa to ve mere liye ''kumble sar" the
 Soon when i went on a foreign tour, on many occasions i used to be the only spinner among eleven players
 lekin ''anil bhai" ne kabhi koi shikaayat nahin kii
 If the team would have benefited, they would not have even hesitated to sacrifice themselves
 " harbhajan unki nai bhoomika se khaasaa utsahit hai kyonki ''ham khushkismat hai ki dressing room main unka saath milegaa
 "despite the coach's persistent messages, Kumble will have to do a lot more
 sunil gavaskar ne likhaa ki kumble pramukh coach ban gaye to samajhie ''bhartiya cricket ke achche din jaldi hi aaenge
 "kapil Dev described it as a" bold move "that would make Indian cricket look more spectacular
 "lekin kumble ke liye asli sawaal to yah he ki ve cricket main coach kii bhoomika ko kaise dekhte hai or unka najariya nnya hoga
 It is an interesting debate that cricket coaches are traditionally different from the manager of football or basketball
 in khelon main sab kuch itnaa teji se chalata he or ek-ek khilaadi kii bhoomika itani kasi hui hoti he ki manager ko bas kinare baithkar ranneetiyon par dhyaan rakhane kii jarurat hoti he
 In contrast, in cricket, the case is slow that the captain gets time to decide the strategy and the coach is in the role of an assistant, not his boss
 jin tiimon main coach kaa dabadabaa kaayam hota he, vahaan hameshaa gadabadi hoti he
 For example, from 2005 to 2007, Team India and Greg Chappell always made headlines for other reasons
 kumble se unke koching ke nazariye ke bare main puuchhie to ve bahut kuch na bolkar bhi ishaara karte hai ki unka tarika chaupal se yathasambhav alag hoga
 "it is important for a coach to understand that he is not a player," he says
 meraa kaam prishthbhumi taiyaar karne kaa he
 The players have to express their opinion so that they can take a wise decision
 match shuru hone ke baad to captain ke haath hi kaman hoti he
 The only thing i can do is to have all the tools available to the captain, complete the preparations and try to ensure that every player is full of morale and enthusiasm
 "kumble kaa jin coach ke saath sabaka padaa he, unamem bharat ke pehle videshi coach newjiland ke jon rhite se ve kuch sabak lenaa chaahate hai
 He says, "his way was to look, train right, focus on fitness, always be available to the players and tell the necessary tips but let the captain lead
 unka yah tarika mere dimag ke ek kone main hameshaa bana rahegaa
 But i believe that the coach should also get his hands dirty, he should be in training, should run with the boys, put some balls on the net
 main yah sab bhi karuunga
 "kumble may also have to take a tough decision in the matter of sharing of captaincy between Kohli and Mahendra Singh Dhoni
 yah parampara unheen ke daur main shuru hui thi jab ve test captain the or dhoni chote sanskarnon kii captaini karne lage the
 Such things have started intensifying that Virat Kohli should be given the captaincy of every format
 nivartmaan coach shastri to isaki khulkar pairokari kar rahe the
 Kumble is not ready to say anything on this
 asal main ve isse kaaphi utsahit hai ki bhartiya team pratibhavan yuvaaon se bhari team he
 He says, "the average age is mid-bisec years
" test team ke captain viraat kareeb 40 test khel chuke hai
 The most experienced is Ishant, who has played 65 Tests
 unamem utsaah bharne kii kaaphi gunjaaish he, unhen seekhney-samajhane kii darkaar he
 i think i will be able to give something to this team and contribute to the game as well
 "isliye kumble ko kheltaa dekh badi hui peedi, jo yah sochati rahi he ki ve hameshaa bharat ke liye apana sab kuch daanv par lagane ko taiyaar rahete hai, ke liye unki coach ke rup main niyukti sukhad aashcharya kii tarah he
 The new coaches of India promise to spread their arms on the net away from the glare
 shaayad isse bhartiya cricket main nae daur kii shuruyaat ho
 After the demise of former chief minister and DMK chief m Karunanidhi and the AIADMK chief j Jayalalitha a year ago, the politics of Tamil Nadu has come to the forefront when new ideologies and new types of conflicts are taking birth in the state
 Huh
 lagbhag dedh saal se diemke ke kaaryakari adhyaksh ke rup main em ke stallin kii kshamta or takat kii kadi pariksha hui he
 It was under Stalin's leadership that the DMK contested the 2016 Assembly elections and the party suffered a second consecutive defeat
 yah party ke liye kisi bade jatke se kam na tha jab diemke sarkaar virdohi lahar ke baavjood satta main vaapasi nahin kar pai
 Not only this, after the death of Jayalalitha in 2017, the DMK candidate's bail was also forfeited in the RK Nagar by-election
 aar ke nagar vidhansabha upachunaav ke parinaam se stallin ko nai chunautiyon se rubaru hona padaa jab titivi dinakaran kaa naam ek lokapriy netaa ke taur par ubhara
 There was a discussion in the party that Stalin should rethink the centralized structure of the DMK which is being run by some of his chosen people
 tamilnadu kii raajnneeti main yah sab tab ho rahaa tha jab diemke lagaataar doosraa chunaav haar gai thi or ediemke bhi jayalalita kii maut ke baad bikhar gai thi
 In such a situation, under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Amit Shah, the BJP was exploring the possibility of entering the politics of the state
 yah daur tamilnadu kii raajnneeti main diemke ke bane rahane ke lihaaj se sabase mahatvapurn he jab vistaaravaadi bhaajapa kisi bhi dal ke liye ek inch bhi jameen chhodane ko taiyaar nahin he
 Today's DMK is completely different from the 70s and 80s DMK
 us samay main party ke paas duusari shrenee ke kaabil netaaon kaa acha khaasaa samooh tha jo iske sansthaapak sien annadurai kii vichaardhaara ko lekar janata main sangharsh karte the
 Along with this, there was also the leadership of an expert in politics like Karunanidhi
 jabaki aaj kii diemkemen to parivaar main hi sangharsh jari he
 Stalin has been facing challenges from his elder brother MK Alagiri
 pita kii maut ke baad alaagiri kaa ruukh kya hoga yah dekhne vaali baat hogi
 While Stalin is currently under no threat from other top party leaders and members of the Karunanidhi family, including Rajya Sabha mps Kanimozhi, a Raja and Dayanidhi Maran
 karunanidhi kii teesri patni rajati ammal kii beti kanimojhi dilli main karunanidhi ke daahine haath maane jane vaale murasoli maaran kii bhoomika nibhaa sakati hai
 Talking about AIADMK, even though Chief Minister e Palaniswami and Deputy Chief Minister o Panneerselvam are running the government together after the split in the party after Jayalalithaa's death, aiadmk's balance of power due to dominance in the party and TTV Dinakaran's growing popularity in the state
 Can go awry anytime
 bijepi ko isi raste rajya main pravesh kii sambhaavna dikh rahi he
 At the same time, two big faces from Tamil cinema, Kamal Haasan and Rajinikanth's new type of politics in the state have created a new challenge for both the important parties DMK and AIADMK
 haalanki abhi in donon abhinayta se rajaneta bane shakhsiyaton kii rajanithik takat kaa pareekshan hona shesh he
 But looking at the political history of Tamil Nadu, the politics of the state is dominated by the leaders from the cinema
 congress kii baat karen to rajya main diemke kii pehali sarkaar ke baad congress kii vaapasi kabhi nahin hui
 And in time, the role of the Congress has been that of a backward party
 silk smita film industry main sabase bold actress ke taur par jaani jaati hai
 The actress, who was active in South films, was quite popular in her era
 ek samay aisa tha ki south industry main popularity ke maamle main silk ne rajnikant or camel hasan jaise superstars ko takkar de di thi
 It is also believed that he had an affair with Rajinikanth
 unki deth aneverseri par bataa rahe hai rajnikant sang kisi thi actress kii bonding
 In the 80s, she became an overnight silk star with Kamal Haasan in the film
 actress ko bold image ke liye janaa jaataa tha
 It is said that Silk did many b grade movies or, if you believe, soft porn films
 kaha jaataa he ki us daur main rajnikant or camel hasan jaise star bhi silk kii popularity ko pachaa nahin paa rahe the
 Rajinikanth and Silk worked together in several films, including the 1983 film Jeet Hamari Hui, the 1983 film Thanga Magan, Payam Puli and Sivappu Surya Famous
 in filmon main inke dance muves kaaphi controvarsial rahe
 According to reports, Rajinikanth, despite being a familyman, was leaning towards silk
 khabaron kii maane to donon kaa afaire bhi tha or isi ke saath charchaa aisi bhi rahi ki rajnikant cigarette se silk kii body par daag bhi banaate the
 Well, there is no strong evidence behind these reports
 silk smita ko shoharat or daulat to khub mili lekin unhen apni jindagi main sookun ke pal nahin mili
 On 23 September 1996, Silk committed suicide
 2011 main ai vidya baalan abhinit film 'darty pikchar' silk smita kii jindagi par hi banaai gai thi

 One by one, we were going to see all the idols, then we paid special attention to the decorated statue in the corner
 rohit de ne kaha ki ye bihar praant kii he
 There is a statue of the Sun
 yaqiin nahin hua ki yahaan bihar kii kalakriti dekhne ko mil jaaegi
 Both thrill and curiosity surrounded him
 puratatvvettaon ne to aisi anek murtiyon dekhi hongi magar main pehali baar surya kii pracheen murti dekh rahaa tha
 Said first because people of Bihar worship the sun in Chhath Puja, just curious about whether this idol must have been related to the folk traditions of that time? It is not right to connect directly to the worshiping text
 aisa hota to us daur kii tamaam murtiyon sindur or chandan ke rang se rangi hoti
 Sun artwork in Yale University Museum, which came from Bihar
 photo-raveesh kumaar i have spent a lot of time at Patna Museum
 ek samay tak yahan ke kis kamare main koun si murti rakhi hoti thi, mujhe yaad rahata tha
 Now i have forgotten jahaan tak yaad aata he, aisi kalakriti nahin dekhi
 i wrote about Didarganj's Yakshi in 2014 on my blog Kasba
 richard ech davis kii kitaab livs of indian imagej
 In 1917 Maulvi Qazi Syed Mohammad Azimul saw the statue for the first time
 adbhut or kuubasurat murti he
 British officer EHC Balsh and Spooner went to Didarganj to bring this idol
 vahaan se laakar ise patna musium main rakh diya gaya
 Richard writes that not enough is known about this statue
 iskaa ateet sirf bhartiya kala ke pratik ke rup main darj hokar rah gaya
 There is a fear that even this idol of Suryadev may not be recorded as a mere symbol
 yel uniwarsity ke musium main maujuud surya kii kalakriti, jo bihar se ai he
 photo-ravish Kumar bihar main gyarahavin sadi main shilpkaar surya kii pratimaa rahe the, yah soch kar man utsahit ho gaya
 i want to know how many such idols would have been made
 kya surya kii aisi viksit murti gyaharwaan sadi se pehle kii bhi rahi hogi? What would have been his reference? a question naturally came up whether it would have been related to Chhath? meri itihaas kii training kahati he ki kuch bhi pramanik rup se kehane se pehle pataa kar lenaa chahie
 One might have researched ancient and medieval sculptures of the Sun
 isliye bina un sabake bare main jane ek seemaa se adhik kalpanaabaazi nahin kerani chahie
 There is some information about the Sun's artwork in the Museum of Yale University
 musium ke detail main jo baaten likhi hai ve behad sankshipt hai
 It is written that this artwork dates back to the Pala dynasty
 paal vansh kaa raaj bengal-bihar ke ilaake main tha magar yahan bihar praant likhaa hua he
 The Pala dynasty was related to the Mahayana tradition of Buddhism
 musium kii soochna pattica main likhaa hua he ki surya buddha or hindu paramparaon main maujuud rahe hai
 The face of the sun resembles the face of Buddhist statues
 kya chhath kaa sambandh buddha paramparaon se rahaa hoga? jis tarah se chhath main pujari kii bhoomika naganya he, usase yah mumkin lagata he
 For this, the development sequence of Chhath will also have to be seen

 Under his foot is a statue of Uma, who has been called the Goddess of Prabhat
 magar uma kaa sthaan paanv ke bich main hai
 Surya is considered one of the twelve children of the Goddess of Heaven
 in santanon ko aditya kehete hai
 Surya is one of them
 is murti main bich main surya hai
 The remaining eleven adityas are built

 Those on the bottom left side of the stomach and have a beard are described as Pingala
 daayin ore dwarpal hai
 There is some information about the Sun's artwork in the Museum of Yale University
 bihar main chhath(chhath Puja) ke samay surya kii murti banati he
 It is made on the chariot itself
 bahut pehle kii yaad he tab patna kii murtiyon main surya ko juuta pahane dekha tha
 It must have come from Iranian tradition
 pracheen iran kii pratimaaon main isht juuta pahana karte the
 Someone once said this, but they were not historians
 antim raay banane se pehle pukhta pramaan zaruri hote hai
 We have just made a curious comment

 " The long-awaited and ambitious aircraft carrier INS Vikramaditya was inducted into the Indian Navy on Saturday
 bharat kii samudri yuddh kshamta main yah bada ijapha he
 This war vessel was included in the ceremony held at Sevmash Shipyard in the Indian Navy

 The vessel, costing $ 3 billion, weighs 44,500 tons
 is samaaroh main raksha mantri eke antni or roosi up pradhanmantri dimitri rogogin tathaa sarkaar evam nausena ke varisht ke adhikari maujuud the
 According to the Russian news agency RIA Novosti, the documents related to the delivery of the vessel are signed by Igor Sevastyanov, deputy director of the Russian arms exporter company Rosoboronexport and the captain of the ship Suraj Berry
 is yudhpot ko pehle 2008 main saunpa janaa tha, lekin baar baar vilamb hota rahaa
 The flag of Russia was launched on the ship and replaced by the Indian Navy flag
 paramparaagat bhartiya rivaaj ke mutabik pot par ek nariyal phoda gaya
 It will be flown to India after a two-month trip under the supervision of a group of war ships
 ise arab sagar main karwaar tat par laayaa jayega
 What is Vikramaditya's specialty: INS Vikramaditya is a Kiev class aircraft carrier which was inducted into the Russian Navy in 1987 under the name of Baku
 baad main iskaa naam admiral gorshkove kar diya gaya or bharat ko peshkash kiye jane se pehle 1995 tak yah rus kii seva main rahaa
 The 284-meter-long warship will be deployed with a Navy warship of the mig-29 as well as the Komov 31 and Komov 28 anti-submarine warfare and maritime surveillance helicopters
 mig-29 ke bhartiya nausena ko mahatvapurn badhat dilaayenge
 Their range is 700 nautical miles and by refueling in the middle air its range can be increased to 1900 nautical miles

 5 arab dollar kaa praarambhik samjhauta hua or 16 mig-29 ke evam ke-yubi deck aadhaarit ladaaku vimaanon ke saude par hastakshar hua
 This aircraft carrier also soured relations between India and Russia
 baharhaal donon deshon ne ek atirikt samjhauta kiya jisamen bharat iske punarnirmaan par zyada keemat dene par raji hua
 In 1998, to end the deadlock, the government of the then Prime Minister of Russia, Yevgeny Primakov, offered to give the vessel to India free of cost, provided that it would pay for its repair and modernization
 yadhyapi kaary ke praarambhik moolyankan main jaruri parishram kii kami ke chalate uski keemat kaaphi bad gai jisase uski marammat or aadhunikeekaran kaa kaam ruk gaya
 The ship deal became a major bottleneck in bilateral relations
 varsh 2007 ke ant tak donon deshon ke bich sambandh girakar sabase nichle str par pahunch gayi the jab yah spasht ho gaya tha ki rus pot kii aapurti varsh 2008 kii samaysima tak nahin karegaa
 However the two countries entered into an additional agreement under which India agreed to pay a higher price for the ship's repair
 bhartiya adhikariyon ne nijee charchaaon main sweekaar kiya ki badi keemat ke baavjood yah ek acha sauda hoga kyonki uski tarah kaa pot antarrashtriya bazaar main doguni se kam keemat par nahin milegaa lekin koi bhi vimanavahak pot niryaat ke liye nahin banaata
 Inductively built and developed ALH Dhruv helicopters along with Seaking helicopters will also be deployed at INS Vikramaditya
 ienes vikramaditya par 1600 karmiyon kii tainaati rahegi or yah vastut: samudr par ek ‘tairte shahar’ kii tarah hoga
 The need for its equipment will also be considerable, such as about one lakh eggs, 20 thousand liters of milk and 16 tonnes of rice will be consumed in a month
 nausena kii ore se jari ek vijyapti main kaha gaya he, ‘purna khaadya saamagree ke saath yah pot samudr main 45 din tak rah saktaa he
 "the vessel is capable of operations up to a distance of seven thousand nautical miles or 13 thousand kilometers with a capacity of eight thousand tons," the release said
 ’ pot ko urja aath byleron se milti he or yah pot adhiktam 30 note pratighante kii gati hasil kar saktaa he
 Igor Leonov, Chief Delivery Commissioner, Sevamesh Shipyard, said, “almost everything is new on Vikramaditya
 ’leonav ne sevemesh main kaha ki pot kaa kareeb 40 pratishat penda mul vaala he baaki puri tarah se nayaa he
 He said, 'the Navy deployed its engineers and technicians on board the entire process of repair and modernization of the vessel
 nausena ne kai upkarnon, purjein or puri cabaling kii marammat karne kii bajaay use badalane kaa sahi nirnay kiya
 Leonov will lead the Guarantee team deployed on Vikramaditya's nearly two-month journey to reach Karwar's base on the west coast in India

 vahiin duusare din film kii kamai main jabardast giravat ai
 On the release day, while the film grossed Rs 50 crore 75 lakh, on the second day the film earned just Rs 28 crore 25 lakh
 saath hi ye bhi mana ja rahaa he ki film ke liye aage kii raah itani aasaan nahin hogi
 With the kind of response the film is getting from the audience, it is being speculated that it will be very difficult to maintain consistency for the film in terms of earnings
 jaahir taur par film ko negative publicity kaa nuksaan hua he
 Talking of records, the film has been successful in making many records on the first day itself

 The results of the by-election for Araria Lok Sabha seat on March 11 are coming today and the interesting thing is that on the one hand, the credibility of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar is at stake on the results of the by-election and the future of RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav on the other
 2014 loksabhaa chunaav main arriya seat par argedy ne fatah hasil kii thi or party ke saansad taslimuddin ne bijepi ke pradeep kumaar singh ko haraaya tha
 The seat was vacated after the death of Taslimuddin last year, on which by-elections were held
 gauratlab he ki, 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav megharriya loksabhaa sitmen argedy kaa sidhaa muqabla bijepi se tha jisamen 8 jilon par jeet hui thi lekin 11 march ko hue upachunaav main argedy kaa muqabla keval bijepi ummidavaar se nahin balki bijepi- jediu gathbandhan ke saajha ummidavaar pradeep kumaar singh se hua
 The results of these elections will indicate that BJP candidates in Araria Lok Sabha seat can do something amazing with the return of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar with BJP once again? Obviously, this is the first electoral examination for Nitish Kumar after breaking away from the grand alliance last year to form a government with BJP and the election results are a question of credibility for the Chief Minister
 vahiin duusari taraf argedy netaa tejasvi yadav ke raajnneetik bhavishya ke liye bhi arriya loksabhaa seat par jeet behad jaruri he
 Till now this seat was with RJD and in this way Tejashwi Yadav tried very hard so that RJD won this seat
 bataa den ki argedy supremeo lalu prasad yadav kii gairmaujuudagi main yah tejasvi yadav kii pehali chunavi pariksha he

 bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne centre kii yojanaon ko band karne kii salaah di he
 He said that this is our policy idea, every state should have its own scheme
 nitish kumaar ne kaha ki is maamle ko ham logon ne vitt ayog ke saamne bhi rakhaa he or 15 june ko nai dilli main hone vaali niti ayog kii baithak main bhi ise rakhenge
 In Patna, Nitish Kumar said that the central sponsored scheme should be closed, in which the state government has to impose 40-50 percent of its amount, but the name is of the center
 agar centre ko puure desh main koi skim chalaanaa ho to central sector skim hona chahie jisamen rajyon par koi bhaar na padey
 The Chief Minister said that it is necessary to consider this issue, if the name of any scheme is centrally sponsored, then why money is taken from the states in it, so if states have a stake then it should be considered as state sponsored
 nitish kumaar ne kaha ki har rajya kii apni-apni praathamikta hoti he or sabhi skim ko sabhi rajyon par thopanaa bhi sahi nahin he
 Every state should have its own scheme
 unhone kaha jab ham centre sarkaar main the tab centre pryojit yojanaon kii sankhya ko ghataane main hamaari bhoomika rahi he, is baat ko hamane endie kii baithkon main bhi rakhaa he
 Nitish Kumar said that even today, Bihar should get the status of special state
 niti ayog kii baithak main yah mudda hoga, hamane 15wein vitt ayog ke saamne bhi yah mudda uthaaya tha or aage bhi uthaate rahenge

 pakistan sarkaar or sena ne bhi masood ajahar kii maut kii khabar par chuppi saadh rakhi he
 However, sources have denied the news of Masood Azhar being killed
 sutron ke mutabik masood ajahar jinda he, lekin uski tabiyat najuk he
 He is undergoing treatment for liver cancer
 masood ajahar pakistani khufia agency iesai kii nigaraanee main he
 jaish-e-mohammed has also not confirmed the killing of Masood Azhar
 isse pehle pakistani videsh mantri shah mahmud kuraishi ne moulana masood ajahar ke biimaar hone kaa daawa kiya tha
 He had said that Masood Azhar is in Pakistan and he is so ill that he cannot leave his house
 aise main masood ajahar ke marane kii khabar ko lekar log soshal media par sawaal kar rahe hai
 Recently, there is a possibility of his being killed in an air strike in Balakot
 vahiin, bhartiya jaanch agenciyaan pakistan main jaish-e-mohammad masood ajahar kii maut kii khabar kii jaanch main jute gai hai
 Officials said that it is being ascertained whether Masood Azhar is dead or alive? Officials said they have no information other than that Masood Azhar is undergoing treatment at a Pakistani Army hospital
 uske gurde kharaab ho chuke hai
 Masood Azhar, a resident of Bahawalpur in Punjab province of Pakistan, formed jaish-e-mohammed terrorist organization in 2 thousand
 masood ajahar par 2001 ke sansad hamale kii sajeesh rachane, jammu kashmir vidhansabha par aatmghaatee hamale, pathankot vayusena ke thikaane main hamale or pulavama aatanki hamale kii sajeesh rachane ke aarope hai
 In 1999, the then NDA government abandoned Masood Azhar to replace Indian Airlines' hijacked aircraft IC-814

 Twitter user Devika tweeted that Indian media is again running propaganda of Pakistan
 masood ajahar jinda bhi ho saktaa yaa nahin bhi jinda ho saktaa he, lekin bina kisi khufia jaankaree ke masood ko mara bataanaa morrkhtaa he
 Remember that Pakistan is protecting Masood Azhar from international pressure
 Indian media is again making up a circus, playing into Pak's propaganda
 Masood Azhar may or may not be alive but to declare him dead without any intel confirmation is so foolish
 Remember Pak is guarding him against Int'l pressure, they'd want everyone to believe he's dead

 Then finally he is shot
 iske baad murda samaj kar use tees feet gahare kuen main phenk diya jaataa he
 The girl from the well is injured and she is breathing with the help of machine
 ladki thik se khaanaa bhi nahin kha paa rahi he kyonki jis pet main khaanaa pahunchataa he us pet main goli dhansi he
 The rest of the body is from where it is being investigated
 magar haalat dekh kar khud doctor hairaan hai ki ye jinda kaise batch gai? or phir khud doctor hi iskaa raaj bhi khol rahe hai ki wo jeena chaahati he
 Wants to win bas isliye ji rahi he
 The incident of December 6 was repeated again, which happened with Nirbhaya on the back seat of the bus on December 16, three years ago, again after three years
 ladki is baar bhi dilli kii he
 This time too, the girl was picked up from Delhi
 or phir 14 dinon tak use dilli se kareeb tees kilometre dur greater noida main kaid kar nocha jaataa rahaa
 Then the spectacle of law was made in the bus, this time law was in the well
 dilli se 22 november ko ek ladki ko agava kiya jaataa he
 He is put in a car and taken to a farm house in Greater Noida, near Delhi
 iske baad agle 14 dinon tak tak wo rojaanaa teen se chaar ladakon kii havas kaa shikaar banati he
 Then on the fifteenth day the girl is shot when she tries to escape
 ladki ne sunai apni aabithigoliyon se ghayal ladki ne faqat ishaaron bhar main larazati jubaan se apni kahani sunai, iske baad isiu kii khaali chat ko khaali nazaron se ghurti he
 After seeing so much everything, even the parents of the girl themselves could not muster enough courage to wait a few more seconds with him
 wo baahar aa gaye or khud bhi rone lage
 How many times would she scream in a deserted farm house for 14 days
 har roj wo vahashi jab-jab use khaanaa dene aate pehle uskaa jism nochate
 She screamed a lot but nobody heard her scream
 wo vahashi puure 14 dinon tak use usee tarah nochate-khasotate rahe phir havas puri karne ke baad use farm house main band kar chale jate
 There was no one here to hear the screams of the girl
 goli maar kar daalaa kuen mendilli se 22 november ko ek ladki ko agava kiya jaataa he
 He is put in a car and taken to a farm house in Greater Noida, near Delhi
 iske baad agle 14 dinon tak tak wo rojaanaa teen se chaar ladakon kii havas kaa shikaar banati he phir pandrahawein din jab ladki bhaagane kii koshish karti he to use goli maar di jaati he
 The girl is shot and dumped in a thirty feet deep well in a deserted area between fields outside Salempur village, about thirty kilometers from Delhi
 ladkee kuen ke andar se hi cheekhnaa shuru karti he
 Jism continued to bleed after being shot
 or wo jab tak cheekh sakati thi cheekhti rahi, is ummid main ki shaayad koi uski cheekh sun le
 And finally on the fifteenth day a passerby heard her scream coming out of the well and with the help of the villagers, she was taken out
 dost hi niklaa dushmanek garib parivaar se taalluk rakhane vaali 19 saal kii ladki subah kareeb paanch baje ghar se doodh lene baahar ai thi
 Then he found a friend of his
 baat karte-karte vahi dost use sadak kinare khadi ek gaadi ke kareeb le gaya
 After this, the girl was suddenly forcibly seated
 gaadi main bithaate hi unhone ladki ko behosh kar diya taaki wo cheekh-pukaar naa kar sake
 After this, when the girl became aware, she found herself in a room at a secluded place
 wo jagah shaayad greatrnoidaka tugalpur gaanv tha
 The girl was taken to a farm house in the village
 iske baad paanch disambar tak ladki usee farm house main bandhak ban kar rahi
 When the boys who picked him up would go out of the farm house, they would lock it
 is dauraan ladki madad ke liye lagaataar cheekhti
 For the entire 14 days, those boys continuously gang-raped her
 vahi rojaanaa ladki ke liye khaanaa lekar aate or phir use nochate
 The girl was shot by two bullets on five December ie Saturday evening, the girl got a chance to escape from the farm house
 lekin ladakon ne use raste hi main pakad liya or pakade jane ke dar se ladki ko do goli maari
 Then, considering it to be a corpse, he was thrown into this well at around nine o'clock at night
 ladki tab tak jinda thi or hosh main bhi
 After some time, when he realized that they were all gone, he started screaming for help
 ladki kii bahaduree dekh doctor bhi hairandoctor bhi hairaan hai ki aakhir ye ladki jinda kaise batch gai? ladki ne badi bahaduree se aspataal main hi naa sirf police ko balki magistrate ke saamne bhi apana bayaan diya
 The girl also named the boys who gang-raped her
 ladki kii shuruuaati ilaaj ke baad dilli police kii dekharekh main use apollo aspataal main bhartee karaayaa gaya he
 According to the police, the girl is in a state of speech and has given her statement
 police ke mutabik shuruuaati bayaan main usne krishna, vipin or banty naam ke ladakon ke naam liye hai
 One of these girl friends is the friend of the friend
 aropiyon kii talash main juty pulicepulice ke mutabik siarpisi kii dhara 164 ke tahat magistrate ne bhi aspataal jaakar ladki kaa bayaan kalamband kar liya he
 After the same statement, the police have started looking for all those boys

 Several operations have been done and efforts are being made to remove the pellets from the abdomen and stomach
 haalanki goli lagane ke baad puri raat kuen main padi rahane kii vajah se uske jism se bahut sara khun bah chukaa he
 Nothing changed even after 16 December? After 16 December 2012, there was an expectation that no more innocent people would be victim of some crazy rage? But in both Delhi and the country, the incidence of rape has reduced
 isi 16 disambar ko nirbhaya haadase ko teen saal puure ho jaaenge par uske gunahagaaron kaa cese ab bhi adaalat main latak rahaa he
 The final sentence is still awaited
 jis nirbhaya ne puure desh ko rape ke khilaaf ek jute kar diya tha
 Three years have passed since that case and even today that case is waiting for its result

 The Election Commission on Tuesday rejected the plea of janata Party chief Subramanian Swamy seeking revocation of the Congress Party's recognition on the ground that it had violated the rules by giving a loan of Rs 90 crore to a company
 mukhya nirvachan ayukta ve es sampath kii adhyakshata main ayog ne swami kii arji khaarij karte hue kaha ki unki yachika kisi raajnneetik dal kii manyata samaapt karne ke liye nirdhaarit kisi bhi aadhaar ke tahat nahin aati he
 In a letter sent to Dr
 Swamy, the Election Commission said, 'the basis you have stated for revoking the party's recognition does not fall under any of the grounds laid down for the political party's recognition
 ayog ne kaha ki swami dwaara chunaav chinh (aarakshan evam aavanton) aadesh 1968 ke para 16e kaa hawala dete hue likhe gayi teen or paanch navambar ke patr vichaar yogya nahin hai
 Under this provision, if a party fails to follow the Election Code of Conduct or any directive of the Commission, the Commission has the right to suspend or withdraw its recognition
 ayog ne yah bhi spasht kiya he ki jan pratinidhitav kanoon kii dhara 29bi or 29si main praavdhaan he ki dhara 29e ke tahat panjikrut koi raajnneetik dal kis tarah se apane liye dhan kii vyavastha karegaa
 But there is no such provision in this law that states how political parties will use this money
 ayog ne yah bhi kaha ki swami ke aaropon ke anusaar agar party ne iskar kanoon 1961 ke kisi praavdhaan kaa kathith rup se paalan nahin kiya he to yah maamla uske adhikaar kshetra main nahin he
 In a letter written to the Election Commission on November 3, Swamy had said that prima facie the Congress had committed an offense under the Election Act and the Income Tax Act and it is necessary to hear the matter and decide on the termination of the party's recognition
 ayog ko likhe patr main swami ne aarope lagaaya tha ki sonia gandhi ke netritav vaali bhartiya rashtriya congress ne associated jarnals privet limited naam kii company ko 90 karod rupee se zyada kaa karj dekar niyamon kaa ulanghan kiya he isliye uski manyata khatm kii jaye
 The commission also took Swami's charge of questioning his impartiality seriously and called them completely baseless and turned down
 ayog ne kaha ki swami ne jis akhbaar kii khabar kaa hawala diya he usase ayog kaa koi lenaa dena nahin he
 The Commission also said that it had not taken any decision on November 3 or 4
 isliye faisle ko li karne kaa koi prashn hi nahin uthta he
 Swamy had said in his letter that the Associated Journal received an unsecured loan of Rs 90 crore from the Congress party, which he claimed to be illegal under the Income Tax Act as political parties cannot provide loans for commercial purposes
 unhone apane patr main likhaa, ‘yah rin raajnneetik dalon ke panjikaran or manyata ke niyamon or dishanirdeshon kaa ulanghan he
 Section 13A of the Income Tax Act and Section 29A of the Representation of the People Act (RPA) make no provision for lending to political parties with interest or interest to a company
 ’congress ne swami ke aaropon ko khaarij karte hue un par tathyon ko tod marod kar pesh karne or jhootha dushprachaar karne kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 Party general secretary Janardan Dwivedi had said how could there be any commercial purpose in this regard when no interest was charged on the loan
