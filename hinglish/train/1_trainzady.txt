 When people have problems in the world of viewers created by news channels, then their names are cut from the bookkeeping of the viewers
 aap dekhenge ki sari bahes do dalon ke netaaon ke aas-paas gum rahi he or logon kii awaz kisi ke aas-paas nahin pahunch rahi he
 Today you are not among these people, but whenever you will become a people with your problem, that is, you will come on the road, search the media, no one will come for you

 There were many demonstrations in Delhi on Sunday

 The arrival of people at Jantar Mantar or Ramlila Maidan is no longer news for anyone, but the news is that people are still coming
 channelon ke liye nahin balki janata bane rahane ke liye sadakon par aa rahe hai
 On March 3, Jajant Mantar at the Youth Council of India, the Bugul Mazdoor Squad also participated in this demonstration

 ek hi baat kii do-do baar ghoshnaa ho gai
 a new money has not yet come into his account
 pradhanmantri narendra modi 18 sitambar 2018 ko elaan karte hai ki anganwari varkar or aashaa varkar ko badha hua paisa 1 aktubar se milegaa
 Money will come before Diwali
 phir 1 farvari ke bajet main vitt mantri ne jo elaan kiya wo kya tha
 When Shivani Kaul of the Delhi State Anganwadi Workers and Helpers Association told this, we were not even sure that the announcement of the Prime Minister, which was announced by the Prime Minister in September, is announced again in the budget
 anganwari varkar or helper kaa kaam bahut mahatvapurn hota he
 Their achievements are redeemed by the government and governments, but never recognizes their work
 nunatam mazaduri se bhi kam par kaam karti hai
 There are around 11000 Anganwadi centers in Delhi itself

 Demonstrations demanded that since 1975, a plan is being made to directly pay money for the removal of thousands of women workers from the Integrated Child Development Scheme
 shivani kaul kaa kahana he ki yah sthaayee kaam he
 50,000 Anganwadi workers have been demonstrating since February 8 in Delhi's neighboring state of Haryana
 vahaan mukhyamantri manohar laal khatter ne kaha tha ki 11,400 denge magar aaj tak vah paisa nahin mila
 Demonstrations are going on in many districts about this
 har jagah anganwari varkar kii maang he ki unhen theke kii jagah sthaayee karmchaaree kii manyata mili or sammanjanak paisa mili
 Public issues are missing on the occasion of elections, leaders are holding issues on their behalf

 There was a rally in Jantar Mantar and Ramlila Maidan regarding the rights of workers
 jab sarkaar mazaduron ke kanoon main badlaav karti he to angrezi akhabaaron main vaahvahee hoti he
 But how the worker sees those changes or what happens to them due to those changes, we do not know
 ramlila maidan se jantar mantar tak mazaduron kaa march niklaa
 This march came out on behalf of many organizations including the Trade Union Center of Karnataka, Odisha, BHEL Mazdoor Trade Union and Mazdoor Right Struggle Campaign, Massa, which fought for the rights of workers
 kanoonon main badlaav kar permanent naukari ko samaapt kiya ja rahaa he or theke kii naukari ko badhaava diya ja rahaa he
 The workers do not get more than 8 to 10,000 money
 inaki maang he ki 25,000 rupee nunatam mazaduri kii jaae
 The right to form a union should be recognized
 theke par naukari ko badhaava nahin dena chahie
 The workers are also citizens
 anganwari varkar se lekar kisaan tak naagarik hai magar chunavi charchaa se baahar kar die gaye hai
 On March 3, paramilitary forces also came to Delhi's Jantar Mantar with their demands
 jinhen lekar channelon main rashtrabhakti ke aakraamak kaarykram chal rahe hai
 There are attacks on the questions that the morale of the paramilitary forces will drop by asking this, but when the paramilitary forces come to Jantar Mantar with their questions, then what media can you ask to boost their morale
 24 farvari or 3 march ko ardhsainik balon ke do-do pradarshan hue jinhen susheel mahapatra or rajeev ranjan ne cover kiya
 Ex-servicemen and officers of retired paramilitary forces demonstrate their demands but hearings are not held

 They say that political parties are cashing the Pulwama case for themselves, but no one pays attention to their demand
 ardhsainik balon kii maang he ki sabhi rajyon main ek hi tarah kaa muawza hona chahie taaki siarpief or anya ardh sainik balon ko lekar koi bhedbhaav nahin he
 The protest on February 24 also included everyone from jawans to officers
 is pradarshan ko susheel mahapatra ne cover kiya tha
 They demand that in every district, there should be a paramilitary board like the Sainik Board so that the soldiers do not have to come to Delhi for every work
 ardhsainik balon ke liye channelon par jo bhavukta paidaa kii ja rahi he, raajnneeti ke zarie jo kii ja rahi he wo in balon ke liye kam he, un balon ke liye zyaada he jise vot kehete hai
 Now talk of a new slogan
 na loksabhaa na vidhansabha, sabase bada gram sabha
 Seeing these pictures, it was felt that we are left to see so much of the country in the matter of debate
 2 march ko dantewada ke bailadila kii pahadiyon se yah raily nikali or 15 kimi tak padayatra chali
 In Delhi, the rally of 500 people riding on the bike gets covered in the name of Vijay Rally, but imagine yourself how TV disappears from the public
 is raily main gram sabha ko loksabhaa or vidhansabha se bada bataaya ja rahaa he
 Because their leaders allege that in 2014 by calling a gram sabha in a village, Adani Enterprise was given an iron mine
 hamane adani enterprise se sampark karne kaa prayaas kiya he
 We will definitely show favor, but this matter is of the district administration
 agar farji gram sabha hui he to ise panchayat adhikariyon kii madad se zila prashasan ko hi sabit karnaa he
 If gram sabhas have also been done in a fake way, then there should be a serious investigation
 20 gaanv ke adivasee log is padayatra main shaamil hue the
 The CEO of the Center's National Mineral Development Corporation and Chhattisgarh Mineral Development Corporation asked Prabhakar Rao about this because this joint venture got the mine lease after the permission of Gram Sabha
 uske baad ise adani group ko transfar kiya gaya
 CIO Prabhakar Rao has written a letter to the Collector of Dantewada after this demonstration to investigate this charge
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki jab 2014 main farji gram sabha bulaane kii baat he tab us vakt shikaayat kyon nahin ai
 This was not the only purpose of this march

 In this rally, slogans were raised against the Central and State Government

 gauratlab he ki nitish kumaar ne buudhvaar ko kaha tha ki uttar pradesh main bhi mahagathbandhan kaa formula safal ho saktaa he agar samaajawaadee party or bahujan samaaj party donon saath aa jaae
 Sushil Modi said that no one in UP is asking Nitish Kumar, who kept silence on the triple talaq system that harasses millions of Muslim women and thrashed the terrorists killed
 mahagathbandhan vahaan nahin ban saktaa kyonki mulaayam yaa mayawati main se koi bhi nitish kii tarah apane virdohi netaa ke pair par girane vaala nahin he
 Modi also hit out at Lalu, saying the RJD chief has worked to set fire to the grand alliance by getting Shahabuddin to make a statement against Nitish Kumar in the Grand Alliance government
 twit kar susheel modi ne likhaa ki agar mahagathbandhan sarkaar main shaamil do pramukh dal, janata dal united or rashtriya janata dal main sab kuch thik-thaak he to phir kyon lalu yadav ko baar-baar bharosa dilaanaa pad rahaa he ke mahagathbandhan kii sarkaar puure 5 saal chalegi? modi ne kaha ki agar mahagathbandhan sarkaar main sab kuch thik-thaak he to phir kyon sarkaar kii kaarykaal par roj bulatin jari karne kii jarurat padati he
 Is the world really moving towards the third world war? If yes, why and how? After all, who is going to start this third world war? Is it not so that the existence of this world equipped with atomic bombs ends due to this world war? The way the world's two nuclear power countries, North Korea and the United States are threatening to press the button of the atomic bomb, it has increased this danger even further
 america main missile hamale kaa alarm dab gaya
 There was a risk of attack from ballistic missiles near the border of Hawaii
 adhikariyon ke phone parapatkaaleen chetavaneepahunchi
 Actually, when the emergency alarm button was pressed accidentally, America remembered Kim Jong Un's threat
 kyonki kim ne use parmaanu batan dabaane kii dhamkee di thi
 Responding to the threat, the threat Sekim said, "I have a button on my bomb on the table, i will press anytime
 ' udhar america ke raashtrapati trump ne use jawaab dete hue kaha tha 'mere paas tumse bhi bada batan he or ye kaam bhi karata he
 'one is threatening to have an atomic bomb button on its table, the other is saying that i have a bigger button than you and it works too
 ab jab duniya ke do parmaanu shakti sampann desh or uske netaa is andaaz main baat karen, to darana lazimi he
 This is the reason that from the second world war till now, the world has certainly touched all the ranks of progress, but the fear of the third world war still haunts her
 america or north korea banenge tisare vishwayuddh kii vajahawaise to duniya par mandaraate tisare vishwayuddh ke khatre kii tamaam vajahen hai
 But at the top of these reasons is the relationship between America and North Korea
 uttar korea main in dinon taanashaah kim jong un kaa raaj he, jiske bare main kaha jaataa he ki wo behad garam dimag, sangdil or beraham he
 So much so that whoever he feels threatened on his chair, he does not delay in killing her, even if she has her own blood? In such a situation, the US considers the button of nuclear bombs in the hands of a dictator as the biggest threat in the world and in any case wants to take away and destroy North Korea from its nuclear power
 suraksha ke liye parmaanu bamajabaki duusari ore uttar korea america ko naa sirf apana sabase bada dushman maanata he, balki ye bhi kahata he ki uttar korea ke tamaam hathiyaar uski apni suraksha yani hifaazat ke liye hai
 For its survival, it will not back down from targeting the US for its nuclear weapons
 or to or uttar korea antarrashtriya paabandiyon or yuan kii roak ke baavjood tabadatod parmaanu pareekshan bhi karata ja rahaa he
 In such a situation, this mutual conflict of two nuclear power is the biggest reason for the Third World War
 padosi deshon se uttar korea kii dushmanilekin baat sirf in donon mulkon ke karaab rishton kii nahin he
 North Korea is a country which has a figure of 36 from many of its neighboring countries
 phir chaahe wo japan ho, dakshin korea ho yaa phir vietnam
 In fact, from the time of its existence after the Second World War, Russia has been affected by North Korea, whereas South Korea has been influenced by America
 japan se badi north korea kii talkhiudhar, haal ke kuch saalon main japan or dakshin korea donon hi america ke behad qareebi mitra ban chuke hai
 In such a situation, North Korea's tantrums with these countries are constantly increasing
north Korea is severely irritated as japan or dakshin korea main jab-jab america fujen abhyaas karti hai, uttar korea buree tarah chidh jaataa he
 In such a situation, whether the spark of North Korea falls on Japan, South Korea, Vietnam or America itself, the third world war is sure to erupt
 uttar korea kii madad karenge kai deshdusri taraf rus, china, pakistan or bulgaria jaise mulk uttar korea ke qareebi maane jate hai
 Despite being isolated from the world, North Korea's business and political relations with China are extremely good

 The whole country is waiting for his return
 vahiin wagha border par abhinandan kaa swaagat karne pahunche logon main baari utsaah or josh he
 56 hours after Pakistan's capture, Abhinandan was returned by Pakistan and now our heroic son is with us
 lekin ye bharat kii vir putr ke shaury or bharat kii takat or parakram kii jeet he
 Let us tell you how India completed this difficult mission in just 56 hours with strict attitude and diplomatic stakes
 pulavama main 14 farvari ko aatanki hamalaa hua to hamaari vayusena ne 26 farvari ko pakistan ke andar 100 kilometre tak ghuskar pakistan main balakot or pioke ke aatanki thikaanon par kahar barapa diya
 Buoyed by Indian action, Pakistan entered India the next day to answer
 PAK plane ko aise kiya nestnabud27 farvari ko subah 10 baje ke aasapaas bhartiya seemaa main ghuse pakistani vimaan F16 ko abhinandan ne ne apane parakram se aasmaan main pakistan ke atyaadhunik epa-16 vimaanon ke chakke chhudaa die
 The Jabanj pilot drove the F16 from the old mig aircraft MIG 21 Bison
 F16 kaa malba pakistan adhikrut kashmir main mila
 Post your Cellute, Message to Wing Commander Abhinandan Here, the mig-21 Bison of Wing Commander Abhinandan also came in the grip of this battle in the same manner
 darasal dushmano ke khadedate hue mig-21 bysan main ab kuch bhi ho saktaa tha
 In such a situation, the wing commander jumped from the parachute to Abhinandan and when he reached the ground the area was of pok
 abhinandan ke hausale se post pakistandushman ke vimaan ko maar giraane ke liye pioke main ghuse abhinandan ne dushman ke kabje main jaakar bhi adamya saahas dikhaaya
 When his plane fell, he surprised Pakistanis even by showing his might
 pakistani akhbaar don kii report ke mutabik pioke main parachute se abhinandan ek talab main koode or kuch dastavej or maps nigalane kii koshish kii
 Abhinandan asked the people gathered there whether he was in India or Pakistan
 In response to which a child cunningly said that he is in India
 payalat ne iske baad naare lagaae or poocha ki bharat main vah kis jagah par hai
 The same boy told Abhinandan that he was in the fort
 abhinandan ke deshprem bhare naaron ko kuch pakistani yuva pachaa nahin paae or pakistan army jindabad kaa naaraa laga diya
 Abhinandan understood that he was in Pakistan but without fear he fired in the air
 haathon main pathar liye hue logon ko daraane ke liye bhartiya payalat ne hawa main firing kii
 Even in this difficult situation, Abhinandan maintained courage and took care of the safety of ordinary citizens of Pakistan
 vah ek talab main koode or apni jeb se kuch document nikaalkar unhen nasht karne kii koshish kii, taaki pakistani sena ke haath kuch naa aa paae
 After this, Pakistan released a video in which the army officer was asking them a question and they were clearly refusing to answer
 dushman kii kaid main hone ke baavjood bhartiya payalat abhinandan kii himmat bilkul bhi dagamagaati dikhaai nahin detii he

 uri hamale ke baad bhartiya fouj kaa sargical strike pakistan pehle hi dekh chukaa tha
 The generals of the Pakistani Army sitting in Rawalpindi also understood that this is the new India - which can also enter and kill the enemy's house
 ek ore bhartiya fouj pakistan ko sabak sikhaane main koi kasar nahin chhod rahi he to duusari ore puri duniya aatankwaad ke khilaaf jang main hindustan ke saath he
 US President Donald Trump had already indicated that there was some good news to come
 duniya kii mahashaktiyaan bhi pakistan ko kosne main lagi thi or pakistan main aatanki thikaanon par bhartiya vayusena kii karrwai ke saath khadi dikhi
 In such a situation, Pakistan has no option but to show itself as a messenger of peace
 bharat ne pakistan ko benakaab karte hue duniya ke zyaadaatar deshon ko bataaya ki kisne apane air spes band kiye? samjhauta express ko kisne band kiya? bharat apni dharti par or aatanki hamale bardaasht nahin karegaa? pakistan ke yunonmad kaa puraa muqabla kiya jayega? is bich bharat ne pulavama aatanki hamale ke taar pakistan se jude hone ke bare tamaam sabooton vaala dogier pakistan ko bhej diya he
 Meaning, India completely surrounded Pakistan
 ye bharat kii ore se khinchi gai lakshmana rekha thi
 This meant that if our pilot did not return safely, there would be direct action against Pakistan
 pakistan bharat ke gusse ko samaj gaya or bharat ke vir sapoot abhinandan ko lautaane kaa elaan khud pakistani pradhanmantri imran khan ko 30 ghante ke andar karnaa padaa
 However, Pakistan did a lot of calculations before leaving the pilot Abhinandan
 abhinandan ko aage kar saudebaaji kii script likhni chaahi
 However, no bets worked
 bharat ne saaf-saaf kah diya ki wo islamabad ke kisi jubaani jhaanse main nahin aayega
 Today, Hindustan is hailing its brave pilot who is coming to see the climate of Pakistan, but India's position is clear that Masood Azhar, the mastermind of Pulwama incident, cannot roam free for a long time

 In which the Prime Minister comes and meets the media persons
 yah kaarykram lagbhag 1 ghante kaa hota he
 On Saturday, October 28, at 11 am, a program of Diwali meeting has been organized in the bungalow number 9 along the BJP headquarters 11 Ashok Road
 diemke ne 2−ji maamle main fansi kanimojhi ke liye kanoonee ladaai ladane kaa faisla kiya he
 The high level meeting of the party took place in Chennai on Wednesday
 diemke pramukh karunanidhi kii beti or saansad kanimojhi kaa naam 2 ji ghotaale main aane ke baad party kii yah baithak behad ahm rahi
 In fact, for the first time, a charge sheet has been filed on a member of DMK chief Karunanidhi's family, about which the party is very angry, but no decision has been taken at this meeting regarding the relationship with the Congress
 diemke ke party prastaav main kaha gaya he ki 2ji spectrum mudde kaa istemaal party ko badnaam karne ke liye kiya ja rahaa he
 After the meeting, Karunanidhi told reporters, "we will take legal steps to prove the truth
" somvaar ko dilli kii ek adaalat main sibiai ke poorak aaropapatr main kanimojhi kaa naam aaropee ke rup main shaamil kiye jane ke baad is baat kii atakalein lagaai ja rahi thi ki diemke koi sakht kadam uthaa sakati he or vah kendriya mantrimandal ko chhodane tak kaa faisla kar sakati he
 When asked if Kanimozhi would appear in a CBI court in Delhi on May 6, Karunanidhi responded positively
 kanimojhi ko isi adaalat ne saman bheja he
 He said, she (kanimozhi) is not Jayalalithaa, who should ignore the summons of the court
 karunanidhi ne aay se adhik sampatti ke maamle main annadramuk pramukh jayalalita dwaara bengalooru kii ek adaalat main vyaktigat rup se pesh hone se chhot maangane kii baat kaa zikr karte hue aisa kaha

 gauratlab he ki kumaar ko bhi adaalat ne saman bheja he
 Karunanidhi, in response to a question, said that his party would not face any trouble on the issue
 is baithak main ek prastaav bhi sweekaar kiya gaya, jisamen kaha gaya he ki kuch partiyaan samprag ke sahyogi dalon main vishwaas kii kami paidaa karnaa chaahati he or gathbandhan ko todna chaahati he
 It added that the 2G case is being used to humiliate the DMK
 poorak aaropapatr main kanimojhi kaa naam shaamil kiye jane par prastaav main bhi hairat jataai gai he
 (also from input language) yah raajnneeti kaa photocol he
 Every moment is a photo for the leader
 netaaon kaa photo prem nayaa nahin he
 Every city in India is filled with photos of leaders
 postaron par ve kisi devdoot kii tarah badhai or sandesh dete nazar aate hai
 These posters are also changing
 pehle passport saise photo ko bada kar laga diya jaataa tha, ab kisi ko dulaarte, puchkaarte yaa paidal march karte hue netaa kii tasviir postaron kaa hissaa banane lagi he
 The use of photos in politics has changed since the year of 2012
 itnaa badal gaya he ki ab photo ke paar jaakar dekh paanaa mushkil hota ja rahaa he
 It will be seen carefully that the space of your political thought has been filled with photos
 subah subah twitor par photo kaa aana chaalu ho jaataa he
 Who are they meeting, what are they wearing and whom are they giving
 har mulaakaat ko ek photo main tabdeel kar use prapanch or prachaar kaa hissaa banaaya ja rahaa he
 The photo of the opponent is mocked and the photo of the leader of his party is promoted
 us mulaakaat main kya hua, uske baad kya nateeja niklaa isaki jaankaree kam hoti he lekin photo aa jaataa he
 My life is my message
 gandhi ke is kathan ko aaj badal kar meraa photo hi meraa sandesh he kar diya janaa chahie
 Political competition has started on the photo
 jab bhi kisi netaa yaa ohadedaar kii chhavi karaab hoti he yaa wo vivaadon main aata he, wo agle hi din kisi photo spot par nazar aa jaataa he
 When he starts traveling in a train, he starts meeting someone poor
 koi kisi vijeti se milte hi twit karne lagata he to koi chadar chadhaane se pehle timeline par uskaa photo chadha detaa he
 Sometimes it seems that the leader will leave the security personnel one day and start walking with the four photos
 chal to rahe hai magar photo hi ab loktantric raajnneetik suraksha kaa nayaa hathiyaar ho gaya he
 Photo of him sitting in the train, photo of where he is going to get off the train
 soshal media par is photo or us photo main tulana hoti he
 Look, they are going alone in the empty compartment, see they are going with everyone in the loaded bogie
 suchanaaen kam ho rahi hai
 Questions are getting less answers
 bas photo bhej diye jate hai
 There is no photo of the work done, but there is a photo of it showing while working
 aap sawaal kiijie ki kaam nahin ho rahaa he to agle din kisi jagah par jaakar netaa ji photo khinchavaa aate hai
 The political person must campaign and tell about his work, but sometimes it seems that it is getting excessive
 kya twitor or fasebuk par har din lakhon mitric photo kachra paidaa kiya ja rahaa he
 An image does not last long
 jab ek photo se aap aahlaadit hote hai doosraa photo aa jaataa he ki are aap bekaar main khush ho rahe the
 See this photo aap kisi bhi sarkari mukhiya yaa pravaktaaon ke twit dekhiye
 Information is less, photo is more
 vayusena ke jahaaz se utarate saamaanon or logon kii tasveeron kii bharmaar he
 It seems that all these are being made for photo only
 ek baar nahin baar baar aisi tasviren twit ho rahi hai
 From Yemen to Nepal, the commendable work has been converted into photo-work
 zarur isse dharna badali he or desh kaa naam bhi hota he lekin kya chhavi hi in prayaason kii ekmaatr soochna he
 You can see how many such pictures
 aisa lagata he ki sara aaparishan vishalkay jahaazon ke bhitari maidaanon main hi chal rahaa he
 Disaster or aid operations are full of information and lessons, but all that is missing now
 geetkaar or lekhak neelesh misra kii baat thik lagi ki garv hota he ki bharat pahal kar rahaa he lekin pal-pal kii tasveeron kaa pradarshan kuch khatak rahaa he
 Help has its own dignity, but publicity should also have a limit
 seva hamaara dharm he to yah bhi bhartiya darshan he ki kisi kii madad karo yaa kisi ko kuch do to har kisi se mat kaho
 The government or political party must strike a balance
 niswaarth seva ko prachaar seva main nahin badla janaa chahie
 Many state governments have also tried to convert these occasions into photo worthy commendable works
 jab centre sarkaar kar hi rahi he to alag alag rajya sarkarein kyon kud rahi hai
 Many people from Nepal are saying that names of help are coming here
 photo khinchaa kar chale ja rahe hai
 The same situation has also happened for voluntary organizations
 har madad ko ek sankhya main badla ja rahaa he or ek ek sankhya ko jod kar hazaar tak pahunchaaya ja rahaa he
 The number is a new weapon in this photo war
 har netaa ke paas selfi or photo ke liye vakt he
 If you ask the common man, we will get cried that so-and-so e-mailed the leader, even went home but did not meet
 kaam to nahin hua par mulaakaat kii photo twit ho gai
 The comments aisi hi hode vipaksh main ho gai he
 a formula has become that a good photo can make someone a good leader
 vaicharik vimarsh kam paidaa kiye ja rahe hai
 Photo struggle is happening more
 rahul gandhi yatra par hai
 Are on a photo-trip in a way
 har pal kii tasviir he
 If the ruling party has become photo-side then the opponent has also become photo-side
 photo kaa jawaab photo he
 From the ship to the train are seen with the children
 thik usee tarah jaise pradhanmantri ruk kar selfi khinchane lagate hai yaa khinchne lagate hai
 Questions arise on the image of the Aam Aadmi Party, then suddenly from the next day, photographs of new types of public relations start appearing
 yahi kaam sarkaar or virdohi bhi kar rahe hai
 The minister tweets a photo with such a title while listening to the talk of the people in the Phalane locality
 samasya kya thi or samaadhaan hua yaa nahin yaa koun si nai baat thi jisase jaanane ke liye daftar chhodkar unhen janaa padaa yah sab hamaari jaankaree kaa hissaa nahin he
 Just a photo
 demokrasi ko koreokrasi main badal diya gaya he
 Everything is choreographed
 isiilie kahata hum ki ye demokrasi nahin he
 Now it has become choreocracy
 loktantr ko kisi stadium main sajaa diya gaya he
 Preparations take several days before the leader's arrival
 theme dizine hote hai or uskaa tivi se prasaaran hota he
 Like a single dance India dance
 har pal kii tasviir lee jaati he or twit kiya jaataa he
 From the party to the individual leaders, now they have started to create such a team that transforms their every work into a photo
 netaaon ke yahaan banaai ja rahi soshal media kii timen ab wo kaam kar rahi hai jo shaadi byaah yaa saal ke aakhri dinon main event taiyaar karne vaali companiyaan karti hai
 Whether the padyatra or the address of the people in the stadium is all being decorated in such a way that every frame of it gives a new photo
 swaagat he aapkaa koreokrasi main
 We are all becoming self-conscious citizens
 2012 ke saal ke baad se raajnneeti main photo kaa istemaal badal gaya he
 It has changed so much that now it is becoming difficult to see beyond the photo
 gaur se dekhenge ki aapke raajnneetik chintan ke spes ko photo se bhar diya gaya he
 In the morning, the photo starts coming on Twitter
 kisase mil rahe hai, kya pahan rahe hai or kise kya de rahe hai
 Every meeting is being converted into a photo and is being made a part of propaganda and publicity
 virdohi ke photo kaa mazaaq udaaya jaataa he or apni party ke netaa ke photo kaa prachaar kiya jaataa he
 What happened in that meeting, after that the result is less, but the photo comes
 meraa jivan hi meraa sandesh he
 This statement of Gandhi should be changed today, my photo is my message
 photo ko lekar raajnneetik pratiyogita chal padi he
 Whenever the image of a leader or officer is bad or he gets into controversies, he appears on a photo spot the very next day
 train main safar karne lagata he to kisi garib se milane lagata he
 When someone starts tweeting after meeting a widow, then someone offers a photo of it on the timeline before offering the sheet
 kai baar lagata he ki netaa ek din surakshakarmi chhod do chaar photo vaale ko lekar chalane lagenge
 Moving but the photo has now become the new weapon of democratic political security
 train main baithe hai uskaa photo, train se utar kar kahaan ja rahe hai uskaa photo
 There is a comparison between this photo and that photo on social media
 dekho ve khaali dibbe main akele ja rahe hai, dekho ye bhari hui bogi main sabake saath ja rahe hai
 Notifications are getting shorter
 sawaalon ke jawaab kam mil rahe hai
 Just send photos
 kaam hua iskaa photo nahin he magar kaam karte hue dikhte rahane kaa photo he
 If you question that the work is not being done, then the next day, some leader comes to get the photo taken
 raajnneetik vyakti ko zarur prachaar karnaa chahie or apane kaam ke bare main bataanaa chahie magar kai baar lagata he ki yah ati ho rahaa he
 Is millions of metric photo garbage being generated every day on Twitter and Facebook
 koi chhavi zyada der tak nahin tikti he
 When you are delighted with one photo, another photo comes that you were being unnecessarily happy
 ye photo dekhiye
 See the tweets of any government head or spokesperson
 soochna kam he, photo zyada he
 The Air Force abounds with pictures of goods and people disembarking
 aisa lagata he ki ye saare photo ke liye hi bitha kar laae ja rahe hai
 Not once, such pictures are being tweeted
 yaman se lekar nepal tak ke saraahneey kaam ko photo-karm main badal diya he
 Surely this has changed the perception and also the name of the country, but is image the only information of these efforts
 aap aisi kitni tasviren dekh sakate hai
 It seems that the entire operation is going on in the inner grounds of the giant ships
 aapadaa yaa madad ke aaparishan kitni jaankariyon or sabak se bhare hote hai magar wo sab ab gaayab he
 Lyricist and writer Nilesh Misra found it right that India is proud that India is taking the initiative but the display of pictures of the moment is knocking something out
 madad kii apni ek garima hoti he lekin prachaar kii bhi ek seemaa honi chahie
 If service is our religion, it is also an Indian philosophy to help someone or give something to someone, then don't tell everyone
 sarkaar yaa raajnneetik dal ko ek santulan kaayam karnaa chahie
 Selfless service should not be converted into publicity service
 kai rajya sarkaron ne bhi in maukon ko photo yogya saraahneey kaary main badalane kaa prayaas kiya he
 Why are different state governments jumping when the central government is doing it? nepal se kai log bataa rahe hai ki yahaan madad ke naam aa rahe hai
 Going to take a photo yahi haal swanyasevi sansthaaon kaa bhi ho gaya he
 Every aid is being converted into a number and each number is being added to a thousand
 sankhya is photo yuddh main ek nayaa hathiyaar he
 Every leader has time for selfies and photos
 aam aadmi se pucho to rota milegaa ki phalane netaa ko i-mail bhi kiya, ghar bhi gaye par mulaakaat nahin hui
 The work was not done but the photo of the meeting was tweeted
 tippaniyan a similar competition has taken place in the opposition
 ek formula sa ban gaya he ki ek acha photo kisi ko acha netaa bana saktaa he
 Ideological discourses are being produced less often
 photo sangharsh zyada ho rahaa he
 Rahul Gandhi is on a journey
 ek tarah se photo-yatra par hai
 There is a picture of every moment
 satta paksh photo-paksh ho gai he to virdohi bhi photo-paksh ho gaya he
 The answer to the photo is the photo
 jahaaz se lekar train main bacchon ke saath nazar aa rahe hai
 Just as the Prime Minister stops and takes selfies or starts pulling
 aam aadmi party kii chhavi par sawaal uthte hai to achaanak agle din se nae nae tarah ke jansampark ke photo aane lagate hai
 The government and opponents are doing the same thing
 mantri ji phalane mohalle main logon kii baaten sunate hue is tarah ke sheershak ke saath photo twit hota he
 What was the problem and what was the solution or not or what was the new thing that they had to leave the office to know, all this is not part of our information
 bas ek photo he
 Democracy has been transformed into choreocracy
 har chiz croriographd he
 That is why i say that this is not democracy
 ab ye koreokrasi ho gai he
 Democracy is punished in a stadium
 netaa ke aane se pehle kai dinon kii taiyaari chalati he
 The themes are designed and broadcast on TV
 ek dam dance india dance kii tarah
 Every moment photo is taken and tweeted
 party se lekar vyaktigat netaaon ne ab apane yahaan aisi team banani shuru kar di he jo unke har kaam ko photo main badal de
 The social media teams that are being made here at the leaders are now doing the work that companies do to prepare the event on the wedding or the last days of the year
 padayatra ho yaa stadium main logon kaa sambodhan sab is tarah se sajaayaa ja rahaa he taaki iskaa har frem ek nayaa photo de jaae
 Welcome to choreocracy
 ham sab selfi jaagruk naagarik ban rahe hai
 It will be seen carefully that the space of your political thought has been filled with photos
 subah subah twitor par photo kaa aana chaalu ho jaataa he
 Who are they meeting, what are they wearing and whom are they giving

 sangh ke vichaarak or arthshaastri gurumurti ne aaj tak se kaha he ki do hajaar rupee ke note bhi band ho jaaenge
 Gurumurthy has said that in a few years two thousand notes will be out of circulation
 unka daawa he ki do hajaar ke note sarkaar ne isliye chaape hai, taaki notebandi ke baad arthvyavastha main noton ke gap ko jald se jald bharaa ja sake
 He also said that the government relies more on small notes and that is why big notes will be removed from circulation in the next five years
 unka kahana he ki nikat bhavishya main paanch sau kaa note hi sabase bada note hoga
 This will be followed by two and a half hundred and hundred rupee notes

 Therefore, his statement about the closure of two thousand rupee notes is very important

 Who thought that America would think about India
 agar hamane parmaanu pareekshan nahin kiya hota to ve aapaki taraf dekhte hi nahin
 Gurumurthy said that the way Pokharan changed India in a fundamental way and changed the way people think about it, the same way financial Pokhran will also bring about a fundamental change, but very different thinking to understand, calculate and convince people about it
 Need to be understood
 ullekhneey he ki bharat ne 1998 main pokharan main parmaanu pareekshan kiye the or desh un chuninda deshon main shaamil ho gaya, jinke paas parmaanu hathiyaaron kii kshamta he
 To eliminate the black money being recovered, the government issued 2 thousand notes, now the same 2 thousand rupee notes are being recovered from different places in the form of black money

 Outside the court, Assange told reporters, 'we are happy with the hearing in the court
 website par gopneey dastavejon kaa jari kiye jane kaa silsilaa aage bhi jari rahegaa
 ' ishk, mohabbat, prem, dosti
 All of them are confused today what is their religion? What denomination are they supposed to be? Or which religion people believe them? What to do
 jab mohabbat se bhi uskaa mazahab poocha jane lagegaa to yahi to hoga
 a boy and girl were alone in a room inside a house in Meerut
 donon balig
 Then some people of Hindu Yuva Vahini, an organization formed by UP Chief Minister Adityanath Yogi, enter there
 iske baad shuru hota he ishk ke hindu or musalmaan hone kaa khel
 a game in which a party also becomes the police
 dharm ke thekedaaron kii karatutanam kya he? mazahab kya he? rishta kya he? do alag-alag dharm ke log ek saath ek kamare main kaise baithe hai? kaise baith sakate hai? vaaki desh kii ekta ko isse bada khatra or kya ho saktaa he? kanoon-vyavastha ke liye isse khatarnaak cheez or kya ho sakati he? anekta main ekta or vibhinnata main akhandta vaale bharat desh ke do bhartiya naagarik ek saath ek kamare main nahin baith sakate
 Can not love each other
 kyonki donon hindustani hote hue bhi do alag-alag dharmon ke hai
 And there are contractors of every religion here
 jinaki dukandaaree hi dharm se chalati he
 Then how will he tolerate love
 kyonki do dharmon ke bich hone vaale lav main unhen hameshaa jehad jo dikhaai detaa he
 The police do not remember the IPC, they have shoplifting
 inaki raajnneeti hi aise chamakani he
 But what to do with them? Equipped with the law and sections of law, these policemen know very well what is law and what is illegal
 jurm kise kehete hai auki begunaahi kya hoti he? par kya karen
 Leave the duty to shine in Lucknow, but not even remember the IPC streams
 dabaav main jhootha mukademasamvidhan se lekar ipisi yani bhartiya dand samhita tak ye kahati he ki ek balig ladkaa or ladki agar kisi ghar, ghar ke kamare yaa charadivari ke andar akele hai or donon marji se saath hai to vahaan kanoon kaa danda nahin chal saktaa
 This is a matter of their privacy
 magar itane bade-bade or padhe-padhe apane ipies afasar lakhanu ke aadesh ke aavesh main aakar ye tak bhul jate hai ki ek privet or band kamare main balig ladke-ladki kaa marji se milanaa ashleelata failaane ke daayre main nahin aata
 But still they make a case against the boy in this section
 use adaalat le jate hai or phir jail
 And argues that all this is because the girl's family complained
 ladki ne nahin, he naa kamaal
 In this phase of changing the need to not change clothes, just changing clothes will not work
 hamen apni soch bhi badalani hogi
 The time to come will be for those who love change
 ye hangaamaa, ye virodh hameshaa se hota aayaa he
 But love and friendship cannot be crushed by them
 kareeb dhaai minute ke is mobile video ko hamane aapako dikhaane se pehle saikadon baar suna
 We have not heard that this boy said that he had brought the girl to convert
 jabaki video isi sanghathan ke logon ne banaaya he
 Those who forcefully take off on Gundai
 kya pataa shaayad ye antaryami hai
 These leaders of Hindu Yuva Vahini in Meerut, the contractors of this religion, did not listen to their leader Yogi, who took the contract of Moral Policing
 na police ko ittela di
 Neither the administration had any support
 bas jhund banaakar nikal pade or shastrinagar ilaake main inke hathe chadh gaya ye premi joda
 No need to explain further what happened
 tasviren jhooth nahin bolti
 They say that they were informed that two people are together in a room
 ek ladkaa he, ek ladki he
 One belongs to this religion and one belongs to that religion
 bas itnaa kaaphi tha
 Then what was in the house, the lover couple was dragged to the police station
 ab aapaki jaankaree main izapha kar den ki ye vahi hindu vahini sanghathan he, jisaki shuruuaat mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne gorakhpur main kii thi
 Alam is that now they take the contract of social reform in the whole state
 sabase hairat kii baat ye he ki police to dur kii baat ye khud apane netaa kii nahin sunate
 What will be the difference between the Taliban and Hindustan? It is also true that the organization behind which the Chief Minister is named
 uske khilaaf to police bhi kuch nahin kar sakati
 So when IG Saheb was asked about this, he too went round the answer
 sarkaar par sawaal uthanaa lazimi he
 And now the Chief Minister is under the scanner
 agar kanoon or sarkaar ye tay nahin kar sakati ki log apni marzi se ek duusare se mil sakate hai yaa nahin
 Then who will decide
 kya ab logon se unka dharm puch kar dosti kii jaaegi
 Asking the name, he will be sitting with them
 or kis haisiyat se ye log tay karenge ki kisase milanaa he
 Whom not to meet
 agar aisa hi chalegaa to phir taliban or hindustan main fark kya rah jayega
 When does the love of religion become a frustrated section of society? kyon hota he
 How does it happen
 kahaan hota he
 Nobody knows
 to is par pabandi kaise lagaai jaae
 This confusion of those who consider love to be worthless is also quite valid
 inase ladke ladakiyon kaa sadak, bazaar, cinema haul, mal, restaraan, pub, park main haath main haath daalkar ghoomana bardaasht nahin hota
 So they entered directly into the house
 zaahir he ki ye apane maahaul ke shikaar log hai
 The atmosphere of such people makes them obsessed
 jo khud azaad nahin hai
 They run to cut others' freedom
 aksar bason or texiyon main jo ladkiyaan balaatkaar kii shikaar hoti hai, unke peeche bhi samaaj kaa yahi kunthit varg akhbaaron kii surkhiyaan banataa he
 After UP and Maharashtra, there have been reports of attack on journalist in Jammu and Kashmir

 The victim told that the minister's people had previously made indecent remarks about his wife, which he opposed
 isi baat par mantri kii suraksha main khadey javaanon ne patrkaar ko peetna shuru kar diya
 The journalist says that Minister Lone had only hinted at the guards to beat him

 In view of the lessons learned from the Delhi Assembly elections, the BJP may be hesitant to put forward a face in Bihar, but if the party gets a majority after the election, then there will be many names in the discussion of who can be the Chief Ministerial candidate

 According to separate media reports, more than 2000 people are expected to be killed in this attack of Boko Haram, although this figure has not been officially confirmed by the Government of Nigeria yet

 China will investigate alleged misconduct with an Indian diplomat in one of its courts
 yah baat ek varisht sutara ne enditivi se kahi he
 It is noteworthy that the 46-year-old Indian diplomat s Balachandran fainted after being treated in a Shanghai court due to which he had to be hospitalized
 bharat sarkaar ne is ghatana ko lekar chini adhikariyon ke samaksh kadaa virodh darj karaayaa tha
 Balachandran appeared in a court in Yuvu city near Shanghai on 31 December
 madhumeh ke marij balachandran ko adalati kaarywahi puri hone tak baahar jane kii ijaajat nahin di gai or kuch vakt ke baad vah adaalat main hi behosh hokar gir gaye
 Officials say Balachandran was admitted to a hospital after his condition deteriorated
 bhartiya rajanyik do bhartiya kaarobaariyon ke apharan ke maamle main adaalat main pesh hue the
 Taking the matter seriously, the Indian government lodged a protest with the Chinese authorities in Beijing, Shanghai and Delhi
 dilli main chini duutavas ke up pramukh jhang yue ko videsh mantralay ne talab kiya or unase kaha ki kisi bhi rajanyik ke saath vyavhaar karne kaa yah tarika nahin he
 Official sources say that Zhang was told that Balachandran was a diabetic patient and should have been allowed to eat and move
 videsh mantralay se baahar nikalate samay jhang ne kaha, yah naagarik-vanijyik vivaad he
 We will do our best to settle this matter properly
 maine yahaan ke adhikariyon se is ghatana ke bare main suna
 We are trying to find out the real situation

 There has also been objections from the Indian Embassy in Beijing
 bhartiya rajanyik do bharatiyon ko reeha karaane kaa prayaas kar rahe the, jinhen sthaneey logon ne bandhak banaaya hua tha
 These traders were demanding their dues from Indians in Yiwu
 isse pehle shanghai main vaanijya doot reva ganguli das ne bataaya ki balachandran do bhartiya kaarobaariyon deepak raheja or shyamsundar agarwal ko reeha karaane gaye the or is dauraan unke saath badasluki kii gai
 According to him, the crowd present there punched Raheja and Agarwal and rescued them from Balachandran
 is dauraan balachandran behosh ho gaye
 Local authorities have apologized to Balachandran for the incident
 das ne bataaya ki balachandran kii haalat ab thik he or unke vibhinn test karaae ja rahe hai
 Whenever it seems that people do not care about anything, then a picture comes from somewhere that few people are protesting against something wrong
 afsos ki unki ye ladaai unheen kii ban kar rah jaati he
 By the way, they should be the first, but the government and administration behave as if they are citizens of another country
 iske baad bhi logon ne pradarshan karnaa nahin choda he
 Political parties do not fight the public, the public only fights
 muzaffarpur se ai ek tasviir ummid jagaa detii he ki sab kuch ek samaan nahin he
 On January 22, at twelve thirty, the group of students set foot for Patna
 jahaan ve rajyapal ko bataanaa chaahate the ki basundhara teachers training college ne jo fees badhaai he wo sahi nahin he
 We do not have the college's side but felt that honesty towards the question has strengthened the intention of the padyatra
 9 ghante tak lagaataar chalane ke baad raat ko hajipur rukate hai or vahaan se subah subah patna ke liye ravaanaa hote he
 Had arranged for loudspeaker and food by donating among themselves
 gaadi vaale ne inase kiraaya nahin liya sirf tel ke paise liye
 Was sitting with the tricolor on the car because there is a lot of seriousness about the tricolor in the TV debate
 janata ko lagata he ki agar tirangaa lekar pradarshan karenge to rajyapal, mukhyamantri daude daude aaenge or channel ke ankar vahiin se live karne lagenge
 Sadly, there was an opportunity to reach Patna to reach the Raj Bhavan, but it is not that they are not, had to return without being named
 shaam ko gandhi maidan main dharna dena chaahate the lekin 26 janvari ke naam par waapas kar die gaye
 In October, before the 90 km padyatra, he had staged a fast
 saathiyon kii tabiyat bhi bigadi thi
 a funeral procession was also carried out in protest, but nothing happened
 june 2018 main patna hoicourt kaa aadesh aayaa ki bied college kii fees bad sakati he
 Students say that according to UGC rules, fees cannot be increased in the middle session
 hoicourt ke faisle main bhi alag-alag sharten thim magar uske naam par kai privet collejon main ek hi baar main dedh lakh fees kar di gai
 The students say that they do not have the financial capacity to pay the increased fees and the way to increase is wrong, so they are demonstrating
 ye saare chaatr patna main hamaare sahyogi manish kumaar ke paas gaye or apni vyathaa bataai
 In Bihar, there were several demonstrations in the past on the fees of b
ed
 patna main hi nahin balki gaanvon or kasbon main bhi
 Students say that if one finds out the status of teachers in these b
ed institutions, then it will be understood that their protest is justified
 yaheen par ek baat kahana chahta hum ki mujhe har din saikadon log sampark karte hai
 i have said many times that i cannot show everyone's dharna, they do not have the same resources and neither is possible
 jo dikhaa rahaa hum wo kisi ek ke liye nahin balki sabake liye he
 It shows what is the condition of administration and government
 muzaffarpur se nikal kar aaiye chalate hai muzaffarnagar ke paas shamali he
 Here farmers were promised that sugarcane payment would start within 14 days
 magar shamali mil ko ganna dene vaale kisaanon kaa 200 karod se adhik kaa bakaayaa ho gaya he
 There is a balance of Rs 83 crore for the November to May season of 2017
 2018 ke november se shuru hue sijan kaa abhi tak koi pement nahin hua he jabaki dhai maheene se adhik kaa samay guzarane ja rahaa he
 This season also owes about 150 crores
 yahaan par 50 se adhik gaanvon ke kisaan dharna de rahe hai
 The farmers have done everything but the payment has not been made
 sangharsh ke liye aapas main chanda hua he or khaanaa pani yaheen ban rahaa he
 Here the farmers gathering outside Shamli sugar mill is quite big
 hajaaron kisaan hone ke kaaran netaa log yaheen aakar bhaashan de rahe hai
 Suresh Rana is the sugarcane minister from the same district, but the farmers have to agitate for the payment of sugarcane
 yahaan bhi kisaanon ne chanda kiya hua he or bhojan pani yaheen ho rahaa he
 Farmers say that if the money is not received on time, then they do not pay the fees of the children
 fees nahin dene ke kaaran skool main teacher unhen class ke baahar khadey kar dete hai
 Not only this, the government's plan is that by giving electricity bills for a fixed time, the surcharge will be forgiven but due to lack of money, they are not able to take advantage of the scheme, so they are incurring double losses
 ziladhikari ne zarur kisaanon se baat kii he or mil ke khilaaf exiaar kii he magar paisa nahin mil rahaa he
 For this, one day Hindu and Muslim farmers together also prayed the prayer of the Jana
 sar mundaaya or maun rah kar pradarshan kiya
 What farmers are not doing for their money
 namaaz padhane se lekar sar mundane tak
 Actually when you move towards a performance the path becomes longer
 bahut kam pradarshan hote hai jinka nateeja nikalataa he
 They also end with assurances but begin after a short time
 bharat main ek demokrasi index hona chahie jisase rose pataa chale ki aaj kin kin maangon ko lekar kahaan kahaan pradarshan hue
 Many demonstrations were carried out with sticks and how many memoranda were taken, some got assurance and some got results
 isse pataa chalegaa ki hamaari loktantric sarkarein janata ko kitna mahatv detii hai
 You know that the implementation of reservation of Scheduled Castes, Tribes and obcs in universities has become impossible due to the implementation of the 13 point roster system
 is mudde ko samajhane vaale kah rahe hai ki collejon or uniwarsity main aarakshan kii vyavastha samaapt ho gai he
 Adhak teachers of Delhi University protested about it
 kareeb ek saal se collejon main niyuktiyaan kareeb kareeb thapp hai
 Neither the general got a job and the reserve
 ujisi ke circular or supreme court ke aadesh ke kaaran sthiti or mushkil ho gai he
 Students of Scheduled Castes and Tribes, OBC, say that reservation will never apply due to the new order as 10 or 13 posts will never come together in any one department
 pehle uniwarsity main sabhi khaali padon ko jod kar uskaa 49
 5 percent was reserved
 lekin ab vibhaag ko unit maanane se aisa nahin ho sakegaa
 There is uneasiness in many colleges and universities across the country
 dilli vishvavidhyalay ke adahak shikshakon ne kaha he ki 25 janvari ko bhi pradarshan karenge
 Thereafter they will also perform on 28 January
 agar sarkaar ne adhyadesh laakar 200 flint roster yani puraani vyavastha lagu nahin kii gai to pradarshnon kaa silsilaa jari rahegaa
 The already existing reservation system in the country's universities has come to a standstill
 bharat main hi ho saktaa he ki uniwarsity main ek saal se koi bahaali na ho rahi ho or kisi ko fark na padataa ho
 But it is not that the performances are not happening
 log awaz nahin uthaa rahe hai
 Rather the reverse is happening
 awaz to uth rahi he, suni nahin ja rahi he
 Piyush Goyal's statement was published on Live Mint of 2 October 2017 and on several media websites that he will generate 1 million jobs in the railway system within a year
 rail mantri ne dilli main hue india iconomik summit main kaha tha
 According to Live Mint, he had said that only 2 lakh jobs could be created in the area of track renewal and safety
 is baat ke dedh saal se adhik ho chuke hai, rail mantri bataa den ki trek ke navinikaran or sangraksha main 2 lakh logon ko rojgaar diya he yaa nahin
 Goyal, who has spoken of creating one million jobs in 12 months, has not yet completed one lakh restoration process in two years
 aaj tak pataa nahin chalaa ki das lakh naukari dene vaale us bayaan kaa kya hua
 At least we would give the accounts by demanding from the contractors of the railway, how many and what level of employees are employed here
 paanch minute kaa kaam tha
 Every few months a statement about jobs comes
 ek baar to railway main antipisi snaatak kii pariksha hui
 More than 18 thousand posts were released but after the result, four thousand posts were reduced
 27 disambar 2017 ko loksabhaa main mohammad saleem ke sawaal ke jawaab main bataate hai ki railway main sabhi prakaar ke 2 lakh 22 hazaar 159 pad khaali hai
 Of these, 41,128 posts of scheduled castes and tribes are vacant
 kya railway ne april 2017 ke hisaab se 2 lakh 22 hazaar vekency nikaali
 Did not remove rail mantri se puuchhie ki 2014 se 2018 ke bich har saal ritair hone waalon kii jagah kitne logon ko naukari di gai he
 Simple question but will not get answer
 pichley saal farvari main railway ne 1 lakh 27 hazaar se adhik kii vaikency nikaali
 The Railway Minister himself is saying that it will take two and a half months to complete the process, ie by march-april, the results will come
 ek saal se adhik samay lagata he ek lakh 20 hazaar kii bahaali kii prakriya puri hone main
 That too is the pressure of elections, then there is so much speed
 kya vaaki sari prakriya puri kar lee jaaegi, matlab rigelt aa jayega, dastavejon kii jaanch ho jaaegi, medical ho jayega or jwining ho jaaegi
 This has not happened for a long time, if it happens, what good it is
 abhi rail mantri phir se 1 lakh 32 hazaar kii vaikency nikaalane kii baat kar rahe hai
 Under no circumstances will the process be completed before the end of 2019
 2020 ke march tak bhi ho jaae to ganimat samajhie
 If there is an election, it is announced
 balki elaan he kyonki chunaav he
 Piyush Goyal says that one lakh more will retire in the next two years
 kya ve ritair hone se pehle hi vigyaapan nikaalane ja rahe hai or bahaali kii prakriya puri karenge
 According to the Railway Minister, if 40 to 50 thousand retirees every year, can they tell how many people have been replaced by the Railways in 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017 and 2018
 rail karmchaaree sangh ke shiv prakaash ke mutabik do saal baad junior ejeeniyar kii bahaali ai he
 Advertisement has come for 13,487 posts
 kya chunaav he isliye junior ejeeniyar kii bahaali ai he
 There is one more angle
 railmantri yah nahin bataa rahe hai ki kitne nae rojgaar paidaa honge
 Will recruit people who retire, but this is an automatic process
 isamen nai baat kya he
 Should they not tell that their decisions have led to new jobs
 ab is hisaab ko dhyaan se dekhie
 The Railway Minister said that the Railways provides employment to 12 lakh people
 2017 ke bajet paper kaa anexture palat kar dekhiegaa
 There is no change in the target of manpower of the railway between 2015 and 2018
 2015 main 13,26,437 mainpavar kaa target tha jo 2018 main 13,31,433 ho gaya
 That is, there was no change in the manpower of the railway in three years
 ye bajet ke anexture main he or 2 march 2017 ke times of india main is par pradeep thakur ne report bhi kii thi
 Now you see the report of the Seventh Pay Commission, in it you will get the number of sanctioned posts of Central Government and the number of vacant posts
 iske anusaar 1 janvari 2014 ko railway main manzur padon kii sankhya 15 lakh 57 hazaar thi
 But Manpower was 13 lakh 61 thousand at that time
 tab railway ke paas do lakh se adhik bhartee kaa mauka tha jo nahin kiya
 Now according to the Railway Minister, it has come down from 13 lakh to 12 lakh
 to kya railway ne ek lakh se adhik naukariyaan phir gata deen
 If you look at the number of posts sanctioned as on 1 January 2014, the Railways has reduced more than three lakh posts
 rail mantri ritair hone vaale kii jagah bahaali kii baat kar rahe hai
 They are not giving the account of creating new jobs
 abhi aapane suna ki aktubar 2017 main rail mantri kitni sahajata se bataa rahe hai ki railway main jo nivesh hota he uskaa 20 pratishat bhi lebar cast hoga to aaraam se das lakh logon ko kaam mil jaataa he
 Do you know or has the railway minister told you what is the condition of the people working on the contract in the railway, what is the condition of them
 haal hi main sieji kii is par report ai he
 Siji has studied the staff position of those contractors who have been paid Rs 35,098 crore by the Railways between 2014 and 2017
 theke par kaam karne vaali 463 companiyon kaa adhyayan kar sieji ne bataaya he ki mazaduron ke shoshan ko rokane ke liye bane kanoon kaa 50 percent bhi lagu nahin hota he
 Should get holiday money, but neither holiday nor holiday money
 thekedaaron ne mazaduron ke kai sau karod rupee pachaa liye
 According to the rule, the money was to be paid by check but kept giving cash
 212 kantrector ke yahaan ricard hi nahin mila ki paisa kaise diya jaataa he
 Not only this, money from provident fund is not deducted
 rail, shram, bhavishya nidhi sanghathan kisi kaa adhikari jaanch karne nahin jaataa he
 Overall, the companies to which the Railways give thousands of crores of rupees to do their work, there is neither full salary nor facility according to the rules
 vahaan bhi kaam karne kii behatar sthiti nahin he
 It is written in the CAG report
 aapane naukari series main dekha ki kis tarah ek ek pariksha kaa farm bharne main hi karodon rupee aayogon ke paas aa jate hai
 Even if that exam is not completed, the money comes

 The Punjab government has given the opportunity to attack the opposition by removing 23 lessons of Sikh history from the 12th class history text book
 hataae gaye paath main sikh guru or yoddhaon kaa itihaas, angrej or sikhon ke bich hue yuddh, baba banda singh bahadur or maharaja ranjit singh sahit sikh or mughalon ke bich hue sangharsh ke paath shaamil hai
 The opposition has attacked the government and said that it is not right to remove 23 texts out of the history text book in Punjab
 vipakshi party akali dal ne is mudde par jaanch kii maang kii he or hataae gaye paath turant paathya pustak main dobaaraa shaamil karne kii maang kii he
 Former Education Minister Daljit Singh Cheema said that he is not averse to teaching Indian history in the Class XII history textbook but if the students do not read the history of Punjab then how will he know about the sacrifices given by the Guru and warriors of Punjab? Akali Apart from the party, the Punjab government is also targeted by the main opposition party Aam Aadmi Party
 vipaksh ke netaa sukhpal singh khera ne kaha he ki paathya pustak se punjab ke itihaas se jude 23 paath hataane kaa faisla naa keval yuvaaon ko andhere main rakhega balki unako bhramit bhi karegaa
 The government should correct its mistake by adding the deleted text to the book again
 udhar akali dal ke hamale se aahat mukhyamantri captain amarinder singh ne kaha he ki akali dal bevajaah maamle ko oochaal rahaa he kyonki barahavin kaksha ke paathyakram or 11veen kaksha ke paathyakram main thode badlaav kiye gaye hai
 Lessons removed from class 12th are being added to the lower class
 yah kitaab philhal press main he or sikh itihaas ke paath hataane kaa sawaal hi paidaa nahin hota
 On the other hand, when it was talked to Education Minister OP Soni, he expressed ignorance about the matter and said that if there is any problem in the text book then it will be rectified soon
 shiksha vibhaag ne ekamusth 23 paath hataakar vipaksh ko baithe-bithaae ek bada mudda thama diya he
 The Opposition is capitalizing on it and the government is in the dock
 is faisle ko raajnneetik or dharmik rang bhi diya ja rahaa he, kyonki maamlasikh dharm guruonse judaa he isliye sarkaar nishane par he
 In the past, the case of brutally beating four Dalit youth by self-proclaimed cow protection group in Gujarat is not the only case
 vastav main is saal april tak gujarat main dalit utpeedan ke 409 maamle darj hue hai
 However, the incident that took place at Una in Saurashtra on July 11 with four Dalit youth sparked a debate on Dalit oppression at the national level, prompting the police to attack six similar Dalit youths who attacked nine Dalit youths in Rajula town of Amreli district in May
 The defenders' had to be taken into custody
 kendriya aparaadh record beuro ke anusaar, gujarat main 2001 se ab tak dalit utpeedan ke 14,500 maamle saamne aae hai

 On the afternoon of 22 May in Rajula, a team of similar cow guards entered the Dalit colony riding on big vehicles and bikes

 Premabhai Rathod was also hit on the head
 una ke samadhiyaala kii hi tarah go rakshakon ne apane atyaacharon kaa nirlypt bhav se video banaaya tha
 But with Rathore, others complained to the police, the police refused to accept the video

 Rathore told that when they went to complain, the police had said, 'you think you will bring any such stupid video and we will believe it?' police ne puure ek din ke baad is maamle kii shikaayat darj kii thi, vah bhi sirf 19 logon ke khilaaf jabaki ghatana main isse kahin adhik log sanlipt the
 However, no action was taken even after the complaint was filed

 Rathore says, "we had no hope that the police would do anything in it
" police ke saamne hamen phir se jaleel hona padaa
 After this, Dalit activists led by Babaria took out a 70 km long motorcycle rally from Amreli to Rajula on 7 July and demanded action
 babariyaa ne kaha, 'uske baad 11 july ko samadhiyaala main ghatana ghati or police dar gai
 Taking immediate action, they arrested six people

 ) According to the Central Crime Records Bureau, there have been 14,500 cases of Dalit oppression in Gujarat since 2001
 is aadhaar par dekha jaae to gujarat main har saal dalit utpeedan kii 1000 ghatnaayen, jabaki pratidin ke hisaab se teen ghatnaayen pratidin ghatin
 Activists working for Dalit rights say that the rate of action in such cases is three to five per cent, which causes the convicts to escape action and hence such incidents are increasing
 rajula main 22 may kii dopaher isi tarah kaa go rakshakon kaa ek dal badi gadiyon or bike par savaar ho dalit basti main ghus aayaa tha
 Like the Una incident, these so-called cow guards also brought sticks and knives
 kuch ke paas to talavaarein bhi thim
 Dalit activist Rameshbhai Babaria, who works in the area, said that the cow guards had broken the hands and feet of the Dalits and beat them up badly
 premabhai rathod ke bhi sir par waar kiya gaya tha
 Like Una's Samadhiyala, the Go Rakshakas made a video of their atrocities with an unkind attitude
 lekin rathod ke saath anya logon ne police main isaki shikaayat kii to police ne vah video sweekaar karne se inkaar kar diya tha
 The most important thing is that the Dalit community does not remove the skin of the dead animals, but the livestock and for this the local body has provided them a place
 rathod ne bataaya ki jab ve shikaayat karne gaye to police ne kaha tha, 'tumhe lagata he ki tum is tarah kaa koi bhi behuda video laaoge or ham us par vishwaas kar lenge?' The police had filed a complaint in this case after a full day, that too against only 19 people, while more people were involved in the incident
 haalanki shikaayat darj hone ke baad bhi koi karrwai nahin kii gai
 Social workers and villagers again went to the police on 31 May
 rathod bataate hai, 'hamen koi ummid nahin thi ki police isamen kuch karegi
 We had to be jalil again in front of the police
 ' iske baad babariyaa ke netritv main dalit kaaryakartaaon ne saat july ko amarelli se rajula ke bich 70 kilometre lambii motorcycle raily nikaali or karrwai kii maang kii
 Babriya said, 'after that on July 11, the incident took place in Samadhiyala and the police got scared
 unhone tatkaal karrwai karte hue chah logon ko giraftaar kar liya
 Earlier they kept telling us that all are absconding and they have not been able to find anyone
 ' unhone aage kaha, 'aaropee to bahut se or hai
 But at least he caught six, right late
 ' Meanwhile, the Crime Investigation Department (crime Branch) has submitted a summary report to the Gujarat High Court in the case of three Dalit youths killed in police firing in Surendranagar in 2012, stating that no crime was found against anyone
 ullekhneey he ki police ne eke-47 se goliyaan chalaai thim
 Jignesh Mevani, a Dalit activist and a lawyer by profession, said, 'charge sheet has to be filed within 60 days in case of any atrocities
 lekin is maamle main chaar saal ho chuke hai or ab bhi aarope-patr daakhil nahin kiya gaya he
 Three of the arrested policemen have been granted bail and one police officer is absconding for four years
 kai shikayaton ke baad gujarat sarkaar ne pradhan sachiv sanjay prasad se maamle kii jaanch ke liye kaha
 But his report submitted in 2013 was not made public
 tippaniyan Under the Right to Information Act, when Kirti Rathod asked why the report was not made public, it was said that 'it will harm the sovereignty and integrity of the country and spread hatred in the society'

 As the education department of Uttar Pradesh is becoming famous with the announcements, an action plan has been made to curb the fees of private schools, so now the plan to convert government schools into English medium can be carried out on the lines of private schools
 upi sarkaar pradesh main garib or gramin bacchon ko shahari public skool ke bacchon kii tarah smart banane kii kaaryayojna par kaam kar rahi he isiilie shiksha vyavastha ko sudhaarney ke liye or garib bacchon ko angreji madhyam se padhai karaane ke liye 5000 angreji madhyam ke skool kholane kii taiyaari kar rahi he
 For this, the government has given the responsibility of selecting five government schools at every block level to the Basic Education Department
 chune gaye gaye 5 skulon main angreji madhyam se padhai karai jaaegi iske liye shikshakon ko bhi prashikshan diya jayega jisamen prashikshit shikshak nideshaalay par alag-alag samay par aakar prashikshan praapt karenge
 English medium schools can be studied like private convents, which will help poor children to study in English medium
 yogi sarkaar kaa maananaa he ki padhai main to gaanv, dehaat or kasbon ke bachche shahari bacchon se aage yaa baraabar jarur hote hai lekin angreji naa bol paanaa yaa angreji madhyam main padhai kaa naa hona sabase badi baadha hoti or unke karier ko pankh nahin laga paata
 This thinking of the Yogi government is not only making headlines but is also getting praise because it is only Uttar Pradesh which has been politically witness to opposition to English

 we still have taboos on just the words sex and condoms
 
 
 but not the actual act
 Let’s talk more
 
 
 read more and learn more about all the things that can be avoided just by the use of a simple precaution
 With condoms you can have planned pregnancies and protected sex
 
 
 which can curb HIV and STD cases
 As a couple we believe in this that’s why we have thoughtfully endorsed it

 ke
 Stalind has become the unopposed chairman of the DMK
 aise main stallin ke saamne chunauti pesh karne vaale bade bhai emklagiribhi unke saath kaam karne ko taiyaar ho gaye hai
 In this way, if he returns to the DMK, then there can be a big change in Tamil Nadu politics
 bataa den ki alaagiri nekarunanidhike nidhan ke sirf ek hafte baad hi stallin ko diemke kaa jimmaa saunpe jane par sawaal khadey karte hue morcha khol diya tha
 From Marina Beach, Karunanidhi's tombstone, he had said that DMK workers were with him
 stallin bhale hi kaaryakari adhyaksh hai, lekin kaam nahin karte or wo party ko jitaane kii kshamta nahin rakhte
 Stalin succeeded in becoming DMK President amid Alagiri's challenge
 ab algiri kii party main vaapasi karnaa chaahate hai
 Not only this, they are also ready to work under the leadership of Stalin
 aise main party main unki vaapasi kaa faisla stallin ke haathon main he
 Stalin is the second leader in the dmk's history to hold the post of party president
 jabaki isse pehle karunanidhi 49 saal tak party ke adhyaksh rahe the
 Karunanidhi had to deal with the conflict between his successor Stalin and son Alagiri during his lifetime
 1980 main donon bhaaiyon ke bich badhati daraar ko kam karne ke liye karunanidhi ne alaagiri ko dakshin tamilnadu main party kii kaman sanbhaalane ke liye bhej diya tha
 Even then, the war of political supremacy between the two brothers did not stop
 iske baad karunanidhi ne stallin ke virodh ke chalate 2014 main alaagiri ko diemke se nishkasit kar diya tha
 After Karunanidhi's death, Alagiri stood as the biggest challenge against Stalin, but he could not succeed
 alaagiri ne 5 sitambar ko ek badi raily bulaai he, lekin ab ve diemke main phir se vaapasi karnaa chaahate hai
 Actually except for 1984 and 2016, there has been a pattern of change of power in Tamil Nadu
 har baar tamilnadu kii janata satta par kaabiz party ko baahar kar detii he
 The power is constantly changing between the DMK and AIADAK
 lekin is baar sthitiyaan badal gai hai
 The original AIADK voters have the option to choose between the actual AIADMK and the TTV Dinakaran-led AIADMK
 aise main diemke ko karunanidhi ke nidhan ke chalate sahanubhuti kaa raajnneetik phayda mil saktaa he

 BCCI treasurer Chaudhary asked for reasons for approving dearness allowance of $ 4,050 for Karim for a nine-day period and asked for documents related to the visit
 kareem kaa har din kaa mahangaai bhatta (kareeb) 30,000 rupee he, jisamen hotel kaa kiraaya shaamil nahin he
 The Treasurer, in an e-mail sent to the Committee of Administrators, compared it to earlier cases and said how the administrators had stopped the Secretary's visit to the UK during the T20 series and said that there would be no benefit from his visit
 ICC T-20 ranking: rahul top teen main shaamil, finch ne rachaa itihaasaunhone likhaa, ‘mujhe ek i-mail mila he, jisamen thomas cook (travel company) ko bheje jane vaale ek patr par hastakshar karne ko kaha gaya he taaki saiyad sabaa kareem kii nau din kii prastaavit britain yatra ke liye mahangaai bhatte ke rup main 4,050 dollar ke baraabar kii raashi jari kii ja sake
 The treasurer said that he would sign it, but he wanted to ask (COA members) Vinod Rai and Diana Edulji four questions
 unhone kaha, ‘pehla sawaal manjuuri dene se pehle unki (kareem) britain yatra kaa makasad or usase judi faisle lene kii prakriya or isibi (england evam wales cricket board) se nimantran yaa isibi ke saath koi patrachaar ko dikhaane vaale dastavej se judaa he
 Chaudhary said, 'the second question is whether the relevant documents show that approval has been given
 teesraa mudda us soochna se judaa he ki kya haal main koi doosraa karmchaaree britain gaya he
 "he said," The last question that if there is a possibility that such a visit happened recently, could not the employee do the work for which Karim would go there now? "chaudhary said
 Under the instructions there is a 'ban' from questioning him, but he wants to know this for his general curiosity
 ’T-20: do saal se 3 maichon kii siries main ajey he bharat, score rahaa 8-0unhone kaha, ‘mujhe is mudde par aapse baat karne main kuch sankoch ho rahaa he, kyonki main saamaanya rup main karmchaaree se or vivaran maangata tathaa vivaran, manjuuri evam bill ko lekar khud ko santusht karne ke sambandh main sioe ke sadasyon ko pareshaan nahin karnaa chahta kyonki kabhi kabhi ek maheene main 3,000 se zyada bhugtan hue hai, jinaki mujhe saamaanya rup se jaanch kerani chahie
 The treasurer said, "but your instructions prevent me from asking for any details / bills etc
 from the employee and it is necessary for me to ask for such details only from the COA as per your instructions
 isliye main yah email likh rahaa hum
 He said that he wanted to know the motive for Karim's visit, as Acting Secretary Amitabh Chaudhary was recently barred from doing so
 choudhary ne us i-mail kaa sandarbh diya jisamen kaaryvahak sachiv ke daure ko lekar sioe ne kaha tha ki isse bisisiai ko koi phayda nahin hoga
 He said, 'so although i do not know why Karim is being sent on a nine-day tour, no papers, documents or letters were sent to me other than the letter sent to me seeking his signature which would have pacified my curiosity
 ’koshadhyaksh ne yah bhi kaha ki vah spashtikaran chaahate hai, kyonki bisisiai ke liye videshi vinimay prabandhan kanoon (femaa) ke tahat banaae gaye niyamon kaa paalan karnaa jaruri he

 There is a possibility of reconciliation between uncle's nephew
 shivpal ne mulaayam ke kehane par pahal kii he or saare gile shikave bhulaakar akhilesh se dosti kaa haath badhaayaa he
 If sources are to be believed, on Tuesday evening, the issue was discussed between Mulayam Singh Yadav and Shivpal Yadav

 Shivpal took the initiative to put an end to the ongoing feud in the Samajwadi Party, even though the ice between the relationship between uncle and nephew is definitely melting
 bataa den ki chachaa-bhattije ke bich is saal janvari main vivaad itnaa bad gaya tha, ki akhilesh yadav ne party main baghawat kaa jhanda buland kar diya tha or apane pita mulaayam singh yadav ko hataakar khud rashtriya adhyaksh ban gaye the
 While Akhilesh joined senior party leaders including Ram Gopal Yadav, Shivpal got Mulayam

 Despite this, he did not take the name of bowing
 jabaki shivpal lagaataar kehete rahe ki party kii kaman mulaayam singh yadav ko di jaae
 But Akhilesh did not accept one
 iske baad shivpal ne nai party banane kii baat kahana shuru kiya
 Recently a new party was about to be announced, but Mulayam at the last moment turned back on Shivpal's wishes and refused to form a new party
 iske baad shivpal party main puri tarah alag thalag pad gaye
 As for the reconciliation between uncle and nephew, you can tell that according to Samajwadi Party sources, there will be reconciliation between uncle and nephew by Wednesday afternoon

 It is known that Shivpal is now adamant that his three close associates of Akhilesh be brought back to the party
 iske alaava shivpal khud ke liye ab rashtriya mahasachiv kaa pad chaahate hai, jis par netaji bhi sahamat hai
 However, Shivpal Yadav's biggest obstacle in national politics is Ram Gopal Yadav

 He traveled almost all over India and spent most of his life in the northern part of the country

 He is considered to be superior in Indian religion philosophy
 unhone anek granth likhe hai, lekin unka darshan vishesh rup se unke teen bhashyon main jo - upanishad, brahmasutra or gita par hai, pramukh he
 Other Acharyas on Bhagavad Gita and Brahmasutra are also commentaries, but the Upanishads do not have a coordinated commentary like that of Shankaracharya

 People from other religions and sects were also invited to discuss

 He tried to revive the principles of ancient Indian Upanishads
 unhone ishwar ko purna vaastaviktaa ke rup main sweekaar kiya or saath hi is sansar ko bhram yaa maaya bataaya
 According to him, ignorant people do not consider God as real and consider the world as real

 advait vedant darshan par bhi unhone 23 kitaaben likhin
 Considered to be an incarnation of Lord Shiva, Shankaracharya lived for only 32 years
 unke bare main kai preranadayak kahaniyaan prachlit hai
