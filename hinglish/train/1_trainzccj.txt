 This is the first time in the last fourteen years that the average of this star batsman has reached such a low level

 Salman Khan has been sentenced to 5 years in the famous black deer hunting case
 unako jail bhej diya gaya he
 According to reports, the film industry may suffer crores due to their going to jail
 reports ke mutabik salmaan se jude bollywood ke tamaam projects par kareeb 1000 karod rupee daanv par lage hai
 Even though Salman has been punished, it is unlikely that it will affect his projects
 philhal salmaan 'res 3' kii shutig kar rahe the or isi saal 'bharat' kii shooting bhi shuru karne vaale the
 However, there is hope that he will get bail soon
 unke paas abhi bachane ke kanoonee vikalp hai
 In such a situation, he will complete his project, but his punishment will stain his image
 is kaaran ho saktaa he in filmon ko darshakon kaa acha rispons na mili
 This has already happened with Salman
 20 saal baad bhi nahin badale salmaan, thane ke baad jail main bhi baithne kaa andaaj puranasalaman ne 1998 main rajshri production kii film 'ham saath-saath hai' kii shooting ke dauraan jodhpur main kaala hiran or chinkaara kaa shikaar kiya tha
 After getting caught in this case, many of his films were released, which did not do very well
 yahaan tak ki 'ham saath-saath hai' ne bhi box-offis par ausat bijness kiya tha
 Despite the long star cast and good storyline, the film was rejected by the audience
 agar dekhen to ek khaas darshak varg ko focus kar film banane vaale rajshri production kii filmein blockbster rahi hai, lekin 'ham saath-saath hai' ke saath aisa nahin hua tha
 Salman's case was believed to have a negative impact on his business
 1998 main salmaan kii film 'bandhan' ai thi
 The film was released during the time when Salman was caught in the case
 film main unke saath jaiki shroff the
 In the film, Salman was in the role of a brother who listens to his sister and brother-in-law with his eyes closed
 aisi kahani ke baavjood ye film acha bijness karne main safal nahin rahi thi
 In April 1999, her film 'janam Likha Karo' opposite Urmila Matondkar came out
 ye film flop sabit hui thi
 Perhaps this also had an impact on the environment against Salman in the deer hunting case
 us dauraan aasapaas relies hui filmon par iskaa asar padaa
 However, Salman later made a comeback at the box office
 salmaan kii sajaa par bhi chaa gaye taimur, jaane kya he conection?aaie bataate hai salmaan kii kin bade projects par lage hai kareeb hajaar karod ke daanv
 
 
 The box-office has so far had high expectations from Race 3, being built in a budget of around Rs 120 crore
 acchhee star-cast or ection se bharpoor is film kaa superhit hona tay mana ja rahaa tha, lekin is faisle kaa film ke collection par asar pad saktaa he
 bharatsalman's Bharat will be a Hindi remake of the Korean film Odd to My Father
 iskaa bajet lagbhag 210 karod rupee bataaya jai rahaa he
 Ali Abbas Zafar is producing this film
 unke saath salmaan pehle sultan or tiger jinda he bana chuke hai
 The shooting of this film of Salman is to begin in June
 isaki shooting punjab, mumbai, dilli or abudhabi main honi he
 Kamya spoke on punishment to Salman - Celebsbig Boss 12, who came in support of blind law, Salman's name is still fixed for next season of 'bigg Boss'
 yah sijan oktober main shuru hoga
 Please tell that Salman Khan charges around 11 crores for this show
 har saal is sho ko acchhee tiarapy milti he, lekin is saal is par bura asar pad saktaa he

 2 with Railways GE
 6 arab dollars (kareeb 17,102 karod rupee) kaa kantract kiya tha

 RJD mlas were demanding there to make him the chief minister at the earliest
 tippaniyan Surely, at present, the Janata Dal United are describing all these issues as the result of 'tablattar oil massage' among the RJD mlas, but they also accept with suppressed language that the RJD MLA without the help of Lalu Yadav does not dare to criticize the government

 Even after the Bangladesh match, Team India has been criticized on some aspects, but this match has brought some positives for Team India
 khud dhoni bhi dabaav main apane yuvaaon ke is pradarshan ko bada plus maan rahe hai
 What have they been for Team India plus points, let's know
 
 
 captain kool kii shandaar captaini or wicketcaping ve ahm vajah jiske chalate team india jiti
 Dhoni did 2 stumpings and scored a crucial run out, keeping his patience at the end
 khud dhoni ne apni captaini or shant dimag par sawaal puche jane par kaha ki mujhe lagata he sabase phydemand yah sabit hota he ki aap sabaki suno or vah karo, jo aapako sahi lagata he
 If i feel i should do something, i like to go with it
 haa, aise halaat main ek khule dimag ke saath rahanaa madadgaar hota he
 Many times, you think within a circle under pressure and here the suggestion of others is helpful, but you have to assess all the suggestions and the time for that is very less
 match se doosraa plus point rahaa jasprit bumraah, jinhone itane dabaav main unke khud ke liye kharaab din hone ke baavjood shandaar vaapasi kar team ko jeet kii ummid di
 He gave a total of 13 runs in the 17th and 19th overs, allowing Team India to return to the match
 unhone sabhi gend yorker phenki
 On Bumrah, Mahendra Singh Dhoni said that if you look at his international career, this is the first match in which he was under pressure
 yah sirf gendbaaji kaa dabaav nahin, main unhen fielding ke maamle main thodaa kamazor maanata hum
 The match against Bangladesh was very important
 ham sab ye jaanate the or shuruyaat main aapse pehali hi gend par misfield ho jaae to kaaphi dabaav hota he, jo unki gendbaaji main bhi dikhaa
 Then he also dropped the catch
 aise samay main unhen bataanaa jaruri tha ki jo hua so hua, us par sochane se ab ballebaaj out nahin ho jayega or uske baad unhone joardaar vaapasi kii
 The third positive is Hardik Pandya
 unhen jo role diya gaya use unhone bakhubi nibhaane kii koshish kii
 
 ek bada dil dikhaaya, jimmedaari lene ke liye taiyaar dikhe
 The comments dhoni ne pandya par kaha ki mujhe lagata he ki yah unke liye ek bahut acha match rahaa
 The reason for this was that he had to bowl under pressure
 acchhee baat yah he ki wo ye karnaa chaahate the or apane plan ke saath taiyaar the
 i think it's good for him and the team
 ab ummid yahi ki is dabaav bhare match main is tarah ke pradarshan ke baad team in posytius ke saath aage shandaar pradarshan karegi
 Captain Cool's superb captaincy and wicketkeeping were the key reasons why Team India won
 dhoni ne 2 stamping kii or ant main apana dhairya barkaraar rakhte hue ek ahm ran out kiya
 Asked questions on his captaincy and calm mind, Dhoni himself said that i think it is most beneficial that you listen and do what you think is right
 agar mujhe lagata he ki kuch karnaa chahie to main uske saath janaa pasand karata hum
 Yes, it is helpful to live with an open mind in such situations
 kai baar aap dabaav main ek daayre ke andar hi sochate hai or yahaan par dusron kaa suzav madadgaar hota he, lekin aapako sab sujhaavon kaa akalan karnaa hota he or uske liye samay bahut kam hota he
 The second plus point from the match was Jasprit Bumrah, who made a spectacular comeback despite his own bad days under so much pressure and gave the team hope of victory
 17wein or 19wein over main unhone kul 13 ran die, jisase team india match main vaapasi kar saki
 He bowled all the yorkers
 bumraah par mahendra singh dhoni ne kaha ki agar aap unka antarrashtriya kariyar dekhen to yah pehla aisa match he, jisamen un par dabaav tha
 It is not just the bowling pressure, i consider him a little weak in the field of fielding
 bangladesh ke khilaaf match kaaphi ahm tha
 We all knew this and in the beginning if you get misfired on the very first ball, then there is a lot of pressure, which also shows in their bowling
 phir unhone kaich bhi chhod diya
 At such a time, it was necessary to tell them that thinking about what happened, the batsman will not be out now and after that he made a strong comeback
 teesraa positive he hardik pandya
 He tried to play the role he was given
 
 Shown a big heart, ready to take responsibility
 tippaniyan Dhoni said on Pandya that i think it was a very good match for him
 uski vajah yah ki unhen dabaav main gendbaaji kerani thi
 The good thing is that he wanted to do this and was ready with his plan
 mujhe lagata he ye unke liye or team ke liye acha he
 Now it is expected that after such performance in this pressure-filled match, the team will perform well with these positives

 Surya Grahan 2019 (solar eclipse 2019): This will be the first solar eclipse (surya Grahan 2019) after the start of new year
 haalanki 6 janvari, 2019 ko padane vaala pehla surya grahan (solar Eclipse 2019) bharat main nahin dikhegaa
 However, this will be a Partial Solar Eclipse 2019
 21 janvari ko chandra grahan (lunar Eclipse) bhi he
 Partial Solar Eclipse time will be from 9 am to 18 minutes at five in the morning
 is saal do anya surya grahan (surya Grahan 2019) bhi padenge
 This solar eclipse will be visible in parts of China, Mongolia, Japan, Russia and Alaska except for Surya Grahan in India
 philhal surya grahan (solar Eclipse) ko lekar hollywood or bollywood main kai filmein ban chuki hai
 Many films have been made on Solar Eclipse and Lunar Eclipse, taking the basis of real and fictional story on astronomical events around the world
 grahan se prithvi par padane vaale prabhaavon ke bare main jaankaree filmon main dikhalaayaa gaya he
 However, most films are based on fictional and alleged stories
 surya grahan (solar Eclipse 2019) par filmensaal 1981 main ai hollywood film 'bldi berthde' (bloody Birthday) grahan par hi drama film banaai gai thi
 This film was shown that three children born during the eclipse during 1970 became killers
 grahan ke 10 saal baad jab bachche bhi 10 saal ke ho jate hai to unhen jo log pasand nahin aate vah un sabko maarna shuru kar dete hai
 No one can stop the three children while killing people
 85 minute kii is film main grahan (eclipse) kii vajah se bacchon par padane vaale prabhaavon ke bare main dikhalaayaa gaya he
 The 1995 film "dolores Claiborne" featured scenes of time changes due to films on Solar Eclipse 2019
 ek mahila ko maarane ke liye bhaag rahaa ek shaks achaanak ek gahare gadde main funs jaataa he or jaise hi surya grahan lagata he to us shaks kii girakar maut ho jaati he
 Talking about another film, in the 1985 Ladyhawk film, a couple is cursed to always be together during the solar eclipse and during this curse, the male Everen of Navarre as a wolf Turns, while the woman Isabe d'anjou disguises a hawk
 is dauraan kuch aisi ghatnaayen hoti he, jisaki vajah se film kaaphi interesting ho jaati he
 All these films have been linked to solar eclipse
 itnaa hi nahin, saal 1975 main bollywood kii jaani maani amitabh bachchan or dharmendra kii film 'chupake-chupake' ko doorrshan par dikhaane kii kahani kaaphi interesting hai
 It is also a film based on Solar Eclipse 2019
 mashhoor film diarector hrishikesh mukherjee kii ‘chupake-chupake' jabardast kamedi he, jisamen dharmendra apane jija om prakaash ko sabak sikhaane ke liye aisi kahani gadhate hai ki hansi-thahaake lagate hai
 But in the 1980s, the film was used by the government to protect the public from the outbreak of solar eclipse
 sunne main kuch ajeeb lag saktaa he lekin yah hakeekat he
 The talk is dated 16 February 1980
 surya grahan kaa din tha
 The government did not want the public to see the solar eclipse without any security measures
 isse unki ankhon ko nuksaan pahunchane kii ashanka thi
 The government took measures to keep the public at home
 sarkaar ne hathiyaar banaaya cinema ko or istemaal kiya ek kamedi film ko
 The medium was Doordarshan
 aise main logon ko rokane ke liye yah sabase badhiya hathiyaar bana or sarkaar ne iskaa bakhubi istemaal bhi kiya
 On this day, this hit comedy of Dharmendra and Amitabh Bachchan was telecasted on Doordarshan on the occasion of solar eclipse
 yah manoranjan kii hi takat thi, jisaki vajah se sarkaar ko janata ko ghar main rokane ke liye film kaa khyaal aayaa
 Anyway, Hrishikesh Mukherjee's films used to be so close to life that he easily connected everyone

 Pakistan has a great record in the UAE, but Ganguly believes that this will not put any additional pressure on India

 India's ODI team is good, there are chances of winning the title, but they have to play well to win
 ' In a bid to curb the internal protests within the Punjab Congress, State Congress chief Captain Amarinder Singh took a tough stance and gave a clear message to the opponents that if they do not follow the party line, they will be thrown out of the party
 unhone kaha ki party ummidavaaron ke samarthan main apana naam waapas lene vaale logon ko sarkaar gathan ke baad ahm padon par samahit karne ke liye vah patibaddh hai lekin party avagya sweekaar nahin karegi
 The state Congress chief said that discipline will be maintained in the party and interest of the candidates selected will be taken care of at all costs

 On 15 August 2014, Prime Minister Narendra Modi made many big announcements from the ramparts of the Red Fort
 laal kile kii pracheer se desh ke naam apane pehle bhaashan main pradhanmantri narendra modi ne sabase pehle sansad main sarkaar kii ranneeti kii ruparekha pesh kii thi
 Narendra Modi had said, "we are not people walking on the strength of majority, we do not want to move on the strength of majority
 ham sahmati ke majboot dharaatal par aage badhanaa chaahate hai
 " lekin ek saal baad vipaksh pradhanmantri ke is daawey par sawaal khadey kar rahaa he
 JD-U Principal General Secretary KC Tyagi said, "we did not believe his point even at that time, did PM even try to talk to the opposition once
 
 
 pradhanmantri kehete kuch hai or karte kuch hai"
 While the government is blaming the opposition for the deadlock in Parliament
 sansadeey kaary rajyamantri mukhtaar abbaas nakvi ne enditivi se kaha, "hamane koshish kii ki ham sahmati ke saath aage badhen, lekin ye durbhagyapurna he ki congress ke leader progress par palitha lagane kii koshish kar rahe hai"
 In his first speech, the Prime Minister had also announced several important schemes, under the MP Adarsh gram Yojana, every MP was given the goal of developing a village in his area on the lines of Adarsh village by 2016
 2015 kaa do-tihaai vakt nikal chukaa he lekin abhi tak 100 saansadon ne apane ilaake main gram panchayat kaa chayan bhi nahin kiya he
 West Bengal is behind, where 38 Lok Sabha and 16 Rajya Sabha mps have so far not opted for the Gram Panchayat
 sipiem mahasachiv seetaram yechuri kehete hai, "panchayat raaj bengal main kamazor he
 There is no guarantee whether the money will be used for development in a village
 sabhi saansadon ko dar lagata he ki fund kaa durupyog hoga, lut hogi"
 The second important announcement was about the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, under this, the Prime Minister first fixed the target of making toilet in every school of the country by 15 August this year
 pradhanmantri ne kaha thash jab ham agle 15 agast ko yahaan khadey hon, tab is vishwaas ke saath khadey hon ki ab hindustan kaa aisa koi skool nahin he, jahaan bachche evam bacchiyon ke liye alag toilet kaa nirmaan hona baaki he"
 But despite all the efforts in the last few months, till August 14, 6833 schools were unable to build toilets
 kendriya mantri shripad nayak kehete hai, "rajyon ko ye kaam karnaa he
 
 
 If the state machinery runs a little faster, then quick work will be done ”
 jab enditivi ne madhya pradesh ke grahamantri babu laal goud se ye sawaal poocha to unhone mana ki pehle is mudde ko koi gambhirtha se nahin letaa tha
 Now the work has started due to the attention of the PM and the Chief Minister
 agle ek saal main ham saare skulon main tailet banavaa lenge"
 The Prime Minister also made several announcements on which the government appeared to be working
 garibon ko bank khaaton se jodne ke liye bani pradhanmantri jandhan yojana ke tahat 12 agast 2015 tak 17
 57 crore accounts were opened
 piem ne skill deveopment or skild india kii baat kii or sarkaar ne Skill India Campaign is saal july main laanch kiya
 The Digital India campaign is slowly moving forward to connect the villages with broadband and improve the digital infrastructure in the country
 ek ahm elaan pradhanmantri ne yojana ayog kii jagah ek nai sanstha banane ko lekar kiya, niti ayog kaa gathan hua zarur, lekin pehle saal main niti ayog ke manch par raajnneeti zyaada hoti dikhi he
 Minister of State in PMO Jitendra Singh told NDTV, “NITI Aayog has had a good experience
 lekin prashn unase (vipaksh se) poocha janaa chaiye jinhone siem kii baithak kaa bahishkaar kiya"
 The comments jabaki congress saansad pi el puniya kehete hai, "aaj niti ayog main kuch nahin ho rahaa he, cms ko bulaakar piem land bill par charchaa karte hai
 Let's try to convince them
 sarkaar ko niti ayog gathit karne se pehle uski ruparekha taiyaar karnaa chaiye thi
 Some of the major announcements made by the Prime Minister a year ago have seen the government succeed, some have had to face hurdles and some seem to be behind the target
 dekhnaa hoga ki is saal 15 agast ke apane bhaashan main pradhanmantri agle ek saal ke liye kya lakshya tay karte hai
 But after a year, the opposition is questioning the Prime Minister's claim
 jedy-you ke pradhan mahasachiv kasee tyaagi ne kaha, "hamane unki baat par us samay bhi vishwaas nahin kiya tha, kya piem ne ek baar bhi koshish kii ki wo vipaksh se ek baar baat karen
 
 
 The Prime Minister says something and do something "
 jabaki sarkaar vipaksh ko sansad main gatirodh ke liye zimmedaar bataa rahi he
 Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi told NDTV, "we tried to go ahead with consent, but it is unfortunate that Congress leaders are trying to sabotage progress"
 apane pehle bhaashan main pradhanmantri ne kai ahm yojanaon kii ghoshnaa bhi kii thi, saansad adarsh gram yojana ke tahat har saansad ko 2016 tak apane kshetra main ek gaanv ko adarsh gaanv kii tarz par viksit karne kaa lakshya diya gaya
 Two-thirds of 2015 has passed but so far 100 mps have not even opted for Gram Panchayat in their area
 sabase peeche pashchim bengal he, jahaan 38 loksabhaa or 16 rajyasabha saansadon ne ab tak gram panchayat kaa chayan nahin kiya he
 CPM General Secretary Sitaram Yechury says, “panchayati Raaz is weak in Bengal
 paisa kisi gaanv main vikaas ke liye istemaal hoga yaa nahin koi guarantee nahin he

 2015 kaa do-tihaai vakt nikal chukaa he lekin abhi tak 100 saansadon ne apane ilaake main gram panchayat kaa chayan bhi nahin kiya he
 West Bengal is behind, where 38 Lok Sabha and 16 Rajya Sabha mps have so far not opted for the Gram Panchayat
 sipiem mahasachiv seetaram yechuri kehete hai, "panchayat raaj bengal main kamazor he
 There is no guarantee whether the money will be used for development in a village
 sabhi saansadon ko dar lagata he ki fund kaa durupyog hoga, lut hogi"
 The second important announcement was about the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, under this, the Prime Minister first fixed the target of making toilet in every school of the country by 15 August this year

 But despite all the efforts in the last few months, till August 14, 6833 schools were unable to build toilets
 kendriya mantri shripad nayak kehete hai, "rajyon ko ye kaam karnaa he
 
 
 If the state machinery runs a little faster, then quick work will be done ”
 jab enditivi ne madhya pradesh ke grahamantri babu laal goud se ye sawaal poocha to unhone mana ki pehle is mudde ko koi gambhirtha se nahin letaa tha
 Now the work has started due to the attention of the PM and the Chief Minister

 ) Disturbed by India's stand on the alleged coup in the Maldives, former President Mohammad Nasheed has warned him that New Delhi's power in the country could end with this country going under Chinese influence in the new regime
 khud ko bharat premi bataate hue 44 saal ke nashid ne kaha ki nai dilli ne unki maldivian democratic party (amdipi) ko halke main liya he, haalanki vah duniya ke sabase bade loktantric desh ke vaicharik taur par samarthak he
 He said that unlike former dictator Abdul Gayoom's Progressive Party of Maldives (PPM), his party is loyal to India
 nashid ne kaha, ‘bharat sarkaar ke logon se meraa sawaal he ki agar unako lagata he ki hamane acha kaam nahin kiya to kya ve maanate hai ki nai sarkaar behatar vikalp he
 He said, "unlike PPM, we are people who believe strongly in its role and functioning in the Indian Ocean region
" ham bharat ke saath najdiki rishta chaahate hai
 'this is not the first time Nasheed has expressed disappointment over India's stance on the political crisis in the Maldives
 unka daawa he ki unhen jabaran satta se bedakhal kiya gaya he
 Nasheed said that India should understand the situation in Maldives and it would be 'very strange' if it does not do so
 unhone kaha, ‘bharat hamen halke main le rahaa he
 They know that we will be with them
 yah hamaare liye vaicharik cheez he
 The former President of Maldives said that now China is beginning to play a more active role here
 unhone sanket diya ki maldive kaa rashtriya raksha bal (emndief) beijing ke saath raksha samjhaute kaa navinikaran karne kii utsuk he
 Nasheed said, "china will definitely play an active role
 uski bhoomika ab badi hogi
 He said that after his party came to power in 2008, there was a defense agreement with China, but in 2009 we did not renew it
 unhone kaha, ‘do saptaah pehle tak isse judaa dastavej mere saamne rakhaa tha taaki main hastakshar kar duun
 The MNDF sent me a letter asking them to sign the document
 phir unhone kaha ki mujhe is par hastakshar karnaa hi hoga
 Nasheed, seeking re-election, said that if the Indian government wants to protect its interests, it will have to protect the interests of the people of Maldives
 nashid ne kaha, ‘kya hamane bhartiya samvednaaon ko baadhit kiya tha? aap mujhase bada bharat premi nahin paa sakate
 If they speak against India, i think they are speaking against me
 hamane kabhi kuch bharat ke khilaaf nahin kiya or meri party ne bhi kuch nahin kiya
 'india accepted it soon after the new government was formed in Maldives under the leadership of Mohammad Waheed Hassan
 nashid ne kaha ki sthiti saamaanya ho jane ke baad vah bharat kaa daura karenge or vahaan apane doston se baat karenge
 Asked if he is ready to forget everything when he returns to power, he said, "definitely
" ’ nashid ne desh kii sansad main nai sarkaar ke khilaaf sangharsh kaa sankalp lete hue kaha ki agar jaruri hua to vah savinay avagya andolan shuru karenge

 August 22, 2017 - Supreme Court declares triple talaq unconstitutional
 The Supreme Court ruled in 2017 on triple talaq, saying that triple talaq is unconstitutional
 saath hi chah maheene ke bheetar sarkaar ko kanoon banane ke liye kaha
 The case was heard by a five-judge bench
 15 disambar 2017 - teen talaak par modi sarkaar ne liya sakht faislapradhanmantri narendra modi kii kendriya cabinet ne muslim mahila (vivaah adhikaron kaa sangrakshan) bill, 2017 ko manjuuri di
 Accordingly, three divorces (divorce-e-bidat) together by word of mouth, written or in an electronic manner were made illegal
 aisa karne par jail kii sajaa bhi tay kii
 29 December 2017 - The triple talaq bill was passed in the Lok Sabha by a voice vote on the Muslim Women Marriage Rights Protection Bill relating to triple talaq
 loksabhaa main pesh kiye gaye is bill ke khilaaf sabhi sanshodhan khaarij ho gaye
 5 January 2018 - The triple talaq bill stuck in Rajya Sabha This bill was introduced in Rajya Sabha on 5 January 2018
 jahaan bahumat nahin hone kii vajah ye paas nahin ho sakaa
 In the second term of the Modi government, the Triple Divorce Bill was first passed in the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha on 30 July 2019
 muslim bahulya 22 deshon main bain hai teen talakmisr, pakistan, bangladesh, iraq, srilanka, syria, tunisia, malaysia, indonesia, cyprus, jordan, algeria, iran, bruneii, morocco, katar or sanyukt arab emirate samet 22 deshon main teen talaak par pratibandh he
 In the bill brought against triple talaq, these provisions are oral, written or by any other means
 If a husband gives three divorces to his wife at one time, then he will come under the category of crime
 teen talaak dene par patni swayan yaa uske kareebi rishtedaar hi is bare main cese darj kara sakenge
 According to the Women's Rights Protection Act 2019 bill, giving three divorces at a time is a crime
 isiilie police bina warrant ke teen talaak dene vaale aaropee pati ko giraftaar kar sakati he
 a husband can be imprisoned for up to three years and fined for divorcing three at a time
 magistrate court se hi use jamaanat milegi
 Magistrates will not be able to give bail to a husband who gives three divorces without hearing the victim's side
 teen talaak dene par patni or bachche ke bharan poshan kaa kharch magistrate tay karenge, jo pati ko dena hoga
 In the law on triple talaq, the mother will supervise and care for young children
 nae kanoon main samjhaute ke vikalp ko bhi rakhaa gaya he
 Although the agreement can be reached only on the initiative of the wife, but with appropriate conditions by the magistrate
 kya he talaak-e-bidat?ek samay main teen baar talaak kehane ko talaak-e-bidat kehete hai
 Biddat means the work or process which is considered to be the basic part of Islam and is being adopted for centuries
 jab quran or haddees se koi baat sabit nahin hoti, phir bhi use islam samajhakar apnaanaa yaa maananaa bidat he
 Therefore, Triple Divorce is called divorce-a-biddat
 kyonki talaak lene or dene ke anya islamic tareeke bhi maujuud hai, jo vastav main mahilaon kii bhalaai ke liye laae gaye the
 Prophet Sahab had brought for the rights of women, the condition of Muslim women was bad in the divorce-e-ahsan Aarab
 gulaamon kii tarah unki kharid-bikri hoti thi
 There were many types of divorce as well, in which the rights of women were negligible
 isliye paigambar hazrat mohammad sab khatm karakar talaak-e-ahasan laae the
 It is considered the best way to divorce
 isamen teen baar talaak bolnaa jaruri nahin he
 Once a divorce is called, there is a three-month wait
 agar teen maheene main pati-patni ek saath nahin rahete to talaak ho jaataa he
 This maintains the dignity of the woman
 muslimon main talaak ke anya tareekemuslimon main talaak kaa tarika sirf teen talaak ko samajha jaataa he
 However, the share of divorce resulting from triple talaq is very less
 musalamaanon main talaak, talaak-e-ahasan, talaak-e-hasan, talaak-e-mubaarat jaise prachlit tareeke bhi hai
 Most divorces occur through them

 The funny thing is that those whom you continued to misbehave, obeyed you more than your 'so-called loved ones' and kept your words shameful by increasing the population by 24%
 (kyonki aapke mutabik hai to sabhi hindu kii santan)
 You should be happy on this auspicious occasion, because the opponent you were considering is following your point
 yani, bhedie to aapke ghar main chupe hai, jo khud nasbandi karakar yaa shaadi na karke, dusron ko 10-10 bachche paidaa karne kii salaah dete hai
 Who will listen to such people who could not contribute to increase the population of the country

 And they climb the stage and share the knowledge of having children

 Navjot Singh Sidhu, who started a new innings as a former Indian cricketer and Hindi commentator, termed the role of Sachin Tendulkar as very important for the Indian team going through a change and said that 'master Blaster' has the bat, ' Not the 'sudarshan Chakra' which will succeed all the time
 tendulkar pichhali 10 pariyon main keval 153 ran bana paae hai, jisase yah sawaal uthne lage hai ki kya unhen team main bane rahanaa chahie
 Sidhu, however, rubbished Tendulkar's criticisms and said that in the current era the country cannot even think about his retirement

 On the question of Tendulkar's continued failure, Sidhu said, "sachin is not God, he is also human
" unke paas sudarshan chakra nahin, balla he or balla kabhi-kabhi chukta bhi he
 When he is criticized, it hurts, because Sachin is not a personality but an institution
 vah kohinoor hai or unhen kaanch nahin banaaya ja saktaa
 Heera will always be Heera and i sincerely hope he returns in the next two games

 gitanjay sahuhaal main vibhinn galat vajahon se mumbai kii aare colony khabaron main rahi
 Whether it is the decision of the Mumbai High Court to dismiss the petitions declaring Aarey Colony as protected forest, or to cut down the trees within hours of this order, or to file criminal cases against those who oppose cutting of trees
 supreme court ne 7 aktubar ko sarkaar ko aare main or ped kaatane se roak diya, par tab tak bahut der ho chuki thi
 Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation told the court that it has cut 2,141 trees out of 2,185 trees fixed for cutting
 is bich giraftaar kiye gaye 29 pradarshnakariyon ko jamaanat par reeha kar diya gaya, par isamen bhi nuksaan pehle hi ho chukaa tha
 In fact, criminal charges were filed against him under four sections of the Indian Penal Code
 aare colony 1,287 hectare ilaake main faili he
 It has 4,50,000 trees, including many endangered species
 yahaan 27 adivasee gaanv bhi hai
 Local and state authorities have secretly distributed hundreds of hectares of Aare land for various commercial and development projects over the past five decades
 mumbai metro car shed pariyojna inamen sabase nayaa he jise 33 hectare jameen di gai he
 Opinions are divided in the city about how economically feasible it is to meet the traffic needs and how much environment should be paid for it
 chintaa kii duusari baat yah he ki metro pariyojnaon ko jhatpat puraa karne ke liye aloktantric or aspasht tareeke apanaae gaye
 Despite people's anger and an alternative place, the ruling authorities rejected the notification of Aare's 165 hectare land, defying all opposition
 isse yah jameen 'no deveopment jone' se mukt ho gai or ab 'vyavsaayik istemaal' ke uplabdh he
 The government loudly argued that Aarey is not a forest, but in support of this, it did not put forward any documents or records regarding the status of the land
 biemasi ke vriksh praadhikaran ke visheshgy sadasyon ko fehrist ke pedo ke byoron kii puri jaanch karne ke liye paryaapt samay nahin diya gaya
 Not only this, in the years 2012, 2014 and 2017 there were many discrepancies in the data collected from the project site
 mumbai hycourt ke 4 aktubar ke aadesh ke kuch hi ghanton main ped kaatane main jitani furti dikhaai gai, utani teji pichley kai adeshon ke paalan main nahin barti gai, balki unhen lekar sattadhariyon kii susti saaf dikhaai di thi
 For example, it was also slow to implement the High Court order that asked it to provide basic amenities to the thousands of Worli tribals living in Aarey colony since 1861 — especially the Aboriginal Adivasi Group (PVTG)
 yahaan tak ki pivitiji ko bhedbhaav or daman se bachaane vaale sanvaidhanik praavdhaanon ko bhi darkinar kar diya gaya or yah is vajah se sambhav ho sakaa kyonki aare kii jameen ke darje ko lekar spashtataa nahin he
 The focus of environmental activists is also mainly on the green plantations of saws; No particular concern about the rights of thousands of PVTG tribals of Aarey Colony appears in public discussions and courts
 is bich, mumbai metro korporation ne paryaavaran kii chintaaon ko khaarij kar diya he
 It claims that the project will have a good impact and will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 2,61,000 tonnes every year
 yah paris jalwaayu samjhaute main bharat ko rashtriya str par tay icchit yogadan kii disha main sambhaavnaaon se bharaa kadam najar aata he, lekin mumbai metro kaa yah bayaan mahaj dikhaava he
 Especially given that there is neither an accepted method of estimation of this type nor any authentic data
 maharashtra sarkaar bhi is metro pariyojna ke paryaavaran se jude sambhavit phaaydon ko lekar khaas nagaada peet rahi he, par rajya main paryaavaran kanoonon ko lagu karne ke maamle main iskaa apana record bahut kharaab he
 The large number of Maharashtra's environmental affairs in the Western Bench of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) is proof of this
 sarkaar ko paris samjhaute kii prastaavna par shaayad zyada dhyaan dena chahie
 This preamble calls on all countries to "respect, promote and consider their respective obligations to human rights"
 duusari ore, aare ke pradarshnakariyon ke khilaaf dhamkiyaan or hinsa bad gai hai

 dilli kii satta sambhaal rahi aam aadmi party ne vidhansabha main supreme court ke faisle kaa virodh kiya he
 During the discussion, AAP mlas fiercely surrounded the bjp-ruled Central Government
 mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne twit kar kaha ki,'aam aadmi party SC / ST atyaachaar nivaaran adhinium ke bare main supreme court ke nirnay se utpann hui sthiti main SC / ST samaaj ke andolan ke saath he
 The central government should appoint the eminent senior lawyers of the country for petition in the Supreme Court and the need of the Act and its origin should be preserved
 'dilli vidhansabha kii dipti spikar raakhi birlan ne SC / ST act main badlaav ko lekar sadan main charchaa shuru kii or supreme court se faisle par punarvichaar karne kii maang rakhi
 Rakhi Birlan said that the Dalit class is on the road to rights
 yah behad dukhad he ki supreme court neishchh / ST act1979 main badlaav ke liye aadesh jari kar diya he
 Birlan raised the question in the House whether any poor Dalit would have the courage to use the evidence of caste words uttered by a caste people? During a discussion in the Legislative Assembly, MLA Nitin Tyagi alleged that the BJP was part of Bharat Bandh

 The decision to change the SC / ST Act should be reconsidered

 Today the times are changing, the law is also misused

 'BJP mlas present in the assembly supported the proposal of Aam Aadmi Party mlas on the issue of SC / ST Act

 bihar main loktantr kaa mahaparv, chunaav kaa rang aisa chadha he kii rangon ke tyohaar holi kaa rang is varsh feekaa pad gaya he
 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar is away from the Holi festival this year, so the view of the famous 'kurtafad Holi' is not visible even at the residence of lalu-rabri, who holds an important place in the politics of Bihar
 bihar ke mukhyamantri ne pichley varsh chhapra ke mashrakh prakhand main dharmasti gandaman gaanv ke ek sarkari vidhyalay main madhyahn bhojan khaane se 23 bacchon kii maut ke kaaran holi nahin khilne kaa nirnay liya he
 Due to this, there is silence on the official residence of the Chief Minister of Bihar on the day of Holi
 mukhyamantri awaas main to hai, parantu holi se dur hai
 Here, there is silence this year at the residence of former Chief Minister Rabri Devi and Lalu Prasad at 10 Circular Road, Patna, which has become a center for Holi for years
 lalu ke awaas par holi nahin khele jane ke kaaran rashtriya janata dal (rajd) ke kaaryakarta to maayoos hai hi, patna main kurta faad holi khilne waalon ko bhi is varsh holi khilne kaa bharpoor mauka nahin mila
 It is worth mentioning that whether Lalu had been the Chief Minister or the Union Minister or his party had been in opposition role in Bihar, Holi used to remain awe at his residence
 kurtafad holi ke saath-saath fagua ke geet ke bich thandi kaa daur chalata rahata tha, jisamen log holi ke rang main sarabor ho jate the
 Here, Holi was played at the residence of Director General of Police Abhyanand in Bihar and the songs of Fagua kept echoing
 is dauraan abhyaanand bhi jamkar holi ke geet gaae or pulicekarmiyon ko rang-gulaal lagaakar holi kii shubhakamana di
 He said that the policemen do not get holiday on the festival of Holi, due to this, the policemen gather at one place and celebrate Holi

 Not only this, he also cast a fatal spell in the Mushtaq Ali Trophy against North Zone just before the auction where he took 3 wickets for 10 runs which included players like Shikhar Dhawan, Yuvraj Singh and Rishabh Pant, but after disappointment in IPL auction Irfan Pathan shared an emotional tweet with his fans
 irafaan ne likhaa ki 2010 main meri peeth main 5 frectures kii surgery hui
 The physio had said at that time that i might never be able to play cricket now and i should forget my dream

 Let me tell you that Irfan was with Pune last season, but he was mostly excluded from the team

 tiares pramukh ne mamata ke samakshagaamee loksabhaa chunaavake liye congress ko dur rakhkar federal front khadaa kiye jane kii baat kahi thi

 After the Gandhian Anna Hazare's fast in April, the government formed a joint committee to expedite the process of drafting the Lokpal Bill

 Reacting to the draft bill approved by the cabinet, the Hazare side termed it a "cruel joke" with the people of the country
 samaaj ke sadasyon ne doharaaya ki hazaare is vidheyak ko waapas lene or nayaa majboot vidheyak sansad main pesh karne kii maang ko lekar 16 agast se phir anshan karenge
 Prashant Bhushan of the Hazare side also claimed that it would be unconstitutional to exempt the Prime Minister from being brought under the purview of Lokpal if the same bill was passed
 is riyaayat ko ucchtam nyaayalay main chunauti di ja sakegi
 In this context, Bhushan referred to the 39th amendment of the Constitution made by the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in 1975, under which the election of the Prime Minister could not be challenged in court
 unhone kaha ki is sanshodhan ko ucchtam nyaayalay kii chah sadasyeey peeth ne sire se khaarij kar diya tha

 The final decision on the recommendations of the Chief Justice will be that of the President
 khurshid ne spasht kiya ki lokapal kii nishpakshta ko banaaye rakhane ke liye yah praavdhaan kiya gaya he ki is pad par asin hone ke baad vah bhavishya main kabhi bhi kisi dal se chunaav nahin lard sakenge
 He said that to maintain the credibility of Lokpal, it has been decided not to include any leader among its members
 masauda vidheyak kahata he ki lokapal ko bhavishya main abhiyojan chal sakane kii sambhaavna vaale maamalon main aapraadhik aapraadhik dand prakriya samhita 1973 kii dhara 197 or bhrashtachar nirodhak kanoon 1988 kii dhara 19 ke tahat manjuuri praapt karne kii jarurat nahin hogi

 The leaders of Delhi were meeting Rahul Gandhi
 dilachasp baat yah thi ki unki is mulaakaat main congress ke baagi netaa arvinder singh lavali bhi shaamil the
 After the meeting, Arvinder Singh came out in the same car with Lovely, Aaron Yusuf and Ajay Maken and shortly after in the press conference announced that he had returned home to the party after 11 months

 For Arvinder Singh Lovely then the Congress party was a corrupt party that was buying and selling tickets in the MCD elections
 unke mutabik congress kaa ' bhavishya ' khatm ho gaya tha
 This was the time when the MCD elections were on the head and the Congress party needed them most
 wo party jisane unhen khadaa kiya, dekhte dekhte wo party kaa bada cheharaa ban gayi

 On the other hand, Arvinder Singh Lovely Homecoming fits perfectly in the political arithmetic of Rahul Gandhi's favorite Maken
 2014 main kaman sanbhaalane ke baad maakan ke chalate kai kaddavar netaa alag thalag padate ja rahe the
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi also instructed Maken to keep his clan united

 If a woman could not conceive even after making active efforts without using contraceptives for one year, would you call it infertility? The World Health Organization (WHO) has extended its time limit to two years
 jab koi mahila 40-44 ke aayu varg main pahunch jaati he or garbh nirodhakon ke bina sambhog ke baavjood 'jivit bachche' ko janm nahin de paati to banjhapan 'santanheenata' main badal jaataa he

 Some of the important components of this journey are as follows: ताजा The latest election results of Gujarat, Punjab, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Telangana
 gujarat or karnataka udyog-niryaat-krishi-khanij-seva aadhaarit arthvyasthaayen hai jabaki madhya pradesh, punjab or telugana kii arthvyavastha main krishi kaa bada hissaa he
 Chhattisgarh is an agriculture and mineral based state and Rajasthan is a service and agriculture based state
 ye rajya desh kii anya arthvyavasthaaon kaa sample hai
 में In the last decade, the statistics of rural wages, economic growth, agricultural growth rate and election results have to be kept together
 ▪ bharat main loksabhaa kii kareeb 380 siten puri tarah gramin hai jinamein 86 siten un rajyon main hai jinke sabase taaja nattejey hamaare saamne hai
 In view of the economic and agricultural development of the states, there are three conclusions about the results of the assembly
 • gujarat, karnataka, madhya pradesh, chhattisgarh, rajasthan main chunaav ke saal aarthik vikaas dar pichley paanch saal ke ausat se kam (crisil report) thi
 The BJP barely returned to power in Gujarat
 anya rajyon main baaji palat gai jabaki kuch rajyon main to vipaksh tha hi nahin yaa der se jaagaa tha
 Where the impact of the recession was deep like in Chhattisgarh, the refusal was sharper
 yani logon ke faisle vaadon par nahin, sarkaron ke kaam par aadhaarit the
 • After 2015-16 (one or two years before the election), the agricultural growth rate declined in all the above states
 puure desh main gramin mazdooree dar main kami or sakal krishi vikaas dar main giravat ke taaja aankade isaki taakid karte hai
 • After 2014, in the states where power has changed, the economic and agricultural growth rate of the state has decreased around the election year
 telugana (bihar or bengal bhi) apwaad hai jahaan vikaas dar paanch saal ke ausat se zyada thi
 The appearance of farming here was better than in the country, so the result was favorable to the government
 in aankadon kii roshni main loksabhaa chunaav kaa paridrishy kaisaa dikhataa he
 According to the agriculture department, the condition of farming in 11 states of the country is not good
 inamen haryana, punjab, madhya pradesh, gujarat or uttar pradesh main pichley teen se paanch varshon main saamaanya se kam barish hui he
 Bihar, Andhra Pradesh and Bengal are the major states where the problems of farming are less than other parts of the country
 • gramin arthvyavastha main baari sansaadhan jhonk kar mandi roki ja sakati he
 The UPA invested heavily in the rural economy after 2004, much like the government did in Telangana
 modi sarkaar ke bajaton kii padtaal bataati he ki 2015 se 2018 ke bich gramin arthvyavastha ko sarkaar kii madad, isse pehle ke paanch varsh kii tulana main kam thi
 Seeing the political impact of the rural recession, debt was waived in the states after 2017 and the Center raised the support price
 kisaan nakad sahaayta bhi isi kaa nateeja he
 But perhaps it is late and the agrarian crisis is much deeper
 apwaadon ko chhodkar votaron kaa yahi rukh 1995 ke baad hue adhikansh chunaavon main dikhaa he
 Governments returned to states where economic or agricultural growth rates were right
 2000 ke baad ke ek dashak main rajyon main sabase zyada sarkarein doharaai gayi kyonki vah kheti or aarthik vikaas kaa sabase acha daur tha
 The 2004 election saw the impact of a drought and a slowdown in agriculture on the voters' decisions (NDA debacle)
 jabaki 2009 main mahangaai ke baavjood centre main upie ko dobaaraa chunaa gaya
 Apart from corruption in 2014, there was a big reason for the reversal of the farming government
 aarthik aankade saboot hai ki netaaon kii chaalaaki ke anupaat main matadaataaon kii samajhadaari bhi badi he

 vidhya parvat shrinkhalaa (mirzapur, upi) ke madhya patit paavani ganga ke kanth par virajman maa vindhyavasini devi mandir shraddhaluon kii aasthaa kaa pramukh kendra he
 Vindhyachal is one of the 51 Shaktipeeths of the country
 sabase khaas baat yah he ki yahaan teen kilometre ke daayre main teen pramukh deviyaan virajman hai
 It is believed that a visit to Vindhyachal is considered incomplete without seeing the three goddesses
 teenon ke kendra main hai maa vindhyavasini
 Mahakali is situated near Kalikoh hill and Ashtabhuji Devi is sitting on Ashtabhuja hill
 shastron main maa vindhyavasini ke aitihaasik mahatmaya kaa alag-alag varnan miltaa he
 In Shiva Purana, mother Vindhyavasini is considered to be Sati and Shrimad Bhagwat is called Nandja Devi
 maa ke anya naam krishnanuja, vandurga bhi shastron main varnit hai
 In this Maha Shaktipeeth, worship is done by Vedic and Left Way method
 shastron main is baat kaa bhi ullekh miltaa he ki adishkti devi kahin bhi purnroop main virajman nahin hai, vindhyachal hi aisa sthaan he jahaan devi ke puure vigrah ke darshan hote hai
 According to the scriptures, in different Shaktipeeths, different parts of the Goddess are worshiped symbolically
 lagbhag sabhi puraanon ke vindhyas mahatmaya main is baat kaa ullekh he ki 51 shaktipeethon main maa vindhyavasini hi purnpeeth he
 The temple doors are closed four times a day for special adornment of the mother during Navratri
 saamaanya dinon main mandir ke kapaat raat 12 baje se bhor 4 baje tak band rahete hai
 Mahanisha worship is also important in Navratri
 yahaan ashtami tithi par vamamargi tathaa dakshin margi tantrikon kaa jamaavada rahata he
 After midnight, the standing puja begins
 aisa mana jaataa he ki tantric yahaan apni tantra vidya siddh karte hai
 It is said that on the days of Navratri, the mother dwells on the flag of the temple so that those who do not reach the temple due to some reason, can also see the subtle form of the mother
 navaratri ke dinon main itani bheed hoti he ki adhisankhya log maa kii pataakaa ke darshan karke hi khud ko dhanya maanate hai
 It is said that worshiping the mother done here with true heart never goes in vain
 har roj yahaan hajaaron log mattha tekte hai or devi maa kaa pujan jai maa vindhyavasini ke udghosh ke saath karte hai
 Triangle Yatra has special significance in this Dham of Maa in which small and large triangles travel
 laghu trikon yatra main ek mandir parisar main maa ke 3 roopon ke darshan hote hai vahiin duusari ore brihad trikon yatra main teen alag-alag roopon main maa vindhyavasini, maa mahakali va maa ashtabhuji ke darshanon kaa saubhaahgya bhakton ko miltaa he
 After the visit of Maa Mahakali in the Brihad Triangle Yatra, the next stop comes to the mother Ashtabhuji where she performs the welfare of her devotees in eight-armed forms
 kehete hai is mandir main darshan karne ke baad hi bhakton kii brihad trikon yatra purna hoti he
 Siddh Peetha of mother Pitambara now talks about Siddh Peetha of mother Pitambara of Jhansi
 maa kaa ye dham anokhaa isliye he kyonki bhakton ko yahaan maa apane bhakton ko ek jharokhe se detii hai darshan
 Mother Pitambara! Mother who defeats enemies, gives boon of victory, defeats her mother
 is siddhapitha kii visheshta hi yahi he ki yahaan se kabhi koi khaali haath nahin jaataa, yahaan koi pukaar kabhi ansuni nahin rahati, raja ho yaa rank, maa ke netra sabhi par ek samaan krupa barasaate hai
 Maa Pitambara This Siddhapeeth is located in Datia district of Jhansi, Madhya Pradesh
 jisaki sthapana 1935 main param tejasvi swami ji ke dwaara kii gai
 The birth place, name, and name of the mother Pitambara remains a mystery till date
 maa kaa ye chamatkaari dham swami ji ke jap or tap ke kaaran hi ek siddh peeth ke rup main deshbhar main janaa jaataa he
 The mother Pitambara, who is seated in the form of the quadrilateral, holds the mace in one hand, the vajra in the third, and the tongue of the demon in the fourth hand
 bhakton ke jivan main maa ke chamatkaar ko aae din ghatate dekha ja saktaa he lekin is darbar main bhakton ko maa ke darshan ek choti si khidki se hi hote hai
 Visitors are not allowed to touch the mother's statue
 mana jaataa he ki maa bagulamukhi hi peetambara devi hai isliye unhen pili vasteen chadhaai jaati hai
 But pleasing the mother is not so easy
 iske liye karnaa hota he vishesh anushthan, jisamen bhakt ko pile kapade pahanane hote hai, maa ko pili vasteen chadhaai jaati hai or phir maangi jaati he muraad
 It is said that if rituals are performed by law, the mother will soon fulfill the wishes of the devotees
 maa peetambara ko rajasatta kii devi mana jaataa he or usee rup main bhakt karte hai maa kii aradhana
 Devotees who wish for royalty come here and offer secret worship
 maa peetambara shatru naash kii adhishthatri devi he tathaa rajasatta prapti main maan kii puja kaa vishesh mahatv hota he
 Along with the mother Pitambara in the temple, there is a good fortune of darshan of Khandeshwar Mahadev and Dhumavati
 mandir ke daayin ore virajte hai khandeshwar mahadev jisaki tantric rup main kii jaati hai puja
 As soon as Mahadev steps out of the court, one of the ten Mahavidyas, mother Dhumavati is seen
 sabase anokhi baat ye he ki bhakton ko maa dhoomavati ke darshan kaa saubhaahgya keval aarti ke samay hi praapt hota he kyonki baaki samay mandir ke kapaat band rahete hai
 Everyone's wishes are fulfilled by the grandeur of the mother
 bhakton ko sukh samruddhi or shanti milti he, yahi vajah he ki maa ke darbar main dur dur se bhakt aate hai, maa kii mahima gaate hai or jholii main khushiyaan bhar kar ghar le jate hai

 ' The Supreme Court has granted bail to Rajesh Talwar and has retained his bail
 ab unki jamaanat 4 farvari tak barkaraar rahegi
 The court has directed that the Talwar couple will appear before the lower court on 4 February
 arushi hatyakand maamle ke aaropee rajesh talwaar ke khilaaf jamaanti warrant par supreme court ne somvaar ko sunwaayee kii
 The Aarushi murder case, which has been stuck in court circles for three years, took a major turn a few days ago when the Supreme Court gave the green signal to prosecute Rajesh Talwar and Nupur Talwar
 darasal shuruaati jaanch ke dauraan rajesh talwaar ko poochtacha ke liye hiraasat main liya gaya tha lekin sibiai ke jamaanat kaa virodh na karne par jamaanat par reeha bhi kar diya
 The twist in the case came after the cbi's December 2010 closure report and the case reopened rather than closed
 nichali adaalat ne ise talwaar dampatti par mukadmaa chalaaye jane ke liye kaaphi mana or rajesh talwaar ke khilaaf jamaanti warrant jari kar diya
 According to Rajesh Talwar, he was already on bail and had also filled the necessary bond then why the bailable warrant? According to the CBI, Talwar himself has now completed the necessary formalities for bail in the lower court, so now this application has no merit and it is just an attempt to further complicate the case
 nyaayamurti eke ganguli or nyaayamurti jees khehar ne aapraadhik kaarywahi khatm karne kii talwaar danpati kii arji ko khaarij kar kaha tha ki ve is hatyakand main antarim jamaanat par sunwaayee karenge
 Significantly, the only child of the Talwar couple, Aarushi (14), was found dead at her residence in Noida on the night of 15-16 May 2008
 uski galaa ret kar hatya kar di gai thi
 On 6 January, the Supreme Court asked the dentist couple to face trial in the murder of ninth grade student and Hemraj
 peeth ne kaha tha ki unke (talwaar danpati) khilaaf sangyaan lene ke gajiabad ke magistrate ke aadesh main or un par mukadmaa chalaae jane main kuch bhi galat nahin tha kyonki nichali adaalat ke nyaayadhish ne soch vichaar kar aadesh jari kiya tha
 The Uttar Pradesh police initially investigated the case and arrested Aarushi's father on 23 May 2008
 baad main, maamle kii jaanch 29 may 2009 ko sibiai ko saunp di gai or rajesh ko 11 july 2008 ko gajiabad kii adaalat se jamaanat mil gai
 The CBI, after investigating the case for more than two and a half years, submitted a closure report to the Ghaziabad special CBI court, stating that it had been unable to find any evidence to prosecute the Talwar couple
 haalanki, nichali adaalat ne maamle ko band karne kii sibiai kii report ko khaarij karte hue kaha ki is dohare hatyakand main dampatti kii kathith sanliptata ko lekar unke khilaaf mukadmaa chalaane ke liye agency kii report main pratham drushtya paryaapt saamagree he
 The magistrate took cognizance of the case and issued summons to the Talwar couple on 9 February 2011
 iske baad rajesh or nupur (arushi ke mata pita) ne elahabaad ucch nyaayalay kaa rukh kiya, jisane nichali adaalat ke saman or unke khilaaf shuru kii gai kaarywahi ko khaarij karne se inkaar kar diya
 The Talwar couple then moved to the apex court which stayed the hearing against them on 19 March last year but it was lifted on Friday
 dilli se sate faridabad main gaurakshakon kii gundgardee kaa ek sansaneekez maamla saamne aayaa he
 a disabled autodriver named Azad and 4 people belonging to his family were brutally beaten up by cowards on suspicion of carrying cow meat

 Azad told them that this is a buffalo meat but the gau rakshaks did not listen to it
 jab azaad ne khud ko bachaane ke liye apane teen bhaiyon ko bulaayaa to in kathith gaurakshako ne unki bhi jamkar pitayee kar di
 He did not stop here, he also tried to burn petrol over Azad, but the jailor of the area came and saved Azad's life somehow

 agra kii yatra do chizon ke bina adhuri rahati he
 One of them is the darshan of the Taj Mahal symbol of love and the other is the famous Petha of Agra
 railway adhikariyon va nijee vikritaon kii khinchataan ke bich beete do saal se railway stesan par agra ke pethe kii bikri band he or yatriyon ko apana munh meetha kiye bina hi yahaan se guzarana pad rahaa he
 Madan Garg, who led a delegation of Petha manufacturers to meet Divisional Railway Manager (DRM) Devesh Mishra, seeking to lift the ban on sale of petha at the railway station, said, "it is an injustice to tourists passing through here
" is
 unhen agra ke steshnon par ek-do kilo petha kharidne kii ijaajat nahin di ja rahi he
 'railways had given the contract of supply of petha to a private company in the entire Agra region, but this company did not meet certain conditions and problems started to arise
 ab maamla adaalat main lambit he
 Former Union Deputy Minister and Samajwadi Party (SP) National General Secretary Ramji Lal Suman has written a letter to the General Manager of North Central Railway saying that banning the sale of Pethe is clearly a violation of the rights of passengers
 brij mandal heritage conjarveshan sosayadi ke adhyaksh surendra sharma kehete hai, ‘railway ko yaa to sthaneey dukandaaron ko vahaan apni dukaane lagane kii ijaajat deni chahie yaa stesan par khud kii dukaane kholani chahie
 'he said,' Unauthorized vendors roam in trains between Mathura and Agra and sell petha to passengers
 har roj unamem se kai ko pakad liya jaataa he or un par jurmaana thoka jaataa he
 Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Limited (IRCTC) has opened a Pethe shop at Agra Cantonment station but this alone shop is not enough
 stesan par ek kuli rampal ne bataaya, ‘railgadiyaan bahut kam samay ke liye rukati hai isliye yatri petha kharidne ke liye dukaan tak jane kaa jokhim nahin uthaa sakate
 People ask us from where to buy Petha but when we ask them to get down from the train and go to the shop to buy Petha, they hesitate
 ’railway adhikari chah maheene pehle mahila samoohon, sahakaari samoohon or swanyasevi sanghathanon ko steshnon par apni-apni dukaane kholane ke liye manjuuri dene ke liye sahamat ho gaye the lekin is disha main ab tak kuch nahin hua he

 However, it is not yet clear whether the madrasa students were asked to raise slogans or not
 is maamle main ek aaropee ko giraftaar kiya gaya he or aage kii jaanch chal rahi he
 Let us tell you that Maulana Naeem Misbahi of the Jama Masjid of Unnao had alleged that some people asked the students playing cricket to speak 'jai Shri Ram' and when they did not speak Jai Shri Ram, the miscreants harassed and assaulted the students 
 unhone aarope lagaaya tha ki badasluki ke baad chaatro par patharav kiya gaya

 obama ke china daure se pehle chape sampadakeey main kaha gaya he ki obama ne apane ab tak ke chah saal ke kaarykaal main 'bekaar' or 'neeras' kaam kiye hai

 But there is no peace left

 obama kii aad main china ne america vyavastha par bhi tanj ksaa he
 The Global Times wrote that George Bush, who risked doing everything and Obama who did nothing, belonged to different parties, but both had the same fate
 'kya yah inaki samasya he yaa phir yah masalaa puure america vyavastha kaa he?''america itnaa sust he ki vahaan sudhaar sambhav nahin he'
 It has also been claimed at the end of the editorial that with the development of China, understanding about America is also developing
 'global times' china kii sattadhari communist party kaa akhbaar he
 This is the reason that this attack on Obama is being considered as the handiwork of the Chinese government

 anandiben patel ne somvaar ko soshal media par jaise hi likhaa ki wo ab mukhyamantri pad se hatana chaahati hai, gujarat ke siyaasi galiyare main bhunchal aa gaya
 In the last two days, as Anandiben Patel was making announcements about government schemes one after the other, everyone must be wondering what the Chief Minister is doing
 anandiben ne do dinon main 4 bade faisle liye jiske jariye unhone apni ek sakaaratmak chhavi gadhane karne kii koshish kii
 First, he gave a decree to abolish toll tax on all small trains in Gujarat, and the second major announcement was made with the Patidars in which they decided to withdraw 90 percent of the cases of riots during the Patidar agitation
 teesraa bada faisla 8 lakh sarkari or ritred sarkari karmchaariyon ke liye khushi lekar aayaa jisamen anandiben ne 1 agast se saatven vetan ayog ko lagu kiye jane kii ghoshnaa kar di or chauthi ghoshnaa aaj fasebuk par apni post likhane se pehle kii jisamen 80 pratishat se zyada ank laane vaali chaatraon ko free hair ajukeshan die jane kaa elaan kiya
 Let us know what the circumstances became, due to which Anandiben had to announce her resignation
 1) patidaar aarakshan andolanpichley ek saal se gujarat main chal rahe patidaar aarakshan andolan nemukhyamantri anandiben patelki bhoomika par hi sawaal khadey kar die the
 During the Patidar agitation for the first time after the 2002 riots, curfew was imposed in Gujarat which was considered a major setback for Anandiben Patel
 saath hi patidaaron ko control karne ke liye sena tak ko tainaat karnaa padaa
 When the Patidar movement became fierce, slogans were raised against the BJP
 patidaar andolan ke dauraan bijepi kii andruni kalah bhi baahar aa gai jisane anandiben sarkaar ko haasiye par laakar khadaa kar diya
 Even the government could not find any means of reconciliation with the Patidars
 2) anandiben or shah ke bich cold varanandiben ke mukhyamantribanane ke baad se hi unke or bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ke bich cold waar chal rahaa tha
 Anandiben and Shah did not like to come together on one stage
 agar aate bhi the to unke bich kii dooriyaan saaf dikhti thi
 Meanwhile, there was a lot of ruckus over the ticket distribution between Anandiben and Shah's faction in the civic elections
 is vajah se nikaay chunaavon main bijepi ko kaaphi nuksaan bhi uthaanaa padaa tha
 3) The charge of familism was said to Anandiben Patel that her government is run by her son and daughter
 yahaan tak ki unpar unki beti anaar patel ko karodon kii van vibhaag kii jameen galat tareeke se beti ko dene ke aarope bhi lage
 The Congress gave up the issue of giving land to Anandiben Patel's daughter in such a way that the Modi government at the Center had to answer
 4) dalit andolanpatidaar andolanke baad gujarat ke oona main gaurakshakon ne jis tarah daliton ko peeta or mayawati ne mudde ko sansad main uchhaala, anandiben sarkaar ek baar phir baikfoot par aa gai
 The Anandiben government handed over the case to the CID in a hurry, but the government took some more concrete steps, people from the Dalit community took to the streets and more than 25 people attempted suicide while opposing the government
 yahaan tak ki gujarat main dalit mahasammelan hua to usamen bhi baari taadaad main jute daliton ne anandiben patel sarkaar ko gherne main koi kasar nahin chodi
 5) Age limitandibenne of 75, while referring to the policy of the party of 75 years old on her Facebook post, said that she herself wants to step down from her responsibility
 lekin narendra modi kii kareebi raheen anandiben patel kaa yah faisla modi sarkaar ke liye bhi kaaphi ahm mana ja rahaa he
 Experts are assuming that this Facebook post of Anandiben has not come suddenly, for this, through the Prime Minister, Anandiben has been taken fully confident that any big responsibility should be given to Anandiben
 jaankaar maanate hai ki anandiben patel ko ab kisi rajya kaa governor banaaya jaaya saktaa he
 However, a proposal for the name of Anandiben can also be sent for the election of the Vice President after this
 vaise yah dekhnaa kaaphi dilachasp hoga ki anandiben ko mukhyamantri pad se hataa kar party ne or khaas kar pradhanmantri modi ne unke liye kya bhoomika tay kii he
