 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar said that the era of coalition will continue in the country and that this coalition will run successfully and the government should remain stable for it to need a government headed by the largest party in the alliance

 Nitish said, 'advani has put his point through the blog and we also feel that people and those watching the politics of the whole country will accept that now the phase is not of one party rule, now of coalition Is round
 ’ unhone kaha ek gathbandhan purv pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi ke netritv main chalaa or bahut hi shandaar dhang se gathbandhan kii sarkaar chali
 Nitish said that a coalition government is currently running, whose performance has been disappointing
 lekin unhen lagata he ki gathbandhan kaa hi daur chalegaa
 He said that there have been other types of coalitions as well, for example the Deve Gowda government was also a coalition government, but the largest party supporting it was outside the government, due to which there was always a crisis on the stability and stability of that government and stable government Not proved pradhanmantri pad ke daavedaaron ke bare main nitish ne kaha ‘koi bhi gathbandhan agar chunaav ke maidan main jaataa he to use apana netaa chunaav ke purv ghoshit kar dena chahie
 This benefits, because people also examine them, discuss about them and have a good effect
 ’ nitish ne kaha ‘ham logon ne bihar main bhi dekha he, anya rajyon main bhi dekha he or desh main rajg kii sarkaar bani to atal ji netaa the or unka naam pehle se ghoshit tha, jiskaa phayda hua tha
 'he said that this is also the opinion of his party (JDU), but there is still time for elections
 nitish ne kaha ki adwani ji ke blog main likhi baton par unhone gaur kiya he or unhen aisa lagata he ki samekit rup main jo baaten hai uskaa koi nichod baahar main charchaa nahin he, balki ek hisse ko lekar zyada prachaar ho rahaa he
 He said that he had also said in a context in the past that there is no attempt to understand Advani
 nitish ne kaha ki usko lekar jo report chhapin hai or uskaa jo vishleshan hua he, vah anya prakaar se hua he or unki samaj se unke blog se aisi koi dhwani nahin nikalati he
 Nitish said that he feels that he has written on the basis of what he sees as a senior politician
 unhone kaha ki adwani ji ne gaiyr bhaajapa evam gaiyr congressi sarkaar kii baat jis sandarbh main kahi he or uskaa udhaaharan bhi diya he ki is tarah kii sarkarein sthir nahin rah paati hai
 Nitish said that Advani has said that the popularity of the Congress party is declining
 OROP par centre sarkaar par aakraamak rukh apnaane kii congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi kii mehnat rang laati dikh rahi he, congress sutron kii maane to purv sainik aane vaale vidhansabha chunaavon main congress ko samarthan kar sakate he
 Ex-servicemen can support the Congress in Punjab, Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh
 congress sutron ke mutabik congress iskaa elaan guruuvar ko press conference main kar sakati he, press conference main uttarakhand ke siem harish ravat, himachal pradesh ke siem virbhadra singh or punjab ke purv mukhyamantri captain amarinder singh purv sainikon ke saath shaamil ho sakate hai
 Significantly, the Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi has surrounded the Modi government on the issue of rop, while Rahul Gandhi has also written a letter to PM Modi in this regard
 rahul gandhi ne purv sainik ramakrishna greval kii aatmahatya par sadak par hangaamaa bhi kiya tha
 In fact, there are more than 25 lakh ex-servicemen all over the country, the Congress believes that there is a large number of ex-servicemen in the hilly regions and in Punjab and thus the Congress will get a lot of support in the election due to its support

 This question was about the session, oath and the Protem Speaker

 Third question - If the government has majority then why is there no majority test by secret ballot
 protem spikar ne die ye jawabprotem spikar dilip valase patil ne fadanvis ke pehle sawaal par kaha ki vidhansabha main sadan se jude masalon par hi charchaa kii jaaegi
 In response to the second question, the Protem Speaker said that the Cabinet has the right to change the Protem Speaker
 mantrimandal ne apni sifarish rajyapal ko bheji thi
 The Protem Speaker has been replaced following the Governor's order
 yah nayaa satr nahin he
 Responding to the third question of Devendra Fadnavis, Protem Speaker Dilip Valse Patil said that secret voting is not being done as per the order of the Supreme
 supreme court ne saaf kaha tha ki harse trading ko rokane ke liye gupt matdaan nahin hoga or sadan kii kaarywahi kaa live telecast hoga

 Shiv Sena claimed before floor test that mns's only MLA will also support Maha Vikas Aghadi

 unhone protem spikar badal diya
 The Protem speaker remains the same until the new speaker is chosen according to the rules

 Aamir Khan's film Dhoom-3 has created a buzz in India but you will be surprised to know that this film has created a new record in Pakistan too, by destroying all the records at the box office
 pakistan ke cinema gharon main dhooma-3 ke rojaanaa paanch sho dikhaae ja rahe hai
 In Karachi, Dhoom-3 earned around two crore rupees from 56 screens on the first day
 is film ne pichley maheene pradarshit pakistani film waar ke pradarshan ke pehle din kii box offis kamai ke record ko aasaani se dhwast kar diya
 Nadeem Mandviwala, one of the leading exhibitors and distributors of Pakistan, told that War 1 on the first day of the performance
 14 karod rupee kii aamadani kii thi lekin dhooma-3 kii lokapriyata or kamai kaa aankada isse kahin adhik rahaa
 This is the first time in Pakistan's film history that multiplexes are showing the same film on all their screens and also five shows are being shown every day
 mandaviwala ne kaha, 'is baat main shaq nahin he ki dhooma-3 ek badi hit he or isamen aamir kaa hona or iske pradarshan se pehle kiya gaya prachaar isaki lokapriyata kaa bada kaaran he
 ' chunaavon ke dangal ke shuru hote hi chunaav ayog ne chetaya he ki dharmik or jaateey aadhaar par vot maangane vaale netaaon or raajnneetik dalon kii khayr nahin
 After issuing notice to Sakshi Maharaj, the Commission has written a letter to all parties
 ayog ne kade shabdon main kaha ki dharmik sthalon par chunaav prachaar karnaa, jaateey yaa dharmik manyataon kii duhai dekar vot maangana aachaar samhita kaa ulanghan he, lihaaza partiyaan apane sabhi netaaon ko is bare main suchit kar den
 In its directive, the commission has also cited the recent decision of the Supreme Court
 chunaav ayog nesakshi maharajako isi babat notice jari kar 11 janvari tak jawaab talab kiya he, ayog ke sutron ke mutabik supreme court ke faisle ke saath is nirdesh kii prati chunaav vaale paanchon rajyon main zila str ke sabhi chunaav adhikariyon ko bheji gai he, saath hi main tamaam baarikiyon ke saath ayog ke nirdesh bhi bheje gaye he
 It is to be noted that during the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the commission had banned BJP national president Amit Shah and Samajwadi Party leader Azam Khan from campaigning, blaming them for making inflammatory speech on religious grounds in violation of the code of conduct
 This time also the Election Commission's stance is strong and the intention is clear that the leaders' negligence will not be forgiven
 kya aapako yaad he ki bhopal kii saansad sadhvi pragna ko bhartiya janata party ne tikat kyon diya tha? sadhvi pragna ko tikat dena bijepi ke liye satyagrah tha
 Without waiting for the truth of the court, this way of doing Satyagraha will not be in the imagination of Gandhiji's Satyagraha
 amit shah kii kalpana main tha
 You know that the case is going on in the Malegaon blast case on Sadhvi Pragya and they are on bail
 adalati cese ko farji kehane kii parampara rahi he or kai baar cese farji hote bhi hai lekin kai baar aisa bhi hota he ki asli cese main log farji tareeke se reeha bhi ho jate hai
 But in the presence of Prime Minister Modi on 17 May, Amit Shah had said that Satyagraha was given ticket for Sadhvi Pragya
 satyagrah bahut bada faisla hota he
 His morality is much greater than political deceit
 april 2019 main times nau ko die ek intervyuu main pradhanmantri modi ne sadhvi pragna kii ummidavaari par puche gaye sawaal par kaha tha ki duniya main paanch hazaar saal tak jis mahaan samskruti or parampara ne vasudaiv kutunbakam kaa sandesh diya
 Calling such culture a terrorist
 un sabko jawaab dene ke liye simbal he
 The BJP had carried out a satyagraha for Sadhvi Pragya, whose statement about Godse being described as a patriot has made her so annoyed that one day she is refused to attend a parliamentary party meeting and was removed from the defense committee of Parliament
 kya pataa raksha samiti main laana bhi kisi tarah kaa satyagrah ho
 In an interview in April 2019, Prime Minister Modi himself said that Sadhvi has described Pragya as the heritage of Indian civilization
 ab satyagrah kii paribhaasha bhi sadhvi pragna kii raajnneetik suvidha ke hisaab se gadhi jane lage to gandhi kii aatma kii shanti kii prarthana hi kii ja sakati he
 o Rama can be called
 bhopal ke road sho ke vizual main bijepi adhyaksh ke taur par aaj ke grahamantri amit shah apni party ke satyagrah main shaamil hue
 If any Gandhian has seen such a scene of Satyagraha with flower garland and use of political party force, one can tweet
 is road sho main shivaraj singh chouhan bhi the
 Sadhvi Pragya did not call Gandhi's killer a patriot until the time of Amit Shah's roadshow
 lekin is road sho ke pehle sadhvi pragna kah chuki thim ki ham babari masjid kaa dhaancha todane gaye the
 i am very proud maine chadhakar dhaancha todaa tha
 God gave me strength and we have erased the stigma of the country
 sadhvi pragna ne yah bhi kaha tha ki 26-11 aatanki hamale ke shahid hemanth karkare ko deshadrohi bataaya
 Religion was told
 jis din karkare ko aatankwaadiyon ne maaraa us din sutak kaa ant ho gaya
 Pragya apologized
 maafee bhi aise maangi ki maafee sharma jaae
 i am withdrawing the statement because the enemies of the country are benefiting from it
 iske liye maafee maangati hum yah meraa nijee dukh tha
 As if apology is just a formality
 baharhaal amit shah ko aap satyagrah ke road sho main shaamil hote hue dekh sakate hai
 You must remember that the Supreme Court has given the verdict in the Ram Janmabhoomi Babri Masjid dispute that it was illegal to demolish the mosque in 1992
 to zaahir he yah ek aparaadh he
 Sadhvi Pragya calls this crime proud
 kya supreme court ke faisle ke baad is bayaan ke sandarbh main bijepi koi faisla legi? koi karrwai karegi? yah bhi sochie agar sadhvi pragna ko tikat dena itnaa bada satyagrah tha to phir unke prachaar main pradhanmantri modi kyon nahin gaye? kyon unhone duuri banaai? usee vakt jab pradhanmantri sadhvi pragna ko dil se maaf nahin karne kii baat kar rahe the bijepi ke kaaryakarta bhopal main pragna kii jeet ke liye boothon par tainaat the
 It was said not to forgive heartily and was taken support of the disciplinary committee after which he was forgiven
 godse ko deshbhakt bataane ke baad raksha samiti se hataa diya gaya
 What a punishment this is
 april 2017 main bambe hai court ne maalegaanv bam dhamaake maamle main sadhvi pragna ko zamaanat di thi
 On two grounds
 swasthya or na chal paane ke kaaran or aties or enie kii chargeshit kii satyata sandigdh hone ke kaaran
 There is a change in this case after 2014
 abhiyojan paksh yani sarkari vakil rohinee sanyaal ne press se kaha tha ki unhen enie ke afasar ne milakar kaha tha ki maalegaanv ke aropiyon ke maamle main naram pad jaaen
 Then in June 2015, Rohini Sanyal said that the same officer again said that he was being replaced by another lawyer
 godse ko deshbhakt banane kii dhara sirf pragna tak simit nahin he
 On October 2, Prime Minister Modi was writing an editorial on Gandhi Jayanti in the New York Times and Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat was describing Gandhi as great in India's newspapers, Godse was trending on Twitter
 kaayade se ye puri tarah het spich tha
 But Twitter did not take any action
 kareeb ek lakh tak twit kiye gaye
 Who were the people who were tweeting on Goddess Amar's Gandhi Jayanti day? These people were not so ignorant
 is tarah kaa twit karne vaale kai logon ne apane profile main modi kaa fain, bijepi kaa sadsy or sangh kaa samarthak bataaya tha
 Was told a supporter of Ram temple
 beshak bijepi aise logon se sambandh nahin bataaegi lekin hairaani kii baat he ki zyaadaatar khud ko sangh, bijepi or modi ji kaa fain bataane main sankoch nahin karte hai
 Even today, Dun Dun Pragya is trending on Twitter
 twit kar rahe hai ki aapke kehane se ab gandhivadi to nahin honge
 May Godse remain immortal
 godse ke saath saavarkar amar rahe kaa bhi naaraa laga he
 It is clear that the section that considers Godse as an immortal hero is the one whose leaders are forced to condemn
 ab dekhie ye ritu hai apane twitor handle kii profile main likhti he ki himachali thakurain hai
 Sanatani is a Hindu
 udhyami hai
 There are TV debaters
 twitor par ritu ke ek lakh folor hai
 Two Union Ministers Piyush Goyal and Harsh Vardhan follow
 rajyapal tathagat roy pholo karte hai
 Ritu writes that the trend that is happening against Pragya on Twitter shows that who is controlling the social media nerit, otherwise if the devotees were controlling it then Stand with Pragya Thakur would have been the first trend
 libral jamaat ke log bharat tere tukade hon vaale ko dephend karte hai kya ham pragna ke liye khadey nahin ho sakate
 Are embarrassing
 ravi naar ko kailash vijayawargeey pholo karte hai
 He tweeted that Godse is not a terrorist
 main iske saath khadaa hota hum
 He is a patriot
 agar wo hatyara he to bhi deshbhakt he
 Ravi Nar has also tagged this tweet to the Prime Minister
 upar ke netaaon kii ninda kaa simit matlab rah jaataa he
 If they are really serious about this, then their supporters will have to deal with this section
 kya piyush goyal vaise logon ko anpholo kar sakate hai jo godse ke samarthan main trend kar rahe hai? kya bijepi or aar es es aisa karne kii himmat dikhaa paaenge
 The condemnation is not just for the New York Times
 aap in netaaon ke samarthakon ke twitor handle par jaakar dekhie to godse or pragna thakur ke liye kitna samarthan he
 This truth cannot be ignored
 yah vivaad pehle bhi ho chukaa tha iske baad bhi loksabhaa main sadhvi pragna ne di em ke saansad e raja ko bich main tokkar godse ko deshbhakt kaha
 After this, there was an uproar, then Defense Minister Rajnath Singh said that far from telling Godse, we only condemn the idea of being considered a patriot
 gandhi hamaare humlog ke adarsh hai or bhavishya main bhi maardarshak rahenge
 With such clarity and honesty, no one condemned the ideology that considered Godse a hero
 rajnath singh ne amit shah kii tarah pragna ko tikat dene ko satyagrah nahin kaha
 Sadhvi Pragya is not the only one to speak out in support of Godse
 isliye unke khilaaf karrwai kaa aanshik matlab hi rah jaataa he
 The Jamaat is much larger than the statement of one or two leaders
 aaj godse ke samarthan main kehane vaale vahi log hai jo kisi or sandarbh main hindutv ke naam par unheen netaaon kaa samarthan kar rahe hai jo sadhvi pragna ke bayaan se naaraaz ho gaye
 Look at this contradiction and see that Gandhi is on the picture of the schemes, but Godse's supporters are now more than ever in the public space
 bijepi gandhi sankalp yatra nikaal rahi he
 Sadhvi Pragya was also not involved in this
 saaf saaf kah diya ki ve prachaar main yakeen nahin karti
 It is obvious that the Gandhi Sankalp Yatra is not on the road, but the BJP needs to evacuate among its supporters

 dharne ke liye mashhoor kejariwal kii dilli main unheen ke voter bhukh hadtaal par baith gaye hai
 Faced with the lack of water in Baljeet Nagar in Delhi, people have started a hunger strike, following the footsteps of their own Chief Minister
 maamla patel nagar se jude balajit nagar kaa he
 Where people are not getting water even for 24 minutes in 24 hours
 bhukh hadtaal par baithe logon kaa kahana he ki yah sirf 24 ghante kii sankethik hadtaal he, lekin dilli sarkaar ne unki pani kii samasya ko dur nahin kiya to vah anischitkaaleen bhukh hadtaal par baith jaaenge
 It is also interesting that Delhi BJP workers and local leaders also joined the common people in this hunger strike to support the common people and RWA
 yahaan se is ilaake se vidhayak aam aadmi party kaa he, or nigam parshad bijepi se he
 Due to the lack of coordination between the leaders of the two parties, the problem of water has taken such a formidable form
 bhukh hadtaal par baithe log yun hi yah karne ke liye majaboor nahin hue hai, unka kahana he ki pichley 4 maheene se vah tamaam netaaon or jal board ke chakkar lagaakar thak chuke hai
 Many times write complaint letters but not a single answer has been received
 aam logon ko lagata he ki unki bhukh hadtaal par mukhyamantri gaur karenge, kyonki bhukh hadtaal karte-karte hi arvind kejariwal mukhyamantri ban gaye hai
 So maybe we should go on hunger strike and force the government to find a solution to our water problem

 bharat ke most wonted aatanki or jaish-e-mohammad ke sargana moulana masood ajahar ke marane kii khabar se bharat main khushi kii lahar he
 But the news of the death of Masood Azhar, the merchant of death, can also be a hoax
 kyonki pakistan sarkaar or iesai pulavama hamale ke baad se lagaataar nishane par the
 International pressure and strong evidence of India became a problem for him
 pakistan kii is chaal ke peeche chaar baaten ho sakati hai
 1
 PAK ne masood ko kiya underground!aatank ke aakaa masood ajahar kii maut kii khabar puri duniya main teji faili
 This news spread on social media after seeing it
 bharat main twitor par top main trend main karne lagi
 But it is difficult to believe the news of the sudden death of terrorist Masood Azhar
 pulavama hamale or air strike ke baad pakistan sarkaar or iesai ne badhate dabaav ke kaaran khud hi aatanki masood ajahar ko underground kar diya ho, is baat kii ashanka bahut zyada he
 2
 masooj ajahar kii maut kaa drama!aatanki masood ajahar ko lekar har taraf se pakistan par hamale ho rahe the
 He was also under increasing pressure to take action against Masood
 isi dauraan bharat ne pakistan ko wo dogier bhi saunpa, jisamen pulavama hamale main jaish kaa haath hone ke pukhta saboot the
 Therefore, Pakistan's helpless and helpless government created the drama of Maulana Masood Azhar's death to spread confusion in the world
 ek sajeesh ke tahat pehle baqayada uske aspataal main bhartee hone kii khabar ai or phir achaanak uski maut ko viral kar diya gaya
 3
 paak ne khud masood ko lagaaya thikaane!bharat ne pakistan ko dogier saunp kar jaish-e-mohammad ko benakaab kar diya
 Put all the evidence of Pulwama attack in front of Pakistan
 isse pehle masood kaa aatanki sanghathan bharat main kai bade hamale kar chukaa he
 Due to which the dual character of Pakistan has been exposed
 un hamalon or sajishon ke tamaam saboot bharat ne duniya ke saamne rakhe or aatanki mulk kaa asli cheharaa duniya ko dikhaaya
 It is believed that Pakistan and ISI used to use Masood, the master of terror, to spread terror, but after exposing his misdeeds, he overcame them
 ashanka he ki paak ne khud hi masood ajahar ko thikaane laga diya he

 balakot air strike main maaraa gaya masood!pakistan kii sarkaar sena or iesai ke saamne bebas or laachaar najar aati he
 The government runs not only Imran Khan but the army and ISI
 aise main ashanka ye bhi he ki balakot main bhartiya vaayu sena kii air strike main aatanki sargana masood ajahar maaraa gaya ho
 But Pakistan is trying to hide the news
 kyonki abhi tak bhi pakistan is baat inkaar kar rahaa he ki balakot main aatanki thikaane the
 Or they have been destroyed by the Indian Air Force
 ashanka he ki masood ke maare jane ke baad hi paak sarkaar ne uski beemaari kii juthi khabar failaai ho
 And then suddenly announced that he was killed due to illness
 uske air strike main maare jane kii pushti karnaa pakistan ke liye badi musiibat ban saktaa he
 Let me tell you that on the night of 26 February, 12 Mirage planes of the Indian Air Force entered Pakistan and destroyed the jaish-e-mohammed's bases in Balakot
 sarkaar ke mutabik is hamale main kai aatanki or unke commander maare gaye the
 However, till now the Government of Pakistan has kept silence
 aatanki sanghathan jaish-e-mohammad ne bhi abhi tak koi pratikriya jari nahin kii he
 Although the news is also that terrorist Masood Azhar is still alive, but the Pakistani government has hidden it somewhere

 Hillary shouted in response, "we are not at war with Islam" rajendra yadav nahin rahe
 It is surprising to think that they are no more
 do-chaar din pehle tak vah insaan hamaare bich tha
 a few days ago, he had visited my house with a few friends in the den
 ek marun rang kaa kurta or jhini safed dhoti pahanakar aae the
 People often stop wearing colorful clothes as they get older, but Rajendra never observed such rites
 ve hameshaa chatkh hare, laal, nile yaa bangnee rang ke kapade pahante the
 That day at my house, they drank alcohol, ate food, fought gossip
 log kehete the ki ve bahut biimaar chal rahe hai par maine unhen kabhi biimaar nahin dekha
 He had diabetes
 hajaaron logon ko hota he par unki sugar aniyantrit nahin thi
 Just like people usually get broken on seeing alcohol or food, they never eat and drink like this
 unamem asaadhaaran sanyam tha
 Wherever you live, outside or at home, how much to drink, how much food to eat, when to take insulin, how many cigarettes to inhale, when to sleep, it was all set like a thorn in a clock
 dekhakar badi hairaani hoti thi
 Following this rule can be done by very few people
 ek cigarette ke do tukade karne ke baad ve aadha tukdaa pite the
 Many times asked him to smoke the whole cigarette
 ye kahkar ki koi bada nuksaan nahin hoga, par unhone aadhe tukade se zyada kabhi nahin pi
 As much as everyone was worried about their lungs, were their lungs really as bad? Whenever she asked him, "how is your health?" He would say, "great
" ’’ tabiyat kharaab he yaa falaan rog se pareshaan hai, aisi baaten ve kabhi apane munh par nahin laate the
 Once went to see him at his Mayur Vihar house
 pataa chalaa hernia hua he, lete hue hai
 He kept talking lately, narrating stories about life
 beemaari ko lekar hai-hai karnaa, avsaad main ghire rahanaa, yah sab rajendra ji main bilkul nahin tha
 Always used to laugh
 jinda rahane main unhone koi kotahi nahin kii
 He was 84 years old
 abhi or jinda rah sakate the par mysive heart atake hone par or kya kiya ja saktaa he! koi bhi chalaa jaataa he
 The best thing that happened was that Rajendraji did not have to suffer much
 dinodin, saalo-saal bistar par pade-pade karaahna nahin padaa
 Thankfully, Rajendra ji did not get the same kind of life
 jis raat unka dehanth hua, us raat saadhe teen baje main unke ghar pahunchi
 i noticed that in the drawing room outside where the sofa used to be, they are lying in a wonderful steel box
 unki beti rachana paas hi kursi par baithi ro rahi thi
 i stared for a long time staring at his naked body
 rajendra ji ko kabhi sote hue nahin dekha tha
 He seemed to be sleeping
 phir laga ki jaise unki saans chal rahi ho
 Continually stared for a long time
 agar jaraa bhi unke saans lene kaa abhas mil jaae to!itani yathartwaadee hone ke baavjood bhi main aaj bhi maut ko maan nahin paati hum
 My mother passed before me
 pitaaji kii mrityu ke samay main vahaan nahin thi
 The government of my country did not even let me go to see Dad once in his last time
 rajendra ji jis tarah lete hue the, ho saktaa he mere pitaaji bhi vaise hi lete hue hon
 Seemed that maybe they are sleeping
 jaise achaanak shor-sharabe se ve jaag jaaenge
 But my father did not wake up from sleep
 rajendra ji bhi neend se nahin jage
 We who are alive, who are still bereaved for Rajendra ji, one day we will all die likewise
 par hamamen se kitne log ji paaenge, rajendra ji jaisaa vividh jivan
 He always held a gathering of intellectual people at his home
 us mehfil main har umr kii mahila va purush hote
 He used to spend time with talented young men and young women
 jinke saath ve vichaaron kaa aadan-pradaan karte, unhen likhane kaa utsaah dete the
 He gave more importance to women's life experiences, their protests, their attitudes and their language
 ve andheron ko tatolkar hiron ke chote-chote tukade been laate the
 Ever since i was expelled from Bengal, i started living in Delhi permanently, when the Bengali magazines and magazines shrank themselves out of fear
 sivaa mere sabko chhapane kaa adhikaar tha, yahaan tak ki jansatta ne bhi jab mere lekhon ko bahut painaa kahkar khaarij kar diya, tab rajendra ji ne mujhe apni patrika hans ke liye niyamit rup se likhane ke liye kaha
 Like other editors, he never told me to condemn religion, call the government bad, say Indian traditions, or say harsh things about religious babes
 kisi bhi vishay main, kuch bhi likhane kii swatantraaa di thi rajendra ji ne mujhe
 The editors of other journals run away saying are-re-re
 dharm kii kisi bhi tarah kii aalochana koi nahin bardaasht karata he
 They cut the article, otherwise they will destroy it by using censor scissors
 rajendra ji ne mere kisi bhi lekh ko apriy satya rahane ke aparaadh main khaarij nahin kiya
 She did not use scissors
 ve thik meri tarah bolne kii aazaadee par 100 fisadi vishwaas karte the
 Rajendra ji was quite old
 par usase kya? ve bahut hi aadhunik insaan the
 More modern and most free-minded humans than the young boys and girls who surrounded them
 kuch samay pehle unhone hans patrika ke vaarshik utsav main gaalib auditorium main ‘‘abhivyakti kii swatantraaa’’ ko lekar ek bade kaarykram kaa aayojan kiya tha
 It was decided that i would speak there but due to security reasons i finally could not go there
 kaarykram ke bich se unhone kai baar mujhe phone kiya
 Very requested
 is baat par ve bilkul vishwaas nahin karte the ki mujhe maarane ke liye chaaron taraf musalmaan kattarpanthi taiyaar baithe hai
 i also do not
 ab abhi bhi logon kii bheed dekhte hi, yaadon kaa ek vibhats jhund mujhe jakad letaa he
 At any given time, any fanatic will do anything
 or yah dhakka na sambhaal paane par agar sarkaar bol baithe ki desh chodo
 i have lost Bengal
 bharat ko khone kaa dard main nahin sah paaungi
 Here the security personnel again cautioned me not to go to any platform in the midst of the crowd
 rajendra ji ne mujhe kaarykram main jane kaa aamantran diya tha
 i also promised that i will go
 par main unki baat rakh na saki
 He was very hurt
 kaarykram ke nimantran patr par ve meraa naam dena chaahate the
 i requested not to be named
 kaha tha ki achaanak hi aa jaaoongi
 He spoke to me and did not mention my name on the invitation card
 unhen vishwaas tha ki abhivyakti kii swatantraaa par meraa vaktavy moolyawaan hoga
 i was deported due to writing
 bangla patr-patrikaon main main ek nishiddh naam hum
 Many books are banned
 meri kitabon par pratibandh lagane or mujhe mrityudand dene ke liye shahar main lakhon logon kaa juluus niklaa tha
 Rajendraji wanted to honor the same forbidden person in the last program of his life
 nishiddh lekhak ko dekhakar, duusare lekhakon ko, buddhijiviyon ko, dar se dur jate dekha he, par rajendra ji phulon kii maala haathon main lekar aage aae the
 Rajendraji was definitely the most different
 rajendra ji ko lekar aakhri dinon main maine tarah-tarah kii baaten suni thim
 Jyoti Kumari, a girl from Bihar, gave her a job, writing opportunities and facilities
 uski kitaab prakashit karwaane main madad kii or laad-dulaar main use sir par chadha liya tha
 In the meantime, some such incidents happened that various disputes started to arise
 jyoti kumari or rajendra ji ko lekar log tarah-tarah kii ashobhaneey baaten kehane lage
 On the other hand, people from other parties kept saying that the girl was not good
 is purushatantric desh main ladakiyon ke bare main buree baaten bolne vaale logon kii kami nahin he
 i could not blame a person like Rajendra ji by listening to the words of outsiders, or even after hearing the words of people, that girl could not say "she is not a good girl"
 rajendra ji ne bahut-si ladakiyon se sneh kiya he
 Many have also loved, but without the permission of a girl, they have not pressurized or even touched her, this is not said by their enemies
 jis din mere ghar par unase meri aakhri mulaakaat hui thi, us din achaanak unhone mujhase poocha, ‘‘lekhak sunil gangopadhyaay ke viruddh mere abhiyog kii kya vajah thi?’’ maine kaha, ‘‘sunil kaa main bahut sammaan karti thi par ek din achaanak unhone meri anumati ke bina mere sharir ko chuaa tha
 It was appropriate to protest, that's why i protested
 duusari ladakiyon ke jivan main yon shoshan hone par virodh karti hum to apane jivan main ghatane par munh band karke kyon rahati?’’ rajendra ji mujhase sahamat the
 Not once did he say that it was not proper for me to complain against Sunil
 jawan yuvak-yuvatiyaan rajendra ji ko hameshaa ghere rahete
 He used to remember him with great reverence
 maine un logon ko kehete suna he ki hamane pita kho diya he
 Like Rajendra ji, the affectionate poet and writer by Rajendra, believe in free ideas
 kisi bhi apriy satya ko bolne main unhen koi hichkichaahat na ho
 Will anyone become like this? Like i did not hide anything while writing my autobiography, Rajendra ji has not hidden anything about himself in the recently written book, Sick Thoughts of a Healthy Person
 unhone apni jindagi ke bare main likhaa, apane saare sambandhon ke bare main likhaa
 He has written everything that is valid and illegal in the eyes of society
 log kya kahenge iske bare main nahin sochaa
 Will, ever, someone be as honest as them? Do all those whom they have left believe the same freedom to say their thoughts openly? dilli main choron ke hausale kis kadar buland he, uski baangi beeti raat pahadganj main hui vaardaat se pataa chalata he
 The thieves broke the shutters of four shops in a single night and stole valuables and millions of rupees of cash
 chori kii yah vaardaat sisitivi main kaid ho gai he
 The most interesting thing is that the same shop was targeted by another gang of thieves just after an hour that night
 police maamla darj kar jaanch main juty he
 But people are scared in the area due to frequent thieves
 sisitivi footage main dekha ja saktaa he ki chor pahadganj ke ek export company ke daftar main jamkar tod-phod kar rahe hai
 After stealing, the thieves distributed leisurely stolen things among themselves
 hisse baantne ke dauraan unke bich thodi gahamaa-gahami bhi hoti he
 The most interesting thing is that only one hour after these thieves leave, another gang of thieves also enters this office
 ve bhi chaaron ore keemtee saamaan talashte hai, lekin unke haath sirf ek laptop laga
 When the owner of the company opened the shop the other day, he came to know of the theft and was informed to the police
 choron ke giroh ne is daftar ke alaava usee raat usee ilaake main teen or dukaanon ke shater tode, haalanki vahaan unke haath kuch khaas nahin laga
 This theft incident has created an atmosphere of fear in the area, because the thieves have also been seen with weapons
 resident welfare association ke anusaar, pichley ek maheene main ilaake menchori kii 30 se 40 ghatnaayenho chuki hai
 The association says that every time a complaint is made to the police, there is no fear among the thieves due to lack of police patrolling and they are constantly committing theft incidents

 According to senior officials Oli is coming to India with his 53 delegations
 haalanki is daure par bharat urja or suraksha kshetra main apni aapattiyon ko nepal se jarur saajha karegaa
 It is certain that India will buy most of the power from the Arun Project
 is project ko bhutan ke saath hydropavar sahyog ke tarj par public sector kii company satluj jal vidyut nigam ke dwaara banaaya gaya he
 Under this Bhutan model, India will buy most of the power from this project itself
 sutron ke anusaar nepal ke saath bhi bharat yah niyam rakh saktaa he ki uski companiyon ko hi project mili varanaa vah china dwaara banaae gaye project se bijli nahin kharidega
 The government would like to make it clear that if Nepal gives the project to China, then it also sells electricity
 nepal ko yah hogi dikkatbharat kii is niti se nepal ko china kii ore badaye gaye apane haathon ko sametanaa pad saktaa he
 The reason is that it would be difficult to develop electricity supply in areas of China and Tibet via the Himalayas

 vishwa main aciatic sheron ke thikaane ke liye mashhoor gir ke jangalon main ab 27 saal baad baagh hone kii pushti gujarat sarkaar ke jariye kii gai he
 The tiger has been seen in CCTV installed in the forests of Lunavada in Panchmahal district
 isse gujarat kaa van vibhaag utsahit najar aa rahaa he
 a few days ago, on February 6, a teacher at the Mahisagar School in the same area, Mahesh Mehra saw a tiger near his car while passing through the village of Boriya
 sthaneey logon ne yahaan pehle bhi baagh dekhne kii baat kahi thi lekin uski pushti nahin ho paa rahi thi
 The pictures of the tiger were captured by Mahesh in his camera a few days ago, after which these pictures were given to the forest department with information
 ilaake main baagh hone kii pushtiiske baad van vibhaag ne pairon or chamadi ke mili nishaanon ke aadhaar par jaanch kii to laga ki ho saktaa he ye baagh ho
 The Forest Department has installed a micro-sensible night vision camera in this entire area to confirm this
 baad main jab camere main maujuud footage kii jaanch kii gai to usamen somvaar-mangalvaar ke darmyaan raat ek baagh ko dekha gaya
 Then the Forest Department confirmed that there was a tiger in this area
 mana ja rahaa he ki baagh akelaa haven or paryaavaran mantri ganpat vasava ke mutabik, baagh kii umr 7 se 8 varsh kii he
 This tiger is alone or its entire family is living here, it is being investigated through the forest department
 philhal ye mana ja rahaa he ki ye baagh akelaa dikhaa he
 Due to this, it is believed that this tiger may have come from Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh or Maharashtra
 yahaan se nikalate samay saavdhaanee baratane kii apilgujarat sarkaar ke jariye is baat kii jaankaree baagh ko lekar kaam karne vaali sanstha neshnal tiger conjarveshan athurity ko bhi de di gai he
 Also, the local people living here are also being informed that the tigers are in this area, take all precautions while coming from here
 27 saal baad ek baar phir dikhaa baghgauratlab he ki saal 1989 main simavarti ilaake main baagh dikhne ke baad ab phir se gujarat main baagh kii maujuudagi kii tasviir saamne ai he
 Local people are also excited after seeing the tiger once again after 27 years
 team india kaa aglaa muqabla ek aisi team se he jo he to gujarey jamaane kii world champion lekin wo aaj bhi jis match main utarati he maidan kaa maahaul rangeen bana detii he
 The force on the forehead of the front team definitely brings
 1979 main westeindies ne aakhri baar worldcup jeeta lekin aakraamakata ke maamle main aaj bhi is team kaa koi sani nahin
 Can't do anything if Gayle goes: dhonibharat started attacking cricket a little lately against West Indies but today India is ahead of the Windies in terms of performance in the last few years on the field
 donon do-do baar ke world champion hai or worldcup main donon ke bich hue muqablon kaa itihaas bhi kareeb-kareeb baraabar sa hi he
 But if we look at the performance of both the teams in this 2015 World Cup, then India looks like a favorite
 apane teenon match jitkar bharat is match main utarane vaala he to westeindies apane 4 maichon main se do harkar
 One of which was against Ireland
 worldcup ke chir pratidwandvi rahe bharat-westeindies ke bich hone vaala ye muqabla kin myanon main hoga khaas aaiye nazar daalate hai
 
 
 History is the team that prevented West Indies from becoming world champions for the first time, with India being the winner of 1975 and 1979
 iske baad hue world cap muqablon main bhi kabhi westeindies haaavee rahaa to kabhi bharat ne jeet kaa paracham laharaaya
 In total, the two teams clashed 7 times in the World Cup, of which 4 matches were won by India and three by the West Indies
 yahi nahin donon tiimon ke pichley 10 van-de maichon kaa pradarshan bhi bharat ko bees sabit karata he
 India has won 6 of the last 10 One Day matches and lost only three
 ek match benatija rahaa
 While the West Indies have won only 3 out of 10 matches, they have lost in 7 matches
 saal 2010 ke baad se to westeindies kii team bharat ke saamne sangharsh hi kar rahi he
 The two have played 20 odis since 2010, out of which India has beaten the West Indies in 14 and beat the Windies in 6 matches
 gail banaam team indise match ko kris gail banaam team india ke taur par bhi dekha ja rahaa he lekin gail par westeindies kii had se zyada nirbharta bhi unke liye musiibat kaa sabab ban sakati he
 The match in which Gayle runs his team wins that match easily but the match in which his bat does not speak, his team is also silent in that match
 har match main westeindies kii ranneeti kaa tanabana gail ke ird-gird hi buna jaataa he
 When Sachin Tendulkar was in Team India, the situation of India was also like this, but despite this, Indian cricket produced many stars who could turn the match on their own
 maujuuda team india kii bhi yahi khaasiyat he
 How Holders Will Combat Dhoni On one side, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, whose strategies are full of cricket fraternity, on the other hand Jason Holder, who might not even be recognized if he is told that he is the captain of the West Indies in the World Cup
 mahaj 30 vanade maichon kaa anubhav rakhane vaale holder bharat ke vishwavijeta captain kaa muqabla kaise kar paaenge, ye is mukaable main dekhnaa hoga
 It is true that his team also has senior players like Chris Gayle, Darren Sammy and Marlon Samuels to advise them, but Dhoni can still be overwhelming in terms of captaincy
 khaskar worldcup jaise bade stage par captaini karne kaa dhoni kaa anubhav team india ko westeindies ke khilaaf majboot bataa rahaa he
 If Team India wins in this match, then Dhoni will also equal the record of the Indian captain Kapil Dev who won the most in World Cup
 perth main bharat abhyastayuai ke khilaaf bharat ko perth ke maidan par badi jeet mili
 And along with the victory, there was a chance to accuse himself on Perth's bouncy pitch
 jis wicket par worldcup se pehle hui tri siries main bharat sangharsh kar rahaa tha, usee wicket par yuai ko haraane ke baad team india kaa aatmavishvaas badha hua he
 But for the first time West Indies will play on the Perth wicket in this World Cup
 aise main yahaan bhi phayda team india ko miltaa dikhaai de rahaa he

 Moto x Original, Mioto x 2nd Generation and Moto x Style i have used these three smartphones quite a lot and out of which Moto x Original was my favorite too

 Build quality is solid and seems to be premium
 motorola ke smartfones durable hote hai or ise bhi aap durable phone maan sakate hai, kyonki company ne ise puri tarah se premium banane kii koshish kii he
 It is a glass-backed smartphone based on an aluminum frame that leaves no stone unturned to make it premium
 yah phone slee he, lekin iskaa vajan saadhaaran se zyada he
 Since the glass is back, there will be finger prints on its rear panel, so it is better to use it in a clear case
 haalanki bina rier cover ke hi agar aap ise yuj karenge to hold karne main koi pareshaani nahin hogi
 The right side of the phone has three buttons, a volume rocker while a lock button
 front main disple ke upar yearpys ke ek taraf front camera he jabaki duusari taraf front flash modul diya gaya he
 The bottom has USB type-c and Micro USB jack
 duusare smartphone kii tarah yahaan aapako spikar gril nahin milegaa
 Because the company has also provided the speaker in the earpiece itself
 antena lines aapako dikhte nahin hai kyonki ages par hi die gaye hai
 Overall, its design and build quality meets your expectations and is superb
 displexnoto X4 main 5
 The 2-inch full HD display is given, the company has used IPS
 agar is range main company ne OLED diya hota to or bhi behatar hota
 The display is bright and you will not have any problem in continuous viewing

 disple ke maamle main yah krantikari nahin kaha ja saktaa he, lekin isaki disple nishchit taur par everej se upar he or ise yuj karnaa ek acha anubhav rahaa he
 Performance Moto X4 has 3GB RAM with Qualcomm Snapdragon 630 processor
 yah procesar apane segment kaa best procesar nahin he isliye kabhi-kabhi aapako dikkaton kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he
 However, the stock given in this smartphone is Android, which is known for good processing even at low RAM cost
 heavi gaming kar sakate hai Asphalt kaa letest adishan bhi khel sakate hai isamen hang nahin karata he
 But if you have opened some apps in the background of this game, which is constantly taking up memory, then in such a situation there is a problem
 isamen diya gaya fingerprint scinar kaaphi fast he or palak jhapakate hi aap iske jariye apana phone analock kar sakate hai
 There is no problem in internet web browsing, apps do not lag and there is no problem in transitioning from one app to another

 This smartphone has some preloaded apps and features of Motorola which will prove to be very beneficial for you in everyday life
 inamen moto kii, moto acshan, moto disple or wais jaise fitures shaamil hai jo company ke apane hai
 We told you about the Moto Display in the Display section itself
 moto acshan ek shandaar feechar he jahaan aapako apane smartphone se jescher ke jariye interact karne kaa opshan miltaa he
 Whether to take screenshots, put the phone on silent mode or make the screen smaller and turn on the flashlight
 in sab task ke liye aap hand jescher kaa sahaara le sakate hai
 It also has a twist camera gesture
 yah feechar sirf paper par nahin hai, balki ye sateek hai or kaaphi behatar kaam karte hai or ise roj yuj bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 Apart from this, there is also Talk to me feature which was in Moto x Style and this feature was my personal favorite, because through this you can interact better without touching your smartphone
 is smartphone kii parformens aapako niraashan hin karti he
 But still it is not the best, according to this segment it can be called solid
 cameraonoto X4 kii khaasiyaton main se ek isamen diya gaya dual camera seoup he

 For this, you will see a special button in the camera interface
 kam raushnee yani indor photography shandaar nahin he, lekin ise aivarej kaha ja saktaa he
 The camera interface is not slow and the photos do not take much time to process which is a good thing
 der tak photography karne se hamane iske camera shater main lag mahasoos kiye hai
 Water Resistant Moto X4 is a water resistant smartphone with an IP68 rating
 yani aap ise 1
 If kept under water even for 5 meters and half an hour, it will not spoil
 hamane ise test kiya he jisamen yah smartphone company ke daawey ke mutabik khara utarataa he
 There was no change in response rate during tap water testing and even after that it works properly
 yani aap ise baari barish main istemaal kar sakate hai
 Smartphones in this range have a rating of water resistant, but its rating is better
 Google Pixel 2 yaa phir iphone 8 ko udhaaharan ke taur par le len to water testing main Moto X4 kaa palada baari he
 Battery Moto X4 gives you a 3,000mah battery
 fast charging kaa opshan he or hamane ise lagbhag 43 minute main 0 se 84 fisadi tak charge kiya he

 ek intellegencia, doosraa komanman
 Tulsidas had written that Lokhun Bedn Aan Upai
 itani bhashaaen, itane dharm, har koi apane hisaab se jeene ko swatantra
 This diversity is what has been the power of Hinduism and that is why it has been able to serve for so long
 jain dharm ne anekantwaad ko mana, isliye jain yahaan bache rah gaye
 This thing should be kept in mind
 chrischiyanity main, islam main ek ishwar, ek kitaab
 The British also valued this diversity of ours
 khud (jorge abraham) grearsan ne linguistic survey of india ke tahat desh bhar kii bhashaaon kaa survey kiya or bataaya ki itani bhashaaen or boliyaan or kahin nahin
 How many dialects are there in Hindi alone
 yahaan hindutv bhi do prakaar kaa he
 One belongs to the RSS
 ab to ve sarkaar main bhi aa gaye hai, lekin mukhya dhara nahin ban sake
 Real Hinduism gives us vastness like the sea
 hindu janmajaat hota he, hindu banaaya nahin jaataa
 We did not make anyone Hindu, born Hindu
 aresas waalon kaa hindutv political hindutv he
 Say "namaste Sada Vatsale Matrubhoome" and what do we do for the motherland? The openness of Hindutva, that is freedom, we should protect it
 unke propeganda kii kaat yahi he ki ham apni aatma ko surakshit rakhen
 The Varna system emerged as the biggest weakness of Hinduism

 But the greatest revolution occurred during the Bhakti era

 The first revolt was done by the Buddha and the second by the Bhakti movement

 Literature and various arts have played a big role in this

 They are our cultural heritage
 uthal-puthal vaale daur main mukhya dhara ko kya karnaa chahie? mukhya dhara ko samvaad band nahin karnaa chahie
 We should not have Islam and Christian fundamentalism
 sufiyon ne bhi aakhir vidroh kiya or vah puri kii puri sufi parampara maulaviyon ke khilaaf jaati he
 The Bhakti movement did that work in us
 phir bhaaratendu (harishchandra) se renesaan kaa daur shuru hota he
 So one thing is that we have preserved our tradition
 jab log likhnaa nahin jaanate the, to yaad karne kii parampara thi
 The Vedas were remembered at all
 phir lekhan kala ai, mudran aayaa, phir tepe recorder aa gaya
 Full voice only tap
 yah bhi yaad rakhie, parampara ek din main nahin banati
 This is prepared in a phased manner
 jaahir he, ham koi nausikhue desh nahin hai
 Two such civilizations have such a long history: India and China
 africa kii kinhin jatiyon kaa ho to ho, par vahaan lekhan kii chunki parampara nahin thi, to kuch saamne nahin aa paaya
 All that was kept in our Vedas

 It is not a country but a sub-continent

 God is not one of us
 yah vividhta hamaari badi puunji he
 The heart and mind of this country is still not closed
 sankat aate rahe hai par kaha he naa ki kuch baat he ki hasti mitati nahin hamaari
 Here we should be proud of the diversity of language, art, aesthetics at every level
 lekin garv ke saath-saath use surakshit bhi rakhana hoga kyonki us par khatra mandara rahaa he
 Hitler did something similar
 khatra ye he ki jo shaktiyaan is desh kii bahulata ke viruddh ekaatmata par bal de rahi hai, sanyog se unheen kii party power main he

 mehul kumaar ne amitabh bachchan ke saath film 'koharaam' or 'mrityudaata', rajkumaar ke saath 'jangbaaz' or 'tirangaa', naanaa patekar kii 'krantivir' jaisi kai badi filmein bade se bade sitaron ke saath banaai hai, magar ab vah film bananaa chhod gujarati or marathi dharawahik banaate hai
 Has opened multiplexes to grow its business
 jab hamane mehul kumaar se film chhodane kii vajah poochi to unhone sabase pehle corporate housees ko zimmedaar tehraaya or kaha ki aaj sitare corporate ke saath kaam karnaa chaahate hai, kyonki ve bahut zyaada paise dete hai
 More films flop, yet they are not affected, because the public has money
 yah baat bhi sahi he ki aaj ke vakt main karan johar or sajid nadianwala jaise ikkaa-dukka hi nirmaataa bache hai, baaki sab corporate ho chukaa he or karan johar jaise nirmaataa bhi isliye chal rahe hai kyonki kisi bade star se unki dosti he, jiske saath ek badi film banaate hai or 3 chote sitaron ke saath or sabhi filmon kaa sauda corporate house ke saath ho jaataa he
 Mehul Kumar believes that nowadays the stars have increased a lot and more producers are doing similar work
 yahaan tak ki ab stars ke paas pahunchane ke liye maheenon lagate hai, kyonki unke bijnes manager maheenon-maheenon tahlaate hai or darjanon i-mail mangavate hai
 Mehul Kumar's point cannot be denied, as it is also true that the arrival of corporate houses has closed the shops of dozens of such big manufacturers

 In this Test match, if the performance of both the teams is seen, there is no doubt that the England team performed well in every department of the game
 siries main ab chaar test match bache hai
 There is also pressure on Team India to avenge the previous defeat
 aise main viraat team ko apane pradarshan ke str ko ooncha uthaanaa hoga
 Only then England can be conquered
 oping jodi ko banani hogi ek badi saajhedarigautam gambhir or murali vijay kii salaami jodi kaa pradarshan behad kharaab rahaa
 The pair added just 68 runs in the first innings
 to duusari pari main ye jodi ek bhi ran nahin jod saki
 Although Vijay played a century of just 126 runs in the first innings
 lekin gautam ke pradarshan main gambhirtha najar nahin dikhi
 Gambhir scored 23 and 0 in two innings of this test
 kisi bhi mukaable ko jeetne ke liye opening jodi kaa acha pradarshan kar behad jaruri he
 Apart from this, the fielding of the Indian team was also in question
 kai kaich chode gaye
 The Indian team also had to bear the brunt
 middle order bhi ladkadayapahali pari main murali vijay kaa shatak, viraat kohli kii 40 ranon kii pari or aar aswin ke behtareen 70 ranon kii badaulat team india ne ek bada score to jarur khadaa kiya
 But India's batting in the second innings was completely in question
 captain viraat kohli ko chhod koi bhi ballebaaj england ke gendbaajon ke saamne tik nahin sakaa
 Ajinkya Rahane's form is definitely drawing worry lines on the forehead of Team India's think tank
 bhartiya gendbaajon ko apane pradarshan main sudhaar laana hogarakot kii wicket spin gendbaajon ke liye madadgaar thi or aswin and company se phir se shandaar pradarshan kii ummid thi
 But they could not do anything for Team India's spinners
 lekin england ke yuva spinners ne bhartiya ballebaajon ke hosh thikaane jarur laga die
 In this Test match, England spin bowler Adil Rashid took the maximum seven wickets
 jabaki behtareen spinneron main se ek aar aswin, rabindra jadeja or amit mishra jaise gendbaaj ek-ek wicket lene ke liye jhujhate rahe
 However, the first test match was drawn
 lekin england ke khilaaf team india kii ye rahaa kisi bhi lihaaj se aasaan nahin hone vaali he
 Captain Virat Kohli and coach Anil Kumble will need to consider fresh strategy

 Trinamool Congress Party leader and Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said on Monday that we have decided to completely regularize all lands (refugee settlements), as it has been a long time now

 rajya sarkaar pehle hi un 94 rifuji coloniyon ko regularise kar chuki he jo rajya kii jameen par bani hui he
 Efforts will be made to regularize the residential settlements built on private land and central government land
 mamata kaa kahana he ki visthapit logon ko bhi jameen kaa adhikaar hona chahie
 Mamata Banerjee's statement came at a time when the Center is being asked to implement the National Register of Citizens (NRC) across the country
 mamata banerjee enarasi ko lekar lagaataar bayaan de rahi hai or unka kahana he ki ise apane rajya main lagu nahin hone dengi
 TMC rescuing illegal immigrants: BJP however, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders allege that the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) in the state is trying to save illegal immigrants from Bangladesh as they are the party's main vote bank
 rajya ke bijepi netaaon kaa kahana he enarasi puure rajya main lagu hona chahie
 After the cabinet meeting, Mamta Banerjee said that the state government has already decided to regularize 94 refugee settlements built on state land
 lekin abhi bhi kai sharnaarthi bastiyaan aisi hai jo centre sarkaar or nijee partiyon ke adheen hai or unhen regularise karaae janaa chahie

 The Indian post was fired for about 20 minutes, which is seen as giving cover fire to the terrorists trying to infiltrate

 The Pakistani army also continued to fire to help these terrorists trying to infiltrate
 uski koshish thi ki sena aatankwaadiyon ke shav baraamad na kar paae
 Pakistan is doing this so that its pole does not open once again, because the material recovered from the terrorists in the attack in Uri battalion headquarters has become the bone of Pakistan's throat

 They fired indiscriminately at the soldiers and threw grenades

 ghuspaith kii koshish kar rahe in aatankwaadiyon kii madad ke liye pakistani sena bhi lagaataar golibari karti rahi
 His attempt was that the army could not recover the bodies of the terrorists
 pakistan aisa isliye kar rahaa he taaki uski pole ek baar phir na khul jaae, kyonki uri batalian headquarters main hue hamale main aatankiyon se baraamad saamaan pakistan ke gale kii haddi ban gaya he
 Significantly, on Sunday, four Pakistani terrorists from across the border attacked the army base
 unhone javaanon par andhadhundh firing kii or grenade phenke
 All four terrorists were killed after a grueling three-hour encounter
 is hamale main 18 jawan shahid ho gaye the
 India has directly blamed Pakistan for the Uri attack and on Monday the government has decided to try to isolate Pakistan internationally

 jammu-kashmir ke pulavama main aantki hamale ke baad desh main shok or gusse kaa maahaul he
 Everyone is demanding the Modi government to give a strong reply to Pakistan
 vahiin bharat sarkaar ne sakht kadam uthaate hue pakistan se vyapaar main MFN yani most faverd nesan kaa darja waapas lene kaa elaan kiya he
 After this announcement, now the Commerce Ministry will soon notify the World Trade Organization (WTO) about its decision
 ek adhikari ne isaki jaankaree di he
 The official said the ministry will inform the WTO about withdrawal of the Most Favored Nation status given to Pakistan, citing Article 21 of the WTO
 iske alaava mantralay kii ore se pakistan se aane vaale product kii ek suchi taiyaar kii jaaegi
 India will increase customs duty on all these products
 kya he most faverd neshnaunthan yani most faverd nesan ke tahat aane vaale desh ko kai suvidhaayen mil jaatin hai
 At the same time there is a sense of security on the business front
 masalan, pakistan ko adhik aayaat kota or kam trade tarriff miltaa he
 At the same time, Pakistan was confident that under no circumstances would India harm the economic front
 1996 main bharat ne diya tha darjabharat ne 1996 main pakistan ko most faverd nesan kaa darja diya tha
 At the same time, despite assuring Pakistan, India has not yet given this status
 bharat ne jammu-kashmir ke uri atake ke baad pehali baar pakistan ke MFN darje ko lekar bharat ne rivyuu kiya tha
 In fact, as a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO), each country gives each other the status of Most Favored Nation
 haalanki yah darja dena anivaary nahin hota he
 Explain that the total trade of india-pakistan is 2 in 2016-17
 27 arab dollar tha jo maamuli badhat ke baad 2017-18 main 2
 41 billion dollars
 bharat ne 2017-18 main 48
 Had imported 8 million dollars while 1
 92 arab dollar kaa niryaat kiya tha
 The items imported from Pakistan mainly include fruits, cement, petroleum products, mineral resources, iron ore and finished leather
 jabaki pakistan se niryaat hone vaale item main kaccha kapaas, sooti dhaage, daai, rasayan or plastic shaamil hai
 What the experts of the trade expert market say that this decision will not have any significant impact on the bilateral trade of the country because the business between the two countries is less than three billion dollars annually
 jaankaron ke mutabik pakistan is maamle main bharat ko dablutio kii vivaad niptaan vyavastha main ghaseet saktaa he
 However, Pakistan's arguments will not last long
 darasal, pakistan ne bharat ko most faverd nesan kaa darja nahin diya he
 This is why his side will be weak

 bollywood ke mashhoor film nirdeshak kamaal amrohi kaa janm 17 janvari 1918 ko upi ke amroha main hua tha
 He was very strict in nature
 unhone apane kariyar ke dauraan keval 5 filmon kaa hi nirdesan kiya
 Kamal wrote the dialogues for the movie mughal-e-azam
 kamaal amrohi or minaa kumari kii prem kahani kaaphi charchit rahi
 Meena Kumari started working in films from a very young age
 mahaj 7 saal kii umr se hi ve filmon main aa gai thim
 Kamal Amrohi was very impressed with his performance
 ve unhen apni film main lenaa chaahate the, lekin unke sakht swabhaav ke kaaran minaa ne unke saath film main kaam nahin kiya
 But due to pressure from father, Meena Kumari had to film
 film to nahin ban saki, lekin kamaal amrohi, minaa kumari ke diwane jarur ho gaye
 Meena Kumari also acknowledged his love
 magar donon kii shaadi honi mushkil thi kyonki kamaal pehle se hi shaadishuda thim
 Later, when the love between the two grew, it became difficult to live without marriage
 minaa ke pita is shaadi ke sakht khilaaf the
 But Kamal's friend persuaded Meena to say that she should perform the nikah and that she would convince abba-ammi at the right time
 14 farvari, 1952 ko donon kaa nikaah ho gaya
 The story of Kamal Amrohi and Meena Kumari's marriage is also interesting
 do ghante ke bheetar donon kaa nikaah hua tha
 In fact, in the clinic where Meena was undergoing physiotherapy, father Ali Baksh used to leave Meena daily at eight o'clock with her sister Madhu and reach him at ten o'clock
 14 farvari 1952 ko isi do ghante ke dauraan minaa kaa nikaah plan kiya gaya tha
 Kamal and Meena's marriage was never accepted by their families
 aakhirkaar isse tang aakar kamaal ne minaa ko khat main likh diya ki ve is shaadi ko ek haadasa maan len
 In response, Meena said that he could never understand them, nor would understand them further, it would be better to divorce them
 mana jaataa he ki minaa kumari kii shoharat dekh kar kamaal unase jalane lage the
 The relationship between the two continued to grow sour
 31 march 1972 ko minaa kumari ne duniya ko alavida kaha
 On 11 February 1993, Kamal Amrohi died

 On May 23, the central government said that it is working on a long-term solution to relieve the rising prices of petrol and diesel
 sarkaar ne kaha tha ki ham jaldbaaji main koi faisla nahin lenge
 Significantly, during the Karnataka elections, there was no increase in the prices of petrol and diesel for 19 days, but the prices of petrol and diesel were increased as soon as the elections were over
 tab se lagaataar eendhan kii keemat main badhotaree kaa daur jari tha

 mulaayam singh yadav ne yah baat saaf kar di ki party or parivaar main mache ghamaasan ke baavjood vah akhilesh yadav ko mukhyamantri pad se hataane kii nahin soch rahe hai
 When asked about this in the Milpres conference in majority name, Mulayam Singh Yadav said that it is true that Samajwadi Party had got majority in his name, but now he cannot think of becoming chief minister for two months
 lekin mulaayam singh ne yah kahkar akhilesh yadav ke samarthakon kii chintaa badha di ki mukhyamantri koun hoga iskaa faisla jeet kar aae vidhayak karenge
 Supporters of Akhilesh Yadav want the Samajwadi Party to clearly declare him the chief ministerial candidate

 Akhilesh Yadav's supporters also clashed with the police
 akhilesh yadav lakh maang karen ki amar singh hi party main musiibat kii jad hai lekin mulaayam ne saaf kar diya ki unke man main amar singh ke liye agaadh prem he
 When asked if action was being sought against Amar Singh, Mulayam Singh's reply was that a conspiracy is going on against Amar Singh
 ramgopal par kuch bhi sunne ko taiyaar nahibhi haal kii baat he ki ramgopal yadav ko party kaa mukhya ranneetikaar or chanakya mana jaataa tha
 But on Tuesday, Mulayam Singh said that Ram Gopal's words are no longer important to him
 mulaayam singh kii press conference main shivpal yadav ke alaava vah teenon mantri bhi maujuud the jinhen haal main hi akhilesh yadav ne apane mantrimandal se barkhaast kar diya
 The ministers sitting next to him had a clear indication that Mulayam Singh wanted his return to government
 lekin is bare main puche jane par mulaayam singh ne kaha yah faisla unhone mukhyamantri par chhod diya he
 The controversy raised in the Samajwadi Party is not taking the name of freezing
 somvaar ko puure din party or yadav parivaar kaa hai-voltage drama jari rahaa
 Efforts at reconciliation continued after the uproar during the meeting in Lucknow, but the path of reconciliation could not be found
 mangalvaar ko mulaayam singh ne press conference kii, jisamen akhilesh yadav shaamil nahin hue
 However, Shivpal accompanied Mulayam in this press conference
 haalanki, iske baad bhi hangaamaa thamata nahin dikh rahaa
 The supporters of Akhilesh are shouting slogans outside the party headquarters

 Amar Singh will not be expelled from the party
 mantriyon kii vaapasi kaa faisla siem par chodta hum
 On the question of party leader in 2017, Mulayam Singh said that it will be decided after a majority
 vidhayak hi apana netaa chunenge
 On Ramgopal, Mulayam said that his talk has no importance
 cabinet main shivpal kii vaapasi par kaha kii is par faisla akhilesh lenge
 Mulayam Singh made it clear that he is not keen on becoming the Chief Minister
 mangalvaar subah media se baatcheet main shivpal ne kaha ki party main sabakuch thik he
 Whatever Netaji says will be followed
 sarkaar main vapasike sawaal par shivpal ne kaha ki jo bhi netaji kahenge main uskaa paalan karuunga
 'father jealous of son's popularity' Meanwhile, Ram Gopal Yadav has once again attacked his brother Mulayam Singh Yadav
 unhone kaha, 'mulaayam singh yadav ko akhilesh kii lokapriyata se jalan ho rahi he
 Every father wants his son to move forward but this is not happening here
 ' isse pehle somvaar der shaam akhilesh yadav ne akele jaakar mulaayam singh se unke ghar par mulaakaat kii
 While Shivpal Yadav waited for about 1 hour at CM Akhilesh's residence and then returned
 mulaayam singh ne kaha ki 2012 main bahumat mere naam par mila
 The Chief Minister made his statement first in the meeting held on akhilesh-somwar
 mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ne kaha, 'mere pita mere liye guru hai
 Netaji taught me to fight injustice
 main alag party kyon banaaungaa
 Many are causing misunderstandings
 ' akhilesh bolte-bolte ro pade
 He said that i became the Chief Minister with the blessings of Netaji
 baithak ke baad mulaayam singh ne spasht kar diya ki akhilesh ko party se nahin nikaala jayega
 During the meeting with uncle and nephew, Mulayam Singh told Akhilesh that Shivpal is your uncle, give him a hug
 baad main donon ne ek-duusare ko gale lagaaya
 After the hug, there was a scuffle between Shivpal and Akhilesh
 chashmadid ke anusaar, shivpal ne akhilesh se mike chin liya
 Shivpal asked Akhilesh why do you lie? There was a heated debate between the two
 surakshakarmiyon ne donon ko alag kiya
 On a gesture, the youth will stand up
 In the meeting, Mulayam Singh said that i am sad about the conditions of the party
 jo abhi uchhal rahe hai, ek lathi maar di jaae to pataa nahin chalegaa
 Those who are shouting slogans for Akhilesh, do not know what fight we fought
 narebaaji karne waalon ko nikaal denge
 Shivpal Singh is the leader of the masses
 main shivpal ke kaam ko nahin bhuulaa saktaa
 i am not weak yet
 mulaayam ne kaha k jo aalochana nahin sun saktaa, wo netaa nahin ban saktaa
 At our behest, the youth will stand up
 aisa naa sochen ki yuva hamaare saath nahin he
 At a gesture, youth will do anything
 amar singh kaa bachaav karte hue mulaayam singh ne kaha ki amar singh meraa bhai he
 Amar Singh helped us many times
 amar singh nahin hote to mujhe 7 saal kii jail ho jaati
 Cannot hear against Shivpal and Amar Singh
 main or shivpal kabhi alag nahin ho sakate
 Alleging Shivpal's serious allegations against Akhilesh, while accusing Akhilesh in his meeting, Shivpal said that Akhilesh wanted to form a separate party
 ye baat main apane bete kii kasam khaakar kahata hum
 i am ready to take Ganga water in hand
 akhilesh ne duusari party ke saath milakar chunaav ladane ko kaha
 Ram Gopal Yadav's brokerage will not work in the party
 amar singh kaa paksh lete hue shivpal ne kaha ki 2003 main amar singh kii madad se sarkaar bani thi
 There will be people in SP who are honest
 mukhtaar ansaari kaa naam lekar mujhe badnaam kiya gaya
 Shivpal said that the leadership of UP should be handled by Netaji

 ratan tata kii taraf se yah safai tab di gai jab media main unke istife kaa kayaas lagaaya ja rahaa tha
 Ratan Tata said that the speculation that is being made in the media by referring to the talks with the trustees is completely wrong
 ratan tatane bataaya ki trust main mahaj us vyavastha ko banane par charchaa chal rahi he jisase bhavishya main tata trust main netritv parivartan ko aasaani se anjaam diya ja sake
 Ratan Tata also pointed out that at present, the company has taken many decisions that are of national importance, so it will take command of the Tata Trusts to take these decisions to a decisive position
 unhone kaha ki trust main maujuuda kavayad mahaj isliye kii ja rahi he ki bhavishya main unke uttaradhikari ko baitaane main kisi dikkat kaa saamana na karnaa pade
 Significantly, Tata Trust has a 66 percent stake in Tata Sons
 yah pehali baar he ki kisi samay partata sans or tata trustki kaman ek aadmi ke haath main he
 Ratan Tata took over as the interim chairman of Tata Sons after Cyrus Mistry was removed
 philhal vah farvari tak tata sans ke liye nae chairman kii chalaash kar rahe hai
 Tata Sons had moved a motion to remove Wadia, an independent director in the Tata group firms including Tata Motors, Tata Steel and Tata Chemicals, to remove him from the board of directors on which the respective shareholders of the companies are to vote
 isse pehle bhi wadiya ne tata sans board ko manahani notice dekar kaha tha ki vah unke khilaaf lagaae gaye 'jhuthe apmaanasoochak or apmanjanak' aarope waapas len
 Chhattisgarh is called the power hub of the country
 lekin garmi kii shuruyaat hote hi rajya bijli kii sankat se jujh rahaa he
 On one hand, the temperature is steadily increasing, daytime temperatures have climbed to 43 degrees in most parts of the state
 duusari ore rajya kii ek ke baad ek badi bijli utpaadan vaali unit thapp ho rahi he
 Chhattisgarh is the only state in the country that has hundreds of small and large power houses
 rajya kii bijepi sarkaar ne nae bijli ghar banane ke liye aadyogic gharaanon se darjanon MOU sin kar rakhe hai
 Chhattisgarh is also identified as a state with zero power cut in the country
 lekin ab ye tamgaa usase chhin saktaa he, kyonki rajya kaa koi bhi hissaa aisa nahin he jo power cat ke daur se naa guzar rahaa ho
 Things get worse in summer
 shaharon se lekar gaavon kasbon tak log in dinon bijli sankat ke daur se guzar rahe hai
 Due to lack of technical experts and mismanagement in government controlled power houses, one plant after another is being shut down
 ek samay tha jab ye rajya padosi rajyon ko bijli saplaay karata tha
 But now itself is facing power crisis
 haal ye he ki korba ke bijli sanyantron kii aadha darjan icaayiyon main 1600 megawatt kaa utpaadan band ho gaya he
 Some of the units which are being produced are also half-incomplete
 3400 megawatt kii kshamta vaale sanyantron main abhi mahaj1300 megawatt utpaadan ho rahaa he
 The most affected Madwa's new plant has both units of 500 MW
 pehali ikai ko jahaan vaarshik rakrakhaav ke naam par band kiya gaya he
 The other unit has been shut down due to boiler lighting
 is ikai ko jald hi thik karne kaa daawa kiya ja rahaa he
 But due to many technical flaws, power generation is being stalled again and again
 korba east main 50 megawatt kii do or 120 megawatt kii ek ikai band he
 The cleaning is going on due to water entering the 120 MW unit
 dekharekh ke abhaav or laaparvaahee ke chalate is sanyatra main pani chalaa gaya tha
 a 250 MW unit with two 50 MW units has also been closed for annual maintenance
 bijli kii kami hone ke kaaran sabase zyada udyog dhandhe prabhavit ho rahe hai
 Hours of electricity is being cut in rural areas
 rajdhani raipur ke odyogic ilaakon main shaam 6 baje se raat 2 baje tak katautee kii ja rahi he
 Daily 500 to 600 MW power cuts have stalled production in factories

 After Rahul Gandhi's resignation from the post of National President of Congress, it has been decided that the party will now go ahead with the new leadership
 16 disambar 2017 ko congress adhyaksh kaa pad sanbhaalane vaale rahul ne 2 varsh se bhi kam samay main hi is jimmedaari se istipha de diya
 It will not be easy for the Congress to choose a new president in place of Rahul
 congress ko 20 varsh se adhik samay se gandhi parivaar kii aadat lagi he
 Whether the decisions related to the party or the 10-year UPA government in between, there has been a belief that the Gandhi family's consent has been necessary in every decision
 party ne gandhi parivaar se itar kabhi sochaa bhi nahin
 After Sonia Gandhi, the party's command was handed over to Rahul Gandhi
 rahul se party netaaon ko lambey samay tak netritv kii aas thi
 But after Rahul's defeat in the Lok Sabha elections, Rahul Gandhi opted out of the leadership, also put an end to the prospects of the next president from the Gandhi family
 aise main congress ke liye rahul kii jagah nayaa adhyaksh chunane kii raah mushkil hogi
 There is no preparation for the president in the Congress which has become accustomed to the Gandhi family
 isaki vajah yah bhi he ki party ne haal ke varshon main parivaar se itar kabhi sochaa bhi nahin
 The party lacks second-line leadership
 jo he bhi, vah rajyasabha main hai or unki chhavi diplomet kii he
 The Congress lacks mass base leaders
 kuch aise netaa hai bhi to vah kshetra vishesh tak simit hai
 He remained a regional satrap under the supremacy of the Gandhi family

 Lack of a national level face The Congress lacks a leader who is acceptable at the national level
 iske peeche bhi raajnneeti ke jaankaar party par gandhi parivaar kii pakad ko pramukh vajah bataate hai
 Political analyst Amitabh Tiwari says the Gandhi family did not allow any leader to grow
 vah kehete hai ki seetaram kesari se pehle party ke adhyaksh rahe pivi narsimharav ke baad koi aisa gaiyr gandhi netaa nahin hua, jiskaa rashtriya str par janaadhar or sweekaaryata ho
 Factionalism too big challenge Factionalism will also be a big challenge in choosing the new president for Congress
 party main gutbaji kii taraf rahul ne bhi ishaara kiya, lekin amitabh tiwari iske liye bhi gandhi parivaar ko hi pramukh vajah bataate hai
 He says that PV Narasimha Rao's tenure as Congress President was completed without any interference
 iske baad seetaram kesari ko hataa party kii kaman sonia gandhi ko saunp di gai
 On the other hand, there has also been a perception that the party's dependence on the Gandhi family should remain, only because the party leaders were entangled

 According to the Congress constitution, the party can be commanded by the senior general secretary, but Ashok Gehlot, the senior-most general secretary in Rahul's executive, has already refused to assume responsibility
 rahul gandhi ne aise samay par party kaa netritv choda he, jab party desh kii aazaadee ke baad apane sabase mushkil daur se guzar rahi he
 No leader of Rahul's stature is visible in Congress at this time, who can give leadership to the party in the country
 aise main rahul kii jagah nae adhyaksh ke manonayan se party ko vishesh laabh hota nahin dikh rahaa

 Three lives were lost for just one bed in a hospital in Delhi

 Unhappy with the only son's death, the parents themselves embraced death

 Avinash's condition was deteriorating continuously
 maa-baap usee haal main avinaash ko lekar ek duusare bade nami aspataal main pahunchate lekin vahaan bhi bed nahin mila
 The time Avinash should have been in the hospital, he was alternately looking from one hospital to another in the parents' lap
 saare aspataal us maasoom se munh pher rahe the
 Laxmikant and Babita reach Batra Hospital
 ye aspataal shaayad abhi biimaar nahin padaa tha
 That's why the doctor here checked Avinash and gave the medicine
 lekin jindagi ke us ek adad bed tak aate-aate shaayad bahut der ho chuki thi
 Avinash's parents announced the death in front of the doctors at the hospital after hearing the news of Tobete's death
