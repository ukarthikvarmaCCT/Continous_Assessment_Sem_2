 He described such people as 'institutional blockers' and said that exemplary action should be taken against those who are spreading lies against the Chief Justice of the country (CJI)
 sijeai ranjan gogoi ke khilaaf yon utpeedan ke aarope ke ek din baad jetali ne apane blog main kaha, 'yah samay nyaaypalika ke saath khadey hone kaa he
 The court held a special hearing on Saturday after allegations were made by a former Supreme Court employee
 arun jetali ne kaha ki vyaktigat shaleenta, mulyon, naitikta or eemaandaaree ke sandarbh main, bharat ke maujuuda mukhya nyaayadhish kaa kaaphi sammaan he

 Jaitley said that when four digital media organizations with a unique track record of 'institutional blockage' send such questionnaires to the Chief Justice, it is evident that what they are seeing is not something else? He regretted that the last few years have seen the consolidation of institutional blockers prominently
 sansthagat avarodhakon ke liye koi red line nahin hai
 He said, many of these blockers represent left or extreme left ideas
 unke paas koi chunavi aadhaar yaa lokapriy samarthan nahin he
 Nevertheless, he still has a considerable presence in media and education
 jab mukhyadhara kii media se baahar ho gaye to unhone digital or soshal media kii sharan lee he
 Jaitley said that even though most of them are associated with the ideologies and views of the marginalized, it is a matter of regret that a section of members of the Congress party have a tendency to join them
 bebuniyaad aadhaar par nyaayadhishon or yahaan tak ki mukhya nyaayadhish ke khilaaf mahabhiyog prastaavon par kuch saansadon ke hastakshar ke liye lagaataar prayaas kiye jate hai

 We have to wait till October 19 for the original picture
 swatantraaa senaanee vir saavarkar bharat kii aisi mahaan vibhuti hai, jinase kai vivaad jude hue hai
 There are some myths in these controversies and some facts
 bijepi jahaan saavarkar ko swatantraaa senaanee, param rashtrabhakt or mahaan samaaj sudhaarak kaa darja detii he to vahiin congress iske ulat unhen deshadrohi sabit karne ke liye tamaam tark detii rahi he
 On the other hand, the BJP, who considers cow as a matter of faith, considers it as a divine form, for the same cow, Savarkar never said that it should not be worshiped
 aaj saavarkar kii jayanti ke maukey par bhi ek aisa vivaad he jo itihaas main to darj he, lekin sabhi isaki vyakhya apane-apane hisaab se kar rahe hai
 Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel called Savarkar the first leader to give two nation principles
 baghel ne kaha ki hindu mahasabha ke netaa vinayak damodar saavarkar ne dharm aadhaarit hindu or muslim raashtra kii kalpana kii thi
 Savarkar did the seeds and Jinnah did the work to complete it
 aaj saavarkar kaa virodh karne vaali congress kabhi unki mureed hua karti thi
 Its hallmark is that when Indira Gandhi was Prime Minister in 1970, she issued a stamp in the name of Veer Savarkar, calling him a sacrificer and patriot for the country
 saavarkar ne kaha tha- gaay kii dekhbhaal karen, puja nahinsaavarkar ne marathi bhashaa main swatantryavir saavarkar main gaay ko lekar apane vichaar vyakt kiye the
 Chapter 1 of Part 1 and Part 2 of the book 'vigyanistha Essay' by National Memorial Publication, Mumbai
 5 main gaay ko lekar saavarkar ke vichaar likhe hai
 The title of this chapter is 'gopalan Hawe, Gopujan Navhe', which means taking care of cow but not worship
 gaay sirf ek upyogi jaanvarasaavarkar ne kaha tha ki ishwar sarvopari he
 Then there is the place of man and then there are animals
 gaay ke bare main likhaa gaya he ki gaay ek aisa pashu he jiske paas murkh se murkh manushya ke baraabar bhi buddhi nahin hoti
 Calling the cow divine is a disgrace to consider it above man
 haalanki saavarkar ne gaay ke prati khud ko samarpit bhi kaha, lekin iske peeche unhone gaay ke upyogi hone kaa tark diya
 He said that if the cow is to make the best use, it will have to be taken good care of
 indira ne kaha tha deshbhakt, jari kiya tha dak tiktaaj congress party saavarkar kaa virodh kar rahi he, lekin itihaas main dekhen to yahi congress ek samay unhen na sirf mahaan krantikari kah chuki he balki unke naam par dak tikat bhi jari kar chuki he
 In 1966, Indira Gandhi saluted Savarkar's sacrifice, patriotism and courage
 1970 main indira sarkaar ne saavarkar ke sammaan main dak tikat jari kiya tha
 Not only this, Indira is also said to have given a support amount of 11 thousand for the Veer Savarkar memorial in Mumbai
 tab saavarkar kaa gungan karne vaali congress aaj unka apmaan kar rahi he
 We bow to Veer Savarkar on his Jayanti
 Veer Savarkar epitomises courage, patriotism and unflinching commitment to a strong India
 He inspired many people to devote themselves towards nation building

 In the book, Savarkar described the 1857 rebellion as the first battle for independence against the British government

 Kejriwal may have relinquished the chair of the Chief Minister of Delhi, but his Congress and BJP rhetoric continues over Mukesh Ambani's alleged gas scam
 kejariwal ne ravivaar ko bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar narendra modi se kaha ki gas kii keemat par vah apni chuppi toden
 Kejriwal wrote on microblogging website Twitter, Modi should break his silence on the issue of gas price
 unhen yah bhi khulaasa karnaa chahie ki mukesh ambani or adani ke saath unka or unki party kaa kya rishta he
 Kejriwal ordered an FIR against Petroleum and Natural Gas Minister Veerappa Moily and Reliance Industries and its chief Mukesh Ambani for alleged black marketing of natural gas in the country
 kejariwal ne twitor par likhaa, kya 2014 kaa aam chunaav aam aadmi party or mukesh ambani tathaa mukesh ambani ke do agenton rahul (gandhi) or (narendra) modi ke bich ladaa jayega? Kejriwal says that the situation started to change after the FIR was lodged against Mukesh Ambani and the Congress began to fear that such an FIR could be lodged by the AAP government even further

 Web Series: Mirzapur Artist: Pankaj Tripathi, Ali Fazal, Divyendu Sharma, Vikrant Massey, Kulbhushan Kharbanda, Rajesh Tailang, Shriya Pilgaonkar, Rasika Duggal, Sheeba Chaddha, Shubhrajyoti Bharat and others
 nirdeshak : karan anshuman, gurmeet singh or mihir desaiamejan prime kii web siries "mirzapur" is vakt charchaa main he
 This series tells the story of the city of Uttar Pradesh, which has not yet become a city of law
 aisa shahar jo dekhne main kasbaa zyada najar aata he
 In reality, Mirzapur is very similar even today
 aapas main chhaton ke milane, tang galiyaan, bheed or court kachhari iske shahar hone kaa bhram he
 This city is like a "jungle"
 vaisaa hi jaise avadh or purvanchal ke tamaam shahar apni sachai main hai
 Review 2: How is Pankaj Tripathi and Ali Fazal's Mirzapur in terms of acting? a city where bulls and dogs have access to the district office, where people "need not be an accident" on the streets is more important than this Take care of the matter that no one comes and hits me
 ek aisa shahar jisaki samvednaaen pataa nahin kis baat main guttham guttha hai, jo naaraaz hone par maa bahan kii gaaliyaan to baktaa hi he, bahut khush hone par bhi aisa hi karegaa, ye tay he
 And there is also a city where there is no race left behind
 is shahar kii res duusare tarah kii he or yahaan takat sabase jaruri shart he
 But it is not exactly the same as seen in Mirzapur
 jangal main hota kya he? jo jitna taqatvar, kad, or pahunch utana hi majboot or kaaleen bhaiya kii tarah aasmaan sareekha ooncha
 Mirzapur is also a city where most dreams look similar to other cities
 lekin bablu pandit (vikrant maisi) jaise kai sapane jaruraton kii bhent chadh jate hai or guddu pandit (ali fazal) jaise sapane 'mirzapur kaa king' jaisaa bhaukaal paanaa chaahate hai
 There are also some concerns, which are usually related to cities
 aparaadh kii aanch main sulagate or barbaad hote shahar ko bachaane kii jaddojahad
 This dream is of Advocate Ramakant Pandit (rajesh Telang)
 lekin unka ye sapana bhi "licency gan" ke protection kaa mohataaj he
 This is the irony of our times
 ramakant pandit, qamar main gan khoskar adaalat practice karne aate hai
 Guddu and Bablu Pandit are his sons
 ek beti bhi he dimpi
 Review 3: Ali Fazal, Pankaj Tripathi's web series Mirzapur, where did you miss? Guddu is weak with intelligence
 do saal lagaataar fail hua he
 He is very fond of body building and dreams of becoming Mr
 Purvanchal
 bablu duniyaadaari or padhane likhane main bahut hoshiyaar
 But the financial condition of the house prevents him from going to Lucknow for good studies
 donon bhai or bahan ek hi college main padhai kar rahe hai
 Dimpy's friend Sweety (shriya Pilgaonkar) wants Guddu
 vah is intazaar main he ki kab guddu use date par le jaataa he
 Munna Tripathi (divyendu Sharma) is also contesting the post of president in this college
 munna, sweety ke ekatarfa pyaar main he
 Sweety's sister is also Golu in college
 guddu, college or shahar main munna ke rubaab se bahut prabhavit he
 Mirzapur city is ruled by only the carpet brother
 kaaleen bhaiya yani akhandanand treepathi (pankaj treepathi) jo hai to karpet ke vyavsaayee, par wo mirzapur se purvanchal ke aparaadh jagat ko control karte hai
 Kaalin Bhaiya is middle aged and is Bahubali in place of his "bauji" (kulbhushan Kharbanda)
 bouji wheel chair par hai
 Channels like Discovery remain on TV throughout the day
 haa, kabhi kabhaar jarurat padane par bete or pote ko guide bhi karte hai
 The closest of Kaalin Bhaiya is Maqbool (saaji Chaudhary) who is extremely loyal
 lekin, kaaleen bhaiya apane bete munna treepathi kii harkaton se pareshaan he
 He is also always afraid of Ratishankar Shukla (shubhrajyoti Bharat) of Jaunpur
 rati kii nigaah baraabar mirzapur ko kaabo main lene kii he
 He is also worried about how Munna will handle the empire and business of fear in the city that he and his father have created? Another concern of the carpet brother is that of his second wife Bina Tripathi (rasika Duggal)
 vah is baat kaa khyaal rakhte hai ki bistar par ek pati kii jimmedaari acchhee tarah se nibhaalein
 However this does not happen and Bina Tripathi is "unimpressed" by her husband
 binaa chhipakar ghar ke naukar raja se ham bistar hoti he
 There are also police officers like Gupta who take salaries from the government and work to give government protection for the carpet brother
 gupta ji, sweety or golu ke papa hai
 At the center of the story of Mirzapur is the war over the occupation of the city
 bouji yani kulbhushan kharbanda, akhanda, rati or makabool kii madad se thakur mafiaon ko markar kabhi is shahar par kabja karte hai or uttaradhikaar de dete hai apane bete akhanda or pote munna ko
 Makes Rati loyal
 ye baat rati ko pasand nahin ai
 Accidents happen
 kabhi khud ko treepathi family kaa hissaa samajhane vaale rati ko mirzapur chhodkar janaa padataa he
 Guddu and Bablu go through the crime of saving their sister, father, and mother at the hands of Munna Tripathi
 munna kii bhayanak pitayee ke baad unke paas do hi vikalp hai
 One would either lose his life in hostility to Kaalin Bhaiya or work for Kaalin Bhaiya and get the murder case against Munna Tripathi cleared
 donon bhai kaaleen bhaiya ke ofer ko maan lete hai
 After this, for the carpet brother in the city, the pair of the two brothers commit one act in crime
 guddu or bablu ko kaaleen bhaiya kaa saath pasand nahin
 He is bruised from both inside
 beton ke apradhi banane ke baad ramakant unhen ghar se nikaal detaa he
 With the power of Guddu, Bablu brings the business of carpet brothers of his brother into a profitable profit
 vah kaaleen bhaiya ke liye hatyaein karata he
 Happy with the increase in business, the brother-in-law also involves both brothers in the opium business
 kaaleen kii aad main uskaa kaarobaar fal phool rahaa he
 Even if Guddu and Bablu have to leave the house
 lekin unki maa vasudha pandit shahar main beton rutabe se bahut khush hai
 On the other hand, the leader ie Yadav ji demands more and more funds in exchange for political protection from the carpet brother for the fund
 holi party main munna or yadav ji bhid jate hai
 Rati Shukla, who came for the meeting, is trying to take advantage of the conflict between Tripathi family and Yadav ji
 yadav ji use chunavi fund ke badale mirzapur dene kaa sauda kar letaa he
 However, Guddu, Bablu and Munna Tripathi's feud does not stop despite the carpet brother's denial
 munna kaa dost compounder dhokhe se guddu ko drug kii aadat bhi dalava detaa he
 There are a lot of twist turns in the story
 shahar main aparaadh ke safaye kaa jimmaa miltaa he nae espi maurya ko
 Upon coming to Mirzapur, Maurya first attacks Bablu and Guddu
 donon police ko nuksaan pahunchaakar batch nikalate hai
 After knowing about the attack, Kaalin Bhaiya advises both brothers to be underground for a few days
 isi dauraan munna ke ishaare par uskaa dost compounder kaaleen bhaiya kii jaan lene kii koshish karata he
 When caught, he is killed by Munna
 kaaleen bhaiya or guddu bablu pandit ke bich galatchhemiyaan dekhne ko milti hai
 How do both brothers escape from the police, what happens to Yadav Ji, how Rati is killed
 munna treepathi, guddu bablu se kaise badla letaa he
 What happens next after Rati dies, what happens to SP Maurya? You will have to watch the series for all these things

At the same time, Delhi Police has refused to participate in the magisterial inquiry initiated by the Kejriwal government, saying that it is a matter outside the jurisdiction of Delhi Government

 In the FIR, AAP workers have also been accused of obstructing the police work at every step and provoking that Rajasthan farmer Gajendra Singh
 police ke varjan se home ministar rajnath singh ne bhi sahmati jataai
 In Parliament, Rajnath Singh said that the policemen present on the spot had alerted the control room and asked for a fire brigade and staircase to be taken off the tree
 police ne bheed ko gajendra ko bhadakaane se rokane kii koshish bhi kii
 In such cases, such an attempt should be made to persuade those who try to persuade, to talk, but people kept shouting and clapping
 exiaar main police kaa kahana he ki 12 bajkar 50 minute par police ne control room ko sajag kar diya tha
 The police have also written that after the consignment arrived, AAP workers were asked to make way for the emergency vehicle and fire brigade but they did nothing

 On this whole matter, AAP leaders Sanjay Singh and Kumar Vishwas said in a press conference that this is all a conspiracy and the police are plotting against it at the behest of the central government

 Devotees of all religions go here to offer their prayers
 is dargah main 2012 se mahila jairinon kii ibaadat ke liye alag jagah di gayi he

 Usman Banjara, a lawyer representing the trust in the case, told reporters, "women coming to the dargah are not allowed to go close to the tomb because they do not know at what stage they are

 Referring to a person named Sanjeev Jha, he said that he is saying that in his assembly there is a colony where about 100 percent of the votes are cast, 900 votes and all of them are in the 'sweep', now if 50 If we show the percentage of votes to BJP, there is a doubt in our mind that something will go wrong

 film 'hero' se debyue karne ja rahe actor suraj pancholi in dinon apni film ko lekar khub charchaa main he
 Superstar Salman Khan is going to launch this star kid
 apni aani vaali film or personal life ke bare main suraj pancholi ne kai baaten share kii
 Here is some special excerpt of this special conversation with him: How did you get the film 'hero'? Salman Sir always had to be a 'hero'
 salmaan sar ne kaaphi pehle jab mujhe yashraj films main dekha tha to poocha kii actor bananaa he or maine kaha haa
 Then when i was assisting Kabir Sir (kabir Khan) for the film 'ek Tha Tiger'
 vahaan par meri salmaan sar se mulaakaat hui, turki main shooting chal rahi thi
 i had my birthday on 9 November and Salman Sir entered the entry in my room at 3 pm
 phir mujhe uthaakar apane kamare main le gaye
 Salman sir said, 'suraj, today is your birthday, why didn't you tell me?' Then he said 'happy', i said why? So, Salman sir said that you have done the film? i said which head? So he said in his style that "I am bringing SKF production and you are doing his first film"
 to is tarah se mujhe film mili
 Would you like to share some memories of Salman Khan and father Aditya Pancholi? My dad and Salman sir are friends
 un logon kii zyada mulaakaat nahin hoti or jyaad unki baatcheet bhi nahin ho paati he
 But both respect each other a lot
 bachapan main kya aapako filmon ke prati ruchi thi?mujhe skool ke jamaane main sylvester stalon kaaphi pasand the
 And that's why i started going to the gym at the age of 14
 main hameshaa se hi sylvester jaisaa bananaa chahta tha
 And to play the rest of the romance character i have learned from Hrithik sir, Shahrukh sir and Salmanasar
 shooting se lekar trailor launch tak kabhi aisa hua ki khud ko chipa ke rakhana he?ji haa, aisa kaha to gaya tha ki baahar nahin ja sakate, media main nahin ja sakate, lekin main kaaphi free insaan hum
 i went out, turned around
 logon ne photo bhi khinchaa
 How do you see competition in the industry? i want to create my own style in the industry, do not take too much pressure
 body sabake paas he, dance or acting bhi sab kar sakate hai lekin sabaki khud kaa style he
 Who are your closest friends in the industry? Shraddha Kapoor, Siddhanth Kapoor, Tiger Shroff, Ranging, son of Danny sir, and Jeeva, son of Ranjit sir are very close
 jiya khanke murder cese ke dauraan kin-kin dikkaton kaa saamana karnaa padaa?main us daur main kaaphi tutaa hua tha kyonki maine apni jindagi main kisi ko khoyaa tha
 i did not care to go to jail because losing someone was a bigger pain than that
 us vakt main sirf nafisa (jiya khan kaa asli naam) ke bare main sochataa rahata tha kyonki maine use khoyaa tha, wo mere kaaphi kareeb thi
 The media showed me like a villain, but i do not blame them because if something happens to the girl here, everyone says that hold the boy, it has become a trend
 
 God is watching everything, my case is not over yet, no one can save me if i am wrong
 naa hi salmaan sar or naa hi mere pita
 And if i am not wrong, nothing can harm me
 meraa dil kahata he kii main galat nahin hum
 i know that Nafisa also knew that i am not wrong
 agar logon ko lagata he kii main galat hum to unhen is baat kii tafsheesh karne kaa puraa haq he
 Whatever the decision of the court, i will accept it
 khabaren thi ki aapane kumaar mangat pathak kifilmsin kii he?nahin maine koi bhi film sain nahin kii he
 i have only met Ajay Devgan sir and Remo de Souza sir in connection with the film but nothing has been decided yet
 kabhi pita aditya pancholi kii shooting par jate the aap?kabhi nahin, kabhi bhi nahin
 In our family, we do not even talk about work
 aapke idal koun hai?rithik roshan, or salmaan sar se behatar insaan maine nahin dekha he
 Had i not been an actor? i loved sports
 marshall art, boxing kaaphi pasand he
 Then it would probably go in this line

 ) Bharatiya Janata Party MP Sakshi Maharaj, who has always been in the news for making controversial statements, has made another comment which remains in the discussion
 unnav main ek kaarykram ke dauraan sakshi maharaj ne kaha he ki 2019 kaa chunaav desh kaa chunaav he, iske baad 2024 main chunaav nahin honge
 Sakshi Maharaj, MP from Unnao, said that this time a tsunami named Modi is going on
 guuruuvaar ko unnav main hue samarpan nidhi kaarykram ke dauraan kaaryakartaaon ko sambodhit karte hue kaha,"ye jo chunaav he wo party kaa chunaav nahin hoga, sakshi maharaj kaa chunaav nahin hoga, pehali baar desh main jagriti ai he hindu jaag gaya he
 i am a monk who comes to mind and says, after this election there will be no election in 2024, only this election will be held
 ''sakshi maharaj ne apane bhaashan main kaha ki 2014 main desh main modi lahar thi, lekin is baar modi naam kii tsunami he
 In such a situation, the talk of coalition etc
 is inadequate
 unhone kaha ki koi bhi takat narendra modi ko pradhanmantri banane se nahin roak sakati he
 a new debate has erupted on social media following Sakshi Maharaj's statement
 aapako bataa den ki abhi kuch din pehle hi sakshi maharaj kii chitthee se bavaal much gaya tha
 Writing a letter to Uttar Pradesh BJP President Mahendra Nath Pandey, Sakshi Maharaj wrote that if the party cuts his ticket from Unnao, he could suffer a lot of loss
 apni chitthee main unnav saansad ne likhaa tha ki vah unnav ke alaava kisi or seat se chunaav nahin ladanaa chaahate hai or agar unka tikat unnav se kataa to party ko nattejey bhugatne pad sakate hai
 Significantly, the Bharatiya Janata Party has not yet released the list of its candidates, it is reported that the party's first list may come on Saturday
 sakshi maharaj apane aakraamak bayanon ko lekar jane jate hai, phir chaahe vah ram mandir ko lekar diya gaya bayaan ho yaa phir vipakshi partiyon par hamale kaa bayaan ho
 At times, his statements have also become a matter of concern for the party
 viraat ko apni ladi lav se aajkal puraa atension mil rahaa he
 Virat gets hurt, Anushka feels pain
 apni kandhe kii chot ke chalate viraat ipel ke 10 wein sijan kaa ek bhi match nahin khel paae hai or unki garlfriend anoushka apane lav kii kheriyat jaanane bangaleru pahunch gai hai
 Some pictures of Virat and Anushka are going viral on social media
 isamen anoushka or viraat donon ek ghar se baahar nikalate najar aa rahe hai
 virat-anushka's engagement on social media tells you that Shane Watson is currently captain of the Royal Challengers team because of a shoulder injury
 viraat ko australia ke khilaaf chaar maichon kii siries ke tisare test main fielding ke dauraan kandhe main chot lag gai thi
 After that Virat could not play in the fourth Test
 ipel main aaarasibi teen match khel chuki he, lekin viraat philhal maidan se dur hi hai
 Virat has no fracture in his shoulder, but doctors have advised him to rest
 chot bad naa jaae, isiilie viraat philhal cricket se dur hai
 Kohli shared a fun-filled video on his official Instagram account on Friday
 video main viraat ke saath royal chalangers bangalore ke chaar khilaadi bhi maujuud hai
 In the video, Virat is seen driving a vintage jeep

 malwa kii mitti kii taasir kuch alag hi he
 If it was here, it is the same as what is in the rest of the Hindi belt, but andaz-e-bayan is different
 jaraa dekhie, raat ke 10 baje hai or indore ke aitihaasik rajbada par ‘‘anna bhaiya’’ kii paan kii dukaan par bheed he
 The eating of betel is different here
 ve gilori aapako haath main nahin pakadaayenge, sidhe munh main daalenge
 From here, after catching 'ai Basya (city Bus Service of Indore) and reach the railway station, a different view will also be seen here
 marathi thali ke liye mashhoor nilkanth bhojanalay main notice laga he ‘‘agar thali main khaanaa choda to extra charge lagegaa
 "goya eatery did not happen, the mother's kitchen was scolded, which was teaching the sanskar to consider food as Brahma
" malwa ke mizaaj main anushaasan or apnaapan kuch is tarah ghulaa he ki yahaan kaa namakeen bhi mithaas liye rahata he
 That is why even when the havoc of Lok Sabha elections has reached the abyss of courtesy in the entire country, the eloquence in the tongue here is not insolent and at times it is a joy of tongue-in-cheek
 (indore ke danceri gaanv main chunaav prachaar ke dauraan sumitra mahajan)ulatbaansi kaa yah andaaj lagaataar aathvin baar indore se saansad banane kii koshish kar rahi bijepi kii varisht netaa sumitra mahajan or unhen lagaataar duusari baar chunauti de rahe congress pratyaashee satyanarayan patel kii chunavi chaoupaalon main bhi dikh rahaa he
 Sumitra Tai is seeking votes in the name of the Prime Minister's Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) here
 unka daawa he ki saansad ke naate is yojana ke safal sanchaalan main unka yogadan he
 Whereas in these general elections, bjp's prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi has a simple phrase to curse the plans of the Congress government
 vahiin, patel yahaan satta virdohi lahar ko mudda bana rahe hai jabaki desh bhar main congress ke khilaaf isi cheez ko bijepi mudda bana rahi he
 Perhaps the reason for the u turn of issues is that Indore has been a BJP stronghold for a long time
 aise main congress kii bhashaa vipaksh kii or bijepi kii bhashaa sattadhari party jaisi ho jaati he
 And now that the voting day is getting closer, we had to leave the wide roads of Indore and go to the rural Dewatla assembly constituency to find Tai in the afternoon of Chait getting hot day by day
 daamer kii pakki sadak jaise-jaise shahar se dur hoti gai, gehun ke kheton ke bich gulab kii badilon ke manjar najar aane lage
 If the concrete houses were sealed on the promises of development, then the road between the pits would explain the difference between reality and harvest
 tabhi dopaher ke teen baje rolae gaanv main graminon ko sambodhit kar baahar nikalati tai najar ain
 Tai's convoy, which has managed eight rural meetings so far, had yet to conduct five more meetings, so it was better to ride the white-colored Innova, seizing the opportunity
 gaadi main maamuli se laal kanghe se bal sanvarti tai kahati hai, ‘‘yah chunaav saadhaaran chunaav nahin, desh main badlaav kaa chunaav he
 Congress has brought many plans, but it does not have the power to execute them
 modiji desh ko yah dam dikhaaenge
 "in a short while, his convoy reached Patel's Dansari village
 yahaan ek bargad ke ped ke neeche chunavi chaoupal lagi
 Where this Marathi Brahmini appealed to the people to vote for him
 udhar, indore shahar main unke pratidwandvi sattu bhaiya nehru nagar ilaake main khuli jeep main road sho karte najar aae
 If Tai has experience and leisurelyness, then this big farmer who owns his own helicopter has enthusiasm and enthusiasm
 pichhali baar ve kareeb 6,000 vot ke antar se tai se haare the
 This time he is confident of bridging this gap
 lekin jaankaron ko dar he ki modi kii kathith lahar kahin is baar tai kii sankatmochan banakar satyanarayan kaa saansad banane kaa vrath adhuraa hi na chhod de
 Raising his biggest issue, Patel says, "tai is completely passive
" indore ab badlaav chahta he
 "but if the winds of change go everywhere like Indore, then the Congress will remain in deficit
" malwa or aasapaas ke ilaake kii jin 10 loksabhaa siton par 24 april ko vot daale jaaenge, vahaan kaante kii ladaai he
 Apart from Indore, Vidisha, Dewas, Ujjain, Mandsaur, Ratlam, Dhar, Khargone, Khandwa and Betul seats will be voted on this day
 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav main inamen se 6 siten congress or 4 siten bijepi kii jheli main gai thim
 The Congress stalwarts whose reputation is at stake here include Kantilal Bhuria from Ratlam, Meenakshi Natarajan from Mandsaur, Arun Yadav, son of late senior Congress leader Subhash Yadav from Khandwa and Sajjan Singh Verma from Dewas
 vahiin bijepi ke liye tai ke alaava saakh kaa sabase bada sankat vidisha main loksabhaa main vipaksh kii netaa sushamaa swaraj ke saamne he
 Swaraj, who won easily without any major challenge due to cancellation of the nomination of last time Congress candidate Rajkumar Patel, is being challenged this time by Laxman Singh, brother of Congress leader Digvijay Singh
 yah seat is myne main bhi dilachasp he, kyonki yahaan loksabhaa ke saath vidhansabha kaa upachunaav bhi hona he
 This seat was vacated by Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan after winning
 chunauti kitni kadi he iskaa mujaharaa bhojpur vidhansabha ke obedullagunj ilaake main swaraj kii sabhaaon main dikhaai diya
 On 12 April, at 5
30 pm, when she entered the meeting in Nanukheda village, she was stopped by the women of the village on the mud-soaked road
 khud bhi shvipaksh kii shashakt aawaaj, sushamaa swarajya kaa naaraa lagane vaali swaraj chup rahane ke sivaa kuch na kar sakin
 She did not even mention Narendra Modi's name in the entire speech when she arrived at the Swaraj stage in a black chinted green saree with nephew of BJP veteran Sunderlal Patwa and local MLA Surendra Patwa
 ve baar-baar apni uplabdhiyon or chouhan kii vikaas purush vaali chhavi ko hi ukerti raheen
 Swaraj and Shivraj also dominate the bjp's election posters in Bhojpur area
 bhojpur se uttar kii ore waapas lauten to puraa bhopal shahar or phir kark rekha paar karne ke baad daaen haath par ek pahari par sanchi kaa mahaan stupa najar aata he
 After that, under construction Mahakavi Kalidas Dwar welcomes you to Vidisha
 13 april ko aasapaas ke ilaake main lakshmana singh patni ke saath chunaav abhiyaan main jute the
 He met her at Gobardaga village, 20 km from Vidisha
 sanyog se usee samay swaraj kaa kafila bhi vahiin se gujara
 Meanwhile, Laxman Singh, wearing a Playboy merchandise cap, cheered the activists, "we have taken them off the chopper to the car
" samaj lo, aadhi ladaai to ham jeet gaye
 "but he avoided the question of how many votes he would win
" sabko pataa he ki yah chunaav kathin he
 Issues are missing and emotion goes head-on
 tivi, radio, akhbaar or diwaar chunaav kaa maidan hai or jameen par khadaa aadmi khamosh he
 He is a victim of election fatigue because he has dealt with the election four months ago

 Although there is no such category in the Guinness book, when the team was doing research in Mumbai, it came to light that Kismeer has written the most songs
 tab ek nai category banaai gai or samir ko sammanit kiya gaya
 It seems our national character has become a controversy
 ham har bade-chote mudde par vivaad paidaa kar dete hai
 The condition is that no day goes by that no one has disputed any issue
 is desh main jahaan aaj bhi garibi, ashiksha or berogari he vahaan har roj ajeebogareeb vishyon par vivaad khadey kiye jate hai or kai baar unka makasad inase dhyaan hataanaa hi hota he, lekin is samay ek nihaayat hi bevajaah or utapataang vivaad khadaa hua he
 India's tennis star Sania Mirza has been appointed as the brand ambassador by the state government there
 sania hyderabad kii rahane vaali hai or unhone tennis ke khel main bharat kaa naam ooncha kiya he, lekin telugana ke bijepi saansad ke lakshmana ko yah baat pasand nahin ai or unhone sania ko pakistan kii bahu bataakar ek katu vivaad khadaa kar diya he
 They say she is the daughter-in-law of Pakistan and should not be made a brand ambassador of Telangana
 netaji kaa yah bayaan na keval gairjimmedaarana he balki apmanjanak he
 How unbelievable is this comment about the player who has played for India for more than a decade and has brought laurels to the country and is considered to be India's best female tennis player? i have elevated unhen un mahaan bhartiya mahilaon main se ek kaha jaataa he, jinhone desh ko gauranvit kiya
 She is from Hyderabad and her ancestors also belonged there
 unki or unke pita ke parivaar waalon kii deshbhakti main koi fark nahin aayaa he
 Sania, of course, married Pakistani player Shoaib Malik, but she neither accepted staying there nor has she ever expressed her intention to play on his behalf
 ek pakistani se shaadi karke bhi vah apana zyaadaatar samay bharat main bitaati hai, is desh kii ore se hi khelti hai or in sabase badi baat he ki is desh kaa hi gungan karti hai
 Never has he said anything in support of Pakistan and opposed India
 phir yah ashobhaneey tippanee kyon?jaahir he sasti lokapriyata kii talash main bijepi saansad ne yah halkaa or nihaayat hi gairjimmedaarana bayaan de diya he, jis khilaadi ne itane khitaab jite hon or videshon main bharat kaa jhanda ooncha kiya use mahaj isliye paraayaa bataa dena ki usne ek pakistani se shaadi kii he, anuchit he
 Sania Mirza is the pride of India
 ab yahi ummid kii jaani chahie ki saansad mahoday apane is bayaan ko waapas lenge

 As a question, he was asked, 'how many lovers do you have? How many have been caught in your trap so far? ' Pooja and Aarti say that during the question and answer, both were brought under great stress
 gauratlab he ki november maheene main donon bahanon ke saath chalati bas main chhedchhad hui thi, jiske baad donon bahanon ne bas main hi teenon aaropee kuldeep, mohit or deepak kii pitayee kar di thi
 After the video of the incident surfaced, both were announced to be given prizes, but later the matter became complicated after the two sisters came out with similar videos one after the other and the government formed the SIT

 Questions are being raised in Congress about Rahul Gandhi's strategy? No, this is wrong news
 rahul gandhi hamaari party ke upaadhyaksh hai
 Are leading our electoral strategy
 isamen koi andeh nahin he ki wo sahi kaam nahin kar rahe hai
 They want change
 wo chaahate hai ki yuva netaa aage aaen
 They want to change the process of selection of candidates so that people associated with land can get tickets
 kabhi to shuruyaat hogi is prakriya kii
 He has done these experiments at NSUI
 use congress main laane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 It is true that Rahul Gandhi is also thinking of the future, but he also knows that our first fight is of 2014
 use nazarandaaj nahin kar rahe
 Therefore visiting the whole country
 rahul gandhi main aatmavishvaas kii kami he?rahul gandhi ji bolte kam hai
 Their way of working is different
 wo daawa nahin karte
 That me
 
 
 main
 
 
 Me
 
 
 nahin karte
 They want to be a good team
 wo chaahate hai ki humlog sab ek hokar chunaav lade
 Do not depend on just one person
 aisa chunaav prachaar karen ki logon ko puri congress party par vishwaas ho
 On one hand Modiji is saying vote me while Rahul Gandhi is asking for vote for the entire Congress party
 taaki aapke saamne ek team khadi ho
 What about body language
 sabko log narendra modi ke mafik chaude to nahin he
 We will work decently
 ham satta main rahe hai
 Our government has run for 10 years
 hamen pataa he ki chunaav main hamen kya karnaa he or kya nahin
 There is a way of speaking
 gaali kii raajnneeti nahin honi chahie
 
 
 
 to jehar kii kheti or khun kii raajnneeti kaa bayaan kya he?unhone jehar to failaayaa he
 This is the politics of BJP and RSS
 khaas taur se bihar or uttar pradesh main dhruvikaran kii raajnneeti ho hi rahi he
 Modi has not received any clean chit in the 2002 riots
 ye galat prachaar he
 The Supreme Court has said that there is no evidence to prosecute Modi
 par ye bhi kaha he ki galat kaam hua, aapraadhik maansikta se faisle liye gaye
 But the evidence is not enough
 par bijepi to vikaas ke agenda par chunaav lard rahi he?ham to chaahate hai ki bijepi kaa asli cheharaa dikhe
 Evolution and governance are masked
 asli agenda he sampradayik dhruvikaran kaa
 i have been saying for the last 6 months that there will be an election between the Congress and the RSS
 bijepi kii chaabi aresas ke paas he
 Development is a mask
 asli cheharaa janata ke saamne aana chahie
 His real face was seen in Muzaffarnagar riots
 
 
 
 So why did the people reject you in Gujarat? It is true that our party has lost elections to Modi
 teen baar wo mukhyamantri bane hai
 But what kind of politics has he done in Gujarat
 samaaj main jo vibhaajan laayaa he
 People are divided on the basis of religion
 unki saamaajik vichaardhaara kya he? ham isapar sawaal uthaa rahe hai
 Yet we talk of development
 kabhi-kabhi chunaav prachaar main aise shabdon kaa istemaal hota he
 Not only us, the opposition also makes such statements
 jahaan tak sonia gandhi 'jehar kii kheti' vaala bayaan he
 There is nothing wrong in this
 ye sach hi to he, bijepi kii raajnneeti dhruvikaran kii he
 Whose oxygen is poison
 kya modi se dar gai he congress?sach to yah he ki aaj bijepi modi ban gai he
 BJP is zero, only Modi appears
 wo kehete hai ki mujhe vot dijie
 While we are seeking votes for the Congress party
 hamaari ranneeti modi par kendrit he kyonki hamaare saamne bijepi nahin modi hai
 bjp's election symbol also seems to have changed
 camel ke phool kii jagah modi kaa phool najar aata he
 We have fought many elections
 kai jite or kai haare
 We are not going to run away from it
 modi ji kitne bhi aakraamak hon
 No matter how sharp their language
 hamaare paas badi chunautiyaan he
 Have a hard time
 har rajya main agal-alag paristhiyon kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 The truth is that we have organization throughout the country
 isamen koi do raay nahin he ki modi kaa campan aakraamak he
 They are also being promoted in media and social media
 wo kalakaar aadmi hai
 The place where you go is seen in the costumes
 media main bhi unako acha kawarej miltaa he par isse ye sabit nahin hota he ki ham dare hue
 We are also campaigning
 rahul gandhi jagah-jagah ja rahe hai
 a message is being taken to give a mandate to the Congress party
 kyonki congress kii vichaardhaara se desh aage badhkar paaegaa
 Does Rahul Gandhi copy Kejriwal's politics? Rahul Gandhi does politics of change
 parikrama kii nahin
 went public
 wo saamaajik kaaryakarta kii tarah nahin karte
 They are doing such politics even before Kejriwal's arrival
 pichley 10 saal se rahul gandhi ne ye sabakuch kiya
 Worked on women empowerment in Uttar Pradesh
 kya bhrashtachar ke kaaran congress kii chhavi kharaab hui?tikat kii ghoshnaa hone dijie
 When Rahul Gandhi says that we are against corruption then our agenda is clear
 lokapal bill lekar aae
 Congress-ruled states will also have a strong Lokayukta
 ek baar tikat kii ghoshnaa hone to dijie
 We also want to eradicate corruption from the life of the common man

 wo kerala ke trishur main rahati hai
 Priya's upcoming Malayalam film 'uru Honor Love' has the song 'manikya Malaraya Poovi'
 ye unki debyue film he
 After the song went viral, Priya has been followed by more than 6 lakh people on Instagram in a day
 iske saath hi priya prakaash ne kaili jiner or christiano ronaldo jaisi hastiyon kii barabari par pahunch gai hai
 An FIR was lodged on Priya Prakash's song, accused of hurting the sentiments of Muslims, she said in an interview that working in Bollywood is her dream, but at the moment she wants to focus solely on her college and upcoming film
 itnaa hi nahin priya ‘padmavat’ film ke diarector sanjay lila bhansaali ke saath bhi kaam karnaa chaahati hai
 Her favorite actress is Deepika Padukone
 agar mumbai ke prasiddh siddhivinayak mandir kii vaarshik 40 karod ru
 If we look at the income of the people, then we have to believe that Lord Ganesha is the god of prosperity
 lekin is mandir ke 'swami' 63 varshiya krishnakumar patil, unki 81 varshiya maa indira or 50 varshiya bahan shaila par unki kripadrushti maano nahin padi he
 He is imprisoned in a dilapidated room of 200 sqft rented house in a low-income township 500 meters away from the temple, as he has only one pair of saris
 yah parivaar mandir main se apane hisse ke liye maharashtra sarkaar or siddhivinayak mandir trust ke saath lambii kanoonee ladaai main ulajh he
 The Bombay High Court has asked the state government to sympathetically include them among the 11 trustees of the temple
 sarkaar ne isamen asamarthta jataai he or iskaa koi kaaran nahin bataaya he
 This temple was built on 19 November 1801 by Laxman Vithu Patil, ancestor of Patil
 mandir kii adhikrut website bhi is daawey kii pushti yah kehete hue karti he ki lakshmana ne yah mandir kinhin deubai patil ke nirdesh par or unki vittiya madad se banaaya tha
 Despite the family dispute in 1928, the Patil family continued to manage the temple till 1941
 uske baad se yah parivaar mandir ke prabandhan ko apane niyantran main laane ke liye lagaataar sangharsh kar rahaa he
 Krishnakumar has no permanent source of income
 kuch varsh pehle tak ve ek gairaaj main gaadiyaan dhone kaa kaam karte the
 He says, "I am a diabetic now, can't work hard
" ham jinda hai, to sirf bhakton dwaara di ja rahi madad ke boote
 On 4 March 2005, the High Court asked the Maharashtra government to consider appointing Krishnakumar as the trustee of the temple on the basis of sympathy
 agast, 2007 main krishnakumar ne vidhi va nyaay vibhaag ko yachika di ki vah unhen trustee niyukt kare lekin trust ne unka aavedan khaarij kar diya
 Krishnakumar then reached the High Court, which ruled on 21 January 2009 that, "the learned counsel appearing for the state has said that the government will consider the petition of the applicants for the two vacant posts of trustees as on date
" unhone yah bhi kaha he ki yah kaam aath saptaah ke bheetar kar liya jayega
 In view of this statement, nothing survives in the petition, and is therefore dismissed
 '' lekin is varsh 1 sitambar ko sarkaar ne krishnakumar ko suchit kiya ki trustee ke pad par niyukti ke aavedan ko khaarij kar diya gaya he
 According to a source inside the temple, Krishnakumar claims some control of the temple management is strong enough to get him in control, but he is unlikely to be supported by the trustees of the temple due to his warmth
 is sutara kaa kahana he, ''agar ve sabhi se prem se pesh aate, to unhen unka hissaa mil gaya hota
 "but Krishnakumar justifies his warmth," he says, "taking money from the watchmen of the temple and letting them in without queuing, how can i accept it?" Says Nitin Kadam, a trustee That he has sympathy for Krishnakumar but his appointment is in the hands of the government and hence he cannot do anything
 trustiyon ne krishnakumar or unke parivaar ko yah chhot de rakhi he ki ve qatari main khadey hue bina mandir main pravesh kar sakate hai
 They visit the temple twice a day - in the morning and evening aarti
 mandir aane vaale ati vishisht vyakti or jane-maane log unhen 'mandir ke maalik' ke taur par jaanate hai
 Mother Indira also comes to the temple many times
 ek din abhinetri prity jinta ne unhen darshan ke liye ek ghante se zyada samay tak khadey dekha or vah yah dekh kar hairaan rah gayi ki ve itani der tak khadi kaise rah sakati hai
 Says Indira, "preity Zinta asked me if i get tired soon, how don't you get tired?" Krishnakumar says that he has the right to enter the temple without standing in a queue because it is "his property
" '' is
 phir bhi unke dil main ek dard he
 He says, "I have seen that the wishes of Amitabh Bachchan and many other well-known people are fulfilled after prayers to Siddhivinayak

 dilli ke purv mantri kapil mishra, apane hi mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal par aarope lagane ke baad satyagrah par baithe hai
 He makes a new charge every day and then the leader of the Arvind camp in the party responds to those allegations through the press
 philhal jo khabar aa rahi he wo punjab main aam aadmi party se judi hui he
 Aam Aadmi Party leader and MP from District Fatehgarh Sahib in Punjab, Harjinder Singh Khalsa, has threatened his life
 unhone kaha ki unhen apni hi party ke kuch kaaryakartaaon se jaan kaa khatra he
 AAP leaders have demanded from the Punjab government that their security be strengthened
 apane hi kuch netaaon kii vajah se mushkil halaat kaa saamana kar rahi party ke saansad ne yah kahkar maahaul ko or garma diya he ki unki jaan ko vaise aap kaaryakartaaon se khatra he jo arvind kejariwal ko apana hero maanate hai
 He said that many intoxicated youngsters who keep raising slogans of inquilab-zindabad near his house in Kohinoor Park area on Ferozepur Road all the time and Kejriwal is a devotee are behind his life
 unhone khulaasa kiya ki yahi vajah he ki wo ab saiyr karne ke liye bhi nahin ja rahe hai
 After this statement by MP Khalsa, the party going through difficult times in Delhi, Punjab also seems to be surrounded by difficulties
 dilli bijepi ne aagaamee nigam parshad chunaav ko dekhte hue saansad or gayak manoj tiwari ko pradesh adhyaksh kii jimmedaari saunpi to aam aadmi party ne bhrasht emsidi kaa raag alaapne main deree nahin kii
 Dilip Pandey, convenor of AAP in Delhi, has advised Manoj Tiwari to concentrate in his constituency
 'aaj tak' se khaas baatcheet karte hue dilip pandeya nemanoj tiwaripar jamkar nishaanaa saadhaa
 Pandey said that Manoj Tiwari is very short lived in his parliamentary constituency, if he is an artist then he has to give time in singing
 is bich ek nai jimmedaari unhen mili he
 Best wishes to Manoj Tiwari, but he has been crowned as the contenders, as it will be a big challenge for him to fix a corruption organization like MCD
 dilachasp baat ye he ki pichley dinon aam aadmi party ne bhi kirti aaazaad kii patni punam aaazaad jo ki ek purvaanchali netaa he ko party main shaamil kiya tha
 Manoj Tiwari, because of his singing, has a strong hold in Purvanchali society of Delhi which may raise the concern of AAP leaders in the upcoming municipal elections
 haalanki aam aadmi party kaa kahana he ki wo sakaaratmak tareeke se aane vaale chunaav ko dekh rahi he

 In Indian culture, the tradition of wearing Yajnopaveet i
e
 janeu has been going on since Vedic period
 'upanayan' kii ginati solah sanskaron main hoti he
 But in today's era people want to avoid wearing janeu
 nai peedi ke man main sawaal uthta he ki aakhir ise pahanane se phayda kya hoga?janeu keval dharmik nazariye se hi nahin, balki sehat ke lihaaj se bhi behad phydemand he
 The advantages of wearing Janeu are briefly discussed here
 1
 Protection from bacteria and germs
 People who wear weed and follow the rules of it, they keep their mouth shut while defecating
 isaki aadat pad jane ke baad log badi aasaani se gande sthanon par paae jane vaale jeevanuon or keetanuon ke prakope se batch jate hai
 2
 tan nirmal, man nirmalageneu ko kaan ke upar kasakar lapetane kaa niyam he
 By doing this, pressure is also put on the veins passing near the ear, which are directly related to the intestines
 in nason par dabaav padane se kabj kii shikaayat nahin hoti he
 When the stomach is clean, both body and mind remain healthy
 3
 Increase in strength and strength
 Those veins also pass from the ear, which is related to the testicles and secretaries
 mutr tyaag ke vakt daaen kaan par janeu lapetane se ve nasen dab jaati hai, jinase veery nikalataa he
 In such a situation, unknowingly, sperm is protected
 isse insaan ke bal or tej main vruddhi hoti he
 4
 hriday rog va bladpressure se bachaavarisearch main medical science ne bhi paaya he ki janeu pahanane waalon ko hriday rog or bladpressure kii ashanka anya logon ke mukaable kam hoti he
 Janeu is also helpful in controlling blood flow in the body
 5
 Increase in memory power by keeping the threads and tightening on daily basis also increases the memory power
 kaan par dabaav padane se dimag kii ve nasen active ho jaati hai, jinka sambandh samaran shakti se hota he
 Actually, this was the basic motive behind making children's ears pierced for making mistakes
 6
 Increase in mental strength, mental strength is also gained due to the practice of meditation
 yah logon ko hameshaa bure kaamon se bachane kii yaad dilaataa rahata he
 Also, there is a belief that wearers do not have evil spirits
 isamen sachai chaahe jo bhi ho, par keval man main iskaa gaharaa vishwaas hone bhar se phayda to hota hi he
 7
 aadhyatmik urja kii praptijaneu dhaaran karne se aadhyatmik urja bhi milti he
 It is believed that in the Yajnopaveet, the Lord resides
 yah hamen kartavya kii bhi yaad dilaataa he
 Sunny Leone is ready with another banging item song
 film he 'het story-2' or gaanaa he 'pink lips'
 The song is composed by Meet Brothers
 gane main sani hameshaa kii tarah bold dance muves karti najar aa rahi hai
 Earlier, Sunny Leone's 'baby Doll' and 'laila' item songs were also popular
 dilachasp baat yah he ki yah gaanaa aise samay main aayaa he jab het story-2 pehle se hi film kii lead actress surveen chawla kii boldnes kii vajah se surkhiyon main chai hui he
 This song of Sunny will obviously work to make the film more popular
 congress kii purv adhyaksh or upie kii cheirperson sonia gandhi apni paramparaagat raiberli loksabhaa seat par aaj namakan patr daakhil karengi
 This is Sonia's fifth Lok Sabha election in Rae Bareli, which is why the Congress has entered the electoral fray with the slogan 'five lakh cross this time'
 sonia gandhi ke khilaaf bijepi ne dinesh pratap singh ko utaara he
 While the SP-BSP has not fielded its candidates in support of the Congress
 raiberli congress kaa majboot durg mana jaataa he, yahaan se pehali baar 1952 main purv pradhanmantri indira gandhi ke pati firoz gandhi ne jeet hasil kar congress kaa khaataa kholaa tha jo sonia gandhi tak yathaavat jari he
 The Congress has been defeated here only three times, that too when no member of the 'gandhi family' had come from the constituency
 sonia gandhi ne raajnneeti main kadam rakhaa to pehali baar unhone apane pati rajeev gandhi kii sansadeey seat amethi ko apni karmbhumi banaaya
 In 1999, she was first elected as an MP from Amethi seat
 iske baad 2004 main rahul gandhi ne raajnneeti main kadam rakhaa to sonia ne bete ke liye amethi chhodkar apni saas or purv pradhanmantri indira gandhi kii sansadeey seat ko karmbhumi banaaya
 Since then, Sonia has been continuously winning elections
 modi lahar main bhi sonia gandhi ko bijepi chunauti nahin de saki thi
 As a result, Sonia garnered 5,26,434 votes and defeated bjp's Ajay Agarwal by nearly three and a half lakh votes
 raibareli loksabhaa seat par abhi tak kul 16 baar loksabhaa aam chunaav or do baar loksabhaa upachunaav hue hai
 Of these, the Congress has won 15 times, while the Bharatiya Lok Dal and twice the BJP have won from here
 1957 main pehali baar hue chunaav main purv pradhanmantri indira gandhi ke pati firoz gandhi congress ummidavaar ke taur par utre or jitkar saansad bane
 In the 1962 Lok Sabha elections, Rae Bareli seat was reserved for the Dalit class when Baijnath Kuril of Congress was elected here
 iske baad 1967 ke aam chunaav main raibareli loksabhaa seat phir se saamaanya kar di gai
 However, Rae Bareli came into the limelight when Indira Gandhi, the daughter of the first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and the first female Prime Minister of the country, entered the electoral fray from here
 1967 main indira gandhi yahaan se saansad baniin
 She won 2 consecutive times thereafter, but had to face defeat in 1977 at the hands of Bharatiya Lok Dal candidate Raj Narayan
 1980 main indira gandhi ek baar phir utrin or record maton se jeet darj kii
 After this, in 1984 and 1989, Jawaharlal Nehru's nephew Arun Kumar Nehru was elected as an MP from here
 1989 or 1991 main congress se shila kaul ne jeet darj kii
 In 1996 and 1998, Ashok Singh from BJP managed to feed lotus here
 lekin, iske baad se bijepi abhi tak jeet nahin saki he
 In 1999, Captain Satish Sharma became MP from here and in 2004 Sonia Gandhi made it his work place
 iske baad lagaataar wo jeet darj karti aa rahi hai
 In the Modi wave too, bjp's lotus has not blossomed on this seat
 dilachasp baat ye he ki sapa or basapa is seat par khaataa nahin khol saki he
 Not only this, Sana has also posted questions on her Facebook in which she is asked why she wears sindoor while being a Muslim? a comment reads that Muslim artists should respect their religion and remove sindoor after work
 yahi nahin sanaa ne apane fasebuk par un sawaalon ko bhi post kiya he jisamen unase poocha gaya he ki musalmaan hote hue vah sindur kyon pahenti hai? ek coment main likhaa gaya he ki musalmaan kalakaaron ko apane dharm kii izzat kerani chahie or kaam ke baad ghar jaakar sindur ko hataa dena chahie

 australian team world champion bani or semifinal or final main aisi do tiimon ko haraaya jinhen world cap ke dauraan koi bhi team haraa nahin saki thi
 Australia stopped Team India's victory in the semi-finals, while New Zealand chewed the nose in the final
 ek aisi plaing ilevan he jo australian team ko dharaashai kar sakati he
 The game that Australia showed during the World Cup was also entitled to become the World Champion, but now the chance is Australia vs Rest of the World
 is team main donon openar samet captain bhartiya hai jabaki srilanka, dakshin africa, newjiland or pakistan ke bhi chuninda khilaadiyon ko isamen jagah mili he
 Opener: It would be right to give Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan the responsibility of opening against the world champions Australian team
 rohit sharma bhale hi semifinal main kuch khaas nahin kar sake the lekin unka australia ke khilaaf record bahut shandaar he
 On the other hand, Shikhar Dhawan has shown in the semi-finals that he can withstand the pace attack of Mitchell Starc, Mitchell Johnson, James Faulkner and Josh Hazlewood
 middle order kii jimmedaari sanga, abi or duplaci pargafirst wicket down par kumaar sangakaara se behatar vikalp koi ho hi nahin saktaa
 During the World Cup, this batsman had single-handedly plagued the Australian attack
 sangakara jab tak krij par the tabatak australian team par haar kaa khatra bhi mandara rahaa tha
 After this AB de Villiers will come to bat
 world cap ke dauraan abi shandaar form main the or unhone virdohi team ko jamkar pareshaan kiya tha
 With AB, the middle order of the team becomes very strong
 dakshin africa ballebaaj faif duplaci bhi is team main maujuud rahenge or middle order ko or majbootee pradaan karenge
 It is very important to have a strong batting line up to face the Australian invasion
 loar middle order main iliyat or captain cooljhaloar middle order main do sabase achche finishars ko jagah di gai he
 To beat the Australian team, it is very important to have a captain like Dhoni
 dhoni wicketiper ballebaaj or captain ke rup main is plaing ilevan kaa hissaa honge
 Dhoni batted brilliantly against Australia in the semi-finals and New Zealand's Grant Elliot also batted alone in the final
 dhoni kai baar sabit kar chuke hai ki wo duniya ke best finishr hai or grant iliyat ne dakshin africa ke khilaaf semifinal main ye sabit kar diya tha
 Now in such a situation, if the top order falls apart, both of them can turn the match dice on the last chance
 loar ordernujiland ke spinner danniel vittori nichle kram main acchhee ballebaaji kar sakate hai, iske alaava pakistan ke tej gendbaaj wahaab riyaj bhi balle se kamaal dikhaa sakate hai
 New Zealand fast bowler Trent Boult and South African fast bowler Morne Morkel cannot be trusted more with the bat
 gendbaaji par najaramorn morkel, trent bolt, wahaab riyaj, danniel vittori chaar mukhya gendbaaj team main shaamil hai jabaki baaki ke 10 over ke liye grant iliyat, rohit sharma or abi divilliars hai
 Wahab riaz-wahab Riaz is a bowler who can be accommodated in all the teams that are being made against Australia
 ye riyaj hi the jinaki badaulat world cap ke quarter final main australia ke khilaaf pakistan kuch samay ke liye match main vaapasi kar sakaa
 If the catch did not drip on his ball, the result of the match would have been different
 okramakata ke liye pahchaan bana chuke riyaj tej ballebaaji bhi karte hai
 Morne Morkel - Morn Morkel 17 in the World Cup
 59 kii ausat se gendbaaji kii
 17 players including Sangakkara, mccallum, Dhoni, Raina and Brendan Taylor were sent to the pavilion
 haalanki unhone australia ke khilaaf toornament ke dauraan koi match nahin khelaa lekin wo 99 vanade kaa tajurba rakhte hai or australia ke khilaaf 15 vanade main 28
 Has taken 27 wickets at an average of 63
 australian dharti par unki gendbaaji to or bhi nikhar kar aati he
 He 25 here
 60 kii ausat se keval 17 wicket le chuke hai, wo bhi keval paanch vanade maichon main
 Trent Bolt - Now there is no need to introduce this player after Bolt bowled in the World Cup
 danniel vittori-vittori ko anubhav or australia ke khilaaf vanade main 4

 The Freedom Fighter Express from Jaynagar in Bihar to New Delhi was running late by several hours for the last several months
 jab hamane is train kii pichley do chaar dinon kaa record dekha to yah train 20 se 30 ghante kii deree se chal rahi thi
 We said that till this train does not run on time, we will keep mentioning it repeatedly in prime time
 swatantraaa senaniyon ke naam par chalane vaali train kaise der se chal sakati he wo bhi 30-30 ghante kii deree se
 Prime time seems to have had some effect
 is train kii bogi bilkul nai he
 Looks gleaming, but due to late running, it is necessary to walk
 baharhaal prime time kaa asar hua he or yah 4 may ke din yani aaj jayanagar se samay se chali he
 The train which was opening late by 20 hours has run for the first time today
 hamaare sahyogi pramod gupta kaa kahana he ki 2011-12 se yah train chal rahi he magar aaj tak samay se nahin chali, ab isaki pushti ham nahin kar sakate magar yah ho saktaa he ki deree se chalane ke kaaran train kii aisi chhavi ban gai ho
 When we discussed in detail about the Freedom Fighter Express in prime time for two consecutive days, the Railways decided that it would leave for Delhi on May 4
 iske liye aas-paas ke steshnon se bogiyaan manga kar ek nai rek yani bilkul nai railgadee banaai gai, use swatantraaa senaanee express kaa naam diya gaya
 The new rake started cleaning from the morning of May 4
 phir use darbhanga se jayanagar ke liye bheja gaya jahaan se vah bilkul rhite time dopaher 2 baje khuli he
 Our colleague Pramod Gupta was present at Darbhanga station at the time when new rakes of freedom fighter were being made by adding bogies from here and there
 yatriyon ko bhi sapane jaisaa lag rahaa tha ki vaaki ye train rhite time ja rahi he
 From Jayanagar, this train opened at right time, reached Darbhanga and then it was half an hour late
 yah train rail rajya mantri manoj sinha ke ilaake se bhi guzarati he
 Think about the condition of this train, the train coming from Delhi on 3 April did not arrive till the afternoon of 4 May
 ab jab jayanagar se yah train sahi samay par ja rahi he to hairaani kaa alam he
 After two days of prime time, this train is running on time
 hamane sochaa tha ki swatantraaa senaanee somvaar se sahi samay par chalane lagegi magar shuukravaar ko hi isamen badlaav kii koshish shuru ho gai
 We will keep a record of this for a few weeks
 kahin aisa na ho prime time ke kaaran ek baar ke liye rhite time chalaa diya or phir bhul gaye
 When it reached Hajipur station around 7
45 pm, the passengers there were also surprised that this is the same freedom fighter express which never runs at the right time
 let bhi hoti he to das ghante baarah ghante or bees ghante
 Our associate Kaushal Kishore was present at the right time when it reached Hajipur
 vahaan maujuud yatriyon ke liye aaj kaa din yaadgaar tha
 The train which ran from Delhi to Jayanagar was also running late
 lekin ek nai train banaakar swatantraaa senaanee express ko sahi samay se chalaane kaa prayaas kiya gaya he
 Now we will give a challenge to the Railway Minister and Railway Board for other trains which have been running ten to twenty hours late for the last several weeks and months
 yatri pareshaan hai, media main ye sab baaten report hoti nahin hai
 No one cares about the cost of passengers' time
 aaj hi darbhanga stesan par jo yatri amritsar jane vaali shahid express pakadaney aae to stesan par pataa chalaa ki saat aath ghante let he
 Passengers were also annoyed by the waiting room closed
 ek train he patna-kota express ye har din 15 se 20 ghante let chalati he
 The 13239 patna-kota Express running on May 4 is late by 19 hours 10 minutes
 3 may ko chalane vaali patna-kota expras 10 ghante let khuli thi
 On May 2, the patna-kota Express departed at a delay of 16 hours and 45 minutes
 bihar se badi sankhya main chaatr koching ke liye kota jate hai
 Parents and students walk from different districts and wait for hours at Patna railway station
 machharon kaa aatank bhi jhelte rahete hai
 Humsafar Express was launched on 16 December 2016
 yah train sisitivi, jeepies, mobile laptop charging point se las thi
 It was built keeping in mind the middle class travelers
 isi 13 april se champaran humsafar express kii shuruyaat hui
 Its train number is 15705
 puraani dilli se katihaar ke bich chalati he
 This is brand new train
 maheenaa bhi nahin hua he shuru hue or ye train deree se chalane lagi he
 On May 3, the Champaran Humsafar Express departed from Katihar for a delay of 14 hours 51 minutes
 dilli pahunchate-pahunchate yah train 18 ghante se bhi zyada let ho chuki he
 The passengers of the Bhagalpur Garib Chariot number 22406 are also worried
 4 may ko yah train anand vihaar se 11 ghanta 35 minute kii deree se ravaanaa hone vaali thi
 i tell you the condition of another Humsafar Express
 4 may ko bengaluru se agartala ke liye chalane vaali humsafar express ke 23 ghante deree se chalane kii soochna he
 Hopefully, Chief Minister Biplab Deb is not running in this train, otherwise he should not give any statement that what is the need to go by train, people used to get angry earlier
 behatar he ki bipbal deb rail mantri ko phone kar puuchhen ki agartala ke logon kii koi vailu he yaa nahin
 How can a train run late for 23 hours
 aap yatriyon se puuchhie unka kitna nuksaan ho rahaa he
 Since the delay of the train is not considered worth reporting in the media, but it has become such a big problem that the newspapers are full
 aisi khabaron kii kataranon se
 Many times the news has also appeared mainly but there is no effect
 ek or train he, nai dilli se barauni jane vaali vaishali express
 Delays of 4 to 8 hours have become common for this
 ye vaishali express kii general bogi kaa nazaaraa he
 Over capacity passengers are boarding
 is bheed ko dekhakar aap samaj sakate hai ki garib yatriyon ke liye general bogi kaa anubhav kuch nahin badla he
 Whatever news you hear that charger has been installed, nappy change board, all those facilities are not for these Indians
 is bheed main saans lene kii jagah nahin magar yatri apane saamaan ke saath kaise jate honge ham aage bataaenge
 Many passengers are still unable to board the train, which is why more than 250 buses have started plying between Bihar and Delhi
 in bason main suraksha or dryver kii training ke maanak kii kahin koi jaanch nahin he
 The comments yahi kaaran he ki guuruuvaar ko mujffarpur se dilli aa rahi essi bas ulat gai, aag lag gai or bas jal kar khaak ho gai
 Earlier it was reported that 12 people had died due to the fire, but now the District Magistrate has said that no one has died
 pradhanmantri or nitish kumaar ne bhi shradhanjali de di thi
 Permits for such buses should be checked
 kashish news channel ne report kiya he ki bahuton ke paas neshnal permit nahin he
 It is replaced by a tourist permit for 15 days and several buses are operating on one permit
 aam aadmi ko majaboor kiya ja rahaa he ki vah asurakshit yatra kare
 It is neither worth life nor time
 ummid he upi sarkaar, bihar sarkaar bihar or dilli ke bich chalane vaali bason kii turant jaanch karegi or sakht maanak banaaegi
 Also check which leaders these buses belong to
 ye sari basen anand vihaar se dilli ke liye khulti hai
 The problem of common people in TV is disappearing
 hawa hawaii bayanon kii hawaabazi par sara kaarobaar chal rahaa he
 Here the common man is dying by burning or dying by cutting
 ab ham ek or train kii haalat bataate hai
 Its name is 12930 Sampoorna Kranti Express
 mangalvaar ko yah train nai dilli se patna ke liye ravaanaa hone vaali thi
 Its general bogey had so many passengers that the suspension of the bogey got sunk and the bogey bowed down
 mekenekil vibhaag ne sampurna kranti ko chalaane se hi inkaar kar diya

 jab hamane do din lagaataar prime time main swatantraaa senaanee express ke bare main vistaar se charchaa kii tab railway ne faisla kiya ki 4 may ko yah samay se dilli ke liye ravaanaa hogi
 For this, a new rake i
e
 an all new train was created by asking for bogies from nearby stations, it was named as Freedom Fighter Express
 4 may kii subah se hi nai rek kii safai hone lagi
 Then she was sent from Darbhanga to Jayanagar from where she is open at exactly 2 pm
 hamaare sahyogi pramod gupta us vakt darbhanga stesan par maujuud the jab idhar udhar se bogiyaan jod kar swatantraaa senaanee kii nai rek banaai ja rahi thi
 The passengers also felt like a dream that this train was indeed going at the right time
 jayanagar se yah train rhite time khuli, darbhanga pahunchi phir vahaan tak aate aate aadhe ghante let ho gai
 The train also passes through the area of minister of State for Railways Manoj Sinha
 sochie is train kii kya haalat he, 3 april ko dilli se aane vaali train 4 may kii dopaher tak nahin pahunchi thi
 Now when this train is going at the right time from Jayanagar, there is a surprise
 do din ke prime time ke baad yah gaadi time par chal rahi he
 We thought that the freedom fighters would start operating at the right time from Monday, but on Friday, efforts to change it started
 ham kuch hafton tak iskaa record rakhenge
 Otherwise, due to prime time, the right time was run for once and then forgotten
 hazipur stesan par shaam paune saat baje ke kareeb jab yah pahunchi to vahaan bhi yatri hairaan ho uthe ki ye vahi swatantraaa senaanee express he jo kabhi rhite time chalati hi nahin he
 Even if it is late, ten hours, twelve hours and twenty hours

 Today was a memorable day for the passengers present there
 jo train dilli se jayanagar se chali he vah bhi der se chal rahi thi
 But an attempt has been made to run the Freedom Fighter Express on time by creating a new train
 ab ham rail mantri or railway board ko duusari railgadiyon kaa chalange denge jo pichley kai hafton or maheenon se das se bees ghante kii deree se chal rahi hai
 Travelers are upset, all these things are not reported in the media

 Today, at the Darbhanga station, when the passengers who came to catch the Shaheed Express going to Amritsar, it was found at the station that seven hours were late
 vatting room band hone se bhi yatri naaraaz ho gaye

 The Humsafar Express running from Bengaluru to Agartala on May 4 is reported to be delayed by 23 hours
 ummid he is train main mukhyamantri biplab deb na chal rahe hon varanaa ve kahin bayaan na de den ki train se jane kii kya zarurat he, pehle log antardhyaan ho jate the
 It is better that Bipbal Deb call the Railway Minister and ask if the people of Agartala have any value
 23 ghante koi train kaise let chal sakati he
 Ask the passengers how much damage they are causing
 chunki train kaa deree se chalanaa media main reporting ke laayak nahin samajha jaataa magar yah itani badi samasya ho gai he ki akhbaar bhare pade hue hai
 From such news clippings

 There is no check of the safety and standard of driver training in these buses

 isaki jagah 15 dinon ke liye tourist permit le lete hai or ek permit par kai basen chal rahi hai
 The common man is being forced to travel unsafe
 uski na to jaan kii keemat he or na samay kii
 It is expected that the UP government, Bihar government will immediately check the buses plying between Bihar and Delhi and make strict standards
 yah bhi jaanch karen ki ye basen kin netaaon kii hai
 All these buses open from Anand Vihar to Delhi

 After two days of prime time, this train is running on time

 We will keep a record of this for a few weeks

 When it reached Hajipur station around 7
45 pm, the passengers there were also surprised that this is the same freedom fighter express which never runs at the right time
 let bhi hoti he to das ghante baarah ghante or bees ghante
 Our associate Kaushal Kishore was present at the right time when it reached Hajipur

 The train which ran from Delhi to Jayanagar was also running late
 lekin ek nai train banaakar swatantraaa senaanee express ko sahi samay se chalaane kaa prayaas kiya gaya he
 Now we will give a challenge to the Railway Minister and Railway Board for other trains which have been running ten to twenty hours late for the last several weeks and months
 yatri pareshaan hai, media main ye sab baaten report hoti nahin hai
 No one cares about the cost of passengers' time
 aaj hi darbhanga stesan par jo yatri amritsar jane vaali shahid express pakadaney aae to stesan par pataa chalaa ki saat aath ghante let he

 How can a train run late for 23 hours

 Earlier it was reported that 12 people had died due to the fire, but now the District Magistrate has said that no one has died

 This saying fits perfectly in the politics of Bihar
 tabhi to ek-duusare ke dhur virdohi maane jane vaale nitish kumaar or lalu yadav bijepi ko maat dene ke liye kareeb aa rahe hai
 This friendship was seen only after the announcement of Lok Sabha results, when Nitish Kumar led JDU was caught in trouble
 haalanki nitish kumaar ne siyaasi daanv-pech ke jariye sarkaar to bachaa lee, kintu unhone mukhyamantri pad tyaagna zyada munasib samajha va jithan ram maanjhi ko bihar kaa nayaa mukhiya banavaa diya
 But Nitish Kumar now seems to be stuck in trouble for the Rajya Sabha elections
 is sankat kii vajah he jediu main baghawat
 Some rebel mlas of JDU have opened a front against Nitish Kumar
 is maddenjar 19 june ko hone vaale rajyasabha chunaav main baagiyon ne do siton par apane ummidavaar bhi utaar die hai
 Now Nitish Kumar is fearing that if the rebels get the support of the BJP and some mlas cross-voting by the party, the results may be troubling them
 aise main unhen lalu yadav main ummid kii kiran dikh rahi he
 Nitish Kumar told a press conference that he has spoken to Lalu Yadav on phone and sought support for his party's candidates
 bijepi par hamalaa bolte hue nitish kumaar ne kaha, 'hamen bijepi ke gemplan ko dhwast karne ke liye saath aana hoga
 What BJP is doing in today's politics is sad
 bijepi jeet par itaraa rahi he or vipaksh kaa uphaas kar rahi he
 We never scolded nor scoffed at his landslide victory in 2010
 rajyasabha chunaav main bijepi kii taraf se sajeesh ho rahi he
 Everyone knows that the entire game is being done at the behest of the BJP leader
 bijepi maanjhi sarkaar asthir karne kii koshish kar rahi he
 She wants to topple this government by any means
 'lalu se samarthan kaa zikr karte hue nitish kumaar ne kaha ki bijepi kii sajeesh ko rokna ek saajha agenda he isliye donon party kaa saath aana jaruri he
 Nitish appealed to Lalu that as the RJD supported the Manjhi government, it would continue in the Rajya Sabha elections
 ab sabhi kii nigahen argedy par he jiske paas 21 emele hai or party ne abhi tak apane pattey nahin khole hai
 According to the maths in the election, it would be difficult for the JD (U) to win seats without the support of the RJD
 haalanki lalu jithan ram maanjhi sarkaar ko saport de rahe hai lekin abhi is maamle par chuppi saadhe hue hai
 These seats are vacant due to the resignation of three Rajya Sabha members Rajiv Pratap Singh Rudy, Ram Vilas Paswan and Ramkripal Yadav
 jedy (you) ke pramukh sharad yadav bihar se rajya sabha ke liye chune ja chuke hai
 The rebel mlas of JDU did not field any candidate against Sharad Yadav but they have kept BJP MLC Dilip Jaiswal and Anil Sharma against JD (U) candidate Pawan Verma
