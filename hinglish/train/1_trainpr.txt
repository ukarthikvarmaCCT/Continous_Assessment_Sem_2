 In the case of hiding the information in the election affidavit, the Supreme Court has canceled the High Court order and ordered a trial against him

 supreme court ko yah tay karnaa tha ki 2014 ke chunavi halafname main aapraadhik keson kii jaankaree chhipaane par fadanvis ke khilaaf kanoonee karrwai kii ijaajat di jaae yaa nahin
 Fadnavis is accused of hiding information on two criminal cases in his 2014 election affidavit
 ye donon cese nagpur ke hai
 One of these is defamation and the other is fraud
 vakil satish uke ne supreme court main yachika daakhil kar aarope lagaaya tha ki 2014 ke chunaav kaa namakan daakhil karte samay main fadanvis ne jhootha halafanama daayar kiya tha
 However, earlier the Bombay High Court had dismissed the petition and said that the petition lacked facts
 uke ne hoicourt main nagpur ke jeudicial magistrate ke us faisle ko chunauti di thi jisamen aisi hi yachika ko khaarij kar diya gaya tha
 Petitioner Ukay alleged that Fadnavis had concealed information of two criminal cases pending against him in 2009 and 2014 while filing nominations from Nagpur's South West Assembly constituency
 yachikakarta ke mutabik 1996 or 1998 main fadanvis ke khilaaf vibhinn aaropon main do maamle darj kiye gaye the

 The Supreme Court of India has rejected the application seeking ban on mobile messaging apps whatsapp, Hike, Snapchat and other such apps
 court ne buudhvaar ko yachikakarta se kaha ki ham ise sunwaayee laayak nahin samajhate, agar aapako yah jaruri lagata he to aap sarkaar yaa TDSAT ke paas ja sakate hai
 Indeed, after the implementation of whatsapp and other messaging app encryption systems, it was described as a threat to the security of the country
 tark he ki iske baad kisi ke liye bhi yah sambhav nahin he ki vah do logon ke bich yaa group ke bich kii gai baat ko pakad sake
 Haryana's RTI activist Sudhir Yadav petitioned the Supreme Court to ban whatsapp
 sudhir kii is yachika main kaha gaya he ki whatsap ne april se hi ankipressant lagu kiya he, jisase is par chat karne waalon kii baaten surakshit rahati hai
 Even security agencies cannot decode these
 yachika main kaha gaya he ki agar khud whatsap bhi chaahe to vah bhi in sandeshon ko uplabdh nahin kar saktaa
 'there will be ease for terrorists and criminals' RTI activist says that encryption will make it easier for terrorists and criminals to exchange messages and threaten the security of the country
 suraksha agenciyaan in sandeshon ko monitor nahin kar paaengi
 In such a situation, whatsapp should be banned
 yachika main whatsap ke alaava or bhi duusare ap kaa zikr kiya gaya he
 Even supercomputers cannot do intercepts, it is also said that it is not possible to intercept encryption with supercomputers
 aise main aatanki gatividhiyon kii rokthaam ke liye suraksha agenciyaan na to intercept kar sakati hai na hi jaanch ko aage badha sakati hai

 sarvagun sampann kii to, sho kii storiline kaaphi mejadaar thi
 The starcast of the serial is also strong

 The concept of how a perfect daughter-in-law destroys her own family created happle in the TV audience
 magar badhate episod ke saath mekars sho kii stariline ko achche se pregent nahin kar paae
 The show started to get scattered due to lack of a tight story
 shrenu paarikh ke kairactor ko mekars khalanayika ke taur par majbootee se nahin darsha paae
 Perhaps this is the reason why the show lagged behind in TRP
 dekhnaa hoga ki serial ke ofere hone kii baat kitni sach sabit hoti he
 The body of a couple was recovered from their flat in suspicious condition from Kaka Nagar in posh area of south-east Delhi
 khaadya mantralay main sanyukt sachiv str ke adhikari kaa shav khun se sanaa bistar par padaa tha
 There are bruises on his throat
 jabaki patni kaa shav duusare kamare ke roshanadaar se chunni ke sahare lataka mila
 Indian Accounts Services Officer of 1983 batch
 vijay kumaar apni patni sita ke saath kareeb chaar saal se kaaka nagar main rahe the
 His wife was employed in a private bank
 shuukravaar shaam unki beti varanya rajasthan se ghar lauti
 When no response was received after knocking on the flat door, he informed his father's colleagues about the incident
 vijay kumaar kaa galaa dhardaar hathiyaar se kataa hua tha
 Therefore, the police have registered a case under the sections of murder
 maamle kii jaankaree police ko tab mili jab ke vijay kumaar kii 22 saal kii beti ne ghar pahunchane par vahaan se police ko phone kiya
 In the initial investigation, the police has clarified that the door of the house was locked from inside and there is no evidence of any external person entering inside
 is vajah se maamla homesaide-suicide kaa najar aa rahaa he
 The death of two senior government people in a prestigious area of delhi is seeking answers to many questions
 vijay kumaar kaa galaa kisne kaata? aatmahatya jaise halaat kyon or kaise paidaa hue? kya ye mana jaay ki pehle patni ne pati kii htya kii or phir khudakshi kar lee? yaa phir kya pehle patni ne khudakushi kii or phir ghabaraakar pati ne apana galaa kaat liya

 Finance Minister p Chidambaram's box is about to open
 chunaav main jane se pehle sarkaar is bajet ke jariye desh kaa dil jeetne kii koshish karegi to buree tarah karj main dubi janata bhi raahat ke liye takataki lagaae hue he
 But what are the challenges before Chidambaram? Challenge to get the bungalow out of the budget
 chunauti chori-chori chupake-chupake chapat naa lagane kii
 If the challenge is reduced then we are happy
 or chunauti saare jahaan se mahangaa kaa muhaavara palatney kii
 The first challenge will be to get the budget Bangalamagar, this house is strange, close to the ground, this house of brick stones, house of our haunts
 kahin khushiyon kaa khazaana he ghar, kahin sapanom kaa thikaana he ghar
 Sometimes we make happiness at home, sometimes we settle in happiness
 hamaare liye bas makaan nahin, har ahsaas kaa thikaana he ghar
 Everyone's dream is his own house, but for years, the dream of living in incomplete buildings is dying
 keemten gaganchumbi imaaraton se oonchi ho chuki hai or kahin taiyaar makaanon ko kharidaaron kaa intazaar he
 So will the 2013 budget dispel these fears? Will the home dream become a reality? Will real estate get a new life? Whether you are dreaming of buying a house or are preparing to decorate the house you will get this year
 aam bajet se aas hogi hi
 This way Fijan is an election lokapriyata kii chaashni gadhi hogi, par jab sawaal gadhi kamai kaa ho to ummiden bhi sateek hoti hai
 Tax exemption limit on home loan interest now 1
 5 lakh he
 The mother is thinking that this should be increased to Rs 3 lakh so that tax payers can see the doubled relief and dare to make the dream of the house a reality
 isse naa sirf khariddaaron ko faaydaa hoga, balki bechney waalon ko bhi
 The prices of houses have reached crores and the rules on loan in lakhs are still ten years old
 ghar main aane vaala har mehmaan agar aapaki haisiyat maapta he to drawing room ke paimaane main
 What is the paint on the walls, what is the size and brand of the TV
 sofon kii finish kisi he par ghar kii keemat kii hi tarah in sabhi chizon kii keemton main bhi aag lagi he
 Well these things are on one side, in the last two years, the construction material of houses has increased by fifty percent
 developers ko idisi-idisi ke taur par moti rakam chukaani pad rahi he, so alag or licencing or land yuz change karaane par bhi baari fees deni padati he
 This has a direct impact on the cost of the house
 acchhee khabar ye he ki is dafaa sarkaar afordable houseing ke liye kachche maal kii keemton par sabsidi dene par vichaar kar sakati he
 All these steps can directly benefit the common man
 2013 main 5 lakh logon ko milegaa gharbajet se ummid ek taraf he
 On the other hand is a new record to be made this year
 ye he grih pravesh kaa kirtiman
 In 2013, four and a half to five lakh people will get a position of their houses after a long wait
 2012 main dhai lakh logon ko gharon kaa posation mila tha
 This figure of 5 lakh homes will make 2013 the biggest year of delivery ever
 shaayad is saal aap bhi un 5 lakh logon main hon, jo apane bedroom main, apane bistar par paanv pasaar kar so sakenge
 Peace of sleep will come on this bed only if you have found your house in the promise period, otherwise you also know that there is more harm than good
 sachai to ye he ki jin logon ko is saal ghar saunpe jaaenge, unamem se zyaadaatar se vaada 7 saal pehle kiya gaya tha
 As such, the promise is that within 3 years the house will be found, but the customers just keep seeing the months turning into years
 penalty itani maamuli he ki builder ko bahut zyaada fark bhi nahin padataa or isiilie bajet satr kii sabase badi ummid he isamen pesh hone vaala real estate regulator bill
 This bill will be introduced in the budget session this time and it is also expected to be passed
 regulator ke aane se developers kii manamaani sharton par lagaam lagane vaala koi hoga
 They have to give the position of the house on time
 aisa naa karne par unpar baribharakam penalty lagaai ja sakegi
 Real estate regulator can be expected to get home on time, but to control skyrocketing prices of houses, steps will also have to be taken in the budget
 dilli yaa kisi bhi metro main ghar kaa sapana to bahut mahangaa he
 If you find a house in the vicinity, then you will get an average of 50 lakhs for a two bedroom flat area of 1000 square feet
 dikkat ye he ki paribhaasha ke mutabik 25 lakh tak kii keemat vaale ghar hi afordable houseing ke daayre main aate hai
 For which you will take a loan of up to 15 lakhs, then there will be a rebate of 1 percent in the interest rate, but where will you find such a house? kam se kam kisi metro shahar yaa uske aasapaas to bilkul bhi nahin
 Government reality is paper and in view of the increasing urban population, it needs to be realigned as soon as possible, hence there is a demand that the price range of affordable houses should be increased
 in par milane vaali tex chhot main izapha ho
 It got infrastructural status
 taaki aasaani se riyayati daron par lone mil sake
 On the one hand there is the concern of expensive house
 duusari taraf us mahange se ghar kaa ye rose mahangaa hota dining room
 Well, we will fill the house only when there is a house
 or tab bhi jab posation milane ke baad jeb main paise bhi bache hon
 This is the reason why the last date of February is waiting so strongly
 loksabhaa chunaav ke paanchave charan main rajasthan kii 12 siton par voting jari he
 Here all the hopes of the Congress rests on the state president of Rajasthan Congress and state Deputy Chief Minister Sachin Pilot
 to vahiin bhartiya janata party(bijepi) ko pradhanmantri ke naam se
 This was the area from where Sachin Pilot led the Congress to victory in the assembly elections
 pehle charan main hue 13 siton ke loksabhaa chunaav main congress fansi bhi najar aa rahi thi, lekin mana ja rahaa he ki duusare charan kii 12 siton par sachin payalat kii acchhee pakad he or yahaan se congress ko ummiden hai
 For this reason, Prime Minister Narendra Modi held four rallies for these 12 seats
 videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj grahamantri rajnath singh, sadak parivahan mantri nitin gadakari, centre sarkaar main mantri wike singh se lekar modi sarkaar ke 15 mantri in 12 siton ke liye apane takat lagaae hue hai
 The BJP also has the support of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's name in these seats
 in ilaakon main dausa, dhaulpur-karauli, bharatpur, nagaur jaisi siten hai
 Where it is believed that the Congress can win
 bikaner, jhunjhunu, sikar or jaipur gramin seat par congress or bijepi main takkar kaa muqabla mana ja rahaa he
 Neither party is fully confident of its victory
 jaipur shahar main congress or bijepi donon bhitarghaat ke samasya se ulajh rahi hai
 The party in which there has been more aggression is less likely to win
 mana ja rahaa he ki sachin payalat ke mukhyamantri nahin banaae jane se gurjar naaraaz hai, lekin sachin payalat ne is ilaake main tabadatod reliyaan kar naaraaz gurjaron ko manaaya he
 At the dholpur-karauli meeting, Sachin Pilot said that you should vote for the Congress to strengthen my hand
 sachin payalat agar apane prabhaav vaale ilaakon main jeet dilaa paaenge to party ke andar unka kad badhegaa
 On the other hand, seats like dholpur-karauli, Jaipur city, Bharatpur, former Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje have also put their strength

 is baar der se aayega monasoonakai logon ko yah monsoon kibarishlag rahi hogi, lekin mausam vibhaag kaa kahana he ki yah monsoon kii barish katai nahin he
 Although the normal date of arrival of monsoon in Kerala is June 1, but this time it is special that the monsoon has not yet knocked on the mainland of India
 aisa anumaan he ki is baar monsoon der se aayega
 According to the Monsoon Department, due to the Ronu cyclone, the monsoon around Andaman and Nicobar reached only on 17 May, but at the same time, the Monsoon dragged along the cyclone towards Bangladesh due to the formation of the Ronu cyclone
 khaas baat yah rahi ki ronu chakravaat ke chalate tamilnadu, andhra pradesh, pashchim bengal or purvottar bharat ke tamaam ilaakon main jhamajham barish record kii gai
 The bad effect of this is that the equatorial monsoon system weakened considerably
 aage nahin bad paaya monasoonaaisi sthiti main puure bharat main hawaaon kii dasha-disha badal gai
 Under these conditions, the humid winds of the Arabian Sea started to enter north India over Gujarat and with this the moist winds from the Bay of Bengal shifted towards north India
 aise main purvottar bharat, uttar bharat or madhya bharat main aandhi ke saath barish kaa silsilaa to ban gaya, lekin isane monsoon ke system ko aage badhane se roak diya
 Monsoon weather will be delayed in Kerala, experts say that at this time it is raining in the coastal areas of Kerala, but these rains are not due to monsoon winds
 mausam vibhaag kaa kahana he ki kerala main monsoon kii barish tab maani jaati he jab dakshin-pashchim disha se aa rahi nam hawaaen barish lekar aaen or ye wedar system lambey samay tak rimjhim barish de

 26 aktubar ko amit shah or jad (you) pramukh tathaa mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne yah ghoshnaa kii ki ve bihar main 2019 loksabhaa chunaav main baraabar siton par ladenge
 The saffron party bowed down considerably
 philhal rajya main uske paas loksabhaa kii sabase zyada siten hai
 The BJP won 22 out of 40 seats in the state in 2014, while the JD (U), which contested alone, won only two seats
 patna main bhaajapa ke ek netaa ne kaha ki nae talmail kaa matlab yah he ki unke kam se kam paanch maujuuda saansadon kaa tikat cat saktaa he
 The NDA currently has 33 seats in the state, out of which Ram Vilas Paswan's Lok Janshakti Party has six and Upendra Kushwaha's Rashtriya Lok Samata Party has three seats
 jad (you) sutron ke mutabik bhaajapa ko yah ghoshnaa karne ke liye majaboor hona padaa, kyonki nitish kumaar ne gathbandhan kii kisi bhi baithak main hissaa lene se inkaar kar diya tha
 Although Shah and Nitish have not yet disclosed any numbers, it is believed that both the parties will contest 17-17 seats
 is tarah algepi ke liye sirf chaar or araspi ke liye sirf do siten bachengi
 Kushwaha was seen trying to deface the Opposition openly, but it seems that the BJP leadership does not care much
 bhaajapa ke kai netaa nijee taur par yah daawa kar rahe the ki unki party jad (you) se zyada siton par chunaav ladegi
 The reason for the bjp's bending is that the BJP relies on Nitish Kumar for good results in Bihar
 bhaajapa ke ek varisht netaa ne kaha, 'chandrababu naidu kaa saath chhot jane ke baad ab hamaara kendriya netritv yah nahin chahta ki nitish jaise sahyogi kaa saath chute
 "of course there is a reason for this for the BJP
 2005 se 2015 ke bich (sirf 2014 main narendra modi lahar ko chhod den to) hue chaar vidhansabha or do loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan jeet usee dhade ko hasil hui jisaki taraf nitish kumaar the
 a senior BJP leader from the state said, "unlike 2014, in 2019 we have to deal with anti-incumbency and disenchantment
" isliye bihar main jeet kaa mauka banaae rakhane ke liye hamen nitish kumaar ko apane paale main rakhana hi hoga
 In fact, a section of BJP leaders consider this strategy appropriate to allow Nitish to lead the nda's Lok Sabha campaign in Bihar
 patna main bhaajapa ke ek varisht netaa ne kaha, ''bihar main nitish kumaar ke saath gathbandhan karne se rajya main modi sarkaar ke khilaaf bane kisi sambhavit anti inkambency se nipta ja saktaa he
 An excited JD (U) leader believes that the bjp's defeat in the Lok Sabha by-elections in Uttar Pradesh and the cooling of the Modi wave has left the saffron party with no option but to go ahead with Nitish Kumar

 After this, Honeypreet was in the punjab-haryana High Court to prepare or surrender anticipatory bail
 haryana police ko haniprit ke silsile main ahm jaankariyaan mili hai
 Police sources say that information has been received about Honeypreet that she is around Chandigarh
 kuch ahm jaankaree mili he, us par ek special team kaam kar rahi he
 There were blockades all around Panchkula
 mahila police dupattey or ghunghat hataakar bhi mahilaon kii jaanch kar rahi he, taaki haniprit chhipakar na nikal sake

 ek mahila dilli kii ek adaalat kii dahalij par jaakar apni jaan de dati he
 With the request that i want justice
 kya milegaa? ab wo to jaan dekar chali gai
 But his question still holds its place
 sitam ye dekhie ki jinke kandhon par insaaf dilaane kii jimmedaari he wo khud hi mulgim ke katghare main khadey he
 Hands useless because arthritis made him sick
 ghar main khaaki vardi ke sawaalon ne balatkaar kiya
 In the police station, the law outraged
 or ghar, thane ke baahar khaaki vardi ne jeena dushwaar kiya
 Just because no other place was found, it ended its own story on the frame of law
 thik insaaf kii dyudhi par apni is aakhri khwaahish ke saath
 i want justice
 kya milegaa?dilli police kii kaali hakeekat kaa ek video saamne aayaa he
 In which an Delhi Police inspector who is also the SHO or owner of a Delhi Police station is questioning a woman in connection with a case
 ji haa
 a male inspector asked a woman all these questions
 kanoon kii dictionari yani ipisi-siarpisi kii tamaam dhaaraon ko apni jeb main rakh kar
 If it came in the form of our own handiwork video of that inspector himself, then we and you also came to know
 is video se baahar is mahila ne puure das maheene kaise kaate ye to hamen pataa hi nahin
 But yes the way it gave its life by going to the threshold of Tis Hazari court of Delhi, it can be guessed that it was easier to die than to suffer the life of this inspector of Delhi Police
 30 april ko rekha ne di thi jaanayun to ye kahani 30 april ko tab saamne ai, jab rekha dilli kii tees hajaari adaalat kii dahalij par jehar kha kar apni jaan de di
 But this story had started ten months before that as well
 kehani ek inspector ke vardi kii rob kii
 The story of an inspector believing himself to be bigger than the law and the story of a woman being questioned so poorly by a police officer that she was forced to die
 30 april ko dilli ke tees hajaari court ke get number do ke kareeb achaanak afratfari much gai
 Actually a girl had fallen after eating gush
 uske munh se jhaag nikal rahaa tha
 Immediately with the help of people, the police took him to the nearby Aruna Asaf Ali Hospital
 lekin tab tak wo mar chuki thi
 He had consumed poison
 ladki ke bag se ek suicide note mila
 Just as soon as this suicide note came in front, all eyes have now risen towards Dinesh Kumar, SHO of Vijay Vihar police station
 choubees ghante ke andar-andar inspector dinesh kumaar ko giraftaar bhi kar liya gaya
 Then he was dismissed from his job within the next 48 hours after the initial investigation
 lekin abhi inspector dinesh kumaar kaa asli cheharaa saamne aana baaki tha
 In fact, before Khudkushikar, on 30 April, this woman named Rekha alias Tanu, whose one hand was not working due to arthritis, went to the Tis Hazari court to meet a lawyer
 inspector dinesh kumaar ke khilaaf shikaayat karne
 She wanted to send that complaint to the court as well as from the President to the Prime Minister
 lekin vakil kaa jawaab sun kar wo noummid ho gai
 After this, he killed himself by consuming poison at the court frame
 pehle bhi likhaa chuki thi reportmagar marane se pehle rekha ne josuicide notelikha usase police ko sachai pataa chal gai
 Investigation revealed that Rekha had written a report to the police earlier as well
 itnaa hi dauraan jaanch ke dauraan police ke haath inspector danesh kumaar ke mobile main shoot wo video bhi mil gaya jo usne poochtacha ke dauraan khud hi shoot kiya tha
 After this, Inspector Dinesh Kumar again approached Rekha
 usase dobaaraa poochtacha kii
 And then recorded everything
 das maheene inspector rekha ko isi tarah lagaataar tang kar rahaa tha
 Even tortured him several times
 or isi vajah se rekha ne apni jaan de di
 Women cannot be called to the police station
 The law clearly states that no woman can be questioned by calling the police station
 na hi shaam chah baje ke baad kisi mahila se poochtacha kii ja sakati he
 But in the case of Rekha, the Delhi Police laid down all the laws
 dilli jaise shahar main ek inspector saream din-raat kabhi bhi kisi vakt ek ghar main ghusata he
 Threatens the family members
 jhuthe cese banaata he
 As a male, he interrogates women alone
 wo bhi ashleel tareeke se
 And all this when the law says that the woman should not be questioned without the presence of a woman police officer
 siarpisi yani criminal proscisger act kii dhara 160 baqayada isi ke liye he
 Inspector Dinesh Kamar used to threaten not only in Rekha's house but also many other people of the area
 ab dekhnaa ye he ki jite ji jo insaaf rekha ko nahin mil paaya kya marane ke baad wo use milegaa? giraftaar ke baad inspector dinesh kumaar ko somvaar ko jamaanat bhi mil gai
