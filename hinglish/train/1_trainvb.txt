 ira ke kariyar kii baat karen to aamir ne ek sho ke dauraan is baat kaa khulaasa kiya tha ki unki beti ira khan ko film mekking main or unke bete junayd ko acting main dilchaspee he
 Let me tell you that Ira Khan is the younger daughter of Aamir and Reena Dutta
 aamir khan ne apni nai film kaa elaan kar diya he
 Recently, on the occasion of his 54th birthday, he told that he is going to work in a film named 'lal Singh Chadha'
 ye film 25 saal pehle ai hollywood actor tom hanks kii lokapriy film 'forest gamp' kaa bhartiya rimek he
 According to the report, Aamir is going to lose 20 kg weight for this film
 yahi kaaran he ki ve farvari maheene main america pahunche the
 He met the famous fitness guru Jeff Cavelier in New York and also exercised with him
 aamir ne khud is video ke dauraan kaha tha ki ve is samay out of shape he
 It is believed that the shooting of this new film of Aamir will start from October
 aise main aamir agle kuch maheenon main apane fitness gols ko puraa karne ke liye ji-tod mehnat karte hue dikhaai denge
 Jeff had also previously made a video on Aamir's Cirque Transformations
 gauratlab he ki saal 2008 main aamir khan ne jab film gazani ke liye 8 pack abs banaae the to industry ke achche-khaase body buildir actors tak hairaan rah gaye the
 It was a result of the hard work of Mr
 Perfectionist that he transformed himself to a fantastic level within a year
 aamir kii body or ection pack gazani kii itani charchaa thi ki ye film bollywood kii pehali 100 karod film sabit hui thi
 After this he became a Haryana wrestler for the film Dangal and gained so much weight that many people felt that Aamir has become absolutely crazy
 mahavir phogat ke kirdaar ko nibhaane ke liye unhone pehle 27 kilo vajan badhaayaa or 95 kilo ke ho gaye
 Aamir has even transformed himself for the films Dhoom 3 and PK, but for Dangal and Ghajini, his level of transformation was like a supermodel or super athlete
 aamir ek baar phir apane aapako transform karne nikle he or mana ja rahaa he ki ve ek baar phir apni fitness se sabko chaunkaa sakate hai
 US President Donald Trump posted on Twitter a photo of the dog, an important role in the elimination of Baghdadi
 The US military piled into Syria the previous day
 bagdadi ke maare jane ke baad ek kutta us vakt tab zyada surkhiyon main aa gaya jab america ke raashtrapati donald trump ne uski photo twit kii or use k9 sainik bataate hue kaha ki isi sainik ne america sena kii bagdadi ko dabochakar maarane main sabase badi bhoomika adaa kii
 The trained dog that Donald Trump posted on Twitter is a Belgian Melinois breed dog
 dilli police ke paas bhi belgian melinois nasl kaa kutta he
 Dogs of this breed quickly pounce on him and hunt him as soon as he sees them
 bhartiya suraksha balon ke saath belgian melinois nasl ke kute (photo-arvind)behad furtile hote hai kuttebelgian melinois nasl ke kute behad furtile hote hai or inkaa istemaal naksal or aatanki oparation main khub kiya jaataa he
 Because of its agile speed, sharp mind, patience and aggressiveness, Belgian Melinois breed dogs are the first choice not only for the US but also for the armies of the world
 bharat main pathankot par hamale ke dauraan enesji ne bhi inkaa istemaal kiya tha
 Training of Belgian Melinois breed dogs costs millions a month
 siarpief naksal oparation main bhi iskaa istemaal karti he
 The specialty of this breed of dogs is that they catch ammo very quickly
 ye ek baar main 30 kilometre tak aasaani se bhaag sakate hai
 Along with Indian security forces, dogs of the Belgian Melinois breed (photo-arvind) were used not only to kill Baghdadi but also Al Qaeda terrorist Osama bin Laden
 jabaki bhartiya suraksha balon kii baat karen tosiarpief, itibipi or enesji samet kai suraksha bal inkaa istemaal bade oparation main karte hai
 In any environment, dogs have always been the target of terrorists and have also been the victim of many big terror attacks
 aisi aatanki vaardaaton ko rokane ke liye belgian melinois nasl ke kutton ko dilli police ke bede main shaamil kiya ja chukaa he jo aatankwaad se jude maamalon main dilli police ke oparation kaa ahm hissaa hote hai
 Male dogs of the Belgian Melinois breed are about 23 to 27 inches in height and 21 to 25 in females
 kisi bhi vaataavaran main ye kute aasaani se dhal jate hai or phir oparation ko apane anjaam tak pahunchaate hai
 These dogs of the Belgian Melinois breed, who hunted the dreaded terrorist like Baghdadi, have proved why they are the first choice of all the military forces of the world? HSSC Recruitment 2019:haryana staff sellection kamishan ne 'gram sachiv' ke padon par bhartee ke liye aavedan maange hai

 ek nae shodh ke mutabik, ye sanket nai brahmadia ghatana ho sakate hai yaa vastav main eliyanon kaa hamase sampark karne kaa jariya
 The research was carried out by scientists from the Institute of Data Analysis in neukirchen-luin, Germany
 is shodh main yah bataaya gaya he ki ye sanket 2007 se milanaa shuru ho gaye the or abhi tak is tarah ke 11 sanket mil chuke hai
 These signs were last detected in 2011
 is shodh menvishesh rup se sanketonke nimna yaa ucch hone ke bich ke samay par dhyaan diya gaya
 The newspaper 'huffington Post' quoted research co-author Michael Hipke as saying, "these signals originated from some elements like supernova explosions

 There was also a debate in the Supreme Court on what kind of stickers should be applied to the new and old vehicles running on 10-15 years old diesel-petrol
 supreme court ne poocha amal kaa taur tarika kaisaa ho? stikar kii rang yojana ke bare main kaha gaya ki blue (petrol / sienji) orange (dijal) or green (bydaree / bijli) ke liye hoga

 a fake transaction of Rs 11,360 crore has been done in a branch of Punjab National Bank, the second largest government bank in the country, in Mumbai
 farjivada kar bank ko chapat lagaai gai yah rakam share bazaar main bank ke kul market capitaliseshan kaa lagbhag ek tihaai he
 Due to this, while the shares of the company suffered a loss of 10 per cent on the stock market, according to an estimate, the common account holder of the bank will also have to face a loss of Rs 30 in its 100 rupees deposited in the bank
 neshnal stock exange ke mutabik punjab neshnal bank kaa kul market capitaliseshan lagbhag 36,566 karod rupee he or usne lagbhag 4
 5 lakh crore rupees has been given in the market
 bank main farjivade ke khabar ke baat bank ke share mulya main ai giravat se niveshkon ko ek din main lagbhag 3,000 karod rupee kaa nuksaan uthaanaa padaa
 How the fraud happened in the bank: On February 5, the Punjab National Bank handed over the case of fake transaction of around Rs 280 crore to the CBI
 is maamle kii jaanch sibiai kar hi rahi thi ki bank ke mumbai sthiti mahaj ek branch se ai farjivade soochna ne bank ko 11,360 karod rupee ke atirikt nuksaan main laa diya
 However, the bank is yet to make it clear that the Rs 280 crore forgery reported to the CBI on 5 February is different from the new fraud or the two cases are connected
 ise padhein: ham dekhte rah gaye or 'new india' se 50 saal aage nikal gaya 'new china'bank se saaf hua kiskaa paisa?aamtaur par kisi bhi bank ke paas do sutron se paise kaa aadan-pradaan hota he
 The first is the customers of the Reserve Bank of India and the second bank, who deposit their money in their account for interest
 haalanki corporate jagat se share holder kaa paisa bhi bank main jamaa rahata he
 In the present case, the bank has reported a loss of Rs 11,360 crore citing fake transactions, so it is clear that this money is not deposited by the share holder
 saath hi na to yah rupaya kendriya rigerv bank ki taraf se cash rigerv reshio ko banaae rakhane ke liye bank ko di gai he
 So, one thing is clear that if someone's money is damaged by fake transactions, then it is the money of millions of ordinary account holders deposited in the bank
 ise padhein: PNB main mahaghotaalaa! frod kar arabon rupee videsh bheje gaye, bank ke share dhadamayadi apni soochna main bank kisi farji tranjaction kaa hawala de rahi he to iskaa saaf matlab he bank ke paas is hone vaale tranjaction kii koi soochna uplabdh nahin he lihaaja vah yah jaanane main sakasham nahin he ki bank se tranjaction ke jariye paisa kahaan pahunch gaya he
 In the absence of such information, it is also very unlikely that the bank is in a position to get back the money lost in this fake transaction
 lihaaja ek saamaanya jod-ghataane se saaf he ki yadi bank ko kul market cap main ek tihaai kaa nuksaan ho chukaa he to isaki bharpai bank ke graahakon ke paise se kii jaaegi
 In such a situation, if a customer has a deposit of Rs 100, then his 30 rupees can be cleared in this fraud

 aaazaad ne kaha ki yah muslim mahilaon ke vivaah se judaa ek ati mahatvapurn vidheyak he or ise pravar samiti main bhej kar is par charchaa karavaaya janaa aavashyak he
 After this, Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Vijay Goel said that this is a very important bill related to the rights of Muslim women and the Congress wants to deliberately block this bill
 isiilie vah ise pravar samiti main bhejne kii maang kar rahi he
 He said that what has happened is that when the Congress supported this bill in the Lok Sabha, it is no longer allowing it to be passed
 unhone vipaksh par is vidheyak par charchaa se bachane kaa aarope lagaaya

 Normally, many of us journalists rush to the office of that party to take a reaction from another political party to a statement made in the office of one political party
 lekin, guuruuvaar ko congress daftar kaa alam aisa tha ki ham ol india congress kamity ke mukhyalay ke press brifing haul main die gaye bayaan par pratikriya lene isi mukhyalay ke duusare kamare kii taraf bhaag rahe the
 Ajay Maken's briefing was still going on that there was a buzz, Janardan Dwivedi coming to his room hai
 Maken had by then repudiated Janardan Dwivedi's statement on Modi
 anushaasanamak karrwai kii sambhaavna par puche gaye sawaal kaa bhi jawaab de chuke the ki leadership jald hi is par koi faisla karegaa
 He had understood the meaning of Indianness, quoting everyone from Indira Gandhi to Jawaharlal Nehru, from Tagore to nanak-kabir
 isliye kai patrakaron kii dilchaspee ab is pisi ke baad janardan dvivedi kii pratikriya jaanane kii ho rahi thi
 One by one all came out of the briefing room and started gathering outside Dwivedi's room
 congress kii is andruni ladaai ko cover karne pahunche More than three dozen cameras had also turned towards Dwivedi's room
 is bich brifing haul se nikal kar maakan apane kamare main baith kar patrakaron se anaupchaarik baatcheet kar rahe the
 It is also important to hear that no such thread of information is missed, so that our garland of news is lacking in interlock
 kya karen idhar sunen yaa dvivedi ke kamare ke baahar hi date rahen
 The dilemma was this
 teesraa rasta tha ki yahaan kii sunata rahun or bich bich main dvivedi ke kamare ke baahar bhi chakkar laga aauun
 There is hardly a 10 second gap between the two rooms
 kuch bhi minuton main janardan dvivedi pahunche
 He got down from the car while talking on the phone and went to the room to tell the angry journalists that he would keep his word at one and a half hours
 lekin patrakaron kii besabri kam nahin hui
 All cameraperson were rambling among themselves to take a better position
 koi podium uthaa kar laa rahaa tha taaki ganamike us par rakhe ja saken
 Then there was a call to come to Dwivedi's room
 tamaam patrkaar ghusane ko tut pade
 The scene was as if the occasion of Chhath par bihar jane vaali train kii jeneral bogi main ek saath darjanon musafir ghusna chaah rahe hon
 We moved to the other door
 wo andar se band tha
 We felt that we were left out
 lekin kisi mitra ne andar se chitkani khol di
 Janardan Dwivedi was sitting quietly in his chair waiting for the clamor of the journalists to calm down
 isamen acha khaasaa 4-5 minute kaa vakt laga
 Then Dwivedi made his point with full force
 brifing haul se aae maakan ke bayaan par sidhe taur par kuch bhi bolne se inkaar kar diya
 But refused to take knowledge of what Indianness is
 media kii samaj or niyat par sawaal uthaate hue unhone un congressi netaaon kii samaj or niyat par bhi sawaal uthaa diya jinhone website par chape Trusted more than Dwivedi said
 kaha taras aati he
 Fear of disciplinary action, ranging from Sonia or Rahul Gandhi's displeasure, politely declined to answer the question
 ek hi party ke bheetar ke do pakshon kii bite ho chuki thi
 Yesterday's news had moved a bit further

 According to reports from Pakistani media, Hafiz Saeed, the mastermind of the Mumbai attack and the founder of lashkar-e-taiba, has been placed under house arrest at the Qadasiyyah Mosque in Chauburjee, Lahore

 Delhi is not taking the name of stopping the pollution level of dangerous levels
 dilli sarkaar od-ivan ko lekar puraa jor laga chuki he, lekin engiti ne use yojana ke mutabik lagu karne kii manjuuri nahin di
 In this entire exercise, it seemed as if the entire focus of the government remained on Aud Even and if it did not apply, then the pollution from Delhi would never end
 aise main jaanane kii koshish kii gai ki agar dilli main od ivan lagu hota, to iskaa pradooshan par kya asar padataa
 The Environment Resource Institute or TERI in Delhi had tested Delhi's air during the last two aud evens and tried to know how much Delhi's polluted air quality had improved during Odd Even
 saath hi jo tatv pradooshan ke liye jimmedaar he, un par od ivan ke dinon kya fark aayaa tha
 Terry's Senior Scientist Sumit Sharma explains that Delhi's air pollution was reduced by only four to seven percent through Aud Even
 ye aankada chaukaaney vaala isliye bhi he kyonki dilli sarkaar pichley puure ek hafte se isi ekplan ko lekar maathapacchikarne main juty rahi
 During this time it was constantly coming from the government sources that if the aud even is not implemented, then the threat of Delhi cannot be reduced
 terry kii research main jo khulaasa hua he, wo hairaan karne vaala to nahin lekin is lihaaz se chaunkaa rahaa he ki sarkaar un vajahon par dhyaan dene ke liye taiyaar kyon nahin he, jo pradooshan main sidhaa-sidhaa yogadan de rahi hai
 Sumit Sharma explains that it is clear not only in Terry but in all other research that many factors work in the pollution caused in Delhi
 masalan, dilli ke pradooshan main khud dilli kaa yogadan chalis fisadi kaa he, iske alaava 20 fisadi pradooshan aasapaas ke ensiaar shaharon jaise noida, ghaziabad, faridabad, bahadurgard kaa hota he, jahaan se industrial gaisen nikalati hai
 About forty percent of the pollution in Delhi comes from the states of far-flung areas, especially in the north, where stubble is burnt on a large scale
 ab dilli kaa pradooshan main jo apanachalis fisadi hissaahai, uskaa postmortem karen, to isamen se ek chauthai pradooshan ke liye dilli main maujuud vaahan zimmedaar hai
 It also includes old vehicles, a big part of this quarter pollution comes from two wheelers
 zaahir pradooshan par siyasat khub hui, lekin kuch aise mudde bhi hai jo raajnneetik dalon kii siyasat ko hawa dene vaale hai
 That is why the debate on the real culprits or causes that make Delhi's air poisonous has been left behind

 aarti ke liye bhi ab nitish sirf uskaa bhai he
 And, the arti that Nitish's parents had brought home as a daughter-in-law with a lot of armament, has now also considered her a daughter and is now preparing to send Aarti off with a boy of her choice
 par is badalte rishte ne phir karavat badali or 29 june ko aarti ek baar phir palat gai
 Her brother Nitish, who had tied a rakhi on 16 June, is now telling her the same brother as her husband
 aarti ab nai kahani lekar saamne ai he
 Aarti said on 16 June, the whole drama of tying rakhi to her husband was done against her will
 sasuraal waalon ne usapar dabaav daalaa tha isliye use ye sab karnaa padaa
 Aarti alleges that her in-laws were harassing her for dowry
 par aarti ye nahin bataa pai ki dahej mangane ke liye bhala sasuraal vaale pati ke haathon apni patni ko raakhi kyon bandhavaayenge? 16 june ko aarti ne kaha tha ki nitish se uski shaadi jabaran karai gai thi
 While she was already married
 vineet naam ke ladke se usne mandir main shaadi kii thi
 But now the same Aarti is saying that she did not get married before Nitish
 vineet se uski shaadi nitish ke gharavaalon ne jabaran haal main karai
 The question is the same again
 masalaa agar sirf dahej kaa he to nitish apni hi bivi kii jabaran duusari shaadi kyon karavaayega? aarti ke paas iskaa bhi jawaab nahin he
 Now Aarti was telling the truth earlier or now
 ye to vahi jane
 But the husband to whom she first tied a rakhi and now she is considering a husband again, now she wants to see the same husband or brother behind bars of jail

 lok janashakti party (algepi) ke rashtriya adhyaksh chiraag paswan ne maharashtra ke taaja raajnneetik ghatnakram ko loktantr kaa majaak qaraar diya he
 Chirag Paswan, the leader of the LJP constituent of the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) at the Center, said that democracy was being made fun of in Maharashtra
 unhone kaha, 'aaj jo paristhitiyaan paidaa hui hai, isse zyada loktantr kaa majaak nahin ho saktaa he
 If i had it in my hand, i would have sincerely demanded a mandate again, going again to the public so that the public would also know with whom you had sought the mandate by staying with it
 ' unhone kaha ki maharashtra main jo bhi paristhitiyaan paidaa hui hai, vah galat he
 Chirag said, 'in Maharashtra, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Shiv Sena had a clear mandate to form the government, but the two political parties did not form the government because of their ambitions and the search for an alternative alliance began
 shivasena ke pramukh (purv) bala sahib thakare apane puure jivan kaal main nirantar congress virdohi rahe

 On the politics of principles, he said, 'lok Janshakti Party is often accused of opportunism, but we have never compromised on the principles
 hamen garv he ki lojpa ne kisi kii sarkaar banane ke liye koi talmail nahin kiya
 The party was formed in 2000, since then we formed an alliance before the election and after the election results, we never supported anyone (other than the alliance) to form the government
 ' bhaajapa ne maharashtra main jis tareeke se sarkaar banaai us par unhone kaha, 'main use galat maanata hum, lekin agar kisi bhi gathbandhan ke paas janadesh (bahumat) he to use sabit karnaa chahie
 The manner in which the BJP formed the government and (devendra) Fadnavis took oath and Ajit Pawar is with them, he calls himself the leader of the legislature party

 On the separation of constituents from the NDA, Chirag said that the separation of constituents is a matter of concern and a coordination committee is needed for strengthening the alliance

 hamaara rishta yaheen tak tha
 Saying this, she leaves you forever
 rah jate hai akele aap or uski kuch yaaden
 Memories of those moments when you and he used to be with each other
 jab aap or wo ek-duusare ke saath hasante-muskuraate the
 When you and he felt each other
 pyaar ke baad brallep kii sthiti badi ajeeb lekin ek kadave sach kii tarah hoti he
 Many times people try to lighten up by resorting to drugs and sometimes people are vulnerable to depression
 mumbai kii relationships export rachana kothaari kahati hai, dekha gaya he ki brallep karne vaale ko utana fark nahin padataa jitna chode jane vaale ko padataa he
 The breaker has paths, but the other partner does not have quick paths
 choda hua vyakti kai baar yah chahta he ki sthitiyaan pehle jaisi ho jaaen or vah apana partner dobaaraa paa le
 In free time, that person spends the memories of those moments which are now gone
 yadi aap bhi aisi hi kisi sthiti se do-chaar ho rahe hai to aapako nimnlikhit baton par vichaar karne kii zarurat he
 Introspect what you want
 The person going through the breakup is more emotional and difficult to think from a practical perspective
 aisi sthitiyon main dhairya se sochane kii behad zarurat hoti he
 It is very important for you to know what you want
 aap unhen chaahate hai yaa unke saath apni nazadikiyo ko miss karte hai yaa aapako unke hone na hone se tab tak fark nahin padataa jab tak wo duusare rishte main nahin bandhati
 "you need to know whether it is a feeling of masculinity in you that is a cause of envy in you," says Jyudith Sils, author of Love Men More, Needing Men Laces
 aap apane andar kii sachai se hi apane partner ko dobaaraa paa sakate hai
 Think deeply at what level you miss them, physical or mental
 yadi aapako maansik str par apni eks kii kami khalati he to aap unhen dobaaraa paane kii koshish kar sakate hai
 Analyze the reasons for the breakup as your relationship went on increasing with time or your relationship was shattered in one incident 
 apane brallep ke kaarnon kaa vishleshan karen
 If your relationship weakens over time, there is not much room for improvement
 agar aapkaa rishta kisi vishesh vajah se tutaa he to aapke bich pyaar kii sambhaavnaaen bachi ho sakati hai or aap positive rahakar apane rishte kii dobaaraa shuruyaat kii disha main kadam badha sakate hai
 Do not make contact with message or phone call
 After breakup, do not try to contact him through phone call or message
 yah use daraa sakati he
 When you are apart from each other, you can understand very well what you want
 aap yah jaan len ki bure-se-bure daur kaa kuch sakaaratmak pahalu bhi hota he
 When everything happens to you the opposite is very frustrating
 lekin, antat isse aapke dil kii haalat main sudhaar hi hota he
 Before the Lok Sabha elections, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka interviewed the elected workers for the purpose of choosing the right candidate for the post of Block, City President
 intervyuu ke dauraan sawaal sunakar kai ummidavaar baglein jhaankate najar aae
 Congress sources said that Rahul and Priyanka interviewed a total of 40 candidates for the presidency of 10 development blocks as part of the ongoing process for the election of 17 block presidents of Congress and five city presidents at Munshiganj guest house on the first day of their visit
 intervyuu kaa saamana karne vaale kuch kaaryakartaaon ne bataaya ki rahul or priyanka ne unase congress ke itihaas, panchayat raaj, upie kii pramukh yojanaon, manaregaa ke phaayde, sanghathan ke vistaar ke tareekon ke bare main kai sawaal puche
 Jitendra Singh, candidate for the post of Block President from Salon, said that this interview was more difficult than the interview for any job
 sangrampur block adhyaksh pad ke daavedaar sabhajit shukla ne bataaya ki intervyuu ke dauraan rahul kam, balki priyanka zyada sawaal kar rahi thim
 Questions started with the question that why did the Congress lose in Amethi in the last assembly elections and why did the Congress weaken? According to Congress sources, the process was initiated on July 12 for the election of block and city presidents on the instructions of Rahul and Priyanka
 unhone bataaya ki ummidavaaron ke ‘intervyuu’ ke liye merit list taiyaar kii gai thi
 For this, according to the Legislative Assembly, a committee was formed of current and former Congress mlas, State Congress and Congress members, who prepared the list of candidates on the basis of seniority and submitted it to Rahul
 sutron ne bataaya ki pehali baar block or nagar adhyakshon ke chayan ke liye party main is tarah kii prakriya apanaai gai he
 The special thing is that both Sasikala and Panneerselvam belong to the Thevar (OBC) community and this is also the reason for their solidarity in terms of caste equations and in the event of a power struggle this votebank is currently only likely to support Panneerselvam
 
 iske chalate shashikala ko siyaasi nuksaan hone kii ashanka he
 But if Sasikala presents herself as the political heir of Jayalalithaa, there is also a possibility of a division of the party in a state of dissatisfaction
 lekin kanoonee rup se party main do-faad ke liye party ke maujuuda 135 vidhayakon main se 90 se adhik ke samooh kii darkaar hogi joki maujuuda daur main sambhav nahin dikhataa
 Secondly, the role of the opposition DMK will become important in that sunset
 uske sahyog ke bina vibhajit kheme kaa satta tak pahunchnaa sambhav nahin hoga
 These speculations are being made because Sasikala has a good relationship with the Karunanidhi family
 tippaniyan The second thing is that the AIADMK mlas will not want to contest the election at any time because after Jayalalithaa, the party does not have any strong leader at the moment to get votes from the entire state and the next elections are to be held after four years
 in sabake chalate centre kii bhoomika bhi ab ahm ho gai he kyonki kisi bhi siyaasi rukh kii sthiti main rajbhavan or rajyapal kii bhoomika ahm hogi
 In such a situation, the AIADMK needs the Center at the moment and the Center cannot be denied the support of the mlas of this party for the Presidential elections to be held in July next year
 aise main centre bhi philhal rajya vidhansabha ke ankaganit main koi pherbadal nahin chahega
 At the same time, in the absence of Jayalalithaa, the vote bank of the AIADMK will now have an eye on the Dravidian parties as well as the Congress and the BJP
 lekin yadi shashikala khud ko jayalalita ke raajnneetik vaaris ke rup main pesh karti hai to party ke ek dhade main asantosh kii sthiti main vibhaajan hone kii bhi sambhaavna he
 But legally, a group of more than 90 of the party's current 135 mlas will be needed for a split in the party, which is not possible in the current era
 duusari baat yah he ki us suuratehaal main vipakshi dramuk kii bhoomika mahatvapurn ho jaaegi
 Without his support, it would not be possible for a divided camp to reach power
 yah kayaas isliye lagaae ja rahe hai kyonki shashikala ke karunanidhi parivaar se achche sambandh hai
 The comments duusari baat yah he ki annadramuk ke vidhayak philhal kisi bhi surat main chunaav nahin chahenge kyonki jayalalita ke baad party ke paas philhal koi aisa kaddavar netaa nahin he jiske dam par puure rajya se vot hasil kiye ja saken or agle chunaav chaar saal baad hone hai
 Due to all this, the role of the Center has also become important because in the event of any political stance, the role of the Raj Bhavan and the Governor will be important
 aise main annadramuk ko philhal centre kaa saath chahie or centre ko agle saal july main hone ja rahe raashtrapati chunaav ke lihaaj se is party ke vidhayakon ke samarthan kii darkaar se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa
 In such a situation, the Center will not want any change in the arithmetic of the State Assembly at present
 vahiin iske saath hi jayalalita kii anupasthiti main annadramuk ke votbank par ab dravid partiyon ke saath-saath congress or bijepi kii najar bhi hogi
 The second thing is that the AIADMK mlas will not want to contest the election at any time because after Jayalalithaa, the party does not have any strong leader at the moment to get votes from the entire state and the next elections are to be held after four years
 in sabake chalate centre kii bhoomika bhi ab ahm ho gai he kyonki kisi bhi siyaasi rukh kii sthiti main rajbhavan or rajyapal kii bhoomika ahm hogi

 CM Yogi, who announced the possession of 50 thousand flats after a meeting with the builders' institution CREDAI on 12 September, said in Noida on Saturday that by December 31, only 40 thousand flats would be occupied
 darasal, 50 hazaar ke aankada kaa daawa cridai se charchaa ke baad hi siem ne kiya tha, lekin noida, greater noida athurities ne tamaam mashkkat ke baad apane target ko hasil nahin kiya
 Only Yamuna Expressway Authority has been able to meet its target of 7500 flats
 50 hazaar flatska target shuruyaat se hi sankat main dikhaai de rahaa tha
 Because the CM quickly announced the figure, but the concessions that Credai had sought to reach this figure were unheard of
 nateeja ye hua ki jaldbaaji main peeth thapthapaane ke liye jo elaan kiya tha wo manzil tak nahin pahunch paaya
 Aajtak had shown the news citing CREDAI in October itself, why the figure of 50 thousand is seen far away from the floor
 4 disambar ko mantri samooh kii baithak main to aankada keval 32 hazaar 500 tak pahunch paaya tha
 After this, the group of ministers led by Suresh Khanna fiercely took a class of authority officials and instructed to raise the figure to 50 thousand by December 11
 baithak main vaade ke baavjoodflaton dene vaale developers ko giraftaar tak karne ke nirdesh police ko die gaye the
 But Senior Police Officer Luv Kumar raised his hand saying that no arrest was possible in any section
 ab 23 disambar ko siem ne khud hi 50 hazaar ke aankade ko ghataakar 40 hazaar kar diya he
 Even if this data is achieved, the issue of possession will remain hanging in noida-greater Noida
 yahaan par amrapali or jepi group ke hi 70 hazaar flats kaa pajeshan baaki he
 Apart from these, many developers, big and small, are still struggling to give legal possession of flats
 yani yahaan par gharon ke pajeshan kaa mudda jald sulajhane ke asaar nahin hai

 PM Modi today claimed that never in the history of Indian elections has such a wave been seen in favor of power as is being seen this time
 haalanki maujuuda chunaav ke bare main unke is daawey kii hakeekat 23 may ko saamne aegi, lekin kya vastav main ateet main kabhi bhi satta ke paksh main koi lahar nahin thi? pichley kuch loksabhaa chunaavon (loksabha Elections) par najar daalen to piem modi ke daawey ke vipareet purv main samay-samay par satta paksh ke badhat lene kii baat aankade sabit kar dete hai
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi today said in Banaras (varanasi) that for the first time in the country, there is a wave in favor of power
 unhone daawa kiya ki desh main ab tak jitne chunaav hue hai unamem aisa pehali baar he ki desh main 'pro-inkambency wave' yani satta ke paksh main lahar dekhi rahaa he
 But is that really so? Has there never been a wave in favor of the ruling party in the earlier elections in the country? We looked at the data of the old elections
 san 1951-52 ke pehle aam chunaav main congress ko 44
 It had 364 seats with 99% votes
 iske baad san 1957 main hue chunaav main congress ke vot badhkar 47
 8% and got 371 seats, i
e
 2 votes of the ruling Congress in this election
 81% bad gaye or saat siten badhin
 Similarly, if we look at the figures of some elections held later, we will find that the seats of the ruling party also increased and the vote percentage also increased
 san 1967 main 40
 The Congress, with 8% votes, won 283 seats and was in power
 baad main party main bikharaav hua or pehali baar madhyavadhi chunaav hue
 In 1971, Congress led by Indira Gandhi with the slogan of 'garibi Hatao' 43
 71% voton ke saath 342 siten jeetin
 That is, the votes of the ruling Congress 2
 91% or siten 59 bad gayi
 We did not count coalition governments in this
 san 1984 ke chunaav ke aankade bhi nahin liye kyonki vah chunaav ek alag paristhiti main hue the
 Was it not a wave in favor of power? If you look at the bjp's scenario in the current Lok Sabha elections, statistics show that the BJP has cut the tickets of its 102 sitting mps in this Lok Sabha election
 yani 37
 7% of mps have not received a re-ticket
 doosraa aankada yah bhi he ki essi-asti saansadon par zyada gaaj giri he
 33 out of total 63 i
e
 52
 3% essi-asti saansadon ko dobaaraa tikat nahin mila he
 While 33 of the general class
 3% saansadon ke hi tikat kaate gaye
 Apart from this, BJP has also fielded a large number of film stars
 agar satta ke paksh main lahar he to phir yah sab karne kii kya jarurat thi? Delhi's Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia may have assured normalization of water supply in Delhi, but this problem now seems to be taking form

 On the water crisis, Sisodia's cleanliness, Delhi's Deputy CM Manish Sisodia had accused the Haryana government of cutting the water coming from the Munak Canal to Delhi, despite the High Court's order that the Haryana government was sending 80 MGD less water
 mangalvaar ko sisodiya ne dilli hai court main avmaananaa yachika daakhil karne kii chetavanee tak de di thi, jiske baad haryana ke chif secretary ne buudhvaar kii dopaher tak pani supplai saamaanya karne kaa aashwaasan diya
 During the press conference at the Delhi Secretariat on Tuesday, Manish Sisodia had alleged, 'pure politics is being done about water
 dilli main pani kaa apana production nahin he
 Water has to be taken from the land, Yamuna or Kanal, which comes from Haryana
 dilli kaa 80 MGD pani roak ke rakhaa hua he, jabaki dilli ko pani supplai karne kaa court kaa order he
 'delhi water crisis is still not resolved

 After this, the Delhi government had requested the LG Anil Baijalco to take cognizance of the PMO
 sisodiya ne press conference ke dauraan kaha, "agar piemo ne sangyaan nahin liya to dilli ko pani milanaa mushkil ho jayega
 All the ministers of the PMO, the center, all the officers of the center also live in Delhi
 sirf nai dilli ke baahar ke nagarikon ke liye nahin balki puri dilli ke liye pareshaani he
 If the water problem is not solved, then during the summer season water cuts will have to be done in the central areas

 i just spoke to LG n requested him to seek pmo's intervention

 The pair began work on the film in 2010

 You expected such a response about PK? Rajkumar Hirani: No
 pike ke dharm-virdohi hone ke aaropon se hamen hairaani hui
 We are in support of religion and only criticize its misuse
 kehane ko itnaa kuch he
 The challenge is that we should not become preachers
 hamane achche se acha karne kii koshish kii, lekin kabhi-kabhi achche se acha bhi kaaphi nahin hota
 How did the two of you start writing together? Hirani: In Vidhan (vidhu) Vinod (chopra) saw a play, a Shaft of Sunlight, written by Arjit
 unhen pasand aayaa or ve apana visiting card unhen de aae
 The two later started working together (arjit wrote the dialogues for Chopra's film closer)
 disambar 2004 main main lage raho munnabhai kaa raf draft sunaane ke liye vinod ke paas gaya
 The aristocracy was also there
 usne kaha ki film kii soch uske dil ke kareeb he, kyonki yah mahatma gandhi ke bare main he or vah ahmedabad main palaa-badha tha
 He asked if he could work on it too? i wondered how that would be possible, because at that time he was living in America
 phir usne mujhe ek drishy likhakar bheja
 It was a bad scene
 usee raat usne ek or drishy likhakar bheja, jo kamaal kaa tha
 Arjit Joshi: Vinod gave me Munna Bhai M

 DVD of was sent
 film puri hone ke baad main tali baja rahaa tha
 i wrote an English screenplay with Vinod, 64 Squares (on which Wazir is being cast as Abitabh Bachchan and Farhan Akhtar), which was read by Raju
 unhen ek kirdaar or ek muhaavara ‘in maai village’ (mere gaanv main) pasand aa gaya
 At that time i did not know that our thoughts would be mixed in this way
 lekin jo idia unhone sunaaya vah itnaa shandaar tha ki main unke saath kaam karne ke liye baichaiyn ho uthaa
 What are the characteristics required to write scripts together? Hirani: Put your ego on one side and stare
 joshigyah sab mujhe karnaa hota he
 Know for sure isamen to ahan naam kii cheez hi nahin he
 Wherever they come from, they listen to every thought
 hiranihshuru main mujhe lagata tha lekhan akele main kiya jane vaala kaam he
 But remember those 10 days of Madh Island, when we wrote together
 isaki madhyavargeey parvarish or college ke anubhav mujhase milte-julate hai
 Joshi: It seems that our idea can often be considered silly
 lekin unhone mujhmen yah aatmavishvaas jagaaya ki koi bhi idia moorkhtapurna nahin hota
 They will laugh at the absurd or will disregard it in a light manner
 hiranisemujhe kuch pasand nahin aayaa, to yah use jabaran gale utaarne kii koshish nahin karata
 At first i used to think that i cannot be tired but it makes me tired
 subah 4 baje ye kahegaa, chalo, paanch minute or koshish karke dekhte hai
 When do you know that the script is now ready? Hirani: You can never be happy with your screenplay
 hameshaa lagata he ki ise or behatar kiya ja saktaa tha
 The need for PK and work was dragged on for so many days
 joshithmain us interior diziner kii tarah mahasoos karne laga tha, jo ghar main daakhil hota he or phir baahar hi nahin nikalataa
 Hirani: We had the most trouble working on PK
 is tajurbe ke baad laga ki agar chah se aath maheene ke bheetar ham patakatha ko sulajh nahin lete to ise chhod hamen kisi or cheez par kaam karnaa chahie
 a few days ago, Arjit called me and said, "I think man, we messed up
" hamen vah drishy is tarah karnaa chahie tha
 "I said," Now it's done, aristocracy
 ” lekin yah aadhe ghante tak bolta rahaa
 i had to say, "now we can't do anything
 ” to isane poocha, ‘dividi main kar sakate hai?”shooting ke dauraan bhi aap drishy ko behatar banane kii jaddojahad main lage rahete the
 Anushka (sharma) was very impressed by this
 hiranishpahale kabhi yah set par saath nahin tha kyonki tab yah america main padhaa rahaa tha
 This time for the first time it was on the set and during editing
 kam se kam koi to tha, jo patakatha ko set par kisi bhi duusare shaks se behatar jaanata tha

 Joshi i remember, when i came to write Lage Raho Munna Bhai, everyone in the office wanted to meet me because they had praised me so much
 bada mjedaar anubhav tha vah
 On most occasions, writers are not respected so much
 is puure dashak ke dauraan mujhe kabhi nahin laga ki ek lekhak ke taur par mere saath kabhi koi chal-kapat kiya gaya ho
 i have started feeling as much right to these films as i would have

 While writing PK we used to go to Kala Ghoda and Gateway of India at 6 am

 Joshi: You cannot assume that they will work only with me
 (agar ve karnaa chahenge to) yah meri khushkismati hogi
 Sometimes i am afraid that they might not be able to say to me that the way you wrote Munna Bhai, you are no longer able to write
 aisa ho saktaa he
 Someday our styles may vary
 us din ke bare main main sochakar hi sihar jaataa hum
 Hirani: i was telling the aristocrat, sometimes i wonder that the day we stop making movies, we really don't know what we are going to talk to each other? What film are we working on next? Hirani: i leave Not giving hamane sanju (abhinayta sanjay dutt) kii kahani jaanane ke liye unke saath vakt bitaayaa

 com / k2m0dlkvnp The fight between the small screen comedy stars Kapil Sharma and Sunil Grover in March led to a split of the team of The Kapil Sharma Show
 sho ke kuch kalakaar kapil sharma ke saath vafadari nibhaate dikhe vahiin kuch unka sho chhodkar alag ho gaye
 Ali Asgar was also among those who left Kapil Sharma
 bataa den ki ali kod kapil sharma shomen daadi ke role main dekha jaataa tha or apane andaaj ko lekar ye kirdaar darshakon ke bich hi nahin cilabrities ke bich bhi mashhoor tha
 By the way, it was believed that Ali had left the show of Kapil Sharma to support Sunil
 vahiin ye bhi kaha gaya tha ki ali ko kapil sharma ke badale ravaiye se kaaphi pareshaani ho rahi thi
 But the truth has now been revealed
 kapil ne todaa tha vadatimesofaindia ko die gaye ek intervyuu main ali ne bataaya ki kapil sharma ke sho main unako jis baat se khaasi naaraazgi thi, vah tha unka kirdaar
 Ali says that the character he was given in Kapil Sharma's show did not have any depth and was not coined well
 ali kaa kahana he ki unhen mahasoos hone laga tha ki log unako daadi ke role main dekhakar bor ho gaye hai or saath hi ab unako kuch or karne kii jarurat he
 Why Kapil Sharma is in depression despite a successful career 
 
 ali kaa kahana he ki kapil sharma ne is kirdaar ke rochak or alag hone kaa daawa kiya tha lekin aisa hua nahin
 Spaceali was not getting on the show, he also alleged that he was called for two minutes at the end of the show and was expected to do something amazing
 ali kaa kahana he ki isi tarah unhone sho par ek saal puraa kiya or ise chhodane kaa man vah sunil grover kii kapil sharma se ladaai se pehle hi bana chuke the
 By the way, this is not the first time that Ali has not rebelled with her character on Kapil Sharma's show 
 kya phir aaenge kapil sharma ke saathye sawaal sabhi ke man main hai ki dakapil sharmasho kii puraani cast ke bich aapas main kabhi sulah ho paaegi? sunil grover to khayr pehle hi kasam uthaa chuke hai ki vah kapil sharma ke saath dobaaraa kaam nahin karenge
 At the same time, Bharti had also done this, but now she is a part of Kapil Sharma's show
 to ali kaa kya iraadaa he?is par ali ne kaha ki unhonekapil sharmaake saath dobaaraa kaam na karne kii kasam nahin khai he
 But he was associated with a ship that was captained by Kapil Sharma
 to kya isse ham ye samajhen ki duubati TRP ko paar lagane ke liye kapil sharma chahen to ali asagar ko aawaaj de sakate hai! The Union Ministry of Health, Government of India has decided that any citizen from neighboring country of Pakistan to any state of India will be given polio drop
 jaankaree ke mutabik pakistan, afghanistan, nigeria sahit 7 desh aise hai, jahaan polio khatm nahin hua he
 Provision has been made to give polio supplements not only to those coming to India from these countries but also to those visiting these countries
 chhattisgarh main bhi is par ehtiyathan kadam uthaae ja rahe hai
 Significantly, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Nigeria, Somalia, Kenya, Syria and Ethiopia are among the countries affected by polio
 bharat main sarvaadhik pakistan, nyeegeria or kenya se log aate hai
 State Immunization Officer of Chhattisgarh Dr
 subhash pandey kehete hai ki centre se disha-nirdesh mila he ki un saat deshon se aane vaale prayek naagarik ko polio kii dawa pilaai jaae jo polio mukt raashtra ghoshit nahin hue hai
 Chhattisgarh attracts maximum people from Pakistan
 unhone kaha ki muslim samudaay ko jaankaree de di gai he ki vah sabhi aane vaale vyaktiyon kii jaankaree den
 The top officials of the particular community have been informed that foreign citizens, people of polio affected countries should not only give information but also take polio medicine by taking them to the district hospital
 yah kadam isliye uthaaya ja rahaa he kyonki 11 farvari ko nai dilli main yojit ek kaarykram main world health organijeshan (dablyuechao) ne bharat ko polio mukt raashtra ghoshit kiya he
 Now if any new matter comes up, the hard work of the last 18 years, billions of rupees and the efforts of the people engaged in this work will go in vain
 soobe ke tikaakaran adhikari ne bataaya ki rajya ke sabhi jila aspataalon main polio virus kaa prasar rokane ke liye polio tikaakaran kii vyavastha kii gai he
 Polio medicine will be administered not only to foreign children up to five years old, but also to every citizen of India who is a citizen of polio affected nation, irrespective of age group

 tivi vigyapanon ko dekhnaa-samajhnaa samajhadaaron kaa kaam he
 The advertisement that you see as related to airlines or real estate, finally shows that they were trying to sell gutka for the last twenty seconds

 Confusion is not just about what girls are doing in men's shaving foam advertisements or why beer bars are being shown in hair gel advertisements, Confusion is also about selling the smallest AC for the life-time How can it happen? But even if someone has troubled the common man the most, it is the advertisement of deodorant
 sara bazaar chaan maarane par bhi awwal to wo deodorant nahin miltaa, jise chhidakte hi bisiyon kanyaayein vastron kaa moh chhod ek maanush kii deh par pil padati hai
 Even if someone is picked up, a dead fly does not bark at her body

 Those who did not take bath, they were bathed with sweat

 The customer does not want to be cheated, starts to understand the difference between gas and deodorant without gas
 idhar graahak gas or bina gas main fark samajhataa he, tabhi aglaa usase puch martha he ek ken main kitne spray? bada sawaal he hamen aise sawaalon ke liye taiyaar rahanaa chahie kyonki aglaa sawaal deodorant main alcohol hone yaa na hone kaa hoga
 At first i could not understand why people do not like alcohol deodorant? Who would not like free alcohol, no matter how they were found? Then it was not understood that applying alcohol deodorant is as wrong as applying male to female talcum powder or deodorant
 galat hi nahin, ghrunit he, sharmnaak he
 At first i used to think that seventeen multiplication table is the most difficult

 But now my eyes have opened
 mushkil kuch he, to bas aisa dio khoj nikaalnaa, jisamen na alcohol ho, na gas, zyada spray hon or mardon vaali mahak ho
 Whatever was the meaning of success before, today it is only successful, who has found dio to meet all the criteria

 dilli se sate noida main ek kabristaan se achaanak murde gaayab hone lage hai
 Someone who digs a grave and takes out the dead
 magar noida kii ye puri kahani jaanane se pehle pakistan ke ek kabristaan kii dahala dene vaali kahani jaan lijie
 a man worked in the cemetery
 par uski najar hameshaa auraton ke janaajon par rahaa karti thi
 As soon as a woman was buried there, she would dig in the evening and dig into the floor
 phir un murda auraton ke saath apni havas puri karata
 After being caught, he himself confessed that he had done so by getting into the tomb with 48 dead women
 sun kar hi rongte khadey ho jate hai
 How sick people are in this world
 dilli ke najadik noida ke ek kabristaan se pichley kuch maheenon se lagaataar laashon kii chori ho rahi he
 People do not turn back after burying their loved ones that the serial thief of the dead steals the corpse
 par churaataa wo sirf bacchon kii laashe hai
 That too within 24 hours of burial
 pichley 10 dinon main yahaan se teen laashen gaayab ho chuki hai or pichley chah maheene main chah se bhi zyada laashen, wo bhi bacchon kii
 After all, what is the secret behind the theft of the dead? This strange sequence of corpses disappearing from the cemetery came to light when a family living in Sector 9 buried the body of their 8-month-old daughter here
 laash dafnane ke liekarib saadhe chaar feet gahare kabr kii khudaai kii gai
 Wrapped in shroud and placed in the tomb with full custom
 hifaazat ke liye patra daalaa gaya or phir mitti daal kar upar cover bhi chadha diya gaya
 So that both the grave and the corpse can remain safe
 lekin agle din jab ye parivaar phir se bacchee ke liye namaaj-e-janaaja padhane pahunchaa, kabr kii haalat dekh kar unke pairon tale jameen khisak gai
 Shroud changed the direction of the investigation
 
 
 kabr khudi hui thi or bacchee kii laash gaayab thi lekin aakhir aisa kaise mumkin tha
 How could one make the corpse disappear overnight by digging the tomb about four and a half feet deep, that too when the cemetery is surrounded by walls on every side and the watchman is present here till eight o'clock at night
 aas-paas kuch kutton ke pairon ke nishaan dekh kar pehali najar main kuch logon ko shaq hua ki shaayad laash kutton ne hi nikaal lee hogi, lekin jis tarah se laash kaa dur-dur tak koi naamo-nishaan nahin tha, usase maamla or ulajh gaya
 Because if these handicaps were of animals, some pieces of corpse or spatter of blood would have been lying around
 lekin abhi peedit parivaar or kabristaan ke chaukeedaar isarhasyamayi vaardatpar baat kar hi rahe the ki namaaj padhaane ke liye aae moulana sahab kii najar ek aisi cheez par padi, jise dekh kar sabhi chaunk gaye
 In fact, near the carved tomb, the baby's shroud was kept folded
 jaahir he, aisa karnaa jaanwaron ke liye katai mumkin nahin tha
 Three dead bodies have disappeared in 10 days
 
 The watchman of the cemetery told him that his suspicions increased
 maamla or bhi zyada ulajh gaya
 This was not the first and only incident of the theft of a corpse from a cemetery
 balki pichley 10 dinon main yahaan se isi tarah 3 laashen kabr khod kar churaai ja chuki thim or chah maheene main chah se bhi zyada
 And by coincidence, the three dead bodies of these three were children only
 maamla behad sangeen tha, isliye bacchee kii laash ganvaane vaala parivaar police ke paas pahunchaa lekin jab police kii tafteesh aage badi to ek ke baad ek kai or chaunkaane vaali baaten saamne aa gayi
 What could be the motive for the theft of corpses? The question arises that what could be the motive of a serial thief behind stealing the corpses? The mysterious process of the disappearance of dead bodies from this cemetery in Noida has been going on for months, but not now
 fark bas itnaa he ki pichley das dinon ke andar ek ke baad ek teen laashen gaayab hone se is maamle ne ab logon ko kuch zyada hi baichaiyn kar diya he
 The situation is that in view of the disappearance of the corpses from here, many families have spent one or two nights in the cemetery after burial
 paharaa tak diya he
 If people are to be believed, during this time, they did not see anything strange in the dark darkness of the country, but when not guarded, the corpses disappeared on several occasions
 or ittefaq se gaayab hone vaali sabhi laashen bacchon kii thi
 That is, whoever is stealing the corpses from this cemetery is not only stealing the corpses of children, but also stealing new corpses
 pehle bhi saamne aa chuke hai aise maamlelaashon ke is serial chor kii yahi modes oprendi ne maamle ko or bhi ulajhaa diya he
 The corpse extracted from this modus operandi can be used in many ways and is at the top of these methods
 bacchon or khaas kar ladakiyon kii laashen churaane ke peeche kisi necrophibic shaks yani aisi vikrut maansikta ke shaks kaa haath hone se bhi inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa, jo laashon ke saath bhi jismani rishta bananaa chahta he
 Go to the old stories of the world of crime, then there have been many such cases in this world, in which necrophobic people have sacrificed dead bodies
 
 
 zyada dur jane kii jarurat nahin he
 
 
 Recently, the serial rapist Ravindra, who was arrested from Begumpur, Delhi, had a similar story, who kidnapped many girls and then tortured them with dead bodies
 thik isi tarah nithari ke mujrim surendra coli ke necrophibic hone kii baat to saamne nahin ai, lekin usne bacchiyon ke saath jyaadati karne kii koshish main unka katl jarur kiya
 Most people are suspicious of tantra-mantra or the disappearance of dead bodies from Kala Jadukbristan
 kyonki laashon ke saath tantric kriyaayein karne ke bahut se maamle jahaan pehle hi saamne aa chuke hai or jis tarah rah-rah kar haal-philhal main dafnai jane vaali laashen gaayab ho rahi hai, zyaadataralogon kaa shaktantrikon kii taraf hi he
 Some people feel that medical training can also be a reason behind the theft of corpses
 ho saktaa he ki kisi medical college yaa institute main bacchon kii training ke liye aisi laashon kaa istemaal kiya ja rahaa he or koi yahaan se laashen chura kar aage supplai kar rahaa he
 Doubt is also towards cannibalism, a genetically deformed person who can eat dead
 jaahir he, is maamle kii tafteesh main philhal police ne saare opshan khol rakhe hai, lekin raaj par se pardaa hatana abhi baaki he
 This may sound strange
 lekin jab puraa maamla hi ajeeb ho to kisi ek baat kaa kya kahana? yahi vajah he ki is kabristaan se gaayab hoti in laashon ke peeche kuch logon ko ek gahari sajeesh bhi najar aa rahi he
 The plot to take people away from the cemetery
 ye bhi ho sakati he ek badi vajah
 
 
 This cemetery in Noida's Sector 18 has been used by people for years
 lekin kabristaan kii jameen ko lekar bhi kanoonee jang chhidi he
 While one side has claimed the cemetery land as its own and wants to stop the dead from being buried, on the other hand, the Intezamia Committee of the cemetery asserts it
 aise main ab laashon ke gaayab hone ke is silsile ke peeche kuch logon ko gahari sajeesh bhi najar aane lagi hai
 They think that perhaps someone deliberately steals the corpses of children as soon as they get a chance from the grave, so that people stop moving to Iskabristan
 or ye vahi log hai, jo nahin chaahate ki is jameen kaa istemaal kabristaan ke taur par kiya jaae
 In the past too, in many cases of crime, many such crimes and such reasons have suddenly come in front of the police, about which no one can usually think, and in such a situation when there is a dispute about the land of this cemetery and some people are found dead
 The suspicion of conspiracy to disappear is also similar
 police ke khufia tantra kii naakaami bhi he ye
 
 
 The police of Sector 39 police station is investigating the disappearance of dead bodies from the cemetery
 ise aap noida police kii naakaami kah sakate hai, maamle ko halke main lene kaa nateeja yaa phir kuch or
 But the fact is that despite the passing of about 15 days, the hands of the police are empty
 or haalat ye he ki kabr main dafn apane maasoom bacchon kii laash ganvaane ke baad ghar vaale insaaf ke liye dar-dar kii thokar kha rahe hai
 They do not even have a single place to read Fatiha for their loved ones
 darasal,kabristaan kii charadivarinhin hone kii vajah se yahaan kabron ke hifaazat naam kii koi cheez nahin he
 In such a situation, as soon as the corpses disappear, usually during the day time people who watch the dogs often break the head of the stray dogs but due to the way the corpses are disappearing, the movements of the dogs behind these cases are less, humans It seems more
 awwal to kutton ke liye itane gahare kabron ko khod kar laashon ko baahar nikalnaa naammumkin he
 
 
 On removing the corpses of dogs or any other animal from above, pieces of corpses are bound to be lying nearby, but here the matter is completely opposite

 Just the hawala players transfer black money worth crores to any part of the country in one stroke
 ajtak ke andercover reporter ne is sachai ko beparda kiya he ki kaise dilli main dhadlle se chal rahaa he hawala racket or kaise ek din main saikadon-karodon ke vaare-nyaare ho jate hai

 In the matter, Khanjan Bhai was asked that crores of rupees, that too of number two, if he will give hairstyle by bringing it to his shop, lest the income tax get messed up

 dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal (arvind Kejriwal) ne shanivaar ko kaha ki rashtriya rajdhani main chaar november se shuru ho rahi sam-visham (odd Even) yojana main mahilaon ko chhot di jaaegi
 This scheme will run till 15 November
 kejariwal ne kaha ki dilli main teesri baar lagu kii ja rahi yojana main nijee sienji vaahanon ko is baar chhot nahin di jaaegi
 However, the last two times CNG vehicles were exempted
 mukhyamantri ne kaha ki jo kaaren mahilaayein chalaa rahi hon yaa jin kaaron main sabhi mahilaayein savaar hon or mahilaon ke saath 12 saal se kam umr kaa baccha jis gaadi main hoga, use chhot di jaaegi
 He said that this decision has been taken keeping in mind the safety of women
 sienji gadiyon ke liye niti main badlaav par mukhyamantri ne kaha, ‘sam-visham ke pichley sanskarnon main, sienji vaahanon ko chhot di gai thi, lekin hamane dekha ki vaahanon ko chhot ke liye sienji stikaron ko kaala bazaar main bechaa gaya or kuch logon ne is yojana se bachane ke liye stikaron kaa durupyog kiya tha
 In this way the objective of even-odd was shaken
 'unhone kaha ki do pahiyaa vaahanon ko yojana ke tahat chhot di jaae yaa nahin is par nirnay kiya janaa he or is par visheshgyon se charchaa chal rahi he
 Kejriwal said that two-wheelers cause pollution and we believe that they should not be exempted under even-odd, but given the number of two-wheelers in Delhi, it is impractical to remove half of them from the roads
 dilli ke paas saarvajanik parivahan vyavastha main itani badi taadaad main logon ko samahit karne kii kshamta nahin he

 ham jurmaane kii raashi par vichaar kar rahe hai
 Transport Minister Kailash Gehlot said that the government will deploy two thousand private buses in service during the odd-even and pay Rs 50 per km for it
 unhone kaha ki hamane ubar ke adhikariyon se bhi mulaakaat kii he or anya cab sanchaalkon se bhi milenge

 They got out of the car and left in a friend's car

 Here i gave him a gift of 57 thousand
 unhone mujhe kisi aise shaks se milaane ke liye kaha, jo unka tabadalaa roak sake

 Indian cricket team's assistant coach Sanjay Bangar believes that in the desire of consistent good performance, captain Virat Kohli has raised his level of play so high that at times his fellow players do not even seem special
 kohli ne australia ke khilaaf tisare vanade main ek or shatak jamaate hue 95 gend main 123 ran banaaye lekin bhartiya team 32 ran se haar gai
 Kohli has scored two centuries and a score of over 40 in this series

 Winning the toss, he also chose fielding because the dew factor was on his mind
 ’unhone kaha, ‘maidankarmiyon ne aisa kaha tha kyonki kal bahut os thi lekin is match main aisa nahin tha
 It was becoming difficult to achieve the goal

 cricket ke sabhi morchon par khoobiyon ke lihaaj se dekhen to bhartiya team vishwa cap kii sarvshereshth team he lekin iskaa matlab yah nahin ki vahi vishwa cap jeetegi
 Taking history, we will always find that only the best team has won the cup, not necessarily; Instead, it means that you played top cricket during the World Cup and yes, when you are in knock-out matches, just a few hours of quick performance gives you the trophy
 sthitiyaan chaahe kisi bhi rahi hon, 50-over vaale formet main bharat awwal najar aata he
 Let us assess India's rivals before assessing their chances in the World Cup
 main bharat ke mukhya pratidwandviyon ke rup main australia, england or newjiland ko chunata hum
 Australia can make any upset in the World Cup
 kuch maheene pehle australian cricket team bikhri hui najar aati thi, lekin achaanak uski vishwa cap kii team behad vyavasthit or majboot dikhti he
 Australia has corrected many flaws and the return of David Warner and Steve Smith makes the team look like a possible champion
 chunki australia kai baar vishwa champion rahaa he or england main shuruaati form main vaapasi ke baad mana jaataa he ki unamem phir se jeet paane kaa bharosa aa gaya hoga
 New Zealand will always be like New Zealand in the World Cup
 utsaahi khiladinnon se saji team, jaahir he apana sarvshereshth hi degi; yadi vah jitati he to ek tarah se chaunkaaegi, lekin koi is baat se inkaar nahin kar saktaa ki saal-dar-saal yah duniya main sabase adhik pasand kii jane vaali team bani hui he
 England's performance is not as expected in limited-overs cricket
 antarrashtriya str par jis nirantarata ke saath england kii maujuudagi rahi he, waisi kisi kii nahin rahi
 But he has nothing to show but the World T20 Championship he won in 2010
 ek divasiy main apane haal ke pradarshan or phir vishwa cap apane hi maidan par hone jaisi vajahon se is baar england ko sabase bade daavedaar ke rup main dekha ja rahaa he
 There is no denying that England have given a lot of attention to their game but they have also seen a tendency to overthink things and complicate the situation
 kisi bhi khel main utkrushtataa tiimon or 1-1 khilaadi se hi hasil kii jaati he jo chizon ko sidhaa-saral rakhte hue apni sooyeeboojh or vyaavhaarik buddhi par bharosa karte hai masalan mahendra singh dhoni
 This is not the same in England, which is why he could not become champion in the world cricket and like the West Indies or Australia
 ab bharat par waapas lauten
 Something really good happened to India's 50-over team after the final defeat to Pakistan in the Champions Trophy in England when Yuzvendra Chahal and Kuldeep Yadav entered the team
 donon team main aae or uskaa abhinn hissaa ban gaye
 Since then, India's winning graph has been climbing
 aswin or jadeja kii spin gendbaaji ke dauraan bharat ko bich ke overon main zyada wicket nahin mil rahe the
 This meant that in the last over, the set batsman always batted, and many batsmen were still left to play
 bharat ke kharaab tej gendbaaj deth overon main andhadhundh ran banaate ballebaajon ko rokane main naakaam rahete the or khel bharat ke haath se nikal jaataa tha
 With the arrival of Chahal and Kuldeep, India took most of the wickets in the middle overs, which means that there is less pressure on the death overs bowlers, including Jasprit Bumra, one of the best bowlers in the world and Mohammad Shami, a re-emerging fast bowler
 Are included
 viraat or bumara ke saath chahal or kuldeep gemeanger rahe hai
 However, it is no longer easy for the pair to take more wickets as the world has understood their bowling tips and the batsmen will not want to take any risk by showing impatience in their overs
 phir bhi ve vishwa cap mishan main bharat ke pramukh hathiyaar honge
 In one-day matches in Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan, India have the greatest batsman to play at number 3, as Virat Kohli, who not only stands for runs, prepares for victory
 is dauraan kai record tut jate hai
 Let us now talk about India's biggest weakness in this World Cup - batting from number 4 to number 6
 bharat bhale hi vijay shankar ko number 4 par utaar saktaa he, lekin 50 overon ke khel main number 4 kii ballebaaji se ve puri tarah se anbhigya hai
 The options are also not very encouraging
 shaayad ye shuruaati sanket hai ki nikat bhavishya main bharat kii ballebaaji kii tulana main gendbaaji main adhik gaharaai dikh sakati he
 In this way, India's former World Cup winning captain Dhoni will step down to bat at No
6
 sabhi jaanate hai ki unke sarvshereshth din peeche chhot chuke hai, lekin ve wicketiper or ballebaaj ke rup main team kii ek badi takat hai
 Dhoni is one of the greatest finishers of the game so far who would still like to carry the game in his own way, but the arrows in his quiver are old today
 yah baat mujhe pareshaan karti he kyonki unka mahaan dimag sochataa he ki ab bhi vaisaa hi kiya ja saktaa he jaisaa hua karata tha
 Unlike 2011, India's most reliable aspect at the moment is its bowling and it has so many options that some bowlers like Bhuvneshwar Kumar may have to rest in some matches
 ballebaaji main bhi bharat kii yahi sthiti hoti to uski team vishwa cap kii sabase pasandida nahin balki ajey team hoti
 *** desh, duniya, mahanagar, khel, aarthik or bollywood main kya kuch hua

 The monsoon movement has started in the Bay of Bengal
 mausam vibhaag ke mutabik srilanka ke paas bengal kii khadi main ek kam dabaav kaa kshetra 14 may tak banane kii puri sambhaavna he
 The weather system will gradually become more powerful once the area of low pressure is created
 jhamajham barish hone ke asarhbengal kii khadi main monsooni hawaaon ko zyada majbootee milane se aisa anumaan he ki barish kii kami se jujh rahe andaman nicobar main is wedar system ke chalate jhamajhambarishho sakati he
 According to m Mahapatra, director of Meteorological Department DDG and Cyclone Center, there has been a stir in the Bay of Bengal
 ye baat to tay he ki ye wedar system 14 taarikh tak kam dabaav kaa kshetra banakar 16 may tak tabdeel ho jayega
 Weather systems around the world are not yet unanimous about the weather system in the Bay of Bengal
 american wedar model ye purvanumaan laga rahe hai ki bengal kii khadi main banane ja rahaa wedar system deep depressant banakar tamilnadu kii taraf jaakar khatm ho jayega
 Due to this, monsoon rains can start in all areas of South India including Tamil Nadu
 agar aisa hua to 20 may se pehle-pehle monsoon dakshin bharat main dastak de degaa
 The Sankyuropean weather model is believed to be more reliable when the cyclone is formed
 european wedar model ke mutabik bengal kii khadi main banane walawether systemdhaare-dhire taqatvar hokar ek cyclone main tabdeel ho jayega
 If this happens, this cyclone will not come towards India and turn towards Bangladesh
 lekin is tarah ke cyclone kii sthiti main bharat ke tamaam ilaakon main joardaar garmi kii ashanka bad jaaegi
 Simultaneously, the formation of cyclone and moving towards Bangladesh will prove disastrous for the monsoon
 in sab sthitiyon ke bich bharat mausam vibhaag abhai puri sthiti par najar rakhe hue he
 It is estimated that in the next 24 to 48 hours this situation will be completely clear whether the cyclone will be formed or not
 isi ke saath hi monsoon ke andaman nicobar main dastak dene kii sambhaavna bhi badhegi
 The monsoon is expected to hit Andaman and Nicobar by May 16
 Another possibility is that the Gulf of Gulf weather system will be strengthened only till the depression
 agar aisa hua to andaman nicobar main 16 taarikh tak monsoon dastak degaa
 With this, the monsoon move will show vigorous pace in South India
 lekin ye sab abhi sambhaavnaaon kaa khel he
 Meteorological Department's DDGM BP Yadav says that it is too early to say anything
 agle do dinon main ye tay ho jayega ki aakhirkaar oont kis karavat baithegaa
 The next 24 to 48 hours are very important for the weather system, the next 24 to 48 hours are very important for the weather system to be built in the Bay of Bengal
 is vakt main bhu-madhyarekha se aa rahi nam hawaaen apana jor dikhaaengi or monsoon ko aage badhayegin
 Due to this, a series of pre-monsoon rains will also occur in many areas of South India
 emsidi chunaav main haar ke baad AAP main koharaam machaa he
 On the one hand, Kapil Mishra, a minister in the Kejriwal government, was seen supporting the questions raised by Kumar Vishwas, on the other hand, Amanatullah Khan, MLA from Jamianagar, has opened a front against Vishwas
 vidhayak kii maane to kumaar vishwaas party main foot daalane kii sajeesh main jute hai
 Warning on Amanatullah Khan's trust, Amanatullah Khan said, 'kumar Vishwas ji wants to grab the Aam Aadmi Party and break the party, he is calling the mlas at his house and asking me to make me the convener of the party or else go to BJP
 bijepi har ek ko 30 karod rupee dene ke liye taiyaar he'
 AAP MLA from Jamia said that i think all this is happening at the behest of BJP and they have left 4 mlas for this work
 ye chaaron vidhayak AAP ke vidhayakon ko kumaar vishwaas ke ghar le jate hai, is baat kii tasdik AAP ke tamaam vidhayakon ne kii
 Not only this, a meeting between these four mlas was also held at a minister on Saturday
 amanatulla khan kii maane to kumaar vishwaas kii tarah se yogendra yadav bhi party ke khilaaf sajeesh rachate the
 Kapil Mishra agrees with the statement of faith, before the allegation of Amanatullah, Kejriwal's minister Kapil Mishra appeared to be favoring Kumar Vishwas
 'aaj tak' se khaas baatcheet main unhone kaha ki party main amul-chul parivartan hoga, kyonki sabhi vidhayak, mantri, kaaryakarta ye chaahate hai
 Those who have been responsible for repeated defeats should sit in the house '
 mantri ne saaf shabdon main kaha ki haar kii sabhi pahaluon kii samiksha hogi
 Also, there should be a churn in the party on the report of the Shunglu Committee
 kapil mishra kii maane to kumaar vishwaas jo bol rahe hai or kejariwal jo twit kar rahe hai donon netaa ek hi baat kah rahe hai
 The activists have got excited after the interview of Kumar Vishwas as he has given a platform to the voice of the activists
 MCD haar par vishwaas kaa morchadarasal 'aaj tak' se baatcheet main kumaar vishwaas ne kaha tha ki AAP congress hoti ja rahi he
 If Kapil believes, Kumar Vishwas has given this statement in anger, because the ideology of AAP is anti BJP and Congress
 kapil mishra ne kaha ki sargical strike par kejariwal ne sahi sawaal uthaaya tha
 Only the Aam Aadmi Party can speak courageously against Narendra Modi in the country, and we will keep speaking even further
 haar par ab samiksha kii batakapil mishra ne ek sawaal ke jawaab main kaha ki kumaar vishwaas se punjab, dilli main prachaar nahin karaayaa gaya or hamaari haar hui, isaki bhi samiksha hogi
 The minister assured that a big change in the Aam Aadmi Party is sure
 unhone party main tut kii baat se saaf inkaar kar diya

 Earlier, rising prices of petrol and diesel were in the news
 tel kii keemat aasmaan chhu rahi he 
 
 janata pareshaan he, sarkaar se ummid baandhe he ki shaayad sarkaar hi kuch raham kar de
 But the central government refused to give any relief
 abhi jo petrol kii keemat he us par kendra sarkaar kareeb 20 rupee exise tex leti he jabaki rajya sarkaar 17 rupee waite ke rup main vasuulati he
 
 
 While the real price of a liter of petrol is around 40 and a half rupees
 isi tarah dijal par kendra sarkaar 15 rupee kaa tex leti he to rajya sarkaar 10 rupee kaa
 While the price of one liter diesel is around 44 rupees
 soshal media sahit baaki jagahon par sarkaar kii kaaphi aalochana hone lagi ki aakhir kendra or rajya sarkaar apana tex kam kyon nahin karti
 After that, some state governments reduced the price by a few rupees per liter
 logon ne soshal media par bijepi netaaon, jisamen pradhanmantri bhi shaamil the, ke puraane video daalane shuru kar die ki upie ke jamaane main jab tel ke daam badhate the to ve kya bayaan dete the
 In a way, the government looked backward on social media
 
 The other big news this week was the steady decline in the rupee against the dollar
 rupaya ludhakte-ludhakte 72 rupee ke paar chalaa gaya
 The government again came a statement that we cannot do anything on this, it is happening due to the global situation and the dollar is getting stronger against every currency
 soshal media par phir puraane video kii baadh aa gai ki manmohan singh ke samay kis tarah bijepi netaaon ne kya-kya bayaanbaji kii thi
 In fact, the BJP and the Prime Minister themselves had made the rising price of oil and fall of rupee an election issue in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 phir ek khabar ai rigerv bank ke purv governor raghuram rajan kii taraf se ki upie ke samay sabase zyada kharaab bank lone udyogpatiyon ko diya gaya
 There was a ruckus on it
 bijepi or soshal media congress ke peeche pad gaya
 But later it was also revealed that more loans have been given at the time of the current NDA
 is par bhi bijepi or congress kii tu tu-main main shuru ho gai
 Then comes a video of absconding Mehul Choksi in which he is seen crying and accusing the government of cheating him

 abhi jo petrol kii keemat he us par kendra sarkaar kareeb 20 rupee exise tex leti he jabaki rajya sarkaar 17 rupee waite ke rup main vasuulati he
 
 
 While the real price of a liter of petrol is around 40 and a half rupees
 isi tarah dijal par kendra sarkaar 15 rupee kaa tex leti he to rajya sarkaar 10 rupee kaa
 While the price of one liter diesel is around 44 rupees
 soshal media sahit baaki jagahon par sarkaar kii kaaphi aalochana hone lagi ki aakhir kendra or rajya sarkaar apana tex kam kyon nahin karti
 After that, some state governments reduced the price by a few rupees per liter
 logon ne soshal media par bijepi netaaon, jisamen pradhanmantri bhi shaamil the, ke puraane video daalane shuru kar die ki upie ke jamaane main jab tel ke daam badhate the to ve kya bayaan dete the
 In a way, the government looked backward on social media
 
 The other big news this week was the steady decline in the rupee against the dollar
 rupaya ludhakte-ludhakte 72 rupee ke paar chalaa gaya
 The government again came a statement that we cannot do anything on this, it is happening due to the global situation and the dollar is getting stronger against every currency
 soshal media par phir puraane video kii baadh aa gai ki manmohan singh ke samay kis tarah bijepi netaaon ne kya-kya bayaanbaji kii thi
 In fact, the BJP and the Prime Minister themselves had made the rising price of oil and fall of rupee an election issue in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 phir ek khabar ai rigerv bank ke purv governor raghuram rajan kii taraf se ki upie ke samay sabase zyada kharaab bank lone udyogpatiyon ko diya gaya
 There was a ruckus on it
 bijepi or soshal media congress ke peeche pad gaya
 But later it was also revealed that more loans have been given at the time of the current NDA
 is par bhi bijepi or congress kii tu tu-main main shuru ho gai
 Then comes a video of absconding Mehul Choksi in which he is seen crying and accusing the government of cheating him
 bhale hi koi bhi uske aansuon par bharosa nahin kar rahaa, magar vah bhi media main bharpoor jagah kha gaya

 sarkaar kaa phir bayaan aayaa ki ham is par kuch nahin kar sakate, yah vishwavyaapee halaat kii vajah se ho rahaa he or dollar har karency ke mukaable majboot ho rahaa he
 On social media, there was a flood of old videos about how the BJP leaders had made some statements during Manmohan Singh
 darasal bijepi ne or khud pradhanmantri ne 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main tel kii badhati keemat or rupee kii giravat ko chunavi mudda banaaya tha
 Then a news came from Raghuram Rajan, former Governor of the Reserve Bank, that the worst bank loans were given to industrialists during the UPA
 is par bavaal much gaya
 BJP and social media fell behind Congress
 magar baad main yah bhi pataa chalaa ki maujuuda endie ke samay usase zyada lone diya gaya he
 On this too, the BJP and the Congress's Tu tu-main i started
 phir faraar mehul chaukasee kaa ek video aa gaya jisamen vah rota dikh rahaa he or sarkaar par fansaane kaa aarope laga rahaa he
 Even though no one is trusting his tears, he too has eaten up a lot in the media
 
 It is not yet week that Vijay Mallya met Finance Minister Arun Jaitley in 2016 before fleeing India, saying that the biggest bomb blasts of the news was
 yah khabar aisi thi jo bijepi ko na to nigalate ban rahi or na ugalate
 Jaitley Ji's instant statement came that i had met Mallya for only 40 seconds
 
 But in the political perception, the damage to the BJP was done
 soshal media phir sarkaar ke peeche lag gaya
 The government once again appeared on the backfoot
 duusare din congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi or vijay maalya ke sambandhon or congress dwaara kingfisher airlines kaa muft main istemaal karne kaa aarope lekar bijepi aa gai
 On this, the Congress President himself appeared in a press conference and this time a witness had also brought PL Punia
 puniya ne khulaasa kiya ki jab jetali or maalya kii mulaakaat ho rahi thi to ve sansad ke central haul main maujuud the or unki mulaakaat paanch minute se lambii chali thi
 Punia claimed that if the government wants to make public the CCTV camera footage of the Central Hall and make it public, this will clear the whole thing
 punia ne kaha ki yadi unki baat sach nahin hui to ve raajnneeti se sanyas le lenge
 The comments ab sarkaar ek baar phir back foot par aa gai he or phir soshal media uske peeche padaa he
 
 
 Today, in the social media that is perceived to be under control or used, BJP seems to be lagging behind
 usee kii dawa kaa istemaal congress usee ke khilaaf kar rahi he
 And the biggest thing is that the week is not over yet, let's see what happens next

 The dates of Lok Sabha Election (lok Sabha Election 2019 Date, Schedule) have been announced

 Chief Election Commissioner Sunil Arora announced it in a press conference
 chunaav kii tarikhon ke elaan ke saath hi congress ne bijepi ke khilaaf hamalavar rukh or tej kar diya
 Rajasthan Chief Minister and senior Congress leader Ashok Gehlot said that the manner in which Modi dealt with the opposition and constitutional bodies, it seems that the country and the constitution are in danger
 5 saal main modi ne aisi koi baat nahin kahi jo logon ko chooti ho, vah latake-jatke ke saath baat karte hai jaise koi actor acting karata he, us rup main modi ne khud ko pesh kiya or karodo rupaprachaar main phoonk die
 He said that Modi would have been more successful if he had been an actor of Bollywood
 kaam kya kiya iskaa kuch pataa nahin
 Referring to Rahul Gandhi, Gehlot said that Modi sees Rahul Gandhi even in his dream, day and night cursing Rahul Gandhi and his family
 23 may ko desh main nai sarkaar banegi, badlaav kaa vakt aa gaya he
 According to CM Gehlot today there is an atmosphere of fear and terror
 log phone par baat nahin karnaa chaahate
 There is talk on whatsapp
 media ke sawaal par jawaab dete hue unhone kaha ki tarikhon ke elaan ke baad media ko bhi dabaav se nikal kar kaam karnaa chahie
 If Modi runs the pre-2014 speeches, the Congress does not need to campaign
 unhone kaha ki modi dwiarthi baat bolte hai, jo pradhanmantri ko shobhaa nahin detaa
 They accuse the military of doubting bravery
 ye galat he
 After Pulwama, Rahul said that we are with the government
 modi ko vipaksh kii bhoomika kii saraahna kerani chahie
 While he is distracting to win the election
 agar duniya air strike par sawaal uthaa rahi he to vipaksh kaa kaam he sawaal poochna
 Amit Shah is giving the figures while the Chief of Air Force did not give any figures
 chunaav kii tarikhon ke elaan main hui deree ke liye gahalot ne piem modi ko jimmedaar tehraaya
 He said that the intention of the Election Commission was to announce the election on the 4th but it was delayed due to Modi's inauguration program
 gathbandhan chunaav se pehle bhi hote hai or baad main bhi
 There will be an alliance according to the need
 espi-bispi agar apana hit dekh rahe hai to hamen uski saraahna kerani chahie
 At the same time, the Congress general secretary also targeted BJP and PM Modi
 unhone kaha ki aaj congress or vipaksh ekajute he
 We are confident that we will defeat the Modi government
 ye sarkaar har vaada puraa karne main naakaam rahi he
 15 lakh in the account, increasing the income of the farmer, employment, women security, the government is failing on all front
 ise dhakne ke liye farji propogenda kiya ja rahaa he
 He said that this government has done the work of dividing people through communal policies
 ham logon ke paas jaakar apni baat rakhenge
 The time has come for change
 23 may ko log nai sarkaar chunenge
 Venugopal said that Modi is the only prime minister who neither takes responsibility nor has removed the manifesto from his website because he did not fulfill the promises

 To remove one problem of people, give them another problem, this problem cannot be solved

 Why you can see the film 'shubh Mangal Savdhan' trailer is full of double meaning jokes- If the story of any film is good and it is mentioned well in the first trailer, then the audience definitely goes to see it and There is also the story of some auspicious Mars cautious
 - film kaa diarection acha he or aar es prasanna ne kahin se bhi yah lagane nahin diya ki yah unki pehali hindi film he
 The background, camera work as well as the location of the film are good, which do a complete justice to the story
 - hitesh cawalia ke likhe hue dialog bahut hi umdaa he jo aapako hansane par vivash karte hai or saath hi saath ek bahut hi ahm baat hansate khelte hue kah jate hai
 You must have heard the story of Alibaba and 40 thieves, but after watching the film, whenever you mention Alibaba and 40 thieves, you will definitely remember the auspicious Mangal Savdhan movie
 - ayushmaan khurana ne acha abhinay kiya he isi ke saath-saath bhoomi pednekar bhi sahaj abhinay karti hui najar aati he
 Seema Pahwa and all the other characters were very good actors
 - film kaa sangeet acha he or khaas taur par saiya saiya or kanha vaala gaanaa acha he, baaki gane bhi thik-thaak hai
 Weak links: The film is very good till the interval but the film also drags a little in the second half which could have been repaired
 - isi ke saath film kaa clymex bhi badhiya banaaya ja saktaa tha
 Because it was revealed from the trailer itself that the film finally draws attention to an important issue, but after the intermission, there was a search for some surprise as a viewer which is not found in this film
