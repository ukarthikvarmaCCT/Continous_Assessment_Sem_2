 Renowned poet Munawar Rana resigned as chairman of Uttar Pradesh Urdu Academy on Monday
 vah mahaj saadhe teen maheene pehle hi academy ke adhyaksh banaae gaye the
 He has clearly cited the resignation as corruption in the academy
 haalanki, is istife ko ek prabhaavshaalee mantri kii dakhlandaji or andruni khinchataan ke parinaam ke rup main dekha ja rahaa he
 The state government formed Urdu Academy on February 5 this year
 jisamen munwwar rana ko adhyaksh va navaj devbandi ko chairman niyukt kiya gaya tha
 Rana attempted to speed up the functioning of the academy
 haalanki, safal na ho sake
 Sources say that the indirect intervention of an influential minister began to drag on the chairman and chairman
 kaha jaataa he ki chairman ne adhyaksh ke faislon main pherbadal karnaa shuru kar diya
 Which led to further escalation
 chairman ko mantri kaa varadahast hasil hona bataaya jaataa he
 After sending the resignation to Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, Munawar Rana said, 'there is corruption all around in the academy
 kuch log shaayaron, lekhakon kii madad or yojanaon main bhi party fund ke naam par vasuuli kar rahe hai
 Due to this, the award of poets and writers has not been distributed for years
 shaayaron kii bevaa ko pension jaisi samvedansheel yojana par adngebaaji kii ja rahi he
 The staff at the academy is already small
 upar se do karmchaaree pramukh sachiv bhashaa ke ghar par tainaat hai
 The academy spends more than ten thousand rupees every month on the taxi of the principal secretary language
 sanvida par kaam kar rahe karmchaariyon main se zyaadaatar ek-duusare ke rishtedaar hai
 'munawwar Rana also said that the position given to him was shorter than his stature
 urdu kii seva ke liye unhone yah pad sweekaar kiya tha
 In his short tenure, he never worked in the chair of the president
 na hi academy se koi suvidha lee thi
 Since he was not in a position to take decisions for the benefit of those engaged in the promotion of Urdu, he preferred to resign
 unhone kisi kaa naam lene se inkaar karte hue kaha ki mukhyamantri agar kuch jaananaa chahenge to vah unhen puri sthiti jarurat bataaenge
 On the other hand, the chairman of the academy, Nawaz Deobandi, says that the president has no business
 phir bhi vah unke prastaavon par amal kar rahe the

 in When a passenger landed at the New Delhi railway station and asked the auto driver to go to the Kashmiri gate, instead of downing the meter, negotiation did not happen, but when the camera peeked, the tone of the auto changed
 kaha hamase to baat hi nahin hui
 The reality is that wherever you want, auto people go there
 bina camere or mike ke hamane bhi teen auto waalon ko conot place se sangam vihaar jane ko kaha, lekin baat khaali gai
 Not even in me, the special thing is in the mic and the camera
 inkaa saath chhutate hi ham bhi khaas se aam ho gaye
 Auto owners say yes or no to their wishes, but in Delhi, if you see an on board duty on an auto, then it means that it will run on your own will, not on your own free will
 tippaniyan The auto driver cannot refuse when on duty
 phir bhi vah na maane to aap 42400400 kii helpline par shikaayat darj kara sakate hai, uskaa chaalaan cat jayega
 In the new law, the exemption for the auto driver is only while returning home, but even then he will have to take two precautions
 upar of duty kaa board lagaana hoga saath hi us ilaake kaa naam bhi likhaa hoga jis ore vah laut rahaa he
 Rakesh, who drives an auto on Minto Road, says that this initiative is also good for us
 kam se kam ghar jane ke vakt kisi sawari ko manaa karne par hamaara chaalaan to nahin kategaa or na hi koi shikaayat hi karegaa
 At present, this board has not been installed on all the autos in the capital, but the campaign has started and action is also being taken on the complaints
 june-july ke dauraan helpline ko sawari bithaane se inkaar kii 1093, overcharging kii 570 or budtamiji se pesh aane kii 174 shikaayatein mili
 In view of this, a total of 5306 challans were deducted by the Transport Department and 1500 autos were also seized

 on duty hone par auto vaala manaa nahin kar saktaa
 If he still does not agree then you can lodge a complaint on the helpline of 42400400, his challan will be cut
 nae kanoon main auto vaale ko chhot sirf ghar lautate vaqt he, lekin tab bhi use do ehtiyaat baratane honge
 The board of off duty will have to be put up as well as the name of the area to which it is returning
 minto road par auto chalaane vaala rakesh kahata he ki yah pahal hamaare liye bhi acchhee he
 At least when we refuse a ride at home, our challan will not be deducted nor will anyone complain

 a day before the Land Acquisition Bill was brought to the Lok Sabha for discussion and passage, the government on Sunday indicated to the opposition that it would bring a government amendment to change the term private entity (private entity) to private enterprise (private enterprise)
 
 is kadam se nijee kshetra ke un logon par ankush lag sakegaa jinaki yojana bhoomi adhigrahan kii he
 There was a concern that a private person may present himself as a 'private entity' for the purpose of acquiring land for a college or an institute etc

 input: bhashaa Ashmit Patel and her girlfriend actress Mahek Chahel are currently spending holidays with the family in Europe
 lekin jo khabar ai he wo chaunkaane vaali he
 After dating for almost two years, the couple got engaged in Spain
 bombai times se baat karne hue ashmit ne kaha ki wo aane vaale 6 maheenon main shaadi kar lenge
 Whereas Ashmit wants to get his marriage abroad, then Mehak's wish is to get married only in India
 in donon kii 12 saal pehle hui thi lekin donon ne 2015 se ek duusare ko date karnaa shuru kiya
 Last year, this celebrity couple took part in the TV show Power Couple
 family ke saath holiday par hai ashmit-mahak, kya shaadi kii he planningkuca reports kii maane to donon ek duusare ke parivaar se mulaakaat kar chuke hai
 Ashmit told the Bombay Times that he wanted to propose Mehak in Paris
 lekin spain main chhuttiyaan bitaa ne ke dauraan marbela ke ek restaurant main baithe the jahaan kaa najaara itnaa romantic tha ki unhen laga ki yahi sahi samay he
 After this Ashmit proposed the smell
 apane instagram acount par ashmit ne prapojal kii photo bhi share kii
 Riya Sen's sex video was leaked, intimateshe said YES with Ashmit Patel !!! @maheckchahal # downonmyknee # engagement # ring # butwhichfinger # partnerforlife # bae # yesididit # aboutlastweeka post shared by Ashmit Patel (@ashmitpatel) onaug 18, 2017 at 12:55 am PDT Mehak says she was a surprise and started laughing happily
 hamen pataa nahin tha ki anguthi kis haath kii ungali main pahanaai jaati he
 So we stopped for a while and after that Ashmit proposed to me on my knees which was very romantic proposal
 mahak kaa kahana he ki donon kii families jald hi shaadi kii taarikh tay karengi
 Whenever you are looking at the picture of the anger of the crowd in any matter, it is difficult for us to guess what you are thinking, you become numb or it does not matter
 tarah tarah kii ghatnaon main bheed kii tasviir bhi banaai ja rahi he taaki viral ho sake
 The creator of the video is confident that nothing will go wrong with him
 video na banaae to ham aap tak baat hi nahin pahonchegi ki kisi kii hatya is tarah se kii gai he
 When such an incident comes to the fore, the condemners do not back down
 magar chup rahane waalon kii taadaad itani badi hoti he ki kai baar shaq hone lagata he ki kahin yah chuppi bheed kii hinsa kaa saport to nahin he
 The failure is that such incidents are not halted
 24 saal ke tabarez ansaari ko saat ghante tak bijli ke khambhe se baandh kar maaraa jaataa rahaa
 How much anger will be there in the mind of the killer, how much hate will be there that he keeps killing a person to the extent of killing him
 aarope he ki tabarez motorcycle churaate pakadaa gaya tha
 Forget for a minute that the one who shoots is the tabrez and the one who kills is Pappu Mandal
 maarane kaa video banane or bheed kaa khadey hokar tamaasha dekhne waalon ko bhi bhul jaaiye
 Now you remember how many such videos you must have seen, somewhere if a master is killing a student of a school, then somewhere the parents are burning their children together because they have broken caste and married by their own free will
 har tarah ke video se aap saamaanya ho chuke hai
 Then who is to expect that he will be restless after watching these videos
 hota ulta he
 The reaction that comes after watching this video is really a must read
 koi puch rahaa hoga ki bengal main aisi hinsa hui nahin bole, koi likh rahaa hoga ki maar khaane vaala chor tha
 Like we have become Arabs instead of India where the punishment of crime is stoned
 ab aap sochie ki jab tabarez khambhe se baandh kar maaraa ja rahaa hoga to vah kya soch rahaa hoga
 Now he will not be in a hurry and his video will go viral
 agar naam se logon ko dikkat he to tabarez kaa naam rakesh rakhkar dekhie
 What difference does it make then
 shaayad nahin
 Because you keep watching the days that a Scheduled Caste boy was burnt alive
 kisi ladki ko balaatkaar ke baad jala diya gaya
 When the car collided, two people got down and killed someone
 doctor par gussa aayaa to vahiin par bheed ne gher kar maar diya
 In anger and whims, when it is found that Jai Shri Ram also has to speak, Jai Hanuman has to speak because the person who is killed is Tabrez, then think about which society this man is a part of
 kya yah jai shri ram isliye bulavaa rahaa he kyonki yah tabarez he yaa isliye bulavaa rahaa he ki ise maarane ke baad police se lekar tamaam log iske saath aakar khadey ho jaaenge
 Has the new political license taken the name of Jai Shri Ram after the cow or have we become ill
 khud ram kaa naam nahin le rahe hai, kisi or se bulawaane ke liye us par jaanaleva hamalaa kar rahe hai
 i assume that before watching this video, you have seen many such videos and you have become normal
 yah video tabarez kii maut kaa nahin he
 There is a video of the death of civil society
 bahut se patrkaar yahaan tak kah rahe hai ki usne chori kii thi isliye bheed bekaabu ho gai
 In the same way, we keep searching for arguments to justify the murder and keep on encouraging the crowd
 jaise chori ke maamle main kisi ko pakad len to khambhe se baandh kar kai ghante tak maarthe rahen taaki vah zindaa na bache
 The police say of investigation but what will happen when the accused get out of jail and they are seen feeding a minister laddu
 hamaare sahyogi harbans ne bataaya he ki tabarez apni hi bike par do doston ke saath jamshedpur se aa rahaa tha
 Kadamdiha was his village
 gaanv se teen chaar kimi dur gaanv vaale bike savaar ko pakad lete hai ki chori kii bike he
 The two friends escape and Tabrez catches up
 police jaanch kar rahi he lekin sochie ki agar bike tabarez kii hi nikalati he to phir yah gunaah kis khate main jayega
 Tabrez was married to Shaista two years ago
 tabarez ke maa baap nahin hai
 Tabrez's family does not believe in the theft charge
 unka kahana he tabarez pune main kaam karata tha
 Came home on Eid

 police agar tabarez ko hawalat kii jagah aspataal le gai hoti, uski chot kii gambhirtha se jaanch karaati to kya pataa batch jaataa kyonki jab mara tab vah police ke hawaale tha
 SP Saraikela has issued a statement that 'on 18 June people of Dhaktidih village caught Tabrez Ansari entering Kamal Mahato's house
 raat ke dhai baj rahe the
 Tabrez was accompanied by two more people
 tabarez pakadaa gaya or use maaraa gaya
 Police received information at five in the morning, reached the spot and was given first aid
 chori kii bike baraamad kar lee he
 The villagers also filed an FIR against Tabrez and his two accomplices
 use zila aspataal main ilaaj ke baad nyaayik hiraasat main bhej diya gaya
 On the morning of 22 he fell ill
 sadar aspataal le jaaya gaya jahaan wo mar gaya
 Tabrez's family has filed an FIR against Pappu Mandal and others
 use giraftaar kar liya gaya he
 On the morning of 24, Kamal Mahato, Premchand Mahli, Bhim Mandal and Sonamu Pradhan were also arrested
 bheed kii hinsa par supreme court ne baqayda ek guideline banaai he
 By the time the Supreme Court gave its verdict last year, the mob had attacked 66 times in 18 months and 33 people were killed
 india spend kaa yah aankada he
 During this hearing, the court has said that the punishment for murder by the mob should be fixed and Parliament enacted the law
 kya sansad ne kanoon banaaya he? kya sansad ko turant is par kanoon nahin bananaa chahie tha, supreme court kaa aadesh to july 2018 kaa he
 The Supreme Court has also set guidelines to stop mob lynching which is to be implemented by the Central and State Governments within four weeks
 rajya sarkaar har zile main police adheekshak yaa usase upar ke adhikari ko nodel afasar banaae
 To help this nodal officer, a DSP should be deployed in every district, whose job will be to assess and control the situation of mob killing
 har zile main task force bane jo bheed ke bare main khufia jaankaree jutata rahe
 The state government should identify such districts, sub-divisions and villages
 jahaan pichley paanch saal main bheed kii hinsa kaa ateet rahaa he
 State Government should issue guidelines for the nodal officers of such districts
 un ilaakon main es ech o str kaa police adhikari vishesh rup se satark rahe
 The Supreme Court has also said that the Center and the state government against lynchings should disseminate this widely through radio and television and other media forums, on the website of the Home Department and Police Department that the murderers join the mob Will be severely punished kya aisa prachaar prasar aapako dikh rahaa he?yah centre or rajya sarkaar kaa kartavya hoga ki vah soshal media par failaae ja rahe bhadakaau bayanon, messejon, video par nazar rakhe
 Stop them from spreading, which is likely to cause a mob flare up
 ek maheene ke bheetar rajya sarkaron ko hatyari bheed ke shikaar peediton ke muaavze ke liye nitiyaan banaaegi
 Assessment should be based on the nature of physical and psychological injury, loss of employment due to injury, etc
 hatyari bheed se sambandhit cese kii sunwaayee ke liye alag se fast trek court bane or chah maheene main sunwaayee puri ho
 The Honorable Supreme Court should now take a report on whether those guidelines have been implemented in the states and districts
 sarkaron ne disharnidesh ke aadhaar par notification to jari kar diya, lekin kanoon or muaavze kii niti par kya states report he
 The Jharkhand government had issued the guidelines following the order of the Supreme Court, but advocate Hemant Kumar, who litigates such cases and is a member of the Bar Council, says that the Supreme Court guidelines in Jharkhand are not being implemented properly
 aakhir kin rajyon ne supreme court ke dishanirdesh ke aadhaar par kanoon banaae hai to jab hamane sirf manipur kaa hi naam mila
 In September 2018, 26-year-old Farooq Khan was killed by a mob in West Imphal as he suspected that Farooq had stolen the bike
 is ghatana kaa jo video bana tha usamen chaar pulicekarmi vahiin khadey hokar dekh rahe the
 One of these sub-inspectors was also there
 police ke saamne bheed ne farrukh ko maar diya
 There were many dharna demonstrations in Manipur after this incident
 tab jaakar vahaan kii rajya sarkaar ne supreme court ke dishanirdeshon ke aadhaar par kanoon banaaya
 Manipur was the first state to do so
 8 november 2018 main manipur sarkaar ne ek notification jari kiya
 According to this law, lynching is defined in this law
 dharm, jati, ling, bhashaa, raajnneetik sambandhon ke aadhaar par achaanak yaa yojanabaddh tareeke se bheed kii koi bhi hinsa linching he
 In every district, the state government will appoint a police officer to look into such cases
 pehle se khufia jaankaree hasil karne ke liye special task force banaaya jayega
 Every police officer will take responsible steps to prevent lynchings
 jo bhi linching main doshi paaya jayega use saat saal tak kii sazaa hogi
 a fine of one lakh will have to be paid
 agar peedit gambhir rup se ghayal hota he to aise maamle main das saal kii sazaa hogi
 There will be a fine of 3 lakhs
 saazish main shaamil logon ko bhi isi tarah kii sazaa hogi
 It is not the first incident of lynching in Jharkhand
 vahaan kanoon kii sakht zarurat he
 The villagers have been killing them in the middle by calling women as witches
 firstpost website par is par ek report he
 This report is published on 13 March 2019
 isamen jharkhand police or rashtriya aparaadh shakha beuro ke aankadon kaa istamaal kiya gaya he
 According to this report, between 2001 and 2018, 590 women were killed as witches
 2016 se 2018 ke bich jharkhand kii rajdhani ranchi main 13 auraton ko dian bataa kar maar diya gaya
 The state government has also enacted a law called withcraft prevention act 2001
 is kanoon ke tahat kisi aurat ko dian bataane vaale ko 3 maah se ek saal kii sazaa he
 There is a fine of only Rs 2000
 hamane jharkhand police kii website par maujuud is kanoon kaa draft dekha to dian bataakar maarane waalon kii sazaa kaa zikr nahin mila
 It is just a punishment to tell the witch
 auraton kii jaan kitni sasti he
 This law has no effect
 iaiti patna or central uniwarsity jharkhand ke prophessoron ne is par ek research paper likhaa he
 Bani Bedi has extracted this research paper from the Research Gate website
 shamser alam or aditya raaj ne apane research main likhaa he ki dian bataakar maarane vaale zyaadaatar cese court tak hi nahin pahunch pate hai
 Even if you reach, witnesses are not found
 police kii jaanch thik se nahin hoti he
 The punishment is also very minor
 rashtriya aparaadh shakha beuro kaa data bhi puraa nahin he
 It only contains the number of women to be killed
 auraton ko garm lohe se daag dene, shaareerik angon ko kaat dene kaa zikr nahin hota
 Women are stripped naked and driven into the village
 research main alam or raaj ne likhaa he ki auraton kii sampatti ko hadapney ke liye unhen dian bataakar maar diya jaataa he
 Especially for women who do not have husbands
 yah main isliye bataa rahaa hum kyonki aap samaj saken ki bheed jab tabarez ko nahin maar rahi thi tab uski maansikta kisi aurat ko maar rahi hoti he
 This crowd has not come from anywhere, but now it happens among us
 aapako yaad hoga, pichley saal swaami agnivesh jharkhand gaye the

 ipel 2010 main sattebaaji or match phixing ke aaropon ke bich lalit modi landan chale gaye the
 He, however, denied doing anything wrong, saying that his life was threatened in India, which is why he had to come to Britain

 Meanwhile, former Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir Omar Abdullah said that, 'this unexpected order seems to have a real possibility of serious terrorist attack on Amarnath pilgrims and tourists, but this order does not relieve the atmosphere of fear prevailing in the valley at present

 Although this unprecedented order would seem to suggest a genuine fear of a massive terror strike directed at Amarnath ji yatris or / and tourists this will do nothing to dampen the sense of fear & foreboding that prevails in the valley at the moment

 raigarh ke ganga nursing home kaa bijli kaa bill jab achaanak kam aane laga to chhattisgarh vidyut vitaran company ke adhikariyon kaa maathaa thanka
 On December 23, 2010, a team of the vigilance department raided the nursing home and it was found that the jammer was installed near the electric meter and hence the meter was closed
 vibhaag ne nursing home par 1,96,000 kaa jurmaana to lagaaya hi police main shikaayat bhi darj karwaai
 Chhattisgarh - which will become a surplus state in terms of electricity once the Korba plant is started in the next six months, will be able to maintain its status as the first zero power cut state in the country, there is doubt because there is a lot of power theft in amazing ways Incidents are increasing day by day
 haal hi main jaimar ke jariye bijli chori ke pakade gaye aadha darjan maamalon ne to adhikariyon ke hosh uda daale hai
 The condition is that more than one-third of the electricity is stolen from the power distribution centers to consumers
 kuch sthanon par to 60 se 65 fisadi tak bijli chori ho jaati he
 If we calculate this total loss, then the figure is Rs 1,300 to 1,400 crore every year
 baithta he
 It faces an even bigger crisis in front of the power distribution company as a jammer
 kaaran, jaimar se bijli chori ko pakadana aasaan nahin he, yah baat vidyut satarkta vibhaag ke adhikari bhi maanate hai
 According to officials, this task will be challenging because every meter has to be monitored, which is practically not possible
 chori rokane ke liye hi vitaran company ne rajya ke 95 fisadi se zyada electro maikenical meter badal daale
 These could be opened and closed easily, so the department took the electronic meter route
 magar yah bhi kargar sabit nahin ho paaya
 The department has a number of cases in which power theft was caught through magnets and remote
 satarkta vibhaag ke mutabik saal bhar main akele durg jile main hi electronic meter main pratirohak lagaakar chori karne ke 314 maamle pakade gaye
 There are no less cases of power theft bypassing the meter in the state
 bypass yani meter ko jodne vaali taar se line khinchakar bijli chori, isse meter ghoomana band ho jaataa he
 In the last one year, the department has caught 186 cases of meter bypass in the state
 company ke adhikariyon ke mutabik rajya ke kuch ilaake to bijli choron ke liye kukhyat ho chuke hai, khaskar raigarh, mahasamund, kawardha or durg ilaaka
 Up to 50 percent of power theft takes place in Bemetara, Baloda area of durg
 haalat yah he ki vibhaag ne jab bijli vitaran kii frenchiji dene ke liye tender nikaala to kuch kendron ke liye to ek aavedan tak nahin aayaa
 Basna of Mahasamund district, Saraipali, Pandaria of Kawardha, Dabhra of Raigad district, Barmakavla, Sakti of Janjgir district are areas where vigilance department employees have to think a hundred times before leaving because officials in these areas have been caught stealing electricity But many times there have been attacks
 vaise automatic meter reeding system lagane se udyogon main choriyaan rukii hai
 For this, chips have been installed in the plants, so that the control room of the department gets information about the increase and decrease in consumption for 24 hours
 lekin vitaran company ke prabandh nideshak subodh singh kehete hai ki gharelu upabhoktaaon kii sankhya zyada hone kii vajah se automatic system lagaana sambhav nahin he
 Here the connivance of power thieves and officials is also causing trouble for the company
 is baat se vitaran company ke adhikari bhi inkaar nahin karte
 Apparently, power theft from remote is not possible without the cooperation of departmental people because to do this a chip is inserted inside the meter and only the people of the department can open the electronic meter
 koi or ise kholane kii koshish karegaa to sil tut jaaegi
 Additional Chief Vigilance Officer R
 bi
 Mishra says that power theft was caught at six places through jammers in Raigad district
 in sabhi jagah par jinas company ke meter lage the
 It is also in the information of the Vigilance Department that the person who has supplied the jammers in Raigad area previously worked in the genus company itself
 meter kharidi main bhi ghalmail kii shikaayatein aksar aati rahi hai
 However, the government is definitely looking serious on the issue of electricity theft
 mukhyamantri dow
 Raman Singh has appointed Subodh Singh, an IAS officer, as the Managing Director of the distribution company for the first time
 subodh kii chhavi eemaandaar adhikari kii he or unhone vitaran company kii kaman sambhalate hi bijli choron ke khilaaf jor-shor se abhiyaan ched diya he
 That is why 3,110 cases of power theft were caught in 2010-11 as compared to 1,478 cases in 2009-10
 subodh singh bataate hai ki saal bhar main line los 4 fisadi kam hua he or koshish ise ardash sthiti main laane kii he
 Due to their strictness, recently, 6,000 meters of the genus company in Bilaspur fell into the test
 2005-06 main bhi emko company ke 81,250 or jinas company ke 11,000 metron ko chumbakeey pareekshan main fawl ho jane par bijli board ne asweekaar kar diya tha
 But later they were passed by forming a technical expert committee
 bijli adhikariyon ne niyam viruddh jaakar jinas company ko 25 karod ru
 Has ordered an extension of
 ab lok ayog afasaron ke khilaaf is maamle kii jaanch kar rahi he
 By the way, most people believe that if electricity theft is controlled then the electricity rate can be cheaper
 rajya vidyut board ke purv sadsy, vitaran, sharadchand kaa kahana he ki chori par lagaam lagane par dar main nishchit rup se fark padegaa
 But if we believe an officer who has retired from a higher position from the electricity department, then it is not possible to rein in theft till there is political will
 sarkaar kii kamjor virgon ke liye shuru kii gai nishulk ekal batti conection yojana bhi baari pad rahi he
 Around 6 when the state was formed
 5 lakh ekal batti conection the jo badhkar 13
 5 lakhs
 ek balb kii paatrata vaale is conection kii aad main log tubalite se lekar pankhaa, televijan, cooler sabakuch chal rahe hai
 But even knowing this for all the officials, it is crooked because the vote bank politics starts
 gaanvon main bhi yahi haal he, raigarh jile main bijli chori rokane ke liye jab abhiyaan chhedaa gaya to janpratinidhiyon ne tatkaaleen adheekshan yantri subhash chanda ke karyaalay ke saamne dharna de diya, isamen sabhi partiyon ke netaa shaamil the

 en
 Singh says that the government will have to show strong will for it
 bijli chor bijli adhikariyon se ek kadam aage hi rahete hai
 As soon as the department finds a new way to stop the theft, the thieves find it every time
 chumbak se meter band na ho iske liye bijli vibhaag ne companiyon ko aisa meter banane ko kaha jo chumbak ko paas le jate hi tej ghoomane lage
 But there was a problem in it that if the small magnet also went near the meter by deception, it started moving fast
 iske baad farmaan hua ki 100 mili taxla kshamta tak ke chumbak se meter tej na chale, to bijli chor spark gan kii madad se meter band karne lage
 The spark gun means the current coming out of the spark of a two-wheeler plug, similarly the meter of the spark gun stops running
 lekin isse sirf 35 kavvie kshamta kaa meter band hota tha isliye vibhaag ne isse adhik kshamta kaa meter banvaanaa shuru kar diya
 Power thieves brought the remote and the jammer to its cut
 sharadchand do took kehete hai, ''bijli chori rokane main na police kii madad or na rajnatik protsaahan miltaa he
 Even in the police quarters, electricity goes on without a meter, due to vote bank, the leaders do not want the thieves to take action
 '' ve kehete hai ki nangi taron kii jagah arial banj kavbal lagaana chahie taaki king (taar daalkar bijli kheenchna) na ho
 Look at the power loss in the state, the electricity board received 17,601 million units of power from various plants in 2010-11, out of which only 12,098 million units were spent and the remaining 5,503 million units went into power transmission and distribution losses
 bijli haani kaa standard los 15 fisadi he lekin rajya main 18 pratishat adhik nuksaan ho rahaa he
 Ironically, after the formation of the state, the emphasis was on production, but the Electricity Board was never serious about stopping the loss
 yahi vajah he ki bijli board banane ke samay 2002-03 main haani 33
 76 per cent, it increased to 34 in 2009-10
 27 fisadi ho gai
 However, the power distribution company has also taken up the task to prevent theft
 subodh singh bataate hai ki transfarmar main meter lagaae jaaenge, isse pataa lagaana aasaan rahegaa ki kis ilaake main adhik chori ho rahi he
 Underground wires will be laid in areas where electricity is stolen from hooking
 iske alaava kuch shaharon main spot billing bhi shuru kar di gai he
 This will also prevent theft
 bijli chori kii shikaayat karne par inaam kaa bhi praavdhaan kiya gaya he
 Modern tools of theft: Jammer: The latest technique of theft is jammer
 yah ek aisa upkaran he jise meter ke paas on karke laga diya jaataa he, iske lagate hi meter ko frequency milanaa band ho jaati he or meter ghoomana band ho jaataa he
 It can be easily removed during meter testing so it is unlikely to be caught
 jaimar ke hataane par meter pehle kii tarah chalane lagata he
 In the market it is Rs 4,000 to Rs 15,000
 main khaas dukaanon main uplabdh he
 Powerful magnet: Placing the magnet under the meter stops the meter
 iske liye bazaar main bade aakaar ke chumbak uplabdh hai or inaki keemat 6,000 se 8,000 ru
 is
 electronic meter lag jane se chumbak kaa istemaal kam ho gaya he
 Spark Gun: The spark gun, the spark of a two-wheeler plug, produces the same current as the spark spark gun, which stops the meter from running
 spark gan se 35 kevie kshamta kaa meter band ho jaataa he, keemat he 3,000-4,000 ru
 Remote: a chip is inserted inside the meter
 electronic meter main yah vibhaag ke logon kii mileebhagat ke bina sambhav nahin
 The advantage of this is that whenever you want, turn off the meter from the remote and when the electricity department employees come to read the meter, turn on the meter from the remote

 This stops the meter from moving

 Then their foreheads were stolen and caught in Case 1: The electricity billing in the Ganga Nursing Home of Raigad started decreasing, then the officials of Chhattisgarh Electricity Distribution Company got a foul smell
 chori pakadaney ke liye satarkta vibhaag ke dal ne nursing home par chapa maaraa
 Then it was discovered that the meter had a jammer on it and this was why the meter was closed
 vibhaag ne nursing home par 1,96,000 kaa jurmaana thoka, saath hi saath police main bhi shikaayat darj karwaai
 Case 2: In Raigad itself, the electricity bill of Color Plus Lab, which took photographs, suddenly reduced, the department formed a team of officials of the vigilance department to investigate

 While discussing with some journalists, Gaur admitted that the party's president and national organization General Secretary Ramlal has instructed him to write Yadav in front of his name
 unhone sanghathan ke nirdesh par tay bhi kar liya he ki ab ve tathaa unki putravadhu jo nagar nigam bhopal kii mahayor he,apane naam ke saath yadav likhenge
 Gaur has further said that they are Yadavs but people do not know their caste, so now they will add Yadav in their names

 The Congress has attacked when the BJP organization directed Gaur to write Yadav with his name

 'da kapil sharma sho' main dabl fees ke saath vaapasi kii khabaron ke bich sunil grover kaa ek nayaa bayaan aayaa he
 And it is also a confuser
 twitor par sunil ne likhaa he ki vah sirf paison ke liye kaam nahin karte or unhen izzat bahut pyaari he
 Now with this new tweet, Sunil has again put his fans in a dilemma as to whether he will return on Kapil Sharma's show
 sunil se jhagade ke baad kaaphi badal gaye hai kapil sharma!dekhen twit-my intentions are to act and to entertain with dignity
 For me, money can't be the only reason to do something, or not to do something
 üôè‚Äî Sunil Grover (@whosunilgrover)april 5, 2017to kya dabl fees par bhi nahin maane sunilabata den ki aaj subah hi khabar thi ki sunil grover 7 april se kapil sharma ke sho kii shooting shuru karenge
 Not only this, it is also being said that for this the channel has doubled the fees according to their demand
 lekin sunil kaa nayaa bayaan kanphyus kar rahaa he
 So is he not ready to return even if he gets double the amount! Sunil Grover can return to Kapil Sharma's show, shooting will be from April 7! There is still a huge amount of contract but Sunil's high hopes of returning to the show are due to him on April 23 To be tied up to the contract
 agar yah puraa nahin hua to sunil ko iske badale main motaa harjaana dena pad saktaa he
 According to some reports, Sunil Grover was to resume shooting for the show from 7 April
 iske baad 8, 11 or 12 april ke shedul main bhi unke maujuud rahane kii khabar thi
 Raju Srivastava confirmed on Kapil's show, Johnny Lever's daughter's entry too
 If Sunil Grover remains firm on his decision if he does not return to 'the Kapil Sharma Show', the channel will take a tough step on the falling TRP and the growing controversy of the show

 In Chhattisgarh, due to lack of timely paddy cultivation, food grains worth Rs
 1 billion 73 crores were damaged
 ye dhan ab kodiyon ke daam par sharaab thekedaaron ko bechaa jayega, taaki wo iskaa istemaal sharaab banane main kar saken
 The government has suffered this loss of crores due to negligence of government officials
 rajya main centre sarkaar kii madad se salanaa das hajaar karod kii dhan kii kharidi hoti he
 Rice of this paddy is taken out and kept in government warehouses
 jiske baad chaaval ko peedies ke jariye aam logon tak pahunchataa he
 Recently, news of hundreds of tons of lentils roting in the government ration shops of Chhattisgarh had also made headlines
 ann dhan kii yah barbaadi tab ho rahi he, jab aaj bhi desh ke ek varg ko bharpayt bhojan naseeb nahin hota
 The dal-bhat scheme operated for this also came to a halt because the state government's BJP government could not provide them cheap ration
 naa jimmedaari, naa karrwaigambhir baat yah bhi he ki khadyann kii barbaadi rokane ke liye naa to koi upaay kiye jate or naa hi jimmedaar afasaron ke khilaaf koi kanoonee karrwai hi hoti he
 This situation is when Chhattisgarh is famous as the rice bowl in the country
 rajya ke ek bade hisse main dhan kii banpar paidaavaar hoti he
 In order to enable farmers to get the support price of paddy, more and more of their crops should be purchased, for this, all political parties, from the farmers, talk a lot about the struggle
 lekin sarkari tijori se kharidi jane vaali dhan kaa kya haal hota he, ye saamne he
 If you want to take stock of the thousands of tons of paddy that is rotting under the open sky, then turn to the paddy producing districts of the state
 raipur se mahasamund, bemetara or dhamtari, baalod or durg
 Raipur to Bilaspur, Balodabazar, Bhatapara, Mungeli or Champa Janjgir
 in jilon kii ore jane vaali sadakon ke donon ore khule aasmaan ke neeche aaj bhi hajaaron ton dhan aapako laavaaris halaat main dikhegaa
 Most of these paddy has been kept carelessly
 uske cap cover fat chuke hai, vahiin kai jagah to cap cover lagaae hi nahin gaye
 As a result, the paddy rotated soaked in rain
 baabuon ko notice dekar itishreeinamen se kai boriyon main illiyaan lag gayi to kai hisse main dhan kii baaliyaan bhi ug ai hai
 This paddy was purchased with the earning of the sweat and blood of the public, but carelessly seeing such a pile of paddy leaves your eye torn
 is laaparvaahee ke liye koi bhi jimmedaar adhikari saamne nahin aayaa
 Neither a strong investigation nor action against anyone was recommended
 haa, sadi hui dhan kaa byoraa nilaamee kar thikaane lagane ke liye khaadya mantri ke paas aayaa to do-chaar baabuon or teen munshiyon ke khilaaf karrwai kaa notice bhej diya gaya
 It was written in the notice that why should not the amount of paddy destroyed by his salary be recovered
 khaadya mantri ne dhan ke sadane se kiya inkaarrajyake khaadya mantri punnuulaal mohale is puure maamle main apana tark dete hai
 At first they continued to deny the destruction of paddy, but when it came to reality, they started referring to the action
 mohale kehete hai, 'dhan sadane kaa prashn hi nahin uthta
 There is a cap cover and the paddy of 12-13 has been graded
 tender ho rahaa he
 The tender will be auctioned
 jo dhan bina cap cover ke hai, uske liye karrwai ho rahi he
 Many have been given notice
 kai logon terminete kiya gaya he
 The liquor businessman was the sole buyer, however, when the minister's claims were investigated, it was found that there are collection centers in the state where the Munshi and Babus had pledged millions of paddy
 unke khilaaf police main shikaayat hui
 Action has been taken against five babus and three society managers in such separate cases
 naa kii dhan kii barbaadi ko lekar
 Paddy is of no use after rotting
 ise naa to jaanavar khate he or naa hi koi upyog ho saktaa he
 Except it is used to make wine after rotting
 lihaaja, arabon kaa dhan chand sharaab vyapaariyon ko nilaamee main de di jaati he
 The state government has set up paddy collection centers in every village to easily procure paddy from the farmers engaged in saving the seniors
 kisaan in sangrahan kendron main apni dhan bechata he
 The responsibility of storage and off-take of this paddy is with the consortium of the state
 yah sarkari sanstha dhan ke parivahan main mahatvapurn role adaa karti he
 In order to allow the paddy to be lifted in time, officials from the Food Department to the officials of the consortium take responsibility
 lekin bade paimaane par dhan kii barbaadi saamne aane par har ek afasar apane varisht afasaron ko bachaane main juta he
 The 'CBI investigation should be on the matter' The fact is that no one has been held responsible for the ruined paddy
 dhan ke khel ke bhanda footne ke bhay se puraa mahakama lipapoti main juta he
 State chief RTI activist Virendra Pandey says, "no mechanization of the state government can investigate the issue, because many big government officials are involved in the scam
 isliye is maamle kii sibiai jaanch honi chahie
 'pandey says that paddy is rotten in a planned manner so that this paddy is sold in the open market on a large scale
 maang or purti ke antar ko niojit karne ke liye sade hue dhan kaa byoraa register main darj kar diya jaataa he
 In this way a big scam is executed
 peedies system par pehle hi uth chuke hai sawalchhattisgarh kaa peedies system pehle hi desh main surkhiyaan bator chukaa he
 Whereas the 'civil Supplies Corporation', a unit called pdb's backbone, was scammed by billions
 nigam main padasth iees adhikari iske emdi anil tuteja or pramukh sachiv khaadya alok shukla ko anti karpshan beuro ne chargeshit kiya
 But he has neither been arrested nor suspended yet
 supreme court ne bhi rajya sarkaron ko anaaj kii barbaadi rokane ko lekar hidaayat di he, lekin iskaa koi asar chhattisgarh main dikhaai nahin detaa

 Shivraj asked why did it come to take U-turn? President Rahul Gandhi has supported the government on the Kashmir issue
 unhone twit ke jariye kaha he ki kashmir bharat kaa aantarik masalaa he or pakistan yaa phir kisi anya desh ko is maamle main hastkshep karne nahin diya jayega
 On this statement of Rahul Gandhi, former Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh Shivraj Singh Chauhan has spoken a verbal attack
 bhopal main patrakaron se baat karte hue shivaraj singh chouhan ne rahul gandhi se sawaal poocha he ki ab you-turn kyon liya? shivaraj ne kaha, "rahul ji ke is tarah ke kadam desh virodh jaise hai
 It gives Pakistan a chance to quote them and put their point before the world
 rahul ji ye khel band kariye
 Why did you come to take a U-turn? ‚Äùshivraj further said that Rahul Gandhi has been speaking what Pakistan used to say
 kashmir main anuchhed 370 hataane par desh khush he, lekin rahul gandhi khush nahin hai
 Why did Rahul Gandhi go to Srinagar? Let this be the first time that Shivraj Singh Chauhan has attacked Rahul Gandhi
 isse pehle goa main ek kaarykram ke dauraan bhi shivaraj singh chouhan ne anuchhed 370 par rahul gandhi or sonia gandhi ko gheraa tha
 He had said, "I don't think Rahul Gandhi will say anything on the issue of Article 370 because he has become Ranchodas Gandhi
 congress abhi bhi bhram main he
 Their leaders are making different statements on this issue
 main nahin samaj paa rahaa hum ki congress koi party he! kuch netaa artical 370 hataane kaa samarthan kar rahe hai to kuch pakistan kii bhashaa bol rahe hai
 " punjab main aam aadmi party ke purv sanyojaksuccha singhchhotepur ne dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwaj or up-mukhyamantri manish sisodiya or duusare netaaon ko nishaanaa banaae jane ke baad, aap ke netaa himmat singh ne chhotepur par palatwaar kiya he
 AAP leader and the party's legal cell chief Himmat Singh Shergill denied Chhotepur's allegations that, if he was angry with Arvind Kejriwal over Sikhism, why has he remained silent till date
 shergill kaa chhotepur par kiya palatwararavivaar kochandigarhmen hui ek press conference ke dauraan himmat singh shergill ne kaha ki, 26 agast ko media ke saamne succha singh chhotepur ne arvind kejariwal par yah aarope isliye lagaae hai
 Because Sucha Singh Singh Chhotepur is surrounded by allegations of taking two lakh rupees as a bribe as a bribe, and he has also agreed to take this two lakh in front of the party and the media
 kyonki paise lete hue ek sting saboot ke taur par saamne aa gaya tha
 Therefore Chhotepur has falsely accused Arvind Kejriwal
 shergill ne kaha ki 26 agast ko chhotepur ne apane aarope main amritsar ke jis baat kaa zikr kiya he, vah 18 agast kii he
 Now the question arises that if Arvind Kejriwal has made such allegations on Chhotepur, then as a Sikh he should have protested before Arvind Kejriwal
 press conference kar is baat ko saarvajanik karnaa chahie tha
 But why did they not? Chotepur confessed to taking bribe of two lakh rupees: Himmat Singh Himmat Singh Shergill said that the Aam Aadmi Party has a simple and clear policy for taking funds in the form of donations and one each as party funds Money is accounted for
 chhotepur ye bhi jhooth bolaa he ki party kaa koi khajaanachi nahin he
 The party has all 13 zones and one main state-level bank account across Punjab
 chhotepur ne dilli ke up-mukhyamantri munish sisodiya or media ke saamne kabool kiya he ki unhone us samay do lakh rupye kii koi raseed nahin di
 On the basis of his confession, the party's PAC removed Chhotepur from the post of conveyor and submitted the entire matter to the two-member committee
 shergill ne yah bhi saaf kiya party kii reliyaan or jan-sabhaayen bataur canavinar chhotepur yaa kisi netaa dwaara die gaye fund se nahin hoti, uskaa prabandh party or sthaneey str ke aayojakon ke jariye jutaye gaye fund se hoti he, jiskaa puraa hisaab rakhaa hota he
 Himmat Singh has defended Bhagwant Mann
 He said that until the allegation is proved on the basis of Mann's blood test
 tab tak un par sharaab kii lat ke aarope lagaana sahi nahin he
 While Bhagwant Mann has challenged all opposing leaders including Sukhbir Badal and Captain Amarinder Singh that everyone should have a dope test
 andhra pradesh ne khud ko khule main shouch mukt (ODF) rajya bataaya he, jabaki jamini hakeekat kuch or hi he
 The South State has gone one step ahead and declared itself ODF Plus

 In June last year, the then Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu declared the state to be the ODF
 unhone daawa kiya tha ki rajya ne 2
 It has exceeded the target of the state by constructing 77 lakh private toilets
 bataa den ki varsh 2016 main mahatma gandhi jayanti ke maukey par rajya ke sabhi 110 shahari sthaneey nikaay ne daawa kiya tha ki unhone svachh andhra karporation (SAC) ke madhyam se ODF ke lakshya ko praapt kar liya he
 SAC was established by the state government in 2015 to achieve the goals of the Swachh Bharat Mission

 unke rakrakhaav kaa kya? koi bhi shahar main jaakar dekh saktaa he, log abhi bhi shauchalayon ke sthaan par unke paas hi khule main peshaab kar rahe hai or iskaa kaaran he banaae gaye shauchalayon ke rakrakhaav main kami

 satyanarayan ne daawa kiya ki vibhinn vibhaagon main kisi prakaar kaa koi talmail nahin he
 They are designed without harmony
 is vajah se adhik shauchalay prayog main laane laayak nahin hai
 He asked, 'they did not even ensure proper drainage
 kai saarvajanik shauchalayon main yaa to pani kaa tehraav he yaa ve badboo maar rahe hai
 The government's responsibility does not end with just building toilets
 unke rakrakhaav kaa kya hua?' Jammu and Kashmir Deputy Chief Minister Nirmal Singh has dismissed the allegation of his Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti that the Central Government is responsible for the situation in Kashmir
 singh ne 'aaj tak' se khaas baatcheet main kaha ki centre or rajya sarkaar aapasi madad se hi pradesh aage bad rahaa he
 Deputy CM Nirmal Singh in PDP-BJP government said, 'mehbooba Muftika this allegation is not true
 centre to bahut madad kar rahaa he jammu-kashmir kii
 We are moving ahead with the help of the center
 jammu-kashmir ke jo halaat hai, uske liye puri tareeke se pakistan jimmedaar he
 'what did Mehbooba say that on the occasion of Independence Day, CM Mehbooba Mufti blamed the central government from Jawaharlal Nehru to Narendra Modi for the situation in Kashmir
 siem ne kaha tha, 'jammu-kashmir ke maujuuda halaat ke liye jawahar laal nehru se lekar vartmaan tak kaa kendriya netritv jimmedaar he
 Whether guns are from terrorists or ours, there will be no problem with guns
 'padhein, baatcheet ke pramukh ansh-sawaal- jammu-kashmir ke jo halaat hai, uske liye koun jimmedaar he or halaat kab thik honge?nirmal singh-pakistan lagaataar jab se jammu-kashmir kaa bharat ke saath vilay hua he
 Has been doing mischief ever since and tries to create such situations there that there is no stability
 aatankwaad ko usne badhaava diya he
 He is responsible for the situation there since 1947
 local level par unke kuch log hai, jo unako sahyog karte hai
 Jammu and Kashmir is an integral part of India, it interferes with it
 sawaal- mahabuuba mufti kah rahi hai ki jammu-kashmir ke halaat ke liye centre jimmedaar he
 Due to the policy of the Central Government, these circumstances have been created
 us vajah se problem ho rahi he?nirmal singh-dekhie aisa to kuch mere saamne he nahin
 there's nothing like this
 assembly main bhi or baahar bhi
 No such thing has come
 lekin centre ke sahyog se jammu-kashmir sarkaar ke sahyog se hi chijen aage bad sakati hai
 For this, there has always been cooperation from the center
 jammu-kashmir main keval andar kaa maamla nahin he
 External intervention which is a direct intervention from Pakistan
 uske liye vahi jimmedaar he
 Question- India's policy has been somewhat aggressive about Pakistan
 chaahe vah pioke kaa mudda ho yaa pradhanmantri narendra modi ne baluchistan kaa mudda uthaaya
 Why this change all of a sudden? Nirmal Singh - Always talked about negotiating with Pakistan
 karte bhi hai, lekin bich-bich main vah sharaarat bhi karte hai
 Send the militants inside
 yahaan par maasoom logon ko maaraa jaataa he
 The Prime Minister has directly given a statement on the situation here
 agar vah queshchan mark lagaate hai
 For the merger of Jammu and Kashmir, when the partition was taking place, even in the North West region, when at the time of partition, they had expressed their wish that we want to go with India
 lekin kyonki bharat ke saath uski territary kaa jo milaap nahin tha
 Due to this also he went to Pakistan
 dil se vah kabhi bhi vahaan nahin janaa chaahate the
 But the way Pakistan is committing atrocities in Balochistan
 gilgit blatistan main kar rahaa he
 Which is doing in POK
 pradhanmantriji ne jo stand liya he, vah puure desh kaa stand he
 Because Pakistan is not ready to accept anything legitimate
 sawaal- kaha ja rahaa he ki kashmir par nahin, pioke par baat hogi
 Dr
 Jitendra Singh has said that pok will be liberated soon
 vahaan jhanda fahraayenge
 When will it get liberated and when will it hoist the flag? Nirmal singh-pok is illegally captured by Pakistan
 pakke taur par aane vaale samay main jab bhi baatcheet hoti he to us par baatcheet hogi
 He is an integral part of India
 bharat kaa hissaa he or vahaan par jo log hai, unase jabardastee kii ja rahi he
 He is absolutely a part of us and will strive for it in the same way
 yah to diplomasi he
 It is a matter of time to come
 pakke taur par wo hamaara hissaa he or hissaa banegaa
 If the part is formed then the flag will be hoisted in due course
 sawaal- aapako lagata he ki baluchistan ke mudde se ek nai bahes chhid gai he, nae sire se or pakistan ko isolet karne kii koshish kii ja rahi he?nirmal singh-pakistan kashmir ko lekar hameshaa se tarah tarah kii baaten karata he
 Human rights are being violated
 are aap apana ghar dekho naa
 What is happening in Sindh in your home? What is happening in Baluchistan? What is happening in the west? Isn't even Ibn Punjab cool? The extremism of which you created the monster
 vah unheen ko khaane ja rahaa he
 The manner in which they try to create a situation against India in Jammu and Kashmir
 usee dhang se pakistan ke khilaaf bhi deal karne ke liye yah aaj kii date main ek sahi rasta he
 Question- Your statement came about Burhan Wani
 lekin mahabuuba mufti kaa bayaan aayaa ki agar vahaan par burhan kii maujuudagi kaa pataa hota to yah halaat nahin banate or encounter nahin karnaa padataa?nirmal singh-burhan vaani ek aatanki tha or tebrist ko usee dhang se deal kiya jaataa he, jis dhang se usko deal kiya gaya

 Let us tell you that SSC CHSL level exam was conducted in the month of November and December
 paper main objective tip ke sawaal puche gaye the
 Breakup can break anyone
 jab kisi se pyaar ho or wo dur chalaa jaae to aise main khud ko sanbhaalanaa bahut mushkil ho jaataa he
 By the way, this problem of today's youth has been raised well in the recently released film 'dear Zindagi' and the ways to deal with it are told as easily and beautifully
 isamen kaayra (alia bhatta) jise pasand karti he, vah kisi or se sagaai kar letaa he
 During this time, Dr
 helps to deal with the situation
 jahangir khan (shahrukh khan)
 Now in 'dear Zindagi', what knowledge does Kayra get to get out of the misery of backups, in these 5 points you also know -1
 ghutane kii bajaay baat karendukh se baahar nikalne ke liye kisi se baatcheet karnaa jaruri he
 Share your experiences with anyone
 isamen aapaki family yaa dost madad kar sakate hai
 If there is no such thing, then seek the help of a counselor
 kaayra ke dost is mushkil samay main uske saath or jahaan use laga ki sichuation sanbhaalane main use dikkat ho rahi he, vahiin usne dow
 Jahangir started taking help from Khan
 bole chaahe na bole par zyaadaatar ladakiyon ke man main chalati hai ye 10 baaten2
 Parents are always useful
 Being broke up does not end life
 isliye khud ko maayusi main dhakelne kii bajaay aise log ke bich rahane kii koshish karen, jo aapse pyaar karte hai
 Parents may or may not understand you, but they will love you without any condition or reason
 aise main apane maa-baap se baat karnaa or unke saath samay bitaana aapako suraksha kaa ehsaas degaa
 Is your partner like it too? 3
 ekadam kamitment na karenkyra ko therapy lete samay rumi miltaa he jo pehali najar main us par fida ho jaataa he
 Kayra also likes her
 lekin jahaan use lagata he ki vah uske saath nahin nibhaa sakegi, vah peeche hat jaati he
 If you too have a breakup, then it is better that you wait a little rather than get tied up in a relationship
 jaane, kam pani pinaa ho saktaa he kitna khatarnaak!4
 Overcome your fear, if someone has left you in the middle of the road, then instead of blaming him, see also where you were lacking
 jis tarah kaayra kamitment se dar rahi thi, ho saktaa he ki aapaki hi koi aadat use aapse dur le gai ho
 It would be better to think about your shortcomings and fears after a breakup, rather than thinking of suicide or frivolity
 phir inako dur karke jindagi main aage kadam badhayen
 If you want to avoid cancer, change your lifestyle

 Therefore, take the thought of thinking of yourself as bad and go on assuming that the special one is made for you, you will definitely get it

 abhinayta om puri kii maut par paak media main betuki khabaron kaa prasaaran jari he
 Earlier, PM Modi and NSA Ajit Doval were blamed in the Pakistani media for calling Om Puri's death a conspiracy, and now the murder of Salman Khan and Fawad Khan is also being feared after the death of Ompuri there
 bhartiya janata party kii pravaktaa sina ensi ne in tarah kii khabaron ko apmanjanak bataaya or om puri kii maut ke peeche koi political sajeesh hone kii baat ko saaf nakaar diya he
 Pak anchor's accusation: modi-doval's hand behind Om Puri's death, Bharatiya Janata Party spokesperson Saina N
 si ne kaha ki pakistani media ko khabaren dene se pehle kaaphi research karne kii jarurat he
 First of all, this Kiom Puri was the defender of our country
 unki maut se pakistan ko koi matlab nahin hona chahie
 Secondly, if it makes a difference to them, then it is necessary to check their facts before making any allegations
 kya vaaki natural thi om puri kii deth? in vajahon se uth rahe hai sawalbhartiya janata party kii pravaktaa ne aage kaha ki yahaan bharat main ham saaf or nishpaksh media main vishwaas rakhte hai
 After the death of Om Puri, the anchor of a TV channel in Pakistan has claimed that Narendra Modi and Ajit Doval are behind the death of Bollywood actor Om Puriki
 us ankar ke is bayaan kaa soshal media main jamkar majaak bhi bana tha
 What Om Puri did a day before the death, told that after a friend reported that there are reports in the Pakistani media recently that Salman Khan and Fawad Khan may be murdered after Ompuri's death
 ye aarope modi sarkaar par lagaae ja rahe hai

 congress kii dhuree ke bina vipaksh kii ekta sambhav nahin hone kaa daawa karte hue congress ke ek varisht netaa ne kaha he ki uttar pradesh upachunaav main bhaajapa kii uske majboot wicket par haar se saaf ho gaya he ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ko bhi haraaya ja saktaa he
 Senior Congress leader and former Maharashtra Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan told 'bhasha' when asked about the possibility of a third front emerging in current Indian politics, "without Congress there cannot be an opposition
" congress jahaan ek aadhaar he vahiin doosraa aadhaar bhaajapa he
 Now it is not possible that the Congress should be removed and made the opposition
 ‚Äô‚Äô He admitted that it would be a matter of view that how many opposition parties the Congress is able to bring with them
 chavaan ne haal main sampann mahadhiveshan main samprag adhyaksh sonia gandhi kii ek tippanee kaa hawala dete hue kaha ki iskaa saaf sandesh tha ki jo kaam shimla sammelan ke baad ho saktaa he, vah 2019 main bhi ho saktaa he
 At the plenary, Sonia had pointed out that the party decided not to form alliances with other parties in Pachmarhi, while at the Shimla conference, the Congress agreed to form an alliance
 sansad main tedepa or wiesar congress dwaara sarkaar ke khilaaf avishvaas prastaav laane or vipaksh kii ekajutata ko lekar congress dwaara abhi tak agrani bhoomika nibhaate dikhaayi nahin dene ke bare main puche jane par chavaan ne kaha, ‚Äò‚Äòabhi aisa lag saktaa he
 '' unhone kaha ki congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ko abhi apni team banani he
 Over time all this will happen, there will be working committee, there will be core team, there will be inner team
 pehle se yah sab tha par rahul ke adhyaksh banane ke baad yah asthaayee ho gaya jise unhen sthayitv dena hoga
 There will be general secretaries for every state and they will talk to the parties there for an alliance
 shivasena or tedepa sahit rajg ke kuch ghatak dalon ke apni sarkaar ke ravaiye ke khilaaf haal main aaye bayanon ke bare main poochne par maharashtra ke purv mukhyamantri ne kaha, ‚Äò‚Äòdekhie, uttar pradesh upachunaav ke baad sab hill gayi hai
 It has been a clear message that Modi can be defeated in his own constituency
 dekhne vaali baat he ki modi ke liye gorakhpur or phulpur se zyada koi majboot wicket nahin ho saktaa
 Seats vacated by the current Chief Minister and Deputy Chief Minister
 
 
 isse zyada majboot wicket kya ho saktaa he? usko yadi majbootee se haraa diya gaya to iskaa matlab he ki modi ko bhi haraaya ja saktaa he
 Mathematics was already stating that they have only 31 percent votes
 ab yah baat sabit bhi ho gayi (upachunaav ke nateezon se)
 Now the question is, how will Modi keep his alliance united and what will prevent us from forming an alliance? '' upra chunaavon ko lekar yah atakalein lagaayi ja rahi hai ki bhaajapa ne jaanboojh kar dhang se chunaav nahin ladaa taaki iviem vivaad par viraam lag sake
 Asked about this, Chavan said, "I don't believe it
 log to yah bhi kehete hai ki yogi apane ko bhavi pradhanmantri kii tarah pesh karne lage the, isliye unhen yah sabak sikhaaya gaya
 
 
 But this is all wrong
 ‚Äô‚Äô Asked about the Congress not joining the SP-BSP winning coalition in Uttar Pradesh, Chavan said that these two parties will come together, could this have ever been imagined
 kintu donon saath aaye or yah ek jeet kaa formula ban gaya
 Each state has its own formula for victory
 hamaare rajya maharashtra main congress or rakanpa kaa saath aana jeetne kaa formula he
 In response to a question, he said that the Congress is the only party in the opposition that has a presence in the entire country, even though it may be less
 chavaan ne mana ki jis kisi rajya main teesri shakti majboot he vahaan congress haashiye par chali gayi he jaise tamilnadu, uttar pradesh, bihar yaa pashchim bengal
 But if you look at the whole country together, we are the biggest opposition party
 aap abhi aisi sthiti kii kalpana nahin kar sakate ki congress kii anedkhi kii ja sakati he yaa congress apraasangik ho gayi he
 Asked if there could be an 'invisible hand' behind trs's efforts for unity of opposition, he said, "I don't know, but it can happen
" kesiar kii kya bhoomika he, koi nahin bataa saktaa
 "if they weaken the Congress, then only BJP will benefit from it
" karnataka chunaav ke bare main unhone kaha ki party ne siddharmaiya ko spasht taur par apana mukhyamantri pratyaashee ghoshit kiya he
 Under his leadership, he will contest elections in the state and Rahul Gandhi will also play his role
 ek sawaal ke jawaab main unhone mana ki yadi rajya vidhansabha chunaav main khandit janadesh aayaa to us halaat main jades mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaayegaa
 "I am deeply concerned that if a clear verdict is not forthcoming, these people (BJP) are very adept at manipulations to be done after the elections
" ‚Äô‚Äô Asked about whether JDS can join hands with BJP in Karnataka, he said, "dev Gowda is very against it
 kintu kumaraswami kaa pataa nahin
 '' yah puche jane par ki rahul gandhi ne udayman (risergent) congress banane kii baat he, usamen chavaan kii kya bhoomika hogi or kya vah kendriya str par jimmedaari sanbhaalane ko taiyaar hai, unhone kaha ki yah faisla puri tarah se netritv kaa hoga
 Now it was a matter of Rajya Sabha seat which was given to Kumar Ketkar
 
 
 main abhi rajya ke muddon main kaaphi vyast hum
 Asked about the relationship between BJP and Shiv Sena, Chavan said that as a political analyst, he believes that the BJP will never let Shiv Sena separate from itself
 yadi loksabhaa chunaav main hindutv vaale vot bant gayi to uske liye pareshaani khadi ho jaaegi
 BJP will suffer a lot of damage
 abhi un donon ke paas kul 48 siton main se 42 siten hai
 "they cannot do this in the Lok Sabha elections
" vah kisi tarah haath pair jodakar, file dikhaakar, dabaav daalkar, jail kaa dar dikhaakar yani sam, daam, dand bhed se vah unhen alag nahin hone denge
 '' chavaan ne yah bhi ashanka jataayi ki congress or rakanpa kaa gathbandhan todane ke liye kisi bhi tarah kii chaal chal sakati he
 He also ruled out the possibility of Shiv Sena joining the Congress and NCP
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki yadi bhaajapa or shivasena alag alag lade to hamen kaaphi phayda ho saktaa he
 Chavan said that apart from these two alliances in Maharashtra, Dalit parties can also have an important position
 bahut bant chuke hai
 On one side is Prakash Ambedkar
 duusari taraf ramdaas athavle hai, jo bhaajapa ke saath hai
 There has been a lot of tension after the bhima-koregaon incident
 isliye iske kai aayam hai
 Dalit politics has a big role in Maharashtra
 tippaniyan Regarding the alliance with Sharad Pawar-led NCP, Chavan said that senior leaders of both the parties are of the view that an alliance between them is inevitable
 abhi communiston dwaara kisaanon kaa jo march nikaala gaya, use sabhi vipakshi dalon ne samarthan diya
 Therefore, parties with similar views can be compromised
 seat bantwaare ke bare main sahmati ban sakati he
 He ruled out the possibility of taking the Shiv Sena with him in such an alliance, saying that unless Shivesana is a test of secularism then it cannot be supported
 unhone mana ki dekhne vaali baat hogi ki congress apane saath kitne vipakshi dalon ko laa paati he
 Chavan, citing a comment by UPA Chairperson Sonia Gandhi at the recently concluded plenary, said that it had a clear message that the work that could be done after the Shimla conference could also be done in 2019
 mahadhiveshan main sonia ne dhyaan dilaayaa tha ki party ne pachmadi main anya dalon ke saath gathbandhan nahin karne kaa faisla kiya jabaki shimla sammelan main congress ne gathbandhan karne par sahmati jataayi thi
 Asked by the TDP and YSR Congress in Parliament to bring a no-confidence motion against the government and that the Congress has not yet been shown to play a leading role in the opposition's solidarity, Chavan said, "it may seem like right now
" ‚Äô‚Äô He said that Congress President Rahul Gandhi has yet to make his team
 samay ke saath yah sab bhi hoga, kaarysmiti hogi, kor team hogi, bhitari team hogi
 It was already there, but it became temporary after Rahul became the president, which would give him stability
 har rajya ke liye mahasachiv banenge or ve gathbandhan ke liye vahaan ke dalon se baatcheet karenge
 Asked about the recent statements of some NDA constituents, including Shiv Sena and TDP, against the attitude of their government, the former Maharashtra chief minister said, "see, all are shaken up after the Uttar Pradesh by-election
" yah spasht sandesh gaya he ki modi ko unke hi kshetra main haraaya ja saktaa he
 It remains to be seen that for Modi there can be no stronger wicket than Gorakhpur and Phulpur
 vartmaan mukhyamantri evam up mukhyamantri dwaara khaali kii gayi siten
 
 
 What could be a stronger wicket? If he is defeated strongly, it means that Modi can also be defeated
 ganit to pehle hi bataa rahaa tha ki unke paas keval 31 pratishat vot hai
 Now this has also been proved (with the by-election results)
 ab sawaal yahi he ki modi apane gathbandhan ko kaise ekajute rakh paayenge or hamen gathbandhan banane se kya roak paaenge?‚Äô‚Äô There has been speculation about the UP elections that the BJP did not deliberately contest elections so that the EVM dispute could be brought to an end
 is bare main poochne par chavaan ne kaha, ‚Äò‚Äòmain ise nahin maanata
 People also say that Yogis were beginning to present themselves as future prime ministers, so they were taught this lesson
 
 
 par yah sab galat baat he
 '' uttar pradesh main sapa-basapa ke jeet vaale gathbandhan main congress kaa saath nahin hone ke bare main poochne par chavaan ne kaha ki yah donon dal saath aayenge, kya is baat ko pehle kabhi sochaa ja saktaa tha
 But both came together and it became a winning formula
 har rajya ke liye jeet kaa apana alag formula hota he
 The coming together of Congress and NCP in our state Maharashtra is a winning formula
 unhone ek prashn ke jawaab main kaha ki vipaksh main congress hi ek aisi party he jisaki puure desh main upasthiti he, bhale hi vah kam-zyada ho sakati he
 Chavan admitted that in any state where the third power is strong, the Congress has been marginalized such as Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar or West Bengal
 lekin yadi aap puure desh ko mila kar denkhenge to ham hi sabase bada vipakshi dal hai
 You cannot imagine such a situation now that the Congress can be seen or the Congress has become irrelevant
 tiares dwaara vipaksh kii ekta ke prayaas ke peeche kya koi ‚Äòadrishy haath ‚Äô ho saktaa he, is bare main poochne par unhone kaha, ‚Äò‚Äòmain nahin jaanata, par aisa ho bhi saktaa he
 What is the role of KCR, no one can tell
 ‚Äô‚Äô yadi ve congress ko kamjor karte hai to isse bhaajapa ko hi phayda milegaa
 About the Karnataka election, he said that the party has clearly declared Siddaramaiah as its chief ministerial candidate
 unke netritv main rajya main chunaav ladenge or rahul gandhi bhi apni bhoomika nibhaaenge
 In response to a question, he believed that if the fractured mandate came in the state assembly elections, JDS would play an important role in that situation
 ‚Äò‚Äòmain is baat ko lekar kaaphi chintit hum ki yadi spasht faisla nahin aayaa to yah log (bhaajapa) chunaav ke baad kii jane vaali jodtod main kaaphi maahir hai
 '' karnataka main kya jades bhaajapa se haath mila sakati he, is bare main poochne par unhone kaha, ‚Äò‚Äòdevgauda to iske bahut khilaaf hai
 But Kumaraswamy's address is not known
 ‚Äô‚Äô Asked what would be the role of Chavan in Rahul Gandhi's decision to form Udayaman (resurgent) Congress and whether he is ready to take responsibility at the central level, he said that the decision will be entirely for leadership
 abhi rajyasabha kii seat kaa maamla tha jo kumaar ketakar ko di gayi
 
 
 i am very busy with state issues right now
 bhaajapa evam shivasena ke rishton ke bare main poochne par chavaan ne kaha ki ek raajnneetik vishleshak ke taur par unka maananaa he ki bhaajapa kabhi shivasena ko apane saath se alag nahin hone degi
 If Hindutva votes are divided in the Lok Sabha elections, then trouble will arise for him
 bhaajapa ko bahut nuksaan hoga
 Right now both of them have 42 seats out of total 48 seats
 ‚Äò‚Äòve loksabhaa chunaav main yah kar hi nahin sakate
 He will not allow them to separate from any way by adding arms and legs, by showing files, by putting pressure, by fear of jail, that is, stuff, price, punishment
 ‚Äô‚Äô Chavan also expressed apprehension that any move could be done to break the alliance between Congress and NCP
 unhone shivasena ke congress evam rakanpa ke saath aane kii sambhaavna se bhi inkaar kiya
 He also said that if BJP and Shiv Sena fought separately then we could benefit greatly
 chavaan ne kaha ki maharashtra main in do gathbandhanon ke alaava dalit partiyon kii bhi mahatvapurn sthiti ho sakati he
 They are very divided
 ek taraf prakaash ambedkar hai
 On the other side is Ramdas Athawale, who is with the BJP
 bhima-koregaanv ghatana ke baad bahut tanaav ho gaya he
 Hence it has many dimensions
 maharashtra main dalit raajnneeti kii bahut badi bhoomika he
 The comments sharad pavaar ke netritv vaale rakanpa se gathbandhan ke bare main chavaan ne kaha ki donon hi dalon ke varisht netaaon kii yah soch he ki inke bich gathbandhan aprihaary he
 The march of the peasants by the communists has been supported by all opposition parties
 isliye samaan vichaaron vaali partiyon kaa samjhauta ho saktaa he
 There can be consensus about seat sharing
 unhone is tarah ke gathbandhan main shivasena ko saath lene kii sambhaavna ko nakaarte hue kaha ki jab tak shivesna dharmanirpekshata kii kasuti par nahin kasi jaati he tab uskaa saath nahin diya ja saktaa
 Chavan, citing a comment by UPA Chairperson Sonia Gandhi at the recently concluded plenary, said that it had a clear message that the work that could be done after the Shimla conference could also be done in 2019

 He said that Congress President Rahul Gandhi has yet to make his team

 Asked about the Congress not joining the SP-BSP winning coalition in Uttar Pradesh, Chavan said that these two parties will come together, could this have ever been imagined
 kintu donon saath aaye or yah ek jeet kaa formula ban gaya
 Each state has its own formula for victory
 hamaare rajya maharashtra main congress or rakanpa kaa saath aana jeetne kaa formula he
 In response to a question, he said that the Congress is the only party in the opposition that has a presence in the entire country, even though it may be less
 chavaan ne mana ki jis kisi rajya main teesri shakti majboot he vahaan congress haashiye par chali gayi he jaise tamilnadu, uttar pradesh, bihar yaa pashchim bengal
 But if you look at the whole country together, we are the biggest opposition party
 aap abhi aisi sthiti kii kalpana nahin kar sakate ki congress kii anedkhi kii ja sakati he yaa congress apraasangik ho gayi he
 Asked if there could be an 'invisible hand' behind trs's efforts for unity of opposition, he said, "I don't know, but it can happen
" kesiar kii kya bhoomika he, koi nahin bataa saktaa
 "if they weaken the Congress, then only BJP will benefit from it
" karnataka chunaav ke bare main unhone kaha ki party ne siddharmaiya ko spasht taur par apana mukhyamantri pratyaashee ghoshit kiya he
 Under his leadership, he will contest elections in the state and Rahul Gandhi will also play his role
 ek sawaal ke jawaab main unhone mana ki yadi rajya vidhansabha chunaav main khandit janadesh aayaa to us halaat main jades mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaayegaa
 "I am deeply concerned that if a clear verdict is not forthcoming, these people (BJP) are very adept at manipulations to be done after the elections
" ‚Äô‚Äô Asked about whether JDS can join hands with BJP in Karnataka, he said, "dev Gowda is very against it
 kintu kumaraswami kaa pataa nahin
 '' yah puche jane par ki rahul gandhi ne udayman (risergent) congress banane kii baat he, usamen chavaan kii kya bhoomika hogi or kya vah kendriya str par jimmedaari sanbhaalane ko taiyaar hai, unhone kaha ki yah faisla puri tarah se netritv kaa hoga
 Now it was a matter of Rajya Sabha seat which was given to Kumar Ketkar
 
 
 main abhi rajya ke muddon main kaaphi vyast hum
 Asked about the relationship between BJP and Shiv Sena, Chavan said that as a political analyst, he believes that the BJP will never let Shiv Sena separate from itself
 yadi loksabhaa chunaav main hindutv vaale vot bant gayi to uske liye pareshaani khadi ho jaaegi
 BJP will suffer a lot of damage
 abhi un donon ke paas kul 48 siton main se 42 siten hai
 "they cannot do this in the Lok Sabha elections
" vah kisi tarah haath pair jodakar, file dikhaakar, dabaav daalkar, jail kaa dar dikhaakar yani sam, daam, dand bhed se vah unhen alag nahin hone denge
 '' chavaan ne yah bhi ashanka jataayi ki congress or rakanpa kaa gathbandhan todane ke liye kisi bhi tarah kii chaal chal sakati he
 He also ruled out the possibility of Shiv Sena joining the Congress and NCP
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki yadi bhaajapa or shivasena alag alag lade to hamen kaaphi phayda ho saktaa he
 Chavan said that apart from these two alliances in Maharashtra, Dalit parties can also have an important position
 bahut bant chuke hai
 On one side is Prakash Ambedkar
 duusari taraf ramdaas athavle hai, jo bhaajapa ke saath hai
 There has been a lot of tension after the bhima-koregaon incident
 isliye iske kai aayam hai
 Dalit politics has a big role in Maharashtra
 tippaniyan Regarding the alliance with Sharad Pawar-led NCP, Chavan said that senior leaders of both the parties are of the view that an alliance between them is inevitable
 abhi communiston dwaara kisaanon kaa jo march nikaala gaya, use sabhi vipakshi dalon ne samarthan diya
 Therefore, parties with similar views can be compromised
 seat bantwaare ke bare main sahmati ban sakati he
 He ruled out the possibility of taking the Shiv Sena with him in such an alliance, saying that unless Shivesana is a test of secularism then it cannot be supported
 unhone ek prashn ke jawaab main kaha ki vipaksh main congress hi ek aisi party he jisaki puure desh main upasthiti he, bhale hi vah kam-zyada ho sakati he
 Chavan admitted that in any state where the third power is strong, the Congress has been marginalized such as Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar or West Bengal
 lekin yadi aap puure desh ko mila kar denkhenge to ham hi sabase bada vipakshi dal hai

 In response to a question, he believed that if the fractured mandate came in the state assembly elections, JDS would play an important role in that situation
 ‚Äò‚Äòmain is baat ko lekar kaaphi chintit hum ki yadi spasht faisla nahin aayaa to yah log (bhaajapa) chunaav ke baad kii jane vaali jodtod main kaaphi maahir hai

 There have been reports of escalation of talks between India and Pakistan on the proposed corridor to provide the facility of direct travel to the Kartarpur Sahib Gurdwara in Pakistan
 bharosa kaayam karne ke aise upaay par jitna aam taur par vichaar kiya jaataa he, in khabaron par usase kuch zyada der tak sochna munasib hoga
 Easy movement of pilgrims has been demanded for the last few years
 is ghatnakram ko lekar itnaa zyada talmail or sakriyata paidaa hogi, isane sabase patibaddh pairokaron ko bhi hairaani main daal diya hoga
 The foundation stone of the corridor was done by the Vice President of India and the Prime Minister of Pakistan in their respective part in November 2018
 aam chunaav main jeet par pradhanmantri imran khan kii badhai kii chitthee ke jawaab main pradhanmantri narendra modi ne pichley maheene galiyare ko jaldi chaalu karne kaa aahvaan kiya tha
 The two sides have been reported to have moved far ahead on a wide range of issues, including documents, the number of pilgrims ‚Äî the motive being told that pilgrims may visit the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak to visit Kartarpur Sahib in November 2019
 isamen nayaa kya he? rishton main thodi garmi aane ke dinon main 'logon ke bich aapasi samparkon ko badhaava dene' kii baat dashakon se ek rivaaj kii tarah hoti ai he
 Hence the relaxation of visa requirements, the need for frequent contact between families who have been torn as a result of the outskirts, improving the infrastructure of the movement and meeting the demands of cross-border pilgrimages from the pilgrims ‚Äî these All have been a part of two-way agendas from the early 1950s to the Composite Dialogue and its discrete forms in this century
 badi siyaasi pahal ke saath-saath baj dafe logon ke bich aapasi sampark ko lekar nae or ahm faisle bhi liye gaye hai
 When the diplomatic relations were restored in 1977 after the 1971 war, the delhi-lahore train service suspended since 1965 was resumed
 1999 main pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi kii mashhoor 'bas yatra' ke saath dilli-lahore bas seva shuru hui
 In 2006 ‚Äî that is, in the early years of composite dialogue or composite negotiation ‚Äî there was a major step taken to reopen the closed khokhrapar-munabav rail since the 1965 war across the sindh-rajasthan border
 saath hi dharmasthalon ke darshan ke liye badi chhot di gai
 The direct bus service from Amritsar to Nankana Sahib Gurdwara revealed that pilgrims have special needs and governments have to meet them
 in pahal main sabase khaas srinagar or mujaffarabad ke bich bas seva thi or baad main poonch or rawalakot ke bich bhi
 Since they meant movement across the Line of Control, they showed how much elasticity and scope the diplomatic tools have
 to kya kartarpur galiyara is lambey silsile kii ek or kadi bhar he? aisa bhale hi lage, par ek ahm fark he
 Most of these decisions that brought change were taken at a time when there was an era of improvement in india-pakistan relations
 kartarpur galiyare par baatcheet is lihaaj se hatakar he ki yah aise vakt hui he jab rishte buree tarah bigade hue hai‚Äîelosi par aae din sangharsh viraam ke ulalanghanon ke saath badtar halaat, pulavama, balakot, vagairah
 The internal developments in Pakistan have also not indicated any systematic effort to root out the militant factions and there is a constant concern in India that this corridor should provide a means to the Pakistani agencies to incite Sikh extremism and terrorism in some way

 Old cracks persist, but they do not prevent new ideas from emerging, and these ideas give a glimpse of new reality
