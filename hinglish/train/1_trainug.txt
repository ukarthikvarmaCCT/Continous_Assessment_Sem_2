 Ajay Maken even said that he did not rule out the possibility of disciplinary action against Janardan Dwivedi
 unhone kaha ki is par faisla party legi
 Heading the news with wrong intentions: Janardan After this Janardan Dwivedi once again clarified his statement
 unhone kaha, 'vahaan (intervyuu main) vishay chal rahaa tha ki congress chunaav kyon haari
 i said that Modi ji and BJP succeeded in convincing the public that he was much closer to Indianness
 agency ne jo khabar bheji uski heading de di ki maine modi kii tarif kii

 Quoting Dwivedi, it was written, 'modi managed to convince people that he is very close to Indian citizens from a social perspective
 unki jeet bhartiyata kii jeet he
 However, Dwivedi later told reporters that he had stated in an objective analysis that the 2014 election result was not a victory for Modi or BJP, but a Congress defeat
 mere jaise log nahin badalte vichaarunhone kaha ki modi or bijepi yah baat pesh karne main safal rahe ki ve bhartiya logon ke behad kareeb hai or unki jeet ko bhartiyata kii jeet ke rup main pesh kiya
 When this interview gave rise to speculation about his future action plan, Dwivedi said, 'people like me do not change their views and allegiance

 ) congress mahasachiv banane ke baad priyanka gandhi wadrachunavi rath par savaar hokar uttar pradesh ke maidan main utar padi hai
 Re-energizing the battered Congress in the state is a big challenge for Priyanka
 uttar pradesh main congress agar akele ladaai ladati he to usko ek saath do morchon par ladanaa he
 In which, on one hand there is BJP led by PM Modi, on the other hand there is a coalition of Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati
 log priyanka kii tulana purv pradhanmantri or unki daadi indira se kar rahe hai lekin priyanka ke saamne indira se zyada badi chunauti he
 When Indira Gandhi entered politics, she was accompanied by the legacy of Congress workers, Nehru and Lal Bahadur Shastri, and in the heart of the general public
 vipaksh ekadam nadaarad tha
 But there is a big issue with Priyanka at this time and the charismatic slogan like 'garibi Hatao' arose from the question whether Priyanka, Indira and father Rajiv's legacy will do politics at the center
 lekin is sawaal kaa jawaab congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne de diya he
 During the road show in Lucknow, Rahul Gandhi said that the Lok Sabha election is definitely the goal, but Priyanka will now form the Congress government in Uttar Pradesh
 matlab uttar pradesh main ab priyanka gandhi congress kaa cheharaa hongi
 In fact, the high command of the Congress has decided that it is not easy to get Uttar Pradesh with 80 Lok Sabha seats without being tighter
 uttar pradesh main kshetreey partiyon ke sahare chunaav ladane se acha he ki congress ko khud khadaa kiya
 For this, a big face was needed, which will now be compensated by Priyanka Gandhi
 vaise bhi sapa aup bispi ne apane gathbandhan main congress ko shaamil nahin kiya he
 Initially, some leaders of Congress were seen pleading with these two in the alliance, but later the Congress adopted an aggressive strategy and announced to contest the entire 80 seats
 isse phayda yah ho saktaa he ki congress ko apana coder majboot hoga or rajya main apni paith banane main madad milegi
 According to the strategy of Priyanka's team, the focus is more on those seats in Uttar Pradesh in which 20 percent or more Dalit voters are there
 indira ke samay dalit voter congress kaa votbank hua tha jo ab bispi supremeo mayawati ko apana netaa maanate hai
 At present there are 80 such seats in Uttar Pradesh, in which 20 percent or more are Dalits, while 17 seats are reserved
 vahiin priyanka kaa cheharaa savarna voton ko bhi lubhaa saktaa he, yah bhi kabhi indira ke samay congress ke saath hi tha
 It means that in Uttar Pradesh, the Congress is now trying to return to its roots with the help of Priyanka, for this, if Priyanka Gandhi Vadra is also a contender for the post of Chief Minister in the assembly elections, then there will be no big deal

 After this, the Sahara group parted ways with the BCCI after it was denied permission to replace Yuvraj with another player

 After November 1, the situation in this state will have changed completely
 rajya main kai tarah ke vikaas kaary ko badhaava diya ja rahaa he, yuvaaon ke liye naukariyaan nikaali ja rahi hai
 In such a situation, these youth still have time, they can leave everything and return
 ham chaahate hai ki vah is rajya ko aage badhaane main hamaare saath milakar kaam karen
 Let me tell you that a few days ago Satyapal Malik presented his roadmap for India in relation to Pakistan occupied Kashmir (pok) and said that India can withdraw that area without using any force
 iske saath hi unhone bharosa jataayaa tha ki rajya main suniyojit vikaas dekhakar vahaan ke log ‘vidroh' karenge or bharat main shaamil honge
 Addressing a function, Malik had said that some ministers are forcing the withdrawal of pok from Pakistan
 unhone haalanki kisi kaa naam nahin liya tha
 He said that for the last 10-15 days i have been seeing that many of our ministers
 pioke par hamalaa kar use waapas lene aadi ke bare main baat karte rahe hai
 i believe that if pok is the next target, then we can take it on the basis of development of Jammu and Kashmir
 ' malik ne kaha tha ki agar ham jammu kashmir ke logon ko pyaar or sammaan de sakate hai tathaa unke bacchon ke bhavishya ko surakshit kar sakate hai, vikaas or samruddhi laa sakate hai, to main guarantee de saktaa hum ki saal bhar ke andar pioke main vidroh ho jayega or aap ise bina kisi takaraav ke praapt kar sakenge
 The residents of pok themselves will say that they want to come to this side
 yah pioke ke liye meraa rodmap he
 Calling the countrymen to treat the people of Kashmir with love and respect, Malik said that officers have been deployed in every state to help Kashmiri students
 unhone kaha tha ki desh ke vibhinn rajyon main 22,000 kashmiri chaatr pard rahe hai or unke saath pyaar se pesh aayaa janaa chahie
 The people of Kashmir should be treated with love and respect

 After passing the Triple Talaq Bill in the Lok Sabha, the intentions of the Modi government are high, but the road to the Rajya Sabha (triple talaq bill in rajya sabha) is not looking so easy
 ek ore jahaan modi sarkaar (modi Govt)is bill ko rajyasabha main paas karana chaahegi, vahiin is bill ko paas hone se roak kar congress samet kai partiyon ko vipakshi ekta kii jhalak dikhaane kii bhi agni pariksha hogi
 For this bill could not be passed in the Rajya Sabha, the opposition is coming together and is demanding that it be sent to the Select Committee
 teen talaak bill par congress ke saath-saath samaajawaadee party ke sur bhi ek hai
 Both parties say that the bill should be sent to the Joint Select Committee before the bill is passed in Rajya Sabha
 bataa den ki kisi masale par jab bhi raajnneetik sahmati banani hoti he to aise main use jwanit select cameti ko bheja jaataa he
 The BJP has been the largest party in the Rajya Sabha, but not in the majority
 bill ke khilaaf partiyaan zyada taqatvar or lamaband hoti dikh rahininke alaava bhi kai saansad sarkaar ke saath nahin hai
 That is, the government does not have a majority here
 jabaki vipaksh bill main sanshodhan par ada hua he
 Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad told NDTV that the triple talaq bill should not have a provision for punishment
 civil lau ko criminal lau bana rahe hai
 Why is the bill being imposed on the community when it is not accepted? ham maang karte hai ki bill ko jwaint select cameti ko bheja jaae
 At the same time, on this issue, the Samajwadi Party is also melding in the tone of the Congress
 samaajawaadee party ke netaa ramgopal yadav ne kaha ki ham chaahate hai ki tripal talaak bill se teen saal kii sajaa kaa praavdhaan hataaya jaae
 The triple talaq bill should be sent to the Select Committee to remove the deficiencies
 bijepi kii ore se vijay goyal ne enditivi se kaha ki abhi teen talaak bill ko joint select cameti ko bhejne kii koi jarurat nahin he
 We appeal to all political parties in the Rajya Sabha to support the bill
 vahiin, bijedy netaa prasanna patsaani kaa kahana he ki yah ek samvedansheel bill he
 On this, the government should move forward by building consensus among all political parties
 itnaa hi nahin, ek baar main teen talaak (talaak-e-biddat) ko aparaadh ghoshit karne ke praavdhaan kaa virodh karte huye aam aadmi party (aap) ne kaha ki vah isse jude muslim mahila adhikaar sangrakshan vidheyak kaa ucch sadan main samarthan nahin karegi
 In the Rajya Sabha, AAP leader Sanjay Singh said on Friday that the party will oppose this bill brought to frighten the people of Muslim society in the name of ridding Muslim women of the practice of triple talaq
 vipaksh ke taraf se pehla sanket ki vah rajyasabha main bill paarit nahin hone degaa
 Please tell that this bill was passed in the Lok Sabha on Thursday and now it will be brought in the upper house
 rajyasabha main is bill ko paas karana modi sarkaar ke liye isliye bhi aasaan nahin he, kyonki rajyasabha main bijepi ke paas bahumat nahin he
 It is expected that this bill may be brought in the Upper House next week
 dakshin africa ke khilaaf salaami ballebaaj shikhar dhawan ke match vijeta shatak kii tarif karte hue bhartiya captain mahendra singh dhoni ne kaha ki baayen haath ke is ballebaaj ne shatak puraa karne ke baad bhi krij par samay bitaakar samajhadaari bharaa khel dikhaaya
 Dhoni is happy with the way Dhawan has strategized during his innings
 dhawan kii 137 ran kii pari kii madad se bharat 307 ran kaa score khadaa karne main safal rahaa
 Dhoni said after India's 130-run win, today he was batting in the same way as he does
 jab use bade shot khilne kii jarurat thi, to usne khele or vah strike bhi rotate kar rahaa tha
 He ensured that he remained at the crease even after completing his century
 dhoni ne kaha, yah mahatvapurn he ki agar aap shatak banaaen, to aap 130 yaa 140 ran bana paaen, aapako hameshaa team ko 20 se 25 atirikt ran banane main madad kerani chahie
 So it was good for him that he made sure that he would stay till the end, as openers usually try to play big shots after 25 overs
 unhen lagata he ki unka kaam puraa ho gaya
 But i think you should take full advantage of this situation after getting into rhythm

 The future of the alliance is seen going down in the Lok Sabha elections
 somvaar ko bahujan samaaj party kii pramukh mayawati ne dilli main samiksha baithak kii or yahaan jo unhone kaha usase sanket mil rahe hai vah gathbandhan ke liye thik nahin hai
 Mayawati said that after the alliance was formed, the results were not expected
 mayawati ne do took kah diya he ki vah ab akele dam par chunaav ladegi
 Mayawati has said that she will review the alliance before working on further strategies
 mayawati ke is rukh ke baad raajnneetik galiyaaron main sawaal uthne lage hai ki kya samaajawaadee party or bahujan samaaj party kaa gathbandhan 2022 main hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav tak tik paaegaa
 Before the Lok Sabha elections and during campaigning, both the SP-BSP were claiming to win more than 50 Lok Sabha seats
 lekin nattejey puri tarah se ulat sabit hue, gathbandhan sirf 15 siton par simat kar rah gaya
 However, the BSP which was reduced to 0 seats in 2014 has now reached ten seats
 kyon fail ho gaya gathbandhan?chunaav se pehle to daawa tha ki sapa-basapa ne jo jaateey ganit feet kiya he vah bhaajapa ke liye hanikaarak hoga
 But it was clear in the election results that while the bsp's vote percentage remained the same, the Samajwadi Party's vote percentage also fell
 nateezon se saaf hua ki jo jati ganit kaa formula lagaaya gaya wo feet nahin hua or bhartiya janata party ko jativaadee se alag hatakar vot mila

 As soon as the proceedings commenced on Wednesday, the opposition members pressured them to discuss inflation under the adjournment motion, on which the Speaker gave the members giving notice on the subject an opportunity to speak on why they want to do so
 vipaksh kii netaa sushamaa swaraj ne kaha ‘ham kaarysthgan prastaav ke tahat charchaa isliye karnaa charchaa karana chaahate hai kyonki ham mahangaai nahin roak paane main sarkaar kii asafalataa ke liye uski ninda karnaa chaahate hai
 He said, 'our aim is not to topple the government

 Verma said here, 'mulayam Singh Yadav's stance on minority reservation is most surprising
 unhen to iskaa khule taur par samarthan karnaa chaiye, lekin chunaav main samay main vah yah kahkar samudaay main bhram failaa rahe hai ki vah aarakshan alpsankhyakon ke liye he, sirf musalamaanon ke liye nahin
 He said that the SP chief has been talking about giving 18 percent reservation to Muslims when his party comes to power after the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections, which is impossible and is just a hoax
 kabhi yadav kaa dahinaa haath maane jane vaale verma ne sapa pramukh kii musalamaanon ke tarafdaar kii chhavi par prahaar karte hue kaha ki vah is tabake ko lekar sirf ghadiyaali aansu bahaate hai
 He said that during his last tenure in the state, Yadav recruited 22,000 constables in the police, out of which 74 per cent were people belonging to one caste and the percentage of Muslims was not even one per cent
 verma ne kaha, ‘mayawati ne kuch is tarah kaam kiya maano ve puure pradesh ke mukhyamantri na hokar ek jati vishesh kii mukhyamantri hon
 Similarly, under Mulayam Singh Yadav, the Secretariat made 500 appointments and there were no Muslims among them
 ’muslim aarakshan ke bare main tippanee ke liye chunaav ayog kii notice milane kii ghatana kaa ullekh hone par, verma ne kaha, ‘maine muslim samaaj kii durdasha bahut najadik se dekhi he or vahi tasviir mere dimag main bani hui he, jiske chalate maine muslim aarakshan ko lekar vah tippanee kii
 He said, 'my comment was not inspired by politics
 maine pichde musalamaanon kii durdasha dekhi he, jinke paas jameen nahin he, rojgaar nahin he or aay kaa koi sthaayee jariya nahin he
 Dalits and people belonging to other classes have got the benefit of reservation, but despite joining the reservation quota prescribed for backward classes, Muslims could not avail reservation in competition from the powerful castes of that class, hence felt the need for separate quota for them Was done
 ’verma ne kaha ki pradesh main yadi congress kii sarkaar banati he to musalamaanon ke liye alag se aarakshan kota tay kiya jaayegaa, kyonki ve aaj tak nyaay se vanchit hai
 Verma, who himself comes from the backward classes, criticized the BJP giving separate quota to Muslims as a cut in the rights of backward classes and said that justice should be done to every section of society in a democracy
 verma ne kaha, ‘nishad or rajbhar jaisi nau or jatiyaan hai jo pichde varg main shaamil hone ke baavjood apane liye nirdhaarit aarakshan cote kaa phayda nahin uthaa paa rahi hai
 Therefore, separate reservation quota should be fixed for them on the lines of Bihar

 rajyasabha main jari gatirodhrajyasabha main sabhapati venkaiya naidu kii chetavanee kaa saansadon par koi asar nahin hua
 As soon as the proceedings of the House begin, the mps of TDP, TRS, Shiv Sena, Congress and TMC start shouting slogans in the well
 saansadon ke hangaame par sabhapati venkaiya naidu ne kaha ki sadan main placord dikhaanaa na sirfniyamon ke khilaafahai balki ye loktantr ke liye bhi acchhee baat nahin he
 He said that we have come here to discuss, discuss and take decisions, mps are insulting themselves
 mangalvaar ko sabhapati ne sadan kii kaarywahi sthagit kar sabhi dalon ke netaaon ke saath baithak bhi kii thi
 So upset are the discussions in the corridors of the Speaker's Parliament that the Chairman is not only angry with the behavior of the mps but also surprised
 hangaame kii vajah se sabhapati beeti raat so bhi nahin paae or isse unki patni ushaa naidu kaaphi chitint hai
 Throughout the night, the voice of uproar echoed in Chairman Naidu's ears
 sadan main lagaataar placord dikhaae jane se wo pareshaan hai
 The deadlock continues in the House since the beginning of the second part of the Budget session
 tidipi saansad andhra pradesh ko vishesh rajya kaa darja dene kii maang par ade hai or wel main aakar beete teen din seposter or placardlaharaa rahe hai
 At the same time, DMK and AIADMK mps are also making a ruckus on the Supreme Court's decision and the formation of the board on the Cauvery water dispute
 iske alaava congress or tiemasi bank ghotaale or neerav modi ko lekar sadan main joardaar hangaamaa kar rahi he
 The sloganeering and uproar is so much that the sloganeering and noise in the Parliament House has become so difficult that it has become difficult to listen to what the Asan said
 rajyasabha main jor-jor se neerav modi waapas lao, chota modi waapas lao ke naare lagaataar lag rahe hai
 In such a situation, the concern of Chairman Venkaiah Naidu is genuine
 sabhapati kii koshish yahi he ki sarkaar or vipaksh charchaa ke liye taiyaar hon taaki sadan ko sucharu dhang se chalaaya ja sake

 ) duniya ke 26,00 shaharon main se bharat ke chaar shaharon ko hyperloop project liye chunaa gaya he
 In January, the company identified a route for worldwide hyperloop under the Global Challenge where it could be set up
 iske liye pehle 2,600 jagahon ko chunaa gaya jiske baad semifinal ke taur par sirf 17 deshon ko chunaa gaya
 Eventually, the company has finalized five countries
 kya he Hyperloop?aane vaale vakt main train ke safar ke tareeke or samay main bada badlaav aa saktaa he
 This will be possible with hyperloop technology
 Hyperloop ek aisa madhyam he jise lambii duuri minuton main tay kii ja sakati he
 American company Tesla and Space x have started it together
 hiparloop main ek sil kii tub kii siries hoti he jiske jariye kisi bhi gharshan or hawa ke rukawat ke bina logon ko ek jagah se duusari jagah kii yatra karai ja sakati he
 There will be space for people as soon as the train
 Hyperloop One ne kaaphi pehle se ek contest yojit kiya tha jisamen duniya bhar ke jagahon ko hyperloop ke liye chunaa janaa tha
 Now the company has selected 10 places where the world's first hyperloop tracks can be created
 paanch deshon ke in 10 jagahon main bharat bhi shaamil he
 Also included are countries like the US, UK, Mexico and Canada where the track of hyperloop can be produced
 gauratlab he ki 26 aavedan main sirf 10 jagahon ko chunaa gaya he
 The CEO of NITI Aayog has praised this, saying that Rob Lloyd, the CEO of Hyperloop, wrote on the official blog, 'india's bid was strong in the entries sent for the contest and two routes have been selected here
 inamen bangaloru se chennai or mumbai se chennai shaamil hai
 Saitio Amitabh Kant of NITI Aayog has said at an event of hyperloop in India, 'how we expand the process of urbanization plays an important role in India's rapid growth
 bina disrapshan ke liye yah sambhav nahin he
 What Hyperloop has introduced is a change-making technology that will help many countries make the leap
 'the company first selected 2,600 locations where it is possible to track hyperloop and finally 10 were selected
 is contest main duniya bhar ke vaigyanik, ejeeniyar or innowators ne lups ke liye apane aavedan die hai
 The loop is called the tunnel through which Hyperloop One will send its pods that will carry passengers
 jin 5 deshon ke 10 jagahon ko iske liye chunaa gaya he ab inke pratinidhi or team ab hyperloop van ke saath kaam karengi or in 10 jagahon par trek banane ke liye gahan adhyan karengi
 Because much remains to be done to make this proposal real
 philhal hyperloop ek concept he, lekin isaki testing kii ja rahi hyaap hyperloop kii teji kaa andaja is baat se hilga sakate hai ki yah hawaizhaj or bullate train se bhi fast ho saktaa he
 If the concept comes to real life, then you can travel with a pod in the passenger tube
 is pod main magnetic leviation or kam friction yuj kiya jayega jisase iskaa movement kaaphi fast hoga
 Recently for the second time Hyperloop has been tested in a desert as a concept
 bharat main hyperloop ke adhikari lagaataar sarkaar se baatcheet kar rahe hai taaki yahaan trek lagane kii ijaajat mil sake
 Company officials have expressed hope that the Indian government will allow for this
 agar ijaajat mili to wo yahaan demonstrishan ke liye ek seoup taiyaar karenge
 In India, if this setup is tracked and successful testing is done, the distance from Bangalore to Chennai can be covered in just 23 minutes
 aapako bataa den ki chennai se bangaloru 334 kilometre he
 The distance from Mumbai to Channai is 1102 km and the Hyperloop project will be able to cover it in just 63 minutes
 sabase pehle 2012 main testla ke founder alon musk ne iskaa concept rakhaa or tab se abhi tak iskaa deveopment chal rahaa he
 Tesla officials want to bring it to India and they have told through demotion that passengers can travel from Delhi to Mumbai in an hour
 yah hawaii jahaaj se kii jane vaali yatra se fast or uske mukaable thodaa sasta bhi hoga
 However, the government has not yet given permission for this
 testing ke dauraan isaki speed 309 kilometre prati ghante rahi, lekin ise or tej karne kaa plan haiek saal tak company ne hiparloop kaa lo speed test kiya, lekin aakhirkaar isaki testing speed se kii gai he
 On July 29, Hyperloop One's prototype pod was released into a 500-meter-long test tube
 testing ke dauraan hiper loop van ne lagbhag 309 kilometre prati ghante kii raftaar pakadi
 The company claims that this is the fastest hyperloop test ever
 kuch maheene pehle hiparloop van kaa pehla pareekshan kiya gaya tha
 The company will continue its testing even further
 company ne ek root plan kiya he or iske mutabik abu dhabi se dubai ke bich ise 804 kilometre prati ghante kii raftaar se chalaaya jaae
 For example, a distance of 160 kilometers can be covered in just 12 minutes
 yani agar bharat main isaki shuruyaat hui to dilli se agra aadhe ghante se bhi kam main pahunch sakate hai
