 On Thursday, while the Janata Dal United, Congress and Rashtriya Janata Dal advocated the nationalization of the Grand Alliance in unison, on Friday, the JDU and Congress were stunned over the leader of the Grand Alliance

 congress or jadyu ke bich pradhanmantri ke cheharaa ko lekar kichakich par bhaajapa ne chutki lee he
 Senior leader Sushil Kumar Modi said that what would be better is that Nitish Kumar, Lalu Prasad, Akhilesh Yadav, Mulayam Singh Yadav, Mamta Banerjee and Naveen Patnaik all become prime ministerial candidates in 2019
 vaise susheel kumaar modi ne mana ki pradhanmantri vahi banegaa, jiske party main kam se kam 200 saansad honge

 vah 10 aktubar 1996 kaa din tha jab sachin tendulkar pehali baar captain ke rup main toss karne ke liye utre the or aaj us ghatana ke thik 17 saal baad is mahaan ballebaaj ne test cricket ko alavida kehane kaa faisla kiya
 Tendulkar was 23 years and 169 days old when he first landed as captain at the Ferozeshah Kotla Stadium in Delhi
 virdohi team thi australia or bharat yah match jeetne main safal rahaa tha
 But the king of records Tendulkar did not succeed as captain
 unhen do baar bhartiya team kii kaman saunpi gai, lekin vah team ko kabhi waisi safalataa nahin dilaa paae jaisi ki unase ummid kii ja rahi thi
 Under Tendulkar, India played 25 Test matches, but of these, India could win only four matches while losing nine
 is bich khud tendulkar ke pradarshan main kuch giravat dekhne ko mili
 He scored 51 in these matches
 35 kii ausat se 2054 ran banaae jisamen saat shatak shaamil hai
 Tendulkar captained the Indian team in 73 matches, if he talked about one-day cricket in another format of cricket, but he tasted victory in only 23 matches
 is bich bharat ne 43 match ganvaae or swayan tendulkar ne bhi maan liya ki vah ballebaaji kii tarah captaini main safalataa hasil nahin kar paaenge

 83 he
 Tendulkar became the captain for the first time in 1996 but remained the captain for a quarter of a year and the command of the Indian team was again handed over to Mohammad Azharuddin
 bhartiya team england main 1999 main khele gaye vishwa cap main kuch khaas kamaal nahin dikhaa pai
 This was also the time when Tendulkar's father Ramesh Tendulkar died and the star batsman had to return home from England

 His journey from copy writer to writer has been surrounded by much controversy
 ab tak 12 upanyaas likh chuke rushdi is saal 13waan upanyaas laane kii taiyaari main hai
 But today, we will tell you some things about the personal side, not just the writer's side but as a lover and spouse
 aisa sach, jo unki persenelity se bilkul mail nahin khaataa
 First of all, know that how his personal life came to the fore before the world came to light
 a few years ago, Padmalakshmi, his fourth wife, made many serious allegations against him
 padmalakshmi ne kaha tha ki salmaan main sex ke liye paagalpan he or ve ek kunthit vyaktitv hai
 Padmalakshmi's book Padamalakshmi in her autobiography Love, Loss, and What We Ate said that Salman has an infinite desire for sex within Rushdie, as well as the sorrow of not getting Nobel
 unhone aarope lagaaya tha ki ek baar shaareerik sambandh naa banane par salmaan ne kaha tha unase shaadi karnaa ‘bed investment’ tha
 Padma told the world that Kirushdi needs care, good food and sex every moment
 ve kisi kii sthiti ko nahin samajhate the or yahi vajah thi ki unke saath physical hone main bhi kai baar takalif hoti thi
 Padma wrote, 'after marriage, i was undergoing treatment for endometriosis disease
 tabhi unhone sex karne kii baat kahi
 i was in a lot of pain
 manaa karne ve apaset ho gaye
 The next day they set out on a trip
 tab maine alag hone kaa faisla kiya
 'let me tell you that Padma has been a model by profession and the host of a foreign cooking show
 salmaan rushdi or padmalakshmi ke bich umr kaa ek bada faasla tha
 That is why when both of them married the society saw it by associating it with the ambitions of Padmalakshmi
 2007 main donon kaa divorce ho gaya tha
 Now read in Hindi, Salman Rushdie's book 'joseph Anton', Salman's wife Biaviansalman Rushdie did not have any first marriage which could not succeed
 isse pehle unki teen shaadiyaan or do bachche ho chuke the
 When she married Lakshmi in 2004, Lakshmi was 28 years old and single

 bhrashtachar ke mudde par ek ke baad ek ghotaale ujagar karne vaale arvind kejariwal ke mudde par purv army chif wike singh ne kataaksh karte hue kaha ki ve bhrashtachar ke khilaaf va deshhit ke liye kaam karne vaale har vyakti ke saath hai lekin aravind kejariwal jo ladaai lard rahe hai usase unka (general singh) koi taalluk nahin he
 Arvind Kejriwal and his path are completely different and he has no interaction with Arvind Kejriwal
 darasal general wike singh, gudgaanv ke gaanv ghamdoj main 1971 kii ladaai main shahid hue do phogiyon kii pratimaa kaa anaavaran karne aae the
 Here, he also honored the martyrs of the martyrs and did many things for the benefit of the country but Arvind was seen sarcasm on Kejriwal's issue
 tippaniyan Singh said that while memorials have been built in honor of martyrs in other countries, India Gate was built in Delhi only after the First World War in Gurgaon, after which no such monument has been built till date
 May the martyrs get respect
 yahi kaaran he ki aaj yuvaaon main fouj ke prati rujhaan kam hota ja rahaa he or aaj yuva army main ruchi nahin dikhaate
 Also, in the issue of One Rank One Pension, the Government has also cheated the soldiers, which is quite wrong
 bhrashtachar va janalokapal ke mudde par apni team bana sarkaar ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaane vaale aravind kejariwal jahaan lagaataar ek ke baad ek khulaase kar rahe hai vahiin, wike singh ne janhit main kaam karne va aravind kejariwal se alag raah chalane kii baat kahkar aravind kejariwal se kinaaraa kar liya he
 At the same time, suspense was also placed on his own participation in the Lok Sabha elections
 aravind kejariwal or unki raahen bilkul alag-alag hai or unki aravind kejariwal ke saath koi baatcheet bhi nahin he
 In fact, General VK Singh had come to unveil the statue of two soldiers killed in the 1971 battle at Ghamdoz village in Gurgaon
 yahaan par unhone shaheedon kii viranganaon ko bhi sammanit kiya or deshhit kii kai baaten to kii lekin aravind kejariwal ke mudde par kataaksh karte najar aae
 The comments singh ne kaha kii jahaan duusare desho main shaheedon ke sammaan main jagah-jagah smarak bane hue hai vahiin, gudgaanv main sirf pratham vishwa yuddh ke baad dilli main india get banaaya gaya tha jiske baad aaj tak aisa koi samaarak nahin banaaya gaya he jisase desh ke shaheedon ko sammaan mil sake
 This is the reason that today the trend towards the army is becoming less in the youth and today the youth do not show interest in the army
 saath hi van rank van pension kaa jo mudda uthaaya tha usame bhi sarkaar ne sainikon ke saath chhalaava kiya he jo ki kaaphi galat he
 Arvind Kejriwal, who raised his own team against the government on the issue of corruption and Jan Lokpal, is constantly making revelations one after the other, while VK Singh has kept away from Arvind Kejriwal by saying that he should work in public interest and walk separately from Arvind Kejriwal

 dm kaa kahana he ki iviem ke sanchaalan ke liye matdaan adhikari aprashikshit hai
 More than 350 evms have been replaced

 Sidhu also gave the slogan 'punjab, Punjabiyat and Punjabi' while clearing the future political roadmap
 kejariwal ke liye kaha- 'naam bade or darshan chote'siddhu ke khaas nishane par rahe aam aadmi party ke sanyojak arvind kejariwal
 According to Sidhu, for the past one-and-a-half years, only the people of 'AAP' were busy in lining up to take them with them

 Sidhu also cited the reason for leaving the Rajya Sabha
 siddhu ne kaha ki bijepi kii ore se unhen badal parivaar ke liye prachaar karne ko kaha gaya tha, jise unhone manaa kar diya
 Sidhu made it clear that he had taken this decision at his discretion, it had nothing to do with Kejriwal
 bataa den ki siddhu ne july main rajyasabha se istipha diya tha
 Since then, there have been speculations about Sidhu's future political move
 siddhu ne apane dil ke dard bayaan karte kaha ki ”bharat main ek parampara rahi he ki achche logon ko sajaavat ke saamaan kii tarah or sirf prachaar ke liye istemaal kiya jaataa he

 na to wo train se safar kar saktaa tha or na hi hawaii yatra
 Sleeping as soon as you sat down, and then such an echo of snoring which became a problem for other passengers
 uskaa sharir bhale hi so jaataa tha, lekin dimag is kadar jaag jaataa tha ki dekhne waalon kii ruh kaanp jaati thi
 In 6 hours of sleep, the mind was awake 453 times, and for one minute and 10 seconds, even the breath stopped
 yah koi kahani nahin balki hakeekat he, us shaks kii jo motaape kii vajah se sleep apnia kaa is kadar shikaar ho chukaa tha ki uski jindagi hi nark ban gai thi
 This story of soul shaking is that of coal merchant Mukesh Kumar living in Dhanbad
 mukesh kumaar kii umr kareeb 40 saal he
 For the past four and a half years, he was living like a disabled person due to his obesity and sleep apnea
 badi mehnat se khud apane pairon par khadey hone ke baad unhone apane kaarobaar ko jamaaya he
 After 2013, Mukesh was caught with obesity in such a way that his direct effect was visible on the business
 unka vajan 131 kilo ho gaya
 Mukesh Kumar suffered from sleep apnea due to obesity
 choubison ghanton neend jaisaa laganaa, aalas aana, baithe-baithe so janaa, neend se jaag janaa, neend main oxigen kaa ruk janaa, sir main dard rahanaa, bhaykanr kharrate lenaa jaise or kai lakshanon se vah jindagi se tang ho chuke the
 Things deteriorated to the extent that even sleeping with the other passengers in the train was bad for them
 train main safar ke dauraan puri bogi ke musafiron kii shamat aa jaati
 The sound of snoring was out of tolerance for the rest
 is pareshaani ke chalate ek hajaar kilometre tak kaa safar train ko chhod car se karnaa majaburi ban gaya tha
 Showed many well-known doctors from Dhanbad to Delhi
 sleep study kii to pataa chalaa ki 6 ghante 10 minute kii neend ke dauraan oxigen kii kami ke kaaran 453 baar dimag jaag jaataa he or oonchi aawaaj vaale 3500 kharrate aate hai
 In the sleep, breath was stopped for 1 minute 10 seconds
 doctoron kii salaah par sote vakt sirup mashin (oxigen kii supplai karne vaali mashin) lagaai gai, lekin do saal baat usase bhi baat nahi bani
 The whole house was troubled by his illness
 ghar main patni auki do bachche kharrate sunne ke aadi ho chuke the
 Due to obesity, there was a pain in his legs and back
 kaarobaar ko apgrade karne main 90 phisadi kii giravat aa gai
 Mukesh Kumar, fond of wearing branded clothes, also started feeling frustrated with the show room of clothes
 unki sies 48 ho chuki thi, jabaki aamtaur par 44 se bada sies nahin miltaa tha
 i wanted to eat spicy chili-spicy food throughout the day
 mukesh boj ban chuki jindagi ko jaise-taise kaat rahe the
 But the sleep sickness kept them shaking from top to bottom
 ye koi saadhaaran beemaari nahin thi
 Quickly consulted a doctor
 puri jaanch karne ke baad doctor ne saaf kah diya ki yaa to wo saans kii nalee ke upar jami hui charbi ko oparation karwaakar use nikalava den, yaa phir 6 maheene main vajan kam kar len, varanaa unke sharir kaa koi ang damege ho jayega
 This thing of the doctor was really frightening
 tab mukesh kumaar ne khud hi beriatric surgery ke bare main pataa karnaa shuru kar diya
 After all the investigations for bariatric surgery, he chose the delightful Hospital Indore
 ghar se bagaiyr kisi ko bataae chupchaap apane dost ke saath mukesh indore chale aae
 Dr
 Mohit Bhandari answered his every question
 unhen bharosa jagaa or sidhe surgery ke liye raji ho gaye
 On 25 May 2017, an hour before the surgery, he called the housemates and told them
 surgery se teen din baad jo raat ai vah unke liye jananath jaisi khushiyaan lekar ai
 After four and a half years, he took rest
 aaj mahaj 4 maheene main unhone surgery se 33 kilo vajan gata liya
 Now his weight is 98 kg and the weight continues to fall
 ab unka kaarobaar din dooni-raat chauguni tarakkee kar rahaa he or aisa lag rahaa he maano unhen dusraa janm mila ho
 He says that the seductive hospital for bariatric surgery has proved to be the most trusted hospital in the country
 mukesh kumaar kii puri kahani neeche die video main aap dekh sakate hai
 What is bariatric surgery? Many people who are not able to walk, who have difficulty in breathing, have blood pressure disease, diabetes, such people are tested after the bariatric surgery
 yah surgery teen tarah kii hoti he
 The first is that if a person is eating more food then to reduce his diet i
e
 to shorten the stomach
 ise restrictive surgery kaha jaataa he
 The second surgery is Mal Exemptive Surgery
 isamen sharir main khaanaa ja rahaa hota he, lekin vah pach nahi paata
 The third type is metabolic surgery
 yah surgery diabetec marijon ke liye hoti he
 All three types of surgery are very successful
 metabolic surgery se badi sankhya main logon ko kargar ilaaj mila he or diabetes se hameshaa ke liye chhutkaaraa mila he
 Currently, 95% of diabetes patients in India suffer from type-2 diabetes
 isamen insulin kii kami marij ko nahi hoti, lekin sharir main ghoomane vaala insulin thik tareeke se kaam nahi kar rahaa hota he, kyonki yah rog pratirohak ban jaataa he
 This is all due to hormonal disturbances
 is surgery ke jariye hormone kaa santulan bana kar insulin ko active banaate hai
 This has completely eliminated diabetes disease
 kaise hoti he beriatric surgeriberiatric surgery lyposection surgery nahi he
 That is, fat is not removed from any surface of the body, but rather by reducing the unwanted size of the stomach or by correcting the digestive system
 saath hi surgery ke jariye bahut se hormonal badlaav bhi karte hai
 This surgery is extremely safe
 bharat main yah surgery karne vaale mohak beriatrix and robotics kii team ne isaki vishesh training france ke pratishthit santhaan se lee he
 This surgery is also performed through a robot at Mohawk Hospital, Indore
 robotics surgery manyaal kii tulana main behad acurasi vaali surgery he

 surgery ke duusare din se hi har din teji se vajan ghatane lagata he auki 3 se 4 maheene main 30 se 40 kilo vajan ghat jaataa he
 In India, obesity is now becoming deadly, India is third in the world
 Poverty and malnutrition was a serious problem in India till now, but now rapidly growing obesity may take the form of epidemic
 yah baat bhartiya chikitsa anusandhan parishad (isimr) ke ek adhyayan main kahi gai he
 Till now, the problem of obesity was spreading in the rest of the world, but now obesity is increasing in India too

 Many serious diseases are making homes in people's bodies due to obesity

 These diseases are self-inflicted due to higher than average obesity

 The United States of America is the first place where 15 to 18 percent of people are prone to obesity
 china main aise logon kaa hissaa 10 fisadi he, to tisare number par bharat he jahaan 5 se 8 pratishat log motaape kii samasya se jujh rahe hai
 Type-2 diabetes afflicts 50 million people in the country
 dablyooluechao yani vishwa swasthya sanghathan ke mutabik philhal desh main is beemaari se peedit madhyam auki nimna madhyamvargeey 80 fisadi logon kii maut ho jaati he or yah aankada 2016 se 2030 ke bich doguna ho jayega
 Similarly, according to 'the Lance Global Health', India has the highest number of people who have suffered heart attacks
 bharat main isaki mrityudar 23 fisadi, jabaki south-east asia main 15 fisadi, china main 7, south africa main 9 or west asia main 9 fisadi he
 Obesity is the biggest reason behind both serious diseases
 aisi tamaam gambhir bimariyon se grasit mote vyakti kaa motopa dur hote hi ye bimaariyaan bhi gaayab ho jaati hai
 Obese more than average ie body mass index 32
 5 se adhik ho, unke liye beriatric surgery badi kargar he

 "jai jawan, jai kisaan"
 
 
 This slogan was given by Lal Bahadur Shastri, former Prime Minister of India
 is naare ke jariye samaaj main vah ek sandesh pahunchaana chaahate the ki kisaan or jawan desh kii disha or dasha tay karte hai, agar ye nahin honge to desh kii durdasha ho jaaegi
 While the soldier protects the country, the farmer gives grain to the country through agriculture
 agar kisaan nahin hoga, to ham sab apane aapako ek aise kone main paaenge jahaan haath main paisa hoga, lekin dana nahin
 
 
 Today when we hear the slogan of "jai Kisan", something strange happens
 aaj kisaan kii jai nahin, balki paraajay ho rahaa rahi he
 The farmer is hungry and emotional
 fasal barbaad hone kii vajah se kisaan aatmahatya kar rahe hai
 In Uttar Pradesh alone, more than 100 farmers have committed suicide in the last few months
 maharashtra, punjab, andhra pradesh or desh ke duusare hisson se bhi kisaanon kii aatmahatya kii khabaren lagaataar mil rahi hai
 Though the media keeps talking about the suicides of farmers, but it is probably not as serious as the media should be about this issue
 rajanetaaon kii ladaai main kisaan kaa jo asli mudda he, vah chup jaataa he
 Farmers 'bytes are less visible and politicians' more visible
 tivi channelon par kisaanon ke mudde par jab bahes hoti he, to khidki main kisaan nahin, rajaneta nazar aate hai
 Politicians also seem 'serious' about farmers in their own way
 koi raily ke jariye kisaanon kaa mudda uthaane kii koshish kar rahaa he, to koi muaavje kii baat kar rahaa he
 The Prime Minister himself seems serious for the farmer
 'man kii baat' se lekar raajnneeti ke manch tak kisaan kii baat kar rahe hai
 The Prime Minister has also increased compensation for farmers, which is a good thing
 lekin sawaal yah uthta he ki kya yah muaavja kisaanon tak pahunch paata he
 If it reaches, then how much is reached
 pichley hi dinon aisi khabaren ain ki uttar pradesh ke kuch ilaaqon main kisaanon ko muaavje ke rup main 50 se lekar 200 rupee tak ke check die ja rahe hai
 Just think, is this compensation or a joke with the farmers
 agar aisa hi haal rahaa, to chaahe kitna bhi muawza badha diya jaae, kisaanon kaa haal kabhi sudharne vaala nahin he
 i also come from the village
 jaanata hum ki kisaan apni kheti se kitna pyaar karata he
 Stays in farming from morning till evening
 jab bhi prakritik vipadaa aati he, kisaan bhaybheet ho jaataa he
 i have seen them being disturbed throughout the night
 agar baadh aane vaali he to pani ko kheton tak pahunchane se kaise roka jaae, isko lekar kisaan mashkkat karata rahata he
 If there is a possibility of a cyclone, they listen to the radio throughout the night to see how far the storm reaches and how much damage it will do
 jaraa sochiye jab kisaanon kii fasalein barbaad hoti hongi, to un par kya bitati hogi
 Farmers' suicide is nothing new
 neshnal krime record beuro ke aankadon ke mutabik 1995 se lekar 2013 tak 2 lakh 96 hazaar 438 kisaan aatmahatya kar chuke hai
 This is not a small figure
 2014 kii report nahin ai he, lekin 2013 main 11,772 kisaanon ne aatmahatya kii, jabaki 2012 main 13,754 kisaanon ne apni jaan de di
 These figures may be higher in 2014 and 2015
 bharat main jitani bhi aatmahatyaayein hoti hai, unamem kareeb 11 pratishat kisaan hote hai
 Politicians talk about the farmer, but no one reaches the farmers
 bhoomi adhigrahan kanoon ko lekar bhi kisaan pareshaan hai
 Political parties are surrounding each other with this law
 congress kisaanon ke jariye apni zamin banane main lagi he, to bijepi bhoomi adhigrahan kanoon ko lekar kisaanon kii kismat badalane kii baat kar rahi he
 But for which the law is made, there is no improvement in its condition
 sirf raajnneeti ho rahi he
 Nitin Gadkari has challenged Sonia Gandhi and Anna Hazare for an open forum debate on the Land Acquisition Act
 sonia gandhi bhi peeche hatane ko taiyaar nahin hai
 The things which she could not do in 10 years during her party's rule, she is doing now and is seen standing in the fields with the farmers
 agar nitin gadakari kisaanon kii samasya ko lekar itnaa gambhir hai to unako pehle kisaanon ke paas pahunchnaa padegaa or kisaanon ko is kanoon ke bare main samajhaana padegaa
 In the state from which Nitin Gadkari comes, most farmers have committed suicide
 maharashtra main 2013 main 3,146 kisaanon ne apni jaan de di thi
 Are we really serious about the problem of all farmers? Maybe, I'm not either
 mere lekh main kisaanon ke saare mudde saamne nahin aae honge, lekin mujhase zyada un logon ko is mudde ko gambhirtha se lenaa chahie, jo kisaanon ko lekar apni kismat chamakaana chaahate hai, subah se lekar shaam tak is mudde par raajnneeti karte rahete hai
 The issue of farmers can be resolved on a day when all political parties will fight unitedly for the rights of farmers instead of doing politics on this issue

 However, the court opined that the petition was based on mistaken belief and ignorance of already available laws

 shivasena ke mukhpatr saamanaki sampadakeey main buudhvaar komukhyamantri devendra fadanviske vidarbha ke mudde par die gaye bayaan ko lekar tikaa tippanee kii gai he
 Saamana said that after becoming the Chief Minister, he received a grand reception in Nagpur, but he spoiled it with his controversial statement
 vidarbha mudde ko taal sakate the CM fadanvisamukhyamantri ne chaati chaudeekar kaha ki vidarbha ko uchit samay par alag kiya jayega
 Does it suit the Chief Minister to make such statements? wo is mudde ko taal bhi sakate the lekin unhone aisa nahin kiya, agar wo kehete ki vidarbha ke vikaas ke liye kisi bhi tarah kii kami nahin rakhi jaaegi to shaayad acha hota lekin unhone aisa nahin karke maharashtra ke kesaryukt doodh main namak daalane kaa kaam kiya
 In the editorial of Saamana, when the Mughals had created panic all around and many powerful people from all over the country had laid down their arms, Bhavani's sword was raised in Maharashtra, so Maharashtra had an independent state when compared to the nation and Maharashtra Role can be
 saamana main fadanvis par tikaa karte hue kaha gaya he ki bhaajapa ko is baar vidarbha se baari janamat mila he
 They have got the most seats, but do not misunderstand this mandate of Vidarbha, it should not be thought that this mandate is to break Vidarbha from Maharashtra
 vidarbha ko maharashtra se alag karnaa yani bete ko uski maa se todna he
 The keeper of Maharashtra itself was told in the scam that the new Chief Minister of Maharashtra should also avoid using such language which breaks Maharashtra
 unke mukh se nikle ye shabd aisa prathit karavaate hai, jaise maharashtra kaa rakhwala hi ghotaale karne ko tatpar he
 Vidarbha is backward and it is the duty of the Chief Minister to remove his backwardness
 maharashtra kii bhagdaud vidarbha ke hi ek laal ke haath main he aise main vidarbha kaa vikaas karnaa hi mukhyamantri kaa pratham kartavya he or agar wo aisa nahin karte he to ye vaisaa hi hoga jaise oparation theatre main marij kii surgery karne gaya doctor surgery ke aujaaron ko ekataraf rakhkar baahar aa gaya
 Strict words in Saamna say that Sudhir Mungantiwar is now the new Finance Minister and Fadnavis is the Chief Minister
 aise main maharashtra kaa jamaadkhaan unke haath main janata ne saunpa he taaki sarthak kaam kiya jaae lekin aap kahin galat nirnay lekar shuruyaat hi apshagun se mat karnaa
 Fadnavis's support on the Nagpur session of the Legislature, in an editorial in the committee, gave Fadnavis some comfort and further said that we are in agreement with Devendra in which he said that the Nagpur session of the Legislature should run for a full six weeks in which all the pending issues After discussing it, it came to a final conclusion
 pichley kai saalon se vidhanmandal ke sheetakaaleen adhiveshan ko lekar kotahi barti ja rahi thi
 In such a situation, Nagpur is the deputy capital of Maharashtra and the session there should not be completed like a ritual and this session should conclude about the problem of Maharashtra as well as Vidarbha and their solution, on which the ruling party and the opposition Both agree
 saamana main di gai fadanvis ko chetavaneesamna ke aakhri kollam main fadanvis ko chetavanee bhi di gai he ki jharkhand, uttarakhand or chhattisgarh kii qatari main vidarbha bhi hoga, aisa koi na soche
 The Chief Minister says that the mistake that the Congress made in the division of Andhra will not happen in the division of Vidarbha, but comparing Maharashtra with a united Andhra Pradesh and talking of partition is nothing less than a major crime and nobody Think that it will be done in Maharashtra as well as in other states, unanimously saved

 Bollywood actress Sridevi died in Dubai on 24 February
 28 farvari ko mumbai main unka antim sanskaar kiya gaya
 Despite the passage of a week, the family and fans are still missing the actress
 shridevi kii badi beti jahnavi ne maa ke nidhan ke baad pehali baar instagram par ek bhavuk post share kiya he
 He wrote, We lost our mother but father died
 jahnavi-khushi ke saath shridevi- nahin dekhi hongi ye RARE photosxaraasala, 7 march ko jahnavi kaa janmdin he
 Sridevi used to congratulate her on her birthday by posting cute pictures of her childhood often
 is baar jahnavi ne janmdin se pehle instagram par ek post share kar likhaa, 'mere apane janmdin ke maukey par aap sab se sirf yahi baat kahana chaahati hum ki aap apane mata-pita se pyaar karte hai
 Keep loving them and dedicate yourself to feel that love
 unhone aapako banaaya he or main kahana chaahati hum aap meri maa ko yaad karte hai, shanti ke liye unki aatma ke liye prarthana karen
 Continue your love and appreciation for them
 'jahnavi ne logon se mata-pita ke relationships ko sammaan dene kii baat bhi kahi
 He wrote, 'please know that my mother used to give most love to someone, then she was a father
 or unka pyaar amar he kyonki puri duniya main aisa kuch nahin tha khushi se bhar dene vaala
 As dedicated as they were to each other, hardly any other could ever happen
 kripaya is baat kaa sammaan karen
 'mom' till the cremation 'mom' Sridevi's head stood like this khushi-jahnvijahanvi wrote, 'I and Khushi lost our mother, but the father lost his life
 vah sirf ek actress, maa yaa patni nahin balki usase bahut adhik thim
 She was the best and unmatched in every character she played
 unki jindagi main pyaar dena or pyaar paanaa ahmiyat rakhata tha
 Being nice and kind to people and never understood what frustration, frustration or jealousy is
 isliye wo jaisi thim unhen usee tarah pyaar den
 This thing may keep him happy even after his death and he feels that he had given you something sometime
 keval achche se bharen or keval prem den yah use khush karne ke liye, yah jaananaa ki mrityu main bhi, usne aapako sab kuch diya tha
 Thank you for loving and helping us over the last few days
 ye hamen aashaa or takat de rahaa he or ham aapkaa jitna shukriya adaa karen utana kam hoga
 'on my birthday, the only thing i ask of all of you is that you love your parents
 Cherish them and devote yourself to making them feel that love
 They have made you
 And i ask that you remember my mother fondly, pray for her soul to rest in peace
 Let the love and adulation you'll showered on her continue and please know that the biggest part of my mother was the love she shared with papa
 And their love is immortal because there was nothing like it in the whole world
 Nothing as joyful and pure and no two people as devoted to one another as they were
 Please respect that because it hurts to think anyone would ever try to tarnish it
 Preserving the sanctity of what they had would mean the world not only to my mother but also to a man who's entire being revolved around her, and her two children who are all that remains of their love
 Me and Khushi have lost our mother but papa has lost his “jaan”
 She was so much more than just an actor or a mother or a wife
 She was the ultimate and the best in all these roles
 It mattered a great deal to her to give love and to get love
 For people to be good and gracious and kind
 She didn't understand frustration or malice or jealousy
 So let’s be that
 Let's be full of only good and give only love
 That would make her happy, to know that even in death, she gave you all something
 The courage and inspiration to fill yourselves with nothing but love and rid yourselves of bitterness in any way and form
 That’s what she stood for
 Dignity, strength and innocence
 Thank you for the love and support everyone has shown us in the past couple of days
 It's given us hope and strength and we can't thank you all enough

 Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan will write a letter to Sonia Gandhi and complain about Digvijay Singh
 ve sonia gandhi se milane ke liye samay bhi maangenge taaki wo sidhi shikaayat kar saken
 Shivraj says that leaders like Digvijay Singh and Kapil Sibal made fake cases against him
 shivaraj singh kaa daawa he ki hoicourt kii taraf se banaai gai esaiti ne 'team digvijay' kii taraf se lagaae gaye aaropon ko jhootha paaya or usne apni report hoicourt ko de di he
 Shivraj Singh Chauhan, who arrived in Parliament House, said in response to a question asked by NDTV India that he wanted to ask Sonia Gandhi whether fake charges were leveled against her with the consent of Sonia Gandhi or without her trust
 agar bina sonia gandhi kii jaankaree ke ye sab kiya gaya to kya party digvijay singh or kapil sibbal jaise netaaon par karrwai karegi
 According to Shivraj, fake charges were leveled against him in the name of Vyapam scam for three reasons
 pehla ye ki kai apradhi digvijay singh se taalluq rakhte hai
 Second, the Congress is eating up every election in the state
 aise main digvijay singh jaise netaaon ko lagata he ki bina shivaraj kii chhavi ko karaab kiye ve koi chunaav nahin jeet sakate
 And thirdly, it created a conspiracy to disrupt the development of Madhya Pradesh
 in tamaam sawaalon ke saath ve sonia gandhi se milanaa chaahate hai
 But will Sonia give time? Shivraj says that he is confident that when he asks for time, Sonia Gandhi will give him time
 chitthee likh die jane kii babat kuch samachar patron chhapi khabaron ko unhone bebuniyaad bataaya or kaha ki chitthee abhi likhi jaani he
 The comments ullekhneey he ki vyapam ghotaale ko congress ke tamaam diggaj netaaon ne kuch kagajaton ke sahare yah aarope lagaae the ki yah sab kaagaj mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan kii ore ishaara karte hai
 Not only this, the Congress leaders had also accused the Chief Minister's wife, besides some ministers, of being involved in the scam
 bataa den ki madhya pradesh main vyapam naam kii ek sarkari sanstha jo rajya sarkaar kii tamaam pratiyogi parikshaon ko aayojan karaati he
 Shivraj Singh claims that the SIT created by the High Court found the allegations leveled by 'team Digvijay' to be false and has submitted its report to the High Court
 sansad bhawan pahunche shivaraj singh chouhan ne enditivi india ke puche gaye sawaal ke jawaab main kaha ki ve sonia gandhi se poochna chaahate hai ki kya un par farzi aarope sonia gandhi kii sahmati se lagaae gaye yaa phir bina unako bharosa main liye
 If all this was done without the knowledge of Sonia Gandhi, will the party take action against leaders like Digvijay Singh and Kapil Sibal
 shivaraj ke mutabiq vyapam ghotaale ke naam par unpar farzi aarope teen vajahon se lagaae gaye
 The first is that many criminals belong to Digvijay Singh
 doosraa ki congress pradesh main har chunaav main munh kii kha rahi he
 In such a situation, leaders like Digvijay Singh feel that they cannot win an election without tarnishing the image of Shivraj
 or teesraa ki iske zarie madhya pradesh ke vikaas ko baadhit karne kii saazish rachi gai
 With all these questions, he wants to meet Sonia Gandhi
 lekin kya sonia samay dengeen? shivaraj kaa kahana he ki unhen is baat kaa bharosa he ki jab ve samay maangenge to sonia gandhi unako samay dengi
 Regarding the writing of the letter, some newspapers published the news, they called it baseless and said that the letter is yet to be written
 tippaniyan It is worth mentioning that Vyapam scam was leveled by some heavyweights of Congress with the help of some papers that all these papers point towards Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan
 itnaa hi nahin congressi netaaon ne kuch mantriyon ke alaava mukhyamantri kii patni par bhi is ghotaale main shaamil hone ke aarope lagaae the
 Explain that in Madhya Pradesh, a government organization named Vyapam conducts all the competitive examinations of the state government

 Former Union Minister Kapil Sibal has given clarification on former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's non-signing of impeachment motion against Chief Justice Deepak Mishra
 unhone kaha ki yah purna rup se galat he
 This has been a serious issue since the beginning
 unhone kaha, 'maine aapako angreji main bhi bataaya or hindi main bhi bataaya tha
 This is not a trivial matter and i gave an example that day that it is not a matter of drinking coffee
 soch-samaj ke saath koi bhi agar nirnay letaa he to badi gambhirtha ke saath, kyonki samvidhan kii baat ho rahi he or hamane jaan-boojh kar dow
 Manmohan Singh was not included, as he has been the former Prime Minister and as far as few other people are concerned, we did not want to disturb those people
 'congress sutron kii maane to manmohan singh ke alaava mahabhiyog prastaav par pi
 Senior leaders like Chidambaram, Veerappa Moily, Salman Khurshid are not signed
 iske alaava manish tiwari or loksabhaa main netaa vipaksh mallikarjun khadge bhi mahabhiyog ko lekar khule taur se sahamat nahin hai
 When asked that the process of impeachment you started in the budget session, what was the suspense in it and was there no consensus among your party about it
 
 
 iske jawaab main gulam nabi aaazaad ne kaha ki sahmati or asahmati kaa sawaal hi paidaa nahin hota
 Consent was there from the beginning, but as Kapil Sibalji said that was a serious matter, it is not that if there is a modest person, then it was necessary to think
 ek anya prashn par ki aaj supreme court main mahabhiyog ko lekar PIL daali gai he, is par sibbal ne kaha ki aapse bhi raay maang lete to acha hota
 Because you protect the constitution and if you keep your mouth shut then it will be a violation of the constitution
 ye poochne par ki agarsabhapatine isko khaarij kar diya, to aapke paas raste kya bachate hai, jawaab main sibbal ne kaha ki agar aise halaat aaenge to ham bhi aapako rasta bataa denge, samvidhan main or bhi raste hai
 Nothing has happened, neither did we mention, nor did they
 team india ne england se pichhali do siries main mili haar kaa bakhubi badla liya or 4-0 se aitihaasik jeet darj kii
 Earlier, he defeated England 3–0 under the captaincy of Mohammad Azharuddin
 matlab yah siries ke lihaaj se england par ab tak kii sabase badi jeet bhi he
 This win was also special for captain Virat Kohli in many ways and he made many records
 team india ko is sarij main of spinner jayant yadav or karun nair ke rup main nae sitare bhi mili
 While Jayant won the hearts with an all-round performance, Karun Nair batted unsuccessfully for the first two innings, batting historic in the third innings
 vastav main bharat main is samay do hi chizon kii charchaa sabase adhik he
 The first demonetisation and the second team India's win over England, but can you imagine that these two things can be related in some way
 
 
 haa inamen do or chijen jod di gayi or vah hai bracit or 'lagaan'
 
 
 By the way, the victory of cricket, Demonitisation and Brexit are not directly related
 haa yah alag baat he ki notebandi kii vajah se gharelu maichon par prabhaav padaa
 Several teams also demanded help from the BCCI, but the board refused help citing Justice Lodha panel
 phir jaise taise karke rajya sanghon ne apni tiimon ke liye sidhe vyavastha kii
 Anyway, why are many people in the country affected by demonetisation, but we are talking here about the series that ended on Tuesday between Team India and England
 team india ne jaise hi england par 4-0 se jeet darj kii, to phans ne use badhai deni shuru kar di
 Among the congratulators were cricketers as well as Bollywood celebrities, politicians and common cricket fans

 One should not be surprised at the absconding of Pakistani terrorist Naved Jatt in Srinagar Central Jail, as the security arrangements in this jail were bound to be relaxed
 sach to yah he ki yah jail aatankiyon ke liye jananath jaisaa he or yahaan aatankiyon ko internet vaale smartphone se lekar kashmiri 'vajwan' matan tak sab kuch uplabdh hai
 This has been claimed in a Times of India news

 ghatana ke baadaraajya sarkaar nedoctor nijaami or mansoor ahamed ko duty se hataa diya he
 However, jail superintendent Ahmed Rather rejects these allegations altogether
 ve kehete hai, 'ham jail menu kaa sakhti se paalan karte hai
 There is no question of using one's mobile phone inside the jail premises
 'gauratlab he ki kareeb das saal pehle jab siarpief ne is jail par chapa daalaa tha to use matan kaatane, kebab banane ke chaaku aadi hathiyaar or darjanon mobile phone mili the
 But even after that there was no change in the system of this prison
 siver kii safai karte hue mazdooron kii jaan jane kii durghatnaayen aam ho gai hai
 Statistics show that every five days a laborer's life goes away while cleaning the sewer
 kai baar aisa hua he ki ek majdoor pehle jahrili gas kii chapet main aata he phir use bachaane ke chakkar main dusron kii bhi jaan chali jaati he
 But now this will not happen, a robot is designed to clean the sewer
 iske aane se ab mazdooron ko siver main utarane kii jarurat hi nahin padegi
 Such a robot has also arrived in Gurugram adjacent to Delhi
 risk uthaakar hoti he siver kii safaijyaadaatar siver saaf karne vaale majdoor siver saaf karne ke liye kai tareeke apanaate hai
 He takes off with a rope tied to the waist, bucket in hand and shovel to clean the sewer

 MCG officials visited the generobotics production facility in Kerala
 unhone gurugram ke manhole ke ayaamon ke anukool banaaya or iskaa pareekshan bhi kiya
 The specialty of this robot is that it can be operated with the buttons without physically entering the sewer
 kaise hai robot, kya he isamen khasayah robot ek portable janarator or compressor se judaa hota he
 Its length is about 1
 5 meter he
 The robot weighs about 80 kilograms and can go deep and clean up
 ek maanav oparator manhole ke paas rahakar or niyantran kaksh par rangeen batan ke jariye siver ke andar ke robot ko nevigate karata he
 The robot's hands go inside the manhole and collect the concrete
 jabaki robot ke 'pair' mashin ko sthir karne main madad karte hai
 It has sensors to measure the level of gases inside the sewer, lights for night time use and waterproof infrared watch, as well as a camera for viewing inside views
 manual rup se ek siver ko saaf karne main teen se chaar ghante lagate hai
 At the same time, this robot can finish its work in 20 minutes
 yah robot ek din main 10 manhole ko saaf karne kii kshamta rakhata he
 Currently it is priced at Rs 32 lakhs
 lekin team is laagat ko or kam karne par kaam kar rahi he
 The most important thing is that no one needs to go inside the sewer anymore, so there is no danger of exposure to gases

 Smith played a slow but sensible innings and retained his team in the match
 unhone apni pari main 103 gendon kaa saamana kiya or 7 chauke lagaae
 Nathan started off slow, but played big shots as soon as he got into rhythm
 8 ran se apane pehle shatak se chukne vaale nathan ne sirf 60 gendon kaa saamana kiya or 8 chauke or 4 chakke lagaae
 With this, he has become the highest run-scorer at number 8 in the World Cup

 Apart from Stark, Pat Cummins took two and Adam Jampa took one wicket

 Gayle was angry at the umpire's decision, so he took a review which failed and the Windies were also disappointed with Gayle
 nicholas puuran (40) or shai hope (68) ne wicket par pair jamaaye or tisare wicket ke liye 68 ranon kii saajhedaari kar australia par dabaav bananaa shuru kiya
 This time, leg-spinner Adam Zampa gave relief to Australia
 unhone 99 ke kul score par puuran ko captain finch ke haathon kaich karaayaa
 Hope then joined Shimron Hetmeyer (21)
 yah jodi bhi zyada aage nahin ja pai or 149 ke kul score par shimron hetmer ran lene kii jaldbaaji main ran out ho gaye
 Hope was looking for one end
 captain jesan holder (51) ne unka saath diya, lekin is baar hope saajhedaari tod kar chalate bane
 He was caught by Cummins at the hands of Khawaja for a total score of 190
 hope ne apni pari main 105 genden khelin or 7 chauke maare
 Andre Russell, who had turned several matches in the IPL with his storm, was almost in the same position that the IPL had conveyed to him, but Russell could not repeat the success of the IPL and bowed out to Stark
 captain holder or carlos brathwet ne phir australia ko pareshaani main daalaa
 These were both pushing the scoreboard forward and reducing Australia's chances of victory

 Replay the replay of the way Mahendra Singh Dhoni was run out in the semi-final match against New Zealand
 dekhie ki guptil ne kahaan jaakar gend pakadi or kaise use thro kiya
 Actually it was Guptial's luck that his throw was directly in the stumps and Dhoni was run out
 khud guptil ne hi agle din yah baat bhi maani
 Had there been another player in place of Dhoni, he would have been run out on this throw
 dhoni darasal ek ran ko do ran main badal rahe the
 They have been doing this work before also
 jo mahaan khilaadi un par dhime hone kaa ilzaam laga rahe hai, ve shaayad apane puure kareer main utane tej nahin rahe jitne dhoni us din the
 It is not an argument that Mahendra Singh Dhoni should not retire now
 dhoni 15 saal se antarrashtriya cricket main hai
 Several years before that he had to cut into local cricket
 balki unka yah safar mumbai, dilli or chennai-bengalooru ke khilaadiyon ke muqaabale kahin zyaada lanbaa rahaa, kyonki ve ek aise shahar se the jahaan se chamakane vaali bijli bhartiya cricket kaa makka-madina bane shaharon tak pahunchate-pahunchate khatm ho jaati thi
 Obviously, the game will cost them much more than others
 ek din unako bhi ritair hona he or vah koi aisa din ho jab unke khel kii abha shikhar par ho to isse acha kuch nahin ho saktaa
 You leave the game when people start requesting you to join hands and get out of the field, then there is no nobility in it, but only a kind of contempt
 isliye yah tippanee yah samajhane ke liye nahin likhi ja rahi ki mahendra singh dhoni ko abhi ritair nahin hona chahie- yah faisalaa unako karnaa he or ve der-saber kar lenge- lekin yah bataane ke liye likhi ja rahi he ki hamaare yahaan chal rahe cricket vishleshan kis qadar tii-20 or ipiel kii dhooma-dhadaaka samskruti se aakraant hai
 Many players have had to bear the brunt of the national pressure of this analysis
 ambati raidu ko mahaj kuch pariyon ke pradarshan ke aadhaar par is tarah kaarij kar diya ki unhone cricket kii duniya ko hi alavida kah diya
 Rahul Dravid in one round and Cheteshwar Pujara were considered unacceptable for odis in this round
 jabaki jisane cheteshwar pujaara kaa khel dekha he, vah bahut sahajata se bataa sakate he ki ve jitne thos ballebaaz hai, utane hi behtareen stroke player bhi
 He can also be a solid number four batsman in the ODI team who can handle the innings in a crisis and give the team a great run rate in an emergency
 lekin vanade yaa tii-20 ko logon ne bas dhooma-dhadaake kaa khel maan liya he
 They act as if a player who does not have the power to hit two-fours and sixes in every over is a true international player
 hardik pandya yaa rishabh pant beshak bahut achche ballebaaj honge, lekin zyaadaatar log in par inaki lappebaazi kii vajah se fidaa hai
 The culprit that caused us to do harm in the World Cup semi-finals, is not the players, but the analysts who had hoped for a miracle
 vishwa cap 2019 main bhi dhoni ke pradarshan ko log aisi hi kasuti par kas rahe hai
 Those who are fuming that they did not try to win in the last over against England, do not understand that the target was almost impossible against the British bowling that day
 bat bhanj kar wicket gavaan dene vaali harakiri kii nai samskruti main agar dhoni nahin dhale hai, agar unhone hisaab laga liya ki yah match jeetna sambhav nahin hoga or yah bhi dekh liya ki is haar ke bahut bure nattejey nahin hone ja rahe hai or unhone pari chalaae rakhana behatar samajha to isamen kuch bhi galat nahin he
 He is credited with bringing the team out of a very difficult situation against New Zealand
 ran rate bhi unke niyantran main tha
 They simply fell prey to the uncertainty of cricket which is considered a game, otherwise it was very possible that they would have taken India to the finals
 darasal is match main rishabh pant or hardik pandya ko dhoni se pehle utaarne kaa faisalaa usee drushti kaa nateeja tha jisamen ham cricket ko sirf chauke-chhakkon kaa khel maan baithe hai
 No matter how talented these two are, they are not yet experienced enough to sustain their temperature for long - basically these two are the players to score forty-fifty runs within ten to fifteen overs - of course very useful in the last moments
 Change the color of a match in
 lekin is aakiri ank tak pahunchane se pehle hi unki bhoomikaayen shuru ho gayi
 Apparently, both of them returned to the pavilion after playing their game
 ab sirf kalpana kii ja sakati he ki agar dhoni chauthe number par aae hote or dhire-dhire team ko ek mukaam tak laane ke baad out bhi ho gaye hote to bachaa-khuchaa kaam nibatane ke liye rishabh or pandya jaise ballebaaz hamaare paas hote
 That story cannot be changed now
 lekin aane vaali kahaniyon ke kirdaaron kaa ham khyal rakh sakate hai
 The question is not about Dhoni, but for the Indian team's election
 bhavishya kii team banane kii koshish main ham vartmaan kii team na kho den
 Australia ruled the cricket world for nearly 20 years even if they did not choose and exclude players only on the basis of immediate talent
 mike hasi jaise nayab khilaadi ko test khilne ke liye tees saal se zyada kii umr tak intazaar karnaa padaa
 India is as shocked to break one team into another
 kahana mushkil he, iske liye pratibhashali khilaadiyon se saji bench kaa dabaav zyaada he yaa aise cricket jaankaron kaa, jo cricket ko tamaashe kii tarah dekhte hai or sochate hai ki dhime khilne vaala khilaadi puraane daur kaa khilaadi he
 New Zealand's Williamson is not a fast-paced batsman, but New Zealand almost won the World Cup because of his charisma at the World Cup
 guptil ko lagaataar karaab pradarshan ke baavjood newjiland team ne banaae rakhaa or semifinal main ek ran out se hi unhone kamaal kar diya
 If India had been a selector, then both Williamson and Guptil would have been dropped from the team
 darasal aisi chayan drushti kaa khamiaja sirf dhoni ko hi nahin, un yuva khiladiyon ko bhi bhugatna padegaa jinke kandhon par abhi se kuch atirikt boj aa jayega
 Because then there will be a campaign to exclude them on this basis
 philhal team jo bhi chune, ye na kahen ki dhoni dhime ho gaye hai

 emsidi chunaav main bijepi ko mili banpar jeet ke baad ab “koun banegaa meyar” sawaal uth rahaa he
 This question is also interesting because this time the BJP contested new faces by cutting tickets of all the councilors
 emsidi ke kanoon ke mutabik pehle saal teenon emsidi main mahila meyar hogi, isliye mahila parshadon ke man main bhi meyar kii kursi ko lekar ummiden udaan bhar rahi hai
 Home of Manoj Tiwari influx of new councilors BJP President Manoj Tiwari is surrounded by new councilors at home today
 makasad to jeet ke baad apane netaa ko badhai dena or unka aabhaar jataana he, lekin is bahaane meyar kii kursi par nazaren lagaae parshad apana cheharaa chamakaane main bhi peeche nahin rahete
 If someone shows his strength by stating the margin of victory, then one counts the experience of the work done for the party
 koshish yahi hoti he ki ab parshad banane ke baad emsidi main koi pad bhi haath lag jaae
 Aarti Singh's husband Gajendra Singh, who won from Mehrauli, is a minister in the Delhi Pradesh BJP team, did not forget to meet Manoj Tiwari that she had been a journalist before becoming a councilor
 saath hi ye bhi jataayaa ki kshetra main kaam vahi karengi, parshad ke kaam ke liye pati se nirbhar nahin rahengi
 The house of these leaders is also getting crowded, not only Manoj Tiwari but also at the rate of other party leaders, there are queues of councilors to place bets in the Kaun Banega Mayor contest
 pant maarg ke dilli bijepi mukhyalay ke pichley hisse main bane makaan main party ke sanghathan mahaamantri siddharthan rahete hai, dinabhar yahaan nae parshadon ke aane kaa silsilaa chalata he
 Women councilors do not forget to stake their claim to the post of Mayor as soon as they get the chance
 purvi dilli ke mayur vihaar 2 se parshad chuni gayi bhaavana malik ne principal ke taur par apane prashasik anubhav se sanghathan mantri ko rubaru karaayaa or lage haath ye bhi jataa diya ki agar parshad se aage kii zimmedaari unhen mili to use bhi wo bakhubi nibhaa sakati hai
 Babita Khanna, who has been elected councilor of Preet Vihar from East Delhi, is a yoga teacher in the Art of Living and is hoping that if the party prefers her ability, she will not be left behind in the bid for mayor
 south emsidi main shikha raay or kanwaljeet saharaavat ke naam sabase ageemsidi act main pehle saal mahila parshad ke liye meyar kaa pad arakshit he, isiilie mahila parshadon ke bich se hi meyar ke naamon ke lekar charchaa shuru ho gai he
 The names of Shikha Rai and Kanwaljit Sehrawat are at the forefront of the South MCD, but the names of Nandini Sharma and former councilor Sarita Jindal are also being strongly named
 uttari dilli main priti agarwal or mahila morchi kii adhyaksh punam parashar kaa naam charchaa main he, to purvi dilli main kanchan maheshwari auki purv parshad nima bhagat kaa naam charchaa main he
 Although Manoj Tiwari has already made it clear that the election of the mayor will be the test of Modi's dream, but it will be interesting that who will give preference to the experience of the organization or the experience of women who have been councilors

 Actually, this video has been shared on the facebook page called 'adorable Animals'

 On seeing the fishes, the woman gets frightened and is seen trying to save herself
 video dekhakar aisa lag rahaa he ki mahila pehle machhliyon kodolphinsamajhati he, lekin kareeb se dekhne ke baad mahila ko pataa lagata he ki ve teenon machhliyaan whale hai
 The woman is wearing a black swim suit, which is believed to be attracted to the woman by seeing the black color
 lekin raahat kii baat ye he ki teenon whalemchaliyone mahila ko kisi tarah kaa koi nuksaan nahin pahunchaaya
 From this it seems that the fish were in the mood to play with the woman, seeing only black color

 Barack Obama has become the President of the US for the second time in a row and his wife Michelle Obama has played a very important role behind this huge success, which he has also played with great dignity
 america kii pratham mahila se jab koi sawaal karata he ki ‘kya he mishael obama?’ to unka ek hi jawaab hota he ki vah sabase pehle maalia or sasha kii maa hai
 But when asked about her life before a mother, devoted wife, lawyer and public servant, she describes herself only as "the daughter of Fraser and Marianne Robinson"
 mishael ne white house ke jharokhe se america kii pratham mahila kii jo chhavi pesh kii he vah ek dabang or mahatvakankshi mahila kii nahin balki ek pyaari si maa or ek purna samarpit patni kii he or unki is chhavi ne bhi baraak obama ke vyaktitv ko nae aayam dene main sakaaratmak bhoomika adaa kii he
 Americans love this same image of Mitchell, and that is why Americans are more interested in Michelle than Obama

 adwani ne kaha ki unki 1991 main nikaali gai rathyatra ko badnaam karne kii sajeesh ke tahat vipakshi dalon ne use muslim virdohi qaraar diya
 Advani said in the website that no anti-muslim or wrong words were used in any of my speeches
 balki maine un logon ko roka, jo galat naare lagaate the
 He claimed that he can never be anti-muslim, but he will always oppose such efforts which are in contempt of the 82 percent majority population of the country

 The Congress prince Rahul Gandhi may claim to be against corruption and the entry of tainted leaders in politics, but the reality of politics has made him realize that doing politics without them is not easy
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki rahul ne ab yah kabool kar liya he ki chaara ghotaalaa maamle main jail kii sajaa kaatane ke baad jamaanat par chhutelalu yadav se haath milaneke alaava unke paas koi chaara nahin tha
 Talking to media persons on Thursday in Mumbai, Rahul said that Lalu's alliance with RJD for the Lok Sabha elections in Bihar can be seen as a change in his attitude towards corruption but he had no option left because Had the Congress lost some seats
 yahaan gaur karne vaali baat he ki ye vahi rahul gandhi hai jinhone daagi saansadon se jude centre sarkaar ke adhyadesh ko bakawaas qaraar dete hue ise fadkar phenk dene kii baat kii thi

 reliance jeeyo ke 4G speed kaa gubbaaraa kya sach main fat rahaa he? haal hi main duniya kii mashhoor speed test website Speedtest

 in is also confirming that Reliance Jio's 4G speed is the lowest in the country as compared to other operators
 gauratlab he ki TRAI kaa yah portal apane myspeed app ke jariye desh bhar se speed test data colect karata he
 According to the 4G coverage data recorded through the graph here, Airtel 11
 4mbps kii aivarej 4G speed ke saath pehle paaydaan par he
 In our 4G speed test too, Airtel won the game compared to Jio, whose video you can see below

 Reliance Jio has rejected trai's data, this is the company's statement
 After this report, Reliance Jio has argued
 company ke aadhikarik bayaan ke mutabik TRAI dwaara colect kiya gaya data sahi aankade nahin dikhaata
 This is because there is a limit of 4GB every day with Jio 4G data and this has not been said in the test

 mumbai kii ek actress ek din stage sho ke liye nikalati he, lekin vah naa to stage tak pahunchati he or naa hi ghar waapas lautati he
 This puzzle of an actress disappearing from the middle of the day in the middle of the road with a car confuses everyone
 lekin tabhi kuch aisa hota he ki har koi hairaan rah jaataa he
 Actress Alka Punewar (44), who played a role in films like 'gadar' and 'teri Kasam', mysteriously vanished one day, along with all the family members and loved ones
 do din guzarane ke baad bhi uskaa koi pataa nahin tha
 Police found a Maruti car in the ditch about nine hundred feet deep near the mumbai-pune Old Highway, on the other side of the road, which was found in a ditch nine hundred feet deep
 haadase kaa pataa karne ke iraade se jab pulisavaale neeche utre to maukey kaa manjar dekh kar sihar uthe
 All the cars of the car fell into the ditch, but despite the terrible accident, all the doors of the car were closed and no one was inside
 yahi nahin car ke andar yaa baahar khun kaa ek kataraa tak maujuud nahin tha
 Right now, the police were just finding out about the accident that Alka's husband Sanjay Punewar wrote the report of the actress wife's disappearance
 usne bataaya ki alka 27 disambar kii shaam se hi gaayab he
 He himself left his wife from his Maruti car to Kopri
 jab police ne alka ke car ke number se khai main gire car ke number kaa milan kiya, to vah alka kii hi car nikali
 The police reached an opportunity regarding Sanjay
 mobile phone mila, lekin memory card gayabpulice or sanjay ne jab alka ke mobile phone or duusari chizon kii talash shuru kii to jhaadiyon ke bich alka kaa mobile phone to mil gaya, lekin uskaa memory card or kol detail gaayab the
 When the police investigated the details of Alka's mobile, he found that during his disappearance, Alka had sent an SMS to a mobile number which had been closed for a long time
 jald hi police ko us shaks kaa bhi pataa chal gaya, jo is number kaa istemaal kiya karata tha
 This was Alok Paliwal, an engineer based in Bangalore
 police ko alok kaa nayaa number bhi mil gaya, lekin phone band tha
 While scrutinizing his call details, the police came to know of a person living in Panvel, who had had several conversations with Alok in recent times
 27 saal kaa sanjay sonkar bhi peshey se ejeeniyar tha
 The police picked up Sanjay and started questioning him
 khulne lage kai rajamumbai krime branch kii jad main alok paliwal ke dost sanjay sonkar ne jab munh kholana shuru kiya to alka punevar kii jindagi kaa wo sach saamne aa gaya, jiske bare main koi soch bhi nahin saktaa tha
 Sanjay told the police that 44-year-old Alka's relationship with her husband Sanjay Punewar was not very good and she was in love with 28-year-old Alok Paliwal
 teen saal pehle alok ke saath uski mulaaqaat kisi restraan main hui or iske baad donon ek-duusare ke kareeb aa gaye
 Alka had also taken a mobile number separately from which she used to talk secretly
 premi sang milakar alka ne rachaai sajishasanjay ne bataaya ki ek roj alka ne pati ko chhodkar alok ke saath nai duniya basaane kaa faisla kar liya
 Alka, the mother of three children, told this thing to her lover Alok and then together they hatched a conspiracy
 sabase pehle alka ne alok kii madad se ek puraani maaruti car kharidi or phir ghar ke bhaagane kaa puraa khaakaa taiyaar kar liya
 Under this, on 27 December, she got out of a car in the name of a stage show in Uran and went to Uran Na and reached Alok in Khargar
 yahaan se alok ne sanjay ko saath liya or phir donon ne sabase pehle alka ko vity railway stesan ke vatting room main choda or alka kii car lekar mumbai-pune old hai-ve par aa gaye
 After pushing the car into a deep ditch, he also threw Alka's mobile phone without a memory card
 taaki police or gharavaalon ko sadak haadase main alka kii maut kaa bharam ho jaae
 After pushing the husband's accusation on the husband into the ditch, Alok reached VT near Alka
 donon pehle bas se pune pahunche or phir vahaan se bangalore, kyonki alok vahiin kaam karata tha
 On the other hand, after seeing the news of Alka's disappearance on TV, both of them decided to leave Bangalore and came to Chennai
 lekin tab tak police alok ke dost sanjay sonkar ke jariye donon kaa pataa laga chuki thi
 Police arrested both of them by raiding them in Chennai
 police kii giraft main aane ke baad alka ne apane pati par jyaadati ke iljaam lagane shuru kar die, lekin donon kii khaufnak sajeesh or donon dost sanjay sonkar samet police ke shikanje main pahunch chuke the
