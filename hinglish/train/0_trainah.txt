 The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has sought a clarification from Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Congress President Sonia Gandhi in the matter following the Income Tax Tribunal's report in the Bofors scam

 Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party's national general secretary and chief spokesperson, told reporters that Quattrocchi was very close to the Gandhi family, and it was in this proximity that the Congress government shielded him from every legal trap
 pradhanmantri manmohan singh or sonia gandhi ko is maamle par apni safai deni chahie
 Prasad said the attitude of the United Progressive Alliance government is to weaken the case first and then to close the case with the court by pretending not to have evidence
 demand 
 unhone kaha ki iskar nyaayaadhikaran kii report se sabit hua he ki kwatrochi boforce kharid saude main dalal tha or use karodon rupee kii rishwat di gai thi
 He said that the case needs to be reopened on the basis of the tribunal's report
 prasad ne kaha ki isaki jaanch esaiti dwaara honi chahie
 Prasad said that Quattrocchi escaped or was allowed to flee the country in 1993 to avoid arrest and in 1998 when the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government came to power, a charge sheet was filed against Quattrocchi for the first time
 kwatrochi ke khilaaf november 1999 main giraftaar warrant jari hua
 He said that the bank account of Quattrocchi in England, which was banned by the NDA government, was withdrawn during the tenure of the UPA government
 unhone kaha ki jab congress ke hansraj bharadwaj kanoon mantri the, tab bharat sarkaar ke ek adhikari bi datta england gaye or unhone british sarkaar se kaha ki kwatrochi ke khilaaf bharat main koi maamla lambit nahin he
 He said that in September 2009, the central government asked the Supreme Court to withdraw the case against Quattrocchi
 prasad ne kaha ki kwatrochi ko bachaane ke liye kendriya jaanch beuro (sibiai) ne maamle ko band karne ke liye apni antim report nyaayalay ko saunpi he

 This committee is the right platform to test the government auditor's report
 sutron ne kaha, ‘pradhanmantri vaidhanik sanstha niyantrak evam mahalekha pareekshak kii aalochana nahin kar rahe the
 He was only reporting the report's flaw
 ’unhone kaha ki auditor kii report ko koi bhi chunauti de saktaa he
 Sources said the Prime Minister respects the statutory body but only wants it to ensure that its report is 'correct, balanced and fair'
 isi pariprekshya main pradhanmantri ke november 2010 main kaig kii 150veen jayanti par diye bhaashan kii ore dhyaan aakarshith kiya gaya jisamen unhone kaha tha ki hamaare loktantr ke ek ahm prahari ke naate is sanstha kii jimmedaari banati he ki vah jaanboojh kar kiye gayi galat kaaryon or anjaane main kii gayi galatiyon main antar kare
 Also review the perspective and circumstances of the decision process
 kendriya mantri or varisht congress netaa salmaan khurshid ne kaha ki unki party gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi kii ore se paidaa kii gayi atishyokti ko dhwast kar degi or bacchon main kuposhan ke oonche str evam amir or garib kii aamadani main asamanta kii pole khol kar rakh degi
 He said, 'we will destroy the exaggeration generated by Modi during the election campaign
 gujarat ke mukhyamantri ne apni chhavi kuch is tarah kii banaayi he jisase aisa lagata he ki vah samaveshi aarthik vruddhi ke suurama hai
 Khurshid said, "we will expose their claims by raising difficult questions related to the issues of malnutrition among children and inequality in income of rich and poor
" ’kendriya mantri ne kaha ki bal kuposhan or amir-garib kii aamadani main asamanta rashtravyapee mudde ho sakate hai lekin aisa kyon he ki satat vikaas ke bade daavon ke baavjood gujarat main ye samasyaayein bade paimaane par maujuud hai
 Ajit Pawar, accused of corruption of 95,000 crores, is picked up from a camp overnight and brought before the Governor
 unhen devendra fadanvis ke saath shapath dilaai jaati he
 The Devendra Fadnavis, who raised his political identity by raising the Rs 70,000 crore irrigation department scam, was making the same person as Deputy Chief Minister
 pichley saal hi unki sarkaar ke anti karpshan beuro ne hoicourt main halafanama dekar ajit pavaar ko mukhya aaropee bataaya tha
 That is, nothing special happened in this matter in 5 years of the first term
 ek talwaar lataka kar rakhi gai taaki ajit pavaar bure vakt main kaam aa saken
 On August 22, on the orders of Bombay High Court, the Crime Branch of Mumbai Police registered a case of embezzlement of 25000 crores
 isamen 70 log aaropee banaae gaye jinamein se ek ajit pavaar bhi the
 Subsequently, the ED Extradition Directorate also conducted raids
 yah centre kii agency he
 You tell me that the accused will be welcomed by the Prime Minister, the Home Minister will congratulate him and now the ED will dare to put his hand on it
 yaa phir idi se bachaane kii guarantee ke naam par hi ajit pavaar ko up mukhyamantri banaaya gaya he? congress kii sarkaar main hota to bijepi kahati ki congress ne 95000 karod lekar up mukhyamantri kaa pad bech diya
 BJP has a government
 bijepi jo karti he wo acha hi karti he
 It is for the first time in the history of India that the Prime Minister of the country has congratulated himself for becoming the Deputy Chief Minister by putting the name of the accused of the 95,000 crore scam
 congress sarkaar ke ghotaalon ke khilaaf chunaav ladakar aae modi 95,000 karod ke bhrashtachar ke aaropee kaa swaagat kar rahe hai
 Home Minister Amit Shah is congratulating
 media ke pratrakaar ise master stroke bataa rahe hai
 After calling the NCP a Naturally Corrupt Party, the Prime Minister, who specializes in the art of forming a government by breaking its mlas with 'honesty', can tell that when the entire party was called 'naturally Corrupt', where did a dozen mlas from that party come out honest? The NCP helped BJP during the trust vote in 2015
 vishwaas mat ke dauraan shiv sena mat vibhaajan chaahati thi lekin spikar ne dhvanimat se paas kar diya
 Shiv Sena was not openly saying its vote and BJP did not want to take risk
 isliye ensipi kii madad leni padi
 The result was that nothing special happened in the irrigation scam case for three years
 november 2018 main bambe hoicourt ke nagpur bench main sirf halafanama daayar kiya gaya
 In the future, Pawar was going to be useful, so the investigation continued in the name of investigation
 aarope bijepi ne lagaaya tha
 bjp's responsibility was to prove that
 ajit pavaar ko sazaa dilaati,lekin ab to ajit pavaar up mukhyamantri hai
 In Jharkhand too, BJP has given ticket to Bhanupratap Shahi
 in par 130 karod ke dawa ghotaale kaa trial chal rahaa he
 The ED and CBI have filed a charge sheet
 jab pradhanmantri raily karne jaaenge to manch par dawa ghotaale kaa aaropee bhanupratap shahi hoga or aise ghotaale ko ujagar karne vaale saryu raay manch se utaar die gaye honge
 His ticket has been cut
 telegu desham party ke rajya sabha saansad vaai es choudhary apni sadsyta chhod bijepi main shaamil ho gaye
 ED and CBI were also raided against Chaudhary
 sibiai ne choudhary ko 364 karod ke bank frad ke maamle main saman jari kiya tha
 In April 2019, ED had attached Chaudhary's assets in 315 crore money laundering and bank fraud case
 loksabhaa chunaav ke baad choudhary raashtra nirmaan ke liye bijepi main shaamil ho gaye
 Till now, accused of embezzlement cases of 150 crores or 350 crores were joining BJP, but this is the first time that the accused of 95,000 crores cases has become Deputy Chief Minister in BJP government
 shapath dilaai gai he
 At times, it seems that ED raids are not to wipe out black money but to lay hands on them
 varna chaape ke baad aise logon ko bijepi apni party or sarkaar main kyon leti
 There are many people on Maharashtra who are more knowledgeable than me
 aap unka likhaa padhein
 i neither can nor should write on every subject
 kisi ne yah nahin kaha ki un teen companiyon ke bare main vistaar se kyon nahin likhte hai jinhone bijepi ko 20 karod kaa chanda diya he or centre sarkaar un companiyon par aatanki funding ke maamle main jaanch kar rahi he
 Nobody said why are they silent on the electoral fund? Nitin Sethi has told in six episodes with documents how the Finance Ministry falsely got the bond passed by Parliament and now the big game of white money is going on through it
 maharashtra main aniatikta kii raajnneeti ho rahi he
 Everyone's face is exposed
 aniatikta kaa bhandar vipaksh ke kheme main bhi he
 There is also gross immorality in the ideological alliance
 lekin bijepi ne ajit pavaar ko up mukhyamantri banaakar chaal chal di he
 There is nothing more than power for him
 agar koi bhrashtachari he, luteraa he to wo mukhyamantri he, upmukhyamantri he
 We expect the public good from such politicians
 sachmuch janata bholi he
 May make the accused of 95000 crores scam BJP Deputy Chief Minister
 isse pataa chalata he ki yah daur usee kaa he

 in It can be said ironically that no matter how native the world of Hindustani classical music has been, it has been said and written mostly in English
 aksar nirakshar yaa kam padhe-likhe sangeet ke purodha-purushon kii jivaniyaan to angreji main likhi hi gai hai, sangeet kaa itihaas or duusari jaankariyaan dene vaali kitaaben bhi zyaadaatar angreji main hi likhi gai hai
 That is, English books have done away with the classical music which was already away from ordinary people
 shastreey sangeet ke vividh pahnon ko hindi jaisi bhashaa main likhakar aam logon ko shastreey sangeet ke vividh pahnon se jodne kaa kaam kiya ja saktaa tha par vah nahin hua
 This is the reason why the music is still limited to the elite
 is dukhad sthiti ke bich raahat kii baat he ki ginati ke hi sahi, kuch log hindi main bhi is vidha par lagaataar likh rahe hai
 Vijay Shankar Mishra is among those few people
 unke saath suvidha yah he ki ve khud tabalavadak hai or barason se bacchon ko tabalaa sikhaane kaa kaam kar rahe hai
 He gradually expanded his world with tabla and started contemplating and writing on these three parts of singing, playing, dancing and music
 sangeet ke alag-alag muddon par shodh kar unhone is bare main lagaataar likhaa he
 Now this book has come in that order
 sangeet ke vidhyaarthiyon, sangitsudhiyon ke liye to yah mahatv kii he hi, saamaanya log bhi chahen to ise padhakar apane andar sur, taal or lay kii samaj paidaa kar sakate hai
 Readers of this book can learn many things besides becoming familiar with many styles of singing, playing and dancing
 masalan, alag-alag gharaanon kii visheshtaayen, kai saajon kaa parichay, shastreey sangeet ke prachaar-prasar main radio-tivi kii bhoomika, beesvin sadi ke sangeet kaa itihaas, filmon main shastreey sangitagnon kaa yogadan aadi-aadi
 Taal, tabla and pakhavaj are also discussed in detail in the book
 bacchon ko anivaary sangeet shiksha dene ke himachati mishra is pustak main unhen sikhaane kii alag or nai paddati kii maang karte dikhaai dete hai
 Mishra, who feels the need for new restrictions in place of traditional restrictions for children, also appears to talk about resorting to film songs
 paramparawaadi sangeetkaar unki is baat se shaayad sahamat na hon
 Even though this book does not present a proper history of Hindustani classical music, it definitely gives information about all its things
 tabalaa, pakhaawaj, tanpura, ghunghru, shehanai, bansuri, dhrupad, dhamaar, thumari, kathak, bharatnatyam, manipuri aadi ke bare main jaanane ko utsuk pathak isse labhanvit ho sakate hai or kai sangeetkaaron ke bare main bhi jaankaree paa sakate hai
 Yes, there are three chapters of the book which are not for the general readers
 sangeet ke gahan-gambhir jaankaar yaa vidhyaarthee hi inhen pard or pachaa sakate hai
 'sangeet aur versa', 'sangeet Ratnakar ka Taal' chapter and 'taal in medieval texts' are similar texts
 ye adhyay sahaj-saral dhang se likhi gai is pustak ko rasbhang kii sthiti main daalane kaa kaam karte prathit hote hai
 a sensational incident has taken place with a loving couple sitting in Naya Raipur amid high alert in view of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Rajyotsav
 yahaan kuch badmaashon ne premi ko goli maarane ke baad premika ke saath gangrape kii vaardaat ko anjaam diya
 Police is investigating the matter by registering a case

 Then some chaotic elements reached there

 On protesting, the miscreants shot the boy to death
 iske baad badmaashon ne pistal kii nonk par ladki ke saath gangerap kii vaardaat ko anjaam dekar vahaan se faraar ho gaye
 The girl was roaming there in a bad condition
 tabhi ek shaks kii najar us par padi
 He went near and saw that a corpse was also lying there
 usne turant police ko phone karke soochna di
 According to Additional SP OP Sharma, as soon as the information was received, the police team reached the spot
 maukey par bear or sharaab kii bottlen bhi mili hai
 The deceased's name is Yuvraj Chauhan, who was a resident of WRS Colony

 haryana main mantrimandal kaa gathanmanohar cabinet main kul 10 mantri baneharyana main sarkaar gathan ke 19 din ke baad aakhirkaar manohar laal khatter cabinet gathan ho gaya he
 The first cabinet expansion of the BJP and JJP government took place on Thursday, with 10 ministers sworn in
 bijepi ke cote se 8, jejepi ke cote se ek or ek nirdaleey vidhayak ko mantri banaaya gaya
 But Gopal Kanda, the first Haryana Lokhit Party MLA to support BJP after the election results, could not find a place in the cabinet
 haryana main is baar cabinet puri tarah se badal gai he
 In the cabinet expansion, 6 mlas have been made cabinet ministers and 4 mlas as ministers of state
 manohar laal sarkaar main cabinet mantri ke taur par anil vij, kanvarpal gurjar, moolchand sharma, jepi dalal, banavaari laal or ranjit singh chautaala ko jagah mili he
 At the same time, while Om Prakash Yadav, Kamlesh Dhandha, Anoop Dhanak and Sandeep Singh have been awarded the posts of Minister of State
 bataa den ki 24 oktober ko haryana vidhansabha chunaav ke nattejey aae to bijepi bahumat ke aankade se dur thi
 In such a situation, Gopal Kanda, who won the election from Haryana Lokhit Party from Sirsa seat, openly announced his support to the BJP
 iske baad doosar din bijepi ke bade netaaon se dilli main mulaakaat kii thi
 Gopal Kanda said while talking to Aaj Tak, 'we are giving unconditional support
 ham chaahate hai ki pradesh main jo acchhee sarkaar chal rahi thi, wo chale
 Me and my family have been associated with RSS since the beginning
 ham pradhanmantri narendra modi se prabhavit hai
 Along with Gopal Kanda, Independent MLA Ranjit Singh Chautalane also announced his support for the BJP
 ye donon netaa ek saath ek chartd plane se dilli aae the or bijepi ke kaaryakari adhyaksh jepi nadda se mulaakaat kii thi
 On Thursday, when the cabinet of the Haryana government was being formed, Ranjit Singh Chautala was given the position of cabinet minister, but Gopal Kanda has been ignored

 aise main jab gopal kanda ne bijepi ko samarthan dene kaa elaan kiya to bijepi netaaon se lekar vipaksh tak ne sawaal khadey kar die the
 Senior BJP leader and former Union Minister Uma Bharatin had tweeted, saying that Gopal Kanda is the same person because of which a girl also committed suicide and this person is out on bail
 gopal kanda bekasoor he yaa apradhi, yah to kanoon saakshyon ke aadhaar par tay karegaa
 But winning her election does not acquit her of crimes
 chunaav jeetne ke bahut saare factor hote hai
 He had said that i will request BJP not to forget our moral establishment
 haryana main hamaari sarkaar jarur bane, lekin yah tay kariye ki jaise bijepi ke kaaryakarta saaf-suthri jindagi ke hote hai, hamaare saath vaise hi log hon
 Congress leader Randeep Surjewala also surrounded the BJP on the issue of Gopal Kanda
 unhone kaha tha ki bijepi usee gopal kanda se samarthan le rahi he, jise congress sarkaar ne na sirf sarkaar se baahar kaa rasta dikhaaya tha
 a case is registered against Kanda
 lekin aaj wo pavitra ho gaye hai
 In such a situation, it seems that the BJP has avoided making Gopal Kanda a minister due to all these allegations

 The film stars Parineeti Chopra, Aditya Roy Kapur, Anupam Kher and Karan Wahi in the lead roles
 film ke nirdeshak hai habib faijal
 This is Habib's second film after 'ishqzaade'
 film main pariniti chopra ke kirdaar kaa naam he gulrej kaadir, unke pita bane hai anupam kher
 Both of them live in Hyderabad and Parineeti's father is very upset because her daughter Gulrej is not getting married
 har ladkaa unase dahej main badi rakam kii maang karata he or phir vah yah faisla lete hai ki dahej ke laalchiyon ko vah sabak sikhayenge
 After this, the hunt begins and hunt becomes Tariq Hydari, who runs the famous restaurant in Lucknow, but you will have to watch the film to know whether Gulrez will have his intentions
 to is 'daavat-e-ishk' ko chakhne ke baad hi aapako pataa chalegaa ki swaad kaisaa he
 i have tasted it and now i will tell you how it tastes
 yani baat film kii khoobiyon or khaamiyon kii
 Seeing the promos, there was a need to watch this film with logic, but some scenes in the story spoiled my appearance
 masalan anupam kher kaa kirdaar, film main vah ek laachaar pita bane hai, jo dare sahame najar aate hai par saath hi vah kanoon ke rakhwalon ke saath kaam bhi karte hai
 His change of heart in the film does not come off the throat as a law breaker
 saath hi climex or tarik ke kirdaar ke saath bhi kuch aisa hi hota he, jo bhale hi film ke liye jaruri ho par tark ke saath dikhaanaa jaruri tha
 At the same time, the carving which was seen in Habib Faisal's directorial 'ishqzaade' saw a slight decrease in Dawat-e Ishq
 yahaan bollywood ke formula kii ore nirdeshak thodaa jhukate najar aae
 The screenplay of the film seems loose at times
 acchhee baat yah rahi ki aditya anupam or pariniti apane-apane abhinay se film ko sambhalate dikhte hai
 i liked Aditya's work, especially his getup

 20-21 sitambar ko chand par ho jaaegi raatphir, vikram se sampark naammumkin hogabhartiya antariksh agency isro (indian Space Research Organisation - ISRO) ke vaigyanik ab bhi apane duusare moon mishan chandrayan-2 (chandrayaan-2) ke vikram lander se sampark saadhane main lage hai
 However, ISRO tweeted that thanks to all of you for standing with us
 ham duniya bhar main bharatiyon kii aashaaon or sapanom se prerit hokar aage badhate rahenge
 That is, people are also saying about this message that now ISRO scientists are moving towards the next mission
 lekin chandrayan-2 mishan par bhi najar rakhenge
 However, now the expectation of contact with Vikram Lander is over
 kyonki chand par raat hone main kareeb 3 ghante hi bache hai
 Thank you for standing by us
 We will continue to keep going forward — propelled by the hopes and dreams of Indians across the world!pic

 com / vpgewcwvia— ISRO (@isro)september 17, 20197 sitambar ko tadake 1
 Around 50 o'clock the Vikram lander fell on the south pole of the moon
 jis samay chandrayan-2 kaa vikram lander chand par gira, us samay vahaan subah thi
 That is, the sunlight started falling on the moon
 chand kaa puraa din yani suraj kii roshni vaala puraa samay prithvi ke 14 dinon ke baraabar hota he
 That is, it will be night on the moon on 20 or 21 September
 14 din kaam karne kaa mishan lekar gaye vikram lander or pragyan rover ke mishan kaa time puraa ho jayega
 Today is 18 September, that is, about 3 hours before the night of 20-21 September on the moon
 yani, chand par shaam ho chuki he
 When the date of September 20 and 21 is in our calendar, then the darkness of night will be over the moon
 nasa ne bhi mana- chand par ho chuki he shaam, ab vikram lander se sampark mushkil16 sitambar ko Aajtak
 Project Scientist Noa of the US space agency nasa's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO), speaking to In
 i
 Petro had told that it was dusk on the moon
 hamaara LRO vikram lander kii tasviren to legaa, lekin is baat kii guarantee nahin he ki tasviren spasht aaengi
 Because, in the evening the sunlight is less and in such a situation it will be a challenging task to take clear pictures of anything on the surface of the moon
 lekin jo bhi tasviren aaengi, unhen ham bhartiya antariksh agency isro se saajha karenge
 The meaning of the evening means that the contact with Vikram Lander is very low, if by 20-21 September somehow scientists of ISRO and other agencies around the world succeeded in contacting Vikram Lander, well, otherwise it can be assumed That contacting Vikram again would be nothing short of a miracle
 kyonki, chand par raat shuru ho jaaegi, jo prithvi ke 14 dinon ke baraabar hogi
 There will be no sunlight in the part of the moon where Vikram Lander is
 taapmaana ghatakar mines 183 degree celsius tak ja saktaa he
 It is difficult to say whether the electronic parts of Vikram Lander will be able to survive themselves at this temperature
 isliye vikram lander se sampark nahin ho paaegaa
 nasa's Three Deep Space Network Antennas Sending Message to vikramamerican Space Agency NASA (NASA) is also constantly trying to contact the three centers of its Deep Space Network with Chandrayaan-2's orbiter and lander
 ye teen centres hai - spain kaa madrid, america ke california main goldstone or australia kaa canberra
 The powerful antenna installed at these three places is able to contact Chandrayaan-2's orbiter, but no response is being received to the messages being sent to Vikram Lander
 jabaki, chandrayan-2 kaa orbitor use milane vaale sandeshon kaa jawaab de rahaa he

 Narendra Modi has said in an interview that Priyanka Gandhi Vadra is like his daughter, so i am not responding to his political attacks
 bhartiya samskruti kaa hawala dete hue modi bole ki hamaare yahaan betiyon par hamale nahin kiye jate
 But Modi's saying could not reach the people because the Doordarshan, in which this interview was said, was edited
 angreji akhbaar times of india ke mutabik doordarshan ne modi kaa intervyuu record karne ke do din baad tak nahin dikhaaya
 Then suddenly it was broadcast without any prior notice
 itnaa hi nahin intervyuu ke kai hisse bhi sampadit kar die gaye
 This was also a comment by Priyanka Gandhi among them
 modi ne kaha tha sonia or rahul gandhi mere raajnneetik pratidwandvi hai
 That is why i mention them
 magar priyanka gandhi ke saath aisa nahin he
 Significantly, this interview of Narendra Modi is also not available on Doordarshan's website
 is intervyuu ke dauraan hi modi ne kaha tha ki gujarat doordarshan ko bada rajasav detaa he, phir bhi unhen is news channel par aghoshit rup se bain kiya jaataa rahaa
 Without a promo teaser, the interview was conducted by the bjp's PM candidate Narendra Modi on DD News on April 27 at 9 pm
 30 baje prasaarit kiya gaya
 It was recorded on the morning of 26 April for Doordarshan's 'khas Mulaqat' program
 intervyuu ko prasaarit karne se pehle kisi bhi tarah kaa promo yaa tiger nahin chalaaya gaya
 Modi supporters wanted to know about this interview via Twitter as to why it is delayed or under pressure from the Ministry of Information
 is intervyuu main modi ne yah bhi kaha tha ki unke bare main gujarat doordarshan main kabhi khabar nahin aati or unka blike out kiya gaya he
 So he was surprised to know about this interview
 raajnneetik vivaad se bachanaa chahta tha didi newjasutron ne akhbaar ko bataaya ki dedh ghante ke is intervyuu ko jabardast tareeke se sampadit kiya gaya
 It was thought in Doordarshan that this would lead to political controversy
 prasar bharti ke mukhiya jawahar sarkaar se jab is babat poocha gaya to unhone kaha ki yah intervyuu pehle hi dikhaa diya janaa chahie tha
 As soon as it came to my notice, i agreed to take it
 lekin unhone intervyuu ke sampadit hisson kii koi jaankaree hone se inkaar kar diya

 This was followed by a partnership of over 200 runs for the fifth wicket only once, before the partnership of Eoin Morgan and Ravi Bopara
 australia ke maaikel clark or andrew symonds 7 disambar, 2005 ko newjiland ke khilaaf wellington main ajahar or jadeja kaa record todane ke kareeb pahunch gaye the, or in donon ne paanchaven wicket ke liye 220 ran jod liye the, lekin symonds aakhri over kii chauthi gend par out ho gaye
 The partnership of Eoin Morgan and Ravi Bopara is the new record for the fifth wicket in one-day international cricket
 morgan ne naabad 124 or bopaara ne naabad 101 ran banaae, jisase england is ekmaatr van-de match main 42 genden shesh rahete chah wicket se jeet darj karne main safal rahaa
 The comments eon morgan ne vijayi chakka jadkar england ko jeet dilaai or iske saath hi paanchaven wicket ke liye saajhedaari kaa nayaa record bhi ban gaya
 Earlier the record was in the name of Mohammad Azharuddin and Ajay Jadeja, who added 223 runs for the fifth wicket against Sri Lanka on August 17, 1997 in Colombo
 ajaharuddin or jadeja, donon ne us match main shatak jamaaye the, lekin phir bhi bharat do ran ke kareebi antar se match haar gaya tha
 By the way, Azharuddin and Jadeja broke their record of 159 against Australia's Michael Bevan and Ricky Ponting in Melbourne in January 1996 against Sri Lanka
 iske baad eon morgan or ravi bopaara kii saajhedaari se pehle, keval ek baar paanchaven wicket ke liye 200 ran se adhik kii saajhedaari nibhaai gai

 But got out panchayat ajtak himachal pradesh ke pehle satr main varisht congress netaa randeep singh surajevaala or bijepi saansad anuraag thakur ne shirkat kii
 The session was moderated by India Today Managing Editor Rahul Kanwal
 is satr ke dauraan rajya main satta paane kii daud: bijepi or congress ke bich koun zyada feet he
 During the talks of the two leaders, the issue was most important that this time the fight in the state elections is directly between the BJP and the ruling Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh
 congress netaa kaa daawa he ki aagaamee chunaavon main bijepi ke liye piem modi kaa cheharaa koi phayda nahin dilaaegaa
 The same Thakur claims that the Congress did not field Rahul Gandhi for campaigning in the state
 lihaaja rajya ke chunavi samar main is baar ladaai sidhe bijepi or mukhyamantri virbhadra singh ke bich dekhne ko milegi
 Jumla Babu becomes PM Modi? In the beginning of this session, Congress leader Surjewala said that the BJP government has only taken the support of Jumal
 ek ke baad ek jumale suna kar pradhanmantri narendra modi ab desh main jumala babu ban kar rah gaye hai
 At the same time, Agurag Thakur said that senior Congress leaders have a habit of lying
 thakur ne kaha ki bijepi sarkaar main desh kii janata ko vah sabakuch diya gaya jo congress sarkaron ne beete 70 saal tak nahin diya
 Counting the achievements of the BJP government in the state, Thakur said that the Congress does not have the correct figures of development in the state
 kendra sarkaar ne rajya ke prati apni puri jimmedaari nibhaai he
 Corruption is becoming a big electoral issue? Surjewala accused the BJP government at the Center of not investigating into the Vyapam scam, in response to which Anurag said that the Modi government is moving towards making the country corruption free
 thakur ne kaha ki modi sarkaar ne 500 rupee or 1000 rupee kii note band kar kaledhan par lagaam lagane ke liye bada faisla kiya he
 Also read: Rahul's coronation after Himachal elections, because of this, a few days after the event, Rahul Kanwal asked what the former leaders wanted to say on the corruption done by Sukhram
 surajevaala ne kaha ki piem modi ne daawa kiya tha ki vah videsh main padaa kalaadhan waapas lekar aaenge
 So, has black money returned to any one account after three years? Speaking on the corruption charges leveled against Congress Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh in the state, Surjewala said that the Modi government made a fake case and put Redbird's house red at a time when the wedding program was going on in his house
 lekin uske baad kendra sarkaar ko mukhyamantri ke khilaaf kuch nahin mila
 False accusations against BJP CM candidate, Anurag Thakur said on corruption charges leveled against himself and BJP Chief Minister candidate Dhumal that there are no cases against him
 surajevaala ne kaha ki jab anuraag thakur or unke pita par stadium kii jameen par kabja karne kaa aarope laga or yah aarope court main he
 The matter is currently pending before the Supreme Court
 anuraag thakur ne kaha ki sabhi aarope bebuniyaad hai
 Thakur said that he has done four times more tourism in the state
 stadium or hotel ke liye free main di gai jameenthakur ne kaha ki beete teen saal tak vah kendra se kai bade projects lekar aae lekin rajya main congress sarkaar ne kabhi in projects ke liye jameen nahin di
 Thakur said that he wanted to bring AIIMS in the state but the Congress government is hanging it
 rahul kanwal ne poocha ki kya dharmashala main cricket bananaa galat tha? isapar surajevaala ne kaha ki kisi sarkari jameen ko privet party ko dene se pehle market rate ke mutabik lij tay kiya janaa chahie
 But the BJP Chief Minister in the state fixed the lease for just one rupee
 beti kii shaadi or mukhyamantri ke ghar sibiai chhapaakhir virbhadra singh ke ghar shaadi ke maukey par kyon sibiai kii red daali gai? isapar thakur ne poocha ki kya sibiai mahaj pradhanmantri ke nirdesh par kaam karti he yaa phir vah ek sanstha he jo apana kaam karne ke liye swatantra he
 Thakur said that the CBI was not aware that Virbhadra Singh had a wedding
 is safai par surajevaala ne kaha ki beete teen saal ke dauraan congress ke kisi netaa ko nahin choda gaya
 At the same time, Virbhadra Singh was humiliated by the Modi government on the day when the daughter's wedding was going on in her house
 lekin thakur ne kaha ki mukhyamantri virbhadra singh ke beti kii shaadi sankatmochan mandir main chal rahi thi or sibiai chapa unke ghar par padaa tha
 CBI BJP worker in Modi government? Surjewala said that it was an allegation against Congress that CBI was a parrot in his government
 lekin modi sarkaar ke vakt to sibiai bijepi kaaryakarta ban chuki he
 On this charge, Thakur said that organizations like CBI and ED do their work within their jurisdiction
 bijepi sarkaar ne kisi tarah se in sansthaaon ke kaamkaaj main kabhi raajnneetik hastkshep nahin kiya he
 However, Thakur said that the Modi government has given these institutions full opportunity to work independently to make the country corruption free
 kya congress mukt ho rahaa he desh?anuraag thakur ne kaha ki ek-ek kar sabhi rajyon se congress saaf ho rahi he
 Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi were tried in the last elections but failed badly
 thakur ke mutabik congress ek baar phir rahul gandhi ko ripacaging ke baad laa rahi he or yah unhen satta main waapas laane main ek baar phir fail ho jayega
 In response, Surjewala said that people are understanding about Rahul Gandhi
 lihaaja jab rahul gandhi kehete hai ki achche din aane vaale hai modi ji jane vaale hai tab log ise pasand karte hai
 Taking a dig at Rahul Gandhi, Anurag Thakur said that Rahul Gandhi did not campaign for elections in the state
 aakhir kyon rahul himachal se dur rah rahe hai
 Surjewala said that Modi ji is fully aware that this time his face will not be sold in the state, so he is putting forward the face of former Chief Minister Dhumal ji
 yuva ko netritv koun de rahaa he?rajya main yuvaaon ko netritv dene ke naam par congress ke paas behad varisht netaa he vahiin bijepi ne yuvaaon ko hameshaa mauka diya he
 To this, Surjewala said that leadership as well as experience matters for the Congress
 modi ji ke liye varisht netaaon kaa koi sammaan nahin he or bijepi ke andar vah experience ko baahar kaa rasta dikhaa chuke hai

 dandakaarany SZC ne sukama main congressi netaaon par hamale kii jimmedaari le lee he
 a press note in this regard has been issued by Gudsa Usendi on behalf of the organization
 press note main naksaliyon ne kaha, hamaare nishane par bijepi or congress donon hi partiyaan hai
 Taking responsibility for the Naxalite attack in Chhattisgarh, Dandakaranya Committee has written a letter to the media
 dandakaarany vishesh jonal cameti ke pravaktaa gudsa usendi kaa kahana he ki naksaliyon ne salwa judum kaa badla liya he
 It has been clearly written in Chitti that our target was mainly Mahendra Karma
 wo saamanti parivaar ke the, haalanki apane ko adivaasiyon kaa netaa bataate the
 He had supported the Salwa Judum, which caused massive destruction in the Bastar region
 chitti main likhaa gaya he ki raman sarkaar se unke behatar rishte the
 He was also called as the sixteenth minister of Raman Singh
 nandkumar bhi naksaliyon ke virdohi the, isiilie unki hatya kii gai
 In the letter, Naxalites have also termed VC Shukla as anti-naxalites
 saath hi kaha he ki is hamale main jo nirdosh log maare gaye uskaa unhen khed he
 While the Naxalite organization claimed responsibility for the attack, the tribal leader Mahendra Karma's family also threatened to leave the village within a week
 aise main, rajya sarkaar ne karma ke parivaar ko jed plus suraksha or nandkumar patel ke parivaar ko jed suraksha dene kaa nirnay liya he
 Who was Mahendra Karma and why he became a Naxalite, the enemy of his life Mahendra Karma was called Tiger of Bastar
 unhone 2005 main salwa judum abhiyaan shuru kiya tha
 Salwa Judum, the campaign to answer the Naxalites
 salwa judum ke jariye mahendra karma ne adivaasiyon ko naksaliyon se ladane kii takat di thi
 Under the Salwa Judum, common people were given weapons and trained to deal with Naxalite terrorists
 mahendra karma ke salwa judum abhiyaan kii aalochana bhi khub hui
 People advocating the interests of Naxalites had termed it as a second type of terrorism, but the BJP government of Chhattisgarh adopted this formula of Mahendra Karma and created a special police force
 salwa judum ke tahat saikadon naksali maare gaye the
 In this way Mahendra Karma became the enemy number one of the Naxalites
 mahendra karma par chaar baar naksali hamalaa hua tha, lekin har baar unhone maut ko maat de di thi, lekin paanchaven hamale ke vakt kismat ne saath nahin diya or mahendra karma shahid ho gaye
 Along with Mahendra Karma, the power of the tribals, which was also their strong voice, became silent
 cheharaa or naam chhipate hai naksalidandakaarany jonal cameti ne logon ko virodh ke liye ikattha kiya he
 The committee is headed by Gudsa Usendi
 haalanki mukhiya kaa asli naam gudsa usendi nahin he
 People associated with Naxalites hide their real name and face
 bataaya gaya he ki logon ko majaburi main unka saath dena padataa he
 On the other hand, the cabinet secretary is going to meet on Tuesday on the Naxalite attack in Chhattisgarh
 isamen sabhi sambandhit vibhaagon ke pratinidhi maujuud rahenge
 At the same time, the state government will present a report on this Naxalite attack today

 team ne ramakrishna care aspataal kaa daura kiya or vahaan bhartee ghayal naksali netaaon or police javaanon se mulaakaat kii
 The team also questioned the injured leaders and jawans regarding the incident

 Relieving central employees and pensioners from dearness, the government announced a 7 percent increase in their dearness allowance (DA)

 yash chopra ne apane assistant se kaha tha ki ve parveen ko is bare main bataa den ki ve film kaa hissaa nahi hai or unhen meri taraf se sori bol den
 Parveen and Yash Chopra were confronted at Kashmir Airport by coincidence
 yash chopra bombai se srinagar pahunche the or parveen waapas mumbai ja rahi thim
 Parveen met Yash Chopra and said "yash you did what is better for the film, you are not doing anything bad with me so you don't have to ignore me
" bas tum par meri ek film udhaar rahi
 "smita had felt bad about this, so now it was the turn of Smita Patil
" iske liye yash chopra ne apane dost or cast main shaamil shashi kapur kii madad lee
 Shashi Kapoor accepted it with great difficulty
 baad main jab smita patil or yash chopra kii mulaakaat hui to smita ne yash se kaha tha- yashji aapane wo kiya jo aapako thik laga
 i just did not like the same thing, i would not mind if you spoke to me yourself
 shashi ne bolaa to mujhe bura laga
 Hearing this, Yash Chopra replied - You are right, but the man sometimes gets caught in such a shameful situation that he is unable to speak freely
 main bahut sharminda hum
 Talking about the film, it is still very much liked today
 bahut saare log to film ko amitabh bachchan kii real life se bhi jod kar dekhte hai
 Apart from Amitabh, Shashi, Rekha, Jaya, the film also starred Sanjeev Kumar, Kulbhushan Kharbanda, Deven Verma and Sushma Seth

 shivasena pramukh bal thakare ne party mukhpatr ‘saamana’ ke sampadakeey main nijee samachar channelon dwaara unke kharaab swasth kii khabaren dikhaae jane ke dhang kii aalochana kii he
 Thackeray, admitted to the Lilavati Hospital in Mumbai, wrote in an editorial that news channels were competing about his health-related news
 unhone likhaa, “ek channel ne kaha ki main ucch raktchaap se peedit hum, to duusare ne kaha ki mujhe nimna raktchaap he
 They wanted to get more information about my health, not about committed doctors engaged in my treatment
 ” shivasena pramukh ke anusaar samachar channel ‘tiarapy’ ke liye aisa karte hai
 He wrote that the channels want 'breaking news'

 ” unhone yah baat aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav main congress or rashtravaadi congress party ke bich siton ke bantwaare ko lekar kahi

 japan jaisaa desh bharat kii loksamskruti or kala ko bakhubi samajhate hue hamaare yahaan kii prasiddh madhubani chitrakala par apane yahaan sangrahalay kaa nirmaan kara saktaa he, lekin apane hi desh ne is kala ke pujaariyon par dhyaan dene main jaraa der laga di
 Well it is said that better late than never
 bihar kii is vishwaprasiddh lokkala ko aane vaali peedi ke liye sahejane kii garaj se rajya sarkaar ne ek santhaan kholane kii ghoshnaa kii, jise mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne bhavishya main vishvavidhyalay kaa swarup dene kaa elaan kiya he
 After painting with natural colors, the Bihar government's decision to open an institution can be considered a milestone in the direction of keeping folk art alive in this phase of change
 is kala ke maahir fankaar lambey samay se gumnami main ji rahe the or apni aane vaali pidiyon ko yah dharohar saunpane se kataraane lage the
 The people of Jitwarpur and Ranti villages of Madhubani, considered to be centers of this art, were troubled by neglect
 rajya ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne apni seva yatra ke dauraan kaha, ‘pehle yah kala mithila kshetra main thi
 After that, the family was confined to the village and came back
 yah kala kahin gum na ho jaae iske liye prachaar prasar or protsaahan ke liye rahika prakhand ke jitwarpur sthit saurath maidan main 10 acre main ek santhaan kholaa jayega
 It will later be given the shape of the university
 ’ japan main nigaata praant main tokamachi main madhubani chitrakala par ek sangrahalay kholaa gaya he jahaan saadhe aath sau se adhik mithila painting hai
 There is a large number of other collections
 varsh 1988 main mithila sangrahalay ne prasiddh kalakaar ganga devi ko avlokan ke liye bulaayaa
 Since then many artists have traveled there
 mithila kshetra main jis bheeshan akaal ke kaaran mithila chitrakala kaa kayakalp 1964 main hua vah ab protsaahan or vipanan ke paryaapt avasar ke abhaav main murjhaa si gayi he
 For many years, they have longed for the connoisseur of art
 bihar rajya maithili academy ke adhyaksh kamalakant jha ke anusaar mithila yaa madhubani kii chitrakala ek dharohar he
 In this age of information and communication, there is a need to preserve the heritage
 sabhi lok paaramparik madhyam ke mahatv ko jaanate hai
 Renaissance has come in all the arts
 aashaa he ki iskaa vikaas hoga or ise yathochit sammaan milegaa
 Gauri Mishra, an 80-year-old resident of Darbhanga who is a connoisseur of this art, says that the culture of Mithila is embedded in this painting
 chitrakala main janm se lekar mrityu tak har parampara ko nirupit kiya jaataa he
 The present generation does not know much about it
 kai varsh se adhyayan or anusandhan main lagi gauri mishra kahati hai ki is chitrakala ko madhubani nahin balki mithila chitrakala ke naam se pukaara janaa chahie
 Because it is not of Madhubani but of the land of Mithila
 is dharti ke bare main hi kahawat he ki uttar main giriraaj himalay, dakshin main gangadham, purab kosi, pashchim gandak or bich bahichhai balaan
 Hence Gauri, popularly known as Amma, says that Mithila painting is a popular name in place of Madhubani
 germany ke hidelburg ke maanavvigyaani dow
 Gauri Mishra, working with Erica Smith on this painting since 1973, regrets that all the research and documentary work done on the painting was destroyed in the flood
 santhaan kholane kii sarkaar kii ghoshnaa kaa swaagat karte hue vayovruddh visheshgy kahati hai, ‘yah itnaa aasaan nahin hoga
 Earlier, the outline of syllabus etc
 was prepared
 bihar ke tatkaaleen rajyapal mohammad shafi kuraishi ko prastaav diya gaya tha lekin yah faleebhoot nahin ho paaya
 'ihitashree Mishra, who is engaged in systematizing this historical and cultural heritage, says,' There is documentary evidence that Mithila or Madhubani painting is about three thousand years old
 lokgeeton or parampara ke anusaar iskaa samay kahi adhik purana bataaya jaataa he
 Experts of Mithila painting believe that its central theme has constantly changed over time
 ek samay tha jab ram, janaki, lakshmana, shrikrishna radha prasang, devi durga jaise puranic vishay chitrakaari ke centre bindu hua karte the
 Topics like environmental protection, village chaupal talks, total sanitation are also being reflected in the new era
 ihithashri maanati hai ki iske chatkh rang or lokapriyata fishan dizinron ko aakarshith to kar rahi he lekin mul bhaavana se samjhauta kiya ja rahaa
 Today, artists do not know that more than 10 thousand elements like fish, lotus, bamboo, Shiva Parvati, snake, were integral to Madhubani painting
 unka apana mahatv or sanket hota tha
 The subject of painting is undergoing constant change according to Ihtashree, a B
 Tech
 lokkala or vidwata kaa tatv kam hota ja rahaa he
 Now, professionalism is dominating in place of traditional colors and expressive expressions to earn money
 pen pencil kaa adhik prayog ho rahaa he jo madhubani painting kaa mul ang nahin he
 The biggest change has come from the use of Madhubani in apparel
 madhubani painting ke chaape vaale kurte, shawl, sari or chadar khub pasand kiye ja rahe hai, jisase kala kaa prasar hua he
 However, traditional painting is still seen in the walls of the houses
 badlaav ke daur main is chitrakala ke naye rup par bhi anusandhan jari he
 The National Institute of Design (NID) in Ahmedabad has trained blending in painting by training some artists and youth of Madhubani
 nitish kumaar kehete hai ki bihar saanskrithik viraasat kii khan he
 Madhubani painting here needs to be properly developed
 is chitrakala kii vishesh baat yah he ki yah samtamulak samaaj kaa sandesh prasaarit karti he, jisamen sabhi jati or samudaay kii mahilaayein chitra banaati he
 It is a living example of creative activity in which illiterate women also introduce excellent geometric calculations in their painting
 jitwarpur or aasapaas ke kuch kshetron main mithila painting main islamic samskruti kii bhi jhalak milti he
 Chief Minister Nitish Kumar himself visited artists at Ranti and Harijan hamlet in Jitwarpur
 madhubani or darbhanga ke alaava pashchim champaran, supaul, bhagalpur, saharsa, sitamarhi, begusarai, samastipur ke kuch hisson main is kala kaa adhik lokapriy swaroop dekha jaataa he
 Despite appearing in handcraft exhibitions and emporiums, Mithila painting artists are not able to come forward openly due to lack of good marketing system
 is kala kii shuruyaat ke bare main paraspar alag alag daawey saamne aate hai, lekin lok shruti or paramparaon ke anusaar veda or puraanon main bhi mithila kii chitrakaari kaa varnan miltaa he
 The art is said to have originated from the Teej festival, marriage ceremonies and auspicious occasions which are now reflected in costumes and robes
 ihithashri mishra abhi bangalore main maithilosmita naamak sanstha ke madhyam se pradarshaniyaan lagaati hai or vah is chitrakala ke bare main jaagrukta ke liye prayasarat hai
 His organization is in touch with artists in Rajepur, Simri, Jitwarpur, Rajnagar, Rasidpur of Mithila region and is engaged in refining his art
 is kala ko protsaahan dene main lagi mishra kahati hai, ‘main kalakaaron se kahati hum ki ve kritrim rangon kaa upyog nahin karen
 The use of emotion and expressive colors in painting is the soul of Mithila painting '
 ihithashri ke anusaar, ’vyavsaayeekaran kii daud or adhik sankhya main chitra banane ke kaaran mul bhav kam hote ja rahe hai
 Foreign people are also misled many times

 ' There was a political battle in Parliament for the second consecutive day today over the revelation of Justice Markandey Katju on the corruption in the judiciary
 centre sarkaar ne mangalvaar ko justise katju ke daavon ko sahi tehraate hue pichhali upie sarkaar par gambhir sawaal uthaae
 In the Rajya Sabha, Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said that in June 2006, the PMO had asked the Supreme Court judges' collegium to consider the name of the judge, which Katju has mentioned in his disclosure
 shuruyaat main jaj ke naam par collegium ke nahin raji hone par kanoon mantralay ne bhi is sambandh main note bheja tha
 The government has also recognized that there is a need to improve the process of appointment of judges in the country
 kanoon mantri ne kaha, 'jaj kii niyukti ke liye kade badlaav karne kii jarurat he
 For that, our government is seriously considering the formation of the National Judicial Commission
 'haalanki ravishankar prasad ke is bayaan par sadan main joardaar hua
 The Congress said that the conduct of judges cannot be debated in Parliament
 bhrashtachari ko banaaya gaya tha madras hai court kaa adishnal jajah katjusupreme court ke purv justise markandeya katju ne daawa kiya tha ki tamilnadu ke ek jila adaalat ke jaj par bhrashtachar ke gambhir aarope hone ke baavjood use madras hai court kaa adishnal jaj banaaya gaya
 Markandey Katju has also accused Manmohan Singh and his government of saving the corrupt judge
 unhone supreme court ke teen chif justise par bhi bhrashtachar ko lekar gambhir sawaal uthaae hai
 Katju said that Manmohan Singh allowed a corrupt man to remain the Additional Judge of the Madras High Court to save his government
 chif justise aarasi lahoti ne iske khilaaf aawaaj nahin uthaai or sarkaar kii baat ko maan liya
 After the political uproar over the revelations, on Tuesday, Justice Katju has asked 6 questions to former Supreme Court Justice RS Lahoti
 unhone ye sawaal apane blog main likhe
 
 
 1
 kya ye sach nahin he ki maine chennai se aapako patr likhakar jaankaree di thi ki madras hoicourt ke adishnal jaj ke khilaaf bhrashtachar ke gambhir maamle hai
 2
 justise lahoti, kya ye sach nahin he ki maine us jaj ke bare main ibi jaanch ke liye aapse sifarish kii thi?3
 Is it not true that you yourself called me and told me that my allegations were found true in the IB investigation? 4
 kya ye sach nahin he ki ibi report ke baad aap samet supreme court ke teen jajon kii baithak hui thi?5
 Justice Lahoti, is it not true that you wrote a letter to the Additional Judge to the Government of India for a one-year extension? 6
 ibi kii report main saaf ho gaya tha ki adishnal jaj bhrashtachar main lipt hai to phir unke ekstansion ke liye kyon sifarish kii gai? Actress Neha Dhupia believes her face and body are perfect for acting in a film like Angelina Jolie's 'lara Craft: Tom Rider'

 However, India is fundamentally strong, so we will overcome the crisis faster than others

 Bollywood actress Kriti Sanon has been silent for a long time over the controversy over the picture to which all the animal activists and social media activists have reacted sharply
 asal main kriti ne ek magazine ke liye photoshute karaayaa tha jiske becoground main ek bada sa jiraph prop ke taur par lataka hua tha
 If you have not seen this picture yet, then first see this picture
 Kriti could actually be taller than the giraffe? 😂 @kritisanon for @cosmoindia Aug 2018 
 Shot by: @andrewwoffinden Styling: @zunailimalik Hair: @aasifahmedofficial Makeup: @adrianjacobsofficiala post shared bykriti Sanon FC (@team
 kriti) onaug 7, 2018 at 6:48am pdtsusamwa ke berthde par 'garlfriend' kriti ne maangi ye special vikeb is tasviir par uthe vivaad ke bare main aapako bataate hai
 It was being said that the photoshoot for the magazine cover was done in Aynhoe Park
 yah park mrit jeevon ko prizerv karke unako stachu ke form main tabdeel karne ke liye janaa jaataa he
 So that the bodies of those animals can be kept for display or study
 log aisa bhi maanate hai ki kai baar jeevon ko jaanboojhkar aisa karne ke liye maar diya jaataa he
 PHOTOS: In the New Year calendar, from Kriti to Parineeti to the bold look, the actress has now reacted to the controversy and said, "it was a normal photoshoot that was done in a hotel in London
 decoration isi hotel ke wildlife jone main kii gai thi
 Everything visible behind is fake
 main khud ek animal lover hum
 "let us tell you that Kriti Sanon will soon be seen in the film Lukka Choochhi, Kalank and Housefull 2
 vaise to pati-patni ke bich kaa rishta vishwaas kii majboot door se bandhaa hota he
 But sometimes even some very trivial matters make a wife suspect her husband
 aage kuch vaise hi kaam yaa vyavhaar kii charchaa kii gai he
 
 
 1
 mobile lekar zyada vakt bitanakoi shaks agar mobile par zyada baaten karata he yaa Whatsapp aadi ko lekar zyada active rahata he, to aise main patni ko shaq hone kii ashanka bad jaati he
 Some women even believe that when their husbands spend more time quietly on mobile, they suspect it, even if they are playing candy crush
 2
 Even after the end of duty, late home attendants, even after finishing their duties, they may come under suspicion
 aise main patni ko shaq hota he ki aakhir janaab kahaan se aa rahe hai
 3
 oficial trip par jane kii baedgar koi shaks yah kahata he ki use oficial trip par shahar se baahar janaa he, to vah jane-anjaane apni patni main man main shaq-subahaa ke beej bo rahaa hota he
 In such a situation, women often insist on walking with their husbands
 4
 Even after caring more, many times when people suddenly start talking sweeter than their wife or taking more care, their wife's brain starts ringing
 ve sochati hai ki aakhir majara kya he, kahin kuch gadabad to nahin?5
 Saja-sanvarkar going out
 If Patidev is very well groomed before he steps out of the house alone, makes full use of dio-perfume, then his ardhangini may be in doubt
 darasal, shaq cheez hi aisi he
 Don't know who, when and where to take them
 kehete hai na ki shaq kaa ilaaj to hakim lukaman ke paas bhi nahin tha

 rishte hamaare jivan main bahut ahmiyat rakhte hai
 Relationships make us realize that we are not alone
 rishton ke prati hamaara daayitv hota he ki ham use thik tarah se nibhaaen
 It has been seen many times that misunderstandings make it difficult to handle relationships and relationships are broken
 magar ye hameshaa jaruri nahin ki toote hue rishte dobaaraa jud nahin sakate
 Many times it happens that people like to break up due to some estrangement with their spouse, but they become one again when they feel lacking in life again
 dobaaraa rishte banaate vakt is baat kaa dhyaan rakhana jaruri he ki halaat hameshaa ek jaise nahin hote or aise main nae sire se rishte kii shuruyaat karne kii jarurat he
 Let us know some things that need to be kept in mind while building a relationship again
 PHOTOS: kaisaa tha shridevi or arjuna kapur kaa relation?vakt den-dobaaraa saath aate hi is baat kaa khyaal rakhane kii jarurat he ki turant apane rishte ko kisi tag ke saath jodne kii koshish naa karen
 Use a friendly attitude between each other aside from tags like boyfriend-girlfriend or husband-wife
 ek duusare ke saath vakt bitaayen or ek-duusare ke darmiyaan ek talmail baitaane kii koshish karen
 Don't ignore old mistakes - It is often the case that you have to separate from you due to your bad habits or behavior
 aise main jab aapako dobaaraa saath aane kaa mauka mili to is baat kaa khyaal rakhen ki jo galtiyaan aapane pehali baar kii thim unhen aap naa doharaaen
 If you make the same mistakes again and again, the result will not be positive
 bahan ne kar diya tha shridevi par mukadmaa, haal hi main mili thim dubai menek-duusare ko samajhen-kai baar rishton main aisa bhi dekhne ko miltaa he ki log ek duusare ke saath rahete to hai, par ek duusare ko thik se samajhane main chook jate hai
 In such a situation, it is important that when you give a new dimension to your relationship, keep in mind that what the person expects from you and how you can meet his expectations
 saath hi aap saamne vaale se kya chaahate hai ise bhi saaf taur par baat dena phaayde kaa sauda hoga
 6 Things That Tell 'they' Like You Keep Your Relationship Away From People - Keep Your Relationship Away From People Until You Completely Remove Your Misconceptions and Problems
 ye swabhaavik he ki aap dobaaraa saath hone ki khushi ko dusron se baantnaa chaahate hai
 But if you hurry to announce it will not be right
 isliye behatar yahi hoga ki aap jab nae sire se apane rishte ki shuruyaat karen to pehle kuch samay ke liye use paripakv hone den uske baad ise dusron se share karen
 Bihar is planning to transform its 53,000 home guard strong organization into an influential force that can help in the event of crisis across the country
 police ke liye sahaayak bal kii bhoomika nibhaa rahe homeguard lathi or rifl se las hote hai, jo 300 rupee ke dihadi par kaam karte hai
 This force evolved from the Mughal and British Chowkidari systems and was formed in 1946 as a separate force in the erstwhile Bombay State

 Mahesh Sharma, Satish Kumar Gautam from Aligarh, Hema Malini from Mathura, Rajveer Singh from Etah, Dharmendra Kumar Kashyap from Aonla, Santosh Gangwar from Bareilly and Ajay Kumar Mishra from Lakhimpur Kheri
 jat banaam jat ke bich ladayeeupi main jat land maane jane vaali mujffarnagar or bagpat seat par bijepi kaa sidhaa muqabla areldi se he
 BJP has fielded Satyapal Singh in Baghpat seat, while Chaudhary Ajit Singh's son Jayant Chaudhary from RLD is in the fray
 aise hi mujffarnagar seat se bijepi ne sanjeev baalion ke saamne areldi ke adhyaksh choudhary ajit singh siyaasi ran main utre hai
 In this way, there is a battleground between Jats and Jats on these seats
 jabaki pichley chunaav main bagpat se satyapal singh ne modi lahar ke sahare bagpat seat par jayant choudhary ke pita ajit singh ko maat dekar saansad bane or phir mantri
 At the same time, due to the Muzaffarnagar riots, the benefit of polarization was given to Sanjeev Balyan

 At the same time, the Congress has also announced not to field its candidate
 vaisya banaam vaisya kii ladayeemeerut seat se bijepi ne apane do baar ke saansad rajendra agarwal par ek baar phir daanv lagaaya he
 While Congress has fielded Harendra Agarwal, son of former UP Chief Minister Babu Banarsi Das

 However, the SP-BSP-RLD alliance has placed bets on Haji Yakub Qureshi
 rajputon par jataayaa bada bharosapaschim upi main jat hi nahin balki rajput samudaay bhi kingmekar kii bhoomika main he
 This is the reason why BJP in western UP has tried to practice Rajputs along with Jat
 gajiabad se wike singh, bijanour se kunwar bharatendu, muradabad se kunwar sarvesh singh or aligarh se satish kumaar gautam par daanv lagaaya he
 However, in terms of political equation of the state, the Rajput voter is the main vote bank of the BJP in the current era
 obisi ko saadhane kii kavayadapaschim upi main obisi matadaataaon main gurjar or saini samudaay nirnaayak bhoomika main hai
 BJP has placed bets on Kanwar Singh Tanwar from Amroha to keep the Gurjar community alive
 saini or maury matadaataaon ko apane paale main jode rakhane ke liye sanbhal seat se parameshwar laal saini or badaayun se swami prasad maury kii beti sanghmitra maury ko maidan main utaara he
 In order to woo voters like this, the party has relied on Dharmendra Kashyap from Amla and Santosh Gangwar from Bareilly once again for the Kurmi vote

 Sukhbir Singh Badal said- 'see what happens in Dubai and Singapore, we will do the same here

 lekin yah daur alag he
 "haasan has started his political innings with his 6 lakh fans (fan club)
 unke prashansakon ke liye ve ulag naigan yani antarrashtriya star hai
 Says Haasan, "the lack of state resources is all a result of the greed of the leaders here
" ''ve apni cinemai chhavi ko bhunaane ke sthaan par kuch hatakar karte hue logon kaa samarthan hasil karne kii khwaahish rakhte hai or iske liye rajyavyapee rajnatik yatra kii taiyaari kar rahe hai
 "I am not going like a star but like a common citizen, whose politicians have never been interested in the well being
" ''hasan kehete hai, ''main us har cheez ke khilaaf hum jo janata ke khilaaf he
 All my policies will be targeted for public welfare
 isamen logon ko acchhee shiksha or bhrashtachar evam jatvaad se mukt shashan pradaan karnaa shaamil he
 "instead of alliances with corrupt parties, the MNM alone will gain the public's confidence by facing the challenges of this political journey
" unki party kaa naam dravid asmita se judata he to chunaav chinh main ek-duusare kii kalai thamati chah hatheliyaan dikhti hai
 Explaining the election symbol, Haasan says, "the six palms — each holding the wrist of another — symbolize the six South Indian states, while the star in the middle is a symbol of the people
 ''janata kii seva ke pehle kadam ke rup main hasan ne aath gaanvon ko god lekar unhen viksit karne kaa nishchay kiya he, antat ve rajya ke sabhi 32 jilon ke ek gaanv ko cover karenge
 Haasan wants to break the domination of the last five decades of Dravidian parties like the ruling AIADMK and the opposition DMK
 ye donon dal bhi hasan ke is nae rajnatik safar ke prati chaukanne or aakraamak dikhte hai

 The third problem is the worsening state of social justice and unemployment along with the continuing decline in the quality of education and health systems
 ve kehete hai, ''har koi yah maanata he ki tamilnadu rasaatal kii ore ja rahaa he
 The time has come to change the direction of politics
 ''ek tivi sho, ek lokapriy tamil patrika anand vikaton or soshal media kaa prayog karke yah abhinayta har us mudde par rajya sarkaar ke prati hamalavar he jisaki andekhi hui he
 Lok Sabha elections are due next year and Tamil Nadu is also expected to have a mid-term assembly elections
 agar sattarudh annadramuk ekajute hokar chunaav kaa saamana karne main asafal rahata he to kya isse camel hasan kii party ke liye apni jaden jamaane ko urvar bhoomi taiyaar hogi? yaa phir emenem bhi vico ke emdmake or vijayakaanth kii dmdike jaisi hi tamilnadu kii koi choti-moti rajnatik takat banakar rah jaaegi jinhen kul milakar mahaj das pratishat vot hasil hue?rajnatik vishleshkon kaa maananaa he ki hasan yaa phir ek rajnatik dal banaakar tamilnadu ke chunaavon main utarane kii ghoshnaa karne vaale rajnikant ke liye bhi ab zyada rajnatik sthaan bachataa nahin he
 Political analyst n
 satyamurti kehete hai, ''jayalalita ke nidhan ke baad machi rajnatik uthal-puthal ko media kawarej kii vajah se zyada hawa mili he
 Due to this, there is more curiosity among people
 hasan ko apni rajnatik kshamta or sanghathanaatmak kaabiliyat ko parakhane kaa mauka jald hi rajya ke sthaneey nikaay ke chunaavon ke dauraan milegaa
 For now, it does not seem that Hassan will be able to harm the deeply rooted Dravidian politics in the state, especially when the vote percentage difference between the AIADMK and the DMK and their allies was less than four per cent in any assembly election
 is

 The vacancy created by Karunanidhi's declining health opens doors of opportunity for him
 ab tak aisa nahin lagata ki hasan or rajnikant saath milakar koi rajnatik chunauti pesh karne ke liye sahamat honge
 Says Haasan, "I have not yet had any idea of his political outlook
" par main kisi paksh ke saath jaakar khadaa nahin hounga
 i have no religion, i believe in friendship

 They are yet to emerge as an alternative
 dravid pahchaan aadhaarit rajnatik dalon ke prati aae badlaav ko parakhane ke liye tamilnadu acha pareekshan sthal ho saktaa he
 Haasan's success will also depend on whether he is able to do something new in the coming months
 isse tay hoga ki ve tamilnadu kii raajnneeti ke nae sitare ke taur par ubharenge yaa phir kisi tuutate taare kii bhaanti gum ho jaaenge
 Haasan has to be prepared for both situations

 US President Donald Trump has done something to express happiness after the missile attack on Syria, due to which he is being trolled on social media
 twitor par unki aalochana kii ja rahi he or makhul udaaya ja rahaa he
 Also, questions are being fired on his tweet
 kaha ja rahaa ki trump ne itihaas se koi sikh nahin lee
 Indeed, after the attack on Syria, Trump tweeted, "accurate attacks on Syria were carried out last night
 france or britain kaa unki budhimatta or unki shandaar sena kii shakti ke liye shukriya
 This could not have led to better results
 mishan puraa hua
 The "trump's" Mission Accomplished "tweet reminded the then President George Bush of the announcement after the Iraq invasion in 2003 that he had made a mistake by declaring the mission complete
 haalanki baad main unako apni galati kaa ehsaas hua tha or unhone media ke saamne apni yah galati bhi maani thi
 As the Iraq war dragged on, Bush said he gave incorrect information
 trump kii is ghoshnaa ke baad se hairaani jataai ja rahi he ki aakhir syria main america kaa mishan itani jaldi khatm kaise ho gaya? sawaal yah bhi uthne lage ki kya syria ko lekar america ne apni ranneeti badali? isse peletrumpane ghoshnaa kii thi ki syria main khoonkhaar aatanki sanghathan islamic state (IS) kaa khaatmaa karne ke baad america sena syria se ravaanaa ho jaaegi yani america kaa mishan puraa ho jayega, lekin trump ne syrian chemical thikaanon par missile dagkar khud kii peeth thapthapate hue mishan khatm hone kaa elaan kar diya
 As soon as Trump tweeted that the mission was completed, social media people started raising questions about which mission was completed? Is the US military returning from Syria
 america ke hawaii se seenetter brian shatj ne kaha ki unako nahin lagata ki wo trump ke twit se bhuchakke ho sakate hai, lekin syria main mishan puraa hone ke elaan se hairaan hai
 It has to be double checked that it is not a lie
 i didn’t think i could be shocked by a tweet anymore but “mission accomplished” was so surprising i had to double check that it was not a spoof
 - Brian Schatz (@brianschatz) April 14, 2018 During the presidency of Bush, Ari Fletcher, White House press secretary, said he recommended removing words from the tweet that mission was completed
 unhone jorge bush dwaara iraq par hamalaa karne ke baad mishan puraa karne kii ghoshnaa kar di thi, lekin yuddh lanbaa khinchaa tha
 Trump's announcement has also been criticized by Mike Levine, a Democrat candidate for the 49th Congressional District of California
 iske alaava online news network chedder ke editor in chif ne bhi 'mishan puraa hua' par sawaal uthaae hai
 Mission Accomplished ??? Is there ANYONE in the White House with an understanding of history? Pic

 trump ke is bayaan par america videsh vibhaag ke pravaktaa hethar nort ne safai dete hue kaha ki raashtrapati kaa 'mishan puraa hua' se matlab syria ke teen chemical hathiyaar thikaanon ko safaltaapurvak nasht karne kaa mishan puraa hua he
 Resident doctors of Safdarjung Hospital in Delhi have returned to work
 ab se kuch der pehle doctoron ne hadtaal khatm karne kaa elaan kiya
 Earlier, the passengers were on a bad condition after doctors went on strike
 ilaaj karaane ke liye OPD main aae logon ko to pareshaani jhelni hi padi, aspataal main pehle se bhartee marizon ko bhi mushkil kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Many people got time for the operation after a long wait, but it was postponed due to the strike

 Sonia Gandhi reached Kota today to meet farmers affected by hailstorm in Rajasthan
 vahaan unhone kisaanon ke liye muaavze kii maang kii
 From this political point of view, the Congress wanted to clear the message that it is a party that takes care of the interests of the farmers
 haal hi main sonia gandhi ne dilli main bhi zamin adhigrahan kaanoon kaa mudda uthaaya tha
 Unaware of the unseasonal rains and the ground reality of hailstorm, Congress President reached Kota's Morpa and Derbiji villages
 kota un 26 zilon main se ek he, jahaan pachaas pratishat se zyada fasal karaab ho gai he
 Among such farmers are Jhamku Meena, whose entire two and a half bigha crop was destroyed
 paki hui gehun main pani bhar gaya he, 70 saal kii is vidhwaa ke liye jivan vyapan kaa or koi saadhan nahin
 Jhamku was one of the farmers whom Sonia Gandhi met
 jhamaku ne bataaya, 'meri puri fasal barbaad ho gai he, ghar main anaaj nahin he
 Now it is not even fit for animal feed
 ' Meeting the farmers, Congress President Sonia Gandhi said, 'the situation is very bad
 ham sarkaar se maang karenge ki inako muawza mili
 ' sonia gandhi kaa yah daura raajnneetik sandesh ke bina nahin tha
 This visit of the Congress President in Kota adjacent to the area of chief Minister Vasundhara Raje has political significance in itself
 lekin isko dekhte hue mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje unke is daure se thik ek din pehle bundi or jhalawad ke kisaanon se mil ain
 At the same time, during Sonia Gandhi's visit, she said that when the disaster comes, the problem is for everyone, not any particular party
 
 However, in view of the devastation that has taken place in 26 of the 33 districts of the state, political politics is also heating up
 ek taraf jahaan bijepi sandesh dena chaahati he ki sarkaar sankat main kisaanon ke saath he, to yah ek mauqaa congress ke liye bhi he ki vah apni khisakati hui raajnneetik jameen ko sanbhal le
 It is often seen in the morning and evening channels that our country lives in conflicting statements of politicians, artists and some stupid people
 yah ek simit maatra main zaruri ho saktaa he lekin kya yahi media system kaa kaam he
 Media system, which includes you as well as us
 agar bayanon main hi desh dikhegaa to ek din desh hamaare saamne aakar khadaa ho jayega
 Then it will happen that we will have no words left to speak
 jaise yah aadmi kandhe par apni bivi kii laash samet kar aapke hamaare drawing room main ghus aayaa he
 If Dana Manjhi does not tie his wife's corpse in a sheet-mat and shoulder it, remember when you heard the last news about Orissa on national channels running from Delhi
 aaj jab tamaam channelon par dana maanjhi apni patni kii laash lekar chal rahaa tha to uske saath saath kai buniyadi sawaal bhi chal rahe the
 This incident may be an exception, but this one incident has destroyed all the well-being of our society and system
 aap in tasveeron ko dekhte hue mere shabdon kaa intazaar na karen, apane shabd khud gadhen, khud roen, zaruri nahin he ki kuch kahen hi, thodi der chup bhi rahen, ho sake to apane kandhe par kuch baari chiz lad kar thodi dur paidal chalem
 If you cannot go outside, then walk to your drawing room
 aap rote rote apane system par hansane lagenge
 Laughing will start crying
 behatar he ki aap mahasoos karen ki is duniya main garibi naam kii yatnaa se batch gaye hai
 The media needs a villain every night
 dana maanjhi ke bahaane media ne apana khalanaayak dhund liya he, aspataal kaa prashasan
 The incident is from Kalahandi in Odisha, which has been the poor district of the country for many decades
 koi yah bataaye ki jab kalahandi main garibi dur nahin hui to desh main garibi kaise kam ho gai
 Dasaratha Manjhi of Bihar could not take his wife to the hospital, when she died, she cut the mountain in anger
 urisa kaa dana maanjhi apni patni kii laash kandhe par lad kar baarah kimi tak paidal chalata rahaa
 Together his daughter kept going
 isane hamaare tamaam bhramon ke pahaad ko kaat daalaa he
 Poverty has nothing but death to bring attention to the system and society
 zila kalahandi, panchayat nakhrudi, gaanv melghar
 This is the address of Dana Manjhi
 gaanv se saath kilometre dur bhavanipatana ke sarkari aspataal lekar aae the
 Manjhi's wife Amang Dei had TB
 aaj hi times of india main khabar chhapi he ki desh main tibi ke mariz dugane ho gaye hai
 His wife died on Wednesday night
 uske paas patni ko waapas ghar le jane ke liye paise nahin the, aspataal se madad maangi kisi ne suni nahin, so usne patni ko kandhe par lad liya or apni beti ke saath paidal nikal padaa
 When people saw that someone was walking with a corpse on their shoulder, a man named Pitambar Nayak stopped him at a place called Savada and assured him to help
 tabhi gaanv ke kuch logon ne mediakarmi ko phone kar bataaya or colector ko bhi soochna di
 The ambulance also reached within an hour of the media's arrival
 6 ghante tak dana maanjhi apni patni kii laash ko laade chal chuke the
 Dana Manjhi has told the story
 jo kaha he wo aap bhi padhein
 
 'doctor ne bolaa kii malaria hua he, tivi hua he bolaa phir medicine laane ke liye bolaa, phir main medicine lene ke liya gaya
 Those people cut the receipts, then i went to bring medicine, my money was gone
 burla lene ke liye bolaa
 i could not take the burla, i had no money
 phir bolaa jo karnaa he karo ham kuch nahin kar saktaa
 After speaking two or three times nothing happened, then my mind started to panic then at two o'clock in the night i left with dead body, what could i do, i had no one, the doctor did not help
 ' But when the government and administration say their thing, it starts with cleanliness, then reaches the investigation and then action is taken before the investigation
 kalahandi kii ziladhikari brunda devarajan ne kaha ki kareeb 2 baje bina bataaye vah shav ko lekar chale gaye
 If help had been sought, we would have helped
 dm ne yah bhi kaha ki aspataal ke staff ne unhen bataaya ki dana maanjhi ne sharaab pi rakhi thi
 Now the question can be asked to the District Magistrate how a corpse left the premises without any certificate from Astpal
 kya karmchaariyon ne bhi sharaab pi rakhi thi
 Do you think that this person who has been taking his wife's body for six hours is drunk from alcohol
 kya usne sharaab ke nashe main patni ke shav ko is tarah lapeta hoga
 Will be fastened kandhe par ladaa hoga
 He did not have drug money
 uske paas duusare aspataal tak le jane ke paise nahin the, kya ye sachai nahin ho sakati he
 While the Government of Odisha has made a plan to help such people
 aspataal se shav ko le jane ke liye rajya ke 37 aspataalon main 40 vine rakhi gai he
 The van was arranged under the Mahaprayana scheme, announced in February
 aaj yani guuruuvaar ko is yojana ke laanch kiye jane kii ghoshnaa kar di gai
 As long as his wife was alive, no one had given a single penny for the medicine, now that the matter has come up in the media, Red Cross has also given a sum of 15 thousand
 sarkaar ne bhi 12000 diye hai
 Orissa has Harishchandra scheme under which wood and ghee are given free of cost for the last rites
 aahat hone se, khud ko laanat bhejne se ham dana maanjhi ke saath nyaay nahin kar paayenge
 The news came from Gurgaon when he was leaving the office on Wednesday night
 vahi almunium city jise english main milinium city kehete hai
 Why is not said till date, but the news was that 11-year-old Neha stood in line for three hours waiting for her turn at the government civil hospital here
 apni maa ke saath aath baje line main lagi thi or 11 baje tak line main hi rahi
 When thirsty, the mother went to fetch water
 is bich neha behosh ho gai
 People somehow took him to the Emergency where he was declared dead
 parivaar waalon kaa kahana he ki uskaa ilaaj isi aspataal ke opidi main teen maheene se chal rahaa tha
 Senior medical officer has been transferred in the name of action
 chaturth shrenee kii ek mahila karmchaaree ko barkhaast kar diya gaya he or jaanch kaa elaan bhi ho gaya he
 But did it lead to any permanent solution to the suffering of common patients
 us maa ne kin shabdon main apana dukh bayaan kiya hoga, kya kah kar roi hogi, kya aapke paas wo shabd hai
 Have you asked the leaders why they do not talk about the Astpals
 gudgaanv ke siemo ne kaha he ki neha bahut gambhir haalat main ai thi
 He did not die due to negligence of anyone
 ham koshish karenge ki or bhi counter badha diye jaaen taaki marizon ko dikkat na ho
 Will CMO Saheb make the counters in all district hospitals of Haryana, why did not he get the earlier enhanced, is CMO Saheb waiting for Neha to die or will he raise the counters in a hospital and convince the media that a solution has been reached
 darasal, yah system kii samvedansheeltaa kaa patan he
 The sensitivity of society is not degraded
 samaaj ko lekar chaati peetane kii zarurat nahin he
 The question should be about the capacity of the system
 har jagah log aage ja jate he
 a few days ago this news came from Bahraich in Uttar Pradesh
 sarkaar kii yojana behatar or muft ilaaj kii hone ke baad rishwat na dene ke kaaran ek maa ke saamne uskaa biimaar betaa krishna mar gaya
 He said that the employee asked for twenty rupees to inject, which he did not have
 wo minnaten karti rahi lekin ward main maujuud kisi kaa dil nahin pasija, uskaa betaa mar gaya
 The same action took place here
 laaparvaahee se inkaar kiya gaya or karmchaaree kaa tabadalaa kar diya gaya
 As long as the picture of the corpse is carried on the shoulder, the question of hurting for TV will remain as soon as this question will turn to public health i
e
 health and treatment of common people, this issue will become boring for TV
 agar aap yah ummid karte hai ki media ab sarkari astapaalon kaa gauge legaa, praathmik chikitsa kendron kii taraf daud lagayegaa to mujhe yakeen he ki aap vahi darshak he jo in dinon bayanon kii bahes dekhte hai, junglee jaanwaron ke karnaamon par bees bees minute ke kaarykram dekhte hai or desh videsh kii vicitra kathaayen jinamein koi makaan se lataka he to koi rail ingine ke aage khadaa he
 Otherwise you do not expect such a thing at all
 kya tab bhi aap aahat hue the jab agra se yah khabar ai thi ki zila aspataal main jab punam kaa ilaaj nahin hua, use bhaga diya gaya, punam astpal se baahar ai or paidal chalane lagi
 The TB patient told Poonam that you have TB, you will not be treated
 do kimi hi chal pai thi ki uske sharir ne jawaab de diya
 Lay on the side of the road
 ganimat he ki rahgeeron kii nazar pad gai or doctor ko bula liya
 He was treated on the pavement itself
 haalat sudhari to usne halaat ke bare main bayaan kiya
 When the officials came to know that people had come to know, they sent the ambulance in the night itself
 jisamen koi doctor nahin tha
 Officers started accusing each other
 tippaniyan Do we not know how many doctors and employees are there during the night in government hospitals, is there anyone coming forward and telling us whether we have enough staff or not after you make a ruckus
 tabadalaa yaa nilamban se kuch nahin hoga
 Have a question
 rashtriya media bhale hi dilli mumbai se kaam chalaa letaa he lekin sthaneey akhabaaron main aisi laaparvaahiyon kii tamaam khabaren hoti hai
 Are they having any effect on the government and society or is nationalism happening without all this
 aap bhi kitni samasyaon ko yaad rakhenge
 This picture is of August last year, is from Madhya Pradesh
 31 agast ke rajasthan patrika or 3 sitambar ke hindustan times main chhapi he
 According to the news, 40-year-old Vishali Baiga of Umaria district hanged himself from a tree
 postermart ke liye koi gaadi nahin mili to khatiya par shav ko rakh apane kandhe par lad liye
 The two tribesmen walked the entire night carrying the dead body on their shoulders and reached Shahdol after walking for five hours
 devlal baigaa ne bataaya ki parivaar ke paas paise nahin the
 Could not rent a car
 us vakt paali thane ke sahaayak inspector ko nilambit kar diya gaya tha
 SN Pathak of District Hospital Shahdol had told in the magazine that we got a call but we do not have dead bodies
 sarkari aspataalon ke system ko khatm kiya jaataa rahaa he
 We do not speak because the middle and upper middle class, speaking, have started to consider insurance as a hospital
 ham philhal urisa kii ghatana par hi baat karenge ki media ko kya karnaa chahie tha
 Like this man has sneaked into our drawing room by covering his wife's body on his shoulder
 dana maanjhi agar apni patni kii laash ko chadar-chataayee main baandh kar kandhe par nahin ladata to yaad kiijie ki aapane aakhri baar dilli se chalane vaale rashtriya channelon par urisa ko lekar kab koi khabar suni he
 Today when Dana Manjhi was walking with his wife's corpse on all the channels, many basic questions were going along with it
 ho saktaa he yah ghatana apwaad ho lekin is ek ghatana ne hamaare samaaj or system kii tamaam khushrahmiyon ko dhwast kar diya he
 Do not wait for my words while looking at these pictures, make your own words, cry yourself, it is not necessary to say anything, even be quiet for a while, then walk some distance with some heavy thing on your shoulder
 
 baahar nahin ja sakate to apane drawing room main hi chalem
 You will start crying and laughing at your system
 hansate hansate rone lagenge
 It is better that you realize that you have survived the torture of poverty in this world
 media ko rose raat ek khalanaayak chahie
 Under the pretext of Dana Manjhi, the media has found its villain, the administration of the hospital
 ghatana urisa ke kalahandi kii he jo kai dashakon se desh kaa garib zila he
 Someone should tell how poverty has reduced in the country when poverty has not gone away in Kalahandi
 bihar ke dasharath maanjhi apni patni ko aspataal nahin le ja sake, mar gayi to gusse main pahaad kaat daalaa
 Dana Manjhi of Orissa carried his wife's body on his shoulder and walked for twelve km
 saath main uski beti chalati rahi
 It has cut our mountain of illusions
 garibi ke paas apni ore system or samaaj kaa dhyaan dilaane ke liye mrityu ke alaava kuch nahin hota he
 District Kalahandi, Panchayat Nakhrudi, Village Melghar
 yahi pataa he dana maanjhi kaa
 He was brought to the government hospital in Bhawanipatna, 60 km from the village
 maanjhi kii patni amang dei ko tibi ho gaya tha
 Today, there is a news in Times of India that TB patients have doubled in the country
 buudhvaar raat unki patni ne dam tod diya
 He did not have the money to take the wife back home, no one listened for help from the hospital, so he carried the wife on her shoulder and went out on foot with her daughter
 logon ne jab dekha ki koi kandhe par laash liye yun chalaa ja rahaa he to savada naamak jagah par peetaambar nayak naam ke ek aadmi ne use roka or madad karne kaa bharosa diya
 Then some people of the village called the media person and informed the collector
 media waalon ke pahunchane ke ghante bhar ke bheetar ambulance bhi pahunch gaya
 For 6 hours Dana Manjhi had gone to the dead body of his wife
 dana maanjhi ne aapbeetee bataai he
 You should also read what is said
 
 'the doctor said that malaria has happened, TV has happened, he said to bring medicine again, then i was taken to take medicine
 vah log recipt katkar diya phir main medicin laane ke liye gaya meraa paisa khatm ho gaya
 Said to take Burla
 main burla nahin le saktaa tha, meraa paas paisa nahin tha
 Then said whatever you want to do, we cannot do anything

 ' lekin sarkaar or prashasan jab apni baat kahenge to uski shuruyaat safai se hoti he, phir jaanch par pahunchati he or phir jaanch se pehle karrwai ho jaati he
 District Magistrate of Kalahandi, Brunda Devarajan said that at around 2 am he went away with the dead body
 agar madad maangi hoti to ham madad karte
 The DM also said that the hospital staff told him that Dana Manjhi had drunk alcohol
 ab sawaal ziladhikari se poocha ja saktaa he ki astpal ke campus se bina kisi pramaan patr ke koi laash lekar kaise nikal gaya
 Did the employees also drink alcohol
 kya aapako lagata he ki yah shaks jo chah ghante se apni patni ke shav ko liye ja rahaa he wo sharaab ke nashe main he
 Would he have wrapped the body of a drunk alcoholic wife like this
 baandha hoga
 Will be loaded on the shoulder
 uske paas dawa ke paise nahin the
 He did not have the money to take him to another hospital, could it not be the truth
 jabaki urisa sarkaar ne aise logon kii madad ke liye ek yojana bana rakhi he
 40 vans have been kept in 37 hospitals across the state to carry the body from the hospital

 The government has also given 12000
 urisa main harishchandra yojana he jiske tahat antim sanskaar ke liye lakdi or ghi muft main diya jaataa he

 Meanwhile, Neha fainted

 In what words would that mother have expressed her sorrow, what would she have cried by saying, do you have those words

 The CMO of Gurgaon has said that Neha was in a very critical condition

 We will try to increase more counters so that patients do not face any problem
 kya siemo sahab haryana ke saare zila aspataalon main counter badwa denge, pehle kyon nahin badwa diya, kya siemo sahab neha ke marane kaa intazaar kar rahe the yaa phir ek aspataal main counter badhaakar media ko jhansa de denge ki samaadhaan ho gaya he

 His ill son Krishna died in front of a mother for not giving bribe after the government plans better and free treatment
 uskaa kahana tha ki sui lagane ke liye karmchaaree ne bees rupee maange jo uske paas nahin the
 She kept praying, but the heart of anyone present in the ward did not budge, her son died

 If you hope that the media will now take stock of government hospitals, race towards first aid centers, then i am sure you are the same audience who sees the debate of statements these days, twenty twenty minute programs on wild animal exploits Let's see and the bizarre stories of foreign countries in which some are hanging from the house and some are standing in front of the train engine

 Were you still hurt when it was reported from Agra that when Poonam was not treated at the district hospital, she was banished, Poonam came out of Astpal and started walking
 tibi kii mariz punam ko aspataal waalon ne kaha ki tumhen tibi he, tumhaara ilaaj nahin hoga
 Her body responded when she could walk only two km

 Thankfully, the passers-by got their eye and called the doctor

 The comments kya ham nahin jaanate ki sarkari aspataalon main raat ke vakt kitne doctor or karmchaaree hote hai, kya hamaare aapke hangaamaa karne ke baad koi aage aakar yah bataa rahaa he ki hamaare paas paryaapt karmchaaree hai yaa nahin hai

 We will only talk about the incident in Orissa about what the media should have done
 zila kalahandi, panchayat nakhrudi, gaanv melghar
 This is the address of Dana Manjhi
 gaanv se saath kilometre dur bhavanipatana ke sarkari aspataal lekar aae the
 Manjhi's wife Amang Dei had TB
 aaj hi times of india main khabar chhapi he ki desh main tibi ke mariz dugane ho gaye hai
 His wife died on Wednesday night
 uske paas patni ko waapas ghar le jane ke liye paise nahin the, aspataal se madad maangi kisi ne suni nahin, so usne patni ko kandhe par lad liya or apni beti ke saath paidal nikal padaa
 When people saw that someone was walking with a corpse on their shoulder, a man named Pitambar Nayak stopped him at a place called Savada and assured him to help
 tabhi gaanv ke kuch logon ne mediakarmi ko phone kar bataaya or colector ko bhi soochna di
 The ambulance also reached within an hour of the media's arrival
 6 ghante tak dana maanjhi apni patni kii laash ko laade chal chuke the
 Dana Manjhi has told the story
 jo kaha he wo aap bhi padhein
 
 'doctor ne bolaa kii malaria hua he, tivi hua he bolaa phir medicine laane ke liye bolaa, phir main medicine lene ke liya gaya
 Those people cut the receipts, then i went to bring medicine, my money was gone
 burla lene ke liye bolaa
 i could not take the burla, i had no money
 phir bolaa jo karnaa he karo ham kuch nahin kar saktaa
 After speaking two or three times nothing happened, then my mind started to panic then at two o'clock in the night i left with dead body, what could i do, i had no one, the doctor did not help
 ' But when the government and administration say their thing, it starts with cleanliness, then reaches the investigation and then action is taken before the investigation
 kalahandi kii ziladhikari brunda devarajan ne kaha ki kareeb 2 baje bina bataaye vah shav ko lekar chale gaye
 If help had been sought, we would have helped
 dm ne yah bhi kaha ki aspataal ke staff ne unhen bataaya ki dana maanjhi ne sharaab pi rakhi thi
 Now the question can be asked to the District Magistrate how a corpse left the premises without any certificate from Astpal
 kya karmchaariyon ne bhi sharaab pi rakhi thi
 Do you think that this person who has been taking his wife's body for six hours is drunk from alcohol
 kya usne sharaab ke nashe main patni ke shav ko is tarah lapeta hoga
 Will be fastened kandhe par ladaa hoga
 He did not have drug money
 uske paas duusare aspataal tak le jane ke paise nahin the, kya ye sachai nahin ho sakati he
 While the Government of Odisha has made a plan to help such people
 aspataal se shav ko le jane ke liye rajya ke 37 aspataalon main 40 vine rakhi gai he
 The van was arranged under the Mahaprayana scheme, announced in February
 aaj yani guuruuvaar ko is yojana ke laanch kiye jane kii ghoshnaa kar di gai
 As long as his wife was alive, no one had given a single penny for the medicine, now that the matter has come up in the media, Red Cross has also given a sum of 15 thousand
 sarkaar ne bhi 12000 diye hai
 Orissa has Harishchandra scheme under which wood and ghee are given free of cost for the last rites
 aahat hone se, khud ko laanat bhejne se ham dana maanjhi ke saath nyaay nahin kar paayenge
 The news came from Gurgaon when he was leaving the office on Wednesday night
 vahi almunium city jise english main milinium city kehete hai
 Why is not said till date, but the news was that 11-year-old Neha stood in line for three hours waiting for her turn at the government civil hospital here
 apni maa ke saath aath baje line main lagi thi or 11 baje tak line main hi rahi
 When thirsty, the mother went to fetch water
 is bich neha behosh ho gai
 People somehow took him to the Emergency where he was declared dead
 parivaar waalon kaa kahana he ki uskaa ilaaj isi aspataal ke opidi main teen maheene se chal rahaa tha
 Senior medical officer has been transferred in the name of action
 chaturth shrenee kii ek mahila karmchaaree ko barkhaast kar diya gaya he or jaanch kaa elaan bhi ho gaya he
 But did it lead to any permanent solution to the suffering of common patients
 us maa ne kin shabdon main apana dukh bayaan kiya hoga, kya kah kar roi hogi, kya aapke paas wo shabd hai
 Have you asked the leaders why they do not talk about the Astpals
 gudgaanv ke siemo ne kaha he ki neha bahut gambhir haalat main ai thi
 He did not die due to negligence of anyone
 ham koshish karenge ki or bhi counter badha diye jaaen taaki marizon ko dikkat na ho
 Will CMO Saheb make the counters in all district hospitals of Haryana, why did not he get the earlier enhanced, is CMO Saheb waiting for Neha to die or will he raise the counters in a hospital and convince the media that a solution has been reached
 darasal, yah system kii samvedansheeltaa kaa patan he
 The sensitivity of society is not degraded
 samaaj ko lekar chaati peetane kii zarurat nahin he
 The question should be about the capacity of the system
 har jagah log aage ja jate he
 a few days ago this news came from Bahraich in Uttar Pradesh
 sarkaar kii yojana behatar or muft ilaaj kii hone ke baad rishwat na dene ke kaaran ek maa ke saamne uskaa biimaar betaa krishna mar gaya
 He said that the employee asked for twenty rupees to inject, which he did not have
 wo minnaten karti rahi lekin ward main maujuud kisi kaa dil nahin pasija, uskaa betaa mar gaya
 The same action took place here
 laaparvaahee se inkaar kiya gaya or karmchaaree kaa tabadalaa kar diya gaya
 As long as the picture of the corpse is carried on the shoulder, the question of hurting for TV will remain as soon as this question will turn to public health i
e
 health and treatment of common people, this issue will become boring for TV
 agar aap yah ummid karte hai ki media ab sarkari astapaalon kaa gauge legaa, praathmik chikitsa kendron kii taraf daud lagayegaa to mujhe yakeen he ki aap vahi darshak he jo in dinon bayanon kii bahes dekhte hai, junglee jaanwaron ke karnaamon par bees bees minute ke kaarykram dekhte hai or desh videsh kii vicitra kathaayen jinamein koi makaan se lataka he to koi rail ingine ke aage khadaa he
 Otherwise you do not expect such a thing at all
 kya tab bhi aap aahat hue the jab agra se yah khabar ai thi ki zila aspataal main jab punam kaa ilaaj nahin hua, use bhaga diya gaya, punam astpal se baahar ai or paidal chalane lagi
 The TB patient told Poonam that you have TB, you will not be treated
 do kimi hi chal pai thi ki uske sharir ne jawaab de diya
 Lay on the side of the road
 ganimat he ki rahgeeron kii nazar pad gai or doctor ko bula liya
 He was treated on the pavement itself
 haalat sudhari to usne halaat ke bare main bayaan kiya
 When the officials came to know that people had come to know, they sent the ambulance in the night itself
 jisamen koi doctor nahin tha
 Officers started accusing each other
 tippaniyan Do we not know how many doctors and employees are there during the night in government hospitals, is there anyone coming forward and telling us whether we have enough staff or not after you make a ruckus
 tabadalaa yaa nilamban se kuch nahin hoga
 Have a question
 rashtriya media bhale hi dilli mumbai se kaam chalaa letaa he lekin sthaneey akhabaaron main aisi laaparvaahiyon kii tamaam khabaren hoti hai
 Are they having any effect on the government and society or is nationalism happening without all this
 aap bhi kitni samasyaon ko yaad rakhenge
 This picture is of August last year, is from Madhya Pradesh
 31 agast ke rajasthan patrika or 3 sitambar ke hindustan times main chhapi he
 According to the news, 40-year-old Vishali Baiga of Umaria district hanged himself from a tree
 postermart ke liye koi gaadi nahin mili to khatiya par shav ko rakh apane kandhe par lad liye
 The two tribesmen walked the entire night carrying the dead body on their shoulders and reached Shahdol after walking for five hours
 devlal baigaa ne bataaya ki parivaar ke paas paise nahin the
 Could not rent a car
 us vakt paali thane ke sahaayak inspector ko nilambit kar diya gaya tha
 SN Pathak of District Hospital Shahdol had told in the magazine that we got a call but we do not have dead bodies
 sarkari aspataalon ke system ko khatm kiya jaataa rahaa he
 We do not speak because the middle and upper middle class, speaking, have started to consider insurance as a hospital
 ham philhal urisa kii ghatana par hi baat karenge ki media ko kya karnaa chahie tha
 For 6 hours Dana Manjhi had gone to the dead body of his wife
 dana maanjhi ne aapbeetee bataai he
 You should also read what is said

 main burla nahin le saktaa tha, meraa paas paisa nahin tha
 Then said whatever you want to do, we cannot do anything
 do teen baar bolne ke baad kuch nahin hua phir meraa man ghabaraane laga phir raat ko do baje main vahaan se mrit sharir ke saath nikal gaya, kya kar saktaa tha meraa paas koi nahin tha, doctor madad nahin kiya
 ' lekin sarkaar or prashasan jab apni baat kahenge to uski shuruyaat safai se hoti he, phir jaanch par pahunchati he or phir jaanch se pehle karrwai ho jaati he
 District Magistrate of Kalahandi, Brunda Devarajan said that at around 2 am he went away with the dead body
 agar madad maangi hoti to ham madad karte
 The DM also said that the hospital staff told him that Dana Manjhi had drunk alcohol
 ab sawaal ziladhikari se poocha ja saktaa he ki astpal ke campus se bina kisi pramaan patr ke koi laash lekar kaise nikal gaya
 Did the employees also drink alcohol
 kya aapako lagata he ki yah shaks jo chah ghante se apni patni ke shav ko liye ja rahaa he wo sharaab ke nashe main he
 Would he have wrapped the body of a drunk alcoholic wife like this
 baandha hoga
 Will be loaded on the shoulder
 uske paas dawa ke paise nahin the
 He did not have the money to take him to another hospital, could it not be the truth
 jabaki urisa sarkaar ne aise logon kii madad ke liye ek yojana bana rakhi he
 40 vans have been kept in 37 hospitals across the state to carry the body from the hospital
 vine kaa intazaam mahaprayan yojana ke tahat kiya gaya tha jiskaa elaan farvari main hua tha
 The launch of this scheme was announced today i

 on Thursday
 jab tak uski patni zindaa thi dawa ke liye kisi ne ek paise nahin die, ab jab media main baat aa gai he to red cross ne bhi 15 hazaar kii raashi di he
 The government has also given 12000
 urisa main harishchandra yojana he jiske tahat antim sanskaar ke liye lakdi or ghi muft main diya jaataa he
 Being hurt, sending ourselves a damn, we will not be able to do justice to Dana Manjhi

 The news came from Gurgaon when he was leaving the office on Wednesday night
 vahi almunium city jise english main milinium city kehete hai
 Why is not said till date, but the news was that 11-year-old Neha stood in line for three hours waiting for her turn at the government civil hospital here
 apni maa ke saath aath baje line main lagi thi or 11 baje tak line main hi rahi
 When thirsty, the mother went to fetch water
 is bich neha behosh ho gai
 People somehow took him to the Emergency where he was declared dead
 parivaar waalon kaa kahana he ki uskaa ilaaj isi aspataal ke opidi main teen maheene se chal rahaa tha
 Senior medical officer has been transferred in the name of action
 chaturth shrenee kii ek mahila karmchaaree ko barkhaast kar diya gaya he or jaanch kaa elaan bhi ho gaya he
 But did it lead to any permanent solution to the suffering of common patients
 us maa ne kin shabdon main apana dukh bayaan kiya hoga, kya kah kar roi hogi, kya aapke paas wo shabd hai
 Have you asked the leaders why they do not talk about the Astpals
 gudgaanv ke siemo ne kaha he ki neha bahut gambhir haalat main ai thi
 He did not die due to negligence of anyone
 ham koshish karenge ki or bhi counter badha diye jaaen taaki marizon ko dikkat na ho
 Will CMO Saheb make the counters in all district hospitals of Haryana, why did not he get the earlier enhanced, is CMO Saheb waiting for Neha to die or will he raise the counters in a hospital and convince the media that a solution has been reached
 darasal, yah system kii samvedansheeltaa kaa patan he
 The sensitivity of society is not degraded
 samaaj ko lekar chaati peetane kii zarurat nahin he
 The question should be about the capacity of the system
 har jagah log aage ja jate he
 a few days ago this news came from Bahraich in Uttar Pradesh
 sarkaar kii yojana behatar or muft ilaaj kii hone ke baad rishwat na dene ke kaaran ek maa ke saamne uskaa biimaar betaa krishna mar gaya
 He said that the employee asked for twenty rupees to inject, which he did not have
 wo minnaten karti rahi lekin ward main maujuud kisi kaa dil nahin pasija, uskaa betaa mar gaya
 The same action took place here
 laaparvaahee se inkaar kiya gaya or karmchaaree kaa tabadalaa kar diya gaya
 As long as the picture of the corpse is carried on the shoulder, the question of hurting for TV will remain as soon as this question will turn to public health i
e
 health and treatment of common people, this issue will become boring for TV
 agar aap yah ummid karte hai ki media ab sarkari astapaalon kaa gauge legaa, praathmik chikitsa kendron kii taraf daud lagayegaa to mujhe yakeen he ki aap vahi darshak he jo in dinon bayanon kii bahes dekhte hai, junglee jaanwaron ke karnaamon par bees bees minute ke kaarykram dekhte hai or desh videsh kii vicitra kathaayen jinamein koi makaan se lataka he to koi rail ingine ke aage khadaa he
 Otherwise you do not expect such a thing at all
 kya tab bhi aap aahat hue the jab agra se yah khabar ai thi ki zila aspataal main jab punam kaa ilaaj nahin hua, use bhaga diya gaya, punam astpal se baahar ai or paidal chalane lagi
 The TB patient told Poonam that you have TB, you will not be treated
 do kimi hi chal pai thi ki uske sharir ne jawaab de diya
 Lay on the side of the road
 ganimat he ki rahgeeron kii nazar pad gai or doctor ko bula liya
 He was treated on the pavement itself
 haalat sudhari to usne halaat ke bare main bayaan kiya
 When the officials came to know that people had come to know, they sent the ambulance in the night itself
 jisamen koi doctor nahin tha
 Officers started accusing each other
 tippaniyan Do we not know how many doctors and employees are there during the night in government hospitals, is there anyone coming forward and telling us whether we have enough staff or not after you make a ruckus
 tabadalaa yaa nilamban se kuch nahin hoga
 Have a question
 rashtriya media bhale hi dilli mumbai se kaam chalaa letaa he lekin sthaneey akhabaaron main aisi laaparvaahiyon kii tamaam khabaren hoti hai
 Are they having any effect on the government and society or is nationalism happening without all this

 Could not rent a car

 If you hope that the media will now take stock of government hospitals, race towards first aid centers, then i am sure you are the same audience who sees the debate of statements these days, twenty twenty minute programs on wild animal exploits Let's see and the bizarre stories of foreign countries in which some are hanging from the house and some are standing in front of the train engine

 aisa lagata he ki diwali se pehle aam aadmi ko dijal kii keemat main katautee kaa gift mil saktaa he
 It is reported that the price of diesel may decrease
 tel companiyon ko is vakt dijal par prati litre teen rupee chappan paise kaa phayda ho rahaa he
 This profit is due to the price reduction of crude oil
 ek rupee sasta hua petrougar dijal ke daamon main katautee hoti he, to paanch saal main aisa pehali baar hoga
 Let us tell you that the government currently controls diesel prices
 aise main katautee kaa sidhaa asar jaruri saamaanon kii keemat padegaa, kyonki transport sector main zyaadaatar isi eendhan kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 In fact, since last month, the government oil companies were making profits from the sale of diesel, since then the price cut was expected
 vaise tel companiyon ke liye bhi yah pehla mauka he, jab antarrashtriya bazaar main kachche tel kii keemat kam hone ke kaaran ve munafa main rahe
 However, the central government could not cut diesel prices due to the election code of conduct
 maaloom ho ki janvari 2013 se har maheene dijal kii keemton main 50 paise prati litre kii badhotaree hoti rahi he, taaki tel companiyaan isaki bikri se hone vaale nuksaan ko kam kar sake
 Diesel prices have increased 19 times in the last 20 months
 natijatan dijal 11
 81 per liter became expensive
 is saal sitambar maheene main dijal kii keemton ko nahin badhaayaa gaya tha
 Nearly 75 professors and academics of Indian origin, working in prestigious institutions of Britain including Cambridge and Oxford University and London School of Economics, have written an open letter and attacked Narendra Modi, saying, "the idea of modi coming to power terrifies us
" 
 landan skool of iconomix ke professor chetan bhatta evam gautam appa ne britain ke vam jhukaav vaale samachaarpatr 'independent' ke liye ek khulaa patr jari kiya
 The letter targeted the bjp's prime ministerial candidate, saying that now that the people of India are voting to elect the next government, we are very concerned about the impact on the Narendra Modi-led BJP government on India's democracy, pluralism and human rights
 
 'satta main modi kaa vichaar hamen bhaybheet karata he' sheershak vaale is patr main kaha gaya, narendra modi hindu rashtravaadi andolan, mukhya rup se aresas evam sangh parivaar samoohon main rache based hai
 Their history has been to incite violence against minorities
 inamen se kuch samooh nagarikon ke khilaaf haalia aatankwaadi hamalon main aaropee hue hai
 Before this letter, Indian-origin writer Salman Rushdie and artist Anish Kapoor and others sent an open letter to the 'guardian' newspaper earlier this month
 'independent' main prakashit patr ke anusaar, gujarat main modi ke shashan ke adhinayakawadi prakruti ko lekar ek vyapak sahmati hai or yah baat haal main bijepi ke bheetar anya varisht netaaon ko haashiye par daale jane se pramanit hoti he
 Such a rule will weaken Indian democracy
 isamen kaha gaya ki modi-bijepi ke aarthik vikaas kaa model sarkaar kaa bade vyapaar ke saath najdiki sambandh kaayam karata he tathaa sampann logon ko saarvajanik sansadhano kaa udaartaa se sthanantaran karata he tathaa garibon ke liye nuksaandeh upaay karata he
 So far 43 people have died in this accident
 vahiin anya logon kaa dilli ke alag alag aspataalon main ilaaj kiya ja rahaa he
 Let me tell you, a total of 64 people were evacuated from the factory
 Atul Garg, Chief Fire Officer, Delhi Fire Service (DFS) on fire incident at Rani Jhansi Road: The building did not have fire clearance from DFS and no fire safety equipment were found installed in the premises
 After the incident, CM Arvind Kejriwal has announced a compensation of 10 lakh to the kin of the deceased and 1 lakh to the injured
 vahiin bijepi (bjp)ne bhi mritkon ke parijanon ko 5 lakh or ghayalon ko 25-25 hajaar dene kaa elaan kiya he
 Some old man was staring at me for a long time wearing glasses of ray-ban, some distance away from the polling booth of Rajwada in Muzaffarpur
 unki jhijak samajhate hue main khud hi unke paas gaya
 Then a series of things started that did not stop
 bataaya ki naam es
 K
 shrivastav he
 Have retired apni jameen borwail ke liye sarkaar ko di taaki gaanv waalon ko pani mil sake
 It has been many years but nothing has happened there yet
 unase baatcheet chalati rahi, log judate gaye or apni-apni baat kehete gaye
 Everyone's complaint is about electricity
 gaanv main kuch ghanton ke liye hi bijli aati he
 When she comes, when she goes, everyone is trusting
 bolte hai jab tak bijli nahin aati bihar main na to udyog dhandhe lagenge na hi logon ko rojgaar milegaa
 The conversation then turns to caste equations
 shrivastavaji daawa karte hai ki agadi jatiyaan majbooti se bijepi ke saath hai
 Then start counting the Brahmins, Kayasthas, Rajputs and Bhumihars, besides eight castes of Baniis are also with the BJP
 kushvaha or valmiki vot banta he
 Dusadh, Mushahar is fully connected
 ati pichhadon ke vot bhi mahagathbandhan or endie ke bich bante hai magar bada hissaa endie ko ja rahaa he
 He says that the Muslims and Yadavs are completely with Lalu Prasad
 magar jahaan jediu yaa congress ummidavaar hai, yadav vot das-bees fisadi tak bant rahaa he
 The youth of Yadavs is shouting modi-modi
 unka kahana saaf he
 The yadav-muslim vote of the Mahagathbandhan equals the nda's forward-dalit mahadalit-vaishya vote and the support of the most backward castes leads the NDA to a two-thirds majority
 ummidavaaron kii bhoomika kahin prishthbhumi main chali gai he
 It is just about Lalu and Modi
 baatcheet main nitish kaa zikr kabhi-kabhaar hi aata he
 Srivastavji, who has seen seventy springs of life, asks a person from Paswan society to sit and make a khaini
 munh main kheni dabaa kar kehete hai bijepi satta main ai to siem banane laayak pehle se dasven number tak keval ek hi netaa he- susheel modi
 They say that the strong turnout in the fourth phase is pointing to the BJP wave
 unka maananaa he ki pehle teen charan main kadaa muqaabala hua or chauthe ne bijepi ko nirnaayak badhat de di
 About the fifth, he says that Owaisi is winning two seats and Muslim votes will be cut on the rest, which will benefit BJP
 unki ummiden pappu yadav par bhi tiki hai
 They are claiming that Yadav is making a dent in the votes
 shrivastavaji kaa saaf maananaa he ki agar bijepi kii sarkaar banati he to isamen lalu virdohi bhaavana kii badi bhoomika hogi
 That is when a person comes by cycling fast
 uski khabar he ki nazadik ke poling booth par aath sau main se kareeb chah sau vot laalaten ko gaye hai
 There, along with yadav-muslims, some votes of Kushwaha, Nonia and Mallahs also went to the grand alliance
 ye sunakar shrivastavaji ke munh kaa zaayaqa karaab ho jaataa he
 After talking here and there for some time, the speculative market appeared in today's Dainik Jagran starts referring to the news of the market
 bolte hai isamen endie ko 140 siton kii baat he
 The comments bolte hai- satta bazaar to paison kaa khel he, wo to galat nahin ho saktaa
 Saying this, i look at me with hopeful eyes in the hope that i will support his words
 meri nazaren unke chehre se bhatak kar nazadik kii chaay kii dukaan par chali jaati he
 The chaiwala, who was trying to make tea by blowing coal, is calling his boy
 ye kehane ke liye ki charge ke liye dhoop main rakhe solar lamp ko thodaa khiskaa de kyonki vahaan chaaya hone lagi he
 Meanwhile, the Mercedes Benz luxury bus filled with foreign tourists from the nearby Chamcham road goes off with dust
 main shrivastavaji se ye kehete hue vidaa letaa hum ki unki baat sahi he yaa galat, iskaa pataa to ab aath tarikh ko hi chalegaa
 Told that the name s

 ritair ho chuke hai
 Gave his land to the government for borewells so that the villagers could get water
 kai saal ho gaye magar abhi tak vahaan kuch nahin hua
 The conversation continued with them, people joined and went on to say their respective things
 sabaki shikaayat bijli ko lekar he
 The village gets electricity for a few hours only
 kab aati he kab jaati he sab bhagwaan bharose he
 It is said that until electricity comes in Bihar neither the industries will start business nor people will get employment
 phir baatcheet jatigat samikarnon kii ore mud jaati he
 Shrivastavji claims that the forward castes are firmly with the BJP
 phir ginane lagate hai brahman, kysth, rajput or bhoomihaar ke alaava baniyon kii aath jatiyaan bhi bijepi ke saath hai
 Kushwaha and Valmiki vote is divided
 dushaadh, mushahar puri tarah se judaa he
 The votes of the most backward are also divided between the Grand Alliance and the NDA, but a large part is going to the NDA
 wo kehete hai ki udhar muslim or yadav puri tarah se lalu prasad ke saath hai
 But where there are JDU or Congress candidates, the Yadav vote is divided by 10-20%
 yadavon kaa yuva modi-modi chilla rahaa he
 They are clear
 mahagathbandhan kaa yadav-muslim vot endie ke agade-dalit mahadalit-vaisya vot ko baraabar kar detaa he or ati pichhadi jatiyon kaa samarthan endie ko do-tihaai bahumat kii ore le jaataa he
 The role of the candidates has gone somewhere in the background
 baat sirf lalu or modi kii he
 Nitish is rarely mentioned in conversation
 jivan ke sattar basant dekh chuke shrivastavaji paas baithe paswan samaaj ke ek vyakti se kheni banane ko kehete hai
 Silence in the mouth, says if the BJP comes to power, there is only one leader from the first to the tenth position to become CM - Sushil Modi
 wo kehete hai chauthe charan main hua jabardast matdaan bijepi kii lahar kii ore ishaara kar rahaa he
 He believes that the first three phases were tough and the fourth gave the BJP a decisive edge
 paanchave ke bare main wo kehete hai ki ovaisi do seat jeet rahe hai or baaki par muslim vot kaatenge, jisase bijepi ko phayda hoga
 His hopes are also set on Pappu Yadav
 daawa kar rahe hai ki wo yadav voton main send laga rahe hai
 Shrivastavji clearly believes that if the BJP government is formed then anti-lalu sentiment will play a big role in it
 tabhi ek vyakti tezi se saaikal se aata he
 It is reported that about six hundred votes out of eight hundred have gone to the lantern at the nearby polling booth
 vahaan yadav-muslimon ke saath kushvaha, nonia or mallahon ke kuch vot bhi mahagathbandhan ko gaye
 Hearing this, the taste of Shrivastavji's mouth becomes bad
 kuch der idhar-udhar kii baat karne ke baad aaj ke dainik jaagran main chhapi satta bazaar kii khabar kaa hawala dene lagate hai
 Let's talk about 140 seats for the NDA
 tippaniyan Speak- Speculative market is a game of money, it cannot be wrong
 ye kahkar aashaa bhari nazaron se meri ore dekhte hai is ummid main ki main unki baat kaa samarthan karuunga
 My eyes stray from their faces and move to the nearest tea shop
 koyale main phoonk dekar chaay banane kii koshish karne main laga wo chywala apane ladke ko awaz laga rahaa he
 To say that, for the charge, move the solar lamp in the sun slightly, because there is a shadow
 is bich paas kii chamaacham sadak se videshi paryatakon se bhari marcedes benz kii lakjri bas dhul udaati hui chali jaati he
 i say goodbye to Srivastavji by saying that his point is right or wrong, it will be known only on the 8th
 phir baatcheet jatigat samikarnon kii ore mud jaati he

 Central Arun Jaitley said that by successfully penetrating the terrorist camps of jaish-e-mohammed by entering Pakistan, India has opened the barrage of Pakistan's nuclear bullying
 shanivaar ko ek samachar channel ke kaarykram main jetali ne kaha, "pakistan ne bharat se convensional waar (paramparaagat yuddh) 1965, 1971 main ladaa
 In the Kargil war he did not come to take the corpses of his soldiers and lost
 to pakistani fouj ne dekha ki ham convensional waar main bharat kii majboot arthvyavastha or superior milrity strength ke saamne tik nahin sakate
 "they said that they had two options - one, proxy war (proxy war) through terrorists and the other option called nuclear bluff (nuclear bullying), because both countries have nuclear weapons
 is baar unka newclear blf bhi expoj ho gaya
 Jaitley targeted the opposition parties, seeking evidence of the Jaish terrorists being killed in an airstrike by the Indian Air Force in Balakot, Pakistan
 unhone kaha, "raajnneetik dalon or netaaon ko yah samajhnaa chahie ki duniya kii koi bhi sena apana oparational ditels (karrwai kaa byora) saarvajanik nahin karti
 This is the misfortune of the country and some leaders have such unintelligence that they are in public life today
 ve jane-anjaane main aise bayaan dekar pakistan kaa gavaah ban rahe hai
 i think that the public will make them feel that they will get TRP in Pakistan TV and will have to tolerate public outrage in India
 "pulavama hamale ke shaheedon kii vidhwaaen haalanki karrwai kaa byora nahin, maare gaye aatankiyon kii koi bhi tasviir maang rahi hai
 She is saying that if only a picture was shown, her heart would get cold
 upgrah kii madad se tasviir uplabdh karnaa naammumkin bhi nahin he
 Jaitley said, "no army or air force makes public its operational details anywhere in the world
" america ne abtabad (pakistan) main hamalaa kiya, alqaida ke chif osama bin laden kii hatya kii or uski laash samudr main phenk diya or koi oparational ditels duniya se share nahin kiya
 Taking a dig at Congress leader Kapil Sibal, who questioned the success of the Indian Air Force air strike, Jaitley said, "it is unfortunate that such people are in public life
" agar oparation ditels saarvajanik kiya gaya to kapil sibbal ko hi nahi pakistan kii fouj ko bhi pataa chal jayega ki hamaare kitne miraj ude, kahaan se ude, kitne bam barasaaye or kis raste se aatanki canmp ko target kiya
 "he said that it was Pakistan's army and not the government that first informed the people about the air strike
 pakistan ne sabase pehle duniya ko strike ke bare main jaankaree di
 
 unhone kaha ki iske peeche do mukhya kaaran the
 Firstly, his army has created a large image among the people in Pakistan
 wo desh apane nagarikon ke saamne kaise jaakar kah saktaa tha ki hindustan ke hawaii jahaaj ne jaish ke camp par bam barasaaye
 Jaitley said that the second reason is even greater
 agar pakistan puri duniya se shikaayat karata ki dekhiye bhartiya vimaanon ne hamaare elosi kaa ulanghan kiya to pehla sawaal uthta-aapkaa nuksaan kya hua? phir to antarrashtriya samudaay nuksaan ko dekhne aata
 
 koun sa camp vahaan par chal rahaa tha? camp main kitni building thi or saikadon log rah rahe the
 
 swimming pul
 
 gymnasium tha
 
 jo vahaan par mare unke bare main poochhate
 
 wo koun log the
 
 ek-ek karte unke bisiyon commander or puraane-nae fidaayin ke naam saamne aate
 Jaitley said, "there can be no dialogue with Pakistan unless it takes any decisive action against terrorist organizations
" wo karrwai puri duniya ko dikhni chahie or pakistan uskaa saboot degaa, tab ham sochenge ki kya karnaa he
 There is no justification for raising voices for dialogue right now

 In this sequence, BJP included SP leader Rajmati Nishad and his son Amarendra Nishad in the party

 After this, SP MP from Gorakhpur Pravin Nishad also joined BJP and SP immediately started mobilizing Nishad voters by declaring Ram Bhual Nishad as the party candidate

 ) BJP names for the post of mayor in all three mcds of Delhi have not been agreed so far
 yahi vajah he ki somvaar 16 april ko east emsidi main meyar pad ke liye namakan kii aakhri taarikh ko en vakt par ek baar phir aage badha diya gaya he
 The date of nomination of Mayor of East Delhi Municipal Corporation has now been extended to 18 April
 isse pehle east emicidi main meyar pad ke liye namakan kii aakhri taarikh 13 april se badhaakar 16 april kii gai thi, lekin ise 16 se badhaakar ab 18 april kar diya gaya he
 On the same day, the last date for the nomination of the mayor has already been announced in the remaining two mcds of Delhi, ie, North and South MCD
 yani abatinon emsidike liye meyar kaa namakan ek hi din hoga
 In addition to the last date of nomination, the dates of Mayor's election in the East have also been extended from April 24 to April 27
 somvaar ko meyar or dipti meyar ke namakan ke liye sabhi parshad east emsidi mukhyalay pahunch gaye the lekin dopaher tak kisi ek naam par sahmati nahin ban pai or aakhirkaar 4 baje bataaya gaya ki namakan or meyar ke chunaav kii taarikh aage badha di gai he jiske baad nigam sachiv ne bhi nai tarikhon kii adhisuchana jari kar di

 pichley saal hue emsidi chunaav main bijepi ko prachand bahumat milane ke baad teenon mahila meyar kaa kaarykaal ab khatm hone ko he
 According to the DMC Act, in the first year the post of mayor is reserved for women and in the second year the post of mayor is for general category
 aise main is baar meyar ke liye mahilaon ke saath purush ummidavaar bhi apni daavedaari thok rahe hai
 If sources are to be believed, the number of claimants is high this year due to the general position of the mayor, due to which the BJP is getting sweaty in deciding the name of the mayor in the three mcds
 isliye ab tay kiya gaya he ki teenon emsidi main namakan ke din ek hi saath meyaron ke naam kaa elaan kiya jayega

 The comments rahane ke 62 ran ke score par aljari joseph kii gend par out hone ke saath hi yah saajhedaari tuuti lekin is dauraan yah jodi kuch record apane naam par karne main safal rahi

 aam aadmi party ne 26 janvari tak ek karod sadsy banane kaa lakshya rakhaa tha
 It is being told that it has become a member of 50 lakhs, but what is going on in this huge membership campaign, the party is aware of it
 isi kaa nateeja he ki bhaajapa ke varisht netaa or purv pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi or vartmaan main bhaajapa kii ore se piem pad ke pratyaashee narendra modi ne aam aadmi party kii sadsyta lee he
 Not only this leader, but the father of Facebook Mark Zuckerberg is also a member of AAP party
 itnaa hi nahin congress party ke upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ne bhi aap party kii sadsyta grahan kii he
 The BJP is calling it a fake
 buudhvaar ko hi aam aadmi party ne jaankaree di ki party 50 lakh se zyada sadsy apane saath jod chuki he
 If names like Vajpayee or Zuckerberg are also seen among these members, then this list starts to be suspect
 aise or bhi naam is suchi main bataae ja rahe hai
 However, it is not possible that this Farziwada is possible on a large scale
 kyonki ek mobile number par ek hi sadsyta lee ja sakati he
 That is, at least one official number is required to subscribe
 iske alaava 18 saal se kam umr vaale log sadsyta nahin le sakate hai
 Obviously, these names may have been deliberately inserted to make you confused
 lekin iskaa ek sabak ye he ki party ko is sadsyta par puri tarah yakeen nahin karnaa chahie

 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he) Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad attacked the Congress strongly on Rahul Gandhi's rhetoric in Bahrain regarding the Modi government at the Center
 unhone rahul gandhi se poocha ki teen talaak par congress kaa stand kya pyaar failaane vaala stand tha yaa phir nafrat failaane vaala stand tha
 Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said that Rahul Gandhi made many allegations against the Indian government abroad for spreading hatred and hatred
 vahaan unhone aisi baaten kii jo samaanyat: antarrashtriya manchon par nahin kahi jaati
 Why does Rahul not feel disgusted over the death of a volunteer? The party which cannot take a stand on women justice, is working to teach our government abroad
 > bharat main sabase zyada samudaay par nafrat kii raajnneeti congress party ne kii he
 > When RSS swayamsevaks are killed in Karnataka and Kerala, why does Rahul Gandhi not see hatred in it
 > aaj sadaken adhik ban rahi hai or iske madhyam se logon ko naukari bhi mil rahi he
 > About 40 lakh people are working Indirectly in the IT sector of India and about one crore 35 lakh people are working directly
 videsh jaakar ghrinaa va nafrat ke bhav failaa rahe rahul> aise chote shaharon main bipio aa rahe hai jahaan koi kalpana bhi nahin kar saktaa tha
 It includes cities like Bareilly, Patna and Allahabad
 > aaj kaaman sarvice centre do lakh 70 hajaar hai jo pehle 80 hajaar the, isamen 10 lakh log kaam kar rahe hai
 > When our government came, there were only two mobile factories which has now become 108
 > rahul gandhi ko na kaam dikhaai padataa he na jaanane kii koshish karte hai or videsh jaakar ghrinaa va nafrat ke bhav failaate hai
 Rahul, who is strengthening the slogan 'bharat tere pieces hai', Congress does not speak on the spreading roots of the People's Front in Karnataka
 > congress ne gujarat main jatvaad ko aage badhaane kii koshish kii, or unke kandhon se upje hue umr khalid jaise logon ke saath rahul gandhi dilli main bhi baat karte hai or maharashtra main bhi baat karne kii koshish karte hai
 > India will be your pieces Insha Allah, Rahul Gandhi has been strengthened by the people who raise slogans of Insha Allah and their associates
 31 se kattarpathiyon ke saamne jhuk rahi congress> shah bano se syra bano tak congress ne 31 saal main agar congress ne apana tushtikaran or kattarpathiyon ke saamne jhukne kaa ravaiya nahin badla to ye saaf bataata he ki ghrinaa kii raajnneeti koun karata he
 Question on Rahul's love for China> Rahul Gandhi said in Bahrain that China works faster than India
 unka china se pyaar bhi rochak sawaal khadey karata he
 > Rahul Gandhi should read the December issue of Economist magazine, in which he tells his prediction for every year what is going to happen in the economic system of which country in the world
 > magazine ne pehali baar kaha ki india ek iconomik power house ban rahaa he or aane vaale do varshon main wo china se aage nikal jayega> rahul gandhi ko kuch bhi bolne se pehle home work karnaa chahie tha
 If they had gathered information, they would not have spoken such things about India abroad
 gauratlab he ki somvaar ko congress adhyaksh kaa padbhaar grahan karne ke baad bharat ke baahar pehali baar pravasi bharatiyon ko apane sambodhan main rahul gandhi ne sarkaar par logon ko jati evam dharm ke aadhaar par baantne kaa aarope lagaaya
 Along with this, he alleged that the government is turning the anger of unemployed youth into hatred in the society
 unhone pravasi bharatiyon se ghrinaa evam vibhaajan kii shaktiyon se ladane main madad kii apil kii
 Rahul Gandhi assured the Overseas Indian community here that he will bring forth a new 'shining Congress Party' in the next six months which people will trust
 is tarah unhone sanghathan main vyapak badlaav kaa sanket diya
 He said that there is a 'serious problem' in the country and he appealed to the diaspora to become a partner in helping to solve it and provide a new form
