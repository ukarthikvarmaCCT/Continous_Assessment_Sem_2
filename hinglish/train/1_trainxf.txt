 Congress President needs to reply on Saifuddin Soz's statement & if Congress vouches for his statement
 If he (saifuddinsoz) has so much affection for Pakistan & Musharraf then he should consider migrating to Pakistan and become his servant: Manisha Kayande, Shiv Senapic

 com / jsgvt0z36w — ANI (@ANI) June 22, 2018 Congress leader PL Punia has called Saifuddin Soz's statement nonsense
 unhone kaha ki kashmir main har baar logon ne chunaavon main bhaag lekar ye bataaya he ki unhen bharat ke loktantr main vishwaas he
 He said that this is his personal statement, the party believes that Kashmir is a part of India
 kya kaha he safuddin soj ne?safuddin soj ne pakistan ke purv raashtrapati parvaiz musharraf ke us bayaan kaa samarthan kiya he jisamen unhone kaha tha ki agar kashmiriyon ko mauka mili to vah kisi ke saath jane ke bajaay aaazaad hona chahenge
 Soz says that Musharraf's statement made more than a decade ago still fits in many ways
 haalanki, unhone ye bhi kaha ki ye aazaadee milanaa mumkeen nahin he
 My statements have nothing to do with the party
 yahaan padhein puraa bayaan, congress netaa soj bole- sahi he musharraf kaa bayaan, aazaadee hi chaahate hai kashmiriastak kaa intervyuu bich main chhodkar bhageshuukravaar subah jab is mudde par ajtak ne unase baat kii to vah sawaalon par baukhala gaye or bich main hi intervyuu chhod kar bhaag gaye
 In his conversation with Aaj Tak, he repeatedly emphasized that if peace is to be established in Kashmir, everyone will have to talk
 unhone algaavvaadi netaaon se bhi baat karne kaa samarthan kiya
 However, he said that this statement has nothing to do with his party Congress
 safuddin soj ne kaha ki kashmiri log naa hindustan ke saath aana chaahate hai naa hi pakistan ke saath, wo sab aazaadee chaahate hai
 But this freedom is impossible

 guru poornima ke din janata dal united ke vidhaan parshad sarkari avkaash chaahate hai
 But making this demand in Bihar Legislative Council cost him dearly, because Chief Minister Nitish Kumar did not like it
 unhone ulte vidhaan parshadon ko us din 2 ghante zyada kaam karne kii naseehat de daali
 In fact, two legislative councilors of Janata Dal United, Sanjeev Kumar Singh and Ranveer Nandan, demanded a government holiday on Guru Purnima
 ranvir nandan to do kadam aage jaakar sadan main guru poornima ke mahatv or sanskrit main shloke padhane lage
 Meanwhile, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, who was watching the proceedings of the House on TV from his room, found this demand completely unconvincing
 iske baad wo turant sadan main aae or aate hi unhone kaha is maang se mujhe bada aashcharya hua he
 Do you want a holiday that you worship every day? Then he said that what is going on now, Gupta Navratri is going on right now
 to kyon nahin kehete ki gupt navaratri par bhi puri chuttee de di jaae
 Then he said that on the day of Guru Purnima, the action of the House should be increased by two hours
 iske baad nitish kumaar ne kaha aap kya chaahate hai ki guru kii puja he to chuttee manaani he
 You can worship at any time
 aap kya chaahate hai ki aap jitne parv manaayenge sab din chuttee ho jaae
 Let it be a public holiday
 aapke guruon ne yahi sikhaaya he ki din bhar ghar main baithe raho or koi kaam naa karo
 Rather, he has inspired all of you to do more work
 isliye aap logon kii is maang se mujhe bada aashcharya hua he
 After this talk of Nitish Kumar, every member in the house, especially the members of the ruling party were peeping

 Something similar was observed during the two-day session of the Delhi Legislative Assembly that began on Tuesday
 dilli ke bascindia in dinon beshak janvari kii kadaake kii thand kaa saamana kar rahe hon lekin dilli vidhansabha main beete saal kaa monsoon satr jari hi he
 When the two-day session of the Delhi Assembly was called on Tuesday, very few people will know that the proceedings of the House are going on in the new year i
e
 2017 also under the previous year's monsoon session
 amuman aisa hota he ki dilli vidhansabha kaa sheetakaaleen satr november yaa disambar maheene main bula hi liya jaataa he, lekin dilli sarkaar ne kisi na kisi vajah se monsoon satr kaa satravsaan karnaa hi jaruri nahin samajha he
 That is, the government did not finish the monsoon session of Delhi Legislative Assembly which started on 9 June 2016
 17 or 18 janvari kaa vidhansabha satr monsoon satr 2016 kaa chatha hissaa he
 Why the government did this, many political speculations are being made behind it
 darasal dilli vidhansabha main vipaksh ke vidhayakon kii taadaad sirf 3 he, jinamein se ek bijepi vidhayak om prakaas sharma ko monsoon satr ke bich main yani 11 june 2016 ko sadan kii kaarywahi se do satr ke liye nilambit kar diya gaya tha
 If the winter session was called in Delhi, then OP Sharma's membership would be restored, which the Aam Aadmi Party does not want in view of his aggressive attitude within the House
 iske alaava jab bhi kisi nae saal menvidhansabhake satr kaa aagaaj kiya jaataa he, to uski shuruyaat uparajyapal ke abhibhaashan se hoti he, jo ki raashtrapati ke numaayinde hai
 But by continuing the session last year, the Aam Aadmi Party government also found out a way so that the new Lieutenant Governor of Delhi Anil Baijal would not have to address the assembly
 isapar jab mangalvaar ko vidhansabha kii baithak hui to vipaksh kii taraf se aapatti bhi darj karai gai
 If the Lieutenant Governor had his address, then in such a situation normally Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal would also have to be present in the Assembly as the Leader of the House, but the Chief Minister is currently campaigning for the party in Punjab elections, so his presence is also difficult was
 aisi sthiti main dilli vidhansabha main 2017 kaa pehla satr bajet satr hi hoga jo ki sambhavat: march main hoga
 By then, elections in Punjab and Goa will also be resolved and MCD elections will also be close
 aise menuparajyapalke abhibhaashan ke jariye aam aadmi party kii sarkaar apni uplabdhiyon kaa khub bakhaan bhi kar paaegi
 At the same time, OP Sharma will also be out of the budget session i
e
 the number of BJP mlas will also remain in the legislative assembly
 zyaada hangaame kaa bhi satta paksh ko saamana nahin karnaa padegaa
 When and how were the six parts of the session from June to January 1 - First part - 9 June to 13 June - Discussion on general issues and Question Hour 2 - Second part - 22 August to 26 August - The decisions of the High Court on the rights of the Government and Lt

 pehle ham sab sirf aatank ke bare main suna karte the lekin ab usee aatank ko apni ankhon se live dekhte hai
 Actually, whether it is about modern weapons or technology, the dangerous thing is that even terrorists are now making full use of these two
 vaardaat isi maheene kii he
 The terrorists had to blow up a police headquarters and also have to detain them on camera
 lihaaja pehle wo drone camere ko feet karte hai or uske baad dhamaakaa
 The video that gave Roop Kamp also saw pictures of this explosion, he was shaken
 aatankwaadiyon ne aatmghaatee hamale to bahut kiye, begunaahon kaa khun bhi bahut bahaya lekin apane kisi hamale kaa aisa video shoot kar use apni website par daalana or wo bhi taliban jaise aatankwaadi sanghathan ke liye, ye bilkul nai or chaunkaanewaali baat he
 The land-to-ground attack, at the first sight, of these attacks on the police headquarters in Nawa district of Afghanistan, was deemed by everyone to be a video of a drone attack
 lekin hakeekat kuch or thi
 The truth is that this suicide attack was carried out from ground to ground
 jabaki uski tasviren drone se lee gayi or wo bhi behad peshevraana tareeke se
 Video from preparation to attack: In this video, from preparation to attack, the blast is recorded
 video ke shuruyaat main ek aatmghaatee hamalavar apni hamvi gaadi ke saath najar aata he
 It is an anonymous hideout of the same Helmand province in Afghanistan, the area in which the incident took place

 ye gaadi ghumaavdaar raaston se hoti hui sidhe police headquarter tak pahunchati he or iske baad ek joardaar dhamaake ke saath puraa kaa puraa police headquarter hi aag ke gole main tabdeel ho jaataa he
 That is, the suicide bomber has managed to detonate his Humvee vehicle and blow it up
 jaanch puri hone se pehle talibane ne kiya hamale kaa daawaaye dhamaakaa itnaa joardaar tha ki dhamaake kii aawaaj na sirf saikadon feet oonche drone camere kii mike main saaf-saaf record ho jaati he balki dhamaake se paidaa hue kampan yani thartharaahat ko bhi saaf mahasoos kiya ja saktaa he
 At the same time, a tremendous clump of dust and smoke arises from the police headquarters, which falls on the sky of Helmand on sight, and the drone camera capturing the entire incident is also caught

 ISIS will soon be out of Mosul
 The last fighting continues between ISIS and the Iraqi army in Mosul city of Khatmirak
 aakhri isliye kyonki ab takreeban puure iraq or syria main iesas ke paanv ukhd chuke hai lekin mosul hi wo iklauti jagah he, jahaan aies ab bhi hichakiyaan le rahaa he
 But if the friendly country, Iraqi army and Kurdish fighters believe then these hiccups will also stop in a few days
 aakhri jang or puri tarah ukhd jaaenge ISIS ke paanvamosul yani iesas ke us aakhri kile main send lagane main ab iraqi fouj, mitra desh or kurdish fiteron ne kamyaabi hasil kar lee he
 Not only has he achieved success, but he has also started telling the ISIS merciless executioners their status
 iraq or syria ke is puure ke puure ilaake main ab zyaadaatar jagahon par iesas ke paanv ukhd chuke hai
 And now this Mosul is the only place left, where the last battle of the army is going on with these terrorists
 aatankiyon par jabardast kahar barapa rahi faujahaalat ye he ki america kii aguwai main mitra desh yahaan iesas par kahar barapa rahe hai
 There have been 32 air strikes on terrorists in this area in just one week
 aatankwaadiyon se lard rahe phogiyon ko 1700 nae aslhe saunpe gaye hai, jinhone iesas ke 136 banksron ko nestnabud kar diya he jabaki aatankiyon kii 18 surangen or 26 car bamon ko barbaad kar diya gaya he
 The common people in the war with ISIS, although the Iraqi government and Kurdish fighters have not yet released any exact figures of those who died in this war, but the way the Allies are doing aerial attacks on the terrorists here, they guessed it It is being said that the 'end' of ISIS has now come very close
 vaise to fouj ne bahut se chote-mote kasbon or gaanvon ko iesas ke kabje se aaazaad kara liya he lekin in halaat main sabase buree haalat is ilaake main rahane vaali mahilaon or bacchon kii hai, jin par ab ek-ek pal baari pad rahaa he
 Thousands of innocent people are in a dilemma whether to leave their homes or to start a new life leisurely after the ISIS is eliminated
 jabaki mosul kii sadakon par ab bhi hajaaron beghar log apane-apane gharon ko lautne ke intjaar kar rahe hai, jo beemaari or bhukh se buree tarah ghire hai or vakt badalane kaa intjaar kar rahe hai
 In search of Baghdadi, however, all the forces currently fighting ISIS are looking for the world's largest executioner, Abu Bakr al Baghdadi
 bagdadi ko aakhri baar is shahar main dekhe jane kii khabar he
 In such a situation, it is needless to say that the game over of ISIS is sure to happen as soon as Baghdadi rises to the hands of these forces or the Iraqi army, Allied or Kurdish fighters target it
 dharm na badalane par masuumon ko utaara maut ke ghatiraqi shahar mosul se chand kilometre ke faasale par maujuud he toun bartela
 In this small town of Christians, ISIS had killed hundreds of people simply because they were not ready to change their religion
 lekin ab aatankwaadiyon kii ye jyaadati gujarey kal kii baat ban chuki he
 The Iraqi army has driven out the militants from Bertella, and in such a situation the hour of the church of this ruined city has once again risen
 ek baar phir se carch main gunjane lagi ghantiyanuuparavaale ke jis ghar main ab se do saal pehle tak vachan or prarthanaaon kaa silsilaa chalata tha
 Now a military combat operation is being conducted in the same house and no one else is responsible for this situation, but the same ISIS, which has made life difficult for a large population of Iraq and Syria
 ye or baat he ki aatankwaadiyon ke khilaaphi iraqi fouj, mitra desh or kurdish fiteron ke jang kii ye wo aakhri tasviir he, jiske baad mosul ke najadik bartela ke is carch ko puri tarah se aaazaad karvaa liya gaya or puure do saal baad carch kii ghantiyaan ek baar phir prarthanaaon ke liye ghanaghna uthi
 This Christian-dominated town in Iraq, 14 kilometers from Mosul, was in possession of ISIS militants since August 2014, leaving only two options to all Christians living here
 pehla iesas kii baat maan kar dharm badal kar musalmaan ho janaa or doosraa dharm badalane se inkaar kar bemaut maaraa janaa
 Apparently, while many people died in Bertella due to the arbitrariness of ISIS, there were many people who changed their religion to stay alive under compulsion
 lekin ab jaise hi baaji palti or iraqi fouj ne is shahar se iesas ke aatankwaadiyon ko maar bhagaaya, puure toun ke saath-saath ye carch bhi gulzaar ho gaya
 After two whole years the bells of this church rang and people gathered here once again to pray
 haalanki fouj ke is last oparation main jaise hi carch kii andar kii tasviren aam hui, logon kaa man khatta ho gaya
 The church was badly ruined by the terrorists
 carch ke andar jagah-jagah nafrat ke subut bikhare the
 But the reward is that all this is now a matter of time and like other cities in Iraq, Bertella is breathing a sigh of relief
 sutron kii maane to aamane saamne kii is jang main sirf bartela main hi 80 aatankwaadiyon ko maut kii neend sula diya gaya jabaki thik bartela kii tarah hi fouj ne isaaiyon ke ek or shahar hamadaniya ko bhi ab aatankwaadiyon se aaazaad karvaa liya he
 After Iraq, the IS was raised for the first time in a small part of Parairak that extended to Syria
 phir dekhte hi dekhte ye iraq ke ek bade hisse main fail gaya
 It then crossed the Iraq border and reached neighboring Syria
 aaie aapako bataate hai ki aakhir iraq main aies kaa janm kyon or kaise hua tha? kiski vajah se hua tha or iskaa jimmedaar koun he?aise hua iesas kaa janmeek lambii ladaai ke baad america iraq ko saddaam hossain ke changul se aaazaad kara chukaa tha
 But Iraq was completely ruined during this independence and by 2011, America withdraws all its forces from the same ruined Iraq
 bagdadi ne jamaane shuru kii jadelmerica sena ke iraq chhodte hi bahut se chote-mote gut ab apni takat kii ladaai shuru kar dete hai
 One of them was Abu Bakr al Baghdadi
 al-kaayda iraq kaa chif
 It was engaged in preparing its land in Iraq since 2006
 magar tab na uske paas paise the, na koi madad or na hi ladaake
 As his name suggests, since Baghdadi was a local himself, he decided to re-establish his roots in Iraq as foreigners left Iraq
 darasal america sena 2011 main jab iraq se lautin tab tak wo iraqi sarkaar ko barbaad kar chuki thi
 Saddam was killed
 infranctrecchar puri tarah se tabah ho chuke the or sabase badi baat ye ki wo iraq main power walkyum yani khaali satta chhod gaye the
 But due to lack of resources then Baghdadi was not able to succeed much
 haalanki iraq par kabje ke liye tab tak usne al-kaayda iraq kaa naam badal kar nayaa naam rakh liya tha iesai
 That is, Islamic State of Iraq
 bagdadi ne saddaam hossain kii sena ke commander or sipaahiyon ko apane saath mila liya tha
 After this he started building the initial targets of police, military offices, checkpoints and recruitment stations
 ab tak bagdadi ke saath kai hajaar log shaamil ho chuke the
 But still Baghdadi was not getting that success in Iraq
 iraq se maayoos hokar ab bagdadi ne syria kaa rukh karne kaa faisla kiya
 Syria was experiencing civil war then
 al-kaayda or free sirian army vahaan ke do sabase bade gut the jo syrian raashtrapati se morcha le rahe the
 But even in Syria for the first four years Baghdadi did not get any major success
 alabatta is dauraan usne ek baar phir se apane sanghathan kaa naam badal kar ab iesas kar diya tha
 Islamic State of Iraq and Syria
 free sirian army ke general ne pehali baar saamne aakar duniya se apil kii thi ki agar unhen hathiyaar nahin mili to wo baagiyon se apni jang ek maheene ke andar haar jaaenge
 Within a week of this appeal, the United States, Israel, Jordan, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar started providing arms, money, and training to the Free Syrian Army
 in deshon ne baqayada saare aadhunik hathiyaar, anti tanks missile, gola-barood sab kuch syria pahunchaa diya
 And just here, the days of ISIS were reversed
 darasal jo hathiyaar free sirian army ke liye the, wo saal bhad ke andar iesas tak ja pahunche
 Because by then, IS had broken into the Free Syrian Army and many people had joined him
 saath hi syria main freedom fiter kaa nakaab pahan kar bhi aies ne duniya ko dhokhaa diya
 In the guise of this mask, even America itself inadvertently gave training to IS militants
 hathiyaaron kaa jakhira ab jamaa ho chukaa tha
 Close to 15 thousand fighters were also together
 isi ke baad june 2014 main achaanak pehali baar aies kii aisi tasviir duniya ke saamne aati he or dekhte hi dekhte ek gumnaam sanghathan agle kuch maheenon main hi duniya kaa sabase khatarnaak aatankwaadi sanghathan ban jaataa he

 Since coming into politics, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi has been consistently advocating for democracy in the Congress
 youth congress main rahul ne hi chunaav kii parampara shuru kii
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections too, elections were held on 15 seats as a pilot project to decide candidates
 sutron ke mutabik, khud rahul bhi chunaav ladakar hi congress adhyaksh bananaa chaahate hai, lekin amrutha dhawan ke istife ke baad khaali hue enesayuai adhyaksh pad ke liye rahul ke banaaye niyam-kaayade kii dhajjiyaan uda di gayi, jisaki shikaayat rahul gandhi ke darbar main pahunchi he
 According to the sources, Rahul had formed a committee under the leadership of Mukul Wasnik, who took out an advertisement for the position in the corporate style
 isamen walk in intervyuu se lekar likhit sawaal-jawaab bhi rakhe gaye
 After all this, 7 names were short-listed, the top of which is Manish Sharma
 sutron ke mutabik, manish sharma kaa naam adhyaksh pad ke liye final ho gaya, lekin rahul ne shikaayat milane ke baad philhal isaki ghoshnaa rukvaa di he
 According to sources, Rahul has received a complaint that, Manish Sharma was working in Jawahar Bhavan till recently and used to get salary
 madhya pradesh ke manish sharma jawahar bhawan main rahul kii kareebi or madhya pradesh kii purv saansad minakshi natarajan ke kareebi maane jate hai
 He was never active in NSUI, whereas, the advertisement stated that the candidate should have been active in NSUI for at least one year
 aise main sakriy logon ke saath anyaay kyon kiya ja rahaa he
 Also, questions are being raised that the date of application was 8 May, which was later extended
 dilachasp baat ye he ki, manish sharma kaa aavedan 8 may ke baad hi aayaa
 On this whole matter, Aaj Tak spoke in Rahul Gandhi's office with his close friend, then got the answer that, this is an internal matter of the party, so do not want to make any official comment on this, just can say that, this matter Rahul ji Has come to the notice of and Rahul ji will do justice
 hindi film-sangeet kii vaividhypurna chhavi ko shastreey garima dilaane main manna de (mul naam: prabodh chandra de) jaise atyant guni parshvagayak kaa naam agrani rahaa he
 When the playback singing work of Hindi cinema in its most meaningful position
 el
 The voices like Sehgal, Zohrabai Ambalawali, Ameerbai Karnatki, Rajkumari, Suraiya, Parul Ghosh, Shamshad Begum and Mukesh had created an evergreen identity
 tab aise main bengal ke apratim gayak krishna chandra de ke bhattije manna de kii gambhir or shastreey raagadari main pagi aawaaj kaa ek nayaa samay aarambh hua, jisaki pehali safal abhivyakti sachin dev burman ke sangeet nirdesan main upar gagan vishaal (mashaal, 1950) ke madhyam se paridrishy par ubhari, jiske baad to jaise gambhir, bhavapravan or shastreey gayikee ke paryaay ke rup main manna de sthapit hote chale gaye
 It is believed to be the effect of Manna Dey's amazing singing that famous playback singer Mohammad Rafi once gave this popular statement in his honor: "you all listen to my songs, whereas i only listen to Manna Dey
 ”poornachandra de or mahamaya de kii santan ke rup main manna de kaa janm kolkata main 1 may, 1919 ko hua tha
 He completed his early education from the Scottish Church School and Vidyasagar College
 apane chachaa krishna chandra de ke sahaayak ke rup main kaam karte hue unhone sangharsh ke aarambhik dinon main es
 D
 burman ke sahaayak ke rup main bhi kaam kiya tha
 His playback journey took shape through the film Tamanna from 1942, in which he sang a song Jago ai Usha, Panchi Bole Jago
 ve is arth main bhi sabase vilakshan gayak ke rup main hamaare saamne aate hai ki unhone hindi or bangla filmon main prachur maatra main gayan ke alaava punjabi, bhojpuri, magadhi, maithili, asmi, udiuya, gujarati, marathi evam konkani bhashaa kii filmon ke liye bhi pashrvagayan kiya he
 It is recorded in Manna Dey's account of honor that she proved her classicalism by singing a wonderful jugalbandi Ketki Gulab Juhi Champak Ban Phule (basant Bahar) under the direction of shankar-jaikishan along with famous singer Pandit Bhimsen Joshi of Kirana Gharana
 The information is not nineteen from this outstanding singer from anywhere
 is dharna ko unke kuch behad prachlit ekal geeton ne bhi pukhta kiya he
 If you remember, there will easily be two to four with such a rich melody of many songs, where the singularity of the vocals, the incomparable reputation of the raga and the talas and the excellent grip on the melody of the composer, all create a harmonious composition
 laagaa chunari main daag chhupaaun kaise (dil hi to he), pucho na kaise maine rain bitaai (meri surat teri ankhen), sur na saje kya gaauun main (basant bahaar), jhanak-jhanak tori baaje paayaliya (mere hujur) jaise geeton ne chitrapat sangeet kii duniya main ek bilkul anoothaa hi aswaad rachaa tha
 Unlike classical music, Manna Dey's vocals are unmatched in creating a romantic tone of love or for spreading a spark of humor or a painstaking expression of pain in the euphoria
 ve shaayad akele aise gayak the, jinase har sangeetkaar apni film ke liye kuch vishisht abhivyaktiyon evam bhav-bodhon ke liye geet rachataa tha
 For example, Aye Mere Pyare Vatan (kabuliwala), Aye Meri Zohra Jabiin (time), Kassme Vaade Pyaar Wafa (upkar), The desire to laugh has made me cry (invention), How is life like Paheli Hi (anand), Many immortal songs like Yaari Hai Iman Mera (zanjeer) can be remembered
 unki ek badi khaasiyat yah bhi rahi ki unki jodi lagbhag sabhi gayak-gayikaon ke saath ek hi str par kaamyaab dhang se ubhari
 Then she has been with fellow singers Mohammad Rafi or Kishore Kumar or with Lata Mangeshkar and Asha Bhosle; His versatility everywhere has set different standards
 aap aaj bhi unka gaaya sadabahaar comic geet ek chatur naar (padosan, kishor kumaar ke saath) ko nahin bhuule honge, na hi behad prayogdharmi geet chadh gayo paapi bichhua (madhumati, lata mangeshkar ke saath) ko
 At the same time his evergreen Prannay song Aa Jaa Sanam along with Lata will be settled in remembrance of Madhur Chandni, Hum (chori-chori), Chunri Sambhal Gori Udi Chali Jaay Re (baharon Dreams) and Dil Ki Gir Khol Do (night and Day) 
 saath hi aashaa bhonsle ke saath gaae hue utane hi madhur dogane mud-mud ke na dekh mud-mud ke (shri 420) or julfon kii gata lekar sawan kii pari ai (reshmi roomaal)
 This is to say that this unmatched music-seeker of Bengal created an original and completely different leech, which shows the shadow of Rabindra Sangeet including the effects of devotional and Kirtan music of Bengal
 unhen kai puraskaron se sammanit kiya gaya, jisamen filmphere puraskaar-1971, neshnal eword-1971, padmashri-1971, lata mangeshkar aword 1985, padmabhushan-2005 evam dada sahab phalke puraskaar-2007 shumaar hai
 Yet, as a music lover, millions of fans like me believe that his greatest prize is that he has enriched us with a legacy of such priceless songs, which have made a deep entry into the evergreen courtyard of film-music with a clear idea of classical and classical

 Upset over the 'poor' management of the election campaign of his 'celebrity' candidate Gautam Gambhir from East Delhi, the BJP leadership has tasked party vice-president Shyam Jaju to reinforce the former cricketer's debut in politics
 bijepi ko aisa lag rahaa he ki gautam gambhir ko raajnneetik prabandhan main majbootee dene kii jarurat he, tabhi vah is seat ko nikaal paaenge
 a top Bharatiya Janata Party leader said that new serious bets are learning in politics but he is more dependent on the support being received from local BJP leaders for his campaign and the support of local leaders is also not predictable
 unhone kaha, ‘jaju ko gambhir kaa chunaav prachaar abhiyaan chalaane ke liye tainaat kiya gaya he
 
 
 He took over with immediate effect by holding meetings with local party leaders and making some changes in the media team of the East Delhi candidate

 ayodhya ram janmabhumi-babarimasjidase jude 1994 ke ismail faruki maamle ko lekarsupreme courtne guuruuvaar ko apnaafaislasunaya
 The three-judge bench of the Supreme Court gave its verdict according to the majority i
e
 2-1 (opposition)
 sheersh adaalat ke do jajon ne is maamle ko badi bench ko bhejne se inkaar kar diya
 While a judge ruled in favor of sending it to the big bench
 haalanki, court ne kaha ki ayodhya maamle par 1994 ke faisle kaa koi prabhaav nahin padegaa
 After the decision of the Supreme Court, now the ownership in the Ayodhya case will be heard
 29 oktober se ye sunwaayee shuru hogi
 On the reconsideration of the Ismail Faruqui case of 1994, the Supreme Court said that the verdict was given in the cognizance of the circumstances at that time
 aise main ise badi bench ko bhejne kii koi jarurat nahin he
 After this decision of the court, it is clear that there will be no delay in hearing the Ayodhya case
 ek paksh kah rahaa tha ki is maamle kaa asar mul cese par padegaa isliye pehle is par sunwaayee honi chahie
 The hearing in this case will begin from October 29
 ayodhya maamle par 1994 ke faisle kaa nahin padegaa prabhavasupreme court ke faisle main saaf kaha he ki 1994 ke ismail faruki maamle par aae faisle kaa ayodhya ke malikana haq maamle par koi prabhaav nahin padegaa
 Earlier, Chief Justice Deepak Mishra has said that Ayodhya will look like a case of ownership of a disputed land, not on the basis of faith in the case
 iskaa saaf sanket he ki ayodhya maamle kii sunwaayee main aasthaa kii daleelein nahin chalengi, jameen ke malikana haq par faisla hoga
 Explain that in the 2010 judgment of the Lucknow bench of the Allahabad High Court, the 1994 Ismail Farooqui case was made the basis
 faisle main teen pakshon ke bich jameen baant di gai thi
 In this, two parts were given to Hindu side and one part to Muslim side
 ayodhya maamle main muslim pakshakaar moulana fajalurrahman kii ore se court main pairvi karne vaale mohammad khalid ahamed khan kehete hai ki supreme court ke aaj aae faisle ke baad hamen ye sabit nahin karnaa hoga ki islam main masjid jaruri nahin he
 In such a situation, this decision is very close to us
 court ne saaf kah diya he ki ham malikana haq par sunwaayee karenge or faisla denge
 Hindu parties have also welcomed the Supreme Court's decision today
 hanumangadhi ke mahant ne kaha ki yah aitihaasik maamla he
 All parties believe that now the ownership will be heard soon
 ab tak vivaad main uljhe ayodhya ke logon ko bhi raahat milegi
 Interestingly, now the matter related to the ownership of disputed land in Ayodhya will be heard
 guuruuvaar ko aayaa supreme court kaa faisla mandir-masjid donon par koi asar nahin daalata he
 In such a case, the party which will have solid basis of ownership, its side will be quite strong

 These proverbs fit perfectly on a municipal corporation in Delhi, the capital of the country these days, and that civic agency is none other than the East Delhi Municipal Corporation which looks after the Yamuna
 ab haalat yahaan tak aa pahunche hai ki karmchaariyon ko vetan tak ke laale pade hai
 But this MCD needs a tall wide palatial head quarters for itself, and if there is no money, then what happened is the loan option open
 kiraye ke daftar se chal rahaa he purvi emsidi kaa kaamkajalogon kii ruchi is baat main to hogi hi ki jabadillike is sabase chote nagar nigam ko bade se daftar kii jarurat mahasoos ho rahi he to aisa kyon he
 Let us tell you what is the story behind this
 lagbhag paanch saal pehle jab dilli main teen emsidi banaai gayi, do uttari or dakshini nagar nigam ko to kareeb 100 meter oonchai vaale civik centre main jagah mili, lekinpurvi nagar nigamis maamle main bhi pichad gaya
 Since there was no major office in East Delhi to run the MCD, the government gave him a rented building
 dilli sarkaar ke udyog vibhaag kaa ye building kadakadduma industrial aria main he, or ab is nagar nigam main kaam kar rahe netaaon ko yahan se kaam karnaa raas nahin aa rahaa
 Therefore, on 8 September a proposal was passed in the Standing Committee of the East Delhi Municipal Corporation and that they also want a building like Civic Center
 jiske liye paas main hi sibidi ground kii jagah bhi chun lee gai
 Where will the funds come from? It is mentioned in the proposal that the economic condition of the Eastern Municipal Corporation is very bad, so it will not be possible to raise funds on its own
 ab sarkari sansthaanon jaise kii NCRBP kaa munh taaka ja rahaa he ki vahaan se sasta lone mili or purvi dilli ke 64 nigam parshad bhi shaan bad sake

 When the AIA started investigating this sting, its roots reached Pakistan

 When the AIA was detained by the legal adviser of Hurriyat Conference president Syed Ali Shah Geelani, the AIA detained many truths
 uski baton se exie ko ye shaq hua ki ho naa ho, kashmir main aatank failaane kii ruparekha main paak ucchayog bhi shaamil ho saktaa he
 Hurriyat's anti-kashmir face opened up in the NIA investigation
 devender bahal kii maane to is puure aatanki khel kaa ek khilaadi naeem gilaani bhi he, syed ali shah gilaani kaa betaa
 Naeem Gilani was summoned to Delhi for questioning in the case of terrorist funding
 naeem gilaani kaa tikat bhi book ho gaya tha lekin ain vakt par bataaya gaya ki naeem gilaani kii tabiyat zyada bighad gai he
 Now Naeem has been placed in the ICU
 iske pehle enie ne chhapemari main saiyad ali shah gilaani kaa hastakshar kiya hua hurriyat kaa ek calendar baraamad kiya tha
 This terrorist calendar was recovered from the house of Geelani's son-in-law Altaf Funtus
 is calendar main taarikh dar taarikh kab kab kahaan-kahaan hangaamaa karnaa he, kahaan danga bhadakaana he, kahaan bavaal karana he, sab darj tha
 But Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti's stance on Hurriyat is soft
 hurriyat kaa asli cheharaa saamne aane ke baad ye tay karnaa hoga ki aatank ke in aakaaon kii dukaan hameshaa hameshaa ke liye band ho

 cricket main aisa bahut kam hi hota he jab donon opebers shunya par out ho jate hai lekin aisa world cap khel rahi team ke saath bhi ho chukaa he
 However, this has happened only three times in the World Cup
 inamen se sabase mjedaar to vah match tha jab opebers shunya par out ho gaye or aadhi team 17 ke yoga par pavilion laut chuki thi
 Yes, we are talking here about the historic match played by Team India in 1983 World Cup in which India won the match due to Kapil Dev's captaincy innings despite both the openers being dismissed for zero
 world cap kaa teesraa sanskaran chal rahaa tha or bharat ko zimbabwe ke khilaaf match khelnaa tha
 After winning the toss, captain Kapil Dev decided to bat first and his decision was proved wrong immediately as both the openers Gavaskar and Srikanth were dismissed without opening the account
 shuruaati paanch wicket 17 ranon tak out ho chuke the or 78 ke yoga tak saat wicket gir chuke the
 However what happened after that is now inscribed on the golden pages of Indian cricket history
 baharhaal yah world cap kaa aisa pehla match nahin tha jab donon hi opebers shunya par out hue hon
 For the first time in the World Cup, both the openers were out for naught, and Pakistan Openers had done this in the match between Pakistan and New Zealand played just a week before the match between India and Zimbabwe
 tab pakistani opebers mohsin khan or mudassar najar the
 Not only this, Zaheer Abbas, who came to bat after this, also started walking without opening the account and thus Pakistan's score was reduced to three wickets without opening the account
 barish se baadhit is match kaa faisla agle din hua or 239 ranon ke lakshya kaa peechha kar rahi pakistani team 186 ran banaakar ol out ho gai
 Thus Pakistan lost the match by 52 runs to New Zealand
 sirf teen baar hi hua he aisiske 16 saal baad 1999 world cap main yah mauka teesri or aakhri baar aayaa jab donon opebers shunya par hi pavilion laut gaye
 The match was between Pakistan and Scotland
 wasim akram or vakaar unuus ke saamne scotland ke donon opebers bmdablyoo patterson or iel philip apana khaataa bhi nahin khol sake
 What is the record of ODI, this record has been made only three times in the World Cup, but if we talk about One Day Records, then it has been a total of 36 times when both the openers returned to the pavilion without opening the account
 mjedaar to yah he ki jahaan pichley 15 saalon se world cap main kisi team ne yah karnama nahin kiya vahiin world cap se alag 1999 se ab tak yah record 25 baar ban chukaa he
 What is the record of Team India This has happened on four other occasions apart from the 1983 World Cup when both the openers of Team India were dismissed for zero
 1994 main westeindies ke khilaaf manoj prabhakar or sachin tendulkar, 1999 main westeindies ke khilaaf emesake prasad or sadagopan ramesh, 2001 main srilanka ke khilaaf saurav ganguli or virendra sahvaag or 2004 main zimbabwe ke khilaaf sanjay bangar or parthiv patel kii jodiyaan is record book se jud gayi

 unhone kaha, ‘‘donon deshon ke bich kaaphi kuch miltaa julata he or rishton main sudhaar laayaa janaa chahie
 The issue of Kashmir can also be resolved through dialogue
 ’’ jaswant ne kaha ki bharat or pakistan ko apane mudde aapas main hi sulajhane kaa prayaas karnaa chahie

 reliance jeeyo ne aarope lagaaya he ki airtel ke 293 or 449 rupee ke plan gumraah karne vaale tareeke se bazaar main beche ja rahe hai

 In the plan of Rs 293, unlimited calls will be available only on the Airtel network
 in planon ko kharidne vaale anya airtel graahakon ko bas 35 dino ke liye prati din 50 embi data milga

 is tarah vah apane graahakon ke bich hi bahut bhedbhaav kar rahi he

 Denying reports of differences in cabinet regarding the bill, Union Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde told reporters here, "there are some differences on legal points which have been resolved and the bill will be tabled tomorrow in a special cabinet meeting
" 
 ’ is vidheyak main mahilaon ke khilaaf hone vaale aparaadh ke liye sajaa or sakht banaayi gayi he
 The bill differs from the recently passed ordinance on at least four points
 isamen balaatkaar ko vishesh ling kendrit banane kaa praavdhaan he or ‘yon utpeedan’ shabd ko hataane kaa prastaav diya gaya he jisamen ling ke aadhaar par bhed nahin he
 If the changes were accepted, it would mean that any incident of rape would be charged only with men
 mahila adhikaar sanghathanon dwaara kii ja rahi maangon ke maddenjar yah badlaav kiye gaye hai
 Women's organizations said that the law is better than being sexually indifferent, that it should be sexually sensitive
 adhyadesh ke ek or praavdhaan ko is vidheyak ke jariye hataane kii sambhaavna he
 The ordinance provided that if an officer is found guilty of rape, he can be given a maximum life sentence
 lekin yadi vidheyak ke prastaav ko sweekaar kiya gaya to balaatkaar ke doshi adhikari ko apana ‘‘swaabhaavik jivan’’ jail main hi gujaarna hoga
 The meaning of officer is also explained in the Bill
 iske tahat police yaa sashastr balon ke adhikari yaa doctor yaa kisi aspataal ke karmchaaree, jailer yaa remand home ke warden aaenge
 The new proposal has made it necessary for all government and private hospitals in the country to provide free medical treatment to women who have become victims of any form of sexual violence
 aspataalon yaa aisi hi sansthaaon ko police kaa intjaar nahin karnaa he
 They can start treatment soon after informing the police
 inase inkaar karnaa aparaadh hoga jiske liye ek saal tak kii sajaa ho sakati he

 Vatavriksha is worshiped for unbroken good fortune and healing

 At the end of the Holocaust itself on the leaves of Akshayavat, Lord Krishna appeared to Markandeya
 devi savitri bhi vatvriksh main nivas karti hai
 Akshayavat situated on the banks of the Ganges in Prayag has been called by Tulsidas ji as 'chhatraraj ki Chhatra'
 vatvriksh ke neeche savitri ne apane pati ko pun: jivit kiya tha
 Since then, this fast is known as 'vat Savitri'
 isamen vatvriksh kii puja kii jaati he
 Women observe this fast for Akhand good luck and family prosperity
 vrath kii parikrama karte samay 108 baar soot lapeta jaataa he
 The women listen to the story of savitri-satyavan
 savitri kii katha ko sunne se manorath purna hote hai or vipadaa dur hoti he
 Vat Savitri Vrat Katha: a religious king named Ashwapati used to rule in Madras
 unke santan nahin thi
 The king made a sacrifice for the child
 kuch samay baad unhen ek kanya kii prapti hui
 He named her Savitri
 vivaah yogya hone par savitri ko var khojane ke liye kaha gaya to usne dyumtsen ke putr satyawan ko patirup main varan kiya
 When Narada came to know about this, he said to King Ashwapati that Satyavan is a young man
 ek varsh baad hi unki mrityu ho jaaegi
 Hearing Narada ji, he explained to the daughter, but Savitri was determined to get Satyavan as her husband
 savitri ke drudh rahane par aakhir raja ashwapati ne savitri or satyawan kaa vivaah kar diya
 Savitri continued to serve her mother-in-law and husband
 naarad ji ne mrityu kaa jo din bataaya tha, us din savitri bhi satyawan ke saath van ko chali gai
 As Satyavan started climbing the tree in the forest, his head started suffering unbearable pain
 vah savitri kii god main apana sir rakhkar let gaya
 After a while, Savitri saw that Yamraj is standing with many messengers in his hands
 yamraj satyawan ke angupraman jeev ko lekar dakshin disha kii ore chal die
 Seeing Savitri coming, Yamraj said, 'O husband! As far as man can support, you have supported your husband
 ab tum laut jaao
 Savitri said, 'I should go as far as my husband goes
 yahi sanathan satya he
 Yamraj heard Savitri's pious voice and asked for a bride
 savitri ne kaha, ‘mere saas-sasur andhe hai, unhen netra-jyoti den
 Saying 'yamraj' and 'aastru', he asked her to return, but Savitri followed Yama in the same way
 yamraj ne usase pun: var maangane ko kaha
 Savitri asked for the groom, 'may he get back the lost kingdom of my father-in-law
 ’ yamraj ne ‘tathastu’ kahkar use laut jane ko kaha, parantu savitri adig rahi
 Seeing Savitri's husband devotion and loyalty, Yamraj melted
 unhone ek or var maangane ke liye kaha
 Savitri then asked, 'I want to be the mother of Satyavan's sons
 krupa kar aap mujhe yah vardaan den
 Pleased with Savitri's devotion, while giving this final boon, Yamraj freed Satyavan from the loop and disappeared
 savitri ab usee vat vriksh ke paas ai
 The creature was infused in the dead body of Satyavan lying under the tree and he got up and sat down
 satyawan ke mata-pita kii ankhen thik ho gayi or khoyaa hua rajya waapas mil gaya

 Significantly, this school expelled Ruchika on the grounds of not depositing fees

 Lakhanpal has alleged in the PIL, "when this girl was crying, the school expelled her on the trivial basis of not paying fees instead of supporting her
" ’’lakhanpal ne aarope lagaaya he, ‘‘ruchika ko aatmahatya tak pahunchane vaali paristhitiyon ke liye yah skool bhi anya logon ke baraabar jimmedaar he, jin paristhitiyon kii vajah se ruchika ne apane utpeedan ke teen saal baad aatmahatya kar lee
 He also alleged that the school, under pressure from Rathore, might have acted against Ruchika, Rathore's daughter also studied in her own class

 The army had earlier said that five to seven Pakistani intruders were killed when it foiled the efforts of the Pakistani bat squad
 pakistan border ection team (BAT) main aam taur par pakistani sena ke vishesh bal ke karmi or aatanki hote hai
 Sources said that at least four bodies were seen near the Indian post in the sector
 ye shav pakistan sena ke special sarvice group (esasji) ke commando yaa aatankiyon ke ho sakate hai
 The principal secretary and director general of police of Uttar Pradesh home department was removed from the post amid demands from opposition parties
 aadhikarik sutron ne bataaya ki grih vibhaag ke pramukh sachiv kunwar fateh bahadur or police mahanideshak brijlaal ko pad se hataa diya gaya he
 It is worth noting that various opposition parties had accused the Election Commission of acting as an agent of the ruling Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) of these officials and said that these officers should be able to conduct the upcoming assembly elections in the state in an independent and impartial manner
 It is necessary to remove
 tippaniyan Earlier, Bahujan Samaj Party general secretary Satish Chandra Mishra, in a press conference held late Saturday, claimed that Fateh Bahadur and Brijlal were removed by the Election Commission, terming it unfair
 mishra ne chunaav aachaar samhita ke maddenjar rajya main jagah-jagah lagi mukhyamantri mayawati or bispi ke chunaav nishaan hathi kii murtiyon ko dhakne ke nirvachan ayog ke aadesh ko ekatarfa qaraar dete hue us par sawaal bhi uthaae
 It is noteworthy that amidst strong demand from the opposition parties, the Election Commission has put the election mark of Bahujan Samaj Party with elephant money and the statues of Chief Minister Mayawati at various places in the state in view of the election code of conduct applicable in view of Uttar Pradesh assembly elections
 Gave countries to cover

 Mishra also questioned the Election Commission order unilaterally covering the statues of Chief Minister Mayawati and bsp's election trail elephant in the state in view of Election Code of Conduct
 ullekhneey he ki vipakshi dalon kii purajor maang ke bich nirvachan ayog ne uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaav ke drushtigat lagu chunaav aachaar samhita ke maddenjar rajya main vibhinn sthanon par sarkari dhan se lagaai gai bahujan samaaj party ke chunaav nishaan hathi tathaa party pramukh mukhyamantri mayawati kii murtiyon ko dhakne ke aadesh die
 It is noteworthy that amidst the strong demand from opposition parties, the Election Commission has given the election mark of Bahujan Samaj Party with elephant money and statues of party chief Chief Minister Mayawati at various places in the state in view of the election code of conduct applicable in view of Uttar Pradesh assembly elections

 babari vidhwans maamle main bijepi ke varisht netaa laalkrishna adwani samet 13 netaaon par phir se aapraadhik sajeesh kaa maamla chal saktaa he
 The Supreme Court gave the indication that they cannot be relieved on mere technical ground

 The court asked the CBI to file a supplementary charge sheet of criminal conspiracy against all the 13 accused in the case
 supreme court ne kaha ki babari vidhwans maamle main do alag-alag adaalaton main chal rahi sunwaayee ek jagah hi kyon na ho?tippaniyan The court asked why the second case related to the ongoing Babri Masjid in Rae Bareli should not be transferred to Lucknow, where the hearing in a related matter is already going on
 court ne yah bhi kaha ki donon maamalon ko ek saath suna janaa chahie
 At the same time, it was opposed by LK Advani and it was said that in this case 183 witnesses will have to be called again which is quite difficult
 court ko sajeesh ke maamle kii dobaaraa sunwaayee ke aadesh nahin dene chahie
 At the same time, the CBI said that it is ready for trial of both the cases together
 haalanki supreme court ne maamle kii antim sunwaayee 22 march ko rakhi he
 In the Babri demolition case, the Supreme Court is hearing the case of former UP Chief Minister Kalyan Singh, LK Advani, Murali Manohar Joshi, Uma Bharti and other leaders of BJP, VHP, for the removal of charges of criminal conspiracy

 The CBI said in an affidavit that the policy-making process of the CBI is completely independent

 There is no question of any person, body or institution being affected by the cbi's policy making process or its way of fighting the case in the courts
 court ne poocha ki raibareli main chal rahe babari masjid se jude duusare maamle kii sunwaayee ko kyon na lakhanu transfar kar diya jaae, jahaan isi se jude ek maamle kii sunwaayee pehle se hi chal rahi he
 The court also said that the two cases should be heard together
 vahiin laalkrishna adwani kii ore se iskaa virodh kiya gaya or kaha gaya ki is maamle main 183 gavaahon ko phir se bulaanaa padegaa jo kaaphi mushkil he
 The court should not order a re-hearing of the conspiracy case
 vahiin sibiai ne kaha ki vah donon maamalon kaa saath trial ke liye taiyaar he
 However, the Supreme Court has given the final hearing of the case on 22 March
 babari vidhwans maamle main upi ke purv mukhyamantri kalyaan singh, laalkrishna adwani, murali manohar joshi, uma bharti or bijepi, vihip ke anya netaaon par se aapraadhik sajeesh rachane ke aarope hataae jane ke maamle main supreme court sunwaayee kar rahaa he

 hoicourt ne vishesh adaalat ke faisle kii pushti karte hue bhartiya dand samhita kii dhara 120bi (aapraadhik sajeesh) hataa diya tha
 In September last year, the CBI had told the apex court that its policy-making process was not affected by anyone and the action to remove the charges of criminal conspiracy by senior BJP leaders was not taken at his (agency's) behest
 sibiai ne ek halafname main kaha tha ki sibiai kii niti nirdhaaran prakriya puri tarah swatantra he
 All decisions are made on the basis of correct facts in the light of current law
 kisi shaks, nikaay yaa sanstha se sibiai kii niti nirdhaaran prakriya ke prabhavit hone yaa adaalaton main maamla ladane ke uske tareeke ke prabhavit hone kaa koi sawaal nahin he

 Before the World Cup, champion batsman Sachin Tendulkar has given some tips to the batsmen, describing the success of their success on challenging pitches in Australia and New Zealand
 cricket ke itihaas ke sabase safal ballebaajon main se ek tendulkar ne 1992 se 2011 tak chah vishwa cap khele
 He first played the World Cup in 1992
 unhone isisi ke liye vishwa cap ke apane kollam main likhaa, perth or bristben main tej or uchhaalbhari pichen hai, jin par anubhavheenata kii kalai khul jaaegi
 There will be no scope for mistake for bowlers and batsmen
 ballebaaj agar teji or oochaal ko samajhate hai to gendbaajon par haaavee ho sakate hai
 He said, bowlers will have to put a good length ball on these pitches as batsmen can take advantage if they miss it
 yadi aap acchhee langth kii gend daalkar oochaal kaa phayda uthaate hai to ballebaajon ke liye sankat paidaa ho jayega
 Tendulkar, who said goodbye to international cricket in November 2013, said that batsmen have to be careful with the strong winds blowing in New Zealand
 unhone kaha, newjiland main ballebaaj ko tej hawaaon se saavdhaan rahanaa hoga
 The winds are so strong that the timing of the batsman can be affected
 vishwa cap main 45 maichon main sarvaadhik 2278 ran bana chuke tendulkar ne 2011 main nau maichon main 482 ran banaae the
 Tendulkar said, New Zealand grounds are not traditionally round
 australia main adelaide ovel kii boundry point or square leg par choti he, lekin street boundry kaaphi lambii he
 This will be a big difference for the visiting team as it will affect the field positions and bowling strategies
 unhone kaha, australia ke bade maidaanon par boundry bhi badi he
 i remember that the 1999 series used to be full boundary
 maine boundry se riki ponting ke thro par chauthaa ran dauda tha
 Despite the throw thrown by Ricky's strong arms, we ran four runs because we knew it would take time for the ball to reach the wicketkeeper
 unhone kaha, kharaab farm se jujh rahe khilaadiyon ke liye sarkal main atirikt fielder chunauteepurn hoga kyonki strike rotate karnaa kathin hoga
 On the other hand, if two in-form batsmen are at the crease, then the bowler will have a crisis

 samjhauta blast cese ke aaropee aresas netaa indresh kumaar kaa kahana he ki aatanki gatividhiyon main giraftaar sabhi hinduon ko maamle kii jaanch puri hone tak jamaanat milani chahie
 There is a demand from his Modi government that among other issues it should also get priority
 indresh kumaar ne ye baaten angreji akhbaar 'hindustan times' se kahin
 Let me tell you that senior leader of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh Indresh Kumar is accused of being involved in terrorist activities
 sibiai or enie ne unke khilaaf jaanch bhi kii
 But due to lack of sufficient evidence, the NIA has now decided not to interrogate him further
 enie dwaara aage poochtacha nahin kiye jane kii khabar par unhone kaha, 'main pehle din se kahata aa rahaa hum ki congress nit upie sarkaar sajeesh ke tahat aresas or uske kuch padaadhikariyon ko fansaane kii koshish kar rahi thi
 The previous government and some leaders jointly hatched this conspiracy
 isamen congress netritv bhi shaamil tha
 He used investigative agencies to his advantage
 haalanki, vah kaamyaab nahin ho sake
 He committed the sin and crime of defaming saffron, Hindu and Sangh
 shaayad isi kaaran se chunaavon main unki durgati hui
 The UPA government first used the ATS, then the CBI and finally the NIA for its political gains
 'unhone aage kaha, 'kai aise log pichley teen-chah saal se jail main band hai, jinka naam chargeshit main bhi nahin he
 Talking about human rights and giving justice to all, many have received very big punishment for any mistake
 aaj kii taarikh main kam se kam jaanch agency yah to kar sakati he ki sunwaayee puure hone tak unhen bel diya jaae
 The image of innocents and patriots became like criminals and terrorists, a result of the previous government's conspiracy
 vakt aa chukaa he ki unhen is chhavi se chhutkaaraa mili
 Indresh Kumar said, "keeping saffron terrorists in jail would be an injustice to them
" unhen jald se jald nyaay milanaa chahie
 The NIA and the government should take necessary steps to get them out of jail
 maamle kii sunwaayee jari rahegi
 If Muslims can get bail on this basis because they are Muslims, then the NIA should at least arrange their bail
 enie ko himmat dikhaane kii jarurat he
 i hope he does his job
 'unhone modi sarkaar se maang kii, 'mujhe pataa he ki narendra modi ke netritv sarkaar kii kai praathamiktaayen hai par yah maamla bhi us list kaa hissaa hona chahie
 ' bhartiya rigerv bank (RBI) epadiai, growth rate or aarthik bhavishyavaanee se itar is baar kisaanon kii vakaalat karata najar aa rahaa he
 The RBI was troubled by the increasing farmer suicides and Deputy Governor HR Khan expressed deep concern on the issue from RBI
 kya kaha RBI ne?rbi ke dipti governor ech aar khan ne kisaanon kii aatmahatya ko rokane ke liye bade kadam uthaane kii vakaalat kii or apni baat ko aage badhaate hue kaha ki in aatmahatyaon ke liye sirf bhari rin hi akelaa kaaran nahin hai
 Khan does not consider loan waiver as an appropriate step
 unhone kaha kii karj maafee se behatar kai upaay hai unpar vichaar karne kii jarurat he
 Though he rightly expressed a debt waiver for some of the disputes, above all, he said to strengthen better management so that any such situation can be avoided
 gajendra singh rathod ko kiya yaddilli kii aam aadmi party kii ek raily main aatmahatya karne vaale kisaan gajendra singh rathod kii yaad dipti governor khan ko bhi ai
 Khan said that Kigjendra's suicide is an open testimony to the problems of the farmers
 khan ne aage kaha ki yah dukhad ghatana bataati hai ki aazaadee ke 60 saal baad bhi desh main kisno kii samasyaayein jas kii tas bani hui hai
 Khan stressed that there is a need for structural changes in agriculture

 Where did my column come from? The column i wrote for my Friday Times newspaper became very famous
 darasal pehle kuch or likhti thi
 The editor was instructed to write on the subject subject in light tone
 par phir main bor ho gai
 i said, no longer happens
 editor bolaa, tumhaare reader niraash honge
 Do something new main us din lahore main ek party main gai
 Party Hi Fi and i Little Shai
 do antee ji baat kar rahi thim
 She would talk and sometimes shake her hair, jerk it and then touch her diamond necklace while returning
 phir ek boleen
 You know, this is a shawl from mahtush (a very expensive type of cloth)
 puure saat yard kaa
 i had two or three
 phir sochaa ek or le luun
 Say so much aunt takes poses
 phir puuchhati hai
 How many do you have duusari bolti hai
 i do not have any main shawl pahenti hi nahin
 a very med (maid) type feel comes
 ye baatcheet mere jehan main atak gai
 Based on this, i wrote my new first column
 editor bole, chalegaa nahin
 Went on jab chal gaya to chahakakar bole, maine kamishan kiya tha
 The leaders of Pakistan, the leader who comes to power here, knows that he has a full five years to build
 hamaare yahaan har vakt dar rahata he
 i do not know when General Sahab will come
 to har koi hadabadi main rahata he
 The sooner you make, the more paradise you get
 meri khwaahish
 
 
 Leaders of both countries meet, officers meet
 log nahin milte
 If people meet, a lot of misconceptions should be cleared from both sides
 sabko bahut chaah he, utsukata he
 We do not want middlemen
 lahore lit fest main bhartiya lekhakon ke seshan ke liye bheed lagati thi
 Our businessmen are very keen on friendship with India
 kai enjio bhi apane str par prayaas kar rahe hai
 My book is the best selling in India
 bharat se dushmani kaa phayda kisepakistan bharat kaa dushman bana rahe, is soch or sach se sabase zyada phayda sena ko he
 Their basis and existence is from this only
 isi se unako takat milti he
 And finally a funny kissakaveri asked the question
 wo peedi biit rahi he, jiske paas partishan kii, uske pehle kii, saajhaapan kii yaaden thim
 Shobha shouted at Hami
 magar moni boleen
 No, it is wrong that the youth has forgotten the partition
 phir unhone kissa sunaaya
 She went to the hotel salon in the morning before coming to the program
 ladki ne achche se bal sanvarna shuru kiya
 Then stopped and asked
 madam, partishan kis taraf rakhana he
 Shobhaa Dey also gets upset at the leaders coming to a full-fledged Mumbai
 kyonki ye shahar sirf film staron or bhayanak amir logon ko hi kuch izzat detaa he
 So when Delhi leaders come to a party in Mumbai
 to unhen lagata he ki afra tafari much jaaegi
 Everyone will get involved in Hujuri
 par koi dekhtaa bhi nahin
 So soon the leaders' ego gets a terrible hurt
 ve pet dard kaa bahaanaa kar khisak lete hai

 Bahujan Republican Party- Bahujan Mahasangh (BBM) leader Prakash Ambedkar and Asaduddin Owaisi's party All India majlis-e-ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) have joined hands
 prakaash or ovaisi mangalvaar ko gandhi jayanti ke maukey par marathavada ilaake ke aurangabad main saajha raily kar rahe hai
 The two leaders are believed to have decided to come together to stop the scattering of Dalit and Muslim slaves
 bataa den ki maharashtra main 17 percent dalit or 13 fisadi muslim aabaadi he
 a large number of Muslims live in Aurangabad, Beed, Nanded and Osmanabad
 iske alaava parbhani, latur, jaalnaa or hingoli jaise jilon main bhi muslim matadaata nirnaayak bhoomika main hai
 Whereas Dalit community areas fall in Aurangabad, Beed, Latur, Osmanabad and Nanded

 Prakash Ambedkar's political base is believed to be in and around Akola district of Vidarbha region

 upi vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan unhone basapa ke sathgathabandhanaki koshish kii thi, lekin mayawati ne unhen bahut zyada tavajjo nahin di
 But now Owaisi may get a chance to increase political ground in Maharashtra, where he has the support of BBM leader Prakash Ambedkar
 maharashtra kaa siyaasi mizaaj upi or bihar jaisaa nahin rahaa he
 In such a situation, there are many questions about whether muslim-dalits will come together in the state
 haalanki, is gathjod se bijepi se zyada congress or ensipi jaise dalon kii bechaini bad gai he, kyonki donon partiyon kaa aadhaar bhi muslim or dalit samudaay main he
 Leaders of both the parties are calling this new alliance as 'bjp's b team'
 soobe kii raajnneeti par najar rakhane vaale bhi is gathjod ko 'vot kaatane vaali mashin' maan rahe hai
 It is clear that BJP or Shiv Sena will get the benefit of their vote cut
 haalanki AIMIM ke aurangabad se vidhayak imtiyaaj jaleel in charchaaon ko khaarij karte hai
 He says, 'congress and NCP have consistently failed to do anything for the Muslims of the state
 ham in dalon kii bhi utani hi mukhaalafat karte rahe hai, jitani kii bijepi or shivasena kii
 'let us tell you that in Maharashtra, BJP and Shiv Sena will fight separate elections
 vahiin, congress or ensipi 2019 main ek baar phir saath milakar chunaav ladane kii ghoshnaa kar chuke hai
 In such a situation, the new alliance of Owaisi and Prakash Ambedkar in the state can change the political equations

 Thanks to the audience
 " film 'piku' ke abhinayta ne kaha ki 'vajeer' kii chaal somvaar kii tulana main pehle din se adhik he
 The story of the film 'wazir' is based on the story of two unusual friends
 rajdhani dilli main yun to siyaasi ladaai emsidi chunaav ko lekar ho rahi he
 On one hand, BJP has opened a front, while Kejriwal, who holds the Delhi government, has given the slogan of EVM responsible if the people decide and lose
 in sabake bich congress bhi apana siyaasi bhavishya talash rahi he
 If all the leaders who are angry with Ajay Maken are to be considered, then if the Congress does not come to number two like the assembly elections in Rajya Garden between the BJP and Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party, then it is going to stand
 purv siem shila dikshit camp ke tamaam netaa ajay maakan se naaraaz hai
 Today is the night when perhaps the Congressmen will not sleep whether they will win or win
 unako sukun is baat par aayega ki, kya vah number do par aaenge
 If not, then Sheila Camp will be an attacker on Rahul's favorite Ajay Maken, who considers himself Rahul Gandhi in Delhi
 kai naaraaz netaaon ne chodi partiajay maakan par sandip dikshit kaa aarope he ki vah dilli congress ko apni jeb se chalaate hai, jaise congress ko rahul apane hisaab se chalaate hai
 Ajay Maken calls himself Rahul Gandhi in Delhi Congress
 naaraazgi kaa alam dekhie ki shila sarkaar main mantri arvinder singh lavali, dilli pradesh ke youth congress ke adhyaksh amit malik, dilli mahila congress kii adhyaksh barkhaa shukla singh, dilli ke purv vidhayak amrish gautam ajay maakan kii kaaryastylee se naaraaz hokar congress chhodbijepi menshamil ho gaye
 Perhaps this is why Sheela in a conversation with Aaj Tak said that the vote in the MCD will fall in the name of Congress and not on Maken's name
 to sandip ne kaha ki congress 15 saal ke shila sarkaar ke naam par vot maang rahi he
 Maken is timid, boisterous, fickle and low minded
 lagata he unka netritv thopa gaya he
 The allegations on Ajay Maken do not end here
 samasya yah he ki sabhi kehete hai ki maakan kisi kaa phone nahin uthaate, line par nahin aate
 Opponents say that Maken does not want to improve the relationship, he wants those who are against him to leave the Congress
 isse congress par kabja sirf maakan kaa rah jaae, ye fehrist bahut lambii he
 Senior leader AK Walia, who plays an important role in Sheila government, is angry, other senior Yogananda Shastri is also angry, Mangatram Singal is also angry
 harun yusuf naakhush hai to parvej hashmi bhi chupchaap baithe hai
 Sources reveal that Ajay Maken has marginalized the long list of Delhi Pradesh Congress leaders by keeping Rahul Gandhi with him
 maakan ko rahul gandhi kaa saharasath hi kamalnath ahamed patel mukul vaasanic auskar furnandis jaise netaaon ko bhi tikat bantwaare main thenga dikhaa diya
 Now everyone is waiting for the result of MCD election and Maken has the support of Rahul Gandhi
 sachai yahi he ki agar emsidi main congress haari to kya rahul maakan ko jimmedaar maanenge yaa phir rahul yah maan lenge ki maakan ne mehnat kii, koshish kii par maahaul thik nahin tha, isliye congress haar gai
 Opponents of Congress stalwarts waiting for the election results say that when the matter progresses, the talk of central leaders will be a problem for Maken
 isliye sabhi ko intjaar he emsidi chunaav ke parinaamon kaa
 After that, the future of Ajay Maken, close to Rahul Gandhi, will be decided, although the old Congressman says that Rahul does not decide responsibility, does not determine accountability
 vah kisi ko apana saathi banaate hai or agar vah galati karata he to usko kisi ek mahatvapurn jagah se hataakar duusari mahatvapurn jagah par pahunchaa dete hai
 It is being speculated that if Maken will perform poorly in the MCD, he will be removed from the post of Delhi State President and will be made the National General Secretary of the Congress
 ab awaz uthegi ki rahul gandhi javabdehi tay nahin kar paa rahe hai or congress chauraahey par khadi he, rasta talash rahi he
 The teacher who has the responsibility of grooming the future of children, what to say when he becomes irresponsible
 chhattisgarh ke korea jile main ek shikshak nashe hi haalat main bacchon ko padhaata paaya gaya
 The special thing is that the teacher was able to teach primary school students 'daru' for the letter 'D' and 'pio' for the letter 'P' on the black board
 pehle bhi nashe main aata rahaa he schulkoria jile ke sarkari praathmik vidhyalay main saamne aae is maamle main shivabaran naam kaa yah teacher class main blikeboard par daaru or piyo shabd likhte hue dikhaa
 He also confessed that he was drunk and had come to school after drinking alcohol many times before
 baad main maangi maafeehalanki, baad main use jab kuch samaj main aayaa to uske hosh ud gayi
 He apologized for being drunk
 usne kaha ki 'main kaaphi pehle sharaab pinaa chhod chukaa hum
 i confess my mistake
 or ab kabhi bhi nashe main skool aakar bacchon ko nahin padhaaungaa
 'the administration assured the action
 However, the district administration of Korea said that it will get the matter investigated and action will be taken against the teacher
 jila colector sanjeev jha ne kaha- 'kisi sarkari karmchaaree kaa sharaab pikar kaam par janaa adarsh vyavhaar ke khilaaf he, khaskar kisi shikshak ke liye
 If the said teacher has done so, we will investigate the matter and take strict action against him

 isse pehle kejariwal sarkaar main hi swasthya mantri satyendra jain ne bhi is tarah kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 Taking a direct target on the central government, Sisodia said that due to his personal enmity, PM Modi is doing politics with the pride of the country

 Sisodia said that i had to present the education model of Delhi there
 agar main dilli kaa shiksha model vahaan rakhuunga to main bharat ko hi prastut karuunga
 But Modi ji's hatred for the Delhi government is such that he is not allowing me to go to Austria by keeping the country's honor, his hatred towards the Aam Aadmi Party and his members as paramount
 unhone kaha ki modi ji kaa mantralay mujhe videsh jane kii anumati nahin de rahaa, taaki main vahaan jaakar bharat kaa shiksha model duniya ke saamne rakh sakuun or desh kaa gaurav badha sakuun

 china kii sena ne guuruuvaar ko pehali baar pichley saal ladakh kshetra kii depasang ghati main atikaraman karne kii baat kabool kii or kaha ki aisi ghatnaayen vaastavik niyantran rekha ke bare main alag-alag dharanaon kii vajah se huin
 Defense Ministry spokesman Colonel Geng Yansheng said, 'there was some incident in the border area last year
 saare mudde baatcheet ke jariye uchit dhang se hal kar liye gaye
 However, he did not name the Depsang Valley where the People's Liberation Army (PLA) troops had formed camps in April last year to assert their control over the area
 pravaktaa ne yahaan samvaadadaata sammelan main ek sawaal kaa jawaab dete hue kaha, 'seemaa rekha kaa nirdhaaran nahin he or donon paksh kii vaastavik niyantran rekha ko lekar alag-alag vyakhyaayein hai
 'at this press conference, some foreign media was allowed to come and this happened for the first time in the history of the Chinese Army
 geng ne kaha ki videshi media ko china or chini sena kii behatar tathaa zyada vastuparak samaj ke liye bulaayaa gaya tha
 Prior to Chinese Prime Minister Li Qing's visit to India in May last year, China had encroached in the Depsang Valley following which military and diplomatic tensions arose
 kai daur kii baatcheet ke baad yah mudda sulajhaa tha or chini sainik waapas chale gaye the
 It is the first time the Chinese army has mentioned the Depsang incident, but has not yet explained why Chinese soldiers did it before Li's visit
 pradhanmantri banane ke baad lee kii vah pehali bharat yatra thi
 This month, there were several incidents in Ladakh region which were resolved amicably
 pravaktaa ne kaha, 'donon sarkarein seemaa kshetra main vivaadon ko hal karne par ahm sahmati par pahunchi hai
 He cited the Border Defense Cooperation Agreement that was signed last year to resolve intensive patrols in the disputed area
 pichley aktubar main donon pakshon ne is par hastakshar kiye jisamen ek duusare ke viruddh sainya kshamta kaa istemaal nahin karne or vishwaas bahaali ke upaay prastaavit kiye gaye the
 Both sides are trying to implement BDCA
 pulavama main aatanki hamale main 40 CRPF javaanon ke shahid ho jane ke baad bharat ne pakistan se most faverd nesan kaa darja chin kar yah kadaa sandesh diya he ki ab bahut ho chukaa
 The government has also summoned the Pakistan High Commissioner in Delhi
 bharat iske alaava aatankiyon or pakistan ko sabak sikhaane ke liye kai kade kadam uthaane par vichaar kar rahaa he
 Let us know what steps India can take from extreme to extreme
 haalanki inamen se kai aise vikalp hai jinhen apnaanaa bahut kathin he
 1- MFN status is over, now complete business relationship India has abolished the Most Favored Nation (MFN) status of Pakistan after Pulwama attack
 isse pakistan ko bharat se vyapaar main milane vaali sahuliyatein khatm ho jaaengi
 But India has not closed all trade relations with Pakistan
 to ek charam kadam yah ho saktaa he ki pakistan se kaarobaari rishta puri tarah se khatm kar diya jaae
 This step can be taken because the trade from India to Pakistan is only about Rs 16,000 crore
 iskaa bahut nuksaan nahin hoga or isaki bharpai anya deshon ke saath kaarobaar se kii ja sakati he
 2- End Cultural Relations: An extreme step may be to stop cultural and people-to-person relations between Pakistan and India
 iske tahat pakistan main bhartiya kalakaaron, filmon, serial ke jane or bharat main pakistani kalakaaron, movie, serial kaa aane par roak lagaai ja sakati he
 Apart from this, the movement of people can be stopped by prohibiting train, bus, air travel etc
 yah charam kadam to sambhav he, lekin ise kaaphi amanviya mana ja saktaa he
 There are many people in India and Pakistan who have kinship
 kisi kaa bhai pakistan main he to kisi ke chachaa hindustan main hai
 Such people will be very difficult to ban all relations
 3- aatankwaadi desh ghoshit kar pakistan kii qamar tod dobharat apni taraf se pakistan ko aatanki raashtra ghoshit kar saktaa he
 With this, there will be pressure on the international community to declare Pakistan a terrorist country
 iske baad yadi bharat ne achche se apane rajanyik card khele to vah pakistan ko kaaphi mushkil main daal saktaa he
 Talk to all the countries to isolate Pakistan at the international level and expose the terror face of Pakistan in front of India and the world
 antarrashtriya str par apana dabaav banaakar bharat duusare deshon ke dwaara pakistan par kai tarah ke pratibandh lagava saktaa he
 Pakistan's foreign funding may be banned
 yahi nahin, bharat bahurashtriya companiyon ke saamne yah shart rakh saktaa he ki agar unhen bharat main apana kaarobaar karnaa he to pakistan ke saath kaarobaar band karen
 That is, they have to choose between India and Pakistan
 khaskar khadi deshon ko is baat ke liye manaaya ja saktaa he ki ve pakistan par kai tarah ke aarthik pratibandh lagaaein
 If this can be done, then Pakistan will be breaking its back, already facing economic difficulties
 4- phir sargical strikeuri hamale ke jawaab main bharat ne jis tarah saal 2016 main sargical strike kiya tha, ab usase bada sargical strike kar pioke ke aatanki addon ko puri tarah se khatm karne kaa kadam uthaaya ja saktaa he
 Apart from the way that the US SEAL commandos entered Osama and killed Osama, in the same way Indian Jambaz commandos can enter Pakistan and eliminate terrorist leaders like Hafiz Saeed, Masood Azhar
 haalanki yah kadam bhi itnaa aasaan nahin he, kyonki is baar pakistan sachet he
 5- Abolition of Article 370 and 35A BJP itself has been demanding for abolition of Article 370 of the Constitution for a long time
 is baar yah mauka he ki bijepi sarkaar is maamle main kuch kare
 It would also be an extreme step to eliminate sections 370 and 35A applicable to Kashmir and gain full Indian government control there
 isse vahaan par har tarah kii karrwai sarkaar ke liye sambhav hogi or sarkaar chaahe to desh ke anya hisson ke logon ko vahaan basaa kar jansankhya dhaanche main bhi badlaav laayaa ja saktaa he
 But this option is also not easy, because the process of amending the constitution is very difficult, secondly, the people of Kashmir can stand against the rest of India and the Government of India
 6- pakistan par sidhaa hamalajawaanon kii shahadat se gusse main aae tamaam bhartiya aise tark de rahe hai ki pakistan par sidhaa hamalaa kar use 1947 or 1965 jaisaa sabak dena chahie
 Although India has never attacked before, but now because of terrorism becoming a cancer, people argue that India should end this game by attacking once
 haalanki yah antim or behad charam kadam hoga
 The war in India and Pakistan can disturb the peace of the whole world
 donon desh parmaanu sampann hai
 Therefore, both countries will suffer a lot of loss of public money in this war
 aise main is tarah ke hamale kii baat vyaavhaarik nahin lagati
 The second thing is that both countries will suffer more in such an attack
 hajaaron, lakhon kii sankhya main logon kii jaane ja sakati hai
 In such a situation, this bet can backfire, because then the same people would say that the government killed thousands to avenge the martyrdom of 40 people
 7- band kar do paneepakistan ko sabak sikhaane kaa ek tarika yah bhi he ki bharat sindhu, jhelum jaisi pakistan tak jane vaali nadiyon kaa pani roak de
 The thinking behind this is that when the pok or the people of Pakistan are going to love the waters of the rivers, the Government of Pakistan will get a lesson and will be forced to destroy the terrorist bases of their home
 haalanki, is kadam main ek badi aadchan yah he ki bharat ne pakistan ke saath nadi jal saajhedaari ko lekar kai samjhaute kiye hai or pakistan is masale ko lekar antarrashtriya panchat main pahonchega, jisase yah masalaa mukademebaaji main ulajh jayega
 Apart from this, there is a fear that the water of many major rivers in India comes from China, so if the Chinese take any such step in support of their friend Pakistan, then the Indian public will have problems
 8- kashmir main aatankiyon ko chun-chun kar marodesh ke bheetar kii jane vaali karrwai main se ek tarika yah ho saktaa he ki sarkaar kashmir se aatank kaa usee tarah se khaatmaa kare, jis tarah se punjab main indira gandhi or capies gil ke daur main kiya gaya tha
 Militants can be searched and killed selectively in every village by deploying lakhs of soldiers in areas considered to be strongholds of terrorism in Kashmir
 aatankiyon kii funding network ko nestnabud karnaa hoga
 The goal of this campaign could be the complete elimination of terrorists from Kashmir
 iske alaava in aatankiyon ke samarthak algaavvaadiyon ko kaabo main rakhane kaa tarika yah ho saktaa he ki unhen kashmir ke baahar desh kii anya jelon main band kar diya jaae
 9 - Stop playing with Pakistan, not just cricket but India can ban their side from being involved in any tournament or match in all kinds of sports
 bharat yah bhi kah saktaa he ki kisi bhi toornament main chaahe vah vishwa cap cricket ho, asiad or olympic, vah pakistan ke saath koi match nahin khelegaa
 However, this step does not seem practical, as India may also suffer a lot of damage
 antarrashtriya aayojanon main kisi team ke khilaaf khilne se aap inkaar nahin kar sakate, agar koi desh aisa karata he to use iskaa kaaphi nuksaan uthaanaa padegaa
 10- Strict action on the border India can take many strict steps to strengthen its border
 samoochee seemaa par badebandi or anya upayon se ghuspaith ke liye jiro tolerance kii niti apanaai ja sakati he
 Apart from this, India can scare Pakistan by increasing the deployment of troops, arms and other military equipment along the border, to initiate action against the terrorists or else it will have to suffer the consequences

 birmingham main khele gaye isisi cricket world cap ke mukaable main england ne team india ko 31 ranon se haraa diya
 This is India's first defeat in this tournament
 toss jitkar pehle ballebaaji karne utari england kii team ne tabadatod batting karte hue 50 over main 7 wicket ke nuksaan par 337 ran banaae
 England scored 92 runs in the last 10 overs and set a huge target of 338 runs in front of India
 england ke liye johny beresto ne 111 ran, jesan roy ne 66 ran or ben stokes ne 79 ranon kii dhamaakedaar pari kheli
 In front of this mountain-like goal of England, Team India could score 306 runs for 5 wickets in 50 overs
 is jeet se england ko sanjivani mili he or semifinal ke liye uski ummiden ab bhi barkaraar hai
 There were four major reasons in this match that India lost the match: 1
 kuldeep or chahal kaa flop hona-team india ke sabase bade turup ke ikke kuldeep yadav or yujavendra chahal kaa is match main flop hona bahut mahangaa padaa
 Yuzvendra Chahal conceded 88 runs in 10 overs without any success in this match
 vahiin kuldeep yadav ne 10 over main 72 ran lutaae
 Due to such poor bowling of India, England openers lured runs
 chahal ne apane 10 overon ke cote main 7 chauke or 6 chakke khaae the
 Chahal has taken 10 wickets in 6 matches in the World Cup 2019
 ranon ke lihaaj se yah yujavendra ke vanade kariyar kaa sabase kharaab pradarshan rahaa
 Earlier, he had given a total of 80 runs in odis against Australia in March this year in Mohali
 england ne aakhri 10 overon main 92 ran batore or bharat ke saamne 338 ranon kaa vishaal lakshya rakhaa
 2
 dhoni kaa DRS ke liye manaa karnaa-is match main team india kaa jesan roy ke out hone par DRS nahin lenaa sabase bada terning point sabit hua
 Captain Virat Kohli bowled Hardik Pandya in the 11th over of England's innings to break the pair of Jason Roy and Johnny Bairstow, which became a headache for India
 hardik pandya ke 11wein over kii paanchavin gend jesan roy ke gloves ko chuumati hui dhoni ke paas chali gai
 After which Pandya and Dhoni appealed for a catch behind the wicket, but the umpire gave it wide
 iske baad kohli ne dhoni se baat kii
 Kohli did not take DRS on Dhoni's advice
 kohli ne us samay dhoni kii suni or diares kaa istemaal nahin kiya or baad main riple se saaf hua ki gend jesan roy ke gloves ko chuumati hui gai he
 Jason Roy was batting at a personal score of 21 at the time
 iske baad agali do gendon par roy ne chakke or chauke barasaaye
 If Kohli had taken the review, Roy would have had to return to the pavilion
 is faisle ke baad england ke opening ballebaajon ne or bhi tufaani bantig kii
 Jason Roy and Johnny Bairstow together 22
 1 over main hi 160 ranon kii opening partnership kar di
 If Jason Roy were out cheaply, England would not have reached such a big target
 3
 Getting Rahul to open despite injury - Rohit Sharma and KL Rahul's opening pair landed on the field in response to England's target of 338 runs
 england kii pari main fielding ke dauraan keel rahul chotil ho gaye the
 In the 16th over of England's innings, Rahul fell backward in an attempt to stop the six on the boundary
 jiske baad unhen maidan se baahar janaa padaa
 Team India's decision to get the injured Rahul to open was proved wrong and he returned to the pavilion after facing 9 balls to score zero
 bharat ne apana pehla wicket 8 ran ke score par hi ganvaa diya tha
 4
 bhartiya pari kaa ekmaatr chakka aakhri over main-viraat kohli or rohit sharma ke alaava middle order main kisi bhi ballebaaj kii batting aisi nahin dikhi ki vah is lakshya ko hasil kar paae
 Rishabh Pant, Hardik Pandya, Kedar Jadhav and MS Dhoni all appeared to be playing in front of the English bowlers
 pant (32) or pandya (45) ne kuch achche shot khele, lekin dhoni or jadhav kii partnership itani dhimi rahi ki bhartiya team yah match haar gai
 During the entire Indian innings, the only six hit in the last over
 vahiin england kii pari main 13 chakke lage the
 This was the biggest difference between the two teams

 The two divorced in 1964
 pati kamaal amrohi se alag hone ke baad minaa kii nazdikiyaan dharmendra se badhane lagi
 Dharmendra was a married straggling actor and Meena Top's actress
 kaha jaataa he ki dharmendra ko industry main khadaa karne kaa shrey minaa ko hi jaataa he
 Meena taught him the nuances of acting
 jaankaree ke anusaar minaa kumari ne 1966 main ai film 'phool or pathar' main dharmendra ko lene kii sifarish kii thi
 The film proved to be the biggest hit of that year and Dharmendra became completely stable in the industry

 But after three years, both of them parted their way

 Eunuch means eunuch yah kinnar jivan na to stri main he na purush main, lekin iskaa jivan to he, vah vyakti to he
 Narrator Mahendra Bhishma's novel Kinnar Katha reveals the life of eunuchs with great truth
 yah kisi saamaanya hijde kii nahin varan rajgaraane main paidaa hui sona urf chanda kii katha he
 It is the most surprising event for the royal family
 rajgaraane main kinnar kaa janm! yah baat kisi ke gale nahin utarati
 Sona escapes death and reaches the eunuch society
 ab vah chanda ban gai he, puri tarah kinnar
 The only favorite of that society! 
 
 
 tara kinnar samaaj kii guru he , usne chanda ko sanvaara, dulaara he
 Tara's character is emotional
 vah mata-pita ko yaad karke ankhen geeli karti rahati he
 There is depression in the characters as well as philosophy and religion
 nishchit hi kathakaar kaa ishwar main vishwaas he or vah ishwariya satta ko sweekaar karata he
 Mahendra Bhishma looks closely at culture, tradition and weather amidst the hindering intellectual progress
 unki smriti main barsaat he to tulsi kaa chaura bhi
 There is fluency in the narrative and this speed emphasizes readability
 chanda kaa charitra aakarshith karata he
 The manner of Bhishma's saying is interesting, where the sight goes from bread to prestige
 yahaan ek nakli hijdaa samaaj bhi he or uskaa guru bhi
 a fake society needs bread, which is taking away the right to the real
 yahaan asli kinnaron kii pratishtha kaa bhi prashn he
 Four branches of eunuchs are mentioned in the story: Buchra, Neelima, Mansa and Hansa
 bucharaa paidaaishi he, nilimaa swayan bane hai, mansa swechha se or hansaa shaareerik rup ke kaaran
 The eunuch society is a society without acceptance, where there is truth and there is also compassion, hunger and contempt
 aakhir ham us samaaj ke prati samvedanheen kyon hai? prashn yah bhi he
 The narrator himself is sentimental - more emotional, and engrossed in Chanda's story, he forgets 'I am eunuch so what is my fault in this?' Like sentences are coming many times
 yaheen kahin prem charchaa bhi he
 Chanda and Manish's love! There is newness here
 chanda na purush, na stri or manish purna purush
 Love again What is love here? Bhishma writes, 'some such love was started with Manish, who had reached very high levels of body, which can be called spiritual love, can also say mental love
 
 
 ’katha main nakli kinnaron kaa sangharsh he to pichhali charchit ghatnaon kaa zikr bhi
 There is a sense of scriptural responsibility among the characters in the narrative, but it should be more mature, to give a more distant view
 phir bhi mahendra bhishma majbootee se khadey hai
 they try
 
 
 or nirantar chalate rahane kii prakriya se badhkar bhala koun-sa sukh ho saktaa he
 In fiction, 'kinnar Katha' is present with an interesting subject
 katha kaa ant bataanaa thik nahin
 It is the desire of the narrator to get the reader to the ultimate readable pleasure of the story
 ham to or behatar kii ummid ke saath kathakaar ko dekh rahe hai
 Emraan Hashmi's name has also been added to the list of actors who have become producers
 shahrukh khan, salmaan khan, akshay kumaar, aamir khan pehle se hi is list main shaamil hai
 Emraan's first home production film is titled 'captain Nawab', whose first look has been revealed
 film main imran pehali barmaujee kii bhoomikaamein najar aaenge
 However, before this, he has been seen in the role of police in films like 'finger' and 'poison'
 poster main imran bharat or pakistan donon ke uniform main najar aa rahe hai
 Does this mean that the film is inspired by 'bajrangi Bhaijaan', in which Salman crosses the border
 imran ne twitor par apni is film kaa poster share kiya he
 And here it is, my first home production movie !!

 i know that you guys will make various guesses but for the time being i want to maintain this suspense
 ' is film ko 'ajahar' ke diarector tony disuja diarect karenge
 Imran pointed to the story of the film and said that it is based on true events
 philhal imran milan lutheriya kii film 'baadshaaho' kii shooting main vyast hai
 During the wethewomen event held in Mumbai, many stalwarts of Bollywood industry and politics met the audience
 is dauraan filmmekar karan johar, ekta kapur or kendriya mantri smriti irani ne darshakon ke kai sawaalon ke jawaab die
 In the conversation, Bollywood films that are being a part of the current politics of the country were also questioned
 smriti irani ne ise puri tarah se khaarij kiya
 Smriti Irani's U-turn on Padmavati, now this statement, actually, some audience asked Smriti Irani, why films are targeted? Artistic films are suppressed under politics? Will there be artistic freedom? jawaab main smriti ne kaha, 'chunaav ke dauraan hi kyon ye prashn uthta he
 Have we not become the PR of a film? main prasoon joshi ke kaam se khush hum
 He is doing a very good job
 ek naagarik ke taur par hamen chahie ki ham kanoon ke daayre main hi kaam karen
 "so, did the makers do a PR stunt on Padmavati? Smriting government interference in films, Smriti said," If that was the case, why would you pass Kejriwal's film
 arvind kejariwal par film relies hui
 It was released in the same government
 ye pichhali sarkaar main nahin ho pai thi
 It does not have political benefits, so there is no discussion
 ' smriti boleen, 'hamaari sarkaar ne kuch galat nahin kiya
 If i speak publicly on the matter, neither me nor the censor board, but anyone who has done this PR stunt, will be hurt
 ' smriti ne kaha, karan, ekta yaa main industry se hai
 Now i am in the ministry
 ham jaanate filmon ke piaar ke liye kis kis tarah ke hatkande apanaae jate rahe hen
 Padmavati: Tharoor told the Maharajas that cowardly Smriti asked scindia-diggi to answer
 During this program Smriti gave the intention and reason of the government for not releasing the films
 iske alaava bhi unhone kai mjedaar baaten share kii
 Smriti shared a funny incident related to her life during the Kissasis program of 'tulsi' going to jail
 smriti ne bataaya ki jab vah ek baar mulund main teen-chaar ghante ke liye dharna de rahi thim
 Then he was arrested by the police and taken to the police station
 smriti ne bataaya ki jab vah arest huin to vahaan police waalon kii patniyaan pahunch gayi or boleen, tulsi ko jail main kyon daalaa?bataa den ki smriti irani tivi ke sabase mashhoor serial kyonki saas bhi kabhi bahu thi ke kirdaar tulsi se behad femes huin thim
 Reaction of Smriti Irani as Minister, Ekta Kapoor- OH MY GOD Ekta Kapoor revealed the first reaction when Smriti Irani became a minister
 ekta kapur ne bataaya ki jaise hi unhen is baat kaa pataa chalaa to unhone kaha- 'oh moy god
 Sharing this anecdote, we came to know that as soon as Ekta called and said - So from today we will stop talking about film and television
 or smriti ne kaha-haa
 After this Ekta said that Smriti is like a friend for her today
 or 
 As it is said that women degrade women, they are not right
 ham ek duusare ko aage badhaate hai or ek duusare ke liye hamaare dil main bahut sammaan he
 Smriti boli-nihalani is a senior, no matter what movies she has made, when Smriti Irani was asked by Karan Johar, 'who are you influential in mainstream media?', Smriti said in response, 'I don't know you heard about them Whether or not she is not a part of main stream media, nor does she always agree with us but she makes great comments on the economy, she is Rupa Ubrmnya
 rashtriya maanavadhikaar ayog kii ek jaanch team ne paaya he ki uttar pradesh main kairana se kai pariwaron ne ‘aparaadh main badhotaree’ or vahaan kanoon evam vyavastha kii ‘girti’ sthiti ke dar se ‘palaayan’ kiya
 On the basis of its facts, the Commission has sent a notice to the Chief Secretary of the State and the Director General of Police asking them to submit an action report on the team's comments and recommendations within eight weeks
 team ne sambandhit saakshyon, pratyakshdarshiyon, swatantra gavaahon, sambandhit police adhikariyon or esadm se bhi baatcheet kii
 The comments enechaarsi ne ek bayaan main kaha, team ne kairana ke saansad ke pies se 346 visthapit pariwaron yaa vyaktiyon kii ek suchi bhi hasil kii
 Three residential sites were selected on that list and six alleged victims or displaced families or individuals were selected for verification
 (hedline ke alaava, is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he, yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he

 ) (except for the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it is published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) The three divorces may have been hanging in the Rajya Sabha but the Muslim Personal Law Board is unable to get out of confusion
 hyderabad main hui board kii 26veen baithak board ke varisht sadsy moulana salmaan nadvi ke ayodhya masale par vivaadit bayaan kii bhent chadhakar khatm ho gai or is masale par jami barf pigal nahin saki
 The board is also claiming that the bill interferes with the Shari'a, and also to remove some gaps and accept it
 aise main sarkaar or board ke bich bhi sahmati kaa koi rasta nahin khul paaya he
 Prior to the Supreme Court's decision, the model Nikahnama, which the noise board had created, was not even discussed in the meeting
 board jo kahata he, sarkaar kaa rukh dekhakar use kar nahin paata he
 Everyone believes that three divorces together is bad, but when the government seizes the opportunity to remove it, the board has no other way than to oppose the bill
 baithak se ek din purv board pravaktaa moulana khalil-ur-rahamaan sajaad nomani ne hyderabad main kaha tha, ''teen talaak vidheyak ek bada dhokhaa he
 We do not oppose it, but seek a change in the deficiencies that are against the fundamental rights of Muslim women and men
 isse talaak kii puri vyavastha khatm kii ja rahi he
 "the question arises that if the bill is the problem then what is the solution? In the Supreme Court hearing on triple talaq, the board had said that it is going to run a reform campaign in Muslims and implement the model Nikahnama
" lekin do saal baad bhi yah nahin ho sakaa
 Actually, the board does not want to disturb the talk of Model Nikahnama till the change in the Bill
 isamen nikaah ke samay anubandh hoga ki ek baar main teen talaak nahin denge
 If this happens, this contract will become a strong evidence in court for the wife which will prove to be a double hit on the husband with the provisions of the Bill
 ol india muslim majalis-e-mushaavrat kii varisht upaadhyaksh uzma naahid kahati hai, ''sharai daayre main iskaa hal nikaalane main der hui he
 Islam has a gender justice and the proposed bill is the opposite
 talaak par sau fisadi mard hi galat nahin ho saktaa
 "uzma, who has been a member of the board, expresses regret in the same thing
" We had given the model to the board a decade ago and 350 ulema tested it at the behest of the board
 lekin yah lagu nahin ho sakaa
 Otherwise, it does not come today
 ’’pramukh devbandi ulema or ol india tanzim ulema-e-hind ke pradeshdhyaksh moulana nadimul vaajadi isi baat ko aage badhaate hai, ''board model nikaahnamaa sabhi ulema ke saamne pesh kar chukaa he
 It could not be implemented because of the mistake
 ab bhi bahut der nahin hui he or is par mohar laga deni chahie
 "but now the government has made it a question of prestige and the Prime Minister himself has expressed his intention to get the bill passed in the Rajya Sabha
 mana jaataa he ki hyderabad baithak se pehle board ko piem se mulaakaat kaa samay isiilie nahin diya gaya
 Dean of theology department at Aligarh Muslim University, Dr
 mufti jaahid ali khan ise yun maanate hai, ‘‘board ne apni jimmedaari adaa nahin kii
 Three divorces at one time were unfair, which is also forbidden in Sharia
 iskaa hal nikaalane kii koshish kii ja sakati thi
 "but how to overcome the confrontation between the board and the government?" On this, he says with utmost sincerity, "the question is not whether the board delayed the government talk or the government did not give a chance
" masalaa yah he ki piem khud ko muslim mahilaon kaa hitaishi or board unhen muslim virdohi pesh kar rahaa he
 Both seem out of their dignity
 ’’haalanki supreme court ke faisle ke baad centre sarkaar teen talaak par alag se kanoon banane kii baat se inkaar kar chuki thi, tab board ne kaha tha ki kanoon bana to supreme court main chunauti denge lekin ab khaamiyon ko dur karke ise sweekaar karne kii baat ho rahi he
 Are there really flaws in this? Professor Hasina Hashia of the Department of Gender Geography at Jamia Millia Islamia, Delhi answers, "this bill has been passed in the Lok Sabha in a hurry
" ise lekar board or muslim mahila sanghathanon se charchaa kii jaani chahie thi
 The government has put a civil case in the criminal category
 ’’ professor hashia board kii sadsy bhi hai or 1990 se ek saath teen talaak ke khilaaf board main aawaaj uthaati rahi hai
 The Islamic world follows Imam Abu Hanifa (hanafi) Imam Hambal (hambali) Imam Shafai and Imam Malik (maliki) the four Imams, while Shia Muslims follow Imam Jafar (guru of Abu Hanifa)
 duniya main abu hanipha ke anuyaayi sarvaadhik hai or bharat main devbandi or barelvi vichaardhaara main bante hai
 ahl-e-hadith, inspired by Imam Shafai, is Salafi and Wahabi who do not already consider three divorces together
 lekin desh main mutthi bhar sankhya ke kaaran baakiyon kii tarah samuhik dharmik maamalon main ye bhi personal lau board kaa samarthan karte hai
 Maulana Asghar Salafi, the head of ahl-e-hadith in India, says, "we follow the Quran and the Hadith
 har daur main ham ek majalis main teen talaak ko ek hi maanate hai
 Hanafi Muslims believe it is wrong
 board ko sudhaar kii jarurat he or is masale par bahut der kar di gai he
 Nevertheless we are with the board and it should implement the model Nikahnama soon
 ’’ lekin board jis model nikaahnamaa kii baat kar rahaa he vah jaagruk muslimon main teen talaak kii buraai ke khilaaf sadiyon se maujuud he
 Maureana Syed Athar Hussain Dehalvi, president of Barelvi Ulema and Anjuman minhaj-e-rasool, shows three contracts made on 11 rupees stamp paper that his maternal grandfather, mother and wife made during the marriage of his maternal grandfather, father and father
 inamen pati-patni ke bich qaraar hai ki bina jaij kaaran gusse yaa apavitra haalat main talaak nahin denge
 Maulana Dehalvi does not accept the role of the board as correct
 ve kehete hai, ''jis din board ke mahasachiv moulana vali rahamaani ne is masale par piem par nishaanaa saadhaa tha, usee din is par raajnneeti haaavee ho gai thi
 PM belongs to any party but his post is constitutional
 sarkaar se baat karnaa hamaara sanvaidhanik adhikaar or jawaab dena sarkaar kaa sanvaidhanik kartavya he
 The government should understand the difference between murder and divorce
 board jis tarah sarkaar se baat karne se bachataa rahaa, usee tarah model nikaahnamaa pesh karne se bhaag rahaa he
 The law on the issue of triple talaq, which came to be enacted, may be declared invalid but it remains in the Deobandi ideology
 devbandi ise ‘buraai’ or ‘bidat’ to maanate hai lekin yah tark bhi dete hai ki agar kisi ne ek baar main teen baar talaak kah diya to talaak ho gaya
 The question is the same: Why is there scope to maintain the existence of such a thing or ritual in religion? Which was declared evil and which is not proved even from the Quran and Hadith
 baharhaal, board ne hal nikaala nahin, sarkaar jo kar rahi he vah bhi hal nahin, phir hal he kya? or yah sawaal kab tak khadaa rahegaa? baharhaal board ko kahin na kahin yah dar bhi sata rahaa he ki aaj agar yah ladaai haar gaye to kal muslim personal lau ko hi na haar jaaen
 The possibilities of uniform civil law are enormous on the board's present and the board has deviated from its present in order to exist under the guise of protecting an 'evil'
