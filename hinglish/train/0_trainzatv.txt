 According to the Supreme Court, the involvement of the executive in the appointment of judges, the encroachment of the powers of the judiciary which is contrary to the principle of separation of powers
 chunki samvidhan ke teenon angon (karypalika, nyaaypalika or vidhayika) ke bich shakti pruthakkaran kaa yah siddhant samvidhan kaa mul lakshan he or yah ayog iskaa ulanghan karata he to yah asanvaidhanik ghoshit kar diya gaya
 Now if we go back to the First Judges Case again, we see that the Executive had a role in the appointment of judges in the original Constitution
 UPA sarkaar ke JAC vidheyak par banane vaali standing cameti ne bhi yahi paaya tha ki jajon kii niyukti praathmik rup se karypalika kaa kaary he
 The executive does this through the president, in which the judiciary is consulted
 aisa nyaaypalika kii swatantraaa ke lihaaz se kiya jaataa he, jo samvidhan kii mul aatma main shaamil he
 In this way, till the interpretation of the first case and (made in the year 2013) of this Standing Committee, we find something else of the basic features of the Constitution
 jabaki 2nd Case se kahani palatney lagati he or ise palatney vaala koi or nahin balki swayan nyaaypalika bhi he
 If seen, the judiciary has also violated the principle of Rule of Natural Justice in the same case, because it is a party to itself and listens to promises about its own powers and gives decisions in its favor
 aaj kii raajnneeti ko dekhakar hamen karypalika kii bhagidaari par andeh ho saktaa he lekin asanvaidhanik tehraae gaye ayog kii sanrachana ko agar ham baariki se dekhen to paaenge ki yah chizon ko sudhaarney main nishchit madad karata
 If we take the example of major countries of the world, be it the United States, Canada or Europe, United Kingdom, Germany or France, the executive also has a role in the appointment of judges in these countries
 in deshon main jaj hi jajon kii niyukti nahin karte
 But we remain unique in this matter
 ab chunki koi bhi kaanoon nyaaypalika ke punarreekshan se nahin batch saktaa to NJAC jaisaa koi ayog kabhi ban bhi paaegaa, yah dur kii kaudi lagati he
 Therefore, we will have to work only by appointments on tea sips
 ab isamen pariwadwad aae yaa jatvaad, aapako iskaa paksh lenaa hi hoga kyonki aap to vaicharik virodh se upar uthakar chizon ko dekhnaa hi nahin chaahate
 Today Delhi's sleep is open due to rain
 badalon ne mausam to suhana kar diya lekin saath logon ke dil main dar bhi baitha, kya aaj phir sadak par mushkilon se do-chaar hona padegaa
 Right now it is raining intermittently, but there is a danger of jam on the road
 badalon ne subah se hi tevar dikhaane shuru kar die
 Till a few days ago, the drop in the thirsty drop in Delhi, the clouds are intent on breaking the record
 jo badal shuru main dil ko sukun pahunchaate the ab vahiin badal sadak par nikalne main khauf paidaa kar rahe hai
 It was only a few hours ago, on Wednesday, Delhi was so drenched by the rain that the entire capital was devastated
 sadakon par fansi mahangi gadiyon ko kraine ke sahare kii jarurat aa padi thi
 There is a fear that the situation may not be the same as on Thursday
 isliye agar aap isse bachanaa chaahate hai barish ke tandav se to salaah yahi he ki ghar se daftar ke liye aam dinon ke mukaable thodaa pehle nikalen
 Surprisingly, in a few hours of rain, this condition of the capital Delhi would happen
 har saal kaa yahi ronaa he lekin phir bhi isse nipatane ke koi itanjam nahin kiye jate
 However, Delhi got a big relief from Yamuna
 buudhvaar shaam tak yamuna kaa jo pani khatre ke nishaan ko chune par amada tha raat bhar main uskaa jalastr neeche aa gaya
 The water level may have decreased but the threat still remains in the low-lying areas of Delhi
 or agar aisi hi barish hoti rahi to yamuna ko bhi simaaen langhane main zyada vakt nahin lagegaa

 He said that his health is poor and the arrest can cause many serious problems for him
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki yadi police chaahe to aakar unhen giraftaar kar sakati he
 Madani, who appeared for the first time in front of the media after the prohibitory orders around her camp, swore by the belief that she had no role in the Bangalore blast case but was falsely implicated by the Karnataka police
 unhone kaha ki maine tii nazeer (hiraasat main band maamle kaa pramukh aaropee) sahit kisi se bhi sidhe yaa phone par baatcheet nahin kii
 The PDP leader said that he has been accused that he went to Coorg in Karnataka as part of the conspiracy to explode

 jab use agra jail main bheja gaya tha, tab usne vahaan 14 maheene kii bhukh hadtaal kii thi or jail prashasan ke haath-paanv phool gaye the
 The extent to which Bitta karate is dangerous can be gauged from the fact that he was also accused of beheading and killing a prisoner while in prison in Kashmir Valley
 kashmir ghati main bitta kii jindagi kaa vah pehla katl tha, or jiskaa katl usne kiya tha vah uskaa jigari dost (kashmiri pandit yuvak ram) tha

 Running on the treadmill is the best way to do cardio exercise
 baaki mashiinon kii tulana main trade mil ke jariye vajan ghataana utana mushkil bhi nahin he
 But it is also very important to take some precautions during this
 1
 Not running on a barefoot treadmill creates a lot of heat due to frictions and fast movements
 isliye agar aap bina juute trade mil par daudenge to aapke paanv main jalan ho sakati he
 If the foot is accidentally slipped on the sides of the belt, serious injury can also occur
 iske alaava fungus or kitanu kaa bhi khatra hota he
 Therefore, one should run on the treadmill only by wearing fitting shoes
 2
 Before starting the machine, do not place the belt on the deck, so whenever you start the tread mill, its initial speed is low
 yani is baat se koi fark nahin padataa ki aakhri baar ise band karne ke dauraan isaki speed kya thi
 This feature is given in the machine so that your balance does not get disturbed due to the sudden rotation of the belt at high speed
 phir bhi agar mashin main koi gadabadi ho jaae, or shuruaati speed aapaki kshamta se zyada ho to?isliye hameshaa yah salaah di jaati he ki jab bhi aap mashin on karen, usase pehle apane donon paanv kinaaron par yani deck par failaa len
 Then, after setting the belt speed according to yourself, keep your foot on it
 3
 Never look down while running on the treadmill
 It is often the case that people start to see the movement of their feet on a treadmill running tired or in excitement
 lekin aisa karnaa khatarnaak he kyonki is dauraan aap balance kho sakate hai or kisi accident kaa shikaar ho sakate hai
 So always look at the front while running
 aise main aapako saans lene or chhodane main bhi pareshaani nahin hogi
 4
 daudte vakt handrel naa pakadereksar aisa hota he ki treadmill par daudte daudte log handrel pakad lete hai
 But if you do this for a long time, then the arm will be stiff and the pain will start
 dhyaan rahe, agar aapkoexrasij ke bichamen handrel kaa sahaara lene kii naubat aa jaae to iskaa matlab he ki aapaki treadmill kii speed jarurat se zyada he
 5
 dhire-dhire badhayen speedtrade mil kii speed eka ek naa badhayen
 By increasing its speed slowly, your body will also get time for warm-up and there will be no stiffness in your muscles
 6
 Do not keep excessively, know your 'target heart rate' before running on the speedtreadmill of the trade mill
 jaldivajan ghataane ke chakkar menzyada speed naa rakhen
 No one should run at more than 50-70% speed of their 'target heart rate'
 agar aisa nahin kiya ko aapako dil kaa daura bhi pad saktaa he
 7
 chalati trade mil se kabhi naa utrenbhale hi koi jaruri kol aa jaae yaa daravaaje par koi lagaataar nock kar rahaa ho, bhuulakar bhi chalati treadmill se utarane kii koshish naa karen
 If necessary, press the emergency button, only when the belt stops completely, take off from it
 kyonki chalati treadmill se utarane par aapako chakkar aa saktaa he yaa phir aap balance khokar gir bhi sakate hai

 In the midst of the growing crisis between Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) and MTNL, the Prime Minister's Office has agreed in principle to intervene
 beasenel karmchaaree sangh ne viares lagu karne ke prastaav kaa virodh kiya he, isliye yah sankat aasaani se sulajhata nahin dikh rahaa
 According to the news agency PTI, the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) has asked the Department of Telecommunications to present a detailed framework for the revival of BSNL and MTNL including allocation of 4G spectrum, reduction in BSNL workforce through VRS, etc
 
 sangh kaa aarope-nijee company ko bechney kii taiyarisarkari doorsanchaar company beasenel ke karmchaaree sangh ne guuruuvaar ko sarkaar ke svaichhik sevanivritti yojana (viares) lagu karne ke prastaav kaa virodh kiya
 The union alleged that this was a strategy to reduce BSNL employees before handing them over to the private company
 beasenel karmchaaree sangh ne bayaan main sarkaar par company ke saath sautela rukh apnaane kaa aarope lagaaya kyonki usne beasenel ko kaarobaar main vruddhi ke liye jaruri 4ji spectrum kaa aavanton nahin kiya
 CMD denied the layoffs, however BSNL CMD Anupam Shrivastava has denied that there is going to be any layoffs in the company
 unhone twit kar kaha ki karmchaariyon ko viares kii peshkash to kii ja rahi he, lekin chantni ke bare main media main ai khabaren sahi nahin hai
 Turnaround of # bsnlbeing devised by @ dot_india & @ bsnlcorporateincludes allotment of 4G spectrum & offering lucrative VRS to willing staff
 Reduction of retirement age or laying off employees is not at all being considered
 BSNL denies any such media appearances in this regard
 — Anupam Shrivastava (@cmdbsnl)april 3, 2019kyon nahin kiya 4ji kaa aavantankarmchaaree sangh ne kaha ki doorsanchaar mantri manoj sinha ne janvari 2018 main bharosa dilaayaa tha ki beasenel ko 4ji sevaaon ke liye spectrum kaa aavanton kiya jayega lekin yah maamla abhi tak lambit padaa he
 According to sources, the Department of Telecommunications had issued a cabinet note to BSNL for allocation of spectrum for 4G services, but the Finance Ministry has questioned the commercial viability of such a proposal
 sangh ne kaha, 'dhyaan diya janaa chahie ki emtnael main viares do baar pehle lagu kiya ja chukaa he
 However, it did not help in improving the financial position of MTNL
 isliye ham is ore dhyaan dilaanaa chaahate hai ki viares beasenel ke vittiya punaruddhar main madadgaar nahin he
 He said that the government should immediately allocate 4G spectrum to BSNL for financial revival and financially help BSNL by giving concessional loans for expansion and modernization of the network
 gauratlab he ki guuruuvaar ko yah khabar ai thi ki emtnael or beasenel karmchaariyon ko svaichhik sevanivritti yojana (viares) kii peshkash karne ko lekar mantrimandal note jari karne ke liye doorsanchaar mantralay chunaav ayog se manjuuri maangega
 However, the final decision in this regard can be taken only after the election
 iske alaava karmchaariyon ke ritairement kii umr main bhi 2 saal kii katautee kii jaaegi
 It was estimated that 54,000 employees in BSNL will be laid off by this scheme
 bharat sanchaar nigam limited (BSNL) ke karmchaariyon kii sankhya 1
 76 lakhs, while MTNL has 22,000 employees
 aisa anumaan he ki agle paanch se chah saal main emtnael ke 16,000 karmchaaree tathaa beasenel ke 50 fisadi karmchaaree ritair ho jaaenge
 VRS for BSNL and MTNL can save Rs 6,365 crore and Rs 2,120 crore respectively
 vibhaag viares ke vitt poshan ke liye 10 saal kaa bond jari karegaa
 In the case of MTNL, the pay ratio has reached 90 per cent while in case of BSNL it is around 60 to 70 per cent

 'let us tell you that on Wednesday, a dead body was taken out against sealing in the textile market of Amar Colony

 https: / / t
 co / yfgzel2huq — Amitabh Bachchan (@srbachchan) December 31, 2014 Watch the song 'pidli' from the film 'shamitabh': antarrashtriya mahila diwas ke maukey par pradhanmantri narendra modi ne mahilaon ke khilaaf hinsa kii ninda karte hue aaj kaha ki 'hamaara sir shame se jhuk jaataa he' or elaan kiya ki sankat kii sthiti main mahilaon kii sahaayta karne ke liye 'van stop centre' or 'mobile helplinon' kii sthapana kii jaaegi
 In a message on International Women's Day, the Prime Minister said, 'I salute the indomitable courage and outstanding achievements of women
 aaj, ham mahilaon ko hamaare vikaas kii yatra kaa samaan evam abhinn hissaa banane kaa sankalp phir se doharaate hai
 'he said,' When we hear about the incidents of crime against women, our heads bow down in shame
 hamen mahilaon ke khilaaf har tarah ke bhedbhaav or anyaay ko khatm karne ke liye kandhe se kandhaa mila kar chalanaa hoga
 ' pradhanmantri ne kaha, 'meri sarkaar ne mahilaon ke jivan main sakaaratmak badlaav laane ke liye kai kadam uthaae hai
 It is at the heart of our vision of India's progress and a dignified life and opportunity for all our citizens
 ' unhone is pariklpana ko hakeekat main badalane ke liye har tarah ke sahyog kaa aahvaan karte hue kaha, 'sarkaar van stop centaron kii sthapana kar rahi he jo hinsa yaa durvyavhaar kaa saamana karne vaali mahilaon ko sahaayta, kanoonee salaah tathaa manovaigyanik counsailing muhaiyaa karaayenge
 ' pradhanmantri modi ne kaha, 'sarkaar ek mobile helpline bhi shuru kar rahi he taaki mahilaayein counselling tathaa paraamarsh sambandhi sevaaon tak pahunch ke liye 181 number dial kar unhen hasil kar saken
 ' modi ne 'antarrashtriya mahila diwas par mahilaon ke adamya saahas or ullekhneey uplabdhiyon' ko salaam karte hue kaha 'vibhinn yojanaon or pahalon ke madhyam se hamaari sarkaar mahilaon ke jivan main sakaaratmak badlaav laane ke liye puri tarah patibaddh he
 ' unhone kaha ki kendriya bajet main vyapak saamaajik suraksha yojanaon jaise pradhanmantri suraksha beemaa yojana, pradhanmantri jivan beemaa yojana or atal pension yojana aadi kaa zikr he jinka mahilaon ko bada laabh hoga
 Modi said that the 'beti Bachao, Beti Padhao' scheme is an attempt to bring about a change in attitude towards girls, with an emphasis on their education
 isi tarah sukanya samruddhi yojana yuvatiyon kii shiksha or vivaah main sahyog muhaiyaa karaayegi
 The body of the girl has been recovered from a pond in a village in Raipur, the capital of Chhattisgarh
 ladki kii hatya kisi tejadhaar hathiyaar se kii gai he
 Police have taken the body and sent it for postmortem
 police maamle kii chaanbin kar rahi he
 The case is related to the temple Hassaud area near Raipur, where 23-year-old America Patel and his entire family work in agriculture
 vaardaat ke din bhi yuvati khet se subjiyan laai thi
 Giving her mother vegetables, she sent them to the market
 phir vah ghar laut ai
 In the evening she went to the pond about 500 meters away from the house to wash clothes
 der shaam tak jab wo waapas nahin ai to gharavaalon ne aas-paas paas pados main uske bare main poochtacha kii
 He was then searched in the village
 tabhi shaam ke kareeb saadhe saat baje gaanvvaalon kotalab main amarika patel kii lashmili
 The police were informed immediately
 police ne maukey par jaakar shav ko talab se baahar niklaa or postmortem ke liye bheja
 Police discovered the body and found that the woman had bruises on her throat and head
 jo kisi tejadhaar hathiyaar se hamale kii taraf ishaara kar rahe the
 On this basis, the police have registered a case of murder and started investigating the case
 bihar kii sattarudh mahagathbandhan ke do sheersh netaa, janata dal united (jediu) ke adhyaksh nitish kumaar or rashtriya janata dal (rajd) ke adhyaksh, lalu yadav bhale shant baithe hon lekin in dono netaaon ke qareebi netaa ab apane-apane netaaon ke liye aakraamak mudra main hai
 Even though Nitish and Lalu have advised their party spokespersons to make a sobering statement, everything is still not normal
 jahaan ek ore nitish kumaar kii ore se unke party ke rashtriya pravaktaa kasee tyaagi ne congress party ke varisht netaa ghulaam nabi azaad ke kilaaf bolte hue yahaan tak kah daalaa ki atal bihari vaajapeyi ke samay unki party kabhi ek sahyogi ke taur par asahaj nahin thi jiskaa sidhaa arth ye mana gaya ki vartmaan mahagathbandhan kii sarkaar main wo sahaj nahin mahasoos kar rahi
 Along with this, Sanjay Jha, a close confidant of Nitish and former Legislative Councilor, even went so far as to tell the statement of Ghulam Nabi Azad that during the Emergency, an engineering pass man was sent to Buxar and Bhagalpur Jail for 19 months to protect his principles and democratic values
 Had to be imprisoned abhi congress ke netaa ne nitish kumaar ke siddhant ko lekar bayaan diya he
 He is a member of the same youth brigade of Congress which was engaged in crushing all democratic values and principles during the Emergency
 main congress ke varisht netaa ko yaad dilaanaa chahta hum ki congress or aap jaise tatkaaleen yuva netaaon ke 'siddhant' kii vajah se hi nitish kumaar ko bhi desh ke lakhon logon ke saath 19 maheene tak jail main rahanaa padaa tha
 Talking about Congress Presidential candidate Meera Kumar, Jha reminded his father's context that today Congress leaders are suddenly reminded of the late Jagjivan Babu
 unhen ye nahin bhoolanaa chahie ki immergency ke dauraan inakam tex kaa dar dikhaakar unhen kis had tak pratadit kiya gaya tha
 This was the reason that Jagjivan Babu left the Congress after the Emergency
 is bayaan ke ek hi din pehle jha ne tejasvi yadav ke 'dil kii baat' par kaha tha ki unhen najar uthaakar yah dekhne kii aavashyaktaa he ki soshal media par lambii-chaudee baaten likhane or saamaajik nyaay kii baaten karne bhar se samaaj kaa utthan nahin hota he
 This requires work on the ground
 17 saal tak satta main rahane vaale or secularism kaa dhol peetane vaale netaa 'bhagalpur danga' peediton ko nyaay nahin dilaa sake the
 In a direct attack on lalu-rabri Raj, Sanjay Jha said that on the basis of the recommendation of the Commission, the case closed on the support of lobbying program was reopened
 in maamalon main kuch aparaadhiyon ko sajaa bhi mili to kuch ke khilaaf aaj bhi cese chal rahe hai
 Based on the recommendation of the Commission, on the lines of 1984 'sikh riot' victims, 'bhagalpur riot' victims were given compensation as well as monthly pension
 mere khyaal se bihar ke itihaas main yah sabase badi saamaajik nyaay kii ladaai thi
 It is not possible for those who beat the drum of secularism to go beyond the big streak that Nitish Kumar has pulled today
 lekin rashtriya janata dal ke netaa is par kahaan chup rahane vaale the
 On his side, Shivanand Tiwari, who once sat everywhere with Nitish and Lalu Yadav these days, gave a lot of advice to Nitish Kumar simultaneously
 shivanand ne apane bayaan main kaha ki nitish itane murkh nahin hai ki is gathbandhan se alag hokar punah bhaajapa ke saath rishta joden
 Tiwari said that the leaders of Nitish's party say that his 'authority' has been challenged by the RJD people
 kisi athurity?
 Authority to arbitrate is not found in the alliance
 gathbandhan ne aapako netaa banaaya he
 It is your responsibility to take everyone in confidence
 tippaniyan Shivanand sarcastically said that he is not hesitant to support Modi ji's candidate
 jabaki endie main rahete hue inako narendra modi se itnaa parhez tha ki bhoj kaa nyotaa dekar waapas le liya tha
 Today, the same presidential candidate of Modi has started to interest him
 haalanki abhi bhi mujhe lagata he ki nitish gathbandhan se alag nahin honge
 If this happens, Nitish may continue as the chief minister but will get rid of people's minds
 ek choti party ke netaa hone ke baavjood unki jo rashtriya chhavi bani hui he vah dhul main mil jaaegi
 It is well known that both Shivanand and Sanjay Jha would not dare to make a statement publicly without Lalu and Nitish's consent
 shivanand kaa betaa rashtriya janata dal se vidhayak bhi hai
 But according to political analysts, the line of trust between Lalu and Nitish has become very weak
 aise main bihar main mahagathbandhan sarkaar kaa bhavishya adhar main latak gaya he
 Along with this, Sanjay Jha, a close confidant of Nitish and former Legislative Councilor, even went so far as to tell the statement of Ghulam Nabi Azad that during the Emergency, an engineering pass man was sent to Buxar and Bhagalpur Jail for 19 months to protect his principles and democratic values

 main congress ke varisht netaa ko yaad dilaanaa chahta hum ki congress or aap jaise tatkaaleen yuva netaaon ke 'siddhant' kii vajah se hi nitish kumaar ko bhi desh ke lakhon logon ke saath 19 maheene tak jail main rahanaa padaa tha
 Talking about Congress Presidential candidate Meera Kumar, Jha reminded his father's context that today Congress leaders are suddenly reminded of the late Jagjivan Babu
 unhen ye nahin bhoolanaa chahie ki immergency ke dauraan inakam tex kaa dar dikhaakar unhen kis had tak pratadit kiya gaya tha
 This was the reason that Jagjivan Babu left the Congress after the Emergency
 is bayaan ke ek hi din pehle jha ne tejasvi yadav ke 'dil kii baat' par kaha tha ki unhen najar uthaakar yah dekhne kii aavashyaktaa he ki soshal media par lambii-chaudee baaten likhane or saamaajik nyaay kii baaten karne bhar se samaaj kaa utthan nahin hota he
 This requires work on the ground
 17 saal tak satta main rahane vaale or secularism kaa dhol peetane vaale netaa 'bhagalpur danga' peediton ko nyaay nahin dilaa sake the
 In a direct attack on lalu-rabri Raj, Sanjay Jha said that on the basis of the recommendation of the Commission, the case closed on the support of lobbying program was reopened
 in maamalon main kuch aparaadhiyon ko sajaa bhi mili to kuch ke khilaaf aaj bhi cese chal rahe hai
 Based on the recommendation of the Commission, on the lines of 1984 'sikh riot' victims, 'bhagalpur riot' victims were given compensation as well as monthly pension
 mere khyaal se bihar ke itihaas main yah sabase badi saamaajik nyaay kii ladaai thi
 It is not possible for those who beat the drum of secularism to go beyond the big streak that Nitish Kumar has pulled today
 lekin rashtriya janata dal ke netaa is par kahaan chup rahane vaale the
 On his side, Shivanand Tiwari, who once sat everywhere with Nitish and Lalu Yadav these days, gave a lot of advice to Nitish Kumar simultaneously
 shivanand ne apane bayaan main kaha ki nitish itane murkh nahin hai ki is gathbandhan se alag hokar punah bhaajapa ke saath rishta joden
 Tiwari said that the leaders of Nitish's party say that his 'authority' has been challenged by the RJD people
 kisi athurity?
 Authority to arbitrate is not found in the alliance
 gathbandhan ne aapako netaa banaaya he
 It is your responsibility to take everyone in confidence
 tippaniyan Shivanand sarcastically said that he is not hesitant to support Modi ji's candidate
 jabaki endie main rahete hue inako narendra modi se itnaa parhez tha ki bhoj kaa nyotaa dekar waapas le liya tha
 Today, the same presidential candidate of Modi has started to interest him
 haalanki abhi bhi mujhe lagata he ki nitish gathbandhan se alag nahin honge
 If this happens, Nitish may continue as the chief minister but will get rid of people's minds
 ek choti party ke netaa hone ke baavjood unki jo rashtriya chhavi bani hui he vah dhul main mil jaaegi
 It is well known that both Shivanand and Sanjay Jha would not dare to make a statement publicly without Lalu and Nitish's consent
 shivanand kaa betaa rashtriya janata dal se vidhayak bhi hai
 But according to political analysts, the line of trust between Lalu and Nitish has become very weak

 On the same day before this statement, Jha said on Tejashwi Yadav's 'dil Ki Baat' that he needs to look at it and see that writing social media on social media and talking about social justice does not uplift society it happens
 iske liye jameen par kaam karne kii jarurat hoti he
 The leaders who had been in power for 17 years and had beaten the drum of secularism could not provide justice to the victims of 'bhagalpur riot'
 sanjay jha ne lalu-rabadi raaj par sidhaa hamalaa bolte hue kaha ki ayog kii sifarish ke aadhaar par pairvi paigaam ke sahare band ho chuke cese ko phir se khulwaaya gaya
 In these cases, some criminals were also punished, while some cases are still going on against them
 ayog kii sifarish ke aadhaar par 1984 'sikh danga' peediton kii tarj par 'bhagalpur danga' peediton ko muaavje ke saath-saath masik pension bhi diya gaya
 i think this was the biggest social justice fight in the history of Bihar
 nitish kumaar ne jitani badi lakeer aaj khinch di he usase aage badhanaa secularism kaa dhol peetane waalon ke liye sambhav nahin he
 But where were the leaders of the Rashtriya Janata Dal going to keep quiet on this? unki taraf se kabhi nitish or in dinon lalu yadav ke saath har jagah baithne vaale shivanand tiwari ne nitish kumaar ko ek saath kai naseehat de daali
 Shivanand said in his statement that Nitish is not so foolish to break away from this alliance and re-establish a relationship with BJP
 tiwari ne kaha ki nitish kii party ke netaa kehete hai ki unki 'athurity' ko argedy waalon ne chunauti di he
 What kind of authority? gathbandhan main manamaana karne kii athurity nahin milti he
 The alliance has made you a leader

 While in the NDA, he was so fed up with Narendra Modi that he had withdrawn by inviting the banquet
 aaj unheen modi kaa raashtrapati ummidavaar inako ruchane laga he
 However, i still think Nitish will not break away from the alliance

 Commerce Secretary SR Rao said that we have also seen the Index of Industrial Production IIP

 It is noteworthy that in the recently announced foreign trade policy, the government has set an ambitious target of increasing exports by 20 percent in the current financial year
 raav ne kaha ki koi samaadhaan dhundne ke liye apni ranneeti ko phir se tay kar rahaa he
 This poor performance on the export front has come at a time when industrial production in April is just 0
 1 pratishat badhaa
 Rao said that the shortfall in demand, especially in the euro zone economies such as India's traditional markets, is having an impact on exports
 unhone kaha ki ham sankat se baahar nahin he or yunaan tathaa spain ko raahat paikaj kaa maamla abhi kaam jari hone vaala he
 Exports of major commodities such as petroleum products, engineering goods, gems and jewelery and readymade garments remained relatively low in May

 We will publish it on Aaj Tak's website
 hajaare ne apane anshan sthal ramlila maidan main samarthakon ko duusari baar sambodhit karte hue kaha ki isamen koi andeh nahin he ki sarkaar ko ek na ek din jan lokapal bananaa hi hoga kyonki ab janata kii sansad khadi ho gai he
 Even if it takes ten years, the people's parliament will change this country
 kya he jan lokapal bill?hajaare ne sansad main lokapal ke mudde par ho rahi charchaa ke sambandh main kaha kii agar jan lokapal ke vishay main unke uthaae teen muddon par netaaon ne virodh kiya to vah puure desh main yatra kar yah jaagrukta faillaayenge ki aise netaaon ko dubaara chunakar nahin bheja jaae
 If there is a protest then we have to teach the leaders a lesson in the coming election
 anna ke samarthan main utraa jansailabaunhone kaha ki ham galati nahin duharaayenge
 We have to maintain awareness
 vidhansabhaayen or sansad lokshahi kaa pavitra mandir hai or hamen unki pavitrataa banaae rakhni he
 Hazare said that the people's representatives did not execute the constitution properly
 vishesh kaverepanna ne kaha ki samvidhan main likhaa he ki 'ham bharat ke log' usamen yah nahin likhaa ki ‘ham sansad ke log
 'the people trusted their representatives but the constitution was not implemented properly
 gandhivadi kaaryakarta ne kaha ki kya ab janata kii sansad bhrashtachar mukt bharat kaa nirmaan karegi? kya ab garibon, kisaanon ko insaaf milegaa? The results of the Lok Sabha elections 2019 have created a panic in the Congress
 party ko itani karaari haar mili he ki naubat congress adhyaksh pad se rahul gandhi ke istife tak pahunch gai he
 In this sequence, a meeting of the Congress Working Committee has been called in Delhi today
 khabar he ki is baithak main jahaan haar par manthan hona he, vahiin rahul gandhi apane istife kii peshkash bhi kar sakate hai
 After the results came on 23 May, Rahul Gandhi claimed responsibility for the defeat
 rahul gandhi ke istife par abhi tak teen tasviren nikalakar saamne aa rahi hai
 1-the first picture is that Rahul Gandhi will offer resignation from the post of president, taking responsibility for the Congress' debacle in the Lok Sabha elections, but the people of the Congress Working Committee can reject Karari as a collective responsibility
 baithak main aisa hone kii sambhaavna he
 2-the second picture after this is that Rahul Gandhi's resignation will be accepted
 is haar ke baad congress par aatmapareekshan kii jarurat he or congress isse pressure main bhi he
 Therefore, there is a possibility that the resignation of Rahul Gandhi may be accepted by the Congress Working Committee
 agar aisa hota he to captain amarinder singh, ashok gahalot or mallikarjun khadge ke naam kii charchaa pehle se hi he
 In such a situation, one of the three leaders can be given the command of the party
 sutron se mili jaankaree ke mutabik, aisa hone kii bahut kam sambhaavna he
 3-third picture and most likely Rahul Gandhi should not resign
 party khud ko kamjor nahin dikhaanaa chaahegi
 Even before this, the party has denied the talk of Rahul Gandhi's resignation
 ho saktaa he ki is baithak main chunaavon main party ke pradarshan par charchaa ho or iske pareekshan ke liye ek alag se cameti bana di jaae
 The Working Committee can pass a resolution to reform, strengthen the party
 aise main aaj kii baithak se kya nikalakar aata he, is par philhal sabaki najar he
 The NDA alliance got 353 seats in this Lok Sabha election, while the UPA alliance settled on 91 seats
 in chunaav main sabase badi baat rahi ki rahul gandhi apni upi kii amethi seat bhi haar gaye
 Apart from this, the Congress had to satisfy itself in only 52 seats
 westeindies ke cricket premiyon kaa maananaa he ki sachin tendulkar kaa yahaan ke daure par nahin aane kaa faisla sahi he
 a fan who came to buy the tickets for the first two odis between India and West Indies at Queen's Park Oval said that the misery of West Indies cricket, he could have scored his 100th international century and maybe two more
 iske bajaay unhone ise majboot pratidwandvi england ke khilaaf hasil karnaa uchit samajha jahaan cricket premi unhen vahaan aakhri baar dekhne ke liye kaaphi sankhya main stadium pahunch sakate hai
 He said, at the age of thirty-eight, most batsmen want to play against weaker teams but Sachin wants to help India in the prestigious series instead of playing against the West Indies
 tendulkar ne apane parivaar ke saath kuch samay bitaane ke liye westeindies daure par nahin aane kaa faisla kiya
 He will be available for the tour of England
 ek anya prashansak ne kaha, unka shaayad yah maananaa he ki bharat kii duusare darje kii team bhi westeindies ko haraa sakati he
 India will play one Twenty20 international, five odis and three Test matches in the West Indies tour

 qatl ke peeche lav angel yaa hani trepaghatana ke baad prashanth vihaar thane kii police maukey par thi or aanan-faanan mangolionka shikaar hue shaks ko uthaa kar paas ke ambedkar aspataal main pahunchaaya, lekin doctoron ne use murda qaraar de diya
 Even the matter seemed to be due to murder due to some old enmity
 kuch logon ko is qatl ke peeche lav angel yaa hani trep jaisi baat bhi lagi, kyonki makatool ke saath ek ladki bhi mauka-e-vaardaat par pahunchi thi or qatl ke dauraan hi wo ladki bhi maukey se rahasyamayi tareeqe se gaayab ho gai, lekin thodi hi der baad jab maranevaale kii pahchaan saafe hui, maamle main bada tivest aa gaya
 The driver of the MLA who died was none other than Vipin Sirohi, a 25-year-old youth living in Jhadoda Kalan village in South West Delhi
 vahi vipin jo kabhi vidhayak bharat singh kaa driver hua karata tha or unki qatl kaa chashmadid gavaah bhi
 The murder of Bharat Singh, the brother of gangster-turned-politician Kishan Pahalwan, was also killed by his enemies in some similar manner on March 29 this year, when he reached Najafgarh area to attend a family function
 aise main ye maamla ab sirfranjish, lav afair or hani trep jaisi baton se bhi kahin aage bad lag rahaa tha
 The mysterious character of the girl, the driver of police officer Bharat Singh, who was in police trouble and the witness of his murder, Vipin Sirohi, had his enemy gunned down by bullets, but was it only his eye witness? Or the story of this murder was something else
 gangvaar par maathapai kar rahi police ko mauka-e-vaardaat par saamne ai ek rahasyamayi ladki kii kahani ne or bhi ulajhaa diya
 The shootout, which took place outside the Japanese park in Rohini has confused the Delhi Police
 vaardaat ke taur-tareeke or makatool ke puraane trek record ko dekh kar maamla gangvaar kaa lagata he
 But the mysterious character of a girl involved in this incident has emphasized the police presence
 aise main ise lekar philhal kai sawaal--kya ye vaaki gangvaar kaa nateeja he?--agar haa, to kya ye gangvaar main hani trep kaa istemaal he?<p>--kya purv vidhayak bharat singh ke qatl kaa chashmadid gavaah hone kii vajah se hi vipin kii jaan lee gai he?--kya ye vipin ke saath kisi kii koi or ranjish kaa anjaam he?--yaa phir qatl ke peeche rishton kii uljhi paheli yaa lav afaire kii kahani he?vipin nazagarh ke purv vidhayak bharat singh kaa driver tha or isi saal 29 march ko jab ek party main bharat singh kaa qatl hua, tab vipin naa sirf khud hi bharat singh gaadi chalaata hua party vaali jagah yani mauka e vaardaat par pahunchaa tha, balki usne tamaam qaatilon ko qareeb se bhi dekha tha
 In such a situation, Vipin was also one of the four people who were made eyewitnesses of the murder of Bharat Singh
 vipin kii saalon se bharat singh or unke bhai kishan pahalwaan se nazadiiki se bhi ye lag rahaa tha ki wo adaalat main qaatilon ke khilaaf ek majboot gavaah sabit hoga
 Is it not because of this that the murderers chased and killed Vipin
 kahanevaale kah sakate hai ki chaar main sirf ek gavaah kii jaan lene se maamle par vaisaa koi asar padana mumkin nahin he, lekin logon kaa kahana ye bhi he ki jis tarah sareshaam vipin kaa qatl kiya gaya, usase duusare gavaahon kaa bhikhofazadahona lazimi he
 Who is that girl? The puzzle of a mysterious girl present with Vipin between this feud and gang-war has entangled the police
 sabase bada sawaal to yahi he ki vipin ke saath bike se japani park pahunchi ladki akhir koun thi? vaise to vipin shaadishuda tha
 But is she a girlfriend of Vipin, someone knowledgeable or a relative? The question is also that why did the girl disappear mysteriously at the time of the murder? If she had a girlfriend or relative of Vipin, she could have pleaded with the killers to spare Vipin's life
 lekin aisa karne ke bajaay wo jis tarah maukey se bhaag khadi hui, wo shaq paidaa karata he
 In such a situation, the police feel that if Vipin was not caught by his enemies through this girl, that is, was it the use of honeytrap in the gang-wise? By the way, it is also a curious thing that in the accusation of Bharat Singh's murder Currently his enemy number one Udayveer Singh Kala and most of the gang miscreants are behind bars
 aise main agar is vaardaat main kaala kaa hi haath he, to kya iske liye kaala ne supaari di he yaa phir kaala kii tarah hi bharat singh or kishan pahalwaan ke kisi or dushman ne vipin ko apana nishaanaa banaaya he? qaatilon ne jis tarah bharat singh murder cese ke chashmadid gavaah vipin sirohi ko saream peechha kar maut ke ghat utaara, usne bharat singh ke qatl kaa vakya bhi tazaa kar diya
 This story of gang war in Najafgarh, Delhi is not 25 years, but 25 years old
 jab dilli tezi se tarakkee kar rahi thi or bhu-mafiaon ne oune-paune daam par karodon kii zamin kaa sauda shuru kar diya tha, lekin zamin kii isi saudebaazi ne tab ke bahubaliyon ke bich dushmani kii aisi beej daal di ki uskaa anjaam aaj bhi dikh rahaa he
 The gang war that killed the former Najafgarh MLA Bharat Singh started not a year or two, but almost 25 years from today, when Bharat Singh and his brother Kishan Pahalwan took the first step in the world of crime Was
 isse pehle dilli main gangvaar kaa kabhi koi itihaas nahin rahaa, lekin kishan pahalwaan ne tezi se sona banati zamin or praparty ke khel main raaton-raat paisa banane ke liye jurm kii andhi galiyaaron se kuch aisi daud lagaai ki phir kabhi isse baahar nahin nikal sakaa or apane bhai kishan ke saath-saath bharat singh bhi jurm ke in galiyon se guzar kar daulat or shoharat batorte rahe
 It is another matter that Bharat Singh's identity was slightly different and clean compared to his brother, probably due to which Bharat Singh succeeded in gaining a quick foothold in the world of politics than his brother
 unhone pehle dichaau ward se nigamparshadka chunaav jeeta or tab 2008 main pehali baar vidhayak bane
 However, some 25 years ago, the two brothers had their first feud with anoop-balraj gang, the same anoop-balraj, who was trying to establish his foot in the world of crime like kishan-bharat and after that when between these brothers- When and where, how many times the clash took place, no one got the exact account of it, with time anoop-balraj's legs were uprooted, but kishan-bharat had become the expert player of this game by then and his enemies
 That had created a new breed
 jeenyu main deshvirohi naare lagane ke maamle main kendriya grahamantri rajnath singh ne sakhti se kaha ki jo pakistan jindabad bolegaa wo jail jayega

 main apane prashansakon se chahta hum ki ve chintaa naa karen or kisi bhi tarah kaa sanshay man main naa paalen
 It has been over 45 years since i worked in films

 Ashwini Upadhyay has filed a petition in the Election Commission demanding that the name, photo and educational qualification details of the candidates should be changed on the ballot paper and EVM machine instead of the election marks of the parties
 unhone kaha ki aisa hone par har pratyaashee ke saath samanta kaa bartaav hoga
 In a 21-page petition filed in the Election Commission, Ashwini Upadhyay has asked the Chief Election Commissioner to remove the election symbol of the parties from the EVM using the powers of Article 324
 unhone kaha he ki yah swatantra evam nishpaksh chunaav ke liye jaruri he
 Upadhyay believes that now independent candidates have to bear the loss of those contesting elections on the symbol of major parties
 upaadhyaay kaa kahana he ki chunaav chinh mukt iviem se matadaataaon ko eemaandaar, parishramee, sakasham or janata ke liye samarpit ummidavaaron kii pahchaan karne main hi madad nahin milegi balki raajnneeti se 'apradheekaran, jatvaad, sampradayawad, bhashavad, kshetravaad, vanshavaad or parivaarwaad' ko samaapt karne main bhi bahut madad milegi
 It is very difficult to choose the right candidate, he said that it is very difficult to choose the right candidate by the voters at the present time
 yadi kisi raajnneetik dal kaa mukhiya to eemaandaar or mehnatee he lekin uskaa ummidavaar gunda badmaash bhrashtachari balaatkaari jamaakhor milawatkhor yaa taskar he to matadaata asamanjas main pad jaataa he
 The same problem arises if the candidate is good but the party high command is a convict
 ashvini upaadhyaay ne maang kii he kichunaav chinh mukt ivim ke upyogse chunaav main kalaadhan or benami lenden par niyantran lagegaa or bhartiya loktantr rajnatik dalon or unke aakaaon kii pakad se aaazaad hoga
 Using the candidate's name, age, educational qualification and his / her photo in place of the election symbol on the ballot paper and EVM will curb the arbitrariness of the heads of political parties in ticket distribution and the political parties will be forced to give tickets to those people
 nirdaleey ummidavaaron kaa nuksaanaunhone yachika main kaha ki chunaav ayog dwaara manyata praapt dal puure paanch varsh apane chunaav chinh kaa prachaar prasar karte hai, lekin swatantra ummidavaaron ko 30 din pehle chunaav chinh aavantit hota he
 Therefore, in the present system, the basic spirit of the constitution is 'violation of equality, equality and equal opportunity'
 apni yachika main upaadhyaay ne daleel di he ki chunaav chinh rahit ballat paper or iviem ke upyog se raajnneetik dal parasut pratyaashiyon ko tikat nahin denge or vanshavaad or parivaarwaad par bhi bahut had tak niyantran lagegaa
 He said that the use of ballot paper and evms without election symbol will not only control the criminalization of politics, but will also eliminate the sale of tickets and will also close the shops of political brokers
 isse samjik kaaryakartaaon, shikshavidon or saamaajik sarokaaron se jude logon ke liye raajnneeti main pravesh karnaa aasaan ho jayega
 When honest, qualified and dedicated people go to Parliament and Assembly, good laws will be made for public welfare
 saath hi unhone yaachik main kaha ki isse yogya or samarpit saansad apane kshetra main saansad nidhi kaa prabhavi upyog karenge or sansad or vidhansabha kii kaaryakshmata 10 guna tak bad jaaegi
 This will curb regionalism and linguism, which has become a great threat to our country

 Parmeshwar has accused BJP of tampering evms in the Karnataka assembly elections
 unhone kaha ki bijepi ne kai siton par iviem se chhedchhad kii jiske kaaran kai siton par majboot pakad ke baad bhi congress ko haar jhelni padi
 He also said that we will pass the floor test on Friday with an absolute majority
 unhone kaha, 'mujhe nahin lagata ki mujhe upmukhyamantri kaa pad isliye mila kyonki main dalit hum
 It is a mere coincidence that i am a Dalit
 ' unhone kaha, 'hamaare kuch netaaon ne or khud maine bhi yah mahasoos kiya ki bijepi ne iviem ke saath chhedchhad kii he
 In Karnataka, the Congress lost many seats where the party had a strong hold
 ham chunaav ayog main isaki shikaayat karenge

 'nahin tootenge hamaare vidhayak, floor test main honge paas: parameshwaraparameshwar ne kaha ki hamaari siton kii sankhya kam rahi lekin vot pratishat bijepi se zyada rahi

 He said that Chief Minister Kumaraswamy has already said that we will work together

 Because the previous BJP government has been corrupt
 unhone kaha ki hamane paanch saal tak chalane vaali sthir sarkaar di
 He also said that all sections of the society should be uplifted
 unhone kaha ki gathbandhan main shaamil donon partiyon ke alag-alag lakshya hai
 We will focus on issues that are important to both parties

 Normally, the Governor speaks of proving majority to the party forming the government in the state when they know that the party forming the government does not have enough majority
 floor testake jariye yah faisla liya jaataa he ki vartmaan sarkaar yaa mukhyamantri ke paas paryaapt bahumat he yaa nahin
 The elected legislators decide the future of the government through their votes
 floor test sadan main chalane vaali ek paardarshee prakriya he or isamen rajyapal kaa kisi bhi tarah se koi hastkshep nahin hota
 It is very important for the party in power to prove its majority in the floor test
 aapako bataa den ki karnataka main 222 siton ke liye hue vidhansabha chunaavon main bijepi 104 siton ke saath sabase badi party banakar saamne ai he
 In the political drama in Karnataka, the first Governor Vajubhai Vala administered the oath of office to BJP leader BS Yeddyurappa as CM
 haalanki, floor test se pehle hi unhone istipha de diya
 After this, Kumaraswamy of JDS (37 mlas) took oath as CM on Wednesday with the support of 78 Congress mlas and 1 MLA of Bahujan Samaj Party

 Once again the monsoon has cheated
 kerala main buudhvaar ko monsoon pahunchnaa tha lekin abhi tak monsoon nahin aayaa he
 The Meteorological Department has now predicted a monsoon knock on June 7
 vaise kerala main zyaadaatar ilaakon main ruk-ruk kar barish ho rahi he
 But experts are describing this rain as pre-monsoon
 jaankaron ke mutabik monsoon kii hawaaon ne pichley 24 ghante main teji pakadi he or isaki raftaar main ab teji aegi
 Cyclone Ronu stopped DDGM BP Yadav of the Kadam Mausam Department of the monsoon says that the monsoon winds have shown their impact in Andaman and Nicobar
 yahaan par zyaadaatar jagahon par monsooni barish kaa silsilaa jari he
 The monsoon knocked here on 17 May
 lekin 19 may ko bengal kii khadi main paidaa hue cyclone ronu ne badhate hue monsoon ko roak diya
 Cyclone Ronu spoiled the pattern of monsoon winds and due to this the monsoon is delayed in reaching Kerala
 monsoon nahin aane se rajasthan main bheeshan garmicyclone ne jahaan ek taraf monsoon kaa khel bigaada to vahiin duusari taraf rajasthan membhishan garmiko paidaa kar diya
 The change in wind conditions and direction due to Cyclone Ronu in Rajasthan raised the temperature to above 50 degrees Celsius and the heat in India set a new record
 jahaan ek taraf cyclone ronu ne monsoon ko rulaa diya to vahiin duusari taraf isaki nam hawaaon ne uttar bharat main garaj ke saath barish kaa silsilaa shuru kar diya
 This triggered a period of decline in temperature in northwest India including Rajasthan
 may kaa ant aate-aate monsoon ke global system kii hawaaen kamjor bani rahi
 But the beginning of June has once again brought heat to North India and with this the monsoon winds have also picked up
 monsoon kaa shabdic arthdarasal monsoon kaa matlab sirf barish nahin hota he
 The full scientific name of monsoon is Southwest monsoon
 bharat main june se lekar sitambar ke maheene main hone valibarish ko monasoonaki barish mana jaataa he
 The monsoon is the global weather system
 global wedar system isliye kyonki monsoon kii hawaaen bumadhyarekha se shuru hoti hai or inke banane main dharti ke alag-alag hisson kaa wedar mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaataa he
 For example, in the formation of monsoon, pressure on the South Pole, air pressure over Tibet, Atlantic Ocean temperature, Pacific Ocean temperature, Arabian Sea pressure and water temperature in Bay of Bengal is also a factor
 If not, then the monsoon situation goes awry
 mausam vibhaag keemansoon par paini najargauratlab he ki pichley do saalon se monsoon kii sthiti kharaab rahi he lekin is baar mausam vibhaag monsoon saamaanya ke mukaable acha rahane kii bhavishyavaanee kii he
 In such a situation, the late monsoon in Kerala means that if the forecast of the Meteorological Department is correct, it will rain every time the monsoon arrives
 mausam vibhaag ke mutabik bumadhyarekha se monsoon kii hawaaon ne phir se jor pakad liya he
 All the monsoon monitored weather models are showing that around June 6, the winds from Kerala, Karnataka and Goa will pick up the rains from the humid winds coming from the south-west direction and along with that the winds from the Bay of Bengal in northeast India Will move towards iskaa sidhaa sa sanket ye he ki monsoon 7 june ke aasapaas bharat main dastak de degaa
 Dabangg leader Akhilesh Singh, a five-time MLA from Uttar Pradesh's Rae Bareli Sadar seat, was suffering from cancer for a long time
 mangalvaar kii subah lakhanu ke pijiai main unka nidhan ho gaya
 He started his political journey with Congress
 lekin hatya jaise sangeen maamle main naam aane ke baad akhilesh singh ko congress ne party baahar kar diya tha
 Despite this, he was an independent MLA several times
 akhilesh singh kaa naam us vakt charchaaon main aayaa tha, jab un par saiyad modi kii hatya kaa aarope laga tha
 The Syed Modi massacre brought a storm in the politics of UP in the eighties
 baat 28 july 1988 kii he
 Famous badminton player Syed Modi was walking out of Lucknow's KD Singh Babu Stadium after practice
 tabhi goli maar kar unki hatya kar di gai thi
 The assassins who were ambushed there fired 8 bullets at them
 saaf tha ki goli chalaane vaale nahin chaahate the ki saiyad modi kisi bhi haal main jinda rahe
 The killers had also succeeded in their plan
 shuruaati jaanch ke baad maamle ko sibiai ko saunp diya gaya
 During the initial investigation in the Syed Modi assassination, the name of the then Janam Morcha leader Sanjay Singh, who belonged to the royal family of Amethi, was revealed
 unka naam saamne aate hi us vakt upi kii raajnneeti main bhuuchaal aa gaya tha
 The eyes of the entire country were focused on the investigation of this high profile murder case
 har koi yahi jaananaa chahta tha ki aakhir kiske ishaare par or kisne is hatyakand ko anjaam diya
 In November 1988, the CBI filed a charge sheet in this case, in which a total of seven people were accused
 aropiyon main sanjay singh, amita modi or raibareli ke dabang akhilesh singh samet saat logon ke naam shaamil the
 There was a good friendship between Sanjay Singh and Akhilesh Singh
 donon saath main kaaphi vakt bitaate the
 The CBI had alleged that Sanjay Singh, Amita Modi and Akhilesh Singh had conspired to kill Syed Modi
 baaki 4 logon ne is hatyakand ko anjaam diya tha
 According to the CBI, Bhagwati Singh, who was riding in a Maruti car near KD Singh Babu Stadium, fired on Syed Modi with a revolver and the other accused Jitendra Singh supported him
 bataaya jaataa he ki saiyad modi, amita modi or sanjay singh ke bich gahari dosti thi
 Due to this friendship, the family of Sanjay Singh and Syed Modi also came very close to each other
 lekin saiyad modi ke katl ke baad khel, raajnneeti or rishton kii ek uljhi hui kahani saamne aa rahi thi
 The CBI alleged that the relationship between Sanjay Singh and Amita Modi was the reason for the murder of Syed Modi
 sibiai kaa kahana tha ki sanjay singh ne hi saiyad modi kii hatya ke liye apane saathi akhilesh singh kii madad lee
 Mercenary killers were sent to kill them
 adaalat main sanjay singh kii taraf se diggaj vakil ram jethmalani ne morcha sambhala tha
 After this, a legal battle was engulfed in politics, sports and relations
 saiyad modi murder cese kii jaanch jab puri hui to court main sibiai ke daavon kii dhajjiyaan ud gai thi
 The first blow to the CBI came when Sanjay Singh and Amita Modi challenged the charge sheet in the court
 phir in donon ke khilaaf pukhta saboot na hone kii vajah se seshan court ne sitambar 1990 main sanjay singh or amita modi kaa naam cese se alag kar diya
 The second setback came in 1996, when the Allahabad High Court acquitted key accused Akhilesh Singh
 aaropee jitendra singh ko bhi benefit of dout dekar reeha kar diya gaya
 Four of the 7 accused in this case were already released
 baaki bache amar bahadur singh kaa sandigdh haalat main murder ho gaya tha

 In such a situation, if Narendra Modi visits the temple, then his security arrangements will not be done properly

 Inquiries at the bank revealed that the money had come out of his account through check
 graahak hairaan tha ki usne jab koi check kaata hi nahin to paise kaise nikle
 The bank told him the number of the check through which the money was drawn
 iske baad jo baat pataa chali wo or bhi chaunkaane vaali thi
 The number that was written on the check was still present in the customer's check book
 ab chaunkane kii baari bank kii thi
 The bank was deeply shocked by the thieves of the check

 By the time the matter reached the police, the thieves had gone out of their reach
 bainkon kii neend hui haramb sawaal yah he ki bank ko dhokhaa hua kaise
 In the investigation so far, it has come to know that the checks that came to the bank were fake checks but they looked exactly like the real ones

 Surprisingly, the thieves even knew the number of the bank's check

 Describing it as a fascist move under the BJP government's diplomacy of saffronization of education, he has appealed to the public against the Chief Minister's announcement to teach 'geeta' in schools to protect secular and progressive values

 Initially, if the upper caste students were furious, the students of backward classes are angry after the withdrawal of reservation
 mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav kii samaj main nahin aa rahaa he ki kya kadam uthaaya jaae
 When he was accused of promoting Yadavs, he withdrew the new reservation policy, but now convincing the reservation supporters is proving to be a crooked heap
 haalanki mukhyamantri ke paas ab elahabaad haai court ke faisle kii dhaal he, lekin yah unka puri tarah bachaav nahin kar paa rahi
 The movement is gradually catching on

 With the results of the Karnataka Assembly elections, the picture now seems clear
 bijepi bahumat se kuch seat dur rukati najar aa rahi he
 Meanwhile, the Congress has played a big bet to stop the BJP
 congress ne jedies netaa kumaraswami ko siem banane par samarthan dene kaa elaan kar diya he
 Congress can take the post of deputy CM
 agsit pole ke baad jedies ko kingmekar bataaya ja rahaa tha, lekin ab kumaraswami king banate najar aa rahe hai
 The counting of votes in 222 seats of the state assembly with 224 seats began at 8 am on Tuesday
 shuruyaat main kaante kii takkar dikh rahi thi bijepi ne 100 kaa aankada to paar kiya
 But it remained a little far from the majority
 aise vakt main congress ne jedies ko aage kar sarkaar banane or bijepi ko rokane kaa daanv khel diya
 Two days had already begun to meet Sankarnataka Two days before the results of the election, political pieces were being fitted
 bijepi-congress donon jahaan ek taraf bahumat kaa daawa karte rahe, vahiin jedies kaa sahyog lekar sarkaar banane ke plan-bi par bhi kaam shuru ho gaya
 Because exit polls were pointing to hung assembly and JDS role would have become very important in case of hung assembly
 aise main jedies ke kumaraswami kingmekar sabit hote
 The Congress had played the Dalit CM on December 2, Chief Minister Siddaramaiah played the card of the Dalit CM
 siddharmaiya ne elaan kar diya ki agar party dalit siem banaati he to vah apni daavedaari chhod sakate hai
 On the other hand, JDS spokesperson also responded positively to the proposal
 congress party ke do bade netaa gulam nabi aaazaad or ashok gahalot sambhavit gathbandhan par baat ke liye somvaar ko hi bengalooru pahunch gaye
 Sonia Gandhi's call from Delhi went to Ghulam Nabi Azad when the situation was becoming that of a hung assembly
 sonia ne devgauda se baat kar jedies ko baahar se samarthan kaa elaan karne ko kaha
 It was here that the picture of Karnataka elections changed
 congress ke kareeb kyon jedies?bhale hi chunaav prachaar ke dauraan congress or jedies ke bich bayanon ke talkh tir chale, lekin donon dal swaabhaavik sahyogi najar aate hai
 JDS was founded in 1999 by HD Deve Gowda, parting with the Janata Dal
 janata dal kii jaden 1977 main congress ke khilaaf bani janata party se shuru hoti he
 Many of these parties and leaders later formed the Janata Dal
 karnataka main janata dal kii kaman devgauda ke haathon main thi
 Under his leadership, the Janata Dal formed the government with an absolute majority in 1994 and Deve Gowda became the Chief Minister
 congress se hi shuru hui thi devgauda kii siyasatado saal ke baad 1996 main janata dal ke netaa ke rup main congress ke samarthan se echdi devgauda 10 maheene tak desh ke pradhanmantri rahe
 If we go ahead, in 1953, Deve Gowda started his political career as a Congress leader as well, but for the first time he became an MLA as an Independent
 phir immergency ke dauraan jepi movement se jude or janata dal main aa gaye
 What was the situation in the previous elections? The JDS is in a separate existence in Karnataka and part of the Left Democratic Front in Kerala
 jedies, congress or bijepi donon ke saath milakar sarkaar bana chuki he
 In the 1999 assembly elections, JDS got 10 seats, while 10
 42 fisadi vot hasil hue the
 59 seats and 20 in 2004
 77 fisadi vot
 28 seats and 18 in 2008
 96 fisadi vot
 40 seats and 20 in 2013
 09 fisadi vot hasil hue the
 Deve Gowda's son HD Kumaraswamy had also formed a government in Karnataka with BJP, with the support of BJP in the state
 2004 ke chunaav ke baad congress or jedies ne milakar sarkaar banaai thi or congress ke dharam singh siem bane
 But in 2006 the JDS split from the coalition government
 phir bijepi ke saath baari-baari se satta sanbhaalane ke samjhaute ke tahatkumaraswami janvari 2006 main siem bane
 But instead of handing over power to the BJP the following year, Kumaraswamy sent the resignation to the governor in October 2007, following which the state came under President's rule
 haalanki, baad main jedies ne bijepi ko samarthan kaa elaan kiya
 B
 on 12 November 2007 under this agreement
 es
 Yeddyurappa became CM for 7 days
 yani bijepi ke saath jedies kaa gathjod kabhi majboot nahin ho paaya
 Why the JDS-BJP came out in different elections in the 2008 elections and the BJP formed an absolute majority government
 2013 main congress jiti or siddharmaiya siem bane
 After the formation of Modi government at the Center in 2014, there was talk of secular politics, then JDS changed its politics again
 14 april 2015 ko jedies or 5 anya dalon jediu-argedy-sapa-inelo or sajapa ne bijepi virdohi new janata party parivaar gathbandhan kaa elaan kiya
 But later the RJD-JDU split in Bihar and no concrete initiative came out regarding this alliance of Janata Parivar
 basapa, left front or ovaisi kii party jiske saath abhi jedies chal rahi he ve bijepi ke dhur virdohi maane jate hai
 In such a situation, going with the BJP will be considered an absolute political U-turn of the JDS
 2019 kaa aam chunaav itnaa kareeb he or shaayad hi jedies apni ranneeti main itnaa bada badlaav kare
 The dalit-muslim vote equation 19 percent of the Dalit community in Karnataka also matters
 dalit matadaata sabase zyada he
 Though there is a lot of division in this, JDS was keeping an eye on this vote bank in alliance with BSP
 chunaav main dalit vot lekar abhi jedies bijepi se duuri banaae rakhana chaahegi kyonki philhal dalit samudaay main essi / asti act main badlaavon ko lekar bijepi ke prati gussa he or jedies bispi ke saath milakar chunaav bhi ladi thi
 Apart from this, along with the Congress, the JDS also has a hold on the Muslim vote bank
 chunaav baad bijepi ke saath agar jedies gai to 2019 ke liye uski raah phir mushkil ho jaaegi
 That is why it was natural for Congress and JDS to come together
 samaajawaadee party pramukh mulaayam singh yadavane ek baar phir uttar pradesh kiakhilesh yadav sarkaarake mantriyon kii kaaryastylee par naaraazgi jataate hue kaha ki adhikansh mantriyon ne shaayad party kaa chunaav ghoshnaptr padhaa hi nahin he
 In his address at an event held at the official residence of Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, Mulamayan said that the election manifesto of SP is only 24 pages, but i have to say with great regret that many ministers of Akhilesh government have not read it
 mantriyon kii taraf dekhte hue mulaayam ne kaha ki mujhe isaki jaankaree he or abhi main puuchhuunga to kai mantri bataa nahin paaenge, ye bahut afsosna he

 Chief Minister Mayawati of the then Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) government introduced the 'uttar Pradesh Organized Crime Control (UPCOCA) Bill' in the Assembly
 vidheyak ke pesh hote hi vipakshi dal acroshit ho gaye
 During the discussion on the bill, the leader of the then Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Legislature Party, Hukum Singh said, "there is no freedom of any political person in this
 iskaa istemaal aparaadhiyon ke khilaaf nahin, balki pratipaksh ke netaaon kii aawaaj dabaane ke liye kiya jayega
 The bill passed through both houses of the Legislature to the Governor
 rajyapal ne ise tatkaaleen raashtrapati pratibha patil ke paas bhej diya, jinhone ise manjuuri dene se inkaar kar diya
 On 4 September 2008, the then BSP government withdrew the UPCOCA Bill
 abaki baar bhaajapa is kanoon ke paksh main thi
 On December 20, 2017, after the Question Hour, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath introduced the 'uttar Pradesh Organized Crime Control Bill' in the House at 12
30 pm
 apane bhaashan main mukhyamantri ne is prastaavit kanoon kii khubiyaan ginaayin
 Opposition leaders strongly opposed the bill
 ise mul adhikaron kaa hanan karne vaala bataaya
 Ten years ago, BSP chief Mayawati, who supported the bill, immediately issued a statement saying, "UPCOCA has been brought to suppress political opponents
 ''par vidhansabha main bhaajapa ke prachand bahumat ke aage vipakshiyon kii ek na chali
 The bill passed in the Legislative Council of the Samajwadi Party (SP) majority after passing the assembly
 vidhaan parishad ne is vidheyak ko pareekshan ke liye pravar samiti ke hawaale kar diya
 This bill brought to stop organized crime gave the opposition parties a chance to mobilize against the BJP
 jarurat kyon padleprail main jiladhikariyon ke saath video conferencing ke dauraan mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ko kai aparaadhon main ek sangathit giroh chalane kii jaankaree mili thi
 He then directed the Home Department to enact a law to stop organized crime
 grih vibhaag ne maharashtra, karnataka main sangathit aparaadh rokane ke liye bane kanoon ke saath upi main basapa sarkaar ke dauraan taiyaar kiye gaye vidheyak ke praavdhaanon kaa adhyayan kiya
 According to a Home Department official, the provisions of remand, punishment have been fixed in the 'UP Organized Crime Control Bill' in accordance with the MCOCA Act of 'maharashtra'
 karnataka coca ke daayre main vah vyakti aata he jisane das saal ke bheetar aparaadh kiya ho jabaki upicoca main paanch saal ke aparaadh kii seemaa rakhi gai he
 "apart from laws like the already existing Gangster Act, Gunda Act, why was there a need for a new law?" BJP government spokesperson and cabinet minister Srikant Sharma answers this, "the nature of crime has changed a lot in the last few years
 aatank, theke par hatya, taskari, phiroti ke liye apharan, bhoomi kabja, avaidh khanan jaise aparaadh ab apradhi ek sindicket banaakar karne lage hai
 There was no competent law to deal with them
 isiilie sangathit aparaadh par alag se kanoon bananaa padaa
 "in UPCOCA, an attempt has been made to crack down on organized crime through a total of 39 sections (see box)

 C
 dvivedi kehete hai, ''mujhe vyaktigat rup se jaankaree he ki teen purv police mahanideshkon ne apane kaarykaal ke dauraan sarkaar se upicoca lagu karne kii peshkash kii thi
 a political game is being played with this law
 ''maanavadhikaar hanan kii ashankaupicoca vidheyak kii dhara 2 main praavdhaan he ki kisi bhi soochna ko kisi bhi vidhik praadhikaar ke bina nahin diya ja saktaa yaa prakashit nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Through this, an attempt has been made to curb the media
 haalanki sharma spasht karte hai, ''sangathit aparaadh main sanlagn aparaadhiyon kaa mahimamandan nahin kiya ja sakegaa
 Before interviewing notorious criminals, permission of the concerned authorities will have to be obtained

 darapuri upicoca ke praavdhaan ko aatank nirodhak kanoon se bhi zyada kade karne or police ko bahut adhikaar dene (dekhen box) se maanavadhikaar ulanghan ke maamle badhane kii ashanka jataate hai
 "under UPCOCA, a man can be jailed for up to one year without trial in judicial remand," says Darapuri
 police remand main aaropee ko 60 dinon tak rakhane kii chhot dene kaa matlab he, pratadna ke maamle badhenge
 "human rights activists are of the opinion that if the police have caught any person wrong then they will not get advance bail or other facilities to prove their innocence
" kisi bhi aaropee ko bhagoda ghoshit karne kii karrwai karne kii bajaae police kurki kii karrwai ke fouran baad hi mukadmaa shuru kar degi jisase farji maamle aane kii ashanka he
 Darapuri says, "media freedom will be hindered by stopping the proceedings in open court
" immergency main bhi keval sarkaar adhikrut jaankariyaan hi chhapane kaa aadesh tha
 "rejecting all apprehensions," Sharma says, "to prevent arbitrary use of the law, the government has made arrangements for competent authority at the state and district levels
 ''vot bank saadhane kii jugat2007 main jab mayawati sarkaar ne upicoca vidheyak pesh kiya tha tab ise musalamaanon ke khilaaf hathiyaar mana gaya tha
 The reason was that in those days STF arrested many Muslim youth from Azamgarh in the name of spreading terror in which questions were being raised on the role of police
 apni pichhali sarkaar ke dauraan aatank ke virodh main fanse begunaah musalamaanon ko chhodie kaa nirnay lene vaali samaajawaadee party (sapa) upicoca ke virodh main sabase aage khadi he
 The SP has become very cautious with the way the BSP has infused Muslim votes in the civic elections
 13 disambar ko jaise hi yogi cabinet ne upicoca ke masaude ko manjuuri di, sapa ne bina deree kiye iskaa virodh shuru kar diya
 Ramgovind Chaudhary, leader and leader of the SP Legislature Party, says, "this law is being brought so that Muslims cannot dare to go to the polling booth
" ''sapa ke bahumat vaale vidhaan parishad ne upicoca vidheyak ko pravar samiti ke hawaale kar ise kuch samay ke liye lataka diya he
 Principal Secretary of the Legislative Council, Dr
 mohan yadav bataate hai, ''pravar samiti apni siforeeshon ke saath vidheyak ko vidhansabha bhejegi
 The Select Committee is an advisory committee
 isaki siforishein maanane ko sarkaar baadhya nahin he
 "since the BJP has a majority in the assembly, there will be no problem in getting this bill passed again
" sambhawatah agle bajet satr main is vidheyak ke paarit hone kii ummid he
 After this, there will be no delay in the permission of the Governor
 kanoon-vyavastha ke masale par aalochana jhel rahi yogi adityanath sarkaar shaayad ek kadak prashasan ke liye is vidheyak ko vidhaan mandal se bhale paarit karvaa le, par uske saamne sabase badi chunauti upicoca kaa durupyog rokane or iskaa nishpaksh dhang se istemaal karne kii hogi

 bihar kii rajdhani patna se mahaj 15 kilometre dur naubatpur ek jagah he, jahaan in dinon khauf or aatank kaa raaj kaayam he
 Five days ago, local shopkeepers are very apprehensive due to the firing in the area for extortion
 yaheen vajah he ki vaardaat ke baad se naubatpur kii dukaane band hai or bazaar sannaate se pasra hua he
 You will remember the 1996 film Dastaar Toh, in which the shopkeepers are forced to close their shops to vacate the land due to the horror of a crook named Katia
 aisa hi kuch haal in dinon naubatpur main dekhne ko mil rahaa he
 According to local shopkeepers, last Tuesday, some criminals entered a sweet shop in the area and fired indiscriminately and then left with waving pistols
 yah firing dukaan maalik serangadarimange jane ko lekar kii gai thi
 Despite complaining in this case, the police have not yet taken any concrete action
 dukandaaron kii maane to police ke paas vaardaat kaa sisitivi footage maujuud he, jisamen saaf taur par dekha ja saktaa he ki badmaashon ne dindahaade kis tarah se dukaan main ghuskar golibari kii thi
 The shopkeepers allege that the police have arrested a miscreant named Guddu and sent him to jail to crack the case
 mana ja rahaa he ki aparaadhiyon ko rajnatik sangrakshan praapt he, yahi vajah he ki police ne abhi tak is maamle main koi karrwai nahin kii he
 Shopkeepers say that there are many groups of criminals here who demand extortion from them and threaten to kill if they do not pay extortion money
 dukandaaron kii maang he ki jab tak police unhen suraksha muhaiyaa nahin karavaaegi, tab tak vah log apni dukaane nahin kholenge
 At the same time, the police argued that due to the busy Prakash festival, he could not take action against the accused
 is maamle main 2namajadsahit kul 9 logon par exiaar darj kii gai he
 The police have enough evidence against the accused
 police adhikariyon ne dukandaaron ko bharosa dilaate hue kaha ki jald hi sabhi aropiyon ko giraftaar kar liya jayega
 Obviously, despite the FIR being written, not taking any concrete action against the accused raises questions about the functioning of the police, and also puts a question mark on the credibility of the police

 If you are watching pornography using 'incognito mode' and thinking that no one will know about it, then you are wrong
 google, fasebuk or yahaan tak ki orecle cloud bhi aap par chupake se najar banaae rakhte hai
 Even when you switch to 'incognito mode' on a laptop or smartphone, the porn you watch is secretly monitored

 Investigations revealed that 93 percent of web pages are those that track and leak users' data to third-party organizations
 iske liye 'webbexre' naamak ek upkaran kaa upyog karke 22,484 sex websiton ko tatola gaya
 Researchers, who have identified 230 different companies and services tracking users in their sample, said, 'tracking on these sites is focused through a few key companies
 ' gaiyr-pornography-vishisht sevaaon main se google 74 pratishat citon ko trek karata he, orecle 24 pratishat or fasebuk 10 pratshit citon ko trek karata he

 The researchers said, 'jack doesn't know that' incognito mode 'only ensures that his browsing history is not stored on his computer
 vah jin citon par jaataa he, usase sambandhit online kaamon ko third-party treckers dekh or record kar sakate hai
 From the information accessed via Jack, these third-party trackers can also infer his sexual desires with the help of the urls of those sites

 Purple potatoes destroy the stem cells responsible for colon cancer and prevent the spread of this deadly disease, according to a new discovery
 america kii pencylvania state uniwarsity main khaadya vigyaan ke sahaayak professor jairam vanamala ne bataaya ki cancer kaa muqabla karne ke liye stem koshikaon par hamalaa karnaa ek prabhavi tarika he
 Vanamala, an alumnus of the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), said that people can compare cancer stem cells to the roots of bushes if they wish
 unhone kaha ki log bhale hi jhaadi ko kaat daalen, lekin jab tak jad bachi rahati he, ve phir ug aate hai
 Similarly, if the cancer stem cells are alive, the cancer will then grow and spread
 dhakartaaon ne shodh ke liye uble bangnee aalu kaa istemaal kiya ki kya subjiyon main pakane ke baad bhi cancer rodhi gun rahete hai
 In the first experiment, they found that boiled purple potatoes inhibit the proliferation of stem cancer stem cells
 shodhakartaaon ke anusaar bangnee rang ke aalu main kai padaarth aise ho sakate hai, jo pet ke cancer kii stem koshikaon ko khatm karne ke liye alag-alag tarah se kaam karte hai
 The comments vanamala ne suzav diya ki bangnee rang ke aalu ko cancer ke liye pehali or duusari rokthaam ranneeti main istemaal kiya ja saktaa he

 The defenders used boiled purple potatoes to research whether the vegetables have anti-cancer properties even after cooking
 pehle prayog main unhone paaya ki ublaa bangnee aalu pet ke cancer kii stem koshikaon ke prasar ko roktaa he
 According to researchers, purple potatoes may contain many substances that work differently to eliminate stomach cancer stem cells
 tippaniyan Vanamala suggested that purple potatoes may be used in the first and second prevention strategies for cancer
 pratham ranneeti kaa lakshya cancer ke pehle prabhaav ko rokna he, jabaki duusari ranneeti kaa lakshya rogiyon ko cancer se mukt karana he
