 pravaktaa kaa kahana he ki 23 or 24 june ko dakshin korea kii rajdhani tseol main newclear saplir group kii planry sammelan main bharat kii sadsyta kaa masalaa agenda main shaamil hi nahin he

 is masale par charchaa ho saki he
 The Chinese spokesperson said one thing that does not eliminate the possibility, but such arrows keep moving in the world of diplomacy
 yah bhi samajhnaa chahie
 On the pretext of nuclear non-proliferation, India tries to make a little more effort
 china ke alaava turki or dakshin africa bhi maanate hai ki parmaanu aprasar sandhi par hastakshar kiye bina bharat ko enesji kii sadsyta nahin milani chahie
 But China, Turkey and South Africa approved civil nuclear business agreements in 2008 with 48 NSG member countries
 hamen yah bhi dhyaan rakhana chahie
 The US which China has cited has appealed for India's membership
 jab patrakaron ne white house ke pravaktaa se poocha ki kya america ne china se bharat ke bare main baat kii he to jawaab aayaa ki anya sadsy deshon se baat kii he
 It did not say that there was talk with China
 is jawaab se yah zaahir hota he ki america bharat ke liye anya deshon se baat kar rahaa he
 Is China talking to other countries for Pakistan or is making its move by making a public statement
 kootnithik maamalon ko sirf is lihaaz se nahin dekhnaa chahie ki nateeja kaisaa aane vaala he
 In this way, also see what kind of trick is going on before the result
 pakistan ke akhabaaron main bhi enesji ke masale par china ke bayanon kaa khub vishleshan ho rahaa he
 The reputed newspaper Dawn has written in its editorial that Pakistan has been believing that without Pakistan, giving membership to India will start a military nuclear competition between the two countries
 jiske kaaran china bharat kii sadsyta ko rokna chahta he
 At the same time, China is also closely watching India's growing proximity to America

 In 2008, China was objecting to the objections of other member countries, but under pressure from the US, when all the countries went yes one by one, China also said yes
 magar is baar china apana pozishan saarvajinak karte ja rahaa he
 The comments da vir dot in website main andr small ne likhaa he ki is baar jaankaron ko lag rahaa he ki china ant tak apni raay nahin badalegaa
 Now the question is how far will China oppose
 enesji ke niyam ke tahat wo civillian newclear trade nahin kar saktaa, lekin tab bharat ko apwaad ke rup main chhot di gai thi
 Due to this, India can trade in terms of nuclear fuel and technology in a legal manner
 bharat ke akhabaaron main is masale par chape lekh padhenge to lagegaa ki china ke alaava kareeb-kareeb sabhi deshon ne samarthan kar diya he
 If you read Chinese newspapers, then most of the countries are opposing India
 newclear saplir group main bharat kii sadsyta kaa faisla june yaa july main nahin hone vaala he
 The Foreign Minister has also said that India will try to become a member by this year, but has India made Pakistan and Pakistan more restless with their activism

 There is something about which Pakistan is worried

 ' On the ceilings released from December 2017 in Delhi, the BJP leader has written to PM Modi not only about the agencies responsible for the sealing but also suggested to stop the sealing
 ekikrut emsidi main workars cameti ke chairman rah chuke jagadish mamagai ne piem modi ko patr likhakar bataaya he ki dilli main jari ceiling ko kis tarah se vipakshi rajnatik dal siyaasi rang dekar iskaa phayda uthaane main lage hai
 Mamgai described in the letter how Congress policies are responsible for unplanned dispersal and sealing of Delhi
 mamagai ne likhaa ki pichhali baar jab ceiling shuru hui thi to kendra kii congress sarkaar ne dilli ke niojit vikaas ke prati gambhirtha dikhaane va ceiling se sthaayee samaadhaan kii bajaae 20 may 2006 ko rashtriya rajdhani kshetra dilli(vishesh praavdhaan) adhinium 2006 ko ek varsh ke liye adhishuchet kar asthaayee samaadhaan diya
 Apart from this, Mamgai said that it was appropriate to impose a penalty of 10 times the Central Government's Congress Government as penalty on those who did not submit conversion charge in Master Plan 2021? In the letter, Mamagai charged the conversion charge if the medium traders could not deposit Rs 2 lakh of conversion charge for example due to financial pressure, they would have to pay a penalty of Rs 20 lakh and interest extra
 Questions have also been raised about the rates
 mamagai ne likhaa ki pichhali baar jab 2538 sadaken adhishuchet hui thim, tab kanvarjan charge kaaphi kam or vyavhaarik tha
 The maximum for the a category was Rs 6174 per square meter but on 10 July 2012, the then Central Congress government raised it from Rs 6174 per square meter to 1500 times Rs 89,000 per square meter
 isse raashi itani adhik ho gai ki bhugtan karnaa vyapaariyon ke liye kaaphi mushkil ho gaya
 Jagdish Mamgai has also given suggestions to PM Modi to stop the sealing in Delhi, in a letter written to PM Narendra Modi
 jinamein bataaya gaya ki dilli kii sabhi markiton ke kanvarjan shulk kam hone chahie
 Those who are practical and traders can pay without any burden
 master plan 2021 main kanvarjan charge jamaa na karne waalon par 10 guna kii penlti samaapt kar ise 10 –20 pratishat kiya jaae
 The mandatory to deposit a sum of Rs one lakh from those applying for de-seal should be removed
 karrwai galat sabit hone par sampatti dharak ko uske nuksaan kaa muaavja diya jaae
 More than 90 percent of the buildings in Delhi are unauthorized, residential establishments operating on 2538 roads notified by the Union Urban Development Ministry and DDA are in illegal constructed buildings only
 yadi unka kanvarjan charge jamaa ho to building or floor ke nakshe paarit hone va bhawan adhinium kii sharten puri karne kii anivaaryta na ho
 In the end of a letter sent to PM Modi raising questions on the police action in Lajpat Lagar, Jagdish Mamgai has written that Union Urban Development Minister on the assault and abuse of local citizens and media photographers by Delhi Police in Lajpat Nagar in the name of sealing on March 8 It is not fair to tell businessmen guilty by the venerable Hardeep Singh Puri and give clean chit to Delhi Police without investigation purvi dilli ke ek kaarkaane main aag lagane kii ghatana main jaan ganvaane vaali sangeeta devi darasal aswasth hone ke kaaran shanivaar ko kaam par nahin janaa chaahati thi, lekin do din kii mazdooree jane ke dar se vah beman se kaam par chali gai thi

 Team India could not take advantage of this despite being in a good position against South Africa in the Port Elizabeth ODI match on Tuesday
 bhartiya team kaa pehla wicket 48 ran par gira to duusare wicket ke liye 100 ranon se zyada kii saajhedaari dekhne ko mili
 Rohit Sharma returned the in-form innings of 115 runs
 rohit ke alaava team india kii ore se bada score shikhar dhawan (34), viraat kohli (36) or shreyas ayyar (30) hi bana sake
 There were many shortcomings in the game of Team India, which if not fixed in time, the team may have to bear the brunt of this in the coming days
 1- lungi nagidi kaa tod nahilungi nagidi ne ek baar phir se team india kii naak main dam kiya
 The South African fast bowler sent Team India's century batsman Rohit Sharma (115), Hardik Pandya (00), Shreyas Iyer (30) and MS Dhoni (13) to the pavilion
 nagidi ne 9 over main 51 ran dekar 4 wicket apane naam kiye
 Earlier, Nagidi had given water to Indian batsmen by taking 6 wickets for 39 runs in the Centurion Test as well
 2- 10 ran banane main ganvaae 3 wicketbharat ne apane teen ahm wicket mahaj 10 ranon ke bheetar ganvaa die
 These wickets were lost by India between 42 and 45 overs
 lungi nagidi ne bharat kii ballebaaji kii qamar tod di or ek samay main 300 ke kareeb yaa iske paar ja rahi team india kam se kam 30 ran peeche rah gai or keval 275 ranon kaa lakshya de saki
 In the last five overs, the Indian team could add only 35 runs to their account
 3- 10 over main 4 wicket, 55 ranakhri 10 overon main bharat ne 55 ran banaae or 4 wicket ganvaae
 If the team has a good start, teams often score good runs in these slog overs
 haalanki, bharat or dakshin africa ke bich paanchaven vanade main aisa dekhne ko nahin mila
 Prior to the slog overs, India's score was 219 at the loss of 3 wickets, which at the end of the innings was 274 runs on 7 wickets
 4- antim 60 gendon main se 22 gayi khalislog overon main lagaataar wicket girane kaa asar rahaa ki bhartiya ballebaajon ne is dauraan 60 main se 22 gendon par koi ran nahin banaae
 Not only this, in these 10 overs, India did not get a single six, fours could only take four
 ek over main sabase zyada 11 ran bane to ek over main 0 or do overon main 2-2 ran bhi bane

 com / kr1ylk6k1s — Simon Kruse (@crusoes) August 24, 2015 mahendra singh dhoni ko captaini karte-karte kareeb aath saal ho gaye hai, or team ke bare main media ke saamne unhen sawaalon kaa jawaab dete-dete bhi itnaa hi vaqt ho chukaa he
 It seems that Dhoni could not have been a good politician if he were not a player, because you can never get a straight answer from him on any issue and the number of shots he has, more than the same excuse for different words There is also the art of saying by
 vaise cricket ke baad vah rajaneta nahin banenge, isaki bhi koi guarantee nahin he
 After losing two matches in a row to the England team in the tri-series and after being eliminated from the final race, Dhoni has said that he wants the players to lock their kit-bags and the rest of cricket and completely from cricket Take a break from
 baat to sahi he, ki har kisi ko brake kii zarurat to hoti hi he, chaahe wo khilaadi ho yaa patrkaar, par aakhir is team main brake chahie kise? Shikhar Dhawan's bat began to hit the ball for two months now that the captain talked about the break
 rohit sharma kii mansapeshiyon main khinchaav he or pehle se hi aaraam kar rahe hai
 Ishant Sharma is also resting on this tour after the first three Tests
 rabindra jadeja bhi aaraam karte-karte worldcup kii team kaa hissaa ban hi gaye hai
 Akshar Patel has only gone for one-day tour, that is, if there is no question of rest, Bhuvneshwar Kumar has also returned to the team after a long rest
 suresh raina ne sidney test main kul chaar genden khelin or vanade main bhi unke naam 54 ran hi hai, ab iske liye unhen kitna aaraam karnaa chahie
 Perhaps Captain Dhoni told the medicine in front of the media, but forgot to tell the disease
 shaayad vah yah bataanaa bhul gaye ki is vakt unke liye dressing room main viraat kohli or ravi shastri ke badhate kad se brake chahie
 Perhaps he forgot to say that Jadeja, Jin Shikhar and Jin Rayudu, who had betted on Dhoni all year, are now starting to disappoint him
 shaayad vah yah bhi bataanaa bhul gaye ki agar wo worldcup ke final main team india ko nahin pahunchaa paae to unke liye vanade main apni captaini bachaani mushkil ho sakati he
 All they need is a break, it has been more than two months that Team India went on Australian tour, but still the team has not got a single win
 test maichon main to hamaare paas videsho main haar ke bahaane taiyaar rahete hai, lekin vanade main mili naakaami ko phens abhi tak hazam nahin kar paae hai
 But irrespective of all this, captain Dhoni wants the team to lock his kit-bag for a few days now and distance himself completely from cricket
 
 Dhoni is not the only one who has such an opinion
 team india ke purv captain saurav ganguli ne yahaan tak kah diya he ki jo khilaadi bharat aakar apane parivaar ke saath samay bitaana chaahate hai, unhen isaki ijaajat milani chahie
 Despite all the criticism, the captain of Team India is confident that India will be fully ready when they get to play their first World Cup match against Pakistan on 15 February

 com / amzokbym36 — Wimbledon (@wimbledon) July 16, 2017 uttar pradesh ke bagpat jile ke niwada gaanv main teen maheene pehle hui ghar ke sadsy kii maut ke maamle main insaaf paane ke liye ek hemuslim parivaarake 20 main se 13 logon ne hindu dharm apana liya he
 The remaining seven people of this family have not changed religion
 inkaa kahana he ki police utpeedan or khud ke muslim samaaj kii upeksha ke chalatedharm parivartankia he
 During the conversion ceremony on Tuesday, Jai Shri Ram and Hara Har Mahadev shouted lots of cheers
 is dauraan vande maataram bhi gaaya gaya
 The interesting thing is that the police and administration kept distance from this program
 isse pehle somvaar ko kagaji kaarywahi puri kar lee gai thi
 Before the Havan-poojan, the altar was built, the Navagraha was worshiped and then the tilak was started
 iske baad dharm parivartan kaa kaarykram sampann hua
 What is the whole matter Akhtar Ali, resident of Badarkha village, left his village on 15 February 2018 and started living in village Niwada, 5 kilometers away
 pehle akhtar ali or ab dharm singh ke bete gulahasan kii 22 july ko bagpat ke niwada gaanv main maut ho gai
 The dead body was found hanging from the noose
 is hatya ke khulaase ke liye parivaar ke log police se mili, lekin aarope he ki police ne hatya ko aatmahatya darsha diya
 After this, the victim's family revolved around the police station, but justice was not granted
 isko lekarmuslim samaajaki panchayat bhi hui, lekin vahaan bhi inhen dutkaar diya gaya
 Due to police harassment and no help from Muslim society, the members of this family decided to adopt Hinduism
 inhone is sambandh main badot ke esadm ko baqayda affidavit diya
 After this, after coming back to Badarkha in his village, he converted to religion
 muslim parivaar ke 13 sadasyon ne apanaaya hindu dharmamuslim parivaar ke in 13 sadasyon nehindu dharupanaane ke saath hi apana naam bhi badal liya he
 Akhtar Ali's name was changed to Dharm Singh and his sons Diler Singh to Diler Singh, Naushad to Narendra and Irshad to poet
 dharm parivartan karne waalon main in inaki patniyaan, do pote or chaar potiyaan bhi shaamil he
 The young Hindu Vahini told that the whole program was completed with the support of the young Hindu Vahini India
 maamle main yuva hindu vahini ke jiladhyaksh yogendra tomars kaa kahana he ki in logon neghar vapasiki he
 The police administration and the administration maintained a distance from the police administration on the matter
 kaarykram khatm hua, to prasad bhi baanta gaya
 The whole village became witness to this conversion program
 ab yahaan sawaal yah he ki kya is parivaar ko dharm parivartan se insaaf milegaa? 'what kind of idea did you bring to the British Raj villagers and cricket? Don't even listen to any other producer
 mujhe ye lagaan bharne or cricket khilne vaale ydia main koi dilchaspee nahin he
 After hearing such words from Aamir Khan, no director would think of furthering this film but Ashutosh Gowariker is not one of the ordinary filmmakers
 paanch maheene baad ve phir aamir se mili the or unke manaa karne ke baavjood ashutosh ne aamir ko kahani sunai
 Aamir was quite surprised to hear this story
 ve jaanate the ki ye ek mushkil film he or iske liye fund jutanaa bhi mushkil hoga lekin is chunauti ko khud aamir ne sweekaar karte hue ise produs kiya or is tarah ashutosh ke is project kii shuruyaat ho pai
 However, despite being part of some of Bollywood's most challenging projects, Ashutosh is an outsider
 unhone na to koi filmuskool join kiya he or na hi ve kisi filmameking parivaar se hai
 His father is a police officer who was fond of films
 ashutosh soshal media par kaaphi kam active rahete he
 Ashutosh, who made historical films his USP, also did not like history in school
 ve chemistry kii degree ke saath mumbai ke mithibai college se passout hue the

 a post shared byaamir Khan (@_ aamirkhan) onjan 19, 2019 at 11:56 am PST Through Ashutosh's not giving up, he has established a distinct audience in Bollywood
 lagaan kii relies ke 18 saal baad bhi unka real lokations ke prati pishan saaf jhalkata he
 For his upcoming film Mohenjo Daro, he preferred to shoot in Bhuj instead of making sets in Mumbai
 ve apane craft ke saath kabhi compromij karnaa pasand nahin karte hai
 With the help of filmmaking, they also try to make their new world come true
 film jodha akbar ke liye agra ke kile kii oonchai ko 45 feet se 70 feet kiya gaya tha lekin bajet kii samasya ke chalate ise kam karne kii baat kahi gai haalanki ashutosh ne aisa karne se manaa kar diya tha
 From his wife to art director Nitin Desai, he tried his best but Ashutosh did not budge from his decision
 lagaan ke sets par unka accident bhi ho gaya tha or kai baar to unhone set par lete-lete hi diarection kiya tha
 Ashutosh's belief in his own stories and passion for realist locations makes him extremely different from the rest of the filmmakers

 congress ne pawan kumaar bansal or ashvini kumaar ko kendriya mantrimandal se hataae jane ko pradhanmantri manmohan singh or party adhyaksh sonia gandhi kaa ‘sanyukt faisla’ bataate hue in reporton ko khaarij kiya ki party adhyaksh ke jor dene par yah karrwai kii gayi he
 Party general secretary Janardan Dwivedi said, 'there has been a news in the media that two ministers from the Union Cabinet resigned on the insistence of the Congress President
 yah sach nahin he
 The actual position is that it was a joint decision between the Prime Minister and the Congress President
 ’unhone kaha, ‘sachaai yah he ki yah congress adhyaksh or pradhanmantri manmohan singh kaa sanyukt faisla tha
 This statement of Dwivedi, the head of the media department of the Congress, is important because there were some reports that seemed to be close to the Prime Minister on Friday after the Congress President expressed his displeasure over the continuation of Bansal and Kumar's posts
 The two cabinet ministers, Bansal and Kumar, were asked to resign
 in khabaron ko lekar pradhanmantri par nishaanaa sadhate hue varisht bijepi netaa laalkrishna adwani ne kaha tha, ‘kya pradhanmantri ne apane mantrimandal ke bare main faisla karne kaa bhi adhikaar tyaag diya he? do mantriyon ko hataae jane ke sambandh main aaj kii khabaren saamaanya taur par is baat par jor de rahi hai ki yah sonia ji hai jinhone ‘piem ke do aadamiyon’ ko hataaya he
 'advani wrote on his blog,' It is a matter of self-respect that the Prime Minister should order the general elections before time
 ’reporton main kaha gaya tha ki sonia gandhi kii pradhanmantri manmohan singh ke saath mulaakaat hui or samajha jaataa he ki congress adhyaksh ne rail mantri bansal or vidhi mantri kumaar ke khilaaf karrwai nahin karne ko lekar janata ke bich ban rahi avadharana par party kii asahajata jaahir kii
 Bansal resigned on Friday after the arrest of his nephew Vijay Singla last week for allegedly accepting a bribe of Rs 90 lakh for promotion to the Railway Board

 rang main bhang padana kahawat puraani he, lekin kuch aisa hi nai dilli nagar palika parishad yani endiemasi ke saath hua
 In fact, about a year and a half ago, the NDMC planted the dividers of the roads in its area and both sides were white, black and yellow with other colors
 trephic police is nae rang kii visibility kaa hawala dete hue kai baar endiemasi ko likh chuki he
 Now NDMC says that it will change these colors by keeping pace with the traffic police
 rajdhani kii sadakon kaa is tarah kaa bhagava rangarogan kya satta ke badale rang kaa asar he
 On one hand, while NDMC is connecting it with its greenery and identity on the occasion of the completion of hundred years, the traffic experts are calling it dangerous in terms of visibility
 tippaniyan Anurag Kulshrestha, president of Trace Road Safety NGO, says that it is fine during the day, but visibility is affected at night
 blike and white kaa kambination sateek he
 The question here is more of reflectivity than visibility
 white color jab blike ke saath hota he, to zyada riflact karata he jisase gaadi chalaane waalon ko pataa chal jaataa he ki yahaan divyder he yaa phir sadak kaa kinaaraa
 This reduces the risk of accident

 modi sarkaar ke shapath grahan samaaroh ke baad bihar kii raajnneeti kaaphi teji se badali he
 No JDU minister joined the Modi cabinet as Chief Minister Nitish Kumar termed the appointment of a minister as symbolic and decided that no JDU minister would take part in the central government even in future
 iske thik baad bihar main bhi mantrimandal kaa vistaar hua jisamen jediu ke 8 netaa mantri banaae gaye jabaki bijepi kaa koi vidhayak isamen shaamil nahin kiya gaya
 Now iftar politics is going on in Bihar in which everything is not looking good in BJP-JDU alliance
 yahaan alag alag partiyaan iftaar kar rahi hai jisamen virdohi gathbandhan kii raajnneeti bhi paravaan chadhati dikh rahi he
 Many leaders may be describing these events as separate from politics, but iftar party of this time is definitely different for next year's Bihar assembly elections
 pichley saal kii tarah is baar bhi purv mukhyamantri rabari devi ke awaas par iftaar kaa aayojan hua jisamen mahagathbandhan ke kai netaa dikhe
 The shocking thing is that Tejashwi Yadav, the younger son of Rabri Devi, did not appear under whose leadership RJD contested Lok Sabha elections this time and had to face a crushing defeat
 haalanki is iftaar main rabari devi ke bade bete tejpratap yadav jarur najar aae jo logon kii mehmanvaaji main lage the
 In Iftar, a statement came from quoting Rabri Devi that if Nitish Kumar is again involved in the grand alliance, he has no objection
 idhar, bihar main bijepi ke sahyog se sarkaar chalaa rahi jediu ne bhi ravivaar ko iftaar party di jisamen purv mukhyamantri or hindustani avam morcha (ham) ke pramukh jeethanram maanjhi to jarur shaamil hue lekin bijepi kaa koi bhi netaa yaa vidhayak nahin pahunchaa
 This has given rise to many questions, even though BJP leaders are talking about not taking away its political meaning, but 'talakhi' is definitely seen in the relationship
 duusari ore bijepi ke netaa ke bayanon se ulat congress ke netaa premchand mishra ne kaha ki bijepi or jediu ke ek-duusare kii iftaar party main nahin janaa endie kii sthiti ko spasht kar rahaa he
 On the one hand, BJP leaders in jdu's Iftar party do not know and on the other hand Rabri Devi's statement that if Nitish Kumar rejoins the Grand Alliance, he will not mind, many political matters are being extracted
 siyaasi galiyaaron main yah khabar chal padi he ki agle saal vidhansabha chunaav he jisamen jediu or argedy ke gathjod sambhav hai
 To strengthen this argument, people are also looking at the statement of Raghuvansh Prasad Singh in which he said that Tejashwi Yadav has not given in writing that Nitish Kumar cannot join the grand alliance
 raghuvansh singh ne yah bhi kaha he ki bijepi ko haraane ke liye sabhi dalon ko ek saath aana chahie
 The tussle between the JDU and the BJP began when the Chief Minister refused to include the JDU hours before the swearing-in ceremony of Narendra Modi's cabinet
 endie kii ore se maatr ek mantri banaae jane ko nitish kumaar ne sankethik bhagidaari bataaya or bijepi ke prastaav ko thukaraate hue mantrimandal main shaamil nahin hone kii ghoshnaa kii
 Two days later, Nitish Kumar expanded his cabinet in Bihar, which did not include a single BJP MLA
 jediu ne iske baad saaf kar diya ki bhavishya main bhi vah modi sarkaar kaa hissaa nahin banegi
 However, the political picture that is emerging in Bihar during Ramadan is indicative of changing parties in which Nitish Kumar will join which fact, it is not clear yet
 haalanki jediu se lekar bijepi tak kahati dikh rahi hai ki unka gathbandhan majboot he or aage bhi ve endie kaa hissaa bane rahenge
 Lok Sabha elections are over, exit polls have come and less than 24 hours left for results
 takreeban sabhi agsit pole main endie ko bahumat miltaa dikh rahaa he or sabhi ne ye bhavishyavaanee kii he ki narendra modi duusari baar sarkaar banane ja rahe hai
 The India Today Data Intelligence Unit analyzed 20 such seats, on which parties were elected, who formed the government after the last 5 Lok Sabha elections, so we are calling such seats a trend setting seat
 agar maujuuda agsit pole sahi hue to is baar chunaav baad kiye gaye survey main 5 aisi siten hai jo trend set karne kaa tamgaa kho sakati hai
 The impact of South India is that these five seats are from South India, which are missing the trend this time and are not electing the party that comes to power
 inamen teen siten andhra pradesh se ( kakinada, amalapuram or rajmundri), ek tamilnadu ( dharampuri) or ek telugana (sikanderabad) kii seat he
 In 2014, three seats in Andhra were won by Chandrababu Naidu's Telugu Desam Party
 telegu desham ne bijepi ke saath chunaav purv gathbandhan kiya tha, lekin march 2018 main wo endie se baahar nikal gai
 The TDP alleged that the Modi government did nothing to give special status to the state
 india today-exis maai india agsit pole ke mutabik kakinada, amalapuram or rajmundri se jagan mohan reddy kii party wiesar congress jeet rahi he
 If the exit polls are correct, then Jagan does not have a pre-poll alliance with any party, so the trend setting can be lost from these seats
 sikanderabad kii seat par philhal bijepi ke bandaaru dattatreya saansad hai or agsit pole ke mutabik ye seat tiares ko ja rahi he
 TRS led by k Chandrasekhar Rao had performed brilliantly in the last assembly elections
 party ne 119 vidhansabha siton main se 88 par kabja jamaaya tha
 TRS did not have any alliance with BJP in 2014 too and this time it is fighting alone
 agsit pole main ye seat tiares ke khate main jaati dikh rahi he isliye is seat se bhi trend setting kaa tamgaa hat saktaa he
 
 aakhri seat tamilnadu kii dharampuri he
 However, the exit poll has predicted a tough fight between DMK and bjp's PMK
 diemke ne yahaan se 41 saal ke dienvi senthil kumaar es ko ummidavaar banaaya he jabaki unka muqabla piemke ke abumani ramdaus se he
 bjp's victory on 15 trend setting seats decided misaal ke taur par gujarat kii valsad seat par 1977 se vahi party jeet darj karti rahi he jisaki sarkaar bani he
 This seat is reserved for Scheduled Tribes
 haalanki is seat par bijepi or congress ke bich kadaa muqabla he lekin agsit pole main bijepi ko badhat lete dikhaaya gaya he
 There is a fight between sitting BJP MP KC Patel and 4-time Congress MLA Jitu Bhai Chaudhary from Kaprada
 duusari trend setting siton main uttar mumbai kaa bhi naam he, jahaan congress ke tikat par mashhoor adaakara urmila matondkar kismat aajamaa rahi hai lekin agsit pole ke mutabik unki haar tay he
 At the same time, aap's Atishi is in the fray in East Delhi seat, which can lose the election against bjp's star candidate Gautam Gambhir
 iske alaava agsit pole main bihar, gujarat, haryana, jharkhand, himachal pradesh,jammu kashmir or maharashtra kii tamaam trend setting siton par bijepi or unke sahyogiyon kii jeet pakki dikh rahi he
 But everyone is waiting for the final results

 com / 1qbzcb3dca Some events changed the world
 inhen main ek sabase badi ghatana he - 2001 main neuyork main world trade centre par hua aatanki hamalaa
 Many books, articles, documentaries and films have been made so far keeping the story of this attack on America at the center
 har baar kalpana or tathyon ke jariye hamale ke peeche kii vajahon ko talashne kii koshish hui he
 Now, many years after this incident, a web series explores the reasons and mistakes behind the world's most dreaded terror attack
 jis web siries kii baat ho rahi he, uskaa tital he "da looming tower" ( The Looming Tower)
 The series has recently won several titles at the Emmy Awards
 kya he looming tower kii kahani ?american network company Hulu ne 9 / 11 hamalon ko lekar ye series banaai he
 The series is inspired by the famous writer Lawrence Wright's book The Looming Tower
 10 episod kii is series main bataaya gaya he ki 9 / 11 kii asli kahani darasal, kahaan se shuru hoti he
 The entire story is woven between the ongoing politics between the American Intelligence Agency CIA and the Security Agency FBI
 FBI kii anti terarysm unit ko hamale ke kareeb 8-10 saal pehle hi aatankiyon ke kuch bade plan kaa andeshaa ho jaataa he, lekin CIA unhen koi information sirf isliye nahin detii, kyonki use lagata he ki soochna paakar vah baaji maar le jayega
 The FBI team continuously works on these things in South Asia
 is bich afghanistan, libya or africa deshon main america ucchayog par hamale hote hai
 The investigation proceeds and the wires connect directly to the "al Qaeda"
 alqaida lagaataar america se badale kii dhamkee detaa he, is bich do saudi nagarikon ko train kar america bheja jaataa he
 Al Qaeda makes its terrorists enter America two to three years ago
 puri planning ke saath
 On the other hand, the CIA and FBI, despite knowing everything, fail to thwart the terrorists' plans
 or jab sabakuch ganvaakar epabiai kaa pramukh naukari chhod world trade centre kaa suraksha pramukh banataa he, agle hi din alqaida vahaan hamale kar detaa he
 The rest is now a painful history
 kyon khaas he ye series?abhi tak 9 / 11 ke mudde par kai tarah kii filmein dekhne ko mili he
 In most films, what happened on 9 / 11 and how the US finished Laden is only shown
 sambhavat: is series main pehali baar yah dikhaane kii koshish kii gai he ki kaise CIA or FBI kii aapasi ladaai main america jaisaa bada desh na chaahate hue bhi apni suraksha se samjhauta kar baitha
 It is interesting to see how the terrorists were preparing for this attack and how America was making mistakes on mistakes
 ye siries is sthapana ko bhi bal detii he ki agar siie or epabiai aapasi jhagade main na fanse hote to shaayad america kii aatanrik suraksha main aatanki send na lagati
 This series is in English
 ise dekhte hue kai baar lebanon, farsi or urdu main samvaad sunne ko milte hai
 This language problem does not seem to be heavy due to English subtitles
 haalanki 9 / 11 par kai kahaniyaan dekh chuke logon ko isaki kahani bor bhi kar sakati he
 The entire series revolves around 2-3 important characters
 sabase pramukh hai John o’neill jo epabiai ke anti terarysm unit ke pramukh hai
 John is played by Jeff Daniels, before which you saw him in TV series like The Newsroom
 unke alaava doosraa ahm kirdaar unke assistance Ali Soufan kaa he
 This character is played by Tahar Rahim
 unki acting kaaphi shandaar he or ek america-muslim ke kirdaar ko unhone jeevant tareeke se nibhaayaa he
 Apart from these, you will also like the work of Wrenn Schmidt, Bill Camp, Louis Cancelmi
 kahaan dekh sakate hai?vaise ye orijnel series Hulu ne banaai he

 The soldier says that some time ago his uncle and his people have beaten up his (soldier's) brothers and sister-in-law
 unke ek bhai ko mrit samajhakar choda gaya he or ek bhai ke bare main koi jaankaree nahin mili he
 In the video, Pramod Kumar is urging Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath to get the matter investigated
 video main pramod kumaar yah bhi kah rahe hai ki vah desh ke sipaahi hai, jab vah apane desh ke liye jaan de sakate hai tab apane bhaaiyon ke liye paan singh tomars bhi ban sakate hai

 1 july se puure desh main jiesti lagu hone ke baad se sone kii puraani jewelery ko paise yaa nai jewelery banavaane ke liye bechney par kya asar padegaa? bharat main sone kii jewelery kii ahmiyat ko dekhte hue aise bahut se log hai jo in afvaahon se pareshaan hai ki ab vah puraane sone kii jewelery ko bechnaa chahenge to unhen jiesti ke daayre main le liya jayega
 This rumor is also impacting gold traders
 jiesti lagu hone ke baad sone par 3 fisadi jiesti or jewelery mekking charge par 5 fisadi kaa levi lagegaa
 Customers and shopkeepers feared that the jeweler would have to levy GST at the rate of 3 per cent on buying from an old jewelery customer
 ise bhi padhein: paisa blike ho yaa white, sona donon kaa best friendlihaaja, yadi koi graahak 1 lakh rupee kii keemat kii puraani jewelery ko bechata he, us tranjaction se 3 fisadi kii dar se 3,000 rupee bataur jiesti kaat liya jayega
 By this, customers will get a lower price in exchange for their gold per transaction
 lekin, desh main sone kii puraani jewelery kii ahmiyat ko dekhte hue vitt mantri arun jetali ne safai di he ki afvaah he ki puraane sone kii jewelery ko bechney par kisi tarah kaa jiesti lagaaya jayega
 Jaitley said that in view of people's love for gold, old jewelery will not be imposed by section 9 (4) of the CGST Act, 2017
 ise bhi padhein: 2017 main tuutegaa myth 'nahin he sona sadaa ke liye'lihaaja, vitt mantri kii safai se saaf he ki jewelery kaarobaariyon ko graahakon se puraani jewelery ke liye koi tex nahin vasuulana hoga kyonki yah tranjaction jiesti se baahar rahegaa
 It is worth mentioning that the Finance Minister had to clarify on this issue because a day ago Revenue Secretary Hasmukh Adhia had explained that GST had to pay 3% tax on buying old jewelery
 haalanki jetali ne kaha ki is puraani jewelery par di gai is chhot kaa phayda jeweler na uthaa saken, isliye is tranjaction par sefti net kaa istemaal kiya gaya he
 Jaitley said that if a supplier of gold jewelery who has not been registered and sells the jewelery to a registered supplier, he will have to pay GST on the reverse charge mechanism at the rate of 3%

 haal ke dinon main congress alaakaman or himachal ke mukhyamantri virbhadra singh ke bich kii tanatani jagajaahir rahi he
 Virbhadra opened such a front after meeting the new in-charge general secretary, Sushil Kumar Shinde, with his opposition leaders in the state that Sonia Gandhi wrote letters to Rahul Gandhi and Ahmed Patel, which led to the controversy
 virbhadra singh ne khat main saaf likhaa ki agar pradesh adhyaksh sukhwinder singh sukkhu hataae nahin jaaenge to vah na chunaav ladenge naa party ko ladavaayenge
 After this, there was bound to be a stir in the Congress camp
 sutron ke mutabik, himachal ke prabharee mahasachiv susheel kumaar scindia ko uske baad jimmedaari saunpi gai ki, vah himachal congress kii aapasi uthapatak gutbaji or manmutav par kaabo paaen, jiske baad scindia ne sabhi pakshon se baat karne ke baad jo formula sujhaayaa wo ajtak ke paas he
 This will be the formula
 This is the formula on which the Congress high command has given its consent
 rahul ho yaa soniyaaya phir sonia ke sachiv ahamed patel sabhi kaa yah maananaa he ki, virbhadra himachal main hamaare sabase majboot netaa hai, lekin congress alaakaman ko adhyaksh hataane kii chunauti dena thik nahin, jiske baad hi scindia ne taiyaar kiya he wo formula jo aaj tak ke paas he
 According to the formula, Virbhadra Singh is the biggest face of the Congress in Himachal and he will be the electoral face of the Congress party, Virbhadra Singh will distribute more and more tickets according to his mind, which Shinde has given to Virbhadra at the signal of high command
 jaldi 28 taarikh ko himachal main hone vaale kaarykram main pradesh adhyaksh sukkhu or mukhyamantri virbhadra singh ek saath manch par honge, jisase yah congress sandesh degi ki, sab kuch thik chal rahaa he yani virbhadra kii baat maani to ja rahi he, lekin sharton ke saath nahin
 That means face Virbhadra in the election, his importance in ticket distribution, but it is better not to remove Sukhu a month and a half before the election
 sutron ke mutabik, jaldi hi sab kuch tay hone ke baad prabharee scindia virbhadra singh or sukkhu ke bich samjhaute ko antim rup de denge or uske baad donon ke saath sonia rahul se mulaakaat kar lenge
 With this, the party is hopeful that the battle of Himachal Congress will reach the peace phase
 congress kii koshish he ki, ladaai is baar congress banaam congress nahin, congress banaam bijepi ho
 In this entire politics, the leaders of Himachal Congress who meddle in national politics have also convinced Shinde
 unako bhi darjanabhar tikaton kaa vaayada kar diya gaya he, wo netaa hai virbhadra se 36 kaa aankada rakhane vaale anand sharma, jinako sukkhu kii takat mana jaataa he
 Overall, by giving power like Punjab's Amarinder, the party is ready to give strength to Virbhadra in Himachal, but the high command does not succumb to pressure, so there is no question of removing Sukhu
 jo bhi ho, party ke sanghathan ke bheetar ke halaat bhale party sanbhaalane kaa daawa kare, lekin safalataa to himachal kii janata ke jazbaat ko saath rakhane par hi hogi

 Why did you do it? So Abina's wife Amina Bano said, "why would we have kept it, we have not been taught to keep it
 eemaandaaree kii to roti or chatnee hi bahut he hamaare liye
 We want to give back the money
 " Jaipur Police Commissioner Janga Srinivas Ro was shocked to see Abid returning the money
 bhrashtachar kii is duniya main aise log to unke saamne kam hi aate honge
 He said "this is very good
 yah aadmi ek rickshaw chalata he, thela chalata he or is tarah ke aadmi ke haath agar ek lakh rupee lagen or vah eemaandaaree se police ke supurd kar de to yah qaabile tarif he
 " aabid or ameena kii kai jaruratein ek lakh rupee se puri ho sakati thim
 Children's education, daughter's wedding expenses, etc
 lekin is eemaandaar shaks ko aisa ek paisa bhi manjuur nahin hua, jis par uskaa haq na ho
 Abid Qureshi reached the police commissioner's office
 usne vahaan kahai ki "shaam 4 baje mujhe yah paisa mila raste main mila
 We sat till ten o'clock in the night that someone would come, but if no one came, i went home
 ab main yahaan dene aayaa hoon yah paise
 How do we keep it, we have to give it back
 " Abid remained sitting till 10 in the night at the Chaura Rasta market in Jaipur, where he received money
 usne sochaa ki shaayad jisane paise giraae hai vah vahaan dhundta hua aa jayega
 When he reached home at night, his wife Amina also said that return the money
 tippaniyan When the reporters questioned the said couple, if you kept the money, nobody would even know
 aapane aisa kyon kiya? to aabid kii patni ameena bano ne kaha "kyon rakh lete, hamen to aisa sikhaaya hi nahin he ki ham rakh len
 Bread of honesty and chutney is enough for us
 ham paise waapas dena chaahate hai
 " jaipur ke police kamishnar janga shrinivas ro bhi aabid ko paise lautaate dekhakar hairat main pad gaye
 In this world of corruption, such people would rarely come before them
 unhone kaha "yah bahut acha he
 This man walks a rickshaw, a jam, and if such a man incurs a lakh rupees and hands it over to the police, it is a commendable compliment
 " Abid and Ameena's many needs could be met with one lakh rupees
 bacchon kii padhai , beti kii shaadi kaa kharch vagairah
 But this honest man did not even approve a single penny, which he does not deserve
 aabid raat main 10 baje tak vahiin jaipur ke chaura rasta bazaar main baitha rahaa, jahaan use paise mili the
 He thought that maybe the one who dropped the money would come looking for him there
 vah raat main jab ghar pahunchaa to uski bivi ameena kaa bhi yahi kahana tha ki paise lautaa do

 eggzet pole par ab aisi koi baat nahin he jo kahi ja sakati he
 The problem in TV is that when the whole thing has been said, then how to tell it again
 darasal yahi tivi he
 After the exit poll, all the channels should disappear by midnight of the 22nd, just as Namo TV has disappeared on its own after the exit poll started
 bina ajna ke aane vaala or bagair kisi aadesh ke chale janaa aisa aagyaakaari channel hamane nahin dekha
 Namo is coming, so what is the work of Namo TV now
 namo tivi kaa kaam ho gaya he
 There is a lot of fun going on the exit poll on Twitter
 sarkari or virdohi paksh twitor par mande ko bhi sande manaa rahe hai
 Very funny joking is going on
 yah acha he
 Before the exit poll, check the voting percentage by visiting the Election Commission website
 vahaan bhi kai choti choti kahaniyaan hai
 All the ten Reserve seats of Madhya Pradesh were polled in 2019 more than the 2014 elections
 bani bedi kii research bataati he ki madhya pradesh kii anusuchit janajati or jati ke liye reserve das siton par mat pratishat ausatan das pratishat se adhik rahaa he
 That is, this time 10 percent more votes than in 2014
 bani ne ye data madhya pradesh ke mukhya nirvachan adhikari kii website se liya he

 The last election meeting of Narendra Modi was held in Khargone itself
 iske alaava unhone ratlam main sabha kii jahaan 12 pratishat vot adhik padaa he 2014 se
 Have held a meeting in Dhar also
 rahul gandhi ne madhya pradesh kii 8 reserve siton par sabha kii he
 Could not go only in two
 khargaun main bhi rahul gandhi ne sabha kii he
 Amit Shah has also held some of these seats
 yah sab reserve siten hai
 Was there a Modi wave in these seats? aakhir das pratishat adhik matdaan hua he, iske peeche kuch to kaaran rahaa hoga
 The polling percentage in ten reserve seats of not one, but ten, has increased by 10 percent compared to 2014
 madhya pradesh main 2019 main gair arakshit siti par ausat matdaan 70
 It is 01 percent
 2019 main madhya pradesh kii reserve siton par ausat matdaan 73
 45 percent
 reserve siton par gair reserve siton kii tulana main 3 pratishat se adhik matdaan hua he
 8 compared to 2014 on the non-reserved seats here
 65 pratishat adhik matdaan hua he
 11 this time compared to 2014 on reserve seats
 15 pratishat matdaan adhik hua he
 Are these the areas where people are seeing the impact of the benefits from the government schemes or here the Congress has done some hard work
 lekin bihar or upi kii reserve siton par bhi adhik matdaan kyon hua he
 In 2014, BJP won all the Reserve seats of UP
 upi kii 17 rigerv siton par matdaan kaa jo ausat he vah puure pradesh ke ausat matdaan ke aas-paas hi he
 The average voting percentage for the Reserve seats in 2019 is 58
 39 pratishat he
 The average turnout in these reserve seats in 2014 was 56
 96 pratishat
 1 here compared to 2014

 There are 84 seats reserved for Scheduled Castes across the country and 47 seats for Scheduled Tribes
 donon kaa yoga hota he 131 siten
 Maharashtra has 5 reserve seats
 inamen se chaar anusuchit jati he or ek janajati he
 Here the average turnout is same as in 2014
 lekin bihar main pradesh ke ausat matdaan se rigerv siton par matdaan zyaada rahaa he
 Bihar has six reserve seats
 susheel mahapatra ne bihar kaa data dekha to pataa laga ki hajipur main 2019 main 57
 72 percent of the vote was cast
 2014 main yahaan 54
 Was 91 percent

 It was 72 percent of the vote
 samastipur main 2019 main 60
 80 per cent of the vote, while 57 in 2014
 38 pratishat vot padaa tha
 There is a different trend on the Reserve seats of UP and Maharashtra, either less or same as last time, but the voting trend in the Reserve seats of Bihar and Madhya Pradesh is quite different
 pehle se kaaphi zyada he
 The same trend has been observed in Jharkhand
 aise dekhie ki gramin kshetron main is baar matdaan kaa pratishat shaharon se kaaphi acha he
 In urban areas, the percentage of voting has decreased by 2 percent and in a metropolis like Delhi it has decreased by 5 percent
 vaise is baar azaadi ke baad sabase adhik matdaan hua he
 66
 44 pratishat
 These additions are yet to be added
 chunaav ayog kaa data kahata he ki 2014 main 66
 The turnout was 44 percent
 is baar mahila matadaataaon ne zyada vot kiya he or purushon ke matdaan se apana antar kaaphi kam kar liya he
 Polling in urban areas has come down
 pehle charan main 87 shahari seat the jinamein se 55 par bijepi ne jeet hasil kii thi
 Polling in more than half of the urban seats has been low this time
 ab aate hai upi ke eggzet pole main
 Here BJP is predicted to get 30 to 68 seats in different surveys
 news eks netaa ne bijepi ko 33 siten di hai
 BJP has got 33 seats in the exit poll of ABP News Nelson
 website anthro
 ai has given BJP seats in the range of 31-30
 news 24 chanakya ne bijepi ko 65 siten di hai
 Aaj Tak Axis My India has given 62-68 seats
 7 eggzet pole main mahagathbandhan or congress ko bijepi se kam siten mili hai
 antro
 ai ne mahagathbandhan ko 46-54 siten mili hai
 Chanakya has given 13 seats to the lowest till date
 itnaa antar kyon hota he
 Is it not necessary to understand it separately? yah kaise ho saktaa he ki badi tasviir ek hi hogi lekin alag alag rajyon main alag alag trend he
 Why exit polls are presenting a different picture at the state level
 upi main ek pole kahata he ki bijepi ko 15-20 siten aaengi, ek pole kahata he ki mahagathbandhan ko 38-40 siten aaengi or teesraa pole kahata he ki bijepi ko 65 se adhik siten aati hai
 Why do three poll results make such a difference? yah to sambhaavnaaon kaa khel ho gaya
 But this difference should not be different
 agar sabakaa data sahi he
 Is there a problem with the data
 yaa to thik se eggzet pole nahin hua yaa baad main data ko badla gaya he
 Results of different surveys in Kerala, Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Odisha confound such a picture
 lekin bijepi kaa maananaa he ki yuvaaon ne jati se upar uthakar bijepi ko vot kiya he
 There is a consensus among all the scholars that the number of seats may go back and forth but the trend is towards the formation of Narendra Modi's government
 bijepi ke netaa eggzet pole ko lekar utsahit ho gaye hai
 The Leader of the Opposition is still rejecting the exit poll
 ensipi netaa sharad pavaar ne kaha he ki eggzet pole ke baad logon main bechaini bad gai he
 The exit poll is just a gimmick
 maharashtra main agsit pole main bijepi shivasena ko 38-42 siten mili hai exis maai india aaj tak ke survey main
 Republic TV Sea Voters and several exit polls have given a figure of 34
 maharashtra ke 48 siton par bijepi shivasena hi aage nazar aa rahi he
 The Trinamool Congress has written to the Election Commission that the broadcast of Prime Minister Modi's Kedarnath yatra is a violation of the code of conduct
 channelon ne ise kaise prasaarit kiya
 The statements of BJP and opposition leaders on the exit poll are different
 bijepi kaa kahana he ki mahagathbandhan jaisaa prayog fail ho chukaa he
 After the exit poll, how did the stock market soar
 agar vahaan paisa banane kaa khel chal rahaa he to aap bhi udhar dhyaan den
 Exit polls also revealed that they are busy there
 aaj aakhir sesanks or nifti itnaa kyon uchhal gaya
 The record of bounce became the same
 sesanks 1422 ank uchhal kar 39353 par band hua
 The Nifty jumped 421 points to close at 11,828
 18 may 2009 ke baad se yah sabase adhik oochaal he
 5 lakh crore capital was added to Sensex and 43 thousand crore capital was added to Nifty
 bazaar ke export kah rahe hai ki endie kii vaapasi ke kaaran oochaal aayaa he
 Shares of Adani's company jumped 17 percent and SBI, Tata Motors and Yes Bank also rose 7 percent
 udhar raajnneetik dal ke netaa yahaan se vahaan jane lage hai
 Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu is quite active even before the end of polling
 eggzet pols saamne aane ke agle din unhone kolkata main bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee se mulaaqaat kii
 Naidu did not say anything after the meeting but before that he had told reporters that politics would be discussed in the meeting
 unhone ye bhi bataaya ki hamane chunaav ayog se milane ke liye mamata se dilli aane kaa aagrah kiya he
 Opposition parties are going to meet the Election Commission in Delhi on Tuesday to express their concerns about evms
 vipaksh kii maang rahi he ki kam se kam 50% vivipat slips kii counting kii jaae lekin ye maang supreme court khaarij kar chukaa he
 Instead, the Supreme Court has ordered that VVPAT slips should be counted at five evms instead of one EVM per assembly constituency
 ab vipaksh kaa kahana he ki agar kisi loksabhaa kshetra ke tahat aane vaale vidhansabha kshetra main koi gadabad pai jaati he to vahaan kii sabhi vivipat slips kii ginati kii jaae
 Earlier, Chandrababu Naidu met UPA Chairperson Sonia Gandhi and NCP President Sharad Pawar on Sunday
 shanivaar ko unhone lakhanu main samaajawaadee party adhyaksh akhilesh yadav or basapa adhyaksh mayawati se mulaaqaat kii
 Meanwhile, in Lucknow, Samajwadi Party President Akhilesh Yadav met his coalition partner Mayawati and discussed the situation arising after the results
 baithak ke baad akhilesh yadav ne kaha ki main apane rukh par qaayam hum
 The Grand Alliance is winning 56 seats in UP and now we will talk after the results on 23 May
 iskaa ek matlab ye he ki donon partiyaan nateezon ke din upie cheirperson sonia gandhi kii bulaai baithak se baahar rahane kii yojana bana chuki hai
 It is also being said that Mayawati does not have plans to meet Congress President Rahul Gandhi till the results are clear

 pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa 500 or 1,000 rupee ke note band karne kaa 'bada faisla' mahaj 'kharaab pakshpatpurna shadyantr' yaa 'mahangaa raajnneetik majaak' banakar rah jayega, agar vah iske bade-bade vaadon ko puraa karne main asafal rahe
 This comment was made by China's official media
 sarkari global times ne ek lekh main likhaa he, 'aisa baari-bharkam or vistrut abhiyaan chalaane ke liye raajnneetik saahas kii jarurat hoti he, lekin ise khushnuma ant tak pahunchane main bahut buddhi kii jarurat padati he
 'he has written,' Given the fact that people are paying a huge price for a possible change, a multi-acclaimed masterstroke or major reform for Modi if the BJP failed to deliver on its big promises
 It will simply be a 'poorly biased conspiracy' or a 'costly political joke'
 ' The article said that the discontinuation of the old big currency notes is not new in India
 haalanki bharat main baari maatra main maujuud kalaadhan ko khatm karnaa kabhi bhi aasaan mishan nahin rahaa
 According to the newspaper, "if Modi fails to support this stormy reform with sustainable and fundamental steps, the benefits of the huge social and economic value that the people of India have paid so far will end immediately
" ' lekh ke anusaar, puraane bade noton kaa chalan band hone se bhaajapa ko bhi laabh ho saktaa he
 The comments usamen kaha gaya he, 'modi ke is kadam ke peeche yadhyapi nihit pakshpatpurna agenda bhi he
 
 
 The instant circulation of currency notes can harm other political parties, which had more money than their own BJP
 isse aagaamee uttar pradesh tathaa punjab vidhansabha chunaavon main bhaajapa ko kaaphi laabh hoga
 (apart from the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it has been published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) Government Global Times has written in an article, "it takes political courage to run such a huge and elaborate campaign, but it takes a lot of wisdom to bring it to a happy end
 ' usne likhaa he, 'is tathy ko dekhte hue ki logon ko sambhavit badlaav ke liye bahut badi keemat chukaani pad rahi he, agar bijepi apane bade-bade vaadon ko puraa karne main asafal rahi to modi ke liye bahu-prashansit masterstroke yaa bada sudhaar mahaj ek 'kharaab pakshpatpurna shadyantr' yaa 'mahangaa raajnneetik majaak' banakar rah jayega
 ' lekh main kaha gaya he ki puraane bade noton kaa chalan band kiya janaa bharat main nai baat nahin he
 However, eliminating the huge amount of black money in India has never been an easy mission
 akhbaar ke anusaar, 'is tufaani sudhaar kaa chirsthayee or moolbhoot kadamon se samarthan karne main agar modi asafal rahe to bharat ke logon ne abhi tak jo behad bada saamaajik or aarthik mulya chukaaya he, uske baavjood isse hua laabh turant khatm ho jayega
 According to the article, the BJP may also benefit from the discontinuation of the old big currency notes
 tippaniyan It states, 'there is a vested partisan agenda, though behind Modi's move

 35 saal kii manisha duusari baar saroget madar banane ja rahi hai
 This time for an Indian couple, while for the first time they gave birth to a surrogate child for a foreign couple
 pehali baar kokh kiraaye par dene par unhen 6 lakh rupee mili the
 If everything goes well this time, you will get a good amount
 manisha ke paanch bachche hai or pati ahmedabad main ek showrooms main naukari karte hai
 She feels that by becoming a surrogate mother, she will help her family immensely
 aaj ke samay main jahaan ghar chalanaa hi mushkil he vahiin in paison se vah ek ghar kii malkin ban gai hai
 She has bought a house for the first time from the money she got when she became a surrogate mother and took some loan, which if she will get the money for the second time, she has made up her mind to repay the loan
 inke jaisi hi 33 saal kii mahila hai minaa
 Meena's husband works in a small factory in Anand
 tankhwaah bahut hi maamuli he aise main do bacchon kii parvarish bhi bada boj ban sakati he
 That is why Meena is going to be a surrogate mother for the first time
 in sabhi main nae bill ko lekar naaraazgi he, kyonki ye yaa inke jaisi mahilaayein saroget madar nahin ban paaengi
 It is important that Anand has become a hub of surrogate mothers in the country
 agle kuch maheenon main kareeb 50 saroget madar akele aanand se hi hai
 According to the new bill, foreign couples will not be able to have children through a surrogate mother in India
 saath hi koi bhi mahila ek se zyada baar saroget madar nahin ban paaengi

 Not caring about Islamabad's objections to the recent statement made by British Prime Minister David Cameron regarding Pakistan, Britain said that Cameron is firm on his statement and will neither back down nor apologize

 On the eve of Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari's visit to Britain, a Cameron spokeswoman said, "he stands by his statement

 Prime Minister's office sources said that Cameron would try to reduce the outrage generated in Pakistan by his statement but would not apologize for his statement regarding the "dual move of elements of Pakistan in relation to terrorism"
 camran ne bangalore main kaha tha, ‘‘ham is vichaar ko katai bardaasht nahin kar sakate ki is desh (pakistan) ko bharat ho yaa afghanistan yaa vishwa ke kisi bhi desh main aatankwaad ke niryaat ko protsaahit karne ke sambandh main dohari chaal chalane kii chhot di jaae

 ek aadhikarik bayaan main kaha gaya he, ‘‘baithak ke dauraan kuraishi ne british pradhanmantri dwaara bharat main haal main pakistan sambandhi diye gayi bayaan par sarkaar tathaa janata kii bhaavana se avgat karaayaa
 Qureshi said that terrorism is a global issue and all countries should deal with it with a spirit of cooperation

 The father of a girl victim of autism related to this has challenged in the High Court about this attitude of hospitals
 darasal otism kii shikaar 28 saal kii aakanksha jab november 2015 main dengue kii shikaar hui to uske pita ne use dilli ke behad namchin bade aspataal main ilaaj ke liye bhartee karaayaa lekin aspataal ne dengue se peedit aakanksha kaa ilaaj yah kahkar karne se manaa kar diya ki uske paas maansik rogiyon ke upachaar ke liye license nahin he
 This was a major setback for Akanksha's father Sanjay Tiwari
 unhone sochaa nahin tha ki koi aspataal unki beti ke ilaaj ke liye bhedbhaav ke aadhaar par manaa kar saktaa he
 On one hand the daughter's life was at risk and on the other hand the hospital was refusing treatment
 sanjay tiwari ne haar nahin maani
 After this attitude of the hospital, Sanjay Tiwari had to face many difficulties in getting treatment even after going to the place
 lihaaja sanjay ne tay kiya ki jo bhi unke saath aspataal main hua vah baaki or kisi maansik rogi ke saath nahin hona chahie
 He filed a PIL in the Delhi High Court
 is yachika ke daalane ke baad court kii taraf se sarkaar ko notice hua or sarkaar ne apane halafname main saaf kar diya ki koi bhi aspataal kisi bhi marij ke ilaaj ke liye manaa nahin kar saktaa
 Not only this, after the notice received from the Medical Council of India, the doctor also apologized for not treating Akanksha
 is yachika main kuch or chijen bhi sanjay tiwari kii taraf se maangi gai hai
 It also includes giving special training to doctors and nurses providing treatment to mental patients in every hospital
 kai baar aspataal maansik rogiyon ko hone vaali saadhaaran bimariyon kaa ilaaj karne se isliye bhi bachate hai kyonki unako pataa hi nahin hota ki marij ko upachaar dete vakt kin chizon kaa dhyaan rakhana chahie
 The court is soon to pronounce its verdict in this case, which will clarify what action can be taken against a hospital if it refuses to give treatment to mental patients for the treatment of common ailments
 sanjay tiwari ke vakil vivek narayan sharma kehete he ki hindustan main maansik rogiyon ko saadhaaran bimariyon ke liye ilaaj ko lekar aspataalon ko koi khaas disha-nirdesh nahin die gaye hai or isi kaa phayda uthaakar aksar aspataal aise rogiyon ko bina ilaaj ke hi waapas bhej dete hai
 In February, the Delhi High Court can pronounce its verdict in the matter which may be a relief for mental patients and their families

 In a way, Antony has been a follower of Pilate throughout his career and has lost many things

 The political stir in Kolkata since Sunday night is over by Tuesday, but its meaning is being removed far and wide
 aisa pehali baar hua he ki apane kisi adhikari ko sibiai se bachaane ke liye koi mukhyamantri dharne par baitha ho
 All this happened so fast in West Bengal that there was no scope of guessing
 ab supreme court ke faisle ko donon apni-apni jeet bataa rahe hai
 The court has said that Kolkata Police Commissioner Rajeev Kumar may be questioned by the CBI in Shillong in the Saradha chit fund case
 lekin unhen giraftaar nahin kiya ja saktaa
 On the other hand, Rajiv Kumar is also ordered by the court to appear before the CBI
 mamata banerjee ne ise apni jeet bataate hue dharna khatm kar diya he, lekin yah sawaal uthanaa laazmi he ki isse tiemasi or bijepi ko mila kya?philhal pashchim bengal main bijepi ke paas khone ke liye kuch nahin tha
 Seeing the way the BJP was pressurizing Mamata, Mamata was looking for an opportunity and found it on Sunday
 udhar, bijepi ke paas aise tamaam tark aa gaye ki mamata bhrashtachar ko badhaava de rahi hai or ek afasar ko bachaane ke liye aakhir kyon aage aa rahi hai?vipaksh kaa cheharaa ban gayi mamtapure raajnneetik ghatnakram ko agar taatkaalik rup se dekha jaae to is mudde ne mamata banerjee ko ekaek vipaksh kaa cheharaa bana diya he
 He took such a step in shock that many parties gathered to support him or he had to give moral support
 sapa pramukh se lekar congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi, argedy netaa tejasvi yadav sahit vipaksh ke taamam netaaon ne mamata ko saath dene kii ghoshnaa kii or kuch netaa to kolkata pahunch gaye
 After the decision of the Supreme Court, Chandrababu Naidu ended his picket
 vahiin se elaan kiya gaya ki ab agali ladaai dilli main ladi jaaegi
 It is natural that Mamta Banerjee will be at the center of it
 sapa-basapa gathbandhan hone ke saath hi mayawati kaa graph ekaek bad gaya tha
 Chandrababu Naidu's graph also rose when he was uniting all opposition parties
 mamata kii raily main kejariwal to mehfil hi lut le gaye the
 But today the situation has changed and Mamta is once again in the race from the opposition
 kaaryakartaaon main josh bhar diyabijepi jis tarah se bengal main trinmul congress par dabaav bana rahi thi usase mamata ke saamne sankat khadaa ho gaya tha
 He did not give permission for Amit Shah's helicopter to land
 bijepi kii rathyatra rokane ke liye vah court se bhi nahin darin or apana paksh majbootee se rakhaa
 This led to a message that Mamata is scared of BJP
 kaaryakartaaon main bhi galat sandesh ja rahaa tha
 But in a jolt he turned the dice
 sibiai ke ection ke baad tiemasi ke kaaryakarta sadakon par utre, unhone trainen rokin
 Shouted slogans and in a way the entire cadre came on the streets
 kisi netaa ke liye yah sabase badi baat hoti he ki uske ek ishaare par uske kaaryakarta sadakon par utar aaen or netaa ke aadesh par kuch bhi karne ko taiyaar rahen
 Mamta has been targeting the central government and BJP, but putting the ruling party workers on the streets is considered a great achievement
 bijepi kaa muqabla vahi kar sakati hanmamta yah sandesh dene main safal raheen kii bijepi kaa muqabla vahi kah sakati hai
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi supported her but her MP and former West Bengal Congress President Adhir Ranjan Chaudhary criticized Mamata
 unhone kaha ki mamata bhrashtachar ko badhaava de rahi hai
 The condition of CPM had become such that it was not in a position to say anything
 vah mamata kaa samarthan nahin kar sakati thi or na hi sibiai kaa samarthan kar sakati thi
 In such a situation, when the whole country was watching an incident from the point of view of a party, not expressing any reaction of one party shows its dilemma
 mamata ne apane kadam se bataa diya he ki vahi hai jo bijepi kaa muqabla kar sakati hai
 He was the only one who fought the CPM
 isiilie shaayad unhone dharne ke liye vahi sthaan metro channel kaa chunaav kiya jahaan unhone sipiem ke khilaaf lanbaa dharna diya tha or tata ko singoor se vidaa karke maani thim
 Apart from this, the fort of the Left was also captured by power
 bijepi ko kya miladansal bengal main bijepi ke paas khone ke liye kuch nahin tha
 BJP got 2 seats in West Bengal in 2014
 ab bhale hi usne 22 siton kaa target bana liya ho lekin party kaa maananaa he ki mamata ko benakaab karne main safal rahi
 The biggest thing Mamata decided with her speeches and reaction was that Trinamool will now face BJP in West Bengal
 yah ek aisi party ke liye badi baat ho gai jiske do saansad hon or vah apni sarkaar banane kaa sapana dekh rahi ho
 Rajiv Kumar's inquiry was called a victory by BJP
 Ravi Shankar Prasad said in a press conference that Rajiv Kumar knows what secret Raja wants to save him
 smriti irani ne bhi un par sawaal khadey kiye
 The BJP managed to surround Mamata by sending a message to her cadres that Mamata could go to any extent to oppose the BJP
 isliye or majboot hone kii jarurat he
 First, he did not allow Amit Shah's helicopter to land
 phir yogi kaa helicopter nahin utarane diya lekin jab upi ke siem yogi adityanath sadak maarg se purulia main raily karne pahunche to pashchim bengal sarkaar ko parmishan deni padi
 Now the process of the tour of BJP leaders is about to begin, Shivraj is going to rally in Kharagpur on Wednesday
 amit shah or modi kii kai reliyaan ho chuki hai
 In the days to come, this war of words will intensify and the land of West Bengal will once again be witness to fierce politics
