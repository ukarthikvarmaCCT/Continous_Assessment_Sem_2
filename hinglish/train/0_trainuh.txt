 Former cricketer VVS Laxman on Tuesday called Mahendra Singh Dhoni a 'match winner' and said that this wicket-keeper batsman could still play Test cricket for two-three years more
 dhoni ke lambii avadhi ke praaroop se sanyas lene par tippanee karte hue lakshmana ne 'enditivi' se kaha, 'vah ab bhi van-de captain he or bharat ko vishwa-cap main unki jarurat padegi jahaan bhartiya team khitaab kaa bachaav karne ke liye khelegi
 But, my personal opinion is that he could have played two to three more years now as India have to play a lot of Tests on the domestic side next year and he could again take India to the top
 ' He said, 'the world will remember him as the captain who captained him with complete dominance
 vah balle se match vijeta he or wicketcaping kii unki khaas style he
 He always wanted to make sure that the dressing room had a good atmosphere
 ' Former Indian captain Sunil Gavaskar said that Dhoni's contribution cannot be said in words
 unhone kaha, 'unhone bhartiya cricket ke liye jo hasil kiya vah bemisaal he
 His contribution cannot be stated in words
 ' BJP president Amit Shah held a road show from Allahabad's Allahabad to Berena and Sulakhi Chouraha to Ghantaghar to create an atmosphere in favor of BJP before the fourth phase of voting in Allahabad (february 23)
 do din pehle pradhanmantri narendra modi ne bhi elahabaad or aasapaas ke jilo main apane or sahyogi dalon ke 32 ummidavaaron ke samarthan liye raily kii thi lekin ab sawaal yah he ki piem narendra modi kii raily ke baad chunaav prachaar ke antim dinbijepi adhyakshmit shah ko road sho kyon karnaa padaa
 There is a reason for this that Allahabad district consists of Pratapgarh, Jaunpur, Bhadohi, Kaushambi, Mirzapur, Sonbhadra, Banda, Chitrakoot districts
 aise main bijepi kisi bhi tarah kaa risk lene ke mood main nahin he kyunki aaj hi akhilesh yadav or rahul gandhi kaa bhi road sho tay tha
 Road Show in a hurrybjp President Amit Shah also kept his road show in a hurry so that the threat of PM Modi's rally was not weakened
 kahi usapar akhilesh yadav or rahul gandhi kaa road shopiem modike banaae hue maahaul ko antim samay par kharaab naa kar de
 The BJP also fears that if the party's grip in Allahabad weakens, then the atmosphere of the party will continue to deteriorate in the next phases
 ye hi kaaran he piem modi or amit shah chota sa bhi risk nahin lenaa chaahate

 Luka Chuppi Review: Bollywood has shifted its gears over the past few years, and 'luka Chuppi' by Karthik Aaryan and Kriti Sanon is the film in this episode
 chote shahar kii jindagi, roodhiyaan or pareshaaniyaan tathaa khushiyaan sab kuch 'luka chuphi (luka Chuppi)' apane main samete he
 Along with this, the acting of the entire team of the film also matters a lot, and 'luka Chuppi' does not disappoint on all these criteria and does not leave any money to entertain the audience
 acting ke morche par karthik aryan har film ke saath nikharate ja rahe hai
 'luka Chuppi' represents only the opening windows in small-town Bollywood
 'luka chuphi' main sabhi kalakaaron ne bahut hi behtareen andaaj se kaam kiya he
 The story of 'luka Chuppi' is from Guddu (karthik Aryan) of Mathura who falls in love with Rashmi (kriti Senan)
 guddu tehre chote shahar ke yuva, ishk hua to shaadi kii baat karte hai lekin khule mizaaj vaali rashmi shaadi se pehle rishte ko aajamaane ke liye liv-in kii baat karti hai to donon kii jindagi main twist aa jaataa he
 Rashmi's father is a leader and he is also a strong opponent of live-in
 guddu or rashmi pati-patni banakar rahane lagate hai
 But one day the householders get a glimpse of it, and then the great Indian family drama begins
 is tarah film kii kahani main chote shahar kii maansikta or vahaan kii jindagi kii gahari se padtaal he
 But the story is a bit drawn
 film main kalakaaron kii acting or hansi kaa put film ko bor nahin hone detaa he
 All the actors of 'luka Chuppi' have lived up to the acting front
 karthik aryan ne guddu ke kirdaar ko bakhubi nibhaayaa he or shaadi kaa unka utavlaapan bahut hi mjedaar lagata he
 At the same time, Kriti Sanon, who was seen in 'bareilly Ki Barfi', has also played the character of a flawless girl very brilliantly
 vinay pathak kaa kadak andaaj bhi dil main utar jaataa he, or pankaj treepathi ko dekhnaa ek baar phir dilachasp rahaa he
 But in Abbas's character, Aparkashati Khurana gets caught sight and wants to see him a bit more in the film
 aparshakti film-dar-film apni majboot maujuudagi darj kara rahe hai
 Talking of direction in 'luka Chuppi', Laxman Utekar has done a good job but by keeping the film a bit tight and the story a bit more he could make it a great film
 film kaa mujeec nayaa nahin he kyonki saare hi song puraane hai or unhen ricreat kiya gaya he
 In this way, the film offers nothing new in terms of music
 lekin isamen koi shaq nahin ki saare gane hi superhit rah chuke hai
 Then the Moral Policing issue is also featured in the film
 is tarah 'luka chuphi' chote shahar kii aatma apane samete hue van time watch antertainer he

 In the National Herald case, the Delhi High Court has reserved the judgment on the petition of Rahul Gandhi, Sonia Gandhi and Oscar Fernandes challenging the notice related to tax assessment of Income Tax Department

 In fact, Rahul and Sonia Gandhi have filed a petition challenging the Income Tax Department's notice asking them to re-examine the tax assessment of National Herald and Young India

 The market value of the share is also checked

 Tushar Mehtane said that the information related to income from the preliminary inquiry was more
 tushaar mehta ne kaha ki aap jo share kharidte hai wo us samay ke market vailu se dekhen to inakam ke bare main jaankaree milti he
 There is also a rule in this company that whenever a share is sold or transferred, the audit is done according to the market
 vahiin, 100 rupee prati share khride gaye share kii keemat zyada thi
 He further said that the interest in the property belongs to Young India Company
 90 karod yang india ne ekwaire kiya tha, or aisa lagata he ki yang india company ne ageel ko tech over keval property hasil karne ke liye kiya
 After this, Young India started working in real estate which AJL used to do
 justise es rabindra bhatta netushar mehtaase poocha ki kya aap kahana chaahate hai ki jab share alot kiya gaya us vakt share kii market vailu zyada thi
 To this Tushar Mehta replied that of course, this is what we are saying
 jabaki sonia gandhi ke liye vakil ke taur par pesh hue pi chidambaram ne kaha ki 26 farvari 2012 ko yang india ne yachikakarta (sonia rahul) ko share diya
 What does AJL do, who gives the check, what does my client have to do with it? But Tushar Mehta, appearing on behalf of the Income Tax Department, said that we mean the most

 In such a situation, the courage of the great surmises is shaken

 He said that he is 50 years old and had never faced such a situation
 vah waapas ghar janaa chahta tha, lekin hamane use kisi tarah samajhaayaa
 Arrived at the uplinking spot and Sublink did some uplink

 The wireless network of the police cannot even shed tears at the powerlessness of its officers because it works many times and not many times

 Wind speed became almost normal
 barish ruk gai

 If this happens then India will have to pay for this confrontation

 akhbaar ne likhaa he kibharat kii is tarah kii karrwichin kii samprabhutaa ko chunauti he, jis tarah se lagaataar tanaav bad rahaa he
 China should be fully prepared for confrontation, although it should also use prudence

 ' Narendra Modi may have breathed peace on May 24 as his most staunch rival Sanjay Joshi resigned from the bjp's national executive on that day
 joshi ke dobaaraa pravesh par maheenon maathapai chali thi, uske baad modi unhen party se baahar nikalwane par ad gaye the
 But when his bet did not work and the Sangh decided to re-appoint Nitin Gadkari as president, Modi also threw the last dice
 sutron ke mutabik, modi ne joshi ko nahin hataane par kaaryakarini or rashtriya parishad se istife kii dhamkee de di
 The forced to break the deadlock was cut midway after the party core group meeting and consultations with the union
 is prakriya main sangh ke sah sarkarywah suresh soni ne ahm bhoomika nibhaai or gadakari ne khud joshi se baatcheet kii, jiske baad rashtriya kaaryakarini main modi kaa aana sunishchit hua
 Modi had also objected to the Constitution amendment giving Gadkari a second term, but he agreed to the amendment in lieu of Joshi's resignation
 yah ghatana gadakari samet sangh ke bheetar modi virdohi dhade ke liye bada jhtka he, jisane gujarat ke mukhyamantri kii daleelon ko thukraayaa or pichley saal agast main joshi ko party main laakar uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaav kii kaman saunp di thi
 The episode created a ruckus in the relationship between Gadkari and Modi, and it came to such a point that formal communication between the two leaders had also stopped
 joshi ne party adhyaksh gadakari ko bheje istife main us dard ko udelte hue likhaa he, ''main sanghathan kaa anushaasit sipaahi hum, jisane sadaiv vyaktigat hit se upar uth satya nishtha or dhyey nishtha rakhana siikhaa he
 In the same tradition, i offer my resignation from the invited membership of the National Executive in order to ensure smooth and smooth functioning in the organization and to end the deadlock
 ''joshi 2005 main ek sex sidi ke chalate party se baahar kar die gaye the
 The CD was revealed during the party session in Mumbai and this time too Mumbai did not prove lucky for them
 haalanki party ke ek varisht netaa kehete hai, ''joshi kaa istipha asthaayee taur par hi sangharsh viraam kaa kaam karegaa kyonki unhone sirf rashtriya kaaryakarini se istipha diya he, party se nahin tathaa sangh parivaar ke bheetar modi virdohi dhada unhen party se puri tarah nikaale jane kaa virodh kar saktaa he
 "the sangh-bjp have also bowed down to Modi seeing the opportunity
 sangh ke ek varisht netaa kehete hai, ''gujarat chunaav main haar sangh kii vichaardhaara kii haar hogi
 Therefore, at the moment, even without wanting to take a harsh decision
 ''joshi kii bhaajapa main vaapasi par modi ne talwaar nikaal lee thi
 Strategically, he first lodged a complaint with a lower Sangh official to senior leaders of the Sangh and then stopped picking up calls from Gadkari and his supporters
 joshi ke masale par gadakari or modi ke bich pehali daraar tab dikhi jab gadakari, modi ke sadbhaavna kaarykram main sitambar main ahmedabad nahin pahunche
 At that event, almost the entire leadership of the BJP reached the capital of Gujarat and NDA leaders also came
 gadakari us vakt mumbai main apana vajan kam karne vaali surgery kii baat karke usamen shaamil nahin hue
 After this, Modi also retaliated
 unhone navaratri ke upwas ko aktubar main bhaajapa kii rashtriya kaaryakarini main jane se inkaar kaa bahaanaa banaaya tha
 But according to a senior leader of the state BJP who knows Modi, "modi plays for his big share and keeps his base strong because he knows that the results will be good in the long run
" joshi vaale prakaran main is ranneeti ne kaam kiya he
 However, the story of how Modi strengthened his anti-joshi side is very interesting
 ek madhyasth ke jariye modi ne pehle sangh or phir bhaajapa netritv tak yah kadaa sandesh pahunchaaya ki na sirf joshi kii sex sidi sahi he balki ve achche se jaanate hai ki kaise kuch varisht party netaa joshi ko bachaane ke liye forensik laboratory se 'farji praaanpatr' jugad laae, jisamen sidi ko nakli bataaya gaya
 His moderator allegedly questioned the Sangh and BJP leaders on behalf of Modi: "if Modi had been caught in any such CD scandal, would you have spared him?" Shouldn't the Sangh and BJP leadership use the same criteria for everyone in the Sangh Parivar? "the Sangh and bjp's unannounced convention on behalf of Modi was quite clear," Are you trying to save Joshi? Because they are from Vidarbha like Gadkari and other Sangh leaders? ”some Sangh leaders agreed with Modi's argument that there cannot be different criteria for different people
 vaise, modi ke kade sandesh kaa jawaab, sangh ke bheetar modi virdohi dhade se bhi kadaa hi aayaa tha, jisamen em
 Yes
 vaidya, manmohan vaidya, madhubhai kulkarni or vihip supremeo dow
 Praveen Togadia
 modi virdohi samooh ne kathith taur par aarope lagaaya ki sidi nakli thi or yah joshi ke rajnatik bhavishya ko khatm karne kii ek sajeesh thi or aisi ''khuraafaat karne waalon'' ko kathor sandesh dene ke liye hi joshi ko puri tarah se unka khoyaa sthaan waapas dilvaanaa hoga
 However, Modi continued to deny his role in the CD scandal and continued to provide proof that the CD was not fake
 modi ko apana paksh majboot karne kaa ek or mauka tab mila, jab uttar pradesh main bhaajapa ne munh kii khai
 This raised questions not only on Joshi but also on Gadkari's ability
 haalanki modi ke prachaar main nahin jane kii vajah se uttar pradesh main haar kii daleel kai netaaon ke gale nahin utarati
 He believes that Modi did not even go to campaign in Punjab, Goa and Uttarakhand
 sawaal yah bhi uth rahaa he ki uttar pradesh main joshi vajah the, to modi baaki rajyon main kyon nahin gaye? haalanki uttar pradesh kii haar ke baad rajyasabha ke liye tikat baantne main manmarjee ne gadakari ke khilaaf ek maahaul bana diya
 Advani and Sushma Swaraj objected to Gadkari's working style
 lekin is puure vivaad main tisare paksh ke rup main sankat ko taalane main arun jetali kii bhoomika ahm rahi
 Jaitley is considered close to both Gadkari and Modi and he is the one who has repeatedly persuaded Gadkari on the issue of Joshi
 modi-joshi kii ranjish nai nahin he, isaki shuruyaat nabbe ke dashak ke madhya main hui thi jab joshi ko modi ke tahat prashikshan ke liye laayaa gaya tha
 Modi was then the organization secretary of the Gujarat BJP
 modi ke samarthakon kii maane to joshi ke kathith doharepan se modi ajiz aa chuke the jo modi ke saamne to sidhe bane rahete the lekin peeth peeche sangh ke kuch bade netaaon se unki shikaayat karte the
 On the other hand, Joshi's supporters make the same allegations on Modi
 baharhaal, is sankat kaa samaadhaan bhaajapa ke liye badi raahat lekar aayaa he
 There was no talk between Gadkari and Modi for the last eight months
 jaahir he, parrty ke saamne yah sankat bada tha, jis par fori viraam jaruri tha
 However, the final resolution of this dispute is yet to be made and it is possible only after the assembly elections

 Shah Rukh Khan also meets his fans often, not breaking his heart
 aisa hi kuch vakya ipel 2019 main kolkata nite rides ke match ke dauraan dekhne ko mila, jahaan shahrukh khan ne apane divyang fain se mulaakaat kii
 This special fan of Shahrukh Khan had a dream to meet him
 kolkata ke eden garden main ipel match ke dauraan speciali abled fain stadium main shahrukh khan se mulaakaat kaa intjaar kar rahaa tha
 Then King Khan met Fan without delay
 video main wo shahrukh khan ko baar baar 'ai lav you' kah rahaa he
 The Divyang fan sitting in a wheelchair is excited to see his favorite actor

 unhone apane fain se kuch second ke liye baat kii
 Then hugged him and kissed him flying

 actor ke workfrant kii baat karen to unki pichhali relies jiro box offis par dharashaayi hui
 After this, the film Badla was released under the actor's production
 jisamen amitabh bachchan or taapasi panni lead role main dikhe
 Movie Badla Ticket is making a grand earning at the window
 film 'kamaal dhamal maalamaal' sikval he maalamaal vikali kii
 
 
 Though the story is new, most of the actors working in the film are old
 om puri ke bete ritesh deshmukh kii jagah lee he shreyas talapade ne or heroin madhurima ke alaava naanaa patekar kii nai entry he
 In 'malamal Weekly' the entire village was running for lottery money while in 'kamal Dhamaal Malamal' only Shreyas Talpade is dreaming of becoming a millionaire through lottery
 bilkul nikamme hai or darpok bhi jo gaanv ke bacchon se bhi maar khaataa rahata he
 It is a habit to beat up your Mehbooba brothers, so the villagers call Shreyas by the name of 'goat'
 isi bich, naanaa patekar kii entry hoti he jo taaqatvar he isliye use shreyas apana khoyaa hua bada bhai banaakar sabake saamne pesh karata he
 The comments naanaa patekar jab bhi munh kholte hai vah khaane ke liye hi kholte hai yani naanaa ke film main dialog nahin hai bas dher sara khaanaa he
 Despite the dialogue, Nana has good expressions
 shreyas ne acha abhinay kiya he or tamaam kalakaaron kaa acha saport mila he
 Some scenes are good which will make you laugh a lot
 lekin, diarector priyadarshan kaa yah best cinema nahin he
 No music roll
 first haaf main film ne pakad banaai he lekin second haaf thodi kamazor pad gai
 You can watch the film once but not with high expectations
 film ke liye meri reating he 2
 5 stars
 'maalamaal vikali' main lottery ke paison ke liye puraa gaanv daud rahaa tha jabaki 'kamaal dhamal maalamaal' main sirf shreyas talapade lottery ke zariye karodpati banane kaa sapana dekh rahe hai
 They are absolutely useless and also Dorpok who keeps on beating the children of the village
 apni mahabuuba ke bhaaiyon se pitnaa isaki aadat he isliye gaanv ke log shreyas ko 'bakrii' ke naam se bulaate he
 Meanwhile, there is an entry of Nana Patekar who is a strongman, so Shreyas presents him to everyone before making him his lost elder brother
 tippaniyan Whenever Nana Patekar opens his mouth, he opens it only for food, that is, there is no dialogue in Nana's film, just a lot of food
 dialog na hote hue bhi naanaa ke achche expressant hai
 Shreyas has done well and has got good support from all the actors
 kuch seens achche hai jo aapako koob hansaaenge
 But, this is not the best cinema of director Priyadarshan
 sangeet kaa koi role nahin
 The film caught on in the first half but the second half weakened a bit
 film ko ek baar dekh sakate hai lekin zyada ummiido ke saath nahin
 My rating for the film is 2
 5 star

 The US has said that it will not mediate on Kashmir until India approves such an offer
 america ne saath hi pakistan se sarkari niti ke aujaar ke rup main aatankwaad ke istemaal se bachane ko kaha
 US Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan James Dobins told Pakistan's state-run TV channel Pakistan Television (PTV), "unless India approves any real arbitration, we can't do much specifically about it
" haal main pakistan daure par gaye dobins ne kaha, bharat lagaataar kisi tisare paksh kii madhyasthata ko khaarij karata rahaa he or uskaa kahana he ki is mudde (kashmir) par bina kisi tisare paksh kii hissedari ke sidhi baatcheet kii jarurat he
 Therefore they have rejected arbitration
 dobins ne kaha, mujhe lagata he ki jab tak vah madhyasthata ko khaarij karte rahenge, america yaa koi doosraa paksh ek seemaa tak hi kuch kar paaegaa
 We certainly promote better relations, better trade relations, better dialogue on strategic and military issues in our interactions with Pakistan and India
 saath hi donon deshon ko alag karne vaale kshetreey muddon par baatcheet evam charchaa ko bhi badhaava dete hai
 Article 370 and 35A applicable in Kashmir is in controversy, meanwhile a post on social media is going viral
 isamen daawa kiya ja rahaa he ki agar jammu-kashmir kii koi mahila bharat ke kisi anya rajya ke vyakti se shaadi karti he to us mahila kii naagarikta khatm ho jaaegi
 On the other hand, if she marries a person from Pakistan then that person will also get citizenship of Jammu and Kashmir
 india today ke anti phek news war room (AFWA) ne padtaal main paaya ki artical 35A ke praavdhaanon kaa hawaale se kiya gaya daawa puri tarah se galat he
 The post archived version can be viewed here
 fasebuk par"rochak tathy"naam ke pej ne yah post kiya he jise khabar likhe jane tak 3700 se zyada log share kar chuke the
 To get to the bottom of the matter, we searched the internet about article 35A talking about citizenship and rights of Jammu and Kashmir
 hamenxirstpostka ek news artical mila
 In this article, state government lawyer Ishaq Qadri was quoted as saying that in October 2002, the Jammu and Kashmir High Court granted the State and Others Vs
 sushila saahane and adars ke cese main faisla dete hue rajya ke sthaayee nivasee kanoon ke us praavdhaan ko radd kiya tha, jiske anusaar kisi anya rajya ke vyakti se vivaah karne ke baad sthaayee nivasee kii beti kaa jammu-kashmir kii sthaayee nivasee hone kaa ohada chhin jaataa tha
 This means that even after marrying any outsider, the woman of Jammu and Kashmir will remain a permanent resident there and will have all the rights, including rights over property
 hoicourt ke is aadesh ko pidipi-congress ke gathbandhan vaali sarkaar ne supreme court main chunauti di thi, lekin baad main unhone is yachika ko waapas le liya
 Apart from this, according to Article 35A, if a Kashmiri girl marries an outsider, the man does not get the citizenship or other rights of Kashmir
 bahari purush anya rajya yaa kisi bhi desh kaa ho saktaa he
 Can not buy land: Under Jammu and Kashmir, special status has been granted to Jammu and Kashmir, due to which the state also has some special rights
 lihaaja jo bhi vyakti jammu-kashmir kaa nivasee nahin he vah yahaan jameen nahin kharid saktaa
 Such a rule is also applicable in some other states like Himachal Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland
 bijepi ke menifesto main bhi zikrloksabhaa chunaav 2019 se pehle bijepi ne apanesankalp patramen anuchhed 370 hataane kii baat doharaai thi

 The sarkaar ke pehle ek saal main bhrashtachar ke kisi bade maamle kaa saamne na aana sirf raahat kii baat he, mahotsav kii haragij nahin
 Grand corruption does not occur in the first year of governments
 centre main upie kii sarkaar se lekar rajyon tak darjanon udhaaharan isaki taakid karte hai ki puraani hoti sarkarein bhrashtachar ke khatre ke kareeb khisakati jaati hai
 The UPA scandals came out in the last years of his second term
 zyada chintaa is baat par honi chahie ki narendra modi sarkaar ne puraa saal un jaruri sansthaaon ko banane yaa majboot kiye bagaiyr bitaa diya he jo ek vishaal desh ke jatil tantra main saaf-suthere kaamkaaj ke liye jaruri hai
 In the first year, Modi neither gave strength to the constitutional bodies keeping watch over the government machinery nor corrected the regulatory reforms
 nigahabaani sansthaaen sarkaron kaa suraksha chakra hoti hai or swatantra niamak khule bazaar kaa
 Due to the absence of this security cycle, the Modi government's risks in terms of transparency have increased
 pichley ek saal ke faislon or unhen lene ke tareekon ko gaharaai se parakhane par sarkaar main gavarnence kii duvidha jhalkane lagati he
 It is not just about the appointment of the Central Vigilance Commissioner or the Central Information Commissioners for a year, for which the Prime Minister met for the first time last week after the opposition's comments
 hakeekat yah he ki lokapal kii sthapana se lekar vibhinn kshetron main niamak banane tak, sarkaar pichley saal main ek inch bhi aage nahin bad saki
 The choice is between centralized versus decentralized governance
 modi satta ke kendrikaran ko chunate rahe hai, jisamen lokapal yaa satarkta ayog jaisi sansthaaon yaa swatantra aarthik niamakon ke liye jagah mushkil se banati he
 While the model of governance developed in India after the economic reforms, the power of the government and the autonomous institutions keeping a watch on the market has increased
 doorsanchaar, bijli beemaa or vittiya sevaaon tak khule bazaar ko niamakon ne bakhubi sambhala he jabaki supreme court or sieji jaisi sanvaidhanik sansthaaon ne sarkaron kii nigahabaani kii he
 Conflicts like rights, delays in decisions have arisen from this new system, but they have also proved useful in handling the huge market and arbitrary political system of a large country
 modi sarkaar apane pehle ek saal main gavarnence ke is badale hue dhaanche par thos raay kaayam nahin kar saki jisase na keval ek tadarthwaad paidaa hua he, balki rigerv bank ke adhikaar kam karne kii muhim ne yah bataaya he ki sarkaar swatantra niamakon ko lekar sahaj nahin hai
 Ideally, the process of reallocation of coal mines should have been decided by an independent regulator
 yadi aavanton main jaldi thi to uske tatkaal baad koyala niamak bananaa chahie tha taaki koyale kii gunvattta tay karne, companiyon ke vivaad nibatane, khanan kii monitoring karne or koyale kii keemat nirdhaarit karne main sarkaar kaa dakhal kam hota
 The allocation of mines has been done but due to lack of regulatory, opacity and ad-hocism in the coal sector remains the same
 railway main videshi nivesh paravaan kyon nahin chadha? railway ke liye niyam banane kaa kaam kisi swatantra regulator ko dena hoga taaki bazaar main barabari kii pratispardhaa ho sake
 The Bibek Debroy committee was formed by the Modi government to improve the railways, but when the committee recommended to make the regulator, the government was lethargic
 vimaanan, vittiya sevaaon or real estate main regulator banane par bhi koi sakriyata najar nahin ai he
 Modi should have initiated the formation of Lokpal in his first year
 lekin yahaan to ek saal main kendriya satarkta ayog ke adhyaksh kaa chayan bhi nahin ho sakaa
 This is the best chance for Modi to prove his resolve regarding transparency, as the BJP has been in favor of a powerful regulator like Lokpal for the government machinery from the beginning
 kaala dhan jaise kanoonon ke jariye sarkari adhikariyon ko nai takat se las kiya ja rahaa he, is takat kii nigahabaani ke liye sanvaidhanik sansthaaon kaa gathan or majbootee, darasal paardarshita ko lekar sarkaar ke kaul ko or mukhar karegi
 Modi's governance model is becoming a vision for states
 pichley baarah maheenon main jis tarah pradhanmantri karyaalay main satta kaa kendrikaran badha he, thik usee tarj par rajyon main mukhyamantri karyaalayon ne bhi shaktiyaan sameti hai
 The Center has at least the SAG, the Supreme Court and other active agencies that can monitor governance, states have neither a vigilance structure nor the courts have the watchdog experience
 rajyon main abhi niamak sudhaar shuru bhi nahin hue hai jabaki nijeekaran or sarkari kharch ke agle bade aayojan rajyon main hi hone hai
 Monitoring and regulating institutions share the rights of the government which no political leader wants to give easily
 narendra modi ne bhale gujarat ke mukhyamantri ke taur par lokayukta kii takat ko simit rakhaa ho yaa swatantra niamak banane par bahut dhyaan na diya ho lekin pradhanmantri ke taur par unhen lokapal banane, satarkta dhaanche majboot karne or niamak sudhaaron main der nahin kerani chahie
 The government has realized in a year that it is not magic to bring good days, similarly running a clean government in the open market is also not magic
 netritv ke paardarshee hona, puure system ke saaf-suthra hone kii guarantee nahin bhi he
 All decisions in this government are Prime Minister-centric, so if the government slips on the transparency front, then the defections will also be recorded in the Prime Minister's account
 majboot or taqatvar niamak-nigahbaan sansthaaon kaa suraksha chakra banaakar hi modi is jokhim ko simit kar sakate hai
 Will they be able to do this? jammu evam kashmir cricket sangh (jekeese) ne matdaan ke jariye rajya ke purv mukhyamantri or neshnal conference ke netaa farrukh abdulla ko adhyaksh pad se hataa diya he
 According to Manjur Wazir of Abdullakashmir Gymkhana Club, after 35 years, 42 out of 64 cricket clubs affiliated to the State Cricket Association participated in the internal voting
 vajeer ne bataaya ki rajya ke khel mantri imran raja ansaari ko jekeese kaa nayaa adhyaksh chunaa gaya he
 Mehboob Iqbal has been appointed as the new chairman, Mohammad Iqbal as general secretary and Abdul Rauf as treasurer
 aapako bataa den ki 1980 main pehali baar rajya cricket sangh ke pramukh chune jane ke baad yah pehla mauka he jab abdulla ne jekeese par se apana niyantran khoyaa he

 up mukhyamantri ne kaha ki sonia gandhi ke saath meeting ke dauraan yah tay hua he ki ham kis tarah se party or sarkaar donon ko saath lekar chalem
 For this, we have to create a mechanism and how can we give participation to party workers who have helped to form the government
 iske bare main hamen miljul kar aage kaam karnaa he
 Workers should be heard
 sachin payalat ne kaha ki loktantr main janata hi maai-baap hota he
 Fearing that people will tell the problem and it will not be solved, then their resentment will increase
 ham janata kaa dukh dard sunanaa band nahin kar sakate hai
 We will give relief to as many people as we can
 janata darbar main kuch berozegaar bhi mili jinhone kaha ki naukari ke liye aae the magar lollypop ke alaava kuch nahin mila

 Annoyed by the news of the killing of two soldiers in Jammu and Kashmir, social activist Anna Hazare on Thursday sought to teach Pakistan a lesson similar to 1965
 hajaare ne kaha ki unhone jo kuch kiya he vah katai manjuur nahin
 How did they kill our soldiers and keep walking with their heads? No person will tolerate this

 chunaav kii har khabar milegi sidhe aapke inbox main
 To stay updated with the latest news of the general election, subscribe to the upcoming Election Special News Letter congress adhyaksha sonia gandhi ne somvaar kii raat vibhinn tivi channelon ke jariye sandesh main janata se apil main kaha ki vartmaan loksabhaa chunaav is desh ke logon ko baantne waalon se 'bharat kaa dil or ruh' bachaane kii ladaai he
 Without naming Narendra Modi or BJP, Sonia said, 'we want unity
 ve ekarupata thopanaa chaahate hai
 They say, only believe in 'I'
 ' sonia ne kaha ki pyaar or sammaan, samanta or bhaichara tathaa ahimsa hamaari mathrubhumi ke dil or ruh hai or ham in chunaavon main isi dil or ruh ko un logon se bachaane ke liye lard rahe hai jo ise badalanaa or hamen baantnaa chaahate hai
 Speaking as the fiercest attack on the BJP in the election campaign so far, Sonia requested the public to defeat the divisive and autocratic forces that would destroy Indian values
 sonia ne logon se congress kaa samarthan karne kii apil karte hue bhaajapa par har taraf se nishaanaa saadhaa or kaha ki vipakshi party kii soch nafrat or jhooth se bhari he or uski vichaardhaara vibhaajankaree or nirankush he
 Sonia said, 'his attitude full of hate and lies, his divisive and autocratic ideology will lead to the downfall of our Indianness and Hindustaniyat
 ' sonia gandhi ne kaha, 'ham is chunaav main ek aise bharat ke liye sangharsh kar rahe hai, jisamen satta kuch chand logon kii nahin ho balki jis par sabakaa baraabar adhikaar ho

 gorakhpur purvanchal kii sabase hot seat maani jaati he
 The reason is that Gorakhpur is the seat of Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath
 mukhyamantri banane ke pehle yogi is seat se paanch baar saansad bane
 The first time he won in 1998 was 21 thousand votes and then his winning margin increased
 usase pehle mahant avaidhyanath 1991 se 1998 tak bijepi ke tikat par jite or 1989 se 1990 main hindu mahasabha se jite
 But in the by-election held after Yogi became the Chief Minister, Pravin Nishad won by 21
5 thousand votes
 nishad sapa-basapa ke sanyukt ummidavaar the
 This time the BJP has nominated Bhojpuri actor Ravi Kishan from Gorakhpur
 sapa-basapa gathbandhan se ram bhuwan nishad maidan main hai to congress ne madhusudan treepathi ko tikat diya he, jo jati se brahman hai
 There are three and a half lakh Nishad voters in Gorakhpur and 3 lakh Brahmins
 is tarah se congress ne brahman ummidavaar utarkar bijepi ke liye mushkil khadi kar di he kyonki madhusudan treepathi sthaneey hai, peshey se vakil hai or apni jati main lokapriy hai
 But it has been a BJP stronghold
 is vakt yahaan kii paanchon vidhansabha siton par bijepi kaa kabja he
 BJP has been winning since 18 years
 san 2014 main yogi adityanath ko kareeb 52 fisadi vot mili the jabaki sapa-basapa ko milakar 38 fisadi
 In the by-election, Yogi was said to be upset over not being given his choice of mind
 nateeja hua ki bijepi yah seat haar gai, praveen kumaar nishad chunaav jeet gaye
 This time it has happened that Praveen Kumar has joined BJP and BJP has given him ticket from Sant Kabir Nagar by not giving him ticket from Gorakhpur
 jabaki gathbandhan ne rambhual nishad ko maidan main utaara he or mana ja rahaa he ki unhen kareeb 80 fisadi nishadon kaa sarmathan hasil he
 This is the reason that difficulties are increasing for Ravi Kishan
 unke bhojpuri staradam ke baavjood gorakhpur main maamla kuch jam nahin rahaa he kyonki nishad voton ke alaava gathbandhan ke paas muslim, yadav or dalit vot to hai hi jo majbootee se unke saath khadaa he
 At the same time, the Congress has made the condition of the BJP worse by making a dent in the Brahmin vote
 yahi vajah he ki gorakhpur kii seat mukhyamantri yogi ke saath pradhanmantri modi ke liye bhi pratishtha kii seat ban gai he
 Even after the Lok Sabha elections, there does not seem to be any dissolution in Bengal
 bijepi ko ore se jagah-jagah nikaale ja rahe vijay juluus kaa virodh ho rahaa he
 In Burdwan, BJP workers have been threatened by putting up posters in the name of Jai Bangla
 is dhamkee main kaha gaya he ki agar bijepi kaaryakarta juluus nikaalte hai to unki hatya kar di jaaegi
 On Friday, posters have been pasted in the style of Maoists in the name of Jai Bangla at the houses of several BJP workers in Rathtala, Burdwan
 is poster main juluus main shaamil hone athwa jhanda lagane kii sthiti main hatya karne tak kii dhamkee di gai he
 The BJP has accused TMC workers of putting up these posters
 bardwan bijepi nagar cameti ke sadsy prashanth raay ne bataaya ki pichley 4 taarikh ko hi unhone vijay juluus kii anumati lee thi, lekin achaanak se guuruuvaar raat prashasan kii ore se unhen is baat kii soochna di gai ki vijay juluus yojit nahin kiya ja sakegaa
 Prashant Rai said that along with his house, posters have been pasted in the style of Maoists in the house of several other BJP workers in the name of Jai Bangla, threatening to join the procession or kill in the event of flagging
 
 hamane bardwan thane main shikaayat darj karai he
 TMC workers are behind all this
 ham ise lekar andolan bhi karenge
 Khok Das, general secretary of tmc's Burdwan, described the allegation as false and said that BJP workers had put up these posters
 bataa den, kuch din pehle bengal main tiemasi ke do kaaryakartaaon kii hatya kar di gai thi
 The TMC accused the BJP leaders of the murder
 mamata banerjee ne kaha ki bijepi ne dhokhe se 18 siten jeet leen
 Mamta Banerjee had said, 'we want justice
 doshiyon ko bakhsha nahin ja saktaa
 My DG is here
 jo log sajeeshkarta hai unki chaanbin honi chahie
 He (BJP) cheated and won 18 seats but he cannot kill people nor spread violence
 ' mamata banerjee ne kaha, '1984 main indira gandhi kii jab maut hui, tab hinsa bhadak gai thi lekin bijepi hinsa failaa rahi he
 Violence has increased where BJP has won

 The temple is usually closed at 12:30 pm
 ‘shuddhikaran' kii prakriya ke kaaran shraddhaluon ko mandir se baahar jane ko kaha gaya
 There was talk of the temple being opened after the completion of this process
 isse pehle donon mahilaon ne 24 disambar ko bhi mandir main pravesh kii koshish kii thi, lekin virodh ke kaaran unhen lautnaa padaa tha

 However, the Supreme Court has fixed the hearing date on January 11 on the reconsideration petitions filed in this regard
 court ne saaf kiya tha ki tab tak supreme court ke aadesh par koi roak nahin rahegi

 Why the authorities did not take any action on those preparations? Why did the Art of Living not accept the terms and conditions? The NGT asked the DDA
 The NGT asked the DDA what according to them is the active flood plane of the Yamuna? How long will it take to heal
 iske jawaab par didie ne kaha ki unke paas visheshgy nahin hai
 On this answer, Pranraj NGT said that when they do not know how long it will take to cure Yamuna, then how can they say that it will take 10 years or 50 years

 There is a continuing debate over 'one nation, one election'

 Meanwhile, the assessment of the upcoming elections to be held in the year 2019 should also be in view of the data

 To conduct 543 Lok Sabha seats almost simultaneously, including 9
 30 lakh matdaan kendron kaa prabandhan karnaa hota he, jahaan 90 karod voter aate hai
 It is considered the most reliable election in the world
 bharat main kisi bhi desh ke mukaable sabase zyada matadaata hai
 At the same time, elections will certainly open up possibilities for maximum utilization of resources, but while there will be a tremendous increase in the needs of some (possibly double or more), some will not increase proportionately

 chitthee ke mutabik party ke in netaaon par party supremeomulaayam singh yadavake khilaaf apmanjanak tippanee karne, anushaasanheen aacharan karne or party virdohi gatividhiyon main shaamil hone kaa aarope lagaaya gaya he
 The Election Commission is preparing to hand over those who questioned the evms
 khaskar AAP, congress, sapa, basapa, or tiemasi ne iviem main chhedchhad kaa aarope lagaaya he
 However, whenever the parties questioned the EVM, the Election Commission rejected the allegations outright
 lekin ab jaakar chunaav ayog ne bhi sabhi partiyon ko open chalange diya he
 For this, the parties will be given 4-4 hours time on behalf of the Commission, so that they show the desired changes in the EVMA
 EVM par sawaal uthaane waalon ko chunautichunaav ayog ke mutabik sabhi 7 rashtriya dal or 48 rajya stareey dalon ko khuli chunauti main hissaa lene ke liye 3 june se baari-bari bulaayaa jayega
 For this, the commission will give 4 hours time to the parties who accept the challenge to tamper with the EVM of any polling station in the recently concluded assembly elections of 5 states
 haalanki ayog ne saaf kar diya he ki internal parts badalane nahin diya jayega, kyonki AAP netaa ne chand senkend main madraboard badalane kaa daawa kiya tha
 The allegation of tampering of evms was dismissed, however, with Chief Election Commissioner Naseem Zaidi again reiterating that those who are questioning the credibility of evms have not yet produced any evidence or credible evidence to support their claim
 jaidi ne kaha ki iviem main koi chhedchhad sambhav nahin he
 But if anyone has doubts, then it is the responsibility of all the parties to improve the election process
 iviem ke aantarik saftware ko badalanaa sambhav nahin he
 AAP had hacked in 90 seconds, the biggest question on Daivim has been raised by the Aam Aadmi Party of Delhi
 party kii ore se is masale ko lekar isi maheene ke pehle hafte main vidhansabha kaa vishesh satr bulaayaa gaya tha, jisamen AAP ke vidhayak saurabh bharadwaj ne ek iviem tip mashin kii live tempring kaa live demo dikhaaya tha
 Sourav Bhardwaj had claimed that evms could be hacked in just 90 seconds, which caused a stir in politics streets
 vidhansabha main saurabh ne daawa kiya tha ki ek sikret code ke jariye EVM se chhedchhad sambhav he
 He had given the demo that the code is secretly inserted during voting
 code daalane ke baad har vot ek khaas party ko jaataa he
 Not only this, if Saurav believes, evm's mother board can also be tampered by changing
 koi aisi mashin nahin, jiske saath chhedchhad na kii ja sake
 This tempering is not easy to catch
 saurabh kaa kahana tha ki sirf madraboard se chhedchhad karke nattejey badale ja sakate hai or to or saurabh bharadwaj ne daawa kiya he ki gujarat vidhansabha ke liye istemaal main hone vaali mashiinon ko sirf teen ghante ke liye unhen de diya jaae
 He claims that BJP will not be able to win a single seat
 kaha he ki madar board main sikret code se chhedchhad sambhav he saurabh ne duniya bhar ke vaigyanikon ko bhi chunaiti di
 The question was raised by the opposition on the election process
 38-year-old Saurabh Bhardwaj has done the engineering and has worked in major multinational companies for nearly ten years before joining the Aam Aadmi Party
 vahiin AAP netaa sanjay singh ne kaha chaa ki chunaav ayog ke afasaron or camere ke saamne AAP ke export mashin kii sachai desh ke saamne laaenge
 Now the Election Commission has fixed the date and the truth of AAP claims will be revealed
 jiske baad dilli ke mukhyamantri kejariwal ne daawa kiya tha ki desh main EVM ko lekar bijepi ko jitaane kii jo badi sajeesh chal rahi he isse chunaav prakriya par se logon kaa vishwaas uth rahaa he
 Apart from this, during a press conference in Delhi, the AAP had questioned the Election Commission saying that it is very unfortunate that the EC is talking about giving a demo in front of the media only by not accepting the opposition, when 18 parties question the EVM If they are standing up and they are not being heard, then this is a serious question for democracy
 12 may ko hui thi sarvadaleey baithkgauratlab he ki chunaav ayog ne iviem main gadabadiyon kii shikaayat par 12 may ko sabhi politicil partiyon kii meeting bulaai thi
 In the meeting, the Commission had openly challenged all political parties to show tampering of evms on complaints of EVM disturbances during the five state assembly elections
 lekin us vakt chif ellection kamishnar naseem jaidi ne ne kisi taarikh kii ghoshnaa nahin kii thi

 On the warm meeting between Nitish and Advani at the NIC meeting held in Delhi on Monday, RJD Principal General Secretary Ramkripal Yadav accused the BJP and JDU of 'match fixing' of secular votes in the next Lok Sabha election, saying that Narendra Modi's name But Nitish, who broke away from BJP, is still with Advani

 The anger and dissatisfaction prevailing among Muslims on the Ayodhya verdict will be reflected in the results of the Bihar assembly elections
 is samay vidhansabha chunaav ke daur se guzar rahe bihar main musalmaan-desh bhar main maujuud samudaay ke anya logon kii tarah-samaan rup se gusse main hai or dukhi hai, or iskaa kaaran ayodhya maamle par hycourt kaa faisla he
 But unlike the others, the Muslims of the state have the opportunity to express their fury instead of kneeling inside, and this is gathering the opportunity for the assembly elections
 is baat ke spasht sanket mil rahe hai ki muslim apni udaseenta ko bhula denge or chunaav ke din apana puraa gussa nikaal denge
 But, which party or coalition will be the biggest loser? Will it be JD (U) of Nitish Kumar, who is teaming with LK Advani's BJP? Or the Congress will have to bear the brunt of welcoming the verdict in addition to its "historical mistakes" - although many before the verdict believed that Muslims were returning to the Congress
 aise muslimon kii sankhya bhi acchhee-khaasi he jo vivaadon se bachate hue sahi baat karte najar aa rahe hai
 But, when it comes to the electoral analysis, they believe in being fair
 samim ansaari, kontract par kaam kar rahe ek adhyaaapak, kuch nihitarthon kaa put liye baaten karte hai
 Ansari, 37, from Aurangabad district in Bihar says, "when the Supreme Court asked the government to distribute food grains to the poor for free, the Prime Minister advised him not to interfere in policy making
" 
 lekin jab elahabaad hycourt ne bhramit or sabhi ko 'santusht' karne vaala faisla diya to congress ne iskaa swaagat kiya or vah hamase chaahati he ki ham bhi ise sweekaar karke aage kii sud len
 Aren't these double standards? "ansari emphasizes that his stand on congressional approval of the Allahabad High Court's decision represents not only his own but the entire community's thinking
 ve kehete hai, ''iskaa asar hoga
 For me, in the context of JD (U) 's alliance with BJP, Lalu Prasad Yadav deserves a big win
 lekin congress ke is nuksaan kaa phayda anya raajnneetik dalon ko mil saktaa he
 "however, the Manmohan Singh government has dealt with this issue very carefully and Kanni seems to be reeling from the implementation of the court's verdict on the Ayodhya case, which the decision says and the acceptance of the Congress about it, is very important in electoral Bihar Where, according to the Economic Survey of Bihar 2009-10 - Muslim share of the total population of the state is 16
 53 fisadi he
 It can be said that out of the 243 assembly seats in Bihar, 60 Muslim votes are electorally important and Araria (41)
 14 %), purniya (36
 76%), Katihar (42
 53 %) or kishanganj (67
 58%) are deciding on 24 seats in districts
 rajya kii 50 anya siton par nateezon ko badalane kii kuwwat rakhte hai
 Not only this, the latest trend of Muslims is being seen, it was never predicted before the Ayodhya verdict
 hycourt kaa faisla aane se pehle lagaae ja rahe sabhi kayaason main musalamaanon kaa samarthan congress kii jheli main jane ke kayaas lagaae ja rahe the, jiskaa ek kaaran bhaajapa dwaara apane mukhya matadaataaon kaa ekikaran kiye jane ko bhi mana ja rahaa tha
 But as soon as the verdict came, the BJP maintained absolute silence on the verdict against expectations, possibly due to pressure from Nitish Kumar
 chunavi bayaar main bah rahe bihar main faisle ko lekar muslimon kii hataasha congress virdohi lahar main bhi tabdeel ho sakati he
 However, the Congress seems fully aware of this issue
 party ne chunaav maidan main 49 muslim ummidavaaron ko utaara he or yah kisi bhi party dwaara utaare gaye muslim ummidavaaron kaa sarvaadhik aankada he
 The party's hope behind this is that they will not allow Muslims to become disenchanted with the Congress
 lekin, abhi yah kahana jaldbaaji hoga ki congress ne acchhee-khaasi sankhya main muslim ummidavaaron ko chunaav maidan main utaar kar alpsankhyak khinchaav ko kaaphi had tak kam kar diya he
 It is also believed that Muslims vote on the basis of religious background, the Congress can imagine that a lot will come on its part
 swaabhaavik taur par party ummid kar rahi he ki congress ke muslim ummidavaar apane samudaay ke logon ko sookshm str par aakarshith karne main kaamyaab ho sakenge
 Mufti Mohammed Sanaul Houda, deputy secretary of Sharia, a prestigious Sharia-based Muslim socio-religious organization in Patna, recounts the pain of the Qasmi Muslims but insists that it does not target the Congress alone
 ve kehete hai, ''ham faisle kaa sammaan karte hai, lekin iske myne yah nahin he ki ham ise sweekaar bhi karte hai
 Like Congressmen, everyone is free to express his views
 lekin, koun kya kah rahaa he is mudde ko lekar zyada jaagrukta nahin hai
 Muslims can vote in favor of or against Congressmen
 lekin, congressi khule taur par faisle kaa samarthan karte najar aae hai is kaaran se sirf 10 fisadi se zyada muslimon ke prabhavit hone kii sambhaavna he
 Not more than this
 '' kaasmi kaa yah bhi maananaa he ki anya samudaayon kii apeksha muslim yuva zyada khinn najar aa rahe hai
 He says, "this is because it is a thoughtful and aware generation
 iske alaava, muslimon ke dhade dharmik aadhaar par bhi vot de sakate hai
 "in Patna Haj Bhavan, college student Nasim Siddiqui does not find words to express his frustration
" unka kahana he, ''faisle ne na sirf muslimon ko shikast di he balki isane bharat kii dharmanirpekshata par bhi ek bada prashnchinh laga diya he
 "this 22-year-old youth from Hajipur, who serves Haj pilgrims in his spare time, is completely upset with the chameleon-like style of the leaders
 unhone badi hi safagoi se kaha, ''main vot nahin daaloongaa
 What will happen with this? Not only this, our group of 150 Muslim youth will boycott the elections this time instead of voting for the greedy leaders of power
 '' uski aawaaj shant ho jaati he lekin ek bechaini kaa bhav uske chehre par saaf najar aata he
 Kahakshan Qureshi, a 21-year-old looking for a PG Diploma in Advertising and Marketing, calls for "to move forward"
 haalanki kehkashan ayodhya faisle ko lekar acha mahasoos nahin karti hai lekin ve jor detii hai ki ye samay vaastavik masalon par dhyaan dene kaa he
 She says, "I am looking for a job
 rojgaar meri chintaa kaa pehla vishay he
 The main issues are inflation, economy, health, education
 donon samudaayon ke paas puja-ibaadat ke liye paryaapt sthaan hai
 "kahkans are not ignorant of the real facts and they will vote to express their opinions
" unka kahana he, ''beshak, samudaay kii is dasha ke liye congress kaaphi had tak jimmedaar he-pratikatmak or vaastavik donon myanon main
 Personally, i would prefer to choose Nitish Kumar over Lalu Prasad because i have heard about those dark days
 ''nitish kumaar ke samarthan vaali ye awaajen kuch anya madhyavargeey muslimon main bhi suni ja sakati hai
 But 44-year-old Afak Akhtar, who runs a drugstore in Patna, regrets that the minorities lack options
 akhtar kehete hai, ''lekin, yah sabaki tarah he
 We do not have a single leader of our choice
 ''haalanki afak is baat se sahamat hai ki congress dwaara faisle kaa samarthan karne se rajya main party kii sambhaavnaaon par beshak asar padegaa
 His wife Rubina Akhtar believes that Muslims will have to choose from Lalu and Nitish
 ve kahati hai, ''un siton par jahaan se nitish kii gathbandhan sahyogi bhaajapa chunaav lard rahi he vahaan muslim lalu ko vot daalana pasand karenge
 It is believed that if the favorable conditions do not arise after the election, then the Congress will come with the RJD and complete the vacuum
 ''jad (you) bhi puri tarah se saavdhaan he
 a joint rally with the BJP has not been executed yet
 laalkrishna adwani kaa pehla daura 19 aktubar ko hua tha-pehle charan ke matdaan ke liye prachaar kaa aakhri din
 Incidentally, Advani has been kept away from the 47 seats where there is a significant presence of Muslims - the seats are to be held on October 21
 haalanki bihar kii chunavi raajnneeti main abhi faisla aana baaki he
 The impact of the Ayodhya verdict and the stance of political parties is also not recognizable at the moment
 aisa lagata he ki adhiktar log abhi is baat kaa akalan nahin kar paa rahe hai ki kis tarah se yah sab muslimon ko prabhavit karegaa
 But the issue has been seen to cause religious polarization in the past, undoubtedly a wave of provocation may once again reinforce the minority community, overwhelmed with anger and sorrow, to take a firm decision

 The Raghuram Rajan Committee report on the joint development index of states has recently been published and people are commenting that Gujarat is not doing well
 gujarat kaa pradarshan acha na hone kaa tark, khaskar maanav vikaas ke maamle main nayaa nahin he
 When it comes to data, there is an absolute figure and there is a figure in which increments keep growing
 in donon main antar hota he
 Take for example the per capita domestic product of a state
 agar main sampurna aankade kii baat karun to isamen punjab sabase upar hoga, bihar se kaaphi aage
 But if you look at the increasing figures, Bihar will be at the top of this category, far ahead of Punjab
 in donon ke base yani aadhaar main antar he
 Does this mean that Punjab is doing well or Bihar is performing poorly? i don't think so
 isi tarah, main nahin samajhataa ki gujarat ke vikaas kii kahani kabhi bhi base ke bare main rahi he
 It was about reform
 kuch aankadon se ise samajhate hai
 All India Literacy Rate 52 in the year 1991
 2 fisadi, 2001 main 65
 4 percent and in 2011 it was 74 percent
 gujarat kii sakshartaa dar varsh 1991 main 61
 2 percent, 69 in 2001
 1 fisadi or 2011 main 79
 Was 3 percent
 isi prakaar pratishat ke lihaaj se dekhen to 1991 se 2001 ke bich akhil bhartiya sakshartaa dar main gujarat se zyada sudhaar hua he, lekin 2001 se 2011 ke bich isamen gujarat se kam sudhaar hua he
 There is a similar trend in female literacy
 yaa gujarat main praathmik shiksha ke dauraan skool chhodie waalon kii dar kaa hi udhaaharan len
 This 20 in 2000-01 during first to fifth grade
 93 fisadi or 2011-12 main mahaj 2
 Was 07 percent
 antim udhaaharan ke taur par aaie linganupaat kii baat karte hai
 Among children across the country (0–6 years), the sex ratio was 945 in 1991, 927 in 2001 and 919 in 2011, while the child sex ratio in Gujarat was 928 in 1991, 883 in 2001 and 890 in 2011
 varsh 2001 se 2011 ke bich puure desh main bacchon ke linganupaat kii sthiti kharaab hui he, jabaki gujarat main maamuli sudhaar hua he
 However, the figure of 890 is still poor
 agar kisi ko sarkari nitiyon ke asar jaanane main dilchaspee ho to janm ke samay linganupaat ko bal linganupaat kaa ek vaikalpik sanketak mana ja saktaa he
 It was 984 in 2001 and 906 in 2011 across the country
 lekin gujarat main varsh 2001 main yah 837 tha or 2011 main 909
 i was willing to explain this reform as a positive effect of policies
 main sabhi sanketakon se kai or udhaaharan de saktaa hum, lekin isse sampurna banaam vruddhi kaa mudda or saath hi ghatnakram kii samasya khadi hoti he
 Older figures are mostly used in human development rankings
 udhaaharan ke liye pichhlaa swasthya surveykshan 2005-06 main kiya gaya tha
 It is important to remember this
 ab raghuram rajan samiti kii baat karte hai
 You have to do the following things in any state-wise ranking: (a) Identification of the factors affecting: Often the lack of data prevents you from including the factors that you wanted to include
 beemaari kii dar kii tarah paryaavaran iskaa ek acha udhaaharan he
 (B) Remove the method of normalization
 ek udhaaharan se samajhate hai, desh main kai bade or chote rajya hai
 To make comparisons between large states and small states possible, factors can be divided according to population or geographic region
 (si) chinhit karkon ke liye vettege yani bhaarank tay karen
 (D) decide the method of aggregation
 ye gambhir mudde hai
 Any change in them changes the index value and consequently the ranking
 isliye aapane (e) se lekar (di) tak jo bhi vikalp chune hai, uskaa auchity sabit karnaa padataa he or yah jaanchane ke liye ki aapaki index vailu kitni majboot he, ek tarah kii simulation eksrasij kerani padati he
 The Rajan Committee has accepted ten groups of factors: 1
 aay 2
 Education 3
 swasthya 4
 Index of amenities in every household 5
 garibi anupaat 6
 Female literacy rate 7
 jansankhya main anusuchit jati / anusuchit janajati (essi / asti) kaa pratishat 8
 Urbanization rate 8
 vittiya samavesh 10
 Connectivity Index
