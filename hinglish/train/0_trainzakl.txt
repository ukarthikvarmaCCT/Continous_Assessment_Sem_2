 punjab ke patiala kii ek adaalat ne maovadi netaa cobad gandhi ko chah saal pehle punjab uniwarsity main raashtra virdohi bhaashan dene ke aarope se buudhvaar ko bari kar diya
 Additional Sessions Judge Mohammad Gulzar pronounced this decision in this case, which is being heard everyday in Patiala since 27 September
 cobad gandhike khilaaf desh bhar main deshadroh jaise 15 maamle darj ho chuke hai
 After being acquitted in the case, 66-year-old Gandhi told reporters that he had distanced himself from the banned organization of the Communist Party of India
 yah cese thana sadarpatiyaalaaki police dwaara 23 janvari 2010 ko 10, 13, 18, 20 analophul activity amandamant act 2008 or bhartiya dand samhita kii dhara 419 or 120bi ke antargat darj kiya gaya tha
 In this, the police had claimed that Kikobad Gandhi gave a provocative speech at Punjabi University in 2009
 kendriya sarkaar main khaadya prasanskaran rajyamantri sadhvi niranjan jyoti ne jo abhadra bhashaa istemaal kii he, us par unhone maafi maang lee he
 But is it just a matter of hate speech? dilli ke jis bhaashan main unhone yah bhashaa istemaal kii usee main agali saans main ye kahati nazar ain ki jo apane−aap ko ram kii santan nahin maanata vah is desh main rahane kaa adhikari nahin he
 This statement is a reflection of the radical unity of Hindutva politics in which neither Hindutva understanding nor Indianness is visible
 kyonki sadhvi jyoti yah bhul gayi ki jise vah hindutv maanati hai or jise apni raajnneeti ke tahat ek jivan style bataati hai uske bheetar bhi kai varg hai, jo shaayad ram jitani hi aasthaa dusron main rakhte hai
 When Hindutva politics puts extra emphasis on Rama, it also shortens Rama and creates a kind of inferiority within many other traditions, such as Shaivite Buddhist Jainism
 ram bhi ek nahin hai
 Rama of Tulsi is different and Rama of Kabir is different
 kabir khud ko ram kii lugaai bataate hai
 Gandhi's Ram is also different
 lekin bijepi ke ram in sab raamon se alag hai
 He is extra aggressive and his devotees are seen trying to overthrow Krishna, Shiva, Durga, Kali all for him
 hindutv kii sundarataa or shakti is bahultavaadi parampara main hi nihit he
 This ocean is made up of so many drops that different waves of cultures came in different periods and kept making their place within them
 jaahir he is parampara main bahut sari keech bhi chali ai, jise ham apane aalochanatmak vivek se dur kar sakate hai karte rahe hai
 But this beauty and power has been eroded most of these years, when devotees like Sadhvi Jyoti are absorbed in both Ram and Hindutva
 ye ram ko ek desh−yaa bharat− tak simit karke unhen bhi chota karte hai
 The truth is that even outside India, there are many societies and countries where the memory of Rama is very rich and those who consider themselves part of the tradition of Rama, see themselves as their psyche children
 sadhvi jyoti jaisi netriyaan jab ram or bharat ko jod detii hai, ek se judane kii shart ko duusare main hone kii paatrata bana detii hai to achaanak ram bhi chota ho jaataa he or desh bhi
 Because this country is also made up of not one but many traditions
 isamen bhi vaishnav, shaiva, shakt, sanatani, buddha, jain, muslim, parsi, isai or na jane kitni paramparaon kii smriti maujuud he
 These traditions also collide and become each other's strengths
 azaadi kii ladaai main ye sari paramparaayen saath ain to ek vishaal bharat bana jisane apni nihatthi aasthaa se angrezon ko baahar kar diya
 If the Muslim League stands on one end of the communalism that has broken and divided this vast India, then on the other side the Sangh Parivar and other related organizations who want to bind the nation in the narrow definition of religion
 ve hindutv kii udaar kathaon kaa bhi apni ochhi raajnneeti ke liye kis tarah istemaal karnaa chaahate hai ye centre sarkaar ke ek or mantri giriraaj singh kaa bayaan bataata he, jisamen unhone modi ko ram or kejariwal ko marich bataaya he
 These ministers will withdraw their language, but will change their mindset too? tyohaari mausam ke dauraan sthaneey bazaaron main nakli note khapaane kii sajeesh naakaam karne kaa daawa karte hue police ne ek taskar ko giraftaar kiya
 Fake notes worth more than Rs 1 lakh were recovered from his possession
 police adheekshak shrinivas verma ne bataaya ki giraftaar aaropee kii pahchaan shivendra bhaati urf banty ke rup main hui he
 On the information of the informer, the crime branch of the police caught him by laying a trap in the LIG intersection area
 verma ne bataaya ki bhaati ke kabje se ek lakh paanch hajaar rupee kii nakli bhartiya mudra baraamad kii gayi, jo ek hajaar or sau rupee ke noton kii shakl main he
 He said that during the police campaign, Bhati's partner Naresh Panwar escaped from the spot, which is being searched
 verma ke mutabik panvar ko varsh 2005 main nakli note ke maamle main giraftaar kiya gaya tha or vah jail se chhootane ke baad phir isi avaidh kaarobaar main lag gaya
 Officials said that police suspect that the wire of the two accused in the fake currency case belonged to a large interstate gang
 unhone bataaya ki bhaati se shuruuaati poochtacha main pataa chalaa he ki yah giroh maharashtra se nakli note lekar aata he or bazaaron main ab tak dhai lakh rupee kii jaali bhartiya mudra chalaa chukaa he

 That day at the Film and TV Institute, i found myself doing all the things i usually do in places like this: finding new movies that students have recently 'downloaded' from somewhere or Then copied it
 jaahir he, badale main jo bhi filmein mere paas hongi, vah main unhen duungaa
 This time around 40 GB Japanese films came to my collection, the most controversial of which was the Suicide Circle series by Japanese filmmaker Seon Sono
 badale main maine china kii chhathi peedi ke filmkaar wang jiyaoshuai kii mahatvapurn filmein deen, jinamein unki haal hi main bahucharchit film frozen or so close tu paradise (jise girl from vietnam naam se bhi janaa jaataa he) bhi thi
 Wang's official entry to India was at the Kolkata International Film Festival in November last year, with his film XI Flowers being awarded the NETPAC Award
 haalanki wang isse kaaphi pehle se yuva film nirmaataaon or cinema premiyon main 2001 kii clasik film beijing bisical ke kaaran khaasi pahchaan bana chuke the
 Earlier, Kim Ki-duk and Jia Zhangke also became well-known for their films, long before they officially entered India, due to their films considered a classic on the high disc circuit
 yah khyaati film paathyakramon se jude chaatro ke utsaah or apane liye nae ustad khojane kii lalak kaa hi nateeja thi
 They not only discovered them but also shared among themselves
 kai maukon par cinema premiyon ne wang jiyaoshuai kii filmon ko aupchaarik taur par saheja, jamkar saajha kiya or online media par apni khub pratikriyaayein deen
 Due to this, the reach of these films increased and they got a chance to go to the film festivals and show
 pichley saal, dilli main nae rang-rup main yojit hue osion film festival main ek bebaak programing kavayad ko anjaam diya gaya
 Film expert Kaushik Bhowmik showed an overview of the Japanese 'pink film as well as Anurag Kashyap (gangs of Wasseypur, Part Two) and Rituparno Ghosh's Chitrangada and then Pasolini's Chokhi Films (eg: Salo: 120 Days of Sodom)
 yah sab kuch film itihaas par baat karne ke liye
 And i think it was a really new experiment in terms of film programming
 osion baat ko or aage badhaane ke liye filmmekar kyuu (unki vivaadaaspad film gandu kii bharat main relies kii ummid abhi dur-dur tak najar nahin aa rahi he lekin yah film ek anaupchaarik circuit to taiyaar kar hi rahi he) ko lekar aayaa or unke band gandu-sarkas ko dilli ke blue frog main aamantrit kiya
 The ceremony concluded with an overview on the work of its motivator and film art pioneer Ustad Mani Kaul
 is baat ko har koi bakhubi jaanata he ki bhartiya cinema kii lagbhag sabhi bhashaaon main ek nai urja dekhne ko mil rahi he
 The new eye-opening thing is the global context, keeping in mind that our films are being woven very carefully
 or iske saath hi, ek nayaa iko-system viksit ho rahaa he
 It is logical that new locations to showcase the film are now being built, ranging from art galleries to cafes to countless informal destinations, which i would call the new circuit of curation, performance and exhibition
 yah kai jeevant vidhaon / kalaon or installation vagairah ko ek saath laati he taaki chalati-phirti chhaviyon ko dekhne ke anubhav ko ek nai paribhaasha mili
 It was unthinkable even a decade ago when a man like Mani Kaul struggled with power apathy, an extremely low budget and almost impossible distribution
 aaj kaul ke chaatr gurvinder singh ne unhen apni pehali or anokhi film anhe ghode da daan samarpit kii he, yah punjabi film he jisamen bathinda ke paas ke ek gaanv ke choubees ghante kaa jindginama he
 The film is produced by the National Film Development Corporation (NFDC) and will be known to non-professional professional actors
 koi bhi ban saktaa he filmon kaa divancedhiktar logon ke liye nae cinema kaa janaa-pahachaanaa cheharaa filmkaar or produsar anuraag kashyap hai
 Anurag has also produced Q's film Tasher Desh in Bangla, Marathi filmmaker Sachin Kundalkar's Ayya and Bedabrata Paine's Chittagong
 ve kaul kii agali film bhi produs karte lekin kaul ke nidhan kii vajah se aisa nahin ho sakaa
 So now they are doing a documentary production on Kaul
 kai logon ko anuraag kaa is nae spes kaa istemaal avasarwaad lag saktaa he
 However, his selection of people for help (eg Vikramaditya Motwani) and films in different languages and contexts illustrate how old-fashioned film production can be linked to new-style curation
 sudhir mishra, kundan shah, jaahnu barua or rituparno ghosh jaise nirdeshkon kii, gyaarah choti-choti kahaniyon vaali anuraag kii film mumbai kating bilkul usee tarah he jaise kisi film student kii hard discs
 It involves sharing all kinds of films with friends and online unknown cinema lovers and sometimes turning it into a filmmaking practice
 hamaare liye donon hi sheliyaan jami-jamaai hai or peeche mudakar ham yah andaaj laga sakate hai ki ab kis tarah kii filmein or filmi itihaas ban saktaa he
 There is a clear trend to be seen - first, movies are watched and collected
 aisa nahin lagata ki bhartiya cinema ko agle sau saal ke liye archive kii jarurat he
 a 1 TB disc of any student of the film can do this job well
 is sab se jis tarah ke film nirmaan kii kala saamne aa rahi he use paribhaashit karnaa thodaa mushkil kaam he, lekin is baat ko samajhane ke paryaapt sanket hai ki kya chal rahaa he
 Here are some suggestions
 kadavi hakeekat par jor vaaki chalan main he: aaj ke daur kii dher sari filmon main vasepur ne isaki shuruyaat kii he
 Earlier, in the 1980s and 90s, Mumbai gangsters used to make films only
 kah sakate hai ki yah vaastaviktaa kaa mark-tu he
 It has changed all cinematic realism since independence
 masalan yahi dekhie na ki isane gaanv or shahar ke fark ke rup main dikhaae jane vaale duusare yatharthwaad ke fark ko paat diya he
 Kashyap's Wasseypur is in between these two, a place that once used to be between Mumbai and Bihar
 is tarah kaa yatharthwaad puri tarah se nae soundscape par nirbhar karata he: ek str par sinc sound najar aata he, lekin duusare par sound kaa istemaal is tarah hota he ki use aaj sneha khanvilakar kii soundtripping main paa sakate hai
 It is produced with a location sound and a little tampering
 yani khaas tarah kaa sangeet jise maukey ke hisaab se piroyaa jaataa he
 We have never seen this before? You cannot explain the style of filmmaking today until you understand the style of the past: all the tongues of the film are thick
 yani baatcheet kaa aisa gahan muhaavara jise aasaani se paribhaashit nahin kar sakate
 First of all, you have to sit down with a dictionary so that you can know the methods of films from a century old
 phir yah rimek kaa jamaana he: sahab, bibi or gangster kaa daur, bollywood kaa vah daur jise samajhnaa bhi sahaj nahin he
 For example, Om Shanti Om, provided you know films of the seventies
 mere liye sabase dilachasp cinema ko nae rup-rang main pesh karnaa he
 My latest experience is the 2010 Bengali film Autograph by Srjit Mukherjee
 isamen abhinayta prasenjit superstar kii bhoomika main hai, jo sathyajith re kii fictional rimek nayak main kaam kar rahe hai or abhinayta uttam kumaar kaa role kar rahe hai
 Not only the film, a third trend in the films based on very few realities is the texture of the characters
 mujhe lagata he ki aadan-pradaan vaala cinema aage bad rahaa he or paraspar samvaad ke rup main tabdeel hone kii koshish kar rahaa he
 In this way we have a long queue of characters and the freedom to move from one character to another
 is tarah cinema bad rahaa he
 This is the most interesting trend because we feel that telling your story is very important
 lekin bhartiya arthvyavastha ise vyavsaayik drushti se badhaava nahin detii: soni play stesan-3 ke liye bane raa
 One game failure is an example of this
 jarurat to is baat kii he ki rajnikant kii film robo yaa shahrukh khan kii super hero hone kii aakankshaayen jo cinema se bhi aage jaati hai— yani cinema ke darshak ko shishe ke us pinjre main le jaati hai, jisamen hero fanse hai
 So take an initiative that is bigger than these stars
 yah ek koshish he, jo bhartiya cinema ko aise daur main le ja rahi he, jiske liye na to bazaar taiyaar he or na hi technic
 All this is not new to the Indian cinema, which has always done its work without any market support
 
 
 antar sirf yahi he ki darshak nai hard discs ke jariye cinema se zyada jud rahe hai

 a big company making a national highway in UP has written a written complaint to the police that BJP MP from Bahraich Savitri Bai Phule is seeking commission from them, which they gave false FIR against the officer of the company for not giving it
 saansad kaa aarope he ki afasar ne unke 150 samarthakon ke saamne unhen gaaliyaan deen or jaan se maarane kii dhamkee bhi di
 Police say that it is not possible that someone abuses the MP in front of hundreds of supporters
 savitri bai phule haive banane waalon se beintahaa naaraaz hai
 He says that he was abused by the project manager, angry with his investigation
 unhone bataaya, mere saath badasluki bhi kii, apshabdon kaa prayog bhi kiya, jati suchak gaali bhi diya
 ' saansad sahiba se jab dobaaraa poocha gaya ki kya hua tha, tab tak vah apana pehla bayaan shaayad bhul chukin thim, isliye is baar kaha ki uski himmat nahin he ki unhen gaali de
 On asking again, he said, used only the words, he does not have the courage to abuse
 ' a 150 km long national highway is being built from Barabanki to the Nepal border of Bahraich in UP
 iskaa 50 kilometre hissaa bhopal kii ek badi company bana rahi he
 According to PWD, she has covered 45 km so far
 uskaa kaam bahut acha he lekin uski badanasibi he ki uski sadak kaa 3 kilometre hissaa saansad savitri bai phule ke ilaake main aata he
 The project manager of the company has reported to the police, 'the mps ask for a commission, saying that they are doing such a big job in our area but do not meet us, they called us to feed the post bungalow
 maine unke or unke 20 samarthakon ke khaane kaa bill diya
 The MP then dug a pit in the middle of the road in the name of investigation
 maine kaha ki sadak kharaab ho jaaegi, kinare khod lijie
 
 
 So angry, he abused and threatened to get the crowd killed
 ' Project Manager Bhagwat Mishra told, Madam told us two or three times that you are doing such a big job, coming from outside and do not come to meet
 hamaare kshetra main kaam kar rahe hai or ham saansad hai, aapako pataa nahin he ham aapaki road ukhdva sakate hai
 ' saansad kii shikaayat par project manager ke khilaaf exiaar likh lee gai he
 But the police are not sure about the mp's point
 tippaniyan Anurak Kumar, Circle Officer of Bahraich said, 'I told him to file an indictment based on the right facts because this incident is not possible in the face of an honorable MP and so many supporters
 is tarah kii ghatnaon se acha kaam karanevaalon kaa manobal tuutata he or saansad or unki party kii chhavi ko bhi dhakka pahunchataa he
 Savitri Bai Phule is extremely angry with the highwaymen
 unka kahana he ki unki jaanch se naaraaz project manager ne unhen gaaliyaan deen
 He told me, he also misbehaved with me, used inaccuracies, abused caste indicators
 ' When MP Sahiba was asked again what had happened, she had probably forgotten her first statement, so this time she said that she did not have the capacity to abuse him
 dobaaraa poochne par unhone kaha, apshabdon kaa hi prayog kiya, gaali dene kii to uski himmat nahin he
 ' upi main barabanki se baharich ke nepal border tak 150 kilometre lanbaa neshnal haive ban rahaa he
 50 km of it is being built by a big company in Bhopal
 peedblyoody ke mutabik vah ab tak 45 kilometre bana chuki he
 His work is very good but he is unfortunate that 3 km of his road falls in the area of MP Savitri Bai Phule
 company ke project manager ne police main report kii he, 'saansad kamishan maangati hai, kahati hai ki hamaare ilaake main itnaa bada kaam kar rahe ho lekin hamase milte nahin, hamen dak bangale bulaakaar khaanaa khilaane kaha
 i billed him and 20 of his supporters food
 phir saansad ne jaanch ke naam par sadak ke bich main gaddha khudva diya
 i said that the road will be bad, dig the shore
 
 
 to naaraaz hokar gandi gaaliyaan deen or bheed se marava daalane kii dhamkee di
 ' project manager bhagwat mishra ne bataaya, madam ne do-teen baar hamako ye bolaa ki aap itnaa bada kaam kar rahe hai, baahar se aae hue hai or milane nahin aate
 We are working in our area and we are mps, you do not know we can uproot your road
 ' On the complaint of the MP, an FIR has been written against the project manager
 lekin police ko saansad kii baat par yakeen nahin he

 haalanki kinhin kaarnon se america use pasand karata tha, or vastav main hamamen se bahuton ke liye yahi is baat kaa shuruaati sanket tha ki pakistan ke bare main ham jo jaanate hai, vahaan usase bhi zyada kuch he
 How did it happen that Mithun Chakraborty, Madhuri Dixit and Kapil Dev's country India stories, which was completely good and complete in every way, were better than the USSR, a Soviet country with serious books of science, science and spacecraft, rather than a country with Rambo r Mister t Was a friend? Is the world not a victim of duplicity like we used to think? The Indian media too entered our teens with us and suddenly the world became more complicated
 seemaa paar ke jo log the ve log ban gaye, ve sirf sani deol kii handpump hinsa ke shikaar nahin bane
 Kargil happened and we did not celebrate, people were killed and nobody won
 or yah bhaavana ghar karne lagi ki yah takaraav jo hamaare janm lene se pehle hi shuru ho chukaa tha hamaare jivan main nahin khatm hone vaala
 Governments have come and gone, both countries have suffered and both countries have moved forward
 hamaara media jabardast raftaar se badla he
 Suddenly, the journalist is no longer an expert in giving rough statistics, a strict image
 vah bhi insaan ban gaya-aisa aadmi jise ham jaanate hai, jinhen ham sweekaar karte hai, aadmi jinase ham nafrat yaa prem karte hai, celibrities, vichaarak, sex simbel, nai arthvyavastha kii hadabadi main duniya zyada khuli dikhne lagi
 Our voice intensified, our spine was stretched and our skin became thick
 ham atmamugdh bhi hue or khud kii aalochana karnaa bhi siikhaa
 New voices, new languages, new ideas started coming into the mainstream: our choice was not determined by anyone else, and we were going ahead and deciding what we liked for ourselves
 hamane bharat ko paribhaashit karne kii koshishon ko chhod diya tha or hamane bharat se apekshaayen kerani shuru kar deen
 We have matured
 or yah hameshaa ek niraashajanak baat rahi he
 The main objective of the Indian media is to sell it to the Indian consumer
 jab pakistani media ne bhartiya media ko ati-rashtravaadi, sarkaar kaa chaapluus or jhootha bataaya, jaisaa 2008 ke hamale ke baad bhartiya media ne kiya, tab vah ek baat samajhane se chook gaya
 Indian media is not a tool of the Government of India
 yah kuch logon kaa samooh he jo apni roji-roti chalaanaa chaahate hai
 And if hate sells, then they will sell hate
 lekin shaantikaal main uttejk rock band or tej gendbaaj hi unke liye khabar honge
 The story of India sells among Indians
 or is vakt ham apni samasyaon se hi ghire hue hai
 We express anger internationally and the only thing that changes is the subject of everyday
 nihsandeh is maanchitr par uthaa-patake karne vaala sabase bada khilaadi bhartiya media hi he
 We have moved forward from studying India through Bharat Manthan and have moved towards India crying with rise
 jahaan tak mujhe yaad he, radiyaget se assam main ek akeli ladki par ek jaan-bujhkar uksaai gai bheed kaa daraavna hamalaa hone ke bich main bhartiya media kii saakh apane nimnatam str par pahunch chuki he
 Along with this, we are also seeing such journalism which is much higher than its predecessor journalism
 jaisaa bharat ke bare main bataane vaali sabase buree rudhokti kahati he ki ham bhartiya doharepan main ustad hai
 It is easy to see why the Indian media is going through a crisis of credibility
 pehla sawaal quality kaa he
 Its irregularities are astonishing
 har acchhee khabar ke baad ek aisi khabar aati he jo sust patrakarita kaa bura udhaaharan hoti he
 The worst is the open trend of paid news
 ek aisi bhartiya avadharana jisamen besharm bhartiya media santhaan apni sevaayen corrporates ke haathon bech dete hai
 And it did not just stain those who run paid news, but the entire Indian media has become tainted by it
 yah samay yah kahkar apana bachaav karne kaa nahin he ki kis tarah yah sab to pashchim main bhi prachlit he
 But, if we look to the west, the tabloids there also maintain consistency in the standard levels of their newspapers
 saamanjasy, tark, vivek or daleelah yah kuch aisi chijen hai jinaki bhartiya media ko sakht darkaar he
 And to achieve this, we need to get inside ourselves
 aise daur main jab marketing or aid cells sampadakon par satat dawaab banaae rakhte hai or kharaab patrakarita zyada logon ko aakarshith karti he, apni khaamiyon ko dekhnaa kaaphi mushkil he
 But this is also the period when everyone is a broadcaster and nobody wants to listen
 ek aisa daur jab pathakon or shrotaaon ke paas vikalp or shakti he
 In such a situation, returning to the foundation and principles of good journalism can save any media institution in this digital age
 media ko tatkaal is baat ko lekar jaagane kii jarurat he varanaa hamaare desh kii kahani or bhi syah ho jaaegi

 ) The new controversy may arise from what President Pranab Mukherjee has said about Sanjay Gandhi in his new book 'the Turbulent Years 1980-1996'
 pranab mukherjee ne apni kitaab main sanjay gandhi kii na sirf joardaar tarif kii he balki unke samay behad vivaadaaspad rahe parivaar niyojan ko bhi unke shandaar kaamon main gina he
 Describing the demolition of Babri Masjid as a very shameful incident, Pranab wrote that it was an incident which shocked the image of India as a tolerant and religious harmony in the world
 unhone likhaa he ki babari vidhwans narsimha raav sarkaar kii sabase badi vifaltaa thi
 Pranab Mukherjee played a very long innings in politics before becoming President
 wo un chand netaaon main se hai jo 22 saal tak kendriya mantri rahe or videsh mantralay, raksha mantralay se lekar vitt mantralay tak kii jimmedaari sanbhali
 So when Vice President Hamid Ansari was releasing his book 'the Turbulent Years 1980-1996' at Rashtrapati Bhavan on Thursday, all eyes were on how many secrets Pranab has uncovered in his book
 haalanki khud unhone kaha ki is malme main wo zyada udaar nahin hai
 Pranab Mukherjee started his book to erase the image of Sanjay's villain from 23 June 1980, the day Sanjay Gandhi died in a plane crash
 sanjay gandhi kii tarif main pranab mukherjee ne vistaar se likhaa he
 After the Emergency, Sanjay Gandhi was presented as a villain and a lot of poison was spewed against him
 lekin sanjay gandhi saaf soch vaale ek bebaak or nidar netaa the
 In the interest of the society, he had created a 5-point program which includes family planning
 narsimha ko sunai thi khari-khotipranab mukherjee ne likhaa he kibabari masjid ko nahin bachaa panapurv pradhanmantri narsimha raav ke jivan kii sabase badi vifaltaa thi
 Pranab Mukherjee, referring to one of his meetings with Narasimha Rao after the demolition of the Babri Masjid, writes, 'I angrily heard him very well and asked if there was anyone who could give you the right advice
 maine poocha ki kya aap iske khataron ke bare main nahin samajhate hai
 i said that at least now you should take some concrete steps to heal the feelings of Muslims

 But looking at his face, he felt sad and disappointed
 'nahin dekha PM banane kaa khwabpranab mukherjee ne mana ki 1986 main congress se nishkashit kiye jane ke baad alag party bananaa unki bhul thi
 Pranab Mukherjee has also strongly denied that he was seeking to become Prime Minister after the assassination of Indira Gandhi

 Rahul Gandhi is currently on a tour of Karnataka
 bangaleru main party netaaon ko sambodhit karte huerahul gandhi kaha ki hamaari sena desh kii raksha karti he
 No party leader should comment against the army and the army chief
 yahi nahin, rahul ne kaha ki sena pramukh ko lekar sandip dikshit kaa bayaan galat tha, or rajanetaaon ko is tarah kaa bayaan dene kii koi jarurat nahin he
 In fact, on Sunday, Congress leader Sandeep Dixit gave a controversial statement about the Army Chief, he described the Army Chief as a 'goonda of the road'
 dikshit ne apane bayaan main kaha tha ki hamaresena pramukhajab 'sadak ke gunde' kii tarah bolte hai, to kharaab lagata he
 After this statement of Dixit, BJP opened the front against him
 grih rajya mantri kiran rigiju ne twit kar kaha ki congress party ke saath ho kya rahaa he? congress army chif ko sadak kaa gunda kaise kah sakati he
 However, shortly after making the statement, Sandeep Dixit apologized for his statement
 unhone kaha, 'main maanata hum ki maine jo kaha he
 He is wrong, so i apologize and retract my statement
 'puri congress or rahul gandhi maafee maange: giriraaj singhkendriya mantri giriraaj singh ne sandip dikshit ke army chif ko lekar die bayaan par tikhi pratikriya vyakt karte hue kaha ki ki sandip dikshit kaa bayaan bahut hi galat he
 The Congress party should apologize for his statement, Rahul Gandhi should apologize
 nitish kumaar ke kisaanon vaale bayaan par giriraaj singh ne aade haathon lete hue kaha ki nitish kumaar ko bolne kaa koi adhikaar nahin he
 Our government has done a lot, not for the farmers
 nitish kumaar kaa hameshaa se hi doharaa charitra rahaa he
 He spoke a lot before the election, he did nothing after the election
 centre se jo paisa aata he kisaanon ke liye, vah bhi kisaanon ke hit ke liye istemaal nahin karte hai

 However, the NCP, the other partner of the ruling coalition in the state, said that by boycotting the vote, the Shiv Sena gave the message that it does not have views like the BJP on controversial aspects of the proposed law
 rajyasabha main vidheyak ke paksh main 125 mat or virodh main 105 mat pade
 Shiv Sena walked out of the House seeking clarification on some issues
 mahajan ne fasebuk post main kaha, 'dukhad, durbhagyapurna
 
 
 Is Sanjay Raut's speech on the bill a sign of Shiv Sena's confusion on this issue or is it an idea to keep all options open? His move to boycott proceedings in the name of clarification is not defensible and it would be naive to assume that the boycott would help the ruling party
 haalanki, rakanpa pravaktaa nawab malik ne kaha, 'unke (shivasena) walkout kaa matlab tha ki vah vidheyak ke mudde par bhaajapa jaise vichaar nahin rakhte hai
 The other NCP leader said on condition of anonymity that even if the Shiv Sena had voted, its three votes would not have benefited the opposition

 Sindhu has managed to make it to the finals of the women's singles category of the World Championship for the second time in a row
 final main aaj unka saamana spain kii carolina marin se hoga
 So far no Indian player has won a gold medal in the World Championship, in such a situation, if Sindhu is successful in winning the gold, she will create history
 chook sudhaarney kaa maukasindhu ne pichley saal bhi is championships ke final main pravesh kiya tha jahaan unhen japan kii nojomi okuharaa se maat khaani padi thi
 At the same time, Marin defeated China's Bingjiao to make it to the final for the third time
 ab ek baar phir sindhu ke saamne is toornament main swarna padak jeetne kaa mauka he, lekin unka saamana us khilaadi se jisase wo rio olympic-2016 ke final main maat kha chuki hai
 It was Marin who stopped Sindhu from winning the first Olympic gold medal two years ago
 marin kaa palada bharidonon ke bich abhi tak kul 11 mukaable hue hai jisamen se chah main marin ko fatah hasil hui he to paanch baar sindhu unhen shikast dene main kaamyaab rahi hai

 The reason for this is the alliance in which the bjp's seat of Rajbhars went to the account of the Bharatiya Samaj Party
 jabaki congress kii seat sapa ke khate main
 In this seat, the independent candidate of BJP, who finished second in the 2012 election, jumped into the fray and the contest has become interesting
 baliya ke bansadih vidhansabha kshetra ke ek gaanv kaa jayja lete vakt kuch log ek badi gaadi main lage screen par film dekhte najar aaye
 On going closer, it was found that Akhilesh's work speaks from the sp's promotional vehicle that the villagers are watching the film
 raat ke andhere main prachaar kaa ye badhiya tarika he jiske jariye sapa apni upasthiti darj kara rahi he
 But in broad daylight, BJP is being discussed here, while no BJP candidate is also in the fray
 lekin purvanchal ke jaateey sameekaran kii goti ko feet karne ke liye bhaajapa ne rajbharon kii kshetreey party bhaasapa se gathbandhan kiya or bansadih vidhansabha kshetra main unke pratyaashee pehali baar chunaav maidan main utre
 The candidates of Bhaspa are not from this region and they are also in the election field for the first time
 jisaki vajah se pahchaan kii ek chunauti saamne he
 But they say that the public will win them
 lekin bhaajapa gathbandhan ke liye ye rasta itnaa aasaan nahin kyonki yahaan 2012 main bhaajapa kii pratyaashee rahi ketki singh party ke tikat kii prabal daavedaar thim
 He is contesting as an independent candidate after Bhaspa's account in the seat alliance
 wo kadi chunauti detii bhi dikhti hai kyonki is ilaake se wo do baar chunaav lard chuki hai, gaanv-gaanv ko jaanati hai jabaki bhaasapa ke pratyaashee is ilaake ke nahin hai
 His opponents are also making this an issue
 nirdaleey pratyaashee ketki singh kahati hai, "wo baahar ke hai, janata ne unhen baahar kaa rasta dikhaa diya he, chunaav ke baad wo baahar hi chale jaaenge
 The comments gauratlab he ki bansadih vidhansabha kshetra main kabhi congress ke kaddavar netaa baccha pathak kaa dabadabaa tha
 He ruled this assembly seat seven times since 1969
 baccha pathak ke baad yahaan ramgovind choudhary kii entry hui
 He won the election here in 2002
 mulaayam mantrimandal main mantri bhi rahe
 Then lost in 2007 
 par 2012 main phir sapa se jite or mantri rahe
 He always kept fighting against the Congress
 is baar bhi congress ke kai daavedaar the par ye seat gathbandhan se unke paas hi rahi
 Bansdih, which is the high profile seat of Ballia, has many veteran leaders in the area, but this area has been struggling with lack of strength
 har saal prakritik aapadaa yahaan kahar barpati he
 Migration is a major problem here during summer and fire days
 jiskaa purasaahaal lene vaala koi nahin
 In such a situation, even without the candidates of big parties, the election is no less interesting

 The Islamist activities on the indo-pak border in Rajasthan have increased in the last few years
 seemaa suraksha bal (biguef) kii ek report main iskaa khulaasa hua he
 'TV Today' reported in the BSF report that the activities in the border areas adjacent to Jaisalmer have increased in recent years which could pose a threat to the security forces
 report ke mutabik, saal 2000 se pehlejaisalmer borderake us paar kattar islamic gatividhiyaan na ke baraabar thim, jabaki ab usamen baari ijapha dekha ja rahaa he
 In the southern part of Jaisalmer, there were no mosques before 2000, while now many mosques have started construction on government land
 kai puraane masjid bhi dekhe ja sakate hai
 According to the report, the activities of Mandla Masjid have been witnessing a boom in recent years
 mandla masjid dakshini jaisalmer se 8 kilometre kii duuri par sthit he
 People from far and wide can be seen in Mandla Mosque
 pir pagaaraa ke anuyaayi na sirf jaisalmer se, balki gujarat ke andruni ilaakon se bhi is masjid main aa rahe hai
 Based on the facts, this report has stated that the population of the Muslim community in this area is increasing at a faster than normal rate
 khaskar sam pokaran or nachna ilaake main aabaadi kaa graph badi teji se badha he
 The southern border areas of Jaisalmer are also seeing significant growth
 jaisalmer seemaa par videshi harakatein kis prakaar chaalu hai iskaa andaja pichley saal kii do ahm ghatnaon se lagaaya ja saktaa he
 In February 2017, Rajasthan Police arrested a detective named Haji Khan from Jaisalmer district
 khan par samvedansheel suchanaaen churaane or pakistan ko supplai karne kaa aarope laga tha
 Khan himself lives in Jaisalmer but his relatives are from Pakistan
 farvari main hi is ghatana se ek hafte pehle sadik naam ke ek sandigdh ko giraftaar kiya tha, jis par pakistan ko suchanaaen bhejne kaa aarope laga tha
 In December 2017, another incident took place in which BSF detained an Afghan citizen and incited several secrets
 kabul nivasee mohammad parvej ne poochtacha main ibi ko bataaya tha ki vah tourist vija par bharat aayaa tha or jaisalmer ke ilaakon main dawaaen bech rahaa tha
 Parvez had also told the IB that two more Afghans had come to India with him, including one detained
 sarahadi ilaakon main aisi gatividhiyaan desh kii aantarik suraksha ke liye khatra ban sakati hai kyonki andhere kaa phayda uthaakar dehshatgard bharat kii seemaa main gadabadi paidaa kar sakate hai
 This is the situation in the border areas of Jammu and Kashmir
 bhartiya seemaa ke us paar haalat yah ho gai he ki charampanthi gut hameshaa gadabad karne kii firaaq main rahete hai
 The terrorists' launching pads are the biggest example of this
 aatanki apane mansoobon main kaamyaab na hon, iske liye bharat ne sargical hamale bhi kiye
 Many terrorists were also killed, but Pakistan sponsored terrorism is still creating disturbances in India

 In preparation for a big movement against NRC, bjp's student wing ABVPABVP is targeting a rival movement in the state against the supplementary list of National Register for Citizens (NRC), Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP)
 ye list 31 agast ko jari kii gai
 The names of more than 19 lakh people are not included in this list
 vahiin ABVP ke assam pradesh sachiv rakesh das kaa daawa he ki rajya kashmir kii tarah ek islamic rajya main badal jayega or jo nuksaan hoga uski bharpai nahin kii ja sakegi
 Das said, 'assam is moving towards becoming an Islamic state
 maujuuda NRC ne yahaan rah rahe bahari logon ko jashn kaa mauka diya he vahiin baaki log jo yahaan ke asal naagarik hai wo shikaayat kar rahe hai
 There are many people whose documents are complete but their names are not in the list
 ye kaise sambhav he jabaki ek dashak pehle kendriya grih mantri ne assam main avaidh apravasiyon kii sankhya 40 lakh se adhik bataai thi
 If this NRC is accepted, it will make Assam an Islamic state like Kashmir
 'system or data suraksha par bolte hue das ne kaha, 'ham supreme court par sawaal nahin uthaa rahe hai, lekin jis tarah is prakriya ko anjaam diya gaya, ham us mudde ko uthaa rahe hai
 There have been major omissions and problems regarding data entry
 'ol assam students union (AASU) assam kaa sabase bada chaatr sanghathan he
 At the same time, it has also been an important side of the Assam Accord
 isaki ore se NRC kii maang ko uthaaya jaataa rahaa
 But recently AASU slowed down its tone by saying that there are flaws in the process and the final figures do not match the expectation
 ABVP ne rajya main pratidwandvi AASU par nishaanaa saadhaa he
 ABVP State Secretary Das said, 'we want to know with whom does AASU stand? They have questioned our credibility
 ab jab NRC avaidh apravasiyon ko phayda pahunchaa rahaa he or yahaan ke mul nagarikon ko nahin
 In such a situation, he is changing his stand
 kah rahe hai ki ye sahi nahin he
 Das made it clear that large protests would be held in the state soon
 logon ko jaagruk kiya jayega jisase sunishchit kiya ja sake log sattarudh party (bijepi) se naaraaz naa hon
 Das said, 'we need to create a movement
 ham chaahate hai ki mul naagarik apni aawaaj uthaaen
 Actually, Moti ur Rehman case number 526 / 10 which is demanding 1951 to be treated as 'cut off year'
 ham bhi iskaa samarthan kar rahe hai
 We want the real picture and justice for the people of Assam who have been fighting for their rights for decades

 Generally, employees consider office as a stressful place
 work pressure or har maheene target puraa karne kii daud kii vajah se kuch karmchaariyon ke chehre par tanaav spasht najar bhi aane lagati he
 But if you want to stay away from tension and stress, then you can be happy in the office by adopting these tips
 
 
 1
 Keep a good relationship with your colleagues in the office
 jaahir he daftar main kuch aise log bhi honge, jinka bihaviour aapako pasand nahin aata hoga, lekin unamem bhi koi khaas baat jarur hogi
 So try to learn the special things of your colleagues and keep the atmosphere friendly
 kyonki offis main kaam kaa tanaav to pehle se hi maujuud hota he, aise main agar vaataavaran main bhi tanaav ho jaae to kaam karnaa boj lagane lagegaa
 Do this one job before going to interview, help will be available in job 2
 ye baat aap samaj len ki jo vyakti kaam karata he, galtiyaan bhi usee se hoti hai
 So, if you have received any negative feedback about the work, then accept it and try to improve instead of fretting over it and yes thank the person
 kyonki aaj ke jamaane main har vyakti duusare kii galatiyon kaa phayda uthaane ke liye taiyaar baitha he
 3
 kaam ko lekar tanaav isliye hota he, kyonki ham usee yojana thik se nahin banaate
 Actually, if you earn with planning, keeping your goals in mind, then neither will you feel stressed nor cumbersome while working
 agar pramotion mila he to aise karen kaam or bane parfect senior4
 Usually we make a mistake of multi tasking in sub office
 multi tasking yani ek saath kai kaam karnaa
 This reduces your speed and you are unable to concentrate on one task
 5
 One way to be happy in the office is to keep yourself ready for new challenges
 agar aapako kisi desk se hataakar doosraa desk yaa section diya ja rahaa he to niraash na hon
 Because there is a possibility of doing better in every region
 aap vahaan bhi apana hunar dikhaa sakate hai

 11 lakh parikshaarthi railway kii pariksha nahin de sake
 11 Lakh What is the smallest number? Out of 47 lakh candidates, 11 lakh could not appear in the examination, this is shameful in every case
 aap jaanate hai ki railway ne agast main 64,037 padon ke liye pariksha lee he
 This exam was for the post of Assistant Loco Pilot and Technician
 rail mantralay ne khud hi twit kar bataaya he ki 76
 Only 76 percent students could appear in the exam
 jab pariksha online ho or 11 lakh noujvaan imtahaan na de saken to phir kis baat kii online pariksha he ye
 This time the examination centers were quite far away
 kai chaatr garibi ke kaaran nahin ja sake to kai isliye nahin de sake ki ek nae shahar main pariksha centre khojate khojate der ho gai
 There may be other reasons for many not giving exams
 aap khud bhi railway ke parikshaarthiyon se pataa kar len
 It is such an intoxication to say that it is superior to the previous government at all times, that even reference is not mentioned properly
 railway ne twit kar diya ki pichhali baar jab sahaayak loko payalat or technician kii pariksha hui thi tab 32 lakh naujavaanon ne farm bharaa tha
 This examination took place four years ago
 tab 16
 8 lakh students could not provide
 rail mantralay yah kahana chahta he ki is baar 11 lakh hi nahin de sake
 Was there an online exam four years ago? indian express ke kariyar desk ne twit ke aadhaar par yah khabar likhi he
 It contains information that is even more terrible
 akhbaar ne likhaa he ki sahaayak loko payalat or technician ke liye 48 lakh aavedan aae the
 Out of this, one lakh 33 thousand farms were rejected
 iskaa matlab to yahi hua na ki 47 lakh se kuch kam chaatro kaa farm sweekaar kiya gaya
 Out of this, 11 lakh youth could not go for the examination due to different reasons
 ye kisi online pariksha he jise dene ke liye ofline yatra kerani padati he
 That too 500 to 2000 km
 aap rail mantri ke twitor kii timeline par jaaiye

 When the form was taken out by the Railways, 500 rupees were taken as fees for filling the form
 jab prime time main is sawaal ko uthaaya or naujavaanon ne bhi yah baat eemaandaaree se rakhi ki iees ke imtahaan ke liye 100 rupee kaa farm or group si or di ke imtahaan kaa farm 500 rupee main tab rail mantri ne elaan kiya tha ki 400 rupee lautaa die jaaenge
 Only 100 rupees have to be paid for the form

 i have no hope from the youth who are afraid to comment on my post, but by what right do these youths who send themselves and see everything ruin, send me a message that i am the only hope
 main unka pyaar or sammaan samajhataa hum, kadra bhi karata hum magar jab tak ve yah nahin dekhenge ki unka india kab se bujdil india ho gaya jahaan sawaal poochne par ankaron ko hatwa diya jaataa he, tab tak ve kaise ummid karte hai ki koi unki baat uthaane kii himmat karegaa

 rio olympic se bharat ke liye ek behad hi buree khabar ai he
 Indian wrestler Narsingh Yadav has been banned for four years for doping
 iske saath hi pahalwaan narsingh rio olympic main hissaa nahin le paaenge
 Narasimha expressed displeasure towards this and said that just 12 hours before the game, his dream of winning gold for the country was taken away from him
 mere paas ab yahi ladaai baaki he: narsinghis puure maamle main narsingh yadav ne kaha, 'beete do maheenon main maine bahut kuch saha he
 But during this time, the only thing on my mind was to fight for the honor of the country
 rio main desh ke liye medal jeetne ke mere sapane ko khel se 12 ghante pehle mujhase nirdayatapurvak chhina gaya
 But i will do everything that can prove me innocent
 ab mere paas ladane ke liye yahi bachaa he
 'let us tell you that after a four-hour-long debate by a court of the Brazilian CAS (court of Orbitration for Sports), it was ruled that Narasimha was banned
 pahalwaan narsingh yadav par laga chaar saal kaa bincchhash ne nadaa ke faisle ko maanane se inkaar kar diya
 They ruled that adulteration in their food or drink was not right
 adaalat ne narsingh ke us tark ko bhi maanane se inkaar kar diya kaium unke saath sajeesh hui he
 Because there is no evidence of Narasimha Yadav to prove it
 isi tark ko dekhte hue nadaa ne unhen olympic main hissaa lene kii anumati di thi
 Today Narasimha was to get on the field, Friday was going to be very important for Indian wrestler Narasimha Yadav
 is din ke liye pichley kai saalon se mehnat kar rahe the
 In the Rio Olympics, he was to compete in the wrestling 74 kg category
 lekin is faisle ke saath hi unke saare armaan dhare ke dhare rahe gaye
 Cass has banned Narasimha for four years
 ab narsingh ko aaj hone vaale pehle match se pehle hi olympic khelgaumv chhodana hoga
 The Sports Tribunal could not believe that the conspiracy had taken place
 Meanwhile, the Wrestling Federation of India has admitted that it could not convince the Sports Tribunal that wrestler Narasimha Yadav was a victim of the conspiracy and that is why the decision did not go in its favor
 Which led to a four-year ban, with the Rio Olympics out
 dablyooefai adhyaksh brijbhushan sharan singh ne kaha ki khel panchat kii samiti yah jaanane par adi thi ki yadi koi sajeesh hui he to gunahagaar ko abhi tak sajaa kyon nahin mili

 wada ne apni apil main narsingh ko rashtriya doping nirodhi agency (nadaa) dwaara clin chit die jane ko galat qaraar diya tha
 CAS has accepted Wada's appeal, Narasimha's future seems bleak
 vah ab rio olympic main hissaa nahin le paaenge
 Brijbhushan said, 'this incident should not happen to any player in future
 main is puure mudde main sibiai jaanch kii maang karata hum, taaki bhavishya main yah maamla na doharaaya jaae

 But how much attention needs to be paid to the betterment of army personnel or the military mobilization, Aaj Tak Webb gave special talks on issues like ceasefire violations by Pakistan, India connection of ISIS and role of army in Kashmir
 From PK Sehgal, who was a Major General in the army
 saal 2002 main ritair hue major general pike sahagal sena ke kai ucch padon par apni sevaayen de chuke hai
 Sehgal has been the head of Army Defense College
 sahagal kareeb sena ke teen hajaar javaanon ko army college main vishesh training de chuke hai
 At the same time, Sehgal has also served in the National Defense Academy, Kharagwasla
 sahagal bhartiya sena ke air dephence brigade kii kaman bhi sambhaal chuke hai
 Major General PK Sehgal played a special role even during the Kargil War
 haalanki ritairement ke baad sahagal saamaajik kaaryon se jude hai lekin bhartiya sena or raksha tantra main unki vishesh jaankaree ko bharat sarkaar aaj bhi upyog main laati he
 Read the highlights of the conversation with Major General PK Sehgal: What concrete steps should the Indian government take to prevent ceasefire violations from Pakistan? See, what is happening from Pakistan, their government Is a failure puri duniya jaanati he ki pakistan main kiski hukumat chalati he
 There, that is what ISI, Pakistani army and terrorist organizations want
 bharat sarkaar ko pakistan par dwipaksheeya vaarta ke liye dabaav bananaa chahie
 War is not the only option, this issue cannot be resolved without negotiation
 bharat sarkaar pakistan par dabaav banane kaa har sambhav prayaas kar rahi he
 As far as the Army is concerned, Pakistan is being given a brick response to Pakistan by the army
 pakistan ke pradhanmantri navaj sharif kashmir ke mudde ko baar-baar antarrashtriya patal par rakhane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 In such a situation, what should be India's stand? Whatever Nawaz Sharif is doing, he is doing under the pressure of ISI
 navaj narendra modi ke shapathgrahan samaaroh main shaamil hone aae the us vakt aisa lag rahaa tha ki sab kuch thik he lekin bharat aane par pakistan main navaj sharif kii bahut ninda hui
 In such a situation, the pressure of ISI on Nawaz Sharif has increased
 chaahe pakistan kisi bhi patal paa jaakar kashmir raag alaape lekin is baat se koi inkaar nahin kar saktaa ki kashmir bharat kaa abhinn ang he or is samasya ko sirf bharat or pakistan aapas main baatcheet se hi sulajhaa sakate hai
 India does not need the US and UN mediation on this issue at all
 pakistan kaa newclear power hona or pakistan ko china se mil rahi madad bharat ke liye kitni khatarnaak he?bharat ko kisi tarah kaa koi dar nahin he
 No issue can be resolved by fighting
 agar pakistan ye sochataa he ki uske newclear power hone se bharat dar rahaa he to wo uski galatfahami he
 Pakistan will have to talk to India
 or jahaan tak china kaa sawaal he to ye sach he ki china lagaataar pakistan ko parde ke peeche se madad kar rahaa he
 But India has spoken to China on this issue and efforts are underway to pressurize it
 pakistan se sambadh sudhaar kii kitni ummiden hai?dekhie hamen hameshaa positive sochna chahie
 Our relationship with Pakistan will definitely improve within the next 10 years
 kyonki pakistan main bhi kai tarah kii samasyaayein hai jinase wo lagaataar jujh rahaa he
 In such a situation, India is a country which can help him
 mujhe lagata he ye baat pakistan ko jald samaj main aa jaaegi or wo bharat ke saath rishte sudhaarney kii koshish jarur karegaa
 How big a threat is ISIS to the country? i do not consider ISIS a major threat
 aaj desh main majboot sarkaar he
 Our land, sea and air borders are safer than before
 ham lagaataar apane eksternal or internal intelligence ko or bhi majboot karne ke liye prayasarat hai
 We are ready to answer the same to ISIS
 hamaari sena or intelligence iske liye kitni taiyaar he?dekhie sabase pehle main ye khule taur par kahana chaahunga ki pichhali UPA sarkaar ne hamaari sena, eksternal intelligence or internal intelligence ko or bhi behtareen banane par koi kaam nahin kiya he
 In the last 10 years, many shortcomings in the army could be overcome, but the UPA government did not pay attention to this
 pichhali sarkaar ne naa to sena or intelligence ke mordenigeshan par dhyaan diya or naa hi sena ke javaanon kii behatari ke liye koi kadam uthaae
 But in spite of all this, the army and intelligence have done their job well and are ready to deal with any situation
 haalanki, main ye bataa duun ki sena ko nai sarkaar se dheron ummiden hai
 For now, there is a need to improve the army and intelligence
 sena ko mordenigeshan kii jarurat he
 Narendra Modi has repeatedly spoken of strengthening the army and it is expected that he will work on it soon
 jammu-kashmir main sena kii bhoomika par aksar sawaal uthaae jate hai
 The Kashmiris complain that the military's attitude is not good towards them
 aise main sena ke liye kitna mushkil hota he vahaan ke logon ke bich vishwaas banaae rakhana?kashmiri log bahut achche hai
 His relationship with the military is also very good
 haa, kuch asaamaajik tatv hai jo pareshaani khadi karne ke liye kuch naa kuch karte rahete hai
 The army also runs campaigns with the locals there
 ab kashmir ke logon ko bhi samaj aane laga he ki unhen ab tak bevakoof banaaya ja rahaa tha
 The Indian Army which has shown its activeness in saving people in the recent floods is truly worthy
 is baat kaa kashmiriyon par acha asar padaa he or bhartiya sena ke prati unki soch main badlaav aayaa he
 You talked to us on many important issues related to National Security and Army, thank you for that

 tejasvi yadav ne ek fasebuk post ke jariye nitish kumaar sarkaar par talkh tippanee kii he
 Tejaswi wrote, 'bihar's poor law and order has now reached a moribund state
 police kaa kaam bas sarkari aakaaon kii raajnneeti ko pankh dene, unke ishaare par naachne, brajesh thakur jaise balaatkaariyon, qaatilon or maffiaon kaa sangrakshan dene kaa hi rah gaya he
 In Bihar, murder, kidnapping, rape, extortion, extortion and all manner of black exploits are flourishing under the protection of power
 is bhayaavah maahaul main aam aadmi saham saham kar apni jaan bachaate guzar basar karne ko vivash he
 'tejashwi further wrote,' a day before in Chhapra a constable and a havildar were secretly surrounded by unarmed criminals in a public beach and roasted with bullets

 In the past years, many officers of Bihar Police have been killed by criminals

 Today, incidents of murder, kidnapping, gang rape, robbery and rape have become so high in the state that it is now common news for newspapers which are no longer considered sensational
 jelon se hi apradhi aparaadh jagat ko control or manage kar rahe hai
 Sim, mobile, weapons are being found in bulk in jails

 Kalpana Singh, former Queen of Kota, who went on election campaign, entered a poor man's house and started making roti by sitting near his stove

 When Kalpana Singh was questioned, she said that once it is late to win the election, after that everyone will have to cook food on the gas stove
 netaa kahin roti senk rahe hai to kai mahilaon ke bich dance kar rahe hai
 Similarly, Younus Khan, who contested on the BJP ticket from Tonk against Sachin Pilot, is also making bread by entering the hut to prove himself poor during the election campaign
 younus khan kehete hai ki vah apni garibi main aataa bhi goonthte the or roti bhi banaate the

 The slogans and demonstrations against the poor condition of the college campus are met in Delhi Mumbai itself, the student politics in the colleges outside the metropolis has died down, due to which there is neither the struggle of the students nor their Assertiveness in voice
 bahut kam chaatr mili jo khulkar uniwarsity kii samasya ko saamne rakh sake, unhen yah to pataa he ki teacher nahin he magar yah kahana nahin aayaa ki isse ve kis tarah barbaad ho rahe hai, jivan main peeche chhot rahe hai
 Except for the performance of the students of Sampurnanand Sanskrit University in Banaras, students everywhere were seen speaking the same sentences as their principals, the way their housemates, the chamol
 duusari taraf mumbai universti ke chaatro ke andolan main zid dikhi, naare sunai die or tevar bhi
 The performance of students of Sampurnanand Sanskrit University in Banaras does not reveal whether they are performing rituals or committing democracy
 School of Planning and Architecture main chaatro kii narebaazi 26 oktober kii subah 9 baje se chal rahi he
 They shouted slogans outside the campus all night
 jin maangon ko lekar pradarshan kar rahe the, unhen dekhakar dilli se baahar ke chaatr yahi soch rahe honge ki inase zyaada samasya to hamaare yahaan hai magar ham log to edjust kar gaye hai, ye kyon hai hai kar rahe hai
 Actually, our political and social values seem to have gone away
 ab ham fasebuk par hi bolne ko bolnaa samajhate hai, athurity yaa prashasan ke saamne kuch zyaada hi chup rahane lage hai
 This fire is the cause of this movement of SPA
 26 oktober kii subah 5 baje ke kareeb campus ke girls hostel main shot circuit se aag lag gai
 At the time of the fire, there was no girl in the room
 aag ke kaaran kamare kaa sara saamaan jal kar raakh ho gaya
 The two girls living in this room are from Iraq whose passport is also burnt
 inkaa kahana he ki chah lakh tak ke saamaan jal gaye
 The fan broke down and came down
 ganimat he ki us vakt kamare main koi nahin tha, varanaa agar teenon ladkiyaan yahaan hoti to kuch bhi ho saktaa tha
 This incident of fire exposed the security of the hostel
 guard ko aag bujhane ke silendar kaa istemaal karnaa nahin aata tha or chaatraon ko bhi training nahin di gai thi ki aag lagane par kya karnaa he
 SPA was formed in 1941
 yah desh kaa sabase purana or pratishthit santhaan he jahaan planning or architect kii padhai hoti he
 This college was established so that the students coming out of it will help in planning in the village, city and other areas
 kasbon kii planning kaa haal dekhakar aap nishcint ho sakate hai ki bharat main kabhi kisi ne architect or planning kii kabhi padhai hi nahin kii he
 In 2015, it was declared as an institution of national importance by passing legislation by the Parliament
 rashtriya mahatv ke is santhaan ke chaatr andolan ke mahatv ko bhi samajhate hai
 If you did not protest or participate in democracy, or did not join, then you did not live democracy
 haath main binar lekar chalanaa loktantr kaa sabase kuubasurat drishy he
 Without such scenes neither you become a citizen nor a human being
 binar par likhe ye shabd sirf naare nahin hai balki kavita hai
 By picking this up, when you are coming out of the class room to gather in a courtyard on the campus of the college, then you are freed from your inner fear and have prepared to pay the duty of speaking
 bolnaa khud ko behatar karnaa he
 These students of SPA have gathered here for the safety of fire
 samooh kii yah takat hi he jo prashasan ko vinamr banaati he
 After ignoring the first day, when the agitation went on the second day, the Dean of the college appeared
 chaatr dean se sawaal jawaab karne lage hai
 If you did not question, what did you live? espie dimd uniwarsity he
 1200 students study
 phir bhi yahaan ke hostel kii samasyaon kii suchi kaaphi lambii he
 One student said that water does not come clean in the hostel, due to which students buy bottles of water from outside
 ek chaatr pani par hazaar se pandrah sau rupee karch karata he
 The ceiling keeps falling apart
 chaatr bataate hai ki yahaan saanp bhi aate hai
 Monkeys and rats keep coming
 andolan karne vaale chaatro ne college kaa puraa bajet chaan maaraa he
 The notice board has been installed
 yah santhaan praathamikta suchi main hone ke baad bhi bajet kii katautee kaa saamana kar rahaa he
 In 2013-14, the budget provision of SPA was 45 crores but got 28 crores
 2014-15 main espie kaa bajet praavdhaan tha 46 karod magar mila 30 karod
 In 2015-16, the budget provision of SPA was 40 crores but got 26 crores
 aap dekh rahe hai ki kis tarah bajet kam mil rahaa he
 This is affecting the basic facilities here
 college main doctor hona chahie magar nahin he
 Medication is also not available
 girls hostel main ek floor par aath hi shauchalay hai jabaki saath chatraayen rahati hai
 According to him this is quite low
 espie ke chaatro ne bataaya ki safai kaa bura haal he
 During the movement, he cleaned and deposited this waste
 chaatro kaa kahana he ki campus main machharon kaa raaj he jisaki vajah se kai chaatro ko dengue ho chukaa he
 The junk of the old cooler is stored here
 vaise aap dilli ke mohallon main jaaiye puraani gaadiyaan or scooter kabad ke rup main jame hue hai
 There is no removal
 campus kaa haal bhi kuch aisa hi he
 SPA is deemed university
 yahaan bhi jitne shikshak hone chahie utane nahin hai
 Statistics show that there are fewer teachers than the sanctioned posts and the number of teachers is decreasing
 2014 main professor ke liye 32 pad manzur hai, 29 professor the
 From 2014 to 2016, this number decreased from 29 to 23
 2014 main associat professor ke 44 pad manzur the magar kaam kar rahe the 30
 There were 30 associate professors in 2014 and 31 in 2016, a decrease of 13
 skool of planning and architector main bhi shikshakon kii kami he
 Now let's go to Rajasthan
 yahaan ke system main ek shabd kaa istamaal hota he, kaary vyavasthaarth
 Work arrangement means that you teach in college a and there is no teacher in college B, then you will be sent to college b for three months
 magar college a ke teacher itane pareshaan ho gaye ki court se ste le aae
 So now a new method has been worked out
 lekturer ko 15 dinon ke liye kisi duusare college main bhejo
 This system is called work system
 isamen kaary bhi he, vyavastha bhi, yatharth bhi he or arthath bhi he
 All are made together, that is, the system of work ie problem
 rajasthan sarkaar ne 21 oktober ko aadesh jari kiya he
 The name of the organization that issued the order is Commissionerate College Education, Rajasthan, Jaipur

 It has been told that from which college the teacher will be sent to which college for 15 days

 Both will have responsibility to attempt to complete the course within 30 days
 isaki soochna principal ko dene ke baad hi apane mul college kii taraf prasthaan karenge
 279 teachers have been selected to complete the course in 30 days
 kya do teacher milakar 30 din main kisi bhi paathyakram ko puraa kar sakate he? bharat ko vishwa guru banane kaa chuuran khuleam bechaa ja rahaa he
 This idea is the only one because it can be expected from the teachers of India that it is amazing to complete the course in 30 days
 jahaan se ye teacher 15-15 din ke liye hataae jaaenge vahaan to vishay tham jayega
 This will complete the course in one year in a college in Rajasthan and 30 days in a year
 kamaal kaa idia he na
 You are watching Ragdarbari, college government and students
 lekin is suchi yah to pataa chal gaya ki kahaan kahaan zero teacher hai
 There is no teacher of Geography in Chaumhala Government College
 manoharthana rajkeey mahavidhyalay main sanskrit kaa koi teacher nahin he
 There is also no teacher in Sociology at Manorathana College
 khanpur rajkeey mahavidhyalay main itihaas, bhugol, samajashaastra main zero teacher hai
 The solution to the problem will be to make permanent appointment of teachers
 niryaat karne laayak shikshak taiyaar nahin hote hai tab tak aayaat se hi in khaali padon ko bharaa ja saktaa he
 This list has names of many cities that are not pronounced on TV
 jaise khetadi, jhaadol, kekadi
 There are zero teachers in many subjects of state colleges here
 is suchi se pataa chalata he ki kai collejon main sanskrit ke shikshakon kii padasthapana par khaasaa jor diya gaya he
 After all, Sanskrit will not be insulted, Hindustan type slogans have to be shown before doing anything on the walls
 30 din ke liye sanskrit ke shikshak bheje ja rahe hai
 Even when there were no teachers, i was having fun with Sanskrit, now when i try to complete the course in 30 days, it will be a laughter challenge, not a joke
 aadesh main likhaa he ki aane jane kaa kiraaya diya jayega
 The order regarding 15 days stay, food and drink is not clear
 guest teacher kii sthiti thik nahin he
 This idea of sending for 15-15 days is new because the teacher was sent for the first three months, then the teacher went to court and brought a stay against it
 lagata he isse bachane ke liye 15 din main course puraa karne kaa laughter chalange aayaa he
 Zafar Multani has sent a story from Agar Malwa in Madhya Pradesh to draw attention to a problem of guest teachers 
 aap jaanate hai ki madhya pradesh main guest teacher ko atithi vidwaan kaha jaataa he
 According to this, whether the permanent teacher there is considered a scholar or not is not known
 atithi bhi or vidwaan bhi, sunakar lagegaa ki zyaada khatiradaari inhen kii hoti he
 But these are the most exploited
 collejon main shikshakon ko theke par rakhane kii jo shabdaawalee namavali kaa prayog hua he, uskaa sankalan karenge to puri ek kitaab ban jaaegi
 Guest scholar Namita comes to teach at the Government Nehru College here from 70 km away
 namita uniwarsity topper rahi hai
 Namita had Uterus surgery a few days ago
 sarkaar kaa niyam he ki koi bhi atithi vidwaan lagaataar saat dinon kaa avkaash nahin le saktaa he
 If you take more than seven days off, then the work will be freed, ie will be removed
 namita naukari bachaane ke liye surgery kii hilat main bhi safar karti raheen or college aati rahi
 Anyway, the salary you get is spent on the petrol of the car itself
 aap sochie mahila atithi vidwaan ko maa banane par kitni chuttee milti hogi
 When we found out, it was told that the guest scholar does not qualify for maternity leave maternity leave
 aapako shauking nahin laga, angrezi main nahin laga to kya hindi main hairaani nahin hui
 Not only this, it is also important for the guest scholar to go to seminar, present the paper, but the salary is deducted when they go
 permanent teacher jate hai to unka vetan nahin katataa he
 You understand the reasoning behind this
 ab aaiye mumbai uniwarsity
 For the first time in its history, the Vice Chancellor has been dismissed
 itihaas main barkhaastagi se apana naam darz karaane vaale sanjay deshmukh kuch or maamalon main itihaas banaate banaate rah gaye
 RTI activist Anil Galgali has revealed that Sanjay Deshmukh failed the LLB exam in 2015 before becoming a VC
 iske baad bhi ve 774 collejon kii uniwarsity kaa visi banaae gaye
 The Times of India has written that he is close to the RSS
 aresas ko sanjay deshmukh se duuri bana leni chahie kyonki anil galgali ne khulaasa kiya he ki sanjay deshmukh ne apane kaarykaal main ricard videsh yatraaen kii hai
 Our colleague Sohit Mishra said that he broke the 100 million fixed deposit
 yah bhi pataa chal rahaa he ki vaais chancelar sahab vidhyaarthiyon ke paise se hawaii jahaaz kareednaa chaahate the
 The plane
 hamaare vaais chancelaron ne uniwarsity kii uniwarsity barbaad kar di magar ye pehle honge jinhone barbaad karne ke baad hawaii jahaaz kareedne kaa sapana dekha
 If this is true, then before writing a VC one should write that i will ruin the university as soon as possible by running the political agenda of the appointee but will not buy the plane with his money
 is khabar ko bataate hue dil dhadak rahaa he
 Know why it may not have happened, but Sohit Mishra has told that Sanjay Deshmukh has also applied for a private license to fly the ship
 kaash ye khabar galat ho
 They also wanted to fly along with buying airplanes
 ye hua na sachcha visi
 Thought to save the pilot's cost
 agar vipaksh ko fiks karne ke kaam se sibiai, idi
 If the income tax department is free for a few hours, then you should also meet Sanjay Deshmukh
 vipaksh in jaanch agenciyon par yahi aarope lagaataa he ki unheen ke peeche padi hai, kisi or ke nahin
 By the way, the big breaking news is that the proposal to buy aircraft at the university did not pass
 tippaniyan Meanwhile, students demanding a repeat check have changed the field
 ab ve uniwarsity ke maidan se nikal kar azaad maidan aa gaye hai
 Again annoyed with the increase in examination fees
 500 rupee kii fees ko badhaakar 1050 rupee kar die gaye hai
 Think if Sanjay Deshmukh had bought the ship, it would have been amazing
 bachche binar lekar mumbai kii sadakon par daudte rahete or visi samandar ke upar jahaaz udaate hue hansate rahete
 Yahoo continued to do Yahoo
 chaatr to phir bhi pradarshan kar lete hai
 On contract, on contract, part time teaching teachers cannot perform
 nunatam mazaduri se bhi kam par padhaa rahe hai, biimaar hote hai to chuttee nahin mil sakati, bukaar main college ja rahe hai, or aap hamen hansaa hansaa kar maare ja rahe hai ki ham vishwa guru banane vaale hai
 Take a break, i will show another example of the broken system, there can be not only communal politics in India on Krabistan and crematorium, people have proved that they can also scam in this matter
 banaras ke sampoornanand sanskrit vishvavidhyalay ke chaatro ke pradarshan ko chhod den to har jagah chaatr bhi usee tarah ke vaakya bolte nazar aae jis tarah ke unke principal bolte hai, jis tarah ke unke ghar vaale, golmol
 On the other hand, the movement of students of Mumbai University was stubborn, slogans were heard and the tone was also raised
 banaras ke sampoornanand sanskrit uniwarsity ke chaatro ke pradarshan main pataa hi nahin chalata he ki karmkand kar rahe hai yaa loktantr kaa cond kar rahe hai
 The slogans of students in the School of Planning and Architecture are going on from 9 am on 26 October
 26 kii puri raat ve campus main baahar hi narebaazi karte rahe
 Seeing the demands they were demonstrating, the students outside Delhi must be thinking that we have more problems than these, but we have adjusted, why are they doing hi
 darasal, lagata he hamaare raajnneetik or saamaajik sanskaar se bolnaa chalaa gaya he
 Now we consider speaking on Facebook itself, we have started to remain very silent in front of authority or administration
 espie ke is andolan kii vajah he yah aag
 a fire broke out from the shot circuit at the Girls Hostel on campus around 5 am on 26 October
 jis vakt aag lagi, us vakt kamare main koi ladki nahin thi
 Due to the fire, all the contents of the room burned to ashes
 is kamare main rahane vaali do ladkiyaan iraq kii hai jinka passport bhi jal gaya he
 They say that up to six lakh items were burnt
 pankhaa tut kar neeche aa gira
 Thankfully there was no one in the room at that time, otherwise if the three girls were here then anything could have happened
 aag kii is ghatana ne hostel kii suraksha vyavastha kii pole khol di
 The guards did not know how to use fire extinguishers and the students were not even given training on what to do if there was a fire
 1941 main bana tha espie
 It is the oldest and reputed institute in the country where planning and architect studies
 is college kii sthapana isliye kii gai thi ki yahaan se nikalne vaale chaatr gaanv, shahar or anya kshetron main planning karne main madad karenge
 Seeing the planning of towns, you can be sure that no one has ever studied architects and planning in India
 2015 main sansad dwaara kanoon paas kar ise rashtriya mahatv ke santhaan ke rup main ghoshit kiya gaya
 Students of this institute of national importance also understand the importance of the movement
 loktantr main agar aapane dharna yaa pradarshan nahin diya, yaa shaamil nahin hue, yakicanan aapane loktantr jiyaa hi nahin
 Taking the banner in hand is the most beautiful scene of democracy
 aise drishyon ke bagair na to aap naagarik banate hai or na manushya
 These words written on the banner are not just slogans but poetry
 ise uthaa kar jab aap class room se nikal kar college ke campus ke kisi angan main jamaa hone pahunch rahe hote hai tab aap apane bheetar ke bhay se azaad ho rahe hote hai or bolne kaa farz adaa karne kii taiyaari kar chuke hote hai
 Speaking is to improve oneself
 espie ke ye chaatr aag kii suraksha ko lekar yahaan jamaa ho chuke hai
 It is the strength of the group that makes administration polite
 pehle din andekha karne ke baad duusare din jab andolan chalaa to college ke dean haazir ho gaye
 Students have started answering questions from the Dean
 sawaal hi nahin kiya to aapane jivan kya jiyaa
 SPA is Dimmed University
 1200 chaatr padhate hai
 Nevertheless, the list of problems of hostels here is quite long
 ek chaatr ne bataaya ki hostel main pani saaf nahin aata he jisaki vajah se chaatr baahar se pani kii bottle karidate hai
 a student spends thousand to fifteen hundred rupees on water
 ceiling tut kar girti rahati he
 Students tell that snakes also come here
 bandar or chuuhe to aate jate hi rahete hai
 The agitating students have searched the entire budget of the college
 baqayda notice board par laga diya he
 The institute is facing budget cuts even after being on the priority list
 2013-14 main espie kaa bajet praavdhaan tha 45 karod magar mila 28 karod
 SPA budget provision in 2014-15 was 46 crores but got 30 crores
 2015-16 main espie kaa bajet praavdhaan tha 40 karod magar mila 26 karod
 You see how the budget is getting less
 iskaa asar yahaan kii buniyadi suvidhaon par pad rahaa he
 There should be a doctor in college but there is not
 dawa bhi uplabdh nahin he
 The girls hostel has only eight toilets on one floor while sixty girls live there
 unke hisaab se yah kaaphi kam he
 SPA students said that cleanliness was in bad shape
 andolan ke dauraan unhone is kachare ko saaf kar jamaa kar diya
 Students say that mosquitoes rule the campus due to which many students have dengue
 puraane cooler kaa kabad yahaan jamaa he
 By the way, you go to the mohallas of Delhi, old cars and scooters are frozen as junk
 koi hataane vaala nahin he
 The condition of the campus is also similar
 espie dimd uniwarsity he
 Here too, there are not as many teachers as there should be
 aankade bataate hai ki manzur padon kii tulana main kam shikshak hai or shikshakon kii sankhya kam hi hoti ja rahi he
 In 2014, 32 positions were approved for professors, 29 were professors
 2014 se lekar 2016 tak yah sankhya 29 se kam hokar 23 par pahunch gai
 In 2014, 44 posts of Associate Professor were approved but 30 were working
 2014 main 30 associat professor the or 2016 main 31, yani 13 kii kami he
 There is also a shortage of teachers in the School of Planning and Architects
 ab chalate hai rajasthan
 The system here uses one word, work arrangement
 kaary vyavasthaarth kaa matlab yah hua ki aap college a main padhaate hai or college ba main teacher nahin he to aapako teen maheene ke liye college ba main bhej diya jayega
 But the college a teacher got so upset that he got a stay from the court
 to ab nayaa tarika nikaala gaya he
 Send the lecturer to another college for 15 days
 isi system ko kaary vyavasthaarth kehete hai
 There is also work in it, system is also there, it is also real and it is also meaning sab milakar banate hai kaary vyavasthaarth yani samasya saakshaat
 The Government of Rajasthan has issued the order on 21 October
 aadesh jari karne vaali sanstha kaa naam he ayuktalay college shiksha, rajasthan, jaipur
 The entire chart is made in this order
 bataaya gaya he ki kis college se teacher ko kis college main 15 din ke liye bheja jayega
 According to this order, two teachers will be sent alternately for 15 days in a teacher-less college
 donon par zimmedaari hogi ki 30 dinon ke bheetar paathyakram puraa karne kaa prayaas karenge
 Only after informing the principal will he leave for his native college
 30 dinon main course puraa karne ke liye 279 shikshakon kaa chayan kiya gaya he
 Can two teachers together complete any course in 30 days? Churan is being sold openly to make India a world guru
 ye idia chuuran hi he kyonki 30 din main paathyakram puraa karne ke kamaal kii ummid bharat ke hi shikshakon se hi kii ja sakati he
 From where these teachers will be removed for 15-15 days, then the subject will stop
 isse rajasthan ke ek college main ek saal main course puraa hoga or ek saal main 30 din
 This is an amazing idea
 aap dekh rahe hai ragadrabari, college sarkari or chaatr tarkari
 But on this list, it was known that where there are zero teachers
 chaumahala rajkeey mahavidhyalay main bhugol kaa koi teacher nahin he
 There is no Sanskrit teacher in Manoharathana Government College
 manoharthana mahavidhyalay main samajashaastra main bhi koi teacher nahin he
 Khanpur Government College has zero teachers in History, Geography, Sociology
 samasya kaa samaadhaan yahi hoga ki shikshakon kii sthaayee niyukti kii jaae
 Till exportable teachers are not ready, then these vacant positions can be filled only by import
 is suchi main kai shaharon ke naam hai jinka uccharan tivi par nahin hota he
 Such as Khetri, Jhadoul, Kekri
 yahaan ke rajkeey collejon ke kai vishyon main zero teacher hai
 This list shows that there is a lot of emphasis on the posting of Sanskrit teachers in many colleges
 akhir sanskrit kaa apmaan, nahin sahegaa hindustan tip naare deevaaron par likhane se pehle kuch to karke dikhaanaa hi hoga
 Sanskrit teachers are being sent for 30 days
 jab teacher nahin the tab bhi sanskrit ke saath mazaaq ho rahaa tha, ab jah 30 din main course puraa karaane kaa prayaas karenge to yah mazaaq nahin, laughter chalange hoga
 It is written in the order that the fare to be paid will be paid
 15 din thaharne, khaane pine ke bare main aadesh spasht nahin he
 The status of guest teacher is not good
 15-15 dinon ke liye bheje jane kaa yah idia nayaa he kyonki pehle teen teen maheene ke liye shikshak bheje jate the to iske khilaaf shikshak court chale gaye or ste le aae
 To avoid this, a laughter challenge has come to complete the course in 15 days
 jafar multani ne madhya pradesh ke agar malwa se guest shikshakon kii ek samasya kii taraf dhyaan khinchne ke liye story bheji he
 You know that the guest teacher in Madhya Pradesh is called a guest scholar
 is hisaab se vahaan ke permanent teacher ko vidwaan samajha jaataa he yaa nahin, pataa nahin
 The guest as well as the scholar, will hear that they are more interested
 magar sabase zyaada shoshan inhen kaa hota he
 If you compile the terminology nomenclature used to hire teachers in colleges, then the entire book will be made
 yahaan ke shaskeey nehru mahavidhyalay main atithi vidwaan namita 70 kimi dur se padhaane aati he
 Namita has been a university topper
 kuch dinon pehle namita kaa utaras kii surgery hui thi
 The government rules that no guest scholar can take seven consecutive days off
 saat dinon se zyaada avkaash legaa to kaary mukt kar diya jayega yani hataa diya jayega
 Namita also traveled to surgery to save her job and kept coming to college
 vaise bhi jo selary milti he wo car ke petrol par hi karch ho jaati he
 Think about how much leave a female guest scholar will get when she becomes a mother
 hamane pataa kiya to bataaya gaya ki atithi vidwaan ko matternity live maatrutiv avkaash kii paatrata nahin he
 You did not feel fond of, did not engage in English, then it was not surprising in Hindi
 yahi nahin atithi vidwaan ke liye bhi zaruri he ki ve seminar main jaaen, paper pragent karen magar jab ve jate hai to vetan cat jaataa he
 When a permanent teacher goes, his salary is not deducted
 aapako iske peeche kaa tark samaj aayaa
 Now come to Mumbai University
 iske itihaas main pehali baar vaais chancelar ko barkhaast kiya gaya he
 Sanjay Deshmukh, who has got his name recorded in history, kept making history in some other cases
 artiai kaaryakarta anil galgali ne yah khulaasa kiya he ki sanjay deshmukh visi banane se pehle 2015 main elelbi kii pariksha main fail ho gaye the
 Even after this, he was made the VC of the University of 774 colleges
 times of india ne likhaa he ki ve aresas ke kareebi hai
 The RSS should distance itself from Sanjay Deshmukh as Anil Galgali has revealed that Sanjay Deshmukh has made record overseas trips during his tenure
 hamaare sahyogi sohit mishra ne bataaya ki unhone 100 karod kii fiks dipazit tod di
 It is also being learned that the Vice Chancellor had wanted to buy the plane with the money of the students
 hawaii jahaaz
 Our Vice Chancellors ruined the university but they will be the first who dreamed of buying a plane after the ruin
 agar yah sahi he to visi banane se pehle likhva lenaa chahie ki main niyukt karne vaale ke raajnneetik agenda ko chalaate hue uniwarsity ko jald se jald barbaad kar duungaa magar uske paise se hawaii jahaaz nahin kharidoongaa
 Heart beats telling this news
 jane kyon lag rahaa he ki aisa nahin hua hoga magar sohit mishra ne bataaya he ki sanjay deshmukh ne jahaaz udaane hetu privet license ke liye applai bhi kiya
 i wish this news was wrong
 hawaii jahaaz kareedne ke saath ye udaana bhi chaahate the
 This is not true VC payalat kaa karcha bachaane kii sochi
 If the CBI, ED, by the work of fixing the opposition
 iskar vibhaag kuch ghante ke liye free ho to sanjay deshmukh se bhi mil aana chahie
 The opposition accuses these investigative agencies that they are behind them, not anyone else
 vaise big braking news yahi he ki vishvavidhyalay main aircraft kareedne kaa prastaav paas nahin hua
 The comments is bich dobaaraa kapi check karaane kii maang karne vaale chaatro ne maidan badal diya he
 Now they have come out of university grounds to Azad Maidan
 dobaaraa pariksha kii fees vruddhi se naaraaz hai
 The fee of Rs 500 has been increased to Rs 1050
 sochie sanjay deshmukh ne jahaaz kareed liya hota to gazab ho jaataa
 Children would run on the streets of Mumbai carrying banners and laughing while flying ships over VC sea
 yahuu yahuu karte rahe
 Students still perform
 sanvida par, theke par, anshkalik padhaane vaale teacher to pradarshan bhi nahin kar sakate hai
 We are teaching less than the minimum wage, we cannot get leave if we are ill, we are going to college in Bukhar, and you are killing us by making us laugh that we are going to become world gurus
 brake le lijie broken system kaa ek or namoona dikhaaungaa, bharat main krabian or shmashaan ko lekar sirf sampradayik raajnneeti hi nahin ho sakati he, logon ne sabit kar diya he ki ve is maamle main ghotaalaa bhi kar sakate hai
 The slogans of students in the School of Planning and Architecture are going on from 9 am on 26 October

 The guest as well as the scholar, will hear that they are more interested
 magar sabase zyaada shoshan inhen kaa hota he
 If you compile the terminology nomenclature used to hire teachers in colleges, then the entire book will be made
 yahaan ke shaskeey nehru mahavidhyalay main atithi vidwaan namita 70 kimi dur se padhaane aati he
 Namita has been a university topper
 kuch dinon pehle namita kaa utaras kii surgery hui thi
 The government rules that no guest scholar can take seven consecutive days off
 saat dinon se zyaada avkaash legaa to kaary mukt kar diya jayega yani hataa diya jayega
 Namita also traveled to surgery to save her job and kept coming to college
 vaise bhi jo selary milti he wo car ke petrol par hi karch ho jaati he
 Think about how much leave a female guest scholar will get when she becomes a mother
 hamane pataa kiya to bataaya gaya ki atithi vidwaan ko matternity live maatrutiv avkaash kii paatrata nahin he
 You did not feel fond of, did not engage in English, then it was not surprising in Hindi
 yahi nahin atithi vidwaan ke liye bhi zaruri he ki ve seminar main jaaen, paper pragent karen magar jab ve jate hai to vetan cat jaataa he
 When a permanent teacher goes, his salary is not deducted
 aapako iske peeche kaa tark samaj aayaa
 Now come to Mumbai University
 iske itihaas main pehali baar vaais chancelar ko barkhaast kiya gaya he
 Sanjay Deshmukh, who has got his name recorded in history, kept making history in some other cases
 artiai kaaryakarta anil galgali ne yah khulaasa kiya he ki sanjay deshmukh visi banane se pehle 2015 main elelbi kii pariksha main fail ho gaye the
 Even after this, he was made the VC of the University of 774 colleges
 times of india ne likhaa he ki ve aresas ke kareebi hai
 The RSS should distance itself from Sanjay Deshmukh as Anil Galgali has revealed that Sanjay Deshmukh has made record overseas trips during his tenure
 hamaare sahyogi sohit mishra ne bataaya ki unhone 100 karod kii fiks dipazit tod di
 It is also being learned that the Vice Chancellor had wanted to buy the plane with the money of the students
 hawaii jahaaz
 Our Vice Chancellors ruined the university but they will be the first who dreamed of buying a plane after the ruin
 agar yah sahi he to visi banane se pehle likhva lenaa chahie ki main niyukt karne vaale ke raajnneetik agenda ko chalaate hue uniwarsity ko jald se jald barbaad kar duungaa magar uske paise se hawaii jahaaz nahin kharidoongaa
 Heart beats telling this news
 jane kyon lag rahaa he ki aisa nahin hua hoga magar sohit mishra ne bataaya he ki sanjay deshmukh ne jahaaz udaane hetu privet license ke liye applai bhi kiya
 i wish this news was wrong
 hawaii jahaaz kareedne ke saath ye udaana bhi chaahate the
 This is not true VC payalat kaa karcha bachaane kii sochi
 If the CBI, ED, by the work of fixing the opposition
 iskar vibhaag kuch ghante ke liye free ho to sanjay deshmukh se bhi mil aana chahie
 The opposition accuses these investigative agencies that they are behind them, not anyone else
 vaise big braking news yahi he ki vishvavidhyalay main aircraft kareedne kaa prastaav paas nahin hua
 The comments is bich dobaaraa kapi check karaane kii maang karne vaale chaatro ne maidan badal diya he
 Now they have come out of university grounds to Azad Maidan
 dobaaraa pariksha kii fees vruddhi se naaraaz hai
 The fee of Rs 500 has been increased to Rs 1050
 sochie sanjay deshmukh ne jahaaz kareed liya hota to gazab ho jaataa
 Children would run on the streets of Mumbai carrying banners and laughing while flying ships over VC sea
 yahuu yahuu karte rahe
 Students still perform
 sanvida par, theke par, anshkalik padhaane vaale teacher to pradarshan bhi nahin kar sakate hai
 We are teaching less than the minimum wage, we cannot get leave if we are ill, we are going to college in Bukhar, and you are killing us by making us laugh that we are going to become world gurus
 brake le lijie broken system kaa ek or namoona dikhaaungaa, bharat main krabian or shmashaan ko lekar sirf sampradayik raajnneeti hi nahin ho sakati he, logon ne sabit kar diya he ki ve is maamle main ghotaalaa bhi kar sakate hai
 This fire is the cause of this movement of SPA
 26 oktober kii subah 5 baje ke kareeb campus ke girls hostel main shot circuit se aag lag gai
 At the time of the fire, there was no girl in the room
 aag ke kaaran kamare kaa sara saamaan jal kar raakh ho gaya
 The two girls living in this room are from Iraq whose passport is also burnt
 inkaa kahana he ki chah lakh tak ke saamaan jal gaye
 The fan broke down and came down
 ganimat he ki us vakt kamare main koi nahin tha, varanaa agar teenon ladkiyaan yahaan hoti to kuch bhi ho saktaa tha
 This incident of fire exposed the security of the hostel
 guard ko aag bujhane ke silendar kaa istemaal karnaa nahin aata tha or chaatraon ko bhi training nahin di gai thi ki aag lagane par kya karnaa he
 SPA was formed in 1941
 yah desh kaa sabase purana or pratishthit santhaan he jahaan planning or architect kii padhai hoti he
 This college was established so that the students coming out of it will help in planning in the village, city and other areas
 kasbon kii planning kaa haal dekhakar aap nishcint ho sakate hai ki bharat main kabhi kisi ne architect or planning kii kabhi padhai hi nahin kii he
 In 2015, it was declared as an institution of national importance by passing legislation by the Parliament
 rashtriya mahatv ke is santhaan ke chaatr andolan ke mahatv ko bhi samajhate hai
 If you did not protest or participate in democracy, or did not join, then you did not live democracy
 haath main binar lekar chalanaa loktantr kaa sabase kuubasurat drishy he
 Without such scenes neither you become a citizen nor a human being
 binar par likhe ye shabd sirf naare nahin hai balki kavita hai
 By picking this up, when you are coming out of the class room to gather in a courtyard on the campus of the college, then you are freed from your inner fear and have prepared to pay the duty of speaking
 bolnaa khud ko behatar karnaa he
 These students of SPA have gathered here for the safety of fire
 samooh kii yah takat hi he jo prashasan ko vinamr banaati he
 After ignoring the first day, when the agitation went on the second day, the Dean of the college appeared
 chaatr dean se sawaal jawaab karne lage hai
 If you did not question, what did you live? espie dimd uniwarsity he
 1200 students study
 phir bhi yahaan ke hostel kii samasyaon kii suchi kaaphi lambii he
 One student said that water does not come clean in the hostel, due to which students buy bottles of water from outside
 ek chaatr pani par hazaar se pandrah sau rupee karch karata he
 The ceiling keeps falling apart
 chaatr bataate hai ki yahaan saanp bhi aate hai
 Monkeys and rats keep coming
 andolan karne vaale chaatro ne college kaa puraa bajet chaan maaraa he
 The notice board has been installed
 yah santhaan praathamikta suchi main hone ke baad bhi bajet kii katautee kaa saamana kar rahaa he
 In 2013-14, the budget provision of SPA was 45 crores but got 28 crores
 2014-15 main espie kaa bajet praavdhaan tha 46 karod magar mila 30 karod
 In 2015-16, the budget provision of SPA was 40 crores but got 26 crores
 aap dekh rahe hai ki kis tarah bajet kam mil rahaa he
 This is affecting the basic facilities here
 college main doctor hona chahie magar nahin he
 Medication is also not available
 girls hostel main ek floor par aath hi shauchalay hai jabaki saath chatraayen rahati hai
 According to him this is quite low
 espie ke chaatro ne bataaya ki safai kaa bura haal he
 During the movement, he cleaned and deposited this waste
 chaatro kaa kahana he ki campus main machharon kaa raaj he jisaki vajah se kai chaatro ko dengue ho chukaa he
 The junk of the old cooler is stored here
 vaise aap dilli ke mohallon main jaaiye puraani gaadiyaan or scooter kabad ke rup main jame hue hai
 There is no removal
 campus kaa haal bhi kuch aisa hi he
 SPA is deemed university
 yahaan bhi jitne shikshak hone chahie utane nahin hai
 Statistics show that there are fewer teachers than the sanctioned posts and the number of teachers is decreasing
 2014 main professor ke liye 32 pad manzur hai, 29 professor the
 From 2014 to 2016, this number decreased from 29 to 23
 2014 main associat professor ke 44 pad manzur the magar kaam kar rahe the 30
 There were 30 associate professors in 2014 and 31 in 2016, a decrease of 13
 skool of planning and architector main bhi shikshakon kii kami he
 Now let's go to Rajasthan
 yahaan ke system main ek shabd kaa istamaal hota he, kaary vyavasthaarth
 Work arrangement means that you teach in college a and there is no teacher in college B, then you will be sent to college b for three months
 magar college a ke teacher itane pareshaan ho gaye ki court se ste le aae
 So now a new method has been worked out
 lekturer ko 15 dinon ke liye kisi duusare college main bhejo
 This system is called work system
 isamen kaary bhi he, vyavastha bhi, yatharth bhi he or arthath bhi he
 All are made together, that is, the system of work ie problem
 rajasthan sarkaar ne 21 oktober ko aadesh jari kiya he
 The name of the organization that issued the order is Commissionerate College Education, Rajasthan, Jaipur
 is aadesh main puraa chart bana he
 It has been told that from which college the teacher will be sent to which college for 15 days
 is aadesh ke mutabik shikshakavihin college main do shikshak baari baari se 15-15 din ke liye bheje jaaenge
 Both will have responsibility to attempt to complete the course within 30 days
 isaki soochna principal ko dene ke baad hi apane mul college kii taraf prasthaan karenge
 279 teachers have been selected to complete the course in 30 days
 kya do teacher milakar 30 din main kisi bhi paathyakram ko puraa kar sakate he? bharat ko vishwa guru banane kaa chuuran khuleam bechaa ja rahaa he
 This idea is the only one because it can be expected from the teachers of India that it is amazing to complete the course in 30 days
 jahaan se ye teacher 15-15 din ke liye hataae jaaenge vahaan to vishay tham jayega
 This will complete the course in one year in a college in Rajasthan and 30 days in a year
 kamaal kaa idia he na
 You are watching Ragdarbari, college government and students
 lekin is suchi yah to pataa chal gaya ki kahaan kahaan zero teacher hai
 There is no teacher of Geography in Chaumhala Government College
 manoharthana rajkeey mahavidhyalay main sanskrit kaa koi teacher nahin he
 There is also no teacher in Sociology at Manorathana College
 khanpur rajkeey mahavidhyalay main itihaas, bhugol, samajashaastra main zero teacher hai
 The solution to the problem will be to make permanent appointment of teachers
 niryaat karne laayak shikshak taiyaar nahin hote hai tab tak aayaat se hi in khaali padon ko bharaa ja saktaa he
 This list has names of many cities that are not pronounced on TV
 jaise khetadi, jhaadol, kekadi
 There are zero teachers in many subjects of state colleges here
 is suchi se pataa chalata he ki kai collejon main sanskrit ke shikshakon kii padasthapana par khaasaa jor diya gaya he
 After all, Sanskrit will not be insulted, Hindustan type slogans have to be shown before doing anything on the walls
 30 din ke liye sanskrit ke shikshak bheje ja rahe hai
 Even when there were no teachers, i was having fun with Sanskrit, now when i try to complete the course in 30 days, it will be a laughter challenge, not a joke
 aadesh main likhaa he ki aane jane kaa kiraaya diya jayega
 The order regarding 15 days stay, food and drink is not clear
 guest teacher kii sthiti thik nahin he
 This idea of sending for 15-15 days is new because the teacher was sent for the first three months, then the teacher went to court and brought a stay against it
 lagata he isse bachane ke liye 15 din main course puraa karne kaa laughter chalange aayaa he
 Zafar Multani has sent a story from Agar Malwa in Madhya Pradesh to draw attention to a problem of guest teachers
 aap jaanate hai ki madhya pradesh main guest teacher ko atithi vidwaan kaha jaataa he
 According to this, whether the permanent teacher there is considered a scholar or not is not known
 atithi bhi or vidwaan bhi, sunakar lagegaa ki zyaada khatiradaari inhen kii hoti he
 But these are the most exploited
 collejon main shikshakon ko theke par rakhane kii jo shabdaawalee namavali kaa prayog hua he, uskaa sankalan karenge to puri ek kitaab ban jaaegi
 Guest scholar Namita comes to teach at the Government Nehru College here from 70 km away
 namita uniwarsity topper rahi hai
 Namita had Uterus surgery a few days ago
 sarkaar kaa niyam he ki koi bhi atithi vidwaan lagaataar saat dinon kaa avkaash nahin le saktaa he
 If you take more than seven days off, then the work will be freed, ie will be removed
 namita naukari bachaane ke liye surgery kii hilat main bhi safar karti raheen or college aati rahi
 Anyway, the salary you get is spent on the petrol of the car itself
 aap sochie mahila atithi vidwaan ko maa banane par kitni chuttee milti hogi
 When we found out, it was told that the guest scholar does not qualify for maternity leave maternity leave
 aapako shauking nahin laga, angrezi main nahin laga to kya hindi main hairaani nahin hui
 Not only this, it is also important for the guest scholar to go to seminar, present the paper, but the salary is deducted when they go
 permanent teacher jate hai to unka vetan nahin katataa he
 You understand the reasoning behind this
 ab aaiye mumbai uniwarsity
 For the first time in its history, the Vice Chancellor has been dismissed
 itihaas main barkhaastagi se apana naam darz karaane vaale sanjay deshmukh kuch or maamalon main itihaas banaate banaate rah gaye
 RTI activist Anil Galgali has revealed that Sanjay Deshmukh failed the LLB exam in 2015 before becoming a VC
 iske baad bhi ve 774 collejon kii uniwarsity kaa visi banaae gaye
 The Times of India has written that he is close to the RSS
 aresas ko sanjay deshmukh se duuri bana leni chahie kyonki anil galgali ne khulaasa kiya he ki sanjay deshmukh ne apane kaarykaal main ricard videsh yatraaen kii hai
 Our colleague Sohit Mishra said that he broke the 100 million fixed deposit
 yah bhi pataa chal rahaa he ki vaais chancelar sahab vidhyaarthiyon ke paise se hawaii jahaaz kareednaa chaahate the
 The plane
 hamaare vaais chancelaron ne uniwarsity kii uniwarsity barbaad kar di magar ye pehle honge jinhone barbaad karne ke baad hawaii jahaaz kareedne kaa sapana dekha
 If this is true, then before writing a VC one should write that i will ruin the university as soon as possible by running the political agenda of the appointee but will not buy the plane with his money
 is khabar ko bataate hue dil dhadak rahaa he
 Know why it may not have happened, but Sohit Mishra has told that Sanjay Deshmukh has also applied for a private license to fly the ship
 kaash ye khabar galat ho
 They also wanted to fly along with buying airplanes
 ye hua na sachcha visi
 Thought to save the pilot's cost
 agar vipaksh ko fiks karne ke kaam se sibiai, idi
 If the income tax department is free for a few hours, then you should also meet Sanjay Deshmukh
 vipaksh in jaanch agenciyon par yahi aarope lagaataa he ki unheen ke peeche padi hai, kisi or ke nahin
 By the way, the big breaking news is that the proposal to buy aircraft at the university did not pass
 tippaniyan Meanwhile, students demanding a repeat check have changed the field
 ab ve uniwarsity ke maidan se nikal kar azaad maidan aa gaye hai
 Again annoyed with the increase in examination fees
 500 rupee kii fees ko badhaakar 1050 rupee kar die gaye hai
 Think if Sanjay Deshmukh had bought the ship, it would have been amazing
 bachche binar lekar mumbai kii sadakon par daudte rahete or visi samandar ke upar jahaaz udaate hue hansate rahete
 Yahoo continued to do Yahoo
 chaatr to phir bhi pradarshan kar lete hai
 On contract, on contract, part time teaching teachers cannot perform
 nunatam mazaduri se bhi kam par padhaa rahe hai, biimaar hote hai to chuttee nahin mil sakati, bukaar main college ja rahe hai, or aap hamen hansaa hansaa kar maare ja rahe hai ki ham vishwa guru banane vaale hai
 Take a break, i will show another example of the broken system, there can be not only communal politics in India on Krabistan and crematorium, people have proved that they can also scam in this matter
 1941 main bana tha espie
 It is the oldest and reputed institute in the country where planning and architect studies
 is college kii sthapana isliye kii gai thi ki yahaan se nikalne vaale chaatr gaanv, shahar or anya kshetron main planning karne main madad karenge
 Seeing the planning of towns, you can be sure that no one has ever studied architects and planning in India
 2015 main sansad dwaara kanoon paas kar ise rashtriya mahatv ke santhaan ke rup main ghoshit kiya gaya
 Students of this institute of national importance also understand the importance of the movement
 loktantr main agar aapane dharna yaa pradarshan nahin diya, yaa shaamil nahin hue, yakicanan aapane loktantr jiyaa hi nahin
 Taking the banner in hand is the most beautiful scene of democracy
 aise drishyon ke bagair na to aap naagarik banate hai or na manushya
 These words written on the banner are not just slogans but poetry
 ise uthaa kar jab aap class room se nikal kar college ke campus ke kisi angan main jamaa hone pahunch rahe hote hai tab aap apane bheetar ke bhay se azaad ho rahe hote hai or bolne kaa farz adaa karne kii taiyaari kar chuke hote hai
 Speaking is to improve oneself
 espie ke ye chaatr aag kii suraksha ko lekar yahaan jamaa ho chuke hai
 It is the strength of the group that makes administration polite
 pehle din andekha karne ke baad duusare din jab andolan chalaa to college ke dean haazir ho gaye
 Students have started answering questions from the Dean
 sawaal hi nahin kiya to aapane jivan kya jiyaa
 SPA is Dimmed University
 1200 chaatr padhate hai
 Nevertheless, the list of problems of hostels here is quite long
 ek chaatr ne bataaya ki hostel main pani saaf nahin aata he jisaki vajah se chaatr baahar se pani kii bottle karidate hai
 a student spends thousand to fifteen hundred rupees on water
 ceiling tut kar girti rahati he
 Students tell that snakes also come here
 bandar or chuuhe to aate jate hi rahete hai
 The agitating students have searched the entire budget of the college
 baqayda notice board par laga diya he
 The institute is facing budget cuts even after being on the priority list
 2013-14 main espie kaa bajet praavdhaan tha 45 karod magar mila 28 karod
 SPA budget provision in 2014-15 was 46 crores but got 30 crores
 2015-16 main espie kaa bajet praavdhaan tha 40 karod magar mila 26 karod
 You see how the budget is getting less
 iskaa asar yahaan kii buniyadi suvidhaon par pad rahaa he
 There should be a doctor in college but there is not
 dawa bhi uplabdh nahin he
 The girls hostel has only eight toilets on one floor while sixty girls live there
 unke hisaab se yah kaaphi kam he
 SPA students said that cleanliness was in bad shape
 andolan ke dauraan unhone is kachare ko saaf kar jamaa kar diya
 Students say that mosquitoes rule the campus due to which many students have dengue
 puraane cooler kaa kabad yahaan jamaa he
 By the way, you go to the mohallas of Delhi, old cars and scooters are frozen as junk
 koi hataane vaala nahin he
 The condition of the campus is also similar
 espie dimd uniwarsity he
 Here too, there are not as many teachers as there should be
 aankade bataate hai ki manzur padon kii tulana main kam shikshak hai or shikshakon kii sankhya kam hi hoti ja rahi he
 In 2014, 32 positions were approved for professors, 29 were professors
 2014 se lekar 2016 tak yah sankhya 29 se kam hokar 23 par pahunch gai
 In 2014, 44 posts of Associate Professor were approved but 30 were working
 2014 main 30 associat professor the or 2016 main 31, yani 13 kii kami he
 There is also a shortage of teachers in the School of Planning and Architects
 ab chalate hai rajasthan
 The system here uses one word, work arrangement
 kaary vyavasthaarth kaa matlab yah hua ki aap college a main padhaate hai or college ba main teacher nahin he to aapako teen maheene ke liye college ba main bhej diya jayega
 But the college a teacher got so upset that he got a stay from the court
 to ab nayaa tarika nikaala gaya he
 Send the lecturer to another college for 15 days
 isi system ko kaary vyavasthaarth kehete hai
 There is also work in it, system is also there, it is also real and it is also meaning sab milakar banate hai kaary vyavasthaarth yani samasya saakshaat
 The Government of Rajasthan has issued the order on 21 October
 aadesh jari karne vaali sanstha kaa naam he ayuktalay college shiksha, rajasthan, jaipur
 The entire chart is made in this order
 bataaya gaya he ki kis college se teacher ko kis college main 15 din ke liye bheja jayega
 According to this order, two teachers will be sent alternately for 15 days in a teacher-less college
 donon par zimmedaari hogi ki 30 dinon ke bheetar paathyakram puraa karne kaa prayaas karenge
 Only after informing the principal will he leave for his native college
 30 dinon main course puraa karne ke liye 279 shikshakon kaa chayan kiya gaya he
 Can two teachers together complete any course in 30 days? Churan is being sold openly to make India a world guru
 ye idia chuuran hi he kyonki 30 din main paathyakram puraa karne ke kamaal kii ummid bharat ke hi shikshakon se hi kii ja sakati he
 From where these teachers will be removed for 15-15 days, then the subject will stop
 isse rajasthan ke ek college main ek saal main course puraa hoga or ek saal main 30 din
 This is an amazing idea
 aap dekh rahe hai ragadrabari, college sarkari or chaatr tarkari
 But on this list, it was known that where there are zero teachers
 chaumahala rajkeey mahavidhyalay main bhugol kaa koi teacher nahin he
 There is no Sanskrit teacher in Manoharathana Government College
 manoharthana mahavidhyalay main samajashaastra main bhi koi teacher nahin he
 Khanpur Government College has zero teachers in History, Geography, Sociology
 samasya kaa samaadhaan yahi hoga ki shikshakon kii sthaayee niyukti kii jaae
 Till exportable teachers are not ready, then these vacant positions can be filled only by import
 is suchi main kai shaharon ke naam hai jinka uccharan tivi par nahin hota he
 Such as Khetri, Jhadoul, Kekri
 yahaan ke rajkeey collejon ke kai vishyon main zero teacher hai
 This list shows that there is a lot of emphasis on the posting of Sanskrit teachers in many colleges
 akhir sanskrit kaa apmaan, nahin sahegaa hindustan tip naare deevaaron par likhane se pehle kuch to karke dikhaanaa hi hoga
 Sanskrit teachers are being sent for 30 days
 jab teacher nahin the tab bhi sanskrit ke saath mazaaq ho rahaa tha, ab jah 30 din main course puraa karaane kaa prayaas karenge to yah mazaaq nahin, laughter chalange hoga
 It is written in the order that the fare to be paid will be paid
 15 din thaharne, khaane pine ke bare main aadesh spasht nahin he
 The status of guest teacher is not good
 15-15 dinon ke liye bheje jane kaa yah idia nayaa he kyonki pehle teen teen maheene ke liye shikshak bheje jate the to iske khilaaf shikshak court chale gaye or ste le aae
 To avoid this, a laughter challenge has come to complete the course in 15 days
 jafar multani ne madhya pradesh ke agar malwa se guest shikshakon kii ek samasya kii taraf dhyaan khinchne ke liye story bheji he
 You know that the guest teacher in Madhya Pradesh is called a guest scholar
 is hisaab se vahaan ke permanent teacher ko vidwaan samajha jaataa he yaa nahin, pataa nahin
 The guest as well as the scholar, will hear that they are more interested
 magar sabase zyaada shoshan inhen kaa hota he
 If you compile the terminology nomenclature used to hire teachers in colleges, then the entire book will be made
 yahaan ke shaskeey nehru mahavidhyalay main atithi vidwaan namita 70 kimi dur se padhaane aati he
 Namita has been a university topper
 kuch dinon pehle namita kaa utaras kii surgery hui thi
 The government rules that no guest scholar can take seven consecutive days off
 saat dinon se zyaada avkaash legaa to kaary mukt kar diya jayega yani hataa diya jayega
 Namita also traveled to surgery to save her job and kept coming to college
 vaise bhi jo selary milti he wo car ke petrol par hi karch ho jaati he
 Think about how much leave a female guest scholar will get when she becomes a mother
 hamane pataa kiya to bataaya gaya ki atithi vidwaan ko matternity live maatrutiv avkaash kii paatrata nahin he
 You did not feel fond of, did not engage in English, then it was not surprising in Hindi
 yahi nahin atithi vidwaan ke liye bhi zaruri he ki ve seminar main jaaen, paper pragent karen magar jab ve jate hai to vetan cat jaataa he
 When a permanent teacher goes, his salary is not deducted
 aapako iske peeche kaa tark samaj aayaa
 Now come to Mumbai University
 iske itihaas main pehali baar vaais chancelar ko barkhaast kiya gaya he

 This is not true VC payalat kaa karcha bachaane kii sochi
 If the CBI, ED, by the work of fixing the opposition

 The opposition accuses these investigative agencies that they are behind them, not anyone else
 vaise big braking news yahi he ki vishvavidhyalay main aircraft kareedne kaa prastaav paas nahin hua
 The comments is bich dobaaraa kapi check karaane kii maang karne vaale chaatro ne maidan badal diya he
 Now they have come out of university grounds to Azad Maidan
 dobaaraa pariksha kii fees vruddhi se naaraaz hai
 The fee of Rs 500 has been increased to Rs 1050
 sochie sanjay deshmukh ne jahaaz kareed liya hota to gazab ho jaataa
 Children would run on the streets of Mumbai carrying banners and laughing while flying ships over VC sea
 yahuu yahuu karte rahe
 Students still perform
 sanvida par, theke par, anshkalik padhaane vaale teacher to pradarshan bhi nahin kar sakate hai

 The institute is facing budget cuts even after being on the priority list
 2013-14 main espie kaa bajet praavdhaan tha 45 karod magar mila 28 karod
 SPA budget provision in 2014-15 was 46 crores but got 30 crores
 2015-16 main espie kaa bajet praavdhaan tha 40 karod magar mila 26 karod
 You see how the budget is getting less

 There should be a doctor in college but there is not

 The girls hostel has only eight toilets on one floor while sixty girls live there

 Here too, there are not as many teachers as there should be
 aankade bataate hai ki manzur padon kii tulana main kam shikshak hai or shikshakon kii sankhya kam hi hoti ja rahi he

 The system here uses one word, work arrangement

 But the college a teacher got so upset that he got a stay from the court

 Send the lecturer to another college for 15 days
 isi system ko kaary vyavasthaarth kehete hai
 There is also work in it, there is also arrangement, it is also real and it is also meaning

 The Government of Rajasthan has issued the order on 21 October

 Only after informing the principal will he leave for his native college
 30 dinon main course puraa karne ke liye 279 shikshakon kaa chayan kiya gaya he
 Can two teachers together complete any course in 30 days? Churan is being sold openly to make India a world guru

 From where these teachers will be removed for 15-15 days, then the subject will stop
 isse rajasthan ke ek college main ek saal main course puraa hoga or ek saal main 30 din
 This is an amazing idea
 aap dekh rahe hai ragadrabari, college sarkari or chaatr tarkari
 But on this list, it was known that where there are zero teachers
 chaumahala rajkeey mahavidhyalay main bhugol kaa koi teacher nahin he
 There is no Sanskrit teacher in Manoharathana Government College
 manoharthana mahavidhyalay main samajashaastra main bhi koi teacher nahin he
 Khanpur Government College has zero teachers in History, Geography, Sociology
 samasya kaa samaadhaan yahi hoga ki shikshakon kii sthaayee niyukti kii jaae
 Till exportable teachers are not ready, then these vacant positions can be filled only by import
 is suchi main kai shaharon ke naam hai jinka uccharan tivi par nahin hota he
 Such as Khetri, Jhadoul, Kekri
 yahaan ke rajkeey collejon ke kai vishyon main zero teacher hai
 This list shows that there is a lot of emphasis on the posting of Sanskrit teachers in many colleges

 Sanskrit teachers are being sent for 30 days
 jab teacher nahin the tab bhi sanskrit ke saath mazaaq ho rahaa tha, ab jah 30 din main course puraa karaane kaa prayaas karenge to yah mazaaq nahin, laughter chalange hoga
 It is written in the order that the fare to be paid will be paid
 15 din thaharne, khaane pine ke bare main aadesh spasht nahin he
 The status of guest teacher is not good

 To avoid this, a laughter challenge has come to complete the course in 15 days

 i wish this news was wrong
 hawaii jahaaz kareedne ke saath ye udaana bhi chaahate the
 This is not true VC payalat kaa karcha bachaane kii sochi
 If the CBI, ED, by the work of fixing the opposition
 iskar vibhaag kuch ghante ke liye free ho to sanjay deshmukh se bhi mil aana chahie
 The opposition accuses these investigative agencies that they are behind them, not anyone else

 Children would run on the streets of Mumbai carrying banners and laughing while flying ships over VC sea
 yahuu yahuu karte rahe
 Students still perform
 sanvida par, theke par, anshkalik padhaane vaale teacher to pradarshan bhi nahin kar sakate hai
 We are teaching less than the minimum wage, we cannot get leave if we are ill, we are going to college in Bukhar, and you are killing us by making us laugh that we are going to become world gurus
 brake le lijie broken system kaa ek or namoona dikhaaungaa, bharat main krabian or shmashaan ko lekar sirf sampradayik raajnneeti hi nahin ho sakati he, logon ne sabit kar diya he ki ve is maamle main ghotaalaa bhi kar sakate hai
 You see how the budget is getting less
 iskaa asar yahaan kii buniyadi suvidhaon par pad rahaa he
 There should be a doctor in college but there is not
 dawa bhi uplabdh nahin he
 The girls hostel has only eight toilets on one floor while sixty girls live there
 unke hisaab se yah kaaphi kam he
 SPA students said that cleanliness was in bad shape
 andolan ke dauraan unhone is kachare ko saaf kar jamaa kar diya
 Students say that mosquitoes rule the campus due to which many students have dengue
 puraane cooler kaa kabad yahaan jamaa he
 By the way, you go to the mohallas of Delhi, old cars and scooters are frozen as junk
 koi hataane vaala nahin he
 The condition of the campus is also similar
 espie dimd uniwarsity he
 Here too, there are not as many teachers as there should be
 aankade bataate hai ki manzur padon kii tulana main kam shikshak hai or shikshakon kii sankhya kam hi hoti ja rahi he
 In 2014, 32 positions were approved for professors, 29 were professors
 2014 se lekar 2016 tak yah sankhya 29 se kam hokar 23 par pahunch gai
 In 2014, 44 posts of Associate Professor were approved but 30 were working
 2014 main 30 associat professor the or 2016 main 31, yani 13 kii kami he
 There is also a shortage of teachers in the School of Planning and Architects
 ab chalate hai rajasthan
 The system here uses one word, work arrangement
 kaary vyavasthaarth kaa matlab yah hua ki aap college a main padhaate hai or college ba main teacher nahin he to aapako teen maheene ke liye college ba main bhej diya jayega
 But the college a teacher got so upset that he got a stay from the court
 to ab nayaa tarika nikaala gaya he
 Send the lecturer to another college for 15 days
 isi system ko kaary vyavasthaarth kehete hai
 There is also work in it, system is also there, it is also real and it is also meaning sab milakar banate hai kaary vyavasthaarth yani samasya saakshaat
 The Government of Rajasthan has issued the order on 21 October
 aadesh jari karne vaali sanstha kaa naam he ayuktalay college shiksha, rajasthan, jaipur
 The entire chart is made in this order
 bataaya gaya he ki kis college se teacher ko kis college main 15 din ke liye bheja jayega
 According to this order, two teachers will be sent alternately for 15 days in a teacher-less college
 donon par zimmedaari hogi ki 30 dinon ke bheetar paathyakram puraa karne kaa prayaas karenge
 Only after informing the principal will he leave for his native college
 30 dinon main course puraa karne ke liye 279 shikshakon kaa chayan kiya gaya he
 Can two teachers together complete any course in 30 days? Churan is being sold openly to make India a world guru
 ye idia chuuran hi he kyonki 30 din main paathyakram puraa karne ke kamaal kii ummid bharat ke hi shikshakon se hi kii ja sakati he
 From where these teachers will be removed for 15-15 days, then the subject will stop
 isse rajasthan ke ek college main ek saal main course puraa hoga or ek saal main 30 din
 This is an amazing idea
 aap dekh rahe hai ragadrabari, college sarkari or chaatr tarkari
 But on this list, it was known that where there are zero teachers
 chaumahala rajkeey mahavidhyalay main bhugol kaa koi teacher nahin he
 There is no Sanskrit teacher in Manoharathana Government College
 manoharthana mahavidhyalay main samajashaastra main bhi koi teacher nahin he
 Khanpur Government College has zero teachers in History, Geography, Sociology
 samasya kaa samaadhaan yahi hoga ki shikshakon kii sthaayee niyukti kii jaae
 Till exportable teachers are not ready, then these vacant positions can be filled only by import
 is suchi main kai shaharon ke naam hai jinka uccharan tivi par nahin hota he
 Such as Khetri, Jhadoul, Kekri
 yahaan ke rajkeey collejon ke kai vishyon main zero teacher hai
 This list shows that there is a lot of emphasis on the posting of Sanskrit teachers in many colleges
 akhir sanskrit kaa apmaan, nahin sahegaa hindustan tip naare deevaaron par likhane se pehle kuch to karke dikhaanaa hi hoga
 Sanskrit teachers are being sent for 30 days
 jab teacher nahin the tab bhi sanskrit ke saath mazaaq ho rahaa tha, ab jah 30 din main course puraa karaane kaa prayaas karenge to yah mazaaq nahin, laughter chalange hoga
 It is written in the order that the fare to be paid will be paid
 15 din thaharne, khaane pine ke bare main aadesh spasht nahin he
 The status of guest teacher is not good
 15-15 dinon ke liye bheje jane kaa yah idia nayaa he kyonki pehle teen teen maheene ke liye shikshak bheje jate the to iske khilaaf shikshak court chale gaye or ste le aae
 To avoid this, a laughter challenge has come to complete the course in 15 days
 jafar multani ne madhya pradesh ke agar malwa se guest shikshakon kii ek samasya kii taraf dhyaan khinchne ke liye story bheji he
 You know that the guest teacher in Madhya Pradesh is called a guest scholar
 is hisaab se vahaan ke permanent teacher ko vidwaan samajha jaataa he yaa nahin, pataa nahin
 The guest as well as the scholar, will hear that they are more interested
 magar sabase zyaada shoshan inhen kaa hota he
 If you compile the terminology nomenclature used to hire teachers in colleges, then the entire book will be made
 yahaan ke shaskeey nehru mahavidhyalay main atithi vidwaan namita 70 kimi dur se padhaane aati he
 Namita has been a university topper
 kuch dinon pehle namita kaa utaras kii surgery hui thi
 The government rules that no guest scholar can take seven consecutive days off
 saat dinon se zyaada avkaash legaa to kaary mukt kar diya jayega yani hataa diya jayega
 Namita also traveled to surgery to save her job and kept coming to college
 vaise bhi jo selary milti he wo car ke petrol par hi karch ho jaati he
 Think about how much leave a female guest scholar will get when she becomes a mother
 hamane pataa kiya to bataaya gaya ki atithi vidwaan ko matternity live maatrutiv avkaash kii paatrata nahin he
 You did not feel fond of, did not engage in English, then it was not surprising in Hindi
 yahi nahin atithi vidwaan ke liye bhi zaruri he ki ve seminar main jaaen, paper pragent karen magar jab ve jate hai to vetan cat jaataa he
 When a permanent teacher goes, his salary is not deducted
 aapako iske peeche kaa tark samaj aayaa
 Now come to Mumbai University
 iske itihaas main pehali baar vaais chancelar ko barkhaast kiya gaya he
 Sanjay Deshmukh, who has got his name recorded in history, kept making history in some other cases
 artiai kaaryakarta anil galgali ne yah khulaasa kiya he ki sanjay deshmukh visi banane se pehle 2015 main elelbi kii pariksha main fail ho gaye the
 Even after this, he was made the VC of the University of 774 colleges
 times of india ne likhaa he ki ve aresas ke kareebi hai
 The RSS should distance itself from Sanjay Deshmukh as Anil Galgali has revealed that Sanjay Deshmukh has made record overseas trips during his tenure
 hamaare sahyogi sohit mishra ne bataaya ki unhone 100 karod kii fiks dipazit tod di
 It is also being learned that the Vice Chancellor had wanted to buy the plane with the money of the students
 hawaii jahaaz
 Our Vice Chancellors ruined the university but they will be the first who dreamed of buying a plane after the ruin
 agar yah sahi he to visi banane se pehle likhva lenaa chahie ki main niyukt karne vaale ke raajnneetik agenda ko chalaate hue uniwarsity ko jald se jald barbaad kar duungaa magar uske paise se hawaii jahaaz nahin kharidoongaa

 iskar vibhaag kuch ghante ke liye free ho to sanjay deshmukh se bhi mil aana chahie
