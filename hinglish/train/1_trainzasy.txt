 This unexpected step by the Reserve Bank has been taken due to poor performance of Axis Bank and continuously deteriorating asset quality
 exis bank kii report ke mutabik shikha sharma ke ek saal ke kaarykaal ke dauraan board bank ke liye nae siio kii talash karegaa

 But at the present time when private and state-run banks of the country are in debt, Axis Bank's profits and asset quality are steadily declining

 On August 21, 2014, when the terrorist organization ISIS released a video of beheading American journalist James Foley, the whole world was shocked
 kisi begunaah ko yun maut dene kii iesas kii ye pehali tasviir thi
 This was followed by another photo
 phir teesri or chauthi
 And now that fifth picture has also arrived, with which everyone was shocked
 is paanchaven or nae video main yues aid ke ek kaaryakarta peter cassing kaa sir kalam karte dikhaaya gaya he
 When and where this process of stabbing a knife in the neck of humanity will end, no one knows at the moment
 aatankwaadiyon ne aakhirkaar apni us dhamkee ko sahi sabit kar diya, jo 3 oktober ko british bandhak alen hanning kaa sir kalam kiye jane ke dauraan di thi
 Like all other incidents of beheading earlier, this time a masked terrorist in black clothes is shown holding Cassing
 cassing naarangi kapadon main ghutane ke bal baitha he, jabaki haath main chaaku liya aatankwaadi peeche khadaa najar aata he
 This terrorist first speaks English in British accent, opposes the attacks on ISIS in Iraq and then beheads Cassing, warning the US and Britain
 haalanki is baar america jaanch agency epabiai ne nakaabposh antkavaadi ko pahchaan lene kaa daawa kiya he, vahiin bhi mana ja rahaa he ki ye vaardaat uttari syria ke dabik ilaake main anjaam di gai
 Cassing is not alone in the video
 Cassing is not alone this time in this video, but before that the terrorists are shown beheading around 12 Iraqi soldiers
 maut ke is nanga naach se pehle bhi aatankwaadi america or britain ko chetate hai or america phogiyon ko bhi isi tareeke se maut ke ghat utaarne kii dhamkee dete hue phogiyon kaa sir utaarne main lag jate hai
 While the international community is busy re-examining this latest video released by ISIS, almost all the world is believing that Peter Cassing is watching the video released and the murder
 Is no longer in this world
 america ke indiana polis ilaake ke rahanevaale 26 saal ke peter cassing ko iesas ke aatankwaadiyon ne pichley saal tab agava kar liya tha, jab wo yues aid kii taraf se turki main syrian visthapiton kii madad kar rahaa tha
 After this, like other hostages, the families of Cassingh also requested to spare their son
 kya he jihadi jon kaa salmerica patrkaar james phole se lekar yues aid kaaryakarta peter cassing tak
 In the anonymous ISIS locations, the hands of one who beheaded innocents one after another
 aakhir wo haath kiske hai? koun he wo nakaabposh jo haath main khanjar liye camere ke saamne sir kalam karata ja rahaa he? sutron kii maane to uskaa naam jihadi jon he
 But now the news is coming that John has been badly injured in an air strike and is on the verge of death
 duniya ko hilaa dene vaali in tasveeron main katane vaala sir har baar beshak kisi nae insaan kaa tha, lekin kaatanevaale ye haath har baar ek hi shaks ke rahe
 The realignment of the worldwide infamous jihadist John came to the fore for the first time when ISIS beheaded journalist James Foley for the first time on August 21 in connection with killing innocents and warning the US and Britain Released video of Jaane
 darasal, is video se pehle jihadi jon ne iesas par kiye ja rahe hamalon kaa virodh kiya
 But despite having a mask on his face, the security agencies recognized him with his voice and English-speaking style
 camerun kii jinda pakadaney kii chaahatjihadi jon ke jakhmi hone kii khabaron ke bich british pradhan mantri david camerun main jon ko jinda pakadaney kii apni khwaahish kaa ek baar phir se izhaar kiya he
 Cameron has said that in view of the way Jihadi John has been killing innocent people, it is more important to be caught and presented in a court of law than to kill him
 taaki use uske har gunaah kii sahi tareeke se sajaa mil sake
 Cameron's statement came after reports of a large number of hard-core youth from Britain leaving Iraq to join ISIS were reported
 haalanki khud britain kii sarkaar ne is baat kii pushti kii he or kaha he ki ab tak takreeban 500 british noujvaan iesas main shaamil hone ke liye chori chhipe iraq or syria ke liye ravaanaa ho chuke hai
 Prime Minister Cameron has warned the boys, including such youngsters, to aspire to become terrorists, saying that the consequences of doing so would surely be bad
 camere par sir kalam karne vaale haath beshak jihadi jon ke hon, lekin khanjar uthaane kaa hukum hameshaa bagdadi hi detaa he
 Baghdadi means the leader of the world's richest terrorist organization
 alqaida ke chif al javaahari ke baad duniya kaa most wanted aatankwaadi
 Read further, what is the real motive of Baghdadi
 
 
 bagdadi kaa asal maksabalqaeda ke chif al javaahari ke baad duniya ke is most wanted aatankwaadi kii jo sabase badi pahchaan he, wo yahi ki use poshida rahanaa hi pasand he
 But even after staying behind the mask, the person is shocked to hear about the murder-o-garrat which he has done so far
 16 may 2010 ko iesas ke mukhiya ke taur par duniya ke is sabase amir aatankwaadi sanghathan kii kaman sanbhalanevaala bagdadi pehle se alqaida ke commander osma bin laden kaa mureed rahaa he
 He wants to avenge the death of al-qaeda's mentor
 bagdadi kaa pehla makasadabagadadi apane khatarnaak mansoobey main kamyaabi paane ke liye pehle to iraq or syria par kabja karnaa chahta he or sach ye he ki wo apane is makasad main kaaphi had tak kaamyaab bhi ho chukaa he
 Its fighters have captured parts of Syria and at the same time, many cities of Iraq have also been under ISIS terrorist occupation
 bagdadi kaa doosraa makasadabagadadi kaa doosraa makasad sirf or sirf iraq or syria ko jeetna nahin he balki wo to tamaam levent mulkon yani cyprus, isroyal, jordan, lebanon, syria, philistin or turki ko milakar ek islamic emirate bananaa chahta he
 Baghdadi's third motive: Baghdadi's dream does not remain here until Mahmud
 wo in mulkon par kabja karne ke baad pakistan or afghanistan par kabja or phir apana samrajya hindustan main gujarat samet uttar pashchami rajyon tak failaana chahta he
 According to experts, Baghdadi wants to become the Islamic State of Khorasan and if Abu Bakr al Baghdadi succeeds in its cause, the world map will surely change
 lekin chaunkaane vaali baat ye he ki bharat ke kaaphi aatankwaadi iesas main shaamil ho chuke hai
 a few months ago, the Syrian ambassador has also revealed that the jihadis of India have joined the war against the Bashar government in their country and if this is true then one thing is certain that in the time to come ISIS India Can also pose a major threat to ye abu bakar al bagdadi hi he, jisaki aguwai main iesas ke aatankwaadiyon ne naa sirf iraq ke duusare bade shahar mosul ko apane kabje main kar liya, balki isi silsile main mosul ke central bank ko lut kar is duniya kii sabade badi bank lut kaa itihaas bhi apane naam kar liya

 yues state department ne abu bakar al bagdadi ke sir par yaa uskaa pataa dene vaale ko 10 million yues dollar ke inaam kaa elaan kar rakhaa he
 This amount is the second highest amount of US $ 25 million after Al Qaeda's new chief, Al Jawahri

 shanivaar ko lakhanu ke janeshwar mishra park main samaajawaadee party ke rajat jayanti samaaroh kaa makasad tha party ke 25 saal puure hone kaa utsav manaanaa
 Lakhs of people gathered in the festival, leaders like former Prime Minister Deve Gowda, Ajit Singh, Abhay Chautala, Lalu Yadav, Sharad Yadav and Ram Jethmalani also converged, but the silver jubilee celebrations turned into a panchayat for reconciliation between uncle and nephew
 sulah ke liye tamaam netaaon kii naseehat kaa zyada kuch asar hota nahin dikhaa
 At the behest of Lalu Yadav, Akhilesh Yadav touched the feet of uncle Shivpal Yadav, but at that time, the soles were glowing in the hands of both, who were presented to him on stage
 chachaa shivpal yadav apane man kii bhadaas khub nikaali or kaha ki party ko yahaan tak laane main unki qurbaani or unke tyaag kaa koi muqabla nahin he
 Being emotional, Shivpal Yadav also said that he does not aspire to become the Chief Minister and is ready to give his blood if needed
 yah bhi kah diya ki akhilesh yadav kii sarkaar main kuch chaapluus log satta kaa majaa uthaa rahe hai, jabaki tamaam sangharsh karne vaale logon ko kuch nahin mila
 When Akhilesh Yadav's turn came to speak, he gave the correct answer, but only in short words
 shivpal yadav kaa naam liye bina kah diya ki kuch logon ko samaj to aegi lekin tab tak party lut chuki hogi
 Shivpal Yadav said that he would keep working for the party as often as he was sacked and insulted by him as much as he would like to be dismissed
 akhilesh yadav nemuskuraate hue jawaab diya ki samaajawaadee log unhen talwaar bhent to karte hai lekin ummid karte hai ki talwaar chale nahin
 How can this happen
 khachaakhach bhare pandal ke bich bhi netaaon kii gutbaji saaf dikh rahi thi
 Supporters of Shivpal and Akhilesh were sitting in separate flocks and were fighting slogans to raise the flag of their leader
 alam yah tha ki jab shivpal yadav kehete the vah party ke liye qurbaani dene ko taiyaar hai, to akhilesh yadav ke samarthak samarthak naare lagaate the, 'akhilesh bhaiya tere naam yah javaani he qurbaan'
 Shivpal was not able to stop the clapping and shouting slogans in the name of Akhilesh, but he left no stone unturned to keep his bully on the stage
 jab mike par akhilesh ke rajyamantri javed abdi ko mauka mila, to unhone buland aawaaj main akhilesh yadav kii shaan main kaside padhanaa shuru kar diya
 When the crowd started cheering, Uncle Shivpal became so red-yellow that Javed Abdi was pushed away and came on the mic and scolded supporters for disciplining him
 devegoda, lalu yadav se lekar ajit singh sabane samaajawaadee party ko ekajute hokar sampradayik takaton se muqabla karne kii naseehat di
 It also said that everyone under the leadership of Netaji is ready to come together to prevent the BJP from hoisting the flag on UP
 lekin jab ant menmulaayam singh yadavabolane aae, to parivaar or party main mache ghamaasan ke bajaae ateet ke galiyaaron main apni puraani yaadon ke saath bhatakate hue dikhe
 Instead of the crisis facing the party, he spoke more of his experience with socialist leaders ranging from Jawaharlal Nehru, Ram Manohar Lohia and Raj Narayan
 do dinon pehle rathyatra main akhilesh yadav ne apni lokapriyata dikhaai thi, to rajat jayanti samaaroh main pradesh adhyaksh ke taur parashivpal yadav nipani takat dikhaai
 The crowd came above a million, but no one saw the path of reconciliation in the party
 logon ko dikhaa to sirf itnaa ki lakhanu ke sabase vishaal or sabase khubasurat janeshwar mishra park main raily khatm hone ke baad har taraf gandagi kaa ambara tha
 The trampled plants may be wondering why they are paying for the party's pride

 ) puure saat saal ho gaye nirbhaya cese ko
 It was 16 December 2012
 aaj 17 disambar 2019 he
 Nirbhaya's culprits could not reach their end in these seven long years
 alabatta somvaar ko unnav rape maamle main vidhayak kuldeep senger ko dilli kii ek adaalat ne rape or apharan kaa doshi jarur qaraar de diya
 Now the sentence will be announced on Tuesday
 par nirbhaya cese kaa kya hoga? aakhir nirbhaya ke gunahagaaron kii faansee kahaan lataki he
 So, on the occasion of completion of seven years of the Nirbhaya case, let us see the account of these seven years
 16 disambar 2012 se 17 disambar 2019kahaan to tab aisa lag rahaa tha ki bas ab insaaf hua ki tab insaaf hua
 Things were happening that all of them would be hanged within a year
 magar saal dar saal bitta gaya
 The seventh year has come
 shaayad ye saal bhi biit jaataa
 What to know wo to hyderabad kii doctor or unnav kii us ladki ne ek baar phir desh ko gussa dilaayaa tab jaakar hamen yaad aayaa ki are nirbhaya ke gunahagaaron kii to ab tak faansee nahin hui he
 Just remembering what was there, now hanging, methods of hanging, law of hanging, date of hanging, rope of hanging, hanging noose all started talking
 kyon laga itnaa vaktanirbhaya cese kis raftaar se aage badha, pichley saat saalon main kab kya hua
 It is necessary to examine it year after year
 jaruri he ki is vakt cese kis mode par khadaa he
 What will happen next kab tak faansee hogi
 What date can be hanged kis din blike warrant jari hoga
 Know and understand these legal aspects
 philhal nirbhaya ke chaaron gunahagaar yani mukesh, pawan, akshay or vinay kii faansee ke bich paanch kanoonee adchane hai
 The mother of the first legal obstructionist filed a petition in Patiala House Court in October this year regarding the delay in hanging
 us yachika par sunwaayee karte hue patiala house adaalat ne tihaad jail ke diji ko notice jari kar chaaron kaidiyon ke cese kii taaja report maangi
 After interacting with the four convicts through video conferencing on December 13, the court has set the next date of hearing on December 18
 duusari kanoonee adchandusri aadchan ye he ki 10 disambar ko ek or gunahagaar akshay ne supreme court main faansee kii sajaa ko lekar rivyuu pitishan daakhil kar diya tha
 The Supreme Court has given time to hear the petition on December 17 at 2 pm
 teesri kanoonee adchanatisari aadchan ye he ki 17 disambar ko supreme court kaa faisla aane ke baad bhi 18 disambar ko patiala court main sunwaayee hogi
 The Patiala House Court can then pass a judgment on the further rights of the prisoners
 chauthi kanoonee adchanachauthi aadchan ye he ki mukesh or pawan kahin adaalat ke saamne kah den ki wo bhi raashtrapati se raham kii apil karenge to bahut mumkin he ki unhen bhi ye mauka mil jaae
 This may delay the hanging for a few more days
 haalanki ye bhi ho saktaa he ki 18 disambar ko adaalat ye saaf kar de ki itane vakt tak aap logon ne raashtrapati se raham kii apil kyon nahin kii? or is binah par uski arji naamanzoor kar de
 Or it may be that the other two do not go to the President for mercy
 aisi surat main bahut mumkin he ki chaaron ko jaldi faansee de di jaae
 But it will soon take a week or two
 paanchavin kanoonee aadchan2014 ke supreme court ke ek faisle ke tahat dayaa yachika khaarij hone or blike warrant jari hone par bhi fouran faansee nahin di ja sakati
 The Supreme Court states that a person who is hanged after a black warrant is issued, should be given at least 14 days
 taaki is dauraan wo apane saare adhure kaam jinamein vasiyat karne se lekar rishtedaaron se milanaa shaamil he, wo sab puri kar sake
 According to this, hanging will take at least one to two weeks
 vaise ye sari kanoonee adchane to abhi ke liye or abhi kii hai
 Now the question arises that in a case like Nirbhaya in which the fast track court gave its verdict within just nine months
 uske baad bhi faansee dene main saat saal kyon lag gaye?is cese kaa ek or ajeeb pahalu he
 Now is it a coincidence or is there a conspiracy to postpone the hanging date behind it
 nirbhaya ke chaaron gunahagaron ne abhi tak apane aakhri kanoonee adhikaar yaa raham kii apil ke maanviya adhikaar kaa istemaal hi nahin kiya he
 If one did not file a review petition, the other did not appeal to Rahm
 ek ne to donon main se ab tak kuch bhi nahin kiya
 The first verdict of the Nirbhaya case was heard by Fast Track Court in just 9 months i
e
 in 2013
 iske baad dilli hai court ne bhi bahut zyada vakt nahin liya
 The decision came from the High Court in a year
 alabatta supreme court ne jarur kareeb sava teen saal liye faisla sunaane main
 But after that, nothing had happened in this case in the last two years
 shanivaar or ravivaar kii chuttee hoti he lihaaja shuukravaar shaam hote hi puraa paris sadakon par utar aata he
 Last Friday, about one and a half thousand people were listening to the American band at a musical concert

 The drummer and other artists were performing on stage
 abhi sirf mujeec kaa hi shor sunai de rahaa tha ki phir achaanak sangeet ke shor ke saath-saath kuch nai aawaaj sunai deen
 The sound of this music was not sure, but before anyone could understand this voice, suddenly on seeing the drummer performing on the stage in front of people, he fell on the stage due to being shot
 saamne aae video ko dekh kar ye saaf ho jaataa he ki concert haul main aatankwaadiyon ne stage ke peeche se entry kii or sabase pehle unhone stage par parform kar rahe kalakaaron ko hi goliyaan maarin
 After this, as soon as he came on stage, he opened the gun in front of the audience and fired indiscriminately until the magazine was empty

 It is being said that this car has been used by the terrorists during the attack
 aath aatankwaadiyon ne do alag-alag kaaron main savaar hokar paris ke alag-alag ilaake main fail kar katleam kiya
 With the help of these two cars, the French police are trying to reach all the people who helped these terrorists in the attack or sheltered them in Paris

 Police are investigating whether the man was involved in the Paris attack
 hamale ke baad se paris police kii aatankiyon par kaabo paane kii ranneeti behad chust rahi he

 The vehicle was with a French citizen living in Belgium
 police ko ek duusari gaadi kii talash he jiskaa istemaal do jagah par hamale main kiya gaya tha
 However, the question remains as to why the French intelligence agencies were not already aware of the attack by terrorists

 team india ke 500wein test kaa pehla din
 Obviously it had to be special
 kanpur ke green park maidan par barish kii ashankaon ke bich yah aitihaasik match bilkul samay par shuru hua
 The excitement of the audience was at its peak
 bisisiai ne match ko khaas banane ke liye khaas intjaam kiye the
 Many captains of Indian Test cricket history were also honored on the occasion
 iske baad shuru hua yah khaas match jiskaa darshak besabri se intjaar kar rahe the
 If we look at the first day's play, it was mixed for Team India
 haalanki din ke nirdhaarit 90 over main usne 3
 291 for 9 wickets with a runrate of 23, which is a decent score in a sense
 phir bhi darshakon ke chahete viraat kohli ne unako niraash kiya
 Kohli had the chance to make the match more memorable after Pujara was dismissed for 154 in the 49th over, but he returned to the pavilion with Vijay adding 13 runs
 unhone shuruyaat acchhee kii thi
 Two fours were also hit, but could not take the innings further
 unase pehle test or tii-20 donon main ab tak shandaar khel dikhaane vaale openar lokesh rahul ne teji se ran banaae, lekin is baar badi pari nahin khel paae
 He scored 32 runs in 39 balls
 din ke khel kaa aakarshan murali vijay or cheteshwar pujaara kii paariyaan raheen
 Significantly, the discussion about the location of both these players was in full swing
 windies main ham iskaa najaara dekh chuke the, jab kohli ne vijay kii jagah out of form shikhar dhawan ko plaing ilevan main lenaa behatar samajha tha or pujaara kii jagah rohit sharma ko mahatv diya tha
 However, after being criticized, where he dropped Dhawan in Kanpur, Rohit could not escape Sharma's fascination and took four bowlers instead of five and kept Rohit
 vijay or pujaara donon ne dhime or mushkil dikh rahe wicket par apni clasical batting kaa najaara pesh kiya or amit chhap chhodte hue captain ke pehle ke faislon ko galat sabit kar diya
 Vijay faced 170 balls and scored 65 runs, while Pujara scored 62 runs in 109 balls
 gendon kii sankhya bataati he ki donon ne hi ballebaajon ne test main paramparaagat khel dikhaaya or takneekee rup se daksh hone kaa saboot diya
 On the other hand, Rohit Sharma started off as usual and added 35 runs, but then his well-known carefree shot came and he kept going
 matlab rohit ek baar phir jamane ke baad wicket phenk baithe
 His weakness has been criticized, because there is no doubt about his talent
 haa, aar aswin ne ek baar phir balle se chamak dikhaai or 40 ran banaate hue nichle madhyakram main team ko raahat pahunchaai, kyonki newjiland ke gendbaaj bich-bich main haaavee hote dikhe
 The comments newjiland ke gendbaaji kii baat karen, to unke spinneron ne acchhee gendbaaji kii or bhartiya ballebaajon kii pariksha lee
 There were also many close cases
 khaastaur se spinner michel santner ne khaasaa pareshaan kiya
 Light dust also appeared on the Kanpur wicket
 santner ne iskaa phayda bhi uthaaya or bharat ke shuruaati do wicket jatke
 He had 3 wickets in 20 overs on the first day
 duusare chor se bharat main janme ish sodhi ne unka acha saath diya
 However, he could take only one wicket
 antim satr main trent bolt ne shandaar tej gendbaaji kaa najaara pesh kiya or 3 wicket jhatak liye
 Bolt used inswing as well as slow balls, which the Indian batsmen could not read
 kul milakar pehle din team india ne ummid ke anuroop khel nahin dikhaaya or bade lakshya se peeche dikh rahi he
 In such a situation, New Zealand has a chance to put pressure on India by doing better in batting
 krij abhi rabindra jadeja or umesh yadav hai
 
 
 It remains to be seen how long India can pull off their first innings on the second day
 yadi pehle din ke khel par najar daali jaae, to team india ke liye yah milajula rahaa
 However he took 3 in the 90 overs of the day
 23 ke ranret se 9 wicket par 291 jode, jo ek lihaaj se thikthak score he
 Nevertheless, Virat Kohli, the favorite of the audience, disappointed him
 kohli ke paas is match ko or yaadgaar banane kaa mauka 49wein over main 154 ke score par pujaara ke out hone ke baad mila, lekin vah vijay ke saath 13 ran jodakar pavilion laut gaye
 He started well
 do chauke bhi lagaae the, lekin pari ko aage nahin le ja sake
 Before them, opener Lokesh Rahul, who has shown a brilliant game so far in both Test and T20, scored fast, but this time he could not play big innings
 unhone 39 gendon main 32 ran thoke
 The highlight of the day's play was the innings of Murali Vijay and Cheteshwar Pujara
 gauratlab he ki in donon hi khilaadiyon ke sthaan ko lekar charchaa joro par thi
 We had seen this in the Windies when Kohli thought it better to take out of form Shikhar Dhawan in place of Vijay in the playing XI and gave importance to Rohit Sharma in place of Pujara
 haalanki isaki aalochana hone ke baad unhone kanpur main jahaan dhawan ko baahar kiya, vahiin rohit sharma ke moh se batch nahin paae or paanch kii jagah chaar gendbaajon lete hue rohit ko rakh liya
 Both Vijay and Pujara showed their classical batting on a slow and difficult looking wicket and proved the captain's earlier decisions wrong, leaving an indelible mark
 vijay ne 170 gendon kaa saamana kiya or 65 ran banaae, jabaki pujaara ne 109 gendon main 62 ran thoke
 The number of balls indicated that both batsmen showed the traditional game in Tests and gave evidence of being technically proficient
 duusari ore rohit sharma ne hameshaa kii tarah acchhee shuruyaat kii or 35 ran jode, lekin phir unka chirparichit laaparvaahibhara shot aayaa or vah chalate bane
 Meaning Rohit once again got stuck throwing wickets
 unki isi kamajori kii aalochana hoti rahi he, kyonki unke tallent ko lekar kisi ko andeh nahin he
 Yes, r Ashwin once again shined with the bat and scored 40 runs to bring relief to the team in the lower middle order, as the New Zealand bowlers appeared to dominate the middle
 tippaniyan Talking about New Zealand bowling, their spinners bowled well and took the test of Indian batsmen
 kai najdiki maamle bhi rahe
 Spinner Mitchell Santner was particularly upset
 kanpur ke wicket par kii baar halki dhul bhi uthati dikhi
 Santner also took advantage of this and took India's first two wickets
 pehle din unke naam 20 over main 3 wicket rahe
 Born at the other end, India-born Ish Sodhi supported him well
 haalanki vah ek wicket hi le paae
 In the final session, Trent Boult took a brilliant fast bowling view and took 3 wickets
 bolt ne inaswing ke saath-saath dhimi gendon kaa bhi bakhubi istemaal kiya, jinhen bhartiya ballebaaj pard nahin paae
 Overall, on the first day, Team India did not play as expected and looked back from a big target
 aise main newjiland ke paas ballebaaji main behatar karke bharat par dabaav banane kaa mauka ban gaya he
 Crease is currently Ravindra Jadeja and Umesh Yadav
 
 
 dekhne vaali baat hogi ki duusare din bharat apni pehali pari ko kab tak khinch paata he

 Middle-order batsman Suresh Raina said here on Monday that it was now India's turn to face the English team in the four-test series starting in Ahmedabad next month after England suffered a 0-4 loss to their home last year
 Give the same pain to england ke khilaaf mangalvaar se shuru hone vaale teen divasiy abhyaas match main bharat e kii aguwai kar rahe raina ne kaha, ‘main tab england main tha or main 0-4 se shrinkhalaa haarane ke dard ko samajhataa hum
 i want us to make them feel the same pain
 ’ raina kaa maananaa he ki aagaamee test shrinkhalaa main esji gendon ke upyog se bhartiya tej gendbaajon ko madad milegi
 He said, 'there is a big difference between SG test and Duke balls
 hamaare paas jaak (jahir khan) or umesh yadav jaise gendbaaj hai jo jaanate hai ki esji test gend ko kaise reverse swing kiya jaataa he
 In cities like Kolkata and Mumbai, where it is humid, it will be important to use the SG test ball properly
 ’ raina ne kaha, ‘hamaare paas ravichandran: aswin or pragyan ojha jaise achche spinner hai
 England have good fast bowlers like Steven Finn, Stuart Broad and James Anderson but it depends on how they use the SG Test ball
 yah 25 varshiya ballebaaj apane ‘adarsh khilaadi’ yuvaraj singh ke saath chathe number ke liye daud main he lekin unhone kaha ki isko bharna chayankartaaon kaa kaam he
 Raina said, 'yuvraj has just returned from recovering from a serious illness
 vah mere liye adarsh khilaadi hai
 i want to see him return to the Test team
 main bhi us sthaan par khelnaa chahta hum
 i want to play all four Test matches against England
 lekin main isamen dimag nahin khapaana chahta ki yah sthaan kisko milegaa
 It is up to the selectors who they select
 ’abhyaas match ke bare main unhone kaha, ‘mere liye yah match kaaphi mahatvapurn he
 If i score runs here then it will help me but if i can't make it then it will depend on the selectors
 yadi main yahaan acha pradarshan karata hum to main agle chaar test maichon main kheloongaa
 Tipsareena told Praveen Amre that he has taken tips from former Test batsman Praveen Amre to tackle England off-spinner Graeme Swann
 swaan isse pehle raina ko pareshaan karte rahe hai
 He said, 'I talked to him about Swan
 usne england main mujhe kaaphi pareshaan kiya tha tathaa chaar yaa paanch baar out kiya tha
 They told me that i should put my shoulder above the ball and my eyes should be on the line of the ball
 centurian main pari ke antar se shikast jhelane ke baad bharat ko agar teen maichon kii shrinkhalaa main apane daawey ko barkaraar rakhana he to use 26 disambar se durban ke kingsmid main shuru ho rahe duusare test main is maidan par mejabaan ke kharaab pradarshan se prerana leni hogi
 The Indian team, already trailing 0–1 in the series, will be hopeful that they too will be able to compete in the series, highlighting the weaknesses of South Africa at Kingsmead
 dakshin africa ne is maidan par khele 37 maichon main se 13 maichon main jeet darj kii he lekin iske saath hi use 11 maichon main shikast kaa bhi saamana karnaa padaa he
 Australia and England have defeated South Africa five times on this ground, while Pakistan has also been successful in defeating the hosts once
 duusari taraf haalanki is maidan par bharat kaa ricard bhi bahut acha nahin he or use is maidan par khele apane teen maichon main se do ganvaane pade hai jabaki ek match dra rahaa he
 India, however, will be hoping that their fast bowlers will help them succeed on this favorable pitch, while the second-innings success of the Centurion will carry the batsmen forward
 bharat ko saath hi ummid hogi ki chot ke kaaran pehle test se baahar rahe jahir khan durban main khilne ke liye feet ho jaaenge
 If this happens, India's bowling attack will be strong, which was seen to be scattering in Centurion
 ballebaaji main bharat ko centurian main 50waan test shatak lagane vaale master blaster sachin tendulkar ke alaava isi match main ardhashatak jadne vaale captain mahendra singh dhoni, gautam gambhir or virendra sahvaag se achche pradarshan kii ummid hogi
 Apart from this, the team's eyes will be on the experienced Rahul Dravid and VVS Laxman in the middle order who could not meet the expectations in the Centurion
 is maidan par haalanki bhartiya ballebaajon kaa ricard bahut acha nahin rahaa he
 Tendulkar participated in all three matches of India here but 18
 6 kii ausat se keval 93 ran hi bana paye jabaki dravid ke naam par yahaan do maichon main 16-6 kii ausat se keval 50 ran darj hai
 Sehwag has scored only eight runs in a match here, while Dhoni has 81 and Laxman 65 runs in one match
 duusari taraf pehle test main doharaa shatak jadne vaale dakshin africa ke alrounder jaak kallis ko yah maidan kaaphi raas aata he or unhone yahaan 13 maichon main 56
 Has scored 1124 runs at an average of 20
 iske alaava pehle test ke shatakaveer abi divilliars (460), greem smith (449) or eshwel prince (350) ne bhi is maidan par khub ran batore hai
 Talking of bowling, India will be hoping that fast bowling attack leader Zaheer will play in this match, which will strengthen his bowling which did not affect at all in the first Test
 jahir ne is maidan par ek match khelaa he lekin vah adhik safal nahin rahe
 This fast bowler got only three wickets in this match while he spent 148 runs
 jahir ke alaava keval saathi tej gendbaaj es srisanth ko hi is maidan par gendbaaji karne kaa anubhav he
 Sreesanth took eight wickets in the only match here and Team India will be expected to perform well once again
 duusari taraf dakshin africa ke tej gendbaajon ko yahaan kii pich kaaphi raas aati he
 Kallis has taken 18 wickets in 13 matches here while Dale Steyn has 16 wickets in four matches
 iske alaava pehle test main bhartiya ballebaaji kram ko dhwast karne vaale tej gendbaaj morne morkal ke naam yahaan teen maichon main aath wicket darj hai

 in / The UN Security Council finally called Masood Azhar a Global Terrorist
 abhi tak china isamen adnga bana hua tha
 On February 27, China had sought some time by putting a technical hold on the proposal presented in the United Nations
 china kii is harakat ke baad us par antarrashtriya dabaav banane laga
 In such a situation, it is important to know what is the process of declaring a terrorist as a global terrorist and what are the obstacles in this
 kya he global tebrist ghoshit karne kii prakriya?kisi bhi aatanki ko global tebrist ghoshit karne kaa faisla yuan suraksha parishad karti he
 It consists of the permanent members of the United States, China, France, Britain and Russia, while ten temporary members
 kisi ko vaishvik aatanki ghoshit karne ke liye sabhi sthai sadasyon kii sahmati jaruri hoti he
 In the United Nations Security Council Committee Resolution 1267, also called ISIAS and Al Qaeda approval list, the name of the terrorist has to be entered
 is list main naam aane ke baad wo aatanki vaishvik aatanki ghoshit ho jaataa he
 What happens to the global terrorist, tell you that once an international terrorist is declared in the United Nations, the government in the country where he lives, has to immediately confiscate the property of such a terrorist
 saath hi is par bhi nazar rakhni hoti he ki use kahin se bhi kisi tarah kii aarthik madad na mili
 Being a global terrorist means that Masood Azhar can no longer enter the border of any country included in the United Nations and neither country can grant him a visa
 wo jis desh main hoga, vahaan use kisi tarah kii yatra nahin karne di jaaegi
 What are the Global Terrorists? According to the United Nations rules, the country in which these global terrorists live has the responsibility to strictly enforce their restrictions on the country
 magar pakistan main ye global terrarist jo chaahate hai karte hai, balki pakistan to aatankiyon kii ashgaah bana hua he
 From Dawood to Hafiz Saeed and Masood Azhar, roam here whenever you want
 27 farvari ko laayaa gaya tha chauthaa prastaavpulawama hamale ke baad 27 farvari ko bharat ke samarthan main america, britain or france sanyukt raashtra main ajahar ke khilaaf prastaav lekar aae the
 More than 10 countries supported the proposal
 tay kiya gaya ki agar suraksha parishad ke kisi sadsy ko is par aitraaj naa ho to jaish ke sargana masood ajahar ko antarrashtriya aatanki ghoshit kar diya jayega
 The offer deadline was ending on March 13 at 12:30 pm
 us samay laga ki is baar to masood ko uske kiye kii sajaa mil hi jaaegi, magar prastaav kii samay seemaa khatm hone se sirf ek ghanta pehle china ne is par adnga laga diya
 However, following the resolution, members of the Security Council gave a clear warning to China that if it does not change its stand on Masood Azhar, other options of action are also open
 aise main china par naa sirf bharat balki duusare deshon kaa dabaav bhi bana hua tha
 China has been doing the trick for 10 years
 In the last 10 years, there were 4 attempts to declare Masood as an international terrorist
 sabase pehle 2009 main manmohan sarkaar ne sanyukt raashtra main ye prastaav rakhaa tha
 In 2016, India proposed with the United States, Britain and France
 2017 main bharat ne inhen deshon ke saath milakar teesri baar prastaav rakhaa
 After this, in 2019, the proposal was again placed in the Sanctions Council led by France
 har baar china ne masood ajahar ko bachaane ke liye vito kaa istemaal kiya
 International pressure on China began to increase for the fourth time
 sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad ke baaki ke chaar sadsy usase naaraaz hone lage the
 The veto of China was taken by France, America and Britain as its own
 duusare duniya ke baaki deshon main china ko lekar dharna ye banane lagi ki wo aatankwaadi kaa himachati desh he
 With this, he started coming under pressure
 ‘technical hold’ lagaakar china ne maanga tha vaktsamyukt raashtra suraksha parishad main march main hui baithak main haalanki china ne prastaav ko giraane ke liye vito power kaa istemaal nahin kiya tha, magar prastaav ko ‘technical hold’ par rakhkar vichaar karne ke liye vakt maanga tha
 But a month later, in a second meeting on this issue, China had to bow down and agreed to declare Jaish kingpin Masood Azhar an international terrorist
 isi ke baad idhar china ne masood ke sir se haath hataaya udhar masood ajahar antarrashtriya aatankwaadi ghoshit ho gaya
 Two international terrorists roaming in Pakistan, Masood Azhar is not the only global terrorist, but Dawood Ibrahim and Hafiz Saeed are also global terrorists
 saal 2003 main daaud ko bharat or america ne global terrarist ghoshit kiya tha, jabaki 2012 main america ne global terrarist hafiz said par 10 billian dollar kaa inaam bhi ghoshit kiya tha
 Nevertheless, Hafiz Saeed and Dawood Ibrahim are living life comfortably
 daud ibrahim apana real state kaa dhandha sambhaal rahaa he or uske kai baar videsh jane kii khabar he
 At the same time, Hafiz Saeed's organization is training terrorists in its old style
 itnaa hi nahin pichley aam chunaavon main to hafiz ne apane aatankiyon ko chunaav tak ladaa daalaa or ab wo pakistan kaa piem banane kaa sapana dekh rahaa he

 Earlier, BJP MP Chintamani Malviya from Ujjain in Madhya Pradesh had given a controversial statement about Rahul Gandhi
 rahul gandhi in dinon gujarat daure par hai or lagaataar mandiron ke darshan kar rahe hai
 Regarding this, BJP MP Malaviya said that Rahul Gandhi has become religious, it is a matter of happiness, but why he is going to the temples of Gujarat only, why never visit the temples of Kashmir, Kerala and Karnataka
 chintamani malviya ne ye bhi kaha tha, 'sawaal uthta he ki rahul gandhi kii dharmikata sachhee he yaa kuch dinon ke liye dikhaava maatr he
 Somewhere this secularism is not the same as it has been heard that the prostitute is the most secular, the question comes to mind that Rahul Gandhi's secularism is not like a prostitute

 in se saabhaar) a post shared by Manasi Parekh (@manasi_parekh) on Mar 21, 2018 at 7:58 am PDT jis samay pradhanmantri bengalooru main behad sade libaas main sena ke adhikariyon ko sambodhit kar rahe the thik usee samay ke aas-paas unke grih rajya surat main us suut kii nilaamee shuru ho gai, jise lekar in dinon khub raajnneetik vivaad hue
 In the Lok Sabha elections, every dress of the Prime Minister from the candidate to the swearing-in was seen in terms of fashion and style statement
 unke prabhaav main aakar logon ne bhi apanaaya
 The workers also started walking like their Prime Minister
 acha or achche se pahananaa raajnneetik karypranali se bhi jud gaya
 Outside the state BJP office, a Muslim shopkeeper selling imitation of Modi's colored jackets was recalled, who said that on the very next day of the color of the jacket Modi is wearing on TV, workers start demanding that we of the same color Need a house lekin raajnneeti ke alaava antarrashtriya or rashtriya media main khaas vajah se vivaadit is suut kii nakal karne kaa prayaas kisi ne nahin kiya
 However, since the signature of the shirt on the arm is in fashion
 apana or kisi kaa bhi naam haath se lekar kaan tak par godwane kaa chalan bhi he, lekin suut kii har dhari apane hi naam kii bani ho ye logon ko pasand nahin aayaa, ise samajhane kii zarurat he
 Was it because of the disputed price of the suit, which raised the question of what message the Prime Minister wants to convey by wearing such an expensive suit
 kya logon ko is suut main vah narendra modi dikhe jinke bare main ve nahin jaanate the
 Did this suit make the Prime Minister unknown to the people whose hearts he ruled
 darasal, suut kii vivaadit keemat ke alaava unke naam kii bani dhari ne bhi kaaphi nuksaan pahunchaaya
 Connected the Prime Minister with those aspects which were discussed, but nobody paid much attention to the extent
 kai logon ko us suut main atmamugdh vyaktivaadee modi nazar aane lage
 Some compared it to the suit of Egyptian dictator Hosni Mubarak
 hosni mubarak bhi isi tarah kii apane naam kii dhari se las suut pahante the
 Modi's fashion designers have for some time distanced their leader from this one suit, from those who have longed for him
 dilli ke chunaav kawarej ke dauraan saamaanya jan ko bhi us suut ko lekar baat karte suna tha
 Those who accepted the Prime Minister in all colors did not submit this blue suit
 lekin ab vah suut surat main nilaam ho rahaa he
 Along with this suit, gifts received as Prime Minister will also be auctioned
 jo suchi media se saajha kii gai he, usamen 237 kapade hai, magar media main yah nilaamee suut ke kaaran hi surkhiyon main ai he
 Apart from clothes, there are many other items in the auction, which will be auctioned for the next three days
 bataaya gaya he ki isse jo paisa aayega vah ganga kii safai main laga diya jayega
 So now the Prime Minister will be free from the stains attached to this suit
 kya vivaad ab tham jayega
 Those who defend the Prime Minister will say that if they wear such an expensive suit for the Ganges, then the opponents will add the price of the auction and see how expensive the suit is
 yah vivaad chalata rahegaa
 People may not even believe that this suit was worn for the Ganges, but in the matter of readiness to learn a lesson, the Prime Minister will have to be shunned
 unhone is suut se chhutkaaraa paane main haftaa bhar nahin lagaaya
 After the results of the Delhi elections, the color of his clothes is not as sharp as the color for which he is known
 samvaad or sanchaar main maahir pradhanmantri se zyada behatar koun samaj saktaa he
 In recent times, they are telling that they have learned a lesson
 manmohan singh sarkaar ke aakhri daur main jab har taraf niraashaa kaa maahaul tha, modi apane rangeen or kalafadaar kurton se yah sandesh dene main safal rahe ki ve chunauti uthaane ke liye taiyaar hai
 They can communicate hope
 logon ne un rangon ko majboot netritv ke swaabhaavik gunon se jodakar dekh liya or sarkaar banane ke baad bhi vahi silsilaa jari rahaa
 But was there anything more about the display of these colors, so that people chose a person in Delhi in front of the leadership of the shining Prime Minister, whose fashion should not be imitated even in the birthday of their child
 arvind kejariwal ne yah bataa diya ki aam jan kaa libaas aisa hi he
 Even if not fashionable, he can buy this much and likes to wear the same, in those whose houses do not have electricity and the hitter does not work, people like Arvind tighten the ears with a muffler to keep it warm
 manki cap kaa kitna bhi koi mazaaq uda le magar pahanane vaale pahante hi hai
 You can go from Kolkata to Bihar and see it
 dilli chunaav ke nateezon main ek fishan statement bhi he
 The public does not always judge the leader only in clothes with the best size and design
 usne ek behad saadhaaran se dikhne vaale sweater, mafalar or patalun ke saamne diziner magar kathith rup se lakhon ke suut ko parrast kar diya
 This suit may be sold in crores at auction or it may be that it will be bid very low but whoever takes this suit will not be able to proudly show this Namo suit, because there is no fashion statement left in this suit
 is
 is suut ko namo ne bhi apana banaakar gale nahin lagaaya par samajhadaari dikhaate hue jhatak diya he
 This is a cloth that even the Prime Minister will not make a part of his good memories
 ho saktaa he ki kharidne vaala bhi is suut ko apane ghar ke kisi bakse ke kone main chupchaap dafan kar de

 If you see Yasine while working in a company, then be cautious, because now the company no longer trusts you
 niyam - kanoon se bhari naukari:sabhi company ke apane niyam - kanoon hote hai
 But in your company, only the rules - laws remain as if from getting up to sitting, understand that your company did not trust you
 duusari baat ye ki aapaki company ko kaam se matlab itnaa zyada he ki aap kahin stand nahin karte hai
 Strict Attitude: When the flexibility of your workmates in an institution is over, it should not be delayed to understand that it is no longer in your interest
 ham sabhi insaan he or kaam ke saath-saath har insaan kii duusari jaruri jimmedaariyaan hai
 If you have to explain this to an office, then you are fooling
 aise main bas itnaa karen ki jitani jaldi ho sake bag pack kar len
 Checking the Internet: In many companies, the boss feels that by closing the social networking site, employees work more
 lihaaja sabhi soshal site par lock laga diya jaataa he
 But the company forgets that doing so does not increase or increase productivity in the work, it definitely bothers the worker
 aapke offis main bhi agar aisa ho rahaa he to satark ho jaaen
 No work from home: All offices prefer to work at home
 aise main jaruri he ki company is baat kaa dhyaan rakhen ki koun sa karmchaaree ghar par kaam karne main suvidha mahasoos kar rahaa he
 Because opening the office at home after office troubles your family along with you
 lagaataar kaam kii jaanch:koun kaisaa kaam kar rahaa he or kya kaam kar rahaa he
 There is no harm in knowing this
 aisa sabhi company karti hai
 But if you are constantly monitored and every work starts, then do not delay to understand that your boss did not trust you
 is vajah se har kaam main roak-tok shuru ho chuki he

 We are the present
 What we do and how we do it, is our future
 Thank you to all those who have come out to support me- i did not ask for it and that makes it even more special
 As an artist i am proud of my industry
 I'm grateful to my senior artists for paving the way for people like me and so many others
 i am also proud of myself
 In this journey of mine, i can proudly say that i have done what i thought was right and never succumbed to what others thought was right for me
 That - i will continue to do
 inshallah
 In a world full of hate, let's choose to love
 Let's be tolerant of other people's opinions and let our fight be against the mindset -that a successful woman is a scary thought
 No it isnt
 It's a beautiful and empowering one
 Let us stop picking on one another so that this industry and our country thrives like no other

 Salman had recently given a statement regarding the shooting of 'sultan' that the fatigue of shooting for 'sultan' was like a rape Victim
 salmaanake is vivaadit bayaan jaise hi surkhiyon main chaaya, bhaijan ke phans ne bhi unka paksh lete hue twitor par twits kii bauchhaar kar daali
 The hashtag trending # salmanmisquoted is trending on Twitter
 salmaan ke phans ne unka paksh lete hue kai twits kiye hai
 Defending the controversy, his fans say that the media has misrepresented Salman Khan's statement and tried to spoil his image by showing only half-hearted statements

 "and continued further interview # salmanmisquoted — Jαι Sυlтαи❤ (@ beingsalmaniac1) June 21, 2016 main nahin chahta ki jetali istifa den
 This is why i do not want a chance to defend them
 bahut se patrakaron ko jab jetali kaa bachaav karte dekha to us din pehali baar laga ki life main peeche rah gaya
 But then it seemed that when Jaitley also needed the rescue of these journalists, then it seemed that Jaitley was left behind more than me
 in patrakaron ne bachaav main utar kar jetali ke satta sansar kii garima ko kam kar diya he
 The Reporter Bureau does not defend Chief
 beuro cheef kaa kaam hota he reporter kaa bachaav karnaa
 Why did Shivam Vij tweet in a tweet that Jaitley is not just called a bureau chief
 tab se main or dukhi hum
 i respect Jaitley very much
 magar in champuon se apana bachaav na karavaaen
 For your sake, i write that you do not resign
 main aapke saath hum
 Shivam Vij may not know when the Managing Editor of Media has changed
 godi media ke system main sirf ek managing editor hota he
 And now this system is going to be fifty years old
 is system main polytical editor yaa beuro cheef kaa kaam nahin bachaa he
 Naqvi and Singhvi's bytes come from ANI
 jise ab ‘bite ho gai’ hona kehete hai
 The same situation is with the anchors as well
 dear janata ji, aap kab tak ye tamaasha dekhenge
 Will you see when the whole thing is destroyed? Listen to the song of mughal-e-azam
 aji haa ham bhi dekhenge
 Heard a journalist say that he saw that Jaitley and Mallya met for 30 seconds
 ek ne kaha 40 second kii hui
 i remember such a perfect description of the meeting of two years ago i
e
 1 March 2016
 hamaare patrakaron ke paas us samay stop watch rahaa hoga
 As soon as Mallya got closer to Jaitley, he must have started counting seconds
 xxwrep 9 tik tik, xxwrep 9 tik tik, xxwrep 9 tik tik, xxwrep 9 tik tik
 Count properly kul chalis tik tik likhe hai hamane
 i met just like that
 stop watch patrakaron ne nahin likhaa
 Finance Minister Jaitley Ji, who writes on the Ministry of Defense, did not write a blog
 agar aapako yah lagata he ki yah sab likh dene se lutian dilli kaa system badal jayega to galatafahami main hai
 Why did these reporters just say
 tab kyon nahin kaha
 Delhi is fine as they say to me, did not speak on Bengal
 kya soch kar tab nahin likhaa ki gabbar bahut kush hoga
 Will reward maalya bhul jayega
 Now journalists deserve this, so Jaitley's fault
 vaise mere paas puri list he ki maine kab kab nahin bolaa
 You can silence me by releasing that list
 jaise wo log chup the tees second kii mulaakaat ke baad do saal tak
 Mallya's India abandonment episode has two ends
 ek chor he ki maalya ko maalya koun banaaya or doosraa chor he maalya kinake raaj main or kinaki madad se bhaaga
 Two separate press conferences are being held on both ends
 iz ikval tu
 The truth is that Mallya, with the help of every party, obliged India's parliamentary tradition by bringing himself to the Rajya Sabha
 upkaar kiya
 i respect this contribution of Mallya
 is maamle main pro-maalya hum
 Was Mallya a very big political thinker? The people who brought him to Parliament spoke in front of him
 van centens main! Vijay Mallya, Lalit Modi, Nirav Modi, our Mehul Bhai, Jatin Mehta have all abandoned India
 lalit modi vaale prakaran main to kis kis kaa naam aata tha, wo sab to lok smriti se gaayab ho chukaa he
