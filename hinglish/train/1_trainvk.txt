yahaan muslim dharm guru kalbe sadik ne ek majalis ke dauraan kaha ki jo muslim lav jehad karata he use jaan se maar dena chahie
 So it is about religion, which teaches to live
 lekin dharm ke pairokaar marane-maarane kii baat karte hai
 Actually, another statement has come from Sunni clerics and Aligarh Muslim University on this side
 dilachasp yah he ki yah 'lav jehad' ke shabdic arth ko lekar he
 The teachers here have said that there is no concept of 'love jihad' in Islam and the term has been coined incorrectly
 yani ki maamle se itar iske shabdic arth ko lekar ek or nai bahes
 According to Dharma Guru's 'religious voice' information, Muslim religion guru Kalbe Sadiq was addressing a Majlis in Kachibagh of Varanasi
 is dauraan unhone kaha ki jo muslim lav jehad kare use maar dena chahie
 He spoke on the issue of Iraq and said that the same should happen for Iraq as Prime Minister Narendra Modi extended a helping hand after flooding into Pakistan
 yahi nahin unhone varanasi kaa vikaas ganga-jamuni tahjeeb ke anusaar hona chahie
 On the concept of 'love jihad', on the other hand, the case of love jihad in Aligarh has now reached the word concept
 sunni maulaviyon or aligarh muslim uniwarsity ke shikshakon ne guuruuvaar ko kaha ki islam main 'lav jehad' jaisi koi avadharana nahin he or ye shabd galat tareeke se gadha gaya he
 In a statement, Mufti Zahid Ali Khan, president of amu's Sunni theology department and Associate Professor M
 Salim, said, "luring innocent girls by making false promises of any kind is not only prohibited in Islam but is considered a hateful act
" koi bhi yadi aisa karata he or iske liye kisi bhi tarah kii safai yaa tark detaa he to vah islam ke saath ghor anyaay kar rahaa he
 We strongly condemn this
 islam main lav jehad jaisi koi avadharana nahin he or ye shabd galat tareeke se gadha gaya he
 The teachers said that the way in which some groups are raising this non-existent issue, they are merely polarizing the society and getting short term benefits
 bayaan main kaha gaya ki kuch kattarpanthi hindu sanghathanon or raajnneetik dalon dwaara maujuuda samay main chalaaya ja rahaa 'lav jehad' abhiyaan bahut hi khatarnaak he or yah desh kii shanti or samprabhutaa ke liye vinaashkari sabit ho saktaa he
 He said that it is unfortunate that the state governments and the Center did not take necessary steps on this issue
 is tarah ke abhiyaan se desh kaa saamaajik taana-bana dhwast ho jayega or aarthik vikaas kaarykram patari se utar jaaenge
 'such people should be punished' Zahid said, as alleged by the leaders of some Hindu organizations, if there is a so-called organized attempt to seduce Hindu girls for the purpose of conversion, then it was brought to the notice of the established Muslim religious organizations
 should go
 unhone kaha ki phir ye hamaara kartavya hoga ki is tarah kaa kaam karne waalon ko ham dandit karen
 Zahid said that Jihad is a very sacred word for our community and in true sense it symbolizes the effort for spiritual uplift
 unhone kaha ki jehad kaa istemaal damankaaree ke khilaaf sangharsh ke liye bhi hota he
 People struggling to capture a country or land and involved in the murders of innocents are misusing the term
 dhokhaa hua to maamla lav jehad he: bijepiis bich bijepi ne lav jehad ko mahatvapurn mudda bataate hue kaha ki yadi koi kisi ladki ko phusalaakar usase vivaah karata he or baad main ladki mahasoos karti he ki uske saath dhokhaa hua he to yah lav jehad hua
 When asked about this, BJP state president Laxmikant Vajpayee said, "if a young man marries a young woman by making false aura and later the woman feels that she has been cheated, then the matter is serious
" ' Sunil Chhetri, one of India's finest footballers, on Saturday made an emotional appeal to the fans of Lionel Messi, Neymar and Cristiano Ronaldo, saying, "abuse us, criticize but definitely come to the stadium to watch the Indian football team play

 Chief Minister Nitish Kumar's opposition to the new liquor policy has started in Bihar
 virodh karne vaale vipakshi dalon ke netaa nahin balki unke mahagathbandhan ke vidhayak hai
 After coming to power in November last year, Nitish Kumar is getting the voice of protest from his mlas for the first time
 shuukravaar se shuru hone vaale bihar vidhansabha satr main is vidheyak ko pesh kiya jayega
 When this was discussed in the cabinet, Nitish Kumar realized that his cabinet members did not agree with his view on the issue, but he refused and passed it
 abhi tak is mudde par rashtriya janata dal or congress ke vidhayakon ne virodh jataayaa he
 Those protesting include mlas Virender, Shakeel Ahmed Khan and Ramdev Rai
 in vidhayakon kaa kahana he ki agar kisi ghar main jaisaa sharaab niti main prastaavit he ki sharaab milegi, us ghar ke sabhi vayask sadasyon ko jail bheja ja saktaa he
 The comments is kanoon kaa police ke dwaara jamkar durupyog kiya jayega or janata main sarkaar ke khilaaf baithe-bithaae naaraazgi paidaa hogi
 Bhai Virender or Ramdev Rai All members say that the ban on liquor has greatly affected the society, but if the law is reversed, then there can be increased resentment in the society, which no politician wants
 haalanki rajya cabinet kii baithak main nitish kumaar ne sadasyon ko aashwast kiya tha ki isse samaaj main sharaab ke avaidh kaarobaar main lage logon main dehshat paidaa hogi, lekin adhikansh sadasyon kaa kahana he ki nitish is mudde par kisi kii nahin sunanaa chaahate or vah apni manmarjee kar rahe hai
 The legislators believe that the excise department officials are giving the opinion of the inverted laws on this issue, which will not be able to stay in the court for even a minute
 nishchit rup se mahagathbandhan ke vidhayak dal kii baithak main bhi yah mudda chaaya rahegaa, lekin nishchit rup se is vidheyak ko bihar vidhanmandal ke donon sadanon main paarit karnaa nitish kumaar ke liye aasaan nahin hoga
 The bill will be introduced in the Bihar assembly session starting on Friday
 cabinet main jab is par charchaa hui thi tabhi nitish kumaar ko is baat kaa ahsaas ho gaya tha ki unke cabinet ke sadsy is mudde par unke vichaar se sahamat nahin hai, lekin unhone manaakar ise paas kara liya tha
 So far, Rashtriya Janata Dal and Congress mlas have protested on this issue
 virodh karne waalon main vidhayak virender, shakeel ahamed khan or ramdev raay jaise vidhayak shaamil hai
 These legislators say that if the alcohol policy is proposed in a house that alcohol will be found, all adult members of that house can be sent to jail
 tippaniyan This law will be grossly misused by the police and will create public resentment against the government
 bhai virender ho yaa ramdev raay sabhi sadasyon kaa kahana he ki sharaab par pabandi se samaaj par kaaphi asar hua he, lekin ulte-pulte kanoon agar ban gaye to samaaj main naaraazgi bad sakati he, jo koi rajaneta nahin chahta
 Although at the state cabinet meeting, Nitish Kumar had assured the members that this would create panic among the people engaged in the illegal trade of alcohol in the society, but most of the members say that Nitish does not want to listen to anyone on this issue and he will do his own will are doing
 vidhayakon kaa maananaa he ki is mudde par utpaada vibhaag ke adhikari ulte-pulte kanoonon kii raay de rahe hai, jo court main ek minute bhi nahin thahar paaenge
 Certainly, this issue will also prevail in the meeting of the legislature party of the Grand Alliance, but surely it will not be easy for Nitish Kumar to pass this bill in both houses of Bihar Legislature

 padmavati par jari raajnneetik ghamaasan ke bich bijepi ke siem manoharlal khatter ne alag raah pakad lee he
 In one case, his opinion is completely opposite to that of UP CM Yogi Adityanath
 haryana main film bain karne kii maang par kaha, 'sensor se clearence se pehle kisi film ko bain karnaa thik nahin hoga
 'khattar also asked for answers from those who announced the reward on beheading
 haryana cabinet ke do mantriyon kii maang par buudhvaar ko ek press conference main khatter ne kaha, 'padmavati ko lekar ham sensor board ke clearence ke baad hi koi faisla lenge
 But playing with public sentiments in the name of the film is not tolerated
 kisi ko bhi aisa karne kaa haq nahin he
 'he said,' i believe that it is not right for the Censor Board to ban any film before clearance
 ' deepika padukon or sanjay lila bhansaali kaa sir kaatane par 10 karod inaam dene vaale bijepi netaa ke bayaan ko khatter ne nijee raay bataaya
 Khattar would ask for an answer on the declaration
 He said, 'this is his personal opinion
 sarkaar kaa isse koi matlab nahin he
 We will issue them a show cause notice for the statement
 ' bataate chalem ki isi tarah ke bayaan par ek sawaal ke jawaab main upi siem yogi adityanath ne kaha tha, 'kisi ko bhi kanoon apane haath main lene kaa adhikaar nahin he
 i believe Bhansali is also no less guilty if the threaters are guilty
 is aadhaar par agar dhamkee dene waalon ke khilaaf karrwai honi chahie to bhansaali ke khilaaf bhi karrwai honi chahie
 Padmavati: On the statement of beheading, the actor said - 'it is a matter of sadness to be Indian'
 According to the demands of the two ministers, there was a meeting of Haryana cabinet in the presence of CM Khattar on Wednesday
 isamen do mantriyon ne aitihaasik tathyon ke saath chhedchhad kaa aarope lagaate hue film ke content par aapatti jaahir kii
 The ministers said, 'if the content is not being removed from the film, then its performance should be banned in the state'
 The BJP leader had threatened to burn the cinema
 The Rajput society of the country has the power to burn one-screen
 inhone pehle bhi padmavati ke nirdeshak sanjay lila bhansaali or padmavati kaa role karne vaali deepika padukon kaa sir kaatane ke badale 10 karod rupee ke inaam kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 Amu had said, 'if this film is released, we will run a cleanliness drive in theaters
 vivaadit film ko rokane ke liye pradhanmantri narendra modi ko apni takat kaa istemaal karnaa chahie
 'amu is the Chief Media Co-ordinator of Haryana BJP
 in rajyon main pradarshan rokane kii ho chuki he batupi main vivaadit content ke saath film relies nahin karne kii baat saamne aa chuki he
 Shivraj Singh Chauhan of MP and Vasundhara Raje's government of Rajasthan have also said to stop the screening of the film

 According to fake currency coming from these routes, fake notes are entering from Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal

 Pakistan is the main source of counterfeit notes

 Before Deswa, Nitin had made a Maithili film 'mithla Makhana' and this film got 63rd National Award
 desava kii charchaa ham isliye kar rahe hai ki kai saal pehle is film kaa nirmaan kiya gaya tha
 Nitin recently released it digitally

 From the very beginning, the film manages to bind the audience
 film kii kahani saral he
 By the way, many films have been made in Hindi on this plot
 kaahni main bahut kuch nayaa nahin he, lekin drishy or prastuti kaa andaaj alag he
 In particular, frame-by-frame camera work can be called amazing
 2011 main bani is film ko desh-videsh ke kai samarohon main dikhaaya ja chukaa he
 But in India, the film has been released on youtube on 23 December

 Without thinking anything, he picks up kado (mud) in his hand and ships the number plate from it
 yah bada hi original seen he
 The praise of those who make and think deswa is less
 kyonki yah keval film nahin he balki li se hatakar alag karne kii koshish he
 Although the story of the film could have been improved further
 puraani kahani kai baar prabhaavaheen najar aati he
 It is a little difficult to explain why the film ends up making filgood at the end
 darshak ke man main ek sawaal kyon nahin chhod dena chaahate he
 The climax could have been made better

 mahabalipuramme piem modi or shi chinafing kii do din kii baatcheet ke baad shanivaar ko sarkari samvaad samiti shinhua ne ek report jari kiya
 The report said that the two leaders exchanged in-depth views on sino-india relations and President Xi Chinfing said during this time that we should take the issues related to each other's core interests very carefully
 hamen un samasyaon kaa upyukt dhang se prabandhan or niyantran karnaa chahie, jinhen philhal suljhaayaa nahin ja saktaa

 centre or rajya sarkaron ko ek kanoon ke tahat har chah maheene par bataanaa chahie ki kis vibhaag main, kis shrenee main kitni naukariyaan nikaali gai hai or kitne logon kii chantni kii gai he or kitni naukariyon kii sankhya pehle kii tulana main kam kii gai he
 It is important that we know constitutionally what the number of jobs is
 netaaon or mantriyon kii gappabaazi bahut ho chuki he
 It would have been nice to have them tweet these information regularly and tell people that this is the number
 tabhi ham jaan sakenge ki sarkaron ke paas naukariyon kaa kitna bada bazaar he
 How many seats have been filled with reservation and how many are left vacant
 privet companiyon kii naukariyon kaa andaaza agar mushkil he, to sarkari naukariyon kii ginati bahut aasaan he
 First, the count of private jobs can also be easily done, but the work of counting government jobs can be done at the same time and at least a week of hard work
 yah pataa hona zaruri he ki sarkarein vibhinn staron par kitne rojgaar paidaa karti hai
 What are their policies regarding permanent and temporary jobs
 kanoon ke tahat yah bhi bataaya janaa chahie ki asthaayee prakruti kii naukariyon kaa pratishat sthaayee kism kii naukariyon kii tulana main kitna he
 Professor Vivek Kumar says that there is usually no reservation in temporary jobs and now most of the jobs in government jobs are taken in this way
 agar yah sahi he to isaki bhi ginati honi chahie ki un asthaayee naukariyon main anusuchit jati, janajati varg ke kitnon logon ko jagah mili he
 First, the condition of temporary jobs is no less frightening
 arakshit ho yaa anarakshit, is tarah kii naukariyon main sab pis rahe hai
 Go to any state
 theke par kaam kar rahe shikshakon kii haalat bahut karaab he
 If there is a need and our leaders lie so much after education, then why not make the appointments of teachers transparent and better
 kyon nahin shikshak banane kii prakriya ko yogyata-aadhaarit or behatar banaaya jaataa
 Many departments are starting to outsource their work, which is creating less jobs in the government sector
 sawaal aarakshan ke rahane kaa to he hi, yah bhi to pataa chale ki sarkaar ke paas naukariyaan hai bhi yaa chali gayi, yaa unki prakruti badalakar aarakshan ko samaapt kar diya gaya
 The Prime Minister is repeatedly saying that no one can touch reservation
 aarakshan adhikaar he, lekin is bahes kii shuruyaat vipaksh ne shuru kii yaa aresas ne
 
 
 The The RSS has made a number of statements about reservation, ranging from review to reservation till the discrimination is eradicated from the society
 bijepi ko samarthan dene vaala naujavaanon kaa ek bada tabaka aarakshan-virdohi he
 From here and there, there is an attempt to keep the hope within him that something is happening or the discussion is starting on reservation
 ummid he, ab aise logon ko bijepi or sangh kii taraf se jawaab mil gaya hoga ki aarakshan koi nahin hataa saktaa
 There is a kind of casteism in their opposition to reservation too
 samiksha ke naam par sangh kii taraf se aisi baaten hoti hai, jinhen lekar ek bade varg main tarah-tarah kii ashankaayen failati hai
 Those who are pro-reservation, they should know what is the condition of jobs and reservation from state to center level
 jo aarakshan-virdohi hai, ve bhi pataa karen ki naukariyaan nikal rahi hai yaa nahin
 Reservation does not eat jobs, government consumes jobs
 jab naukariyaan hongi hi nahin, to unka laabh na aarakshan samarthakon ko milegaa, na virodhiyon ko
 If you do not understand such a simple thing, then nothing will be done by filling the page for reservation debate
 vahi daleelein aaj bhi di ja rahi hai, jo pehle di ja rahi thim
 People should force all governments to speak on the possibility of jobs, clarify policy and count
 agar isi tarah andhere main rahakar bhavukta se bahes kerani he, to vah aapaki marzi
 The Prime Minister has said the last thing on his behalf regarding reservation
 ummid he, unki party or sangh ke bheetar kii shakhaon ne saaf-saaf sun liya he
 Now since they could not dismiss the name of the Sangh, they took the name of the opposition
 raajnneeti main itnaa chalata he
 The Opposition may have given its response, but the RSS listened silently or gave its response silently after listening
 yah un logon kii badi jeet he, jinhen lag rahaa tha ki aarakshan ke haq ke liye sadak par utarane kii zarurat pad sakati he
 They won this battle again only in a minor debate
 isse zyada pasinaa to aarakshan virodhiyon ne twitor or fasebuk par baha diya
 But at the same time it is happening that the debate and politics challenging the reservation through the new contests of the classes is being given vent
 in maangon ke jariye bhraamak asahmatiyaan paidaa kii ja rahi hai
 You must have heard a statement by Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan on reservation
 yah bayaan sirf aarakshan ke liye mahatvapurn nahin he, balki ise dalit-adivasee varg kii bechainiyon ke sandarbh main padhaa janaa chahie
 Paswan has so far remained silent within the Narendra Modi government
 rohit vemula kii khudakushi kii ghatana ke baad unki party ne sakriyata dikhaai thi, magar paswan or unki party centre sarkaar ke saath hi khadey nazar aae
 Paswan said that the land of the tribals is being taken away
 unhen visthapit kar unki zamin se sona nikaala ja rahaa he
 If they do not get jobs, they will become Naxalites
 in dinon paswan kii sarkaar ke paale ke samarthakon kii taraf se naksalwadiyon ko deshadrohi bataane or deshadrohi ko naksalwadi bataane kaa chalan ho gaya he
 In that court, Paswan is the first leader who has dared to explain for the first time how Naxalism is born
 sarkaar kii nitiyon se paidaa ho rahaa he
 Is Paswan also saying that the process has been accelerated by the policies under which his government has distributed mining licenses in tribal areas, but his statement is a comment on the policies of all those governments
 pradhanmantri kah rahe hai ki aarakshan kaa adhikaar koi nahin le saktaa
 He is not saying anything new
 nai baat ramvilas paswan kah rahe hai
 Actually, the matter of reservation in private companies is also not new, but Paswan has done the courage to raise this question in this government
 khaskar tab, jab is sarkaar ke sahyogi yaa matra-sanghathanon ke log aarakshan kii samiksha ke bahaane us tabake ko sapana dikhaa rahe the, jo maanata he ki bijepi aarakshan virdohi he
 The Dalit mps of the BJP also generally remained silent after the Sangh statement
 kya pradhanmantri yaa unki sarkaar ke baaki mantri paswan kii baat par kuch bolenge
 Therefore Paswan is taking this debate forward again, while the Prime Minister wants to stay on the status quo
 naksalwad kaa samaadhaan aarakshan ho saktaa he, paswan ne ek dilachasp baat kah di he
 If the Prime Minister is saying that there is a reservation right, will this right be extended to private sector companies
 
 
 ? sarkari thekon main anusuchit jati, janajati or alpsankhyakon ko praathamikta dekar naukari kaa vikalp nahin paidaa kiya ja saktaa he, lekin uskaa laabh to hota hi he
 Can it create a new tussle? 
 
 ? kya bijepi ke dalit saansad or vidhayak paswan ke is prastaav kaa samarthan karenge yaa party line par hi chalenge
 Mayawati also says this, but remains silent
 mira kumaar ne bhi kaaphi prayaas kiya tha, balki thos prayaas mira kumaar ne kendriya mantri rahete kiya tha
 Why did Paswan say such a thing that could again trouble the BJP or Modi government which is trying to repair its line on reservation
 kya vyaktigat upeksha ke kaaran yaa vaaki ise lekar vah aage badhane ja rahe hai
 The comments paswan hajipur se saat baar jite hai
 He held the record for winning the most votes from Hajipur
 railmantri bhi rahe or vipaksh main rahete hue kisi bhi rail bajet par unki pratikriya to hoti hi thi
 Recently there was a program of Prime Minister in Hajipur
 manch par hajipur kaa yah saansad maujuud tha, lekin bolne kaa mauka nahin mila
 In Hajipur, where Paswan has had thousands of arguments, in Hajipur, he could not say two words in the welcome and pride of his own Prime Minister in a train related program
 raajnneeti main jis vakt aap sher hote hai, usee vakt aap kuch nahin hote
 But the leader is the lion of time
 paswan vahaan to chup ho gaye, magar kahin or bol kar apni dahaad suna di
 What is the benefit of winning so many times and becoming a minister that you are not invited to speak two words in a meeting
 vah bhi tab, jab aap usee jagah se saansad bhi hon, mantri bhi
 Advocates of reservation in private companies and the government's policy to move the tribals towards Naxalism will not make Paswan a fresh Dalit leader any more, but he has taken a risk
 ho saktaa he, iske baad vah modi sarkaar ke bheetar kinare kar die jaaen, magar paswan ne apni jamaapunji ke aadhaar par daanv to laga hi diya he
 Even if they have indicated to strengthen their position, the government should understand that the issue of reservation is going to pose a new challenge within it
 har netaa apane aap main ek swytt praani hota he
 By losing that autonomy, he cannot enjoy the pleasure of the minister for a long time
 haalanki paswan or ajit singh mantri banane ke maamle main bharat ke sabase vyaavhaarik netaaon main se rahe hai
 Whatever it is, the debate of reservation is not over yet, and there is still to be a confrontation on this issue, which will test not only BJP but also other parties
 yah pataa hona zaruri he ki sarkarein vibhinn staron par kitne rojgaar paidaa karti hai
 What are their policies regarding permanent and temporary jobs
 kanoon ke tahat yah bhi bataaya janaa chahie ki asthaayee prakruti kii naukariyon kaa pratishat sthaayee kism kii naukariyon kii tulana main kitna he
 Professor Vivek Kumar says that there is usually no reservation in temporary jobs and now most of the jobs in government jobs are taken in this way
 agar yah sahi he to isaki bhi ginati honi chahie ki un asthaayee naukariyon main anusuchit jati, janajati varg ke kitnon logon ko jagah mili he
 First, the condition of temporary jobs is no less frightening
 arakshit ho yaa anarakshit, is tarah kii naukariyon main sab pis rahe hai
 Go to any state
 theke par kaam kar rahe shikshakon kii haalat bahut karaab he
 If there is a need and our leaders lie so much after education, then why not make the appointments of teachers transparent and better
 kyon nahin shikshak banane kii prakriya ko yogyata-aadhaarit or behatar banaaya jaataa
 Many departments are starting to outsource their work, which is creating less jobs in the government sector
 sawaal aarakshan ke rahane kaa to he hi, yah bhi to pataa chale ki sarkaar ke paas naukariyaan hai bhi yaa chali gayi, yaa unki prakruti badalakar aarakshan ko samaapt kar diya gaya
 The Prime Minister is repeatedly saying that no one can touch reservation
 aarakshan adhikaar he, lekin is bahes kii shuruyaat vipaksh ne shuru kii yaa aresas ne
 
 
 The The RSS has made a number of statements about reservation, ranging from review to reservation till the discrimination is eradicated from the society
 bijepi ko samarthan dene vaala naujavaanon kaa ek bada tabaka aarakshan-virdohi he
 From here and there, there is an attempt to keep the hope within him that something is happening or the discussion is starting on reservation
 ummid he, ab aise logon ko bijepi or sangh kii taraf se jawaab mil gaya hoga ki aarakshan koi nahin hataa saktaa
 There is a kind of casteism in their opposition to reservation too
 samiksha ke naam par sangh kii taraf se aisi baaten hoti hai, jinhen lekar ek bade varg main tarah-tarah kii ashankaayen failati hai
 Those who are pro-reservation, they should know what is the condition of jobs and reservation from state to center level
 jo aarakshan-virdohi hai, ve bhi pataa karen ki naukariyaan nikal rahi hai yaa nahin
 Reservation does not eat jobs, government consumes jobs
 jab naukariyaan hongi hi nahin, to unka laabh na aarakshan samarthakon ko milegaa, na virodhiyon ko
 If you do not understand such a simple thing, then nothing will be done by filling the page for reservation debate
 vahi daleelein aaj bhi di ja rahi hai, jo pehle di ja rahi thim
 People should force all governments to speak on the possibility of jobs, clarify policy and count
 agar isi tarah andhere main rahakar bhavukta se bahes kerani he, to vah aapaki marzi
 The Prime Minister has said the last thing on his behalf regarding reservation
 ummid he, unki party or sangh ke bheetar kii shakhaon ne saaf-saaf sun liya he
 Now since they could not dismiss the name of the Sangh, they took the name of the opposition
 raajnneeti main itnaa chalata he
 The Opposition may have given its response, but the RSS listened silently or gave its response silently after listening
 yah un logon kii badi jeet he, jinhen lag rahaa tha ki aarakshan ke haq ke liye sadak par utarane kii zarurat pad sakati he
 They won this battle again only in a minor debate
 isse zyada pasinaa to aarakshan virodhiyon ne twitor or fasebuk par baha diya
 But at the same time it is happening that the debate and politics challenging the reservation through the new contests of the classes is being given vent
 in maangon ke jariye bhraamak asahmatiyaan paidaa kii ja rahi hai
 You must have heard a statement by Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan on reservation
 yah bayaan sirf aarakshan ke liye mahatvapurn nahin he, balki ise dalit-adivasee varg kii bechainiyon ke sandarbh main padhaa janaa chahie
 Paswan has so far remained silent within the Narendra Modi government
 rohit vemula kii khudakushi kii ghatana ke baad unki party ne sakriyata dikhaai thi, magar paswan or unki party centre sarkaar ke saath hi khadey nazar aae
 Paswan said that the land of the tribals is being taken away
 unhen visthapit kar unki zamin se sona nikaala ja rahaa he
 If they do not get jobs, they will become Naxalites
 in dinon paswan kii sarkaar ke paale ke samarthakon kii taraf se naksalwadiyon ko deshadrohi bataane or deshadrohi ko naksalwadi bataane kaa chalan ho gaya he
 In that court, Paswan is the first leader who has dared to explain for the first time how Naxalism is born
 sarkaar kii nitiyon se paidaa ho rahaa he
 Is Paswan also saying that the process has been accelerated by the policies under which his government has distributed mining licenses in tribal areas, but his statement is a comment on the policies of all those governments
 pradhanmantri kah rahe hai ki aarakshan kaa adhikaar koi nahin le saktaa
 He is not saying anything new
 nai baat ramvilas paswan kah rahe hai
 Actually, the matter of reservation in private companies is also not new, but Paswan has done the courage to raise this question in this government
 khaskar tab, jab is sarkaar ke sahyogi yaa matra-sanghathanon ke log aarakshan kii samiksha ke bahaane us tabake ko sapana dikhaa rahe the, jo maanata he ki bijepi aarakshan virdohi he
 The Dalit mps of the BJP also generally remained silent after the Sangh statement
 kya pradhanmantri yaa unki sarkaar ke baaki mantri paswan kii baat par kuch bolenge
 Therefore Paswan is taking this debate forward again, while the Prime Minister wants to stay on the status quo
 naksalwad kaa samaadhaan aarakshan ho saktaa he, paswan ne ek dilachasp baat kah di he
 If the Prime Minister is saying that there is a reservation right, will this right be extended to private sector companies
 
 
 ? sarkari thekon main anusuchit jati, janajati or alpsankhyakon ko praathamikta dekar naukari kaa vikalp nahin paidaa kiya ja saktaa he, lekin uskaa laabh to hota hi he
 Can it create a new tussle? 
 
 ? kya bijepi ke dalit saansad or vidhayak paswan ke is prastaav kaa samarthan karenge yaa party line par hi chalenge
 Mayawati also says this, but remains silent
 mira kumaar ne bhi kaaphi prayaas kiya tha, balki thos prayaas mira kumaar ne kendriya mantri rahete kiya tha
 Why did Paswan say such a thing that could again trouble the BJP or Modi government which is trying to repair its line on reservation
 kya vyaktigat upeksha ke kaaran yaa vaaki ise lekar vah aage badhane ja rahe hai
 The comments paswan hajipur se saat baar jite hai
 He held the record for winning the most votes from Hajipur
 railmantri bhi rahe or vipaksh main rahete hue kisi bhi rail bajet par unki pratikriya to hoti hi thi
 Recently there was a program of Prime Minister in Hajipur
 manch par hajipur kaa yah saansad maujuud tha, lekin bolne kaa mauka nahin mila
 In Hajipur, where Paswan has had thousands of arguments, in Hajipur, he could not say two words in the welcome and pride of his own Prime Minister in a train related program
 raajnneeti main jis vakt aap sher hote hai, usee vakt aap kuch nahin hote
 But the leader is the lion of time
 paswan vahaan to chup ho gaye, magar kahin or bol kar apni dahaad suna di
 What is the benefit of winning so many times and becoming a minister that you are not invited to speak two words in a meeting
 vah bhi tab, jab aap usee jagah se saansad bhi hon, mantri bhi
 Advocates of reservation in private companies and the government's policy to move the tribals towards Naxalism will not make Paswan a fresh Dalit leader any more, but he has taken a risk
 ho saktaa he, iske baad vah modi sarkaar ke bheetar kinare kar die jaaen, magar paswan ne apni jamaapunji ke aadhaar par daanv to laga hi diya he
 Even if they have indicated to strengthen their position, the government should understand that the issue of reservation is going to pose a new challenge within it
 har netaa apane aap main ek swytt praani hota he
 By losing that autonomy, he cannot enjoy the pleasure of the minister for a long time
 haalanki paswan or ajit singh mantri banane ke maamle main bharat ke sabase vyaavhaarik netaaon main se rahe hai
 Whatever it is, the debate of reservation is not over yet, and there is still to be a confrontation on this issue, which will test not only BJP but also other parties
 awwal to asthaayee naukariyon kii dasha bhi kam bhayaavah nahin he
 Be it reserved or unreserved, everyone is crushed in such jobs
 aap kisi bhi rajya main chale jaaie
 The condition of contractual teachers is very bad
 agar zarurat he or hamaare netaa shiksha-shiksha kar itnaa jhooth bolte hi hai to shikshakon kii niyuktiyon ko paardarshee or behatar kyon nahin karte
 Why not make the process of becoming a teacher merit-based and better
 kai vibhaag apane kaam ko outsource karaane lage hai, jisase sarkari kshetra main naukariyaan kam paidaa ho rahi hai
 The question is whether the reservation should remain, it should also be known whether the government has jobs or gone, or the nature of reservation has been abolished by changing their nature
 pradhanmantri baar-baar kah rahe hai ki aarakshan ko koi haath nahin laga saktaa
 Reservation is right, but the debate started by the opposition or the RSS
 
 
 ? aresas ne aarakshan ko lekar kai tarah ke bayaan die, jinamein samiksha se lekar aarakshan tab tak rahane kii baat he, jab tak samaaj se bhedbhaav nahin mit jaataa
 a large section of youth supporting BJP is anti-reservation
 idhar-udhar kii baton se uske bheetar ummid jagaae rakhane kaa prayaas hota rahata he ki aarakshan ko lekar kuch ho rahaa he yaa charchaa kii shuruyaat ho rahi he
 Hopefully, now such people will have got the answer from BJP and Sangh that no one can remove reservation
 aarakshan ko lekar unke virodh main bhi ek kism kaa jatvaad to he hi
 In the name of review, there are such things on behalf of the Sangh, about which a wide range of fears spread
 jo log aarakshan samarthak hai, unhen pataa karnaa chahie ki rajya se lekar centre ke str tak naukariyon or aarakshan kii kya haalat he
 Those who are anti-reservation also find out whether jobs are going out or not
 naukariyon ko aarakshan nahin kha jaataa he, sarkaar naukariyaan kha jaati hai
 When there are no jobs, neither the supporters nor the opponents will get their benefits
 itani simpal baat nahin samaj pate to aarakshan kii bahes ko lekar panne bharne se kuch nahin hone vaala
 The same arguments are still being given today, which were given earlier
 logon ko tamaam sarkaron ko majaboor karnaa chahie ki ve apane yahaan naukariyon kii sambhaavna par bolen, niti spasht karen or ginati bhi bataaen
 If you have to argue in the dark with emotion, then it is your choice
 pradhanmantri ne aarakshan ko lekar apni taraf se antim baat kah di he
 Hopefully, his party and the branches within the Sangh have listened clearly
 ab chunki ve sangh kaa naam lekar khaarij nahin kar sakate the, to vipaksh kaa naam le liya
 So much goes on in politics
 vipaksh ne to apni pratikriya de di hogi, lekin aresas ne chup rahakar suna yaa sunne ke baad chup rahakar apni pratikriya de di he
 This is a big victory for those who felt that they may need to get on the road for the right to reservation
 maamuli bahes main hi ve yah ladaai phir jeet gaye
 More than that, reservation opponents swept through Twitter and Facebook
 lekin isi ke saath yah bhi ho rahaa he ki tarah-tarah virgon kii nai daavedaariyon ke jariye aarakshan ko chunauti dene vaali bahes or raajnneeti ko hawa di ja rahi he
 Confusing disagreements are being created through these demands
 aapane kendriya mantri ramvilas paswan kaa aarakshan par ek bayaan suna hoga
 This statement is not only important for reservation, but it should be read in the context of restlessness of the dalit-adivasi class
 paswan abhi tak narendra modi sarkaar ke bheetar chup hi rahe hai
 His party was active after Rohit Vemula's suicide incident, but Paswan and his party were seen standing alongside the central government
 paswan ne kaha ki adivaasiyon kii zamin chhini ja rahi he
 They are displaced and gold is being extracted from their land
 unhen naukariyaan nahin milengi to ve naksalwadi banenge
 These days there has been a trend from the supporters of Paswan's government to call the Naxalites as traitors and to describe the traitors as Naxalites
 us paale main paswan pehle netaa he, jinhone pehali baar himmat kar yah bataane kaa kaam kiya he ki naksalwad kaise paidaa hota he
 Is born out of government policies
 kya paswan yah bhi kah rahe hai ki unki sarkaar ne jin nitiyon ke tahat adivasee ilaakon main khanan ke license baante hai, unase bhi yah prakriya or tej hui he, lekin unka yah bayaan un tamaam sarkaron kii nitiyon par ek tippanee to he hi
 The Prime Minister is saying that no one can take the right to reservation
 vah koi nai baat nahin kah rahe hai
 Ram Vilas Paswan is saying a new thing
 darasal privet companiyon main aarakshan kii baat bhi nai nahin he, lekin is sarkaar main yah sawaal uthaane kaa saahas paswan ne hi kiya he
 Especially when the people of this government's affiliates or maternal organizations were dreaming of a section which believes that the BJP is anti-reservation
 bijepi ke dalit saansad bhi aamtaur par sangh ke bayaan ke baad chup hi rahe
 Will the Prime Minister or the rest of the ministers of his government say anything about Paswan
 isliye paswan is bahes ko phir se aage le ja rahe hai, jabaki pradhanmantri yathasthiti par tike rahanaa chaahate hai
 Reservation of Naxalism can be reservation, Paswan has said an interesting thing
 agar pradhanmantri yah kah rahe hai ki aarakshan adhikaar he, to kya is adhikaar kaa vistaar nijee kshetra kii companiyon tak hoga
 
 
 The In government contracts, job options cannot be created by giving priority to scheduled castes, tribes and minorities, but there are benefits
 kya yah koi nai khinchataan kii sthiti paidaa kar sakati he
 
 
 The Will the bjp's Dalit MP and MLA support Paswan's proposal or will he follow the party line only
 yah baat mayawati bhi kahati hai, magar chup rah jaati hai
 Meera Kumar had also made a lot of efforts, rather concrete efforts were made by Meera Kumar as Union Minister
 paswan ne aisi baat kyon kahi, jo aarakshan par apni line ko durust karne main lagi bijepi yaa modi sarkaar ko phir se pareshaani main daal sakati he
 Is he going to move forward because of personal neglect or really about it? tippaniyan Paswan has won seven times from Hajipur
 unhone hajipur se sabase adhik maton se jeetne kaa record banaaya tha
 He was also a railway minister and while in opposition, he used to react to any railway budget
 haal hi main pradhanmantri kaa ek kaarykram hua hajipur main
 This Hajipur MP was present on the stage, but did not get a chance to speak
 jis hajipur main paswan ne hazaron takreeren kii hon, us hajipur main rail se sambandhit ek kaarykram main apane hi pradhanmantri ke swaagat or shaan main do shabd nahin kah paae
 In politics, when you are a lion, you are nothing
 magar netaa vakt kaa sher hota he
 Paswan fell silent there, but spoke his roar elsewhere
 itani baar jeetne or mantri banane kaa kya laabh ki aap kisi sabha main do shabd bolne ke liye na bulaae jaaen
 That too when you are an MP from the same place, a minister too
 privet companiyon main aarakshan kii vakaalat or sarkari nitiyon kii vajah se adivaasiyon kaa naksalwad kii taraf jane kaa bayaan paswan ko nae sire se koi bada dalit netaa to ab nahin bana sakegaa, lekin unhone jokhim to liya he
 Maybe, after that he should be sidelined within the Modi government, but Paswan has placed bets on the basis of his deposits
 agar unhone apni sthiti ko majboot karne ke liye bhi sanket diya he, to bhi sarkaar ko samajhnaa chahie ki aarakshan kaa mudda uske bheetar nai chunauti khadi karne vaala he
 Every leader is an autonomous creature in itself
 us swaittata ko ganvaakar vah bahut din tak mantripad kaa sukh nahin bhoga saktaa
 However Paswan and Ajit Singh have been among the most pragmatic leaders in India in terms of becoming ministers
 jo bhi he, aarakshan kii bahes abhi khatm nahin hui he, or is masale par abhi or takaraav hona he, jo bijepi hi nahin, baaki dalon kaa bhi imtihaan legaa
 The Prime Minister is repeatedly saying that no one can touch reservation
 aarakshan adhikaar he, lekin is bahes kii shuruyaat vipaksh ne shuru kii yaa aresas ne

 jis hajipur main paswan ne hazaron takreeren kii hon, us hajipur main rail se sambandhit ek kaarykram main apane hi pradhanmantri ke swaagat or shaan main do shabd nahin kah paae
 In politics, when you are a lion, you are nothing
 magar netaa vakt kaa sher hota he
 Paswan fell silent there, but spoke his roar elsewhere
 itani baar jeetne or mantri banane kaa kya laabh ki aap kisi sabha main do shabd bolne ke liye na bulaae jaaen
 That too when you are an MP from the same place, a minister too
 privet companiyon main aarakshan kii vakaalat or sarkari nitiyon kii vajah se adivaasiyon kaa naksalwad kii taraf jane kaa bayaan paswan ko nae sire se koi bada dalit netaa to ab nahin bana sakegaa, lekin unhone jokhim to liya he
 Maybe, after that he should be sidelined within the Modi government, but Paswan has placed bets on the basis of his deposits
 agar unhone apni sthiti ko majboot karne ke liye bhi sanket diya he, to bhi sarkaar ko samajhnaa chahie ki aarakshan kaa mudda uske bheetar nai chunauti khadi karne vaala he
 Every leader is an autonomous creature in itself
 us swaittata ko ganvaakar vah bahut din tak mantripad kaa sukh nahin bhoga saktaa
 However Paswan and Ajit Singh have been among the most pragmatic leaders in India in terms of becoming ministers
 jo bhi he, aarakshan kii bahes abhi khatm nahin hui he, or is masale par abhi or takaraav hona he, jo bijepi hi nahin, baaki dalon kaa bhi imtihaan legaa
 The Prime Minister has said the last thing on his behalf regarding reservation
 ummid he, unki party or sangh ke bheetar kii shakhaon ne saaf-saaf sun liya he
 Now since they could not dismiss the name of the Sangh, they took the name of the opposition
 raajnneeti main itnaa chalata he
 The Opposition may have given its response, but the RSS listened silently or gave its response silently after listening
 yah un logon kii badi jeet he, jinhen lag rahaa tha ki aarakshan ke haq ke liye sadak par utarane kii zarurat pad sakati he
 They won this battle again only in a minor debate
 isse zyada pasinaa to aarakshan virodhiyon ne twitor or fasebuk par baha diya
 But at the same time it is happening that the debate and politics challenging the reservation through the new contests of the classes is being given vent
 in maangon ke jariye bhraamak asahmatiyaan paidaa kii ja rahi hai
 You must have heard a statement by Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan on reservation
 yah bayaan sirf aarakshan ke liye mahatvapurn nahin he, balki ise dalit-adivasee varg kii bechainiyon ke sandarbh main padhaa janaa chahie
 Paswan has so far remained silent within the Narendra Modi government
 rohit vemula kii khudakushi kii ghatana ke baad unki party ne sakriyata dikhaai thi, magar paswan or unki party centre sarkaar ke saath hi khadey nazar aae
 Paswan said that the land of the tribals is being taken away
 unhen visthapit kar unki zamin se sona nikaala ja rahaa he
 If they do not get jobs, they will become Naxalites
 in dinon paswan kii sarkaar ke paale ke samarthakon kii taraf se naksalwadiyon ko deshadrohi bataane or deshadrohi ko naksalwadi bataane kaa chalan ho gaya he
 In that court, Paswan is the first leader who has dared to explain for the first time how Naxalism is born
 sarkaar kii nitiyon se paidaa ho rahaa he
 Is Paswan also saying that the process has been accelerated by the policies under which his government has distributed mining licenses in tribal areas, but his statement is a comment on the policies of all those governments
 pradhanmantri kah rahe hai ki aarakshan kaa adhikaar koi nahin le saktaa
 He is not saying anything new
 nai baat ramvilas paswan kah rahe hai
 Actually, the matter of reservation in private companies is also not new, but Paswan has done the courage to raise this question in this government
 khaskar tab, jab is sarkaar ke sahyogi yaa matra-sanghathanon ke log aarakshan kii samiksha ke bahaane us tabake ko sapana dikhaa rahe the, jo maanata he ki bijepi aarakshan virdohi he
 The Dalit mps of the BJP also generally remained silent after the Sangh statement
 kya pradhanmantri yaa unki sarkaar ke baaki mantri paswan kii baat par kuch bolenge
 Therefore Paswan is taking this debate forward again, while the Prime Minister wants to stay on the status quo
 naksalwad kaa samaadhaan aarakshan ho saktaa he, paswan ne ek dilachasp baat kah di he
 If the Prime Minister is saying that there is a reservation right, will this right be extended to private sector companies
 
 
 ? sarkari thekon main anusuchit jati, janajati or alpsankhyakon ko praathamikta dekar naukari kaa vikalp nahin paidaa kiya ja saktaa he, lekin uskaa laabh to hota hi he
 Can it create a new tussle? 
 
 ? kya bijepi ke dalit saansad or vidhayak paswan ke is prastaav kaa samarthan karenge yaa party line par hi chalenge
 Mayawati also says this, but remains silent
 mira kumaar ne bhi kaaphi prayaas kiya tha, balki thos prayaas mira kumaar ne kendriya mantri rahete kiya tha
 Why did Paswan say such a thing that could again trouble the BJP or Modi government which is trying to repair its line on reservation
 kya vyaktigat upeksha ke kaaran yaa vaaki ise lekar vah aage badhane ja rahe hai
 The comments paswan hajipur se saat baar jite hai
 He held the record for winning the most votes from Hajipur
 railmantri bhi rahe or vipaksh main rahete hue kisi bhi rail bajet par unki pratikriya to hoti hi thi
 Recently there was a program of Prime Minister in Hajipur
 manch par hajipur kaa yah saansad maujuud tha, lekin bolne kaa mauka nahin mila
 In Hajipur, where Paswan has had thousands of arguments, in Hajipur, he could not say two words in the welcome and pride of his own Prime Minister in a train related program
 raajnneeti main jis vakt aap sher hote hai, usee vakt aap kuch nahin hote
 But the leader is the lion of time
 paswan vahaan to chup ho gaye, magar kahin or bol kar apni dahaad suna di
 What is the benefit of winning so many times and becoming a minister that you are not invited to speak two words in a meeting
 vah bhi tab, jab aap usee jagah se saansad bhi hon, mantri bhi
 Advocates of reservation in private companies and the government's policy to move the tribals towards Naxalism will not make Paswan a fresh Dalit leader any more, but he has taken a risk
 ho saktaa he, iske baad vah modi sarkaar ke bheetar kinare kar die jaaen, magar paswan ne apni jamaapunji ke aadhaar par daanv to laga hi diya he
 Even if they have indicated to strengthen their position, the government should understand that the issue of reservation is going to pose a new challenge within it
 har netaa apane aap main ek swytt praani hota he
 By losing that autonomy, he cannot enjoy the pleasure of the minister for a long time
 haalanki paswan or ajit singh mantri banane ke maamle main bharat ke sabase vyaavhaarik netaaon main se rahe hai
 Whatever it is, the debate of reservation is not over yet, and there is still to be a confrontation on this issue, which will test not only BJP but also other parties
 aapane kendriya mantri ramvilas paswan kaa aarakshan par ek bayaan suna hoga
 This statement is not only important for reservation, but it should be read in the context of restlessness of the dalit-adivasi class
 paswan abhi tak narendra modi sarkaar ke bheetar chup hi rahe hai
 His party was active after Rohit Vemula's suicide incident, but Paswan and his party were seen standing alongside the central government
 paswan ne kaha ki adivaasiyon kii zamin chhini ja rahi he
 They are displaced and gold is being extracted from their land
 unhen naukariyaan nahin milengi to ve naksalwadi banenge
 These days there has been a trend from the supporters of Paswan's government to call the Naxalites as traitors and to describe the traitors as Naxalites
 us paale main paswan pehle netaa he, jinhone pehali baar himmat kar yah bataane kaa kaam kiya he ki naksalwad kaise paidaa hota he
 Is born out of government policies
 kya paswan yah bhi kah rahe hai ki unki sarkaar ne jin nitiyon ke tahat adivasee ilaakon main khanan ke license baante hai, unase bhi yah prakriya or tej hui he, lekin unka yah bayaan un tamaam sarkaron kii nitiyon par ek tippanee to he hi
 The Prime Minister is saying that no one can take the right to reservation
 vah koi nai baat nahin kah rahe hai
 Ram Vilas Paswan is saying a new thing
 darasal privet companiyon main aarakshan kii baat bhi nai nahin he, lekin is sarkaar main yah sawaal uthaane kaa saahas paswan ne hi kiya he
 Especially when the people of this government's affiliates or maternal organizations were dreaming of a section which believes that the BJP is anti-reservation
 bijepi ke dalit saansad bhi aamtaur par sangh ke bayaan ke baad chup hi rahe
 Will the Prime Minister or the rest of the ministers of his government say anything about Paswan
 isliye paswan is bahes ko phir se aage le ja rahe hai, jabaki pradhanmantri yathasthiti par tike rahanaa chaahate hai
 Reservation of Naxalism can be reservation, Paswan has said an interesting thing
 agar pradhanmantri yah kah rahe hai ki aarakshan adhikaar he, to kya is adhikaar kaa vistaar nijee kshetra kii companiyon tak hoga
 
 
 The In government contracts, job options cannot be created by giving priority to scheduled castes, tribes and minorities, but there are benefits
 kya yah koi nai khinchataan kii sthiti paidaa kar sakati he
 
 
 The Will the bjp's Dalit MP and MLA support Paswan's proposal or will he follow the party line only
 yah baat mayawati bhi kahati hai, magar chup rah jaati hai
 Meera Kumar had also made a lot of efforts, rather concrete efforts were made by Meera Kumar as Union Minister
 paswan ne aisi baat kyon kahi, jo aarakshan par apni line ko durust karne main lagi bijepi yaa modi sarkaar ko phir se pareshaani main daal sakati he
 Is he going to move forward because of personal neglect or really about it? tippaniyan Paswan has won seven times from Hajipur
 unhone hajipur se sabase adhik maton se jeetne kaa record banaaya tha
 He was also a railway minister and while in opposition, he used to react to any railway budget

 When the Modi government is just thirty days away from its third budget, it is not at all difficult to realize that if the missions like Swachhta, Digital India, Ganga Safai are solidly connected to budgetary policies and spending programs, then they will be able to overcome the recession and restore employment There was a way to do it
 sarkaar ke galiyaaron main tahaltey or khabaron ko soonghtey hue yah andaja lag jaataa he ki modi sarkaar ab apane faisle kii samiksha ke daur main he
 Fueled by the missions and campaigns of nearly two and a half dozen schemes, the government is restless in search of the ground effect that should have been seen after so many attempts

 It seems that perhaps the foundations for projects and allocations were not placed below the preference forts
 agar aisa hua hota to kai mishan audyogic growth kii gaadi main maang or nae rojgaron kaa eendhan bhar sakate the
 As a sample, Swachhta and Digital India can be taken as missions which are purely economic and infrastructure services, which the government has converted into publicity campaigns with symbols of public participation and limited economic results

 When the government was expected to announce concrete projects for the cleanliness mission in the 2015 budget, it was linked to public consciousness and the hygiene mission's glasses started to get clouded

 If sanitation is taken out of the debates of habit and awareness, then it is a 100 percent economic service that demands the same kind of infrastructure, technology, people, expertise, investment which is probably any other economic service like irrigation, railway or telecommunications

 Unfortunately, this is the last budget for the Modi government to do so as the budgets of 2017 and 2018 will be made in the shadow of election of ten states and those budgets will not get such an opportunity to show financial economic management and to cope with recession

 The clash between the MCD and the Delhi government may once again escalate over the open fever clinic on the pavement in Paschim Vihar
 north emsidi ne footpath par fever clinics kholane ko avaidh bataate hue peedblyoody ko chitti likh footpath par bane fever clinics ko hataane ko kaha he
 MCD officials argue that according to DMC Act, PWD will only look for maintenance of roads more than 60 feet wide and will be cleared by the MCD before any construction on it

 In 2012, the MCD handover over 60 feet of wide roads to the PWD
 emsidi kii is aapatti ke baad jab 'aaj tak' kii team vahaan pahunchi, to paaya ki footpath par dhaancha bana to he, lekin wo footpath pehle se hi istemaal laayak nahin he

 The MCD may have knocked the door of the Governor in this case, but Delhi Health Minister Satinder Jain has made it clear that such structures will not be removed for the time being

 When the demonetisation took place on 8 November 2016, nobody knew as Prime Minister

 But demonetisation can happen again, everyone has come to know and that too from TV
 niti ayog ke chairman pradhanmantri hote hai or upaadhyaksh hote hai rajeev kumaar
 Rajiv Kumar has told Srinivasan Jain that for cleaning the economy, he would like to ban demonetization any day so that it can be formalized
 tex bharne kii aadat main sudhaar ho
 According to Niti Aayog vice-chairman Rajiv Kumar, he would like to demonetise anytime to improve the tax filing habit
 duniya bhar main kai desh hai jahaan tex bharne kii aadat is vakt bhi bharat se behatar se hogi, lekin kya vahaan aadat main ye sudhaar notebandi se ai he
 Then there should be demonetisation wherever tax evasion occurs
 khud ko notebandi kaa samarthak kehane vaale rajeev kumaar kehete hai ki ve naitik aadhaar par zyada samarthan karte hai
 This was done in order to bring purity and honesty in our social and economic behavior

 Ved Jain has also been the former president of the Institute of Chartered Accountants

 While the rate of increase of income tax returns is not much different before and after demonetisation
 kya iskar ritern badhaane ke liye notebandi hi ekmaatr upaay tha
 Whatever has increased, a large part of it belongs to the income tax payers who submitted the returns but did not pay taxes, because they were not able to pay tax
 is bare main bhi virend jain se hamane baat kii
 So Rajiv Kumar is so sure about demonetisation that he is talking about implementing it again

 In Simple Samachar, Onindyo Chakravati has told how 85% tax is charged on petrol
 85 percent tex aap tab bhi de rahe the jab antarrashtriya bazaar main kachche tel kii keemat 46 dollar prati bairal thi
 First look at that part and then move on
 onin ne dilli ke daam ke hisaab se samajhaayaa he jahaan petrol kii keemat 79 rupee 31 paise prati litre ho gaya
 Petrol in Delhi has become expensive by 2 rupees 17 paise between August 16 and September 4
 deazal 2 rupee 62 paise ke hisaab se mahangaa hua he
 The comments vaise khabar yahi aa rahi he ki tex main katautee kar tel ke daam ghataane kaa koi iraadaa nahin he sarkaar kaa

 Sushil Mahapatra went to the petrol pump and spoke to the motorcyclists

 It is true that the opposition is not an India closed-type demonstration that used to be in the 2013 era, because those people are now in the government, then obviously they should not expect a demonstration from them

 The major target of demonetisation was that 2 to 3 lakh crores of black money would not flow into banks
 ab jab kareeb kareeb sara paisa waapas aa gaya, to is sawaal ko chhod baaki saare pahalu par jor diya ja rahaa he
 We talked to tax expert Ved Jain
 veda jain institute of charted acountents ke purv adhyaksh bhi rahe hai
 Arguments are being made to declare the demonetisation successful that the income tax returns have increased
 jabaki iskar ritern badhane kii dar notebandi ke pehle or baad main koi khaas alag nahin he
 Was demonetisation the only way to increase income tax returns
 jo bhi badha he, uskaa bada hissaa un ykardaataaon kaa he jinhone ritern to jamaa kiye magar tex nahin die, kyonki tex dene laayak unki aamadani nahin thi

 Quickly close your eyes, so that everything is remembered at once
 ab rupye ko bhi yaad kar lijie
 The price of one dollar was 71 rupees 50 paise
 bharat ke itihaas main rupaya itnaa kabhi nahin gira tha
 But whether the rupee is falling for different reasons in 2018, are the reasons for its fall due to falling in 2013 when one dollar 68 on a day in August 2013
 8 rupee kaa ho gaya tha
 Why then from that Narendra Modi to Sushma Swaraj linked its fall with the fall of the Prime Minister and India's credibility
 ab jab rupaya usase bhi adhik gira he tab ve kin kaarnon se jodna chahenge
 On September 4, the rupee is worth one dollar 71

 At the same time, from 1947, you saw 1 dollar was equal to 1 rupee, which in 2013 became 69 rupees
 yani is dauraan congress ke raaj main 69 rupaya kamazor hua
 The current rupee weakened by 3 rupees

 susheel mahapatra petrol pump par gaye or motorcycle chalaane waalon se baat kii

 The spot-fixing case rocked the entire cricket world 3 years ago, Pakistan's tainted trio (mohammad Asif, Salman Butt, Mohammad Aamir) were also banned

 Taliban raiders turned a common day of Army Public School and College (APSC) into a never-ending tragic day

 It is one of the deadliest attacks ever conducted in Pakistan and the most horrific terrorist attack on children in the world since the 2004 Beslan school massacre in Russia
 ‘‘aatank se dahala pakistan’’ pehle panne kii binar surkhi hi nahin balki is katleam se desh main uthe gusse ke gubaar kaa aks bhi he
 But in a way, it is also a natural and natural expression of a country that has been playing snake-ladder games with Islamic terrorists and has always won in doubt because of the occasional attacks from their side
 america par 2001 main alqaida ke hamale ke baad duniya main aatankwaad ke khilaaf shuru hui jang main shaamil hone ke baad se pakistan main 50,000 se zyada log maare ja chuke hai
 As before, this time also the people of Pakistan have demanded from their government to take decisive steps to crush Islamic terrorism
 is traasadee ke turant baad kam se kam pakistani sarkaar ke jawaab main kuch fark jarur dikhaa he
 Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who was shaken to death in Peshawar on Tuesday, vowed that "martyrs will avenge every drop of blood of children
" ’’ is disha main sabase pehle unhone aatankwaadiyon ko faansee dene par chah saal se laga pratibandh hataane kaa elaan kar diya
 It is believed that till now this ban had raised the spirits of the terrorists so much that they were wandering without fearless attack
 sharif ne isse bhi ahm elaan yah kiya ki pakistan ‘‘achche or bure taliban’’ main fark karnaa band kar degaa
 He claimed that the whole country is united to defeat terrorism and plans to deal with it will be decided within a week
 ye majboot iraade sadakon par umad rahe gusse ke sailaab ke pratik lagate hai

" yah ilaaka lambey samay se duniya main aatankwaad kaa garh mana jaataa rahaa he
 Some more experts say that the extremist ideology has deep roots in Pakistani society and effective strategy has to be adopted to destroy it
 lekin yahaan se kuch sawaal uthanaa swaabhaavik hai
 Has that decisive moment come, which will force Pakistan to abandon its wavering policy on terror and put an end to this Bhasmasura? Will the government, military and religious intentions really unite to wipe out terrorists? Is Pakistan willing to abandon the militants that it has always used to dominate Afghanistan and incite extremism in Kashmir? Or is this another barrage of anger, which will end with bloodshed or over time? Under pressure from the American population, Pakistan in June named zarb-e-azb on the Taliban stronghold in the tribal region of North Waziristan
 The military action was initiated in which over 1,800 terrorists are reported to be wiped out

 By the way, when the war on terror started under the leadership of America, Pakistan too joined it and left the Taliban regime in Afghanistan
 lekin is baat ko sab jaanate hai ki pakistan kii sarkaar ne bharat virdohi guton ke saath-saath ‘‘achche talibanya ko samarthan dena jari rakhaa taaki afghanistan main uske ranneetik hit surakshit rahen
 After this change in policy, the terrorists called "bad Taliban" pointed their guns at Pakistan

 Sartaj Aziz, considered as Pakistan's foreign minister, created a sensation in November by saying that the "good Taliban" fighting the US are not Pakistan's plight
 unhone kaha tha, ‘‘ham bila vajah america ke dushmano ko apana dushman kyon banaaen? america ne jab afghanistan par hamalaa kiya tha to hamane jinhen bhi training di thi or hathiyaar die the sab ko pakistan kii taraf dhakel diya gaya
 Some of them were dangerous for us and some were not

 Experts say that if Pakistan wants to get rid of Islamic terrorism, then there is no way other than eliminating the terrorists without any discrimination
 suraksha visheshgy or ritred general talat masood kaa kahana he, ‘‘achche or bure taliban kaa antar khatm hona chahie
 Thinking of strategic penetration and needs in Afghanistan must be buried
 ’’visheshgy yah bhi kehete hai ki fouj akele aatankwaadiyon kaa safaya nahin kar sakati

 Sharif's declaration of not making a difference between "good and bad Taliban" is a big thing in itself because the government of Pakistan has declared this publicly for the first time

 In July last year, when Nitish Kumar broke away from RJD and formed a government with BJP, the same question was raised

 Whereas Janata Dal u and BJP had staked their claim under the post-poll alliance

 i realised with the feedback that a lot of women struggle with it 
 i think it's cool if a mom wants to move completely to formula or only BF or balance both
 There is no shame and no one can define what’s the perfect way

 The RJD has reacted sharply to the change of the head of the CBI team probing the creation scam
 sibiai ne is maamle kii jaanch kar rahe team ke eespi es ke maalik kii jagah eespi en mahato ko team kaa nayaa incharge banaaya gaya he
 RJD spokesperson Shakti Singh Yadav says that in the CBI investigation being conducted by Sranjan Mahaghotale, only an FIR is being lodged only on small fish while the wires of this scam are connected to the top of power
 bihar sarkaar par nishaanaa sadhate hue shakti singh ne kaha ki sarkaar ke sangyaan main rahane ke baavjood bhi is par koi dhyaan nahin diya balki lut kii chhot dekar khajaane ko lutaaya gaya
 It would be dishonest to expect a fair investigation as long as the conspirators of this entire scam and the perpetrator of 120 / b hold the power chair
 unhone kaha ki gaiyr bijepi shasit rajyon main vipaksh ke netaaon ke prati sibiai kaa ravaiya jitna tatparta purna rahata he jisaki baangi desh ke kai log dekh bhi rahe hai or vyapam hi sabase bada namoona he
 Questioning the CBI, the RJD spokesperson said that if the CBI will be used to protect its people and allies of the alliance, then the institution's credibility is certain to be discounted
 unhone kaha kichaara ghotaale maamlemen sibiai ke adhikariyon ne jis tarah sajeesh kaa aarope lalu yadav par lagaaya tha jabaki chaara ghotaale maamle main jaanch kaa aadesh bhi swayan lalu prasad ne hi diya tha
 Shakti Singh said that there was no separate budgetary provision for animal husbandry
 srijan maamle main jaanch ko bhi dabaaya gaya or har prakaar ke dhyaan aakarshan ko nakaarkar srijan maamle seakut sampati dhan sangrahakarne kii chhot di gayi
 The CBI should investigate the entire case without ranting and register the FIR by making the conspirator a named accused soon
 unhone kaha ki nishpaksh jaanch se hi doodh kaa doodh or pani kaa pani hoga
 This thing in the minds of common people lagata he chunavi mausam kaa asar manmohan singh par dikhne laga he

 'this alleged statement has been published in an influential daily in Pakistan, which has been denied

 The tussle between the Congress and JDS alliance in Karnataka has increased
 donon partiyon ke netaaon kii ore se pichley kuch maheenon main jubaani jang jari he
 On Monday, Karnataka JDS President Vishwanath attacked the former CM and Congress leader Siddaramaiah fiercely
 unhone kaha, siddharmaiya 5 saal siem rahe or isaki shekhi baghaarte hai
 If that was the case, why did their seats fall from 125 to 79
 agar unhone acchhee sarkaar chalaai to 130 se ghatakar 79 par kyon aa gaye
 On this statement of Vishwanath, Congress MLA ST Somasekhar defended Siddaramaiah, saying, "he is an elephant
" kute hathi ko dekhakar bhunkate hai
 If 100 people praise Siddaramaiah then it does not enter his mind
 agar 100 log unki aalochana karte hai to unhen fark nahin padataa
 She is an elephant
 vah netaa hai''
 On the other hand, BJP MP from Karnataka's Udupi seat Shobha Karandlaje supported Vishwanath
 unhone kaha, ''jo bhi vishwanath ne bolaa, vah sahi he
 Siddaramaiah is a failed chief minister
 unhone koi kaam nahin kiya
 He wants to divide society and religion to come to power
 '' shobhaa ne loksabhaa main congress ke netaa pratipaksh mallikarjun khadge par bhi hamalaa bolaa
 He said, Kharge is frustrated
 vah kalburgi loksabhaa seat nahin jeet jayega
 Dr
 Jadhav will defeat him
 congress upachunaav bhi nahin jeet rahi he
 Earlier, while attacking the JDS president, Siddaramaiah had said that Vishwanath's statements smell of jealousy
 is bare main main cordination kamity main hi baat kahuunga
 Former CM said, first GT Deve Gowda said, now Vishwanath
 pataa nahin aage koun kahegaa
 It is better that the JDS take cognizance of the statements of its leaders
 karnataka kii 224 sadasyon vaali vidhansabha main bhaajapa ke 104, congress ke 77, jedies ke 37, basapa kaa ek, ek nirdaleey, kepijepi kaa ek vidhayak or ek spikar he
 On May 19, there will be voting for the by-election for Kundagol assembly seats
 karnataka bijepi ke pradesh adhyaksh bies yediurppa ne daawa kiya he ki gathbandhan (jedies or congress) ke 20 vidhayak unke sampark main hai
 One reason for the rage between the Congress and the JDS is that the vote of the two parties was not transferred to each other in the Lok Sabha
 jedies vidhayak suresh gauda ne aarope lagaate hue kaha ki congress vidhayakon ne mandya main bhaajapa ko vot diya he
 Gowda asked whom the Congress people want to become PM

 By next year, mainstream banking services will be extended to all villages with more than 2,000 population and remote areas
 bhartiya rigerv bank (arabiai) ke kaaryakari nideshak deepak kumaar mohanti ne samvaadadaataaon ko bataaya ki garibon ko soodakhoron se bachaane or puure desh main sabhi vayaskon ko banking seva uplabdh karaane ke liye parmparik bank pranali main dhire-dhire badlaav kiye ja rahe hai
 RBI has asked all banks to reinstate retired bank personnel and locals as business correspondents in areas where bank branches cannot be set up, so that all adults can be given banking facilities
 arabiai apni 75veen varshganth ke samarohon ke tahat 2009 se desh bhar main gaanvon, kasbon or dur-daraaj ke kshetron main vittiya shiviron kaa aayojan kar rahaa he
 Through this, it is making the general public aware of the illegal activities of banking services, non-banking financial companies (nbfcs) and institutions
 saath hi sabhi tak banking sevaayen pahunchane kii koshish kar rahaa he
 Mohanty along with other bank officials had come to attend a similar camp at Garjanmura, 65 km from Agartala
 unke saath arabiai kii guwahati kshetra kii nideshak surekha marandi bhi thim
 Mohanty and Marandi said that the RBI will set up a few more branches in the region to monitor the financial activities in the northeast regions
 ye shakhaaen arunachal pradesh, nagaland, manipur, mizoram, tripura or meghalaya main sthapit kii jaaengi
 E-commerce gave people the option of selling old and unused items in their homes and offices
 vahiin yadi ghar yaa offis se aise phaltu saamaan khud ba khud gaayab ho jaaen to kitna acha ho
 In politics, Nitish Kumar's abandonment of the Grand Alliance proved to be something like this and the stuff that was not in use from the opposition camp was automatically removed
 mahagathbandhan kii shuruyaat se hi yah myth rahaa ki nitish kumaar vipaksh ke saath hai
 His presence in this opposition was merely to lead the government in Bihar and he was getting nothing more than this
 nitish mukhyamantri pad par baithe rahe or mahagathbandhan ise modi ke khilaaf apni badi jeet samajhataa rahaa
 At the same time, after becoming the Chief Minister, Nitish remained silent either at the state level and the national level, otherwise he kept on using the least words to protest against BJP and Modi
 beete saal jab centre main narendra modi sarkaar ne notebandi kaa elaan kiya to puraa vipaksh is mudde par lamaband hone laga
 But Nitish Kumar came out in favor of the decision of the Modi government and set off the opposition's mobilization
 nateeja ye rahaa ki notebandi jaise ahm mudde par vipaksh kii puri ladaai main nitish kumaar kaa koi role nahin tha
 The same result was seen once again when Sonia Gandhi tried to unite the entire opposition to choose a new president
 nitish na sirf is kavayad se dur rahe balki aage badhkar virdohi kheme main ranneeti banane main lag gaye
 This was another occasion when the opposition was looking forward to Nitish and he just got cheated
 bihar chunaavon main nitish kii jeet sirf unke dam par nahin hui
 This victory was of the entire grand alliance in which Lalu Prasad Yadav's RJD emerged as the largest party
 lihaaja, bataur mukhyamantri or mahagathbandhan kaa hissaa hone ke kaaran unhen gathbandhan main shaamil sabhi netaaon or vidhayakon ke saath baithkar mudde ko sulajhane kii koshish karne kii jarurat thi
 But his strategy was different
 mahaj kuch ghanton main nitish bihar kii political script ko badalakar, vipaksh kaa saath pakad dobaaraa mukhyamantri ban gaye
 One thing is clear from these examples that Nitish Kumar was never part of the grand alliance
 vah hameshaa gathbandhan ke saath hote hue bhi khud ko alag khadaa karne kii kavayad main lage rahe
 At the same time, after this deception of the Grand Alliance from Nitish, there are important signals from other opposition political parties
 mamata banerjee modi ke saamne jhukne ke liye taiyaar nahin, lalu prasad mayawati ko loksabhaa ke raste sansad pahunchane kii baat kah rahe hai
 Hence, Nitish's move is preparing the opposition to take a more strict stand against Modi

 Union Minister of State for Drinking Water and Sanitation and BJP BJP leader Ram Kripal Yadav has claimed that Nitish Kumar and Lalu Prasad Yadav's alliance for the Bihar assembly elections will not last
 loksabhaa chunaav ke pehle rashtriya janata dal chhodir bijepi main aae yadav ne india today se baatcheet main kaha ki nitish ke raaj main sabase zyada atyaachaar rashtriya janata dal ke kor voter par hua he
 This voter has longed for the job of a peon
 yadav ne kaha, ‘‘log peeth kii maar to bardaasht kar sakate hai, lekin pet kii maar bardaasht nahin kar sakate
 "yadav's gesture was towards the Yadav community being angry with Nitish
 kendriya mantri ne daawa kiya nitish or lalu kii raajnneeti lambey samay se ek-duusare ke khilaaf rahi he
 In such a situation, if the leaders get a hug even then it will not be easy for the workers to digest it
 is sawaal par ki janata parivaar ne to nitish ko apana cheharaa maan liya he, aise main bijepi kaa cheharaa koun hoga? yadav ne kaha, ‘‘chunaav se pehle kendriya netritv mukhyamantri kaa cheharaa tay kar legaa

 The main basis of the latest alliance is to bring this minority voter under one flag instead of shattering it

 sapa gathbandhan par shila dikshit ne kaha- mujhe pataa nahin kya hua, lekin akhilesh or samaajawaadee party ke saath gathbandhan kii khabaren aane lageen
 In an interview 10 days before the alliance, i said that if there is such an alliance, i want to stay away from it, because there cannot be two candidates for CM
 mujhe nahin lagata ki ye ek acha faisalaa tha, kyonki ham saat seat par simat gaye
 This is very disturbing
 jis tarah se ham taiyaari kar rahe the hamen 50-70 siten aane kii ummid thi
 Regarding Rahul Gandhi, Sheila said that when Sonia Gandhi became the Congress President, she used to give 2-3 hours time to the AICC office every day
 mujhe lagata he ki agar rahul gandhi bhi aisa karen or logon se milen to puraa maahaul badal saktaa he
 Only leaders like Rahul can do this

 i don't think it was a good decision, because we were reduced to seven seats
 ye bahut hi pareshaan karne vaali baat he
 The way we were preparing we were expecting 50-70 seats
 rahul gandhi ko lekar shila ne kaha jab sonia gandhi congress adhyaksh bani thim to vah har din AICC daphtar main 2-3 ghante vakt detii thim

 rahul jaise netaa hi aisa kar sakate hai
 The comments aap kah rahi thim ki raajnneeti main vinamrata kii kami ho gai he, lekin kya congress main aisa zyaada ho rahaa he? shila dikshit ne is sawaal ke jawaab par kaha- haa vinamrata kam ho gai he, main ye maanati hum
 Otherwise, the leader does not leave such a party
 kuch samay baad aap siem nahin rahete, mantri nahin rahete lekin vah party ke mahatvapurn sadsy hote hai, isliye unhen utani to izzat to milani chahie
