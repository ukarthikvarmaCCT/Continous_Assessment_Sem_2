 Laxmi Devi fast is kept on Friday
 ise 'vaibhav lakshmi vrath' bhi kaha jaataa he
 This fast can be done by any man or woman
 is vrath ko karne se upaask ko dhan or sukh-samruddhi kii prapti hoti he
 This fast is also useful for maintaining Lakshmi's abode in the family
 is din stri-purush lakshmi kii puja karte hue safed phool, safed chandan aadi se puja karte hai
 Offer prasad by offering pudding to God with Kheer
 is vrath ke din upaask ko ek samay bhojan karnaa chahie
 If a person observes Mata Vaibhav Lakshmi fast and installs Lakshmi Shri Yantra and worships him regularly, then his business increases and wealth increases
 vaibhav lakshmi vrath kii katha:kisi shahar main anek log rahete the
 All were engaged in their work
 kisi ko kisi kii parvaah nahin thi
 Rites like bhajan-kirtan, bhakti-bhava, mercy-maya, altruism were reduced
 shahar main buraaiyaan bad gai thim
 Alcohol, gambling, race, adultery, robbery, robbery, etc
 were committed in many crimes in the city
 inke baavjood shahar main kuch achche log bhi rahete the
 Sheila and her husband were considered to be family members in such people
 shila dharmik prakruti kii or santoshi swabhaav vaali thi
 Her husband was also prudent and intelligent
 shila or uskaa pati kabhi kisi kii buraai nahin karte the or prabhu bhajan main acchhee tarah samay vyateet kar rahe the
 The people of the city appreciated his family
 dekhte hi dekhte samay badal gaya
 Sheila's husband befriends bad people
 ab vah jald se jald karodpati banane ke khwab dekhne laga
 Therefore, he started on the wrong path and as a result he became Rodapati yani raste par bhatakate bhikhaari jaisi uski haalat ho gai thi
 Sheela's husband also got caught in bad habits like alcohol, gambling, race, weed and marijuana
 doston ke saath use bhi sharaab kii aadat ho gai
 Thus he lost everything in race-gambling
 shila ko pati ke bartaav se bahut dukh hua, kintu vah bhagwaan par bharosa kar sabakuch sahane lagi
 She started spending most of her time in piety
 achaanak ek din dopaher ko unke dwaar par kisi ne dastak di
 Sheela opened the door and saw that a manji was standing
 uske chehre par alokik tej nikhar rahaa tha
 As if nectar was flowing from his eyes
 uskaa bhavy cheharaa karunaa or pyaar se chhalak rahaa tha
 Sheela had a lot of peace on seeing her
 shila ke rome-rome main anand chaa gaya
 Sheela brought the man in the house with respect
 ghar main bithaane ke liye kuch bhi nahin tha
 So Sheela shrugged and placed him on a torn sheet
 manji boleen- kyon shila! mujhe pahachaanaa nahin? har shuukravaar ko lakshmi ke mandir main bhajan-kirthan ke samay main bhi vahaan aati hum
 'despite this, Sheila could not understand anything
 phir manji boleen- 'tum bahut dinon se mandir nahin ain atah main tumhen dekhne chali ai
 'sheela's heart melted with Manji's very loving words
 uski ankhon main aansu aa gaye or vah bilakh-bilkhakar rone lagi
 Manji said- 'daughter! Happiness and sorrow are like sunshine and shade
 dhairya rakho beti! mujhe teri sari pareshaani bataa
 Sheila got a lot of support from Manji's behavior and in the hope of happiness, she told Manji all her story
 kahani sunakar maanji ne kaha- 'karm kii gati nyaari hoti he
 Every human has to suffer his deeds
 isliye tu chintaa mat kar
 Now you have suffered karma
 ab tumhaare sukh ke din avashya aayenge
 You are a devotee of Goddess Lakshmi
 maan lakshmi to prem or karunaa kii avatar hai
 She always keeps affection on her devotees
 isliye tu dhairya rakhkar maan lakshmi kaa vrath kar
 This will fix everything
 'shila ke poochne par manji ne use vrath kii sari vidhi bhi bataai
 Manji said- 'daughter! Maa Lakshmiji's fast is very simple
 use 'varadalakshmi vrath' yaa 'vaibhav lakshmi vrath' kaha jaataa he
 All the wishes of this fast are fulfilled
 vah sukh-sampatti or yash praapt karata he
 Sheila was happy to hear this
 shila ne sankalp karke ankhen kholi to saamne koi na tha
 She was surprised where Manji went? Sheela did not take any time to understand that Manji was none other than Lakshmi
 duusare din shuukravaar tha
 After bathing in the morning and wearing clean clothes, Sheela fasted whole heartedly with the method given by Manji
 aakhri main prasad vitaran hua
 This prasad was fed to the first husband
 prasad khate hi pati ke swabhaav main fark pad gaya
 That day he did not kill Sheela, he did not even persecute
 shila ko bahut anand hua
 In his mind, reverence for 'vaibhavalakshmi Vrat' increased
 shila ne purna shraddha-bhakthi se ikkis shuukravaar tak 'vaibhavalakshmi vrath' kiya
 According to the instructions of Manji on the twenty-first Friday, by doing the Udyan Vidhi, seven women gifted seven books of 'vaibhavalakshmi Vrat'
 phir mataji ke 'dhanalakshmi swaroop' kii chhabi ko vandan karke bhav se man hi man prarthana karne lageen- 'he maa dhanalakshmi! maine aapkaa 'vaibhavalakshmi vrath' karne kii mannath maani thi, vah vrath aaj purna kiya he
 Hey mother Remove all my troubles
 hamaara sabakaa kalyaan karo
 To give birth to someone who does not have children
 saubhagyawati stri kaa saubhaahgya akhand rakhana
 Give a pleasing husband to a virgin girl
 jo aapkaa yah chamatkaari vaibhavalakshmi vrath kare, unki sab vipatti dur karnaa
 Make everyone happy
 he maan! aapaki mahima apaar he
 Saying this, i saluted the image of Lakshmiji's 'dhanalakshmi Swaroop'
 vrath ke prabhaav se shila kaa pati acha aadmi ban gaya or kadi mehnat karke vyavsaay karne laga
 He immediately rescued Sheila's mortgaged jewelry
 ghar main dhan kii baadh si aa gai
 The same happiness and peace took place in the house
 'vaibhavalakshmi vrath' kaa prabhaav dekhakar mohalle kii duusari striyaan bhi vidhipurvak 'vaibhavalakshmi vrath' karne lageen
 'vaibhava Lakshmi Vrat' Udayan method: Seven, eleven or twenty-one, as many as Friday's vow is required, this fast should be done with full reverence and feeling till Friday
 aakhri shuukravaar ko iskaa shastreey vidhi ke anusaar udhyapan karnaa chahie
 Kheer should be prepared for Prasad on the last Friday
 jis prakaar har shuukravaar ko ham pujan karte hai, vaise hi karnaa chahie
 After worshiping, in front of the mother, break a quince, then at least seven virgin girls or fortunate women should give tilak of kumkum and gift one copy of the book of Maa Vaibhavalakshmi Vrat Katha and offer kheer to everyone
 iske baad maan lakshmi ko shraddha sahit pranaam karnaa chahie
 Then after worshiping the image of Mother's' Dhanalakshmi Swaroop ', pray with heart to heart -' o Mother Dhanalakshmi! i made a vow to do 'vaibhavalakshmi Vrat', that fast is completed today
 he maan! hamaari (jo manokamana ho vah bole) manokamana purna karen

 itnaa to sab kehete hai ki hamaare desh kii jidipi thik hone vaali he, phir logon kaa beepi kam kyon nahin ho rahaa he
 Why are people unable to understand the optimism of Prime Minister Modi and rating agency Moody? aisi bahason main kyon ulajhein jisase mudi ko bhi fark nahin pad rahaa he
 Homecoming, love jihad, Ramzade, intolerance, wrestling through cow meat, patriotism, traitor, freely turning right to left, we have now come to Bharat Mata ki Jai
 bich bich main brake lekar vandemataram par bhi bahes kar lete hai magar letest to vahi he ki koun bolegaa or koun nahin bolegaa
 The good thing is that despite all this, harmony remains, the good thing is that without humor it remains
 zaruri he ki ham hansen
 On top of you, above you and also above those who take themselves very serially
 hamaara kehanaam he ki hansega india to badhegaa india
 You recognize this headquarters where there is a speech every day, but if it is in Hindi, then it becomes very big
 sanyukt raashtra duniya bhar main khushhaali par ek report nikaalata he jinamein un deshon main bhi khushi khoji jaati he jo kuposhan ke shikaar hai
 Since 2012, the United Nations has considered removing the Happiness Index
 apane bharat kaa sthaan 118waan he
 We are ranked 118 among 157 countries
 ham itane kam khush kyon hai
 Do we Indians laugh after 117 countries
 wet karte hai ki pehle denmark hans le phir sweetzaraland hans le tab jaakar hansenge
 It is absolutely wrong
 had ho gai he
 Pakistan also laughs before us when we see this list
 wo 92wein number par he
 China laughs before both Pakistan and India, which means number 83
 main to bardaasht nahin kar paa rahaa ki apana bharat jahaan bharat mata ko lekar itani jang ho rahi he wo prasannataa ke maamle main vipannataa kaa shikaar he
 People say that there is also happiness from the envy of the neighbor
 118wein nabar par bharat agar peeche mudakar dekhegaa to 119wein par myanmar he
 Democracy is still coming here in them
 hamaare yahaan to kab se he
 You must have heard the Ministry of Happiness
 duniya main kai log saudi arab ke naam se rote hai magar heppiness index main 34wein number par maujuud saudi arab ne is saal farvari main ek prasannataa mantralay banaaya he
 February to April has come and now it has been copied in India
 nakal karne vaale ko dhanyavad
 Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan announced that his state will also have a happy ministry which will evaluate the development of the state whether people are happy or not
 lekin desh ke kisi bhi hasya kavi ne ise gambhirtha se nahin liya, main samaj saktaa hum kyonki siem chouhan ne isaki ghoshnaa ek april ko kii thi
 When you can become a ministry on happiness, why can't you see happiness prime time
 vaise prasannataa mantralay main hota kya hoga
 People will keep on laughing
 dusron kii haalat par or apni haalat par bhi
 i am asking
 to shuru karte hai
 We can tell from now that our intention is to make everyone's heart hurt
 kyonki jinka dukhega matlab unako duniya main koi nahin hansaa saktaa he
 They would not have got permission to decorate the airport, so these people came with the band
 aane vaale ke swaagat main
 Who was going to come at Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Airport, which has led so many people
 car ko is tarah se sajaa kar laae hai
 Let's gess kiske intazaar main khub sara tirangaa jhanda laharaaya ja rahaa he
 Secondly, wait for whom these people are standing with posters of Bharat Mata Ki Jai
 teesraa ges kiijie kiske liye ye log nayaa nayaa tii shart pahanakar aae hai
 Look at this t-shirt properly
 isamen aane vaale kaa photo bhi bana he
 This is not aadhaar-t-shirt but photo shows that Gujarat IPS officer DG Vanzara is coming to Ahmedabad
 kai farzi encounter main vanjaaraa sahab jail main band the
 He was sent to Mumbai jail a few years ago
 kuch din pehle zamanaat par baahar aae or jab mumbai se gujarat jane kii ijazat mili to apni entry ko grand bana diya
 Vanjara saheb has said that he is welcome to all patriots
 saare deshbhakt thik se dekh len ki unka swaagat hua he
 Even if you have not got a chance to go to jail on charges of encounter like Vanzara, you can accept this welcome
 sochiye jab ye bari honge to kaisaa swaagat hoga
 Not only this, while living in jail, Vanzara must have missed his service revolver too
 shaayad isiilie jab ahmedabad airport se baahar nikle to ek kaarykram main pahunche or manch par talwaar dance kaa namoona pesh kiya
 Danced with a sword as if someone had won the war
 bharat shanti kaa pujari rahaa he lekin aisa nahin he ki log talwaar chalaanaa bhul gaye hai
 When the bridegroom can go to the wedding with a sword, how can you stop someone from dancing the sword when you come from jail
 is tasviir par aap hans hi sakate hai kyonki rone se koi phayda nahin
 This can happen in India at all
 vaise banjaaraa sahab jis tarah se talwaar bhanj rahe hai lagata he ki itane saal jail main rahane ke baad bhi ve apni puraani aadaten nahin bhuule hai
 Now we do not know whether in Indian jails, inmates are trained to stab swords or not
 hats aaf tu him and you tu coffee vid karan sho to aapane dekha hi hoga
 You must have heard about the discussion on tea
 coffee vid captain suna tha kya
 Talk to tea has now reached coffee
 abhi modi ji assam se aa jaaenge to kahenge ki congress amiron kii party he
 Drinks coffee
 coffee pilaati he
 Where did the money come from mitron ham kaaphi nahin pilaa sakate hai
 Donate to us ham garib log hai tabhi to main chaay bechata tha
 Then the quarrel will arrive at the cost of the suit and on Mallya's ship
 isse pehle ham kaaphi vid captain pi le lete hai
 However, what people in Punjab like to drink has been banned in Bihar
 lekin punjab main captain hote hai
 He was also the captain of hockey before
 cricket ke captain hue magar coffee vid captain koi nahin hua
 Amarinder Singh is the leader of the Congress
 mujhe lagata he ki ve pradhanmantri modi kii style churaane ko lekar kaaphi pareshaan the lekin chaay bechney par modi ji kaa aisa copirite he ki kisi netaa ke liye dupliket bananaa bahut mushkil he
 As a result, this idea has come with Coffee with Captain
 pradhanmantri modi ne haal hi main kaha tha ki ve assam kii chaay bechate the
 Tea was discussed for two years but neither the PM told nor the people asked him what tea you used to sell
 khud hi piem ne bataa diya ki ve assam kii chaay bechate the
 They are the only teas that still remember what place they used to sell tea twenty-five or thirty years ago
 yaad nahin hota to ve darjeeling tii kaa bhi naam le sakate the magar nahin liya
 You know that there is no coffee in Punjab
 chaay koun si gujarat main hoti he
 Coffee is grown in Karnataka
 karnataka ke congressi mukhyamantri pareshaan hi honge ki coffee ugaate wo hai or pilaa captain sahab rahe hai
 We have heard that no coffee drinker is being found in Punjab
 jab tak nahin miltaa kya aisa ho saktaa he ki captain sahab coffee vid karan ke set par chale jaaen
 Karan Johar will be a little upset but he can leave the set by swearing at Punjab
 phir unke saamne shilpa se lekar karina jo bhi ho unke saath kaaphi par charchaa kar len
 If Coffee With Captain hits, what will happen to Coffee with Karan
 ye sochane kaa time nahin he
 Time to drink yah bhi ho saktaa he ki coffee vid karan bhi congress gaanv gaanv main dikhaa sakati he
 What has been the popular show, do you know that dark clouds should be removed from it
 saath saal tak raaj karne kaa yah phayda hota he
 Then the Congress is drinking a lot
 thode din ruk jaaiye bijepi bhi pilaaegi
 However, BJP has appointed KP Maurya as the President of UP
 maurya sahab apane biodeta main likhte hai ki ve bachapan main chaay bechate the
 He also has ten criminal prosecutions
 vaise aap chaay par hi dhyaan den
 Anything can happen in BJP by selling tea
 pataa nahin congress main coffee bechney se kya hoga
 The news has come that Rashtriya Lok Dal is going to merge with Janata Dal United
 rashtriya lokdal ke netaa ajit singh bahut jamaane ke baad apni party ke saath vilay kar rahe hai
 Till now they used to combine and would become ministers in any government
 meraa apana anumaan he ki akele vilay karte karte bor ho gaye honge to is baar apni party kaa hi vilay karne kaa plan bana liya he
 Ajit Singh has very little luck
 unke paas mantrimandal or tasveeron kaa portpholio shandaar he
 In this photo, he is putting his hand on the back of Akhilesh Yadav
 is photo main ve amar singh ke saath hai
 In this photo he is with Rahul Gandhi
 is photo main ve prakaash karaat ke saath hai
 In this photo he is with Rajnath Singh
 is photo main baba ramdev ke saath hai
 In this photo he is with Mayawati
 is photo main ve nitish kumaar ke saath hai
 They are no longer alone
 unki party bhi ab nitish ke saath he
 If such leaders start merging their party then the loneliness of the national parties will increase
 sochiye bijepi or congress gathbandhan ke liye kiske paas jaaengi
 Whatever you want to see Ajit Singh's political album, then take the time and visit him
 1998 main unhone rashtriya lok dal banaaya tha
 After 18 years of running the party, after being with many parties and leaders, Ajit Singh is now entrusting the responsibility of running his party to Nitish Kumar
 rashtriya ke saath saath antarrashtriya khabaren bhi
 Due to the discussion of Bharat Mata ki Jai in India, the expectations of people internationally have increased
 yahaan kai logon ne kaha he ki bharat main rahanaa he to bharat mata kii jai bolnaa hoga
 Hearing this, there is a stir in Europe
 vahaan log apni bas or naav mode kar bharat kii taraf chal padane kii baat karne lage hai
 The refugees of Europe have since heard that to stay in India, they have to be very excited
 siria, pakistan, afghanistan, iraq, kosovo, albenia, nigeria, iraan or ukraine se lakhon log europe main sharnaarthi banane ke liye aavedan de rahe hai
 Most of these people want to live in Germany
 saadhe chaar lakh se adhik logon ne germany main rahane kaa aplication diya he
 If they come to know that someone from India is offering that only by saying Bharat Mata ki Jai can get an opportunity to stay in India, then refugees can turn their boats towards India
 bharat bhi duutavaason main visa counter kii jagah bharat mata kii jai counter khol saktaa he
 Any refugee who comes to this counter and utters Bharat Mata ki Jai can be given a visa to visit India
 duniya bhar main visa dene kaa yah sabase aasaan niyam hoga
 Parinde is upset
 assam kii chunavi raily main bijepi adhyaksh ne kah diya ki hamaari sarkaar ai to bangladesh se parinda bhi par nahin maar paaegaa
 Ajmal understands the problem, but what is the problem with the birds
 paridon ko laga ki kahin parinda mukt bharat kii baat to nahin ho rahi he
 Upon hearing the flyover of the Defense Colony, Parinde bowed his head silent
 chintan manan karne lage ki insaanon ke siyaasi jhagade main ve kahaan se funs gaye
 Nobody was thinking of any way
 to inhen main ek udan ratna puraskaar se sammanit chuun chuun parinde ne hal nikaala
 Parinde said that this is an attack on our right to fly
 parinde par nahin maarenge to kya karenge
 Who is this sky for? ye zamin kiske liye hai
 We are no country of birds
 hamaara to akaash hota he
 If we want to go to Pakistan, go to Bangladesh and come back to India in the evening
 pareshaan parinde kabhi udate rahe, kabhi lautate rahe
 It was decided that Parinda will return his Udyan Ratna Award in protest against this statement of Amit Shah
 media ke saamne parindon ne ud ud kar apana virodh bhi jataayaa he
 Humans are told not to tie the boundaries of the borders
 insaanon ko rokna he to roke
 Let us not stop the birds in his name
 ab amit shah ko dar he ki parindon ke is virodh ko aam aadmi party na saport kar de
 Do not divert them on the wrong path by reciting the Kumar Vishwas poem
 parindon or paalatuon ke prati samvedansheel mantri menka gandhi ne apni chuppi nahin todi he
 Meanwhile, there has been confusion over what punishment should be given to those who do not speak Bharat Mata Ki Jai
 desh se baahar bheja jaae, unka sar kaat diya jaae yaa jabada ukhada jaae
 The first two types of punishments have come under discussion, the idea of jaw-breaking has not yet come up
 shuukravaar ke indian express main chhapi he ye khabar
 Brijmohan Aggarwal is a minister of Chhattisgarh
 inhen lagata he ki baba ramdev kaa gardan kaatane vaala idia pasand nahin aayaa
 Aggarwal, following him a bit, said that if someone in front of our workers would raise anti-national slogans, then we have the strength to lift their jaws
 agar hindustan kii dharti par tumne janam liya he
 You are eating food on the land of India and even after you die, if you get two gazes of land, then you will have to say 'bharat Mata ki Jai' on the land of India
 maine jabada todane kii baat to suni thi, ukhaadne kaa copirite agarwal ji kaa lagata he
 We asked a dentist how the jaw is lifted
 to unhone kaha bahut gambhir maamle main hi jabada ukhda jaataa he
 One and a half hour surgery is done
 bijepi ke kaaryakarta itnaa time lagaayenge to har zile main ek lakh namo ap downlod karwaane kaa target miss kar sakate hai
 When they work as a dentist, when will they download? amit shah ne kaha he ki har zile main ek lakh namo ap downlod hona chahie
 What is going to happen by not speaking so much suffering
 isse to acha he ki na bolne vaale jai bol hi den
 How angry those who ask to speak have become
 kuch to naa bolne waalon ko sochna chahie
 Swami Agnivesh has written an article in the Indian Express on Baba Ramdev's statement that his beheading statement is anti-religion
 agnivesh ji ko padhate hue main pro ramdev ho gaya
 If Baba did not love humanity, he would not make pickles, biscuits or flour for human consumption
 unka gussa agnivesh nahin samaj paa rahe hai
 Baba knows that if the millions of heads are cut off, then the noodles eaters will reduce
 phir bhi wo ye gussa bardaasht nahin kar paa rahe hai
 Thankfully, there is a constitution in the country
 unhone kaha ki is desh main kanoon he, nahin to teri ek kii kya, ham to lakhon kii gardan kaat sakate hai
 i am very sure that Baba will not do this
 gusse main kah gaye hai
 Swami will make atonement by reading Agnivesh's article
 lakhon sar kaat kar apane aate or noodles kaa nuksaan koun karegaa
 There is something that Baba did not get so angry even when he did not get black money
 nahin bolne vaale bhi kam nahin hai
 If you do not want to speak, do not speak, it is important to speak in front of Baba or not
 khwamkhah apane sar ko risk zone main kyon daalana chaahate ho bhai
 Several cases of corruption are under investigation against Himachal Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh
 unhone teen baar bharat mata kii jai bol kar congress ko bhi kanphyus kar diya he
 Virbhadra Singh said that i am a true patriot
 dil se rashtravaadi hum
 The BJP is also confused by Virbhadra Singh's Bharat Mata ki Jai
 wo samaj nahin paa rahi he ki aalochana kare yaa swaagat kare
 Virbhadra Singh has said that he will now raise the slogan of Bharat Mata ki Jai at every function
 is bich kohinoor heere ko lekar rashtrawaad sankat main aa gaya he
 The people of India and the news agencies have been claiming Kohinoor, but a Supreme Court comment may put the Kohinoor side of Indian nationalism in jeopardy
 supreme court main kohinoor ko bharat laane kii maang ko lekar yachika daayar kii gai he
 Subramanian Swamy and Prashant Bhushan, famous for the petitions, have not filed this petition
 ol india human ritis and soshal justise front ne daayar kii he
 The petitioner has also spoken of making the British High Commissioner a party
 supreme court ne kaha he ki dakshin africa, pakistan or bangladesh samet kai desh kohinoor par apana haq jataa chuke hai
 It has done what the government had to do
 phir bhi solicitre general se raay maangi gai he
 Why are you asking for a diamond that is claimed by many countries? na bolne ke liye mashhoor purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne bolne ke liye mashhoor maujuuda pradhanmantri narendra modi ko salaah di he
 It is said that there is more importance than speaking
 modi ji ko ye salaah dene ke liye manmohan singh ne bolaa he ye news he
 Before the 2014 elections, Modi used to tell Manmohan Singh that if he has done anything, then also speak
 bich main kuch muddon par jab modi ji chup hue to congressi netaaon ko manmohan singh kii yaad aane lagi he or ve modi ji ko maun modi kehane lage
 Did not understand that he was criticizing Modi ji or his former Prime Minister
 maun modi kehane se modi ji bhi kanphyus ho gaye honge isile unhone kai muddon par bolaa hi nahin
 Meanwhile, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has said that those whose names have appeared in the Panama Papers will have a sleepless night
 aise logon ko meri salaah he ki subah subah hi indian express pard len jisamen panama papers par rose kuch na kuch chap rahaa he or din main hi so len taaki raaton ko neend na aane par koi pareshaani na ho
 Now let's move to the next news
 hansega india to badhegaa india
 Don't add this slogan of Friday to Start Up India, Stand Up India
 hamaara makasad yahi he ki raajnneetik bahason ko lekar jo katutaa he wo thodi kam ho jaae
 Do not judge everything on the scale of facts
 aap jaanate hai ki do log bhaag gaye hai
 One has fled abroad and is in a country, but it is not known
 modi sarkaar ke ek mantri vaai es choudhary ko aapane kisi bas stand par dekha ho to turant telugana police ko ittela kar den
 The court sent three summons to Chaudhary Saheb but he could not appear
 ve kendriya mantrimandal main vigyaan evam technalji rajya mantri hai
 My own humor is that they might be hidden in a science lab
 marishas ke ek bank ne inke khilaaf shikaayat kii he ki choudhary ji uskaa lone nahin chukaa rahe hai
 Same to Sem Indian banks have complained that Mallya saheb is not paying their loan
 kahin aisa to nahin ki ye donon exange program ke tahat gaayab ho gaye hai
 a non-bailable warrant has been issued against Chaudhary
 inhen mantrimandal se shaayad isliye bhi nahin hataaya gaya he ki kya pataa mantripad ke laalach main ye bhaag hi na paaen
 The minister has told the court that he has some important work in Delhi, so the courts are unable to come
 mujhe mantri ji kii baat par puraa bharosa he kyonki unhone nyaaypalika ke sammaan kii baat kahi he
 So trust because YS Chaudhary owes only 106 crores to the bank of another country
 maalya sahab to 9000 karod lekar bhaage hai, sochiye bainkon kaa dil kitna dhadkta hoga
 In this panic, banks have turned down Mallya's proposal
 maalya ne kaha tha ki ve sitambar tak 4000 karod rupaya de sakate hai
 Banks said they will take all the money
 sochiye morishas kaa bank hyderabad tak pahunch kar lone difolter ke khilaaf warrant jari karvaa le rahaa he, hamaare bank yaheen se maalya ji se ummid kar rahe hai ki ve videsh main rahete hue bharat kaa paisa bharat bhijwa den
 It has become easier for IIT students to pay expensive fees
 dhyaan se sunen
 The fees of general students have been increased from 90,000 to two lakhs
 lekin chaatro ko do lakh dene main dikkat na aae isliye iaiti ke chaatro ko bina byaaj ke karj milegaa
 In the coming time, students of other institutions can also demand this wonderful facility
 jo paisa byaaj kaa lagegaa use fees main jodakar byaaj maaf kar diya jaae to unhen pataa bhi nahin chalegaa ki fees badi he
 The Ministry of Human Resources should congratulate that it has rejected the proposal to increase the fees threefold
 sirf do guna fees badhaai gai he
 Fees for the remaining students have also been waived
 hansega india badhegaa india sho local nahin he
 It also has international news
 britain kii sarkaar ke ek bade salaahkaar ne kaha he ki motopa mote aadmi kii samasya nahin he
 This problem is not due to the fat man who has become obese by eating too much
 telegraph akhbaar main khabar chhapi he ki isamen mote logon kii koi galati nahin he ki ve kam nahin kha pate hai
 The culprit for this is the same environment that Odd Even is relaunching in Delhi to fight
 thik he ki koi zyaada khaane par control nahin kar paata he lekin motopa ichhashakti ke rashtriya patan ke kaaran nahin hota he
 This also happens because the environment has changed
 is research ke baad mote log jam kar kha sakate hai ki ve apni vajah se nahin, paryaavaran ke kaarnon se mote ho rahe hai
 The comments bharat kab se pakistan ko sabak sikhaana chahta he lekin cricket match se aage baat nahin bad paati he
 But North Korea does not just talk like India
 wo kaalpanik video banaakar khush hota rahata he ki yahaan bam giraaya to vahaan dekho vahaan bam giraaya
 The title of this video is if the ultimatum is not answered

 In this way, he is selling the dream of attack in these countries in his country

 aap jaanate hai ki shuukravaar ko ek film reelij hui he jangal book
 Many of us have seen the serial form of this film on Doordarshan without any parental guidance
 nabbe ke dashak main
 But the highly sensitive Censor Board of India has given the film a u / a certificate
 yani baarah saal se kam ke bacchon ko ise dekhne ke liye maa baap ke saath janaa hoga
 Pahlaj Nihalani, chairman of the censor board, says that the film has a 3D effect
 sound effect chote bacchon ke liye daraavna ho saktaa he
 Anyway, where would the parents let such young children go alone to the cinema hall
 magar is faisle kaa mazaaq ud rahaa he
 Those on Twitter who are older than twelve years are not serious on this decision
 kaaphi hans rahe hai
 You recognize this headquarters where there is a speech every day, but if it is in Hindi, then it becomes very big
 sanyukt raashtra duniya bhar main khushhaali par ek report nikaalata he jinamein un deshon main bhi khushi khoji jaati he jo kuposhan ke shikaar hai
 Since 2012, the United Nations has considered removing the Happiness Index
 apane bharat kaa sthaan 118waan he
 We are ranked 118 among 157 countries
 ham itane kam khush kyon hai
 Do we Indians laugh after 117 countries
 wet karte hai ki pehle denmark hans le phir sweetzaraland hans le tab jaakar hansenge
 It is absolutely wrong

 Pakistan also laughs before us when we see this list
 wo 92wein number par he
 China laughs before both Pakistan and India, which means number 83
 main to bardaasht nahin kar paa rahaa ki apana bharat jahaan bharat mata ko lekar itani jang ho rahi he wo prasannataa ke maamle main vipannataa kaa shikaar he
 People say that there is also happiness from the envy of the neighbor
 118wein nabar par bharat agar peeche mudakar dekhegaa to 119wein par myanmar he
 Democracy is still coming here in them
 hamaare yahaan to kab se he

 Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan announced that his state will also have a happy ministry which will evaluate the development of the state whether people are happy or not
 lekin desh ke kisi bhi hasya kavi ne ise gambhirtha se nahin liya, main samaj saktaa hum kyonki siem chouhan ne isaki ghoshnaa ek april ko kii thi
 When you can become a ministry on happiness, why can't you see happiness prime time

 People will keep on laughing
 dusron kii haalat par or apni haalat par bhi

 This is not aadhaar-t-shirt but photo shows that Gujarat IPS officer DG Vanzara is coming to Ahmedabad
 kai farzi encounter main vanjaaraa sahab jail main band the
 He was sent to Mumbai jail a few years ago
 kuch din pehle zamanaat par baahar aae or jab mumbai se gujarat jane kii ijazat mili to apni entry ko grand bana diya
 Vanjara saheb has said that he is welcome to all patriots
 saare deshbhakt thik se dekh len ki unka swaagat hua he
 Even if you have not got a chance to go to jail on charges of encounter like Vanzara, you can accept this welcome
 sochiye jab ye bari honge to kaisaa swaagat hoga
 Not only this, while living in jail, Vanzara must have missed his service revolver too

 Danced with a sword as if someone had won the war

 When the bridegroom can go to the wedding with a sword, how can you stop someone from dancing the sword when you come from jail
 is tasviir par aap hans hi sakate hai kyonki rone se koi phayda nahin
 This can happen in India at all
 vaise banjaaraa sahab jis tarah se talwaar bhanj rahe hai lagata he ki itane saal jail main rahane ke baad bhi ve apni puraani aadaten nahin bhuule hai
 Now we do not know whether in Indian jails, inmates are trained to stab swords or not

 You must have heard about the discussion on tea
 coffee vid captain suna tha kya
 Talk to tea has now reached coffee
 abhi modi ji assam se aa jaaenge to kahenge ki congress amiron kii party he
 Drinks coffee
 coffee pilaati he
 Where did the money come from mitron ham kaaphi nahin pilaa sakate hai
 Donate to us ham garib log hai tabhi to main chaay bechata tha
 Then the quarrel will arrive at the cost of the suit and on Mallya's ship
 isse pehle ham kaaphi vid captain pi le lete hai
 However, what people in Punjab like to drink has been banned in Bihar
 lekin punjab main captain hote hai
 He was also the captain of hockey before
 cricket ke captain hue magar coffee vid captain koi nahin hua
 Amarinder Singh is the leader of the Congress
 mujhe lagata he ki ve pradhanmantri modi kii style churaane ko lekar kaaphi pareshaan the lekin chaay bechney par modi ji kaa aisa copirite he ki kisi netaa ke liye dupliket bananaa bahut mushkil he
 As a result, this idea has come with Coffee with Captain
 pradhanmantri modi ne haal hi main kaha tha ki ve assam kii chaay bechate the
 Tea was discussed for two years but neither the PM told nor the people asked him what tea you used to sell
 khud hi piem ne bataa diya ki ve assam kii chaay bechate the
 They are the only teas that still remember what place they used to sell tea twenty-five or thirty years ago
 yaad nahin hota to ve darjeeling tii kaa bhi naam le sakate the magar nahin liya
 You know that there is no coffee in Punjab
 chaay koun si gujarat main hoti he
 Coffee is grown in Karnataka
 karnataka ke congressi mukhyamantri pareshaan hi honge ki coffee ugaate wo hai or pilaa captain sahab rahe hai
 We have heard that no coffee drinker is being found in Punjab
 jab tak nahin miltaa kya aisa ho saktaa he ki captain sahab coffee vid karan ke set par chale jaaen
 Karan Johar will be a little upset but he can leave the set by swearing at Punjab
 phir unke saamne shilpa se lekar karina jo bhi ho unke saath kaaphi par charchaa kar len
 If Coffee With Captain hits, what will happen to Coffee with Karan
 ye sochane kaa time nahin he
 Time to drink yah bhi ho saktaa he ki coffee vid karan bhi congress gaanv gaanv main dikhaa sakati he
 What has been the popular show, do you know that dark clouds should be removed from it
 saath saal tak raaj karne kaa yah phayda hota he
 Then the Congress is drinking a lot
 thode din ruk jaaiye bijepi bhi pilaaegi
 However, BJP has appointed KP Maurya as the President of UP
 maurya sahab apane biodeta main likhte hai ki ve bachapan main chaay bechate the
 He also has ten criminal prosecutions
 vaise aap chaay par hi dhyaan den
 Anything can happen in BJP by selling tea
 pataa nahin congress main coffee bechney se kya hoga
 The news has come that Rashtriya Lok Dal is going to merge with Janata Dal United
 rashtriya lokdal ke netaa ajit singh bahut jamaane ke baad apni party ke saath vilay kar rahe hai
 Till now they used to combine and would become ministers in any government
 meraa apana anumaan he ki akele vilay karte karte bor ho gaye honge to is baar apni party kaa hi vilay karne kaa plan bana liya he
 Ajit Singh has very little luck
 unke paas mantrimandal or tasveeron kaa portpholio shandaar he
 In this photo, he is putting his hand on the back of Akhilesh Yadav
 is photo main ve amar singh ke saath hai
 In this photo he is with Rahul Gandhi
 is photo main ve prakaash karaat ke saath hai
 In this photo he is with Rajnath Singh
 is photo main baba ramdev ke saath hai
 In this photo he is with Mayawati
 is photo main ve nitish kumaar ke saath hai
 They are no longer alone
 unki party bhi ab nitish ke saath he
 If such leaders start merging their party then the loneliness of the national parties will increase
 sochiye bijepi or congress gathbandhan ke liye kiske paas jaaengi
 Whatever you want to see Ajit Singh's political album, then take the time and visit him
 1998 main unhone rashtriya lok dal banaaya tha
 After 18 years of running the party, after being with many parties and leaders, Ajit Singh is now entrusting the responsibility of running his party to Nitish Kumar
 rashtriya ke saath saath antarrashtriya khabaren bhi
 Due to the discussion of Bharat Mata ki Jai in India, the expectations of people internationally have increased
 yahaan kai logon ne kaha he ki bharat main rahanaa he to bharat mata kii jai bolnaa hoga
 Hearing this, there is a stir in Europe
 vahaan log apni bas or naav mode kar bharat kii taraf chal padane kii baat karne lage hai
 The refugees of Europe have since heard that to stay in India, they have to be very excited
 siria, pakistan, afghanistan, iraq, kosovo, albenia, nigeria, iraan or ukraine se lakhon log europe main sharnaarthi banane ke liye aavedan de rahe hai
 Most of these people want to live in Germany
 saadhe chaar lakh se adhik logon ne germany main rahane kaa aplication diya he
 If they come to know that someone from India is offering that only by saying Bharat Mata ki Jai can get an opportunity to stay in India, then refugees can turn their boats towards India
 bharat bhi duutavaason main visa counter kii jagah bharat mata kii jai counter khol saktaa he
 Any refugee who comes to this counter and utters Bharat Mata ki Jai can be given a visa to visit India
 duniya bhar main visa dene kaa yah sabase aasaan niyam hoga
 Parinde is upset
 assam kii chunavi raily main bijepi adhyaksh ne kah diya ki hamaari sarkaar ai to bangladesh se parinda bhi par nahin maar paaegaa
 Ajmal understands the problem, but what is the problem with the birds
 paridon ko laga ki kahin parinda mukt bharat kii baat to nahin ho rahi he
 Upon hearing the flyover of the Defense Colony, Parinde bowed his head silent
 chintan manan karne lage ki insaanon ke siyaasi jhagade main ve kahaan se funs gaye
 Nobody was thinking of any way
 to inhen main ek udan ratna puraskaar se sammanit chuun chuun parinde ne hal nikaala
 Parinde said that this is an attack on our right to fly
 parinde par nahin maarenge to kya karenge
 Who is this sky for? ye zamin kiske liye hai
 We are no country of birds
 hamaara to akaash hota he
 If we want to go to Pakistan, go to Bangladesh and come back to India in the evening
 pareshaan parinde kabhi udate rahe, kabhi lautate rahe
 It was decided that Parinda will return his Udyan Ratna Award in protest against this statement of Amit Shah
 media ke saamne parindon ne ud ud kar apana virodh bhi jataayaa he
 Humans are told not to tie the boundaries of the borders
 insaanon ko rokna he to roke
 Let us not stop the birds in his name
 ab amit shah ko dar he ki parindon ke is virodh ko aam aadmi party na saport kar de
 Do not divert them on the wrong path by reciting the Kumar Vishwas poem
 parindon or paalatuon ke prati samvedansheel mantri menka gandhi ne apni chuppi nahin todi he
 Meanwhile, there has been confusion over what punishment should be given to those who do not speak Bharat Mata Ki Jai
 desh se baahar bheja jaae, unka sar kaat diya jaae yaa jabada ukhada jaae
 The first two types of punishments have come under discussion, the idea of jaw-breaking has not yet come up
 shuukravaar ke indian express main chhapi he ye khabar
 Brijmohan Aggarwal is a minister of Chhattisgarh
 inhen lagata he ki baba ramdev kaa gardan kaatane vaala idia pasand nahin aayaa
 Aggarwal, following him a bit, said that if someone in front of our workers would raise anti-national slogans, then we have the strength to lift their jaws
 agar hindustan kii dharti par tumne janam liya he
 You are eating food on the land of India and even after you die, if you get two gazes of land, then you will have to say 'bharat Mata ki Jai' on the land of India
 maine jabada todane kii baat to suni thi, ukhaadne kaa copirite agarwal ji kaa lagata he
 We asked a dentist how the jaw is lifted
 to unhone kaha bahut gambhir maamle main hi jabada ukhda jaataa he
 One and a half hour surgery is done
 bijepi ke kaaryakarta itnaa time lagaayenge to har zile main ek lakh namo ap downlod karwaane kaa target miss kar sakate hai
 When they work as a dentist, when will they download? amit shah ne kaha he ki har zile main ek lakh namo ap downlod hona chahie
 What is going to happen by not speaking so much suffering
 isse to acha he ki na bolne vaale jai bol hi den
 How angry those who ask to speak have become
 kuch to naa bolne waalon ko sochna chahie
 Swami Agnivesh has written an article in the Indian Express on Baba Ramdev's statement that his beheading statement is anti-religion
 agnivesh ji ko padhate hue main pro ramdev ho gaya
 If Baba did not love humanity, he would not make pickles, biscuits or flour for human consumption
 unka gussa agnivesh nahin samaj paa rahe hai
 Baba knows that if the millions of heads are cut off, then the noodles eaters will reduce
 phir bhi wo ye gussa bardaasht nahin kar paa rahe hai
 Thankfully, there is a constitution in the country
 unhone kaha ki is desh main kanoon he, nahin to teri ek kii kya, ham to lakhon kii gardan kaat sakate hai
 i am very sure that Baba will not do this
 gusse main kah gaye hai
 Swami will make atonement by reading Agnivesh's article
 lakhon sar kaat kar apane aate or noodles kaa nuksaan koun karegaa
 There is something that Baba did not get so angry even when he did not get black money
 nahin bolne vaale bhi kam nahin hai
 If you do not want to speak, do not speak, it is important to speak in front of Baba or not
 khwamkhah apane sar ko risk zone main kyon daalana chaahate ho bhai
 Several cases of corruption are under investigation against Himachal Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh
 unhone teen baar bharat mata kii jai bol kar congress ko bhi kanphyus kar diya he
 Virbhadra Singh said that i am a true patriot
 dil se rashtravaadi hum
 The BJP is also confused by Virbhadra Singh's Bharat Mata ki Jai
 wo samaj nahin paa rahi he ki aalochana kare yaa swaagat kare
 Virbhadra Singh has said that he will now raise the slogan of Bharat Mata ki Jai at every function
 is bich kohinoor heere ko lekar rashtrawaad sankat main aa gaya he
 The people of India and the news agencies have been claiming Kohinoor, but a Supreme Court comment may put the Kohinoor side of Indian nationalism in jeopardy
 supreme court main kohinoor ko bharat laane kii maang ko lekar yachika daayar kii gai he
 Subramanian Swamy and Prashant Bhushan, famous for the petitions, have not filed this petition
 ol india human ritis and soshal justise front ne daayar kii he
 The petitioner has also spoken of making the British High Commissioner a party
 supreme court ne kaha he ki dakshin africa, pakistan or bangladesh samet kai desh kohinoor par apana haq jataa chuke hai
 It has done what the government had to do
 phir bhi solicitre general se raay maangi gai he
 Why are you asking for a diamond that is claimed by many countries? na bolne ke liye mashhoor purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne bolne ke liye mashhoor maujuuda pradhanmantri narendra modi ko salaah di he
 It is said that there is more importance than speaking
 modi ji ko ye salaah dene ke liye manmohan singh ne bolaa he ye news he
 Before the 2014 elections, Modi used to tell Manmohan Singh that if he has done anything, then also speak
 bich main kuch muddon par jab modi ji chup hue to congressi netaaon ko manmohan singh kii yaad aane lagi he or ve modi ji ko maun modi kehane lage
 Did not understand that he was criticizing Modi ji or his former Prime Minister
 maun modi kehane se modi ji bhi kanphyus ho gaye honge isile unhone kai muddon par bolaa hi nahin
 Meanwhile, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has said that those whose names have appeared in the Panama Papers will have a sleepless night
 aise logon ko meri salaah he ki subah subah hi indian express pard len jisamen panama papers par rose kuch na kuch chap rahaa he or din main hi so len taaki raaton ko neend na aane par koi pareshaani na ho
 Now let's move to the next news
 hansega india to badhegaa india
 Don't add this slogan of Friday to Start Up India, Stand Up India
 hamaara makasad yahi he ki raajnneetik bahason ko lekar jo katutaa he wo thodi kam ho jaae
 Do not judge everything on the scale of facts
 aap jaanate hai ki do log bhaag gaye hai
 One has fled abroad and is in a country, but it is not known
 modi sarkaar ke ek mantri vaai es choudhary ko aapane kisi bas stand par dekha ho to turant telugana police ko ittela kar den
 The court sent three summons to Chaudhary Saheb but he could not appear
 ve kendriya mantrimandal main vigyaan evam technalji rajya mantri hai
 My own humor is that they might be hidden in a science lab
 marishas ke ek bank ne inke khilaaf shikaayat kii he ki choudhary ji uskaa lone nahin chukaa rahe hai
 Same to Sem Indian banks have complained that Mallya saheb is not paying their loan
 kahin aisa to nahin ki ye donon exange program ke tahat gaayab ho gaye hai
 a non-bailable warrant has been issued against Chaudhary
 inhen mantrimandal se shaayad isliye bhi nahin hataaya gaya he ki kya pataa mantripad ke laalach main ye bhaag hi na paaen
 The minister has told the court that he has some important work in Delhi, so the courts are unable to come
 mujhe mantri ji kii baat par puraa bharosa he kyonki unhone nyaaypalika ke sammaan kii baat kahi he
 So trust because YS Chaudhary owes only 106 crores to the bank of another country
 maalya sahab to 9000 karod lekar bhaage hai, sochiye bainkon kaa dil kitna dhadkta hoga
 In this panic, banks have turned down Mallya's proposal
 maalya ne kaha tha ki ve sitambar tak 4000 karod rupaya de sakate hai
 Banks said they will take all the money
 sochiye morishas kaa bank hyderabad tak pahunch kar lone difolter ke khilaaf warrant jari karvaa le rahaa he, hamaare bank yaheen se maalya ji se ummid kar rahe hai ki ve videsh main rahete hue bharat kaa paisa bharat bhijwa den
 It has become easier for IIT students to pay expensive fees
 dhyaan se sunen
 The fees of general students have been increased from 90,000 to two lakhs
 lekin chaatro ko do lakh dene main dikkat na aae isliye iaiti ke chaatro ko bina byaaj ke karj milegaa
 In the coming time, students of other institutions can also demand this wonderful facility
 jo paisa byaaj kaa lagegaa use fees main jodakar byaaj maaf kar diya jaae to unhen pataa bhi nahin chalegaa ki fees badi he
 The Ministry of Human Resources should congratulate that it has rejected the proposal to increase the fees threefold
 sirf do guna fees badhaai gai he
 Fees for the remaining students have also been waived
 hansega india badhegaa india sho local nahin he
 It also has international news
 britain kii sarkaar ke ek bade salaahkaar ne kaha he ki motopa mote aadmi kii samasya nahin he
 This problem is not due to the fat man who has become obese by eating too much
 telegraph akhbaar main khabar chhapi he ki isamen mote logon kii koi galati nahin he ki ve kam nahin kha pate hai
 The culprit for this is the same environment that Odd Even is relaunching in Delhi to fight
 thik he ki koi zyaada khaane par control nahin kar paata he lekin motopa ichhashakti ke rashtriya patan ke kaaran nahin hota he
 This also happens because the environment has changed
 is research ke baad mote log jam kar kha sakate hai ki ve apni vajah se nahin, paryaavaran ke kaarnon se mote ho rahe hai
 The comments bharat kab se pakistan ko sabak sikhaana chahta he lekin cricket match se aage baat nahin bad paati he
 But North Korea does not just talk like India
 wo kaalpanik video banaakar khush hota rahata he ki yahaan bam giraaya to vahaan dekho vahaan bam giraaya
 The title of this video is if the ultimatum is not answered
 ham north korea ke shukraguzaar hai ki usne iskaa tital maa kasam badla luungaa nahin rakhaa he
 In this video you can see Submarine has fired missile over Washington
 dakshin korea ke raashtrapati ke makaan blue house ko tabah kar detaa he
 In this way, he is selling the dream of attack in these countries in his country
 ham dinon din haasyaaspad hote ja rahe hai
 Just like we talk like a child sleeping on the roof when we go to power here, exactly the same thing North Korea is doing in this video

 The news has come that Rashtriya Lok Dal is going to merge with Janata Dal United
 rashtriya lokdal ke netaa ajit singh bahut jamaane ke baad apni party ke saath vilay kar rahe hai
 Till now they used to combine and would become ministers in any government
 meraa apana anumaan he ki akele vilay karte karte bor ho gaye honge to is baar apni party kaa hi vilay karne kaa plan bana liya he
 Ajit Singh has very little luck
 unke paas mantrimandal or tasveeron kaa portpholio shandaar he
 In this photo, he is putting his hand on the back of Akhilesh Yadav
 is photo main ve amar singh ke saath hai
 In this photo he is with Rahul Gandhi
 is photo main ve prakaash karaat ke saath hai
 In this photo he is with Rajnath Singh
 is photo main baba ramdev ke saath hai
 In this photo he is with Mayawati
 is photo main ve nitish kumaar ke saath hai
 They are no longer alone
 unki party bhi ab nitish ke saath he
 If such leaders start merging their party then the loneliness of the national parties will increase
 sochiye bijepi or congress gathbandhan ke liye kiske paas jaaengi
 Whatever you want to see Ajit Singh's political album, then take the time and visit him
 1998 main unhone rashtriya lok dal banaaya tha
 After 18 years of running the party, after being with many parties and leaders, Ajit Singh is now entrusting the responsibility of running his party to Nitish Kumar
 rashtriya ke saath saath antarrashtriya khabaren bhi
 Due to the discussion of Bharat Mata ki Jai in India, the expectations of people internationally have increased
 yahaan kai logon ne kaha he ki bharat main rahanaa he to bharat mata kii jai bolnaa hoga
 Hearing this, there is a stir in Europe
 vahaan log apni bas or naav mode kar bharat kii taraf chal padane kii baat karne lage hai
 The refugees of Europe have since heard that to stay in India, they have to be very excited
 siria, pakistan, afghanistan, iraq, kosovo, albenia, nigeria, iraan or ukraine se lakhon log europe main sharnaarthi banane ke liye aavedan de rahe hai
 Most of these people want to live in Germany
 saadhe chaar lakh se adhik logon ne germany main rahane kaa aplication diya he
 If they come to know that someone from India is offering that only by saying Bharat Mata ki Jai can get an opportunity to stay in India, then refugees can turn their boats towards India
 bharat bhi duutavaason main visa counter kii jagah bharat mata kii jai counter khol saktaa he
 Any refugee who comes to this counter and utters Bharat Mata ki Jai can be given a visa to visit India
 duniya bhar main visa dene kaa yah sabase aasaan niyam hoga
 Parinde is upset
 assam kii chunavi raily main bijepi adhyaksh ne kah diya ki hamaari sarkaar ai to bangladesh se parinda bhi par nahin maar paaegaa
 Ajmal understands the problem, but what is the problem with the birds
 paridon ko laga ki kahin parinda mukt bharat kii baat to nahin ho rahi he
 Upon hearing the flyover of the Defense Colony, Parinde bowed his head silent
 chintan manan karne lage ki insaanon ke siyaasi jhagade main ve kahaan se funs gaye
 Nobody was thinking of any way
 to inhen main ek udan ratna puraskaar se sammanit chuun chuun parinde ne hal nikaala
 Parinde said that this is an attack on our right to fly
 parinde par nahin maarenge to kya karenge
 Who is this sky for? ye zamin kiske liye hai
 We are no country of birds
 hamaara to akaash hota he
 If we want to go to Pakistan, go to Bangladesh and come back to India in the evening
 pareshaan parinde kabhi udate rahe, kabhi lautate rahe
 It was decided that Parinda will return his Udyan Ratna Award in protest against this statement of Amit Shah
 media ke saamne parindon ne ud ud kar apana virodh bhi jataayaa he
 Humans are told not to tie the boundaries of the borders
 insaanon ko rokna he to roke
 Let us not stop the birds in his name
 ab amit shah ko dar he ki parindon ke is virodh ko aam aadmi party na saport kar de
 Do not divert them on the wrong path by reciting the Kumar Vishwas poem
 parindon or paalatuon ke prati samvedansheel mantri menka gandhi ne apni chuppi nahin todi he
 Meanwhile, there has been confusion over what punishment should be given to those who do not speak Bharat Mata Ki Jai
 desh se baahar bheja jaae, unka sar kaat diya jaae yaa jabada ukhada jaae
 The first two types of punishments have come under discussion, the idea of jaw-breaking has not yet come up
 shuukravaar ke indian express main chhapi he ye khabar
 Brijmohan Aggarwal is a minister of Chhattisgarh
 inhen lagata he ki baba ramdev kaa gardan kaatane vaala idia pasand nahin aayaa
 Aggarwal, following him a bit, said that if someone in front of our workers would raise anti-national slogans, then we have the strength to lift their jaws
 agar hindustan kii dharti par tumne janam liya he
 You are eating food on the land of India and even after you die, if you get two gazes of land, then you will have to say 'bharat Mata ki Jai' on the land of India
 maine jabada todane kii baat to suni thi, ukhaadne kaa copirite agarwal ji kaa lagata he
 We asked a dentist how the jaw is lifted
 to unhone kaha bahut gambhir maamle main hi jabada ukhda jaataa he
 One and a half hour surgery is done
 bijepi ke kaaryakarta itnaa time lagaayenge to har zile main ek lakh namo ap downlod karwaane kaa target miss kar sakate hai
 When they work as a dentist, when will they download? amit shah ne kaha he ki har zile main ek lakh namo ap downlod hona chahie
 What is going to happen by not speaking so much suffering
 isse to acha he ki na bolne vaale jai bol hi den
 How angry those who ask to speak have become
 kuch to naa bolne waalon ko sochna chahie
 Swami Agnivesh has written an article in the Indian Express on Baba Ramdev's statement that his beheading statement is anti-religion
 agnivesh ji ko padhate hue main pro ramdev ho gaya
 If Baba did not love humanity, he would not make pickles, biscuits or flour for human consumption
 unka gussa agnivesh nahin samaj paa rahe hai
 Baba knows that if the millions of heads are cut off, then the noodles eaters will reduce
 phir bhi wo ye gussa bardaasht nahin kar paa rahe hai
 Thankfully, there is a constitution in the country
 unhone kaha ki is desh main kanoon he, nahin to teri ek kii kya, ham to lakhon kii gardan kaat sakate hai
 i am very sure that Baba will not do this
 gusse main kah gaye hai
 Swami will make atonement by reading Agnivesh's article
 lakhon sar kaat kar apane aate or noodles kaa nuksaan koun karegaa
 There is something that Baba did not get so angry even when he did not get black money
 nahin bolne vaale bhi kam nahin hai
 If you do not want to speak, do not speak, it is important to speak in front of Baba or not
 khwamkhah apane sar ko risk zone main kyon daalana chaahate ho bhai
 Several cases of corruption are under investigation against Himachal Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh
 unhone teen baar bharat mata kii jai bol kar congress ko bhi kanphyus kar diya he
 Virbhadra Singh said that i am a true patriot
 dil se rashtravaadi hum
 The BJP is also confused by Virbhadra Singh's Bharat Mata ki Jai
 wo samaj nahin paa rahi he ki aalochana kare yaa swaagat kare
 Virbhadra Singh has said that he will now raise the slogan of Bharat Mata ki Jai at every function
 is bich kohinoor heere ko lekar rashtrawaad sankat main aa gaya he
 The people of India and the news agencies have been claiming Kohinoor, but a Supreme Court comment may put the Kohinoor side of Indian nationalism in jeopardy
 supreme court main kohinoor ko bharat laane kii maang ko lekar yachika daayar kii gai he
 Subramanian Swamy and Prashant Bhushan, famous for the petitions, have not filed this petition
 ol india human ritis and soshal justise front ne daayar kii he
 The petitioner has also spoken of making the British High Commissioner a party
 supreme court ne kaha he ki dakshin africa, pakistan or bangladesh samet kai desh kohinoor par apana haq jataa chuke hai
 It has done what the government had to do
 phir bhi solicitre general se raay maangi gai he
 Why are you asking for a diamond that is claimed by many countries? na bolne ke liye mashhoor purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne bolne ke liye mashhoor maujuuda pradhanmantri narendra modi ko salaah di he
 It is said that there is more importance than speaking
 modi ji ko ye salaah dene ke liye manmohan singh ne bolaa he ye news he
 Before the 2014 elections, Modi used to tell Manmohan Singh that if he has done anything, then also speak
 bich main kuch muddon par jab modi ji chup hue to congressi netaaon ko manmohan singh kii yaad aane lagi he or ve modi ji ko maun modi kehane lage
 Did not understand that he was criticizing Modi ji or his former Prime Minister
 maun modi kehane se modi ji bhi kanphyus ho gaye honge isile unhone kai muddon par bolaa hi nahin
 Meanwhile, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has said that those whose names have appeared in the Panama Papers will have a sleepless night
 aise logon ko meri salaah he ki subah subah hi indian express pard len jisamen panama papers par rose kuch na kuch chap rahaa he or din main hi so len taaki raaton ko neend na aane par koi pareshaani na ho
 Now let's move to the next news
 hansega india to badhegaa india
 Don't add this slogan of Friday to Start Up India, Stand Up India
 hamaara makasad yahi he ki raajnneetik bahason ko lekar jo katutaa he wo thodi kam ho jaae
 Do not judge everything on the scale of facts
 aap jaanate hai ki do log bhaag gaye hai
 One has fled abroad and is in a country, but it is not known
 modi sarkaar ke ek mantri vaai es choudhary ko aapane kisi bas stand par dekha ho to turant telugana police ko ittela kar den
 The court sent three summons to Chaudhary Saheb but he could not appear
 ve kendriya mantrimandal main vigyaan evam technalji rajya mantri hai
 My own humor is that they might be hidden in a science lab
 marishas ke ek bank ne inke khilaaf shikaayat kii he ki choudhary ji uskaa lone nahin chukaa rahe hai
 Same to Sem Indian banks have complained that Mallya saheb is not paying their loan
 kahin aisa to nahin ki ye donon exange program ke tahat gaayab ho gaye hai
 a non-bailable warrant has been issued against Chaudhary
 inhen mantrimandal se shaayad isliye bhi nahin hataaya gaya he ki kya pataa mantripad ke laalach main ye bhaag hi na paaen
 The minister has told the court that he has some important work in Delhi, so the courts are unable to come
 mujhe mantri ji kii baat par puraa bharosa he kyonki unhone nyaaypalika ke sammaan kii baat kahi he
 So trust because YS Chaudhary owes only 106 crores to the bank of another country
 maalya sahab to 9000 karod lekar bhaage hai, sochiye bainkon kaa dil kitna dhadkta hoga
 In this panic, banks have turned down Mallya's proposal
 maalya ne kaha tha ki ve sitambar tak 4000 karod rupaya de sakate hai
 Banks said they will take all the money
 sochiye morishas kaa bank hyderabad tak pahunch kar lone difolter ke khilaaf warrant jari karvaa le rahaa he, hamaare bank yaheen se maalya ji se ummid kar rahe hai ki ve videsh main rahete hue bharat kaa paisa bharat bhijwa den
 It has become easier for IIT students to pay expensive fees
 dhyaan se sunen
 The fees of general students have been increased from 90,000 to two lakhs
 lekin chaatro ko do lakh dene main dikkat na aae isliye iaiti ke chaatro ko bina byaaj ke karj milegaa
 In the coming time, students of other institutions can also demand this wonderful facility
 jo paisa byaaj kaa lagegaa use fees main jodakar byaaj maaf kar diya jaae to unhen pataa bhi nahin chalegaa ki fees badi he
 The Ministry of Human Resources should congratulate that it has rejected the proposal to increase the fees threefold
 sirf do guna fees badhaai gai he
 Fees for the remaining students have also been waived
 hansega india badhegaa india sho local nahin he
 It also has international news
 britain kii sarkaar ke ek bade salaahkaar ne kaha he ki motopa mote aadmi kii samasya nahin he
 This problem is not due to the fat man who has become obese by eating too much
 telegraph akhbaar main khabar chhapi he ki isamen mote logon kii koi galati nahin he ki ve kam nahin kha pate hai
 The culprit for this is the same environment that Odd Even is relaunching in Delhi to fight
 thik he ki koi zyaada khaane par control nahin kar paata he lekin motopa ichhashakti ke rashtriya patan ke kaaran nahin hota he
 This also happens because the environment has changed
 is research ke baad mote log jam kar kha sakate hai ki ve apni vajah se nahin, paryaavaran ke kaarnon se mote ho rahe hai
 The comments bharat kab se pakistan ko sabak sikhaana chahta he lekin cricket match se aage baat nahin bad paati he
 But North Korea does not just talk like India
 wo kaalpanik video banaakar khush hota rahata he ki yahaan bam giraaya to vahaan dekho vahaan bam giraaya
 The title of this video is if the ultimatum is not answered
 ham north korea ke shukraguzaar hai ki usne iskaa tital maa kasam badla luungaa nahin rakhaa he
 In this video you can see Submarine has fired missile over Washington
 dakshin korea ke raashtrapati ke makaan blue house ko tabah kar detaa he
 In this way, he is selling the dream of attack in these countries in his country
 ham dinon din haasyaaspad hote ja rahe hai
 Just like we talk like a child sleeping on the roof when we go to power here, exactly the same thing North Korea is doing in this video
 ise maaraa aise maaraa sabko maaraa
 Singing to become a world winner video se rashtriya str par bhadaas nikaalane kaa aisa kaarykram aapane puri duniya main na dekha hoga
 The children of the city may not have seen the jungle but it is not that they cannot see the jungle book
 abhi to smart city nahin bana he isliye kam badanaami ho rahi he
 Think what would have happened in this era of smart city
 aap jaanate hai ki shuukravaar ko ek film reelij hui he jangal book
 Many of us have seen the serial form of this film on Doordarshan without any parental guidance
 nabbe ke dashak main
 But the highly sensitive Censor Board of India has given the film a u / a certificate
 yani baarah saal se kam ke bacchon ko ise dekhne ke liye maa baap ke saath janaa hoga
 Pahlaj Nihalani, chairman of the censor board, says that the film has a 3D effect
 sound effect chote bacchon ke liye daraavna ho saktaa he
 Anyway, where would the parents let such young children go alone to the cinema hall
 magar is faisle kaa mazaaq ud rahaa he
 Those on Twitter who are older than twelve years are not serious on this decision
 kaaphi hans rahe hai
 They would not have got permission to decorate the airport, so these people came with the band
 aane vaale ke swaagat main
 Who was going to come at Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Airport, which has led so many people
 car ko is tarah se sajaa kar laae hai
 Let's gess kiske intazaar main khub sara tirangaa jhanda laharaaya ja rahaa he
 Secondly, wait for whom these people are standing with posters of Bharat Mata Ki Jai
 teesraa ges kiijie kiske liye ye log nayaa nayaa tii shart pahanakar aae hai
 Look at this t-shirt properly
 isamen aane vaale kaa photo bhi bana he
 This is not aadhaar-t-shirt but photo shows that Gujarat IPS officer DG Vanzara is coming to Ahmedabad
 kai farzi encounter main vanjaaraa sahab jail main band the
 He was sent to Mumbai jail a few years ago
 kuch din pehle zamanaat par baahar aae or jab mumbai se gujarat jane kii ijazat mili to apni entry ko grand bana diya
 Vanjara saheb has said that he is welcome to all patriots
 saare deshbhakt thik se dekh len ki unka swaagat hua he
 Even if you have not got a chance to go to jail on charges of encounter like Vanzara, you can accept this welcome
 sochiye jab ye bari honge to kaisaa swaagat hoga
 Not only this, while living in jail, Vanzara must have missed his service revolver too
 shaayad isiilie jab ahmedabad airport se baahar nikle to ek kaarykram main pahunche or manch par talwaar dance kaa namoona pesh kiya
 Danced with a sword as if someone had won the war
 bharat shanti kaa pujari rahaa he lekin aisa nahin he ki log talwaar chalaanaa bhul gaye hai
 When the bridegroom can go to the wedding with a sword, how can you stop someone from dancing the sword when you come from jail
 is tasviir par aap hans hi sakate hai kyonki rone se koi phayda nahin
 This can happen in India at all
 vaise banjaaraa sahab jis tarah se talwaar bhanj rahe hai lagata he ki itane saal jail main rahane ke baad bhi ve apni puraani aadaten nahin bhuule hai
 Now we do not know whether in Indian jails, inmates are trained to stab swords or not
 hats aaf tu him and you tu coffee vid karan sho to aapane dekha hi hoga
 You must have heard about the discussion on tea
 coffee vid captain suna tha kya
 Talk to tea has now reached coffee
 abhi modi ji assam se aa jaaenge to kahenge ki congress amiron kii party he
 Drinks coffee
 coffee pilaati he
 Where did the money come from mitron ham kaaphi nahin pilaa sakate hai
 Donate to us ham garib log hai tabhi to main chaay bechata tha
 Then the quarrel will arrive at the cost of the suit and on Mallya's ship
 isse pehle ham kaaphi vid captain pi le lete hai
 However, what people in Punjab like to drink has been banned in Bihar
 lekin punjab main captain hote hai
 He was also the captain of hockey before
 cricket ke captain hue magar coffee vid captain koi nahin hua
 Amarinder Singh is the leader of the Congress
 mujhe lagata he ki ve pradhanmantri modi kii style churaane ko lekar kaaphi pareshaan the lekin chaay bechney par modi ji kaa aisa copirite he ki kisi netaa ke liye dupliket bananaa bahut mushkil he
 As a result, this idea has come with Coffee with Captain
 pradhanmantri modi ne haal hi main kaha tha ki ve assam kii chaay bechate the
 Tea was discussed for two years but neither the PM told nor the people asked him what tea you used to sell
 khud hi piem ne bataa diya ki ve assam kii chaay bechate the
 They are the only teas that still remember what place they used to sell tea twenty-five or thirty years ago
 yaad nahin hota to ve darjeeling tii kaa bhi naam le sakate the magar nahin liya
 You know that there is no coffee in Punjab
 chaay koun si gujarat main hoti he
 Coffee is grown in Karnataka
 karnataka ke congressi mukhyamantri pareshaan hi honge ki coffee ugaate wo hai or pilaa captain sahab rahe hai
 We have heard that no coffee drinker is being found in Punjab
 jab tak nahin miltaa kya aisa ho saktaa he ki captain sahab coffee vid karan ke set par chale jaaen
 Karan Johar will be a little upset but he can leave the set by swearing at Punjab
 phir unke saamne shilpa se lekar karina jo bhi ho unke saath kaaphi par charchaa kar len
 If Coffee With Captain hits, what will happen to Coffee with Karan
 ye sochane kaa time nahin he
 Time to drink yah bhi ho saktaa he ki coffee vid karan bhi congress gaanv gaanv main dikhaa sakati he
 What has been the popular show, do you know that dark clouds should be removed from it
 saath saal tak raaj karne kaa yah phayda hota he
 Then the Congress is drinking a lot
 thode din ruk jaaiye bijepi bhi pilaaegi
 However, BJP has appointed KP Maurya as the President of UP
 maurya sahab apane biodeta main likhte hai ki ve bachapan main chaay bechate the
 He also has ten criminal prosecutions
 vaise aap chaay par hi dhyaan den
 Anything can happen in BJP by selling tea
 pataa nahin congress main coffee bechney se kya hoga
 The news has come that Rashtriya Lok Dal is going to merge with Janata Dal United

 marishas ke ek bank ne inke khilaaf shikaayat kii he ki choudhary ji uskaa lone nahin chukaa rahe hai
 Same to Sem Indian banks have complained that Mallya saheb is not paying their loan
 kahin aisa to nahin ki ye donon exange program ke tahat gaayab ho gaye hai
 a non-bailable warrant has been issued against Chaudhary
 inhen mantrimandal se shaayad isliye bhi nahin hataaya gaya he ki kya pataa mantripad ke laalach main ye bhaag hi na paaen
 The minister has told the court that he has some important work in Delhi, so the courts are unable to come
 mujhe mantri ji kii baat par puraa bharosa he kyonki unhone nyaaypalika ke sammaan kii baat kahi he
 So trust because YS Chaudhary owes only 106 crores to the bank of another country
 maalya sahab to 9000 karod lekar bhaage hai, sochiye bainkon kaa dil kitna dhadkta hoga
 In this panic, banks have turned down Mallya's proposal
 maalya ne kaha tha ki ve sitambar tak 4000 karod rupaya de sakate hai
 Banks said they will take all the money
 sochiye morishas kaa bank hyderabad tak pahunch kar lone difolter ke khilaaf warrant jari karvaa le rahaa he, hamaare bank yaheen se maalya ji se ummid kar rahe hai ki ve videsh main rahete hue bharat kaa paisa bharat bhijwa den
 It has become easier for IIT students to pay expensive fees
 dhyaan se sunen
 The fees of general students have been increased from 90,000 to two lakhs
 lekin chaatro ko do lakh dene main dikkat na aae isliye iaiti ke chaatro ko bina byaaj ke karj milegaa
 In the coming time, students of other institutions can also demand this wonderful facility
 jo paisa byaaj kaa lagegaa use fees main jodakar byaaj maaf kar diya jaae to unhen pataa bhi nahin chalegaa ki fees badi he
 The Ministry of Human Resources should congratulate that it has rejected the proposal to increase the fees threefold
 sirf do guna fees badhaai gai he
 Fees for the remaining students have also been waived
 hansega india badhegaa india sho local nahin he
 It also has international news
 britain kii sarkaar ke ek bade salaahkaar ne kaha he ki motopa mote aadmi kii samasya nahin he
 This problem is not due to the fat man who has become obese by eating too much
 telegraph akhbaar main khabar chhapi he ki isamen mote logon kii koi galati nahin he ki ve kam nahin kha pate hai
 The culprit for this is the same environment that Odd Even is relaunching in Delhi to fight
 thik he ki koi zyaada khaane par control nahin kar paata he lekin motopa ichhashakti ke rashtriya patan ke kaaran nahin hota he
 This also happens because the environment has changed
 is research ke baad mote log jam kar kha sakate hai ki ve apni vajah se nahin, paryaavaran ke kaarnon se mote ho rahe hai
 The comments bharat kab se pakistan ko sabak sikhaana chahta he lekin cricket match se aage baat nahin bad paati he
 But North Korea does not just talk like India
 wo kaalpanik video banaakar khush hota rahata he ki yahaan bam giraaya to vahaan dekho vahaan bam giraaya
 The title of this video is if the ultimatum is not answered
 ham north korea ke shukraguzaar hai ki usne iskaa tital maa kasam badla luungaa nahin rakhaa he
 In this video you can see Submarine has fired missile over Washington
 dakshin korea ke raashtrapati ke makaan blue house ko tabah kar detaa he
 In this way, he is selling the dream of attack in these countries in his country
 ham dinon din haasyaaspad hote ja rahe hai
 Just like we talk like a child sleeping on the roof when we go to power here, exactly the same thing North Korea is doing in this video
 ise maaraa aise maaraa sabko maaraa
 Singing to become a world winner video se rashtriya str par bhadaas nikaalane kaa aisa kaarykram aapane puri duniya main na dekha hoga
 The children of the city may not have seen the jungle but it is not that they cannot see the jungle book
 abhi to smart city nahin bana he isliye kam badanaami ho rahi he
 Think what would have happened in this era of smart city
 aap jaanate hai ki shuukravaar ko ek film reelij hui he jangal book
 Many of us have seen the serial form of this film on Doordarshan without any parental guidance
 nabbe ke dashak main
 But the highly sensitive Censor Board of India has given the film a u / a certificate
 yani baarah saal se kam ke bacchon ko ise dekhne ke liye maa baap ke saath janaa hoga
 Pahlaj Nihalani, chairman of the censor board, says that the film has a 3D effect
 sound effect chote bacchon ke liye daraavna ho saktaa he
 Anyway, where would the parents let such young children go alone to the cinema hall
 magar is faisle kaa mazaaq ud rahaa he
 Those on Twitter who are older than twelve years are not serious on this decision
 kaaphi hans rahe hai
 Not only this, while living in jail, Vanzara must have missed his service revolver too
 shaayad isiilie jab ahmedabad airport se baahar nikle to ek kaarykram main pahunche or manch par talwaar dance kaa namoona pesh kiya
 Danced with a sword as if someone had won the war
 bharat shanti kaa pujari rahaa he lekin aisa nahin he ki log talwaar chalaanaa bhul gaye hai
 When the bridegroom can go to the wedding with a sword, how can you stop someone from dancing the sword when you come from jail
 is tasviir par aap hans hi sakate hai kyonki rone se koi phayda nahin
 This can happen in India at all
 vaise banjaaraa sahab jis tarah se talwaar bhanj rahe hai lagata he ki itane saal jail main rahane ke baad bhi ve apni puraani aadaten nahin bhuule hai
 Now we do not know whether in Indian jails, inmates are trained to stab swords or not
 hats aaf tu him and you tu coffee vid karan sho to aapane dekha hi hoga
 You must have heard about the discussion on tea
 coffee vid captain suna tha kya
 Talk to tea has now reached coffee
 abhi modi ji assam se aa jaaenge to kahenge ki congress amiron kii party he
 Drinks coffee
 coffee pilaati he
 Where did the money come from mitron ham kaaphi nahin pilaa sakate hai
 Donate to us ham garib log hai tabhi to main chaay bechata tha
 Then the quarrel will arrive at the cost of the suit and on Mallya's ship
 isse pehle ham kaaphi vid captain pi le lete hai
 However, what people in Punjab like to drink has been banned in Bihar
 lekin punjab main captain hote hai
 He was also the captain of hockey before
 cricket ke captain hue magar coffee vid captain koi nahin hua
 Amarinder Singh is the leader of the Congress
 mujhe lagata he ki ve pradhanmantri modi kii style churaane ko lekar kaaphi pareshaan the lekin chaay bechney par modi ji kaa aisa copirite he ki kisi netaa ke liye dupliket bananaa bahut mushkil he
 As a result, this idea has come with Coffee with Captain
 pradhanmantri modi ne haal hi main kaha tha ki ve assam kii chaay bechate the
 Tea was discussed for two years but neither the PM told nor the people asked him what tea you used to sell
 khud hi piem ne bataa diya ki ve assam kii chaay bechate the
 They are the only teas that still remember what place they used to sell tea twenty-five or thirty years ago
 yaad nahin hota to ve darjeeling tii kaa bhi naam le sakate the magar nahin liya
 You know that there is no coffee in Punjab
 chaay koun si gujarat main hoti he
 Coffee is grown in Karnataka
 karnataka ke congressi mukhyamantri pareshaan hi honge ki coffee ugaate wo hai or pilaa captain sahab rahe hai
 We have heard that no coffee drinker is being found in Punjab
 jab tak nahin miltaa kya aisa ho saktaa he ki captain sahab coffee vid karan ke set par chale jaaen
 Karan Johar will be a little upset but he can leave the set by swearing at Punjab
 phir unke saamne shilpa se lekar karina jo bhi ho unke saath kaaphi par charchaa kar len
 If Coffee With Captain hits, what will happen to Coffee with Karan
 ye sochane kaa time nahin he
 Time to drink yah bhi ho saktaa he ki coffee vid karan bhi congress gaanv gaanv main dikhaa sakati he
 What has been the popular show, do you know that dark clouds should be removed from it
 saath saal tak raaj karne kaa yah phayda hota he
 Then the Congress is drinking a lot
 thode din ruk jaaiye bijepi bhi pilaaegi
 However, BJP has appointed KP Maurya as the President of UP
 maurya sahab apane biodeta main likhte hai ki ve bachapan main chaay bechate the
 He also has ten criminal prosecutions
 vaise aap chaay par hi dhyaan den
 Anything can happen in BJP by selling tea
 pataa nahin congress main coffee bechney se kya hoga
 The news has come that Rashtriya Lok Dal is going to merge with Janata Dal United
 rashtriya lokdal ke netaa ajit singh bahut jamaane ke baad apni party ke saath vilay kar rahe hai
 Till now they used to combine and would become ministers in any government
 meraa apana anumaan he ki akele vilay karte karte bor ho gaye honge to is baar apni party kaa hi vilay karne kaa plan bana liya he
 Ajit Singh has very little luck
 unke paas mantrimandal or tasveeron kaa portpholio shandaar he
 In this photo, he is putting his hand on the back of Akhilesh Yadav
 is photo main ve amar singh ke saath hai
 In this photo he is with Rahul Gandhi
 is photo main ve prakaash karaat ke saath hai
 In this photo he is with Rajnath Singh
 is photo main baba ramdev ke saath hai
 In this photo he is with Mayawati
 is photo main ve nitish kumaar ke saath hai
 They are no longer alone
 unki party bhi ab nitish ke saath he
 If such leaders start merging their party then the loneliness of the national parties will increase
 sochiye bijepi or congress gathbandhan ke liye kiske paas jaaengi
 Whatever you want to see Ajit Singh's political album, then take the time and visit him
 1998 main unhone rashtriya lok dal banaaya tha
 After 18 years of running the party, after being with many parties and leaders, Ajit Singh is now entrusting the responsibility of running his party to Nitish Kumar
 rashtriya ke saath saath antarrashtriya khabaren bhi
 Due to the discussion of Bharat Mata ki Jai in India, the expectations of people internationally have increased
 yahaan kai logon ne kaha he ki bharat main rahanaa he to bharat mata kii jai bolnaa hoga
 Hearing this, there is a stir in Europe
 vahaan log apni bas or naav mode kar bharat kii taraf chal padane kii baat karne lage hai
 The refugees of Europe have since heard that to stay in India, they have to be very excited
 siria, pakistan, afghanistan, iraq, kosovo, albenia, nigeria, iraan or ukraine se lakhon log europe main sharnaarthi banane ke liye aavedan de rahe hai
 Most of these people want to live in Germany
 saadhe chaar lakh se adhik logon ne germany main rahane kaa aplication diya he
 If they come to know that someone from India is offering that only by saying Bharat Mata ki Jai can get an opportunity to stay in India, then refugees can turn their boats towards India
 bharat bhi duutavaason main visa counter kii jagah bharat mata kii jai counter khol saktaa he
 Any refugee who comes to this counter and utters Bharat Mata ki Jai can be given a visa to visit India
 duniya bhar main visa dene kaa yah sabase aasaan niyam hoga
 Parinde is upset
 assam kii chunavi raily main bijepi adhyaksh ne kah diya ki hamaari sarkaar ai to bangladesh se parinda bhi par nahin maar paaegaa
 Ajmal understands the problem, but what is the problem with the birds
 paridon ko laga ki kahin parinda mukt bharat kii baat to nahin ho rahi he
 Upon hearing the flyover of the Defense Colony, Parinde bowed his head silent
 chintan manan karne lage ki insaanon ke siyaasi jhagade main ve kahaan se funs gaye
 Nobody was thinking of any way
 to inhen main ek udan ratna puraskaar se sammanit chuun chuun parinde ne hal nikaala
 Parinde said that this is an attack on our right to fly
 parinde par nahin maarenge to kya karenge
 Who is this sky for? ye zamin kiske liye hai
 We are no country of birds
 hamaara to akaash hota he
 If we want to go to Pakistan, go to Bangladesh and come back to India in the evening
 pareshaan parinde kabhi udate rahe, kabhi lautate rahe
 It was decided that Parinda will return his Udyan Ratna Award in protest against this statement of Amit Shah
 media ke saamne parindon ne ud ud kar apana virodh bhi jataayaa he
 Humans are told not to tie the boundaries of the borders
 insaanon ko rokna he to roke
 Let us not stop the birds in his name
 ab amit shah ko dar he ki parindon ke is virodh ko aam aadmi party na saport kar de
 Do not divert them on the wrong path by reciting the Kumar Vishwas poem
 parindon or paalatuon ke prati samvedansheel mantri menka gandhi ne apni chuppi nahin todi he
 Meanwhile, there has been confusion over what punishment should be given to those who do not speak Bharat Mata Ki Jai
 desh se baahar bheja jaae, unka sar kaat diya jaae yaa jabada ukhada jaae
 The first two types of punishments have come under discussion, the idea of jaw-breaking has not yet come up
 shuukravaar ke indian express main chhapi he ye khabar
 Brijmohan Aggarwal is a minister of Chhattisgarh
 inhen lagata he ki baba ramdev kaa gardan kaatane vaala idia pasand nahin aayaa
 Aggarwal, following him a bit, said that if someone in front of our workers would raise anti-national slogans, then we have the strength to lift their jaws
 agar hindustan kii dharti par tumne janam liya he
 You are eating food on the land of India and even after you die, if you get two gazes of land, then you will have to say 'bharat Mata ki Jai' on the land of India
 maine jabada todane kii baat to suni thi, ukhaadne kaa copirite agarwal ji kaa lagata he
 We asked a dentist how the jaw is lifted
 to unhone kaha bahut gambhir maamle main hi jabada ukhda jaataa he
 One and a half hour surgery is done
 bijepi ke kaaryakarta itnaa time lagaayenge to har zile main ek lakh namo ap downlod karwaane kaa target miss kar sakate hai
 When they work as a dentist, when will they download? amit shah ne kaha he ki har zile main ek lakh namo ap downlod hona chahie
 What is going to happen by not speaking so much suffering
 isse to acha he ki na bolne vaale jai bol hi den
 How angry those who ask to speak have become
 kuch to naa bolne waalon ko sochna chahie
 Swami Agnivesh has written an article in the Indian Express on Baba Ramdev's statement that his beheading statement is anti-religion
 agnivesh ji ko padhate hue main pro ramdev ho gaya
 If Baba did not love humanity, he would not make pickles, biscuits or flour for human consumption
 unka gussa agnivesh nahin samaj paa rahe hai
 Baba knows that if the millions of heads are cut off, then the noodles eaters will reduce
 phir bhi wo ye gussa bardaasht nahin kar paa rahe hai
 Thankfully, there is a constitution in the country
 unhone kaha ki is desh main kanoon he, nahin to teri ek kii kya, ham to lakhon kii gardan kaat sakate hai
 i am very sure that Baba will not do this
 gusse main kah gaye hai
 Swami will make atonement by reading Agnivesh's article
 lakhon sar kaat kar apane aate or noodles kaa nuksaan koun karegaa
 There is something that Baba did not get so angry even when he did not get black money
 nahin bolne vaale bhi kam nahin hai
 If you do not want to speak, do not speak, it is important to speak in front of Baba or not
 khwamkhah apane sar ko risk zone main kyon daalana chaahate ho bhai
 Several cases of corruption are under investigation against Himachal Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh
 unhone teen baar bharat mata kii jai bol kar congress ko bhi kanphyus kar diya he
 Virbhadra Singh said that i am a true patriot
 dil se rashtravaadi hum
 The BJP is also confused by Virbhadra Singh's Bharat Mata ki Jai
 wo samaj nahin paa rahi he ki aalochana kare yaa swaagat kare
 Virbhadra Singh has said that he will now raise the slogan of Bharat Mata ki Jai at every function
 is bich kohinoor heere ko lekar rashtrawaad sankat main aa gaya he
 The people of India and the news agencies have been claiming Kohinoor, but a Supreme Court comment may put the Kohinoor side of Indian nationalism in jeopardy
 supreme court main kohinoor ko bharat laane kii maang ko lekar yachika daayar kii gai he
 Subramanian Swamy and Prashant Bhushan, famous for the petitions, have not filed this petition
 ol india human ritis and soshal justise front ne daayar kii he
 The petitioner has also spoken of making the British High Commissioner a party
 supreme court ne kaha he ki dakshin africa, pakistan or bangladesh samet kai desh kohinoor par apana haq jataa chuke hai
 It has done what the government had to do
 phir bhi solicitre general se raay maangi gai he
 Why are you asking for a diamond that is claimed by many countries? na bolne ke liye mashhoor purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne bolne ke liye mashhoor maujuuda pradhanmantri narendra modi ko salaah di he
 It is said that there is more importance than speaking
 modi ji ko ye salaah dene ke liye manmohan singh ne bolaa he ye news he
 Before the 2014 elections, Modi used to tell Manmohan Singh that if he has done anything, then also speak
 bich main kuch muddon par jab modi ji chup hue to congressi netaaon ko manmohan singh kii yaad aane lagi he or ve modi ji ko maun modi kehane lage
 Did not understand that he was criticizing Modi ji or his former Prime Minister
 maun modi kehane se modi ji bhi kanphyus ho gaye honge isile unhone kai muddon par bolaa hi nahin
 Meanwhile, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has said that those whose names have appeared in the Panama Papers will have a sleepless night
 aise logon ko meri salaah he ki subah subah hi indian express pard len jisamen panama papers par rose kuch na kuch chap rahaa he or din main hi so len taaki raaton ko neend na aane par koi pareshaani na ho
 Now let's move to the next news
 hansega india to badhegaa india
 Don't add this slogan of Friday to Start Up India, Stand Up India
 hamaara makasad yahi he ki raajnneetik bahason ko lekar jo katutaa he wo thodi kam ho jaae
 Do not judge everything on the scale of facts
 aap jaanate hai ki do log bhaag gaye hai
 One has fled abroad and is in a country, but it is not known
 modi sarkaar ke ek mantri vaai es choudhary ko aapane kisi bas stand par dekha ho to turant telugana police ko ittela kar den
 The court sent three summons to Chaudhary Saheb but he could not appear
 ve kendriya mantrimandal main vigyaan evam technalji rajya mantri hai
 My own humor is that they might be hidden in a science lab
 marishas ke ek bank ne inke khilaaf shikaayat kii he ki choudhary ji uskaa lone nahin chukaa rahe hai
 Same to Sem Indian banks have complained that Mallya saheb is not paying their loan
 kahin aisa to nahin ki ye donon exange program ke tahat gaayab ho gaye hai
 a non-bailable warrant has been issued against Chaudhary
 inhen mantrimandal se shaayad isliye bhi nahin hataaya gaya he ki kya pataa mantripad ke laalach main ye bhaag hi na paaen
 The minister has told the court that he has some important work in Delhi, so the courts are unable to come
 mujhe mantri ji kii baat par puraa bharosa he kyonki unhone nyaaypalika ke sammaan kii baat kahi he
 So trust because YS Chaudhary owes only 106 crores to the bank of another country
 maalya sahab to 9000 karod lekar bhaage hai, sochiye bainkon kaa dil kitna dhadkta hoga
 In this panic, banks have turned down Mallya's proposal
 maalya ne kaha tha ki ve sitambar tak 4000 karod rupaya de sakate hai
 Banks said they will take all the money
 sochiye morishas kaa bank hyderabad tak pahunch kar lone difolter ke khilaaf warrant jari karvaa le rahaa he, hamaare bank yaheen se maalya ji se ummid kar rahe hai ki ve videsh main rahete hue bharat kaa paisa bharat bhijwa den

 Do not divert them on the wrong path by reciting the Kumar Vishwas poem
 parindon or paalatuon ke prati samvedansheel mantri menka gandhi ne apni chuppi nahin todi he
 Meanwhile, there has been confusion over what punishment should be given to those who do not speak Bharat Mata Ki Jai
 desh se baahar bheja jaae, unka sar kaat diya jaae yaa jabada ukhada jaae
 The first two types of punishments have come under discussion, the idea of jaw-breaking has not yet come up
 shuukravaar ke indian express main chhapi he ye khabar
 Brijmohan Aggarwal is a minister of Chhattisgarh
 inhen lagata he ki baba ramdev kaa gardan kaatane vaala idia pasand nahin aayaa
 Aggarwal, following him a bit, said that if someone in front of our workers would raise anti-national slogans, then we have the strength to lift their jaws
 agar hindustan kii dharti par tumne janam liya he
 You are eating food on the land of India and even after you die, if you get two gazes of land, then you will have to say 'bharat Mata ki Jai' on the land of India
 maine jabada todane kii baat to suni thi, ukhaadne kaa copirite agarwal ji kaa lagata he
 We asked a dentist how the jaw is lifted
 to unhone kaha bahut gambhir maamle main hi jabada ukhda jaataa he
 One and a half hour surgery is done
 bijepi ke kaaryakarta itnaa time lagaayenge to har zile main ek lakh namo ap downlod karwaane kaa target miss kar sakate hai
 When they work as a dentist, when will they download? amit shah ne kaha he ki har zile main ek lakh namo ap downlod hona chahie
 What is going to happen by not speaking so much suffering
 isse to acha he ki na bolne vaale jai bol hi den
 How angry those who ask to speak have become
 kuch to naa bolne waalon ko sochna chahie
 Swami Agnivesh has written an article in the Indian Express on Baba Ramdev's statement that his beheading statement is anti-religion
 agnivesh ji ko padhate hue main pro ramdev ho gaya
 If Baba did not love humanity, he would not make pickles, biscuits or flour for human consumption
 unka gussa agnivesh nahin samaj paa rahe hai
 Baba knows that if the millions of heads are cut off, then the noodles eaters will reduce
 phir bhi wo ye gussa bardaasht nahin kar paa rahe hai
 Thankfully, there is a constitution in the country
 unhone kaha ki is desh main kanoon he, nahin to teri ek kii kya, ham to lakhon kii gardan kaat sakate hai
 i am very sure that Baba will not do this
 gusse main kah gaye hai
 Swami will make atonement by reading Agnivesh's article
 lakhon sar kaat kar apane aate or noodles kaa nuksaan koun karegaa
 There is something that Baba did not get so angry even when he did not get black money
 nahin bolne vaale bhi kam nahin hai
 If you do not want to speak, do not speak, it is important to speak in front of Baba or not
 khwamkhah apane sar ko risk zone main kyon daalana chaahate ho bhai
 Several cases of corruption are under investigation against Himachal Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh
 unhone teen baar bharat mata kii jai bol kar congress ko bhi kanphyus kar diya he
 Virbhadra Singh said that i am a true patriot
 dil se rashtravaadi hum
 The BJP is also confused by Virbhadra Singh's Bharat Mata ki Jai
 wo samaj nahin paa rahi he ki aalochana kare yaa swaagat kare
 Virbhadra Singh has said that he will now raise the slogan of Bharat Mata ki Jai at every function
 is bich kohinoor heere ko lekar rashtrawaad sankat main aa gaya he
 The people of India and the news agencies have been claiming Kohinoor, but a Supreme Court comment may put the Kohinoor side of Indian nationalism in jeopardy
 supreme court main kohinoor ko bharat laane kii maang ko lekar yachika daayar kii gai he
 Subramanian Swamy and Prashant Bhushan, famous for the petitions, have not filed this petition
 ol india human ritis and soshal justise front ne daayar kii he
 The petitioner has also spoken of making the British High Commissioner a party
 supreme court ne kaha he ki dakshin africa, pakistan or bangladesh samet kai desh kohinoor par apana haq jataa chuke hai
 It has done what the government had to do
 phir bhi solicitre general se raay maangi gai he
 Why are you asking for a diamond that is claimed by many countries? na bolne ke liye mashhoor purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne bolne ke liye mashhoor maujuuda pradhanmantri narendra modi ko salaah di he
 It is said that there is more importance than speaking
 modi ji ko ye salaah dene ke liye manmohan singh ne bolaa he ye news he
 Before the 2014 elections, Modi used to tell Manmohan Singh that if he has done anything, then also speak
 bich main kuch muddon par jab modi ji chup hue to congressi netaaon ko manmohan singh kii yaad aane lagi he or ve modi ji ko maun modi kehane lage
 Did not understand that he was criticizing Modi ji or his former Prime Minister
 maun modi kehane se modi ji bhi kanphyus ho gaye honge isile unhone kai muddon par bolaa hi nahin
 Meanwhile, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has said that those whose names have appeared in the Panama Papers will have a sleepless night
 aise logon ko meri salaah he ki subah subah hi indian express pard len jisamen panama papers par rose kuch na kuch chap rahaa he or din main hi so len taaki raaton ko neend na aane par koi pareshaani na ho
 Now let's move to the next news
 hansega india to badhegaa india
 Don't add this slogan of Friday to Start Up India, Stand Up India
 hamaara makasad yahi he ki raajnneetik bahason ko lekar jo katutaa he wo thodi kam ho jaae
 Do not judge everything on the scale of facts
 aap jaanate hai ki do log bhaag gaye hai
 One has fled abroad and is in a country, but it is not known
 modi sarkaar ke ek mantri vaai es choudhary ko aapane kisi bas stand par dekha ho to turant telugana police ko ittela kar den
 The court sent three summons to Chaudhary Saheb but he could not appear
 ve kendriya mantrimandal main vigyaan evam technalji rajya mantri hai
 My own humor is that they might be hidden in a science lab
 marishas ke ek bank ne inke khilaaf shikaayat kii he ki choudhary ji uskaa lone nahin chukaa rahe hai
 Same to Sem Indian banks have complained that Mallya saheb is not paying their loan
 kahin aisa to nahin ki ye donon exange program ke tahat gaayab ho gaye hai
 a non-bailable warrant has been issued against Chaudhary
 inhen mantrimandal se shaayad isliye bhi nahin hataaya gaya he ki kya pataa mantripad ke laalach main ye bhaag hi na paaen
 The minister has told the court that he has some important work in Delhi, so the courts are unable to come
 mujhe mantri ji kii baat par puraa bharosa he kyonki unhone nyaaypalika ke sammaan kii baat kahi he
 So trust because YS Chaudhary owes only 106 crores to the bank of another country
 maalya sahab to 9000 karod lekar bhaage hai, sochiye bainkon kaa dil kitna dhadkta hoga
 In this panic, banks have turned down Mallya's proposal
 maalya ne kaha tha ki ve sitambar tak 4000 karod rupaya de sakate hai
 Banks said they will take all the money
 sochiye morishas kaa bank hyderabad tak pahunch kar lone difolter ke khilaaf warrant jari karvaa le rahaa he, hamaare bank yaheen se maalya ji se ummid kar rahe hai ki ve videsh main rahete hue bharat kaa paisa bharat bhijwa den
 It has become easier for IIT students to pay expensive fees
 dhyaan se sunen
 The fees of general students have been increased from 90,000 to two lakhs
 lekin chaatro ko do lakh dene main dikkat na aae isliye iaiti ke chaatro ko bina byaaj ke karj milegaa
 In the coming time, students of other institutions can also demand this wonderful facility
 jo paisa byaaj kaa lagegaa use fees main jodakar byaaj maaf kar diya jaae to unhen pataa bhi nahin chalegaa ki fees badi he
 The Ministry of Human Resources should congratulate that it has rejected the proposal to increase the fees threefold
 sirf do guna fees badhaai gai he
 Fees for the remaining students have also been waived
 hansega india badhegaa india sho local nahin he
 It also has international news
 britain kii sarkaar ke ek bade salaahkaar ne kaha he ki motopa mote aadmi kii samasya nahin he
 This problem is not due to the fat man who has become obese by eating too much
 telegraph akhbaar main khabar chhapi he ki isamen mote logon kii koi galati nahin he ki ve kam nahin kha pate hai
 The culprit for this is the same environment that Odd Even is relaunching in Delhi to fight
 thik he ki koi zyaada khaane par control nahin kar paata he lekin motopa ichhashakti ke rashtriya patan ke kaaran nahin hota he
 This also happens because the environment has changed
 is research ke baad mote log jam kar kha sakate hai ki ve apni vajah se nahin, paryaavaran ke kaarnon se mote ho rahe hai
 The comments bharat kab se pakistan ko sabak sikhaana chahta he lekin cricket match se aage baat nahin bad paati he
 But North Korea does not just talk like India
 wo kaalpanik video banaakar khush hota rahata he ki yahaan bam giraaya to vahaan dekho vahaan bam giraaya
 The title of this video is if the ultimatum is not answered
 ham north korea ke shukraguzaar hai ki usne iskaa tital maa kasam badla luungaa nahin rakhaa he
 In this video you can see Submarine has fired missile over Washington
 dakshin korea ke raashtrapati ke makaan blue house ko tabah kar detaa he
 In this way, he is selling the dream of attack in these countries in his country
 ham dinon din haasyaaspad hote ja rahe hai
 Just like we talk like a child sleeping on the roof when we go to power here, exactly the same thing North Korea is doing in this video
 ise maaraa aise maaraa sabko maaraa
 Singing to become a world winner video se rashtriya str par bhadaas nikaalane kaa aisa kaarykram aapane puri duniya main na dekha hoga
 The children of the city may not have seen the jungle but it is not that they cannot see the jungle book
 abhi to smart city nahin bana he isliye kam badanaami ho rahi he
 Think what would have happened in this era of smart city
 aap jaanate hai ki shuukravaar ko ek film reelij hui he jangal book
 Many of us have seen the serial form of this film on Doordarshan without any parental guidance
 nabbe ke dashak main
 But the highly sensitive Censor Board of India has given the film a u / a certificate
 yani baarah saal se kam ke bacchon ko ise dekhne ke liye maa baap ke saath janaa hoga
 Pahlaj Nihalani, chairman of the censor board, says that the film has a 3D effect
 sound effect chote bacchon ke liye daraavna ho saktaa he
 Anyway, where would the parents let such young children go alone to the cinema hall
 magar is faisle kaa mazaaq ud rahaa he
 Those on Twitter who are older than twelve years are not serious on this decision
 kaaphi hans rahe hai
 This is the advantage of ruling for sixty years
 tabhi congress kaaphi pilaa rahi he
 Wait a few days, the BJP will also feed
 vaise bijepi ne ke pi maury ko upi kaa adhyaksh banaaya he
 Maurya saheb writes in his curriculum vitae that he used to sell tea as a child
 un par das aapraadhik mukademe bhi hai
 By the way, you should focus on tea
 chaay bechney se bijepi main kuch bhi ho saktaa he
 i do not know what will happen by selling coffee in Congress
 khabar ai he ki rashtriya lok dal kaa janata dal unitate main vilay hone vaala he
 National Lok Dal leader Ajit Singh is merging with his party after a long time
 abhi tak ve gathbandhan karte the or mantri banakar kisi bhi sarkaar main wilin ho jate the
 My own guess is that if you are bored by merging alone then this time you have made a plan to merge your party
 ajit singh kii kismat bahut kam kii hoti he
 He has an excellent cabinet and portfolio of photographs
 is photo main ve akhilesh yadav kii peeth par haath rakh rahe hai
 In this photo he is with Amar Singh
 is photo main ve rahul gandhi ke saath hai
 In this photo he is with Prakash Karat
 is photo main ve rajnath singh ke saath hai
 Baba is with Ramdev in this photo
 is photo main ve mayawati ke saath hai
 In this photo he is with Nitish Kumar
 ab ve akele saath nahin he
 His party is also with Nitish now
 agar is tarah netaa apni party kaa vilay karne lage to rashtriya partiyon kaa akelaapan bad jayega
 Think who will go to the BJP and Congress alliance
 jo bhi he ajit singh kaa raajnneetik album dekhnaa ho to time lekar unke paas jaaiyegaa
 In 1998, he formed the Rashtriya Lok Dal
 18 saal party chalaane ke baad, kai dalon va netaaon ke saath rahane ke baad ajit singh ab apni party chalaane kii zimmedaari nitish kumaar ko saunp rahe hai
 National as well as international news
 bharat main ho rahi bharat mata kii jai kii charchaa se antarrashtriya str par logon kii ummiden bad gai he
 Many people here have said that if you want to live in India, then Bharat Mata ki Jai will have to be spoken
 ise sunate hi europe main halchal much rahi he
 There people have started talking about turning their bus and boat towards India
 europe ke sharnaarthiyon ne jab se suna he ki bharat main rahane ke liye bharat mata kii jai bolnaa hoga ve kaaphi utsahit nazar aa rahe hai
 Millions of people from Syria, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iraq, Kosovo, Albania, Nigeria, Iran and Ukraine are applying to become refugees in Europe
 inamen se sabase zyada log germany main rahanaa chaahate hai
 Over four and a half million people have applied to live in Germany
 agar inhen pataa chal gaya ki bharat se koi ye ofer kar rahaa he ki sirf bharat mata kii jai kehane se bharat main rahane kaa mauka mil saktaa he to sharnaarthi apni naaven bharat kii taraf mode sakate hai
 India can also open Bharat Mata Ki Jai counter instead of visa counter in embassies
 jo bhi sharnaarthi is counter par aakar bharat mata kii jai bolegaa use bharat jane kaa visa diya ja saktaa he
 This would be the easiest rule to grant visas worldwide
 parinde pareshaan hai
 At the election rally in Assam, the BJP president said that if our government comes, even Parinda from Bangladesh will not be able to kill her
 ajmal se problem to samaj aata he, magar parindon se kya problem he
 The councils felt that there was no talk of Parinda free India
 sunate hi dephence colony ke fliover par parinde sar jhukaa kar khamosh ho gaye
 They started thinking about where they got caught in the political quarrel of humans
 kisi ko koi rasta nahin sujh rahaa tha
 So, in this only one Udyan Ratna Awardee, Chinde Parinde found a solution
 chuun chuun parinde ne kaha ki ye hamaare udne ke adhikaar par hamalaa he
 What will we do if we do not kill Parinde? ye akaash kiske liye he
 Who is this land for? ham parindon kaa koi mulk nahin hota
 We have a sky
 ham chahen to pakistan jaaen, chahen to bangladesh jaaen or shaam ko lautakar bharat aa jaaen
 Distressed birds kept flying, sometimes returning
 tay hua ki chuun chuun parinda amit shah ke is bayaan ke virodh main apana udan ratna puraskaar waapas karegaa
 In front of the media, birds have also expressed their opposition by flying away
 insaanon se kaha he ki ve parindon ke par ko simaaon main na baandhen
 If humans want to stop then stop
 unke naam par ham parindon ko na roke
 Now Amit Shah is afraid that the Aam Aadmi Party should not support this opposition of the birds
 kahin inhen kumaar vishwaas kavita sunaakar galat raste par na bhatka de
 Maneka Gandhi, a sensitive minister for birds and pets, has not broken her silence
 is bich bharat mata kii jai nahin bolne waalon ko kya sazaa di jaae ise lekar kanfusion ho gaya he
 Be sent out of the country, beheaded or jawed
 pehle do prakaar kii sazaayen to charchaa main aa chuki hai, jai nahin bolne par jabada ukhaadne kaa idia abhi abhi aayaa he
 This news appeared in Friday's Indian Express
 chhattisgarh ke ek mantri hai brijmohan agarwal
 He feels that Baba Ramdev did not like the idea of cutting his neck
 agarwal ne usase thodaa peeche rahete hue kaha ki hamaare kaaryakartaaon ke saamne agar koi rashtravirohi naare lagayegaa to ham unke jabade ko ukhaadne kii takat rakhte hai
 If you have taken birth on the land of India
 hindustan kii dharti kaa ann kha rahe ho or tumhaare marane ke baad bhi tumhen agar do gaz zamin milegi to hindustan kii dharti par milegi isliye bharat mata kii jai bolnaa padegaa
 i had heard of breaking the jaw, the copyright of uprooting seems to be that of Agrawal
 hamane ek dentist se poocha ki jabada kaise ukhada jaataa he
 So he said that in a very serious case, the jaw is broken
 ek dedh ghante kii surgery hoti he
 If BJP workers spend so much time, then they can miss the target of downloading one lakh Namo app in every district
 wo dentist kaa kaam karenge to downlod kab karenge
 Amit Shah has said that every district should have one lakh Namo app downloads
 itani takalif sahakar naa bolne se kya milane vaala he
 It is better not to say no to Jai
 bolne kii maang karne vaale kitne naaraaz ho gaye hai
 Those who say nothing should think
 swami agnivesh ne baba ramdev ke bayaan par indian express main ek lekh likhaa he ki unka sar kaatane vaala bayaan dharm virdohi he
 i became Prof
 Ramdev while reading Agnivesh ji
 agar baba maanavtaa ko pyaar na karte to maanav ke khaane ke liye achaar, biscuit yaa aataa nahin banaate
 His anger is not understood by Agnivesh
 baba ko pataa he ki lakhon sar kaat denge to noodles khaane vaale kam ho jaaenge
 Still they are unable to bear this anger
 ganimat he ki desh main samvidhan he
 He said that there is a law in this country, if not your one, we can cut the neck of millions
 mujhe puraa yakeen he ki baba aisa nahin karenge
 Have said in anger
 swami agnivesh kaa lekh padhakar praayshchit karenge
 Who will harm their flour and noodles by cutting millions of heads
 kuch to he ki baba ko kaala dhan na aane par bhi itnaa gussa nahin aayaa
 No speakers are no less
 nahin bolnaa he to na bolen, baba ke saamne jaakar bolnaa zaruri he ki nahin bolenge
 Khwamkhah why do you want to put your head in the risk zone, brother
 himachal ke mukhyamantri virbhadra singh ke khilaaf bhrashtachar ke kai maamalon kii jaanch chal rahi he
 He has also confused Congress three times by uttering Bharat Mata Ki Jai
 virbhadra singh ne kaha ki main sachcha deshbhakt hum
 i am a nationalist at heart
 bijepi bhi virbhadra singh ke bharat mata kii jai bolne se kanphyus he
 She is unable to understand whether to criticize or to welcome
 virbhadra singh ne kaha he ki ve ab har samaaroh main bharat mata kii jai kaa naaraa lagaayenge
 Meanwhile, the Kohinoor diamond has come under nationalism
 kohinoor par bharat ke log or news agencia daawa karti rahi hai lekin supreme court kii ek tippanee se bhartiya rashtrawaad kaa kohinoor paksh sankat main pad saktaa he
 a petition has been filed in the Supreme Court seeking to bring Kohinoor to India
 yachikaaon ke liye mashhoor subramanyam swami or prashanth bhushan ne ye yachika daayar nahin kii he
 The All India Human Rights and Social Justice Front has filed
 yachikakarta ne british ucchayukta ko bhi party banane kii baat kahi he
 The Supreme Court has said that many countries including South Africa, Pakistan and Bangladesh have asserted their right to Kohinoor
 sarkaar ko jo karnaa tha usne kiya he
 Nevertheless the solicitor general has been asked for opinion
 ab aisa hira kyon maang rahe hai jis par kai deshon kaa daawa he
 Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, famous for not speaking, has advised the current Prime Minister Narendra Modi who is famous for speaking
 kaha he ki bolne se zyaada mahatv karne kaa hota he
 Manmohan Singh has said to give this advice to Modi ji, this is news
 2014 ke chunaav se pehle modi ji manmohan singh se kaha karte the ki kuch kiya bhi he to bolaa bhi kiijie
 When Modi ji kept silent on some issues in the middle, the Congress leaders started remembering Manmohan Singh and started calling Modi ji as Silent Modi
 samaj hi nahin aayaa ki ve modi ji kii aalochana kar rahe hai yaa apane purv pradhanmantri kii
 Modi ji would have been confused because of saying silent Modi, so he did not speak on many issues
 is bich vitt mantri arun jetali ne kaha he ki jinke naam panama papers main aae hai unki raaton kii neend ud jaaegi
 My advice to such people is to read the Indian Express early in the morning in which Panama is printing something on the papers every day and sleep in the day itself so that there is no problem if you do not sleep at night
 ab badhate hai agali khabar par
 India will laugh, India will grow
 shuukravaar ke hamaare is naare ko aap start ap india, stand ap india se na joden
 Our aim is to reduce the bitterness about political debates
 har baat ko tathyon ke paimaane par na parakhen
 You know that two people have run away
 ek to videsh bhaag gaye hai or ek desh main he magar pataa nahin chal rahaa he
 If you have seen a Modi government minister YS Chaudhary at a bus stand, then immediately inform the Telangana police
 choudhary sahab ko adaalat ne teen teen saman bheje lekin ve haazir nahin ho sake
 He is the Minister of State for Science and Technology in the Union Cabinet
 meraa apana hasya anumaan he ki ve kisi science lab main chhipe ho sakate hai
 a bank in Mauritius has complained against him that Chaudhary Ji is not paying his loan
 saim tu saim bhartiya bainkon ne shikaayat kii he ki maalya sahab unka lone nahin chukaa rahe hai
 Is it not that both of them have disappeared under the exchange program
 choudhary ji ke khilaaf gair jamaanti warrant jari hua he
 They have also not been removed from the cabinet because they do not know whether they can get this part in the greed of the minister
 mantri ji ne adaalat se kaha he ki unhen dilli main kuch zaruri kaam he isliye court nahin aa paa rahe hai
 i have full faith in the Minister's statement because he has spoken about the honor of the judiciary
 isliye bharosa he kyonki vaai es choudhary par sirf 106 karod kii dendaree he wo bhi duusare mulk ke bank kii
 Mallya sir has run away with 9000 crores, think how much the heart of banks will be beating
 is ghabrahat main bainkon ne maalya ke prastaav ko thukraa diya he
 Mallya had said that he could give Rs 4000 crore by September
 bainko ne kaha lenge to puraa paisa lenge
 Think Mauritius bank is reaching Hyderabad and getting warrant issued against loan defaulters, our banks are expecting Mallya to send money of India to India while abroad
 iaiti ke chaatro ke liye mahangi fees dena aasaan ho gaya he
 Listen carefully
 general chaatro kii fees 90,000 se badhaakar do lakh kar di gai he
 But there is no problem in giving two lakhs to the students, so the students of IIT will get loan without interest
 aane vaale samay main baaki sansthaanon ke chaatr bhi is laajawab suvidha kii maang kar sakate hai
 If the interest will be waived by adding the money that will be of interest, then they will not even know that the fees have increased
 maanav sansaadhan mantralay ko badhai deni chahie ki teen guna fees badhaane ke prastaav ko naamanzoor kar diya he
 The fees have been increased only twice
 baaki chaatro ke liye fees maaf bhi kar di gai he
 Hansega India Badhega India Show is not local
 isamen international news bhi he
 a big UK government advisor has said that obesity is not a problem of the fat man
 ye samasya us mote aadmi ke kaaran nahin he jiske zyaada khaane se motaa hua he
 There has been a news report in the Telegraph newspaper that there is no fault of obese people that they do not eat less
 iskaa doshi vahi paryaavaran he jisase ladane ke liye dilli main od evan phir se launch ho rahaa he
 Well, one cannot control overeating, but obesity is not due to the national decline of willpower
 isliye bhi hota he ki paryaavaran badal gaya he
 After this research, obese people can eat very hard that they are getting fat due to environmental reasons, not because of themselves
 tippaniyan Since when did India want to teach Pakistan a lesson, but the cricket match could not progress further
 lekin north korea bharat kii tarah sirf baaten nahin karata he
 He is happy to make a fictional video that if dropped a bomb here, look there and drop a bomb there
 is video kaa tital he agar ultimatum kaa jawaab nahin mila to
 We are thankful to North Korea that it has not changed its title mother
 is video main aap dekh sakate hai sabamarine ne washington ke upar missile daag diya he
 The House of the President of South Korea devastates the Blue House
 is tarah se wo apane mulk main in deshon main hamale kaa sapana bech rahaa he
 We are getting ridiculous day by day
 jaise hamaare yahaan bijli jane par chat par sote hue bachche jaisi baaten karte hai thik waisi baaten uttari korea is video main kar rahaa he
 Hit it like this, hit everyone
 vishwa vijeta ban gaae
 You may not have seen such a program of provoking anger at the national level from the video
 shahar ke bacchon ne bhale jangal nahin dekha he lekin aisa nahin ki ve jangal book nahin dekh sakate hai
 The smart city is not yet built, so it is becoming less infamous
 sochiye smart city ke daur main aisa hota to kya hota
 You know that Jungle Book has released a film on Friday
 is film ke siriyal rup ko hamamen se kai log doordarshan par bina maa baap ke gidence ke dekh chuke hai
 In the nineties
 lekin bharat ke ati samvedansheel sensor board ne is film ko you / e certificate diya he
 That is, children under twelve years have to go with the parents to see it
 sensor board ke chairman pehlaaj nihlani kaa kahana he ki is film main thridi effect he
 Sound effects can be scary for young children
 vaise bhi maa baap itane chote bacchon ko akele to cinema haal jane kahaan dete
 But this decision is mocking
 twitor par jo log baarah saal se bade hai wo is faisle par sirius nahin he
 Laughing a lot abhi tak ve gathbandhan karte the or mantri banakar kisi bhi sarkaar main wilin ho jate the
 My own guess is that if you are bored by merging alone then this time you have made a plan to merge your party
 ajit singh kii kismat bahut kam kii hoti he
 He has an excellent cabinet and portfolio of photographs

 In front of the media, birds have also expressed their opposition by flying away
 insaanon se kaha he ki ve parindon ke par ko simaaon main na baandhen
 If humans want to stop then stop
 unke naam par ham parindon ko na roke
 Now Amit Shah is afraid that the Aam Aadmi Party should not support this opposition of the birds
 kahin inhen kumaar vishwaas kavita sunaakar galat raste par na bhatka de
 Maneka Gandhi, a sensitive minister for birds and pets, has not broken her silence
 is bich bharat mata kii jai nahin bolne waalon ko kya sazaa di jaae ise lekar kanfusion ho gaya he
 Be sent out of the country, beheaded or jawed
 pehle do prakaar kii sazaayen to charchaa main aa chuki hai, jai nahin bolne par jabada ukhaadne kaa idia abhi abhi aayaa he
 This news appeared in Friday's Indian Express
 chhattisgarh ke ek mantri hai brijmohan agarwal
 He feels that Baba Ramdev did not like the idea of cutting his neck
 agarwal ne usase thodaa peeche rahete hue kaha ki hamaare kaaryakartaaon ke saamne agar koi rashtravirohi naare lagayegaa to ham unke jabade ko ukhaadne kii takat rakhte hai
 If you have taken birth on the land of India
 hindustan kii dharti kaa ann kha rahe ho or tumhaare marane ke baad bhi tumhen agar do gaz zamin milegi to hindustan kii dharti par milegi isliye bharat mata kii jai bolnaa padegaa
 i had heard of breaking the jaw, the copyright of uprooting seems to be that of Agrawal
 hamane ek dentist se poocha ki jabada kaise ukhada jaataa he
 So he said that in a very serious case, the jaw is broken
 ek dedh ghante kii surgery hoti he
 If BJP workers spend so much time, then they can miss the target of downloading one lakh Namo app in every district
 wo dentist kaa kaam karenge to downlod kab karenge
 Amit Shah has said that every district should have one lakh Namo app downloads
 itani takalif sahakar naa bolne se kya milane vaala he
 It is better not to say no to Jai
 bolne kii maang karne vaale kitne naaraaz ho gaye hai
 Those who say nothing should think
 swami agnivesh ne baba ramdev ke bayaan par indian express main ek lekh likhaa he ki unka sar kaatane vaala bayaan dharm virdohi he
 i became Prof
 Ramdev while reading Agnivesh ji
 agar baba maanavtaa ko pyaar na karte to maanav ke khaane ke liye achaar, biscuit yaa aataa nahin banaate
 His anger is not understood by Agnivesh
 baba ko pataa he ki lakhon sar kaat denge to noodles khaane vaale kam ho jaaenge
 Still they are unable to bear this anger
 ganimat he ki desh main samvidhan he
 He said that there is a law in this country, if not your one, we can cut the neck of millions
 mujhe puraa yakeen he ki baba aisa nahin karenge
 Have said in anger
 swami agnivesh kaa lekh padhakar praayshchit karenge
 Who will harm their flour and noodles by cutting millions of heads
 kuch to he ki baba ko kaala dhan na aane par bhi itnaa gussa nahin aayaa
 No speakers are no less
 nahin bolnaa he to na bolen, baba ke saamne jaakar bolnaa zaruri he ki nahin bolenge
 Khwamkhah why do you want to put your head in the risk zone, brother
 himachal ke mukhyamantri virbhadra singh ke khilaaf bhrashtachar ke kai maamalon kii jaanch chal rahi he
 He has also confused Congress three times by uttering Bharat Mata Ki Jai
 virbhadra singh ne kaha ki main sachcha deshbhakt hum
 i am a nationalist at heart
 bijepi bhi virbhadra singh ke bharat mata kii jai bolne se kanphyus he
 She is unable to understand whether to criticize or to welcome
 virbhadra singh ne kaha he ki ve ab har samaaroh main bharat mata kii jai kaa naaraa lagaayenge
 Meanwhile, the Kohinoor diamond has come under nationalism
 kohinoor par bharat ke log or news agencia daawa karti rahi hai lekin supreme court kii ek tippanee se bhartiya rashtrawaad kaa kohinoor paksh sankat main pad saktaa he
 a petition has been filed in the Supreme Court seeking to bring Kohinoor to India
 yachikaaon ke liye mashhoor subramanyam swami or prashanth bhushan ne ye yachika daayar nahin kii he
 The All India Human Rights and Social Justice Front has filed
 yachikakarta ne british ucchayukta ko bhi party banane kii baat kahi he
 The Supreme Court has said that many countries including South Africa, Pakistan and Bangladesh have asserted their right to Kohinoor
 sarkaar ko jo karnaa tha usne kiya he
 Nevertheless the solicitor general has been asked for opinion
 ab aisa hira kyon maang rahe hai jis par kai deshon kaa daawa he
 Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, famous for not speaking, has advised the current Prime Minister Narendra Modi who is famous for speaking
 kaha he ki bolne se zyaada mahatv karne kaa hota he
 Manmohan Singh has said to give this advice to Modi ji, this is news
 2014 ke chunaav se pehle modi ji manmohan singh se kaha karte the ki kuch kiya bhi he to bolaa bhi kiijie
 When Modi ji kept silent on some issues in the middle, the Congress leaders started remembering Manmohan Singh and started calling Modi ji as Silent Modi
 samaj hi nahin aayaa ki ve modi ji kii aalochana kar rahe hai yaa apane purv pradhanmantri kii
 Modi ji would have been confused because of saying silent Modi, so he did not speak on many issues
 is bich vitt mantri arun jetali ne kaha he ki jinke naam panama papers main aae hai unki raaton kii neend ud jaaegi
 My advice to such people is to read the Indian Express early in the morning in which Panama is printing something on the papers every day and sleep in the day itself so that there is no problem if you do not sleep at night
 ab badhate hai agali khabar par
 India will laugh, India will grow
 shuukravaar ke hamaare is naare ko aap start ap india, stand ap india se na joden
 Our aim is to reduce the bitterness about political debates
 har baat ko tathyon ke paimaane par na parakhen
 You know that two people have run away
 ek to videsh bhaag gaye hai or ek desh main he magar pataa nahin chal rahaa he
 If you have seen a Modi government minister YS Chaudhary at a bus stand, then immediately inform the Telangana police
 choudhary sahab ko adaalat ne teen teen saman bheje lekin ve haazir nahin ho sake
 He is the Minister of State for Science and Technology in the Union Cabinet
 meraa apana hasya anumaan he ki ve kisi science lab main chhipe ho sakate hai
 a bank in Mauritius has complained against him that Chaudhary Ji is not paying his loan
 saim tu saim bhartiya bainkon ne shikaayat kii he ki maalya sahab unka lone nahin chukaa rahe hai
 Is it not that both of them have disappeared under the exchange program
 choudhary ji ke khilaaf gair jamaanti warrant jari hua he
 They have also not been removed from the cabinet because they do not know whether they can get this part in the greed of the minister
 mantri ji ne adaalat se kaha he ki unhen dilli main kuch zaruri kaam he isliye court nahin aa paa rahe hai
 i have full faith in the Minister's statement because he has spoken about the honor of the judiciary
 isliye bharosa he kyonki vaai es choudhary par sirf 106 karod kii dendaree he wo bhi duusare mulk ke bank kii
 Mallya sir has run away with 9000 crores, think how much the heart of banks will be beating
 is ghabrahat main bainkon ne maalya ke prastaav ko thukraa diya he
 Mallya had said that he could give Rs 4000 crore by September
 bainko ne kaha lenge to puraa paisa lenge
 Think Mauritius bank is reaching Hyderabad and getting warrant issued against loan defaulters, our banks are expecting Mallya to send money of India to India while abroad
 iaiti ke chaatro ke liye mahangi fees dena aasaan ho gaya he
 Listen carefully
 general chaatro kii fees 90,000 se badhaakar do lakh kar di gai he
 But there is no problem in giving two lakhs to the students, so the students of IIT will get loan without interest
 aane vaale samay main baaki sansthaanon ke chaatr bhi is laajawab suvidha kii maang kar sakate hai
 If the interest will be waived by adding the money that will be of interest, then they will not even know that the fees have increased
 maanav sansaadhan mantralay ko badhai deni chahie ki teen guna fees badhaane ke prastaav ko naamanzoor kar diya he
 The fees have been increased only twice
 baaki chaatro ke liye fees maaf bhi kar di gai he
 Hansega India Badhega India Show is not local
 isamen international news bhi he
 a big UK government advisor has said that obesity is not a problem of the fat man
 ye samasya us mote aadmi ke kaaran nahin he jiske zyaada khaane se motaa hua he
 There has been a news report in the Telegraph newspaper that there is no fault of obese people that they do not eat less
 iskaa doshi vahi paryaavaran he jisase ladane ke liye dilli main od evan phir se launch ho rahaa he
 Well, one cannot control overeating, but obesity is not due to the national decline of willpower
 isliye bhi hota he ki paryaavaran badal gaya he
 After this research, obese people can eat very hard that they are getting fat due to environmental reasons, not because of themselves
 tippaniyan Since when did India want to teach Pakistan a lesson, but the cricket match could not progress further
 lekin north korea bharat kii tarah sirf baaten nahin karata he
 He is happy to make a fictional video that if dropped a bomb here, look there and drop a bomb there
 is video kaa tital he agar ultimatum kaa jawaab nahin mila to
 We are thankful to North Korea that it has not changed its title mother
 is video main aap dekh sakate hai sabamarine ne washington ke upar missile daag diya he
 The House of the President of South Korea devastates the Blue House
 is tarah se wo apane mulk main in deshon main hamale kaa sapana bech rahaa he
 We are getting ridiculous day by day
 jaise hamaare yahaan bijli jane par chat par sote hue bachche jaisi baaten karte hai thik waisi baaten uttari korea is video main kar rahaa he
 Hit it like this, hit everyone
 vishwa vijeta ban gaae
 You may not have seen such a program of provoking anger at the national level from the video
 shahar ke bacchon ne bhale jangal nahin dekha he lekin aisa nahin ki ve jangal book nahin dekh sakate hai
 The smart city is not yet built, so it is becoming less infamous
 sochiye smart city ke daur main aisa hota to kya hota
 You know that Jungle Book has released a film on Friday
 is film ke siriyal rup ko hamamen se kai log doordarshan par bina maa baap ke gidence ke dekh chuke hai
 In the nineties
 lekin bharat ke ati samvedansheel sensor board ne is film ko you / e certificate diya he
 That is, children under twelve years have to go with the parents to see it
 sensor board ke chairman pehlaaj nihlani kaa kahana he ki is film main thridi effect he
 Sound effects can be scary for young children
 vaise bhi maa baap itane chote bacchon ko akele to cinema haal jane kahaan dete
 But this decision is mocking
 twitor par jo log baarah saal se bade hai wo is faisle par sirius nahin he
 Laughing a lot rashtriya ke saath saath antarrashtriya khabaren bhi
 Due to the discussion of Bharat Mata ki Jai in India, the expectations of people internationally have increased
 yahaan kai logon ne kaha he ki bharat main rahanaa he to bharat mata kii jai bolnaa hoga
 Hearing this, there is a stir in Europe
 vahaan log apni bas or naav mode kar bharat kii taraf chal padane kii baat karne lage hai
 The refugees of Europe have since heard that to stay in India, they have to be very excited
 siria, pakistan, afghanistan, iraq, kosovo, albenia, nigeria, iraan or ukraine se lakhon log europe main sharnaarthi banane ke liye aavedan de rahe hai
 Most of these people want to live in Germany
 saadhe chaar lakh se adhik logon ne germany main rahane kaa aplication diya he
 If they come to know that someone from India is offering that only by saying Bharat Mata ki Jai can get an opportunity to stay in India, then refugees can turn their boats towards India
 bharat bhi duutavaason main visa counter kii jagah bharat mata kii jai counter khol saktaa he
 Any refugee who comes to this counter and utters Bharat Mata ki Jai can be given a visa to visit India
 duniya bhar main visa dene kaa yah sabase aasaan niyam hoga
 Parinde is upset
 assam kii chunavi raily main bijepi adhyaksh ne kah diya ki hamaari sarkaar ai to bangladesh se parinda bhi par nahin maar paaegaa
 Ajmal understands the problem, but what is the problem with the birds
 paridon ko laga ki kahin parinda mukt bharat kii baat to nahin ho rahi he
 Upon hearing the flyover of the Defense Colony, Parinde bowed his head silent
 chintan manan karne lage ki insaanon ke siyaasi jhagade main ve kahaan se funs gaye
 Nobody was thinking of any way
 to inhen main ek udan ratna puraskaar se sammanit chuun chuun parinde ne hal nikaala
 Parinde said that this is an attack on our right to fly
 parinde par nahin maarenge to kya karenge
 Who is this sky for? ye zamin kiske liye hai
 We are no country of birds
 hamaara to akaash hota he
 If we want to go to Pakistan, go to Bangladesh and come back to India in the evening
 pareshaan parinde kabhi udate rahe, kabhi lautate rahe
 It was decided that Parinda will return his Udyan Ratna Award in protest against this statement of Amit Shah
 media ke saamne parindon ne ud ud kar apana virodh bhi jataayaa he
 Humans are told not to tie the boundaries of the borders
 insaanon ko rokna he to roke
 Let us not stop the birds in his name
 ab amit shah ko dar he ki parindon ke is virodh ko aam aadmi party na saport kar de
 Do not divert them on the wrong path by reciting the Kumar Vishwas poem
 parindon or paalatuon ke prati samvedansheel mantri menka gandhi ne apni chuppi nahin todi he
 Meanwhile, there has been confusion over what punishment should be given to those who do not speak Bharat Mata Ki Jai
 desh se baahar bheja jaae, unka sar kaat diya jaae yaa jabada ukhada jaae
 The first two types of punishments have come under discussion, the idea of jaw-breaking has not yet come up
 shuukravaar ke indian express main chhapi he ye khabar
 Brijmohan Aggarwal is a minister of Chhattisgarh
 inhen lagata he ki baba ramdev kaa gardan kaatane vaala idia pasand nahin aayaa
 Aggarwal, following him a bit, said that if someone in front of our workers would raise anti-national slogans, then we have the strength to lift their jaws
 agar hindustan kii dharti par tumne janam liya he
 You are eating food on the land of India and even after you die, if you get two gazes of land, then you will have to say 'bharat Mata ki Jai' on the land of India
 maine jabada todane kii baat to suni thi, ukhaadne kaa copirite agarwal ji kaa lagata he
 We asked a dentist how the jaw is lifted
 to unhone kaha bahut gambhir maamle main hi jabada ukhda jaataa he
 One and a half hour surgery is done
 bijepi ke kaaryakarta itnaa time lagaayenge to har zile main ek lakh namo ap downlod karwaane kaa target miss kar sakate hai
 When they work as a dentist, when will they download? amit shah ne kaha he ki har zile main ek lakh namo ap downlod hona chahie
 What is going to happen by not speaking so much suffering
 isse to acha he ki na bolne vaale jai bol hi den
 How angry those who ask to speak have become
 kuch to naa bolne waalon ko sochna chahie
 Swami Agnivesh has written an article in the Indian Express on Baba Ramdev's statement that his beheading statement is anti-religion
 agnivesh ji ko padhate hue main pro ramdev ho gaya
 If Baba did not love humanity, he would not make pickles, biscuits or flour for human consumption
 unka gussa agnivesh nahin samaj paa rahe hai
 Baba knows that if the millions of heads are cut off, then the noodles eaters will reduce
 phir bhi wo ye gussa bardaasht nahin kar paa rahe hai
 Thankfully, there is a constitution in the country
 unhone kaha ki is desh main kanoon he, nahin to teri ek kii kya, ham to lakhon kii gardan kaat sakate hai
 i am very sure that Baba will not do this
 gusse main kah gaye hai
 Swami will make atonement by reading Agnivesh's article
 lakhon sar kaat kar apane aate or noodles kaa nuksaan koun karegaa
 There is something that Baba did not get so angry even when he did not get black money
 nahin bolne vaale bhi kam nahin hai
 If you do not want to speak, do not speak, it is important to speak in front of Baba or not
 khwamkhah apane sar ko risk zone main kyon daalana chaahate ho bhai
 Several cases of corruption are under investigation against Himachal Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh
 unhone teen baar bharat mata kii jai bol kar congress ko bhi kanphyus kar diya he
 Virbhadra Singh said that i am a true patriot
 dil se rashtravaadi hum
 The BJP is also confused by Virbhadra Singh's Bharat Mata ki Jai
 wo samaj nahin paa rahi he ki aalochana kare yaa swaagat kare
 Virbhadra Singh has said that he will now raise the slogan of Bharat Mata ki Jai at every function
 is bich kohinoor heere ko lekar rashtrawaad sankat main aa gaya he
 The people of India and the news agencies have been claiming Kohinoor, but a Supreme Court comment may put the Kohinoor side of Indian nationalism in jeopardy
 supreme court main kohinoor ko bharat laane kii maang ko lekar yachika daayar kii gai he
 Subramanian Swamy and Prashant Bhushan, famous for the petitions, have not filed this petition
 ol india human ritis and soshal justise front ne daayar kii he
 The petitioner has also spoken of making the British High Commissioner a party
 supreme court ne kaha he ki dakshin africa, pakistan or bangladesh samet kai desh kohinoor par apana haq jataa chuke hai
 It has done what the government had to do
 phir bhi solicitre general se raay maangi gai he
 Why are you asking for a diamond that is claimed by many countries? na bolne ke liye mashhoor purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne bolne ke liye mashhoor maujuuda pradhanmantri narendra modi ko salaah di he
 It is said that there is more importance than speaking
 modi ji ko ye salaah dene ke liye manmohan singh ne bolaa he ye news he
 Before the 2014 elections, Modi used to tell Manmohan Singh that if he has done anything, then also speak
 bich main kuch muddon par jab modi ji chup hue to congressi netaaon ko manmohan singh kii yaad aane lagi he or ve modi ji ko maun modi kehane lage
 Did not understand that he was criticizing Modi ji or his former Prime Minister
 maun modi kehane se modi ji bhi kanphyus ho gaye honge isile unhone kai muddon par bolaa hi nahin
 Meanwhile, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has said that those whose names have appeared in the Panama Papers will have a sleepless night
 aise logon ko meri salaah he ki subah subah hi indian express pard len jisamen panama papers par rose kuch na kuch chap rahaa he or din main hi so len taaki raaton ko neend na aane par koi pareshaani na ho
 Now let's move to the next news
 hansega india to badhegaa india
 Don't add this slogan of Friday to Start Up India, Stand Up India
 hamaara makasad yahi he ki raajnneetik bahason ko lekar jo katutaa he wo thodi kam ho jaae
 Do not judge everything on the scale of facts
 aap jaanate hai ki do log bhaag gaye hai
 One has fled abroad and is in a country, but it is not known
 modi sarkaar ke ek mantri vaai es choudhary ko aapane kisi bas stand par dekha ho to turant telugana police ko ittela kar den
 The court sent three summons to Chaudhary Saheb but he could not appear
 ve kendriya mantrimandal main vigyaan evam technalji rajya mantri hai
 My own humor is that they might be hidden in a science lab
 marishas ke ek bank ne inke khilaaf shikaayat kii he ki choudhary ji uskaa lone nahin chukaa rahe hai
 Same to Sem Indian banks have complained that Mallya saheb is not paying their loan
 kahin aisa to nahin ki ye donon exange program ke tahat gaayab ho gaye hai
 a non-bailable warrant has been issued against Chaudhary
 inhen mantrimandal se shaayad isliye bhi nahin hataaya gaya he ki kya pataa mantripad ke laalach main ye bhaag hi na paaen
 The minister has told the court that he has some important work in Delhi, so the courts are unable to come
 mujhe mantri ji kii baat par puraa bharosa he kyonki unhone nyaaypalika ke sammaan kii baat kahi he
 So trust because YS Chaudhary owes only 106 crores to the bank of another country
 maalya sahab to 9000 karod lekar bhaage hai, sochiye bainkon kaa dil kitna dhadkta hoga
 In this panic, banks have turned down Mallya's proposal
 maalya ne kaha tha ki ve sitambar tak 4000 karod rupaya de sakate hai
 Banks said they will take all the money
 sochiye morishas kaa bank hyderabad tak pahunch kar lone difolter ke khilaaf warrant jari karvaa le rahaa he, hamaare bank yaheen se maalya ji se ummid kar rahe hai ki ve videsh main rahete hue bharat kaa paisa bharat bhijwa den
 It has become easier for IIT students to pay expensive fees
 dhyaan se sunen
 The fees of general students have been increased from 90,000 to two lakhs
 lekin chaatro ko do lakh dene main dikkat na aae isliye iaiti ke chaatro ko bina byaaj ke karj milegaa
 In the coming time, students of other institutions can also demand this wonderful facility
 jo paisa byaaj kaa lagegaa use fees main jodakar byaaj maaf kar diya jaae to unhen pataa bhi nahin chalegaa ki fees badi he
 The Ministry of Human Resources should congratulate that it has rejected the proposal to increase the fees threefold
 sirf do guna fees badhaai gai he
 Fees for the remaining students have also been waived
 hansega india badhegaa india sho local nahin he
 It also has international news
 britain kii sarkaar ke ek bade salaahkaar ne kaha he ki motopa mote aadmi kii samasya nahin he
 This problem is not due to the fat man who has become obese by eating too much
 telegraph akhbaar main khabar chhapi he ki isamen mote logon kii koi galati nahin he ki ve kam nahin kha pate hai
 The culprit for this is the same environment that Odd Even is relaunching in Delhi to fight
 thik he ki koi zyaada khaane par control nahin kar paata he lekin motopa ichhashakti ke rashtriya patan ke kaaran nahin hota he
 This also happens because the environment has changed
 is research ke baad mote log jam kar kha sakate hai ki ve apni vajah se nahin, paryaavaran ke kaarnon se mote ho rahe hai
 The comments bharat kab se pakistan ko sabak sikhaana chahta he lekin cricket match se aage baat nahin bad paati he
 But North Korea does not just talk like India
 wo kaalpanik video banaakar khush hota rahata he ki yahaan bam giraaya to vahaan dekho vahaan bam giraaya
 The title of this video is if the ultimatum is not answered
 ham north korea ke shukraguzaar hai ki usne iskaa tital maa kasam badla luungaa nahin rakhaa he
 In this video you can see Submarine has fired missile over Washington
 dakshin korea ke raashtrapati ke makaan blue house ko tabah kar detaa he
 In this way, he is selling the dream of attack in these countries in his country
 ham dinon din haasyaaspad hote ja rahe hai
 Just like we talk like a child sleeping on the roof when we go to power here, exactly the same thing North Korea is doing in this video
 ise maaraa aise maaraa sabko maaraa
 Singing to become a world winner video se rashtriya str par bhadaas nikaalane kaa aisa kaarykram aapane puri duniya main na dekha hoga
 The children of the city may not have seen the jungle but it is not that they cannot see the jungle book
 abhi to smart city nahin bana he isliye kam badanaami ho rahi he
 Think what would have happened in this era of smart city
 aap jaanate hai ki shuukravaar ko ek film reelij hui he jangal book
 Many of us have seen the serial form of this film on Doordarshan without any parental guidance
 nabbe ke dashak main
 But the highly sensitive Censor Board of India has given the film a u / a certificate
 yani baarah saal se kam ke bacchon ko ise dekhne ke liye maa baap ke saath janaa hoga
 Pahlaj Nihalani, chairman of the censor board, says that the film has a 3D effect
 sound effect chote bacchon ke liye daraavna ho saktaa he
 Anyway, where would the parents let such young children go alone to the cinema hall
 magar is faisle kaa mazaaq ud rahaa he
 Those on Twitter who are older than twelve years are not serious on this decision
 kaaphi hans rahe hai
 The refugees of Europe have since heard that to stay in India, they have to be very excited
 siria, pakistan, afghanistan, iraq, kosovo, albenia, nigeria, iraan or ukraine se lakhon log europe main sharnaarthi banane ke liye aavedan de rahe hai
 Most of these people want to live in Germany
 saadhe chaar lakh se adhik logon ne germany main rahane kaa aplication diya he
 If they come to know that someone from India is offering that only by saying Bharat Mata ki Jai can get an opportunity to stay in India, then refugees can turn their boats towards India
 bharat bhi duutavaason main visa counter kii jagah bharat mata kii jai counter khol saktaa he

 duniya bhar main visa dene kaa yah sabase aasaan niyam hoga

 aap jaanate hai ki shuukravaar ko ek film reelij hui he jangal book
 Many of us have seen the serial form of this film on Doordarshan without any parental guidance
 nabbe ke dashak main
 But the highly sensitive Censor Board of India has given the film a u / a certificate
 yani baarah saal se kam ke bacchon ko ise dekhne ke liye maa baap ke saath janaa hoga
 Pahlaj Nihalani, chairman of the censor board, says that the film has a 3D effect
 sound effect chote bacchon ke liye daraavna ho saktaa he
 Anyway, where would the parents let such young children go alone to the cinema hall
 magar is faisle kaa mazaaq ud rahaa he
 Those on Twitter who are older than twelve years are not serious on this decision
 kaaphi hans rahe hai
 Parinde is upset
 assam kii chunavi raily main bijepi adhyaksh ne kah diya ki hamaari sarkaar ai to bangladesh se parinda bhi par nahin maar paaegaa
 Ajmal understands the problem, but what is the problem with the birds
 paridon ko laga ki kahin parinda mukt bharat kii baat to nahin ho rahi he
 Upon hearing the flyover of the Defense Colony, Parinde bowed his head silent
 chintan manan karne lage ki insaanon ke siyaasi jhagade main ve kahaan se funs gaye
 Nobody was thinking of any way
 to inhen main ek udan ratna puraskaar se sammanit chuun chuun parinde ne hal nikaala
 Parinde said that this is an attack on our right to fly
 parinde par nahin maarenge to kya karenge
 Who is this sky for? ye zamin kiske liye hai
 We are no country of birds
 hamaara to akaash hota he
 If we want to go to Pakistan, go to Bangladesh and come back to India in the evening
 pareshaan parinde kabhi udate rahe, kabhi lautate rahe
 It was decided that Parinda will return his Udyan Ratna Award in protest against this statement of Amit Shah
 media ke saamne parindon ne ud ud kar apana virodh bhi jataayaa he
 Humans are told not to tie the boundaries of the borders
 insaanon ko rokna he to roke
 Let us not stop the birds in his name

 Meanwhile, there has been confusion over what punishment should be given to those who do not speak Bharat Mata Ki Jai
 desh se baahar bheja jaae, unka sar kaat diya jaae yaa jabada ukhada jaae
 The first two types of punishments have come under discussion, the idea of jaw-breaking has not yet come up
 shuukravaar ke indian express main chhapi he ye khabar
 Brijmohan Aggarwal is a minister of Chhattisgarh
 inhen lagata he ki baba ramdev kaa gardan kaatane vaala idia pasand nahin aayaa
 Aggarwal, following him a bit, said that if someone in front of our workers would raise anti-national slogans, then we have the strength to lift their jaws
 agar hindustan kii dharti par tumne janam liya he
 You are eating food on the land of India and even after you die, if you get two gazes of land, then you will have to say 'bharat Mata ki Jai' on the land of India
 maine jabada todane kii baat to suni thi, ukhaadne kaa copirite agarwal ji kaa lagata he
 We asked a dentist how the jaw is lifted
 to unhone kaha bahut gambhir maamle main hi jabada ukhda jaataa he
 One and a half hour surgery is done
 bijepi ke kaaryakarta itnaa time lagaayenge to har zile main ek lakh namo ap downlod karwaane kaa target miss kar sakate hai
 When they work as a dentist, when will they download? amit shah ne kaha he ki har zile main ek lakh namo ap downlod hona chahie
 What is going to happen by not speaking so much suffering
 isse to acha he ki na bolne vaale jai bol hi den
 How angry those who ask to speak have become
 kuch to naa bolne waalon ko sochna chahie
 Swami Agnivesh has written an article in the Indian Express on Baba Ramdev's statement that his beheading statement is anti-religion
 agnivesh ji ko padhate hue main pro ramdev ho gaya
 If Baba did not love humanity, he would not make pickles, biscuits or flour for human consumption
 unka gussa agnivesh nahin samaj paa rahe hai
 Baba knows that if the millions of heads are cut off, then the noodles eaters will reduce
 phir bhi wo ye gussa bardaasht nahin kar paa rahe hai
 Thankfully, there is a constitution in the country
 unhone kaha ki is desh main kanoon he, nahin to teri ek kii kya, ham to lakhon kii gardan kaat sakate hai
 i am very sure that Baba will not do this
 gusse main kah gaye hai
 Swami will make atonement by reading Agnivesh's article
 lakhon sar kaat kar apane aate or noodles kaa nuksaan koun karegaa
 There is something that Baba did not get so angry even when he did not get black money
 nahin bolne vaale bhi kam nahin hai
 If you do not want to speak, do not speak, it is important to speak in front of Baba or not
 khwamkhah apane sar ko risk zone main kyon daalana chaahate ho bhai

 aap jaanate hai ki shuukravaar ko ek film reelij hui he jangal book
 Many of us have seen the serial form of this film on Doordarshan without any parental guidance
 nabbe ke dashak main
 But the highly sensitive Censor Board of India has given the film a u / a certificate
 yani baarah saal se kam ke bacchon ko ise dekhne ke liye maa baap ke saath janaa hoga
 Pahlaj Nihalani, chairman of the censor board, says that the film has a 3D effect
 sound effect chote bacchon ke liye daraavna ho saktaa he
 Anyway, where would the parents let such young children go alone to the cinema hall
 magar is faisle kaa mazaaq ud rahaa he
 Those on Twitter who are older than twelve years are not serious on this decision
 kaaphi hans rahe hai
 Meanwhile, there has been confusion over what punishment should be given to those who do not speak Bharat Mata Ki Jai
 desh se baahar bheja jaae, unka sar kaat diya jaae yaa jabada ukhada jaae
 The first two types of punishments have come under discussion, the idea of jaw-breaking has not yet come up
 shuukravaar ke indian express main chhapi he ye khabar
 Brijmohan Aggarwal is a minister of Chhattisgarh

 You are eating food on the land of India and even after you die, if you get two gazes of land, then you will have to say 'bharat Mata ki Jai' on the land of India

 Swami Agnivesh has written an article in the Indian Express on Baba Ramdev's statement that his beheading statement is anti-religion
 agnivesh ji ko padhate hue main pro ramdev ho gaya
 If Baba did not love humanity, he would not make pickles, biscuits or flour for human consumption
 unka gussa agnivesh nahin samaj paa rahe hai
 Baba knows that if the millions of heads are cut off, then the noodles eaters will reduce
 phir bhi wo ye gussa bardaasht nahin kar paa rahe hai
 Thankfully, there is a constitution in the country
 unhone kaha ki is desh main kanoon he, nahin to teri ek kii kya, ham to lakhon kii gardan kaat sakate hai
 i am very sure that Baba will not do this
 gusse main kah gaye hai
 Swami will make atonement by reading Agnivesh's article
 lakhon sar kaat kar apane aate or noodles kaa nuksaan koun karegaa
 There is something that Baba did not get so angry even when he did not get black money
 nahin bolne vaale bhi kam nahin hai
 If you do not want to speak, do not speak, it is important to speak in front of Baba or not
 khwamkhah apane sar ko risk zone main kyon daalana chaahate ho bhai

 phir bhi solicitre general se raay maangi gai he
 Why are you asking for a diamond that is claimed by many countries? na bolne ke liye mashhoor purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne bolne ke liye mashhoor maujuuda pradhanmantri narendra modi ko salaah di he
 It is said that there is more importance than speaking
 modi ji ko ye salaah dene ke liye manmohan singh ne bolaa he ye news he
 Before the 2014 elections, Modi used to tell Manmohan Singh that if he has done anything, then also speak

 It is said that there is more importance than speaking
 modi ji ko ye salaah dene ke liye manmohan singh ne bolaa he ye news he
 Before the 2014 elections, Modi used to tell Manmohan Singh that if he has done anything, then also speak

 Now let's move to the next news
 hansega india to badhegaa india
 Don't add this slogan of Friday to Start Up India, Stand Up India
 hamaara makasad yahi he ki raajnneetik bahason ko lekar jo katutaa he wo thodi kam ho jaae
 Do not judge everything on the scale of facts
 aap jaanate hai ki do log bhaag gaye hai
 One has fled abroad and is in a country, but it is not known
 modi sarkaar ke ek mantri vaai es choudhary ko aapane kisi bas stand par dekha ho to turant telugana police ko ittela kar den
 The court sent three summons to Chaudhary Saheb but he could not appear
 ve kendriya mantrimandal main vigyaan evam technalji rajya mantri hai
 My own humor is that they might be hidden in a science lab
 marishas ke ek bank ne inke khilaaf shikaayat kii he ki choudhary ji uskaa lone nahin chukaa rahe hai
 Same to Sem Indian banks have complained that Mallya saheb is not paying their loan
 kahin aisa to nahin ki ye donon exange program ke tahat gaayab ho gaye hai
 a non-bailable warrant has been issued against Chaudhary
 inhen mantrimandal se shaayad isliye bhi nahin hataaya gaya he ki kya pataa mantripad ke laalach main ye bhaag hi na paaen
 The minister has told the court that he has some important work in Delhi, so the courts are unable to come
 mujhe mantri ji kii baat par puraa bharosa he kyonki unhone nyaaypalika ke sammaan kii baat kahi he
 So trust because YS Chaudhary owes only 106 crores to the bank of another country
 maalya sahab to 9000 karod lekar bhaage hai, sochiye bainkon kaa dil kitna dhadkta hoga
 In this panic, banks have turned down Mallya's proposal
 maalya ne kaha tha ki ve sitambar tak 4000 karod rupaya de sakate hai
 Banks said they will take all the money
 sochiye morishas kaa bank hyderabad tak pahunch kar lone difolter ke khilaaf warrant jari karvaa le rahaa he, hamaare bank yaheen se maalya ji se ummid kar rahe hai ki ve videsh main rahete hue bharat kaa paisa bharat bhijwa den
 It has become easier for IIT students to pay expensive fees
 dhyaan se sunen
 The fees of general students have been increased from 90,000 to two lakhs
 lekin chaatro ko do lakh dene main dikkat na aae isliye iaiti ke chaatro ko bina byaaj ke karj milegaa
 In the coming time, students of other institutions can also demand this wonderful facility
 jo paisa byaaj kaa lagegaa use fees main jodakar byaaj maaf kar diya jaae to unhen pataa bhi nahin chalegaa ki fees badi he
 The Ministry of Human Resources should congratulate that it has rejected the proposal to increase the fees threefold
 sirf do guna fees badhaai gai he
 Fees for the remaining students have also been waived
 hansega india badhegaa india sho local nahin he
 It also has international news
 britain kii sarkaar ke ek bade salaahkaar ne kaha he ki motopa mote aadmi kii samasya nahin he
 This problem is not due to the fat man who has become obese by eating too much
 telegraph akhbaar main khabar chhapi he ki isamen mote logon kii koi galati nahin he ki ve kam nahin kha pate hai
 The culprit for this is the same environment that Odd Even is relaunching in Delhi to fight
 thik he ki koi zyaada khaane par control nahin kar paata he lekin motopa ichhashakti ke rashtriya patan ke kaaran nahin hota he
 This also happens because the environment has changed
 is research ke baad mote log jam kar kha sakate hai ki ve apni vajah se nahin, paryaavaran ke kaarnon se mote ho rahe hai
 The comments bharat kab se pakistan ko sabak sikhaana chahta he lekin cricket match se aage baat nahin bad paati he

 If the interest will be waived by adding the money that will be of interest, then they will not even know that the fees have increased

 The court sent three summons to Chaudhary Saheb but he could not appear

 My own humor is that they might be hidden in a science lab
 marishas ke ek bank ne inke khilaaf shikaayat kii he ki choudhary ji uskaa lone nahin chukaa rahe hai
 Same to Sem Indian banks have complained that Mallya saheb is not paying their loan
 kahin aisa to nahin ki ye donon exange program ke tahat gaayab ho gaye hai
 a non-bailable warrant has been issued against Chaudhary
 inhen mantrimandal se shaayad isliye bhi nahin hataaya gaya he ki kya pataa mantripad ke laalach main ye bhaag hi na paaen
 The minister has told the court that he has some important work in Delhi, so the courts are unable to come
 mujhe mantri ji kii baat par puraa bharosa he kyonki unhone nyaaypalika ke sammaan kii baat kahi he
 So trust because YS Chaudhary owes only 106 crores to the bank of another country
 maalya sahab to 9000 karod lekar bhaage hai, sochiye bainkon kaa dil kitna dhadkta hoga
 In this panic, banks have turned down Mallya's proposal
 maalya ne kaha tha ki ve sitambar tak 4000 karod rupaya de sakate hai
 Banks said they will take all the money
 sochiye morishas kaa bank hyderabad tak pahunch kar lone difolter ke khilaaf warrant jari karvaa le rahaa he, hamaare bank yaheen se maalya ji se ummid kar rahe hai ki ve videsh main rahete hue bharat kaa paisa bharat bhijwa den

 The meeting of this three-member committee was scheduled to take place on Thursday but the IHF refused to acknowledge its existence

 IHF chief RK Shetty and consultant KPS Gill have also warned the World Hockey Federation (FIH) in this regard
 iechaef kaa kahana he ki ex bhartiya hockey ke maamalon main jarurat se adhik dakhsandaji na kare

 The IHF contends that the members of this committee were members of the IOA when the IHF was suspended in 2008, so it cannot be assumed that this committee will take a just decision

 If Lalu Prasad calls his old friend and rival Ram Vilas Paswan a meteorologist, then Lalu himself is a political traveler who has seen every color of the season
 satta ke shikhar kii bulandiyon ko dekha to bhrashtachar kii jail ko
 Having seen the common man's messianic style, he faced political criticism as a new foster of dynasty
 lalu kii jindagi ke tamaam pahaluon ko abhivyakt karne vaali tamaam kitaaben bazaar main ain
 People read, but this time his autobiography has arrived
 kitaab kaa naam he Gopalganj to Raisina- My Political Journey
 Lalu's autobiography has a total of 13 chapters
 shuruyaat garibi main gujarey unke bachapan se hoti he or ant apane beton kii vaahvahee se, jiske haathon main wo bihar kii bagdor dekhnaa chaahate hai
 But between these two sides, Lalu Prasad's life is the story of the formation and deterioration of an influential politician
 lalu kii yah aatmakatha desh main pehle raajnneetik badlaavon ko samajhane kaa sandarbh granth ho sakati he, jisamen desh ne 1975 main apatkaal ke rup main lokshahi par sabase bada khatra dekha tha or 1977 main pehla satta parivartan
 Although he has his own insistence on it
 baavjood iske lalu kii aatmakatha isliye pathneey he ki bihar andolan ke ye ek sakriy kaaryakarta rahe hai or sampurna kranti ke netaa jai prakaash narayan ke kareeb bhi rahe hai
 When there was an outcry among students from Gujarat to Bihar in protest against Indira Gandhi's power, one of the outrages was Lalu Prasad, who was the president of Patna University Students' Union at that time
 indira gandhi ke khilaaf un dinon samoochaa vipaksh ekajute tha chaahe ve samaajawaadee andolan ke netaa rahe hon yaa rashtriya swayamsevak sangh kii raajnneetik upaj jansangh or uskaa chaatr morcha akhil bhartiya vidhyaarthee parishad
 But in his book, Lalu Prasad writes that even during that time he had direct opposition to the RSS and ABVP and he kept hitting on them
 apane takaraav ke sandarbhon main lalu prasad bijepi ke susheel kumaar modi se lekar ravishankar prasad jaise netaaon kaa naam lete hai or ye bataane se bhi nahin chookte ki kaise bihar andolan kii ladaai ko susheel modi or ravishankar prasad jaise netaaon ne jepi ko digbhramit karke todna chaha tha
 BJP leaders will respond to Lalu's allegations, but it is true that out of all the leaders who emerged in Bihar from the JP movement, Lalu Prasad has more charismatic, mass base, directly connected with the public, understanding the problems of common people and neglected No one else has been the vocal advocate of the deprived section
 jaisaa apni jeevani main lalu likhte hai ki isaki ek vajah to khud unka garibi or badahaali main janm lenaa he
 Lalu's life is a tale of struggles in which the son of a shepherd becomes the one to decide the future of democracy
 sambhav he ki charvaaha vidhyalay kholane kaa idia lalu ke dimag main apane bachapan ke anubhav se aayaa he jo apane aap main ek anuthi pahal thi or jisaki tarif tamaam antarrashtriya sanghathanon ne bhi kiya tha
 But in the pain of Lalu, the pain of those standing on the margins shows that the elite could not understand that initiative for the betterment of poor children
 gopalganj ke ek chote se gaanv main laluaa kahalaane vaale ek ladke kaa ladakar lalu bananaa or phir satta ke shikhar par pahunchakar abhijatya naukarshahon ke munh se lalu ji kahalaane kii ladaai jitani mushkil rahi he utani hi romaanch se bhari hui bhi
 The first part of Lalu's autobiography will take you to the villages in India where life sinks in the aspect of sorrow
 haalanki jindagi kii khaasiyat yahi he ki wo vednaa main bhi apane liye samvednaa or khushiyaan talash leti hai
 Lalu Prasad has done a great illustration of how this happens
 vaise sangharshon main insaan jitna tarksheel hota he, kai baar suvidhabhogi hone ke baad wo utana hi andhvishwasi bhi ho jaataa he
 To save or retain his power, if Lalu goes to the shelter of a tantric, then at the age of 20, Lalu takes to the streets to protest against Puri's Shankaracharya, who said that Harijans are born untouchables
 ek taraf shankaracharya kaa virodh to duusari taraf lohia or jaiprakash ke vichaaron kaa asar vidhyaarthee jivan main hi lalu yadav par padane laga tha
 Lalu Yadav, who combined his struggles with the struggles of the common man, won the Lok Sabha elections at the age of 28 and reached Parliament
 lalu kii aatmakatha bhale yah bataati he ki unhone sirf sangharsh kaa rasta chunaa lekin us sangharsh ke raste ko safalataa kii manzil tak pahunchane ke liye siyaasi dimag kaa jaisaa istemaal lalu ne kiya, vaise kam rajaneta kar pate hai
 After the death of Karpoori Thakur, Lalu became the leader of socialist politics in Bihar
 1989 main jab loksabhaa chunaav jitkar sansad main pahunche to 41 saal ke lalu kii ichha thi ki wo bhi veepi sarkaar main mantri bane, lekin mauka nahin mila
 In his biography, Lalu writes that me and Nitish Kumar used to wear PMKO pajamas and used to walk in PMO but no one asked
 lekin is safagoi ke saath lalu kii tirchhi najar bihar ke mukhyamantri kii kursi par thi
 When the Janata Dal won the Bihar Assembly, VP Singh wanted Ramsunder Das to be the Chief Minister, while Devi Lal's choice was Lalu Prasad Yadav
 lalu ko andaja tha ki agar das se sidhaa muqabla hua to wo haar jaaenge
 He therefore sought help from Chandrashekhar
 chandrashekhar ne apane kareebi raghunatha jha ko maidan main utaar diya
 Lalu won by three votes in a triangular contest, and that victory changed the politics of Bihar
 10 march, 1990 ko bihar kii bagdor sanbhaalane vaale lalu prasad kaa pehla kaarykaal anoothaa rahaa
 He started working from his brother's peon's quarters
 achaanak kisi police thane main pahunch janaa to kisi eent bhatte par jaakar prabhaavshaalee jati ke logon ke haathon se kisi dalit bacchee ko chhudaana
 
 
 All these things may seem dramatic but Lalu came as a boon to the victims of exploitation
 patna ke aspataal main bukhaar se tapate apane bete ko god main lekar apni baari kaa intjaar karte kisi mukhyamantri ko bihar ne pehali baar dekha to pehali baar yah bhi dekha ki patna club ko abhijatya logon ke changul se baahar nikaalkar daliton kii pahunch tak pahunchaa diya
 This social change made Lalu the real hero of Bihar
 apni kitaab main lalu ne jin ghatnaon kaa zikr kiya he, wo unke mukhyamantri rahete hue akhabaaron kii surkhiyaan banati rahati thim
 But Lalu Prasad claims that it was his suggestion to implement the recommendations of the Mandal Commission to the then Prime Minister VP Singh
 mjedaar baat ye he ki sharad yadav se ram vilaas paswan tak sabhi netaa iskaa shrey lete hai or veepi singh kaa kahana hota tha ki vah faisla nitant unka tha
 However, through the recommendations of the Mandal Commission, the door of 27 percent reservation for the castes coming in other backward classes was opened, it was only for Lalu in Bihar
 lalu ko doosraa bada phayda hua adwani kii rath yatra ko rokkar
 Lalu Prasad has written an interesting anecdote in his book
 unka kahana he ki jab adwani kii ram rath yatra kii jaankaree unako mili to ve dilli main aakar adwani se mili
 Lalu said to Advani that if your journey comes out, i will stop him
 aam taur par sanyat rahane vaale adwani ne tilamilaakar kaha ki kisne maa kaa doodh piyaa he jo meri yatra roak degaa
 Then Lalu said that i have also drunk mother's milk and buffalo as well
 lalu ne adwani kii rath yatra ko rokane ke liye bal or buddhi donon kaa istemaal kiya
 At the time, journalists and leaders who were closely covering the Advani case said that the entire plan to stop this rath yatra was by Water Resources Minister Jagdanand Singh in the Lalu government, but Lalu did not name his most qualified minister even once

 adwani kaa rath rokkar lalu musalamaanon ke champion ban gaye or iskaa asar 1991 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main dikhaa jab avibhajit bihar kii 54 siton main 48 par janata dal or uske sahyogiyon ne jeet hasil kii
 i remember that India Today had published a cover story on Lalu and named it- The Regional Super Star
 iske baad 1995 main dobaaraa jeet ne lalu ko ahamkaari bana diya
 Lalu has accepted it himself
 chaara ghotaale kii puri kahani apni kitaab main kahi he to vanshavaad ko nae prayog ko loktantr par taal diya he
 In 1997, when Lalu decided to go to jail due to the fodder scam, he made his very own domestic wife Rabri Devi the Chief Minister
 lekin kitaab main lalu likhte hai ki ye faisla unke raghuvansh prasad singh, jagadanand, raghunatha jha jaise netaaon kaa tha
 Even though Lalu's hand left the command of power, it was not easy for RJD to maintain his power in Bihar
 2005 main argedy ke haathon se bihar nikal gaya or das saal baad tabhi aayaa jab nitish kumaar ke saath party ne mahagathbandhan kiya
 In his book, Lalu has described with great disdain, from joining hands with Nitish Kumar to breaking Nitish's alliance
 ve nitish kumaar ke khilaaf kahin bhi amaryadit hote najar nahin aate
 In 2017, Nitish Kumar retaliated and suddenly formed a government with the BJP, which in the 2015 elections had said that he would join the soil but would not join hands with the BJP
 in sabake bich lalu ne apni kitaab main dhamaakedaar khulaasa yaa kahen ki daawa kiya he ki bijepi ke saath jane ke chah maheene main hi nitish ne apane kareebi prashanth kishor ko lalu ke paas dobaaraa gathbandhan ke liye bheja tha lekin lalu ne inkaar kar diya
 However, Prashant Kishore says that this claim of Lalu is absolutely false
 jo bhi ho lekin lalu prasad kii aatmakatha padhane laayak he
 This book opens many layers of how fine and how dangerous the game of politics is
 isaki bhashaa or bhi sahaj or saral ho sakati thi or honi bhi chahie thi kyonki vahi lalu kii pahchaan he
 The book's co-author is Nalin Verma, who wrote it in both Hindi and English languages
 duusari baat kuch tathyaatmak galtiyaan hai jaise ki chandrashekhar ne 1972 main congress nahin chodi thi balki 1975 main unako congress se nikaala gaya tha or jail main daalaa gaya tha
 Similarly for VP Singh, 'raja is not a fakir'
 
 
 desh kii takadir he' kaa naaraa pradhanmantri banane se pehle hi laga tha
 Lalu has tried to cover his dynastic and Satti manipulations under the guise of democracy, but it is true that Lalu has not given heaven to the poor, backward and Dalits but has given a voice
 or usee swar ne aaj unako raajnneetik-saamaajik vimarsh ke centre main khadaa kar diya he

 That Akbar was no longer great in the syllabus
 magar ab ve kya karenge,jab modi mantrimandal kaa akbar'mahaan'nikal gaya he
 The reference to Akbar's 'greatness' in the Modi cabinet is not that he built forts, but rather created an aura of intricate English around him and then killed trust in his fort
 mahila patrakaron ke sharir or man par gaharaa zakhm diya
 What will Prime Minister Narendra Modi do to this Akbar, will the Hindi-speaking ghetto victims take advantage of Akbar's English or exclude him from his government's syllabus
 ham hindi vaale hi nahin,angrezi vaale bhi bematlab kii alankrita angrezi par fidaa ho jate hai,jiskaa matlab sirf yahi hota he ki vidwata kaa hauva khadaa ho jaae
 Akbar is nothing but the bogey of English
 bharat main is tarah kii angrezi bolne vaale gaanv se lekar dilli tak main bade vidwaan maan liye jate hai
 MJ Akbar is the name in the world of journalism that i exemplify
 main hameshaa kahata hum ki akbar bano
 First do journalism, then become an MP of a party, then get out of that party and call its leader's family a thief and then become a minister in another party
 mughalon kaa akbar mahaan tha yaa nahin,lekin modi kaa akbar vaaki'mahaan'he
 Think how today External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj will look at this Akbar, how will the women officers and employees of the Ministry of External Affairs go to this Akbar's room
 
 
 ? i am referring to MJ Akbar's 'greatness' because he has not changed any party
 rajyamantri se cabinet mantri nahin bane hai
 You know that women journalists in India are sharing their experiences of sexual exploitation in this profession
 ise angrezi main'mitu' (metoo)kaha ja rahaa he,yani mere saath bhi aisa hua he,main bhi bataanaa chaahati hum
 Under this, many women journalists have given proof of what was done in whatsapp chat with the editor-level journalist that they had indecent conversation with them and hurt their self-respect from their body
 akbar kaa paksh nahin aayaa he,intazaar ho rahaa he,intazaar pradhanmantri ke paksh kaa bhi ho rahaa he
 As part of the metoo movement, Hindustan Times political editor Prashant Jha, whose book 'how BJP wins' has been widely discussed, has had to resign
 prashanth jha ke istife se saaf nahin hua ki unhone apana dosha maan liya he or ab jaanch hogi yaa nahin,kyonki iskaa zikr hi nahin he
 In all these contexts, many women journalists have expressed their grief
 unke man or jism par ye daag lambey samay se chale aa rahe the
 i got told if i got a chance
 film abhinayta ruthik roshan ne ek aise nirdeshak ke saath kaam karne se manaa kar diya he,jis par yon shoshan ke aarope hai
 Action is being taken against the Resident Editor of the Times of India
 pradhanmantri narendra modi kya kar rahe hai,janata dekh rahi he
 In the course of the metoo campaign, journalist Rohini Singh tweeted how it could happen that women journalists are talking about big editors, but are silent about who is currently sitting in the center of power
 rohinee singh ne kisi kaa naam nahin liya,magar shaayad unki kyaati hi kuch aisi he ki sabane samaj liya ki vah jo singhaasana ke bagal main stool,yani choti kursi par baitha he,yani videsh rajyamantri ke pad par baitha he,vahi he
 He is the one who hid his 'greatness' till today
 patrkaar priya ramani ne bhi likhaa ki unhone pichley saal'vog'patrika main apane saath hue yon shoshan kaa samaran likhaa tha or kahani kii shuruyaat emje akbar ke saath hui ghatana se kii thi
 Priya did not take the name of MJ Akbar then, but wrote the name of MJ Akbar, sharing the link of the 2017 story
 kaha ki yah kahani jisase shuru hoti he,vah emje akbar he
 Priya has written that she had run away that night
 phir kabhi uske saath akele kamare main nahin gayi
 This is the Akbar who is sitting in the Modi cabinet with a room in the Ministry of External Affairs
 firstpostvebasaita par ek anaam mahila patrkaar kii dastaan padhakar aapaki aant baahar aa jaaegi
 It would be known that MJ Akbar worked with the system to hunt women, make plans, force them to come to his room
 aap is kahani ko puraa nahin pard paaenge
 When Akbar has given a deep wound to this woman journalist, what terrible that woman journalist would have had to bear in order to endure and keep it in the corner of memories
 jab bhi vah emje akbar kaa naam kahin dekhati hogi,apane zahan main vah kaali raat dekhati hogi,jab akbar ne kamare main akelaa bulaayaa,use barf nikaalane ke liye bheja or phir apane aapraadhik sparsh se use adhamra kar diya
 As soon as he turned, Akbar held him
 vah kisi tarah khud ko chhudaakar bhaagi
 Took off the sandals on the stairs and ran barefoot from that hotel in Mumbai
 pradhanmantri narendra modi kya ise padhane ke baad emje akbar ko barkhaast karenge
 
 
 The According to me, i should pay taxes or bring them in front of everyone at BJP headquarters this evening and say that i make this Akbar the Deputy Prime Minister
 bataao,tum log kya kar loge
 Huzoor, you don't know the journalists, everyone will clap
 vaah-vaah kahenge
 If a woman had made the same accusation against Rahul Gandhi, the BJP office would have been holding a press conference up to the concierge, the minister would have been giving up his work and giving a statement
 jab se emje akbar kaa naam aayaa he, bjpke netaaon ko press conference hi yaad nahin aa rahaa he
 Akbar also has a name among the journalists who have left their mark in the corridors of power in Lutyens Delhi
 modi ke satta main aane ke baad jhansa diya gaya ki satta kii chatukaarita karne vaale patrakaron ko baahar kar diya gaya
 The public could not see that the biggest name of that Lutyen faction is sitting inside
 videsh rajyamantri banakar
 The remaining anchors became Lutyens' new smoothie
 lutian dilli jeet gai
 He told that the emperor also drowns in its well and pawn drowns and floats on the surface of the water
 akbar tair rahaa he
 The Quint website and the Telegraph newspaper have reported on Akbar
 akbar telegraph ke sansthaapak sampadak the
 They are called by many surnames in journalism
 is akbar ko kis-kis santhaan ne mauka nahin diya,jabaki iske kisse sabko maaloom the
 Even when Akbar went to Modi's cabinet, his past was still in the minds of politicians
 modi or shah ko pataa na ho,yah apane aap ko bholaa ghoshit karne jaisaa he
 Still made MJ Akbar a minister
 akbar ko sab jaanate hai
 They get nervous with English, which is of no use
 jis akbar ne nehru kii shaan main kitaab likhi,vah us kitaab ke ek-ek shabd se palat gaya
 His faith in his handwriting suggests that Akbar has no faith
 vah satta ke saath he,khaskar us satta ke saath,jo50saal tak rahegi
 Modi will win the elections of four states and will say that the people are with us
 hamaare virdohi meraa virodh karte hai
 All these words will save Akbar
 magar pradhanmantri ji,janata to aapke saath ab bhi he,iskaa jawaab dijie ki akbar kyon aapke saath he

 pehle patrakarita karo,phir kisi party ke saansad ban jaao,phir us party se nikalakar uske netaa ke khandaan ko chor kaho or phir duusari party main mantri ban jaao
 Whether or not the Mughals' Akbar was great, but Modi's Akbar is indeed 'great'
 sochie,aaj videshmantri sushma swaraj is akbar se kaise nazar milaayengi,videsh mantralay kii mahila adhikari or karmchaaree is akbar ke kamare main kaise jaaengi
 
 
 The emje akbar kii'mahanata'kaa zikr isliye kar rahaa hum ki unhone koi party nahin badali he
 The minister of state has not become a cabinet minister
 aap jaanate hai ki bharat main mahila patrkaar is peshey main apane saath hue yon shoshan kaa anubhav saajha kar rahi hai
 It is being called 'metoo' in English, that is, it has happened to me too, i want to tell

 Film actor Hrithik Roshan has refused to work with a director who has been accused of sexual exploitation
action is being taken against the Resident Editor of the times of india ke resident editor ke khilaaf karrwai ho rahi he
 The public is watching what Prime Minister Narendra Modi is doing

 Rohini Singh did not name anyone, but perhaps he has something in mind that everyone understood that the one who sits on the stool, the small chair next to the throne, that is the Minister of State for External Affairs, is the same
 vahi he vah akbar,jo aaj tak apni 'mahanata'kii aad main chipa tha
 Journalist Priya Ramani also wrote that she had written about her sexual exploitation in Vogue magazine last year and started the story with an incident with MJ Akbar
 priya ne tab emje akbar kaa naam nahin liya tha,lekin2017kii story kaa link share karte hue emje akbar kaa naam likh diya
 Said that the story that begins with this is MJ Akbar
 priya ne likhaa he ki us raat vah bhaagi thim
 Never went to the room alone with her again
 ye vah akbar he,jo modi mantrimandal main videsh mantralay main cameraa lekar baitha he
 By reading the stories of an anonymous female journalist on the Firstpost website, your bowels will come out
 pataa chalegaa ki emje akbar mahilaon ko shikaar banane ke liye system se kaam karata tha,plan banaata tha,unhen majaboor karata tha apane kamare main aane ke liye
 You will not be able to read this story in its entirety
 akbar ne is mahila patrkaar ko jo gaharaa zakhm diya he,vah padhane main jab bhayanak he,to sahane or use smritiyon ke kone main bachaakar rakhane main us mahila patrkaar ko kya-kya nahin jhelana padaa hoga
 Whenever she would see the name of MJ Akbar somewhere, she would see the dark night in her mind, when Akbar called her alone to the room, sent her to take out the snow and then made her dead with his criminal touch
 uske mudate hi akbar ne use jakad liya tha
 She somehow managed to free herself
 sidhiyon par sandals utarkar phenkaa or nange paanv mumbai ke us hotel se bhaagi
 Will Prime Minister Narendra Modi sack MJ Akbar after reading this
 
 
 ?mere hisaab se kar dena chahie yaa phir aaj shamksbhjhfmukhyalay main unhen sabake saamne laakar kahana chahie ki main is akbar ko up pradhanmantri banaata hum
 Tell me what you guys will do

 Wow! yahi aarope agar kisi mahila ne rahul gandhi par lagaaya hota,toibhjhfdaphtar kaa darban tak press conference kar rahaa hota,mantri apana kaam chhodkar bayaan de rahe hote
 Ever since the name of MJ Akbar has come, BJP leaders do not remember the press conference itself
 lutian dilli main satta ke galiyaaron main jin patrakaron ne apane nishaan chode hai,unamem ek naam akbar kaa bhi he
 After Modi came to power, it was laughed out that the journalists who looted the power were thrown out
 janata dekh hi nahin saki ki us lutian gut kaa sabase bada naam to bheetar baitha he
 By becoming the Minister of State for External Affairs
 baaki jo ankar the,wo lutian ke nae chatukaar ban gaye
 Lutyens won Delhi
 usne bataa diya ki iske kuen main badshaah bhi dub jaataa he or pyaadaa duubakar pani kii sataha par tairne lagata he
 Akbar is swimming
 quint website or telegraph akhbaar ne akbar par report kii he
 Akbar was the founding editor of the Telegraph
 inhen patrakarita main kai upanaamon se bulaayaa jaataa he
 What institutions did not give this opportunity to Akbar, while everyone knew about its story
 akbar jab modi mantrimandal main gaye,tab bhi inkaa ateet rajanetaaon ke sangyaan main tha
 If Modi and Shah are not aware, it is like declaring ourselves innocent
 phir bhi emje akbar ko mantri banaaya
 Everyone knows Akbar
 unki angrezi se ghabara jate hai,jo kisi kaam kii nahin he
 Akbar, who wrote the book in the pride of Nehru, was overturned by every word of that book
 apni likhaawat ke prati uskaa yah imaan bataata he ki akbar kaa koi imaan nahin he
 It is with power, especially with power that will last 50 years
 modi chaar rajyon ke chunaav jitkar aa jaaenge or kah denge ki janata hamaare saath hai
 Our opponents oppose me
 yah sab bolkar akbar ko bachaa le jaaenge
 But Prime Minister, the public is still with you, answer why Akbar is with you

 bihar main ek-duusare ke dhur virdohi se 'kareebi' bane lalu yadav or nitish kumaar ke bich phir daraar dikhne lagi he
 Lalu, who supported JD (U) leader Jeetan Ram Manjhi's government, has started taunting Nitish
 nitish ke samarthan maangane par lalu ne kaha ki jab unke ghar main aag lagi he to ab damakal dhund rahe hai
 Lalu also said that rjd's support to the Jitan Ram Manjhi government was wrongly taken
 ab samarthan par faisla vidhayakon se baatcheet ke baad hoga
 He said, 'the decision of support has not been brought in his bag from Delhi, it will be after the plea from the mlas in Patna
 'lalu yadav ne yah bhi daawa kiya ki unhone khud nitish kumaar ko telephone kiya tha or raajnneeti ke kuch tips bhi die
 It is clear from Lalu's latest rhetoric that the RJD chief is making Nitish realize his arrogance and on the other hand he is trying to capture the mood of his mlas, while on the other hand Nitish Kumar wants to look positive
 17 june ko lalu ne rajd vidhayak dal kii baithak bulaai he usamen lalu nitish ke samarthan par faisla kar sakate hai lekin lalu, faisle ke pehle apane vidhayakon kaa mood bhaanp lenaa chaahate hai

 Leader of rebel mlas Gyanendra Singh Gyanu said that Nitish Kumar, who had abused Lalu Yadav for 17 years, left no stone unturned to send him to jail, so he should not come to Nitish's words
 baharhaal, lalu yadav ko apane kheme main bhi baghawat kaa dar sata rahaa he kyonki chunaav ke vakt kuch vidhayakon ne khulkar nitish kumaar kaa to kuch ne bijepi kaa saath diya tha aise main lalu yadav nitish ke saath aane ke pehle apni neenv majboot kar lenaa chaahate hai

 Former Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav participated in Aaj Tak's flagship show 'sidhi Baat' on Saturday and answered the questions of famous anchor Shweta Singh in an unabashed manner
 is dauraan unhone apane bhai tej pratap yadav ke saath manmutav or bihar se lekar centre kii raajnneeti tak par apni baat rakhi
 During this time, he flatly rejected being the face of his grand alliance
 jab mahagathbandhan ke chehre ke taur par rahul gandhi ke bare main poocha gaya, torashtriya janata dal (RJD) netaa tejasvi yadavane kaha ki gathbandhan kaa cheharaa koi bhi ho saktaa he
 He also said on his claim that, 'I am not the face of the alliance
 abhi bahut kaam karnaa he
 Taking a dig at the BJP, Tejashwi Yadav said, "earlier people used to doubt Rahul Gandhi, but today they are nervous about him
" wo kahin jate hai, to tabadatod reliyaan kerani padati he
 When he reached the hospital to see Atal Bihari Vajpayee, there was a stampede among BJP leaders
 'vipakshi ekajutata ke sawaal par unhone kaha ki desh or samvidhan ko bachaane ke liye vipaksh ko golband hona hoga

 ' Chhata of Chhath Mahaparva is unique

 After the domestic preparations of Chhath Mahaparva, it is the turn, the external arrangement

 In this cleaning, cleaning the water of river or pond is important, because the devotees offer arghya to the sun only by standing in water
 chhath parv main saaf safai kaa khaas mahatv he
 It is believed that Chhath Mata is the goddess of nature and she loves cleanliness
 lekin rajdhani main pichley saal kii tarah hi is baar bhichhath ghatjas ke tas pade hai
 Neither the ghats have been cleaned nor the promise of clearing water has been fulfilled
 is baar bhi yamuna ke ghaaton par gandagi kaa ambara hai aurayamuna kaa panikala he
 That is, this time the fast will not be offered to the Sun and Chhath Mata with pure water, but with black water
 haalanki aiesabiti kemuna ghatpar jor shor se tent lagaae ja rahe hai
 Water is being sprayed, but the condition of the water along the ghat remains the same
 halki-phulki safai karke bamushkil hi use saaf dikhaane kii koshish kii ja rahi hai, lekin sachai yahi hai ki is pani main sivaay gandagi ke kuch nahin he
 Chhath Puja committee member Arun Kumar told Aaj Tak that this time Manish Sisodia, Manoj Tiwari complained to everyone, but despite the complaint there is no difference in the cleanliness of the water of the Yamuna river
 aapako bataa den ki dilli sarkaar ne ye vishwaas dilaayaa tha kichhathase pehle yamuna main haryana se pani choda jayega, taaki yamuna saaf ho jaye or thodaa pani bhi bad jaye
 but that did not happen
 aiesabiti ke alaava, itio, wazirabad aadi har ghat kii yahi kahani he
 Neither the ghat is clean, nor the Yamuna has water
